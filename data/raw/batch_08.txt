0	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS POPULISM NOT AS COMMON IDEOLOGY BUT AS A COMMON STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTING VARIOUS DISTINCT IDEOLOGIES. CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND POPULIST STRATEGY ARE INHERENTLY CONNECTED. POPULIST STRATEGIES DEVELOP A SPECIFIC RHETORIC WHICH TAKES ROOT IN THE FEATURES OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THE POPULIST RHETORIC MANIPULATES THE RULE-OF-LAW AND THE MAJORITARIAN PILLARS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY BY CONVINCING A FICTIONAL MAJORITY THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY GIVES RISE TO A TYRANNY OF MINORITIES. POPULISM IN ACTION REPRESENTS THE SECOND FACET OF THE POPULIST STRATEGY. IT CORRESPONDS TO A SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY OF LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AIMING AT DISRUPTING CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. AFTER EXPOSING MY THEORETICAL ASSUMPTION, I MOVE TO A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TWO COUNTRIES, FRANCE AND HUNGARY, SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE MOST DIFFERENT CASES APPROACH. I ANALYZE FIRST HOW VIKTOR ORBAN BASED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL STRATEGY ON A PROGRESSIVE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE POST-COMMUNIST LEGACY. I STUDY THEN HOW MARINE LE PEN'S STRATEGY CONSISTED OF A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE FRENCH SEMI-PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM VIA REFERENDUM. I FINALLY CONCLUDE BY RECALLING THE ESSENTIAL ROLE ACADEMICS HAVE TO PLAY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POPULISM. MY LAST POINT IS A PROVOCATION, WHAT IF CALLING POPULISM BY ITS REAL DIVERSITY (FASCISM, RACISM AND ANTISEMITISM) WAS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO FIGHT THEM?
1	ACCORDING TO SOME SCHOLARS, ONE OF THE FEATURES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IS THAT LAWS ARE WELL RESPECTED, WHICH MEANS THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXERCISE ITS ADMINISTRATIVE POWER BASED ON EXISTING LAWS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND ALL PEOPLE SHOULD RESPECT THE RELEVANT LAWS, ON THE OTHER HAND. THIS SHOULD ALSO BE THE SPIRIT OF THE RULE OF LAW. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, IT IS TRUE THAT JUDICIAL REVIEW IS A GOOD PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT DECISIONS OR ACTIONS COMPLY WITH THE RELEVANT LAWS. IN HONG KONG, THERE IS AN INCREASING TENDENCY TOWARDS JUDICIAL REVIEW CASES. IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE OVER 100 CASES PER YEAR. WOULD THIS INCREASE IN CASES SERVE AS AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN ON THE COURTS? CERTAINLY, IT IS ALSO LEGITIMATE TO ASK THE INTENTION OF A POSSIBLE JUDICIAL REVIEW-THAT IS, WHETHER THESE JUDICIAL REVIEW CASES ARE BASED ON POLITICAL MOTIVATION TO HINDER THE PROPER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS OR TO DELAY THE BILLS RELATING TO PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS? THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND TO PROPOSE THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE MORE PRUDENT IN ITS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MECHANISM TO PREVENT JUDICIAL REVIEW FROM BEING ABUSED.
2	LEGAL CERTAINTY, A FEATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTES A REQUIREMENT FOR THE OPERATIONAL NECESSITIES OF MARKET INTERACTIONS. BUT, THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY WITH IDEALS SUCH AS LIBERALISM AND FREE MARKET ECONOMY MUST NOT LEAD TO THE HASTENED CONCLUSION THAT THEREFORE THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY WOULD BE COMPATIBLE AND TANTAMOUNT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. WE INTEND TO ANALYSE THE EFFICIENCY RATIONALE OF AN IMPORTANT GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF EU LAW-THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY. IN THIS PAPER, WE SHALL ASSERT THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE EU LEGAL CERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ENCAPSULATE AN EFFICIENCY RATIONALE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE ECJ AS SUCH. THE ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT HAS, SO FAR, NEVER BEEN ADOPTED. HENCE, WE INTEND TO FILL IN THIS GAP AND PROPOSE THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AS A PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. AFTER HAVING DECIPHERED THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY FROM A LAW AND ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE (1), WE SHALL DELVE INTO THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE ECJ SO THAT THE JUDICIAL REASONING OF THE COURT AS THIS REASONING PROVES THE RELEVANCE OF THE PROPOSED REPRESENTATION (2). FINALLY, WE CONCLUDE IN LIGHT OF THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER (3).
3	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE POLITICAL IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S (ECJ) CASE LAW CONCERNING THE FREE MOVEMENT OF EU CITIZENS AND THEIR CROSS-BORDER ACCESS TO SOCIAL BENEFITS. PUBLIC DEBATES ABOUT 'WELFARE MIGRATION' OR 'SOCIAL TOURISM' OFTEN FLUCTUATE BETWEEN POPULIST HYSTERIA AND OUTRIGHT DENIAL, BUT THEY OBSCURE THE REAL POLITICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES AT STAKE: THAT ECJ JURISPRUDENCE INCREMENTALLY BROADENS EU CITIZENS' OPPORTUNITIES TO CLAIM SOCIAL BENEFITS ABROAD WHILE NARROWING MEMBER STATES' SCOPE TO REGULATE AND RESTRICT ACCESS TO NATIONAL WELFARE SYSTEMS. WE ARGUE THAT LEGAL UNCERTAINTY CHALLENGES NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD AND RULE-OF-LAW STANDARDS, WHILE DOMESTIC LEGISLATIVE REFORMS INCREASINGLY SHIFT THE BURDEN OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY TO EU MIGRANTS BY RAISING EVIDENTIARY REQUIREMENTS AND THREATENING ECONOMICALLY INACTIVE EU CITIZENS WITH EXPULSION. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS ARGUMENT FIRST WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE EU'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK, HIGHLIGHTING THE AMBIGUITY OF CORE CONCEPTS FROM THE COURT'S CASE LAW, AND THEN WITH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE UK, GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, ANALYZING SIMILAR DOMESTIC RESPONSES TO THE ECJ'S JURISPRUDENCE. WE CONCLUDE THAT EU CITIZENSHIP LAW, WHILE PROMISING TO BUILD THE UNION FROM BELOW ON THE BASIS OF EQUAL LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS, MAY, IN FACT, RISK ROUSING FURTHER NATIONALISM AND DECREASE SOLIDARITY ACROSS THE UNION.
4	INTRODUCTION: IN THIS ARTICLE, IT IS PROPOSED A CLASSIFICATION OF TYPICAL DEFICIENCIES CONTAINED IN CIVIL LAW STUDIES, AND JUSTIFIED SOME METHODOLOGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR ELIMINATION. RESULTS: CLASSIFICATION OF TYPICAL ERRORS MADE BY CANDIDATES FOR THE DEGREES OF PHD AND LLM, PRESENTED IN TWO GROUPS: 1) SCIENTIFIC AND METHODOLOGICAL, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE DECISION TO NOT ACCEPT WORK TO THE DEFENSE (I.E. THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF DISSERTATIONS); 2) TECHNICAL, WHICH ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE DEFENSE, BUT THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES ITS ESTIMATE (IT IS TALKED PRIMARILY OF THE MASTER'S THESIS, SUGGESTING, IN CONTRAST TO DISSERTATIONS, DIFFERENTIATED ASSESSMENT). ANALYZING THE EVALUATION CRITERIA OF QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PHD AND MASTER THESIS, THE CONCLUSION IS GROUNDED ON THE NECESSITY OF UNIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS TO THE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH. THESE STUDIES HAVE TO DIFFER ONLY BY THE NUMBER OF SOLVED SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS. IT IS NOTED TO THE PROSPECTS OF CIVIL RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL SUPPORT OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, CONSIDERED IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH A STRONG RULE OF LAW AS AN EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR SOLVING SOCIAL PROBLEMS USING BUSINESS TOOLS. CONCLUSIONS: THE SCIENTIFIC-PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO REMOVAL OF COMMON ERRORS IN CIVIL LAW STUDIES ARE GIVEN.
5	ASSET FREEZES ARE SINCE 2000 BEING APPLIED BY THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) SECURITY COUNCIL (SC) TO NON-STATE ACTORS. THIS CAME ABOUT AS A 'MUTATION' OF THE SANCTIONS PROGRAM INITIATED BY RESOLUTIONS 1267 (1999), 1333 (2000) AND 1390 (2002): CURRENTLY THE TARGETS ARE ONLY SUPECTED TERRORISTS OR TERRORISM FINANCIERS. THIS 'MUTATION' HAS CREATED PERPLEXITIES AND PROBLEMS, NAMELY FOR THE EU, WHICH ENFORCES UN SC RESOLUTIONS BY A COMBINATION OF FIRST AND SECOND PILLAR METHODS. THE MAIN PROBLEM CONCERNS ISSUES OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED. THE DEBATE ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF UN SC ASSET FREEZING WITHIN EU LAW TAKES PLACE AMIDST A FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF CLARITY AS TO THE EXACT PURPOSES AND OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES OF SUCH FREEZES. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS PRACTICE AMOUNTS TO AN AD HOC (PARA-)CRIMINAL PROCEDURE MEASURE, ENACTED BY POLITICAL BODIES RATHER THAN COURTS, AND WITHOUT JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT. THE CURRENT UN SC PRACTICE OF ASSET FREEZING AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS BREACHES THE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW, AS WELL AS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. IF THIS PRACTICE IT IS TO CONTINUE AT ALL, METHODS THAT MAKE IT FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE ADOPTED. ESPECIALLY, THEIR RENEWAL AD AETERNUM SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE.
6	THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS ART. 19 II OF THE GERMAN BASIC LAW WHICH GUARANTEES THAT, IN NO CASE A BASIC RIGHT MAY BE AFFECTED IN ITS ESSENCE". THIS GUARANTEE HAS ALWAYS PUZZLED JUDGES AS WELL AS SCHOLARS BECAUSE IT LEADS INTO APORIA, AS MANY CASES PROVE. THIS APORIA IS SHOWN TO BE NO FAULT OF ART. 19 II GG, NOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. ON THE CONTRARY, THE APORETIC NORM IS A REMEDY. IT IS A NECESSARY OPENING CLAUSE OF THE POSITIVE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM TO PREVENT EXISTENTIAL BREACHES. THOUGH RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS DEMOCRACY INEVITABLY REQUIRE A SYSTEMATIC AND LOGICAL ORDER OF POSITIVE LAW, THIS INEVITABLE AIM OF THE MODERN STATE WILL NEVER BE PERFECTLY REACHED. THEREFORE, THE STATE WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A MENACE THAT IN RARE BUT NEVERTHELESS REALISTIC CASES TENDS TO DESTROY THE LIBERTIES IT SHOULD PROTECT. ART. 19 II GG IS THE TOPICAL BALANCE AND EQUILIBRIUM FOR THIS LACK OF A PERFECT SYSTEM. THUS THE APORETIC NORM TURNS OUT TO BE AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ANSWER TO THE OLD QUESTION OF PHILOSOPHY, WHETHER THINKING AND LAW-MAKING HAVE TO BE RATIONAL WITH DESCARTES, KANT, MERKL AND KELSEN OR TOPICAL WITH ARISTOTLE, CICERO, VICO AND VIEHWEG.
7	THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD) STATES THAT DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT. GIVEN THE FACT THAT BLACK AFRICA IS CURRENTLY SUFFERING WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC CRISIS AND POLITICAL DISORDER, HOW PROBABLE IS IT THAT ELECTORAL POLITICS AS IT HAS BEEN INSTITUTED OVER THE LAST DECADE WILL LEAD TO GOOD GOVERNMENT-WHICH ALL, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE AFRICA, NOW CLAIM IS THE BASIS FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH? ON THE FACE OF IT, THE ARGUMENT IS SIMPLE: DEMOCRACY SHOULD REDUCE THE SCOPE FOR CONFLICT AND MAKE GOOD GOVERNMENT MORE LIKELY. IN TURN, GOOD GOVERNMENT SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE POLITICAL STABILITY, THE INSTITUTIONAL CONSOLIDATION AND THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT ARE UNIVERSALLY SEEN AS THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTMENT. GREATER INVESTMENT SHOULD FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. GROWTH PROVIDES THE FOUNDATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE POLITICAL CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST DECADE HAVE MADE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND DEVELOPMENT MORE LIKELY IN AFRICA. IT OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF WHY IT IS THAT THE NATURE OF POLITICS IN AFRICA TODAY MAKES GOOD GOVERNMENT DIFFICULT AND RECONSIDERS THE CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE EXERCISE OF POWER OVER THE RECENT PAST.
8	THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF INITIAL TRAINING OF JUDGES IN SPAIN AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAS BEEN FOCUSED, AND IS STILL FOCUSED, ON THE MECHANICAL DIGESTION OF A PILE OF STEREOTYPED NOTIONS RELATED TO SEVERAL LEGAL SUBJECTS. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS PRESENTED WITH NO REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC LEGAL DISPUTES AND DOES NOT MEET AT ALL, NEITHER THE PROFILE OF MODERN COMPLEX CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS CONSISTING OF SEVERAL LEVELS, INTERNALLY CHANGING AND CONFLICTING; NOR THE PRACTICE OF THOSE SYSTEMS. IT DOES CORRESPOND, HOWEVER, THE HISTORICAL MODEL OF THE NAPOLEONIC JUDGE, WHO TENDS TO ACT AS A MECHANICAL ENFORCER OF THE LAW AND THE LONGA MANU OF THE REAL POWER RATHER THAN GUARDIAN OF THE CITIZENS' BASIC RIGHTS. THE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS KIND OF JUDICIAL TRAINING WOULD BE A SYSTEM OF TRAINING INCORPORATING A HIGH QUALITY OPERATIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSITIVE LAW ACTUALLY IN FORCE, TOGETHER WITH A THEORETICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL TRAINING IN LINE WITH THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY MANUEL SACRISTAN OF .A LEVEL OF EXERCISE OF THINKING >> BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FIELD AND ACTIVITY INHERENT TO THAT GROUP OF LEGAL PRACTITIONERS.
9	COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE ARE FACING ECOLOGICAL CRISES, AND IMPROVING GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL QUALITY THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IS KEY TO ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AS THE LARGEST DEVELOPING COUNTRY, CHINA'S RESPONSE TO DIVERSE ECOLOGICAL CONFLICTS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS CONSIDERABLY IMPACTS GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL CONSERVATION. BASED ON 2008-2020 PANEL DATA FROM 30 PROVINCES, THIS STUDY MEASURES THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS AND TIME-SERIES EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES USING THE ENTROPY WEIGHT METHOD AND THE THEIL INDEX MODEL. QUADRATIC ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE AND QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS MODELS WERE COMBINED TO EXPLORE THE DETERMINANTS AND DRIVING MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PREVALENT UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND DISPARITIES IN REGULATION PERFORMANCE MAINLY ORIGINATE FROM INTER-REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. POLITICAL FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE DECISION VALUE AND DECISION DECENTRALIZATION; ADMINISTRATIVE FACTORS ARE COMMAND-BASED REGULATIONS; AND RULE-OF-LAW FACTORS INCLUDE PROJECT, FINANCIAL, AND SUBJECT REGULATION. FURTHERMORE, THESE THREE FACTOR TYPES CAN INTERACT TO FORM EIGHT HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION PERFORMANCE PATHS AND SEVEN NON-HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION PATHS, WHICH TOGETHER CONSTITUTE THE DRIVING MECHANISM FOR PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES. THIS STUDY ENRICHES THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES FROM THE PUBLIC MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE, WHICH CAN GUIDE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION POLICY OPTIMIZATION AND PROMOTE HIGH-LEVEL, BALANCED ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT.
10	THE PRESENT STUDY HAS CONDUCTED A DIACHRONIC ANALYSIS OF LAW AND ORDER METAPHORS IN A SELF-COMPILED CORPUS OF CHINA'S GOVERNMENT WORK REPORTS (CGWR) OVER A SPAN OF 22 YEARS (2000-2021). BY MAPPING TARGET DOMAINS WITH SOURCE DOMAINS, WE CATEGORIZED FOUR MAJOR TYPES OF LEGAL METAPHORS, INCLUDING BUILDING, PHYSICAL OBJECT, JOURNEY, AND LIVING BEING, AMONG WHICH PHYSICAL OBJECT WAS OVERWHELMINGLY PREDOMINANT. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS METAPHORICAL EXPRESSIONS THAT HIGHLIGHT PHYSICALITY MORE THAN SPECIFICITY WILL CONSTANTLY REMAIN IN USE BECAUSE THE STABILITY AND UNIVERSALITY OF SUCH METAPHORS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE DISSEMINATION AND REINFORCEMENT OF LEGAL THOUGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN LEGAL METAPHORS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL CONCERNS, AS EVIDENCED BY INCREASING ATTENTION PAID TO VARIOUS SECURITY ISSUES AND NEW CHALLENGES IN CHINA. GIVEN THAT THE RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BECOMES MORE INSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND SYSTEMATICALLY THEORIZED, LEGAL METAPHORS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN A TOP-DOWN MANNER TO JUSTIFY THE EXERCISE OF POWER IN CGWRS, MAKING CHINESE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED WITH THE GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY AND FURTHER CONTRIBUTING TO THE IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION OF DISCOURSE. THIS STUDY IS THUS CONDUCIVE TO A GENERAL BUT INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POLITICAL STANCES ARE EMBODIED AND REINFORCED PERSUASIVELY IN DISCOURSE.
11	LEGAL ADVOCACY IN THE FORM OF LEGAL AID IS CRUCIAL FOR ALL PEOPLE AS THE BAD APPLICATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IRONI-CALLY LEADS TO A CONDITION WHERE THE LAW SPOILS SOME GROUPS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY MARGINALIZING OTHERS IN SOCIETY. MU-HAMMADIYAH, ONE OF THE LARGEST ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS IN IN-DONESIA PROVIDES LEGAL AID BASED ON TRANSCENDENTAL VALUES TO ENFORCE ONE OF ITS PILLARS, WHICH IS OBEYING ALL OF INDONESIA'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS. METHODS: THIS RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT USING THE NORMATIVE EMPIRICAL METHOD BY COMBINING THE NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL LEGAL RESEARCH METHODS THROUGH A JUDICIAL CASE STUDY. THIS LEGAL AIDS ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGT TO HELP THE CITIZEN WITHOUT VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: THE LAWS APPLIED FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW INCLUDE LAWS ON OIL AND GAS, HOSPITALS, SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND WATER RESOURCES. THIS LEGAL AID EMPHASIZES DIVINE VALUES SOURCED FROM RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS AND PHILOSOPHIES TO BECAME A BASE OF ACTION. LEGAL AID ETYMOLOGICALLY MEANS THE EFFORT TO ACHIEVE VIRTUES WITHOUT VIOLATION, THIS MEANS NO NEED A VAN-DALISM AT AL. CONCLUSSION: TRANSCENDENTAL JUSTICE-BASED LEGAL AID IS ALSO A BASIS ON HOW THE POSITIVE LAW ON LEGAL AID APPLIES WITH THE BASIS OF THE VALUES OF ETHICS, MORALS, AND TRANSCEND-ENCE.
12	DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FEW STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ITS GROWTH. THIS RESEARCH ADDS TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE BY EMPIRICALLY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF NUMEROUS FACTORS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN 15 MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN (MENA) COUNTRIES FROM 2000 TO 2017. THE STUDY LOOKS AT MACROECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AS POTENTIAL DRIVERS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S GROWTH, WITH THE INSURANCE PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. ALL VARIABLES ARE STATIONARY AT THE FIRST DIFFERENCE, ACCORDING TO THE IPS PANEL UNIT ROOT TEST. THE PEDRONI RESIDUAL COINTEGRATION TEST, KAO RESIDUAL COINTEGRATION TEST, AND JOHANSEN-FISHER PANEL COINTEGRATION TESTS ARE THEN USED TO LOOK FOR LONG-RUN ASSOCIATIONS. THE COINTEGRATION TESTS STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE INSURANCE PREMIUM AND THE VARIOUS VARIABLES HAVE LONG-RUN CORRELATIONS. FINDINGS FROM THE FULLY-MODIFIED OLS IMPLY THAT GDP PER CAPITA, GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, AND THE KOF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION INDEX HAVE A POSITIVE LONG-TERM IMPACT ON THE INSURANCE BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IS ALSO DRIVEN BY COMBATING CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE POPULATION AND REGULATORY QUALITY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.
13	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-BASED SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS FACIAL RECOGNITION, EMOTION RECOGNITION AND OTHER BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY INTRODUCED BY BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD, RAISING MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR IMPACT ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL FOR REGULATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, KNOWN AS THE AI ACT, IN ADDRESSING THE THREATS AND RISKS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS POSED BY AI BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS. IT ARGUES THAT IN ORDER TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS RISKS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THE PROPOSED CLASSIFICATION OF THESE SYSTEMS SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED. ALTHOUGH THE DRAFT AI ACT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SOME AI PRACTICES SHOULD BE PROHIBITED, THE MULTIPLE EXCEPTIONS AND LOOPHOLES SHOULD BE CLOSED, AND IN ADDITION NEW PROHIBITIONS, IN PARTICULAR TO EMOTIONAL RECOGNITION AND BIOMETRIC CATEGORISATION SYSTEMS, SHOULD BE ADDED TO COUNTER AI SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES VIOLATING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE AI ACT SHOULD ALSO INTRODUCE STRONGER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THIRD-PARTY CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT, TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS ENHANCE EXISTING EU DATA PROTECTION LAW AND THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS, THUS NOT MISSING THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT THE FIRST LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT TRULY PROMOTES TRUSTWORTHY AI.
14	ACLASSIC QUESTION IN ECONOMICS IS HOW TO EXPLAIN DIFFERENCES IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS COUNTRIES. FOR RESEARCHERS FOCUSED ON SUBSAHARAN AFRICA, THE CORRESPONDING QUESTION HAS LONG BEEN HOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT EASTERLY AND LEVINE (1997) MEMORABLY CALLED THE "AFRICAN GROWTH TRAGEDY." A STANDARD STARTING POINT TO STUDY THESE DIFFERENCES HAS BEEN TO LOOK AT DISPARITIES IN THE FACTORS OF PRODUCTION LIKE HUMAN CAPITAL AND PHYSICAL CAPITAL, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER, GROWTH ACCOUNTING EXERCISES SUGGEST THAT SUCH EXPLANATIONS ACCOUNT FOR, AT MOST, 50 PERCENT OF THIS VARIATION IN SALIENT SETTINGS (FOR EXAMPLE, HSIEH AND KLENOW 2009). THUS, THE QUESTION BECAME WHY THE ECONOMIES OF COUNTRIES WERE PERFORMING SO MUCH BETTER OR WORSE THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT BASED ON THEIR FACTORS OF PRODUCTION. FOR MUCH OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD, NEWLY DEVELOPED EXPLANATIONS OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS INCLUDE FRICTIONS IN TRANSPORTATION, MARKET ACCESS AND INFORMATION, INEFFICIENT REGULATION, AS WELL AS IN THE DISPARITY IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, TO NAME A FEW. THAT IS, POLITICS, TECHNOLOGY, AND HISTORY MIGHT ALL BE RELEVANT IN EXPLAINING SUCH DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH THROUGH INDUCING SUBOPTIMAL CHOICES BY FIRMS AND CITIZENS. WITH SUCH MECHANISMS, THERE IS A CLEAR SCOPE FOR POLICY TO IMPROVE WELFARE BY ALLEVIATING THESE FRICTIONS.
15	THE RESEARCH AIM IS TO EMPIRICALLY STUDY THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IN 86 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DURING 2008-2018. THIS STUDY COLLECTS KEY DATA FROM THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS (WDI). INSTITUTION INDICATORS ARE COLLECTED FROM THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI). TO CARRY OUT THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS THROUGH SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (S-GMM). THE RESEARCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT FDI POSITIVELY IMPACTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. IN PARTICULAR, GOVERNMENTAL EFFICIENCY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND NON-VIOLENCE, QUALITY REGULATIONS, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FDI-ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION NEXUS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THESE COUNTRIES IN QUESTION NEED TO CONSIDER VERY CAREFULLY WELCOMING FDI INFLOWS. IN OTHER WORDS, HOST GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BUILD 'FILTER FUNNEL' TO ATTRACT FDI FOR LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, THEY ALSO HAVE TO MANAGE STRICTLY FOREIGN INVESTED ENTERPRISES DOMESTICALLY IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON ENVIRONMENT QUALITY. FOR A STABLE GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT, EACH COUNTRY MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS, AND PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES MUST COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND RAISE AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AS THE FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.
16	BACKGROUND: ALCOHOL USE IS A MAJOR RISK FACTOR IN PREMATURE DEATH AND DISABILITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUTH. EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES TO PREVENT AND CONTROL THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT OF ALCOHOL USE HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED. IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK ALCOHOL CONTROL POLICIES-SUCH AS LEBANON, STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION TO INFLUENCE POLICY INTERVENTIONS. THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE VIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING A NATIONAL ALCOHOL HARM REDUCTION POLICY FOR YOUTH. METHODS: WE INTERVIEWED A TOTAL OF 22 KEY STAKEHOLDERS OVER A PERIOD OF 8 MONTHS IN 2015. STAKEHOLDERS WERE SELECTED PURPOSIVELY, TO INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INDUSTRY THAT COULD ANSWER QUESTIONS RELATED TO CORE INTERVENTION AREAS: AFFORDABILITY, AVAILABILITY, REGULATION OF MARKETING, AND DRINKING AND DRIVING. WE ANALYZED INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THREE THEMES EMERGED: INADEQUACY OF CURRENT ALCOHOL CONTROL POLICIES; WEAK GOVERNANCE AND DISREGARD FOR RULE OF LAW AS A DETERMINANT OF THE STATUS QUO; AND DIVERTING OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS 'OTHER' STAKEHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES ARGUED AGAINST EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES USING TIME-WORN STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED GLOBALLY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ALCOHOL HARM REDUCTION POLICIES ARE FAR FROM BECOMING A POLICY PRIORITY IN LEBANON. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO SHIFT THE NARRATIVE FROM VICTIM BLAMING TO STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS.
17	IN THIS PAPER WE ANALYZE ATTITUDES OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS IN CROATIA AND SERBIA WITH REGARDS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS - THE TRUST IN JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SATISFACTION WITH THEIR PERFORMANCE. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER WE PRESENT ARGUMENTS OF THE CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO EXPLAINING THE FOUNDATIONS OF TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS, THEN DEFINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A "GOOD" JUDICIARY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, AND PRESENT THE SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT OF JUDICIAL REFORM IN BOTH COUNTRIES OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IN THE SECOND, EMPIRICAL PART OF THE PAPER WE ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE ONLINE SURVEY CONDUCTED AMONG MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS IN 2018 IN CROATIA AND SERBIA. THE RESULTS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES SHOW A LOW LEVEL OF TRUST IN JUDICIARY AND DEEP DISSATISFACTION WITH THE FUNCTIONING OF JUDICIARY ON A LIST OF DIMENSIONS. OUR ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THE LINK BETWEEN (DIS)TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS AND (DIS)SATISFACTION WITH THEIR WORK AND THUS ALSO THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON TRUST. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE OBTAINED RESULTS POINT TO AN "INTERNAL" CRISIS OF TRUST IN JUDICIARY IN BOTH COUNTRIES, WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE EVIDENT "EXTERNAL" CRISIS OF THE SERBIAN JUDICIARY AND THE LATENT TENSIONS IN AND AROUND THE CROATIAN JUDICIARY.
18	CREATED IN 1997 AS PART OF A MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM, THAILAND'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS SINCE BECOME EMBROILED IN SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE POLITICAL CONTROVERSIES. SINCE THE 2006 COUP, BECAUSE A NUMBER OF SUCH DECISIONS HAVE FAVOURED ONE POLITICAL CAMP AND CONSIDERING OBVIOUS CLOSE AND LONG-STANDING RELATIONS BETWEEN JUDGES AND POLITICAL ELITES, QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN ABOUT THE COURT'S ABILITY TO ACT AS AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER. IS THIS VIEW JUSTIFIABLE? TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, THIS ARTICLE FIRST ANALYSES HOW THE COURT HAS BEHAVED ACROSS POLITICAL ADMINISTRATIONS IN 32 HIGH-PROFILE CASES SINCE 2001. IT THEN TURNS TO THE SOCIO-BIOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE BENCH, THE POLITICS OF NOMINATIONS AND CHANGES TO ITS COMPOSITION, PARTICULARLY SINCE 2006. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS DATA ON PARTICIPANTS IN CLASSES OFFERED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LINKS BETWEEN THAI POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL NETWORKS. THE ANALYSIS FINDS EVIDENCE OF POLITICALLY BIASED VOTING PATTERNS AND INCREASINGLY PARTISAN NOMINATIONS TO THE COURT, THOUGH FORMALLY APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES ARE APOLITICAL, WHICH SUGGESTS THE POLITICISATION OF THE COURT AND GROWING TIES BETWEEN JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL ELITES. THESE FINDINGS RAISE NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S LEGITIMACY AND PROSPECTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
19	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW COMMUNITY POLICING TAKES ON ITS ACTUAL MEANINGS IN THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONTEMPORARY HONG KONG. HONG KONG PEOPLE PLACE TREMENDOUS STAKE ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BECOME ONE OF THE ACCLAIMED 'CORE VALUES' DISTINGUISHING THE POST-HANDOVER HONG KONG FROM THE REST OF CHINA. AGAINST THIS SOCIAL BACKGROUND, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT LARGELY DUE TO THE NON-DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURING OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE, LAW IS INADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN A LOCALLY GIVEN ORDER, AND THEN COMMUNITY POLICING VESTED WITH THE NECESSARY POLICE DISCRETION IS VERY OFTEN ADOPTED TO ACCOMMODATE THE REAL NEEDS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THIS ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE INDUCTIVE ANALYSIS BY USING A CASE STUDY OF THE POLICING OF A MARKETPLACE IN HONG KONG. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION CONSISTENTLY CALLS FOR THE POLICE'S STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF LAW IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE COMMUNITY PROBLEMS GENERATED BY THE ROUTINE OPERATION OF THE MARKETPLACE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POLICE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AGAINST SUCH A CALL BY DISCRETIONARILY HANDLING THE EXTRA-LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MARKETPLACE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE CURRENT STUDY REVEALS THAT ONE OF THE ACTUAL MEANINGS OF HONG KONG'S COMMUNITY POLICING IS DEFINED BY THE CONTRADICTORY JUXTAPOSITION SITUATED BETWEEN THE OFFICIAL IDEAL AND LOCAL REALITY.
20	AIMS - OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LIFETIME USE OF TOBACCO, ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS AMONG SCHOOL STUDENTS AGED 15-16 IN ALBANIA IN ORDER TO MAKE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE FOR HEALTH PROMOTION SPECIALISTS WORKING ON SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION. DESIGN - THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN MARCH-MAY 2011 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN SCHOOL SURVEY PROJECT ON ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS (ESPAD). IN TOTAL, 3189 STUDENTS BORN IN 1995 PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY. THE STANDARDISED ESPAD QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE. RESULTS - OUR MULTIVARIABLE ADJUSTMENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT BEING A MALE AND HAVING EASY ACCESS TO CIGARETTES WERE THE ONLY UNIVERSAL FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF EVER USING TOBACCO, ALCOHOL OR CANNABIS. OWN SMOKING WAS STRONGLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS USE. THE ASSOCIATIONS OF OWN SUBSTANCE USE WITH PEER SUBSTANCE CONSUMPTION WERE WEAK TO MODERATE. CONCLUSIONS - OWN SMOKING SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR WHICH STRONGLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS USE AMONG ALBANIAN SCHOOL STUDENTS. POLICY MAKERS NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW WHEREAS HEALTH PROMOTION PROFESSIONALS SHOULD FIRMLY ADDRESS SMOKING IN ADOLESCENCE THROUGH TARGET INTERVENTIONS.
21	TO SCHMITT, A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM IS A DIRECT PRODUCT OF THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS BY ITSELF AN ATTEMPT OF BOURGEOISIE TO PROTECT ITSELF FROM THE STATE, AND AS SUCH AN ANTI-POLITICAL FORM. AS THE WHOLE LIBERAL POSITION OF BOURGEOISIE, THE PARLIAMENTARISM IS INCONSISTENT IN ITS POSITION TOWARDS POLITICAL MATTERS. THE SECOND PROBLEM OF PARLIAMENTARISM IS THAT IT HISTORICALLY REPRESENTS A TOOL OF BOURGEOISIE TO INTEGRATE IN THE MONARCHIC STATE AND ACHIEVE POLITICAL UNITY. THE HISTORICAL ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE BOURGEOISIE AND PROLETARIAT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE SOLVED EVEN IN A PRESENT DAY STATE, BEING IT PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE POST-COMMUNIST STATES, BUT ALSO THE REST OF THE WORLD, AS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE LATEST ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE LIBERAL TIES OF PARLIAMENTARISM WITH REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY BASED ON INDIVIDUAL SECRET BALLOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM. THESE NOTIONS ARE FOR SCHMITT CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY. A SOVEREIGN IS THE ONE WHO DECIDES ABOUT THE STATE OF EXCEPTION WITHIN THE LEGAL ORDER. THIS POWER IS NOT ONLY A LEGAL BUT ALSO A FACTUAL QUESTION. EVERY POLITICAL SUBJECT ASPIRING TO GAIN INDEPENDENCE SHOULD NOTE THIS FACT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CLAIM THE SOVEREIGN POWER.
22	UNTIL NOW, THE TERRORIST CHALLENGE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BY THE ROTE ARMEE FRAKTION" (RAF) IN AUTUMN 1977 HAS BEEN PRIMARILY ANALYZED IN TERMS OF ITS DOMESTIC AND SOCIO-POLITICAL DIMENSIONS. IT IS LESS WELL KNOW THAT THE KIDNAPPING OF HANNS MARTIN SCHLEYER AND THE HIJACKING OF LUFTHANSA AIRPLANE "LANDSHUT" ALSO POSED A CRUCIAL TEST OF STRENGTH FOR THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. NEWLY RELEASED FILES FROM THE GERMAN FOREIGN OFFICE FOR THE FIRST TIME ALLOW FOR A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THESE DECISIVE MONTHS THROUGH THE USE OF OFFICIAL STATE SOURCES, THUS PLACING ITS CRISIS MANAGEMENT INTO THE LARGER CONTEXT OF WEST GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY AND THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. BONN HAD TO FACE THE DIFFICULT DIPLOMATIC TASK OF ENSURING THE COOPERATION NOT ONLY OF FRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS, BUT ALSO OF STATES TO WHICH THERE WERE VIRTUALLY NO RELIABLE RELATIONS OR WHICH EVEN HAD A REPUTATION OF BEING SYMPATHETIC TO TERRORIST MOVEMENTS. IN RETURN FOR ASSISTANCE IN FREEING THE HIJACKED AIRCRAFT IN MOGADISHU, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS ULTIMATELY EVEN READY TO MAKE AN INDIRECT AND COVERT EXCEPTION FROM ITS RESTRICTIVE MILITARY EXPORTS POLICY FOR SOMALIA, WHICH WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE CONFLICT AT THE HORN OF AFRICA.
23	THIS PAPER PRESENTS ONE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL POSITIVISM: THE SEPARATION OF LAW AND MORALS. THIS PRINCIPLE IS BASED ON THE VIEW THAT MORALITY IS INTRINSICALLY SUBJECTIVE, WHILE LAW PRESENTS OBJECTIVE STANDARDS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THERE IS A VALID SOURCE FOR IDENTIFYING THE MORALITY WHICH IS NOT INDIVIDUALISTIC BUT SHARED BY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY. THIS SOURCE IS FOUND IN SIMPLE NARRATIVES OF FOLKTALES. THE LAWYERS NEED FOLKTALES TO IDENTIFY MORAL PRINCIPLES SHARED BY THE COMMUNITY WHEN IT IS WARRANTED BY THE LETTER OF LAW ITSELF (SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES). EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO APPARENT NEED TO DETERMINE THE CONTENT OF PUBLIC MORALITY, FOLKTALES ARE STILL HELPFUL IN PRESENTING PRINCIPLES AND ILLUSTRATIONS THAT ARE VITAL TO GRASP THE SPIRIT OF LAW. THE CONTEMPORARY LAW MOVES TOWARDS INCREASING TECHNICALITY, AND THEREFORE, IT POSES A CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. IN THE TECHNICALITIES OF LAW, THE SPIRIT OF LAW IS OBLITERATED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SEEN IN THE COUNTRIES SUCH AS THAILAND AND CHINA. THOSE COUNTRIES VIEW LAW AS A MACHINE OF SOCIAL CONTROL AND MANIPULATION. LAW BECOMES THE MEANS OF OPPRESSION. THE CULTURAL ROOTS OF LAW ARE IGNORED. FOLKTALES CONTAIN A MESSAGE OF WISDOM SO DESPERATELY NEEDED AMONG ASIAN LAWYERS ADDICTED TO LEGAL FORMALISM.
24	IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM IN DIVIDED SOCIETIES IS OFTEN STRAINED AND MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE TAILORING, BUT HOW FAR SHOULD THAT GO? CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS - TRADITIONALLY CONCEIVED AS INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL GUARDIANS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW - SEEM TO DEFEAT THE POINT OF CONSENSUAL DECISION-MAKING SETTLEMENT PROMISED BY CONSOCIATIONAL POWER-SHARING SOLUTIONS FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED FOR DEEPLY DIVIDED SOCIETIES. ONE WAY OF CUTTING THIS GORDIAN KNOT IS BY OFFERING A HYBRID SOLUTION, A SORT OF CONSOCIATIONALISED CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THE LEGITIMACY OF SUCH AN INSTITUTION, IN THE CONTEXT OF A CONSOCIATIONAL POLITICAL REGIME, IS TO BE SECURED BY IT ITSELF BECOMING A 'POWER-SHARING COURT', STRONGLY REFLECTING THE SALIENT CLEAVAGES DIVIDING THE SOCIETY, AND INCORPORATING POWER-SHARING ELEMENTS IN ITS STRUCTURE AND DECISION-MAKING RULES. IN DEEPLY DIVIDED SOCIETIES WHERE SUCH CLEAVAGES ARE ETHNIC ONES, AND THEY OFTEN ARE, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WOULD BE AN ETHNIC COURT. THIS CHAPTER CRITICALLY EXAMINES SUCH A MODEL, BY FOCUSING ON THREE SUCH COURTS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, IN PARTICULAR THE BOSNIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, OFTEN SEEN AS AN EXAMPLE OF A 'STRONG POWER-SHARING COURT'. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONSIDERS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STANDARD MODEL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CAN BE BENT OUT OF SHAPE, WHILE RETAINING ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTIONS.
25	THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDEPENDENCE IS THE CORE OF THE IDEA OF A COMMON HOME, A NOTION INTRODUCED INTO THE PUBLIC DEBATE BY THE ENCYCLICAL LAUDATO SI', AND ONE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME THE ANTHROPOCENTRIC NARROWNESS OF THE ETHICAL-LEGAL NORMATIVITY ON WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS BASED. THE THEOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE FORMULATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERDEPENDENCE IS EMBEDDED IN A RICH LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION, WHICH HAS IN C. SCHMITT A LEADING EXPONENT. THANKS TO THE JURIDICAL SPATIAL TURN OUTLINED BY THIS AUTHOR, WE MAY RECOGNIZE THAT LAW REGULATES NOT ONLY INTER-HUMAN RELATIONS BUT ALSO INTER-SYSTEM RELATIONS BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE EARTH'S ECOSYSTEM. TO IMPLEMENT A CORRESPONDING STRUCTURAL CHANGE, HOWEVER, WE NEED MOVE BEYOND SCHMITTIAN REDUCTIONISM, WHICH UNIVOCALLY ASSOCIATES THE IDEA OF LAW WITH THE PHYSICAL DIMENSION OF THE OCCUPATION OF SPACE AND ITS RATIONAL INSCRIPTION AS PROPERTY AND SOVEREIGNTY, A FORM OF PREDATORY APPROPRIATION AND DOMINATION WHICH HAS BROUGHT US TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL DISORDER. ONLY BY JURIDICALLY IMPLEMENTING INTERDEPENDENCE AS A NEW REGULATOR OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EARTH AND SOCIETY AND OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLES CAN WE POLITICALLY GOVERN AND SOLVE THE ONGOING (ECOLOGICAL, HEALTH, SOCIAL, AND INTERNATIONAL) WORLD CRISIS.
26	WITH CLIMATE CHANGE, MELTING SEA ICE AND SNOW IN THE ARCTIC INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT STATES ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THERE. THE PROSPERITY OF ARCTIC ACTIVITIES SERVES AS A REMINDER TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE ISSUE OF ARCTIC GOVERNANCE MUST BE PRIORITISED TO AVOID ARCTIC UNSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AS A MAJOR STAKEHOLDER BESIDES THE ARCTIC STATES, IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY CHINA'S ROLE IN ARCTIC GOVERNANCE FOR ITS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR THE DIPLOMATIC DECISION-MAKING OF OTHER STATES. THE PAPER SELECTS INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A PERSPECTIVE. IT DISCUSSES CHINA'S ENGAGEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW RELATED TO THE THEME FROM THE GLOBAL, REGIONAL, AND BILATERAL/MULTILATERAL LEVELS. AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, CHINA'S NATIONAL ROLE IS CHARACTERIZED BY ENGAGING IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW FOR GUARDING THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER BASED ON INTERNATIONAL LAW. AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL, CHINA MAINTAINS THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING IN THE ARCTIC COUNCIL, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ITS ESTABLISHMENT. AT THE BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL LEVELS, CHINA, AS AN ARCTIC STAKEHOLDER PURSUING COOPERATION, HAS ACHIEVED MANY COOPERATION RESULTS. THE PAPER HOLDS THAT UNDER CHINA'S NATIONAL ROLES, CHINA'S ENGAGEMENT HAS AFFECTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW REFERRED TO THE THEME TO SOME EXTENT.
27	SOGHOMON TEHLIRIAN WAS ACQUITTED IN BERLIN IN 1921 FOR THE KILLING OF TALAT PASA, OTTOMAN MINISTER AND ARCHITECT OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. COMPLICATING CLEAR-CUT DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN TRUTH AND FABULATION, AND PERSONAL REVENGE AND LEGAL JUSTICE, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE 1921 TRIAL IN LIGHT OF TEHLIRIAN'S 1953 MEMOIR, TO SHOW THE LEGAL, MORAL, AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL WORK DONE BY THE GHOST OF TEHLIRIAN'S MOTHER. I MOVE BEYOND THE USUAL DESIGNATIONS OF TEHLIRIAN AS MERE POLITICAL ASSASSIN OR SELF-EVIDENT MORAL WITNESS AND CONSIDER HIM INSTEAD AS AN "EMPIRICAL FABULIST." MY COINAGE OF THE TERM EMPIRICAL FABULATION IS ANIMATED BY SAIDIYA HARTMAN'S (2008) CALL FOR "CRITICAL FABULATION," AND MY READING OF TEHLIRIAN AS AN EMPIRICAL FABULIST RECOGNIZES HIM AS A GENOCIDE SURVIVOR WHO ASPIRED FOR COLLECTIVE JUSTICE, A SON HAUNTED BY HIS MOTHER'S GHOST, AND A HISTORICAL ACTOR WHO GAVE A FABRICATED TESTIMONY THAT WAS NONETHELESS BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL FACTS OF GENOCIDE. THIS PAPER IS AN INVITATION TO EXPLORE THE POLITICAL AND ETHICAL POTENTIAL, AND PERHAPS EVEN THE NECESSITY, OF FABULATION IN RECOUNTING ACTS OF GENOCIDAL VIOLENCE THAT STRAIN OR DEFY STRAIGHTFORWARD REPRESENTATION, ESPECIALLY IN CASES WHEN THE EXISTING RULE OF LAW DOES NOT RISE TO THE DEMANDS FOR JUSTICE.
28	AS ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION BRINGS A SERIES OF PROBLEMS TO SOCIETY AND RESIDENTIAL LIVES, HOW TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE AIR POLLUTION AND CONTROL CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE BECOME URGENT PROBLEMS. SINCE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AFFECTING AIR QUALITY, WE EVALUATED THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM BASED ON CROSS-COUNTRY PANEL DATA FROM 2000 TO 2016. WE FIND THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES PM2.5, AND THIS POLLUTION REDUCTION EFFECT IS OBVIOUS IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND IN COUNTRIES WITH COMMON LAWS. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THE COMPONENTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION, THE DEGREE OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION CONTROL, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS HAVE SIGNIFICANT EMISSION REDUCTION EFFECTS. TO EXPLORE HOW INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AFFECTS AIR POLLUTION, WE PERFORM MECHANISM ANALYSIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, FOREIGN TRADE, AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS. WE FURTHER VERIFY THREE ENVIRONMENTAL PROPOSITIONS INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE, THE POLLUTION PARADISE HYPOTHESIS, AND PORTER HYPOTHESIS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE POLLUTION REDUCTION EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN BE MEDIATED BY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RATE, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE EXISTS, THE POLLUTION PARADISE HYPOTHESIS IS VALIDATED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOWER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY LEVEL, AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN ACHIEVE THE PORTER EFFECT THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS.
29	IN SPITE OF RECENT ADVANCES IN THE LITERATURE, THERE ARE STILL FEWER EMPIRICAL WORKS, EMBRACING DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD, THAT ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF POPULIST GOVERNMENTS ON THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. THIS PAPER, WHICH COVERS 33 COUNTRIES FROM FIVE WORLD REGIONS FROM 1996 UNTIL 2019, INTENDS TO FILL THIS GAP. BY USING DIFFERENT STATISTICAL METHODS, OUR DATA SHOW THAT PERIODS UNDER POPULIST GOVERNMENTS IN POWER HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GOVERNANCE QUALITY MEASURED BY THE WGI DATA SET. FOR EACH OF THE SIX DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE, HOWEVER, (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) WE DETECT EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, EXPLORING THE DATA BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION AND TYPES OF POPULISM (EXCLUSIVE, NEOLIBERAL AND INCLUSIVE), CRUCIALLY REFINES OUR FINDINGS, SHOWING A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCES AND REVEALING THAT SIMILAR TYPES OF POPULISM OPERATE IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN SEPARATE GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXTS. THESE VARIATIONS ARE EXPLAINED BOTH BY THE DIFFICULTY OF DEFINING SLIPPERY CONCEPTS, AND APPLYING THEM CONSISTENTLY TO HISTORICAL CASES, AND BY PARTICULAR TRAITS AND HISTORICAL OCCURRENCES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP WE ANALYZE. THROUGH DIFFERENT FIXED REGRESSION MODELS, FINALLY, WE CONTROL FOR A SERIES OF POTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING FACTORS AND FIND THAT OUR HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED.
30	AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY AND DIVERTED FUNDS TO BUILD A WALL ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER, SEVERAL LITIGANTS CHALLENGED HIS ACTION AS ULTRA VIRES, OR BEYOND HIS CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY AUTHORITY. THE LITIGANTS ASSERTED ABSTRACT EQUITABLE RIGHTS OF ACTION, IMPLIED IN FEDERAL COURTS' EQUITABLE POWERS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS LEFT UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH AN IMPLIED EQUITABLE ACTION FOR STATUTORY VIOLATIONS BY FEDERAL OFFICIALS EXISTS. MANY JUDGES AND SCHOLARS RECOGNIZE IT AS PART OF THE COURT'S LONGSTANDING EQUITABLE TRADITION AND THE COMMON LAW HERITAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA). OTHERS MAINTAIN THAT THE APA IS EXCLUSIVE AND FORECLOSES AN IMPLIED ACTION THAT DOES NOT ADHERE TO ITS STATUTORY STRICTURES. THIS NOTE EXPLORES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE COURT'S MODERN IMPLIED RIGHT OF ACTION JURISPRUDENCE AND THE LONG TRADITION OF RECOGNIZING "NONSTATUTORY" REVIEW IN OFFICER SUITS. IT ARGUES THAT DESPITE THE COURT'S RETREAT FROM IMPLIED RIGHTS, NON-APA EQUITABLE REVIEW IS NOT PRECLUDED BY THE APA. RATHER, STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS APPLIED TO APA RIGHTS OF ACTION SHOULD ONLY APPLY TO IMPLIED EQUITABLE CLAIMS WHERE THEY REFLECT REQUIREMENTS THAT PREVIOUSLY EXISTED AT COMMON LAW. SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING VINDICATES THE APA'S COMMON LAW ORIGINS AND UPHOLDS IMPORTANT RULE OF LAW VALUES.
31	POLITICAL IDEOLOGY HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH COOPERATION AND NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM (I.E. GREATER COOPERATION WITH MEMBERS OF ONE'S NATION), WITH LIBERALS THOUGHT TO HAVE MORE COOPERATION WITH STRANGERS AND LESS NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM, COMPARED TO CONSERVATIVES. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS FINDINGS ARE LIMITED TO FEW-AND PREDOMINANTLY WESTERN-NATIONS. HERE, WE PRESENT A LARGE-SCALE CROSS-SOCIETAL EXPERIMENT THAT CAN TEST HYPOTHESES ON THE RELATION BETWEEN POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, COOPERATION AND NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM AROUND THE GLOBE. TO DO SO, WE RECRUITED 18 411 PARTICIPANTS FROM 42 NATIONS. PARTICIPANTS MADE DECISIONS IN A PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME, AND WE MANIPULATED THE NATIONALITY OF THEIR INTERACTION PARTNER (NATIONAL INGROUP MEMBER, NATIONAL OUTGROUP MEMBER OR UNIDENTIFIED STRANGER). WE FOUND THAT LIBERALS, COMPARED TO CONSERVATIVES, DISPLAYED SLIGHTLY GREATER COOPERATION, TRUST IN OTHERS AND GREATER IDENTIFICATION WITH THE WORLD AS A WHOLE. CONSERVATIVES, HOWEVER, IDENTIFIED MORE STRONGLY WITH THEIR OWN NATION AND DISPLAYED SLIGHTLY GREATER NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM IN COOPERATION. IMPORTANTLY, THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR WAS SIGNIFICANT IN NATIONS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER WEALTH, STRONGER RULE OF LAW AND BETTER GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND COOPERATION. THIS ARTICLE IS PART OF THE THEME ISSUE 'THE POLITICAL BRAIN: NEUROCOGNITIVE AND COMPUTATIONAL MECHANISMS'.
32	AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND CHINA'S REGULARIZED PANDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL, LEADING LEGAL SCHOLARS FROM CHINA, NORTH AMERICA, AND EURASIA PARTICIPATED IN THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION UNDER PANDEMIC PREVENTION AND CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS ON THE NORMATIVE NECESSITY AND PRACTICAL RELEVANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN JUSTIFYING THEIR CURRENT GOVERNMENTS' ANTI-PANDEMIC MEASURES. FOCUSING ON PANDEMIC-RELATED HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS AND RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES IN GLOBAL CONTEXTS, THIS ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE PARTICIPATING SCHOLARS' SPEECHES THROUGH THE INTEGRATED LENS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE JURISPRUDENCE OF HEALTH LAW IN THE COVID-19 CONTAINMENT PHASE. SPEECHES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SIX TOPICAL DIMENSIONS, INVOLVING NORMATIVE UTILITY, GOVERNANCE LOGIC, REASONABLE LIMITS, CONSTITUTIONAL CRITERIA, VIABLE APPROACHES, AND POST-PANDEMIC CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY. TO PROVIDE A MORE POLICY-RELEVANT AND THEORETICALLY SOUND FRAMEWORK FOR A COMMUNITY OF COMMON HEALTH FOR MANKIND, THIS ARTICLE SUCCINCTLY CONCLUDES WITH A SERIES OF OVERLAPPING CONSENSUS ON THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE PANDEMIC. THIS CONSENSUS, TENTATIVELY NAMED THE "RENMIN HUMAN RIGHTS CONSENSUS," BUILDS ON FIVE INTERRELATED ELEMENTS AND GENERATES FIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ASSERTIONS AND A SERIES OF SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH LAW.
33	THE 16TH-CENTURY FRENCH HUMANIST WRITER ETIENNE DE LA BOETIE HAS NOT OFTEN BEEN CONSIDERED IN LITERATURE ON REPUBLICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT, DESPITE HIS FAMOUS ESSAY, DISCOURS DE LA SERVITUDE VOLONTAIRE, DISPLAYING A NUMBER OF CLEAR REPUBLICAN TROPES AND THEMES, BEING LARGELY CONCERNED WITH THE PROBLEM OF ARBITRARY POWER EMBODIED IN THE FIGURE OF THE TYRANT. YET, 1 ARGUE THAT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LA BOETIE'S TEXT IS IN HIS RADICAL CONCEPT OF VOLUNTARY SERVITUDE AND THE WAY IT ADDS A NEW DIMENSION TO THE NEO-REPUBLICAN THEORY OF LIBERTY AS NON-DOMINATION. THE PROBLEM OF SELF-DOMINATION OR WILFUL OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY IS A FORM OF IDEOLOGICAL DOMINATION THAT PETTIT'S UNDERSTANDING OF ARBITRARY POWER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN AGENTS DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR. FURTHERMORE, LA BOETIE SHOWS THAT FREEDOM IS AN ONTOLOGICAL CONDITION AND IS REALISED NOT - OR NOT ENTIRELY - THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW AS THE GUARANTEE AGAINST ARBITRARINESS, AS NEO-REPUBLICANS ADVOCATE, BUT RATHER THROUGH ACTS OF SELF-EMANCIPATION AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. HERE I UNDERSTAND LA BOETIE'S THINKING IN TERMS OF A CERTAIN ANARCHO-REPUBLICANISM IN WHICH THE PROMOTION OF FREEDOM DEPENDS NOT SO MUCH ON INSTITUTIONS, AS PETTIT SUGGESTS, BUT RATHER ON AUTONOMOUS RELATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP, LOVE AND SOLIDARITY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.
34	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR OR THE COURT) TO BE THAT OF A GUARDIAN OF DISCOURSE WOULD RESPECT LEGITIMATE DISAGREEMENT AMONG PLURALIST DEMOCRACIES, WHILE ENABLING THE COURT TO SAFEGUARD HUMAN RIGHTS IN A MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE WAY. FROM THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR OR THE CONVENTION) AND THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE, THREE BASIC STANDARDS OF REVIEW CAN BE DISTILLED: FIRST, WHEREVER THE CONVENTION'S REQUIREMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY CONCRETE, THE COURT HOLDS CONTRACTING STATES TO WELL-ESTABLISHED STANDARDS. SECOND, WHEN APPLYING BROAD, ABSTRACT AND RELATIVE CONVENTION RIGHTS, THE COURT SAFEGUARDS THE PRACTICAL RATIONALITY OF A DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING DISCOURSE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW - A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW STANDARD THAT IS INFLUENCED BY PROCEDURAL FACTORS. THIRD, THE COURT ALSO NEEDS TO CHECK THE FACTS UNDERLYING THE CASE, IN ORDER TO RENDER ITS CONTROL EFFECTIVE. BY SETTING ''SOFT' PRECEDENT IN THE FORM OF FACTORS THAT GUIDE FUTURE DECISION-MAKING WITHOUT ENTIRELY PREJUDGING IT, AND BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SECOND-ORDER REASONS CONCERNING ITS LEGITIMACY TO INTERVENE, THE COURT IS ACTING AS A SECOND PLAYER IN STATES' DECISION-MAKING DISCOURSE. ITS TASK IS NOT TO REPLACE THE INSTITUTIONS ORIGINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE DECISION, BUT TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONFORM TO THEIR OWN ROLE.
35	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW PARAMILITARIES AND ALLIED COMPANIES PUT GRASSROOTS DEVELOPMENT DISCOURSES OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND SUBSIDIARITY, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, AND ETHNIC EMPOWERMENT TO WORK IN EXECUTING AND RATIFYING THEIR MASSIVE LAND GRAB IN NORTHWEST COLOMBIA. MORE THAN A CASE OF TRYING TO "WHITEWASH" THEIR MALFEASANCE WITH FASHIONABLE AND POLITICALLY CORRECT DEVELOPMENT-SPEAK, I ARGUE THAT THE GRASSROOTS DEVELOPMENT APPARATUS ITS DISCOURSES, INSTITUTIONAL FORMS, AND PRACTICES BECAME UTTERLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE ILLEGAL LAND SEIZURES. MOREOVER, WHEN OPERATING ALONGSIDE PRACTICES OF LAND PARCELIZATION, ITERATIVE TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCERS' COOPERATIVES, AND THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES, GRASSROOTS DEVELOPMENT FACILITATED WHAT COULD BE CALLED "LAND LAUNDERING." IN THE PROCESS, GRASSROOTS DEVELOPMENT BECAME A CONDUIT FOR PARAMILITARY-BACKED STATE FORMATION IN WHICH PROJECTS OF LIBERAL GOVERNANCE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPERATIVES OF INSTITUTION BUILDING, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW BECAME PERVERSELY COMPATIBLE WITH THE REGION'S ECONOMIES OF VIOLENCE. WITH THE WORLD BANK INCREASINGLY CONCERNED OVER THE CONFLATION OF FRAGILE STATES, VIOLENT CONFLICT, AND ALARMING LAND GRABS, THIS ARTICLE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE GRASSROOTS SOLUTIONS CURRENTLY BEING ENDORSED BY THE BANK CAN IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY FACILITATE DISPOSSESSION, ILLICIT ECONOMIES, AND VIOLENT POLITICAL PROJECTS. THE WAY PARAMILITARIES HARNESSED GRASSROOTS DEVELOPMENT ALSO HAS CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR DEBATES ABOUT POST-DEVELOPMENT. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
36	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO OUTLINE A POLITICAL THEORY OF CRIMINAL LAW, THAT IS, A THEORY THAT DOES NOT RELY ON ANY CONTROVERSIAL MORAL VIEW ON FAULT AND PUNISHMENT. THE ARGUMENT IS BASED LARGELY ON JOHN RAWLS'S WORK BUT ALSO ADDRESSES SOME INCONSISTENCIES REGARDING CRIME AND PUNISHMENT THEREIN. THE PAPER WILL MAKE A CASE FOR A MIXED THEORY OF CRIMINAL LAW AND PUNISHMENT ALONG THE FOLLOWING LINES: THE FAIR TERMS OF SOCIAL COOPERATION GENERATE DUTIES FOR THE VIOLATION OF WHICH ONE CAN BE HELD PROPERLY RESPONSIBLE. HOWEVER, NOTHING IN THIS DETERMINES WHAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY SEEKING MEASURE MAY BE OR ITS INTENSITY. THESE ARE MATTERS OF APPROPRIATENESS TO BE DETERMINED IN TERMS OF THE ASSURANCE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN A WELL-ORDERED SOCIETY AND THE LONG-TERM STABILITY OF SOCIAL COOPERATION. CRIMINALIZATION AND PUNISHMENT ARE CONTINGENT, HISTORICALLY QUALIFIED MEANS OF ACHIEVING STABILITY AND ASSURANCE, SERVING ONLY AS LAST RESORT. ALTHOUGH THE INSTITUTION OF PUNISHMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH STEM DIRECTLY FROM THE LIBERTY PRINCIPLE, QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE INTENSITY OF PUNISHMENT OR THE PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN OFFENSES AND PENALTIES DEPEND ON THE PROPER WORKINGS OF THE UTILITARIAN CALCULUS IN COMBINATION WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING.
37	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ('COURT') IN RESOLVING CURRENT AND EMERGING TERRITORIAL DISPUTES IN AFRICA. THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE COURT AS THE PRINCIPAL JUDICIAL ORGAN OF THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS ('UN CHARTER') HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RESOLVING TERRITORIAL DISPUTES ON THE CONTINENT. AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS DISPUTES THE COURT HAS ADDRESSED IN THE PAST DEMONSTRATES THE UNIQUE ROLE AND CAPABILITY OF THE COURT TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL DISPUTES OF A SIMILAR NATURE. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT THE DECISION BY SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO VOLUNTARILY SUBMIT THEIR DISPUTES TO THE COURT AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THOSE NATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH REFERRALS DEMONSTRATES THE GROWING BELIEF AMONG THESE COUNTRIES IN THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF THE COURT IN FURTHERING THE PRINCIPLES AND GOALS REFLECTED IN THE UN CHARTER. ON THE BASIS OF THIS POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THE COURT, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT CURRENT AND POTENTIAL TERRITORIAL DISPUTES, SUCH AS THOSE IN ETHIOPIA AND SUDAN, SHOULD BE REFERRED TO THE COURT FOR DETERMINATION. THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE COURT IN SUCH DISPUTES WILL NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN AFRICA BUT WILL ALSO ENHANCE THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW BY ENCOURAGING COUNTRIES TO RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTES PEACEFULLY.
38	THE SOCIAL ORIGINS OF LAW ARE AN OBJECTIVE FACTOR, WHICH ENCOURAGES EXPERTS AND LAYMEN ALIKE TO ENGAGE IN A LEGAL DISCOURSE. THE RELEVANCE OF LEGAL REGULATION PUTS THE SOCIETY UNDER AN ILLUSION THAT LEGAL DISCOURSE IS EASY AND EVERYBODY COULD BE A PART OF IT BY VIRTUE OF USING COMMON SENSE ALONE. LEGAL DISCOURSE, HOWEVER, IS NOT LESS COMPLEX THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH DISCOURSE. AT ITS HEART LIES AN EFFORT TO PEER INTO THE PROBLEM IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. APART FROM ITS RELATION TO OTHER FIELDS, LEGAL DISCOURSE IS HEAVILY DOMINATED BY THE LEGAL SUBSTANCE. LEGAL DISCOURSE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE USAGE OF A UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FILLED WITH LEGAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIAL TERMINOLOGY AND REASONED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC THEORIES. DIDACTICS, I.E. THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH LEGAL REGULATION AND DOCTRINE, ARE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE QUALITY OF A LEGAL DISCOURSE. EFFORTS TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF DIDACTICS IN A 'LEGAL' DISCOURSE LEAD TO A SIMULATED SCIENCE (I. BOUDRILLARD). THIS LEADS TO DISINFORMATION RATHER THAT INFORMATION FOR THE SOCIETY. SIMULATION OF A LEGAL DISCOURSE MAKES LAW APPEAR AS SOMETHING INTANGIBLE AND NEARLY METAPHYSICAL. SUCH DISCOURSES DECREASE THE VALUE OF LAW IN THE SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES A UTOPIA RATHER THAN A REALITY OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
39	WE EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOTING RIGHTS AND TAXATION IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND AND FRANCE. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT VOTING WAS A WEALTH-ENHANCING INSTITUTION FORMED BY THE RULER IN ORDER TO FACILITATE PROFITABLE JOINT PROJECTS WITH SUBJECTS. WE PREDICT WHEN VOTING RIGHTS AND TAX PAYMENTS WILL BE LINKED TO EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS TO THE PROJECTS INDUCING THEM, AND WHEN THEY WILL BECOME SEPARATED. WE CLASSIFY TAXES INTO THREE TYPES: CUSTOMARY, CONSENSUAL AND ARBITRARY. CUSTOMARY TAXES THAT DID. NOT REQUIRE VOTING WERE DOMINANT IN BOTH COUNTRIES IN THE EARLY MEDIEVAL PERIOD. THESE PAYMENTS, FIXED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES, WERE NOT WELL SUITED FOR FUNDING NEW, LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS. CONSENSUAL TAXATION, IN WHICH VOTING FIGHTS AND TAX PAYMENTS WERE TIGHTLY LINKED, WAS USED TO FINANCE NEW, LARGE-SCALE COLLECTIVE PROJECTS IN BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE. STRONG RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO - PRODUCE SUCH TAXES. IN ENGLAND, WHERE SECURITY OF RULE REMAINED HIGH, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAX PAYMENTS AND VOTING RIGHTS WAS MAINTAINED. IN FRANCE, AN INCREASE IN THE INSECURITY OF RULE, AND THE ACCOMPANYING WEAKENING OF VOTING INSTITUTIONS, PRODUCED A SHIFT TO ARBITRARY TAXATION AND A DISJUNCTION BETWEEN TAX PAYMENTS AND VOTING RIGHTS. THESE OBSERVATIONS, AS WELL AS MANY OF THE DETAILS WE CONSIDER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF OUR MODEL.
40	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ARGUABLY AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CRISES CAN LEAD TO. IT SHOWS THAT, WHILE CRISES CAN TEAR AT A COMMUNITY'S LEGAL FABRIC, THEY CAN ALSO REVEAL ITS CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS AND THE PREMISSES LYING AT ITS CORE. OVERCOMING CRISES, IN TURN, INVOLVES NOT ONLY DEPLOYING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS BUT ALSO DRAWING THE FULLER CONSEQUENCES OF ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE PURPORTS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT RECENT CRISES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE OCCURRED IN PARALLEL WITH STRONGER AFFIRMATION BEING GIVEN TO WHAT MAY BE VIEWED AS AN EMERGING EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC ORDER. BEYOND ASKING HOW IT WOULD BE BEST QUALIFIED, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE NEW DYNAMICS THAT ARE INVOLVED HERE. THE NOTION OF PUBLIC ORDER HAS OFTEN BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DOMESTIC CAVEATS OR EXCEPTIONS TO FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS OR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROVIDED FOR IN EUROPEAN UNION LAW, YET ONE CAN SEE IN THE RECENT CASE-LAW A DIFFERENT KIND OF RECOGNITION BEING GIVEN TO THIS NOTION IN THE SHAPING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION LEGAL ORDER. THE COURT HAS RECALLED THAT THE UPHOLDING OF UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND COMMON VALUES, UPON WHICH THE UNION IS BASED, AS WELL AS THE MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN MEMBER STATES WHICH CHARACTERISES THE UNION ARE NECESSARY CONDITIONS OF THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF EXISTING EUROPEAN UNION NORMS. IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIREMENT OF AVOIDING DISRUPTION TO WHAT EUROPEAN UNION LAW REGARDS AS ITS PREMISSES, SUCH VALUES AND PRINCIPLES ARE INCREASINGLY TAKING ON A MORE POSITIVE ROLE AND HAVE THEMSELVES BECOME THE SOURCE OF AUTONOMOUS REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IN THIS SENSE THAT ONE COULD OBSERVE, IN THESE DYNAMICS, THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC ORDER.
41	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW INTERPRETATION THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINT MODEL OF THE DUTY THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT IMPOSES ON THE COURTS TO GIVE HORIZONTAL EFFECT TO EUROPEAN CONVENTION RIGHTS THROUGH THE COMMON LAW. THE MODEL REQUIRES COURTS TO DEVELOP THE COMMON LAW COMPATIBLY WITH THE CONVENTION, BUT ONLY WHERE COMPATIBILITY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT. WE ARGUE THAT MODELS REQUIRING MORE THAN INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT ARE UNSUSTAINABLE; THAT DEEP CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS COMPEL THE CONSTRAINT OF INCREMENTALISM, WHICH IS PRESERVED UNDER THE HRA; AND THAT BY VIRTUE OF SECTION 2 OF THE HRA, CONVENTION RIGHTS FUNCTION AS PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN HARD-EDGED RIGHTS IN THIS CONTEXT. THIS FURTHER UNDERMINES THE IDEA THAT THE COURTS MUST STRICTLY APPLY CONVENTION RIGHTS AND CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY NON-CONVENTION FACTORS. THE FINAL SECTION EXPLORES THE NATURE OF INCREMENTALISM IN THIS CONTEXT AND THE IMPACT OF THE MODEL ON THE DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL PRECEDENT.
42	THE CASE-LAW ON ARTICLE 18 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN EVOLVING RECENTLY IN A DRAMATIC FASHION. THIS EVOLUTION, WHICH SHAPED A NEW DOCTRINE ON THE MISUSE OF POWER, FOCUSES ON THE CRIMINALISATION OF DISSENT WITHIN A STATE WHERE UNDEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES ARISE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO HIGHLIGHT THESE UNDEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES AND DEMONSTRATE THAT ARTICLE 18 ECHR ADDRESSES THE SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES IN THE BALANCE OF POWERS WITHIN A STATE. A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 18 ECHR OCCURS WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENTMALE FIDETRIES TO ERODE THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMICCONTRE-POUVOIRSWITHIN A STATE AND WHEN THE INSTITUTIONALCONTRE-POUVOIRS, NAMELY THE JUDICIAL AND THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, FAIL TO AVERT THIS EROSION.
43	US UNIVERSITIES ARE LEADING THE WAY IN TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSING. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE PRACTICE OF LICENSING AT THE US UNIVERSITIES, AS WELL AS THE MAIN DIRECTIONS AND TASKS OF TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND. UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTERS CAN IMPLEMENT STEPS TO IMPROVE THEIR TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION AND LICENSING NEGOTIATION BY USING SOLID ANALYTICAL MODELS. IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS, WE SUGGEST AND DESCRIBE A GAME-THEORETIC MODEL TO ANALYZE, UNDERSTAND, AND ANTICIPATE THE BEHAVIORAL PROFILES OF INVENTORS, ENTREPRENEURS, AND INNOVATORS ON A DYNAMIC INTERACTIVE BASIS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A UNIVERSITY OR RESEARCH CENTER LINKAGES WITH THE MARKET (OF THE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEM) IN PURSUIT OF DESIGNING AN OPTIMAL (OR FEASIBLY SUB-OPTIMAL) LICENSING CONTRACT.
44	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOURISM ACTIVITIES AND HOUSE PRICES (HP) IN FIRST-TIER CITIES OF CHINA (BEIJING, SHANGHAI AND GUANGZHOU) USING THE WAVELET TRANSFORM CONTEXT STRUCTURES. THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNIQUE ALLOWS THE DECOMPOSITION OF TIME-SERIES AT DIFFERENT TIME FREQUENCIES. IN THIS WORK, WE USED CONTINUOUS WAVELETS, WAVELET COHERENCE AND WAVELET PHASE DIFFERENCE BASED ON GRANGER CAUSALITY ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOURISM ACTIVITIES AND HP. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS GENERALLY POSITIVE BUT CHANGES OVER TIME, DISPLAYING LOW TO HIGH FREQUENCY CYCLES. THERE IS A UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSAL INFLUENCE OF HP ON TOURISM ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY CHANGES WHEN HP CO-MOVES WITH TOURISM. ACCORDINGLY, IT CAN BE RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INCREASES AND PROMOTES TOURISM DEMAND AND FURTHER PROVIDES AND NURTURES THE EXPANSION OF TOURISM SUPPLY.
45	FROM THE MID-1890S, HABSBURG AUSTRIA BEGAN TO FOLLOW EUROPEAN TRENDS AND EXPERIENCED A GRADUAL DEMOCRATIZATION OF VOTING RIGHTS, WHICH INVOLVED NOT ONLY AN EXPANSION OF THE ELECTORATE BUT ALSO AN INNOVATION OF PROCEDURES THAT ATTEMPTED TO MODERNIZE ELECTIONS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE ARTICLE CALLS FOR A MORE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF VOTING PRACTICES AND ATTEMPTS TO POINT AT SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE THUS FAR RECEIVED INSUFFICIENT ANALYSIS. THESE INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE OCCASIONAL MASSIVE VIOLENT CONFLICTS AT ELECTIONS THAT COULD ACCOMPANY DEMOCRATIZATION UNTIL WORLD WAR I BUT ALSO THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN AS VOTERS AT LOCAL AND DIET ELECTIONS AND THE GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF POLLING BOOTHS. MEASURES SUCH AS ALLOWING SINGLE WOMEN TO CAST THEIR VOTE PERSONALLY IN A FEW CROWNLANDS OR ATTEMPTING TO GUARD THE SECRECY OF THE VOTE SUGGEST THE LEVEL OF EXPERIMENTATION IN THIS PERIOD. THE STATE'S OBJECTIVE OF ORDERLY, "MODERN" ELECTIONS IS PARTICULARLY CALLED INTO QUESTION WHEN WE CONSIDER THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOVERNMENT AGENTS, INCLUDING POLICEMEN AND THE ARMY, WERE INVOLVED IN ELECTION CONFLICTS THAT RESULTED IN FRAUD AND SOMETIMES BLOODSHED.
46	OVER THE YEARS, DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE OBLIGED THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT TO DECLARE SEVERAL TIMES A STATE OF EMERGENCY AS WELL AS TO ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMED FORCES IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT CONSIDERABLE DISTURBANCES OF THE PUBLIC ORDER. THESE MEASURES ARE AUTHORIZED BY THE CONSTITUTION CONCEIVING THEM AS DETERMINED, LIMITED AND TARGETED AT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE PUBLIC ORDER IN A WAY COMPATIBLE WITH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES. NONETHELESS, IN PRACTICE EXCESSES OF THE ARMED FORCES AND PERMANENT VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS ARE CLAIMED. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO OFFER SOME INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PREVENTION OF SUCH EXCESSES AND RIGHTS' VIOLATIONS, AS WELL AS FOR THE DEFINITION OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE MINISTERS IN THOSE CASES, BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY, AND, AS THE CASE MAY BE, A MILITARY INTERVENTION DO NOT INVOLVE A SUSPENSION NEITHER OF THE CONSTITUTION NOR OF THE RULE-OF-LAW-STATE AND OF THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES AND THEIR GUARANTEES. FURTHERMORE, THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT INVOLVE ARBITRARINESS, DO NOT AUTHORIZE EVERY MEASURE AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THE FAILURE OF THE STATE TO FULFIL ITS OBLIGATIONS TO OBSERVE AND GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZENS. BESIDES, THE CONSTITUTION GRANTS NO SPECIAL COMPETENCE, ADJUDICATION OR PREROGATIVE TO THE ARMED FORCES. ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTION AUTHORIZES THE SUSPENSION OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF RIGHTS, THIS DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY ARBITRARY ACTS AND VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED SUSPENSION. IN THIS CASE THE ARMED FORCES MERELY ASSUME A TASK (PUBLIC ORDER) WHICH DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE MILITARIZATION OF THE PUBLIC ORDER BUT MERELY THE PERFORMANCE OF SOME FUNCTIONS BY THE ARMED FORCES DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL POLICE FORCES TO PERFORM THESE TASKS BY REASON OF GRAVE CIRCUMSTANCES. DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND REQUIRING THE INTERVENTION OF THE ARMED FORCES, THE PRESIDENT AND THE MINISTERS SHALL, BESIDES THE PURSUIT OF REESTABLISHMENT OF THE PUBLIC ORDER, UNDERTAKE THE FUNCTION OF GUARANTORS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, THE RULE-OF-LAW-STATE, THE FRAMEWORK OF RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. THIS FUNCTION SHALL BE REFLECTED IN ALL ITS PRESIDENTIAL ACTS AS CHEF SUPREME OF THE FFAA AND IN THE ACTS OF THE MINISTERS AS HEADS OF THEIR CORRESPONDING SECTORS. THUS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED COMPETENCIES INVOLVES ALSO RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH COULD BE PROVOKED BY ACTS OF THE ARMED FORCES CONTROLLING THE INTERNAL ORDER WHEN THEY SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATE RIGHTS. THE LIABILITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT EXISTS EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE NOT ORDERED THE COMMITMENT OF THOSE VIOLATION ACTS BUT DO NOT TAKE THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO PREVENT THEM. FURTHERMORE, THE LIABILITY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED IN THE CASE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT COVER UP OR PERMIT THE IMPUNITY OF THOSE ACTS, IMPEDE OR HINDER THEIR INVESTIGATION OR THE ARRAIGNMENT OF THE ACCUSED BEFORE THE COURTS, THEIR PUNISHMENT OR THE COMPENSATION OF THE VICTIMS.
47	"PUBLIC INTEREST" STANDARDS IN STATUTORY DELEGATIONS TO AGENCIES REPRESENT THE GREATEST HOPES AND THE DARKEST FEARS OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARD PROVIDES A VESSEL FOR AGENCIES TO INFUSE POLICYMAKING WITH THE MORAL AND ETHICAL COMMITMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, REGULATION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST OPENS THE DOOR TO THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF TYRANNICAL STATE POWER. DESPITE THE LOFTY ASPIRATIONS AND OMINOUS WARNINGS ABOUT REGULATION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW AGENCIES ACTUALLY DECIDE WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHEN CHARGED BY STATUTE TO DO SO. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO MOVE BEYOND THE RHETORIC SURROUNDING REGULATION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST BY CONDUCTING A GROUNDED INQUIRY INTO HOW AGENCIES IMPLEMENT PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS IN THE STATUTES THEY ADMINISTER. USING DATA FROM AGENCY ADJUDICATIONS UNDER FOUR DIFFERENT STATUTORY SCHEMES DATING FROM THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT, THE STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW AGENCIES DEFINE THE PUBLIC INTEREST, WHETHER AGENCIES USE PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS WITH UNFETTERED DISCRETION BASED ON WHATEVER CRITERIA THEY WISH (AS SOME FEAR), AND WHETHER AGENCIES APPLY PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS IN WAYS THAT INFUSE POLICY MAKING WITH COMMON GOOD OR COMMUNITY VALUES (AS SOME HOPE). THE STUDY'S FINDINGS WILL SURPRISE MANY AND PLEASE FEW. FIRST, IT DEMONSTRATES THAT AGENCIES APPLYING STATUTORY PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS EXHIBIT RATIONAL AND PREDICTABLE PATTERNS THAT COMPORT WITH RULE-OF-LAW VALUES OF TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY. SECOND, THE STUDY FINDS THAT AGENCIES RARELY CONSIDER WHAT MIGHT BE CHARACTERIZED AS "COMMON GOOD" OR "COMMUNITY" VALUES IN THEIR PUBLIC INTEREST ANALYSES UNLESS SUCH CONSIDERATIONS ARE MANDATED BY STATUTE, AND THAT AGENCIES TEND TO DISCOUNT SUCH CONSIDERATIONS EVEN WHEN STATUTORILY REQUIRED. THIRD, IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST, THE STUDY REVEALS THAT IN MOST CONTEXTS STUDIED, ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS ARE THE MOST-RAISED AND MOST-ACCEPTED JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHY A PARTICULAR OUTCOME IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE STUDY MAKES THREE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCHOLARLY AND JURISPRUDENTIAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO REGULATE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. FIRST, IT PROVIDES A NOVEL DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF WHAT AGENCIES ACTUALLY DO WHEN AUTHORIZED TO REGULATE SOME FACET OF SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, EXTENDING IMPORTANT STRANDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SCHOLARSHIP ON BUREAUCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, PUBLIC UTILITY LAW, AND THE MEANING OF "PUBLICNESS." SECOND, IT DISPELS COMMON CONCERNS THAT REGULATION UNDER A BROAD PUBLIC INTEREST DELEGATION VIOLATES RULE-OF-LAW OR SEPARATION-OF-POWERS PRINCIPLES. THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED HERE PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT STATUTORY PUBLIC INTEREST STANDARDS DO NOT POSE NONDELEGATION PROBLEMS AND SUGGESTS A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYZING OTHER BROAD STATUTORY MANDATES LIKELY TO BE SUBJECTED TO NONDELEGATION CHALLENGES. THIRD, THE STUDY CASTS DOUBT ON THE WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY OF AGENCIES TO CHAMPION COMMON GOOD OR COMMUNITY VALUES EVEN UNDER CLEAR STATUTORY DIRECTION. THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW ADVOCATES OF VALUES-INFORMED ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING SHOULD APPROACH THEIR PROJECT.
48	PURPOSE OF REVIEW SUMMARY OF RESEARCH ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, WHICH MANIFEST THEMSELVES AS DISASTERS, FOR COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE AS WELL AS ON POLICY MEASURES TO MITIGATE SUCH NEGATIVE EFFECTS. RECENT FINDINGS A GROWING, BUT CONTESTED, MAJORITY OF STUDIES INDICATE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE OCCURRENCE, ESCALATION, AND PROLONGATION OF COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE IN THE WAKE OF DISASTERS. THE IDENTIFICATION OF CONDITIONS AND MECHANISMS, SOME OF WHICH INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF VIOLENCE AND SOME OF WHICH HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT, HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSITY OF OUTCOMES. THIS INCLUDES THE CONSEQUENCES OF POLITICAL AND HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTIONS PRIOR TO, DURING AND AFTER DISASTERS, WHICH CAN OVERLAY LOCAL PROCESSES. SUMMARY CONDITIONS AND MECHANISMS SHAPING THE LINK BETWEEN DISASTERS AND COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLICY INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY, OR CAN BE, TAKEN TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTREME EVENTS, INCREASING OR REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD AND LEVEL OF COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE.
49	ACCORDING TO VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE PROTOCOL ESTABLISHING THE AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS, THE COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE INTERPRETATION AND / OR APPLICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS RATIFIED BY THE STATES CONCERNED. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER, IN TERMS OF THOSE PROVISIONS, THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE (ACDEG) IS A RELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENT OVER WHICH THE COURT CAN EXERCISE ITS JURISDICTION. IT AIMS TO CONSIDER THE CONTOURS OF THE MAIN QUESTION POSED AND CLARIFY THE RELEVANT ASPECTS IN LIGHT NOT ONLY OF THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE BUT ALSO OF THE OVERALL LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE AFRICAN UNION. IN THIS REGARD, BEFORE DRAWING APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS, IT ADDRESSES THREE MAIN QUESTIONS. WHAT IS A HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENT? WHICH ELEMENTS IN THE ACDEG CLEARLY RELATE TO HUMAN RIGHTS? AND, WHAT IS THE COURT'S APPROACH ON THE ISSUE?
50	E-BIKES REGULATION IS A COMPREHENSIVE URBAN TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, WHICH CONNECTS ALL LINKS AND INVOLVES THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL INTERESTED PARTIES. IN BEIJING, THE E-BIKE GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM "PROHIBITION" TO "REGULATION", WHICH MAINLY CONCENTRATES ON THREE ASPECTS: PRODUCT QUALITY, REGISTRATION FOR LICENSE PLATES, AND MANAGEMENT OF NON-STANDARD VEHICLES. PRODUCT CATALOG IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDE DEMONSTRATING NATIONAL STANDARDS THAT CONNECT VARIOUS REGULATION MEANS: E-BIKES SHOULD BE QUALIFIED UNDER THE CATALOG; THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGES THE REGISTRATION OF ELECTRIC BICYCLES AND THE APPLICATION OF LICENSE PLATES THROUGH THE CATALOG. REGISTRATION AND LICENSE PLATES PROVIDE THE TRANSPORTATION POLICE WITH A MEANS TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE E-BIKES RUNNING ON THE ROAD. THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF NON-STANDARD-VEHICLES IS A BENEFICIAL ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THE PUBLIC'S WELL-BEING, GOVERNMENT'S POWER, AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.
51	OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA (OGD) HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES, BUT ITS UTILIZATION IS FAR FROM EXPECTATIONS. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO STUDY THE FACTORS AND MECHANISMS THAT AFFECT OPEN DATA UTILIZATION. DRAWING FROM THE RESOURCE COMPLEMENTARITY PERSPECTIVE OF THE RESOURCE-BASED THEORY, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE MODERATING EFFECT OF THE SIX DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE ON OPEN DATA QUALITY AND OPEN DATA UTILIZATION. THE MODEL IS EMPIRICALLY TESTED BY THE PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS) METHOD USING SAMPLE DATA FROM 115 COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FIVE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE (INCLUDING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) MODERATED THE RELATIONSHIP OF OPEN DATA QUALITY WITH OPEN DATA UTILIZATION IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF OPEN DATA QUALITY ON OPEN DATA UTILIZATION STILL HOLDS TRUE AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT GOVERNANCE, AS AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE TO PROMOTE OPEN DATA ACTIVITIES, CAN BETTER PROMOTE OPEN DATA UTILIZATION AND VALUE GENERATION WHEN COMBINED WITH OPEN DATA RESOURCES OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES. DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE LEVELS ARE AN IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY VARIABLE FOR THE LARGE DIFFERENCES OF OPEN DATA UTILIZATION AMONG COUNTRIES. IN OPEN DATA PRACTICE, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT ONLY IMPROVE OPEN DATA QUALITY, BUT ALSO IMPROVE THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE LEVEL TO PROVIDE COMPLEMENTARY RESOURCE SUPPORT FOR THE UTILIZATION AND VALUE GENERATION OF OPEN DATA IN THEIR COUNTRIES.
52	EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES (EUDS) ARE BINDING UPON MEMBER STATES AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE ACHIEVED, BUT LEAVE TO NATIONAL AUTHORITIES THE CHOICE OF FORM AND METHODS. THEREFORE, MEMBER STATES ADOPT AD HOC NATIONAL IMPLEMENTING MEASURES (NIMS) THAT MOSTLY REPRODUCE THE CONTENTS OF EUDS AND TRANSPOSE THEM INTO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. THIS WELL-KNOWN PROCESS IS DEFINED AS "LEGAL HARMONIZATION" AND CONSISTS OF THE GRADUAL, ALTHOUGH AMBIGUOUS, APPROXIMATION OF NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION. IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THIS PHENOMENON, WE COLLECT A LARGE AND UNIQUE DATASET COMPOSED OF EUROPEAN AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATIVE SOURCES, WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT TO AUTOMATICALLY PAIR EUDS AND THE CORRESPONDING NIMS, IN LIGHT OF THEIR SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. THE FIRST RESULTS SHOW THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROPOSED TASK TO DISCERN NIMS FROM NATIONAL LEGISLATION THAT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO IMPLEMENTING EUDS, THUS CONSTITUTING THE FOUNDATION FOR A SEMANTIC SEARCH ENGINE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EFFORT CAN PROMOTE FUTURE APPLICATIONS AND RESEARCH DIRECTIONS, WITH THE ULTIMATE AIM TO SUPPORT TRADITIONAL LEGAL METHODOLOGY, FACILITATE CITIZENS' ACCESS TO RIGHTS, SUPPORT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS, AND, MORE IN GENERAL, PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EUROPEAN UNION.

53	THE PRESENT STUDY DRAWS MOTIVATION FROM UNITED NATION SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (UNSDGS) AND ITS IMPACT BY 2030. TO THIS END, THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORED THE NEXUS BETWEEN ENERGY CONSUMPTION (SDG-7), CLIMATE ACTION (SDG-13), AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (SDG-8) WHILE CONTROLLING FOR ROLE OF GOVERNMENT APPARATUS SUCH AS LIKE VOICE OF ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IN A BALANCED PANEL OF 46 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) ECONOMIES FROM 1996 TO 2020. FOR A ROBUST STUDY, THE PRESENT STUDY LEVERAGES ON SECONDGENERATION ESTIMATOR SUCH AS CROSS-SECTIONAL SUR, TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARE (2SLS), 2SLS IS REFERRED TO AS THE SUPERIOR ESTIMATORS TO TRADITIONAL POOL OLS DUE TO ITS CAPABILITIES OF INCLUDING ENDOGENOUS REGRESSORS AND EFFICIENCY. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT ALL THE COEFFICIENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MOBILE SUBSCRIPTION (LNTI) ARE NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT 1% LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE (P-VALUE <0.01). THIS INDICATES THAT HIGHER (LOWER) MOBILE CELLULAR SUBSCRIPTIONS RESULTS IN THE REDUCTION (RISE) OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, IMPLYING THAT TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IN TERMS OF THE EXPANSION OF MOBILE CELLULAR SUBSCRIPTION HINDERS ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY IN SSA. CONCLUSIVELY, THE PRESENT STUDY PRESENTS INTERESTING OUTCOMES CONCERNING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, GOVERNANCE, AND SDGS GOAL 7 (CLEAN ENERGY) AND 13 (CLIMATE ACTION) IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN BLOCS. POLICY STRATEGIES ARE OUTLINED IN THE CONCLUDING SECTION.
54	GLOBAL HEALTH GOVERNANCE CONCERNS THE COLLECTIVE RESPONSES NEEDED WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY TO EFFECTIVELY TACKLE THE SHARED CHALLENGES ARISING IN AN INCREASINGLY CONNECTED WORLD. IT IS A TRUISM THAT PROMOTING A ROBUST HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL TO THE ATTAINMENT OF GOOD HEALTH AND WELLBEING. YET THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE - THE LAWS AND POLICIES THAT EMPOWER AND OBLIGATE AS WELL AS LIMIT GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ACTION CONCERNING HEALTH, HAS BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE MAINSTREAM LITERATURE. THIS IS BECAUSE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS FOCUSED MORE ON PHYSICAL STRUCTURES OF PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES SUCH AS CLINICS, HOSPITALS AND THE HUMAN RESOURCES THAT OPERATE THEM. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION LEGAL REGIMES SUCH AS THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON TOBACCO CONTROL (2003) AND THE REVISED INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS, HAVE IMPACTED ON HEALTH LAW AND POLICY IN NIGERIA. IT POSITS THAT THE VARIOUS CONVENTIONS AND REGULATIONS ADOPTED, WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY RATIFIED AND DECLARED APPLICABLE TO NIGERIA, HAD BEEN DOMESTICATED. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW HAS STYMIED THE MAXIMISATION OF THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH LEGAL REGIMES. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SHOULD DEVELOP A PROGRAMME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH LAW CAPACITY-BUILDING AND POLICY SURVEILLANCE TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS AND ORGANISED EFFORTS TO ASSIST MEMBER STATES INCLUDING NIGERIA TO STRENGTHEN THEIR LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
55	CONSIDERING THE NECESSITY OF INCREASING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION STATED IN THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL (EUROPEAN COMMISSION POLICY INITIATIVES ENVISAGING EUROPEAN UNION (EU) TO BECOME CLIMATE NEUTRAL BY 2050), THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO VALIDATE THE SO-CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) AND THE REVISED (OR RENEWABLE ENERGY) KUZNETS CURVE (RKC) IN TEN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN (CEE) COUNTRIES (REPRESENTED BY BULGARIA, CZECH REPUBLIC, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, LATVIA, LITHUANIA, POLAND, ROMANIA, SLOVAKIA, AND SLOVENIA) IN THE PERIOD FROM 1990 UNTIL 2019. CONDITIONED BY DATA AVAILABILITY, THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES ON GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS IS ASSESSED IN THE PERIOD 2002-2019.THE RESULTS BASED ON THE PANEL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (ARDL) MODELS INDICATED THE CONTRIBUTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN REDUCING POLLUTION AND THE ROLE OF LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN ENHANCING GHG EMISSIONS IN THE LONG RUN. MOREOVER, OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT DOMESTIC CREDIT TO PRIVATE SECTOR REDUCED POLLUTION IN THE LONG RUN ONLY IN THE PERIOD OF 2002-2019. IN ADDITION, SUCH FACTORS AS THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WERE THE GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE LONG RUN. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF OUR STUDY MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN SUPPORTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES IN THE EU COUNTRIES FOR ACHIEVING THEIR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL OBJECTIVES.(C) 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).
56	THE PAST TWO DECADES HAVE WITNESSED A HIGH NATIONAL IMPORTANCE TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION AROUND THE WORLD. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION ON POVERTY REDUCTION AND INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE WORLD, HIGH, MIDDLE, AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A NEW COMPOSITE FINANCIAL INCLUSION WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THREE DIMENSIONS FOR FINDING VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES AFFECTING THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR 122 ECONOMIES, INCLUDING 32 FROM HIGH-INCOME, 38 FROM UPPER MIDDLE INCOME, 38 FROM LOWER MIDDLE INCOME, AND 14 FROM LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. THEN THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION, ON POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY, FOR THE WORLD AND THEN FOR HIGH, MIDDLE, AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES WAS INVESTIGATED. THE ESTIMATES REVEAL THAT RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR THE WORLD, HIGH, MIDDLE, AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. BUT AGE DEPENDENCY RATIO INFLUENCES THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION ONLY FOR OUR FULL SAMPLE. HOWEVER, POPULATION DENSITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES FINANCIAL INCLUSION JUST IN THE FULL SAMPLE AND UPPER MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. EDUCATION COMPLETION IMPACTS SIGNIFICANTLY FINANCIAL INCLUSION JUST IN UPPER MIDDLE INCOME. WHILE LITERACY HAS A HIGHER IMPACT ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION IS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH LOWER POVERTY FOR THE FULL SAMPLE. THE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND INCOME INEQUALITY HAS BEEN FOUND FOR HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND LOWER-MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES.
57	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS AND THE MEMBER STATES WITH REGARD TO STATE AID CONTROL. THE MANDATE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION INCLUDES THE MAINTENANCE AND STRENGTHENING OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, AND AS SUCH IT MAY DISCIPLINE ANY MEMBER STATES THAT UNDERMINE THE SINGLE MARKET. RELYING ON AN ORIGINAL DATABASE COVERING ALL STATE AID APPLICATIONS WITH RULINGS BETWEEN 2000 AND 2017, WE SHOW THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, THE COMMISSION TENDS TO REJECT PROGRAMS ORIGINATING FROM COUNTRIES THAT ARE RESISTANT TO EU INTEGRATION, WHICH IS PROXIED BY THE TRANSPOSITION DEFICIT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN FIRMS OR NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS APPEAL THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMMISSION, THE REVERSAL OF THE COMMISSION'S REJECTION DECISIONS BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE TRANSPOSITION DEFICIT. THIS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT WHILE THE COMMISSION IS BIASED AGAINST COUNTRIES WITH GREATER RESISTANCE TO INTEGRATION, THE COURT CORRECTS THIS BIAS SINCE ITS MANDATE IS TO GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. WE ARGUE THAT THESE REVEALED POLICY PREFERENCES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THESE TWO BODIES ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN THEIR LEGITIMACY BY MAKING DECISIONS IN LINE WITH THEIR MANDATES. MOREOVER, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWIN PURSUITS OF LEGITIMACY REINFORCES THE OVERALL LEGITIMACY OF THE UNION, SUGGESTING ANOTHER DRIVER OF EVOLUTION IN AN EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH OF INSTITUTIONS.
58	THE PAPER SHOWS THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF ETHICS IN THE ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT IS THE COORDINATION OF ALL ELEMENTS RELATED TO THE MORAL LIFE OF A UNIVERSITY. THE LAST DECADES HAVE INSISTENTLY IMPOSED ON PUBLIC AWARENESS THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ETHICAL DIMENSION OF THE LIFE OF UNIVERSITIES. ETHICAL CODES, ETHICS COMMITTEES, ETHICAL AUDITS, ETHICAL EDUCATION OF STAFF, TECHNIQUES TO CREATE AN INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE OF A MORAL NATURE HAVE ALL BECOME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD. "INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ETHICS" IN ACADEMIA IS A NEW REALITY FOR WHICH WE MUST BE PREPARED. THE UNIVERSITY IS AN INSTITUTION WHOSE GOALS, VALID FOR EACH OF ITS MEMBERS, INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL AFFIRMATION, THE EVOLUTION OF KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH IN THE CONDITIONS OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE UNIVERSITY RESPECTS THE DIGNITY OF EACH OF ITS MEMBERS AND PROMOTES ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ON ETHICAL PRINCIPLES. ITS MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY OF SOCIETY. WE THINK THAT THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT UNIVERSITIES PROMOTE IN PARTICULAR, AND WHOSE ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT IS SOUGHT TO ENSURE, ARE: ACADEMIC FREEDOM, PERSONAL AUTONOMY, JUSTICE AND EQUITY, MERIT, PROFESSIONALISM, HONESTY AND INTELLECTUAL INTEGRITY, TRANSPARENCY, RESPECT AND TOLERANCE, RESPONSIBILITY, GOODWILL AND CARE WE ARE FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT IF IN ROMANIA THESE PRINCIPLES OF ACADEMIC MANAGEMENT ARE APPLIED IN GOOD FAITH, THEN THE STANDARD OF EDUCATION AND RESPECT THROUGHOUT THE ACADEMIC LIFE WILL INCREASE.
59	THE GERMAN SOCIOLOGIST NORBERT ELIAS DEVELOPED A WIDE-RANGING SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN PROCESSES OF STATE FORMATION, INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS, AND INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTIVITY, OR HABITUS, AND THE LOGIC OF THEIR PROCESSES OF TRANSFORMATION OVER TIME. HIS WORK HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT IN A WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS, INCLUDING THE HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY OF THE SELF, VIOLENCE, CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, ORGANIZATIONS, EMOTIONS, SEXUALITY, SOCIAL CONTROL, AND SPORT. HIS INFLUENCE IN LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, HOWEVER, HAS CONCENTRATED IN CRIMINOLOGY, WITH ONLY SPORADIC USE OF HIS IDEAS IN RELATION TO OTHER TOPICS IN LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE WAYS IN WHICH ELIAS CAN BE READ AS A THEORIST OF REGULATION BY OUTLINING (A) THE CORE ELEMENTS OF ELIAS'S "PROCESS-FIGURATIONAL" SOCIOLOGY AND HIS ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES OF CIVILIZATION AND DECIVILIZATION; (B) ELIAS'S OBSERVATIONS ON LAW AND STATE FORMATION; (C) A SELECTION OF THE SOCIOLEGAL RESEARCH RELATED TO HIS SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH, IN FIELDS SUCH AS CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, EVOLVING MODES OF REGULATION, AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS; AND (D) THE POTENTIAL FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN WHICH ELIAS'S PROCESS-FIGURATIONAL APPROACH MIGHT MOVE IN SOCIOLEGAL RESEARCH AND SCHOLARSHIP. THESE INCLUDE THE EMOTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF FAMILY LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIANISM, THE INTERSECTIONS OF LEGAL EVOLUTION AND BROADER PROCESSES OF SOCIAL CHANGE, LEGAL PLURALISM AND LEGAL CULTURE, TORT LAW, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
60	THE SPEECH ADDRESSES HOW HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING CHALLENGED AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE ARE WITNESSING THE END TIMES OF HUMAN RIGHTS. NEO-LIBERALISM AND POPULISM COMING FROM DIFFERENT CORNERS CONVERGE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE EROSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS. ATTEMPTS TO LINK HUMAN RIGHTS TO ONE OR THE OTHER ECONOMIC THEORY CONTRIBUTE TO LIFTING HUMAN RIGHTS AWAY FROM THEIR STATUS OF BEING UNIVERSAL. HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT THERE TO SUBSTITUTE IDEOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, INSTEAD IT IS A FAR MORE LIMITED PROJECT. IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SPEECH NEW BOTTOM-UP TRENDS PULLING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ARE HIGHLIGHTED. AS AN OUTCOME OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE GROWING INEQUALITY, A STRONGER AWARENESS HAS EMERGED GLOBALLY ABOUT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF CORRUPTION AND TAX EVASION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. HUMAN RIGHTS ARE REGAINING A MOMENTUM AND CREDIBILITY IN THAT SPACE. THIS IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS CITY MOVEMENT, WHERE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY IN REALIZING HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THEIR CITIZENS. FINALLY, IN THIS PART THE MAINSTREAMING OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN LAWS AND POLITICAL STRATEGIES IS ADDRESSED TOGETHER WITH THE CONCEPT HUMAN RIGHTS BY DESIGN. THE SPEECH ENDS ON A FORWARD-LOOKING NOTE RECOGNIZING THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONTS THE LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS CURRENTLY, HOWEVER, ALSO RECOGNIZING THE DEPTH OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN MOST COMMUNITIES.
61	IN RECENT COMMENTARIES ON BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY, THE NEW LABOUR AND COALITION GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR LACKING STRATEGIC THINKING. ACADEMICS DESCRIBE A STRATEGY GAP' AND NOTE THAT OLD IDEAS ABOUT BRITAIN'S ROLE IN THE WORLD, SUCH AS CHURCHILL'S 1948 REFERENCE TO THREE CIRCLES', CONTINUE TO BE RECYCLED. PARLIAMENTARIANS BEMOAN THE UNCRITICAL ACCEPTANCE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS' THAT HAS LED TO A WANING OF OUR INTERESTS IN, AND ABILITY TO MAKE, NATIONAL STRATEGY'. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A PRIMARY PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE LACK OF CONSIDERATION OF HOW IDENTITY, STRATEGY AND ACTION INTERRELATE IN FOREIGN POLICY. USING THE INSIGHTS OF ROLE THEORY, THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS BY OUTLINING SIX IDEAL-TYPE ROLE ORIENTATIONS THAT THE UK MIGHT FULFIL IN WORLD POLITICS, NAMELY: ISOLATE, INFLUENTIAL (RULE OF LAW STATE), REGIONAL PARTNER, THOUGHT LEADER, OPPORTUNIST-INTERVENTIONIST POWER AND GREAT POWER. BY CONSIDERING HOW VARIATIONS IN A STATE'S DISPOSITION TOWARDS THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT TRANSLATE INTO DIFFERENT POLICY DIRECTIONS, THE ARTICLE AIMS BOTH TO HIGHLIGHT THE RANGE OF ROLES AVAILABLE TO POLICY-MAKERS AND TO EMPHASIZE THAT POLICY OFTEN INVOLVES MAKING A CHOICE BETWEEN THEM. FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THIS HAS RESULTED IN ROLE CONFLICTS AND POLICY CONFUSION. IN SETTING OUT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ROLE ORIENTATIONS, THE AUTHOR OFFERS A ROUTE TO INTRODUCING A GENUINE STRATEGIC SENSIBILITY TO POLICY-MAKING, ONE THAT LINKS IDENTITY WITH POLICY GOALS AND OUTCOMES.
62	SINCE SOEHARTO'S FALL IN 1998, INDONESIA HAS TRANSFORMED FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST AUTHORITARIAN STATES TO ONE OF ITS MOST DEMOCRATIC AND DECENTRALISED. SIGNIFICANT LAWMAKING POWERS HAVE BEEN DEVOLVED TO AROUND 1000 LOCAL LEGISLATURES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS. THE COMBINED LEGAL OUTPUT OF THESE LAWMAKERS HAS ADDED GREAT BULK, COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY TO INDONESIA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. MANY NEW LOCAL LAWS HAVE BEEN CRITICISED FOR BEING MISDIRECTED OR UNCLEAR, VIOLATING CITIZENS' RIGHTS, IMPOSING EXCESSIVE TAXES, EVEN BREACHING INDONESIA'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE BUREAUCRATIC MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT CAN EXERCISE CONTROL OVER LOCAL LAWMAKING, ALLOWING IT TO STRIKE DOWN LOCAL LAWS CONTRAVENING NATIONAL LAW OR THE 'PUBLIC INTEREST'. IT ALSO ANALYSES DECISIONS OF THE INDONESIAN SUPREME COURT, WHICH HAS JURISDICTION TO DECIDE WHETHER LOCAL LAWS CONTRADICT NATIONAL LAWS. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT BUREAUCRATIC AND JUDICIAL REVIEW ARE FLAWED AND ARE USED LARGELY TO REVIEW AND INVALIDATE LOCAL LAWS IMPOSING ILLEGAL TAXATION OR USER CHARGES. LAWS EGREGIOUS FOR OTHER REASONS ARE, THIS RESEARCH SHOWS, LIKELY TO ESCAPE REVIEW ALTOGETHER, OR TO BE UPHELD BY THE SUPREME COURT WITHOUT SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION. THIS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, MAY COMPROMISE THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROVIDED TO CITIZENS IN NATIONAL LAWS AND COULD AFFECT INDONESIA'S ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH SOME OF ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.
63	THE UPSURGE IN THE USE OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA HAS PROMPTED MUCH SCHOLARLY AND POLICY DEBATE OVER THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES. REMARKABLY LITTLE ATTENTION, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THEIR CRIMINALIZING CONSEQUENCES AND LEGACY FOR THE POST-SANCTIONS PERIOD. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IDENTIFYING AND CATEGORIZING THE POTENTIAL CRIMINALIZING EFFECTS OF SANCTIONS ACROSS PLACE (WITHIN AND AROUND THE TARGETED COUNTRY) AND TIME (DURING AND AFTER THE SANCTIONS PERIOD), AND APPLY AND EVALUATE THIS FRAMEWORK THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE CASE OF YUGOSLAVIA. FOR COMPARATIVE LEVERAGE AND TO ASSESS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ARGUMENT BEYOND THE YUGOSLAVIA CASE, THE ANALYSIS IS BRIEFLY EXTENDED TO OTHER CASES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE BALKANS (CROATIA AND IRAQ). THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT SANCTIONS CAN UNINTENTIONALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE STATE, ECONOMY, AND CIVIL SOCIETY OF BOTH THE TARGETED COUNTRY AND ITS IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS, FOSTERING A SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN POLITICAL LEADERS, ORGANIZED CRIME, AND TRANSNATIONAL SMUGGLING NETWORKS. THIS SYMBIOSIS, IN TURN, CAN PERSIST BEYOND THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS, CONTRIBUTING TO CORRUPTION AND CRIME AND UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE IS ONE OF THE FIRST EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE THE STUDY OF SANCTIONS AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIME, AND SUGGESTS THAT THE CRIMINALIZED COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM SANCTIONS AND ITS POST-SANCTIONS LEGACY SHOULD BE MADE A MORE CENTRAL PART OF THE EVALUATION OF SANCTIONS.
64	IF TOLERANCE IS NOT A WORD FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE TEXTS OF ANTIQUITY, ITS SPIRIT NEVERTHELESS APPEARS IN THE HUMANIST CULTURE OF CRITICAL DOUBT, WHICH CONTINUALLY DEFERS CERTITUDE AND, WITH THIS, INTELLECTUAL INTOLERANCE. WITH CICERO, TOLERANCE APPEARS IN THE PRINCIPLE OF A DIALECTICAL MODE OF THINKING AND AS THE FOCUS OF MORAL REFLECTION. FURTHERMORE, EVEN AT THAT TIME, THIS WAY OF CONCEIVING TOLERANCE LAYS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ONGOING CONFLICT BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF A RULE OF LAW APPLYING TO ALL. THE RELIGIOUS DEBATES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, AT THAT TIME DIVIDED BETWEEN PAGANISM AND CHRISTIANITY, BEAR THIS OBSERVATION OUT. THE TRIUMPH OF THE CHURCH DURING THE MIDDLE AGES MIGHT HAVE SIGNIFIED AN ERA OF UNREMITTING DOGMATISM. NEVERTHELESS, THE PERIOD ALSO RESOUNDED WITH THE VOICE OF JOHN OF SALISBURY, FOLLOWED BY THAT OF THOMAS AQUINAS. DURING THE RENAISSANCE, THE NOTION OF TOLERANCE REEMERGED IN THE FORM OF TWO OPPOSING THESES-THAT OF THE PRIVATE EXERCISE OF THE FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE, AS ADVOCATED BY JUSTUS LIPSIUS, VERSUS THAT OF THE COLLECTIVE EXERCISE OF THIS FREEDOM, AS ADVOCATED BY JEAN BODIN. THE EDICT OF NANTES WAS TO ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO VIEWS; IT WAS, AS WELL, THE OUTCOME OF THE INTERSECTION OF AN OLDER HISTORY WITH THE MORE CONTEMPORARY JUSTIFICATIONS OF ITS PROMULGATION.
65	WESTERN THEORIES OF MODERNIZATION AND CULTURAL CHANGE SUPPOSE THAT SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOSTERS SUPPORT FOR FREEDOM AND EQUALITY IN ALL SOCIETIES. CULTURAL RELATIVISM AND "ASIAN VALUES" THESIS CHALLENGE SUCH THEORIES OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN DEVELOPMENT BY ARGUING THAT EAST ASIAN SOCIETIES' CULTURAL LEGACIES PREDISPOSE THEM TO A DISTINCT PATHWAY OF CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY USES NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY AND EUROPEAN VALUES STUDY TO TEST WHETHER EAST ASIAN AND HYSTORICALLY PROTESTANT WESTERN SOCIETIES HOLD SIX DOMAINS OF FREEDOM ASPIRATIONS AS STRONGLY AS THEIR LEVEL OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PREDICTS. PROTESTANT WESTERN NATIONS SCORE CONSISTENTLY HIGH ON ALL FREEDOM ASPIRATIONS, WHILE EAST ASIA'S SCORES ARE HIGHER THAN PREDICTED FOR PERSONAL AUTONOMY AND SECULAR IDENTITY BUT LOWER FOR THE OTHER FOUR DOMAINS: INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, GENDER EQUALITY, POLITICAL LIBERALISM, AND ETHNIC TOLERANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING REVEALS CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE PROTESTANT WESTERN AND EAST ASIAN CULTURAL MODELS. THE DIMENSIONS THESE MODELS ARE DEPICTED BY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SALIENT SOCIETAL OUTCOMES. EAST ASIA'S EMPHASIS ON PERSONAL AUTONOMY AND SECULAR IDENTITY IS COMPATIBLE WITH GOOD PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, LOW CRIME, COMPETITIVE ECONOMY, AND EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS. PROTESTANT WEST'S SUPPORT FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF FREEDOM IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING, DEMOGRAPHIC SUSTAINABILITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND GENDER EQUALITY. CONVERGENCE IN CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT MAY NOT BE EXPECTED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
66	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES DRIVERS FOR THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS AND NEW BUSINESS OWNERS DURING THE AGE OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (SEE). EMPIRICAL RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON A SAMPLE OF 4,066 INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS IN SEVEN SEE COUNTRIES HAS PROVIDED EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT THAT INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER-ISTICS, INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY, MOTIVATION, PERCEPTION OF NATIONAL CULTURE, AND BUSINESS ENVI-RONMENT FACTORS HAVE ON EARLY INTERNATIONALIZATION. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON DATA DERIVED FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) AND THE WORLD BANK. THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY INCLUDED A PRESENTATION OF STATISTICAL RESEARCH USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS AND THE ORDINARY LOGISTICS REGRESSION METHOD. RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT INNOVATION, NEW TECHNOLOGY, OPPORTUNITY, AND MOTIVATION ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR THE EARLY INTERNATIONALIZATION OF ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SEE REGION. EARLY-STAGE ENTREPRENEURS, WHO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND PREFER RADICAL INNOVATIONS, ARE MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS FOREIGN MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS. INCREASE-WEALTH OPPORTUNITY MOTIVATED EARLY-STAGE ENTREPRENEURS TO INTERNATIONALIZE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NECESSITY ENTREPRENEURS, OR EARLY-STAGE ENTREPRENEURS, DRIVEN BY THE MOTIVE OF INDEPENDENCE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS GDP PER CAPITA, OPENNESS, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, THE VOICE OF ACCOUNTABILITY, ECONOMIC STABILITY, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE EARLY INTERNATIONAL-IZATION OF ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SEE REGION.
67	THE QUEST FOR SAFE, ORDERLY AND REGULAR MIGRATION UNDERPINS THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT FOR MIGRATION (GCM) AND TRANSLATES INTO "COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED" RESPONSES TO LARGE MOVEMENTS OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS. THE EFFORT TO DE-COMPARTMENTALISE THE GOVERNANCE OF CROSS-BORDER HUMAN MOBILITY THROUGH "COMPREHENSIVENESS" SHAPES THE OVERALL SEARCH FOR GREATER POLICY COHERENCE VIA REGIME INTERACTION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN THE GCM. A SIMILAR EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE AT THE EU LEVEL TO OVERCOME THE "SILOS APPROACH" CHARACTERISING THE DISTINCT POLICIES ON MIGRATION, ASYLUM, AND BORDER MANAGEMENT. THIS PARALLELISM IS PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL AS THE REASON IS TWOFOLD: AT THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL, BECAUSE OF THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE EU IN FASHIONING THE COOPERATION MODELS UNDERPINNING THE GCM, WHICH ENHANCES THE RELEVANCE OF EU LAW AND PRACTICE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GCM; AT THE NORMATIVE LEVEL, BECAUSE THE GCM DRAWS ON FOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES-I.E., SOVEREIGNTY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, HUMAN-CENTRICITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW-WHICH ARE ALSO KEY FEATURES OF THE EU LEGAL SYSTEM. DEPARTING FROM THESE PREMISES, THIS ARTICLE REVEALS THE MEANING OF "COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED" RESPONSES TO LARGE MOVEMENTS OF REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS IN THE GCM AND EU BORDER POLICIES. IT DOES SO IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE LEGAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF COMPREHENSIVE APPROACHES IN THE GLOBAL AND EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE OF CROSS-BORDER HUMAN MOBILITY.
68	ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A SOUND ENVIRONMENT AND RIGHTS OF NATURE, WHILE PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND PROTECTION, FREQUENTLY DO NOT CORRESPOND TO ARTICULATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIENCES OF INJUSTICE BY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION CAUSED BY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES OR MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WE PRESENT THREE EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED CASE STUDIES THAT EMPLOY CONCEPTS AND METHODS FROM ANTHROPOLOGY TO DEMONSTRATE THIS. THE WORK IS STILL IN PROGRESS, BUT SUFFICIENTLY WELL ADVANCED TO PRESENT SOME FINDINGS. OUR ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH IN ETHIOPIA AND MONGOLIA REVEALS THAT VULNERABLE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TAKE RECOURSE TO CONSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS FAR LESS OFTEN THAN EXPECTED. THE REASONS FOR THIS RANGE FROM RULE-OF-LAW ISSUES TO LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF VULNERABILITY AND RELEVANT NORMS. CONVERSELY, WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS ARE DEMANDED OR CLAIMED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, THEY ARE OFTEN NOT TRANSLATED ADEQUATELY INTO THE LAW OF THE STATE. OUR CASE STUDY ON ECUADOR, WHERE RIGHTS OF NATURE AS A SPECIFIC TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION, SHOWS THAT TRANSFERS FROM LOCAL PRACTICE, WHILE POTENTIALLY HAVING A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT, MAY LEAD TO CONCEPTUAL SELECTIVITY, AMBIGUITY, LACK OF CLARITY, AND OVERLAPS WITH EXISTING STATE NORMS AND, HENCE, REDUNDANCIES. ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS ARE, THEREFORE, A MOVING TARGET WHOSE CONCRETE ADDED VALUE HINGES ON CONTEXT-AS METHODS OF LAW AND ANTHROPOLOGY SERVE TO ILLUSTRATE.
69	WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, ORGANISATIONS HAVE HAD TO FACE NEW REALITIES IN THEIR EXPOSURE TO PUBLIC CONDEMNATION. THUS, SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDE PUBLICS WITH INSTANT ACCESS TO VOICING DISAPPROVAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOUR, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO LONG-TERM NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON ORGANIZATIONAL IMAGE AND EARNINGS (HOLMGREEN 2015). THIS REALISATION FORMS THE BACKGROUND OF THE ARTICLE WHICH DISCUSSES THE CLASH BETWEEN ORGANISATIONAL LEGITIMISATION STRATEGIES, WHICH SEEK TO JUSTIFY ACTIONS THROUGH REFERENCE TO THEIR JUST AND APPROPRIATE CHARACTER, AND THE PUBLIC EVALUATION OF THE VERY SAME CONDUCT AS INAPPROPRIATE AND IMMORAL (BRETON AND COTE 2006; SUCHMAN 1995). DRAWING ON A CRITICAL DISCOURSE APPROACH TO LEGITIMATION (FAIRCLOUGH 2003; VAN LEEUWEN 2008) AND A CORPUS OF PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLIC SOCIAL MEDIA COMMENTS, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CASE OF A DANISH STEAKHOUSE CHAIN WHOSE LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST A SMALLER RESTAURANT OWNER SPURRED A PUBLIC OUTCRY AND FIRESTORM ON SOCIAL MEDIA, LEADING TO THE CHAIN'S IMMINENT CLOSURE FOUR YEARS LATER. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT DISCOURSES THAT REFLECT BASIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL VALUES, ON THE ONE HAND, AND BUSINESS VALUES, ON THE OTHER. THUS, THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF A SHARED SOCIAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, ORGANIZATIONAL AND PUBLIC (LEGITIMATION) STRATEGIES MAY FOLLOW APPARENTLY IRRECONCILABLE PATHS THAT CHALLENGE THE VERY FOUNDATION OF BUSINESS.

70	FORENSIC AGE ASSESSMENT CAN BE A POWERFUL LEVER TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. IN AGE ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SKELETAL AND DENTAL FEATURES IS COMPARED WITH REFERENCE POPULATIONS. THE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (SES) OF THE PERSON TO BE ASSESSED IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS A POSSIBLE INFLUENCING FACTOR ON THE ASSESSMENT OF AGE; HOWEVER, THE AVAILABLE STUDIES ON THIS INFLUENCING FACTOR ARE SCARCE SO FAR. PROSPECTIVELY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SKELETAL OR DENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND SES WAS DETERMINED WITHIN A GERMAN STUDY POPULATION OF VOLUNTEERS. FOR THIS PURPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDIAL EPIPHYSIS OF THE CLAVICLE, THE DISTAL EPIPHYSIS OF THE RADIUS, THE DISTAL EPIPHYSIS OF THE FEMUR, THE PROXIMAL EPIPHYSIS OF THE TIBIA AND THE LEFT LOWER THIRD MOLAR WAS EXAMINED IN 294 FEMALES AND 287 MALES AGED BETWEEN 12 AND 24 YEARS USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) AT 3T. ADDITIONALLY, THE SES OF ALL PERSONS WAS DETERMINED. FOR THIS, THE EDUCATION LEVEL OF THE PARENTS OF THE PERSONS EXAMINED WAS QUERIED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE SES ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS ON THE TOTALITY OF THE EXAMINED SKELETAL CHARACTERISTICS WAS DETERMINED BY LINEAR REGRESSION. NO EVIDENCE FOR A RELATIONSHIP COULD BE FOUND FOR ALL CHARACTERISTICS AND COMBINATIONS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS APPARENTLY DID NOT DIFFER SUFFICIENTLY TO DEMONSTRATE AN INFLUENCE OF THE SES ON SKELETAL AGE.
71	THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW IN CHINA HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS OF TRANSPLANTATION, INTRODUCTION, SELF-RELIANCE AND INNOVATION. IN THE PAST 40 YEARS OF REFORM AND OPENING UP, STARTING FROM BASIC NATIONAL CONDITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS, CHINA HAS CORRECTLY GRASPED INSTITUTIONAL ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS, SHAPED LEGAL VALUE OBJECTIVES, CONSTRUCTED OPERATIONAL MECHANISMS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT, PROACTIVELY CARRIED OUT INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION AND RECONSTRUCTED THE SPIRIT OF LAW, THUS ACHIEVING THE LOCALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, CHINA HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN RESPONDING TO THE ISSUES OF PLURALISM, STAGES, RISK AND NON-MODERNITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL MODERNIZATION AND HAS PROMOTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS EFFECTIVELY COPED WITH THE ISSUES OF DIVERSIFICATION, FRAGMENTATION AND UNILATERALISM IN THE COURSE OF LEGAL INTEGRATION AND HAS PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THEREBY PROVIDING A NEW IMPETUS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. ON THE BASIS OF THE SINICIZATION OR LOCALIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW, CHINA HAS FOUND ITS OWN MEANS OF ACHIEVING THE MODERNIZATION OF LAW AND ITS OWN ROAD TO THE CHOICE OF LEGAL INTEGRATION. THE BASIC ORIENTATION OF ITS LEGAL CHANGES OFFER RICH INNOVATIVE CONNOTATIONS AND A CLEAR PRACTICAL DIRECTION.
72	THIS ARTICLE MAKES A CRITICAL STUDY OF THE CULTURAL APPROACH OF THE PERONIST POLITICAL MAGAZINE LINEA, DURING THE LAST ARGENTINE DICTATORSHIP (1976-1983). THE PERIOD COVERED IS 1980-1982, IN WICH THE MAGAZINE APPEARS TO SUPPORT THE REORGANIZATION OF THE "CAMPO NACIONAL", INTEGRATED BY THE PARTIDO JUSTICIALISTA AND OTHER RELATED POLITICAL PARTIES, TO OPPOSE RIGHT AND LEFT "EXTREMISMS" AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO THE DICTATORSHIP, IN FAVOR OF THE RULE OF LAW. BUT ALSO LINEA PROMOTED THE INCLUSION OF ANALYSIS, INTERVIEWS AND ESSAYS DEALING WITH CULTURAL CONTENTS, ESPECIALLY POPULAR CULTURE AND MEDIA, TO CONTRIBUTE TO DEFINE A "NATIONAL CULTURE", SEEN AS OPPOSING AND THREATENED BY THE ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION IMPOSED BY THE MILITARY REGIME. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS INTELLECTUAL STRATEGY TO GET CULTURAL VOICES CLOSE TO THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE OF THE MAGAZINE LED TO THE COEXISTENCE OF A TRADITIONAL-CULTURAL APPROACH WITH OTHER PERSPECTIVES, MORE INFLUENCED BY CONTEMPORARY DEBATES ON CULTURAL CANON, POPULAR CULTURE, SOCIAL INFLUENCE OF MEDIA AND THE ASSESSMENT OF ITS CULTURAL POTENTIAL IN AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXTS. ALSO, THAT LINEA INCLUDED IN ITS PAGES URBAN CULTURAL MIDDLE CLASS YOUTH EXPRESSIONS, LIKE ROCK MUSIC AND SELF-PRODUCED "SUBTE" MAGAZINES, ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ORIGINAL SIGNIFICANCE; BUT, ALSO, THIS PRACTICES AND PRODUCTS WERE CONSIDERED AS INDICATIVE OF A SOCIAL ACTIVATION, IN THE CONTEXT OF RECOVERED POLITICAL MOBILIZATION FROM THE EARLY EIGHTIES, AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRESSIVE REGIME CRISIS.
73	THE ARTICLE REAPPRAISES THE LAW'S 'EGALITARIAN COMMITMENT' IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL INEQUALITY. IT UPHOLDS THAT SUCH AN EGALITARIAN PREDICAMENT SCARCELY SQUARES WITH THE REALITY. FIRSTLY, INTERNATIONAL GROUPS AIM TO CONTROL HOW WEALTH IS DISTRIBUTED IN SOCIETY; SECONDLY, THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND THE GLOBAL NORTH RISES AT A STEADY RATE. THIRDLY, THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH SHOULD SPREAD GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT, CONCEALS A POLICY OF DOMINATION. FINALLY, GLOBAL FINANCIAL ACTORS CODE THEIR OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE LAW BY SEEKING A CONNECTION WITH THE PUBLIC SPHERE IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC FINANCE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PRIVATE INTERESTS HAVE INFILTRATED THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND CONTRIBUTED, GLOBALLY AND DOMESTICALLY, TO THE RISE OF 'MORTGAGED DEMOCRACIES'. IN SO DOING, IT DRAWS EXAMPLES FROM ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY AND CONSIDERS HOW THE COMMON-LAW MENTALITY HAS FACILITATED THEIR ADVENT. IT THEN EXPLAINS HOW THIS HAS TRIGGERED A CHANGE IN HOW SOCIETIES PERCEIVE THE POLITICAL BOND, WHICH IS NOW ROOTED IN SEVERAL ACTS OF CONVEYANCE. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES US WITH A FURTHER PARADIGM FOR THE ORGANISATION OF COMMUNITIES. ENGLISH LAW HAS BEEN ABLE TO COPE TO THE INIQUITOUS EFFECTS OF THE MORTGAGE BY DEVELOPING THE CONCEPTION OF THE EQUITY OF REDEMPTION. THE REDEMPTION PARADIGM IS PROBABLY ABLE TO CHALLENGE THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS WITHIN SOCIETIES AND THEREFORE RADICALLY TRANSFORM THE IDEA THAT POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS MIGHT BE CONVEYED UPON CONDITION.
74	ARTICLE 38(1)(D) OF THE STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE ATTRIBUTES LIMITED LEGAL AUTHORITY TO JUDICIAL AND ARBITRAL DECISIONS. THEY ARE NOT FORMAL SOURCES OF LAW AND ARE DESCRIBED AS ONLY SUBSIDIARY MEANS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF RULES OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE CONTINUING VALIDITY OF THIS CHARACTERIZATION IS CHALLENGED NOT ONLY BY THE COURT'S PRACTICE OF REFERRING TO ITS OWN JURISPRUDENCE, A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY AND THEORETICALLY ANALYSED ELSEWHERE, BUT ALSO ITS RELATIVELY NEW PRACTICE OF RELYING ON EXTERNAL CASE LAW. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO ONE ASPECT OF THIS NEW PRACTICE, NAMELY THE MARKED INCREASE IN THE COURT'S CITATION OF INTER-STATE ARBITRAL AWARDS SINCE THE 1990S. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COURT REFERS TO INTER-STATE ARBITRAL AWARDS IN ITS DECISIONS FOR THREE PRINCIPAL REASONS - (I) TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A GIVEN RULE, (II) TO SUPPLEMENT ITS LEGAL REASONING OR ITS OWN CASE LAW ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE, AND (III) TO DISTINGUISH AN ARBITRAL AWARD FROM THE CASE BEFORE IT. MORE AMBITIOUSLY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE WAY THE COURT RELIES ON INTER-STATE ARBITRAL AWARDS SHOWS THAT THE COURT ATTRIBUTES LEGAL AUTHORITY TO THESE AWARDS THAT GOES BEYOND THAT OF A SUBSIDIARY MEANS FOR DETERMINING A GIVEN RULE OF LAW, BRINGING IT CLOSER TO WHAT MIGHT BE QUALIFIED AS PERSUASIVE BUT NON-BINDING PRECEDENT.
75	THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF A STATE'S LEGISLATION. ONE OF THESE IS THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH SHOWS A CORRELATION WITH THE POLITICAL ELITE'S COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN ORDER TO GRANT A POSSIBILITY FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF THE GIVEN STATE'S LEGISLATION IN SOME WAY, A CONCEPT OF QUALITY LEGISLATION COULD BE ELABORATED ON, WHICH WOULD BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BECOME THE TOOL OF COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW/LEGISPRUDENCE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, I AIM TO JUSTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF THE TRUST IN DEMOCRACY AND THE LEGISLATION, AND IN THE MEANTIME I AM GOING TO PRESENT THE UNDERLYING THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTIONS. THEN I WILL OFFER A POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION OF THE NOTION OF QUALITY OF LEGISLATION. ALL THESE CORRELATIONS AND THE FRESHLY OFFERED APPROACH TO QUALITY LEGISLATION MAY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN THE EVALUATION OF THE QUALITY OF A GIVEN STATE'S LEGISLATION, AND PERHAPS IT COULD EVEN HELP TO UNDERSTAND FOR WHAT REASON THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION OF CEE STATES AND WESTERN DEMOCRACIES, WHILST POINTING OUT WHAT THESE DIFFERENCES ACTUALLY ARE. AND THIS MAY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE A NEW TREND AND CHALLENGE IN WESTERN EUROPE, MIGHT (OR MIGHT NOT) BE AN INNOVATION STILL TO BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IN THE CEE REGION.
76	AS JOSEPH SCHACHT ARGUED IN THE 1950S, THE OFFICE OF QADI BEGAN IN THE UMAYYAD PERIOD AS THAT OF A "LEGAL SECRETARY" TO PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS. DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE FROM EGYPT CONFIRMS THAT GOVERNORS WERE INDEED REGARDED AS THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IN EARLY ISLAM, AND THAT THEIR LEGAL POWERS FAR SURPASSED THAT OF ANY OTHER JUDGE. IN LARGE CITIES, GOVERNORS APPOINTED AND DISMISSED QADIS AT WILL; DECISIONS TAKEN BY QADIS COULD BE SWIFTLY OVERRULED BY POLITICAL AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH THE 'ABBASIDS REFORMED AND CENTRALISED THE JUDICIARY IN THE SECOND HALF OF SECOND/EIGHTH CENTURY, QADIS WERE STILL SUBORDINATE TO REIGNING RULERS AND UNABLE TO IMPOSE JUDGEMENTS THAT DISPLEASED THE CALIPH OR HIS MAIN REPRESENTATIVES. THE INCREASING POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE OF SCHOLARS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSICAL SCHOOLS OF LAW EVENTUALLY CHANGED THIS SITUATION. RELYING ON A BODY OF BOTH NARRATIVE AND LEGAL LITERATURE, THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QADIS' ATTEMPTS TO RESIST POLITICAL RULERS' INTERFERENCE WITH THE JUDICIARY BY ASSERTING THEMSELVES AS TRUE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SHARIA. IT ARGUES THAT HANAFI LEGAL LITERATURE, DATING FROM THE THIRD/NINTH AND FOURTH/TENTH CENTURIES, GRADUALLY ELABORATED A THEORY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE QADI AND THE RULER. THIS THEORY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN DOING AWAY WITH POLITICAL INFRINGEMENT ON THE JUDICIAL PREROGATIVE AND WAS SOON INCORPORATED INTO ADAB LITERATURE, WHOSE STORIES OF RULERS ENTIRELY SUBJUGATED TO THE RULE OF LAW BECAME A NEW POLITICAL MODEL.
77	STATE RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS BY ENSHRINING THEM IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTS IS THE FIRST AND MOST URGENT STEP TOWARDS THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO THIS SOLE ASPECT. THE STATE SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO GUARANTEE, PROTECT, AND DEFEND BOTH HUMAN AND CITIZEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, WHICH DETERMINES ITS MAIN DIRECTION OF HUMANIZATION AND HUMANITARIAN CHARACTERISTICS. VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH CONSTITUTE AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL MECHANISM TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE OBSERVANCE AND PROTECTION OF THESE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN UKRAINE. THE ACTIVITY OF THESE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IS PRIMARILY AIMED AT REFORMING THE NATIONAL SYSTEM IN THIS REGARD, RULEMAKING, AND ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE CONSIDERED AN ADDITIONAL GUARANTEE FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO REVIEW THE ROLE AND INFLUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS, THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE IN THE FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL MECHANISM TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN UKRAINE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS ADOPTED WITHIN THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THEIR SPECIFIC FEATURES, ROLE, AND IMPLEMENTATION IN THE COUNTRY.
78	LAST YEAR'S SUBMISSION CANVASSED JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAT WERE RELEASED PRIOR TO, AND POST-IMPLEMENTATION OF COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. THE ADVENT OF COVID-19 CAUSED UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISRUPTION AND NO INDUSTRY OR SOCIAL INSTITUTION WAS IMMUNE TO ITS EFFECT. ALBERTA WAS ALREADY ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG THE PROVINCES WHEN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC EXACTED ITS MULTI-FACETED TOLL. ONE ASPECT WAS A SERIOUS DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR OIL, WHICH FURTHER IMPACTED OIL PRICES, AND THE VERY MANNER IN WHICH ENERGY INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS WOULD OPERATE IN THE NEAR AND LONGER TERMS. THE JUDICIARY, AND THE BROADER LEGAL SYSTEM, SUFFERED NO LESS AN IMPACT, AND EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW AND PRESERVE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. NOT WITHSTANDING THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES ALL HAVE ENDURED SINCE MARCH 2020, MANY REPORTED DECISIONS OF SIGNIFICANCE TO ENERGY INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY CANADIAN COURTS OVER THE PAST YEAR. THIS ARTICLE SUMMARIZES A SELECTION OF KEY DECISIONS COVERING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CANADIAN LAW OF CONTRACT, ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT, INSOLVENCY, ABORIGINAL, EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR, MINORITY SHAREHOLDER'S RIGHTS, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTS IN CIVIL LITIGATION PROCEDURE. IN EACH TOPIC AREA THE IDENTIFIED CASES ARE REVIEWED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR FACTS, A SUMMARY OF THE DECISION, AND A BRIEF COMMENTARY AS TO THE IMPLICATIONS OR GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CASE.
79	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASINGLY ENTERED INTO THE ARCTIC CONTEXT. FOR RUSSIA, THE ARCTIC MEANS ENORMOUS NATURAL RESOURCES AND POTENTIAL FOR THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING. THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER IS THE DYNAMICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ARCTIC LEGISLATION IN RUSSIA; ATTENTION IS ALSO GIVEN TO THE RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION OF LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC. SPECIFICALLY, IT DISCUSSES BARRIERS IN TRANSITIONING TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ESTIMATES RELEVANT LEGAL TOOLS USED OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES APPLICABLE TO THE ARCTIC TERRITORIES. THE GENERAL IDEA IS THAT DESPITE STRONG POLITICAL WILL TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, RUSSIA'S UNSTABLE ECONOMY HAS IMPEDED THE COUNTRY'S SUSTAINABILITY DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES. CONSEQUENTLY, RESOURCE-BASED DEVELOPMENT IS PRIORITIZED OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND PUTS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRAGILE TERRITORIES, LIKE THE ARCTIC, AT GREAT RISK. THE RESEARCH METHODS INCLUDE CONTEXT ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL AND REGIONAL LAWS AND CONTEXTUAL INTERVIEWS AT THE FEDERAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVELS. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH ARE THE IDENTIFICATION OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND DEFICIENCIES IN THE RULE OF LAW RELATED TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC AS WELL AS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THE PAPER OUTLINES THAT AS LONG AS RUSSIAN LEGISLATION LACKS SPECIFIC RULES ADDRESSING SUSTAINABILITY IN THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THIS TERRITORY.
80	USING EUROPEAN UNION FUNDS INVOLVES A COMPLEX PROCESS; MEMBER STATES MUST ADHERE TO WIDE-RANGING EU AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATION, NON-COMPLIANCE CAN LEAD TO IRREGULARITIES. BESIDES ACCORDANCE WITH THE LETTER OF THE LAW, ALSO THE GENERAL EU BUDGETARY PRINCIPLES, IN PARTICULAR SOUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, MUST BE GIVEN FULL CONSIDERATION. THE PAPER PRESENTS HUNGARY'S EVOLVING APPROACH TO HANDLING IRREGULARITIES AND HER EXPERIENCE IN CREATING THE CORRESPONDING LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE RESEARCH ALSO ASSESSES HOW THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, IN PARTICULAR OF ITS AUDITORS, HAS CONTRIBUTED TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTIES. IN THE DRAFT LEGISLATION FOR THE 2021-2027 BUDGETARY PERIOD, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSES A NEW REQUIREMENT, NAMELY THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY.(3) ITS CLARITY AND OBJECTIVITY, HOWEVER, ARE STILL BEING WIDELY DISCUSSED. ADDITIONALLY, COHESION POLICY CONDITIONALITIES HAVE ALWAYS CONTAINED AN OBLIGATION FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE INSTITUTIONS - INCLUDING THE COURTS. NONETHELESS, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COURTS IN RELATION TO PROCEEDING IRREGULARITY AND RECOVERY DISPUTES. THE PRESENTED HUNGARIAN CASE STUDY NOT ONLY EXPLAINS THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THAT CALL FOR REVISITING THE APPEAL SYSTEM IN HUNGARY; IT WARNS OF THE GENERAL DIFFICULTIES MEMBER STATES MAY FACE WHEN EMBEDDING THE IRREGULARITY AND RECOVERY MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS INTO THEIR NATIONAL LEGISLATION, WHEREAS THE PAPER ALSO GIVES NOTICE TO THE LONG-AWAITED ANALYSIS OF THE ROOT PROBLEMS INVOKING IRREGULARITIES.
81	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAWS PROHIBITING THE INTENTIONAL TARGETING OF NONCOMBATANTS IN INTERSTATE WAR, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON THE ROLE OF THIRD-PARTY STATES IN ENFORCEMENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE EXPECTATION OF THIRD-PARTY COERCION, WHEN SUFFICIENTLY HIGH, CAN INDUCE WAR PARTICIPANTS TO COMPLY WITH THIS BODY OF LAW. WE IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH COMBATANT STATES WILL ANTICIPATE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF COERCION, DEMONSTRATING THAT THIRD-PARTY STATES ARE MOST LIKELY TO COERCE COMBATANTS WHEN THEY HAVE BOTH THE WILLINGNESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. DEMOCRATIC THIRD PARTIES THAT VALUE THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS POSSESS THE WILLINGNESS TO COERCE WAR PARTICIPANTS, WHILE STRONG ALLIES, TRADE PARTNERS, AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (IGO) PARTNERS WITH EXISTING TIES TO THE COMBATANT STATE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN COERCION BY LINKING COMBAT-ANT BEHAVIOR TO THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS OR IMPOSITION OF COSTS. BASED ON THIS LOGIC, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT WAR COMBATANTS WHO HAVE RATIFIED THE GENEVA/HAGUE CONVENTIONS PROHIBITING THE INTENTIONAL TARGETING OF NONCOMBATANTS DURING WAR ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLY WITH THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS INCLUDED IN THOSE CONVENTIONS WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH RELATIVELY STRONG DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE, TRADE, AND IGO PARTNERS. IN A SERIES OF QUANTITATIVE TESTS ON A DATA SET OF ALL INTERSTATE WARS FROM 1900 TO 2003, WE FIND STRONG STATISTICAL AND SUBSTANTIVE SUPPORT FOR THE ROLE OF THIRD PARTIES IN INDUCING COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.
82	THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN POST- COMMUNIST EASTERN EUROPE SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM IN 1989. THE ANALYSIS IS FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF LUSTRATION AND THE OPENING OF COMMUNIST SECRET POLICE FILES IN ENCOURAGING ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. AN OVERVIEW OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION - INCLUDING BULGARIA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, HUNGARY, POLAND AND SLOVAKIA - EMPHASIZES THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES UNDERTAKEN IN DEALING WITH THE ABUSES AND CRIMES COMMITTED BY PREVIOUS NON-DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS. THESE DIFFERENCES ARE EXAMINED IN RELATIONSHIP TO THREE INTERRELATED VARIABLES: (1) THE EXIT MODE FROM COMMUNISM; (2) THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME; AND (3) THE POLITICS OF THE PRESENT. THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ROMANIAN CASE, WHOSE SPECIFICITY LIES IN ITS VIOLENT AND ABRUPT EXIT FROM COMMUNISM. THE UNFINISHED RECKONING WITH THE PAST IN ROMANIA LEADS US TO TWO MAIN CONCLUSIONS. FIRST, THE NATURE OF COMMUNIST ELITES AND THE OPPOSITION TO THEM ARE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE POLITICS OF THE PRESENT SHAPES THE WAY IN WHICH THE PAST IS ADDRESSED. SECOND, IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL POSSIBLE RECONCILIATION THROUGH PUBLIC EXPOSURE - AT LEAST SYMBOLICALLY - OF THOSE INVOLVED IN REPRESSION, DELAYED TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS INEFFECTIVE.
83	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS. IT DISCUSSES THE PURPOSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS WHICH ACT, INTER ALIA, AS A MECHANISM FOR CREATING LEGAL CERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO AMBIGUOUS TERMS, AND TO PREVENT CUMBROUS DRAFTSMANSHIP OF LEGISLATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS IS THAT FROM THEM, USUALLY, THE INCIDENCE OF LAW IS INFERRED. LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS NOT ONLY DETERMINE THE LEGAL MEANING OF A TERM, RATHER THEY COERCIVELY DETERMINE THE SOLE WAY BY WHICH A TERM SHOULD BE USED IN CERTAIN FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BY THAT, THE LAW BECOMES THE MAIN SOURCE THROUGH WHICH LANGUAGE IS USED AS A MECHANISM FOR SOCIAL CONTROL. IN OTHER WORDS, LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS, CONTRARY TO DICTIONARIES' DEFINITIONS, ARE AUTHORITATIVE. THE ARTICLE CONTINUES TO ELABORATE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEFINITIONS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND BETWEEN DEFINITIONS AND STATUTORY INTERPRETATION. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES ATTACHED TO THE USE OF LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN A TERM IS GIVEN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MEANING THAN THE COMMON ONE. THE BASIC CLAIM UNDERPINNING THE ARTICLE IS THAT WHILE LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS SEEM PRIMA FACIE INTERPRETIVE RULES OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO THE SUBSTANTIVE RULES, DEFINITIONS CAN HAVE AS MUCH IMPACT AS NEW AND DIRECT SUBSTANTIVE RULES, AND THEY HAVE SIMILAR CONSEQUENCES. THEREFORE, LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS ARE A COMPLEX AND POWERFUL TOOL WHICH MUST BE USED CAREFULLY.
84	IN OCTOBER 2012, A PANEL OF THE D. C. CIRCUIT DEALT A BLOW TO THE UNITED STATES' POST-SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 DECADE-LONG EXPERIMENT WITH MILITARY COMMISSIONS AS A FORUM FOR TRYING GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES. SPECIFICALLY, THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT PRIOR TO THE 2006 STATUTORY REFORMS, MILITARY COMMISSION JURISDICTION WAS LIMITED TO VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED WAR CRIMES; THAT PROVIDING MATERIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORISM WAS NOT AN INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED WAR CRIME; AND THAT THE MILITARY COMMISSION CONVICTION OF SALIM HAMDAN FOR MATERIAL SUPPORT CHARGES BASED ON PRE-2006 CONDUCT WAS THEREFORE INVALID. THREE MONTHS LATER, A PANEL OF THE D. C. CIRCUIT REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION WITH RESPECT TO CONSPIRACY AND SOLICITATION CHARGES, AND VACATED THE CONVICTION AND LIFE SENTENCE OF GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEE ALI HAMZA AHMAD AL BAHLUL. THAT CASE IS NOW ON APPEAL TO AN EN BANC (FULL COURT) PANEL OF THE D. C. CIRCUIT. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE D. C. CIRCUIT'S RULING IN HAMDAN'S CASE, EXPLAINING WHY THE ULTIMATE HOLDING IS THE RIGHT ONE, EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE REASONING IS FLAWED, AND WHY THE RULING SHOULD BE UPHELD ON APPEAL. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE MANY UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS AT GUANTANAMO BAY. AS THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS, THE D. C. CIRCUIT'S RULINGS ARE A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND A MAJOR DEFEAT FOR COMMISSIONS.
85	THIS ESSAY FIRST LOOKS AT "ENTERPRISE DEMOCRACY," AS DEFINED BY LAW, IN CHINA, AND EXAMINES WHY IT HAS NEVER BEEN GENUINELY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW THIS RELATES TO WORKERS' FAILURE TO RESIST THE PRIVATIZATION OF THEIR ENTERPRISES AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. IT EXPLORES THE CRIPPLING CLAUSES IN THE LAWS, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATING TO THE ACFTU (ALL CHINA FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS), WHICH ALSO SHOW THE DEEP HOSTILITY OF THE RULING PARTY TOWARDS ANY SIGN OF AUTONOMOUS MOVEMENT FROM BELOW. IT LINKS THE PARTY'S LACK OF INCENTIVE TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW TO THE MATERIAL INTERESTS OF THE RULING BUREAUCRACY, AND ARGUES THAT THIS CAN BE TRACED BACK TO MAO'S PERIOD. IT THEREFORE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE NOTION, PUT FORWARD BY SOME, THAT THE CHINESE WORKING CLASS IN THE STATE SECTOR WAS REALLY THE "MASTER OF THE HOUSE" IN THAT PERIOD. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF DECADES OF ATOMIZATION PRIOR TO THE REFORM PERIOD, WORKERS WERE LEFT DEFENSELESS WHEN THE MARKET REFORM ATTACK STARTED. ALTHOUGH THEY ROSE TO PROTEST IN MILLIONS IN 1989, THE DEFEAT OF THE MOVEMENT PAVED THE WAY FOR A SECOND WAVE OF ATTACKS ON WORKERS, NAMELY THE PRIVATIZATION OF STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES WITH A DEBATE ON THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM THE CHINESE WORKERS' DEMISE AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR THEM.
86	THE PROPER COEXISTENCE OF HUMANS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LIVING WORLD IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRECONDITIONS FOR FORMING THE RULE OF LAW. THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF THE BIOCENTRIC CONCEPT, UNDER THE AUSPICES OF BIOETHICAL AND ANIMAL-ETHICAL THINKING, THE LEGAL REGULATION OF HUMANS AND ANIMALS DEVELOPS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ANIMAL LAW AS A RELATIVELY NEW BRANCH OF LAW. ONE OF THE CENTRAL TOPICS WITHIN THE MENTIONED LEGAL BRANCH IS THE DISCUSSION OF ANIMALS AS OBJECTS OF PROPERTY (PROPRIETARY) RIGHTS AND, POTENTIALLY, AS HOLDERS OF CERTAIN LEGAL RIGHTS. THE ABOVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO PROPERTY LAW AND THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF CIVIL LAW, GIVEN THAT THE CROATIAN OWNERSHIP AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ACT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY MENTION THE STATUS OF AN ANIMAL, BUT THE STATUS OF AN ANIMAL AS A THING DERIVES FROM THE CROATIAN PROPERTY LAW DOCTRINE. THE PAPER ANALYTICALLY, HISTORICALLY AND COMPARATIVELY EXAMINES THE CURRENT LEGAL STATUS OF ANIMALS AS OBJECTS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. HISTORICAL INSIGHT REFERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARADIGMATIC POSITION OF ANIMALS AS THINGS ESTABLISHED IN ROMAN PRIVATE LAW. ANALYTICAL ELABORATION OF CURRENT PROPERTY LAW STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND REFLECTION OF PROPERTY LAW DOCTRINE ARE PLACED IN THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL CONTEXT OF THE CIVIL LAW PROVISIONS OF THOSE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RECOGNIZED ANIMALS AS NON-THINGS OR AS SENTIENT BEINGS.
87	AFGHANISTAN FACES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AS IT SEEKS TO EMERGE FROM THIRTY YEARS OF CIVIL WAR AND INSURGENT VIOLENCE AND PROMOTE LASTING PEACE AND SECURITY. TERRORIST INCIDENTS, WHICH HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY SINCE 2004, CONTINUE TO POSE A MAJOR THREAT TO SECURITY, DESTABILIZING GOVERNANCE AND FRACTURING STATE INITIATIVES TO GUARANTEE RULE OF LAW TO CITIZENS. AN URGENT PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AS PART OF ITS DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY, IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FORMAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RESPONDS EFFECTIVELY TO THE THREAT OF TERRORISM BY CREATING MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES THAT SUPPORT THE RIGHTS AND NEEDS OF VICTIMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. TO DATE, EXAMINING VICTIMHOOD IN AFGHANISTAN AND ACCURATELY UNDERSTANDING THE ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT THAT VICTIMS OF TERRORISM RECEIVE AND TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED DURING CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESSES HAVE AVOIDED ACADEMIC SCRUTINY. INFORMED BY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH JUSTICE OFFICIALS IN AFGHANISTAN, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO FILL THIS IMPORTANT GAP IN SCHOLARSHIP. IT DOES SO BY DRAWING ON AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR GOOD PRACTICES OUTLINED IN THE GLOBAL COUNTERTERRORISM FORUM'S MADRID MEMORANDUM TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON GAPS IN EXISTING NATIONAL LAW. IN DOING SO, IT MAKES IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOTH INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE REFORM DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS AND ASSISTANCE FOR VICTIMS OF TERRORISM AND INFORM CONTEMPORARY REVIEWS OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LAW BEING UNDERTAKEN BY JUSTICE MINISTRIES IN AFGHANISTAN.
88	THE NORDIC COUNTRIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN REGARDED AS PIONEERS IN THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. IN 2016, SWEDEN AND FINLAND CELEBRATED THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WORLD'S FIRST FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ACT, PASSED IN 1766. EVEN LATER ON, THE HISTORY OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION REMAINED PRIMARILY SYNONYMOUS WITH THAT OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. THE DANISH AUTOCRACY'S REGULATION ON THE BOUNDARIES OF PRESS FREEDOM IN 1799 RESTRICTED THE PREVIOUSLY TOLERATED FREEDOM OF THE PRESS BUT WAS BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ON TWO PRINCIPLES, NAMELY THE ABSENCE OF ADVANCE CENSORSHIP AND THE RIGHT OF THE AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER TO HAVE THEIR CASE TRIED BEFORE A COURT. THESE PRINCIPLES WERE REPEATED IN THE SWEDISH INSTRUMENT OF GOVERNMENT OF 1809, THE NORWEGIAN CONSTITUTION OF 1814 AND THE DANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1849. EVEN THE GRAND DUCHY OF FINLAND, WHICH WAS IN RUSSIA'S POSSESSION, RECEIVED ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL STATUTE CONCERNING THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN 1906. IN REALITY, HOWEVER, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WAS OFTEN UNDER THREAT AS ALL THOSE IN POWER WERE OPPOSED TO THE RIGHT OF THE OPPOSITION TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. JUDICIAL CONTROL THEREFORE ACTED AS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION FOR THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, BUT EVEN THIS SHIELD HAD ITS LIMITS DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL VIEWS OF THE JUDGES.
89	THE ROAD TO INTEGRATION OF BULGARIA WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL IF ACCESSION TO THE EU IS CONSIDERED THE END GOAL. BUT IF WE BROADEN OUR ANALYTICAL LENS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE ROAD HAS BEEN UNEVEN. THE ACHIEVED OBJECTIVE OF ACCESSION HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY TEN YEARS OF UNEVENLY PACED REFORM AND BACKSLIDING. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS UNSATISFACTORY DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INFORMALITY. THE CASE STUDY IS STRUCTURED IN THREE THEMATIC PARTS. FIRSTLY, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN BULGARIA IN THE POSTCOMMUNIST DECADES ARE DISCUSSED FROM AN EMPIRICAL POINT OF VIEW, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON CORRUPTION, ELECTORAL PARTICIPATION, CITIZEN TRUST, AND RULE OF LAW. SECONDLY, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO EXAMINE COMMUNIST POWER NETWORKS IN SEARCH OF AN EXPLANATION FOR THE TRENDS OF STATE CAPTURE OBSERVED TODAY. A KEY CONTRIBUTION OF THE ARTICLE IS THE CONCLUSION THAT INFORMAL RELATIONSHIPS AND CLIENTELISM ARE NOT MERELY A BYPRODUCT OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COMMUNIST' SYSTEM BUT ITS VERY ESSENCE. THIRDLY, ON THAT BASIS, CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION OF BULGARIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITH A SIMILAR BACKGROUND. THE AUTHOR'S FINDINGS ARE THAT SUCH A TRANSFORMATION IS ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE MODE OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE-FROM A WEAK CAPTURED STATE AND INFORMALITY OF POWER STRUCTURES TO PUBLIC POLICIES THROUGH PARTNERSHIP.
90	THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO DETERMINE IF IT IS LIKELY FOR TURKEY TO REMAIN A STABLE COUNTRY THAT WILL AVOID SERIOUS INTERNAL CONFLICTS AND VIOLENT CONFLICTS ABROAD. THE PAPER EXAMINES LONG-TERM CULTURAL AND CIVILIZATIONAL VARIABLES OF COSMOPOLITANISM AND RATIONALITY. IT EXAMINES INDICATORS THAT ARE MORE IMMEDIATELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESCALATION OF AN INTERNAL CONFLICT: VIOLENT CRIMINALITY, YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, INCOME INEQUALITY, CORRUPTION PERCEPTION, AND POLITICAL TERROR. IN THE END, IT EXAMINES THE LEVEL OF MILITARIZATION AND THE EVOLUTION AND CURRENT STATE OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS. IT CONCLUDES THAT MOST OF THE INDICATORS DO NOT BODE WELL FOR THE STABILITY AND DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION OF TURKEY. THE REASON TURKEY HAS NOT SUCCUMBED TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY IS LIKELY DUE TO ITS HIGH LEVEL OF POLITICAL REPRESSION. GIVEN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TURKISH SOCIETY, TWO BASIC SCENARIOS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ARE FEASIBLE: TURKEY CAN EITHER BECOME MUCH LESS STABLE AND A VICTIM TO SOCIAL DISCORD WITH A CHANCE OF DANGEROUS ESCALATION; OR IT WILL CEMENT ITS AUTHORITARIANISM AND MANAGE SOCIAL ORDER BY DRACONIAN POLICING, DISPROPORTIONATE "COUNTER-TERRORISM" LAWS AND DISREGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW. NEITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS IS FAVOURABLE FOR ITS NATO ALLIES, WHO MUST ENGAGE TURKEY AND WORK WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EXISTING ALLIANCES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF TURKEY EITHER BECOMING A ROGUE PLAYER OR A STATE EMBROILED IN A CIVIL CONFLICT.
91	CONTEMPORARY CHINA NEEDS TO CHANGE FROM A WESTERN TO A CHINESE-STYLE GOVERNANCE DISCOURSE SO AS TO FORM AND EXPLORE A CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE DISCOURSE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THIS IS PROFOUNDLY EVIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING: THE MARXIST PHILOSOPHY OF THE STATE IS THE THEORETICAL PREMISE OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA'S CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE; TRADITIONAL CHINESE THOUGHT ON GOVERNANCE AND PRACTICE ARE THE SOIL IN WHICH CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE GROWS; SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IS THE REALM IN WHICH CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE EXISTS; THE MASSES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CPC ARE THE NECESSARY SUBJECTS OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE; AND THE TARGET OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE IS A MULTI-LAYERED AND DIVERSE EXISTENCE. REALIZATION OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE THROUGH CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY IS THE BASIC FORM OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE; THE BALANCED DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC, COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS IS THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE; THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE ARE EQUALITY, INCLUSIVENESS AND PEACE; AND THE CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING CONTEMPORARY CHINESE CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE ARE AUTHORITY, CONSENSUS, INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. GUIDED BY THE MARXIST VIEW OF THE STATE, ROOTED IN THE TRADITION OF CHINA'S FINE POLITICAL CULTURE, AND FOUNDED ON THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CLAIMS OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, SOCIALIST CONSULTATIVE GOVERNANCE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS CONSTITUTES THE CHINESE FORM OF CONTEMPORARY GOVERNANCE THEORY.
92	THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT TO MOVE FROM QUESTIONING THE AUTONOMY OF LAW FROM THE EXTERNAL STANDPOINT OF SOCIOLOGY TO PROBLEMATIZING IT FROM THE INTERNAL LEGAL STANDPOINT. THE FIRST STEP IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE KELSENIAN THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED SELF-PRODUCTION OF LAW, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONCEPT OF REASON FOR THE VALIDITY OF A NORM AND OF A LEGAL ORDER, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF EFFICACY AS A CONDITION FOR VALIDITY. THE SECOND IS A PRESENTATION OF LUHMANN'S CONCEPTION OF AUTOPOIESIS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND IN PARTICULAR THE FUNCTION OF THE CONSTITUTION IN THE OPERATIVE CLOSURE OF LAW. BASED ON THIS EXPOSITION, THE DISCUSSION THEN FOCUSES ON THE LIMITS OF BOTH CONCEPTIONS, BUT IN REVERSE ORDER: FIRST QUESTIONING THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSPORTING THE CONCEPT OF AUTOPOIESIS TO THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR REPRODUCTION OF LAW IN CONTEMPORARY WORLD SOCIETY, AND THEN RAISING OBJECTIONS TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE CONCEPT OF HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED SELF-PRODUCTION OF LAW TO THE MANY DIFFERENT LEGAL ORDERS IN TODAY'S WORLD. THE CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM THESE CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS IS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE LUHMANNIAN SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY OF THE OPERATIVE SELF-REFERENCE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE KELSENIAN LEGAL THEORY OF THE SELF-PRODUCED STEP-STRUCTURE OF LAW ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO LEGAL SYSTEMS MINIMALLY GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW.
93	WHEREAS PENT'S PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI WAS REWARDED WITH RE-ELECTION AFTER HE SUSPENDED THE CONSTITUTION AND DISSOLVED CONGRESS IN APRIL 1992, GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT JORGE SERRANO'S EFFORTS IN MAY 1993 TO EMULATE FUJIMORI LED TO AN IGNOMIOUS EXILE. SIMILAR EVENTS LED TO PRESIDENTIAL SELF-COUPS IN BOTH COUNTRIES, YET THE OUTCOMES WERE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT. IN BOTH COUNTRIES THE OUTSIDER PRESIDENTS WHO WERE ELECTED IN 1990 ADOPTED A PERSONAL AND DICTATORIAL STYLE OF RULE; BOTH PRESIDENTS FACED OPPOSITION TO THEIR ECONOMIC AUSTERITY MEASURES; AND IN BOTH COUNTRIES, RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATURE AND JUDICIARY WERE TENSE. THE DIFFERENCE IN OUTCOMES CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THESE COMMON FACTORS; INSTEAD DIFFERENT OUTCOMES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO LEVELS OF THREAT PERCEPTION. THE HIGHER LEVEL OF PERCEPTION OF THREAT IN PERU WAS CAUSED BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SHINING PATH REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATION, WHEREAS IN GUATEMALA THE REBELS HAD BEEN ALL BUT DEFEATED THIS CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE AFFECTED PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE AUTOGOLPES, THE UNITY OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THE STRENGTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION. MOREOVER THE PERCEPTION OF THREAT WAS DELIBERATELY EXAGGERATED BY THE PERUVIAN AUTHORITIES, THEREBY JUSTIFYING WIRIER EXECUTIVE POWERS AND A PATTERN OF GREATER ABUSES FOLLOWING THE SELF-COUP. THE FAILURE OF SERRANO'S EFFORTS, THANKS LARGELY TO THE LOWER LEVEL OF THREAT PERCEPTION, HAD THE REVERSE EFFECT: DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE STRENGTHENED.
94	FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY CAN FACILITATE THE TRANSITION TOWARDS A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND RESPONSIBLE ECONOMY. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS CANNOT UNDERMINE THE NEED TO MANAGE FINANCIAL AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION ACTIVITIES. TO THIS END, THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ON THE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT OF THE EMERGING-7 ECONOMIES FROM 2000 TO 2019. THE STUDY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSES ON THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FACTORS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ROBUST INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS. WE EMPLOY THE STIRPAT (STOCHASTIC IMPACTS BY REGRESSION ON POPULATION, AFFLUENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY) MODEL AS THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THIS STUDY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THREE ASPECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH ARE: (I) THE DEPTH OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, (II) THE STABILITY OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND (III) THE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THIS STUDY HAS DEVELOPED AN INSTITUTIONAL INDEX USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. THE INDEX COMPRISES SEVERAL CRUCIAL INDICATORS: CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE STUDY RAISES THE IMPORTANCE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN TERMS OF ENERGY INTENSITY ON ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT. THE STUDY'S FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WITHOUT ROBUST INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS, THE POTENTIAL OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT DEPTH, STABILITY, AND EFFICIENCY TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL WELL-BEING MAY NOT BE FULLY REALIZED. HOWEVER, THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THESE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS POSITIVELY IMPACT MITIGATING THE ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT.
95	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF INVESTMENT CLIMATE ON FDI IN AFRICA USING A DATASET THAT SPANS 2000 TO 2018. IT ALSO HYPOTHESISED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND FDI COULD VARY BY COUNTRY CLASSIFICATION AS A LANDLOCKED, LEAST DEVELOPED (LDC), NATURAL RESOURCE-ABUNDANT OR HAS A DEVELOPED FINANCIAL MARKET SYSTEM (DFM). THE SYSTEM'S GMM AND THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL WITH DRISCOLL-KRAAY STANDARD ERRORS RESULTS SHOW THAT INVESTMENT CLIMATE IS CRITICAL FOR FDI IN AFRICA, RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES AND THOSE WITH DFM. CONVERSELY, THE ROLE OF THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE IS LESS SIGNIFICANT IN LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES, WHICH UNDERSCORES THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF HETEROGENEITY TO AVOID FALSE-POSITIVE CONCLUSIONS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE MODERATING ROLE OF THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND GDP IS NONTRIVIAL IN THE RELATIONSHIP. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LDCS AND LANDLOCKED COUNTRIES NEED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR INVESTMENT CLIMATES BY ADOPTING POLICIES THAT ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW, FIGHT CORRUPTION AND BUILD ROBUST INSTITUTIONS TO ATTRACT FDI. IT ALSO SHOWS HOW RESEARCHERS CAN NAVIGATE THE CONSIDERABLE ENCUMBRANCE OF DEALING WITH SEVERAL CONSTRUCTS OF THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE BY EMPLOYING PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS, WHICH GIVES THE OPTIMAL GRANULARITY REQUIRED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THIS MORE SPECIFIC DEFINITION IS CRITICAL WHEN THE INTENT IS TO MAKE GENERALITIES ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE.
96	PURPOSE MUCH OF EXISTING RESEARCH HAS ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN ASIAN GROWTH PARADOX THROUGH FORMAL INSTITUTION - ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO EMPIRICALLY EXPLAIN THE PARADOX WITH INFORMAL INSTITUTION INCLUDING INTERACTION BETWEEN INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS. TWO INTERRELATED RESEARCH QUESTIONS SUMMARIZE THIS RESEARCH. FIRST, HOW CAN WE CAPTURE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS? THEN, HOW IS THAT RELATIONSHIP DIFFERENT FOR ASIAN PARADOX STATES VS NON-PARADOX STATES? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TO CAPTURE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, WE USE HELMKE AND LEVITSKY (2004)'S FRAMEWORK TO CATEGORIZE THE INTERACTION AS COMPLEMENTING, COMPETING, SUBSTITUTING AND ACCOMMODATING. WE PERFORM CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR MORE THAN 130 COUNTRIES. FINDINGS WE FIND THAT THE DEVELOPED, DEVELOPING AND THE ASIAN PARADOX STATES DISPLAY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FIND THAT THE INTERACTION EFFECT HAS A LIMITED VALUE EXPLAINING GROWTH FOR MOST OF THESE COUNTRIES, SUGGESTING THAT HELMKE AND LEVITSKY (2004)'S FRAMEWORK HAS LIMITATIONS. FINALLY, WE CHALLENGE THE NOTION OF ASIAN PARADOX STATES, AS COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF ASIA ALSO QUALIFY AS THE PARADOX STATES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE NOT MUCH EMPIRICAL EFFORT HAS EXAMINED HOW DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INFORMAL AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS CAN EXPLAIN GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY ACROSS COUNTRIES. WE SHOW THAT DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL PATTERNS EXPLAIN GROWTH ACROSS THE PARADOX STATES AND NON-PARADOX STATES.
97	DEMOCRACY AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM IS MAINTAINED THROUGH PARTY REPRESENTATION AND ELECTION IN WHICH EVERYBODY IS DULY REPRESENTED, AND THROUGH A CONSTITUTION WHICH IS PREPARED IN THE INTEREST OF EQUITY, JUSTICE AND EGALITARIANISM, AND THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW WHICH DOES NOT PERMIT ANY FORM OF PREFERENTIAL OR PARTIAL TREATMENT AND JUDGEMENT. IN NIGERIA, DEMOCRACY CAME INTO REAL EXISTENCE ON 29 MAY 1999. COINCIDENTALLY, SHARIA, WHICH IS THE THEOCRATIC LEGAL SYSTEM OF ISLAM, WAS ADOPTED IN ZAMFARA STATE FOLLOWED BY SOME OTHER STATES OF THE COUNTRY ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME. THIS ARTICLE IS AIMED AT A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SOCIO-RELIGIOUS IMPLICATIONS OF THE PRACTICE OF THEOCRACY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF SHARIA AS STATE LAW IN THE DEMOCRATIC NATION, NIGERIA. AN ATTEMPT AT INTERPRETING AND PROFFERING SOLUTIONS TO THE DESTABILISING EFFECTS OF THE ADOPTION OF SHARIA IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM PROVIDED BY THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY IS MADE. THIS RESEARCH ADOPTED A HISTORICAL APPROACH AND WAS DEPENDENT ON BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES. THE RESULT INDICATES THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE 'ADOPTION AND PRACTICE OF SHARIA IN SOME STATES OF NIGERIA ARE MANIFEST IN LEGAL DUALITY, RELIGIOUS PARTIALITY AND SOCIAL INSTABILITY.' THIS ARTICLE, THEREFORE, RECOMMENDS FOR THE COUNTRY A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF POLITICAL RESTRUCTURING, NAMELY, THAT RELIGION SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM POLITICS.
98	THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, UNDER A REGIONAL MATRIX AND A METROPOLIS-COLONY LOGIC, RAISES AND PERPASSES SOME RELATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVING EMPIRE IDEAS, EMPIRE LAWS, THE RULE OF LAW, LEGAL TRANSPLANT THEORY TRANSPLANTS) AND THE SCHOOL LAW AND DEVELOPMENT. THE QUESTION THAT ARISES IS: HOW CAN WE ESTABLISH AND DEVISE A MODEL OF EMANCIPATORY (DECOLONIAL) ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BASED ON THE REGION'S OWN NEEDS AND INEQUALITIES, IN FACE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF INSTITUTES AND INSTRUMENTS OF ORDERING-MANIPULATION OF ECONOMIC POWER, NOTABLY IN VIEW OF THE CONDITIONALITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF NON-STATE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (WORLD BANK)? THIS IS THE CENTRAL OBJECT OF THE ARTICLE. THE RESEARCH IS EMINENTLY DOCUMENTARY, HAVING AS THEORETICAL REFERENCE THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION THEORY, "LAW AND DEVELOPMENT" AND THE DECOLONIAL DEVELOPMENTAL MATRIX, DEVELOPED BY PROFESSORS WATSON, MATTEI, FRANKENBERG, LOPEZ-MEDINA AND MIGNOLO. THE METHOD OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION, THAT IS, ANALYTICAL SUBSTANTIAL. THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THEORIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL COMPARISON, IN A DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE OF "JURIDICAL FLOWS", TYPICAL OF THE GLOBALIZING NORMATIVE CONTEXT, USING DOCTRINAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE THEORY OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTS CONTEXTUALIZED HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY WITH LATIN AMERICAN REALITY, IN THE PURPOSE OF CONSECRATING IDENTITY AND LEGITIMIZING FOUNDATION OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FINALLY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF MODELS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONSECRATES POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORMS, ENGENDERED BY NON-STATE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.
99	PURPOSE - CHINA'S OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (ODI) HAS BECOME A RECENT PHENOMENON IN THAT CHINA IS NOW RATED AS THE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST COUNTRY FOR ODI. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT CHINA'S ODI IS DRIVEN BY THE ATTRACTIONS OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND OVERSEAS MARKETS. YET THESE STUDIES HAVE IGNORED THE ROLE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, THE PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE KAUFMANN ET AL. (1999) DATA SET IS USED IN OUR STUDY AND THE DATA SAMPLE HAVE COVERED THE PERIOD FROM 2003 TO 2012 FOR A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF 171 HOST COUNTRIES. RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL ARE APPLIED IN THE PAPER AND POPULATION AVERAGE MODEL IS USED TO CHECK THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE EFFECTS OF MACRO-CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ARE DISTINCT IN DIFFERENT SAMPLE PERIODS, AS WELL AS IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ECONOMIC REGIONS, WHEN ATTRACTING CHINA'S ODI. INDICATORS SUCH AS POLITICAL STABILITY, THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, REGULATORY EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE FOUND TO BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO CHINA'S ODI. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST PAPERS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MACRO-CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND CHINA'S ODI. 171 COUNTRIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE DATA SAMPLE AND SUB-SAMPLE TESTS ARE ALSO CONDUCTED.
100	THE LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS IN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN EVER BEFORE. WHY THEN ARE COMPANIES SO VULNERABLE TO LEGAL LIABILITY? THE PROBLEM MAY NOT BE WITH TALENTED LEGAL PROFESSIONALS, BUT WITH THE LACK OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE HELD BY MBAS AND OTHER BUSINESS SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT MAKE DAY-TODAY DECISIONS IN MODERN ORGANIZATIONS. FIRMS CAN CLOSE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP AND MINIMIZE LEGAL LIABILITY BY TRAINING THEIR MANAGERS IN LEGAL ASTUTENESS-THE ABILITY OF A MANAGER TO ADDRESS LEGAL ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY-BY INSTILLING FOUR ESSENTIAL TRAITS: RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW, RECOGNIZING LEGAL ISSUES, RESOLVING PROBLEMS PROACTIVELY, AND REPORTING COMPLEX LEGAL ISSUES TO EXPERTS. JOB CANDIDATES SHOULD ALSO BE SCREENED FOR TRAITS OF LEGAL ASTUTENESS. A LEGALLY ASTUTE CANDIDATE, ESPECIALLY A GRADUATE OF A BUSINESS SCHOOL THAT REQUIRES LEGAL EDUCATION FOR ALL ITS STUDENTS, CAN BE A CULTURAL AMBASSADOR FOR LEGAL ASTUTENESS AND A VALUABLE LIAISON BETWEEN LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENTS AND THE CANDIDATE'S FUNCTIONAL AREA. A LEGALLY IGNORANT CANDIDATE WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TRAINING AND A FRANK ASSESSMENT OF THE LEGAL RISK THEY BRING TO THE ORGANIZATION. MODERN FIRMS IN TODAY'S LEGAL ENVIRONMENT FACE TWO CHOICES: HIRE A LEGALLY ASTUTE MANAGER NOW OR DEAL WITH A COMPLIANCE HEADACHE LATER. (C) 2021 KELLEY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, INDIANA UNIVERSITY.

101	TODAY, THE BASIC ROLE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMES) IN DETERMINING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS OBVIOUS FOR ALL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE POLITICAL FACTORS REFER TO THE APPLICATION OF A NESTED SET OF MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POLICIES IN PRACTICE WITHOUT THE INTENDED PROFIT OR THEORETICALLY TRANSPARENT AND PROFITABLE BUT RENT-SEEKING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION METHOD, WHICH IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES FROM THE MICRO PERSPECTIVE AND THE ECONOMY FROM A MACRO PERSPECTIVE. CONSIDERING THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF IRAN IN THE FIELD OF SMES, THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE POLITICAL FACTORS AFFECTING THE SURVIVAL OF SMES. IN THIS REGARD, MORE THAN 300 INDIVIDUALS WERE SELECTED FROM THOSE WITH SMES IN TEHRAN GRAND BAZAAR IN 2018 BY USING A BINARY MODEL. THE LOGIT AND PROBIT REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA, AND EXCEL 2016 AND SHAZAM 11 SOFTWARE PACKAGES WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT AMONG THE VARIABLES AND INDICATORS USED IN THE MODEL AS POLITICAL FACTORS, INTERACTIVE POLICIES (LIPS), THE RULE OF LAW POLICIES (RLPS), AND THE INTERNATIONAL TENSION-RELEASING POLICIES (IPS) SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE FACTOR OF SMES SURVIVAL POLICY IN TEHRAN'S GRAND BAZAAR.

102	PUBLIC LEGAL INFORMATION FROM ALL COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IS PART OF THE COMMON HERITAGE OF HUMANITY. MAXIMIZING ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION PROMOTES JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DECLARATION ON FREE ACCESS TO LAW BY LEGAL INFORMATION INSTITUTES OF THE WORLD, A PLETHORA OF LEGAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INTERNET, WHILE THE PROVISION OF LEGAL INFORMATION HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN EASIER. GIVEN THAT LAW IS ACCESSED BY A MUCH WIDER GROUP OF PEOPLE, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE NOT LEGALLY TRAINED OR QUALIFIED, DIVERSIFICATION TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN THE CONTEXT OF LEGAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, AS TO INCREASE USER SATISFACTION. WE ADDRESS THE DIVERSIFICATION OF RESULTS IN LEGAL SEARCH BY ADOPTING SEVERAL STATE OF THE ART METHODS FROM THE WEB SEARCH, NETWORK ANALYSIS AND TEXT SUMMARIZATION DOMAINS. WE PROVIDE AN EXHAUSTIVE EVALUATION OF THE METHODS, USING A STANDARD DATASET FROM THE COMMON LAW DOMAIN THAT WE OBJECTIVELY ANNOTATED WITH RELEVANCE JUDGMENTS FOR THIS PURPOSE. OUR RESULTS: (I) REVEAL THAT USERS RECEIVE BROADER INSIGHTS ACROSS THE RESULTS THEY GET FROM A LEGAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM; (II) DEMONSTRATE THAT WEB SEARCH DIVERSIFICATION TECHNIQUES OUTPERFORM OTHER APPROACHES (E.G., SUMMARIZATION-BASED, GRAPH-BASED METHODS) IN THE CONTEXT OF LEGAL DIVERSIFICATION; AND (III) OFFER BALANCE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN REINFORCING RELEVANT DOCUMENTS OR SAMPLING THE INFORMATION SPACE AROUND THE LEGAL QUERY.
103	AMERICA'S CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE RELIES ON CHECKS AND BALANCES TO PREVENT A CONCENTRATION OF EXCESSIVE DISCRETIONARY POWER IN THE HANDS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIAL OR BODY, PROMOTING EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT WHILE PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND STATE SOVEREIGNTY. FEDERAL COURTS HAVE BEEN SENSITIVE TO THREATS TO UPEND THIS BALANCE OF POWER WHERE ONE BRANCH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTRUDES ON POWERS ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER, BUT LESS SO TO CHANGES THAT INCREASE FEDERAL POWER OVERALL INCLUDING, NOTABLY, UNCHECKED DISCRETIONARY POWER OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS. AN ELASTIC COMMERCE CLAUSE AND INEFFECTIVE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE LEAVE JUDICIAL REVIEW AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SAFEGUARD, EFFECTIVELY THE LAW'S LAST CHANCE FOR RESTRAINING OFFICIAL ACTION. THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE, HOWEVER, AS IT HAS OFTEN BEEN DEPLOYED, GRANTS DEFERENCE TO A LARGE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS ON A FICTIVE SUPPOSITION THAT CONGRESS INTENTIONALLY CONFERRED DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY FOR THOSE ACTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE DOCTRINE IS DEFENDED, REASONABLY, AS CONSTRAINING A DIFFERENT SORT OF DISCRETIONARY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY RESTING IN THE HANDS OF JUDGES RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATORS CHEVRON DEFERENCE HAS REDUCED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AS A LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE POWER. THIS ESSAY ADDRESSES THE CHANGES IN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON OFFICIAL POWER, THE FUNCTION OF THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE, AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES AS A CHECK ON DISCRETIONARY ADMINISTRATIVE POWER. IT CONCLUDES THAT A STRONGER REQUIREMENT OF ACTUAL GRANTS OF DISCRETION IS MORE LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE AND MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
104	IN THE 2008 AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL BUDGET, TREASURER WAYNE SWAN ANNOUNCED A COMPREHENSIVE 'ROOT AND BRANCH' REVIEW OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAX SYSTEM TO HELP CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE TAX SYSTEM. THIS REVIEW IS NOW UNDERWAY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A PIVOTAL PART OF THE REVIEW IS CLARIFYING AND OUTLINING HOW A TAX WILL BE EVALUATED BECAUSE THIS FUNCTIONS AS THE CONTEXT FOR THE EVALUATION AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE OVERALL CONCLUSION THAT IS REACHED. THE CENTRAL PROPOSITION ADVANCED IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT A MULTI-STAGED, INTEGRATED EVALUATIVE FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE CREATED TO EVALUATE TAX REFORM MEASURES. THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CRITERIA ENDORSED IN THE CONSULTATION PAPER FOR THE REVIEW AS POTENTIAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES THAT CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE A TAXATION MEASURE AND SUGGESTS A FURTHER KEY CRITERION THAT SHOULD BE USED - THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND PART OF THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS AND TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN THE CRITERIA TO PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR PRIORITISING EACH PRINCIPLE IN ESTABLISHING THE FRAMEWORK. THE THIRD PART OF THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS AN INTEGRATED EVALUATION FRAMEWORK, BY DEFINING THE THREE STAGES AT WHICH A TAX CAN BE EVALUATED: POLICY, DRAFTING AND ADMINISTRATION AND SPECIFYING WHICH OF THE CRITERIA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AT EACH STAGE AND ATTRIBUTING A PRIORITY TO EACH OF THE CRITERIA.
105	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF JEWISH EMANCIPATION AND THE REPUBLICAN ORDER OF STATE BY ACTIVISTS OF THE CENTRAL ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN CITIZENS OF THE JEWISH FAITH (CENTRALVEREIN DEUTSCHER STAATSBURGER JUDISCHEN GLAUBENS, CV) IN THE WEIMAR YEARS. IT ARGUES THAT ACTIVISTS ADOPTED A LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PATRIOTISM AND INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A REPUBLICAN NATION-BUILDING PROJECT THAT WENT SUBSTANTIALLY BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL TASKS OF DEFENCE (ABWEHR) AND ENLIGHTENMENT (AUFKLARUNG) AGAINST ANTISEMITISM. THIS ENTAILED RALLYING FELLOW REPUBLICANS TO THE DEFENCE OF THE ORDER OF STATE, ADVOCATING FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND RULE OF LAW AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN SOCIETY. IN DOING SO, THE CV RETHOUGHT WHAT IT MEANT TO BE 'GERMAN' AND CAME TO UNDERSTAND IT IN A DISTINCTIVELY REPUBLICAN FORM, ARGUING THAT IDENTIFICATION WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE REPUBLICAN IDEALS WERE THE TRUEST EXPRESSION OF GERMANNESS. AS 'GERMAN' CAME TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE'S SPIRIT AND WILL, JEWS' BELONGING TO GERMANY WAS SEEN AS THE RESULT OF A TELEOLOGICAL PROCESS OF THE MATERIALIZATION OF THE 'GERMAN SPIRIT', MANIFESTED IN THE REPUBLIC. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE READS THE HISTORY OF THE CENTRALVEREIN DURING THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC NOT ONLY IN REGARD TO ITS ROLE FOR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY BUT CRUCIALLY AS ONE OF THE LIBERAL MOVEMENTS THAT AIMED TO DEVELOP AND DEFEND THE GERMAN REPUBLIC.
106	THE PRESPA AGREEMENT CONCLUDED BETWEEN (NORTH) MACEDONIA AND GREECE IN JUNE 2018 IS HAILED AS A MAJOR SUCCESS FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) POLICY OF PROMOTING CONFLICT RESOLUTION THROUGH IN THE BALKANS AND BEYOND. AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE CASE OF THE SO-CALLED MACEDONIAN NAME DISPUTE, THE EU HINDERED COMPROMISE AS MEMBERSHIP IN THE BLOC PROVIDED ATHENS WITH ASYMMETRIC LEVERAGE OVER SKOPJE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS MADE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION BY EMPOWERING OPPOSITION TO STATE CAPTURE IN MACEDONIA, HELPING RESOLVE A DOMESTIC POLITICAL CRISIS BETWEEN 2015 AND 2017, AND FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO A GOVERNMENT WILLING TO COMPROMISE WITH GREECE. EVEN IF THE PRESPA AGREEMENT RESULTED FROM A BARGAIN BETWEEN ATHENS AND SKOPJE, INTERVENTION IN MACEDONIAN POLITICS BY THE EU, THE UNITED STATES, AND NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN PASSING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AGREED IN THE DEAL. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NAME DISPUTE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EU AS AN AGENT OF CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION, ARGUING THAT EUROPEAN INTEGRATION'S "ENABLING IMPACT" IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLAINING THE GENESIS OF THE PRESPA AGREEMENT. IT ALSO CONTENDS THAT THE EU FACED A DILEMMA BETWEEN THE PURSUIT OF STABILITY AND THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY, OFTEN PRIORITISING THE FORMER OVER THE LATTER.
107	CHINESE FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAVE BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT OVER THE PAST DECADE. THIS TREND, INITIALLY AND LARGELY, WAS INDUCED BY EXTERNAL PRESSURES-ESPECIALLY CHINA'S WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS-AND CHINA IS EXPECTED TO EXHIBIT, IN CONDUCTING FOREIGN AFFAIRS, GREATER TRANSPARENCY AS IT EXERTS GROWING INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCES. IT IS ALSO ENHANCED BY THE IMPROVED RULE OF LAW AND NATIONAL GOVERNANCE IN CHINA, INCLUDING THE OPEN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION REGULATION, CHINA'S FIRST FREEDOM OF INFORMATION (FOI) LAW, ADOPTED IN 2007 AND AMENDED IN 2019. THE RISING NATIONALISM IN CHINA ALSO HAS PLAYED A GROWING ROLE IN THIS REGARD. THE RECORDS OF FOI APPLICATIONS AND FOI APPLICATIONS-RELATED LITIGATION INDICATE THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PUBLIC HAS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THEIR CONCERNS OVER HOW CHINA'S GOVERNMENT CONDUCTS FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ROUSE BITTER HISTORICAL MEMORIES AMONG THE CHINESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE NOT ACTIVE IN USING LEGAL MEANS TO PUSH CHINESE FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT. FURTHERMORE, THEY ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE COURTS IN CHINA, WHICH TEND TO BROADLY INTERPRET THE MEANING OF 'ACTS OF STATE' AND THEREFORE DISMISS THE RELEVANT CASES. IN ADDITION, THE CHINESE COMMUNITY PARTY, AN OVERARCHING POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM IN CHINA, WHILE HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CONDUCTS ITSELF IN AN ACCOUNTABLE MANNER, OFTEN CONSTITUTES A MAJOR HINDRANCE TO THE GREATER TRANSPARENCY OF CHINESE FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
108	BASED ON THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD AND A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN THE VOTE OF MINISTER BARROSO, IN HABEAS CORPUS N O. 124/306/2016-STF, FOR THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION IN THE FIRST-TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY. WE START FROM THE OBSERVATION THAT THERE ARE NO CONVINCING BIOETHICAL REASONS TO CONSIDER THE LIFE OF THE FETUS ONLY AS "POTENTIAL" IN THIS PERIOD, RECOGNIZING THAT HUMAN LIFE AND THE RIGHT THAT PROTECTS IT DO NOT DEPEND ON A SUBJECTIVE CHOICE, BUT ON OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC DATA. TO UNDERSTAND THE DISCRETION OF THIS VOTE, WE REFLECT ON THE THEORY IT REFERS AS ITS FOUNDATION, THE NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM, BASED ON CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND ON ALEXY'S LEGAL ARGUMENTATION THEORY, AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTION OF COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN DEMOCRACY, WHICH PRIVILEGES THE JUDICIARY, IN THE POST- POSITIVIST CONTEXT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE JUDICIALIZATION OF LIFE. WE ALSO ANALYZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM OVERCOMES POSITIVIST DISCRETION AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE FACE OF REASONABLE MORAL DISAGREEMENTS, AS MINISTER BARROSO CONSIDERS ABORTION TO BE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MINISTER'S ARGUMENT IS DISCRETIONARY AND MARKED BY CONTRADICTIONS AND FALLACIES, RESULTING IN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM THAT MORALIZES AND DEPOLITICIZES THE LAW, THREATENING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW.
109	BENEFITING FROM THE PROGRESS OF TECHNOLOGY, TERRORISM POSES A MAJOR THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. TERRORIST ACTS MIGHT MOVE TO OTHER FORMS AND ARE THE CULMINATION OF PROCESSES THAT OFTEN BEGIN WITH RADICALIZATION, THE FORMATION OF EXTREMIST VIEWS, AND ACCEPTANCE OF VIOLENCE AS A MEANS THROUGH WHICH TO ATTEMPT CHANGE. AS WITH OTHER TYPES OF OFFENSES, THERE IS NO INTERNATIONALLY AGREED UPON DEFINITION OF TERRORISM, BUT SEVERAL CONDUCTS ARE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED AS EXPRESSIONS THEREOF. TERRORIST-RELATED OFFENSES INCLUDE THE USE OF VIOLENCE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES, SUCH AS THE HIJACKING OF AIRCRAFT, TARGETING OF MARINE VESSELS, THE USE OF CHEMICAL OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST CIVILIANS, KIDNAPPING, AND OTHER FORMS OF TARGETING CIVILIANS. TERRORISM ITSELF IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON, YET THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY IS BEING SHAPED BY A MORE INTENSE FOCUS ON THE ISSUE AND AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF TERRORIST ACTS AND GROUPS. IF TERRORISM IN OUTER SPACE BECAME A REALITY, THEN THE CAUSE IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FORMS OF TERRORISM IN THAT VIOLENT EXTREMISM IS OFTEN DRIVEN BY FEELINGS OF ISOLATION AND EXCLUSION, AS WELL AS FEAR AND IGNORANCE. TO STRENGTHEN A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION, RESPONSES TO VIOLENT EXTREMISM MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN A FRAMEWORK RESPECTFUL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW; OTHERWISE, THE EXCLUSION IS EXACERBATED, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL WITNESS ANOTHER FORM OF CHAOS.
110	IN THE LONG PROCESS OF EVOLUTION OF EUROPEAN LAW AND STATE, THE PROBLEM OF THE SUCCESSION OF NORMS OVER TIME HAS RECEIVED VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSES. AT THE PRESENT TIME IT MUST BE ADDRESSED WITHIN EACH OF THE LEGAL SYSTEMS AS A MATTER OF POSITIVE LAW. WITH THESE PREMISES, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE HOW THE PROBLEM OF THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE LAW - ITS FOUNDATION AND ITS LIMITS - HAS CHANGED - THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION OF EUROPEAN LAW AND STATE - IN THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF THE DEROGATORY PHENOMENON. PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT ARISE WITH ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES UNTIL THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE LAW COULD NOT AFFECT THE PAST BECAUSE IT WAS A PRODUCT OF HISTORY, IT IS THE TIME OF THE JURISDICTIONAL STATE THAT EXTENDS FROM THE EMERGENCE OF THE FIRST EUROPEAN STATES UNTIL THE REVOLUTION. IN A SECOND STAGE, THAT OF THE RULE OF LAW WITH ITS LIBERAL CONSTITUTION, THE RETROACTIVITY OF THE LAW HAD A CLEAR FOUNDATION: ITS SOVEREIGN CHARACTER AND DEFINED IDEOLOGICAL LIMITS - LEGAL SECURITY AND ACQUIRED RIGHTS - ALTHOUGH LEGALLY INEFFECTIVE GIVEN LEGISLATIVE OMNIPOTENCE. IN A THIRD STAGE, THAT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE WITH ITS DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION, THE FOUNDATION AND LIMITS OF RETROACTIVITY CHANGE. RETROACTIVITY IS NOW BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE AND FINDS ITS LIMIT IN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
111	CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROVISION OF SECURITY IS OFTEN PRESENTED AS A WIN-WIN WAY TO RELIEVE PRESSURE ON POLICE RESOURCES WHILE BUILDING STRONGER, MORE RESPONSIBLE AND DEMOCRATICALLY ENGAGED COMMUNITIES. GOVERNMENTS IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE ADOPTED A 'STRATEGY OF RESPONSIBILISATION' DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE, ENABLE AND SUPPORT CITIZENS TO TAKE ON TASKS OTHERWISE LEFT FOR POLICE. YET, THIS STRATEGY CONSPICUOUSLY IGNORES THE GROWING NUMBER OF CITIZEN-LED DIGITAL POLICING INITIATIVES WHICH OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OR GUIDANCE OF POLICE. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TREND FOR DEMOCRATIC NORMS IN POLICING. IT USES THE PHENOMENON OF SELF-STYLED PAEDOPHILE HUNTERS - WHICH ARE NOW ACTIVE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD - AS A CASE STUDY. THE ARTICLE MAKES COMPARISONS BETWEEN SUCH INITIATIVES AND OTHER, RELATIVELY WELL-THEORISED INFORMAL SECURITY PROVIDERS, SUCH AS VIGILANTE GROUPS AND CIVILIAN POLICING. IT ARGUES THAT, LIKE VIGILANTES, CITIZEN-LED DIGITAL POLICE OFTEN CHALLENGE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. YET, LIKE OTHER CIVILIAN POLICING INITIATIVES, THEY INCREASE EMPOWERMENT AND PARTICIPATION, AND RELY FOR THEIR SUCCESS ON THE PRESENCE OF STRONG AND LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS OF JUSTICE, TO WHICH THEY ULTIMATELY DEFER. THESE CHARACTERISTICS PRESENT A DISCREET SET OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR CONTEMPORARY POLICING, WHICH THIS ARTICLE ARGUES CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY STRATEGIC POLICE ENGAGEMENT.
112	THIS ARTICLE MAINTAINS THAT THE STANDARD CONCEPTION OF LEGAL ETHICS - THE SO-CALLED 'THEORY OF AMORALITY' - IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CONTEXT AND CANNOT BE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED TO TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL PRACTICE. AFTER DEFINING IN SOME DETAIL THE BASIC TENETS OF THE STANDARD CONCEPTION, I IDENTIFY ITS MAIN ASSUMPTIONS, NAMELY, (I) THAT A LEGAL RELATION IS AN AGENCY RELATION IN WHICH BOTH LAWYER AND CLIENT ARE INDIVIDUAL MORAL AGENTS, (II) THAT SUCH RELATION IS CONNECTED TO A LITIGATION PROCESS, AND (III) THAT SUCH RELATION TAKES PLACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DECENTLY WELL-FUNCTIONING RULE OF LAW SYSTEM. USING AS A PARADIGMATIC EXAMPLE THE BTC PIPELINE CASE- A SET OF CONTRACTS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES SIGNED BY A CONSORTIUM OF PRIVATE COMPANIES AND SEVERAL SOVEREIGN STATES DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF THE 21ST CENTURY TO REGULATE THE BUILDING AND OPERATION OF A TRANSNATIONAL OIL PIPELINE - I ANALYZE ONE BY ONE THESE THREE ASSUMPTIONS TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY ARE AT THE VERY LEAST HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL LEGAL PRACTICE. ADDITIONALLY, I CONSIDER THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT THAT A LAWYER WHO MOVES BEYOND THE STANDARD CONCEPTION IS ACTUALLY USURPING THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE, AN ARGUMENT THAT LOSES MUCH OF ITS APPEAL ON THE TRANSNATIONAL CONTEXT. IN A BRIEF CONCLUDING REMARK I INSCRIBE THESE PROBLEMS WITHIN THE MORE GENERAL POST-WESTPHALIAN PARADIGM SHIFT IN LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE.
113	SINCE THE END OF THE 1980S IN INDIA, GROUPS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES, RELIGIONS, REGIONS AND CASTES HAVE COME TO REGULARLY ATTACK ARTISTS AND DAMAGE ARTWORKS. STRAINING RELATIONS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES CONCOMITANT WITH THE DECLINE OF SECULARISM - AS A PRACTICE IF NOT AS A NORM - IN INDIAN POLITICS PROVIDES THE CONTEXT FOR SUCH COMPETITIVE AND VIOLENT PROCLAMATIONS OF 'HURT SENTIMENTS.' HOWEVER, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE COMPLEMENTARY EXPLANATIONS OF HOW THE RULE OF LAW HAS ALSO COME TO NOT APPEAR AS A STRAIGHTFORWARD 'SOLUTION' TO THIS 'PROBLEM.' IT SHOWS THE FRAGILITY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH AND EXPRESSION IN INDIA TODAY, WHERE THE SHIFTING LEGAL REGIME IS HARDLY AN ASSURANCE AGAINST THE CONCRETE ALTERNATIVES OF LETHAL THREATS AND VIOLENCE, WHICH HAVE LEGITIMIZED, OVER TIME, AS PRATAP BHANU MEHTA HAS ARGUED, 'THE INSIDIOUS IDEA THAT IT WAS NOT THE STATE'S JOB TO PROTECT FREEDOM, BUT TO DISCIPLINE THAT FREEDOM IN THE NAME OF SOME CONCEPTION OF PROPRIETY' (MEHTA, 2012). TO BE SURE, THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER IS NOT TO SLAM VIGILANT, AND EVEN, AS MANY WOULD ARGUE, NECESSARY LAWS AND REGULATORY BODIES, BUT TO EXPLORE HOW THE LEGAL REASONING AND WORKINGS MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY COME TO BE A RATIONAL CHOICE FOR OFFENCE-TAKERS, TO DEVELOP THEORETICALLY AND APPLY PRACTICALLY IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS.
114	THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES' STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THE CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 'ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY LEVEL' REPRESENTING STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND SIX INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS REVEALED BY THE WORLD BANK (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, REGULATION QUALITY, VOIVE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) WAS INVESTIGATED VIA DUMITRESCU-HURLIN CAUSALITY TEST FOR BOTH E-7 AND G-7 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD OF 1996-2017. THE RESEARCH QUESTION OF THE STUDY IS THAT WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AMONG DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTION AND CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. ON THIS PURPOSE, E-7 COUNTRY GROUP IS SELECTED TO REPRESENT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHEREAS G-7 COMMUNITY IS SELECTED TO REPRESENT DEVELOPED ONE. AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN E-7 COUNTRIES COMPRISED OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DISPLAYED GREATER CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIPS WITH ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY LEVEL REPRESENTING STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION IN COMPARISON WITH G-7 COUNTRIES. BESIDES, CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS THEMSELVES ARE ALSO GREATER IN E-7 COUNTRIES THAN G-7 COUNTRIES. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE IN COMPARISON TO DEVELOPED ONES. THAT'S WHY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE REQUIRED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS WITH GREATER RIGOROUSLY.
115	FAST TRACK LAND REFORM IN MOST INSTANCES HAS BEEN TREATED AS A PROCESS ONLY ENTAILING THE REDISTRIBUTION OF FORMERLY WHITE-OWNED LAND TO BLACKS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHER DEEPER CHANGES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN COHERENTLY ANALYSED, SUCH AS THE NATURE OF LOCAL POWER RELATIONS AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM; ESPECIALLY THE MANNER IN WHICH IT BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF TRADITIONAL AUTHORITY AND ELECTED AUTHORITIES. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM IN FAST TRACK AREAS IS IN A STATE OF FLUX. ON THE ONE HAND, THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE AND PARTICIPATORY MODEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, HOWEVER, OFFICIAL PROCESSES THROUGH LEGAL ENACTMENTS SUGGEST THAT POLICY CRAFTSMEN ARE STILL INTENT ON CONTINUING WITH POLICIES THAT PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TWO COMPETING SITES OF POWER. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE MANNER IN WHICH RURAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN TREATED IN THE LITERATURE, AND HOW IT IS BEING RE-ESTABLISHED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 'JAMBANJA', A PERIOD IN WHICH THE 'RULE OF LAW' WAS LITERALLY SUSPENDED. RATHER THAN DEPENDING ONLY ON OFFICIAL PROCESSES, THE FIELD EVIDENCE THAT ANALYSES THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO UTILISED. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS A MORE COHERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINKS BETWEEN THE COLONIAL STATE'S CONTROL IMPERATIVE AND THE POST-COLONIAL'S AMBITION TO EXERT SIMILAR CONTROL, ALBEIT UNDER DIFFERENT POLITICAL CONDITIONS.
116	MANFRED G. SCHMIDT, PUBLIC POLICY IN AUTOCRACIES AND DEMOCRACIES, PP. 418-437. CAN DEMOCRACIES REALLY PRIDE THEMSELVES OF A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN POLITICAL PERFORMANCE OVER AUTOCRACIES? A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND AN ANALYSIS OF RECENT COMPARATIVE DATA ON PUBLIC POLICY IN DEMOCRATIC AND AUTOCRATIC NATIONS SUGGEST FIVE MAIN FINDINGS. CONVENTIONAL COMPARISONS WITH A BIVARIATE FRAMEWORK, SUCH AS THE "DEMOCRACY ADVANTAGE"-HYPOTHESIS SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL PERFORMANCE IN NON-DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES, IS IN GENERAL SUPERIOR TO AUTOCRACIES. HOWEVER, STUDIES BASED ON MORE SOPHISTICATED, MULTIVARIATE RESEARCH DESIGNS SUGGESTS THAT AT LEAST A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN PUBLIC POLICY IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FACTORS OTHER THAN DEMOCRACY PER SE, SUCH AS RULE OF LAW AND A HIGH LEVEL OF WEALTH. A SIGNIFICANT DEMOCRACY ADVANTAGE CHARACTERIZES ONLY A LIMITED GROUP OF COUNTRIES. THIS GROUP IS MAINLY COMPOSED OF ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES. MOREOVER, PERFORMANCE LEVELS VARY BOTH WITHIN DEMOCRACIES AND AUTOCRACIES. THE CAUSES OF THE VARIATIONS RESIDES AT LEAST PARTLY IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEFECTIVE AND NON DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES AND MIRRORS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPES OF AUTOCRACIES, WITH THE DIVISION BETWEEN AUTHORITARIAN AND TOTALITARIAN RULE, BETWEEN CIVILIAN AUTOCRACIES AND MILITARY REGIMES, AND BETWEEN OIL-EXPORTING STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS MAJOR EXAMPLES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS CHAPTER ARE, HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY BECAUSE SYSTEMATIC COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON PUBLIC POLICIES IN DEMOCRACIES AND AUTOCRACIES IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY.
117	STARTING WITH THE EUROPEAN SECURITY STRATEGY (ESS) IN 2003 THE EUROPEAN UNION REITERATED THAT SECURITY, STABILITY, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN ITS NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE KEY FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES. IN CONSIDERATION OF NEW KINDS OF SECURITY THREATS, SUCH AS ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND VARIOUS FORMS OF TERRORIST ACTS IN THE SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN, WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING AN ON-GOING EXTERNALISATION OF SECURITY COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS (JHA) WITH THIRD COUNTRIES IN THE REGION AND BEYOND. IN TERMS OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION, FRONTEX ACTS AS THE MAIN INSTRUMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF EUROPE'S BORDER. THIS BORDER CONTROL AGENCY AIMS AT CURBING ILLEGAL MIGRATION IN COOPERATION WITH THIRD COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER IT IS A FURTHER STEP IN DEEPENING THE CHRONIC DEFICIT OF COHERENCE IN EU FOREIGN POLICY. BY EXTERNALISING SECURITY COOPERATION THE EU CONTRADICTS ITS POLICIES IN THE FIELDS OF DEMOCRACY PROMOTION, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH ARE BASED ON THE EU'S SELF-PERCEPTION AS A NORMATIVE POWER. THUS, THE FOLLOWING PAPER STRESSES THREE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRADICTIONS OF EU POLICY ON ILLEGAL MIGRATION: FIRST, EU POLICY CONTRADICTS ITS OWN EFFORTS IN DEMOCRACY PROMOTION, SECOND, EU POLICY IS IN BREACH OF EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THIRD, THE EU SEEMS TO PREFER A SHORT-TERM APPROACH TO A LONG-TERM EFFORT THAT TACKLES THE ROOT CAUSES OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION IN THE SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN.
118	BASED ON THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD AND A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN THE VOTE OF MINISTER BARROSO, IN HABEAS CORPUS N DEGREES. 124/306/2016-STF, FOR THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION IN THE FIRST-TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY. WE START FROM THE OBSERVATION THAT THERE ARE NO CONVINCING BIOETHICAL REASONS TO CONSIDER THE LIFE OF THE FETUS ONLY AS "POTENTIAL" IN THIS PERIOD, RECOGNIZING THAT HUMAN LIFE AND THE RIGHT THAT PROTECTS IT DO NOT DEPEND ON A SUBJECTIVE CHOICE, BUT ON OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC DATA. TO UNDERSTAND THE DISCRETION OF THIS VOTE, WE REFLECT ON THE THEORY IT REFERS AS ITS FOUNDATION, THE NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM, BASED ON CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND ON ALEXY'S LEGAL ARGUMENTATION THEORY, AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTION OF COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN DEMOCRACY, WHICH PRIVILEGES THE JUDICIARY, IN THE POST-POSITIVIST CONTEXT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE JUDICIALIZATION OF LIFE. WE ALSO ANALYZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM OVERCOMES POSITIVIST DISCRETION AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE FACE OF REASONABLE MORAL DISAGREEMENTS, AS MINISTER BARROSO CONSIDERS ABORTION TO BE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MINISTER'S ARGUMENT IS DISCRETIONARY AND MARKED BY CONTRADICTIONS AND FALLACIES, RESULTING IN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM THAT MORALIZES AND DEPOLITICIZES THE LAW, THREATENING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW.
119	WHEN THE FIRST WORLD WAR BROKE OUT, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT DECLARED THE RETURN OF ALSACE-LORRAINE ITS ONLY PUBLIC WAR AIM, ARGUING THAT THE POPULATION WAS 'FRENCH IN SPIRIT'. IN AN AGE RIFE WITH CLAIMS OF NATIONAL SELF-DETERMINATION, TRAPPED IN A PROTRACTED WAR OF ATTRITION AND FACING A NATIONALLY AMBIVALENT POPULATION, THE GERMAN STATE SOON CAME UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE TO ENSURE THE LOYALTY AND PATRIOTISM OF THE INHABITANTS OF ITS WESTERN BORDERLAND. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHY IMPERIAL GERMANY FAILED TO MEET THIS 'STRESS TEST'. IT FOCUSES ON THE CRUCIAL BUT HITHERTO NEGLECTED ISSUE OF PROTECTIVE CUSTODY (SCHUTZHAFT), WHEREBY POLICE AND MILITARY AUTHORITIES WERE ABLE TO ARREST AND DETAIN 'SUSPECT' CIVILIANS WITHOUT CHARGE OR TRIAL. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT PROTECTIVE CUSTODY, AN EMERGENCY MEASURE UNDER MARTIAL LAW, PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE FAILURE OF GERMAN POLICY IN ALSACE-LORRAINE: IT UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW, SHIFTED THE FOCUS ONTO NATIONAL DISSENT AND GAVE RISE TO AN ATMOSPHERE OF SUSPICION AND FEAR. THE ARTICLE ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THE REICHSTAG SUCCESSFULLY PUT LIMITS ON PROTECTIVE CUSTODY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE WAR. YET LEAVING THE AUTHORITARIAN DOCTRINE OF ENFORCING NATIONAL LOYALTY IN PLACE, THE MORE LENIENT ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH HAD A DISINTEGRATIVE RATHER THAN A STABILIZING EFFECT, PREPARING THE GROUND FOR WIDESPREAD DISAFFECTION WITH GERMAN RULE MONTHS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED.
120	THE ECOWAS COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN FACING WEAK ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN RECENT DECADES. WHILE THE ROLE OF INVESTMENT AS AN ENGINE OF GROWTH IS UNDENIABLE, THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT REMAINS LESS CLEAR. THE ROLE OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TWOFOLD. ON THE ONE HAND, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ANALYZE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND GROWTH IN THE ECOWAS COUNTRIES. TO THIS END, WE USE AN ERROR CORRECTION MODEL (ECM) ON PANEL DATA FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2016. WE PRIVILEGED THE POOLED MEAN GROUP (PMG) ESTIMATOR IN THIS STUDY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ECOWAS COUNTRIES IN THE LONG-TERM. MOREOVER, GOVERNANCE IMPROVES THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. PARTICULARLY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW REPRESENT INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS, WHICH AMPLIFY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT ON GROWTH IN THESE COUNTRIES. THUS, THE IMPROVEMENT OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND INCREASING PUBLIC INVESTMENT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THE PROMOTION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT SHOULD ACCOMPANY ANY GOVERNANCE REFORM AND INCREASE IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH.
121	THE STRUCTURES THAT REGULATE AND SUPPORT THE AUSTRALIAN JUDICIARY REFLECT AND SERVE THE TRADITIONAL JUDICIAL VALUES OF INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. YET MODERN SOCIETY PLACES EMPHASIS ON AN ADDITIONAL RANGE OF VALUES THAT ARE EXPECTED OF GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THESE CONTEMPORARY VALUES INCLUDE DIVERSITY, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFICIENCY. REFORMS TO INTRODUCE REGULATORY AND SUPPORT STRUCTURES THAT PRIORITISE AND FACILITATE THESE VALUES IN THE JUDICIAL ARM HAS PROVED CHALLENGING AND, SOMETIMES, CONTENTIOUS. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A SURVEY OF AUSTRALIAN JUDICIAL OFFICERS (N = 142) FROM ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED WHAT THEY CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST PRESSING CHALLENGES THAT FACE THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF THE AUSTRALIAN JUDICIARY, AND WHETHER THE CURRENT REGULATORY AND SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT ACHIEVES INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE. THE RESPONSES PROVIDE A NUANCED PICTURE OF THE STATE OF THE MODERN AUSTRALIAN JUDICIARY AS IT APPEARS TO THOSE WITHIN IT. THE STUDY FACILITATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH JUDICIAL OFFICERS ARE SATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND, WHERE THEY ARE DISSATISFIED, THE NATURE OF THEIR DISQUIET. WHILE NOT SEEKING TO OFFER COMPLETE RESOLUTIONS TO THE MANY ISSUES CANVASSED, THE DATA AND ANALYSIS PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE SERVE AS AN INTERRUPTION TO REGULATORY AND ACADEMIC STUDIES OF THE AUSTRALIAN JUDICIARY, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ILLUMINATE AND RE-ORIENTATE THE REFORM CONVERSATION IN LIGHT OF THE JUDICIAL PERSPECTIVE ON THESE VARIOUS ISSUES.
122	THE END OF THE COLD WAR TRIGGERED THE SPREAD OF MULTIPARTY POLITICS ACROSS THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES ARGUED THIS FORM OF GOVERNANCE WOULD ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. HOWEVER, IN THE RECENT PAST A WORRISOME TREND HAS EMERGED WHERE THESE GLOBAL POWERS SUPPORT OPPOSITION LEADERS IN ORDER TO OUST LEGITIMATE BUT ANTAGONISTIC ELECTED LEADERS IN FOREIGN. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THIS POLITICAL CHANGE IS ENGINEERED IN WANTON DISREGARD OF THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION AND THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS GEOPOLITICAL CONUNDRUM IS PORTRAYED BY THE PURPORTED OUSTING OF PRESIDENT VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH OF UKRAINE IN 2014 AND MOST RECENTLY PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO IN VENEZUELA. DESPITE BEING THE DULY ELECTED LEADERS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES, THEY WERE ILLEGITIMATELY OUSTED OPPOSITION LEADERS SUPPORTED BY WESTERN POWERS. IN THE SAME VEIN, THESE POLITICAL CHANGES USUALLY INITIATED USING FORCE CONTRARY TO THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND OTHER RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. FURTHERMORE, THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) HAS ESTABLISHED A CONCRETE BODY OF JURISPRUDENCE ON THIS SUBJECT MATTER THOUGH THE SAME IS YET TO BE CODIFIED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. BROADLY SPEAKING, THIS PAPER ARGUES THIS PRACTICE IS UNEQUIVOCALLY ILLEGAL AND EQUIVALENT TO INFRINGEMENT UPON THE SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF THESE COUNTRIES.
123	ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF AUGUSTINE'S POLITICAL THOUGHT IS HIS USE OF IMPERIAL POWER TO COERCE RELIGIOUS DISSENTERS. WHILE SCHOLARS HAVE SOUGHT TO SITUATE AUGUSTINE'S JUSTIFICATIONS OF COERCION WITHIN HIS HISTORICAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS, EVEN THE MOST HELPFUL APPROACHES DO NOT ALLEVIATE CONCERNS THAT AUGUSTINE'S DEFENSE OF COERCION VIOLATES INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MANY DEFENDERS AND DETRACTORS TEND TO VIEW AUGUSTINE'S DEFENSE THROUGH A LARGELY LIBERAL LENS, ASSUMING A MODERN CONCEPTION OF LIBERTY AND LEGITIMACY THAT IS ALIEN TO HIS LATE ANTIQUE CONTEXT. IN CONTRAST, THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS HOW AUGUSTINE APPROPRIATES REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES FROM HIS ROMAN PREDECESSORS TO JUSTIFY COERCION AND PLACE LIMITS ON ITS USE. IN PARTICULAR, IT FOCUSES ON AUGUSTINE'S COMMITMENTS TO: (1) LIBERTY AS NON-DOMINATION; (2) LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS CONSTRAINTS ON ARBITRARY POWER; AND (3) CONTESTABILITY, PUBLICITY, AND IMMANENT CRITIQUE AS MEANS OF PREVENTING DOMINATION AND HOLDING POWER ACCOUNTABLE. BY SHOWING HOW THE CONTENT AND FORM OF AUGUSTINE'S REASONING ALIGN WITH REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT HIS DEFENSE OF COERCION APPEARS LESS INIMICAL TO LIBERTY IN HIS ROMAN CONTEXT THAN HIS MODERN INTERPRETERS TYPICALLY ASSUME. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING HOW THIS REPUBLICAN APPROACH MIGHT HELP TO PRESERVE LIBERTY AND PREVENT DOMINATION IN OUR OWN TIME.
124	OUR COUNTRY HAS FOLLOWED A CLEAR TREND TOWARDS THE RECOGNITION OF VARIOUS MECHANISMS OF CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. A FEW YEARS AGO, IF, FOR INSTANCE, A PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE, CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CAUSED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FACTORY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD, REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHORITIES, SUCH REQUEST WOULD HAVE MOST LIKELY BEEN REJECTED. AT PRESENT, THERE IS A CLEAR LAW-MAKING POLICY TOWARDS ACKNOWLEDGING THE POSSIBILITY FOR A DIVERSITY OF SOCIAL PLAYERS TO BE INVOLVED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. IN A STATE STRUCTURED UNDER A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, BOTH COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND CIVIL SOCIETY ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN POSSESSION OF THE STATE, REGARDING ISSUES THAT MAY AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT, ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. BOTH CONCEPTS, INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATION, MUST GO HAND IN HAND, AS THE FIRST OPERATES AS A CONDITION TO EXERCISE THE SECOND. CIVIL SOCIETY INVOLVEMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE COULD NEVER OCCUR IF, FOR INSTANCE, INFORMATION HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT MADE AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION TO PROTECTING FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, THESE CONCEPTS ARE ENSHRINED IN PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. THEY ALSO ENABLE CIVIL SOCIETY TO BE INVOLVED IN ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION ISSUES. THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A DETAILED RESEARCH ON THE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS ENSHRINING CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
125	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN CHINESE JUSTICE MAY TAKE THE SHAPE OF ASSESSORS SITTING ALONGSIDE PROFESSIONAL JUDGES, OR, AS IT IS SOMETIMES THE CASE ON AN EXPERIMENTAL BASIS, OF THE INTRODUCTION OF A PEOPLE'S JURY IN LOCAL COURTS. YET, THESE FORMS OF PARTICIPATION DO NOT ALTER THE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE: THE LACK OF LEGAL AUTONOMY OF LAW, AND THE LACK OF INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES WITH RESPECT TO THE POLITICAL AUTHORITY. THESE REMAIN THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO THE EXTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IN FACT, THE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF ASSESSORS AND JURORS HAVE FAILED TO LEGITIMATE THE JUDICIAL POWER THROUGH PARTICIPATION AND TRANSPARENCY. EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN, ON THE CONTRARY, THAT ASSESSORS AND JURORS REMAIN FULLY SUBORDINATE TO PROFESSIONAL JUDGES, WHO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONTROLLING HAND OVER THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. NEVERTHELESS CHINESE CITIZENS, ALONG WITH THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN TRIALS, ARE NOT DUPED BY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. ONCE THE LIMITS OF THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF ASSESSORS AND JURORS BECOMES APPARENT, THE QUESTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND JUDICIAL AUTHORITY WILL INEVITABLY BE POSED ANEW. THE REPLY TO THE QUESTION WILL BE EVEN MORE PRESSING, SINCE IT WILL NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE TO USE THE SAME SUBTERFUGE. THAT IS WHY CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN JUSTICE IS SO CRUCIAL IN A CHINA IN SEARCH OF DEMOCRACY.
126	WHAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH A COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IMPACT AGGREGATE VOTING BEHAVIOR IN A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE? MORE SPECIFICALLY, ARE CITIZENS IN SOME COUNTRIES MORE INCLINED VOTE ON THE BASIS OF 'QUALITY' OR 'MERIT' OVER 'FRIENDSHIP' OR 'LOYALTY', AND IF SO, WHY? THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS HOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH A COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPARTIAL (TREATS ALL CITIZENS EQUALLY, FREE FROM CORRUPTION, STRONG RULE OF LAW) IMPACT AGGREGATE CITIZEN BEHAVIOR. WHEN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE (LESS) IMPARTIAL, SUCCESS IN SOCIETY IS MORE OFTEN ON THE BASIS OF MERIT (PATRIMONIAL TIES). THIS TEST CASES IS VOTING IN THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST (ESC) FROM 1975 TO 2012 AMONG PAIRS AND BLOCS OF 'VOTING FRIENDS'. THE THEORY ELUCIDATES THAT GIVEN THAT CERTAIN PAIRS OR BLOCS EXHIBIT SYSTEMATIC VOTING BIAS FOR ONE ANOTHER OVER TIME, THE BIAS WILL BE CONSIDERABLY LESS AMONG IMPARTIAL STATES THAN THOSE WITH HIGHLY PARTIAL INSTITUTIONS. USING SEVERAL MEASURES OF 'FRIENDSHIP', I FIND STRONG EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS CLAIM, EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR MYRIAD ALTERNATIVE FACTORS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIOUS VOTING REGIMES. THE ANALYSIS GIVES US NEW INSIGHTS ON HOW POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS CONDITION AGGREGATE CITIZEN BEHAVIOR IN GENERAL AND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS MUCH BIAS IN ESC VOTING, NOT ALL BIAS IS EQUAL AMONG FRIEND-COUNTRIES.

127	THIS PAPER UNRAVELS THE DIVERSE STRANDS IN THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT (POTA, 2002), FOCUSING NOT ONLY ON LAW'S WORDS, I.E. THE RULES, PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES, AND ITS INTERPRETATIONS IN JUDGMENTS, BUT ALSO ON ITS EFFECTS. ADOPTING THE VIOLENCE OF JURISPRUDENCE APPROACH, IT ESCHEWS THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN LAW AND VIOLENCE, EXAMINING THE 'EFFECTS OF LEGAL FORCE', IN PARTICULAR, THE WAYS IN WHICH LAW BECOMES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ORGANIZATION OF STATE VIOLENCE. THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF THE UNFOLDING OF POTA AND LAWS DEALING WITH 'ORGANIZED CRIME' AND 'UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES' (UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES PREVENTION ACT, 1967, 2005), THE TRAJECTORY OF SPECIFIC CASES AND JUDGMENTS BY TRIAL COURTS, THE HIGH COURTS AND THE SUPREME COURT, THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW THROUGH AN INTERLOCKING OF THE ORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY, ANTI-TERROR LAWS ERODE BOTH THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, BECOME THE TERRAIN WHERE PERMUTATIONS IN ALLIANCE POLITICS AND CONFIGURATION OF POWER ARE PLAYED OUT, AND ASSUME AN ANTAGONISTIC NOTION OF POLITICS WHICH SEEKS RESOLUTION THROUGH THE ELIMINATION AND EXTERNALIZATION OF DIFFERENCE. EXTRAORDINARY LAWS, IT ARGUES, ARE MANIFESTATIONS OF A POLITICS OF NEGATION. PROCESSES THAT PROLONG THE LIVES OF SUCH LAWS, AND PROCEDURAL INTERLOCKING AND INTERMESHING THAT SEEK TO GIVE THEM PERMANENCE, ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF A DEEPENING OF THE POLITICS OF NEGATION.
128	ABOUT 350,000 TO 400,000 COERCED STERILIZATIONS WERE PERFORMED IN NAZI GERMANY BETWEEN 1934 AND 1945. THE LEGAL BASIS WAS THE,,ACT FOR THE PREVENTION OF CHILDREN WITH HEREDITARY DISEASES" OF JULY 14, 1933. EUGENIC STERILIZATION REQUIRED AN ORDER BY ONE OF THE,HERDITARY HEALTH COURTS", WHICH WERE SET UP FOR THE PURPOSE. THE COURT ORDERS WERE EXECUTED EVEN AGAINST THE WILL OF THE AFFECTED PERSONS. THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE STERILIZATIONS PERFORMED AT THE MATERNITY HOSPITAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF FREIBURG, GERMANY, AND THE PRACTICE OF EUGENICS IN FREIBURG AND BADEN DURING THE NAZI PERIOD. A REVIEW OF THE HOSPITAL RECORDS YIELDED 906 COMPULSORY EUGENIC STERILIZATIONS AND 36 ABORTIONS PERFORMED 1934-1945. THE MOST COMMON STATED INDICATIONS FOR STERILIZATION WERE CONGENITAL MENTAL DEFICIENCY (52%), SCHIZOPHRENIA (36%), EPILEPSY (5.8%), AND MANIC DEPRESSIVE INSANITY (3.8%). SOMATIC CONDITIONS LED TO STERILIZATIONS CONSIDERABLY LESS FREQUENTLY THAN MENTAL CONDITIONS. THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CONGENITAL MENTAL DEFICIENCY WERE,INTELLIGENCE DEFECT", A LACK OF,,LIFE JUSTIFICATION" AND,,SOCIAL ADAPTABILITY". THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE HEREDITARY HEALTH COURTS CANNOT BE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF A COURT IN A COUNTRY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW; THEY MUST BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NATIONALIST SOCIALIST CONCEPT OF LEGALITY. AN ANALYSIS OF CONTEMPORARY MEDICAL AND LEGAL LITERATURE PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE IDEOLOGY OF RACIAL CLEANSING AND NATIONAL SOCIALIST CONCEPT OF LEGALITY.
129	THE SOCIALIST IDEAS OF RUSSIAN REVOLUTION WERE WELL-KNOWN IN PERU, ACCORDING WITH THE STRUGGLES OF WORKING-CLASS AND STUDENT MOVEMENTS AND THE BIRTH OF SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST PARTIES. BUT THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTIONS OF 1920 AND 1993 ONLY OPENED SOMEONE SOCIAL RIGHTS, NOT ONLY FOR THE WORKERS, BUT ALSO FOR THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY TERRITORIES. ONLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF 1979 THE LEFTWING CONSTITUENTS WERE ALMOST ONE THIRD OF THE CONSTITUENTS. IN THIS WAY THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDED SOCIAL IDEAS IN THE TYPE OF STATE AS SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, THE EQUAL RIGHTS BETWEEN ALL PERSONS, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, THE EMPLOYMENT WAS PROTECT BY THE STATE, THE PUBLIC EDUCATION COST-FREE, THE PROPERTY HAD A SOCIAL FUNCTION, THE NATURAL RESOURCES WERE OF THE NATION, AND THE INDIGENOUS AND AMAZONIAN COMMUNITIES WERE PROTECTED, ETC. BUT, WITH THE NEOLIBERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1993 THE ECONOMIC MODEL WAS LIBERALIZED IN FAVOR OF THE MARKET AND THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS, REDUCING THE SOCIAL RIGHTS, AND THE NATIONAL POWER WAS CENTRALIZED IN THE EXECUTIVE POWER. BUT, SINCE 2000, AFTER THE FALL-DOWN OF FUJIMORI'S REGIMEN, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PLAYED A ROLE OF BALANCED THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW MODEL, ACCORDING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL RIGHTS. IN THIS SENSE, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WAS ABLE TO GIVE THE CONSTITUTION OF 1993 A SOCIAL CONTENT.
130	WHERE DEMOCRACY IS FRAGILE AND INSTITUTIONS FUNCTION POORLY, PARTICULARLY IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, COMPETITION LAW FACES TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. GETTING A NEW AGENCY STARTED AND GETTING THE TRACTION NEEDED TO ENSURE THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW COMPETITION FRAMEWORK CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. YET THE EFFORT IS WORTHWHILE, EVEN IF A COUNTRY HAS HAD A HISTORY OF 'FALSE DAWNS' IN THIS POLICY FIELD. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE NEW COMPETITION REGIME IN THE PHILIPPINES. FROM A GENERAL PERSPECTIVE IT RECALLS THAT WHILE COMPETITION LAW DOES NOT BY ITSELF GUARANTEE SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, IT IS A DESIRABLE PART OF A BROADER ENSEMBLE OF POLICIES THAT CAN PROMOTE THOSE AIMS. IN MORE COUNTRY-SPECIFIC TERMS, THE NEW LAW DISCUSSED HERE-THE COMPETITION ACT 2015, FULLY EFFECTIVE SINCE THE SUMMER OF 2017-CAN ONLY BE PROPERLY CONSIDERED BY UNDERSTANDING THE PHILIPPINES ITSELF. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE SURVEYS THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS; ITS ECONOMY; AND THE ROLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE COURTS. THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK SPECIFIC TO COMPETITION LAW AND POLICY IS THEN ANALYSED AT LENGTH. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ACT, THE ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONING POWERS OF THE PHILIPPINE COMPETITION COMMISSION, AND RELEVANT LEGAL PROCEDURES ARE ALL EXAMINED. NOW THAT THE LEGISLATOR HAS ESTABLISHED A PROMISING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK, IT IS TIME TO FOCUS ON THE MOST DIFFICULT TASKS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND DEEP CULTURE CHANGE.
131	THIS ARTICLE ENGAGES WITH CURRENT DEBATES ON THE SOCIOLOGY OF CAMPS AND CAMP-LIKE INSTITUTIONS IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY. DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL COLLECTED IN ITALY IN 'NOMAD CAMPS' WHERE FORCIBLY DISPLACED ROMA FROM FORMER YUGOSLAVIA WERE SHELTERED IN THE 1990S AND 2000S, IT ARGUES THAT AGAMBEN'S CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE CAMP AS A SPACE OF EXCEPTION, BY CONSTRUCTING THE CAMP AS OTHER TO AN IDEALISED NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP AND THE RULE OF LAW, OFFERS LIMITED PURCHASE FOR A SOCIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COMPLEXITY AND AMBIVALENCE OF SOCIAL RELATIONS IN AND AROUND CAMPS AS WELL AS RESIDENTS' EVERYDAY PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES OF POLITICAL MEMBERSHIP. FOCUSING ON THE RESOURCES, ENTITLEMENTS AND 'RIGHTS' OF CAMP RESIDENTS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS, THIS ARTICLE INVITES TO DE-EXCEPTIONALISE THE CAMP AND THE EXPERIENCES OF ITS RESIDENTS, AND PROPOSES THE CONCEPT OF 'CAMPZENSHIP' TO CAPTURE THE SPECIFIC AND SITUATED FORM OF POLITICAL MEMBERSHIP PRODUCED IN AND BY THE CAMP. GETTING CLOSER TO THE CAMP AND ITS INHABITANTS THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF AN ETHNOGRAPHIC GAZE REVEALS THE CAMP SPACE AS PARADIGMATIC OF THE STRATIFICATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF POLITICAL MEMBERSHIP IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY, A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TERRAIN WHERE RIGHTS, ENTITLEMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE RESHAPED, BENDED, ADJUSTED, NEGLECTED AND ACTIVATED BY AND THROUGH EVERYDAY INTERACTIONS.
132	AMONG SEVERAL GROUPS VULNERABLE TO DISCRIMINATION IN 21ST CENTURY EUROPE, ROMA LOOM LARGE BECAUSE THE POORER, TRADITIONALLY-MINDED ELEMENTS CONTINUE TO RESIST INTEGRATION AND REMAIN ON THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY. MOST OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED HAVE BECOME EU CITIZENS AS A RESULT OF RECENT ACCESSION BY EAST CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHERE MARGINALISATION HAS BEEN TOLERATED, WITH VARYING DEGREES OF DISCRIMINATION, EVER SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY ABOLITION OF FEUDALISM. IN THE INTEREST OF A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY, ROMA ARE NOW BEING ENCOURAGED TO STRIVE FOR LIVING STANDARDS COMPARABLE WITH THOSE ENJOYED BY THE MAINSTREAM POPULATION. THIS PAPER CONCENTRATES ON ROMANIA, WHICH HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST ROMA COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE. WE PROFILE THE SITUATION WITH SOME REFERENCE TO REGIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AND PREVIOUS POLICY HISTORY. WE EXAMINE THE KEY CONCEPTS RELEVANT TO MARGINALITY, ARGUING FOR AN ELEMENT OF SELF-EXCLUSION, BECAUSE WHILE MANY ROMA ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ASSIMILATED OVER THE YEARS, A LARGE RESIDUAL ELEMENT INSISTS ON PRESERVING ELEMENTS OF 'IDENTITY', IMPLYING SEPARATION FROM THE MAINSTREAM IN TERMS OF THE MODERNISING ETHOS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE MAIN THRUST OF THE PAPER RESTS WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE ROMA COMMUNITY AS A MAJOR ELEMENT AMONG A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS WHICH ARE WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME OBJECTIVE. WE GIVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE EDUCATION PROGRAMME THAT IS NOW MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.
133	IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WESTERN AUSTRALIA (WA) INTRODUCED IN NOVEMBER 2020 A MANDATORY CONTACT TRACING REGISTRATION SYSTEM AND ROLLED OUT AN ONLINE MOBILE APPLICATION (THE SAFEWA APP) WHICH ALLOWED USERS TO EASILY CHECK-IN TO VENUES AT WHICH THEY WERE REQUIRED TO REGISTER THEIR ATTENDANCE. THE WA PUBLIC WAS ASSURED THAT THEIR CHECK-IN DATA, INCLUDING DATA LOGGED THROUGH THE SAFEWA APP, WOULD ONLY BE USED FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES. DESPITE THIS, IT LATER CAME TO LIGHT THAT WA POLICE HAD SOUGHT AND GAINED ACCESS TO DATA COLLECTED BY THE SAFEWA APP IN CONNECTION WITH CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. FOLLOWING THAT REVELATION, AND TO ADDRESS ITS POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE SAFEWA APP (AND THE CONTACT TRACING SYSTEM IN GENERAL), THE WA GOVERNMENT INTRODUCED THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION (ENTRY REGISTRATION INFORMATION RELATING TO COVID-19 AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES) ACT 2021 (WA). THAT ACT, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE IN JUNE 2021, PROVIDES THAT ENTRY REGISTRATION INFORMATION CAN BE USED ONLY FOR CONTACT TRACING AND SOME OTHER SPECIFIED PURPOSES AND CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGISLATIVE BASIS OF WA'S MANDATORY CONTACT TRACING REGISTRATION SYSTEM AND HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LAW-MAKING, PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT AND THE RULE OF LAW WHICH RESULT FROM THE USE OF SUBSIDIARY LEGISLATION TO EFFECT SIGNIFICANT CONTROLS OVER THE PUBLIC.
134	COMPOSED AS A MOSAIC, THE PRESENT ARTICLE BRINGS TOGETHER A SERIES OF URBAN SNAPSHOTS, BY WAY OF ETHNOGRAPHIC POLAROIDS, WHICH PROCEED FROM THREE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH INFORMAL WORKERS IN MEXICO AND SPAIN. THE CHARACTERS AND INSTANCES DISSEMINATED THROUGHOUT THE TEXT ACCOUNT FOR THE URBAN "STATE OF EXCEPTION", ESPECIALLY EXPERIENCED BY SECTORS OF THE POPULATION THAT HAVE SUFFERED NOT ONLY FORMS OF EXPLOITATION BUT ALSO OF EXPROPRIATION. THOSE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS LUMPENPROLETARIAT REFUSE TO LEAVE THE CITY. WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO USE THE STREET AS A MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE, THEY ARE POINTED AT AS THE USUAL SUSPECTS WHEN THE PUBLIC ORDER IS DEFIED. THE LITERATURE ON URBAN STUDIES TENDS TO DEFINE THE PUBLICITY OF THE URBAN SPACE AS A CATEGORY THAT RESULTS FROM THE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE STREET, THROUGH WHICH THIS BECOMES SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY OFFERS A CRITICAL COUNTERPOINT TO THIS DOMINANT IDEA, RATHER SHOWING THE ROLE PLAYED BY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES IN PROMOTING AND MAINTAINING EXCLUSIVE POLICIES OF PRIVATISATION, COMMERCIALISATION, AND CONTROL OF THE SO-CALLED "PUBLIC SPACE". WITHIN THIS ANALYSIS, INFORMALITY IS PRESENTED AS A POLITICAL RESPONSE TO THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO THE CITY, WHILE FOR THE URBAN DISPOSSESSED, IT REPRESENTS A STRATEGY TO REALISE, DE FACTO, THIS SAME RIGHT.
135	THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, LAW AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SO CONFINED TO OR DOMINATED BY THE ECONOMIC, THAT A CLEAR BREAK WITH THE PAST MAY BE NEEDED. THE "THREE MOMENTS" ANALYSIS THAT TRUBEK AND SANTOS PRESENTED IN 2006 SHOWS THAT, WHEREAS LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORY MOVED FROM LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR STATE POWER (FIRST MOMENT) TO LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF THE MARKET (SECOND MOMENT), AND IN A THIRD MOMENT WAS CONCEIVED OF AS REGULATING THE MARKET, IT NEVER LOST ITS PRIMARY FOCUS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ON ECONOMIC LAW. AND MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, IT MAY NEVER HAVE MOVED BEYOND A MARKET-FRIENDLY APPROACH. JUST LIKE INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS (INCLUDING LAW, LEGAL INSTITUTIONS) WERE FOR A LONG TIME MARGINAL IN DEVELOPMENT THEORIES, JUSTICE CONCERNS HAVE NOT TAKEN CENTER STAGE IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW HAS HAD SOME TRACTION. THIS BEGS THE QUESTION WHETHER THOSE STUDYING THE ROLE OF LAW IN BRINGING ABOUT JUSTICE AND TRANSFORMATIVE SOCIAL CHANGE SHOULD CLAIM THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT FIELD AS THEIR FIELD OF STUDY TOO, OR RATHER CREATE A COUNTERVAILING FIELD. THIS PAPER EXAMINES PROS AND CONS FOR CLAIMING A FOURTH MOMENT IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES BY THOSE WHO STUDY WHETHER AND HOW LAW (INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS LAW) DISCIPLINES AND TAMES THE STATE, THE MARKET AND OTHER POWERFUL ACTORS.
136	IN 2016, THE SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA MARKED 175 YEARS SINCE A RESIDENT JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES ARRIVED TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE IN THE PORT PHILLIP DISTRICT. THIS ANNIVERSARY HAS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE SUPREME COURT, BEFORE THOSE YEARS ARE GREYED FROM MEMORY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COURT SINCE ITS COLONIAL BEGINNINGS HAS AT TIMES HAPPENED AT GREAT SPEED WITH THE COURT RESPONDING TO THE VEXED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES OF THE DAY, FROM MURDER TO FRAUD AND INSOLVENCY. AT OTHER TIMES, IT SEEMS THE PACE HAS BEEN QUITE GLACIAL. BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF COURT SERVICES VICTORIA IN 2014, THE SUPREME COURT HAD SPENT DECADES TUSSLING WITH THE EXECUTIVE FOR CONTROL OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COURTS. THE EXECUTIVE WOULD ASSERT THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, THE JUDICIARY WOULD RESPOND EMPHASISING THE NEED FOR THE COURT'S INDEPENDENCE AS THE THIRD ARM OF GOVERNMENT. INERTIA WAS THE REGULAR OUTCOME. THE COURT'S EFFORTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INDIGENOUS OWNERS OF THE LAND ON WHICH THE SUPREME COURT RESTS AND OVER WHICH IT WIELDS THE RULE OF LAW ALSO CAME AFT ER A PERIOD OF DISAPPOINTING INACTION. COMMEMORATING THIS ANNIVERSARY ENSURES SUCH SHORTCOMINGS AND THE EFFORTS TO REDRESS THEM ARE NOT LEFT WITHOUT COMMENT TO THE CONFINES OF HISTORY.
137	CHINA'S CURRENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPRS) SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH THE TRANSPLANTATION OF THE CONCEPT AND MODELS FROM THE WESTERN WORLD FOLLOWING ITS SOCIALIST MARKET ECONOMY REFORMS IN THE LATE 1970S. THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING AN IP REGIME IN CHINA THUS REFLECTS A VIVID MODEL OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW CHINA'S IP REGIME HAS BEEN SHAPED AND HOW THE LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION OF IP LAWS HAS INTERACTED WITH NORM BUILDING CONCERNING IPRS IN CHINESE SOCIETY. IN CHINA, LOCAL SOCIAL NORMS INHERENTLY CONFLICT WITH THE IDEA OF IPRS. CHINA'S IP NORMS HAVE BEEN SHAPED BY THE CONVERGENCE OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND LEGAL FACTORS. THEREFORE, IN TRANSPLANTING FOREIGN IP LAWS, CHINA HAS ALSO CREATED ITS OWN LEGAL AND SOCIAL NORMS, WHICH DIVERGE FROM THOSE OF THE SOURCE OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION. IN THIS PROCESS, CHINA IS THUS NOT ONLY A NORM TAKER BUT ALSO A NORM MAKER. THE RESISTANCE TO THE LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION OF IPRS HAS LED TO A DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE FORMAL IP RULES IN CHINA AND THE ACTUAL IP NORMS AS THEY ARE FOLLOWED IN PRACTICE, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN DIFFICULTY IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF IP LAWS. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CONVERGENCE BETWEEN IP LAWS AND IP NORMS IN CHINA WILL ULTIMATELY REQUIRE IMPROVEMENTS IN IP GOVERNANCE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RULE-OF-LAW NORMS IN CHINA.
138	THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE ON BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR AN INTERNATIONAL LARGE SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES FOR A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS (2007-2012). THE DIMENSIONS OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE AT MACROECONOMIC LEVEL WILL BE CAPTURED BY USING THE FOLLOWING SIX INDICATORS DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD BANK: 1. VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; 2. POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE; 3. GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; 4. REGULATORY QUALITY; 5. RULE OF LAW; 6. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. TO CAPTURE THE QUALITY OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WE USE THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS INDEX DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD BANK IN ITS DOING BUSINESS REPORT SERIES. TO MEASURE ENTREPRENEURSHIP WE USE THE WORLD BANK GROUP ENTREPRENEURSHIP SURVEY WHERE THE NUMBER OF NEW REGISTERED BUSINESSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE WORKING AGE POPULATION IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ORDER TO CAPTURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE DOES INFLUENCE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WE ANALYZE THE DATA USING CROSS-SECTIONAL TIME-SERIES RANDOM EFFECTS GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARE (GLS) MODELS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PANEL DATA ANALYSIS CLARIFIES AND QUANTIFIES THE INFLUENCE THAT VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE COULD HAVE ON BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY-MAKERS AS WELL AS FOR BUSINESSES.
139	WHILE THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM EVOKES THE IDEA OF TAMING POLITICS THROUGH THE FORCE OF LAW, THE MAKING OF CONSTITUTIONS IS IN FACT A CONTESTED SOCIAL PROCESS IN WHICH DIFFERENT JURIS-GENERATIVE ACTORS VIE FOR DISCURSIVE HEGEMONY. NO WONDER THEN THAT IN A PLURALIST POST-NATIONAL SETTING, THE PROJECT OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IS CONTINUOUSLY CHALLENGED BY STATES FROM THE PERIPHERY. THOSE STATES VIEW CONSTITUTIONALISM AS ESSENTIALLY A HEGEMONIC PROJECT, WHICH CONDENSES WESTERN NOTIONS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, HUMAN RIGHTS, ETC. INTO THE NUCLEUS OF AN EMERGING GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CHALLENGE FOR THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, FOCUSING ON THE RULE OF LAW DIMENSION OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. I SHALL ARGUE THAT A REALIST CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE AGENTSTRUCTURE NEXUS, WHICH VIEWS CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AS MERE EPIPHENOMENA OF HEGEMONIC POWER, IS TOO NARROW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH AGENTS FROM THE PERIPHERY AND GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES INTERACT. INSTEAD, I SHALL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FIVE INTERACTION SCENARIOS, NAMELY TRANSFORMATION, LOCALIZATION, COOPTATION/ADAPTATION, OBSTRUCTION, AND WITHDRAWAL. MY CLAIM IS THAT THE AU'S REFUSAL TO BE COOPTED BY THE SYSTEM MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS PART OF A BROADER CAMPAIGN AIMED AT REORGANIZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES INVOLVED IN GLOBAL (AND REGIONAL) GOVERNANCE.
140	THE ATTRIBUTED SUI GENERIS CHARACTER OF THE EU AS A POLITY HAS OFTEN BEEN CITED AS THE BASIS FOR NOT APPLYING A CLASSIC SEPARATION OF POWERS ANALYSIS TO IT. YET IT IS A LOGICAL NON SEQUITUR TO INFER THE INAPPLICABILITY OF A SEPARATION OF POWERS FRAMEWORK TO THE EU ON THIS BASIS: NO PARTICULAR PROPOSITION OF POLITICAL OR LEGAL MORALITY CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY INFERRED OR EXCLUDED FROM THE ATTRIBUTED GENERIC NOVELTY OF THE EU RELATIVE TO STATES. THE EU CERTAINLY HAS SOME NOVEL FEATURES, BUT THAT OBSERVATION OF ITSELF DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT SUCH NOVELTY REQUIRES AN ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL NORMATIVITY (RATHER, IT NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED HOW WHATEVER PARTICULAR NOVELTY THE EU POSSESSES IS SUCH AS TO REQUIRE THE EXCLUSION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS THINKING). THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SEPARATION OF POWERS ANALYSIS IS: FIRST, DESCRIPTIVELY ACCURATE, TO A LARGE EXTENT, FOR MUCH OF THE WORKING OF THE EU APART FROM THE LAW-MAKING ROLE OF THE ECJ; AND, SECONDLY, NORMATIVELY ATTRACTIVE AS A MEANS OF PRACTICALLY SAFEGUARDING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY AN ANALYSIS OF THE SUBSTITUTE FOR A SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE CASELAW OF THE ECJ, NAMELY THE PRINCIPLE OF INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE, WHICH IT IS ARGUED IS TOO VAGUE AND INDETERMINATE TO BE A SATISFACTORY ALTERNATIVE.
141	BRITAIN HAS THE OLDEST CONSTITUTIONAL AND REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS AN UNWRITTEN, CUSTOMARY AND UN-CODIFIED CONSTITUTION THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER CENTURIES. IT POSSESSES SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THE FEATURES NOW ASSOCIATED WITH MODERN DEMOCRATIC WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS WIDESPREAD IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE. WHILE THIS CONSTITUTION ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FROM THE MID-NINETEENTH THROUGH THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY, IN MORE RECENT DECADES IT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO MUCH CRITICISM AND HAS BEEN ALTERED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MAJOR RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE DECISIONS TAKEN TO DEVOLVE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AWAY FROM WESTMINSTER TO LOCAL LEGISLATURES AND EXECUTIVES IN SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND HAVE TOGETHER LED TO CHALLENGES TO THE LONG-ESTABLISHED SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OF THE CROWN-IN-PARLIAMENT, MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND UNDERMINED THE FORMER WAYS IN WHICH THE EXECUTIVE WAS ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE. THE UNITED KINGDOM NO LONGER POSSESSES THE CONSTITUTION SO ADMIRED UNTIL RECENTLY BUT HAS NOT YET EVOLVED A NEW CONSTITUTION CAPABLE OF WINNING WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FROM ALL SOCIAL STRATA AND ALL PARTS OF THE KINGDOM. THE RESULT IS A PUBLIC SHARPLY DIVIDED ON HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOULD RESPOND TO THE CHANGES WROUGHT BY ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE DEVOLUTION OF SOME OF WESTMINSTER'S AUTHORITY TO SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND.
142	THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN, IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE A NORMATIVE POWER IN WORLD POLITICS. THIS IS A STRONG CLAIM WITH A CRITICAL AIM: TO PROMOTE NORMATIVE APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF THE EU. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NORMATIVE ETHICS OF THE EU WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE SPECIAL ISSUE'S DISCUSSION OF ETHICS IN EU FOREIGN POLICY. THIS WILL INVOLVE A DISCUSSION OF THE ETHICS OF THE EU'S NORMATIVE POWER, THAT IS, THE POWER TO NORMALIZE A MORE JUST, COSMOPOLITICAL WORLD. THE ARTICLE WILL FIRST CONSIDER THE CREATIVE EFFORTS OF THE EU'S 'NORMATIVE POWER' IN CONCEPTUAL TERMS. IT WILL THEN CONSIDER THE NINE SUBSTANTIVE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES THE EU PROMOTES IN WORLD POLITICS: SUSTAINABLE PEACE; SOCIAL FREEDOM; CONSENSUAL DEMOCRACY; ASSOCIATIVE HUMAN RIGHTS; SUPRANATIONAL RULE OF LAW; INCLUSIVE EQUALITY; SOCIAL SOLIDARITY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE ARTICLE WILL THEN DISCUSS HOW TO JUDGE THE EU'S PRINCIPLES, ACTIONS AND IMPACT BY USING THREE MAJOR APPROACHES TO PROCEDURAL NORMATIVE ETHICS-VIRTUE ETHICS, DEONTOLOGICAL ETHICS AND CONSEQUENTIALIST ETHICS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT WE MUST JUDGE THE EU'S CREATIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE A MORE JUST, COSMOPOLITICAL WORLD IN TERMS OF ITS PRINCIPLES, ACTIONS AND IMPACT, ALTHOUGH THESE MAY DIFFER. THESE THREE APPROACHES PROVIDE THE EU WITH MAXIMS THAT SHOULD SHAPE THE EU'S NORMATIVE POWER IN WORLD POLITICS: LIVE BY EXAMPLE, BE REASONABLE AND DO LEAST HARM.
143	THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT) HAS LONG BEEN THE CORNERSTONE OF THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO RETARD THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONRY TO ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES, NOW APPRECIATED AS THE GREATEST POST-COLD WAR THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. UNDER THIS TREATY, THE PARTIES ALSO UNDERTOOK TO PURSUE IN GOOD FAITH ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS LEADING TO FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS-AND, IN FACT, SUCH SUBSEQUENT BARGAINING HAS RECENTLY YIELDED DRAMATIC, FAR-REACHING SUCCESSES. PROFESSOR KOPLOW, HOWEVER, ARGUES THAT IN ONE CRUCIAL RESPECT, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DERELICT IN IMPLEMENTING THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE NPT: RECENT AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE RIGIDLY REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO A COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY, ABOLISHING ALL NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE. ALTHOUGH THE NPT'S REQUIREMENT OF TEST BAN NEGOTIATIONS IS AMBIGUOUSLY STATED, A CLOSE READING OF THE LEGAL MATERIALS ESTABLISHES THAT IT WAS A KEY INGREDIENT IN THE BASIC BARGAIN OF THE NPT, AND THAT NUMEROUS COUNTRIES CONSIDER IT A MAJOR, UNRESOLVED TREATY CONTROVERSY. PROFESSOR KOPLOW CONTENDS THAT THIS UNITED STATES REFUSAL TO PURSUE A TEST BAN TREATY IS NOT MERELY UNWISE STRATEGY, IT IS A VIOLATION OF THE COUNTRY'S INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMITMENTS, EXPOSING THE UNITED STATES TO LEGAL REMEDIES AND UNDERMINING BOTH THE GLOBAL NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME AND THE MORE GENERAL CAMPAIGN TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR A NEW WORLD ORDER BASED UPON GREATER FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW.
144	IN THE STUDY, THE QUESTION OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LEGAL MONITORING IS DEVELOPED AND THE EXPEDIENCY OF INTRODUCING LEGAL MONITORING INTO THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF UKRAINE WITH THE PURPOSE OF ITS PERFECTION IS SUBSTANTIATED. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BASIS OF MONITORING IS A SYSTEM OF INDICATORS THAT CHARACTERIZE A CONCRETE MEASURE OF A CHANGE IN A PARTICULAR PHENOMENON OR PROCESS. THE PRACTICE OF APPLYING THE INTEGRAL INDICATOR OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION TO GOVERNANCE RESEARCH INDICATOR COUNTRY SNAPSHOT IS PRESENTED. MOREOVER, EXAMPLES OF MONITORING ARE PROVIDED FOR SUCH INDEXES AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; REGULATORY QUALITY; RULE OF LAW. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, A RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE TO ASSESS THE STATE OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM, FOCUSED ON THE RESULTS OF MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATION AND ITS PRACTICE. THE MONITORING MECHANISMS ARE PROPOSED FOR ELIMINATION OF SHORTCOMINGS IN THE LEGISLATION. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS AN INCENTIVE FOR IMPROVING THE LEGAL AND INFORMATIONAL LITERACY OF ALL CATEGORIES OF CIVIL SERVANTS. SUCH A TASK CAN BE SOLVED BY INTRODUCING NEW CRITERIA INTO THE SYSTEM OF ATTESTATION OF SPECIALISTS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND COURT EMPLOYEES. THIS IS NECESSARY TO ADD AND REFINE THE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS IN MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION SPECIALTIES. LEGAL MONITORING SHOULD BE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REFORMS IN UKRAINE.
145	ACCORDING TO CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING'S REPORT AT THE 19TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS, REALIZING CHINA'S GREAT DREAM IN THE NEW ERA DEMANDS A GREAT STRUGGLE, A GREAT PROJECT, AND A GREAT CAUSE. IN TERMS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION, ENTERING A NEW ERA MEANS CHINA MUST ENSURE THE HARMONY BETWEEN MAN AND NATURE, AND UNDERTAKE "A GREAT STRUGGLE WITH MANY NEW CONTEMPORARY FEATURES", IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES IN NATURE. TO REALIZE THE CHINESE DREAM OF NATIONAL REJUVENATION REQUIRES A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE "THOUGHT ON SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS FOR A NEW ERA AND THE BASIC POLICY" INTRODUCED AT THE 19TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS THAT INVOLVES SUCH CONCEPTS AS THE VISION FOR DEVELOPMENT, FUNDAMENTAL RULES, ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS, THE RULE OF LAW, THE MODEL, OBJECTIVES AND DRIVING FORCES OF DEVELOPMENT, WAYS OF LIFE, AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. BASED ON THE CONNOTATIONS OF SUCH CONCEPTS, THE ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION CAN SYSTEMICALLY GRASP THE BASIC STRATEGY FOR BUILDING A SOCIALIST ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE COGNITION OF BUILDING AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION IN THE NEW ERA, EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM OF ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF ETHICAL VALUES, VALUE THEORY AND PRINCIPLES OF GROWTH, AND SPECIFIES THE STRATEGIC MEASURES FOR BUILDING AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION IN LIGHT OF THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND DEMANDS.
146	INTERNATIONALIZATION IS A CRITICAL TASK FOR ONLINE RETAILERS, YET THE QUESTION OF HOW AND IN WHICH ORDER ONLINE RETAILERS CHOOSE FOREIGN MARKETS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. BASED ON DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY, TEST AND EXPLAIN FACTORS INFLUENCING THE FOREIGN MARKET SELECTION BEHAVIOR OF EUROPEAN ONLINE RETAILERS. FOLLOWING A DYNAMIC, PATH-DEPENDENT VIEW OF THE MARKET SELECTION PROCESS OVER TIME, THE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED USING A LONGITUDINAL DATABASE CONTAINING OBSERVATIONS OF THE FOREIGN MARKET SELECTION BEHAVIOR OF 140 ONLINE RETAILERS IN EUROPE, ACCOUNTING FOR 825 MARKET ENTRIES OVER 15 YEARS. THE USE OF A RANK-ORDERED LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL ALLOWS THE OBSERVATION OF HOW DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES CONTRIBUTE TO OVERALL EVALUATIONS OF THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF CHOSEN MARKETS, ASSUMING THAT ONLINE RETAILERS ATTEMPT TO MAXIMIZE THE UTILITY OF MARKETS FOR THEIR SPECIFIC INTERESTS, IN DEPENDENCE OF THE OBSERVED FACTORS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MARKET SIZE, RULE OF LAW, AND LOCAL MARKET KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS A COMMON LANGUAGE AND THE LOGISTICS PERFORMANCE OF A TARGET COUNTRY HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF SELECTING A TARGET COUNTRY. ALTHOUGH THE INTERNET IS SAID TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF DISTANCE, BOTH CULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AS WELL AS ADDED GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE STILL SHOW A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE SELECTION OF FOREIGN MARKETS BY ONLINE RETAILERS.

147	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO RELATE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE WITH CRIME IN MALAYSIA. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIES THE BEST GOOD GOVERNANCE TOOL TO FIGHT AGAINST CRIME IN MALAYSIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY USES TIME-SERIES DATA ON CRIME RATES AND SIX MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. IN THIS STUDY THE AUTHORS EMPLOYED THE POPULAR AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGGED MODELING APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE LONG-RUN MODEL OF CRIME AND GOVERNANCE. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE LOWERS CRIME RATES (TOTAL CRIME, VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIMES). THE RESULTS SUGGEST A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIME RATES AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN MALAYSIA. THIS SUGGESTS THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE REDUCES CRIME RATES IN MALAYSIA. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY IS THE SHORT TIME-SERIES USED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS FROM 1996 TO 2009. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT THE PRACTICE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, LOWER CORRUPTION, GOOD POLICING AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM CAN MITIGATE CRIME IN MALAYSIA. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE WILL PROTECT PROPERTY RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS, BUSINESS SECTOR AND THE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE, AND THIS WILL ENHANCE PROSPERITY OF A NATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY PROVIDE THE FIRST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT LINKING BETWEEN CRIME AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IN MALAYSIA.
148	THE RECENT MOVES OF THE INDIAN ECONOMY TOWARDS FURTHER OPENING UP OF THE ECONOMY WITH LESS GOVERNMENT CONTROL HAS BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGES IN ITS POLICY STRUCTURE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GREATER ECONOMIC FREEDOM LEADS TO HIGHER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A FEDERAL SYSTEM LIKE INDIA WHERE BUSINESS REGULATIONS, TAXATION, AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING DIFFER WIDELY ACROSS STATES. POOLED LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL IS APPLIED TO CATEGORICAL DATA CONTAINING ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ITS THREE COMPONENTS AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, AND GROWTH RATES OF INCOME PER CAPITA AND GROSS STATE DOMESTIC PRODUCT AS DEPENDENT VARIABLE, FOR A PANEL OF TWENTY STATES FOR THREE TIME PERIODS, 2004/2005, 2006/2007 AND 2009/2010. WHILE EXAMINING THIS RELATIONSHIP, THE VARIABLES LIKE INITIAL INCOME PER CAPITA, INITIAL LITERACY RATE, SECTORAL COMPOSITION, AND INFLATION RATE ARE TAKEN AS CONTROL. THE RESULTS TEND TO ESTABLISH THE FUNDAMENTAL EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN FOSTERING ECONOMIC GROWTH. THREE INDIVIDUAL DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM NAMELY SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, STRONG RULE OF LAW, AND FLEXIBLE REGULATIONS GOVERNING CREDIT, LABOUR, AND PRODUCT MARKETS ARE LIKELY TO EXERT BENEFICIAL IMPACTS ON INCOME GROWTH. INITIAL INCOME PER CAPITA EXERTS A POSITIVE IMPACT, THUS PROVING THE PREVALENCE OF REGIONAL DIVERGENCE ON THIS FRONT. HIGH HUMAN CAPITAL, GREATER SHARE OF THE SERVICES AND INFLATION EXERT DIRECT IMPACT ON GROWTH.
149	ALTHOUGH US AND EUROPEAN RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED IMPROVEMENT IN EARNINGS QUALITY ASSOCIATED WITH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS, THE SITUATION IN LATIN AMERICA IS QUESTIONABLE, GIVEN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH FIRMS OPERATE, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY CONTROLLING FAMILY OWNERSHIP AND WEAK LEGAL PROTECTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND EARNINGS MANAGEMENT MEASURED BY DISCRETIONARY ACCRUAL. WE USE A SAMPLE OF LISTED LATIN AMERICAN NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES FROM THE PERIOD 2006-2009. OUR RESULTS SHOW HOW IN THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL DIRECTORS IS LIMITED AND THAT BOARDS WHICH MEET MORE FREQUENTLY TAKE A MORE ACTIVE POSITION IN THE MONITORING OF INSIDERS, SO SHOWING A LOWER USE OF MANIPULATIVE PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, WE FIND A NON-LINEAR RELATION BETWEEN INSIDER OWNERSHIP AND DISCRETIONARY ACCRUALS, ALSO POINTING TO THE FACT THAT OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION MAY BE A MANIPULATIVE PRACTICES CONSTRICTOR MECHANISM ONLY WHEN THE OWNERSHIP OF MAIN SHAREHOLDERS IS MODERATE. THE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS SINCE THIS IS, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST STUDY TO ANALYZE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EARNINGS MANAGEMENT BEHAVIOR. AS POLICY IMPLICATIONS, WE DOCUMENT HOW WHEN A COUNTRY IMPLEMENTS CONTROLS AIMED AT REDUCING CORRUPTION, STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW OR IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT, THIS LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN FIRM EARNINGS MANAGEMENT.
150	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CHINESE HEALTH CARE REGULATION IN AN ERA OF TRANSITION. IT DESCRIBES THE MAJOR HEALTH CARE REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS OPERATING CURRENTLY IN CHINA AND ANALYZES THE UNDERLYING FACTORS. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT IN THE TRANSITION FROM A PLANNED TO A MARKET ECONOMY, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN EMPLOYING A HYBRID APPROACH WHERE BOTH OLD AND NEW INSTITUTIONS HAVE A ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF EMERGING MARKETS, INCLUDING THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREMENTAL REFORM STRATEGY ADOPTED BY THE PARTY-STATE. ALTHOUGH A HEALTH CARE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HAS GRADUALLY TAKEN SHAPE, THE FRAMEWORK IS INCOMPLETE, WITH A PARTICULAR LACK OF EMPHASIS ON PROFESSIONAL SELF-REGULATION. IN ADDITION, ITS EFFECTIVENESS IS LIMITED DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF MANY REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS. IN POOR RURAL AREAS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IS FURTHER UNDERMINED OR DISTORTED BY THE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL POSITION THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FIND THEMSELVES IN. THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF 'RULE OF LAW' BY POLICY MAKERS AND OFFICIALS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND THE WIDESPREAD INFORMAL NETWORK OF RELATIONS BETWEEN KNOWN INDIVIDUALS (GUANXI) PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE OPERATION OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER REVEAL THE COMPLEX NATURE OF REGULATING HEALTH CARE IN TRANSITIONAL CHINA. (C) 2007 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
151	SOME STUDIES ON THE MODERN CRIMINAL POLICY OF ENEMY MAINLY AFFIRM THAT THE - CRIMINAL POLICY THAT HAS BEEN APPLIED IN COLOMBIA PRESENTS SOME OF THE ENEMY PENAL LAW CHARACTERISTICS, THOSE THAT BEGIN WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE PENAL RIGHT BASED ON THE INCREASE OF THE PUNISHABLE BEHAVIOR AND THE REDUCTION OF CITIZENS RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES. NEVERTHELESS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODERN THEORY OF THE PENAL ENEMY LAW AND THE CRIMINAL POLICY, AT LEAST OF THE MADE ONE BY GUNTHER JAKOBS, ARE FAR TO CORRESPOND TO THIS DESCRIPTION AND THE OWN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRIMINAL POLICY OF THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURE PRACTICED IN COLOMBIA DURING THE LAST DECADES. ON THE CONTRARY, MODERN THE ENEMY PENAL LAW, LOOKS FOR CONCILIATION OF EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PENAL SYSTEM WITH THE RESPECT TO THE CITIZENS RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES, AND TO CLARIFY THE DECISION MAKING IN CRIMINAL MATTER IN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND, IT LOOKS FOR ADAPTING THE REPRESSION, THE REPAIR AND THE PREVENTION OF THE CRIMINAL CONDUCTS WITH THE SOCIAL MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ENEMY CRIMINAL POLICY PRACTICED BY, ACCUSATORY PENAL SYSTEM, IN THE JUSTICE AND PEACE LAW, IN THE POLICY OF SECURITY, IS CLOSEST TO THIS MODERATE MODEL ORIENTED BY LAW, EXPOSED BY JAKOBS, INSTEAD THAT ENEMY CRIMINAL POLICY BASED ON WAR, EXCEPTIONALITY, TOTAL EXTERMINATION OF ENEMY AND IN-DISCRIMINATED VIOLATION OF RIGHTS AND GUARANTIES.
152	IN THE LATE 1970S, THE ECONOMIC SIZE RATIO BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND CHINA WAS 4 TO 1. IN 2001, THE RATIO BETWEEN RUSSIA AND CHINA WAS LESS THAN 1 TO 4, OR EVEN LESS THAN 1 TO 5, IF ONE INCLUDES HONG KONG WITH CHINA. ALTHOUGH THE COLLAPSE AND DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PROFOUND REVERSAL OF ECONOMIC STRENGTH, DOMESTIC FACTORS HAVE BEEN MORE IMPORTANT: DECOLLECTIVIZATION OF CHINESE AGRICULTURE VERSUS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO REFORM IN RUSSIA, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TOWNSHIP VILLAGE ENTERPRISES IN CHINA VERSUS AN EXTREMELY WEAK SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE SECTOR IN RUSSIA, ECONOMIC OPENNESS AND MARKET-PRESERVING FEDERALISM IN CHINA VERSUS LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN GLOBALIZATION AND CONFUSED FEDERALISM IN RUSSIA. ALTHOUGH RUSSIA WAS FASTER THAN CHINA IN PRIVATIZING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, THE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF INSIDERS AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW OR FUNCTIONAL SUBSTITUTES FOR IT NEUTRALIZED THIS POTENTIAL RUSSIAN ADVANTAGE. THE STRENGTH AND CHARACTER OF CHINESE NATIONALISM MIGHT ALSO HELP IT TO OUTGROW RUSSIA. WHILE THE RISE OF CHINA AND THE CORRESPONDING POWER TRANSITIONS IMPLY SECURITY RISKS, REINFORCED BY CHINA'S CENTRAL GEOPOLITICAL LOCATION, THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES, BECAUSE OF THE PACIFYING IMPACT OF FREE TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION AND PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRATIZATION. BY TRADE CHINA MIGHT BECOME PROSPEROUS AND, ULTIMATELY, EVEN DEMOCRATIC. IN THE LONG RUN, A "CAPITALIST PEACE" BETWEEN CHINA, RUSSIA, AND THE WEST IS CONCEIVABLE.
153	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES CURRENT TAX REFORMS IN TANZANIA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS. TANZANIA HAS IMPLEMENTED ECONOMIC REFORMS SINCE THE 1980S. THE GOVERNMENT INITIALLY EMBRACED BUSINESS INTERESTS AND ADOPTED LAISSEZ FAIRE POLICIES THAT LED TO THE NEAR COLLAPSE OF THE TAX SYSTEM AND RAMPANCY OF CORRUPTION. THESE EXPERIENCES SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE TAX SYSTEM. THE SUBSEQUENT REFORMS, BASED ON THE 1991 TAX COMMISSION REPORT ARE THE CORNERSTONES OF TAX REFORM IN TANZANIA AND ARE A CAUSE OF CONCERN. THE FORMAL LEGAL SYSTEM HAS BECOME MARGINAL TO ADMINISTRATIVE RULES AND ENABLES BUREAUCRATIC CHOICES IN THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND ECONOMIC ACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE TAX REFORM HAS NOT CORRECTED FAULTY PRINCIPLES IN STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS IN TAXATION. IT HAS TAKEN A HIGHLY TECHNICAL PATH. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT REFORMING A TAX SYSTEM ON PURELY TECHNICAL ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION IF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT ARE TO BE SUSTAINED. THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE ARTICLE ARE ORGANISED AS FOLLOWS: IN SECTION TWO, THE DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN TAXATION IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED. IN SECTION THREE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF TAXATION IN TANZANIA IS ASSESSED AND EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED TO INDICATE HOW PARLIAMENTARY PLENARY POWERS IN TAXATION HAVE SUPPORTED UNDEMOCRATIC TAX POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE PRACTICES. THE FINAL SECTION ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS.
154	FIGHTING CORRUPTION HAS BEEN A SIGNATURE THEME IN THE GOVERNANCE OF CHINA SINCE XI JINPING BECAME GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CCCPC) IN 2012. AMONG THE EXTENSIVE ATTENTION FROM ACADEMIC AND POLICY DISCOURSE TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORT IN CPC'S HISTORY, THERE ARE STUDIES THAT TAKE THE ONE-SIDED VIEW THAT THE EFFORT UNDER WAY IS NOT ANTI-CORRUPTION IN ITS STRICT SENSE AS IT RELIES ON THE PARTY MECHANISM RATHER THAN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, SCRIPTED, AND CALCULATED FOR THE NARROW SELF-INTEREST OF FACTIONAL POWER ENHANCEMENT. REVIEWING CONTEMPORARY FUNDAMENTAL ANTI-CORRUPTION DISCOURSES, ANCHORED IN CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS, AND ASSISTED BY 134 CIRCULARS OF INTRA-PARTY DISCIPLINARY PUNISHMENTS OF CORRUPT HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS ("TIGERS", DALAOHU), THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY REVEALS THAT, BY CONTRAST, CHINA ADOPTS AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO CORRUPTION, WHICH INCORPORATES REPUBLICAN AND LIBERAL-RATIONALIST BELIEFS AND VALUES. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY CCCPC AS LEADERSHIP, THE CENTRAL COMMISSION FOR DISCIPLINE INSPECTION AS POLITICAL AGENCY, BOTH FOLLOWING A MENTALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND BY THE COORDINATION BETWEEN INTRA-PARTY DISCIPLINARY RULES AND STATE LAWS. THIS APPROACH IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT CONCEPTUALIZES CORRUPTION BY TARGETING THE MAIN FEATURE OF THE CORRUPTION-RELATED PROBLEM. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES FROM A DISCOURSAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S ANTI-CORRUPTION IN THE XI JINPING ERA.
155	OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN LEVIED AGAINST ARTICLE III JUDGES ALLEGING IMPROPER CONDUCT. MANY OF THESE COMPLAINTS, HOWEVER, WERE DISMISSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION AFTER THE JUDGE IN QUESTION REMOVED THEMSELVES FROM THE JURISDICTION OF THE CIRCUIT'S JUDICIAL COUNCIL-OFTENTIMES THROUGH RETIREMENT AND ONCE THROUGH ELEVATION TO THE SUPREME COURT. WHEN JUDGES-THE LITERAL ARBITERS OF JUSTICE WITHIN AMERICAN SOCIETY-ARE ABLE TO ELUDE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR OWN POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT, IT PUTS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN JEOPARDY. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT MECHANISMS ARE ADOPTED THAT WILL ENSURE INVESTIGATIONS INTO JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT ARE COMPLETED, EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS NO LONGER SERVING AS A JUDGE IN THE CIRCUIT WHERE THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED. THIS ESSAY SUGGESTS TWO REFORMS. FIRST, THE ADOPTION OF CUSTOMS THAT WILL REFER ANY SHORT-CIRCUITED INVESTIGATION TO THE STATE BAR AND TO CONGRESS FOR ADDITIONAL INQUIRY. SECOND, THE EXPANSION OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS' AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS SO AS TO ADDRESS THE JURISDICTIONAL LIMITATIONS THAT CURRENTLY ALLOW JUDGES TO CIRCUMVENT ATTEMPTS AT JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT OVER ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. THE STATUS QUO THAT INCENTIVIZES AVOIDING JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE MUST BE REFORMED INTO ONE THAT ALLOWS FOR THOROUGH AND FAIR INVESTIGATION OF THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS OF PUBLIC CONCERN.
156	THE PRESENT PAPER IS BASED ON THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE AUTHORS ON THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF MONTENEGRIN ECONOMY IN THE PERIOD OF 2007-2015. IT IS BASED ON TWO RESEARCH HYPOTHESES. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE COMPETITIVENESS OF NATIONAL ECONOMY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF FDI. THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY APPROACH IN THE PERIOD OF 2007-2015 HAS REFLECTED ON THE INCREASED INFLOW OF FDI, IMPROVING THE RANKING OF MONTENEGRO IN THE COMPETITIVENESS REPORTS ISSUED BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM. THE AUTHORS HAVE PLACED THEIR RESEARCH FOCUS ON A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF FDI ON THE LEVEL OF NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS, AS WELL AS ON AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE RANKING OF MONTENEGRO IN THE COMPETITIVENESS REPORTS. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THE TRANSITION IN MONTENEGRO HAS BEEN HAMPERED FOR YEARS, BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS. HOWEVER, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM, MARKET ECONOMY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND STABLE INSTITUTIONS HAS STARTED TO BE BUILT IRREVOCABLY. ALL OF THE ABOVE HAS AFFECTED THE INFLOW OF FBI AND INCREASED THE LEVEL OF COMPETITIVENESS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. HENCE, THE PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH FDI INFLOW IN THE OBSERVED PERIOD INFLUENCED THE RANKING OF MONTENEGRO IN THE COMPETITIVENESS REPORTS OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM.
157	THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO MAINTAIN SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE PURPOSES OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IS OFTEN TAKEN AS A SIGN OF ITS WEAKNESS. HOWEVER, SUCH JUDGMENTS SAY LITTLE ABOUT THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE FOR GLOBAL EXTRACTION INDUSTRIES AND LOCAL POLITICAL FORCES WHICH DEMAND THEIR SHARE OF THE PIE. WHILST COERCIVE STATE POWER MAY HAVE DECREASED SINCE KYRGYZSTAN BECAME INDEPENDENT, MORE IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT THE STATE ITSELF HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED UNDER THE RUPTURES OF, ON THE ONE HAND, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION AND, ON THE OTHER, THE EFFECTS OF SO-CALLED 'REVOLUTIONS' OF 2005 AND 2010 WHICH LED TO THE WHOLESALE RESTRUCTURING OF NATIONAL STRUCTURES OF CLIENTELISM. BASED ON ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN TALAS PROVINCE, DOCUMENTARY SOURCES AND INTERVIEWS WITH GOLD MINING COMPANIES AND STATE OFFICIALS, THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE STATE'S SHIFTING ROLES WITH RESPECT TO KYRGYZSTAN'S GOLD MINING SECTOR. FIRSTLY, IT EXPLORES THE STATE AS A SOURCE OF RENTS FOR OFFICIALS WHO GRANT AND RESCIND LICENCES IN EXCHANGE FOR FORMAL AND INFORMAL PAYMENTS FROM FOREIGN INVESTORS, OFTEN VIA OFFSHORE VEHICLES. SECONDLY, IT CONSIDERS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AS MEDIATOR BETWEEN FOREIGN INVESTORS AND THEIR ACCESS TO SITES. FINALLY, IT IDENTIFIES THE STATE AS PERFORMER OF ITS STATUS AS SOVEREIGN POWER DESPITE ITS INABILITY TO PREVENT UPRISINGS AND ACTUALLY GUARANTEE THE PROMISED ACCESS TO ITS TERRITORY.
158	CANADA HAS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PORTRAYED A MORAL IMAGE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA. HOWEVER, MANY WOULD AGREE THAT CANADA HAS A MIXED RECORD IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THAT THE PURSUIT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RACIAL EQUALITY IN CANADA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS. CANADA-SOUTH AFRICA RELATIONS RECEIVED A MAJOR BOOST UNDER THE CHRETIEN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE TWO COUNTRIES FORGED CLOSER TIES AND USED MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE COMMONWEALTH TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRACY PARTICULARLY IN AFRICAN STATES. AT THE BILATERAL LEVEL, CANADA SIGNED A FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROMOTION AND PROTECTION AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH AFRICA. MOREOVER, THE LAUNCHING OF THE NEW PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT IN 2001 HELPED TO FURTHER DEEPEN CANADA-SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC RELATIONS. HOWEVER, RECENT CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS OF CANADA'S POLICY, ESPECIALLY THE LOOK TO THE AMERICAS POLICY', RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHERE SOUTH AFRICA SITS ON THE FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA OF CANADA. THIS PAPER LOOKS AT CANADA'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AFRICA IN THE POST-APARTHEID ERA THROUGH THE LENS OF MORAL IDENTITY AND ASKS, WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE HARPER GOVERNMENT'S 'LOOK TO THE AMERICAS' POLICY ON CANADA-SOUTH AFRICA ECONOMIC RELATIONS? AND DOES THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INFORM CANADA'S ECONOMIC POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH AFRICA AFTER APARTHEID?
159	THE ARGUMENTS FOR OR AGAINST THE DIRECT EFFECT ARE BASED ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF IT. IT IS PREFERABLE TO CONSIDER ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN RELATION TO THE COMPLIANCE WITH WTO AGREEMENTS AND ITS MEANING FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHILE SOME PROVISIONS IN THE WTO AGREEMENTS HAVE TOUCHED UPON THE RIGHTS OR THE BENEFITS OF INDIVIDUALS, THE COMPLIANCE REGIME MAINTAINS A FORM BASED ON A PACKAGE OF BILATERAL BALANCES OF CONCESSION. ALTHOUGH THE WTO COMPLIANCE MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FUNCTIONAL, TO SOME EXTENT IT IS NOT EFFICIENT AND NEGLECTS THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEED TO PROTECT HIS RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. THE KEY ISSUE IS HOW THE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE REPRESENTED, WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL NORMS SUBSTANTIALLY REGULATE THE ACTIONS THEREOF. AS FAMILIES OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, AND CONSIDERING THE RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN THE EC LAW AND WTO LAW, THE PRACTICES OF DIRECT EFFECT IN THE FORMER MAY INSPIRE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN WTO LAW. THE EC TREATY DID NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THE ECJ ESTABLISHED THE DOCTRINE OF DIRECT EFFECT, WHICH ENABLED THE INDIVIDUALS TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EC TREATY. THIS SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE OF THE DIRECT EFFECT COULD NOT BE TRANSPLANTED TO THE WTO CONTEXT. UNDER THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE WTO, IT IS INAPPOSITE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE THE DIRECT EFFECT. NONETHELESS, SUBSTANTIAL FACTORS, LIKE RULE OF LAW AND THE NEED FOR PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS, ARE ALSO APPLICABLE IN THE WTO CONTEXT.
160	AFTER 156 YEARS AS A BRITISH COLONY, HONG KONG WILL RETURN TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY, ON JULY 1, 1997. PURSUANT TO THIS TRANSITION, BRITAIN AND CHINA CONCLUDED THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL (CFA) AGREEMENT IN JUNE OF 1995. THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL GOVERN THE FUTURE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF HONG KONG'S SUPREME JUDICIARY. IN REACHING THIS AGREEMENT BRITAIN MADE A NUMBER OF CONCESSIONS TO CHINA, MOST IMPORTANTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE CFA'S JURISDICTION. THE CFA'S IMPAIRED JURISDICTION, ENSURED BY VIRTUE OF THE AGREEMENT'S PROVISIONS REGARDING ACTS OF STATE, CONFERS ON THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CFA ADJUDICATES. SUCH CONTROL HAS FRIGHTENING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG. CHINA'S INTERFERENCE WITH THE CFA, MOREOVER, RUNS CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS INSTRUMENTS REGARDING THE CFA. IN COMING TO THESE CONCLUSIONS THIS NOTE REVIEWS THE HISTORY OF THE CFA AS PROVIDED FOR IN EARLIER DOCUMENTS; HONG KONG'S TRADITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HONG KONG COURTS' COMMON LAW JURISDICTION; AND THE AGREEMENT AND IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION'S JURISDICTION PROVISIONS, PARTICULARLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH HONG KONG'S POST-1997 CONSTITUTION. THIS NOTE ALSO COUNTERS SEVERAL OF THE HONG KONG ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE CFA AGREEMENT AND ITS IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION.
161	THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL IN THE CRIMINAL LAW, WHERE LIBERTY AND EVEN LIFE ARE AT STAKE. YET THE REASONS FOR SEPARATING CRIMINAL POWERS ARE SURPRISINGLY OPAQUE, AND THE "SEPARATION OF POWERS" IS OFTEN USED TO REFER TO DISTINCT, AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY, CONCEPTS. THIS ARTICLE REEXAMINES THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN CRIMINAL LAW. IT ASKS WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT SEPARATING CRIMINAL POWERS AND WHAT VALUES SUCH SEPARATION SERVES. IT CONCLUDES THAT IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE, THE TRADITIONAL MADISONIAN APPROACH OF SEPARATING POWERS BETWEEN FUNCTIONALLY DIFFERENTIATED POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS LEGISLATURE, EXECUTIVE, AND JUDICIARY BEARS NO NECESSARY CONNECTION TO IMPORTANT VALUES LIKE PRESERVING LIBERTY, PREVENTING TYRANNY, AND SAFEGUARDING THE RULE OF LAW. NOT ONLY IS ADHERING TO THE TRADITIONAL MADISONIAN APPROACH TO SEPARATION OF POWERS INSUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE THESE VALUES, IT IS LIKELY UNNECESSARY TO PROTECT THEM AS WELL. INSTEAD OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR THE STRUCTURE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE DISTINCT IDEA OF "CHECKS AND BALANCES." A CHECKS-AND-BALANCES APPROACH WOULD EMPHASIZE THE DIFFUSION OF DECISIONMAKING POWER AMONG DIFFERENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INTERESTS IN SOCIETY; FUNCTIONAL DUPLICATION AND OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT DECISIONMAKERS; INSULATION OF DECISIONMAKING POWER BY INDIVIDUAL ACTORS WITHIN SINGLE INSTITUTIONS, ALONG WITH MORE FORMAL CHECKING ROLES FOR NON-STATE ACTORS; AND CAREFUL DESIGN TO OPTIMIZE ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
162	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ELABORATE A CRITICAL APPROACH TO FERRAJOLI'S CONCEPTION OF EQUITY. ITS AUTHOR UNDERTAKES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS ON THE COGNITIVIST CONCEPTION OF JURISDICTION TO BE FOUND IN THE ITALIAN AUTHOR, PARTICULARLY ON THE ROLE PLAYED BY EQUITY THEREOF ( AS "POWER OF CONNOTATION" COMING ALONG WITH THE "DENOTATION POWER", "FACT FINDING POWER" AND "ETHICAL-POLITICAL DISPOSITION POWER" OF THE JUDGE) USING FOR THIS PURPOSES ARISTOTLE'S CLASSICAL THEORY ON EQUITY. IN THIS COMPARISON, FERRAJOLI'S POSITIVIST MODEL IS CONFRONTED WITH ARISTOTLE'S PRAGMATIC MODEL OF RULES AND WITH JUDICIAL DELIBERATION AS PRACTICAL REASONING, THIS LATTER DERIVED FROM HIS NOTION OF "PRUDENCE" UNDERLYING THE CONCEPT OF EPIEIKEIA AS "CORRECTION OF THE LAW". IT IS THEN THAT THE DEFICIENCIES OF FERRAJOLI'S APPROACH TO JURISDICTION, BASED ON A CONCEPTION OF THE NOTION OF TRUTH FOLLOWING THE POSITIVIST FACT-VALUE DICHOTOMY, ARE OBSERVED. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT FERRAJOLI'S THESIS ON EQUITY AS "CONNOTATION OF WHAT IS DENOTED BY THE LAW" AND "UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE" REALLY TANTAMOUNT TO THE CLASSICAL FORMALIST CONCEPTION ON JURISDICTION. MOREOVER IT IS ARGUED THAT HOLDING THIS UNDERSTANDING OF JURISDICTION TURNS FERRAJOLI'S POSITIVIST CONSTITUTIONALISM INCONSISTENT. FOR THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE-OF-LAW STATE, NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS INSEPARABLE FROM THE NOTION OF TRUTH AS PRACTICAL CORRECTION AND FROM THE METHODICAL IDEAL OF COHERENCE.
163	WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON STATE BEHAVIOR ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN EXTENDING, PROMOTING, AND PROTECTING POLITICAL AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, FORMAL OR "PARCHMENT" GUARANTEES OF GOVERNMENT RESTRAINT AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT NECESSARILY ENSURE THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WILL BE OBSERVED IN PRACTICE. ONE PERSISTENT AND WIDESPREAD EXAMPLE OF SUCH LACK OF RESTRAINT IS THAT OF OFFICIAL IMPUNITY, OR THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR AGENTS ARE BOUND BY THE SAME LAWS THAT APPLY TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION. UNPUNISHED VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY STATE AGENTS ARE WIDESPREAD AND ARE FOUND ACROSS A RANGE OF REGIME TYPES AND DEVELOPMENT LEVELS. FOR THIS PAPER I HAVE CREATED A MEASURE OF IMPUNITY BASED ON DATA FROM U. S. STATE DEPARTMENT HUMAN RIGHTS COUNTRY REPORTS, SUPPLEMENTED WITH DATA FROM AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, FOR 158 COUNTRIES; THIS INDICATOR PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL DIMENSION TO OTHER MEASURES OF "RULE OF LAW" AND OFFICIAL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THIS DATA SUGGESTS THAT OFFICIAL IMPUNITY IS WORSE IN POLITIES FACING DOMESTIC CRISES AND LOW LEVELS OF PER CAPITA INCOME, AND THAT THE PREVALENCE OF IMPUNITY DECREASES DRAMATICALLY WITH PRESS FREEDOM. IN FACT, PRESS FREEDOM MAY BE A MORE EFFECTIVE TOOL IN CURBING OFFICIAL IMPUNITY THAN FORMAL DEMOCRACY, WHICH RESULTS IN EPISODIC RATHER THAN CONSTANT PRESSURE ON ABUSIVE AND POORLY CONTROLLED MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES.
164	THAT EMOTION SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN LEGAL DECISION-MAKING HAS BEEN SEEN AS INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. RECENT NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH, HOWEVER, HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT EMOTION PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN LEGAL DECISION-MAKING, IN PARTICULAR THE CRIMINAL LAW WHERE PERSONAL, SOCIAL, AND MORAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CONSIDERED. THE HIGH COURT RECENTLY CONSIDERED JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING IN MARKARIAN V THE QUEEN, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SENTENCING, WHERE THE MAJORITY PUTATIVELY UPHELD THE "INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS" APPROACH. LABELS ASIDE, THIS ARTICLE WILL EVALUATE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES PROPOSED BY THE JUDGES, AND POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES, IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE NEUROBIOLOGICALLY. THIS WILL INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF WHICH OF THE APPROACHES TO SENTENCING ARE MOST CONSISTENT WITH RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, TOGETHER WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF EMOTION. THE ARTICLE WILL CONCLUDE THAT, IN MARKARIAN, THE HIGH COURT IN FACT UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE EARLIER FORM OF WILLISCROFT "INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS", WHICH WAS THE SENTENCING METHOD MOST LIKELY TO ALLOW UNREGULATED EMOTION TO BIAS DECISIONS. THE COURT HAD PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF DECISION-MAKING, MARKARIAN SYNTHESIS, WHICH ALLOWED AN ESSENTIAL ROLE FOR EMOTION, BUT INCLUDED THE SAFEGUARD OF PROCESSES MORE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH REASON AND DELIBERATION. IN THIS, THE COURT ENDORSED A FORM OF DECISION-MAKING WHICH WAS CONSISTENT, NEUROBIOLOGICALLY, WITH THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD OF ARRIVING AT RATIONAL, WELL INFORMED, YET HUMANE DECISIONS.
165	NEXTGENERATIONEU, THE RECOVERY PROGRAMME ADOPTED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, DID NOT PROVIDE THE EU WITH FISCAL SOVEREIGNTY. FISCAL SOVEREIGNTY REMAINS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MEMBER STATES WHICH ARE, HOWEVER, CONSTRAINED BY THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT. COMPARATIVE FEDERALISM SHOWS THAT CENTRAL FISCAL SOVEREIGNTY REQUIRES GRANTING THE POWER TO TAX TO THE CENTRE BUT WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE FISCAL SOVEREIGNTY OF THE UNITS. THE CO-EXISTENCE OF TWO DISTINCT, YET CONNECTED, FISCAL SOVEREIGNTIES (EU AND MEMBER STATES) WOULD MEAN DEPARTING FROM THE REGULATORY MODEL OF FISCAL INTEGRATION CREATED WITH THE MAASTRICHT TREATY, AND WOULD THUS REQUIRE TREATY CHANGE. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD PERFORM A MORE THOROUGH COMPARISON BETWEEN THE EU AND FISCALLY CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED FEDERATIONS. QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS COULD COMPLEMENT PROCESS TRACING AND SYSTEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY COMBINATIONS OF CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THE CO-EXISTENCE OF FISCAL SOVEREIGNTIES POSSIBLE IN CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL POLITIES - AND STILL IMPOSSIBLE IN THE EU.

166	URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING IN CHINA HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, URBANIZATION, AND INTEGRATED DISASTER DRIVERS ON URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING HAZARDS, STARTING FROM THE DISASTER-CAUSING MECHANISMS OF URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING IN CHINA. THIS PAPER THEN ANALYZES THE MAIN FEATURES AND PROGRESS OF URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING GOVERNANCE IN CHINA. IN PARTICULAR, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PROGRESS OF SPONGE CITIES IN CHINA. ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE CONTENTS, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE FRAGMENTATION DILEMMA AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE, NAMELY, FRAGMENTATION IN VALUE INTEGRATION DUE TO CONFLICTING MANAGEMENT ORDERS AND SERVICE VALUES, FRAGMENTATION IN RESOURCE AND POWER ALLOCATION DUE TO THE LACK OF VERTICAL TOP-LEVEL DESIGN AND BLURRED HORIZONTAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT BOUNDARIES, AND FRAGMENTATION IN POLICY FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION DUE TO OUTDATED URBAN FLOOD CONTROL STANDARDS AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL INFORMATION COMPARTMENTALIZATION. IN RESPONSE TO THE FRAGMENTATION DILEMMA IN URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING MANAGEMENT IN CHINA, THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF HOLISTIC GOVERNANCE AND CLARIFIES THE PATH OF URBAN WATERLOGGING MANAGEMENT, I.E., FORMING A COLLABORATIVE AND DIVERSIFIED GOVERNANCE SUBJECTS, DEEPLY OPTIMIZING THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF URBAN WATERLOGGING MANAGEMENT, CREATING A MATURE INFORMATION-BASED GOVERNANCE PLATFORM, AND IMPROVING THE LEGAL AND RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION MODEL. THIS PAPER IS INFORMATIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GOVERNANCE OF URBAN PLUVIAL FLOODING IN CHINA FROM A GOVERNMENT-LED MANAGEMENT LEVEL.
167	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS AT ELABORATING WHETHER THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ILLICIT ENRICHMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN EFFICIENT AND WELL-BALANCED MEASURE AGAINST PROFITING FROM SERIOUS CRIME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY OFFERS A NORMATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ILLICIT ENRICHMENT, PARTICULARLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. THIS PAPER SUPPLEMENTS THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS USING LITHUANIA, WHERE ILLICIT ENRICHMENT WAS CRIMINALIZED A DECADE AGO, AS A CASE STUDY. IT ANALYSES DATA OF ALL 28 KNOWN CRIMINAL CASES ON ILLICIT ENRICHMENT THAT RESULTED IN JUDGEMENTS IN LITHUANIA IN 2015-2019. FINDINGS THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT ON NEITHER A FUNDAMENTAL NOR PRACTICAL LEVEL CAN THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ILLICIT ENRICHMENT EFFICIENTLY CARRIES OUT THE TASK FOR WHICH IT WAS CREATED BE SUPPORTED. MOREOVER, EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGAL STRATEGY MIGHT UNBALANCE THE SYSTEM OF ILLICIT ASSET RECOVERY MEASURES AND OBSTRUCT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OTHER PROMISING LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE AS VERY FEW STATES WITH DEVELOPED DEMOCRACY AND STRONG RULE OF LAW TRADITIONS HAVE IMPLEMENTED CRIMINALIZATION OF ILLICIT ENRICHMENT, THERE ARE VERY FEW IF ANY EMPIRICAL DATA OR ANALYSIS OF PRACTICES ON THIS ISSUE THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE THEORETICAL DISCUSSION. THIS PAPER AIMS AT CONTRIBUTING TO FULFILLMENT OF THIS GAP BY PRESENTING RELEVANT DATA AND INSIGHTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LITHUANIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
168	JUDICIAL ARMS OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES (RECS) IN AFRICA ARE TODAY ACTIVE ADJUDICATORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASES. ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO MAINLY DEAL WITH CASES REGARDING REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND TRADE, THE COURTS OR TRIBUNALS OF RECS HAVE IN THE LAST TWO DECADES RECEIVED AND DETERMINED A SOLID STREAM OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASES. THIS ARTICLE CONCERNS ITSELF WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICE OF THE EAST AFRICAN COURT OF JUSTICE (EACJ), A SUB REGIONAL COURT OPERATING UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY (EAC). IT EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH EAC MEMBER STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLIED WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS DECISIONS OF THE EACJ. IT IS LOCATED WITHIN AND ADDS ONTO THE RELATIVELY NEW BODY OF LITERATURE ON COMPLIANCE WITH DECISIONS OF SUB-REGIONAL COURTS IN AFRICA. IN SIX HUMAN RIGHTS CASES IN WHICH THE EACJ FOUND A VIOLATION OF THE EAC TREATY, THE ANALYSIS FINDS FULL OR PARTIAL COMPLIANCE IN THREE. ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE OF CASES ANALYSED IS SMALL, THE ARTICLE POINTS TO IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ON FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF COMPLIANCE. THESE INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE, QUICK RESOLUTION OF CASES BY THE EACJ AND THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE OR LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN MEMBER STATES. AS THE EACJ IS ONLY AS STRONG AS ITS PARENT ORGANISATION, A MORE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF THE EAC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH EACJ DECISIONS IS IMPERATIVE.
169	HAVING BEEN INVITED BY EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, PROFESSOR ANNE WAGNER, TO EDIT THE PRESENT SPECIAL ISSUE, WE DECIDED TO FULFIL A LONGSTANDING WISH TO PROVIDE A PANORAMA ABOUT THE HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE AND LAW. ALONG WITH OTHER 'LAW AND HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS ' MOVEMENTS, LAW AND LANGUAGE HAS ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION FROM SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS OF HUNGARIAN ACADEMIC LAWYERS, BECAUSE THE POLITICAL TRANSITION SERVED AS A WONDERFUL SUBJECT AND CONTEXT FOR SCHOLARLY PAPERS AND TEXT BOOKS, FOR EXAMINING THE PUTATIVE OR REAL INFLUENCE OF THIS OR THAT POPULAR SOCIAL SCIENTIST OR FOR UNDERTAKING LITERATURE OVERVIEWS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY FEW ACADEMIC PAPERS THAT HAVE SOUGHT TO DRAW GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROM EMPIRICALLY WELL-FOUNDED CASE STUDIES. IN ORDER TO FILL THAT IMPORTANT GAP, THIS SPECIAL ISSUE HAS TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT ONLY THOSE INTERDISCIPLINARY PAPERS WHOSE GOALS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF HUNGARIAN LEGAL DISCOURSE WRITTEN FROM A CRITICAL ANGLE AND USING CRITICAL EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY. AT THE VERY OUTSET OF THE EDITING PROCESS-BACK IN 2018-FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE WE DEFINED AS 'EMPIRICAL' ANY SUFFICIENTLY COHERENT FACT-BASED RESEARCH THAT REFLECTS THE LANGUAGE OF LEGAL DISCOURSE. AND 'CRITICAL' MEANS AN ENGAGEMENT WITH THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS DOUBLE METHODOLOGICAL AND AXIOLOGICAL FEATURE IS MANIFEST THROUGHOUT THE SELECTED PAPERS CLASSIFIED AS 'LAW AND LANGUAGE'.
170	THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL CIVIL PROCEDURE SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY'S REFORM AND OPENING TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. AS A LARGE ECONOMIC COUNTRY, CHINA NEEDS TO DRAW ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL PROCEDURES TO GUARANTEE ITS WORLDWIDE INTERESTS; AND AS A LARGE COUNTRY WITH THE RULE OF LAW, IT NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF ITS JUDICIAL SERVICES AND ENHANCE THE MARKET ATTRACTION OF ITS JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN GLOBAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. GIVEN THAT A COUNTRY'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN MEASURING ITS COMPREHENSIVE COMPETITIVENESS, THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CIVIL PROCEDURE IS ONE OF THE GOALS TO BE PURSUED IN THE REFORM OF CHINESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF CHINESE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL PROCEDURE, CHINA SHOULD EMPHASIZE THE IDEA OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF A LARGE COUNTRY AND PRIORITIZE ITS COMPETITIVENESS, SERVICE ORIENTATION AND COOPERATIVE APPROACH TO DISPUTE RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION, IT SHOULD FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING REFORMS: FIRSTLY, ESTABLISHING A SPECIALIZED SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL CIVIL JURISDICTION, WITH AN INCREASE IN MATTERS FOR COMPETITIVE JURISDICTION; SECONDLY, ENHANCING CHINA'S SPECIALIST SERVICES CAPACITY IN INTERNATIONAL CIVIL ACTIONS, HIGHLIGHTING THE EXPEDIENT PROTECTION GIVEN TO THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES CONCERNED AND STRESSING THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL BODIES IN THE COMMERCIAL FIELD; AND THIRDLY, STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL COOPERATION AND FACILITATING THE GLOBAL MOVEMENT OF CHINESE JUDGMENTS.
171	A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ADOLESCENT AND ADULT MALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN PHYSICAL AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE THAN FEMALES ARE. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED CROSS-CULTURAL VARIATION IN SEX DIFFERENCES, PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES [LMICS]. BASED ON SOCIAL ROLE AND SEXUAL SELECTION THEORIES, WE DERIVED TWO HYPOTHESES REGARDING POSSIBLE VARIATIONS IN SEX DIFFERENCES ACROSS SOCIETAL CONTEXTS: 1) SEX DIFFERENCES INCREASE WITH SOCIETAL GENDER POLARIZATION (SOCIAL ROLE THEORY) AND 2) SEX DIFFERENCES ARE EXACERBATED IN SOCIETIES WHERE SOCIO-ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ARE SCARCE, UNEQUAL, OR INSECURE (PREDICTION DERIVED FROM SEXUAL SELECTION THEORY). THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE OF AND VARIATION IN SEX DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL AGGRESSION, AS MEASURED BY FREQUENT FIGHTING, AMONG 247,909 ADOLESCENTS IN 63 LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, OVERALL, MALES WERE OVER TWICE AS LIKELY (OR = 2.68; 95% CI = 2.60-2.76) TO REPORT FREQUENT FIGHTING IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS THAN FEMALES. HOWEVER, SEX DIFFERENCES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS LMICS, WHEREIN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER FEMALE PREVALENCE RATES HAVE SMALLER SEX DIFFERENCES IN FREQUENT FIGHTING. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS DERIVED FROM SOCIAL ROLE THEORY, SEX DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL AGGRESSION DECREASE AS SOCIETAL GENDER INEQUALITY INCREASED. IN REGARDS TO SEXUAL SELECTION THEORY, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT SEX DIFFERENCES IN FREQUENT FIGHTING VARIES ACCORDING TO SOCIETAL RULE OF LAW OR INCOME INEQUALITY.
172	FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, PIVOTAL IN DEFINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL, EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. HOWEVER, THE POSITION OF FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS IN THIS RESPECT HAS REMAINED SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED. THIS IS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE CONSIDERING THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE, A NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILE FRICTIONS HAVE APPEARED BETWEEN NATIONAL, EU AND INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S CASE LAW IN THE VIKING AND LAVAL CASES AND AS REGARDS THE AUSTERITY MEASURES TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS. THE PRESENT ARTICLE MAPS THESE FRICTIONS, CONSIDERS TO WHAT EXTENT THEY CONSTITUTE PROBLEMATIC CONFLICTS THAT CHALLENGE THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITIES FOR RESOLVING THEM. IT IS CONTENDED THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE NECESSARY FOR THE EU TO ACCEDE TO THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL CHARTER OR INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION CONVENTIONS, WHICH WOULD POSE PROBLEMS FOR THE AUTONOMY OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER. INSTEAD, IT IS ARGUED FIRST THAT MOST PROBLEMS CAN BE AVOIDED BY UNDERLINING THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MEMBER STATES MORE STRONGLY; AND SECOND THAT THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MORE GENERALLY, SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED WITH CARE TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT SPACE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO DEFINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SOCIAL PROTECTION IN RELATION TO OTHER SOCIETAL VALUES AND RIGHTS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC ONES.
173	THIS ARTICLE "ROADMAP FOR ENSURING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN ISLAMIC PERSPECTIVE" IS A REFLECTION OF THE DIFFERENT DUTIES AN ISLAMIC STATE IS BOUND TO DISCHARGE IN RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC & CULTURAL CAPACITY. ISLAM BEING A COMPLETE CODE OF LIFE NOT ONLY REGULATES THE LIVES OF CITIZENS BUT ALSO SHOWS FUTURE DIRECTION TO A STATE TO REFORM AND IMPROVE ITSELF SO AS TO BECOME A TRUE WELFARE STATE. ACCORDING TO ISLAM, INDIVIDUAL IS THE END AND STATE IS THE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THAT END HENCE THIS ARTICLE COMPLETELY EMBODIES MULTIPLE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ISLAMIC STATE I-E PROCLAIMING PEACE, JUSTICE, EQUITY, RULE OF LAW, JIHAD, ISLAMIC DEMOCRACY, EDUCATION AND SYSTEM OF SALAH AND ZAKAT LEADING TO A REFORMED WELFARE STATE IN TRUE SENSE OF THE TERM. THESE MULTIFARIOUS CONCEPTS WERE GIVEN TO MUSLIMS 1400 YEARS AGO AND CAME IN THE FORM OF HOLY QURAN AND THE SUNNAH. NO NATION CAN PROGRESS UNLESS THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE APPLIED AND PURSUED IN SOCIETY AT ALMOST ALL LEVELS OF STATE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, ISLAM IS THE ONLY RELIGION THAT GUIDES US TOWARDS ATTAINING THE GOAL OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THERE ARE SEVERAL QURANIC VERSES THAT HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE AND ROADMAP FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE FROM ISLAMIC VIEWPOINT. THIS STUDY IS AN EFFORT TO REVITALIZE THE SAME CONCEPTS BY DELVING DEEPER INTO THE SPIRIT OF ISLAM WITH RESPECT TO CALIPHATE & ISLAMIC STATE.
174	FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL CRITICISM WE CAN DEFINE BORDERS AS THE PRIVILEGED SPACE OF SOCIAL INEQUITIES. IT IS IN THESE AREAS WHERE UNJUST INEQUALITIES BECOME MORE EXTENSIVE AND DEEPER, VIOLATING THE SET OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAN IN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES MUST ENSURE THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. THE PREDOMINANCE OF A RESTRICTED VIEW OF THE BORDER AS RED ZONE TORPEDOES THE CHANCES OF A COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC POLICY OF ATTENTION TO THESE AREAS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MULTICULTURALISM AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CULTURAL DIALOGUE, PROMOTE STRATEGIES FOR EXPLOITING THE HUGE POTENTIAL PRESENT IN THE AREA FOR DEVELOPMENT AND WELFARE OF THESE TOWNS. UNTIL NOW, WE HAVE LACKED AN INTEGRATED PUBLIC POLICY BORDER THAT ADDRESSES THE MOST BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS, DESIGNED TO RAISE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE BORDER USING STRATEGIES FOR BORDER DEVELOPMENT THAT STIMULATES THE POLITICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES THAT MEETS THE SOCIO-GEOGRAPHICAL REALITY OF THE BORDER. THE BIOETHICAL IMPERATIVE OF SOCIAL WORK DEMANDS US THE ACTIVATION IN THE BORDER SPACES OF OUR VARIOUS ROLES AS AGENTS OF SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION. THAT WE MAY, THROUGH OUR FUNCTIONS, UNDERSTAND THE ELEMENTS THAT UNDERLIE THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE OF THE TOWNS OF BORDER, THEIR CAPABILITIES AND POTENTIALS TO CONQUER THEIR RIGHTS, BY REDIRECTING PUBLIC POLICIES TO THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BORDER.
175	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE IMPACT, UP UNTIL 2009, OF THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI). THE EITI IS AN INTERNATIONAL POLICY INTERVENTION THAT AIMS TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE BY PROMOTING THE TRANSPARENCY OF RESOURCE REVENUES AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF RESOURCE RICH STATES. ITS EFFECTIVENESS CAN BE ASSESSED BY EXAMINING TWO OUTCOMES THAT ARE SUGGESTED TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY RESOURCE ABUNDANCE: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. THROUGH A PANEL STUDY, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 200 COUNTRIES, THE INFLUENCE OF THE EITI IN THESE TWO AREAS IS EXAMINED. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ON GDP PER CAPITA, THE CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT SOUND POLICIES AND THE LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW IS MITIGATED IN EITI COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE EITI HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND CORRUPTION. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE SOME EARLY INDICATIONS THAT THE EITI HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROTECTING SOME NATIONS FROM SELECTED ELEMENTS OF THE RESOURCE CURSE. THIS IS ENCOURAGING GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SHORT TIME PERIOD SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE EITI, HOWEVER THE MIXED RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A SIMILAR STUDY SHOULD BE REPEATED IN 5 TO 10 YEARS WHEN EM POLICIES HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO FULLY TAKE EFFECT.

176	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE POSSIBLE IMPACT THAT THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW MAY HAVE ON CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA. AS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE COMMON PROBLEMS WE FACE TODAY, THE PHENOMENA OF INTERNATIONALIZATION HAS SEEN THE INCREASING WILLINGNESS OF LEGISLATURES AND JUDICIARIES TO LOOK BEYOND THE NATIONAL BOUNDARIES FOR SOLUTIONS TO DOMESTIC LEGAL PROBLEMS. IN SPITE OF SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1990S, AFRICA IS STILL FACED WITH NUMEROUS CHALLENGES. AFTER SHOWING THAT THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW NEVER EXCLUDED SOME ROLE FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE FIRST SECTION OF THE PAPER PROCEEDS TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IS INFLUENCING, RESHAPING AND IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, REPLACING DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES. IT THEN CONSIDERS SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS ON DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. IT IS SHOWN THAT, IN SPITE SOME CRITICISM OF THIS PROCESS AS AN INFRINGEMENT OF SOVEREIGNTY, THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW NEVERTHELESS ACTS AS A SORT OF COMPENSATORY CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE REACH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS IN DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ARE LIKELY TO EXPAND IN THE FUTURE AND ARE CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING THE MOMENTUM FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM IN AFRICA AT A TIME WHEN OMINOUS SIGNS OF AUTHORITARIAN REVIVAL ARE EMERGING.
177	GROCERY SHOPPING IS ONE OF THE MOST NECESSARY EVERYDAY PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES TO BEING FOOD SECURE. FOOD SECURITY IS FREQUENTLY SPATIALLY IMAGINED ALONG TWO AXES - ACCESS AND HEALTH. I HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE FOR FOOD INSECURE CITIZENS IN WINNIPEG TO DEMONSTRATE THE INCOMMENSURABILITY OF HOW FOOD INSECURITY IS IMAGINED AND INTERVENED UPON, OR NOT, THROUGH MUNICIPAL POLICY. DRAWING ON CRITICAL INDIGENOUS STUDIES SCHOLAR AILEEN MORETON-ROBINSON'S THEORIZATIONS OF "WHITE POSSESSION," I ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK OF WHITE POSSESSIVE SECURITIZATION TO INTERROGATE THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN POLICY, POLICING, AND THE SECURITIZATION OF SPACE THAT RESULTS IN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BEING SUBJECTED TO MULTIPLE MODES OF POLICING WHEN GROCERY SHOPPING. WITH WHITE POSSESSIVE SECURITIZATION, I TRACE HOW INDIVIDUAL SETTLER CITIZENS OPERATE AS SELF-GOVERNING SUBJECTS TO POLICE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE CITY WHILE CARRYING OUT THE AIMS OF WHITE PATRIARCHAL SOVEREIGNTY - TO SECURE PRIVATE PROPERTY. I PROVIDE THREE VIGNETTES OF THE INTERSECTIONS OF MUNICIPAL POLICY AND THE POLICING OF FOOD BY FOCUSSING ON MUNICIPAL BUDGETS, THE SECURITIZATION OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE SPACE, AND GROCERY STORES. THESE VIGNETTES DELINEATE HOW POLICING IN GROCERY STORES INTERFERES WITH INDIGENOUS FOOD SECURITY AND ARE INSEPARABLE FROM INFLATED MUNICIPAL POLICING BUDGETS, AUSTERITY MEASURES THAT REDUCE COMMUNITY SERVICES, INCREASED SURVEILLANCE, THREATS OF VIOLENCE, AND THE UNDISCRIMINATING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW BY INDIVIDUAL SETTLER CITIZENS WHO THROUGH RATIONALITIES OF GOVERNMENTALITY ARE THE POLICE.
178	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE WHETHER ANNOUNCEMENTS OF MANDATORY SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE AFFECT CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE (CSP). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS USE A QUASI-EXPERIMENT PROVIDED BY MANDATORY SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 21 COUNTRIES FROM 2006-2016. A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES METHOD IS ADOPTED. THE AUTHORS RESTRICT THE DRAWING OF ALL CANDIDATE TREATMENT AND CONTROL FIRMS TO A POOL OF FIRMS THAT DID NOT DISCLOSE SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION ONE YEAR BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF MANDATORY SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO CSP. THE POSITIVE EFFECT IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR FIRMS IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER ANTICIPATION EFFECTS AND LOWER AWARENESS EFFECTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE EFFECT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS HIGHER AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO INITIATE COMMUNICATION ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY WITH FIRMS, AND WITH FEWER ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN AND SIGNATORIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT INITIATIVE. THE FINDINGS HOLD UNDER DIFFERENT ROBUSTNESS ANALYSES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE STUDY ENRICHES THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE MANDATORY SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE BY ANALYSING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS. IN THE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS GROWING STREAM OF RESEARCH, THE AUTHORS PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS BASED ON A CROSS-COUNTRY SAMPLE AND IMPORTANTLY, FOCUSSES ON THE NON-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.
179	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN EXPLAINING THIS RELATIONSHIP USING PANEL DATA OF 18 TOP NUCLEAR POWER-CONSUMING COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1995-2017. IT IS THE FIRST RESEARCH EFFORT THAT INCORPORATES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS INTO THE NEXUS BETWEEN NUCLEAR ENERGY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. FOR THIS REASON, WE EMPLOY AN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDEX WHICH CONSTITUTES A COMPOSITE MEASURE OF CORE INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY EFFICIENCY. THE RESULTS OF FIRST AND SECOND-GENERATION PANEL UNIT ROOT AND COINTEGRATION TESTS REVEAL A LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH, NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMPTION, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, REAL GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION, AND LABOR FORCE. THE POOLED MEAN GROUP ESTIMATION SHOWS THAT NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LONG RUN. IN CONTRAST, HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS A NEGATIVE LONG-RUN IMPACT ON THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER. FURTHERMORE, IT IS ONLY OBSERVED A UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSAL EFFECT FROM ECONOMIC GROWTH TO NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE SHORT RUN. GIVEN THE GLOBAL CONTROVERSIES OVER THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR POWER IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, OUR FINDINGS IMPLY THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE COUNTRIES THAT CONSIDER NUCLEAR ENERGY AS A LONG-TERM CLEAN ENERGY OPTION HAS TO BE REASSESSED.
180	THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN AID IS TYPICALLY MEASURED BY THE EFFECT OF AID ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. PRIOR LITERATURE PROVIDES AMBIGUOUS RESULTS ON THIS EFFECT PARTLY DUE TO THE AGGREGATION OF AID TO DIFFERENT SECTORS AND THE SMALL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN AID RELATIVE TO THE ECONOMY IN MOST COUNTRIES. BECAUSE GROWTH IN FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH, IN THIS PAPER WE FOCUS ON AID TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND SEEK TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF FOREIGN AID TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ON FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION. USING FIXED EFFECTS OLS AND SYSTEM GMM METHODS FOR A PANEL OF COUNTRIES FROM 1993 TO 2016, WE FIND THAT FOREIGN AID TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR PRIMARILY INCREASES CLAIMS ON THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR, AND HAS NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL EFFECT ON CLAIMS TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND NO EFFECT ON LIQUID LIABILITIES OF THE BANKING SECTOR AND INTEREST RATE SPREAD BETWEEN BORROWING AND LENDING RATES. THIS EFFECT PERSISTS EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS TRADE OPENNESS AND RULE OF LAW. THUS, FOREIGN AID INCREASES PUBLIC SECTOR BORROWING BUT DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY BENEFITS FOR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE VERIFY THAT THE RELATION IS NOT SPURIOUS BY USING AID TO THE HEALTH SECTOR FOR FALSIFICATION TESTS.
181	THE UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE INTRODUCTION AND SUBSEQUENT RISING OF WELFARE STATE (NANNY STATE) MAKE THE INSTITUTION VULNERABLE TO CRITICS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ECONOMISTS. UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE CAUSED CHRONIC BUDGET DEFICIT AND INCREASING PUBLIC DEBT BURDEN DURING PEACETIME. UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE DEFENSE IS USUALLY BASED ON THE FOLLOWING TWO CLAIMS: UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE IS AN INTEGRAL AND BASIC COMPONENT OF REAL RULE OF LAW DEMOCRACY AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HAS CLEAR MORAL ADVANTAGES COMPARED WITH CENSUS LIMITED PARTICIPATION. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THE MORAL FOUNDATION OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE IS EVEN LESS SOLID THAN ECONOMIC. UNDESERVED PRIVILEGE IS ENCOURAGING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO DROP THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES, WHILE SECURING THEIR "RIGHT" TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S FATE ON THE DAY OF ELECTIONS. NEW IRRESPONSIBLE AND BUDGET DEPENDENT VOTERS CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BUREAUCRATS SEEKING DISCRETION POWER AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THEIRS BUREAUS. WE STRESS REASONABLE DOUBT ABOUT LONG RUN COMPATIBILITY OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE WITH CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY (LIKE PROPERTY RIGHTS, FREE SPEECH AND MORE). SUPPORTERS OF THE WELFARE STATE REQUIRE THAT THEIR POWER TO RIG ELECTIONS BE SECURED FOR THE SAKE OF FIGHTING DISCRIMINATION. THE SAME PEOPLE OFTEN REQUIRE THAT VOTES OF THEIR OPPONENTS BE IGNORED (I.E. EFFECTIVELY DENYING OPPONENTS' "RIGHT TO VOTE"). AS A RESULT, ONE COULD OBSERVE NOW PRETTY BROAD CONSENSUS ON THE NECESSITY TO INTRODUCE (TO RESTORE) QUALIFICATIONS FOR VOTING.
182	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RECENT EVOLUTION OF CHINA'S POLICIES TOWARD THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT (R2P) CONCEPT IN THE CONTEXT OF A CHANGING INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN EMERGING NON-WESTERN' ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXISTING NORMATIVE CONSENSUS, THE CHINESE PERCEPTION OF THE NORM REFLECTS THE NATURE OF THE ONGOING NEW EAST-WEST DIVIDE AND IS DERIVED FROM BEIJING'S NEW VISION OF A FUTURE WORLD ORDER AND CHINA'S ROLE IN IT. IN 2001-2011, CHINA SUPPORTED R2P AS A NEW MECHANISM TO REVISE WESTERN PRACTICES OF HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTIONISM AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CHANGING MULTILATERAL GLOBAL INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER EXEMPLIFYING CHINA'S NEW STATUS AS A RESPONSIBLE GLOBAL CITIZEN'. WHEN THE R2P NORM WAS POLITICIZED BY THE WEST AS PART OF ITS GLOBAL DEMOCRATIC INTERVENTIONIST POLICIES OF 2005-2014, CHINA'S PREDOMINANTLY GLOBALIST VISION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW WAS REPLACED BY ITS PREDOMINANTLY SECURITY-DRIVEN APPROACH. THIS PERSPECTIVE, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE ONGOING GLOBALIZATION OF SOVEREIGNTY, CALLS FOR A RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN JUSTICE AND INTEREST' BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND DENIES THE TRADITIONAL WESTERN LEADERSHIP IN THE NORM-MAKING PROCESS. THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) LEADERS BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE R2P CONCEPT SHOULD MEET CHINA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING ITS GLOBAL ORDER-FORMING AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING INITIATIVES. EFFORTS TO OPERATIONALIZE THE R2P NORM WILL HAVE TO TAKE THIS FACTOR INTO ACCOUNT.
183	THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS LED THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND WITH A NEW FORM OF REGULATION. "REGULATION BY DEAL" BENT THE RULE OF LAW TO RESCUE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH TRANSACTIONS AND FORCED INVESTMENTS; IT MAY HAVE HELPED TO SAVE THE ECONOMY, BUT IT FAILED TO OBSERVE A LAUNDRY LIST OF BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. WE EXAMINE THE AFTERMATH OF THIS KIND OF REGULATION THROUGH THE LENS OF THE CURRENT LITIGATION BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS AND THE GOVERNMENT OVER THE FUTURE OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. WE CONCLUDE THAT WHILE REGULATION BY DEAL HAS A PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL CRISIS TOOLKIT, THERE MUST COME A TIME WHEN THE LAW AGAIN TAKES FIRM HOLD. THE SHAREHOLDERS OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, WHO HAVE SOUGHT DAMAGES FROM THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF ITS DECISION TO ELIMINATE DIVIDENDS PAID BY THE INSTITUTIONS, SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO REVIEW OF THEIR CLAIMS FOR ENTIRE FAIRNESS AS PART OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT REMEDY A SOLUTION THAT BLENDS CORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. OUR APPROACH WILL DISCIPLINE THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF REGULATION BY DEAL IN FUTURE ECONOMIC CRISES AND PROVIDE SOME GROUND RULES FOR ITS EXERCISE AT THE END OF THIS ONE WITHOUT PROVIDING ACTIVIST INVESTORS, WHO WE CONTEND ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN REGULATION, WITH AN UNWARRANTED WINDFALL.
184	WE OFFER A MULTILEVEL META-ANALYTIC STUDY OF THE FIRM PERFORMANCE - EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION RELATIONSHIP, COMPRISING PRIOR TESTS DERIVED FROM 332 PRIMARY STUDIES NESTED IN 29 COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH OUR WORK MODESTLY SUPPORTS THE OPTIMAL CONTRACTING THEORY-BASED EXPECTATION THAT COMPENSATION IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE, IT ALSO REVEALS CONSIDERABLE CROSS-COUNTRY VARIABILITY IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. WE TRACE THIS VARIANCE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS PROTECTING INVESTORS AGAINST MANAGERIAL OVERCOMPENSATION AND UNDERPERFORMANCE. IN TERMS OF INTENTIONALLY DEVISED AND ENFORCED FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, WE FIND SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE MODERATING EFFECTS ON THE FOCAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE RULE OF LAW AND STRENGTH OF INVESTOR PROTECTION VARIABLES. FOR SELF-ENFORCING INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, WE FIND SIMILAR EFFECTS FOR CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP AND COMPENSATION-RELATED ENTRIES IN CODES OF GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. WE ALSO FIND THAT FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS FUNCTION IN A COMPLEMENTARY MANNER IN SHAPING THE PERFORMANCE SENSITIVITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THE FOCAL RELATIONSHIP BECOMES STRONGER WHEN CONCENTRATED OWNERS HAVE ACCESS TO WELL-FUNCTIONING COURTS, AND WHEN INFORMAL NORMS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE SUPPORTED BY SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION LAWS. OUR STUDY THUS SUGGESTS THAT OPTIMAL CONTRACTING THEORY MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH AN INSTITUTION-BASED VIEW, TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CONDITIONING EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON NATIONAL CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENTS.

185	THE STUDY DRAWS INFERENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, LIBERALIZATION, AND GOVERNANCE ON MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION (MVA) IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE LONGRUN IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FACTORS, AND FOR PURPOSES OF RETAINING ESTIMATES EFFICIENCY AND CONSISTENCY IN THE PRESENCE OF COMPLEX ERRORS, WE EMPLOYED THE PANEL-CORRECTED-STANDARD-ERROR ESTIMATOR ON PANEL DATA SPANNING 2003-2018 FOR 30 SSA COUNTRIES. THE MAIN RESULT OF THIS IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS GOVERNANCE ARE KEY TO MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION. WHILE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AFFECTS MVA POSITIVELY IN THE LONGRUN, AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FINANCIAL OPENNESS FACILITATES THIS LINKAGE BUT ONLY BETWEEN TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE ONE HAND, AND ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE OTHER, WHEREAS THE CONVERSE APPEARS THE CASE WHEN TRADE LIBERALIZATION IS THE MODERATING VARIABLE. OVERALL, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF LIBERALIZATION, MANUFACTURING OUTPUT IS ALWAYS HIGHER WITH BETTER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. OUR FINDINGS HOLD AFTER CONTROLLING TO ADDITIONAL COVARIATES AND ARE ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATION MEASURES. AMONG THE OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY DERIVATIVES OF OUR FINDINGS, WE EMPHASIZE THAT EFFORTS AIMED AT REVERSING AFRICA'S PERVASIVE INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT, IN WAYS THAT ENHANCE MANUFACTURING SHARE IN GDP, MUST BE CAREFULLY NUANCED UNDER THE AVOIDANCE OF THE INCAUTIOUS LIBERALIZATION POLICIES. WE RENDER SUPPORT TO THE REGIONAL EFFORTS TO IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE, SUBSTANTIALLY CURB POOR GOVERNANCE WHILE VIGOROUSLY PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
186	AS THE RULE OF LAW CAN NOT RECOGNIZE RIGHTS WITHOUT PROVIDING THE NECESSARY MECHANISM FOR EXERCISING AND SAFE GUARDING THEM BEFORE IT SELF, ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROVIDED FOR AS IT COVERS ASPECTS OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR LIFE IN SOCIETY. HOWEVER, THIS RIGHT DID NOT ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME CONNOTATION, AND THUS, LIKE MANY OTHERS, IT WAS INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY OVER TIME, ADDING NEW ASPECTS AND RIGHT-HOLDERS. IN FACT, THROUGH OUT THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY, PEOPLE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE LEGAL CAPACITY ACQUIRED IT, LIKE BLACK PEOPLE. CURRENTLY, THE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON THE MORAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATION OF ANIMALS, WHICH REFERS TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ATTRIBUTION OF RIGHTS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN THE ORDER. THEREFORE, IN THIS ARTICLE, THE KEY CRITERIA OF LEGAL CAPACITY IN BRAZILIAN LAW WERE ANALYZED, AND THE SOLIDITY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF RECOGNIZING THE LEGAL CAPACITY OF ANIMALS WAS VERIFIED, WITH THE DEDUCTIVE METHODOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS. THE PERSPECTIVE EXTRACTED FROM THERE SEARCH WAS THAT, BASED ON THE TECHNICALITY OF THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF PERSON/SUBJECT TO FLAW AND SOME SUPPORT IN THE THEORY OF MARGINAL CASES, THERE IS NO CONCRETE OBSTACLE TO THERE COGNITION OF THE ABILITY TO BE PART OF ANIMALS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOTABLE TO BE IN COURT, AND MUST BE REPRESENTED OR REPLACED, ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATION.
187	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE SYNERGIES AND CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (CBD) AND THE EUROPEAN UNION TIMBER REGULATION (EUTR), AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE CBD PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE IN IMPROVING COHERENCE ACROSS THESE DIVERSE FOREST-RELATED AGREEMENTS. WE FIND THAT BOTH THE EUTR, WHICH AIMS TO ELIMINATE ILLEGAL WOOD FROM EU SUPPLY CHAINS, AND THE CBD, WITH ITS CORE FOCUS ON BIODIVERSITY AND HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS, SHARE THE STATED GOALS OF SAFEGUARDING BIODIVERSITY AND LOCAL LIVELIHOODS. HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPLE OF INCLUSIVE GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE USE EMBEDDED IN THE CBD CONFLICTS WITH THE EUTR. THE EUTR FOCUS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSERTS THE PRIMACY OF STATE LAWS INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR SUSTAINABILITY CONTENT AND ALIGNMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. WE FIND THAT THE EUTR RISKS REINFORCING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS THAT PREFERENCE LARGE-SCALE EXPORT PRODUCTION OVER LOCAL FOREST ACCESS, USE AND BENEFITS. BETTER ALIGNING THE EUTR WITH CBD SAFEGUARDS FIRSTLY REQUIRES OPENING-UP THE EUTR RULE-MAKING PROCESS TO BROADER ENGAGEMENT WITH AFFECTED GROUPS. SECONDLY, OUR ANALYSIS OF BOTH THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE DIMENSIONS OF THE EUTR AND THE CBD SAFEGUARDS, SUGGESTS THAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER ALIGNMENT LIE IN THE NEXUS BETWEEN PROCEDURAL RIGHTS, OF WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT FORMS PART OF A BROADER VISION OF RULE OF LAW AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION, AND THE STRENGTHENING OF SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS THAT BENEFIT LOCAL FOREST USE AND CONSERVATION.
188	THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS WITH OPINION-MAKERS IN TURKEY IN 2012 TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF COOPERATION BETWEEN TURKEY AND NORWAY ON ISSUES OF PEACEBUILDING. NORWAY WAS VIEWED BY RESPONDENTS AS A COUNTRY WITH SOFTPOWER CAPABILITIES AND A FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC VALUES, AND THE RULE OF LAW. SOME OPINION-MAKERS ALSO EMPHASIZED THAT BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE A SIMILAR POSITION ON PALESTINE, A PIVOTAL ISSUE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, THE LACK OF COMMON INSTITUTIONS, NORWAY'S LACK OF EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES AND FAITHS, NORWAY'S FAILURE TO OBJECT TO THE 2005-2006 DANISH CARTOON SCANDAL REGARDING MOHAMMED, NORWEGIAN CRITICISM OF TURKEY'S POLICIES TOWARD THE KURDS, AND ITS IMPRISONMENT OF DISSIDENTS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW. DESPITE THESE ISSUES, RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED ENTHUSIASM ABOUT FUTURE COOPERATION, AND VIEW NORWAY AS A FAR BETTER POTENTIAL COLLABORATOR THAN ANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRY, IN PART BECAUSE IT, LIKE TURKEY, IS OUTSIDE THE EU BUT A MEMBER OF NATO. THE ISSUE OF TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN NORWAY'S USE OF SOFT POWER AND ITS ECONOMIC ASPIRATIONS, NAMELY OIL INVESTMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WAS ALSO EXPLORED. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT INCREASED COOPERATION BETWEEN TURKEY AND NORWAY MAY GIVE RISE TO "TURKOPHOBIA", AN EXTENSION OF "ISLAMOPHOBIA", A SIMPLISTIC INTERPRETATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT RESTS ON CULTURAL MISUNDERSTANDING AND MISCOMMUNICATION.
189	IN RECENT YEARS, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA HAS EXPANDED POLICE POWERS AND HAS UPHELD THOSE POWERS AGAINST CHARTER CHALLENGES. THIS TREND HAS BEEN CRITICIZED, MOST NOTABLY BY JAMES STRIBOPOULOS, WHO HAS ARGUED THAT THE EXPANSION OF POLICE POWERS IS AT ODDS WITH AV DICEY'S CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY WITH THE DOCTRINE OF STRICT CONSTRUCTION. STRIBOPOULOS CLAIMS THAT RECOGNIZING NOVEL POLICE POWERS, DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF ANY EXPRESS LEGISLATIVE GRANT, CREATES UNCERTAINTY FOR CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF OBSTRUCTION OFFENCES WHICH CARRY SERIOUS PENAL CONSEQUENCES. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT STRIBOPOULOS OVERSTATES THE CENTRALITY OF THE "DICEYAN MODEL" TO CANADIAN LAW. IN SEVERAL PRE-CHARTER OBSTRUCTION CASES, THE COURT EFFECTIVELY ADOPTED A THIN ICE PRINCIPLE-THE IDEA THAT CITIZENS SKATE ON THIN ICE WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN CONDUCT WHICH HAS ARGUABLY BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE LEGISLATURE, SO THEY SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN IF THEY ARE ULTIMATELY PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED. THE AUTHOR AGREES THAT THE THIN ICE PRINCIPLE IS IN TENSION WITH THE DICEYAN MODEL, SO HE PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE: AN ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL. THIS MODEL IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT POLICE OFFICERS OUGHT TO HAVE DISCRETION, SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ACTORS, TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH CHARTER RIGHTS SHOULD YIELD TO PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS. WITHOUT CLAIMING THAT THIS ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL IS CATEGORICALLY SUPERIOR TO THE DICEYAN MODEL, THE AUTHOR NOTES IT HAS DISTINCT ADVANTAGES.
190	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ESSAY IS TO INTRODUCE THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION ON LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR (CLEP) TO THE BROADER ACADEMIC COMMUNITY INTERESTED IN THE CHALLENGE OF ERADICATING RURAL POVERTY AND PROMOTING THE STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES WHICH UNDERPIN SUCH A CHALLENGE. WHILE RURAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH IN THE PAST HAS INCLUDED WORK ON SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF THE LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR (LEP) AGENDA SUCH AS PROPERTY AND LABOUR RIGHTS, MUCH LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE OTHER TWO PILLARS OF THE FRAMEWORK-ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW AND BUSINESS RIGHTS-WHICH TOGETHER CONSTITUTE THE FOUR PILLARS OF LEP. HOWEVER THE REAL DIFFERENCE AND VALUE ADDED IS THE POWER OF THE SYSTEMIC INTERACTION AMONG THE PILLARS AND THE EMPOWERMENT APPROACH TO CHANGE. IN THIS APPROACH, CHANGE IS INITIATED BOTTOM UP WITH LEGAL IDENTITY, ORGANISATIONS, INFORMATION, AND VOICE OF THE POOR. IN OTHER WORDS AN ACTIVE CITIZENRY, COMPLEMENTED BY A DEMOCRATIC AND EFFECTIVE STATE. NONE OF THIS HAPPENS NATURALLY AS VESTED INTERESTS AND SKEWED POWER AND ASSET RELATIONSHIPS ARE BOUND TO GET IN THE WAY OF CHANGE TO GREATER EQUITY. SUCH CHANGE IS ONLY LIKELY TO COME THROUGH ITERATIVE CONTESTATIONS BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS OF THE POOR, THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND THE STATE. THIS APPROACH IS NOT PRESENTED AS A PANACEA BUT ONE WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY COMPLEMENT AND ACCELERATE WHAT IS ALREADY WORKING.
191	WHALE-WATCHING TOURISM GENERATES HIGH-INCOME SEASONAL LIVELIHOODS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES ON THE MEXICAN PACIFIC COAST; HOWEVER, THIS SECTOR IS AT RISK FROM ACCELERATED GLOBAL CHANGES. WE EVALUATED THE RESPONSES OF A COLLABORATION OF TOURISM NETWORKS REGARDING THE IMPACTS COVID-19 USING A LONGITUDINAL SOCIAL NETWORK APPROACH. WE USED A TWO-WAVE SNOWBALL METHOD TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL INTERVIEWEES AND FOLLOWED GEOGRAPHIC AND JURISDICTIONAL CRITERIA USING A FACE-TO-FACE SURVEY TO MAP COLLABORATION TIES BETWEEN 38 STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN WHALE-WATCHING TOURISM BEFORE AND AFTER THE SECOND WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO ASKED THIS GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THEIR PERCEIVED IMPACTS OF COVID-19. WE FOUND SLIGHTLY HIGHER CONNECTIVITY AND CENTRALIZATION LEVELS IN THE SOCIAL NETWORKS AFTER THE PANDEMIC. LOSS OF INCOME AND RESERVATIONS, A DECREASE IN BOTH CONSERVATIONS AND POLLUTION, AND AN INCREASE IN THE REDUCTION IN WILDLIFE TOURISM WERE THE MAIN SELF-REPORTED IMPACTS. WE ALSO DETECTED HARMFUL PANDEMIC LEGACIES, SUCH AS WHALE-WATCHING TOURS CONDUCTED USING UNREGULATED PRIVATE BOATS. THIS RESEARCH DIRECTLY INFORMS MEXICO'S WHALE-WATCHING TOURISM POLICY BY SHOWING THE MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION CHALLENGES THAT STAKEHOLDERS FACE IN A POST-PANDEMIC CONTEXT. WHILE THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN RESILIENT TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE FOUND INDICATIONS THAT THE GOVERNANCE OF MARINE RESOURCES CAN EASILY UNRAVEL IF RULE OF LAW IS ABSENT.
192	THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS THAT AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH. AMONG OTHERS, ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, BAD GOVERNANCE, AND EXTENSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE REGARDED AS MORE DESTRUCTIVE FOR HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES. TO EXPLORE THE NEXUS OF THE SAID FACTORS AND EXTEND THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE, THE CURRENT STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS, GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) ON HUMAN HEALTH EXPENDITURES-CAPTURED BY DOMESTIC HEALTH EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY CONTRASTED VARIABLES INCLUDING REGULATORY QUALITY (RQ), RULE OF LAW (RL), GDP, GHG EMISSIONS, AND HUMAN CAPITAL (HC) WITH THAT OF HUMAN HEALTH EXPENDITURE. COVERING THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2020, THIS STUDY USES TIME SERIES SPECIFICATIONS IN THE CASE OF CHINA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST POLLUTION-EMITTING ECONOMIES ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS FOUND THAT THE LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN THE VARIABLES. FOR THE LONG-RUN COEFFICIENTS, THIS STUDY UTILIZES THE FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, AND CANONICAL COINTEGRATION REGRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND RQ ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTING HUMAN HEALTH EXPENDITURE. HOWEVER, GHG EMISSIONS, RQ, AND HC SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE HUMAN HEALTH BY INCREASING HEALTH EXPENDITURE IN CHINA. BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS, POLICIES ARE SUGGESTED REGARDING HUMAN HEALTH IMPROVEMENT, IMPROVED GOVERNANCE QUALITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE STUDY DISCUSSES THE EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS AS PER COP26 DECLARATIONS.
193	THIS ARTICLE ARTICULATES A GENERAL THEORY OF SHAM, UNDERSTANDING IT AS A SPECIES OF FRAUD UNIQUELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE DECEPTIVE MISUSE OF AN OTHERWISE VALID LEGAL FORM TO DEFEAT A SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW OR POLICY. IT THEN CONSIDERS TWO THEORETICAL QUESTIONS UNDERLYING THE DESIGN AND STRUCTURE OF CIVIL REMEDIAL DOCTRINES THAT PROTECT POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND CLAIMANTS AGAINST FRAUDULENT SHAM TRANSFERS. FIRST, SHOULD A SHAM AVOIDANCE DOCTRINE REQUIRE EVIDENCE OF THE CHALLENGED WRONGDOER'S SUBJECTIVE FRAUDULENT INTENT, OR SHOULD THE DOCTRINE ALTERNATIVELY ALLOW FOR MORE OBJECTIVE PROOF, SUCH AS CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF SURROUNDING FACTS INDICATIVE OF A SHAM TRANSFER? SECONDLY, IS A BRIGHT-LINE RULE PROHIBITION OR A HOLISTIC STANDARD FOR EX POST EVALUATION MORE LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE AS A REMEDY FOR SHAM TRANSACTIONS, AND HOW DO CONCERNS ABOUT EFFICIENCY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW WEIGH IN THIS RENDITION OF THE RULES-VERSUS-STANDARDS DEBATE? THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE FRAUDULENT TRANSFER DOCTRINE AS THE DOMINANT APPROACH FOR ADDRESSING SHAM TRANSACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH IMPOSES A STANDARD RATHER THAN A RULE, AND ALLOWS FOR PROOF OF EITHER SUBJECTIVE FRAUDULENT INTENT OR OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF BADGES OF FRAUD IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHALLENGED TRANSACTION. THE ARTICLE THEN SURVEYS OTHER SPECIALIZED SHAM AVOIDANCE DOCTRINES, DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS ABUSIVE TAX TRUSTS AND SPOUSAL DISINHERITANCE, WHICH ILLUSTRATE EXPERIMENTATION WITH BOTH SUBJECTIVE STATE-OF-MIND CRITERIA AND RULE-BASED PROHIBITIONS, WITH MIXED RECEPTION AND SUCCESS.
194	IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT OUTCRY AGAINST THE INVESTOR STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT ("ISDS') SYSTEM, THE NEGOTIATORS TO THE PROPOSED EU-U.S. TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP ("TTIP') HAVE DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF INVESTMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION: THE SO-CALLED INVESTMENT COURT SYSTEM ("ICS'). NEWS AGENCIES, POLITICAL LEADERS, AND LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE PUBLISHED MYRIAD REACTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL, MANY OF THEM MIXED THIS NOTE EVALUATES THE ICS IN LIGHT OF THE MOST COGENT CRITIQUES LODGED AGAINST ISDS, BEFORE CONSIDERING THREE ALTERNATIVE MODES OF INVESTMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION: A RETURN TO THE PRE-ISDS ERA, THE ADOPTION OF A RULE-OF-LAW RATINGS MECHANISM, AND A REFORMED AND UPDATED VERSION OF ISDS. DUE TO THE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE DESIGN OF THE ICS INCLUDING MOST NOTABLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT ITS JUDGES WOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO STATE INTERESTS THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT IT PRESENTS AN IMPERFECT SOLUTION TO ISDS'S CRITIQUES. INSTEAD, A REVISED VERSION OF ISDS, UPDATED TO INCORPORATE CERTAIN COST-REDUCTION STRATEGIES, REGULATORY SAFEGUARDS, AND A MULTILATERAL ISDS APPELLATE MECHANISM, THEORETICALLY OFFERS THE MOST PROMISING LONG-TERM AVENUE FOR DEALING WITH THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES INHERENT IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICAL AND POLITICAL REALITIES OF TTIP, NAMELY THE SOURING OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT TOWARDS ANYTHING ISDS, THE MOST VIABLE SOLUTION OPEN TO NEGOTIATORS IS A RETURN TO THE PRE-ISDS ERA.
195	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INTEGRATE TWO MAIN STRANDS OF THE AID-DEVELOPMENT NEXUS IN ASSESSING WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL THRESHOLDS MATTER IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN-AID ON INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN 53 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2010. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSION TECHNIQUE ENABLES US TO INVESTIGATE IF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE DIFFERS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS. EIGHT GOVERNMENT QUALITY INDICATORS ARE EMPLOYED: RULE OF LAW, REGULATION QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY. FINDINGS - THREE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED AND THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED: FIRST, INSTITUTIONAL BENEFITS OF FOREIGN-AID ARE CONTINGENT ON EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL LEVELS IN AFRICA; SECOND, BUT FOR A THIN EXCEPTION (DEMOCRACY), FOREIGN-AID IS MORE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH COUNTRIES OF HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAN WITH THOSE OF LOWER QUALITY; THIRD, THE INSTITUTIONAL BENEFITS OF FOREIGN-AID ARE NOT QUESTIONABLE UNTIL GREATER DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE REVERSE IS TRUE INSTEAD. GOVERNMENT QUALITY BENEFITS OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ARE QUESTIONABLE IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES IRRESPECTIVE OF PREVAILING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY LEVELS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO EXISTING LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN-AID BY FOCUSSING ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES (INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS). IT IS LIKELY THAT BEST AND WORST COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONS RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.
196	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE DEMONSTRABLE NEED FOR STRUCTURED INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN A WORLD OF INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE POLITICAL STRAIN THAT ARISES WHENEVER POLICYMAKING AUTHORITY IS LODGED IN GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS. IT ARGUES THAT THE TOOLS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WHICH HAVE BEEN USED TO LEGITIMATE REGULATORY DECISIONMAKING IN THE DOMESTIC CONTEXT, SHOULD BE DEPLOYED MORE SYSTEMATICALLY WHEN POLICYMAKING IS UNDERTAKEN AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE INEVITABLE LACK OF DEMOCRATIC UNDERPINNINGS FOR SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS A SERIES OF OTHER BASES FOR LEGITIMACY: EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL WELFARE; THE ORDER AND STABILITY PROVIDED BY THE RULE OF LAW; CHECKS AND BALANCES; STRUCTURED DELIBERATION; AND, MOST NOTABLY, THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF THE POLICYMAKING PROCESS AS STRUCTURED BY PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IN DEVELOPING THE LOGIC FOR PROCEDURAL LEGITIMACY AS A FOUNDATION FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AT THE SUPRANATIONAL SCALE, THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A TAXONOMY OF POSSIBLE GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TOOLS. IT THEN EVALUATES AGAINST THIS TEMPLATE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE PROCEDURES SOME EXISTING DECISIONMAKING PROCEDURES IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY REGIMES. THE CORE CONCLUSION IS THIS: EVEN IF SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNANCE IS LIMITED AND HAMPERED BY DIVERGENT TRADITIONS, CULTURES, AND POLITICAL PREFERENCES, DEVELOPING A BASELINE SET OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TOOLS AND PRACTICES WILL STRENGTHEN WHATEVER SUPRANATIONAL POLICYMAKING IS UNDERTAKEN.
197	ASIA'S SHARE OF MANUFACTURING EXPORT TO GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN THE 1990S WAS MORE THAN FIVE TIMES THAT OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. WHILE EXPLANATIONS ABOUND IN THE LITERATURE AS TO WHY AFRICA HAS FAILED, RECENT EMPIRICAL WORK SUGGESTS THAT THE REASON FOR AFRICA'S DISMAL EXPORT PERFORMANCE LIES IN A LOW SKILL-TO-LAND RATIO, WHICH CAUSES ITS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE TO LIE IN PRIMARY EXPORTS. THIS RESULT IS DERIVED FROM A BASIC 2 X 2 HECKSHER-OHLIN MODEL. HOWEVER, THE AGGREGATION INHERENT IN THE INDUSTRY OR NATIONAL LEVEL DATA SETS THAT ARE USED FOR TESTING THIS THEORY HIDES SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY. INPUT INTENSITY HETEROGENEITY VIOLATES THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE FACTOR PROPORTIONS FRAMEWORK AND CASTS DOUBTS ON THE RELIABILITY OF ESTIMATION RESULTS. MOREOVER, MEASUREMENT ERROR ON THE SKILL VARIABLE AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL CAUSES BIASES IN ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION. THIS PAPER USES A COMBINED MICRO- AND MACRO-LEVEL DATA SET FOR INVESTIGATING THE DETERMINANTS OF EXPORT PERFORMANCE IN ASIA AND AFRICA'S MANUFACTURING. TOBIT ESTIMATIONS FIND NO ROBUST ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SKILL INTENSITY AND EXPORT PERFORMANCE IN THE TEXTILE AND GARMENT INDUSTRIES IN GHANA, KENYA AND INDIA. AFRICA AND ASIA'S SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE GAP MIGHT BE BETTER EXPLAINED BY THERE BEING POORER INSTITUTIONS IN AFRICA AS MEASURED BY THE KNACK AND KEEFER (1995) INDEX AND KAUFMAN ET AL.'S (1999) 'RULE OF LAW' COMPOSITE INDEX.
198	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB), SUPPORTED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU), CAN BE PERCEIVED TO HAVE FUNCTIONALLY SOFTENED THE NO SOVEREIGN LENDER OF LAST RESORT (LOLR) RULE ORIGINALLY IMPLIED BY ARTICLES 123 AND 125 OF THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (TFEU) TOWARDS A RULE-WITH-EXCEPTIONS AND, INCREASINGLY, TOWARDS A PRESUMPTION: THE ECB WILL ACT AS SOVEREIGN LOLR TO A CONSTITUENT MEMBER UNLESS AND UNTIL THAT MEMBER IS INSOLVENT OR UNWILLING TO COOPERATE WITH MEASURES DESIGNED TO RESTORE MARKET CONFIDENCE. THIS FUNCTIONAL MODERATION OF A RULE, FROM AN EX ANTE SPECIFICATION OF AN OUTCOME TOWARDS THE EXERCISE OF GREATER CHOICE AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION, CARRIES WITH IT CONTENTIOUS NORMATIVE QUESTIONS. TO MOTIVATE DISCUSSION THEREOF BEYOND A LARGELY AHISTORICAL, NON-INDEXICAL, RULES VERSUS DISCRETION DEBATE, THE RULES OF THE CURRENCY UNION ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE GENEALOGY OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES. THE "CONVERTIBILITY" RULE OF THE GOLD STANDARD AND THE "PARITY" RULE OF THE BRETTON WOODS SYSTEM ARE CONTRASTED WITH THEIR EUROZONE EQUIVALENT. A CONSEQUENTIALIST STANDPOINT IS SKETCHED OUT FROM WHICH THE INTERVENTIONS OF THE ECB, IN LIGHT OF THEIR AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES, APPEAR BROADLY CONSISTENT WITH WELFARIST COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND LESS NORMATIVELY WORRISOME THAN BY REFERENCE TO EVALUATIVE CRITERIA THAT EMPHASIZE A NARROWLY RULE-BOUND CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
199	AT A TIME WHEN HUMANITY FINDS ITSELF ENVELOPED BY CONFLICTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS, VIOLENCE, GREED AND CRIMES AT VARIOUS LEVELS, THE WORLD HUNGERS FOR PEACE AND NONVIOLENCE. THE UNITED NATIONS TALKS ABOUT HOW CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE 'ARE CURRENTLY ON THE RISE'. IT TALKS OF THE RISING INVOLVEMENT OF NON-STATE ACTORS LIKE POLITICAL MILITIAS, CRIMINAL AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS. AMONGST THE DOMINANT FORCES BEHIND CONFLICTS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS ARE UNRESOLVED REGIONAL TENSIONS, BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW, ABSENT OR CO-OPTED STATE INSTITUTIONS, ILLICIT ECONOMIC GAIN AND THE SCARCITY OF RESOURCES. THE AIM IS TO CONSTANTLY WORK TO FIND FRAMEWORKS AND PRACTICAL MODELS TO END THESE CONFLICTS. THE CHALLENGE IS NOT JUST TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR CESSATION OF THESE CONFLICTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THESE VIOLENCE. IN MOST OF THESE CONFLICTS, THERE ARE ATTEMPTS TO ENCOURAGE SANITIZATION OF LANGUAGE AND DISTORT REALITY; IN MANY OCCASIONS THERE IS USE OF LANGUAGE TO DEMONIZE GROUPS AND NORMALIZE VIOLENCE. COMMUNICATION HENCE CAN BE SAID TO FUEL ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE - DIRECT, STRUCTURAL AND CULTURAL. USING CASE STUDIES OF INTEGRATING MAHATMA GANDHI'S NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE PAPER WILL LOOK AT HOW THIS APPROACH OF NONVIOLENT COMMUNICATION CAN HELP IN BRINGING CHANGE IN ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR OF THE CONFLICTING PARTIES AND AID IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT.
200	THE NEED FOR SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION AMONG ECONOMIES AND AN EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE SYSTEM TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED. OVERRELIANCE ON BIOMASS AND OTHER DIRTY FUELS FOR COOKING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGE. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION AND GOVERNANCE ON ADOPTING CLEAN FUELS AND COOKING TECHNOLOGIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). REGARDING ANALYTICAL APPROACHES, WE DEPLOY ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DRISCOLL-KRAAY AND INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT TECHNIQUES TO CONTROL ECONOMETRIC ISSUES SUCH AS AUTOCORRELATION, HETEROSKEDASTICITY, CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCE, AND ENDOGENEITY. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GLOBALIZATION (ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL) AND GOVERNANCE (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW) DRIVE THE ADOPTION OF CLEAN FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR COOKING. THE RESULTS FURTHER REVEAL THAT RIGHT-WING POLITICAL LEADERS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ADOPTING CLEAN COOKING FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES IN SSA, WHILE LEFT-WING AND CENTER-WING POLITICAL LEADERS DO NOT. THESE FINDINGS DIFFER AMONG THE SUB-REGIONS IN SSA. FURTHERMORE, INTERACTION AND MARGINAL EFFECT ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT IMPROVING GOVERNANCE SYSTEM ENHANCES THE EFFECT OF GLOBALIZATION ON ACCESS TO CLEAN COOKING FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES. HENCE, IMPROVING THE EFFICACY OF THE DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE SYSTEM COULD ENABLE GLOBALIZATION TO SPEED UP THE ADOPTION OF CLEAN FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR COOKING IN SSA.
201	DURING ITS MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF OPERATION, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS PROVEN TO BE A REAL BEACON FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS. THROUGH ITS CASE LAW, IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AS WELL AS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE. HOWEVER, THE COURT FACES TWO CENTRAL PROBLEMS: THE CASELOAD IT HAS TO DEAL WITH AND CHALLENGES TO ITS AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION WILL STUDY THE HISTORY AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COURT, AND ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND THE COURT'S RESPONSE TO THEM. THE LATTER HAS PARTICULARLY INCLUDED MEASURES AIMED AT MAKING ITS WORKING METHODS MORE EFFECTIVE AND ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF ITS SUBSIDIARY ROLE WITHIN THE CONVENTION PROTECTION SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY REGARDING ITS APPROACH TO THE REVIEW OF DECISIONS OF NATIONAL AUTHORITIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROCESS-BASED REVIEW IN THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE IS EXAMINED. WHAT WILL CHARACTERIZE THE CONVENTION SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE IS CLOSER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE COURT AND NATIONAL COURTS. WHETHER THIS WILL EFFECTIVELY LEAD TO AN INCREASED PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE GROUND REMAINS TO BE SEEN. IT IS NOT ONLY FOR THE COURT TO EARN SUCH CONFIDENCE THROUGH ITS WORK, BUT ALSO FOR OTHERS TO MAINTAIN A CLIMATE IN WHICH THAT CONFIDENCE CAN CONTINUE TO BE ENJOYED.
202	THE CZECH REPUBLIC, TOGETHER WITH OTHER POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL EUROPE, STILL STRUGGLES (NEARLY 30 YEAR AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM) TO BUILD A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY AND TO PERFORM DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND GOOD GOVERNMENT, SECURING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN OUR OWN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CHANGES OCCURRING ON A MUNICIPAL LEVEL IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. WE HAVE SURVEYED THREE SMALL-SIZED TOWNS THAT HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY PERFORMED - WITHIN OUR RESEARCH TIMEFRAME - SOUND DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND GOOD GOVERNMENT. THIS MULTI-CASE STUDY COMBINES BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS AIMED AT BOTH THE LOCAL POLITICAL ELITES AND THE CIVIL PUBLIC, AND THEIR MUTUAL REFLEXIVITY. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE THREE TOWNS PERFORMED DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AND GOOD GOVERNMENT, DESPITE VERY LITTLE (OR THE ABSENCE OF) POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE LOCAL CIVIL PUBLIC. HOWEVER, IN ALL CASES, THE LOCAL POLITICAL FACTIONS PERFORMED CRUCIAL LEGITIMIZING AND DELIBERATIVE FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS WEAKNESS. IN THE ONE METROPOLITAN SUBURBAN TOWN IN OUR STUDY, COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO PERIPHERAL TOWNS, A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF CIVIC ELITES RESULTED IN A GREATER INTENSITY OF PROTEST-LIKE PARTICIPATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE BUILDING OF A STRONGER POLITICAL REPUTATION WAS MORE DIFFICULT. SURPRISINGLY, IN ALL THREE TOWNS, WE FOUND NO CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND THE ORIENTATION TOWARDS LIBERAL VALUES.
203	JUDGES ARE INCREASINGLY ASKED TO DECIDE WHETHER A RULE OF NATIONAL LAW IS APPLICABLE TO A CYBERSPACE ACTOR WHO IS NOT PRESENT IN THEIR JURISDICTION, OR WHOSE ACTIVITIES DO NOT CLEARLY FALL WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE. THEY DO THIS THROUGH INTERPRETING THE APPLICABILITY AND MEANING OF THE LAW. EVERY ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE A NATIONAL LAW MAKES A CLAIM THAT THE LAW HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE CYBERSPACE ACTOR. BY ACCEPTING THAT CLAIM, THE JUDGE ASSERTS THAT THE LAW'S CLAIM IS LEGITIMATE. THIS IS A HARTIAN EXERCISE, ADOPTING THE INTERNAL VIEW OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM AS THE TEST FOR LEGITIMACY. BUT IN CYBERSPACE THE LEGITIMACY OF A NATIONAL LAW CLAIM IS DETERMINED NOT BY THE INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BUT BY THE EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE OF CYBERSPACE ACTORS. A LAW WILL ONLY HAVE AUTHORITY IN CYBERSPACE IF IT CAN CONVINCE CYBERSPACE ACTORS THAT ITS CLAIM IS LEGITIMATE. AND A LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH REPEATEDLY MAKES ILLEGITIMATE CLAIMS THEREBY WEAKENS ITS STATUS AS A SYSTEM WHICH ADHERES TO THE RULE OF LAW. JUDGES CAN HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY INTERPRETING LAWS AND APPLYING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW SO AS TO REJECT APPLICABILITY CLAIMS WHICH ARE ILLEGITIMATE. TO DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY, THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE JURISPRUDENTIAL FOUNDATIONS OF ANY LAW'S AUTHORITY IN CYBERSPACE.
204	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DETERMINE THE OVERARCHING LESSONS TO BE GLEANED FROM 30 YEARS OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT LITERATURE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE METHODOLOGY WAS SIMPLE: REVIEW THE PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE GENERATED DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. FINDINGS - DESPITE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING FROM BUREAUCRATIC MOTIVATION, PUBLIC BUDGETING PROCESSES, THE PROMISES AND PITFALLS OF CONTRACTING OUT AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BE AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC MANAGER, TO THE SCIENTIFIC ARCANA OF SUSTAINABILITY AND THE RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS, THE PROFESSION WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM MORE SUSTAINED EMPHASIS UPON THE HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHOICES MADE BY THOSE WHO FRAMED AMERICA'S ORIGINAL APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE LACK OF A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF AMERICA'S LEGAL CULTURE, OR EVEN A COMMON VOCABULARY FOR EXPLORING OUR DIFFERENCES POSES IMMENSE CHALLENGES TO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS, WHOSE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIRES A WIDELY SHARED, IF NECESSARILY SUPERFICIAL, AGREEMENT ON THE PURPOSES OF AMERICA'S GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS AND AN ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THE BASES OF GOVERNMENT LEGITIMACY. IN THE PAST 30 YEARS, HOWEVER, LITERATURE THAT ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWER AND DISCRETION, HAS BEEN ALL TOO RARE. LET US HOPE THAT THE NEXT 30 YEARS CORRECTS THAT DEFICIENCY.
205	THE 2010 ELECTION IN HUNGARY RESULTED IN THE VICTORY OF FIDESZ, A CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHICH ACQUIRED A COMFORTABLE MAJORITY IN THE PARLIAMENT AND USED IT TO INITIATE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT POLICY REFORMS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO THINK THAT BOTH THE WAY THESE REFORMS WERE ADOPTED AND THEIR CONTENT VIOLATED A NUMBER OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS NORMS, SUCH AS PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING AND EVEN SOME ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO DAVID BEETHAM, TOM TYLER AND OTHERS, LEGITIMACY IS DEPENDENT ON MORAL EVALUATIONS CONCERNING THE RULING POWER, AND AMONG THOSE EVALUATIONS, PERCEPTIONS OF THE PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BEING EXERCISED BY THE AUTHORITIES ARE OF A CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE. IF THE THEORY HOLDS, THEN THE LEGITIMACY OF FIDESZ'S RULE WOULD HAVE ERODED OVER THE YEARS, AND INDEED THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED, BY 2012 TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT AND IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS HAS DROPPED TO THE LEVELS SEEN BEFORE THE 2010 ELECTIONS. BUT SINCE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS HAVE PERSISTED, WE CANNOT SAY WHETHER THIS DROP WAS CAUSED BY DISCONTENT WITH GOVERNMENTAL PERFORMANCE OR PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS OR BOTH. OUR RESEARCH AIMS AT INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS IN THE FORMATION OF LEGITIMACY BELIEFS. OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS SUGGEST THAT MORAL EVALUATIONS AND, MORE PARTICULARLY, PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS EXPECTATIONS DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S LEGITIMACY BELIEVES IN THE HUNGARIAN CONTEXT AS WELL.
206	HUME IS NORMALLY--AND IN MY VIEW, CORRECTLY--TAKEN TO BE A LEGAL CONVENTIONALIST. HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF HUME'S CONVENTIONALISM HAS NOT BEEN WELL UNDERSTOOD. SCHOLARS HAVE OFTEN INTERPRETED DAVID HUME AS BEING LARGELY INDIFFERENT TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE LAWS, SO LONG AS THEY ACCOMPLISH THEIR BASIC TASK OF PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PROPERTY. I ARGUE THAT THIS IS NOT CORRECT. HUME THINKS CERTAIN SYSTEMS OF LAW WILL ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE, OF COORDINATING PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOUR FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL, BETTER THAN OTHERS. HE INTRODUCES TWO CONCEPTS, WHICH I CALL GENERALITY AND CONVENIENCE, TO DESIGNATE THOSE FEATURES OF THE LAW THAT ALLOW IT TO BEST ACCOMPLISH ITS PURPOSE. OF THE TWO, GENERALITY IS THE MORE IMPORTANT. THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM OF WHAT HUME CALLS 'GENERAL LAWS' IS A FEATURE COMMON TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS HE CONSIDERS 'CIVILIZED' RATHER THAN 'BARBAROUS'. A SET OF MORE SPECIFIC CRITERIA MAY BE EXTRACTED FROM HUME'S TEXTS, WHICH LAWS MUST MEET IF THEY ARE TO BE CONSIDERED GENERAL. MANY OF THE CRITERIA HUME IDENTIFIES LATER BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH THEORISTS OF THE SO-CALLED 'RULE OF LAW'. HUME'S CONVENTIONALISM CAN THUS BE READ AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT BEYOND THAT OF HOBBES, ONE THAT LAYS A FOUNDATION UPON WHICH LATER THEORISTS SUCH A A.V. DICEY ARE ABLE TO BUILD.
207	THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S REPORTS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN SPAIN HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS THAT AFFECT THE COMPOSITION OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIAL POWER (CGPJ) AND REITERATE THE NEED FOR SPAIN TO REFORM THE PROCESS OF APPOINTING THE JUDGE MEMBERS OF THAT COUNCIL, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS ON THE MATTER. THIS CONTRIBUTION ANALYSES WHETHER SUCH RULES EXIST AND, IF SO, WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY PROVIDE FOR. TO THIS END, NOT ONLY THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE UNION BUT ALSO THAT OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IS ANALYSED. THE ONLY TEXT ON THIS ISSUE IS RECOMMENDATION CM/REC(2010)12 OF THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, WHICH ADVISES THAT JUDICIAL MEMBERS OF JUDICIAL COUNCILS SHOULD BE ELECTED BY THEIR PEERS. ALTHOUGH THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT BINDING, NOT ONLY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, BUT ALSO THE CJEU AND THE ECTHR HAVE ASSUMED, ALBEIT WITH VARYING INTENSITY, THE NEED FOR THE STATES TO FOLLOW THIS RECOMMENDATION. MOREOVER, THE NON-COMPLIANCE WITH IT CAN INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE APPLICATION OF THE REGULATION ON CONDITIONALITY. THE FINAL PAGES OF THIS ARTICLE ARE DEDICATED TO ANALYSE THE RATIONALE FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS IN A MATTER THAT, AT FIRST SIGHT, COULD BE CONSIDERED A PURELY INTERNAL MATTER AND, THEREFORE, ONLY COMPETENCE OF THE STATES.
208	THIRTY YEARS AFTER COMMUNISM'S DEMISE, POLISH CIVIL SOCIETY IS, DECIDEDLY, SELF-SUSTAINING, AND WIDE-RANGING, WITH ACTIVISM FOCUSED ON VARIOUS ISSUES, FROM THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO EDUCATION REFORM TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THIS PAPER USES DATA FROM INTERVIEWS AND A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY TO EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION OF ACTIVISM IN POLAND AND SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIM THAT POLISH CITIZENS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN CIVIC ACTION WHEN THESE EFFORTS CONCERN EVERYDAY SOCIAL PROBLEMS, RATHER THAN ABSTRACT POLITICAL IDEALS. WE ARGUE THAT SINCE 2015, THE POLISH GOVERNMENT IS, INDEED, ATTEMPTING TO DIRECT CIVIL SOCIETY'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, THEREBY SHRINKING THE SPACE FOR ACTIVISM, ESPECIALLY FOR LIBERAL, PROGRESSIVE ORGANIZATIONS. YET, THIS IS ONLY A PART OF A MORE COMPLEX AND INTERESTING PICTURE OF ACTIVISM THAT IS ALSO SHIFTING, WITH INDIVIDUALS FOCUSING ON NEW ISSUES AND MOBILIZATION TACTICS, AND STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE CREATION OF NETWORKS, AND GROUPS THAT WORK ON DIFFERENT SECTORS BUT JOIN FORCES. THUS, ALTHOUGH SOME CITIZENS ARE MOBILIZING AROUND LOCAL, SOCIAL CONCERNS, INTANGIBLE, POLITICAL ISSUES REMAIN IMPORTANT, WITH POLES PARTICIPATING IN ACTIVITIES ONLINE AND IN PERSON TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL FREEDOM. POLISH CITIZENS ARE ALSO REGULARLY PROTESTING LIMITATIONS ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND IN SUPPORT OF GAY RIGHTS. THIRTY YEARS OF CHANGE AND DEMOCRACY IN POLAND HAVE PRODUCED A DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE CIVIL SOCIETY THAT IS, SIMULTANEOUSLY, SHRINKING, SHIFTING, AND STRENGTHENING.
209	GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE CHINESE CONCEPT OF A COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY FOR MANKIND PROVIDE DIFFERENT MASTER NARRATIVES FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. THIS STUDY ANALYSES CHINESE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND CHINESE GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS THAT RELATE TO ELEMENTS OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE VALUES AND STRUCTURES OF FUTURE INTERNATIONAL LAW ENVISAGED BY CHINA. WE ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH AUTHORS AND GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS REFUTE OR RE-INTERPRET THE UNDERLYING VALUES OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP EMBRACES THE IDEA OF A HIGHER ORDER OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS THAT DERIVE FROM THE COMMON VALUES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON JUS COGENS APPEARS TO REJECT A VERSION OF PEREMPTORY NORMS THAT EMPOWER NON-STATE ACTORS. WE FIND THAT HE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL SECURITY AND THE PRINCIPLE OF OPENNESS AND INCLUSIVENESS THAT FORM PART OF THE COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY CONCEPT EXTEND TO INTERNATIONAL LAW THE IMPORTANT REGIME-SPECIFIC DOMESTIC DOCTRINES OF SOCIAL STABILITY AND NATIONAL CONDITIONS. IN THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF THE COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY CONCEPT, THIS STUDY FINDS EVIDENCE OF A DIALECTICAL PROCESS OF NORM-MAKING THAT CONSISTS OF BOTH A CONFIRMATION OF THE NORMATIVE STATUS QUO AND THE PURSUIT OF FAR-REACHING CHANGES TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER.
210	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS), AUDTING AND LEGAL ENFORCEMENT ON TAX EVASION FOR A GROUP OF 37 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2008-2017. THESE COUNTRIES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REGROUPED INTO SUBSAMPLES OF FOUR CLUSTERS. THREE-STAGE LEAST SQUARE REGRESSION WAS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IFRS AND TAX EVASION IN SOME CLUSTERS (I.E., EARLY IFRS ADOPTERS AND STRONG LEGAL ENFORCERS). THE OTHER CLUSTERS (LATE IFRS ADOPTERS AND WEAK LEGAL ENFORCERS) HAVE A SIMILAR SIGN OF COEFFICIENT THOUGH STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. MOREOVER, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ADOPTION AND APPLICATION OF IFRS LEAD TO IMPROVED FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY AND LESSEN TAX EVASION IN SOME AFRICAN JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, LEGAL ENFORCEMENT IS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO TAX EVASION IN TWO CLUSTERS (I.E., EARLY IFRS ADOPTERS AND STRONG LEGAL ENFORCERS). SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE SLOW OR INEFFECTIVE IN ADOPTING AND IMPLEMENTING IFRS, WHICH BY ITSELF CANNOT IMPROVE TAX COMPLIANCE. IFRS CAN ONLY ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE WHEN THERE IS STRONG LEGAL ENFORCEMENT (E.G., CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, STRONG MONITORING, AND AUDITING TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY). MORE EVIDENTLY, IN CONTRAST TO WEAK LEGAL ENFORCERS, COUNTRIES WITH STRONG LEGAL ENFORCEMENT HAVE HIGH IFRS COMPLIANCE, WHICH CAN STRENGTHEN AUDITING AND REPORTING STANDARDS AND HENCE, IMPROVE TAX COMPLIANCE.
211	INCREASINGLY, POPULISTS AND AUTHORITARIANS HAVE DISCOVERED FOR THEMSELVES THE NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AS A PRACTICAL EXCUSE TO SIDESTEP TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS TO VINDICATE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECTS ON THE WHOLE FROM CONCERNS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER SHARED EUROPEAN VALUES. THIS HAS LED SOME SCHOLARS TO HIGHLIGHT THE "DANGERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY," BRANDISHING IT AS AN "INHERENTLY DANGEROUS CONCEPT," AND SUGGESTING THAT THE CONCEPT OUGHT TO BE ABANDONED. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE ANTI-PLURALIST CRITIQUES OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, WHILE RIGHTLY CRITICIZING THE AUTHORITARIAN APPROPRIATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, ULTIMATELY GO TOO FAR AND DRAW THE WRONG CONCLUSIONS. SIMPLY DISMISSING THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY WILL NOT LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE MEANINGS IMPARTED THROUGH IT. THE AUTHORITARIAN AND POPULIST APPROPRIATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY MUST BE IDENTIFIED AND UNDERSTOOD AS ABUSES OF THE CONCEPT. BY ELIDING CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY WITH ITS ABUSE, THE ANTI-PLURALIST CRITIQUE SACRIFICES A MORE INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE REALITIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY ABUSE TO A LIKELY UNATTAINABLE NORMATIVE VISION OF UNCONTESTED EU LAW PRIMACY. IN ADVANCING THIS CRITIQUE, I WILL FURTHER OUTLINE THREE POTENTIAL AVENUES FOR UNDERSTANDING CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY ABUSE, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN ITS SUBSTANTIVE, GENERATIVE, AND RELATIONAL ASPECTS. CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY CLAIMS CAN BE ABUSIVE BY VIRTUE OF THEIR SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT, HOW THEY HAVE COME ABOUT, AS WELL AS HOW THEY ARE ADVANCED.
212	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PATTERNS OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP IN EUROPE, USING A UNIQUE DATASET ON THE NATIONALITY OF 28.7 MILLION SHAREHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REGISTERED IN 41 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. BY MEANS OF AN EXPLORATORY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, IT TESTS WHETHER OWNERSHIP LINKS BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ARE DRIVEN EXCLUSIVELY BY SOCIAL AND MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES - SUCH AS TRADE OR GEOGRAPHICAL OR CULTURAL PROXIMITY - OR ARE ALSO RELATED TO MEASURES OF FINANCIAL SECRECY, CORRUPTION AND LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATIONS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN LICIT ECONOMIC INCENTIVES EXPLAIN THE INTERNATIONAL OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF EUROPEAN COMPANIES. EUROPEAN FIRMS HAVE AN ABNORMAL NUMBER (THAT IS, ABOVE THE PREDICTED VALUE) OF OWNERS FROM TAX HAVENS AND COUNTRIES WITH POOR FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, WHICH MAY SUGGEST THE USE OF HOLDING COMPANIES FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND TAX EVASION AND TO CONCEAL ILLICIT FINANCIAL FLOWS. HOWEVER, CETERIS PARIBUS, THE NUMBER OF OWNERS IS ABNORMAL IN COUNTRIES WHERE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE MORE EFFECTIVE, SUGGESTING THAT A HIGH LEVEL OF CORRUPTION MAY BE A COST IN MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES. THE FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON ILLICIT FINANCIAL FLOWS - AS FRAMED BY UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16.4 - AND CAN BE USED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES AND PRIVATE ACTORS TO DETECT ANOMALIES IN BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND PREVENT POTENTIAL FINANCIAL CRIME SCHEMES AT CORPORATE LEVEL.
213	THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY SPAIN AND ROMANIA FOR THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL COURT AGAINST TERRORISM IS A TRADITIONAL LEGAL RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS OF OUR TIME. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY, SEVERAL PROJECTS HAVE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF INCLUDING THE CRIME OF TERRORISM IN AN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTION WITH GENERAL SCOPE, EITHER AS AN EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE OR AS A PART OF A WIDER LIST OF CRIMES. HOWEVER, CERTAIN LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES HAVE BLOCKED THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS FIELD. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE MAIN ELEMENTS AND PROBLEMS OF THIS NEW PROPOSAL IN ORDER TO DETERMINE ITS VIABILITY TO EVOLVE FROM LEGE FERENDA TO LEGE DATA. THE DEBATE REVOLVES AROUND THE DEFINITION AND NATURE OF THE CRIME OF TERRORISM, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER TRIBUNALS, THE LEGAL FOUNDATION AND THE WELL-KNOWN POLITICAL IMPASSE ABOUT STATE TERRORISM AND NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS. THE STUDY OF THESE ELEMENTS SHOWS THE AIM TO REACH A CONSENSUS AT THE EXPENSE OF EFFECTIVENESS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS GOAL IS HINDERED BY CERTAIN ASPECTS, BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THIS PROPOSAL, RAISING SERIOUS DOUBTS OVER THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT. REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, THIS INITIATIVE IS A RESPONSE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST A THREAT THAT IS DISRUPTING CERTAIN BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR THE PACIFIC COEXISTENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, AS SUCH, IT DESERVES THOROUGH CONSIDERATION.
214	THIS INQUIRY EXAMINES VARIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTIONS OF IDENTITY AND THE CLASH BETWEEN DIFFERENT IDENTITY NARRATIVES IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHOW HOW THE EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHICAL IDEA OF IDENTITY WAS DEVELOPED. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE EMERGENCE OF EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHICAL IDENTITY NARRATIVES, WHICH HAVE SHAPED THE IDEAS OF JUSTICE, TRUTH AND COMMUNITY IN EUROPE. IT STUDIES THE FOUNDATIONAL IDENTITY NARRATIVES THAT UNDERLIE THE CONTESTED IDEA OF A SHARED EUROPEAN HERITAGE IN LAW AND CULTURE, SUCH AS THE IDEAS OF EQUALITY, TOLERANCE, RULE OF LAW, PLURALISM AND THE REJECTION OF TOTALITARIANISM, AND THEIR RELEVANCE FOR CURRENT DEBATES ON PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS OF SELF AND IDENTITY. IDENTITY IS AN OPEN PROCESS. IT IS A DYNAMIC HERMENEUTIC CATEGORY, WHICH IS CONSTANTLY REINTERPRETED AND REINVENTED. THERE ARE VARIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITIONS OF COGITO - SOME OF THEM PERCEIVE IT AS FOUNDATION OF ALL KNOWLEDGE AND SOME OF THEM PERCEIVE IT AS A MERE ILLUSION. IN ALL THESE PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES, THE SELF IS UNDERSTOOD ONLY THROUGH INTERPRETATION. THE SELF IS CONSTITUTED AS A NARRATIVE, AS A TEXT. UNDERSTANDING ONESELF MEANS UNDERSTANDING ONESELF IN FRONT OF A TEXT. THE SELF IS REINTERPRETED ALL OVER AGAIN ONLY IN LIGHT OF NARRATIVES PROVIDED BY CULTURE. THE TASK OF HERMENEUTICS IS NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDING OF A SUBJECT, BUT ALSO RETHINKING THE SUBJECT.
215	CORRUPTION IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, AND NOT ONLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IT IMPEDES ECONOMIC GROWTH, WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW AND UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN STUDIED AT NATIONAL LEVEL FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, THERE IS A RECENT GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH ON LOCAL CORRUPTION. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THESE LATTER STUDIES FOCUSED ON CORRUPTION AND ITS EFFECTS ON VOTES. HOWEVER, A FURTHER QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHETHER THERE IS A MIMETIC EFFECT ON NEIGHBOURING MUNICIPALITIES? WE EMPLOY DATA FROM SPAIN, AND THE BOOM IN LOCAL CORRUPTION IN THE 2000S, TO RESPOND TO THIS QUESTION. SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED A PANEL DATABASE (2001-2010) ON LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS, ECONOMIC FACTORS AND CORRUPTION AT LOCAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS. OUR SPATIAL ECONOMETRICS METHODOLOGY SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CORRUPTION IS NOT LOCAL-SPECIFIC, AND LEADS TO TWO OPPOSING OUTCOMES: ON THE ONE HAND, LOCAL CORRUPTION IS CONTAGIOUS AND THE PROBABILITY OF BEING 'INFECTED' INCREASES BY 3.1% FOR EACH CORRUPT NEIGHBOURING MUNICIPALITY; ON THE OTHER HAND THE LIKELIHOOD OF A MUNICIPALITY BEING TAKEN TO COURT INCREASES BY 6.7% FOR EACH NEIGHBOURING MUNICIPALITY ACCUSED. ALTHOUGH THE FORMER IS ALARMING, THE LATTER PROVIDES HOPE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST LOCAL CORRUPTION. (C) 2017 THE SOCIETY FOR POLICY MODELING. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
216	PURPOSE - HONG KONG IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN AGING POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE ULTRALOW FERTILITY RATES AND LONG LIFE EXPECTANCY OF ITS POPULATION. A PROMISING SOLUTION TO REMEDY THIS AGE IMBALANCE IS TO RECRUIT YOUNG PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE HONG KONG. THE INFLOW OF TYPE II BABIES (I.E. BABIES BORN OF MAINLAND CHINESE WOMEN WHOSE SPOUSES ARE NOT HONG KONG CITIZENS) HAS CREATED AN ABUNDANCE OF THEM WITHIN THE YOUNG POPULATION. THE PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THESE CONTROVERSIES HAVE BEEN EVALUATED BEING MINDFUL OF THE OPERATION OF A FREE ECONOMY IN HONG KONG AND THE RELEVANCE OF UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW (WONG, 2012). FINDINGS - WONG'S (2012) RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENDOW THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT WITH THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE APPLICATIONS FROM A ONE-WAY PERMIT SYSTEM AND TO SEPARATE THE RIGHT OF RESIDENCY OF TYPE II BABIES FROM THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO WELFARE SERVICES HAVE ALSO BEEN SUMMARIZED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE INFLOW OF TYPE II BABIES, HOWEVER, HAS ALSO GENERATED PUBLIC CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE INTENSIFYING COMPETITION FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITAL SERVICES BETWEEN HONG KONG RESIDENTS AND MAINLANDERS. THIS CONTROVERSY HAS GIVEN RISE TO SOME QUESTIONING OF WHETHER A REINTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IS WARRANTED TO DENY RESIDENCY TO TYPE II BABIES WHOSE PARENTS ARE NOT HONG KONG RESIDENTS (WONG, 2012).
217	CENTRAL ASIA IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI). ALTHOUGH A FIRST WAVE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENTS TARGETED CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1990S, FOLLOWED BY A SECOND ONE TO SOUTH-EAST EUROPE IN THE EARLY 2000S, FDI IS NOW MOVING EVEN FURTHER EASTWARD TOWARDS CENTRAL ASIA. THE CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE ALL RELATIVELY SMALL LANDLOCKED ECONOMIES AND NEED TO PROMOTE TRADE AND INVESTMENT WHICH ENABLE THEM TO CLOSELY INTEGRATE INTO THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE LEVEL OF INTRA-REGIONAL TRADE IN CENTRAL ASIA IS LOW AND THEIR TRADE IS CONCENTRATED IN FEW COMMODITIES AND HENCE THE POSSIBILITIES OF SETTING UP JOINT VENTURES EMERGES SO THAT INSTEAD OF EXPORTING AND IMPORTING THE SAME PRODUCT, ONE COUNTRY MAY DECIDE TO SET UP A JOINT VENTURE IN THE PARTNER COUNTRY (WITH A MORE FAVOURABLE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND COST ADVANTAGE) TO BUY BACK THE SAME IN THE HOME COUNTRY. THE TRACK RECORD OF FDI IN CENTRAL ASIA DEMONSTRATES THE URGENT NEED TO STRENGTHEN GOOD GOVERNANCE, TRANSPARENCY, STABILITY AND THE FAIR APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGION. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES OF REGIONAL INVESTMENT COOPERATION AND PROVIDE SOME OF THE MEASURES TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES AND DOUBLE TAX AVOIDANCE TREATIES AMONG THE CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES.
218	AGAINST THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE REGULATORY APPROACH TOWARDS THE EXERCISE OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON THE INTERNET IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN STATE OF UZBEKISTAN. THE MECHANISMS OF STATE CENSORSHIP OF INTERNET COMMUNICATION FOR UZBEK CITIZENS AND THE RESTRICTIONS THAT NARROW THE SCOPE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERNET ARE THE ISSUES IN FOCUS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE UZBEK GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, FAVORS REGULATION THAT UNDERMINES THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON BOTH LEGAL AND IDEOLOGICAL GROUNDS-NAMELY, BY ENFORCING THE LEGAL RULES ON INFORMATION SECURITY AND THE IDEOLOGICAL 'IDEA OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE'. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL GUARANTEES OF THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ON THE INTERNET REFLECTS UPON THE GENERAL WEAKNESS OF UZBEKISTAN'S DOMESTIC SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. THIS SYSTEM GIVES ABSOLUTE PRIORITY TO STATE INTERESTS IN LEGITIMIZING RESTRICTIONS UPON HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS INEVITABLE IN UZBEKISTAN UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT MAKES AN EFFORT TO PAY FULL RESPECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND IMPLEMENT IN PRACTICE ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW.
219	AFTER THE ACCESSION ROUND IN MAY 2004 WITH TEN NEW EU-MEMBER STATES, IT HAS BEEN OBVIOUS THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS VERY WILLING TO DEMAND DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, COMBINED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND MINORITY PROTECTION FROM POTENTIAL NEW MEMBERS. FOLLOWING THESE REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT IN THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA, THE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE RAISED "WHICH STANDARDS THE EU HAS ESTABLISHED IN DETAIL" AND "HOW THEY INFLUENCED THE ACCESSION PROCEDURE OF BULGARIA AND ROMANIA." BEARING IN MIND THAT ANOTHER ENLARGEMENT ROUND IS IN SIGHT. FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF THE MONITORING REPORTS OF THE EU COMMISSION FOR BULGARIA AND ROMANIA, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT A VERY FRAGMENTED PATTERN OF DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED DURING THE ACCESSION PROCESS: (1) ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY, E.G. THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS OR THE PROTECTION OF STATE ARBITRARINESS DO NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH THOUGHTFULNESS OR NO ATTENTION AT ALL BY THE EU. (2) AN AGGRAVATING FACT, IS THAT SEVERE DEMOCRATIC PROBLEMS THAT ARE EVEN LISTED IN THE MONITORING REPORTS DO NOT HAVE EFFECTS ON THE ACCESSION PROCESS. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE POLITICAL CRITERIA OF COPENHAGEN ARE CONSIDERED TO BE FULFILLED SINCE 1998. (3) FOR FURTHER ACCESSION PROCEDURES IT HAS TO BE MADE CLEAR THAT THE REQUIREMENTS IN REGARD TO DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE VIOLATION OF THESE STANDARDS HAVE TO BE REVISED.
220	THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW KENYA, THROUGH ITS SECURITY FORCES, RESPONDED TO SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION AL-SHABAAB ON THE TERRITORY OF KENYA ALONGSIDE HOW THOSE ATTACKS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES. THE MEASURES ARE ANALYZED FROM A LEGISLATIVE, TECHNICAL AND SECURITY POINT OF VIEW. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON A CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF P.C. SEDERBERG, COMBINED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY AND ARGUES THAT THREE SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST ATTACKS ON WESTGATE IN 2013, GARISSA IN 2015 AND DUSIT D2 IN 2019 WERE KEY FACTORS OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF COMPLEX COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES. THOSE MEASURES WERE BASED ON THE ADOPTION OF APPROPRIATE LAWS, DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MILITARY AND POLICE COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES. HOWEVER, CHANGES WERE GRADUAL, REACTIVE INSTEAD OF PROACTIVE. THE COUNTRY HAS LEARNED TO BUILD THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO COMBAT TERRORISM BUT STRUGGLED WITH CONFLICT PREVENTION AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. IT SUCCEEDED WITH A BUILD-UP OF COUNTER-TERRORISM SECURITY FORCES ABLE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY AND ON TIME. BUT, FINDING AND ELIMINATING THE CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT, THEY WERE FAR BEHIND. ALL THREE SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST ATTACKS SHOWED THE NEED FOR AN APPROPRIATE COMBINATION OF COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES. THEY CANNOT BE PUT IN USE SEPARATELY, OTHERWISE, IT CAN LEAD TO UNINTENDED RESULTS.
221	CHINA HAD PUBLISHED THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT LAW OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING LAW OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. AFTER THE " ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING LAW OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA " CAME INTO EFFECT ON JULY 1, 2004, THE APPROVAL OF PROJECT EIAS WAS EXPLICITLY INCLUDED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING MATTERS BY STATE COUNCIL OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WHICH PUT FORWARD NEW REQUIREMENTS ON HOW TO ADAPT THE EIA APPROVAL WORK TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DEPARTMENTS SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT LAW AND ITS SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, AS WELL AS THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES STIPULATED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LICENSING LAW, SUCH AS THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, OPENNESS, FAIRNESS, TRUST AND PROTECTION, SUPERVISION, ETC., SO AS TO ENSURE THAT CHINA'S EIA PERMITS ARE CARRIED OUT CORRECTLY ALONG THE TRACK OF LEGALIZATION. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE CURRENT APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT LAW SHOULD BE AMENDED, SO THAT THE ACTUAL NEEDS OF GOVERNMENTS AT ALL LEVELS CAN BE FULLY MET IN BUILDING A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, COMPREHENSIVELY ADMINISTERING ACCORDING TO LAW AND PROTECTING PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS UNDER THE NEW SITUATION.
222	MOTIVATIONTHE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) CALL FOR TRANSFORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT ROOTED IN INTERNATIONAL NORMS, SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, AND GENDER EQUALITY. OFTEN, HOWEVER, NATION-STATES DO NOT IMPLEMENT THESE NORMS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE ENVISAGED. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, REGIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO FILL THIS IMPLEMENTATION VACUUM. PURPOSEWITHOUT A NORMATIVE DIMENSION, TRANSFORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT RISKS REPRODUCING TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE WE FOCUS ON NORM IMPLEMENTATION IN DIFFERENT WORLD REGIONS THROUGH THE LENS OF NORMATIVE COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT. METHODS AND APPROACHTHE ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ALL USE QUALITATIVE METHODS, SUCH AS TEXT ANALYSIS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CONTEXTS, EACH ARTICLE HAS ITS OWN APPROACH TO NORMATIVE COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT DEPENDING ON THE REGIONAL NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK. FINDINGSTHIS SPECIAL ISSUE INDICATES THAT REGIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT INTERLOCUTOR BETWEEN THE GLOBAL, NATIONAL, AND SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL AND, AS SUCH, ARE CRUCIAL FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. THE ARTICLES SHOW, HOWEVER, THAT TO DATE NORMATIVE COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED DUE TO OVERRIDING PRIORITIES AND TECHNICAL APPROACHES TO POLICY COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT. POLICY IMPLICATIONSWITH THIS SPECIAL ISSUE WE AIM TO DRAW MORE ATTENTION TO THE TOPIC OF NORMATIVE COHERENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND SHOW THAT POLICIES NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE NORMATIVE DIMENSION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
223	THERE IS BEYOND ANY DOUBT THAT LATIN AMERICA IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EMERGING MARKETS IN THE WORLD, WHICH HAS INCREASED ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE LAST DECADES. IN EFFECT, THE ISSUES OF GREEN, SOCIAL, AND SUSTAINABILITY (GSS) BONDS ARE GAINING MORE AND MORE IMPORTANCE IN THE LATIN AMERICAN AND THE CARIBBEAN (LAC) FINANCIAL MARKETS. THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON RAISING FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVING SEVERAL OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, POLLUTION PREVENTION, SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FISHERY AND FORESTRY, ETC. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE A LITERATURE REVISION OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE ISSUANCE OF GSS BONDS IN THE LAC REGION AND TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH ISSUE THIS TYPE OF BOND. WE WILL APPLY MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION TO RELATE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF SOME COUNTRIES OF THE LAC REGION WITH THE VARIABLES PROPOSED BY THE IFC EMERGING MARKET GREEN BONDS REPORT (2019). IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE LAC REGION THAT ARE ISSUING GSS BONDS IS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO THE SOVEREIGN GREEN ISSUANCE (TOTAL PLANNED), THE RATIO OF PRIVATE CREDIT/GDP, AND THE RULE OF LAW INDEX. HOWEVER, THIS RESEARCH HAS HAD THE LIMITATION OF THE SCARCITY OF AVAILABLE DATA IN THE LAC MARKETS.
224	CENTRAL BANKS ARE INCREASINGLY CALLED UPON TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. PROPOSALS FOR CENTRAL BANK ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE RANGE FROM PROGRAMS OF "GREEN" QUANTITATIVE EASING TO INCREASES IN RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MEANT TO DETER BANKS FROM LENDING TO CLIMATE-UNFRIENDLY BUSINESS. POLITICIANS AND ACADEMICS ALIKE HAVE URGED CLIMATE RISK AS BOTH MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY RISK. RELATIVE TO COUNTERPARTS ABROAD, THE U.S. CENTRAL BANK-THE FEDERAL RESERVE-HAS BEEN MORE MEASURED IN ITS RESPONSE. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A LEGAL EXPLANATION WHY. IT URGES THAT, DESPITE THE SUBSTANTIVE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE PRESENTLY HAS RELATIVELY LIMITED LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM HEAD-ON. DRAWING ON INSIGHTS FROM CORPORATE FINANCE AND MACROECONOMICS, THE ARTICLE CONSTRUCTS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK-STITCHING TOGETHER A VARIETY OF FED LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND PRECEDENTS OF PRACTICE-TO DISCERN WHY MANY ASPECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SIT OUTSIDE THE FED'S LEGAL REMIT TODAY. ULTIMATELY, THE ARTICLE TACKLES ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING RULE-OF-LAW QUESTIONS FACING THE FED TODAY: WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF THE FED'S MANDATES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW FAR CAN THE FED PRESS BEYOND THOSE MANDATES TO MAKE THE ECONOMY GREENER? IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE PROMPTS REFLECTION ON THE IDEAL ROLE OF THE FED VIS-A-VIS THE FISCAL AUTHORITY OF THE TREASURY, THE POLITICAL ACTORS IN CONGRESS, AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE.
225	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ADJUDICATION AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LEGITIMACY AND EFFICIENCY OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW. PUBLIC ADJUDICATION COMES AT A SIGNIFICANT COST FOR THE TAXPAYERS BUT HELPS SECURE A CONSISTENT BODY OF CASE LAW, PROMOTES PUBLIC POLICY GOALS, AND ALLOWS THIRD PARTIES TO KNOW THE RULES OF CONDUCT IN ADVANCE TO PREVENT UNDESIRABLE ACTIVITIES. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT PROCEDURAL RULES OF THESE INSTITUTIONS (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PROCEDURE IS CALLED ADJUDICATION OR ARBITRATION) DIFFER WHEN IT COMES TO THE APPOINTMENT OF ADJUDICATORS, THEIR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND, AND HOW LONG THEY SERVE. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS CONSISTENTLY FOLLOW DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS, THE APPLICATION OF PRIMARILY SUBSTANTIVE RULES OR PRINCIPLES TO RESOLVE DISAGREEMENTS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH DECISIONS CAN BE REVIEWED INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY. BY EXAMINING THE PROCEDURAL RULES AND PRACTICES OF SELECTED INSTITUTIONS, THE ARTICLE ASSERTS THREE MAIN CLAIMS. FIRST, THE CHOICE OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ADJUDICATION IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO DIFFERENT PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES, INCLUDING THE COST OF THE PROCESS AND THE DURATION. SECOND, THE LEGITIMACY OF ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION SYSTEM MUST REST ON BOTH PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS, WHILE IN REALITY THESE TWO ARE OFTEN VIEWED IN ISOLATION. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW INSTITUTIONS COULD LEARN FROM EACH OTHER TO BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND STRENGTHEN THEIR LEGITIMACY.
226	BACKGROUND. FREE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AS A PUBLIC RIGHT HAS BECOME A CRITICAL ISSUE IN HEALTHCARE. SOME HEALTH SYSTEMS DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT HOSPITALS' PERFORMANCE TO INFLUENCE PATIENTS' CHOICES. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE TRANSPARENCY IN IRAN. OBJECTIVES. AS A BASIC STEP TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF HOSPITALS' PERFORMANCE IN IRAN, THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXPLORE THE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO TRANSPARENCY. MATERIAL AND METHODS. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH EIGHTEEN FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS WITH MACRO-, MESO- AND MICRO-LEVEL EXPERTS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM WITH DIFFERENT ACADEMIC ORIENTATIONS. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED USING A THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHOD. RESULTS. FIVE MAIN THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING INADEQUATE REGULAR HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE DATA AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT; LACK OF TRANSPARENCY CULTURE AMONG HEALTH SYSTEM AUTHORITIES; CONCERNS ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY OF HOSPITALS' POOR PERFORMANCE; ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW AND IMMATURITY OF THE COUNTRY'S HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE, WHICH WEAKENS DEMOCRACY. THEREFORE, THE DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM MOSTLY SUPPORTS SPECIAL GROUPS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC. CONCLUSIONS. THESE BARRIERS HAVE BECOME MORE PROMINENT DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONFLICT OF INTERESTS AMONG AUTHORITIES AND THE POWER OF PRESSURE GROUPS. THEREFORE, INTERVIEWEES SUGGESTED THAT THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURES BE CREATED PRIOR TO PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES IS MANAGING THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM TO HAVE DECISIONS FAVOR PUBLIC INTERESTS.
227	INEFFICIENCY OR INADEQUATENESS OF WESTERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AT HOME IS NOT THE PROBLEMATIC OF THE REST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IT YET! 'MINIMAL DEMOCRACY' IS THE PROBLEMATIC OF THE RESIDENTS OF AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES. MOST OF MUSLIM MAJORITY COUNTRIES ARE UNDER AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. THEY STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THE PRIMARY AND MINIMAL STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY. THE MINIMAL DEMOCRACY IS THE NECESSARY CONDITION FOR PROVIDING MORALITY, ETHICS, JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, FREEDOM, EQUALITY AND RULE OF LAW. THE RECORD OF WESTERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY FOR THE REST IN BOTH PERIODS - COLONIALISM AND POSTCOLONIALISM - IS NOT DEFENDABLE, NEITHER IN SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABROAD NOR IN SUPPORT OF PEACE, MORALITY AND ETHICS IN THE GLOBE. COMPARING COEXISTENCE OF ISLAM AND DEMOCRACY, MUSLIM CONSERVATIVES, MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS AND ORIENTALISTS SUPPORT INCONSISTENCY OF ISLAM AND DEMOCRACY, AND MUSLIM REFORMISTS ADVOCATE THEIR CONSISTENCY. ALMOST ALL OF THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC LAW ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CONTEXT OF EARLY ISLAM AND DO NOT FIT THE MODERN CONTEXT. ACCORDING TO ETHICAL-BASED SHARI'A, DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST AVAILABLE MEANS FOR SERVING THE MORAL PURPOSES OF ISLAM. DEMOCRACY OFFERS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR PROMOTING JUSTICE, PROTECTING HUMAN DIGNITY, HUMAN FREEDOM AND EMANCIPATION. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, SHARI'A, THAT IS, ETHICAL VIRTUES, MORAL NORMS AND STANDARDS OF LIFE ARE PERMANENT, IMMUTABLE, UNCHANGEABLE AND TIMELESS. THEY ARE UNIVERSAL ASPECTS OF ISLAM. THE ETHICAL-BASED SHARI'A SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY STRONGLY.
228	WE ARGUE THAT IN THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETIES A PREFERABLE FORM OF POLICE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BOTH BE BUILT UPON AND ACTIVELY STRIVE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL AND TRANS-LOCAL CRITERIA, RATHER THAN BE BUILT UPON ON SOME LOCAL FEATURES OR IDIOSYNCRASIES. THE LOCAL GOVERNANCE OF THE POLICE APPEARS TOO SIMPLE A REMEDY FOR POLICE LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SINCE IT MIGHT PREDISPOSE THE POLICE TO UNPROFESSIONALISM AND HETEROGENEITY OF STANDARDS, MAKING IT VULNERABLE TO CO-OPTATION BY POWERFUL LOCAL INTERESTS. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES OF THE FINNISH FORM OF POLICE GOVERNANCE THAT HAS FUNCTIONED QUITE WELL, PARTLY BECAUSE POLICING IS EMBEDDED IN THE NORDIC WELFARE STATE MODEL, WHICH STRONGLY SUPPORTS CITIZENS' UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL EQUALITY. HOWEVER, THE IDEAS PUT FORWARD ARE URGENTLY NEEDED IN DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETIES, CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASING SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND MULTIPLE SOURCES OF CULTURAL IDENTITY AND BELONGINGNESS. FOR US THE CONCEPT OF SPATIAL REPRESENTATION APPEARS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT IN ALL GOVERNANCE. THE ARGUMENT RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT MODERN, DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETY CALLS FOR REPRESENTATIONS OF SPATIALITY AND BELONGINGNESS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE RATHER THAN EXCLUSIVE, UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN PARTICULAR AND TRANS-LOCAL RATHER THAN LOCAL. OUR ARGUMENTS FOR TRANS-LOCAL POLICE GOVERNANCE ARE SPECIFIED IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSAL RULE OF LAW, A UNIFORM APPROACH TO POLICING, GENERAL PROFESSIONAL POLICE COMPETENCIES AND A GENERAL PROFESSIONAL ETHOS IN POLICING.
229	THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE DEGREE OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT IMPACT OF QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC IN THAT PREVIOUS STUDIES DID NOT CONSIDER THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT; THEY FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS ON PUBLIC HEALTH, THEREFORE, DISREGARDING THE GOVERNMENTAL FACTORS. WE MEASURED THE QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT BY PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON HEATH (I.E., RATE OF SHARE OF GOVERNMENT BUDGET TO GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP)) AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT BY FIVE VARIABLES SUCH AS CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW. BASED ON NATIONAL-LEVEL PANEL DATA (THREE WAVES) THAT COVERED 148-194 COUNTRIES, WE EXAMINED HOW QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT HAS AN IMPACT ON FOUR KINDS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, I.E., INFANT MORTALITY, UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY, MATERNAL MORTALITY, AND LIFE EXPECTANCY. RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON LIFE EXPECTANCY AND A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON INFANT DEATHS. MOREOVER, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH THAN THE QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT. LASTLY, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT PLAYS A ROLE IN MODERATING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN QUANTITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PREDICTED VARIABLES.
230	PURPOSE ONE OF THE CORE OBJECTIVES OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION (WTO) IS TO MAINTAIN A PRACTICE OF LEGALITY, INCLUDING GUARANTEEING STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS INTERACT BASED ON THE WORLD TRADE NORMS. IN SEEKING TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE WTO AIMS TO UPHOLD THE TRADE RULE OF LAW BY EMPHASISING COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFIED RULES AND PROCEDURES DURING THE ACCESSION PROCESS, DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AND TRADE POLICY REVIEW. THIS STUDY AIMS TO REVIEW THESE COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES BY INVOKING THE INTERACTIONAL INTERNATIONAL LAW CONCEPT OF A COMMUNITY OF LEGAL PRACTICE. SECOND, IT BRIEFLY ILLUMINATES CHAD BOWN'S PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH AN INSTITUTE FOR ASSESSING WTO COMMITMENTS TO IMPROVE MEMBER STATES' REMIT TO DETECT, CHALLENGE AND DETER NONCOMPLIANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER IS BASED ON JUTTA BRUNNEE AND STEPHEN TOOPE'S INTERACTIONAL THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. FINDINGS THERE IS A STRONG LINK BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY AND ENFORCEMENT IN WTO LAW. THE EFFICACY OF THE WTO LAW DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON ITS ROLE IN ADJUDICATION, BUT ALSO ON FACILITATING INTERACTIONAL LEGAL PRACTICES, WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE WTO. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER OFFERS AN ORIGINAL ANALYSIS OF THE PRACTICES OF COMPLIANCE WITH WTO OBLIGATIONS AND ILLUMINATES A NEW PROPOSAL FOR IMPROVING COMPLIANCE. TO ATTRACT AND MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE, THE WTO NEEDS TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENT INTERACTIONAL LEGAL PRACTICES FOR STATES AND NON-STATE ACTORS.
231	THE PROPOSITION ADVANCED HERE IS THAT THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO IMPLEMENT R2P RESPECTING THE SYRIAN SITUATION IS ITSELF AN 'ACT OF AGGRESSION' AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE SYRIAN STATE WHICH DERIVES FROM THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE AND DOES NOT RESIDE IN THE ASSAD REGIME OR ANY PARTICULAR SYRIAN REGIME. THE FRAMING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT (R2P) AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION IN ANY PARTICULAR CONTEXT, SUCH AS SYRIA, IS TRAGICALLY MOST OFTEN REDUCED TO A SEMANTIC GAME VERSION OF ROULETTE WITH LIFE OR DEATH CONSEQUENCES, WITH THE LATTER MORE PROBABLE THE LONGER THE MEMBERS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WITH VETO POWER PLAY THE GAME AND STALL ON ACTION BY FORCE WHERE NO PEACEFUL OPTIONS CAN END THE MASS ATROCITIES. HENCE HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES MUST PLAY THE SEMANTIC GAME MORE DEFTLY IF THEY ARE TO BE POSITIONED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SAVING CIVILIAN LIVES. HERE FOLLOWS THEN A TENTATIVE, BUT PERHAPS IN SOME WAYS AUDACIOUS ATTEMPT AT JUST SUCH SEMANTIC GAMESMANSHIP IN SUPPORT OF R2P AS NOT ONLY A VIABLE PRINCIPLE; BUT ONE WHICH GOES TO THE HEART OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE INTENT AND MEANING OF THE UN CHARTER AND THE VERY CREDIBILITY OF THE UN AS A MECHANISM FOR THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.
232	OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES THERE HAS BEEN A RENEWED INTEREST IN THE ROLE OF LAW IN DEVELOPMENT. THE MAJOR PLAYER IN THE NEW LAW AND DEVELOPMENT MOVEMENT IS THE WORLD BANK WHICH PROVIDES ADVICE ON, AND FUNDING FOR, LAW REFORM PROJECTS. THE BANK'S INITIAL FORAY INTO LAW REFORM ISSUES WAS THROUGH ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMMES INTENDED TO PUSH BACK THE STATE FROM THE ECONOMY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO LIBERATE MARKETS. DESPITE THE BANK'S CLAIM THAT ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMMES ARE TECHNICAL AND APOLITICAL, THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVELIHOODS OF MANY SOCIAL GROUPS IN HE COUNTRIES IMPLEMENTING THEM. IN THE 1990S THE BANK HAS EXPANDED LENDING FOR LAW REFORM PROGRAMMES AS PART OF ITS GOOD GOVERNANCE AGENDA. IT PROMOTES A PROCEDURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPMENT. THIS VERSION EMPHASIZES FORMAL EQUALITY AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR NEO-LIBERAL CAPITALIST DEVELOPMENT. IT IS UNSUITABLE FOR OTHER STRATEGIES OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH EMPHASIZE EQUITY AND FAIRNESS. THE BANK'S LEGAL FRAMEWORK ALSO EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. THIS IS BASED ON NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC EXPLANATIONS OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN INFLUENCING INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND HUMAN CONDUCT IS NOT DIRECT AND IS COMPLEX. AS A RESULT OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, THE IMPACT OF FORMAL REFORMS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.
233	ONE OF THE ENDURING TENSIONS IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL CULTURE IS THAT BETWEEN ORDER AND LIBERTY. INDEED, MANY FEAR THAT WHEN FACED WITH THE INEVITABLE CACOPHONY OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS, MOST RUSSIANS DEMAND THE RESTORATION OF ORDER, AND BY A 'STRONG HAND' IF NEED BE. THIS LACK OF COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE IS OFTEN SEEN AS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS EMPIRICALLY THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE DESIRE FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORDER UNDERMINES SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTY. BASED ON A SURVEY OF THE RUSSIAN MASS PUBLIC CONDUCTED IN 1996, AND EMPLOYING WITHIN THE SURVEY AN EXPERIMENT ON SUPPORT FOR THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW IN RUSSIA, I DISCOVER THAT RUSSIANS ARE INDEED WILLING TO SURRENDER SOME LIBERTY FOR THE RESTORATION OF ORDER. THE PREFERENCE FOR LIBERTY REFLECTS GENERAL DEMOCRATIC ATTITUDES MORE THAN IT IS SENSITIVE TO THE PARTICULAR CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH LIBERTY IS SUSPENDED. NONETHELESS, THE CONTEXT OF THE DISPUTE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SERVES TO STIMULATE PARTICULAR ATTITUDES; FOR INSTANCE, THE INTERVENTION OF A COURT TRANSFORMS THE CONFLICT FROM A POLITICAL TO A LEGAL DISPUTE, THEREBY ACTIVATING ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, I CONCLUDE THAT IF ELITES MAINTAIN ORDERED POLITICAL COMPETITION, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MASS PUBLIC WILL MAINTAIN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA WILL PROSPER ACCORDINGLY.
234	BACKGROUNDINFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ACHIEVING HERD IMMUNITY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (COI) IN VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND POLICY-MAKING. THIS POLICY BRIEF AIMS TO PRESENT POLICY OPTIONS THAT ADDRESS COI REGARDING VACCINES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS, BASED ON GOOD GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH APPROACH.METHODSOUR STUDY USED A SCOPING REVIEW METHODOLOGY. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH, WHICH LED TO IDENTIFYING 43 ELIGIBLE ARTICLES. A QUALITATIVE APPROACH (I.E., CONTENT ANALYSIS) WAS EMPLOYED FOR DATA ANALYSIS, USING "ATLAS.TI 9" SOFTWARE. THE PRIMARY RESULTS UNDERWENT A PROCESS OF CLEANING, CATEGORISATION, AND SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION IN THREE SESSIONS WITH THE RESEARCH TEAM.RESULTSRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEINDUSTRY AND "GOVERNMENT/POLICYMAKERS" AS WELL AS "ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS/RESEARCHERS" ARE PROMINENT ORIGINS OF COI REGARDING THE VACCINE IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE PRESENT NINE POLICY OPTIONS THAT TARGET BOTH THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE ADOPTION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH APPROACH.CONCLUSIONSTHE KEY PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH, INCLUDING, "TRANSPARENCY", "THE RULE OF LAW", "EFFECTIVENESS", "EFFICIENCY", "PARTICIPATION", "CONSENSUS ORIENTATION", "EQUALITY", "RESPONSIBILITY", "RESPONSIVENESS" AND "ACCOUNTABILITY" MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN FORMULATING POLICY OPTIONS TO ADDRESS COI REGARDING THE VACCINE IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE POLICY OPTIONS OUTLINED IN THIS POLICY BRIEF SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN PRACTICAL CONTEXTS, AS THIS EVALUATION MAY UNCOVER THE NEED FOR REVISIONS.
235	SMART CITY TECHNOLOGIES CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, MAKING IT CRUCIAL TO MITIGATE THEM IN THE R&D PHASE. THIS QUALITATIVE SOCIO-LEGAL STUDY OF THE HELSINKI METROPOLITAN AREA (HMA) EXPLORES HOW PUBLIC FUNDING FOR SMART CITY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D), AND THE DATA PROTECTION BY DESIGN PRINCIPLE (DPBD) OF THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR), FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANT TECHNOLOGY. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT THE TENSION BETWEEN THE NEOLIBERAL LOGIC OF SMART CITIES AND THAT HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANCE EXTENDS FROM THE LOCAL TO THE GLOBAL LEVEL. HIGH COMPLIANCE AND LOCALISATION COSTS, ONE-SIDED INPUTS AND A PUSH FOR SCALABILITY IN SMART CITY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN FINLAND AND OTHER EU STATES MAY ATTRACT COMPANIES TO OVERLOOK HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS AND PURSUE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE EU WITH LOWER STANDARDS OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE PROPOSE POLICY MEASURES TO FACILITATE HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANT SMART CITY R&D, LOCALISATION AND PROCUREMENT, AND DISCUSS HUMAN RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE AND EXPORT CONTROL MEASURES AS MEANS TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SMART CITY TECHNOLOGY EXPORTED FROM THE EU. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO RESEARCH ON HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACHES TO SMART CITY TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND EUROPEAN INNOVATION AND EXPORT POLICY, WITH ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE ROLE OF PUBLIC R&D FUNDING AGENCIES.
236	THESE NOTES DESCRIBE THE EVOLUTION OF THE EU STRATEGY FOR THE INTEGRATION OF THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS SINCE THE TAMPERE PROGRAM IN 1999 UNTIL THE SECOND ACTION PROGRAM (2021-2027). IT HIGHLIGHTS THE EU'S ENDEAVOR TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN MIGRANTS AND EU CITIZENS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EU GENERAL ANTI-DISCRIMINATION POLICY AND, SINCE THE ENTRY OF THE LISBON TREATY INTO FORCE, OF THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CURRENT INTEGRATION STRATEGY HAS A MUCH WIDER LEGAL AND FINANCIAL BASIS THAN THE ONE DESCRIBED BY ART. 79.2 OF THE TFEU. THIS NEW INDIVIDUAL-CENTERED AND WIDE-RANGING PUBLIC APPROACH CAN NOW BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH THE NEW EUROPEAN DIGITAL AGENDA, WHOSE AIM IS ALSO TO REFRAME AND MAKE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MORE USER FRIENDLY. HOWEVER, IN THE HUMAN MOBILITY DOMAIN, THE LARGE EU ACQUIS, WHICH IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON INTERNAL SECURITY, SHOULD BE RE-BALANCED FROM A LEGISLATIVE AND OPERATIONAL POINT OF VIEW TO AVOID THE RISK OF INFRINGING ON DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES AND ESTABLISHING A MASS SURVEILLANCE FRAMEWORK, WHICH COULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE EU AS A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND A RULE OF LAW-ABIDING ORGANIZATION. WITHIN THIS VERY COMPLEX FRAMEWORK, A PROMISING DEVELOPMENT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW EUROPEAN ASYLUM AGENCY, WHICH MAY PAVE THE WAY FOR MORE CONSISTENT EU ASYLUM AND MIGRATION POLICIES.
237	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE MASTER PLAN CAN BE ABLE TO GUARANTEE THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW, WHICH HAS SUSTAINABILITY BASED ON THE PROTECTION OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS, AIMING AT AN URBAN PUBLIC POLICY THAT ENSURES THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF CITIES AND THE USE SOIL, RESPECTING SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS AND GUARANTEEING THE DIGNITY OF ITS INHABITANTS. THE MASTER PLAN GUIDES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A MORE EQUITABLE STANDARD OF URBAN LIVING, WITH EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION, SECURITY, SANITATION, URBAN MOBILITY AND DECENT HOUSING, SEEKING TO PROMOTE TO THE POPULATION AN ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED AND ORGANIZED ENVIRONMENT, SO THAT EVERYONE HAS DECENT CONDITIONS FOR SURVIVAL, CONVERTING TO THE CONCRETIZATION OF THIS SUSTAINABILITY. HOWEVER, WHAT IS OBSERVED IS THE LACK OF CONTROL OVER LAND USE AND OCCUPATION, CREATING MAJOR CHALLENGES IN THE URBANIZATION PROCESS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE MASTER PLAN AS AN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF COMBATING THESE PROBLEMS AND GUARANTEEING THE IDEAL ORGANIZATION OF CITIES, COUNTING ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION IN ITS PROCESSES OF CONSTRUCTION AND UPDATING, THROUGH THE MECHANISMS OF DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT STATED IN THE STATUTE OF THE CITY. THE RESEARCH IS CHARACTERIZED AS BEING THEORETICAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND THE METHOD OF PROCEDURE IS THE DEDUCTIVE ONE, MAKING USE OF HISTORICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL AND LEGAL MATERIAL, FROM BOOKS AND SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES.
238	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH A SET OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE DUE COURSE OF LAW IN THE EXECUTION OF PUNISHMENTS NOT RELATED TO ISOLATION FROM SOCIETY, AND WHICH HAVE RECENTLY BECOME WIDESPREAD IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS OF THE STATE'S POLICY IN THE FIELD OF COMBATING CRIME - THE EXPANSION OF TYPES OF PUNISHMENTS ALTERNATIVE TO IMPRISONMENT. THE AUTHOR ANALYSES THE POWERS OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AS A GUARANTOR OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE 'FIELD OF PROSECUTORIAL SUPERVISION, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS, ON THE ONE HAND, TO IDENTIFY, SUPPRESS AND PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW IN THE EXECUTION OF CRIMINAL SENTENCES AND PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE OF CRIMES, AND ON THE OTHER, TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF CONVICTS. THE ARTICLE COVERS THE PROBLEMS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROSECUTOR WHEN EXERCISING SUPERVISION OVER THE OBSERVANCE OF LAWS BY CORRECTIVE SERVICES (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS CS) WREN EXECUTING SENTENCES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO ISOLATION FROM SOCIETY. THE PRACTICE OF CONDUCTED INSPECTIONS OF CS WAS ANALYSED; THE DIFFICULTIES OF IMPLEMENTING THE ORDERS OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN THE EXECUTION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS RELATED TO JOB QUOTAS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF CONVICTS, USING TECHNICAL MEANS OF CONTROL AND SUPERVISION APPLIED TO CONVICTS, WERE IDENTIFIED. OPTIONS FOR RESOLVING THE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS ARE PROPOSED.
239	MYANMAR'S TRANSITION TOWARDS A LIMITED FORM OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IS TAKING PLACE IN THE ABSENCE OF NATIONAL MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THE LEGACY OF MASSIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES: WITHOUT CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS FOR HISTORICAL CRIMES; WITHOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTIONS FOR TRUTH-TELLING; WITHOUT REPARATIONS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ETHNIC MINORITIES DURING THE EARLY PERIOD OF MYANMAR'S DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CLAIM THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETER FUTURE ATROCITIES. FIRST, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY THE MILITARY, THE DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION, WESTERN STATES, AND THE UNITED NATIONS (UN), ALL ACCEPTED THAT MYANMAR'S DEMOCRATISATION SHOULD PROCEED WITHOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. SECOND, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW, IN THE ABSENCE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTED TO BOLSTER THE RULE OF LAW BY CONDUCTING ITS OWN INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT BY THE MILITARY AND THROUGH LOW-LEVEL PROSECUTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL MILITARY OFFICERS, AND EXPLAINS WHY THIS STRATEGY FAILED. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF RECENT EFFORTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTABILITY, SUCH AS THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL'S ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIVE MECHANISM FOR MYANMAR, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY OF DEPORTATION, AND THE CASE BOUGHT BY GAMBIA IN THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) FOR MYANMAR'S VIOLATION OF THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION.
240	SINCE PATENT DISPUTE CASES OFTEN INVOLVE INDUSTRIAL BACKGROUND AND LEGAL BACKGROUND IN TAIWAN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY, SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL TECHNOLOGY, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE, TIME TO MARKET, UNCERTAIN PATENT CLAIMS, COURT JUDGMENTS AMONG DIFFERENT TRIAL-LEVEL. BUT THE RULE OF LAW AND LITIGATION EMPHASIZE THE PROTECTION OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, WHICH MAY BE TIME-CONSUMING AND OFTEN LEADS TO DELAYED JUSTICE. ACTUALLY, SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE IS CONCERN WITH THE BENEFITS OF LENGTH TIME AND COST, PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IS CONCERN WITH THE BENEFITS OF THE TRIAL COURT, AND THEREFORE, UNDER THE CONSIDERATIONS OF DUAL JUSTICE, APPLYING FOR ARBITRATION IS SUPERIOR TO THE SENDING OF A WARNING LETTER, REQUESTING A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION, AS WELL AS FILING A LAWSUIT. IN PRACTICES OF PATENT DISPUTE SOLUTIONS, OBM ALWAYS NOT ONLY RELY ON ITS OWN STRENGTHS WITH THE LARGE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL AND PATENT TECHNIQUE, BUT ALSO TAKE PATENT MISUSE TO FORCE COMPETITORS (OEM, ODM) OUT OF THE MARKET BY PATENT LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, PATENT LAW IS OUT OF BALANCE IN LEGAL SYSTEM. BASED ON THE ABOVE, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES INDUSTRIAL BACKGROUND AND LEGAL BACKGROUND IN TAIWAN HIGH TECH INDUSTRY, AND PATENT MISUSE BY PATENT HOLDER, IN ORDER TO EXPLORE WHICH METHOD IS THE BEST OPTION UNDER PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE. AS A RESULT, THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT ARBITRATION IS THE BEST OPTION BASED ON PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE.
241	THE GAP BETWEEN THEORETICALLY PREDICTED TRADE PATTERNS AND ACTUAL TRADE SUGGESTS THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHAPES TRADE PATTERNS IS INCOMPLETE. INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS MAY BE ONE FACTOR BEHIND THIS GAP, AND RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE A GREATER OBSTACLE TO TRADE THAN TARIFFS. USING DETAILED FIRM-LEVEL DATA, WE ANALYZE HOW INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES AFFECTS EXPORTS BY SWEDISH FIRMS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WEAK INSTITUTIONS IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES MAKE EXPORTS TO THESE COUNTRIES LESS LIKELY AND THAT EXPORTS TO COUNTRIES WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RELATIVELY SHORT DURATION AND SMALL VOLUME. ANALYZING LONG-TERM TRADE FLOWS, WE IDENTIFIED A LEARNING PROCESS WHERE EXPORTERS BECOME LESS DEPENDENT ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE TARGET ECONOMY OVER TIME. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IN ADDITION TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH THAT EMPHASIZE LEARNING RELATED TO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CONTRACTING PARTNER AND RULE OF LAW, WE EXTEND THIS NOTION AND SHOW THAT THERE IS ALSO A LEARNING PROCESS WHERE FIRMS ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE GENERAL BUSINESS CLIMATE. WHEN LEARNING ABOUT THE CONTRACTUAL PARTNER AND BUSINESS INSTITUTIONS IN RECIPIENTS COUNTRIES TAKES PLACE, EXPORTS INCREASE RELATIVELY QUICKLY DURING THE FIRST 2 YEARS OF EXPORTS AND THEREAFTER LEVELS OUT. HENCE, FIRMS THAT ARE INITIALLY SENSITIVE TO WEAK INSTITUTIONS, START SMALL, AND LEARN HOW TO HANDLE FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOREIGN MARKETS.
242	WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES (MNES) PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) PROJECTS WORLDWIDE, THE LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS IN PROJECT CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT BECOME A MANIFESTED RESEARCH TOPIC IN BOTH ACADEMIA AND PRACTICE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF MNE PARTICIPATION ON THE SURVIVAL OF PPP PROJECTS. A UNIFIED THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WITH INTERNAL GOVERNANCE AND EXTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS ELABORATED, AND A DATASET OF 4,336 PROJECTS IN 121 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS DERIVED FROM THE WORLD BANK DATABASE TO EMPIRICALLY VERIFY OUR HYPOTHESES. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MNE PARTICIPATION HAS A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON PPP PROJECT SURVIVAL. ADDITIONALLY, SUCH DETRIMENTAL IMPACT IS MITIGATED BY THE TWO DIMENSIONS (REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW) AND INTENSIFIED BY TWO OTHER DIMENSIONS (POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE HOST COUNTRY. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN TWO WAYS: (1) IT IS ONE OF THE PIONEER STUDIES THAT SHED LIGHT ON THE LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF PPP PROJECTS AND ENHANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MNES' IMPACTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; AND (2) IT ENRICHES THE STREAM OF RESEARCH ON PROJECT SUCCESS/FAILURE BY LINKING MNE PARTICIPATION TO PROJECT SURVIVAL AND REVEALING THE CONTINGENCIES OF HOST COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE COMPLEX GLOBAL MARKET.
243	BY RETRACING THE FATE OF STATELESS PEOPLE OF GERMAN ORIGIN, MAINLY FORMER REICH CITIZENS, WHO SUFFERED PERSECUTION AS ENEMY ALIENS DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND IN THE 1920S, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE AMBIGUITIES OF STATELESS STATUS IN TERMS OF ENJOYMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND NATIONAL INCLUSION (AND EXCLUSION). IN PARTICULAR, THE ESSAY HIGHLIGHTS HOW STATELESSNESS WAS A RESOURCE FOR MANY STATELESS PERSONS OF GERMAN ORIGIN TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE ENTENTE COUNTRIES, MAINLY TO FREE THEIR SEIZED ASSETS. THEIR STORY WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MULTIFACETED NATURE OF STATELESSNESS IN POSTWAR EUROPE. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ISSUE OF THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR STATUS IN WESTERN EUROPE-PARTICULARLY BELGIUM, FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM-IN ORDER TO SHOW THE VARIETY OF CRITERIA THAT GUIDED THE CHOICES OF GOVERNMENTS AND COURTS. IN SEVERAL NATIONAL AND IMPERIAL CONTEXTS, THERE WAS A TENSION BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE POWERS THAT RAISED ISSUES OF SOVEREIGNTY AND RULE OF LAW IN POSTWAR DEMOCRACIES. FINALLY, THE ESSAY ANALYSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATELESS PERSONS OF GERMAN ORIGIN AND THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. ON MANY OCCASIONS, THE GERMAN STATE OFFERED ITS DIPLOMATIC AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ENABLE THOSE FORMER CITIZENS TO RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY. BY ANALYSING THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS AND THE PROVISIONS ON COMPENSATION, THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE AMBIGUITY AROUND NATIONAL AND LEGAL BELONGING TO THE GERMAN NATION.
244	WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, RELIGION, AND ECONOMIC CYCLES TO BANK STABILITY USING A SAMPLE OF 254 BANKS, INCLUDING ISLAMIC (IBS) AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS (CBS), LOCATED IN NINE COUNTRIES (QISMUT+3) THAT FOLLOW DUAL BANKING SYSTEMS. WE USE A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL AND ADOPT A STRONGER ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS LITERATURE. OUR FINDINGS REAFFIRM THE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON BANK STABILITY AS PROXIED BY A BANK'S Z-SCORE. INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES INCLUDING FINANCIAL FREEDOM, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE BANK STABILITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, OTHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES SUCH AS ECONOMIC FREEDOM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RQ, AND CORRUPTION NEGATIVELY AFFECT BANK STABILITY. OVERALL, OUR EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IBS ARE RELATIVELY LESS STABLE THAN CBS, DUE TO BANKING PRACTICES, RISKIER PRODUCTS, AND IMMATURE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT IBS OPERATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS CBS. NEW TO THIS STUDY, RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RELIGIOUS ORIENTATION HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BANK STABILITY IN OUR SAMPLE COUNTRIES WITH DUAL BANKING SYSTEMS. IMPORTANTLY, WE FIND THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR THE SHARIA-BASED LEGAL SYSTEM, HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON STABILITY FOR IBS. FURTHERMORE, CUSTOMER RELIGIOSITY MEASURED AS THE SHARE OF MUSLIM POPULATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON STABILITY FOR IBS COMPARED TO CBS EXCEPT WHEN THE MUSLIM SHARE IN POPULATION EXCEEDS 85%.
245	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSED ON ANALYZING THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS APPLIED TO NICARAGUA AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF UNIVERSITIES TO TEACH ACCOUNTING UNDER IFRS. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON IFRS WAS CARRIED OUT. THE RESULTS CONCLUDE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (IFRS FOR SMES) IS NOT MANDATORY, ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE SAME GOVERNING BODY FOR ACCOUNTING IN NICARAGUA. THAT SMALL COMPANIES HAVE A SPECIAL TAX STANDARD THAT DETERMINES THEIR TAX OBLIGATIONS AND THEY DO NOT EXPRESS ANY REQUIREMENT TO ASSUME ANY ACCOUNTING STANDARD. THAT 90% OF THE 200,000 COMPANIES IN NICARAGUA ARE SMALL COMPANIES AND THAT THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO KEEP ACCOUNTING, MUCH LESS ASSUME ANY ACCOUNTING STANDARD. BASED ON ALL THE FOREGOING, A GRADUATE OF THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE CAREER HAS AMBIGUOUS PROBABILITIES REGARDING THE TYPE OF ENTITY WHERE HE COULD DEVELOP HIS PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES, THEREFORE I CONSIDER THAT UNIVERSITIES HAVE A HIGH RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH FOCUSING ON BOTH STANDARDS (LOCAL STANDARDS AND IFRS FOR SMES), AS LONG AS THIS IS NOT DECIDED BY THE RULE OF LAW. ANOTHER ASPECT THAT WE MUST NOT LEAVE ASIDE IS THAT THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSIONAL MUST ASSUME THROUGH CONTINUOUS TRAINING THAT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT DUE TO THE DUALITY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MOMENT, THE UNIVERSITIES CANNOT TRANSMIT TO THEIR STUDENTS.
246	IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE THAT THERE IS OBJECTIVITY IN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, AGAINST WHICH THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF ARGUMENTS CAN BE DETERMINED, AND WHICH COULD ADVANCE THE UNIVERSALITY VERSUS RELATIVITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEBATE. REVISITING THE THREE SCHOOLS OF TREATY INTERPRETATION (I.E. TEXTUAL, INTENTIONAL, AND TELEOLOGICAL) AND APPLYING THE THREE ELEMENTS OF RADBRUCH'S RULE OF LAW, I DISCUSS HOW THE INTERPRETER'S JOB OF BALANCING THOSE SCHOOLS HAS LIMITED ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE. I FURTHER PROPOSE AN APPROACH TO HELP JURISTS DETECT UNJUSTIFIABLE ARGUMENTS IN TREATY INTERPRETATION, OFTEN IN THE DISGUISE OF RELATIVISM. THAT APPROACH CONSISTS OF: (A) A NON-JUSTIFIABLE ARGUMENT CONTRADICTS ALL THREE SCHOOLS OF TREATY INTERPRETATION; OR IGNORES ALL THREE; (B) A JUSTIFIABLE ARGUMENT IS SUPPORTED BY AT LEAST ONE OF THESE SCHOOLS; (C) A BETTER ARGUMENT IS A MORE BALANCED ARGUMENT, I.E. SUPPORTED BY MORE ELEMENTS OF INTERPRETATION. FINALLY, I ARGUE THAT THERE IS A DEGREE OF OBJECTIVITY IN EACH SCHOOL OF TREATY INTERPRETATION, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY SHARED INTENTION AND SPEECH ACT THEORY, AND CAN THEREFORE BE HELD TO APPLY TO THE WHOLE PROCESS OF TREATY INTERPRETATION. I ILLUSTRATE ABOVE ARGUMENTS WITH A CASE (GOLDER VS. THE UNITED KINGDOM), A DOCTRINE (INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL REGIMES' INTERPRETATION OF THE EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES RULE), AND A COUNTRY (CHINA'S RELATIVISTIC ARGUMENTS ON ARTICLE 1 OF THE CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE).
247	CRITICS CONSIDER INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (IIL) AND INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) TO BE A THREAT TO GLOBAL PUBLIC INTERESTS, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, LABOUR STANDARDS, PUBLIC HEALTH OR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND PORTRAY THEM AS ONE-SIDEDLY PROTECTING FOREIGN INVESTORS AND UNDERMINING PUBLIC POLICIES THAT ARE ADOPTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOCAL POPULATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. THEY ALSO DISMISS ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE SYSTEM AS UNFOUNDED. THE PRESENT ARTICLE SUGGESTS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE JUSTIFICATION OF IIL, ARGUING THAT, PROPERLY CONSTRUED, IIL CAN BE JUSTIFIED AS A SYSTEM THAT, ON AGGREGATE, PROMOTES GLOBAL PUBLIC INTERESTS. FIRST, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW IIL AND ISDS FORM PART OF THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY UNDER A RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK. AIMED AT SUPPORTING GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WELFARE, THIS HELPS FURTHER NOT ONLY ECONOMIC, BUT ALSO NON-ECONOMIC, GLOBAL PUBLIC INTERESTS, SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IIL AND ISDS DO NOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO THE CONFLICTS THAT CAN ARISE BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC PUBLIC INTERESTS. INSTEAD, IIL AND ISDS HAVE NUMEROUS, ALTHOUGH ADMITTEDLY IMPERFECT AND AS OF YET INSUFFICIENTLY UTILIZED, MECHANISMS AT THEIR DISPOSAL FOR ALLEVIATING ENSUING TENSIONS, THUS ALLOWING BOTH ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC GLOBAL PUBLIC INTERESTS TO BE ADVANCED AT THE SAME TIME.
248	THIS ARTICLE CONSTITUTES AN EXAMINATION ON HOW CITIZEN JOURNALISM HAS CHALLENGED ROBERT MUGABE'S AUTHORITARIAN REGIME ON ISSUES PERTAINING TO NATIONAL HEROES AND USAGES OF THE HEROES' ACRE AS CENTRAL NATIONAL IDENTITY MARKERS. UNDER MUGABE'S ZANU-PF, ZIMBABWE HAS SEEN THE PUBLIC BEING LIMITED FROM DIRECTLY PARTICIPATING IN SALIENT NATIONAL DEBATES. ZANU-PF'S CONTROL OF THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC SPHERE HAS ALSO CONSTRAINED ALTERNATIVE VIEWS FROM VENTILATING THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED COMMUNICATIVE SPACES. THE PARTY'S NARRATIVE ON HEROES, THE HEROES' ACRE AND NATIONAL IDENTITY HAS GAINED A TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED STATUS IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA. THIS HAS OBTAINED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS THE ZIMBABWE CRISIS, CHARACTERISED BY A DECLINING ECONOMY, A CONSTRICTED POLITICAL SPACE, A BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT OF A NUMBER OF ZIMBABWEANS INTO THE DIASPORA. THE ACCOMPANYING WAVE OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AND THE MUSHROOMING OF MOSTLY DIASPORA-BASED ONLINE MEDIA HAVE OPENED UP NEW VISTAS OF COMMUNICATION, ENABLING A HITHERTO 'SILENCED' COMMUNITY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS. THE CONCLUSION REACHED HERE, IS THAT CITIZEN JOURNALISM HAS NOT ONLY ENHANCED THE CULTURE OF CONVERSATION AMONG PEOPLE (AS ESPOUSED UNDER DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS) BUT HAS ALSO COVERED UP THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT EXPERIENCED IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, MEDIATED BY TRADITIONAL MEDIA, PARLIAMENT AND PAVEMENT RADIO.
249	LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN FACILITATE OR IMPEDE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. STATE LEGISLATORS, JUDGES, AND LAWYERS PLAY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ROLES IN CREATING AND INTERPRETING LAWS THAT AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AND THEIR PARTNERS TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. IN AN AGE WHEN POLITICAL UNREST, GLOBAL TRAVEL, AND EMERGING BIOLOGICAL THREATS CAN COMBINE TO CREATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC HAVOC WORLDWIDE, IT IS CRITICAL THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW DURING EMERGENCIES UNDERSTAND THE LAW AND ITS IMPLICATIONS. IN 2003, THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH CENTER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS (UP-CPHP) CREATED A PREPAREDNESS LAW AND POLICY PROGRAM TO ADVANCE LEGAL PREPAREDNESS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA AND THE NATION. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, UP-CPHP HAS PARTNERED WITH LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE COURSE OF THESE ACTIVITIES, PENNSYLVANIA JUDGES, THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF PENNSYLVANIA COURTS, UP-CPHP, AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION'S PUBLIC HEALTH LAW PROGRAM HAVE DEVELOPED A STRONG AND ENDURING COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS PUT THE PENNSYLVANIA JUDICIARY IN A BETTER POSITION TODAY TO PLAN FOR AND RESPOND TO A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAN IT HAS BEEN AT ANY OTHER POINT IN ITS HISTORY. THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION CAN READILY BE ADAPTED TO ASSIST OTHER JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR JUDICIAL SYSTEMS ARE SIMILARLY PREPARED.
250	AS AFRICAN COUNTRIES GRAPPLE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF TERMS OF TRADE OCCASIONED BY ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, THERE IS A NEED FOR A STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF TERMS OF TRADE ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN AFRICA. ALSO, AS AFRICAN COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO COMMIT TO THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN IMPROVING TERMS OF TRADE, THIS STUDY FURTHER REINFORCES THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN AFRICA. THE STUDY EMPLOYS THE TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES (2SLS) FIXED EFFECTS ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE BASED ON DATA SPANNING 2002-2021 FOR 36 SELECTED AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY PROVIDES MORE ROBUST EVIDENCE BY EMPLOYING HOUSEHOLD FINAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE AS A MEASURE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IMPROVEMENT IN THE TERMS OF TRADE STIMULATES HOUSEHOLD INCOME. SIMILARLY, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT GOVERNANCE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENHANCING HOUSEHOLD INCOME STATUS IN AFRICA. SPECIFICALLY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY POSITIVELY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE HOUSEHOLD INCOME LEVELS IN AFRICA. FURTHERMORE, GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH POSITIVELY IMPACTS HOUSEHOLD INCOME, ALBEIT THE EFFECT IS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. ON THE CONTRARY, HIGHER INFLATION RATES, EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY, AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (NET INFLOWS) HAVE A LIMITING EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME, ALTHOUGH, THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY DEPRECIATION IS GENERALLY NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SEQUEL TO THESE FINDINGS, THE STUDY CALLS FOR STRONG INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND EXPORT PROMOTION STRATEGIES IN AFRICA.
251	THIS PAPER EXAMINED THE IMPACTS OF; INVESTOR SENTIMENT, GOVERNANCE, AND UNCERTAINTY ON BANK STOCK RETURNS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) AND GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) REGION COUNTRIES. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 173 CONVENTIONAL AND ISLAMIC BANKS BASED IN THE MENA REGION AND 68 CONVENTIONAL AND ISLAMIC BANKS BASED IN THE GCC REGION FROM 2010-2020. ALSO, THIS STUDY EMPLOYED THE TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATOR. THE SELECTION OF THIS ESTIMATOR PREVENTED ENDOGENEITY ISSUES RELATED TO THE VARIABLES USED IN THIS STUDY. THIS RESEARCH FOUND THAT INDIVIDUAL SENTIMENT AND UNCERTAINTY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BANK STOCK RETURNS WHILE GOVERNANCE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BANK STOCK RETURNS. THE REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FROM THE INTERACTION OF THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS VARIABLE SHOWED A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BANK STOCK RETURNS IN THE MENA REGION, EXCEPT FOR THE INTERACTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONVENTIONAL BANKS, SHOWING A NEGATIVE EFFECT. THE GCC COUNTRIES SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES WERE INSIGNIFICANT. REGARDING THE CONTROL VARIABLES, THE LOAN RATIO AND INFLATION WERE NEGATIVE, AND BANK SIZE AND THE GDP SHOWED POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON BANK STOCK RETURNS THROUGHOUT ALL MODELS, EXCLUDING THE LOAN RATIO AND BANK SIZE IN THE GCC REGION. OVERALL, THE BANKING SECTORS OF THE MENA REGION COUNTRIES WERE SENSITIVE TO; INVESTOR SENTIMENT, UNCERTAINTY, AND COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS.
252	NOWADAYS, THE SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY MEANS OF CONCILIATION CORRELATES WITH THE RULE OF LAW, HAS FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH EXTRAJUDICIAL AND, ACCORDINGLY, LESS FORMAL INSTRUMENTS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES-MEDIATION, NEGOTIATIONS. MOREOVER, THE ADVANTAGE OF THE JUDICIAL CONCILIATION PROCEDURE LIES IN THE ABILITY TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED VALUES, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL PROVISIONS IS THE BUSINESS OF OFFICIALLY AUTHORIZED OFFICIALS, AND NOT SPECIALISTS WHO ACT PRIVATELY. THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO CONDUCT A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF APPROBATION OF CONCILIATION PROCEDURES IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS. IN THE PROCESS OF WRITING THE PAPER, SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL APPROACHES TO THE ESSENCE OF THE PROCEDURE FOR CONCILIATION IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS WERE IDENTIFIED; A COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF LEGAL REGULATION OF CONCILIATION PROCEDURES IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TERRITORY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE WAS CARRIED OUT; THE PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVING THE INVESTIGATED PROCEDURE WERE OUTLINED. IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF CONCILIATION PROCEDURES IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN THE TERRITORY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE SHOWED THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCEDURE UNDER STUDY, THE MULTIVARIANCE OF APPROACHES TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION, AND UNITY IN SUPPORTING THIS METHOD OF RESOLVING DISPUTES.
253	ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY RELIES UPON THE 'RECHTSSTAAT' PRINCIPLE, OR THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH REINFORCES THE IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY I.E., UPWARD CONTROL AND POLITICAL EQUALITY BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. THE EXISTENCE OF FAR-RIGHT POLITICS MAY SEEM IMPLAUSIBLE WITHIN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES DUE TO ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES, INCLUDING POWER CONTESTATION, INSTITUTIONAL MALPRACTICE, AND CORRUPTION. RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THE MARGINALIZATION OF A SUBDUED ECONOMIC SECTOR, LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES REQUIRE AN IN-DEPTH RESEARCH ON THE ECONOMIC POLICIES OF COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION TO ENSURE THEIR LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. SCRUTINIZING THE CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FAR-RIGHT POLITICO-ECONOMIC TRENDS REVEALS THAT A NATION'S SURVIVAL DEPENDS UPON DEMOCRATIC CHOICES RATHER THAN FASCIST BEHAVIOUR. MERELY INCREMENTAL ADVANCEMENTS IN NATIONALISTIC TRENDS, INCLUDING MONOPOLIZATION WITHIN THE ECONOMIC SECTOR, CAN IMPERIL A STATE'S DEVELOPMENT. FOR INSTANCE, INDIA IS A LARGE DEVELOPING ECONOMY WITH OPTIONS FOR EXPERIMENTATION AND INTRODUCING NEW MARKETING TRENDS, ACCORDING TO AN INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF SAFE MARKET ZONES. SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST RETAILERS, SUCH AS "BEST BUY", "WALMART" AND "AMAZON" HAVE INVESTED IN INDIA. IN THIS PAPER, INDIA'S OPERATION UNDER THE SHADOW OF MARKET CAPITALISM IS COMPARED TO THE INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH APPLIED UNDER A FAR-RIGHT POLITICAL AGENDA. THIS CASE STUDY ANALYSES A REAL-WORLD POLITICO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND PROVIDES A TRIANGULATED ARGUMENT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN THE MODERN WORLD.
254	THE INTENSE ENGAGEMENT OF POPULISTS WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM-A PHENOMENON ORIGINALLY RELATED TO EXPERIENCES IN LATIN AMERICA-IS INCREASINGLY EVIDENT IN SOME OF THE NEW EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. BUT THE POPULIST PHENOMENON IS CLEARLY NOT CONFINED TO MORE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES. POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM STANDS FOR A NUMBER OF DISTINCTIVE TENDENCIES IN CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS AND PRACTICES WHICH FREQUENTLY ARE IN TENSION WITH-AND MAY EVEN THREATEN-FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, HUMAN RIGHTS, REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE RELATION BETWEEN POPULISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IS, HOWEVER, NOT NECESSARILY ONE OF ANTI-THESIS, BUT RATHER MANIFESTS ITSELF IN DISTINCTIVE WAYS, DEPENDING ON SPECIFIC CONTEXTS AND VARIATIONS. IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE, WE ARGUE THAT POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM IS BEST ANALYZED IN A COMPARATIVE, AND HISTORICALLY AND CONTEXTUALLY ATTUNED MANNER. THE SPECIAL ISSUE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDINGS OF POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH ARE BOTH THEORETICALLY MORE ROBUST AND ABLE TO COMPARATIVELY REFLECT ON A DIVERSITY OF "REALLY EXISTING" CASES. THE VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS DISCUSS CENTRAL DIMENSIONS TO THE POPULIST PHENOMENON. THESE PERTAIN IN PARTICULAR TO: (A) THE VARIETIES OF POPULIST ENGAGEMENT WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM; (B) A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE POPULIST MINDSET; (C) THE POSITION-TAKING AND REACTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS TO POPULISM; (D) THE COMPLEX RELATION AND OVERLAP OF POPULISM WITH ILLIBERALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM; AND (E) THE CENTRAL NATURE OF CONSTITUENT POWER IN POPULIST PROJECTS.
255	SELF-DETERMINATION CAMPAIGNS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH HAVE OFTEN BEEN PURSUED THROUGH WARFARE. SINCE THE 1990S, HOWEVER, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SUCH MOVEMENTS HAVE ENDORSED LEGALISTIC MECHANISMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN'S CORE PRINCIPLE OF NONVIOLENCE. WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF UN-ALIGNED SELF-DETERMINATION MOVEMENTS FOR THEM. AS A STARTING POINT TO EXPLAIN THEIR OCCURRENCE, WE EXAMINE TWO MAJOR CASES: THE PEACEFUL SOUTHERN MOVEMENT (HIRAK) IN YEMEN AND THE MOVEMENT FOR THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF BIAFRA (MASSOB) IN CONTEMPORARY NIGERIA. OUR ANALYSIS COMBINES THEORIES ON POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES, DIFFUSION, AND FRAMING FROM SOCIAL MOVEMENT, CIVIL RESISTANCE, AND ARMED REBELLION RESEARCH. WE OBSERVE THAT SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR THE RULE OF LAW, ROLE OF THE UN, AND NORMS OF NONVIOLENT CONFLICT RESOLUTION HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. WE ARGUE THAT THIS HAS GIVEN SELF-DETERMINATION MOVEMENTS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLAIMS-MAKING: FACING REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS, THE LEADERS OF HIRAK AND MASSOB HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ALIGNED THEIR MOVEMENTS WITH THE UN BY DIFFUSING ITS CORE PRINCIPLES TO THE LOCAL STRUGGLE THROUGH RESONANT COLLECTIVE ACTION FRAMES. THEREBY, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFUSION OF NONVIOLENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR IN SELF-DETERMINATION CAMPAIGNS, AND DIRECTS ATTENTION TO THE RISE OF UN-ALIGNED SELF-DETERMINATION MOVEMENTS.
256	WHEN MEDICAL DISPUTES ARISE, IT IS PAINFUL FOR BOTH THE PATIENT/FAMILY AND THE DOCTOR IF THE RESOLUTION TAKES A PROLONGED AMOUNT OF TIME AND/OR INVOLVES HIGH COSTS. THE MAJOR OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR RESOLUTION ARE LITIGATION OR COMPLAINT TO THE MEDICAL COUNCIL. BOTH OPTIONS CAN BE LENGTHY, AND THE FORMER IS COSTLY. THE LATTER OPTION ONLY PROVIDES JUDGMENT ON PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS; IT DOES NOT LEAD TO COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES. MEDIATION AS A FORM OF ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FOR MEDICAL ISSUES HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY USED IN MANY COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS WHICH SHARE SIMILAR SYSTEMS OF MEDICAL TRAINING. A NEW SYSTEM FOR HANDLING COMPLAINTS TO THE MEDICAL COUNCIL/BOARD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NOT ONLY TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS BUT ALSO TO INTEGRATE ADR WITHIN THE SYSTEM. HONG KONG AS WELL AS OTHER COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND AUSTRALIA, IMPOSE SIMILAR MEDICAL STANDARD AND ARE ALSO ARBITRATION FRIENDLY WITH THE RULE OF LAW PROTECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THESE COUNTRIES COULD BE APPROPRIATE PLACES TO TEST OUT THE FEASIBILITY OF MEDICAL ARBITRATION. SOCIETY IS EXPECTING MORE DISPUTES IN MEDICINE WITH INCREASING EMPHASIS ON STANDARDS OF CARE THROUGH THE "PRUDENT PATIENT TEST". IT IS TIME TO CONSIDER MEDICAL ARBITRATION AS A FORM OF ADR TO RESOLVE DISPUTES MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY IN LIEU OF COURT PROCEEDINGS.
257	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS AN ENTITY IN RE-EVOLUTION IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE THE EU'S HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCACY IN EXTERNAL RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE (NPE), PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE NOTION OF THE EU BECOMING A 'NORM ENTREPRENEUR' WITH ITS REVISED HUMAN RIGHTS 'TOOLBOX'. THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS CITED AS BEING AT THE CORE OF EUROPEAN VALUES, TOGETHER WITH DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, HAVING BOTH AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FOCUS IN RIGHTS PROMOTION AND PROTECTION. THIS PAPER ENDEAVOURS TO PRESENT AN ANALYSIS OF THE EU AS NORM ENTREPRENEUR IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE. IN SO DOING, IT WILL EXAMINE THE QUESTION OF EU VISIBILITY IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROMOTION. IN ITS EXTERNAL ACTION, THE EU HAS A NUMBER OF 'TOOLS' IN ITS HUMAN RIGHTS TOOLBOX. BY APPLYING A RIGHTS INCLUSION ANALYSIS TO THE TOOL OF DIGITAL DIPLOMACY IN AN ASIAN CONTEXT, THE QUESTION OF EU AS NORM ENTREPRENEUR IS SEEN TO BE DRIVEN BY STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND PARTNERSHIPS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE EU IS AN 'INADVERTENT' NORM ENTREPRENEUR THROUGH ITS PROGRAMMATIC PURSUIT OF BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN ITS EXTERNAL ACTION RATHER THAN NORM DIFFUSION AS EXPERIENCED IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT.
258	THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES THE INTELLECTUAL ORIGINS OF THE SIBERIAN LAND SURVEY OR ZEMELEUSTROISTVO OF 1896 IN ORDER TO SITUATE THE LATE IMPERIAL POLICIES OF TERRITORIAL TRANSFORMATION IN ASIA WITHIN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PEASANT REFORMS IN EUROPEAN RUSSIA. IT SUGGESTS A CONCEPTUAL CONTINUITY BETWEEN COLONIZATION OF REMOTE REGIONS AND AGRARIAN REFORMS AT THE CENTER. IT SHOWS HOW ATTEMPTS TO SUPERIMPOSE A LEGAL AND SPATIAL ORDER ONTO THE PERIPHERIES WERE ROOTED IN VIEWS THAT HAD DEVELOPED SINCE THE TIME OF THE EMANCIPATION OF 1861. THE IDEA OF ESTABLISHING A LEGAL BOUNDARY OF LAND USE WAS RELATED TO THE ELUSIVE AND NEVER FULFILLED SEARCH FOR A COMMON IMPERIAL CITIZENSHIP. BOTH IMPLIED THE SENSE OF A TOP-DOWN CIVILIZING MISSION AND AN INCREASINGLY TRANSFORMATIVE MEANING OF LAND SURVEY. ZEMLEUSTROISTVO WAS CONCEIVED AS THE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AN ALLEGEDLY UNDEFINED, TRADITIONAL, AND BOUNDLESS SPACE. THIS APPROACH INTENSIFIED AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS OF 1881 AND FOUND ITS MOST INTELLIGENT EXPRESSION IN N.KH. BUNGE'S PLANS OF REFORM. HE CAN BE REGARDED AS THE POLITICAL MIND BEHIND THE PROJECTS OF 'MANAGED COLONIZATION' OR 'ORGANIZED RESETTLEMENT'. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, LAND NORMS AND RESETTLEMENT PROCEDURES DID NOT CONFORM TO THE LOFTY IDEAL OF A 'CERTAIN' AND 'DEFINITIVE' LEGAL ORDER UPON THE LAND. UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS OCCURRED MUST BE THE SUBJECT OF A SEPARATE ANALYSIS.
259	THE PAPER DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM OF PASSIONS IN THREE MEDIEVAL POLITICAL TEXTS: DE REGNO OF THOMAS AQUINAS, DE MONARCHIA OF DANTE ALIGHIERI AND DEFENSOR PACIS OF MARSILIUS OF PADUA. ALTHOUGH THE PROBLEM OF PASSION INTENSIVELY APPEARS ONLY IN THE POLITICAL THEORY OF THE RENAISSANCE, IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE PASSIONS HAVE A PLACE IN POLITICAL TEXTS. THOMAS AQUINAS FOCUSES THE PROBLEM ON THE TYRANT; HE SHOWS THAT THE PASSIONS OF THE TYRANNICAL GOVERNMENT MAKE IT AN REGIMEN INIUSTISSIMUM. DANTE FOCUSES THE PASSIONS ON THE EMPEROR. ACCORDING TO DANTE, THE EMPEROR IS THE JUSTEST OF MEN, SO THE PASSION IS TOTALLY ABSENT FROM HIM AND THEREFORE HIS DECISIONS (LAWS) ARE ABSOLUTELY JUST. ACCORDING TO THOMAS AND DANTE THE THEME OF PASSION SHOWS A STRONG TREND TOWARDS THE PERSONALIZATION OF PASSION IN THE RULER, OR BECAUSE THE PASSION IS PRESENT IN THE TYRANT (THOMAS), OR BECAUSE IT IS ABSENT FROM THE VIRTUOUS EMPEROR (DANTE). ON THE CONTRARY, MARSILIUS MOVES AWAY FROM THE IDENTIFICATION OF PASSIONS WITH THE RULER; HE ASSOCIATES THE PASSION WITH THE LAW. MARSILIUS MOVES TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE SUBJECT OF PASSION IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE LAW AND SHOWS THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS BETTER THAN THE RULE OF THE BEST MAN FOR THE LAW IS A GUARANTEE AGAINST THE OUTBREAK OF PASSION IN THE GOVERNMENT
260	OVER THE PAST DECADES, THE NOTION OF "INDEPENDENCE " HAS BECOME AN OBJECT OF CONTENTION IN EU POLITICS IN FIELDS RANGING FROM MONETARY POLICIES TO RULE-OF-LAW STANDARDS, TO REGULATORY AGENCIES. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A BROAD SOCIO-GENETIC APPROACH TO QUESTION THE DEEP-SEATED, CROSS-SECTORAL ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN EU POLITY AND THE NOTION OF "INDEPENDENCE. " IT EXPLAINS HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN A LABORATORY OF THE NOTION OF "INDEPENDENCE, " TRANSFORMING IT FROM A NEGATIVE INSTITUTIONAL DEVICE (INDEPENDENCE FROM) INTO A BROAD EMPOWERING TECHNOLOGY OF SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNMENT CONNECTED TO NOTIONS OF GENERAL INTEREST, PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE, AND DISCRETIONARY POWERS (INDEPENDENCE FOR). THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EMERGENCE OF THIS EUROPEAN STYLE OF INDEPENDENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JURISDICTIONAL CLAIMS AND LEGITIMIZING EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ( "THE COURT "), THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AND THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THREE MAJOR EU CONSTITUTIONAL CRISES FROM THE INAUGURAL YEARS OF THE MID-1960S TO THE CREATION OF AN UBER-INDEPENDENT EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IN THE 1990S AND THE MORE RECENT DEBATES ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND IT TRACES HOW A CONTROVERSY ON THE MEANING AND SCOPE OF INDEPENDENCE UNFOLDED IN EACH OF THESE CRITICAL JUNCTURES. THE ARTICLE IS MEANT TO SPARK A PRODUCTIVE DEBATE ABOUT EUROPE'S "INDEPENDENCE WARS " IN VIEW OF FRAMING A MORE ROBUST, YET DEMOCRATICALLY OPEN, NOTION OF INDEPENDENCE TO WHICH POLICYMAKERS (WHETHER EUROPEAN OR NATIONAL) COULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
261	PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE HOW ECONOMIC FREEDOM MEDIATES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH BY USING DATA FROM 41 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2017, THE AUTHORS INVOKE SEO AND SHIN'S (2016) SAMPLE SPLITTING APPROACH WHILE RELYING ON THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED SEO ET AL.'S (2019) COMPUTATIONALLY ROBUST BOOTSTRAP ALGORITHM TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND EVIDENCE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM THRESHOLD THAT BIFURCATES THE LINK BETWEEN FDI AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA. MORE PRECISELY, FDI DOES NOT IMPROVE OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES WHOSE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX IS BELOW THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY SPURRING GROWTH FOR AFRICAN COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIC FREEDOM ABOVE THIS THRESHOLD. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AFRICAN COUNTRIES NEED TO STRIVE TOWARDS IMPROVING THEIR LEVEL OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM THROUGH THE STRENGTHENING OF RULE OF LAW, REDUCING GOVERNMENT SIZE, PROMOTING REGULATORY EFFICIENCY AND FURTHER OPENING OF THE GOODS AND CAPITAL MARKETS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FDI AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. WHILE THE POSITIVE THEORETICAL POSTULATIONS ARE ALMOST CONCLUSIVE, EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON THE PRECISE EFFECT OF FDI REMAINS CONTENTIOUS AND FAR FROM BEING SETTLED. WHAT IS MISSING IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE IN AFRICA IS WHETHER COUNTRIES' LEVEL OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM MEDIATES HOW FDI EXPLAINS THE VARIATIONS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE AUTHORS FILL THIS RESEARCH GAP.
262	ALTHOUGH CRIMINAL INDICTMENT CONTROL SHOULD BE A MEASURE TO PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THOSE ACCUSED OF CRIMES, INSOMUCH AS IT LIMITS THE PROSECUTOR'S DISCRETION AND REQUIRES HIM OR HER TO FOCUS ON LEGALLY RELEVANT FACTS AND EVIDENCE OBTAINED LEGALLY, THIS IS NOT CARRIED OUT IN COLOMBIAN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE BECAUSE THERE IS NO LEGAL PRECEPT THAT REGULATES OR INSTITUTES IT. TO FILL THIS LEGAL GAP AND GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE PROPOSES THE CONTROL BE CARRIED OUT BY A PRESIDING JUDGE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES WHETHER THE POSTURE THE CRIMINAL CASSATION CHAMBER ADOPTED IN ITS JUDGMENT OF DECEMBER 11, 2018 COMPLIES WITH THE PREMISES OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THE OBJECTIVES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE RESPONSE THE COURT OFFERS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE LACK OF INDICTMENT CONTROL IS INSUFFICIENT, AS IF THE PRESIDING JUDGE EXERCISES THIS CONTROL, HE OR SHE WILL BE CONTAMINATED WITH THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE THAT STRUCTURES THE PROSECUTOR'S CHARGES PRIOR TO THE ORAL TRIAL AND TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE DEFENSE'S THEORY OF THE CASE. THIS VIOLATES THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE TRIAL, AS IT GIVES THE PROSECUTOR A SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT HIS OR HER ERRORS, WHICH VIOLATES THE EQUALITY OF THE PARTIES TO THE PROCESS.
263	ELECTION INTERFERENCE IS A PROBLEM IN DIGITIZED ELECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. GIVEN EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA'S DENSE SOCIAL NETWORK, ELECTORAL INTEGRITY IS A GROWING CONCERN. YET, FEW STUDIES FOCUS ON THIS REGION'S REGULATORY APPROACHES TO DATA-DRIVEN CAMPAIGNS OR DISINFORMATION THREAT. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS BY PROPOSING AN ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT DIGITAL READINESS (EMDR) INDEX TO COMPARE THE READINESS OF THE TEN ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT BODIES (EMBS) IN EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA TO RESPOND TO DIGITAL DISRUPTIONS. THE AIM IS TO TAKE STOCK OF THE NEW AND AMENDED LAWS AND PROVIDE A COMPOSITE INDEX BASED ON FOUR KEY CRITERIA, NAMELY, THE (1) TYPE OF ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT MODEL; (2) PRESENCE OF SPECIFIC OR NEW REGULATIONS GOVERNING ONLINE CAMPAIGN AND DISINFORMATION; (3) CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW; AND (4) TECHNOLOGICAL READINESS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. BASED ON AVAILABLE LEGAL STATUTES AND CROSS-COUNTRY INDICATORS, THIS STUDY FINDS THE EMBS IN SINGAPORE, SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, TAIWAN, AND THAILAND TO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF DIGITAL READINESS; MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND INDONESIA TO HAVE A MEDIUM LEVEL; AND CAMBODIA AND MYANMAR TO HAVE A LOW LEVEL. A KEY FINDING IS THAT A MULTI-PRONGED REGULATORY APPROACH THAT INVOLVES DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS OF FACT-CHECKING AND REMOVAL OF MALICIOUS CONTENT, RATHER THAN RELYING ON STATE-LED INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE ONLINE ELECTORAL GOVERNANCE.
264	IT IS A RECURRING IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THAT CONCEPTS AND DOCTRINES OF PRIVATE LAW ARE ILLUMINATIVE OF PUBLIC LAW AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. CENTRAL AMONG THESE ARE CONTRACT (ESPECIALLY) AND THE TRUST. IN THIS PAPER, I CONSIDER THE PROSPECTS OF A THIRD: ESTOPPEL. THE PUBLIC LAW CONTEXT IN WHICH ESTOPPEL IS MOST COMMONLY INVOKED IS CRIMINAL LAW, AND THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE SERVICE OF UNDERSTANDING THE DEFENSES OF ENTRAPMENT AND WHAT I CALL OFFICIALLY INDUCED MISTAKE OF LAW (OIML). MY QUESTION IS HOW WELL IT SERVES THIS ROLE - HOW WELL THE STRUCTURE OF THE SELF-DISENTITLEMENT THAT PROVIDES THE RATIONALES FOR THE DEFENCES OF ENTRAPMENT AND OIML ON THE NON-EXCULPATORY APPROACH TO EACH IS ARTICULATED ON THE MODEL OF STATE ESTOPPEL, AS I CALL IT. I WILL ARGUE THAT IT FARES WELL, AND SO THAT ESTOPPEL MERITS INCLUSION ON THE LIST OF CONCEPTS AND DOCTRINES OF PRIVATE LAW THAT ARE ILLUMINATIVE OF PUBLIC LAW AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. IN CONCLUSION I WILL ASK WHAT THE MORAL-EXPRESSIVE CONTENT OF ITS DEPLOYMENT IN THAT CONTEXT IS, AND ARGUE THAT, WHILE THE DOCTRINES OF CONTRACT AND TRUST WORK AS MEANS TO ARTICULATE CLAIMS ABOUT THE BASIS AND LIMIT OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY, THE CLAIM THAT SOME CASES OF STATE SELF-DISENTITLEMENT CAN BE MODELLED ON ESTOPPEL REPRESENTS A COMMITMENT TO SOME CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
265	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PROMOTE THE DEBATE AROUND THE PLUTOCRATIC STRATEGIES OF COMMERCIALIZATION OF ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PUBLIC GOODS FOR THE AUTONOMOUS CONSTITUTION TAN OF CITIZENS AND CULTURES, PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES, EDUCATION. BUT THE LOGIC OF PRECARIOUSNESS OF EDUCATION, IF NOT OF THE COMMODIFICATION OF EDUCATION, CHARACTERISTICS OF DESPOTIC, AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS AT THE SERVICE OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIALIZED PLUTOCRACY IMPLIES THE STRATEGY OF ANNIHILATION OF THE POWER OF CONSTITUTIVE THINKING OF SINGULARITIES COMMITTED TO HUMAN RIGHTS, TO THE DIGNITY OF LIFE. IN ITS ENTIRETY AND, ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEFENSE OF THE PUBLIC SPACE, THE COMMON GOOD, PRIMORDIAL CONDITIONS IN THE SHAPING OF SOCIETIES, AND OF A SUFFICIENTLY HUMANE AND RESPONSIBLE WORLD WITH FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT IT IS AN UNTRANSFERABLE CONDITION IN A CONTEXT OF FINANCIAL CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, CONTROLLED BY THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL PLUTOCRACY, PROMOTER OF THE CRISIS AS A DETERMINING TECHNIQUE OF THE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT, UNDER THE PREROGATIVE OF A RULE OF LAW, OPERATIONALIZED BY THE PERMANENT STATE OF EXCEPTION. THE POWER OF THOUGHT THAT HISTORICALLY FOUND ITSELF ACCEPTED AND DEVELOPED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITIES. PARTICULARLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRAZILIAN SOCIETY CONSTITUTED UNDER THE ETHOS OF SLAVERY, PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ARE CONSTITUTED AS LOCUS PAR EXCELLENCE OF CONSTITUTION OF REFLECTIONS, ANALYZES AND QUESTIONS THAT ENABLE US TO TAKE OURSELVES AS AN OBJECT, UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITS, BUT ESPECIALLY THE CIVILIZING POTENTIALITIES AT OUR DISPOSAL.
266	HOW DO THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OF DEVELOPING DEMOCRACIES INFLUENCE HOW VIOLENCE OCCURS? BUILDING ON RESEARCH SHOWING THAT 'HYBRID DEMOCRACIES' ARE MORE PRONE TO SOCIAL VIOLENCE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ELITE COMPETITION FOR POWER IN THE CONTEXT OF LIMITED INSTITUTIONAL OVERSIGHT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EXPLAINING VIOLENCE. THE FRAMEWORK HERE PRESENTS POSSIBLE MECHANISMS LINKING SUB-NATIONAL POLITICAL DYNAMICS AND RATES OF SOCIAL VIOLENCE IN POORLY INSTITUTIONALISED CONTEXTS. IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW POLITICAL COMPETITION, CONCENTRATED POLITICAL POWER, AND CONSTRAINTS ON COOPERATION CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURES WHERE VIOLENCE IS INCENTIVISED AND THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDERMINED. THIS IS EXAMINED EMPIRICALLY USING SUB-NATIONAL HOMICIDE DATA FROM OVER 5000 BRAZILIAN MUNICIPALITIES BETWEEN 1997 AND 2010. FINDINGS SUGGEST VIOLENCE IS GREATER IN CONTEXTS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE - WHERE POLITICAL ACTORS FACE CREDIBLE CHALLENGES AND HAVE A MORE TENUOUS GRIP ON POWER - AND THOSE WHERE POWER IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED - WHERE POLITICAL ACTORS HAVE HELD POWER FOR LONGER PERIODS OR FACE LIMITED CREDIBLE CHALLENGES. FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST VIOLENCE VARIES DEPENDING ON WHETHER INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT ARE LIKELY TO BE CONSTRAINED OR COOPERATIVE; AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH LITERATURES EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STRUCTURAL EXPLANATIONS OF SOCIAL VIOLENCE. IN LIGHT OF ON-GOING DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF UNDERSTANDING LINKS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, CONTENTIOUS POLITICS AND SOCIAL VIOLENCE.

267	THE IDEA OF SOFT AUTHORITARIANISM', AS A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF MANY ASIAN SOCIETIES, CAN BE DEFINED AS A POLITICAL SYSTEM IN WHICH THERE ARE MINIMAL COMPONENTS OF DEMOCRACY SUCH AS ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL PARTIES BUT, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RAPID MODERNISATION, STATE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY AND AN EMPHASIS ON EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH, BASIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE OFTEN COMPROMISED. TYPICALLY, THESE STATES GOVERN IN THE NAME OF CONSTITUTIONALISM BUT OFTEN USE THE LAW TO SUPPRESS POLITICAL ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF CITIZENS. THESE SOCIETIES HAVE OFTEN REPLACED THE RULE OF LAW WITH NEO-CONFUCIAN RULE OF VIRTUE IN WHICH THE DUTIES OF THE CITIZEN TO THE STATE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATE TOWARDS THE CITIZEN. IN THESE AUTHORITARIAN POLITIES, THE STATE CONSTRUCTS AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO DISCIPLINE THE ELECTORATE RATHER THAN TO CREATE AN INFORMED CITIZENRY, SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS LOW TRUST BETWEEN LEADERS AND ELECTORATE. THE DUTY OF THE PASSIVE CITIZEN IS MERELY TO CONSENT TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGIME; THE DUTY OF THE STATE IS TO PROVIDE SECURITY BY WEEDING OUT CITIZENS WHO ARE TROUBLESOME. WE ARGUE THAT SINGAPORE HAS, UNTIL THE RECENT ELECTION IN 2011, BEEN THE CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION OF SOFT AUTHORITARIANISM, BUT WE CONCLUDE BY ASKING WHETHER SINGAPORE IS MOVING FROM GOVERNANCE BASED ON A GARDENING METAPHOR OF WEEDING OUT BAD INFLUENCES TO A MORE MATURE AND OPEN DEMOCRACY.
268	IN RECENT YEARS SCHOLARS HAVE BEGUN TO FOCUS ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF INDIVIDUALS' EXPOSURE TO CIVIL WAR, INCLUDING ITS SEVERE HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. OUR INNOVATION IS TO MOVE BEYOND THE SURVEY METHODOLOGY THAT IS WIDESPREAD IN THIS LITERATURE TO ANALYZE THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF EXPOSURE TO CIVIL WAR IN A COMMON INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. WE EXPLOIT THE PRESENCE OF THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCCER (FOOTBALL) PLAYERS WITH DIFFERENT EXPOSURES TO CIVIL CONFLICT IN THE EUROPEAN PROFESSIONAL LEAGUES, AND FIND A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXTENT OF CIVIL CONFLICT IN A PLAYER'S HOME COUNTRY AND HIS PROPENSITY TO BEHAVE VIOLENTLY ON THE SOCCER FIELD, AS MEASURED BY YELLOW AND RED CARDS. THIS LINK IS ROBUST TO REGION FIXED EFFECTS, COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS (E.G. RULE OF LAW, PER CAPITA INCOME), PLAYER CHARACTERISTICS (E.G. AGE, FIELD POSITION, QUALITY), OUTLIERS, AND TEAM FIXED EFFECTS. REINFORCING OUR CLAIM THAT WE ISOLATE THE EFFECT OF CIVIL WAR EXPOSURE RATHER THAN SIMPLE RULE BREAKING OR SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY, THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL CORRELATION BETWEEN OUR MEASURE OF EXPOSURE TO CIVIL WAR AND SOCCER PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT CLOSELY RELATED TO VIOLENT CONDUCT. THE RESULT IS ALSO ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR CIVIL WARS BEFORE A PLAYER'S BIRTH, SUGGESTING THAT IT IS NOT DRIVEN BY FACTORS FROM THE DISTANT HISTORICAL PAST.
269	ON 1 JULY 1997, HONG KONG WAS RETURNED TO CHINA AFTER A 150-YEAR INTERLUDE AS A BRITISH COLONY. THIS TRANSITION IS NOT ONLY POLITICAL IN NATURE, IT IS ALSO A CULTURAL TRANSITION. AT PRESENT, TWO BROAD CONSTRUCTIONS OF HONG KONG CULTURAL IDENTITY VIE FOR THE ALLEGIANCE OF HONG KONG'S PEOPLE: ''HONG KONG AS A PART OF CHINA'' AND ''HONG KONG AS APART FROM CHINA.'' THESE CONSTRUCTIONS OF IDENTITY PRESENT ARE REFLECTED IN VYING CONSTRUCTIONS OF IDENTITY PAST: BRITISH-INFLUENCED HISTORIANS AND CHINESE-INFLUENCED HISTORIANS OFFER VERY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF HONG KONG'S PRECOLONIAL AND COLONIAL HISTORY IN THEIR ARGUMENTS OVER WHETHER OR NOT HONG KONG IS TRULY A ''CHINESE'' CITY. THESE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS POINT TO A LARGER FACT: BETWEEN THE COMPETING HEGEMONIES OF THE BRITISH AND CHINESE EMPIRES, HONG KONG PEOPLE HAVE ONLY LATELY BEGUN TO DEFINE THEMSELVES AS HAVING AN AUTONOMOUS CULTURAL IDENTITY. ''HONGKONGESE'' AS A CULTURAL IDENTITY INVOLVES A ''CHINESENESS PLUS'' THAT HAS THREE CLUSTERS OF MEANING: ''CHINESENESS PLUS AFFLUENCE/COSMOPOLITANISM/CAPITALISM,'' ''CHINESENESS PLUS ENGLISH/COLONIAL EDUCATIAN/COLONIALISM,'' AND ''CHINESENESS PLUS DEMOCRACY/HUMAN RIGHTS/THE RULE OF LAW.'' THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CULTURAL IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG AND ARGUES THAT THE SURVIVAL OF HEUNGGONGYAHN/HONGKONGESE AS A CULTURAL IDENTITY DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE VOICES OF DEMOCRACY WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEARD IN HONG KONG.
270	TRANSNATIONAL TORT LITIGATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAS GENERATED AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COMMENTARY. YET THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ON ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ). THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS SOME OF THOSE IMPLICATIONS THROUGH A STUDY OF A LANDMARK CASE IN WHICH 10,000 PHILIPPINE VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND OTHER ABUSES SUED FERDINAND MARCOS IN US COURTS UNDER THE ALIEN TORT STATUTE. ANALYZING MARCOS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CRITICAL APPROACHES TO TJ REVEALS THAT WHILE VICTIM GROUPS USED THE LAWSUIT IN EMPOWERING WAYS IN THE PHILIPPINES, THEIR CLAIMS ALSO CONFLICTED WITH THE STATE'S TRANSITIONAL POLICY SEEKING ECONOMIC REDISTRIBUTION. IRONICALLY, ENFORCEMENT DIFFICULTIES MEDIATED THE CONFLICT, LEADING TO THE ENACTMENT OF A LAW COMPENSATING AND RECOGNIZING A BROADER RANGE OF VICTIMS WHILE PRESERVING THE REDISTRIBUTION POLICY. THIS ANALYSIS EXPOSES SOME OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF TRANSNATIONAL TORT LITIGATION AGAINST FOREIGN STATE OFFICIALS, AND OFFERS A NOVEL PERSPECTIVE ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF TRANSNATIONAL REMEDIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
271	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ANTI-MASK PROTESTS IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY, I LOOK AT THE CULTURAL (MIS)APPROPRIATION OF SLOGANS BY ANTI-MASK PROTESTORS, SUCH AS "I CAN'T BREATHE" AND "MY BODY, MY CHOICE." NOTING THAT THIS IS AT FIRST GLANCE A BIT OF A PUZZLING PHENOMENON, I SHOW THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ANTI-MASK PROTEST, WHITE CHRISTIAN GRIEVANCE POLITICS, AND THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. DRAWING ON THE WORK OF BONNIE HONIG, I ARGUE THAT THE ANTI-MASK PROTESTS REPRESENT A MODE OF OPTING OUT OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT, HENCE OPTING OUT OF THE PRACTICE OF USING RATIONAL ARGUMENTATION TO EXPLAIN WHY THINGS OUGHT TO BE A CERTAIN WAY, AS WELL AS LISTENING TO THE REASONS OF OTHERS. INSOFAR AS THIS HAS BECOME A POPULAR MODE OF ENGAGEMENT AMONG A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF AMERICANS, IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE LANGUAGE OF FOREGOING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS IN US PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY. INDEED, FURTHER EXPLICATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESPONSIBILITY AND FREEDOM IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. I MAINTAIN THAT OPTING OUT IS ETHICALLY UNTENABLE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF INTERDEPENDENCE WITH OTHERS AND THE NECESSITY OF ADHERING TO THE RULE OF LAW. AN ETHIC OF RECIPROCITY PROPERLY GROUNDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF EMBODIED FREEDOM, RESISTING THE EXTREMES OF GRIEVANCE POLITICS.
272	THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE AIMS TO CORRECT MARKET FAILURE AND ITS RESULTING SOCIAL INJUSTICE BY SHIFTING POLLUTION COSTS FROM THE PUBLIC AT LARGE TO POLLUTING ENTERPRISES, AT THE SAME TIME REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION PRODUCED. CHINA HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE AS A KEY INSTRUMENT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL REGIME. HOWEVER, CHINA'S IMPLEMENTATION FALLS SHORT IN ONE KEY RESPECT: IT HAS NOT SOUGHT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NECESSARY PARALLEL SYSTEM OF INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY VERIFICATION OF THE MONITORING AND REPORTING PRACTICES OF POLLUTING ENTERPRISES. INSTEAD, VERIFICATION OF THE REPORTED DATA IS STILL BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, THROUGH ON-SITE INSPECTIONS BY TEAMS OF GOVERNMENT AGENTS. IN ITS EAGERNESS TO ENFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN A SOCIETY WHERE VIOLATIONS BY POLLUTERS ARE THE NORM MORE THAN THE EXCEPTION, CHINA'S GOVERNMENT IS CONTRAVENING THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE'S IMPLIED REQUIREMENT OF 'INDEPENDENCE' IN THE VERIFICATION OF POLLUTION DATA. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IN THE NAME OF FAIRNESS AND OVERALL GOOD GOVERNANCE, CHINA'S LEGISLATURE SHOULD BEGIN TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDUSTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL VERIFIERS IN THE COUNTRY'S NONGOVERNMENTAL SECTOR. SUCH A REFORM MAY SEEM AMBITIOUS JUST NOW, BUT AS THE RULE OF LAW STRENGTHENS IN CHINA, THE BASIS OF RESISTANCE TO INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY VERIFICATION SHOULD FALL AWAY.
273	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEVELOP A BACK-TO-BACK APPROACH TO THE NOTIONS OF 'SECURITY GOVERNANCE' AND 'SECURITY SECTOR REFORM'. IT DRAWS ON TWO SMALL-SCALE GRASSROOTS POLICING ARRANGEMENTS IN BURUNDI, ARGUABLY FALLING OUT-OF-SCOPE OF STATE MANAGEMENT, TO QUESTION THE NOTION OF 'WIDE SECURITY SECTOR REFORM' AS PROMOTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT AID COMMUNITY. THE USE OF INFORMAL SENTINELS, GUARDING ALMOST EVERY COMMERCIAL AND DOMESTIC BUILDINGS IN BUJUMBURA AND THE RECONVERSION OF BANDITS INTO GUARDS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, MAKE BOTH A CASE FOR CONSIDERING THE GRASSROOTS POLICING ARRANGEMENTS IN BURUNDI AS BLIND SPOTS OF SECURITY SECTOR REFORM. ACCORDINGLY, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW, IN A TRANSITIONING CONTEXT WHERE DIFFERENT AGENTS AND NORMATIVITIES - NAMELY THE GOVERNMENT, THE POLICE, CORPORATE SECURITY ACTORS, DONOR STATES AND INSTITUTIONS, INDIVIDUALS, TRANSNATIONAL NORMS ON (PRIVATE) SECURITY AND LOCAL DYNAMICS - ARE INTERTWINED IN THE PROVISION OF SECURITY, DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN DONOR DISCOURSES AND LOCAL DYNAMICS REMAIN AT WORK. WHILE RECENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF SECURITY SECTOR REFORM FORMALLY DEPART FROM STATE-CENTERED VIEWS OF SECURITY GOVERNANCE, IMPLEMENTATION ON THE GROUND STILL RESISTS HOLISTIC APPROACHES OF SECURITY. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THESE DISCREPANCIES REFLECT THE THEORETICAL DEBATE OVER THE STATE'S ROLE IN SECURITY GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY IN CONTEXTS WHERE CONCERNS ABOUT DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT, THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARISE. IN THIS SENSE, THE ARTICLE INTENDS TO CONTRIBUTE TO RECENT INSIGHTS ON CRITICAL SECURITY SECTOR REFORM AND NODAL SECURITY GOVERNANCE.
274	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES WHY A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE FINLAND, WHICH HAS EXCELLENT NATURAL ATTRIBUTES AS A PLACE FOR ARBITRATION (POLITICAL NEUTRALITY AND STABILITY, RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM FROM CORRUPTION AND A CENTRAL LOCATION BETWEEN EAST AND WEST), BUT WHICH IS LITTLE RESORTED TO FOR THIS PURPOSE, BEING OVERSHADOWED BY ITS NEIGHBOUR, SWEDEN, SHOULD ADOPT THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW ('UNCITRAL') MODEL LAW ON INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION (THE 'MODEL LAW'). THE INDISPENSABLE CONDITION FOR ANY COUNTRY TO DEVELOP AS A PLACE FOR ARBITRATION IS FOR IT TO HAVE A MODERN AND INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTABLE ARBITRATION LAW. HOWEVER, FINLAND'S ARBITRATION LAW IS RELATIVELY OLD (DATING FROM 1992) AND BASED ON AN ANTIQUATED SWEDISH MODEL. WHAT IS MORE SERIOUS IS THAT FINLAND'S LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ARBITRATION, THAT IS, ITS ARBITRATION LAW AND COURT SYSTEM, IS NOT PERCEIVED BY INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION USERS AND ARBITRAL INSTITUTIONS AS BEING INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTABLE. BY CONTRAST, THE MODEL LAW IS RECOGNIZED TODAY AS THE 'BASELINE FOR ANY STATE WISHING TO MODERNIZE ITS LAW OF ARBITRATION' ACCORDINGLY, IF FINLAND WANTS TO BECOME AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, AS IT SHOULD DO, THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS FOR IT TO ADOPT THE MODEL LAW. THIS WILL MAKE FINLAND INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE AROUND THE WORLD AS HAVING A MODERN AND INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTABLE ARBITRATION LAW.
275	THIS STUDY TRACES HOW IT IS APPLIED THE RULE OF LAW REGARDING EXPROPRIATION OF THE TWO ESTATES. THE STUDY ALSO EXPLAINS HOW THE PARTS OF THE TWO EXPROPRIATED ESTATES ARE DIVIDED TO THE RESIDENTS OF SCORTARU NOU VILLAGE, BRAILA COUNTY. IN SCORTARU NOU VILLAGE, BRAILA COUNTY, THERE WERE TWO ESTATES BELONGING TO GRADISTEANU FAMILY: THE DOMAIN SIHLEANU IN SURFACE OF 2,250 HA AND THE ESTATE ARICIU IN SURFACE OF 1,600 HA. THE ESTATES WERE SUBJECT, AS WELL AS ALL LARGE ESTATES IN THE COUNTRY, OF THE EXPROPRIATION LAWS THAT PRECEDED THE AGRARIAN LAWS. THEY WERE SUBJECT TO THE 1918 LAW DECREES, AGRARIAN LAW OF 1921 AND AGRARIAN LAW OF 1945. THE ESTATES BELONGED TO CLASS II BOYAR - ZAMFIR SIHLEANU. THESE ESTATES REACH IN THE WEALTH OF GRADISTEANU FAMILY, OLD BOYAR FAMILY OF ROYAL DESCENT, BY THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN ELENA SIHLEANU, DAUGHTER OF ZAMFIR SIHLEANU BOYAR WITH CONSTANTINE GRADISTEANU. LATER, THE ESTATES OF SIHLEANU AND ARICIU REACH ALSO IN THE GHICA'S FAMILY WEALTH BY THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE DAUGHTER OF CONSTANTINE GRADISTEANU AND ELENA SIHLEANU, MARY, WITH SCARLAT GHICA. IN 1919, WHEN THE ESTATES ARE SUBJECT TO EXPROPRIATION, THE HEIRS OF THIS BEAUTIFUL FORTUNE ARE JOHN C. GRADISTEANU, SERBAN GHICA AND MARY STEFANESCU. LATER, IN 1945, THE HEIRS ARE ELENA A. BOGDAN AND MICHAEL GRADISTEANU.
276	IN 2004, THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL PUBLISHED THE REPORT OF THE HIGH-LEVEL PANEL OF EXPERTS ON THREATS, CHALLENGES AND CHANGE THAT PROJECTED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO FIGHT VARIOUS TYPES OF SCOURGES THAT AFFLICT HUMANKIND AND NOTABLY TERRORISM. THE REPORT AND THE FOLLOWING WORLD SUMMIT DOCUMENTS INSCRIBE THEMSELVES IN ESTABLISHED TRENDS SET BY THE STATE COMMUNITY AND THE UNITED NATIONS IN THE PAST DECADES. SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER, FIVE DIFFERENT WIDE-ENCOMPASSING STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO THE STATE COMMUNITY TO COME TO TERMS WITH TERRORISM. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THIS PROLIFERATION OF DOCUMENTS AND THEIR INCONSISTENCY IN TERMS OF CONTENT. YET, IT ALSO PINPOINTS THE COMMON THREAD THAT RUNS THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS, NAMELY THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY MUST ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF TERRORISM, STRENGTHEN STATES AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, THREE TARGETS THAT CAN BE REACHED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STRONG POLICY OF CAPACITY-BUILDING. IN ALL CASES, THE STATE COMMUNITY WORKS ON THE PREMISE THAT WEAK AND ROGUE STATES WILL CONSENT TO BE HELPED IN BUILDING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL CAPACITY TO COMBAT TERRORISM. UNDOUBTEDLY, CONVINCING WEAK AND ROGUE STATES TO ABIDE BY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN JUST CAPACITY-BUILDING TO DEFLECT TERRORISM. RATHER, THE UNITED NATIONS WILL NEED TO CONCEPTUALISE GENERAL MEASURES TO PREVENT AND REVERSE STATE FAILURE, WHICH IN TURN MEANS THAT THE STRATEGY MUST BE INDEED 'COMPREHENSIVE'.
277	BROADENING ACCESS TO FINANCE IS AMONG THE TOP PRIORITIES FOR GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS ON ACCESS TO FINANCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ACROSS 109 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2020. THE RESULTS OF DYNAMIC TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATION DEMONSTRATE THAT TOTAL NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS HINDER ACCESS TO FINANCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS, CONFIRMING THE NATURAL RESOURCE CURSE HYPOTHESIS. SPECIFICALLY, RENTS FROM OIL, COAL, MINERALS, AND FORESTS NEGATIVELY AFFECT ACCESS TO FINANCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS, WHILE GAS RENT HAS SURPRISINGLY A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BOTH. FURTHERMORE, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTES ACCESS TO FINANCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS. ALL ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) POSITIVELY AFFECT ACCESS TO FINANCE EXCEPT REGULATORY QUALITY, WHICH HAS AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ACCESS TO FINANCE IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. MOREOVER, OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATES THE EFFECT OF NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS ON ACCESS TO FINANCE, SPECIFICALLY, IT VARIES DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE INSTITUTIONS ARE STRONG OR WEAK, BEING POSITIVE IN THE FORMER CASE AND NEGATIVE IN THE LATTER. THE STUDY CONDUCTS SEVERAL ROBUSTNESS TESTS USING ADDITIONAL CONTROLS, ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF FINANCIAL ACCESS, AND SAMPLE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, ALL OF WHICH CONFIRM THE FINDINGS. FINALLY, WE SUGGEST POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS.
278	DESPITE PROSECUTORS' DIFFICULTIES IN PROVING CORPORATE BRIBERY, NEARLY ALL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS END WITH A SETTLEMENT AT THE PRETRIAL STAGE. COMPARED TO COURT PROCEEDINGS, SETTLEMENT-BASED ENFORCEMENT PROVIDE PROSECUTORS WITH FLEXIBILITY TO REWARD OFFENDERS' SELF-REPORTING AND COOPERATION, AND REACH QUICKER CONCLUSIONS TO COMPLEX CASES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLAIN, SUCH ENFORCEMENT NEEDS REGULATION TO MINIMIZE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL SIDE-EFFECTS. WHEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COURT AND SETTLEMENT SANCTION EXCEEDS A CERTAIN SIZE, THE ALLEGED OFFENDER ACCEPTS A SETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF ACTUAL RESPONSIBILITY OF MISCONDUCT. FOR THE PROSECUTOR, THE OPTION OF OFFERING A LENIENT SETTLEMENT MEANS WEAKER INCENTIVES TO ASCERTAIN THE MATERIAL FACTS OF THE CASE. SOCIETY RECEIVES LESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE BLAMEWORTHY ACT, LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE SANCTION, AND LESS REASON TO EXPECT SANCTIONS TO DETER BRIBERY. WE SHOW WHY SUCH CONSEQUENCES RESULT IN UNDER-DETERRENCE OF BRIBERY AND WEAKER RULE OF LAW. THE USE OF SETTLEMENT MAY HAVE A SELF-ESCALATING EFFECT BECAUSE THE ENFORCEMENT MODE CAN REDUCE THE PREDICTABILITY OF THE LAW, WHILE A DEFENDANT'S INCLINATION TO ACCEPT A SETTLEMENT OFFER DEPENDS ON THE PREDICTABILITY OF THE LAW. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT UNITED KINGDOM'S CURRENT ESCALATION OF ENFORCEMENT OF CORPORATE BRIBERY LAWS WILL LEAD TO A MIXTURE OF SETTLEMENTS AND COURT DECISIONS, WHILE IN THE UNITED STATES FIRMS WILL CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENTS AS IF THERE WERE NO OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR CASES TESTED IN COURT.
279	IN THE PERIOD OF 2009-2014, ORGANIZED CRIME SUBJECTED ALL KINDS OF POLITICAL AUTHORITIES AND BENEFITED FROM IMPUNITY THROUGHOUT MEXICO, ESPECIALLY IN MICHOACAN AND GUERRERO. THIS CIRCUMSTANCE PROVOKED A GRAVE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS SINCE THESE AUTHORITIES WERE MEANINGFULLY OVERRIDDEN AND WERE NOT ABLE TO PROPERLY ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW IN THESE REGIONS. THESE PHENOMENA BROUGHT ABOUT THE RISE OF SELF-DEFENSE GROUPS FROM LOCAL CIVIL SOCIETIES, AS A DESPERATE MEASURE TO PROTECT THEIR MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FROM RUTHLESS CRIME. HOWEVER, THIS UPRISING DEEPENED THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, ALREADY EXPERIENCED IN THESE REGIONS DUE TO THE CALAMITOUS ACTIVITIES OF CRIMINAL ORGANISATIONS, BECAUSE IT IMPLIED THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE MEXICAN STATE TO RESTORE LEGAL ORDER. THE PRESENT ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A FORMAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY BY THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT, WITH THE OFFICIAL APPROVAL OF THE MEXICAN CONGRESS, WOULD HAVE SOLVED EFFICIENTLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT MICHOACAN, GUERRERO AND OTHER REGIONS WERE GOING THROUGH IN THIS PERIOD, AND WOULD HAVE COMPETENTLY DISCOURAGED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO RELAY ON VIGILANTES AS THEIR LAST RESORT TO GUARANTEE THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE FACE OF ORGANIZED CRIME. THIS ARGUMENT IS BASED ON ARCHIVE RESEARCH, TESTIMONIES OF PEOPLE UPLOADED IN VIDEO DOCUMENTARIES, THE MEXICAN CONSTITUTION, THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP OF CLINTON ROSSITER, AND THE LEGAL DOCTRINE ON BALANCE AND DELIBERATION OF ROBERT ALEXY.
280	DANGEROUS LEGISLATIVE TRENDS ARE EMERGING THAT THREATEN THE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN INDIA, THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENTARIANS IS BEING DILUTED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. THE ROLE OF THE UPPER HOUSE OF INDIAN PARLIAMENT (RAJYA SABHA) IN LAW MAKING, IS DILUTED, BY INCLUSION OF NON-TAX LAWS IN THE FINANCE BILL, AND BY LABELING APPARENTLY A NON-MONEY BILL AS A MONEY BILL. IT SEEMS THAT IN ORDER TO GET ITS KEY LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS ENACTED AS LAW THE GOVERNMENT RUSHED THROUGH MANY AMENDMENTS IN NON-TAX LAWS THROUGH THE ROUTE OF FINANCE BILL. IT ALSO SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ENACTED AADHAR ACT AS A MONEY BILL THOUGH APPARENTLY AADHAR ACT FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF A FINANCIAL BILL. THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA AND PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE ALLOWS RAJYA SABHA TO EFFECTIVELY DEBATE AND VOTE ON A FINANCIAL BILL. A MONEY BILL CAN BE INTRODUCED ONLY IN THE LOK SABHA. A MONEY BILL AFTER BEING PASSED BY THE LOK SABHA IS TRANSMITTED TO THE RAJYA SABHA. IT IS THE DISCRETION OF THE LOK SABHA TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE AMENDMENTS MADE BY THE RAJYA SABHA TO A MONEY BILL. THE AADHAR ACT, 2016 COULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AS A FINANCIAL BILL AS ITS PREDECESSOR THE NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION AUTHORITY OF INDIA BILL, 2010 WAS RIGHTLY TREATED A FINANCIAL BILL.
281	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE FOCUS ON HOW A VARIETY OF ILLIBERAL DISCOURSES CONSTRUCT A SCENE FOR NEW GEOPOLITICAL AND GEOCULTURAL IMAGERIES OF THE POST-SOVIET SPACE, EUROPE, AND EURASIA. ACADEMICALLY, OUR APPROACH FALLS INTO DISCIPLINARY NICHES KNOWN AS POPULAR GEOPOLITICS (WHEN IT COMES TO TERRITORIES) AND BIOPOLITICS (WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE). MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE TRY TO SEE HOW RUSSIAN ARTISTIC PERSONALITIES AND PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS CONTRIBUTE TO THE RE-IMAGINATION OF THE POST-SOVIET SPACE ALONG THE LINES OF RUSSIAN ILLIBERAL - AND LARGELY ANTI-WESTERN - THINKING. AMONG OUR PROTAGONISTS ARE VALERY GERGIEV, IOSIF KOBZON, YULIA CHICHERINA, GLEB KORNILOV, IVAN OKHLOBYSTIN, AND ZAKHAR PRILEPIN. ALL OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT CULTURAL FIGURES WHO PRODUCE CULTURAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR IMPERIAL FOREIGN POLICY IN GENERAL, AND RUSSIA'S ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND DE FACTO OCCUPATION OF DONBAS IN PARTICULAR. OUR MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT THE ILLIBERAL IMAGERY OF THE POST-SOVIET WORLD DRASTICALLY REDUCES THE VALIDITY OF THE MAJOR PILLARS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY, SUCH AS STATE TERRITORIAL BORDERS, NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS, CITIZENSHIP, AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS. INSTEAD OF THE RULE OF LAW RUSSIAN PERFORMATIVE ILLIBERALISM PUTS A PREMIUM ON A SERIES OF LOOSELY DEFINED YET FOUNDATIONAL FOR THIS TYPE OF IMAGERY CONCEPTS SUCH AS PATRIOTISM, NATIONAL SPIRIT AND PRIDE, AND "NATURAL," "ORGANIC" BONDS DEFINING THE SENSE OF BELONGING TO RUSSIA AS A TRANS-BORDER POLITICAL COMMUNITY.
282	WE STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME INEQUALITY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM FOR A PANEL OF 100 COUNTRIES FOR THE 1971-2010 PERIOD. USING A PANEL GRANGER NON-CAUSALITY APPROACH, WE REJECT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF GRANGER NON-CAUSALITY RUNNING FROM INCOME INEQUALITY TO ECONOMIC FREEDOM, BUT NOT VICE VERSA. FROM A SERIES OF DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATIONS WE SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF INCOME INEQUALITY ON ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS NEGATIVE AND ROBUST TO THE INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL CONTROLS. IN PARTICULAR, INEQUALITY IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE COMPONENTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE, DOMESTIC MARKET REGULATION AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION. WE ARGUE THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF INEQUALITY ON ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ELITE CONVERTING ITS ECONOMIC POWER INTO DE FACTO POLITICAL POWER TO DEFEND ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS; THESE INTERESTS RUN COUNTER TO ECONOMIC FREEDOM, DISCOURAGING INNOVATION AND COMPETITION AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE ELITE'S RENTS. FINALLY, WE SHOW THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM DECREASES WITH INCOME INEQUALITY EVEN IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, SUGGESTING THAT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT ECONOMIC FREEDOM FROM ERODING. WE ARGUE THAT THE LATTER FINDING CORRESPONDS TO A SYSTEM OF POLITICAL CAPITALISM OR CAPTURED DEMOCRACY, WHERE A POWERFUL ECONOMIC ELITE CAN NEVERTHELESS EXERCISE DE FACTO POLITICAL POWER BY COOPERATING WITH POLITICIANS AND OTHER DECISION-MAKERS FOR THEIR MUTUAL BENEFIT.
283	IN RECENT YEARS, RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL REFORM HAS GROWN TO BE A MAJOR CONCERN OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND DONOR ORGANISATIONS. PART OF THIS CONCERN HAS FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE POOR. HOWEVER, LITTLE EFFORT HAS GONE INTO UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF JUSTICE SECTOR INSTITUTIONS IN SHAPING THE OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITS OF REDISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE ACTUAL WORKINGS OF OBSTACLES ENTRENCHED WITHIN THE JUSTICE SECTOR TO LAND REFORM, FOR EXAMPLE. INSTEAD, PRO-MARKET SCHOLARS CITE DIFFICULT LEGAL PROBLEMS AS A REASON TO TURN AWAY FROM STATE-LED LAND REFORM AND TOWARD MARKET-ORIENTED LAND POLICIES. YET AS THIS PAPER SHOWS, A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF DYNAMICS AROUND LAND REFORM IN THE PHILIPPINES SUGGESTS THAT POLITICAL-LEGAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW CAN BE OVERCOME UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. IT IS ARGUED THAT FOR RURAL POOR CLAIMANTS IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO A SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR POLITICAL-LEGAL MOBILISATION, PARTICULARLY AN ALTERNATIVE 'RIGHTS-ADVOCACY' OUTREACH NETWORK, AND ALSO TO ADOPT AN INTEGRATED POLITICAL-LEGAL STRATEGY. AN INTEGRATED POLITICAL-LEGAL STRATEGY IS ONE THAT IS CAPABLE OF ACTIVATING STATE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW, EXPLOITING INDEPENDENT STATE ACTORS' PRO-REFORM INITIATIVES, AND RESISTING THE LEGAL AND EXTRA-LEGAL MANOEUVRES OF ANTI-REFORM ELITES. HOWEVER, SUCH A STRATEGY APPEARS TO HAVE LIMITS AS WELL.
284	PURPOSE - THE PAPER ENDEAVOURS TO PROPOSE A PAKISTANI MODEL OF DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH PAKISTAN'S UNIQUE CULTURE AND SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECHES AND IDEOLOGY OF MUHAMMAD ALI JINNAH, THE FOUNDER OF PAKISTAN, IN AN ATTEMPT TO OUTLINE HIS VISION OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES IN PAKISTANI SOCIETY. FINDINGS - THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES FOUR KEY DIMENSIONS OF JINNAH'S VISION: FIRST, DEMOCRATISATION ENSURING THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SPHERES OF LIFE. SECOND, AN EGALITARIAN VERSION OF ISLAM, CONSIDERED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. THIRD, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A STRICT RULE OF LAW WITH NO ROOM FOR FAVOURITISM AND DISCRIMINATION. AND FOURTH, SPECIAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES FOR MINORITIES, WOMEN AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. THE FOUR DIMENSIONS ARE ON THE WHOLE INCLINED TOWARDS A SOCIAL CASE OF DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - A DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT MODEL BASED ON JINNAH'S PRINCIPLES MAY HELP PAKISTANI ORGANISATIONS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE COUNTRY'S DIVERSE HUMAN RESOURCES. WITH ITS FOCUS ON ISLAMIC EGALITARIAN PRINCIPLES, THE MODEL MAY ALSO BE USEFUL FOR DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT IN OTHER MUSLIM MAJORITY COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE CONCEPT OF DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT REMAINS LARGELY UNEXPLORED IN ISLAMIC SOCIETY. IN THIS RESPECT, THE PAPER OFFERS A UNIQUE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE OF THE POPULATION AND WORKFORCE DIVERSITY.
285	SOUTH AFRICA HAS OVERCOME ADVERSE INITIAL CONDITIONS TO ACHIEVE A REMARKABLE FISCAL TRANSFORMATION SINCE THE 1994 DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS, HELD AMID UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW AND RESIST POPULIST SPENDING PRESSURES. CONSTITUTIONALLY BASED, DURABLE AND CREDIBLE FISCAL REFORMS HAVE CONTAINED SPENDING AND RENDERED POLICY AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE, AND MORE PREDICTABLE THROUGH MULTI-YEAR BUDGETING. EXTENSIVE TAX REFORM AND MORE EFFICIENT TAX COLLECTION HAVE EXPANDED REVENUE, PERMITTING LOWER TAX RATES FOR BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, AND PERSONAL TAX RELIEF. FISCAL CONSOLIDATION ALMOST ELIMINATED THE BUDGET DEFICIT BY 2005, AND WITH IMPROVED DEBT MANAGEMENT, HAS CREATED A LOWER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE DEBT BURDEN. WHILE HIGHLY CENTRALISED REVENUE-RAISING POWERS AND GREATER DECENTRALISATION OF EXPENDITURE TO SUB-NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS CREATED A VERTICAL FISCAL IMBALANCE, A STRICT NO-BAIL-OUT APPROACH HELPED CONTROL PROVINCIAL SPENDING. THE FISCAL-MONETARY POLICY MIX HAS STABILISED THE MACROECONOMY AND REDUCED UNCERTAINTY, REFLECTED INTERNATIONALLY IN NARROWED SOVEREIGN RISK SPREADS AND IMPROVED DEBT RATINGS. HOWEVER, MICROSERVICE DELIVERY IN SOCIAL EXPENDITURE HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING (IN SOME CASES OWING TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS RATHER THAN INADEQUATE FISCAL ALLOCATIONS), AND A LONG-TERM DECLINE IN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL STOCK IS ONLY BELATEDLY RECEIVING ATTENTION. THE CHALLENGE IS TO INCREASE SOCIAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE EXPENDITURE AT A SUSTAINABLE RATE AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE DELIVERY, TO AVOID UNDERMINING THE GAINS IN MACROECONOMIC STABILITY.
286	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF STUDIES OF THE RIVER CHIEF SYSTEM (RCS). IT UTILIZES A DATASET COMPRISING 363 HIGH-QUALITY PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2009 AND 2022, SOURCED FROM THE WEB OF SCIENCE AND THE CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE (CNKI), AS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANALYSIS. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH METHOD EMPLOYED IS A LITERATURE REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, CITESPACE BIBLIOMETRIC SOFTWARE (V6.2.R2) IS USED TO PERFORM KEYWORD ANALYSIS OF RCS RESEARCH. THE KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING POINTS. FIRSTLY, RESEARCH INTO RCS HAS UNDERGONE TWO PHASES. SECONDLY, THE REVIEW PRESENTS SEVERAL POINTS EMERGENT IN THE LITERATURE THAT HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS OF MUCH STUDY, INCLUDING GOVERNANCE LOGICS, THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS, OPERATIONAL MECHANISMS, POLICY EFFECTS, AND CURRENT CHALLENGES. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES KEY TRENDS IN THE EVOLUTION OF RCS, SUCH AS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, THE UTILIZATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAKE CHIEF SYSTEM, FORESTRY CHIEF SYSTEM, AND FIELD CHIEF SYSTEM, AS WELL AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT INTERNATIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDIES AND AN INQUIRY INTO LONG-TERM MECHANISMS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RCS ARE NEEDED. THIS PAPER PROVIDES THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE GROWING LITERATURE ON RCS, BASED ON PAPERS WRITTEN IN BOTH CHINESE AND ENGLISH. IT MAPS OUT KEY RESEARCH POINTS, IDENTIFIES RESEARCH TRENDS, AND PROVIDES A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH.
287	DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN THE RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH, INCLUDING AFRICAN, CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH PROBLEM. THE INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE GREW DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA WHO HAS KENYAN ROOTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO DISCUSS AND EVALUATE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND KENYA IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM IS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE NATURE OF AMERICAN-KENYAN POLITICAL RELATIONS? ARE THEY FRIENDLY AND DURABLE? DO THEY HAVE STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE FOR BOTH PARTNERS? WHAT ROLE DO GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRACY PLAY IN THESE RELATIONS? THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT STRATEGIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE US AND KENYA HAS SOLID FOUNDATIONS. IT RESULTS FROM BOTH HISTORICAL FACTORS AS WELL AS THE CURRENT PROXIMITY OF STRATEGIC GOALS, PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AFRICAN REGION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN STATE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES, THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE US AND KENYA. THIS MEANS THAT THE ISSUE OF PROMOTING DEMOCRATIC VALUES DOES NOT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN US-KENYAN RELATIONS. THE UNITED STATES IS READY TO FORGE CLOSER RELATIONS WITH KENYA EVEN WITH CONCESSIONS IN THE AREAS OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH IS A MANIFESTATION OF A REALISTIC APPROACH.
288	AS ONE OF THE KEY CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL SCIENCES THAT CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE CULTURAL FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN SOCIETIES ALONG WITH ELEMENTS SUCH AS RATIONALITY AND RULE OF LAW, SOCIAL CAPITAL HAS A SPECIAL PLACE AMONGST SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOLARS. THIS ARTICLE CLAIMED THAT RELIGION AND ITS TEACHINGS HAVE RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SOCIAL CAPITAL. CREATING SOCIAL CAPITAL BY NEGLECTING RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND USELESS BECAUSE RELIGION CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CREATING SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. THIS ARTICLE AIMED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS ON SOCIAL CAPITAL. THEREFORE, 2000 KUALA LUMPUR CITIZENS WERE INVESTIGATED BY SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING AND THE COLLECTED DATA WERE EVALUATED BY LINEAR STRUCTURAL RELATIONS (LISREL) AFTER MEASURING THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS AND SOCIAL CAPITAL IN THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS) VERSION 16. DATA ANALYSIS INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS ON SOCIAL CAPITAL (P = 0.68; T = 4.92). WITH REGARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP OF SOCIAL CAPITAL WITH RELIGION AND ACCORDING TO THE OBTAINED FINDINGS, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBED AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION OF SOCIOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIP OF ISLAM WITH SOCIAL CAPITAL IN ISLAMIC SOCIETY. CONTRIBUTION: THIS ARTICLE PROVIDED FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGIOUS AND SOCIAL IN A MUSLIM
289	EFFECTIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE RISKS OF GRASSLAND CIRCULATION IS AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE FOR IMPROVING THE MANAGEMENT OF THE GRASSLAND RENTAL MARKET. IN THIS STUDY, THE POTENTIAL RISKS IN THE GAME AMONG THE SUBJECTS OF GRASSLAND TRANSFER ARE ANALYZED THROUGH THE LENS OF REPEATED GAME THEORY. WITH THE HELP OF INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELING, WE ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIPS AND HIERARCHY AMONG THE RISK FACTORS IN GRASSLAND CIRCULATION. WE FIND THAT SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ECOLOGICAL RISKS ARE THE MAIN POTENTIAL RISKS OF GRASSLAND CIRCULATION, AND THERE ARE STRONG CORRELATIONS AMONG RISK FACTORS. A RISK HIERARCHY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SOCIAL RISK IS AT THE UPPER LEVEL, ECONOMIC RISK IS AT THE MIDDLE LEVEL, ECOLOGICAL RISK IS AT THE BOTTOM LEVEL, AND THERE ARE CROSS-LAYER EFFECTS AMONG THE VARIOUS RISK LEVELS. CONTRACT RISK, SOCIAL SECURITY RISK, AND WEALTH GAP RISK ARE THE CORE RISK FACTORS THAT TRIGGER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GRASSLAND TRANSFER. THEREFORE, THE FIRST PRIORITY OF THE PASTURE MANAGER (I.E., THE GOVERNMENT) SHOULD BE TO REGULATE THE GRASSLAND CIRCULATION MARKET AND STRENGTHEN SUPERVISION AND PUNISHMENT OF DEFAULTING SUBJECTS. SECOND, A SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN WHICH THE HERDSMEN AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE BOTH INVESTED SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. THIRD, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A "RULE OF LAW" SYSTEM INSTEAD OF "RULE OF MAN," TO AVOID THE LOSS OF GOVERNMENT CREDIBILITY CAUSED BY RENT-SEEKING.
290	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT THAT THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT LED BY NICOLA STURGEON ORGANIZED IN RESPONSE TO THE IDEA OF THE UK WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU. THE BACKGROUND OF SCOTTISH SEPARATISM AND THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE REGION IN CASE OF ITS SEPARATION ARE CONSIDERED. SCOTLAND PLANS TO HOLD A NEW INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM UNTIL 2021, AND ACCORDING TO OPINION POLLS, THE PROPORTION OF THOSE READY TO SUPPORT LEAVING THE UNITED KINGDOM IS GROWING STEADILY, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE STRUGGLE OF PM BORIS JOHNSON WITH THE UK PARLIAMENT. UNDER THE 1998 SCOTLAND ACT, WHICH LEGISLATED DEVOLUTION IN THE REGION, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLEDGED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE EU STANDARDS IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, LOCAL GOVERNANCE, FISHERIES AND AGRICULTURE, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, TRANSPORT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN SCOTLAND AND THE EU HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THE REGION RECEIVES INVESTMENTS FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION TO DEVELOP UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES SUPPORT AND EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS, WHILE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE REGION ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE WORK OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. THE RISK OF LOSING PREVIOUS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES WITH THE EU IN VIEW OF BREXIT HAS REINFORCED CENTRIFUGAL TENDENCIES AGAIN, PUTTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF SCOTLAND AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA OF THE RULING SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY.
291	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIAL ON A POST-CONFLICT SOCIETY. IT ASSESSES THE CLAIMS OF LEGAL EXPRESSIVISM, WHICH CONCEPTUALIZES CRIMINAL JUSTICE AS A MESSAGE SENDING MECHANISM THAT CAN ENUNCIATE SOCIETAL CONDEMNATION OF ATROCITIES, ESTABLISH AN AUTHORITATIVE HISTORICAL RECORD, AND STRENGTHEN RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE TRIAL OF CHARLES TAYLOR BEFORE THE SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE. FIRST, THE DISCURSIVE MESSAGING BY THE PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE IS ANALYSED. SECOND, THIS ARTICLE CONDUCTS AN EMPIRICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE RECEPTION OF THESE MESSAGES BY OPINION LEADERS IN LIBERIA. DEPARTING FROM THE LITERATURE ON EXPRESSIVISM, IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT THE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, NOT ONLY THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE, HAVE EXPRESSIVIST POTENTIAL. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE ENQUIRY, AN ATTENTIVE ELITE AUDIENCE IN MONROVIA WAS FOUND TO HOLD COMPLEX VIEWS. THE TAYLOR TRIAL DID NOT STIGMATIZE PARTICULAR BEHAVIOUR, BUT THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF SO-CALLED 'HISTORICAL TRUTHS' BEING VALIDATED, DESPITE THE COURT'S DOUBTFUL PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY. MANY RESPONDENTS DISCERNED A DETERRENT EFFECT OF THE TRIAL, WITH YOUTH LEADERS, IN PARTICULAR, USING TERMS EXACTLY CONSONANT WITH EXPRESSIVIST THEORY. FOR THEM, THE TRIAL 'SENDS A MESSAGE'OR 'TELLS FUTURE LEADERS' THAT ONE CANNOT WAGE AGGRESSIVE WAR OR COMMIT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WITHOUT BEING CALLED TO ACCOUNT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT TRIAL PROCEEDINGS CAN INDEED FUNCTION AS A MECHANISM OF DETERRENCE BY SENDING MESSAGES.
292	THE EXISTENCE OF A MARKET SYSTEM SHELTERED BY THE RULES OF FREE COMPETITION WITH SOME RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS GIVEN BY THE LEGISLATOR AND THE REGULATOR, PUT FORWARD THE NEED TO VERIFY THE DYNAMIC THAT IS RECORDED AS PART OF THIS REALITY IN THE FACE OF SANCTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST LAW DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS SECTOR IN COLOMBIA HAVE OCCURRED SINCE 2002 TO DATE. BEHAVIORS THAT GENERATE ABOVE MARKET PLAYERS HAVE CONSEQUENCES THAT AFFECT COMPETITION LAW CONSTITUTIONALLY-GUARANTEED, INJURING FINALLY TO SERVICE USERS. AN ANALYSIS OF MARKET CONDITIONS FOR NATURAL GAS IN COLOMBIA (PUBLIC RESIDENTIAL TIED TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES OF THE RULE OF LAW) IS DONE IN THIS ARTICLE FROM THE SANCTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS TO DATE HAVE BEEN TAKEN AGAINST COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THE SECTOR. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ACTS THAT LIMIT AND RESTRICT COMPETITION AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE MARKET IS NECESSARY TO ANALYZE THE SECTOR CHARACTERISTICS RECORDED. THE BACKGROUNDS ARE FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF THIS STUDY TO IDENTIFY THE ACTORS INVOLVED AND THE CONDITION THEREOF THEY DO. FROM THIS DESCRIPTIVE EXERCISE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO APPROACH A STUDY OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND UNFAIR COMPETITION ARISING IN THE SECTOR FROM THE YEAR 2002 ON THE BASIS OF THE DECISIONS RENDERED BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND NOW THE SUPERINTENDENCY OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, IN INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST COMPANIES.
293	THE TERM 'GOVERNANCE', IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AS WELL AS IN POLITICAL PRACTICE, HAS EMERGED AS A RESULT OF A CRISIS OF INTERVENTIONIST THINKING. POST-INTERVENTIONIST THEORIES AND CONCEPTS OF PLURALIST SOCIETIES HAD RAISED QUESTIONS THAT THE IDEA OF GOVERNANCE PROMISED TO ANSWER BY REPLACING MORE RIGID CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL STEERING BY NEW IDEAS OF COOPERATION, NEGOTIATION, COPRODUCTION, HYBRID COMMUNICATION, SELF-REGULATION, NETWORK, ETC. IT IS NOT SO MUCH THIS OFTEN-CRITICIZED BLURRINESS OF THE SEMANTICS OF GOVERNANCE THAT PROVOKES QUESTIONS AGAIN, BUT RATHER THE SPECIFIC AMALGAMATION OF SOCIAL THEORY AND PRACTICE CONNECTED TO GOVERNANCE. AS AN EFFECT OF THIS AMALGAMATION, THE 'SOCIAL-SCIENTIFICATION' OF SOVEREIGNTY AND CONTROL TENDS TO PRODUCE TWO CONTRADICTORY EFFECTS. BESIDES THE TRADITIONAL GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM, USUALLY CONNECTED WITH A STRONG RULE OF LAW, A VERY FAR-REACHING PRESSURE AND DEMAND OF COOPERATION AND PARTICIPATION ARE BECOMING POWERFUL, CLOSELY GUARDED UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF GOVERNANCE. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE RECOLLECTION OF THE FUNCTIONAL NUCLEUS OF GOVERNANCE IS SUGGESTED WITH THE TERM 'REGULATION' AND WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON CERTAIN DELEGALIZING EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE. THE INTENTION OF THIS PROPOSAL IS NEITHER TO DISMISS THE PERSPECTIVE OF GOVERNANCE IN TOTO, NOR TO REVERT TO INTERVENTIONIST CONCEPTS, BUT RATHER TO SET THE STAGE FOR A DISPASSIONATE AND DETACHED ANALYSIS OF LAW AND POLITICS.
294	THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW IMMIGRANTS FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION (FSU) WHO HAVE LIVED IN ISRAEL FOR AN AVERAGE OF 10 YEARS PERCEIVE WHITE-COLLAR CRIME. AFTER A SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE ABOUT THE SOVIET ECONOMY AND HOW SOVIET SOCIETY REGARDED WHITE-COLLAR CRIME, WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FSU IMMIGRANTS' TOLERANCE OF WHITE-COLLAR CRIME (RELATIVE TO THEIR ISRAELI COUNTERPARTS) AND THE DEGREE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN RUSSIAN CULTURE AND SOCIETY. THIS INVOLVEMENT WAS ANALYZED USING A SYSTEM OF VARIABLES THAT INDICATE THE SUBJECTS' AFFINITY FOR RUSSIAN CULTURE AND SOCIETY AND REJECTION OF (ISOLATION FROM) ISRAELI SOCIETY. THE STUDY'S 1,028 PARTICIPANTS ARE A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE OLIM (IMMIGRANTS TO ISRAEL) FROM THE FSU BETWEEN 1990 AND 2005. OUR FINDINGS REINFORCED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE MORE INVOLVED THESE IMMIGRANTS ARE IN RUSSIAN CULTURE AND SOCIETY, AND THE MORE ALIENATED THEY ARE FROM ISRAELI SOCIETY, THE MORE PERMISSIVE THEIR VIEW OF WHITE-COLLAR CRIME. NONETHELESS, OUR STUDY EXPLAINS 27 % OF THE VARIANCE IN THEIR VIEW OF WHITE-COLLAR CRIME. HENCE THE QUESTION REQUIRES FURTHER RESEARCH. OUR FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE DECISIVE IMPACT OF THE SOVIET PROCESS OF SOCIALIZATION ON THE VALUES, PERSPECTIVES, AND BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF POST-SOVIET MAN AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THEIR CONCEPTION OF ISRAELI DEMOCRACY.
295	USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE 2007 SYDNEY APEC MEETING, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A CRITIQUE OF THE PROTEST POLICING LITERATURE. WHILE IT IS ACCEPTED THAT INTERNATIONAL SUMMITS SUCH AS APEC ARE EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS, WHICH ARE POLICED DIFFERENTLY, THE VIEW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL DEMOCRATISATION OF PROTEST POLICING ACROSS LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES IS CONTESTED. SINCE THE BATTLE OF SEATTLE IN 1999 AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TERROR ATTACKS OF 2001, THE POLICING OF PROTEST HAS COME TO ENTAIL A COMPLEX COMBINATION OF 'HARD' AND 'SOFT' TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF POWERS FORMERLY RESERVED ONLY FOR THE SECURITY SERVICES. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE THREATENED, THE DOCTRINE OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS RISKS VIOLATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDERMINED. INCREASINGLY, POWER RESIDES IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE STATE AND POLICING BECOMES POLITICISED AS A CONSEQUENCE. THAT POLITICISATION IS ACCENTUATED AT INTERNATIONAL EVENTS SUCH AS APEC WHERE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND, IN TURN, THE POLICE ARE SUBJECT TO SUPRANATIONAL PRESSURE EXERTED BY MARKET FORCES UNDER CONDITIONS OF GLOBAL NEOLIBERALISM. ACCORDINGLY, HOST NATIONS SET OUT TO SHOWCASE SECURITY IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE HOST CITIES AS SAFE PLACES FOR TOURISM AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT. IN LIGHT OF THE ABOVE, AND IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO WHAT SOME PROTEST POLICING SCHOLARS SUGGEST, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO REGARD THE POLICE AS PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN THE REPRESSIVE STATE APPARATUS.
296	WHILE OTHER FORMS OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIME IN THE ASIA PACIFIC HAVE BEEN SECURITIZED - THAT IS, REPRESENTED BY POLICY ELITES AND SECURITY ACTORS AS CRUCIAL OR EXISTENTIAL THREATS TO NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SECURITY - TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME HAS BEEN UN(DER)SECURITIZED. IT WARRANTS LITTLE MENTION IN REGIONAL SECURITY STATEMENTS OR THE SECURITY CONCERNS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. YET THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ILLEGAL LOGGING AND TIMBER SMUGGLING, WILDLIFE SMUGGLING, THE BLACK MARKET IN OZONE-DEPLETING SUBSTANCES AND DUMPING OF OTHER FORMS OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND CHEMICAL FIT THE (IN)SECURITY PROFILE APPLIED TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIME. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS THE MAIN FORMS OF TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AND ASSESSES THE 'FIT' WITH A 'CRIME AS SECURITY' FRAMEWORK. IT SHOWS THAT TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME GENERATES THE KINDS OF 'PERNICIOUS EFFECTS... ON REGIONAL STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT, THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE WELFARE OF THE REGION'S PEOPLE' THAT THE ASEAN DECLARATION ON TRANSNATIONAL CRIME IDENTIFIED AS MATTERS OF SERIOUS CONCERN. THE ANALYSIS DRAWS ON SECURITIZATION THEORY TO UNDERSTAND THE LACK OF A 'SECURITIZING MOVE' AND TO EXPLAIN WHY SECURITY ELITES DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROBLEM WARRANTS SERIOUS ATTENTION. THE POSSIBILITIES EXPLORED HERE INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL INERTIA, CONFUSION ABOUT REFERENT OBJECTS, INSTITUTIONAL INCAPACITY, MIXED POLICY SIGNALS AND THE EXCLUSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERTISE FROM A CLOSED COMMUNITY OF SECURITY ELITES.
297	THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE HAS CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE CONGRESS ENACTED THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA) IN 1946. YET CONGRESS HAS DONE LITTLE TO MODERNIZE THE APA IN THOSE INTERVENING SEVENTY-SEVEN YEARS. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE APA HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED. FEDERAL COURTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REFASHIONED THE APA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY ACTION. PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY, CALLS TO RETURN TO EITHER THE STATUTORY TEXT OR THE ORIGINAL MEANING (OR BOTH) HAVE INTENSIFIED IN RECENT YEARS. "APA ORIGINALISM" PROJECTS ABOUND. AS PART OF THE NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW'S SYMPOSIUM ON THE HISTORY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT AND JUDICIAL REVIEW, THIS ESSAY PROVIDES A LITERATURE REVIEW OF THE COMPETING METHODOLOGIES FOR INTERPRETING THE APA: TEXTUALISM, ORIGINALISM, PURPOSIVISM (OR PRAGMATISM), AND A MORE DYNAMIC OR LIVING APPROACH THAT ENCOURAGES ADMINISTRATIVE COMMON LAW. THIS ESSAY CONCLUDES BY EMBRACING A MIDDLE-GROUND APPROACH: THE SUPREME COURT (AND LOWER COURTS) SHOULD ANSWER OPEN STATUTORY QUESTIONS BASED ON THE TEXT, STRUCTURE, CONTEXT, AND ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE APA. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO INTERPRETIVE QUESTIONS COURTS HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED, THE PULL OF STATUTORY STARE DECISIS SHOULD BE QUITE STRONG, AND REFORM TO THOSE PRECEDENTS SHOULD BE LEFT LARGELY TO CONGRESS. THIS APPROACH BEST ADVANCES ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'S RULE-OF-LAW VALUES SUCH AS PREDICTABILITY, RELIANCE, STABILITY, AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.
298	THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE WHERE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAWYERS PRACTICE IS FRAUGHT WITH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PRESSURES THAT UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF LAWYERS TO EXERCISE INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. A LACK OF CANDID LEGAL ADVICE IN THIS SPACE NOT ONLY REMOVES A PIVOTAL FAIL-SAFE BETWEEN LEGAL AND ILLEGAL STATE ACTION BUT ALSO PRECARIOUSLY IMBALANCES THE POWERFUL ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, EXPOSING IT TO UNDUE POLITICAL INFLUENCE. FOR THESE REASONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS MUST BE MADE TO SUPPORT AND NURTURE LAWYERS' ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINE THE BOUNDS OF LEGALITY. PREVIOUS SCHOLARSHIP HAS EXAMINED THE ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE FOR LAWYERS GENERALLY; HOWEVER, THE LEGAL ACADEMY HAS YET TO EXPLORE THE CENTRALITY OF PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OR THE STRUCTURAL PRESSURES INFLUENCING ITS EXERCISE. THIS ARTICLE JOINS A BODY OF WORK THAT ADOPTS A NEW INSTITUTIONALIST APPROACH TO PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT. IN DOING SO, THIS ARTICLE MAKES THREE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTIONS: (1) IT OUTLINES WHY INSTITUTIONALLY SUSTAINED PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE STATE; (2) IT IDENTIFIES INSTITUTIONAL FAILINGS THAT IMPEDE GOVERNMENT LAWYERS' EXERCISE OF PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT; AND (3) IT PROPOSES INSTITUTION-BASED SOLUTIONS TO FACILITATE PROFESSIONALLY INDEPENDENT CONDUCT BY GOVERNMENT LAWYERS. BY INSULATING GOVERNMENT LAWYERS FROM EXCESSIVE INTERFERENCE ON CORE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT CALLS, CIVIL SOCIETY MAY RELY ON THESE LAWYERS TO HELP PROTECT THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
299	THE MILAN TRIAL OF THE PLAGUE-SPREADERS OF 1630 IS KNOWN TO US THROUGH THE ENLIGHTENMENT READING BY PIETRO VERRI AND THROUGH MANZONI'S CATHOLIC AND ROMANTIC REINTERPRETATION. THE FORTUNE THE TRIAL HAD IN THE AGE OF THE COUNTER-REFORMATION HAS REMAINED UNKNOWN. BUT WHY DID MANZONI DEDICATE SO MUCH INTEREST TO THIS AFFAIR? THE THESIS OF THIS WORK IS THAT BEHIND THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY PLAGUE, MANZONI ACTUALLY SAW ANOTHER ONE, THE ONE THAT HAD INFECTED THE MINDS OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE IN FRANCE DURING THE TERROR. THIS IS SHOWN BY A QUOTATION THAT LATER DISAPPEARED FROM FERMO E LUCIA, THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH STRANGELY WENT UNNOTICED, REREADING STORIA DELLA COLONNA INFAME FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND WHY, FOR MANZONI, THIS SECOND WORK WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE NOVEL. FOR THE AUTHOR, THE SENTENCES OF THE JUDGES OF THE COLUMN OF INFAMY, AND THOSE OF THE PARISIAN TRIBUNALS OF THE TERROR, WERE LINKED BY THE SAME THREAD. AT THE ORIGIN OF EVERYTHING THERE WAS WHAT WE MAY DEFINE AS THE "CONSPIRACY SYNDROME," THE OBSESSION WITH THE HIDDEN ENEMY AS A FORCE CAPABLE OF UNDERMINING SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW. A CURRENT THEME IN EUROPE IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY, IT WAS A PROBLEM THAT LONG DISTURBED THE REFLECTION OF ALESSANDRO MANZONI IN THE FACE OF THE PHENOMENON OF REVOLUTION AS A GREAT MOVEMENT OF THE PEOPLE.
300	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON NATIONAL RATES OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY. INVENTION, PART OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS, IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES BEHIND ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND PATENT STATISTICS ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS A MEASURABLE INDICATOR OF INVENTIVE OUTPUT. THUS THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL PATENT STATISTICS AND MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. AS A RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH, THE EFFECT OF THE "THRESHOLD OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY" WAS OBSERVED. THIS EFFECT DEMONSTRATES THAT WHEN COUNTRIES REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ATTAIN A GENERAL INSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO INVENTIVE ACTIVITY, THE NUMBER OF PATENT APPLICATIONS BEGINS TO SHARPLY INCREASE. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT CONFIRMS THAT A COMBINATION OF FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE RULE OF LAW OR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY AIMED AT BOOSTING INNOVATION, CREATE AN OVERALL ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO PATENTING. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT "MID-RANGE EMERGING ECONOMIES", 2 INCLUDING THOSE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE(3) (CEE), WHERE THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IS LAGGING BEHIND MORE DEVELOPED COUNTERPARTS AND/OR THEIR INFLUENCE IS WEAK OR SPORADIC, HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE THRESHOLD OF INVENTIVE ACTIVITY YET. HOWEVER, THOSE CEE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ACCEDED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION FIRST HAVE MADE VISIBLE PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND INVENTION.
301	THIS CONTRIBUTION IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF LEGAL ORDER OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION (EAEU). IT IS DONE THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF THE EAEU LEGAL ORDER WITH THOSE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). IT IS ARGUED THAT THE NOTION 'EU ACQUIS' HAS BEEN EXTENDED BEYOND THE EU AND THIS BEEN EXPORTED TO LEGAL ORDERS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IT POSES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE NOTION 'ACQUIS' CART HAVE THE SAME MEANING WITHIN THE LEGAL ORDER OF THE EAEU. ON THE ONE HAND, SOME INSTITUITIONAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE EAEU AND THE EU AS WELL AS THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE EAEU LEGAL ORDER GIVE US AGROUND TO APPLY THE NOTION 'ACQUIS' WITH REGARD TO THE EAEU IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL HERITAGE OF THE INTEGRATION PROJECTS WITHIN THE POST-SOVIET AREA. ON THE OTHER HAND, CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EU AND THE EAEU LEGAL SYSTEMS (DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUPRANATIONALITY, WEAK ROLE OF THE COURT OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION, AND STRICTLY NORMATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFINITION OF THE 'UNION LAW' IN THE EAEU TREATY) BRING INTO QUESTION THE RELEVANCE OF THE NOTION OF THE 'EAEU ACQUIS'. ANALYSIS OF THE NOTION 'EAEU ACQUIS' ENCOURAGES A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NECESSITY TO REVISIT ITS NARROW SCOPE TOWARDS INCLUSION OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF COMMON VALUES, FOUNDING PRINCIPLES LIKE RULE OF LAW AND NON-DISCRINTINATION AND DIRECT EFFECT.
302	MODERNITY IS A VERY COMPLEX TERM, WHICH NEEDS GREAT PRECISION IN THE DEFINITION OF ITS MEANING. MY POINT IS THAT HEGEL PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF MODERNITY IN POST-ENLIGHTMENT, BUT HE IS ALSO WORKING WITH VERY TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS LIKE STANDE, POLIZEI AND SO ON. THIS REPRESENTS AN OBJECTIVE LIMIT OF HIS SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT, WHICH CANNOT BE INTENDED AS A PERSISTENT MODEL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC STATE-BUILDING IN THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL POINT OF VIEW HOWEVER HIS IDEA OF SOVEREIGNITY AND REPRESENTATION COULD BE USEFUL FOR US TODAY IN ORDER TO IMAGINE A NEW IDEA OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION. FOR DOING SO, WE NEED AN EXTREME EFFORT TO ELABORATE AND ACHIEVE A NEW STANDARD OF MODERNITY, PERHAPS NO LONGER BASED ON THE LIBERAL ITEMS OF INDIVIDUALISM, REPRESENTATION AND FORMAL CONSTITUTION. WE NEED TO DISCOVER A NEW MEASURE FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHICH CAN COEXIST WITH THE GROWING REALITY OF GLOBALIZATION AND HUMAN INTERCHANGE. WE CAN OF COURSE CALL IT FEDERALISM, AS A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT MEASURES IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIFE, NOT ONLY AS A RULE OF LAW BUT WITH THE SOCIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS PUT FORWARD FOR INSTANCE BY EMILE DURKHEIM AND LEON DUGUIT. AN ANSWER COULD POSSIBLY COME FROM A RE-INTERPRETATION OF A POLITICAL STRUCTURE THAT ALSO HEGEL HAD KNOWN VERY WELL: ADMINISTRATION, TOWARD AN ADMINISTRATIVE FEDERALISM.
303	THIS CONTRIBUTION FOCUSES ON THE QUESTION OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN THE ELITE OF LATE MEDIEVAL GHENT. AROUND 1300, THE URBAN PATRICIATE WAS TORN ASUNDER BY SEVERAL VIOLENT FEUDS BETWEEN LEADING FAMILIES. THOSE FEUDS FUELLED THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE GHENT PATRICIATE AND THE POLITICALLY FRUSTRATED GUILDS, AND LINKED THEMSELVES WITH LARGER POLITICAL TENSIONS IN FLANDERS. IN THE MYTH AND XVTH CENTURY, HOWEVER, LARGE-SCALE FEUDING DISAPPEARED. ELITE CONFLICTS BECAME BY NO MEANS RARE, BUT THEY BECAME LESS VIOLENT AND THEY DID NO LONGER INTERCONNECT WITH OTHER SOCIAL TENSIONS. THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE RISE OF THE STATE AND ITS PRESUMED ESTABLISHMENT OF A RULE OF LAW, THOUGH THE ASCENSION OF AN UNCONTESTED PRINCELY DYNASTY DID MUCH TO SAP THE LIFEFORCE OF LOCAL FEUDS TO BECOME BREEDING GROUNDS FOR FACTION STRIFE. INSTEAD, THE RESHAPING OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN THE GHENT ELITE WAS CLOSELY INTERLINKED WITH A RESHAPING OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF THE URBAN COMMUNITY. IN THIS NEW SETTING, CONFLICTS AND FEUDS WERE SETTLED BY PRE-EXISTING MECHANISMS OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION, WHICH WERE INHERENT IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EXTENDED FAMILIES OF THE GHENT PATRICIATE AS MANAGERS OF WEALTH, STATUS AND POLITICAL POWER. THIS PROVIDED THE HIGHLY CHARGED ELITE WITH A REMARKABLE SOCIAL STABILITY, WHICH WAS SECURED NEITHER BY THE STATE, NOR BY THE OFFICIAL WAYS OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION ORGANISED BY THE URBAN GOVERNMENT.
304	THE YEAR 2011 MARKED THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HAGUE DECLARATION OF 1991 BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. THIS DECLARATION WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO ENHANCE THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND EUROPE, BUT THE REALITY WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A RELUCTANT PROMOTION OF SEVERAL INSIGNIFICANT PROGRAMS. MEANWHILE, ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DEVELOPED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA, IT HAS BECOME AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EU-ASIA RELATIONS. WHILE ENDEAVOURING TO EXPAND ITS ECONOMIC TIES WITH CHINA, THE EU ALSO ATTEMPTS TO BE A 'NORMATIVE POWER', BUT, BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED NATURE OF THE EU'S INFLUENCE IN EAST ASIA, IT NEEDS NORMATIVE PARTNERS IN THIS REGION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EU-JAPAN RELATIONSHIP IS BECOMING MORE VITAL BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF NORMS DUE TO THE RISE OF CHINA. IN THE LAST DECADE, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASINGLY EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF VALUES AND NORMS IN ITS DIPLOMACY. AT THE SAME TIME, BOTH THE EU AND JAPAN HAVE BEEN LEADING ADVOCATES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND MULTILATERALISM, WHILE STRIVING TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, THE COLD WAR 'TRILATERALISM', WHICH WAS THE CORE OF THE WESTERN ALLIANCE, HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO THE POST-COLD WAR 'NORMATIVE PARTNERSHIP'. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF EU-JAPAN RELATIONS CAN BE APPROPRIATELY UNDERSTOOD IN THIS LIGHT.
305	MANUSCRIPT TYPE: EMPIRICAL RESEARCH QUESTION/ISSUE: WE EXAMINE WHETHER ANTI-DIRECTOR LAWS AND LEGAL DIRECTOR LIABILITY RULES AFFECT THE DILIGENCE OF DIRECTORS IN SETTING THE COMPENSATION OF CEOS. THE STUDY USES A WORLD-WIDE DATA SET COVERING 27 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1995 TO 2005. RESEARCH FINDINGS/RESULTS: CONTROLLING FOR A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS, WE FIND THAT INDEPENDENT OF MANAGERIAL RISK-AVERSION, CEO PAY IS ALWAYS LESS GENEROUS UNDER STRICTER ANTI-DIRECTOR RULES AND A STRONGER RULE OF LAW. DIRECTOR LIABILITY RULES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE GENEROUS PAY SCHEMES. THE RESULTS PERSIST ONCE WE CONTROL FOR THE PRESENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND CROSS-LISTING IN THE US. THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE EXISTS AN AGENCY CONFLICT BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS AND OUTSIDE DIRECTORS REFLECTED IN THE DEGREE TO WHICH DIRECTORS ACT DILIGENTLY WHEN NEGOTIATING THE PAY CONTRACT WITH THE CEO. HOWEVER, THIS CONFLICT MAY BE ALLEVIATED BY SPECIFIC LEGAL RULES MAKING BOARDS MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS. PRIVATE MEASURES OF SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION DO NOT SEEM ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF SUBSTITUTING FOR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: REDUCING MANAGERIAL AGENCY COST IS COMMONLY VIEWED AS A DESIRABLE POLICY GOAL. WE ADVOCATE THE VIEW THAT SPECIFIC LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT STRENGTHEN PROCEDURAL RIGHTS OF SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING ON DIRECTORS AND THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM HELP TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. DIRECTOR LIABILITY RULES, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO BE INEFFECTIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE.
306	THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT DEVELOPED IN THIS ESSAY IS THAT TODAY WE ARE SEEING A PROLIFERATION OF NORMATIVE ORDERS WHERE ONCE STATE NORMATIVITY RULED AND THE DOMINANT LOGIC WAS TOWARD PRODUCING A UNITARY NORMATIVE FRAMING. ONE SYNTHESIZING IMAGE WE MIGHT USE TO CAPTURE THESE DYNAMICS IS THAT OF A MOVEMENT FROM CENTRIPETAL NATION-STATE ARTICULATION TO A CENTRIFUGAL MULTIPLICATION OF SPECIALIZED ASSEMBLAGES. THIS MULTIPLICATION IN TURN CAN LEAD TO A SORT OF SIMPLIFICATION OF NORMATIVE STRUCTURES INSOFAR AS THESE ASSEMBLAGES ARE PARTIAL AND OFTEN HIGHLY SPECIALIZED FORMATIONS CENTERED IN PARTICULAR UTILITIES AND PURPOSES. THE VALENCE OF THESE PARTICULAR UTILITIES AND PURPOSES CAN RANGE FROM THE SEARCH FOR JUSTICE (THE ICC) TO NARROW SELF-INTEREST (LEX CONSTRUCTIONIS). WHILE THIS IS STILL A MINOR PROCESS IN THE LARGER SCALE OF OUR GEOPOLITY, IT SIGNALS THE BEGINNING OF A MULTI-SITED, THOUGH PARTIAL, DISRUPTION OF ITS EXISTING FORMAL ARCHITECTURE. THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CRUCIAL FRAMEWORKS THROUGH WHICH MODERN SOCIETIES, ECONOMIES, AND POLITIES (UNDER THE RULE OF LAW) HAVE OPERATED: THE SOCIAL CONTRACT OF LIBERAL STATES, SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS WE HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND IT, MODERN CITIZENSHIP, AND THE FORMAL MECHANISMS THAT RENDER CERTAIN CLAIMS LEGITIMATE AND OTHERS ILLEGITIMATE IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THESE FRAMEWORKS HAVE HELD TOGETHER COMPLEX INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, POWER AND THE LAW, WEALTH AND POVERTY, ALLEGIANCE AND EXIT.
307	RUSSIA AND THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMUNITY ARE ENGAGED IN A POLITICAL BATTLE OVER KOSOVO'S RIGHT TO BE GRANTED SOVEREIGN STATEHOOD OUTSIDE SERBIAN JURISDICTION. EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT KOSOVO'S IDENTITY AS PART OF SERBIA IS UNSUSTAINABLE, AND ANY DELAY IN GRANTING KOSOVO AT LEAST PARTIAL SOVEREIGNTY IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT, STABILITY AND SECURITY. RUSSIA, ON THE OTHER HAND, ASSERTS THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO GRANT KOSOVO INDEPENDENT STATUS WOULD SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND ENCOURAGE FURTHER ETHNIC CLEANSING AGAINST SERBS. MOSCOW'S POSITION ON KOSOVO IS BASED ON A COMPLEX SET OF INTERESTS AND CONCERNS - DOMESTIC, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL - WHICH DOMINATE THE THINKING OF RUSSIA'S MODERN POLITICAL ELITE. SINCE RUSSIA'S POSITION ON KOSOVO SEEMS UNCHARACTERISTICALLY FIRM, A UNILATERAL DECISION ON KOSOVO APPEARS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD. MOSCOW IS CONVINCED THAT IT HOLDS THE MORAL HIGH GROUND AND WILL LIVE TO SEE YET ANOTHER WESTERN 'BLUNDER', ON PAR WITH IRAQ AND AN INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AFGHANISTAN. IT IS NOW UP TO EUROPE TO PROVE THAT INDEPENDENCE WILL BRING STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW, NOT CHAOS AND INSECURITY. IF VIOLENCE RETURNS TO KOSOVO, RUSSIA AND THE WEST WILL BLAME EACH OTHER, WORSENING GENERAL RELATIONS. EU SUCCESS IN KOSOVO, AND CLOSER TIES WITH SERBIA, COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THE BALKANS AS A SOURCE OF RUSSIAN-WESTERN TENSION ONCE AND FOR ALL.
308	TERRORISM SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISRUPTS BASIC POLITICAL PROCESSES COMMON TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. COMBATING TERRORISM IS THUS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND MAINTAIN THE WELL FUNCTIONING OF TOLERANT POLITIES. HOWEVER, STATE INITIATIVES PUT IN PLACE TO COPE WITH TERRORISM MAY ALSO DAMAGE HUMAN RIGHTS, EVEN WHEN THESE MEASURES ARE FORMULATED BY ELECTED ACCOUNTABLE AUTHORITIES AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF OPEN SOCIETIES. SPAIN HAS PRECISELY BEEN AMONG THOSE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY THE WAVE OF TERRORISM INITIATED MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO ACROSS WESTERN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES, AND THUS WHERE VIOLATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS WELL AS OBSTACLES TO THE EXERCISE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH VIOLENCE BECAME PARTICULARLY SEVERE. ALSO, A CASE WHERE EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW WAS TEMPORARILY DAMAGED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE ETHNO-NATIONALIST TERRORISM PERPETRATED BY ETA (AN ACRONYM FOR EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA, MEANING BASQUE HOMELAND AND FREEDOM) BUT SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED BY EFFORTS FROM BOTH STATE INSTITUTIONS, AS A RESULT OF AN EFFECTIVE DIVISION OF POWER, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. IT IS THEREFORE AN EXPERIENCE PROVIDING SUBSTANTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND VALUABLE INSIGHTS ON HOW TO COUNTER TERRORISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES OF DEMOCRACY. ACCORDINGLY, THIS PAPER AIMS AT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON THE INTERRELATED ISSUES OF TERRORISM, HUMAN RIGHTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A CONTEXT OF POLITICAL CHANGE.
309	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE PASS-THROUGH EFFECT OF MONETARY POLICY ON BANK LENDING RATES VIS-A-VIS THE POTENTIAL MODERATING EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN AFRICA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY USES ROBUST FIXED EFFECTS PANEL DATA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES AND DATA FROM 1990 TO 2017 ACROSS 37 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AIDS IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MONETARY POLICY TRANSMISSION. A DECOMPOSITION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT INTO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT SHOWS THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS MORE INFLUENTIAL WITH REGARD TO EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTEREST RATE PASS-THROUGH COMPARED TO FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY AGAIN SHOWS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS REDUCED LENDING RATES IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE FINDINGS PRESENT RELEVANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS REGARDING EFFECTIVE TRANSMISSION OF MONETARY POLICY, BY LINKING THE PURSUIT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND THE VOICE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH LENDING RATES AND ULTIMATELY THE DEMAND FOR GROWTH CAPITAL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MONETARY POLICY. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AS CONDUITS TO MONETARY POLICY EFFECTIVENESS IN DEVELOPING AFRICAN COUNTRIES.
310	IN THIS STUDY, I INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF POST-CONFLICT TRIALS ON PEACE STABILITY IN POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES. I CONTEND THAT EMPIRICAL EFFECTS OF POST-CONFLICT TRIALS ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE PARTIALITY OF THE PROCEEDINGS. WHILE IMPARTIAL TRIALS PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW, PARTISAN TRIALS MARGINALIZE OPPOSITION FORCES AND PROVIDE SELECTIVE AMNESTIES FOR GOVERNMENT ALLIES. TO CREATE COMPARABLE INSIGHTS ON PARTIALITY LEVELS OF POST-CONFLICT TRIALS, I CONDUCT AN EXPERT SURVEY EVALUATING ALL MAJOR POST-CONFLICT TRIALS BETWEEN 1946 AND 2005 (53 TRIALS IN TOTAL). THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT MOST TRIALS WERE PARTISAN WHILE FEW REPRESENTED GENUINE INSTANCES OF ACCOUNTABILITY-SEEKING. BUILDING ON THESE INSIGHTS, A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS DISENTANGLES THE IMPACTS OF PARTISAN AND IMPARTIAL TRIALS ON PEACE STABILITY USING A GLOBAL SAMPLE OF POST-CONFLICT EPISODES (N = 265). THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF POST-CONFLICT TRIALS ON PEACE STABILITY ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PARTISAN TRIALS. HENCE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN POST-CONFLICT TRIALS AND PEACE STABILITY IS MAINLY A PRODUCT OF POWER CONSOLIDATION OPERATING THROUGH COERCIVE VICTOR'S JUSTICE. WHILE IMPARTIAL POST-CONFLICT TRIALS LIKEWISE TEND TO STABILIZE PEACE, THEIR INCIDENCE IS TOO SMALL TO TRACE A GENERALIZABLE EFFECT IN A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. IN LIGHT OF THESE FINDINGS, THIS STUDY CALLS FOR RESTRAINT WHEN MAKING CONSEQUENTIALIST ARGUMENTS ABOUT CHOICES OF POST-CONFLICT JUSTICE INSTRUMENTS.
311	THIS PAPER EXPLORES MEDIA REGULATION IN CHINA AND ARGUES THAT THE COUNTRY'S BROADCASTING REGULATORY STRATEGIES OF BECOMING MORE LEGAL-RATIONAL AND LAW BASED HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY TWO FORCES: THE CHINESE PARTY-STATE'S ATTEMPT TO RECAST THE FOUNDATION OF ITS POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, AND THE LEGITIMIZING POWER OF LEGAL RATIONALITY PER SE. THE LEGITIMIZATION OF MEDIA-REGULATORY EFFORTS HAVE PRIMARILY CENTERED ON PROCEDURAL JUSTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS: ENACTING STABLE NEW BROADCASTING LAWS (STABILITY); INSTITUTING PUBLIC CONSULTATION IN RULE MAKING (PROCEDURAL INCLUSIVENESS); STRENGTHENING LAW ENFORCEMENT (ENFORCEMENT); AND PLACING CHECKS ON ADMINISTRATIVE POWER (RESTRICTION OF STATE POWER). THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS PROCEDURAL LEGITIMIZATION ARE THAT IT PROVIDES PREDICTABILITY BY RESTRICTING ARBITRARINESS IN THE EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER AND PROVIDING SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, WHILE LIMITING REGULATORY AUTHORITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, CHINESE MEDIA REGULATION STILL REQUIRES MECHANISMS TO SECURE ITS OPERATIONAL TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND DELIBERATION TO AVOID BEING CAST AS A LEGITIMIZING RITUAL. THIS PAPER ALSO ARGUES THAT PROCEDURAL LEGALITY AND JUSTICE IS A NECESSARY, BUT INSUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR OBTAINING THE MEDIA REGULATOR'S LEGAL-RATIONAL LEGITIMACY, AND GIVEN THE STATUS OF THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION AND ITS WEAKNESSES IN POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN NATIONAL LAW MAKING, THE CONTENT OF THE MEDIA REGULATION ITSELF MUST ALSO MANIFEST THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES OF PROTECTING CITIZEN AND MEDIA RIGHTS.
312	CASES MAY BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT TO ANOTHER UNDER 28 U.S.C. 1404 FOR CONVENIENCE OR UNDER 28 U.S.C. 1407 FOR COORDINATED OR CONSOLIDATED PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS. IN FEDERAL QUESTIONS CASES, SUCH A TRANSFER MAY RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF A DIFFERENT RULE OF LAW IF THERE IS A SPLIT OF AUTHORITY AMONG THE CIRCUITS. SHOULD THE COURT RECEIVING THE TRANSFERRED CASE APPLY ITS OWN UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERAL LAW OR INSTEAD APPLY THE LAW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY THE TRANSFERRING COURT? THE FEDERAL COURTS ARE SPLIT ON THIS QUESTION OF HOW TO HANDLE SPLITS OF AUTHORITY, HENCE THE TERM "METASPLIT." IN DIVERSITY CASES THE LAW IS WELL SETTLED THAT THE LAW DOES NOT CHANGE UPON TRANSFER UNDER EITHER OF THESE PROVISIONS. THE COURT RECEIVING THE TRANSFER APPLIES THE SAME STATE LAW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY THE TRANSFERRING COURT. IN FEDERAL QUESTION CASES, ON THE OTHER HAND, PERHAPS A MAJORITY OF COURTS APPLY THE LAW OF THE TRANSFEREE COURT. THIS OUTCOME IS CORRECT AS TO TRANSFERS UNDER 1404, ALTHOUGH AN EXCEPTION FOR NONUNIFORM FEDERAL LAW-WHEN FEDERAL LAW BORROWS STATE LAW OR IS OTHERWISE FORUM DEPENDENT-SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED. FOR TRANSFERS UNDER 1407, HOWEVER, THE LAW OF THE TRANSFEROR COURT SHOULD APPLY BECAUSE UNDER 1407 THE CASE IS TO BE REMANDED TO THE TRANSFEROR COURT UPON COMPLETION OF PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS.
313	THIS ARTICLE TAKES AS ITS STARTING POINT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRELIMINARY RULING AS A FUNDAMENTAL INSTRUMENT OF THE CURRENT MULTI-LEVEL EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONALISM, SINCE IT ALLOWS FOR STRENGTHENING THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AT BOTH THE STATE LEVEL AND THE EU LEVEL (ESPECIALLY LEGAL CERTAINTY, RESPONSIBILITY, DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND OPTIMIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS). WITH SUCH A PREMISE, A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF MORE THAN DUBIOUS STRATEGIES (NOT ALWAYS APPARENTLY GUIDED BY GOOD PROCEDURAL FAITH) IS CARRIED OUT. INDEED, THESE STRATEGIES, BY ACTION OR OMISSION, BREACH ARTICLE 267 TFEU BY CHALLENGING THE FLUID ARTICULATION OF THE EUROPEAN LEGAL SYSTEM (OF NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL PROVISIONS) AS WELL AS THE CORRECT DISTRIBUTION OF THE EUROPEAN JUDICIAL POWER (BETWEEN NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL COURTS) AND, AS A RESULT, THE OPTIMAL REALIZATION OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. FINALLY, THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH PROPOSALS THAT SEEK TO IMPROVE SUPRANATIONAL JUDICIAL DIALOGUE THROUGH A TRUE SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION SUPPORTED BY A SOLID TRAINING OF JUDGES IN EUROPEAN LAW, A POSITIVE JURISDICTIONAL WILL (INSPIRED BY THE FAVOR LIBERTATIS PRINCIPLE), A RE-DIMENSION OF THE OBLIGATION TO SUBMIT THE PRELIMINARY RULING IN THE CASES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 267 TFEU AND A SPECIFIC DISCIPLINE OF A DOUBLE PRELIMINARY RULING (BOTH BEFORE THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE).
314	FEATURES OF THE AMERICAN GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR, WITH ITS GUANTANAMO BAY AND OTHER SECRET PRISONS, WHERE CAPTURED DETAINEES ARE KEPT OUTSIDE THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS, ARE BEING EMULATED BY EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES, WHICH INTRODUCE SIMILAR ILLEGAL CONCEPTS AND PRACTICES INTO THEIR PENAL POLICIES. NOW AN ENTHUSIASTIC PARTNER OF THE US IN THE WAR ON TERROR, THE BELGIAN STATE, FRACTURED INTERNALLY BY THE LINGUISTIC AND REGIONAL DIVIDE AND INCAPABLE OF FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, HAS FOLLOWED THE US IN ITS JUSTICE AND PENAL POLICIES. THE AUTHOR CHARTS THE EROSION OF LIBERAL PRINCIPLES WITHIN JUSTICE POLICIES, FROM THE ABANDONMENT OF BELGIUM'S LAW ON UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF ANTI-TERROR LAWS AND MEASURES; A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MOROCCO; AND THE CAVALIER ATTITUDE TO EVIDENCE EXTRACTED UNDER TORTURE. HE EXAMINES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EXTRADITION TO THE US OF TUNISIAN NATIONAL NIZAR TRABELSI. BELGIAN PENAL POLICY HAS U-TURNED, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MORAL PANIC OVER CHILD MOLESTER AND KILLER MARC DUTROUX, AND NOW PRISONS ARE MASSIVELY OVERCROWDED AS PUNISHMENTS ARE RATCHETED UP. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE REASON FOR BELGIUM'S APPARENT SUBSERVIENCE TO THE US AND NATO, AND ITS MOVE TO PUNITIVE PRISON POLICIES, LIES IN ITS WISH TO RETAIN ITS CENTRAL ROLE WITHIN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS AS IT STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STABILITY.
315	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO STUDY THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS (INCLUDING CIVIL LAW ORIGIN), FINANCIAL DEEPENING AND DEGREE OF REGIME AUTHORITY ON GROWTH RATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REGION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL FIRM-RELATED AND NATIONAL FACTORS FOR THE DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH USING PANEL DATA THROUGH A FIXED EFFECT MODEL. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT ENGLISH CIVIL LAW ORIGIN AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW WORK WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO INCREASE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THESE ECONOMIES; HOWEVER, THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT DO NOT ASSIST FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - DATA COVERED IS LIMITED TO FOUR YEARS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS EMPHASIZE THE PROMINENCE OF OVERCOMING INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES AND ESTABLISHING TRANSPARENT PUBLIC POLICY GOVERNING BUSINESSES AS A PRE-REQUISITE FOR SUCCESSFUL UNIVERSAL INTEGRATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TWO ASPECTS. FIRST, THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING AND ITS INTERACTION WITH THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND HOW THIS AFFECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE MANUFACTURING FIRMS. SECOND, THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNANCE, THE COUNTRY CIVIL LAW ORIGIN AND THE ECONOMIC GROWTH.
316	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE SUPPORT OF THE CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ARGUMENT BY PSYCHIATRIC MEDICINE INALDO LIRA NEVES-MANTA. MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, WHOSE MEMORY WRITTEN TO JOINING THE INSTITUTION VERSA ON THE SUBJECT, HE DEVOTES MUCH OF HIS LIFE TO INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENTS. WE UNDERSTAND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE AS PART OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE AND THEORIES OF THE PSYCHIATRIST AS WAYS OF REALIZING THE THOUGHT THAT GROUP OF DOCTORS, THROUGH WHICH MATERIALIZE THE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. THE CONCEPT OF ADDICTION AS A DISEASE OF BEHAVIOR AS ABNORMAL JURISDICTION OF THE PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC, DEFINES TWO FUNDAMENTAL POINTS OF THE APPARATUS OF MEDICINE IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY : 1 - THE CONSOLIDATION OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY AS A MEDICAL SPECIALTY, WITH ITS SPECIFIC OBJECT, APPROACHES AND PROCEDURES; 2 - THE ENTHRONEMENT OF RATIONALITY - PSI (PSYCHIATRIC, PSYCHOANALYTIC) IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, FOLLOWING THE SLOPE OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE CENTERED HYGIENIST AS EUGENICIST IN THE UNFOLDING OF THIS APPROACH. NEVES-MANTA IS HERE UNDERSTOOD AS REPRESENTATIVE OF A MEDICAL GROUP RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION AND DISSEMINATION, THROUGHOUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE THESIS THAT SUPPORTED THE USE OF DRUGS SUCH AS PHYSICAL AND MORAL DISEASE. HIS WORK AND THE INSTITUTION APPEAR ESPECIALLY AT TIMES WHEN THE RULE OF LAW WAS SUSPENDED AND GOVERNMENTALITY COUNTRY NEEDED REINFORCEMENTS.
317	IN THE REQUIREMENT OF THE "DOUBLE CARBON" GOAL, CHINA HAS CONFRONTED THE LACK OF A DRIVING FORCE FOR THE LOW-CARBON TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE LAW AND STRATEGY SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR SUPPORTING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IN THIS STUDY, A FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH A MULTI-LEVEL QUANTITATIVE INDEX SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY (MILC) THROUGH THE ENTROPY TOPSIS METHOD WAS DEVELOPED. IT CAN NOT ONLY REFLECT THE LEGAL SUPPORT FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN FOUR AREAS BASED ON THE "3R" PRINCIPLE, BUT ALSO RESPOND TO THE PROCESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IMPROVEMENT DYNAMICALLY. THE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT EFFECT CAN BE APPLIED AND ANALYZED IN CHINA'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR THE PERIOD FROM 2009 TO 2022, WHICH CAN RESPOND TO THE PROCESS OF LEGAL IMPROVEMENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT DYNAMICALLY. THE OBTAINED RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA'S CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND ITS RULE-OF-LAW GUARANTEE SYSTEM ARE STILL FACING MANY CHALLENGES, SUCH AS THE LOW SYSTEMATIC DEGREE OF LEGALIZATION FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, UNMATCHED SUPPORTING LEGAL SYSTEM, AND BACKWARD CONCEPTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY LEGALIZATION. VARIOUS SUGGESTIONS ACCORDING TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF A LEGAL SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY WERE OBTAINED, WHICH CAN NOT ONLY ENCOURAGE A REDUCTION IN RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND CARBON REDUCTION FROM THE VIEW OF SYSTEMATIC LEGALIZATION, BUT ALSO PROMOTE SOCIOECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION TO MATCH THE GOAL OF "DOUBLE CARBON".
318	DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH ACROSS TWO STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY IN THE LATE 2010S, THIS PAPER TRACES THE CAUSES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE POLITICISATION OF BUREAUCRATS IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHORITARIANISATION. IT ARGUES THAT POLITICISATION OF BUREAUCRATS CANNOT SOLELY BE TAKEN AS A REFLECTION OF THE EROSION OF BUREAUCRATIC AUTONOMY AND CAPACITY BUT MUST BE EXPLORED FURTHER TO REVEAL HOW BUREAUCRATS COPE WITH AUTHORITARIAN PRESSURE AS WELL SOCIO-LEGAL DESTABILISATIONS TO PRESERVE THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ETHOS. TO THIS AIM, I DEMONSTRATE HOW BUREAUCRATS GET POLITICISED IN RESPONSE TO AUTHORITARIAN POLICIES AND, IN TURN, LABOUR TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW DESPITE POLITICO-LEGAL RISKS. THE PAPER PARTICULARLY FOCUSES ON HOW BUREAUCRATS WEAVE POLITICAL SOLIDARITY AND CIRCULATE ANTI-GOVERNMENT DISCOURSES AND HOW THEY USE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL-REGULATORY REPERTOIRE AND ARCHIVES TO DETER AND 'CORRECT' UNLAWFUL PRACTICES THROUGH THEIR EVERYDAY WORK. THE PAPER GENERATES INSIGHTS INTO THE FASHIONINGS OF POLITICAL SUBJECTIVITIES AND AGENCY BY BUREAUCRATS THROUGH THEIR LABOURING IN THE FACE OF AUTHORITARIAN INTERVENTIONS, LEGAL DISRUPTIONS AND THE INCREASING INTERACTIONS WITH THE CITIZENRY. IN DOING THIS, MY OBJECTIVE IS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE EVERYDAY WORKINGS OF AUTHORITARIAN STATE AND TO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF THE WAY THE LAW IS 'MADE REAL' (LATOUR, 2002) ACROSS MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN BUREAUCRATS AND THE CITIZENRY.
319	AUSTRALIA'S MIGRATION ACT 1958 (CTH) PROVIDES FOR VISAS THAT HONOUR AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL NON-REFOULEMENT OBLIGATIONS; IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR VISAS TO BE REFUSED OR CANCELLED ON CRIMINAL GROUNDS, RESULTING IN REMOVAL FROM AUSTRALIA. IN 2014, AUSTRALIA INTRODUCED MANDATORY VISA CANCELLATION FOR CERTAIN CRIMINAL NON-CITIZENS SENTENCED TO 12 MONTHS OR MORE IN PRISON. COINCIDING WITH THESE CHANGES WAS THE CODIFICATION OF ASPECTS OF REFUGEE AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, THE SEVERING OF REFERENCES TO THE 1951 CONVENTION RELATING TO THE STATUS OF REFUGEES, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF SECTION 197C IN THE MIGRATION ACT, WHICH PROVIDES THAT NON-REFOULEMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE IRRELEVANT WHEN CONSIDERING THE POWER TO REMOVE NON-CITIZENS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE CHANGES IN THE LAW, ANALYSING THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPLEX LEGAL PROVISIONS WHICH GOVERN THE LEGAL POSITION OF THOSE SEEKING PROTECTION OR OWED INTERNATIONAL NON-REFOULEMENT OBLIGATIONS. THIS ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT APPEAR TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THESE CHANGES. THESE INCLUDE RISKS THAT AUSTRALIA'S INTERNATIONAL NON-REFOULEMENT OBLIGATIONS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED OR SAFEGUARDED, RESULTING IN SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONCERNED, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF INDEFINITE DETENTION OR REFOULEMENT. THEY ALSO INCLUDE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND UNCERTAINTY, DELAY, AND COST IN ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM FOR DECISION MAKING AND REVIEW.
320	BETWEEN 2007 AND 2015, THE RULING PARTY OF POLAND WAS THE PRO-EUROPEAN, LIBERAL-CONSERVATIVE AND STRICT FISCAL POLICY-ORIENTED CIVIC PLATFORM. IN 2015, CIVIC PLATFORM LOST IN BOTH THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (10 MAY) AND THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (25 OCTOBER). THE WINNER WAS THE CONSERVATIVE-NATIONALISTIC AND EU-SCEPTICAL 'LAW AND JUSTICE' PARTY (PIS) LED BY JAROSLAW KACZYNSKI. A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS BEGAN WHEN THE NEWLY ELECTED PARLIAMENT CHANGED THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND THE CRISIS DEEPENED AS A RESULT OF MANY NEW REFORMS, DIVIDING THE NATION. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THIS DIVISION OF THE CITIZENS HAS A SCHMITTIAN NATURE. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN POLAND, FOCUSING ON THE SCHMITTIAN DEBATE THAT HAS APPEARED IN THE ACADEMIC, INTELLECTUAL AND JUDICIAL DISCUSSIONS AND SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE ACTIONS OF KACZYNSKI. THE PAPER CONSIDERS THREE MAIN QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2017? (2) WHAT ARE THE SCHMITTIAN QUESTIONS IN THE DEBATE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW? (3) HOW IS KACZYNSKI'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY FORMULATED? THE LANGUAGE OF THE DEBATES IS AT TIMES BRUTAL. THIS, BUT NOT ONLY THIS, REMINDS THE READER OF SCHMITT'S FRIEND-ENEMY DIVISION. MOREOVER, KACZYNSKI'S POLITICAL POWER REMINDS US OF THE POWER OF SCHMITT'S SOVEREIGN.
321	THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING (DSU) AMENDMENT NEGOTIATION AIMS TO FIX STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE DSU SINCE 1995 AND TO INTRODUCE MORE DETAILED AND COHERENT PROVISIONS IN THE DSU SO AS TO ENHANCE RULE OF LAW. WHAT HAS NOT RECEIVED AN ADEQUATE ATTENTION IN THIS DISCUSSION, HOWEVER, IS POSSIBLE IMPLICATION OF CERTAIN DSU AMENDMENT PROPOSALS VIS-A-VIS DEVELOPING MEMBERS. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS BEING TABLED, WHILE PROVIDING AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE WTO'S DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM (DSM) BY FILING THE LOOPHOLES IN THE SYSTEM, COULD ARGUABLY POSE NEW CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING MEMBERS' ENHANCED PARTICIPATION IN A FUTURE DSM. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME OF THE PROPOSALS FOR STRENGTHENED S&D TREATMENT IN THE DSU, AS PROPOSED BY CERTAIN DEVELOPING MEMBERS, MAY RUN THE RISK OF NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE NEUTRALITY OF THE WTO AS AN ADJUDICATOR. AN AMENDED DSU SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE PARTICIPATION OF DEVELOPING MEMBERS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME SPECIFIC METHODS TO FACILITATE THE PARTICIPATION SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CHOSEN FOR THE INTEGRITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATING PROCEEDING. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS INTO THESE ASPECTS OF THE DSU AMENDMENT NEGOTIATION. IT PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTEREST OF DEVELOPING MEMBERS WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEEDINGS, SO AS TO ACHIEVE THE BASIC OBJECTIVES OF THE DSU AMENDMENT NEGOTIATION.
322	COSMOPOLITANS OFTEN ARGUE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS A HUMANITARIAN RESPONSIBILITY TO INTERVENE MILITARILY IN ORDER TO PROTECT VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS FROM VIOLENT THREATS AND TO PURSUE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CONDITION OF COSMOPOLITAN JUSTICE BASED ON THE NOTION OF A GLOBAL RULE OF LAW'. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ARGUE THAT MANY OF THESE COSMOPOLITAN CLAIMS ARE INCOMPLETE AND UNTENABLE ON COSMOPOLITAN GROUNDS BECAUSE THEY IGNORE THE SYSTEMIC AND CHRONIC STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT UNDERWRITE THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE HUMANITARIAN THREATS. BY WAY OF EXAMINING COSMOPOLITAN ARGUMENTS FOR HUMANITARIAN MILITARY INTERVENTION AND HOW SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS ARE FURTHER IGNORED IN ITERATIONS OF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT MANY CONTEMPORARY COSMOPOLITAN ARGUMENTS ARE GUILTY OF FOCUSING TOO NARROWLY ON JUSTIFYING A RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THE SYMPTOMS OF CRISIS VERSUS DEMANDING A SIMILARLY ROBUST JUSTIFICATION FOR A RESPONSIBILITY TO ALLEVIATE PERSISTENT STRUCTURAL CAUSES. ALTHOUGH THIS ARTICLE RECOGNIZES THAT IMMEDIATE PRINCIPLES OF HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION WILL, AT TIMES, BE NECESSARY, THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO WHAT WE ARE CALLING PRINCIPLES OF JUS ANTE BELLUM (RIGHT BEFORE WAR) AND TO STRESS THAT CURRENT COSMOPOLITAN ARGUMENTS ABOUT HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION WILL REMAIN INSUFFICIENT WITHOUT THE INCORPORATION OF ROBUST PRINCIPLES OF DISTRIBUTIVE GLOBAL JUSTICE THAT CAN PROVIDE SECURE FOUNDATIONS FOR A MORE THOROUGHGOING COSMOPOLITAN CONDITION OF PUBLIC RIGHT.
323	THIS ESSAY ADDRESSES A LONGSTANDING CONCERN IN AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE: THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS OF DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS WILL WORK TOGETHER TO EVADE A LEGAL LIMIT IMPOSED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNMENTS. IN THE PAST, WITH THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN THE LEAD, COURTS WERE PRONE TO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE INTERGOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS, ON VIGILANT GUARD AGAINST WHAT THE COURT CALLED IMPROPER "WORKING ARRANGEMENTS." JUDICIAL VIGILANCE, HOWEVER, HAS LONG SINCE WANED, A PROBLEMATIC DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS ASSUMED ADDED SIGNIFICANCE OVER TIME AS INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY MULTIJURISDICTIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED IN NATURE. HE ESSAY OFFERS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THIS PHENOMENON AND ITS MANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR MORE EXACTING JUDICIAL SCRUTINY OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS. WITHOUT SUCH SCRUTINY, MODERN SILVER PLATTER DOCTRINE, WHICH ALLOWS ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE ILLEGALLY SECURED BY NON-FORUM AGENTS FOUND TO BE ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF AGENTS OF THE FORUM COURT, IS PERMITTED TO REIGN SUPREME. THE ESSAY THUS PICKS UP WHERE MID-TWENTIETH-CENTURY COURTS LEFT OFF PROVIDING A REINVIGORATED FRAMEWORK TO SMOKE OUT FORUM GOVERNMENT AGENT INVOLVEMENT IN INVESTIGATIONS AND CONDEMN THE LEGAL EVASION THAT IT ALLOWS. IN DOING SO, THE ESSAY SHINES A SPOTLIGHT ON A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MATTER IMPLICATING CORE RULE-OF-LAW AND GOVERNMENTAL TRANSPARENCY VALUES, WHICH WILL ASSUME EVER-GREATER IMPORTANCE IN COMING YEARS AS GOVERNMENTS ACCELERATE THEIR COMBINED INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS IN THE BATTLE AGAINST CRIME AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM.
324	TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS (TNCS) HAVE INCREASINGLY ADDRESSED LABOUR CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FOR TNCS, HOWEVER, WEAK RULE OF LAW, POOR GOVERNANCE CAPACITY, CORRUPTION AND GAPS IN APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE MADE THE MANAGEMENT, ENFORCEMENT AND MONITORING OF LOCAL LABOUR PRACTICES PROBLEMATIC, IN THE PROCESS EXPOSING TNCS TO REPUTATIONAL RISKS AND POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL HARM. TNCS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO OVERCOME THESE CONSTRAINTS BY DEVELOPING CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY (CR) STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO SET IN PLACE CODES OF ETHICAL CONDUCT IN THE TREATMENT OF WORKER RIGHTS WHILE PROTECTING SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS AND THOSE OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AS THIS PAPER EXPLORES, TNCS ARE PURSUING THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATORY CODES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS, IN THE PROCESS, SETTING STANDARDS THAT ARE DIFFUSED TO LOCAL BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS AND IMPACTING THE REGULATORY STRUCTURES THAT GOVERN LOCAL BUSINESS BEHAVIOUR. AS THIS PAPER NOTES, HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT A ONE-WAY PROCESS OF NORM DIFFUSION BUT RATHER A SITE OF NORM RECIPROCITY, WHERE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES SHAPE THE REGULATORY OUTCOMES THAT EVOLVE. TO THIS END, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TNCS AND OTHER ACTORS (INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE STATE, CIVIL SOCIETY AND PRIVATE ACTORS) IN NORM DIFFUSION, ATTEMPTING TO MAP AND ASCERTAIN HOW RECIPROCITY IN NORM DIFFUSION SHAPES NORM AND INSTITUTIONAL OUTCOMES IN CR ACTIVITIES.
325	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX SUBJECT RELATING TO THE LINK BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS BROAD AGREEMENT THAT TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND PARTICIPATION IN FOREIGN MARKETS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) HAVE GENERALLY PURSUED A LIBERALIZATION ROUTE OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, BUT THEIR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE LOOK AT SEVEN COUNTRIES IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND EXAMINE, FROM LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVES, THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF WHY THESE COUNTRIES HAVE FAILED TO TRANSLATE THEIR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR, INTO MEANINGFUL TRADE-LED ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN ORDER TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE HAVE REVIEWED THE RELEVANT LEGAL AND POLICY INSTRUMENTS AND THE LITERATURE, VISITED FIVE OF THE SEVEN COUNTRIES, AND INTERVIEWED DIFFERENT PLAYERS IN THE LIVESTOCK VALUE CHAIN. ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE REVEALS THAT THE MAIN IMPEDIMENTS TO TRADE RELATE TO RISING SANITARY IMPORT REQUIREMENTS IN FOREIGN MARKETS AND WEAK INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY WITHIN THE HORN. THE LIMITED TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THESE COUNTRIES ALSO REDUCE THEIR CAPACITY TO MEET THESE STANDARDS. MEANINGFUL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL ACTORS AND IT TAKES PLACE INCREMENTALLY AND OVER THE LONG TERM. INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THIS PROCESS BY PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND TACKLING CORRUPTION, FACILITATING CAPACITY-BUILDING, AND ENCOURAGING REGIONAL INTEGRATION.
326	FIFTY YEARS AGO, HENRY HART AND ALBERT SACKS FAMOUSLY OBSERVED THAT THE METHODS THAT COURTS USE TO INTERPRET STATUTES ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INCONSISTENT A CONCLUSION THAT SCHOLARS AND JUDGES AGREE REMAINS EQUALLY TRUE TODAY. WHILE THERE IS VEHEMENT DISAGREEMENT OVER WHICH DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION ARE BEST, THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THAT INCREASED CONSISTENCY WOULD BE SUPERIOR TO THE STATUS QUO. SCHOLARS AND JUDGES HAVE CONSIDERED A RANGE OF WAYS TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION, BUT THEY HAVE OVERLOOKED A PATH TO CONSISTENCY THAT IS TAILOR-MADE TO RENDER THE UNPREDICTABLE MORE PREDICTABLE: STARE DECISIS DOCTRINE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES NOT ONLY THAT COURTS SHOULD GIVE DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY STARE DECISIS EFFECT, BUT ALSO THAT COURTS SHOULD GIVE EVEN STRONGER STARE DECISIS EFFECT TO DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION THAN THEY GIVE TO DOCTRINES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW THE INTERESTS THAT STARE DECISIS DOCTRINE SERVES IN THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW SETTING ARE SERVED EQUALLY WELL IN THE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY SETTING; MOREOVER, STARE DECISIS SERVES IMPORTANT RULE-OF-LAW AND COORDINATION INTERESTS IN THE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY SETTING THAT IT DOES NOT SERVE IN THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW SETTING. BECAUSE THE CASE FOR GIVING STARE DECISIS EFFECT TO DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IS STRONGER THAN THE CASE FOR GIVING STARE DECISIS EFFECT TO DOCTRINES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW, COURTS SHOULD GIVE DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION STRONGER STARE DECISIS EFFECT THAN THEIR SUBSTANTIVE LAW COUNTERPARTS.
327	IN ITS FORMER COMPOSITION, THE ARGENTINEAN SUPREME COURT DEVELOPED A STANDARD FOR SEARCHES WITHOUT JUDICIAL ORDER THAT CONSIDERABLY INCREASED POLICE ATTRIBUTIONS TO STOP, SEARCH AND SEIZE. THE OPINIONS DURING THIS PERIOD WERE INSPIRED IN THE DECISION TAKEN IN "TERRY V. OHIO". RECENTLY, EVEN THOUGH THE NEW JUSTICES HAVE RULE PROGRESSIVELY IN MANY SUBJECTS, THIS STANDARD HAS NOT CHANGED. THE LATEST OPINIONS BY THE US SUPREME COURT ON AUTOMOBILE SEARCHES AND GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION MAY ENCOURAGE A REASSESSMENT OF THE MATTER.
328	ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2021, TEXAS'S ABORTION BAN, S.B. 8, WENT INTO EFFECT EVEN AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION WAS UNDER SIEGE AT THE SUPREME COURT. IT NOT ONLY PROHIBITED ALMOST ALL ABORTIONS AFTER SIX WEEKS BUT ALSO ALLOWED ANY PRIVATE PARTY TO SUE THOSE WHO, KNOWINGLY OR UNWITTINGLY, AID OR ABET SUCH PROCEDURES. TEXAS'S LAW HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS UNPRECEDENTED AND INVENTIVE. THESE EVALUATIONS OF THE MEASURE REFLECT A WIDELY SHARED ASSUMPTION THAT THE STATE'S LEGISLATURE BROKE NEW GROUND BY EMPOWERING PRIVATE CITIZENS TO FRUSTRATE A PRESENTLY VALID CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BUT SUCH ASSESSMENTS MISS IMPORTANT HISTORICAL CONTEXT. LAWS ENABLING THE PRIVATE SUPPRESSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ENACTED, AND AGGRESSIVELY USED, THROUGHOUT AMERICAN HISTORY. INDEED, MANY OF THE MOST POTENT ELEMENTS OF S.B. 8 HAVE BEEN PREFIGURED BY SPECIFIC FEATURES OF EARLIER, ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL-RIGHTS SCHEMES. THIS ARTICLE FOREGROUNDS AND ANALYZES THESE HISTORICAL PRACTICES-WHICH IT LABELS "PRIVATE SUPPRESSION"- AS A DISTINCT MODALITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE VIA LEGAL COERCION. ITS THRESHOLD CONTRIBUTION IS THE NON-EXCLUSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVATE SUPPRESSION SCHEMES FROM THE EARLY REPUBLIC THROUGH THE WAR ON POVERTY. HAVING FLAGGED (BUT NOT EXHAUSTED) THE RANGE OF HISTORICAL EXAMPLES, IT IDENTIFIES SEVERAL REGULARITIES IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMIES FROM WHICH PRIVATE SUPPRESSION SCHEMES ARISE AND PREDICTABLE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS ON REGULATED POPULATIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS.WITH THIS GROUND ESTABLISHED, THE ARTICLE SITUATES THE PRIVATE SUPPRESSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FIRST AS A SPECIES OF POPULAR CONSTITUTIONALISM AND, ALTERNATIVELY, AS AN EXERCISE IN PRIVATIZATION. THESE TWO FRAMES ARE USEFUL BECAUSE THEY BRING INTO SHARP FOCUS PRIVATE SUPPRESSION'S LIKELY EFFECTS. BEYOND ITS PROXIMATE OPERATION, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS, PRIVATE SUPPRESSION REPRODUCES UNDERLYING SOCIAL "FACTS" THAT CAN BE USED TO JUSTIFY AND LEGITIMATE SOCIAL HIERARCHIES OF RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER. IN THIS PROCESS, IT WREAKS A NOVEL AND DISTINCTIVE HARM BY CONFIGURING SOME INDIVIDUALS INTO OBJECTIONABLE POSTURES OF VULNERABILITY AND EXPOSING THEM TO THEIR CO-CITIZENS. PRIVATE SUPPRESSION HENCE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE MARKING OUT, CALLING INTO BEING, AND REIFYING SPOILED SOCIAL IDENTITIES (E.G., CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS OF RACE OR GENDER).CONSIDERING PRIVATE SUPPRESSION DIRECTLY ALSO CASTS NEW LIGHT ON THE CONCEPT AND PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW ALONG TWO DIMENSIONS. FIRST, WHILE SEEMINGLY A LOSS OF CONTROL ON THE PART OF THE STATE, PRIVATE SUPPRESSION IS IN PRACTICE A WAY FOR THE STATE TO WEAKEN CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS-AND SO TO AMPLIFY ITS REACH AND ACHIEVE POLICY CHANGES THAT COULD NOT BE DIRECTLY WROUGHT. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO CASTS DOUBT ON A PERVASIVELY HELD PREMISE OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL DISCOURSE-I.E., THE IDEA THAT HAZARDS TO INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF POWER VARY LINEARLY WITH THE SIZE OF THE CENTRAL STATE. DIFFUSE, PRIVATIZED AUTHORITY CAN ALSO BE LIBERTY'S FOE. SECOND, PRIVATE SUPPRESSION DESTABILIZES THE ORDINARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COURTS AND THE RULE OF LAW BY CONSCRIPTING ADJUDICATION AS AN INSTRUMENT TO WEAKEN LEGALITY, RATHER THAN AS A LAW-ENFORCING TOOL. RATHER THAN THE VALIDATION OF PRECEDENT, THESE ANTECEDENT EXAMPLES SUGGEST FERTILE GROUND FOR MORAL AND LEGAL CONCERN ABOUT S.B. 8, ALL QUITE INDEPENDENT OF THE DIVISIVE QUESTION OF REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE.
329	CIVIL WAR AND VIOLENCE OFTEN FORCE LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR LANDS. MULTIPLE WAVES OF DISPLACEMENT AND (PARTIAL) RETURN GENERATE COMPLEX OVERLAPPING CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT EASILY SOLVED. AS PEOPLE RETURN TO THEIR REGIONS OF ORIGIN-SOMETIMES AFTER DECADES-THEY TEND TO FIND THEIR LAND OCCUPIED BY OTHER SETTLERS, SOME OF WHOM HOLD LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS. IN THE PLACES OF ARRIVAL, DISPLACED PEOPLE AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE'S ACCESS AS THEY SEEK TO TURN THEIR TEMPORARY ENTITLEMENTS INTO MORE DEFINITE CLAIMS. THE OVERLAPPING CLAIMS RELATED TO DISPLACEMENT POSE SERIOUS DILEMMAS TO LAND GOVERNANCE, WHICH EXISTING LAND LAWS AND LAND GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT WELL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH. THIS PAPER OUTLINES THE MAIN CHALLENGES FOR LAND GOVERNANCE AS A FIRST STEP TO MOVE THE DEBATE FORWARD. THE PAPER SUMMARISES THE KEY CHALLENGES AROUND THREE TENSIONS: FIRST, BETWEEN SHORT TERM CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS; SECOND, BETWEEN STATE AND CUSTOMARY/COMMUNITY-BASED GOVERNANCE; AND FINALLY, BETWEEN PRINCIPLES (SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO RETURN OR RESTITUTION) AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE NEW SITUATION.
330	ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE SUSTAINABLE DRIVING FORCE AND STABLE SOURCE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT GUARANTEE FOR THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY AND HIGH-QUALITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER SELECTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY AS RESEARCH OBJECTS. IT MEASURES THE EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY AT THE ENTERPRISE LEVEL USING DATA FROM THE CHINA INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE DATABASE AND THE CHINA CUSTOMS IMPORT AND EXPORT TRADE DATABASE. FURTHERMORE, BASED ON MATCHING ENTREPRENEURSHIP AT THE MACRO-LEVEL AND THE EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY AT THE MICRO-LEVEL, THE IMPACT AND MECHANISM OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON THE EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY ARE EMPIRICALLY EXAMINED. IT WAS FOUND THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP FURTHER SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY BY PROMOTING THE TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY OF ENTERPRISES. ENTREPRENEURIAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY OF STATE-OWNED AND COLLECTIVE ENTERPRISES, WHILE THEY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO PRIVATELY-OWNED, INDEPENDENT LEGAL ENTITIES, HONG KONG-MACAO-TAIWAN, AND FOREIGN-FUNDED ENTERPRISES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROMOTING EFFECT ON PRIVATELY-OWNED AND INDEPENDENT ENTERPRISES IS GREATER THAN THAT ON HONG KONG-MACAO-TAIWAN AND FOREIGN-FUNDED ENTERPRISES. FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW, REDUCING EXCESSIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND IMPROVING THE MARKET MECHANISM FOR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION FACTORS, AS WELL AS VIGOROUSLY DEVELOPING THE NON-STATE-OWNED ECONOMY, WILL ALL BE CONDUCIVE TO THE CULTIVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ENTREPRENEURS AND BETTER PROMOTION OF THE IMPROVEMENT OF EXPORT PRODUCT QUALITY.
331	THE CONCEPTUALISATION OF ARCR-SS TO JUSTICE IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL (ET) AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT ESSENTIAL FOR THE REALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS RECENTLY BEEN REAFFIRMED BY THE SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENT IN R V LORD CHANCELLOR [2017] UKSC 51. HOWEVER, REFORMS TO THE LAW AND POLICY FRAMEWORK IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN FRAMED BY GOVERNMENT AS PROVIDING A NECESSARY SHIFT AWAY FROM THE USE OF FULL HEARINGS DUE TO THE COSTS INCURRED BY BOTH THE PUBLIC AND BUSINESS.THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON THE FINDINGS OF RESEARCH WHICH TRACKED WORKERS WITH ET CLAIMS WHO COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR LEGAL ADVICE AND REPRESENTATION. THEIR EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS SHED VALUABLE LIGHT ON THE OPERATION OF THE EL' SYSTEM. MANY CLAIMANTS WERE LEFT DISSATISFIED, IN PARTICULAR THOSE WHOSE CASES DID NOT MAKE IT TO FULL HEARING. THE DATA IDENTIFY A RANGE OF BARRIERS TO JUSTICE, WHICH IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO ADVANCE THEIR CLAIMS AND TO ENFORCE REMEDIES. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE USE OF 'WORKER VULNERABILITY' IN THIS CONTEXT AND THE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS APPLIED BY POLICY-MAKERS. WITH REFERENCE TO THE RESEARCH FINDINGS, WE ARGUE THAT VULNERABILITY IS UNIVERSAL AND THAT, TO COUNTER IT, THE STATE HAS A CENTRAL ROLE TO PLAY IN BUILDING INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RESILIENCE. WE CONCLUDE BY CALLING FOR THE NEED TO RECLAIM THE CONCEPT OF ACCESS TO THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A PUBLIC GOOD, CAPABLE OF TRANSCENDING PRIVATE INTERESTS AND PROVIDING FUNDAMENTAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKER EXPLOITATION.
332	IN THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, THE CONCEPT OF LEGALLY PROTECTED INTERESTS IN CHINESE CRIMINAL LEGISLATION IS CHANGING WITH THE IMPOSITION OF NEW CONTROL MEASURES THAT ENDOW CRIMINAL LAW WITH NEW FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN SOCIAL GOVERNANCE. ACTIVE LEGISLATION WILL NOT ENTAIL THE SYSTEMIC RISK OF EXCESSIVE INTERFERENCE BY CRIMINAL LAW. CRIMINALIZATION DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH CRIMINAL LAW'S CONCEPT OF MODEST RESTRAINT. IN TERMS OF OVERALL APPROACH, WE NEED TO ESTABLISH DYNAMIC, RATIONAL AND DIVERSIFIED LEGISLATIVE MECHANISMS FOR THE FUTURE. IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC METHODS, LEGISLATION MUST MAINTAIN AN APPROACH OF ACTIVELY INTERVENTION IN THE LIFE OF SOCIETY, CHANGING THE CURRENT CENTRALIZED LEGISLATIVE MODEL. HOWEVER, DECENTRALIZED LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY ADOPT THE TRIPARTITE MODEL OF THE CRIMINAL CODE PLUS SPECIAL ENACTMENTS AND AUXILIARY CRIMINAL LAW. RATHER, IT SHOULD CONSTRUCT A WRITTEN CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEM CENTERED ON THE CRIMINAL CODE AND SUPPLEMENTED BY THE LAW ON MINOR OFFENCES, IN PARALLEL WITH CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND PUBLIC SECURITY MEASURES. THIS WILL PRODUCE A MECHANISM FOR THE SEAMLESS INCREMENTAL CONVERGENCE OF PUBLIC SECURITY ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENT LAW, MINOR OFFENCES LAW, AND CRIMINAL LAW. THE NET OF JUSTICE IS FINE-MESHED BUT ITS PENALTIES ARE LIGHT. THE ADDITION OF NEW CRIMES MUST UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, CORRESPOND TO SPECIFIC SOCIAL SITUATIONS, MAINTAIN AN ATTITUDE OF SENSITIVITY AND CLARITY TOWARD LAWLESSNESS AND REGARD CRIMINAL LAW AS A LAST RESORT, IN ORDER TO ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES LEGISLATORS CURRENTLY FACE FROM THE GROWING BODY OF CRIMINAL LAW.
333	THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS FIRST TO ESTABLISH WHETHER ANY RELATIONSHIPS EXIST BETWEEN COUNTRIES' ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, GOVERNANCE AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO CLASSIFY COUNTRIES ACCORDING TO THESE RELATIONSHIPS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES WE USED THE 10 POLICY CATEGORIES OF THE 2012 EPI AND SOME EXTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS - CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, POPULATION, POPULATION DENSITY AND GDP PER CAPITA - SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY USED IN THE LITERATURE AND DEMONSTRATED TO BE RELATED TO THE EPI. WE CONFRONT THE PROBLEM FROM A MULTIVARIATE PERSPECTIVE, USING CO-INERTIA ANALYSIS (COIA), A MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHOD THAT ALLOWS US TO DIRECTLY RELATE BOTH SETS OF VARIABLES MEASURED IN THE SAME COUNTRIES. THE MAIN RESULTS FROM THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SHOW THAT GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND PER CAPITA GDP ARE STRONGLY AND DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE EPI POLICY CATEGORIES CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN BEINGS, FORESTRY AND BIODIVERSITY AND HABITAT, AND THAT MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND NORTH AMERICA PRESENT HIGH SCORES IN ALL OF THESE VARIABLES. IN CONTRAST, THESE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE INVERSELY RELATED TO AGRICULTURE, CLIMATE CHANGE, FISHERIES AND THE EFFECTS THAT AIR POLLUTION HAS ON NATURE, AND THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, SOUTH AMERICA AND ASIA PERFORM BETTER IN THESE POLITICAL CATEGORIES BUT WITH LOWER GOVERNANCE RATES. THE EFFECT OF WATER ON NATURE AND POLITICAL STABILITY COVARIATE POSITIVELY AND BOTH RELATE NEGATIVELY TO THE SOCIAL VARIABLES. COPYRIGHT (C) 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD AND ERP ENVIRONMENT
334	REITERATING THAT UNIFIED LEGAL SYSTEMS HAVE EMERGED HISTORICALLY AS ORDERING DEVICES SUSTAINING THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETIES CAPABLE OF UPHOLDING THE STATE'S MONOPOLY OF THE LEGITIMATE USE OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, THE ARTICLE TAKES UP A SERIES OF CASES WHERE LEGAL PLURALISM OBSCURES AND CONFRONTS INTEGRATED SYSTEMS OF LEGAL MONISM. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE ROLE OF TB MACAULAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF WESTERN LAW IN INDIA AND DISCUSSES ITS APPLICATION TO A WHITE 'INTERLOPER' (NON-OFFICIAL SOJOURNER) IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY. CONTEMPORARY WESTERN INTERLOPERS ARE DISCUSSED THROUGH AN EXTENDED ANALYSIS OF THE CASE OF NIELS HOLCK, A DANE ACCUSED OF AIRDROPPING A LARGE CONSIGNMENT OF WEAPONS TO THE INDIAN SECT ANANDA MARGA FOR ITS 'SELF-DEFENSE' AGAINST THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN WEST BENGAL. INDIA'S DEMAND FOR HIS EXTRADITION IS ANALYZED ON THE BACKGROUND OF DANISH LEGAL MONISM AND OF INNOVATIVE FORMS OF INDIAN LITIGATION, INCLUDING PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION, AIMING TO INFUSE INDIAN LAW WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION AS IN THE CASE OF NANDINI SUNDAR AND OTHERS VERSUS STATE OF CHHATTISGARH. THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN THE TWO LEGAL SYSTEMS DID NOT BRING ABOUT A JURIDICAL RECONCILIATION, BUT RESULTED IN A DIPLOMATIC CRISIS THAT LED INDIA TO IMPOSE UNSPECIFIED SANCTIONS ON DENMARK. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS THE RAYMOND DAVIS CASE IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES SUCCEEDED IN RETRIEVING AN INTELLIGENCE AGENT BY SUBMITTING ITSELF TO PAKISTANI SHARIA-INSPIRED LAW, THUS ALLOWING LEGAL PLURALISM TO 'CANNIBALIZE' US LAW-WAYS AT HIGH TRANSACTION COSTS.
335	DECEMBER 1ST MARKS WORLD AIDS DAY WITH THE THEME 'GETTING TO ZERO'. THREE YEARS AGO, UNAIDS ARTICULATED WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED TO BE AN AMBITIOUS VISION, THE ASPIRATION FOR ZERO NEW HIV INFECTIONS AND ZERO-AIDS RELATED DEATHS UNDERPINNED BY ZERO DISCRIMINATION. AS WE IMAGINE THE POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA, WE CAN AND SHOULD RECONCEPTUALISE THIS VISION AS A SET OF CONCRETE GOALS. THIS VIEWPOINT ARGUES THAT TODAY'S RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD, INCLUDING ITS SHIFTING GEO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE, REQUIRES POLICY RESPONSES THAT ARE CONTEXT-SENSITIVE. WE HIGHLIGHT THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY-GLOBAL SOLIDARITY AGENDA, AS PIONEERED BY THE AFRICAN UNION IN ITS RECENT ROADMAP ON AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA, TO ILLUSTRATE WAYS IN WHICH GLOBAL HEALTH CAN BE RE-THOUGHT TO TACKLE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY CHALLENGES. IN LIGHT OF THE EMERGING DEBATE ON WHAT A POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK SHOULD LOOK LIKE, WE ARGUE THAT THE AIDS RESPONSE OFFERS LESSONS AS A PATHFINDER WHICH CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH RESPONSES IN WHICH THE MOST MARGINALISED ARE AT THE CENTRE OF THE DEBATE, HUMAN RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY IS IN PLACE FOR RESULTS FOR PEOPLE, AND COMMUNITY AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES ARE THE NORM. THESE HARD-LEARNED AND -WON PRINCIPLES OF THE AIDS RESPONSE ARE CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO REALIZE A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS ZERO INEQUALITY AND HEALTH JUSTICE FOR ALL.
336	THE DRAMATIC CHANGES OF 1989 HAVE BEEN WIDELY UNDERSTOOD AS THE CONFIRMATION OF WESTERN, LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AS THE ULTIMATE MODEL OF THE MODERN POLITY. THE FACT THAT 1989 WAS ABOUT A DUAL LANGUAGE THAT NOT ONLY EMPHASIZED THE RULE OF LAW AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS, BUT ALSO ARTICULATED IDEAS OF DEMOCRACY ALTERNATIVE TO THE MAINSTREAM LIBERAL-CONSTITUTIONAL IDEA, HAS NOT BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF INTERPRETATIONS OF POST-1989 TRAJECTORIES. THIS DOES NOT MEAN, THOUGH, THAT 1989 HAS NOT HAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC IMAGINARY AND STRUCTURES EMERGING IN THE NEW DEMOCRACIES. DISSIDENCE HAS HAD IMPORTANT EVEN IF LESS VISIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRATIC IMAGINARY AND STRUCTURE IN WAYS THAT ARE STILL BEING PLAYED OUT. IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE EVENTS OF 1989 AND DISSIDENT THOUGHT ALSO INDICATED ALTERNATIVE, REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC MODELS THAT HAVE HAD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES EMERGING IN THE WAKE OF 1989. IN THE CONTRIBUTION, THE AUTHOR WILL FIRST BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE ONE-SIDEDNESS OF INTERPRETATIONS OF DEMOCRACY IN POST-1989 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, HIGHLIGHT ONE ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY THAT HAS EMERGED IN SOME OF THE DISSIDENTS' IDEAS PRIOR TO AND IN 1989, IN PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF NOTIONS OF REPUBLICAN DEMOCRACY. SECOND, THE AUTHOR WILL DISCUSS SOME INSTANCES-PREDOMINANTLY REFERRING TO THE EXPERIENCES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, HUNGARY, AND POLAND-IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF DISSIDENT IDEAS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS, IN PARTICULAR REGARDING LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND DIRECT DEMOCRACY, BECOMES VISIBLE.
337	DURING THE SUMMER OF 2007, NAHR EL-BARED REFUGEE CAMP IN NORTHERN LEBANON WAS THE SCENE OF A FIERCE BATTLE BETWEEN THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES AND A MILITANT ISLAMIST GROUP CALLED FATEH AL-ISLAM. WHEN PALESTINIAN EVACUEES RETURNED AFTER THE CONFLICT, THEY FOUND NAHR EL-BARED UTTERLY DESTROYED, HOUSES SMASHED FIRST BY SHELLS AND BOMBS, THEN BY VANDALISM AND ARSON, POSSESSIONS STOLEN AND BROKEN, OFFENSIVE GRAFFITI DAUBED OIL WALLS. I ARGUE IN THIS PAPER THAT THE BATTLE OF NAHR EL-BARED, AND PARTICULARLY THE MONTH OF LOOTING AND ARSON THAT FOLLOWED THE BATTLE, WAS A CASE OF URBICIDE IN A SPACE OF EXCEPTION. THE SEEMINGLY UNRESTRICTED DESTRUCTION OF HOMES, THE THEFT OF POSSESSIONS AND ARSON, WENT BEYOND ANY POSSIBLE MILITARY NECESSITY AND BECAME THE DELIBERATE AND SYSTEMATIC ERASURE OF THE CAMP. THIS URBICIDE WAS MADE MORE POSSIBLE BY THE VERY NATURE OF THE POLITICAL SPACES OF THE CAMP, WHICH ARE IN LEBANON BUT NOT OF LEBANON, IN WHICH LEBANESE SOVEREIGNTY AND LAW ARE NOT FULLY ENFORCED, IN WHICH A WHOLE RANGE OF NON-LEBANESE ACTORS EXERCISE POLITICAL POWER OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE LEBANESE STATE. IN THESE SPACES OF EXCEPTION ILL WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS SUSPENDED, THE LOOTING, ARSON AND VANDALISM TOOK PLACE WITHOUT SANCTION. PALESTINIAN HOMES AND LIVES HAD BECOME SACRED IN THE SENSE THAT THEY COULD BE DESTROYED WITHOUT SANCTION, WITHOUT RECOURSE TO LEGAL REDRESS, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO LAW. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER LTD.

338	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF BANK OWNERSHIP AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE BANKING SECTOR FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR A SAMPLE OF 76 BANKS IN THE GCC MARKETS. WE USED THE GMM ESTIMATOR AND MERTON'S DD AND PD AS OUR MAIN DEPENDENT VARIABLES ON ANNUAL DATA OF 14 YEARS IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE ANALYSIS SUB-SAMPLED CONSIDERING PRIVATE VS STATE, DOMESTIC VS FOREIGN OWNED, ISLAMIC VS CONVENTIONAL AND SMALL VS LARGE VS ALL BANKS IN THE GCC MARKETS. WE FOUND ALL STATE-OWNED BANKS TO BE MORE STABLE THAN PRIVATELY-OWNED BANKS. HOWEVER, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR SIZE THIS FINDING IS TRUE FOR SMALL BUT NOT LARGE STATE-OWNED BANKS. THIS MEANS AS STATE-OWNED BANKS GROW IN SIZE, THEY APPEAR TO LOSE THEIR PREVIOUSLY HELD STABILITY ADVANTAGE AND PRIVATISATION MIGHT BE PONDERED TO PRESERVE THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY. WE ALSO FOUND, IN LINE WITH THE GLOBAL ADVANTAGE HYPOTHESIS, THAT FOREIGN-OWNED BANKS TO BE MORE STABLE AND HAVE A LOWER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN THE DOMESTICALLY- OWNED BANKS. IN ADDITION, EVEN THOUGH OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE ISLAMIC BANKING MODEL DID NOT CHANGE THE STABILITY LEVEL, ISLAMIC BANKS WERE FOUND TO REGISTER A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT THAN THEIR CONVENTIONAL COUNTERPARTS. FINALLY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW VARIABLE, THE OTHER THREE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES WERE FOUND TO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY THE GCC BANKING SECTOR.
339	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ADD TO THE RECENT SCHOLARLY SEARCH FOR AFRICAN LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY TO IMPROVE LEADERSHIP EFFECTIVENESS IN AFRICA. IT EXAMINES THE OROMO GADA SYSTEM'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES AND ARGUES ITS RELEVANCE TO THE CURRENT AND FUTURE LEADERSHIP EFFECTIVENESS IN OROMIA, ETHIOPIA, AND AFRICA. IT ANALYSES THE LITERATURE ON THE HISTORY, CULTURE, AND CURRENT PRACTICES OF THE GADA SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY ITS LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHIES. IT DISCUSSES THESE PRINCIPLES BY COMPARING WITH UBUNTU AND OTHER INDIGENOUS AFRICAN LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHIES ON THE ONE HAND WITH UN PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ON THE OTHER. EVIDENCES SHOW THAT IN SPITE OF THE EXPANSION OF MODERN EDUCATION AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING; THERE ARE LITTLE OR NO EVIDENCE OF LEADERSHIP EFFECTIVENESS IN AFRICA. CORRUPTION, POVERTY, INJUSTICE, AND LACK OF LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE CONTINUED TO BE THE IMAGES OF AFRICA AND ITS LEADERSHIP. THESE LEADERSHIP FAILURES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO LACK OF LEADERSHIP THAT CONNECTS WITH THE SOCIETAL VALUES AND CULTURES. THE ADOPTION OF GADA LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY, EQUALITY, MORALITY, RULE OF LAW, PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT OF CITIZENS, DECISION MAKING BY CONSENSUS, SEPARATION OF POWER AND CHECK AND BALANCE, DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE, FIXED TERMS OFFICE AND PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND IMPEACHMENT OF ELECTED LEADERS, HONESTY, TEAM LEADERSHIP AND CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION IN POLITICAL, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATION LEADERSHIP ARE DISCUSSED. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF GADA, UBUNTU, AND OTHER INDIGENOUS LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHIES IS RECOMMENDED AS A REMEDY TO AFRICA'S LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS.
340	SINCE 2011, PROTESTS IN POST-COMMUNIST ROMANIA HAVE CHANGED THEIR GOALS. PROTESTERS CLAIM TO GUARD FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF DEMOCRACY SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND FAIR REPRESENTATION AND TO RISE AGAINST INSTITUTIONS CRIPPLED BY CORRUPTION. IN SIMILAR FASHION TO THE 1989 REVOLUTION AND THE EARLY 1990S PROTESTS, STUDENTS HAVE ASSUMED AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THESE EVENTS. THEY TOOK TO THE STREETS IN BUCHAREST, CLUJ, IASI AND TIMISOARA, THE COUNTRY'S FOUR LARGEST CITIES, AND ELSEWHERE. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, SOCIAL MEDIA HAS PROVEN ESSENTIAL FOR THE GATHERING OF INFORMATION, FOR COORDINATING COLLECTIVE ACTION AND EXPRESSING THE YOUNG PROTESTERS' IDENTITY. YET RECENT RESEARCH (BADESCU AND SUM 2018) CANVASSES A GLOOMY PICTURE OF ROMANIAN YOUTH, SAID TO HAVE AN ERODED DEMOCRATIC PROFILE. THIS SITUATION IS NOT UNIQUE. IN HUNGARY, AGE AND THE DISPLAY OF AUTHORITARIAN ATTITUDES ARE INVERSELY RELATED, UNLIKE IN POLAND (FESNIC 2015). EASTERN EUROPEANS MIGHT HAVE FINALLY REJECTED THE REMNANTS OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME, YET THE NEW GENERATION IS EAGER TO EMBRACE VALUES THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY DEMOCRATIC. VALUE CHANGE TRENDS BRING OUT NEW INTERPRETATIONS TO THE WAY THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY UNFOLDS IN EASTERN EUROPE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THIS CONTRAST BY DISCOVERING THE COMBINATION OF ATTITUDES THAT DRIVES YOUTH TO PROTEST. WITH THE HELP OF A STUDENT SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2017, IT IS SHOWN THAT PROTEST ENGAGEMENT IS POSITIVELY LINKED TO THE PRO-DEMOCRATIC AND DIVERSITY-EMBRACING ATTITUDES OF STUDENTS.
341	THIS ARTICLE USES IMAGES OF POLICING PRODUCED IN THE CONTEXT OF TAIWAN'S SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT TO EXPLORE THE PLACE OF POLICE IN DEMOCRACY. I DISTINGUISH FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS THE POLICE SOCIETY RELATIONSHIP CAME TO BE REPRESENTED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS MOVEMENT. I ARGUE THAT THESE IMAGES OF POLICE WERE PERFORMATIVE: THEY HAD REAL EFFECTS ON THE TRAJECTORY OF THE EVENT. TO UNDERSTAND THESE EFFECTS, I USE A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WHICH LINKS THE RISE OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES TO A SHIFT IN THE CULTURAL DIMENSION OF STATE FORMATION. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE DRIVING FORCE OF TAIWAN'S SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT APPEARS AS A SYMBOLIC DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN TWO CONTRADICTORY IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY. ON THE ONE HAND IS A RADICAL IDEAL, IN WHICH A CONSTITUENT POWER IS FOUNDED DIRECTLY IN THE MEANINGFUL PROCESSES OF PUBLIC WILL FORMATION. ON THE OTHER HAND IS A LIBERAL IDEAL, IN WHICH THE RELATIVE AUTONOMY OF A CONSTITUTED STATE IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT CIVIL ORDER AGAINST POLITICAL CHAOS. THE POLICE ARE SITUATED AT A POINT OF MATERIAL CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THESE RADICAL AND LIBERAL IMAGINARIES. TO THE DEGREE THAT POLICE POWERS ARE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, THEY ARE FOUNDED IN THE LIBERAL IDEAL, WHICH MAKES THEM VULNERABLE TO THE "IMAGEFARE" TACTICS OF RADICAL-DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL MOVEMENTS. "WHEN CONSENT TO BE POLICED IS COMPLETELY LACKING, [WHEN] THERE IS NO MORE CONSENSUAL BASIS ON WHICH THE POLICE CAN STAND, IT IS POLICING ITSELF WHICH IS IN JEOPARDY".(1)
342	THE ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE INTRA LABOUR LAW HISTORY, BECAUSE THIS IS A LAW FOR DISTRIBUTION THAT ALSO AFFECTS TO THE PRODUCTION (RIGHT OF PRODUCTION AND ITS ORGANIZATION). AFTER SUCCESSIVE LABOUR REFORMS, IT IS CONFIGURED AS A "SCATTER" LABOUR LAW WHERE EMERGENCY, "OMNIBUS", ETC. LAWS AND ALSO PRACTICES OF SELECTIVE DEREGULATION HAVE PROLIFERATED, AFFECTING THE "RE-MERCANTILIZATION" OF FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS. IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, THIS EVOLUTION RAISES PROBLEMS OF TECHNICAL AND LEGAL POLICY OF SOCIAL LAW. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THE LOSS OF UNITY AND COHERENCE IN THE POLICY (ESPECIALLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE), THE TECHNICAL FRAGMENTATION OF SOCIAL AND LEGAL LAWS (WITH THE LOSS OF VALUE IN BOTH FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIAL SENSE), AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTY. A SORT OF STRONG PUBLIC INTERVENTIONISM EMERGES AND IT IS IMPOSED IN SPACES OF COLLECTIVE AUTONOMY AS IT WOULD BE A "NOT INCONSISTENT STATE LAW" WHICH IS MORE UNILATERAL IN ITS ENDS (PREFERABLY FACED TO THE SATISFACTION OF BUSINESS INTERESTS, UNDER THE CLAIM OF MAGICAL FORMULAS, AND LARGELY ELUSIVE MEASURE OF ENFORCING PRODUCTIVITY, PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS; IN SHORT, THERE IS A PREFERENTIAL PROTECTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE). BY CONTRAST, IN THE CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE SOCIAL STATE, LABOUR LAW HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CONTRADICTORY LAW, OF SOCIAL COMMITMENT AND POLITICAL PACT, AND HAS ALWAYS TRIED TO RECONCILE THE PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND PROTECTION OF THE WORKING CLASSES (FORMING PART OF THE POLITICAL PACT, WHOSE ORIGIN IS AT THE RULE OF LAW).
343	FACED WITH INSTITUTIONAL COMPETITION, ACCELERATED BY THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION, COUNTRIES HAVE BASICALLY TWO OPTIONS: PARTICIPATE IN IT AND GET THEIR BENEFITS OR ISOLATE THEMSELVES AND BE LEFT ASIDE. WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS, LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COPE WITH COMPETITION AND ARE LAGGING BEHIND. IN THIS ARTICLE AN ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF LATIN AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS OF MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH THE BUILDING OF A COMPOSITE INDEX CALLED "INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDEX", AVERAGING TOGETHER INDEXES EVALUATING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES, TRYING TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE ALLOWED COUNTRIES TO PROGRESS AND SHOWING WHETHER LATIN AMERICA'S INSTITUTIONS ARE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE WORLD ARENA. IT WILL BE CONCLUDED THAT SMALL COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CHILE AND SOME ISLANDS ON THE CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AMERICA, GET BETTER QUALIFICATIONS THAN LARGER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THEIR SIZE FORCES THEM TO BE OPEN ECONOMIES WHERE CONTRACTS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE ENFORCED, SINCE THEIR ECONOMIES WOULD NOT BE SELF-SUSTAINABLE IF CLOSED. ALSO, THE "HERITAGE" OF LEGAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE BRITISH "COMMON LAW" SHOWS THAT SOME COUNTRIES COULD GET A BETTER PERFORMANCE OF JUSTICE AS SHOWN BY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE HIGH QUALIFICATIONS OF SOME CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES AS COMPARED TO OTHERS IN LATIN AMERICA THAT INHERITED THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF SPAIN OR PORTUGAL. A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOLLOW.
344	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BROUGHT A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND HAS INFLUENCED THE MODERN CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABILITY AS PROJECTED INTO THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) AND THE UNDERLYING MULTI-STAKEHOLDER MODEL. THE NEW GENERATION OF CONSUMERS, GENERATION Z, HAS PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE MARKET AND ITS SHOPPING TRENDS HAVE BEEN IMPACTING THE ENTIRE CSR SCENERY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDES, CONSUMPTION PREFERENCES AND EXPECTATIONS. IN SPRING 2021, THIS INDUCED A PIONEERING CASE STUDY SURVEY INVOLVING MEMBERS OF GENERATION Z, STUDENTS FROM A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE, FOCUSING ON THEIR (LACK OF) READINESS TO PAY ANY "CSR BONUS". THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCH AIM WAS TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE RATHER SURPRISING UNWILLINGNESS OF A SOLVENT PART OF THE NEW GENERATION OF CONSUMERS TO SUPPORT CSR DURING THE COVID-19 ERA BY PAYING AT LEAST A SYMBOLIC CSR BONUS. A FORMAL SURVEY INVOLVING A QUESTIONNAIRE, REPLIED TO BY 228 STUDENTS, OUT OF WHICH 18 TOTALLY REJECTED THE CSR BONUS, WAS ASSESSED VIA CONTINGENCY TABLES. IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPLEMENTARY QUESTIONING VIA AN INFORMAL INTERVIEW AND GLOSSING. THIS PLETHORA OF DATA WAS PROCESSED BY META-ANALYSIS AND LEAD TO AN UNEXPECTED PROPOSITION: PRIMA FACIE SUSTAINABILITY HERETICS DENYING TO PAY ANY CSR BONUS CAN BE CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS AND RESPONSIBLE AND PROGRESSIVE SUPPORTERS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR. THEIR REJECTION IS A DEONTOLOGICAL CRY IN A DESERT FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY, TRUST AND THE RULE OF LAW.
345	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF CAPITALIST, SOCIALIST CENTRALLY PLANNED, AND SOCIALIST MARKET SYSTEMS, AND THE NEWER CLASSIFICATION OF VARIANTS OF CAPITALISM INTO THE ANGLO-SAXON, EUROPEAN CONTINENTAL, AND ASIAN MODELS, ARE INADEQUATE TO EXPLAIN NEW PHENOMENA IN A GLOBALIZED ECONOMY. AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF CENTRAL PLANNING, COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION BECAME A CATEGORY DESCRIBING PROCESSES OF DEEP SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. THESE TRANSITION COUNTRIES ASPIRED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF DEVELOPED EUROPEAN MARKET ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS GOVERNANCE STANDARDS REGARDING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS BY BALCEROWICZ (2014) COMBINES THE TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WELL-GOVERNED DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH A MATRIX THAT SHOWS THE INTERACTION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND GOVERNANCE OUTCOMES.THIS PAPER BUILDS ON BALCEROWICZ'S CLASSIFICATION BY INTRODUCING AND DELINEATING THE CATEGORIES OF STATE CAPITALISM, CRONY CAPITALISM, AND STATE CAPTURE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A NEW CLASSIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. IT USES THESE CONCEPTS TO EMPIRICALLY ANALYZE THE TRANSITION COUNTRIES, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO STATES ASPIRING TO EU MEMBERSHIP AND THE NEW EU MEMBER STATES. THE METHODOLOGY USED IS ANALYTICAL AND EMPIRICAL. THE RESULTS FIND THAT THE TRANSITION IS INCOMPLETE, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF GOVERNANCE, LEADING TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF A 'MID-TRANSITION TRAP', SIMILAR TO THE MUCH DISCUSSED 'MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP'. THE RESULTS SHOULD LEAD TO FURTHER, MORE REFINED RESEARCH.
346	THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPED IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALISATION ARE FURTHER MORE COMPLEX THAT THOSE ARISEN WITHIN THE RULE-OF-LAW OF THE NATION-STATES. THE LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IMPOSE INTO THESE SOCIAL SYSTEMS DIFFERENT FORCE FIELDS DETERMINING THE SPACE OF POSSIBILITIES IN WHICH THEY EVOLVE. IN THIS SITUATION, THE DECISION-MAKING IS CORRESPONDINGLY FURTHER MORE COMPLEX AS TO DRIVE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION FROM THE ROOT-LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, ALL THE WAY THROUGH UNTIL THE GLOBAL SYSTEM. EPARTICIPATION REPRESENTS A POSSIBILITY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE DETERMINED BY THE MEMBER PERCEPTIONS OF PARTAKING IN RELEVANT DECISIONS. A PARADIGMATIC EXAMPLE OF THESE GLOBALISED SOCIAL STRUCTURES IS THE EUROPEAN HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM, IN WHICH VERY WELL DEFINED LOCAL AND NATIONAL STRUCTURES COEXIST WITH A NORMATIVE FIELD OF GLOBALISED RELATIONS. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2013 AN EPARTICIPATION SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED UNDER EU SUPPORT INVOLVING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES FROM EUROPE AND ABROAD. A FLEXIBLE APPROACH WAS USED TO ADAPT THE SYSTEM TO THE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, WHEREAS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK WAS SET UP TO EVALUATE THE EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO FIND GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE EPARTICIPATION DEVELOPMENTS. THE SOCIO-TECHNICAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS AND THE CORRESPONDING RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED AIMING TO PROPOSE A NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR EPARTICIPATION. THIS SOLUTION TARGETS THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY UNIVERSITY IN WHICH THE CROSSROADS OF LEARNING ANALYTICS, EADMINISTRATION AND EPARTICIPATION ARE DEEPLY RE-STRUCTURING THE ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT.

347	IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO REVIEW LEGISLATION FOR UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, CAN A COURT REVIEW THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR PROCESSES OF THE LEGISLATURE? IN OTHER WORDS, CAN THE COURT INTERVENE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE LEGISLATURE, OR IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN MEMBERS AND OFFICIALS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION? ASSUMING THAT THE COURT CAN INTERVENE, THEN, ON WHAT GROUND(S) CAN SUCH INTERVENTION TAKE PLACE? THE RECENT SPLIT DECISION BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN MAZIBUKO V SISULU, SPEAKER OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 2013 6 SA 249 (CC) AFFIRMS TWO APPROACHES: THE TRADITIONAL COMMON-LAW, NONINTERVENTIONIST APPROACH EPITOMISED BY THE MINORITY JUDGMENT, AND THE MODERN SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONAL-INTERPRETATION APPROACH REPRESENTED BY THE JUDGMENT OF THE MAJORITY. THE QUESTION COMMON TO BOTH APPROACHES, HOWEVER, IS WHETHER THE CONDUCT OF THE FUNCTIONARIES OF THE ASSEMBLY VIOLATED A MEMBER'S RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND DEBATE IN THE ASSEMBLY. THIS QUESTION IS INVESTIGATED ALONGSIDE THOSE INSTANCES WHERE PARLIAMENTARY BILLS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED FOR CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE CONCLUSION INEVITABLY IS THAT THE COMMON-LAW, NON-INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH TO THE PRIVILEGES OF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT APPLY UNCONDITIONALLY IN THE MODERN SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONAL STATE WHERE THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES OTHERWISE; CONDUCT OF THE SPEAKER OR ANY OTHER OFFICIAL OF THE LEGISLATURE VIOLATES INDIVIDUAL OR MINORITY MEMBERS' RIGHTS; OR WHERE THE RULES OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE DEFECTIVE AND, THEREFORE, INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION.
348	TRANSJURISDICTIONAL WATER POLLUTION IS A MAJOR TECHNICAL AND LEGAL PROBLEM FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND ARISES FROM THE MANY PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR WATER RESOURCES AND FOR WATER ENVIRONMENT, PLANNING, AND MANAGEMENT. THE LAW FOR POLLUTION AND THE WATER LAW MUST BE SEEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT TRANSITION IN CHINA FROM THE TRADITIONAL "RULE BY LAW" TO "RULE OF LAW." NEVERTHELESS, THE COMMON VIEW IN CHINA IS THAT EACH LAW GIVES IF "POWER" TO THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ADMINISTRATION (SEPA) FOR POLLUTION AND THE MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES (MWR) FOR WATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT. THE ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK IS DESCRIBED, AND THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS HIGHLIGHTED AS A MAJOR REASON FOR FAILURES IN ENFORCING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. RIVER BASIN ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LITTLE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER EXCEPT FOR FLOOD EMERGENCIES AND ARE NOT MANDATED TO MANAGE RIVER BASINS IN A HOLISTIC CONTEXT. WE OUTLINE A VARIETY OF DEFICIENCIES AND RECOMMEND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN THE WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (WPPC) LAW. THESE INCLUDE SUCH ISSUES AS A LACK OF DEFINITION OF TERMINOLOGY, AN INADEQUATE DEFINITION OF POLLUTION, A LACK OF TRANS-BOUNDARY WATER QUALITY STANDARDS, PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSPARENCY, ACCESS TO DATA AND INFORMATION, AND SEVERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT CAUSE FRICTION BETWEEN THE TWO MINISTRIES. AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, THERE IS NEED FOR A PERMANENT INTER-MINISTERIAL COORDINATION ARRANGEMENT TO DEAL WITH THE HARMONIZATION OF LAWS, INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND OPERATIONAL PRACTICES BETWEEN SEPA AND MWR.
349	TEXTUALISM PROMISES SIMPLICITY AND OBJECTIVITY: FOCUS ON THE TEXT, THE WHOLE TEXT, AND NOTHING BUT THE TEXT. BUT THE NEWEST VERSION OF TEXTUALISM IS NOT SO SIMPLE. NOW THAT TEXTUALISM IS THE SUPREME COURT'S DOMINANT INTERPRETIVE THEORY, MOST INTERPRETIVE DISPUTES IMPLICATE TEXTUALISM, AND ITS INHERENT COMPLEXITIES HAVE SURFACED. THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO DOCUMENT THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF DOCTRINAL AND THEORETICAL CHOICES THAT REGULARLY DIVIDE MODERN TEXTUALISTS AND FOR WHICH THEIR THEORY CURRENTLY PROVIDES NO CLEAR ANSWERS. INDEED, AS PRACTICED BY THE JUSTICES, THE NEWEST TEXTUALISM UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS ITS THEORETICAL FOUNDATION.AS WE DEMONSTRATE, THERE ARE AT LEAST TWELVE CATEGORIES OF ANALYTICAL CHOICES FACED BY TEXTUALISTS IN THE HARD CASES THAT DOMINATE THE SUPREME COURT'S DOCKET AND ACADEMIC DISCOURSE. AT PRESENT, THE NEW TEXTUALIST COURT IS RIVEN WITH INTERNAL DIVISIONS AND SENDS LESS-THAN-CLEAR MESSAGES TO THE LOWER COURTS. AND THE OBJECTIVE, TEXT-BASED EVIDENCE THE JUSTICES CLAIM TO APPLY DOES NOT CONSTRAIN THE COURT'S RESULTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT TEXTUALISTS MUST BETTER DEFINE THEIR METHODOLOGY AND SHOULD JETTISON THE MOST ACTIVIST OR IDIOSYNCRATIC DOCTRINES THAT HAVE BECOME PROMINENT IN ROBERTS COURT LEGISPRUDENCE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME BEST PRACTICES THAT WOULD BUILD ON THE COURT'S TEXT-CENTRIC FOCUS BUT RENDER THAT FOCUS BETTER SUITED TO THE COURT'S PROPER ROLE AS A NEUTRAL PARTNER TO CONGRESS IN ELABORATING STATUTORY SCHEMES.
350	LAW AS A SPECIAL SOCIAL REGULATION TOOL IN MODERN CONDITIONS ACQUIRES A UNIVERSAL CHARACTER. FOR ITS COMPREHENSIVE STUDY, AS WELL AS FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN PUBLIC LIFE, A SPECIAL COGNITIVE APPARATUS IS REQUIRED. CONSEQUENTLY, BOTH IN THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TERMS, IT IS ABOUT LEGAL THINKING, WHICH IS IN THE FOCUS OF DOCTRINE AS A SPECIAL FORM OF MENTAL ACTIVITY. TO SOLVE SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STUDY, IT IS ADVISABLE TO INTRODUCE THE CATEGORY OF "COGNITIVE BASIS OF LAW AND ORDER" INTO SCIENCE. THIS KIND OF INNOVATION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DISCLOSE A MECHANISM FOR ENSURING TRUST IN SOCIETY, WITHOUT WHICH THE ENTIRE APPARATUS OF LEGAL COERCION IS REDUCED TO HAPHAZARD VIOLENCE AND, AS A RESULT, BECOMES MEANINGLESS. THIS MECHANISM INCLUDES INTELLECTUAL AND VOLITIONAL COMPONENTS. THE FORMER IS THE DOMINANT COMPONENT, AS IT IS REPRESENTED BY THE "COGNITIVE APPARATUS OF LAW". IT IS THIS COMPONENT WHICH DETERMINES THE ENTIRE "CONTENT OF LAW", WHILE ENSURING ITS CONSISTENCY, INDEPENDENCE AND COMPLETENESS. THE INCLUSION OF THE VOLITIONAL COMPONENT IN THE COGNITIVE BASIS OF LAW AND ORDER IS EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT IT IS THROUGH THIS COMPONENT THE INTELLECT IS REALIZED. WITHOUT AN ACT OF EXTERNAL EXPRESSION OF WILL NONE OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY IN THE FIELD OF LAW CAN ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. THE COGNITIVE BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS NORMATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS - ENSURES THE FUNCTIONING OF LAW, WHILE DEFINING ITS EXISTENCE.
351	THE FORMATION OF PHYSICAL CAPITAL IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) IN AGRICULTURE IS IMPERATIVE TO HELP THE CONTINENT (1) OVERCOME THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON FOOD INSECURITY AND (2) STILL BE ON TRACK TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) OF "NO POVERTY" AND "ZERO HUNGER" IN THE MIDST OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. USING COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA ON 40 SSA COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2014 AND RAINFALL DEVIATIONS AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ODA) IN FIXED-EFFECT ESTIMATION SETTINGS, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE `INSTANTANEOUS' IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL ODA ON AGRICULTURAL FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION IN SSA. THE QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER AID TO AGRICULTURE DOES TRANSLATE INSTANTANEOUSLY TO BUILDING FIXED CAPITAL URGENTLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE EFFECT OF ANY POTENTIAL CRISIS ON FOOD INSECURITY. MEASURING AGRICULTURAL FIXED CAPITAL AS FIXED INVESTMENTS IN FARM MACHINERY, DAMS, INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS FOR AGRICULTURAL AND AGRO-PROCESSING, FENCES, DITCHES, DRAINS, ETC., WE FIND THAT CAPITAL FORMATION IN SSA AGRICULTURE IMPROVES INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH AGRICULTURAL ODA INFLOWS. SECOND, WE FIND THAT EVEN THOUGH RAINFALL DEVIATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL ODA INFLOWS TO SSA, INSTITUTIONS PARTICULARLY THOSE DESIGNED TO CONTROL CORRUPTION AND STRENGTHEN RULE OF LAW, DO MATTER FOR AGRICULTURAL AID INFLOWS TO SSA. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AGRICULTURAL ODA IS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENTS AND ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON THE SPECIFICATION OF THE INSTANTANEOUS MODEL.
352	LEADERSHIP INADEQUACY IN NIGERIA HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RISE IN CORRUPTION, WHICH HAS UNDERMINED HUMAN DIGNITY THROUGH INSUFFICIENT PROVISION OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS. THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP VENERATES SELF-INTEREST TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT ENHANCING HUMAN WELLBEING IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPORTANT. TO SAVE NIGERIANS FROM THIS DILEMMA, THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR A NEW LEADERSHIP ETHICS CALLED 'RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP', WHOSE PRECEPTS PROTECT AND ENHANCE HUMAN DIGNITY AND ENFORCE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW TO CURB THE SPREAD OF CORRUPTION. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT BY SURVEYING THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE WITH ITS FAILURES AND HOW IT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO HUMAN DIGNITY VIOLATIONS. IT WAS FOUND THAT POOR LEADERSHIP WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTINUOUS SPREAD OF CORRUPTION AND EXPOSURE OF HUMAN DIGNITY TO VIOLATIONS THROUGH POROUS AND INADEQUATE PROVISIONS OF BASIC HUMAN NEEDS. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY CONCLUDED THAT NEW LEADERSHIP ETHICS, WHICH ARE INCLUSIVE AND INTEGRATIVE, WOULD APPRECIATE AND RECOGNISE THE INTRINSIC WORTH OF EVERY HUMAN BEING, TAKE ITS PEOPLE FROM THEIR PRESENT POSITION TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE, AND WOULD REDUCE VIOLATION OF HUMAN DIGNITY PURPORTED THROUGH CORRUPTION. CONTRIBUTION: THE ARTICLE ARGUED FOR A NEW ETHOS OF LEADERSHIP THAT IS RESPONSIBLE IN NATURE, ENCOMPASSING, AND INTENTIONALLY PEOPLE-CENTRED, WHICH TAKES PEOPLE FROM WHERE THEY ARE TO WHERE THEY OUGHT TO BE. IT FITS INTO THE SCOPE OF THE JOURNAL BY WAY OF INTER-CONNECTING DIFFERENT TOPICS TO PRODUCE A UNIFYING IDEA.
353	THERE IS AN IMPERCEPTIBLE LAXITY IN LITERATURE IN FINDING SOCIO ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL BY INTEGRATING ROLE OF RELIGION. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL SURVEYS DATA ON RELIGIOSITY CONCENTRATING ON RELIGIOUS BELIEF AND PRACTICES, REVEAL THE RELIGION DEPENDENT BEHAVIORS OF INDIVIDUALS OF A SOCIETY. THEREFORE, WE INCLUDE TRUST I.E., SOCIAL CAPITAL AS A PRODUCT OF RELIGIOUS SECTOR INSTIGATING FROM INDIVIDUAL TOWARDS COMMUNITY AND STATE, NAMED IT AS RELIGION DEPENDENT SOCIAL CAPITAL (RDSC). THIS STUDY PROPOSES A MODEL TO INVESTIGATE RELATION OF RDSC WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH BASED ON SOME KEY PROPOSITIONS: RDSC IS LINKED WITH FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND RULE OF LAW PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT. (A) IF INDIVIDUALS OF THE SOCIETY HAVE HIGH FRACTION OF BELIEFS B ALONG WITH OPTIMUM PRACTICING WITH LEVEL OF TRUST T IN THE PERIOD T, THEN THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE PERIOD T ARE ACHIEVED. (B) DISEQUILIBRIUM IN AMOUNT OF BELIEF AND PRACTICE LEAD TO DELAYED CONVERGENCE IN ACHIEVING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES. THESE PROPOSITIONS ARE VALIDATED BY EMPLOYING MARKOV PROCESS. USA BEING A RELIGIOUS ECONOMY ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE IN FEWER ITERATIONS SHOWING A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF RDSC ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. CONTRARY WITH THAT CHINA LACKING IN RDSC ACHIEVE CONVERGENCE AFTER 5 TIMES MORE ITERATION THAN USA. ACCORDINGLY, THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF RDSC ARE MORE VISIBLE IN A RELIGIOUS ECONOMY AS COMPARED TO NON-RELIGIOUS ECONOMY. A POLICY IMPLICATIONS REGARDING IMPROVEMENT IN REDUCING CONVERGENCE PERIOD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR A SOCIETY HAVING LOWEST LEVEL OF RELIGIOSITY ARE ALSO SUGGESTED.
354	THE LEGACY OF SYSTEMATIC HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED DURING 1999 VIOLENT CONFLICT AND THE PREVIOUS REPRESSIVE RULE STILL IMPACT THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF KOSOVO CITIZENS. THAT IS WHY TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES ARE A NECESSARY COMPONENT IN KOSOVO'S STATE BUILDING EFFORTS. WITH THE END OF THE 1999 CONFLICT, KOSOVO HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED BY THE UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN KOSOVO (UNMIK) AND ALSO SUPPORTED BY EUROPEAN UNION (EU) PRESENCES: THE EU SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE IN KOSOVO, AND EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION KNOWN AS EULEX. IN THE COURSE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR MANDATES TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES WERE NOT A PRIORITY FOR UNMIK AND EU PRESENCES. WITH THE SIGNING OF THE STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (SAA) THE EU MADE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PART OF THE KOSOVO ACCESSION DEMANDS. IN DECEMBER 2015, THE GOVERNMENT OF KOSOVO APPROVED ITS NATIONAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STABILIZATION AND ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (NAPISAA). THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SAA, INCLUDED WITHIN THE NAPISAA OBLIGE KOSOVO GOVERNMENT TO APPROVE A NATIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE STRATEGY. THIS PAPER ANALYSES EU PEACE AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING SUPPORT AND THEIR IMPACT IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES IN KOSOVO. THROUGH ANALYSING THE MANDATE AND ACTIONS ON THE GROUND IT DRAWS CONCLUSIONS IF EU IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESS IN KOSOVO OR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE POLICIES ARE PROMOTED BY EU ONLY AS PART OF ITS ENLARGEMENT STRATEGY. FINALLY, THE PAPER GIVES RECOMMENDATIONS AS A BASIS FOR FUTURE ELABORATION OF AN EU APPROACH TO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
355	OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, INTERNATIONAL ACTORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DIFFUSE REPERTOIRES OF CONTENTIOUS PRACTICES, INCLUDING RIGHTS-BASED LITIGATION, TO CHINA. MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS, FOUNDATIONS, AND INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (INGOS) HAVE USED FUNDING AND TRAINING PROGRAMS CONDUCTED IN CHINA AND AT LAW SCHOOLS ABROAD IN ORDER TO RAISE THE CAPACITY OF CHINESE ATTORNEYS, NGOS, JUDGES, AND LEGAL OFFICIALS TO IMPROVE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN PARTICULAR, INTERNATIONAL ACTORS HAVE WORKED WITH CHINESE NGOS AND STATE OFFICIALS TO FOUND LEGAL AID CENTERS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ADVOCACY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF POLLUTION VICTIMS AND AIDS CARRIERS. LEGAL AID CENTERS, ATTORNEYS, AND THEIR FINANCIAL BACKERS SEEK TO BRING FORWARD 'IMPACT LITIGATION' CASES IN THE COURTS TO ESTABLISH MODEL DECISIONS FOR OTHER PLAINTIFFS, ATTORNEYS, AND JUDGES TO FOLLOW. TO DATE, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE ENJOYED MORE SUCCESS GAINING ACCESS TO THE COURTS AND IN RECEIVING FAVORABLE COURT JUDGMENTS THAN HAVE AIDS GROUPS. IN MANY CASES INVOLVING AIDS VICTIMS, ATTORNEYS AND LEGAL AID CENTERS SEEK COMPENSATION THROUGH ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHODS RATHER THAN LITIGATION, WHICH DO NOT ESTABLISH A LEGAL PRECEDENT. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE REASONS FOR THE DIVERGENT OUTCOMES OF EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF POLLUTION VICTIMS AND AIDS CARRIERS IN THE COURTS. PRIMARILY, THE INSTITUTIONAL PARTICULARITIES AND CONTEXTS OF THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAVE ALLOWED INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO TAKE DEEPER ROOT THAN THOSE RELATED TO AIDS.
356	WHEREAS THE CONCEPT OF "SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW" PUNCTUATED POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THE LATE 1990S, THE IDEA OF A "SOCIALIST HARMONIOUS SOCIETY" IS TODAY CASTING A STRANGE LIGHT ON CHINESE LEGAL REFORM. IS THERE A CONFUCIAN VISION OF CHINA'S MARKETING LAW AND PRACTICE? TO WHAT EXTENT HAVE CHINA'S NORMS FOR MARKETING, MAINLY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ADVERTISING LAW, BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE NEW GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARD A HARMONIOUS SOCIETY? IN THE POST WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION ACCESSION PERIOD, THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE "SOCIALIST HARMONIOUS SOCIETY" HAS TURNED LAW INTO A DISCIPLINARY PRINCIPLE GIVEN OVER TO SOCIETY'S MORAL CONSTRUCTION. IF LAW IS SEEN AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR LEGITIMIZING POWER, IT REMAINS IMPLICITLY BOUND PRIMARILY TO ENSURE THE REGIME'S DURABILITY. ALTHOUGH MORE AND MORE ORDINARY CITIZENS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES ARE SEIZING HOLD OF NORMATIVE TOOLS BEING PUT AT THEIR DISPOSAL, THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT CHINESE LAW IS IMPLEMENTED IN A UNIFORM AND TIMELY MANNER THROUGHOUT CHINA'S TERRITORY. CHINA STILL SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF COHERENCE AND POLITICAL WILL IN THE DRAFTING OF A LEGAL REFORM THAT AIMS MAINLY AT PRESERVING THE CURRENT FRAGILE POLITICAL BALANCE. CONTRADICTORY FORCES ARE INDEED AT WORK IN THIS LEGAL CONSTRUCTION THAT IS TORN BETWEEN LIBERAL LEANINGS AND SOCIALIST AUTHORITARIANISM. WITHOUT A DEEP CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE, ONE CAN EXPECT ONLY RELATIVELY SLOW PROGRESS IN PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE MANY CHINESE AND FOREIGN GOODS AND SERVICES THAT CAN BE FOUND ON THE CHINESE MARKET.
357	CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) IS HAVING A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT ON INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE. THIS STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT REFLECTS CHINA'S RAPID EMERGENCE AS A DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER AND ITS COMPETITION WITH OTHER MAJOR POWERS. IT ALSO REFLECTS CHINA'S CHAMPIONING OF GLOBALIZATION. THE BRI PROGRAM WILL INEVITABLY AFFECT THE EMERGING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW OPERATING IN THE OVER 125 COUNTRIES AND 29 INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE SIGNED UP TO BE PART OF THE BRI. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY LEGAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EMERGING SHAPE OF CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY LAW ON THE MARITIME AND OVERLAND 'SILK ROADS'. SOLVENCY PROBLEMS ARE ALREADY EMERGING AS SERIOUS CONCERNS ARISING OUT OF DEBTS INCURRED THROUGH CHINA'S INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS UNDER THIS INITIATIVE. TO-DATE, ONLY 24 BRI COUNTRIES HAVE TO VARYING DEGREES IMPLEMENTED THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW (UNCITRAL) MODEL LAW ON CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY, CREATING A TENSION BETWEEN TERRITORIAL AND MORE UNIVERSALIST APPROACHES. IN THE SHORT TERM, THESE INSOLVENCY ISSUES ARE LIKELY TO BE DEALT WITH IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, SUCH AS BY RESORTING TO 'SOFT LAW' OR BY USING ADMINISTRATIVE OR POLITICAL MECHANISMS. GIVEN CHINA'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW (WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS), IT IS INEVITABLE THAT EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO GIVE SOME NORMATIVE SHAPE TO THIS NEW GLOBAL SPACE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE THIS EMERGING FRONTIER FOR CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY LAW.
358	CRIMINAL LAW IS BEING BROADENED FROM ITS NORMATIVE AND MORAL RESPONSE TO WRONGDOING TO INCLUDE THE CAPACITY TO ACT AS A PREVENTIVE FORCE. AS WELL AS REACTING TO CRIME THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTEE IT ALSO ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE RISK OF FUTURE CRIME. IN SO DOING, PREVENTIVE CRIMINAL LAW MAKES USE OF HYBRID AND RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION, WHILE REVERSING OR LOWERING BURDENS OF PROOF IF THESE ARE THOUGHT TO UNFAIRLY ADVANTAGE OFFENDERS/DEFENDANTS, RAISING IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. WE ARGUE THAT THIS EMPHASIS ON CONTROLLING RISK WAS THE RESPONSE TO ISSUES OF UNCERTAINTY AND INSECURITY GENERATED BY POST-1970S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESTRUCTURING. WHERE, THOUGH, DO THESE CRIMINAL LAW CHARACTERISTICS OF "RISK SOCIETY" NOW SIT, GIVEN THE CONTEMPORARY RISE OF POPULIST POLITICS? POPULISM PROMISES AN END TO RISK AND ITS ATTENDANT UNCERTAINTIES AND ANXIETIES, BUT IT IS ALREADY EXTENDING RATHER THAN REVERSING THE PREVENTIVE CAPACITY OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS IS BECAUSE POPULISM CONTINUOUSLY NEEDS TO FIND NEW VICTIMS THAT IT EMBRACES AND PLEDGES TO DEFEND AGAINST THEIR ASSAILANTS, LAW-BREAKERS OR OTHERWISE, REAL OR IMAGINED. THE FOCUS OF RISK CONTROL THUS EMBRACES NEW POPULATIONS-REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS, IMMIGRANTS OF ALL KINDS, LEGAL OR OTHERWISE. CONVENTIONS SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS THAT MIGHT PREVIOUSLY HAVE LIMITED SUCH INTERVENTIONS ARE BRUSHED ASIDE AS OUTMODED EXAMPLES OF ELITIST THINKING. INSTEAD, SECURITY IS PRIORITIZED OVER RESIDUAL CONCERNS ABOUT DUE PROCESS, WHILE ALSO PRIORITIZING PUBLIC PROTECTION OVER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.
359	SINCE LATE 2005, THAILAND HAS BEEN MIRED IN A DEEP POLITICAL CRISIS THAT HAS NOW GONE THROUGH TWO COUPS: SEPTEMBER 2006 AND MAY 2014. THE TWO COUPS HAVE REVEALED DEEP AMBIGUITIES IN THE ROLES THAT CIVIL SOCIETY AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY CONSTITUTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, PLAY IN THE POLITY. ALTHOUGH ONE GENERALLY EXPECTS CIVIL SOCIETY AND CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES TO ADDRESS DEMOCRATIC GOALS RELATED TO ENFRANCHISEMENT, ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, WHAT ONE WITNESSES IN THAILAND IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. CIVIL SOCIETY AND CONSTITUTIONAL ACTORS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY PARTISAN INTERESTS RATHER THAN DEMOCRATIC VALUES. IN BOTH THE LEAD-UP TO THE 2006 AND 2014 COUPS, CIVIL SOCIETY FORCES MOBILIZED FORCEFULLY ON THE STREETS OF BANGKOK TO OUST DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED GOVERNMENTS. IN THE PROCESS, THEY PROVIDED THE POLITICAL SPACE AND LEGITIMACY FOR THE MILITARY TO INTERVENE. CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND CONSTITUTIONS HAVE ALSO WORKED TO FURTHER ANTI-DEMOCRATIC ENDS. THE DRAFTING OF THE 2007 CONSTITUTION WAS AN UNEQUIVOCAL EFFORT TO WEAKEN POLITICAL PARTIES AND BRING BACK A LANDSCAPE OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAGMENTATION, WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF PREVENTING THAKSIN SHINAWATRA AND HIS ALLIES FROM RETURNING TO POWER. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS ALSO HANDED DOWN NUMEROUS VERDICTS THAT REFLECT POLITICAL INTERESTS RATHER THAN THE OBJECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, THAILAND'S DEMOCRATIC POLITY RESTS ON QUICKSAND: SOCIAL FORCES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES TO BE DEEPLY AMBIVALENT ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO DEMOCRACY.
360	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES AND COMPARES KANT AND NIETZSCHE AS THINKERS OF THE CONFLICT. IT IS ARGUED IN PARAGRAPH ONE THAT CONFLICT PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE FOR BOTH PHILOSOPHERS IN SEVERAL DOMAINS OF THEIR THOUGHT, AND THAT BOTH OF THEM OFFER US A RICH SET OF INSIGHTS ON THE PRODUCTIVE QUALITIES OF CONFLICT. HOWEVER, KANT IS UNABLE TO FORMULATE A GENUINELY AFFIRMATIVE CONCEPT OF CONFLICT THAT DOES JUSTICE TO THE PRODIGIOUS PRODUCTIVE POWERS DESCRIBED BY HIM. INSTEAD, HE PROMOTES A TERMINATION PHILOSOPHICAL WAR (VERNICHTUNGSKRIEG) AGAINST ALL WAR INTENDED TO NEGATE IT IN FAVOR OF AN ABSOLUTE VINDICATION FOR PEACE ('PERENNIAL PEACE'). AS EVIDENCED BY "ZUM EWIGEN FRIEDEN" ANALYSIS IN PARAGRAPH TWO, THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONSTRUCTIVE ACTION REQUIRES THE ELIMINATION OF WAR FOR THE PERENNIAL PEACE THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONFLICT IS, AT ITS BEST, PRODUCER OF ITS OWN NEGATION. THE CLOSING PART OF THE ARTICLE TURNS TO NIETZSCHE IN SEARCH OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO GENUINELY UNDERSTAND CONFLICT AND ITS PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL. NIETZSCHE'S LIFE PHILOSOPHY IS AN ONTOLOGY OF CONFLICT THAT CULMINATES IN AN IDEAL OF MAXIMIZING TENSION BASED ON A BALANCE OF MORE OR LESS EQUITABLE POWERS. IT IS ARGUED THAT NIETZSCHE'S NOTION OF AFFIRMATION OF LIFE COMMITS US TO A POSITION THAT IS BETWEEN KANTIAN WAR AND THE COSMOPOLITAN LAW, BRINGING TO OUR ATTENTION THE ANTAGONISTIC RELATIONS WITHIN AND AMONG A PLURALITY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS.
361	IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR BECKERMAN-RODAU EXPLORES AN ARRAY OF UNDERLYING POLICY CONCERNS THAT SHAPE JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING. VARIOUS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IDENTIFY THESE POLICY CONCERNS DIFFERENTLY, DEPENDING ON THEIR POINTS OF VIEW. PROFESSOR BECKERMAN-RODAU SUGGESTS THAT THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF LAW SHIFT OVER TIME TO ACCOMMODATE AND REFLECT CHANGING SOCIETAL NORMS. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, CERTAIN UNDERLYING POLICIES, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY EQUITY AND UNIFORMITY, ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR APPLICATION IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. BECAUSE EVERY RULE OF LAW IS BASED ON SEVERAL UNDERLYING AND OFTEN CONFLICTING POLICY CONSIDERATIONS, PROFESSOR BECKERMAN-RODAU ARGUES THAT THESE COMPETING CONSIDERATIONS ARE EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF MULTI-LAYER, BIPOLAR, OR IN SOME CASES, MULTI-POLAR CONTINUUMS. SPECIFICALLY, THE EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT OF VICARIOUS LIABILITY REPRESENTS BI-POLAR CONTINUUM CONSIDERATIONS, WHEREAS THE REASONABLENESS TEST OF COVENANTS-NOT-TO-COMPETE EXEMPLIFIES A MULTI-POLAR CONTINUUM APPROACH TO LAW. AN EXAMINATION OF THE RIGHT OF PUBLICITY TYPIFIES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF POLICY CONSIDERATIONS IN THE EVOLUTION OF THIS RELATIVELY NEW CAUSE OF ACTION. PREVENTING CONSUMER CONFUSION, PROTECTING BUSINESS REPUTATIONS, ANAL RECOGNIZING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE POLICY CONCERNS THAT WILL AFFECT THE SCOPE OF PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THE RIGHT OF PUBLICITY. THE WEIGHT THAT DECISION MAKERS ASSIGN TO THESE COMPETING POLICY CONSIDERATIONS IS INEVITABLY A PRODUCT OF A COMBINATION OF FACTORS SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL BIASES, COLLECTIVE NORMS, AND THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF LAW AS A MECHANISM FOR THE FAIR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES.
362	MOTIVATION: ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES WITH MARKET ECONOMIES REMAINS ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS WORTH ASSESSING THE EVOLUTION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN 11 COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE: BULGARIA, CROATIA, CZECH REPUBLIC, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, LITHUANIA, LATVIA, POLAND, ROMANIA, SLOVENIA, SLOVAKIA DURING THE PERIOD OF INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN 1996-2022.AIM: THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE RESULTS ON CORRELATION, S-CONVERGENCE AND S-DIVERGENCE, AS WELL AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN ORDER TO CONDUCT COMPARATIVE ANALYZES, THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEXES PUBLISHED BY THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION IN WASHINGTON AND WALL STREET JOURNAL WILL BE USED. THEY MEASURE 12 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ASPECTS GROUPED AROUND THE FOUR PILLARS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM: RULE OF LAW - PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY, JUDICIAL EFFECTIVENESS; GOVERNMENT SIZE - GOVERNMENT SPENDING, TAX BURDEN, FISCAL HEALTH; EFFICIENCY REGULATORS - BUSINESS FREEDOM, LABOUR FREEDOM, MONETARY FREEDOM; OPEN MARKETS - TRADE FREEDOM, INVESTMENT FREEDOM, FINANCIAL FREEDOM.RESULTS: THE OBTAINED RESULTS ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE GENERALLY POSITIVE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN ITS 12 PARTIAL AND 1 GENERAL ASPECTS IN RELATION TO EACH COUNTRY SEPARATELY, AS WELL AS IN RELATION TO THE GROUP OF COUNTRIES THAT JOINED THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER 2003. THEY ARE A SIGNIFICANT SUPPLEMENT TO THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CREATING ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN 11 POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN THE YEARS 1996-2022.
363	RUSSIA'S CONTINUING AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE IS EXCEPTIONAL BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS SCALE AND ITS GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS. A PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE FOR UKRAINE, NEIGHBOURING STATES AND INDEED THE ENTIRE CONTINENT, DEPENDS UPON TWO INTERRELATED FACTORS. THE FIRST IS UKRAINE'S ABILITY TO WIN, WITH WESTERN SUPPORT, THE WAR INITIATED AGAINST IT BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION UNDER PUTIN. THIS WOULD BRING ABOUT A NEW GLOBAL OPENING, ENDING THE MOSCOW -BEIJING ANTI-WESTERN AXIS IN WORLD POLITICS. THE SECOND FACTOR IS UKRAINE'S ABILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT THAT WILL PRESENT ITSELF AS ATTENTION SHIFTS FROM THE MILITARY EFFORT TOWARD THE PROCESS OF STATE RECONSTRUCTION. PRESENTING THE SITUATION OF UKRAINE IN REGIONAL, HISTORICAL, AND GLOBAL CONTEXT, WE DRAW ATTENTION TO SPECIFIC CHALLENGES AND CHOICES THAT STATE ELITES WILL FACE POST-WAR. WE EXPLAIN THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE CHOICES TO SHOW WHY UKRAINE SHOULD SEIZE ITS UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT. DRAWING ON BOTH POLITICAL THEORY AND REAL WORLD EXAMPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT. WE SUGGEST THAT, CHANNELLED TO CONSTRUCTIVE PURPOSES, THE DEMANDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF UKRAINIAN CITIZENS MAY HELP PROPEL THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS NEEDED TO SECURE SOCIAL TRUST AND A STABLE FUTURE. WE CONCLUDE THAT MULTI -LEVEL POLITICAL AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS WILL BE INDISPENSABLE FOR RECONSTRUCTING THE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS FOR PEACE, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN POST -CONFLICT UKRAINE.
364	GIVEN THE BENEFITS OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP), PPP RELATIONS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN THE CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENT OF SUCH RELATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CONTRACTUAL FORM OF PARTNERSHIP AND AN OPEN LIST OF CONTRACTS THAT CAN BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE PPP DO NOT DIFFER IN THEIR CLARITY AND CLARITY OF INTERPRETATION, WHICH RESULTS IN THE AMBIGUITY OF VIEWS ON THE RULE OF LAW WHEN CONCLUDING AGREEMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF CONTRACTUAL REGULATION OF RELATIONS IN THE FIELD OF PPP AND SUGGEST WAYS TO SOLVE THEM. THE WORK AIMS TO STUDY THE PROBLEMS OF CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENT OF PPP. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY SUCH METHODS AS THE DIALECTICAL METHOD, ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION, PROOF AND REFUTATION, COMPARISON, GENERALIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF CONCLUDING AGREEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF PPP WERE ANALYZED. IN PARTICULAR, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT TODAY, DESPITE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PPP, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH PROJECTS HAS SOME PROBLEMS THAT ARE MANIFESTED IN BOTH LEGAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL AREAS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THE GREATER ROLE OF THE STATE PARTNER IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PPP PROJECTS, WHICH IS MANIFESTED IN THE EXPANDED SCOPE OF RIGHTS COMPARED TO THE PRIVATE PARTNER (OWNERSHIP OF FACILITIES CREATED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PPP PROJECTS), AND, ACCORDINGLY, LACK OF BUSINESS INTEREST IN PARTICIPATION IN PROJECTS NOT ON MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TERMS.
365	IN A 2011 DEBATE, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO MAINTAIN THE DEATH PENALTY FOR CORRUPTION WHILE ELIMINATING IT FOR OTHER MORE SERIOUS CRIMES. WHILE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND USE OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN REGARD TO CORRUPTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED, IT IS CRUCIAL TO EXPLORE THE MESSAGES OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. ALTHOUGH EXECUTIONS ARE EXPRESSED IN LEGAL TERMS FOLLOWING THE RULE OF LAW, THE DEATH PENALTY ITSELF IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA, AND IT IS NOTEWORTHY HOW THE CHINESE STATE MEDIA INTERPRETS LEGAL TERMS IN PLAIN LANGUAGE TO CONSTRUCT THE MEANING OF THE DEATH PENALTY. IN OTHER WORDS, HOW DOES FEAR OF CRIME EXIST IF CHINA IS "GOVERNING THROUGH CORRUPTION"?(1) A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 328 CORRUPTION MEDIA REPORTS SHOWS THAT THE REVIVAL OF TRADITIONAL VALUES UNDER STATE CONFUCIANISM REVEALS THE RATIONALE FOR CONDEMNING CORRUPT OFFICIALS TO DEATH. PARALLELS BETWEEN MEDIA REPORTS AND LEGAL ELEMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE IMMORALITY OF THESE OFFICIALS, AS PORTRAYED BY THE MEDIA, FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF LEGAL ARGUMENTS FOR THE DEATH PENALTY, THEREFORE REPRESENTING A STEP FROM IMMORALITY TO ILLEGALITY. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE CULTURAL IMAGE OF THE NEW CAPITALIST CLASS REFLECTS THE WAYS IN WHICH OLD COMMUNIST VALUES PROVIDED A BASIS FOR DENOUNCING WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINALS WHEN CAPITALISM ENTERED CHINA IN 1978; FURTHER, IT SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHES A CULTURE OF CONTROL BY UTILIZING SYMBOLIC RHETORIC IN AN ATTEMPT TO TACKLE CORRUPTION BY GOVERNING THROUGH CORRUPTION.
366	THIS PAPER ASKS HOW PUNITIVE FORMS OF NON-STATE PUNISHMENT PLAY OUT ON THE MARGINS OF THE STATE, IN INFORMAL (SHACK) SETTLEMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA. MY FOCUS IS ON THE PRACTICE OF FORCING THOSE WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF CERTAIN OFFENCES TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS. I REFER TO THIS AS 'BANISHMENT' AND ARGUE THAT IT IS A 'PENAL PHENOMENON' WHICH IS INTIMATELY TIED TO THE GENERAL PRECARITY THAT RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY BASIS. THE PAPER EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE FORMALLY ILLEGAL, BUT NONETHELESS LEGITIMATE PRACTICES, DRAW ON AND RECONFIGURE LIBERAL STATE PUNISHMENT. I USE MY STUDY TO MAKE A BROADER THEORETICAL POINT ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN LAWFUL STATE PUNISHMENT AND UNLAWFUL PUNISHMENT ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE STATE. THE BLURRED BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LEGAL (STATE) VIOLENCE AND ILLEGAL (BUT NONETHELESS LEGITIMATE) VIOLENCE ARE PARTICULARLY 'VISIBLE' IN SITUATIONS OF 'PRECARIOUS PENALITY' - A TERM THAT I USE TO DESCRIBE THE UNSTABLE, VIOLENT AND EXCLUSIONARY PENALITY THAT MANIFESTS IN SITUATIONS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC PRECARITY, PARTICULARLY IN CONTEXTS OF INEQUALITY, HIGH RATES OF VIOLENT CRIME AND A DELEGITIMATED RULE OF LAW. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 'NON-STATE' PUNISHMENT CONTRIBUTES TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GROUP BOUNDARIES AND FULFILS A SIMILAR FUNCTION TO 'FORMAL' PUNISHMENT. THUS, I ASK WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO EXCLUDE 'NON-STATE' PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WHICH ACT AGAINST 'CRIMINALITY', WHEN ASKING WHAT OR WHO CONSTITUTES THE PENAL FIELD AND, WHEN MEASURING STATE PUNITIVENESS?
367	THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO ADDRESS THE DIFFICULT ISSUE OF LIMITING THE WORKING HOURS OF THE MILITARY THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE INJUNCTION. IT WILL SHOW THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEED FOR LIMITATION OF WORKING HOURS AND THE RIGHT TO LEISURE AS A MEANS OF ENABLING HIMSELF THE ENJOYMENT OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, WHICH IS HAMPERED BY THE ABSENCE OF REGULATORY STANDARD THAT LIMITS THE DAILY WORKLOAD, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY TO APPLY TO THE MILITARY. THIS LOOPHOLE HAS ALLOWED NUMEROUS ABUSES BY COMMANDERS IN THE ABSENCE OF REGULATIONS, THEIR SUBORDINATES TO CLIMB INHUMAN HOURS, INJURING, EVEN THE VERY CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN DIGNITY. WILL BE ADDRESSED ALSO THE QUESTION OF RECOGNITION OF THE MILITARY AS A HUMAN PERSON, ENDOWED WITH A CORE OF INTANGIBLE RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO LEISURE. AS A METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE ADOPTED, DEPENDING ON THE OBJECTIVES, WAS CHOSEN BY AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH, IN VIEW OF THE LITTLE MATERIAL AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE WILL BE DISCUSSED, BRIEFLY, THE HISTORICAL QUESTION OF THE LIMITATION OF THE WORKING MAN, FOLLOWED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MILITARY AS A HUMAN BEING AND SUBJECT OF RIGHTS PROTECTED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND, FINALLY, THE SOLUTION WILL BE PRESENTED FOR USE OF THE INJUNCTION AS A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THE LIMITATION OF WORKING HOURS OF THE MILITARY AS A LOGICAL COROLLARY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO LEISURE.
368	THIS ARTICLE IS A CASE STUDY OF STATE SOCIETY CAPITAL CONFLICTS OVER THE PRESERVATION OF THE CENTRAL POLICE STATION (CPS) COMPOUND IN HONG KONG DURING 2003-08. THE CONFLICT WAS BETWEEN TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO URBAN SPACE: A CULTURAL ECONOMY APPROACH THAT TOOK CULTURE AND SPACE AS A SOURCE OF ECONOMIC PROFIT, AND AN OPPOSITION DISCOURSE OF PRESERVATION THAT EMPHASIZED CULTURAL, HISTORICAL AND HUMANISTIC VALUES AS AN END. THE STRUGGLE TURNED OUT TO BE A MODERATE SUCCESS FOR ANTI-COMMERCIALISM. DRAWING ON AND EXTENDING THE NOTIONS OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY AND SPATIAL POLITICS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE VARIOUS CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS, IN THEIR STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMERCIALISM, SOUGHT TO DEFINE AND ENHANCE THE CULTURAL VALUE OF THE SITE THROUGH A VARIETY OF DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES RELATING TO HISTORY AND SPACE. IT ADDRESSES THE SPECIFIC QUESTION OF WHY AND HOW CERTAIN CONSTRUCTIONS OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY SUCCEED (OR FAIL) TO WORK WITH CERTAIN PLACES IN PARTICULAR INSTANCES. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT MEMORIES OF THE CPS COMPOUND CONTAINED BOTH STATE-ASSOCIATED AND PEOPLE-ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTS, BETWEEN WHICH THE FORMER PREVAILED. THE STATE-ASSOCIATED ACCOUNT WAS EMBEDDED IN A FAMILIAR, HEGEMONIC STORY ABOUT HONG KONG, WHICH, VIA AN ABSTRACT PROCESS OF SYMBOLIZATION AROUND THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, SUCCESSFULLY TURNED THE COMPOUND INTO AN ICONIC SYMBOL OF IDENTIFICATION FOR THE CITY. BEYOND THIS, THE CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS SOUGHT ALSO TO GENERATE A SENSE OF LIVED SPACE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PEOPLE, AND THE OUTCOME WAS MIXED.
369	A YOUNG DEFENSE ATTORNEY EARNS HIS CLIENT, CHARGED IN FEDERAL COURT WITH BANK ROBBERY, A JURY ACQUITTAL. (IT'S THE ATTORNEY'S FIRST.) ONE WOULD EXPECT THE IMPARTIAL JUDGE TO THANK THE JURY FOR ITS SERVICE. INSTEAD, THIS ONE HARANGUES BOTH JURY AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY ("ENTAILING CHANGES IN HIS COMPLEXION FROM RED TO PURPLE TO DEAD WHITE"), PUBLICLY RAILS AGAINST THE VERDICT, ATTEMPTS TO BAR THE JURORS FROM FUTURE SERVICE, REFUSES TO RELEASE THE DEFENDANT, AND SUCCESSFULLY PRODS PROSECUTORS TO BRING A DUPLICATIVE STATE PROSECUTION THAT WOULD END IN CONVICTION FOR THE SAME CRIME. TO ANYONE WHO RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW-OR AT THE VERY LEAST TO ANYONE WHO RESPECTS THE AMERICAN JURY-THIS SHOULD BE DEEPLY TROUBLING. YET WHEN IT TOOK PLACE IN A CHICAGO FEDERAL COURTROOM IN DECEMBER 1953, STATE PROSECUTORS LEAPT AT THE FEDERAL JUDGE'S CALL. AND WHEN THE APPEAL OF THE DUPLICATIVE STATE PROSECUTION REACHED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, THE DEFENDANT LOST 5-4. CRIMINAL PRACTITIONERS KNOW THAT RESULT AS BARTKUS V. ILLINOIS, 359 U.S. 121 (1959), A RULE OF DOUBLE-JEOPARDY "DUAL SOVEREIGNTY" THAT THE COURT REAFFIRMED IN 2019. BUT NEXT TO NOBODY APPRECIATES HOW IT BEGAN IN THAT CHICAGO FEDERAL COURTROOM. THAT HISTORY COMES TO LIFE IN THE UNPUBLISHED NOTES OF THE REMARKABLE DEFENSE LAWYER. IT IS A STORY THAT UNDERSCORES JUST HOW WRONGHEADED IS THE LEGAL RULE, AND THAT MAKES VIVID THE ABUSE OF JUDICIAL POWER.
370	THE MAIN TASK OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY A SEPARATE QUALITATIVE PROPERTY CRIMINAL LAW ITS INTELLIGIBILITY. WHEN SOLVING THE PROBLEM THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GENESIS IS FORMULATED THIS CONCEPT AND DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ITS CONTENT, WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED IN MODERN LAW DOCTRINE. IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AUTHOR'S APPROACH TO THE DEFINITION OF INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW THE MONITORING OF NORMATIVE-LEGAL ACTS, DECISIONS OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES IS CARRIED OUT. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE TERM 'INTELLIGIBILITY OF LAW' AND RELATED TERMS 'CLEAR', 'PRECISE', 'SIMPLE' LAW ARE ACTIVELY USED BOTH IN REGULATIONS AND IN DECISIONS OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, THE TERMINOLOGY IS DIVERSE, THEREBY IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO USE THE TERM INTELLIGIBILITY'OF THE LAW, WHICH IS THE MOST ACCURATE AND ADEQUATELY REFLECTS THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LEGAL CERTAINTY OF NATIONAL LAWS. THE GENERAL CONCLUSION IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT IN MODERN DOCTRINE THERE ARE THREE APPROACHES TO DETERMINING THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE LAW: AS A COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE LANGUAGE OF LAW, AS A QUALITATIVE PROPERTY OF LAW. THE ABSENCE OF ANTAGONISTIC FEATURES IN EACH OF THE APPROACHES ALLOWED TO USE THE POSITIVE GAINS OF DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS OF THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW AND TO DEFINE IT.
371	THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE (IWT) IS A LUCRATIVE, CLANDESTINE TRADE THAT ENDANGERS ANIMAL WELFARE, DAMAGES NATIVE BIODIVERSITY AND UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW. DESPITE ENHANCED LAW ENFORCEMENT FOCUS AND INCREASED LITIGATION, THE ILLICIT TRADE OF WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE PRODUCTS HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH. THE INCREASE IN THE IWT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A LACK OF IDENTIFIABLE RELATIONSHIPS, RISK FUNCTIONS AND REWARD SYSTEMS SPECIFIC TO EACH STAKEHOLDER IN THIS ILLICIT MARKET. THE INCREASE IN THE IWT INDICATES THAT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN THEIR INTENT OF PREVENTING THE ILLEGAL TRADE OF VARIOUS WILDLIFE SPECIES. WITHOUT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS, RESOURCES WILL CONTINUE TO BE WASTED ON INEFFECTIVE PREVENTION AND DETECTION METHODS WITH REGARDS TO THE IWT. LAW ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES RELY ON IDENTIFYING KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE IWT AS WELL AS THEIR PERCEIVED MOTIVATIONS, RISKS, AND RELATIONSHIPS. THESE DEFINITIONS MAY PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE MOTIVATIONS DRIVING THESE INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THIS ILLICIT MARKET AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO MORE SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS. STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ROLES WITHIN THE IWT HAVE BEEN DEFINED TO SERVE AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS RISK/REWARD UTILITY FUNCTIONS IN GLOBAL MARKETS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK SUPPORT FOR POLICY MAKERS BY ESTABLISHING BASELINE RISK/REWARD SYSTEMS FOR EACH STAKEHOLDER WHICH CAN BE BUILT UPON AS INTELLIGENCE SURROUNDING THESE STAKEHOLDERS INCREASES. THIS ARTICLE IS CATEGORIZED UNDER: JURISPRUDENCE AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT > COMMUNICATION ACROSS SCIENCE AND LAW JURISPRUDENCE AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT > INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION
372	CORRUPTION ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT UNFOLDS TWO UNIQUE TRENDS: FIRST, THE INVOLVEMENT OF SENIOR STATE OFFICIALS IN THE PERPETRATION OF GRAND CORRUPTION; AND SECONDLY, THE ILLICIT AND SURREPTITIOUS TRANSFER OF STOLEN ASSETS AND FUNDS BEYOND AFRICA'S BORDERS. AS SUCH, AFRICAN STATES ARE HEAVILY DRAINED OF THEIR RESOURCES WHEN CORRUPTION IS COMMITTED. FOREIGN STATES BECOME SAFE HAVENS FOR STOLEN ASSETS FROM AFRICA WHICH MAKES AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT STAGNATED, PARALYSED AND HIJACKED BY THE PERPETRATORS. COMPOUNDED BY A LITANY OF CHALLENGES SUCH AS WEAK INSTITUTIONS; POORLY WRITTEN LAWS; A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY; THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW; A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR; THE PANGS OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT; UNDERMANNED AND UNDER-RESOURCED ANTI-CORRUPTION INSTITUTIONS AND A SHEER ABSENCE OF A STRONG POLITICAL WILL, THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN AFRICA IS ONE OF AFRICA'S BIGGEST BATTLES. WHILE SOME NATIONAL EFFORTS TO OVERCOME THIS INVISIBLE ENEMY AMONGST THE AFRICAN PEOPLE (CORRUPTION) MAY BE COMMENDED, IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH EFFORTS THEMSELVES ARE INSUFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE: A HOLISTIC APPROACH IS MORE THAN NEEDED, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TRENDS IN WHICH GRAND CORRUPTION IN PARTICULAR IS COMMITTED. BORROWING FROM RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT IT IS A MORAL AND LEGAL IMPERATIVE FOR NON-AFRICAN STATES TO ENJOIN AFRICA IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. IN MAKING THIS THESIS, THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH SUCH NON-AFRICAN STATES CAN HELP AFRICA IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION.
373	THE PASSAGE OF 25TH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF PAKISTAN GUARANTEED DOING AWAY OF ARTICLES 246 AND 247 IN THE CONSTITUTION WHICH HAD RESTRICTED THE APPLICATION OF PARLIAMENTARY AND PROVINCIAL LAWS OF THE LAND TO THE TRIBAL AREAS. THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE THUS EXTENDS FULLY TO THE AREAS THAT STAND MERGED WITH THE KP PROVINCE. THE COLONIAL PAST HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY REPLACING THE SYSTEM OF FCR WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. AMIDST ALL HOPES NEW CHALLENGES OF GOVERNANCE ARE ALSO LIKELY TO DEVELOP. IN THE CONTEXT, THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES IN MAINSTREAMING OF FEDERALLY ADMINISTERED TRIBAL AREAS INTO KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON CHALLENGES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, JURISDICTION AND LAND REVENUE. THIS STUDY IS CONDUCTED BY USING HISTORICAL AND ANALYTICAL APPROACHES WITH DESCRIPTIVE AND EXPLANATORY MODE OF RESEARCH. BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA IS UTILIZED IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE RESEARCH PROBLEM. WEAK STATES WITH SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS OF GOVERNANCE (AUTHORITY), CAPACITY AND LEGITIMACY OFTEN FACE PERSISTENT CHALLENGES IN CONTROLLING THEIR TERRITORIES, LEADING TO THE EMERGENCE OF UNGOVERNED AREAS WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES. AUTHORITY, CAPACITY AND LEGITIMACY ARE INTERDEPENDENT AND HENCE THEIR BALANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR STATE-BUILDING. AN IMBALANCE IN THEM WEAKENS INSTEAD OF STRENGTHENING A STATE. ACCORDINGLY, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD EXTEND JURISDICTION, ENSURE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GENERATION OF REVENUE IN FATA IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL OF STATE-BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE.
374	2012 WAS THE YEAR WHEN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS RECEIVED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE, AN HONORED AND PRESTIGIOUS DISTINCTION. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS NOT TO ANALYZE THE REASON WHICH LED THE NORWEGIAN PARLIAMENT TO AWARD IT, BUT ITS POSSIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE EU. THIS STATEMENT IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE STARTING POINT OF OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT THE EU HAS DEVELOPED AT SUCH A LEVEL THAT NOTHING COULD UNDERMINE IT. OUR RESEARCH CONSISTS IN CONFIRMING THIS HYPOTHESIS FROM A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH THAT WILL MEASURE THE TWENTY-SEVEN EU MEMBER-STATES, FROM 2007 UNTIL 2012, AND THEIR REPRESENTATION ACCORDING TO SIX VARIABLES (INDICES). PEACE REPRESENTS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, WHILE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, RULE OF LAW, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRACY PLAY THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. BECAUSE THE FACT THAT DETERMINED US TO WRITE THIS PAPER WAS THE NOBEL PRIZE DISTINCTION AWARDED TO THE EU, THE MAIN POINT OF OUR RESEARCH IS PEACE AND ITS CORRELATION WITH THE OTHER FIVE ELEMENTS. THE RESULTS PROVE THAT THE MOST RELEVANT CONNECTION IS FOUND BETWEEN PEACE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER ONES ARE NOT TO BE NEGLECTED EITHER. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS THEREFORE FOCUSES ON PEACE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS FROM A THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW. IN THE END, PEACE IN THE EU IS THE RESULT OF TWENTY-SEVEN MEMBERS' EFFORTS AND ITS EFFICIENCY IS REAL ONLY TO THOSE STATES THAT ARE UNDER ITS UMBRELLA.
375	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE REFORM IN POST-CONFLICT BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, NOTABLY THAT OF THE UN AND THE EU. DESPITE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS AND RESOURCES DEPLOYED OVER 17 YEARS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE REFORM REMAINS AN 'UNFINISHED BUSINESS' THAT DEMONSTRATES THE SLOW PACE OF IMPLEMENTING RULE OF LAW REFORMS IN BOSNIA'S POST-CONFLICT SETTING, YET, IN THE LONG-TERM, REMAINS VITAL FOR BOSNIA'S STABILITY AND POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS. STARTING WITH A PRESENTATION OF THE STATUS OF THE POLICE BEFORE AND AFTER THE CONFLICT, UN REFORMS (19952002) ARE FIRST DISCUSSED IN ORDER TO SET THE STAGE FOR AN ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF THE EU IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE REFORM. HERE, PARTICULAR EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE INSTITUTIONBUILDING ACTIONS OF THE EU POLICE MISSION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA DEPLOYED ON THE GROUND FOR ALMOST A DECADE (2003-JUNE 2012). THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF UN AND EU EFFORTS IN POST-CONFLICT BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, INCLUDING THE REMAINING CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED BY THE EU ON THE GROUND, AS THE CURRENT LEADER TO POLICE REFORM IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS. MORE GENERALLY, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THAT FOR POLICE REFORM TO SUCCEED IN THE LONG-TERM, FROM 2012-ONWARDS, THE EU SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL LEVEL, WHERE MOST OF THE STUMBLING BLOCKS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE REFORM LIE.
376	GOVERNANCE, WHICH IS THE AMALGAMATION OF MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION CONCEPTS, SIMPLY REFERS TO MANAGING TOGETHER. GOOD GOVERNANCE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE INDICATOR OF REPRESENTATION, PARTICIPATION AND CONTROL IN STATE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS AN INICATOR OF EFFECTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY, RULE OF LAW, RESPONSIBILITY OF OPENNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE EXISTENCE OF ETHICS AND QUALITY. THIS CONCEPT IMPLIES THAT GOVERNING POWER HAS EXCEEDED THE CLASSIC STATE AUTHORITY. IN THE SAME WAY, A LARGE-SCALE SENSE OF DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN ELABORATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 'CIVIL SOCIETY' IN THE GOVERNING PROCESS ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC. IN OTHER WORDS, GOVERNING HAS GAINED A DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTIC AS SELF-GOVERNMENT OF A SOCIETY BY BREAKING UP THE MONOPOLY OF THE STATE IN THIS SENSE. AT THIS POINT, WE OBSERVE THE DEFORMATION OF THE IDEOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL CONTENT OF THE BASIC CONCEPTS, SUCH AS 'POLITICS,' AND 'STATE' THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUESTION THE APPLICABILITY OF SUCH AN APPROACH IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING GOOD GOVERNANCE BY DISPLAYING THE IMPORTANCE AND EFFECT OF LEADERSHIP AND CULTURE NOTIONS. THUS, A CRISIS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND TUSIAD (THE SOCIETY OF TURKISH INDUSTRIALISTS AND BUSINESSMEN) HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS AN EXAMPLE. THE NEWS ABOUT THE RESPECTIVE CRISIS HAS BEEN STUDIED IN TWO TURKISH NEWSPAPERS WITH THE HIGHEST CIRCULATION RATES IN TURKEY ACCORDING TO VAN DIJK'S CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS METHOD.
377	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE AND ANALYSE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE RELATIVE SUCCESS AND FAILURE OF NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT (NPM) INITIATIVES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO SINGAPORE AND BANGLADESH. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - SECONDARY MATERIALS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED, INTERPRETED AND REINTERPRETED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE ARGUMENTS. THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONFINED TO TWO COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE EXPERIENCES OF NPM INITIATIVES OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALSO BEEN ANALYSED TO STRENGTHEN THE ARGUMENTS. FINDINGS - THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE EXISTENCE OF A FORMAL MARKET ECONOMY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND STATE EFFICIENCY FOR THE SUCCESS OF NPM-ORIENTED REFORMS. TO A LARGE EXTENT, SINGAPORE FULFILLS THESE CONDITIONS. BANGLADESH IS LAGGING BEHIND THESE CONDITIONS, AND HAS ACHIEVED VERY LITTLE IN NPM INITIATIVES. THE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT THERE IS STILL A GREATER ROLE OF THE STATE IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN GENERAL AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MARKET-ORIENTED REFORMS IN PARTICULAR. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE SINGAPORE CASE OFFERS AMPLE LESSONS FOR LOW-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS BANGLADESH WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE VALUE OF THE PAPER LIES IN CLEARLY DELINEATING THE FACTORS OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE AND RELATING THESE TO CONCRETE CASES ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, ANALYSES OF THE BANGLADESH CASE COULD BE OF IMMENSE VALUE TO STATE DECISION MAKERS OF BANGLADESH AND COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STANDINGS.
378	THE ORGANIZATIONAL LOGIC OF THE LEGAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION TREATS AS SUSPECT ECONOMIC REGULATION ISSUING OUT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OF NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL COMMUNITIES. IN THIS WAY, ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION CAN BE LIKENED TO STATE FORMATION: AS A CULTURAL PROJECT WITH THE OBJECT OF ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING ALTERNATIVES. WHILE UNDERMINING THE REGULATORY CAPACITY OF LOCAL PUBLICS TO TAME MARKETS, TRANSNATIONAL LEGALITY PREFERS TO DRAW ON THE NORMATIVE IDEAS OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE, CONSUMER FREEDOM, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE DISCURSIVE STRATEGIES PROVE AN UNSTABLE BASIS FOR LEGITIMATION WITHOUT THE CRITICAL SUPPORTS PROVIDED BY NATIONAL STATES IN GAINING AND MAINTAINING THE CONSENT OF LOCAL PUBLICS. AS THE FINDINGS OF A RECENT INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION PANEL INDICATE (CMS V. ARGENTINA), TRANSNATIONAL LEGALITY PREFERS TO VIEW THE LOCAL AS A THREAT TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ITS POLITICAL-ECONOMIC ORDER, ONE OF OPEN BORDERS FREE OF RENT-SEEKING PUBLIC REGULATION. THIS WILL BE THE CASE EVEN WHEN STATES, LIKE ARGENTINA, TAKE MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE HARDSHIPS OF A SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. SOME CRITICAL THEORISTS, LIKE HARDT & NEGRI IN EMPIRE, SIMILARLY RELEGATE THE LOCAL TO A MARGINAL PLACE WITHOUT APPRECIATING ITS CONTRADICTORY BUT SUSTAINING ROLE IN GLOBALIZATION'S FUTURE. SUCH THEORETICAL INTERVENTIONS, OPERATING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DISCIPLINING EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION'S LEGAL ORDER, HELP TO IMMOBILIZE, RATHER THAN EMPOWER, RESISTANCE TO THE MONOCULTURES OF TRANSNATIONAL LEGALITY. THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER THE SHAKY FOUNDATIONS UPON WHICH THE LEGITIMACY OF TRANSNATIONAL LEGALITY ARE STRUCTURED WILL PROVE LESS DURABLE THAN ITS IMMOBILIZING EFFECTS.
379	THE CLASSIC JUSTIFICATION FOR OBSCENITY LAW IS TO PREVENT READERS FROM BEING DEPRAVED AND CORRUPTED BY SEXUALLY ORIENTED PUBLICATIONS. MORAL HARM IS NOT AN UNFAMILIAR IDEA. IT IS WHAT MOST PARENTS HAVE IN MIND WHEN THEY CENSOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED TO SEE. YET LIBERAL CRITICS OF THE DOCTRINE HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD IT, AND SO HAVE OFTEN MISSED THE POINT OF THE LAWS THEY WERE CRITICIZING. TEXTS SHAPE OUR VIEW OF THE WORLD. JUST AS GOOD LITERATURE INVITES US TO PERCEIVE THE WORLD SUBTLY AND EMPATHETICALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE - INDEED, IT IS COMMON-FOR NOVELS, FILMS, OR TELEVISION SHOWS TO VIEW THE WORLD CRUDELY AND INSENSITIVELY, AND TO SPIN OUT SELF-AGGRANDIZING FANTASIES THAT INVITE SELF-CENTEREDNESS AND CRUELTY. TEXTS THAT DO THIS CAN INDEED CAUSE MORAL HARM. DISCERNING THE MORAL CONTENT OF TEXTS IS, HOWEVER, TOO COMPLEX A TASK FOR THE LAW TO UNDERTAKE. SOME PORNOGRAPHY IS MORALLY BAD BECAUSE IT ENCOURAGES THE READER TO REGARD OTHER PEOPLE AS MERE OBJECTS OF SEXUAL INTEREST, WHOSE FEELINGS AND DESIRES DO NOT MATTER. BUT THIS CANNOT BE THE BASIS FOR A WORKABLE LEGAL TEST FOR OBSCENITY, BECAUSE IT IS TOO VAGUE AND ITS APPLICATION TOO CONTESTABLE TO BE A RULE OF LAW. MORAL HARM IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH, AND ONLY FORTUITOUSLY OVERLAPS WITH, WHAT ANY LEGAL TEST FOCUSES ON: THE DISSEMINATION OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF IMAGES OR SUBJECT MATTER. OBSCENITY LAW IS THUS AN UNSUITABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IT SEEKS TO ADDRESS, AND SHOULD BE ABANDONED.
380	WITH ITS JUDGMENT OF 22 DECEMBER 2020, IN THE CASE DEMIRTAS V. TURKEY THE GRAND CHAMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS CONFIRMED THE PREVIOUS DECISION OF THE SECOND SECTION, RULING ON THE INITIAL AND CONTINUED PRE-TRIAL DETENTION OF SELAHATTIN DEMIRTAS, FORMER CO-CHAIR OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE GRAND CHAMBER FOUND THAT TURKEY HAS COMMITTED SEVERAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION. IN PARTICULAR, THE COURT FOUND VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 10 (FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION), ART. 5.1 AND ART. 5.3 (RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY), ART. 3 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 (RIGHT TO FREE ELECTIONS) AND ART. 18 (LIMITATION ON USE OF RESTRICTIONS ON RIGHTS) IN CONJUNCTION WITH ART. 5. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COURT HELD THE RESPONDENT HAS TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY MEASURES TO SECURE THE APPLICANT'S IMMEDIATE RELEASE, RULING ON ART. 46 OF THE CONVENTION. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION AIMS AT ANALYZING THE JUDGMENT, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE FINDINGS RELATING TO THE VIOLATION OF ART. 18 IN CONNECTION WITH ART. 5, THE NOTION OF ULTERIOR PURPOSE AND THE ARGUMENTATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE COURT'S JUDGMENT. THE RULING, IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO THE FINDINGS ABOUT ART. 18, CONSTITUTE AN EXAMPLE OF FORCEFUL JURISDICTIONAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEMOCRATIC CRISIS SUCH AS TURKEY'S, IN LINE WITH THE RECENT EVOLUTION OF THE CASE-LAW ON ART. 18 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS.
381	WE USE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM PERSPECTIVE TO STUDY POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A FORM OF ALIGNMENT BETWEEN DISRUPTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURS WITH AUTHORITIES AIMING TO GET PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO RESOURCES. POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP (PE) HAS EMERGED AS A PHENOMENON IN TRANSITION AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES AND MAY COMPROMISE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM (EE) OBJECTIVES. COMBINING INTERVIEW AND SURVEY DATA, THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH ASSESSMENT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEMS IN A TRANSITION ECONOMY AND THE ROLE THAT POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURS PLAY IN MODERATING THE EFFECT OF RESOURCES ON THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. OUR FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE TO OTHER TRANSITION AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES AS WE DEMONSTRATE WHAT VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS OF FACTORS INCREASE STAKEHOLDERS' PERCEPTION ABOUT EE AND DIRECTLY AFFECT ITS QUALITY. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT STAKEHOLDERS APPRECIATE THE EVOLUTION TRENDS TOWARDS MATURE AND PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, BUT THE PROGRESS IS SLOW, NONLINEAR, WITH SETBACKS, STILL SERIOUSLY THREATENED BY CORRUPTION, LACK OF COMPETENCE, AND THE INTERFERENCE OF THE POLITICAL FACTOR AS WELL AS REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. THIS STUDY OFFERS IMPLICATIONS ON HOW TO ADOPT A PLACE-BASED AND HOLISTIC APPROACH TO INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WHEN POLICYMAKERS AIM AT CREATING PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEMS. THIS STUDY IMPLICATIONS ARE IN THE ADOPTION OF A PLACE-BASED AND HOLISTIC APPROACH TO INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WHEN POLICYMAKERS AIM AT CREATING PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEMS. WHILE POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DISTORT AN ECOSYSTEM, THIS STUDY OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGERS AND POLICYMAKERS WHO PLAN TO START A BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
382	OBJECTIVES THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE MERITS OF COMMERCIALLY-BASED SURVEY DATA ON CRIME THROUGH CROSS-VALIDATION WITH ESTABLISHED CRIME METRICS. METHODS USING UNPUBLISHED DATA FROM 166 COUNTRIES COVERING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2006 AND 2019, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION ACROSS GLOBAL REGIONS AND TRENDS OVER TIME OF THREE TYPES OF COMMON CRIME, HOMICIDE, AND ORGANISED CRIME. THE ARTICLE THEN EXPLORES POSSIBLE DETERMINANTS OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTIONS THROUGH REGRESSING PREVALENCE RATES AGAINST INDICES OF POVERTY, INEQUALITY, PROPORTION OF YOUTH, PRESENCE OF CRIMINAL OPPORTUNITIES (WEALTH AND URBANISATION), AND GOVERNANCE/RULE OF LAW. RESULTS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AFRICAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES SUFFER FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF CRIME ACROSS THE BOARD, FOLLOWED BY COUNTRIES IN ASIA. EUROPEAN, NORTH AMERICAN AND AUSTRALIAN COUNTRIES EXPERIENCE INTERMEDIATE OR RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF MOST TYPES OF CRIME. LEVELS OF COMMON CRIME HAVE DROPPED OR STABILIZED GLOBALLY EXCEPT IN AFRICA WHERE THEY WENT UP. HOMICIDES HAVE FALLEN ALMOST UNIVERSALLY. TRENDS IN ORGANISED CRIME ARE DIVERGING. CONCLUSIONS DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE EMERGED AS POWERFUL DETERMINANTS OF LEVELS OF ALL TYPES OF CRIME. IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF COMMON CRIME BESIDES GOVERNANCE WERE POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND PROPORTION OF YOUTH. TO SOME EXTENT CHANGES IN THESE SAME CHARACTERISTICS OF COUNTRIES WERE FOUND TO BE CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN LEVELS OF CRIME OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE STUDY'S LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.
383	OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY REFERENCES TO THE THEME OF SPORT IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. METHODOLOGY / APPROACH: THE RESEARCH CORPUS INCLUDED THE TEXTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONS OF 32 COUNTRIES, AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BASED ON KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE SPORT THEME, IN FOUR LANGUAGES (SPORT, SPORT, DEPORTE, ESPORTE). THE DATA ANALYSIS USED THE COMPARATIVE METHOD. ORIGINALITY / RELEVANCE: THIS RESEARCH IS BASED ON A DISCUSSION UNDER THE LAW AND HAS COLLECTED DATA ABOUT SPORT IN CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS. MAIN RESULTS: THE SECTIONS IN WHICH ARTICLES DEALING WITH SPORT APPEAR ADDRESS THREE MAIN THEMES: FUNDAMENTAL/SOCIAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES; DUTY/ATTRIBUTION OF THE STATE TO PROMOTE SPORT; AND ORGANIZATION OF STATE COMPETENCES. HOWEVER, A DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHT TO SPORT - ALBEIT IN THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION, IN THE HIERARCHICALLY SUPERIOR RULE TO ALL OTHERS, AND FOUNDING THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW - SHOWS THAT, IN SOME CONTEXTS, THE EFFECTIVENESS IS NOT FULL. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, BEING THE SPORT RECOGNIZED AS SOCIALLY RELEVANT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THESE RIGHTS BECOME EFFECTIVE, NOT JUST DECLARATIONS OF INTENT. THEORETICAL / METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS: IT PRESENTS A BASIS FOR DATA COLLECTION NOT USUAL IN THE RESEARCH AREA OF SPORTS, AND SUITABLE FOR RESEARCH WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS LINKED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE APPRECIATION OF THE THEME IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE LAW VIEW CONFIGURES A RELEVANT METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION, DUE TO THE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW IN THE DATA ANALYSIS.
384	CRIMINAL LAW IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES IS UNDERGOING A TRANSFORMATION OR ACCORDING TO SOME, EVEN A PARADIGM SHIFT. THE REACH OF CRIMINAL LAW IS NOW EXTENDED TO TERRAINS THAT WERE HITHERTO IMMUNE TO CRIMINALIZATION. THESE NEW FORMS OF CRIMINALIZATION. IN POST-HEROIC RISK SOCIETIES ARE TARGETING CONDUCT WELL BEFORE IT CAUSES A HARM. THE PRIME EXAMPLES OF THIS PREVENTIVE CRIMINALIZATION. ARE PRE-IN-CHOATE OFFENCES, CRIMES OF POSSESSION OF "INNOCENT" OBJECTS AND CRIMES OF ABSTRACT ENDANGERMENT. THE COMMON TRAIT OF THESE OFFENCES IS THAT THEY ENABLE THE SO-CALLED PREPONING CRIMINAL LIABILITY (VORVERLAGERUNG), THROUGH WHICH THE EARLIEST OF PREPARATORY ACTS, NEUTRAL, EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MERELY STANDING AROUND OR MERELY POSSESSING MAY WELL FALL WITHIN THE REACH OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS PHENOMENON IS NOW TAKING PLACE VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE CONSIDERED BY MANY AS AN EROSION OF THE TRADITIONAL POST-ENLIGHTENMENT CRIMINAL LAW MODEL. YET, PROPONENTS OF THE PREVENTIVE CRIMINAL LAW ARE SUGGESTING THAT SUCH LAWS ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO AVERT RISKS (TERRORIST ATTACKS, FOR INSTANCE) WHILE THEY ARE AT PREPARATION PHASE. THERE IS, THEREFORE, A TENSION BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL LAW AND NEW SECURITY INTERESTS THAT POSE NEW QUESTIONS WHICH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY A METICULOUS ANALYSIS. IN THIS ARTICLE I SHALL TRY TO DEAL WITH FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: WHETHER THESE PREVENTIVE OFFENCES ARE INHERENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW? HOW FAR A LAW-ABIDING NATION CAN GO IN CRIMINALIZING PREPARATORY ACTS? ARE THERE ANY PROMISING CONSTRAINING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OR INSTANCES THAT DELIMIT PREVENTIVE CRIMINALIZATION?
385	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE DIFFERENT ROLES, IMPACT, AND OPERATION OF BILATERAL TREATIES AND MULTILATERAL TREATIES AS STRUCTURES WITHIN THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. I OBSERVE THAT THE PREFERENCE FOR BILATERALISM OR MULTILATERALISM IN INTERNATIONAL LAWMAKING IS OFTEN DETERMINED NOT BY AN INFORMED CHOICE BUT BY AN INSTINCTIVE ASSOCIATION OF POLITICAL SCHOOLS OR BUREAUCRATIC AFFILIATIONS WITH DIFFERENT FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATION. THIS ASSOCIATION, HOWEVER, IS NOT ALWAYS FOUNDED ON A JUST APPRECIATION OF THE WORKINGS OF EITHER FORM IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS OR OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE TWO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. I SET OUT TO OFFER A FRAMEWORK FOR SUCH AN APPRECIATION AND ASSESS THE WORKINGS OF MULTILATERAL TREATIES AND BILATERAL TREATIES ALONG THREE DIMENSIONS: THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RESPECTIVE INSTRUMENTS TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW; THE OPERATION OF THE REGIME IN TERMS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY, AND COMPLIANCE; AND THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE MAKING OF EACH REGIME. I DEMONSTRATE THAT IDEOLOGIES AND VALUES THAT SEEM TO HE ALMOST BLINDLY ASSOCIATED WITH ONE TYPE OF REGULATION MAY HE ACTUALLY BETTER SERVED IN SOME CASES, BY USING THE OTHER TYPE. ULTIMATELY, THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO CHART A COURSE FOR MORE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FORAYS INTO THE QUESTIONS OF WHY STATES JOIN PARTICULAR TYPES OF TREATIES AND HOW THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TREATIES, OR A COMBINATION OF THEM, PROMOTE OR OBSTRUCT THE ATTAINMENT OF VARIOUS GOALS WITHIN THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
386	THE DEBATE ON THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN OECD COUNTRIES HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TOWARDS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS. GIVEN THAT MIGRATION FLOWS ARE DETERMINED BY IMMIGRATION LAWS, THE PROBABILITY OF POTENTIAL DETECTION, PENALTIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED MIGRANTS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS, AND INCOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SENDING AND RECEIVING COUNTRIES, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION, GROUNDED ON THE ECONOMIC THEORY OF ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR. THE FRAMEWORK CONSIDERS THE INTERACTION OF POTENTIAL MIGRANTS, CITIZENS, EMPLOYERS, AND THE GOVERNMENT. AFTER INTRODUCING THE SUPPLY FUNCTION OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND ITS DETERMINANTS, THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN SOCIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PREVENTING AND COMBATING ILLEGAL MIGRATION IS DEMONSTRATED. THIS TRADE-OFF RESULTS IN AN OPTIMAL LEVEL OF MIGRATION LARGER THAN ZERO. A COMPLETE "MARKET MODEL" OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION IS OFFERED BY PRESENTATION OF A DEMAND CURVE OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION, BASED ON THE TOLERANCE OF THE SOCIETY TOWARDS CLANDESTINE FOREIGNERS. EQUILIBRIUM FORCES PREDICT A NON-ZERO LEVEL OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION. THE RULE OF LAW OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEMS, ACCORDING TO WHICH ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY HAS TO BE REDUCED TO ZERO, BEARS THE DANGER OF PRODUCING INEFFICIENT DISEQUILIBRIA. A REASONABLE POLICY OF WANTED AND UNWANTED MIGRATION SHOULD ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO ALLOCATE SCARCE RESOURCES. IGNORING SOCIAL OPTIMA AND EQUILIBRIUM FORCES MEANS TO ABANDON PUBLIC RESOURCES THAT COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PUBLIC ASSIGNMENTS, SUCH AS SCHOOLING OR FOREIGN AID, FOR INSTANCE, I.E., MEASURES THAT COULD STRIKE THE PROBLEM OF ILLEGAL MIGRATION AT ITS ROOT.
387	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FIRM-LEVEL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE DATA INCLUDE NON-FINANCIAL FIRMS LISTED IN STOCK EXCHANGES IN G8 AND MENA COUNTRIES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FIRMS IN THE G8 AND MENA IS 347 AND 389, RESPECTIVELY, COVERING THE PERIOD 2017-2020. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN THE G8 COUNTRIES, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS ASSOCIATED SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY WITH ASSET EFFICIENCY, EXPENSE CONTROL, DEBT FINANCING, AND LIQUIDITY. IN THE MENA COUNTRIES, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS ASSOCIATED SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY WITH LIQUIDITY AND PROFITABILITY, BUT NEGATIVELY WITH ASSET EFFICIENCY, EXPENSE CONTROL, AND DEBT FINANCING. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF CORPORATE SIZE IS ASYMMETRICAL. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE BETWEEN G8 AND MENA COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. NEVERTHELESS, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE G8 IS BETTER OFF THAT OF THE MENA COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND REGULATORY QUALITY. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE DURATION OF IMPROVEMENT IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TAKES BETWEEN 2-4 YEARS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF FIRMS' FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS PAPER OFFERS A CONTRIBUTION TO CORPORATE MANAGERS IN TERMS OF OFFERING A GUIDE TO DESIGN FINANCIAL STRATEGIES THAT ADAPTS TO THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. A FURTHER CONTRIBUTION IS OFFERED TO POLICY MAKERS IN TERMS OF OFFERING A ROAD MAP TO IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAT HELPS IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS SECTOR.
388	EVERY SOCIETY NEEDS THE RECOGNITION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS, AND THIS BECOMES MORE PROPER FOR EVERY ADMINISTRATION IN RESPECTING THIS PROTECTION FOR THE COMMON GOOD OF ITS SOCIETY. IN THIS ARTICLE, INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF PROTECTING PRIVATE RIGHTS IN THE SPHERE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ANALYZED. ON THE BASIS OF THE RESEARCHED INFORMATION THE AUTHORS HAVE PROVIDED CONCRETE WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING THE SPECIFIED INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE INTO DOMESTIC STATE AND HIS LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ESSENCE AND CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF LEGAL WAYS TO PROTECT THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN PUBLIC RELATIONS HAVE BEEN CLARIFIED AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE GENESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WAYS TO PROTECT PRIVATE RIGHTS IN THE SPHERE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ANALYZED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE INSUFFICIENT CAPACITY OF UKRAINE TO ENSURE THE INVIOLABILITY OF PRIVATE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND INTERESTS OF THE ENTITIES OF PUBLIC LEGAL RELATIONS, COMPARED TO THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN MADE ON THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. IT HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT A SPECIAL "ACCELERATION" OF THE INDICATED REFORMS TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AFTER TWO SOCIALLY IMPORTANT EVENTS, NAMELY THE ORANGE REVOLUTION OF 2004 AND THE REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY OF 2013-2014. HOWEVER, THE SO-CALLED "ENERGY FERVOR" GAINED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE REFORM IS SLOWING DOWN IN UKRAINE.
389	TWENTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE AUTHOR'S DELIVERY IN 2000 OF THE GENERAL COURSE OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW AT THE HAGUE ACADEMY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, TITLED 'THE UNITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER'. THAT COURSE WAS DESIGNED TO COMBAT THE ALL-TOO-COMMON IDEA THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW WAS IN THE PROCESS OF 'FRAGMENTATION'. IT DID SO BY DEVELOPING A THEORY FOCUSED ON THE EXISTENCE OF AND TENSION BETWEEN TWO FORMS OF UNITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER: THE FORMAL UNITY (CONCERNING THE PROCEDURES BY WHICH PRIMARY NORMS ARE CREATED AND INTERPRETED, AND THEIR NON-COMPLIANCE ADJUDICATED) AND THE MATERIAL UNITY (BASED ON THE CONTENT OF CERTAIN NORMS OF GENERAL INTERNATIONAL LAW, PEREMPTORY NORMS). TWENTY YEARS LATER, THE TIME IS RIPE TO REVISIT THIS THEORY TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS STILL VALID AS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, PARTICULARLY AS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF 'POPULIST' LEADERS VERY MUCH SEEM TO IGNORE, OR VOLUNTARILY DENY, THE VALIDITY OF SOME OF THE KEY SUBSTANTIAL PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER WAS REFOUNDED WITHIN AND AROUND THE UNITED NATIONS IN 1945. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE FACTUAL REALITY OF THE PRESENT STATE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AS WELL AS WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE LAW, ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE VALIDITY OF THE UNITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IS UNFAILINGLY MAINTAINED, AND THAT ITS ROLE IN UPHOLDING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER.
390	POSSIBILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS FOR ACHIEVING LEGAL UNITY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN MULTIPLE AND ILLUSTRATIVE WAYS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATION BETWEEN JUDGES IN EU MEMBER STATES. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT DISCUSSIONS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN HUNGARY AND POLAND UNDERLINE THAT WE ARE STILL QUITE FAR REMOVED FROM THE REALISATION OF A SHARED EUROPEAN NORMATIVE BASIS FOR JUDICIAL FUNCTIONING, THAT IS: A SHARED 'JUDICIAL CULTURE'. THESE DISCUSSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH A BASIS FOR THE REALISATION OF THE IDEAL OF THE 'RULE OF LAW'. AS A STEPPING STONE FOR FUTURE INTERDISCIPLINARY LEGAL RESEARCH, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF 'JUDICIAL CULTURE' AND THREE OF ITS CORE DIMENSIONS (ETHICAL, LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL), WHICH HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE IN LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP SO FAR. OUR ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT BY CAREFULLY ESTABLISHING IN WHICH TYPES OF SOURCES WE CAN LOCATE THE RESPECTIVE DIMENSIONS, AND BY DESIGNING A METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYSING THESE SOURCES, SCHOLARS CAN ANALYSE JUDICIAL CULTURES IN A MORE IN-DEPTH AND SYSTEMATIC MANNER. IN THIS WAY, SPECIFIC CONCEPTUAL 'LENSES' BECOME AVAILABLE FOR THE COLLECTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION AND EMPIRICAL DATA, FOR THE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF THESE RESULTS AND EVENTUALLY FOR A NORMATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE POSSIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY OF CONVERGENCE OF JUDICIAL CULTURES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THIS ANALYSIS AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHER INSIGHT INTO QUESTIONS ON LEGAL UNITY AND ITS REALISATION IN A CONTEXT OF DIVERGING SOCIAL PRESSURES.
391	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLAIN WHY CORRUPTION IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN MYANMAR AND WHY THE ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES INITIATED BY ITS MILITARY GOVERNMENT ARE INEFFECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER DESCRIBES MYANMAR'S UNFAVOURABLE POLICY CONTEXT AND ANALYSES THE PERCEIVED EXTENT AND CAUSES OF CORRUPTION IN MYANMAR BEFORE EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES. FINDINGS - MYANMAR'S LOCATION IN A BAD NEIGHBOURHOOD SURROUNDED BY CORRUPT COUNTRIES, ITS VULNERABILITY TO THE NATURAL RESOURCE CURSE AND ETHNIC CONFLICT, AS WELL AS MORE THAN FIVE DECADES OF INEFFECTIVE MILITARY RULE HAVE HINDERED ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS. CORRUPTION REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN MYANMAR BECAUSE OF THE MILITARY REGIME'S LACK OF POLITICAL WILL AND FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE CAUSES: LOW SALARIES; RED TAPE; WEAK RULE OF LAW; AND CULTURAL FACTORS. THE ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION (ACC)'S PERFORMANCE DURING ITS FIRST TWO YEARS CANNOT BE ASSESSED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFORMATION ON ITS BUDGET, PERSONNEL AND ACTIVITIES. AS THE ACC IS LED BY TWO FORMER MILITARY GENERALS, IT IS NOT PERCEIVED TO BE INDEPENDENT, AND HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR FOCUSING ON INVESTIGATING CORRUPTION CASES AND CORRUPTION PREVENTION AT THE EXPENSE OF CORRUPTION EDUCATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER WILL BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE POLICY-MAKERS, SCHOLARS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION PRACTITIONERS, WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT THE CAUSES OF RAMPANT CORRUPTION IN MYANMAR AND WHY THE ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES INITIATED HAVE FAILED TO CURB IT.
392	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO RECONCILE THE DIFFICULTIES IN LEGAL CLASSIFICATION THAT ARISE WHEN SUBJECT MATTER IS VIEWED FROM A PURELY SPATIAL, I.E., A TWO OR THREE-DIMENSIONAL, PERSPECTIVE. AT ISSUE IS WHETHER THE DYNAMIC COMPLEXITY OF LEGAL REASONING CAN BE REPRESENTED THROUGH A PROCESS OF STATIC CLASSIFICATION. THE DIFFICULTY WITH TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO CLASSIFICATION IS THAT WHILE LEGAL REASONING MAKES USE OF CONCURRENT CONCEPTS TO RESOLVE ISSUES, CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS OPERATE WITH MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CLASSES THAT DO NOT PERMIT REPRESENTATION OF REITERATIVE REASONING PROCESSES. USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE NEOLOGISM OF "PROPERTIZATION, "AN ISSUE OF INCREASING CONCERN IN THE FIELD OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DEMONSTRATE THAT A SINGLE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM CAN REPRESENT BOTH THE DELERMINACY THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO AND INDETERMINACY OF LEGAL CONCEPTS AS THEY ARE USED TO RESOLVE LEGAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE CLARITY PRESUMABLY REQUIRED FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO OPERATE. RESOLUTION REQUIRES ADOPTING A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT MAKES USE OF BOTH A TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE. BY ADOPTING A TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE IN ADDITION TO A MORE TRADITIONAL SPATIAL PERSPECTIVE, WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR FOCUS FROM THE PRODUCTS OF LEGAL CLASSIFICATION TO LEGAL CLASSIFICATION AS A PROCESS. WE CAN THEN EXAMINE THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP OF RELATIVITY BETWEEN LEGAL CONCEPTS AS THEY OPERATE IN CONTEXT, RATHER THAN LIMITING OUR ANALYSIS TO THE STATIC RELATIONSHIP OF DEMARCATION THAT EXISTS WHEN LEGAL CLASSES ARE EXAMINED IN THE ABSTRACT.
393	THE CURRENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOCUSING ON SOUTH-ASIAN COUNTRIES ENTAILING BANGLADESH, BHUTAN, INDIA, NEPAL, PAKISTAN, AND SRI LANKA, FROM 2002 TO 2018. THE DATA ARE ANALYSED USING THE DYNAMIC HETEROGENEOUS PANEL (PANEL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG [ARDL] MODEL) APPROACH, SPECIFICALLY THE DYNAMIC FIXED EFFECT (DFE), MEAN GROUP (MG), AND POOLED MEAN GROUP (PMG). BASED ON THE FINDINGS, THE THREE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, NAMELY CORRUPTION CONTROL, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW, POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALL THE NATIONS HAVE CONSISTENT LONG-RUN ESTIMATES BUT VARIED SHORT-RUN ESTIMATES AND ADJUSTMENT SPEED FOR THE LONG-TERM EQUILIBRIUM. THIS IS DUE TO GOVERNANCE VOLATILITY THAT IS EVIDENT IN ALL THE NATIONS. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS BOTH PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH LITERATURE FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SOUTH-ASIAN PERSPECTIVE. FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE STUDY FINDINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR POLICYMAKERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM THE COUNTRIES THAT DEMONSTRATE MAJOR FISCAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCE DUE TO WAR AND TERRORISM, LOW OIL PRICES AND WEAK TRADE. HENCE, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC GROWTH ISSUES INSTIGATED BY THE POLICYMAKERS' NEGLIGENCE TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE AND MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. REGULATORS CAN IMPROVE ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL IMAGE BUILDING BY DEVELOPING A STABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND MAINTAINING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY BY IMPROVING THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT LEADS TO BETTER ECONOMIC GROWTH.
394	THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH AND QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY DONETSK AREA RESIDENTS WHEN THE AUTHOR VISITED THE CITY JANUARY 7-17, 2014. THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT, AT LEAST AMONG DONBAS AREA RESIDENTS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, THERE WERE POSSIBILITIES FOR BUILDING A "EUROPEAN DREAM" THAT EUROMAIDAN PROTESTERS IN KYIV CHAMPIONED. FIGHTING FOR THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND AN END TO CORRUPTION-VALUES IDENTIFIED WITH THE EUROMAIDAN-COULD HAVE TRANSCENDED UKRAINE'S REGIONAL DIVISIONS. EVEN THOSE SKEPTICAL OF "EUROPEAN VALUES" STILL AGREED THAT THEY BELONGED TO ONE NATION WITH DIFFERING POLITICAL OBJECTIVES. YET THE MANIPULATION OF THE KYIV PROTESTS BY POLITICIANS, OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE IN KYIV, CONTINUED STEREOTYPES OF UKRAINE'S REGIONS, AND COMPLEX ECONOMIC TIES WITH RUSSIA AND EUROPE MADE THIS EUROPEAN DREAM ELUSIVE. ESCALATING VIOLENCE IN JANUARY 2014 AND THE SUDDEN IMPLOSION OF THE REGIME OF VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH THE NEXT MONTH POLARIZED PUBLIC OPINION IN DONETSK. DUE TO MANIPULATIONS BY LOCAL POLITICIANS, PRO-RUSSIAN ACTIVISTS, AND PRO-RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN LOCAL MEDIA, DONETSK RESIDENTS AND OTHERS IN THE DONBAS PROTESTED THE KYIV "JUNTA" AND DEMANDED GREATER RIGHTS FOR THEIR REGION. THE ENSUING GEOPOLITICAL BATTLE BROUGHT ABOUT GREATER RUSSIAN INTERVENTION, BOTH POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY TO RESIST THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF SEPARATIST REPUBLICS. AS PRO-RUSSIAN ACTIVISTS AND ARMED MILITANTS, SOME FROM ACROSS THE RUSSIAN BORDER, TERRORIZED PRO-UKRAINIAN CITIZENS AND EUROMAIDAN ACTIVISTS, THE EUROPEAN DREAM IN DONETSK CAME TO AN END FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
395	THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR CAN BE ENHANCED IN THE LONG-RUN THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THEREBY ENSURING FOOD SECURITY IN NIGERIA. IT EMPLOYS THE ARDL (AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG) WITH DATA FROM THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN) STATISTICAL BULLETIN, FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION (FAO), WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS (WDI), AND WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WDI). FOOD SECURITY IS USED AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE PROXIED BY THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE UNDERNOURISHED UNDER THE STABILITY DIMENSION; AGRICULTURAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, WHILE POPULATION IS A CONTROL VARIABLE. TWO AGRICULTURAL VARIABLES (AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURE CREDIT) ARE EMPLOYED WITH SIX VARIABLES OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT IN THE LOG-RUN, AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURE CREDIT (AGRICULTURE VARIABLES) WILL INCREASE FOOD SECURITY BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNDERNOURISHED BY 2% AND 18%, RESPECTIVELY. IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK; POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE AND RULE OF LAW INCREASE FOOD SECURITY BY REDUCING UNDERNOURISHMENT BY APPROXIMATELY 69% AND 29%, RESPECTIVELY; CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TENDS TO REDUCE FOOD SECURITY BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE UNDERNOURISHED BY 74%, 51% AND 63% RESPECTIVELY. THEREFORE, THE STUDY CONCLUDES BY RECOMMENDING, AMONG OTHERS, THAT THE NIGERIAN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE IMPROVED (ESPECIALLY THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FOOD SECURITY PROGRAMMES AND ENSURING TIMELY DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD RESOURCES.
396	THIS PAPER IS THE SECOND FROM THE "SALON SERIES ON THE CREATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS". THIS WAS A SERIES OF SALONS JOINTLY HOSTED BY TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY'S NGO RESEARCH CENTER, THE PHILANTHROPY AND NGO SUPPORT CENTER, AND THE EDITORIAL OFFICE OF THE CHINA NONPROFIT REVIEW. THE FORMULATION OF A BASIC LAW ON SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR CHINA'S SOCIAL SECTOR, AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION SECTOR. IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR A TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE MANAGED, FROM THE CURRENT FORM OF GOVERNANCE, WHICH IS ACHIEVED THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS, TO MANAGEMENT BY 'RULE OF LAW' IN THE TRUEST SENSE. RECENTLY, IN ACADEMIC CIRCLES, MANY DIFFERENT LINES OF THOUGHT HAVE DEVELOPED ABOUT THE FORMULATION OF A BASIC LAW FOR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE ARGUMENT FOR 'GOVERNANCE THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW', WHICH ADOPTS A PUBLIC LAW PERSPECTIVE; THE ARGUMENT FOR 'SPECIAL CIVIL LAWS', WHICH APPROACHES THE QUESTION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PRIVATE LAW; AND THE ARGUMENT FOR A 'COMBINATION OF LEGAL FORMS'. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CONTENT OF A BASIC LAW, AS WELL AS THE OBJECTIVES, NATURE OF AND SKILLS INVOLVED IN FORMULATING SUCH A LAW. IT EXAMINES THE NECESSITY AND FEASIBILITY OF CREATING SUCH LEGISLATION, AND THE KEY IDEAS THAT NEED TO BE TRANSFORMED DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PAPER CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS AND THE THINKING BEHIND OTHER LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE CHARITY LAW.
397	GOOD GOVERNANCE IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO THE SUCCESS OF PARKS AND PROTECTED AREAS. THIS RESEARCH UTILIZED A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR 10 PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE TO EVALUATE THE OUTSOURCING MODEL USED BY BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCIAL PARKS, WHERE PROFIT-MAKING CORPORATIONS PROVIDE ALL FRONT COUNTRY VISITOR SERVICES. A TOTAL OF 246 RESPONDENTS REPRESENTING FIVE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS EVALUATED THE MODEL ACCORDING TO EACH PRINCIPLE, USING AN ONLINE SURVEY. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS RESULTED IN TWO OF THE 10 PRINCIPLES (EQUITY AND EFFECTIVENESS) EACH BEING SPLIT INTO TWO CATEGORIES, LEADING TO 12 GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES. FIVE OF THE 12 CRITERIA RECEIVED SCORES TOWARDS GOOD GOVERNANCE: EFFECTIVENESS OUTCOME; EQUITY GENERAL; STRATEGIC VISION; RESPONSIVENESS; AND EFFECTIVENESS PROCESS. ONE CRITERION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, WAS ON THE NEUTRAL POINT. SIX CRITERIA RECEIVED SCORES BELOW NEUTRAL, MORE TOWARDS WEAK GOVERNANCE: TRANSPARENCY; RULE OF LAW; ACCOUNTABILITY; EFFICIENCY; CONSENSUS ORIENTATION; AND, EQUITY FINANCE. THE FIVE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY ON 10 OF THE 12 PRINCIPLES (P < .05). THE 2 EXCEPTIONS WERE FOR EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS PROCESS. SEVEN OF THE 12 CRITERIA FOLLOWED A PATTERN WHEREIN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS REPORTED POSITIVE SCORES, VISITORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF NGOS REPORTED MORE NEGATIVE SCORES, AND NEARBY RESIDENTS REPORTED MID-RANGE SCORES. THREE CRITERIA HAD GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS REPORTING THE MOST POSITIVE SCORES, RESIDENTS AND VISITORS THE MOST NEGATIVE SCORES, AND NGO RESPONDENTS REPORTING MID-RANGE SCORES. THIS RESEARCH FOUND EVIDENCE THAT PERCEPTIONS OF GOVERNANCE RELATED TO THIS OUTSOURCING MODEL DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONGST VARIOUS CONSTITUENT GROUPS.
398	NOTWITHSTANDING OF THE CONSIDERABLE BODY INTERNATIONAL LAW DEALING WITH OCCUPATION, IDENTIFICATION OF THE NORMATIVE STANDARDS AGAINST WHICH LAW AND ORDER IS MAINTAINED CONTINUES TO CHALLENGE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THAT CHALLENGE IS CENTERED ON THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNCLEAR AND OFTEN AWKWARD INTERFACE BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. POLICING REPRESENTS THE NORMAL MEANS BY WHICH ORDER IS MAINTAINED IN SOCIETY. IN OCCUPIED TERRITORY THE PREFERENCE SHOULD BE FOR MAINTAINING ORDER BY MEANS OF PROPERLY TRAINED POLICE FORCES SEEKING TO APPLY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW STANDARDS. HOWEVER THE SECURITY THREAT IS OFTEN NOT LIMITED TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WITH THERE BEING STRIKING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN ORDER IN OCCUPIED TERRITORY AND BATTLING INSURGENCIES IN INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS. THIS THEN POINTS TO THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW TO GOVERN THE USE OF FORCE. DESPITE ONGOING DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHICH PARADIGM SHOULD BE APPLIED THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER THE PROPONENTS OF THE TWO FRAMEWORKS CAN BREAK FREE OF THEIR NORMATIVE CHAINS TO CRAFT A REALISTIC APPROACH TO MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER SUGGESTED APPROACHES INCLUDE THE SITUATION BASED APPROACH OF APPLYING THE APPROPRIATE BODY OF LAW TO SPECIFIC FACT SITUATIONS AND THE BLENDED APPROACH OF BORROWING FROM EACH NORMATIVE REGIME TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE SITUATIONS CONFRONTING SECURITY FORCES. WHICH EVER APPROACH IS ADOPTED THE EMPHASIS MUST REMAIN ON THE RIGHT TO LIFE TO ENSURE TRUE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS MAINTAINED.
399	BACKGROUND: GOVERNANCE IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM. GOOD GOVERNANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM LEADS TO BETTER PERFORMANCE AND OUTCOMES. EVALUATION IS THE FIRST STEP TO IMPROVING HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH AIMED TO IDENTIFY EVALUATION TOOLS FOR HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE.METHODS: IN THE CURRENT SCOPING REVIEW, WE SEARCHED ALL DOCUMENTS RELATED TO HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE EVALUATION INDEXED IN MEDLINE, EMBASE, PROQUEST, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCIENCE DIRECT DATABASES, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH ENGINES TO 2022, EXTRACTED, AND ASSESSED. FINALLY, DOCUMENTS WERE SELECTED AND ANALYZED BY THEMATIC ANALYSIS.RESULTS: THIRTY TOOLS WERE FOUND TO EVALUATE HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE. AMONG THE PROPOSED TOOLS, 11 SPECIFIC TOOLS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED JUST FOR HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE EVALUATION, WHILE OTHERS HAVE GOVERNANCE AS A COMPONENT OF HEALTH SYSTEM EVALUATION. HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE'S SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS ARE HEALTH POLICYMAKING, STRATEGIC PLANNING, ORGANIZING, STEWARDSHIP, AND CONTROL. INDICATORS SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY, EQUITY, EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL, EFFECTIVENESS, ETHIC, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SUSTAINABILITY COULD BE USED TO EVALUATE THE HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE.CONCLUSION: DIFFERENT TOOLS HAVE BEEN USED TO EVALUATE GOVERNANCE WORLDWIDE, AND EACH GOVERNANCE EVALUATION TOOL HAS DIFFERENT COMPONENTS SUITABLE FOR GOVERNANCE EVALUATION. HOWEVER, THESE TOOLS CANNOT FULLY EVALUATE GOVERNANCE AND HAVE SHORTCOMINGS. A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF GOVERNANCE AND SHARING LESSONS DENRAEL WILL AFFECT THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S CAPACITY AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE QUALITY, SAFE AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. IT WILL LEAD TO THE STABILITY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM.
400	IN THE RECENT CK TELECOMS (CASE T-399/16) JUDGMENT, THE GENERAL COURT ANNULLED THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S DECISION TO BLOCK THE FOUR-TO-THREE TELECOM MERGER HUTCHISON3G UK/TELEFONICA UK. THIS WATERSHED CASE IS SET TO CURTAIL THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO CHALLENGE FUTURE MERGERS IN CONCENTRATED MARKETS AND PROPOSES A FUNDAMENTAL RESHAPE OF THE ANALYSIS OF UNILATERAL EFFECTS IN THE ABSENCE OF DOMINANCE. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT CK TELECOMS ADVANCES SIX PROPOSITIONS THAT FORM THE FOUNDATION OF A NEW FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF UNILATERAL EFFECTS UNDER THE EU MERGER REGULATION. THIS NEW FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN WELCOMED BY COMMENTATORS AS A LONG-OVERDUE RECOGNITION THAT 'THE LAW' TRUMPS THE COMMISSION'S ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AND AS A VINDICATION OF THE 'MORE ECONOMIC APPROACH'. BASED ON A THOROUGH REVIEW OF 15 YEARS OF MERGER ENFORCEMENT IN THE MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR, THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THIS ACCOUNT BY DEBUNKING BOTH THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND THE 'MORE ECONOMIC APPROACH' ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE NEW FRAMEWORK. IT INSTEAD DEMONSTRATES THAT EACH OF THE SIX PRINCIPLES ADVANCED BY CK TELECOMS NEITHER CONSTITUTES A REAFFIRMATION OF 'THE LAW', NOR ALIGNS EU MERGER ENFORCEMENT WITH THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF UNILATERAL EFFECTS. IN CRITICALLY REFLECTING ON THE NEW FRAMEWORK LAID DOWN IN CK TELECOMS, THIS ARTICLE FORMULATES A NUMBER OF POLICY PROPOSALS AS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FRAME OF REFERENCE THAT WOULD PRESERVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU MERGER ENFORCEMENT IN FUTURE UNILATERAL EFFECTS CASES WHILE ENHANCING LEGAL CERTAINTY.
401	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GLOBAL REFUGEE CRISIS IN THE YEARS 2015-2016, AS REFLECTED AND DRAMATISED THROUGH THE POLEMICAL NOVEL BY AUSTRALIAN AUTHOR JOCK SERONG, ON THE JAVA RIDGE (2017). THIS NOVEL TESTIFIES TO ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING EFFECTS OF GLOBALISATION, NAMELY, THE UNPRECEDENTED SCALE OF POPULATION MOBILITY, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF FAMINE, CLIMATE WARMING, AND WAR CONFLICTS OF ALL KINDS. IN THIS ATMOSPHERE OF ANXIETY AND FEAR, THE UNRELENTING FLOW OF REFUGEES IS SEEN NOT ONLY AS A MENACE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS BUT ALSO AS A DESTABILISING ELEMENT THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE THE COMFORTABLE LIFESTYLE OF FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES. THIS HAS LED MANY GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, TO TAKE MEASURES TO STOP REFUGEES AND ASYLUM-SEEKERS FROM REACHING THEIR SOIL. AS A NUMBER OF CRIMINOLOGISTS SUGGEST, SOME OF THESE MEASURES MIGHT BE REGARDED AS STATE CRIME, AS THEY OFTEN VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE PRETEXT OF REACHING ORGANISATIONAL GOALS. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW SERONG'S NOVEL ILLUSTRATES A NUMBER OF SHADY IMMIGRATION CONTROL MEASURES ALLEGEDLY TAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH, FOLLOWING MICHAEL WELCH'S TERMINOLOGY, CAN FALL INTO TWO MAIN CATEGORIES: "LOUD PANIC/THE WALL OF NOISE" AND "QUIET MANOEUVRING/THE WALL OF GOVERNANCE," WITH A VIEW TO CRITICISING THIS SYSTEM AND URGING RICH COUNTRIES, IN PARTICULAR AUSTRALIA, TO TAKE ACTION ON ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS PLAGUING THE WORLD TODAY.
402	ACCORDING TO ROBERT PUTNAM, TRUST CAN BE A PROXY FOR SOCIAL CAPITAL. THUS, A HIGHER SOCIETAL TRUST COULD BE RELATED TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SIMULATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TRUST AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TWO ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES. ONE ARTIFICIAL SOCIETY (NEW ZEALAND) EXHIBITED HIGHER LEVELS OF INITIAL TRUST, AND THE OTHER (ARGENTINA) HAD LOWER LEVELS OF TRUST. INITIAL STARTING POINTS FOR SIMULATIONS WERE SET USING REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DATA (USING THE GLOBAL TRUST INVENTORY). COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATION RELIED ON A RULE-BASED MODEL (RBM), INTEGRATING TIME THROUGH A STOCHASTIC SIMULATION ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED IN PISKAS. AGENTS IN THE ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES WERE DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO PROPORTIONS OF FOUR TRUST PROFILES, WITH MORE HIGH TRUSTERS (HTS) IN NEW ZEALAND. IN EACH ITERATION, THE AGENTS PLAYED A PRISONER'S DILEMMA, EARNING OR LOSING MONEY ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT PAYOFF MATRICES, COOPERATION PROBABILITIES, AND INTERACTION FREQUENCIES, MODELING DIFFERENT CONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC EXCHANGE. WE ANALYZED THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF EACH COUNTRY, TOGETHER WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH TRUST PROFILE. RESULTS SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT SOCIETIES WITH HIGH TRUST PERFORM ECONOMICALLY BETTER, ON AVERAGE, THAN THOSE WITH LOW TRUST, BUT ONLY IF INTERACTION FREQUENCY IS HELD CONSTANT. DESPITE THE RELEVANCE OF HTS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THEIR PERFORMANCE IS TIGHTLY LINKED TO THE TYPE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY INTERACT: THEY PROSPER MORE IN A RULE OF LAW SOCIETY, AND WHERE HTS ARE MORE COMMON, COMPARED WITH A PREDATORS' PARADISE, WHERE THE SUCKER'S PAYOFF IS MORE PUNITIVE.
403	WHAT ROLE SHOULD RHETORIC PLAY IN FOSTERING 'GOOD GOVERNANCE?' IT HAS TO PLAY A BIG ROLE, IF ONE REGARDS RHETORIC IN THE ARISTOTELIAN SENSE AS 'THE FACULTY (ABILITY) OF OBSERVING IN ANY GIVEN CASE THE AVAILABLE MEANS OF PERSUASION,' (ARI. RHETORIC 1355B. 26) AND IF ONE ACCEPTS THAT PERSUASION (AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FORCE AND VIOLENCE) UNDERPINS THE GOVERNING PROCESS IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE. THE FOCUS IS ON THE ARTISTIC PROOF OF ETHOS AS AN ETHICAL PROOF WHICH CONSISTS OF A RHETOR'S CREDIBILITY THAT IS DERIVED FROM HIS/HER SEEMING EXPERTNESS, TRUSTWORTHINESS, AND GOODWILL TOWARDS AUDIENCES AS REFLECTED IN HIS/HER PUBLIC (POLITICAL) STATEMENTS. PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC IN POST-APARTHEID GOVERNANCE IS DESCRIBED THROUGH THE LENS OF KEY WORDS AND PHRASES TYPIFYING AND DIRECTING THE MANDELA, MBEKI AND ZUMA TERMS OF OFFICE. A QUALITATIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH IS ADOPTED. METHODOLOGICALLY, THE RESEARCH IS AN EXERCISE IN RHETORICAL CRITICISM IN THAT SUCH RESEARCH COMBINES CLOSE READING WITH CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS THAT LEAD TO NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT (A) THE SHIFTING PATTERNS IN DIRECTED PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC IN POST-APARTHEID GOVERNANCE REPRESENT A COMMITMENT TO A NON-RACIAL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY (UNDER MANDELA) TO AFRICAN NATIONALISM (UNDER MBEKI) AND TO BLACK AFRICANISM/NATIONALISM (UNDER ZUMA); AND (B) THE PROMISE OF RHETORIC FOR 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' INCLUDES PRESIDENTIAL RHETORIC MARKED BY CREDIBILITY (ETHOS) THAT ENCAPSULATES EXPERTNESS (THROUGH EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY AND STRATEGIC VISION); TRUSTWORTHINESS (THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, A CONSENSUS ORIENTATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY); AND GOODWILL (THROUGH PARTICIPATION, RESPONSIVENESS AND EQUITY).
404	SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OF THE UNIVERSAL FUNDAMENTAL NORM OF LAW (UFNL) IS PART OF THE NORMATIVE THEORY OF LAW. IN A BROADER SENSE ITS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE ESSENCE, NATURE AND FOUNDATION OF LEGAL NORMS. IN A NARROWER SENSE UFNL RESEARCH CAN BE CLASSIFIED IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL DOGMATICS, THE REASON BEING THAT ITS THEORETICAL RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE UFNL WHERE IT ALSO DRAWS ITS ANSWERS FROM. PREMISES ARE ONLY EXPLAINED, NOT QUESTIONED, WHILE ARGUMENTATION IS NOT BACKED FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES BUT REMAINS WITHIN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. IN THIS FRAME OF LEGAL THEORY, LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND LEGAL THEOLOGY THE LAW AS SUCH IS BEING REEXAMINED. SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF LEGAL METHODOLOGY AND LEGAL ARGUMENTATION ARE USED TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS PARTICULAR SCIENTIFIC FIELD OF THE METAPHYSICS OF LAW CANNOT BE PROVED DEFINITIVELY WITH MERE EMPIRICAL METHODS AND A SOMEWHAT SUBJECTIVE EXPLANATION CANNOT BE ALTOGETHER AVOIDED. PROVING THE ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF THE UFNL IS NOT A REALISTIC GOAL OF ITS RESEARCH, BUT RATHER A SERIOUS CONTRIBUTION TO THE LEGAL AND THEOLOGICAL SCIENCES. FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN FIELDS OF LEGAL THEORY, LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND LEGAL THEOLOGY, A PLURALISM OF CONCURRENT NATURAL LAW THEORIES IS WELCOMED. TO IMPLEMENT THIS PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE, A DEMOCRATIC AND PLURAL STATE, UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, GIVES ITS CITIZENS A RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH, WHICH BOTH CONSTITUTE THE FOUNDATION OF ANY FREE SOCIETY.
405	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN ITS LIBERAL FORM, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS NO FUTURE AS IT CANNOT ENCOMPASS STRUCTURAL INJUSTICES ARISING FROM ISSUES RELATED TO POSTCOLONIAL LAND CONFLICTS. THE BIAS OF LIBERAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE DISCOURSE TOWARDS CORRECTIVE AND RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE INVITES CRITICISM THAT IT IS A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH 'UNCIVILIZED' ROGUE STATES. IN ADDITION, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE'S LIBERAL INDIVIDUALISM OVERLOOKS PLURALISTIC ARRANGEMENTS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS WHICH WERE SECURED BY COLONIALISM. LIBERAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS ALSO TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT POSTCOLONIAL STATES DID NOT START FROM A 'VEIL OF IGNORANCE' AND AS SUCH CANNOT PRESUME THAT LIBERTY HAS TO TAKE PRIMACY OVER REDISTRIBUTION. NONETHELESS, THE ARTICLE ALSO CONTENDS THAT THE CONTINUUM OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CAN BE ASSURED IF THERE IS A SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH RECENT POSTCOLONIAL INNOVATION WHICH IS 'MIMICRY' OF THE DOMINANT DISCOURSE. THE ARTICLE'S USE OF THE CONCEPT OF 'MIMICRY' IS INSPIRED BY THE TERM'S USE IN POSTCOLONIAL AND COLONIAL LITERATURE TO DESCRIBE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF COLONIZED PEOPLE AND THEIR COLONIZERS. IN THE CONTEXT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, MIMICRY CAN BE SHAMEFUL, EMPOWERING AND SUBVERSIVE AS IT INCLUDES THE SHAMELESS COPYING OF FORMER COLONIZERS' TACTICS BY THE POSTCOLONIAL RULING ELITE AND THE DIFFUSION OF 'WESTERN' CONCEPTS OF RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ALSO PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES FOR POSTCOLONIAL 'AGENCY.' POSTCOLONIAL 'AGENCY' OCCURS WHERE POSTCOLONIAL SOCIETIES MERGE LIBERALISM WITH POSTCOLONIAL REALITIES, THEREBY RESPONDING TO THESE SOCIETIES' ACTUALITIES WITHOUT COMPLETELY DISAVOWING INTERNATIONAL LAW.
406	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CHOICE-OF-LAW QUESTION OF WHETHER A SAME-SEX COUPLE, MARRIED IN HAWAII AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE BAEHR V. LEWIN CASE, WILL HAVE THEIR MARRIAGE RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE OF THEIR DOMICILE UPON THEIR RETURN FROM HAWAII. THIS ARTICLE FIRST APPLAUDS THE BAEHR COURT'S DECISION THAT PROHIBITING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL SEX DISCRIMINATION BUT THEN CRITIQUES ITS DECISION THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY DOES NOT EXTEND TO SAME-SEX COUPLES. THE SECOND PART CONSIDERS THE CHOICE-OF-LAW QUESTIONS THAT WILL ARISE IN CASES LITIGATING THE VALIDITY OF A COUPLE'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE UPON THEIR RETURN TO THEIR DOMICILE. IT CONSIDERS STATUTORY DIRECTIVES, SUCH AS MARRIAGE VALIDATION AND EVASION STATUTES, AND SURVEYS THE MAJOR CHOICE-OF-LAW THEORIES IN USE TODAY. GIVEN THE JUDICIAL DISCRETION WHETHER TO RECOGNIZE THESE MARRIAGES, THE THIRD PART ARGUES THAT JUDGES SHOULD RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGES USING THE BETTER RULE OF LAW METHODOLOGY. RECOGNIZING THESE MARRIAGES IS ''BETTER'' BECAUSE IT WOULD END AGE-OLD DISCRIMINATION BASED ON PREJUDICE AND MISUNDERSTANDING, AND WOULD ELIMINATE OVERZEALOUS STATE INTERFERENCE WITH AND CONDEMNATION OF A MOST PERSONAL AND INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP. THIS ARTICLE ANALOGIZES FROM CHOICE-OF-LAW CASES WHICH AROSE DURING THE REIGN OF ANTI-MISCEGENATION STATUTES TO ARGUE THAT THE POST-BAEHR CASES WILL EXPOSE THE INHERENT DISCRIMINATION THAT UNDERLIES THE PROHIBITION OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND ARGUES FOR USING CHOICE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES TO END THAT DISCRIMINATION.
407	TH E PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONCEPTUALIZE TRUST AS A PRIVATE GOOD. THIS PURPOSE IS RELEVANT BECAUSE TODAY SOCIAL CAPITAL IS SIMULTANEOUSLY STUDIED IN FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PARADIGMS AS PRIVATE AND AS PUBLIC GOOD. AS A RESULT, WE CANNOT GET A CLEAR DEFINITION OF SOCIAL CAPITAL. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS DUALITY IS THAT THE KEY ELEMENT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL, I. E. TRUST, IS STUDIED IN DIFFERENT PARADIGMS. THE RULE OF LAW AND PERSONAL REPUTATION CREATE TRUST IN A PERSON, BUT THE FORMER IS USUALLY CONSIDERED THE PROPERTY OF SOCIETY, AND THE LATTER IS USUALLY CONSIDERED THE PROPERTY OF A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. IN THIS LIGHT, THE QUESTION OF THE POSSIBILITY TO CONCEPTUALIZE TRUST EXCLUSIVELY IN ONE OF THE PARADIGMS BECOMES RELEVANT. FIRST, THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES HIS CONCEPT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL, DEFINES TRUST AND DESCRIBES ITS ROLE IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL. TRUST SOURCES ARE THEN DIVIDED INTO THREE TYPES: SUBJECT PROPERTIES, OBJECT PROPERTIES, AND CONTEXT PROPERTIES. ON THIS BASIS, THREE PURE TYPES OF TRUST ARE DISTINGUISHED (BASELINE, PERSONAL, COLLECTIVE) AND A COMPOSITE ONE (CATEGORICAL). FURTHER, THEY ARE TIED TO A SPECIFIC SOCIAL UNIT WITH THE HELP OF AN AUXILIARY CONCEPT OF THE COLLECTIVE, THUS DEMONSTRATING FUNDAMENTAL POSSIBILITY OF CONCEPTUALIZING TRUST AS A PRIVATE GOOD. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN CREATING TRUST, WHICH THE AUTHOR DEEMS TO CONSIDER AS PROPERTIES OF A COLLECTIVE. IN CONCLUSION, THE LOGIC OF CONVERTING TYPES OF TRUST INTO EACH OTHER IS DESCRIBED.
408	THE CHALLENGE TO THINK ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW THEOLOGICALLY IS ASSUMED BY THE SWISS-BRAZILIAN THEOLOGIAN RUDOLF VON SINNER, WHO FAVORS CITIZENSHIP AS A KEY CONCEPT FOR HIS APPROACH. SINNER'S PROPOSAL OF A THEOLOGY OF CITIZENSHIP AS PUBLIC THEOLOGY FOR THE BRAZILIAN CONTEXT IS STRUCTURED ON FIVE PILLARS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MORE SOLIDARY AND FAIR PUBLIC SPACE, DRAWING FROM THEOLOGICAL SOURCES WITHOUT IMPOSING A PRIVATE ECCLESIASTICAL AGENDA, BUT, INSTEAD, RECOGNIZES ELEMENTS THAT MAY HELP TO THINK ABOUT PUBLIC ISSUES IN THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION, THE LUTHERAN ESPECIALLY. TO BE A CHRISTIAN CITIZEN, THE MOST THEOLOGICAL PILLAR, IS IN CORRELATION WITH THE TASK TO BE, LIVE, PERSEVERE AND SERVE AS A CITIZEN. THE AUTHOR MAKES USE OF THEOLOGICAL TOPICS SUCH AS GRACE, IMAGO DEI, JUSTIFICATION BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH, SIMUL IUSTUS ET PECCATOR, AS WELL AS THE QUESTION OF THE TWO REGIMENTS WITH THE GOAL OF SHAPING HIS PROPOSITION OF A CITIZEN PRESENCE IN THE WORLD THAT IS THEOLOGICALLY INFORMED AND ACTIVE IN LOVELY AND FREE SERVICE TO OTHERS. HENCE, RUDOLF VON SINNER AIMS TO QUALIFY THE CHRISTIAN PRESENCE AND INCIDENCE IN PUBLIC LIFE, SO THAT CHRISTIAN CHURCHES, PROVOKED BY THE GOSPEL THEY CONFESS, MAY PURSUE A CITIZENSHIP IN FAVOR OF OTHER PEOPLE, ABOVE ALL THE ONES WHO SUFFER THE MOST, NOT LEGISLATING FOR THEIR OWN CAUSE, BUT, WITH BOLDNESS AND HUMILITY, DENOUNCING INJUSTICES WHILE STRUGGLING FOR THE EFFECTIVE CONSOLIDATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES.
409	ALREADY IN 2003, THE EU COMMISSION PRESENTED A DRAFT DIRECTIVE FOR ACCESS TO COURTS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, WHICH WAS MEANT, ABOVE ALL, TO SERVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AARHUS CONVENTION (AC) RATIFIED BOTH BY THE EU AND ALSO BY GERMANY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CONVENTION IS, AMONGST OTHER THINGS, TO SECURE ACCESS TO THE COURTS. THIS IS TO BE GUARANTEED BOTH BY THE ACCESS OF THE "MEMBERS OF THE AFFECTED PUBLIC" AND ALSO THE ACCESS OF THE "MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC". THE LATTER IS TO BE REGULATED IN MORE DETAIL BY THE DRAFT DIRECTIVE PRESENTED IN 2003. THE DRAFT, HOWEVER, FACED STRONG RESERVATIONS ON THE SIDE OF THE MEMBER STATES AND HAS SUBSEQUENTLY NOT YET BEEN RATIFIED. IN THE MEANTIME, THE TOPIC "ACCESS TO THE COURTS" REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS HAS GAINED TOPICALITY DUE TO THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE BUNDESVERWAL-TUNGSGERICHT [GERMAN, FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE COURT], AS WELL AS THE CONSULTATION PROCESS INITIATED BY THE EU COMMISSION IN JULY 2013 TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE COURTS. ACCESS TO THE COURTS IS WITHOUT DOUBT AN ESSENTIAL PILLAR OF DEMOCRATIC STATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, MEANWHILE A HIGH LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND POSSIBILITIES FOR COURT ACTION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN FAVOUR OF THE ENVIRONMENT DUE TO LAW-MAKING AND IN PARTICULAR ALSO THE ECOJ JURISDICTION. MEASURES TOWARD ACTIO POPULARIS THROUGH LEGISLATIVE OR JUDICIARY ACTION COULD HOWEVER CONSTITUTE A COMPLETELY MISGUIDED APPROACH.
410	IN HIS BOOK CONSTITUTIONALIZING ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT RULES AND CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. HE BEGINS BY EXAMINING THE LEGAL AND IDEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT RULES, SHOWING HOW KEY CONCEPTS UNDER THE TREATIES ORIGINATE IN SOME (BUT NOT ALL) DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONS. HE SHOWS ALSO HOW THE REGIME HAS SERVED AS A VEHICLE FOR ARBITRATORS TO RATCHET UP THE IMPOSITION OF INTERNATIONAL DISCIPLINE ON STATES. SCHNEIDERMAN REVIEWS CASE STUDIES SHOWING THE IMPACT OF THE RULES ON GOVERNMENTS. HE ALSO IDENTIFIES HOW ARBITRATORS HAVE INTERPRETED INVESTMENT TREATIES IN WAYS THAT TAKE CONSTITUTIONALIST NOTIONS OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT BEYOND THEIR DOMESTIC TRAJECTORIES AND THAT PROMOTE VERSIONS OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' WITH A DISTINCTLY NEO-LIBERAL BENT. IRONICALLY, THE PORTRAYAL OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION AS AN INSTITUTIONAL HAMMER OF NEO-LIBERALISM THAT IS JUST NOW HITTING ITS NAILS COINCIDES WITH A RESURGENT KEYNESIANISM AND RENEWED REGULATION AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL. MY MAIN CRITICISM OF THE BOOK IS THAT ITS CLAIM OF 'CONSTITUTIONALIZATION' IS OPEN TO DOUBT GIVEN THAT (1) THE TREATIES CAN BE ABROGATED, (2) THE TREATIES LACK THE NORMATIVE POWER OF DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONS, AND (3) INVESTMENT ARBITRATION LACKS INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF A LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. IS THE SYSTEM CONSTITUTIONAL OR MERELY NEO-LIBERAL? NEVERTHELESS, SCHNEIDERMAN OFFERS POWERFUL INSIGHTS ON THE CAPACITY FOR ALTERNATIVE VISIONS AND RESISTANCE. IT IS ALSO REFRESHING TO SEE SCHNEIDERMAN FOCUS ON NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR POWER TO UNDO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN DONE.
411	THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS ON TOURISM DEVELOPMENT IN A PANEL OF 27 COUNTRIES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE PERIOD OF 2008-2021. THE NUMBER OF ARRIVALS AND EMPLOYEES IN TOURISM MEASURES TOURISM DEVELOPMENT. THE CONTROL VARIABLES USED, WHICH ALSO REPRESENT THE DETERMINANTS OF TOURISM, ARE GDP GROWTH RATE PER CAPITA, INFLATION, HIGHER EDUCATION, QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND TRADE. QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS INDEXES ARE CONSTRUCTED BASED ON INDICATORS OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF SELECTED DETERMINANTS IN TOURISM DEVELOPMENT, WE USED THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF THE MOMENTS-GMM MODEL. ACCORDING TO THE OBTAINED RESULTS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND TOURISM. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH SHOULD PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS AND EXPLAIN THEIR INFLUENCE ON EVENTS IN TOURISM. ALL OF THE ABOVE KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE MANAGEMENT BODIES IN CHARGE OF CREATING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH IS REFLECTED IN THE CLARIFICATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY AND MONITORING. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC TOURIST REGIONS OR IS BASED ON SMALLER INDICATORS. THIS PAPER COVERS THE AREA OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WITH DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND SHARE IN TOURIST TRAFFIC.
412	THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL HAS A COMPLEX STRUCTURE, BECAUSE SECURING THIS RIGHT IS BOTH A GOAL, OR A STATE'S POSITIVE COMMITMENT TO ENSURING CITIZENS' RIGHTS, AND A MEANS OF ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. THE OBLIGATION TO TELL THE TRUTH AS A PRINCIPLE OF PROCEDURE CONSTITUTES THE CORE OF A FAIR TRIAL. THE CONCEPT OF 'FAIR TRIAL' WOULD BE A MERE FICTION IF THE STATE WOULD NOT DEMAND THAT PARTIES TO THE CASE TELL THE TRUTH IN PROCEEDINGS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT A DISPUTE CAN BE SOLVED IN RELIANCE ON TRUE FACTS, TRUE STATEMENTS. THIS IS A PRE-REQUISITE FOR THE LEGAL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES, WHICH MEANS CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY AS AN ELEMENT OF STATE'S SUSTAINABILITY IN THE LONG RUN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE SCOPE OF THE OBLIGATION TO TELL THE TRUTH IN PROCEDURAL RELATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEED FOR THE FAIR SETTLEMENT OF LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF SOCIETY IN ORDER TO FORMULATE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE LEGISLATION, THEREBY MINIMISING OPPORTUNITIES TO AVOID THE TRUTH FOR THE PARTIES TO PROCEEDINGS. THE RESEARCH HAS EMPLOYED DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL, DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE METHODS. THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN USED TO ANALYSE LAWS AND THE OPINIONS OF LEGAL SCHOLARS AND FORMULATE CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.
413	POLITICAL TRANSITION THEORY HAS CLEAR INDICATORS FOR SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIZATION, INCLUDING THE TWO-TURNOVER TEST IN ELECTIONS, RULE OF LAW, PRESS FREEDOM AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM. HOWEVER, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SYSTEM CHANGE AND REGIME CHANGE REMAINS AMBIGUOUS. AFTER RAPID POLITICAL TRANSITIONS FROM AUTHORITARIAN TO DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS, OLD GUARD ELITES SEEK TO RECAPTURE POWER AND PROTECT THEIR WEALTH IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES. THE AUTHORS CHARACTERIZE THIS AS A PROCESS OF DYNASTIC REGIME RECOVERY, WITH ELITE NETWORKS SEEKING TO CONTROL DISCURSIVE SPACES AS PART OF A BROADER STRATEGY TO REGAIN POLITICAL POWER AND LEGITIMACY. POLITICAL DISTORTIONS PERSIST IN RAPID TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY, AND THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH INTERLOCKING ELITES FROM THE SUHARTO ERA STRATEGICALLY ADAPTED TO INDONESIA'S COMPETITIVE MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM. THE AUTHORS GATHERED DATA FROM 21 INTERVIEWS WITH THE SUHARTO FAMILY AND THEIR ASSOCIATES, AS WELL AS OBSERVATIONS FROM AN EXCLUSIVE COMMEMORATIVE EVENT CELEBRATING THE CENTENARY OF SUHARTO'S BIRTH IN JUNE 2021. THE CENTENARY CELEBRATION WAS A NETWORK-LED REVANCHIST EFFORT TO PROMOTE A POSITIVE NARRATIVE ABOUT SUHARTO'S PRESIDENCY, AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF A COMPLEX REGIME RECOVERY STRATEGY. THE 2022 ELECTION OF FERDINAND "BONGBONG" MARCOS JR. IN THE PHILIPPINES INDICATES THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REHABILITATION OF FORMERLY DISCREDITED POLITICAL DYNASTIES. THE RECOVERY OF THE SUHARTO FAMILY LEGACY, BUSINESS NETWORKS AND POLITICAL PARTY COALITIONS HAS YET TO ENSURE INSTITUTIONAL RECAPTURE OR ELECTORAL VICTORY, BUT IT IS TOO SOON TO WRITE A DEFINITIVE POLITICAL OBITUARY.
414	FROM 1974 TO 1986 THE IBERIAN PENINSULA WAS THE ARENA OF MAJOR POLITICAL CHANGES. THE PROCESS THEN UNDERTAKEN WAS CHARACTERIZED BY THE TRANSITION FROM TWO IBERIAN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO TWO DEMOCRACIES, WHICH ENABLED BOTH COUNTRIES TO JOIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EEC) ON 1 JANUARY 1986. HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL VICISSITUDES UNTIL FULL MEMBERSHIP OF WHAT BECAME THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) WAS ACHIEVED WERE VERY DIFFERENT AND WERE DECISIVELY, ALTHOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY, INFLUENCED BY THE FACT PORTUGAL WAS A REPUBLIC AND SPAIN A MONARCHY. IN PORTUGAL THE 1974 REVOLUTION TOOK PLACE WITH CONSEQUENT SHIFT OF THE HEAD OF STATE WHILE IN SPAIN THE ENGINE OF CHANGE WAS PRECISELY THE HEAD OF STATE: KING JUAN CARLOS I. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT DESPITE THE DANGERS TO DEMOCRACY (TERRORISM IN SPAIN AND SOME RADICALISM IN PORTUGAL) BOTH SOCIETIES SUPPORTED THE POLITICAL PARTIES COMMITTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN ELECTIONS, WHICH HELPED AVOID TENSIONS THAT COULD HAVE DEFEATED THE PROCESS. LIKEWISE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT IN SPAIN A PLAN TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW (AN ARCHETYPAL TRANSITION) WAS DESIGNED BY THE HEAD OF STATE, WHILE IN PORTUGAL THERE WAS NO PRE-ESTABLISHED PLAN - THE PROGRAMME OF THE ARMED FORCES MOVEMENT (MOVIMENTO DAS FORCAS ARMADAS [MFA]) WAS A WEAK AND PRECARIOUS COMPROMISE BETWEEN DIFFERENT VISIONS OF THE ROAD TO FOLLOW, ENABLING AN INTENSE POLITICAL STRUGGLE THAT ALMOST LED TO CIVIL WAR AND A DANGEROUS STATE OF CRISIS.
415	IDEAS EXPRESSED AS LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORIES HAVE SOUGHT TO CONNECT LAW AND DEVELOPMENT BY CREATING A FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE ROLE OF LAW IN DEVELOPMENT MAY BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND PERHAPS EVEN PACKAGED AS A KIT TO BE RECOMMENDED TO GOVERNMENTS AS A WAY OF ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT. OVER THE YEARS, THOUGHTS ON LAW AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE CRYSTALLISED AROUND VARIOUS CONCEPTS SUCH AS ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE RULE OF LAW, THE EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR AND THE GROWTH OF INSTITUTIONS. ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT CLEARLY FROM THESE DEBATES IS THAT WHILE THERE MAY BE A MEASURE OF CONSENSUS AROUND PARTICULAR THESES OR PROPOSITIONS, UNANIMITY AMONG ALL THINKERS, SCHOLARS AND ACTORS IS NOT LIKELY TO FOLLOW, NOR IS IT NECESSARILY DESIRABLE. THIS PAPER DRAWS OUT THREADS OF THOUGHT THAT PRESENT VARIOUS POSITIONS AS FACETS OF THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT DYNAMIC AND AT THE SAME TIME, PROGRESSIVE POINTS ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUUM. THE FIRST SECTION ON THE PROGRESSION OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SUMMARISES A NUMBER OF THEMES AT THE FOREFRONT OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORISATION OVER THE YEARS. REFLECTIONS ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS FOLLOW IN THE SECOND SEGMENT, WHILE A THIRD SEGMENT DESCRIBES VARIOUS CONTEXTS FOR ENGAGING WITH LAW AND DEVELOPMENT STUDIES. THIS SEGMENT, WHICH LEADS INTO THE CONCLUSION, HIGHLIGHTS SOME KEY DIMENSIONS OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THOUGHT THAT NEED TO BE FURTHER EXPLORED AND GIVEN A PLACE IN THE TAXONOMY OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARSHIP.
416	WHILE A COURT MUST RESPECT THE SPHERE OF DECISION- MAKING AUTONOMY PROPERLY ENJOYED BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY, A GENERAL DOCTRINE OF DEFERENCE IS UNLIKELY TO FURNISH A USEFUL MEANS OF DEFINING THE LIMITS OF THE COURT'S JURISDICTION. THE APPROPRIATE DEGREE OF JUDICIAL DEFERENCE IS DEPENDENT ON ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES: THE CORRECT BALANCE BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST IS A FEATURE OF THE CONTEXT IN WHICH A SPECIFIC LEGAL ISSUE ARISES. A DOCTRINE OF DEFERENCE IS RENDERED OTIOSE BY APPLICATION OF THE ORDINARY COMMON LAW GROUNDS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHEREBY THE DECISION OF A PUBLIC AUTHORITY IS SUBJECTED TO A TEST OF PROCEDURAL RECTITUDE. THE LEGITIMACY OF AN EXECUTIVE DECISION IS A FUNCTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE PROCESS THAT LED TO IT, IN WHICH RIGHTS ARE ACCORDED AN IMPORTANCE COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR TRUE WEIGHT IN ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WEDNESBURY UNREASONABLENESS, CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD, CONSTITUTES A CONTROL OVER PROCESS ADAPTABLE TO CONTEXT AND CIRCUMSTANCE. THE RULE OF LAW IMPOSES CONSTRAINTS OF EQUALITY AND DUE PROCESS, AND IN THE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT THE FORMER PRINCIPLE IS PARAMOUNT. STATUTES MUST BE INTERPRETED AS CONFORMING TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, SO THAT BASIC RIGHTS ARE NOT UNJUSTIFIABLY CURTAILED. LEGISLATION SHOULD NOT BE HELD INVALID, OR DEFECTIVE, WHEN CAPABLE OF A SUITABLY BENIGN CONSTRUCTION, CONSISTENT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A CONSTRUCTION THAT RECONCILES LEGITIMATE PUBLIC PURPOSES AND ESTABLISHED BASIC RIGHTS, ACCORDING TO CONTEXT; AND COURTS ARE ONLY RARELY JUSTIFIED IN ABDICATING THAT RESPONSIBILITY.
417	THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF BIG DATA IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE HAS POSED UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES CONCERNING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, EQUITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. AS BIG DATA ESTABLISHES ITSELF AS A RESOURCE OF GROWING VALUE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL CHALLENGES: DATA SUSTAINABILITY. DATA SUSTAINABILITY INVOLVES SOCIAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE CORRECT USE OF PERSONAL DATA. LACK OF INFORMED CONSENT AND TRANSPARENCY IN COLLECTING AND USING PERSONAL DATA RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING PRIVACY AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IT IS NECESSARY TO DEFINE REGULATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICIES THAT GUARANTEE CITIZENS' DIGITAL RIGHTS BASED ON ETHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS ASSOCIATED WITH DATA MANAGEMENT. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO REVIEW THE LITERATURE IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA SUSTAINABILITY TO IDENTIFY HOW BIG DATA IS USED, PARTICULARLY EMPHASIZING ITS APPLICATION IN THE POLICY DOMAIN AND THE CHALLENGES IT POSES FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, EQUITY, AND LAW. WE HAVE USED SYSTEMATIC MAPPING METHODOLOGY TO COLLECT RELEVANT PAPERS, FINDING 28 PAPERS ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND BIG DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF DATA SUSTAINABILITY. FROM THE REVIEW OF THESE PAPERS, THERE APPEARS TO BE A LACK OF PROPOSALS FOCUSING ON APPLYING OR IMPLEMENTING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND BIG DATA. FURTHERMORE, THERE SEEM TO BE NO MEASURES TO ASSESS THE APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. FROM THESE, THE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS THE DEFINITION OF FORMAL MODELS THAT INTEGRATE BIG DATA PRACTICES IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IS IDENTIFIED.
418	ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD IS THE DIFFERENTIATION OF CIVIL PROCEEDINGS, IN PARTICULAR, THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF VARIOUS SIMPLIFIED PROCEEDINGS. THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH PROCEDURES FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF SMALL CLAIMS WAS RECOMMENDED IN A NUMBER OF COUNCIL OF EUROPE DOCUMENTS AND WAS SEEN AS A WAY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE COURT. IN UKRAINE, THESE TRENDS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF SIMPLIFIED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SMALL CASES IN 2017 AS NOVELTIES OF CIVIL PROCEEDINGS. DOES THE CIVIL PROCEDURE INSTITUTION OF SMALL CLAIMS COMPLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF UKRAINE? DOES THE CIVIL PROCEDURE INSTITUTE OF SMALL CLAIMS HINDER THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION? WHETHER THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPORTIONALITIES ARE DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH 1.5 OF PART 6 OF ART. 19 OF THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE OF UKRAINE, THE VALUE OF THE CLAIM FOR THE QUALIFICATION OF CASES IS INSIGNIFICANT. THE AUTHORS TRIED TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, JUSTIFYING THIS BY ANALYZING THE LEGISLATION OF DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE CONCLUSIONS JUSTIFIED THE NEED TO PUBLISH A FORMULA FOR DETERMINING A SMALL CLAIMS WITH REFERENCE TO THE LEVEL OF MINIMUM INCOME IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY.
419	OBJECTIVE/CONTEXT: PEOPLE USUALLY ASSOCIATE DEMOCRACY WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF VALUES AND DESIRABLE OUTCOMES. AN INFORMED UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, REQUIRES THAT THE PUBLIC BE AWARE THAT DEMOCRACY IS A REGIME IN WHICH ELECTIONS ARE FREE AND FAIR, THE GOVERNMENT IS BOUND BY THE RULE OF LAW, AND CITIZENS HAVE EQUAL POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL FREEDOMS. THIS ARTICLE IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE SCHOLARSHIP ON THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY AS A LIBERAL-ELECTORAL REGIME. THE CENTRAL CLAIM IS THAT AN INFORMED NOTION OF DEMOCRACY REINFORCES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEPTION OF INTEGRITY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS AS A CORE INSTITUTION IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. METHODOLOGY: USING SURVEY DATA, THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE CASE OF MEXICO, WHERE SEVERAL OBSERVERS IDENTIFY A CRUCIAL PUZZLE: VOTERS SYSTEMATICALLY DISTRUST ELECTIONS THAT ARE WIDELY REGARDED AS FREE AND FAIR. THE ANALYSIS IS REPLICATED IN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES AS WELL. CONCLUSIONS: AS WOULD BE EXPECTED, VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TRUST ELECTIONS WHEN THEY PERCEIVE THAT BALLOTS ARE COUNTED FAIRLY, ELECTORAL OFFICIALS ARE HONEST, MEDIA COVERAGE IS BALANCED, OR WOMEN HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO RUN FOR OFFICE. THE RESULTS CONFIRM, FURTHERMORE, THAT PERCEPTION OF ELECTORAL INTEGRITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF TRUST IN ELECTIONS ON THE CONDITION THAT VOTERS UNDERSTAND DEMOCRACY AS A LIBERAL REGIME. ORIGINALITY: THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY ENHANCES CITIZENS' ABILITIES TO APPRECIATE THE LINK BETWEEN ELECTORAL INTEGRITY AND THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ELECTIONS.
420	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF PERCEPTIONS OF AN EMERGENT CRISIS OF FLOOD RISK FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS IN JAKARTA. JAKARTA FACES DEVASTATING FUTURE FLOODS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS, AND THE CITY HAS EXPERIENCED SEVERE FLOOD EVENTS IN RECENT YEARS. STATE ACTORS HAVE RESPONDED WITH AN AGGRESSIVE INFRASTRUCTURAL AGENDA THAT HAS LED TO EVICTIONS OF NUMEROUS LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES. THIS HAS SPURRED A SERIES OF COURT CASES, IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE EVICTIONS VIOLATED INDONESIAN LAW AND SPECIFICALLY VIOLATED LEGAL PROTECTIONS OF AUTOCHTHONOUS LAND CLAIMS. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF COURT AND POLICY DOCUMENTS AND INTERVIEWS WITH KEY ACTORS, THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT JAKARTA'S CRISIS OF FLOOD RISK HAS INTENSIFIED WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE DIALECTIC OF STATE INFORMALITY AND HAS BROUGHT THIS DYNAMIC TO THE CENTER OF URBAN POLITICS. THIS DIALECTIC IS DEFINED BY CONTESTATION BETWEEN TWO DEEPLY ANTAGONISTIC FRAMEWORKS OF PLANNING ACTION. ON ONE HAND, STATE ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS ASSERT THEIR RIGHT TO UNILATERALLY DEFINE WHAT IS LEGITIMATE AND JUST, AND INDEED TO VIOLATE THEIR OWN LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHERE THEY SEE FIT, AS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS SOCIETAL RISK. ON THE OTHER, COMMUNITIES AND ADVOCATES ARGUE THAT THIS ASSERTION OF STATE POWER HAS LED TO THE SYSTEMATIC DELEGITIMATION AND STIGMATIZATION OF COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT ACCORD WITH STATE DEVELOPMENTAL VISIONS. THIS CRITIQUE PARADOXICALLY POSITIONS INFORMALIZED COMMUNITIES AS PROPONENTS OF THE REASSERTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PRACTICE OF URBAN PLANNING.
421	GOOD GOVERNANCE, A KEY CONCEPT OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, INTEGRATES AND COORDINATES GOVERNMENTAL AND MANAGERIAL SETS AND ALL RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT IT CAN PROVIDE REFORMS TO IMPROVE THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF ALL CITIZENS. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN RAISED FREQUENTLY IN MODERN PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, BUT IT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLAIN GOOD GOVERNANCE IN IRAN'S HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY USED INDUCTIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 10 EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH. THE STUDY METHOD WAS PURPOSIVE. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA. THE FINDINGS WERE ANALYZED USING MAXQDA (R) 11 SOFTWARE. THIS RESEARCH, 10 COMPONENTS (DIMENSIONS) AND 55 SUB-COMPONENTS (FACTORS) OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM WERE EXPLAINED. THE DIMENSIONS WERE: PARTICIPATION, RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, EQUITY, EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, RESPONSIVENESS, CONSENSUS ORIENTATION, HEALTH ORIENTATION, AND DECENTRALIZATION. IRAN'S HEALTH SYSTEM HAS UNDERGONE PROFOUND CHANGES OVER THE PAST DECADES, BUT IT IS FACED WITH MANY CHALLENGES REGARDING GOOD HEALTH GOVERNANCE. THE LACK OF DECENTRALIZATION AND CONSENSUS BETWEEN INTRASECTORAL AND INTERSECTORAL INSTITUTIONS, LACK OF STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION IN POLICY AND DECISION MAKING, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS, LACK OF EQUALITY OF STAKEHOLDERS AGAINST THE LAW, AND TREATMENT-ORIENTATION INSTEAD OF HEALTH-ORIENTATION HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGES. DESPITE THE 2014 IRAN'S PROMOTION OF HEALTH SYSTEM, THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY BEFORE THE COMPONENTS OF GOOD HEALTH GOVERNANCE ARE REALIZED. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.
422	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFICIENCY OF TOOLS FOR FIGHTING SOFTWARE PIRACY IN THE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY. OUR PAPER EXAMINES SOFTWARE PIRACY IN 99 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1994-2010, USING CONTEMPORARY AND NON-CONTEMPORARY QUANTILE REGRESSIONS. THE INTUITION FOR MODELLING DISTRIBUTIONS CONTINGENT ON EXISTING LEVELS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY IS THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TOOLS AGAINST PIRACY MAY CONSISTENTLY DECREASE OR INCREASE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE INCREASING LEVELS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY. HENCE, BLANKET POLICIES AGAINST SOFTWARE PIRACY ARE UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED UNLESS THEY ARE CONTINGENT ON INITIAL LEVELS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY AND TAILORED DIFFERENTLY ACROSS COUNTRIES WITH LOW, MEDIUM AND HIGH LEVELS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GDP PER CAPITA, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE, MAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS, MULTILATERAL TREATIES, BILATERAL TREATIES, WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANISATION TREATIES, MONEY SUPPLY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON SOFTWARE PIRACY. EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED WEALTH REDUCES SOFTWARE PIRACY, AND THE TENDENCY NOT TO INDULGE IN SOFTWARE PIRACY BECAUSE OF EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED WEALTH INCREASES WITH THE INCREASING SOFTWARE PIRACY LEVELS. HENCE, THE NEGATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIVENESS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY TO CHANGES IN INCOME LEVELS IS AN INCREASING FUNCTION OF SOFTWARE PIRACY. MOREOVER, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLICY INSTRUMENTS AND SOFTWARE PIRACY DISPLAY VARIOUS PATTERNS: U-SHAPE, KUZNETS-SHAPE, S-SHAPE AND NEGATIVE THRESHOLDS. A NEGATIVE THRESHOLD REPRESENTS NEGATIVE ESTIMATES WITH THE INCREASING NEGATIVE MAGNITUDE THROUGHOUT THE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOFTWARE PIRACY. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR STUDY.
423	UNDER THE NEW CONCEPTION OF LAW, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, WHICH BEGINS WITH ACCESS TO THE PROCESS, SHOULD SPECIALLY BE CONSIDERED. SUBJECTIVE RIGHT, LEGITIMATE INTEREST, DIFFUSE INTEREST, WHEN RIGIDLY INTERPRETED, CONFIGURE A TRUE FENCE, PREVENTING ACCESS TO THE ANNULMENT LITIGATION PROCESS (AS WELL AS THE ACTION OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAW). HENCE, THIS NEW APPROACH SEEKS TO GIVE A DIFFERENT SCOPE TO THOSE TERMS, ADMITTING AN EVOLUTIVE INTERPRETATION FOR THE SAKE OF THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, THUS FACILITATING ACCESS TO THE PROCESS. LIKEWISE, THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION PRECLUDES THE EXISTENCE OF ACTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNULMENT JURISDICTIONAL CONTROL. ON THE OTHER HAND, REQUIRING PRIOR EXHAUSTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE TO INITIATE A PROPERTY REPARATION ACTION CONSTITUTES A REAL DEPRIVATION OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE. GIVEN THE SHORT PERIOD FOR FILING ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS (10 CALENDAR DAYS), IN THE CASE OF OMISSION, IF THE THESIS OF THE PRIOR EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY WERE ACCEPTED, THE REMEDIAL ACTIONS WOULD BE LOST, UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND, ESPECIALLY, THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION. FINALLY, THE MODERN DOCTRINE FAVORS ATTRIBUTING POSITIVE EFFECT TO THE SILENCE OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS POSITION, WHICH DOES NOT COLLIDE WITH CURRENT REGULATIONS, STRENGTHENS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES THAT INFORM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AS A PROJECTION OF THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROTECTION.
424	PHENOMENON OF DISCRIMINATION AND MOBBING UNDOUBTEDLY CONSTITUTE A DENIAL OF GUARANTEED HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF PERSONAL DIGNITY AT WORK, AND THE RULE OF LAW UPON WHICH EVERY DEMOCRATICALLY ORIENTED SOCIETY IS BASED. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION OF EMPLOYED PERSONS, AND ABOVE ALL THEIR MENTAL AND MORAL INTEGRITY, SERBIAN LEGAL SYSTEM WAS IN THE PAST DECADE, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, COMPLEMENTED BY TWO SEPARATE LAWS, NAMELY THE LAW ON PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION AND LAW OF PREVENTION OF MOBBING. THE ADOPTED LEGAL TERMS "DISCRIMINATION" AND "MOBBING" ARE CLEARLY DEFINED AND DELIMITED. HOWEVER, AS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IN BOTH LEGAL THEORY AND JURISPRUDENCE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TERMS IS STILL INSUFFICIENTLY CLEARLY DEFINED. ONE POSSIBLE REASON FOR THIS LIES IN NUMEROUS SIMILARITIES AND FREQUENT OVERLAPPING IN PRACTICE. THIS PAPER ANALYZES SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DISCRIMINATION AND MOBBING AND THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THIS FIELD IN THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA, CHARACTERIZED BY A CONFUSION IN THE APPLICATION OF LAW, AS WELL AS INCONSISTENT COURTROOM PRACTICE. EVEN THOUGH DISCRIMINATION AND MOBBING ARE TWO DIFFERENT PHENOMENA BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIFFERENT MOTIVES, AND ADDRESSED BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION, SOME EXPERTS STILL INCORRECTLY ASSUME THAT DISCRIMINATION IS A MODE OF EXECUTION OF MOBBING, AND THAT MOBBING IS A FORM OF DISCRIMINATION, WHICH, IN ADDITION TO HINDERING THE APPLICATION OF LAW, FURTHER AGGRAVATES THE POSITION OF THE VICTIM SEEKING PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS IN COURT OR THROUGH ANOTHER LEGALLY DEFINED PROCEDURE.
425	FROM OBSERVING THE TEACHING AND PRACTICE OF LAW, IT IS FOUND THAT A THEORY OF PRINCIPLES HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE NATIONAL CONTEXT. A SECTION OF THE DOCTRINE ASSUMES THEM AS A MAIN NORMATIVE PARADIGM, WITH POLITICAL (RATIONAL LEGITIMACY CRITERIA), AXIOLOGICAL (VALUE PRECISION) AND LEGAL (MATERIAL VALIDITY CRITERIA) FUNCTIONS; THE OTHER ONE INDICATES THAT THEY ARE AUXILIARY CRITERIA OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY. THIS CONFUSION HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE REQUIRED LEGAL REASONING FOR A CORRECT AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOCIAL STATE AND JUSTIFIES A DETAILED STUDY OF THE PRINCIPLES NOTION ASSUMED BY THE 1991 NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OF COLOMBIA. IN ADDITION, A WEAK DOMESTIC DOCTRINE HAS BEEN LIMITED, IN GENERAL, TO REPRODUCE THE IDEAS OF MAJOR LAW PHILOSOPHERS WRITTEN OUTSIDE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE COLOMBIAN POLITICAL MODEL. BOTH CONFUSION AND DECONTEXTUALIZATION JUSTIFY THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE: TO FACILITATE THE COMPREHENSION OF THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES IN THE COLOMBIAN SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, THEIR NATURE AND FUNCTIONS BY RESEARCHING OF THE WILL OF THE CONSTITUENT. THIS WILL AID TO OVERCOME THE CONTRADICTORY JURISPRUDENCE ON THE SUBJECT AND THE INCORRECT COMPREHENSION OF ARTICLE 230 OF THE CONSTITUTION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH METHOD OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OF 1991 OFFICIAL JOURNALS, THE MICROFILM ROLLS THAT REST IN THE GENERAL ARCHIVE OF THE NATION AND INTERVIEWS WITH SOME FORMER CONSTITUENTS WAS USED.
426	TRUTH COMMISSIONS HAVE BECOME KEY MECHANISMS IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE SCHEMES IN POST CONFLICT SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO ASSURE TRANSITIONS TO PEACE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES EXAMINE WHAT MUST HAPPEN TO ENSURE THAT THE TRANSITION PROCESS INITIATED BY A TRUTH COMMISSION SUCCESSFULLY CONTINUES AFTER THE COMMISSION CONCLUDES ITS TRUTH-GATHERING WORK AND SUBMITS ITS FINAL REPORT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE ATTENTION OFTEN FOCUSES ON PROSECUTIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, REPARATIONS ALSO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. THE AUTHORS SHARE THEIR OBSERVATIONS OF HOW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS), CIVIL SOCIETY SECTORS AND VICTIM-SURVIVOR'S ASSOCIATIONS STRUGGLE OVER REPARATIONS IN POST TRUTH COMMISSION PERU, OFFERING A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF KEY THEORETICAL SUPPOSITIONS ABOUT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE: THEY EXPLORE WHETHER THE ACT OF TELLING THE TRUTH TO AN OFFICIAL BODY IS SOMETHING THAT HELPS OR HINDERS A VICTIM-SURVIVOR IN HIS OR HER OWN RECOVERY PROCESS, AND WHETHER IN GIVING TESTIMONIES VICTIM-SURVIVORS PLACE PARTICULAR DEMANDS UPON THE STATE. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT WHILE TESTIMONY GIVING MAY POSSIBLY HAVE TEMPORARY CATHARTIC EFFECTS, IT MUST BE FOLLOWED BY CONCRETE ACTIONS. TRUTH TELLERS MAKE AN IMPLICIT CONTRACT WITH THEIR INTERLOCUTORS TO RESPOND THROUGH ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND REDRESS. OH, WHY SHOULD I REMEMBER ALL OF THAT AGAIN? FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD TO THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET TO THE TOP OF MY HEAD-I'VE TOLD WHAT HAPPENED HERE SO MANY TIMES. AND FOR WHAT? NOTHING EVER CHANGES.(1)
427	AS BRITISH COLONIALISM IN HONG KONG IS BROUGHT TO AN END ON JULY 1, 1997, A NEW SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (SAR) OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WILL BE BORN. THE 1984 SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION THAT FORETOLD THESE DEVELOPMENTS AIMED TO CREATE A NEW TERRITORIAL ENTITY WITH SELF-RULE AND A HIGH DEGREE OF AUTONOMY. THE AGREEMENT SPECIFIED THE MAINTENANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND A DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY, ALL TO BE ASSURED UNDER THE NEW BASIC LAW OF THE HONG KONG SAR. THE YEARS SINCE THE 1984 AGREEMENT HAVE BORNE WITNESS TO THE FOUNDING OF THIS NEW POLITICAL ENTITY. AS WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDINGS, THIS ONE MAY SERVE TO PREDICT THE CHARACTER OF THE EMERGING TERRITORIAL COMMUNITY THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE REVIEWS THIS FOUNDING AND OFFERS UP A TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK AS THE DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE NEW RATHER SHAKY REGIME. THIS FRAMEWORK AROSE OUT OF THE INTRICATE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIPS AMONG HONG KONG, BEIJING AND LONDON, IN SPITE OF BEIJING'S EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE HONG KONG FROM THE DISCURSIVE PROCESS WHICH WOULD DEFINE ITS FUTURE. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE RISKS EVIDENT IN THIS FOUNDING PROCESS, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS, AND IDENTIFIES THOSE ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE DRAWS COMPARATIVE ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDING AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN A UNIQUE EMERGENT TERITORIAL COMMUNITY OF THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
428	FOR THE PAST DECADE, CHINA AND JAPAN HAVE BEEN COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER OVER AID MARKET WITH ITS IMPLICIT INTENTION TO PURSUE THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, WHICH TURNED INTO A RIVALRY BETWEEN TWO DIPLOMATIC CONCEPTS: CHINESE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) VERSUS JAPANESE FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC (FOIP) STRATEGY. THE SEVERE COMPETITION OVER HIGH-SPEED RAIL (HSR) BY TWO COUNTRIES, JOINED BY FRENCH AND GERMAN COMPETITORS, HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED FOR THE BENEFIT OF CHINA, TAKING ALL OF ITS CATCHUP BENEFITS WITH ITS DUBIOUS SENSE OF RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ASKS IF THE TWO INITIATIVES CAN COEXIST WITH THE ENTRY OF INDIA INTO THE GAME AND FORM AN EQUILIBRIUM OF 'GRAND COALITION', BENEFITING ALL ITS PLAYERS AS 'WIN-WIN-WIN' GAME, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE FEASIBLE AND UNSTABLE. NEVERTHELESS, JAPAN STILL SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD REASON TO KEEP INDIA AS A STRATEGIC PARTNER OF FOIP AS WELL AS A 'GATEWAY' FOR CENTRAL AND WESTERN ASIA WITH FRAGILE STATES SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, AND OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ODA) COULD PLAY A SIGNIFICANT CATALYST ROLE AS 'HUMAN SECURITY' PROMOTED BY PROFESSOR AMARTYA SEN AND EX-UNHCR MS. SADAKO OGATA. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TOGETHER WITH THE EXIT OF THE ISOLATIONIST US ADMINISTRATION MAY PROVIDE THE WORLD WITH GLIMMERING SENSE OF HOPE FOR THE YEAR 2021 AND BEYOND, IF AND ONLY IF ONE BECOMES MORE AWARE OF THE COMPLEMENTARITIES OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF CHINA, INDIA AND JAPAN TO PURSUE COMMON INTERESTS. Y
429	WITH GLOBALIZATION, THE CASES OF CHINESE ENTERPRISES' CROSS-BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M&A) ARE INCREASING RAPIDLY. THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE HOST COUNTRY HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING M&A PERFORMANCE, WHICH HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF CROSS-BORDER M&A. BASED ON THIS, FOR OUR STUDY, WE SELECTED CASES OF CROSS-BORDER M&A OF LISTED COMPANIES IN CHINA FROM 2007 TO 2018 AS RESEARCH SAMPLES TO EMPIRICALLY TEST THE IMPACT OF THE HOST COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE CAPACITY ON THE CROSS-BORDER M&A PERFORMANCE OF ACQUIRERS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HOST COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE CAPACITY HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE M&A PERFORMANCE IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT IN THE LONG TERM, IT CAN EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THE CROSS-BORDER M&A PERFORMANCE OF ACQUIRERS. AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIFIC TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTAL GOVERNANCE CAPACITY OF SIX DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS AND LONG-TERM M&A PERFORMANCE, THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROMOTIONAL EFFECT ON LONG-TERM M&A PERFORMANCE. THIS IMPLIES THAT ACQUIRERS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF GOVERNMENTAL GOVERNANCE CAPACITY ON M&A, AND CONSCIOUSLY LEAN TOWARD COUNTRIES WITH STRONG GOVERNANCE CAPACITY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN LONG-TERM VALUE GROWTH WHEN ARRANGING OVERSEAS M&A ACTIVITIES. THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PAPER PROVIDES A RELIABLE BASIS ON WHICH FOR COMPANIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN COMPLEX ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES.
430	THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS THRIVING DUE TO THE GLOBAL USE OF THE INTERNET. THE DIGITAL ERA HAS REVOLUTIONIZED THE SCOPE, PRACTICES, AND EVEN THE DEFINITION OF FREEDOM EXPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT ALSO EVOKES A NUMBER OF SOCIAL CONCERNS. OFFENSES SUCH AS THE CIRCULATION OF DEFAMATION, HATE SPEECH, MISLEADING PROPAGANDA TO THE MASSES, AND FRAUD, FOR INSTANCE, CAN BE FOUND IN THE INTERNET. CERTAIN LIMITATIONS DERIVING FROM THE CONDITIONS PRESCRIBED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES AND INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION ARE THEREFORE PRUDENT TO PREVENT THE EXCESS OF FREEDOM. AS A STATE THAT ABIDES TO THE RULE OF LAW, INDONESIA RECOGNIZES THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AS A MANIFESTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT IS CRUCIAL TO DEMOCRACY. WHILE NEW LAWS SUCH AS THE INFORMATION AND ELECTRONIC TRANSACTION ACT HAVE BEEN ENACTED TO ANSWER THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT BY THE DIGITAL ERA UPON THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE EXISTING LAWS HAVE ACCOMMODATED AN IDEAL BALANCE BETWEEN RESTRICTION AND PROTECTION FOR THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION REMAINS A MATTER WORTH REVIEWING. THIS PAPER AIMS TO STUDY THE LIMITS OF THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, PARTICULARLY IN THE DIGITAL CONTEXT, IN THE CONSTELLATION OF THE INDONESIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND HOW THEY CONVERGE AND CORRELATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. FINALLY, THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT MUST PROTECT ITS CITIZENS FROM THE SPREAD AND USE OF ILLEGAL CONTENT IN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS BY ENFORCING AND HARMONIZING ITS CRIMINAL, PRIVATE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONFIGURATIONS.
431	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES TRACES OF THE STATE IN THREE URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS OF MEXICO CITY. INSTEAD OF ASKING WHAT IS THE STATE, WHERE IS IT LOCATED OR WHAT DOES IT DO, THE QUESTION POSED HERE IS: WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF STATE PRACTICES AT THE STREET LEVEL? BY ETHNOGRAPHICALLY AND VISUALLY DESCRIBING HOW PROTECTION IS PERFORMED, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE STATE IS NOT ONLY 'SOMEWHERE' IN SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS, ACTORS OR INSTITUTIONS; IT ALSO MANIFESTS MATERIALIZED EFFECTS PRODUCED BY A WEB OF CONFLICT-RIDDEN RELATIONS. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STATE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH GENERALLY REVOLVES AROUND ITS FAILURES AND INFORMALITY. THE PROPOSAL HERE IS THAT, BY ANALYZING THE STATE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF URBAN SPACE, THE FOCUS IS ON HOW PROTECTION IS PERFORMED AND BY MEANS OF WHICH OPERATIONS, RELATIONS, OBJECTS AND ACTORS-NOT WHETHER THE STATE WORKS OR NOT, OR WHETHER ACTORS ARE FORMAL OR INFORMAL. BASED ON ONGOING ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK AND A COLLABORATION WITH TWO VISUAL ARTISTS IN MEXICO CITY, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THREE PROTECTIVE PROCESSES: THE 'MUSCLES' (INVOLVING ACTORS INCLUDING POLICE OFFICERS, GANG LEADERS, FATHERS AND HUSBANDS), THE 'SAINT' (INVOLVING CARING FOR REPRESENTATIONS OF VARIOUS SAINTS AND PARTICIPATION IN OTHER CLIENTELISTIC CHAINS OF FIDELITY) AND THE 'AMPARO' (A FORM OF APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A PERSONALIZED MANNER FOR THE REDRESS OF INTERPERSONAL CONFLICTS). THESE ARE THREE SETS OF PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED IN MEXICO'S HISTORY OF STATE FORMATION SINCE THE DAYS OF COLONIZATION.
432	IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS ANALYSE CURRENT SPENDING PRIORITIES OF THE PEACEBUILDING FUND (PBF)-FUNDED SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) PROGRAMMES. THEY CONCLUDE THAT THESE SPENDING PRIORITIES DO NOT APPEAR TO SUPPORT TRADITIONAL COMPONENTS OF SSR AND UNDERFUND PROGRAMMES NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THIS IS OBSERVED DESPITE THE PUBLISHED COMMITMENTS OF UN PBF FUNDING PRIORITIES TO INCLUDE THE STRENGTHENING OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF SUPPORT TO THE WIDER SECURITY AND JUSTICE SECTORS. 1 THE UNDERFUNDING OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO UNDERMINE PBF'S GOALS FOR THE TYPE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC REFORM UPON WHICH PEACE-BUILDING, CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AND CONFLICT PREVENTION RESTS. FOCUSING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY, THE AUTHORS BUILD ON THE SCHOLARSHIP OF THE RULE OF LAW LITERATURE TO EXPLORE WIDER CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH LIMITED SUPPORT TO LOCAL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY. DRAWING ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE PEACE-BUILDING EXPERIENCE IN SIERRA LEONE, THE AUTHORS REFLECT ON CONCERNS WITH THE EFFECTS OF PAST AND CURRENT FUNDING PRIORITIES AND EXPOSE A NUMBER OF 'CAPACITY DEFICITS' WHICH HAVE EMERGED IN THE WAKE OF PBF FUNDING PATTERNS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN PBF-RECIPIENT COUNTRIES MORE GENERALLY, AND IN SIERRA LEONE MORE SPECIFICALLY. THIS WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING LITERATURE THAT SEEKS TO LINK SECURITY SECTOR REFORM WITH THE NEED FOR A MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO PEACE-BUILDING.
433	THE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION WHICH MIKHAIL GORBACHEV INITIATED IN THE USSR DURING THE PERIOD OF ''PERESTROIKA'' NOT ONLY POSSESSED A DIMENSION OF DEMOCRACY, MARKET ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW. THE SOVIET UNION WAS AN EMPIRE IN WHICH MANY PEOPLES - OFTEN AGAINST THEIR WILL - LIVED TOGETHER. THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE USSR, THEREFORE, CAME AS NO REAL SURPRISE. THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT SUCCESSOR STATE, RUSSIA, IS NOW FOR ITS PART A MULTINATIONAL STATE. CONSEQUENTLY, OBSERVERS HAVE OCCASIONALLY ASKED WHETHER RUSSIA TOO MIGHT NOT, SOONER OR LATER, EXPERIENCE THE FATE OF THE FORMER USSR. THIS WOULD HAVE FAR-REACHING INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS, THE EXTENT OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. SUCH A DEVELOPMENT, HOWEVER, IS BY NO MEANS INEVITABLE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY AND THE REGIONS IN RUSSIA ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY STRAINED IN MANY RESPECTS WOULD APPEAR TO BE CLEARLY OPEN TO COMMON SOLUTION BY ESTABLISHING FEDERAL STRUCTURES. IT WAS THE LACK OF ''ORGANIC LINKS'' OF THIS NATURE WHICH MADE THE DISSOLUTION OF THE USSR UNAVOIDABLE IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH THERE WAS NO TRADITIONAL STRIVING FORA SEPARATE NATION-STATE (AS,FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE BALTIC COUNTRIES). IN THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE, IRINA BUSYGINA-THRAENERT, SCIENTIFIC ASSISTANT AT THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTE OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN MOSCOW, EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS IN THIS CONTEXT. SHE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SOLUTION OF THE FEDERATION PROBLEM - COMPLICATED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY ACTION AGAINST CHECHENIA - IS ALSO ESSENTIAL IN THE INTEREST OF A SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRACY.
434	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER HAS BEEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCH IN TERMS OF ESTABLISHMENT AND ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE BORDER GOVERNANCE IN LITHUANIA IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING MIGRATION IN EUROPEAN UNION. THE OBJECTIVE ALSO HAS BEEN TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT OF STATE BORDER MANAGEMENT BEARING IN MIND THE MIGRATION PERSPECTIVES. THERE IS AN UNEXPRESSED DEMAND ON MIGRATION (ESPECIALLY IMMIGRATION) AS AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PHENOMENON TO HAVE SOME POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY OF TARGET COUNTRY. IT'S NEVERTHELESS TRUE, THAT FROM POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW THE MIGRATION TRENDS ARE USUALLY BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, SECURITY CHALLENGES IN TARGET COUNTRIES. EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES WHICH ARE THE EXTERNAL BORDERS OF EU FACE WITH EVEN MORE SPECIFIC OBSTACLES - THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF BORDERS AND NECESSITY TO BARE COSTS OF CONTROLLING MIGRATION FLOWS. THEREFORE THE EFFECTIVE USE OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MEASURES MANAGING STATE BORDERS IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE REACHING COMMON GOALS OF PUBLIC SECURITY, STABILITY, RESPECT FOR EUROPEAN VALUES AND RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER CONTAINS RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL ACTS AND THE SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF STATISTICAL DATA OF EUROPEAN UNION AGENCIES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE FINANCIAL DATA OF OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF LITHUANIAN STATE BORDER GUARD SERVICE IS ANALYSED, AIMING TO REVEAL THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF STATE BORDER CONTROL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE STATE AND EU INSTITUTIONS.
435	IF WE ACCEPT THAT SURVEILLANCE BY THE STATE AND 'SOUSVEILLANCE' BY THE MEDIA IN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES TEND TOWARDS A RELATIVE EQUILIBRIUM, OR 'EQUIVEILLANCE' SUPPORTED BY THE FUNCTION OF JOURNALISM AS A WATCHDOG AND THAT THE RULE OF LAW LARGELY PROTECTS FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE ACT OF ` MUTUAL WATCHING' IS UNDESIRED BY THE STATE AND COMES AT A VERY HIGH COST TO JOURNALISTS. THE COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY, LEGISLATIVE CHANGE AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC SENTIMENTS OF THE STATE, IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO COLLECT AND PROCESS BIG DATA ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE, DISRUPT THE PRECONDITIONS FOR A STRONG DEMOCRACY BASED ON FREE MEDIA AND FREE CITIZENS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE POLITICS OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF DOMINANCE OF THE STATE BY INVESTIGATING THE EXPERIENCES OF JOURNALISTS WITH SURVEILLANCE. OUR INTERVIEWS WITH 48 JOURNALISTS SHOW THAT JOURNALISTS ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF SURVEILLANCE AND ITS NOXIOUS IMPACT. WELL BEYOND SIMPLE 'WATCHING' THESE EXPERIENCES ARE REMARKABLY SIMILAR IN NON- WESTERN AND WESTERN COUNTRIES. JOURNALISTS ARE ENGAGING INCREASINGLY WITH TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER COMMUNITIES, AS THEY AIM TO DEFEND JOURNALISM AND THEIR LIVES. THEIR ACTIVISM IS OPERATIONALISED IN THREE AREAS: (A) IN RELUCTANT OFTEN-FRAUGHT COOPERATION WITH HACKTIVISTS, (B) IN SELF-DIRECTED PROTECTION OF COMMUNICATIONS AND SOURCES AND (C) IN NOT ALWAYS WILLINGLY ACTING AS DISSENTERS VIS-A-VIS THE STATE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE EXTENT TO WHICH JOURNALISTS CONSIDER EQUILIBRIUM TO BE DISTORTED, AND HOW THEY ARE COUNTERING ANY SLIDE INTO SUBDUED DEMOCRACY.
436	THE MOST RECENT TRANSFORMATION OF WORLD ORDER IS OFTEN DEPICTED AS A SHIFT FROM A WESTPHALIAN TO A POST-WESTPHALIAN ERA IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY INDEPENDENT SITES OF AUTHORITY. THIS INTERNATIONALIZATION OF AUTHORITY IS OFTEN CONSIDERED AS AN INDICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE GLOBAL LEGAL ORDER. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN ALSO EXERCISE AUTHORITY IN AN AUTHORITARIAN FASHION THAT VIOLATES THE SAME CONSTITUTIONALIST PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE USUALLY EXPECTED TO PROMOTE. IT IS THUS AN OPEN QUESTION WHICH POST-WESTPHALIA WE ARE IN FACT HEADING TO: A CONSTITUTIONALIZED ORDER, AN AUTHORITARIAN ORDER, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH? BASED ON A CONCEPTUALIZATION OF POST-WESTPHALIAN ORDERS AS A TWO-DIMENSIONAL CONTINUUM LINKING THE IDEAL-TYPICAL END POINTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM, WE ANALYZE THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY SYSTEM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS TWO POST-WESTPHALIAN ORDERS. WHILE WE FIND A REMARKABLE LEVEL OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INCIPIENT CONSTITUTIONALIST TENDENCIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS, WE ALSO FIND AUTHORITARIAN SUB-ORDERS IN BOTH INSTITUTIONS. MOST VISIBLY, THE LATTER CAN BE DISCERNED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL'S COUNTER-TERRORISM POLICY AFTER 9/11 AND EUROPEAN EMERGENCY GOVERNANCE DURING THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS. THE ARTICLE THUS ARGUES THAT THE EMERGING POST-WESTPHALIAN ORDER IS CHARACTERIZED BY A PLURALITY OF FUNDAMENTALLY CONTRADICTORY (SUB-)ORDERS COEXISTING IN PARALLEL.
437	SECTION II DISCUSSES SIX DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTIFYING INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW (IEL). SECTION III ARGUES THAT THE 'DUAL NATURE' OF MODERN IEL REQUIRES LIMITING 'WESTPHALIAN CONCEPTIONS' OF 'INTERNATIONAL LAW AMONG STATES' THROUGH PROTECTION OF 'COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS' AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES OF CITIZENS IN IEL. SECTION IV EXPLAINS WHY PAST DOCTRINAL DISPUTES AMONG LEGAL POSITIVISTS, NATURAL LAW ADVOCATES, AND SOCIAL CONCEPTIONS OF LAW HAVE LOST MUCH OF THEIR RELEVANCE FOR INTERPRETING IEL. SECTION V SUGGESTS THAT PROTECTING TRANSNATIONAL 'AGGREGATE PUBLIC GOODS' REQUIRES CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES TO IEL. SECTION VI EXPLAINS THE NEED FOR COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH SO AS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF HORIZONTALLY AND VERTICALLY INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC GOODS REGIMES. SECTION VII DISCUSSES WHY 'COSMOPOLITAN PUBLIC GOODS REGIMES' HAVE PROTECTED RIGHTS AND TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW MORE EFFECTIVELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS THAN THE PREVAILING 'WESTPHALIAN CONCEPTIONS'. SECTION VIII ARGUES THAT THE INADEQUATE PARLIAMENTARY AND CIVIL SOCIETY CONTROL OF MULTILEVEL ECONOMIC REGULATION MUST BE COMPENSATED BY MULTILEVEL JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS PROTECTING 'PARTICIPATORY' AND 'DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY', 'ACCESS TO JUSTICE', 'ACTIVE LIBERTY', AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN IEL. SECTION IX CONCLUDES THAT THE PERMANENT FACT OF 'REASONABLE DISAGREEMENT' REQUIRES RESPECT FOR 'CONSTITUTIONAL PLURALISM' IN IEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 'SUBSIDIARITY PRINCIPLE'. THE LEGITIMATE DIVERSITY AND COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF 'PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE' JUSTIFY JUDICIAL DEFERENCE VIA-A-VIS DIVERSE CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ECONOMIC COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS, CORRESPONDING 'DUTIES TO PROTECT' AND 'CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITIES' AS RELEVANT CONTEXT FOR INTERPRETING IEL.
438	ONE OF THE KEY PARADIGMS BEHIND THE OSCE'S EFFORTS TO PROMOTE SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE IS THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS INTO THE OSCE'S APPROACH IN THE FIELD OF COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM AND RADICALISATION THAT LEAD TO TERRORISM (VERLT). IT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE GROWING ATTENTION TO THESE PHENOMENA WITHIN THE OSCE AND THE WAYS IN WHICH ITS ACTIVITIES AND APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT OF THE ORGANISATION'S SELF-CLAIMED COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO PREVENTING AND COMBATING TERRORISM, USING THE FRAMEWORK OF CAUSES OF TERRORISM PROVIDED BY TORE BJORGO ET AL. THE AUTHORS SHOW THE OSCE'S VERLT APPROACH FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON ROOT CAUSES SUCH AS 'LACK OF DEMOCRACY, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE RULE OF LAW', 'EXTREMIST IDEOLOGIES', AND 'THE EXPERIENCE OF DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS ORIGIN'. ADDITIONALLY, THE OSCE, THROUGH ITS GENERAL WORK ON THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF SECURITY, ALSO ADDRESSES-SOMETIMES INDIRECTLY-MANY OTHER ROOT CAUSES, SUCH AS 'HISTORICAL ANTECEDENTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, CIVIL WARS, REVOLUTIONS, DICTATORSHIPS OR OCCUPATION'. BAKKER AND KESSELS CONCLUDE THAT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT REGARDING COUNTER-TERRORISM AND RADICALISATION, THE OSCE LIVES UP TO ITS CONCEPT OF COMMON AND COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY. THE ORGANISATION PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED PLATFORM FOR A WIDE RANGE OF ACTORS TO COOPERATE AND/ OR LEARN FROM EACH OTHER, ALTHOUGH CHALLENGES REMAIN IN THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VERLT STRATEGY.
439	IN THE ERA OF NATURAL LAW, THE FOUNDATION OF THE LAW WAS GROUNDED UPON SOMETHING BEYOND THE LAW ITSELF, I. E., EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS A HIGHER AUTHORITY, NATURE, OR EVEN THE REASON AND ONTOLOGICAL ESSENCE OF MAN. ACCORDING TO THIS REASONING, MAN HAS IN EFFECT BEEN CLANDESTINELY ELEVATED TO AN EQUAL PLAIN WITH GOD AND OPERATES IN THE EXTERNAL REALM, ESSENTIALLY OBSERVING THE WORLD, FROM OUTSIDE". THUS, ANY ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR LEGAL DECISIONS BY SUCH EXTERNAL FACTORS DEPENDS ON AN, OBSERVER, WHO ASSUMES A PRIVILEGED POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE LAW AND ITS GROUND. LAWYERS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THIS POSITION OF INTERPRETING THE POSITIVE LAW BY SEEKING THE GROUND OF THE LAW OUTSIDE OF ITSELF, I. E., THE EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE, SOURCE OF LAWS", THE, INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR", AND THE "FUNDAMENTAL NORM", FOR EXAMPLE. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CLAIMING TO BE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, THEY PARADOXICALLY TAKE THE POSITION OF AN EXTERNAL, OBSERVER" WHO PERCEIVES THE LAW "FROM OUTSIDE". THIS POSITION LEADS US TO APORIA, OR AN INSOLUBLE CONTRADICTION, REGARDING EXTERNAL GROUNDS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A MEANS BY WHICH TO EMERGE FROM THE ABOVE APORIA. USING THE THEORY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS AS ITS BASIS, THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS VIEWED AS A CLOSED SYSTEM AND, THE GROUND OF THE LAW" IS BY NO MEANS DERIVED FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS; RATHER, IT CAN BE STATED ONLY THROUGH AN INTERNAL OPERATION WITHIN THE CLOSED SYSTEM ITSELF.
440	DESPITE RECENT INTEREST IN THE HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE QUESTION OF HISTORICAL JUSTICE IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE DUE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERTEMPORAL LAW. HOWEVER, SUCH A FORMALISTIC APPLICATION RENDERS HISTORICAL INJUSTICE ON A STRUCTURAL LEVEL ALONGSIDE ITS SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL. THE INJUSTICE ISSUE ARISING FROM CONFLICTING NORMATIVE STRUCTURES IS THE FOCUS HERE. WHY IS IT THAT EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL LAW WAS CONSIDERED THE ONLY LEGITIMATE RULE OF LAW WHEN THE CASE IN QUESTION OCCURRED AND WHEN COMPLICATED PLURAL OR PARALLEL ORDERS COINCIDED AND CONFLICTED WITH EACH OTHER? THIS SPATIAL ISSUE SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE PREMISES THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED SUFFICIENTLY. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT FOR THE POSITIVISTIC TENET OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERTEMPORAL LAW TO STAND, THE INTERSPATIAL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE RELEVANT IN THE DISCOURSE ON ISSUES OF HISTORICAL JUSTICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF EAST ASIAN CIVILIZATIONS. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DISCOURSE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SOCIAL SPACE OF LAW OR INTERSPATIAL LAW. THIS STUDY DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO DECONSTRUCT THE VALIDITY OF CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW OR DEMAND REPARATION FOR HISTORICAL WRONGS. INSTEAD, IT SUGGESTS THAT INTERSPATIAL LAW MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM ON TWO COUNTS. FIRST, INTERSPATIAL LAW MAY SUPPLEMENT THE AGONISTIC, POSITIVISTIC APPLICATION OF INTERTEMPORAL LAW TO HISTORICAL CASES. SECOND, THE RECOGNITION OF THE SPATIALITY OF LAW MAY PROMOTE THE IDEA THAT DIFFERENCES CAN BE ACCEPTED WHILE AVOIDING THE MONOPOLIZATION OF THE SO-CALLED "UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL LAW."
441	THE HABSBURG EMPIRE'S FINAL YEARS AND ITS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN A STORY OF DYSFUNCTION AND NATIONAL DISINTEGRATION. THIS ARTICLE, BY CONTRAST, STRESSES THAT THE PREWAR HABSBURG STATE WAS FAR FROM DYSFUNCTIONAL AND IN MANY WAYS APPROXIMATED ITS OTHER NINETEENTH-CENTURY CONSTITUTIONALIST COUNTERPARTS WITHIN EUROPE AND ACROSS THE WORLD. YET THE WAR AND THE STRESSES SURROUNDING IT, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE SEAM OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS, TORE THAT CONSTITUTIONALIST STATE APART AS THE HABSBURG ARMY DECLARED ITS OWN INTERNAL WAR AGAINST THE HABSBURG CIVILIAN STATE. THE ARMY FOCUSED ITS IRE ON THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THAT STATE, WHICH IT VIEWED AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S WEAKNESSES, AND ULTIMATELY ITS INITIAL FAILURES, IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF THE WAR. THUS, THE HABSBURG EMPIRE DESCENDED INTO A STATE OF EXCEPTION AS THE ARMY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AN ARRAY OF LEGAL TOOLS DESIGNED TO ACCOMPANY INITIAL MOBILIZATIONS TO MAKE DEEP AND LASTING INCURSIONS INTO THE PRACTICE OF MANAGING CIVILIANS. THESE INCURSIONS CAUSED WIDESPREAD DISMAY AMONG BROAD SECTIONS OF THE HABSBURG POPULACE, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERMINING THE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES OF THE HABSBURG ADMINISTRATION. YET IN PLUNGING INTO A STATE OF LEGAL EXCEPTION, THE HABSBURG EMPIRE WAS HARDLY AN ANOMALY IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. RATHER, IT WAS A HARBINGER OF WHAT WAS TO COME AS THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY CONSTITUTIONALIST STATE CAME UNDER ASSAULT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IN EUROPE DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND BEYOND.
442	IN THE RECENT INTERNATIONAL HISTORY OF INSOLVENCY LAW REFORM, THE REFORM OF CORPORATE RESCUE AND RESTRUCTURING HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROJECT. IN CHINA, THE ENACTMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE BANKRUPTCY LAW 2006 SAW THE INTRODUCTION OF A BANKRUPTCY REORGANISATION PROCEDURE THAT INCORPORATES THE DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION MODEL FOUND IN CHAPTER 11 OF THE US BANKRUPTCY CODE. HOWEVER, THE CHINESE CORPORATE RESCUE PROCEDURE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERUSED DUE IN PART TO VARIOUS DRAWBACKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COURT-BASED AND HIGHLY POLITICALISED PROCESS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF REFORMING CHINA'S CURRENT CORPORATE RESCUE REGIME BY DRAWING UPON THE AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTARY ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURE. FOUND IN PART 5.3A OF THE CORPORATIONS ACT 2001 (CTH), THIS PROCEDURE WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A RELATIVELY SWIFT, INEXPENSIVE AND FLEXIBLE CORPORATE RESCUE MECHANISM FOR COMPANIES IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. IT COMPRISES A NONCOURT BASED MECHANISM UNDER THE CONTROL OF ONE OR MORE PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED PRIVATE ADMINISTRATORS. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE UK ALSO MOVED AWAY FROM EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE UPON COURT-BASED ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURES FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE ENTERPRISE ACT 2002. THIS MOVED THE UK CLOSER TO THE AUSTRALIAN PRACTITIONER-DOMINATED APPROACH TO CORPORATE RESCUE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE ADDITION OF A VOLUNTARY ADMINISTRATION-STYLE PROCEDURE TO CHINA'S CURRENT CORPORATE RESCUE REGIME MAY BE NEEDED AS CHINA DEVELOPS ITS MARKET ECONOMY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.

443	THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A BURST OF SCHOLARSHIP AT THE INTERSECTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. MANY SUPPORTERS OF THIS APPROACH ENDORSE A HEIGHTENED, "SUPER-STRONG" BRAND OF CHEVRON DEFERENCE TO PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONMAKING DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY. BELIEVING THAT THE EXECUTIVE'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN EXPERTISE, ACCESS TO INFORMATION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY WARRANT MINIMAL JUDICIAL SCRUTINY, THESE CHEVRON-BACKERS ADVANCE AN EXECUTIVE-CENTRIC VIEW OF NATIONAL SECURITY POWERS. OTHER SCHOLARS, BY CONTRAST, DISPUTE CHEVRON'S RELEVANCE TO NATIONAL SECURITY. THESE CHEVRON-DETRACTORS ARGUE FOR AN INTERVENTIONIST JUDICIARY IN NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS. BOTH CAMPS CRITICIZE THE SUPREME COURT'S SCALING OF DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE AFTER 9/11: CHEVRON-BACKERS ARGUE THAT THE COURT FAILED TO ACCORD SUFFICIENT DEFERENCE TO THE PRESIDENT, WHILE CHEVRON-DETRACTORS ARGUE THAT THE COURT FAILED TO CLARIFY THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES. HOWEVER, NEITHER SIDE APPRECIATES THE ROLE THAT JUSTICE JACKSON'S SEMINAL YOUNGSTOWN CONCURRENCE HAS PLAYED IN THE COURT'S RESOLUTION OF RECENT NATIONAL SECURITY CASES. YOUNGSTOWN MAKES CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION NOT EXECUTIVE POWER OR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THE CENTRAL JUDICIAL CONCERN IN CASES PITTING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AGAINST EXECUTIVE POWER. THE POST-9/11 SUPREME COURT, FOLLOWING JUSTICE JACKSON, HAS USED JUDICIAL REVIEW TO CATALYZE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION BY REMANDING TO CONGRESS POLICY QUESTIONS LACKING JOINT POLITICAL BRANCH SUPPORT. THIS DUAL-BRANCH THEORY OF GOVERNANCE PRESERVES A CRITICAL RULE-OF-LAW BASIS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF NATIONAL SECURITY DECISIONMAKING THAT CHEVRON'S BACKERS AND ITS DETRACTORS OVERLOOK.
444	THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE SUPERVISORY MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED TO GUARANTEE THE EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DECISIONS ON THE CONDITIONS FOR AMICABLE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. IT POINTS TO THE OBLIGATIONS THAT STEM FROM THESE JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS FOR THE CONTRACTING STATES, AND EMPHASISES THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ASPECT OF THIS SIGNIFICANT TOPIC WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. IT FOCUSES ON THE PERIOD WITHIN WHICH THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS HAS BEEN APPLIED IN CROATIA, AND UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERPRETATIVE ROLE OF COURTS, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND TO THE ECTHR. THE TOPIC IS ANALYSED MOSTLY FROM THE ASPECT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, BUILDING ON THE FOUNDATIONS THAT PROFESSOR OMEJEC LAID IN THIS FIELD IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA BY FIRMLY AND WIDELY EMBRACING THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL VISION, AND BY DRAWING AROUND HERSELF A POOL OF EXPERTS, PRACTITIONERS AND PERSONS FOR WHOM CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION ARE A VOCATION, AND NOT JUST A PROFESSION, IN THE COURSE OF FIFTEEN YEARS OF ANALYSING AND CREATING PIECES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW MOSAIC OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND CONVENTION LAW. WE HAVE CONSTANTLY WITHIN REACH ON OUR DESK THE FOUNDATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXECUTION OF ECTHR JUDGMENTS IN A BOOK BY PROFESSOR OMEJEC, A LEGAL EXPERT ENGAGED IN CONVENTION LAW, WHICH ANALYSES IN DETAIL THE STRASBOURG ACQUIS. THE CURRENT PAPER, BY REFERRING TO THIS ESSENTIAL PIECE OF LITERATURE, BUILDS ON THE POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE ECTHR.
445	THE PHENOMENON OF MONEY LAUNDERING AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF CRIMINAL GROUPS IS A NEGATIVE FACTOR IN THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE NEED FOR THIS STUDY IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE SCALE OF SUCH CRIMINAL ACTS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE, THREATENING THE RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY OF THE STATE IN GENERAL AND SOCIETY IN PARTICULAR; LACK OF LEGISLA-TIVE AND PRACTICAL BASIS FOR COMBATING THIS PHENOMENON. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO DEFINE THE CONCEPT AND THE ESSENCE OF MONEY LAUNDERING BY ORGANIZED CRIMI-NAL GROUPS AND ELABORATE SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND MEASURES TO COMBAT THIS PHENOMENON IN TERMS OF EUROPEAN AND UKRAINIAN DIMENSIONS. SEVERAL METHODS WERE USED IN THE STUDY, IN PARTICULAR: DIALECTICAL, SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL, HIS-TORICAL-LEGAL AND FORMAL-LOGICAL. LEADING RESEARCH METHOD WAS COMPARATIVE METHOD, WHICH HELPED TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPECIFICS OF CRIMINAL LAW PROTECTION OF PUBLIC RELA- TIONS ARISING FROM MONEY LAUNDERING IN UKRAINE, WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND THE UNITED STATES. THE AUTHORS DETERMINE THE NATIONAL POLICY OF UKRAINE AGAINST CRIMES COMMITTED BY ORGANIZED GROUPS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE OBSOLESCENCE OF THE REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK, GAPS IN THE ORGANIZATION OF COMBATING SUCH TYPES OF CRIMES, REDUCTION OF SPECIAL UNITS IN THE POLICE, AND INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF COOPERATION OF STATE BODIES. THE COLLECTED ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL MATERIAL WILL ALLOW THEORISTS IN THIS FIELD TO CONTINUE THEIR RESEARCH AND EFFECTIVELY COUNTERACT THIS NEGATIVE PHENOMENON.
446	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, CHINA'S TAX LAW REFORM HAS BECOME A HIGHLY VALUED AND DISTINGUISHED AREA FOR EARNESTLY ADVANCING CHINESE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION. WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE ON STRENGTHENING LEGALITY OF IMPOSING TAX, AS WELL AS NEW SETTINGS REGARDING CHINA'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TAX COLLECTION AND PROTECTION OF TAXPAYERS' WELL-BEING GRADUALLY AND VIGILANTLY ATTAIN RESPONSIVENESS FROM TOP NATIONAL LEGISLATORS AND SCHOLARS. MEANWHILE, THE EFFORTS EXERTED BY TAX ADMINISTERS ON FIGHTING TAX EVASION HAVE BEEN ELEVATED ON BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC GROUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FOCAL AREA IS THE EVALUATION AND COLLECTION OF PRESUMPTIVE TAX WHICH IS A COMMON ROUTINE FOR ADMINISTERS AROUND THE WORLD. MOREOVER, THE CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON ADMINISTERING TAX COLLECTION INVITE A RIGOROUS PROCESS OF REVISION AND MODIFICATION WITH CONTEMPORARY CONCEPTIONS OF TAXPAYERS' WELL-BEING. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF PRESUMPTIVE TAX COLLECTION, THE ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TAX COLLECTION SHOULD ADHERE TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTING TAXPAYERS AND ADVANCING THE GOALS OF DE-ADMINISTRATING ARDUOUS PROCEDURES TO CONFORM TO NEW TRENDS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IT ALSO PROPOSES THAT THE VIGOR AND DYNAMICS OF TAX COLLECTION EFFORTS SHOULD COINCIDE WITH NATIONAL GOALS OF REFORMULATING THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX COLLECTION MECHANISMS, SOLIDIFYING THE NATIONAL CONVERSION OF BUSINESS TAX TO VALUE-ADDED TAX, MATCHING WITH THE NEW WAVE OF BANKRUPTCY OF CERTAIN ENTERPRISES, AND SO FORTH.
447	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RADICAL REVISIONS MADE TO TWO CHARACTERS FROM THE AENEID, MEZENTIUS AND DRANCES, IN THE TWELFTH-CENTURY FRENCH ROMANCE LE ROMAN D'EN,AS. IN PARTICULAR, MEZENTIUS AND DRANCES ARE PORTRAYED LARGELY AS VICIOUS OR UNPLEASANT IN THE AENEID, MAKING THEIR DEPICTIONS IN THE EN,AS SURPRISING; FROM A TORTURE-PRONE EXILED TYRANT IN THE AENEID, MEZENTIUS BECOMES A REASONABLE ADVISOR ADVOCATING RESTRAINT AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE COWARDLY, JEALOUS DRANCES BECOMES LESS OBSEQUIOUS, MORE CLEVER, AND MORE DEVOTED TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE STATE. ALTHOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AENEID AND THE EN,AS IS A POPULAR AREA OF INQUIRY FOR CRITICS STUDYING THE ROMANCE, THE CHANGES MADE TO THESE TWO CHARACTERS ARE NOT OFTEN EXPLORED IN ANY DEPTH, PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEN AS LESS IMPORTANT TO THE CENTRAL NARRATIVE AND INDICATIVE OF CARELESS ADAPTATION FOR THE SAKE OF THE PLOT. I ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT THE TRANSFORMATIONS MEZENTIUS AND DRANCES UNDERGO ARE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED APPROPRIATIONS OF THEIR VIRGILIAN CHARACTERIZATIONS. THE AUTHOR DOES NOT SIMPLIFY THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE VIRGILIAN CHARACTERS BUT INSTEAD REAPPROPRIATES THEM TO COMMENT ON THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF THE COURTLY COUNSELOR AND HIS THEME OF BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVATE EMOTIONS AND PUBLIC DUTY FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE. BY SO DOING, HE CLEVERLY ENGAGES TWELFTH-CENTURY AUDIENCE'S EXPECTATIONS TO MAKE RELEVANT POLITICAL COMMENTARY AND GIVES TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY READERS NEW INSIGHTS INTO MEDIEVAL METHODS OF ADAPTATION.
448	THE TERRORISM ELEMENT ATTENDANT IN AN ARMED CONFLICT DOES NOT ALTER ITS DESTRUCTIVE NATURE VIS-A-VIS CIVILIAN PROPERTIES. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE MARAWI CRISIS WHERE THE PHILIPPINE SECURITY FORCES, IN RESPONSE TO THE THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, AND SOVEREIGNTY, RESORTED TO AERIAL BOMBINGS AND SHELLING OF PRIVATE BUILDINGS, RESIDENTIAL HOUSES, AND MASAJID INFILTRATED BY LOCAL TERRORISTS, RESULTING IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THESE CIVILIAN PROPERTIES. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF NON-COMPENSABILITY OF THESE CIVILIAN PROPERTY LOSSES. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF AND AGAINST NON-COMPENSABILITY ARE PRESENTED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE CONCEPT OF REPARATIONS IN BOTH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PHILIPPINE DOMESTIC LAW. BASED ON EXISTING LEGAL REALITIES IN PHILIPPINE DOMESTIC LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE, THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT REPARATIONS IN THE FORM OF COMPENSATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MARAWI CRISIS MAY NOT BE IMPOSED UPON THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT AS A LEGAL OBLIGATION. HOWEVER, PHILIPPINE DOMESTIC LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE LIKEWISE PROVIDES FOR SUFFICIENT GROUNDS THAT REPARATIONS IN THE FORM OF COMPENSATION HAS BECOME THE MORAL OBLIGATION OF THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT, WHICH IT MUST PURSUE IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE UNDER A REGIME OF RULE OF LAW. YET IRONICALLY, WHILE JUSTICE ESPECIALLY DURING THE TRANSITION IS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF REPARATIONS BOTH IN ITS MORAL AND LEGAL CONTEXTS, IT IS ONLY IN THE LATTER CONTEXT THAT REPARATIONS MAY BE PURSUED JUDICIALLY. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE NON-COMPENSABILITY ISSUE, THOUGH A LEGAL ONE, IS A QUESTION OF CHOICE ON THE PART OF THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT.
449	THE PRESENT ARTICLE REVISITS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW AS A TOOL FOR SANCTIONING THE MOST PATENT ABUSES AGAINST MIGRANTS. ALTHOUGH DEPORTATION IS TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE STATE INHERENT TO ITS TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY, THIS PREROGATIVE MAY DEGENERATE INTO AN INTERNATIONAL CRIME. THE PROHIBITION OF DEPORTATION HAS BEEN A WELL-ESTABLISHED FEATURE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW SINCE THE NUREMBERG TRIALS FOLLOWING THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THIS PROHIBITION HAS BEEN FURTHER REFINED OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS BY AN EXTENSIVE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. AGAINST SUCH A BACKGROUND, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, DEPORTATION MAY AMOUNT TO A WAR CRIME, A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY OR EVEN A CRIME OF GENOCIDE, DEPENDING ON THE FACTUAL ELEMENTS OF THE CASE AND THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT CRIME. THIS ARTICLE ACCORDINGLY REVIEWS THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS OF EACH CRIME AND TRANSPOSES THEM INTO THE CONTEXT OF MIGRATION CONTROL. IT HIGHLIGHTS IN TURN THAT, ALTHOUGH ITS POTENTIAL HAS BEEN NEGLECTED BY SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY FOR DOMESTICATING THE STATE'S PREROGATIVE OF DEPORTATION AND INFUSING THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE FIELD OF MIGRATION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR ASSERTING THAT A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND AUSTRALIA WITH REGARD TO THEIR DEPORTATION POLICY.
450	THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL PALM WITH LINKAGES TO BIOFUEL IN INDONESIA AND ANALYZES THE ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS. WE SELECTED THREE PLANTATION STUDY SITES IN WEST PAPUA (MANOKWARI), WEST KALIMANTAN (KUBU RAYA), AND PAPUA (BOVEN DIGOEL) TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS. RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL PALM IN ALL THREE SITES HAS CAUSED DEFORESTATION, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT SECONDARY EXTERNAL IMPACTS SUCH AS WATER POLLUTION, SOIL EROSION, AND AIR POLLUTION. IN TERMS OF SOCIAL IMPACTS, MANY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, I.E., EMPLOYEES, OUT-GROWERS, AND INVESTING HOUSEHOLDS, REPORT SIGNIFICANT GAINS. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THESE BENEFITS WERE NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, PARTICULARLY TRADITIONAL LANDOWNERS, EXPERIENCED RESTRICTIONS ON TRADITIONAL LAND USE RIGHTS AND LAND LOSSES. WE OBSERVED INCREASING LAND SCARCITY, RISING LAND PRICES, AND CONFLICTS OVER LAND IN ALL SITES. THREE MAJOR TRADE-OFFS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL PALM PLANTATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BIOFUELS: UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE GENERATED AT THE COST OF SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES; THERE ARE SOME WINNERS BUT ALSO MANY LOSERS; AND ECONOMIC GAINS ACCRUE AT THE EXPENSE OF WEAK RULE OF LAW. TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND TRADE-OFFS OF OIL PALM PLANTATIONS AND MAXIMIZE THEIR ECONOMIC POTENTIAL, GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKERS NEED TO RESTRICT THE USE OF FORESTED LAND FOR PLANTATION DEVELOPMENT, ENFORCE EXISTING REGULATIONS ON CONCESSION ALLOCATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, IMPROVE MONITORING OF LABOR PRACTICES, RECOGNIZE TRADITIONAL LAND USE RIGHTS, AND MAKE LAND TRANSFER AGREEMENTS INVOLVING CUSTOMARY LAND MORE TRANSPARENT AND LEGALLY BINDING.
451	TIGERS ARE A THREATENED SPECIES THAT MIGHT SOON DISAPPEAR IN THE WILD. NOT ONLY ARE TIGERS THREATENED BY DETERIORATING AND DECLINING HABITAT, BUT POACHERS CONTINUE TO KILL TIGERS FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICINE, DECORATION PIECES AND SO ON. ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN TIGER PRODUCTS HAS BEEN BANNED SINCE 1987 AND DOMESTIC TRADE WITHIN CHINA SINCE 1993, TIGERS CONTINUE TO BE POACHED AND CHINESE ENTREPRENEURS HAVE ESTABLISHED TIGER FARMS IN ANTICIPATION OF THEIR DEMISE. WHILE CHINA DESIRES TO PERMIT SALE OF TIGER PRODUCTS FROM CAPTIVE-BRED TIGERS, THIS IS OPPOSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT LIKELY ENCOURAGES ILLEGAL KILLING. INSTEAD, WILDLIFE CONSERVATIONISTS LOBBY FOR MORE SPENDING ON ANTI-POACHING AND TRADE-BAN ENFORCEMENT. IN THIS STUDY, A MATHEMATICAL BIOECONOMIC MODEL IS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE. SIMULATION RESULTS INDICATE THAT, UNLESS RANGE STATES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY INSTITUTIONS (RULE OF LAW AND LOW CORRUPTION) SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN THE RICHEST COUNTRIES, RELIANCE ON ENFORCEMENT ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE SURVIVAL OF WILD TIGERS. LIKEWISE, EVEN THOUGH CONSERVATION PAYMENTS COULD PROTECT WILD TIGERS, THE INABILITY TO ENFORCE CONTRACTS MILITATES AGAINST THIS. OUR MODEL INDICATES THAT WILD TIGERS CAN BE PROTECTED BY PERMITTING SALE OF PRODUCTS FROM TIGER FARMS, ALTHOUGH THIS LIKELY REQUIRES THE GRANTING OF AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELLERS. FINALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRADEOFF ENFORCEMENT EFFORT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS FROM CAPTIVE-BRED ANIMALS, BUT SUCH TRADEOFFS ARE WORSENED BY DETERIORATING TIGER HABITAT. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V.

452	IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY (CFSP), THE EUROPEAN UNION MAY ADOPT RESTRICTIVE MEASURES, ALSO KNOWN AS SANCTIONS, AGAINST NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSONS AND GROUPS OR NON-STATE ENTITIES. SUCH MEASURES ARE ONE INSTRUMENT - AMONG MANY OTHERS - TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN POLICY GOALS, INCLUDING THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION'S VALUES AND THE ADVANCEMENT OFFUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THERE ARE SANCTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS TO COERCE, CONSTRAIN, OR SIGNAL A TARGETED ACTOR, AND THEY ARE CHOSEN AND COMBINED WITH A VIEW TO IMPLEMENT THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY. BELAERONAVIGATSIA, A STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE ENGAGED IN REGULATING AIRSPACE AND PROVIDING AIR TRAFFIC ASSISTANCE IN BELARUS, WAS DEEMED RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPRESSION OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION FOLLOWING ITS INVOLVEMENT IN A FLIGHT DIVERSION THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE ARREST OF AN OPPOSITION JOURNALIST AND HIS COMPANION. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE COUNCIL FROZE ITS ASSETS, A DECISION THE ENTERPRISE CONTESTED BY ARGUING THAT IT COULD NOT BE HELD 'RESPONSIBLE' FOR THE REFERRED ACT, AND THAT THE SANCTION WAS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OFPROPORTIONALITY. THE JUDGMENT IN THE CASE BELAERONAVIGATSIA V. COUNCIL OFFERS AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES, REMINDS THE INTERPRETATIVE CRITERIA FOR UNDEFINED NOTIONS IN COUNCIL'S DECISIONS AND THEN CLARIFIES THE TERMS 'RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPRESSION' WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE ELEMENT OF CAUSATION, AND ASSESSES THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN AN AREA INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL MOTIVATIONS, SUCH AS THE CFSP.
453	THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" PROVIDES THE CRITERION OF OPERATION FOR THE DISCRETIONARY SCOPE OF MANY EXECUTIVE POWERS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES TO WHAT EXTENT THIS CRITERION ACTS AS A CONSTRAINT ON POWER AND ITS CONSISTENCY WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IT IDENTIFIES TWO KEY APPROACHES IN THE HIGH COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF SUCH POWERS: AN "IDEALIST" APPROACH, IN WHICH THE DECISION-MAKER'S SUBJECTIVE, POLITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPETING FACTORS RELEVANT TO DETERMINING THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW; AND A "REALIST" APPROACH, IN WHICH THE DECISION-MAKER'S ASSESSMENT IS JUDICIALLY REVIEWABLE TO ENSURE THAT RELEVANT PROCESSES WERE FOLLOWED AND FACTORS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. IN THE MIGRATION SPHERE, THE ARTICLE TRACES THE ADOPTION OF THESE APPROACHES THROUGH THREE EXAMPLES: THE EXERCISE OF A NATIONAL INTEREST DISCRETION TO REFUSE OR CANCEL VISAS; THE INTRODUCTION OF A NATIONAL INTEREST TEST FOR THE DESIGNATION OF REGIONAL PROCESSING COUNTRIES; AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE MINISTER'S PUBLIC INTEREST POWERS TO GRANT VISAS TO PEOPLE OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COURT SHOULD ADOPT A STRONGER REALIST APPROACH TO REVIEWING PUBLIC AND NATIONAL INTEREST DISCRETIONS THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF A NEW META-PRINCIPLE OF INTERPRETATION. THIS PRINCIPLE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC INTEREST DISCRETIONS IS INFORMED BY A MINIMUM CONTENT, TO BE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE STATUTORY CONTEXT, ORDINARY RULES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, THE WIDER NON-STATUTORY CONTEXT IN WHICH THE DISCRETION IS INVOKED AND UNDERLYING VALUES WITHIN AUSTRALIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.
454	THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE CURRENT RUSSIAN CIVIL LAW WITH A FOCUS ON A KEY PRINCIPLE OF BONA FIDES (GOOD FAITH). THE APPEARANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE IS APPRECIATED AS A GUARANTEE OF STABILITY AND SOCIAL ORIENTATION OF THE LAW. BY MAKING A BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW, THE AUTHOR SUPPORTS THE NORMATIVE CONSOLIDATION OF THE PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS DECLARED IN THE CONCEPTION OF CIVIL LEGISLATION. BESIDES, THE AUTHOR STRESSES THE PRINCIPLE IN QUESTION NOT ONLY FOR THE LEGAL REGULATION OF PROPERTY AND BINDING RELATIONS BUT ALSO THE PRACTICAL RATIONALE OF THE PRINCIPLE AS A PILLAR OF CIVIL LEGISLATION. FOOD FAITH IS DEFINED BY THE AUTHOR AS AN INTENTION OF A PARTY TO A CIVIL TRANSACTION TO PREVENT AT A MAXIMUM THE POSSIBILITY OF VIOLATION BY CONDUCT OF LEGAL RIGHTS AND JUDICIAL INTERESTS OF OTHER PARTIES, PERFORM THEIR RIGHTS STRICTLY UNDER THE CONTENT, SCOPE AND PURPOSE. BESIDES, THE AUTHOR TAKES UP THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GOOD FAITH TO SHOW THAT THE CONCEPT COVERS MOSTLY REASONABLENESS AND FAIRNESS OF THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES TO CIVIL RELATIONS. AT THAT, THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT NON-INCLUSION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF REASONABLENESS AND JUSTICE TO THE PRE-REQUISITES OF CIVIL LAW DEEMS A JUSTIFIED CLASSIFIED DEFAULT. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES WITH REMARKING A TENDENCY OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE TO BROADEN THE APPLICATION OF THE GOOD FAITH PRINCIPLE. THE LATTER SEEMS RELEVANT TO COURT ONLY IF IT CANNOT DELIVER A FAIR DECISION ONLY BY INTERPRETING AND APPLYING THE EXISTING THE APPLICABLE RULE OF LAW.
455	IN 2015, THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS) WILL EXPIRE AND A NEW GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AGENDA WILL BE ADOPTED WITH A DEADLINE OF 2030. ONE KEY INNOVATION WILL BE THE INCLUSION OF PEACE, SECURITY, RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE TARGETS IN THE NEW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). HOWEVER, THIS VERY INNOVATION HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE A SUBJECT FOR LENGTHY AND VIGOROUS DEBATES AMONG THE MEMBER STATES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR A UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS OVER SDG 16 REMAIN BLEAK. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO UNVEIL THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS DEBATE NOT YET COVERED IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE. THE FIRST SECTION IDENTIFIES THE SPECIFICITY OF ACHIEVING THE MDGS IN FRAGILE STATES AND THE KEY PHASES OF WORK ON INTEGRATING PEACE, SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE IN THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AGENDA WITHIN OPEN WORKING GROUP ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE SECOND SECTION SUMMARIZES THE ARGUMENTS OF BOTH PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS OF SDG 16 AND EXAMINES THE KEY ISSUES IN MONITORING AND FINANCING PEACEBUILDING AND STATEBUILDING EFFORTS AFTER 2015. THE CONCLUSION ASSESSES THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF ALARMISM EXPRESSED BY THE EMERGING POWERS, INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, REGARDING SDG 16 AND EMPHASIZES THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR PROGRESS IN ENSURING POSITIVE PEACE AND HUMAN SECURITY, ESPECIALLY IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES, WILL DEPEND NOT ONLY ON THE CLARITY OF TARGETS AND INDICATORS OR ON SUCCESSFULLY MOBILIZING FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THESE GOALS, BUT ON THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND ON DOMESTICS POLITICS WITHIN DONOR COUNTRIES.
456	CRIMINAL LAW DEALS WITH VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE LIFE IN THE SOCIETY. THE SUBJECTS OF THE CRIME, HEALTH, REPUTATION AEURO BROKEN VERTICAL BAR ARE SO IMPORTANT THAT ENDANGERING THEM REQUIRES PUNISHMENT AND IT IS TOLD THAT THE SOCIETY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC ORDER SHOULD PUNISH THE PERPETRATORS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE CRIMINALS SHOULD BE PUNISHED. THE PUNISHMENT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATOR SHOULD BE PROPORTIONAL. THE MORE SERIOUS THE CRIME, THE MORE SEVERE THE PUNISHMENT. BUT, IT SEEMS THAT IN THE PROCESS OF CRIMINAL TRIAL, THE ACCUSED HAS RIGHTS TOO. IT MEANS THAT SOCIETY HAS NOT AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY IN ACCUSATION AND PUNISHMENT AND IN ADDITION TO THE PROPORTIONALITY AND JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT THE TRIAL SHOULD BE FAIR. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SPEAK ABOUT JUSTICE ANY MORE IF THE CRIMINAL IS PUNISHED PROPORTIONALLY AND RIGHTLY BUT NOT FAIRLY, I.E. WITHOUT ALLOWING HIM/HER TO PRESENT HIS/HER CASE, DEFEND HIM/HERSELF AND OBTAIN LEGAL AID OR SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. IRANIAN CRIMINAL LAW, LIKE OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN RESPECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED, HAS PROVIDED THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL. THIS VALUE CAN BE EXPRESSED IN THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, RECOGNIZED IN INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS. IT SEEMS THAT THE STANDARDS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARE MOSTLY DETERMINED AND DEVELOPED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS CONCEPT. THE CURRENT PAPER CONSIDERS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN IRAN.
457	IN THE PAPER AUTHOR REFERS TO THE PASSAGE FROM THE PRINCE OF NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI, IN WHICH THE FAMOUS FLORENTINE SAYS THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF COMBAT: ONE WITH LAWS, THE OTHER WITH FORCE. AUTHOR DEFEND THE CLAIM THAT BY WRITING THIS, MACHIAVELLI OPENED UP A NEW AND STILL UNUSED WAY OF THINKING ABOUT NATURE-CULTURE RELATIONSHIP. A FOLLOWER OF THIS WAY OF THINKING WITHDRAWS FROM SAYING THAT NATURE IS SURPASSED BY CULTURE, OR THAT NATURE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT A SUBJECT OF AN ON-GOING HUMAN SPECULATION, AND REBUTS THE SOLE HYPOTHESIS THAT WHAT THERE IS, IS NOTHING BUT NATURE. MODERN WESTERN CULTURE ENTRUSTED ITS KEY OPPOSITION TO THE NATURE-CULTURE RELATIONSHIP. BY AND LARGE, POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY IS A STORY ABOUT SURPASSING THE NATURE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO MACHIAVELLI, THE JUXTAPOSITION OF NATURE AND CULTURE, THE NARRATIVE ON SURPASSING BY POLITICS THE LAWS OF NATURE, JUST AS WELL AS THE NARRATIVE ON US BEING STUCK IN IT, ARE ALL UTTERLY WRONG. ACCEPTING THE AMBIGUITY OF THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN NATURE AND CULTURE AND ASSUMING THAT THE SOCIAL CONTRACT IS INDEED FICTITIOUS, AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO QUESTION MACHIAVELLI ABOUT HIS VISION OF SUBJECTIVITY AND POLITICS IN A WORLD WHERE "NATURAL OBJECTS" APPEAR TO BE SOCIALIZED, AND "CULTURAL SUBJECTS" APPEAR TO BE DISSOCIAL. IN THE WAY AUTHOR PUTS THE QUESTION: DOES MACHIAVELLI RECOMMEND MONSTROSITY BY WRITING STORIES IN PRAISE OF MONSTROSITY AS IT MAY WELL SEEM?
458	RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR IN COMMUNIST CHINA AND VIETNAM HAS BEEN OFFERED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST A LARGE LITERATURE THAT CLAIMS A SOLID LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS REQUIRED FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR TO CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ONE COMPONENT OF THE COUNTERARGUMENT HOLDS THAT RELATIONSHIP-BASED LENDING HAS SERVED AS AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CHALLENGE THIS ASSERTION WITH EMPIRICAL FINDINGS THAT SHOW BANK CREDIT ALLOCATION THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON "CONNECTIONS" UNDERMINES THE IMPACT OF FINANCE ON INVESTMENT GROWTH. OUR DATA COME FROM VIETNAM, WHERE-LIKE CHINA-THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ARE EXPANDING DRAMATICALLY BUT RULE OF LAW HAS NOT KEPT PACE. ALTHOUGH VIETNAM'S BANKING SECTOR IS IN TRANSITION TOWARD A HEALTHIER SYSTEM, IT STILL ALLOCATES A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CREDIT TO "CONNECTED" ENTERPRISES IN LESS COMPETITIVE REGIONS. WE FIND THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE AN INEFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CHANNELING BANK CREDIT TO THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS. USING A TWO-STAGE EMPIRICAL APPROACH, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT BANKS PLACE GREATER VALUE ON CONNECTIONS THAN PERFORMANCE AND THAT THE FIRMS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO BANK LOANS ARE NO MORE PROFITABLE THAN FIRMS WITHOUT THEM. BY SOME MEASURES, CONNECTED FIRMS ARE EVEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABLE. WE CONCLUDE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE MOST PROFITABLE INVESTORS IN VIETNAM HAVE FORGONE THE FORMAL BANKING SYSTEM, PREFERRING TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES OUT OF REINVESTED EARNINGS OR INFORMAL LOANS (JEL G21, G28, G30, O12, K11).
459	GLOBALIZATION-AN HISTOIIC PHENOMENON HOUSING A CONCEPT WITH MULTIFARIOUS SIZES, SHAPES AND MEANINGS-IS EXERCISING A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON LEGAL PHENOMENA WORLDWIDE. AS A SOURCE FOR THE DEFORMALLZATION OF THE LAW, IT ISSUES FROM A HARD-TO-GRASP LOGIC IN OUR TIMES, AN ERA OF CHANGES, CHARACTERIZED BY A PROLIFERATION OF OFTEN AD HOC NORMAIIVE INITIATIVES AND REGULATORY SPHERES OF AUTHORTTY THROUGHOTT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THIS AMORPHOUS PHENOMENNN EXERCISES ITS EMPIRE OVER THE FORM AND VERY SUBSTANEE OF ENACTED STANDARDS BY UNDERMINING THE CLASSIC LEGISLAIIVE ROLE OF STANDARDS PRODUCIION ENSHRINED IN THE STATE, THE LATTER THEN YIELDING TO VARIOUS INTERNAIIONLL INSTITUIIONS DOMINATED BY SCIENCE, ECONOMICS OR BOTH AT ONCE. A CASE IN POINT IS OBSERVED IN THE WORKS OF THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE LEX MERCATORIA COMMISSION THAT SEEM TO HAVE RESPECIIVELY TRANSFORMED THE SCIENTIFIC AND MARKET STANDARDFOR INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS VALIDITY INTO THE BENCHMAKK STANDARD. THIS CHALLENGE TO STATE DOMINANEE BY MEANS OF GLOBAIIZED MULTIFARIOUS LOGIC IS REPLETE WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND IN TIME, FOR CITIZENS IN A GLOBAL COMMUNITY. THE DISLOCAIION BROUGHT ABOUT BY GGOBALLZATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND LEGAL PHENOMENA WILL RESULT IN A DUPLICATION OF LEGAL PROCESSES CHARACTERIZED BY STATE SELF-LIMITATION, NAMELY OWING TO ITS INCAPACTTY TO EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPAEE IN NORMATIVE PROCESSE.. THIS DUPLICATION IS FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF SPHERES OF NORMATIVE ACTIVITIES AND BY LATTER'S SPONTANEOUS AND HIERARCHIC INSTANTTATION.
460	THE STUDY EXAMINES THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE DECISIONS FOR BANKS' IN MENA REGION. AN UNBALANCED PANEL DATA COMPRISING OF 132 BANKS OPERATING IN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE MENA REGION FROM 2012 TO 2017, DATA WAS EXTRACTED FROM BANK SCOPE RESULTING IN 891 BANK YEAR OBSERVATIONS. MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS AND INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS DATA HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM WORLD BANK AND WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS DATABASE AND FINANCIAL FREEDOM DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED FROM HERITAGE FOUNDATION. WE USE THE TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEPENDENT AND EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. THE REGRESSION OUTCOME BETWEEN PROFITABILITY AND LEVERAGE SHOWS A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP. NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TANGIBILITY AND LEVERAGE IS FOUND. EARNINGS VOLATILITY IS NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO LEVERAGE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWTH AND LEVERAGE IS NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT. MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS GDP GROWTH AND INFLATION SHOW A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH LEVERAGE. FINALLY, THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, THAT IS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW HAVE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH LEVERAGE. THE STUDY RESULTS WILL LEND A HAND TO BANK MANAGERS TO MAKE VALUE-MAXIMIZING FINANCING DECISIONS TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE. IT WILL ALSO HELP THE POLICYMAKERS TO ARTICULATE AN EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN THE REGION. AS PER OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXPLORE THE DETERMINING FACTORS OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE FOR BANKS OPERATING IN THE MENA REGION. MOREOVER, THE FINDINGS FROM MENA REGION BANKS COULD ALSO SUPPORT THE COMPARATIVE STUDY WITH OTHER REGIONAL BLOCKS.
461	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE MITIGATING EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON THE FINANCE-ENVIRONMENT NEXUS IN A MULTIVARIATE EKC FRAMEWORK IN 123 SELECTED COUNTRIES DURING THE 1990-2017 PERIOD. WE MAINLY EMPLOY THE METHOD OF MOMENTS-QUANTILE REGRESSION (MM-QR) WITH THE FIXED-EFFECTS MODEL, AMONG OTHERS. FIRST, THE MM-QR ESTIMATOR REVEALS THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT REDUCES ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IN COUNTRIES WITH INITIALLY HIGHER LEVELS (THE 75(TH) AND 90(TH) QUANTILES) OF CO2 EMISSIONS THAN IN OTHER COUNTRIES (THE 25(TH) AND 10(TH) QUANTILES). SECOND, THE ATTENUATING EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON THE FINANCE-ENVIRONMENT NEXUS IS MORE REMARKABLE IN NATIONS WITH LOW INITIAL LEVELS (THE 25(TH) AND 10(TH) QUANTILES) OF CO2 EMISSIONS. THIRD, WE FIND THAT THE MARGINAL POSITIVE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON CO2 EMISSIONS IS SMALLER UNDER A GOOD REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAN UNDER CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY IN THE TOP EMITTERS (THE 75(TH) AND 90(TH) QUANTILES). FOURTH, UNLIKE OIL, WHICH HAS A CONSIDERABLE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF THE MAJOR EMITTERS, RENEWABLE ENERGY USAGE REDUCES CO2 EMISSIONS IN COUNTRIES IN ALL QUANTILES, PRIMARILY IN THE LOWEST QUANTILES. FIFTH, THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT URBANIZATION DRAMATICALLY WORSENS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN ALL ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE LOWEST QUANTILES. FINALLY, WE CONFIRM THAT THE EKC HYPOTHESIS HOLDS IN ALL COUNTRIES ACROSS DIFFERENT QUANTILES. THE STUDY'S FINAL SECTION DISCUSSES POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ALL COUNTRIES.
462	WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S ECONOMY AND THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARDS, PEOPLE PAY MORE AND MORE ATTENTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. IT FACES GREAT CHALLENGES IN ENERGY, RESOURCES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. IN RECENT YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE REALIZED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM. THEREFORE, THE PROTECTION OF ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. BASED ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THIS PAPER STUDIES THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN THE PROTECTION OF ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES. FIRSTLY, THIS PAPER EXPLAINS AND INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT AND PURPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW, THEN EXPOUNDS THE IMPORTANCE OF ECOLOGICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION, STUDIES THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY, DESIGNS THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION AND FRAMEWORK AND THE STRUCTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM, AND ADOPTS THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY METHOD. THIS PAPER STUDIES AND INVESTIGATES AN ECOLOGICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION AREA IN CHINA, AND TESTS WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY. FINALLY, THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RESOURCES IN THE ECOLOGICAL NATURE RESERVE ARE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED, BUT THERE ARE STILL PROBLEMS OF OVEREXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES AND POOR MANAGEMENT. EACH MODULE OF THE ECOLOGICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION SYSTEM BASED ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OPERATES NORMALLY, THE DELAY TIME AND OPERATION TIME ARE BETWEEN 1 AND 3 S, AND THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY IS NORMAL. IN ADDITION, THE FEASIBILITY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE OF EACH MODULE ARE MORE THAN 90%. ALL THESE SHOW THAT THE SYSTEM CAN MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF NORMAL OPERATION.
463	THE POLITICAL ASSERTION BY SUBALTERNS (SPECIFICALLY LOWER AND BACKWARD CASTES) THAT INDIA WITNESSED FROM THE 1990S ONWARDS, AND THE FORMATION OF GOVERNMENTS BY PARTIES REPRESENTING THESE GROUPS IN UTTAR PRADESH AND BIHAR, TWO ELECTORALLY CRITICAL NORTH INDIAN STATES, CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEEPENING OF INDIA'S DEMOCRACY. BUT THESE LOWER CASTE GOVERNMENTS MET WITH VEHEMENT RESISTANCE FROM PRIVILEGED STRATA, AND FROM A SECTION OF STATE ACTORS THEMSELVES, IN PARTICULAR, THE BUREAUCRACY. THESE GOVERNMENTS ADOPTED A RANGE OF STRATEGIES TO COUNTER THIS RESISTANCE IN TURN, WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF BRINGING THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY INTO SHARP CONFLICT. THE PROJECT OF LOWER AND BACKWARD CASTE EMPOWERMENT WAS DEFINED BY A POLITICS OF LEVELLING, WHICH PLACED GREAT VALUE ON INSTANTLY VISIBLE EGALITARIAN OUTCOMES, EVEN WHEN THESE COULD ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY DENTING THE RULE OF LAW AND WEAKENING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. BUT IT WAS PRECISELY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER INSTANT EGALITARIAN FIXES (ALBEIT ON AN AD-HOC AND SPORADIC BASIS) THAT THIS POLITICS COMMANDED SO MUCH LEGITIMACY AMONG SUBORDINATE GROUPS. DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN UTTAR PRADESH, AND SECONDARY LITERATURE ON BACKWARD CASTE POLITICS IN BIHAR, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THIS PRIORITIZING OF RIGHT OUTCOMES OVER PROPER PROCEDURES HAD ON PUBLIC CULTURE IN NORTH INDIA. IT ARGUES THAT THIS PRIORITIZING OF CONSEQUENCES OVER MEANS BRED A WIDESPREAD IMPATIENCE WITH A PROCEDURAL CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH WAS SEEN AS OBSTRUCTING THE MODALITIES THAT WENT TO SECURE JUSTICE IN REAL LIFE.
464	BACKGROUND: FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) FLOWS ARE UNEVENLY DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE WORLD AND DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS. THE LITERATURE POINTS OUT TO ECONOMIC AND NON-ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF FDI FLOWS, WHILE THE LATTER HAVE SHOWN TO GENERATE AMBIGUOUS EFFECTS ACROSS REGIONS. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NON-ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS AND THE FDI INFLOW IN CROATIA FROM 1996 TO 2017, THUS CAPTURING DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE ECONOMIC CYCLE. THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF FDI IS ANALYSED IN PARALLEL WITH THE ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS. METHODS/APPROACH: THIS STUDY USES AVAILABLE DATA ON FDI PER CAPITA AND A SET OF NON-ECONOMIC (INSTITUTIONAL) AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS. WE EMPLOYED THE OLS REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FDI INFLOW DETERMINANTS AND COMPARE THE RELEVANCE OF NON-ECONOMIC TO ECONOMIC FACTORS. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES INCLUDED IN THE MODEL (REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) COULD NOT BE POINTED OUT AS IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF THE FDI INFLOW IN CROATIA. ECONOMIC VARIABLES GDP PER CAPITA AND AVERAGE GROSS WAGE PROVE TO BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE FDI INFLOW IN CROATIA. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESEARCH RESULTS POINT TO A VARIETY OF FDI DETERMINANTS AMONG COUNTRIES AND ECONOMIC CYCLE PERIODS. GIVEN THE EVIDENCE FROM CROATIA, VARIATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS, MIGHT BE CAUSED BY THE DIVERSE FDI INFLOW CHARACTERISTICS AND SPECIFICITIES OF RECEIVING ECONOMIES.
465	PURPOSE THE CENTRALITY OF AGRICULTURAL SECTOR TO THE ECONOMY, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HAS DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF RESEARCHERS TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE DIFFERENT FACTORS DETERMINING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SECTOR. GIVEN THAT MASSIVE INVESTMENT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY IN THE SECTOR, ONE OF THE FACTORS IDENTIFIED IS THE ISSUE OF FINANCING. HOWEVER, FINANCING AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN A POOR INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE DEPRESSING. IN THE LIGHT OF THIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE NEXUS BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA WITH A VIEW TO INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY EMPLOYED ANNUAL DATA SPANNING THE PERIOD FROM 1981 TO 2016. THREE INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND FIVE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES WERE USED. BESIDES, FOR ROBUST ANALYSIS, THE STUDY ALSO COMPUTED AN AGGREGATE MEASURE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INSTITUTIONS USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT METHOD. AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG METHOD OF ESTIMATION WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA. HOWEVER, THIS POSITIVE IMPACT IS BEING UNDERMINED BY INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE ONLY STUDY THAT EXAMINES THE MEDIATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, ETC., IN THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT-AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE NEXUS IN NIGERIA.
466	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW ERA OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL THINKING IN EUROPE IN THE AFTERMATH OF WORLD WAR I BY DISCUSSING THE CONSTITUTIONS OF TEN EUROPEAN STATES. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE OFFERS ANALYSES OF THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESSES IN THESE NEWLY ESTABLISHED EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THEIR LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC ATTRIBUTES. CONSTITUTION-MAKING IN THE WAKE OF WORLD WAR I CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS A SILENT REVOLUTION AS IT BROUGHT ABOUT INSTITUTIONS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, HIGHER STANDARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, STRONGER ELECTORAL RIGHTS, CLEARER DIVISION OF POWERS, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, REINFORCEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED. THESE CONSTITUTIONS HAVE CLEARLY SUPERSEDED OUTDATED SYSTEMS OF ABSOLUTE MONARCHY AND INSTEAD EMBARKED ON THE ROAD OF EUROPEAN UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. THE PRESENT STUDY IS IMPORTANT FOR TWO MAIN REASONS: THERE HAS BEEN NO MAJOR HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL RESEARCH SO FAR THAT WOULD REFLECT THE COMMON TRENDS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE CONSTITUTIONS; IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ROOTS OF MODERN-DAY SOCIALLY DRIVEN CONSTITUTIONAL THINKING IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GROWING UNPOPULARITY OF DICTATORIAL AND MONARCHICAL REGIMES IN EUROPE INDUCED THE NEWLY EMERGED STATES TO TAKE A PROGRESSIVE COURSE. IT IS FURTHER CONCLUDED THAT IN REJECTING THEIR PAST, THESE STATES FOLLOWED LEGAL AND SOCIO-POLITICAL TRENDS OF DEMOCRACY DEVELOPING IN THE WESTERN EUROPE, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN VICTOR COUNTRIES OF WORLD WAR I.
467	ENVIRONMENT HAS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND HUMAN SURVIVAL. CLIMATE CHANGE IS INCREASINGLY CONDUCIVE TO NATURAL DISASTERS, EPIDEMICS, SOCIAL CONFLICTS, FOOD SECURITY, FINANCIAL SHOCKS, ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS, AND LIFE SUBSISTENCE. IN PURSUIT OF THIS ISSUE, THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS IN OUTCOME VARIABLE CO2 PROVOKED BY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES GOVERNANCE, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, RENEWABLE ENERGY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND ECONOMIC POLICY UNCERTAINTY IN APEC ECONOMIES. THE APEC REGION ACCOUNTS FOR 60% OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS, 62% OF WORLD GDP, 48% OF GLOBAL TRADE AND CONTRIBUTE 8.7% RENEWABLE ENERGY ANNUALLY. A DYNAMIC PANEL PMG-ARDL MODEL IS APPLIED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION OF MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION WITH DH CAUSALITY AND CS-ARDL FOR THE PERIOD OF 1996-2020. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS CONFIRM THAT GOVERNANCE, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, AND TRANSITIONAL ENERGY HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT TO MITIGATE CO2 EMISSIONS. THE REGION NEEDS TO DESIGN POLICY MECHANISMS SUPPORTIVE TO PROMOTE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ENHANCES TRANSPARENCY, ENSURE POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. IT DEVELOPS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENSURES THE ADAPTATION OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS, PROMOTES GREEN GROWTH, IMPROVES ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND IMPLEMENTS CARBON PRICING MECHANISM. ECONOMIC POLICY UNCERTAINTY HAS INSIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT GOVERNANCE, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND TRANSITIONAL ENERGY HAVE AN ESSENTIAL ROLE TO MITIGATE CO2 EMISSIONS AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY WILL BE HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF SDGS AND ACHIEVING SPECIFIC TARGETS SUCH AS (SDG-7: CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES) AND (SDG-8: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL) BASED ON THE LARGEST SET OF EMITTERS APEC.
468	THE 21ST CENTURY HAS WITNESSED A BACKLASH AGAINST MANY INTERNATIONAL COURTS (ICS). STUDIES OF IC BACKLASH HAVE GENERALLY TAKEN AN OPTIMISTIC TACK, NOTING THAT MOST COURTS HAVE SURVIVED BACKLASH INTACT OR-IN THE CASE OF THE PARALYZED APPELLATE BODY (AB) OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO)-ARE LIKELY TO DO SO AFTER A TEMPORARY PERIOD OF SLUMBER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE UNITED STATES' SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO PARALYZE THE AB, DERIVING LESSONS FROM THIS DEVIANT CASE OF BACKLASH AGAINST ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST ACTIVE AND INDEPENDENT ICS. UNDERTAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE "REVERSING DELEGATION" RESEARCH PROJECT, THIS ACCOUNT IS ORGANIZED IN FIVE PARTS. FIRST, I DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CREATION OF THE AB WAS A CLASSIC INSTANCE OF DELEGATION OF DISPUTE-SETTLEMENT POWER, AND THAT THE AB QUICKLY EMERGED AS AN ACTIVE AGENT OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION. SECOND, I EXPLORE THE ROOTS OF POLITICIZATION, NOTING THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH AB JURISPRUDENCE PRECEDED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ALTHOUGH TRUMP'S DELEGITIMATION OF THE AB WAS MORE FAR-REACHING THAN THAT OF HIS PREDECESSORS. THIRD, I EXAMINE THE ADMINISTRATION'S USE OF THE VETO POWER TO PARALYZE THE AB, AN ACT OF DE FACTO DE-DELEGATION. FOURTH, I ASSESS THE PUSHBACK FROM THE MANY OTHER WTO MEMBERS THAT SOUGHT TO DEFEND THE AB, SHOWING HOW THEY FAILED TO BLUNT THE US CAMPAIGN. FIFTH, I ANALYZE THE REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE US ATTACK, AND DRAW LESSONS FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.
469	IN JUNE 2000, THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO SIGNED A TREATY FOR THE DELIMITATION OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF IN THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO BEYOND 200 NAUTICAL MILES. WHEN THE TREATY WAS SIGNED, BOTH COUNTRIES REALIZED THAT THE INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TREATY DEPENDED ON THE SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL CERTAINTY OF DETERMINATIONS REGARDING HOW FAR THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBMARINE CONTINENTAL SHELVES EXTENDED. ON 13 DECEMBER 2007, MEXICO SUBMITTED INFORMATION TO THE COMMISSION ON THE LIMITS OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF REGARDING THE LIMITS OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF BEYOND 200 NAUTICAL MILES FROM THE BASELINES FROM WHICH THE BREADTH OF THE TERRITORIAL SEA IS MEASURED IN RELATION TO THE WESTERN POLYGON IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. MEXICO SOUGHT AN EXTENSION OF ITS CONTINENTAL SHELF IN THE WESTERN POLYGON BASED ON INTERNATIONAL LAW, UNCLOS, AND BILATERAL TREATIES WITH THE UNITED STATES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH MEXICO'S DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. PEACEFUL DELIMITATION OF MARITIME BORDERS IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING WORLD ORDER. MEXICO IS A COUNTRY OF PEACE, AND HAS ATTEMPTED TO USE INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A TOOL TO REPRESENT ITS INTERESTS. MEXICO HAS METICULOUSLY ADHERED TO A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL PRECEDENTS AND TREATIES TO SUPPORT ITS CLAIM. MOREOVER, MEXICO HAS GATHERED SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO VERIFY ITS SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OVER ITS MARITIME AREAS. IN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD RECOGNIZE THESE CLAIMS AND SHOW THE WORLD THAT THE U.S. STANDS FOR FAIRNESS, EQUITY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
470	PURPOSE - INTEGRATING SMALLHOLDERS INTO HIGH-VALUE GLOBAL MARKETS REPRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO EFFECT LARGE-SCALE POVERTY REDUCTION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO ADD EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO THE DISCUSSION OF HOW TO BEST INCORPORATE SMALLHOLDERS INTO THE FORMAL ECONOMY SUSTAINABLY AND RESPONSIBLY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER FIRST BUILDS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AROUND GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN THEORY AND LITERATURE ON SMALLHOLDER INCLUSION AND KENYA'S GROWING HORTICULTURAL SECTOR. IT THEN MOVES TO EXPLORE A KENYAN SMALLHOLDER-BASED BUSINESS MODEL THAT INCORPORATES 4,000 FLOWER PRODUCERS THROUGH AN EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT INTERMEDIARY. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNANCE, UPGRADING AND STRONG INTERMEDIARIES FOR INCLUDING SMALLHOLDERS IN HORTICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS. FINDINGS - IN CONCLUSION, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT ALTHOUGH SMALLHOLDER INCLUSION IS BOTH FAVORABLE AND FEASIBLE BASED ON THEORY, LITERATURE AND CASE STUDY ANALYSIS, IT REMAINS LIMITED. IT PROPOSES EMBRACING INNOVATIVE SMALLHOLDER-BASED BUSINESS MODELS AS A VIABLE PATH OUT OF POVERTY IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW LABOR COSTS, SUITABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND BASIC INFRASTRUCTURAL CAPACITIES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - LIMITATIONS INCLUDE A RELIANCE ON LARGELY QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS DUE TO GAPS IN AVAILABLE DATA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - POLICY IMPLICATIONS INCLUDE THE NECESSITY OF PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN EXTENSION SERVICES, THE CREATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER IS UNIQUE IN ITS FOCUS ON BUSINESS MODELS AND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS AS MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH TO INCLUDE SMALLHOLDERS INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
471	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE INFLUENCES OF RELEVANT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON E-GOVERNMENT (E-GOV) MATURITY IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (TEDC). COUNTRIES FROM EASTERN EUROPE, SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, LATIN AMERICAN AND SOUTH ASIA WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED E-GOV GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DIFFUSION ACROSS BOTH THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING WORLDS. WHILE SUCH A FOCUS IS USEFUL FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSES AT A GLOBAL LEVEL, IT IS HOWEVER ARGUED THAT MORE USEFUL INFORMATION WILL EMERGE TO ENRICH INSIGHT WHEN RESEARCH EFFORTS PARTICULARLY FOCUS ATTENTION ON ISSUES IN EMERGING PARTS OF THE WORLD. VERY FEW RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED THE FACTORS INFLUENCING E-GOV MATURITY IN TEDC AND WITH THE APPROACH EMPLOYED IN THIS PRESENT RESEARCH. USING RELEVANT THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS, THIS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED AND EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF 9 ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS OF SOCIO, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS ON E-GOV MATURITY IN TEDC. A 5-YEAR PANEL DATA CONSISTING OF 320 OBSERVATIONS OR DATA POINTS WAS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (OLS) TECHNIQUE. THIS RESEARCH ALSO PROVIDED ANALYSES FOR EACH OF THE SELECTED SUB-REGIONS TO ENHANCE INSIGHT. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALITY HUMAN RESOURCE, TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, INNOVATIVE CAPACITY, WEALTH, RULE OF LAW, AND TRANSPARENCY LEVELS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT E-GOV MATURITY IN TEDC. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY'S FINDINGS FOR RESEARCH AND POLICY MAKING ARE DISCUSSED. FUTURE RESEARCH AVENUES ARE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED.
472	THIS PAPER FIRST REVIEWS AND CRITIQUES THE DOMINANT REALIST AND CONSTRUCTIVIST ACCOUNTS OF ASEAN, WHICH HAVE ENJOYED MUCH PROMINENCE IN THE PACIFIC REVIEW SINCE THE JOURNAL'S FOUNDING IN 1988. ASEAN BEHAVIOUR AND OUTCOMES CANNOT BE FITTED INTO NEAT THEORETICAL CATEGORIES THAT EMPHASIZE EITHER MATERIAL OR IDEATIONAL VARIABLES IN EXPLANATION. INSTEAD, ASEAN DISPLAYS COMPLEXITIES IN BEHAVIOUR THAT ARE THE PRODUCT OF THE CONTINGENT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE MATERIAL (POWER, TERRITORY, WEALTH) AND THE IDEATIONAL (NORMS, IDEAS, IDENTITY) AS MEMBER STATES ACTIVELY SEEK TO MANAGE DOMESTIC ORDER AS WELL AS REGIONAL ORDER WITHIN AND BEYOND ASEAN. IN ALL OF THIS, STATE INTERESTS AND IDENTITIES REMAIN PARAMOUNT, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LONG-STANDING ASEAN NORMS OF SOVEREIGNTY/NON-INTERFERENCE REMAIN CENTRAL TO REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, AND DESPITE THE CHARTER'S NEWLY ARTICULATED POLITICAL NORMS OF DEMOCRATIZATION, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROSPECTS SEEM DOUBTFUL FOR BUILDING A PEOPLE-CENTRED ASEAN COMMUNITY IN WHICH REGIONAL GOVERNANCE DISPLAYS INCLUSIVENESS, SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE INTERESTS AND NEEDS OF THE REGION'S ORDINARY PEOPLE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT ITS ELITES DEEM APPROPRIATE. THE FINAL PORTION OF THE PAPER EXPLORES WHAT A CRITICAL APPROACH TO STUDYING ASEAN MIGHT REVEAL. IN PARTICULAR, THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THERE MAY BE ANY POLITICAL SPACES OPENING UP WITHIN EXISTING STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES FROM WHICH PROGRESSIVE CHANGE COULD EMERGE, EVEN IF SLOWLY, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE, KEY ELEMENTS IN BUILDING AN INCLUSIVE, ASEAN COMMUNITY.
473	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO FIND OUT THE STATUS AND TENDENCIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTE OF MODEL CASE IN UKRAINE AND TO CHECK ITS COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENFORCEMENT OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN MODEL CASES. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE MECHANISM OF THE INSTITUTE OF MODEL CASES IN UKRAINE IS GRADUALLY GAINING A SET OF CHARACTERISTICS OF A JUDICIAL PRECEDENT AND IS BECOMING A MODEL FOR LOWER COURTS, ATTORNEYS AND CITIZENS. IN THE EXISTING STATE-LEGAL MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THE ENFORCEMENT OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN MODEL CASES, JUDICIAL CONTROL IS CONSIDERED TO BE EFFECTIVE, WHICH IN THE CONDITIONS OF POLITICAL COMPETITION OF STATE EXECUTIVE BODIES IS ABLE TO ACT AS AN EXTERNAL AUTHORITATIVE AND RECOGNIZED INSTRUMENT OF STATE INFLUENCE ON THE ACTIVITY OF THESE BODIES, TURNING THEIR WAY TO RECOGNITION AND RESPECT OF A HUMAN AND A CITIZEN, ENSURING HUMAN-CENTRICITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE. IT IS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE FOR THE COURTS TO USE THIS METHOD AS A DAILY TOOL, TO INCREASE ITS FREQUENCY OF APPLICATION, IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASES OF THE OBLIGATION OF THE AUTHORITIES TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE JUDICIAL DECISION, ESPECIALLY IN MODEL CASES. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE EXISTING PROCESS OF ENFORCEMENT OF DECISIONS IN MODEL CASES IN UKRAINE ONLY PARTIALLY MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN JUDGES.
474	THIS TEXT PRESENTS AND ANALYZES PART OF THE MAPPING STARTED IN MATO GROSSO THAT MODIFIED THE STATE LEGISLATION RELATED TO THE DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. CHANGES THAT DO NOT FIND FERTILE GROUND IN A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, BUT EMERGE IN A CONTEXT OF DEEPENING NEOLIBERAL AND NEOCONSERVATIVE MEASURES THAT HAVE GAINED SPACE, MAINLY, FROM 2016 AFTER THE IMPEACHMENT, OR COUP D'ETAT, THAT REMOVED THE PRESIDENT. AFTER THIS, IN THE NAME OF EMPLOYMENT, GROWTH AND ECONOMIC STABILITY, THEY REPRODUCE AND EXPAND DISCOURSES THAT INVOKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION (AMENDMENT 95/2016), LABOR AND SOCIAL SECURITY REFORMS. PEDRO TAQUES (2015-2018), GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO, OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY PARTY (PSDB) HAS BEEN DECONSTRUCTING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT, GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THROUGH A SET OF LEGISLATIVE MEASURES THAT DISREGARD THEM. THE METHOD ADOPTED FOR ANALYSIS CROSSES INFORMATION FROM THE PERIOD 2016 TO 2018, COLLECTED ON OFFICIAL WEBSITES OF THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO, AND DOCUMENTARY DATA CONFRONTED WITH DISCOURSES AND MOTIVATIONS OF THE MAIN ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE ALTERATION OF STATE POLITICS, ANALYZED ON THE BASES OF REFERENCE THEORETICAL-CRITICS THAT APPROACH THE THEME STATE, SOCIETY AND EDUCATION IN THE CONTEXT OF NEOLIBERAL (RE) UPDATING. IN THE END, WE DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CORROSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT IN STATE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE MOST VIRULENT RETURN OF OLD AND AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL FORMS IN THE COUNTRY.
475	THE NOTION OF PUBLIC OPINION AS A PROCESS CANNOT BE LIMITED SOLELY TO THE EMPIRICAL BASIS OF A THEORY, IT MUST ALSO FOCUS ON THE POSITION THAT THIS NOTION OCCUPIES WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERPRETATION OF SOCIETY. JURGEN HABERMAS'S APPROACH TO PUBLIC OPINION STEMS FROM HIS CLASSIC WORK ON BOURGEOIS ADVERTISING. HABERMAS CONSTRUCTS THE NORMATIVE THEORY OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS BASED ON THE COMMUNICATIVE CONDITIONS IN WHICH A DISCURSIVE FORMATION OF THE OPINION AND WILL OF A PUBLIC FORMED BY THE CITIZENS OF A STATE CAN TAKE PLACE AS AN UNFOLDING OF THE ANALYZES ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPINION. IN THIS ARGUMENTATIVE WAY, HABERMAS TAKES UP THE HISTORICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL PROJECT OF MODERNITY, ATTRIBUTING TO THE PUBLIC OPINION THE FUNCTION OF LEGITIMIZING THE POLITICAL DOMAIN THROUGH A CRITICAL PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF A RATIONALLY MOTIVATED CONSENSUS. THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO MAKE EXPLICIT THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE HABERMASIAN REFLECTIONS ON THE RATIONAL FORMATION OF OPINION AND WILL, SINCE IT IS FROM THIS PRIMORDIAL CONCEPT THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE WILL TRACE WHAT LED THE HABERMASIAN REFLECTION TO SEEK THE CONDITIONS OF AN AUTHENTIC PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS IN A PUBLIC SPACE, WHERE THERE IS RESPONSIBILITY AND SOLIDARITY IN THE EXECUTION OF THE SOLUTIONS OF THE PROBLEMS OF A COMMUNITY, AND ITS CONSEQUENT UNFOLDING THAT LEADS TO THE THEORY OF POLITICAL POWER.
476	USING A SAMPLE OF GDRS CROSS-LISTED IN LONDON, WE REVISIT THE DEBATE REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE MARKET SEGMENTATION AND THE BONDING HYPOTHESES FOR A CROSS-LISTING PHENOMENON. UNLIKE PRIOR STUDIES THAT RELIED ON EMERGING/DEVELOPED MARKET PARTITIONING OF COUNTRIES, WE USE EQUITY TRADING COSTS TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF MARKET SEGMENTATION, WHICH IS A MORE DIRECT AND LESS NOISY MEASURE OF THIS CONSTRUCT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS LITTLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THIS METRIC AND THE LEVEL OF HOME-COUNTRY INVESTOR PROTECTION FOR EXAMINED GDRS, THEREFORE PROVIDING STRONGER SETTINGS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE SEGMENTATION AND BONDING EXPLANATIONS. WE FIND THAT LEGAL BONDING MECHANISMS AND REDUCTION IN SEGMENTATION HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CHANGES IN FIRM VALUE UPON CROSS-LISTING, WHEN EXAMINED AS STANDALONE FRAMEWORKS. NEXT, WE REPORT THAT THESE TWO FRAMEWORKS HAVE A JOINT, COMPLEMENTARY IMPACT ON CHANGES IN FIRM VALUE UPON CROSS-LISTING, BASED ON THE COUNTRY-LEVEL RULE OF LAW METRIC. CONVERSELY, WE FIND THAT THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITY AND CHANGES IN FIRM VALUE UPON CROSS-LISTING IS LESS SIGNIFICANT FOR COUNTRIES FROM THE MOST SEGMENTED MARKETS. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT ANALYSTS FOLLOWING [ACCURACY] IS AN EFFECTIVE REPUTATIONAL BONDING MECHANISM FOR FIRMS FROM THE MOST [LEAST] SEGMENTED MARKETS PRIMARILY AFTER CROSS-LISTING. THIS STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN MAJOR VALUATION THEORIES AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF BONDING MECHANISMS IN THE CASE OF CROSS-LISTING. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.

477	THIS PAPER IS A DEFENCE, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A TRADE UNIONIST, OF FERRAJOLIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM REGARDING SOCIAL RIGHTS IN GENERAL AND, SPECIFICALLY, WORKERS' RIGHTS, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE CURRENT PROCESS OF THE UNDERMINING OF SUCH RIGHTS AND THE WEAKENING AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF LABOUR LAW IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS ITALY. THE AUTHOR ADVOCATES THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF LABOUR RIGHTS AS SUBSTANTIVE LIMITS ON MAJORITARIAN DECISIONS (AGAINST BOTH TRADE UNION MAJORITIES AND THE LEGISLATURE); THE UNIVERSALITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF SUCH RIGHTS (WHICH ARE NOT SECOND-RATE RIGHTS); AND EVEN THE DEPENDENCE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIBERTY RIGHTS ON SOCIAL RIGHTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FORMAL CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SOCIO-LABOUR RIGHTS, THEIR SUBSTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS ARE BEING VIOLATED BY THE CURRENT POWER OF FREE-MARKET ECONOMY, THE PRIVATIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, THE WORSENING OF WORK CONDITIONS, THE RETURN TO INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTING AGAINST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING, THE DOMINANCE OF GDP AS THE MAIN PARAMETER FOR SOCIAL WELFARE, AND SO ON. WE ARE ALSO WITNESSING A LEGAL FORMALIZATION OF THE MENTIONED UNDERMINING OF WORKERS' CONDITIONS (WITHERING AWAY OF THE ORIGINAL ROLE OF LABOUR LAW, WHICH IS BEING ASSIMILATED TO COMMERCIAL LAW), AS WELL AS AN IDEOLOGICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THAT PROCESS OF MARKET DOMINANCE. THE SOLUTION TO THIS SITUATION IS NOT LESS BUT MORE-MORE INTENSE AND MORE EFFECTIVE-CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SOCIAL RIGHTS, IN THE DIRECTION TOWARDS A "SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW".
478	THE PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF USING THE COGNITIVE MAPPING METHOD TO ANALYZE THE MESSAGES FROM VIDEO BLOGGERS WHICH WERE POPULAR AMONG RUSSIAN YOUTH AND COVERED PROTEST ACTIONS IN RUSSIA IN 2019-2020. THE COGNITIVE MAPPING METHOD HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN USED TO INTERPRET THE INFORMATION MESSAGES OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROTEST MOVEMENT IN MODERN RUSSIA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE VALUE SYSTEMS, PRIORITIES, INDIVIDUAL LOGICAL CHAINS OF OPINION LEADERS IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE SEGMENT OF YOUTUBE VIDEO HOSTING. THE RESEARCH SAMPLE WAS BASED ON A TWO-STEP MODEL, INCLUDING THE SELECTION OF 20 VIDEO BLOGGERS WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST POPULAR AMONG RUSSIAN PROTEST YOUTH AS WELL AS THE SELECTION OF INFORMATION MATERIALS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. FOR EACH LEADER OF PUBLIC OPINION, SEVERAL COGNITIVE MAPS WERE BUILT REGARDING THE COVERAGE OF PROTEST ACTIONS IN 3 CASES (THE PROTESTS IN YEKATERINBURG IN 2019, IN MOSCOW AFTER THE MOSCOW CITY DUMA ELECTIONS IN 2019 AND IN KHABAROVSK IN 2020). THE COGNITIVE MAPPING METHOD MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ANALYZE THE PERCEPTION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE PROTEST ACTIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC OPINION LEADERS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE RULING PARTY. THE RESULTS OF COGNITIVE MAPPING REVEAL THE VALUE SYSTEMS OF THE INTERPRETERS OF POLITICAL EVENTS WHO ARE POPULAR AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. THE SYSTEM OF VALUES, EXPRESSED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF PROTEST ACTIONS, PRESUPPOSES THE DOMINANCE OF LIBERAL GUIDELINES, IDEAS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY.
479	THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL DATA REFLECTING ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND IN PARTICULAR THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA EMITTED AS A BY-PRODUCT OF PEOPLE'S USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES AND SERVICES, HAS BOTH POLITICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WAY PEOPLE ARE SEEN AND TREATED BY THE STATE AND BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. YET THE DATA REVOLUTION IS SO FAR PRIMARILY A TECHNICAL ONE: THE POWER OF DATA TO SORT, CATEGORISE AND INTERVENE HAS NOT YET BEEN EXPLICITLY CONNECTED TO A SOCIAL JUSTICE AGENDA BY THE AGENCIES AND AUTHORITIES INVOLVED. MEANWHILE, ALTHOUGH DATA-DRIVEN DISCRIMINATION IS ADVANCING AT A SIMILAR PACE TO DATA PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES, AWARENESS AND MECHANISMS FOR COMBATING IT ARE NOT. THIS PAPER POSITS THAT JUST AS AN IDEA OF JUSTICE IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW, AN IDEA OF DATA JUSTICE - FAIRNESS IN THE WAY PEOPLE ARE MADE VISIBLE, REPRESENTED AND TREATED AS A RESULT OF THEIR PRODUCTION OF DIGITAL DATA - IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE ETHICAL PATHS THROUGH A DATAFYING WORLD. BRINGING TOGETHER THE EMERGING SCHOLARLY PERSPECTIVES ON THIS TOPIC, I PROPOSE THREE PILLARS AS THE BASIS OF A NOTION OF INTERNATIONAL DATA JUSTICE: (IN)VISIBILITY, (DIS)ENGAGEMENT WITH TECHNOLOGY AND ANTIDISCRIMINATION. THESE PILLARS INTEGRATE POSITIVE WITH NEGATIVE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND BY DOING SO CHALLENGE BOTH THE BASIS OF CURRENT DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS AND THE GROWING ASSUMPTION THAT BEING VISIBLE THROUGH THE DATA WE EMIT IS PART OF THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL CONTRACT.
480	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF NATIONAL COURTS IN REDUCING THE 'SECURITY GAP' IN THE CONTEXT OF ARMED CONFLICTS. JUDGES IN DEMOCRATIC STATES ASSUME DIFFERENT ROLES. THEY MAY VARIOUSLY SERVE AS A LEGITIMATING AGENT OF THE STATE; AVOID EXERCISING JURISDICTION FOR EXTRA-LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS; DEFER TO OTHER BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT; ENFORCE THE LAW IN LINE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL; OR DEVELOP THE LAW AND INTRODUCE FORMS OF ETHICAL JUDGMENT THAT GO BEYOND POSITIVE APPLICATION OF THE LAW. IDENTIFYING THE VARIOUS ROLES ASSUMED BY NATIONAL JUDICIARIES, THEIR INSTITUTIONAL LIMITS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE EXECUTIVE OFFERS A USEFUL TOOL FOR ASSESSING THEIR POTENTIAL ROLE IN ADVANCING HUMAN SECURITY. IN RELATION TO THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN SECURITY, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL NOTIONS OF SECURITY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY BLURRED, WHEREBY 'INTERNAL' IMPLIES JUDICIAL GUARANTEES AND HUMAN RIGHTS BASED SECURITY AND 'EXTERNAL' IMPLIES WAR-BASED SECURITY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CHANGING ROLES OF NATIONAL COURTS IN SITUATIONS OF ARMED CONFLICT THAT ARE EXPLORED IN THE ARTICLE COULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A METHOD FOR STRENGTHENING HUMAN SECURITY. THE ANALYSIS OF ISRAELI AND US CASES INVOLVING TARGETED KILLINGS SUGGESTS THAT WHILE NATIONAL COURTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY RELUCTANT TO LIMIT GOVERNMENT ACTION AND HAVE TENDED TO APPLY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN A SELECTIVE MANNER, THEY HAVE NONETHELESS BECOME INCREASINGLY WILLING TO REVIEW ARMED CONFLICT CASES, INCLUDING STATE ACTION BEYOND ITS TERRITORIAL BORDERS.
481	'IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO DEFENCE: SO WE ARE TOLD FROM AN EARLY STAGE IN OUR LEGAL STUDIES. OR, TO BE MORE ACCURATE, IGNORANCE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW IS NO DEFENCE TO A CRIMINAL CHARGE.' THAT APPEARS TO BE THE RULE IN THIS COUNTRY, APART FROM A COUPLE OF WELL-ESTABLISHED EXCEPTIONS AND ANOTHER POSSIBLE ONE. I WILL ARGUE THAT IT IS A PREPOSTEROUS DOCTRINE, RESTING ON INSECURE FOUNDATIONS WITHIN THE CRIMINAL LAW AND ON QUESTIONABLE PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THE POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND OF THE STATE. IN DEVELOPING THESE ARGUMENTS, I WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO THE DIFFERING PROBLEMS OF IGNORANCE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW IN THREE BROAD AREAS REGULATORY OFFENCES, SERIOUS CRIME, AND OFFENCES OF OMISSION WITH A VIEW TO SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MORE THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO IF THE ISSUE OF IGNORANCE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW IS TO BE DEALT WITH ADEQUATELY AND FAIRLY. I BEGIN BY SCRUTINISING THE RELEVANT RULE OF ENGLISH CRIMINAL LAW AND THE JUSTIFICATIONS OFFERED FOR IT. I THEN GO ON TO SITUATE THE 'IGNORANCE-OF-LAW' DOCTRINE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THOSE BASTIONS OF LIBERAL CRIMINAL LAW THEORY PART THREE THEN EXPLORES THE THREE BROAD AREAS OF THE CRIMINAL LAW, AND PARTS FOUR AND FIVE CARRY THE DEBATE INTO THE POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND OF THE STATE IN THESE MATTERS.
482	IN NOVEMBER 2007, THE HEADS OF THE TEN MEMBER GOVERNMENTS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH-EAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN) SIGNED A CHARTER THAT WILL, ONCE RATIFIED, GIVE THE ASSOCIATION A LEGAL PERSONALITY. THE CHARTER, SIGNIFICANTLY, REQUIRES MORE OF ITS MEMBERS THAN A REASSERTION OF THE TRADITIONAL ASEAN NORM OF NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE PRACTICE OF CONSENSUS. THE CHARTER LISTS A NUMBER OF NOVEL GOALS AMONG THE ORGANIZATION'S PURPOSES: 'TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY, ENHANCE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.' IN VIEW OF THE WIDE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES OF ASEAN, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY WOULD IN FACT FACILITATE ASEAN'S GOAL OF BECOMING AN INTEGRATED POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SECURITY COMMUNITY. RATHER THAN ENHANCING AN INTEGRATED COMMUNITY, DEMOCRATIZATION WOULD ARGUABLY CREATE A FAULTLINE BETWEEN THE MORE POLITICALLY MATURE AND ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED STATES AND A NORTHERN TIER OF LESS DEVELOPED, AUTHORITARIAN SINGLE-PARTY DOMINANT REGIMES IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA. MOREOVER, GIVEN CHINA'S EMERGING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE TO THE REGION, SUCH A STRATEGY WOULD, AS IF BY AN INVISIBLE HAND, DRAW THE MORE AUTHORITARIAN ASEAN STATES INTO CHINA'S LESS THAN DEMOCRATIC EMBRACE. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT RATHER THAN STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY, ASEAN'S CHARTER NEEDS URGENTLY TO REINFORCE PRACTICES OF RULE GOVERNANCE AND MECHANISMS OF MARKET INTEGRATION TO ENHANCE BOTH ASEAN'S ECONOMIC PROFILE AS WELL AS THE REGION'S AUTONOMY.
483	IMPROVING SMALL-SCALE FISHERS' WELLBEING IS A CORE POLICY OBJECTIVE IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE JUST, EQUITABLE AND SUS-TAINABLE FUTURES. NONETHELESS, FISHERS' WELLBEING IS RARELY ASSESSED OR MONITORED OVER TIME USING QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS. WE EVALUATED THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND EVOLUTION OF TWO SMALL-SCALE FISHING COMMUNITIES OF NORTHERN PERU USING THE SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS APPROACH. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS WERE USED TO CHARACTERIZE FISHERS FINANCIAL, HUMAN, NATURAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL CAPITALS. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A SIMPLE, YET NOVEL, COMPOSITE INDEX TO QUANTIFY FISHERS' UNSATISFIED BASIC NEEDS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWED US TO GRASP CHANGES IN THE MATERIAL AND RELATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF FISHERS' WELLBEING OVER TIME. FISHERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAD: (I) LOW HUMAN AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL ASSETS, (II) STRONG SOCIAL CAPITAL ASSETS, AND (III) EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR PHYSICAL CAPITAL ASSETS WHILST REPORTING DECLINES IN THEIR NATURAL CAPITAL ASSETS. ALTHOUGH FISHERS MAINLY USE HIGHLY SE-LECTIVE, LOW-IMPACT FISHING METHODS, THEIR TARGET STOCKS AND INCOMES ARE DECLINING. PEOPLE'S WELLBEING IN THESE COMMUNITIES WAS HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL (E.G., EL NIN SIMILAR TO O) AND ECONOMIC (E.G., ACCESS TO MARKETS) DRIVERS AS WELL AS POOR GOVERNANCE (E.G., WEAK RULE OF LAW, LOW INSTITUTIONAL FIT, CORRUPTION). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SMALL-SCALE FISHERS OF THESE TWO SITES ARE CURRENTLY IN A SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL TRAP, WITH MANY POINTS OF ENTRY AND FEW WAYS OUT. WE DISCUSS POTENTIAL AVENUES FOR ESCAPING THE TRAP AND IMPROVING THEIR WELLBEING BASED ON COMMONLY SUGGESTED LIVELIHOODS STRATEGIES FOUND IN THE LITERATURE.
484	THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) CASE R V LEE (2010) EWCA CRIM 1404 RESULTED IN A PHARMACIST BEING CONVICTED FOR AN INADVERTENT DISPENSING ERROR AND PAVED WAY FOR THE DECRIMINALISATION OF SUCH ERRORS BY WAY OF A DUE DILIGENCE DEFENCE ENACTED IN 2018. IN RELATION TO HONG KONG (HK), WHAT IS ITS LEGAL POSITION FOR DISPENSING ERRORS, AND CAN IT FOLLOW THE DECRIMINALISING STEPS OF UK? THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE WHETHER AND HOW HK CAN REACH THE NORMATIVE POSITION FOR A DISPENSING ERROR LEGAL REGIME: (1) I POSIT THAT THE NORMATIVE POSITION FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) LIABILITY FOR DISPENSING ERRORS SHOULD PRIORITISE THE PUBLIC INTEREST OF MINIMISATION OF FUTURE DISPENSING ERRORS OVER THE RETRIBUTION OF PAST WRONGS; (2) I ILLUSTRATE HK'S CURRENT POSITION FOR THE LIABILITIES OF HCPS ON DISPENSING ERRORS, FOCUSING ANALYSIS ON THE RELATIVELY CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF HK'S CRIMINAL LIABILITY, REFERENCING THE LANDMARK CASES HIN LIN YEE V HKSAR (2009) 13 HKCFAR 142 AND KULEMESIN V HKSAR (2013) 16 HKCFAR 195 TO ASSIST MY ANALYSIS OF THE REQUISITE MENTAL ELEMENT FOR RELEVANT STATUTORY OFFENCES; (3) THROUGH COMPARISON WITH UK'S DEVELOPMENT POST-R V LEE AND APPLICATION OF RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES, HK'S CURRENT POSITION IS CRITIQUED, COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHILE THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS FOR THE DECRIMINALISATION OF DISPENSING ERRORS IN HK, THE PREREQUISITE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IS AN OVERHAUL OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS BY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY.
485	THE TASK OF EVERY GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND GOODS FOR CITIZENS AND TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC ORDER. THEREFORE, THE COMBINATION OF LEGISLATION, THE JUDICIARY AND ADMINISTRATION IS INEVITABLE. MOREOVER, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS MUST TRANSFORM THE WAY THEY FUNCTION BY USING MORE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO REMAIN RESPONSIVE AND EFFICIENT. THIS CHALLENGE WAS FURTHER REVEALED DURING LOCKDOWNS IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, WHICH AFFECTED THEIR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE SOLUTION TO THAT CHALLENGE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IT ALSO INCREASES INNOVATION IN GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AS WELL AS EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS BY OFFERING MORE PARTICIPATIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO CITIZENS. HENCE, A MATURE LEVEL OF E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT ALSO ARISES. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE LEVELS OF E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE EU-28. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF E-GOVERNMENT MATURITY ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE EU-28. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN EMPIRICAL RESULTS, A TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARE REGRESSION (2SLS) WAS APPLIED. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT E-GOVERNMENT MATURITY POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO ENHANCING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY IN THE EU-28. IN ADDITION, THE RULE OF LAW PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EACH STAGE REGRESSION MODEL. BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT E-GOVERNMENT IS INEVITABLE AND SHOULD ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
486	CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN AFRICA'S PEACE, SECURITY, AND PROSPERITY. THE AFRICAN CONTINENT, WITH SOME OF THE WORLD'S FASTEST-GROWING ECONOMIES, AN EXPANDING CONSUMER BASE, AND AN EXPLODING YOUTH POPULATION, HAS RECENTLY WITNESSED INTENSIFYING CHINA-U.S. COMPETITION. IN ECONOMIC AND TRADE TERMS, THE UNITED STATES IS PLAYING CATCH-UP AS BEIJING HAS LONG AGO OVERTAKEN WASHINGTON AS THE CONTINENT'S LARGEST TRADING PARTNER AND INVESTOR. WHILE CHINA REGARDS AFRICA'S ADHERENCE TO THE "ONE CHINA" PRINCIPLE AS THE ONLY POLITICAL PREREQUISITE FOR ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CONTINENT, THE UNITED STATES VIEWS GREATER DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA AS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF BOTH. CHINA'S SECURITY PRESENCE IN AFRICA PALES IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF THE UNITED STATES, AS WASHINGTON BOASTS AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF MILITARY BASES ON THE CONTINENT WHILE BEIJING'S PEACE AND SECURITY ENGAGEMENT MAINLY INVOLVES MULTILATERAL UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS AND BILATERAL SECURITY COOPERATION, SUCH AS ARMS SALES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, GROWING CHINA-U.S. COMPETITION DOES NOT NECESSARILY CROWD OUT SHARED INTERESTS OR PRECLUDE CLOSER COORDINATION IN SPECIFIC AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE, MARKET DEVELOPMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING, ANTI-PIRACY, HEALTH CAPACITY-BUILDING, AND SO ON. BY FENDING OFF A SENSELESS IDEOLOGICAL CONTEST, RESPECTING EACH OTHER'S CORE INTERESTS IN AFRICA, ACCOMMODATING AFRICANS' DEVELOPMENT ASPIRATIONS AND SECURITY CONCERNS, BEIJING AND WASHINGTON CAN FIND MORE COMMON GROUND THAN MANY BELIEVE.
487	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF CHINESE INVESTMENT ABROAD, AND PARTICULARLY THE ROLE OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE (SOE) INVESTORS, IN TWO WAYS. FIRSTLY, WE IDENTIFY MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE LITERATURE STEMMING FROM WIDE-SPREAD DATA DEFICIENCIES IN DATA. SPECIFICALLY, THE RELIABILITY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH RESULTS HAS BEEN LIMITED BY DATA SETS THAT DO NOT IDENTIFY THE FINAL DESTINATION FOR CHINESE INVESTMENT, NOR SUITABLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DIFFERENT OWNERSHIP TYPES. BY AUGMENTING THE PROJECT-LEVEL DATA FROM THE CHINA GLOBAL INVESTMENT TRACKER WITH DETAILED OWNERSHIP INFORMATION FOR EACH FIRM, THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT LARGE-SCALE INVESTMENT IN NATURAL RESOURCE INVESTMENT, WHICH SURGED AFTER 2008, IS DOMINATED BY STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES CONTROLLED BY CHINA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IT ALSO REVEALS A NEWER WAVE OF NON-RESOURCE INVESTMENT AFTER 2009 IN WHICH NON-STATE ENTERPRISE PLAYS THE LEADING ROLE. FURTHER, WE INVESTIGATE THE DESTINATION SELECTION OF LARGE-SCALE CHINESE INVESTMENT TO 192 COUNTRIES FROM 2005 TO 2015 TO TEST THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOES MIGHT BE ATTRACTED TO POORER INSTITUTIONAL HOST ENVIRONMENTS. WE FIND THAT CHINESE SOE INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES, REGARDLESS OF OWNERSHIP TYPE IS ATTRACTED TO COUNTRIES WITH POLITICAL STABILITY, BUT IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW MEASURE. FOR NON-RESOURCE INVESTMENT, WE FIND NO STRONG INSTITUTIONAL PREFERENCES. WE THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT PREVIOUS FINDINGS OF DIFFERENT INVESTMENT MOTIVATIONS BETWEEN STATE- AND NON-STATE INVESTORS LIKELY REFLECTS THE DOMINANCE OF STATE-OWNERSHIP IN RESOURCE SECTORS, RATHER THAN DIFFERENT INVESTMENT BEHAVIOUR BASED ON OWNERSHIP.
488	AFTER A CENTURY IN THE MAKING, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) CAME INTO EXISTENCE IN 2002 WITH AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF STATES RATIFYING THE ROME STATUTE. WITH 34 SIGNATORIES, AFRICA IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR IN THE ASSEMBLY OF STATE PARTIES, YET AFRICA HAS BECOME ITS SEVEREST CRITIC. AS THREATS OF WITHDRAWAL BECOME A REALITY WITH THE IMMINENT WITHDRAWAL OF BURUNDI, THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AFRICA HAS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. WITH AN AFRICAN UNION (AU) CONSTITUTIVE ACT PURPORTING A COMMITMENT TO COMBATING IMPUNITY AND PROMOTING DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE, ONE WOULD EXPECT THE AU TO BE READY TO PICK UP THE REINS. TO END IMPUNITY AND HOLD PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE, FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE LACUNA LEFT IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ICC HAS NEVER BEEN MORE PRESSING. THE RECENT ADOPTION OF A STRATEGY BY AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR A MASS WITHDRAWAL HAS PUSHED THE MATTER TO THE FORE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY OF AMNESTY, DOMESTIC AND LOCAL TRIALS, OR AN AFRICAN REGIONAL COURT AS VIABLE ALTERNATIVES TO ICC JURISDICTION AND PROSECUTION. THE CREATION OF AN AFRICAN REGIONAL COURT IN THE GUISE OF THE AFRICAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHT (ACJHR) SEEMS THE PREFERRED SOLUTION, ENABLED BY THE MALABO PROTOCOL EXTENDING ITS JURISDICTION TO INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIMES. SLOW RATIFICATION DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE PROPOSED ACJHR AND ITS EXTENDED JURISDICTION. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND WHATEVER SOLUTION IS FOUND WILL NECESSITATE DECISIVE ACTION BY THE AU.
489	THE UNSETTLING FIGURE OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS HAS MOTIVATED THE INTELLECT AND THE IMAGINATION OF ACADEMICS AND ARTISTS OF ALL KINDS, WHO HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE SETTINGS, AND THE HUMAN DYNAMICS THEY FOSTER. PHILOSOPHER GIORGIO AGAMBEN HAS SOUGHT THIS UNDERSTANDING BASED ON HIS THEORIZATION OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION, WHICH ALLOWS THE SOVEREIGN (THE STATE) TO SUSPEND THE RULE OF LAW, SO AS TO FACILITATEAN EXTRAJUDICIAL WAY OF ACTING, THIS BEING NONETHELESS VALIDATED BY THE POWER THE STATE IS ENTITLED TO EXERT. IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS EXCEPTIONALITY IS A CONSTANT FACTOR, WHICH ENCOURAGES CERTAIN SOCIAL FORMS AND BEHAVIOURS THAT OVERSTEP WHAT WOULD BE THE "USUAL" FORMS AND WAYS OF ACTING. THE FILM SOPHIE'S CHOICE BY ALAN PAKULA, ALIKE THE NOVEL BY THE SAME NAME IT IS BASED ON, PRESENTS US WITH A SCENARIO THAT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED AS A MATTER OF DECISION-MAKING WHEN FACED WITH AN ETHICAL DILEMMA (CHOOSING BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH REGARDING THE MAIN CHARACTER'S OWN CHILDREN) IN AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU CONCENTRATION CAMPS. IN VIEW OF ALL THE ANALYSES THAT TRY TO EXPLAIN THE ISSUESTHAT STEM FROM ETHICAL DILEMMAS, THIS PAPER, FOLLOWING THE AGAMBENEAN THEORY, ARGUES THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS, GIVEN THAT THE TRADITIONAL LEGAL ORDER HAS BEEN SUSPENDED, MORAL DISCERNMENT HAS BEEN BLOCKED, AND HENCE WHAT DOES APPEARIS BEHAVIOUR THAT SIMPLY ADAPTS ITSELFTO THE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVAIL.
490	ACCORDING TO THE CODE OF GOOD PRACTICE IN ELECTORAL MATTERS, ADOPTED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION, THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF ELECTORAL LAW SHOULD BE CLOSED TO AMENDMENT LESS THAN ONE YEAR BEFORE AN ELECTION OR BE WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION OR AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN ORDINARY LAW. UNFORTUNATELY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND ELECTORAL CODE DO NOT PROTECT THE STABILITY OF THE LAW TO A SUFFICIENT EXTENT. LACK OF RESTRICTIONS CAUSED IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE OF THE AFFAIRS, WHERE THE ELECTORAL LAW HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY MODIFIED JUST BEFORE THE ELECTIONS, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULAR INTERESTS OF RULING PARTY. HOWEVER, IN 2006 THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL REFERRED POSITIVELY TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE VENICE COMMISSION AND INTRODUCE TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE PRINCIPLE OF STABILITY OF ELECTORAL LAW, RELATED TO DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. FROM THIS MOMENT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE ELECTORAL LAW MUST BE ADOPTED AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION, UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY AS THE ACT OF VOTING, BUT AS A WHOLE THE ACTIVITIES COVERED BY THE ELECTORAL CALENDAR. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION: HOW WE SHOULD UNDERSTOOD THE TERM "FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE ELECTORAL LAW" AND HOW TO CALCULATE THE SIX MONTHS PERIOD, DURING WHICH ANY CHANGE OF ELECTORAL LAW ARE PROHIBIT. IT WILL BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION ALSO CRITICAL COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS THAT HAVE EMERGED DURING THE ADJUDICATE THE CONFORMITY OF STATUTES BY THE JUDGES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL.
491	ACT N DEGREES 18.987 AND DECREE 375/ 012 BROUGHT UP A DEBATE INVOLVING WOMEN'S RIGHT TO VOLUNTARY INTERRUPTION OF PREGNANCY AND THE RIGHT OF PHYSICIANS TO REFRAIN FROM PERFORMING IT, DUE TO MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS ISSUES. FROM A SECULAR AND BIOETHICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DETERMINE ARGUMENTS SEEKING FOR MINIMAL CONSENSUS THAT WILL RESPECT THE MORAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF ALL ACTORS. CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS THE REFUSAL TO PERFORM CERTAIN LEGAL, ENFORCEABLE ACTIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID A SERIOUS LESION IN THE PERSON ' S OWN CONSCIENCE. IT EVIDENCES RESPECT TO FREEDOM OF IDEAS AND RELIGION BY A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL ACT THAT DOES NOT AIM TO CHANGE THE LAW, AND NEITHER DOES IT SEEK FOR OTHERS TO REVISE THEIR DECISION. IT IS DIFFERENT FROM CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE SINCE IT CONSISTS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO STATE THEY DO NOT WANT TO OBSERVE A LEGAL PROVISION, IT AIMS TO ABOLISH IT AND TO EXERT A GROUP PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PRINCIPLISMBIOETHICS: A) THERE IS RESPECT FORWOMEN'S AUTONOMYWHO DECIDE TO INTERRUPT THEIR PREGNANCY ACCORDING TO THE LEGAL PROVISIONS IN FORCE; B) ACCESS OF WOMEN TO VOLUNTARY INTERRUPTION OF PREGNANCY UNDER THE HEALTH TEAM CONTROL IS CONNECTED TO THE BENEFICENCE AND NONMALEFICENCE PRINCIPLES; C) THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW IN THE ENTIRENATIONAL INTEGRATEDHEALTH SYSTEM GUARANTEES WOMEN'S UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO THESE SERVICES, ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE PRINCIPLE.
492	COURTHOUSES ARE ONE OF THE FOUNDING PILLARS OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW, BEING A SOVEREIGN BODY. BUT COURTHOUSES ARE NOT JUST BUILDINGS WHERE JUSTICE IS APPLIED, ADMINISTERED, AND WRITTEN. FROM MAX WEBER ON, COURTS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE URBAN DIMENSION AND THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE CITIES. AS IN A MIRROR GAME, BOTH CITY AND COURT BUILDING LOOK AT EACH OTHER, BOTH SHAPE EACH OTHER, THEY BELONG TO ONE ANOTHER. AND YET, HOW OFTEN DO WE THINK OF THEIR INTIMATE INTERACTIONS? HAVING THIS IN MIND, AND BY EXAMINING A NUMBER OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPARATE CASES, I INTEND TO DISCUSS CORRELATED VARIATIONS OF THE MIRROR GAME BETWEEN CITY AND COURTHOUSE BUILDING, WHERE VARIABLES SUCH AS THE PROXEMICS OF THE COURTHOUSE', THE (DIS)ALIGNMENT AMID CENTRE AND PERIPHERY, THE SENSE OF LOSS' AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONTROL/DISCIPLINE WILL BE CENTRAL TO COMPREHEND THE COURT/CITY' NARRATIVES INVOLVED. SUCH SEMIOTIC ANALYSIS AIMS TO FOSTER REFLECTION ON THE SOCIO-POLITICAL WEIGHT THE LOCATION OF THE COURT-THE CONNECTIONS OF THE BUILDING (COMPRISING ITS ARCHITECTURE) AND THE CITY-MAY EXPRESS. I CONCLUDE BY ARGUING THAT COURTHOUSE BUILDINGS MUST REDISCOVER THEIR PLACE AND LEGITIMACY, NOT ONLY IN THE COMMUNITY'S COLLECTIVE IMAGINATION, BUT ALSO IN THE URBAN SPACE, PROMOTING A CLOSER DIALOGUE WITH THE CITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, AS ESSENTIAL AXES OF CITY LIFE. PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN THE LIKELY WAY FORWARD SUGGESTS A DIGITAL TRAJECTORY, POSSIBLY WITHOUT THE NEED FOR BUILDINGS.
493	ONLINE LEGAL CONSULTATION PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MODERN RULE-OF-LAW SOCIETY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION OF LEGAL CONSULTATION OF USERS WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGE EXPRESSIONS AND LEGAL KNOWLEDGE BACKGROUND. A CRITICAL ISSUE IS A METHOD THROUGH WHICH USERS' LEGAL CONSULTATION DATA ARE CLASSIFIED AND THE FEATURE OF EACH CATEGORY IS EXTRACTED. TRADITIONAL CLASSIFICATION METHODS RELY CONSIDERABLY ON LEXICAL AND SYNTACTIC FEATURES AND FREQUENTLY REQUIRE STRICT SENTENCE FORMATTING, WHICH ELIMINATES SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY AND MAY NOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE. WE AIM TO EXTRACT THE PATTERNS OF USERS' CONSULTATION ON DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, WHICH MINIMALLY DEPEND ON LEXICAL, SYNTAX, AND SENTENCE FORMATTING. HOWEVER, RESEARCH IN THIS AREA HAS RARELY BEEN CONDUCTED IN PREVIOUS LEGAL ADVISORY SERVICE STUDIES. IN THIS STUDY, A CLASSIFICATION APPROACH FOR MULTICLASS USERS' INTENTION BASED ON PATTERN-ORIENTED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION AND BI-LSTM IS PROPOSED, AND EACH USER'S LEGAL CONSULTING STATEMENT IS EXPRESSED AS A TENSOR. MOREOVER, WE PROPOSE A PATTERN-ORIENTED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION METHOD THAT CAN OBTAIN A CORE TENSOR THAT APPROXIMATES THE PATTERNS OF USERS' CONSULTATION. THESE PATTERNS CAN IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF CLASSIFYING USERS' INTENTION OF LEGAL CONSULTATION. WE USE BI-LSTM TO AUTOMATICALLY LEARN AND OPTIMIZE THESE PATTERNS. EVIDENTLY, BI-LSTM WITH A PATTERN-ORIENTED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION LAYER PERFORMS BETTER THAN A RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK ONLY. RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE PREVIOUS WORK, AND THE FACTOR MATRIX AND CORE TENSOR CALCULATED BY THE PATTERN-ORIENTED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION ARE INTERPRETABLE.
494	OBJECTIVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RACE AND CRIME HAS BEEN CONTENTIOUS, FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON OFFENDING AND INCARCERATION PATTERNS AMONG MINORITIES. THERE HAS BEEN SOME LIMITED WORK ON PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT, AND FINDINGS SHOW THAT WHILE MINORITIES BELIEVE IN THE ROLE AND RULE OF LAW, THEY SIMULTANEOUSLY PERCEIVE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS ACTING IN A BIASED AND/OR UNFAIR MANNER. TWO LIMITATIONS HAVE STALLED THIS LITERATURE. FIRST, RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON CRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS TO THE NEGLECT OF NONCRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS. SECOND, MOST STUDIES HAVE NOT EXAMINED WHETHER RACE REMAINS SALIENT AFTER CONSIDERING OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES OR DISCRIMINATION AND LEGITIMACY ATTITUDES. METHODS USING DATA FROM 400 ADULTS, WE EXAMINE HOW RACE AFFECTS PERCEPTIONS OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT AND SUBSEQUENT REINSTATEMENT INTO THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN THE CASE OF MICHAEL VICK, A STAR PROFESSIONAL QUARTERBACK WHO PLED GUILTY TO CHARGES OF OPERATING AN ILLEGAL DOG-FIGHTING RING. RESULTS FINDINGS SHOW THAT WHITES ARE MORE LIKELY TO VIEW VICK'S PUNISHMENT AS TOO SOFT AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE REINSTATED, WHILE NONWHITES HAD THE OPPOSITE VIEWS. RACE REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER CONTROLLING FOR OTHER VARIABLES BELIEVED TO BE RELATED TO PUNISHMENT PERCEPTIONS. CONCLUSION ATTITUDES TOWARD BOTH CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT AND NFL REINSTATEMENT VARY ACROSS RACE SUCH THAT THERE EXISTS IMPORTANT DIVIDES IN HOW INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVE THE SYSTEM METING OUT PUNISHMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY REINTEGRATING OFFENDERS BACK INTO SOCIETY. THESE RESULTS UNDERSCORE THAT WHITE AND NONWHITES PERCEIVE THE LAW AND ITS ADMINISTRATION DIFFERENTLY.
495	THE AMERICAN VERSION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT TYRANNY (I.E., CAPRICIOUS, ARBITRARY RULE) AND TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW BY PREVENTING THE CONCENTRATION OF ALL POWERS IN ANY ONE BRANCH. THAT LEGISLATORS, AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE IMPARTIAL ADMINISTRATION AND ADJUDICATION OF LAWS WHICH THEY PASSED WAS A KEY FACTOR IN ASSURING THESE OBJECTIVES. WHILE CONGRESS WAS REGARDED AS THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE AND POWERFUL BRANCH IN THE SYSTEM, OVER THE COURSE OF AMERICAN HISTORY PRESIDENTIAL POWERS HAVE INCREASED ENORMOUSLY, OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF CONGRESS. THE EMERGENCE AND GROWTH OF POLITICAL PARTIES HAS FACILITATED THIS DEVELOPMENT SO THAT TODAY THE PRESIDENCY IS THE PREDOMINANT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, VIEWED AS REPRESENTING ALL THE PEOPLE, NOT SPECIAL OR NARROW INTERESTS. IN RECENT YEARS, A NEW AND EXPANSIVE THEORY OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY, "THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY,"HAS GAINED CURRENCY; A THEORY WHICH JUSTIFIES AN EVEN GREATER CONCENTRATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. MOREOVER, THE SUPREME COURT IN RECENT DECADES, LARGELY THROUGH AN EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF BOTH ITS FUNCTION AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION, HAS ASSUMED NEW POWER, AGAIN AT THE EXPENSE OF CONGRESS. WHILE THE CONSTITUTION HAS NOT BEEN AMENDED TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL DESIGN, THE REALITY IS THAT THE PRESENT SYSTEM DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THAT INTENDED BY THE FRAMERS. YET, THE CONCERNS POSED BY THE FRAMERS ABOUT A CONCENTRATION OF POWER REMAIN.
496	THE REGULATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND OTHER KINDS OF >> NEW << RISKS MAY BE REGARDED AS THE LATEST STAGE IN THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELDS AND INSTRUMENTS OF STATE REGULATION. THE AREAS OF STATE REGULATION HAVE EVOLVED FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW OVER PROVISIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL PREDICAMENTS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF COLLECTIVE RISK SITUATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF STATE REGULATION HAS CHANGED FROM LEGAL PREDICTABILITY OVER SOCIAL WELFARE TO THE PREVENTION OF RISK. IN THE COURSE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE >> LEGAL << OVER THE >> SOCIAL << TO THE >> PREVENTIVE STATE <<, THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTABLE SHIFTS IN THE INSTRUMENTS OF STATE REGULATION. WHILE THE LEGAL AND THE SOCIAL STATE ARE BASED ON COERCIVE POWER AND MONETARY REDISTRIBUTION, THE PREVENTIVE STATE'S MEDIUM OF STEERING IS KNOWLEDGE. YET KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RISK IS ALWAYS IMPERFECT AND UNCERTAIN KNOWLEDGE. THEREFORE, WE ARGUE THAT THE CAPACITY TO COPE WITH IGNORANCE AND UNCERTAINTY - RATHER THAN SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE PER SE - IS THE CRITICAL RESOURCE OF POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING IN RISK SOCIETY. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT RISKS CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ONCE AND FOR ALL. INSTEAD, STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS WHO ARE DEEMED CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THE INELUCTABLE UNCERTAINTIES ASSUME CRITICAL POSITIONS IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. THE EMERGING REGIME OF RISK REGULATION THEREFORE TRANSCENDS THE FRAMEWORK OF A WEBERIAN STATE APPARATUS BASED UPON >> AUTHORITY THROUGH KNOWLEDGE << BY GRANTING A RATHER PROMINENT ROLE TO FORMS OF AUTHORITY BASED UPON IGNORANCE AND UNCERTAINTY.
497	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DETERMINANTS OF FIRMS' EFFICIENCY AND DEVELOP OPTIMAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISK BENCHMARKS FOR THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISK DATA WERE ACQUIRED FROM INSTITUTIONAL SHAREHOLDER SERVICES EUROPE SA. DATA ON FIRMS' EFFICIENCY AND FOR EXPLANATORY AND CONTROL VARIABLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE DATASTREAM DATABASE. THE GENERALISED DIRECTIONAL DISTANCE FUNCTION DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (GDDF-DEA) MODEL AND ITS STOCHASTIC EXTENSION PROVIDED CORPORATE EFFICIENCY MEASURES AND OPTIMAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BENCHMARKS. THE AUTHORS USED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH WILD BOOTSTRAPPING TO TEST THE STUDY HYPOTHESES. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FIRMS' OPTIMAL AND ACTUAL EFFICIENCY INPUT/OUTPUT VARIABLES AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISKS IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR ACROSS COUNTRIES. INTERNAL FIRM CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS GROUP AFFILIATIONS, PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION AND INSIDER OWNERSHIP AND EXTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM, THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CULTURAL VALUES ARE VITAL DETERMINANTS OF FIRMS' EFFICIENCY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS PAPER PROVIDES VALUABLE GUIDANCE TO ENABLE CORPORATE MANAGERS, REGULATORS AND POLICYMAKERS TO ENHANCE FIRMS' EFFICIENCY AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER DEVELOPS OPTIMAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISK BENCHMARKS AND IDENTIFIES THE MOST CRITICAL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING FIRMS' EFFICIENCY IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. IT ALSO USED A NOVEL GDDF-DEA MODEL, WITH THE MULTI-PARAMETRIC MODEL FOR BIAS CORRECTION OF EFFICIENCY ESTIMATOR.
498	AFTER ALMOST 25 YEARS OF WHAT COULD JUSTIFIABLY BE CALLED TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA, A TRUISM IS THAT THE COUNTRY'S NEW LEGAL ORDER, ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN 1993 AND 1996, PROVIDES THE CRITICAL FOUNDATION OF PEACE AND SECURITY UPON WHICH ITS FREEDOM HAS BEEN BUILT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE SHAPING OF THE COUNTRY'S POSITION AS A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, UPHOLDING THE VALUES FOR WHICH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BLACK AND WHITE, HAD FOUGHT. THIS ARTICLE IS A BRIEF REFLECTION ON THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN ESTABLISHING THE MEANING OF THIS DEMOCRACY AND GIVING IT EFFECT. THE MAIN GOAL OF THE ARTICLE IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE COURT'S NEW JURISPRUDENCE WORKS IN PARTICULAR CONTEXTS, HOW ITS WORK IS RELATED TO CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE RIGHTS OF MARGINALISED GROUPS IN SOCIETY. USING THE EXAMPLES OF THE COURT'S DECISION IN MAKWANYANE ON THE DEATH PENALTY, AND THE COURT'S DECISION ON THE FINDINGS OF THE PUBLIC PROTECTOR'S REPORT ON NKANDLA, THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE COURT'S NEW JURISPRUDENCE TAKES QUITE A DIFFERENT VIEW OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, INSOFAR AS THE JURISPRUDENCE ENTRUSTS BROAD DISCRETION TO THE COURT AND EMPHASISES THE NEED FOR SUSTAINED LEADERSHIP OF THE COURT TO ADVANCE THE BATTLE FOR FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
499	DOES THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEE A HABEAS PRIVILEGE OR NOT? EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT APPEARED TO ANSWER THIS FOUNDATIONAL HABEAS QUESTION IN BOUMEDIENE V. BUSH, IT SEEMED TO HAVE UNCEREMONIOUSLY RESCINDED THAT ANSWER IN DHS V. THURAISSIGIAM. THIS PIECE, USING THURAISSIGIAM AS A STARTING POINT, LINKS THIS REMARKABLE DOCTRINAL INSTABILITY TO DEFICITS IN THE ASSOCIATED HABEAS THEORY: THE LEGAL COMMUNITY IS SHORT ON PERSUASIVE ACCOUNTS OF HOW THE CONSTITUTION "ORIGINATES" THE HABEAS PRIVILEGE. THE BASIC PROBLEM IS ROOTED IN THE TENSION BETWEEN A LITERALIST READING OF THE SUSPENSION CLAUSE, WHICH TEXTUALLY FORMULATES NOTHING MORE THAN AN ANTISUSPENSION RULE, AND OTHER INDICIA OF CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING THAT SUGGEST A BROADER HABEAS GUARANTEE-THINGS LIKE HISTORY, FRAMERS' INTENT, PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING, AND CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE. IF ONE BELIEVES THAT THE CONSTITUTION ENSHRINES THE PRIVILEGE, THEN A PUZZLE FOLLOWS: WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM THAT CREATES IT? THE LEGAL COMMUNITY HAS NOT COALESCED AROUND A COHERENT ORIGINATION THEORY, AND THE SUPREME COURT REFLEXIVELY ASSUMES THAT THE SUSPENSION CLAUSE MUST BE THE FONT OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL HABEAS LAW. THAT CASUAL ASSUMPTION UNDERMINES BASIC RULE OF LAW VIRTUES ASSOCIATED WITH CLARITY AND PREDICTABILITY. BECAUSE THE SUSPENSION CLAUSE IS SO ILL-SUITED TO ORIGINATION WORK (BOTH TEXTUALLY AND STRUCTURALLY), UNDERCOOKED THEORIES TREATING IT AS THE EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL HABEAS LAW HAVE SOWN CONFUSION. TO FACILITATE SOME DOCTRINAL STABILITY, THE LEGAL COMMUNITY OUGHT TO GENERATE STRONGER THEORIES ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW THE CONSTITUTION ORIGINATES THE HABEAS PRIVILEGE, AND THE SUPREME COURT OUGHT TO ADOPT ONE.
500	THE ARTICLE APPROXIMATES AND CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL ARGUMENTATION OF DEPUTIES CONTAINED IN THEIR SPEECHES AT THE SITTINGS OF THE SEJM OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND OF THE 8TH TERM (2015-2019). IT DISCUSSES CASES WHERE PARLIAMENTARIANS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REFERRED TO THE ASSUMPTIONS OF PARTICULAR PHILOSOPHICAL-LEGAL SCHOOLS; COMMENTED ON THE ESSENCE, FEATURES, GOALS AND VALUES OF LAW; ARGUED ABOUT THE OPTIMAL DEGREE OF POSITIVISATION OF MORAL NORMS; QUOTED PHILOSOPHERS. THE STUDY REVEALED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PARTY AFFILIATION OF MPS ON THEIR PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL ARGUMENTATION. DEPUTIES OF THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS REFERRED IN THEIR SPEECHES TO THE AXIOLOGY OF LAW AND NATURAL LAW, EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY IN THE PROCESS OF ENACTING AND APPLYING THE LAW, AND UNDERLINED THE ROLE OF SOCIAL LEGITIMACY OF NORMATIVE ACTS AND COURT RULINGS. ON THE OTHER HAND, MPS BELONGING TO THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION - ESPECIALLY THE CIVIC PLATFORM AND THE MODERN PARTY MEMBERS - HIGHLIGHTED THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW, OPPOSED BILLS PERCEIVED AS MORALISTIC AND CONFESSIONAL, AND SOUGHT IN JUSTICE AND EQUITY AS THE CRITERIA FOR JUDGEMENTS THE SOURCES OF EXCESSIVE JUDICIAL DISCRETION THAT THREATENED LEGAL CERTAINTY AND SECURITY. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, THE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD PHILOSOPHY OF LAW HAS A UTILITARIAN VALUE FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE. IT IS DESIRABLE, HOWEVER, THAT MPS' REMARKS OF A PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL NATURE SHOULD BE PART OF FACTUAL ARGUMENTATION, AND NOT REDUCED TO SUPERFICIAL RHETORIC OR LINGUISTIC ORNAMENTATION.
501	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS OF THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK REGULATING CABINET SECRECY IN CANADA AND PROPOSES SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THEM. THE FIRST SHORTCOMING IS THE INDETERMINACY OF THE TERM "CABINET CONFIDENCE" PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 39 OF THE CANADA EVIDENCE ACT AND 69 OF THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXECUTIVE HAS BROAD DISCRETION TO DELINEATE THE SCOPE OF CABINET IMMUNITY. THE SECOND SHORTCOMING STEMS FROM THE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT AND REVIEW MECHANISMS TO PREVENT AND CORRECT POSSIBLE ABUSES OF THIS IMMUNITY BY THE EXECUTIVE. BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE AND AN ANALYSIS OF BEST PRACTICES IN SIMILAR JURISDICTIONS, THE AUTHOR MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO MORE CLEARLY CIRCUMSCRIBE THE SCOPE OF CABINET IMMUNITY AND TO ENSURE THAT CLAIMS OF IMMUNITY ARE SUBJECT TO MEANINGFUL REVIEW BY AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL BODY. TO THAT END, HE PROPOSES A NARROWER IMMUNITY, BASED ON A CRITERION OF INJURY, THAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED ONLY FOLLOWING AN IN- DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE AUTHOR UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF EXCLUDING FROM THE SCOPE OF THE IMMUNITY ANY FACTUAL AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION UNDERPINNING GOVERNMENT DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC. FINALLY, HE RECOMMENDS THAT JUDGES AND THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER OF CANADA BE GRANTED THE POWER TO EXAMINE CABINET CONFIDENCES WHEN THERE IS A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF A CLAIM OF IMMUNITY, AND THAT JUDGES BE GRANTED THE ADDITIONAL POWER TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF THOSE CONFIDENCES WHEN IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST.
502	BACKGROUND: THE MAIN ISSUE FOR ADVANCING ANY HEALTH SYSTEM IS HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH (HRH); ALTHOUGH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HRH SHORTAGE AND PERFORMANCE HAVE ACCELERATED OVER RECENT YEARS, HRH IS STILL A PROBLEM FOR DELIVERING QUALITY SERVICES. ADDRESSING KEY GOVERNANCE ISSUES IS ESSENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING CAPABLE HEALTH WORKFORCE, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HRH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A QUALITATIVE STUDY, UNDERTAKEN IN 2017. DATA PROCESSING INCLUDED 14 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH THE EXPERTS OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN MEDICAL UNIVERSITIES AND THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT USING PURPOSEFUL SAMPLING METHOD AND CONTINUED UNTIL REACHING DATA SATURATION. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING SUBJECT ANALYSIS METHOD. RESULTS: THIS STUDY ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMAN RESOURCE GOVERNANCE IN TEN PRINCIPLES INCLUDES STRATEGIC VISION, PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS ORIENTATION, RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS, EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION, AND ETHICS. THE RESULT SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH MOHME TRIES TO REDUCE INSUFFICIENT AND UNBALANCE'S HUMAN RESOURCES AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY BUILDING IN HUMAN RESOURCE PLANNING, THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AMONG POLICY-MAKERS. CONCLUSIONS: STRENGTHENING HUMAN RESOURCE GOVERNANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AMONG THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE HEALTH NATIONAL STRATEGY AND GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE, AND ALL KEY FACTORS IN GOVERNMENT, CIVIL SOCIETY, ACADEMIA, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN HUMAN RESOURCE POLICY-MAKING AND THEIR PARTICIPATIONS SHOULD BE ACCEPTED AS A CULTURE.
503	THE THIRD PLENARY SESSION OF THE 18TH CPC CENTRAL COMMITTEE SET THE "MODERNIZATION OF THE STATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND GOVERNING CAPACITY" AS THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF "COMPREHENSIVE DEEPENING REFORM," WHICH HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL ASPECT OF THE "NEW NORMAL" IN XI JINPING'S ERA. SINCE THEN, THE RESEARCH ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE STATE GOVERNANCE MODEL, STATE GOVERNANCE CAPACITY, AND SOCIAL GOVERNANCE HAS BECOME POPULAR. BY DEFINING THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE AND INVESTIGATING SOCIAL GOVERNANCE MODEL IN CHINA, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION RESTRICTING THE TRANSITION OF THE SOCIAL GOVERNANCE MODEL IN CHINA, EXPOUNDS THE CONNOTATION AND DEVELOPMENT GOAL OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE ALONGSIDE THE STATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM MODERNIZATION, AND ARGUES THAT THE NEW DEVELOPMENT TREND OF "SOCIAL GOVERNANCE" IS TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO THE SELF-GOVERNING MODEL BASED ON DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, AND PLURALISTIC COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO EXERCISE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL OVER THE SOCIETY, NOR TO REPLACE SOCIETAL ACTIONS OR TO TAKE ON EVERYTHING BY ITSELF, RATHER IT IS TO STEER, STANDARDIZE, SUPPORT, AND SERVE THE SOCIAL SELF-GOVERNANCE BY EXERCISING LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS, DEMOCRATIC CONSULTATION, AND SOCIAL POLICIES. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER DEEPENING POLITICAL RESTRUCTURING AND ACHIEVING THE TRANSFORMATION OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS IS THE NECESSARY CONDITION TO FOSTER AND PROMOTE SOCIAL GOVERNANCE CAPACITY AND TO ACHIEVE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE GOVERNANCE MODEL.
504	THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO - A COUNTRY THE SIZE OF WESTERN EUROPE - HAS SUFFERED FROM YEARS OF KLEPTOCRACY, WARFARE AND CIVIL STRIFE. AS A RESULT, DEVELOPMENT HAS SUFFERED ENORMOUSLY: GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE WEAK, THERE ARE FEW ROADS AND MANY FACILITIES ARE DILAPIDATED. A UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WORKING WITH TWELVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROVIDES A USEFUL EXAMPLE OF THE APPLICABILITY (OR LACK THEREOF) OF BEST PRACTICE IN LOCAL PLANNING, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT, AND HOW SOURCES OF BEST PRACTICE POTENTIALLY APPLICABLE TO THE PROJECT WERE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED. THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT REPLICABLE WITHIN THE LOCAL CONTEXT AND THEREFORE PROVIDING A SUSTAINABLE MODEL. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE PRACTICES FINALLY ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED - PREPARING ACTION PLANS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT, INTRODUCING IMPROVED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITH CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND INTRODUCING PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING AND CITIZEN REPORT CARDS. THE ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADDITIVE NATURE OF 'BEST PRACTICE' AND THE PRAGMATIC METHODOLOGY ADOPTED, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY REDUCTIVE - REDUCING, THAT IS, PRACTICES TO THE BARE MINIMUM TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED RESULT. THIS APPROACH CANNOT BE PRESENTED AS BEST PRACTICE, BUT IT WORKED. WHEN PROCEDURES ARE DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN OBJECTIVES, THEY HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW, AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY, OF THE USERS. WHAT WORKS FOR THIS PARTICULAR CONSTITUENCY MAY FALL FAR SHORT OF BEST PRACTICE, BUT IT MAY NEVERTHELESS BE EFFECTIVE IN ENABLING REAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT.
505	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A RIGOROUS METHOD TO MAP THE LAW ON TO THE FACTS IN THE LEGAL ANALYSIS OF SEXUAL CONSENT USING A SERIES OF MANDATORY QUESTIONS OF LAW DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THE LEGAL ERRORS OFTEN MADE BY DECISION MAKERS WHO ROUTINELY RELY ON PERSONAL BELIEFS ABOUT AND ATTITUDES TOWARD "NORMAL SEXUAL BEHAVIOR'' IN SCREENING AND DECIDING CASES. IN CANADA, SEXUAL CONSENT IS AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT, THE COMMUNICATION BY WORDS OR CONDUCT OF "VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT'' TO A SPECIFIC SEXUAL ACTIVITY, WITH A SPECIFIC PERSON. AS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, HOWEVER, THE SEXUAL ASSAULT LAWS ARE OFTEN NOT ENFORCED. REPORTING IS LOWEST AND NON-ENFORCEMENT HIGHEST IN CASES INVOLVING THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF ASSAILANTS, THOSE WHO ARE NOT STRANGERS BUT INSTEAD PERSONS THE COMPLAINANT KNOWS, OFTEN QUITE WELL-ACQUAINTANCES, SUPERVISORS OR COWORKERS, AND FAMILY MEMBERS. RELIANCE ON POPULAR NARRATIVES ABOUT "SEDUCTION'' AND "STRANGER-DANGER'' LEADS COMPLAINANTS, POLICE, PROSECUTORS, LAWYERS, AND TRIAL JUDGES TO TRUNCATE LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE FACTS AND LEAP TO ERRONEOUS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT CONSENT. WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AND PERVERSE ACQUITTALS, QUESTIONABLE PLEA BARGAINS AND ILL-CONSIDERED DECISIONS NOT TO CHARGE, RESULT. THIS PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO CURTAIL THE IMPACT OF PREJUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND BIASES IN LEGAL REASONING ABOUT VOLUNTARINESS AND AFFIRMATIVE AGREEMENT AND TO PRODUCE DECISIONS THAT ARE LEGALLY SOUND, BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE MATERIAL FACTS. LAW HAS LONG HAD BETTER TOOLS THAN THE AGE-OLD AND POPULAR TALES OF "RAVISHMENT'' AND "SEDUCTION.'' THOSE TOOLS CAN AND SHOULD BE USED.
506	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE FINDINGS OF AN EXTENSIVE MULTI-METHOD EMPIRICAL STUDY THAT EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPORARY LEGISLATION, BETTER REGULATION, AND EXPERIMENTALIST GOVERNANCE. TEMPORARY (OR SUNSET) LEGISLATION - STATUTORY PROVISIONS ENACTED FOR A LIMITED TIME AND SET TO EXPIRE UNLESS THEIR VALIDITY IS EXTENDED - IS OFTEN HAILED AS A KEY TOOL FOR PROMOTING EXPERIMENTAL AND BETTER REGULATION. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPORARY LEGISLATION AND THE BURGEONING THEORETICAL SCHOLARSHIP ON THE SUBJECT, THERE IS STILL A DEARTH OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES ABOUT HOW TEMPORARY LEGISLATION IS USED IN PRACTICE. THE LACK OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CREATES A LACUNA IN AT LEAST THREE AREAS OF THEORETICAL SCHOLARSHIP, CONCERNING TEMPORARY LEGISLATION, BETTER REGULATION, AND EXPERIMENTALIST GOVERNANCE. THIS PAPER IS A FIRST STEP TO FILL THIS GAP.
507	BACKGROUNDPUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES RAISE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT CORRUPTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY; HOWEVER, THESE CONCERNS CAN MANIFEST IN DIFFERENT WAYS ACROSS DIVERSE LOCATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WITH A STRONGER RULE OF LAW MAY EXPERIENCE MORE CORRUPTION IN VACCINE PROCUREMENT, WHEREAS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MAY EXPERIENCE MORE CORRUPTION AT THE POINT OF DISTRIBUTION AND DELIVERY TO END USERS. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON CORRUPTION CONCERNS IN NIGERIA, SPECIFICALLY EXAMINING THE PROCUREMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF COVID-19 VACCINES.METHODSTHIS PAPER UTILIZES A SCOPING REVIEW AND A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH. KEY INFORMANTS (N = 40) INVOLVED IN THE PROCUREMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF COVID-19 VACCINES ACROSS TWO STATES IN NIGERIA WERE INTERVIEWED. FINDINGS FROM THE SCOPING REVIEW WERE SUMMARIZED, AND COLLECTED DATA WERE INDUCTIVELY CODED AND ANALYSED IN THEMES, REVEALING CLEAR EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTATION IRREGULARITIES AND CORRUPTION IN THE COUNTRY'S COVID-19 VACCINATION PROCESSES.RESULTSVACCINATION PROGRAMME BUDGETING PROCESSES WERE UNCLEAR, AND PAYMENT IRREGULARITIES WERE FREQUENTLY OBSERVED, RESULTING IN VACCINATORS SOLICITING INFORMAL PAYMENTS WHILE IN THE FIELD. RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT OF VACCINATION PERSONNEL WAS OPAQUE, WHILE TARGET VACCINATION RATES INCENTIVIZED DATA FALSIFICATION DURING PERIODS OF VACCINE HESITANCY. ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS, SUCH AS HEALTH WORKER SUPERVISION, VACCINATION DATA REVIEW, AND ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY DONORS WERE IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING CORRUPTION AMONG FRONTLINE WORKERS.CONCLUSIONSFUTURE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SHOULD BE EVIDENCE-DRIVEN BASED ON FINDINGS FROM THIS RESEARCH. PERSONNEL RECRUITMENT, CONTRACTING, BUDGETING, AND REMUNERATION SHOULD FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
508	IN 2015 EUROPE'S REFUGEE PROTECTION CRISIS TRIGGERED THE EFFECTIVE COLLAPSE OF THE WORLD'S MOST COMPLEX REGIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASYLUM. A DEVELOPMENT BOTH UNEXPECTED AND UNEXPLAINED BY THE HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF EUROPEAN ASYLUM LAW THAT TENDS TO DOMINATE THE SCHOLARLY FIELD. THE ABANDONMENT AMONG MEMBER STATES OF CORE OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND EU LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF SOLIDARITY AND GOOD FAITH IS CENTRAL TO THIS CRISIS. THIS DYNAMIC HAS BEEN IN THE MAKING SINCE THE ACCESSION PROCESS WHEN EU MEMBERSHIP WAS OFFERED IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSPOSING INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE EU ASYLUM ACQUIS, COLLECTIVIZING EXTERNAL BORDER CONTROL AND SHIFTING REFUGEE 'RESPONSIBILITY' TO NEW MEMBER STATES WITH MINIMAL STANDARDS FOR REFUGEE PROTECTION AND WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. YET, THE CRITICAL FEATURE OF THIS ASYLUM CRISIS IS ITS DEVELOPMENT INTO A EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS, IMPACTING FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, SINCERE CO-OPERATION, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. A HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF LAW OFFERS ONLY A PARTIAL EXPLANATION OF THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN REFUGEE PROTECTION AND EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE. A TURN TO THE METHODOLOGICAL DEBATES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW URGES THE REPOSITIONING OF THE LENS OF REFUGEE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, OFFERING INSIGHTS INTO THE EVOLUTION TOWARDS CRISIS BY LOOKING AT LAW FROM BELOW AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF LAW IN HISTORY, SUBREGIONAL LAW-MAKING, AND SHIFTING POWER CONSTELLATIONS. THIS PROCESS SUGGESTS THAT REFUGEE LAW SCHOLARSHIP COULD BENEFIT FROM WIDENING ITS METHODOLOGICAL CANON BY VISITING ITS PARENT FIELD OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW.
509	MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE DESCRIBES A GLOBAL SYSTEM THAT ENROLLS SOME STATE FUNCTIONS TO PERFORM GLOBAL SOLUTIONS FOR GLOBAL PROBLEMS. MULTILEVEL-GOVERNANCE AND MULTILEVEL ADMINISTRATION HAS LEGALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS ON THEIR OWN, ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE MULTILEVEL STRUCTURES WITH NON-STATE PLAYGROUND OF TRANS-REGULATORY NATURE AT THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL OF COOPERATION WHICH MEANS ADDITIONAL SHADES TO THE COLOURFUL PALETTE. THE PROCEDURE AND THE STRUCTURE CONCERNING THE CREATION AND THE EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVE BANKING SUPERVISION STANDARDS IN EUROPE IS UNIQUE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM IS ALSO UNIQUE, AND AS BASEL RULES ARE PRODUCED IN A TRANS-REGULATORY NETWORK, THE COLLABORATION OF THE TWO SUI GENERIS SYSTEMS REQUIRES THERE THINKING OF THE CLASSICAL LEGAL ORDER FEATURES. RULE OF LAW WHICH IS THE BASIS OF CLASSICAL INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN THE VIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF STATES IS CHALLENGED BY THE NEWLY EMERGED SOLUTIONS. NECESSITY AND PROPORTIONALITY ARE PUT ON A SCALE WITH CLASSICAL VALUES AND REQUIREMENTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS SEEM TO PUT IT ON THE SIDE OF THE NEW TYPE OF COLLABORATION. THE NORMATIVE BACKGROUND OF SUCH STRUCTURE IS STILL IMMATURE. THE MULTILEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL SUPERVISION INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE BASEL COMMITTEE FOR BANKING SUPERVISION AT SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL OR SPEAKING IN A WIDER CONTEXT: THE FRAMEWORK FOR MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE WITH NON-STATE ACTORS AT SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL, IS THEREFORE AN EXAMPLE FOR GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF INFANT STATUS.
510	THE DEPARTMENT OF CHOCO IS ONE OF THE MOST BIODIVERSE IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST AFFECTED BY THE COLOMBIAN ARMED CONFLICT, SINCE IT PRESENTS IN ONE OF ITS SUB REGIONAL CONSTANT, MASSIVE AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS HUMANS WHO HAVE MARKED THE MACONDIANA REALITY OF THIS BEAUTIFUL AND RICH DEPARTMENT, FOR CASES SUCH AS THE MASSACRE OF MAY2, 2002 IN BOJAYA, WHERE THERE WERE A LARGE NUMBER OF VICTIMS FROM THE PERSON COMPONENT, SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENT, THE LAST BECAUSE THE RIVER, THE FOREST AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THIS DIVERSITY SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS SUCH AS: SOIL, AIR, AND WATER POLLUTION; AND CONSEQUENT DEFORESTATION AND DEVASTATION CAUSED BY THE CHEMICAL COMPONENTS USED BY ARMED GROUPS OUTSIDE THE LAW TO COMBAT THEIR ENEMIES. IT IS INTENDED TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT VISIBLE AS A VICTIM OF IT AND THE FACTORS THAT ALLOW US TO GIVE IT THIS CONNOTATION. THE HERMENEUTICAL METHOD BASED ON THE REVISION OF DOCTRINE, JURISPRUDENCE AND NORMS THAT RECOGNIZE THE ENVIRONMENT AS A RIGHT WAS USED. IT IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BY THE ENTIRE LEGALLY ORGANIZED COMMUNITY CALLED THE COLOMBIAN STATE, INCURRED IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERT THAT THE ENVIRONMENT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS AN AUTONOMOUS HUMAN RIGHT THAT IS NECESSARY FOR LIFE, DEVELOPMENT OF EACH OF THE RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES ENJOYED BY THE ASSOCIATES OF THE RULE OF LAW TODAY CONVENTIONALIZED.
511	THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND THE FRASER INSTITUTE MEASURE ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN NATIONS USING INDICES WITH TEN AND FIVE INDICATORS RESPECTIVELY. EIGHT OF THE HERITAGE INDICATORS AND FOUR OF THE FRASER-INDICATORS ARE ABOUT SPECIFIC TYPES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, LIKE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY, AND THE PROVISION OF SOUND MONEY. MORE OF THESE IS CONSIDERED TO DENOTE MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM. BOTH INDICES ALSO INVOLVE INDICATORS OF 'BIG GOVERNMENT', OR LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. MORE OF THAT IS SEEN TO DENOTE LESS ECONOMIC FREEDOM. YET, LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING, CONSUMPTION, AND TRANSFERS AND SUBSIDIES APPEAR TO CORRELATE POSITIVELY WITH THE OTHER INDICATORS RELATED TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, WHILE THIS CORRELATION IS CLOSE TO ZERO FOR THE LEVEL OF TAXATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP. USING GOVERNMENT SPENDING, CONSUMPTION TRANSFERS AND SUBSIDIES AS POSITIVE INDICATORS IS NO ALTERNATIVE, BECAUSE THESE LEVELS STAND FOR VERY DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES, LIBERAL OR LESS LIBERAL. THIS MEANS THAT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES CAN BETTER BE LEFT OUT AS NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE INDICATORS. THUS SHORTENED VARIANTS OF THE INDICES CREATE A BETTER CONVERGENT VALIDITY IN THE MEASUREMENT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND CREATE HIGHER CORRELATIONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF FREEDOM, AND BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS. THE HIGHER CORRELATIONS INDICATE A BETTER PREDICTIVE VALIDITY, SINCE THEY ARE PREDICTABLE IN VIEW OF THE FINDINGS OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN TYPES OF FREEDOM, AND BETWEEN FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS.
512	THE CONCERN WITH STABILISING THE POLITICAL AND AVOIDING THE EXCESSIVE DEPLOYMENTS OF COERCIVE FORCE BY TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL IMAGINATIONS IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL LIBERALISMAND LIBERAL POLITICAL THEORY. IT IS RARELY ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL THEOLOGY AND CONCEPTIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT ARE BASED ON POLITICAL THEOLOGY. THE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ITALIAN PHILOSOPHER GIORGIO AGAMBEN TO CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY IS THE OPPORTUNITY IT OFFERS TO CONTEMPLATE THE STABILISATION OF THE POLITICAL IN TERMS OF POLITICAL THEOLOGY AND NOT IN TERMS OF TYPICAL RULE OF LAW ARGUMENTS THAT ONE WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH POLITICAL LIBERALISM. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO TRACE AND QUESTION SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL THOUGHTS ON THE BASIS OF WHICH AGAMBEN PUTS FORWARD THE IDEA OF THE CALLED EXISTENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY. IT DOES SO IN ORDER TO PUT FORWARD, IN RESPONSE, AN ARGUMENT FOR A LITERARY COMMUNITY THAT HAS MUCH IN COMMON WITH AGAMBEN'S CONCEPTION OF THE CHRISTIAN EKKLESIA, BUT ULTIMATELY ALSO DIFFERS FROMIT IN CERTAIN IMPORTANT RESPECTS. THE ARGUMENT FOR A LITERARY COMMUNITY THAT IS DEVELOPED ULTIMATELY HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH NANCY'S CONCEPTION OF AN " INOPERATIVE COMMUNITY". THE ARTICLE ALSO OFFERS A CLOSE SCRUTINY OF AGAMBEN'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORK OF CARL SCHMITT. THIS SCRUTINY OF AGAMBEN'S ENGAGEMENT WITH SCHMITT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE ARGUMENT THAT THE ARTICLE FORWARDS, CONSIDERING THE WAY IN WHICH SCHMITT'S WORK IS WITH GOOD REASON HISTORICALLY LINKED TO EXACTLY THE KIND OF POLITICAL THEOLOGY THAT DESTABILISES RATHER THAN STABILISES THE POLITICAL.
513	THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IS MARKED BY THE RISE OF NEW FORMS OF AUTHORITARIANISM, MANY OF WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE 'PARADOX OF RESTRAINT', IN WHICH REFORMS COMPLIANT WITH THE RULE OF LAW ARE USED TO UNSHACKLE THE RULER'S ARBITRARY POWER. DESPITE A PROLIFERATION OF SCHOLARLY STUDIES ON THIS TOPIC, WE STILL HAVE LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NATIONAL-LEVEL AUTHORITARIAN POWER REACHES ORDINARY CITIZENS IN THESE CONTEXTS. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE PERFORMANCE OF MILITARIZED MASCULINITIES AS AN UNDERSTUDIED MECHANISM THAT DOES SO. IT OFFERS TWO MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS: FIRST, IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW PERFORMANCES OF MILITARIZED MASCULINITIES ENACT THE PARADOX OF RESTRAINT THROUGH GENDERED IDIOMS, THEREBY MAGNIFYING THE AMBIGUITIES OF MODERN AUTHORITARIANISM AND DIFFUSING THEM AT A LOCAL LEVEL. SECOND, IT RECASTS THE CONCEPTUAL UTILITY OF MILITARIZED MASCULINITIES, SHOWING THAT THE CONCEPT'S INHERENT TENSIONS BETWEEN ORDERED DISCIPLINE AND UNACCOUNTABLE VIOLENCE PRODUCE AND PROJECT AUTHORITARIAN POWER, GIVING MILITARIZED MASCULINITIES SPECIAL POTENCY AS A MODE OF SOCIAL DISCIPLINE IN THESE CONTEXTS. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON FEMINIST INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, EMPLOYING GROUNDED ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH TO ILLUSTRATE HOW NATIONAL-LEVEL POWER CIRCULATES LOCALLY. TO DO SO, IT FIRST ILLUSTRATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARADOX OF RESTRAINT AND MILITARIZED MASCULINITIES USING THE CASES OF PUTIN'S RUSSIA AND DUTERTE'S PHILIPPINES. IT THEN TURNS TO AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY OF A LOCAL DISPUTE BETWEEN SOLDIERS AND CIVILIANS IN MUSEVENI'S UGANDA TO TRACE HOW GENDERED LOCAL ENCOUNTERS FACILITATE THE TRANSMISSION OF NATIONAL-LEVEL AUTHORITARIAN POWER INTO THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE.
514	FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS SOCIAL WORKERS AND CIVIL SERVANTS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM. BECAUSE OF THEIR DIRECT CONTACT WITH SOCIETY, FIRSTLINERS ARE TASKED WITH DETECTING INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY THREATEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. PRELIMINARY SCREENING TAKES PLACE DURING THE PRE-CRIME PHASE. HOWEVER, WITHOUT CLEAR EVIDENCE OR CONCRETE INDICATORS OF UNLAWFUL ACTION OR PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, IT IS CHALLENGING TO DETERMINE WHEN SOMEONE POSES A THREAT. THERE ARE NO SET PATTERNS THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY COGNITIVE RADICALIZATION PROCESSES THAT WILL RESULT IN VIOLENT EXTREMISM. FURTHERMORE, PREVENTION TARGETS IDEAS AND IDEOLOGIES WITH NO CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING TERRORISM-RISK. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW CIVIL SERVANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC ORDER, SECURITY AND SAFETY DEAL WITH THEIR MANDATE TO ENGAGE IN EARLY DETECTION, AND DISCUSSES THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT ACCOMPANY THIS PRACTICE. BASED ON OPEN-INTERVIEWS WITH FIFTEEN LOCAL SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IN THE NETHERLANDS, WE FOCUS HERE ON THE RISK ASSESSMENTS MADE BY THESE PROFESSIONALS. TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PERFORMANCE, WE USED THE FOLLOWING TWO RESEARCH QUESTIONS: FIRST, WHAT CRITERIA DO LOCAL SECURITY PROFESSIONALS USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE FORMS A POTENTIAL RISK? SECOND, HOW DO LOCAL SECURITY PROFESSIONALS SUBSTANTIATE THEIR ASSESSMENTS OF THE RADICALIZATION PROCESSES THAT WILL DEVELOP INTO VIOLENT EXTREMISM? WE CONCLUDE THAT SUCH INITIAL RISK WEIGHTINGS RELY STRONGLY ON 'GUT FEELINGS' OR INTUITION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS SUBJECTIVITY MAY LEAD TO PREJUDICE AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE ARBITRARINESS IN RELATION TO PRELIMINARY RISK ASSESSMENT OF PARTICULAR YOUTH.
515	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY MANKIND WAS CONFRONTED WITH SUCH GLOBAL CHALLENGES IN VARIOUS SPHERES OF LIFE AS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, STARVATION AND IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD POPULATION, DEGRADATION OF MORALITY, INCREASING REGIONAL AND INTERETHNIC CONFLICTS, TERRORISM AND OTHERS. THE IDEA OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS THE ANSWER TO THESE CHALLENGES TODAY. LEGAL CULTURE IS ONE OF THE CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINIAN SOCIETY. IT ALLOWS TO RETHINK THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF STATE AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS FOR ENSURING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT BOTH AT THE ORDINARY AND SCIENTIFIC LEVEL. THIS ROLE IS REVEALED BY THE TASKS PERFORMED BY THE LEGAL CULTURE. THE FORMATION OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULATION, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE VALUES AND NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS, THE INVOLVEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL VALUES, AND LEGAL SUPPORT FOR ALL ACTIVITIES AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS DEFINED IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT OF THE UN SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT "TRANSFORMING OUR WORLD: THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT" ARE AMONG THEM. CARRYING OUT LEGAL SOCIALIZATION OF VARIOUS SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC LIFE, DEVELOPING AN APPROPRIATE LEGAL POSITION FOR THEM WILL ALLOW ACHIEVING SOCIAL JUSTICE, BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS OF INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT, ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW, ERADICATING CORRUPTION AND RESTORING CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE AND ITS INSTITUTIONS, STRENGTHENING SOCIAL COHESION, ENSURING THE INTERACTION OF STATE BODIES WITH THE PUBLIC AND SELF-ORGANIZING ACTIVITIES OF CITIZENS.
516	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYSE NORMATIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION IN THE UK BETWEEN 1995 AND 2014 AGAINST THE BENCHMARK OF ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) REGULATORY PRINCIPLES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - METHODOLOGICALLY, THE AUTHORS CONDUCT AN EMPIRICAL, LONGITUDINAL DATA SET ANALYSIS OF THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF UK NORMATIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2014. WE PROVIDE A QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION OF THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT LINKS THE TYPE OF UK REGULATORY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DEVELOPMENT TO FINANCIAL MARKET GROWTH THEREBY ADOPTING A MIXED APPROACH BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FIND THAT COMPARED TO THE OECD MODEL OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, THE UK MODEL IS LESS RIGID FOLLOWING A MORE SELF-REGULATORY APPROACH BASED UPON A "COMPLY OR EXPLAIN" PARADIGM. THUS IT IS SCORED BELOW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS THAT FOLLOW A COMPULSORY IMPLEMENTATION MODEL. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH SUCH "LOW" TILT TOWARDS FORMAL SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY NORMS, THE UK HAS THE BEST PERFORMING FINANCIAL MARKET. AS A QUASI-EMPIRICAL STUDY, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL HISTORICAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS FOR THIS, WHICH TOGETHER WITH A ROBUST RULE OF LAW IN THE UK CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PERFORMANCE - AND THE LAW ESPECIALLY THE TYPE OR TILT IS LESS RELEVANT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND EMPIRICAL, LONGITUDINAL DATA SET ANALYSIS WITH QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS THAT LINKS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EVOLUTION.
517	THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE WAY IN WHICH MODERN INSTITUTIONS EMERGED IN ONE REGION OF BRITISH-RULED INDIATHE GODAVARI DELTA OF COASTAL ANDHRADURING THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY. REJECTING RECENTLY POPULAR CULTURAL THEORIES AND THE VAGUE LANGUAGE OF MULTIPLE MODERNITIES', IT SUGGESTS THAT MODERNITY CAN BE DEFINED AS THE PRACTICAL EFFORT TO GOVERN SUBJECTS PERCEIVED AS STRANGERS WITH ABSTRACT AND GENERAL CATEGORIES. BUT, ARGUING THAT OUR CONCEPTION OF MODERNITY NEEDS TO BE LIMITED, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT MODERN INSTITUTIONS ALWAYS RELY ON NON-MODERN WAYS OF LIFE: THE RULE OF LAW DEPENDS ON IDEAS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL HONOUR; BUREAUCRACY; ON FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND AFFECTIVE EXPRESSIONS OF LOYALTY; AND RATIONAL INTERESTS THAT ARE COORDINATED BY ARCHAIC IDIOMS OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. THE PECULIARITY OF THE HISTORY OF MODERNITY IN IMPERIAL INDIA WAS MARKED NOT BY THE LIMITED OR PARTIAL IMPOSITION OF MODERN PRACTICES, BUT BY THE BRITISH REGIME'S RELUCTANCE TO ACCEPT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE VERY NON-MODERN FORMS OF POWER IT RELIED ON. TRACING THIS PROCESS IN THE GODAVARI DELTA, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW A REGIME WITH LIMITED LOCAL RESOURCES ASSERTED THE MONOPOLISTIC AUTHORITY OF ITS STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT, BUT IN DOING SO, CORRODED ITS OWN CAPACITY TO EXERCISE POWER. LOCAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAD COORDINATED LOCAL PRODUCTIVE RESOURCES WERE UNDERMINED, BUT ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP WERE UNABLE TO EMERGE. THE CONSEQUENCE WAS FAMINE IN THE 1830S, AND IN THE 1840S AN EFFORT TO REFOUND THE IMPERIAL REGIME BY IMPOSING BRITISH POWER ON THE REGION'S NATURAL RESOURCES.
518	CONFLICTING REGULATORY DEMANDS ON HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (HEIS) CONTRIBUTE TO AN ENVIRONMENT OF INCREASING LEGAL RISK FOR HEIS. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASING COST OF NON-COMPLIANCE JEOPARDIZES INSTITUTIONAL VIABILITY AS HEIS STRUGGLE TO ADJUST TO THE PRESSURE CREATED BY THESE LEGALLY-MANDATED CHANGES. THE LEGAL RISK TO HEIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BREAKDOWN THAT EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCE BETWEEN THEIR AWARENESS OF POLICIES AND THEIR FOLLOW THROUGH IN CARRYING OUT THOSE LEGAL ACTIONS. HEIS WOULD BENEFIT FROM IMPLEMENTING LEGALLYMANDATED CHANGE IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZES COMPLIANCE AND THEREFORE MINIMIZES RISKS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS (LEGAL RULE, LEGAL PROCEDURE AND LEGAL AGENTS) OF A NEW MODEL, SYNCHING THE LAW, THAT SYNCHRONIZES THE LAW WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS ALLOWING THE ORGANIZATION TO UNDERSTAND ITSELF IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL RULE AND ADAPT SUCCESSFULLY TO THE LEGAL MANDATE. WHILE THIS PAPER IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON MAKING INSTITUTIONAL LEGAL CHANGE, THE STUDY USED DIVERSE HIRING PRACTICES OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION HIRING MANAGERS TO REVEAL THE ROLE OF LEGAL AGENT SELF-IDENTITY IN THE LEGAL CHANGE DECISIONMAKING PROCESS. THIS STUDY REINFORCES THE NEED FOR GUIDANCE IN MAKING LEGALLY-MANDATED CHANGES THAT EMBED EFFECTIVELY WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS USING PRINCIPLES FROM ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AND THERAPEUTIC PARADIGMS. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL DECISION MAKING CANNOT SOLELY BE AFFECTED BY AN AWARENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL PROCEDURES. IN FACT, SETTING THE LAW AS A PRIORITY IS INSUFFICIENT TO MOTIVATE COMPLIANCE TO THE LAW BY THOSE WHO MUST CARRY OUT THESE LEGAL RULES.
519	INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SOMETIMES SUFFER FROM ACUTE AGENCY PROBLEMS. THREE EXOGENOUS METHODS OF ADDRESSING THOSE PROBLEMS ARE CONSIDERED: ECONOMIC INCENTIVES, POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE FIRST IS UNDESIRABLE AND THE SECOND INEVITABLY WEAK. THERE IS THEREFORE AN ARGUMENT FOR HEIGHTENED LEGAL SCRUTINY OF THEIR ACTIONS. YET INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AN UNENVIABLE TRACK RECORD OF ACTING WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF RULE OF LAW, AND THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN UNSIGHTLY CATALOGUE OF THEIR LEGAL ABERRATIONS. MOREOVER, THE INTERNAL LEGAL MECHANISMS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CREATED OSTENSIBLY TO HOLD THEMSELVES TO ACCOUNT PROVE WANTING AT BEST. THERE MAY ALSO BE STRUCTURAL REASONS WHY INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONDUCT AN ADEQUATE REVIEW OF THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ROUTINELY TAKE. THIS MAKES THOSE ORGANIZATIONS' ASSERTIONS OF BLANKET LEGAL IMMUNITY FROM JURISDICTION OF DOMESTIC COURTS APPEAR INCREASINGLY INEXPLICABLE, AS IT REMOVES ALL POSSIBILITY OF LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE SUPPOSED RATIONALES FOR LEGAL IMMUNITIES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE REVIEWED AND PROVED WANTING. THE CONCLUSION DRAWN IS THAT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO RADICALLY IMPROVED REGIMES OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT, OR THEIR IMMUNITIES SHOULD BE ABROGATED IN CERTAIN AREAS SO THAT THEY MAY BE RENDERED SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE DOMESTIC COURTS OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE, OR BOTH. MEASURES OF THIS KIND MAY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DECISION-MAKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.
520	THE SCALE AND INTENSITY OF THE APPROPRIATION OF IRAQI OIL REVENUE MAKES THE 2003 INVASION ONE OF THE MOST AUDACIOUS AND SPECTACULAR CRIMES OF THEFT IN MODERN HISTORY. THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF CORPORATE CORRUPTION THAT FOLLOWED THE INVASION CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE COALITION FORCES' CONTEMPT FOR UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ENSHRINED IN THE HAGUE AND GENEVA TREATIES. NEO-LIBERAL SHOCK THERAPY IMPOSED ON IRAQ BY THE ANGLO-AMERICAN GOVERNMENT OF OCCUPATION PROVIDED MOMENTUM TO AN ECONOMIC ORDER WHICH PRIVILEGED THE PRIMACY AND AUTONOMY OF MARKET ACTORS OVER LAWS INTENDED TO ENSHRINE UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS FOR CIVILIAN POPULATIONS IN WAR AND CONFLICT. AS THE US GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED AUDITOR HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ESTABLISHED, AN UNKNOWN PROPORTION OF IRAQI OIL REVENUE HAS DISAPPEARED INTO THE POCKETS OF CONTRACTORS AND FIXERS IN THE FORM OF BRIBERY, OVER-CHARGING, EMBEZZLEMENT, PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION, BID RIGGING AND FALSE CLAIMS. AT LEAST $12 BILLION OF THE REVENUE APPROPRIATED BY THE COALITION REGIME HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY ACCOUNTED FOR. THIS NEO-LIBERAL STRATEGY OF ECONOMIC COLONIZATION WAS FACILITATED BY MAJOR VIOLATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAWS OF CONFLICT AND BY UNILATERALLY GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION TO US PERSONNEL. THE SUSPENSION OF THE NORMAL RULE OF LAW BY THE OCCUPYING POWERS, IN TURN, ENCOURAGED COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY TOLERANCE OF, AND PARTICIPATION IN, THE THEFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS IN IRAQ. STATE-CORPORATE CRIMINALITY IN THE CASE OF OCCUPIED IRAQ MUST THEREFORE BE UNDERSTOOD AS PART OF A WIDER STRATEGY OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DOMINATION.
521	RESEARCH ON CLIENTELISM EMPHASIZES THE USE OF BROKERS TO MOBILIZE VOTERS. TO UTILIZE THESE AGENTS EFFICIENTLY, POLITICIANS MUST LEARN ABOUT BROKERS' RELATIVE ABILITIES AND ALLOCATE SCARCE RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY. DRAWING UPON A HAND-CODED DATASET BASED ON THE ARCHIVES OF GUSTAVO CAPANEMA, A POWERFUL MID-TWENTIETH-CENTURY CONGRESSMAN FROM MINAS GERAIS, BRAZIL, THIS PAPER OFFERS THE FIRST DIRECT EVIDENCE OF SUCH LEARNING DYNAMICS. THE ANALYSIS CONCENTRATES ON BRAZIL'S PRE-SECRET BALLOT ERA, A TIME WHEN MEASURING BROKER PERFORMANCE WAS PARTICULARLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. CONSISTENT WITH THEORIES OF POLITICAL LEARNING, THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT RESOURCE FLOWS TO LOCAL MACHINES WERE CONTINGENT ON THE DEVIATION BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED VOTES RECEIVED IN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS. MOREOVER, GIVEN POLITICIANS' ABILITY TO DISCERN MOBILIZATION CAPACITY, PAYMENTS TO BROKERS WERE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN BRINGING OUT THE VOTE.
522	RELEVANT INITIATIVES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) AIMED AT STRENGTHENING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION. HOWEVER, CUMULATIVE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS FOR IMPLEMENTING RIGOROUS PREVENTION SCIENCE IN THESE CONTEXTS, AS DEFINED BY GUIDELINES FROM HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES (HICS). SPECIFICALLY, DISSEMINATING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION IN LMICS CAN BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY, LIMITED HEALTH COVERAGE, INSECURITY, LIMITED RULE OF LAW, AND SCARCITY OF SPECIALIZED PROFESSIONALS. THIS MANUSCRIPT OFFERS A CONTRIBUTION FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION IN LMICS. SPECIFICALLY, FOUR CASE STUDIES ARE PRESENTED ILLUSTRATING THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF CONTRASTING PREVENTION INITIATIVES IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MEXICO, PANAMA, AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE INITIATIVES SHARE THE COMMON GOAL OF STRENGTHENING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION IN LMICS THROUGH THE DISSEMINATION OF EFFICACIOUS PARENTING PROGRAMS, AIMED AT REDUCING CHILD MALTREATMENT AND IMPROVING PARENTAL AND CHILD MENTAL HEALTH. TOGETHER, THESE INITIATIVES ILLUSTRATE THE FOLLOWING: (A) THE RELEVANCE OF ADOPTING A DEFINITION OF CULTURE OF PREVENTION CHARACTERIZED BY NATIONAL COMMITMENTS WITH EXPECTED SHARED CONTRIBUTIONS BY GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY, (B) THE NEED TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF CONTEXT WHEN PROMOTING PREVENTION INITIATIVES IN LMICS, (C) THE ITERATIVE, NON-LINEAR, AND MULTI-FACETED NATURE OF PROMOTING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION IN LMICS, AND (D) THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMITTING TO CULTURAL COMPETENCE AND SHARED LEADERSHIP WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF PREVENTION SCIENCE IN LMICS. IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPANDING A CULTURE OF PREVENTION IN LMICS ARE DISCUSSED.
523	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE BARRIER CLAUSE APPROVED IN CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 97/2017, WHICH RESTRICTS THE MINORITY POLITICAL PARTIES'S ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC SHARE FUNDING AND TO THE FREE POLITICAL ADVERTISING TIME ON RADIO AND TELEVISION, DUE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF VOTES IN THE PROPORTIONAL ELECTIONS TO THE LOWER HOUSE, OR ALTERNATIVELY, FAILURE TO ELECT A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN FEDERAL REPRESENTATIVES DISTRIBUTED IN ONE THIRD OF THE STATES. THIS ARTICLE ALSO INVESTIGATES THE HISTORICAL INCIDENCE OF THE ELECTORAL PERFOMANCE CLAUSE IN BRAZIL, USING CLASSICAL BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW ON POLITICAL PARTIES, DEMOCRACY AND ELECTORAL LAW, IN ORDER TO DISCUSS ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY. IN SEQUENCE, THIS ESSAY PROJECTS THE IMPACT OF THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, ON THE BASIS OF STATISTICAL DATA PROVIDED BY THE SUPERIOR ELECTORAL COURT RELATING TO THE GENERAL ELECTIONS OF 2014, COMPARED TO THE 2006 ELECTIONS, WHEN COMES TO THE ADI 1.351/DF, WHICH RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE ORIGINAL BARRIER CLAUSE INSERT IN LAW NO. 9.096/95. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 97/2017, IN THE PART THAT AMENDS THE THIRD PARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 17 OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, REPRESENTS A VIOLATION OF BRAZILIAN DEMOCRACY AS FAR AS THIS HAS ELECTED THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, POLITICAL PLURALISM, MULTIPARTY SYSTEM AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. THEREFORE, THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE JEOPARDIZING THE SURVIVAL OF MINORITY PARTIES, PREMISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN FAVOUR OF THE ESTABLISHED POWER.
524	FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOW IS SEEN AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF EXTERNAL FINANCING AND A KEY FACTOR IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEREAS SOUND INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY (IQ) NOT ONLY DIRECTLY ENHANCES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ALSO PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN STRENGTHENING THE FDI-GROWTH NEXUS OF HOST COUNTRIES. THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF FDI INFLOW AND IQ ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FURTHER CONCENTRATED ON THE INSTITUTIONS' ROLE IN FDI-GROWTH NEXUS. WE USED A WIDER DATASET OF 80 COUNTRIES FROM THREE DEVELOPING REGIONS, INCLUDING ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA), AND ESTIMATED A DYNAMIC PANEL MODEL USING THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT. THIS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT WHILE BOTH FDI INFLOWS AND IQ ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN SURGING ECONOMIC GROWTH, FDI-LED ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS HIGHER IN ASIAN AND SSA COUNTRIES. SIMILARLY, THE INTERACTION OF FDI WITH IQ ALSO HAD A LARGER IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF ASIA. NOTABLY, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FDI INFLUENCE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH INCREASED IN ALL THREE REGIONS WHEN THE INTERACTION TERM IQ WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE MODEL. ADDITIONALLY AMONG THE SUB-FACTORS OF IQ, INTERACTION OF FDI WITH POLITICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ALL REGIONS, WHILE RULE OF LAW WAS NEGATIVE, AND REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS SHOWED INSIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES ON FDI-GROWTH NEXUS ONLY IN THE CASE OF SSA. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY ARE ROBUST BECAUSE DIFFERENT MODEL SPECIFICATIONS WERE APPLIED.
525	IN THE WAKE OF THE SNC-LAVALIN SCANDAL, A DEBATE HAS BROKEN OUT ABOUT HOW TO REGULATE THE PROFESSIONAL LEGAL CONDUCT OF CANADIAN JUDGES ONCE THEY RETIRE FROM OFFICE. THE ENTANGLEMENT OF FOUR FORMER SUPREME COURT OF CANADA JUSTICES IN THE VIOLATION OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST ACT AND THE ATTEMPTED CIRCUMVENTION OF PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE BY JUSTIN TRUDEAUS' PRIME MINISTERS' OFFICE HAS LED SOME TO ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF A COMPLETE PROHIBITION ON ALL PROFESSIONAL LEGAL ACTIVITIES BY FORMER JUDGES. OTHERS HAVE DEFENDED THE LACK OF SUCH RESTRICTIONS, CITING THE CONTRIBUTION FORMER JUDGES MAKE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST BY PRACTICING LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO ADDRESS HOW THE DEEPER PRINCIPLES OF CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM RELATE TO THE QUESTION OF ALLOWING FORMER JUDGES TO PRACTICE LAW. THEY THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ENGAGED BY THIS QUESTION ARE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEY ARGUE THAT TOGETHER THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT FORMER JUDGES BE PROHIBITED FROM PRACTICING IN MATTERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, BUT ALLOWED TO WORK IN ALL OTHER AREAS OF LAW NOT DIRECTLY IMPLICATING DECISIONS THEY MADE ON THE BENCH. THE AUTHORS' POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FOR THE PROVINCIAL AND TERRITORIAL LAW SOCIETIES TO ENACT PROHIBITIONS ON FORMER JUDGES PRACTICING CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND FOR THE LAW SOCIETIES TO ESTABLISH BROAD EXEMPTIONS FOR FORMER JUDGES TO PRACTICE OTHER TYPES OF LAW IN CASES NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO CASES THEY ADJUDICATED ON THE BENCH.
526	THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDY EMPLOYS A DYNAMIC COMMON CORRELATED MEAN GROUP TECHNIQUE USING DATA FROM A GLOBAL SAMPLE OF 120 COUNTRIES, AMONG WHICH 32 HIGH- AND 88 LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2017 TO EXAMINE THIS LINKAGE. POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE USED AS PROXIES FOR GOVERNANCE QUALITY, WHEREAS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEPTH AND CREDIT TO PRIVATE SECTOR ARE PROXIES OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. REGULATORY QUALITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. MOREOVER, THE DEGREE OF THE IMPACT OF THESE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS RELATIVELY GREATER IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AS COMPARED TO LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. ON THE BASIS OF THESE RESULTS, GOVERNMENTS IN HIGH- AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES MUST IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING POLICIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS: FIRSTLY, THEY SHOULD PROMOTE A BETTER REGULATION QUALITY BY IMPLEMENTING SOUND POLICIES AND REGULATIONS THAT PERMIT AND IMPROVE PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. SECONDLY, THEY SHOULD MAINTAIN A STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ENJOY, BUT NOT EXCESSIVELY, THEIR RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. POLICY MAKERS SHOULD LASTLY MODERATE THEIR COMMITMENT TOWARDS CERTAIN PUBLIC POLICIES, SUCH AS IMPOSITION OF HIGH TAX RATE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
527	FACED WITH COMPLICATED EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CHALLENGES, CHINA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SEE SLUGGISH GROWTH IN 2018. RAPID ACCUMULATION OF HOUSEHOLD DEBTS, EXACERBATION IN INCOME INEQUALITY, TIGHTENED REAL SECTOR LIQUIDITY, ESCALATED TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE US, AND WEAKENED EXTERNAL DEMAND POSE KEY PROBLEMS IN CHINA'S MACROECONOMIC LANDSCAPE. THE STATUS QUO IS EXACERBATED BY SOARING UNCERTAINTY AND WEAKENING CONFIDENCE IN THE FACE OFPERSISTENT RESOURCE MISALLOCATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL DISTORTIONS, WHICH CAST MORE SHADOW ON THE ALREADY DAMPENED CONSUMER SENTIMENT, SLUGGISH PRIVATE INVESTMENT GROWTH, AND FALLEN FOREIGN RESERVES. THIS SUMMARY REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENCY OF DEEPER STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR TACKLING THE VARIOUS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PROBLEMS. BASED ON THE IAR-CMM MODEL, WITH BOTH CYCLICAL AND SECULAR FACTORS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, OUR BASELINE FORECAST OF REAL GDP GROWTH RATE IS 6.4% (6.1% USING MORE RELIABLE INSTEAD OF THE OFFICIAL DATA) IN 2019. ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSES AND POLICY SIMULATIONS ARE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF POSSIBLE DOWNSIDE RISKS AND THE CORRESPONDING POLICY OPTIONS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE ASSUMED GROWTH TARGETS. THESE ANALYSES LEAD US TO CONCLUDE THAT COMPREHENSIVELY DEEPENING REFORM AND OPENING UP, WHICH SHOULD BE BOTH RULE-OF-LAW BASED AND MARKET-ORIENTED, WITH WELL-DESIGNED AND WELL-CONCEIVED STRATEGIES THAT PROPERLY WEIGH SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM BENEFITS AND COSTS, SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE SET AS THE GUIDANCE FOR CHINA'S TRANSFORMATION INTO A PHASE WITH SUSTAINABLE AND HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH.
528	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL VALUE AND SOCIAL PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF STATES AND A METHOD OF FIXING THE PROSPECTS FOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IN PARTICULAR, QUESTIONS ARE RAISED ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT IN AUTOCRATIC STATES AND ITS SOCIAL PERCEPTION. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF RIGHTS AND JUSTICE AND SOCIAL STATE ARE SUBJECTED TO DETAILED ANALYSIS, AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IS ASSESSED EITHER, IN FIRST, AS A PRINCIPLE, AS A SUPREME VALUE OR A NATIONWIDE IDEA OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OR, IN SECOND, AS A CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL NORM. THE AUTHOR DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT DIFFERENTLY FORMULATED CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS DO NOT GIVE RISE TO CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE LAW-CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE OF STATES. IT HAS ALSO BEEN NOTED THAT NOT EVERY STATE THAT REALISTICALLY AND ROUTINELY ENSURES THE RULE OF LAW AND RECOGNIZES THE INHERENT DUTY OF THE STATE TO GUARANTEE UNCONDITIONAL BASIC INCOME AS A GUARANTEE OF A DECENT LIFE FOR CITIZENS, IS DETERMINED ITSELF CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF RIGHTS AND JUSTICE AND SOCIAL STATE IN ITS CONSTITUTION. AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENT THE AUTHOR SEES IN THE STABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND LEGISLATION. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE MUCH MORE LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DESCRIBING THE STATE AS CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF RIGHTS AND JUSTICE AND SOCIAL STATE IN CONSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF PRINCIPLES - ORGANIZATIONAL IDEAS FOR CREATING APPROPRIATE CONDITIONS, AND NOT AS CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS.
529	IN DECEMBER 1998 THE BODY OF THE BURKINABE NOVELIST AND NEWSPAPER EDITOR NORBERT ZONGO WAS FOUND IN HIS BURNED-OUT VEHICLE IN THE VILLAGE OF SAPOUY. HE HAD BECOME A VICTIM OF THE IMPUNITY OF THE DICTATORIAL REGIME OF BURKINA FASO'S PRESIDENT, BLAISE COMPAORE. STEN HAGBERG CONTENDS THAT THE KILLING OF NORBERT ZONGO CHARACTERIZED A CERTAIN POLITICAL CULTURE AND WAS THUS PERCEIVED AS THE STARTING POINT FOR AN ORGANIZED AND WIDELY MOBILIZED SOCIOPOLITICAL STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPUNITY (31). STRIKES AND RIOTS CHARACTERIZED THE STRUGGLE TO BRING JUSTICE FOR ZONGO AND OTHER VICTIMS FOR WHOSE DEATHS THE PERPETRATORS HAD BEEN NEITHER TRIED NOR PUNISHED. IT WAS TIME THAT IMPUNITY CAME TO AN END, IT WAS ARGUED, BEFORE ANY RULE OF LAW COULD BE REAL (HAGBERG 219). WHILE THE CRITICAL FOCUS HAS RESTED PREDOMINANTLY ON THE SOCIOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS OF THIS STRUGGLE, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST IMPUNITY ALSO FOUND EXPRESSION IN ZONGO'S OUTSPOKEN JOURNALISM AND IN HIS FICTIONAL WORK, AS WELL AS THAT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE CRITIQUE OF IMPUNITY IN ZONGO'S LE PARACHUTAGE (1989) AND IN THE LATER BURKINABE NOVELS OF PATRICK ILBOUDO AND LORO MAZONO. I APPROACH THESE BURKINABE NOVELS AS DICTATOR-NOVELS AND ARGUE THAT WHILE A FOCUS ON THE AESTHETIC QUALITIES OF THESE TEXTS IS IMPORTANT, THEY MUST ALSO BE READ AS PART OF THE SUSTAINED FIGHT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTEMPORARY BURKINA FASO.
530	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE DETERMINANTS OF BANK INTEREST RATE SPREAD IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES, WHICH WERE CATEGORIZED INTO MACRO-SPECIFIC, BANK-SPECIFIC AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS USED FIXED EFFECTS ESTIMATIONS TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE DATA WERE DRAWN FROM A POOL OF 20 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS SPANNING 2003-2012. THE COUNTRIES WERE CATEGORIZED INTO LOW-INCOME, LOWER MIDDLE-INCOME AND UPPER MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES BASED ON WORLD BANK INCOME CLASSIFICATIONS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INFLATION HAS A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INTEREST RATE SPREAD, WHILE OPERATING COSTS AND BANK CONCENTRATION HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INTEREST RATE SPREAD. SIMILARLY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE SPREAD. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT INTEREST RATE SPREAD IS DETERMINED BY BOTH BANK-SPECIFIC, MACRO-ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES. THE PAPER ALSO INDICATES THAT THE INCOME STATUS OF A COUNTRY IS IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING THE VARIATIONS IN THE INTEREST RATE SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION. THEREFORE, THE POLICY MAKERS SHOULD DESIGN POLICIES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIABLES IN ORDER TO HELP IN PLANNING BY ALL ECONOMIC AGENTS, INCLUDING BANKS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER USES DATA FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND INTRODUCES INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES IN THE MODEL, WHICH HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE CRITICAL IN THE CONTEXT.
531	THE LAST REPORT ON TURKEY WRITTEN BY PROFESSOR ESIN ORUCU(1) ANALYSED THE 2010 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. THESE REFORMS WERE PERHAPS THE LAST STEP IN TURKEY'S DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME, SOMETIMES WITH DETERMINATION, SOMETIMES WITH HESITANT STEPS, WITH THE AIM OF HARMONIZING ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM WITH EUROPEAN VALUES. EVEN THOUGH ALL POLITICAL PARTIES PROMISED A NEW CONSTITUTION ON THE EVE OF THE 2011 GENERAL PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, THIS ATTEMPT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL. BUT THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS THAT DESTROYED THE HOPES OF DEMOCRATIZATION WERE THE GEZI PARK PROTESTS IN MAY-JUNE 2013, AND THE MAJOR CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE PUBLICIZED ON 17/25 DECEMBER. THE GEZI PARK EVENTS WERE THE SCENE OF DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF THE POLICE FORCE UNDER THE ORDERS OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE CORRUPTION CHARGES LED THE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTROL OVER THE JUDICIARY AND THE SECURITY FORCES IN VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. SUCH VIOLATIONS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THE PROCESS OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT TOOK PLACE IN 10 AUGUST 2014. THESE PRACTICES, BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION, WERE IN VIOLATION NOT ONLY OF THE CONSTITUTION IN FORCE, BUT ALSO OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULINGS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN THE PROCESS, MANY CRITICAL JOURNALISTS AND ACADEMICS LOST THEIR JOBS. THUS, A DRIFT TOWARD AUTHORITARIANISM WAS OBSERVED STARTING WITH THE ELECTIONS OF 2011.
532	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SERVE TO DIFFUSE HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND CREATE JUDICIAL CAPACITY BUILDING IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE HOW THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) AND THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE HAVE INFLUENCED THE REFORM OF DOMESTIC COURTS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA (BIH). WE PLACE THESE REFORMS WITHIN THE BROADER DEBATE OVER RESTRUCTURING THE COMPLEX SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN BIH. SINCE 2005, DOMESTIC COURTS IN BIH HAVE HAD JURISDICTION OVER THE FOLLOWING: (1) CASES WHICH WERE INITIALLY UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DOMESTIC COURTS BUT REMANDED TO THE ICTY AND RECENTLY RETURNED TO BIH. (2) CASES WHICH ORIGINATED AT THE ICTY AND HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE COURT, AND (3) NEW CASES WHICH ORIGINATED AND REMAINED IN THE DOMESTIC COURT SYSTEM. WE FIND THAT WHILE HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE NEW LEGAL CODE, THE DIFFUSION OF THESE HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS HAS BEEN INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF JUDICIAL CAPACITY BUILDING. WHILE SOME COURTS IN THE CAPITAL ENJOY SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES, THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES WILL BE TRIED AT PROVINCIAL COURTS WHICH ARE UNDER-FUNDED AND UNABLE TO PROSECUTE THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES. MOREOVER, THE GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE OF BIH HAS HAD A DECIDEDLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PROSECUTION OF THESE CASES. ULTIMATELY, THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES CONSISTENCY OF APPROACH AND FUNDING TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.
533	COMPETITIVE ATHLETES FACE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ATHLETIC AS WELL AS THE ACADEMIC OF THE STUDENTS. THEREFORE, THIS STATEMENT DESCRIBES THAT HOW ATHLETES COVER THEIR MENTAL STRESS ALONG AGGRESSIVE STRUGGLE OF COLLEGE LIFE. SPORTS BASE STUDENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, AND PROGRESS EFFICIENCY OF THE SPORTS STUDENTS. THE PARTICIPATION OF STUDENTS IN SPORTS IS IMPORTANT, AS IT EXTENDS THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EXPANDS OF OUR SOCIETY FINANCIALLY, ACADEMICALLY, POLITICALLY, AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE IMAGE OF AN ORGANIZATION OR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION, THE STUDENT-ATHLETES IS AS A HIGHLY VISIBLE SUBGROUP OF STUDENTS WHOSE PERFORMANCE AND VISIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT FOR THE INSTITUTION. THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CLASSROOMS, CAN BE SEEN AS A SYSTEM OF STRESS CONSISTING FORCES THAT REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE OVER TIME. THE DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM 242 ATHLETIC STUDENTS. IN THIS PAPER, THE PERCEIVED LEVEL OF LEARNING ANXIETY, PERCEIVED USEFULNESS OF STUDENT'S LEARNING, AND SELF-ENGAGEMENT IN LEARNING COURSE ARE THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. WHEREAS, POSITIVE SPORTS PSYCHOLOGY IS A DEPENDENT VARIABLE. THE RESEARCH MODEL HAD THREE HYPOTHESIS STATEMENTS. THE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE PORTALS. FURTHERMORE, THE DATA WAS ANALYZED ON SMART PLS 3. THE RESULTS AND FINDINGS OF THE DATA INDICATED A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE VARIABLES.
534	CHRISTIAAN WILLEM HENDRIK VAN DER POST (1856-1914) WAS A REMARKABLE WRITER WHOSE WORK ON THE LIFT OF DUTCH PROTESTANT SETTLERS CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF FAITH AND RACE AMONG THE BOERS IN 19TH CENTURY SOUTH AFRICA. UNLIKE THE PREVAILING VALUES OF THE VICTORIAN AGE IN ENGLAND, VAN DER POST'S BOOK ON THE VOORTREKKER EPOCH, PIET UIJS OR THE SUFFERING AND STRUGGLE OF THE VOORTREKKERS IN NATAL DOES NOT IN ANYWAY ENDORSE OR PROMOTE A RACIST OUTLOOK ON COLONIAL SETTLEMENT IN AFRICA, BUT INSTEAD TELLS A STORY OF FAITH, HUMILITY, COURAGE AND THE RULE OF LAW. VAN DER POST WAS A MAN OF MANY TALENTS. HE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE AS A TEACHER, FARMER AND HISTORIAN. IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE ANGLO-BOER WAR HE ESTABLISHED ONE OF THE LARGEST LAW FIRMS IN THE FREE STATE. HE ALWAYS REMAINED A DUTCHMAN, WITH A CALLING IN AFRICA. FOR MANY YEARS HE WAS THE DUTCH CONSUL IN THE ORANGE FREE STATE, BASED IN FAURESMITH, AS WELL AS A MEMBER OF THE "LBLKSRAAD" (PARLIAMENT) OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE FOR THIS DISTRICT AND A COLLABORATOR OF PRESIDENT STEYN. HE ALSO SERVED AS THE "VOLKSRAADS" CHAIRMAN FOR A YEAR. DURING THE BOER WAR HE BECAME COMMANDANT OF THE BOER FORCES IN THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CAPITAL BLOEMFONTEIN. EVEN AFTER NEARLY ALL HIS MEN HAD SURRENDERED, HE CONTINUED TO FIGHT, REASSEMBLED A COMMANDO AND WAS EVENTUALLY CAPTURED IN THE TRANSVAAL. VAN DER POST WAS A MAN OF PRINCIPLE. AFTER THE WAR HE ONLY RETURNED TO THE FREE STATE WHEN HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT PLEDGING HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE BRITISH CROWN. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, DEPARTING FROM HIS BOOK PIET UIJS, THAT VAN DER POSTS AITH WAS DECISIVE FOR HIS OUTLOOK ON LIFE. IN VOORTREKKER LEADER PIET UIJS HE RECOGNISED SIMILAR PRINCIPLES: A REFORMED CONVICTION THAT VIEWED LIFE FROM A THEOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE. GOD WAS THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR TO WHOM ALL MEN OWED OBEDIENCE. HIS LAWS WERE RIGHT AND FOLLOWING HIS GUIDANCE WAS COMMENDABLE, EVEN IF OBEDIENCE DID NOT RESULT IN MATERIAL GAIN OR SOCIAL SUCCESS. HIS CHRONICLE ON PIET UIJS SHOWS THAT FAITH, HUMILITY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS HAVE AN INTRINSIC VALUE THAT CONTINUE TO INSPIRE OTHER PEOPLE AND SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. A TRUE CHRISTIAN LEADER IS CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOD'S WORD. AS FAR AS THESE WERE CONCERNED, FAITH WAS THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR, THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN AS YET (HEBREW 11:1). LIKE THE HEROES OF FAITH IN PAUL'S EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS, IT MAY BE SAID ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS OF VAN DER POSTS STORY THAT "THESE ALL DIED IN FAITH, NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE PROMISES, BUT HAVING SEEN THEM AFAR OFF AND WERE PERSUADED OF THEM, AND EMBRACED THEM, AND CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS ON THE EARTH" (HEBREW 11:13, KJV). VAN DER POST'S INTERPRETATION OF THIS EPISODE OF THE GREAT TREK IS A FAR CRY FROM THE NATIONALISTIC MYTHMAKING OF LATER GENERATIONS (E.G. GUSTAV PRELLER). RACISM DOES NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THIS BOOK, AND UNLIKE HIS ENGLISH VICTORIAN CONTEMPORARIES, VAN DER POST CHERISHES OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF FAITH AND ULTIMATE CIVILISATION FOR THE PAGAN TRIBES OF AFRICA. HIS CHRONICLE OF PIET (NS 'S ENTERPRISE ENDS IN A COMPLETE FAILURE FOR THE LATTER, YET IT WAS NONETHELESS INSPIRATIONAL AS A COMPASS OF FAITH, BROTHERLY LOVE AND AN UNSELFISH COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
535	THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS HISTORICAL METHOD OF INTERPRETATION IN LAW, ITS CAPACITIES AND TYPES. DESPITE THE RECOGNITION OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION BY LEGAL SCIENCE, THERE ARE NO SPECIALIZED WORKS AND THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE CONTENT OF THIS METHOD OF INTERPRETATION. HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION IS CONSIDERED BOTH AS AN INTERPRETATION BASED ON A PREVIOUS RULE OF LAW, AS AN INTERPRETATION CONSIDERING THE CONDITIONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE NORM, AND AS AN INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE PRACTICE OF APPLYING THE INTERPRETED NORM. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AUTHORS' HYPOTHESIS THAT HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION IN LAW IS AN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY THAT INVOLVES CLARIFYING THE CONTENT OF A LEGAL PRESCRIPTION, ACHIEVED BASED ON IDENTIFYING LEGAL AND NON-LEGAL FACTORS THAT BOTH PRECEDE THE CREATION OF THE NORM AND ACCOMPANY ITS ADOPTION. IN ADDITION, THE AUTHORS SET THE TASK TO IDENTIFY THOSE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION, AS WELL AS TO CLASSIFY THE TYPES OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION. THE ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION IS MADE USING SCIENTIFIC METHODS: INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION, FORMAL LEGAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL SYNCHRONOUS AND DIACHRONIC METHODS. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION CONSIDERS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND LEGAL FACTORS. LEGAL FACTORS INCLUDE THE RULES OF LAW THAT PRECEDED THE INTERPRETED NORM, REPEALED ACTS, OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS OF LAW- MAKING ENTITIES, DRAFT LAWS, ACTS AND THE NORMS CONTAINED THEREIN THAT ACCOMPANIED THE INTERPRETED REGULATION, I.E. WERE ADOPTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE INTERPRETED NORM, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL TECHNIQUE. THE AUTHORS SUPPOSE THAT HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A HOMOGENEOUS WAY OF INTERPRETATION. IN REALITY, THE HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION IN LAW CAN BE CARRIED OUT USING DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND METHODS, IN RELATION TO HETEROGENEOUS LEGAL PRESCRIPTIONS, AND CARRIED OUT BY SUBJECTS WITH DIFFERENT LEGAL STATUS. THEREFORE, SEVERAL GROUNDS FOR CLASSIFYING HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION ARE PROPOSED. FIRST, IT IS A CLASSIFICATION THAT CONSIDERS THE CONNECTION OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION WITH THE OTHER WAYS OF INTERPRETATION. ACCORDING TO THIS CRITERION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVIDE IT INTO A PROPER HISTORICAL AND A COMPLEX HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION. COMPLEX HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION INCLUDES HISTORICAL-SYSTEMATIC, HISTORICAL-FUNCTIONAL, HISTORICAL-TELEOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL-LEGAL, AND HISTORICAL-LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION. SECOND, THE BASIS MAY BE THE SOURCES OF LAW THAT CONTAIN THE RULES OF LAW. ON THIS BASIS, HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION IS DIVIDED INTO THE INTERPRETATION OF PRESCRIPTIONS OF NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS, LEGAL CUSTOMS, NORMATIVE CONTRACTS, ETC. THIRD, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CLASSIFY THE HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS VALID OR NOT, INTO THE HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES THAT HAVE LOST THEIR LEGAL FORCE AND THE HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF THE CURRENT LAW. THE LATTER, IN ITS TURN, IS DIVIDED INTO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CURRENT LEGAL NORMS OF THE CURRENT CONTENT AND THOSE LEGAL NORMS THAT HAVE NOT LOST THEIR FORCE BUT ARE OUTDATED IN CONTENT. THE FOURTH CLASSIFICATION IS BASED ON SUBJECTS AND INCLUDES HISTORICAL OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION AND HISTORICAL UNOFFICIAL INTERPRETATION. CONCLUSIONS. CORRECT APPROACH TO THE CONCEPT AND PROCESS OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTENT OF LEGAL NORMS, AS WELL AS THE CHOICE OF THE TYPE OF HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION HELPS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, ALLOWS YOU TO PUT FORWARD SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES, PREDICT THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF LAW BASED ON HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERPRETED NORM, ASSESS THE POSSIBILITY OF REVIVING CANCELED ACTS IN RECURRING SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL-LEGAL SITUATIONS.
536	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE TRANSNATIONAL FLOW OF STATE, NON-STATE AND SUPRANATIONAL NORMS GOVERNING OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) DERIVATIVES AT BOTH THE CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY LEVEL. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE FLOW OF THESE NORMS HAS FASHIONED A MULTI-LAYERED TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. THE FLOW OF NORMS INVOLVES THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES OF 'UPLOADING' BY POWERFUL MARKETS AND 'DOWNLOADING' BY PERIPHERAL STATES. ASYMMETRY IN ECONOMIC POWER BETWEEN STATES DRIVES THE TRANSNATIONAL FLOW OF NORMS, WHICH ARE CARRIED BY PLAYERS SUCH AS FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES, PROFESSIONALS, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND REGULATORS. WE OBSERVE THAT VARIOUS FACTORS MAY AFFECT THE OUTCOMES OF TRANSNATIONAL FLOW, RESULTING IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CONVERGENCE OR DIVERGENCE IN PERIPHERAL STATES. WE EXAMINE THE NORMS GOVERNING OTC DERIVATIVES AND FIND THAT THE TRANSNATIONAL FLOW OF CONTRACTUAL NORMS (SPECIFICALLY THE INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION MASTER AGREEMENT) RESULTS IN A HIGH DEGREE OF CONVERGENCE. HOWEVER, THE DOWNLOADING OF REGULATORY NORMS DEPENDS ON THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER NATIONAL INTERESTS OF PERIPHERAL STATES. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT POWERFUL STATES CAN EXPECT SMALLER MARKETS TO ACCEPT UPLOADED NORMS WHEN THE BENEFITS INVOLVED ARE RECIPROCAL AND THE NORMS DO NOT CONFLICT WITH MORE PRESSING LOCAL CONCERNS. UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS, THEREFORE, REGULATIONS CAN BE GLOBALLY HARMONISED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.
537	THE EU FDI SCREENING REGULATION (THE REGULATION) IS AN INTERESTING APPLICATION OF THE `INTEGRATION BY STEALTH' THEORY TO THE SPHERE OF INVESTMENT SCREENING. THE REGULATION LEADS TO INTEGRATION IN THE SENSE THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COMMISSION IS GRANTED A ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTMENT SCREENING WITHIN THE EU. HOWEVER, COMMISSION INVOLVEMENT COMES AT THE COST OF SIMULTANEOUSLY STRENGTHENING THE HANDS OF THE MEMBER STATE SCREENING AUTHORITIES, LEADING TO A SUBOPTIMAL POLICY OUTCOME WHEREBY NEITHER THE COMMISSION NOR THE MEMBER STATES MAY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO SCREEN INVESTMENTS QUICKLY AND THOROUGHLY, AS IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT. THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE REGULATION ARE LIKELY TO TRIGGER CALLS FOR FURTHER REFORM. TO DEVELOP THIS ARGUMENT, THIS ARTICLE (1) LEGALLY EXAMINES THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE REGULATION AND (2) EXPLORES THE INTERPLAY OF THE REGULATION WITH EU FREE MOVEMENT RULES. THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW THE REGULATION IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO AN UPTAKE IN NATIONAL SCREENING DECISIONS, BUT NOT TO A CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN ENFORCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMISSION OR THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU. THIS CREATES AN ENFORCEMENT GAP, WHICH MAY PUT PRESSURE ON THE EXISTING FREE MOVEMENT FRAMEWORK AND MAY RISK ENCOURAGING MEMBER STATES TO DEVELOP A NATIONAL AS OPPOSED TO A COMMON EU CONCEPTION OF PUBLIC SECURITY AND ORDER.
538	FACED WITH A CHANGING GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS EMBARKED ON A LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM TO UPGRADE ITS UNILATERAL TRADE INSTRUMENTS TOOLBOX. BY REFORMING EXISTING INSTRUMENTS-FOR EXAMPLE, ANTI-DUMPING-AND BY ADDING NEW INSTRUMENTS TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S TOOLBOX (FOREIGN SUBSIDIES INSTRUMENT, INTERNATIONAL PROCUREMENT INSTRUMENT, ANTI-COERCION INSTRUMENT, AND OTHERS), THE EU LEGISLATURE IS SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENING THE POSITION OF THE COMMISSION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF UNILATERAL TRADE POLICY IN THE EU. THIS DEVELOPMENT RAISES ACCOUNTABILITY QUESTIONS. BY MEANS OF A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN UNILATERAL TRADE POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU, I DESCRIBE THIS TRANSFORMATION OF EXECUTIVE POWER IN THE EU AND I ARGUE THAT A FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS IS NEEDED TO MATCH THE COMMISSION'S GROWING RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS UNDEREXAMINED CORNER OF EU TRADE POLICY.
539	THIS ARTICLE REVISITS THE TWO SEMINAL ALIEN TORT STATUTE (ATS) CASES FILARTIGA V. PENA-IRALA AND IN RE: MARCOS HUMAN RIGHTS LITIGATION. SETTING ASIDE THE DOMINANT FRAMEWORK OF ACCOUNTABILITY, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVES PRODUCED IN THOSE CASES. IT EXPOSES HOW FILARTIGA AND MARCOS RECAST AS ENTIRELY FOREIGN VIOLENCE IN WHICH THE US EXECUTIVE WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED, DUE TO A COMBINATION OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS IN THE EXERCISE OF A CONTROVERSIAL FORM OF JURISDICTION. MOREOVER, THESE CONSTRAINTS HAVE PERSISTED IN SUBSEQUENT ATS LITIGATION, CREATING A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND NARRATIVES ABOUT US HEGEMONY. BY OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT OF ATS LITIGATION AND EXPOSING HITHERTO IGNORED COSTS OF FAMILIAR LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS, THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE ASSUMPTION THAT BROAD ASSERTIONS OF JURISDICTION ARE NECESSARILY BENEFICIAL IN HUMAN RIGHTS STRUGGLES, AND URGES INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE INTERPLAY AMONG DOCTRINE, POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND HISTORICAL NARRATIVE WHEN CONSIDERING AND COMPARING HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS.
540	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE BUDGET DEFICIT BY USING A PANEL DATASET OF 66 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2020. IN THE FIRST STAGE REGRESSIONS, THE CURRENT STUDY EMPLOYS FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECT MODELS TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT. IN THE SECOND STAGE REGRESSION, POOLED MEAN GROUP (PMG) AND MEAN GROUP (MG) ESTIMATION METHOD IS EMPLOYED FOR ESTIMATING THE LONG-RUN AND SHORT-RUN COEFFICIENTS FOR THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN A HETEROGENEOUS PANEL DATASET. THE EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES CONFIRM THAT GDP PER CAPITA IS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE LONG RUN. FURTHER, INFLATION RATES AND TRADE OPENNESS ALSO HAVE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE LONG RUN. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BUDGET DEFICIT. AS FAR AS INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ARE CONCERNED, THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT AN INCREASE IN CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE BUDGET DEFICIT. HOWEVER, POLITICAL STABILITY, IMPROVED BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET DEFICIT. THE CURRENT STUDY WILL HELP POLICYMAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DETERMINANTS OF THE BUDGET DEFICIT AND TO DESIGN THE POLICIES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WHICH, IN TURN, MAY CONTROL THE LEVEL OF A BUDGET DEFICIT.JEL CODES: H5, H6, H3, H4
541	ALTHOUGH RAOUL VAN CAENEGEM CLAIMED OTHERWISE, HE HAD VERY STRONG VIEWS ON WHAT LEGAL HISTORY SHOULD BE. IN HIS OPINION, LEGAL HISTORY BELONGED TO THE DISCIPLINARY FIELD OF HISTORY, NOT TO LAW. THE LEGAL HISTORIAN SHOULD NOT ONLY CHRONICLE PAST EVOLUTIONS OF THE LAW, BUT ALSO EXPLAIN THEM. TO THIS PURPOSE, VAN CAENEGEM HIMSELF TURNED TO SOCIOLOGY, TRYING TO WORK WITH TYPES AND MODELS IN ORDER TO GENERALISE. VAN CAENEGEM REJECTED THE IDEA OF A VOLKSGEIST AND ADVOCATED TO LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT IN A COMPARATIVE LEGAL HISTORY. NEVERTHELESS, HIS 'EUROPE' WAS LIMITED TO THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, JOINED BY ENGLAND. HE CONSTRUCTED LEGAL HISTORY AS A HISTORY OF POWER AND PREFERRED TO STUDY GROUPS OF LAW MAKERS INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUALS. IN HIS LEGAL HISTORY, THE EUROPEAN 'SECOND MIDDLE AGES', FROM 1100 UNTIL 1750, STAND OUT AS THE CRADLE OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW, WITH A SPECIAL ROLE FOR THE CITIES OF MEDIEVAL FLANDERS. ALTHOUGH WELL-KNOWN FOR A LEADING HANDBOOK PROMOTING THE IDEA OF THE IUS COMMUNE, THE COMMON LAW OF EUROPE, VAN CAENEGEM ACTUALLY DEEMED CUSTOM TO HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LAW IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE, WHEREAS THE ROLE OF THE IUS COMMUNE HAD BEEN, IN HIS OPINION, OVERESTIMATED. AS HE SHOWED MANY TIMES DURING HIS DISTINGUISHED CAREER, VAN CAENEGEM WANTED LEGAL HISTORIANS TO TAKE PART IN CURRENT DEBATES. IN THE END, HIS MAIN LESSON FROM LEGAL HISTORY WAS A PLEA FOR MODERATION, AS TAKING A SOUND IDEA TO ITS EXTREME LEADS TO ABSURD OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
542	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO GAIN NEW KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE IN WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES AND ITS EFFECTS ON PUBLIC FINANCE SUSTAINABILITY. IT INCLUDES AN ESTIMATION OF THE VOLUME OF ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE, IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING THE KEY FACTORS THAT CAUSE ILLEGAL TOBACCO TRADE, THE EFFECTS OF ILLEGAL TOBACCO TRADE ON PUBLIC FINANCE SUSTAINABILITY, AND THE EFFECTS ON THE INTENSITY OF TOTAL TOBACCO TRADE. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING THE DATA COLLECTED BY FIELD RESEARCH ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES (BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, CROATIA, KOSOVO, MACEDONIA, MONTENEGRO, SERBIA, AND SLOVENIA). THE REFERENCE RESEARCH PERIOD IS THE YEAR 2018. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW A HIGH VARIABILITY OF VOLUME OF ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE IN WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES. WHILE MORE THAN 20% OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN MONTENEGRO AND BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA ARE BOUGHT ON THE GRAY MARKET, A SHARE OF ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE LOWER THAN 5% IS FOUND IN SLOVENIA AND MACEDONIA. UNDERDEVELOPED INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FIGHTING AGAINST ILLICIT TRADE AND WEAK RULE OF LAW, COUPLED WITH THE HEAVY TAXATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS, ARE THE KEY FACTORS BEHIND A HIGHER INTENSITY OF ILLICIT TRADE IN COMPARISON TO MORE DEVELOPED EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ECONOMIES. ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE STABILITY OF PUBLIC FINANCE OF WESTERN BALKAN ECONOMIES AND REDUCES THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEM COMBATING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF SMOKING. REGULAR AND ILLICIT TOBACCO TRADE AMONGST WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES IS FOUND TO FLOW IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
543	PUBLIC LEGISLATION HAS LONG FAILED TO MEET SUCH LARGE-SCALE CHALLENGES AS THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC. IN EMERGENCIES, TO PROTECT THE LIVES AND HEALTH OF THE POPULATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO PROMPTLY MAKE DECISIONS ON THE LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED DUE TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE STATE HAS CREATED LEGAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND WHICH NEED THE SCIENTIFIC-LEGAL ASSESSMENT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE WORK IS TO ANALYZE THE NOVELTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL LEGISLATION, WHICH REGULATE THE LIABILITY FOR VIOLATION OF QUARANTINE. THE OBJECT OF RESEARCH IS THE NORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL LAW. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF QUARANTINE AND WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL LAW. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE SITUATION IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WAS FIRSTLY ANALYZED; GENERAL PATTERNS WERE IDENTIFIED; ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS WERE PROPOSED, WITH A MINIMUM RESTRICTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THEN, THE NOVELTIES OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION WERE STUDIED IN MORE DETAIL; ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WERE IDENTIFIED; AND A MORE BALANCED LEGISLATIVE POLICY WAS PROPOSED. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, THE CURRENT STATE OF LEGAL REGULATION IN THE AREAS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL LAW RELATED TO QUARANTINE VIOLATIONS WAS ANALYZED; THE LIABILITY FOR SUCH OFFENSES WAS CHARACTERIZED; SOME CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE EXISTING RELATED PROBLEMS WERE MADE AND OPTIONS FOR THEIR SOLUTION WERE PROPOSED, AS WELL AS PROPOSITIONS FOR MODERNIZATION OF LEGISLATION WERE MADE.
544	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA'S ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JURISPRUDENCE IN 2016-18 TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE THAT THE COURT AFFORDED TO ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKERS AND TO ASSESS WHERE THE LAW MAY BE HEADED NEXT. THE COURT'S VOTING PATTERNS INDICATE THAT ITS MEMBERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POLARIZED, MOVING AWAY FROM THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNANIMITY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY PREVAILED IN THIS AREA. LED BY JUSTICE SUZANNE COTE, A MINORITY OF JUSTICES HAVE FREQUENTLY DISSENTED OR CONCURRED IN ORDER TO DISAGREE ON EITHER THE IDENTIFICATION OR THE APPLICATION OF THE STANDARD OF REVIEW. THESE JUSTICES HAVE TAKEN A MORE INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH, VOTING TO APPLY THE CORRECTNESS STANDARD AND TO OVERTURN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AT HIGHER RATES THAN THE REST OF THE COURT. THIS QUANTITATIVE POLARIZATION REFLECTS DOCTRINAL DISAGREEMENTS ON BASIC QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKERS SHOULD BE PRESUMED TO HAVE EXPERTISE RELATIVE TO THE COURTS IN INTERPRETING THEIR ENABLING STATUTES, WHETHER THERE IS ANY ROOM IN THE STANDARD OF REVIEW ANALYSIS FOR EITHER THE CONCEPT OF JURISDICTION OR A CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY, WHETHER LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY OR THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD TAKE PRECEDENCE, AND WHETHER THE STANDARD OF REVIEW ANALYSIS SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A SINGLE REASONABLENESS STANDARD. LOOKING AHEAD TO THE COURT'S FORTHCOMING RECONSIDERATION OF DUNSMUIR V NEW BRUNSWICK, WHICH APPROACH PREVAILS MAY BE DETERMINED BY JUSTICE MICHAEL MOLDAVER, WHOSE VOTING PATTERN ON THE ISSUE HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT, AND THE COURT'S NEWEST MEMBER, JUSTICE SHEILAH MARTIN, WHOSE VIEWS ON THE STANDARD OF REVIEW ANALYSIS ARE NOT KNOWN.
545	OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE DECADES, U.S. PRESIDENTS HAVE EXPERIMENTED WITH THE USE OF PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS-WRITTEN DOCUMENTS ISSUED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE SIGNING OF A LAW. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, THE UNITED STATES HAS WITNESSED A MASSIVE PROLIFERATION IN THE NUMBER OF PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING-STATEMENT OBJECTIONS, INCLUDING THE RESERVATION OF THE RIGHT TO NOT ENFORCE OR NOT COMPLY WITH THE LAW. DEBATES OVER THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SIGNING STATEMENTS LED TO THE DRAFTING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS ACT OF 2006, WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT THE JUDICIARY FROM UTILIZING SIGNING STATEMENTS FOR STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION. THE PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS ACT WOULD G,RANT CONGRESS STANDING TO SEEK A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT REGARDING A SIGNING STATEMENT THAT PURPORTS TO INTERPRET THE LAW. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS ACT DOES NOT DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE PROBLEM OF SIGNING STATEMENTS. AN EXAMINATION OF THE STATEMENTS DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY CONVEY A MESSAGE OF AN ENTRENCHED PRESIDENCY THAT IS ANTAGONISTIC TOWARD THE OPERATION OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. THIS CONTROVERSIAL MESSAGE IS A GREATER DANGER THAN USING THE STATEMENTS AS ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF STATUTORY LAW. BY FOCUSING ON THE POSSIBLE JUDICIAL USE OF SIGNING STATEMENTS AND THE WAY THE SIGNING STATEMENTS ERODE THE CONGRESS'S POWER TO MAKE THE LAW, THE PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS ACT FAILS TO ADDRESS THE MORE URGENT PROBLEMS THAT THESE STATEMENTS POSE: ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED DISRUPTION TO THE RULE OF LAW, REJECTION OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND OBSTRUCTION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AND ITS NEED FOR INFORMATION AND RECIPROCITY.
546	AGAINST THE CONTEXT OF PENDING JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BETWEEN THE STATE OF PALESTINE AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (US) AT THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ), THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) COMMITMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF ITS CONSIDERATION OF PALESTINE'S 2011 APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION. THE UNIVERSALITY OF MEMBERSHIP OF THE UN IS A FOUNDATION UPON WHICH THE ORGANIZATION RESTS. THE INTERNATIONAL LAW GOVERNING UN ADMISSION HAS ACCORDINGLY BEEN MARKED BY A LIBERAL, FLEXIBLE AND PERMISSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE TEST FOR MEMBERSHIP CONTAINED IN THE UN CHARTER. IN CONTRAST, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE UN'S CONSIDERATION OF PALESTINE'S APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP DEMONSTRATES THAT IT WAS SUBJECTED TO AN UNDULY NARROW, STRICT AND RESULTANTLY FLAWED APPLICATION OF THE MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA. AN EXAMINATION OF THE CONTEMPORANEOUS DEBATES OF THE COUNCIL DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MAIN DRIVER OF THIS WAS THE US, WHICH USED ITS LEGAL AUTHORITY AS A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL TO BLOCK PALESTINE'S MEMBERSHIP. THE PRINCIPLE ARGUMENT USED AGAINST MEMBERSHIP WAS THE US'S VIEW THAT PALESTINE DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A STATE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE STATE OF PALESTINE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY 139 MEMBER STATES OF THE UN AND HAS ACCEDED TO A NUMBER OF TREATIES THAT FURNISH IT WITH ACCESS TO THE ICJ. WHILE A NUMBER OF ARTICLES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT PALESTINE'S STATEHOOD, LITTLE HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON THE UN'S CONSIDERATION OF PALESTINE'S 2011 APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP. PALESTINE V. USA PROVIDES A RENEWED OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.
547	CHINA'S INCREASED TRADE WITH, AND INVESTMENT IN, AFRICA HAVE BOOSTED THE CONTINENT'S ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT HAVE ALSO GENERATED CONSIDERABLE CONTROVERSY. THE AGGREGATE DATA ON CHINA'S OVERSEAS DIRECT INVESTMENT (ODI) IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES REVEAL THAT CHINA'S SHARE OF THE STOCK OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS SMALL, THOUGH GROWING RAPIDLY. CHINA'S ATTRACTION TO RESOURCE- RICH COUNTRIES IS NO DIFFERENT FROM WESTERN INVESTMENT. CHINA'S OVERALL ODI IS UNCORRELATED WITH A MEASURE OF RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS WESTERN INVESTMENT FAVORS THE BETTER GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENTS. AS A RESULT, CHINESE INVESTMENT IN STRONG AND WEAK GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENTS IS ABOUT THE SAME, BUT ITS SHARE OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IS HIGHER IN THE WEAK GOVERNANCE STATES. MICRO DATA FROM MOFCOM'S DATABASE ON REGISTERED CHINESE FIRMS INVESTING IN AFRICA BETWEEN 1998 AND 2012 PROVIDE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. KEY WORDS IN PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS ARE USED TO CODE THE INVESTMENTS INTO 25 SECTORS. THIS DATABASE CAPTURES THE SMALL AND MEDIUM PRIVATE FIRMS INVESTING IN AFRICA. CONTRARY TO COMMON PERCEPTIONS, THERE ARE FEW PROJECTS IN NATURAL RESOURCE SECTORS. MOST PROJECTS ARE IN SERVICES, WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER IN MANUFACTURING AS WELL. COUNTRY-SECTOR-LEVEL REGRESSIONS BASED ON FIRMS' TRANSACTION-LEVEL DATA FIND THAT CHINESE ODI, BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL, IS PROFIT-DRIVEN, LIKE INVESTMENT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, REGRESSIONS SHOW THAT CHINESE ODI IS RELATIVELY MORE CONCENTRATED IN SKILL-INTENSIVE SECTORS IN SKILL-ABUNDANT COUNTRIES BUT IN CAPITAL-INTENSIVE SECTORS IN CAPITAL-SCARCE COUNTRIES. THESE PATTERNS ARE MOSTLY OBSERVED IN POLITICALLY UNSTABLE COUNTRIES, SUGGESTING STRONGER INCENTIVES TO SEEK PROFITS IN TOUGHER ENVIRONMENTS.
548	BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE WTO IN 2001 WAS A HISTORIC EVENT OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE DURING THE PROCESS OF CHINA'S REFORM AND OPENING UP. SINCE THEN, CHINA HAS STEADILY PUSHED FORWARD THE REFORM AND OPENING UP POLICY, PROACTIVELY SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND POSITIVELY UTILIZING THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM TO DEVELOP ECONOMIC AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF 21ST CENTURY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON CHINA'S FUTURISTIC ROLE IN THE WTO, AND THOSE DISAGREEMENTS RESULTING FROM VARIOUS INTEREST PREFERENCES ARE NOT ONLY ONE-SIDED AND LIMITED, BUT ALSO TRIGGERING OFF THE DISCUSSIONS ON THE CRITERIA TO ASSESS CHINA'S PERFORMANCE IN THE WTO. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA'S ACTIVITIES IN THE WTO (I.E., IMPLEMENTING WTO COMMITMENTS, PARTICIPATING IN THE DOHA ROUND NEGOTIATION, THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AND TRADE POLICY REVIEW) SHOULD BE A KIND OF ASSESSMENT CRITERIA. BASED ON COMPREHENSIVE OBSERVATION OF CHINA'S PERFORMANCE IN THE WTO, IT IS CONCLUDED IN THIS ARTICLE THAT CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE WTO SYSTEM AND GLOBAL TRADE GOVERNANCE EXTENDS THE SCOPE OF WORLD TRADE LAW, IMPROVES ITS EFFECTIVENESS, CONSTITUTES CHINA'S NEW CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT TREATY OBLIGATIONS IN GOOD FAITH, RESOLVES PEACEFULLY INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES, AND MAINTAINS SUBSTANTIVELY THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS NOT ONLY CAUSED NEW DRIVING FORCES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM, BUT ALSO MADE CHINA FACE NEW CHALLENGES IN THE WTO.
549	THE PREVENTIVE DETENTION OF DANGEROUS OFFENDERS INVOLVES DETAINING INDIVIDUALS TO KEEP THEM FROM COMMITTING CRIMES IN THE FUTURE. IN TERMS OF LOGIC, THIS IDEA SOUNDS GOOD; AFTER ALL, PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF CRIMES COMMITTED. THIS ESPECIALLY HOLDS TRUE FOR SERIOUS CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE, MURDER, AND OTHER OFFENSES THAT ENDANGER LIFE AND LIMB, WHICH PREVENTIVE DETENTION PRIMARILY AIMS TO IMPEDE. PREDICTING WHO WILL COMMIT PARTICULAR CRIMES IN THE FUTURE IS, UNFORTUNATELY, NO EASY TASK; THERE IS NO WAY OF FORESEEING FUTURE ACTS AS WAS POSSIBLE IN THE SHORT STORY MINORITY REPORT WRITTEN BY PHILIP DICK. IN REALITY, PREDICTIONS TEND TO SWAY ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION. VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT RISK ASSESSMENTS OF CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS SIGNIFICANTLY OVERPREDICT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL REOFFEND. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RATIONALE FOR THE PRACTICE OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION AND ATTEMPTS TO CAST LIGHT ON WHETHER AND ON WHAT BASIS IT IS JUSTIFIABLE TO DETAIN PEOPLE FOR PREVENTIVE PURPOSES. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT PREVENTIVE DETENTION IS NOT JUSTIFIABLE BUT THAT IT IS DEFENSIBLE IF IT IS APPLIED IN A LIMITED MANNER. THE LABEL OF A DANGEROUS OFFENDER MUST BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. FURTHERMORE, THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH OFFENDERS ARE DETAINED AND THE LENGTHS OF TIME SHOULD REFLECT THE PREVENTIVE PURPOSE OF DETENTION. BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION LEGISLATION AND ALSO IN TERMS OF HOW IT IS PROCEDURALLY APPLIED, THE RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS MUST BE COMPLIED WITH. IT IS ARGUABLE THAT PREVENTIVE DETENTION IS ONLY DEFENSIBLE IF ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS ARE ADEQUATELY SATISFIED.
550	THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO EXTEND RESEARCH ON THE ROLE OF VALUES FOR THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL AUTHORITIES BY FOCUSING ON (1) SUPRANATIONAL LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND (2) A BROAD RANGE OF VALUES. WE EXAMINE HOW (ALIGNMENT BETWEEN) PEOPLE'S PERSONAL VALUES AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE RELATED TO PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU (CJEU) AND THE EU MORE BROADLY. INSPIRED BY MORAL FOUNDATIONS THEORY, WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INDIVIDUALIZING (I.E., "DEMOCRACY", "LIBERTY", AND "FAIRNESS") AND BINDING VALUES (I.E., "RULE OF LAW", "RESPECT FOR NATIONAL AUTHORITY", AND "RESPECT FOR TRADITION"). AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN SIX EU MEMBER STATES (N = 1,136). A FACTOR ANALYSIS CONFIRMED A TWO-FACTOR MODEL (INDIVIDUALIZING VS. BINDING VALUES) FOR BOTH PERSONAL VALUES AND PERCEIVED EU VALUES. FOUR REGRESSION MODELS WERE RUN FOR EACH OF THE VALUE FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL VALUES, PERCEIVED EU VALUES, AND THEIR INTERACTION, ON EACH OF THE OUTCOMES (I.E., PERCEIVED CJEU AND EU LEGITIMACY). PERCEIVED ENDORSEMENT BY THE EU OF BOTH INDIVIDUALIZING AND BINDING VALUES PREDICTED HIGHER LEGITIMACY PERCEPTIONS OF THE CJEU AND EU. FURTHERMORE, PERSONAL BINDING VALUES HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PERCEIVED EU LEGITIMACY WHEN PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THE EU TO WEAKLY SUPPORT BINDING VALUES, BUT A POSITIVE EFFECT WHEN THE EU WAS PERCEIVED TO STRONGLY SUPPORT BINDING VALUES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VALUE ALIGNMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF THE CJEU AND EU, AND THAT BETTER REPRESENTING BINDING VALUES MIGHT BE A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE PERCEIVED EU LEGITIMACY.
551	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE SPANISH TRANSITION FROM A DICTATORSHIP TO A DEMOCRACY AS A PROCESS OF POLITICAL CHANGE DURING THE PERIOD FROM FRANCO'S DEATH IN 1975 UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE SOCIALISTS TO POWER IN 1982. OVER THIS PERIOD, THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAD REACHED A CONSENSUS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO RECONCILIATION AMONG THE SPANIARDS CULMINATING IN THE APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTION IN 1978, WHICH IN ITS TURN RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF A RULE-OF-LAW STATE. THE KEY PEOPLE OF THE TRANSITION WERE KING JUAN CARLOS I, WHO SUPPORTED THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM; ADOLFO SUAREZ, WHO BECAME AN ACTIVE STATEMAN UNDER FRANCO'S REGIME, AND WAS APPOINTED HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BY THE KING DURING THE TRANSITION; AND TORCUATO FERNANDEZ MIRANDA, PRESIDENT OF THE FRANCO'S COURTS. DURING THE TRANSITION THE SECTARIANISM WAS ABANDONED, AND A SHARED IDEA AROSE THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS A DEMOCRACY SIMILARLY TO OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AROUND US. THE TRANSITION HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A "MODEL" BECAUSE IT TOOK ROOT, AND DEMOCRACY QUICKLY CONSOLIDATED. IT HAS BECOME A HISTORICAL FEAT WITH NO PRECEDENTS, BUT ABOVE ALL WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS OCCURRED. THE TRANSITION WAS POSSIBLE THANKS TO GENUINE CONSENSUS AMONG THE SPANIARDS. RECENTLY, AN IDEA HAS EMERGED FROM THE COMMUNIST FAR LEFT, AND SOME SOCIALISTS, ALONG WITH SEPARATISTS, CONNECTED WITH THE 2008 CRISIS, WHICH CALLS FOR THE REPEAL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND THE MONARCHY. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS IDEA CONSIDER MONARCHY A CONTINUATION OF FRANCO'S REGIME. HOWEVER, IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE CONSTITUTION ENSURES AND GUARANTEES SPANIARDS' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.
552	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ORIGINS OF THE FORMATION OF THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP. EASTERN PARTNERSHIP IS BASED ON GRADUAL EVOLUTION RELATION TO EU NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. ENACTED AT THE SUMMIT OF THE "EASTERN PARTNERSHIP", HELD IN PRAGUE MAY 7, 2009, THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP POSES MANY PROBLEMS, INCLUDING - ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE COUNTRIES - PARTNERS IN THE EU, PROMOTING SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, STABILITY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE, PARTNERSHIP OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENTS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES, SECTORAL REFORMS TO ENCOURAGE CONTACTS BETWEEN PEOPLE USING THE VISA LIBERALIZATION AND INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE, STRENGTHEN ENERGY SECURITY, ADDRESS COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND SO ON. IN ADDITION, THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMBALANCES AND INCREASE STABILITY IN THE PARTNER COUNTRIES. THE MAIN TOOLS OF THE TASKS ARE NEW ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT WITH THE EU. HOWEVER, THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP IS NOT ONLY BILATERAL BUT ALSO MULTILATERAL DIMENSION OF POLITICAL AND EXPERT DIALOGUE THAT ENHANCES ITS POTENTIAL AND IS ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD POLICY. EASTERN PARTNERSHIP INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF "OFFICIAL" RELATIONSHIP BUT AS WELL, A NETWORK BUILDING BETWEEN ORDINARY CITIZENS, WHICH IS CALLED "PEOPLE TO PEOPLE CONTACTS". IT WAS FOUND THAT, DESPITE OPPOSING VIEWS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP FOR 5 YEARS SINCE ITS ADOPTION IN THE SHORT TERM, IT IS NOT ABOUT CURTAILING THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE NEW TOOLS AIMED AT THE CONVERGENCE OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EU IN VARIOUS AREAS. HOWEVER, THE TASK OF REFORMING THE EASTERN PARTNERSHIP AND THE BETTER THE POTENTIAL OF MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL COOPERATION.
553	IN 2006, CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE USA BEGAN ADOPTING 'ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION RELIEF ACTS' TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BURDEN THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WERE ALLEGEDLY PRESENTING. BY RESTRICTING THE ACCESS OF UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS TO HOUSING, JOBS AND SOCIAL SERVICES, LOCAL ORDINANCES WOULD ENCOURAGE UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS TO 'SELF-DEPORT' FROM THE LOCALITY IF NOT FROM THE NATION. HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS, POLITICALLY AND JURIDICALLY, LOCAL ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LAWS HAVE DIVIDED COMMUNITIES. PROPONENTS MAINTAIN THAT SUCH LAWS MERELY UPHOLD THE 'RULE OF LAW', WHILE OPPONENTS SEE THEM AS THINLY VEILED EFFORTS TO DRIVE OUT LATIN AMERICAN RESIDENTS, WITH IMMIGRATION STATUS SERVING AS A PROXY FOR RACE. A GROWING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINES LOCAL ANTI-IMMIGRANT LAW AND OFFERS SIGNIFICANT INSIGHTS INTO THE CAUSES AND UNDENIABLY RACIALIZED EFFECTS OF THESE LAWS. YET THE ISSUE OF RACISM REQUIRES MORE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. CRITICAL RACE THEORY HOLDS THAT ALL RACISMS ARE HISTORICALLY PARTICULAR AND MUST BE EXAMINED AS EXPRESSIVE OF PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURES. TO THAT END, THIS ESSAY DEVELOPS A THEORETICALLY INFORMED AND HISTORICALLY GROUNDED ANALYSIS OF LOCAL ANTI-IMMIGRATION LAW. IT ESTABLISHES LOCAL AND NATIONAL INTERESTS IN LOCAL ANTI-IMMIGRANT LAW AND EXPLAINS HOW THESE INTERESTS CONVERGE. THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY (PWC), VIRGINIA, I EXAMINE LOCAL ANTI-IMMIGRANT ACTIVISM AND CONNECT THEM TO LARGER POLITICAL SHIFTS IN THE CONTEMPORARY USA. I ARGUE THAT LOCAL WHITE PROPERTIED INTERESTS CONVERGE WITH NATIONAL CONSERVATIVE AND FEDERALIST INTERESTS IN THE COUNTY'S ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT LAW. THE ESSAY SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF BRINGING CULTURAL STUDIES METHODOLOGY TO BEAR ON (LOCAL) IMMIGRATION LAW.
554	THE RUSSIAN CONCEPT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM AIMED AT INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF POWER BY PUTTING IN ORDER, INVOLVING THE EXECUTIVE POWER IN THE WORK. IT IS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF REFORMING THAT AN INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION ACTUALLY EMERGES AND DEVELOPS. RELATIONS REGULATED BY THE REGULATIONS OF THIS INSTITUTE ARE THE REGULATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS, CONSOLIDATION OF THE LIMITATIONS FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND OFFICIALS INVOLVED. THE PURPOSE OF THE REGULATION IS TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS ARE FORMULATED IN THE ARTICLE AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING MAIN PROVISIONS. IMPROVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE INVOLVES A REFORM OF THE STATE, CREATION OF INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS OF THE STATE BODIES. THE LATTER IS A SET OF INTERRELATED ACTS OF THE STATE BODIES REGULATING THE COMMON OBJECT - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION PASSED THREE STAGES IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. AT THE FIRST STAGE (1990-2002) PREREQUISITES AND NEW FOR THE RUSSIAN BUREAUCRACY PROCEDURAL WAYS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES WERE CREATED. THE SECOND PHASE (2002 - THE BEGINNING OF 2006) IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE CREATION OF A NORMATIVE BASE OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION AND FORMATION OF THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS. THE THIRD STAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION WAS A STAGE OF ACTIVE MASS DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS FUNCTIONAL ORIENTATION. THE PROSPECT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION (THE FOURTH STAGE), IN OUR OPINION, IS THE FORMATION OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS.
555	THE TRIAL OF KAING GUEK EAV, ALIAS DUCH (CASE 001), AT THE EXTRAORDINARY CHAMBERS IN THE COURTS OF CAMBODIA (ECCC) WAS THE FIRST IN THE HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN WHICH SURVIVING VICTIMS OF ALLEGED CRIMES COULD PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AS CIVIL PARTIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE INTERVIEWED ALL 75 CIVIL PARTIES RESIDING IN CAMBODIA, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAD ULTIMATELY BEEN DENIED CIVIL PARTY STATUS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRIAL IN CASE 001. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN PARTICIPATING IN THE ECCC PROCEEDINGS. THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH DATA FROM A NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CAMBODIAN CIVIL PARTIES VIEWED POSITIVELY THEIR OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING AND TESTIFYING. HOWEVER, CIVIL PARTIES WHO HAD THEIR STATUS DENIED FELT ANGER, HELPLESSNESS, SHAME, AND WORTHLESSNESS. COMPARED TO THE OVERALL POPULATION WHO LIVED UNDER THE KHMER ROUGE, CIVIL PARTIES WERE MORE NEGATIVE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE TRIAL ON THEIR (1) ACCEPTANCE OF LOSS AND REACHING CLOSURE, (2) FORGIVENESS OF THE PERPETRATORS, AND (3) PERCEPTIONS AS TO WHETHER THE TRIAL HAD IMPROVED THE RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA. MANY CIVIL PARTIES LACKED UNDERSTANDING ABOUT KEY ASPECTS OF THE TRIAL, INCLUDING SENTENCING. THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF VICTIMS' PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCEEDINGS, BUT ALSO SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPATION ALONE IS UNLIKELY TO BRING ABOUT HEALING, CLOSURE, AND RECONCILIATION FOR THE VICTIMS. FUTURE INTERNATIONAL COURTS MUST DEVELOP THE RESOURCES AND MECHANISMS THAT ENSURE A MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION OF VICTIMS, AND ENGAGE PARTICIPANTS IN A DIALOGUE OVER PROCEDURES AND EXPECTATIONS.
556	THE ISSUE OF WHEN, HOW AND WHY THE COURT MAY REMEDY THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION IS LARGELY UNEXPLORED. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISCRETION AND THE CHARTER AND ARGUES FOR A BROADER, MORE CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO REMEDYING THE SOURCE OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL DISCRETION. GUIDANCE AS TO HOW TO EXERCISE BROAD DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY COMES IN THE FORM OF "SOFT LAW," WHICH ENCOMPASSES A VARIETY OF NON-LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS POLICY GUIDELINES AND TRAINING MATERIALS, AND WHICH, MORE INFORMALLY, EXTENDS TO ADMINISTRATIVE CULTURE. ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION INVOLVES CHOICES AND JUDGEMENTS USUALLY SHAPED BY A RANGE OF LEGAL, BUREAUCRATIC, SOCIAL AND PERSONAL, FACTORS. UNDER PRESENT JURISPRUDENCE, THE LESS PRECISE A STATUTORY DISCRETION AND THE GREATER THE RELIANCE ON NON-LEGISLATIVE GUIDELINES, THE MORE DIFFICULT THAT DISCRETION WILL BE TO SUBJECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL SCRUTINY. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THIS LOGIC AND CONCLUDES THAT RESPECT FOR GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRE BRINGING SOFT LAW OUT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SHADOWS. THE FIRST PART OF THE ANALYSIS EXAMINES THE REGULATION OF DISCRETION GENERALLY AND SOFT LAW SPECIFICALLY OUTSIDE THE CHARTER. THE SECOND PART ANALYSES THE LEADING CASE LAW ON THE REGULATION OF DISCRETION UNDER THE CHARTER. THE THIRD SECTION EXPLORES THE INTERSECTION OF DISCRETION, SOFT LAW AND THE CHARTER. FINALLY, THE FOURTH SECTION CONSIDERS THE PROBLEM OF REMEDYING UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXERCISES OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY. ALTERNATIVE PRINCIPLES ARE SUGGESTED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF SOFT LAW, WHICH ENVISIONS A CENTRAL ROLE FOR THE CHARTER IN RENDERING THE DISCRETIONARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND JUST.
557	THIS DOCUMENT ATTEMPTS TO REFLECT CRITICALLY ON THE FUNCTION OF ALTERNATIVE LEGAL EDUCATION AS A PILLAR OF THE CLINICAL METHOD, FROM A BROAD CONTEXTUAL HINDSIGHT OF THE GLOBAL PHENOMENON OF COVID-19 AND ITS NATIONWIDE IMPACTS, AND HOW IT DEMONSTRATES THE REAL DISABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW TO EXTEND SOCIAL JUSTICE AROUND THE WHOLE POPULAR CORPUS. THIS ARGUMENT AFFIRMS THE NEED TO DECOLONIZE THE LAW AS A REPRODUCER OF COLONIALITY OF BEING, OF KNOWLEDGE AND POWER. THE WORKING METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS. FIRST, IT IS PROPOSED AS A PRELUDE TO AN INVITATION TO OVERCOME THE LEGAL-CENTRIC OR TRADITIONALIST VIEWS OF LAW THAT HAVE NOT QUESTIONED THE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION OF CRISIS ON BEHALF OF THE MODERN/COLONIAL/CAPITALIST STATE. THE BACKBONE CATEGORY OF HIDDEN PEOPLE ALLOWS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISCRIMINATION AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION AGGRAVATED BY COVID-19 ARE CROSSED BY RACISM, AS A RESULT OF COLONIALITY. THESE BACKBONE CATEGORIES (RACISM AND COLONIALITY) ARE BUILT AS EXPLANATORY PILLARS OF THE DOUBLE EXCEPTION STATE PHENOMENA, THAT EMERGES IN PERIPHERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. IN THIS SCENARIO, OUR GOAL IS TRYING TO CLARIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIO-LEGAL, CLINICAL METHOD AND THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION FROM AN INTEGRAL, SOCIAL AND SOLIDARY POINT OF VIEW. THE OBJECTIVE IS PROPOSING AS A HORIZON THE NECESSITY OF RETHINKING THE CLINIC METHOD WITH THE INTEGRATION OF OTHER KNOWLEDGE THAT ENRICH THE JURIDIC EDUCATION IN CONTEXT AND THAT ALLOWS THE USE OF TRADITIONAL TOOLS OF PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AS INPUTS FOR A COUNTER-HEGEMONIC FIGHT, CAPABLE OF FRACTURING THE STRUCTURAL MATRIX OF COLONIALITY.
558	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE AND OTHER POTENTIAL BANK-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITION DETERMINANTS ON BANK PRODUCTIVITY IN THE PERIOD OF 2006-2016. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL OF TOTAL 167 BANKS SELECTED FROM MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, BRUNEI AND SINGAPORE ARE EVALUATED USING THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS-BASED MALMQUIST PRODUCTIVITY INDEX METHOD. A PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK BASED ON ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES, A FIXED EFFECT AND A RANDOM EFFECT MODELS THEN ARE USED TO IDENTIFY ITS MAIN DETERMINANTS. FINDINGS THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY CHANGES OF ISLAMIC BANKS IS HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONAL BANKS. THE LIQUIDITY AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS INFLUENCE BOTH BANKS' PRODUCTIVITY. BANK SIZE, CREDIT RISK, MARKET POWER, MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY AND INFLATION MERELY INFLUENCE ISLAMIC BANKS' PRODUCTIVITY. ON THE COUNTRY GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE FOUND TO POSITIVELY INFLUENCE BOTH BANKS' PRODUCTIVITY. REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW (RL) SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES THE CONVENTIONAL PARTS. POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RL AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE BANKS' PRODUCTIVITY, BUT THIS INFLUENCE IS ONLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE ISLAMIC BANKS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE COUNTRY GOVERNANCE HAS RECEIVED SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES. MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES THAT EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON BANK PERFORMANCE HAVE FOCUSED MORE ON THE MICRO GOVERNANCE DIMENSION. THUS, TO THE BEST OF THE RESEARCHER'S KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDY HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THE EFFECT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS.
559	EXISTING LITERATURE HAS CARRIED OUT FRUITFUL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION POLICIES. DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN POLICIES, REGIONS, AND DATA ANALYSIS METHODS, HOWEVER, THE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE NOT REACHED A CONSENSUS ON THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION POLICIES, ESPECIALLY ON THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION POLICIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THIS PAPER TAKES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT IN CHINA'S INTERMEDIATE PEOPLE'S COURT AS A QUASI-NATURAL EXPERIMENT AND USES THE MULTI-PERIOD DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES METHOD TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT ON ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, BASED ON THE PANEL DATA OF 284 CITIES IN CHINA FROM 2003 TO 2019. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EMISSION INTENSITY OF INDUSTRIAL SO2 IN THE SHORT TERM. THIS REDUCTION EFFECT IS RESULTED FROM THE JOINT EMISSION REDUCTION EFFECT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT ON LOCAL CITIES AND ADJACENT CITIES. THE MECHANISM ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT HAS THE DUAL EFFECT OF EMISSION REDUCTION WITHOUT HINDERING ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS EFFECT IS MAINLY ACHIEVED BY IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, STIMULATING GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENT, AND IMPROVING THE GREEN FINANCE LEVEL. FURTHERMORE, THE EMISSION REDUCTION EFFECT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT SHOWS DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS UNDER THE CONSTRAINTS OF REGIONAL RULE-OF-LAW LEVEL, ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS, FISCAL PRESSURE, AND LEVEL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ADDITION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COURT CAN FACILITATE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CARBON PEAKING AND CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS.
560	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL SYSTEM. IT HAS ESPECIALLY INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN OVERSEAS INVESTMENT AND FOREIGN TRADE ACTIVITY OF ENTERPRISES. THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO CAUSE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND LEGAL RISKS (ESPECIALLY COMPLIANCE RISK AND DEFAULT RISK) FACED BY ENTERPRISES ENTERING FOREIGN MARKETS AND CARRYING OUT INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, ENTERPRISES NEED TO ENHANCE THEIR LEGAL AWARENESS, STRENGTHEN COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT OF OVERSEAS INVESTMENT BY ENTERPRISES AND CREATE A RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, AND CARRY OUT INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES ON THE PREMISE THAT THEY COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL RULES, THE LEGAL NORMS OF THE HOST COUNTRY AND THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ON THIS BASIS, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW CONCERNING FOREIGN AFFAIRS, IMPROVE RELATED GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS FOR OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE "OUTLINE OF THE 14TH FIVE-YEAR PLAN (2021-2025) FOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND VISION 2035 OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA", CHINA WILL IMPROVE ITS LEGISLATION ON OVERSEAS INVESTMENT, SUPPORT ENTERPRISES TO INTEGRATE INTO THE GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL AND SUPPLY CHAIN, IMPROVE THE TRANSNATIONAL OPERATIONAL CAPACITY AND LEVEL, AND GUIDE ENTERPRISES TO STRENGTHEN COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SO THEY CAN PREVENT AND RESOLVE OVERSEAS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SECURITY RISKS. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ENHANCES FRIENDLY COOPERATION IN THE LEGAL FIELD AND ESTABLISHES WORKING MECHANISMS FOR CONSULTATION AND COORDINATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. MUCH ATTENTION IS PAID TO CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF STRENGTHENING RISK ASSESSMENT METHODS AND RISK MANAGEMENT FOR ENTERPRISES ENGAGING IN OUTWARD INVESTMENT.
561	RECENT CRITIQUES OF ATTEMPTS TO GROUND CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY IN THE CONSTITUENT POWER OF A STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGN HAVE TENDED TO FOCUS UPON THE TENSION BETWEEN STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND CENTRAL ASSUMPTIONS OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. FOREMOST AMONG THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE NEED TO RECONCILE DISAGREEMENT REGARDING CONTROVERSIAL MATTERS OF COMMON CONCERN AND THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE WEAKNESS OF SUCH CRITIQUES, HOWEVER, IS THAT THEY PRESUPPOSE A COMMITMENT TO LIBERAL PRINCIPLES AND VALUES THAT AN ADVOCATE OF STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY NEED NOT SHARE. IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT RECOURSE TO LIBERAL ASSUMPTIONS IS UNNECESSARY IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE INABILITY OF A THEORY OF STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY TO ISSUE IN A VIABLE ACCOUNT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY. THEORIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY GROUNDED IN STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND CONSTITUENT POWER, I CONTEND, SIMPLY LACK THE BASIC RESOURCES FOR AN ADEQUATE THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT OFFER NORMATIVE GROUNDS FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER ANY PARTICULAR CONSTITUTION IS OR IS NOT LEGITIMATE. THE PAPER IS STRUCTURED IN THREE SECTIONS. SECTION 1 DEMONSTRATES THAT CARL SCHMITT'S THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY - WHICH REMAINS THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CONTEMPORARY APPEALS TO STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND CONSTITUENT POWER - SUSTAINS A NORMATIVE INTERPRETATION. SECTION 2 THEN DEVELOPS A MINIMAL CONSTRAINT ON AN ADEQUATE NORMATIVE THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY. FINALLY, IN SECTION 3, I DEMONSTRATE WHY A NORMATIVE ACCOUNT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY BASED ON STRONG POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND CONSTITUENT POWER IS, AT LEAST WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTATION FROM NORMATIVE CONCEPTS DERIVED FROM A WEAKER CONCEPTION OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, UNABLE TO MEET THIS CONSTRAINT.
562	CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AFTER FALL OF SOEHARTO'S NEW ORDER BRING FAVORABLE DIRECTION FOR JUDICIARY. CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS REGULATED IN ART 24 (1) OF THE 1945 CONSTITUTION, CLOSING DARK MEMORIES IN THE PAST. IN ADDITION, IN ART 24 (2) OF THE 1945 CONSTITUTION DECIDE THE JUDICIARY IS HELD BY THE SUPREME COURT AND THE JUDICIAL BODIES BELOW AND A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. SUCH A STRICT DIRECTION OF REGULATION PLUS THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN A DEMOCRATIC DIRECTION SHOULD BRING ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS JUDICIARY. BUT IN REALITY, EVEN THOUGH IN A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT AFFIRMS THE GUARANTEE OF INDEPENDENCE, BUT IT DOESN'T REPRESENT THE ACTUAL SITUATION. THERE SOME PROBLEM WHICH STILL REMAINS, SUCH AS (I) THE ABSENCE OF A PERMANENT FORMAT REGARDING THE INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SUPREME COURT, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND JUDICIAL COMMISSION, AND (II) STILL MANY EFFORTS TO WEAKEN JUDICIARY THROUGH MANY WAYS SUCH CRIMINALIZATION OF JUDGE. REFERRING TO THE PROBLEM ABOVE, THEN THERE ARE GAPS BETWEEN WHAT "IS" AND WHAT "OUGHT", AMONG OTHERS, FIRST, BY CHANGES POLITICAL CONFIGURATION THAT TEND TO BE MORE DEMOCRATIC, AND THE JUDICIARY SHOULD BE MORE AUTONOMOUS. SECOND, BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, THERE WILL BE NO LEGISLATION WHICH REDUCED CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS AND DESCRIBES IN-DEPTH ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE UNDER DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AFTER FALL OF NEW ORDER AND CONCEPTUALIZE ITS ORDER TO STRENGTHENING RULE OF LAW IN INDONESIA
563	SINCE THE OSLO ACCORDS WERE SIGNED BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) IN SEPTEMBER 1993, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS SUPPORTED CIVIL POLICING PROGRAMMES. IT HAS DONE SO AS PART OF ITS DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS TO PALESTINIAN STATE-BUILDING. SUCH PROGRAMMES WERE, UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF THE SECOND INTIFADA IN 2000, LARGELY REGARDED AS SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN CIVIL POLICE (PCP). SUCH PROGRAMMES WERE ESSENTIALLY WESTERN IMPORTED MODELS WHICH LOOSELY MIXED COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC ORDER POLICING APPROACHES. WITH RE-ENGAGEMENT IN THE PALESTINIAN SECURITY SECTOR (PSS) IN THE WEST BANK IN 2007, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ONCE AGAIN SOUGHT TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN PSS REFORM. THIS ROLE INCLUDES SUPPORTING REHABILITATION AND RETRAINING OF THE PCP AS A PRINCIPAL INSTITUTION OF STATE-BUILDING. SUCH ACTIVITIES ALONGSIDE THE SO-CALLED TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS WITHIN THE WIDER REALM OF THE PSS HAVE RE-ESTABLISHED AS THEIR GOAL LAW AND ORDER. WITHIN THE TRANSFORMATION AGENDA, THERE ARE INHERENT DEMANDS WITH RESPECT TO ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY'S SECURITY AND COUNTERTERRORISM AGENDAS. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINES THESE ACTIVITIES, AND ACCOMPANYING POLITICAL INTENT TO CONTEND THAT SUCH APPROACHES ARE UNDERMINING PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC POLICING INCLUDING CIVIL POLICE PRIMACY (CPP). CPP REINFORCES POLICE UNIVERSALITY AND MEANS SUPPORTING RULE OF LAW BY PUTTING SECURITY UNDER GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL WITH PROPER MECHANISMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUPPORT TO THE SECURITY SECTOR IN THE WEST BANK HAS INCREASINGLY ONLY PAID LIP SERVICE OR SOUGHT TO SUBVERT NORMATIVE APPROACHES TO DEMOCRATIC POLICING.
564	FACED WITH THE URGENT AND GRAVE THREAT OF WMD TERRORISM, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS RESPONDED WITH A NEW APPROACH OF INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION BY ADOPTING SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1540. THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH OF MULTILATERAL TREATIES ON WMD HAS PRIMARILY BEEN AIMED AT THE PREVENTION OF PROLIFERATION OF SUCH WEAPONS TO STATES AND NOT TO NON-STATE ACTORS. ANOTHER TRADITIONAL APPROACH OF UTILISING ANTI-TERRORISM TREATIES HAS BEEN A SORT OF PATCHWORK, AND THUS PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE THAT A NEW TREATY IS MADE IN A TIMELY MANNER IN RESPONSE TO A NEWLY EMERGING TYPE OF TERRORISM. BY CONTRAST, THE NEW APPROACH OF INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION THROUGH COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ENACT RULES THAT LEGALLY BIND ALL UN MEMBERS IMMEDIATELY AND AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT EXCEPTION AND ARE EQUIVALENT TO THOSE IN A TREATY INSTANTLY RATIFIED BY ALL UN MEMBERS. INDEED, A NEW THINKING IS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO A NEW, URGENT AND GRAVE THREAT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN THAT SENSE, RESOLUTION 1540 IS WELCOME. THIS DOES NOT, HOWEVER, MEAN THAT EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED IF IT IS EFFECTIVE TO DEAL WITH THE PRESENT OR IMMINENT THREAT. NOT ONLY FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF LEGITIMACY, WHICH GUARANTEES THE LONG-STANDING EFFECTIVENESS, BUT ALSO FROM THAT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IT SEEMS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THAT WE DISCUSS IN THIS ARTICLE, IF INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS DESTINED TO BECOME INEVITABLE IN THE FUTURE AND IS TO BE BETTER IMPLEMENTED.
565	I AM UNDERTAKING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND THEATRE. I SHALL EXPLORE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND THEATRE BY CONSIDERING CASE STUDIES IN WHICH LEGAL PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RE-PRESENTED OR REPRODUCED AS THEATRE. SUCH CASE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN UNDENIABLE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN LAW AND THEATRE. IN BOTH DISCIPLINES, PERFORMANCE AND THUS PLAY, ALBEIT VERY DIFFERENT FORMS OF PLAY, ARE CENTRAL. YET THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEGAL AND THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES. I SHALL EXAMINE THESE DIFFERENCES, ARRIVING, FINALLY, AT VIOLENCE: LEGAL PERFORMANCES ARE ANCHORED IN VIOLENCE AND THEATRICAL PERFORMANCES ARE NOT. A COMPARISON BETWEEN LAW AND THEATRE IS NOT A PURELY WHIMSICAL ONE. INCREASINGLY, AS GIORGIO AGAMBEN HAS ASSERTED, MODERN WESTERN SOCIETIES RESEMBLE A SCHMITTIAN 'STATE OF EXCEPTION' IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME POWERLESS IN THE FACE OF ARBITRARY ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LANGUAGE OF EXCEPTIONALISM HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE. 1 CONTEMPORARY LEGAL PERFORMANCES IN THE FORM OF HIGHLY MEDIATISED TERROR TRIALS ARE EXAMPLES OF STATE-ORCHESTRATED SPECTACLE, IN WHICH THE VIOLENCE OF THE STATE IS BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THE ENEMY: INDIVIDUALS WHO THEMSELVES HAVE NOT YET COMMITTED ACTS OF TERRORISM BUT WHO ARE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE AS TERRORISTS DUE TO RACIAL AND/OR RELIGIOUS CHARACTERISTICS. IN SUCH A CONTEXT, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND, IF SO, HOW, LEGAL PERFORMANCES CAN BE UNCOUPLED FROM STATE VIOLENCE IS WORTH EXPLORING. I SHALL ARGUE THAT RE-POSITIONING THE PLAY OF LAW IN MORE PLAYFUL CONTEXTS OFFERS IMAGINATIVE POSSIBILITIES FOR SUCH AN UNCOUPLING.
566	DESPITE THE SALIENCE OF TRANSPARENCY IN POLICY AND DEMOCRACY DEBATES A GLOBAL MEASUREMENT OF TRANSPARENCY HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISSING. IT ITS ABSENCE, MEASURING THE IMPACT OF TRANSPARENCY ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRUPTION FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, WITH SCHOLARS USING MORE OR LESS ADEQUATE PROXIES. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A NEW MEASUREMENT OF REAL TRANSPARENCY-THE T-INDEX-USING 14 DE FACTO COMPONENTS, BASED ON DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF OFFICIAL WEBSITES IN 129 COUNTRIES AND FIVE DE JURE COMPONENTS, BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND CONVENTIONS ADOPTED. THE RESULTING INDEX IS A MEASUREMENT WITH VERY GOOD INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALIDITY AND MODERATE PRECISION. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT DE FACTO TRANSPARENCY MUST BE CONSIDERED ALONGSIDE DE JURE (LEGAL) TRANSPARENCY IF WE ARE TO JUDGE THE IMPACT (OR LACK OF) TRANSPARENCY AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRUPTION, AS A LARGE IMPLEMENTATION GAP EXISTS, IN PARTICULAR IN POOR COUNTRIES, BETWEEN LEGAL COMMITMENTS AND REAL TRANSPARENCY. THE T-INDEX HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BOTH PERCEPTION AND OBJECTIVE INDICATORS OF CORRUPTION, INCLUDING PERCEIVED CHANGE IN CORRUPTION OVER TIME AS MEASURED BY THE GLOBAL CORRUPTION BAROMETER. AN ANALYSIS OF OUTLIERS SHOWS THAT HIGH TRANSPARENCY ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND POOR RULE OF LAW, ALTHOUGH TRANSPARENCY IS A ROBUST PREDICTOR OF CORRUPTION WITH GDP CONTROLS. THE DATA WITH ALL SOURCES IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AS T-INDEX 2022 DATASET: DOI 10.5281/ZENODO.7225627 AND AN INTERACTIVE WEBPAGE DEVELOPED FOR UPDATES IS AVAILABLE AT WWW.CORRUPTIONRISK.ORG/TRANSPARENCY.
567	WHAT ROLE DID JUDICIAL COURTS PLAY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLY MODERN HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE? SCHOLARS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE FRAMEWORKS OF JUDICIALIZATION (WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE PEACEFUL CHANNELLING MECHANISMS OF LAW) AND OF INSTRUMENTALIZATION (WHICH UNDERSCORES THE POLITICAL USES AND ABUSES OF LAW) ARE UNSATISFACTORY FOR FULLY DESCRIBING THE WAYS IN WHICH HIGH COURTS SHAPED AND PARTICIPATED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE OF THE EARLY MODERN EMPIRE. YET HISTORIOGRAPHY ON THE REFORMATION CASES CONTINUES TO OPERATE WITHIN THIS RULE-OF-LAW/POLITICS DICHOTOMY. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW WAY OF CONSIDERING THE CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE REFORMATION CASES BY ANALYSING USES OF A LEGAL INSTRUMENT-THE PROTESTATIO-IN THE CONTEXT OF CIVIL LITIGATION. WHILE THE PROTESTATION IS WELL-KNOWN FOR ITS USES IN THE CONTEXT OF IMPERIAL DIETS, ITS USES IN COURT-AND IN PARTICULAR ITS CENTRALITY TO THE PROTESTANT LITIGATION STRATEGY-HAVE BEEN IGNORED. THIS STUDY ILLUMINATES NOT ONLY A MORE COMPLETE ACCOUNT OF THE ROLE OF LAW AND LITIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION, BUT ALSO A HITHERTO NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF THE ROLE OF COURTS IN CONSTITUTING RELATIONS AMONG THE EMPIRE'S RULERS, CENTRED ON LITIGATIVE PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES-THE CONSTITUTIONAL CULTURE OF LITIGATION. IT ARGUES THAT THE WORK OF LITIGATION ITSELF-NOT ONLY IN ITS JURISPRUDENCE OR THE SUBSTANTIVE INTERPRETATIONS MADE, BUT ALSO IN THE FORMS AND LANGUAGE THROUGH WHICH LITIGANTS WERE REQUIRED TO OPERATE AND ARGUE-HAD A DISTINCTIVELY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONSTITUTING RELATIONS AMONG THE RULERS OF THE EARLY MODERN HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE.
568	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN BOTSWANA. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TRANSMISSION CHANNELS TO GROWTH ARE INVESTIGATED. FINANCIAL INTEGRATION COMMONLY INFLUENCES GROWTH THROUGH ENCOURAGING CROSS BORDER CAPITAL FLOWS, TRANSFERRING TECHNOLOGIES AND MANAGERIAL EXPERTISE AND PROMOTING RISK SHARING. THESE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE REALIZED TRANSLATE INTO ENHANCED ACCESS TO FINANCE AS INTERMEDIATION CHANNELS IMPROVE. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS ARE IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS LITERATURE IN THAT FINANCIAL DEPTH DOES OCCUR IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATION ERA AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCES GROWTH IN BOTSWANA. NOT WITHHOLDING, OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT MARKET DEPTH HAS NOT PROMOTED ACCESS TO PRIVATE SECTOR'S CREDIT IN BOTSWANA SO FAR. TO A LARGER EXTENT, A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INTEGRATION ON GROWTH IS OBSERVED AS THERE COULD BE SHORT-TERM RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FINANCIAL OPENNESS. NONETHELESS, AN INDIRECT, SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE INFLUENCE FROM FINANCIAL INTEGRATION THROUGH FINANCIAL ACCESS TO GROWTH IS ALSO OBSERVED. THIS INDIRECT TRANSMISSION DEMONSTRATES THAT FINANCIAL INTEGRATION INCREASES FINANCIAL INNOVATION WHICH IN TURN FOSTERS GROWTH IN THE COUNTRY. FINANCIAL INNOVATION ENHANCES SERVICE DELIVERY AND IMPROVES ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE OBSERVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE FROM MACROECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES IMPLYING PREVALENCE OF SOUND AND PRUDENT SUPERVISORY STRUCTURE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN BOTSWANA. POLICY WISE, THERE IS STILL NEED AND SCOPE FOR GREATER FINANCIAL INTEGRATION, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCIAL ACCESS WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE TO NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH, DIVERSIFICATION, EMPLOYMENT CREATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION IN BOTSWANA.

569	THIS RESEARCH'S QUESTION IS "IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNAL NORMS THAT REGULATE THE ACTIONS OF STF'S PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY: DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN THE COURT AND/OR ACCOUNTABILITY ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW?" PRIMARILY, IT IS NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE STF STRUCTURE. THERE WERE 57,056 ACTIONS - UP UNTIL AUGUST 24, 2015 - AWAITING APPRECIATION AT BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT, ACCORDING TO DATA PROVIDED BY THE INSTITUTION ITSELF. LATER, ONE NEEDS TO COMPREHEND HOW THE INTERNAL PROCEDURE TO ORGANIZE ITS SCHEDULE WORKS. INTERNAL RULES GRANT THE PRESIDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT THE POWER TO DECIDE ABOUT WHAT WILL BE HEARD BY THE MINISTERS, ALTHOUGH NORMATIVE RESPONSES ABOUT CRITERIA TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ARE OBSCURE OR, AT LEAST, INSUFFICIENT, FOR THEIR LACK OF OBJECTIVITY. THIS PAPER POSITS THAT, IF "FIRST COME, FIRST HEARD" IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA IN SCHEDULING, THE COURSE OF THE CASES IN THE COURT ARE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESIDENT'S WHIM, AND HENCE THERE ARE NO LEGAL LIMITS FOR HIS OR HER DECISIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE PRESIDENT IS NOT SELECTED FOR THIS SPECIFIC TASK BY ANY AUTHORITIES, BUT ELECTED BY HIS OR HER PEERS - ACCORDING TO A TRADITION THAT DICTATES THAT THE OLDEST IN COURT SHOULD BE PRESIDENT. THE SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF A COURT RENOWNED FOR THE WIDE PUBLICITY - LIVE BROADCAST ON TV AND RADIO, TWITTER E YOUTUBE, AND OTHERS - CONTRASTS WITH THE COMPARATIVE LACK OF CONTROL OVER ITS TRIAL SCHEDULE. THIS RESEARCH DESCRIBES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE FACTORS OVER THE COURT'S SCHEDULE AND REFLECTS UPON ITS DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
570	DURING THE 1970S, THE WESTERN EUROPEAN STATES MOST SEVERELY HIT BY LEFT-WING TERRORIST ATTACKS AND MURDERS WERE ITALY AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC. THE INTERDEPENDENCY OF TERRORISM, STATE AND SOCIETY SHAPED THE WHOLE DECADE FOR BOTH DEMOCRACIES. IN BOTH STATES, THE POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST TERRORISM SHOW SEVERAL CONCURRENCES, ALBEIT WITH A DELAY. HERE AND THERE, THE SECURITY APPARATUS WAS BROADLY EXPANDED AND THE PENAL CODE WAS MADE MORE STRINGENT. YET THERE WERE ALSO DIFFERENCES PECULIAR TO THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. WHILE THE SOCIAL-LIBERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEMATICALLY (AND FOR A LONG TIME SOMEWHAT ONE-SIDEDLY) EMPHASISED THE POLICE AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, ITALIAN GOVERNMENT POLICY REACTED MORE FLEXIBLY AND STROVE FOR DE-ESCALATION THROUGH DIALOGUE AT A MUCH EARLIER DATE. IT WAS FORCED TO DO SO DUE TO THE FACT THAT LEFT-WING TERRORISM POSSESSED MANY MORE ADHERENTS IN ITALY AND WAS THEREFORE MORE DANGEROUS THAN IN GERMANY. ALL IN ALL, BOTH STATES SUCCEEDED IN FENDING OFF NOT ONLY TERRORISM, BUT ALSO RADICAL CONCEPTS TO FIGHT IT. DESPITE MISGIVINGS, THE RULE OF LAW WAS NEVER IN DANGER. THESE FEARS WERE MORE EXTENSIVE IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC THAN IN ITALY, WHERE WORRIES OF A "WEAK STATE" PREVAILED AND THERE WAS GENERAL RELIEF WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ACTED MORE DECISIVELY THAN EXPECTED. IN GERMANY HOWEVER, FEAR OF A "SURVEILLANCE STATE" CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE "NEW SOCIAL MOVEMENTS" AT THE END OF THE DECADE, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. IN THIS RESPECT, THE CONFRONTATION WITH TERRORISM ULTIMATELY ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO A STRENGTHENING OF LIBERAL CIVIL SOCIETY.
571	DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SET OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION EMERGED IN POSTWAR GERMANY IN THE LATE 195OS AND EARLY 196OS, TRIGGERED BY THE JUDGEMENT OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN THE SO-CALLED "LUTH CASE". IN THIS JUDGEMENT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COURT CLEARLY ARTICULATED THE POSITION THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE AN OBJECTIVE VALUE SYSTEM THAT EXTENDS ITS LEGAL FORCE TO ALL BRANCHES OF LAW, INCLUDING CIVIL LAW.ONE OF THE FIERCEST CRITICS OF THE COURT DECISION WAS ERNST FORSTHOFF, A DISCIPLE OF CARL SCHMITT. IN A SERIES OF ARTICLES, HE ATTACKED THE "VALUE" LEGAL INTERPRETATION, POINTING OUT THAT IT LEADS NOT ONLY TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LEGAL METHOD AND THE LOSS OF JURISPRUDENCE AUTONOMY, BUT ALSO TO CHANGES IN THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE STATE. E. FORSTHOFF'S CRITICISM WAS PREDOMINANTLY JURIDICAL, FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS ON THE THEORETICAL-LEGAL ORIGINS OF VALUE INTERPRETATION WHICH HE FOUND IN R. SMEND'S "INTEGRATION THEORY".IN CONTRAST, C. SCHMITT, IN TYRANNY OF VALUES, PRACTICALLY OMITTED LEGAL ARGUMENTS AND ATTACKED THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF THE GERMAN COURT'S POSITION. RELYING ON M. WEBER, THE GERMAN LEGAL SCHOLAR ATTEMPTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF VALUE INTERPRETATION BY CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE MEANS THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF VALUES, WHICH DESTROYS THE RULE OF LAW. DESPITE THE DIFFERENT TRENDS OF CRITICISM, THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY E. FORSTHOFF AND C. SCHMITT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT SIMILARITY IN THAT BOTH CALL FOR THE AUTONOMY OF LEGAL SCIENCE AND A RETURN TO THE FORMAL LEGAL STATE.
572	ON 30 JUNE 2022, RUSSIA ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE DECREE WHICH TERMINATED THE PARTICIPATION OF MITSUI CORPORATION AND MITSUBISHI CORPORATION IN THE SAKHALIN-2 GAS PROJECT. THIS MEASURE APPEARS TO VIOLATE, INTER ALIA, ARTICLES 3(1) AND 5 FOR THE JAPAN-RUSSIA BIT DUE TO ITS APPARENT DISCRIMINATORY NATURE, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A RETALIATORY COUNTERMEASURE AGAINST JAPAN WHO FROZE RUSSIAN ASSETS IN PROTEST OF ITS INVASION OF UKRAINE. MITSUI AND MITSUBISHI HAVE NOT INITIATED ANY INVESTMENT ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AGAINST RUSSIA BEFORE ICSID, A RIGHT WHICH ARTICLE 11 OF THE BIT AFFORDS THEM. BASED ON PAST INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT JURISPRUDENCE, MITSUI AND MITSUBISHI APPEAR TO HAVE SOLID CLAIMS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN AWARDS IN THEIR FAVOUR. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IN A BID TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW TO OTHER WATCHFUL INVESTORS, RUSSIA WOULD HAVE COMPENSATED THESE INVESTORS. HOWEVER, JUDGING BY RUSSIA'S RECENT INVASION OF UKRAINE, WHICH LED MANY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO SANCTION IT, RUSSIA DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO APPEASE INVESTORS AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS RESPECT FOR THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. ARTICLE 3 OF THE NEW YORK CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION PROVIDE AVENUES FOR ENFORCEMENT IN COURTS IN JAPAN AND IN THIRD COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN ENFORCING ARBITRAL AWARDS AGAINST STATE ASSETS, THIS ARTICLE SUBMITS THAT DESPITE THE APPARENT BREACHES OF THE BIT, THESE INVESTORS WILL ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES IN ENFORCING ANY EVENTUAL ARBITRAL AWARDS HANDED DOWN BY A TRIBUNAL.
573	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE AND DETERMINE THE FACTORS THAT REINFORCE THE PRECARIOUSNESS EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN IN CANCUN, MEXICO'S MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL TOURISM CITY. FOR THIS RESEARCH, WE FOLLOW THE LITERATURE ON THE STRUCTURE OF COLONIALITY, AS WELL AS CRITICAL RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DOMINATION AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. WE IDENTIFY THREE ASPECTS. FIRST, THE MECHANISMS INHERITED FROM THE SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION SINCE COLONIZATION BETWEEN CENTRAL (WESTERN) AND PERIPHERAL (NON-WESTERN) ACTORS. SECOND, THE FRACTURE OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC BUILT BY TOURISM BETWEEN TOURISTS AND LOCALS. THIRD, THE PATRIARCHAL STRUCTURE THAT PARTICULARLY AFFECTS WOMEN. WE ASK OURSELVES TO WHAT EXTENT THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS HAS NOT MODIFIED A POSTCOLONIAL SOCIETY FOR WOMEN. WE SHOW THIS THROUGH THE STUDY OF A THREEFOLD EVENT: A FEMINICIDE, THE PROTEST IT TRIGGERED AND THE IMPLAUSIBLE REPRESSIVE RESPONSE OF THE STATE. WE REALIZE THAT BRINGING THE DEBATE ON FEMICIDES TO THE PUBLIC ARENA IN CANCUN IMPLIES A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER (BECAUSE THE CITY DEPENDS ON ITS INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION). USUALLY, RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT CONCENTRATES ON ONE OR TWO VARIABLES; OUR WORK CONTRIBUTES TO THE STATE OF THE FIELD BY INTERTWINING MULTIPLES WAYS OF DOMINATION EXPERIENCED BY WOMAN WHO SUFFER MOST FROM THE SO-CALLED INTERSECTIONALITY (RACISM, CLASSISM, XENOPHOBIA, HETEROSEXISM). THIS ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY WOMEN IN CIVIL SOCIETY DEMONSTRATING AGAINST GENDER VIOLENCE CAN BE REPRESSED WITH IMPUNITY. WE CONCLUDE WITH THE FACT THAT OPPRESSION IS PHYSICAL BUT ALSO LEGAL (JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW) AND THAT BOTH ARE PENDING ISSUES IN THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS.
574	PURPOSE THE GLOBAL SPOTLIGHT IS INCREASINGLY SHONE ON THE SITUATION OF WOMEN IN THE MALE-DOMINATED PRISON ENVIRONMENT. AFRICA HAS OBSERVED A 24% INCREASE IN ITS FEMALE PRISON POPULATION IN THE PAST DECADE. THIS YEAR IS THE 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS RULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN PRISONERS AND NON-CUSTODIAL MEASURES FOR WOMEN OFFENDERS (THE BANGKOK RULES) ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ON 21 DECEMBER 2010. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH USING A LEGAL REALIST APPROACH, THIS PAPER EXAMINES SOUTH AFRICA'S PROGRESS IN ADOPTING THE BANGKOK RULES. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE PENAL SYSTEM SINCE COLONIAL TIMES, FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECOGNITION, PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF INCARCERATED WOMEN'S SITUATION OVER TIME. FINDINGS THE ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES, THE NON-BINDING INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS, AFRICAN COURT AND DOMESTIC JURISPRUDENCE AND EXTANT ACADEMIC AND POLICY-BASED LITERATURE IS COGNIZANT OF THE EVOLUTIONARY NATURE OF RACIAL SOCIO-POLITICAL DIMENSIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE INDETERMINATE NATURE OF APPLICATION OF HISTORICAL/EXISTING DOMESTIC LAWS, POLICIES AND STANDARDS OF CARE WHEN EVALUATED AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN NO LEGAL REALIST ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION OF WOMEN IN SOUTH AFRICA'S PRISONS. THIS PAPER INCORPORATES RACE AND GENDERED INTERSECTIONALITY AND MOVE BEYOND HETERO-NORMATIVE IDEOLOGIES OF INCARCERATED WOMEN AND THE PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION IN SOUTH AFRICAN RIGHTS ASSURANCE. THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE STATE POLICY-MAKING PROCESSES, AND THEY ARGUE FOR SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY OF ALL WOMEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIBERTY IN SOUTH AFRICA.
575	LEAVING YEAR 2017 CHINA'S MACROECONOMY IS CONTINUOUSLY CHARACTERIZED BY UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT. WHEREAS SOME AGGREGATE INDICATORS HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE YEAR, THE CUMULATIVE GROWTH RATES IN CONSUMPTION AND FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT HAVE CONTINUED THEIR DOWNWARD TRAJECTORIES. WORSENING INCOME INEQUALITY AND RESOURCE MISALLOCATIONS, BOTH BETWEEN SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INDUSTRIES, AND WITHIN THE LATTER, POSE SERIOUS CHALLENGES, LET ALONE THE SYSTEMIC RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLOURISHING SHADOW BANKING SYSTEM, RAPID CREDIT GROWTH AND DEBT OVERHANG THAT WEIGH ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY LIKE THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES. THIS SUMMARY REPORT HIGHLIGHTS BOTH THE STATUS QUO AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT EMBODIED IN CHINA'S PERSISTENTLY DISTORTED ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, AND THE ROLE OF DEEPENING REFORMS OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE IN RESOLVING THE PROBLEMS. OUR ANALYSES BASED ON IAR-CMM MODEL PROVIDE A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING CHINA'S SHORT-, MEDIUM-, AND LONG-TERM ISSUES IN AN INTERNALLY COHERENT MANNER. LOOKING INTO YEAR 2018, OUR BENCHMARK PROJECTION OF REAL GDP GROWTH RATE IS 6.7% (6.41% USING MORE RELIABLE RATHER THAN THE OFFICIAL DATA). ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO ANALYSES AND POLICY SIMULATIONS ARE CONDUCTED TO REFLECT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN THE SHORT TO LONG RUNS. THROUGH THE LENS OF THESE ANALYSES WE CONCLUDE THAT RULE-OF-LAW BASED AND MARKET-ORIENTED STRUCTURAL REFORMS SHOULD CONTINUE TO HOLD A CENTER STAGE IN CHINA'S TRANSITION FROM A PHASE OF HIGH-SPEED BUT UNBALANCED GROWTH, TO A STAGE OF BALANCED AND ADEQUATE HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENT.
576	THIS STUDY EXPLORED TWO ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA: (1) MOTIVATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH 4 GROUPS OF EVERYDAY LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND (2) DETERMINANTS OF THE LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL AUTHORITIES. WE APPLIED A STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS MODEL, CONSTRUCTED FROM TYLER'S CONCEPTUAL PROCESS-BASED SELF-REGULATION MODEL WITH MORALITY ADDED AS A MOTIVATION, TO ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES FROM 1,000 SHANGHAI DRIVERS. WE EXPLORED THE COMPLIANCE WITH FOUR PARTICULAR GROUPS OF LAWS: PUBLIC DISTURBANCE; CONVENTIONAL TRAFFIC LAWS; ILLEGAL DOWNLOADING; AND DISTRACTED DRIVING. THE RESULTS WERE THREEFOLD. FIRST, FOR ALL FOUR GROUPS OF LAWS, THE PERCEIVED MORALITY INFLUENCED COMPLIANCE CONSISTENTLY AND MORE STRONGLY THAN THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF THE AUTHORITIES AND ALL OTHER MOTIVATIONS. THE INFLUENCE OF PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF AUTHORITIES WAS INCONSISTENT ACROSS THE FOUR GROUPS OF LAWS TESTED. SECOND, THE INFLUENCE OF PERCEIVED SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT WAS CONSISTENT AND SIGNIFICANT ACROSS ALL FOUR GROUPS OF LAWS, WHEREAS PERCEIVED RISK OF APPREHENSION HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON COMPLIANCE. THIRD, EVALUATIONS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, NOT THOSE CONCERNING THE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WERE MOST STRONGLY LINKED TO LEGITIMACY. IN ADDITION TO SHOWING THAT CHINA IS A LAW-ABIDING SOCIETY GOVERNED BY MORALITY, THESE RESULTS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF EXAMINING MORALITY AND MAGNITUDE OF PUNISHMENT AS POTENTIAL MOTIVATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE IN ADDITION TO LEGITIMACY AND CERTAINTY OF PUNISHMENT. THEY ALSO ILLUSTRATE THE NECESSITY TO EXAMINE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LAWS SEPARATELY WHEN STUDYING COMPLIANCE. FINALLY, THESE RESULTS CHALLENGE THE LINKAGE BETWEEN LEGITIMACY AND COMPLIANCE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED IN THE LITERATURE.
577	THE ARTICLE CONTAINS AN ANALYSTS OF THE PROFOUND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED IN POLAND IN THE YEARS 2015 - 2017. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE LEGAL CHANGES THAT IMPLY A TRANSITION FROM LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM TOWARDS AN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM AND THAT PROVOKED A REACTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE CAUSED IN DECEMBER 2017 THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEDURE OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE EU TREATY SO THAT POLAND RESPECTS THE COMMON VALUES OF THE EU. THE MAIN PROBLEMS THAT CAUSED THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS ARE PRESENTED IN THE ARTICLE. THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON INSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL ASPECTS, DEVOTING THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO THE MATTER OF INTERFERENCE IN THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED WITH CONSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY (INCLUDING CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AND SUPREME COURT). IN THE CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR PRESENTS A SCHEME USED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY TO QUESTION THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE. FIRST ELEMENT ARE THE RAPID LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS THAT COME INTO FORCE WITHOUT ADEQUATE ADAPTATION PERIOD. THE SECOND MECHANISM USED ARE THE AMENDMENTS THAT DO NOT RESPECT THE REQUIREMENT OF PERIODICITY OF MANDATES - THE LEGISLATOR ARBITRARILY CUTS EVEN THOSE TERMS WHOSE DURATION DERIVES DIRECTLY FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS. THE THIRD ELEMENT OF THE SCHEME TS THE PRACTICE OF IMPLEMENTING THE POPULIST SLOGAN ACCORDING TO WHICH THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY TS THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WILL OF THE NATION. THE LAST ELEMENT TS THE CREATION, BY MEANS OF ORDINARY LAWS, OF NEW PUBLIC BODIES THAT ASSUME THE COMPETENCES ORIGINALLY AWARDED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ENTITIES.
578	THE HISTORY OF THE ALASKAN FUR-SEAL CRISIS SHOWS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY-RELATED DISPUTES CAN OCCUR OVER THE VERY LONG TERM, THROUGH A DYNAMIC, ITERATIVE, AND CYCLICAL PROCESS THAT INVOLVES FOUR KEY STEPS: THE SORTING OF COMPETING INTERESTS; THE SIFTING OF EVIDENCE AND EXPERT OPINION; CONVERGENCE ON SHARED VALUES; AND THE ARTICULATION OF NEW REGULATORY REGIMES THAT REFLECT THOSE VALUES. THE FUR-SEAL DISPUTE FOLLOWED THIS PATTERN; IT OCCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF MORE THAN 25 YEARS DURING WHICH THE PARTIES INITIATED SEVERAL RESETS OF THE CYCLE UNTIL FINALLY REACHING A DURABLE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT GROUNDED IN A COM-MITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RATIONAL USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THE MAIN OBSTA-CLES THAT PREVENTED A MORE TIMELY AND EFFICIENT RESOLUTION WERE SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY AND RISK TO INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THE PARTIES FOUND THEY COULD NOT REACH AGREEMENT ON THE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE OF FUR-SEAL POPULATIONS, BUT THEY COULD AGREE ON A REGULATORY MODEL THAT INCENTED THE REALLOCATION OF PRIVATE CAPITAL AWAY FROM UNSUSTAINABLE ACTIVI-TIES, AND THAT PROVIDED FOR AN EQUITABLE SHARING OF PUBLIC REVENUES IN THE LONG TERM, INCLUDING THROUGH COMPENSATORY PAYMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR RESTRAINT IN THE EXERCISE OF LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS MANUSCRIPT TRACES THE ORIGINS OF THE DISPUTE AND THE STEPS TAKEN TO REACH A SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE SEVERAL JOINT SCIENTIFIC INQUIRIES COMMISSIONED BY THE PARTIES, AND INVITES DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE LESSONS OF THE FUR-SEAL CRISIS COULD BE APPLIED TO AVOID AND RESOLVE FUTURE BIODIVERSITY-RELATED DISPUTES.
579	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO FOCUS ON THE CONCEPT OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND EXPLORES THE EVOLUTION AND EXPANSION OF CRIMINALIZATION OF PREDICATE OFFENCES TO THE MONEY LAUNDERING WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING (AML) REGIME OVER THE TIME. IT PROPOSES HOW TO LIMIT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF PREDICATE OFFENCES IN DESIGNING A BALANCED LEGAL DEFINITION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER OPTED A CONTENT ANALYSIS FOCUSSED ON THE CRIMINALIZATION ASPECT OF OFFENCES TO MONEY LAUNDERING IN THE INTERNATIONAL AML REGIME UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS (VIENNA, PALERMO AND CORRUPTION CONVENTION) AND FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE STANDARDS. FINDINGS THIS PAPER PROVIDES HOW THE CRIMINALIZATION OF MONEY LAUNDERING HAS EVOLVED AND ITS DEFINITION EXPANDED OVER THE TIME. THE INTERNATIONAL DEFINITION IS WIDELY DRAFTED WITH WIDE RANGE OF PREDICATE OFFENCES FROM PROCEEDS OF DRUG MONEY TO CORRUPTION, INCLUDING TERRORIST FINANCING AND TERRORIST ACTS; HOWEVER, THE TWO PHENOMENA - MONEY LAUNDERING AND TERRORIST FINANCING ARE QUIET DISTINCT APART. THIS CONTINUAL EXPANSION OF PREDICATE OFFENCES QUITE LEADS LEGALITY ISSUES SUCH AS OVER-CRIMINALIZATION AND CONFLICT WITH PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS AN APPROACH TO LIMIT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF PREDICATE OFFENCES TO MONEY LAUNDERING. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS PAPER INCLUDES IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BALANCED APPROACH IN DEFINING PREDICATE OFFENCES THROUGH A QUALITATIVE LIMITATION APPROACH CONSISTENT WITH THE MINIMALIST THEORY OF PENALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER ATTAINS AN IDENTIFIED ISSUE HOW THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF THE MONEY LAUNDERING OFFENCE CAN BE IMPROVED WHILE CONSIDERING RULE OF LAW AND PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW CONCERNS.
580	THIS ARTICLE FIRST DISTINGUISHES "POLITICAL POPULIST" REGIMES, LIKE THAT OF TRUMP'S AMERICA, FROM "STRUCTURAL POPULIST" ONES, AS IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. IT THEN SHOWS HOW THE MAJOR TARGET OF STRUCTURAL POPULISM'S DETERMINED ASSAULT ON CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS RATHER THAN FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, POLITICAL AND CIVIL RIGHTS, OR THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE NEUTRALIZING ALL SOURCES OF INDEPENDENT AND DISPERSED POLITICAL POWER HAS BEEN THE DISTINCTIVE STRATEGY OF STRUCTURAL POPULISM, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE DEFENSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY MUST DEVELOP A SIMILAR DISCIPLINED FOCUS, IN THE FORM OF AN ANTI-CONCENTRATION PRINCIPLE THAT MAKES DISMANTLING SEPARATION OF POWERS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS ANTI-CONCENTRATION PRINCIPLE HAS A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IN PRACTICE, ADDRESSING THE MAJOR STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND DEMOCRATIC DESIGN, AND AMOUNTS TO A COUNTER-PLAYBOOK FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATS ON HOW TO INCREASE RESISTANCE TO, OR PREEMPTIVELY THWART, THE MOVES THAT HAVE PROVEN SO SUCCESSFUL OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. OF COURSE, RELYING ON CONSTITUTIONAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND DEMOCRATIC DESIGN TO RENDER THE CONCENTRATION OF POLITICAL POWER MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE IS NOT A PANACEA, AND CAN ONLY BE PART OF ANY SOLUTION TO THE THREATS POSED BY AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM, BUT IT IS NOT IRRELEVANT. IN PARTICULAR, THE COUNTER-PLAYBOOK THAT IS DEVELOPED AND PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE MAY HELP TO PREVENT POLITICAL POPULIST REGIMES FROM TRANSITIONING INTO THE MORE DANGEROUS SECOND TYPE, AND FRUSTRATE OR SLOW DOWN THE SLIGHTLY LESS DETERMINED, RUTHLESS, POLITICALLY ASTUTE, OR PUBLICLY SUPPORTED STRUCTURAL POPULIST.
581	AFTER THE ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), CHINA ENCOUNTERED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES WITH OTHER MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES (SCM). AMONG ALL THE COUNTERVAILING INVESTIGATIONS TOWARDS CHINA, THE MAIN COMPLAINTS WERE CHINESE TAX INCENTIVES SUCH AS SPECIFIC TAX REDUCTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS, OR TAX PREFERENCES RELATED TO EXPORT OR IMPORT. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE GENERAL SITUATION OF CHINESE DIRECT TAX INCENTIVES, AND THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH SUBSIDY RULES IN THE WTO. FURTHER, IT ATTEMPTS TO FIND OUT TENSIONS BETWEEN THE CHINESE DIRECT TAX INCENTIVES AND THE WTO'S SUBSIDY RULES, AND THE MAIN REASONS BEHIND THE TENSIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHINA TO ALLEVIATE THE TENSIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT OFFERS FURTHER PROSPECT FOR THE WTO WITH RESPECT TO ITS SUBSIDY RULES AND ITS ROLE IN REGULATING TAXATION. THIS ARTICLE FINDS OUT THAT THERE ARE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE CHINESE TAX INCENTIVES AND THE WTO'S SYSTEM. CHINA HAS A STATE-ORIENTED ATTITUDE TOWARDS TAX INCENTIVES, AND THERE IS A LACK OF INTERNAL LEGAL CONTROL OVER THE GRANTING OF THEM. THEREFORE, CHINESE TAX INCENTIVES CAN EASILY CAUSE TENSIONS WITH THE WTO'S SUBSIDY RULES. MOREOVER, THE TENSIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE DIFFERENCES OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MARKET, AND THE DIFFERENCES ON THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA AND THE WTO SYSTEM. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS A COMMON PLATFORM BASED ON THE COMMON OBJECTS AND PURPOSES OF CHINESE TAX SYSTEMS AND THE WTO TO ALLEVIATE TENSIONS.
582	THE EMERGENCE OF ERITREA AS A NEW NATION APPARENTLY REQUIRED THE GOVERNMENT TO TRANSCEND INHERITED FORMS OF IDENTITY. IT HAS TRIED TO DO THIS BY FORGING A NEW POLITICAL CULTURE OUT OF COLLECTIVE MEMORIES OF WAR, BUT THIS ATTEMPT WAS ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL. LARGELY STEEPED IN POLITICAL SYMBOLISM AND POPULIST RHETORIC OF SACRIFICE AND SELF-RELIANCE, THE REGIME'S ATTEMPT TO SOCIALISE THE ERITREAN SOCIETY WITH VALORISED REVOLUTIONARY VALUES IS DESIGNED TO CAMOUFLAGE THE POLITICAL REALITY OF REPRESSION. BY TAKING THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL CULTURE AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ERITREA'S DOUBLE TRAGEDY HAS TWO MAJOR CAUSES. FIRSTLY, IT EMANATES FROM THE SURREAL, TIGHTLY CONTROLLED PERSONAL RULE OF ISAIAS AFEWORKI WHO, IN THE FACE OF DECLINING LEGITIMACY AND A TENUOUS GRIP ON POWER, HAS RAISED THE LEVEL OF REPRESSION TO NEW HEIGHTS. SECONDLY, IT HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THE CHASM IN POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS AND BELIEF SYSTEMS BETWEEN THE BODY POLITIC AND SOCIETY, RESULTING IN A CULTURE OF ANOMIE WHICH EXPRESSES ITSELF IN MISTRUST, IMPUNITY, ACQUIESCENCE AND FATALISM. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A VIABLE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK OF STATE-BUILDING IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN TWO CONDITIONS ARE MET. IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS NECESSARY THAT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS EVOLVE WITHIN A POLITICAL STRUCTURE THAT IS ROOTED IN A RULE OF LAW THAT PROMOTES THE LEGITIMACY OF INCUMBENTS AND POLICY GOVERNANCE. IN ADDITION, THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK MUST FACILITATE THE PROMOTION OF CIVIL SOCIETY AS A POLITICAL SPACE FOR POLITICAL EDUCATION IN ORDER TO FOSTER THE STABLE REPRODUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF TOLERANCE AND COEXISTENCE.
583	THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE. PRESIDENTS DENOUNCE THE CONSTANT FLOW OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA FROM UNAUTHORIZED, ANONYMOUS SOURCES. NATIONAL SECURITY PROFESSIONALS DECRY THE CONSEQUENCES. AND YET THE LAWS AGAINST LEAKING ARE ALMOST NEVER ENFORCED. THROUGHOUT U.S. HISTORY, ROUGHLY A DOZEN CRIMINAL CASES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST SUSPECTED LEAKERS. THERE IS A DRAMATIC DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE WAY OUR LAWS AND OUR LEADERS CONDEMN LEAKING IN THE ABSTRACT AND THE WAY THEY CONDONE IT IN PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE STANDARD ACCOUNT OF THAT DISCONNECT, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE DIFFICULTIES OF APPREHENDING AND PROSECUTING OFFENDERS, AND ADVANCES AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY OF LEAKING. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S "LEAKINESS" IS OFTEN TAKEN TO BE A SIGN OF ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES IT IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS AN ADAPTIVE RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL LIABILITIES (SUCH AS THE MISTRUST GENERATED BY PRESIDENTIAL SECRET KEEPING AND MEDIA MANIPULATION) AND INTERNAL PATHOLOGIES (SUCH AS OVERCLASSIFICATION AND BUREAUCRATIC FRAGMENTATION) OF THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THE LEAK LAWS ARE SO RARELY ENFORCED NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO PUNISH VIOLATORS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE KEY INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS SHARE OVERLAPPING INTERESTS IN MAINTAINING A PERMISSIVE CULTURE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION DISCLOSURES. PERMISSIVENESS DOES NOT ENTAIL ANARCHY, HOWEVER, AS A NUANCED SYSTEM OF INFORMAL SOCIAL CONTROLS HAS COME TO SUPPLEMENT, AND ALL BUT SUPPLANT, THE FORMAL DISCIPLINARY SCHEME. IN DETAILING THESE CLAIMS, THE ARTICLE MAPS THE RICH SOCIOLOGY OF GOVERNMENTAL LEAK REGULATION AND EXPLORES A RANGE OF IMPLICATIONS FOR EXECUTIVE POWER, NATIONAL SECURITY, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
584	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE CRUCIAL TO DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION, AND THAT AN IMBALANCE IN THE POWER CONFIGURATION BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY IMPEDES DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. AFTER DEMOCRACY WAS INTRODUCED, CAMBODIAN ELITES CONTINUED TO EMPLOY PATRONAGE AND CORRUPTION TO ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS AND STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITIONS THROUGH THE PROVISION OF BENEFITS TO MEMBERS OF THEIR PATRONAGE NETWORKS. THESE NETWORKS EXTENDED THROUGHOUT AND CROSSCUT FORMAL POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THE EMBEDDEDNESS OF THESE ELEMENTS IN CAMBODIAN POLITICS PREVENTS DEMOCRACY FROM CONSOLIDATING, BECAUSE CONSOLIDATION REQUIRES BOTH THE ESTABLISHMENT AND STRENGTHENING OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS. FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF DEMOCRACY IN 1993, THERE HAVE BEEN NEW ELEMENTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, INCLUDING MOST IMPORTANTLY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, ATTEMPTING TO TRANSFORM THE IMBALANCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. HOWEVER, THEIR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN AN UPHILL STRUGGLE, GIVEN THE UNEQUAL POWER CONFIGURATION BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. THE STATE APPEARS TO BE STRONG IN THAT IT CAN SILENCE AND OPPRESS GOVERNMENT OPPONENTS; HOWEVER, THE STATE APPARATUS IS APPARENTLY WEAK IN PROVIDING SERVICES AND ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE MEANTIME, CIVIL SOCIETY HAS NOT ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO PRESSURE THE STATE TO ADOPT MEANINGFUL REFORM DUE TO ITS EXOGENOUS AND ENDOGENOUS WEAKNESSES. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE SOBER REALITY IS THAT CIVIL SOCIETY CANNOT REALLY CONTRIBUTE SUBSTANTIALLY TO DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION UNTIL CAMBODIA HAS A LARGER URBAN, EDUCATED POPULATION, A LARGER MIDDLE CLASS, AND MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE IDEA OF NON-POLITICAL "SECONDARY ASSOCIATIONS," WHICH CAN BUILD UP "SOCIAL TRUST" AND GENERATE "NORMS OF RECIPROCITY" THAT DEVIATE FROM STANDARD PATRONAGE NETWORKS.
585	THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION IN HUNGARY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A MARKET ECONOMY. THE PROCESS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A SERIES OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. TIRE PAPER FIRST REVIEWS THE SOCIAL POLICY, ORIENTATION OF THE THREE FREE CONSECUTIVE GOVERNMENTS ELECTED SINCE THE TRANSITION. NONE OF THEM HAS HAD A CLEAR POLITICAL PROFILE: THEY, HAVE CONSTITUTED MIXED AND UNCLEAR WELFARE REGIMES. NONE OF THEN HAS SKETCHED A CLEAR WELFARE POLICY EXCEPT PERHAPS THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. IN ITS CASE CENTRAL REDISTRIBUTION IS CONSISTENTLY BIASED IN FAVOUR OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER STRATA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE POOR. INSTEAD OF A CONSENSUAL PLAN DEFINING PRIORITIES, DECISIONS AND REFORMS IN THE LAST LENT YEARS HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED BY POLITICAL INTERESTS, AT HOC IDEAS, AND AUTHORITARIAN RULINGS. THE PAPER NEXT SHOWS WHAT REFORM MEANT IN THE CASE OF THE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS AND VARIOUS FOLDS OF SOCIAL POLICY, NAME, UNEMPLOYMENT, HEALTH, PENSIONS, FAMILY BENEFITS AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHILE BOTH THE INHERITED AND THE NEWLY CREATED SYSTEMS HAD CONTRIBUTED TO ALLEVIATE THE SHOCKS OF THE TRANSITION, YET THERE NEVER WAS ENOUGH POLITICAL MILL TO GIVE SUFFICIENT OR ADEQUATE HELP TO THOSE NEEDING IT. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE "REFORMS" PUBLIC EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THE WELFARE GAP BETWEEN EAST AND WEST HAS THEREBY GROWN. THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS BECOME GRAVEL, DIVIDED, AND THAT POVERTY IS GREATER AND DEEPER THAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF POLICIES.
586	IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE SYSTEM OF INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) NOW FACES SOMETHING OF A 'LEGITIMACY CRISIS'. STATES COMPLAIN OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE AN UNJUSTIFIED ENCROACHMENT INTO THEIR REGULATORY SPACE. INVESTORS BEMOAN THE FRAGMENTATION OF INVESTMENT LAW. AND THE PUBLIC RESENTS THE FACT THAT AN ANONYMOUS PANEL OF LAWYERS SITTING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ARE MAKING DECISIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR WELL-BEING AND LIVELIHOODS THROUGH A PROCESS IN WHICH THEY ARE NEITHER SEEN NOR HEARD. THESE CRITICISMS OF ISDS RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROCEDURAL DESIGN OF THE ISDS SYSTEM AND HOW THIS MIGHT BE AFFECTING PERCEPTIONS OF ISDS'S LEGITIMACY AS A MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT ISDS'S LEGITIMACY CRISIS CAN BE TRACED, AT LEAST IN PART, TO ITS FAILURE TO UPHOLD CERTAIN CORE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW - IN PARTICULAR, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSISTENCY - WHICH ARE OF ESPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE ISDS CONTEXT. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE REASON WHY INVESTMENT ARBITRATION STRUGGLES TO UPHOLD THESE VALUES LIES IN THE DISSONANCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC FACE OF ISDS - MEANING THE PUBLIC NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES - AND ITS PRIVATE FACE - MEANING THE PRIVATE ARBITRAL PROCESS BY WHICH INVESTMENT DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED. EFFORTS AT REFORM SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT RESOLVING THAT DISSONANCE, AND WHILST THERE IS MUCH TO COMMEND AN INCREMENTAL REFORM OF THE SYSTEM OF ARBITRATION, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE AN INTERIM STEP ON THE PATH TO DEEPER PROCESS REFORM.
587	THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. AMONG THE SYSTEMS OF INSTITUTIONAL, ORGANISATIONAL, AND SUBSTANTIVE GUARANTEES FOR ENSURING THIS RIGHT, WHICH STEM FROM THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASE LAW, THERE IS A FAIR AND PUBLIC HEARING BY AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW. THIS REQUIREMENT IS ORGANICALLY LINKED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, WHICH IS A CENTRAL TENET OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND PROVIDES FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIARY AS A SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF POWER. THEREFORE, ANY CHANGES IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATES, OR, MOREOVER, JUDICIAL REFORMS, SHOULD NOT ONLY AVOID CONTRADICTING THESE PRINCIPLES BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, SHOULD BE AIMED AT ENSURING THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. HOWEVER, THE EXPERIENCE OF SUCH REFORMS IN A NUMBER OF EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, DESPITE THE DECLARATION OF THEIR PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND POSITIVE GOALS, RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR TRUE DIRECTION. AS A RESULT, NOT ONLY DOES THE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (WHICH IS THE IMMEDIATE GOAL OF PROCLAIMING THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL) SUFFER, BUT ALSO THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS OF THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED BECOME UNBALANCED AND UNABLE TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO POLITICAL CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ESSENCE OF JUDICIAL REFORMS IN A NUMBER OF EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (SERBIA, NORTHERN MACEDONIA, POLAND, HUNGARY, ROMANIA, MOLDOVA, AND UKRAINE) AND ANALYSES THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPACT ON ENSURING THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND THE FUNCTIONING OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS
588	THE PAPER STUDIES THE LEGAL ENFORCED EMERGENCE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC TITLE OF COMPULSORY ORIGIN TO LAND PLOTS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL FOR THE EUROPEAN LEGAL PRACTICE. THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF ITS APPEARANCE AND NOTE THAT THIS IS DUE TO THE NATIONAL SPECIFICS OF RUSSIA'S TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY AND A RULE-OF-LAW STATE. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES LEGAL PROCEDURES FOR THE FORCED REISSUANCE OF THE RIGHT OF PERMANENT (UNLIMITED) PROPERTY USE, THE EMERGENCE OF THE RIGHT OF COMMON SHARE OWNERSHIP OF CITIZENS WHO ARE THE OWNERS OF A PREMISES (APARTMENTS) IN MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, THE FORCED TRANSFER TO PUBLIC PROPERTY OF HEIRLESS ESTATE, REDISTRIBUTION OF LANDED PROPERTY AMONG DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY, TRANSFER OF A LAND LOT WHICH CANNOT BY LAW BELONG TO A CITIZEN OR A LEGAL ENTITY TO PUBLIC PROPERTY, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHERS ISSUES. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THE LEGAL PRACTICE OF THE COMPULSORY EMERGENCY OF THE RIGHT TO OWN LAND PLOTS IS IN MANY RESPECTS A NECESSARY CONDI-TION FOR SECURING IMPORTANT PUBLIC INTERESTS WHICH IS INADMISSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN OWNERLESS ESTATE WHERE CONDITION MAY THREATEN LIFE, HEALTH AND OTHER LEGALLY PROTECTED GOODS, THE INVASION OF LAND IN CIVIL CIRCULATION, ATTRACTION OF ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO THE FEDERAL, REGIONAL AND MUNICIPAL BUDGETS THROUGH THE COLLECTION OF LAND TAX (OR RENT PAYMENT IN THE CASE OF FORCING THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY TO INCLUDE A JOINT LEASEHOLD AGREEMENT).
589	THIS PAPER IS THE THIRD FROM THE "SALON SERIES ON THE CREATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS". THIS WAS A SERIES OF SALONS JOINTLY HOSTED BY TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY'S NGO RESEARCH CENTER, THE PHILANTHROPY AND NGO SUPPORT CENTER, AND THE EDITORIAL OFFICE OF THE CHINA NONPROFIT REVIEW. DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CREATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION BEGAN IN CHINA DURING THE 1980S, AT WHICH TIME A BILL WAS DRAWN UP, BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS, BOTH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL, THE BILL WAS NEVER PASSED. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION AND THE FEASIBILITY AND NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING LEGISLATION ON THIS RIGHT IN THE CHINA OF TODAY. IT PONDERS THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION MAY BE ENSHRINED IN LAW, LOOKING AT THE SCATTERING OF LEGAL PROVISIONS THROUGHOUT NUMEROUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION (IN A MULTI-LEGISLATIVE MODEL) IN CONTRAST WITH THE METHOD OF SPELLING OUT OF THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION IN ONE OR MORE CENTRALIZED LAWS (IN A CENTRALIZED LEGISLATIVE MODEL). THE PAPER ALSO EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FORMULATION OF A BASIC LAW FOR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND LEGISLATING ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION. IT WAS UNANIMOUS AMONGST THE EXPERTS SPEAKING AT THE SALON UPON WHICH THIS PAPER IS BASED THAT ESTABLISHING A LAW ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT HALLMARK OF CHINA'S PROCESS IN DEVELOPING STRONGER RULE OF LAW, AND THAT IT IS A SINE QUA NON FOR ACHIEVING CONSTITUTIONALISM AND ADVANCING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.
590	ARTICLE 24 PARAGRAPH (1) OF THE NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES, ESTABLISHED BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN BEIS AND ASSOCIATIONS OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN THE REGION. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAP OUT AND INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BEFORE THE ENACTMENT OF LAW NO. 40 OF 2004 ON NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY, AS AN INPUT OF POLICY MAKING, IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS, PUBLIC POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES OF PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM IN ACCORDANCE ARTICLE 19 LAW OF NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY COMMISSION. DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW AND DOCUMENT DEPTH AND EXTENSIVE WITH QUALITATIVE METHODS. SAMPLES WERE: RELATED UNITS IN MINISTRIES, PROVINCIAL/DISTRICT/CITY HEALTH OFFICE IN JAKARTA AND CENTRAL JAVA, ASSOCIATIONS OF HEALTH FACILITIES AT NATIONAL LEVEL AND REGIONAL LOCATED IN JAKARTA AND CENTRAL JAVA, HEALTH SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERTS, INDONESIA ARMY AND POLICE OF HEALTH DIRECTORATE AT HEADQUARTER. ONLY A FEW ASSOCIATIONS OF HEALTH FACILITIES EXISTING RECOGNIZED BY THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ESTABLISHED OF ASSOCIATION DEFINE BY REGULATION AT LEVEL DECREE WHICH ADOPTED WITH LETTERS BY ALL TYPE LEADERSHIP, ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS AND NOTARIES. THEIR MEMBERSHIP MULTIPLE, NEARLY ALL ASSOCIATIONS GATHERED IN OTHER ASSOCIATIONS, THUS A HOSPITAL CAN BE ASSEMBLED IN MANY DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS. THE EXISTING ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES DOES NOT PLAY A ROLE IN DETERMINING CONTENT AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CONTRACT WITH BPJS, IN CONTRARY THE FACILITIES PLAYED DIRECTLY. NECESSARY THE RULE OF LAW FOR ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS MEMBERS A LOCAL TECHNICAL UNIT AREA CAN ALSO BOUND BY CONTRACT WITH BPJS.
591	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO FILL TWO GAPS IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP LITERATURE IDENTIFIED BY DIETZ AND HAURIN: HOMEOWNERSHIP IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND THE EFFECTS OF RACE, ETHNICITY AND INCOME ON TENURE CHOICE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - UNITED NATIONS DATA FROM 1993 AND 1998 ARE USED TO OFFER A CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS OF THE DETERMINANTS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES. CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE, THIS STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE PRICE-TO-RENT RATIO IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN TENURE CHOICE AND INCREASES IN INCOME ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CONSUMERS WHO CHOOSE TO OWN. HOWEVER, THESE RELATIONSHIPS SEEM TO HOLD GENERALLY ONLY FOR HIGHER INCOME DEVELOPED COUNTRIES FINDINGS - IN CONTRAST TO THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE THAT FINDS RACE AND ETHNICITY ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCES IN US HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES, THIS STUDY FINDS NO EVIDENCE THAT THESE DETERMINANTS ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES ACROSS COUNTRIES. THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE THE RULE OF LAW AND FIND IT IS CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH INCOME MEASURES WHICH MAY INDICATE THAT COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER LAWS ENCOURAGE HIGHER HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES. FINALLY, CAPITALIST/(FORMERLY)COMMUNIST REGIME DIFFERENCES DO NOT APPEAR TO EXPLAIN CROSS COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THIS RESEARCH IS LIMITED BY THE SCOPE AND QUALITY OF THE UN DATA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER OFFERS INSIGHTS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF SELECTED POLICIES TO INCREASE DOMESTIC HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES AND IDENTIFIES SEVERAL AVENUES FOR FUTURE INTERNATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP RESEARCH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN INITIAL EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON INTERNATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP IN AN ATTEMPT TO FILL GAPS IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP LITERATURE.
592	OUTSHOPPING WITHIN A COUNTRY'S BOUNDARIES AND INTERNATIONAL OUTSHOPPING ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS HAS BEEN LONG RESEARCHED. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATE (OUTER) MOTIVES AS THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR OUTSHOPPING. BUILDING ON THIS TRADITION, WE CATEGORIZED IMMEDIATE MOTIVES FOR OUTSHOPPING INTO THE FOLLOWING FOUR GROUPS: (1) PRODUCT QUALITY, (2) SERVICE QUALITY, (3) FASHION CONSCIOUSNESS, AND (4) SHOPPING ENJOYMENT. OUR RESULTS CONFIRMED PREVIOUS FINDINGS THAT THOSE FOUR MOTIVES ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO OUTSHOPPING FREQUENCY. A POINT OF DEPARTURE FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH, HOWEVER, IS THAT BASED ON HOFSTEDE'S WORKS [1980. CULTURE'S CONSEQUENCES: INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN WORK-RELATED VALUES. SAGE PUBLICATIONS, NEWBURY PARK, CA; 2001. COMPARING VALUES, BEHAVIORS, INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS NATIONS, SECOND ED. SAGE PUBLICATIONS, THOUSAND OAKS, CA] WE IDENTIFIED FOUR INNER MOTIVES: (1) DESIRE FOR SHOWING OFF POWER, (2) DESIRE FOR RULE OF LAW, (3) EGOISM, AND (4) MASCULINITY. THROUGH STRUCTURE MODELING TECHNIQUE, THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS THAT EXIST AT A HIGHER LEVEL NOT ONLY INFLUENCE THE OUTER MOTIVES, BUT ALSO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUTSHOPPING FREQUENCY. IN OTHER WORDS, CROSS-BORDER SHOPPING CAN FULFILL SHOPPERS' OBVIOUS SECULAR NEEDS EXISTING AT A LOW LEVEL, AS WELL AS THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS HIDDEN AT A HIGHER LEVEL. ALTHOUGH OUR STUDY EXAMINED WHY MEXICAN NATIONALS CHOOSE TO SHOP IN THE US, THE RESULTS ARE APPLICABLE TO OUTSHOPPING IN GENERAL WHERE SHOPPING ENVIRONMENTS DIFFER IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. MANAGERIAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. (C) 2005 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
593	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CONTOURS OF A "DIALOGICAL MODEL" OF ADJUDICATION ARISING FROM THE PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT IS PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMING INHERITED NOTIONS OF RIGHTS, LEGAL REASONING, LEGAL AUTHORITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW MORE GENERALLY. THE DIALOGICAL MODEL IS CHARACTERIZED BY A FORM OF REASONING THAT IS NOT SELF-RELIANT OR AUTONOMOUS, BUT INTERNALLY CONSTITUTED BY THE INTERACTION OF MULTIPLE VOICES, NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVES, AND INSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINTS. WHAT IS DEFINED AS DIALOGICAL, HOWEVER, IS NOT THE INCLUSION OF THIS OR THAT DISCRETE VOICE, BUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ADJUDICATION, INCLUDING: HOW ISSUES ARE FRAMED; THE NEED TO CONSIDER CASES AS A WHOLE; THEIR EMBEDDEDNESS IN LARGE SWATHES OF NORMATIVE MAGMA; THE SELF-REFLEXIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE COURT'S POSITION AND TRAJECTORY; THE RELATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURT'S AUTHORITY; AND THE FACT THAT EACH AND EVERY DECISION CONSTITUTES A NOTION OF DEMOCRACY THAT IS PLURAL, MANY-VOICED, AND INHERENTLY IN TENSION. BEYOND A MERE POLYPHONY OF VOICES, THEREFORE, THIS IS AN ENTIRELY NEW PARADIGM TO CONCEIVE THE COURT'S TASK, WHICH DIFFERS MARKEDLY FROM THE TWO MAIN PARADIGMS OF UNDERSTANDING HUMAN RIGHTS ADJUDICATION, NAMELY THE RIGHTS-BASED MODEL AND PROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS. AFTER DESCRIBING THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE LATTER TWO PARADIGMS FULLY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COURT'S PRACTICE, THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE FEATURES OF THE DIALOGICAL MODEL. ULTIMATELY, THIS IS A JUDGMENT ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFINITION OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES, WHICH NECESSITATES A REASSESSMENT OF THE COUNTERMAJORITARIAN DIFFICULTY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEMOCRACY-CONSTITUTING ROLE OF THE COURT.
594	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO FURTHER STUDY THE PANEL REPORT IN RUSSIA - TRAFFIC IN TRANSIT REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF 1994 GENERAL AGREEMENTS ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT) ARTICLE XXI(B). IT ANALYSES THE THRESHOLD APPLIED BY THE PANEL IN APPLYING ARTICLE XXI(B)(III) AND FURTHER DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE DISPUTE. THIS STUDY ALSO INVESTIGATES THE NOTION OF EMERGENCY AND SECURITY INTEREST AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS NORMATIVE RESEARCH USES A QUALITATIVE LEGAL METHODOLOGY. THIS STUDY CONDUCTS DESK ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY LEGAL MATERIALS AND EXISTING LITERATURE TO ASSESS THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY INTEREST WITHIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) FRAMEWORK. FINDINGS THIS PAPER FINDS THAT THE PANEL IN RUSSIA - TRAFFIC IN TRANSIT APPLIED SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE TEST IN REVIEWING RUSSIA'S INVOCATION OF GATT ARTICLE XXI(B)(III). DESPITE THE ADJECTIVAL SELF-JUDGING CLAUSE AND THE POLITICAL TENSION OF THE DISPUTE, THE PANEL IS CAPABLE TO REVIEW ITS APPLICATION. THIS STUDY FURTHER FINDS THAT THE TERM SECURITY INTEREST AND EMERGENCY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS STILL LEAVES THE POSSIBILITY OF OPEN INTERPRETATION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF THE NORMATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH, THE RESEARCH RESULTS LACK EMPIRICAL DATA AND IMPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, FUTURE RESEARCH IS ENCOURAGED TO INQUIRE ON THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER FULFILS THE NEED TO STUDY AND EXPLORE SECURITY EXCEPTION CLAUSE WITHIN THE WTO FRAMEWORK AS A NORMATIVE RULE OF LAW AND IN THE WIDER CONCEPTUAL NOTION OF SECURITY AND EMERGENCY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW.
595	THE 1982 TURKISH CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHED A LEGAL SYSTEM AIMED AT ENSURING STATE EFFICIENCY AND STABILITY MORE THAN THE FULL RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LAST DECADE, THE LATTER IS UNDERGOING A DEMOCRATIC DECAY. THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT ISLAMIC POPULISM IS REINTERPRETING FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY TO ENTRENCH A PATERNALISTIC MAJORITARIAN VISION OF THE LAW-MAKING PROCESS AND OF THE SOCIETY. THIS PERSPECTIVE UNDERMINES THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER EQUALITY, CONFIRMING THE DENIAL OF LGBTQIA+ RIGHTS AND INCREASINGLY FAVOURING THE PRINCIPLE'S INTERPRETATION IN LINE WITH THE ISLAMIC CONCEPTION OF GENDER COMPLEMENTARITY. SUCH A LIMITATION IN WOMEN'S ENJOYMENT OF EQUALITY IS QUITE STRIKING FOR A COUNTRY THAT STARTED THE PROCESS OF WOMEN'S EMANCIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, COEVALLY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TURKISH REPUBLIC. FURTHERMORE, THIS DRIFT RAISES DOUBTS AS TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON 'EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN AND MEN', ESTABLISHED IN 2009 WITH THE DUTY OF ENSURING THE RESPECT FOR GENDER EQUALITY THROUGHOUT THE LAW-MAKING PROCESS. DOES IT EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE GENDER EQUALITY IN THE LEGISLATION OR IS IT A MERE REPUTATIONAL TOOL? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, AFTER HAVING INTRODUCED THE ILLIBERAL FEATURES OF THE CURRENT TURKISH REGIME, THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMMITTEE IS ASSESSED AGAINST THE EUROPEAN AND TURKISH STANDARDS ON THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION. FINALLY, CONCLUDING REMARKS COMPARE THE TURKISH CASE WITH OTHER ILLIBERAL AUTHORITARIANISMS' DISCOURSE ON GENDER EQUALITY, UNDERSCORING TO WHAT EXTENT THE TURKISH AUTHORITARIAN DRIFT ENTAILS AN ANTI-GENDER EVOLUTION IN LINE WITH THE CONSERVATIVE IDEOLOGICAL VISION OF SEVERAL OTHER POPULISMS.
596	WITH THE MERGER OF LAW AND EQUITY ALMOST COMPLETE, THE IDEA OF EQUITY AS A SPECIAL PART OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM OR A MODE OF DECISIONMAKING HAS FALLEN OUT OF VIEW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MUCH OF EQUITY IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS PERFORMING A VITAL FUNCTION. EQUITY AND RELATED PARTS OF THE LAW SOLVE COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN PROBLEMS-INCLUDING INTERDEPENDENT BEHAVIOR AND MISUSES OF LEGAL RULES BY OPPORTUNISTS-AND DO SO IN A CHARACTERISTIC FASHION: AS META-LAW. FROM UNCONSCIONABILITY TO INJUNCTIONS, EQUITY MAKES REFERENCE TO, SUPPLEMENTS, AND SOMETIMES OVERRIDES THE RESULT THAT LAW WOULD OTHERWISE PRODUCE, WHILE PRIMARY LAW OPERATES WITHOUT REFERENCE TO EQUITY. EQUITY OPERATES ON A DOMAIN OF FRAUD, ACCIDENT, AND MISTAKE, AND EMPLOYS TRIGGERS SUCH AS BAD FAITH AND DISPROPORTIONATE HARDSHIP TO TOGGLE INTO A "META"-MODE OF MORE OPEN-ENDED SCRUTINY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF HOW A HYBRID LAW, CONSISTING OF RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND GENERAL PRIMARY-LEVEL LAW AND RELATIVELY INTENSE AND DIRECTED SECOND-ORDER EQUITY CAN REGULATE BEHAVIOR BETTER THROUGH THESE SPECIALIZED MODES THAN WOULD HOMOGENEOUS LAW ALONE. THE ARTICLE TESTS THIS THEORY ON THE OSTENSIBLY MOST UNPROMISING ASPECTS OF EQUITY, THE TRADITIONAL EQUITABLE MAXIMS, AS WELL AS EQUITABLE FRAUD, DEFENSES, AND REMEDIES. EQUITY AS META-LAW SHEDS LIGHT ON HOW THE FUSION OF LAW AND EQUITY SPAWNED MULTIFACTOR BALANCING TESTS, POLARIZED INTERPRETATION, AND LED TO THE CONFUSION OF EQUITY WITH STANDARDS, DISCRETION, PURELY PUBLIC LAW, AND "MERE" REMEDIES. VIEWING EQUITY AS META-LAW ALSO IMPROVES ON THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN FORMALISM AND CONTEXTUALISM AND ULTIMATELY PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW.
597	SINCE BECOMING A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE COUNTRY FOR THE EU ACCESSION IN 2000 AND IN PARTICULAR AFTER BEING GRANTED CANDIDATE STATUS IN JUNE 2014, ALBANIA HAS TAKEN MANY POSITIVE STEPS TO MEET THE NECESSARY STANDARDS FOR ITS EU INTEGRATION, THROUGH AMONG OTHER THINGS, STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE HARMONIZATION OF ITS NATIONAL LEGISLATION WITH THE ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE. IN 2016, AS PART OF THE PRE-CONDITIONS FOR THE OPENING OF THE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY, THE ALBANIAN PARLIAMENT PASSED A MAJOR JUSTICE REFORM WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT MANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONING OF JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS IN ALBANIA. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE REFORM WAS THE TRANSITIONAL RE-EVALUATION OF JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS (ALSO KNOWN AS THE VETTING PROCESS). WHILE THE REFORM ITSELF WAS SUPPORTED AND PRAISED BY THE EU AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, THE VETTING PROCESS HAS AFFECTED THE FUNCTIONING OF THE ALBANIAN JUDICIARY AT ALL LEVELS. THE PARALYSIS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM DUE TO THE LOW NUMBER OF JUDGES WHO SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THE VETTING PROCESS, AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF MANY OTHERS, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE BACKLOG AND THE NUMBER OF PENDING CASES BEFORE THE COURTS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE JUSTICE REFORM ON INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME IN ALBANIA AND STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO GUARANTEE THIS RIGHT AS PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF ALBANIA AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS.
598	THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS AT MONITORING THE MEANINGS OF THE "HUMAN VALUES" AND THE "ETHICAL BEHAVIOR" IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION. IN A TIME OF COMPLEX RESEARCHES IN THE FIELD OF THE PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE, THE EU LEGAL DATABASE OF EUR-LEX PROVIDES VARIOUS CONCEPTIONS, MEANINGS AND USES OF BOTH TERMS. A REVIEWING OF THIS DOCUMENTATION WAS COMPLETED FRAMING THE EU STATED CRITERIA OF: (I) THE DOMAIN OF THE DOCUMENT (EU LAW AND RELATED DOCUMENTS, OFFICIAL JOURNAL, THE NATIONAL LAW, THE LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES); (II) THE SUBDOMAIN OF THE ACT (ALL DOCUMENTS, ALL EU LAW, PREPARATORY ACTS, LEGISLATION, CONSOLIDATED ACTS, PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS, INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, TREATIES); (III) THE YEAR OF THE DOCUMENT (FROM 2009 TO 2017) AND (IV) THE INSTITUTION (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT). THE STUDY SCRUTINIZES BOTH THE SOCIAL AND LEGAL ARGUMENTS USING THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE EU OFFICIAL RESOURCES PUBLISHED FROM 2009 TO 2017 AND IDENTIFIED VIA THE EU OFFICIAL ELECTRONIC DATABASE OF EUR-LEX. THE RESEARCH ALSO LEADS TO EXPLORING THE POST-MODERN TRENDS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BY DEFINING AND FRAMING THE TARGET CONCEPTS AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE "SOCIAL VALUES" AND "ETHICAL BEHAVIOR" IN THE EU LAW AND RELATED DOCUMENTS SUCH AS: (A) "HUMAN DIGNITY"; (B) "HUMAN RIGHTS"; (C) "FREEDOM"; (D) "DEMOCRACY"; (E) "EQUALITY"; (F) "RULE OF LAW"; (G) "SECURITY"; (H) "PRIVACY"; (I) "ETHICAL BEHAVIOR" ("ETHICS"); (J) "SOCIAL VALUES". THE RESEARCH THUS POSTULATES THE FRAMING OF THE "HUMAN VALUES" AND THE "ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR" CONSIDERING THREE REQUIREMENTS: (1) THE SOCIAL NEEDS; (2) THE LEGAL DEMANDS AND (3) THE INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE.
599	IS THE UNITED STATES AT RISK OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING? AND WOULD THE CONSTITUTION PREVENT SUCH DECAY? TO MANY, THE 2016 ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND THE CONDUCT OF NEWLY INSTALLED PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP MAY BE THE IMMEDIATE CATALYST FOR THESE QUESTIONS. BUT STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE SOCIOECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND GEOPOLITICAL SHIFTS ARE WHAT MAKE THE QUESTION A TRULY PRESSING ONE. ESCHEWING A FOCUS ON CURRENT EVENTS, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A TAXONOMY OF DIFFERENT THREATS OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING, THE MECHANISMS WHEREBY THEY UNFOLD, AND THE COMPARATIVE RISK OF EACH THREAT IN THE CONTEMPORARY MOMENT. BY DRAWING ON COMPARATIVE LAW AND POLITICS EXPERIENCE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE TWO MODAL PATHS OF DEMOCRATIC DECAY. WE CALL THESE AUTHORITARIAN REVERSION AND CONSTITUTIONAL RETROGRESSION. A REVERSION IS A RAPID AND NEAR-COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. RETROGRESSION IS A MORE SUBTLE, INCREMENTAL EROSION TO THREE INSTITUTIONAL PREDICATES OF DEMOCRACY OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY: COMPETITIVE ELECTIONS; RIGHTS OF POLITICAL SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION; AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND ADJUDICATIVE RULE OF LAW. WE SHOW THAT OVER THE PAST QUARTER-CENTURY, THE RISK OF REVERSION IN DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD HAS DECLINED, WHEREAS THE RISK OF RETROGRESSION HAS SPIKED. THE UNITED STATES IS NEITHER EXCEPTIONAL NOR IMMUNE FROM THESE CHANGES. WE EVALUATE THE DANGER OF RETROGRESSION AS CLEAR AND PRESENT HERE (AND ELSEWHERE), WHEREAS WE THINK REVERSION IS MUCH LESS LIKELY. WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS AGAINST RETROGRESSION ARE WEAK. THE NEAR TERM PROSPECTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERAL DEMOCRACY HENCE DEPEND LESS ON OUR INSTITUTIONS THAN ON THE QUALITIES OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, POPULAR RESISTANCE, AND THE QUIDDITIES OF PARTISAN COALITIONAL POLITICS.
600	IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF VARIABLES PUT MACEDONIA AT AN INCREASED RISK OF INSTABILITY. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE MACEDONIA'S TENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH GREECE, THE STRAIN POSED BY THE EUROPEAN MIGRATION CRISIS, THE POTENTIAL FOR DOMESTIC INTERETHNIC CONFLICT, AND MACEDONIA'S RECENT GOVERNMENT SCANDALS. BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY RISKS THAT AN UNSTABLE MACEDONIA POSES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION, IT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE EU TO SEEK NEW WAYS ENSURE MACEDONIA REMAINS STABLE. THIS NOTE ASSESSES THE CONTINUED DURABILITY OF THE CURRENT SET OF LEGAL TOOLS MOST IMPORTANTLY THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE 2001 OHRID FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT ("OHRID") TO COPE WITH THE INCREASED STRAIN POSED BY RECENT DESTABILIZING CRISES IN MACEDONIA. THE NOTE ARGUES THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY OHRID IS LARGELY EFFECTIVE BUT THAT THE EU NEEDS TO INCREASE THE PROCEDURAL IMPEDIMENTS TO FUTURE MACEDONIAN GOVERNMENTS ENACTING ILLIBERAL REFORM AFTER MACEDONIA BECOMES AN EU MEMBER. THIS NOTE CONTRIBUTES TO EXISTING DIALOGUE BY OFFERING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STEPS THAT BOTH MACEDONIAN AND EUROPEAN LEADERS CAN TAKE TO INCREASE MACEDONIA'S INTERNAL STABILITY: THROUGH CHANGES TO EXISTING DOMESTIC LEGAL REGIMES AND BY DEVELOPING STRONGER TIES BETWEEN MACEDONIA AND REGIONAL EUROPEAN LEGAL REGIMES. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF INSTABILITY GIVEN CURRENT GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, THERE IS REASON FOR CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM GIVEN THE COUNTRY'S STRONG BASELINE OF RULE OF LAW AND PROVEN DESIRE TO JOIN THE EU. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, EUROPEAN LEADERS MUST TAKE TACTICALLY PREEMPTIVE STEPS TO CREATE A CLEARER AND MORE CERTAIN PATH TO EU MEMBERSHIP FOR MACEDONIA.
601	MANUSCRIPT TYPE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS/ISSUE THIS STUDY EXAMINES VARIATION AMONG FIRMS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF HOW CORPORATE BOARDS ARE STRUCTURED FOR EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE. WE DISCUSS THE FIDUCIARY ROLE OF BOARDS ALONG TWO DIMENSIONS: (1) BOARDS AS WEALTH PROTECTORS AND (2) BOARDS AS WEALTH CREATORS. WE EXPLORE HOW EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS AFFECT THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON THESE TWO BOARD ROLE DIMENSIONS. RESEARCH FINDINGS/INSIGHTS USING DATA FROM 23 COUNTRIES AND 19 INDUSTRIES, WE SHOW THAT BOARD STRUCTURE CHOICES DEPEND UPON NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. SPECIFICALLY, INVESTOR PROTECTION, RULE OF LAW, AND OPEN MARKETS INSTITUTION ACT AS COMPLEMENTS OR SUBSTITUTES TO HOW A BOARD IS STRUCTURED TO EMPHASIZE TWO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. THE RESULTS HOLD WHILE CONTROLLING FOR FIRM, INDUSTRY, AND OTHER COUNTRY LEVEL EFFECTS. THEORETICAL/ACADEMIC IMPLICATIONS WE OFFER A MORE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINKAGES BETWEEN INTERNAL/FIRM AND EXTERNAL/INSTITUTION LEVEL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS BY STUDYING THEM IN TANDEM. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS WITHIN A NATION ALTER THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF DESIGNING BOARDS FOR A CERTAIN FIDUCIARY ROLE. THIS FINDING CONTRIBUTES TO THE GOVERNANCE BUNDLES LITERATURE BY ARTICULATING HOW GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS FROM BOTH FIRM AND NATION LEVELS CONFIGURE TOGETHER TO FORM NATIONAL GOVERNANCE BUNDLES. PRACTITIONER/POLICY IMPLICATION AS OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS DIFFER BY COUNTRY DUE TO DISTINCT INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, FIRMS VARYINGLY STRUCTURE THEIR BOARDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY EMPHASIZE STRONGER WEALTH PROTECTION AND/OR WEALTH CREATION, OR NEITHER. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO PUBLIC POLICY BY PRESENTING HOW CORPORATE LAWS AND DE/REGULATING MARKETS MAY AFFECT BOARD STRUCTURE CHOICES.
602	TWO MAJOR POLICE REFORMS WERE INTRODUCED IN SOUTH KOREA IN 1991 AND 1999 TO HELP BRING ABOUT A SHIFT FROM A COLONIAL STYLE OF POLICING TO A FORM MORE PREVALENT IN DEVELOPED ECONOMIES PURSUING THE RULE OF LAW, OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRATIC POLICING. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FINDINGS FROM THE PRESENT STUDY, DRAWING ON A SURVEY OF A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 406 SOUTH KOREAN POLICE OFFICERS, OFFER MODEST SUPPORT FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE GRAND REFORM IN ITS IMPACT ON POLICE OFFICERS' SATISFACTION WITH PROMOTION AND SALARY AND BENEFITS. WHILE FEW DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AGE AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH JOB SATISFACTION, THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND JOB SATISFACTION. MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND PERCEIVED CITIZEN SUPPORT OF POLICE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH MEASURES OF SATISFACTION, PROMOTION AND SALARY/BENEFITS, WHILE THE POLICE OFFICERS' RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR SUPERVISORS IS LESS THAN STELLAR. FINALLY, OFFICERS WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PRIMARY OPERATING PHILOSOPHY OF THE POLICE IS TO SERVE THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE SATISFIED WITH THEIR JOBS RELATIVE TO THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR PROMOTION, WHICH IS PERHAPS A MORE CRITICAL MEASURE FOR THEM THAN SALARY AND BENEFITS, REFLECTING THE PRESENCE OF A POLICE ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE THAT IS STILL ROOTED IN THE HISTORICAL MILITARY CULTURE OF KOREAN POLICE. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT MORE EFFORTS ARE WARRANTED IN IMPROVING ORGANIZATIONAL CLIMATE IF OFFICERS ARE TO BELIEVE THEIR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO SERVE THE CITIZEN, A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC POLICING.
603	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE EMERGED AMONG OTHER VARIABLES TOUTED TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL RESULTS HAVE BEEN CONFLICTING. WITH A RELATIVELY POORER STATE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND A LOWER LEVEL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AMIDST RISING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS IN AFRICA, THE STUDY ASSESSES: A) THE DIRECT EFFECT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON CO2 EMISSIONS IN AFRICA; AND B) THE MODERATION ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE EFFECT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ON CO2 EMISSIONS IN AFRICA. THE STUDY RELIES ON PANEL DATA COVERING 2002-2021 FOR 32 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE FULLY-MODIFIED OLS REGRESSION METHOD IS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE DATA BASED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) HYPOTHESIS AND STOCHASTIC IMPACTS BY REGRESSION ON POPULATION, AFFLUENCE, & TECHNOLOGY (STIRPAT) MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT URBANIZATION AND TRADE OPENNESS INCREASE CO2 EMISSIONS. ALTHOUGH INCOME HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON CARBON EMISSIONS, THE SQUARE TERM HAS A NEGATIVE CONFIRMING THE EKC HYPOTHESIS. RENEWABLE ENERGY ALSO REDUCES CO2 EMISSIONS. INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND INSTITUTIONAL INDEX CREATED FROM THE ABOVE INDICATORS REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS. IN ADDITION, EXCEPT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE REMAINING INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY NEGATIVELY MODERATE THE EFFECT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ON CO2 EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS AMONG OTHER THINGS IMPLY THAT INTENSIFYING THE DEVELOPMENT AND USAGE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WOULD HELP ADDRESS THE RISING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS TREND IN AFRICA. ALSO, STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONS PROMISES TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS.
604	BRAZILIAN LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR RIGHTS FOR CANCER PATIENTS IN ORDER TO ASSIST WITH THEIR TREATMENT AND MITIGATE THE EXPENSES THEY FACE DURING THEIR ILLNESS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CALCULATE THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT AT A BRAZILIAN UNIFIED NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM (SUS) REFERRAL CENTER WHO REPORTED BEING AWARE OF 15 SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, ACCORDING TO THE POPULATION SUBGROUP ELIGIBLE TO REQUEST EACH RIGHT. ALL ADULT CANCER PATIENTS STARTING TREATMENT AT THE JUIZ DE FORA WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION FOR PREVENTING AND FIGHTING CANCER HOSPITAL (ASCOMCER), MINAS GERAIS STATE, FROM MARCH TO JULY 2022, WERE INTERVIEWED (N = 62). ABOUT 60% OF THESE PATIENTS HAD INCOMPLETE PRIMARY EDUCATION OR WERE ILLITERATE, AROUND 75% LIVED IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH A PER CAPITA INCOME BELOW ONE MINIMUM WAGE, AND 91.9% RECEIVED TREATMENT FROM THE SUS. FOR NINE OF THE 15 SELECTED RIGHTS, THE PROPORTION OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WAS HIGHER THAN 10%, RANGING FROM 17.7% FOR "WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SEVERANCE PAY FUND (FGTS)" TO 100% FOR "PRIORITY IN THE PROCESSING OF PROCEDURES". HOWEVER, THE ONLY ONE OF THESE RIGHTS KNOWN TO AT LEAST 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WAS "SICKNESS BENEFIT" (70.6%). THE RESPECTIVE PROPORTIONS WERE BELOW 5% IN THREE RIGHTS, INCLUDING "EXEMPTION FROM PROPERTY TAX," "EXEMPTION FROM INCOME TAX ON RETIREMENT, PENSION, AND RETIREMENT," AND "PRIORITY IN THE PROCESSING OF CASES". CANCER PATIENTS NEED TO HAVE THEIR COMPREHENSIVE CARE STRENGTHENED. THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL TO ENHANCE THE AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE BENEFITS CANCER PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FROM A DEMOCRATIC STATE THAT RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW.
605	THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THE PRACTICE OF INTERCULTURALITY IN PERUVIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN CONTEXTS OF NATIVE COMMUNITIES, SUCH AS QUECHUAS, AYMARAS, SHIPIBOS, AND OTHERS, IN TIMES OF COVID-19. IN WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF NATIVE CULTURES IDENTIFY WITH A STATE THAT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THEM, THEY FEEL ABANDONED BECAUSE THE HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES THEY RECEIVE FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE ONLY IN SPANISH DUE TO A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF NATIVE LANGUAGES BY CARE STAFF. CONSIDERING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MENDEZ REYES (2021) AND FINOL ROMERO (2021), INTERCULTURAL CONTEXTS DEMAND THE PRACTICE OF DECOLONIAL THINKING THAT EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATES THE CULTURE, POLITICS, AND VALUES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES; LIKEWISE, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF QUALITY OF SERVICE IN AN OPEN GOVERNMENT MODEL. THE METHOD USED WAS THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ACCORDING TO THE SUGGESTED PROCEDURES OF THE PRISMA MODEL. 130 RESEARCH ARTICLES-DOCUMENTS AND THE SELECTION OF 70 ARTICLES-DOCUMENTS WERE CONSULTED BASED ON THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA OF PRISMA METHOD TO SUPPORT THE REFLECTIVE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SUBJECT THROUGH FOUNDATIONS, COMPARISONS, AND CONTEXTUALIZATIONS IN DIFFERENT SPACES OF PERU, FRAMED IN A RULE OF LAW WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE THE PURPOSE OF SOLVING THE NATIONAL PROBLEM. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT INTERCULTURALITY IS ENDORSED BY LAWS, DIRECTIVES, AND MUNICIPAL ORDINANCES; HOWEVER, TO DATE THE REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED IN THE CONTEXTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THE MOST RELEVANT CONCLUSION IS THAT THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN PERU DOES NOT APPLY THE CURRENT INTERCULTURAL REGULATIONS IN TIMES OF COVID-19 AND THE NATIVE POPULATION DEMANDS PUBLIC POLICIES THAT INCLUDE BILINGUAL SERVICES IN A MULTICULTURAL-MULTILINGUAL PERU.
606	FINANCIAL INCLUSION IS CRITICAL TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH, PROFFERING POLICY SOLUTIONS TO ERADICATE THE BARRIERS THAT EXCLUDE INDIVIDUALS FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF PANELS CLASSIFIED BY INCOME AND REGIONAL LEVELS FROM 2002-2020. THE ANALYSIS BEGINS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE COMPOSITE FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX COMPRISED OF PENETRATION, AVAILABILITY, AND USAGE OF FINANCIAL SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATION OF HETEROGENEOUS PANEL DATA MODELS AUGMENTED WITH WELL-KNOWN VARIABLES. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE PANEL COINTEGRATION TEST SUPPORT A LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH, FINANCIAL INCLUSION, AND THE CONTROL VARIABLES IN THE FULL PANEL, INCOME-LEVEL, AND REGIONAL-LEVEL ECONOMIES. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY EMPLOYS A GMM (GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT) APPROACH USING SYSTEM-GMM ESTIMATORS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND THE CONTROL PREDICTORS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESULTS OF THE GMM MODEL CLEARLY INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION HAS A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS ALL PANELS, IMPLYING THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN FOSTERING RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE WORLD. FINALLY, THE STUDY DELVES INTO THE CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PREDICTORS AND PROVIDES STATISTICAL EVIDENCE OF BIDIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION, WHEREAS IT ONLY SUPPORTS UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIPS FROM CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, INFLATION RATE, THE RULE OF LAW, SCHOOL ENROLLMENT RATIO, AND TRADE OPENNESS WITH NO FEEDBACK CAUSALITY. MOREOVER, THE STUDY FAILS TO PROVIDE CAUSALITY EVIDENCE FROM THE AGE DEPENDENCY RATIO AND POPULATION TO ECONOMIC GROWTH.
607	THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO ACHIEVE THE STATED OBJECTIVE, THE STUDY EMPLOYED BALANCED DATA OF 43 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES DURING THE YEAR 2002 TO 2018. TO ANALYZE THE DATA, THE STUDY USED BOTH THE FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECT ESTIMATION APPROACHES AND EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND THREE PILLARS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE STUDY ALSO APPLIED THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO CREATE INDEXES FOR THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE TAKING THE SIX WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THE OVERALL FINDINGS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND OVERALL GOVERNANCE COMPOSITE INDEX HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OVERALL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION IS INFLUENCED SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY BY POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND OVERALL GOVERNANCE. IN ADDITION, THE ECONOMIC DIMENSION OF GOVERNANCE HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. FURTHERMORE, TRADE OPENNESS, REAL INTEREST RATE, INFLATION, REAL GDP, AND ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY ARE ALL MAJOR MACROECONOMIC PREDICTORS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY. AS A RESULT, ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY IN THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES MUST BE IMPROVED. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY POLICIES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION CONTROL, AND OVERALL MACROECONOMIC REFORM.
608	CONSERVATION CRIME IS A GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED SOCIETAL PROBLEM. CONSERVATION CRIME SCIENCE, AN EMERGING INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, ITS UTILITY DEPENDS ON SERIOUS REFLECTION ON THE TRANSPOSITION OF CRIME SCIENCE APPROACHES TO CONSERVATION CONTEXTS, WHICH MAY DIFFER IN MEANINGFUL WAYS FROM TRADITIONAL CRIME CONTEXTS. WE CONSIDERED THE BREADTH OF CRIME SCIENCE APPROACHES BEING USED IN CONSERVATION AS WELL AS THE DEPTH OF CRIME SCIENCE INTEGRATION IN CONSERVATION. WE USED THE CASE OF SEA CUCUMBER (HOLOTHURIA FLORIDANA, ISOSTICHOPUS BADIONOTUS) TRAFFICKING IN MEXICO AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY THE INTERDISCIPLINARITY OF CRIME AND CONSERVATION SCIENCES SHOULD BE DEEPENED AND HOW INTEGRATION CAN HELP IDEATE NEW SOLUTIONS. WE FIRST CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF LITERATURE TO CAPTURE THE RANGE OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY APPLICATIONS. WE IDENTIFIED 6 CRIME SCIENCE APPROACHES BEING APPLIED TO THE CONSERVATION CONTEXTS OF ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED FISHING; WILDLIFE AND PLANT CRIME; AND ILLEGAL LOGGING. WE THEN COMPARED THIS KNOWLEDGE BASE TO THE CASE OF ILLEGAL SEA CUCUMBER FISHING IN MEXICO. WE IDENTIFIED 5 CHALLENGES IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE APPROACHES TO CONSERVATION CONTEXTS: THE RELATIVE DIFFUSION OF HARMS AND VICTIMS IN CONSERVATION CRIMES; SCALAR MISMATCHES IN CRIME, AUTHORITY, AND THE CONSERVATION ISSUE ITSELF; INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LEGAL AND ILLEGAL NETWORKS; COMMUNITIES AND THEIR AUTHORITY TO DEFINE AND CONTROL CRIME; AND THE ROLE OF NATURAL SCIENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW. CONSIDERING THESE 5 FACTORS MAY ENHANCE THE DEPTH OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY BETWEEN CRIME AND CONSERVATION SCIENCES. NURTURING INTERDISCIPLINARY CRIME AND CONSERVATION SCIENCE WILL EXPAND INNOVATION AND HELP ACCELERATE SUCCESSFUL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHER POLICY AGENDAS.
609	HOW IS MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM RELATED TO ANTICOLONIALISM? THIS ARTICLE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THIS QUESTION WITH A SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE CASE OF H? CHI MINH. IT ARGUES THAT MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM OFFERS A POWERFUL IDEATIONAL AND DISCURSIVE WEAPON FOR THE COLONIZED PEOPLE TO STRUGGLE AGAINST COLONIALISM. TO UNDERSTAND THIS, THE ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF ANTICOLONIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM', DEFINED AS A FORM OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN WHICH ANTICOLONIALISTS EMPLOY THE LANGUAGE AND IDEAS OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM TO COMBAT THE PREDATORY COLONIAL GOVERNMENT AND TO EXPRESS THE ASPIRATIONS TO A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. ANTICOLONIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM EMERGES UNDER THREE CONDITIONS, NAMELY EXPLOITATORY AND ARBITRARY COLONIALISM, ANTICOLONIALISM, AND CONSTITUTIONAL ENLIGHTENMENT. THE CASE OF H? CHI MINH ILLUSTRATES THIS PHENOMENON WELL. WHEN VIETNAM WAS UNDER FRENCH COLONIALISM AS A PART OF FRENCH INDOCHINA DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, VIETNAMESE ANTICOLONIALISM WAS VEHEMENT, AND DIFFERENT ANTICOLONIALISTS EMPLOYED THE LANGUAGE AND IDEAS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM TO OPPOSE THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THEM WAS H? CHI MINH, CONSIDERED BY MANY VIETNAMESE AS THE FATHER AND ICON OF THE NATION. A TREMENDOUSLY INFLUENTIAL ANTICOLONIALIST, HE WAS ENLIGHTENED WITH CONSTITUTIONALIST KNOWLEDGE AND EMPLOYED KEY IDEAS OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM, NAMELY A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION, THE RULE OF LAW, POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO STRUGGLE AGAINST FRENCH COLONIALISM AND TO EXPRESS SUCH ASPIRATIONS TO A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN VIETNAM. THIS STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRAJECTORY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CONTEMPORARY VIETNAM GIVEN THE CONTINUING INFLUENCE OF H? CHI MINH'S CONSTITUTIONALIST DISCOURSE IN THE COUNTRY NOWADAYS. MORE GENERALLY, THIS STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND ANTICOLONIALISM.
610	THE RECENT FASHION IN THE CANADIAN LAW OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IS TO APPLY THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD OF REVIEW TO VIRTUALLY ANY DECISION RENDERED BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKER. REASONABLENESS REVIEW IS A DEFERENTIAL STANDARD OF REVIEW THAT REQUIRES A COURT TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION FALLS WITHIN A RANGE OF REASONABLE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DEFENSIBLE IN LIGHT OF THE FACTS AND LAW. WHEN REASONABLENESS REVIEW IS APPLIED TO QUESTIONS OF LAW, THE SUPREME COURT HAS OCCASIONALLY RULED THAT THE QUESTION ADMITS OF ONLY ONE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION AND HAS AFFIRMED OR QUASHED AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION ON THAT BASIS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE DIFFICULT QUESTION OF WHETHER A JUDICIAL DECISION AFFIRMING THAT A PROVISION ADMITS OF ONLY ONE REASONABLE INTERPRETATION IS STRICTLY BINDING ON AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKER INTERPRETING THAT PROVISION IN THE FUTURE. IF REASONABLENESS REVIEW IS PREMISED ON DEFERENCE, THEN DEFERENCE OUGHT TO APPLY TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKER'S INTERPRETATION OF THAT QUESTION IN THE FUTURE, EVEN IF IT DIFFERS FROM THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION. AFTER SITUATING THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE PRINCIPLED FOUNDATION OF THE CANADIAN LAW OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM, ATTEMPTING TO BALANCE THE NEED TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST THE RATIONALE FOR DEFERENCE TO ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT ULTIMATELY CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING THAT, SHOULD CANADIAN COURTS CONTINUE TO APPLY REASONABLENESS REVIEW TO VIRTUALLY ALL QUESTIONS OF LAW, A UNIQUELY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW APPROACH TO STARE DECISIS WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A COHERENT AND PRINCIPLED SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW.
611	CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DELIVERY OF SURGICAL CARE IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS). HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THEIR COLLECTIVE CONTRIBUTION, TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CARE THEY PROVIDE IN NATIONAL SURGICAL PLANS, AND TO MAXIMIZE COORDINATION BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS, A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE OF THESE GROUPS IS REQUIRED. WE AIMED TO CREATE SUCH A DATABASE USING WEB-AVAILABLE DATA. WE SEARCHED FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT MEET THE UNITED NATIONS RULE OF LAW DEFINITION OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDE SURGERY IN LMICS. WE TERMED THESE SURGICAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (S-NGOS). WE SCREENED MULTIPLE SOURCES INCLUDING A LISTING OF DISASTER RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS, MEDICAL VOLUNTEERISM DATABASES, CHARITY COMMISSIONS, AND THE RESULTS OF A LITERATURE SEARCH. WE PERFORMED A SECONDARY REVIEW OF EACH ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATION'S WEBSITE TO VERIFY INCLUSION CRITERIA AND EXTRACTED DATA. WE FOUND 403 S-NGOS PROVIDING SURGERY IN ALL 139 LMICS, WITH MOST (61 %) INCORPORATING SURGERY INTO A BROADER SPECTRUM OF HEALTH SERVICES. OVER 80 % OF S-NGOS HAD AN OFFICE IN THE USA, THE UK, CANADA, INDIA, OR AUSTRALIA, AND THEY MOST COMMONLY PROVIDED SURGERY IN INDIA (87 S-NGOS), HAITI (71), KENYA (60), AND ETHIOPIA (55). THE MOST COMMON SPECIALTIES PROVIDED WERE GENERAL SURGERY (184), OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY (140), AND PLASTIC SURGERY (116). THIS NEW CATALOG INCLUDES THE LARGEST NUMBER OF S-NGOS TO DATE, BUT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE INCOMPLETE. THIS LIST WILL BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION BETWEEN S-NGOS, NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEMS, AND GLOBAL HEALTH POLICYMAKERS.
612	WHAT DEFERENCE IS DUE THE EXECUTIVE IN FOREIGN RELATIONS? GIVEN THE CONSIDERABLE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INSTITUTIONAL VIRTUES OF THE EXECUTIVE IN THIS REALM, SOME JUDICIAL DEFERENCE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE. INDEED, COURTS CURRENTLY DEFER TO THE EXECUTIVE IN A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES. ERIC POSNER AND CASS SUNSTEIN NEVERTHELESS CALL FOR A DRAMATIC EXPANSION IN THE DEFERENCE THAT COURTS ACCORD EXECUTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW IN THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS CONTEXT. THEY MAINTAIN THAT COURTS SHOULD PRESUMPTIVELY GIVE CHEVRON-STYLE DEFERENCE TO EXECUTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW - EVEN IF THE EXECUTIVE INTERPRETATION IS ARTICULATED ONLY AS A LITIGATION POSITION, AND EVEN IF IT VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN OUR VIEW, SUBSTANTIAL DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE IS SINGULARLY INAPPROPRIATE IN A LARGE SWATH OF CASES ELIGIBLE FOR CHEVRON DEFERENCE UNDER THEIR PROPOSAL - NAMELY, THOSE INVOLVING FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW THAT OPERATES IN WHAT WE CALL THE "EXECUTIVE-CONSTRAINING ZONE." COURTS HAVE SCRUTINIZED, AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE, EXECUTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT HAS THE STATUS OF SUPREME FEDERAL LAW, THAT IS MADE AT LEAST IN PART OUTSIDE THE EXECUTIVE, AND THAT CONDITIONS THE EXERCISE OF EXECUTIVE POWER. FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FOREIGN RELATIONS CONTEXT. IT WOULD ALSO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT IN WAYS THAT WOULD SUBVERT THE NATION'S INTERESTS, DISCOURAGE THE EXECUTIVE FROM DEVELOPING IMPORTANT INTERNAL CHECKS ON PRESIDENTIAL POWER, AND LEAD TO LESS CONGRESSIONAL REGULATION OF THE EXECUTIVE. IN SHORT, WE MAINTAIN THAT DEFERENCE AT SOME POINT INVITES DISREGARD AND THAT LAW-INTERPRETING AUTHORITY AT SOME POINT EFFECTIVELY CONSTITUTES LAWBREAKING AUTHORITY.
613	MORE AND MORE OFTEN I THINK ABOUT JUST WHAT A DEMOCRATIC, RULE-OF-LAW STATE IS. CRITICISM OF THE PAST, GENEROUS PROMISES, NEW SLOGANS.... BUT IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY WE ARE BUILDING-IF INDEED WE ARE BUILDING ANYTHING HAVING DESTROYED THE OLD ONE AT A SWOOP. WE COULD SAY, ''EVERYTHING IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE....'' AND IT IS! BUT WE CAN ALSO SAY THAT WE ARE GROWING UP, SHAKING OFF EVERYTHING THAT IS HIDEBOUND AND MOTH-EATEN, AND GOING BACK TO THE GOOD THINGS WE USED TO DO. YOUNG SHOOTS OF CREATIVITY ARE SPROUTING, ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW THEY MAY BE HARD TO SEE AMONG THE GENERAL RUINS AND DESPAIR, BUT THEY ARE THERE. ORLENOK HAS NOW PRODUCED THREE SPECIALIZED CONTINGENTS OF YOUNG SOCIAL EDUCATORS, AND WE WILL AGAIN RETURN TO THIS INTERESTING FORM OF SOCIALIZING THE PERSONALITY, BUT LET ME SAY ONE THING AT THE OUTSET: DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DEPRIVATIONS (WHICH HAVE AFFECTED YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE), CHILDREN ARE STRIVING FOR CREATIVITY. A LOT OF THINGS TODAY ARE BAD, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THERE ARE FEWER FRIVOLOUS CHILDREN, THE KIND WHO THINK ABOUT NOTHING BUT FUN IN LIFE. OUR YOUNGSTERS HAVE BECOME MORE MATURE, MORE PRUDENT-AND MOREOVER, MOST OF THEM AGAIN REVERE THE CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR FATHERLAND, THEY CULTIVATE THIS FEELING IN THEMSELVES FROM THEIR EARLY YEARS ON. THEIR DESIRE NOT TO STAND ALOOF FROM TOUGH PROBLEMS CONFIRMS ONCE MORE THE NECESSITY OF CHANGING THE ATTITUDES HELD BY SOCIETY, THE STATE, AND ALL ADULTS TOWARD THE CHILD.
614	THE MAIN AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF INDIAN BANKS USING A SAMPLE OF 61 BANKS THAT IS, 42 PRIVATE AND 19 PUBLIC BANKS. THE STUDY EMPLOYS DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, CORRELATION ANALYSIS, REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF TWO-WAY VARIABLE INTERCEPT RANDOM EFFECT MODEL, AND ROBUSTNESS CHECKS INCLUDING ROBUST REGRESSION, GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENTS, AND PANEL CORRECTION STANDARD ERROR. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF INDIAN BANKS. PRIVATE BANKS DEMONSTRATE BETTER PERFORMANCE OVER PUBLIC BANKS AND THE EFFECT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF PRIVATE BANKS IS POSITIVE AND IT IS BETTER THAN PUBLIC BANKS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DEMONETISATION HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF INDIAN BANKS AS MEASURED BY RETURN ON ASSETS AND RETURN ON EQUITY, BUT IT ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT IN THE CASE OF NET INTEREST MARGIN. THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT STUDY HAVE CONSIDERABLE IMPLICATIONS FOR REGULATORS, POLICYMAKERS, BANKERS, ANALYSTS, AND ACADEMICIANS. REGULATIONS AND SEVERAL POLICY MEASURES COULD BE INTRODUCED TO IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OF INDIAN BANKS. TO PROMOTE GREATER TRANSPARENCY, BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY, STRONG RULE OF LAW, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, CORRUPTION MUST BE ELIMINATED TO ENHANCE HIGHER PROFITABILITY OF INDIAN BANKS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS NOVEL EVIDENCE LINKING COUNTRY-LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE TO THE PROFITABILITY OF BANKS IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIA, AS AN EMERGING ECONOMY. THEREFORE, IT BRIDGES AN EXISTING GAP IN THE BODY OF LITERATURE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF BANKS IN INDIA.
615	IN AND BEYOND ANTI-COLONIAL STRUGGLES, THE REPRESSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF PRISON ARE VARIOUSLY DEFINED, CONTESTED, AND RECAST BY LAW, INCLUDING THROUGH PRISONER RESISTANCE. THE LIKELIHOOD OF RESISTANCE AND THE NECESSITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN PRISONS APPLY IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED AS CRIMINALS, TERRORISTS, OR POLITICAL PRISONERS. THE PAPER ARTICULATES FOUR SETS OF RELATIONSHIPS CONCERNING LAW AND PRISON: A NORMATIVE ASPIRATION TO LAW AS JUSTICE; THE DIVERSITY OF LAW; THE NECESSITY OF UNIVERSAL RIGHTS IRRESPECTIVE OF PARTICULAR ACTORS OR INSTITUTIONS; AND THE ROLE OF PRISON-BASED STRUGGLES IN CHALLENGING COLONIAL, NEO-COLONIAL, AND OTHER LEGAL REGIMES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE POWER IN CONSTITUTING PRISON RULE IS CONSIDERED THROUGH THE WORK OF JOHN DIIULIO'S ENDORSEMENT OF AUTHORITARIAN PRISON GOVERNANCE AND GIORGIO AGAMBEN'S DYSTOPIAN CONCERNS ABOUT ZONES OF LAWLESSNESS APPLIED TO PRISONS. VARIOUS EXAMPLES, INCLUDING COLONIAL MALAYA, FRENCH INDOCHINA, APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA, NORTHERN IRELAND, EGYPT, AND THE CONTEMPORARY UNITED STATES (INCLUDING GUANTANAMO BAY), ARE CONSIDERED IN THE PAPER TO EXAMINE AND DEVELOP ARGUMENTS. THESE EXEMPLARS ILLUSTRATE OVERLAPPING ELEMENTS OF PRISON REPRESSION AND RESISTANCE VIS-A-VIS LAW DESPITE VERY DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. THE NORMATIVE, THEORETICAL, AND EMPIRICAL PERSPECTIVES AND CASES UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR UNIVERSAL RULES TO PROTECT ALL PRISONERS. THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL LEGAL PROTECTIONS IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE 2015 'NELSON MANDELA RULES', AN EXPANSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS' 'STANDARD MINIMUM RULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRISONERS'. MANDELA'S NAME UNDERSCORES THE ROLE OF RESISTANCE, INCLUDING RESISTANCE THROUGH LAW AND AGAINST LAW, TO ACHIEVE AT LEAST MINIMUM STANDARDS OF TREATMENT OF ALL INCARCERATED PEOPLE.
616	THE INTRODUCTION OF THE OFFICE OF THE BUNDESTAG'S MILITARY OMBUDSMAN THROUGH A 1957 AMENDMENT TO WEST GERMANY'S BASIC LAW WAS AND REMAINS TODAY AN IMPORTANT MANIFESTATION OF THE BUNDESWEHR'S INNERE FUHRUNG. THIS REFORM CONCEPT WAS AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE NEW MILITARY INTO A FORCE THAT RESPECTED THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN IN UNIFORM' AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE YOUNG DEMOCRATIC STATE. THE OMBUDSMAN WAS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CHECK ON WHETHER THESE GOALS WERE BEING MET. HIS OFFICE, THEREFORE, HELD PRACTICAL AND SYMBOLIC VALUE AS A TOOL FOR PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT OF THE MILITARY AND THEREIN THE EXTENSION AND PROTECTION OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PRACTICES IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC. IN THE SUMMER OF 1964, THE CURRENT OMBUDSMAN, HELLMUTH HEYE, RELEASED A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES IN THE ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE QUICK CLAIMING THAT INNERE FUHRUNG WAS UNDER THREAT AND WITH IT GERMANY'S DEMOCRACY. REACTION TO THE ARTICLES WAS SWIFT AND VOCIFEROUS. WHILE OFFICIALS IN BONN UNIVERSALLY DISAVOWED THE CRITICISM, THE WEST GERMAN PUBLIC SUPPORTED HEYE IN THOUSANDS OF LETTERS TO THE MEDIA. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THIS CONTROVERSY AND ARGUES THAT WHILE CONCERN WAS WIDESPREAD, THERE WAS LITTLE CONSENSUS ABOUT A SOLUTION. MILITARY TRAINING THAT WAS TOO HARD' HARKENED BACK TO THE DARK DAYS OF THE WEHRMACHT. TRAINING THAT WAS TOO SOFT' CREATED WEAK, SELFISH MEN. THE WELFARE-SUPPORTED, CONSUMPTION-DRIVEN SOCIETY WAS SEEN AS MUCH AT FAULT AS AN UNREFORMED MILITARY. ULTIMATELY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE QUEST FOR A HEALTHY MALE WHO COULD SERVE AS BOTH A DEMOCRATIC CITIZEN AND A SOLDIER.
617	THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE CURRENT DEBATES REGARDING THE POLITICS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE UNIVERSAL CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS CONSIDERED AS A REGULATIVE PRINCIPLE FOR THE POSSIBLE CRITIQUE OF ANY STATE, INCLUDING A DEMOCRATIC ONE. MOREOVER, THE PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE UNIVERSAL REGULATIVE PRINCIPLE FOR EVALUATING THESE STATES IS VITAL FOR PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CHANGE AND FOR THE POLITICS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. AT THE HEART OF THE ANALYSIS IS KANT'S CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS FREEDOM. IT IS OPPOSED TO A MORE UTILITARIAN INTERPRETATION OF RIGHTS AND POLITICAL PATERNALISM. KANT'S PHILOSOPHY HELPS US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS INHERENT, SACRED, AND INALIENABLE, AS FORMULATED BY THOMAS JEFFERSON IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. KANT MAKES THESE MEANINGS EXPLICIT, AND HE ELABORATES ON THE MORAL-PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLANATIONS OF HUMANITARIAN RIGHTS. HIS PHILOSOPHY OF LAW WAS DEVELOPED IN A PROCESS OF A SYSTEMATIC CRITICISM OF POLITICAL PATERNALISM (WHICH IS THE FLIP SIDE OF DEPENDENCE). KANT DEVELOPED HIS DEFINITION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IN OPPOSITION TO AUTHORITARIAN PATERNALISM, UTILITARIAN ARBITRARINESS, AND THE "DESPOTISM OF PATERNALISTIC BENEVOLENCE." THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IS THREEFOLD: THE IMPERATIVES OF MORALITY, RIGHT, AND PEACE. THUS IT COULD BE INTERPRETED AS "THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE OF PEACE." THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE ONGOING RELEVANCE OF KANT'S IDEAS AND THEIR RECENT DEVELOPMENT BY THE THEORISTS OF "DISCOURSE ETHICS" AND OF "COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY." IT AFFIRMS THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS OF SECURING PEACE AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY PEACEFUL MEANS, BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
618	THE EXISTING CHINESE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS IS CHALLENGED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW FOR THE PROMOTION OF THE MAJORITY LANGUAGE. THE REGIONAL NATIONAL AUTONOMY LAW (RNAL) IS A CENTRE-PIECE IN THE PROTECTION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS HAVING THE AIM OF GUARANTEEING THE RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY NATIONALITIES TO ADMINISTER THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THAT, THE RNAL STIPULATES THAT THE AUTONOMOUS ORGANS SHALL GUARANTEE THE FREEDOM OF THE MINORITY NATIONALITIES TO USE AND DEVELOP THEIR LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND TRADITIONS. THE LAW-AND DECISION-MAKING POWERS OF THE AUTONOMOUS ORGANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF HIGHER LEVEL AUTHORITIES UNDER THE RULES OF GOVERNANCE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF 'DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM'. THIS RESEARCH ARGUES THAT, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS TO PROMOTE THE MAJORITY LANGUAGE, THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE RNAL CANNOT PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. NEVERTHELESS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOUNDS THAT SINCE CHINA HAS PROCLAIMED THAT IT IS MOVING TOWARDS GOVERNANCE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS COULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN THIS TRANSITION BY INCREASING THE CLARITY OF THE AIMS OF THE PROTECTION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, THE ROLE OF THE AUTONOMOUS ORGANS COULD BE STRENGTHENED AND CLARIFIED BY THE ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS AND SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RNAL BY CENTRAL AND PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES.
619	THIS ARTICLE APPROACHES THE ORGINALISM DEBATE FROM A NEW ANGLE-THROUGH THE LENS OF THE RECENTLY DEFEATED FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT. THERE WAS PROFOUND AND VERY PUBLIC DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE FMA-IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT IT WOULD HAVE HAD ON CIVIL UNIONS. THE INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEANING OF THE FMA WITH RESPECT TO THE CIVIL UNIONS QUESTION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT OFTEN THE PROBLEM WITH ORIGINALISM IS NOT JUST THAT THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEANING OF CENTURIES-OLD PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IS HARD TO FIND (ESPECIALLY BY JUDGES UNTRAINED IN HISTORY). THE PROBLEM IS FREQUENTLY MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL, AND MUCH MORE FATAL; IT IS THAT THERE WAS NO ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEANING TO BEGIN WITH. IT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION ADDRESSING A DEEPLY CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT CAN ONLY BE ENACTED WHEN IT IS DRAFTED WITH HIGHLY AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE SO THAT, RATHER THAN POSSESSING A SINGLE ORIGINAL MEANING, IT APPEALS TO DISPARATE FACTIONS WITH DIVERGENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF ITS TERMS. AS SUCH, THE CENTRAL PREMISE OF ORIGINALISM-THAT, INJUSTICE SCALIA'S WORDS, THE CONSTITUTION WAS ENACTED WITH "A FIXED MEANING ASCERTAINABLE THROUGH THE USUAL DEVICES FAMILIAR TO THOSE LEARNED IN THE LAW"-IS OFTEN INACCURATE. AND FOR THAT REASON, THE CENTRAL PROMISE OF ORIGINALISM-THAT, BY RELYING ON AN OBJECTIVE, DISCOVERABLE, FIXED CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING, ORIGINALISM CAN PREVENT JUDGES FROM SUBVERTING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BY READING THEIR PERSONAL VALUES INTO THE CONSTITUTION-IS A FALSE ONE.
620	STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE MEASURES OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ASPECT OF SOCIAL INDICATOR MODEL-BUILDING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL/LOCAL ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH THE CREATION OF A SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX (SDI-2000) FOR HONG KONG SAR (SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA). IN ALL, THE PROCESS LEADING TO THE SDI-2000 REQUIRED TWO YEARS TO COMPLETE AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF MORE THAN 100 POLITICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY LEADERS REPRESENTING ALL ASPECTS OF COLLECTIVE SOCIAL LIFE IN THE SAR. CONSISTING OF 47 INDICATORS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS 14 SECTORS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, THE SDI-2000 REVEALED PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT BOTH AFFIRMED THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HONG KONG'S CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES - MOSTLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ECONOMIC, EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES - AND, VIA ANOTHER SET OF RELATED INDICATORS, IDENTIFIED AREAS OF CONSIDERABLE SOCIAL INSTABILITY FOR WHICH NEW DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES ARE NEEDED - ESPECIALLY IN REDUCING GROWING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES WITHIN AND BETWEEN POPULATION GROUPS THAT LARGELY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE SAR'S RECENT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY - I.E., LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS, CHILDREN AND YOUTH, AND THE ELDERLY. THE ARTICLE ALSO IDENTIFIES WAYS IN WHICH FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SDI CAN BE STRENGTHENED - INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADDITION OF SUBINDEXES THAT MEASURE THE SAR'S CHANGES OVER TIME IN RELATION TO RULE OF LAW, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THE IMPACT OF THE SOCIAL SERVICE IN REDUCING SOCIAL INEQUALITY. THE SDI-2000'S CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY SUBINDEX ALSO NEEDS TO BE REVISED.
621	THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS DEDICATED TO ENHANCING THE LEVEL OF INFORMATIZATION IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND INCREASE CREDIBILITY. CURRENTLY, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EXPOSED SUCH PROBLEMS AS INSUFFICIENT FORCE, DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTING EVIDENCE, AND LOW EVIDENTIAL POWER. THESE PROBLEMS CONTRADICT THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW AND STANDARDIZATION. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE IMPLEMENTED ADVANCED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR URBAN ADMINISTRATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING BIG DATA, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND IOT. AMONG THESE TECHNOLOGIES, IOT IS THE CORE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INNOVATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT PLATFORMS. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS RELY ON BATTERIES OR DEDICATED POWER SOURCES, LEADING TO MAINTENANCE CHALLENGES AND HIGH POWER CONSUMPTION. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AT-EYE, A NEW VIDEO COMMUNICATION PARADIGM FOR ALL-TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT VIDEO MONITORING, WHICH IS BATTERY-FREE AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT. THE KEY ENABLER OF AT-EYE IS AMBIENT BACKSCATTER TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ENABLES ENERGY HARVESTING AND VIDEO COMMUNICATION SIMULTANEOUSLY. UNLIKE PREVIOUS METHODS, OUR PROPOSAL INTRODUCES A NOVEL CCK-BASED MODULATION FOR TAG CAMERAS AND ACHIEVES 4-WAY CONCURRENCY. THE MODULATION IS SIMPLE BECAUSE IT USES PHASE DIFFERENCE AND IT IS ENERGY-EFFICIENT BECAUSE GENERATING SQUARE WAVES IS ADEQUATE. MOREOVER, TO ENSURE FULL COMPATIBILITY WITH COTS WIFI, WE MODULATE THE PHYSICAL SERVICE DATA UNIT. THEREFORE, DATA RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE USING ONLY COMMERCIAL NICS. WE CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTS TO EXAMINE OUR PROPOSAL AND EXPERIMENT RESULTS SHOW THAT AT-EYE ACHIEVES A THROUGHPUT OF 10.8 MBPS WITH COTS RADIOS. WE ALSO SIMULATE A 16-WAY BATTERY-FREE TAG CAMERA SYSTEM, DEMONSTRATING AT-EYE'S FEASIBILITY OF HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO COMMUNICATION.
622	THE GREEN GROWTH PARADIGM HAS GAINED MUCH ATTENTION IN THE LAST DECADE. GREEN GROWTH NOT ONLY PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN BEINGS BUT ALSO SERVES AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SCARCE NATURAL ASSETS. GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS DEVELOP LAWS AND POLICIES FOR ALL INDUSTRIES IN A COUNTRY AND ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR NATURAL RESOURCE EXPLORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OR DESTRUCTION. PAKISTAN IS THE FIFTH MOST VULNERABLE COUNTRY TO ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS IN THE WORLD. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONS AMONG GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, ISO 14001 AND GREEN GROWTH IN PAKISTAN BY USING TIME-SERIES DATA FROM 2000 TO 2017. THE STUDY UTILIZED ADVANCED MATHEMATICAL GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS (GRA) MODELS, NAMELY, ABSOLUTE GREY RELATIONAL GRADE (GRG), DENG'S GRG, AND SECOND SYNTHETIC DEGREE OF GREY INCIDENCE ANALYSIS (SSGIG) MODELS, TO CAPTURE THE RELATIONS AMONG THE STUDIED VARIABLES. THE MAIN RESULTS REVEALED THAT ISO 14001, WITH THE HIGHEST GRA VALUES OF 0.8-0.9, PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CHANNELING GREEN GROWTH. AMONG ALL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS RELATED TO GREEN GROWTH, THE RULE OF LAW WITH THE HIGHEST MAXIMIN CRITERION VALUE OF 0.644 WAS FOUND TO PLAY A KEY ROLE FOR PAKISTAN. THE STUDY FINDINGS PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO HOW GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ACCOMPLISHING THE OBJECTIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THEY CAN ALSO HELP LEGISLATORS AND ORGANIZATIONS UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ISO 14001 CERTIFICATION TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES ACROSS SECTORS IN PAKISTAN.

623	THE TERM WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES (WOTUS) HAS BEEN A PART OF US LEGAL JARGON SINCE IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE 1972 AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT, NOW KNOWN AS THE CLEAN WATER ACT. FOR THE PAST NEARLY 50 YEARS, THIS TERMINOLOGY HAS CAUSED CONFUSION AND DISSENSION AMONG LAWMAKERS, REGULATORS, ENGINEERS, AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS PRESIDED OVER CASES THAT REST ON WHAT IS ENCOMPASSED IN WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES, BUT THE COURT HAS NOT STATED CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING IF A WATER BODY IS PART OF WOTUS. THIS ISSUE CAME TO A HEAD IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CLEAN WATER RULE (CWR), WHICH WIDELY EXPANDED THE REGULATORY POWER OF THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY DUE TO THEIR REDEFINITION OF WOTUS IN 2015. IN 2017, THE NEW WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER, TITLED RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW, FEDERALISM, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH BY REVIEWING THE "WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES" RULE, EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 13778 [82 FED. REG. 12497 (FEBRUARY 28, 2017)], TO "REVISE OR RESCIND" THE CWR, WHICH RESULTED IN A PROPOSED REDEFINITION OF WOTUS IN 2018. THE NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION RULE (NWPR) IS THE RESULT OF THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER AND OUTLINES THE CURRENT DEFINITION AND APPROPRIATE USES OF WOTUS. BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION OF WOTUS HAS FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS AND REGULATORS, THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE HISTORY, CONTENTIONS, AND CURRENT STATE OF THE USE AND DEFINITION OF WOTUS.

624	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) - THE ABILITY OF A COMPUTER OR A ROBOT TO PERFORM TASKS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLIGENT BEINGS - REPRESENTS BOTH A NEW CHALLENGE AND A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE OF SPACE ACTIVITIES. INDEED, INCREASING CONNECTIVITY AND SYMBIOTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND INTELLIGENT MACHINES RAISE SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTEMPORARY ETHICS, INCLUDING THE APPLICABLE RULES RELATING TO LIABILITY IN CASE OF DAMAGE ARISING FROM ADVANCED AI. AI ALSO ENCOMPASSES A SERIES OF COMPLEX ISSUES THAT CUT ACROSS SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, PUBLIC POLICY, TECHNOLOGICAL, LEGAL, ETHICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY BOUNDARIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AI-BASED AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS IS EQUALLY RELEVANT IN THE CONTEXT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS AND ON THE BATTLEFIELD, PARTICULARLY WITH THE USE OF DRONES AND, MORE CONTROVERSIALLY, LETHAL AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS SYSTEMS. AFTER OUTLINING THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON AI SYSTEMS FOR SPACE OPERATIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THESE INTERACT WITH EXISTING LEGAL CONCEPTS AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES HOW SPACE LAW IS RELEVANT AND APPLICABLE TO AI USE IN THE CONTEXT OF SPACE MISSIONS. THE SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES OF AUTONOMOUS SPACE SYSTEMS MAY ALSO REQUIRE FURTHER CONSIDERATION AS TO THE TRADITIONAL APPLICATION OF THE AUTHORIZATION OF SPACE MISSIONS, THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES AND THE LIABILITY REGIME IN CASE OF DAMAGE. AS A PRECURSOR TO MORE DETAILED RESEARCH IN THE FUTURE, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO INTRODUCE SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL ISSUES THAT AI-DRIVEN AUTOMATED PROCESSES MIGHT POSE FOR SPACE OPERATIONS.

625	BASED ON TWO YEARS OJ ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK IN MENTAL HEALTH COURTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, THIS ARTICLE JUXTAPOSES THE FIXITY THAT DEFINES THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF JURISDICTION WITH THE ITINERACY OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS JUDGED BY CRIMINAL COURTS. I ASSERT THAT JURISDICTION IS AN ATTEMPT AT CONTROL: BY INVOKING JURISDICTION, COURTS ATTEMPT TO FIX PEOPLE AND OBJECTS WITHIN TIME AND SPACE SO AS TO YIELD A NARRATIVE OF LIBERAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHICH DEFENDANTS CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. RATHER THAN ASSUME THE VANTAGE POINT OJTHE LAW, I STICK WITH HARRIET, A PERSON WHO WAS HOMELESS AND SUBJECT TO A MENTAL HEALTH COURT'S ATTEMPT AT CONTROL. MOVING AWAY FROM THE LAW EXPOSES WHEN STATE ATTEMPTS AT CONTROL JAIL. CLAIMS TO JURISDICTION REFLECT THE STATE'S RELIANCE ON CONTROL THROUGH A PARTICULAR CHRONOTOPE OF LINEAR TIME AND DIVISIBLE SPACE. IN DIFFERENTLY CONFIGURING TIME AND SPACE AS CYCLICAL AND UNBOUNDED, HARRIET CONFOUNDS THE LAW'S ATTEMPT AT CONTROL. FURTHER, THE STATE'S INVOCATION OF JURISDICTION AS A CONCEPT THAT FIXES TIME AND SPACE PRODUCES UNRULY AFFECTS, OR COORDINATES OF RELATION THAT ESCAPE A RULE OF LAW PRESENTING ITSELF AS RATIONAL. HARRIET'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS REFLECT AND ENABLE HER ESCAPE FROM STATE CONTROL: THEY INHABIT AN AFFECTIVE ATMOSPHERE THAT IS PRODUCED BY THE LAW'S OWN CHRONOTOPIC TERMS, BUT THAT REJECT THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE LAW UNDERSTANDS AS A PRODUCT OF CLAIMS TO JURISDICTION. IN PAYING ATTENTION TO MISSED ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN HARRIET AND THE COURT, THIS ARTICLE REVEALS AND THEORIZES MOMENTS IN WHICH POWER ESCAPES ITS OWN TERMS AND ENTERS ASOCIAL, DEINDIVIDUATED, AFFECTIVE SPHERE.
626	THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) ADVISORY OPINION ON THE LEGALITY OF THE THREAT OR USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN 1996 WAS A LANDMARK CASE BECAUSE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, THE LEGAL ASPECT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS ADDRESSED. THE DECISION HAS EVOKED CONTROVERSIES REGARDING THE COURT'S CONCLUSION, THE LEGAL STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW IN RELATION TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND A NEWLY INTRODUCED CONCEPT OF STATE SURVIVAL. WHILE MUCH LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP DISCUSSES AND CRITICIZES THE LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OPINION, THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINING THE COURT'S SPECIFIC CHOICE OF WORDS AND CONCEPTS THAT SUSTAIN ITS WIDER IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL POSITION IN THE OPINION. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE COURT'S VAGUE AND CONTROVERSIAL LOGIC IS ATTRIBUTED TO ITS CONFRONTATION WITH TWO INTERNATIONAL ORDERS/CODES: THE LEGAL ORDER (OR INTERNATIONAL LAW) AND THE POLITICAL ORDER (OR STATE PRACTICE). THE PAPER ENGAGES IN LEGAL SEMIOTICS AS METHODOLOGY TO DECODE LEGAL TEXT AND DISCOVER A DEEP STRUCTURE THAT SUSTAINS NETWORKS OF CODES, ACCORDING TO WHICH TEXT IS INTERPRETED. THROUGH THE SEMIOTIC EXAMINATION OF THREE SETS OF KEY CONCEPTS (1) "PERMITTED" AND "PROHIBITED," (2) "THREAT OF USE" AND "POSSESSION OF THE WEAPON," AND (3) "STATE SURVIVAL," THE PAPER SHOWS THE ICJ'S CONFRONTATION WITH TWO ORDERS/CODES AND EVENTUAL PRIORITIZATION OF THE POLITICAL ORDER OVER THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. THE ANALYSIS OF THE OPINION BASED ON LEGAL SEMIOTICS INDICATES AN INTIMATE AND INSEPARABLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE PRACTICE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH MUST BE DISENTANGLED FOR THE SAKE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
627	IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF BUDGETARY MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTING OVERSPENDING THAT WITH AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE ARE FUNDAMENTAL CONDITIONS OF BUDGET STABILITY AND ISSUES OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. RULE-BASED BUDGET MEANS MORE THAN MERELY A STIPULATION THAT PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENTS SHALL OBSERVE THE RULES OF BUDGET PLANNING AND EXECUTION AND THAT THE REAL AND BUDGETARY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY ARE CHARACTERISED BY THE RULE OF LAW. RULE-BASED BUDGET REQUIRES THE EMPLOYMENT OF NUMERICAL AND PROCEDURAL REGULATIONS BY INSTITUTIONALLY ENSURING THEIR RESPECTIVE OBSERVANCE. REGARDING THE LATTER WE CAN DECLARE THAT IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE INTEREST HAS GROWN RECENTLY IN FISCAL COUNCILS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOOTING UP LIKE MUSHROOMS AND ARE BELIEVED TO BE VIRTUALLY "THE ULTIMATE WEAPON" IN FIGHTING BUDGETARY OVERSPENDING. THE DEMAND FOR CREATING SUCH NEW INSTITUTIONS AT THE SAME TIME UNDENIABLY REPRESENTS CRITICISM CONCERNING THE FORMER PROCESSES OF THE PLANNING MECHANISMS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONALISED SOLUTIONS. THIS PAPER ASPIRES TO PROVIDE A PICTURE AS REGARDS TO WHAT EXTENT FISCAL COUNCILS CAN BE REGARDED AS A NEW TYPE OF ORGANISATION WITHIN THE FAMILY OF INDEPENDENT FISCAL INSTITUTIONS (IFIS) THAT REFLECT INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND, IN THE PUBLIC LAW OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES HAVING ACCESSED THE EU FOLLOWING 2004, REPRESENT THE BEST SOLUTION TO BE RECOMMENDED, I.E. THE BEST PRACTICE. THIS NON-EXHAUSTIVE OVERVIEW DEALS WITH THE COURSE OF THE INDEPENDENT BUDGETARY INSTITUTIONS OF THOSE EASTERN-CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT ACCESSED THE EUROPEAN UNION IN 2004, RESPECTIVELY THEIR MISSION AND CONCEPT OF AN INSTITUTION, WHILE IT ALSO REFERS TO THE ROLE OF THESE ORGANISATIONS IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT.
628	THE CREATION OF THE APPELLATE BODY (AB) OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) ENTAILS AN UNPRECEDENTED DELEGATION OF POWER TO AN INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATOR, BECAUSE THE WTO REQUIRES STATES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE OF THEIR DOMESTIC REGULATIONS WITH THE SWEEPING OBLIGATIONS IN WTO AGREEMENTS. THIS IS LEGITIMIZED IN SOME ACADEMIC ANALYSES AND MUCH POLITICAL RHETORIC IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, SUGGESTING THAT THE ROLE OF THE ADJUDICATOR IS MERELY TO APPLY THE PRECISE WORDS OF THE TEXTS AGREED BY STATES, ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURAL MEANING. THE AB HAS SUPPORTED THIS BY ADOPTING A FORMALIST APPROACH THAT COMBINES AN OBJECTIVIST VIEW OF MEANING WITH A LEGALISTIC STYLE OF JUDGMENT. HOWEVER, BOTH THE GENERAL STRUCTURE AND MANY OF THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE WTO AGREEMENTS ARE INDETERMINATE AND RAISE ISSUES OF INTERPRETATION THAT WERE KNOWN TO BE HIGHLY CONTESTABLE. ALTHOUGH THE DELEGATION OF ADJUDICATION IN ITS EARLY PHASE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE OF A NARROW TECHNICAL FUNCTION, IN THE CURRENT PHASE INTERPRETATION IS MORE CLEARLY SEEN TO INVOLVE A FLEXIBLE APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES TO CASES IN LIGHT OF THE POLICIES INVOLVED. THE AB'S ROLE WOULD BE BETTER LEGITIMIZED BY ADOPTING A MORE OPEN EPISTEMOLOGY AND REASONING THAT COULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDER CONSTITUENCY. HOWEVER, IT IS CONSTRAINED BY FEAR OF USURPING THE POLITICAL LEGITIMACY OF THE GOVERNMENTS TO WHICH IT IS PRIMARILY ACCOUNTABLE, AND GOVERNMENTS, IN TURN, ARE MOTIVATED BY A RELUCTANCE TO ADMIT TO THEIR DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES HOW MUCH POWER HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO SUPRANATIONAL INSTANCES SUCH AS THE AB.
629	A NEW MOTIVATION FOR MARINE RESTORATION HAS BEEN OBSERVED, ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISSATISFACTION WITH CURRENT MARINE RESTORATION GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS (MRGAS). AN MRGA CONSISTS OF ALLIANCES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS (COALITIONS) WHO, THROUGH THEIR COMMON CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE PROBLEM (DISCOURSES), TRY TO INFLUENCE AND DESIGN MARINE RESTORATION ACTIVITIES WHILE CONSIDERING THE RULES OF DECISION-MAKING, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF LIMITED RESOURCES. EMERGING MRGAS RISE IN PARALLEL TO EXISTING ONES AND AIM TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SAME GOALS OR SHOW ANOTHER WAY OF REACHING THOSE GOALS. THIS PHENOMENON RAISES QUESTIONS OF LEGITIMACY BOTH FOR THE EMERGING AND THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENT. BUILDING ON EXISTING LITERATURE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPLORE INPUT, THROUGHPUT AND OUTPUT LEGITIMACY AS THREE ESSENTIAL PRE-CONDITIONS OF LEGITIMACY FOR MRGAS. THE FRAMEWORK IS TESTED IN THREE EUROPEAN CASES OF MRGAS THAT WERE PART OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MERCES PROJECT (). ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT ACTORS WHO ARE INFLUENTIAL IN ACHIEVING RESTORATION GOALS, AND ALSO THOSE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY RESTORATION ACTIONS, SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE MRGAS (INPUT LEGITIMACY); ACTORS WITHIN MRGAS SHOULD ESTABLISH AND FOLLOW PROCEDURES FOR DECISION-MAKING THAT ARE BOTH TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR (THROUGHPUT LEGITIMACY); AND ACTORS WITHIN MRGAS NEED TO ESTABLISH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF RESTORATION, OF THE GOAL TO REACH AND OF THE RELATED UNCERTAINTIES (OUTPUT LEGITIMACY). AWARENESS OF THESE PRE-CONDITIONS ALLOWS ACTORS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO MRGAS TO ADDRESS ASPECTS THAT GIVE LEGITIMACY TO RESTORATION ACTIONS. IT ALSO CREATES A LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS ACTORS TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION ON LEGITIMACY THAT GOES BEYOND THE MERE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
630	CAN A LACK OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CONTRIBUTE TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING? THIS PAPER USES THE CASE OF POLAND TO ARGUE THAT SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CAN BE LINKED TO DEMOCRATIC EROSION. IN DOING SO, THE PAPER ADJUDICATES BETWEEN TWO THEORIES OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. THE FIRST, ADVANCED BY MILAN SVOLIK, ARGUES THAT ELITE POLARIZATION DRIVES EROSION: WHEN POLITICAL CANDIDATES ARE IDEOLOGICALLY FAR APART, CITIZENS WHO STRONGLY PREFER ONE OVER THE OTHER MAY TURN A BLIND EYE TO ANTIDEMOCRATIC TRANSGRESSIONS BY THEIR PREFERRED CANDIDATE TO PREVENT THE COMPETING CANDIDATE FROM WINNING. THE SECOND THEORY, PRESENTED BY NALEPA, VANBERG, AND CIOPRIS (NVC), DESCRIBES AN EQUILIBRIUM WHERE VOTERS ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE CANDIDATE THEY ARE DEALING WITH IS A CLOSET AUTOCRAT OR AN IDEOLOGICAL INCUMBENT, BUT REELECT HIM INTO OFFICE REGARDLESS. THIS THEORY POSITS THAT A CLOSET AUTOCRAT IS REELECTED INTO OFFICE BECAUSE HIS FIRST PERIOD ACTIONS ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF AN IDEOLOGICAL INCUMBENT. I ARGUE THAT JUDICIARY REFORMS IN POLAND REFLECT EXACTLY THE KIND OF INCUMBENT ACTIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT BOTH WITH THE ACTIONS OF AN IDEOLOGICAL INCUMBENT AND WITH THE ACTIONS OF A CLOSET AUTOCRAT. USING SURVEY DATA FROM POLAND, I FIND EVIDENCE OF ELITE POLARIZATION, OFFERING SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST THEORY, BUT ALSO FIND AMPLE EVIDENCE OF POLARIZATION IN THE ELECTORATE AND OF A BELIEF STRUCTURE SUPPORTIVE OF THE EQUILIBRIUM FROM NVC. I PRESENT HUNGARY'S EXPERIENCE WITH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW AS A SHADOW CASE TO ILLUSTRATE SIMILAR DYNAMICS TO THOSE TAKING PLACE IN POLAND.
631	AN UNDERSTANDING OF CONTEMPORARY U.S. POLITICS REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND PERCEPTIONS OF OUTGROUP THREAT. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE THREAT OF TERRORISM AND GROWING AUTHORITARIANISM WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HELP TO EXPLAIN DONALD TRUMP'S ELECTORAL VICTORY (HETHERINGTON & WEILER, 2009; MACWILLIAMS, 2016). WE REPLICATED AND EXTENDED PREVIOUS FINDINGS THROUGH THE USE OF 2 SURVEYS COMPLETED BY 704 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUND THAT THOSE HIGHER IN AUTHORITARIANISM WERE MORE CONSERVATIVE, MORE REPUBLICAN, MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT TRUMP, AND MORE LIKELY TO PERCEIVE MEXICANS AND MUSLIMS AS THREATENING. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND THAT THOSE HIGH IN AUTHORITARIANISM AND OUTGROUP THREAT PERCEPTION WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT ANTIDEMOCRATIC POLICIES TARGETING OUTGROUPS (SUCH AS IMPLEMENTING A MUSLIM REGISTRY AND PROFILING MEXICANS) AND TO ABANDON THE RULE OF LAW BY POSTPONING ELECTIONS AND FAST-TRACKING THE DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. TOGETHER, AUTHORITARIANISM AND OUTGROUP THREAT ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE VARIANCE IN SUPPORT FOR TRUMP AND IN SUPPORT FOR THESE ANTIDEMOCRATIC POLICIES. WE FOUND THAT WHILE PERCEPTIONS OF OUTGROUP THREAT EXPLAIN MORE UNIQUE VARIANCE FOR IMPLICITLY ANTIDEMOCRATIC POLICIES (THOSE WHERE THE PUBLIC MIGHT NOT REALIZE THAT THE POLICIES VIOLATED DEMOCRATIC NORMS), AUTHORITARIANISM EXPLAINED MORE UNIQUE VARIANCE IN SUPPORT OF MORE EXPLICITLY ANTIDEMOCRATIC POLICIES (THOSE WHERE THE PUBLIC KNEW THE POLICIES WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL). FINALLY, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ALTEMEYER'S (1981) ORIGINAL CONCEPTION OF AUTHORITARIANISM AS CONSISTING OF 3 DISTINCT COMPONENTS (AGGRESSION, SUBMISSION, AND CONVENTIONALISM) IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING CONTEMPORARY U.S. POLITICAL ATTITUDES AND THAT AGGRESSION HAD THE BIGGEST INFLUENCE ON SUPPORT FOR ANTIDEMOCRATIC POLICIES TARGETING OUTGROUPS.
632	THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS) WERE DESIGNED TO REALIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES TOWARDS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OF WHICH HEALTHCARE IS THE FOUNDATION. AN EXTENSION OF THE MDGS, THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS), HAS MORE RECENTLY BEEN INTRODUCED AND HAS BECOME THE CORE FOCUS FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) REGARDLESS OF HER PERFORMANCE VIS-A-VIS THE MDGS. A TRANSITION INTO ACCOMPLISHING THE SDGS WITHOUT IDENTIFYING THE EFFICIENCY AND DETERMINANTS OF THE SHORTFALL IN ACHIEVING THE MDGS IS A FLAWED APPROACH. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SSA BASED ON HEALTH FOCUSED MDGS. WE ESTIMATE THE TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY AND TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY OF THESE SYSTEMS, AND RANK THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE OF SSA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS FROM 2010 TO 2015 USING A ROBUST DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) APPROACH. REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS APPLIED TO THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EFFICIENCY. THE DEA RESULTS SHOW HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SSA TO BE INEFFICIENT, WITH ONLY THREE COUNTRIES; BOTSWANA IN 2015, RWANDA IN 2014 AND 2015, AND TANZANIA IN 2015; IDENTIFIED AS EFFICIENT OVER THE EVALUATED PERIOD. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IS THE IDENTIFIED LEADING CAUSE OF A DECREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY. SCALE INEFFICIENCY IS DETERMINED TO BE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF TECHNICAL INEFFICIENCY. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT GOVERNANCE MEASURES, I.E., THE RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFICACY, IMPACT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EFFICIENCY MORE THAN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH, INDICATING THAT THE VOLUME OF RESOURCES INVESTED IN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE SAID RESOURCES IN SSA COUNTRIES.
633	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION MODULATES THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE ON SOME INDICATORS OF THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WITH DATA FROM THE PERIOD 2000-2012 BY EMPLOYING THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS. THREE BROAD CONCEPTS OF GOVERNANCE ARE EXPLORED: (I) POLITICAL (COMPRISING VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE), (II) ECONOMIC (INVOLVING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY) AND (III) INSTITUTIONAL (INCLUDING CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW). TEN DIMENSIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ARE CONSIDERED. TWO MAIN FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO THE NET EFFECTS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MOBILE PHONES AND GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS. THEY ARE (1) REDUCED COST OF BUSINESS START-UP PROCEDURE, THE TIME TO BUILD A WAREHOUSE AND THE TIME TO RESOLVE AN INSOLVENCY AND (2) INCREASED TIME TO ENFORCE A CONTRACT, TO REGISTER A PROPERTY AND TO PREPARE AND PAY TAXES. IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND POLICY ARE DISCUSSED. SOME OF THE ENGAGED POLICY IMPLICATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. (I) MEASURES ON HOW TO LEVERAGE ON THE POTENTIAL OF MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BY ADDRESSING CHALLENGE OF ACCESS TO AND AFFORDABILITY OF MOBILE PHONES ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IMPROVING ON THE ROLE OF THE MOBILE PHONE AS A PARTICIPATIVE INTERFACE BETWEEN EMERGING ENTREPRENEURS AND GOVERNANCE. (II) THE RELEVANCE OF THE MOBILE PHONE IN MITIGATING INFORMATION ASYMMETRY BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURS AND GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, NOTABLY BY: REDUCING GOVERNMENT INEFFICIENCY (WHICH POTENTIALLY REPRESENTS AN ADDITIONAL COST TO DOING BUSINESS) AND DECREASING INFORMATIONAL RENTS, BUREAUCRACY AND TRANSACTION COSTS.
634	CAPE TOWN CONVENTION THROUGH THE YEARS HAS BECOME A NEW STANDARD IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK. PARAGUAY, WITH A COMMERCIAL TERRITORY YET TO BE DISCOVERED, IS IN ITS PATH TOWARDS SIGNIFICANT ACTION. INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE HAS UNDERGONE STRATEGIC ACTIONS. THUS, WITHOUT PROPER REGULATIONS FOR THE PLAYING FIELD IN AN ERA OF GLOBALIZATION, CERTAIN BARRIERS WILL DRAG COMMERCIAL HARDSHIPS BOTH FOR LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS OPERATING IN PARAGUAY. THIS ARTICLE, WITH SLIGHT ECONOMIC EVIDENCE, TENDS TO MARK THE CURRENT STATUS IN COMMERCIAL FINANCING AND PERSUADE KEY OFFICIALS ON THE NEED FOR INCORPORATION OF THESE INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS. THE ADEQUACIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE SUGGESTED IN FORMAT THAT SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED FOR EVERY ELEMENT RETRIEVED FROM INTERVIEWS AND ACADEMIA. THE RULE OF LAW MEANS BETTER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND SAFE COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION. PARAGUAY HAS A SET OF PROPER REMEDIES AND PROCEDURAL ALTERNATIVES IN ORDER TO EXECUTE CONTRACTUAL MATTERS, GIVING A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF ENFORCEABILITY TO ITS LEGAL SECURITY. NEVERTHELESS-NO SURPRISE HERE-ITS SYSTEM IS NOT RISK PROOF, TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO LOCAL RECOGNITION OF AN INTERNATIONAL REGISTRY. IN THIS MATTER, THE TWO BIGGEST ASSETS THAT CAPETOWN CONVENTION MAY OFFER PARAGUAY ARE: A) THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL REGISTRY FOR THE FILING OF THE SECURITY INTEREST; AND B) UNIFORM REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT. LAST, THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO BE A LANDMARK INITIATIVE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPE TOWN CONVENTION AND PARAGUAY. IN AVIATION THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR NATIONALISM, NOT EVEN A SCIENTIFIC ONE. - HA WASSENBERGH, 'PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION LAW IN A NEW ERA'
635	HOW SHOULD COURTS HANDLE INTERPRETIVE CHOICES, SUCH AS WHEN STATUTORY TEXT STRONGLY POINTS TO ONE STATUTORY MEANING BUT STRONG EVIDENCE OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT SUGGESTS A CONTRADICTORY STATUTORY MEANING? COURTS HAVE ADDRESSED THIS LONGSTANDING DILEMMA INCONSISTENTLY. SOMETIMES COURTS FOLLOW STATUTORY TEXT OVER CONTRADICTORY LEGISLATIVE INTENT; SOMETIMES THEY DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THOUGH REACHING CONTRADICTORY CONCLUSIONS, MANY COURTS FACING INTERPRETIVE CHOICES HAVE ARGUED THAT THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION PROVIDES DEFINITIVE SOLUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE: THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION GENERATES, RATHER THAN RESOLVES, INTERPRETIVE CHOICES. WHEN THIS OCCURS, LEGALLY UNCONSTRAINED JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND EXTRALEGAL FACTORS, RATHER THAN THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION, DETERMINE LEGAL MEANING. WHILE OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SHAPING LEGAL MEANING, THEIR ANALYSES INVARIABLY HAVE CENTERED ON INHERENTLY AMBIGUOUS LEGAL TEXTS OR LEGISLATIVE HISTORIES. THIS ARTICLE, BY CONTRAST, DEMONSTRATES HOW, IN CASES OF INTERPRETIVE CHOICE, UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION TURN UNAMBIGUOUS LEGAL TEXTS AND LEGISLATIVE HISTORIES INTO AMBIGUOUS STATUTES. THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES HOW COURTS FACING INTERPRETIVE CHOICES MISREPRESENT THE NATURE AND CAPACITY OF THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION. RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGING THE CENTRAL ROLE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND EXTRALEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, COURTS ARGUE THAT THE LAW OF INTERPRETATION DEFINITIVELY RESOLVES INTERPRETIVE CHOICES. RULE-OF-LAW VALUES AND THE CONSONANT DESIRE TO PRESERVE THE LEGITIMACY OF JUDICIAL DECISIONMAKING PROMPT COURTS TO OPT FOR THIS OBFUSCATORY STRATEGY. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY-TRANSPARENT JUSTIFICATION-AND EXPLAINS WHY THE CASE IN FAVOR OF TRANSPARENT JUSTIFICATION IS MUCH STRONGER THAN MOST MIGHT IMAGINE.
636	THE INTENSE ETHNIC ASSERTION OF IDENTITY OFTEN TRANSLATED INTO VIOLENCE ETHNIC CLEANSING - CAN BE LARGELY EXPLAINED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CHALLENGE TO THE PROJECT OF MODERNITY (ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, JUSTICE, RULE OF LAW, THE MASS MEDIA, SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSPORT). ALTHOUGH ETHNIC CLEANSING ITSELF IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON, DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MASS MEDIA ALLOW IT TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN INFLUENCING PEOPLE IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF CULTURE ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. HATRED OF THE ENEMY, DEFINED SIMPLY IN ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS TERMS, IS HEIGHTENED THROUGH THE USE OF TELEVISION. HONOUR, GLORY, PAST MYTHOLOGY AND ETHNIC NATIONALISM ARE EXTOLLED, CREATING A PREDISPOSITION FOR EXTREME ARGUMENTS. RAPE OR SEXUAL INTIMIDATION IS EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED TO TERRORIZE AND HUMILIATE THE ETHNIC ENEMY AND EXPLAINS THE BITTERNESS AMONG COMBATANTS. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS ITS THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS. FIRST, ALL SUCH CRISES NEED TO BE LOOKED AT IN A GLOBAL FRAME, THOSE WHO SHARE THE RELIGION OR RACE OF THE VICTIMS OF ETHNIC INTOLERANCE IN ONE PART OF THE WORLD MAY BE THE AGGRESSORS IN ANOTHER. SECOND, WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DISCRETE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES ARE REDUNDANT. THIRD, WHILE WE NEED TO STUDY THE ETHNIC DEATH AND TORTURE CAMPS (LIKE THOSE IN THE BALKANS) WE MUST ALSO SPOT OTHER LESS OBVIOUS AND MORE SUBTLE BUT ALMOST EQUALLY TRAGIC FORMS OF ETHNIC CLEANSING RESULTING FROM RACISM AND IMMIGRATION POLICIES (AS IN WESTERN EUROPE), FINALLY, WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE FRAGMENTATION, NEW MUTATIONS, TRANSFORMATIONS, REVIVALISMS AND REVISIONS. THIS FRAGMENTATION IS BOTH CAUSE AND EFFECT OF ETHNIC REVIVALISM.
637	THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INFLUENCES RISK ALLOCATION IN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPS) PROJECTS IN AFRICA. THE ANALYSIS COVERS 396 ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PPP PROJECTS IN 35 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1990-2019 BASED ON THE WORLD BANK PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN INFRASTRUCTURE DATABASE AND THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. RISK IS MEASURED THROUGH CONTRACT CLASSIFICATION AND RELATES TO THE INCREASING PARTICIPATION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN MORE STRUCTURED FORMS OF PPPS, THAT IS, THE PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORTS HIGHER RISKS AS IT PARTICIPATES IN MORE STRUCTURED FORMS OF PPPS. FOR THAT PURPOSE, FOUR TYPES OF PPPS CONTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED: MANAGEMENT AND LEASES, BROWNFIELDS, GREENFIELDS, AND DIVESTITURES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, SOUND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, AND STRONG RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE RISK ALLOCATION BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS TOWARD THE PRIVATE ENTITY. CONVERSELY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT RISK ALLOCATION BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS ARE MUCH STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WITH GREATER EXPERIENCE IN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PPPS PROJECTS, SUGGESTING THAT IN ADDITION TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, PRIVATE INVESTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE INTERESTED IN TAKING MORE RISKS IN ENERGY PPPS PROJECTS IN EXPERIENCED COUNTRIES. WHILE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN AFRICAN LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT MORE RISKS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES COMPARED TO LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED AND DISCUSSED ACCORDINGLY.
638	THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES OF A LARGE DRUG ERADICATION MOVEMENT CALLED PAT JASAN IN NORTHERN MYANMAR. IT WILL OUTLINE THE DIFFERENT EVERYDAY JUSTICE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE IN THE MYANMAR BORDERLANDS TO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SEEKING TO PUSH FORWARD A ?SOLUTIONS FOCUSED? AGENDA TO MANAGE DRUG-RELATED SOCIAL PROBLEMS. THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL A RANGE OF STATUTORY, CUSTOMARY, AND QUASI-STATUTORY-CUSTOMARY LEGAL PROCESSES AND INSTRUMENTS. HOWEVER, A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF EVERYDAY JUSTICE HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES POSED IN THIS CONTESTED BORDERLAND CONCERNING HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THROUGH MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING AUTHORITIES. THE PAPER SHOWS HOW NOTIONS OF LEGITIMACY FOR DRUG RELATED LEGAL PROCESSES ARE CONSTRUCTED AND THE KEY ROLE OF BROKERS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHO ARE VITAL IN MANAGING THE DILEMMAS OF GOVERNANCE AND LEGAL ADMINISTRATION. IT ALSO TOUCHES UPON EMERGING INTERGENERATIONAL AND GENDERED TENSIONS THAT SERVE TO ORIENTATE IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES TOWARDS DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AS THESE SYSTEMS ARE NAVIGATED. THE COMPLEXITY AND SENSITIVITY OF THE LOCAL EVERYDAY JUSTICE SOCIAL FIELD CONTRASTS SHARPLY WITH THE DEBATES CONDUCTED ABOUT PAT JASAN AT A NATIONAL AND DRUGS POLICY REFORM LEVEL, IN WHICH THESE LOCAL ACTORS ARE MARGINALIZED AS DISRUPTIVE AND REACTIONARY FORCES THAT WORK ENTIRELY OUTSIDE THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER INVITES CONSIDERATION OF HOW NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DRUG POLICY ACTORS ENGAGE WITH SUCH SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS HOW CONCERNS ABOUT ILLICIT DRUG USE AND SUPPLY WITHIN LOCAL COMMUNITIES PROVIDES A HELPFUL TOOL OF ANALYSIS FOR UNDERSTANDING OTHER CRITICAL ISSUES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND PEACEBUILDING.
639	MOTIVATION: CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH REGRESSIONS INDICATE THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR GROWTH. SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE CREATED, PROTECTED AND ENFORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT - THEY ARE THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE. THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE: ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, POLITICAL FREEDOM (OR DEMOCRACY), QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. INSTITUTIONS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES. TWO QUESTIONS ARISE: WERE INSTITUTIONS IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS? AIM: THE AIM OF THE SECOND PART OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO VERIFY TWO HYPOTHESIS ABOUT INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES, WHICH WERE PUT FORWARD IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES DURING THE CRISIS, A CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSION WAS CONDUCTED. ADDITIONALLY THE GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: THE OBTAINED RESULTS INDICATE THAT DURING THE RECESSION, IN COUNTRIES WERE BEFORE THE CRISIS THE INSTITUTIONS WERE WORSE, THE PACE OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS GREATER (HYPOTHESIS 1 SHOULD BE REJECTED). IN ORDER TO VERIFY HYPOTHESIS 2 THAT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTRIBUTES TO CHANGES IN STATE INSTITUTIONS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FASTER THE PACE OF GROWTH THE GREATER THE IMPROVEMENT IN STATE INSTITUTIONS A CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSION WAS USED AND THE GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST WAS CONDUCTED. OBTAINED RESULTS DO NOT CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS 2. THE ESTIMATES OF PARAMETERS WERE IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTATIONS BUT STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT.
640	NOT ONLY IN OUR TURKISH LANGUAGE BUT ALSO IN THE OTHER LANGUAGES THERE ARE SEVERAL TERMS AND WORDS THAT MEANINGS DISABLED AND DISABILITY. IT IS ALSO USED DIFFERENT WORDS THAT MEANS THE DISABLED PEOPLE IN ARABIC. THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MUST HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS EVERY BODY. IT IS THE MOST NATURAL RIGHTS AS HUMAN BEINGS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FACING NUMEROUS CHALLENGES AND DIFFICULTIES IN THEIR DAILY LIVES BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE: THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY SUFFERED PERSONS SOME BREEDS SUCH BLACKS, AND JEWS, AND WOMEN, BELONGING TO RELIGIOUS GROUPS OR E.T.C. BY INJUSTICES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE PUBLICATIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE MAIN CAUSE OF DISABILITY FROM ANCIENT TIMES UNTIL THE 16TH AND 17TH CENTURIES, THE EVIL SPRITS THAT ARE CONSIDERED IN AROUND, DEMONS AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE NEGATIVE. SOME PHILOSOPHERS PUT FORWARD THAT IN THE RANKING LIVING BEINGS ALL OF THE EARTH, DISABILIES ARE AS SUBSTRATUM. IN THIS ARTICLE IT IS EXAMINED THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS OF THE SOCIETIES AGAINST TO THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE WILL BE FOUND THE POSSIBILITY AND OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A COMPARISON OF THOSE ATTITUDES WITH THE CURRENT POSITION OF THOSE BEHAVIORS TODAY. IN ADDITION IT IS DEALT WITH THE SOCIAL SITUATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABLED PEOPLE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE ANCIENT TIMES TO THE PRESENT DAY SPECIALLY SELJUK PERIOD AND ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION OF TODAY. WE WILL BE OFFERED SOME SOLUTIONS RELATED TO CURRENT PROBLEMS ABOUT THEM.
641	P>WE EXAMINE WHETHER INCREASED TRADE WITH COUNTRIES WITH INEFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SKILL-DEEPENING OF THE 1980S. WE CONSTRUCT AN INDEX OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, COMBINING DATA ON PROTECTION OF PATENTS AND RULE OF LAW. NEXT, WE CONSTRUCT AN INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC VERSION OF THIS INDEX, USING AS WEIGHTS EACH COUNTRY'S TRADE SHARE IN THE TOTAL TRADE OF THE INDUSTRY. WE FIND A DECLINE IN THIS TRADE-WEIGHTED INDEX, OWING TO A RISE IN TRADE WITH COUNTRIES WITH LOW EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH EXPLAINS 29% OF THE RISE IN WITHIN-INDUSTRY SKILL-INTENSITY.ON SE DEMANDE SI UN COMMERCE ACCRU AVEC DES PAYS QUI ONT UNE PROTECTION INEFFICACE DE LEUR PROPRIETE INTELLECTUELLE A CONTRIBUE A UNE DEMANDE DE TRAVAIL QUALIFIE ACCRUE DANS LES ANNEES 1980. ON CONSTRUIT UN INDICE DE LA PROTECTION EFFECTIVE DE LA PROPRIETE INTELLECTUELLE AU NIVEAU DU PAYS, COMBINANT DES DONNEES SUR LA PROTECTION DES BREVETS ET L'ETAT DE DROIT. ENSUITE, ON CONSTRUIT UNE VERSION DE CET INDICE AU NIVEAU DES INDUSTRIES SPECIFIQUES, UTILISANT COMME PONDERATION LES PARTS DU COMMERCE DE CHAQUE PAYS DANS LE COMMERCE TOTAL DE L'INDUSTRIE. ON NOTE UN DECLIN DANS CET INDICE PONDERE PAR L'IMPORTANCE DU COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL (ATTRIBUABLE A UN ACCROISSEMENT DU COMMERCE AVEC LES PAYS QUI ONT UNE PROTECTION EFFECTIVEMENT FAIBLE DE LA PROPRIETE INTELLECTUELLE) QUI EXPLIQUE 29% DE L'ACCROISSEMENT DANS L'INTENSITE DU TRAVAIL QUALIFIE A L'INTERIEUR DE L'INDUSTRIE.
642	BIOGAS AS ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE, IT'S BENEFIT AND OPPORTUNITIES OF USE IS REPRESENT IN THIS ARTICLE. ALSO THIS ARTICLE TAKES NOTICE TO INSPIRATIONS AND PROBLEMS OF REGULAR RAW MATERIAL SUPPLY OF BIOGAS PRODUCTION. APPOINTED THAT BIOGAS MAY BE USED AS INDUSTRY MATERIAL, ENERGY SOURCE OR FUEL FRIENDLY TO ENVIRONMENT. THERE ARE THESE POSSIBLE INSPIRATIONS (ASSUMPTIONS) OF BIOGAS PRODUCTION: POLITICAL (EU AND NATIONAL RULE OF LAW, KYOTO PROTOCOL); ENVIRONMENTAL (REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION); ENERGETIC (SUBSTITUTE FOR MINERAL FUEL; USE OF LOCAL ENERGY RESOURCES); TECHNOLOGICAL (CREATION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY MARKETPLACE); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOT FOOD PRODUCTION, NEW JOB-CREATION, EFFECTIVE USE OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE). AGRICULTURE (WASTE AND ENERGETIC PLANTS), INDUSTRY (ANIMAL AND PLANT ORIGIN) AND PLACE (SLUDGE AND FOOD GARBAGE) WASTE MAY BE USED FOR BIOGAS PRODUCTION. BY PRODUCING BIOGAS FOR COUNTRIES ENERGY SYSTEM IT IS CONFRONTED WITH PROBLEM OF REGULAR RAW MATERIAL SUPPLY FOR BIOGAS PLANT. WITH THE VIEW OF COMMODITY BIOGAS PLANTS USE AS ENERGY ALTERNATIVE, USING THE LONG-TERM EXPERIENCE OF OTHER COUNTRIES, NECESSARY TO UNSURE THE REGULAR AND UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIAL ALL YEAR LONG. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION, USING AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS FOR BIOGAS PLANTS - ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING ENERGY-POLICY MEETING AND THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY. IN ECONOMIC TERMS, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DEVELOP A BIOGAS PLANT INSTALLATION OF LARGER FARMS, BUT A RATIONAL CHOICE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE AREA OF BIOGAS DISTRIBUTION OF RAW MATERIALS AND FOOD PRODUCTS.
643	THE KNESSET HAS RECENTLY AMENDED BASIC LAW: THE JUDICIARY TO ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF THE COURTS TO ISSUE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY OF ITS MINISTERS BASED ON THE REASONABLENESS OF THEIR DECISIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THIS AMENDMENT FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. THE FIRST SECTION POSITS THE AMENDMENT AS PART OF A LARGER PLAN OF THE COALITION TO ELIMINATE JUDICIAL REVIEW AND PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT WITH UNLIMITED POWER. THE SECOND SECTION EMPHASISES THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS LEGISLATED BY THE KNESSET FOR ITSELF, RAISING CONCERN OVER A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD IN ISRAELI LAW, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE DUTY TO ACT REASONABLY, WHICH STEMS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE NEXT TWO SECTIONS ASSESS THE MANY RISKS THAT THE AMENDMENT CREATES, SUCH AS THE TYPES OF DECISION THAT COULD BE MADE WITHOUT ADHERING TO A STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS, AND THE TRIMMING OF THE POWER OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS A LEGAL 'GATEKEEPER'. SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE DANGERS THAT THE AMENDMENT HOLDS FOR THE QUALITY AND DIVERSITY OF THE CIVIL SERVICE. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MULTIPLE REASONS WHY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE IMMUNE FROM A REASONABLENESS CHECK AND TACKLES THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE USE OF THE STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS BY THE COURTS.THIS MULTIFACETED ANALYSIS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ELIMINATION OF THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD UNDERMINES BASIC FEATURES OF DEMOCRACY AND FRACTURES THE SOCIAL CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITIZENS AND THE GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, IT SHOULD NOT BE IMMUNE FROM JUDICIAL REVIEW.
644	WHAT ROLE HAVE THE COURTS PLAYED DURING THE PANDEMIC? HOW DIFFERENT HAS THIS ROLE BEEN ACROSS THE GLOBE? CAN LESSONS FOR A BETTER RESPONSE TO HEALTH CRISES AND EMERGENCIES BE LEARNED FROM LITIGATION? STARTING FROM THESE QUESTIONS, THE AUTHORS PRESENT THE MAIN FINDINGS OF AN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT ON COVID-19 LITIGATION AIMED AT COLLECTING AND COMPARING CASELAW, WITHIN AN OPENLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE, FROM MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES ON ALL CONTINENTS, CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES UPON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS COMPAR-ATIVE ANALYSIS, BASED ON A SET OF AROUND 2000 DECISIONS FROM 2020-2022, SHOWS THAT, ALTHOUGH COURTS HAVE FACED VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES, DISTINCT LEGAL TRADITIONS HAVE LED JUDGES TO USE DIFFERENT BALANCING TECHNIQUES WITH DIFFERENT OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC POWERS AND AVAILABLE REMEDIES. ACTIONS AND OMISSIONS HAVE BEEN DIF-FERENTLY ADDRESSED AND THE EVOLUTION OF SCIENCE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED JUDICIAL RE-VIEW. AREAS OF LITIGATION HAVE CHANGED OVERTIME, MIRRORING THE EVOLUTION OF THE PAN-DEMIC AND THE MODIFICATIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL STRATEGIES. MORE RECENTLY, LIABILITY CLAIMS ARE EMERGING AND WILL PROBABLY GROW IN THE NEAR FUTURE, OFFERING COURTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD A FURTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF GOVERNMENTS, REVISITED THROUGH THE LENSES OF COVID-19 LITIGATION, SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS, AND POLICY MAKERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON THIS HERITAGE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING A BETTER RESPONSE TO FUTURE HEALTH EMERGENCIES THAT FULLY RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
645	REDUCING INCOME INEQUALITY IS A CRUCIAL GOAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS INCOME INEQUALITY OFTEN VIEWED AS HARMFUL TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO EMPIRICALLY ASSESS THE MACROECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS OF INCOME INEQUALITY IN AFRICA. WE USE A KUZNETS CURVE FRAMEWORK, WHICH EMPHASISES THE ROLE OF INCOME PER CAPITA IN EXPLAINING THE TIME PATH OF INEQUALITY. IN CONTRAST TO MUCH OF THE LITERATURE, WE EXPLICITLY EXAMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE INCOME STEADY STATES. USING THE CONCEPT OF CLUBS OF CONVERGENCE, WE SHOW THAT PER CAPITA INCOME IS DIVERGENT AND IDENTIFY FOUR STEADY STATES TO WHICH GROUPS OF ECONOMIES CONVERGE (I.E., HIGH-INCOME TO LOW-INCOME ECONOMIES). USING PANEL DATA MODELS AND A DATA SET ENCOMPASSING 52 AFRICAN COUNTRIES SPANNING THE YEARS 1980-2017, WE SHOW THAT ONCE THESE MULTIPLE STEADY STATES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR, THE KUZNETS CURVE RELATIONSHIP BECOMES UNSTABLE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INEQUALITY MAY BE INCREASING IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, WHILE DECREASING IN LOW-INCOME OR THE LEAST DEVELOPED ECONOMIES. IN ADDITION, THE ROLE OF MACROECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN EXPLAINING INCOME INEQUALITY IS LIMITED AND DIFFER ACROSS CONVERGENCE CLUBS. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF FISCAL, EMPLOYMENT AND MONETARY POLICIES AND THE RULE OF LAW TO TACKLE INEQUALITY IN HIGH-INCOME ECONOMIES, WHILE THEY HAVE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LOW-INCOME ECONOMIES' INCOME INEQUALITY.

646	THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR THE LOCATION OF VICTIMHOOD RATHER THAN POLITICAL CONVENIENCE AT THE CENTRE OF ZIMBABWE'S PEACE-BUILDING MATRIX. FROM THE ATTAINMENT OF INDEPENDENCE IN 1980 TO THE MILITARY ASSISTED END OF PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE'S RULE IN NOVEMBER 2017, ZIMBABWE'S EPISODIC CYCLES OF VIOLENCE WERE CONCLUDED THROUGH ELITE BARGAINED AMNESTY ORDINANCES, STATE MEDIATED RECONCILIATION PRONOUNCEMENTS AND CLEMENCY ORDERS THAT UNCONDITIONALLY BENEFITTED PERPETRATORS AT THE EXPENSE OF VICTIMS. THE FORGIVE-AND-FORGET ETHIC CENTRAL TO THESE ROUTINE AND FRACTIONAL PEACE BUILDING MEASURES, I ARGUE, NOT ONLY DISREGARDED THE RULE OF LAW BUT NEGATED VICTIMHOOD AND RENDERED JUSTICE DIVISIBLE. VICTIMS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE COULD NOT SECURE REDRESS THROUGH THE COURTS OF LAW AGAINST AMNESTIED PERPETRATORS AS THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO DOUBLE JEOPARDY. THE GOVERNMENT WITHHELD PROSECUTORIAL JUSTICE AGAINST PERPETRATORS AND DISREGARDED REPARATIONS FOR VICTIMS. WITHIN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK ORDINARY LEGISLATORS COULD NOT MOVE MOTIONS COMPELLING THE GOVERNMENT TO COMPENSATE SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE BECAUSE ONLY THE VICE-PRESIDENTS AND MINISTERS COULD MOVE MOTIONS THAT HAD THE CONSEQUENCE OF EITHER DEPLETING STATE REVENUES OR CAUSING THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL TAXES ON CITIZENS. CONSIDERING THAT MINISTERS WHO HAD THE PREROGATIVE TO MOVE SUCH MOTIONS SERVED IN CABINET AT THE BEHEST OF THEIR INTRACTABLE PRESIDENT THEY COULD HARDLY EMBARRASS OR CONTRADICT THEIR PRINCIPAL. ESSENTIALLY, THE ROBERT MUGABE LED ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED LEGAL FIREWALLS FOR PERPETRATORS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE WHICH IPSO FACTO INVALIDATED THE QUEST FOR JUSTICE BY VICTIMS OF THE COUNTRY'S EVER RECURRING CYCLES OF VIOLENCE. THIS AUTHORITARIAN LEGALISM DISREGARDED VICTIMHOOD AND EMBOLDENED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATORS.
647	OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF PROTECTING PERSONS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DETERMINING THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS APPLICATION IN UKRAINE. FOR THE ABOVE, WE USED THE ANALYTICAL METHOD AND THE DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS TO TRACK THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STATE OF PROTECTING PERSONS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. RELEVANT ISSUES RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATUTORY METHODS OF PROTECTING PERSONS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND RECOGNITION IN THIS RESEARCH PLATFORM. THE EXPERIENCE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN THE FIELD OF PROTECTING PERSONS DURING THEIR RELATIONS WITH PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAS BEEN STUDIED; THE POSSIBILITIES OF ITS APPLICATION IN UKRAINE HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. IT HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED THAT THE ABILITY OF ANY PERSON TO USE THE LEGALLY DEFINED TOOLS OF LEGAL PROTECTION IS ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT ONLY A COUNTRY WHOSE STATE POWER PERFORMS ITS DIRECT FUNCTIONS ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT HARMING THE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS, CAN BE TRULY CONSIDERED LEGAL AND DEMOCRATIC. SCIENTIFIC POINTS OF VIEW ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGALLY DEFINED PROCEDURES FOR THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND COMPARED. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF EFFECTIVE METHODS AND MEANS OF PROTECTION OF PERSONS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF STATE AUTHORITY'S ACTIVITY, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF UKRAINE'S EUROPEAN INTEGRATION COURSE.
648	THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF RESPONSES TO THE SO-CALLED PHENOMENON OF "FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS," AND THE PROFOUND HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES THEY GIVE RISE TO. IT CONSIDERS NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS, MANY SPURRED BY AN ACTIVIST SECURITY COUNCIL, THROUGH WHICH EXPANDED POWERS HAVE BEEN ASSUMED AND RIGHTS RESTRICTED BY REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO RESPOND TO FTF THREATS. A SERIES OF UNCOMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIPS EMERGE FROM THIS ANALYSIS. THEY INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE TENSIONS: BETWEEN THE EVOLVING AND STILL RELATIVELY SUPERFICIAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE AND SOURCE OF UNCERTAIN THREATS AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE ONEROUS AND FAR-REACHING NATURE OF RESPONSES DIRECTED AGAINST THEM ON THE OTHER; BETWEEN THE EXPANSIVE USE OF COERCIVE MEASURES INCLUDING CRIMINAL LAW, AND BASIC CONSTRAINING PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW UPON WHICH ITS LEGITIMACY AND POWER DEPENDS, SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL CULPABILITY, HARM PRINCIPLE AND REMOTENESS; OR BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PURPOSES OF MOST FTF MEASURES AND THEIR IMPACT IN PRACTICE, ON THE OPERATION OF HUMANITARIAN LAW, ON HUMANITARIAN WORKERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS, AND ON THE RULE OF LAW. EXCEPTIONAL FTF MEASURES CONTINUE TO SPREAD THEIR REACH AND CREEP INTO OTHER AREAS OF SECURITY AND ORGANISED CRIME. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE SHORT AND LONG TERM IMPACT, ON THE FULL RANGE OF RIGHTS OF MANY, OF THE ARRAY OF ADMINISTRATIVE, CRIMINAL AND OTHER MEASURES BEING PASSED INTO LAW AND IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE ACROSS THE GLOBE IN THE NAME OF RESPONDING TO THE ILL-DEFINED PHENOMENON OF "FTFS".
649	RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLISH STATE AND MUSLIMS LIVING IN ITS TERRITORY HAVE A LONG HISTORY DATING BACK TO THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY, WHEN A MUSLIM PRESENCE WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN THE AREA. THE FIRST MUSLIMS TO ARRIVE IN POLAND WERE TATARS FROM THE GOLDEN HORDE. THEIR INFLUX CONTINUED FOR A FEW CENTURIES AND THEY WERE GRANTED LAND IN EXCHANGE FOR MILITARY SERVICE. THE NATURE OF MUTUAL RELATIONS CHANGED WITH TIME, ALONG WITH CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE. INITIALLY, THERE WAS A POLISH-LITHUANIAN MONARCHY, BUT AFTER 1795 THE AREA INHABITED BY THE TATARS FELL UNDER THE RULE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE. IN 1918-1939, THE REBORN POLISH STATE GRANTED ITS INHABITANTS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND, EVEN THOUGH CATHOLICISM WAS PRIVILEGED, ISLAM WAS OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED IN 1936. THE SOCIALIST STATE, IN EXISTENCE BETWEEN 1944 AND 1989, TOOK AN IDEOLOGICAL STANCE AGAINST ALL RELIGIONS. SINCE 1989, POLAND HAS BEEN A DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW CHARACTERIZED BY SEPARATION OF STATE AND RELIGION. THANKS TO THE CENTURIES-LONG PRESENCE OF TATARS IN POLAND, ISLAM IS AN OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED DENOMINATION AND THE POSITION OF MUSLIMS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT OF OTHER RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. THIS ARTICLE DETAILS THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLISH STATE AND MUSLIMS. THE SECTION ON THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND RELIGION AND A DESCRIPTION OF ISLAM-RELATED LEGISLATION IN THE CONSTITUTION AND RELIGIOUS LAW, FOCUSING ON REGULATIONS CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PRACTICES INCLUDING MARRIAGE, DRESS CODE, RITUAL SLAUGHTER AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOL.
650	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: THE PROHIBITION OF USING, DISPENSING OR DISTRIBUTING ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AT WORKPLACES INVOLVING AN ELEVATED RISK OF ACCIDENTS (ART. 15 - LAW 125/2001 "GENERAL POLICY CONCERNING ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOL-RELATED PROBLEMS') IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DUTIES OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES REGULATED BY DECREE 626/94. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RULE OF LAW IS THE HEALTH PROTECTION OF WORKERS AND OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN THE WORKPLACE. ALCOHOL-ADDICTION IN WORKERS HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND, IN THE CASE OF THE HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE LAW, THE INCREASE IN RISK DUE TO ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ALONG WITH THE PROHIBITION OF DISPENSING OR DISTRIBUTING ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AT THE WORKPLACE, COMPANIES CAN LAUNCH TRAINING AND INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS ON THE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS RESULTING FROM BY HARMFUL AND HAZARDOUS ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IN WORKPLACES, WHICH WILL BE ALL THE MORE EFFECTIVE IF ADDRESSED TO ALL WORKERS AND NOT ONLY TO THE MORE EXPOSED EMPLOYEES. IN DEVELOPING THIS ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PHYSICIAN HAS A CENTRAL ROLE TO PLAY BY GIVING ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYEES, INVOLVING THE MANAGEMENT AND COOPERATING WITH PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THE CONTROLLING BODY WILL PROMOTE, SUPPORT AND SUPERVISE THIS PROCESS. 1 PARTICULAR, THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (PSAL), TOGETHER WITH SOCIAL PARTNERS, WILL ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO START UP PROJECTS FOR HEALTH PROTECTION, WILL FACILITATE COOPERATION WITH THE PATHOLOGICAL ADDICTION SERVICES (SER T), AND WILL ENCOURAGE THE IMPLEMENTATION OFA NETWORK TOFACILITATE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PHYSICIANS IN ANALYZING ACCIDENT RISKS ANDSOLVING HEALTH PROBLEMS RELATED TO ALCOHOL ABUSE.
651	THE OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC, MILITARY CONFLICTS AND POLITICAL MAELSTROM HAVE CHANGED THE CONSTELLATION OF THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT, GENERATING A NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN IGNORANCE, DISINFORMATION, AND MANIPULATION RESULTING IN FAKE NEWS, CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND HATE SPEECH. THE PHENOMENA ARE ESCALATED AND INTENSIFIED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS, WIDESPREAD DIGITISATION AND ITS IMPACT ON ALL AREAS OF LIFE, ESPECIALLY POLITICAL ACTIVITY. DUE TO THE CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION, A NEW SOCIAL FORMATION HAS EMERGED, KNOWN AS THE INFORMATION SOCIETY, REPRESENTED NOT ONLY BY POLITICIANS AND SOCIAL ACTIVISTS. THE MODIFIED ARCHITECTURE OF DIGITAL SPACE CAUSES THE FORMATION OF NEW INSTRUMENTS, INFLUENCE FACTORS, AND HARMFUL SOCIAL PHENOMENA - PREVIOUSLY PRESENT AND RECOGNISED BUT NEVER BEFORE SO INTENSE. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES AND ANALYSES THE ISSUE OF IGNORANCE, MISINFORMATION, DISINFORMATION AND MANIPULATION AS POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL TOOLS OF POLITICAL POWER AND TERRORISM. THE STUDY ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF DISINFORMATION, MANIPULATION AND HATE SPEECH DISSEMINATED THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND ABUSED BY POLITICIANS WHO USE IT TO BUILD AND EXTEND POLITICAL POWER. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THESE DETRIMENTAL AND INJURIOUS PHENOMENA ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE DEFINES THE TERMS IGNORANCE, MISINFORMATION AND MANIPULATION, PROVING THAT A LANGUAGE, AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, SHOULD BE NEUTRAL BUT IS ACTUALLY USED FOR PROMOTING IDEOLOGY, COMING TO POWER, SERVING HATRED AND VIOLENCE, AND INCITING CRIMINAL ACTS AND CRIMES. THUS, WORLDWIDE POLITICAL PLAYERS USE LANGUAGE AND MEDIA TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE, SPREAD FALSE IDEOLOGIES, AND IMPROVE THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE.
652	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAW-MAKING ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY OF CONVICTS SERVING SENTENCES IN PLACES OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY. MAIN ATTENTION IS PAID TO ISSUES OF PRESERVING TRADITIONAL SPIRITUAL AND MORAL VALUES IN THE PROCESS OF PUNISHMENT, AND ACHIEVING CORRECTION OF CONVICTS IN TERMS OF FORMING RESPECT FOR THE RULES AND TRADITIONS OF HUMAN COMMUNITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOGNIZING HUMAN DIGNITY FOR DETERMINING THE DIRECTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FORMATION OF LAW-ABIDING BEHAVIOR OF CONVICTS IS NOTED. THE PROBLEMS OF THE INFLUENCE OF CRIMINAL IDEOLOGY ON THE PROCESS OF SERVING A SENTENCE, AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF NAZI PARAPHERNALIA AND SYMBOLS, ARE ANALYZED IN PARTICULAR. BASED ON THE STUDY OF TRENDS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL INTERPRETATION, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE VALIDITY OF THE INTRODUCTION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR PUBLIC JUSTIFICATION OR PROPAGANDA OF EXTREMISM WAS CARRIED OUT. A DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SPREAD OF CRIMINAL EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY IN PLACES OF DETENTION REFLECTS TWO MAIN DANGERS: THE UNSPOKEN STRATIFICATION AND CASTE SYSTEM AMONG CONVICTS IS AGGRAVATED, WHICH IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME IN THE PROCESS OF RE-SOCIALIZATION;, AND SECULAR CULTURE ABSORBS CRIMINAL TRADITIONS ALMOST UNHINDERED, TAKING AND " BEING INFECTED" WITH MARKERS OF PRISON SUBCULTURES. THE EXPANSION OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SPHERE OF COUNTERING THE SPREAD OF THE IDEOLOGY OF EXTREMISM ASSOCIATED WITH THREATS TO STATE AND PUBLIC SECURITY, HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH, PUBLIC ORDER AND THE WELL-BEING OF CITIZENS IS SEEN AS A PROMISING DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.
653	IN ALL STATES GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUBJECT TO THE LAW AND SUPERVISION BY THE COURTS ON THE SAME BASIS AS ANY INDIVIDUAL/CITIZEN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW. THE AUTHOR ONLY REPRESENTS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CONCERNING CONTROL OVER ADMINISTRATION, WHICH SUPERVISE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS RATIFIED THE RESPECTIVE INSTRUMENTS. THEREFORE, THE RATIFICATION AND INCORPORATION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMATIVE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FORM OF CONVENTIONS, SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN THE NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, IMPOSE THE OBLIGATION FOR A CERTAIN STATE TO RESPECT OR PROTECT THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED BY THE RESPECTIVE CONVENTION, AS WELL AS THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND PROPER APPLICATION OF THE CONVENTION, THE RELEVANT EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASE-LAW SETTING STANDARDS FOR ASSESSING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. HENCE, THIS CASE LAW SHOULD ACT AS A GUIDELINE FOR IMPROVING LEGAL REGULATIONS AND, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AVOIDING THE INITIATION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE BEFORE COMPETENT NATIONAL COURTS, IF OBJECTIVELY POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, DUE TO CERTAIN REASONS WHICH WILL BE ELABORATED UPON IN THIS PAPER, SOME DEVIATIONS CAN OCCUR AND, FOR THAT MATTER, JUDICIAL REVIEW MEANS REVIEW BY COURTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WITH A VIEW TO ENSURING THEIR LEGALITY AS WELL AS PROVIDING THE PROTECTION AND REALIZATION OF THE RIGHTS AND LEGAL INTERESTS OF CITIZENS IN THE SPHERE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
654	THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) NETWORK OF NATURE CONSERVATION AREAS - NATURA 2000 - COVERS ALMOST 18% OF EU TERRITORY, AND IS SUBJECT TO STRICT LEGAL PROTECTION, WHICH IS ENFORCED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, A SUPRANATIONAL AUTHORITY. GIVEN THE NATURA 2000 NETWORK'S SIZE, CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATURA 2000 AND RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS ARE INEVITABLE, PARTICULARLY AS COUNTRIES PUSH TO MEET THEIR 2020 ENERGY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS BY PURSUING MORE - AND LARGER - RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. FOCUSING ON TWO CASES IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR - A HYDROELECTRIC DAM IN PORTUGAL'S SABOR VALLEY, AND A LARGE TIDAL BARRAGE IN THE UK'S SEVERN ESTUARY - THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE EU'S STRICT BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION REGIME COULD NECESSITATE THE REJECTION OF MANY LARGE RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. THAT IS, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE AS A MATTER OF EU LAW FOR NATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO GRANT PERMISSION FOR SUCH PROJECTS. THE POTENTIAL FOR SUCH DIFFICULTIES WILL BE SHOWN TO BE HIGHLY VISIBLE TO POLICYMAKERS, AND COULD, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, TRIGGER NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACKS ON NATURE CONSERVATION POLICIES IN THE EU AND, BY WAY OF PRECEDENT, GLOBALLY. THE LEGAL ISSUES PRESENTED HERE SHOULD NOT, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, BE REGARDED AS INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS, NOR AS A TRIGGER FOR REFORMS AIMED AT WEAKENING BIODIVERSITY PROTECTIONS. RATHER, THESE ISSUES ARE BETTER REGARDED AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AN OPEN, INFORMED, GLOBAL DEBATE REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES, AND THE HIERARCHY, IF ANY, BETWEEN THEM.

655	SINCE A PEACE TREATY IN 2016, COLOMBIA HAS FACED A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO REDUCE POVERTY AND STRENGTHEN ITS INSTITUTIONS. A FEW STUDIES HAVE ANALYZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND SUBJECTIVE POVERTY, BUT NONE HAS DEMONSTRATED THIS INFLUENCE IN THE COLOMBIAN CONTEXT AT A MUNICIPAL LEVEL. THIS ARTICLE ESTIMATED A LOGIT REGRESSION INCLUDING A CLUSTER EFFECT TO EVIDENCE THE INFLUENCE OF MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS OVER PERCEPTIONS OF POVERTY BY THE INHABITANTS OF TWELVE MAIN CITIES IN COLOMBIA IN 2016. FINDINGS INCLUDE THAT HAVING A BETTER RULE OF LAW AND FISCAL PERFORMANCE, REDUCING POLITICAL FRAGMENTATION TO HAVE BETTER GOVERNANCE, GUARANTEEING PROPERTY RIGHTS, FOSTERING THE BENEFITS OF METROPOLITAN AREAS, AND IMPROVING CITIZEN PARTICIPATION REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF FEELING POOR. RESUMENDESDE EL TRATADO DE PAZ EN EL ANO 2016, COLOMBIA HA ENFRENTADO UN DESAFIO IMPORTANTE PARA REDUCIR LA POBREZA Y FORTALECER SUS INSTITUCIONES. SON POCOS LOS ESTUDIOS QUE ANALIZAN LA RELACION ENTRE INSTITUCIONES Y POBREZA SUBJETIVA, Y NINGUNO DE ELLOS DEMUESTRA ESTA INFLUENCIA EN EL CONTEXTO COLOMBIANO A NIVEL MUNICIPAL. POR ELLO, ESTE TRABAJO ESTIMO UNA REGRESION LOGIT CON EFECTO CLUSTER PARA EVIDENCIAR LA INFLUENCIA DE LAS INSTITUCIONES MUNICIPALES SOBRE LA PERCEPCION DE POBREZA DE LOS HABITANTES DE DOCE CIUDADES PRINCIPALES DE COLOMBIA EN EL ANO 2016. ESTA INVESTIGACION ENCONTRO QUE TENER UN MEJOR IMPERIO DE LA LEY Y DESEMPENO FISCAL, REDUCIR LA FRAGMENTACION POLITICA PARA TENER UNA MEJOR GOBERNABILIDAD, GARANTIZAR LOS DERECHOS DE PROPIEDAD, FOMENTAR LOS BENEFICIOS DE LAS AREAS METROPOLITANAS Y MEJORAR LA PARTICIPACION CIUDADANA REDUCEN LA PROBABILIDAD DE SENTIRSE POBRE.
656	THIS WORK DISCUSSES WHETHER EMERGING RIGHTS HAVE THE NATURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH, FROM DOGMATIC AND FORMALIST PERSPECTIVES, COULD BE AN OBSTACLE TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. IN THIS SENSE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ANALYZE THE INTERPRETATIVE AND ARGUMENTATIVE METHODO-LOGIES USED BY THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO CONCRETIZE THE LEGAL SCOPE OF NEW RIGHTS TO CHANNEL THEIR JUSTICIABILITY AND MATERIALIZATION. METHODOLOGICALLY, THIS IS LEGAL RESEARCH, CONDUCTED FROM THE QUALITA-TIVE PARADIGM, OF AN EXPLANATORY TYPE, BY MEANS OF A BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW. REGARDING THE RESULTS, THE RESEARCH REVEALED THAT ALTHOUGH EMERGING RIGHTS FACE DIFFICULTIES IN TERMS OF THEIR FOUNDATION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CONSENSUS ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE THE CHARACTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE SPECIFICITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION, GUIDED IN A DECISIVE WAY BY THE POLITICAL POSTULATE OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, THE VALUES OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND MATERIAL JUSTICE IN HARMONY WITH THE RHETORICAL AND DIALOGIC APPROACHES TO ARGUMENTATION, CONSTITUTE VITAL TOOLS FOR THEIR RECOGNITION AS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIS WORK CON-TRIBUTES NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE IN THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF EMERGING RIGHTS, BUT ALSO TO MAKE VIABLE THE DETERMINATION OF THEIR CONTENTS FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE HERMENEUTIC AND ARGUMENTATIVE ACTIVITY OF CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN CONCLUSION, IT CAN ARGUE THAT THE SPECIAL NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION COMBINED WITH THE AFORE MENTIONED ARGUMENTATIVE APPROACHES MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF PROTECTION OF RIGHTS BASED ON THE RE-SIGNIFICATION OF THE VALUES THAT SUPPORT THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
657	THE EMERGING TREND OF USING AI, BIG DATA, AND SMART CONTRACTS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OPENS RELEVANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN THE THEORY OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW. HOW TO PRESERVE THE OPEN TEXTURE OF THE LAW WHEN IT IS CODIFIED? HOW TO GUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LAWMAKING PROCESS IN THE DIGITAL DOCUMENT FLOW? HOW TO PRESERVE THE AUTONOMY OF THE DECISION-MAKER IF THE LAW IS AUTOMATED USING AI? AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, WE CANNOT IGNORE THE UNDENIABLE BENEFITS THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AFFORD IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION, IMPROVING THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, CHECKING THE COMPLIANCE OF APPLICATIONS, AND WORKING TOWARD A BETTER SOCIETY. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION (LAW AS PLATFORM, OR HYPERMODELEX) FOR DEFINING A THEORETICAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK (SMART LEGAL ORDER) THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE BENEFITS OF THE EMERGING AI TECHNOLOGIES IN A GOOD BALANCE WITH THE COMPUTATIONAL-LAW PARADIGM AND THE THEORY OF LAW. IN THE DIGITAL SOCIETY WE NEED MACHINE-COMPUTABLE LAW TO USE LEGAL KNOWLEDGE MIXED WITH OTHER IMPORTANT ARTEFACTS OF THE INFOSPHERE (E.G., APPS, THE WEB, SENSORS). IN MEANTIME WE DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE CONTROL OF AUTONOMY (THE HUMAN-INCOMMAND) IN A SECTOR AS IMPORTANT AS THE LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM. THIS RESEARCH INTENDS TO USE THE HYBRID AI APPROACH WHERE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO MITIGATING WEAKNESSES OF EACH SPECIFIC METHOD (DATA-DRIVEN VS. CODE-DRIVEN). ADDITIONALLY, THE HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION METHODOLOGY COULD HELP TOWARD DESIGNING A DIALOGIC MODEL FOR MAKING SURE THE OVERALL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS TRANSPARENT AND EXPLICABLE.
658	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RISE OF GERMANY FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO EXPLAIN THAT IT IS OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE, AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING RELATED TO THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RESOURCE ACCUMULATION THAT DETERMINE ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THE CASE OF GERMANY IS NOT VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE LOGIC OF THE OPEN ACCESS ORDERS OF NORTH ET AL. OR THE THEORY OF EXTRACTIVE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF ACEMOGLU AND ROBINSON ALONG THE LINE OF CONTESTATION AND INCLUSIVENESS. THE CASE OF GERMANY IS, HOWEVER, ABLE TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH OF PRZEWORSKI AND LIMONGI THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO SUSTAIN DEMOCRACY. GERMANY IS CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY CASE IN EXPLAINING THAT STABLE DEMOCRACY IS NOT THE CAUSE BUT RATHER THE CONSEQUENCE OR OUTCOME OF LENGTHY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE FROM SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN SIMILARLY SUPPORTS THE POSITION THAT DEMOCRACY IS THE OUTCOME OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT EXAMINE WHETHER WESTERN VALUES OF HUMAN EQUALITY AND HUMAN FREEDOM ARE ESSENTIAL IN ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE SO AS HUMAN EQUALITY IS THE PRECONDITION OF OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND HUMAN FREEDOM IS CLOSELY INTEGRATED WITH THE INTERCONNECTED INSTITUTIONS EXAMINED IN THIS ARTICLE. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY INVESTIGATE THE ROLES OF THESE VALUES IN DIFFERENT POLITICAL SYSTEMS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A POLITICAL SYSTEM IS UNDER THE RULE OF ONE PARTY, BY A DOMINANT PARTY, OR THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF A MULTIPARTY SYSTEM.
659	IN THE TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDING, THE SOCIAL BASIS OF THE EMERGENCE AND EXISTENCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN BE SUMMED UP AS AN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY IN WHICH INTERSTATE CONFLICT AND COOPERATION AND INTERESTS AND CONTRADICTIONS COEXIST. IN RECENT YEARS, THE TERM "INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY" HAS BEEN WIDELY USED IN NATIONAL PRACTICE AND ACADEMIC DISCOURSE. MANY SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERSTATE RELATIONS INDICATES THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS BEING TRANSFORMED INTO A GLOBAL INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE CONCEPT OF "A COMMUNITY OF SHARED FUTURE FOR MANKIND" REFLECTS CHINA'S NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT INTRODUCES CHINESE TRADITIONAL CULTURE INTO GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, DEVELOPS MARXIST THEORY ON THE COMMUNITY, IS CONCERNED BOTH FOR MANKIND AS A WHOLE AND FOR INDIVIDUALS, HIGHLIGHTS THE ULTIMATE ISSUES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, AND EMPHASIZES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S UNION OF DIVERSITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE. THE IDEA OF "A COMMUNITY OF SHARED FUTURE FOR MANKIND" IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, IT REFLECTS THE EMERGENCE OF METHODOLOGICAL HOLISM, THE RESPONSE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW TO THE QUESTIONING OF ITS LEGITIMACY, AND THE TREND TOWARD HIERARCHICAL SYSTEMATIZATION IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE CONCEPT OF "A COMMUNITY OF SHARED FUTURE FOR MANKIND" IS OF GREAT VALUE TO CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE REFORM OF THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. IT WILL HELP PROMOTE APPRECIATION OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WORLD, ENHANCE CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSE POWER AND DISCOURSE FORCE, AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THAT CHINA ADVOCATES.
660	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ISSUE OF CONFLICT IN THE HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY. IN THIS CONTEXT, ENCOMPASSES DIFFERENT PERIODS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY. ANALYZED CONCEPTS OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE AND ARGUES THAT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY OF THE CONFLICT BASED ON A SYNTHESIS OF THE MYTHOLOGICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS, ON IDEAS ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF HARMONY IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF MAN WITH NATURE AND JUSTICE SOCIAL POLICY IN THE STATE. THE CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION IN SOCIETY SEEN IN THE VIOLATION OF THIS BALANCE. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE UNDERSTANDING OF CONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PECULIARITIES OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THIS VIEW WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE OPPOSITION OF SOUL AND BODY, TEACHING ON THE SINFUL HUMAN NATURE. THIS PHILOSOPHY CAN BE DEFINED AS THE CONCEPT OF INTRAPERSONAL CONFLICTS, WHICH REQUIRED APPROPRIATE PRACTICES TO OVERCOME CONFLICTS. ALSO ANALYZED THE CONCEPT OF CONFLICT IN THIS NEW TIME, EVEN IN THE ERA OF MODERNIZATION. IN PARTICULAR, ANALYZED THE PHILOSOPHY OF LOCKE, KANT, D.S. MILL, HEGEL AND MARX, AND THE CONCEPTS OF CONFLICT G. SIMMEL, L. KOZER, R. DAHRENDORF. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RATIONALISTIC PHILOSOPHY OF MAN AND ETHICS OF EGOISM LARGELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THEORY OF PERSONALITY IN WHICH THE INCONSISTENCY OF ITS NATURE IS SEEN AS NATURAL AND POSITIVE AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY. THE CONCEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, REFLECTED A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE CONFLICT.
661	POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, FORMALLY AND MATERIALLY. THE SPECIAL PROTECTION CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE, BUT, EQUALLY, THE RIGHT TO BE VOTED. ELIGIBILITY IS SKETCHED FROM CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FIELD, BESIDES THE NORMATIVE COMMAND TO THE LEGISLATOR TO, IN PROTECTION OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS MENTIONED IN ARTICLE 14, 9, COMPLETE THE SYSTEM OF CONSTRAINTS WITH OTHER CASES OF INELIGIBILITY. THIS CAN NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, AN AUTHORIZATION TO IGNORE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE PROFOUND CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF INELIGIBILITY BY THE COMPLEMENTARY LAW N DEGREES 135/10. TO DEMONSTRATE THE WORRYING OPTION OF THE JUDICIARY FOR THE MORALITY INSTEAD OF DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW, IT WILL BE STUDIED THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEGISLATIVE NORM, WITH THE ALLEGED POPULAR PARTICIPATION, AND THEN IT WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED THE TRAITS OF A POPULIST POSITION IN THE SUPREME COURT FEDERAL. MOREOVER, TO BETTER ADDRESS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY CONTROL (NOT) EXERCISED BY THE SUPREME COURT, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO BRING HERE ELEMENTS OF THE THEORY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY ON THE RESTRICTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, TO SHOW THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND ARGUMENTATIVE DEVICES USED IN THE ARGUMENTATIVE WORKS THAT CULMINATED IN THE (ABSURD) DECLARATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAW "CLEAN RECORD". AT THE END, IT REFLECTS ON THE LEGACY OF THIS DECISION AND BEFORE THE DEMISE OF THE LAW IN FACE OF A SUBJECTIVE AND PLASTIC MORAL, WHICH BRINGS TO THE GROUNDS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
662	THE CHANNELING OF POPULAR STRUGGLES THROUGH LEGAL CASES IS CENTRAL TO THE STRATEGY OF THE EMERGING ORIGHTS DEFENSEO MOVEMENT IN CHINA, LINKING GRASSROOTS CONTENTION WITH PROFESSIONAL MEDIATORS WHO TRANSLATE GRIEVANCES INTO THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF LAW. THIS WAS THE CASE IN AN UNUSUAL, ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN IN 2005 TO REMOVE AN ELECTED VILLAGE CHIEF IN TAISHI VILLAGE IN GUANGDONG, CHINA, BY LEGAL MEANS. WHILE THE GRIEVANCES THAT SPARKED THE CAMPAIGN WERE ABOUT THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE BENEFITS FROM VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT, THE STRATEGY OF INSTITUTING A RECALL PROCEDURE AND THE FRAMING OF THE CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW OBSCURED DISTINCTLY GENDERED ISSUES OF POVERTY AND INEQUALITY IN THE VILLAGE, EVEN THOUGH WOMEN WERE AMONG THE MOST VISIBLE PROTESTERS. THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS A OSOCIOLOGY OF TRANSLATIONO TO LINK FRAMING PROCESSES AND POWER DYNAMICS, THUS PROPOSING A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO RECONNECTING FRAMING WITH OTHER ASPECTS OF MOVEMENTS. IN THE TAISHI CASE, THE TRANSLATION OF THE DISPUTE INTO THE LANGUAGE OF LAW HAD CONTRARY EFFECTS: IT OPENED THE DOOR TO A LEGITIMATE, IF TEMPORARY, PUBLIC SPACE FOR THE AIRING OF VILLAGERS' CLAIMS. AT THE SAME TIME, TRANSLATION LEGITIMIZED THE VOICES OF OEXPERTSO WHO THEN BECAME DE FACTO LEADERS IN THIS PUBLIC SPACE; IT ALSO INCREASINGLY SHIFTED THE ACTION TO THE INTERNET, TO WHICH THE VILLAGERS APPARENTLY HAD NO ACCESS. THIS ANALYSIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SUCH STRATEGIES MAY RESULT IN EITHER THE FORMATION OF DURABLE RIGHTS-BASED IDENTITIES AMONG GRASSROOTS PARTICIPANTS OR A SENSE OF BEING CONNECTED TO A BROADER SOCIAL MOVEMENT.
663	FETAL HOMICIDE LAWS CRIMINALIZE KILLING A FETUS LARGELY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS KILLING ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING. HISTORICALLY, THE COMMON LAW DID NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZE FETICIDE AS A CRIME, BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE OF THE EVIDENTIARY "BORN-ALIVE" RULE, NOT BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM "HUMAN BEING." AS MEDICINE AND SCIENCE HAVE ADVANCED, STATES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY WILLING TO ABANDON THIS EVIDENTIARY RULE AND TO CRIMINALIZE FETICIDE AS HOMICIDE. ALTHOUGH MOST STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE CRIME OF FETAL HOMICIDE, FOURTEEN HAVE NOT. THIS IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF TWO INDEPENDENT OBSTACLES: (JUDICIAL) ADHERENCE TO THE BORN-ALIVE RULE AND (LEGISLATIVE) CONCERN THAT FETAL HOMICIDE LAWS COULD ERODE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. THIS NOTE EXPLORES A VARIETY OF FETAL HOMICIDE LAWS THAT STATES HAVE ADOPTED, DEMONSTRATING THAT POPULAR OPINION HAS SHIFTED TOWARD RECOGNIZING THIS CRIME. IT THEN DIRECTLY CONFRONTS THE OBJECTIONS THAT HAVE PREVENTED OTHER STATES FROM ADOPTING SUCH LAWS: IT FIRST REVIEWS THE LITERATURE SUGGESTING THAT THE BORN-ALIVE RULE SHOULD BE ABANDONED, AS IT IS AN OBSOLETE EVIDENTIARY STANDARD; IT THEN ARGUES THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED REPRODUCTIVE LIBERTIES CAN BE RECONCILED WITH, AND IN FACT AUGMENTED BY, PUNISHING THE KILLING OF A FETUS AS A HOMICIDE. IT IS REVOLTING TO HAVE NO BETTER REASON FOR A RULE OF LAW THAN THAT SO IT WAS LAID DOWN IN THE TIME OF HENRY IV. IT IS STILL MORE REVOLTING IF THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH IT WAS LAID DOWN HAVE VANISHED LONG SINCE, AND THE RULE SIMPLY PERSISTS FROM BLIND IMITATION OF THE PAST.(1)
664	A KOREAN VERSION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGY WAS ANNOUNCED BY THE YOON SEOK-YEOL ADMINISTRATION IN DECEMBER 2022, TITLED "THE INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGY FOR FREEDOM, PEACE, AND PROSPERITY." SOUTH KOREA, AS A PIVOTAL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, WANTS TO PROJECT VALUES OF LIBERALISM AND SOLIDARITY INTO THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION, PRESENTING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS UNIVERSAL VALUES, AIMING FOR A PROSPEROUS INDO-PACIFIC REGION AND BUILDING TRUST AMONG ITS PEOPLE. IN SOUTH KOREA'S INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGY, THREE MAJOR PRINCIPLES OF RECIPROCITY WERE OUTLINED. THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S "INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGY" AND CONTAINS A STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN SECURITY COOPERATION BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, THE U.S., AND JAPAN, A CORE VALUE ALLIANCE IN NORTHEAST ASIA. IN JANUARY 2023, THE CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES (CSIS), A U.S. DEFENSE THINK TANK, ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS OF A WAR GAME. UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT FOCUSED ON THE ANALYSIS OF ENGAGEMENT AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SMALL TACTICAL UNIT ECHELONS, CSIS CONDUCTED THIS WAR GAME THIS TIME IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THEATER OPERATIONS QUANTITATIVELY BOTH ON A STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL LEVEL AND PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO WAR-RELATED TRENDS AND ASPECTS. THE FOCUS OF MY PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL CHINESE INVASION OF TAIWAN ON THE SECURITY OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA, AND TO EXPLORE THE REASONS WHY AND HOW COOPERATION BETWEEN KOREA, JAPAN, AND THE U.S. COULD ENHANCE SECURITY IN THE REGION. SPECIFICALLY, I WILL USE A WARGAME SIMULATION TO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRIANGULAR SECURITY COOPERATION BETWEEN THESE THREE COUNTRIES.
665	PURPOSETHIS STUDY EXAMINES WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME INEQUALITY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. THE AUTHORS SPECIFICALLY EXAMINE WHETHER THE GREASING OR SANDING EFFECT HOLDS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME INEQUALITY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WHILE MODERATING FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE GREASING EFFECTS SUGGEST THAT INCOME INEQUALITY CAN PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY, WHILE THE SANDING EFFECTS DISINCENTIVISE IT.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE AUTHORS EXAMINE THIS RELATIONSHIP USING A SAMPLE OF 100 ADVANCED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 2006 TO 2018 USING A DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATOR TO CONTROL ENDOGENEITY AND SIMULTANEITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE AUTHORS INCLUDE AN INTERACTION TERM TO ESTIMATE THE MARGINAL EFFECTS OF INCOME INEQUALITY, WHILE MODERATING FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SIX MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.FINDINGSOVERALL, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND INCOME INEQUALITY HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, WHEN MODERATING FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE MARGINAL IMPACT OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS NEGATIVE FOR COUNTRIES WITH LOW LEVELS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE EFFECTIVE MODERATORS IN TERMS OF MAGNITUDE. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE SANDING EFFECT OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS OBSERVED IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, EVEN WHEN MODERATING FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONSTHE MAJOR LIMITATION LIES IN THE ESTIMATION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY, WHICH IS MEASURED USING NEW BUSINESS FORMATION. WHILE THIS IS COMMONLY USED, IT FOCUSES ON FORMAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES AND OVERLOOKS THE INFORMAL ECONOMY.ORIGINALITY/VALUETHIS STUDY PROVIDES NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN MODERATE AND EXPLAIN THE PUZZLING LINK BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY AND INCOME INEQUALITY.
666	THE POLICE OCCUPY A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN NIGERIA. THE NATURE OF POLICE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PUBLIC WERE HANDLED AT THE STATION AND ON THE STREET DAILY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AFFECTS THE WAY THE PEOPLE PERCEIVE THEM AND THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION THEY GET FROM THE PEOPLE IN CURBING CRIME IN THE SOCIETY. THE STUDY TOOK PLACE IN ZARIA, KADUNA STATE, NORTHERN NIGERIA. A STUDY POPULATION WAS THE POLICE IN ZARIA. THREE POLICE STATIONS (ZARIA CITY, SABON GARI, AND SAMARU POLICE STATIONS) WERE PURPOSIVELY SELECTED REFLECTING THE SOCIO-CULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUNDS OF ZARIA RESIDENCE AND POPULATION. THE DIVISIONAL POLICE OFFICERS AND POLICE OFFICERS IN-CHARGE OF CRIME WERE INTERVIEWED. THE POLICE CRIME AND INCIDENCE RECORDS WERE EXAMINED WHILE THE GENERAL CONDUCT AND SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE POLICE AND POLICE STATIONS WERE OBSERVED. USING IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW, OBSERVATIONAL METHOD, AND POLICE RECORDS, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS OF SUSPECTS AFFECTED HOW THEY WERE TREATED BY THE POLICE IN THE POLICE STATIONS STUDIED. ALSO, THE ENVIRONMENT SUSPECT LIVES AFFECTED HOW THEY WERE TREATED TOO BY THE POLICE. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE POLICE MAKE THE RULE OF LAW THEIR GUIDE IN THE HANDLING OF SUSPECTS IN THE POLICE STATIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLE OR AREA OF HABITATION OF THE SUSPECTS. POLICE BRUTALITY AND VIOLATIONS OF CITIZEN'S RIGHTS SHOULD BE CHECKED BY SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS, WHILE COMMUNITY-POLICING STYLE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS COMMUNITIES IN NIGERIA.
667	THIS ARTICLE BELONGS TO A FORTHCOMING SPECIAL CLUSTER, "CONTENTION POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE" GUEST-EDITED BY NEMANJA DZUVEROVIC, JULIA RONE AND TOM JUNES. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE IMPACT OF ONE OF THE RECENT WAVES OF MOBILIZATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, THE "CITIZENS FOR MACEDONIA" PLATFORM, OVER POLICY OUTCOMES THAT ORIGINALLY DERIVED FROM THE MOVEMENT ACTOR. FURTHERMORE, THE TEXT HIGHLIGHTS THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN SHAPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY OUTCOMES, PLAYING THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDERS IN THE PROCESS OF REINTRODUCING OF DEMOCRACY IN THE CAPTURED MACEDONIAN STATE. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND THE LITERATURE REVIEW PRESENT AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE CONTEMPORARY WORKS ON SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES WITH THOSE ON DEMOCRATIZATION AND INTERNATIONAL STATE BUILDING. A LOT OF EMPHASIS IS ALSO PUT ON THE PECULIAR POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE, AND THE DIFFICULT AND MOVEMENT-UNFRIENDLY CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE CITIZENS' PLATFORM OPERATED. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ARTICLE TRIES TO SHOW THE GAINS AND LOSSES OF A COALITION BETWEEN AN ESTABLISHED POLITICAL PARTY, AND A LOOSE HORIZONTAL NETWORK OF CITIZENS AND CITIZENS' ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADVOCATE FOR RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE CENTRAL CONCLUSIONS THAT CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED FROM THIS WORK ARE THE STRONG AND COMMITTED CLAIMS BY THE MOVEMENT, ARTICULATED THROUGH VARIOUS REPERTOIRES OF ACTION, BUT ALSO THE ACTIVE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, WHICH PRESENTED A CONDITIO SINE QUA NON, BRINGING DOWN THE REGIME LED BY FORMER PM NIKOLA GRUEVSKI AND FREEING THE STATE INSTITUTIONS PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN POWER.
668	THE FUNCTIONING OF THE INDEPENDENT CIVIL SECTOR IS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF A WELL-FUNCTIONING DEMOCRATIC STATE. IN ADDITION TO OTHER GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, SUCH AS: THE RULE OF LAW, THE TRIPARTITION OF POWER, INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY FROM OTHER ORGANS AND INSTITUTIONS OF STATE POWER, IT IS THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION REALIZED WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE THIRD SECTOR THAT GIVES CITIZENS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACT IN VARIOUS AREAS OF PUBLIC LIFE, SHAPING SOCIO-POLITICAL REALITY AND TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FATE OF THE LOCAL OR NATIONAL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL ALL THEIR TASKS AND FUNCTIONS, THEY MUST BE GUARANTEED OPTIMAL CONDITIONS TO CONDUCT THEIR ACTIVITIES. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE LEGAL REGULATIONS REGARDING THE CIVIL SECTOR AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL THREATS AND CHALLENGES FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT TO OVER-REGULATE THE SECTOR AND STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE STATE MAY LEAD TO TAKING OVER CONTROL OF THE NONGOVERNMENTAL SECTOR AND ITS CENTRALIZATION, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE ENTIRE SECTOR AND INHIBITING ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE ANALYSIS SHOULD GIVE ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: WHAT CHANGES WERE INTRODUCED AFTER THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN 2015 AND THE TAKEOVER OF POWER BY LAW AND JUSTICE? WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE POLICY TOWARDS THE SECTOR AND HOW DOES IT INFLUENCE ITS FUNCTIONING? WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE NEW INSTITUTION IN SUPPORTING AND DEVELOPING CIVIL SOCIETY? WHAT CHALLENGES AND THREATS IS THE CIVIC SECTOR FACING IN THE CURRENT SOCIO-POLITICAL SITUATION?
669	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE ON THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY OF ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS CONFINED TO ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS OPERATING IN THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) COUNTRIES BANKING SECTORS DURING THE PERIOD OF 2007-2011. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE ANALYSIS COMPRISES TWO MAIN STAGES. IN THE FIRST STAGE, THE AUTHORS EMPLOY THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) METHOD TO COMPUTE THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY OF ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS. THE AUTHORS THEN USED THE MULTIVARIATE PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH THE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS AS AN ESTIMATION METHOD TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL DETERMINANTS AND THE EFFECT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE ON THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY. FINDINGS - THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GREATER VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND RULE OF LAW ENHANCE THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY OF BOTH ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS. THE AUTHORS FIND THAT REGULATORY QUALITY EXERTS POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON ISLAMIC BANKS, WHILE THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ENHANCES THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY OF CONVENTIONAL BANKS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY ON THE SPECIFIC REVENUE EFFICIENCY CONCEPT OF ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKING IS STILL IN ITS FORMATIVE STAGE. IN REGARDS, MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON BANK EFFICIENCY HAVE FOCUSED MORE ON THE CORPORATE OR BANK GOVERNANCE THAT AFFECTS THE GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. THUS, TO THE BEST OF THE KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDY HAS BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THE EFFECT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE ON THE REVENUE EFFICIENCY OF ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS SPECIFICALLY ON THE GCC COUNTRIES.
670	IN MY ANALYSIS OF LEWIS CARROLL'S MICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND (1865) AND THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS 0870, I DEMONSTRATE THAT THE LAW IS ALL-PERVASIVE IN VICTORIAN CULTURE, EVEN IN SUCH UNEXPECTED PLACES AS CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. THE DISTORTIONS IN TIME, SPACE, AND LOGIC IN THE TWO IMAGINARY COUNTRIES THROUGH WHICH ALICE TRAVELS ECHO THE ANACHRONISMS AND SPECIALIZED REASONING OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. IN WONDERLAND, ALICE NEGOTIATES HER WAY THROUGH A RANDOM AND CHAOTIC WORLD, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS REPRESENTED BY THE HARSH ANCIEN REGIME JUSTICE OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. THE BOOK ENDS WITH A TRIAL, WHERE LEGAL PROCEDURE IS TWISTED TO THE ENDS OF ABSOLUTE POWER, BUT ALICE'S INCREASINGLY CONFIDENT LOGIC IS ABLE TO DISRUPT ITS WONDERLAND COUNTERPART COMPLETELY. THE CHESSBOARD WORLD OF THE LOOKING-GLASS COUNTRY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A TOTALLY RULE-BOUND REFLECTION OF BOURGEOIS SOCIETY, WHERE, AS J. S. MILL HAS FAMOUSLY CONTENDED, LAWS AND SOCIAL STRICTURES HAVE COMBINED TOGETHER TO ELIMINATE INDIVIDUALITY. INSTEAD, THERE IS ALL-PERVASIVE ORDER. IN THIS WORLD, ALICE PLAYS BY THE RULES IN THE FORLORN HOPE THAT THE SOCIAL MOBILITY AFFORDED BY THE GAME, WHICH WILL REWARD HER BY MAKING HER A QUEEN IF SHE SUCCEEDS, WILL ALSO HELP HER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAS FOUND HERSELF BUT IN THE PANOPTICAL WORLD OF THE LOOKING-GLASS LEGAL SYSTEM, JUSTICE OPERATES BACKWARD, AND CRIMES ARE PUNISHED BEFORE THEY ARE COMMITTED. SHE CAN GAIN NO VANTAGE OF UNDERSTANDING AND THUS NO ULTIMATE TRIUMPH.
671	ALMOST NINETY PERCENT OF STATE JUDGES TODAY FACE SOME KIND OF POPULAR ELECTION. THIS UNIQUELY AMERICAN INSTITUTION EMERGED IN A SUDDEN BURST FROM 1846 TO 1853, AS TWENTY STATES ADOPTED JUDICIAL ELECTIONS. THE MODERN PERCEPTION IS THAT JUDICIAL ELECTIONS, THEN AND NOW, WEAKEN JUDGES AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN JUDICIAL ELECTIONS SWEPT THE COUNTRY IN THE LATE 1840S AND 1850S, HOWEVER, THE KEY WAS A NEW MOVEMENT TO LIMIT LEGISLATIVE POWER, TO INCREASE JUDICIAL POWER, AND TO STRENGTHEN JUDICIAL REVIEW. OVER TIME, JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS HAD BECOME A TOOL OF PARTY PATRONAGE AND CRONYISM. LEGISLATIVE OVERSPENDING ON INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS AND AN ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IN THE EARLY 18405 TOGETHER HAD PLUNGED THE STATES INTO CRIPPLING DEBT, IN RESPONSE, A WAVE OF NINETEEN STATES CALLED CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS FROM 1844 TO 1853. IN ADDITION TO DIRECT LIMITS ON LEGISLATIVE POWER, MOST OF THESE CONVENTIONS ADOPTED JUDICIAL ELECTIONS. MAIN DELEGATES STATED THAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND EMPOWER COURTS TO USE JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE REFORMERS GOT RESULTS: ELECTED JUDGES IN THE 1850S STRUCK DOWN MANY, MORE STATE LAWS THAN THEIR APPOINTED PREDECESSORS HAD IN ANY OTHER DECADE. THESE ELECTED JUDGES PLAYED A ROLE IN THE SHIFT FROM ACTIVE STATE INVOLVEMENT IN ECONOMIC GROWTH TO LAISSEZ-FAIRE CONSTITUTIONALISM. ODDLY, THE FIRST GENERATION OF ELECTED JUDGES WAS THE FIRST TO JUSTIFY JUDICIAL REVIEW IN COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN TERMS, IN THE DEFENSE OF INDIVIDUAL AND MINORITY RIGHTS AGAINST ABUSIVE MAJORITIES AND THE "EVILS" OF DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH LESSONS ABOUT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY FROM THIS STORY.
672	INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF RIGHTS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY ARE A SET OF NORMS ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS. THESE STANDARDS DEFINE DECENT LIVING CONDITIONS FOR PEOPLE, ENSURE PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY, AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDARDS ESTABLISHED AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IN NATIONAL LEGISLATION IS A TOOL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF RIGHTS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND ANALYZES THE DIRECTION OF THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE SOURCES OF SOCIAL SECURITY LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO STUDY INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL STANDARDS AND THEIR LEGAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY INCLUDES VARIOUS METHODS SUCH AS THE DIALECTICAL METHOD, THE SYSTEMIC METHOD, THE GENETIC METHOD, THE LOGICAL METHOD, THE STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONAL METHOD, THE FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, AND THE COMPARATIVE-LEGAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL-LEGAL METHODS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE, AS THEY MUST BE OBSERVED AS THE MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS IN THE SPHERE OF SOCIAL SECURITY. THE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY A NUMBER OF ILO CONVENTIONS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED, AND NORMS IN CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT CONTRADICT INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THESE STANDARDS AND CREATE SPECIFIC LEGAL MECHANISMS THAT WILL ENABLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND PRINCIPLES.
673	THIS PAPER ANALYZES MORALITIES AND MEANINGS OF JUSTICE (THEVENOT 2006) AMONG THE STUDENTS OF THE SOCIAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY TECHNOLOGICAL COURSE FROM FLUMINENSE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY. THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE COURSE COMBINES EPISTEMOLOGICAL OBSTACLES (BACHELARD 1996) AND MORAL CONTENTS, ANALYZED THROUGH POOR SCORES OBTAINED BY DEBUTANT STUDENTS ON EVALUATIONS AND EXERCISES WHICH DEMAND HISTORICAL AND CRITICAL REFLECTION ABOUT PUBLIC SECURITY IN BRAZIL DURING THE 20TH CENTURY. MEANINGS OF JUSTICE EXPRESSED BY THE STUDENTS WHO DEFEND AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME BECOME EVIDENT DURING THE ADAPTATION TO THE COURSE, WHERE ONE OF THE EVALUATORS' TASKS IS TO EXPLICIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPINION AND KNOWLEDGE, NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A HIGHER EDUCATION DEGREE. AS THE STUDENTS' ANSWERS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COURSE ARE ANALYZED, IT IS IMPLIED THAT MORALITIES IN DISPUTE ARE NOT IDIOSYNCRASIES AND ARE PERCEIVED HERE AS CONFLICTS WHICH FORM MORAL CONTOURS (CARDOSO DE OLIVEIRA 1968) BETWEEN POLICEMEN-STUDENTS AND THE COURSE'S STAFF, REPRESENTATIVE OF A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAZILIAN POLITICAL SCENERY, TO WHICH ARE PERTINENT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE WHO DEFEND AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME AND THOSE WHO HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AS A STARTING POINT OF ANALYSIS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PERCEPTION OF THESE POLICEMEN-STUDENTS IS ANALYZED, IN WHICH THE POLICE CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED APART FROM A HISTORICAL-CRITICAL ANALYSIS, DISTANT FROM THE PERCEPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRAJECTORY OF THEIR AGENTS AND ERASING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST, THIS WAY STATING, AGAINST THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE PRESENTED ON THE COURSE, TO BE DEFENDING UNIVERSAL VALUES.
674	IMPERSONAL COOPERATION AMONG STRANGERS ENABLES SOCIETIES TO CREATE VALUABLE PUBLIC GOODS, SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE, PUBLIC SERVICES, AND DEMOCRACY. SEVERAL FACTORS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN VARIATION IN IMPERSONAL COOPERATION ACROSS SOCIETIES, REFERRING TO INSTITUTIONS (E.G., RULE OF LAW), RELIGION (E.G., BELIEF IN GOD AS A THIRD-PARTY PUNISHER), CULTURAL BELIEFS (E.G., TRUST) AND VALUES (E.G., COLLECTIVISM), AND ECOLOGY (E.G., RELATIONAL MOBILITY). WE TESTED 17 PREREGISTERED HYPOTHESES IN A META-ANALYSIS OF 1,506 STUDIES OF IMPERSONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL DILEMMAS (E.G., THE PUBLIC GOODS GAME) CONDUCTED ACROSS 70 SOCIETIES (K = 2,271), WHERE PEOPLE MAKE COSTLY DECISIONS TO COOPERATE AMONG STRANGERS. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR 10 STUDY CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF STUDIES, WE FOUND VERY LITTLE CROSS-SOCIETAL VARIATION IN IMPERSONAL COOPERATION. CATEGORIZING SOCIETIES INTO CULTURAL GROUPS EXPLAINED NO VARIANCE IN COOPERATION. SIMILARLY, CULTURAL, ANCESTRAL, AND LINGUISTIC DISTANCE BETWEEN SOCIETIES EXPLAINED LITTLE VARIANCE IN COOPERATION. NONE OF THE CROSS-SOCIETAL FACTORS HYPOTHESIZED TO RELATE TO IMPERSONAL COOPERATION EXPLAINED VARIANCE IN COOPERATION ACROSS SOCIETIES. WE REPLICATED THESE CONCLUSIONS WHEN META-ANALYZING 514 STUDIES ACROSS 41 STATES AND NINE REGIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (K = 783). THUS, WE OBSERVED THAT IMPERSONAL COOPERATION OCCURRED IN ALL SOCIETIES-AND TO A SIMILAR DEGREE ACROSS SOCIETIES-SUGGESTING THAT PRIOR RESEARCH MAY HAVE OVEREMPHASIZED THE MAGNITUDE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODERN SOCIETIES IN IMPERSONAL COOPERATION. WE DISCUSS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THEORY, PAST EMPIRICAL RESEARCH AND THE META-ANALYSIS, ADDRESS A LIMITATION OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH ON COOPERATION TO STUDY CULTURE, AND RAISE POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
675	THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM HAS LONG BEEN SEEN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST EUROPEAN ACHIEVEMENTS, WITH ITS EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) AS THE WORLD'S LEADING HUMAN RIGHTS COURT. CURRENT TURBULENT TIMES, HOWEVER, POSE SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM, WHICH IS INCREASINGLY BEING CONTESTED BY THE DEEPENING 'IMPLEMENTATION CRISIS'. THE ABSOLUTE OBLIGATION OF MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE (COE) TO ABIDE BY ECTHR JUDGMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 46 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY COMPROMISED BY THE SELECTIVE APPROACH OF STATES, OFTEN RESULTING IN MINIMAL, DILATORY, LENGTHY OR EVEN CONTESTED COMPLIANCE WITH ECTHR JUDGMENTS. AS THE IMPLEMENTATION BACKLOG HAS GROWN LARGELY AFTER THE ACCESSION TO THE COE OF THE NEWLY EMERGED STATES, AS ASPIRING DEMOCRACIES, IN THE LATE 1990S AND EARLY 2000S FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOUR OF THESE STATES BY LOOKING AT THE SOUTH CAUCASUS STATES: ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN AND GEORGIA. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTIAL COMPLIANCE IS A VERY LIKELY FORM OF COMPLIANCE IN THE SOUTH CAUCASUS STATES AS DEMOCRATISING STATES, AND THAT SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN SUCH BEHAVIOUR DISCUSSED IN THE ARTICLE MAY BE DISTINCTIVE OF STATES THAT JOINED THE COE AS EMERGING DEMOCRACIES AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION. THESE STATES CONTINUE TO DISPLAY VARIOUS VULNERABILITIES IN THE AREAS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. THIS, IN TURN, HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WHOLE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM AND ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT STATES' COMMITMENTS TO THE COE ARE DULY RESPECTED IN THE LONGER TERM.
676	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE USE OF STATE SECRECY BY THE ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES DURING THE POST-9/11 ERA. THE CURRENT TREND CONSISTS OF RELIANCE ON INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION TO TAKE MEASURES THAT CAN SERIOUSLY IMPAIR THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS, REPEATED CLAIMS OF STATE SECRECY BEFORE COURTS, AND, IN GENERAL, AN EVIDENT DRIFT TOWARDS EVER GREATER SECURITY AT THE EXPENSE OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS ATTITUDE CONSISTENT WITH DEMOCRACY, AND ITS RELATED PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND PROPER JUDICIAL REVIEW? AN ADEQUATE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION REQUIRES AN EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS OF WESTERN DEMOCRACIES AIMED AT SCRUTINIZING THE USE OF SECRECY IN ORDER TO AVOID THE CONSIDERABLE AND DISQUIETING RISK OF ABUSES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO THE ABRIDGMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THESE THORNY ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BY ANALYZING THE APPROACH OF DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL (NAMELY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS) COURTS IN SOME PARADIGMATIC CASES OF EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION, SUCH AS THE EL-MASRI AND ABU OMAR CASES. EXTRAORDINARY RENDITIONS ARE A PARAMOUNT EXAMPLE OF A CONTROVERSIAL COUNTER-TERRORISM PRACTICE, MARKED BY A STRONG SHIFT TOWARDS SECRECY AND AT SERIOUS RISK OF RESULTING IN A SUBSTANTIAL DENIAL OF JUSTICE AND PERPETUAL CONCEALMENT OF WRONGDOINGS BY OR ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE CASES ILLUSTRATES THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF EXISTING MECHANISMS AIMED AT OVERSEEING SECRECY AND, THEREFORE, SUGGESTS THAT THE CLAIM OF SECRECY SHOULD BE REVIEWED CAREFULLY BY DOMESTIC COURTS IN ORDER TO FULLY VINDICATE HUMAN RIGHTS AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW.
677	IN THIS ARTICLE WE EXPLORE THE NOTION OF YOUNG CHILDREN AS CITIZENS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE (ECEC). CITIZENSHIP HAS A PLACE IN THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM, IN ENGLAND, AND IS COMPULSORY FOR PUPILS AGED 11-16 YEARS. IN THE EARLY YEARS FOUNDATION STAGE (EYFS) CURRICULUM, FOR CHILDREN AGED FROM 0-5 YEARS, THERE IS NO MENTION OF CITIZENSHIP. THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO VIEWS OF CHILDHOOD AS A TIME OF INNOCENCE TOGETHER WITH A PERCEPTION THAT YOUNG CHILDREN LACK THE ABILITY TO COPE WITH COMPLEX CONCEPTS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING YOUNG CHILDREN'S CAPACITY AND AGENCY TO ENGAGE WITH ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEM AS PRESENT AND FUTURE CITIZENS. WHILST CITIZENSHIP GOES UNMENTIONED, THERE IS A GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENT TO COMMUNICATE 'BRITISH VALUES'. THESE VALUES OF 'DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, MUTUAL RESPECT AND TOLERANCE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS AND BELIEFS' ARE SAID TO BE IMPLICITLY EMBEDDED IN THE EYFS AND INSPECTION PROCEDURES ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE PROVIDERS' COMPLIANCE. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, WE DRAW UPON THEORY AND RESEARCH TO ADVOCATE AND ARGUE FOR DEMOCRATIC ECEC THAT SHOWS THE YOUNGEST CITIZENS RESPECT IN SIX KEY WAYS: I) SEEING AND VALUING THE WHOLE PERSON AND ENCOURAGING APPRECIATION OF DIVERSITY; II) UPHOLDING INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE RIGHTS AND ENABLING PARTICIPATION; III) ENCOURAGING CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING; IV) PROMOTING EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE; V) FOSTERING PEACE AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION; AND VI) CHALLENGING CONSUMERISM AND ENCOURAGING ACTION FOR SUSTAINABILITY. EACH OF THESE IS DISCUSSED TO PROPOSE PEDAGOGIES OF CITIZENSHIP FOR ECEC.
678	THIS PAPER IS A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE CORE CONTENT AND BASIC CONCEPTS OF THE BOOK CHINA'S REFORM: HISTORY, LOGIC AND FUTURE, AND GIVES ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHY CHINA'S REFORM AND OPENING-UP POLICY HAS ACHIEVED GREAT SUCCESS, WHY THE CATCH-UP MODE, EXTENSIVE AND EXTRACTIVE DEVELOPMENT MODE CHINA ADOPTED IN THE PAST THREE DECADES ARE NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE AND WHAT CHINA'S MARKET-ORIENTED REFORMS SHOULD AIM TO ACHIEVE IN THE NEXT STAGE SO THAT READERS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S REFORM. PLANNING AHEAD, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CHINA BADLY NEEDS TO TRANSFORM FROM FACTOR-DRIVEN GROWTH TO EFFICIENCY-DRIVEN AND INNOVATION-DRIVEN GROWTH, THE KEY TO WHICH IS TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE THE LIBERALIZATION OF THOUGHT, PROMOTE REFORM AND OPENING-UP, UNSWERVINGLY FOLLOW THE PATH OF ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION, MARKETIZATION AND PRIVATIZATION, TO ESTABLISH AN INCLUSIVE MODERN MARKET SYSTEM, TO ALLOW THE MARKET TO PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND THE PRIVATE ECONOMY TO PLAY A DOMINANT ROLE IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. THE MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM IS A COMPLICATED PROJECT AND CHINA IS FACED WITH AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF REFORM IN SOME KEY AREAS-THE MAIN BODY OF PRIVATE ECONOMY, THE LIBERALIZATION OF FINANCIAL MARKET AND THE MARKETIZATION OF LAND. MEANWHILE, CHINA NEEDS TO EFFICIENTLY BALANCE THREE ELEMENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, THAT IS, THE RULE OF LAW, EXECUTION AND DEMOCRATIC SUPERVISION, SO AS TO FACILITATE THE MODERNIZATION OF STATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITY.
679	THIS STUDY STARTS FROM THE 2014-2015 EVENTS IN SCOTLAND (REFERENDUM ON INDEPENDENCE)AND IN CATALONIA ("INFORMAL CONSULTATION" AND REGIONAL ELECTIONS). SECESSIONISTS MOVEMENTS IN BOTH CASES WISHED THAT A NEW STATE BORN FROM THE SECESSION WOULD BECOME (ACCORDING TO THEM "CONTINUES TO BE") PART OF THE EU. THAT CONVICTION STRENGTHENS THEM AS THE EU IS SEEN AS A "SAFE HAVEN" ALLOWING INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT THE THREAT OF BEING ISOLATED. THE EU TREATIES NEITHER PROVIDE FOR NOR PROHIBIT THE PARTITION OF A MEMBER STATE. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO BECOME PART OF THE EU THE SECESSIONIST REGION SHOULD FIRST BE RECOGNIZED AS A STATE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND SPECIFICALLY BY THE 28 EU MEMBER STATES (INCLUDING SPAIN AND THE UK). THIS WOULD BE LEGALLY POSSIBLE IF THE NEW STATE WAS BORN IN FULL RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW BUT WOULD EXCLUDE A "STATE" HAVING UNILATERALLY DECLARED ITS INDEPENDENCE IN VIOLATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION. THEN A NEW STATE RECOGNISED COULD BE A CANDIDATE TO THE EU. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT THE PROCEDURE OF ARTICLE 49 OF THE TREATY ON EU WOUD HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED (ACCESSION OF A NEW STATE) AND NOT THAT OF ARTICLE 48 (AMENDMENTS TO THE TREATIES). TAKING SCOTLAND AS AN EXAMPLE THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE NECESSARY LEGAL STEPS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE SECESSION. HE STRESSES THAT THE PARTITION OF AN EU STATE SHOULD NOT ANYMORE BEING REGARDED AS A STRICTLY NATIONAL MATTER. GIVEN ITS CONSEQUENCES ON THE EU AS A WHOLE AND ON OTHER MEMBER STATES IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE EU.
680	THIS ARTICLE IS THE RESULT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH BETWEEN LAW AND ETHICS SCHOLARS FROM UNIVERSITIES IN FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND, WHO HAVE BEEN CLOSELY COLLABORATING WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTS ON THE DESIGN AND USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FIELDS OF HUMAN HEALTH AND SECURITY. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IS A UNIQUE FEATURE AND GUARANTEES IMPORTANT NEW INSIGHTS IN THE SOCIAL, ETHICAL AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ITS AIM IS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE TENSION BETWEEN SECRECY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE DIGITAL ERA. A SPECIAL FOCUS IS PUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF PSYCHOLOGY, MEDICAL ETHICS AND EUROPEAN LAW ON THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS' MOTIVATIONS FOR CONSENTED PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND THEIR FEARS ABOUT UNKNOWN DISCLOSURE, TRANSFERAL AND SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA VIA INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (NAMED THE "PRIVACY PARADOX"). POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND HARMS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY RESULTING FROM THE USE OF COMPUTERS, MOBILE PHONES, THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA ARE BEING DISCUSSED. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS POINT OUT THE ETHICAL AND LEGAL LIMITATIONS INHERENT TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THEY SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY USE ON THE INDIVIDUALS' WELL-BEING, THE LATTER BEING CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION IN EUROPE, IS A PROMISING FEATURE OF THE SOCALLED "E-DEMOCRACY" AS A NEW WAY TO COLLECTIVELY ATTRIBUTE MEANING TO LARGE-SCALE ONLINE ACTIONS, MOTIVATIONS AND IDEAS.
681	IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN PRAISED THE "RESIL-IENCE OF OUR CONSTITUTION " FOR DEFEATING A RIOTOUS MOB THAT ATTEMPTED TO OVERRUN THE CAPITOL AND STOP THE CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES THAT DECLARED HIM THE VICTOR IN THE 2020 ELECTION. BUT CONSTITUTIONALISM ITSELF CAN BE A PATH TO AUTHORITARIANISM, AND OLD CONSTITUTIONS ARE JUST AS RIPE FOR TYRANNICAL EXPLOITATION AS NEW ONES. THIS NOTE IS THE FIRST TO COMPARE U.S. AND VENEZUELAN CONSTI-TUTIONAL DESIGN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS CAN FACILITATE PARTISAN INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE AND ALLOW AUTHORITARI-ANISM TO TAKE ROOT. IN THE UNITED STATES, CONSTITUTIONAL REVERENCE ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS IN 2024, AND DISMISSING THESE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AS THE THING OF "BANANA REPUB-LICS, " AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND SCHOLARS HAVE DONE, WASTES AN OPPORTU-NITY TO IDENTIFY THE PATH THAT PULLED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY TO THE BRINK. INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THE VENEZUELAN CASE AS TOO DISSIMILAR FROM THE AMERICAN ONE, I ARGUE THAT BOTH CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURES ALLOWED AN ELECTED PRESIDENT TO CAPTURE THE LEGISLATURE, PACK THE JUDICIARY, AND DELEGITIMIZE THE CREDIBILITY OF ELECTIONS UNDER THE GUISE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH DISTINCT PATHS. NECESSARY U.S. FED-ERAL REFORMS CAN PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS IN 2024, BUT BECAUSE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND OTHER MINORITARIAN WORK-AROUNDS, STATE REFORMS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN GUARANTEEING ADEQUATE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION. LEGAL SAFEGUARDS TO WARD OFF CONSTITUTIONAL EXPLOI-TATION HAVE TO BE CEMENTED IN PLACE-AS THE ELECTION OF 2020 SHOWED, RELYING ON ABSTRACT NORMS AND SHARED IDEALS IS INSUFFICIENT.
682	THE ISSUE OF GOVERNANCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN SAUDI UNIVERSITIES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT HAS AN EFFECTIVE IMPACT ON ACHIEVING EXCELLENCE IN PERFORMANCE, AND ACHIEVING SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SAUDI SOCIETY. THE APPLICATION OF GOVERNANCE RULES WORKS TO ENHANCE THE VALUES OF JUSTICE, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, COMBATING CORRUPTION, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROVINCE ON PUBLIC FUNDS AND ACHIEVING QUALITY AND EXCELLENCE IN PERFORMANCE. SO, THIS STUDY AIMS TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF THE APPLICATION OF GOVERNANCE RULES AND THE ACCRUAL BASIS ON THE QUALITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTS IN JOUF UNIVERSITY (SAUDI UNIVERSITIES). A TOTAL OF 348 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ISSUED TO RESPONDENTS, WITH 242 BEING RETURNED. TO PUT THE HYPOTHESIZED MODEL TO THE TEST, STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING WAS USED. THE MAJOR FINDINGS CONFIRMED THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE RULES AND ACCRUAL FOUNDATION OF APPLICATION CONTROLS ON THE QUALITY OF JOUF UNIVERSITY'S FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE FINDINGS HAVE NUMEROUS PRACTICAL RAMIFICATIONS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ASSIST MANAGERS IN MAKING SOUND DECISIONS WHEN SELECTING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH GOVERNANCE RULES AND ACCRUAL BASIS OF APPLICATION CONTROLS IN THEIR ORGANIZATION. THIS IS A RARE AND ONE-OF-A-KIND EMPIRICAL STUDY THAT INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE RULES AND ACCRUAL BASIS OF APPLICATION CONTROLS ON THE QUALITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AT SAUDI UNIVERSITIES SUCH AS JOUF UNIVERSITY. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO GIVE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE RULES, THE ACCRUAL BASIS OF APPLICATION CONTROLS, AND FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF UNIVERSITIES.
683	POLITICAL RISK ANALYSIS (PRA) LEVELS ARE THEORETICALLY POSTULATED TO INCREASE IN A HYBRID REGIME. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THERE IS A CHANGE TO THIS HYPOTHESIS. A SINGLE CASE RESEARCH DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED, USING ZIMBABWE FROM 1990 TO 2018. DURING THE PERIOD, ZIMBABWE SHOWED FIVE DIVERSE FORMS OF HYBRIDITY WHICH ARE LIBERAL, COMPETITIVE ILLIBERAL, COMPETITIVE, ILLIBERAL, AND MILITARY HYBRID REGIMES. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED TO ASSESS POLITICAL RISK IN A HYBRID REGIME USING HYBRID REGIME INDICATORS AND SOME POLITICAL RISK FACTORS OF MOST CONCERN TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 28 KEY INFORMANTS FROM SIX CATEGORIES OF RESPONDENTS WERE INTERVIEWED. ILLEGITIMACY, CORRUPTION, THE STALENESS OF LEADERSHIP, ADVERSE GOVERNMENT REGULATION, ELECTION VIOLENCE, AND SEVERED HOME-HOST STATE RELATIONS WERE CONFIRMED TO INCREASE THE PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL RISK IN A HYBRID REGIME. INVESTORS WERE OBSERVED TO HAVE DEVELOPED A TOLERANCE FOR SOME "UNACCEPTABLE" FACTORS THAT INCREASED POLITICAL RISK. MILITARY TUTELAGE, WEAK INSTITUTIONS, FLAWED ELECTIONS, MILITARY GENERALS IN POWER, UNDEMOCRATIC MEANS TO RETAIN POWER, MINIMUM HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND WEAK RULE OF LAW WERE FOUND TO NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE POLITICAL RISK AS BEFORE. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE FORM OF HYBRIDITY AND AS SUCH DIFFERENT FORMS OF HYBRID REGIMES ACCRUE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF POLITICAL RISK, SOME LOWER LEVELS WHILE OTHERS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER LEVELS. THEREFORE, IN A HYBRID REGIME, A DIFFERENTIATED PRA MONITORING, ASSESSING AND MITIGATION STRATEGY WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR MANAGEMENT TO IMPLEMENT. FUTURE STUDIES CAN APPLY THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF ASSESSING PRA IN A HYBRID TO ANOTHER HYBRID REGIME TO EXPAND THE THEORETICAL PROPOSITIONS MADE BY THIS PAPER.
684	LABOUR REGULATION VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT STATES IN INDIA. USING THE STATE-LEVEL LABOUR AMENDMENTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTE ACT (IDA), BESLEY AND BURGESS (Q J ECON 119:91-134, 2004) CLASSIFIED STATES AS PRO-WORKER AND PRO-EMPLOYER STATES. BHATTACHARJEA (INDIAN J LABOR ECON 49(2):211-232, 2006; WORKING PAPER, CENTER ON DEMOCRACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND THE RULE OF LAW FREEMAN SPOGLI INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, STANFORD UNIVERSITY, 2009) CRITICIZED BESLEY AND BURGESS'S (2004) PAPER BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS METHODOLOGY AND IN TERMS OF ITS OVERALL CODING OF THE LABOUR REGULATION INDEX. THE CURRENT PAPER USES THE BESLEY AND BURGESS'S (2004) METHODOLOGY, CLASSIFIES STATES AS FLEXIBLE AND INFLEXIBLE BASED ON THE STATE-LEVEL AMENDMENTS OF THE IDA AND LOOKS INTO THE ISSUE OF MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT FOR THE THREE-DIGIT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES ACROSS INDIAN STATES. DATA ON INDUSTRIAL OUTPUTS AND EMPLOYMENT WERE EXTRACTED FROM ASI THREE-DIGIT MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1980-1981 TO 2006-2007. THE EMPLOYMENT FUNCTION WAS ESTIMATED FOR BOTH TOTAL WORKERS (MEASURED AS 'TOTAL PERSONS ENGAGED') AND PRODUCTION WORKERS (MEASURED AS 'WORKERS') AS DEPENDENT VARIABLES REGRESSED ON THE LABOUR MARKET REGULATION INDEX. THE VARIABLES ARE FOUND TO BE STATIONARY UNDER PANEL UNIT ROOT TESTS. CONTROLLING FOR INDUSTRY-FIXED AND YEAR-FIXED EFFECTS, WE FOUND STRINGENT LABOUR REGULATION TO ADVERSELY AFFECT MANUFACTURING EMPLOYMENT. WE DID NOT FIND ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LABOUR-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES ARE WORST AFFECTED FROM RIGID LABOUR LAWS. THE RESULTS ARE FOUND TO BE ROBUST UNDER DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATION.
685	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PROCEDURAL STATUS AND FORMS OF PROSECUTOR PARTICIPATION IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PUBLIC LAW DISPUTES IN GENERAL JURISDICTION COURTS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC JURISDICTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN. PROBLEMS, CONTRADICTIONS, AND GAPS ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN, WHICH REGULATES THE PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING PUBLIC LAW DISPUTES. MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE NEW APPROACHES OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATOR IN THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN 2008, THE ECONOMIC PROCEDURE CODE 2008; THE CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES OF THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN 2007 WHICH REGULATES THE LEGAL STATUS OF A PROSECUTOR IN RESOLVING PUBLIC LAW DISPUTES IN CIVIL, ECONOMIC, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. IN ALL THESE PROCEDURAL ACTS IN THIS CATEGORY OF DISPUTES, THE PROSECUTOR IS DEFINED AS A PERSON PARTICIPATING IN THE CASE, WHICH IMPLIES HIS LEGAL INTEREST IN THE RULING. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, THE ARTICLE REVEALS THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROSECUTOR IN CASES ARISING FROM PUBLIC LAW RELATIONS ARE TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC INTEREST. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE PROCEDURAL INSTITUTE OF THE PROSECUTOR, AS A PERSON PARTICIPATING IN CASES ON THE RESOLUTION OF PUBLIC LAW DISPUTES, IS NOT NEW. HOWEVER, MANY ISSUES RELATED TO THE PROSECUTOR IN THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN REMAIN UNRESOLVED. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A NECESSITY TO IMPROVE LEGISLATION THAT MANAGES THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PROSECUTOR IN THE CONSIDERATION OF PUBLIC LAW DISPUTES.
686	RESEARCH SUMMARY: CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF MULTINATIONAL STRATEGY, YET WE KNOW RELATIVELY LITTLE HOW CHARITABLE GIVING IS ALLOCATED ACROSS COUNTRIES. USING A SAMPLE OF 208 U.S.-BASED CORPORATE FOUNDATIONS FROM 1993 TO 2008, WE FIND THAT THE FOUNDATIONS GIVE MORE IN COUNTRIES WITH OPAQUE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, BUT THEY DO SO THROUGH INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIARIES. THEY ALSO GIVE MORE WHEN THE FUNDING FIRMS HAVE NEW ENTRIES IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS-HENCE GREATER NEEDS FOR THE SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE-OR WHEN THEIR OPERATIONS REQUIRE STRONGER CONNECTIONS WITH LOCAL SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. THESE FINDINGS POINT TO THE USE OF CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY AS PART OF CORPORATE DIPLOMACY WHEN THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INEFFECTIVE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REACHING OUT TO LOCAL CONSTITUENTS IS HIGH. MANAGERIAL SUMMARY: CORPORATE FOUNDATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FIRMS' CHARITABLE GIVING ACROSS COUNTRIES. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES HOW FOUNDATION GIVING IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUNDING FIRM'S NEED TO NAVIGATE THE LOCAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS. USING A SAMPLE OF 208 U.S.-BASED CORPORATE FOUNDATIONS FROM 1993 TO 2008, WE FIND THAT FOUNDATIONS GIVE MORE IN COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY WEAK RULE OF LAW AND HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION, AND WHEN THE FUNDING FIRMS HAVE NEWLY ESTABLISHED SUBSIDIARIES OR STRONGER NEED TO CONNECT WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS THERE. HOWEVER, DONATIONS TO COUNTRIES WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO THROUGH INTERNATIONAL INTERMEDIARIES TO AVOID POTENTIAL LIABILITIES. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW THAT CORPORATE FOUNDATIONS SUPPORT CORPORATE DIPLOMACY AND HELP OBTAIN THE SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE IN THE HOST COUNTRIES.
687	THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE TUNISIAN BAR IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE REPEATED ATTEMPTS AND DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY PRESIDENT BEN ALI'S AUTHORITARIAN REGIME IN DOMINATING A PROFESSION WHOSE PURPOSE, ACCORDING TO REPRESENTATIVES, IS TO GUARANTEE DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. IN FACT, THE TUNISIAN AUTHORITIES ARE FACED WITH A DILEMMA. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS FROM THE LEGAL PROFESSION BECAUSE IT WOULD INCREASE THE AUTONOMY OF THE BAR AND STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO OPPOSE THE AUTHORITARIAN ORDER. ON THE OTHER HAND, DISMISSAL OF THE LAWYERS' DEMANDS SETS OFF PROFESSIONAL MOVEMENTS WHICH THEN TAKE A POLITICAL TURN LEADING TO A SERIES OF PROTEST-REPRESSION CYCLES IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE BAR AND THE TUNISIAN GOVERNMENT. THE VARIOUS EPISODES OF LAWYERS' MOBILISATION HAVE SHOWN THAT, IN THE TUNISIAN AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXT, A CLAIM OF PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY IS TANTAMOUNT TO A HIGHLY POLITICAL DEMAND IN THE EYES OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE SECTOR-SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE LAWYERS' PROTESTS HAS ENABLED THE BEN ALI REGIME TO OVERCOME THEM RELATIVELY EASILY. ADMITTEDLY, LAWYERS AS A GROUP ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THE VAGARIES OF THE TUNISIAN AUTHORITARIAN MODES OF GOVERNMENT, BUT THE MOBILISATION OF THE NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION IS LIMITED TO ONLY ONE SECTOR AND TO THE CONTROL OF THIS SECTOR. THE GOVERNMENT'S COERCION POLICY HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL INSOFAR AS IT HAS PREVENTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CROSS-MOBILISATION OF MULTIPLE SECTORS OF SOCIAL LIFE, A DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD LIKELY DESTABILISE THE TUNISIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM.
688	THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES HAS TRANSCENDED THE CONFINES OF NATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND BECOME GLOBAL CONCERNS. TO ADDRESS THESE MATTERS, ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION (EE) HAS EMERGED AS A PIVOTAL STRATEGY AIMED AT ELEVATING STUDENTS' AWARENESS, KNOWLEDGE, AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS LIGHT, CHINA HAS INCORPORATED EE INTO ITS OFFICIAL CURRICULUM SINCE 2003. GIVEN THAT CHINA IS A MULTIETHNIC NATION WITH 56 OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED ETHNIC GROUPS, SCHOOLS CATERING TO MINORITIES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO INTEGRATE EE INTO THEIR CURRICULA, AS MANDATED BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS STUDY APPRAISES THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTENT OF THREE TEXTBOOKS: MORALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, KOREAN LANGUAGE, AND CHARACTER AND SOCIETY, PUBLISHED BY YANBIAN EDUCATION PUBLISHING HOUSE IN 2016 FOR CHOSUNJOK (ETHNIC KOREANS), WHICH REPRESENTS THE 13TH LARGEST MINORITY GROUP IN CHINA. TO REVEAL THE UNDERLYING IDEOLOGIES AND CULTURAL VALUES EMBEDDED IN ENVIRONMENTAL TEXTS, THIS STUDY EMPLOYS CRITICAL CURRICULUM THEORIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY (EL) AS ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS. THE FINDINGS ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE CATEGORIES: KNOWLEDGE, AFFECTIVE, AND BEHAVIOUR, WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF EL. THE BEHAVIOUR CATEGORY IS GIVEN THE MOST EMPHASIS, AS IT ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE KNOWLEDGE AND AFFECTIVE CATEGORIES ARE ALSO WELL-REPRESENTED IN THE TEXTS. HOWEVER, THE STUDY OBSERVES A TENDENCY TO AVOID DISCUSSING CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN CHINA AND TO ATTRIBUTE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS TO DOMINANT GROUPS WITHOUT CLEAR EXPLANATIONS. THEREFORE, THE ARTICLE RECOMMENDS THAT CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES BE PROMOTED AMONG STUDENTS AND TEACHERS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND REVEAL CONCEALED IDEOLOGIES IN ENVIRONMENTAL DISCOURSE.
689	IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZE THE EVOLUTION OF THE PROTESTS AFTER THE ELECTION OF THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY IN 2017. WE ADOPT THE IDEA OF A SOCIAL CONFLICT OVER DIVERGING OPINIONS ABOUT HOW THE WORLD SHOULD BE. SHARING SIMILAR OPINION IS ONE BASIS FOR A SENSE OF COLLECTIVE IDENTITY THAT FACILITATES PARTICIPATION IN ACTION TO BRING ABOUT DESIRED CHANGES IN THE WORLD. WE APPROACH SOCIAL CONFLICT AS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPINION-BASED GROUPS, IN WHICH OPINIONS ARE FORMED AND TRANSFORMED LEADING AND SUPPORTING DIFFERENT FORMS OF COLLECTIVE ACTION. WE ANALYZE TWITTER CONVERSATIONS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE SUMMER 2017 ANTI-REGIME PROTESTS IN VENEZUELA. CORRESPONDENCE AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF A CORPUS OF 60,036 TWEETS IS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE THEME AND OPINIONS FROM JULY TO SEPTEMBER 2017. RESULTS SHOW THAT OPINIONS BECOME MORE EXTREME AND ONE-SIDED IN RESPONSE TO OVERT REPRESSION AND THE AUTHORITY'S LACK OF NEGOTIATION WITH MOVEMENTS. AFTER THE REPRESSION OF THE PROTESTS AND PRESIDENT MADURO'S SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, TWEETS SUPPORTING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES DISSIPATED, WHILE MORE RADICAL POSITIONS STRENGTHENED. THESE FINDING SUGGESTS THAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES REST ON A PRECARIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE AUTHORITY. PROTEST MOVEMENTS MAY ARRIVE AT THE PARADOXICAL POSITION IN WHICH RADICALIZATION IS THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD RESPONSE TO REPRESSION: THE MOST RADICAL POSITIONS SURVIVE, WHILE THE MODERATE ONES ARE CO-OPTED OR SUPPRESSED BY THE REGIME. WE ARGUE THAT THIS DYNAMIC MAY HAVE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL CHANGE.
690	THE PRESENT STUDY ANALYZES THE ROUSSEAUNIAN ASSUMPTIONS THAT ADVOCATE DEMOCRACY PARTICIPATED, IN VIEW OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ELIGIBILITY OF NON-LITERATE BRAZILIANS UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE CONCEPT "EXCLUDED FROM WITHIN" PROPOSED BY PIERRE BOURDIEU AND CHAMPAGNE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE. THE EXERCISE OF CITIZENSHIP IS NOT RESTRICTED TO SUFFRAGE. AT THE HEART OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IS THE REPRESENTATIVENESS OF THE PLURALITY OF INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE UP SOCIETY. THE IMPOSITION OF LIMITS ON POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, WHETHER IN ACTIVE OR PASSIVE ELECTORAL CAPACITY, IS A PARADOX OF THE PERMANENT PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. NON-LITERACY PER SE IS MACROSYSTEMIC FAILURE. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF QUANTI-QUALITATIVE, ANALYTICAL-CRITICAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPED FROM THE USE OF MULTIMETHODS TO EXAMINE THE PRAXIS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY LENSES. THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE WEBSITE OF THE SUPERIOR ELECTORAL COURT (TSE) ARE ANALYZED, AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL, LEGAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL CONCEPTS PRESENT IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE AND THE LEGISLATION RELATED TO THE THEME, AIMING TO ANSWER: TO WHAT EXTENT THE PSEUDO-INCLUSION OF NON-LITERATE PEOPLE IN THE BRAZILIAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM MADE THEM "EXCLUDED FROM WITHIN" IN THE FACE OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY? AT THIS JUNCTURE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FACE OF THE INELIGIBILITY OF NON-LITERATE PEOPLE WITH A FULCRUM IN THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF ESSENTIAL DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT TO BREAK THE STIGMATIZATION OF ILLITERATES IN THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS NECESSARY, THEIR INSERTION AND EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE IS NECESSARY.
691	THE PRESENT ARTICLE AIMS TO PRESENT THE COOPERATION INSCRIBED IN ARTICLE 6 OF THE CPC/2015 FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL OF PROCEDURE, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRADICTORY AS A GUARANTEE OF INFLUENCE AND NOT SURPRISE. THE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE USED CONSISTED OF A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS AND PROCEDURAL COOPERATION. THE PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP A STUDY ON PROCEDURAL COOPERATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS MODEL WAS MOTIVATED BY THE VISUALISATION OF WHICH AUTHORS HAVE USED PROCEDURAL COOPERATION TO SUPPORT CONCEPTS THAT REINFORCE JUDICIAL SOLIPSISM AND INCREASE THE POWERS OF THE JUDGE STATE DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE DICTATES OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. FOR THAT, AN ANALYSIS WAS MADE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, UNDERSTOOD AS A PILLAR OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF RIGHT AND MARKED BY THE ARTICULATION BETWEEN CONTRADICTORY AND THE BASIS OF DECISIONS. IT ALSO ANALYSES THE FUNDAMENTAL NORMS OF THE CPC/2015 THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. THIS ANALYSIS OF THE NECESSARY READING OF PROCEDURAL COOPERATION BY THE PRINCIPLE OF ADVERSARIAL LAW MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE PROGRESS IN PROCEDURAL LAW, SINCE IT EMPOWERS A MONOPOLY ON THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW BY JUDGES AND TRIBUNALS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE CREATION OF A SHARED ENVIRONMENT. HAVING ACHIEVED THIS OBJECTIVE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CRITICISE THE ASPECTS OF PROCEDURAL COOPERATION THAT STILL MAINTAINS THE JUDGE AS THE ABOVE PARTY AND CONCLUDE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF ADVERSARY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS ARE THE DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATIONS OF PROCEDURAL COOPERATION IN THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE OF 2015.
692	PROBLEM, RESEARCH STRATEGY, AND FINDINGS: MEGA-EVENTS SUCH AS THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND THE FOOTBALL WORLD CUP HAVE BECOME COMPLEX AND TRANSFORMATIVE UNDERTAKINGS OVER THE LAST 30YEARS, WITH COSTS OFTEN EXCEEDING USD $10 BILLION. THESE EVENTS ARE CURRENTLY PLANNED AND GOVERNED IN WAYS THAT PRODUCE ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR CITIES, REGIONS, AND RESIDENTS. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES A MEGA-EVENT SYNDROME, A GROUP OF SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR TOGETHER AND AFFLICT MEGA-EVENT PLANNING, INCLUDING OVERPROMISING BENEFITS, UNDERESTIMATING COSTS, REWRITING URBAN PLANNING PRIORITIES TO FIT THE EVENT, USING PUBLIC RESOURCES FOR PRIVATE INTEREST, AND SUSPENDING THE REGULAR RULE OF LAW. I DESCRIBE EACH OF THESE SYMPTOMS, PROVIDING EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND MEGA-EVENTS, EXAMINING THE UNDERLYING CAUSES. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON MATERIAL FROM FIELD VISITS TO MEGA-EVENT SITES IN 11 COUNTRIES AS WELL AS 51 INTERVIEWS WITH PLANNERS, MANAGERS, POLITICIANS, AND CONSULTANTS INVOLVED IN MEGA-EVENT PLANNING. TAKEAWAY FOR PRACTICE: TO CURB THE MEGA-EVENT SYNDROME, I PROPOSE BOTH RADICAL AND INCREMENTAL POLICY SUGGESTIONS. THE MOST CRUCIAL RADICAL CHANGE THAT AN EVENT HOST COULD MAKE IS TO NOT TIE MEGA-EVENTS TO LARGE-SCALE URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AVOIDING HIGHER RISKS THAT CREATE COST OVERRUNS, SUBSTANDARD CONSTRUCTION QUALITY, AND OVERSIZED INFRASTRUCTURE NOT SUITABLE FOR POST-EVENT DEMANDS. FURTHER, EVENT HOSTS SHOULD BARGAIN WITH EVENT-GOVERNING BODIES FOR BETTER CONDITIONS, EARMARK AND CAP PUBLIC SECTOR CONTRIBUTIONS, AND SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE ON THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF MEGA-EVENTS. EVENT-GOVERNING BODIES, FOR THEIR PART, SHOULD REDUCE THE SIZE AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE EVENTS.
693	OVER THE PAST DECADE, AND ESPECIALLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, POLITICAL CORRUPTION, FRAUD AND VIOLENCE IN THE PHILIPPINES HAVE REACHED SUCH ALARMING LEVELS THAT MANY FILIPINOS HAVE GROWN DESPONDENT, EVEN CYNICAL, ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY'S POLITICAL SYSTEM. EXPLORING THE SUITABILITY OF THE CONCEPTS OF 'PREDATORY STATE' AND 'PATRIMONIAL OLIGARCHIC STATE' TO THE PHILIPPINES, I FIND THAT THE REGIME RATHER THAN THE STATE IS THE MORE APPROPRIATE UNIT OF ANALYSIS. I ARGUE THAT THE PREDATORY REGIME, CONTROLLED BY A RAPACIOUS ELITE, THAT HELD SWAY DURING THE YEARS OF THE DICTATOR MARCOS, HAS MADE A COMEBACK IN THE PHILIPPINES. UNDER THE GOVERNMENTS OF PRESIDENT JOSEPH ESTRADA AND GLORIA MACAPAGAL ARROYO, TRADITIONAL CLIENTELISM HAS GIVEN WAY TO PERVASIVE CORRUPTION, A SYSTEMATIC PLUNDER OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES AND THE RAPID CORROSION OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS INTO TOOLS FOR PREDATION. INSTEAD OF JUST BEING A THROWBACK TO THE 'OLD CORRUPTION' OF THE MARCOS ERA, HOWEVER, THE CURRENT PREDATORY REGIME REPRESENTS A 'NEW CORRUPTION' ADAPTED TO THE WAYS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION. WHILE NOT AS AUTHORITARIAN AS MARCOS' REGIME, IT HAS GROWING AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES: CENTRALIZATION OF POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE; HEIGHTENED REPRESSION; RIGGED ELECTIONS; A MUCH WEAKENED RULE OF LAW; NUMEROUS POLITICAL APPOINTEES IN THE BUREAUCRACY; AND INCREASED INFLUENCE OF THE MILITARY. A SHIFT TO NAKED AUTHORITARIANISM, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE RULED OUT. AS FORCES FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM ARE MUCH TOO WEAK, THE PREDATORY REGIME MAY BE AROUND FOR SOME TIME OR IT COULD GIVE WAY, AT BEST, TO A MORE TRADITIONAL CLIENTELIST ELECTORAL REGIME. PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN THE PHILIPPINES IN THE NEAR FUTURE APPEAR BLEAK.
694	ALTHOUGH IT IS AN ISSUE OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST TO REPORTERS AND PRESS ORGANIZATIONS, ANTIPRESS VIOLENCE HAS NOT ELICITED A GREAT DEAL OF SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. WHILE IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPED DEMOCRACIES, STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT VIOLENCE AGAINST THE PRESS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE SITUATION IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT ELSEWHERE. THIS GAP IS NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THAT THE LITERATURE ON PRESS AND DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN LARGELY PRODUCED IN THE WEST AND HAS LARGELY REFLECTED THE ABSENCE OF ANTIPRESS VIOLENCE IN WESTERN NATIONS. THE PERSISTENCE OF ATTACKS AGAINST JOURNALISTS OUTSIDE THE WEST, HOWEVER, MAKES IT NECESSARY TO PUT IT AT THE CENTER TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION OF JOURNALISTIC LABOR AND THE PROSPECTS FOR THE PRESS IN HISTORICALLY WEAK DEMOCRACIES. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES ANTIPRESS VIOLENCE BY FOCUSING ON THE LATIN AMERICAN CASE. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IN POSTAUTHORITARIAN SITUATIONS,THE BREAKDOWN OF THE STATE ACCOUNTS FOR WHY THE PRESS, PARTICULARLY INVESTIGATIVE REPORTERS AND PUBLICATIONS, IS THE TARGET OF VIOLENCE. ANTIPRESS VIOLENCE REFLECTS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE STATE'S FULFILLING ITS MISSION TO MONOPOLIZE THE LEGITIMATE USE OF VIOLENCE AND THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACKS. BECAUSE IT IS A CENTRAL ARENA IN THE BATTLE FOR PUBLIC EXPRESSION, THE PRESS BECOMES A PROMINENT TARGET WHEN NAKED VIOLENCE REPLACES THE RULE OF LAW. THE FATE OF THE PRESS IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED TO THE FATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE. THERE CANNOT BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESS AS LONG AS THE STATE DOES NOT SECURE MINIMAL INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS THAT DEMOCRACY DEMANDS.
695	ADDRESSING RISKS AND PANDEMICS AT A COUNTRY LEVEL IS A COMPLEX TASK THAT REQUIRES TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES. THE PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY GROUPS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY A SIMILAR COVID-19 RESILIENCE INDEX (CRI). DEVELOPED IN THE PAPER CRI INDEX REFLECTS THE COUNTRIES' COVID-19 RISK AND THEIR READINESS FOR A CRISIS SITUATION, INCLUDING A PANDEMIC. MOREOVER, THE STUDY DETECTS THE FACTORS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATE THE DISTINGUISHED GROUPS. ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH, BULGARIA, HUNGARY, MALTA, AND POLAND HAVE THE LOWEST COVID-19 RESILIENCE INDEX SCORE, WITH CROATIA, GREECE, CZECHIA, AND SLOVAKIA FOLLOWING CLOSE. AT THE SAME TIME, IRELAND AND SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES OCCUPY THE TOP OF THE LEADER BOARD, FOLLOWED BY LUXEMBURG. THE KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST RESULTS INDICATE FOUR COVID-19 RISK INDICATORS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATE THE COUNTRIES IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AMONG THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS ARE NOT ONLY COVID-19-RELATED FACTORS, I.E., THE CHANGES IN RESIDENTIAL HUMAN MOBILITY, THE STRINGENCY OF ANTI-COVID-19 POLICY, BUT ALSO STRICTLY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, NAMELY POLLUTION AND MATERIAL FOOTPRINT. IT INDICATES THAT THE MOST CRITICAL GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES MIGHT BE CRUCIAL IN THE PHASE OF A FUTURE PANDEMIC. MOREOVER, WE DETECT EIGHT READINESS FACTORS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENTIATE THE ANALYSED COUNTRY GROUPS. AMONG THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS ARE THE ECONOMIC INDICATORS SUCH AS GDP PER CAPITA AND LABOUR MARKETS, THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS RULE OF LAW, ACCESS TO INFORMATION, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADAPTABILITY MEASURES, AND SOCIAL INDICATORS SUCH AS TERTIARY ATTAINMENT AND RESEARCH, INNOVATION, AND INFRASTRUCTURE.
696	PURPOSE- THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS AND DECOMPOSE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT USING THE 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) IN IRAN IN 2018, FOR PROPOSING AGENDA-SETTING OF PUBLIC POLICY.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - IT RANKS THE SDGS NOT ONLY IN IRAN BUT ALSO IN THE REGION AND THE WORLD TO REVEAL THE SYNERGETIC EFFECTS.FINDINGS - BASED ON THE RESULTS, SUBALTERN-POPULACE GENERALLY SUFFERS FROM THE HEGEMONIC DOMINATION OF RULING ELITE-BOURGEOIS, LACK OF STRONG INSTITUTIONS, HETEROGENEOUS POLICY NETWORKS AND LACK OF ADVOCACY ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, DUE TO NO TRANSPARENCY, ISSUES IN LAW OR NO RULE OF LAW, NO STRINGENT REGULATION, RENT, SUPPRESSION AND MAFIA, ALL LEADING TO CORRUPTION AND INJUSTICE.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - TO STOP THE LOOP OF CORRUPTION-INJUSTICE, IRAN SHOULD HOMOGENIZE THE STRUCTURE OF THE POLICY NETWORK. FURTHERMORE, THE FAILED SDGS OF THE THREE-GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS ARE THE SAME IN A CHARACTER; ALL OF THEM PROPOSE SDG 3, GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AS A SERIOUS FAILED GOAL.SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - IN THIS REGARD, STRONG EVIDENCE IS THE PANDEMIC CORONAVIRUS, COVID 19 SINCE 2019, DUE TO ITS HIGHLY-DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES IN EARLY 2020 WHERE THE PUBLIC POLICYMAKERS COULD NOT ADOPT POLICIES PROMPTLY IN THE GLOB, PARTICULARLY IN IRAN.ORIGINALITY/VALUE - IN IRAN, IN ADDITION TO THIS, THE MALFUNCTION OF HEALTH IS ROOTED IN "SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING" AND "TRAFFIC DEATHS," RESPECTIVELY. CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATIONS SYSTEM IN IRAN, IT IS UNDERSCORED THAT IT IS DAMAGING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT FROM ALL THE THREE PILLARS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL.
697	THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES TO LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP A NEW HORIZON FOR PRO-IMMIGRANT SCHOLARSHIP AND ADVOCACY: DEPORTATION ABOLITION. THE EVER-PRESENT THREAT OF DEPORTATION SHAPES THE DAILY LIVES OF NONCITIZENS. INSTEAD OF AIMING FOR A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP, MOST NONCITIZENS MUST NOW CONTEND WITH DODGING THE MANY PATHWAYS TO BANISHMENT. DESPITE GROWING THREATS TO IMMIGRANT SURVIVAL, MOST PRO-IMMIGRANT SCHOLARSHIP AND ADVOCACY THAT AIMS TO REDUCE MIGRANT SUFFERING ASSUMES DEPORTATION AS INEVITABLE. THE FOCUS REMAINS ON IMPROVING INDIVIDUAL OUTCOMES BY ALIGNING THE PROCESS OF DEPORTATION WITH DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW. BUT CONSIDERED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THOSE FACING DEPORTATION, EVEN A FAIRLY ADJUDICATED DEPORTATION CAN PROVE DEVASTATING. MOREOVER, NONE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPORTATION MANAGEMENT CAN ELIMINATE THE RACIALIZED VIOLENCE THAT DEFINES THE PRACTICE. WHILE POST-ENTRY SOCIAL CONTROL AND EXTENDED BORDER CONTROL PURPORTEDLY JUSTIFY DEPORTATION, THE STATED GOALS OF DEPORTATION LAW OBFUSCATE ITS TRUE CHARACTER AS AN INDEFENSIBLE ACT OF VIOLENCE. THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT DEPORTATION CAN AND SHOULD CONTINUE INDEFINITELY CURRENTLY DEMARCATES THE OUTER LIMITS OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR ADDRESSING DEPORTATION-LIMITS THAT A COMMITMENT TO DEPORTATION ABOLITION WOULD ABANDON. IN AN EFFORT TO DENATURALIZE THE COMMON SENSE OF DEPORTATION, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE FUNDAMENTAL FAILURES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE PRACTICE. BY QUESTIONING COMMONLY HELD ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ITS INEVITABILITY, CRITIQUING REFORM PROPOSALS THAT REIFY ITS LOGIC, AND PROVIDING EXAMPLES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT POINT TOWARD THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS DEMISE, THIS ARTICLE OPENS THE DOOR TO THE END OF DEPORTATION. DECARCERAL DEMANDS MADE BY SOCIAL MOVEMENTS.
698	AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROVIDES THE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SOUND ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. CONVENTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, DERIVING FROM THE COMBINATION OF THE VERTICAL MANAGEMENT OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AND THE LOCALIZED MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, CAN LEAD TO LOCAL PROTECTIONISM AND IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SINCE 2016, ENVIRONMENTAL VERTICAL MANAGEMENT REFORM HAS BEEN PERFORMED AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE OVERALL PROMOTION OF THE ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION IN CHINA. REPRESENTING THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL REFORM OF CHINA'S LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SINCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW OF 1989, THE ENVIRONMENTAL VERTICAL MANAGEMENT REFORM FOCUSES ON THE RECONSTRUCTION AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS AMONG THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITIES AT THE PROVINCIAL, CITY, AND COUNTY LEVELS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE BASIC THEORY OF THE VERTICAL MANAGEMENT MODEL, AS WELL AS THE MOTIVATION FOR-AND THE LEGAL/POLICY BACKGROUND, FOCUSES/CONTENT, LOCAL PRACTICES, AND RESULTS OF-THE ENVIRONMENTAL VERTICAL MANAGEMENT REFORM IN CHINA. IN THE DISCUSSION SECTION, WE ANALYZE THE CURRENT PROBLEMS THAT IMPEDE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS REFORM. ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT AND THE PROBLEMS, WE RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS ROUND OF REFORM IS EFFECTIVE AND WILL BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES, FEASIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED. THESE SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE FIRMLY PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE REFORM, ENHANCING THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPLY AND CAPACITY BUILDING AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL, AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE HOLISTIC GOVERNANCE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC).
699	WHAT IS LEFT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY IN THE CONTEXT OF EU ASYLUM LAW? THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE SOLIDARITY CRISIS THE EU HAS EXPERIENCED WITH THE FAILURE OF RELOCATION SCHEMES. RELOCATION SCHEMES HAVE TRIED TO ALLEVIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SO-CALLED MIGRATION CRISIS OF 2015-2016, BUT DID NOT PROVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE OF THE LOW RELOCATION RATES, IN ADDITION TO OPEN CONTESTATION BY STATES OF THE VISEGRAD GROUP. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE STALEMATE OF THE REFORM OF THE DUBLIN REGULATION, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES 'MEASURES' ADOPTED AFTER THE FAILURE OF RELOCATION SCHEMES, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS TO COUNTER SECONDARY MOVEMENTS AND 'AD HOC' TEMPORARY DISEMBARKATION SCHEMES. BOTH MEASURES ARE AIMING AT FIXING LONGSTANDING QUESTIONS (E.G., LIMITING SECONDARY MOVEMENTS, PROVIDING SAFE DISEMBARKATION FOR IRREGULAR MIGRANTS): IN THE FIRST CASE, STATES PROCEED AT BILATERAL LEVEL WITH ARRANGEMENTS CREATING FAST-TRACK RETURNS AND STOPPING SECONDARY MOVEMENTS; IN THE SECOND CASE, THE EU IS TRYING TO SUPPORT STATES' ARRANGEMENTS FOR DISEMBARKATION OF MIGRANTS AFTER SAR OPERATIONS. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT, WHILE REFORMS OF LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT PROGRESSING, MEMBER STATES AND, TO SOME EXTENT, ALSO EU INSTITUTIONS ARE GOING DOWN THE LANE OF 'OPERATIONAL AND INFORMAL ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE 'BRICOLAGE SOLUTIONS' TO COUNTERBALANCE UNDESIRED EFFECTS OF THE STATUS QUO, WHILE WAITING FOR STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY BUT NOT IN SIGHT. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE DANGERS OF SUCH A TREND TOWARD INFORMAL OPERATIONAL SOLUTIONS, AS A CHALLENGE TO THE EU AS A SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
700	HISTORICALLY, NIGERIA AS A SOCIO-POLITICAL FORMATION HAS EXPERIENCED AND STILL EXPERIENCING ABOUT 21 YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED DEMOCRATIC RULE SINCE THE CIVILIAN TAKEOVER OF LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX FROM THE MILITARY IN MAY 1999. ALL OVER THE WORLD, CIVILIAN OR DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION/SPEECH, RULE OF LAW, QUALITY LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE, HEALTH CARE FACILITIES, QUALITY EDUCATION AND OTHER SOCIAL AMENITIES. THIS PAPER WHICH SHALL USE ANALYTIC, EXPOSITORY AND RATIONAL METHODS ARGUED THAT POOR LEADERSHIP, IN APPROPRIATE POLICIES AND PURSUIT OF PERSONAL DRIVES HAVE DENIED THE MASSES THE BENEFIT OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER ARGUES FURTHER THAT ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP CREDENTIALS AND RATIONALITY HAVE FURTHER PLACED NIGERIA ON A CROSS ROAD THEREBY MAKING IT UNABLE TO TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS IN COMBATING THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. LEADERSHIP INEPTITUDENESS, POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL RASCALITY, CORRUPTION AND HIGH-LEVEL ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS PROFLIGACY HAVE DENIED THE PEOPLE ADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH SECTOR, WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR NIGERIA TO RESPOND POSITIVELY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES, THAT CONSISTENT AND PRAGMATIC ELIMINATION/EROSION OF ETHNO-RELIGIOUS, LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL BOUNDARIES FROM OUR CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BIRTH INTO POSITIVE MENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE LEADERSHIP CLASS THAT WILL NAVIGATE INTO A PROCESS OF POSITIVE DIRECTION THAT WILL MAKE NIGERIA TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TOWARDS FINDING SOLUTION TO PROBLEMS RATHER THAN DEPENDING ON THE WEST, DEVELOPMENT OF HOME GROWN MEDICINE REMAINS A COMBATIVE THERAPY IN A HOPELESS SITUATION SUCH AS THIS 2020 GLOBAL LIVING.
701	GREEK PHILOSOPHERS HAD ACCEPTED "RULE OF LAW" AS DESIRED GOVERNANCE SYSTEM SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO PROVIDE ALL CITIZENS' PUBLIC INTEREST. IN TODAY'S SOCIETIES WHERE PUBLIC POLICY IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE INTERESTS OF TOTAL SOCIETY OR AT LEAST ITS MAJORITY, IT IS TOO VITAL TO RECOGNIZE THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC INTEREST. LIKE OTHER CONCEPTS, IT IS ALSO RADICALLY TRANSFORMED IN MODERN AGE, DESPITE VARIED PERCEPTIONS ON THIS CONCEPT, MODERN CONCEPT OF PUBLIC INTEREST IS UNDERSTOOD AS RECOGNIZING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, ACCEPTING UTILITY PRINCIPLE WHICH MEANS TO ATTRACT THE HIGHEST INTEREST FOR MOST PEOPLE, RESPECTING LEGAL PROCESS AND ADAPTING WITH COMMON VALUES OF SOCIETY INDEPENDENT OF INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IS SHAPED IN THREE MAIN AREAS INCLUDING CRIMINAL PROCESS, ENTITIES AND ITS GOVERNING LAWS AFFECTED BY PUBLIC INTEREST CONCEPT. REGULATIONS SUCH AS COMPETENCIES AND PENAL PROVISIONAL REMEDY, ENTITIES LIKE THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AND NGOS AND CRIMINAL PROCESS MODELS LIKE CRIME CONTROL ARE ALL JUSTIFIED BY THIS CONCEPT. IN PRESENT PAPER, IT IS ATTEMPTED TO ADAPT SUCH CLAIM TO IRANIAN PROCEDURAL RIGHTS BY SOME ILLUMINATIONS. ONE CAN CLAIM THAT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IS ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS ARENAS OF PUBLIC INTEREST WHERE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS CLASH. SINCE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IS SET TO PROVIDE PUBLIC INTEREST LIKE MANY OTHER LAWS, IT ALSO SUPPORTS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. SUCH RIGHTS INCLUDE BOTH PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS. ON THIS BASIS, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AIMS AT ACHIEVING A BALANCE POINT BETWEEN PUBLIC INTEREST AND INDIVIDUAL INTEREST. HERE, WE STUDY THE CHALLENGE OF FOUR RIGHTS SUPPORTED BY CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ON PUBLIC INTEREST IN IRANIAN LAWS.
702	THIS INQUIRY INVESTIGATES THE CONCEPT OF EUROPEAN VALUES AND CULTURAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, LEGAL AND POLITICAL PRESUPPOSITIONS ON WHICH THE IDEA OF EUROPEAN VALUES IS BASED. THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES TO THE IDEA OF EUROPEAN VALUES. THE FIRST ONE IS SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH (AND INCLUDES PHILOSOPHICAL, ETHICAL, RELIGIOUS AND IDEOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF VALUES). THE SUBSTANTIVE APPROACH DEFINES EUROPEAN VALUES AS BASED ON THE EUROPEAN HERITAGE (ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME, CHRISTIANITY, RENAISSANCE AND HUMANISM, ENLIGHTENMENT AND LIBERAL TRADITIONS). THIS CONCEPTION OF EUROPEAN VALUES IS FIXED. ANOTHER UNDERSTANDING OF EUROPEAN VALUES IS REPRESENTED BY LEGAL/POLITICAL APPROACH (THAT INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF EUROPEAN VALUES WITHIN EUROPEAN TREATISES, DECLARATIONS, CHARTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS). LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEFINITION OF EUROPEAN VALUES INCLUDES: HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. MOST AUTHORS CONSIDER THAT ONLY FROM THIS SECOND LEVEL, FROM LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEFINITION, GENERAL FEATURES OF EUROPEAN VALUES CAN BE ACHIEVED, THAT IS, UNIVERSAL RULES OF THE GAME. THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW THESE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES CAN BE INTEGRATED, RELYING ON JOHN RAWLS'S IDEA OF OVERLAPPING CONSENSUS. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE QUESTION OF EUROPEAN VALUES AND EUROPEAN IDENTITY IS STILL A TOPIC OF DEBATE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE CONCEPTS, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL DEFINITIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EUROPEAN DECLARATIONS AND TREATIES. EUROPEAN IDENTITY (BASED ON EUROPEAN VALUES) IS A POLYPHONIC CATEGORY, WHICH CANNOT BE FOUNDED ON MONOLITHIC DEFINITIONS. OTHERWISE, THE ENTIRE CONTINENT WOULD FALL UNDER THE RULE OF ONE HOMOGENEOUS CULTURE.
703	EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT (CETA) AMONG CANADA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND OF THE ONGOING EU-US NEGOTIATIONS ON A TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (TTIP) DEPEND ON THEIR LEGAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL METHODOLOGIES FOR MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF PUBLIC GOODS (PGS) LIKE A TRANSATLANTIC MARKET. IN CONTRAST TO THE AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN POST-WAR LEADERSHIP FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE OF PGS (AS RECALLED IN SECTION I), THE CETA FAILS TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES IN TRANSATLANTIC MARKET REGULATION (SECTION II). TTIP NEGOTIATORS LIKEWISE PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC AND UTILITARIAN GROUP INTERESTS IN ORDER TO LIMIT OPPOSITION TO A SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF TTIP; THIS RISKS UNDERMINING 'REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE' AND RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AS LIMITATIONS ON THE LONGSTANDING GOVERNANCE FAILURES IN THE TRANSATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP SINCE THE 1990S (SECTION III). RATHER THAN COMPLYING WITH THE EU TREATY REQUIREMENTS TO BASE EXTERNAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (FTAS) ON THE 'CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES' THAT SUCCESSFULLY GOVERN MARKET REGULATION AND COMPETITION THROUGHOUT EUROPE, TRADE NEGOTIATORS ABUSE THEIR 'EXECUTIVE MONOPOLY' OVER TRANSATLANTIC NEGOTIATIONS SO AS TO LIMIT THEIR OWN LEGAL, DEMOCRATIC, AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY VIS-A -VIS CITIZENS. CIVIL SOCIETY AND PARLIAMENTS SHOULD RESIST SUCH 'DISCONNECTED WESTPHALIAN GOVERNANCE' AND INSIST THAT INTERNATIONAL TREATIES WITH 'LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS' FOR PROTECTING TRANSNATIONAL PGS MUST BE GOVERNED DEMOCRATICALLY AND PROTECT TRANSNATIONAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF CITIZENS SO AS TO ENABLE THE 'DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS' TO HOLD GOVERNANCE AGENTS AND THEIR LIMITED 'CONSTITUTED POWERS' MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE UBIQUITY OF 'MARKET FAILURES' AND 'GOVERNANCE FAILURES' THAT CONTINUE TO DISTORT TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS, RULE OF LAW, AND CONSUMER WELFARE.
704	OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE IN AFRICA, NO EVENT HAS CAPTURED THE MINDS AND IMAGINATIONS OF ACTIVISTS, SCHOLARS AND POLICY MAKERS AND HAS CHALLENGED THE CONSCIENCE OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY LIKE POLITICAL VIOLENCE. SOUTH SUDAN HAS JUST COMPLETED A REFERENDUM ON SELF-DETERMINATION. THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN WAS INAUGURATED ON 9 JULY 2011. THE CHALLENGE THAT LIES AHEAD FOR THE NEW REPUBLIC IS THAT FACED BY ALL AFRICAN STATES: IT MUST REFORM THE COLONIAL STATE INHERITED AT INDEPENDENCE, BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE POLITICAL COMMUNITY THAT EFFECTIVELY MANAGES DIVERSITY, UPHOLDS THE RULE OF LAW AND PRACTISES DEMOCRACY IN GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW SUDAN FRAMEWORK, AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO THE INTRACTABLE CONFLICT IN SUDAN AND A MODEL FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN AFRICA. IN THE FIRST SECTION THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT RISE IN ETHNIC VIOLENCE ACROSS SOUTH SUDAN AND THE BORDER REGIONS IS DUE TO THE FAILURE TO REFORM THE COLONIAL STATE INHERITED FROM GREAT BRITAIN IN THE LATE 20TH CENTURY. VIOLENCE IN THE DISPUTED REGIONS IS ANALYSED TO ILLUSTRATE THE DILEMMA THAT FACES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH SUDAN IN A POST-REFERENDUM ERA. LASTLY, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE WAY OUT OF THE CURRENT PREDICAMENT IN THE DISPUTED REGIONS AND THE WAY TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE POLITICAL COMMUNITY IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH THAT RESPECTS UNITY IN DIVERSITY IS CONTAINED IN THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK KNOWN AS THE NEW SUDAN, WHICH WAS ARTICULATED BY THE SUDAN PEOPLE'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT/ARMY (SPLM/A).
705	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG LEGAL AID PLAINTIFFS IN SHANGHAI. IT IS BASED ON 16 MONTHS OF RESEARCH AT A LARGE LEGAL AID CENTER AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH 50 PLAINTIFFS. CHINESE LEGAL AID PLAINTIFFS COME TO THE LEGAL PROCESS WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THEIR RIGHTS; HOWEVER, THEY ALSO HAVE ONLY A VAGUE AND IMPRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF LEGAL PROCEDURE AND THEIR ACTUAL CODIFIED RIGHTS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF LEGAL MOBILIZATION, PLAINTIFFS' LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGES IN TWO SEPARATE DIMENSIONS: CHANGES IN ONE'S FEELINGS OF EFFICACY AND COMPETENCY VIS-A-VIS THE LAW, AND CHANGES IN ONE'S PERCEPTION/EVALUATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. PUT ANOTHER WAY, THE FIRST DIMENSION IS "HOW WELL CAN I WORK THE LAW?" AND THE SECOND IS "HOW WELL DOES THE LAW WORK?" IN THIS STUDY I OBSERVE POSITIVE CHANGES IN FEELINGS OF INDIVIDUAL EFFICACY AND COMPETENCY THAT ARE COMBINED WITH MORE NEGATIVE EVALUATIONS/PERCEPTIONS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF ITS FAIRNESS AND EFFECTIVENESS. THE POSITIVE FEELINGS OF EFFICACY AND VOICE PROVIDED BY THE LEGAL PROCESS ENCOURAGE LABOR DISPUTE PLAINTIFFS IN THE POST-DISPUTE PERIOD TO PLAN NEW LAWSUITS AND TO HELP FRIENDS AND RELATIVES WITH THEIR LEGAL PROBLEMS. DISENCHANTMENT WITH THE PROMISES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM DOES NOT LEAD TO DESPONDENCY, BUT TO MORE CRITICAL, INFORMED ACTION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES NEW EVIDENCE ON THE NATURE OF CHINA'S DEVELOPING LEGAL SYSTEM WITH A FOCUS ON THE SOCIAL RESPONSE TO THE STATE-LED "RULE OF LAW" PROJECT.
706	IN THE 1949 CASE OF WILLIAMS V. NEW YORK, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT APPROVED OF JUDICIAL FACTFINDING AS A FEATURE OF DISCRETIONARY SENTENCING. THE COURT'S MORE RECENT BAN ON JUDICIAL FACTFINDING IN DETERMINATE SENTENCING SYSTEMS WOULD SEEM TO APPLY TO DISCRETIONARY SENTENCING SYSTEMS AS WELL, IMPLYING THAT WILLIAMS IS NO LONGER GOOD LAW. IF A SENTENCING JUDGE MAY FIND FACTS IN THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETIONARY SENTENCING AS A MATTER OF DUE PROCESS, THEN A LEGISLATURE'S ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES INTO SENTENCING BY CREATING A DETERMINATE SENTENCING REGIME HARDLY SEEMS TO CALL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON JUDICIAL FACTFINDING. AND YET, THE COURT HAS NOT ONLY LEFT WILLIAMS INTACT, BUT EMBRACED IT IN BOOKER V. UNITED STATES AS A REMEDY FOR THE FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES' INCONSISTENCY WITH BLAKELY. THIS ESSAY OFFERS A RATIONALE FOR THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF WILLIAMS AND THE CONTINUED PRACTICE OF UNCONSTRAINED JUDICIAL FACTFINDING IN DISCRETIONARY SENTENCING SYSTEMS. PROFESSOR HUIGENS DESCRIBES AND COMPARES THE NORMATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF OFFENSE DEFINITION AND ADJUDICATION TO THAT OF SENTENCING IN TERMS OF TWO FUNDAMENTAL AND COMPETING VALUES IN CRIMINAL LAW: LEGALITY AND FINE-GRAINEDNESS. HE ARGUES THAT IF A LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO IMPOSE THE NORMATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF OFFENSE DEFINITION AND ADJUDICATION ONTO SENTENCING, THEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION APPROPRIATE TO OFFENSE DEFINITION AND ADJUDICATION IS MADE RELEVANT TO SENTENCING. THIS IS A NORMATIVE ARGUMENT, BUT ONE THAT IS COMPELLING IN LIGHT OF AN INCREASED CONCEPTUAL CLARITY ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND NORMATIVE ARCHITECTURE OF CRIMINAL LAW.
707	WHEN AND WHY ARE CODIFIED CONSTITUTIONS EFFICACIOUS? ANSWERING THESE KEY AND APPARENTLY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS TURNS OUT TO BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. THE ROAD TO RESPONDING TO THEM IS PAVED WITH CONCEPTUAL, THEORETICAL, AND EMPIRICAL DIFFICULTIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, I MAKE A MODEST, BUT NEVERTHELESS HOPEFULLY USEFUL, CLAIM: THAT OVERLOOKING CERTAIN CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL AGENDA ON CONSTITUTIONAL EFFICACY. IN OTHER WORDS, I POSIT THAT EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH LINKED TO THESE QUESTIONS CAN BENEFIT FROM A CLEAR CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL (OR MORE BROADLY FORMAL) EFFICACY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA TO OVERLOOK THE QUESTION "HOW SHOULD CONSTITUTIONAL EFFICACY BE CONCEPTUALIZED?" A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF ACADEMIC SOURCES MAKES IT CLEAR THAT EVEN SPECIALIZED LITERATURE ON QUESTIONS RELATED TO CONSTITUTIONAL (OR MORE BROADLY FORMAL) EFFICACY HAVE ASSUMED CONCEPTUALIZATIONS THAT ARE THEORETICALLY PROBLEMATIC GIVEN THEIR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO THEORETICAL INCONSISTENCIES OR INACCURATE EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. TO EXEMPLIFY THIS POINT, I ANALYZE THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL EFFICACY USED IN TWO INFLUENTIAL POLITICAL SCIENCE TEXTS: BARRY WEINGAST'S" THE POLITICAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW" AND GRETCHEN HELMKE AND STEVEN LEVITSKY'S INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND DEMOCRACY. I ARGUE THAT THE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL (OR MORE BROADLY FORMAL) EFFICACY USED IN THEIR THEORETICAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY SUITED TO THEIR OWN RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, AND THAT THIS CONCEPTUAL MISFIT AFFECTS THE THEORETICAL CONSISTENCY AND EMPIRICAL APPLICABILITY OF THEIR CONCLUSIONS.
708	GIVEN THEIR INCREASING ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, EMERGING COUNTRIES SUCH AS PERU DEPEND ON THEIR EXPORT SECTOR. THIS RESEARCH EVALUATES THE LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY OF PERUVIAN EXPORTS (EF) AND THE IMPACT OF FOUR REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS (RTAS) (MERCOSUR, THE EU, THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (EFTA), AND THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY OF NATIONS (CAN)), TWELVE BILATERAL AGREEMENTS (BAS), THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE (ID), CULTURAL DISTANCE (CD), FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI), TRADE FREEDOM (TF), AND TRADITIONAL (TX) AND NONTRADITIONAL EXPORTS (NTX) BY SECTOR ON THE EXPORT EFFICIENCY OF PERU. THIS NON-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USED A DATASET OF 38 COUNTRIES FROM 1995 TO 2019. AN EXTENDED STOCHASTIC FRONTIER GRAVITY (SFGM) TEN-VARIABLE MODEL WITH THE ONE-STEP ESTIMATION METHOD WAS APPLIED TO ESTIMATE EXPORT EFFICIENCY. POISSON'S PML ESTIMATOR WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT EXPORT EFFICIENCY (EF). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE EXPORT EFFICIENCY OF PERU WAS MODERATE, RANGING BETWEEN 0.462 AND 0.458, WITH A STATIONARY TREND, INDICATING CONSIDERABLE EXPORT POTENTIAL BETWEEN PERU AND ITS TRADING PARTNERS. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS EFFICIENCY ARE ID (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL, NONADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW), NTX (CHEMICALS AND METAL MECHANICS), AND BA WITH AMERICAN COUNTRIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, CD (INDULGENCE, LONG-TERM ORIENTATION, INDIVIDUALISM, UNCERTAINTY, AND LACK OF A CULTURE OF ACHIEVEMENT), TF, AGREEMENTS WITH MERCOSUR AND THE EU, FDI, AND TX WEAKENED THE EFFICIENCY OF EXPORTS. FINALLY, CAN, EFTA, BA WITH ASIAN COUNTRIES, FDI, TX, AND WTO DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE EF. RECOMMENDATIONS TO POLICY MAKERS ARE PRESENTED.
709	ON 30 JUNE 2022, RUSSIA ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE DECREE WHICH TERMINATED THE PARTICIPATION OF MITSUI CORPORATION AND MITSUBISHI CORPORATION IN THE SAKHALIN-2 GAS PROJECT. THIS MEASURE APPEARS TO VIOLATE, INTER ALIA, ARTICLES 3(1) AND 5 FOR THE JAPAN-RUSSIA BIT DUE TO ITS APPARENT DISCRIMINATORY NATURE, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A RETALIATORY COUNTERMEASURE AGAINST JAPAN WHO FROZE RUSSIAN ASSETS IN PROTEST OF ITS INVASION OF UKRAINE. MITSUI AND MITSUBISHI HAVE NOT INITIATED ANY INVESTMENT ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AGAINST RUSSIA BEFORE ICSID, A RIGHT WHICH ARTICLE 11 OF THE BIT AFFORDS THEM. BASED ON PAST INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT JURISPRUDENCE, MITSUI AND MITSUBISHI APPEAR TO HAVE SOLID CLAIMS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN AWARDS IN THEIR FAVOUR. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IN A BID TO DEMONSTRATE TO ITS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW TO OTHER WATCHFUL INVESTORS, RUSSIA WOULD HAVE COMPENSATED THESE INVESTORS. HOWEVER, JUDGING BY RUSSIA'S RECENT INVASION OF UKRAINE, WHICH LED MANY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO SANCTION IT, RUSSIA DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY DESIRE TO APPEASE INVESTORS AND TO DEMONSTRATE ITS RESPECT FOR THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. ARTICLE 3 OF THE NEW YORK CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION PROVIDE AVENUES FOR ENFORCEMENT IN COURTS IN JAPAN AND IN THIRD COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND THE DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN ENFORCING ARBITRAL AWARDS AGAINST STATE ASSETS, THIS ARTICLE SUBMITS THAT DESPITE THE APPARENT BREACHES OF THE BIT, THESE INVESTORS WILL ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES IN ENFORCING ANY EVENTUAL ARBITRAL AWARDS HANDED DOWN BY A TRIBUNAL.
710	BACKGROUND THE PANDEMIC GENERATED BY COVID-19 HAS CHANGED THE WAY OF LIFE OF CITIZENS AROUND THE WORLD IN A SHORT TIME, AFFECTING ALL AREAS OF SOCIETY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, WHICH IS FACING A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS WITH DIFFERENT NATIONAL RESPONSES IMPLEMENTED BY GOVERNMENTS. SEVERAL MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC, THE FIRST AFTER-EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ARE BEGINNING TO BE FELT BY CITIZENS, WHO ARE QUESTIONING THE MANAGEMENT CARRIED OUT SO FAR. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF GOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC DURING THE COMING MONTHS, WE CALCULATED THE LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE IDENTIFY SOME COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAY CONDITION EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT. RESULTS WE OBTAINED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ACCORDING TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE COUNTRY, WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN COUNTRIES BEING LESS EFFICIENT THAN ASIAN AND AFRICAN COUNTRIES. LIKEWISE, WE CAN AFFIRM THAT GREATER FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, A HIGHER MEDIAN AGE AND AN UNSTABLE ECONOMY AND LABOR MARKET REDUCE EFFICIENCY. HOWEVER, FEMALE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT AND GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW OFFER MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT, AS DO COUNTRIES THAT DERIVE MORE REVENUES FROM TOURISM. CONCLUSIONS THESE RESULTS PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL LEADERS TO REFLECT ON THEIR MANAGEMENT DURING THESE MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY MISTAKES AND IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFECTIVE MEASURES. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT USING MORE RESOURCES DOES NOT MEAN MANAGING BETTER; THEREFORE, POLICYMAKERS NEED TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE USE OF RESOURCES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR.
711	BY FOREGROUNDING A WIDENED VIEW OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL PROCESSES, THE WORKS UNDER DISCUSSION IN THIS SYMPOSIUM CAN SUPPORT INNOVATIVE CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL HEALTH LAW -A FIELD THAT HAS GAINED WIDE ATTENTION DUE TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AROUND THE WORLD (LANDER, 2020; BHATT, 2020). LEGAL AND SOCIO-LEGAL SCHOLARS IN THE DECADE AND A HALF BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WORKED ON LOCATING GLOBAL HEALTH LAW AND ARTICULATING ITS UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES. LAWRENCE GOSTIN'S 2014 MONOGRAPH OFFERS A SYNOPTIC VIEW CENTRED ON INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS (E.G. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL) AND PROBLEMS (E.G. INFECTIOUS-DISEASE RESPONSE, TOBACCO CONTROL), ALONG WITH AN ELABORATION OF ITS NORMATIVE BASIS IN UNIVERSAL MORAL PRINCIPLE AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW (GOSTIN, 2014). STRUGGLES OVER ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL MEDICINES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE EARLY 2000S ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH CONSTRAINING INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. ANDREAS FISCHER-LESCANO AND GUENTHER TEUBNER'S 2004 READING IS ORIENTED MORE BY SOCIAL THEORY THAN BY DOCTRINAL OR ETHICAL FRAMES (FISCHER-LESCANO AND TEUBNER, 2004, PP. 1006, 1008). A FUNCTIONAL HEALTH REGIME HAS 'DIFFERENTIATED OUT', THEY OBSERVE, AND OPERATES AS A DISCRETE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ACROSS BORDERS, ALBEIT ONE THAT IS THREATENED BY THE PREPONDERANT ECONOMIC SYSTEM. ON THIS MODEL, THE BATTLE FOR ACCESS TO MEDICINES AMOUNTS TO ENSURING, VIA HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES, THAT THE RATIONALITY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS NOT REPLACED BY THAT OF ITS ECONOMIC RIVAL IN LEGAL AND POLICY COMMUNICATIONS (FISCHER-LESCANO AND TEUBNER, 2004, PP. 1030, 1046).
712	ENTRENCHMENT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO LAW. GRAND DOCUMENTS LIKE THE U.S. CONSTITUTION, AND MUNDANE ONES LIKE CITY AND CORPORATE CHARTERS, ENTRENCH THEMSELVES AGAINST CHANGE THROUGH SUPERMAJORITY RULES AND OTHER MECHANISMS. ENTRENCHMENT FRUSTRATES RESPONSIVENESS, BUT IT PROMOTES STABILITY, A RULE OF LAW VIRTUE EXTOLLED FOR CENTURIES. IT DOES SO THROUGH A STRAIGHTFORWARD CHANNEL: ENTRENCHED LAW IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE. SCHOLARS HAVE LONG UNDERSTOOD THIS IDEA, WHICH CAN BE CALLED THE FIRST STATUS QUO BIAS OF ENTRENCHMENT. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT A SECOND BIAS LURKS: ENTRENCHMENT MAKES CHANGES THAT DO TAKE PLACE INCREMENTAL. AS ENTRENCHMENT DEEPENS, THE SCOPE OF POTENTIAL CHANGE TO LAW COLLAPSES ON THE STATUS QUO. TO RESTATE THE IDEA, WHEN WE ENTRENCH LAW, WE PREVENT CHANGE, AT LEAST FOR A TIME, AND WE CONFINE ANY CHANGES THAT DO TAKE PLACE TO SMALL STEPS. THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, ESPECIALLY THE DEBATE ABOUT ARTICLE V AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, BOTH OF WHICH SHIELD THE CONSTITUTION FROM CHANGE MORE THAN SCHOLARS REALIZE. IT ALSO ILLUMINATES SEVERAL QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, SUCH AS WHY CONSTITUTIONS REMAIN UNPOPULAR AFTER AMENDMENT. FINALLY, IT GENERATES A THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL FAILURE. WHEN VOTERS' PREFERENCES EVOLVE CONSISTENTLY IN ONE DIRECTION, ENTRENCHED LAW EVENTUALLY BECOMES AS UNSTABLE AS ORDINARY LAW, ONLY LESS POPULAR. THUS, ENTRENCHMENT BUYS NEITHER STABILITY NOR RESPONSIVENESS. BECAUSE ENTRENCHMENT CONFINES LEGAL CHANGE TO INCREMENTAL STEPS, AMENDMENT CANNOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THIS RECASTS QUESTIONS OF LEGAL DESIGN IN NEW LIGHT, AND IT MAY EXPLAIN WHY SOME CONSTITUTIONS ENDURE WHILE OTHERS COLLAPSE.
713	THIS SUMMARY REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE CONFLUENCE OF CONTINUED DOWNWARD PRESSURES AND DEFLATION SCARES IN THE FACE OF LOOMING UNCERTAINTY IN CHINA'S KEY MACROECONOMIC LANDSCAPES. COUNTERFACTUAL ANALYSES AND POLICY SIMULATIONS ARE CONDUCTED, IN ADDITION TO BENCHMARK FORECASTS, BASED ON IAR-CMM MODEL AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH CYCLICAL AND SECULAR FACTORS. ECONOMIC DECELERATION IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM, WITH REAL GDP GROWTH DECLINING TO 6.3% (5.5% USING MORE RELIABLE INSTEAD OF OFFICIAL DATA) IN 2016 AND FACING A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SLIDING FURTHER DOWN IN 2017. FIVE KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE WEAK OUTLOOK, ADDITIONAL TO FRICTIONS AND IMPEDIMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC TRANSITION/RESTRUCTURING AND LACKLUSTER DOMESTIC/EXTERNAL DEMANDS, ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUDING: LACK OF NEW GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT ENGINE, EXHAUSTION OF GOVERNMENT-LED DRIVING FORCE, THE CROWDING-OUT OF PRIVATE SECTORS BY STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) WITH EXCESS CAPACITY\ CAPITAL OVERHANG, NONPERFORMING GOVERNMENT SECTORS AND OFFICIALS, AND TWIST OR MISINTERPRETATION OF THE " NEW NORMAL." A ROOT CAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS, LYING WITH SLUGGISHNESS IN CHINA'S TRANSFORMATION INTO A MARKET BASED ECONOMY, HAS TO DO WITH OVERPOWERED GOVERNMENT BUT UNDERPOWERED MARKET IN RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND GOVERNMENT UNDERPERFORMANCE IN ENFORCING INTEGRITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE MARKETPLACE AND IN PROVIDING PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES. AT THE NEXUS BETWEEN INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION ARE MARKET ORIENTED AND RULE OF LAW GOVERNED STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT. AS SUCH, FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT DIALECTICALLY BALANCE DEMAND AND SUPPLY SIDE FACTORS AND PROPERLY WEIGH SHORT RUN STABILIZATION AGAINST LONG RUN DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO THE TOP OF THE AGENDA.
714	THIS PAPER MEANS TO DEMONSTRATE THE THEORETICAL-AND-METHODOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF THOUGHT ABOUT CULTURE. EMPLOYING AN END-MEANS AND ABSOLUTE VALUE PLUS CONCEPT OF REALITY APPROACH, THE CONTINUOUS MODEL OF CULTURE AIMS TO EMBRACE FROM ONE HOLISTIC STANDPOINT VARIOUS CONCEPTS AND DEBATES OF THE MODERN HUMAN, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL SCIENCES. THE PAPER REVISITS THE FACT VERSUS VALUE, NATURE VERSUS CULTURE, CULTURE VERSUS STRUCTURE, AGENCY VERSUS STRUCTURE, AND ECONOMICS VERSUS POLITICS DEBATES AND OFFERS THE CONCEPTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, STATE CAPITALISM, A DIALECTICAL MODEL OF PROGRESS, AND INTERPRETATIVE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, AS WELL AS OF CULTURAL DIFFUSION, AUTONOMY, ALIENATION, AND INDIVIDUALITY. THIS MODEL DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE IDEAL-SYMBOLICAL AND THE INSTRUMENTAL FUNCTIONS OF CULTURE, SEES CULTURE AS BEING SEWN FROM UNIVERSAL BINARIES, AND PROVIDES A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF A VALUE JUDGMENT, WITH POSITIVISM SO FAR VAGUE ABOUT THE TOPIC. IT, TOO, SUGGESTS AN EXTRA METHOD FOR INVESTIGATING CULTURE(S): THE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDY OF CULTURE(S) ENABLES SOCIAL SCIENCE TO VIEW LITERATURE AS ITS POTENTIAL IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWEE-A CASE FOR ARGUING FOR A CERTAIN CONCEPTION OF INTERDISCIPLINARITY AS WELL. IN ADDITION, IT PREDICTS THAT CULTURAL PARTICULARISM OR INDIVIDUALITY REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. ANALYZING THE ISSUE OF EUROCENTRISM IN SOCIAL SCIENCE, THE MODEL FINDS MODERNITY'S CONCEPT OF REALITY TO BE INVOLVED IN "METHODOLOGICAL" INTELLECTUALISTIC REDUCTIONISM, CHARACTERIZING IT SINCE THE EMPIRICISM/RATIONALISM ORIGINATION. SYSTEMATICALLY CONFUSING THE UNIVERSAL OPPOSITIONS IN A EUROCENTRIC MANNER, INTELLECTUALISM BECOMES A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN UNFOLDING POST-MODERNITY.
715	ARCHIVES ARE FACING MANY CHALLENGES AS INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND INCREASING SOCIETAL DIVERSITY. THESE TWO TRENDS ASK FOR DECIDED MEASURES, ONE IN TERMS OF SELECTION AND THE OTHER IN TERMS OF EXPANDED INFORMATION PRESERVATION TO DOCUMENT ALL SOCIETAL GROUPS APPROPRIATELY. THESE OPPOSING TRENDS FORCE ARCHIVISTS TO RETHINK PERMANENTLY THEIR APPRAISAL POLITICS AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL ORIENTATION. BASIC ARCHIVAL FUNCTIONS HAVE TO BE ALIGNED ON ONE HAND WITH SERVICES FOR AN ORGANISATION RELATED TO DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND ON THE OTHER HAND WITH A MEMORY POLITICS AIMING AT AN EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION OF THE ENORMOUS SOCIETAL DIVERSITY BY PRESERVING THE (CULTURAL) PATRIMONY OF ALL GROUPS TO FACILITATE THEIR IDENTITY-BUILDING. BY LOOKING BACK IN OUR INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY AND COMPARING THE SWISS AND THE CANADIAN APPROACH IN APPRAISAL AS WELL AS THE LARGER POLITICAL CONTEXT OF DOCUMENTING, WE AIM TO SHOW THAT A CLEAR FUNCTIONAL ORIENTATION, A TRANSPARENT AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESS OF SELECTION, A COOPERATIVE APPROACH IN FULFILLING EXISTING CHALLENGES AND DUTIES AS WELL AS A SOUND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL PAST HELP TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHOICES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS, FIRSTLY, THAT ARCHIVES AS MULTIFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS SERVE THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW, AND SECONDLY, THAT BY SELECTING DOCUMENTS FOR PRESERVATION AND BY REDUCING THE MASS OF INFORMATION, WE NONETHELESS WILL PRESERVE AN ABUNDANT DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE, WHICH WILL NOT ONLY SERVE TO STABILIZE SOCIETAL (OR COMMUNITARIAN) IDENTITY BUT IT WILL STILL SERVE AS A RESERVOIR FEEDING ESSENTIAL SCEPTICISM AS AN ENGINE FOR PROGRESS.
716	IN BOTH HAMDAN V. RUMSFELD AND SANCHEZ-LLAMAS V. OREGON, GOVERNMENT BRIEFS ASSERTED THAT THERE IS A "LONG-ESTABLISHED PRESUMPTION" THAT TREATIES DO NOT CREATE JUDICIALLY-ENFORCEABLE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IN HIS DISSENT IN SANCHEZ-LLAMAS, JUSTICE BREYER CHALLENGED THIS CLAIM. THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD ADOPT SUCH A PRESUMPTION IS PART OF A BROADER CONFLICT BETWEEN THE "NATIONALIST" AND "TRANSNATIONALIST" MODELS OF TREATY ENFORCEMENT. THE TRANSNATIONALIST MODEL APPLIES A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF DOMESTIC JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF TREATY-BASED INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IN CONTRAST, THE NATIONALIST MODEL APPLIES A PRESUMPTION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL REMEDIES FOR TREATY VIOLATIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE HISTORICAL FOUNDATIONS OF BOTH MODELS. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT DOCTRINES INVOLVING THE DOMESTIC JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF TREATIES HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. BETWEEN 1789 AND 1975, THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE JUDICIAL DECISION ENDORSING THE NATIONALIST PRESUMPTION AGAINST PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT OF TREATY RIGHTS. IN CONTRAST, THERE WERE DOZENS OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT APPLIED THE TRANSNATIONALIST PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF DOMESTIC JUDICIAL REMEDIES. ALTHOUGH THE NATIONALIST PRESUMPTION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL ENFORCEMENT OF TREATIES HAS GAINED WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE IN THE LOWER COURTS IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS, THE SUPREME COURT HAS NEVER ENDORSED THAT PRESUMPTION. THE COURTS DECISIONS IN HAMDAN AND SANCHEZ-LLAMAS DECLINED TO ENDORSE EITHER THE NATIONALIST OR TRANSNATIONALIST PRESUMPTION, BUT THE COURT'S ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NATIONALIST AND TRANSNATIONALIST MODELS WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. FOREIGN RELATIONS, SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
717	WITH THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE EMBARKED ON IMPLEMENTING JUDICIAL REFORMS TO REDESIGN JUSTICE-SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AND BUILD UP THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGION. REFORM EFFORTS INCLUDED EMPOWERING THE COURTS, GRANTING POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, PROFESSIONALIZING THE PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES AND IMPLEMENTING THE ACCUSATORY CRIMINAL SYSTEM IN JUSTICE-SECTOR INSTITUTIONS. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE REFORMS TARGETED AT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES CHANGING THE WAY LEGAL DEFENSE IS PROVIDED? IN THIS ARTICLE, AFTER DISCUSSING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT CAPTURES AND OPERATIONALIZES THE CONCEPTS OF A MERIT-BASED CAREER SYSTEM, AN ACCUSATORY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND EFFECTIVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION, I EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CHANGES OF TRANSITIONING FROM AN INQUISITORIAL TO AN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM AND FROM A NON-MERIT-BASED CAREER SYSTEM TO A MERIT-BASED CAREER SYSTEM HAVE AFFECTED THE WAY LEGAL COUNSEL IS PROVIDED AT SUBNATIONAL PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, I PROVIDE BOTH A DE JURE AND DE FACTO MEASURES (INDICATORS OF REFORM IMPLEMENTATION). TO IDENTIFY THE DE JURE INDICATORS, I CONSULTED LEGAL TEXTS (CONSTITUTIONS AND SECONDARY LAWS), AND TO GAUGE HOW THE DE FACTO INDICATORS WORK, I RELIED ON INTERVIEWS WITH PUBLIC DEFENDERS, REPORTS AND ACADEMIC DOCUMENTS. I COLLECTED 50 INTERVIEWS WITH PUBLIC DEFENSE ATTORNEYS FROM THREE MEXICAN STATES: BAJA CALIFORNIA SUR, JALISCO AND NUEVO LEON. FINDINGS FROM THESE STATES SUGGEST THAT AS REFORM IMPLEMENTATION ADVANCES, PUBLIC DEFENDERS HAVE MORE TOOLS TO OFFER LEGAL REPRESENTATION; MORE SPECIFICALLY, THEY ARE BETTER TRAINED, IN ADDITION TO HAVING HIGHER SALARIES, A LOWER CASELOAD PER DEFENDER AND INCREASED ACCESS TO FORENSIC SERVICES.
718	IN TIMES OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, IN WHICH THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS GAINS PROMINENCE, MAINLY DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS INCREASING SOCIAL INEQUALITY, AND THE DAMAGE FALLS PRIMA FACIE ON THE LESS FAVORED POPULATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WITH FAIR DISTRIBUTION. THE WEALTH OF MODERN SOCIETIES, MAKING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMPATIBLE WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO ANALYZE HOW THE BRAZILIAN STATE, AS A NATION GUIDED BY VALUES LINKED TO SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND SOLIDARITY, CONSTITUTIONALLY CONFORMED TO THE PARADIGM OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, SHOULD DISTRIBUTE ITS WEALTH FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TO BE OF EVERYONE AS A WAY OF IMPLEMENTING THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEALS AND OBJECTIVES OF SOCIETY, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PRESENTED ITSELF THROUGH REGIONAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES. WHEN CONSIDERING THE OCCURRENCE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS, SUCH AS HOUSING AND THE ENVIRONMENT, IT IS QUESTIONED WHICH CRITERION SHOULD GUIDE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THESE RIGHTS. THE BASIC HYPOTHESIS THAT GUIDES THIS RESEARCH IS THAT THE EQUALITY, COOPERATION AND PARTICIPATION OF SOCIETY IN THE CHOICES WILL LEAD TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, GUARANTEEING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. FOR THAT, THE LEGAL-THEORETICAL METHOD AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH TECHNIQUE WERE USED, HAVING AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THE WORK A THEORY OF JUSTICE BY RAWLS. IN THE END, IT APPEARS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENFORCE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO HOUSING AND TO A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT IF SOCIETY IS A COLLECTIVE COOPERATIVE ENTERPRISE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL.
719	IN THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS, ARISTOTLE DEFINED "EQUITY" AS THE PROCESS THAT INTERVENES WHEN LAW FAILS BECAUSE OF ITS GENERALITY. EQUITY IS LARGELY ASSUMED TO BE THE PROVINCE OF COURTS AND FRAMED PRIMARILY AS THE DOMAIN OF JUDGES: SHOULD THE COURT APPLY A GENERAL LAW WHEN ITS APPLICATION RESULTS IN UNFORESEEN OR UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES? BUT EQUITY OPERATES OUTSIDE THE COURTS ALSO. WITHIN LEGISLATURES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, EQUITY OPERATES TO MAKE GENERAL LAWS MORE SPECIFIC, CREATE EXCEPTIONS, AND PASS NARROWING AMENDMENTS OR REGULATIONS. IN FACT, THE LION'S SHARE OF EQUITABLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE OUTSIDE THE COURTS FOR MUCH OF THIS NATION'S HISTORY. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THESE HISTORIES TO EXPAND THE FIELD WITHIN WHICH EQUITY IS IDENTIFIED TO INCLUDE LEGISLATURES AND AGENCIES. BY CONTRAST TO THE COURT-CENTERED FUNCTIONAL ACCOUNT OF "EQUITY," EQUITY OUTSIDE THE COURTS IS A DYNAMIC AND DISCURSIVE PRACTICE-NOT SIMPLY A PROCESS-THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ENGAGE IN AS THEY LOBBY OR PETITION FOR EXCEPTIONS OR AMENDMENTS TO GENERAL LAWS-EITHER NEW OR PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED OR PASSED. BECAUSE THESE INSTITUTIONS AIM TO BE "REPRESENTATIVE," EQUITY WITHIN LEGISLATURES AND AGENCIES HAS FULFILLED A REPRESENTATIVE FUNCTION AND HAS ALLOWED MARGINALIZED AND SUBORDINATED GROUPS TO SHAPE LAW AND SHIFT POWER. YET, SEEKING EQUITY OFTEN PUSHES LAWS TOWARD SPECIFICITY AND AWAY FROM THE IDEAL OF GENERALITY IDENTIFIED BY LON FULLER AND OTHERS-THEREBY RAISING RULE OF LAW CONCERNS. A LESS COURT-CENTERED ACCOUNT OF EQUITY TEACHES THAT THE GENERALITY PRINCIPLE MIGHT OVERLOOK EQUITY'S REPRESENTATIONAL FUNCTION-INTEGRAL WHEN MAKING LAW TO GOVERN PLURAL JURISDICTIONS.
720	WORLDWIDE, AS WILD-CAUGHT COMMERCIAL FISHERIES PLATEAU AND HUMAN DEMANDS FOR PROTEIN INCREASE, MARINE AQUACULTURE IS EXPANDING. MUCH MARINE AQUACULTURE IS INHERENTLY ADAPTABLE TO CHANGING CLIMATIC AND CHEMICAL CONDITIONS. NEVERTHELESS, SITING OF MARINE AQUACULTURE OPERATIONS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETING ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DEMANDS UPON AND PRIORITIES FOR OCEAN SPACE, WHILE SOME FORMS OF MARINE AQUACULTURE CAN ALSO IMPOSE OTHER EXTERNALITIES ON MARINE SYSTEMS, SUCH AS POLLUTION FROM WASTES (NUTRIENTS) AND ANTIBIOTICS, CONSUMPTION OF WILD FISH AS FOOD, AND INTRODUCTION OF NON-NATIVE OR GENETICALLY MODIFIED SPECIES. AS A RESULT, GOVERNMENTAL POLICY DECISIONS TO PROMOTE BOTH MARINE AQUACULTURE THAT CAN ADAPT TO A CHANGING OCEAN AND ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE FOR THAT AQUACULTURE CAN BECOME CONTESTED, REQUIRING ATTENTION TO THEIR SOCIAL LEGITIMACY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE LAW CAN PROMOTE THE ADAPTABILITY OF MARINE AQUACULTURE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION-ADAPTIVE MARINE AQUACULTURE-WHILE STILL PRESERVING KEY RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, SUCH AS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. PERHAPS MOST OBVIOUSLY, LAW CAN ESTABLISH SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR MARINE AQUACULTURE THAT MINIMIZE ITS IMPACTS, PROMOTING MARINE RESILIENCE OVERALL. HOWEVER, TO FOSTER TRULY ADAPTIVE MARINE AQUACULTURE, INCLUDING ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS, COASTAL NATIONS SHOULD ALSO PROCEDURALLY REFORM THEIR MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO LEGALLY CONNECT THE PROCEDURES FOR AQUACULTURE PERMITTING, MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING (MSP), AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT. THE GOALS FOR SUCH CONNECTIONS, MOREOVER, SHOULD BE TO MANDATE NEW FORUMS FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND CREATIVE COLLABORATION, PROMOTE EXPERIMENTATION WITH ACCOUNTABILITY THAT LEADS TO INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AND FOSTER THE EMERGENCE OF ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE REGARDING THE USE OF MARINE SPACE.
721	IN 2014 THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT CALLED ON SCHOOLS TO ACTIVELY PROMOTE FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES (FBVS), SEEING THIS AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO PREVENT THE RADICALISATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THESE VALUES TO INCLUDE DEMOCRACY, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND RELIGIONS. RATHER THAN CRITICISING THIS POLICY ON THEORETICAL OR IDEOLOGICAL GROUNDS, AS MANY STUDIES HAVE DONE, THE CURRENT ARTICLE AIMS TO ASCERTAIN SUPPORT FOR THE VALUES LABELLED AS FUNDAMENTALLY BRITISH AMONG 23 YEAR OLDS IN ENGLAND AND TO ASSESS WHETHER LEVELS OF SUPPORT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND DISTINCT EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN LIFE. DATA FROM THE CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION LONGITUDINAL STUDY (CELS) ARE ANALYSED FOR THESE PURPOSES. A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MEASURE OF FBVS IS CONSTRUCTED BASED ON POLICY UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE TERM RATHER THAN STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR FBVS AMONG 23 YEAR OLDS ARE ALREADY VERY HIGH AND DO NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE WHITE BRITISH MAJORITY AND VARIOUS MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES OF THE LATTER DO NOT ALLOW FOR STRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THESE DIFFERENCES. AMONG THE EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND PARTICULARLY TRACK ATTENDED APPEARS TO BE THE ONLY INFLUENTIAL CONDITION, WITH THOSE OBTAINING ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS SHOWING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SUPPORT FOR FBVS THAN THOSE ACHIEVING VOCATIONAL ONES. ADDING THIS VARIABLE TO THE MODEL NEUTRALISES THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMMES OR PEDAGOGIES EXPERIENCED DURING LOWER SECONDARY, SUCH AS CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION, AN OPEN CLIMATE OF CLASSROOM DISCUSSION OR SCHOOL-BASED POLITICAL ACTIVITIES.
722	MYTHS MATTER. THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO CONFRONT A POWERFUL MYTH THAT PERVADES MODERN ECONOMIC, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND LEGAL DISCOURSE: THE MYTH OF FREE. THE PREVAILING VIEW IS THAT CONSUMERS CAPTURE MASSIVE WELFARE SURPLUS FROM A FLOOD OF INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE. ECONOMISTS, LEGAL SCHOLARS, AND INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS CREATED AN ORIGIN STORY-A MYTH-TO EXPLAIN HOW THESE PRODUCTS BECAME "FREE." BUT THAT ORTHODOX ORIGIN STORY IS FATALLY FLAWED. THIS ARTICLE FORMALIZES, THEN DEBUNKS, THE MYTH OF FREE AND ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS. THE MYTH IS RIDDLED WITH INTERNAL INCONSISTENCIES, LOGICAL ERRORS, AND FACTUAL INACCURACIES. IN THEIR PLACE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A REVISIONIST HISTORY OF FREE, ONE THAT OFFERS GREATER DESCRIPTIVE AND PREDICTIVE ACCURACY. ALONG THE WAY, IT SOLVES SEVERAL PUZZLES: WHY HAS FREE BECOME THE DEFAULT ONLINE BUSINESS MODEL? WHY DOES THE AGE OF ABUNDANCE-SO OFTEN PREDICTED-ALWAYS FAIL TO MATERIALIZE? AND WHY IS SOCIETY NONETHELESS DRAWN TO SUCH PREDICTIONS? THE TASK IS URGENT: THE MYTH OF FREE IS NOT BENIGN. IT HAS MISLED COURTS INTO GRANTING PROTECTED LEGAL STATUS TO FREE-PRODUCT SUPPLIERS IN CASES RANGING FROM CONTRACT DISPUTES TO ANTITRUST AND PRIVACY LITIGATION. IT HAS ALSO MOTIVATED POLICY PROPOSALS THAT CALL FOR ELIMINATING MARKET INTERVENTIONS-OR COMPETITIVE MARKETS THEMSELVES-WITHOUT ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION IN EITHER CASE. MOREOVER, POLICIES DESIGNED FOR A POST-SCARCITY WORLD NECESSARILY OVERLOOK THE PERSISTENT PROBLEMS ATTENDANT TO SCARCITY, THEREBY CREATING SUBSTANTIAL ALLOCATIVE INEFFICIENCIES. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DISPEL THE MYTH OF FREE BEFORE IT CAN WREAK FURTHER HARM TO SOCIETAL WELFARE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
723	IN RECENT YEARS, CHINA HAS REPEATEDLY PRESSURED ITS NEIGHBOURS TO RETURN CHINESE ASYLUM SEEKERS, EVEN WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS MERIT PROTECTION UNDER THE REFUGEE CONVENTION. THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH PRESSURE ARE SERIOUS, BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED, WHO HAVE IN MANY CASES BEEN IMPRISONED OR EXECUTED UPON REPATRIATION, AND FOR THE REFUGEE SYSTEMS OF CHINA'S NEIGHBOURS, WHICH STRUGGLE TO FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FACE OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE. WHILE THIS CHINESE PRESSURE HAS OFTEN BEEN CONDEMNED BY HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS, THERE HAS SO FAR BEEN LITTLE ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE PERMISSIBILITY OF SUCH PRESSURE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION BY ANALYSING FIVE POSSIBLE LEGAL THEORIES FOR THE ILLEGALITY OF CHINESE PRESSURE: NAMELY THAT IT VIOLATES THE SPECIFIC PROHIBITION ON TREATING A GRANT OF ASYLUM AS AN UNFRIENDLY ACT; THAT IT VIOLATES THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERVENTION IN ANOTHER STATE'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS; THAT IT VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD FAITH FULFILMENT OF TREATY OBLIGATIONS; THAT IT INVOKES INDIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATION OF REFUGEE LAW NORMS; AND THAT IT VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, SPECIFICALLY THE RIGHT TO LEAVE ANY COUNTRY AND THE RIGHT TO SEEK ASYLUM. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT CHINESE PRESSURE VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD FAITH FULFILMENT OF TREATY OBLIGATIONS, BUT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONVINCINGLY ARGUE THE ILLEGALITY OF CHINESE PRESSURE UNDER THE OTHER FOUR LEGAL THEORIES - ALTHOUGH THEY MAY PROVIDE AMMUNITION FOR ACTIVISTS TO CONDEMN THE POLITICAL HYPOCRISY OF CHINA'S ACTIONS.
724	THIS QUALITATIVE RESEARCH AIMS TO REVIEW THE PROBLEM OF POST-MORTEM ORGANS DONATION IN BRAZIL, BROUGHT WITH THE INVERSION OF PRESUMED CONSENT SYSTEM, OCCURRED WITH LAW NO. 10.211/2001, WHICH AMENDED ARTICLE 4 OF LAW NO. 9.434/97. THIS CHANGE GAVE THE DECEASED'S FAMILY THE FINAL DECISION ON DONATION, BASED ON PERSONALITY'S RIGHTS - WHICH, PARADOXICALLY, MAY CONTRADICT THE DECISION TAKEN BY THE DECEASED TO GRANT HIS MORTAL REMAINS FOR ALTRUISTIC PURPOSES. BESIDES, THERE IS AN ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONCERN REGARDING TO THE PRESUMED CONSENT OF THE HUMAN BODY AS A RES COMMUNITATIS - DESPITE BEING IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY TO GUIDE THE [SOCIAL] STATE IN THE CONCRETIZATION OF THE RIGHTS TO HEALTH AND TO LIFE. THIS WORK STARTS FROM THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE FAMILY LIBERTY OF CHOICE IN DONATION OF POST-MORTEM ORGANS COULD NOT SUPPLANT THE AUTONOMY OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGISTERS HIS DESIRE TO BE A DONOR. IN ADDITION, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS POSSIBILITY COULD INCREASE, ALBEIT VIRTUALLY, THE EFFICIENCY POTENTIAL OF POST MORTEM DONATION PUBLIC POLICIES IN BRAZIL - WHICH JUSTIFIES THIS INVESTIGATION. THUS, AS A METHOD OF APPROACH THE DIALECTICAL METHOD WAS ADOPTED AND AS A RESEARCH TECHNIQUE THE LEGAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDIRECT DOCUMENTATION, SEEKING A NORMATIZATION (STATIC AND EXEGETICAL) THAT CONFER GREATER EFFICIENCY TO THE RIGHTS TO HEALTH AND LIFE, MATERIALIZED THROUGH PUBLIC POLICIES OF POST MORTEM DONATION, WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL MOLDS OF A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW - THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT FAMILY LIBERALITY SHOULD ONLY BE GIVEN SUBSIDIARILY, IF ABSENT THE DECEASED'S REGISTERED MANIFESTATION OF DONATION.
725	UNITY AND PEACE IN EUROPE, FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN EASTERN EUROPE: GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION'S FOUNDING EDITOR GHITA IONESCU - THE CENTENARY OF WHOSE BIRTH THIS SPECIAL ISSUE COMMEMORATES - MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTENTED TO SEE THAT TWO OF HIS MAIN IDEALS HAVE NOW BY AND LARGE BEEN REALIZED. AT THE SAME TIME, IN CONTEMPORARY EUROPE WE CAN OBSERVE A HUGE VARIETY OF FORMS OF OPPOSITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL HOLDERS OF POWER, WHO APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RESPOND SUCCESSFULLY TO NEW AND PRESSING SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. THE OLD CONVICTIONS THAT ONCE CHARACTERIZED POLITICS IN THE EUROPEAN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ARE GRADUALLY ERODING, WHILE THE VOLATILE AND FRAGMENTED POLITIES OF THE NEW POST-COMMUNIST DEMOCRACIES IN THE EAST ARE ONLY ADDING TO THE INCREASED UNCERTAINTIES. THE ONGOING FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES HAVE EXACERBATED MANY OF THE EXISTING TENSIONS, BETWEEN NEW AND OLD GENERATIONS, BETWEEN GROUPS WITH LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND BETWEEN THE DOMESTIC AND SUPRA-NATIONAL LEVELS. EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ARE THUS HAVING TO CONTEND WITH VARIOUS CHALLENGES THAT ARE AIMED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AT THE CORE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE POPULIST DISREGARD FOR SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE VARIETY OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS CHALLENGING THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF A DISCREDITED FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CLASS, AND THE UNCLEAR OUTCOMES OF FURTHER EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SPECIAL ISSUE SUGGEST, THESE DEVELOPMENTS MAY CAST A DIFFERENT LIGHT ON OUR EMPIRICAL AND NORMATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EUROPEAN MODELS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE WELFARE STATE
726	THE AUTHOR PRESENTS IN HIS PAPER THE REASONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PROMPTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION IN SLOVENIA. HE STATES THAT FINANCIAL (ECONOMIC) CRIME AND CORRUPTION TAKE PLACE ALSO IN SLOVENIA THROUGH INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, MOST OFTEN INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL ELEMENTS AND THE NEW, SO FAR UNKNOWN MODES OF OPERATION ILLEGAL BENEFITS HAVE GROWN IN COMPARISON WITH THE PAST PERIOD AND REPRESENT AN INCREASING THREAT TO THE FUNCTIONING OF A RULE-OF-LAW STATE AND WELFARE STATE. ORGANISED CRIME (DRUGS, TRAFFICKING IN ARMS, TRAFFICKING IN HAZARDOUS WASTE, ORGANISATION OF ILLEGAL CROSSING OF A STATE BORDER, EXTORTION ETC) HAS GAINED INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS A DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND THE MASSIVE USE OF INTERNET HAVE GIVEN RISE TO THE PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY CRIME, USED FOR THE COMMISSION OF FINANCIAL CRIME, CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, RACIAL INTOLERANCE, TERRORISM, TRAFFICKING IN STOLEN GOODS, ILLEGAL DRUGS ETC TERRORISM HAS BECOME A MAJOR THREAT TO SECURITY AND HAS BEEN EVER MORE CONNECTED WITH VARIOUS FORMS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THE PRESENT ORGANISATION OF SLOVENE CRIMINAL POLICE HAS NOT ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THE DESCRIBED CHANGES AND HAS NOT BEEN ADAPTED TO THEM ON THE BASIS OF STATISTICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE METHODS, THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES IN HIS PAPER NEW FORMS OF CRIME IN SLOVENIA AND PRESENTS THE ANALYSIS OF CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES THAT DICTATED THE ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST NEW UNCONVENTIONAL FORMS OF CRIME IN THE PAPER ARE ALSO ANALYSED EUROPEAN ORGANISATIONAL MODELS OF CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANISATIONS AND COMPARED TO THE SLOVENE MODEL OF THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
727	THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES THAT HAVE COMPARED THE UAE AND PAKISTAN. THIS IS SURPRISING, GIVEN THAT THESE STATES ENJOY CLOSE RELATIONS, WHILE HAVING DISTINCTIVE DIFFERENCES. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ELUCIDATE A CLEAR THEORY OF STATE FORMATION IN THE POLITICAL AND HISTORICAL ROUTES TO MODERNITY AND IDENTITY IN POST-COLONIAL STATES WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE) AND PAKISTAN, AND WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE INFLUENCE OF RELIGION (ISLAM) IN STATE FORMATION. WHAT KINDS OF FACTORS ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN OUTCOMES? THE ARTICLE EMPHASISES THE LESSONS THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM A SUCCESSFUL STATE (LIKE THE UAE) FOR A LESS SUCCESSFUL STATE (LIKE PAKISTAN) THAT IS CONTINUALLY UNDERMINED BY BOTH FACTIONALISM AND RELIGIOUS/ TRIBAL FORMATIONS. ALTHOUGH I STOP SHORT OF CALLING PAKISTAN A 'FAILED' STATE, I DO EXAMINE THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND DILEMMAS THE GOVERNMENT HAS FACED -AND CONTINUES TO CONFRONT - IN SEEKING TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL ITS TERRITORY. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UAE AND PAKISTAN HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED IN THE CONTEXT OF BOTH MODERNISATION AND GLOBALISATION. I CONCLUDE THAT, LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF MODERNISATION AND GLOBALISATION, SECULARISATION -THE PUBLIC DECLINE OF RELIGIOSITY - HAS RESULTED IN A FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL STATE IN THE UAE THAN IN PAKISTAN. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS: (1) WHY THIS IS THE CASE; AND (2) UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS IT HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF THIS ACCOUNT HOPEFULLY LEAD TO A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF: (1) STATE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN BOTH COUNTRIES; AND (2) THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THIS CONTEXT.
728	INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT ADDRESSING PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IS A NECESSARY STEP IN THE PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND NATION BUILDING. HOW WAS POST-APARTHEID, DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA TO DEAL WITH ITS PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS? WOULD IT GO THE WAY OF RETRIBUTION IN ORDER TO SETTLE THE SCORES OF THE PAST? WOULD IT GO THE WAY OF BLANKET AMNESTY IN THE NAME OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY AND IGNORE THE FATE OF ITS VICTIMS? THE PROMOTION OF NATIONAL UNITY AND RECONCILIATION, ACT 34 OF 1995, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE TRC ENVISAGED THAT NATIONAL UNITY AND RECONCILIATION COULD BE PROMOTED BY DETERMINING THE EXTENT, AND THE FATE AND WHEREABOUTS OF THE VICTIMS, OF SUCH HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS; GIVING OPPORTUNITY FOR STORY-TELLING; RECOMMENDING REPARATIONS AND MEASURES TO PREVENT FUTURE VIOLATIONS; AND BY PROVIDING A FULL REPORT. IN ORDER TO DO SO THE COMMISSION HAD THE POWER TO GRANT AMNESTY TO THOSE MAKING SUCH DISCLOSURES. THIS ARTICLE, WHILE NOT UNCRITICAL OF THE COMMISSION, IS GENERALLY POSITIVE ABOUT ITS CONTRIBUTION BOTH IN ATTEMPTING TO DEAL WITH THE PAST, AND IN BUILDING A DEMOCRATIC, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CULTURE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. IT EXAMINES THE DEFINITIONS OF RECONCILIATION THAT EMERGED DURING THE COMMISSION IN THE LIGHT OF A CHRISTIAN DEFINITION WHERE RECONCILIATION IS SEEN TO BE BETWEEN GOD, OTHERS AND SELF, AND INVOLVES INTEGRATION WITH THE HUMAN COMMUNITY. THIS INTEGRATION INVOLVES TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PAST, CONFESSION AND REPENTANCE, FORGIVING AND BEING FORGIVEN, MAKING RESTITUTION WHERE POSSIBLE, ONGOING TRANSFORMATION IN THE PRESENT AND HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.
729	IN RESPONSE TO THE 1993 KIDNAPPING AND KILLING OF TWELVE-YEAR-OLD POLLY KLAAS, CALIFORNIA ENACTED A RIGID MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING LAW KNOWN AS TILL-CC STRIKES. THE PRODUCT OF PUBLIC FEAR AND POLITICAL EXPLOITATION, THREE STRIKES ENGENDERED LITTLE RATIONAL DEBATE PRIOR TO PASSAGE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE LAW'S SCOPE WAS FAR BROADER THAN CALIFORNIANS ANTICIPATED, AND PRIMARILY INCARCERATED NONVIOLENT FELONS. IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE LAW'S PASSAGE, CONCERNS ABOUT LOST PROPORTIONALITY AND THE SYSTEMIC COSTS OF THREE STRIKES LED TO WIDESPREAD ADAPTATION OF THE LAW. WHILE MODIFICATION OF THREE STRIKES IS UNIVERSAL ACROSS THE STATE, THE EXTENT OF ADAPTATION VARIES COUNTY BY COUNTY, AS EACH COUNTY'S PROSECUTORS ENFORCE THE LAW ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PRINCIPLES OF PROPORTIONALITY. IN THIS NOTE, JOSHUA BOWERS ANALYZES THE RESULTING GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITY IN THE CALIFORNIA THREE STRIKES LAW AND SUGGESTS THAT BY, APPLYING THE THREE STRIKES LAW ACCORDING TO PERSONAL AND LOCAL PRINCIPLES, PROSECUTORS ARE IMPROPERLY USURPING THE LEGISLATIVE POWER TO DETERMINE A SINGLE, COHERENT PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONAL PUNISHMENT. HE MAINTAINS THAT VARYING APPROACHES TO THREE STRIKES RENDER THE LAW A KIND OF "CHECKERBOARD STATUTE," VIOLATING WHAT RONALD DWORKIN CALLS THE VALUE OF INTEGRITY IN THE RULE OF LAW. TO REMEDY, THIS PROBLEM, CALIFORNIA COUNTIES MUST APPLY, THE THREE STRIKES LAW IN A SINGLE, UNIFORM MANNER. BOWERS CONCLUDES THAT IT IS NEITHER DESIRABLE NOR FEASIBLE FOR PROSECUTORS UNIFORMLY TO APPLY THE THREE STRIKES LAW AS WRITTEN. INSTEAD, TO ENSURE CONSISTENT APPLICATION, THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MUST CHANGE THE LAW TO REFLECT BETTER A PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY ACCEPTABLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.
730	THE CURRENT REPURPOSING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFET UTILE OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW CAN BE FOUND IN THE REVOLUTIONARY STEPS TAKEN BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN ITS APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 19 TEU. THE IMPLICIT GOAL OF THIS RECENT BODY OF CASE-LAW IS TO EQUIP NATIONAL JUDGES WITH THE TOOLS TO RESIST DOMESTIC JUDICIAL REFORMS THAT AFFECT THEIR FREEDOM TO ADJUDICATE INDEPENDENTLY. CONSIDERING SIMMENTHAL TO UNIBET, ASSOCIACAO SINDICAL DOS JUIZES PORTUGUESES TO THE LATEST CASE-LAW RELATING TO THE ORGANISATION OF NATIONAL JUDICIARIES, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT, WHILE THE CASE-LAW ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS UNPRECEDENTED, THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ENSURE THAT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN EU LAW PRECIPITATED BY ITS RULINGS ARE GROUNDED IN ESTABLISHED DOCTRINE. THEY FOLLOW A LINE OF CASE-LAW THAT BUILDS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIMACY OF EU LAW AND THE OBLIGATION TO GUARANTEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU LAW IN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER. FURTHER, THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY IS FOR ARTICLE 19 TEU TO FORM THE OPERATIONAL BASIS OF REVIEW OF ANY JUDICIALLY MINDED REFORMS, WHETHER THEY BE ORGANISATIONAL (ARTICLE 19 TEU, TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 47 CFREU), LIMIT ACTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY THE FREEDOM FOR DIALOGUE BETWEEN NATIONAL COURTS AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE (ARTICLE 19 TEU TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 267 TFEU AND ARTICLE 47 CFREU) OR WHERE THEY REDUCE THE PROTECTION OF THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW (ARTICLE 19 TEU, ARTICLE 2 TEU, ARTICLE 49 TEU AND ARTICLE 47 CFREU), WITH POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION IN EU LAW OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL TRUST.
731	THIS HISTORICAL PAPER ENGAGES IN A FORM OF DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTS ON THREE MURDER TRIALS IN BOTSWANA WHICH INVOLVED A WHITE PERSON(S) AS A VICTIM OR PERPETRATOR. FIRST, IS THE TRIAL OF BOTSWANA DEFENCE FORCE SOLDIER, SERGEANT OMPATILE TSWAIPE, AFTER ALLEGEDLY ORDERING HIS PLATOON TO SHOOT THREE SUSPECTED WHITE INSURGENTS IN THE TULI BLOCK IN 1978. OUTRAGE AND PRESSURE FROM APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICAN AND BRITISH MEDIA AND OFFICIALDOM SEEMS TO HAVE LED TO THE PROSECUTION OF TSWAIPE WHILE PUBLIC OPINION IN BOTSWANA SOLIDLY STOOD BEHIND HIM AS A PATRIOT. THE SECOND TRIAL INVOLVED CLEMENT GOFHAMODIMO IN 1984 WHO HAD MURDERED AND ROBBED A WHITE SWISS TOURIST, AND FLED TO THE UNITED STATES IN 1978. THE HIERARCHY AT HIS ALMA MATER, UNIVERSITY OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MOBILIZED LEADING AFRICAN-AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS AND TRIED TO PLEAD WITH PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN AND POPE JOHN PAUL II TO ENTREAT PRESIDENT QUETT MASIRE OF BOTSWANA FOR CLEMENCY. FINALLY, IS THE TRIAL OF MARIETTE BOSCH, A SOUTH AFRICAN WHITE WOMAN WHO MURDERED HER SOUTH AFRICAN LADY FRIEND IN 1996 TO MARRY HER HUSBAND. WHILE BOSCH WAS ON DEATH ROW IN 2001, THERE WAS A SPIRITED CAMPAIGN IN SOME WESTERN AND SOUTH AFRICAN QUARTERS FOR HER CLEMENCY BY PRESIDENT FESTUS MOGAE OF BOTSWANA WHILE BLACKS ON DEATH ROW WITH HER WERE IGNORED. THE PAPER OBSERVES THAT THE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTS PUT BOTSWANA'S INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE SPOTLIGHT WHICH WAS CHALLENGED BY THE LOCAL PUBLIC OPINION.
732	THERE IS A WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THAT ARMED FORCES ARE NOT SUITED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TASKS. MOST ARGUMENTS AGAINST USING TROOPS IN PUBLIC SECURITY ARE BASED ON THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND THE MILITARY'S DIFFICULTY IN PRACTISING RESTRAINT WHEN USING FORCE. BRAZIL HAS NONETHELESS MILITARISED ITS PUBLIC SECURITY PROVISION BY INCREASINGLY DEPLOYING SOLDIERS IN 'GUARANTEEING LAW AND ORDER' (GLO) OPERATIONS - AT TIMES EVEN JUSTIFYING THESE MISSIONS WITH THE MILITARY'S EXPERIENCE IN UN PEACEKEEPING. DRAWING ON SURVEY RESEARCH, INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH TROOPS AS WELL AS THE OBSERVATION OF TRAINING EXERCISES, THIS ARTICLE ASKS: HOW HAS THE PARTICIPATION IN THESE MISSIONS AFFECTED TROOPS' PERCEIVED SKILLS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT? WHAT KIND OF LESSONS ARE THEY TRANSFERRING FROM UN PEACEKEEPING TO INTERNAL MISSIONS AND VICE-VERSA? WHAT ARE THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON HAVING TO APPLY COERCION GRADUALLY? IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT SOLDIERS PERCEIVE TO HAVE GAINED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SKILLS DURING UN PEACEKEEPING AND GLO OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CLEAR LIMITATIONS IN CRITICAL SITUATIONS. SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS FELT RESTRICTED BY RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND CONSIDERED THE GREATER USE OF FORCE ALLOWED IN UN PEACEKEEPING AS NECESSARY FOR THE MISSION'S EFFECTIVENESS. NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ACT IN A SIMILAR MANNER IN GLO OPERATIONS HAS LED TO HIGH LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION AMONG SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS. IN THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE ACTIONS AGAINST CRIMINALS, TROOPS TEND TO PREFER THE LATTER. THIS UNDERLINES THE RISK OF DEPLOYING SOLDIERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ROLES.
733	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF IMPROVING THE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE TAXATION SYSTEM IN UKRAINE IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION CONTEXT. DETERMINATION OF THE DOCTRINAL BASIS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAX FUNCTION OF THE STATE AND ITS LEGAL CONSOLIDATION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW ALLOWS CARRYING OUT A COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS OF TAXATION IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE WORLD (PARTICULARLY INDIRECT ONE). METHODOLOGY. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE THEORETICAL AND LEGAL SUBSTANTIATION OF THE SOCIAL CONTENT OF TAX ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE, AND IT IS ALSO BASED ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIALECTICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TAX PROCESSES AND THE FUNCTIONING OF SOCIAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS IN GENERAL. A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE TAX ACTIVITY OF THE STATE IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMANISM, JUSTICE, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, RULE OF LAW IS CARRIED OUT. ON THIS BASIS, THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE REGULATION OF THE VALUE-ADDED TAX IS REVEALED. RESULTS. THE BASIC THEORETICAL AND LEGAL BASES OF MEASURES ON IMPROVEMENT OF THE TAXATION SYSTEM ARE DETERMINED AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY FROM THE POSITION OF ITS LEGITIMATION AMONG CITIZENS AND STIMULATION OF THEIR PURCHASING POWER AND DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTIVE FORCES OF THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMY. PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE DEFINITION OF DIRECTIONS FOR PERFECTION AND HUMANIZATION OF TAX LEGISLATION IN UKRAINE ALLOWS MAKING A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE VOLUME OF THE TAX BURDEN ON THE CONSUMER AND PROPOSING OPTIMAL RATES OF VALUE-ADDED TAX RATES.
734	THE TRANSNATIONAL NATURE OF TERRORIST AND COUNTER-TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, AND THE INTERSTATE COOPERATION THAT FORMS THE BASIS OF MANY COUNTER-TERRORISM OPERATIONS, ENGAGES DIFFICULT AND CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. THE DECISIONS IN JULY 2011 OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AL-SKEINI AND OTHERS V THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AL-JEDDA V THE UNITED KINGDOM CONCERN THE JURISDICTIONAL REACH OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO OPERATIONS ABROAD, INCLUDING IN THE CONTEXT OF MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS CONDUCTED UNDER A UNITED NATIONS (UN) MANDATE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE DECISIONS USHER IN A NEW ERA IN HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY BY REALIGNING THE RULES CONCERNING ATTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE UN AND MULTINATIONAL FORCES; AND BY MOVING TO A HYBRID TEST BETWEEN PERSONAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL JURISDICTION IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE FINDING OF A JURISDICTIONAL LINK FOR THE KILLING OF PERSONS WHERE THE STATE HAS ASSUMED PUBLIC FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF SECURITY. WHILE IT IS INEVITABLE THAT SOME QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED, THE DECISIONS GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS REPAIRING THE EARLIER RESTRICTIVE AND HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT IN BANKOVIC ' AND OTHERS V BELGIUM AND BEHRAMI AND SARAMATI V FRANCE. THE COURT'S DECISION IN AL-JEDDA ALSO ESTABLISHES A ROBUST APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE POSITION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY THAT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.
735	JUDICIAL LANGUAGE IS THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL LEGAL LANGUAGES. IN FACT, JUDGES DO THINGS WITH WORDS, OR MORE PRECISELY, JUDGES DO THINGS WITH CASES. THIS PAPER CONDUCTS A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CONTEMPORARY JUDICIAL ENGLISH, FRENCH AND SPANISH. TO THAT END, IT COMBINES LEXICOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS. THE FIRST PART CONTAINS A LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS AND OFFERS A SHORT INSTITUTIONAL PRESENTATION OF NINE SUPREME COURTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, SPAIN AND EUROPE THAT WORK IN THESE LANGUAGES. THE LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS INCLUDES A COMPARISON OF TERMS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT (COURT/COUR/CORTE; RULE OF LAW/L. EMPIRE DE LA LOI/ESTADO DE DERECHO; AND PRIVACY/VIE PRIVEE/INTIMIDAD). INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS ARE BASED ON THREE IDEAS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW JUDICIAL LANGUAGE IS DEPENDENT ON THE WAY JUDGES ARE SELECTED, THE STYLE OF ARGUMENTATION USED BY THE COURTS AND THE RULINGS THEMSELVES. THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF RENDERING A DECISION ARE WHAT DETERMINE THE DISTINCTIVE TRAITS OF EACH COURT. THAT IS WHY DELIBERATING IN SECRET OR DELIBERATING IN PUBLIC, ISSUING A SINGLE RULING ON BEHALF OF THE COURT, OR HAVING EACH JUSTICE EXPRESS HIS OWN POSITION (ONE OPINION FOR EACH JUSTICE, OR ONLY THE DISSENTING OR CONCURRING OPINIONS) ARE ALL QUITE DIFFERENT OPTIONS. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER ENGAGES IN AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF NINE DECISIONS RENDERED BY THE COURTS UNDER STUDY. NINE TABLES ARE DISPLAYED WITH THOSE TERMS THAT COULD PROVE THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF EACH COURT ' S DECISIONS, IN EACH OF THE LANGUAGES USED AND WITHIN A SPECIFIC POLITICAL, LEGAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT.
736	THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS AIMS TO CORRECT THE APPLICATION OF A RULE OF LAW ON THE BASIS OF STANDARDS SUCH AS GOOD FAITH, FAIRNESS, AND JUSTICE IF, DESPITE FORMAL OBSERVANCE OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE RULE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THAT RULE HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THIS PRINCIPLE AMOUNTS TO A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF UNION LAW. FIRST, A COMMON CONCEPT OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS EXISTS IN THE LEGAL TRADITIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES. SECOND, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) HAS GRADUALLY BUILT A UNION CONCEPT OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS (EMSLAND-STARKE, HALIFAX, KOFOED). HOWEVER, THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS IS NOT EXPRESSLY INCORPORATED INTO THE CODIFICATION PROJECTS ON EUROPEAN CONTRACT LAW. THIS PRINCIPLE CONSTITUTES A SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF THE GENERAL DUTY OF GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING IN ITS LIMITATIVE FUNCTION. IN PRINCIPLE, THIS APPROACH IS VALID, MORE SPECIFICALLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CIVIL LAW TRADITIONS WHERE THE PROHIBITION OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS IS LIKEWISE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE APPLICATIONS OF THE MORE GENERAL AND AUTONOMOUS LIMITATIVE FUNCTION OF GOOD FAITH (E.G., GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS). HOWEVER, AN EXPRESS INCORPORATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF ABUSE OF RIGHTS WOULD BE ADVISABLE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CIVIL LAW TRADITIONS WHERE THE LIMITATIVE FUNCTION OF GOOD FAITH IS NOT AUTONOMOUS BUT EXCLUSIVELY LINKED TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE PROHIBITING THE ABUSE OF RIGHTS (E.G., BELGIUM AND FRANCE). SUCH AN INCORPORATION WOULD BE IN LINE WITH THE RECOGNITION OF A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF UNION LAW PROHIBITING THE ABUSE OF RIGHTS.
737	NEW LIBERAL SPACES IN SEVERAL SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE CREATED A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR NON-STATE ACTORS TO LOBBY FOR THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN ASEAN. DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS CANNOT IGNORE THE VOICES OF THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND CONSEQUENTLY PROMOTE LIBERAL VALUES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. THIS IS MAINLY THE CASE FOR INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES, AND THE OTHER MEMBER STATES FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THEIR EYES TO LIBERAL AGENDAS. BOTH JAKARTA AND MANILA FOLLOW A FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGY OF REFORMING ASEAN INTO AN ORGANIZATION THAT ACTIVELY SUBSCRIBES TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES, AS THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING THE ASEAN CHARTER DEMONSTRATED. THE CHARTER GIVES EVIDENCE OF THE GROUP'S CAUTIOUS LIBERAL TURN AS IT EXPLICITLY IDENTIFIES THE RULE OF LAW, GOOD GOVERNANCE, DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AS ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF POLITICAL ORDER. HOWEVER, IT IS A LONG WAY FROM THE CAUTIOUS ACCEPTANCE OF GENERAL DEMOCRATIC VALUES TO THE ACTIVE PROMOTION AND REGIONAL ENFORCEMENTS OF RULES BASED ON THESE NORMS. IN VIEW OF THE DIVERSITY OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN ASEAN, IT COMES AS NO SURPRISE THAT THE ASSOCIATION AS A COLLECTIVE ACTOR IS UNABLE TO AGREE ON ANY MEANINGFUL STRATEGY AS TO HOW TO SUPPORT AND RESPOND TO POLITICAL CHANGE. ASEAN'S FAILURE TO USE DIPLOMATIC LEVERAGE TO PRESSURE ITS MEMBER BURMA FOR POLITICAL REFORMS IS A CASE IN POINT. AT THE SAME TIME ASEAN DOES NOT IMPEDE DEMOCRACY, AND FUTURE ANALYSTS MIGHT BE LOOKING BACK ON THE COMMITMENT TO CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN THE ASEAN CHARTER AS THE PRE-STAGE OF REGIONAL-DEMOCRACY PROMOTION.
738	THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY (ENP) OBJECTIVE IS TO SHARE THE BENEFITS OF THE EU'S 2004 ENLARGEMENT WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES IN STRENGTHENING STABILITY, SECURITY AND WELL-BEING FOR ALL CONCERNED. IT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF NEW DIVIDING LINES BETWEEN THE ENLARGED EU AND ITS NEIGHBOURS AND TO OFFER THEM THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS EU ACTIVITIES, THROUGH GREATER POLITICAL, SECURITY, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CO-OPERATION. ENP WILL ALSO HELP ADDRESS ONE OF THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES THE EUROPEAN UNION SET IN THE EUROPEAN SECURITY STRATEGY IN DECEMBER 2003, THAT OF BUILDING SECURITY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. THE ENP IS DISTINCT FROM THE ISSUE OF POTENTIAL MEMBERSHIP. IT OFFERS A PRIVILEGED RELATIONSHIP WITH NEIGHBOURS, WHICH WILL BUILD ON MUTUAL COMMITMENT TO COMMON VALUES PRINCIPALLY WITHIN THE FIELDS OF THE RULE OF LAW, GOOD GOVERNANCE, THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING MINORITY RIGHTS, THE PROMOTION OF GOOD NEIGHBOURLY RELATIONS, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF MARKET ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE LEVEL OF AMBITION OF THE EU'S RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS NEIGHBOURS WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE VALUES ARE EFFECTIVELY SHARED. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE MAIN CHARACTERS AND THE CONTENT OF THIS NEW STRATEGIC OPTION WHICH IMPLIES THE ENP. ON THIS BASIS OF ITS ORIGINS AND THE GROUNDS WHICH DRAW THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO PROPOSE THE CREATION OF THIS NEW POLICY, THIS PAPER FOCUSSES ITS ATTENTION ON THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WHICH SHAPE THE ENP AND THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT REAL.
739	WE STUDY THE EFFECT OF A SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATING CHANGE OF ONE COUNTRY ON THE SOVEREIGN CREDIT SPREADS OF OTHER COUNTRIES FROM 1991 TO 2000. WE FIND EVIDENCE OF SPILLOVER EFFECTS; THAT IS, A RATINGS CHANGE IN ONE COUNTRY HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SOVEREIGN CREDIT SPREADS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS EFFECT IS ASYMMETRIC: POSITIVE RATINGS EVENTS ABROAD HAVE NO DISCERNABLE IMPACT ON SOVEREIGN SPREADS, WHEREAS NEGATIVE RATINGS EVENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN SPREADS. ON AVERAGE, A ONE-NOTCH DOWNGRADE OF A SOVEREIGN BOND IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 12 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN SPREADS OF SOVEREIGN BONDS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SPILLOVER EFFECT FOLLOWING A NEGATIVE RATINGS CHANGE IS AMPLIFIED BY RECENT RATINGS CHANGES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COMMON INFORMATION AND DIFFERENTIAL COMPONENTS OF SPILLOVERS. WHILE COMMON INFORMATION SPILLOVERS IMPLY THAT SOVEREIGN SPREADS MOVE IN TANDEM, DIFFERENTIAL SPILLOVERS ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN OPPOSITE EFFECTS OF RATINGS EVENTS ACROSS COUNTRIES. DESPITE THE PREDOMINANCE OF COMMON INFORMATION SPILLOVERS, WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL SPILLOVERS AMONG COUNTRIES WITH HIGHLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED CAPITAL FLOWS OR TRADE FLOWS VIS-A-VIS THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS, SPREADS IN THESE COUNTRIES GENERALLY FALL IN RESPONSE TO A DOWNGRADE OF A COUNTRY WITH HIGHLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED CAPITAL OR TRADE FLOWS. VARIABLES PROXYING FOR CULTURAL OR INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGES (E.G., COMMON LANGUAGE, FORMAL TRADE BLOCS, COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS), PHYSICAL PROXIMITY, AND RULE OF LAW TRADITIONS ACROSS COUNTRIES DO NOT SEEM TO AFFECT ESTIMATED SPILLOVER EFFECTS.

740	CYBER OPERATIONS POSE A SET OF NOVEL CHALLENGES TO THE GENERALLY CONSERVATIVE BODY OF THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY. CENTRAL AMONG THEM IS THE PROBLEM OF ATTRIBUTION, WHICH LIES AT THE INTERSECTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND LAW. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATES' TECHNOLOGICAL CAPACITY TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF CYBERATTACKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT REVISITS ARTICLE 8 OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION'S ARTICLES ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO 'DECODE' ITS CONTENTS VIS-A-VIS ITS DRAFTING HISTORY AND WITH AN EYE ON ITS FUTURE APPLICATION TO THE CONDUCT IN CYBERSPACE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE ARE THREE AUTONOMOUS STANDARDS OF ATTRIBUTION BUILT INTO THAT PROVISION: INSTRUCTIONS, DIRECTION AND CONTROL. IT THEN DEMONSTRATES THE UTILITY AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH OF THEM AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF ACTUAL AND HYPOTHETICAL CYBER OPERATIONS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW IN THIS AREA, FOCUSSING ON THE MISSING POTENTIAL OF THE LAW TO REGULATE THE INSTIGATION OF WRONGFUL CYBER CONDUCT AND ON THE PROHIBITIVELY STRICT TEST OF CONTROL APPLICABLE DE LEGE LATA.
741	THOUGH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF URBAN PLANNING PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE NATURE OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS LIMITED SCHOLARSHIP ON THE PLANNING LAW REGIMES OF DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN ASIA AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH. FOR COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS SEEN TO BE WEAK AND IMPLEMENTED ARBITRARILY, MUCH OF ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP HAS FOCUSED ON INFORMALITY IN URBAN PLANNING, AND THE FORMAL PLANNING PROCESS HAS BEEN RELATIVELY IGNORED. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ELUCIDATE THE PLANNING LAW REGIME THAT OPERATES IN INDIA THROUGH A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF URBAN PLANNING IN THE CITY OF BANGALORE. IT TRACES THE COLONIAL ROOTS OF INDIA'S URBAN PLANNING SYSTEM, EXAMINES THE INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES OF PLANNING THAT OPERATE IN BANGALORE, HIGHLIGHTS THE DEBATES AROUND THE CONTENTS OF THE MASTER PLAN, AND EXAMINES THE DIFFICULTY OF ENFORCING THE PLAN. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN WITH INDIA'S URBAN PLANNING REGIME IS THE DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY TO PLAN AND LOCAL DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. EVEN AFTER THE PASSING OF THE 74TH CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN 1992, WHICH SOUGHT TO EMPOWER MUNICIPALITIES BY VESTING THEM WITH MULTIPLE POWERS INCLUDING THAT OF URBAN PLANNING, THE MASTER PLAN FOR BANGALORE IS STILL NOT PREPARED BY THE ELECTED MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT BUT BY AN UNELECTED PARASTATAL AGENCY CONTROLLED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THE ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE CONCERNS REGARDING THE TOP-DOWN PLANNING PROCESS WHICH DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE AVENUES FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, THE STATIC LAND-USE BASED MASTER PLANS THAT DO NOT INTEGRATE KEY SECTORS OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH OF ADDRESSING NON-ENFORCEMENT OF PLANS BY LEGALIZING VIOLATIONS OF PLANNING NORMS.
742	JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY HAS LONG BEEN APPLIED IN CASES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES IN BRAZIL. FROM A GENERIC MATRIX, IT IS ONLY SAID THAT THE INSTITUTE SHOULD BE APPLIED TO CASES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE FROM MULTI-CAUSAL CAUSES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A VISIBLE LACK OF LEGAL REFLECTION ON THE CRITERIA JUSTIFYING ITS INCIDENCE AND, ABOVE ALL, DEFINING THE LIMITS OF THIS INSTITUTE. SOMETIMES AN UNRESTRICTED EXPANSION, UNRELATED TO THE TECHNICAL AND FACTUAL COMPLEXITIES OF A GIVEN ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, CAN RESULT IN ASYMMETRIES, INEQUALITIES AND OVERDETERRENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, A CLEAR DEFINITION AND THE REASONING FOR APPLYING JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INSTITUTE'S BOUNDARIES TEND TO STRENGTHEN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ON THE ONE HAND AND THE DESIRABLE STABILITY OF SOCIOECONOMIC RELATIONS ON THE OTHER. ON THE CONTRARY, UNRESTRICTED APPLICATION MAY, ON THE CONTRARY, IMPLY REAL INJUSTICES AND IMBALANCES IN SPECIFIC CASES. THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON A STILL STORMY THEME IN THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, THAT IS, THE CRITERIA DEFINING THE LIMITS OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE DEFINITION OF THE SO-CALLED INDIRECT POLLUTER, AS A THIRD PARTY. TO THIS END, THE ARTICLE METHODOLOGICALLY USES SYSTEMIC REFLECTIONS, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE RESEARCH HAS A STRONG EMPHASIS ON COMPARATIVE LAW FROM EXPERIENCES ADOPTED IN INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALREADY FACED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THE CRITERIA FOR THE DEFINITION OF THESE INSTITUTES AS WELL AS FOR THEIR APPLICATION BECOME OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF AN EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ITS EXERCISE IN BALANCE WITH THE ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY.
743	AN ENQUIRY-BASED AND PARTICIPATORY ANALYSIS APPROACH IS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE HETEROGENEOUS LEGISLATIONS ACROSS EUROPE THAT REGULATE THE INTEGRATION OF LANDSLIDE HAZARD INTO URBAN PLANNING. TWENTY ONE NATIONAL AND EIGHT REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS (GSS) HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE GSS REPORT ALMOST 4000 RECENT (2015-2017) DAMAGING LANDSLIDES EVENTS RESULTING IN 39 FATALITIES AND 155 INJURIES, DESTRUCTION TO HOUSING, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, 11 COUNTRIES REPORT 18 MORLE EVENTS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS RESPONSIBLE FOR 150 FATALITIES AND SEVERE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. RESULTS ALSO REVEAL ALMOST 48 MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN AREAS WITH HIGH AND VERY HIGH DEGREES OF LANDSLIDE-SUSCEPTIBILITY (AROUND 1 MILLION KM(2) ACCORDING TO ELSUS V2). THIS WORK SHOWS THAT ALMOST HALF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES (10 COUNTRIES) HAVE NO LEGAL GUIDANCE IN THE NATIONAL LAND BILL TO STIPULATE CONSIDERATION OF LANDSLIDES IN URBAN PLANNING PRACTICES, AND MAPPING TOOLS ARE OFTEN NOT ADAPTED TO A STANDARD REQUIRED TO INFORM SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF LAWS AND A LARGE HETEROGENEITY OF MAPPING METHODS, SCALES AND PROCEDURES. A RELEVANT DEFICIENCY DETECTED IN MANY COUNTRIES IS THE LACK OF LANDSLIDE MAPS AT A DETAILED RESOLUTION FOR URBAN PLANNING. ADDITIONALLY, SOME CASE STUDIES OF SUBOPTIMAL URBAN DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES IN AREAS OF KNOWN INSTABILITY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED; THEY ARE FOUND TO BE RELATED TO WEAK RULE OF LAW AND/OR ABSENCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS PAPER SHOWS INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS EUROPE IN THE HANDLING OF LANDSLIDES AND PROPOSES A SERIES OF KEY ACTIONS TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR A COMMON REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO DEAL WITH THIS GEOHAZARD APPROPRIATELY.
744	THIS SYMPOSIUM SUMMARIZES THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE ON MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC GOODS AT THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE, FLORENCE, IN SPRING 2011 AND REPRODUCES 4 OF THE ALTOGETHER 15 CONFERENCE PAPERS. 1 THIS 'INTRODUCTION' IDENTIFIES AREAS WHERE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS THEORIES NEED FURTHER RESEARCH. THE 'KEYNOTE SPEECH' BY WTO DIRECTOR-GENERAL PASCAL LAMY GIVES A UNIQUE POLICY PERSPECTIVE ON 'GLOBAL GOVERNANCE: FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE'. INGE KAUL'S PAPER ON 'GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS THEORY: EXPLAINING THE UNDERPROVISION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS AND CORRECTIVE STRATEGIES' OFFERS A SUMMARY-BY ONE OF THE LEADING RESEARCHERS ON PUBLIC GOODS THEORY-OF THE MAIN 'COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS' IMPEDING MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC GOODS. 'THE G-20 AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE: LESSONS FROM MULTILEVEL EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE?', BY JAN WOUTERS AND THOMAS RAMOPOULOS, DISCUSSES THE POLICY QUESTION OF WHETHER REFORMS OF THE G-20 MEETINGS CAN AND SHOULD BE INSPIRED BY EUROPEAN EXPERIENCES OF MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE. DANIEL ESTY AND ANTHONY MOFFA EXPLORE 'WHY CLIMATE CHANGE COLLECTIVE ACTION HAS FAILED AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE TRADE REGIME'. ONE MAJOR CONCLUSION OF THE SYMPOSIUM IS THAT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 'PUBLIC GOODS THEORIES' NEGLECT LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM AS INSTRUMENTS FOR PRODUCING 'AGGREGATE PUBLIC GOODS'. REMEDYING THIS NEGLECT REQUIRES INTEGRATING LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL THEORIES INTO PUBLIC GOODS RESEARCH. RECONCILING, ON THE ONE HAND, THE POWER-ORIENTED 'ETHOS OF DIPLOMATS' FOCUS ON PROMOTION OF 'NATIONAL INTERESTS' THROUGH 'RULE BY LAW' WITH, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE JUSTICE-ORIENTED 'ETHOS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES' FOCUS ON COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL AND DEMOCRATIC SELF-DEVELOPMENT THROUGH 'RULE OF LAW' REMAINS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN PROTECTING INTERNATIONAL 'AGGREGATE PUBLIC GOODS' IN THE 21ST CENTURY.
745	ETHIOPIA, A FOUNDING MEMBER OF MANY OF THE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TODAY AND THE SECOND MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY IN THE UN LIST OF LEAST-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS), IS CURRENTLY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF NEGOTIATING ITS ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO). THIS ARTICLE ASKS THE BASIC QUESTIONS OF WHY ETHIOPIA UNCHARACTERISTICALLY STAYED OUT OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT MULTILATERAL ENDEAVOUR FOR SO LONG AND WHY IT WANTS TO JOIN NOW, AND WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISION TO JOIN THE SYSTEM WILL BE FOR THE LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY LANDSCAPE OF THE COUNTRY BOTH DURING THE ACCESSION PROCESS AS WELL AS AFTER ACHIEVING MEMBERSHIP. THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT ARGUES THAT WTO ACCESSION WOULD HELP FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH, ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT, SECURE PREDICTABLE AND TRANSPARENT MARKET ACCESS, AND ALLOW IT TO HAVE A SAY ON THE DIRECTION OF GLOBALIZATION. WHILE MANY OF THESE ARE IN LINE WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF WTO ACCESSION, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE BALANCE OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE WTO LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ITS ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM MEAN THAT ETHIOPIA'S ABILITY TO MAKE USE OF THE SYSTEM TO REALIZE THESE AMBITIONS IS, AT BEST, LIMITED. HOWEVER, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A POSITIVE NOTE THAT, IF THE ACCESSION PROCESS IS HANDLED CAREFULLY AND FINAL MEMBERSHIP OBLIGATIONS CARRIED OUT IN GOOD FILTH, WTO ACCESSION IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE GOALS INDIRECTLY THROUGH, INTER ALIA, THE REVIEW AND REFORM OF NATIONAL LAWS AND POLICIES, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OBJECTIVE, IMPARTIAL AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND IMPLEMENTING INSTITUTIONS, AND ITS POTENTIAL OVERALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM OF RULE OF LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE COUNTRY.
746	WHAT STATUTORY LANGUAGE MEANS CAN VARY FROM STATUTE TO STATUTE, OR EVEN PROVISION TO PROVISION. BUT WHAT ABOUT FROM CASE TO CASE? THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS THAT THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS AS USED IN DIFFERENT PLACES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES CODE. AS USED IN SOME SPECIFIC PLACE, HOWEVER, THAT LANGUAGE MEANS WHAT IT MEANS. PUT DIFFERENTLY, THE SAME STATUTORY PROVISION MUST MEAN THE SAME THING IN ALL CASES. TO HOLD OTHERWISE, COURTS AND SCHOLARS SUGGEST, WOULD BE CONTRARY BOTH TO THE RULES OF GRAMMAR AND TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. BUILDING ON THE OBSERVATION THAT SPEAKERS CAN AND OFTEN DO TRANSPARENTLY COMMUNICATE DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES WITH THE SAME VERBALIZATION OR WRITTEN TEXT, IT ARGUES THAT, AS A PURELY LINGUISTIC MATTER, THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT CONGRESS FROM DOING THE SAME WITH STATUTES. MORE STILL, BECAUSE THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF USING MULTIPLE MEANINGS-IN PARTICULAR, LINGUISTIC ECONOMY-ARE AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT TO CONGRESS AS TO ORDINARY SPEAKERS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FURTHER THAT IT WOULD BE JUST PLAIN ODD IF CONGRESS NEVER CHOSE TO COMMUNICATE MULTIPLE MESSAGES WITH THE SAME STATUTORY TEXT. AS THIS ARTICLE GOES ON TO SHOW, RECOGNIZING THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE STATUTORY MEANINGS WOULD LET COURTS REACH SENSIBLE ANSWERS TO IMPORTANT DOCTRINAL QUESTIONS THEY CURRENTLY DO THEIR BEST TO AVOID. MOST NOTABLY, THINKING ABOUT MULTIPLE MEANINGS IN AN INFORMED WAY WOULD HELP COURTS EXPLAIN UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS MORE THAN ONE AGENCY SHOULD RECEIVE DEFERENCE WHEN INTERPRETING A MULTI-AGENCY STATUTE. RELATEDLY, IT WOULD LET COURTS REJECT AS FALSE THE CHOICE BETWEEN CHEVRON DEFERENCE AND THE RULE OF LENITY FOR STATUTES WITH BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL APPLICATIONS.
747	WITHIN JUST OVER ONE MONTH OF COMING INTO OPERATION IN MAY 2014, THE NEW BAIL ACT 2013 (NSW), A PRODUCT OF LONG-TERM LAW REFORM CONSIDERATION, WAS REVIEWED AND THEN AMENDED AFTER TALK-BACK RADIO 'SHOCK JOCK' AND TABLOID NEWSPAPER OUTCRY OVER THREE CASES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MEDIA TRIGGERS, THE MAIN ARGUMENTS OF THE REVIEW CONDUCTED BY FORMER NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW) ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN HATZISTERGOS, AND THE AMENDMENTS, WITH OUR ANALYSIS OF THE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ACT THUS FAR PROVIDING RELEVANT BACKGROUND. WE ARGUE THAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE PREMATURE, UNNECESSARY, CREATE COMPLEXITY AND CONFUSION, AND, QUITE POSSIBLY, WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: IN SHORT, THEY ARE A MESS. THE WHOLE PROCESS OF REVERSAL IS AN EXAMPLE OF LAW AND ORDER POLITICS DRIVEN BY THE SHOCK JOCKS AND TABLOID MEDIA, THE VIEWS OF WHICH, ARE BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE PURPOSE OF BAIL AND ITS PLACE IN THE CRIMINAL PROCESS, RESULTING IN A CONFLATION OF ACCUSATION, GUILT AND PUNISHMENT. OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVIEW AND AMENDMENTS PROCESS RECOGNISED IN THIS ARTICLE INCLUDE THE DENIGRATION OF JUDICIAL EXPERTISE AND LACK OF CONCERN WITH EVIDENCE AND PROCESS; THE DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE OF THE SHOCK JOCKS, TABLOIDS AND POLICE ASSOCIATION OF NSW ON POLICY FORMATION; THE PRACTICE OF USING RETIRED POLITICIANS TO PRODUCE 'QUICK FIX' REVIEWS; AND THE POLITICAL FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND AND DEFEND FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES THAT BENEFIT US ALL AND ARE CENTRAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME DISCUSSION OF WAYS IN WHICH MEDIA AND POLITICAL DEBATE MIGHT BE CONDUCTED TO PRODUCE MORE BALANCED OUTCOMES.
748	IN COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM VIOLENT CONFLICT AND/OR MASS ATROCITY, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PROMOTE STABILITY AND OFTEN ALSOWIDESPREAD DEMAND FOR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ABUSES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE. DEBATE HAS RAGED AMONG SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS ABOUT WHETHER JUSTICE SHOULD BE SACRIFICED OR DELAYED FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE, OR SHOULD BE PROMOTED EVEN IF IT IS IN THE SHORT TERM DESTABILISING. IN MANY COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM CONFLICT PROCESSES OF ACCOUNTABILITY, OR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES, OPERATE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY ALONGSIDE PROCESSES OF PEACE-BUILDING SUCH AS DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILISATION AND REINTEGRATION OF EX-COMBATANTS, REFORM OF THE SECURITY SECTOR AND RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF CONFLICT. THESE CAN INCLUDE DOMESTIC PROCESSES OF TRUTH-TELLING, PROSECUTION, REPARATION AND AMNESTY, OR INTERNATIONALLY PROMOTED PROCESSES SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE INTERNATIONALISED CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS, WHICH HAVE MIXED NATIONAL-INTERNATIONAL STAFF. WHILE SCHOLARSHIP HAS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND PEACE-BUILDING PROCESSES IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR TERM, FAR LESS HAS EXAMINED THE ROLE OF PROCESSES OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT FOLLOW CONFLICT TERMINATION BY A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME, JUSTICE DELAYED. DRAWING ON RECENT FIELDWORK, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THREE INTERNATIONALISED CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS DEVELOPED SOME 15 YEARS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF CONFLICT IN COUNTRIES THAT EXPERIENCED THREE VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONFLICT, CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACE-BUILDING OR RECONSTRUCTION IN BOSNIA, LEBANON AND CAMBODIA. THEY FIND THAT DESPITE CLAIMS MADE BY ADVOCATES FOR SUCH INSTITUTIONS, SUCH TRIBUNALS MAY ONLY HAVE LIMITED IMPACT ON LONGER TERMPEACE-BUILDING AND THAT THE EFFECTS OF FLAWED PEACE-BUILDING ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF THE TRIBUNALS.
749	JAPAN AND THE EU FORMALLY AGREED ON THE OUTLINE OF THE JAPAN-EU STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (SPA) AND THE ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (EPA) ON 7 JULY 2017 AND FINALIZED ON 17 JULY 2018. DESPITE SUCH MAJOR SHIFTS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND EUROPE, IT IS UNFORTUNATELY TRUE THAT JAPANESE SOCIETY DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING A COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP OR NEGOTIATING AGREEMENTS SUCH AS THE SPA WITH THE EU, IN FIELDS OTHER THAN ECONOMICS. HOWEVER, THIS LOW LEVEL OF INTEREST DOES NOT MEAN THAT STRENGTHENING A POLITICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU IS UNIMPORTANT. RATHER, CONFIRMING THAT JAPAN AND THE EU SHARE THE BASIC VALUES PROMOTED BY THE SPA IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN IT WAS IN 2011, WHEN BOTH LEADERS DECIDED TO INITIATE SPA AND EPA NEGOTIATIONS. THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER-BASED ON VALUES SUCH AS LIBERTY, DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE MARKET ECONOMY, AND FREE TRADE-WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT UP BY WESTERN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING JAPAN, SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, IS BEING CHALLENGED NOT ONLY BY EMERGING COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA BUT ALSO BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES. JAPAN-EUROPE RELATIONS AFTER WORLD WAR II HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DOMINATED BY ECONOMIC FRICTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE 1960S-1980S. BUT THE EXPERIENCES INVOLVED IN RESOLVING THE ECONOMIC FRICTION ENABLED THE RELATIONS TO EVOLVE FROM ECONOMIC INTERESTS TO THE OTHER AREA. THERE WAS A QUALITATIVE TRANSFORMATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JAPAN AND EUROPE IN THE 1990S. THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION WITH THE EU FOR JAPAN IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.
750	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE FORMATION OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE WHITE GOVERNMENTS OF THE SOUTHERN RUSSIA AND SIBERIA IN 1918-1920. THE RESTORATION OF THE JUDICIARY, THE DETERMINATION OF ITS STATUS IN THE CHANGED CONDITIONS OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION AND THE CIVIL WAR BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT DIRECTION OF THE POLICY OF THE RUSSIAN WHITE MOVEMENT. WHITE GOVERNMENTS PROCLAIMED THE RESTORATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE JUDICIAL REFORM OF 1864. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE JUDICIARY AT VARIOUS LEVELS: FROM GOVERNMENT SENATE TO THE LOCAL JUDICIARY. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE PROBLEMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE CONDITIONS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS AS WELL AS REGIONAL LEGAL SPECIFICITY. THE RESTORATION AND FORMATION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE WHITE POWER. HOWEVER, IN THE CONDITIONS OF WAR AND WITH AN ACUTE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, THE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS RESTORED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND IN THE MOST SIMPLIFIED FORMS. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN BOTH THE WHITE SOUTH AND SIBERIA WAS THE LACK OF CLEAR DELINEATION OF THE COMPETENCE OF MILITARY AND CIVIL JUSTICE, AS WELL AS THE UNACCEPTABLE ADHERENCE TO THE NORMS OF THE "EMERGENCY SITUATION" IN PEACETIME. THIS WAS REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT IN THE SENATE CONCLUSIONS PUBLISHED IN NOVOCHERKASSK AND OMSK, THIS WAS MENTIONED IN SPEECHES, MEMORANDA, PUBLISHED IN THE WHITE PRESS. HOWEVER, IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME SUCH CONFLICTS, AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF THE "RUSSIAN TROUBLES", MILITARY STRUCTURES DICTATED THEIR DECISIONS, OFTEN WITH VIOLATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ARBITRARY INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN LEGAL SITUATIONS.
751	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE FEDERALISM PRINCIPLE IN TAX LEGAL RELATIONS. FOR THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE PROBLEM OF DISTRIBUTING TAX REVENUES AND POWERS OVER THE LEVELS OF THE BUDGET SYSTEM IS VERY RELEVANT. THE NEED FOR A COMPETENT DISTRIBUTION OF TAX REVENUES AND POWERS BETWEEN BUDGETS IN RUSSIA IS THE BASIS OF THE FINANCIAL WELL-BEING OF THE REGIONS AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THE URGENCY OF THIS PAPER IS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF OVERCOMING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS AND MODERNIZING THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE REVENUE SIDE OF BUDGETS OF ALL LEVELS, TO FIND ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF TAX REVENUES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE TAX POTENTIAL OF THE TERRITORIES. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MODEL OF TAX FEDERALISM THAT HAS DEVELOPED IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DESPITE THE REFORMS CARRIED OUT IN RECENT YEARS DOES NOT FULLY MEET THE PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM AND THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR THE LONG TERM, AND UNDOUBTEDLY NEEDS FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND MODERNIZATION. AT THE SAME TIME, IN A RULE-OF-LAW STATE WHERE POWER IS BOUND BY THE LAW, IMPROVEMENT OF TAX POLICY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IS UNDOUBTEDLY CONNECTED WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF TAX POLICY AND TAXATION, IMPROVEMENT OF TAX ADMINISTRATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTING LARGE-SCALE PROGRAMS FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY. THE DECISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TESTIFY TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ACTIVITY.
752	ARTICLE 21 OF THE TREATY OF LISBON MANDATES THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) TO FOSTER ITS VALUES (DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, SOCIAL RIGHTS, GENDER EQUALITY, ETC.) IN ITS EXTERNAL RELATIONS. THE CORE CONCERN OF THE EU'S MULTI-FACETED RELATIONS WITH ASIA IS ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH RISING MARKETS. EU RELATIONS WITH THE REGION HAVE FOCUSED ON THE FACILITATION OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT THROUGH THE NEGOTIATION OF FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (FTAS) WITH A NUMBER OF ASIAN PARTNERS. EU FTAS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A POLITICAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT (PCA), WHICH LINKS CORE EU VALUES TO TRADE THROUGH THE 'STANDARD CLAUSE', WHEREBY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, HUMAN RIGHTS' ABUSES CAN TRIGGER A SUSPENSION OF TRADE PREFERENCES. USING A QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY, AND DRAWING ON POLICY DOCUMENTS AND INTERVIEWS, THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER, AND HOW, THE EU CAN BALANCE ITS INTERNAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS WITH ITS ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND ITS PARTNERS' DEMANDS. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A LEGAL BACKGROUND OF THE EU'S OBLIGATIONS IN TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL VALUE PROMOTION. IT THEN REVIEWS EU TRADE POLICY STRATEGIES AND REVEALS AN ABSENCE OF A CONCERTED APPROACH TO THE INCLUSION OF VALUES. THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE SOURCES OF RESISTANCE TO EU ATTEMPTS AT LINKING ITS TRADE POLICY WITH BROADER VALUES INCLUDING SOCIAL RIGHTS WITH ASIAN PARTNERS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT ASIAN RESISTANCE IS CENTRED ON THE LEGALISTIC APPROACH OF THE EU RATHER THAN THE VALUES AND SUGGESTS THAT A MORE EFFECTIVE NORM EXPORT MIGHT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH OTHER MEANS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE EU'S FAILURE TO PUSH FORWARD SOCIAL ISSUES IN FTAS ULTIMATELY CASTS SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THE EU'S INTERNATIONAL 'ACTORNESS' IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL RIGHTS.
753	AS THE CONSTITUTION STIPULATES THAT "THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS CONDUCTS HOME AND FOREIGN POLICY" (ARTICLE 146.1), THE AUTHOR BEGINS HIS ARTICLE BY EMPHASIZING THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE TERM "POLICY". IT IS THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND ONLY THE COUNCIL WHICH IS EMPOWERED TO CONDUCT THE POLICY. HE EXPLAINS THE SOCIAL ROLES OF THE POLITICIAN, THE OFFICIAL (CIVIL SERVANT), AND THE EXPERT, AND DWELL UPON THE STATUS OF "RZAD FACHOWCOW" (A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT BY EXPERTS). THIS LEADS TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE COMPLEX ISSUES OF RESPONSIBILITY, THE IMPLICATIONS OF PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY, AND THE DUAL NATURE OF EXECUTIVE POWER UNDER THE CONSTITUTION (THE PRESIDENT, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS). THE AUTHOR ELABORATES ON THE DUTY OF THE PRESIDENT TO ACT - IN THE DOMAIN OF FOREIGN POLICY - IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE RELEVANT MINISTER (ARTICLE 133.3). POLICY ASSESSMENT AND/OR IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRES USE OF SUCH CRITERIA AS RAISON D'ETAT AND/OR NATIONAL INTEREST, AND IN POLAND THE NOTION OF CONSENSUAL POLICY HAS ALSO BECOME IMPORTANT AS PART AND PARCEL OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE ARTICLE BY PROPOSING TWO CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS: (1) ARTICLE 133.3 SHOULD REQUIRE THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTS AT THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS' REQUEST OR BY THE COUNCIL'S PREVIOUS CONSENT; AND (2) CLAUSE 144.3.4 SHOULD BE DELETED (PRESIDENT SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF THE PREROGATIVE TO INTRODUCE AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT). THE AUTHOR'S FINAL OBSERVATION IS THAT ALTHOUGH NOTHING WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT THE PROPER ACTIONS OF POLITICIANS, CIVIL SERVANTS AND EXPERTS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WITHOUT A PROPER SCHOOL EDUCATION THAT INCULCATES THE RULE OF LAW NOTHING WILL BE PERMANENT.
754	OBJECTIVES THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE HEALTH SYSTEMS GOVERNANCE FOR INJURY CARE IN THREE SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES FROM POLICYMAKERS' AND INJURY CARE PROVIDERS' PERSPECTIVES. SETTING GHANA, RWANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA. DESIGN BASED ON SIDDIQI ET AL'S FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNANCE, WE DEVELOPED AN ONLINE ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE FOR INJURY WITH 37 QUESTIONS COVERING HEALTH POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION UNDER 10 OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES OF STRATEGIC VISION, PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS ORIENTATION, RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIVENESS OF INSTITUTIONS, EQUITY, EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, ETHICS AND INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION. A LITERATURE REVIEW WAS ALSO DONE TO SUPPORT THE SCORING. WE DERIVED SCORES USING TWO METHODS-INVESTIGATOR SCORES AND RESPONDENT SCORES. PARTICIPANTS THE TOOL WAS SENT OUT TO PURPOSIVELY SELECTED STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING POLICYMAKERS AND INJURY CARE PROVIDERS IN GHANA, RWANDA AND SOUTH AFRICA. DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2020 AND FEBRUARY 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES INVESTIGATOR-WEIGHTED AND RESPONDENT PERCENTAGE SCORES FOR HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE FOR INJURY CARE. THIS WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH COUNTRY IN TOTAL AND PER PRINCIPLE. RESULTS RWANDA HAD THE HIGHEST OVERALL INVESTIGATOR-WEIGHTED PERCENTAGE SCORE (70%), FOLLOWED BY SOUTH AFRICA (59%). GHANA HAD THE LOWEST OVERALL INVESTIGATOR SCORE (48%). THE OVERALL RESULTS WERE SIMILAR FOR THE RESPONDENT SCORES. SOME AREAS, SUCH AS PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS, SCORED HIGH IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES, WHILE OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, SCORED VERY LOW. CONCLUSION IN THIS MULTICOUNTRY GOVERNANCE SURVEY, WE PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO AND EVALUATION OF HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE FOR TRAUMA IN THREE LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. IT HIGHLIGHTS AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT NEED TO BE PRIORITISED, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, TO MEET THE HIGH BURDEN OF TRAUMA AND INJURIES IN LMICS.
755	THE ADOPTION AND RATIFICATION PROCESS OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (ESM TREATY) HAS PRODUCED DEEP DEBATES ABOUT THIS PROCESS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION; ABOUT THE (LACK OF A) LINK BETWEEN THE TWO; ABOUT DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES WHICH ALLEGEDLY HAVE BEEN SHORT-CIRCUITED IN THE RUSH TO A POLITICAL/FINANCIAL MECHANISM; ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF FINANCE AND EXPEDIENCY. THREE DECADES AGO, ESTONIA WAS PART OF A DIFFERENT CONSTELLATION. NOW, A PART OF THE EU FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST DECADE, THE DEBATE ABOUT SMALL VERSUS LARGE, ABOUT RULES FOR ALL AND PROCEDURES FOR SOME RAISE ISSUES WHICH TOUCH NOT ONLY ESTONIA; THEY ARE ONES WHICH CAN CROSS THE BORDERS INTO OTHER ECONOMIC ASSOCIATIONS AND UNIONS, SUCH AS THE CIS OR THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EAEC OR EURASEC). THE AUTHORS OF THIS ARTICLE SEEK TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES REGARDING THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE ESM TREATY. SEVERAL OF THE LEGISLATIVE CHOICES MADE IN THE ESM TREATY HAVE PASSED WITHOUT SUFFICIENT PUBLIC DEBATE OR TRANSPARENCY. A THESIS IS PRESENTED HERE THAT SOME SOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE ESM TREATY HAVE A DUBIOUS VALUE IN THE CONTEXT OF EU LAW AS WELL AS IN THE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE EU. THE ARTICLE PINPOINTS A SHIFT IN THE VOTING POWERS TO THE DETRIMENT OF SMALLER MEMBER STATES. ABOVE ALL, THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU (CJEU) ARE QUESTIONED. THE ARTICLE REACHES A GENERALIZED CONCLUSION THAT DEVIATION FROM THE CURRENT DECISION PROCESSES AND STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY CAN BE JUSTIFIABLE ONLY IF SUCH A CHANGE IS SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
756	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CAUSES OF THE INCREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN THEORETICAL ISSUES OF LEGAL LIABILITY. RESEARCH GOAL IS TO FIND THE MOST GROUNDED CONCEPT OF LEGAL LIABILITY AND MAINTAINING A CRITICAL APPRAISAL FROM DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES. PROVIDES HISTORICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE NOTION AND ESSENCE OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, JUSTIFICATION OF POSITIVE AND RETROSPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY, THE RATIO OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. ASSESSES THE THEORY OF "TWO ASPECT LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY", ACCORDING TO WHICH IN ADDITION TO LEGAL LIABILITY FOR THE OFFENSE AND IN CLOSE CONNECTION WITH IT THERE IS A POSITIVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY (CONSCIOUSNESS OF DUTY, THE DUTY TO TAKE ACTIONS APPROPRIATE TO THE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL SYSTEM). SHOWS THE CONTRIBUTION OF BELARUSIAN LAWYERS IN THE DEFINITION OF THE NOTION AND ESSENCE OF LEGAL LIABILITY, IN THE STUDY OF ITS INDIVIDUAL SPECIES. IT IS SHOWN THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF XXI CENTURY THE INTEREST OF THE GENERAL THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF LEGAL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NECESSITY OF FURTHER DEMOCRATIZATION OF MODERN POLITICAL REGIMES OF THE POST-SOVIET STATES. EXPLAINS THAT THE EXISTING THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY LARGELY EXACERBATED BY THE ABSENCE TO DATE OF NORMATIVE REGULATION OF THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY, DIFFERENT APPROACHES LEGISLATORS CIS COUNTRIES TO DETERMINING ITS CONTENT, PURPOSES AND TYPES, WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY TO CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD. IT CONCLUDES THAT IF IN THE PAST THE UNDERSTANDING OF MANY ISSUES OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LEGAL SCIENCE WAS MORE APPLIED NATURE, THEN AT THE PRESENT STAGE IN THE THEORY OF LAW, IT GAINED METHODOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL MEANING.
757	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES, AND THOROUGHLY ANALYZES, THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT STATE OF NATIONAL SECURITY PROCESSES IN UKRAINE. ALSO, WAYS OF POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT OF THE STATE OF ENSURING THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF UKRAINE IN THE MODERN CONDITIONS OF THE ACTIVE OPERATION OF THE MARTIAL LAW REGIME ARE CONSIDERED. IT IS NOTED THAT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION, TEND TO INTERPRET THE ESSENCE AND IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD TODAY. IN ADDITION, COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE REAL ACTION IN RELATION TO REFORMING THE SITUATION WITH THEIR NATIONAL SECURITY. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT TRULY HIGH-QUALITY AND DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPHERE OF PROPER PROVISION OF NATIONAL SECURITY OCCURS IN THE STATE ONLY WHEN IT IS UNDER THREAT (ITS STATE SOVEREIGNTY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, OR OTHER IMPORTANT INTERESTS). THE EXAMPLE OF ISRAEL, THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHERE ONLY AFTER THE EMERGENCE OF THIS OR THAT DANGER, THE MECHANISMS AND TOOLS TO OVERCOME IT BEGIN TO WORK IN PRACTICE. ALSO, THE IMPORTANCE OF ACHIEVING UKRAINE'S FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATO MILITARY AND POLITICAL ALLIANCE WAS EMPHASIZED. AFTER ALL, THIS MILITARY AND POLITICAL ALLIANCE, WHICH UNITES ABOUT THREE DOZEN SOVEREIGN STATES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE TRUE LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES WITH REAL RULE OF LAW AND A TRANSPARENT AND EFFECTIVE STATE SYSTEM, IS RECOGNIZED AS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF SUCH A DEFENSE ALLIANCE IN HISTORY OF HUMANITY AND IS A GOOD ASSOCIATION OF STATES CLOSE TO UKRAINE IN SPIRIT. IT IS INDICATED THAT AFTER REPELLING THE RUSSIAN INVASION, UKRAINE SHOULD FOCUS ALL EFFORTS ON JOINING NATO.
758	WHEN FERDINAND VON SCHIRACH WROTE TERROR, A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE LEGAL THEATRE WAS CREATED. IT IS A TRIAL OR TRIBUNAL PLAY THAT DEALS BOTH WITH CURRENT LEGAL ISSUES AND A PROFOUND LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL DILEMMA OF SACRIFICING HUMAN LIVES FOR THE LIVES OF OTHERS. MOREOVER, THIS PLAY PROVIDES A SPACE FOR THE AUDIENCE TO EXPRESS THEIR LEGAL OPINION IN A VERY THEATRICAL WAY. IN A SENSE, THIS PLAY REFERS TO THE ROOTS OF ANCIENT GREEK THEATRE (SEE EG GAAKEER 2019) AND ITS FUNDAMENTALLY POLITICAL MEANING.THUS, IT MAY SEEM THAT THIS PLAY IS AN ANSWER TO EVERY LAW AND THEATRE SCHOLAR'S PRAYER FOR A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF A WIDELY KNOW TRIAL PLAY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.IN A WAY, ANY THEATRE ABOUT LAW - LEGAL THEATRE - IS POLITICAL THEATRE. THROUGH ITS INFLUENCE, LEGAL THEATRE CAN POSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY.IN THIS TEXT, I WILL FOCUS ON THE SPECIFICS OF LEGAL THEATRE AND ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES. MY RESEARCH TAKES THE FORM OF A CASE-STUDY OF FERDINAND VON SCHIRACH'S PLAY TERROR. FOR COMPARISON, ANOTHER LEGAL THEATRE PLAY WILL BE USED: MILADA. MILADA IS A DOCUMENTARY THEATRE PLAY BASED ON A REAL POLITICAL TRIAL CONCERNING MILADA HORAKOVA IN THE 1950S IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF BOTH PLAYS, I WILL DETERMINE AND EXPLAIN THE MOST PROBLEMATIC ISSUES. THIS ISSUES ARE, OF COURSE, TOO BROAD TO DEAL WITH IN ONE PAPER, SO I WILL FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF 'REALITY' IN THE PRESENTATION OF LAW IN BOTH PLAYS AND ITS POSSIBLY DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF CENTRAL EUROPE.
759	DIGITAL DATA GENERATED IN THE COURSE OF CLINICAL CARE ARE INCREASINGLY BEING LEVERAGED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF SECONDARY PURPOSES. RESEARCHERS NEED TO DEVELOP GOVERNANCE POLICIES THAT CAN ASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING USED RESPONSIBLY. OUR AIM WAS TO DEVELOP A GENERALISABLE MODEL FOR GOVERNANCE OF RESEARCH EMANATING FROM HEALTH DATA REPOSITORIES THAT WILL INVOKE THE TRUST OF THE PATIENTS AND THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHOSE DATA ARE BEING ACCESSED FOR HEALTH RESEARCH. WE DEVELOPED OUR GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND PROCESSES THROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW AND ITERATIVE CONSULTATION WITH KEY ACTORS IN THE RESEARCH NETWORK INCLUDING: A DATA GOVERNANCE WORKING GROUP, THE LEAD INVESTIGATORS AND PATIENT ADVISORS. WE THEN RECRUITED PERSONS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNING AND ADVISORY BODIES. OUR GOVERNANCE PROCESS IS INFORMED BY EIGHT PRINCIPLES: (1) TRANSPARENCY; (2) ACCOUNTABILITY; (3) FOLLOW RULE OF LAW; (4) INTEGRITY; (5) PARTICIPATION AND INCLUSIVENESS; (6) IMPARTIALITY AND INDEPENDENCE; (7) EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS AND (8) REFLEXIVITY AND CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE DESCRIBE THE RATIONALE FOR THESE PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE SUBSEQUENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WE DEVELOPED. WE THEN DESCRIBE THE FUNCTION OF THE RESEARCH GOVERNING COMMITTEE, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE EITHER PERSONS LIVING WITH DIABETES OR PHYSICIANS WHOSE DATA ARE BEING USED, AND THE PATIENT AND DATA PROVIDER ADVISORY GROUPS WITH WHOM THEY CONSULT AND COMMUNICATE. IN CONCLUSION, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A VALUES-BASED INFORMATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AND PROCESS FOR DIABETES ACTION CANADA THAT ADDS VALUE OVER-AND-ABOVE EXISTING SCIENTIFIC AND ETHICS REVIEW PROCESSES BY ADDING A STRONG PATIENT PERSPECTIVE AND CONTEXTUAL INTEGRITY. THIS MODEL IS ADAPTABLE TO OTHER SECURE DATA REPOSITORIES.
760	THERE IS GROWING EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS ON EXPLAINING AFRICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AHEAD OF THE TRADITIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS CAPITAL ACCUMULATION. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE INDICATORS NAMELY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY MATTER MOST. THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA. THE PAPER USES A SAMPLE OF 48 COUNTRIES FOR THE 1996-2016 PERIOD. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IS 912. THE PAPER APPLIED GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENT (GMM), FIXED EFFECTS (FE) AND RANDOM EFFECTS (RE) MODELS. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT GMM IS WELL SUITED TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY PROBLEMS IN THE MODEL, INFERENTIAL STATISTICS OF THIS PAPER ARE DRAWN FROM GMM REGRESSION RESULTS. RESULTS OF THE FE AND RE REGRESSIONS ARE PRESENTED IN APPENDIX. EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONS REALLY MATTER FOR AFRICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS POLITICAL STABILITY APPEARS TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN EXPLAINING REAL GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH IN AFRICA. HOWEVER, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT, THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS ALONE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. ALONG WITH INSTITUTIONS, THE PAPER REVEALS THAT STRUCTURAL FACTORS SUCH AS LIBERALIZATION OF TRADE, FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION, LABOUR FORCE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON AFRICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT, A POLICY MIX WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS REDUCING TRADE RESTRICTIONS, ENHANCING BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LABOUR FORCE WOULD ENHANCE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA.
761	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO COMPARE VISITOR PERSPECTIVES OF THE GOVERNANCE OF TWO OF CANADA'S LARGEST PARK SYSTEMS: THE PARASTATAL MODEL OF ONTARIO PROVINCIAL PARKS AND THE PUBLIC AND FOR-PROFIT COMBINATION MODEL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCIAL PARKS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED AN ELECTRONIC SURVEY BASED ON THE TEN UNDP CRITERIA OF GOVERNANCE: STRATEGIC VISION, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, CONSENSUS-ORIENTATION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS, RESPONSIVENESS, EQUITY, AND RULE OF LAW. THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED TO PARK VISITORS FOR BOTH PARK SYSTEMS IN THE SUMMER OF 2008 AND SPRING OF 2009 ( BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCIAL PARKS N 112, ONTARIO PROVINCIAL PARKS N=255). FINDINGS - RESEARCHERS DETERMINED THAT THE TEN GOVERNANCE SECTIONS OF THE SURVEY ACTUALLY FORM 11 GOVERNANCE FACTORS. DATA SUGGESTED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REGARDS TO THE VISITORS' PERCEPTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO PARK SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY, VISITORS TO ONTARIO PARKS RANKED ALL 11 CRITERIA OF GOVERNANCE HIGHER, CLOSER TOWARDS GOOD GOVERNANCE, THAN DID VISITORS TO BRITISH COLUMBIA PARKS (P < 0.001). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ONTARIO PARKS PARASTATAL MODEL IS CLOSER TO THE IDEALS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AS PERCEIVED BY THE PARK USERS, WHEN COMPARED TO THE BRITISH COLUMBIA PARKS' PUBLIC AND FOR-PROFIT COMBINATION MODEL. THIS PAPER ALSO PROVIDES FUTURE POLICY MAKERS WITH A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT AFFECT VISITORS EXPERIENCE AND PERCEPTIONS OF PROTECTED AREAS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE VISITORS' PERCEPTIONS OF TWO COMMONLY USED PROTECTED AREA MANAGEMENT MODELS. THESE RESEARCH FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE REGARDING WHICH PROTECTED AREA MANAGEMENT MODEL IS SUPERIOR WHEN COMPARED USING THE UNDP GOVERNANCE CRITERIA.
762	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CLARIFY THE CONTENT OF THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE AND DEFEND ITS HISTORICAL PEDIGREE BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE SUPREME COURT'S VAGUENESS DECISIONS-THAT VAGUENESS ANALYSIS SIGNIFICANTLY DE-PENDS ON WHETHER THE LAW AT ISSUE IS A FEDERAL OR STATE LAW. THAT SIMPLE DISTINCTION HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPLANATORY POWER. IT REVEALS THAT THE DOCTRINE EMERGED IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN RESPONSE TO TWO SIMULTANEOUS CHANGES IN THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE- FIRST, THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPREME COURT DUE PROCESS REVIEW OF STATE PENAL STATUTES UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, AND SECOND, A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN HOW STATE COURTS CONSTRUED THOSE STATUTES. THE FEDERAL-STATE DISTINCTION ALSO DIVIDES THE COURT'S DECI-SIONS INTO TWO GROUPS WITH MOSTLY SEPARATE CONCERNS. IT REVEALS THAT SEPARATION-OF -POWERS CONCERNS PRIMARILY MOTIVATE THE COURT'S VAGUENESS DECISIONS INVOLVING FED-ERAL LAWS, WHILE FEDERALISM CONCERNS ARE THE DRIVING FORCE IN ITS VAGUENESS DECISIONS INVOLVING STATE LAWS. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES INVOLVING A FEDERAL LAW, THE COURT WILL NARROWLY CONSTRUE THE LAW TO AVOID VAGUENESS CONCERNS. IN CASES INVOLVING A STATE LAW, BY CONTRAST, THE COURT WILL FOLLOW ANY PREEXISTING STATE-COURT CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAW, HOWEVER INDEFINITE IT MAY BE, WITH THE RESULT THAT VAGUENESS ANALYSIS AMOUNTS TO A DUE PROCESS LIMITATION ON JUDICIAL CONSTRUCTION. PROPER RECOGNITION OF THE FEDERAL-STATE DISTINCTION WOULD RESULT IN FEWER VAGUENESS CASES THAT REACH THE SUPREME COURT AND MORE PENAL LAWS THAT ARE NARROWLY CONSTRUED. THAT WOULD PRO-MOTE THE RULE OF LAW BY INCREASING THE PRECISION OF CRIMINAL LAWS AND REDUCING THE RISK OF ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT-THE VERY GOALS THE VAGUENESS DOCTRINE SEEKS TO ACHIEVE.
763	THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO RECONSTRUCT STANISLAW EHRLICH'S CRITIQUE OF LEGAL DOGMATICS BY WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD A LEGAL DISCIPLINE THAT EXPLAINS IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER THE NORMATIVE MATERIAL WHICH CONSISTS OF DESCRIPTION, CLASSIFICATION AND SYSTEMATIZATION OF NORMS. AS AN ADDITIONAL AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REMIND ABOUT EHRLICH'S ACHIEVEMENTS AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE REGIONAL LEGAL THEORY, THIS IS PRECEDED BY THE AUTHOR'S BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF EHRLICH'S CRITIQUE OF LEGAL DOGMATICS CONSISTS OF THREE ELEMENTS. FIRSTLY, I DISCUSS THE AUTHOR'S UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL DOGMATICS AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DOMESTIC LEGAL THEORY. SECONDLY, I CONSIDER THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND OF EHRLICH'S CRITIQUE OF LEGAL DOGMATICS AND I ARGUE THAT IT MIGHT BE SEEN AS A PART OF THREE BROADER THREADS IN THE AUTHOR'S WRITINGS: REALISM, DECISION-FOCUSED CONCEPT OF LAW AND PLURALISM. FINALLY, I RECONSTRUCT EHRLICH'S CRITIQUE OF LEGAL DOGMATICS FORMULATED IN THE 1950S AND IN THE 1960S. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF SUMMARY AND CONSIDERATION OF EHRLICH'S POSSIBLE APPLICATION IN THE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD LEGAL THEORY. I SHALL ARGUE THAT EHRLICH'S CRITIQUE OF LEGAL DOGMATICS AND HIS REALISTIC CONCEPT OF LAW MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR ALL WHO EXAMINE THE LAW IN ITS BROADER SOCIAL CONTEXT, LOOKING AT IT FROM THE EXTERNAL POINT OF VIEW, ADOPTING CRITICAL AS WELL AS POSTANALYTICAL ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE LAW. AS POSSIBLE FIELDS OF EHRLICH'S APPLICATION, I IDENTIFY ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON RULE OF LAW, LEGAL EDUCATION, ADJUDICATION AND JUDICIAL FORMALISM. I SHALL ALSO ARGUE THAT EHRLICH'S REALISTIC CONCEPT OF THE LAW REMAINS AN INTERESTING PIECE OF CENTRAL EASTERN EUROPEAN CRITICAL THOUGHT.
764	IN RECENT YEARS, ARTICLE III COURTS HAVE BECOME THE PREFERRED VENUE FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO TRY TERRORISM SUSPECTS CAPTURED ABROAD. MANY LIBERALS HAVE WELCOMED THIS DEVELOPMENT, CHARACTERIZING IT AS A PROPER EXTENSION OF AMERICAN RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES TO THE SO-CALLED "WAR ON TERROR." BUT WHILE MANY HAVE CELEBRATED THE MARGINALIZATION OF THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL SYSTEM, FEW HAVE DIRECTLY ACKNOWLEDGED ITS POTENTIAL COSTS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ONE OF THOSE COSTS: REDUCED PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR ARTICLE III DEFENDANTS AGAINST STATEMENTS PROCURED THROUGH COERCIVE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES. AS COURTS HAVE REPEATEDLY RECOGNIZED, THE CORE PURPOSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT'S SELF-INCRIMINATION CLAUSE IS TO ENSURE THAT THE ACCUSED IS NOT COMPELLED TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIMSELF IN A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. MORE CONTROVERSIALLY, MIRANDA WARNINGS GIVE EFFECT TO THAT PURPOSE BY REQUIRING THAT ANY STATEMENTS ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE BE THE PRODUCT OF A SUSPECT'S VOLUNTARY AND INFORMED CHOICE. HOWEVER, WHERE MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY ARE IMPLICATED, THERE IS A DANGER THAT PROSECUTIONS OF EXTRATERRITORIAL CRIMES WILL CAUSE OUR DOMESTIC COURTS TO BEND OR ABANDON TRADITIONAL RULES OF AMERICAN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTIONS AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION. THROUGH A COMPARISON OF CURRENT LEGAL DOCTRINE WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S PRE-INCORPORATION JURISPRUDENCE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT COURTS SHOULD BE MORE, NOT LESS, VIGILANT IN THEIR REVIEW OF CONFESSIONS OBTAINED ABROAD, ESPECIALLY BY REGIMES THAT ARE KNOWN TO ENGAGE IN TORTURE. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, THE OPPOSITE HAS OCCURRED. FOREIGN INTERROGATION PRACTICES ARE SUBJECT TO FAR FEWER CONSTRAINTS THAN DOMESTIC ONES. THAT REALIZATION OUGHT TO GIVE SOME PAUSE TO THOSE WHO TOUT THE SUPPOSED VIRTUES OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
765	THIS ESSAY INITIALLY CONSIDERS CENTRAL PATTERNS IN HONG YING'S WORK, INCLUDING: THE AESTHETIC SELF IN OPPOSITION TO IDEOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL IDENTITY; AND, ARTISTIC METAMORPHOSIS AND ITS INEVITABLE CONFRONTATION WITH FORCES UNDERLYING THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IN SUMMER OF BETRAYAL INVOLVES PROTAGONIST LING YING IN THE EVENTS OF JUNE 1989 IN TIANANMEN SQUARE AND THEIR AFTERMATH. PART OF BEIJING'S YOUNG, LIBERAL ARTISTIC ELITE SHE FINALLY DANCES NAKED IN DEFIANCE OF BOTH PRIVILEGED FELLOW STUDENTS, AND THE POLICE AS REPRESENTING AN OVERARCHING PATRIARCHAL ORDER. OVERALL THIS PIECE EXPLORES THEMES OF HOME, LONGING, EXILE AND RECONCILIATION IN K: THE ART OF LOVE, AND HOW ITS AUTHOR RETRIEVES A FORGOTTEN EPISODE LINKING CHINA AND BLOOMSBURY-AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE JAPANESE INVASION AND CHINESE CIVIL WAR-AND SKETCHES A STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY AND CREATIVITY IN THE 1930S THROUGH HER DEPICTION OF THE ILLICIT LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN TWO INTELLECTUALS AND WRITERS, ENGLISHMAN JULIAN BELL AND THE WIFE OF HIS DEAN AT WUHAN UNIVERSITY. BOTH REPRESENT ASPECTS OF BOHEMIAN AVANT-GARDE INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENTS. TEW READS IN DETAIL THE NOVEL'S OPENING DESCRIBING BELL'S DEATH IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR, AND THE TEXTS SENSE OF THE SPECTRAL AND TRAUMATIC RUPTURE WHICH BOTH HAUNT THE LOVERS, UNDERPINNING THE NARRATIVE'S VISCERAL RELATIONSHIP TO BLOOMSBURY. ALSO CONSIDERED ARE THEMES OF SACRIFICE, VIOLENCE AND DEATH UNDERLYING LIBIDINOUS DESIRE, ETHNIC AND CULTURAL IDENTITY, UNCANNY DOUBLINGS, AND THE MATERNAL. FINALLY THROUGH ITS DEPICTION OF LOSS, LONGING, SELF-DISCOVERY AND PASSION, THE NOVEL CAN BE REGARDED AS INTERFUSING THE EXOTIC AND THE FAMILIAR, RECONCILING HOME AND EXILE, AND THROUGH AN INTERCULTURAL ARS MORIENDI IT SUGGESTS AESTHETICALLY LARGER, UNIVERSAL, HUMANISTIC RECONCILIATIONS.
766	CORRUPTION WITHIN PUBLIC SERVICES HAS DEVASTATED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON A STATE, A SOCIETY, ITS ECONOMY AND ITS CITIZENS. IT REPRESENTS A MAJOR THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, FAIRNESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. IT HINDERS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENDANGERES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, EMPOWERISHES NATIONAL ECONOMIES, AND FACILITATES THE EMERGENCE OF OTHER THREATS, SUCH AS ORGANIZED CRIME. FIGHTING CORRUPTION HAS BECOME MORE URGENT THAN EVER. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE PUBLIC LIABILITY OF DOMESTIC PUBLIC OFFICIALS, HIGHLIGHTING THE SUBSTANTIVE MAIN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR FIGHTING CORRUPTION IN PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS AGAINST CORRUPTION, AND THE TWO CONVENTION OF COUNCIL OF EUROPE, ON CIVIL LAW AND ON CRIMINAL LAW. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT CORRUPTION CAN BE PROSECUTED AFTER THE FACT, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST IT REQUIRES PREVENTION. PREVENTIVE POLICIES INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANTI-CORRUPTION BODIES AND ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY IN THE FINANCING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND POLITICAL PARTIES. STATES MUST ENDEAVOUR TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PUBLIC SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO SAFEGUARDS THAT PROMOTE EFFICIENCY, TRANSPARENCY AND RECRUITMENT BASED ON MERIT. ONCE RECRUITED, PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO CODES OF CONDUCT, REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL AND OTHER DISCLOSURES, AND APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN MATTERS OF PUBLIC FINANCE MUST ALSO BE PROMOTED, AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION IN PARTICULARLY CRITICAL AREAS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR SUCH AS THE JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC PROCUREMENT. THOSE WHO USE PUBLIC SERVICES MUST EXPECT A HIGH STANDARD OF CONDUCT FROM THEIR PUBLIC SERVANTS. PREVENTING PUBLIC CORRUPTION ALSO REQUIRES AN EFFORT FROM ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AT LARGE.
767	VIOLENCE IS ONE OF THE QUALITIES THAT FORM THE BASIS OF OUR EXISTENCE. THE VIOLENCE THAT WALTER BENJAMIN, WHO HAS A PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF FRENCH THOUGHT, DEALS WITH THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF HISTORY, GROUNDS THE TRANSITION OF MAN FROM NATURAL LIFE TO SETTLED LIFE AND UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE LAW IS ALSO IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE SOVEREIGN. THEREFORE, IT IS OPEN TO CORRUPTION OVER TIME. BENJAMIN STATES THAT THIS CORRUPTION WILL END WITH AN OPPOSITION, A MESSIANIC VIOLENCE. WHILE LEGAL VIOLENCE MAKES PEOPLE UNIFORM, MESSIANIC VIOLENCE IS IN PERSONAL FORM. ACCORDING TO BENJAMIN, PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES IN MOMENTS OF BREAKING WHEN LAW-MAKING AND LAW-PROTECTING VIOLENCE IS APPLIED. BASED ON THIS STATEMENT, THE PURPOSE IS TO CREATE AND GROUND A CHILDLIKE FORM OF VIOLENCE ABOUT THE CHILD, WHOM BENJAMIN SAYS IS RUNNING AMONG THE RUINS OF HISTORY. THIS CHILDISH FORM IS INHERENT VIOLENCE AND THE INDIVIDUAL'S FORMATION OF SELF THROUGH QUESTIONING AND OBJECTION. TIME AND SPACE DISRUPTION, SUCH A PERSON OPENS A NEW SPACE IN SOCIETY WHERE HE MANIFESTS HIMSELF. CHILDISH IMMANENT VIOLENCE CORRESPONDS TO THE MOMENT'S STOP, TIME'S SUSPENDING, AND A BREACH OF THE LAW. THESE HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT AS THE PHOTO. THE ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE SEEN AND THE UNSEEN, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SOCIETY AND THE LAW. THE PERSON WHO USES CHILDISH INHERENT VIOLENCE BECOMES BARBARIC AND ALIEN COMPARED TO OTHERS AND IS NEITHER INSIDE NOR OUTSIDE. IN SHORT, IT SUSPENDS THE ENTIRE FLOW. ORI GERSCHT'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF DESTRUCTION IN THE TEXT WILL PRESENT EXAMPLES OF THIS THEME.
768	AS A PRODUCT OF SCIENTISM AND RATIONALISM, THE PRINCIPLE OF NULLUM CRIMEN SINE LEGE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO CHANGING TIMES AND THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS. IN PRACTICE, THEREFORE, IT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ABLE TO PLAY ITS ROLE IN PROTECTING FREEDOM AND HAS CONSTANTLY WAVERED OVER THE DETERMINATION OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENTS. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED, THE PRINCIPLE OF NULLUM CRIMEN SINE LEGE SHOULD BE ADHERED TO AND RENEWED AS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW. FIRST, THE PRINCIPLE OF DE LEGE LATA IS BEING QUESTIONED BY THEORIES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW, AND SOURCES NOT IN THE FORM OF LAW HAVE BECOME THE DE FACTO BASIS OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS NECESSARY TO REAFFIRM THE NATURE OF DE LEGE LATA AS AN EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF LAW. SECOND, ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBLE BOUNDARY OF THE MEANING OF CRIMINAL LAW TEXTS CANNOT BE CLEARLY DELINEATED EMPIRICALLY, ONE SHOULD NOT THEREFORE REJECT THE POSSIBLE BOUNDARY OF THIS MEANING. THE PRACTICE OF DELINEATING AN OBJECTIVE BOUNDARY BASED ON EMPIRICAL FACTS SHOULD BE ABANDONED AND NORMATIVE BOUNDARIES SHOULD BE DELINEATED AND JUSTIFIED. FINALLY, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR JUDICIAL CLARITY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND ACCEPTED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO LEGISLATIVE CLARITY, AND A TWO-TIER SYSTEM OF LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL CLARITY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. HERE, THE DEFINITE NATURE OF CRIMINAL LEGISLATION SHOULD DEVELOP STANDARDS IN TERMS OF BEHAVIORAL GUIDANCE AND JUDICIAL RESTRICTIONS, AND CLARITY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SHOULD START FROM THE LEGISLATIVE TEXT AND ESTABLISH GENERAL SECONDARY RULES TO MAKE THE TEXT MORE SPECIFIC, BRINGING IT EVER CLOSER TO SPECIFIC AND PARTICULAR CASE FACTS, AND EVENTUALLY ESTABLISHING A RELATIONSHIP OF SUBSUMPTION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE TEXT AND THE FACTS OF THE CASE.
769	THIS STUDY ADDRESSED THE KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDING SOUTH AFRICAN PARENTS' VIEW OF THEIR ROLE IN THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN AS DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PARENTS OF CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 8 YEARS IN 2 MULTICULTURAL PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN GAUTENG, SOUTH AFRICA. THE EXPLANATORY SEQUENTIAL MIXED METHODS RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA FROM PARENTS IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTION. THE QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE GATHERED FIRST BY MEANS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE, AND AFTERWARDS THE QUALITATIVE DATA WERE GATHERED BY MEANS OF SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SHOWED THAT WHEN EDUCATING THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN TO DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP, PARTICIPATING PARENTS CONSIDER VARIOUS VALUES OF A DEMOCRATIC CITIZEN AS IMPORTANT INCLUDING RESPONSIBILITY, RESPECT, PARTICIPATION, NORMS AND VALUES, PEACEBUILDING, LOVE, LOYALTY, DELIBERATIONS, KINDNESS, COMMITMENT, NON-RACISM, NON-SEXISM, EQUALITY, RECONCILIATION, SELF-CONTROL, FORGIVENESS, COMPASSION, TOLERANCE, OPEN-MINDEDNESS, A SENSE OF BELONGING, RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. PARTICIPATING PARENTS ALSO REGARD THEIR EXAMPLE AS DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS, RESPECT, PARTICIPATION AND THE CREATION OF A SAFE, PROUD AND FREE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AS IMPORTANT. THEY DID, HOWEVER, CONSIDER THE MEDIA AND OTHER BAD ROLE MODELS AS CHALLENGES WHEN EDUCATING THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN TOWARDS DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP. THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING OF THE STUDY IS THE INFLUENCE OF NEGATIVE SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS ON THE ATTITUDES AND OPINIONS OF THE PARTICIPATING PARENTS. NEW INSIGHTS THAT EMERGED FROM THE STUDY INCLUDES THAT THESE PARENTS WANT TO DO THEIR BEST TO EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN AS DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS IN SOUTH AFRICA, IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR CHILDREN AS FUTURE DEMOCRATIC CITIZENS, BUT ARE HINDERED BY CERTAIN SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS.
770	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE USE OF BELLWETHER MEDIATION IN MASS LITIGATION. BELLWETHER MEDIATIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM " BELLWETHER TRIALS," A PRACTICE WHERE PARTIES CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF CASES FOR TRIAL TO DETERMINE HOW TO RESOLVE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF SIMILAR CASES. IN BELLWETHER MEDIATIONS, THE PARTIES INSTEAD RELY ON A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF SETTLEMENT OUTCOMES OVERSEEN BY JUDGES AND COURT-APPOINTED MEDIATORS. THE HOPE BEHIND BELLWETHER MEDIATION IS THAT DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT OUTCOMES, NOT TRIALS, WILL OFFER THE PARTIES CRUCIAL BUILDING BLOCKS TO FORGE A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL RESOLUTION. IN SO DOING, THE PROCESS ATTEMPTS TO (1) YIELD IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CLAIMS, REMEDIES, AND STRATEGIES THAT PARTIES OFTEN WOULD NOT SHARE IN PREPARATION FOR A HIGH-STAKES TRIAL; (2) AVOID OUTLIER OR CLUSTERING VERDICTS THAT THREATEN A GLOBAL RESOLUTION FOR ALL THE CLAIMS; AND (3) BUILD TRUST AMONG COUNSEL IN WAYS THAT DO NOT USUALLY OCCUR UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE LITIGATION PROCESS. THE EMBRACE OF SUCH " BELLWETHER SETTLEMENTS" RAISES NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLES OF THE JUDGE AND JURY IN MASS LITIGATION. WHAT FUNCTION DO COURTS SERVE WHEN LARGE CASES PUSH JUDGES OUTSIDE THEIR TRADITIONAL ROLES AS ADJUDICATORS OF ADVERSE CLAIMS, SUPERVISORS OF CONTROLLED FACT-FINDING, AND INTERPRETERS OF LAW? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, AS IN OTHER AREAS OF AGGREGATE LITIGATION, COURTS CAN PLAY A VITAL " INFORMATION-FORCING" ROLE IN BELLWETHER SETTLEMENT PRACTICE. EVEN IN A SYSTEM DOMINATED BY SETTLEMENT, JUDGES CAN HELP PARTIES SET GROUND RULES, OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION, AND, IN THE PROCESS, MAKE MORE REASONED TRADE-OFFS. IN SO DOING, COURTS PROTECT THE PROCEDURAL, SUBSTANTIVE, AND RULE-OF-LAW VALUES THAT AGGREGATE SETTLEMENTS MAY THREATEN.
771	THE LAW 8.080/90 WHICH REGULATES THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM INCLUDES THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEILLANCE, EXPANDING THE CONCEPT. HOWEVER LEGALLY THIS FIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH REMAINS SUBJECT TO THE LAW 6.259/1975. BILLS ARE BEING DRAFTED TO REPLACE THE LATTER, BUT THEY ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE TO THE 8.080 ACT. MOREVER THE PROMULGATION OF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (RSI/2005) REQUIRES THAT THE COUNTRY ELABORATES LEGAL INSTRUMENT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PRESENT SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE PRELIMINARIES DRAFTS OF LAWS PRESENTED AND THEIR POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS IN THE PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION OF PRINCIPLES THAT GUIDE THE BRAZILIAN SANITARY REFORM. IT DESCRIBES THE CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE IN BRAZIL, HIGHLIGHTING THE LAW TO WHICH THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEILLANCE IS SUBJECT. MOREOVER, THIS LAW HAS BEEN PROMULGATED DURING THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP IT DID NOT MENTION PUNISHMENTS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, THESE PRELIMINARIES DRAFTS OF PROJECTS INCLUDE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HEALTH VIOLATIONS AND CRIMES WHICH IS REJECTED BY THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED WITH THE FIELD OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ONCE THIS COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT SUCH DEVICES ARE AUTHORITARIANS, RESTRAINTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND THAT THEY VIOLATE RIGHTS SUCH AS THE HUMAN DIGNITY. IF IT IS NECESSARY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A NEW LAW FOR THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE BRAZILIAN HEALTH REFORM AND THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT RESTRICTIVE MEASURES SHOULD BE TRANSITOR AND CAREFULLY ELABORATE TO AVOID ARBITRARY ACTS FROM AUTHORITIES, ON BEHALF OF THE NECESSITY OF USING FORCE TO CONTROL RISKS TO HEALTH.
772	THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY SAW AN APPARENT CHANGE IN LANGUAGE IN PUBLIC DISCOURSES CHARACTERISED BY THE RISE OF SO-CALLED "ESSENTIALLY OXYMORONIC CONCEPTS", I.E., MAINLY OXYMORA AND PARADOXES. IN EARLIER TIMES, THESE RHETORICAL FIGURES OF SPEECH WERE LARGELY RESERVED FOR THE DOMAIN OF LITERATURE, THE ARTS OR MYSTICISM. TODAY, HOWEVER, MANY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER INNOVATIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR RISE ALSO IN THE DOMAINS OF SCIENCE AND OF LAW. PARTICULARLY IN LAW, THEIR INHERENT CONTRADICTORY QUALITY OF COMBINING APPARENTLY ANTAGONISTIC SUPPOSITIONS CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL DUALISTIC MODE OF REASONING AND BINARY LOGIC. AS REFLECTED IN TERMS LIKE FAKE NEWS, ALTERNATIVE FACTS OR CONSPIRACY THEORIES, THESE CONCEPTS ARE SEEN AS A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CERTAINTY AND HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS HARBINGERS OF AN AGE OF DISINFORMATION OR POST-TRUTH. THE CHALLENGE POSED BY THESE APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY CONCEPTS REQUIRES A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PREMISES THAT GUIDE OUR LEGAL THINKING AND A MORE INTEGRATED THEORY OF THE SENSES AND THEIR ROLE IN LAW, AS CAPTURED BY THE TERMS "LEGAL SYNAESTHESIA" AND "LEGAL SEMIOTICS". IT ALSO CALLS FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE MIND'S FUNCTIONING GENERALLY AND HOW IT PROCESSES INFORMATION IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING, LINKING THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS AS WELL AS FACTS AND FICTIONS. BASED ON THE QUALIFICATION OF "FAKE NEWS" AS AN OXYMORON, THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE DEFICIENCIES IN A DICHOTOMOUS DISTINCTION BETWEEN FACT AND FICTION EXEMPLIFIED BY INFORMATION ABOUT THE PANDEMIC OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IN AN ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR A GLOBAL REGULATORY DEBATE REGARDING "FAKE NEWS".
773	AT THE CENTER OF CONTEMPORARY DEBATES OVER PUBLIC LAW LIES ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES' DISCRETION TO IMPOSE RULES. YET FOR EVERY ONE OF THESE RULES, THERE ARE ALSO UNRULES NEARBY. OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND SOMETIMES BARELY VISIBLE, UNRULES ARE THE DECISIONS THAT REGULATORS MAKE TO LIFT OR LIMIT THE SCOPE OF A REGULATORY OBLIGATION THROUGH, FOR INSTANCE, WAIVERS, EXEMPTIONS, OR EXCEPTIONS. IN SOME CASES, UNRULES ENABLE REGULATORS TO REDUCE BURDENS ON REGULATED ENTITIES OR TO CONSERVE VALUABLE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES IN WAYS THAT MAKE LAW MORE EFFICIENT. HOWEVER, TOO MUCH DISCRETION TO CREATE UNRULES CAN FACILITATE UNDUE BUSINESS INFLUENCE OVER THE LAW, WEAKEN REGULATORY SCHEMES, AND EVEN UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CONDUCT THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE HIDDEN WORLD OF UNRULES. USING A COMPUTATIONAL-LINGUISTIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY UNRULES ACROSS THE FEDERAL REGISTER, THE CODE OFFEDERAL REGULATIONS, AND THE UNITED STATES CODE, WE SHOW THAT UNRULES ARE AN INTEGRAL AND SUBSTANTIAL FEATURE OF THE FEDERAL REGULATORY SYSTEM. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT, BY SEVERAL CONSERVATIVE MEASURES, THERE EXISTS ONE OBLIGATION-ALLEVIATING WORD FOR APPROXIMATELY EVERY FIVE TO SIX OBLIGATION-IMPOSING WORDS IN FEDERAL LAW. WE ALSO SHOW THAT UNRULES ARE SURPRISINGLY UNRESTRAINED BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IN STARK CONTRAST TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'S TREATMENT OF OBLIGATION-IMPOSING RULES, REGULATORS ENJOY GREATER DISCRETION WHEN DEPLOYING UNRULES TO ALLEVIATE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, A MAJOR FORM OF AGENCY POWER REMAINS HIDDEN FROM VIEW AND RELATIVELY UNENCUMBERED BY LAW. RECOGNIZING THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT UNRULES PLAY IN OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM REVEALS THE NEED TO REORIENT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND INCORPORATE UNRULES MORE EXPLICITLY INTO ITS ASSUMPTIONS, DOCTRINES, AND PROCEDURES.
774	THIS CONTRIBUTION ANALYSES VARIOUS ISSUES ARISING FROM THE JUDICIAL REVIEW EXERCISED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN PARTICULAR THE GENERAL COURT, IN RELATION TO RESTRICTIVE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF ITS COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE REQUIREMENTS STEMMING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW (ARTICLE 2 TEU) AND THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION (ARTICLE 47 OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EU), THE COURT'S CASE LAW HAS ACCEPTED, FIRSTLY, THAT PRELIMINARY RULINGS AND ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN THIS FIELD, IN ADDITION TO THE MAIN PROCEDURAL INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED FOR BY THE FOUNDING TREATIES (ACTIONS FOR ANNULMENT AND OBJECTIONS OF ILLEGALITY). SECONDLY, CASE LAW HAS REQUIRED THAT THE BASIC PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES BE RESPECTED, IN PARTICULAR THE REQUIREMENT OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PECULIARITIES OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION ENJOYED BY THE COUNCIL, THE CASE LAW HAS ALSO RECOGNISED THE EXISTENCE OF MATERIAL AND PROCEDURAL PARTICULARITIES IN THE REVIEW OF LEGALITY EXERCISED BY THE COURT. IN ANY EVENT, THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENCE (ENTITLEMENT TO DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE, ACCESS TO THE FILE, THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND THE RIGHT TO PERIODIC REVIEW) PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE REVIEW OF THE LEGALITY OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES. IN SHORT, THIS IS A COMPLEX MATTER IN WHICH CASE LAW SEEKS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE UNION'S COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY, AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE FOUNDING TREATIES, AND THE REQUIREMENT FOR LEGALITY OF THE MEASURES.
775	THIS RESEARCH CENTERS ON THE CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THE DEATH PENALTY AS EXPRESSED IN LAW AND PRACTICE THROUGHOUT VIETNAM'S HISTORY WITH A FOCUS ON MODERN TIME. USING A SET OF TYPICAL LEGAL RESEARCH METHODS, IN PARTICULAR, LEGAL HISTORY, DOCTRINAL RESEARCH, PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND, SOCIOLOGY OF LAW, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CHANGE AND REFORM OF CAPITAL OFFENCES IN VIETNAMESE LAWS. IT IS REVEALED THROUGH OUR RESEARCH THAT THE NATURE OF THE DEATH PENALTY HAS BEEN FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER AND COERCION DURING MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY TO A MANIFESTATION OF JUSTICE BASED ON THE IDEAS OF RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS THAT STARTED TO EMERGE IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, ESPECIALLY FROM 1986 ONWARDS. AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF CAPITAL OFFENCES HAS BEEN GRADUALLY REDUCED IN THREE MODERN CRIMINAL CODES. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT THE NUMBER OF CAPITAL SENTENCES AND EXECUTIONS APPEARS TO REMAIN UNCHANGED, EVEN SLIGHTLY INCREASED. THIS CREATES A PARADOX THAT OPENS AND INVITES A FUTURE, INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE ALSO ARGUES THAT AS THE DEATH PENALTY FINDS ITS MORAL AND LEGAL JUSTIFICATIONS ALONG WITH THE RISE OF THE NUMBER OF DEATH SENTENCES GIVEN TO MANY SERIOUS CRIMINAL CASES, THE DEATH PENALTY APPEARS TO FIND SUPPORT AMONG THE PUBLIC. IN ADDITION, THE POLITICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE ISSUE, AS EXPRESSED THROUGH THE PROHIBITION ON THE DISCLOSURE OF THE DEATH PENALTY DATA, WILL INHIBIT DISCOURSE ON THE PROBLEM. TOGETHER, THEY WILL MAINTAIN THE EXISTENCE AND APPLICATION OF THE DEATH PENALTY IN VIETNAM IN THE TIME TO COME.
776	INTRODUCTION: THE RIGHT TO ACCESS INFORMATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, PROTECTED BY MOST CONSTITUTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. NATIONAL LEGISLATION REGULATES THIS RIGHT. OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYZE THE STATE OF THE ART IN LEGISLATIVE MATTERS TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN LATIN AMERICA BASED ON THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF THREE OF THE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. SCIENTIFIC METHODS: MAIN METHOD OF COMPARATIVE LAW, ALTHOUGH METHODS SUCH AS EMPIRICAL-LOGICAL, DEDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE METHODS ALSO UNDERLIE THEM, IN ADDITION TO THE OBSERVATION TECHNIQUE OF DOCUMENT ANALYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION IS A RIGHT RECOGNIZED BY NATIONAL LEGISLATION, ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THE RULE OF LAW AND IS ASSUMED TO BE IMPORTANT FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THOUGHT IN KNOWLEDGE SOCIETIES. IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF LATIN AMERICA THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT REGULATE ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION. THESE ARE REGULATING EVERYTHING FROM THE DUTY OF THE STATE AND CITIZENS TO THE PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THIS RIGHT. THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF MEXICO, EL SALVADOR AND URUGUAY ALLOWS US TO REALIZE THE PREVAILING LEGAL TREATMENT IN CORE ASPECTS OF THE TOPIC. ASPECTS SUCH AS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROVISIONS, THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES STAND OUT FOR THEIR SIMILARITY AND ADHERENCE TO THE OBJECTIVE OF SUCH REGULATIONS. THERE IS CONSENSUS IN THE REGION ON THE CREATION OF BODIES SEPARATE FROM OTHER STATE STRUCTURES TO CONTROL AND GUARANTEE ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION. ESTABLISHING FUNCTIONS FROM THE LAW GUARANTEES THE FULFILLMENT OF THESE FUNCTIONS. THERE IS A DOCTRINAL AND LEGISLATIVE CONSENSUS EVIDENCED IN THE COMPARATIVE STATES THAT EXIST IN THE LATIN AMERICAN AREA REGARDING THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF LATIN AMERICA. THIS BECOMES ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THIS
777	BASED ON A GENEALOGY OF THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY, THE GOAL OF THE PAPER IS TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL THAT UNITES NORMATIVE-THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES AND HENCE RECONCILES TWO DIFFERENT CONCEPTUAL-THEORETICAL CAMPS IN LEGITIMACY RESEARCH. LEGITIMACY IS A CORE CONCEPT IN POLITICAL SCIENCE THAT RELATES TO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS OF POLITICS, POLITY AND POLICY-THE RELATION BETWEEN RULERS AND RULED, THE PROPERTIES OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM, ITS DEMOCRATIC QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND ITS POLICY OUTPUT. HOWEVER, IN ACADEMIA, NO CONSENSUS HAS EVOLVED ON THE CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL CORE OF LEGITIMACY, IT IS STILL ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED. ONE MAIN REASON FOR THIS IS THAT A CONCEPT SUCH AS LEGITIMACY IS NOT ONLY A TOOL FOR ANALYSIS, BUT CAN ALSO BECOME AN OBJECT OF ACADEMIC CONTROVERSY ITSELF, AS RESEARCHERS GIVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO CONCEPTUALIZING IT. THIS IS WHY ACADEMIC CONTROVERSIES ON A CONCEPT HIGHLIGHT KEY ISSUES, QUESTIONS AND DIMENSIONS OF UNDERSTANDING, DEFINING, AND OPERATIONALISING IT-WHICH IS ALSO THE CASE FOR LEGITIMACY. THE PAPER THEREFORE RECOLLECTS THE MAIN CONTROVERSIES AROUND THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY SINCE THE 1950'S BY TRACING A GENEALOGY OF LEGITIMACY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. A GENEALOGY IS A METHODOLOGICAL TOOL IN INTELLECTUAL AND CONCEPTUAL HISTORY. DIFFERENT FROM A CLASSICAL LITERATURE REVIEW, A GENEALOGY SUMMARIZES THE MAIN LINES AND TRADITIONS OF THINKING ON A CONCEPT, THE KEY CONTROVERSIES, PREDOMINANT UNDERSTANDINGS, AND CRUCIAL ISSUES OF CONCEPTUALIZING IT. IN THE CONCEPTUAL DEBATES ON LEGITIMACY IN POLITICAL SCIENCE, THE CORE CONTROVERSY IS THE ONE BETWEEN NORMATIVE-THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES. BASED ON THE GENEALOGY, WE DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR CONCEPTUALIZING LEGITIMACY THAT ENABLES TO RECONCILE THE NORMATIVE-THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL CAMPS IN LEGITIMACY RESEARCH.
778	THE EUROPEAN FINANCIAL REGULATION IS EVOLVING WITH NEW AND SPECIFIC FORMS OF COOPERATION FOR THE MEMBER STATES, ENHANCING CONCEPTS AND INNOVATIVE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY FEATURING THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF HARMONIZATION. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EUROPEAN DEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN LAW DEVELOPMENT, IN REPLY TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FREE MARKET. THE METHODS OF RESEARCH INCLUDE A THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE, A COMPARISON OF THE PROPOSED REGULATION AND REGULATION IN FORCE, SYNTHESIS, AND DEDUCTION. THE RESEARCH RESULTS ARE BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF NEGOTIATION IN BUILDING EFFICIENT MECHANISMS TO STIMULATE MONEY SAVING CONDUCT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL PERSONS, GLOBALLY AND WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. ACKNOWLEDGING THE STATUS OF THE THREE PILLARS OF THE EUROPEAN BANKING UNION LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE, THE MEMBER STATES HAVE UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE DIRECTIVE FROM 2014 NEEDED A BRACING APPROACH, TO ENSURE MORE PROTECTION AND TO SUPPORT ENHANCED FINANCIAL INTEGRATION. THE ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EUROPEAN DEPOSIT INSURANCE SCHEME IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRESENT GLOBAL CHALLENGES. THE MONEY SAVING CONDUCT WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE REGULATION FOR THE DEPOSIT GUARANTEE MECHANISM, WHILE THE TIGHT ESTIMATED AGENDA FOR THE FINAL REGULATORY PROPOSAL ASKS FOR INGENIOUS COOPERATION TO REACH A CONSENSUS WITHIN MEMBERS STATES. THE RESEARCH SHOWED THE IMPERATIVE TO BUILD COMMON LEGISLATION FOR THE MEMBER STATES AND A FUTURE DIRECTION OF INVESTIGATION TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE DOMESTIC REGULATION AND MILESTONE GENERATED BY THE EUROPEAN DIRECTIVES IN EACH STATE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.
779	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR STUDYING THE SOCIAL CONTRACT ALONG THE FOUR PARAMETERS (4PS) OF PRO-TECTION, PROVISION, PARTICIPATION AND THE PRODUCTION OF HEGEMONY. TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENTIATED EXPERIENCE OF HOW THESE PARAMETERS ARE LIVED, THIS FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO SCHOOLS AS ARENAS THAT UNIQUELY CAPTURE THE DYNAMICS OF POWER AND LEGITIMACY IN SOCIETY. THE EDUCATION SECTOR REFLECTS BROADER TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE STATE BUREAUCRACY, IN SOCIAL POLICY AND IN THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF KEY ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT FROM THE RULE OF LAW AND GENDERED VIOLENCE TO FORMAL AND INFORMAL PRIVATIZATION, EVERYDAY FORMS OF PARTICIPATION AND THE NARRATIVES AND PRACTICES AROUND NATIONALISM AND NEOLIBERALISM THAT LEGITIMIZE THESE CHANGES. APPLYING THIS APPROACH TO THE CASE STUDY OF EGYPT UPDATES EARLIER PROPOSITIONS ABOUT AN ARAB SOCIAL CONTRACT AND NUANCES THE NOTION OF A TRADEOFF BETWEEN PROVISION AND PARTICIPATION RIGHTS IN UNDERSTANDING REGIME LEGITIMACY. IT UNDERLINES THE CRITICAL CHANGES TO PROTECTION AND LEGITIMATION OVER THE PAST DECADES AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE OUTSOURCING OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT TO MARKET, CHARITABLE AND RELIGIOUS FORCES. DRAWING ON RARE RESEARCH INSIDE SCHOOLS CATERING TO DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES BEFORE AND AFTER THE 2011 UPRISING, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW THEIR REALITIES REFLECT THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF LIVED CITIZENSHIP IN THIS HISTORICAL JUNCTURE. EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS REVEAL A 'LIVED SOCIAL CONTRACT' THAT IS UNDERPINNED BY SELECTIVE RETRACTION OF PROTECTION, A COLLAPSE OF PROVISION, IMPOVERISHMENT AND ISLAMIZATION OF PARTICIPATION AND A RESULTING DISENGAGEMENT FROM THE PRODUCTION OF HEGEMONY.

780	SINCE INDEPENDENCE, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICAN STATES IN RESPECT TO THE PREVALENCE OF DEMOCRACY, RECOGNITION OF THE RULE OF LAW, REDUCTION IN UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENTS, REGULAR, TRANSPARENT, FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, AND A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR DOING BUSINESS. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A RANGE OF CONSOLIDATING INDICATORS THAT CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE AFRICAN STATE IN LIGHT OF THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE (ACDEG). CONSOLIDATION INDICATORS EXAMINED INCLUDE THE LEVEL OF INTERNAL INTEGRATION/DISINTEGRATION OF THE STATE, THE DEGREE AND NATURE OF PEACE, THE NATURE OF DEMOCRACY AND ELECTIONS AND OF GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS, LEVELS OF CAPACITY, THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF THE STATE AS WELL AS ISSUES CONCERNING WOMEN AND YOUTH. THE USE OF CONSOLIDATION INDICATORS IS A NEW EFFORT TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF CONTINGENCY AND PREVENTIVE PLANNING, WITH THE AIM OF HAVING MORE PEACEFUL AND PROGRESSIVE AFRICAN STATES. CHARACTERISING AFRICAN STATES, BASED ON VARIOUS CONSOLIDATION INDICATORS, IS AN IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT ENDEAVOUR, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE CONCEPT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE AFRICAN STATE IS UNDER-RESEARCHED, WITH A PAUCITY OF A CLEAR ASSESSMENT. THE DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACDEG AND NOTES THE INCREASING RECOGNITION BY AFRICAN STATES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PRACTICES TO THE CONTINENT. UNDERSTANDING THE PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES OF CONSOLIDATING THE AFRICAN STATE WILL HELP POLICY MAKERS TO STRENGTHEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACDEG, IN PUSHING AFRICAN STATES TOWARDS REALISING THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) AFRICA AGENDA 2063. THIS ARTICLE TAKES AN AFROCENTRIC APPROACH BY DISCUSSING THE POSITIVE ROLE OF REGIONAL AND CONTINENTAL INSTITUTIONS IN PROMOTING AND STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA.
781	ACCOUNTABILITY HAS BECOME A CORNERSTONE OF CURRENT DISCUSSION ON THE PROSPECTS OF LEGITIMATE AND EFFECTIVE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. IN SPITE OF ITS RATHER HIGH CURRENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY DOES NOT PARTAKE IN THE SELECT GROUP OF FIRST-ORDER POLITICAL IDEALS: DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW HAVE ALL BEEN HISTORICALLY UTTERED IN MUCH MORE VOCAL TONES AND STILL REMAIN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PUBLIC DEMANDS FOR LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY. RATHER THAN RADIATING A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL OR POLITICAL VISION, ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLIES A POWER-CONSTRAINING TOOLBOX THAT ALLOWS FOR A VARIETY OF MORE OR LESS ATTRACTIVE PERMUTATIONS. THIS RATHER COMMONPLACE STORY, THOUGH, TELLS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE CONCRETE CONFIGURATIONS, UNDERLYING VALUES AND ENDS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CONCEPT OF ACCOUNTABILITY REMAINS UNSTABLE BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS DESCRIPTIVE AND NORMATIVE ASPECTS LACK A CLEARER ARTICULATION; TRADITIONAL TAXONOMIES FAIL TO PRECISELY ILLUMINATE ITS POLITICAL AND EXTRA-POLITICAL INSTANTIATIONS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONNECTION WITH LAW; THE RELEVANT DESCRIPTIVE VARIABLES THAT SHAPE ACCOUNTABILITY ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT YET SYSTEMATIZED IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY; THE SPECIFIC NORMATIVE GOALS THAT LURK BEHIND THE CALLS FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY TEND TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, AND THE TRADE-OFFS OR INTERNAL TENSIONS THAT NECESSARILY OCCUR ARE USUALLY CAMOUFLAGED. CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATION, THUS, IS INDISPENSABLE WHENEVER ONE COMES ACROSS SUCH MULTIFACETED UMBRELLA TERMS. THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO DIAGNOSE SUCH SHORTCOMINGS, TO ELUCIDATE A MINIMALIST CONCEPT OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO PROVIDE A LARGE ANALYTICAL MAP THAT CAN AID BOTH THE DESCRIPTION AND THE CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARRANGEMENTS IN LIGHT OF THEIR POTENTIAL PURPOSES. THIS ANALYTICAL EXERCISE IS A PIVOTAL STARTING POINT IF ACCOUNTABILITY IS TO GET A BETTER GRIP ON THE DEBATES ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.
782	MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS ARE TYPICALLY DISMISSED AS LOW-LEVEL EVENTS THAT DO NOT DESERVE THE ATTENTION OR DUE PROCESS ACCORDED TO FELONIES. AND YET, TEN MILLION PETTY CASES ARE FILED EVERY YEAR, AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF U.S. CONVICTIONS ARE MISDEMEANORS. IN COMPARISON TO FELONY ADJUDICATION, MISDEMEANOR PROCESSING IS LARGELY INFORMAL AND DEREGULATED, CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH-VOLUME ARRESTS, WEAK PROSECUTORIAL SCREENING, AN IMPOVERISHED DEFENSE BAR, AND HIGH PLEA RATES. TOGETHER, THESE CHARACTERISTICS GENERATE CONVICTIONS IN BULK, OFTEN WITHOUT MEANINGFUL SCRUTINY OF WHETHER THOSE CONVICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. INDEED, INNOCENT MISDEMEANANTS ROUTINELY PLEAD GUILTY TO GET OUT OF JAIL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD BAIL. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CONVICTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT: IN ADDITION TO THE STIGMA OF A CRIMINAL RECORD, MISDEMEANANTS ARE OFTEN HEAVILY FINED OR INCARCERATED, AND CAN LOSE JOBS, HOUSING, OR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, PETTY CONVICTIONS ARE GROWING MORE FREQUENT AND BURDENSOME EVEN AS WE DEVOTE FEWER INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURING THEIR VALIDITY. THE MISDEMEANOR PHENOMENON HAS PROFOUND SYSTEMIC IMPLICATIONS. IT INVITES SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL MISDEMEANANTS ARE ACTUALLY GUILTY. IT REVEALS AN IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL FEATURE OF THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM: THAT DUE PROCESS AND RULE OF LAW WANE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PENAL PYRAMID WHERE OFFENSES ARE PETTIEST AND DEFENDANTS ARE POOREST. AND IT IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN THE RACIALIZATION OF CRIME, BECAUSE MISDEMEANOR PROCESSING IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH POOR DEFENDANTS OF COLOR ARE SWEPT UP INTO THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM (IN OTHER WORDS, CRIMINALIZED) WITH LITTLE OR NO REGARD FOR THEIR ACTUAL GUILT. IN SUM, THE MISDEMEANOR PROCESS IS AN INSTITUTIONAL GATEWAY THAT EXPLAINS MANY OF THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM'S DYNAMICS AND DYSFUNCTIONS.
783	COURTS CAN HOLD A STATUTE UNCONSTITUTIONAL EITHER ON ITS FACE OR IS-APPLIED, AND THE STANDARDS COURTS USE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE. IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR DORF ANALYZES THE SUPREME COURT'S FACIAL CHALLENGE DOCTRINE, WHICH PURPORTS TO RESTRICT FACIAL CHALLENGES TO THOSE CASES IN WHICH A STATUTE CAN BE CONSTITUTIONALLY APPLIED IN ''NO SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.'' PROFESSOR DORF ARGUES FIRST THAT ALL PERSONS HAVE A RIGHT TO BE JUDGED BY A VALID RULE OF LAW, AND THAT THE COURT'S CURRENT FACIAL CHALLENGE DOCTRINE CAN ONLY BE SQUARED WITH THIS RIGHT IF THE COURT IS EMPLOYING A PRESUMPTION OF SEVERABILITY-THAT UNCONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF A STATUTE CAN BE SEVERED FROM CONSTITUTIONAL ONES BY A PROCESS OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION PROFESSOR DORF THEN DISCUSSES THE LIMITS IMPOSED ON THIS PRESUMPTION OF SEVERABILITY BY BOTH SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS. IN ANALYZING THE FORMER, HE ARGUES THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT OVERBREADTH DOCTRINE WHICH THE COURT HAS RECOGNIZED LIMITS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ''NO SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES'' TEST, SHOULD BE AND IN FACT HAS BEEN APPLIED OUTSIDE THE FIRST AMENDMENT CONTEXT IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THE FACIAL CHALLENGE RULE. HE ALSO ARGUES THAT THE FACIAL CHALLENGE RULE IS INCONSISTENT WITH PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM, AS IT PREVENTS FEDERAL COURTS FROM GIVING PROPER DEFERENCE TO STATE COURTS ON ISSUES OF STATE LAW. PROFESSOR DORF CONCLUDES THAT THE COURT'S ''NO SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES '' TEST DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE COURT'S FACIAL CHALLENGE DOCTRINE, AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE COURT ESCHEW CATEGORIZING CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES AS EITHER FACIAL OR AS-APPLIED, FOCUSING INSTEAD ON THE UNDERLYING SUBSTANTIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.
784	REPUBLICANISM AND LIBERALISM ARE DEPICTED HERE, UNDER SOME IDEAL-TYPING OF THE TRADITIONS, AS PHILOSOPHIES OF LIBERTY-NEGATIVE LIBERTY-THAT TAKE OPPOSITE SIDES ON BROAD ISSUES: 1) WHETHER THE LAW IS NECESSARILY A PARTIAL ASSAULT ON PEOPLE'S LIBERTY-AN ASSAULT THAT MAY BE FOR THE GOOD OVERALL-OR SOMETHING THAT IS CONSTITUTIVE, AT LEAST IN PART, OF WHATEVER LIBERTY CITIZENS ENJOY; 2) WHETHER OR NOT CITIZENS AND POLITICIANS CAN AND SHOULD BE EXPECTED-PERHAPS UNDER INSTITUTIONALLY DESIGNED PRESSURES-TO BE PUBLIC-SPIRITED; AND 3) WHETHER THE IDEAL OF LIBERTY INVITES STATE INTERVENTION OF THE SORT THAT IS DESIGNED TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS OR WHETHER IT IS ESSENTIALLY TIED TO A MINIMALIST IMAGE OF GOVERNMENT. REPUBLICANISM SEES LIBERTY AS THE SOCIAL STATUS OF A CITIZEN WHO IS RECOGNISED AND EMPOWERED, EQUALLY WITH OTHERS, BEFORE A SUITABLE RULE OF LAW; IT SEES LIBERTY AS A STATUS THAT IS SECURE ONLY SO FAR AS THE REPUBLIC IS PEOPLED AND RUN BY INDIVIDUALS WHO DISPLAY CIVIC VIRTUE, WHETHER SPONTANEOUSLY OR UNDER WELL DESIGNED INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES; AND, FINALLY, IT SEES THE DISPENSATION OF LIBERTY AS SOMETHING THAT MAY IN PRINCIPLE REQUIRE A LARGE STATE PRESENCE IN AREAS LIKE EDUCATION, MEDICINE, AND SOCIAL SECURITY. LIBERALISM, AT LEAST IN ITS PURE FORM, PRESENTS LIBERTY AS A CONDITION IDEALLY ENJOYED, OUT OF SOCIETY, WHEN THERE IS NO ONE ELSE AROUND; IT HOLDS THAT, GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF INVISIBLE HAND MECHANISMS, CITIZENS AND POLITICIANS NEED NOT BE PUBLIC-SPIRITED FOR LIBERTY TO THRIVE; AND IT INTERPRETS THE DEMANDS OF LIBERTY IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS A MINIMALIST ASSUMPTION ABOUT HOW GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BEHAVE.
785	GIVEN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC CORONAVIRUS, THE PAPER ANALYZES THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE DISEASE CAUSED BY THE VIRUS (COVID-19) FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TWO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES I.E. THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE STATES' RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC FROM HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE. THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED INTO THE PATTERNS OF THEIR "STRUGGLE", ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE HUMAN RIGHTS RESTRICTIONS THEY HAD OPTED FOR WITHIN THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE STARTING POINT OF THE PAPER WAS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS OFTEN ARE THE VICTIMS OF THE CRISES AND THAT THEY ARE EASILY RESTRICTED FOR A LONGER PERIODS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE AUTHOR DEALS WITH POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY AND CONTENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND HOW THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS ENSURED IN THESE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS LEGAL FRAMEWORK WAS LINKED TO CURRENT STATISTICS ON THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES. HAVING ANALYZED THE RESPONSE OF THE TWO STATES, IT COULD BE NOTED THAT BOTH STATES HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, ALLOWING THEM THE RULE OF LAW IN THESE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BOTH CONSTITUTIONS RECOGNIZE A LIST OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT MAY BE DEROGATED IN STATE OF EMERGENCY. HOWEVER, IN CROATIA, THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS NOT INTRODUCED, AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS WERE RESTRICTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GIVEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION. IN SERBIA, THE STRUGGLE AGAINST COVID-19 TOOK PLACE IN STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WAS MARKED BY AN EXTREMELY RESTRICTIVE REGIME OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH WAS PARTLY IN CONFLICT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPT OF ABSOLUTE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, IN THEIR BROADEST SENSE, HAD PROVED UNSUSTAINABLE IN PRACTICE.
786	THE PAPER REVEALS THE POTENTIAL OF PROVISIONS ON ECOLOGY FROM THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTION, ROLE OF THE RELEVANT FEDERAL LEGISLATION PROVIDING FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CITIZENS, STATE AND SOCIETY FOR MAINTAINING ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE, STATE AND MUNICIPAL TITLES TO LAND AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN A CERTAIN TERRITORY. THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTION IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANALYZE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS PROVISIONS CONCERNING ECOLOGY. THE ARTICLE COMPARES SUBJECTS OF REGULATION AND DIFFERENT LEGISLATIONS IN PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL, URBAN DEVELOPMENT, LAND, WATER, FOREST, HEALTH, RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS TO FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT, RELIABLE INFORMATION ON ITS CONDITION INDEMNIFICATION FOR HARM TO HEALTH OR PROPERTY. THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE APPLIED TO ESTABLISH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FEDERAL POLICY ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, COOPERATIVE LAWMAKING ACTIVITY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND ITS SUBJECTS IN THE AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, PROTECTION AND SECURITY. THE ATTEMPTS TO REVEAL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS THEREOF SHOW THE NECESSITY TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL MECHANISM OF APPLYING, MODERNIZING STATE, INDUSTRIAL AND PUBLIC CONTROL (SUPERVISION) OF JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY, ENSURE INEVITABILITY OF LEGAL PROSECUTION FOR NATURAL AND LEGAL PERSONS LIABLE FOR THE ABUSE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND OBJECTS. IT IS CONTROVERSIAL TO STATE THAT ALL THE CURRENT NORMS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTION ARE DULY AND COMPLETELY IMPLEMENTED. HENCE, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT IT IS VIABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON IMPLEMENTING THE NORMS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO OUTLINE THE PROBLEMS AND GUIDELINES FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SYSTEM.
787	OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION UTILIZES EXPEDITIONS AND EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL GROWTH. HOWEVER, BY SELLING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADVENTURE AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS UNKNOWINGLY ENTANGLE THE FIELD WITH NEOLIBERAL IDEOLOGIES. NEOLIBERALISM IS A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IDEOLOGY THAT PROMOTES DECENTRALIZATION OF GOVERNANCE, THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND A FREE MARKET. DESPITE ITS PREVALENCE IN THE LITERATURE OF RELATED FIELDS, OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION SCHOLARS SELDOMLY ADDRESS NEOLIBERALISM, ESPECIALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE FIELD'S SOCIAL JUSTICE EFFORTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE HOW OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION'S SUBSCRIPTION TO NEOLIBERAL PRINCIPLES, MOST NOTABLY INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND THE FREE MARKET, INHIBITS THE FIELD'S ATTEMPTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIAL JUSTICE. SOCIAL JUSTICE IS A PROCESS THAT SEEKS TO UNEARTH THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEMIC ROOTS OF INJUSTICE TO WORK TOWARD GREATER SOCIAL EQUITY. INSTITUTIONS WORKING TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE MUST DISENTANGLE FROM ELEMENTS OF A DOMINATING NEOLIBERAL SYSTEM THAT ACTIVELY PERPETUATES SOCIAL INEQUITIES. BY UNDERSTANDING NEOLIBERALISM'S INFLUENCE, THE OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION FIELD CAN BECOME A LEADER FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE BY IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEMS, AND SUBSEQUENT INEQUITIES, ASSOCIATED WITH NEOLIBERALISM. HOWEVER, IF OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION HOPES TO PROGRESS BEYOND THE OPPRESSIVE STRUCTURES IMPOSED BY NEOLIBERAL IDEOLOGIES, WE ARGUE THAT THE FIELD NEEDS TO CRITIQUE ITS CURRENT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICES. OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS MUST EMBRACE THEIR ROLE IN DEVELOPING CITIZENS FOR A MORE JUST SOCIETY BY TAKING SYSTEMATIC AND COLLECTIVE ACTION. IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE A TANGIBLE CONTRIBUTION, WE OFFER POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF NEOLIBERALISM AND ADVANCING SOCIAL JUSTICE EFFORTS IN OUTDOOR ADVENTURE EDUCATION.
788	THIS PAPER INTERROGATES THE PREDISPOSITION IN FAVOUR OF INFORMAL, LOW-INTERVENTION CONTROL STYLES OF ENFORCEMENT ADVOCATED BY THE 'BETTER REGULATION' MOVEMENT, AND WHICH RESONATES THROUGHOUT THE HAMPTON REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE UK. IT FOCUSES ON THREE PRACTICES THAT REFLECT THE TREND TOWARDS DIVERTING REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACTION AWAY FROM THE COURTS IN FAVOUR OF RELIANCE ON FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONING POWERS RANGING FROM 'HARD' TO 'SOFT': THE USE OF NEGOTIATED PENALTY SETTLEMENTS, THE ACCEPTANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE UNDERTAKINGS ('ENFORCEMENT UNDERTAKINGS') AND THE PROVISION OF FIRM-SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE ADVICE BY REGULATORS. EACH PRACTICE IS EXPLORED THROUGH VARIOUS ANALYTICAL LENSES WHICH ENABLE THE UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL TENSIONS TO BE IDENTIFIED AND INTERROGATED. IN SO DOING, IT DEMONSTRATES HOW THE EMPHASIS ON BARGAINING, NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN REGULATORS AND THOSE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING ADVOCATED BY THE UK BETTER REGULATION MOVEMENT MAY ANTAGONISE SEVERAL CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES, INCLUDING TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, DUE PROCESS AND PARTICIPATION, AS WELL AS SEVERAL VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH FORMAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, RESORT TO NEGOTIATION AND DISCUSSION IN REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT CAN GENERATE IMPORTANT BENEFITS, LARGELY IN FACILITATING THE TIMELY, CREATIVE AND COST-EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF ENFORCEMENT DISPUTES WHILE AVOIDING THE FORMALITY, DELAY AND HOSTILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FORMAL COURT ADJUDICATION. THIS 'CLASH OF LOGICS' CAN BE TRACED TO INHERENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BARGAINING, ON THE ONE HAND, AND ADJUDICATION ON THE OTHER. BARGAINING AND ADJUDICATION REPRESENT TWO QUITE DIFFERENT AND DISTINCT FORMS OF ORDERING THROUGH WHICH DISPUTES CAN BE RESOLVED, AND IT IS THESE DIFFERENCES THAT LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE VIRTUES AND SHORTCOMINGS WHEN EMPLOYED TO RESOLVE DISPUTES CONCERNING REGULATORY VIOLATIONS.
789	THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY OR OF ABSTRACTION USED TO DESCRIBE A PRECEDENT, A RIGHT, OR THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND A STATUTORY PROVISION OR CONSTITUENT PURPOSE BEHIND A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION CAN HAVE A DECISIVE IMPACT ON THE OUTCOME OF A CASE. CHARACTERISING IT IN NARROW TERMS HAS THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE SCOPE OF DECISION OF A JUDGMENT; CONVERSELY, A BROADER CHARACTERISATION PROVIDES MORE LEEWAY FOR A JUDGE IN A CASE TO ENCOMPASS ITS FACTS WITHIN THE PRECEDENT, RIGHT OR PURPOSE IN ISSUE. THE ISSUE RAISED BY THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY PROBLEM IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH COURTS HAVE A DISCRETION OR FREEDOM OF MANOEUVRE AS TO THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY THEY DECIDE UPON, AND THUS WHETHER GENERALITY AND ABSTRACTION ARE MANIPULABLE IN THE HANDS OF JUDGES AND ARE NOT REALLY PREDETERMINED BY THE LEGAL SOURCES IN QUESTION OR AN ESTABLISHED JUDICIAL METHOD OF INTERPRETATION. UNCONTROLLED JUDICIAL DISCRETION OF THIS KIND IS PROBLEMATIC FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, ESPECIALLY WHEN ADJUDICATION CONCERNS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, THE EQUIVALENT IN THE EU BEING INTERPRETATION BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) OF THE EU TREATIES; REVERSAL OF ECJ INTERPRETATION THROUGH TREATY AMENDMENT IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES UNANIMOUS COORDINATION BY THE MEMBER STATES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TWO ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DETERMINING THE CORRECT OR APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF GENERALITY ISSUE IN ECJ INTERPETATION, COHERENCE OR THE LEGAL TRADITIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES, AND ARGUES IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER AS A LESS SUBJECTIVE METHOD. APPLICATION OF THE TWO ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IS TESTED IN TWO AREAS OF EU LAW, STATE LIABILITY AND CRIMINAL LAW.
790	WHILE THE JUDICIARY IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE DEFENDER OF THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON THAT JUDGES COULD ALSO SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC VALUES. COURTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE LEGITIMISED UNDEMOCRATIC OR EVEN REPRESSIVE LAW AND PRACTICES. AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TEND TO CAPTURE THE JUDICIARY, NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE JUDICIARY WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGITIMACY FOR ANTI-DEMOCRATIC MEASURES, BUT THE NATURE OF THE INSTITUTION COULD ALSO MASQUERADE SUCH MEASURES AS A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF POWER THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE JUDICIARY OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (HKSAR). IT FOCUSES ON THE JUDICIAL RESPONSES WHEN THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO SHIFT THE EMPHASIS FROM "TWO SYSTEMS " TO "ONE COUNTRY " UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF THE HKSAR AND TO EXERCISE "FULL JURISDICTION " OVER HONG KONG. BY FOCUSING ON THE REASONING AND THE CONTEXT OF THE RELEVANT CASES, IT ARGUES THAT THE RESPONSES OF THE JUDICIARY AMOUNT TO A WEAK FORM OF "ABUSIVE JUDICIAL REVIEW ". THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL OF "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS " IMPLIES MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION OF THE TWO SYSTEMS, AND CONVERGENCE MEANS RECONCILIATION OF THE TWO SYSTEMS RATHER THAN CHANGING ONE SYSTEM TO CONFORM WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM. WHILE THERE ARE INCIDENTS SUGGESTING A STRONG FORM OF "ABUSIVE JUDICIAL REVIEW ", IT IS ARGUED THAT IT IS TOO EARLY TO DRAW THIS CONCLUSION. THE ARTICLE ALSO CAUTIONS THAT WHEN THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER, IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE JUDICIARY TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE TAPESTRY OF COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES TO STRIKE A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND PROTECTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY.
791	THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE PRODUCT OF STATUTES, JUDICIAL DOCTRINES, AND AGENCY PRACTICES RATHER THAN CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT. IN RECENT YEARS, HOWEVER, FEDERAL COURTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONFRONT IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT'S EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION UNDER BROADLY WORDED FEDERAL STATUTES. AMONG THOSE QUESTIONS: (1) DOES THE CONSTITUTION IMPOSE ANY INDEPENDENT CONSTRAINTS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PRESIDENT UNDER THE TEXT OF FEDERAL STATUTES? (2) IF SO, ARE JUDGES OBLIGED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT DISCRETION HAS BEEN ABUSED? AND (3) HOW SHOULD JUDGES MAKE SUCH DETERMINATIONS? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE TAKE CARE CLAUSE OF ARTICLE II, SECTION 3 CONSTRAINS THE PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AND THAT JUDGES ARE OBLIGED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT DISCRETION HAS BEEN "FAITHFULLY" EXERCISED. IT THEN CONSTRUCTS A FAITHFUL EXECUTION FRAMEWORK THAT JUDGES CAN USE TO IMPLEMENT THE "LETTER"-THE TEXT-AND THE "SPIRIT"-THE FUNCTIONS-OF THE TAKE CARE CLAUSE. TO THAT END, IT MAKES USE OF A THEORY OF FIDUCIARY GOVERNMENT THAT INFORMED THE CONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF THE TAKE CARE CLAUSE AND DRAWS UPON WELL-ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DOCTRINES. IT USES THE FAITHFUL EXECUTION FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S 2014 DEFERRED ACTION FOR PARENTS OF AMERICANS AND LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS (DAPA) PROGRAM AND PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 2017 TRAVEL BANS. BY SO DOING, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT CENTRAL COMPONENTS OF MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REST UPON SOUND CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS. IT ALSO PROVIDES JUDGES WITH CONSTITUTIONALLY INSPIRED TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO PROMOTE PRESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, DISCIPLINE PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION, SECURE THE RULE OF LAW, AND THWART PRESIDENTIAL OPPORTUNISM.
792	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL ASSOCIATION OF INVESTMENT TREATIES WITH THE QUANTITY AND COST OF CAPITAL FLOWS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WHEREAS PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE EFFECT OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES (BIT) ON CAPITAL FLOWS HAS FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT (DFI), THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TOTAL FLOWS OF ALL TYPES. IT ALSO ASKS A QUESTION IGNORED BY PREVIOUS STUDIES: DO INVESTMENT TREATIES AFFECT THE COST THAT A DEVELOPING COUNTRY MUST PAY FOR THE CAPITAL IT RECEIVES? INSTEAD OF VIEWING INVESTMENT TREATIES AS JUST INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS PRESCRIBING RIGHTS AND DUTIES, THE ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES THEIR ROLE AS INFORMATION TO INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS. RELYING ON INSIGHTS FROM THE ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION AND SIGNALING THEORY, IT ARGUES THAT INVESTMENT TREATIES INFLUENCE CAPITAL FLOWS THROUGH THE SIGNALS THEY SEND TO INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS. ACCORDINGLY, IT CREATES A MODEL OF A "STRONG BIT SIGNAL COUNTRY" AND PROCEEDS TO IDENTIFY TWENTY-SIX COUNTRIES THAT FIT THE MODEL, WHILE IDENTIFYING FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES FIFTEEN COUNTRIES DEEMED TO BE "WEAK SIGNAL BIT COUNTRIES." AN ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL FLOWS TO BOTH GROUPS OF COUNTRIES FINDS THAT THE STRONG SIGNAL BIT COUNTRIES EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASED CAPITAL INFLOWS FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR BIT NEGOTIATION PROGRAM AND ALSO REVEALS THAT THEY OUTPERFORMED THE WEAK SIGNAL BIT COUNTRIES IN THIS RESPECT. USING DATA ON SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS AND WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE AUTHOR ALSO FINDS THAT SEVERAL COUNTRIES EXPERIENCED AN IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH INDICATORS FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR BIT PROGRAMS, LEADING TO THE INFERENCE THAT SUCH IMPROVEMENT MIGHT ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN A COUNTRY'S RISK PREMIUM AND THEREFORE A DECLINE IN ITS COST OF CAPITAL.
793	TWO OR THREE CENTURIES AGO MOST OF MANKIND WAS STILL VERY POOR. WHEN THE WEST OUTGREW MASS POVERTY, INDIA WAS A BRITISH COLONY AND SUFFERED FROM STAGNATION. WHEN EAST ASIAN ECONOMIES EXPLOITED THE ADVANTAGES OF BACKWARDNESS AND BENEFITED FROM EXPORT-LED GROWTH, INDIA REMAINED INWARD-LOOKING AND POOR. THE 'HINDU RATE OF GROWTH' PRESERVED MASS POVERTY. SINCE THE REFORMS OF THE EARLY 1990S INDIA HAS EXPLOITED THE ADVANTAGES OF BACKWARDNESS AND SOME GLOBAL MARKETS. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE ROOTS OF INDIA'S FAILURE TO GROW RAPIDLY BEFORE THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ARE ANALYZED. STAGNATION IS BLAMED ON RESTRICTIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, WHEREAS GROWTH IS EXPLAINED BY THE EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. BEFORE THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE CASTE SYSTEM AND THE LEGACY OF SULTANISM CURTAILED ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND CONTRIBUTED TO ECONOMIC STAGNATION. THEREAFTER, DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM DISTORTED INCENTIVES AND GENERATED 'PERMIT-LICENSE-QUOTA RAJ' OR A RENT-SEEKING SOCIETY. WHEN SOME OBSTACLES TO GROWTH WERE DISMANTLED, VIGOROUS GROWTH FOLLOWED. ALTHOUGH EXPANDING ECONOMIC FREEDOM REMAINS LIMITED. INDIA'S GROWTH POTENTIAL IS NOT YET FULLY EXPLOITED. INDIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION REMAIN INADEQUATE, REGULATIONS INTRUSIVE, AND THE BUDGET IN DEFICIT. THE RULE OF LAW LOOKS BETTER ON PAPER THAN FROM THE GROUND. COMPARED TO CHINA INDIAN PUBLIC POLICY STILL HAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS. 'MAOISTS' OR NAXALITES THREATEN POLITICAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM. GEOPOLITICS MAY EXPLAIN INDIA'S LATE, SLOW AND INCOMPLETE REFORMS. THE RISE OF ASIA, IN PARTICULAR OF CHINA AND INDIA, GENERATES GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGES OF ITS OWN. CONCEIVABLY, THE GLOBAL EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM PERMITS NOT ONLY THE RISE OF ASIA, BUT THE PEACEFUL MANAGEMENT OF THE COMING POWER TRANSITION BETWEEN ASIA AND THE WEST.
794	THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED FOR THIS ARTICLE HAS EXPLORED THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE EU AND HUNGARY SURROUNDING THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EUROPEANISATION PROCESS: TO WHAT EXTENT DO THEY DIVERGE, AND TO WHAT DEGREE DO THEY CONVERGE? BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ITS 2004 ACCESSION TO THE EU, HUNGARY HAS TRIED TO FOLLOW THE EU'S APPROACH TOWARDS LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. AND YET, FROM 2010 ONWARDS, THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED AN ILLIBERAL POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS FACT REVEALED A RIFT BETWEEN HUNGARY AND THE EU. THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON THE PROBLEM OF THE TRAJECTORY OF THE SYSTEMIC DETERIORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN HUNGARY, THE EU'S REACTION TO THIS SITUATION AND ITS DECISION TO APPLY A CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM IN 2022. THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THAT THE EU'S RELUCTANCE TO USE MORE SEVERE SANCTIONING TOOLS AFTER 2010 HAS HELPED HUNGARY UTILISE THE EU FUNDS TO DEVELOP AN ILLIBERAL DEMOCRATIC STATE WHICH DIVERGES FROM THE EU'S CONCEPT OF EUROPEANISATION. THE RESEARCH METHODS WE HAVE EMPLOYED ARE: THE QUANTITATIVE AND THE QUALITATIVE METHODS, SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS OF FACTS, THE COMPARATIVE METHOD, AND THE NEO-INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH. THE RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS ALLOW US TO STATE THAT UNTIL 2022, THE EU HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FORCE HUNGARY TO OBEY THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, THOUGH IT HAS MADE SOME EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION. THE WORSENING OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, AFTER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE ONSET OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE, DETERMINED THE EU TO CREATE A CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM THAT CORRELATES THE ACCESS TO EU SUBSIDIES WITH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE EU RULES.
795	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ON INCLUSIVE FINANCE IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 1996-2020. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES THE MODERATING ROLE OF GOVERNMENT QUALITY ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND INCLUSIVE FINANCE. WE COLLECTED FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES SUCH AS THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS, THE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. GOVERNMENT QUALITY IS MEASURED BY SIX DIMENSIONS: POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL. ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IS MEASURED BY CO2 EMISSIONS. INCLUSIVE FINANCE IS MEASURED BY THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX THROUGH DEPTH, ACCESS, AND EFFICIENCY RATIOS. THESE VARIABLES REPRESENT THE MOST USED IN PRIOR STUDIES AS THEY ARE PUBLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WHICH REPRESENT A REPUTABLE SOURCE OF TIMELY INFORMATION RELATED TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH BUSINESS EXECUTIVES OPERATE IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ON INCLUSIVE FINANCE. INCLUDING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE INDUCES A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN ALL INSTANCES. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS ARE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT. THE MODERATOR ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IS IMPROVED WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. OUR FINDINGS OFFER MORE MOTIVATION FOR REGULATORS AND GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAT INTEGRATE INCLUSIVE FINANCE TO MEET SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. OUR RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT AS THEY CAN HELP REGULATORS, INVESTORS, AND POLICYMAKERS TO ASSESS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL MODERATION ROLE OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCLUSIVE FINANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.
796	SUFFERING FROM A WELL-COVERED "CRISIS OF VOLUME," THE U.S. COURTS OF APPEALS HAVE PATCHED TOGETHER AN AD HOC SYSTEM OF TRIAGE IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE CASES WITH SUFFICIENT ATTENTION. FOR EXAMPLE, ONLY SOME CASES ARE ASSIGNED TO CENTRAL STAFF, ANALYZED BY LAW CLERKS, ORALLY ARGUED, DEBATED OVER BY JUDGES, OR DECIDED IN PUBLISHED OPINIONS. THE COURTS HAVE EVADED OVERT DISASTER BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE, SENIOR, AND VISITING JUDGES, BUT ADDING PERSONNEL POSES ITS OWN DEMANDS ON ATTENTION-JUDGES MUST ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO ONE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO COHERENTLY DEVELOP AND APPLY THE LAW. WITH TOO LITTLE TIME AND TOO MANY VOICES, THEY HAVE INCREASINGLY ABANDONED THE EFFORT TO COORDINATE THAT UNIFORM APPROACH TO JUDGING: THE COURTS NOW CREATE TRADITIONAL PRECEDENT IN LESS THAN 10% OF CASES, SOME LARGER COURTS HAVE STOPPED THE PRACTICE OF CIRCULATING OPINION DRAFTS TO THE FULL COURT, AND EN BANC PROCEEDINGS ARE INITIATED AT A MINUSCULE RATE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS AND ILLUSTRATES HOW COURTS CAN LEVERAGE ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MORE FAIRLY AND EFFECTIVELY ALLOCATE ATTENTION. A MACHINE-GENERATED MAPPING OF A COURT'S HISTORICAL DECISION PATTERNS-WHAT I TERM "STATISTICAL PRECEDENT"-CAN HELP A CIRCUIT COURT LOCATE THE DISTRICT COURT, AGENCY, STAFF ATTORNEY, LAW CLERK, AND PANEL DECISIONS THAT ARE MOST INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE COURT'S COLLECTIVE JURISPRUDENCE. STATISTICAL PRECEDENT CAN ALSO AID THE COURT IN IDENTIFYING AREAS OF LAW THAT ARE MOST IN NEED OF DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE ABILITY TO LOCATE LIKELY ERRORS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAW DEVELOPMENT, THE CIRCUIT COURTS COULD DISTRIBUTE ATTENTION SO AS TO REVITALIZE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE RULE OF LAW.
797	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM BASING ON THE DATA COLLECTED IN 182 COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1981 TO 2015. THE COUNTRIES ARE DIVIDED INTO GROUPS THROUGH CLUSTERING. THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THRESHOLD REGRESSION WITH FIXED EFFECTS INDICATE THAT IF A COUNTRY HAS HIGH LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY EFFICIENCY, AND OPEN MARKETS, THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN THE ECONOMY DETERMINES THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH: IN THE COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION THE THRESHOLD LEVEL OF INFLATION IS HIGHER (APPROXIMATELY 10%), AND ITS IMPACT IS MORE NEGATIVE IF THE THRESHOLD IS EXCEEDED; IN THE COUNTRIES WITH LOW LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION THE THRESHOLD LEVEL IS LOWER (APPROXIMATELY 2%), AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF INFLATION IS SOFTER IF THE THRESHOLD IS EXCEEDED. IN THE COUNTRIES WITH LOW ECONOMIC FREEDOM (AND WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION) THE THRESHOLD LEVEL IS LOW (APPROXIMATELY 3%), BUT INFLATION RATES HIGHER THAN THE THRESHOLD LEAD TO SERIOUS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES A MODIFICATION OF THE SOLOW MODEL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. TOTAL SAVINGS ARE DIVIDED INTO PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. PRIVATE INVESTORS ARE ASSUMED TO BE RISK-AVERSE, THEREFORE THEIR SAVING RATE AND LEVEL OF INVESTMENT DEPENDS NEGATIVELY ON THE LEVEL OF RISK IN THE ECONOMY DESCRIBED BY INFLATION. PUBLIC INVESTORS ARE ASSUMED TO BE RISK-NEUTRAL. THUS, INFLATION LEADS TO A SHARP DECREASE IN PRIVATE AND A GRADUAL DECLINE IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT, WHICH LEADS TO LOWER RATES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH DEPENDING ON THE RATIO OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INVESTORS IN THE ECONOMY.
798	THE PRACTICAL DISAPPEARANCE OF THE JURY TRIAL RANKS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY EXAMINED TOPICS IN AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. BUT, BY FOCUSING ON TRIAL SCARCITY, SCHOLARS HAVE MANAGED TO TELL ONLY PART OF THE STORY. THE UNEXPLORED FIRST-ORDER QUESTION IS WHETHER JURIES EVEN DO THEIR WORK WELL. AND THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION TURNS ON THE KINDS OF WORK JURY MEMBERS ARE TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO DO. ONCE UPON A TIME, TRIALS TURNED UPON PRACTICAL REASONING AND GENERAL MORAL BLAMEWORTHINESS. MODERN TRIALS HAVE COME TO FOCUS UPON LEGAL REASONING AND TECHNICAL GUILT ACCURACY. IN TURN, THE JURY HAS EVOLVED FROM A FLEXIBLE BODY TO A RULE-BOUND INSTITUTION. BUT, OF COURSE, EVEN AS TRIALS HAVE CHANGED, LAYPEOPLE'S CAPACITIES HAVE STAYED LARGELY THE SAME. LAYPEOPLE REMAIN MORE SKILLED AT THE ART OF EQUITABLE EVALUATION THAN THE SCIENCE OF LEGAL ANALYSIS. IT DOES NOT FOLLOW, HOWEVER, THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD REVERT TO EQUITABLE TRIAL PRACTICES. THE MODERN TRIAL IS PROFESSIONAL AND LEGALISTIC FOR GOOD REASON. THE RULE OF LAW COMMANDS THAT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS BE PRODUCTS OF PRECISELY DRAWN CRIMINAL CODES AND FORMAL PROCESSES. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE OTHER PROCEDURAL STAGES-ARREST, CHARGE, BAIL, BARGAIN, AND SENTENCE-WHERE EQUITABLE DISCRETION IS MORE APPROPRIATE. THESE ARE THE STAGES AT WHICH CRIMINAL JUSTICE SHOULD CONCENTRATE LAY EFFORTS. IN THIS SYMPOSIUM ESSAY, I DESCRIBE THE HISTORICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL TRENDS THAT HAVE ENTRENCHED POPULAR PARTICIPATION IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES. AND I PROPOSE REDIRECTING JURY PRACTICE FROM CRIMINAL TRIALS TO OTHER ADJUDICATORY SITES. FINALLY, I MAKE THE CASE THAT MY REFORMS ARE CONSISTENT WITH (AND PERHAPS EVEN INTEGRAL TO) THE LEGALITY PRINCIPLE, PROPERLY CONSIDERED.
799	THE RECOGNITION OF MINORITY AND MINORITIZED GROUPS IS A CENTRAL ISSUE FOR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES. FROM THE MOMENT SOCIETIES THINK OF THEMSELVES AS BEING COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE GROUPS, AND UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES AS BEING HETEROGENOUS, THEY MUST ALSO THINK ABOUT THE RELATIVE INCLUSION OF THESE GROUPS WITHIN THEIR WHOLE. THE ISSUE OF RECOGNITION IS AT THE HEART OF RULE OF LAW-BASED AND OPENLY PLURALISTIC SOCIETIES. THINKING ABOUT RECOGNITION INVOLVES NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT VARIOUS IDENTITIES WITHIN A PLURAL WHOLE, BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT RECOGNITION OF THE INJURIES SUFFERED BY MINORITY OR MINORITIZED GROUPS. FOR SOME, THESE INJURIES (AND SUFFERING) CAN BE A REALITY EXPERIENCED AND REPRODUCED OVER MULTIPLE GENERATIONS, AND CAN BE THE RESULT OF WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL A HISTORICAL WRONG. RECOGNIZING GROUPS SUCH AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OR AFRICAN DESCENDANTS IN THE AMERICAS, FOR EXAMPLE, ENTAILS GRAPPLING WITH A PAST OF COLONIZATION AND SLAVERY -TWO SITUATIONS PAR EXCELLENCE OF HISTORICAL WRONGS AND, OF COURSE, THEIR CONSEQUENCES. HENCE, RECOGNITION INEVITABLY ENCOMPASSES LINKS BETWEEN IDENTITY, THE EXPERIENCE OF MINORITIZATION, THE HISTORICAL WRONG IN QUESTION, AND REPARATIONS FOR THIS WRONG. THESE LINKS ARE PRECISELY THE SUBJECT OF THIS TEXT AND WILL BE EXAMINED IN THREE STAGES: A STUDY OF CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES TO RECOGNITION AND REPARATIONS; A LOOK AT THE NARRATIVE OF A PARTICULAR WRONG AND THE DEMANDS FOR REPARATIONS MADE BY A SPECIFIC GROUP, NAMELY THE BLACK MOVEMENT IN BRAZIL, WHICH RAISES THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES; AND FINALLY AN EXAMINATION OF THE RESPONSES TO SUCH DEMANDS, IN THE FORM OF LAWS, POLICIES, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIONS. THE CONCLUSION WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE CONCEPTUAL LINKS BETWEEN RECOGNITION AND REPARATIONS.
800	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE CAUSES OF FAILURE OF THE NEOLIBERAL MODEL OF CAPITALISM AND RISE OF STATE CAPITALISM. THE ARGUMENTS THAT EFFICIENT MARKET ECONOMY CAN THRIVE UNDER AUTOCRACY ARE REFUTED. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - BOTH WESTERN NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM AND STATE CAPITALISM IN CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE JUXTAPOSED AND CRITICALLY ANALYZED. FINDINGS - NEOLIBERALISM IS A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF ENTHUSIASTIC TRUE BELIEVERS WHO NEVER SUCCEED IN DEVELOPING A WORKABLE ECONOMIC SYSTEM BUT RATHER A TRAVESTY OF ITS OWN IDEAL. THE USA INSTEAD OF AN EFFICIENT, COMPETITIVE MARKET ECONOMY BECAME A PLAYGROUND FOR LOBBYISTS AND A CORPORATE AUTOCRACY FRAUGHT WITH DEEP IMBALANCES. YET DUE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND INHERENT FREEDOMS THE POST-NEOLIBERAL USA WILL BE CAPABLE OF "SELF REPAIR" WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE IN STATE CAPITALISM. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN POLITICS AND ECONOMICS ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO BE PRESENTED AS PREDICABLE DEPENDENCES. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IS NECESSARY AND REVEALING BUT IT HAS OBVIOUS ANALYTICAL LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE TOOLS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PROCLAMATION OF THE END OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IS UNFOUNDED. THE NEOLIBERAL IDEOLOGUES ARE HARDLY TO BLAME FOR THE FAILURES OF THE WESTERN MARKET ECONOMY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MERELY CREATED A PRETEXT FOR CORPORATE AMERICA TO REDUCE THE REGULATORY POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE SOLUTION IS IN RETURNING TO THE MODEL OF INTERVENTIONIST GOVERNMENT MINDFUL OF THE NATION'S LONG-TERM WELLBEING. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE AUTHOR CREATES UNIQUE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WESTERN MARKET CAPITALISM AND STATE CAPITALISM AND POINTS OUT CLEAR ADVANTAGES OF DEMOCRATIC WESTERN MARKET CAPITALISM OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN THE HEAT OF THE POST-CRISES DEBATES.
801	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CURRENT STATE OF ORTHODOXY, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEM OF ITS REFORM, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE NEED FOR RENEWAL AND MODERNIZATION. THE ARTICLE ESTABLISHES THAT THE REASONS FOR THE NEED TO REFORM IN ORTHODOXY ARE THE CRISIS OF THE UNITY OF THE ECUMENICAL CHURCH, THE CRISIS OF THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES OF LOCAL CHURCHES, THE CRISIS IN LOCAL CHURCH COMMUNITIES, AND THE SIGNIFICANT DEPENDENCE OF ORTHODOXY ON NATIONAL TRADITIONS. THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT THE MAIN ASPECTS OF CHURCH REFORM ARE THE RENEWAL OF TRADITION, THE NEED FOR A NEW READING OF THE CANONS, RETHINKING THE NEGATIVE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST, AND OVERCOMING THE CHURCH'S DEPENDENCE ON STATE DICTATES AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES. THE RENEWAL OF ORTHODOXY REQUIRES THE FORMATION OF A MODERN ORTHODOX CULTURE THAT WILL DEVELOP PARTNER RELATIONS WITH CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE, BE OPEN TO SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND MODERN TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCE MODERN THEOLOGY, AND HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH OTHER CHRISTIAN CHURCHES. AN IMPORTANT CONCLUSION OF THE ARTICLE IS THE PROPOSAL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TOP -DOWN REFORMS OF ORTHODOXY, WHICH ARE CARRIED OUT ONLY BY THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP, AND ITS BOTTOM-UP RENEWAL, IN WHICH ALL ACTIVE ORTHODOX AND PUBLIC GROUPS OF SOCIETY CAN PARTICIPATE. THE AUTHORS HAVE FOUND THAT UKRAINIAN ORTHODOXY IS FACING THE TASK OF IMPLEMENTING THE DECISIONS OF THE SOCIAL DOCTRINE OF THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE INTO ITS OWN SOCIAL DOCTRINE, RETHINKING ITS ATTITUDE TO MODERN ECONOMIC AND LEGAL PROCESSES, PROBLEMS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THE RULE OF LAW, EDUCATION, AND CULTURE. ONLY THE IDEA OF CHURCH RENEWAL CAN BECOME THE BASIS FOR PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE AMONG CHURCHES IN UKRAINE AND PROMISING PARTNER RELATIONS WITH SOCIETY AND THE STATE.
802	PURPOSE THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY COMMUNITY FROM 1990 TO 2019. THE LITERATURE REVEALS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IS STILL DEBATABLE AND THE EXISTING FINDINGS ARE INCONCLUSIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH CARBON DIOXIDE IS THE REGRESSAND; WHILE, URBANIZATION, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT (FD), RULE OF LAW (ROL) AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (GEF) ARE THE REGRESSORS. JOHANSEN FISHER AND KAO RESIDUAL CO-INTEGRATION TESTS ALONGSIDE THE FULLY MODIFIED AND DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. THE CAUSALITY TESTS RESULTS SHOW THAT CARBON DIOXIDE GRANGER CAUSES URBANIZATION, GDP AND FD UNIT DIRECTIONALLY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE COUNTRIES' GOVERNMENTS SHOULD EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS TO REGULATE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. URBANIZATION LAWS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO LIMIT URBANIZATION ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATING EFFECTS ON CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. THIS OCCURS AS THE COUNTRIES PRACTICED UNREGULATED URBANIZATION WHICH INCREASES POPULATION'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS SUSTAINABLE GREEN URBANIZATION POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION THROUGH TREE PLANTING AND HORTICULTURE. BALANCE DEVELOPMENT IN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS IS VITAL TO DECONGEST THE URBAN CITIES' PRESSURE IN THE STATES. THE GOVERNMENTS SHOULD MOTIVATE THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH RURAL INVESTMENTS CAPTIVATING POLICIES TO LIMIT RURAL URBAN MIGRATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE VALUE BY SUPPORTING A POSITIVE LINK BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IN THE CEMAC ZONE. THE CAUSALITY TESTS FINDINGS CONFIRM THE VIEW THAT CARBON DIOXIDE GRANGER CAUSES URBANIZATION, GDP AND FD UNIT DIRECTIONALLY. THIS VALUE ADDITION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE GOVERNMENTS AND POLICY MAKERS TO MITIGATE URBANIZATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS IN THE CEMAC REGION.
803	THE SUDAN COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT (CPA) THAT WAS CONCLUDED IN JANUARY 2005 ENDED MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN (GOS) AND THE SUDAN PEOPLE'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT (SPLM). THE CPA PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING PEACE AND REFORMING SUDAN WITHIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW. DESPITE ITS COMMITMENT TO THE CPA, THE GOS OPTED NOT TO IMPLEMENT THE ABYEI PROTOCOL, ONE OF THE SIX PROTOCOLS OF THE AGREEMENT. THE GOS REJECTED THE REPORT OF THE ABYEI BOUNDARIES COMMISSION (ABC), WHILE SPLM ACCEPTED IT AS FINAL AND BINDING AS PER THE PROVISIONS OF THE CPA. THIS DISPUTE OVER THIS REPORT LASTED MORE THAN THREE YEARS AND RESULTED IN ERUPTION OF WAR IN THE ABYEI AREA THAT CAUSED MASSIVE DISPLACEMENT AND LOSS OF INNOCENT LIVES. IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID FURTHER CONFLICT, THE PARTIES AGREED TO TAKE THEIR DISPUTE TO THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION (PCA) IN THE HAGUE FOR FINAL AND BINDING DECISION. SINCE THE ABYEI ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FINAL AND BINDING DECISION OVER THE BOUNDARIES OF ABYEI AREA, ITS IMPLEMENTATION FACES ENORMOUS CHALLENGES INCLUDING THE RELUCTANCE BY GOS TO RESPECT THE AWARD. SUDAN HAS A RECORD OF DISHONOURING AGREEMENTS AND IF IT IS ALLOWED AGAIN TO DISHONOR THIS AGREEMENT, THERE WILL BE NO CHANCE OF ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF CONFLICT IN THE SUDAN. THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION OF THE ABYEI TRIBUNAL WILL BE A LITMUS TEST TO THE COMMITMENT OF THE SUDANESE LEADERSHIP AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPA AS THE ONLY HOPE FOR BUILDING PEACE AND REFORMING SUDAN FOR BETTER.
804	THE SUPREME COURT'S 1947 DECISION IN SEC V. CHENERY CORP. ( CHENERY II) IS GENERALLY TAKEN AS BLANKET AUTHORIZATION FOR AGENCIES TO MAKE LAW THROUGH EITHER ADJUDICATION OR RULEMAKING IF THEIR ORGANIC STATUTES PERMIT BOTH MODES. WE THINK THIS IS AN OVERREADING OF THE DOCTRINE. THE DECISION IN CHENERY II NEED NOT BE READ SO BROADLY, AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO READ IT MORE NARROWLY. THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IS THAT AGENCY LAWMAKING THROUGH ADJUDICATION PRESENTS SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS INVOLVING DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND SUBDELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER, AT LEAST IF THE AGENCY ACTION DEPRIVES PEOPLE OF LIFE, LIBERTY, OR PROPERTY. THE SUBDELEGATION CONCERN IS PRESENT EVEN IF, AS WE ASSUME IN THIS ARTICLE, CONGRESS HAS SOME AUTHORITY TO SUBDELEGATE A MEASURE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER. CONGRESS CAN SUBDELEGATE ONLY POWER THAT IT POSSESSES, AND CONGRESS POSSESSES NO POWER TO DEPRIVE PEOPLE OF RIGHTS THROUGH ADJUDICATION, SO AGENCIES CANNOT RECEIVE SUCH POWER FROM CONGRESS. NOR DO AGENCIES HAVE ANY INHERENT EXECUTIVE POWER TO DEPRIVE PEOPLE OF RIGHTS THROUGH ADJUDICATION; THAT PRINCIPLE IS THE ESSENCE OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW.WE TREAT THESE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS AS A REASON TO READ STATUTORY AUTHORIZATIONS TO FEDERAL AGENCIES NARROWLY TO CREATE A PRESUMPTION AGAINST, RATHER THAN FOR, AGENCY POWER TO MAKE LAW THROUGH ADJUDICATION. WE ALSO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE CHENERY II CASE, INCLUDING CLOSE LOOKS AT THE ARGUMENTS OF COUNSEL AND THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE JUSTICES, TO SHOW HOW A NARROWER READING OF CHENERY II IS BOTH POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF A NARROWER READING OF CHENERY II. THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE BOTH MODEST AND CONSISTENT WITH RULE-OF-LAW VALUES.
805	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS A CRITIQUE OF THE QUASI-NEOLIBERAL VIOLENCE OF ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH ARE THE MOST PROBLEMATIC AND MOST THREATENING BRAKE PHENOMENON OF TRANSITION. THEY HAVE BEEN PRODUCED, STRENGTHENED AND REPRODUCED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF MOST POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES IN THE LAST THREE DECADES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEMYSTIFY NEOLIBERALISM, ITS IDEOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND MONISTIC ABSOLUTIZATIONS, AS WELL AS QUASI-NEOLIBERAL MANIFESTATIONS, WHICH IN MANY POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WERE CARRIED OUT DIRECTLY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS. ALSO, THE GOAL IS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CAUSES OF THE LONG-TERM CRISIS, CHAOS, INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE, AND LAWLESSNESS, AND TO ENABLE THE RECOGNITION OF TOO VISIBLE (ALBEIT BLURRED), RHETORICAL AND "MESSIANIC" RECIPES, WHICH ARE, IN FACT, DEVELOPMENTAL SHACKLES. THE PAPER IS BASED ON TWO HYPOTHESES: FIRST, THAT ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ABUSED AND ENSLAVED FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN MOST TRANSITION COUNTRIES, WHICH HAS LED TO NUMEROUS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOMS, AND CIVILIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND SECOND, THAT A TRANSITIONAL HINDERING MECHANISM WAS CREATED, WHICH GENERATED A NEO-EXPLOITATIVE, APOLOGETIC, NEO-TOTALITARIAN AND CRISIS ENVIRONMENT. THE PAPER USES COMMON METHODS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES, INCLUDING THE METHODS OF GENERALIZATION, DESCRIPTION, ABSTRACTION, COMPARISON, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS STATED THAT THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION AND CRITICAL DEMYSTIFICATION OF THE INTEREST CONNECTIONS AND CONDITIONING OF NEOLIBERALISM, ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS, AND THE CRISIS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT, AND THAT THEIR EXPONENTS (ALLEGED REFORMERS AND NEW ELITES) HAD AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, SCIENTIFIC, EDUCATIONAL, CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE THEY DEGRADED AND DESTROYED THEM.
806	MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATES, FORGED AROUND THE NUCLEAR IDEA OF A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE LIMITATION OF POWER, HAVE IN TIME SHAPED THE PRINCIPLES OF CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY AS ELEMENTS THAT ARE INHERENT TO THE VERY IDEA OF DEMOCRACY. IT IS TYPICAL AND SUBSTANTIAL OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE TO ADOPT A CONSTITUTION AND TO EMERGE IN LAW ORDINATION AS A LIMITED STATE, ENDOWED WITH RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC POWERS SUBJECTED TO A CONTROL OVER ITS DECISIONS THAT IS EXERTED BY THOSE WHO REPRESENT THE PUBLIC WILL. WITH THE PASSING OF TIME, THESE NOTIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNT RENDERING HAVE CONSTRUCTED A THEORY FOR THE CONTROL OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ITSELF, WHICH HAVE REPRESENTED, TO A GREAT EXTENT, THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE WAYS AND MEANS IN WHICH THIS CONTROL HAS BEEN CONSTITUTIONALISED OR LEGALISED ARE MANY AND VARIED, DEPENDING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON EVOLUTION FROM AN ABSOLUTE STATE TO A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, LATER UNDERGOING PROFOUND TRANSFORMATIONS, ENDING IN THE CURRENT SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE OF THE PRESENT CONSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRIES THAT INTEGRATE THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHERE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY ARE TODAY MUTUALLY ASSUMED CONCEPTS. THIS RESEARCH WORK SEEKS TO VERIFY THE ADEQUACY OF CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS WITH REGARD TO POLITICAL MANDATE AND LEGAL ORDINATION, ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT CASES, IN WHICH ANY FORM OF INADEQUACY MEETS WITH IMPLICIT OR EXPLICIT SANCTION OR REPROBATION. AS THE STATE HAS BECOME MORE DEMOCRATIC, THIS CONTROL HAS BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. THUS, ONE OF ITS SPECIALISATIONS HAS GIVEN RISE TO POLITICAL PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OVER THE BUDGET AND FINANCIAL ECONOMIC CONTROL OVER THE PUBLIC SECTOR OF THE STATE.
807	THE IDEA OF CIVIL SOCIETY HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF CONTESTED DEBATES, AND HAS BEEN A DOMINANT DISCOURSE IN RECENT CHINESE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL LIFE SINCE THE LATE 1980S BOTH IN MAINLAND CHINA AND TAIWAN. THE PAPER DESCRIBES AND EXPLAINS THE EMERGENCE AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE IDEAS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. IT ANALYZES POLITICAL INNOVATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH, AND DEMOCRATIC IMPLICATIONS OF, THE CONCEPTUAL CHANGES OF CIVIL SOCIETY BOTH IN MAINLAND CHINA AND TAIWAN. THESE CONCEPTUAL CHANGES CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS A SHIFT FROM THE IDEA OF THE TOTALITARIAN SOCIETY TO THE LIBERAL IDEA OF CIVIL SOCIETY BEFORE JUNE 4, 1989, TO THE ANTAGONIST MODEL OF CIVIL SOCIETY AS A DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY AMONG SOME INTELLECTUALS OVERSEAS AFTER 1989, AND THEN TO THE MUTUAL SUPPORT MODEL BETWEEN THE STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY SINCE 1992 IN MAINLAND CHINA. THESE CHANGES ALSO INVOLVE A SHIFT FROM THE ANTAGONIST MODEL OF CIVIL SOCIETY, WHICH WAS POPULAR IN 1986-87, TO THE HABERMASIAN VERSION OF CIVIL SOCIETY ON TAIWAN. THE DISCOURSE ON CIVIL SOCIETY IN BOTH TAIWAN AND MAINLAND CHINA SEEMS TO SUPPORT, CONFIRM, AND REINFORCE THE KEY ELEMENT OF THE WESTERN LIBERAL IDEA OF CIVIL SOCIETY-THE NECESSITY OF THE NORMATIVE DISTINCTION OF THE STATE FROM CIVIL SOCIETY. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO BELIEVE THAT ALL THE PROBLEMS, AND AH THE SOLUTIONS LIE WITHIN THE BODY OF CIVIL SOCIETY; THE IDEA OF CIVIL SOCIETY ALONE CANNOT OFFER A SOLUTION TO ALL THE PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO TURN FOR HELP FROM THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, CITIZENSHIP, AND THE RULE OF LAW; ABOVE ALL, CIVIL SOCIETY ITSELF HAS TO BE DEMOCRATIZED.
808	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER WAS TO CONDUCT A LEGAL-REALIST ASSESSMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRISON SYSTEM RESPONSE TO COVID-19. SEVERELY CONGESTED AND ILL-RESOURCED PRISON SYSTEMS IN AFRICA FACE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES AMPLIFIED BY COVID-19. SOUTH AFRICA HAS RECORDED THE HIGHEST COVID-19 POSITIVITY RATE IN AFRICA AND, ON MARCH 15TH 2020, DECLARED A NATIONAL STATE OF DISASTER. THE FIRST PRISON SYSTEM CASE WAS NOTIFIED ON APRIL 6TH 2020. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A LEGAL-REALIST ASSESSMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRISON SYSTEM RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN THE 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING INITIAL CASE NOTIFICATION FOCUSED ON THE MINIMUM STATE OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH HUMAN, HEALTH AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND STAFF WERE UPHELD DURING DISASTER MEASURES. FINDINGS A LEGAL-REALIST ACCOUNT WAS DEVELOPED, WHICH REVEALED THE INDETERMINATE NATURE OF APPLICATION OF SOUTH AFRICAN COVID-19 GOVERNMENT DIRECTIVES, ILL-RESOURCED COVID-19 MITIGATION MEASURES, ALARMING OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND PRISON CONDITIONS AND INADEQUATE STANDARDS OF HEALTH CARE IN PRISONS WHEN EVALUATED AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW DURING STATE DECLARATION OF DISASTER. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS LEGAL-REALIST ASSESSMENT IS ORIGINAL BY VIRTUE OF ITS UNIQUE EVALUATION OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRISON SYSTEM APPROACH TO TACKLING COVID-19. IT ACKNOWLEDGED STATE EFFORTS, POLICYMAKING PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES AND HOW THESE OPERATED WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM ITSELF. BY MOVING BEYOND THE DELETERIOUS IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE ALREADY PRECARIOUS SOUTH AFRICAN PRISON SYSTEM, THE AUTHORS ARGUE FOR RIGHTS ASSURANCE FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN ITS PRISONS, IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE AND GREATER SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY OF ALL DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIBERTY IN SOUTH AFRICA.
809	HOW TO OPTIMIZE CHINA'S PROTECTIVE MECHANISM FOR OVERSEAS CITIZENS HAS BECOME THE TOP AGENDA OF CHINA'S PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. A COMPARISON OF THE EVACUATION POLICIES OF CHINA AND THE US IN THE 2010S REVEALS THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S OPERATIONS ATTACH MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE ACTUAL EFFECTS OF EVACUATION AND THE FEELINGS OF CITIZENS, WHILE CONSIDERING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CITIZENS AND COST BURDEN LESS. THIS GENEROUS EVACUATION POLICY CAN BE PARTLY RATIONALIZED BY CHINA'S DOMESTIC FACTORS, SUCH AS THE "GOING GLOBAL" POLICY, ITS CONTEMPORARY IMAGE AS A POPULOUS RISING POWER, AND ITS TRADITIONAL FAMILY-COUNTRY NARRATIVE, WHICH GENERATES A FAMILIAL CONCEPTION OF STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONS AND ENCOURAGES THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY FOR CITIZENS. WHILE THE FAMILIAL CONCEPTION OF STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONS IS CONDUCTIVE TO BUILDING NATIONAL IDENTITY AND COHESION, IT BLURS THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, UNDERCUTS THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, CAUSES WASTE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES, AND OVERBURDENS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. AS CHINA'S INDUSTRIALIZATION AND URBANIZATION PROGRESS, HOW TO REVISE THE LONG-ESTABLISHED FAMILIAL CONCEPTION OF STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONS AND ESTABLISH A RESPONSIBLE CIVIL SOCIETY BASED ON CONTRACTUAL RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME AN URGENT ISSUE. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE PARENTAL ROLE OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THE PROTECTION OF OVERSEAS CITIZENS AND ATTRIBUTES IT PARTLY TO THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY-COUNTRY NARRATIVE, WHICH GENERATES A FAMILY CONCEPTION OF STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONS. WHILE THIS CONCEPTION IS CONDUCTIVE TO BUILDING NATIONAL IDENTITY AND COHESION, IT CAUSES WASTE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES AND OVERBURDENS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. IT IS NECESSARY TO REVISE THE LONG-ESTABLISHED CONCEPTION AND CULTIVATE A RESPONSIBLE CIVIL SOCIETY TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA.
810	IN HIS FAMOUS BOOK JUST AND UNJUST WARS, MICHAEL WALZER ARTICULATES A THESIS HE CALLS THE "MORAL EQUALITY OF SOLDIERS,"NAMELY, THE PRINCIPLE THAT COMBATANTS HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT TO KILL OTHER COMBATANTS IN WAR, REGARDLESS OF THE JUSTICE OF THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY ARE FIGHTING. THE MORAL EQUALITY THESIS, AS I SHALL CALL IT, IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF TRADITIONAL JUST WAR THEORY, IN THAT IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR DISTINGUISHING THE JUS IN BELLO FROM THE JUS AD BELLUM. IT ALSO PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN IDENTIFYING THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMBATANTS AND CIVILIANS. THE MORAL EQUALITY THESIS HAS RECENTLY COME UNDER ATTACK BY SCHOLARS OF JUST WAR THEORY, NOTABLY PHILOSOPHER JEFF MCMAHAN, ON THE GROUNDS THAT KILLING FOR IMMORAL PURPOSES CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED, AND SO IT CANNOT BE TRUE THAT COMBATANTS ALL HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHT TO KILL, REGARDLESS OF THE JUSTICE OF THEIR CAUSE. IN THIS ESSAY, I DEFEND THE MORAL EQUALITY THESIS IN ITS TRADITIONAL FORMULATION. WITHOUT IT, I ARGUE, THE RULE OF LAW WOULD NOT APPLY IN WAR. THE FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE EQUAL RIGHT OF COMBATANTS TO KILL IN WAR, I SUGGEST, CREATES AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE RULES OF WAR AND BASIC CONCEPTS IN THE LAW AND MORALITY OF SELF-DEFENSE, AN INCONSISTENCY THAT MCMAHAN HIMSELF WOULD THINK UNDESIRABLE. I ARGUE THAT MCMAHAN'S ARGUMENT APPLIES MORE COMPELLINGLY TO ARMED CONFLICT IN ASYMMETRICAL WARFARE. ARGUABLY, THE MORAL EQUALITY THESIS DOES NOT APPLY IN AN ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN COMBATANTS AND UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS. IN THAT CONTEXT, THE DIVERGENCE FROM THE LAW AND MORALITY OF SELF-DEFENSE IS LESS OF A CONCERN.
811	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE TALE OF THE TWO CITIES, CIUDAD JUAREZ AND TIJUANA. THESE TWO MUNICIPALITIES ARE THE LARGEST OF MEXICO'S METROPOLISES ALONG THE COUNTRY'S ROUGHLY 2,000-MILE FRONTIER WITH THE UNITED STATES, THE LONGEST LAND BORDER BETWEEN THE "GLOBAL NORTH" AND THE "GLOBAL SOUTH." THIS NARRATIVE BUILDS ON SEVERAL YEARS OF RESEARCH REGARDING MEXICO'S RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES, DURING WHICH THE AUTHOR CONDUCTED MULTIPLE FIELD RESEARCH TRIPS TO BOTH CIUDAD JUAREZ AND TIJUANA. BY VIRTUE OF THEIR STATUS AS BORDER CITIES, BOTH LIE AT THE FRINGES OF THE STATE AND THE VERY LIMITS OF ITS COERCIVE MONOPOLY ON FORCE. CONSEQUENTIALLY, THESE ARE TWO CITIES THAT ALSO STAND AT THE FRONTIERS OF GLOBALIZATION, THANKS TO THE OPENING OF TRADE, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS EXPANDED FLOWS OF COMMERCE, CAPITAL, AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE US-MEXICAN BORDER. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ERUPTION OF ENORMOUS VIOLENCE IN BOTH CITIES AROUND 2008, AND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO ITS GRADUAL REDUCTION IN BOTH PLACES. THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THAT THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN THESE TWO BORDER CITIES HAS DEPRIVED INDIVIDUALS OF EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET FOR ILLICIT DRUGS HAS HELPED TO FILL THE GAP. ULTIMATELY, THOUGH, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT VIOLENCE AMONG DRUG TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS RESULTED FROM SPLITS AND THE BREAKDOWN OF ALLIANCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DYNAMICS WITHIN AND AMONG THESE ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS NEWFOUND PRESSURES FROM US AND MEXICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE AUTHOR CONTENDS THAT THE REDUCTION OF VIOLENCE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GRADUAL MONOPOLIZATION OF CONTROL OVER ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES BY THE SINALOA CARTEL.
812	ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE TRANSFORMED AND EXPANDED THE WAYS IN WHICH POLICING IS RUN. ONE NEW MANIFESTATION IS THE MASS ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING OF PRIVATE FACIAL IMAGES VIA AUTOMATIC FACIAL RECOGNITION BY THE POLICE: WHAT WE CONCEPTUALISE AS AFR-BASED POLICING. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A LACK OF CLARITY ON THE MANNER AND EXTENT TO WHICH THIS LARGELY-UNREGULATED TECHNOLOGY IS USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND ON ITS IMPACT ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SOCIAL UNDERSTANDING AND INVOLVEMENT ARE STILL INSUFFICIENT IN THE CONTEXT OF AFR TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS SOCIAL TRUST IN AND LEGITIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLIGENT GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE DELINEATES THE FUNCTION CREEP OF THIS NEW CONCEPT, IDENTIFYING THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE HARMS IT ENGENDERS. A TECHNOLOGICAL, CONTEXTUAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE FUNCTION CREEP OF AFR IN POLICING WILL EVIDENCE THE COMPREHENSIVE CREEP OF TRAINING DATASETS AND LEARNING ALGORITHMS, WHICH HAVE BY-PASSED AN IGNORANT PUBLIC. WE THUS ARGUE INDIVIDUAL HARMS TO DIGNITY, PRIVACY AND AUTONOMY, COMBINE TO CONSTITUTE A FORM OF CULTURAL HARM, IMPACTING DIRECTLY ON INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. WHILE RECOGNISING THE LIMITATIONS OF WHAT THE LAW CAN ACHIEVE, WE CONCLUDE BY CONSIDERING OPTIONS FOR REDRESS AND THE CREATION OF AN ENHANCED REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK MODEL, OR CODE OF CONDUCT, AS A MEANS OF ENCOURAGING CULTURAL CHANGE FROM PREVAILING POLICE INDIFFERENCE TO ENFORCING RESPECT FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS POTENTIALLY ENGAGED. THE IMPERATIVE WILL BE TO STRENGTHEN THE TOP-LEVEL DESIGN AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF AFR POLICING, IMBUING IT WITH THE VALUES IMPLICIT IN THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATISATION AND SCIENTISATION-TO ENHANCE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN AFR SOCIAL GOVERNANCE, AND TO PROMOTE CIVILISED SOCIAL GOVERNANCE IN AFR POLICING.
813	THE REGULATION ON EDUCATION SUFFERS FROM THE LACK OF REGULATORY QUALITY OF MANY LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT HAS BEEN DENOUNCED IN MANY COUNTRIES. THE CONCERN FOR THE QUALITY OF THE NORMS IS OLD, BUT IT HAS INTENSIFIED IN THE FACE OF "MOTORIZED" AND "UNBRIDLED" LEGISLATION THAT IS BEING THE RESULT OF THE EXERCISE OF THE NORMATIVE POWER BY THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. SOME CAUSES OF THE DEGRADATION OF LEGISLATIVE QUALITY, STILL LIMITED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, CAN BE IDENTIFIED. AMONG THE MEANS FOR REMEDYING OR, AT LEAST, ALLEVIATING OR CURBING THE PROBLEM, SPAIN HAS, ALTHOUGH STILL WITH LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS TO DATE, THE ROLE GIVEN TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE, THE GENERAL CODIFICATION COMMISSION, THE OFFICE OF COORDINATION AND REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY ARE SOME DEFECTS OR ASPECTS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED ON IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FORMED BY THE MAIN STATUTES (ORGANIC LAWS) REGULATING EDUCATION IN SPAIN. THE ENTIRE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE LEGAL METHOD, THE BASIS OF WELL-FOUNDED DOCTRINAL OPINIONS, LEGAL INFORMATION AND SOME JUDICIAL DECISIONS, UNDER A CONCEPT OF KNOWLEDGE OR LEGAL SCIENCE THAT ASSUMES THE INTEGRITY OF ITS UNDERSTANDING FROM THE DIGEST OF JUSTINIAN ROMAN LAW AS DIVINARUM ATQUE HUMANARUM RERUM NOTITIA, IUSTI ATQUE INIUSTI SCIENTIA, AND WHICH, THEREFORE, IS FOUNDED ON ONTOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND INCLUDES DUE ATTENTION TO LOGIC AND LINGUISTICS. THE CONCLUSION ARISES FROM THE STUDY AS A WHOLE: THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING LEGISLATIVE QUALITY THAT ARISES FROM THE OUTSET AS A SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENT OF ALL LEGISLATION, AND WHICH IS SO LACKING, CANNOT FAIL TO BE DECISIVELY AND CRITICALLY PURSUED.
814	THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE HIGHLY APPRECIATES THE MONOGRAPH BY I. V. POTKINA "ON THE EVE OF THE CATASTROPHE. THE STATE AND ECONOMY OF RUSSIA IN 1914-1917". THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK PROPOSED A NEW APPROACH TO THEIR STUDY, WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY FEATURES OF THE FORMATION OF THE MILITARY-ECONOMIC MOBILIZATION MODEL AND MANAGEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. I. V. POTKINA CLASSIFIED EIGHT MAIN DIRECTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC POLICY. COMPARING THE WAYS OF REGULATING THE ECONOMY OF THE TSARIST AND THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT, THE AUTHOR SHOWED THAT THESE WERE DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE FORMATION OF THE MOBILIZATION MODEL, AND IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT THAT LED TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE ECONOMY. AS A RESULT, THE AUTHOR OF THE MONOGRAPH CAME TO A REASONABLE CONCLUSION THAT THE ECONOMIC POLICY OF THE TSARIST GOVERNMENT WAS IN LINE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE TIME AND PAN-EUROPEAN TRENDS. THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE THESIS ABOUT THE SO-CALLED SYSTEMIC CRISIS OF THE AUTOCRACY FAR-FETCHED. HE CONNECTS THE PROBLEMS OF THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT IN THE LATE 19(TH) - EARLY 20(TH) CENTURIES WITH THE FACT THAT IN 1861-1905 RUSSIA TRIED TO REALIZE ITS FIRST ANTI-CAPITALIST UTOPIA - THAT IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGE IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE A "DISTINCTIVE" GREAT POWER, THAT IS, TO INFLUENCE THE DESTINIES OF THE WORLD, REJECTING EVERYTHING DUE TO WHICH COMPETITORS AND OPPONENTS HAVE ACHIEVED PROSPERITY, PRIMARILY, THE GENERAL CIVIL LEGAL SYSTEM, THE CORRESPONDING RIGHTS OF ALL STRATA OF THE POPULATION AND COMPLETE FREEDOM OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ONLY IN 1906 DID THE TRANSITION TO THE RULE OF LAW BEGIN.
815	THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH ON LOW CARBON FINANCIAL SUPPORT STRATEGIES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT STATUS OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INSPECTORS, THE ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, OPERATION MECHANISM AND CAPACITY OF THE CURRENT ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INSPECTORS, THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEFECTS AND PROBLEMS IN THE WORK OF THE INSPECTORS, TO PROVIDE A BASIS FOR IMPROVING THE INSPECTION FUNCTION. THROUGH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IT IS OF GREAT THEORETICAL VALUE AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO REALISE THE FULL UTILIZATION OF RESOURCES, THE OPTIMIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE AND THE LOW-CARBON CYCLE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. COMBINING THE CURRENT SITUATION AND CONSTRAINTS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR LOW-CARBON AGRICULTURE, WE PROPOSE TARGETED FINANCIAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SUCH AS CREDIT INNOVATION FOR AGRICULTURAL GREEN PROJECTS RICH IN CHARACTERISTICS AND CONDUCIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-CARBON AGRICULTURE, BROADENING PRIVATE FINANCING CHANNELS FOR LOW-CARBON AGRICULTURE, AND EXPLORING LOW-CARBON AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE. THE ENTROPY VALUE METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE INDEX WEIGHTS, AND THE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION METHOD IS USED TO CALCULATE THE COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION VALUE OF THE TWO SUBSYSTEMS; FINALLY, THE COUPLING COORDINATION DEGREE MODEL IS USED TO ANALYSE THE COUPLING DEGREE AND COUPLING COORDINATION DEGREE OF THE CARBON FINANCE AND LOW-CARBON AGRICULTURE COMPOSITE SYSTEMS, AND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE COUPLING COORDINATION DEGREE ARE ANALYSED ON THIS BASIS. ALTHOUGH THE COUPLING LEVEL BETWEEN THEM IS AT A LOW LEVEL OF COUPLING, IT IS IN TRANSITION TO A MEDIUM COUPLING; THE COUPLING COORDINATION DEGREE IS AT A MILD DISORDER, AND GRADUALLY IN TRANSITION TO A NEAR DISORDER.
816	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CONCISE ANALYSIS OF LAWMAKING, INSPIRED BY WHAT I PERCEIVE TO BE THE REALIST CONCEPTION OF LAW. LEGAL REALISM, AS I RECONSTRUCT IT, STANDS FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT LAW IS A GOING INSTITUTION (OR SET OF INSTITUTIONS) DISTINGUISHED BY THE DIFFICULT ACCOMMODATION OF THREE CONSTITUTIVE, YET IRRESOLVABLE, TENSIONS BETWEEN POWER AND REASON, SCIENCE AND CRAFT, AND TRADITION AND PROGRESS. UNLIKE SOME CARICATURES OF LEGAL REALISM, THIS UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL REALISM EXPLAINS WHY THE ORIGINAL LEGAL REALISTS INVESTED TIME AND ENERGY IN VARIOUS ARENAS OF LAWMAKING, SHAPING AND RESHAPING THE VARIOUS RULES AND STANDARDS THAT ARE TO GOVERN SOCIETY. THIS SUSTAINED EFFORT REFLECTS A MATURE POSITION REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW WHEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE MALLEABILITY OF LEGAL DOCTRINE AS SUCH, THE SOCIAL PRACTICE OF LAW IMPLIES STABLE EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE CONTENT OF THE LAW AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND PLACE. REDRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN PROMULGATION AND APPLICATION ALONG THESE CONVENTIONALIST LINES PAVES THE WAY FOR A REALIST ACCOUNT OF LAWMAKING. THIS ACCOUNT IS LIKELY TO RELY ON CONTEXTUAL AND PRAGMATIC ANALYSES OF THE PERTINENT ISSUES AT HAND. THUS, IT IMPLIES THAT, RATHER THAN OPTING FOR EITHER BRIGHT-LINE RULES OR VAGUE STANDARDS, LEGAL REALISTS WOULD RECOMMEND USING BOTH PRECISE RULES AND INFORMATIVE STANDARDS FOUNDED ON THE REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE DOCTRINES AT HAND, ENABLING PEOPLE TO PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF FUTURE CONTINGENCIES AND TO PLAN AND STRUCTURE THEIR LIVES ACCORDINGLY. LEGAL REALISTS WOULD LIKEWISE AVOID BINARY INSTITUTIONAL CHOICES AND, IN MANY CONTEXTS, APPRECIATE THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF BOTH LEGISLATURES AND COURTS - IN TERMS OF BOTH EXPECTED PERFORMANCE AND LEGITIMACY - AS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW.
817	THIS PART OF THE SURVEY COVERS MATERIALS REFLECTING CHINESE PRACTICE IN 2007 RELATING TO VII. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW (RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL; RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES; RACIAL DISCRIMINATION; DEATH PENALTY; RE-EDUCATION THROUGH LABOUR; ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS; WOMEN'S RIGHTS; RIGHTS OF THE CHILD; RIGHTS OF THE OLDER PERSONS; DIALOGUE ON HUMAN RIGHTS; HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL; IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS); VIII.

818	IN PRINTZ V. UNITED STATES, A NARROW, MAJORITY OF THE SUPREME COURT CONTINUED THE REVIVAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL FEDERALISM AS A CONSTRAINT ON NATIONAL POWER BEGUN IN NEW YORK V. UNITED STATES. PROFESSOR JACKSON CONCLUDES THAT PRINTZ'S CATEGORICAL RULE PROHIBITING FEDERAL DIRECTIVES TO STATE EMPLOYEES IS NOT WELL SUPPORTED BY HISTORICAL OR FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS BUT ARGUES THAT COURTS SHOULD ENFORCE MILDER FEDERALISM-BASED LIMITS ON NATIONAL LEGISLATION JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT SERVES RULE OF LAW PURPOSES, INSISTING THAT CONGRESS RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS CONSTRAINED BY LAW, AND REINFORCES THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF THE STATES. ALTHOUGH VALUES SUCH AS LIBERTY, PARTICIPATION, COMPETITION, AND CHOICE CAN BE PROMOTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES BY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, SECURING THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF STATES HELPS PRESERVE THEIR GOVERNMENTS AS ALTERNATIVE LOCATIONS OF POWER AND POLITICS IN WHICH MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS CAN PARTICIPATE, CROSSING OVER OTHERWISE IMPORTANT CLEAVAGES. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF TWO KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS IS APPROPRIATE:FIRST, WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL REGULATION OF PRIVATE ACTIVITY AS IN LOPEZ V. UNITED STATES, THAT THERE BE A CONSIDERED CONNECTION, CONSISTENT WITH THE NECESSARY AND PROPER CLAUSE, BETWEEN THE LEGISLATION AND AN ENUMERATED POWER; SECOND, THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT INTERFERE WITH THE STATES' CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS , AN UNDERSTANDING THAT SUPPORTS A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST LEGISLATIVE CONLMCOMMANDEERING,AND CALLS FOR A MOVE NUANCED APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE COMMANDEERING THAN IN PRINTZ. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT STABILITY IN SUSTAINING A SUFFICIENTLY PRINCIPLED LATE, OF FEDERALISM-BASED LIMITS ON NATIONAL POURER CAN BE BETTER ACHIEVED WITH MORE FLEXIBLE (RATHER THEN CATEGORICAL) STANDARDS, GIVEN THE DYNAMIC AND PRAGMATIC CHARACTER OF SUCCESSFUL FEDERALISM.
819	PURPOSE WELL-FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS ARE REPEATEDLY CLAIMED TO ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) BY REDUCING THE COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NONETHELESS, IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT INSTITUTIONS MAY MATTER LESS FOR FDI IN THE PRIMARY SECTOR. THIS STUDY AIMS TO THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS FOR ATTRACTING FDI IN AGRICULTURAL AND IN EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY USES WORLDWIDE COUNTRY AND SECTOR-LEVEL DATA ON INWARD FDI FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2007. THE KEY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION, CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY, ARE MEASURED USING WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND POLITY IV AS DATA SOURCES. FIXED EFFECT PANEL REGRESSION, TOBIT REGRESSION AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS ARE USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS CORROBORATE THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONS FOR AGGREGATE FDI. DISAGGREGATING BY PRIMARY SUBSECTOR, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT AGRICULTURAL FDI, LIKE AGGREGATE FDI, IS ATTRACTED BY INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES SUCH AS RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND DEMOCRACY, WHEREAS EXTRACTIVE FDI IS NOT. THE AUTHORS ALSO FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT CORRUPTION DETERS FDI IN BOTH PRIMARY SUBSECTORS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE AUTHORS TAKE A FIRST STEP TOWARD LINKING THE LARGELY EMPIRICAL INSTITUTIONS-FDI LITERATURE MORE CLOSELY WITH THE ECONOMICS-BASED THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS OF FDI RISK GROUNDED ON A PROPERTY RIGHTS APPROACH, TO DISCUSS ISSUES SUCH AS EFFECTIVE CONTROL RIGHTS OVER INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY VARY BETWEEN SECTORS. THE AUTHORS ALSO EXPLORE A NOVEL IDEA THAT EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES MAY BE LESS SENSITIVE TO INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THE TIME HORIZON IS LIMITED BY THE DEPLETION OF THE RESOURCE, RESULTING IN AN INHERENTLY RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM COMMITMENT TO A HOST-COUNTRY LOCATION.
820	THE INTENTION OF THIS STUDY IS TO LOOK INTO THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOW IN LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, WE USE A PANEL DATA SET OF 28 LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES IN SIX DIFFERENT REGIONS THAT SPAN THE PERIOD FROM 2002 TO 2018. THIS ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED BY USING DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATION (TWO-STEP SYSTEM GMM). LATER, WE USE THRESHOLD ANALYSIS TO CAPTURE HOW THE REACTION OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIES IN TERMS OF GDP PER CAPITA. THE EMPIRICAL OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND REGULATORY QUALITY ENHANCE FDI INFLOW WHILE HIGH RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY MITIGATE IT IN LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES. ON THE CONTRARY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND POLITICAL STABILITY DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FDI. REGULATORY QUALITY HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT INFLOWS OF ALL THE METRICS. SIMILARLY, THRESHOLD ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT REGULATORY QUALITY HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FDI WHEN PER CAPITA GDP OF FDI RECIPIENT NATIONS EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD VALUE OF 7.197, WHILE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FDI WHEN PER CAPITA GDP EXCEEDS THE THRESHOLD VALUE OF 7.776. IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN ATTRACTING FDI, LOWER MIDDLE INCOUTRIES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT HIGH AND LOW INCOME COUNTRIES, THOUGH THE OUTCOME IS LARGELY SIMILAR IN THE THREE SUBGROUPS. ACCORDING TO THE REGIONAL FINDINGS, EACH OF THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MEASURES IS ONLY EFFECTIVE IN THE EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION. IN ADDITION, THRESHOLD ANALYSIS REVEALS HOW INSTITUTIONS RESPOND TO THE IMPACT OF PER CAPITA GDP.
821	MUCH RESEARCH ON CHILDREN'S ORAL HEALTH HAS FOCUSED ON PROXIMAL DETERMINANTS AT THE EXPENSE OF DISTAL (UPSTREAM) FACTORS. YET, SUCH UPSTREAM FACTORS-THE SO-CALLED STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH-PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE. CHILDREN'S LIVES, AND IN TURN THEIR HEALTH, ARE SHAPED BY POLITICS, ECONOMIC FORCES, AND SOCIAL AND PUBLIC POLICIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHILDREN'S CLINICAL (NUMBER OF DECAYED, MISSING, AND FILLED TEETH) AND SELF-REPORTED ORAL HEALTH (ORAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE) AND 4 KEY STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS (GOVERNANCE, MACROECONOMIC POLICY, PUBLIC POLICY, AND SOCIAL POLICY) AS OUTLINED IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S COMMISSION FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FRAMEWORK. SECONDARY DATA ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT USING SUBNATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SAMPLES OF 8- TO 15-Y-OLDS IN 11 COUNTRIES (N = 6,648): AUSTRALIA (372), NEW ZEALAND (THREE SAMPLES; 352, 202, 429), BRUNEI (423), CAMBODIA (423), HONG KONG (542), MALAYSIA (439), THAILAND (261, 506), UNITED KINGDOM (88, 374), GERMANY (1498), MEXICO (335), AND BRAZIL (404). THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE TYPE OF POLITICAL REGIME, AMOUNT OF GOVERNANCE (E.G., RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY), GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, EMPLOYMENT RATIO, INCOME INEQUALITY, TYPE OF WELFARE REGIME, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX, GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON HEALTH, AND OUT-OF-POCKET (PRIVATE) HEALTH EXPENDITURE BY CITIZENS WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDREN'S ORAL HEALTH. THE STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS ACCOUNTED FOR BETWEEN 5% AND 21% OF THE VARIANCE IN CHILDREN'S ORAL HEALTH QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. THESE FINDINGS BRING ATTENTION TO THE UPSTREAM OR STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS AS AN UNDERSTUDIED AREA BUT ONE THAT COULD REAP HUGE REWARDS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DENTISTRY RESEARCH AND THE ORAL HEALTH INEQUALITIES POLICY AGENDA.
822	INDONESIA IS RECOGNIZED AS A NATION GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, PRIMARILY ANCHORED IN THE 1945 CONSTITUTION. THIS FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENT PLACES SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS ON FOSTERING A PEACEFUL SOCIETY WHILE ENSURING EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL CITIZENS CONCERNING STATE OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. CONSEQUENTLY, TO FACILITATE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE COUNTRY, THE INDONESIAN STATE ADMINISTRATION JURISDICTION (SAJ) ASSUMES A PIVOTAL ROLE. THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COURT ORDER DEFIANCE AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF EXECUTION PROCEDURES WITHIN THE INDONESIAN SAJ. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AIM, AN EXTENSIVE JUDICIAL RESEARCH ENDEAVOUR WAS UNDERTAKEN, DRAWING DATA FROM DIVERSE SOURCES. THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH EMPLOYED FOR ADDRESSING THE STUDY'S OBJECTIVES INVOLVED CONTENT ANALYSIS. THIS EXAMINATION ELUCIDATES THAT THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT (SAC) IN INDONESIA HOLDS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADJUDICATING CONFLICTS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND STATE OFFICIALS OR BODIES. NEVERTHELESS, THE SCOPE OF THE INDONESIAN SAJ IS EXPANSIVE, EMPHASIZING THE INTEGRATION OF INNOVATION AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF ITS MANDATES. THE INDONESIAN SAJ CONFRONTS SEVERAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY, SUBOPTIMAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, AND BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF "LAW NO. 51/2009" ON EXECUTION PROCEDURES IS EVIDENT. THESE CHALLENGES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE POPULACE. TO SURMOUNT THESE OBSTACLES, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COURT ORDER DEFIANCE AND THE INFUSION OF PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ARE CONSIDERED INDISPENSABLE. SUCH MEASURES CAN FACILITATE EFFICIENT DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES AND ELEVATE TRANSPARENCY LEVELS. THE STUDY CULMINATES WITH A SET OF VITAL RECOMMENDATIONS AIMED AT OPTIMIZING EXECUTION PROCEDURES WITHIN THE INDONESIAN SAJ.
823	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PHENOMENON OF CORPORATISM, WHICH UNDER THE ADVERSE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE USED BY THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ORGANIZATION. THE AUTHORS DEFINE CORPORATISM OF THE PROFESSIONAL SOCIETY AS A COMBINATION OF HOMOGENOUS INTERESTS, ATTITUDES, TRADITIONS AND VALUES; AND PROVIDE A SOCIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CORPORATE UNITY THROUGH ITS ORGANIZATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS. THE FORMER CONSISTS OF THE PERCEPTION OF THE ORGANIZATION RELIABILITY, THE STAFF'S CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE, SATISFACTION WITH THE FINANCIAL SITUATION (STATIC FEATURES), ESTIMATES OF THE INNOVATIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE COMPANY, AND THE WILLINGNESS TO DEVELOP (DYNAMIC FEATURES). THE BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS INCLUDE STAFF'S VALUES AND PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT FOR CORPORATE MANAGEMENT VERTICAL SOCIAL TIES ARE LESS IMPORTANT THAT THE HORIZONTAL ONES, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND HONESTY, AND THE TEAM UNITY UNDER THE UNSTABLE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THE SAMPLE OF THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE AUTHORS IN 2015 CONSISTED OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS TYPICAL FOR THE SVERDLOVSK REGION: MONO-TOWNS AND MONO-SETTLEMENTS (NIZHNY TAGIL, SEROV), TOWNS AND VILLAGES WITH THE DIFFERENTIATED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES (EKATERINBURG, IRBIT). THE RESULTS OF THE EMPIRICAL STUDY OF CORPORATISM AMONG DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES-INDUSTRIAL WORKERS, SOCIAL SERVICES' AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS' STAFF, INDIVIDUAL ENTREPRENEURS AND AUTHORITIES-REVEALED THE INTERNAL RESOURCES THAT CAN REDUCE TENSIONS ON THE LABOR MARKET. THE RESEARCH DATA CAN BE USEFUL FOR THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CORPORATISM IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF RUSSIA (NOT ONLY INDUSTRIAL AND SIMILAR TO THE URAL REGION, BUT DIFFERING FROM IT BY SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PARAMETERS).
824	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CRIMINAL-LEGAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRIME PROVIDED FOR BY ART. 122 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, IDENTIFIES THE MOST TYPICAL PROBLEMS OF APPLYING THIS RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. THE MAIN PART OF THE WORK IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT OF THE SIGNS OF THE COMPOUNDS PROVIDED FOR BY VARIOUS PARTS OF ART. 122 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. A DIRECT OBJECT OF ENCROACHMENT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED, AS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT DETERMINE THE INADMISSIBILITY OF THE SPREAD OF HIV INFECTION AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF ENSURING THE INVIOLABILITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH. THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS MADE IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS. THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF AN HIV-INFECTED PERSON WITH AN UNDETECTABLE VIRAL LOAD UNDER PART 1 OF ART. 122 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS IMPOSSIBLE, SINCE SUCH A PERSON IS NOT ABLE TO TRANSMIT THE DISEASE TO ANOTHER PERSON. ACCORDING TO THIS NORM, CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF A PERSON WHO HAS CORRECTLY USED PROVEN MEANS OF PREVENTING HIV INFECTION (CONDOMS, PRE-CONTACT PROPHYLAXIS) IS ALSO EXCLUDED. THE ACT PROVIDED FOR IN PART 1 OF ART. 122 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSISTS IN COMMITTING ACTIONS THAT CREATE A REAL AND IMMEDIATE THREAT OF HIV INFECTION OF ANOTHER PERSON, IF THE DISEASE DOES NOT OCCUR DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE CULPRIT. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS CAN BE USED TO PROVE THE INNOCENCE OF A PERSON IN INFECTING ANOTHER PERSON WITH HIV INFECTION.
825	"SPONTANEOUS" URBAN AREAS, I.E. URBAN AREAS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE ABSENCE OF URBAN PLANS OR DEROGATING FROM THE ACTUAL ONES, REPRESENT A LANDSCAPE THAT CHARACTERIZES THE CONTEMPORARY URBANIZATION, ESPECIALLY IN CAMPANIA. THOSE AREAS RAISE ISSUES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT ALSO FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, SINCE THEY ARE AFFECTED BY PROBLEMS WITH THE RULE OF LAW. FROM AN URBAN POINT OF VIEW, THEY CONSTITUTE MONO-FUNCTIONAL AREAS LACKING IN PUBLIC SPACES AND SERVICES THAT THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. THE DRAFTING OF THE MUNICIPAL MASTER PLAN REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY THE DISTINCTIVE ASPECTS OF THESE AREAS AND TO REGULATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, THE OBSERVATION OF THE "IN-BETWEEN CITY" PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO THE PLANNING PROCESS ALLOWS STRESSING AND REASSESSING THE DUALITY BETWEEN PLAN AND THE URBAN DESIGN. IN FACT, THESE SPONTANEOUS URBAN AREAS ARE SUBJECTED TO IMPLEMENTATION PLANS BY THE REGIONAL LEGISLATION OF CAMPANIA. FURTHERMORE, THE EXTENSION AND THE CONFORMATION OF THESE PARTS OF TERRITORY SEEM SUITABLE FOR EXPERIMENTING A NEW FORM OF INTERPLAY BETWEEN URBAN PLAN AND URBAN DESIGN. THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE RESULTS OF A RESEARCH CARRIED OUT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE OF UNIVERSITY OF NAPLES FEDERICO II ABOUT CRUCIAL THEMES OF METROPOLITAN URBAN PLANNING: PARTICULARLY ABOUT POSSIBLE AND EFFICIENT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN URBAN PLAN AND URBAN DESIGN. THE THESIS IS EVALUATED THROUGH THE STUDY CASE OF PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE MUNICIPAL MASTER PLAN OF QUALIANO. THIS TERRITORY SHOWS TYPICAL PROBLEMS, VULNERABILITIES AND NECESSITIES OF "SPONTANEOUS" URBAN AREAS. MOREOVER, THE RESEARCH AIMS TO CREATE A PLANNING MODEL FOR THESE AREAS THAT ALSO CHARACTERIZE MEDITERRANEAN METROPOLITAN AREAS. [GRAPHICS]
826	BUSINESS ENTITIES PLAY IMPORTANT AND UNDERAPPRECIATED ROLES IN THE PRODUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. AT THE SAME TIME, INTERNATIONAL TREATY LAW IS HOBBLED BY STATE CENTRIC PRESUMPTIONS THAT RENDER ITS RESPONSE TO BUSINESS AD HOC AND UNPRINCIPLED. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THREE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, IT DRAWS FROM CASE STUDIES TO DEMONSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN TREATY PRODUCTION. THE DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT INVITES A SHIFT FROM ATTENTION TO TRADITIONAL LOBBYING AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL AND PRIVATE STANDARD-SETTING AT THE TRANSNATIONAL LEVEL TO THE WAYS BUSINESS ENTITIES HAVE BECOME AUTONOMOUS INTERNATIONAL ACTORS, USING A PANOPLY OF MEANS TO TRANSFORM THEIR PREFERRED POLICIES INTO LAW. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE DESCRIPTIVE FACTS, IDENTIFYING AN IMPORTANT SET OF QUESTIONS RAISED BY BUSINESS ROLES IN TREATY PRODUCTION. SPECIFICALLY, BUSINESS PARTICIPATION COULD AFFECT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF TREATIES ALONG A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AXES THAT THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES: PARTICIPATION, PROCESS, SUBSTANCE, AND COMPLIANCE. THIRD, OBSERVING THAT SCHOLARS AND LAWMAKERS COULD SEIZE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DESIGN A THEORETICALLY PRINCIPLED LEGAL RESPONSE TO BUSINESS ROLES IN TREATY PRODUCTION, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES BOTH POTENTIAL LEGAL STRUCTURES AND REASONS WHY LAW IN THIS ARENA COULD BE BENEFICIAL. AMONG OTHER REASONS, LAW COULD FACILITATE TREATY EFFECTIVENESS ALONG THE DIMENSIONS THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES; ENHANCE TREATY LEGITIMACY BY ENSURING THAT DECISIONMAKERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS; AND FOSTER RULE OF LAW VALUES SUCH AS CERTAINTY AND PROCEDURAL STABILITY, WHICH COULD AID PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTICIPANTS ALIKE. ULTIMATELY, THE FACTS THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES PRESENT A CHOICE: INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO BUSINESS ROLES IN TREATY PRODUCTION, OR IT CAN LET THOSE ROLES EVOLVE AS THEY WILL, WITH UNCERTAIN AND POSSIBLY ENDURING RESULTS.
827	THIS ARTICLE EXPOUNDS THE COMPOSITE THEORY TO DEFINE THE PARAMETERS FOR THE EXERCISE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN AFRICA, INFORMED BY ITS POLITICAL, HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPRESSED IN THE DAR ES SALAAM DECLARATION ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ACADEMICS AND THE KAMPALA DECLARATION ON INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THIS APPROACH FOLLOWS IN THE LINE OF THE SPECIAL THEORY AND GENERAL THEORY POSTULATED TO JUSTIFY THE EXERCISE AND APPLICATION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPOSITE THEORY CONTENDS THAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN THE AFRICAN CONTEXT SHOULD NOT ONLY BE SEEN IN THE NARROW PRISM OF PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ACADEMICS ON AND OFF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. IT INCLUDES A COMMITMENT TO RECOGNISE AND CONTRIBUTE TO PROMOTING THE RIGHTS OF OTHER KEY ACTORS IN THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM EQUATION, TO WIT, STUDENTS AND THE SOCIETY AS A FULFILMENT OF THE ACADEMIC'S SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THIS ROLE CAN BE FULFILLED BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. INTERNALLY, ACADEMICS SHALL RESPECT STUDENTS' RIGHT TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND IMMERSE KNOWLEDGE-SHARING IN A DEMOCRATIC ETHOS. THIS APPROACH WILL LIKELY INSTIL IN THE STUDENTS RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH THEY WILL CARRY AWAY WITH THEM FROM THE UNIVERSITY INTO LIFE WITHIN THE SOCIETY. EXTRAMURALLY, EQUIPPED WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE, AFRICAN ACADEMICS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PRIVILEGED POSITIONS IN SOCIETY TO LEAVE THEIR IVORY TOWERS AND, WHERE NECESSARY, SOLIDARISE WITH OTHER CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS TO PROMOTE SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION AND HUMAN EMANCIPATION. THIS IS THE GUARANTEED WAY TO PROTECT ACADEMIC FREEDOM ON THE CAMPUSES.
828	BECAUSE OF CHINA'S ENORMOUS AND FAST-GROWING ECONOMY AND ITS INCREASING ROLE IN SHAPING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, THE EVOLVING RULE OF LAW SYSTEM IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC POSES SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN OUR ERA. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES A FEATURE OF THE PRIVATE LAW SYSTEM WHICH HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES ALONGSIDE ARGUABLY INSTEAD OF A RELIABLE PUBLIC ORDER FOR RESOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTES. IT DOES SO BY FOCUSING ON THE DECISIONS ISSUED BY CHINA'S PRE-EMINENT ARBITRAL ASSOCIATION THE CHINA INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE ARBITRATION COMMISSION (CIETAC) IN BEIJING. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF CIETAC IN CHINA'S DISPUTE RESOLUTION SYSTEM, DISCUSSING ITS PRACTICES, ITS PROCEDURES AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN REGARDS TO SETTLING DISPUTES WITH FOREIGN PARTIES. IN PARTICULAR, IT UNDERTAKES A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF CIETAC DECISIONS INTERPRETING THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS WHICH HAS BEEN IN EFFECT IN CHINA SINCE JANUARY I, 1988 AND PROVIDES THE DEFAULT SCHEME THAT REGULATES ALL ELIGIBLE INTERNATIONAL SALES OF GOODS TRANSACTIONS AMONG PARTIES. A LEADING AUTHORITY ON LAW IN CHINA HAS ARGUED THAT CIETAC'S PRACTICES NEED SUBSTANTIAL REFORM IF THEY ARE TO ADHERE TO THE STANDARDS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, WE TENTATIVELY CONCLUDE THAT CONCERNS SUCH AS THOSE ABOUT PRO-CHINESE BIAS OR CORRUPTION IN THIS SYSTEM ARE EITHER NOT IN EVIDENCE OR ARE BEING ADDRESSED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GLASS IS HALF FULL AND GENERALLY BECOMING FULLER AT LEAST FOR THE PEACEFUL AND JUST RESOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTES.
829	ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH ON YEN FUH, HIS COMPATIBLE OR FRIENDLY ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHRISTIANITY IS RARELY MENTIONED, WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE SEEN FROM HIS TRANSLATIONS AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE. YEN WAS BORN INTO A TRADITIONAL SCHOLARLY FAMILY AND HE WAS INTERESTED IN THE ART OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY. LIVING IN THE QING-DYNASTY CULTURAL SURROUNDING FREQUENTED BY ANTI-CHRISTIANITY CASES, HE STILL HAD BOWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISSIONARIES AND WAS DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR THOUGHT. YEN'S EIGHT GREAT TRANSLATED BOOKS, WHICH BROUGHT HIM FAME AS A TRANSLATOR, PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TRANSCENDING OF CHINESE SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES YEN'S COMMENTS AND NOTES IN HIS TRANSLATED BOOKS IN WHICH CAN BE SENSED A STRONG MOMENTUM TO DISSEMINATE CHRISTIAN THOUGHT AS A CHANNEL OF HIS POLITICAL PARTICIPATION THROUGH TRANSLATION. THROUGH HIS TRANSLATED BOOKS, YEN INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE MORALITY OF CHINESE PEOPLE, TO ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND TO DISSEMINATE WESTERN THOUGHT IN CHINA. IN DOING TRANSLATION, YEN USED CHINESE SUPERNATURAL DICTIONS, RATHER THAN TRANSLITERATION OR COINAGES, TO TRANSLATE CHRISTIAN SUPERNATURAL ONES. AND HE ADOPTED THE APPROACH OF DOMESTICATION BY USING ELEGANT LITERARY QUOTATIONS INSTEAD OF FOREIGNIZATION TO TRANSLATE BIBLICAL ALLUSIONS. BESIDES, YEN MADE A POINT OF THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF CHRISTIANITY AND HE RECONSTRUCTED MISSIONARIES' OCCASIONAL NEGATIVE IMAGE IN HIS TRANSLATION BY REWRITING THE SOURCE TEXT SO THAT THEY COULD BE WELL LIKED. YEN'S WAS SINCERE IN HIS FEELINGS, INSTEAD OF BEING DIPLOMATIC, AND HIS TRANSLATION APPROACHES WERE IN TUNE WITH HIS SENTIMENTS. THEREFORE, HIS TRANSLATED WORKS ALL REVEAL HIS FRIENDLY ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHRISTIANITY.
830	CORRUPTION, MALADMINISTRATION, NEPOTISM, AND POOR ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE REACHED UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS WITHIN THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS HAS IMPEDED THE SUCCESSFUL AND ADEQUATE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND BY EXTENSION, HAMPERED SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. UNDENIABLY, THE ENTRENCHMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY IS VITAL FOR DEMOCRATIC PURPOSES AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, AFRICA IS REGARDED AS A UNITARY ENTITY COMPOSED OF SYNCHRONIZED AUTONOMOUS STATES AND GOVERNMENTS. AS A RESULT, A STRICT EXAMINATION OF AVAILABLE AND RELEVANT LITERATURE ON THE PROVISION OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN AFRICA WAS APPLIED (WERE A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF LITERATURE IRTES WAS UNDERTAKEN). THE STUDY WAS ABLE TO COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS, CHALLENGES, AND BENEFITS RELATED TO THE INCREASING RATE AT WHICH IS PARTICIPATING IN AFRICA'S GOVERNANCE RELATED ISSUES AND THEIR OVERALL IMPACT. THE STUDY WAS ALSO ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW CIVIL SOCIETY IN AFRICA HAS CONTRIBUTED TO PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE. IT IS, HOWEVER, APPARENT THAT THE INCREASING INVOLVEMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN GOVERNANCE ISSUES RELATES TO TRANSPARENCY, UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION INTER ALIA. THE STUDY ALSO UNCOVERED THAT THE INCREASE IN THE PARTICIPATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON GOVERNANCE AS THEY WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ACT AS WATCHDOGS TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE AND SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC. GOING FORWARD, IT WILL BE IMPERATIVE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY TO WORK HAND IN HAND WITH DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS IN NOT ONLY FIGHTING CORRUPTION AND PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE BUT TO ALSO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND BY EXTENSION POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE AFRICAN CONTINENT.
831	A VAST LITERATURE EXISTS ON ZHU XI'S METAPHYSICAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY; HOWEVER, HIS STATUS AND VIEWS AS A LEGAL THINKER HAVE NOT GARNERED MUCH SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. MOST BROADLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ZHU XI MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE LEGAL PHILOSOPHY -BY INTERTWINING LAW CLOSELY WITH BOTH MORALITY AND HIS METAPHYSICAL VIEWS ON LI (PRINCIPLE), ZHU XI FURTHER EMPOWERED LAW AND ELEVATED ITS IMPORTANCE IN CHINESE SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE WILL FIRST LAY OUT AND ANALYZE ZHU XI'S LEGAL PHILOSOPHY (FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON HIS VIEW ON PUNISHMENTS), SITUATING IT WITHIN HIS BROADER METAPHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY. THEN, ZHU XI'S LEGAL THOUGHT IN PRACTICE, PARTICULARLY HIS VIEWS ON SOME CASES DURING HIS TIME AND ALSO HIS CAREER AS A LOCAL OFFICIAL, WILL BE EXAMINED. ATTENTION WILL ALSO BE GIVEN TO HIS COMMUNITY COMPACTS, WHICH THE PAPER ARGUES SHOULD BE VIEWED AS QUASI-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPLEMENTED AND BUTTRESSED THE FORMAL LEGAL SYSTEM. THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION OF ZHU XI'S LEGAL THOUGHT IN PRACTICE, THIS ARTICLE HOPES TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS CONSISTENCY BETWEEN ZHU XI'S LEGAL PHILOSOPHY IN BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE WILL BRIEFLY ARGUE FOR THE RELEVANCE OF ZHU XI'S LEGAL THOUGHT TODAY IN CHINA'S PROGRAM OF LEGAL REFORM. ULTIMATELY, ZHU XI CAN BE VIEWED AS A MODEL LEGAL THINKER FOR CHINA WHO OFFERED A COMPLETE, TOTAL VISION OF THE PLACE OF LAW IN SOCIETY. ZHU XI'S VIEWS ON LAW CHALLENGE CONTINUED NOTIONS THAT CONFUCIANISM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH A MODERN RULE OF LAW SYSTEM, AND ALSO FURTHER EMPHASIZES THE DEEP ENGAGEMENT NEO-CONFUCIANS HISTORICALLY WANTED TO HAVE WITH ACTUAL POLICY-MAKING AND SOCIETY.
832	THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S 2008 WHITE PAPER ON INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE SIGNALLED WITH A MEASURE OF DEEP CONCERN - THE LIMITS OF MULTICULTURALISM AND ITS ATTENDANT PROBLEMS OF IDENTITY POLITICS, COMMUNAL SEGREGATION, AND THE UNDERMINING OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN CULTURALLY CLOSED COMMUNITIES. THE WHITE PAPER PROPOSED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POLICY OF MULTICULTURALISM WITH A POLICY OF INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE. THE ARTICLE IN RESPONSE REFLECTS ON THE PARADOXICAL NATURE OF ALL DISCURSIVE MODELS OF DIALOGUE, INCLUDING THAT OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, AND SUGGESTS IN ITS PLACE A DRAMATURGICAL MODEL OF DIALOGUE. ALL FORMS OF DIALOGUE THAT RELY ON DISCURSIVE INTERACTION RUN INTO THE PROBLEM OF INCOMMENSURABLE VALUES, PRINCIPLES AND ULTIMATE AUTHORITIES. FROM WEBER AND KELSEN TO CASTORIADIS AND LYOTARD, THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN WELL ASSAYED. IT IS NOT SURMOUNTABLE BY THE LENGTH, RELATIVE INTENSITY OR PRESUMPTIVE CIVILITY OF A DIALOGUE. NEITHER 'WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN' NOR 'OPEN-MINDEDNESS' - LET ALONE 'DEBATE' AND 'ARGUMENT' - CAN SOLVE THE DEEP, DIFFICULT APORIAS OF FUNDAMENTAL VALUE CONFLICTS. NOR CAN APPEALS TO HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THOUGH THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE BELIEVES OTHERWISE. WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE LIBERAL VALUES OF THESE KINDS ARE ROUTINELY CONTESTED BY MILITANT PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT COMMUNITIES. DIALOGUE CAN MAKE NO SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE TO THIS. WHAT THEN CAN? HISTORICALLY AND STRUCTURALLY, PATRIMONIAL CULTURES ARE ONLY TRANSFORMED UNDER DRAMATURGICAL CONDITIONS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE MODERN SOCIETY OF STRANGERS MOBILIZES ROLE PLAYING, PUBLIC ACTING, DRAMATIC DIALOGISM AND VARIOUS TYPES OF SOCIAL DRAMATURGY (AFFORDED ESPECIALLY BY THE ANONYMOUS THEATRE OF ITS CITIES, MARKETS AND PUBLICS), AND CAUSES THEREBY THE IRONIC INCORPORATION OR ELSE THE GRADUAL WITHERING-AWAY OF PATRIMONIES, PATRIARCHIES AND OTHER KINDS OF PRE-ENLIGHTENMENT COMMUNITIES.
833	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF DEPENDENCY ON FOOD AID PROGRAMMES. FOOD AID MAY TAKE THE FORM OF A LOAN, A SALE BELOW MARKET PRICE OR A CURRENT TRANSFER. FOOD AID PROGRAMMES ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE GENERALLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SHORT-TERM ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, MANY COUNTRIES HAVE DEVELOPED A DEPENDENCE ON FOOD AID ASSISTANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER ESTIMATES CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSIONS USING A DATABASE CONTAINING 116 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1970-2003. BAYESIAN AVERAGING OF CLASSICAL ESTIMATES IS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY THE ROBUST DETERMINANTS OF DEPENDENCY. FINDINGS - THE STUDY FINDS THAT THE TOP TWO DETERMINANTS OF FOOD AID DEPENDENCE (BOTH CEREALS AND NON-CEREALS) WERE FOOD PRODUCTION AND THE FREQUENCY OF DROUGHTS AFFECTING THE COUNTRY. FOOD INFLATION, POPULATION DENSITY, CROP YIELDS, THE AMOUNT OF ARABLE LAND PER CAPITA, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NUMBER OF ARMED CONFLICTS WERE ALSO ROBUSTLY RELATED TO AID DEPENDENCE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTERNATIONAL DONORS SHOULD FOCUS PRIMARILY ON OFFSETTING THE SUBSTITUTION EFFECT OF AID ON LOCAL PRODUCTION AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DROUGHTS, IF THEY ARE TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF DEPENDENCE ON FOOD AID. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER VARIABLES. THE FINDINGS FROM THESE PAPERS WERE SOMEWHAT CONFLICTING DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN MODEL SPECIFICATION. TO IDENTIFY THE VARIABLES THAT HAVE A ROBUST RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD AID DEPENDENCE, WHATEVER THE MODEL SPECIFICATION, THE BAYESIAN AVERAGING OF CLASSICAL ESTIMATES APPROACH PROPOSED BY SALA-I-MARTIN ET AL. IS EMPLOYED.
834	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PAPER THE AUTHOR STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPEDIENT PROCEDURE FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN MODERN STATES. IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH NORMATIVE MECHANISMS THAT WOULD PROTECT THE CITIZENS FROM STALLING IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND COURT PROCEDURES. THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS FROM STALLING OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, I.E., FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE, HAS HAD A PLACE IN CROATIAN LAW FOR A LONG TIME - IT IS REGULATED BY THE LAW ON GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND LAW ON ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTES. AFTER THE TERM ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE HAS BEEN RELATED TO THE WIDER TERMS OF NOT DOING AND NEGLECT OF ADMINISTRATION, THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE IS CONSIDERED WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND PURPOSE OF PROCEDURAL LAW, I.E., TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL SECURITY, EQUALITY, AND JUSTICE. THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE IS CONTRARY TO ALL THE STATED PRINCIPLES. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER BRIEFLY OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTECTION OF CITIZENS FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE IN THE FRENCH, AUSTRIAN, AND CROATIAN LAWS, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN PART OF THE PAPER CONTAINS THE DESCRIPTION OF TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE - THE ONE THAT GIVES CERTAIN IMPORTANCE TO IT, AND THE OTHER THAT DENIES IT ANY IMPORTANCE AT ALL. THUS, BY DESCRIBING SILENCE OF ADMINISTRATION AS AN OCCURRENCE THAT HAS CERTAIN MEANING, THE AUTHOR OUTLINES ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF TWO OPPOSITE FICTIONS - THE POSITIVE ONE AND THE NEGATIVE ONE. HE ALSO DESCRIBES THE PROBLEMS THAT MAY OCCUR IF ADMINISTRATIVE SILENCE IS DENIED ANY IMPORTANCE. IN THE CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR SUPPORTS A CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF NEGATIVE FICTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA.
835	IN THIS PAPER WE ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES (CORRUPTION AND GOVERNANCE), STRUCTURAL VARIABLES (PER CAPITA INCOME, TRADE OPENNESS, INFLATION AND SHARE OF AGRICULTURE IN GDP), AND POLICY VARIABLES (TAX RATE AND TARIFF RATE) ON TOTAL TAX REVENUES, DIRECT TAXES, INDIRECT TAXES AND TRADE TAXES USING PANEL DATA SET FOR 30 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE 1996-2016 PERIOD. ALL ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON FIXED EFFECTS (FE) AND RANDOM EFFECTS (RE) MODELS. USING HAUSMAN TEST, RE IS EARMARKED TO BE THE MORE PREFERRED MODEL IN THIS PAPER. THE RE REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT CORRUPTION AND GOVERNANCE ARE TWO MAIN DETERMINANTS OF TAX REVENUES IN AFRICA. WHILE CORRUPTION HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TAX REVENUES, GOOD GOVERNANCE MEASURED IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TENDS TO RAISE TAX REVENUE GENERATION AND IN PARTICULAR, INDIRECT TAXES. IN THE SAME VEIN, GOVERNANCE IN FORM OF POLITICAL STABILITY TENDS TO HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON DIRECT TAXES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE TAXES. THE BASIC INTUITION BEHIND THESE RESULTS IS THAT HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND LOWER CORRUPTION ENHANCE TAX REVENUE GENERATION IN THE ECONOMY. INTRIGUINGLY, EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT TARIFF RATES TEND TO HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TOTAL TAX REVENUE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE A STRONG POSITIVE EFFECT ON TRADE TAX REVENUE. MOREOVER, TRADE OPENNESS TENDS TO HAVE A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH TAX REVENUE. OVERALL, RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TO RAISE MORE TAX REVENUE, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD REDUCE CORRUPTION, IMPROVE TAX AND CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION AND RAISE REVENUES FROM TAX CATEGORIES THAT ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CORRUPTION. THEY SHOULD AS WELL ENHANCE TRADE OPENNESS.
836	INCREASING WATER DEMAND DUE TO POPULATION GROWTH, IRRIGATION EXPANSION, INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THE NEED FOR ECOSYSTEM IMPROVEMENT UNDER MOUNTING INVESTMENT COSTS FOR DEVELOPING NEW WATER SOURCES CALLS FOR THE EFFICIENT, EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY ESSENTIAL IN THE ARAL SEA BASIN (ASB) WHERE INEFFECTIVE WATER MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE PRIMARY REASON OF INTERSECTORAL AND INTER-STATE WATER SHARING CONFLICTS AND LACK OF INCENTIVES FOR IMPROVING WATER USE EFFICIENCY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED MARKET-BASED WATER ALLOCATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION TO THE TRADITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE ALLOCATION TO DEAL WITH WATER SCARCITY ISSUES IN THE ASB. POTENTIAL ECONOMIC GAINS OF TRADABLE WATER USE RIGHTS WERE ANALYZED BASED ON A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED INTEGRATED HYDRO-ECONOMIC RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT MODEL. THE ANALYSIS DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN INTER-CATCHMENT AND INTRA-CATCHMENT WATER RIGHTS TRADING. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COMPARED TO A BASELINE WITH FIXED WATER USE RIGHTS, INTER-CATCHMENT WATER RIGHTS TRADING CAN INCREASE BASIN-WIDE BENEFITS BY US$ 373-476 MILLION. UNDER INTRA-CATCHMENT TRADING, GAINS ARE STILL US$ 259-339 MILLION, DEPENDING ON RELATIVE WATER AVAILABILITY. GAINS FROM TRADE ARE LARGER UNDER DRIER CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, WATER RIGHTS TRADING CARRIES A SERIES OF TRANSACTION COSTS. WE FIND THAT IN CASE TRANSACTION COSTS EXCEED US$ 0.05/M(3) OF WATER TRADED THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC GAIN FROM WATER RIGHTS TRADING. ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, INFRASTRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS, PARTICIPATION OF REPRESENTATIVES OF KEY WATER STAKEHOLDERS IN DECISION MAKING PROCESSES, AND MUTUAL TRUST AND COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE RIPARIAN COUNTRIES ARE SUGGESTED AS MEANS FOR REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS OF WATER RIGHTS TRADING CONTRACTS.

837	BACKGROUND: IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER INEQUALITIES IN UNDER-5 MORTALITY BY WEALTH IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) ARE GROWING OR DECLINING. METHODS: ALL DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEYS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012 WERE USED TO MEASURE UNDER-5 MORTALITY TRENDS IN 3 WEALTH TERTILES. TWO APPROACHES WERE USED TO ESTIMATE CHANGES IN UNDER-5 MORTALITY: WITHIN-SURVEY CHANGES FROM ALL 54 COUNTRIES, AND BETWEEN-SURVEY CHANGES FOR 29 COUNTRIES WITH REPEATED SURVEY WAVES. THE PRINCIPAL OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE ANNUAL DECLINE IN MORTALITY, AND THE RATIO OF MORTALITY BETWEEN THE POOREST AND LEASTPOOR WEALTH TERTILES. RESULTS: MORTALITY INFORMATION IN 85 SURVEYS FROM 929 224 HOUSEHOLDS AND 1 267 167 WOMEN LIVING IN 54 COUNTRIES WAS USED. IN THE SUBSET OF 29 COUNTRIES WITH REPEAT SURVEYS, MORTALITY DECLINED ANNUALLY BY 4.36, 3.36, AND 2.06 DEATHS PER 1000 LIVE BIRTHS AMONG THE POOREST, MIDDLE, AND LEAST-POOR TERTILES, RESPECTIVELY (P =.031 FOR DIFFERENCE). THE MORTALITY RATIO DECLINED FROM 1.68 TO 1.48 DURING THE STUDY PERIOD (P =.006 FOR TREND). IN THE COMPLETE SET OF 85 SURVEYS, THE MORTALITY RATIO DECLINED IN 64 SURVEYS (FROM 2.11 TO 1.55), AND INCREASED IN 21 SURVEYS (FROM 1.58 TO 1.88). MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT CONVERGENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE (P <=. 03 FOR 4 GOVERNANCE INDICATORS: GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION). CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, UNDER-5 MORTALITY IN LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES HAS DECREASED FASTER AMONG THE POOREST COMPARED WITH THE LEAST POOR BETWEEN 1995 AND 2012, BUT PROGRESS IN SOME COUNTRIES HAS LAGGED, ESPECIALLY WITH POOR GOVERNANCE.
838	PURPOSE - THE FINANCIAL ECONOMICS LITERATURE POINTS TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT TRANSPARENCY AFFECTS THE INFLOWS OF DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY IN AN ECONOMY AND THE LEVEL OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS USING CROSS-SECTION AND TIME SERIES DATA FROM 13 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES FROM 1998 THROUGH 2008. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER EMPLOYED A PANEL UNIT ROOT AND PANEL COINTEGRATION TESTS TO DATA FROM 13 SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES FROM 1998 THROUGH 2008. THE LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP IS ESTIMATED BY THE FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (FMOLS) METHOD. THE COINTEGRATION FRAMEWORK EMPLOYED IN THIS STUDY ACCOUNTS FOR INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS TIME EFFECTS BY ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY AND SERIAL CORRELATION EXISTING IN THE DATA PANEL. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND SIZE OF FDI INFLOWS INTO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAVE A LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE ROLE OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN INCREASING THE LEVELS OF CORRUPTION IN HOST COUNTRIES IS SUPPORTED IN THIS STUDY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE ROLE OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE ABSENCE OF TRANSACTIONAL TRANSPARENCY IN HOST COUNTRIES IS SUPPORTED IN THIS STUDY. THE OECD CONVENTION ON COMBATING BRIBERY OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE ENDORSED BY AFRICAN COUNTRIES. AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHOULD MAKE EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM THEIR DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND ALLOW RULE OF LAW TO APPLY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER IS THE FIRST TO EMPIRICALLY TEST THE AFOREMENTIONED LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP BY ISOLATING THE ROLE OF TRANSPARENCY IN INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS.
839	THIS ARTICLE ANSWERS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHY WERE INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM NOT INVENTED IN THE ORIENT BUT IN OCCIDENT? IT UPHOLDS THAT CHRISTIANITY PREDISPOSED THE WEST TO DISCOVER INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM WHEN ISLAM DIDN'T. IN THE FIRST SECTION IT EXPLAINS THE DECLINE AND ECONOMIC RISE OF THE ORIENT AND OCCIDENT AS DERIVED FROM KANT'S HYPOTHESIS (2.1) AND GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS (2.2). IT EXPLAINS IN THE SECOND SECTION THE INVENTION OF INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM IN EUROPE BY TWO MORAL INNOVATIONS: THE SECULARISING OF LAW AND THE INVENTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL (3). THE SECULARISING OF LAW WAS THE RESULT OF CHRISTIAN PROPERTY THEOLOGY WHICH RECOGNISED MAN'S PLACE IN GOD'S CREATION (3.1). SECULARISING OF POLITICS AND THE CHRISTIANS' DESIRE FOR AUTONOMY VIS-A -VIS POLITICAL AUTHORITIES ORIGINATED IN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS BEING CONCEIVED AS NORMAL AND INCITED MAN TO INSIST UPON RESPECT FROM PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THE ADVENT OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WAS AT THE ORIGIN OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SECULAR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT APPLYING TO ALL MEN, EVEN THE SOVEREIGN (3.2). THE THIRD SECTION EXPLAINS WHY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISLAM DID NOT PREDISPOSE MUSLIMS TO DISCOVER THE INSTITUTIONS OF FREEDOM, CAPITALISM. ISLAMIC LAW DISTANCED THE ORIENT FROM CAPITALISM AS IT DEVELOPED A RELIGION OF COMMUNITY SALVATION HOSTILE TO INDIVIDUALISM AND ITS RIGHTS (4.1); IT NEVER DISASSOCIATED THE RULE OF GOD FROM THE RULE OF LAW (4.2) AND IT DID NOT CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS SACRED OR PRIVATE PROPERTY (4.3). THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH THE WAY IN WHICH ECONOMIC THEORY COULD CONCEIVE OF THE RELIGION VARIABLE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT (5).
840	ACCORDING TO THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE, THE MOST WIDELY USED ESTIMATE IS THAT APPROXIMATELY 300,000 CHILDREN ARE PART OF REGULAR AND IRREGULAR ARMIES WORLDWIDE, EITHER AS COMBATANTS OR AS SUPPORT PERSONNEL. MOREOVER, MOST SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT THEIR NUMBERS ARE GROWING. HOWEVER, THE TRUTH IS THAT NO ONE REALLY KNOWS THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF CHILD SOLDIERS FIGHTING IN SOME SEVENTY-TWO GOVERNMENT OR REBEL FORCES IN ABOUT TWENTY COUNTRIES. THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE FIELD WORK ON THIS SUBJECT IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT. AND AS IT IS IN BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW TO ENGAGE A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS, REGULAR ARMIES AND GUERRILLA FORCES ARE HARDLY GOING TO PUBLICIZE THE NUMBER OF CHILD SOLDIERS IN THEIR RANKS. WHATEVER THE TRUE NUMBER OF CHILD SOLDIERS MAY BE, THE FACT REMAINS THAT CHILD SOLDIERS HAVE BECOME A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT OF MILITARY FORCES ACROSS AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. FOR AFRICA ALONE, ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE 120,000 CHILDREN, 40 PER CENT OF ALL CHILD SOLDIERS. MOREOVER, NOT ONLY HAS AFRICA EXPERIENCED THE FASTEST GROWTH IN THE USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS, BUT THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE CHILDREN ENLISTED IN SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES IS DECLINING AS WELL. AND THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES THAT PROHIBIT THE USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS. SUCCESSFULLY BRINGING PEACE, SECURITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE KIVU PROVINCES, IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC), WILL BE A MASSIVE CHALLENGE THAT WILL REQUIRE DOMESTIC AND REGIONAL MEASURES IMPLEMENTED OVER PROBABLY SEVERAL YEARS. THIS WILL NECESSITATE THE CONTINUED ACTIVE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
841	EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE IS AN INFORMAL ACQUIS CONSISTING OF THE STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES THAT REGULATE THE ORGANISATION, FUNCTIONING, AND ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE ISSUE OF CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE BECAME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PARALLEL WITH STRENGTHENING OF THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT CONTRADICTORY TO THE CLAIMS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS SHOW REMARKABLE RESISTANCE. THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CONVERGE TOWARDS A COMMON ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL CHARACTERISED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, MEANING LEGAL CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS; OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY; ACCOUNTABILITY; EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES AND EFFECTIVENESS IN ACCOMPLISHING THE POLICY GOALS. THE ACTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE, TOGETHER WITH THE FORMULATION OF THE ACCESSION CRITERIA FOR CANDIDATE COUNTRIES AND STIMULATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS ORIENTED TOWARDS STRENGTHENING OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. THE CONTACTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL AND THE INFLUENCE OF GLOBALISATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE DOCTRINES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR MUTUAL "INFECTIONO" OF NATIONAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS. SIGMA HAS A SPECIAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EAS CONCEPT. HARMONISATION AND CONVERGENCE OF NATIONAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS, WITH SIMULTANEOUS RETENTION OF NATIONAL TRADITIONS, LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BEGINNINGS OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE REALLY EXIST. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO DISCERN THE FORMATION OF A COMPLEX AND MINUTELY DEVELOPED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MODEL THAT OUGHT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES AND CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE A SET OF RULES AND STANDARDS WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING CORPUS.
842	FEDERALISM, FROM ONE TURN, DOES MAINTAIN MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPRESSION AND PROMOTING OF LEGITIMATE REGIONAL INTERESTS. HOWEVER, FROM OTHER SIDE, FEDERAL FORM OF STATE ORGANIZATION APPEARS TO BE A SOLID FACTOR THAT LIMITS CONSIDERABLY A FREEDOM OF ACTIONS OF THE CENTRAL POWER THAT IT IS OBLIGED TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT OVERALL NATIONAL INTERESTS WITHIN THE STATE AND BEYOND OF ITS FRONTIERS. IN THE MODERN WORLD, CANADIAN FEDERALISM IS ONE FROM MOST FAMOUS AND RESPECTABLE STATE REGIMES. UNDER FEDERAL BANNER CANADA PASSED SEVERAL STAGES OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHILE DEMONSTRATING UNDISPUTABLE CAPABILITY FOR EVOLUTION AND ADAPTATION TOWARDS CONSTANTLY CHANGING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FORMERLY A HIGHLY CENTRALIZED STATE, CANADA HAS TRANSFORMED ITSELF PEACEFULLY INTO A DECENTRALIZED POWER WITHIN AN OLD CONSTITUTIONAL ACT. ONE OF THE ISSUES STANDING PERPETUALLY IN FRONT OF LEVELS OF POWERS IS POLICY OF ITS ABUNDANT NATURAL RESOURCES. THE SUBJECT OF ARTICLE IS A RESEARCH OF WAYS AND MEANS OF COOPERATION AND CONFRONTATION BETWEEN CENTER AND PERIPHERY OVER MANAGEMENT OF THESE RESOURCES. THE STUDY IS BASED OF THE METHODOLOGY: FORMAL LEGAL HISTORICAL, SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DIALECTICAL ONE. FROM EVALUATION OF FLEXIBLE LEADERSHIP OVER THE FIELD, AUTHOR MAKES A CONCLUSION ABOUT GREAT MEASURE OF EFFICIENCY IN THE LEADING A HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED FEDERATION ON THE BASE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CLEAR-CUT POLITICAL WILL COMPLETELY LOYAL TO ALL EXISTING LEGAL LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS AND BRIGHT CADRES CAPABLE TO IMPLEMENT SKILLFULLY AND DECISIVELY EVERY LEGITIMATE WAY FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE. ONLY SUCH MODEL OF STATE LEADERSHIP HAVE A FUTURE IN THE MODERN CIVILIZATION. THEREFORE THE DEMOCRATIC WAYS AND MEANS, ELABORATED BY CANADIAN SOCIAL FABRIC AND STATE BODIES, DO DESERVE STRONG ATTENTION OF THE RUSSIAN EXPLORERS AND PRACTITIONERS.
843	THIS PAPER SITUATES THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT IN A WIDER TEMPORAL AND IDEOLOGICAL FRAME OF REFERENCE AS AN ANTICOLONIAL PROJECT AND ASKS WHAT THE POSTCOLONIAL CRITIQUE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT AND THE POSTCOLONIAL STATE CAN OFFER TO DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CONTEMPORARY FORMS OF CRUELTY AND INJUSTICE IN THE FORM OF INEQUALITY AND MISRECOGNITION. IT IDENTIFIES THE LIMITS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGALISM' AND IS CRITICAL OF THE TRIUMPHALIST' MODE OF APPRECIATING THE CONSTITUTION. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGALISM POSTULATES A TEXT THAT CONTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE THAT AWAITS IMPLEMENTATION AND HAS SETTLED ALL RELEVANT QUESTIONS ARISING FROM OUR COLONIAL PAST. INSTEAD, THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE CONCEIVED AS AN INCOMPLETELY THEORISED AGREEMENT' WHICH DEFERRED MANY QUESTIONS AND WHICH CONCEALS MANY ONGOING DISAGREEMENTS. BUT THIS PAPER ALSO RECOGNISES THE CONSTITUTION AND ITS CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS - HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND POPULAR SELF-GOVERNMENT AS GENUINE ANTICOLONIAL ACHIEVEMENTS, WHICH PROVIDE FRAMEWORK CONCEPTS AND INSTITUTIONS FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. SO THE PAPER IS ALSO CRITICAL OF THE CULTURALIST' CRITIQUE THAT DENOUNCES THE CONSTITUTION AS A BETRAYAL' THAT INSCRIBES EUROCENTRIC FORMS OF REASON AS A PERMANENT OBSTACLE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF A GENUINELY POSTCOLONIAL SOCIETY. IT PROPOSES, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH THE LEGALIST' DEFENCE AND CULTURALIST' CRITIQUE THAT THE IDEA OF THE DEMOS' SHOULD BE RESTORED TO ITS CENTRAL PLACE IN THE IMAGINARY OF SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE CONSTITUTION CAN THEN BE RECONCEIVED NOT AS THE PERFECT PRODUCT OF A SINGULAR MOMENT IN SOUTH AFRICAN HISTORY BUT AS AN ONGOING ACTIVITY REQUIRING DIALOGUE, INCLUDING INTER-GENERATIONAL DIALOGUE, AND A DEMOCRATIC FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH TO STRIVE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE.
844	THE POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR THIS ARTICLE IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AN ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MODERNITY AND AN IDEA UNDERLYING THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT, PARALLEL TO IDEAS ON PROGRESS, WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF IDEOLOGIES WHOSE AMBITION IT WAS TO REDUCE PREEXISTING DIVERSITY, IN A POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SENSE, ALTHOUGH THIS PROCESS WAS NOT FREE FROM CONTRADICTION. THE MOST PATENT REFLECTION OF THIS WAS IN THE TENSION BETWEEN MECHANISMS OF REPRESENTATION AND PARTICIPATION. IN A CERTAIN SENSE, THIS PHASE CULMINATED IN THE SOCIAL STATE, IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE COLD WAR. WITH THE CULMINATION OF THE LATTER AND THE CRISIS OF THE FORMER, THE STAGE OF GLOBALIZATION, BARELY UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF ITS POLITICAL EFFECTS ON DEMOCRACIES, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY THE DISSEMINATION OF A LEVEL OF ECONOMIC, IDENTITY-BASED, AND SOCIAL COMPLEXITY HITHERTO UNKNOWN. SUCH COMPLEXITY BROKE DOWN PREVIOUSLY HELD CERTAINTIES AND, IN THE MIDST OF AN EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF UNCERTAINTY, REPLACED THEM WITH AN UNSTABLE BALANCE BETWEEN EUPHORIA AND FEAR, AS THE SOCIAL EXPERIENCES HAVING THE GREATEST DISSEMINATION. THE PRESERVATION OF THAT BALANCE IS MAKING IT NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT NEO-AUTHORITARIAN MECHANISMS, WITH THE CONSEQUENT DECLINE IN SOME VALUES OF THE SOCIAL STATE, OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE THAT ABIDES BY THE RULE OF LAW. ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS IS THE WEAKNESS OF THE OLD PARTICIPATION/REPRESENTATION DIALECTIC, WHICH IS HAVING NEGATIVE EFFECTS, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE PRESTIGE OF POLITICAL PARTIES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, IT SEEMS THAT A PERIOD OF NEW FORMS OF PARTICIPATION AND DYNAMIZATION OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS MAY OPEN, AS LONG AS THERE IS COMPLIANCE WITH SOME PRAGMATIC, STANDARDS-RELATED PREMISES THAT THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN.
845	THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT A CHALLENGE EXISTS IN DEFLECTING THE PREVAILING VIEW THAT A GENERAL GAP OF LEGAL APPLICABILITY EXISTS IN RESPECT OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE WAR ON TERROR. THIS " GAP " IS ARTICULATED BY A FOCUS ON A NEW PHENOMENA-NAMELY THE EMERGENCE OF AL QAEDA AS A NONNATIONALLY MOTIVATED, TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WHOSE ACTIONS AND ACTORS DO NOT " FIT" EXISTING LEGAL NORMS AND SANCTIONS. IN ADDRESSING THAT CHALLENGE, THIS ARTICLE WILL REBUT THE ARGUMENT THAT SUGGESTS A LEGAL LACUNA EXISTS, AND THAT NO APPROPRIATE LEGAL TOOLS ARE AVAILABLE TO STATES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY CONFRONT THE POST SEPTEMBER IITH CONTEXT. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARGUMENT ASSERTS THAT EXISTING LEGAL NORMS PROVIDE SUFFICIENT COVERAGE TO RESPOND TO THE CONFLICTS EXPERIENCED IN THE CONTEMPORARY MOMENT, AS WELL AS TO THE STATE AND NON-STATE ENTITIES PARTICIPATING IN THEM. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT CLARITY ABOUT THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE LEGAL REGIME OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW WOULD ASSIST CLOSING OFF PERCEIVED REGULATORY GAPS. IT CONTENDS THAT THE USUAL RATIONALE GIVEN IN FAVOR OF PARALLEL APPLICATION, NAMELY HIGHER PROTECTION FOR THE VICTIMS OF CONFLICT, SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERESTIMATES ITS OTHER VALUABLE POLICY AND INSTRUMENTAL BENEFITS. SPECIFICALLY, THE TRADITIONALLY VAUNTED VICTIM CENTERED RATIONALE DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY WEIGH THE VALUE OF AFFIRMING CONSISTENT RULE OF LAW COVERAGE TO SITUATIONS OF CONFLICT. THE ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT WHILE FURTHER REGULATORY MEASURES MAY BE POSSIBLE AND EVEN DESIRABLE TO CONFRONT THE CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES OF CONFLICT FORMS (INCLUDING TERRORISM), A COMBINED OR DYNAMIC APPROACH TO THE LAW OF WAR AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW PROVIDES SUFFICIENT TRACTION AND NORM CONTENT TO ADDRESS AND BE RELEVANT TO PRESENT NEEDS.
846	IN MARCH 2002 PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF WHAT MANY INSIDERS HAVE HERALDED AS A REVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE: THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE ACCOUNT (MCA). THE LATTER SEEKS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO 79 OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES - MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN OFTEN EQUATED WITH THE TERM 'FAILED STATES' - SO THAT THEY MAY REAP THE BENEFITS OF NEOLIBERAL-LED GLOBALISATION. ONE OF THE MOST NOVEL, AND COERCIVE, FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT COMPACT IS THE 'PRE-EMPTIVE' METHOD IN WHICH IT WILL ADMINISTER AID. UNDER THE MCA, ONLY COUNTRIES THAT GOVERN JUSTLY, INVEST IN THEIR PEOPLE, AND OPEN THEIR ECONOMIES TO FOREIGN ENTERPRISE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP WILL QUALIFY FOR FUNDING. TO THIS END THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS DEVISED 16 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA - RANGING FROM CIVIL LIBERTIES TO 'DAYS TO START A BUSINESS' - THAT EACH COUNTRY MUST SUCCESSFULLY PASS BEFORE RECEIVING AID. DESPITE ITS IMPACT ON NORMALISING, AND THUS LEGITIMATING, THE TENDENCY TOWARDS THE PRIVATISATION OF AID AND MILITARISATION OF DEVELOPMENT, THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE CRITICAL WORK ON THE MCA. THIS PAPER SETS OUT TO FILL THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE BY ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND HISTORICALLY THE MCA AS A MOMENT OF AMERICAN EMPIRE. 1 IN DOING SO, I SUGGEST THAT, WHILE THE FORM OF THE MCA REPRESENTS AN UNABASHED ARTICULATION OF US-LED IMPERIALISM VIS-A-VIS THE POOREST REGIONS IN THE SOUTH, THE CONTENT OF THIS ALLEGEDLY NOVEL STRATEGY REFLECTS THE SAME GOALS AND INTERESTS THAT UNDERLIE THE NEOLIBERAL AGENDA, NAMELY, THAT THE PATH TO INCREASED GROWTH AND PROSPERITY LIES IN COUNTRIES' WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO ADOPT POLICIES THAT PROMOTE ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW.
847	THE CONCEPT OF "POLITICAL RIGHTS" OF A PERSON AND A CITIZEN, WIDELY USED TODAY, IS IN FACT FAR FROM CERTAIN, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC RIGHTS THAT IT IS GENERALLY CUSTOMARY TO INCLUDE IN ITS CONTENT AND IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC POWERS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE THE CONTENT OF THESE RIGHTS. IN THIS REGARD, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES POLITICAL RIGHTS THEMSELVES, WHICH THE AUTHOR FINDS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH FROM HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE SOCIO-POLITICAL SPHERE. THE LATTER INCLUDE FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, THE RIGHT TO PETITION, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, THE RIGHT TO UNITE, ETC. CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE SUBSTANTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF POLITICAL RIGHTS: THUS, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT "PARTICIPATION IN STATE AFFAIRS" ALTHOUGH IT IS NAMED AS A RIGHT IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CANNOT CLAIM THE ROLE OF REAL AND CURRENT SUBJECTIVE PUBLIC LAW. TRANSFORMATIONS OF CLASSICAL POLITICAL RIGHTS ENSURING THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN POWER IN MODERN POLITICAL AND LEGAL DISCOURSE ARE ANALYZED. THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPT OF NATIONAL REPRESENTATION AND CONSTITUENT POWER ARE CONSIDERED. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT EVEN WITH THE MOST ADEQUATE AND AUTHENTIC MECHANISMS FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO POPULAR REPRESENTATION, SUCH POWER NEVER BELONGS FULLY TO THE PEOPLE. THE ARTICLE JUSTIFIES THAT THE NATURAL POLITICAL RIGHT IS THE RIGHT TO REVOLT ("THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE", "THE RIGHT TO REVOLUTION"). THE NATURAL POLITICAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE "TO REVOLT" ACQUIRES THE CHARACTERISTIC OF PRECISELY "RIGHT", AND NOT A BARE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY ONLY IF THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS OF LEGITIMIZATION AND SUBSEQUENT LEGALIZATION. AS A RESULT, THE RIGHT AT THE PRESENT STAGE WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS THE RIGHT TO A LEGITIMATE RULE OF LAW.
848	ECONOMIC OBJECTS ARE OBJECTS WHICH ARE PRODUCED BY EMPLOYING INPUTS AND VALUED BY APPLYING A VALUATION PROCEDURE. IN A MARKET ECONOMY THE VALUATION IS PERFORMED BY THE PRICE MECHANISM. IDEALLY MARKET PRICES REFLECT THE SCARCITY VALUES CORRESPONDING TO INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS CALL THE SEPARATION OF PRODUCTION AND VALUATION INTO QUESTION AND THEREBY CHALLENGE THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE MARKET ECONOMY. IN PARTICULAR THE FINANCE AND DATA INDUSTRY TURNS BELIEFS AND PREFERENCES FROM EXOGENOUS INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS INTO PRODUCED OBJECTS. AS A RESULT, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SHIFTS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF OBJECTS TO THE PRODUCTION OF VALUES AND PRICES. THE PAPER ADOPTS A CLASSICAL PERSPECTIVE AND USES THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION SCHEME TO OUTLINE A MODEL OF THE SMART ECONOMY. A SMART ECONOMY IS AN INTERNET-BASED ECONOMY WHICH EMPLOYS (ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT) ROBOTS TO PRODUCE SENSOR-ENABLED OBJECTS VIA WHICH THE BEHAVIOR OF CONSUMERS CAN BE TRACKED AND DIRECTED. THE ROBOTS ARE OWNED BY CAPITAL-OWNERS WHO EMPLOY AGENTS FOR DEVELOPING THE ROBOTS, DESIGNING DATA-BASED DEVICES AND BUSINESS MODELS, MANAGING THEM, AND FINANCING THEM. THE OWNERS AND THEIR AGENTS EMPLOY WORKERS TO COMPLEMENT ROBOTS AND TO PROVIDE PERSONAL SERVICES. THE PAPER PROPOSES INVESTING MORE INTO THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF CONSUMER SOVEREIGNTY, ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, AND THE RES PUBLICA, IN ORDER TO AVOID A DYSTOPIC BRAVE NEW WORLD. THE AUTHOR SKETCHES AN AGENDA FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BY CONFRONTING THE SMART ECONOMY WITH CORE CONCEPTS OF EUROPEAN ENLIGHTENMENT: SECULARIZATION, CONSTITUTION AND RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS, NATION STATE, EDUCATION, AND MARKET ORDER.
849	THE ORIGINAL QUESTION IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS IN KIOBEL WAS WHETHER MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES COULD BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THE ALIEN TORT STATUTE (ATS). BUT THE FOCUS OF PROCEEDINGS SOON SHIFTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER THE STATUTE WAS INTENDED TO COVER ANY FOREIGN DEFENDANT'S ALLEGED CRIMES ABROAD. RATHER THAN ENGAGING DIRECTLY WITH THE ISSUE OF THE CORPORATE ENTITY, THE FINAL DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT CHALLENGED THE TRANSNATIONAL FEATURES ATTRIBUTED TO THE ATS LITIGATION FRAMEWORK AT LEAST SINCE FILARTIGA, AND SOUGHT TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF JURISDICTION OF AMERICAN COURTS IN SUCH CASES. SINCE THE 1990S, ATS JURISPRUDENCE HAS EVOLVED INTO A CENTRAL PILLAR IN THE REGULATION OF TRANSNATIONAL BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE PLACES THIS JURISPRUDENCE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE MAIN REGULATORY PARADIGMS WITHIN WHICH THE QUESTION OF CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW IS USUALLY ADDRESSED, NAMELY, THE STATIST, THE UNIVERSALIST, AND TRANSNATIONAL PRIVATE REGULATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT WHILE KIOBEL MAY MARK THE DEMISE OF A ROBUST UNIVERSALIST POSITION ARTICULATED IN AMERICAN TERMS, IT NEVERTHELESS OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF ADJUDICATION OF TRANSNATIONAL VIOLATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW OVER A MUCH BROADER SET OF CONCERNS THROUGH THE USE OF REGULAR TORTS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT OF A PLURALITY OF ACTORS THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STATE JURISDICTION BY A VARIETY OF DOMESTIC COURTS WORKING ALONGSIDE MULTIPLE MECHANISMS OF TRANSNATIONAL PRIVATE REGULATION. THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE KIOBEL MOMENT ALLOWS US ALSO TO (RE-) CONSIDER THE ROLE OF STRONG, MOSTLY AMERICAN, ACTORS - BE IT THE ADMINISTRATION, THE COURTS, CORPORATIONS OR OTHER AGENTS - IN INTERNATIONAL POWER RELATIONS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC REGULATION.
850	CONCEPTS ARE NOT VAGUE BY LACK OF DEFINITION. ANY CONCEPT BEARS ITS MEANING, ITS COMPREHENSION. THEY WILL BE SAID TO BE VAGUE WHEN THEIR EXTENSION IS NOT WELL DELIMITED, WHEN THEIR REFERENTS ARE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED, THUS WHEN THEIR CONTENTS VARY. THE LEGISLATOR WHO CHOOSES TO ADOPT A VAGUE CONCEPT TO LAY THE RULE OF LAW ACKNOWLEDGES THE INDETERMINACY OF THE INTENDED SUBJECTS OR OBJECTS. DOING SO, HE DELEGATES HIS POWER; AT THE SAME TIME, HE INDICATES MULTIPLICITY AND LATITUDE. THE QUEBEC CIVIL CODE RULES PERSONS, PROPERTY AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN PERSONS. "THIRD PARTIES" SHARE, ALONG WITH GOOD FAITH, FAULT, USAGE, EQUITY AND MANY OTHERS, THE DOMAIN OF VAGUE CONCEPTS. BY DEFINITION, THIRD PARTIES ARE OUTSIDERS. OUTSIDERS TO THE CITY, THEY ARE NOT GRANTED WITH A CITIZEN STATUS. OUTSIDERS TO THE COMMUNITY, THEY DO NOT SHARE ITS IDENTITY. THE FOREIGN ORIGIN IS PROMPTED BY A CLOSED SPACE, HERE A LEGAL SPACE CREATED BY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. IN THEORY, THIS STRUCTURE, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RELATIVE EFFECT AND OPPOSABILITY OF RIGHTS, IS REMARKABLY SIMPLE : THIRD PARTIES WHO TRY TO INTERFERE ARE THROWN OUT; THIRD PARTIES WE TRY TO INCLUDE ARE DISCHARGED. IS THE SOCIAL LIFE MORE COMPLEX? THE LEGAL CONSTRUCTION WILL ANSWER BY FRAGMENTING IT BACK TO THE PRIMARY MODEL. IN REALITY, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS CATCHES UP ON LAW; AT THE TIME OF ITS APPLICATION, THE COURTS CANNOT DUCK OUT. THIRD PARTIES ARE THEN PULLED OUT OF THIS JUMBLE IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO TAKE ON A LEGAL QUALITY. THEIR ONLY IDENTIFICATION WEAVES A WEB OF INTERTWINED RELATIONSHIPS.
851	THIS STUDY AROSE OUT OF THE GROWING INTEREST IN CITIZENSHIP ISSUES THAT HAVE REMAINED AN INTRACTABLE PROBLEM IN THE GLOBAL MIGRATION COMMUNITY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE REALITIES OF GLOBAL MIGRATION WHICH HAS NECESSITATED THE EXPANSION OF CITIZENSHIP POLICIES OF ADMISSION, ACQUISITION OF RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND INTERESTS OF MIGRANTS OR RESIDENTS CONTAINED IN STATUTORY PROVISIONS OR FRAMEWORKS OF MIGRANT'S COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE. THIS IS AGAINST THE BACKDROP DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE TO CREATE STABILITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION SYSTEM. IT BECOMES IMPERATIVE TO EXAMINE THE BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS ACCORDED TO MIGRANTS IN THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE WHICH HAS RAISED ISSUES NOT ONLY TOUCHING MIGRANTS' ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACILITIES BUT ALSO THE BURDEN OF MIGRATION ON CITIZENSHIP ISSUES OF MIGRANT'S PLACE OF RESIDENCE. IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO REITERATE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A NEED TO CREATE A PATH WHERE MIGRANTS MAY MOVE FROM A TEMPORARY FOREIGN RESIDENCY TO A PERMANENT ONE. IT IS THEREFORE ADVANCED THAT MEASURES ADOPTED TO ADDRESS THE BAR AGAINST CITIZENSHIP FOR MIGRANTS AROUND THE GLOBE SHOULD TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THEIR PECULIARITIES. THE STUDY ADOPTED AN ANALYTICAL -QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND BUILDS ITS ARGUMENT ON EXISTING LITERATURE WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY SYNTHESIZING IDEAS. IT ARGUED THAT STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE LIBERAL APPROACH TO DEMOCRATIC IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW MUST GUARANTEE AND ENSURE THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE PROVIDED IN THEIR MUNICIPAL LAWS AS WELL AS IN GLOBAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER AND EXAMINED HOW DIFFERENT MIGRATION POLICIES HAVE BEEN USED TO PROMOTE CITIZENSHIP AND THE SUCCESSFUL INCORPORATION OF MIGRANTS WITHIN THEIR HOST COUNTRIES.
852	THIS PAPER CONTAINS A SUMMARY, CHRONOLOGY AND ANALYSIS OF A SPECIFIC PROCESS THAT ALBANIA HAS IN GENERAL, AS IT IS THE SPECIFICITY OF BLOOD FEUD, WHICH IS ONE OF THE TYPICAL AND VERY CURRENT PROBLEMS OF THE ALBANIAN PEOPLE. THE IMPLICATION OF THE SECOND PARTIES AND THE THIRD PARTIES ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN RECONCILIATION OF THE LYNX AND THE EFFECT OF THE CANON OF LEKE DUKAGJINI AND OTHER SOCIO CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS FOR OVERCOMING THE INTER HUMAN CONFLICTS THAT FIND SUPPORT AT CUSTOMARY LAW, AT THE SAME TIME IT IS CONSIDERED AS AN ACT TO SETTLE DOWN THE DISPUTES, A LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL COMPONENT FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE COURTS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE CANON THAT ALBANIAN LAW IS AN ALBANIAN INSTITUTION, INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY, BUT ALSO A "FORMULATED IDEA". IT IS THE MIND AND SPIRIT OF THE ALBANIANS, CONCEIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE ORAL TRADITION, PRESERVED, PROTECTED WITH FANATICISM AND TRANSMITTED AS A MESSAGE, TO BE UNDERSTOOD, DISAGGREGATED AND ABSORBED IN THE WAY IT WAS FORMULATED AND TRANSMITTED, WITHOUT BEING CHANGED IN FORM AND CONTENT. THE CANONS ARE THE PRODUCT OF AN ANCESTRAL SOCIETY, WHEN CANON LAW WAS THE ONLY RIGHT TO REGULATE LIFE. LIFE BECOMES FIERCE NOT ONLY IN THE SENSE OF CONFRONTING NATURE, BUT ALSO OF PEOPLE WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY A CONSTANT COMPETITION, WHICH ONE ALONE CAN NOT WITHSTAND. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ALBANIAN SOCIETY AND STATE FACES IN THIS DECADE IS THE PHENOMENON OF BLOOD FEUD AND REVENGE, A HABIT INHERITED FROM THE ANCIENT PAST, INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
853	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DIVERGENCE ON THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF "CI-SHAN" (CHARITY) AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE CHARITY LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (CLPRC), IN THE CONTEXT OF LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, IN PARTICULAR THE STAGE LED BY THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS SINCE 2013. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE DISCOURSE OF CLPRC, WHICH WILL HAVE IMPACT ON THE FUTURE CHARITY LEGISLATION AS THE NATIONAL STRATEGY "RULE OF LAW" IN FULL SWING. THIS ARTICLE INDICATES THE TWO CONFUSIONS IN THE BASIC ORIENTATION OF CLPRC. FIRST, CLPRC WITH THE TENDENCY TOWARD ORGANIC LAW IGNORES THE BEHAVIOR LAW'S LOGIC OF THE CHARITY INSTITUTION; SECOND, THERE IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC LEGAL RELATIONSHIP IN A REVERSE PRIORITY, CHARITABLE LEGAL SYSTEM CARRIES STRONG INERTIA OF PUBLIC LAW AND NEEDS A REVISING PROCESS OF "PRIVATIZING PUBLIC LAW." CONSEQUENTLY, SOME ISSUES SHOULD BE CALLED FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE FOLLOWING THREE ASPECTS: THE FIRST ASPECT IS THAT THE RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK IS NOT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT/PROMOTE THIS CHARITABLE IDEAL OF PHILANTHROPY (DA CI-SHAN); THE SECOND ASPECT IS THAT THIS CHARITY LAW DOES NOT TOUCH UPON THE TAX SYSTEM, AND IT IS UNCERTAIN THAT THE NEW AUTHORITY WILL BE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PREFERENCE OF THIS CHARITY LEGISLATURE IN THE FUTURE TAX LEGISLATION; THE THIRD ASPECT IS THAT THE BASIC ORIENTATION OF THE CHARITY LAW WILL CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, AND THE ORGANIC AND PUBLIC LAW COMPLEX IS STILL VERY STRONG IN THE FIELD OF CHARITY AND PHILANTHROPY IN THE FUTURE SEVERAL YEARS.
854	DEALING WITH FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, "PARTICIPATION" EMERGED AS A CENTRAL THEME. THERE HAS, FOR SOME TIME, BEEN A GROWING RECOGNITION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY AT LARGE THAT THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT IN TURKEY DEPENDS ON MORE EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. ALONG WITH GROWING APPRECIATION OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS, THESE HAS BECOME MORE SYSTEMATIC IN UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS THAT CURRENTLY INHIBIT WIDER AND MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF PARTICIPATORY TECHNIQUES IN TURKEY. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THERE HAS BEEN A SUCCESSION OF STUDIES POINTING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CURRENT FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, ENTRENCHED INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ATTITUDES, AND POORLY ADAPTED LAWS ARE MAJOR CONSTRAINTS ON PARTICIPATORY FOREST MANAGEMENT. WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, THERE IS A GROWING CONSENSUS THAT TURKISH LEGISLATION FALLS SHORT OF THESE IN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THIS ACTS AS A CONSTRAINT ON PARTICIPATION BECAUSE OF ITS COMMAND AND CONTROL APPROACH, IN WHICH MOST DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THE STATE. THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW IS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AND PENALISE NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE DECISIONS AND THE LAW DOES NOT FULLY REFLECT CURRENT SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL REALITIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO FOCUS ON THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF TURKEY'S FOREST LAW PER SE, BY HIGHLIGHTING SOME INTERNATIONAL LESSONS AND PRACTICES THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO TURKEY AS IT CONSIDERS WHAT FUTURE STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN IN IMPROVING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PARTICIPATION IN FOREST MANAGEMENT. AS A RESULT, THIS STUDY CONCLUDED THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REQUIRES A WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL SYSTEM, PUBLIC SENSITIVITY AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE FOR A BETTER PARTICIPATORY FOREST MANAGEMENT.
855	THE ESSAY BEGINS WITH AN EXPLORATION OF HOW HENRY NEVILLE'S FICTIONAL ISLE OF PINES (1668) PLAYS THROUGH IDEAS OF ARCADIA, UTOPIA, BRITISH COLONIAL AMBITION, AND IDEAS OF BELONGING TOWARDS A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER A CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT THEN MORE FULLY TRACES HOW, NEARLY THREE AND A HALF CENTURIES LATER, THE REAL ISLANDS CLOSEST TO NEVILLE'S FICTIONAL ISLE THE CHAGOS ARCHIPELAGO - ARE STILL BEING TRAVERSED BY A SIMILAR INTERACTION OF NARRATIVES, AND REMAIN THE SITE OF A HIGHLY FRAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE ON THE LEGALITY OF BRITISH EXECUTIVE ACTION. THE CHAGOSSIAN ISLANDERS WERE EXPELLED BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN THE 1960S IN ORDER TO SATISFY A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, WHICH REQUIRED THE 'UNINHABITED' ISLANDS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MILITARY BASE. IN THEIR BATTLE TO HAVE THEIR EXPULSION DECLARED ILLEGAL, EXILED CHAGOSSIANS CHALLENGED THE SCOPE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PREROGATIVE POWERS WHEN DEALING WITH COLONIAL LANDS AND SUBJECTS. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT THE LINE OF UK JUDGMENTS ON THE CHAGOS (2000, 2006, 2007 AND DISSENTING JUDGMENTS OF 2008) CRUCIALLY RELIES ON A HALF-SUBDUED BUT AT TIMES LYRICAL, LEGALLY OPEN AND PROVOCATIVE EVOCATION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A 'BELONGER' OF A PLACE. THROUGH A CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORIES OF THIS WORD; THROUGH SCRUTINY OF ITS INDETERMINATE RELATIONSHIP TO NOTIONS OF CITIZENSHIP, INDIGENEITY, NATIONALITY AND THE LANGUAGE OF 'RIGHTS'; AND THROUGH AN ENGAGEMENT WITH BROADER CULTURAL NARRATIVES OF BELONGING, THE ESSAY MOVES TOWARDS A VALUING OF THE POTENTIAL OF PUBLIC LAW TO LEND BOTH ETHICALLY NUANCED AND PRACTICAL MEANING TO TERMS OF BELONGING.
856	AFTER A LONG TRADITION OF DISTANCE FROM STATE LEGALITY, OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES VARIOUS MARGINALISED GROUPS IN LATIN AMERICA HAVE BEEN TURNING TO LAW AND THE COURTS IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL PROVIDE THE SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT THE REGULAR POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS SYSTEMATICALLY DENIED THEM. ENCOURAGED BY THE COMPELLING RHETORIC OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED CONSTITUTIONALISM NOW PREVALENT IN TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ACADEMIA - AND HELPED LOGISTICALLY BY A DENSE NETWORK OF INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS - THESE SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY HAVE BEEN BETTING ON THE SORT OF JUDICIALLY TRIGGERED SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION EXEMPLIFIED BY THE US WARREN COURT AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS REMARKABLE TURN TO STATE LAW BY LATIN AMERICANS OWES MUCH TO THE RECONCILIATION OF LAW AND JUSTICE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND A NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT PRESCRIBES AN ACTIVIST ROLE OF THE COURTS IN THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. CONFRONTED WITH THIS NEW SCENARIO, QUESTIONS ARISE CONCERNING THE REAL POTENTIAL OF THIS NEW SHIFT TO LAW BY MARGINALISED GROUPS IN COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THROUGH THE STUDY OF THE TREATMENT BY THE CHILEAN COURTS OF INCARCERATED PEOPLES RIGHTS SINCE THE RETURN TO DEMOCRACY. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT, EVEN IN A COUNTRY WITH A HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, THE TURN TO THE JUDICIARY CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING. IN FACT, THE PASSIVITY OF THE CHILEAN COURTS BEFORE FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE INMATES IN THE COUNTRY'S GAOLS SEEM TO CONFIRM THE NOTION THAT THE TURN TO COURTS CAN ONLY BE A FIRST STEP - ONE THAT OUGHT TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MOBILISATION.
857	BY ANY PERSONAL COGNITIVE HANDICAP IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE FOUNDATION OF AN ORDERLY LEGAL COMMUNITY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. "MAKING RULES OF LAW DISCRETIONARY OR SUBJECT TO VALUE JUDGMENTS MAY BE DESTRUCTIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW" (BREDENKAMP V STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA LTD 2010 4 SA 468 (SCA) 481E). THE DISCRETIONARY POWER OF A DIVORCE COURT UNDER SECTION 7(3) OF THE DIVORCE ACT 70 OF 1979 STEMS FROM BEFORE THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL DISPENSATION. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM, IT WAS HOPED THAT AS TIME WENT BY, THE TRANSITIONAL EXCEPTION DATING TO 1984 THAT EXHIBITS CLEAR ELEMENTS OF ARBITRARINESS WOULD BE RELIED ON WITH DECLINING FREQUENCY. THERE IS ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF MARRIAGES STILL IN EXISTENCE CONCLUDED BEFORE NOVEMBER 1984 WITH AN ANTE-NUPTIAL CONTRACT PROVIDING FOR THE PROVERBIAL "COLD EXCLUSION OF ALL BENEFITS" THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AT THIS LATE STAGE IN THE SPOUSES' LIVES BE EXPECTED TO END IN THE DIVORCE COURT JUSTIFYING A RELIANCE ON THIS SECTION. THE ACT LIMITS THE DISCRETIONARY POWER TO EXPLICIT CONDITIONS: IT CAN BE CONSIDERED ONLY WHERE THE DIVORCE CONCERNED A MARRIAGE CONCLUDED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF ACT 88 OF 1984 WITH AN ANTENUPTIAL CONTRACT THAT EXCLUDED ACCRUAL SHARING AND ANY FORM OF ASSET SHARING AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME BETWEEN THE ERSTWHILE SPOUSES REGARDING THE DIVISION OF THEIR ASSETS. PROVIDED THESE CONDITIONS ARE MET, THE COURT CAN ORDER THAT SUCH ASSETS, OR SUCH PART OF THE ASSETS OF THE OTHER PARTY AS THE COURT MAY DEEM JUST, BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRST-MENTIONED PARTY (S 7(3)). IN ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES A VALID ANTE-NUPTIAL CONTRACT EXISTS TO WHICH BOTH PARTIES AGREED IN THE PRESENCE OF A NOTARY PUBLIC AND THE APPLICANT IN REALITY NEVER ACQUIRED ANY CLAIM TO THE OTHER PARTY'S ASSETS. THE APPLICANT IN ADDITION REPRESENTED TO THE OTHER SPOUSE, THE NOTARY PUBLIC AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE A CLAIM WOULD NEVER BE MADE TO ANY OF THE RESPONDENT'S ASSETS. "REASONABLENESS AND FAIRNESS ARE NOT FREESTANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EXERCISE OF A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT.... ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOTION THAT JUDGES CAN REFUSE TO ENFORCE A CONTRACTUAL PROVISION MERELY BECAUSE IT OFFENDS THEIR PERSONAL SENSE OF FAIRNESS AND EQUITY WILL GIVE RISE TO LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL UNCERTAINTY" (POTGIETER V POTGIETER NO 2012 1 SA 637 (SCA) 650F-H). IN GREYLING V MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS ((40023/21) 2022 ZAGPPHC 311 (11 MAY 2022)) THE COURT REGARDED THE UPHOLDING OF THE CLAIM OF THE APPLICANT CONTRARY TO THE EXPLICIT MISREPRESENTATION BY THE APPLICANT THAT SHE IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THE NOTARIALLY REGISTERED ANTE-NUPTIAL CONTRACT OF 1989 GOVERNING THE MARRIAGE, POTENTIALLY FAIR. THE COURT ORDERED THE FIRST CONDITION IN SECTION 7(3) OF ACT 70 OF 1979, LIMITING ITS APPLICATION TO PRE-NOVEMBER 1984 MARRIAGES, UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIS JUDGMENT MAY BE POPULAR AND IN LINE WITH WHAT THE WOMAN IN THE STREET MIGHT REGARD AS FAIR, PRESUMABLY ABANDONING THE PRINCIPLE OF PACTA SUNT SERVANDA AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING ESTOPPEL, BUT DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE UPHOLDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. "THE COURT DOES NOT AS YET SIT, AS UNDER A PALM TREE, TO EXERCISE A GENERAL DISCRETION TO DO WHAT THE MAN IN THE STREET, ON A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE CASE, MIGHT REGARD AS FAIR" (SPRINGETTE V DEFOE 1992 2 FLR 388 391). IT IS ARGUED THAT LEGAL CERTAINTY WILL NOT BE ENHANCED SHOULD THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CONFIRM THIS JUDGMENT. AN ALLEGED RELIANCE ON PRINCIPLES OR POLICY EXCLUSIVELY BASED ON COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RECOGNITION OF SUCH A DISCRETIONARY POWER UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE POSITION UNDER CIVIL LAW SYSTEMS WHICH INDEED SHARE COMMON ROOTS WITH SPECIFICALLY THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRIVATE LAW SYSTEM IS ONCE MORE AN EXAMPLE OF THE DEMISE OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE WHERE LEGAL PROFESSIONALS SEEM TO BE UNABLE TO DO PROPER, RELEVANT AND RELIABLE COMPARATIVE LEGAL RESEARCH. SINCE THE HUSBAND IN THE GREYLING CASE DID NOT EVEN OPPOSE THE CLAIM OF HIS SPOUSE (ALL PRIOR TO A DIVORCE APPLICATION) AND CHOSE TO ABIDE BY THE COURT'S DECISION, IT IS INDEED STRANGE THAT THE COURT REFRAINED FROM REFERRING TO AND RECOGNISING THAT THE PARTIES COULD AT ANY STAGE SINCE 1989, HAVE RELIED ON SECTION 21(1) OF ACT 88 OF 1984 TO HAVE EFFECTED A CHANGE IN THEIR MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY REGIME. IT REEKS OF MISUSE OF THE COURT PROCESS FOR THE COURT, UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, TO HOLD AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THAT PART OF SECTION 7(3) AS BEING THE ONLY POSSIBLE REMEDY FOR THE CLAIMANT AGAINST THE PERCEIVED INJUSTICE SHE WOULD BE SUFFERING ON DIVORCING HER HUSBAND BECAUSE OF THEIR MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY REGIME, IS MIND-BLOWING. THE ONLY BENEFIT OF NOT RELYING ON SECTION 21(1) WOULD BE TO NOT BE BOUND BY THE REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN SECTION 21(1)(A-C) - THERE ARE SOUND REASONS FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGE; SUFFICIENT NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO ALL THE CREDITORS OF THE SPOUSES; AND NO OTHER PERSON WILL BE PREJUDICED BY THE PROPOSED CHANGE - AND THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE MISUSE. SECTION 36(1)(E) OF THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT THE RIGHTS IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS MAY BE LIMITED BUT ONLY IN TERMS OF A LAW OF GENERAL APPLICATION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LIMITATION IS REASONABLE AND JUSTIFIABLE IN AN OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BASED ON HUMAN DIGNITY, EQUALITY AND FREEDOM ( PARTY AUTONOMY), TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL RELEVANT FACTORS, INCLUDING LESS RESTRICTIVE MEANS TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE. IT IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE IN INSTANCES LIKE THESE.
858	THIS ARTICLE IS A REVIEW OF THE MONOGRAPH << THE LEGAL IDEOLOGY OF A MODERN POLITICALLY ORGANIZED SOCIETY >> BY ALEKSEY IVANOVICH KLYMENKO, DOCTOR OF LAW, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, PROFESSOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THEORY OF STATE AND LAW, MOSCOW UNIVERSITY OF THE MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR OF RUSSIA, NAMED AFTER V.Y. KIKOT'. THE REVIEW ANALYZES THE PROBLEM OF THE FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF LAW IDEOLOGY, ITS ESSENCE AND NATURE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM OF FORMING THE LAW IDEOLOGY OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MONOGRAPH ITSELF IS OF A THEORETICAL AND LEGAL NATURE, IN THE REVIEW THE THEORETICAL POSITIONS OF A.I. KLIMENKO IN TERMS OF THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE IDEOLOGY OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW ARE ANALYZED. THE AUTHORS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MONOGRAPH BY A.I. KLIMENKO, BEING GENERAL THEORETICAL, CREATES STRONG METHODOLOGICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL GROUNDS FOR CARRYING OUT MORE CONCRETE STUDIES OF PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE FORMATION OF THE IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF LAW, INCLUDING THE PROBLEM OF THE IDEOLOGY OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS.
859	"MUTUAL TRUST" HAS BECOME ONE OF THE CENTRAL BUZZWORDS OF THE EU IN ITS SEARCH OF THE FUTURE OF EUROPEAN UNION PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE FOLLOWING TEXT UNFOLDS POSSIBLE MEANINGS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE OMNIPRESENT BUT QUITE OPAQUE NOTION OF MUTUAL TRUST IN EUROPEAN POLICY-MAKING. THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF MUTUAL TRUST IN PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW IN GENERAL WILL BRIEFLY BE CONSIDERED. THEN THE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL BE ANALYSED, FIRST ON THE LEVEL OF PRIMARY LAW (WHAT TO TRUST IN). SECONDLY THE FUNCTIONING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND THEIR STRUCTURAL REPERCUSSIONS ON EUROPEAN CHOICE OF LAW THINKING WILL BE CONSIDERED INSOFAR AS IT REVOLVES AROUND A MUTUAL "RECOGNITION" OF LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS. ON THE LEVEL OF SECONDARY LAW THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL CO-OPERATION IN CIVIL MATTERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF MUTUAL TRUST, THE OPERATION OF THAT NORMATIVE SYSTEM BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN RECENT AND TELLING CASES, CHALLENGES FOR THIS NORMATIVE SYSTEM FROM THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS CHALLENGES FROM THE COMMISSION'S 2014 PROPOSAL FOR REACTING TO SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN A MEMBER STATE. FINALLY, SUGGESTIONS WILL BE SUBMITTED AS TO HOW THESE CHALLENGES COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM. THE LAST PART WILL SUM UP INSIGHTS FROM THE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE MULTIFACETED TERM OF "MUTUAL TRUST".
860	SINCE THE ENTERPRISE BANKRUPTCY LAW OF CHINA [HEREAFTER THE 2006 EBL] TOOK EFFECT COMPOSITIONS THEREUNDER HAVE FACED BOTH ACADEMIC AND PRACTICAL CRISES. THERE MAY BE THREE REASONS FOR THESE CRISES: (I) RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND, (II) MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE OF COMPOSITION, AND (III) ITS NONCONFORMITY WITH OVERSEAS' LEGISLATION GOVERNING RESTRUCTURING. THE SUCCESSFUL MARKET -ORIENTATED REFORM UNDERLYING THE 2006 EBL HAS MADE PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS BANKRUPTCY LAW; THEY NO LONGER OPPOSE IT. THE INHERENT CONTRACTUAL NATURE OF COMPOSITION IMPLIES THAT ITS MISSION SHOULD BE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES WITH REGARD TO CLAIMS AND DEBTS ARISING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, HOWEVER, IN JURISDICTIONS, SUCH AS JAPAN AND GERMANY, SHOW THAT COMPOSITION HAS ALREADY BEEN ABANDONED. COMPOSITION IS NOT DEVISED TO SAVE THE DISTRESSED ENTERPRISES AS A NEWLY EMERGED REORGANIZATION AS COMPOSITION IS TIME-CONSUMING, COSTLY AND INEFFICIENT WHEN COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES, SUCH AS ADR. ADR CAN DRAMATICALLY ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY THAT DEBTS ARE PAID OFF, THUS PROVIDING MORE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO CREDITORS.
861	THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY (PRAWO I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC, OR PIS), WHICH HAS BEEN RULING IN POLAND SINCE 2015, HAS DEVELOPED A SPECIFIC NARRATIVE ABOUT THE LAW AND JUDICIARY, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE IDEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF ITS STANCE IN THE CONFLICT CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY. THE MAIN TENETS OF THE LEGAL IDEOLOGY OF LAW AND JUSTICE INCLUDE THE VIEWS THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS ARE NOT DETERMINED BY LEGAL TEXTS (THE INDETERMINACY THESIS), AND THAT JUDGES ARE PART OF AN ELITE WHO ARE DETACHED FROM SOCIETY AT LARGE AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO IMPOSE THE LIBERAL WORLD-VIEW UPON A CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY. THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO DECONSTRUCT THOSE IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTS IN A SEARCH FOR THEIR POSSIBLE SOURCES IN CERTAIN CRITICAL CURRENTS IN THE LEGAL THEORY OF THE POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC, REPRESENTED BY STANISLAW EHRLICH, LESZEK NOWAK AND JAROSLAW LADOSZ. THE PAPER NOTES INTERESTING PARALLELS BETWEEN THE LEGAL IDEAS DEVELOPED BY THOSE THREE LEGAL THEORISTS AND THE CURRENT NARRATIVE PUT FORWARD BY LAW AND JUSTICE. WHILST STOPPING SHORT OF CLAIMING A DIRECT AND CONSCIOUS INSPIRATION, THE PAPER NONETHELESS HYPOTHESISES POSSIBLE AVENUES OF INFLUENCE, INCLUDING THE ACADEMIC MENTORSHIP OF EHRLICH OVER JAROSLAW KACZYFISKI IN THE EARLY 197OS AND NOWAK'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE 'SOLIDARITY' MOVEMENT IN THE 198OS FOLLOWING HIS ANTI-MARXIST INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL TURN. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT LEGAL CRITIQUE IN POLAND, AFTER A PERIOD OF BEING REPRESSED IN THE 19905, IS NOW RETURNING; HOWEVER, WHILST ITS FIRST APPEARANCE (IN THE SOCIALIST PERIOD) WAS A 'TRAGEDY' (DUE TO ITS INABILITY TO SUBJECT SOCIALIST LAW TO ANY FORM OF CRITIQUE), ITS CURRENT RETURN IS A 'FARCE', SINCE CRITICAL TOOLS ARE USED NOT FOR THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE (EMANCIPATION), BUT IN ORDER TO FURTHER A POPULIST-CONSERVATIVE PROJECT.
862	IN THE MONOGRAPH OF N. KOLLMANN, "CRIME AND PUNISHMENT IN RUSSIA OF EARLY MODERN TIME" (2016) IS A SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE JUDICIAL PRACTICE IN CASES OF "THIEVES AND WICKED PEOPLE" OF THE 17TH AND BEGINNING OF THE 18TH CENTURIES. SOCIOLOGY OF LAW IS THE DOMINANT TYPE OF LAW IN ANGLO-SAXON LEGAL FAMILY BUT TO THE ROMANO-GERMANIC LEGAL FAMILY, WHICH INCLUDES RUSSIA, THE DOMINANT IS THE NORMATIVITY TYPE OF LAW. THIS CULTURAL BARRIER HAS NOT BEEN OVERCOME BY N. KOLLMANN, WHICH RESULTED IN ANNOYING ERRORS, DESPITE THE UNDOUBTED MERITS OF HER RESEARCH. AMONG THE WEAKER POINTS IS, AT FIRST, TO HIGHLIGHT THE LACK OF DEFINITION OF THOSE OFFENCES WHICH IT CONSIDERS TO BE CRIMINAL OFFENCES. THE MODERN LEGAL CONSTRUCTION OF CRIMINAL LAW ONLY APPEARS IN THE ENLIGHTENMENT. SECOND, N. KOLLMANN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE ACTS OF LAWMAKING BY PRINCES AND THE KING DO NOT MATCH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A MODERN REGULATORY ACT, THE MODERN CONCEPT OF LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW APPEAR IN RUSSIA IN THE EPOCH OF PETER THE GREAT. THIRD, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADVERSARIAL AND INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS FORMS ARE NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO THE SCIENCE OF PROCEDURAL LAW. HOWEVER, A STUDY IN N. KOLLMANN, HAS UNDOUBTED ADVANTAGES. SHE DESCRIBED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND SOCIETY IN COUNTERACTING "THIEVES AND DESPERATE PEOPLE". ITS MERIT IS THE CRITICISM OF E. ANISIMOV'S ABSURD HYPOTHESIS OF THE ARBITRARINESS OF SUPPOSEDLY TYPICAL FOR RUSSIA. ON THE CONTRARY, N. KOLLMANN, COMES TO REASONABLE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW LAW AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN RUSSIA CORRESPONDED TO THE LEVEL OF EUROPE, POSSESSED THE PROPERTY OF LEGAL CERTAINTY: "THE JUDGE FOLLOWED THE PRESCRIBED JUDICIAL PROCEDURES, AND PUNISHMENTS; THE PRACTICE OF CRIMINAL LAW HAS BEEN A CONSTANT AND CONSISTENT". REFS 22.
863	STATES ARE THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE HIMALAYAN STATE OF NEPAL FULFILS ALL THE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS OF STATEHOOD. IT IS AN INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGN STATE. IT IS A MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATIONS. ON 1 JUNE 2001, KING BIRENDRA, QUEEN ASHWARYA AND OTHER CLOSE RELATIVES WERE KILLED IN A SHOOTING SPREE BY DRUNKEN CROWN PRINCE DIPENDRA, WHO THEN SHOT HIMSELF TO DEATH. LATER ON, GYANENDRA WAS CROWNED AS THE KING OF NEPAL ON 4 JUNE 2001. HE WAS A MAN OF HIGH AMBITION. HE MISUSED THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF 1990. HE TRIED TO JUSTIFY HIS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ARBITRARY ACTS UNDER ARTICLE 127 AND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE GENERAL ELECTIONS FOR THE NEW CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY AND INTERIM PARLIAMENT WERE HELD ON 10 APRIL 2008. ON 28 MAY 2008, THE NEW CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DECLARED NEPAL A 'SECULAR, FEDERAL, DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLIC' NATION. ON 1 JULY 2008, THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ELECTED NEPALI CONGRESS LEADER DR. RAM BARAN YADAV AS PRESIDENT OF NEPAL. AT PRESENT, NEPAL HAS ITS ELECTED PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER. THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO FRAME A NEW CONSTITUTION FOR THE COUNTRY. IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE NEW CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY SHALL TRY TO ADOPT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE WORD "CONSTITUTION" IS USED IN TWO DIFFERENT SENSES, THE ABSTRACT AND THE CONCRETE. THE CONSTITUTION OF A STATE IN THE ABSTRACT SENSE IS THE SYSTEM OF LAWS, CUSTOMS AND CONVENTIONS WHICH DEFINE THE COMPOSITION AND POWERS OF ORGANS OF THE STATE, AND REGULATE THE RELATIONS OF THE VARIOUS STATE ORGANS TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE PRIVATE CITIZEN. A "CONSTITUTION" IN THE CONCRETE SENSE IS THE DOCUMENT IN WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT LAWS OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE AUTHORITATIVELY ORDAINED.
864	CORRUPTION IS A DEVASTATING PHENOMENON THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS, QUESTIONS THE RULE OF LAW, JEOPARDIZES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROSPERITY, AND DEEPENS INEQUALITY AND POVERTY. CORRUPTION IS SO WIDESPREAD THAT EVEN THE SECTOR THAT SHOULD BE THE BEARER OF ACTIVITIES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION -THE POLICE, HAVE NOT REMAINED IMMUNE, WHICH IS ALSO THE CASE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CORRUPTION, THE AIMS OF THE RESEARCH ARE MULTIFACETED: TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND THE PERCEPTION OF ACTIVE POLICE OFFICERS EMPLOYED IN SIPA, REPUBLIKA SRPSKA MOI, AND THE SARAJEVO CANTON MOI OF CORRUPTION COMMITTED BY FELLOW POLICE OFFICERS, AND WHAT TYPE OF CORRUPTION IS INVOLVED IN MOST CASES; TO DISCOVER THE FACTORS THAT PREVENT BIH POLICE OFFI CERS FROM REPORTING ACTS OF CORRUPTION TO COMPETENT INSTITUTIONS AND TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF REPORTED AND PROSECUTED CRIMINAL ACTS OF CORRUPTION COMMITTED BY POLICE OFFICERS IN THE MENTIONED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE METHOD USED TO ACHIEVE THE STATED GOALS IS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE. QUALITATIVE METHOD INCLUDES DESK, ARCHIVAL, AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT SCHOLARLY AND EXPERT SOURCES AS WELL AS THE ANALYSIS OF THE REPORTS BY THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFI CES OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, REPUBLIKA SRPSKA AND SARAJEVO CANTON WITH REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF REPORTED AND PROSECUTED CASES OF CORRUPTION COMMITTED BY POLICE OFFICERS. PRIMARY DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE, COMPOSED OF RELEVANT QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF CORRUPTION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE 300 RESPONDENTS INCLUDE POLICE OFFI CERS IN ALL RANKS EMPLOYED IN THE MENTIONED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH HAS PROVEN THE PRESENCE OF CORRUPTION, ITS POOR REPORTING AND PROSECUTION, ESTABLISHED ITS CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES AND PROPOSED THE METHODS OF ERADICATION.
865	THE CATEGORIES OF INTERPRETATION, CONCRETIZATION AND LEGAL ANALOGIES IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE COURT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL BODY, AS WELL AS THE VIEWS OF SCIENTISTS ABOUT THEIR FUNCTIONAL PURPOSE, ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE FUNCTIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERPRETATION, CONCRETIZATION AND ANALOGY OF LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL THEORY, WHICH ENVISIONS THE NEED TO STUDY STATE-LEGAL PHENOMENA BY FOCUSING ON LEGAL PRACTICE AND THAT SCIENCE IS NECESSARY TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF PRACTICE AND THAT PRACTICE IS A TRUTH-CRITERION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON JUDICIAL ERRORS ARISING FROM A MISUNDERSTANDING OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND CONCRETIZATION OF LEGAL NORMS THAT MAY BORDER RULEMAKING. THE INADMISSIBILITY IS SUBSTANTIATED OF TURNING THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW INTO SIMPLE COMMENTARY RESULTS IN FAILING TO ACHIEVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL REGULATION. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, CONCRETIZATION IS THE RESULT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE GOAL OF THE INTERPRETATION PROCESS SINCE IT IS A METHOD, A WAY OF INTERPRETING THE LAW, RESULTING FROM THE FACT THAT THE LAW CANNOT COVER ALL THE NUANCES OF PUBLIC RELATIONS WITH REGULATION. EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION OF INTERPRETATION AND ANALOGIES OF LAW IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COURT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL BODY ARE ANALYZED BASED ON THE PRACTICE OF COURTS' APPEALS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONCRETIZATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT ACT AS AN INDEPENDENT CATEGORY; IT IS THE GOAL OF THE INTERPRETATION PROCESS AND AT THE SAME TIME ITS RESULT. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE WRONG CHOICE OF THE OPTIMAL VARIANT FOR A CASE'S COURT DECISION, WITHOUT USING AN ANALOGY IN LAW WITH VARIOUS METHODS AND TECHNIQUES FOR INTERPRETING LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, CAN LEAD TO INCONSISTENCIES AND PROBLEMS IN LEGAL REGULATION.
866	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF DIRECT EFFECT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS THE DELINEATION OF CONCEPTS OF DIRECT ACTION AND THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE PROPOSED TOPIC IS VERY RELEVANT, BECAUSE NOWADAYS, WHEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS STRIVING TO BUILD A RULE-OF-LAW STATE AND A DEVELOPED CIVIL SOCIETY, THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL BASES OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF CONSTITUTION REQUIRE A SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY WAS: A FORMAL-LOGICAL METHOD THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CLARIFY THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, DISTINGUISHING IT FROM THE STATICS AND DYNAMICS FROM OTHER REGULATORY LEGAL ACTS. THE PRACTICE OF DIRECT ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS ANALYZED WITH FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD. THE AUTHORS ANALYZED THEORETICAL MATERIAL: THE WORKS OF A.B. VENGEROV, N.V. VITRUK, YU.I. GREVTSOV, A.N. KOKOTOV, I.A. KRAVETS, V.O. LUCHIN, V.V. NEVINSKII, B.S. EBZEEV, - AS WELL AS EMPIRICAL DATA - DECISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND OTHER COURTS. THE AUTHORS CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DIRECT EFFECT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS A LEGAL FEATURE OF THE NORMS OF THE BASIC LAW, THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EXISTENCE OF NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS THAT SPECIFY THEM. EVEN IF IT IS NECESSARY TO SPECIFY THE NORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION, CLARIFYING RULES ARE CREATED ON THE BASIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND ONLY DEVELOP THEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPLEMENTATION. DIRECT APPLICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES IS ONLY ONE OF THE FORMS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION, ACCORDING TO ART. 15 (PT. 1) OF RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION.
867	IN HIS PREFACE TO ALMAYER'S FOLLY, WRITTEN SOON AFTER THE NOVEL'S COMPLETION, CONRAD TAKES ISSUE WITH ALICE MEYNELL'S RECENT ARTICLE ON "DECIVILIZATION": "I AM CONTENT TO SYMPATHISE WITH COMMON MORTALS" HE WRITES, "NO MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE; IN HOUSES OR IN HUTS, IN STREETS UNDER A FOG OR IN THE FORESTS BEHIND THE DARK LINE OF DISMAL MANGROVES THAT FRINGE THE VAST SOLITUDE OF THE SEA" (3). AT FIRST READING, CONRAD SEEMS TO PEDDLE THE VERY SAME PREJUDICES HE CRITIQUES IN ALICE MEYNELL: JIM-ENG, THE CHINESE OPIUM WRECK; TAMINAH, THE IMPASSIVE ORIENTAL WOMAN INURED AGAINST PAIN; AND ALMAYER HIMSELF, THE INDO-EUROPEAN RUINED BY HIS FANTASIES OF FORTUNE AND UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE EUROPEAN WORLD HE REVERES. EACH ARE STOCK CHARACTERS AMONGST MANY MORE IN THE NOVEL PLAYING A PART LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE GIVEN TO THEM BY THE POPULAR AUTHORS WHOSE WORKS MEYNELL DISMISSES. WHAT DISTINGUISHES THEM IS THEIR NARRATIVE CONTEXT, WHOSE MACHINATIONS THROW INTO RELIEF THE INSTABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE "CIVILIZING" MISSION OF COLONIALISM. CONRAD'S TIME IN SOUTH EAST ASIA WAS ONE OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL TRANSFORMATION FOR BORNEO, THE REPERCUSSIONS OF WHICH CONRAD TRANSLATES DIRECTLY INTO ALMAYER'S FOLLY. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT HIS SYMPATHIES WITH THE COLONIZED ARE EXPRESSED LESS THROUGH INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS THAN THROUGH THE COMPLEXITIES, FRUSTRATIONS, AND INDETERMINACIES THAT ARISE OUT OF THE COLONIAL ENTERPRISE. A KEY CONCERN FOR CONRAD, THEREFORE, IS THE PROBLEM OF JUSTICE IN AN INTERNATIONAL SETTING. LONG BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF "GEOGRAPHY AND SOME EXPLORERS," CONRAD'S FICTION WAS ALREADY ILLUMINATING THE INCONSISTENCIES THAT EMERGE IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL LAW INTO PRACTICE IN THE INDETERMINATE SPACES OF COLONIAL GEOGRAPHY.
868	WITHOUT DOUBT, PERVASIVE CORRUPTION MAY UNDERMINE A GOVERNMENT'S LEGITIMACY. CITIZENS MAY LOSE FAITH IN POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND BECOME CYNICAL OR REBEL. ULTIMATELY, THE VERY SURVIVAL OF THE POLITY MAY BE AT STAKE. THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THESE ISSUES, BUT AT A RATHER SPECIFIC CONCEPTUAL LEVEL. IN PARTICULAR, IT EXPLORES THE NOTION OF A LEGITIMATION CRISIS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION IN LATIN AMERICA. THIS EXERCISE WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO APPRECIATE HOW CORRUPT PRACTICES DEBILITATE THE STATE'S CLAIM TO JUSTIFICATION. INDEED, THE NOTION OF A LEGITIMATION CRISIS HELPS TO ILLUMINATE THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENTAL DISHONESTY IN LATIN AMERICA. IF PROPERLY REINTERPRETED, IT ENABLES ONE TO GRASP CORRUPTION AS AN ENDEMIC THREAT TO THE NORMATIVE IDENTITY OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITIES. THE CONCEPT MAY DESCRIBE A SITUATION IN WHICH THESE COLLECTIVITIES MUST, AT THE OUTSET, TRANSITION FROM AN INSTRUMENTAL TO A REFLEXIVE CONSTRUCTION OF LEGITIMACY NORMS, SUCH AS AUTONOMY, LEGALITY, AND EQUALITY, IN ORDER EFFECTIVELY TO REGENERATE A CORRUPT BUREAUCRACY AND, THEREAFTER, STRUGGLE TO RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES AFTER THE CHANGEOVER. ACCORDINGLY, ONE SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGE EXCLUSIVELY IN A TECHNICAL MANNER, SUCH AS WITH THE ENACTMENT OF TOUGHER LAWS OR WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MORE DRASTIC ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. NOR SHOULD ONE TAKE A MERELY MOTIVATIONAL APPROACH, IN THE SENSE OF U.S. PSYCHOLOGIST DAVID MCCLELLAND, RATHER THAN THAT OF HABERMAS. IN OTHER WORDS, ONE SHOULD NOT SOLELY SEEK TO CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OR THE PREVAILING PROFESSIONAL CULTURE IN CIVIL SERVICE. INSTEAD, LATIN AMERICAN SOCIETIES MUST EMBARK UPON AN UNLIKELY RADICAL CRUSADE TO TRANSFORM THE WAY IN WHICH THEY UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES, PARTICULARLY THE PREMISES OF THEIR SOCIAL INTEGRATION. AGAINST ALL ODDS, THEY MUST GENUINELY COMMIT TO AND IDENTIFY WITH DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SOLIDARITY.
869	IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHOR INTRODUCES AND ELABORATES ON THE MOST RELEVANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM AND A VERSION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT IS ESSENTIALLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF GARANTISM. FIRSTLY, HE ARGUES THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN BE CONCEIVED IN TWO OPPOSITE WAYS: AS A WAY TO OVERCOME LEGAL POSITIVISM, THUS WITH A CERTAIN TENDENCY TOWARDS IUSNATURALISM, OR AS THE EXPANSION OR IMPROVEMENT OF THE FORMER; FOR THESE PURPOSES HE COMMITS HIMSELF TO A REVISION OF THE STANDARD TERMINOLOGY. SECONDLY, THE AUTHOR MAINTAINS THAT WERE THE CONSTITUTION TO EMBODY PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE OF AN ETHICAL-POLITICAL NATURE, THEN IT WILL DISAPPEAR THE MAIN DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF LEGAL POSITIVISM: THE SEPARATION BETWEEN LAW AND MORALITY OR THE SEPARATION BETWEEN VALIDITY AND JUSTICE. HE CONSIDERS THAT ESSENTIALLY GARANTIST CONSTITUTIONALISM IS A STRENGTHENED VERSION OF LEGAL POSITIVISM: IT COMPLETES A RULE OF LAW SYSTEM SINCE IT IMPLIES BOTH SUBMISSION TO THE LAW AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. FOURTH, THE AUTHOR MAINTAINS THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT ANY LEGAL SYSTEM OBJECTIVELY MEETS SOME "ETHICAL MINIMUM" IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE OLD IUSNATURALIST CLAIM. ETHICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, FOR WHICH CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ARE INTENDED TO BE OBJECTIVELY FAIR, IS THUS THE CURRENT VERSION OF ETHICAL LEGALISM. FIFTH, THE AUTHOR OBJECTS TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRINCIPLES AND RULES THAT UNDERLIES A CONCEPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OF CONSTITUTIONALISM OPPOSITE TO THE POSITIVIST AND GARANTIST ONE. SIXTH, THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES' BEING ALWAYS WEIGHTED AND NOT ONLY APPLIED THREATENS THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JURISDICTION AND ITS POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. AND, FINALLY, THE AUTHOR STRESSES THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM SOMEHOW IMPLIES BOTH THE UNDERMINING AND VIRTUAL COLLAPSE OF THE NORMATIVITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS THE DEVALUATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO MERELY GENERIC ETHICAL-POLITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS.
870	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPTS TO PRECLUDE JUDICIAL REVIEW THROUGH STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT PURPORT TO STRIP COURTS OF THEIR JURISDICTION. AT BOTTOM, THESE "OUSTER CLAUSES" RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. BY CONTRASTING THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY, WITH A FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL FEATURE OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY NOTING THAT IT MIGHT SEEM UNREMARKABLE THAT THE SOVEREIGN BRITISH PARLIAMENT WOULD, ON OCCASION, ATTEMPT LEGISLATIVELY TO OUST THE JURISDICTION OF ENGLISH COURTS. CORRESPONDINGLY, THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT IT MIGHT SEEM UNLIKELY THAT THE COEQUAL AMERICAN CONGRESS WOULD EVER ATTEMPT LEGISLATIVELY TO PRECLUDE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FEDERAL COURTS. AFTER ADDRESSING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATUTORY CASES (WHERE ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND MORE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO LEGISLATIVE OUSTER) AND CONSTITUTIONAL CASES (WHERE ONE MIGHT NOT), THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT, SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, BRITISH COURTS SEEM LOATH TO PERMIT OUSTER EVEN IN STATUTORY CASES WHILE AMERICAN COURTS LARGELY TOLERATE THIS PRACTICE. HOWEVER, IN CONSTITUTIONAL CASES, BOTH THE ENGLISH COURTS AND THE AMERICAN COURTS SEEM UNWILLING TO RELINQUISH THEIR JURISDICTION AND INSTITUTIONAL POSITION IN THE FACE OF LEGISLATIVE PRESSURE. TO EXPLAIN THIS UNIFIED RESPONSE, DESPITE APPARENT OR ALLEGED CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES, THE ARTICLE DEVELOPS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF ACCESS TO THE COURTS IN ENGLAND AND A SIMILAR, BUT LARGELY UN-STATED, RECOGNITION OF THIS RIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ARTICLE CHALLENGES COMMONLY OFFERED EXPLANATIONS BASED ON A WRITTEN/UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION, ASSERTIONS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY, AND DIFFERENCES IN THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR AND EXERCISE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. INSTEAD, THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE THE AUTHENTIC NATURE OF BOTH NATIONS' OVERARCHING COMMITMENTS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL AUTONOMY THROUGH THE WORK OF CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARS AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS.
871	IN TIMES OF CRISIS THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE TENDENCY TO AUGMENT AND EXTEND THE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS CENTRALIZING TENDENCY HAS BEEN EXHIBITED IN NUMEROUS LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THROUGH VARIED KINDS OF CRISIS. MORE RECENTLY, SIMILAR TRENDS HAVE BEEN MUCH IN EVIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND A CORRESPONDING ACADEMIC DISCOURSE DEFENDING AND EXTOLLING THE VIRTUES OF SUCH AUGMENTATION HAS EMERGED. THIS ARTICLE IS SKEPTICAL OF THE VIRTUES OF SUCH ADVICE AND ITS ULTIMATE POLICY BENEFITS. WE ASSERT THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL DANGERS TO THE CENTRALIZATION OF CRISIS POWERS IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. THESE TENDENCIES HOLD PARTICULAR PERILS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC STATE. MOREOVER, THE RUSH TO CREATE OR CEMENT DECISION AND REVIEW MAKING HIERARCHIES CAN BE ANTITHETICAL TO THE PROJECT OF UTILIZING THE STRENGTHS OF RULE OF LAW BASED SOCIETIES TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES POSED BY VIOLENT ACTORS. THE PURPORTED BENEFITS OF EXCLUDING, OR AT BEST SIDELINING, THE COURTS FROM REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS OF CRISIS REGULATION ARE PARTICULARLY ILLCONCEIVED. SUCH PROPOSALS CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO ENGAGE WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF ACROSS-THE-BOARD INSTITUTIONAL LEGAL ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE ACTION IN TIMES OF CRISIS. THE SUCCESS AND VALUE OF SUCH ENGAGEMENT CANNOT BE MEASURED FROM THE CRISIS VANTAGE POINT. RATHER IT REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT BEYOND THE MOMENT OF EXCEPTION, FACTORING IN A RETURN TO NORMALCY AND THE IMPACT ON LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE POST-CRISIS PHASE. WE ASSERT THAT SCHOLARS ADVOCATING FOR EXCLUSIVE EXECUTIVE SUPREMACY IN TIMES OF CRISIS FAIL TO MEASURE THE HARMS THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY INEPT OR ILLEGAL STATE ACTION, NOT ONLY AS EXPERIENCED BY INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS BUT TO THE BROADER PROJECT OF DISCOURAGING AND DISSUADING THE RESORT TO GROUP BASED VIOLENCE.
872	FEW JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF LAWMAKERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND ACADEMICS MORE THAN THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISIONS DEALING WITH STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. HOLDING THAT CONGRESS MAY NOT ABROGATE STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FROM FEDERAL STATUTORY CLAIMS WHEN ACTING PURSUANT TO ITS ARTICLE I REGULATORY POWERS, THOSE DECISIONS SERIOUSLY LIMIT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS AGAINST STATE DEFENDANTS, CREATING A GAP BETWEEN RIGHT AND REMEDY THAT ARGUABLY IMPAIRS THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE MUCH OF THE SCHOLARSHIP IN THIS AREA CONTINUES TO DWELL ON ABROGATION AS THE PRIMARY MEANS OF ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO VINDICATE RIGHTS AGAINST THE STATES, THE COURT CLEARLY FAVORS AN APPROACH IN WHICH STATES WAIVE THEIR IMMUNITY FROM SUIT. IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR CHRISTINA BOHANNAN EXAMINES THREE COMMON SITUATIONS IN WHICH A STATE MIGHT BE DEEMED TO WAIVE ITS IMMUNITY FROM SUIT: FIRST, BY FAILURE TO RAISE THE IMMUNITY AS A DEFENSE AT TRIAL; SECOND, BY PRIVATE AGREEMENT; AND THIRD, BY ACCEPTING FEDERAL BENEFITS MADE CONDITIONAL ON WAIVER OF IMMUNITY FROM FEDERAL CLAIMS. SHE DETERMINES THAT BECAUSE THE COURT'S SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND SPENDING CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH ENSURING THAT A STATE'S WAIVER IS VOLUNTARY AND UNEQUIVOCAL RATHER THAN COERCED, THIS CASE LAW PRECLUDES HOLDING THAT A STATE WAIVES ITS IMMUNITY BY MERELY FAILING TO RAISE IT AT TRIAL. SHE CONCLUDES, HOWEVER, THAT WHERE A STATE VOLUNTARILY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY WAIVES ITS IMMUNITY IN A PRIVATE CONTRACT OR IN EXCHANGE FOR BENEFITS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, ITS WAIVER SHOULD BE ENFORCED NOTWITHSTANDING A SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPT TO REVOKE IT AT OR BEFORE TRIAL. THUS, A WAIVER APPROACH TO STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY COULD PROVIDE A CONSTITUTIONAL WAY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO VINDICATE THEIR RIGHTS AGAINST THE STATES IN A NUMBER OF CASES, THEREBY NARROWING THE RIGHT-REMEDY GAP CREATED BY THE COURT'S ABROGATION DECISIONS.
873	THE USE OF ASCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIONS LEADS US TO THE THEORY OF CONSTRUCTING REALITY THROUGH THE USE OF LANGUAGE. SINCE NEW OBJECTS, SUCH AS GOALS IN FOOTBALL OR CRIMES, ARE INTRODUCED INTO ONTOLOGY BY ATTRIBUTING STATUSES, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE BASIS FOR THIS MECHANISM. THE PERFORMATIVE COMPONENT OF ASCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIONS, WHICH IS A ONE-TIME PERFORMANCE OF SEVERAL ACTIONS, IS DEFINED. FIRSTLY, THIS IS A CERTAIN ILLOCUTIONARY ACT. SECONDLY, IT IS DIRECTLY AN ASCRIPTIVE ACT, THAT IS, THE ACT OF ATTRIBUTING A CERTAIN STATUS TO A CERTAIN POSITION. THE BASIS FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THE ILLOCUTIONARY ACT IS THE INTENTION OF THE AGENT, WHILE THE BASIS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASCRIPTIVE ACT IS A CERTAIN RULE. IF IT IS THE ACT OF ATTRIBUTION, AND NOT THE ILLOCUTIONARY ACT, THAT IS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF REALITY, THEN IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUNDS FOR PERFORMING THIS KIND OF ACTION. SINCE THE QUESTION OF FOLLOWING THE RULE WHEN USING ASCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIONS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF LEGAL STATEMENTS HAS ALREADY BEEN RAISED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY OF LAW EARLIER, THE ANALYSIS BEGINS WITH THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE LEGAL LANGUAGE. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT A RULE OF LAW IS NOT ALWAYS A REGULATORY RULE. AT LEAST SOME OF THE LEGAL NORMS BELONG TO A CONSTITUTIVE RULE, THAT IS, A RULE THAT CREATES THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME NEW ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, THE EXPRESSIONS OF EVERYDAY LANGUAGE ARE CONSIDERED. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ACT OF ATTRIBUTION IS ALSO CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF CONSTITUTIVE RULES, FROM WHICH IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ONTOLOGY THROUGH THE USE OF ASCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIONS IS POSSIBLE WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL HAS A CORRESPONDING RULE. IN A SITUATION WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL MAKES A MISTAKE, AN OBJECT INTRODUCED INTO THE ONTOLOGY CAN BE "RECALLED", SINCE ASCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIONS HAVE THE PROPERTY OF CANCELLABILITY.
874	IN SOCIETIES WHERE IT HAS BEEN KNOWN AND APPLIED, BLOODFEUD IS DESCRIBED AS A POSSIBLY OUTDATED AND UNCIVILIZED MECHANISM, BUT OFTEN EFFECTIVE TO LIMIT VIOLENCE. INDEED, BOTH IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE THE PHENOMENON ITSELF IS HARD TO BE PERCEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE MODERN CITIZEN OF EVERY COUNTRY OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING ALBANIA, WHERE IT IS STILL ACTIVE IN SOME REGIONS IN RESPECT OF "KANUN". IN FACT, THE ALBANIAN TERM 'KANUN' DESCRIBES THE BODY OF TRADITIONAL NORMS/STANDARDS AND RULES GOVERNING SOCIETY IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL, CIVIL AND PROCEDURAL LAWS. ITS APPLICATION OR MERELY ITS EXISTENCE IN MORAL AND LEGAL STANDARDS MAKES A SOCIETY SAFER, CERTAINLY REFERRING TO A SOCIETY WHERE THE POWER OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY, NAMELY OF THE STATE, EITHER DID NOT EXIST OR LACKED. THE GREATEST ANTHROPOLOGICAL DILEMMA IS JUST THERE, WHY DOES KANUN WORK IN A MODERN STATE? IN SOCIETIES WHERE BLOOD FEUD HAS BEEN PRESENT AS A REGULATORY ELEMENT OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS IT IS ACCEPTED THAT ITS ABOLITION OR DECLINE OCCURRED ONLY WHEN ANOTHER SUBJECT (THE STATE), TOOK OVER TO INTERVENE IN THESE CONFLICTING RELATIONSHIPS, AND TO PROVIDE THE RESOLUTION AND REGULATION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS THROUGH ENFORCEMENT OF RULE OF LAW, OR THE PUBLIC ORDER. AND THE QUESTION ARISES BY ITSELF: WHY THE ALBANIAN STATE DID NOT TAKE OVER THE BLOOD FEUD SOLUTION BY USE OF PUBLIC ORDER? THE KANUN DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE STATE OR THE STATE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE KANUN? WHY? IT IS NOT EASY TO GET INTO SUCH HISTORIC AND SOCIAL DILEMMAS, BUT A MODEST EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE. THE ANSWER TO THIS FACT SHOULD BE FOUND BY THE HISTORY OF ALBANIA. AS A QUESTIONING REMARK, THE REASON FOR THE LONG LIFE OF KANUN, RATHER CALLED AS SELF-REGULATORY LAW OF THE SOCIETY, IS DUE TO THE HISTORIC ABSENCE OF A STATE ON THE SIDE AND INTERESTS OF ITS CITIZENS.
875	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE QUESTION OF HOW DECISION MAKERS WITH NO RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND CAN (IF AT ALL) LEGITIMATELY EVALUATE CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC EXPERT TESTIMONIES AND DETERMINE THEIR RELATIVE RELIABILITY. SCEPTICS ARGUE THAT NON-EXPERTS CAN NEVER REACH JUSTIFIABLE CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE MERITS OF CONFLICTING EXPERT TESTIMONIES BECAUSE THEY LACK THE FUNDAMENTAL EPISTEMIC CAPACITY TO MAKE SUCH JUDGEMENT CALLS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DRAW ON WORKS ON EPISTEMOLOGY, PHILOSOPHY OF PRACTICAL REASONING, PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES, AND LEGAL THEORY IN ORDER TO SCRUTINIZE RECENT PROPOSALS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC EXPERT TESTIMONIES. ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION IS OF ULTIMATE IMPORTANCE DUE TO THE IDEA THAT IMMANENT IN THE IDEA OF RULE-OF-LAW THERE IS AN INTELLECTUAL DUE PROCESS NORM, WHICH ARTICULATES THAT EPISTEMICALLY ARBITRARY LEGAL DECISIONS ARE ALSO NOT LEGALLY JUSTIFIED. THIS ARTICLE IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS. IN SECTION 2, I DESCRIBE THE BASIC PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRIES UNDERLYING THE DEBATE ABOUT EXPERT TESTIMONY. IN PARTICULAR, I FIRST ELABORATE ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF TESTIMONY AND ITS EPISTEMIC JUSTIFICATIONS, THEN MOVE TO THE IDEA OF EPISTEMIC DEFERENCE, AND FINISH WITH PHILOSOPHICAL ACCOUNTS OF EXPERTISE. SECTION 3 PRESENTS THE PROBLEM OF CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC EXPERT TESTIMONIES AND ANALYSES RECENT ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE IT AS FORMULATED BY WARD JONES, ALVIN GOLDMAN AND SCOTT BREWER. I ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE CRITERION (OR SET OF CRITERIA) UPON WHICH THE NON-EXPERT COULD RELY IN ORDER TO MAKE A RATIONALLY JUSTIFIED DECISION IN EACH AND EVERY CASE IN WHICH HE FACES CONFLICTING SCIENTIFIC EXPERT TESTIMONIES. THE ALTERNATIVE VIEW HERE DEFENDED IS TO STOP LOOKING FOR AN EPISTEMIC PANACEA AND ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT TESTIMONIAL RELIABILITY OPERATES DIFFERENTLY WITHIN DIFFERENT KINDS OF TESTIMONY-AND DIFFERENTLY WITHIN THE SAME KIND OF TESTIMONY AT DIFFERENT TIMES.
876	THIS PRESENTATION CONSIDERS PROGRESS TOWARDS ESTABLISHMENT OF A MODERN LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS IN CHINA. A BACKGROUND OF CURRENT LABOUR MARKET STATISTICS AND TRENDS IS PROVIDED, TOGETHER WITH COMMENT ON PERCEIVED IMPACTS FOR CHINA OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE 2008. RECENT ENACTMENTS DEALING WITH EMPLOYMENT PROMOTION, LABOUR CONTRACTS, AND LABOUR DISPUTE RESOLUTION ARE THEN CONSIDERED. THESE ARE SEEN AS A NEW PHASE IN REGULATORY ACTIVITY FOR THE WORLD OF WORK SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC IN 1949. PARTICULAR CHALLENGES ARE IDENTIFIED IN RELATION TO EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE MONITORING OF ENTERPRISE COMPLIANCE WITH LABOUR REGULATIONS, AND JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY IN DEALING WITH A RISING VOLUME OF LABOUR DISPUTES THROUGHOUT CHINA. THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARD-SETTING BODIES UPON THE NEW ENACTMENTS IS NOTED, AS ARE LESSONS DRAWN BY THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES FROM EXAMINATION OF EXPERIENCES IN OTHER NATIONAL SYSTEMS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT, WITHOUT DRAMATIC DEPARTURE FROM THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE 'UMBRELLA' LABOUR LAW OF 1994, RECENT CHINESE LEGISLATION REFLECTS SOME SOPHISTICATED AND INNOVATIVE DRAUGHTSMANSHIP, AS WELL AS SENSITIVITY TO THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF ENTERPRISES AND THE (GENERALLY PROTECTIVE) 'SOCIAL DIMENSION' OF THE WORLD OF WORK. CONCERN IS EXPRESSED, HOWEVER, AS TO WHETHER CHINA'S AVAILABLE ENFORCEMENT AND SANCTIONING MECHANISMS WILL SUFFICE TO ENSURE THAT THE NEW REGULATORY ARRANGEMENTS BECOME EFFECTIVE IN PRACTICE. NOTABLY, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR CAPACITY BUILDING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE LABOUR MARKET REGULATION WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF RULE OF LAW. THE NEED FOR A STABLE, WELL-REGULATED, YET FLEXIBLE, LABOUR MARKET IS SEEN AS CRUCIAL TO THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY AT A TIME OF DRAMATIC GLOBAL FLUX. CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM IS EXPRESSED AS TO THE PROSPECTS OF ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS.
877	PURPOSE RECENT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS IN DECLINE. IF SO, SOME ARGUE THAT THE APPROPRIATE POLICY RESPONSE IS TO DEVOTE EVEN FURTHER GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO NURTURE BOTH FLEDGLING VENTURES AS WELL AS ENTIRELY NEW UNDERTAKINGS, LAMENTING THE FACT THAT MUCH CURRENT ECONOMIC POLICY CATERS TO ALREADY-SUCCESSFUL FIRMS - THEREBY CREATING A DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENT THAT STACKS THE DECK AGAINST WOULD-BE ENTREPRENEURS. WHILE IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURES LEAD TO VALUE CREATION OVER TIME, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE ANSWER TO ANY SLOWDOWN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS NOT TO ADD EVEN MORE POLICY BAND-AIDS TO AN ALREADY BROKEN SYSTEM OF CARVE-OUTS, EXEMPTIONS, SUBSIDIES AND TAX BREAKS. INSTEAD THE SOLUTION TO BAD POLICY IS TO UNWIND BAD POLICY THAT FAVORS GOLIATHS OVER DAVIDS, THEREBY CREATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL. ANY ATTEMPT TO USE GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES TO SPUR ENTREPRENEURSHIP WILL, OVER THE LONGER TERM, ONLY SERVE TO DISTORT THE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES SOCIETY WOULD HAVE OBSERVED AS THE PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM OF RULE-OF-LAW, CLEARLY DEFINED AND ENFORCED PROPERTY RIGHTS AND FREELY FUNCTIONING MARKETS THAT PERMIT ENTREPRENEURS, INVESTORS, CONSUMERS AND SAVERS TO MAKE THE MOST SENSIBLE CHOICES AVAILABLE TO THEM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS ESSAY CITES FUNDAMENTAL PIECES OF EXISTING ENTREPRENEURIAL RESEARCH TO MAKE ITS ARGUMENT. FINDINGS RATHER THAN ADDING EVEN MORE POLICY INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS ANY SLOWDOWN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD ASPIRE TO CREATE THE MOST FERTILE ENVIRONMENT POSSIBLE TO FOSTER ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. ADDING MORE POLICIES ON TOP OF EXISTING ONES PRESUMES TO KNOW WHICH POLICIES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. EVEN WHEN PERCEIVED AS NEUTRAL, POLICY INCENTIVES CANNOT IMPROVE UPON THE OUTCOMES OF THE UNSEEN PRICE SYSTEM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER REMINDS READERS THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS VITAL TO ECONOMIC FLOURISHING, WHILE REMINDING READERS THAT EVEN POLICY ACTIONS PRESUMED TO BE BENEFICIAL LIKELY BEAR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE THEY BRING THEIR OWN DISRUPTIONS TO THE DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENT.
878	EVERY YEAR, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NONCITIZENS IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS ARE HELD AND PROCESSED THROUGH AN EXPANDING WEB OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE USE OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION IS EXPECTED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S MASS DEPORTATION POLICY. I ARGUE THAT THIS CIVIL CONFINEMENT SYSTEM MAY SERVE A CRITICAL SOCIO-LEGAL FUNCTION THAT HAS ESCAPED THE ATTENTION OF POLICYMAKERS, SCHOLARS, AND THE PUBLIC ALIKE. USING EXTENSIVE ORIGINAL DATA ON LONG-TERM IMMIGRANT DETAINEES, I EXPLORE HOW IMMIGRATION DETENTION MIGHT FUNCTION AS A SITE OF LEGAL SOCIALIZATION THAT HELPS TO PROMOTE OR REINFORCE WIDESPREAD LEGAL CYNICISM AMONG IMMIGRANT DETAINEES. THIS LEGAL CYNICISM IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE BELIEF THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS PUNITIVE DESPITE ITS PURPORTED ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION, LEGAL RULES ARE INSCRUTABLE BY DESIGN, AND LEGAL OUTCOMES ARE ARBITRARY. THESE FINDINGS ADVANCE THE STUDY OF DEMOCRACY, LEGITIMACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW WAY OF CONCEPTUALIZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THIS RECONCEPTUALIZATION RECOGNIZES NONCITIZENS NOT AS PASSIVE OBJECTS OF STATE CONTROL, BUT AS MORAL AGENTS WHO ARE CAPABLE OF NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE LAW AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. SECOND, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A FULLER AND MORE NUANCED PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION DETENTION'S SOCIETAL IMPACTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE FAR MORE WIDE-REACHING AND LONG-LASTING THAN COMMONLY ASSUMED. FOR EXAMPLE, IMMIGRANT DETAINEES, AS INDIVIDUALS EMBEDDED IN DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL NETWORKS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO WIDELY DISSEMINATE DEFERENCE AND TRUST, OR ALTERNATIVELY CYNICISM AND DELEGITIMATING BELIEFS, ABOUT THE U.S. LEGAL SYSTEM AND AUTHORITIES. TOGETHER, THESE CONTRIBUTIONS UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE SOCIALIZATION FUNCTION OF LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS FOR NONCITIZENS IN AN ERA OF INCREASING CROSS-BORDER MOVEMENT AND MIGRATION CONTROL.
879	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF FIRM-AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS ON THE DYNAMICS OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE FOR A NEW DATA SET OF FIRMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - PANEL DATA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES ARE CARRIED OUT ON A SET OF 412 FIRMS FROM 12 COUNTRIES WITHIN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FIRM-AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CHOICE OF DEBT FOR FIRMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. FIRST, FIRM PROFITABILITY IS THE MOST COMMON SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE FOR FIRMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE SIGNIFICANCE AND MAGNITUDE OF PROFITABILITY COEFFICIENTS IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WITH THE LEAST DEVELOPED BANKING AND STOCK MARKETS AND THE WEAKEST LEGAL SYSTEMS. SECOND, THE RULE OF LAW IN NIGERIA AND ZIMBABWE PROVIDES AVENUES FOR FIRMS IN THESE COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURES. THE CHOICE OF DEBT FOR FIRMS IN GHANA IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS, THE TIME TO ENFORCE A CONTRACT AND THE COST OF CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT. THIRD, CAPITAL STRUCTURE ADJUSTMENT SPEEDS IN ALL THE SAMPLED COUNTRIES ARE RELATIVELY SLOW, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE MARKET IMPERFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERDEVELOPED FINANCIAL MARKETS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. LASTLY, FIRMS IN THE MOST DEVELOPED STOCK MARKETS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA TEND TO HAVE LOWER MEAN DEBT RATIOS AND FASTER CAPITAL STRUCTURE ADJUSTMENT SPEEDS. SIMILARLY, FIRMS IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG LEGAL MECHANISMS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER MEAN LONG-TERM DEBT RATIOS AND FASTER CAPITAL STRUCTURE ADJUSTMENT SPEEDS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF FIRM-LEVEL AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS ON THE DYNAMICS OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE FOR A NEW DATA SET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY IGNORED IN THE LITERATURE.
880	ON NOVEMBER 30, 2022, OPENAI LAUNCHED CHATGPT CONVERSATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; WITH THE LATEST VERSION UPDATE, CHATGPT HAS DEMONSTRATED AN IMPRESSIVE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND NATURAL LANGUAGE, MAKING IT AN ATTRACTIVE TOOL FOR COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS LOOKING TO PROVIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT. GPT-3 USES TEXTUAL DATA, MOSTLY FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, AS TRAINING DATA. GPT-4, ON THE OTHER HAND, USES A LARGE NUMBER OF IMAGES IN ADDITION TO TEXTUAL DATA FOR TRAINING, AND THUS CAN PROCESS BOTH TEXTUAL AND GRAPHICAL DATA. THE EMERGENCE OF GENERATIVE AI HAS GREATLY IMPACTED HUMAN LIFE, BUT IT CAN BE SAID THAT INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD:RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TECHNOLOGIES, ON THE ONE HAND, IT CAN IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY, REDUCE COSTS AND OPEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THE USE OF GENERATIVE AI SERVICES TO CREATE SYNTHETIC CONTENT IN THE FORM OF TEXT, AUDIO, VIDEO AND IMAGES POSES POSSIBLE RISKS. TO DATE, DIFFERENT REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD ARE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF NORMATIVE ACTS CONCERNING GENERATIVE AI.USING THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD AND THE METHOD OF SYSTEM ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES IN DETAIL THE MAIN MODELS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE MODERN WORLD ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE UK, THE USA, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CHINA, NOTING THE DIFFERENT APPROACH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF RELEVANT NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS IN THE FIELD OF REGULATION OF GENERATIVE AI SERVICES.IT ESPECIALLY REVEALS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON "DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY" AND "INNOVATION AND GOVERNANCE" AT PRESENT. THE MAIN TRENDS OF IMPROVING THE REGULATION OF GENERATIVE AI SERVICES BY CHINA ARE PROPOSED, AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO BALANCE "RULE OF LAW" AND "INNOVATION" AND PROMOTE THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF GENERATIVE AI.
881	STARTING FROM THE TWO DIMENSIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH-MUTUAL COHERENCE OF STATEMENTS AND THE CORRESPONDENCE OF STATEMENTS WITH SOCIAL REALITY-THE PAPER ANALYSES CROATIAN PUBLIC POLICY GOALS BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE STATE'S STRATEGIC DOCUMENTS. AFTER PRESENTING TWO SELECTED CATEGORIES OF SECTORAL OBJECTIVES (SOCIAL INCLUSION AND EMPOWERMENT; WELFARE AND PREVENTION) AND FOUR CATEGORIES OF VALUE OBJECTIVES OF PUBLIC POLICIES (DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY; EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS; JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW; NON-VIOLENCE), TOGETHER WITH EXAMPLES FROM THE NATIONAL STRATEGIES, POTENTIAL TENSIONS ARE DETECTED BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF MUTUAL COHERENCE OF PUBLIC POLICY GOALS AND THEIR CORRESPONDENCE AT THE LEVEL OF THEIR FEASIBILITY AND THE RELATED SOCIAL DYNAMICS. AT THE LEVEL OF COHERENCE, THESE ARE: CONFLICT BETWEEN INSISTING ON EMANCIPATION AND ENCOURAGING EMANCIPATION "FROM ABOVE" BY THE STATE; TENSION BETWEEN UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE ONE HAND AND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY, EQUALITY, AND GROUP RIGHTS AT THE LEVEL OF THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY ON THE OTHER; THE PROBLEM OF RECIPROCITY OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES IN POLITICAL SYSTEMS, AND THE PARADOX OF NON-VIOLENCE DEMANDING STATE VIOLENCE TO BE ESTABLISHED. AT THE LEVEL OF CORRESPONDENCE, THESE ARE: CONFLICT BETWEEN THE INCREASE IN THE SCOPE OF RIGHTS THAT THE STATE MUST PROVIDE IN THE CONTEXT OF UNFA-VOURABLE DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, THE SPECIFIC DIALECTIC OF RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS IN PRACTICE THAT DISCOURAGES AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENT AND SUBSI-DIARY SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS, THE LOGIC OF NON-VIOLENCE THAT POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THE SECURITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF A POLITICAL ORDER. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE SUGGESTED LACK OF MUTUAL COHERENCE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF PUBLIC POLICIES WITH SOCIAL TRENDS MAKES THEIR GOALS TOO AMBITIOUS AND POTENTIALLY DYSTOPIAN, ESPECIALLY IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF NEGATIVELY UNDERSTOOD POLITICAL LIBERTY, IN OTHER WORDS-FREEDOM.
882	IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF RAPID GLOBAL URBANIZATION, CHINA'S URBANIZATION IS ALSO ACCELERATING, AND THE RATIONAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF STATE LAND AND SPACE HAVE BECOME A GROWING CONCERN. THE EXPANSION OF URBAN GEOGRAPHIC SPACE IS INEVITABLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE MASSIVE EXPROPRIATION OF RURAL LAND. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE, FROM A JURISPRUDENCE PERSPECTIVE, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES LAND EXPROPRIATION IN URBANIZATION HAS CAUSED SPECIAL SACRIFICES TO FARMERS AND WHAT COMPENSATION STANDARDS HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY THE CHINESE COURTS AFTER THE SPECIAL SACRIFICES HAVE BEEN CAUSED. TO ACHIEVE THIS RESEARCH OBJECTIVE, THE AUTHORS FIRST IDENTIFIED THE CAUSAL RELATION BETWEEN THE EXPANSION OF URBANIZATION AND CONFLICTS OVER LAND EXPROPRIATION IN CHINA THROUGH THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS METHOD, AND FOUND THAT THE EXPANSION OF URBAN GEOGRAPHIC SPACE HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN CONFLICTS OVER LAND EXPROPRIATION AND THAT THE LAND EXPROPRIATION COMPENSATION SYSTEM IS THE KEY TO ALLEVIATING SUCH CONFLICTS. SECONDLY, BY INTERPRETING AND SUMMARIZING THE COMPENSATION STANDARDS FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION IN CHINA'S LEGISLATION TEXTS AND JUDICIAL JUDGMENTS THROUGH NORMATIVE ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE COMPENSATION STANDARDS FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION CURRENTLY ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE'S COURTS OF CHINA ARE PLURALISTIC AND CONFLICT WITH THOSE IN THE LEGISLATION TEXT. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT IF LAND EXPROPRIATION IN URBANIZATION LEADS TO AN INFRINGEMENT OF CIVIL LIBERTIES WHICH RESULTS IN A SPECIAL SACRIFICE OF CITIZENS, SUCH SPECIAL SACRIFICE SHOULD BE JUSTLY COMPENSATED. TO EFFECTIVELY MITIGATE THE CONFLICTS CONCERNING LAND EXPROPRIATION IN THE URBANIZATION PROCESS, CHINA SHOULD BUILD A UNIFIED COMPENSATION STANDARD FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF LEGISLATIVE TEXT IN THE FUTURE, ACHIEVE A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE DOCTRINAL AND PRACTICAL COMPENSATION STANDARDS FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION, AND SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW TO GUARANTEE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF URBANIZATION.
883	ISSUES OF POLICE CONTROL AND INVOLVEMENT ARE OF GREAT ESSENCE WHEN ASPECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE REVEALED. THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE IS NO WAY OR INSTANCES WHERE THE LEGITIMATE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOM CAN BE GUARANTEED WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE POLICE IN ENSURING THAT RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED THROUGH THE RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ONLY WAY THIS PROTECTION CAN BE MAINTAINED IS ONLY THROUGH THE OPERATION OR APPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. WHEN DEALING WITH THE CONCEPT OF POLICE LAW, EMPHASIS IS LAID ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE WHEN DEALING WITH MATTERS RELATED TO STATE SECURITY, PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL LIVING IN A GIVEN SOCIETY, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THE ENTIRE PUBLIC. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT IS THE ROLE OF THE POLICE TO MAINTAIN PEACE AND SECURITY WITHIN A GIVEN SOCIETY, BUT THE QUESTION WE SHOULD BE POSING IS WHETHER THEIR FUNCTIONS PERFORMED ARE DONE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF RESPECTING FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, FOLLOWING THE DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW BEING THE FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPERATIVE BASIS OR ESSENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. ONE THING IS TO ENSURE SECURITY, AND THE OTHER ONE IS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN ENFORCING THIS SECURITY, FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE RESPECTED BY THE SUPPOSED CALLED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. IT IS THEREFORE IN THIS LIGHT THAT ONE CAN SAY, WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONING, THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD POLICE LAW FUNCTION WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, BOTH MOST COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER, AND ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICE MUST BE DONE IN STRICT RESPECT AND COMPLIANCE WITH THAT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES IS THE PREREQUISITE OBJECTIVE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, IN WHICH THE POLICE LAW MUST OBSERVE AND RESPECT.
884	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) IS A PRAISED AND PROMOTED BUSINESS BEHAVIOR NOWADAYS, WIDELY UNDERSTOOD AS THE ENTREPRENEURS' AND MANAGERS' ATTEMPTS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR SOME OF THE EXCESSES THAT THEIR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES BRING ABOUT, FOR INSTANCE WITH REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OR TO PUBLIC ECOLOGICAL ASSETS UNDER-PROVISION. IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO DULY PROCESS AND PROFESS THE CSR CONCEPT, ONE PLACED AT A SUBTLE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BUSINESS PROFITABILITY AND CIVIC/SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND ETHICAL/LEGAL REALMS, SINCE THE MISREPRESENTATION OF ECONOMIC AGENTS' BENCHMARK OF PROPER CONDUCT MIGHT HARM BOTH SOCIAL LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT. STILL, DESPITE ITS RICH OCCURRENCE IN SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AS WELL AS RECURRENCE IN BUSINESS PRACTICES, CSR REQUIRES BOTH FURTHER AND THOROUGH CLARIFICATION, SINCE MANY STUDIES POSTULATE THAT THE FREE-MARKET MINDSET IS RATHER DISMISSIVE OF CSR SOLICITUDES. THE CURRENT RESEARCH PAPER FILLS SUCH A SENSITIVE CONCEPTUAL GAP BY EXPLAINING WHY CSR REGARDS ARE LOGICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE FREE MARKETS, WITH NO REASON TO DECREE A MARKET FAILURE IN THIS MATTER. THE WORK TAKES THE FORM OF AN ANALYTICAL RESEARCH, OF AN EXPLICITLY CONCEPTUAL NATURE, BASED ON PRAXEOLOGICALLY-DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTATION, DOCUMENTING THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPATIBILITY OF CSR WITH THE FREE MARKET ORDER, POPULATED BY PROFIT-DRIVEN CAPITALIST CORPORATIONS THAT, FAR FROM BEING RECKLESS, ARE DISCIPLINED BY THE RULE OF LAW OF CLEARLY DEFINED, DEFENDED, DIVESTIBLE PROPERTY RIGHTS. AS SUCH, THE PLEA ADOPTED THE METHODOLOGICAL ACQUIS OF THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS. THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY REVEAL THAT (A) IN ECONOMIC COMMONSENSE, THE "PROFIT MOTIVE" IS THE PRIMA FACIA RULE OF JUDICIOUSNESS AS THE CARE FOR THIRD-PARTIES' WELFARE CAN BE ENSURED ONLY AFTER OWN WELL-BEING HAS BEEN SECURED, WHILE (B) ETHICALLY, "SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY", AS AN EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL DUTY, DOES BUILD UP ON TOP OF, NOT AS TRADE-OFF WITH A ROBUST PROPERTY RIGHTS ORDER.
885	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LEGITIMACY, LEGITIMACY AND LEGALITY, AND LEGITIMIZATION OF POWER IN RELATION TO THE PERIOD OF MONARCHICAL RULE, BASED ON THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL PLATFORM OF N.M. KARAMZIN, WHO WAS AT THE ORIGINS OF RUSSIAN CONSERVATISM. THE SYSTEM OF LEGITIMISM REPRESENTED IN HISTORY NOT ONLY THE HISTORICAL RIGHT OF POWER TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF THE STATE AND DEFEND SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL BORDERS, AND JUSTIFY THE LEGITIMACY OF DYNASTIC POWER, BUT ALSO THE LEGITIMACY OF POWER IN GENERAL. THE AUTHORS' ANALYSIS OF N.M. KARAMZIN'S VIEWS TOUCHES ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF MONARCHICAL LEGITIMATION. THE AUTOCRACY OF THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMISM IS THE ROOT PRINCIPLE OF THE RUSSIAN STATE ORDER. THE HISTORIAN PROPOSED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REPUBLICAN IDEAS THROUGH A MONARCHICAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT, WHILE ADVOCATING THE COMBINATION OF THE PATRIMONIAL MODEL OF POWER AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF N.M. KARAMZIN, THE LEGALITY IS COMPATIBLE WITH ANY METHOD OF GOVERNMENT. ANY STATE IS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT AUTOCRACY IN ITS UNDERSTANDING CONTRADICT THE NATURAL NATURE OF RUSSIAN LAW, LEAD TO LAWLESSNESS AND ANARCHY. HE RECOGNIZED THE FREEDOM OF MAN WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE LAWS. N.M. KARAMZIN CONSIDERED LEGITIMISM IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE AS LOYALTY TO THE ROOT LAWS AND THE TRUTH OF THE MONARCHY. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE POSITION OF N. M. KARAMZIN CAN BE CALLED A POLITICAL AND LEGAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE MONARCHICAL POWER. HIS VIEWS WERE THE STARTING POINT FOR SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS ON INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES TO THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY. THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE PUBLICATION WAS N. M. KARAMZIN'S WORK "A NOTE ON ANCIENT AND NEW RUSSIA IN ITS POLITICAL AND CIVIL RELATIONS".
886	IN PRINCIPLE, CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS REQUIRE COURTS TO DEAL WITH ACTIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY. BUT THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO LET ORDINARY COURTS APPLY THE STANDARD RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE IN SMALL CLAIMS CASES. RATHER, IT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD THAT PETTY LITIGATION RAISES PARTICULAR PROBLEMS AND DESERVES SPECIAL SOLUTIONS. THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DESIGN SUCH ORGANIZATIONAL AND/OR PROCEDURAL RULES SEEMS TO GAIN MOMENTUM PERPETUALLY AND ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS. A COMPARATIVE AND HISTORICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS AN AMAZING VARIETY OF APPROACHES AND SOLUTIONS, I.E. SMALL CLAIMS COURTS, SMALL CLAIMS TRACKS AND SMALL CLAIMS PROCEDURES. WHEN PROVIDING SPECIAL RULES FOR SMALL CLAIMS DISPUTES, LAW-MAKERS NORMALLY PURPORT TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT TRY TO CUT COSTS. THE LATTER AIM, HOWEVER, IS NOT TO BE DISREGARDED SINCE AFFORDABILITY OF JUSTICE IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE; MOREOVER, THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING THAT PROCEDURAL RULES WHICH EMERGED BY NECESSITY RATHER THAN BY DESIGN MAY STAND THE TEST OF TIME. YET ONE SHOULD ACCEPT THAT BOTH GOALS - REMOVING BARRIERS TO JUSTICE AND RELIEVING THE BURDEN ON THE JUSTICE SYSTEM - ARE UNLIKELY TO BE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVED: YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT. BOTH AIMS CAN BE REACHED ONLY IF ONE IS WILLING TO CUT DOWN ON THE QUALITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE (IN PARTICULAR AS REGARDS FACT-FINDING, THE LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF THE CASE AND THE RESPONDENT'S RIGHTS TO DEFEND). BUT IN A SYSTEM GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, THIS IS NO LESS ACCEPTABLE THAN THE CONVERSE, I.E. RESTRICTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE AS A MEANS OF COST-EFFICIENTLY PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SYSTEM TO A REDUCED NUMBER OF LAWSUITS. HIGH STANDARDS OF ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE COME AT A PRICE: A REASONABLY FUNDED AND ELABORATED JUDICIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE EVEN FOR SMALL CLAIMS.
887	THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA (ICTR) WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE UN IN 1995. FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS, IT HAD TO DEAL WITH NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMES THAT TOOK PLACE IN RWANDA IN 1994. IN 2015, THE ICTR FINALLY CLOSED ITS DOORS. FROM A SCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW IT IS OF OUTMOST IMPORTANCE TO ANALYSE AND CRITICALLY REFLECT THE WORK OF THE ICTR SINCE THIS OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW IN ACTION. THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE SENTENCING PRACTICE OF THE ICTR. BESIDES THE CONSISTENCY OF ITS VERDICTS IT WILL BE ANALYSED WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURAL RIGHTS WERE ENSURED BY THE ICTR WHEN IMPOSING CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. THESE TWO ASPECTS PERCEIVED JUSTICE OF THE PROCEDURES LEADING TO A SENTENCE AND PERCEIVED JUSTICE OF THE SANCTION ITSELF REPRESENT IMPORTANT FACTORS STRONGLY INFLUENCING THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY AND ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW. GLOBAL ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS LEADING TO A SANCTION AS WELL AS THE VERDICTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LEGITIMATE, LAWFUL AND JUST. SUCH A GLOBAL ACCEPTANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE OF THE EFFICACY OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW AND AS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL JUSTICE. THE ANALYSIS OF THE SENTENCING PRACTICE OF THE ICTR PRESENTED HER IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF ALL OF ITS VERDICTS. SOME HIGHLY IMPORTANT SHORTCOMINGS AND PROBLEMS REGARDING VIOLATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES EMBEDDED IN SANCTIONING DECISIONS OF THE ICTR COULD BE IDENTIFIED. BUILDING ON THE RESULTS OF THESE ASSESSMENTS OF THE SANCTIONING DECISIONS OF THE ICTR MORE GENERAL FUTURE PERSPECTIVES FOR OPTIMIZING THE PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SANCTIONING DECISIONS ARE OUTLINED.
888	EVER SINCE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT OPENED IN HELSINKI IN 1973, THE UNITED STATES HAS REGARDED THE CONFERENCE (LATER ORGANIZATION) ON SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE WITH SOME AMBIVALENCE. THE ROLE OF THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT IN ESTABLISHING A NORMATIVE REGIME THAT CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO UNDERMINING THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES IN THE FORMER WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES, EVENTUALLY BRINGING AN END TO THE COLD WAR, IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AND APPRECIATED IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE EXPANDED POST-COLD WAR ROLE OF THE OSCE HAS RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION IN US FOREIGN POLICY AND, WITH RESPECT TO ISSUES OF EUROPEAN SECURITY, HAS CLEARLY BEEN ASSIGNED A SECONDARY ROLE IN THAT POLICY BEHIND THE NATO ALLIANCE. THOSE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE OSCE IN THE UNITED STATES WIDELY REGARD ITS ROLE IN POSITIVE TERMS ON ISSUES SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, RIGHTS OF PERSONS BELONGING TO MINORITIES, RULE OF LAW, ELECTION MONITORING AND OTHER "SOFT" SECURITY ISSUES. HOWEVER, THE OSCE ROLE IN "HARD" SECURITY ISSUES HAS BEEN GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION AND RECEIVES ONLY LIMITED SUPPORT, DUE LARGELY TO ITS INABILITY TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS ON MOST SERIOUS SECURITY PROBLEMS AND ITS LACK OF RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THOSE DECISIONS THAT IT TAKES. NEVERTHELESS, THE RECENT CRISIS IN UKRAINE HAS AWAKENED US INTEREST IN THE OSCE AS THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK BEST ABLE TO MANAGE THAT CRISIS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE GERMAN CHAIRMANSHIP IN 2016 WILL BE TO BUILD UPON THIS RENEWED US ATTENTION TO THE OSCE'S ROLE IN "HARD" SECURITY ISSUES, IN PROMOTING NEGOTIATED RESOLUTIONS TO THIS AND OTHER STALEMATED -CONFLICTS, IN REBUILDING THE BADLY DAMAGED REGIME OF CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES AND CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL, AS WELL AS RESPONDING, WITHIN THE MULTILATERAL OSCE FRAMEWORK, TO NEW SECURITY THREATS, SUCH AS CYBER WARFARE AND COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM.
889	OVER FIFTY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF JOHN RAWLS' PAPER 'TWO CONCEPTS OF RULES' (1955). THE PAPER REMAINS A UNIQUE WORK. RAWLS' SEMINAL 'DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUSTIFYING A PRACTICE AND JUSTIFYING A PARTICULAR ACTION FALLING UNDER IT' (1955: 3) PROVIDES US WITH A POWERFUL ANALYTIC PROPOSITION THAT CAN HAVE EXTENSIVE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, AS I SEEK TO DEMONSTRATE BELOW. IN FOOTNOTE 1 ON PAGE 3, RAWLS STATES THAT 'PRACTICE' IS A TECHNICAL TERM THAT REFERS TO 'ANY FORM OF ACTIVITY SPECIFIED BY A SYSTEM OF RULES WHICH DEFINES OFFICES, ROLES, MOVES, PENALTIES, DEFENSES, AND SO ON, AND WHICH GIVES THE ACTIVITY ITS STRUCTURE. AS EXAMPLES ONE MAY THINK OF GAMES AND RITUALS, TRIALS AND PARLIAMENTS.' RAWLS' PHILOSOPHICAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEFEND UTILITARIANISM VIS-A-VIS 'PUNISHMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS TO KEEP PROMISES.' THE GENERAL IDEA WAS TO PROVIDE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF A RULE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT IS DEFENSIBLE. THE NOTION OF TWO CONCEPTIONS OF RULES IS CENTRAL TO HIS DISCUSSION. I ASK: CAN RAWLS' UNIQUE ANALYTICAL NOTION OF TWO CONCEPTS OF RULES BE CLARIFIED BY EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES? I PRESENT SOME RECENT DATA FROM A CRIMINAL JUSTICE CASE TO ILLUSTRATE THE NOTION'S POTENTIAL AND LIMITATIONS. THE EMPIRICAL CIRCUM STANCES ARE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC. THE CASE INVOLVED AN ALLEGATION OF INTERRACIAL SEXUAL MOLESTATION AND TWO COUNTS OF GRAND THEFT. THE SEXUAL MOLESTATION ALLEGATION IS A THEME AT THE HEART OF DEEP-SEATED CULTURAL TENSIONS BETWEEN CAUCASIANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO INITIAL IMPORTATION OF SLAVES FROM AFRICA. THE INTER-RACIAL SEXUAL MOLESTATION ALLEGATION WAS DOCUMENTED IN DETAIL BY TWO LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUT WAS NEVER PURSUED. ONCE MAJOR CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DECISION WAS TO RENDER EMPIRICALLY PROBLEMATIC THE ISSUE OF WHEN A CASE IS SAID TO FALL UNDER A RULE OF LAW.
890	THE SO-CALLED "THIRD WAVE" OF DEMOCRATIZATION THAT HAS SWEPT THROUGH THE AFRICAN CONTINENT SINCE THE 1990S UNLEASHED IN ITS WAKE SOME SORT OF EPIDEMIC OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING. TODAY, THE NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED CONSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN INTRODUCED IN MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT PURPORT TO RECOGNIZE AND PROTECT MOST OF THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM AND WESTERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, WITH ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS BEING THE RECOGNITION OF POLITICAL PLURALISM AND THE LEGALIZATION OF PREVIOUSLY BANNED POLITICAL PARTIES. HOWEVER, THE HIGH HOPES THAT WERE RAISED ARE FADING BECAUSE THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DOMINANT PARTIES THAT HAVE REPLACED THE PRE-1990 ONE PARTY REGIMES HAVE EITHER PROGRESSIVELY ADOPTED LEGISLATION, POLICIES AND MEASURES DESIGNED TO ENTRENCH THEMSELVES IN POWER OR, SIMPLY MAINTAINED THEIR FOOTHOLD ON POWER THROUGH RIGGED ELECTIONS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE POSSIBLE ROLE THAT CONSTITUTIONALIZING POLITICAL PARTIES CAN PLAY IN CHECKING MAJORITARIAN ABUSES IN AFRICAN POLITIES BY LOOKING AT THE DIVERSE CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES AND PRACTICES IN SELECTED SOUTHERN AFRICA COUNTRIES TO SEE WHAT LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED. IT ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEMS OF THE LAST DECADE HAVE BEEN LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION ON WHICH POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE EXERCISED, ESPECIALLY THE BASIS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, IS WEAK AND FLAWED, THUS COMPROMISING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEWLY-RECOGNIZED RIGHTS TO ASSOCIATE, VOTE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE STATE. IT IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED THAT CONSTITUTIONALIZING THE STATUS OF POLITICAL PARTIES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF CERTAIN BASIC AND LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE PRINCIPLES THAT WILL ENSURE A FAIR AND JUST OUTCOME TO COMPETITIVE POLITICAL PROCESSES WILL ENABLE THEM TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENHANCING THE PROSPECTS FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA'S FALTERING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS REVOLUTION.
891	PANDEMIC FINANCING HAS IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE OF DISRUPTION AND TURMOIL OF AN ONGOING GLOBAL PANDEMIC BECOME THE MOST HIGHLY DEBATED AND CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE WITHIN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH LAW AND POLICY. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH LAW AND POLICY, A PRECONDITION FOR SUCCESS IS THAT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND FUNDS ARE EMPLOYED IN AN EFFECTIVE MANNER. WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (WORLD BANK' OR WB') AND THE PANDEMIC EMERGENCY FINANCING FACILITY (`PEF') -A FINANCING MECHANISM HOUSED AT THE WB -MAY BE PERCEIVED AS EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH PLAYERS SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY REFERRING TO THEIR MANDATES, THEIR INHERENT CAPACITY FOR ENHANCING ACCEPTED GLOBAL LEGAL STANDARDS AND RULES ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THEIR FUNDING METHODS AND PRACTICES. AFTER THE AFFIRMATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF ITS ROLE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR IN THE EARLY 199OS, THE WB HAS RAPIDLY ACCREDITED ITSELF AS THE MOST ACTIVE INTERGOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTION DEALING WITH PANDEMIC AND EPIDEMIC FINANCING. ITS DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH TRUST FUNDS, SUCH AS THE AVIAN FLU TRUST FUND FACILITY AND THE HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE MULTI-DONOR FUND (THE HEPRF), AND ITS LENDING PRACTICES AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE OF CRUCIAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THIS RESPECT CONSIDERING THAT ACCEPTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONDITIONED BY THEIR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AS LEGALLY LEGITIMATE, LEGITIMACY IS REGARDED AS CLOSELY CONNECTED TO EFFECTIVENESS. THE CRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHING LEGITIMACY IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY, AMONGST OTHERS, THE RESPECT AND PROMOTION OF RULE OF LAW STANDARDS IN THE RECIPIENT STATES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE WB'S FUNCTIONAL AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES, BUT NOT THE PEF'S STRUCTURES AND MANAGEMENT, HAVE MADE NOTEWORTHY PROGRESS, AND NOTWITHSTANDING SOME DEFICIENCIES AND PECULIARITIES THEY PRESENT SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF LEGITIMATE DECISION-MAKING.
892	DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH, AND OBSERVATIONS OF, OFFICIALS FROM ISRAEL'S NATURE AND PARK AUTHORITY, FIELDWORKERS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS NONPROFITS, AND LOCAL PALESTINIAN FARMERS, THIS ARTICLE TELLS STORIES ABOUT SPRINGS IN THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK. ENTANGLED WITH THE PHYSICAL DECLINE OF THE SPRINGS' WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY, IT EXAMINES THIS WATERWORLD ALSO IN A BROADER SENSE, WHICH INCLUDES CULTURAL, POLITICAL, AND RELIGIOUS-WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON LEGAL-SPRING-RELATED PRACTICES. AFTER DISCUSSING THE RELEVANT WATER AND LAND REGIMES WITHIN WHICH SPRINGS EXIST, AND THEIR SOCIO-GEOLOGICAL UNIQUENESS, I PAUSE TO TELL THE STORY OF EIN KELT-A DESERT SPRING ON THE WAY FROM JERUSALEM TO JERICHO. NEXT, I MOVE TO DISCUSS A VARIETY OF COLONIAL DISPOSSESSION TACTICS AT WORK IN THE WEST BANK SPRINGS. IN MANY CASES, SUCH TACTICS ARE PERFORMED BY JEWISH SETTLERS WITH THE TACIT SUPPORT OF ISRAELI AUTHORITIES. INSPIRED BY LEGAL GEOGRAPHY SCHOLARSHIP ON THE COPRODUCTION OF LAW AND MATTER, I EXAMINE ISRAEL'S SEEMINGLY PARADOXICAL PREOCCUPATION WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF SPRINGS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, WHAT I REFER TO HERE AS A HYPERLEGALITY, ON THE ONE HAND, AND ITS DISREGARD OF FORMAL LAW IN THE FACE OF SETTLER MISCONDUCT AT THESE SITES, ON THE OTHER HAND. COMPLICATING THE STORY, I ALSO DESCRIBE RECENT SPRING-BASED PRACTICES OF PURIFICATION CARRIED OUT BY JEWISH HASIDIC GROUPS. THE SPRINGS NEWLY EMERGE IN THIS CONTEXT AS SITES OF RECREATION, PILGRIMAGE, AND PURITY. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THEY ARE BECOMING PLACES OF DANGER FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND ARE INCREASINGLY FIGURING IN THE MOBILIZATION OF PALESTINIAN PROTEST. AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE, ONE IS LEFT WONDERING WHETHER WATER IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT FROM LAND AND SOIL. COULD SPRINGS POSSIBLY SERVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOCIO-MATERIAL FOUNDATION THAT MOVES AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL COLONIAL REGIMES?
893	THE CONSEQUENCES OF JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH'S SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION ARE SEISMIC. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, REPLACING JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY, COMPLETES A NEW CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY AND REPRESENTS A STUNNING REPUBLICAN VICTORY AFTER DECADES OF INCREASINGLY PARTISAN BATTLES OVER CONTROL OF THE COURT. THE RESULT IS A SUPREME COURT WHOSE JUSTICES ARE LIKELY TO VOTE ALONG PARTY LINES MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN EVER BEFORE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THAT DEVELOPMENT GRAVELY THREATENS THE COURT'S LEGITIMACY. IF IN THE FUTURE ROUGHLY HALF OF AMERICANS LACK CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURT'S ABILITY TO RENDER IMPARTIAL JUSTICE, THE COURT'S POWER TO SETTLE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF LAW WILL BE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY. MOREOVER, MANY DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY CALLING FOR CHANGES LIKE COURT-PACKING TO PREVENT THE NEW CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY FROM BLOCKING PROGRESSIVE REFORMS. EVEN IF JUSTIFIED, SUCH MOVES COULD PROVOKE FURTHER ESCALATION THAT WOULD LEAVE THE COURT'S IMAGE AND THE RULE OF LAW BADLY DAMAGED. THE COMING CRISIS CAN BE STOPPED. BUT SAVING THE COURT'S LEGITIMACY AS AN INSTITUTION ABOVE POLITICS WILL REQUIRE A RADICAL RETHINKING OF HOW THE COURT HAS OPERATED FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES. IN THIS FEATURE, WE OUTLINE A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR SUPREME COURT REFORM. SPECIFICALLY, WE ARGUE FOR REFORMS THAT ARE PLAUSIBLY CONSTITUTIONAL (AND THUS IMPLEMENTABLE BY STATUTE) AND THAT ARE CAPABLE OF CREATING A STABLE EQUILIBRIUM EVEN IF INITIALLY IMPLEMENTED USING "HARDBALL" TACTICS. UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK, WE EVALUATE EXISTING PROPOSALS AND OFFER TWO OF OUR OWN: THE SUPREME COURT LOTTERY AND THE BALANCED BENCH. WHETHER POLICYMAKERS ADOPT THESE PRECISE PROPOSALS OR NOT, OUR FRAMEWORK CAN GUIDE THEIR MUCH-NEEDED SEARCH FOR REFORM. WE CAN SAVE WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THE COURT-BUT ONLY IF WE ARE WILLING TO TRANSFORM THE COURT.
894	TOGETHER WITH THE BETTER-KNOWN CHEVRON DEFERENCE RULE, THE DOCTRINE ARTICULATED IN AUER V. ROBBINS TWO DECADES AGO-WHICH MAKES REASONABLE ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF AMBIGUOUS ADMINISTRATIVE RULES BINDING ON COURTS IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES-HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT FOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXPANDING ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. AUER DEFERENCE, EVEN MORE THAN CHEVRON DEFERENCE, ENLARGES ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY IN WAYS THAT ARE AT ODDS WITH BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AND DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. OBJECTIONS TO AUER HAVE PROVIDED COGENT REASONS FOR WHY COURTS SHOULD NOT GRANT DEFERENCE TO ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS MERELY BECAUSE AN AGENCY'S RULE IS UNCLEAR. THE MOST COMMONLY VOICED OBJECTIONS, HOWEVER, DO NOT EXPLAIN WHY CONGRESS SHOULD BE DISABLED IN ALL INSTANCES FROM GRANTING ADMINISTRATORS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY OVER RULE INTERPRETATION-EVEN IN SETTINGS THAT DO NOT RAISE SERIOUS RISKS OF PARTIALITY OR UNFAIR SURPRISE IN ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRUCTION. EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATUTORILY DIRECTED DEFERENCE AND CONSTITUTIONAL-STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES CLARIFIES THE ESSENTIAL UNDERLYING OBJECTION TO AUER AND THE LIMITS OF THAT OBJECTION. WHEN CONGRESS BY LAW CONFERS DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY THAT DOES NOT EXCEED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO DELEGATE FUNCTIONS TO AN ADMINISTRATOR, COURTS SHOULD RESPECT THAT ASSIGNMENT OF AUTHORITY, UNLESS IT VIOLATES OTHER SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL COMMANDS. YET, WHEN DELEGATIONS ARE AT MOST ONLY ARGUABLY CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION, EXTENDING DEFERENCE-ESPECIALLY EXPANDING DEFERENCE AS AUER DOES IN SUCCESSIVE DETERMINATIONS-EXACERBATES DELEGATIONS' DIFFICULTIES. A REINVIGORATED NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE WOULD SOLVE THE MAJOR AUER PROBLEM DIRECTLY, AND ELIMINATION OF AUER-LIKE DEFERENCE WOULD CLEARLY BE PREFERABLE TO RETAINING THE DOCTRINE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. SHORT OF THAT, DEMANDING THAT THE STATUTORY BASIS FOR DEFERENCE IS CLEARLY ARTICULATED WOULD PROVIDE A MODEST FIRST STEP IN CABINING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSTITUTIONALLY QUESTIONABLE DELEGATIONS OF LAWMAKING AUTHORITY. THOSE WHO EMBRACE THE RULE OF LAW, WHETHER ADVOCATES OR OPPONENTS OF THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, SHOULD SUPPORT THAT STEP.
895	THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY AND THE SECURITY CULTURE OF THE STATE ARE ALWAYS SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS REFLECTING THE OUTCOME OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. KEY CATEGORIES OF SECURITY, LIKE DANGEROUS SOCIAL GROUPS AND ACTIVITIES ARE USUALLY NEGOTIATED THROUGH THESE INTERACTIONS. POLITICIANS, SECRET AGENTS, GENDARMS, DENUNCIATORS, JOURNALISTS, OR THE INDICTED, ALL SHAPE THE BROADER SOCIAL MEANING IN A DYNAMIC WAY. WHILE IN GREATER ROMANIA THE STATE ATTEMPTED TO EXTEND ITS CONTROL TO EVER BROADER SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY IN ORDER TO FEND OFF PERCEIVED THREATS IT HAD TO RELY ON ITS OWN PERSONNEL AND ON PEOPLE WHO COOPERATED IN THIS EFFORT, CREATING ROOM FOR MANEUVER FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. DUE TO ITS SCARCE RESOURCES THE STATE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL ENTIRELY ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES, WHO OFTEN PURSUED A PERSONAL AGENDA DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE'S OWN GOALS. IRREDENTISM, ASSOCIATED WITH ETHNIC MINORITIES EXEMPLIFIES THIS SITUATION QUITE WELL. IN AN EFFORT TO PREEMPT ANY THREAT FROM NATIONAL MINORITIES WITH A KIN-STATE GRADUALLY LED TO THE ASSOCIATION OF IRREDENTISM WITH ETHNICITY, WITHOUT HAVING CONTROL OVER THE LATTER'S EXACT MEANING. THUS, ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION DEPENDED ON A SERIES OF FACTORS, PERSONAL AND STRUCTURAL ONES, THAT FINALLY LED TO A CONFUSION AND TO THE EMPTYING OF THE CONCEPT THAT WAS APPLIED WITHOUT CONSISTENCY. IT WAS EXACTLY THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT RECONSTITUTED THE GAP BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY THAT ACTIVELY ENGAGED EACH OTHER IN THE RESULTING PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION. UNDER THE SURFACE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE IMAGE OF AN EVER MORE POWERFUL STATE SECURITY APPARATUS, STATE AND SOCIETY DEFINED TOGETHER THOSE INFORMAL RULES OF EVERYDAY CO-EXISTENCE THAT WERE OFTEN MEANT TO HIDE REALITY FROM THE WATCHFUL EYES OF BUCHAREST.
896	WE PROVIDE THE FIRST TEST OF AND FIND SUPPORT FOR THE HOFF AND STIGLITZ (2004A,B) MODEL PREDICTING UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS MASS PRIVATIZATIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY ASSET STRIPPING. WE ALSO TEST AND DO NOT FIND SUPPORT FOR THE MAIN PREDICTION OF THE CAMPOS AND GIOVANNONI (2006) MODEL. IN ADDITION TO TESTING THE THEORY, WE TACKLE AN IMPORTANT POLICY-ORIENTED ISSUE OF WHY A LARGE NUMBER OF EFFICIENT FIRMS DISAPPEARED DURING MASS PRIVATIZATION IN THE BOOMING ECONOMY OF MONTENEGRO. ECONOMETRICALLY, WE PRESENT THE FIRST STUDY TO LOOK AT FIRMS THAT DISAPPEARED DURING A MASS PRIVATIZATION TRANSITION, IMPROVING UPON PRIOR STUDIES THAT FOCUSED ONLY ON EXISTING FIRMS AND IGNORED SURVIVAL BIAS. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT ASSET STRIPPING AND FIRM DISAPPEARANCE WERE PRESENT, AND THAT ASSET STRIPPING WAS A LIKELY REASON FOR THE LOSS OF EFFICIENT FIRMS. WE SHOW THAT BECAUSE MORE PRODUCTIVE FIRMS WERE LIQUIDATED, IT IS IMPORTANT TO MODEL SURVIVAL BIAS IN THE SELECTION OF FIRMS REMAINING IN SAMPLES WHEN ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF PRIVATIZATION OR OTHER OWNERSHIP CHANGES. WE ALSO SHOW THAT ONE NEEDS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRUE START-UPS AND LIQUIDATED FIRMS THAT RE-APPEAR AS START-UPS. IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, MANY FIRMS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE DISAPPEARED WERE IN FACT APPROPRIATED BY MANAGERS AND POLITICALLY CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS.

897	A NUMBER OF STUDIES REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BY COMMENTATORS, BUT THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS AMONG THEM. FIRST OF ALL, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CLASSIFY THOSE RELATED PERSPECTIVES, AND THEN MAKES SOME COMMENTS. SECOND, BECAUSE GRASPING THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY IS BOTH COMPLEX AND COSTLY, THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO RETROSPECT THIS RELATION UNDER THE CONTEXT OF TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIZATION. THEN, IT WILL MAKE SOME PROSPECTIVE COMMENTS ON THIS RELATION UNDER THE SAME CONTEXT. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THREE DIMENSIONS ABOUT THIS RELATION WILL BE PRESENTED. FIRST, AT THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL, THE RELATION OF CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY DEVELOPS IN A NATURAL SPACE, FOR MAIN PARTIES IN TAIWAN DID NOT REPRESS CONFUCIANISM DURING THEIR RULING PERIOD. SECOND, OBSERVING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONFUCIANISM'S IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY, THERE EXIST POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INFLUENCES. ON THE CONTRARY, THIRD, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DEMOCRACY'S IMPACT ON CONFUCIANISM, TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIZATION CAUSES DIFFERENT IMPACT ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONFUCIANISM. BASED ON ABOVE-MENTIONED OBSERVATIONS, THIS PAPER FURTHER ANALYZES THE RELATION BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY IN A PROSPECTIVE WAY. IT CONCLUDES THAT CONFUCIANISM MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DEMOCRACY FROM FOUR ASPECTS, THAT IS, TO COMPLEMENT THE DEMERITS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BY ENFORCING THE MERITOCRACY; TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC SUPERVISION BY ENFORCING GENTLEMAN'S CONFUCIANISM; TO CULTIVATE THE SOCIAL CAPITAL IN A DEMOCRATIC REGIME BY COMMITTING TO THE SINCERITY AND TRUST; AND TO ACCOMMODATE DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM WITH CONFUCIAN CONCEPT OF SOCIAL HARMONY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, DEMOCRACY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CONFUCIANISM BY MODIFYING PARTICULAR ETHICS WITH UNIVERSAL ETHICS. IN SUM, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY WILL BE CHARACTERIZED AS A HYBRID STYLE IN WHICH CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY MAY COMPETE, COMPLEMENT, AND MODIFY WITH EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS HYBRID RELATION CAN BE USED TO OTHER CASE NEEDS TO BE FURTHER VERIFIED.
898	PROFESSOR STEPHEN YEAZELL ONCE WROTE, "A SOCIETY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW FAILS IN ONE OF ITS CENTRAL PREMISES IF SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THE POPULATION LACK ACCESS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONS.' ONE APPARENT THREAT TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE EROSION OF NOTICE PLEADING IN THE FEDERAL COURTS IN FAVOR OF A PLAUSIBILITY-PLEADING SYSTEM THAT SCREENS OUT POTENTIALLY MERITORIOUS CLAIMS THAT FAIL TO OFFER SUFFICIENT SPECIFICITY AND SUPPORT AT THE PLEADING STAGE. BUT SOME HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER THIS PURPORTED THREAT IS MORE PERCEIVED THAN REAL. INDEED, THIS DOCTRINAL SHIFT HAS BEEN DEFENDED IN SEVERAL WAYS THAT EACH SUGGEST-IN THEIR OWN WAY-THAT THE CRITICAL RESPONSE TO TWOMBLY AND IQBAL MAY BE MUCH ADO ABOUT LITTLE OR NOTHING. THESE APOLOGIES FOR THE DOCTRINAL SHIFT, IF YOU WILL, GENERALLY FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES. THE FIRST CONSISTS OF ARGUMENTS SUGGESTING THAT THE STANDARD HAS NOT REALLY CHANGED AT ALL, WHICH I WILL REFER TO AS THE "CONSISTENCY" DEFENSE. THE SECOND GROUP CONCEDES THAT THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE BUT ARGUES THAT THE CHANGE HAS NOT HAD OR WILL NOT HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT; I WILL CALL THIS THE "INCONSEQUENTIALITY" DEFENSE. THE FINAL CATEGORY CONTAINS THOSE ARGUMENTS ASSERTING THAT THE CHANGES ARE CONSEQUENTIAL BUT IN A GOOD WAY, MEANING THAT THE STRENGTHENING OF PLEADING STANDARDS WAS WARRANTED AND WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO THE LITIGATION SYSTEM. I REFER TO THIS TYPE OF ARGUMENT AS THE "EFFICIENCY" DEFENSE. THIS ESSAY RESPONDS TO EACH OF THESE APOLOGIES, FINDING THAT THE CONSISTENCY DEFENSE IS DOCTRINALLY UNSOUND, THAT THE INCONSEQUENTIALITY DEFENSE IS DOUBTFUL (IF NOT COUNTERFACTUAL), AND THAT THE EFFICIENCY DEFENSE IS MISGUIDED, GIVEN THE PATENT OVERINCLUSIVENESS AND SUBJECTIVITY OF THE PLAUSIBILITY DOCTRINE.
899	THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE THE GLOBAL SYSTEM'S OLDEST AND MOST VENERABLE TRIBUNAL HAS FAILED TO MEET ITS FULL POTENTIAL. THIS IS IN LARGE MEASURE DUE TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COURT MAY ONLY ASSERT JURISDICTION OVER STATES WITH THEIR CONSENT, WHICH IS OFTEN WITHHELD. TO HELP CORRECT FOR THIS FAILURE, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT THE COURT BE GIVEN A REFERRAL JURISDICTION. REFERRAL JURISDICTION WOULD EMPOWER THE COURT TO ISSUE ADVISORY OPINIONS ON INTERSTATE DISPUTES WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT OF STATE CONSENT. STANDING IN THE WAY OF NONCONSENT-BASED JURISDICTION, HOWEVER, IS THE PROBLEM OF THE GORDIAN KNOT: THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL COUNTRIES WHO ARE BEST ABLE TO LEAD OR BLOCK EXPANSION OF THE COURT'S JURISDICTION HAVE HISTORICALLY PERCEIVED THEIR ADVANTAGE TO LIE MORE WITH POLITICAL MUSCLE THAN EXPANDED JUDICIAL PROCESS. TODAY, THEIR POWER TO BLOCK IS MANIFEST IN THE ABILITY OF EACH OF THE PERMANENT FIVE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO VETO AMENDMENTS TO THE TREATY CREATING THE COURT. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THE GORDIAN KNOT PROBLEM. IT PROPOSES A LEGAL STRATEGY THAT WOULD ALLOW THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO ESTABLISH REFERRAL JURISDICTION WITHOUT A TREATY AMENDMENT. HAVING CUT THE GORDIAN KNOT, THIS ARTICLE GOES ON TO MAKE THE CASE FOR REFERRAL JURISDICTION. SPECIFICALLY, IT ARGUES THAT (1) THE PROPOSAL FOR REFERRAL JURISDICTION IS LEGAL UNDER THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THE STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, AND OTHER GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW; (2) REFERRAL JURISDICTION WOULD FURTHER COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW; AND (3) ITS IMPLEMENTATION WOULD INSTITUTIONALLY STRENGTHEN THE COURT. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING THAT THE RISE OF MANY NEWLY INDUSTRIALIZING COUNTRIES THAT MAY BE WILLING TO SPEARHEAD JURISDICTIONAL EXPANSION PORTENDS NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR CUTTING THE GORDIAN KNOT AND, IN THE PROCESS, UNLEASHING A PROMISING ERA OF GLOBAL RULE OF LAW REFORM.
900	SINCE THE 1980S, THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY'S (NCAFP) MIDDLE EAST PROJECT, UNDER THE DIRECTORSHIP OF THE LATE AMBASSADOR FEREYDOUN HOVEYDA, ADVANCED THE THESIS THAT NO GENUINE PEACE WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN THE ARAB MUSLIM WORLD AND THE WEST FOR AS LONG AS THE MIND-SET OF ARAB MUSLIMS REMAINED GLUED TO THE MIDDLE AGES. THE CONCLUSION DRAWN WAS THAT A REFORMATION OF THE MIND- SET MUST TAKE PLACE AND BE BROUGHT INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. BEARING THIS IN MIND, THE NCAFP CONVENED A SERIES OF CLOSED-DOOR AND NOT-FOR-ATTRIBUTION ROUNDTABLES ON WHAT AILS ARAB ISLAM. THE ROUNDTABLE CONVENED IN 2004 WAS TITLED "DEMOCRATIC REFORM AND THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN THE MUSLIM WORLD.'' CONCLUSIONS REACHED INCLUDED THE NEED TO BUILD CIVIL SOCIETY AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE ARAB MUSLIM WORLD WITH ALL THAT THAT IMPLIES, AMONG OTHER THINGS THE RULE OF LAW, FREE ELECTIONS, PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, AND EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN. REFORMS, IT WAS STRESSED, MUST NOT BE BROUGHT TO THE REGION BY BAYONETS BUT BY SOFT POWER. AID FROM THE WEST SHOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS IN GENERAL AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) SHOULD FOCUS ON ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. INSOFAR ASWOMEN ARE CONCERNED, THEREWAS AGREEMENT THAT THEY CAN AND MUST PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REOPENING "THE DOORS TO IJTIHAD (INDEPENDENT THINKING),'' "FIGHTING FOR 'ECONOMIC' EMPOWERMENT,'' AND WAGING "A MEDIA CAMPAIGN IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO 'ISLAMIST' PROPAGANDA AGAINST [WOMEN] RIGHTS AS WELL AS HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENERAL.'' THE RELEVANCE OF THE 2004 ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION TO THE OUTCOME OF THE SO-CALLED ARAB SPRING IS OBVIOUS. THIS IS A REPUBLICATION OF AN NCAFP MEETING REPORT. THE ORIGINAL MEETING WAS HELD ON MARCH 29, 2004.
901	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE RESIDENTS' TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS AND TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL EFFICACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE ON THAT TRUST AND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS IN AN EMERGING NATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH DATA WERE ANALYSED USING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGNS. FIRSTLY, A THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EXPLORE RESIDENTS' TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS AND COMPARE IT WITH THE DATA GATHERED IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW. THEREAFTER, A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES-STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) APPROACH WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE HYPOTHESISED LINKAGES. FINDINGS THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE FACE-TO-FACE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS DISCOVERED FOUR THEMES (TRUST, PERFORMANCE, POLITICAL EFFICACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE). ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THESE THEMES VIA THE PLS-SEM APPROACH REVEALED GOOD GOVERNANCE TO BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTOR IN PROMOTING RESIDENTS' TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS. POLITICAL EFFICACY WAS THE SECOND MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTOR. RESIDENTS EXPECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS' OFFICERS TO DEMONSTRATE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND COMPLY WITH ALL RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS SHOULD OPENLY ACCEPT RESIDENTS' REQUESTS AND SUGGESTIONS, BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN POLICY DELIVERY AND BE RESPONSIVE TO POLICY DEMANDS GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SMALL CONSTITUENCIES AND GREATER POLICY LATITUDES. MULTIPLE AVENUES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR INTERACTION BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS IN THE MISSION TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE URBAN GROWTH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT ADVANCES EXISTING RESEARCH THAT IS LACKING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MALAYSIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCIL. THE RESULT ALERTS ARE CRUCIAL IN THAT THEY ALERT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNCILS TO THE NEED FOR HIGH LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN TERMS OF RESIDENT SUPPORT TO GAIN MORE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE.
902	THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ENSHRINES ONE OF THE IMPORTANT POSTULATES ON THE FORMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY: A PERSON AND HIS RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE OF THE HIGHEST VALUE. IN THE MODERN PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, MANKIND ENTERED INTO ACTIVE COMMUNICATION RELATIONS THROUGH THE GLOBAL INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK INTERNET, WHICH IN TURN SHARPLY RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE NEED TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THE PROCESS OF INTERACTION THROUGH THE INTERNET, WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF GUARANTEES FOR THE REALIZATION OF SUCH RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AS REQUIRED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ALSO DID NOT STAND ASIDE FROM THE ABOVE PROCESSES AND WAS FORCED TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ITS CITIZENS ON THE INTERNET, WHICH, HOWEVER, OFTEN BOILED DOWN TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PROHIBITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON SUCH RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE AUTHORS OF THIS ARTICLE HAVE MADE AN ATTEMPT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, TO INDICATE THE MAIN DIRECTIONS FOR IMPROVING DOMESTIC FEDERAL LEGISLATION, IN ORDER TO REFLECT IN IT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NEED TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN THE FREE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK INTERNET. SO THAT THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, DUE TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION ON THE INTERNET, NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR THEIR PROTECTION IN THE NEW CONDITIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION, AND NOT A COMPLETE REJECTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF PROTECTING THEM.
903	THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMATIONS IN A CONTEXT OF GLOBALIZATION THROUGH THE NOTION OF THE "EMPLOYMENT GREY ZONE". THE NOTION OF THE EMPLOYMENT GREY ZONE (EGZ), ORIGINALLY COINED BY THE FRENCH LEGAL SCHOLAR A. SUPIOT TO CHARACTERIZE THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE "STATES OF SUBORDINATION" OF EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, IS REVISITED AND ANALYZED WITHIN THE BROADER FRAMEWORK OF AN "EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH A THIRD PARTY". THIS CASE IN POINT REFERS TO A CONTEXT OF PRODUCTION INTERNATIONALIZATION WHERE THE EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT JUST FACE-TO-FACE, BUT INCLUDES SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN STRUCTURING AND MANAGING THIS RELATIONSHIP. THE PROPOSED DEFINITION OF THE EGZ DOES NOT MERELY POINT TO AN INSTITUTIONAL FLAW IN THE RULE OF LAW, BUT CONSIDERS THAT ANY "GAP WITH THE NORM" HAS BECOME THE RULE AND NOT THE EXCEPTION. THE EGZ IS DEFINED HERE AS A "PUBLIC SPACE", UNDERSTOOD AS AN AREA OF DELIBERATION WHERE INTERESTS AND POWER RELATIONS ARE COORDINATED AND CONFRONTED: THE RESULT IS THE FORMATION OF A HYBRID ORDER OF REGULATION, ONE WHICH IS AT ONCE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, FORMAL AND INFORMAL. THE NOTION IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR PERCEIVING THE TRANSFORMATION OF EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH A NEW PRISM. THE EXAMPLE OF UBER SHOWS HOW THE ISSUE OF EMPLOYMENT RELATING TO ITS DRIVERS CANNOT BE EXCLUSIVELY REDUCED TO THE STANDARD JURIDICAL PARADIGM, WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE DEBATE TO DEFINING THEM AS EITHER EMPLOYEES OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE DIVERSITY AND, ALSO, THE FRAGILITY OF COURT RULINGS, THEIR PARTIAL AND REPEATEDLY PROVISIONAL CHARACTER, SUGGESTS THAT THE SOCIO-PROFESSIONAL SITUATION OF THE DRIVERS IS NOT ONLY "UNDECIDABLE" IN LEGAL TERMS. THE ACTION OF STATES AND OTHER TERRITORIAL GOVERNING BODIES, AS WELL AS THAT OF CIVIL SOCIETY, MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO COMPREHEND THE SYSTEM OF REGULATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP.
904	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF THE NEXT PHASE OF THE STUDY ON THE SUBJECT "SOCIO-CULTURAL PORTRAIT OF THE REGION". IT GIVES THE ESTIMATION OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION, STANDARD OF LIVING AND WELFARE OF THE VOLOGDA OBLAST RESIDENTS. BESIDES, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE PEOPLE'S ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AUTHORITIES, SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND DEGREE OF SAFETY, AS WELL AS THEIR TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT. ALL THESE ASPECTS ARE STUDIED IN THEIR CONNECTION WITH SOCIAL POLICY AND SOCIAL PROTECTION MEASURES UNDERTAKEN IN THE REGION. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THE SOCIETY IS DISAPPOINTED IN THE ACTIONS OF THE AUTHORITIES; IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE ULTIMATE EFFECT AND THE FEASIBILITY OF ONGOING REGIONAL SOCIAL EVENTS. THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CRITICAL REMARKS ADDRESSED TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES COMES FROM PEOPLE WITH UNSTABLE POSITION IN LIFE. NEGATIVE EVALUATIONS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY EXPRESSED BY THE POOREST POPULATION GROUPS, BY WOMEN, BY THE LESS EDUCATED, BY VILLAGE DWELLERS AND URBAN-TYPE SETTLEMENTS RESIDENTS, AS WELL AS BY INDIVIDUALS WITH A LOW LEVEL OF EDUCATION. SOCIAL POLICY IN THE MINDS OF A LARGE PART OF THE POPULATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, EQUALITY, RULE OF LAW, RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIALLY IMPORTANT VALUES. THE VOLOGDA OBLAST RESIDENTS DO NOT FEEL THAT THEIR SPIRITUAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS ARE BEING ENDANGERED; AND THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ENSURING THE SECURITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH, DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING, LEGITIMATE AND FAIR PERFORMANCE OF THE BASIC SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN UNSETTLED, ACCORDING TO THEIR UNDERSTANDING. AT THE SAME TIME, SOCIAL POLICY SHOULD CREATE CONDITIONS TO STABILIZE SOCIAL RELATIONS, TO ENSURE EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY, WHICH SHOULD ADEQUATELY RESPOND TO ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS.
905	IN RECENT YEARS, THE SUPREME COURT HAS INCREASINGLY SUPPLEMENTED TRADITIONAL MARBURY-STYLE JUDICIAL REVIEW WITH CONSTITUTIONALLY INSPIRED CLEAR STATEMENT RULES. THESE CANONS OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION HAVE TWO SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS. FIRST, THEY IMPOSE A CLARITY TAX ON CONGRESS BY INSISTING THAT CONGRESS LEGISLATE EXCEPTIONALLY CLEARLY WHEN IT WISHES TO ACHIEVE A STATUTORY OUTCOME THAT THREATENS TO INTRUDE UPON SOME JUDICIALLY IDENTIFIED CONSTITUTIONAL VALUE SUCH AS FEDERALISM, NONRETROACTIVITY, OR THE RULE OF LAW. SECOND, AS THE COURT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED, CLEAR STATEMENT RULES APPLY EVEN THOUGH THE OUTCOMES AVOIDED BY SUCH RULES WOULD NOT THEMSELVES VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. FOR EXAMPLE, ALTHOUGH THE COURT HAS HELD THAT THE EX POST FACTO CLAUSE PROHIBITS RETROACTIVITY ONLY IN THE CRIMINAL CONTEXT, THE COURT HAS ALSO CULLED FROM THAT CLAUSE (AMONG OTHERS) A MORE GENERAL VALUE THAT IT USES TO JUSTIFY A NONRETROACTIVITY CLEAR STATEMENT RULE FOR CIVIL CASES. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT SUCH CLEAR STATEMENT RULES REST ON THE MISTAKEN PREMISE THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONTAINS FREESTANDING VALUES THAT CAN BE MEANINGFULLY IDENTIFIED AND ENFORCED APART FROM THE SPECIFIC TERMS OF THE CLAUSES FROM WHICH THE COURT DERIVES THEM. IN FACT, THE CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS A "BUNDLE OF COMPROMISES" THAT EMBODY NOT MERELY ABSTRACT ENDS OR VALUES, BUT ALSO PARTICULAR MEANS THAT LIMIT AND DEFINE THE SCOPE AND THE CONTENT OF THOSE VALUES. IF THE EX POST FACTO CLAUSE PROHIBITS RETROACTIVITY IN THE CRIMINAL CONTEXT, IT VIOLATES THE TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTING BARGAIN TO EXTEND ITS ANIMATING VALUE TO CIVIL CONTEXTS. THIS CONCERN THAT CLEAR STATEMENT RULES IMPERMISSIBLY ABSTRACT FROM CONCRETE CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS TO GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL ENDS APPLIES, MOREOVER, EVEN IF ONE BELIEVES THAT MOST CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IS NOW PROPERLY FOUND IN JUDGE-MADE IMPLEMENTING DOCTRINE. SUCH DOCTRINE ITSELF OFTEN DEFINES RELATIVELY PRECISE MEANS OF ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION, NOT MERELY THE VAGUE CONSTITUTIONAL ENDS THAT SO OFTEN ANIMATE CLEAR STATEMENT RULES.
906	THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) RECENTLY CELEBRATED THE 10TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF ITS FOUNDING TREATY, THE ROME STATUTE. THE COURT IS UP AND RUNNING, YET SOME ASPECTS OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW, WHICH COULD NOT BE AGREED UPON IN ROME OR THEREAFTER, CONTINUE TO PRE-OCCUPY MANY MINDS. THIS ARTICLE CONCERNS THE PRE-CONDITIONS TO THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION OF THE ICC WITH REGARD TO THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION. AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE ICC HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION, YET IT CANNOT EXERCISE SAID JURISDICTION UNTIL THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION HAS BEEN DEFINED AND THE CONDITIONS FOR THE COURT TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO SAID CRIME HAVE BEEN SET. IT IS THIS LATTER PART THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED THOROUGHLY IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE. THIS ASPECT OF THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION IS HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS BECAUSE IT ENCOMPASSES BOTH ASPECTS OF POWER POLITICS INVOLVING THE USE OF FORCE AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THE RULE OF LAW EMBODIED IN THE ICC. IT IS AT THE CROSSROADS OF JUS AD BELLUM AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, TOUCHING ON BOTH AND IN NEED OF FITTING INTO BOTH LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS THE COMPETENCE TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ACT OF AGGRESSION, THE ICC HAS THE COMPETENCE TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A CRIME OF AGGRESSION, AND THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THAT A CRIME OF AGGRESSION MUST INCLUDE AN ACT OF AGGRESSION. THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN IN ORDER TO FURTHER STIMULATE INFORMED DISCUSSION AMONG A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION. AT THE SAME TIME, IT AIMS TO PROVIDE A COMPROMISE SOLUTION AND EXPLAINS WHY IT IS ESSENTIAL TO FIND A CONCRETE AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD FIND OVERALL SUPPORT AT THE UPCOMING REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE ICC.
907	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A STARTLING AND PREVIOUSLY UNNOTICED LINE OF CASES IN WHICH STATE COURTS IN THE JIM CROW ERA RULED AGAINST WHITE PLAINTIFFS TRYING TO USE COMMON LAW NUISANCE DOCTRINE TO ACHIEVE RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. THESE "RACE-NUISANCE" CASES COMPLICATE THE VIEW OF MOST LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT STATE COURTS DURING THE JIM CROW ERA OPENLY ESCHEWED THE RULE OF LAW IN SERVICE OF WHITE SUPREMACY. INSTEAD, THE CASES PROVIDE RICH SOCIAL HISTORICAL DETAIL SHOWING SOUTHERN JUDGES WRESTLING WITH THEIR COMPETING ALLEGIANCES TO BOTH PRECEDENT AND THE PURSUIT OF RACIAL EXCLUSIVITY. SURPRISINGLY, THE ALLEGIANCE TO PRECEDENT GENERALLY PREVAILED. THE CASES CONFOUND PREVAILING LEGAL THEORIES, PARTICULARLY NEW FORMALISM AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY'S INTEREST CONVERGENCE. WHILE NEW FORMALISTS MAY AT FIRST SEE THESE CASES AS SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR CLAIMS, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE LIMITATIONS OF FORMALISM'S REACH BY ALSO EXPLORING THE RELATED LINE OF RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANT CASES. SIMILARLY, WHILE INTEREST CONVERGENCE SCHOLARS MIGHT ATTEMPT TO READ MANY OF THE CASES AS SUPPORTING WHITE PROPERTY OWNERS' INTERESTS, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE RACE-NUISANCE CASES ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS DEMONSTRATING THAT WHITE INTERESTS ARE MULTI-FACETED. INTEREST CONVERGENCE IS THEREFORE A USEFUL WAY TO EXPLAIN UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES BUT NOT TO PREDICT SUCH OUTCOMES. ANOTHER LINE OF INQUIRY RAISED BY THE CASES IS WHETHER COURTS RACIALIZED NUISANCE DOCTRINE BY MARKING AS NUISANCE CONDUCT ASSOCIATED WITH BLACKS AND REWARDING BLACKS WHO ADHERED TO WHITE NORMS. THE FIRST CLAIM IS IMPOSSIBLE TO VERIFY WITH ANY CERTAINTY-AND THE SECOND EMBRACES GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS OF RACIAL GROUP BEHAVIORS. IN SUM, THE ARTICLE CASTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ON THE BACKGROUND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE WAY LAW WORKED DURING THE JIM CROW ERA, AND THUS PROVIDES A MORE TEXTURED UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PERIOD.
908	LIKE COURTS EVERYWHERE ELSE, SOCIALIST COURTS ARE TASKED WITH SETTLING DISPUTES. THEIR DECISIONS ARE BACKED BY THE FORCE OF LAW. BUT UNLIKE COURTS EVERYWHERE ELSE, SOCIALIST COURTS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO SUPPORT OFFICIAL IDEOLOGY AND POLICIES. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE SUPERVISION AND PARTY LEADERSHIP IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES. THE REPUDIATION OF THE NOTION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE INSTRUMENTAL CONCEPTION OF LAW ARE CONVENTIONALLY TAKEN TO BE DEFINING-AND DEFECTIVE-ASPECTS OF SOCIALIST LEGALITY. BUT THE POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOCIALIST COURTS COULD ALSO BE EMPOWERING. BECAUSE SOCIALIST COURTS ANSWER, IN THEORY, TO THE PARTY AND THE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE THE WARRANT AND DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF SOCIETY. CONSTITUTIONAL SCRIPTURE DOES NOT PROHIBIT SOCIALIST COURTS FROM VENTURING BEYOND THE CONFINES OF ADJUDICATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES NOT PRESENTED FOR RESOLUTION. WE STUDY HOW COURTS IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOCIALIST REGIME INTERVENE IN POLICY DOMAINS RANGING FROM PUBLIC HEALTH TO EDUCATION TO CRIME BY MAKING JUDICIAL SUGGESTIONS. THESE SUGGESTIONS IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT GO BEYOND THE LEGAL QUESTIONS RAISED BY A CASE AND MAY BE DIRECTED TO PRIVATE ACTORS LIKE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES AND PUBLIC ENTITIES LIKE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. THOUGH NOT BINDING ON THEIR RECIPIENTS, JUDICIAL SUGGESTIONS ARE OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED, SOMETIMES ADOPTED, AND HAVE OCCASIONALLY EVEN PRECIPITATED LEGAL REFORM. OUR EXPLORATION OF JUDICIAL SUGGESTIONS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ILLUMINATES A FUNCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO SOCIALIST COURTS BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL SUBORDINATION TO THE PARTY-STATE. MORE BROADLY, THE APPROACH EXEMPLIFIED HERE STEPS OUTSIDE THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE PARADIGMS TO EXAMINE HOW CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE SHAPES THE BOUNDARIES OF INSTITUTIONS, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIALIST COURTS AND THE ROLES THAT COURTS MIGHT USEFULLY TAKE ON IN A WORLD WITHOUT SEPARATION OF POWERS.
909	"THE MARKET FOR IDEAS" IS PLACED BY SCHOLARS AND COMMONERS BETWEEN LITERARY METAPHORS AND CATCHY PARAPHRASES. HOWEVER, ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE, IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENCES OF COGNITION AND COMMUNICATION, HAVE AT LEAST SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE CONCEPT. THE MARKETPLACES OF IDEAS ENTAIL A MIXTURE OF "CATHEDRAE" (GOVERNED BY THE RIGORS OF EPISTEMOLOGICAL ADEQUACY IN FINDING SCIENTIFIC TRUTH), "BAZAARS" (GOVERNED BY PROFIT-SEEKING IN THE CONFINES OF THE LAW OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY), AND "AGORAE" (GOVERNED BY THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW OR BY THE DESPOTIC RULE OF MEN). IDEAS USUALLY BECOME SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ONLY AFTER PASSING THE TEST OF REASON, WHICH NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY PROPERLY SELECTED METHODOLOGICAL TOOLKITS. FAR FROM BEING SCARCITY-PROOF OBJECTS, IDEAS ARE (SERVICEABLE) PRODUCTS (CALCULATEDLY) PRODUCED BY (RESOURCEFUL) PRODUCERS, SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC SCRUTINY. ALSO, IDEAS ARE THE OFFSHOOTS OF THE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT OVERRATED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (TEMPERED IN THE POLITICAL ARENA BY THE POWER OF EITHER BLUNT MAJORITIES OR ACTIVE MINORITIES). THUS, IT IS LEGITIMATE TO CONTINUOUSLY QUESTION WHICH ARE AND OUGHT TO BE THE MECHANISMS FOR SECURING THE QUEST FOR TRUTH, SINCE ONLY TRUE IDEAS ARE ULTIMATELY PRONE TO SUSTAINABLE PROSPERITY AND PEACEFULNESS, THOUGH SHORT-SIGHTED PROFITEERING AND FORCED (OR ACCOMPLICE) OBEDIENCE MIGHT SUGGEST OTHERWISE. SCIENTIFIC TRUTH (I.E., IN SOCIAL SCIENCES) IS CAUGHT AMONGST EPISTEMIC, AS WELL AS (PSEUDO-)ECONOMIC AND (POOR) POLITICAL FILTERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY AND INVESTIGATE THE FRAMEWORKS FOR THE EVALUATION AND EXPLANATION OF THE MARKETS FOR IDEAS, AT THE CROSSROADS OF THE "TRUE-FALSE", "PROFITABLE-UNPROFITABLE" AND "APPROVED -DENIED" MINGLED FILTERS. THE APPROACH IS EQUALLY CONCEPTUAL (THEORETICAL) AND CONTEXTUAL (HISTORICAL), AND WHILST BEING INEVITABLY INTERDISCIPLINARY, IT ULTIMATELY RELIES ON ECONOMIC SCIENCE, SERVING A DUAL ROLE: AS SCIENTIFIC DECODER AS WELL AS DECODABLE CASE STUDY.
910	THE PATHOLOGIST WALTHER BERBLINGER (1882-1966) BECAME FAMOUS FOR HIS SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON INTERNAL SECRETION, NAMELY ON THE PATHOLOGY OF THE PITUITARY AND THE PINEAL GLAND. THE RESULTS OF HIS RESEARCH ON THE HORMONAL CONTROL OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE YOUNG DISCIPLINE OF ENDOCRINOLOGY. HIS LATER PIONEERING WORK ON THE USE OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS IN TUBERCULOSIS WAS SIMILARLY IMPORTANT. DESPITE HIS "ARYAN" ANCESTRY, BERBLINGER WAS TARGETED BY THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS AND FORCED TO EMIGRATE TO SWITZERLAND DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF POLITICAL EVENTS - A FACT THAT HAS ONLY BEEN PARTIALLY INVESTIGATED BY RESEARCHERS TO DATE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS ESSAY FOCUSES ON BERBLINGER'S PROFESSIONAL EXCLUSION AND ON THE IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IT ALSO EXAMINES WHY BERBLINGER DECIDED NOT TO RETURN TO GERMANY AFTER 1945. PRIMARY DOCUMENTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES JENA AND THE MAIN STATE ARCHIVES WEIMAR SERVED AS THE CENTRAL SOURCE FOR THIS STUDY; THEY WERE SUPPLEMENTED AND COMPARED WITH THE RESEARCH LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO DATE ON WALTHER BERBLINGER AND ON THE HISTORY OF PATHOLOGY AND MEDICINE UNDER NATIONAL SOCIALISM. THE STUDY DOCUMENTS THAT BERBLINGER - UNLIKE HIS JEWISH COLLEAGUES - WAS INITIALLY ABLE TO CONTINUE HIS CAREER IN THE THIRD REICH ALMOST WITHOUT RESTRICTION, BUT WAS DISMISSED FROM SERVICE WHEN HE REFUSED TO SEPARATE FROM HIS JEWISH WIFE IN 1937. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS' VICTIMIZATION OF BERLINGER EVEN REACHED HIM IN SWISS EXILE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE HOSTILE TREATMENT AND HARASSMENT FROM GERMANY, BERBLINGER SUCCEEDED IN CONTINUING HIS SCIENTIFIC CAREER IN SWITZERLAND. AFTER 1945, HE DECIDED AGAINST REMIGRATION - NOT LEAST BECAUSE NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH GERMAN AUTHORITIES MADE LED HIM DOUBT THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-WAR GERMANY. IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE LAST PHASE OF HIS LIFE THAT BERBLINGER WAS "REDISCOVERED BY HIS HOMELAND, AS IS SHOWN BY A SERIES OF LATE HONORS.
911	THE UK'S 2016 DECISION TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE DISCUSSION SURROUNDING IT INDICATE THAT PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF BRITISH IDENTITY HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. DEFINING BRITISH IDENTITY WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TASK IN THE YEARS TO COME. THE UK GOVERNMENT NOT LONG AGO PROVIDED SOME GUIDANCE ON THE MATTER OF BRITISH IDENTITY IN THEIR REQUIREMENT THAT SCHOOLS ACTIVELY PROMOTE FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND RESPECT OF THOSE WITH DIFFERENT FAITHS AND BELIEFS. THESE VALUES ARE NOT BRITISH IN THE PAROCHIAL SENSE: THEY ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, CONCILIATORY, COSMOPOLITAN VALUES. THEY ARE MEANT TO STRUCTURE AND GUIDE ANY COMMITMENTS TO MORE PARTICULAR FEATURES OF WHAT BRITISH IDENTITY MIGHT INCLUDE. BECAUSE THEY ARE RATIONAL AND SOMEWHAT ABSTRACT, IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE HOW THEY MIGHT BE CULTIVATED IN CHILDREN (WHO ARE NOT FULLY RATIONAL) OR HOW THEY MIGHT FIT TOGETHER WITH THE NON-RATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE HUMAN PERSON. KANT'S ACCOUNT OF EDUCATION IS SEEN TO FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND IS SEEN BY SOME AS UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEALING WITH THEM. I ARGUE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND THAT HIS IDEA OF EDUCATION CONTAINS A VIABLE AND PHILOSOPHICALLY INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF HOW VALUES LIKE THESE MAY BE INTEGRATED INTO A THEORY OF EDUCATION THAT TAKES SERIOUSLY THE WHOLE PERSON, RATIONAL AND NON-RATIONAL ASPECTS ALIKE. I BEGIN BY OUTLINING KANT'S CONCEPTION OF RATIONAL ACTION BEFORE EXAMINING THREE FURTHER FEATURES IN HIS ACCOUNT: HABIT, SHAME, AND DESIRE (INCLUDING PLEASURE). I CONCLUDE BY LOOKING BRIEFLY AT SOME OF KANT'S WORK THAT REVEALS HOW EDUCATION IS ORIENTED TOWARD THE FORMATION OF A COSMOPOLITAN SOCIETY WITH CITIZENS WHOSE DUTIES AND SYMPATHIES EXTEND BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE HORIZON OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY. I ARGUE THAT KANTIAN ETHICS THEREFORE PROVIDES A HELPFUL PHILOSOPHICAL ROADMAP, AS IT WERE, FOR THE SUCCESSFUL CULTIVATION OF COSMOPOLITAN, BRITISH VALUES.
912	BACKGROUND: FORENSIC AGE ESTIMATION IS REQUESTED BY COURTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES SO THAT IMMIGRANTS WHOSE REAL AGE IS UNKNOWN SHOULD NOT SUFFER UNFAIR DISADVANTAGES BECAUSE OF THEIR SUPPOSED AGE, AND SO THAT ALL LEGAL PROCEDURES TO WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL'S AGE IS RELEVANT CAN BE PROPERLY FOLLOWED. 157 AGE ESTIMATIONS WERE REQUESTED IN BERLIN IN 2014, MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY AS IN 2004. METHODS: THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON PERTINENT ARTICLES RETRIEVED BY A SELECTIVE SEARCH IN THE PUBMED AND MEDPILOT DATABASES, SUPPLEMENTED BY RELEVANT RECOMMENDATIONS AND BY THE FINDINGS OF THE AUTHORS' OWN RESEARCH. RESULTS: THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AGE ESTIMATION ARE THE HISTORY, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, X-RAYS OF THE HANDS, PANORAMA FILMS OF THE JAWS, AND, IF INDICATED, A THIN-SLICE CT OF THE MEDIAL CLAVICULAR EPIPHYSES, PROVIDED THAT THERE IS A LEGAL BASIS FOR X-RAY EXAMINATIONS WITHOUT A MEDICAL INDICATION. MULTIPLE METHODS ARE ALWAYS USED IN COMBINATION, FOR OPTIMAL ACCURACY. DEPENDING ON THE LEGAL ISSUES AT HAND, THE EXAMINER MAY BE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE INDIVIDUAL'S MINIMUM AGE AND/OR HIS OR HER MOST PROBABLE AGE. THE MINIMUM-AGE CONCEPT CAN BE USED IN DETERMINATIONS WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL HAS REACHED THE AGE OF LEGAL MAJORITY. IT IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT PRACTICALLY ALL PERSONS CLASSIFIED AS ADULTS HAVE, IN FACT, ATTAINED LEGAL MAJORITY, EVEN THOUGH SOME OTHER PERSONS WILL BE INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED AS MINORS. CONCLUSION: FORENSIC AGE ESTIMATION LETS COURTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES DETERMINE THE OFFICIAL AGE OF PERSONS WHOSE ACTUAL AGE IS UNKNOWN-IN MOST CASES, UNACCOMPANIED REFUGEES WHO MAY BE MINORS. THE GOAL IS TO CARRY OUT AGE-DEPENDENT LEGAL PROCEDURES APPROPRIATELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE MINIMUM-AGE CONCEPT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE ERRONEOUS CLASSIFICATION OF MINORS AS LEGAL ADULTS.
913	AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ULRICH BECK PLACED TERRORISM ALONGSIDE OTHER POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS GLOBAL WARMING, NUCLEAR DISASTER, AND INFLUENZA AS ONE OF THE 'DIMENSIONS' OF RISK SOCIETY. IN RISK SOCIETY, EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENTS TAKE 'PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES' AND PARLIAMENTS PASS 'PREVENTATIVE LAWS' ALLOWING THEM TO ACCUMULATE INFORMATION, DETAIN TERRORISM SUSPECTS, FREEZE FUNDS AND PROHIBIT VARIOUS GROUPS, IN ORDER TO STOP CATASTROPHIC RISKS FROM EVENTUATING. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE USED RISK SOCIETY THEORY OR THE IDEAS OF MICHEL FOUCAULT TO CRITICISE SUCH EXCESSES OF THE EXECUTIVE AND PARLIAMENTARY BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. MOST STUDIES EITHER IGNORE THE JUDICIARY OR ARGUE THAT IT STANDS IN OPPOSITION TO THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENTS, THAT IT IMPOSES CHECKS AND BALANCES IN ORDER TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS VIEW IS NAIVE AND DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A LONG HISTORY OF JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO THE WILL OF THE EXECUTIVE AND PARLIAMENT. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF CASE LAW FROM AUSTRALIA AND CANADA THE ARTICLE EXPLORES PARALLELS BETWEEN EARLY 21ST CENTURY JUDICIAL REASONING AND PREVIOUS PERIODS OF CRISIS, INCLUDING THE COLD WAR, WHILE IDENTIFYING SOME NEW 'PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH' ASPECTS. THE JUDICIARY DEFERS TO THE EXECUTIVE, ASSERTS THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS MORE ACCOUNTABLE THAN IT, AND SEEKS TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENGAGING IN THIS 'PRECAUTIONARY JUSTICE'. FURTHERMORE, SEIZED BY THE SAME FEAR OF TERRORISM AS EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENTS, THE JUDICIARY SHOWS AN ABILITY TO ADAPT EXISTING LEGAL CONCEPTS TO THE EXIGENCIES OF RISK SOCIETY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT AS THE MEMORY OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS FADES SOME OF THE MOST DRACONIAN PREVENTATIVE MEASURES MAY BE SCALED BACK BUT THE JUDICIARY CANNOT BE RELIED ON TO KEEP THE EXECUTIVE OR PARLIAMENT IN CHECK.
914	THE DECISION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA CONCERNS THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE CONVENTION ON PREVENTING AND COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, DRAWN UP ON 11 MAY 2011 IN ISTANBUL (HEREINAFTER: THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION; THE CONVENTION) WITH THE CONSTITUTION. THE DECISION WAS ISSUED ON 27 JULY 2018. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED THAT THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION, DUE TO THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 3(C) AND ARTICLE 4 3, WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ITS INTERPRETATION, IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CONVENTION DOES NOT ALLOW FOR RESERVATIONS TO BE MADE TO THESE PROVISIONS. THE REASON FOR FINDING THESE PROVISIONS INCONSISTENT WITH THE BULGARIAN CONSTITUTION WAS THAT THE CONVENTION RECOGNIZED GENDER AS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT, BREAKING DOWN THE UNITY OF THE SOCIO-CULTURAL DIMENSION AND THE BIOLOGICALLY DETERMINED GENDER. BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE CONVENTION AS AUTONOMOUS, EQUAL. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT INDICATED THAT AT THE AXIOLOGICAL LEVEL, THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION INCLUDES ASPECTS OF GENDER IDEOLOGY, WHICH IT DEFINED AS: "ALL IDEAS, BELIEFS AND CONVICTIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH BIOLOGICALLY DETERMINED SEXUAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE IRRELEVANT, AND ONLY GENDER SELF-IDENTIFICATION IS IMPORTANT". THE DECISION ALSO INDICATED THAT THE TERMS "GENDER" AND "GENDER IDENTITY" USED IN THE CONVENTION DO NOT HAVE AN UNAMBIGUOUS CONTENT, WHICH VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE PARTY TO THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION IS OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE. THE RULING ISSUED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ENDED THE ONGOING POLITICAL DISPUTE IN BULGARIA REGARDING THE RATIFICATION OF THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION. THE FINDINGS MADE BY THE BULGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MAY ALSO BE IMPORTANT IN THE ONGOING DISCUSSION IN POLAND, THE SUBJECT OF WHICH IS THE TERMINATION OF THIS INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.
915	ON 16 SEPTEMBER 2019, THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 73/343 ON TACKLING ILLICIT TRAFFICKING IN WILDLIFE REITERATED THE CONCEPT WHEREBY WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING CONSTITUTES A SERIOUS THREAT NOT ONLY TO THE WORLD'S BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEMS BUT ALSO TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND TO THE RULE OF LAW. BECAUSE OF THE TRANSNATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE ILLICIT TRADE IN PROTECTED SPECIES AND BECAUSE THIS ACTIVITY IS OFTEN CARRIED OUT BY ORGANISED CRIMINAL GROUPS, ANY STRATEGY OF PREVENTION AND REPRESSION OF WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING SHOULD ENTAIL AN EFFECTIVE COOPERATION BETWEEN STATES WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE WAYS IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS DEALT WITH WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING SO FAR, AND ON THE POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT INTERNATIONAL LAW SOURCES TO PROVIDE STATES WITH EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO MANAGE THE RISKS POSED BY THIS TRANSNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME. TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON TWO MAIN FIELDS OF ENQUIRY. FIRST, IT CONSIDERS THE CHARACTERISATION OF WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AS A THREAT TO THE PEACE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF CHAPTER VII OF THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS BY THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL IN RESOLUTIONS 2134 (2014) AND 2136 (2014), REFLECTING ON THE POSSIBILITY TO EXPAND SUCH A QUALIFICATION OUTWITH THE CONTEXT OF SPECIFIC INTERNAL CONFLICTS AND THE ACTIVITIES OF ARMED GROUPS. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH AN APPROACH AND ITS EVENTUAL ADDED VALUE IN THE LIGHT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK ALREADY APPLICABLE TO WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING. TO DO SO, IT ENQUIRES ON WHETHER THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME, IN SYNERGY WITH THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF WILD FAUNA AND FLORA, CAN PROVIDE STATES PARTIES WITH AN APPROPRIATE AND SUFFICIENT FRAMEWORK TO TACKLE THE GLOBAL THREATS POSED BY WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING.
916	THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) NECESSITATES QUALITY GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION AND ALSO THE GENUINE ENGAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS (E.G., NGOS, CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS) AND BUSINESSES ALIKE. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, GOAL 7 (ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL) IN PARTICULAR, ARE UNREALISTIC WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS OF HAITI. TO THIS END, WE EXPLORE THE TRENDS IN WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX, SOCIOECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDEX OF HAITI USING DATASETS SPANNING FROM 2002 TO 2017. WE ALSO EXPLORE THE TRENDS IN ENERGY USE, ELECTRIC POWER CONSUMPTION, AND FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF HAITI USING DATASETS FROM 1994 TO 2014. THE RESULTS SHOW DISAPPOINTING TRENDS IN ALL THESE INDICATORS, INDICATING THE PERSISTENCE OF ILL-GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION AS WELL AS SEVERE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. PARTICULARLY, THE NEGATIVE TRENDS IN THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT HAITI'S INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS ARE TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SDGS, DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN OUR CASE. MOREOVER, THE ABSENCE OF THE POLITICAL WILL TO CURTAIL CORRUPTION AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE ELITES OF HAITI TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO OF THE CHAOTIC SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THEIR WEALTH HAS BEEN BUILT MAKE THE SDGS EVEN MORE UNREALISTIC. WE ADVOCATE FOR CONSCIOUS EFFORTS AND SACRIFICES BY THE ELITES TO GET HAITI OUT OF ITS CURRENT CHAOTIC SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS. THEREBY, WE OUTLINE THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND MARKET REFORM AND ALSO THE GENUINE ENGAGEMENT OF THE ELITES AND INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DISCOURSE.

917	ROBERT FINE WAS AMONG THE MOST ORIGINAL SOCIAL THEORISTS IN BRITAIN OF THE PAST 30 YEARS, AND THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO OFFER A FIRST SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF HIS INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTION. THERE ARE SOUND INTELLECTUAL REASONS TO EXPLORE FINE'S SCHOLARSHIP. HE MAINTAINED A PROBLEMATIC RELATION WITH MAINSTREAM SOCIOLOGY AND, AGAINST THE REDUCTION OF SOCIOLOGY TO QUESTIONS OF METHOD, CULTURE, OR CLASS, HE ARGUED THAT SOCIOLOGISTS MUST CONTINUE TO ASK DIFFICULT NORMATIVE QUESTIONS AS PART OF THE SOCIAL WORLD THEY OUGHT TO EXPLAIN. AND THERE ARE ALSO PRESSING POLITICAL CONCERNS THAT JUSTIFY A RECONSIDERATION OF HIS WRITINGS. GLOBAL POLITICS IS CURRENTLY MARKED BY A POPULIST WAVE THAT DECRIES THE VERY IDEAS AND VALUES THAT WERE CENTRAL TO FINE'S SOCIAL THEORY: THE NEED TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AT HOME AND ABROAD, THE POLITICS OF COSMOPOLITAN SOLIDARITY, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTISEMITISM AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH DIFFERENT FORMS OF AUTHORITARIAN POLITICS. MY MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE IS A DIALECTICS OF UNIVERSALITY THAT DRIVES FORWARD FINE'S INTELLECTUAL PROJECT. BY THIS, I MEAN THAT A UNIVERSALISTIC IDEA OF HUMANITY-AN ALL-INCLUSIVE CONCEPTION OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS-IS THE MOST IMPORTANT NORMATIVE INTUITION OF MODERN TIMES. THIS IDEA OF HUMANITY MOVES FORWARD IN HISTORY THROUGH A DUAL PROCESS OF EMANCIPATION AND DOMINATION: SUCCESSFUL FORMS OF SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND POLITICAL INCLUSION HELP MAKE VISIBLE PREVIOUS DYNAMICS OF EXCLUSION BUT MAY ALSO CREATE OR RECREATE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. BUILDING ON THE WORK OF FRENCH HISTORIAN MICHAEL LOWY ON HETERODOX JEWISH THINKERS, I EXPLAIN THE THREE MAIN TENETS OF FINE'S WORK: (A) HIS RECONSTRUCTION OF CRITICAL SOCIAL THEORY; (B) THE NOTION OF COSMOPOLITAN SOLIDARITY; AND (C) THE SIGNIFICANCE AND MAIN FEATURES OF MODERN ANTISEMITISM.
918	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE APPLICATION OF ELECTRONIC FORMS IN RUSSIAN AND GERMAN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT STATE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE LEGISLATION IN THE VIEW OF DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION USAGE CONSIDERING THREE FORMS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS: THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, PROCEEDINGS ON ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE USE OF COMPARATIVE LEGAL RESEARCH THAT ALLOWED US TO SEE THE GENERAL TENDENCIES OF DIGITALISATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE WITHIN TWO LEGAL SYSTEMS AND TO OBTAIN A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OFT HE APPLICATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN RUSSIAN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE. THE STUDY DISCOVERED AN INEQUALITY OF DIGITALISATION PROCESSES IN VARIOUS TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS AS WELL AS WITHIN EACH OF THEM. IN PARTICULAR, DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION IS WIDELY USED IN ADMINISTRATIVE TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, WHEREAS PROCEEDINGS ON ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES USE THEM THE LEAST. THE DIGITIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IS PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED TO EVALUATE IN GENERAL DUE ITS EXTRAORDINARY DIVERSITY AND THE ABSENCE OF CODIFICATION FOR LEGISLATION REGARDING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. HENCE, PROVISIONS FOR STATE AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES PROVIDED WERE SUBJECT TO DIGITALISATION MOST EFFECTIVELY WHILE OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES (CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES, LICENSING ETC.) ARE STILL AWAITING THEIR TURN. THE ANALYSIS OF APPLICATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ILLUSTRATES A SHIFT IN LAW-ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY: THE AUTOMATIZATION OF POWER DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES REPLACES HUMANS EXERCISING AN EXPRESSION OF WILL BY MACHINERY (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE) AND RESULTS IN A COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TECHNOLOGIZATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, THE SOCIAL NATURE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION INEVITABLY ENTAILS THE QUESTION OF LIMITS FOR THE COMPLETE DIGITALISATION OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN RELATION TO THOSE TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE WHICH CONCERN HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS.
919	ONCE A STATE BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY (IN LINE WITH KANT'S REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION) IS ESTABLISHED, IT FACES THE CHALLENGE OF SELF-PRESERVATION. ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE KANT ARGUED AGAINST RELYING ON CITIZENS' MORAL CAPACITY AS THE MAIN SAFEGUARDING FORCE. LIKE MANY OTHERS HE WAS CONVINCED THAT MEN IN A SOCIETY BECOME SELFISH AND GREEDY. BUT HE ALSO BELIEVED THAT THIS DISPOSITION, IF ADOPTED BY MANY, WILL EVENTUALLY UNDERMINE ITSELF. HE PROPOSED THE EXISTENCE OF A MECHANISM THAT WORKS AGAINST THE CONSCIOUS INTENTIONS OF SELFISH INDIVIDUALS, A SECRET PLAN OF NATURE THAT LEADS VERY SLOWLY AND "OVER MANY GENERATIONS" TO THE OVERALL REDUCTION OF GREEDINESS IN A SOCIETY. IN THE SHORT AND MIDDLE TERM HOWEVER, SUCH A STATE IS STRUCTURALLY UNSTABLE. IN MY ESSAY I ELABORATE ON THIS STRUCTURAL INSTABILITY FROM THREE INTERRELATED PERSPECTIVES: 1) FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF KANT'S SECRET PLAN OF NATURE; 2) FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LINK BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF THE STATE AND THE QUALITY OF THE CITIZEN AND 3) FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SECRET EXEMPTION AS THE PRINCIPAL MECHANISM STRUCTURALLY UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE FATE OF TWO TYPES OF HONEST PEOPLE - I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN KANT'S AND HUME'S TYPE - DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE STATE. WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AND THE KANT'S HONEST CITIZEN CANNOT EXIT THE STATE, ONLY A HIGH QUALITY STATE CAN SECURE HIS SURVIVAL. A HIGH QUALITY STATE ALSO GUARANTEES THE SECOND TYPE OF HONEST PERSON - HUME'S TYPE - THE RECIPROCITY THAT HE OR SHE NEEDS IN ORDER TO REMAIN HONEST. IN A LOW QUALITY OR 'FAILED' STATE HUME'S TYPE WILL SOONER OR LATER START CHEATING ON OTHERS AND VIOLATING THE LAW HIMSELF IN ORDER TO SURVIVE, WHILE THE KANT'S TYPE OF HONEST PERSON WILL PERISH.
920	A COMPLEX QUESTION IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH AN ENFORCEMENT COURT SHOULD DEFER TO THE DECISIONS OF COURTS AT THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION. IN THE RECENT CASE OF GUJARAT, THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA HELD THAT IT WOULD GENERALLY BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR AN AUSTRALIAN COURT, CALLED UPON TO ENFORCE AN ARBITRAL AWARD UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION ACT 1974 (CTH) (IAA), TO REACH A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ON THE SAME QUESTION AS THAT REACHED BY THE COURT AT THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES GUJARAT IN LIGHT OF THE BROADER DEBATE ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE SEAT IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION JURISPRUDENCE. THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE ROLE OF THE SEAT IS FAR FROM SETTLED. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THERE ARE COMPETING THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, EACH ACCORDING TO A DIFFERENT DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE TO THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION. SECOND, ENFORCEMENT COURTS APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW YORK CONVENTION HAVE TAKEN VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE DECISIONS OF COURTS AT THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION. US COURTS, FOR EXAMPLE, GENERALLY DEFER TO THE DECISIONS OF COURTS AT THE SEAT; FRENCH COURTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, TEND TO DISREGARD THE DECISIONS OF COURTS AT THE SEAT. NEVERTHELESS, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE DEFERENTIAL APPROACH TAKEN BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN GUJARAT AND THE US COURTS IS THE CORRECT ONE. AUSTRALIAN COURTS SHOULD, FOR STRONG POLICY REASONS, DEFER TO THE DECISIONS OF COURTS AT THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION, SAVE IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES WHERE SUCH DECISIONS ARE SHOWN ON THE BASIS OF COGENT EVIDENCE TO BE PARTIAL AND DEPENDENT OR IN VIOLATION OF BASIC PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE. THIS APPROACH PROMOTES FINALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION WHILST UPHOLDING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
921	NORMATIVE ARGUMENTS ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND LAWYERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE AND DEFEND CLAIMS OF MORALITY AND JUSTICE. IN RECENT YEARS, HOWEVER, COST-BENEFIT AND EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS APPEAR TO HAVE TAKEN OVER MOST LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND MANY LAW SCHOOL CLASSROOM DISCUSSIONS. SUCH ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE SOLE GOAL OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE TO MAXIMIZE HUMAN WELFARE, WHICH CAN BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED BY DEFERRING TO INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES, WHATEVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE, VALUING THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THOSE PREFERENCES BY REFERENCE TO MARKET VALUES, AND THEN CHOOSING RESULTS FOR WHICH THE SOCIAL BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THEIR SOCIAL COSTS. SUCH ANALYSIS IS WHOLLY WITHOUT ANY NORMATIVE WEIGHT UNLESS IT OCCURS WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF INSTITUTIONS, LAWS, AND PRACTICES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS IN A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. NORMATIVE ARGUMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO DEFINE THAT FRAMEWORK. SUCH ARGUMENTS ARE NOT MERELY EXPRESSIONS OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE BUT ARE EVALUATIVE ASSERTIONS AND MORAL DEMANDS WE ARE ENTITLED TO MAKE OF EACH OTHER. MORAL AND POLITICAL THEORY PROVIDE RESOURCES TO HELP LAWYERS MAKE EVALUATIVE ASSERTIONS ABOUT HUMAN VALUES THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM SHOULD RESPECT. AT THE SAME TIME, LAWYERS POSSESS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE IN ANALYZING, SHAPING, AND DEFENDING NORMATIVE CLAIMS, AND THE METHODS THEY USE SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO MORAL AND POLITICAL THEORISTS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS FOUR BASIC TASKS OF NORMATIVE ARGUMENTATION AND OUTLINES SEVERAL WAYS LAWYERS ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS. HIGHLIGHTING THESE METHODS WILL HELP LAWYERS IMPROVE THEM AND DEVELOP THE SKILLS NEEDED TO USE THEM. ARTICULATING AND EXPLORING THE CONTOURS OF THE METHODS USED BY LAWYERS TO MAKE AND DEFEND NORMATIVE ARGUMENTS WILL HELP ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO ARTICULATE NORMATIVE REASONS THAT CAN JUSTIFY LEGAL RIGHTS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A MANNER APPROPRIATE TO A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
922	HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS CRITICAL TO STRENGTHENING HEALTHCARE RESPONSES IN SETTINGS WITH CONFLICT-AFFECTED POPULATIONS. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE EXISTING EVIDENCE ON HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE IN SETTINGS WITH CONFLICT-AFFECTED POPULATIONS GLOBALLY. THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELIGIBLE STUDIES; (2) TO DESCRIBE THE PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE; (3) TO EXAMINE EVIDENCE ON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS FOR STRONGER HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE; AND (4) TO ANALYSE THE QUALITY OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW METHODOLOGY WAS USED FOLLOWING PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS CRITERIA. WE SEARCHED SIX ACADEMIC DATABASES AND USED GREY LITERATURE SOURCES. WE INCLUDED PAPERS REPORTING EMPIRICAL FINDINGS ON HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE AMONG POPULATIONS AFFECTED BY ARMED CONFLICT, INCLUDING REFUGEES, ASYLUM SEEKERS, INTERNALLY DISPLACED POPULATIONS, CONFLICT-AFFECTED NON-DISPLACED POPULATIONS AND POST-CONFLICT POPULATIONS. DATA WERE ANALYSED ACCORDING TO THE STUDY OBJECTIVES AND INFORMED PRIMARILY BY A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FROM THE LITERATURE. QUALITY APPRAISAL WAS CONDUCTED USING AN ADAPTED VERSION OF THE MIXED METHODS APPRAISAL TOOL. OF THE 6511 PAPERS IDENTIFIED THROUGH DATABASE SEARCHES, 34 STUDIES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. FEW STUDIES PROVIDED A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OR DEFINITION FOR GOVERNANCE. THE MOST FREQUENTLY IDENTIFIABLE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES RELATED TO PARTICIPATION AND COORDINATION, FOLLOWED BY EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS AND INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION. THE LEAST FREQUENTLY IDENTIFIABLE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES RELATED TO RULE OF LAW, ETHICS AND RESPONSIVENESS. ACROSS STUDIES, THE MOST COMMON FACILITATORS OF GOVERNANCE WERE COLLABORATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS, BOTTOM-UP AND COMMUNITY-BASED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, INCLUSIVE POLICIES AND LONGER-TERM VISION. THE MOST COMMON BARRIERS RELATED TO POOR COORDINATION, MISTRUST, LACK OF A HARMONIZED HEALTH RESPONSE, LACK OF CLARITY ON STAKEHOLDER RESPONSIBILITIES, FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND DONOR INFLUENCE. THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR MORE THEORETICALLY INFORMED EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE IN SETTINGS WITH CONFLICT-AFFECTED POPULATIONS THAT DRAWS ON EXISTING FRAMEWORKS FOR GOVERNANCE.
923	AS THE LATEST STUDIES OF FREEDOM HOUSE OR THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE SHOW, BUT ALSO MANY OTHER RESEARCHES, THE GLOBAL SOCIAL PHENOMENON AT LARGE SEEMS TO BE THE CRISIS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND ITS UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES AND VALUES. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF "POLITICAL CRISIS" HAS BECOME EXTREMELY POPULAR, USED BY BOTH THE MEDIA AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS IN GENERAL. OUR ARTICLE IS PROPOSED TO QUESTION THE CONCEPT OF "POLITICAL CRISIS" IN RELATION TO THE INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS AND THE CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES. THERE IS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES OF STATES CONSIDERED CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES OR FLAWED DEMOCRACIES IN WHICH THE NORMAL ELECTION CYCLES ARE COMPLETELY UPSET DUE TO THE INABILITY ID STRUCTURE GOVERNMENTAL MAJORITIES (ISRAEL, ITALY, SPAIN) OR WHERE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES CAUSE MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL BLOCKAGES (ROMANIA, FRANCE, USA), DEGENERATING INTO SOCIAL DEAVAGES NEAR THE LIMIT OF VIOLENCE. THEREFORE, THERE ARE MORE AND MORE VOICES WHO BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY POST-DEMOCRACY AND THAT THE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE ARE BEING REPLACED BY ILLIBERAL AND POPULIST PRINCIPLES. THEREFORE OUR RESEARCH QUESTION WOULD BE: ARE THE CHANGES OF POLITICAL PARADIGM THE EFFECT OR CAUSE OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY OR ON THE CONTRARY, WE ARE WITNESSING ONLY A CHANGE OF POLITICAL TENDENCY WITHIN DEMOCRACY? OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE BETWEEN STATES AND REGIMES CONSIDERED LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES AND FLAWED DEMOCRACIES. BUT IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS ANALYZES BASED MORE ON QUANTITATIVE STUDIES, WE WANT TO USE QUALITATIVE ANALYZES STARTING WITH SOME VARIABLES: THE RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS - AS QUALITATIVE PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS ACCESS TO RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - AS QUANTITATIVE PRINCIPLES. THE FACT THAT STATES SUCH AS USA, HUNGARY OR TURKEY LIMIT CITIZEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, CONSIDERED A DECADE AGO AS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DEFINITION OF DEMOCRACY, CAN BE EMPIRICALLY QUESTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY.
924	I AM THE LAW IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE TWO MORE DISPARATE CHARACTERS THAN JUDGE JOSEPH DREDD AND HERCULES J-THE ONE AN OVER-MUSCULAR, FACELESS AND HEAVILY ARMED STREET JUDGE ASTRIDE A LAWMASTER MOTORCYCLE WHO OVERIDENTIFIES WITH HIS ROLE ('I AM THE LAW'); THE OTHER DEVOID OF ANY PHYSICAL PRESENCE OR IMAGE, AND STRUCTURALLY DECOUPLED FROM THE EXECUTION OF LAW BY A FIERCE DETERMINATION TO MAINTAIN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH DREDD SO EFFORTLESSLY IGNORES. HERCULES J IS THE EMBODIMENT OF AN INTELLECTUALISED, YET CREATIVE, OPERATIONALISATION OF LAW. TO THE ACADEMIC SPIRIT, HERCULES IS INFINITELY PREFERABLE AS A MODEL OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM: HIS WORLD CONJURES A CONTEMPLATIVE MODALITY, EVER ALERT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF RIGHTS AND LARGELY ALIGNED WITH THE TEMPER OF THE POST-ENLIGHTENMENT. BY CONTRAST, DREDD IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE WORST ASPECTS OF LAW-AND-ORDER AS THE DEBASED AND POLITICISED MANIFESTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. HIS IS AN INTENSELY VISCERAL PRESENCE, THE METONYMIC BLINDNESS OF THEMIS REPLACED BY THE DREDD'S FRACTURED EYELINE: BLINDNESS AS A SIGNIFIER OF IMPARTIALITY YIELDS TO BLINDNESS AS A SYMPTOM OF INSTITUTIONAL RAGE. THIS ARTICLE INTERROGATES THE CHARACTERS, ACTIONS AND VALUES OF HERCULES J AND DREDD J, VIEWED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE LENS OF JACQUES DERRIDA'S FORCE OF LAW, FOCUSING ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND VIOLENCE AS IT IS EXPOSED (OR HIDDEN) IN HERCULES'S AND DREDD'S WORLDS, AND THEN TURNING TO JUDICIAL CONFRONTATION WITH THE APORETIC: THE APORIAS, IDENTIFIED BY DERRIDA AND OTHERS, THAT LAW MUST CONFRONT. THE INTERROGATION CONTINUES, FINALLY CONTEMPLATING THE CURRENT STATE OF LAW IN THE COMMON LAW WORLD-THE WORLD OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, SUGGESTING THAT THE HIGH POINT OF DEMOCRACY MAY WELL HAVE PASSED, AND THAT WE ARE ON A DREDD-WARD TRAJECTORY.
925	IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW, EVERY PERSON (INCLUDING STATE AUTHORITIES) MUST BEAR A LEGAL LIABILITY FOR AN UNLAWFUL ACT COMMITTED. HOWEVER, RECENT SOCIO-POLITICAL EVENTS IN SLOVAKIA HAVE BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT A NUMBER OF LEGAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE LIABILITY OF THE HEAD OF THE STATE FOR HIS UNLAWFUL ACTS. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT LEGAL REGULATION OF PRESIDENTIAL LIABILITY, WHICH BELONGS TO ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF THE SLOVAK LEGAL ORDER. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS AN ISSUE WHICH IS NOT A FREQUENTED SUBJECT OF LEGAL SCIENCE (JURISPRUDENCE) RESEARCH. THEREFORE, ITS EXAMINATION AND CRITICAL EVALUATION IS NECESSARY. HOWEVER, THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS NOT ONLY TO POINT OUT TO THE CURRENT LEGAL REGULATION OF THIS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED LEGAL INSTITUTION, BUT ALSO TO SHOW ITS SEAMY SIDES AND TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIBLE AND REASONABLE LEGAL OPINION RELATING TO KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF LEGAL LIABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC. THE AUTHORS ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE LIABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC IS EXTREMELY BRIEF. IN ADDITION, IT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF AMBIGUITIES AND QUESTIONS WHICH, IN THE FUTURE, CAN CAUSE A LOT OF COMPLICATIONS IN THE EVENTUAL PROSECUTION OF THE PRESIDENT. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS MORE THAN DESIRABLE TO RESOLVE AT LEAST SOME OF THE ISSUES REFERRED TO IN THE PAPER BEFORE THE DISPUTE ARISES. IN EVERY DEMOCRATIC STATE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE TERMS OF APPLICATION OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS OR LEGAL PROVISIONS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE, CLEAR, AND CERTAIN. IN THE CASE OF THE INSTITUTION OF LIABILITY OF THE SLOVAK PRESIDENT, THIS REQUIREMENT IS CERTAINLY NOT FULFILLED.
926	OVER MUCH OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, RECURRING PROBLEMS OF COVERT AND OPPORTUNISTIC CONFLICT BETWEEN SETTLERS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES PRODUCED CONSIDERABLE DEBATE ACROSS THE BRITISH SETTLER WORLD ABOUT HOW FRONTIER VIOLENCE COULD BE LEGALLY CURBED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DIFFICULTY OF IMPOSING A RULE OF LAW ON NEW FRONTIERS WAS OFTEN SEEN BY COLONIAL STATES AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE IMPOSITION OF ORDER THROUGH FORCE. EXAMINING ALL THE MAINLAND AUSTRALIAN COLONIES FROM THE 1830S TO THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THIS PAPER ASKS HOW THIS CONTRADICTORY DILEMMA PLAYED OUT THROUGH DEPLOYMENT OF NATIVE POLICE' AND THE CIVILISING' ROLE OF LEGALISED VIOLENCE AS A STRATEGY FOR MANAGING THE SETTLER FRONTIER. IN LIGHT OF WIDER DEBATE ABOUT A HUMANELY ADMINISTERED EMPIRE, AUSTRALIA'S FIRST NATIVE POLICE FORCE ESTABLISHED IN NEW SOUTH WALES IN 1837 WAS CONCEIVED AS A MEASURE THAT WOULD ASSIST IN THE CONCILIATION AND AMELIORATION' OF ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. IN THE COMING DECADES, OTHER AUSTRALIAN COLONIES EMPLOYED NATIVE POLICE EITHER AS DEDICATED FORCES OR AS INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANTS ATTACHED TO MOUNTED POLICE DETACHMENTS. OVER TIME, THE CAPACITY THEY HELD TO IMPOSE EXTREME VIOLENCE ON ABORIGINAL POPULATIONS IN THE SERVICE OF PROTECTING PASTORAL INVESTMENTS CAME TO REFLECT AN IMPLICIT ACCEPTANCE THAT PUNITIVE MEASURES WERE REQUIRED TO BRING ORDER TO DISORDERLY FRONTIERS.BY TRACING A GRADUAL SHIFT IN THE PERCEIVED ROLE OF NATIVE POLICE FROM ONE OF CIVILISING' ABORIGINAL PEOPLE TO ONE OF CIVILISING' THE SETTLER STATE ITSELF, THIS PAPER DRAWS OUT SOME OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH STATE-SANCTIONED FORCE BECAME NATURALISED AND LEGITIMATED. IT CONCLUDES THAT, AS AN INSTRUMENT OF FRONTIER MANAGEMENT, NATIVE POLICING REFLECTED AN ENDURING PROBLEM FOR AUSTRALIA'S COLONIAL GOVERNMENTS IN RECONCILING A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO TREAT ABORIGINAL PEOPLE AS SUBJECTS OF THE CROWN WITH A PERCEIVED REQUIREMENT TO BRING THEM UNDER COLONIAL AUTHORITY THROUGH THE SALUTARY LESSONS' OF LEGALISED VIOLENCE.
927	WITHIN THE SOCIALLY ESTABLISHED CULTURAL, MORAL, AND LEGAL BOUNDARIES, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING HOMELESSNESS GLOBALLY, THE FACTORS THAT CAUSE OR TRIGGER AND FOSTER PERMANENCE ON THE STREETS, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED CHARACTERISTICS. THIS PHENOMENON REPRESENTS A SPECIAL TYPE OF CONFLICT THAT NEEDS TO BE PUT ON THE AGENDAS OF LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE CASE OF BOGOTA, OFFICIAL DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF PUBLIC SECURITY (LEGAL AND ILLEGAL) HAVE CREATED AN IMAGE OF HOMELESS PERSONS BY STEREOTYPING THEM AS PRODUCERS AND REPRODUCERS OF THE FEARS OF THE CITY'S "NORMAL" INHABITANTS. FOLLOWING GARCIA-CANCLINI (2004) AND FRASER (1997), THE ARTICLE AFFIRMS THE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AS A HISTORICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON THAT REQUIRES FURTHER UNDERSTANDING FRONT THE PERSPECTIVE OF INEQUALITY AND DIFFERENCE. CONSEQUENTLY, IT SETS OUT TO REVIEW THE CONTINUITIES AND DISCONTINUITIES IN THE DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES OF RECOGNITION OF HOMELESSNESS BETWEEN 1995 AND 2015, FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF VERON'S (2004) THEORY OF DISCOURSE AND VAN DIJK'S (2003) CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (CDA). CDA MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO TRACK MACRO-TEXTUAL AND MICRO-TEXTUAL ELEMENTS. THE FORMER INCLUDE GLOBAL AND LOCAL CONCEPTS, POSITIONS OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED, AND CAUSAL EXPLANATIONS, AMONG OTHERS, WHILE THE LATTER TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WAYS OF CONSTITUTING THE GROUP THROUGH NOUNS, ADJECTIVES, AND VERBS FOUND IN THE NORMATIVE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVIDE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR POLITICAL DECISIONS. THE PERIOD OF ANALYSIS WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIONS INVOLVED WERE SITUATED IN A CONTEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THAT SAW THE BIRTH OF THE SOCIAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FORMALIZATION OF AN INSTITUTIONAL APPARATUS AIMED AT GUARANTEEING CITIZENS' RIGHTS. AT CITY LEVEL, THIS TRANSLATED INTO THE CREATION OF SPECIALIZED AND TECHNICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS.
928	ACCORDING TO THE EU'S 2009 GREEN PAPER ON THE REFORM OF THE CFP, 81% OF EUROPEAN FISH STOCKS ARE OVERFISHED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EU HAS REPEATEDLY COMMITTED ITSELF UNDER BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND EU LAW TO MAINTAINING AND RESTORING ITS FISH STOCKS TO LEVELS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING MSY. HERE WE ARGUE THAT THE EU'S REPEATED ENACTMENT OF TACS EXCEEDING MAXIMUM REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL HAS VIOLATED THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE AND AS SUCH CONSTITUTES A BREACH OF EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. AS A POLICY DECISION, A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH THE EU IS ENDOWED WITH EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE IN REGARD TO MARINE CONSERVATION, THIS COMPETENCE MUST BE EXERCISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. JUDICIAL REVIEW IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT IN ENSURING THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS, HOWEVER THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED NATURE OF FISHERIES POLICY HINDERS MEMBER STATES AND EU INSTITUTIONS FROM CHALLENGING NON-SUSTAINABLE TACS. DESPITE EFFORTS TO EXPAND STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION IN FISHERIES POLICY-MAKING, ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS WWF-UK HAVE BEEN DENIED STANDING TO CHALLENGE EU FISHERIES POLICY IN EUROPEAN COURTS, LEAVING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE UNADDRESSED AND DENYING JUDICIAL PROTECTION GUARANTEED UNDER THE AARHUS CONVENTION. THE ECJ'S 2011 DECISION IN BUND V. BEZIRKSREGIERUNG ARNSBERG ("TRIANEL") MAY REPRESENT A TURNING POINT IN THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF DIRECT AND INDIVIDUAL CONCERN IN REGARD TO CASES INSTITUTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS IN A PRECAUTIONARY CONTEXT. RATHER THAN MERELY DEVELOPING NEW POLICY TOOLS, GENUINE AND COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE CFP ALSO REQUIRES AN OPERABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT VIOLATIONS OF THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE BY EU INSTITUTIONS IN ENACTING FISHERIES POLICIES CAN BE ADDRESSED.

929	IN THIS NOTE WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE OF THE ANTI-TRUST LAWS. RATHER WE WISH TO DIRECT ATTENTION TO CERTAIN PROBLEM AREAS FOR STUDY. WE ASSUME FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION THAT AN OVER-RIDING BELIEF IN BOTH FREE ENTERPRISE AND IN COMPETITION WILL PREVAIL OVER FUTURE POSSIBLE NRA ATTEMPTS. WE ASSUME ALSO THAT DESPITE THE EXTENSION OF A GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, THERE WILL STILL BE A PLACE FOR REGULATION BY COMPETITION. THE ABILITY OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS IN WEATHERING NRA AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION ATTEMPTS IN THE PAST PROVIDES A BASIS FOR ASSUMING THE LAWS WILL CONTINUE. THE DURABILITY OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS IS PERHAPS THEIR MAIN CHARACTERISTIC. IN LARGE MEASURE, THIS IS A COMMON LAW DURABILITY, BUILT ON A CASE BY CASE DEVELOPMENT, AND EXHIBITING THAT FLEXIBILITY IS NOW LIMITED BY PARTICULARIZING LEGISLATION ENACTED TO ACCOMPANY THE SHERMAN ACT. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, INDEED, THE SHERMAN ACT HAS EXHIBITED THE TWIN TENDENCIES OF FLEXIBILITY AND AMBIGUITY, ON THE ONE HAND, AND A DRIVE FOR CERTAINTY AND AUTOMATICITY, ON THE OTHER. AT THE MOMENT, THE DRIVE FOR CERTAINTY AND AUTOMATICITY SEEMS PARAMOUNT, BUT NOT WITHOUT CRITICISM AND REACTION. MUCH OF THIS DRIVE FOR CERTAINTY RESTS NOT SO MUCH ON THE CONCEPT OF FAIR WARNING, WHICH IS INHERENT IN ANY IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT RATHER MORE ON THE BELIEF THAT NEW AND AUTOMATIC APPLICATIONS OF THE LAWS WILL CATCH OBJECTIONABLE CONDUCT AND EFFECTS IN THEIR INCIPIENCY. THE IDEA OF INCIPIENCY SEEMS TO REST OF ECONOMIC DOCTRINES, OR, CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE. BECAUSE OF THESE DOCTRINES OR CONCLUSIONS, CERTAIN TYPES OF CONDUCT ARE DEEMED HARMFUL IN THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH THE HARM IN THE PARTICULAR CASE MAY NOT BE VISIBLE. ECONOMIC THEORY OR EXPERIENCE THUS SUBSTITUTES FOR AN OBSERVED EFFECT.
930	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE WORK OF THE FAMOUS SCHOLAR, DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY, PROFESSOR S. I. DUDNIK, HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHY OF ST. PETERSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY. THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF HIS CONCEPT OF THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT, THE FORMATION OF RUSSIAN STATEHOOD, THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE CONSIDERED. IN HIS WORKS, HE FOCUSED ON THE NEED FOR A SYNTHESIS OF HISTORICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIO-CULTURAL AND AXIOLOGICAL STUDIES. THE VIEWS OF S. I. DUDNIK ON THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND HUMANISTIC ASPECTS OF THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF CLASSICAL AND SOVIET MARXISM, THE FEATURES OF THE IDEOLOGY OF SOCIALISM AND CONSERVATISM, THE PREREQUISITES FOR THE "TOTALITARIAN MUTATION" OF THE SOVIET SOCIETY. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES THE WORKS BY S. I. DUDNIK DEVOTED TO THE TRADITIONS OF PHILOSOPHICAL EDUCATION AT ST. PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY. THESE INCLUDE RECEPTIVITY TO EVERYTHING RELEVANT AND PROGRESSIVE IN WORLD PHILOSO-PHY, A CLOSE CONNECTION WITH CLASSICAL DOMESTIC AND WORLD PHILOSOPHY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A METHODOLOGY FOR POLITICS AND POLITICAL CULTURE. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SCHOLAR ANALYZED THE ST. PETERSBURG EXPERIENCE OF THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IN RUSSIA DURING THE EIGHTEENTH - TWENTIETH CENTURIES AND THE FORMATION OF SCI-ENCE AS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE LIFE OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY. A SPECIAL PLACE IN RUSSIAN SCIENCE IS OCCUPIED WITH THE RESEARCH BY S. I. DUDNIK OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE, THE MODERN RUSSIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT PROFESSOR S. I. DUDNIK IS A WORTHY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ST. PETERSBURG PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOL, A SUCCESSOR TO ITS BEST TRADITIONS; UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, THE INSTITUTE OF PHILOSOPHY OF ST PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS POSITION AS THE FLAGSHIP OF DOMESTIC PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH, ONE OF THE CENTERS OF WORLD PHILOSOPHY.
931	THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE INTEGRATED CONCEPT OF SPORT IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA, FOCUSED ON ELEMENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, PROTECTION OF MINORS, FIGHT AGAINST DOPING AND CORRUPTION. SPORT IS A FIELD THAT CONTRIBUTES SUBSTANTIALLY TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH OF A STATE, ENSURING AN ADDED VALUE IN ITS GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND THE INSERTION OF THE SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD ON THE LABOR MARKET. NATIONAL SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE REFERENCE FIELD, ITS INTEGRITY IN ORDER TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE POSITIVE VALUES OF SPORT AND TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF LIFE WITH ITS SUPPORT. MOREOVER, ENSURING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN NATIONAL SPORT IS DICTATED BY THE RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTONOMY AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS (REGULATIONS, INSTRUCTIONS, METHODOLOGIES, ETC.). THUS, GOOD GOVERNANCE MUST "ENSURE THE PROPER OBSERVANCE AND REGULATION OF THE FIELD THROUGH THE PRINCIPLES OF EFFICIENT, TRANSPARENT, ETHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT, SPORTS DIPLOMACY, FAIR PLAY, PARTICIPATORY MANAGEMENT, PROCESSES AND STRUCTURES WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS" EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT RESOLUTION OF 2 FEBRUARY 2017 ON AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO SPORT POLICY: GOOD GOVERNANCE, ACCESSIBILITY AND INTEGRITY 2016/2143 (INI). GOOD GOVERNANCE IS NEEDED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF SPORT AND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. DOPING AND CORRUPTION IN SPORT, IDENTIFIED AT NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LEVEL, LEAD TO THE CREATION OF AN INADEQUATE IMAGE OF SPORT. ALSO, RESPECT AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY OF MINORS, MUST BE NATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE CAN ASSERT THAT THE ELABORATION OF THE PRAXIOLOGICAL MODEL OF THE INTEGRATED CONCEPT OF SPORT AT NATIONAL LEVEL CAN STRENGTHEN THE ADJUSTMENT DIRECTIONS THROUGH MODIFICATIONS / PROPOSALS TO THE LOCAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT REGULATES THE REFERENCE FIELD IN CONSENSUS WITH THE EUROPEAN ONE.
932	CORRUPTION IS A VICE THAT CONTINUES TO AFFLICT MANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, THOSE OF AFRICA INCLUSIVE. IT IS INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. THOSE INVOLVED IN CORRUPTION SUBVERT HONESTY WHILE PRIVILEGING DEPRAVITY. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE MORAL FIBRE OF A PEOPLE BECOMES ERODED AS CORRUPTION TAKES THE CENTRE STAGE. CORRUPTION HAS BEEN A COMMON SUBJECT MATTER IN MANY LITERARY WORKS. SUCH WORKS HAVE DEPICTED THE RULING CLASS AND THEIR HENCHMEN INVOLVING THEMSELVES IN THE MORASS, EVENTUALLY BRINGING NATIONS ECONOMIES TO THEIR KNEES. WHILE LITERARY CRITICS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF POLITICIANS AND TYCOONS IN CORRUPTION IN LITERARY WORKS, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A NUMBER OF MINORITIES IN THE MALFEASANCE. THIS ARTICLE, WHICH IS HINGED ON AFRICAN FEMINISM AS ESPOUSED BY GWENDOLYN MIKELL AND OREYONKE OYEWUMI REPORTS THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ROLE OF THE PROSTITUTES IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CORRUPTION IN TANZANIA'S BEN MTOBWA'S PESA ZAKO ZINANUKA (YOUR MONEY STINKS) AND DARES SALAAM USIKU (DARES SALAAM BY NIGHT). THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PROSTITUTION IS HIERARCHICAL AND ASYMMETRICAL IN MALE-FEMALE RELATIONS. MALE CLIENTS EXERT POWER AND DOMINATION OVER THE FEMALE PROSTITUTES, AND LITTLE WONDER THAT HARLOTS ACCRUE ANY SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT PROSTITUTES ARE INTEGRAL TO CORRUPTION AS THEY CAVORT WITH POLITICIANS AND TYCOONS, WHERE THEY ARE USED AS SIDEKICKS, WHILE IN OTHER INSTANCES THEY PLAY THE ROLE OF CONDUITS IN SCAMS. THEY ARE ALSO USED AS COVERT SECURITY OPERATORS FOR THE CORRUPT, WHILE PLAYING STUMBLING BLOCKS TO THE ANTICORRUPTION CRUSADERS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF THE SUBORDINATION OF WOMEN AS A SECTION OF MENFOLK THRIVE IN CORRUPTION.
933	OVER THE PAST YEARS, INDONESIA, THE WORLD'S FOURTH MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY, HAS CONFRONTED ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS DUE TO UNCONTROLLED GENERATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW). WHILE THE INTEGRATED SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT (ISWM) REPRESENTS A CRITICAL STRATEGY FOR INDONESIA TO CONTROL ITS PRODUCTION, IT IS ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT ECONOMIC APPROACHES ALSO NEED TO BE PROMOTED TO ADDRESS THE WASTE PROBLEM CONCERTEDLY. IN THIS CASE STUDY, EMPIRICAL APPROACHES ARE DEVELOPED TO UNDERSTAND HOW A VOLUME-BASED WASTE FEE COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO MSW COLLECTION SERVICES AND HOW TO APPLY A ZERO-WASTE APPROACH IN INDONESIA BY ADAPTING RESOURCE RECOVERY INITIATIVES, ADAPTED FROM GERMANY'S MATURE EXPERIENCES IN INTEGRATING THE CE PARADIGM INTO THE LATTER'S MSWM PRACTICES. CURRENTLY, SUKUNAN VILLAGE (YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA) PROMOTES WASTE REDUCTION AT SOURCES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMUNITY-BASED SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT (CBSWM) BY MOBILIZING THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR WASTE SEPARATION (ORGANIC AND NONORGANIC) AND WASTE RECYCLING. AS A RESULT, ABOUT 0.2 MILLION MT OF CO2-CQ EMISSIONS WAS AVOIDED ANNUALLY FROM LOCAL LANDFILLS. THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF RECYCLING ACTIVITIES BY THE VILLAGE'S COMMUNITY ALSO RESULTED IN 30% REDUCTION OF THE WASTE GENERATED. THIS CBSWM SCHEME NOT ONLY SAVES THE GOVERNMENT BUDGET ON WASTE COLLECTION, TRANSPORT AND DISPOSAL, BUT ALSO EXTENDS THE LIFETIME OF LOCAL LANDFILLS AS THE FINAL DISPOSAL SITES. BY INTEGRATING THE CE PARADIGM INTO ITS MSWM PRACTICES THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SAME WAY AS GERMANY DOES, INDONESIA COULD MAKE POSITIVE CHANGES TO ITS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND REGULATION OF MSW. A SOUND MSWM IN INDONESIA COULD PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN PROMOTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT WITH RESOURCE RECOVERY APPROACHES TO FACILITATE ITS TRANSITION TOWARDS A CE NATIONWIDE IN THE LONG-TERM.

934	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE ATTEMPTS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE REHABILITATION AND RESTORATION PROCESSES OF THE VIOLATED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS IN THE KAZAKH SSR, WHICH BEGAN WITH N. KHRUSHCHEV'S REPORT AT THE XX CONGRESS OF THE CPSU. AFTER STALIN'S DEATH, THE USSR LEADERSHIP UNDERSTOOD THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE "GREAT TERROR" RESULTED IN A HIGH LEVEL OF THE HIDDEN SOCIAL TENSIONS OVER THE WHOLE OF SOVIET SOCIETY, AND ITS EXACERBATION MAY LEAD TO UNPREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES. BASED ON ARCHIVAL MATERIALS, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF THE FORMER PARTY, SOVIET AND KOMSOMOL WORKERS OF KAZAKHSTAN WHO RETURNED FROM CAMPS AND EXILE AND PRESENTED THE LIVE EVIDENCE OF THE TRAGEDY THAT BEFELL THEM. THIS EVIDENCE FILLED OUT THE PICTURE OF MASS REPRESSION IN KAZAKHSTAN IN 1937-1938 WITH SOME DETAILS AND DIRECTLY CALLED OUT THE ACTORS OF THE "STALINIST TERROR" PROCESS, WHICH HAS BEEN MAINLY IMPERSONAL. THE ARTICLE TALKS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THOSE PERSONS WHO SUPPLIED THE IDEOLOGICAL SUPPORT OF THE REPRESSION OF THE 1930S IN KAZAKHSTAN AND SANCTIONED LAWLESSNESS. MANY OF THEM HELD IMPORTANT POSITIONS IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY GOVERNMENT OF KAZAKHSTAN, ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE KAZAKH SSR AND OTHER FIELDS OF THE PRESS, EDUCATION AND CULTURE AFTER 1956. KNOWING ABOUT THE PEOPLE RETURNING FROM THE CAMPS AND EXILE, THEY ATTEMPTED TO SET OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE ANTI-STALINIST COURSE IN SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF THE REPUBLIC. SPEAKING ABOUT THE ATTEMPTS OF THE VICTIMS OF STALINIST TYRANNY TO RESTORE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, THE ARTICLE DOES NOT AVOIDED THE ROLE OF THE KAZAKH SSR KGB, IN WHOSE HANDS THE INIQUITY 1930S-1950S LAY. THE RESTORATION AND STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE RETURN OF STATE SECURITY AUTHORITIES TO THE LEGAL FIELD HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF SOVIET LEADERSHIP IN THE ERA OF KHRUSHCHEV'S "THAW".
935	LEGALITY IS A SYSTEM OF REQUIREMENTS AND PRINCIPLES, WHICH GUARANTEE IMPLEMENTATION OF FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL VALUES IN RELEVANT LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL NORMS, ITS REALIZATION IN ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF ALL PARTICIPANTS OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. THE MAIN STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE LEGALITY ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY, THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, THE MECHANISM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY. THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY ARE CORRESPONDENCE OF LEGISLATION TO REAL NEEDS OF SOCIAL RELATIONS; IMPLEMENTATION OF WILL AND INTERESTS OF THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS IN LAWS; THE COMPLIANCE OF LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL ACTS TO THE NATURAL LAW AND MORAL PRINCIPLES; LEGISLATIVE RECOGNITION OF THE INALIENABILITY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF A PERSON AND A CITIZEN; THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SYSTEM OF LEGISLATION; STRICT OBSERVANCE OF COMPETENCE AND PROCEDURE OF PASSING LAWS AND LEGAL ACTS; THE REQUIREMENT OF STRICT AND CONSTANT LAW OBSERVANCE AND OBEYANCE OF LAWS BY ALL SUBJECTS OF LAW; EXISTENCE OF A CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT SYSTEM OVER STRICT AND CONSTANT LAW OBSERVANCE AND OBEYANCE OF LAWS BY ALL LEGAL SUBJECTS, INCLUDING THE STATE, ITS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICIALS. THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY ARE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE HIERARCHY IN THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL ACTS, UNITY OF THE LEGALITY, REASONABILITY OF THE LEGALITY, INADMISSIBILITY OF THE OPPOSITION OF LAW AND JUSTICE, UNIVERSALITY OF THE LEGALITY. THE MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY INCLUDES: - THE SYSTEM OF STATE AUTHORITY, ALLOWING TO ENACT LAWS APPROPRIATE TO THE NEEDS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, TO CREATE METHODS AND FACILITIES TO IDENTIFY SUCH NEEDS, EXCLUDING NEGATIVE EFFECTS SUCH AS VOLUNTARISM AND SUBJECTIVISM IN LAWMAKING, THE LAG OF LAW FROM THE CHANGING NEEDS OF SOCIETY, HINDERING SOCIAL PROGRESS; - THE MECHANISM OF IDENTIFICATION OF INEFFICIENT LEGAL NORMS, SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF NEW SOCIAL RELATIONS, COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC PREDICTION OF POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF NEW LAWS; - MECHANISM OF LEGAL EDUCATION.
936	LAW AND LANGUAGE ARE INTERWOVEN. LAW IS A TOOL FOR THE REGULATION OF SOCIAL ORDER. ITS EFFICIENCY RELIES ON THE USE OF APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE ITS PRINCIPLES. IF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO BE RESPECTED AS THE BEDROCK OF JUSTICE LAW ITSELF HAS TO BE RELEVANT TO EVERYDAY LIFE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WITHIN ITS TERRITORIAL REACH, WHETHER ON A NATIONAL OR AN INTERNATIONAL PLANE. REFORM OF THE LAW IS A NECESSARY AND CONTINUING PROCESS. IT IS ABOUT KEEPING THE LAW UP-TO-DATE, ENSURING THAT ITS UNDERLYING PURPOSE IS TRANSMITTED IN AS EFFECTIVE A MANNER AS POSSIBLE. AS SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES, AS CULTURAL NORMS DEVELOP, LAW ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF DISCIPLINES IS CHALLENGED TO KEEP PACE WITH THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES. LANGUAGE IS THE VEHICLE BY WHICH LAW IS DELIVERED. WORDS AND PHRASES, EVEN CONCEPTS, USED FIFTY OR A HUNDRED YEARS AGO MAY NOT BE APPOSITE FOR THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT. TODAY THERE IS GREATER DEMAND FOR LAW TO BE LESS OBSCURE, WHERE PRACTICABLE LESS COMPLEX AND OVER-ELABORATE, FOR IT TO BE WRITTEN IN PLAIN TERMS, AND FOR THOSE WHO PRACTISE IT TO BE LESS ELITIST. LAW NEEDS TO BE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO CITIZENS AT LARGE. IN THIS LINGUISTICS HAS A GROWING ROLE TO PLAY. THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE AND HOW IT IS CONSTRUCTED AND EMPLOYED HAS LESSONS FOR STATUTORY DRAFTERS (AS CREATORS OF LAW) AT ONE END OF THE LEGAL SPECTRUM AND FOR LAWYER-ADVISERS AND COURTS (AS INTERPRETERS OF LAW) AT THE OTHER. LAW-MAKERS AND LAWUSERS NEED LAW TO BE COHERENT AND PRESENTED IN A MANNER WHICH MINIMISES MISUNDERSTANDING AND MISAPPLICATION. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND FOCUSSED CODIFICATION ARE STEPS IN THAT LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IT HELPS PARLIAMENTARIANS, POLICY MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO MATTER - US.
937	HUNGARY AND POLAND HAVE STARTED THEIR ILLIBERAL REMODELLING IN 2010 AND 2015 RESPECTIVELY. BOTH GOVERNMENTS ROUTINELY APPLY THE ILLIBERAL VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW (ILLIBERAL LEGALITY), WHICH INVOLVES THAT EVERY SITUATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE EXPLOITED FOR POLITICAL GAIN. BOTH STATES OPPORTUNISTICALLY APPLY THEIR CONSTITUTIONS AND SELECTIVELY INVOKE FAVOURABLE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS. AND YET, THIS PAPER CLAIMS THAT THE HUNGARIAN FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND THE POLISH CONSTITUTION ARE EQUIPPED WITH ADEQUATE EMERGENCY MEASURES TO PROVIDE FOR A PROPER FRAMEWORK FOR EMERGENCY LEGISLATION. IN ILLIBERAL EMERGENCY CONSTITUTIONALISM, HUNGARY USES AND ABUSES ITS FUNDAMENTAL LAW, WHILE POLAND IS DISREGARDING ITS BINDING 1997 CONSTITUTION AND, AT THE SAME TIME, CREATES ITS NEW INVISIBLE ILLIBERAL CONSTITUTION. THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW IT IS DONE DURING THE CURRENT HUMAN PANDEMIC CRISIS BY FOCUSING ON, FIRST, THE EMERGENCY REGIMES THE CONSTITUTIONS PROVIDE FOR AND THEIR (NON-)APPLICATION. SECOND, IT COMPARES THE OPERATION OF THE PARLIAMENTS AS THE SEJM CHAOTICALLY PASSES CRISIS MANAGEMENT RELATED OMNIBUS LEGISLATION AND AMENDMENTS ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DURING THE EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL 'STATE OF EPIDEMIC'. THE HUNGARIAN PARLIAMENT OPERATES UNDER THE 'DANGER OF CRISIS'. YET, IT STILL DELIVERS REGULAR LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES, AS THE EMERGENCY 'LEGISLATION' IS DONE THROUGH GOVERNMENTAL DECREE AS PER THE CORONAVIRUS ACT 2020, WHICH IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THESE PHENOMENA NECESSITATE AN IN-DEPTH INQUIRY ABOUT THE NATURE, FORM, AND CONTENT OF THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH EMERGENCY LEGISLATION AND GOVERNMENTAL DECREES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL MEASURES SET FOR GUIDING THE AUTHORITIES IN EMERGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL SETTING AND COVID-19 CRISIS, THE FORM AND THE CONTENT OF SOME ESSENTIAL HUNGARIAN AND POLISH EMERGENCY MEASURES STAY BELOW STANDARDS. IT IS A FURTHER WARNING SIGN FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY TO TAKE HUNGARIAN AND POLAND ILLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM SERIOUSLY. THEIR PUSHING THE ENVELOPE WILL NOT END BY ITSELF.
938	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES WHETHER THE GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE EU'S FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY ADDS NEW SIGNIFICANCE TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITMENT SPELLED OUT IN EU TREATIES AND ELABORATED IN OTHER SECTORAL, STRATEGIC DOCUMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, IT INVESTIGATES WHETHER THE STRATEGY'S TAKE ON HUMAN RIGHTS CONTINUES OR COMPLEMENTS THE UNION'S EARLIER APPROACH IN THE FIELD OR PRIORITISES THEM IN THE UNION'S ACTIVITIES. THE ARTICLE COMMENCES WITH AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE MODALITIES THROUGH WHICH THE NEW STRATEGY VOICES HUMAN RIGHTS BOTH AS VALUES AND OBJECTIVES IN EU EXTERNAL POLICIES. THIS IS DONE AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF COHERENCE AND RESILIENCE AS ORGANISING CONCEPTS OF THE UNION'S EXTERNAL ACTION AND THE GLOBAL STRATEGY ITSELF. IT GOES ON TO DRAW FROM OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS OF THREE CASE STUDIES AS FOCUSED ON THE EU HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW FAILURE AT HOME (POLAND AND HUNGARY), AT ITS BORDERS (IN RELATION TO MIGRATION), AND IN ITS CLOSEST VICINITY (UKRAINE). THESE SERVE AS THE BACKGROUND FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PURSUIT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OBJECTIVES IS CONTINUED, COMPLEMENTED OR PRIORITISED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF AND WITH THE USE OF THE TWO FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS. IT IS CONTENDED THAT COHERENCE AND RESILIENCE ADVANCE (IF AT TIMES MODESTLY) THE EXISTING EU HUMAN RIGHTS AGENDA, CONTINUING EARLIER APPROACHES (FOR EXAMPLE, ENSURING A COMPREHENSIVE HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO CONFLICT AND CRISIS) OR COMPLEMENTING THEM (FOR EXAMPLE, USING AND INVESTING IN ALL INSTRUMENTS AIMED AT CONFLICT PREVENTION, MANAGEMENT, RESOLUTION AND STABILISATION; CONNECTING THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPHERES AND POLICIES). THE MIGRATION POLICYREMAINS A PROBLEMATIC ONE, AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RHETORICAL COMMITMENT TO THE PRIORITISATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DOES NOT STAND TRIAL WITH THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE IN EUROPEAN AND WORLD POLITICS.
939	THIS ESSAY SEEKS TO ILLUMINATE THE SUPREME COURT'S HABEAS CORPUS CASES ARISING FROM THE WAR ON TERROR UP THROUGH THE 2008 DECISION IN BOUMEDIENE V. BUSH BY SUPPLEMENTING TRADITIONAL LEGAL ANALYSIS WITH THREE PROPOSITIONS DERIVED FROM RECENT POLITICAL SCIENCE LITERATURE. FIRST, THE SPACE FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IS "POLITICALLY CONSTRUCTED" BY THE TOLERANCES OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT, AS SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC OPINION. CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROPOSITION, THE SUPREME COURT HAS OPERATED MOSTLY ON THE MARGINS OF THE NATION'S WAR ON TERROR POLICY, BUT HAS GROWN MORE ASSERTIVE SINCE THE NEAR AFTERMATH OF 9/11 IN RECOGNITION OF A CHANGING POLITICAL CLIMATE AND A LESSENING SENSE OF THE URGENCY OF THE TERRORIST THREAT. SECOND, GEORGE W BUSH WAS A FAILED "RECONSTRUCTIVE PRESIDENT" WHO CAME UP SHORT IN HIS EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC AND THE COURTS TO EMBRACE A CONSTITUTIONAL VISION OF VAST, UNILATERAL, AND JUDICIALLY UNREVIEWABLE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AUTHORITY TO COMBAT TERRORIST THREATS. THIRD, THE SUPREME COURT IS A "THEY," NOT AN "IT," WHOSE WAR ON TERROR RULINGS HAVE OFTEN REFLECTED, AS FUTURE DECISIONS ARE LIKELY ALSO TO REPRESENT, THE CHANCE DOMINANCE OF THE VIEW OF THE MEDIAN JUSTICE. BECAUSE JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS CAST THE DECISIVE VOTE IN A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CASES, THE EMERGING DOCTRINE BEARS HIS DISTINCTIVE STAMP. IN MATTERS INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY, HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF FINAL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTED ISSUES BY JUDICIAL DOCTRINE IS SMALLER THAN IN LESS FRAUGHT AREAS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. SHOULD THE WAR ON TERROR BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TERRIFYING, ALL BETS WOULD BE OFF IT IS AT LEAST INEVITABLE, AND MAY WELL BE DESIRABLE, THAT THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD HAVE SOME (WHICH IS NOT TO SAY LIMITLESS) PLAY IN THE JOINTS EVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE GREAT WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS THAT OUR TRADITION CELEBRATES AS LIBERTY'S ULTIMATE SAFEGUARD.
940	WORLD POPULATION IS INCREASING, PARTICULARLY IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. GROUNDWATER RESERVES ARE BEING DEPLETED; LANDS ARE BEING DEGRADED. THE REQUIRED INCREASE IN FOOD PRODUCTION MUST COME PRINCIPALLY FROM NEW SUPPLIES OF WATER FOR IRRIGATED LANDS. IF IRRIGATED LANDS FAIL TO PRODUCE THE REQUIRED FOOD, INCREASED DESTRUCTION OF RESOURCES AND DEGRADATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT FROM INCREASING SLASH AND BURN AGRICULTURE IS ANTICIPATED. VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE FOOD SHORTAGE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS CASE STUDIES AND INCLUDES TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONSIDERATIONS. IN GREECE, IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS WERE LAND CONSOLIDATION, AND THE INCENTIVES PROVIDED ENCOURAGED PRIVATE INITIATIVE. THE CONSTRUCTION OF LARGE DAMS FACILITATED REFORESTATION. IN HAITI, FLOODING AND EROSION RESULTING FROM SLASH AND BURN AGRICULTURE, AND LAND FRAGMENTATION WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. LAND REDISTRIBUTION AND FAILURE OF MAINTENANCE RESULTED IN THE RAPID DETERIORATION AND FAILURE OF THE ONCE PROSPEROUS COLONIAL IRRIGATION SYSTEMS. AGRARIAN REFORM AND/OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COOPERATIVES WITH GOVERNMENT LANDOWNERSHIP PRODUCED A RAPID DECLINE IN IRRIGATED PRODUCTION IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. IN HONDURAS, LITTLE USE HAS BEEN MADE OF 20 COOPERATIVES FINANCED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN AND THE FAO. VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE FINANCED RESOURCE INVENTORIES AND PROJECT STUDIES AND HAVE PROVIDED FUNDS FOR DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT FAVORABLE LAWS AND POLICIES FREQUENTLY HAVE MORE INFLUENCE ON DEVELOPMENT THAN THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. STRENGTH IN THE RULE OF LAW, A FREE MARKET ECONOMY, LOCAL AND USER PARTICIPATION IN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ARE FREQUENTLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE FROM LOANS. SOME SUCCESSFUL TRAINING COURSES ARE DESCRIBED. A WORLD WATER AND CLIMATE ATLAS IS NOW AVAILABLE AND CAN BE USED FOR MANY PLANNING AND RISK EVALUATION PURPOSES.

941	RESEARCHING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES OF LEGAL NIHILISM IN YOUNG PEOPLE IS URGENT NOWADAYS DUE TO THE CONSIDERABLE NEGATIVE EFFECT WHICH THIS PROBLEM HAS ON THE SOCIETY. PREVIOUS STUDIES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSES OF LEGAL NIHILISM OFTEN DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONTEMPORARY THEORETICAL APPROACHES (SUCH AS MORAL FOUNDATIONS THEORY BY J. HAIDT) AND RELIED ON TOOLS WITH UNKNOWN PSYCHOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE CURRENT RESEARCH CHECKED THE HYPOTHESIS OF VALUES-RELATED AND MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF LEGAL NIHILISM IN YOUNG PEOPLE. VALUES WERE DIAGNOSED WITH PVQ-R2 QUESTIONNAIRE (S.SCHWARTZ ET AL.), MORAL SPHERE - WITH MORAL FOUNDATIONS QUESTIONNAIRE MFQ-RU (O.A.SYCHEV ET AL.). IN ORDER TO DIAGNOSE LEGAL NIHILISM, A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS MADE WHICH INCLUDES TWO SCALES CHARACTERIZING DISBELIEF IN THE LAW EITHER AS A GENERALIZED ATTITUDE (IDEOLOGICAL LEGAL NIHILISM) OR DISBELIEF IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES (PRAGMATIC LEGAL NIHILISM). BY THE USE OF THE CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE SEPARATION OF THESE CONSTRUCTS WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF LEGAL NIHILISM (DESPITE THEIR STRONG CORRELATION) WAS JUSTIFIED. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 283 STUDENTS WE ESTABLISHED THAT LEGAL NIHILISM IN ITS DIFFERENT ASPECTS IS SUPPORTED BY THE VALUES OF OPENNESS TO CHANGES, INCLUDING INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT AND CONDUCT, HEDONISM AND SEEKING STIMULATION, WHEREAS IT IS OPPOSED BY THE CONSERVATIVE VALUES, INCLUDING SAFETY, TRADITION AND CONFORMISM. USING STRUCTURED LINEAR MODELING IT WAS SHOWN THAT BELIEF IN THE RULE OF LAW IS SUPPORTED BY AUTONOMY ETHICS WHEREAS TRUST IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM IS SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY ETHICS. THE RESULTS REFINE THE CONCLUSIONS PREVIOUSLY DRAWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL NIHILISM AND VALUES AND ADD TO THE IDEA ABOUT MORALS AS THE BASIS OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
942	HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSPERSONS OR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN MOST OF MODERN COUNTRIES TODAY ARE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED WITH THE AIM OF PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. THEIR JURISDICTION INCLUDES, AS A RULE, PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AS WELL AS THE FUNCTIONING OF THE NATIONAL PREVENTIVE MECHANISMS FOR THE PREVENTION AND THE PREVENTION OF TORTURE AND OTHER CRUEL, INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT. IN ADDITION, THE POWERS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ALSO COVER PROCEDURES TO BE APPLIED IN CASES INVOLVING FREEDOM OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION, AND MINISTERIAL, GOVERNMENTAL AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS. AN IMPORTANT SEGMENT IN FUNCTIONING OF THE OMBUDSMAN IS THE PREVENTION OR ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION. DISCRIMINATION (ORIGINATING FROM THE LATIN WORD DISCRIMINARE: SEPARATE, DISTINGUISH, UNWARRANTED DISCRIMINATION OR UNEQUAL TREATMENT, OR ILLEGAL DISTINCTION) IS A NEGATIVE AND SOCIALLY DANGEROUS PHENOMENON WHICH IN A NUTSHELL MEANS ANY UNEQUAL OR DIFFERENT TREATMENT INCLUDING EVERY EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION OR PREFERENCE BASED ON REAL OR ASSUMED GROUNDS AGAINST ANY PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS, AND THEIR BLOOD RELATIVES OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THEM, ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE, COLOR, LANGUAGE, RELIGION, ETHNICITY, DISABILITY, AGE, NATIONAL OR SOCIAL ORIGIN, POLITICAL OR OTHER OPINION, PROPERTY, MEMBERSHIP IN A TRADE UNION OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATION, EDUCATION, SOCIAL STATUS AND SEX, SEXUAL EXPRESSION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AND ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WITH A PURPOSE OR A CONSEQUENCE TO DISABLE OR ENDANGER RECOGNITION, ENJOYMENT OR EXERCISE ON AN EQUAL BASIS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE. THE METHODS APPLIED IN OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL BODIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF EQUALITY, PRIMARILY THE INSTITUTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSMAN OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN DISCRIMINATION CASES ARE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER.
943	THE UNITED STATES HAS A HIGH STAKE IN CHINA'S SERIOUS FOOD SAFETY PROBLEM, AS FOOD PRODUCTS OF CHINESE ORIGIN HAVE DOMINATED THE U.S. FOOD MARKET IN NUMEROUS AREAS AND CONTINUE TO GROW. THE CONCLUSION OF THE US.-CHINA FOOD SAFETY AGREEMENT ("THE AGREEMENT') HAS ALLOWED FDA TO STRENGTHEN REGULATORY COOPERATION WITH ITS CHINESE COUNTERPART IN VARIOUS ASPECTS. THE AGREEMENT ALSO PAVES THE WAY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW REGULATORY TOOLS INCORPORATED IN FSMA, ESPECIALLY IN THE CROSS-BORDER CONTEXT. HOWEVER, BOTH THE AGREEMENT AND FSMA HAVE CERTAIN CRUCIAL LIMITATIONS THAT MAY CREATE FUTURE HURDLES TO EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE US. CHINA COOPERATION. THIS PAPER THEREFORE ENDEAVORS TO FIRST EXAMINE CHINA'S GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES OVER FOOD SAFETY, WITH A FOCUS ON THE 2009 FOOD SAFETY LAW, THE 2015 AMENDMENT, AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF "THIN" RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER MOVES TO ANALYZE THE US.-CHINA FOOD SAFETY AGREEMENT, REVIEWING THE AGREEMENT'S STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. IT FURTHER ASSESSES FSMA'S INNOVATIVE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN TO REGULATE IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS AND ITS LIMITATIONS. HOWEVER, BOTH THE U.S.-CHINA FOOD SAFETY AGREEMENT AND FSMA ARGUABLY CREATE A REGULATORY DILEMMA FOR FDA WHEN ADDRESSING IMPORTED FOOD SAFETY, DUE TO STRUCTURAL MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BROAD SCOPE OF POWER GRANTED TO FDA AND THE LONG CHAIN OF POWER OUTSOURCING TO GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE COMPANIES AS PRIMARY "REGULATORS." NEITHER THE AGREEMENT NOR FSMA GIVE FDA ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO CLOSELY OVERSEE SUCH "AGENTS" ALONG THE CHAIN OF POWER OUTSOURCING. FRAMING THE U.S.-CHINA FOOD SAFETY COOPERATION AS A MULTILAYER STRUCTURE THAT "OUTSOURCES POWER" TO "IMPORT SAFETY," THIS PAPER CONCLUDES BY STRESSING THE NEED FOR A ROBUST ACCOUNTABILITY AND EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR US. CHINA FOOD SAFETY COOPERATION.
944	CULTURAL PROPERTY POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LAWLESS, FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. IN RECENT YEARS, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS AGGRESSIVELY RESTRICTED THE MOVEMENT OF CULTURAL PROPERTY INTO THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT HAS REPEATEDLY DONE SO WITHOUT REGARD FOR CONSTRAINING LEGAL AUTHORITY. THE RESULT IS A TROUBLING DISJUNCTION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S (THE "EXECUTIVE") CURRENT CULTURAL PROPERTY POLICIES AND THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY CONGRESS AND THE JUDICIARY. WE DOCUMENT THAT DISJUNCTION IN THIS ARTICLE. WE EXPLAIN, FOR EXAMPLE, HOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS RECENTLY REPATRIATED AN EGYPTIAN SARCOPHAGUS AND AN. ANTIQUE FRENCH AUTOMOBILE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN, BUT IT DISREGARDED WELL-ESTABLISHED JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IN THE PROCESS. WE EXPLAIN HOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS SIMILARLY SOUGHT TO REPATRIATE CULTURAL OBJECTS TO ITALY, PERU, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA BY RELYING ON STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT CONGRESS PLAINLY NEVER DESIGNED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE. AND WE EXPLAIN HOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS IMPOSED COMPREHENSIVE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON CULTURAL PROPERTY FROM AROUND THE WORLD WITHOUT SATISFYING ALL OF THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY CONGRESS. IN ADDITION TO DOCUMENTING THIS DISJUNCTION BETWEEN POLICY AND LAW, WE SITUATE IT IN ITS BROADER CONTEXT. WE SUBMIT THAT THE DISJUNCTION REFLECTS AN OUTDATED LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THAT FRAMEWORK IS THE PRODUCT OF THE 1970S, WHEN THE CULTURAL PROPERTY FIELD WAS STILL FORMING, AND IT HAS NOT INCORPORATED THE DRAMATIC POLITICAL AND NORMATIVE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST THREE DECADES. WE FURTHER EXPLAIN HOW THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S WILLINGNESS TO DISREGARD STATUTORY CONSTRAINTS RAISES SERIOUS AND UNRESOLVED SEPARATION OF POWERS CONCERNS. THIS PRECARIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL DYNAMIC UNDERMINES THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND INVITES ARBITRARY POLICYMAKING. WE THEREFORE ARGUE THAT STATUTORY REFORM IS NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THE DISJUNCTION, MODERNIZE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW. WE CONCLUDE BY OFFERING SUGGESTIONS FOR REFORM.
945	SINCE THE BIRTH OF THE MODERN STATE, SCHOLARS HAVE REPEATEDLY ARGUED THAT, AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE IN CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES, THE SOVEREIGN STATE DOES NOT CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE PERSONS. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PARADOX OF THE MODERN STATE, HOWEVER, THAT IT COMMANDS THE POWER TO PROVIDE ORDER AND GENERAL WELFARE FOR SOCIETY BUT THAT IT IS, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT UPON COLLABORATION WITH PRIVATE PERSONS. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE PARADOX BACK TO THE RISE OF THE MODERN SOVEREIGN STATE IN FRANCE AND IN THE GERMAN LANDER (STATES), WHICH VIRTUALLY BANNED CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND PRIVATE PERSONS AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURIES. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE STATE POSSESSED ALL THE POWER NECESSARY TO UNITE SOCIETY; WE CAN SEE THE EMERGENCE OF THE MODERN STATE WHEN THE SOVEREIGN POWER CONSCIOUSLY DECIDES NOT TO UTILIZE CONTRACTS DURING THE PROCESS OF UNIFICATION. BUT WE CAN ALSO OBSERVE THE RE-ENTRY OF THE CONTRACTING STATE BETWEEN 1850 AND 1914 IN FRANCE UNDER THE PRECONDITIONS OF LIBERAL THOUGHT, INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW DOCTRINE TO HOLD THE EVER MORE FLEXIBLE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE (RECOURS POUR DETOURNEMENT DE POUVOIR, APPEAL FOR ABUSE OF POWER). AT THE SAME TIME IN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND, CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND PRIVATE PERSONS WERE STILL LARGELY INEXISTENT AND PARTIALLY SUBSTITUTED BY FISCAL THEORY. SCHOLARS THERE WERE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH MAKING THE STATE AS SUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE, BUT NO INDEPENDENT COURTS POSSESSED THE COMPETENCE TO REVIEW ACTS BY THE NEW INTERVENTIONIST ADMINISTRATION. OBSERVING THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE CONTRACTING STATE AND ITS COURTS, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW FOR A STATE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON COLLABORATION WITH PRIVATE PERSONS.
946	CROATIAN GOVERNMENT ADOPTED THE STRATEGY OF STATE ADMINISTRATION REFORM IN THE PERIOD OF 2008-2011 ON 19TH MARCH 2008. THE STRATEGY DELINEATES EIGHT GOALS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM ACCOMPANIED BY 29 INDICATORS OF PROGRESS. THE GOALS ARE: INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY IN STATE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM; RAISING THE QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES; OPENNESS AND ACCESS TO STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATIONS; THE RULE OF LAW; INCREASING SOCIAL SENSITIVITY INSIDE STATE ADMINISTRATION AND IN RELATIONS WITH CITIZENS; RISING ETHICAL LEVEL AND REDUCING CORRUPTION; MODERN ICT IMPLEMENTATION; JOINING THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE. IN ADDITION, THE STRATEGY IDENTIFIES FIVE MAIN AREAS WITH 15 DIRECTIONS OF REFORM AND DETAILED ACTIVITIES. THE AREAS ARE: STRUCTURAL ADAPTATIONS OF STATE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM: FROM STRUCTURE TO GOOD GOVERNANCE (3 DIRECTIONS; 13 ACTIVITIES); INCREASING THE QUALITY OF PROGRAMMES, LAWS AND OTHER REGULATIONS: BETTER REGULATION (4 DIRECTIONS; 14 ACTIVITIES); SYSTEM OF STATE SERVANTS: MODERN CIVIL SERVICE (4 DIRECTIONS; 10 ACTIVITIES); EDUCATION AND INSERVICE TRAINING OF STATE ADMINISTRATION: KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND COMPETENCIES (2 DIRECTIONS; 8 ACTIVITIES); SIMPLIFICATION AND MODERNISATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES: EADMINISTRATION (2 DIRECTIONS; 17 ACTIVITIES). THERE ARE SEVERAL PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES THAT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED DURING THE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION. THEY ARE: QUALITY PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION OF THE REFORM ACTIVITIES; PROFESSIONALISM AND SUSTAINABILITY OF PAR RESULTS (COULD BE ACHIEVED ON THE BASIS OF MERIT AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EDUCATION); PARTICIPATION OF GENERAL PUBLIC, CIVIL SOCIETY AND CITIZENS IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING REFORM MEASURES; DECENTRALISATION AND PARTNERSHIP; PROTECTION OF CITIZENS RIGHTS. IN THE FINAL PART, THE STRATEGY ASKS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR EVALUATION OF STATE ADMINISTRATION MODERNISATION. THE MEMBERS WILL BE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PARLIAMENT, CIVIL SOCIETY, TRADE UNIONS, STATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES, AND EXPERT COMMUNITY. THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AND DAYTODAY LEADERSHIP IS ASSIGNED TO THE CENTRAL STATE OFFICE FOR ADMINISTRATION.
947	THE PEOPLE OF BURMA/MYANMAR HAVE SUFFERED FOR TWO GENERATIONS UNDER MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS. THEIR ECONOMY, LEGAL AND SOCIAL ORDERS, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND POLITICAL FREEDOMS HAVE ALL STEADILY DECLINED DURING THAT TIME. THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THE WORST WORLD-WIDE. IN THE WEST, RESPONSES HAVE RANGED FROM DIPLOMATIC CONDEMNATION, TO THE IMPOSITION OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS, AND TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF AID AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE BEEN TYPICALLY LESS ROBUST, MORE ACCEPTING OF ASSERTIONS OF SOVEREIGN RIGHTS AND CONCERNED TO PROMOTE ENGAGEMENT AND DIALOGUE RATHER THAN ISOLATION AND PUNISHMENT. NEITHER APPROACH APPEARS TO HAVE HAD ANY DISCERNABLE IMPACT ON THE ATTITUDE OF MYANMAR'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT OR ON THE PLIGHT OF ITS PEOPLE. AUNG SAN SUU KYI REMAINS UNDER HOUSE ARREST, HER PRO-DEMOCRACY PARTY BANNED, AND ITS MEMBERS PERSECUTED; THE RULE OF LAW IS NON EXISTENT, AND THE ONCE FLOURISHING ECONOMY IS IN TERMINAL DECLINE. NEW STRATEGIES TO BREAK THE IMPASSE ARE NOW BEING CONTEMPLATED IN BOTH THE WEST (MORE CONDITIONAL ENGAGEMENT) AND THE EAST (MORE STRIDENT CONDITIONALITY). THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES A CONTROVERSIAL AUSTRALIAN HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVE THAT RAN IN MYANMAR FROM 2000 TO 2003, WHICH MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A FORERUNNER TO THESE NEW "THIRD WAY" APPROACHES. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE OBJECTIVES, NATURE, COMPOSITION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM; IT ASSESSES ITS ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, ITS RISKS AND POTENTIAL, AND EXPLORES SOME OF THE CRITICISMS AND PRAISE THE PROGRAM ENGENDERED. IT ALSO PROVIDES A DETAILED BACKDROP AGAINST WHICH ONE MIGHT DRAW SOME TENTATIVE LESSONS IN TERMS OF THE PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN BOTH THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF MYANMAR, AND ALSO, BY IMPLICATION, IN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY'S APPROACH TO INTRANSIGENT, PARIAH STATES.
948	LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS GENERALLY NEGLECTED THE QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE ANALYTICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS BY COURTS OF LAST RESORT AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS CONCEPT FOR TRADITIONAL DEBATES OVER THE JUDICIAL POWER BETWEEN PROPONENTS OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND ACTIVISM. IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR NOWLIN EXAMINES THESE QUESTIONS AND CONCLUDES THAT CONSTITUTIONS CAN LIMIT COURTS OF LAST RESORT AND, THUS, THAT THE U.S. CONSTITUTION CAN LIMIT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE PURPOSES OF CONSTITUTIONS INCLUDE CREATING AND LIMITING GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS COURTS OF LAST RESORT, AND THE U.S. CONSTITUTION BOTH CREATED AND LIMITS THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL POWER LIKELY EXTEND BEYOND FAMILIAR CONSTRAINTS ON FEDERAL JURISDICTION TO THE USE OF INTERPRETIVE METHODOLOGIES AND THUS ENCOMPASS QUESTIONS OF THE PROPER JUDICIAL ROLE AS ACTIVIST OR RESTRAINED. PROFESSOR NOWLIN FURTHER CONCLUDES THAT THE COURT'S FINALITY OF DECISION IN NO SENSE ENTAILS A SUBSTANTIVE INFALLIBILITY, AND, THEREFORE, THE COURT'S SUPREME SELF-AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ITS OWN DECISIONS DOES NOT FINALLY RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE COURT HAS VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION. PROFESSOR NOWLIN ALSO ELUCIDATES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETIVE AUTHORITY, EXPLAINING IN WHAT MANNER A CONSTITUTION MAY AUTHORIZE AND LIMIT THE INTERPRETIVE AUTHORITY OF INSTITUTIONS INTERNAL TO A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. PROFESSOR NOWLIN ALSO OUTLINES A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING JUDICIAL CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING VIOLATIONS VIA EXCEEDING STRUCTURAL AUTHORITY, CONTRAVENING RULE-OF-LAW NORMS, INVOKING JUDICIAL REVIEW PRETEXTUALLY, AND INFRINGING OTHER SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS. IN SUM, THE CONCEPT OF (UN)CONSTITUTIONALITY IS AS APPLICABLE TO COURTS OF LAST RESORT AS IT IS TO OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS OR ACTORS WITHIN A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADITIONAL DEBATES ABOUT THE JUDICIAL POWER.
949	THE LITERATURE ON CORRUPTION IN COUNTRIES IN THE COURSE OF TRANSITION IS LIKELY TO ESCALATE IN THE LIGHT OF CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE (HOLMES 1997, VARESE 1997). THE 'END OF EMPIRE' IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW. THROUGH A VARIETY OF SUBTERFUGES, BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATE BODIES SEEK TO ENSURE THEIR OWN SURVIVAL, WITHIN THE MATRIX OF THE COLLAPSE OF LEGAL ORDER. IN SOUTH AFRICA, SIMILAR TRANSFORMATIONS, AS EPITOMISED BY THE HEARINGS OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION, HAVE PROVIDED A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO UNVEIL THE MECHANISMS WHICH MAINTAINED THAT APARTHEID REGIME FOR NEARLY HALF A CENTURY. UNDERSTANDING THAT COMPLEX PRACTICE OF STATE DEVIANCE ENTAILS RECOGNISING THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF STATE POWER AND MALPRACTICE IN THAT COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE FLOWS DIRECTLY FROM THE FOUCAULDIAN NOTION OF THE DECENTRALISATION OF POWER IN MODEM SOCIETY. POWER IN THE AUTHORITARIAN STATE IS NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF A CLEARLY-DEFINED STATE APPARATUS. RATHER THAT LOCUS CO-EXISTS WITH VARIOUS SUB-FOCI AT LOWER LEVELS OF STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY, IN WHICH LOCAL INTERACTIONS AND POWER RELATIONS, CONTRIBUTE TO THE TOTALITY OF CONTROL. APARTHEID SURVIVED FOR MANY YEARS NOT BECAUSE IT SIGNIFIED AN AUTHORITARIAN CENTRALISED STATE BUT BECAUSE IT COULD RELY ON INDIVIDUALS AND AGENCIES AT LOWER STRATA OF POWER TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO SUSTAINING THAT ABNORMAL STRUCTURE. DEVIANCE BY STATE PERSONNEL AT DIFFERENT LEVELS - TO WHICH THE NELSON'S EYE WAS TURNED - WAS CRITICAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF WHITE HEGEMONY. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES DIRECTLY ON ONE SUCH NEXUS - THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT INTERESTS - FINANCIAL, ORGANISATIONAL, AND A COMMITMENT TO RACIAL HEGEMONY - COOPERATED IN A SEAMLESS WEB TO ENSURE THAT THE WHITE RULE WAS PARAMOUNT IN MICRO-LEVEL DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURES. MICRO-LEVEL INFLUENCES ON POLICE TRAINING AND OF POLICE PROMOTIONS - DEVIANT BY ANY CONVENTIONAL YARDSTICK-SERVED BOTH STATE AND INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS.
950	MANY OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES IN LAW INVOLVE THE CHOICE BETWEEN RULES AND RULELESSNESS IN CASES WHERE BOTH SEEM UNACCEPTABLE. THE PRINCIPAL GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO POINT THE WAY TOWARD A MORE REFINED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW ONE THAT SEES A DEGREE OF PARTICULARITY, AND A DEGREE OF LAW-MAKING AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION, AS IMPORTANT PARTS OF THAT IDEAL. THE ARTICLE DEFENDS A FORM OF CASUISTRY AND DESCRIBES THE POTENTIALLY DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE CASUISTICAL ENTERPRISE IN LAW. IT BEGINS BY DESCRIBING THE DISTINCTIVE ADVANTAGES OF RULES AND LAW VIA RULES, ESPECIALLY AS A MEANS FOR PROVIDING A CONSENSUS ON WHAT THE LAW IS FROM PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE ON MUCH ELSE. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THREE ATTACKS ON DECISIONS ACCORDING TO RULES: THE VIEW THAT RULES ARE EXCESSIVELY CONSERVATIVE; THE VIEW THAT CONTROVERSIAL POLITICAL AND MORAL CLAIMS ALWAYS PLAY A ROLE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF RULES, AND THUS THAT RULES ARE NOT WHAT THEY APPEAR TO BE; AND THE VIEW THAT RULES ARE OBTUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO CRUDE TO COVER DIVERSE HUMAN AFFAIRS, AND BECAUSE JUDGES SHOULD NOT DECIDE CASES WITHOUT CLOSELY INSPECTING THE DETAILS OF DISPUTES. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS SEVERAL WAYS TO AVOID THE DILEMMAS POSED BY RULES AND RULELESSNESS: (A) A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF PRIVATELY ADAPTABLE RULES THAT IS, RULES THAT ALLOCATE ENTITLEMENTS WITHOUT SPECIFYING OUTCOMES, IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH FREE MARKETS; (B) A RECOGNITION OF LEGITIMATE RULE REVISION, IN WHICH PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE CITIZENS AVE ALLOWED TO SOFTEN THE HARD EDGES OF RULES; AND (C) HIGHLY CONTEXTUALIZED ASSESSMENTS OF THE VIRTUES AND PATHOLOGIES OF BOTH OPTIONS, IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC GOALS OF RESPONSIVENESS AND OPEN PARTICIPATION.
951	ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMME (UNEP), THE WORLD LOSES 1.0 X 106 HM2 FOREST LAND THROUGH DEFORESTATION ANNUALLY. ABOUT 1.6 X 106 PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON FORESTS FOR LIVELIHOOD ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION. THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF FOREST GOVERNANCE, ENFORCEMENT AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS ON DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN WEST BENGAL STATE, INDIA. THE STUDY WAS BASED ON QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY DATA DURING 2020-2021 COLLECTED FROM THREE WESTERN DISTRICTS (PURULIA, BANKURA, AND PASCHIM MEDINIPUR) WHERE DEFORESTATION AND POVERTY RATES ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER DISTRICTS IN WEST BENGAL STATE. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SELECTED VILLAGES WAS 29, AND THE TOTAL SAMPLE HOUSEHOLDS WERE 693. A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA, AND A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FOLLOWED. FOREST GOVERNANCE AND ENFORCEMENT INDICES WERE CONSTRUCTED USING UNITED NATION DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (UNDP) METHODOLOGY AND A STEP-WISE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS AFFECTING DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION. THE RESULT OF THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT FOUR FACTORS (ILLEGAL LOGGING, WEAK FOREST ADMINISTRATION, ENCROACHMENT, AND POVERTY) ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE CAUSES OF DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATION. IT IS OBSERVED THAT SIX INDICES OF FOREST GOVERNANCE (RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, INCLUSIVENESS AND EQUITABILITY, AND EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS) IS RELATIVELY HIGH IN PURULIA DISTRICT. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT PURULIA AND BANKURA DISTRICTS FOLLOW MEDIUM FOREST GOVERNANCE, WHILE PASCHIM MEDINIPUR DISTRICT HAS POOR FOREST GOVERNANCE. THE ENFORCEMENT INDEX IS FOUND TO BE HIGHEST IN PURULIA DISTRICT (0.717) AND LOWEST FOR PASCHIM MEDINIPUR DISTRICT (0.257). FINALLY, WEAK FOREST GOVERNANCE, POOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS, AND WEAK ENFORCEMENT LEAD TO THE DEFORESTATION AND FOREST DEGRADATIONIN THE STUDY AREA. THEREFORE, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD STRENGTHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE FOREST CERTIFICATION SCHEMES TO COMBAT ILLEGAL LOGGING.
952	AS PART OF ITS BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI), CHINA IS INCREASINGLY INVESTING ABROAD AND HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT COUNTRY FOR DEVELOPMENT FINANCING. MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE COUNTRY IS DEFYING THE WESTERN PATH OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GUIDED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE STANDARDS. YET, STUDIES OF THE REAL EXISTING ARTICULATION OF THE BRI ARE LACKING. THROUGH A COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY OF CHINESE LOANS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IN EAST AFRICA (THE STANDARD GAUGE RAILROAD IN KENYA AND THE ETHIOPIA-DJIBOUTI RAILROAD), THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CONSOLIDATED AND MORE SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF WHAT KIND OF GOVERNANCE CHINA IS IN FACT PRACTICING THROUGH THE BRI AND THE REASONS BEHIND WHAT I ARGUE TO BE ITS 'ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE' APPROACH. SPECIFICALLY, IT EXAMINES THE ATTITUDE OF CHINESE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) TOWARD CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CRS) IN LIGHT OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS OF THE CHINESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND HOST GOVERNMENTS. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, THIS PAPER COMPARES THE RAILROADS CHINA HAS FINANCED AND BUILT IN KENYA AND ETHIOPIA AS PART OF THE BRI WITH A FOCUS ON CRS AND THEIR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERING CRS IN THE TWO CASE STUDIES IS THAT CHINA IS NOT FORCING UPON HOST COUNTRIES ANY SPECIFIC TYPE OF GOVERNANCE, BECAUSE ITS APPROACH IS ABOVE ALL ADAPTIVE AND CONFORMS WITH ITS CORE PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-INTERFERENCE. SUCH AN APPROACH, HOWEVER, HAS GENERATED SEVERAL NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES THAT MAY REINFORCE POOR GOVERNANCE STANDARDS AND ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE SUSTAINABILITY AND DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES OF THE BRI. BY LOOKING AT CONCRETE CASES FROM THE GROUND, THIS ARTICLE SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON CHINA'S EMERGING DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM ALONG THE BRI AND ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS RELATED TO CHINA'S RISE AS A GREAT POWER.

953	WHETHER OR NOT THE NOTION OF THE WORLD AS MADE OF CIVILIZATIONS IN VARYING DEGREES OF ALLIANCE OR CONFLICT IS VALID, AND HOWEVER RELIABLE OR UNRELIABLE THE IDEA OF AN 'ISLAMIC WORLD' OR A 'WESTERN WORLD', IT IS AN INDISPUTABLE REALITY THAT THERE ARE HISTORIES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DESCRIBED BY AND PURPORT TO BE 'OF THE WEST' AND 'OF ISLAM'. INDEED, IT IS COMMONPLACE IN DISCOURSE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS TO REFER TO ISLAM AND THE WEST AS DISTINGUISHABLE BY VALUES AND THE 57 NATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE (THE OIC) AND THE 47 NATIONS THAT COMPRISE THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE (COE) PURPORT TO REPRESENT THE VALUES RESPECTIVELY OF ISLAM AND THE WEST. AS USUALLY EXPRESSED, HOWEVER, THE FREQUENTLY USED COMPARATIVE VALUES INDIVIDUALISM, PIETY, LIBERALISM, RULE OF LAW, FAMILY, ABSTEMIOUSNESS AND SO ON ARE, EPISTEMOLOGICALLY, ARGUABLY WORTHLESS. CAN VALUES BE IDENTIFIED FOR ISLAM AND THE WEST THAT PROVIDE AN EPISTEMOLOGICALLY VALID DISTINCTION? WHEN THE OIC AND THE COE ARE ANALYSED BY REFERENCE TO WHAT THEY SAY AND DO, THE ANALYSIS BEING TESTED FOR CONSISTENCY AGAINST THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS, A CASE CAN BE MADE THAT EPISTEMOLOGICALLY USEFUL RESPECTIVE VALUES CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THUS, FOR EACH OF THE PERSON WHO WILL BE REFERRED TO AS 'THE MUSLIM MAN' AND THE PERSON WHO WILL BE REFERRED TO AS 'THE WESTERN MAN', THERE IS DISTINCT DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE. THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF THE MUSLIM MAN EXTOL A VIRTUE OF CONVICTION. THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF THE WESTERN MAN EXTOL A VIRTUE OF DOUBT. FOR THE MUSLIM MAN CONVICTION IS UNCONDITIONAL, FOR THE WESTERN MAN CONVICTION IS CONTINGENT; THE ONE ENJOYS UNCONDITIONAL CERTAINTY, THE LEGACY OF A REVELATION; THE OTHER SUFFERS RESERVATION, THE LEGACY OF AN EXPERIENCE OF ERROR. WHAT FOR ONE IS A VIRTUE, FOR THE OTHER IS A VICE. THEIR RESPECTIVE DISPOSITIONS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
954	PURPOSE - RECENT EMPIRICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FDI IS EXPECTED TO BE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND SOUND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE HOST COUNTRY. WE ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER TO SEE IF GOVERNMENTS IMPLEMENT A MAJOR CHANGE IN INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, WILL THE INSTITUTIONAL REFORM TOWARD BETTER GOVERNANCE HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE EFFECT IN ENHANCING FDI INFLOWS. THIS PAPER THUS AIMS TO ANALYZE THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF FDI INFLOWS IN ASEAN+3 (KOREA, CHINA, JAPAN) COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY - TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ON FDI INFLOWS ACROSS ASEAN+3 COUNTRIES RECORDED BETWEEN 1996-2018, THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) ARE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ON FDI INFLOWS. THE MODEL HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY USING FIXED EFFECTS TO SHOW THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS. FINDINGS - OUR MAIN FINDINGS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE INFLOW OF FDI IN THE ASEAN+3 COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY FOR KOREAN ECONOMY. MOREOVER, GDP GROWTH CONTINUE TO EXERT THEIR POSITIVE INFLUENCE. HOWEVER, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, THOUGH EQUALLY IMPORTANT, ARE INSIGNIFICANT TO ATTRACT FDI INFLOWS. THE KEY FINDING IS THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INWARD FDI IN THE ASEAN+3 COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - EXISTING STUDIES FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL FACTORS ON FDI ACROSS COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER INSTEAD ATTEMPTS TO INVESTIGATE WHICH TYPE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT IN PROMOTING FDI INFLOWS ACROSS ASEAN+3 COUNTRIES, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR MULTINATIONALS TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A FOREIGN SITE AS A POSSIBLE FDI DESTINATION.
955	BACKGROUND: THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA HAS PROVEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT FIGHTING THE WORLD'S MAJOR KILLERS. STRONG GOVERNANCE AND ROBUST DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS ARE NECESSARY, HOWEVER, FOR IMPROVING HEALTH LONG-TERM. WHILE SOME SUGGEST THAT INTERNATIONAL AID CAN STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONS, OTHERS WORRY THAT AID FUNDING WILL UNDERMINE GOVERNANCE, CREATING LONG-TERM HARM. THE GLOBAL FUND IS A UNIQUE AID INSTITUTION WITH MECHANISMS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS ARCHITECTURE IS NOT CLEAR. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY SEEKS EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF FUND FINANCING OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS ON NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT. METHODS: A UNIQUE DATASET FROM 112 LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH DATA FROM 2003 TO 2017 ON GLOBAL FUND FINANCING AND MULTIPLE MEASURES OF HEALTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND GOVERNANCE. BUILDING A SET OF REGRESSION MODELS, WE ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUND FINANCING AND KEY INDICATORS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT, CONTROLLING FOR MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF OTHER AID PROGRAMS AND TESTS FOR REVERSE CAUSALITY. FINDINGS: WE FIND THAT GLOBAL FUND SUPPORT IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL FREEDOMS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW, THOUGH ASSOCIATION WITH EFFECTIVE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IS LESS CLEAR. WE ALSO FIND ASSOCIATED BENEFIT FOR OVERALL ADULT MORTALITY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. CONCLUSION: OUR DATA ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH RECENT CLAIMS THAT AID UNDERMINES GOVERNANCE. INSTEAD OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION THAT THE GLOBAL FUND ARCHITECTURE IS MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUING CRISES OF AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE INSTITUTIONS, FIGHT CORRUPTION, AND SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT. AMIDST THE COMPLEX POLITICAL ECONOMY THAT PRODUCES GOOD GOVERNANCE AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, OUR FINDING OF A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF HEALTH AID SUGGESTS IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR AID IN OTHER SETTINGS.
956	USING FIRM-LEVEL SURVEY RESPONSES FROM 2009 TO 2012, WE EXAMINE WHETHER COMPETITORS FROM THE INFORMAL SECTOR AFFECT THE CREDIT CONSTRAINTS OF REGISTERED SMES IN 86 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN EXACERBATING OR IN ALLEVIATING SUCH EFFECT. A WEAK QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT STRENGTHENS INTER-LINKAGES BETWEEN THE FORMAL AND THE INFORMAL SECTORS, INCREASES THE COSTS AND DECREASES THE BENEFITS ASSUMED BY FORMAL FIRMS, AND REDUCES THE COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO INFORMALITY. MOREOVER, IT ALSO RESULTS IN A LARGE INFORMAL ECONOMY, WHICH INFLUENCES PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE SUBSTITUTABILITY BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL GOODS, AND LAW EVASION. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGISTERED SMES FACING COMPETITION FROM INFORMAL FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CREDIT-CONSTRAINED THAN OTHER FORMAL SMES THAT ARE NOT CONFRONTED WITH SUCH COMPETITION. THIS RESULT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE "PARASITE" VIEW AND THE ENTREPRENEURIAL PERSPECTIVE OF INFORMALITY, WHICH ASSERT THAT INFORMAL FIRMS ARE CAPABLE OF COMPETING AGAINST REGISTERED SMES AND HURTING THE LATTER'S PROFITS. FURTHER, WE FIND THAT SUCH ADVERSE IMPACT MANIFESTS ONLY IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW AND HIGH DEGREE OF CORRUPTION AND BUREAUCRACY. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT REGISTERED MICRO AND SMALL FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF INFORMAL FIRM COMPETITORS THAN MEDIUM-SIZED FIRMS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE BENEFITS OF FORMALITY THAT INCLUDE ACCESS TO CREDIT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCREASE WITH FIRM SIZE. ON THE WHOLE, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENTS MUST ENHANCE THEIR ROLE IN INCREASING ACCESS TO CREDIT TO SMALLER FIRMS AND IN PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR INFORMAL FIRMS TO BE INTEGRATED IN THE FORMAL ECONOMY. MOREOVER, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCLUSIVE GROWTH, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH AFFECTS ALL ENTREPRENEURS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.

957	ARGENTINA IN RECENT YEARS, AS THE PARADIGM OF CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSEQUENT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS HAS ISSUED A SET OF KEY RULES FOR THE EXTENSION OF RIGHTS AND SOCIAL INCLUSION OF SEXUAL MINORITIES WHO LONG HAD BEEN OPPRESSED, NEGLECTED AND SILENCED. THESE STANDARDS HAVE HAD A STRONG IMPACT ON THE ENTIRE ARGENTINE LEGAL SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY IN SEVERAL CLASSIC OR TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF FAMILY LAW, HELPING TO CRYSTALLIZE A MORE JUST AND PLURAL SOCIETY. THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE LEGAL AND SYMBOLIC VALUE THAT HAS BEEN THE LAW 26,618 (2010) FIGURE EXTENDING MARRIAGE TO SAME-SEX COUPLES, BEING THE FIRST LEGISLATION TO THIS EFFECT IN THE REGION. THIS CLEAR VICTORY ACHIEVED BY THE LGBT COMMUNITY WAS NOT THERE, BUT IT WENT TO EXTENSION OF RIGHTS AND IDENTITIES, PUSHING THROUGH THE LAW 26.743 (2012) GENDER IDENTITY ALLOWING TRANSVESTITES AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE TO DEFINE THEIR IDENTITY AS DIRECTED BY THEIR SELF-REFERENTIAL LIFE PLAN, NO OBLIGATION FOR IT TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN INTERVENTION OF SEX REASSIGNMENT. FINALLY, WE ANALYZE THE LAW 26,862 (2013) OF EQUAL ACCESS TO THE COVERAGE OF ASSISTED HUMAN REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, LEGISLATION WHICH PLACES ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUES IN A WAY TO SATISFY THE RIGHT TO FORM A FAMILY ON THE BASIS OF PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION, AND NOT AS WELL THE NEED TO ALLEVIATE A DISEASE AS IT WOULD BE INFERTILITY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN ARGENTINE LAW HOMOPARENTALITY TALK? THIS IS WHAT IS INVESTIGATED IN THIS PAPER IN THE LIGHT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE PROJECT OF REFORM OF THE CIVIL CODE DRAFT CIVIL CODE REFORM CURRENTLY IN TREATMENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS WHICH INTRODUCES IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS IN THE SUBSIDIARY REGIME. IN SHORT, IT AIMS TO SHARE THE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES WHICH OBSERVES ARGENTINE LAW WHEN PLURAL IDENTITIES AND FAMILIES CONCERNED.
958	EUROPEAN CHRISTIANS AND ESPECIALLY CATHOLICS HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE BIRTH, DEVELOPMENT AND LIFE OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS THAT EMERGED IN THE WAKE OF THE WORLD WAR II AND THAT WERE BASED ON CHRISTIAN AND HUMANISTIC VALUES, DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE RULE OF LAW - THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, EUROPEAN UNION AND ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE. THIS INITIAL ROLE OF CHRISTIANS, TOGETHER WITH THE CATHARTIC SPIRIT OF THE TIMES, NATURALLY INSPIRED THE NEED AND MAINTAINED THE PERMANENCY - AT FIRST INFORMALLY AND LATER ON MORE OBLIGATORY - OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN RELIGION AND THE "COMMUNITIES OF BELIEF" WITH THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS. IN PROCESSES OF POLITICAL INTEGRATION IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, THIS DIALOGUE IS CONDUCTED NOT ONLY WITH THE NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS, BUT ALSO WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF VALUES, HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIAL ACHIEVEMENTS. CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE DIALOGUE WAS FIRST CONDUCTED INFORMALLY, THANKS TO THE DEDICATED CHRISTIANS IN THE EU INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, FOUR YEARS AGO IT ALSO ASSUMED AN OBLIGATORY ROLE WITHIN THE EU INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS AN INSTITUTIONAL CONFIRMATION IN THE EU TREATY. IN THIS REGULAR, OPEN AND TRANSPARENT DIALOGUE WHICH IS CONDUCTED AT SEVERAL LEVELS AND DEALS WITH A WIDE SPECTRUM OF ISSUES, THE CATHOLIC SIDE IS PRIMARILY REPRESENTED BY THE COORDINATION OF BISHOPS' CONFERENCES OF MEMBER COUNTRIES, EU - COMECE. HOWEVER, OTHER RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES AND "COMMUNITIES OF BELIEF" ALSO TAKE PART IN IT. IN THIS WAY THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE VALUE CRITERIA AND THE SPIRITUAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES WHEN FORMULATING AND IMPLEMENTING POLICIES OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THESE POLICIES, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY, ARE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO ALL THE MEMBER COUNTRIES AND TO THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
959	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE PROMINENCE THAT THREATS OF FORCE HAVE HAD IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL LIFE SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, AND HOW WE TEND TO OVERLOOK THESE THREATS IN FAVOUR OF THE ACTUAL USES OF FORCE. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 678 OF NOVEMBER 1990 IS ONE SUCH EXAMPLE. EMBLEMATIC OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS NEW WORLD ORDER, IT IS OFTEN INVOKED FOR THE 'AUTHORISATION' IT GAVE TO MEMBER STATES OF THE UNITED NATIONS 'CO-OPERATING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF KUWAIT. TO USE ALL NECESSARY MEANS TO UPHOLD AND IMPLEMENT RESOLUTION 660 (1990) AND ALL SUBSEQUENT RESOLUTIONS AND TO RESTORE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE AREA' - BUT THIS PROVISION WAS MADE CONTINGENT UPON WHETHER 'IRAQ ON OR BEFORE 15 JANUARY 1991 FULLY IMPLEMENTS [PREVIOUS] RESOLUTIONS'. WE EXAMINE THE RANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THREATS OF FORCE HAVE ARISEN AND FIND THAT THESE GO BEYOND THE ARCHETYPAL 'CLOSE ENCOUNTER' BETWEEN STATES - SUCH AS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS OF 1962 AND THE 'THREATS OF FORCE' DIRECTED AGAINST IRAQ PRIOR TO OPERATION DESERT FOX (1998) AND OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM (2003). MAKING USE OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE FROM ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS ADVISORY OPINION (1996), WE ADVANCE THE IDEA OF A PROHIBITION OF THE APPLICATION OF FORCE, AND CONSIDER THE LOGISTICS OF ITS OPERATION IN STATE PRACTICE; FIRST, IN THE RECENT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND IRAN AND, THEN, THROUGH A MODERN REPRISE OF THE FACTS OF THE CORFU CHANNEL CASE OF APRIL 1949. WE ALLUDE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE BEHIND THIS PROHIBITION, CONSTANTLY REFLECTING UPON THE INTRICACIES OF STATE RELATIONS IN WHICH THIS PROVISION OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER SEEKS TO MAKE ITS MARK.
960	ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) OF 1969, ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS ARE NOW INCORPORATED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OF COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE VIEWED WITH AMBIVALENCE BY SOME DEVELOPING COUNTRY GOVERNMENTS, WHICH SEE THEM AT BEST AS A NUISANCE, AND AT WORST AS A BARRIER TO PROGRESS. FOR CITIZENS IN THESE COUNTRIES, HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND THEIR RIGOROUS JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT MAY PROVIDE THE ONLY MECHANISM AVAILABLE TO HOLD GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR DECISIONS ON MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE LEGAL BATTLE OVER ONE SUCH PROJECT, THE CHALILLO DAM IN BELIZE. PLANS BY A CANADIAN-OWNED UTILITY TO BUILD THE HYDROELECTRIC FACILITY ON BELIZE'S MACAL RIVER SPARKED A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEBATE AND CULMINATED IN THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUIT TO REACH THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL IN LONDON, THE HIGHEST COURT OF APPEAL FOR BELIZE. BELIZEAN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARGUED, INTER ALIA, THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) FOR THE DAM WAS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED, CONTAINING ERRORS IN THE GEOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE DAM'S FOUNDATION. IN AN UNUSUALLY DIVIDED 3-2 RULING, THE PRIVY COUNCIL UPHELD BELIZE'S DECISION TO ALLOW CONSTRUCTION OF THE DAM. THE MAJORITY JUDGMENT DISCOUNTED THE GEOLOGICAL FLAWS IN THE EIA, RULING THAT THE DECISION TO BUILD THE DAM WAS ESSENTIALLY A SOVEREIGN ONE FOR BELIZE TO MAKE. THE DISSENT, MEANWHILE, MAINTAINED THAT THE GEOLOGICAL FLAWS COULD NOT BE IGNORED, AND THAT BELIZEAN AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS THOSE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. TO DO ANY LESS, THE DISSENT REASONED, WOULD UNDERMINE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE CASE ITSELF, AS WELL AS ITS AFTERMATH, DEMONSTRATE THE WISDOM OF THE MINORITY VIEW.
961	NATION-WIDE REFERENDUM ACT IS THE MEAN BY WHICH CITIZENS MAY EXERT DIRECT INFLUENCE ON SPECIFIED STATE ISSUES. HENCE, IT IS OF A KEY IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE OFFENCES SPECIFIED IN THE NATION-WIDE REFERENDUM ACT. THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF FOUR TYPES OF OFFENCES ENUMERATED IN THE ACT: (1) ILLEGAL COLLECTION OF SIGNATURES OF SUPPORT FOR A MOTION OF A GROUP OF CITIZENS BEING SUBMITTED TO THE SEJM ON A NATION-WIDE REFERENDUM (ARTICLE 83 OF THE ACT); (2) ILLEGAL PUBLICATION OF THE RESULTS OF OPINION POLLS ON PROBABLE REFERENDUM RESULTS FROM THE END OF THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF (ARTICLE 85 OF THE ACT); (3) VIOLATION OF THE BAN ON ORGANISING LOTTERIES IN THE COURSE OF REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN (ARTICLE 86 OF THE ACT) AND (4) VIOLATION OF A BAN ON SERVING AND SUPPLY OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DURING SUCH CAMPAIGN (ARTICLE 87 OF THE ACT). WHEN DESCRIBING EACH OF THE OFFENCES, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE SUBJECT OF PROTECTION, THE CONTENT OF AN OFFENCE, THE PERPETRATOR OF AN OFFENCE, AND THE SANCTIONS WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED FOR VIOLATORS. HE POINTS OUT INAPPROPRIATE WORDING OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR AMENDMENT OF BOTH THE ACT AND THE PENAL CODE (IN PARTICULAR ITS ARTICLE 248(6)). HE STRESSED THE LEGITIMACY OF GENERAL PENALISATION OF ELECTORAL OFFENCES, BUT ALSO PROPOSES THE ADOPTION OF ELECTORAL CODE TO REPLACE CURRENTLY EXISTING PROVISIONS. SUCH A CODE COULD CONTAIN (IN ITS GENERAL PART) PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE HOLDING OF ALL TYPES OF ELECTIONS AND REFERENDUMS IN POLAND, AS WELL AS PENAL PROVISIONS, AND (AS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS) NECESSARY DISTINCTIONS RELATED TO PARTICULAR NATURE OF PARLIAMENTARY, PRESIDENTIAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS AND ALSO DIFFERENT KINDS OF REFERENDUMS.
962	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES RECENT STATE AND INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE REGARDING AMNESTIES FOR JUS COGENS CRIMES, PARTICULARLY CASES FROM LATIN AMERICA AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, AND EXPLORES THE TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN COURTS, AND TO A LESSER DEGREE, LEGISLATURES, THAT HAS LED TO INTERNATIONAL NORM CREATION IN THIS AREA, STRENGTHENING THE PROHIBITION AGAINST AMNESTIES CONSIDERABLY. AT THE SAME TIME, CONSTRAINTS UPON THE EXERCISE OF UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION, WHETHER IMPOSED BY LEGISLATURES, ARTICULATED IN JUDICIAL OPINIONS, OR CREATED BY INTERNATIONAL TREATY, HAVE PROVIDED A POLITICAL CHECK TO THE OTHERWISE UNBOUNDED EXERCISE OF UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION BY STATES AND THE EXERCISE OF UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTION BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TAKEN AS A WHOLE. INDEED, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE QUESTION OF AMNESTIES FOR WAR CRIMES, CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND GENOCIDE RAISES PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE AND FORM OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW-ITS SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT, TEMPORAL DIMENSIONS, AND CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT "SWAPPING JUSTICE FOR PEACE," IS MORALLY AND PRACTICALLY ACCEPTABLE. INSTEAD, WHAT LONGITUDINAL STUDIES WE HAVE SUGGEST THAT AMNESTY DEALS TYPICALLY FOSTER A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY IN WHICH VIOLENCE BECOMES THE NORM, RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS AMNESTIES FROM A JURISDICTIONAL APPROACH, IN WHICH DOMESTIC, TRANSNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AMNESTIES ARE CONSIDERED IN BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PERSPECTIVE. FINALLY, WHILE NOTING THAT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS NOT A "ONE SIZE FITS ALL" PROPOSITION, AND THAT CAREFULLY TAILORED AND CULTURALLY SENSITIVE APPROACHES SUITABLE TO INDIVIDUAL CASES ARE REQUIRED, THIS ARTICLE UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EMERGING NORMATIVE AND LEGAL STRUCTURE APPARENT IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR IMPERIAL POWERS SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES TO SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO THE RULE OF LAW IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE LEGITIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULES.
963	THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A PRINCIPAL-AGENT ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR DECISIONS MADE BY A NON-DEMOCRATIC PLANNING BODY UNDER PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THE CENTRAL IDEA IS THAT DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF THE PRINCIPAL (CITIZENS), WHOSE OBJECTIVE IS TO MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE LAND IN HONG KONG, AND THE AGENT (PLANNING APPROVAL AUTHORITY), WHOSE CONCERN IS ABOUT APPROVAL RISK, WHICH IS THE AGENT'S RISK OF BEING ACCUSED OF COLLUSION OR EVEN BRIBERY. THIS PRINCIPAL-AGENT ANALYSIS CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY PUBLIC-SECTOR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN A SOCIETY WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH. IT WAS FOUND BY A LOGIT ANALYSIS OF 1440 SETS OF DISAGGREGATE DATA THAT PLANNING APPLICATIONS BY NON-PROFIT APPLICANTS FOR USES IN GOVERNMENT/INSTITUTION/COMMUNITY (GIC) ZONES WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE APPROVED THAN THOSE BY FOR-PROFIT PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, IN LINE WITH THE IDEA OF A LOWER PERCEIVED APPROVAL RISK. AMONGST THE APPLICATIONS BY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, PROPOSED HIGH-VALUE LAND USES WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE APPROVED THAN THOSE PROPOSED FOR LOW-VALUE USES, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE FORMER RESULTS IN POTENTIALLY HIGHER ECONOMIC GAIN FOR THE APPLICANTS. THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN JULY 2005 HAS ALLOWED A WIDER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PLANNING APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS POLICY CHANGE WAS USED IN THIS STUDY AS A TEST CONDITION FOR THE EFFECT ON PLANNING APPROVALS OF AN INCREASE IN THE PRINCIPAL'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE POLICY CHANGE DID INCREASE THE SUCCESS RATE OF PLANNING APPLICATIONS MADE BY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, THOUGH THE IMPACT WAS MAINLY ON THE APPLICATIONS FOR LOW-VALUE LAND USES ONLY. THE EMPIRICAL RESULT SHOWS THAT THE PERCEIVED APPROVAL RISK FOR HIGH-VALUE LAND USES WAS TOO HIGH TO BE AFFECTED BY THE POLICY CHANGE.
964	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE ROLE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT AND INSTITUTIONS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH (MEASURED BY PER CAPITA GDP) IN FRANCOPHONE AFRICA USING THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHICH IS LIKELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HIGH SHARE OF WOODY BIOMASS IN THESE COUNTRIES. FOR ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT, THE CORRELATION IS POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, WHICH LINKS ECONOMIC GROWTH TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE POSITIVELY RELATED BUT DO NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THE INSIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IMPLIES THAT INSTITUTIONS IN FRANCOPHONE AFRICAN COUNTRIES ARE UNDER-DEVELOPED. THUS, STRENGTHENING THE FORMS OF INSTITUTIONS WILL PROMOTE GROWTH IN THESE COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE CONTRIBUTES TO THE VIEW THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH NOT ONLY EMERGES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION BUT THAT IT CAN BE IMPROVED WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ROBUST INSTITUTIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT POLICYMAKERS DEVELOP POLICIES THAT RAISE GROWTH WITH A FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE POLICIES INCLUDE INCORPORATING POLLUTION TAXES TO DISCOURAGE FOREIGN COMPANIES FROM POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENCOURAGING RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION THROUGH PUBLIC INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN FISCAL AND FINANCIAL POLICIES (INCLUDING CARBON TAXES, GRANTS AND INCENTIVES). LIKEWISE, POLICIES THAT FACILITATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES WITH FREE OR LOW-COST INSTALLATIONS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL AID AFRICA IN ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING THE SHARE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AS FORESEEN UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS SDG 7.
965	THE SOLICITOR GENERAL ("SG") IS OFTEN CALLED THE "TENTH JUSTICE," A TITLE THAT CAPTURES HIS UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND HIS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. NO PHENOMENON BETTER REFLECTS THIS RELATIONSHIP THAN THE COURT'S PRACTICE OF PERMITTING AMICI TO PARTICIPATE IN ORAL ARGUMENT. ALTHOUGH AMICUS ORAL ARGUMENT IS NOMINALLY AVAILABLE TO ALL LITIGANTS, THE MODERN COURT GRANTS THIS PRIVILEGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO THE SG. SCHOLARS AND COURT WATCHERS HAVE LONG ARGUED THAT THIS PRACTICE IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE SG USES IT TO PURSUE THE RULE OF LAW AND AN OBJECTIVE SENSE OF "JUSTICE." THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THAT ACCOUNT. THE SG'S DOMINANCE OF AMICUS ORAL ARGUMENT IS A RELATIVELY RECENT PHENOMENON. IN THE EARLY 1900S, THE SG REQUESTED AMICUS ORAL ARGUMENT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO DEFEND FEDERAL STATUTES OR FEDERAL AGENCY ACTION. DURING THIS TIME, THE COURT GRANTED ALL HIS AMICUS ORAL ARGUMENT REQUESTS. BUT, OVER TIME, SGS INCREASINGLY ENTERED POLITICAL CASES WITH ONLY TENUOUS CONNECTIONS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DURING THE LATE 1980S, THE COURT BECAME SKEPTICAL OF THE SG'S POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE; IN RESPONSE, IT DENIED SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF HIS AMICUS ORAL ARGUMENT MOTIONS, AND INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES CRITICIZED HIM IN INTERNAL MEMORANDA. THIRTY YEARS LATER, THE COURT PERMITS THE SG TO ARGUE AS AN AMICUS IN ALMOST ANY CASE HE WANTS, EVEN THOUGH HE INCREASINGLY WEIGHS IN ON POLITICALLY CHARGED CASES WITH DE MINIMIS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS NEW EQUILIBRIUM HAS PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES. BY PERMITTING THE SG TO BE HEARD ANY TIME HE ASKS, THE COURT SYSTEMATICALLY BIASES THE PERSPECTIVES THAT IT HEARS. THIS BIAS UNDERMINES DUE PROCESS PRINCIPLES AND THE ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM, AND IT IGNORES THE COURT'S OWN HISTORY AND RULES. WE OFFER A PROPOSAL FOR REFORM.
966	CHINA IS UNDERGOING AN ENERGY REVOLUTION BY PURSUING A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY AND A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN ITS ENERGY STRUCTURE. THE PLAN IS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY TO BE 50% OF CHINA'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY 2050 AND TO DECREASE CARBON INTENSITY 60-65% BY 2030 FROM THE 2005 LEVEL. THIS ENERGY REVOLUTION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR ENERGY SECURITY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA. THE ENERGY REVOLUTION REFLECTS THE REQUIREMENT OF A LOW-CARBON ECONOMY AND CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER, CURTAILED RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EXPANDING FOSSIL ENERGY CONSTITUTE A PARADOX IN THIS ENERGY REVOLUTION. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS PROGRESSED IN ITS DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, THIS PARADOX HINDERS RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM CHALLENGING THE DOMINANCE OF FOSSIL ENERGY IN THE SHORT TERM. NOTABLY, AN ENERGY REVOLUTION CAN BE CONSIDERED A PROCESS OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL TRANSITION THAT REQUIRES THE CO-EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND TECHNICAL FACTORS. USING THE MULTI-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK, IT IS UNCOVERED THAT THIS PARADOX RESULTS MAINLY FROM SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES AT THE MACRO AND MESO LEVEL, RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS AT THE MICRO LEVEL. THE ENERGY TRILEMMA, INTEREST DIVERGENCE, AND WEAK SUPERVISION ARE THE MAIN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING WHETHER THE PRIORITY OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CAN BE SECURED. LIMITING THE EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IMPROPERLY AND ELIMINATING TRADITIONAL FOSSIL ENERGY ARBITRARILY ARE TWO UNDESIRABLE EXTREMES. PROPER MECHANISMS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION PROCESS WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE INERTIA AND IMPORTANCE OF THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY INDUSTRY. THE MEASURES SHOULD INCLUDE THE COORDINATION OF INTERESTS DURING ENERGY TRANSITION, THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ENERGY SECTOR, THE FULL LIFE-CYCLE CLEAN PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND THE PHASING OUT OF UNREASONABLE FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIES.
967	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS ANALYZE THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW ASPECTS OF THE CHANGES IN LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AS A FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATOR WITHIN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT, BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA LEGAL ACTS IN THE SYSTEM OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA LEGAL, NORMATIVE, LAW-ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETIVE (ACTS OF INTERPRETATION) AND THE CONTRACTUAL ACTS OF BANK OF RUSSIA. THERE IS AN INFLUENCE OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA PROGRAM LEGAL ACTS ON STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET, MAINTAINING A PROPER LEVEL OF LAW AND ORDER, AND CREATING A TRUSTED FINANCIAL SERVICES ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING DIGITAL FORMS. THE RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS THE LAW-FORMING FUNCTION OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA PROGRAM LEGAL ACTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONCEPTUAL NATURE OF NORMATIVE, LAW-ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATIVE, AND CONTRACTUAL ACTS OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA. THE AUTHOR EMPHASIZES THE STRATEGIC NATURE OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA PROGRAM LEGAL ACTS, WHICH ARE PROPOSED TO BE CONSIDERED AS STRATEGIC PLANNING ACTS. IN ORDER TO FILL THE GAP IN LEGAL REGULATION, IT IS PROPOSED TO AFFIRM THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA TO ISSUE PROGRAM LEGAL ACTS IN THE FIELD OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE FIELD OF ENSURING FINANCIAL ACCESSIBILITY AND IMPROVING CONSUMERS' FINANCIAL LITERACY, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED BY THE BANK OF RUSSIA ON AN INITIATIVE BASIS. THE ARTICLE PROVES THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BANK OF RUSSIA REGULATIONS CAN BE ISSUED NOT ONLY IN THE SPHERE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, BUT ALSO IN PRIVATE SPHERE. THE AUTHORS USED DIALECTICAL, FORMAL-LEGAL, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, AS WELL AS INDUCTIVE METHODS OF STUDYING THE CHANGES IN LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE ECONOMY DIGITIZATION.
968	DURING THE LAST DECADES THE MAP OF EUROPE HAS CHANGED CONSIDERABLY. NEW CLAIMS FOR INDEPENDENT STATEHOOD WERE BROUGHT FORWARD AND DEMANDED FOR RECOGNITION. THESE CLAIMS HAD TO BE ANSWERED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES. THIS ARTICLE EVOLVES AROUND THE IDEA THAT STATE RECOGNITION IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF POLITICS AS IT IS OF LAW. IT STARTS FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT 'WHO WE ARE DEFINES WHAT WE SEE', CLAIMING, THAT EUROPEAN IDENTITY, THE IMAGES THE EU AND THE MEMBER STATES HOLD ABOUT THEMSELVES, SHAPE THE MENTAL MAPS THEY HOLD OF TERRITORIES AND SPACE. BUILDING ON THIS IDENTITY A GEOPOLITICAL IMAGINARY IS FORMED, WHICH CAN BE DEFINED AS IDEAS, ALLOWING ACTORS TO ASCRIBE MEANING TO TERRITORIES, ESTABLISH ORDER IN A SEEMINGLY CHAOTIC WORLD BY MEANS OF CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORISATION AND ALLOW TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR ACTION. THE GEOPOLITICAL IMAGINARY OF EUROPE CONTAINS THE VISION, THAT IF ALL STATES WERE MORE LIKE EUROPE ITSELF, THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE: A WORLD DETERMINED NOT BY POWER AND COERCION, BUT BY RULES, NORMS AND VALUES; WITH CONFLICT MECHANISMS, NOT BASED ON THE RULE OF THE STRONGEST, BUT THE RULE OF LAW; STABILITY, CREATED THROUGH COMMON RULES, NEGOTIATION AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY; AND A DETERMINATION NOT TO LET 'BLUNT POWER-POLITICS' PREVAIL. THIS IMAGINARY SHAPES THE WAY IN WHICH EUROPE MAKES MEANING OF CLAIMS FOR STATEHOOD AND DECIDES WHICH CLAIMS TO RECOGNISE AS LEGITIMATE. THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE IMAGINARY SOMETIMES CONTRADICT EACH OTHER: LAW MAY HAVE TO TAKE THE BACK SEAT IN THE QUEST FOR STABILITY OR JUSTICE. LAW IS OPEN TO CREATIVE INTERPRETATIONS TO ALLOW THE 'RIGHT' CLAIMS FOR RECOGNITION TO PREVAIL AND THE 'WRONG' ONES TO BE REJECTED THE TOOL OF RECOGNITION IS CAUGHT BETWEEN LEGAL ARGUMENTS AND POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS, BETWEEN NORMATIVE VISIONS AND PRAGMATIC POSSIBILITIES.
969	IN THIS ARTICLE TITLED "LAW APPLICABLE IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION", DIFFERENT LEGAL RULES TO BE APPLIED TO THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF ARBITRATION ARE DISCUSSED. THE LEGAL CAPACITY TO MAKE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE ELIGIBILITY TO ARBITRATION IN TERMS OF SUBJECT MATTER AND LAW TO BE APPLIED TO THE FORM OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ARE AMONGST THOSE SUBJECTS THAT WILL BE EXAMINED. THE CAPACITY IS SUBJECT TO THE NATIONAL LAW OF PARTIES AND THE ELIGIBILITY TO ARBITRATION IN TERMS OF SUBJECT MATTER IS SUBJECT TO THE LAW OF COUNTRY IN WHICH THE AWARD WILL BE RECOGNISED AND EXECUTED. THEN THE LAW TO BE APPLIED TO THE BASE WILL BE DETERMINED ACCORDING TO WHETHER THE PARTIES MADE A CHOICE OF LAW. IF THE PARTIES HAVE NOT CHOSEN A LAW, THE ARBITRATORS CAN DETERMINE THE APPLICABLE LAW ACCORDING TO VARIOUS RULES. THESE RULES WOULD BE A CONFLICT OF LAW RULES OF LEX ARBITRI OR THE PROPER LAW OF CONTRACT. LEX MERCATORIA IS THE MOST APPLIED ONE AMONG THESE RULES. THE WILL OF THE PARTIES TO RESOLVE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW OR ACCORDING TO THE USAGE AND PRACTICE IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE ARBITRATORS TO APPLY LEX MERCATORIA. UNLIKE THE LAW TO BE APPLIED TO THE BASE, THE LAW TO BE APPLIED TO THE PROCEDURE IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO THE PLACE OF ARBITRATION LAW. IT WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATORS IF THE PARTIES DID NOT CHOOSE A LAW. THE WILL OF THE PARTIES MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE. IN THE CASE THAT THE PARTIES DIDN'T CHOOSE THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE PROCEDURE, THE ARBITRATOR OR ARBITRATORS CAN APPLY ANY PROPER LAW OF CONTRACT INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE LIKE ICC.
970	DESPITE AN APPARENT CONSENSUS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUALITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THERE IS NO AGREEMENT AMONG RESEARCHERS ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE IT. WHILE DICHOTOMOUS CODING OF DE JURE INDEPENDENCE HAS SERVED AS A PROXY TO MEASURE WHETHER AN AGENCY'S REGULATORY GOVERNANCE IS TRANSPARENT, NON-ARBITRARY, AND FREE FROM POLITICAL INFLUENCE, WE VIEW MEASURING MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF REGULATORY GOVERNANCE INCLUDING INCORPORATING MEASURES OF REGULATORY INDEPENDENCE INTO A COMPOSITE INDEX AS PROVIDING A MORE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF FACILITATING OR INHIBITING FACTORS. THIS PAPER COMPARES COMPOSITE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY INDEPENDENCE INDICES AND REGULATORY GOVERNANCE INDICES AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT MORE PARSIMONIOUS INDICES. USING A METHODOLOGY LABELED "QUALITATIVE META-SYNTHESIS" BASED ON SYNTHESIZING PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED INDICES, WE CONSTRUCT SIX DIFFERENT INDICES USING COMBINATIONS OF 32 DIFFERENT VARIABLES, AND DIFFERENT WEIGHTS. DATA FROM THE OECD DATABASE ARE USED TO RE-CREATE THE FIVE ORIGINAL INDICES FROM THE LITERATURE AS WELL AS OUR OWN SIX COMPOSITES. SOME OF THESE INDICES (ORIGINAL AND COMPOSITES) WERE FOUND TO BE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH INDEPENDENT MEASURES OF REGULATORY GOVERNANCE SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK'S GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INDEX AND THE RULE OF LAW INDEX; THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT COUNTRIES, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH POOR OVERALL GOVERNANCE STANDARDS, MAY NEED TO PUT IN PLACE STRONGER TELECOMMUNICATIONS GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT TELECOMMUNICATIONS INVESTMENT TO THE COUNTRY. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT A PARSIMONIOUS INDEX OF AS FEW AS SEVEN VARIABLES IS CAPABLE OF MEASURING THE QUALITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS GOVERNANCE IN A COUNTRY, AT THE SAME TIME MAKING THE SELECTION OF VARIABLES AND THEIR WEIGHTING IN THE INDEX MORE SYSTEMATIC THAN IN PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE INDICES.

971	AS TIMES GO BY, SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FACES NEW CHALLENGES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF URBAN IMAGE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY AND THE METHODS OF INFORMATION COLLECTION AND PROCESSING FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, AND EXPLAINS THE NECESSITY OF CREATING IMAGE SURVEILLANCE. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IN COUNTRIES WHERE URBAN IMAGE SURVEILLANCE HAS BEEN APPLIED EARLIER AND WITH MORE ADVANCED LEGAL SYSTEMS AT HOME AND ABROAD, FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE IMAGE SURVEILLANCE LEGAL SYSTEM, THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS, AND THE PROTECTION OF COMMUNICATION DATA. EXPLAIN THE LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, AND PUT FORWARD THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM, THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC INTEREST, THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF INFORMATION SECURITY. FINALLY, I PUT FORWARD A POINT OF VIEW ON HOW TO FORMULATE A LEGAL AND FAIR LEGAL SYSTEM. IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE FIELD OF LEGISLATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO SEEK CONSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, USE CIVIL LAW TO REGULATE, USE PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION LAW TO REGULATE, AND USE URBAN IMAGE MONITORING SYSTEM LEGISLATION TO MANAGE. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A "PEER-TO-PEER TREE" ARCHITECTURE OF A TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTED INDEXING SERVICE SYSTEM BASED ON SERVICE TYPES. ITS JOINING AND LEAVING ALGORITHMS CREATE AND MAINTAIN THE FRAMEWORK, CASCADING ORGANIZATIONS RELATED TO SERVICE INTERESTS INTO A TREE STRUCTURE. LEARNING THE NEIGHBOR SEARCH ALGORITHM CAN SLOWLY EVOLVE THE PEER LAYER COMPOSED OF MANY CASCADED TREES INTO AN OVERLAY NETWORK WITH SMALL-WORLD CHARACTERISTICS, THEREBY ENSURING A HIGHER SEARCH EFFICIENCY. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THROUGH FUNCTIONAL TESTING AND PERFORMANCE TESTING, IT IS FOUND THAT WHEN THE NUMBER OF SUPERNODES IS 200, THE SUCCESS RATE IS THE HIGHEST.
972	THE PAPER PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF FIVE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES (WB COUNTRIES: SERBIA, MONTENEGRO, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, NORTHERN MACEDONIA AND ALBANIA) IN THE PERIOD 2006-2016. IT WAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN MODEL OF QUANTIFICATION CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE IN A DELAYED PHASE OF TRANSITION AND AT SOME STAGE IN THE EU ACCESSION PROCESS. ACHIEVING HIGH AND STABLE RATES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR WB COUNTRIES BECOMES THE ULTIMATE PREREQUISITE FOR COMPLETING THE EU TRANSITION AND ACCESSION PROCESS. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE GROWTH DYNAMICS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY KEY DRIVERS OF GROWTH AND TO MODEL APPROPRIATE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES BASED ON THE RESULTS OBTAINED. IN THE PAPER, WB COUNTRIES WERE VIEWED AS A WHOLE. BY EMPIRICALLY TESTING THE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUAL QUALITY INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, ACCORDING TO THE WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS METHODOLOGY BY USING PANEL DATA MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS, THE LARGEST STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT CAME FROM THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY VARIABLE. THE INTENSITY OF THE IMPACT OF THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW VARIABLE ON GDP PER CAPITA IS SLIGHTLY WEAKER, BUT IT IS ALSO VERY PRONOUNCED. IN THIS RESPECT, THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS OBTAINED CAN BE A USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR MODELING THE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES OF WB COUNTRIES. THEY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT GUIDE FOR POLICY MAKERS TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND AT THE SAME TIME MODELING ECONOMIC GROWTH POLICIES.

973	THE PUBLIC INTEREST IMMUNITY (PII) DOCTRINE EMPOWERS THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPRESS INFORMATION, THE DISCLOSURE OF WHICH WOULD INJURE THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. HOWEVER, WHEN SUCH INFORMATION IS RELEVANT TO THE FAIR ADJUDICATION OF LEGAL RIGHTS, A TENSION ARISES BETWEEN TWO COMPETING ASPECTS OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST: THE INTEREST OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. THIS TENSION RAISES QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE. WHO SHOULD DECIDE WHICH ASPECT OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST MUST WIN? HOW SHOULD THAT DECISION BE MADE? THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS. IN THE FIRST SECTION, IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE COURTS, AS OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT, SHOULD HAVE THE FINAL WORD ON THE VALIDITY OF PII CLAIMS, AS IT WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW TO PREVENT THEM FROM MEANINGFULLY REVIEWING THE VALIDITY OF PII CLAIMS AND CONTROLLING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THEIR GREATER INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY, JUDGES ARE BETTER PLACED THAN PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO FAIRLY ADJUDICATE PII CLAIMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDINGS. NO CLASSES OF GOVERNMENT SECRETS, NOT EVEN CABINET SECRETS, SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM JUDICIAL REVIEW. WHILE THERE IS A CONSENSUS ON THESE PRINCIPLES UNDER THE COMMON LAW, THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE AFFORDED TO CABINET IMMUNITY CLAIMS, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE CLAIMS ARE ASSESSED, IS NOT CONSISTENT IN THE COMMONWEALTH. TO FIX THIS SHORTCOMING, IN THE SECOND SECTION, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COURTS SHOULD ADOPT A NEW RATIONAL APPROACH CONSISTING OF FOUR PILLARS: A NARROW STANDARD OF DISCOVERY, AN EXECUTIVE ONUS OF JUSTIFICATION, A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, AND A JUDICIAL DUTY TO MINIMIZE INJURY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A RATIONAL APPROACH WOULD BOLSTER PREDICTABILITY, CERTAINTY, AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE JUDICIAL ASSESSMENT OF CABINET IMMUNITY CLAIMS, AND FOSTER A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND JUSTICE.
974	OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS EXPERIENCED A STUNNING 65 % DECLINE IN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION. WHILE POLITICIANS SEEM UNAWARE OF THIS CHANGE, FIRMS THAT ONCE RELIED ON LOCAL UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS A LOW-WAGE LABOR FORCE FEEL IT ACUTELY. SUCH COMPANIES HAVE INCREASINGLY APPLIED TO SPONSOR TEMPORARY MIGRANTS FROM ABROAD (SOMETIMES CALLED "GUEST WORKERS") TO FILL EMPTY JOBS. IN 2015, THE NUMBER OF MIGRANT WORKERS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES ON VISAS WAS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF UNDOCUMENTED ARRIVALS-ALMOST THE INVERSE OF JUST 10 YEARS EARLIER. YET NOTICE OF THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT, AND EXAMINATION OF ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. LAW AND THE REGULATION OF EMPLOYMENT IN PARTICULAR, HAS BEEN ABSENT FROM LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. THIS ARTICLE FILLS THAT GAP, ARGUING THAT EMPLOYERS' RECRUITMENT OF WOULD-BE MIGRANTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, UNLIKE THEIR USE OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ALREADY IN THE UNITED STATES, CREATES A TRANSNATIONAL NETWORK OF LABOR INTERMEDIARIES-THE "HUMAN SUPPLY CHAIN"-WHOSE OPERATION UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WORKPLACE, BENEFITTING U.S. COMPANIES BY REDUCING LABOR COSTS WHILE CREATING DISTRIBUTIONAL HARMS FOR U.S. WORKERS, AND PLACING TEMPORARY MIGRANT WORKERS IN SITUATIONS OF SEVERE SUBORDINATION. IT IDENTIFIES THE HUMAN SUPPLY CHAIN AS A KEY STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, A CLOSE ANALOG TO THE MORE FAMILIAR PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAINS THROUGH WHICH U.S. COMPANIES MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS ABROAD. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS A STARK GOVERNANCE DEFICIT WITH REGARD TO HUMAN SUPPLY CHAINS, ANALYZING THE CAUSES AND HARMFUL EFFECTS OF AN EFFECTIVELY UNREGULATED WORLD MARKET FOR HUMAN LABOR. DRAWING ON THE AUTHOR'S ORIGINAL RESEARCH INTO INNOVATIVE PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID APPROACHES TO THE GOVERNANCE OF HUMAN SUPPLY CHAINS, THE ARTICLE SETS OUT AND EVALUATES A RANGE OF POTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS, ULTIMATELY PROPOSING A NEW SUPPLY CHAIN LIABILITY THAT REALIGNS RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARMS THAT ATTEND THE GLOBAL RECRUITMENT OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS.
975	BACKGROUND: CORRUPTION IN THE HEALTH SECTOR CAN HURT HEALTH OUTCOMES. IMPROVING GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN IN TURN HELP PREVENT HEALTH-RELATED CORRUPTION. WE UNDERSTAND GOOD GOVERNANCE AS HAVING THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS: IT IS CONSENSUS-ORIENTED, ACCOUNTABLE, TRANSPARENT, RESPONSIVE, EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT, FOLLOWS THE RULE OF LAW, IS PARTICIPATORY AND SHOULD IN THEORY BE LESS VULNERABLE TO CORRUPTION. BY FOCUSING ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL SYSTEM, WE EXPLORE SOME OF THE KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM EXISTING INITIATIVES IN GOOD GOVERNANCE. AS THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY BEGINS TO IDENTIFY POST-2015 MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS TARGETS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO EVALUATE PROGRAMS IN GOOD GOVERNANCE IN ORDER TO BUILD ON THESE RESULTS AND ESTABLISH SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES. THIS DISCUSSION ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL SYSTEM ILLUMINATES WHY. DISCUSSION: CONSIDERING PHARMACEUTICAL GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES SUCH AS THOSE LAUNCHED BY THE WORLD BANK, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND THE GLOBAL FUND, WE ARGUE THAT COUNTRY OWNERSHIP OF GOOD GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES IS ESSENTIAL BUT ALSO ANY INITIATIVE MUST INCLUDE THE PARTICIPATION OF IMPARTIAL STAKEHOLDERS. UNDERSTANDING THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF ANY INITIATIVE IS ALSO VITAL SO THAT POTENTIAL OBSTACLES ARE IDENTIFIED AND THE DESIGN OF ANY INITIATIVE IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN PROGRAMMING AS NEEDED. FINALLY, THE INHERENT CHALLENGE WHICH ALL INITIATIVES FACE IS ADEQUATELY MEASURING OUTCOMES FROM ANY EFFORT. HOWEVER IN FAIRNESS, DETERMINING THE PRECISE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS RARELY STRAIGHTFORWARD. SUMMARY: CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED IN PHARMACEUTICAL GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES MANIFEST IN DIFFERENT FORMS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE INITIATIVE, BUT THEIR REGULAR OCCURRENCE AND IMPACT ON POPULATION-BASED HEALTH DEMONSTRATES GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING PHARMACEUTICAL GOVERNANCE AS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE POST-2015 MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, THESE CHALLENGES NEED TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND RESPONDED TO WITH GLOBAL COOPERATION AND INNOVATION TO ESTABLISH LOCALIZED AND EVIDENCE-BASED METRICS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE TO PROMOTE GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL SAFETY.
976	THE DECADE SINCE 9/11 HAS SEEN THREE PHASES IN THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF DETAINEE POLICY IN THE "WAR ON TERRORISM." FIRST, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPTED TO CREATE A "LAW-FREE ZONE" IN WHICH IT COULD DEAL WITH SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FREE OF LEGAL RESTRAINT OR INTERFERENCE BY THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AFTER EVERY REBUFF BY THE SUPREME COURT THE ADMINISTRATION RESPONDED BY SEEKING THE "LEAST-LAW ALTERNATIVE" AND TO THAT END INVENTED NEW FORMS OF ADJUDICATION: MILITARY COMMISSIONS AS SUBSTITUTES FOR CRIMINAL TRIALS, SUMMARY MILITARY TRIBUNALS TO AUTHORIZE INDEFINITE DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE, AND SHORT-CUT ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL HABEAS PROCEDURES. IN THE SECOND PHASE, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD ITS STATED GOAL OF RETURNING TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARENA IN PARTICULAR, BY ANNOUNCING THE CLOSURE OF GUANTANAMO, THE END OF THE MILITARY COMMISSION SYSTEM, AND A COMMITMENT TO USING THE FEDERAL COURTS TO PROSECUTE TERRORISTS. THE THIRD PHASE BEGAN ROUGHLY WITH THE RETURN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO REPUBLICAN CONTROL IN THE 2010 ELECTIONS. CONGRESS EMPLOYED ITS APPROPRIATIONS POWER TO LIMIT AND THEN TO FORECLOSE THE PRESIDENT'S ABILITY TO TRANSFER DETAINEES FROM GUANTANAMO, THUS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLOSE THE CONTROVERSIAL DETENTION CENTER OR TO PROSECUTE DETAINEES HELD THERE IN FEDERAL COURT, AND FORCING MILITARY COMMISSIONS TO RESUME. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, THE D.C. CIRCUIT ISSUED A SERIES OF DECISIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY REVERSED THE SUPREME COURT'S HABEAS DECISIONS OF 2004 AND 2008. THE SUPREME COURT'S FAILURE TO REVIEW THESE DECISIONS HAS LEFT DETAINEES WITH ESSENTIALLY NO MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO WIN RELEASE. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S OFTEN SURPRISINGLY EFFECTIVE RESPONSES, AND WHERE DETAINEE POLICY IS LIKELY TO GO NEXT.
977	THE PURPOSE OF ARISTOTLE'S DISCUSSION OF POLITICAL JUSTICE IN EN V.6-7 HAS BEEN A MATTER OF DISPUTE. ALTHOUGH THE NOTION OF POLITICAL JUSTICE WHICH ARISTOTLE SEEKS TO ELUCIDATE IS RELATIVELY CLEAR, NAMELY THE NOTION OF JUSTICE WHICH OBTAINS BETWEEN FREE AND EQUAL CITIZENS LIVING WITHIN A COMMUNITY AIMING AT SELF-SUFFICIENCY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, CONFUSION ARISES WHEN ONE ASKS HOW POLITICAL JUSTICE RELATES TO THE OTHER KINDS OF JUSTICE EXAMINED IN EN V. IS POLITICAL JUSTICE A HIGHLY DETERMINATE SUBDIVISION OF JUSTICE WHICH ARISTOTLE EXAMINES ALONGSIDE THE OTHER VARIETIES OF PARTICULAR JUSTICE ANALYZED IN EN V.2-5? OR IS POLITICAL JUSTICE RELATED TO THE ANALYSIS OF ETHICAL AGENCY WHICH FOLLOWS IN EN V.8-11? THE QUESTION IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE PASSAGE IN QUESTION - EN V 1134A17-1135A15 - HAS OCCASIONED MUCH SPECULATION ABOUT TEXTUAL DISLOCATIONS AND HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO CHAPTER DIVISIONS DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THE TWO PREVALENT MODERN EDITORIAL DIVISIONS OF THE ETHICS. TO RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, I ARGUE THAT ARISTOTLE'S ACCOUNT OF POLITICAL JUSTICE IS SITUATED WITHIN AIL EXTENDED APORETIC ANALYSIS WHICH BEGINS IN EN V.6 AND EXTENDS THROUGH EN V.8. ARISTOTLE INTRODUCES THE NOTION OF POLITICAL JUSTICE WITHIN THE EXTENDED ANALYSIS CONCERNING THE ASCRIPTION OF CHARACTER STATES BECAUSE CALLING SOMEONE JUST OR UNJUST PRESUPPOSES THAT THE PERSON IS A FULLY MATURE ETHICAL AGENT, BUT ANYONE CAPABLE OF POLITICAL JUSTICE POSSESSES SUCH AGENCY. ONCE THE EXTENDED ARGUMENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF EN V IS PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD, IT APPEARS THAT THE RECEIVED TEXT IS NOT IN NEED OF EMENDATION. TO FURTHER SUPPORT MY CLAIM THAT ARISTOTLE'S ACCOUNT OF POLITICAL JUSTICE INTRODUCES A NEW INQUIRY WHICH IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO THE ANALYSES OF PARTICULAR JUSTICE IN THE FIRST HALF OF EN V, I COMPARE POLITICAL JUSTICE TO THE OTHER SPECIES OF JUSTICE.
978	IN CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, IT IS INCREASINGLY COMMON THAT IN MANY COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD AND EUROPE, POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLES ARE CALLING FOR AN INALIENABLE RIGHT TO THE EXTERNAL SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLES INVOLVING SECESSION TO TRY TO ACHIEVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND AUTONOMY, FORMING THEIR NATIONAL STATES TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALREADY EXISTING COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY LIVING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY CAUSE DESTABILIZATION AND WARS IN MANY COMPLEX MULTIETHNIC STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. THEREFORE, THE & ANGS;LAND ISLANDS AND QUEBEC CASES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR TODAY'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE IN CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, IN PARTICULAR AS THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE HAGUE AND THE DOMESTIC COURTS INVOKE THEM AS PRECEDENTS TO ADDRESS ALL FUTURE CASES OF REFERENCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO EXTERNAL SELF-DETERMINATION INVOLVING SECESSION. BASED ON THOSE CASES, IT HAS DEVELOPED THAT THE ISSUE OF SECESSION IS THE QUESTION OF THE INTERNAL LEGAL ORDER OF EACH SOVEREIGN COUNTRY, WHICH SHOULD DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE THROUGH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL ORDER, AND CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW SHOULD DEAL WITH ITS CONSEQUENCES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE AND OFFER ANSWERS THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT POSSIBLE ABUSES OF THE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION OF ALL PEOPLES AS A COLLECTIVE HUMAN RIGHT IN CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW. SUCH UNLAWFUL CONDUCT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES, IN PARTICULAR, THE VIOLATION OF BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLES OF TERRITORIALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES, THE DISTORTION OF WORLD PEACE AND ORDER, ECONOMIC PROGRESS, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PURSUIT OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AS WELL AS OTHER COLLECTIVE HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY BE THE CAUSE OF PROVOCATION AND LEAD TO INTERNATIONAL AND CIVIL WARS.
979	FORMS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING, FOR EXAMPLE COLONISATION, APARTHEID AND FORMS OF RADICAL SOCIALISM (UJAMAA - SOCIALISM IN TANZANIA, AND RADICAL LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE), PROVED TO BE MOSTLY FAILURES WITH CATASTROPHIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE VARIOUS STATES, THEIR ECONOMIES AND EVEN THE SOCIETIES INVOLVED. OFTEN THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT EXACTLY HAD BEEN ENVISAGED, WAS ACHIEVED. IN THIS REGARD, THE FAILURE OF APARTHEID (SOMETIMES DESCRIBED AS SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT) IS STILL FRESHLY REMEMBERED AS A PERTINENT EXAMPLE OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED INSTANCES OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING. PROCEEDING FROM THE IDEA (OR IDEOLOGY) OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION (NDR), THE OVERARCHING POLICY FRAMEWORK OF POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION HAS SINCE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SOUTH AFRICA - THE RESPONSE TO THE FORMER APARTHEID AND COLONIAL PRACTICES PRECEDING THE COUNTRY'S CHANGE TO A DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN 1994. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE IDEOLOGY INFORMING NDR POLICIES IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOCIETY THAT STRIVES TO BECOME RECONCILING, NON-SEXIST AND AIMED AT DEVELOPMENT IN A RADICAL TRANSFORMATIVE WAY. THE CENTRAL FOCUS IS REPRESENTATIVITY AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING THE STATE, THE ECONOMY AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THIS RESEARCH STATES AS HYPOTHESIS THAT POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION (TRANSFORMATIONISM) THE IDEOLOGY CURRENTLY PREVALENT IN SOUTH AFRICA, IS DOOMED TO FAILURE AND THAT THIS FAILURE IS NOT ONLY ALREADY OBSERVABLE, BUT HOLDS FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE, THE ECONOMY AND GREATER SOCIETY IN FUTURE. MY AIM IS TO UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION AS THE OVERARCHING POLITICAL IDEOLOGY IN SOUTH AFRICA. SUCH EVALUATION IS UNDERTAKEN IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW ADAGE ("RECHTSSTAAT" NOTION) AS NORM, AS WELL AS CONNECTED DEMOCRATIC CRITERIA ACCORDING TO WHICH POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FREEDOM ARE TAKEN AS NORMATIVE BASIS AND POINT OF DEPARTURE.
980	THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE JUDICIAL CONTROL OF THE ACTS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS UNDERGONE IN THE CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY IS THE SUBJECT PUT IN DEBATE. IT IS INTENDED FROM A SIMPLE HOMAGE TO THE CAPITAL WORK OF PROFESSOR SERGIO DE ANDREA FERREIRA "THE CONTROL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BY THE JUDICIARY" TO VERIFY TO WHAT EXTENT THE RISE OF A NEW THEORETICAL-INSTITUTIONAL MODELING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION IN THE LIGHT OF THE PROMOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS DOES NOT CAN IMPORT INTO UNDUE NARROWING OF THE LEGITIMATE SPACE OF ADMINISTRATIVE MERIT. IN ORDER TO DO SO, THE WORK IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS, INVESTIGATING THE LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE MERIT IN THE LIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, THE EXPANSION OF CONTROL AND RISE OF THE JUDICIARY WITH THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1988 AND THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION IN PROMOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, BUT IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE MERIT WHILE IRRADIATING THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. THE DIALECTICAL CRITICISM IS ADOPTED BY METHODOLOGY WITH A PRIMARY PURPOSE IN THE LEGAL LITERATURE OF THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FOREIGN. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT UNDER THE AEGIS OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW, IT IS NOT FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL GOODS AND VALUES, FOR THE EMPTYING OF THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE AND ITS IRRADIATION BY THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS DENSIFICATION IN ADMINISTRATIVE MERIT. ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS CLEAR THAT UNDER THE AEGIS OF A PLURALISTIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, WHICH CONSECRATES MULTIPLE AND VARIED INTERESTS, IT IS INCUMBENT ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SHARING NOT TO THE JUDICIARY, BUT ON THE STATE ADMINISTRATION TO PROMOTE THE REALIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER PENALTY OF OWN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE.
981	TWENTY YEARS AGO, LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS LOBBIED TO REQUIRE DATA AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES TO ENGINEER THEIR PRODUCTS TO GUARANTEE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS TO ALL DATA. AFTER LENGTHY DEBATE AND VIGOROUS PREDICTIONS OF ENFORCEMENT CHANNELS "GOING DARK," THESE ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES ON THE EMERGING INTERNET WERE ABANDONED. IN THE INTERVENING YEARS, INNOVATION ON THE INTERNET FLOURISHED, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOUND NEW AND MORE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING VASTLY LARGER QUANTITIES OF DATA. TODAY, THERE ARE AGAIN CALLS FOR REGULATION TO MANDATE THE PROVISION OF EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS MECHANISMS. IN THIS ARTICLE, A GROUP OF COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND SECURITY EXPERTS, MANY OF WHOM PARTICIPATED IN A 1997 STUDY OF THESE SAME TOPICS, HAS CONVENED TO EXPLORE THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF IMPOSING EXTRAORDINARY ACCESS MANDATES. WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE DAMAGE THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE EVEN GREATER TODAY THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 20 YEARS AGO. IN THE WAKE OF THE GROWING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COST OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INSECURITY OF TODAY'S INTERNET ENVIRONMENT, ANY PROPOSALS THAT ALTER THE SECURITY DYNAMICS ONLINE SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH CAUTION. EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS WOULD FORCE INTERNET SYSTEM DEVELOPERS TO REVERSE "FORWARD SECRECY" DESIGN PRACTICES THAT SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON USER PRIVACY WHEN SYSTEMS ARE BREACHED. THE COMPLEXITY OF TODAY'S INTERNET ENVIRONMENT, WITH MILLIONS OF APPS AND GLOBALLY CONNECTED SERVICES, MEANS THAT NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS ARE LIKELY TO INTRODUCE UNANTICIPATED, HARD TO DETECT SECURITY FLAWS. BEYOND THESE AND OTHER TECHNICAL VULNERABILITIES, THE PROSPECT OF GLOBALLY DEPLOYED EXCEPTIONAL ACCESS SYSTEMS RAISES DIFFICULT PROBLEMS ABOUT HOW SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE GOVERNED AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT SUCH SYSTEMS WOULD RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
982	BACKGROUND SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE RATES ARE THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSIONS OF VIOLENCE. THE RATES ARE GLOBALLY ALMOST DISTRIBUTED MIRROR-REVERTED. RICH, MODERN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES WITH A FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM HAVE HIGH SUICIDE AND LOW HOMICIDE RATES, TRADITIONAL STATES WITH A WEAK CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HIGH HOMICIDE AND LOW SUICIDE RATES. EXCEPTIONS ARE SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, IN WHICH BOTH, THE RATES OF HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE ARE VERY HIGH. THESE STATES ARE LOCATED ON THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER BLOODLANDS (SNYDER, BLOODLANDS: EUROPA ZWISCHEN HITLER UND STALIN, 2011), WHERE BETWEEN 1930 AND 1945 14 MILLION PEOPLE WERE CIVILIAN VICTIMS OF THE SOVIETS AND THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS. WE ADDRESSED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THESE EIGHT COUNTRIES (POLAND, LITHUANIA, ESTONIA, LATVIA, MOLDOVA, BELARUS, RUSSIA AND UKRAINE) DIFFER FROM THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER EAST BLOC, FROM THE ASIAN COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER USSR AND THE WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS. METHODS THE DATA USED FOR ANALYSES WERE TAKEN OF VARIOUS DATA SETS FROM THE WHO, THE UN AND THE CIA. THE STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE FOUR REGIONS WAS CARRIED OUT BY NONPARAMETRIC TESTS. RESULTS THE STATES ON THE GROUNDS OF THE FORMER BLOODLANDS AND THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER EAST BLOC ARE COMPARABLE CONCERNING IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PARAMETERS SUCH AS LEVEL OF MODERNIZATION, DEMOCRACY-INDEX AND RULE OF LAW-INDEX. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND ONLY IN THE ANNUAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA AND THE DIVORCE RATES. CONCLUSIONS WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE HIGH SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE RATES IN SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF EXTREME VIOLENCE OF NEARLY THE ENTIRE POPULATION BETWEEN 1930 AND 1945. POSSIBLE PATHS OF THE TRANSGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS CONCEIVABLE CHAINS OF CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE TRAUMA IN THE FIRST GENERATION AND SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL BEHAVIOR IN THE FOLLOWING GENERATIONS ARE PRESENTED.
983	THE ULTIMATE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO STUDY AND DISCUSS A CENTRAL DILEMMA WITHIN INSPECTION OF ANIMAL WELFARE. ON THE ONE HAND, IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT CONTROLLERS SHOULD CHECK ONLY WHETHER FARMERS COMPLY OR NOT WITH ANIMAL WELFARE REGULATION. HERE, THE KEY VALUE IS THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT ALL OFFENDERS SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF INSPECTIONS IS TO ENTER INTO DIALOGUE WITH FARMERS. THIS MAY BE BASED ON A MORE FORWARD-LOOKING VIEW AIMED AT MOTIVATING FARMERS TO LOOK AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE ANIMALS IN THEIR CARE. IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AUTHORITIES TRY TO ENFORCE ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION THROUGH INSPECTIONS FOLLOWED UP BY PENALTIES IN INSTANCES WHERE A LACK OF COMPLIANCE IS FOUND. HOWEVER, THE FAIRNESS AND EFFICIENCY, AND ULTIMATELY THE PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THE SYSTEM, CRITICALLY DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL INSPECTOR. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN INTERVIEW-STUDY INTO HOW DANISH ANIMAL WELFARE INSPECTORS VIEW THEIR OWN ROLE AND TASKS. IN THE MAIN RESULTS, A THEME OF DISAGREEMENT PRESENTED ITSELF AND REVEALED DIFFERENT ATTITUDES IN TERMS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGAGING IN A DIALOGUE WITH THE FARMERS. THE FIRST THEME FOCUSED ON THE PREVENTIVE ASPECT. THE SECOND HAD ITS FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE AND ON THE AVOIDANCE OF ENGAGING IN DIALOGUE WITH THE FARMER REGARDING THE REASONS FOR THE REGULATIONS. MOREOVER, A THEME OF AGREEMENT SHOWED INTERPRETATION AS UNAVOIDABLE. WE DISCUSS HOW THE POINTS OF VIEW OR STRATEGIES OF THE INSPECTORS MAY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF ANIMAL WELFARE INSPECTIONS, BOTH ON A SHORT-AND LONG-TERM BASIS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS STUDY CAN INITIATE A NECESSARY AND MORE OPEN DISCUSSION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DILEMMA.
984	IN THE PRESENT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO REEXAMINE ATTENTIVELY THE THEORIES THAT HAVE FOUNDED THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF CITIZENSHIP AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO SCRUTINIZE THE RELATION THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN OTHERNESS AND MODERN NATIONAL IDENTITY. I INTEND TO DO THIS BY RESORTING TO KANT'S WRITINGS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY, AND PARTICULARLY HIS POLITICAL PROJECT FOR A PERPETUAL PEACE, IN WHICH HE ATTEMPTS TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE ANCIEN REGIME AND OF THE PRE-MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE NATION IN ORDER TO OUTLINE THE MODERN PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE THREE LEVELS OF RIGHT: OF THE RECHTSSTAAT (A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW); OF THE VOLKERRECHT (THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT); AND OF THE SO-CALLED WELTBURGERRECHT (THE ''COSMOPOLITICAL RIGHT''). THE DECISIVE AND PERHAPS DISTURBING IDEA THAT HAS TO BE DEMONSTRATED IS THAT, IN KANT'S MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION BETWEEN NATIONALISM AND COSMOPOLITISM. ANY INTERPRETATION OF HIS THOUGHT THAT NEGLECTS THIS POINT WOULD LEAD TO A MISUNDERSTANDING OF KANT'S PHILOSOPHICAL REVOLUTION AND FALL BACK INTO THE POLITICAL AS WELL AS THE METAPHYSICAL ANCIEN REGIME. WE HAVE TO SHOW: (1) THAT KANT'S CRITIQUE OF REASON AIMS TO ESTABLISH A LEGISLATION IN THE SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGE ITSELF AND THAT IT MUST THEREFORE ACCOMPLISH IN THIS SPHERE A ''REVOLUTION'' THAT DISTINGUISHES - IN OPPOSITION TO METAPHYSICAL UNIVERSALISM - DIFFERENT TERRITORIES WITH THEIR OWN CONSTITUTION AND LEGISLATION; (2) THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS THEORETICAL ''REVOLUTION'' AND THE POLITICAL ONE IS NOT ONLY A METAPHOR, AND THAT KANT'S REJECTION OF THE POLITICAL ANCIEN REGIME CANNOT BE CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD IF IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE LEGITIMACY OF THE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES OF REASON.
985	TO WHAT EXTENT HAS THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, AND THE AUGMENTED USE OF HEALTH SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS RESULTED FROM IT, ALTERED INTERNATIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, PRIVACY, AND DEMOCRACY? THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW GLOBAL PATTERNS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. IN CHINA, THE OUTBREAK HAS STRENGTHENED A PRE-EXISTING TECHNO-AUTHORITARIAN PROJECT AIMED AT PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF THREATS TO BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC ORDER. CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM SUCH AS CHINA'S MAJOR POWER STATUS, ITS GLOBAL ECONOMIC ROLE, AND ITS LEADERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUGGEST THAT CHINA'S MODEL OF ILLIBERAL PANDEMIC RESPONSE COULD DIFFUSE WORLDWIDE. OTHER FACTORS, HOWEVER-SUCH AS THE INCOMPARABILITY OF CHINA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM-SUGGEST MORE LIMITED DIFFUSION POTENTIAL. TO DATE, THE PANDEMIC HAS LARGELY AUGMENTED EXISTING TRENDS, MEANING THAT AUTOCRACIES HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO RESPOND IN WAYS THAT INFRINGE UPON CITIZEN RIGHTS, AND WEAK DEMOCRACIES HAVE EXHIBITED SOME RISK OF DEMOCRATIC EROSION AND PANDEMIC-ASSOCIATED AUTOCRATIZATION. IN THESE CASES, HOWEVER, FACTORS OTHER THAN SURVEILLANCE HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIC DECAY. CONVERSELY, A LARGE NUMBER OF CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES HAVE EMPLOYED SURVEILLANCE, BUT HAVE MANAGED TO NAVIGATE THE INITIAL STAGES OF CRISIS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISING DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS. IN THESE CASES, SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN FENCED IN BY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND RULE OF LAW, AND NORMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND PUBLIC OPINION HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO FACILITATE PANDEMIC RESPONSES THAT ARE (ON BALANCE) PROPORTIONAL, LIMITED IN TIME AND SCOPE, AND SUBJECT TO DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS MAY NEED TO SEPARATE THE PANDEMIC'S EFFECTS ON DEMOCRACY FROM ITS EFFECTS ON LIBERALISM, AND THAT CARE MUST BE TAKEN TO IDENTIFY THE PRECISE MECHANISMS THAT LINK PANDEMIC RESPONSE TO VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
986	FOR ANTON VLADIMIROVICH KARTASHEV (1875-1960), 1917 WAS A YEAR OF UNEXPECTED POLITICAL RISE AND TRAGIC FALL. DOCENT OF THE ST. PETERSBURG THEOLOGICAL ACADEMY, KARTASHEV BECAME POPULAR IN LIBERAL CIRCLES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIETY FOR RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY; HE WAS APPOINTED AN ASSOCIATE (DEPUTY) TO THE OBER-PROCURATOR OF THE HOLY SYNOD IN MARCH 1917. ABOUT THE NEED FOR CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE, KARTASHEV DID SEE EYE TO EYE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE CADET (CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC) PARTY LEADERS. HE WAS A SUPPORTER OF 'SYMPHONY' BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE, RESTORATION OF PATRIARCHATE AND CONCILIAR ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH. IN SUMMER AFTER JOINING THE CADET PARTY, KARTASHEV BECAME OBER-PROCURATOR, ALTHOUGH HIS FUNCTIONS WERE SOON ABSORBED BY THE MINISTRY OF RELIGIOUS CONFESSIONS. AS A MINISTER, HE WELCOMED THE ALL-RUSSIAN SOBOR IN AUGUST 1917, ASSERTING THE NEED FOR INDEPENDENT CONCILIAR CHURCH IN 'FRIENDLY CULTURAL COOPERATION' WITH RULE-OF-LAW STATE. KARTASHEV PARTICIPATED IN THE MOSCOW STATE CONFERENCE AND COUNTENANCED THE AFFAIR OF GENERAL L. G. KORNILOV. IN SEPTEMBER, KARTASHEV RESIGNED AS MINISTER TO PROTEST AGAINST THE SOCIALIST STRANGLEHOLD IN THE GOVERNMENT. THE RESIGNATION WAS NOT ACCEPTED, AND AT THE NIGHT OF 25 OCTOBER HE WAS ARRESTED, ALONG WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. LETTERS PUBLISHED HERE, ARE ADRESSED TO M. A. PETRUNKEVICH, S. V. PANINA, AND M. F. KOKOSHKINA; ALL WRITTEN BY A. V. KARTASHEV DURING HIS IMPRISONMENT IN THE PETER AND PAUL FORTRESS. CORRESPONDENCE OF THE EX-MINISTER CONTAINS HIS ASSESSMENTS OF PAST EVENTS AND RECORDS HIS MOODS, BORN FROM AN ESCHATOLOGICAL PERCEPTION OF THE DEVELOPMENTS IN RUSSIA. IN ONE OF HIS LETTERS, KARTASHEV EXPLORED THE ISSUES OF HUMAN NATURE AND FLESH, MALE AND FEMALE PRINCIPLES, AND CONDITIONS FOR THEIR EQUALITY BEFORE GOD; THE LETTER ALSO OUTLINED WAYS AND MEANS OF REVIVING RUSSIA AFTER THE REVOLUTION.
987	IN ARTICLE AN ATTEMPT TO GIVE AN ASSESSMENT TO INTERACTION OF GOVERNORS AND BODIES OF CITY SELF-GOVERNMENT IN SIBERIA IN 1870-1917, TO DISCLOSE NATURE OF THE CONFLICTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND METHODS OF THEIR PERMISSION IS MADE. ACTIVITIES OF PRESENCE FOR CITY AFFAIRS AS PROVINCIAL SUPERVISION BODIES ARE RESEARCHED. A KEY TASK OF PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATIONS - SUPERVISION OF RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW BY CITY MANAGEMENTS AND CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS OF THE POPULATION TO THEIR ACTIONS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN CHIEFS OF PROVINCES AND THE CITIES ON QUESTIONS ARE ANALYZED: ELECTIONS, FINANCING OF POLICE, DISTRIBUTION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, ETC. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IN THE CERTAIN CITIES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PRESSURE AS A CONFLICT RESOLUTION METHOD WAS APPLIED. TWO PERIODS OF STRENGTHENING OF SUPERVISION OF THE CITIES ARE ALLOCATED: 18931896 (AT LOCAL ELECTIONS) AND 1905-1908 (ON REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS). GOVERNORS AND THE CITY AUTHORITIES SOMETIMES HARDLY FOUND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COORDINATION OF THE MEASURES. IN DESPERATE SITUATIONS BOTH PARTIES HAD THE RIGHT TO APPEAL DIRECTLY IN THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTRY - THE RULING SENATE. BECAUSE OF CONGESTION UNCOUNTABLE CLAIMS OF BOTH THE STATE AND PUBLIC INSTITUTES, AND INDIVIDUALS, CASES IN THE SENATE WERE CONSIDERED SEVERAL YEARS. IT IS NECESSARY TO RECOGNIZE THIS METHOD OF THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION INEFFECTIVE. GOVERNORS HAD TO RECKON WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, TO AGREE, LOOK FOR A COMPROMISE. THE FACTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ARBITRARY BEHAVIOR FROM "OWNERS OF THE REGION" AREN'T ELICITED. THE PERIODS OF CONFRONTATION WERE REPLACED BY A CONSTRUCTIVE COOPERATION. IN THE CONDITIONS OF WAR THE LEVEL OF A CONFLICTNESS WAS AT A LOW LEVEL. IN GENERAL, THE CLEAR GOVERNMENT POLICY ON "EMBEDDING" OF THE CITIES IN SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WAS TRACED.
988	THIS PAPER PROVIDES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) SECURITY COUNCIL'S 'NAMING AND SHAMING' PROVISION IN OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 3 OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1960 (2010), ARGUING THIS IS A COUNTERPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEMPORARY COLLECTIVE SECURITY APPROACH TO WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY. RESOLUTION 1960, THE FIFTH SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION ON WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY, SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDS THE COUNCIL'S APPROACH TO CHALLENGING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ARMED CONFLICT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL INDICATORS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN EXPLANATION OF THE TERMINOLOGY AND CONTEXT OF RESOLUTION 1960 WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 3. THE ARTICLE THEN SHIFTS TO REVIEW THE VALUE OF THE OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 3 NAMING AND SHAMING PROVISION. I ARGUE AGAINST FEMINIST ACTIVISM THAT SEEKS TO DEVELOP ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS FOR NON-STATE ACTORS IN ISOLATION FROM STRATEGIES TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AND SUGGEST THE NEED TO PROMOTE, INSTEAD, STRATEGIES THAT INCREASE WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE MECHANISMS LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY LIST PRODUCED IN THE CONTEXT OF SUCH NAMING AND SHAMING WILL BE UNDERMINED BY THE COMBINATION OF A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTERESTS FOR HUMANITARIAN WORKERS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR MISLABELLING NON-STATE ACTORS, PARTICULARLY MEMBERS OF ARMED GROUPS, AS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN ARMED CONFLICT WITHOUT PAYING APPROPRIATE ATTENTION TO ESTABLISHED DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW. AS SUCH, THE SECURITY COUNCIL'S CURRENT SHIFT TOWARDS GLOBAL INDICATORS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS WILL BE UNABLE TO END SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND GENDER-BASED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY NON-STATE ACTORS IN SITUATIONS ON THE COUNCIL'S AGENDA. I CONCLUDE THAT THE IMPACT OF RESOLUTION 1960 OPERATIVE PARAGRAPH 3 WILL BE MINIMAL: PROMOTING NEITHER WOMEN'S RIGHTS NOR PEACE NOR SECURITY AND WITH THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE INCENTIVES FOR ARMED GROUPS TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CREATION OF PEACE.
989	P>THIS PAPER FIRST ANALYZES THE QUESTION WHY DID CZARIST RUSSIA AND OTTOMAN TURKEY FALL BEHIND THE WEST? IT IS ARGUED THAT INTERSTATE RIVALRY FORCED WEST EUROPEAN RULERS TO RESPECT THE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF PRODUCERS AND SUBJECTS EARLIER AND TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN CZARS OR SULTANS RULING OVER HUGE CONTIGUOUS TERRITORIES EVER HAD TO. INCENTIVES TO WORK WERE BETTER IN EUROPE THAN ELSEWHERE. THE MOBILIZATION OF AVAILABLE KNOWLEDGE FOR PRODUCTIVE PURPOSES WAS EASIER THAN ELSEWHERE. LIMITED GOVERNMENT IMPLIED LESS POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO INNOVATION. COMPARATIVELY SECURE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION MADE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SCARCITY PRICES AND THE RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES EASIER THAN ELSEWHERE. WHEREAS THE WESTERN PAST WAS FEUDAL, THE RUSSIAN OR TURKISH PAST WAS PATRIMONIAL OR EVEN SULTANISTIC. FEUDALISM IS A MUCH BETTER STARTING POINT FOR ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AND SAFE PROPERTY RIGHTS THAN PATRIMONIALISM. THE SECOND ISSUE HAS BEEN THE QUESTION WHY CZARIST RUSSIA COULD OUTPERFORM OTTOMAN TURKEY. HERE THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MUSLIM TOLERANCE OF SLAVERY AND POLYGYNY MATTER. BEING SLAVES, MANY MEMBERS OF OTTOMAN RULING ELITES WERE AT THE MERCY OF THEIR OWNER, THE SULTAN. THEREFORE, THEY BECAME TOOLS OF ARBITRARY RULE. MOREOVER, THE PRACTICE OF POLYGYNY GENERATED DOWNWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND THEREBY ADDED ANOTHER OBSTACLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR PRODUCERS OR MERCHANTS. THE FINAL ISSUE IS THE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS OF RUSSIA OR TURKEY. ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS BETTER IN TURKEY THAN IN RUSSIA. MOREOVER, RUSSIA IS GRAYING, WHEREAS TURKEY MAY LOOK FORWARD TO A GROWING LABOR FORCE. ALTHOUGH A RICH ENDOWMENT IN NATURAL RESOURCES SEEMS TO FAVOR RUSSIA, THE RESOURCE CURSE HAS PREVENTED OTHER RESOURCE RICH COUNTRIES FROM DEVELOPING. THEREFORE, THE TURKISH PROSPECT LOOKS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE RUSSIAN ONE.
990	COMPOSITE INDICES HAVE BECOME A POPULAR TOOL FOR PROVIDING A QUANTITATIVE, SIMPLIFIED, AND VISUALIZED REPRESENTATION OF COMPLEX PHENOMENA. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH IS THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX (HDI) WHICH RANKS COUNTRIES BY THEIR LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PRIMARY LIMITATION OF THE HDI IS ITS NARROW SCOPE, WHICH HINDERS ITS EFFECTIVENESS AT EXPLAINING WHY SOME NATIONS ARE MORE DEVELOPED THAN OTHERS. THE DISCUSSION AS TO WHY SOME NATIONS ARE MORE DEVELOPED THAN OTHERS GOES BACK AS FAR AS THE 14TH CENTURY, WHERE IBN KHALDUN DEVELOPED A THEORY WHICH AIMS TO EXPLAIN WHY CIVILIZATIONS RISE AND FALL. SOME OF THE HYPOTHESES WHICH SEEK TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOMS, ABSENCE OF CORRUPTION, HIGH INVESTMENT IN HUMAN CAPITAL, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONS ETC. TO DEVELOPMENT. ONE HYPOTHESIS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY STUDIED REGARDS THE CULPABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INTRODUCE A COMPOSITE MEASURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT HINDERING BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS, I.E., THE BAD BEHAVIOR INDEX (BBI). THE METHODOLOGY OF THIS STUDY IS INFLUENCED BY THE MAZZIOTTA & PARETO FRAMEWORK FOR COMPOSITE INDICES. THE INDEX WEIGHTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY INTEGRATING EXPERT OPINION WITH THE FUZZY ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (FAHP). THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT AFRICAN COUNTRIES ENGAGE IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BAD BEHAVIOR, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LEADS TO THEIR POOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHEREAS NORTHERN COUNTRIES ENGAGE IN THE LEAST LEVEL OF BAD BEHAVIOR. THE STUDY ALSO FINDS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE LOW LEVELS OF CORRUPTION, HIGH LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE CREATION, STRICT APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIAL COHESION, AND HIGH LEVELS OF POLITICAL STABILITY.
991	THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROPOSE A DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING PLATFORMGOVERANCE PROPOSALS, AND IN DOING SO CLARIFY TERMS OF DEBATE IN THIS AREA, ALLOWING FOR MORE NUANCED POLICY ASSESSMENTS. IT APPLIES A DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY FRAMEWORK ORIGINALLY CREATED TO ASSESS THE EUROPEAN UNION'S DEMOCRATIC BONA FIDES - VIVIAN SCHMIDT'S (2013) MODIFICATION OF SCHARPF'S (1999) WELL-KNOWN TAXONOMY OF FORMS OF DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY - TO VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVE PLATFORM GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS AND POLICIES. THE FIRST SECTION DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE ISSUE OF LEGITIMACY IN INTERNET AND PLATFORM GOVERNANCE, WHILE THE SECOND OUTLINES OUR ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK. THE SECOND SECTION DESCRIBES THE THREE FORMS OF LEGITIMACY THAT, ACCORDING TO THIS FRAMEWORK, ARE NECESSARY FOR DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMATION: INPUT, THROUGHPUT AND OUTPUT LEGITIMACY. THE THIRD SECTION DEMONSTRATES OUR FRAMEWORK'S UTILITY BY APPLYING IT TO FOUR PARADIGMATIC PROPOSALS/REGIMES: FACEBOOK'S OVERSIGHT BOARD (SELF-GOVERNANCE REGIMES); ADJUDICATION-FOCUSED PROPOSALS SUCH AS THE MANILA PRINCIPLES FOR INTERMEDIARY LIABILITY (RULE-OF-LAW-FOCUSED REGIMES); THE HUMAN-RIGHTS-FOCUSED FRAMEWORK PROPOSED BY THEN-UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION; AND THE UNITED KINGDOM'S ONLINE HARMS WHITE PAPER (DOMESTIC REGIME). SECTION FOUR DESCRIBES OUR FOUR MAIN FINDINGS REGARDING THE CASE STUDIES: NON-STATE PROPOSALS SEEM TO FOCUS ON THROUGHPUT LEGITIMACY; INPUT LEGITIMACY REQUIREMENTS ARE FREQUENTLY UNDER EXAMINED; STATE REGULATION IS USUALLY SIDE-LINED AS A POLICY OPTION; AND OUTPUT LEGITIMACY IS A LIMITED STANDARD TO BE ADOPTED IN SUPRANATIONAL CONTEXTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT ONLY BY CONSIDERING LEGITIMACY AS A MULTIFACETED PHENOMENON BASED IN DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY WILL IT BE POSSIBLE TO DESIGN PLATFORM-GOVERNANCE MODELS THAT WILL NOT ONLY STAND THE TEST OF TIME, BUT WILL ALSO BE ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES THEY AFFECT.
992	STATES IN ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE IMPROVE THEIR COMMERCIAL CONTRACT LAW, REFORM JUDICIAL PROCEDURES AND CREATE INNOVATIVE SPECIALIZED COURTS TO HANDLE INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTES SO THAT THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS CAN PLAY A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL ECONOMIES IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD.IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THE CREATION OF SUCH SPECIALIZED COURTS HAS BROADENED THE CHOICE OF WAYS TO PROTECT PARTICIPANTS IN THE GLOBAL BUSINESS COMMUNITY.OVER THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS, INTERNATIONAL TRADE (COMMERCIAL) COURTS HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTED IN CHINA, FRANCE, KAZAKHSTAN, THE NETHERLANDS, AND SINGAPORE.NEW INITIATIVES TO CONSTITUTE SUCH COURTS ARE UNDERWAY; FOR EXAMPLE IN SWITZERLAND THIS ISSUE IS ON THE AGENDA OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.THE PROLIFERATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (COMMERCIAL) COURTS IN EUROPE, SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD RAISES CONSIDERABLE INTEREST AMONG AN ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AS WELL AS PRACTITIONERS.THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW, BASED ON FOREIGN SOURCES, OF THE PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BY SPECIALIZED COURTS.IT IDENTIFIES THEIR KEY FEATURES (ALSO IN TERMS OF PROCEDURAL INNOVATIONS) AND THE MAIN REASONS FOR THEIR CREATION WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES.THE GROWING NUMBER OF SPECIALIZED COURTS, WHICH ADJUDICATE INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, IS CONDITIONAL DUE TO A NUMBER OF REASONS.AMONG THEM THERE ARE: 1) THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, ENSURING ITS COMPETITIVENESS ON A GLOBAL SCALE; 2) INCREASED COMPETITION FOR LEGAL SERVICES MARKETS; 3) THE INTEREST IN ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES; 4) THE SPECIALIZATION OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY; 5) INCREASING THE PRESTIGE AND REPUTATION OF NATIONAL LAW IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.THE FORMATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (COMMERCIAL) COURTS IS AN EXAMPLE OF STATES SUPPORT THEIR ECONOMIES IN THE ARENA OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BY USING THEIR POWER IN THE FORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, OFFERING APPROPRIATE COMFORT, BENEFIT, AND ADVANTAGE.
993	SINCE ITS BEGINNING, THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR HAS BEEN MARKED BY ATROCITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CONFLICT AND AS DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS FAIL TO BRING THE VARIOUS FIGHTING FACTIONS TO ONE TABLE, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO END IN SIGHT FOR THE INCREASINGLY SECTARIAN CONFLICT. THE SYRIAN CRISIS HAS DRAWN IN A RANGE OF OUTSIDE FACTIONS AND THERE ARE REPORTS OF SOME 11,000 NON-SYRIANS FIGHTING ALONGSIDE GOVERNMENT TROOPS, OPPOSITION FORCES AND OTHER, OFTEN RELIGIOUSLY-INSPIRED GROUPS. WHILE MOST OF THESE SO-CALLED FOREIGN FIGHTERS COME FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES, AROUND 20 PERCENT OF THEM ARE ESTIMATED TO COME FROM EUROPE. AUTHORITIES AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TRY TO COUNTER THESE WORRYING DEVELOPMENTS VIA A PLETHORA OF MEANS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSSES ON THE QUESTION OF WHAT LEGAL TOOLS AND MEASURES LEGISLATORS CAN AND SHOULD UTILISE TO PREVENT POTENTIAL FIGHTERS FROM TRAVELLING TO SYRIA AND/OR PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS UPON THEIR RETURN, FOR EXAMPLE FOR ACTS COMMITTED WHILE ABROAD OR THE POSSIBLE PREPARATION OF TERRORISMRELATED ACTS. IT ANALYSES THE LEGAL AVENUES AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEVELS FOR ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS. AS CONCERNS THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EUROPEAN STATES THAT APPEAR TO HAVE THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF DEPARTED FOREIGN FIGHTERS: BELGIUM, FRANCE, GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK). THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT RULE OF LAW RESPONSES TO THE FOREIGN FIGHTER PHENOMENON IN THE COUNTRIES INVESTIGATED REMAINS FRAGMENTED. ALTHOUGH AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL, THE ATTACKS IN BELGIUM IN MAY 2014 HAVE MEANT THAT CALLS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE FOREIGN FIGHTER PHENOMENON HAVE BECOME MORE URGENT, IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER EUROPE WILL SOON HAVE A UNION-WIDE RESPONSE TO THIS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING PROBLEM.
994	ARTICLE 2 OF THE CIVIL CODE STIPULATES THE LIST OF CIVIL LAW PRINCIPLES AS THE BASIS OF CIVIL LAW. THE LEGISLATOR NAMED IT THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES AND SUBSTANTIATES THE THESIS THAT THE SPECIFIED LIST OF PRINCIPLES DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE CHARACTERISTICS INHERENT TO THE SYSTEM. BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY OF SYSTEM STUDIES, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT EITHER FOR FUNCTIONING OF THE SYSTEM OF CIVIL LAW PRINCIPLES, OR FOR ANY OTHER SYSTEM, THE NUMBER OF ITS ELEMENTS DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL. THE AUTHOR OFFERS TO PLACE THE MAIN EMPHASIS ON THE SYSTEM'S STRUCTURE, PECULIARITIES OF ITS ELEMENTS, THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF LINKS WHICH COMBINE THESE ELEMENTS, SEARCH OF THE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT CRITERION. THE AUTHOR BRINGS IN A DEFINITION OF THE SYSTEM OF CIVIL LAW PRINCIPLES UNDER WHICH IS PROPOSED TO UNDERSTAND A HOLISTIC, STRUCTURALLY ORGANIZED UNITY OF PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE INTERACTED WITH EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS WITH PRINCIPLES OF OTHER BRANCHES OF LAW, AND GUARANTEE EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF CIVIL LAW RELATIONS. THE AUTHOR INTRODUCES PROPOSALS ON CHANGES TO THE ARTICLE 2 OF THE CIVIL CODE AIMED AT FORMING AN INTEGRAL AND EFFICIENTLY FUNCTIONING SYSTEM OF CIVIL LAW PRINCIPLES. MORE SPECIFICALLY IT IS PROPOSED TO REFUSE FROM THE PRACTICE OF CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL (COMMON LAW) PRINCIPLES IN CIVIL LAW REGULATIONS BY THE WAY OF DELETING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL ORIENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES REGULATION FROM THE ARTICLE 2 OF THE CIVIL CODE. ALSO THE CONCLUSION IS MADE ON THE NECESSITY OF AMENDMENT OF THE NAME OF PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC INTERESTS' PRIORITY, OR ITS EXCLUSION FROM THE CIVIL CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS.
995	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES, FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, THE WORKING ANDFUNCTIONING OF THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM OF OUTSOURCING LABOUR REGULATION IN CHINA. THIS EXAMINATION IS CONDUCTED FROM TWO ANGLES. FIRST, BY ADOPTING THE ANALYTICAL TOOL OF CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, IN PARTICULAR HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, IT IS FOUND THAT GENERALLY THE OUTSOURCING REGULATION SYSTEM POSSESSES ITS FULL LEGITIMACY AND SPECIAL VALUE IN REALISING BUSINESS ENTITIES' RESPONSIBILITIES TO RESPECT, PROTECT, FULFIL AND PROMOTE LABOURS' FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ALSO SET SOME MINIMUM LEGAL REQUIREMENTS IN THIS REGARD. SECOND, REVIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC LAW AND POLICY, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THAT MANY LEGAL QUESTIONS ARISING FROM THE OUTSOURCING OF LABOUR REGULATION IN CHINA HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED BY EITHER THE GOVERNMENTAL OR THE NONGOVERNMENTAL LABOUR REGULATION SYSTEM. SOME REPRESENTATIVE LEGAL ISSUES ARE ILLUSTRATED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSES ARE THREE PAIRS OF CONTROVERSIES, I.E. THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE IDEAL STANDARDISED MODEL NORMS VIS-A-VIS THE REALISTIC SPECIFIED LOCAL SOCIETAL CONCERNS; THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL NORMS VIS-A--VIS THE NECESSITY FOR OFFICIAL AUTHORITIES' LEGAL GUIDANCE AND ENFORCEMENT; AND THE CONTROVERSY BETWEEN THE INTERNAL INTERESTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTION CHAIN VIS-A-VIS THE EXTERNAL INTERESTS OF OUTER STAKEHOLDERS. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, THE FOREIGN BUYER COMPANIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS MUST NOT NEGLECT THE PARTICULAR SOCIETAL CONCERNS AND DEMANDS IN CHINA, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CHINESE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES SHOULD PROMOTE AND DIRECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL LABOUR REGULATION BY IMPROVING THE GOVERNANCE OF RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS POLICY MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION. SOME TENTATIVE PROPOSALS ARE RAISED FOR SOLUTION.
996	LEGAL EDUCATION REFORM HAS RECENTLY EMERGED AS A KEY COMPONENT IN THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION REPUBLICS, 1 NOW SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATES COLLECTIVELY KNOWN, FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER, AS THE NEW INDEPENDENT STATES (NIS). SCHOLARLY ARTICLES AND INTERNATIONAL FORUMS 2 SUGGEST THAT LEGAL EDUCATION REFORM COULD BE ADVANCED BY DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES FOR LAW SCHOOLS, UPDATING LAW SCHOOL CURRICULA, ESTABLISHING TRANSPARENT AND RIGOROUS GRADING STANDARDS, AND RETRAINING THE LAW FACULTY. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES JUST ONE OF THESE MEASURES, NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF QUALITY EVALUATION AND ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES FOR LAW SCHOOLS IN THE NIS REGION. IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THIS ISSUE IN DETAIL, THE PAPER HAS BEEN STRUCTURED INTO SIX PARTS. PART I PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF LEGAL EDUCATION IN THE SOVIET UNION, THUS PLACING THE ISSUES TACKLED IN THIS PAPER INTO A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. PART II DESCRIBES THE MAIN CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN GENERAL AND LEGAL EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR IN THE NIS REGION AFTER 1991, EMPHASISING NEW CHALLENGES THAT PRIVATISATION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR POSED TO THE QUALITY OF LEGAL EDUCATION, THUS TRIGGERING AN URGENT NEED FOR QUALITY-ASSURANCE AND ACCREDITATION MECHANISMS. THE CURRENTLY EXISTENT NIS PRACTICES OF LICENSING, EVALUATION AND ACCREDITATION OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING LAW FACULTIES WITHIN MULTI-DISCIPLINARY ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS SEPARATE LAW SCHOOLS, ARE DESCRIBED IN PART III. PARTS IV AND V ADOPT A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO ACCREDITATION BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE RECENT INITIATIVE AND TRENDS IN QUALITY EVALUATION AND ACCREDITATION IN WESTERN EUROPE. DRAWING UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN PARTS I-V, PART VI OFFERS CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES IN THE NIS REGION.
997	DIGITALIZATION OF THE SWEDISH ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF ATTENTION FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND LEGISLATOR FOR DECADES, WITH THE EXPLICIT GOAL OF BEING THE "BEST IN THE WORLD" AT USING THE POSSIBILITIES OF DIGITALIZATION. THE SWEDISH PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WERE EARLY ADAPTERS AND HAVE UTILIZED AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES SINCE THE 1970'S. THE EFFECTS ON TWO AREAS CENTRAL TO SWEDISH CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE ADDRESSED HERE: GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WITH A FOCUS ON ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING, AND TRANSPARENCY RULES AND ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS. THE REGULATORY RESPONSES IN THE TWO AREAS DIFFER. WHILE CONCERNS REGARDING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DIGITALIZATION ON ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS PROMPTED THE SWEDISH LEGISLATOR TO INCLUDE DIGITAL RECORDINGS AMONG DOCUMENTS ENCOMPASSED BY THE RIGHT TO ACCESS ALREADY IN THE 1970S, GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS BEEN ADAPTED TO A VERY LIMITED EXTENT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS OVER THE YEARS COMMISSIONED SEVERAL GOVERNMENTAL ENQUIRIES ON TECHNICAL, SOCIETAL, AND LEGAL CHALLENGES OF DIGITALIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION, BUT THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS IN REGARD TO THE SUITABILITY OF AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING HAVE BEEN LEFT TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COURTS. TWO REASONS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. FIRST, IT HAS BEEN A LONGSTANDING AIM THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURAL RULES ARE TO BE TECHNOLOGY-NEUTRAL, IN ORDER NOT TO BECOME OBSOLETE THROUGH FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. SECOND, ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES HOLD A STRONG AND PARTIALLY INDEPENDENT POSITION IN THE SWEDISH CONSTITUTIONAL SETTING, COMBINED WITH A TRADITION OF PRAGMATISM. AUTHORITIES CAN THUS BE TRUSTED TO PERFORM THEIR DECISION-MAKING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, WHETHER THE PROCEDURES ARE CARRIED OUT MANUALLY, DIGITALLY, OR BY AUTOMATED MEANS. SWEDISH COURTS HAVE THUS FAR REFRAINED FROM INTERVENING. STILL, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SWEDISH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LANDSCAPE IN AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING CONTAINS SEVERAL CENTRAL LACUNAS, WHICH OUGHT TO BE FILLED IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION AND THE RULE OF LAW.
998	THE RESEARCH SUBJECT. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE POSITION THAT "JUDGE SUBMITS TO THE LAW". THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND EVALUATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE "FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD" FORMULA IN ASSESSING LEGISLATIVE REGULATIONS. METHODOLOGY. THIS RESEARCH UTILIZES A LEGAL ANALYSIS AND CONCEPTUAL EXAMINATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. IT ALSO INVOLVES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES WITHIN THE POST-SOVIET CONTEXT. MAIN RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY MAY NOT ALWAYS ALIGN WITH SOCIETAL INTERESTS. THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION TO THE PRINCIPLE, ALLOWING JUDGES TO EVALUATE AND CHALLENGE THE ILLOGICALITY OR UNFAIRNESS OF LEGISLATIVE REGULATIONS. THE "FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD" FORMULA, WITH ITS LOW STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING SUCH FLAWS, SAFEGUARDS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND SHIELDS JUDGES FROM POTENTIAL POLITICAL PRESSURES. SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH CAN BE APPLIED WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, PARTICULARLY IN POST-SOVIET JURISDICTIONS, WHERE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND THE DOCTRINE OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM IS OF SIGNIFICANT RELEVANCE. CONCLUSION. THE STRICT FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW (LEGALITY) IS NOT A GOAL, BUT A MEANS OF ENSURING THE CERTAINTY AND STABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE HARMONIZATION OF PUBLIC LIFE. BASED ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW CONTRA LEGEM, THE COMMUNICATION OF THE POST-SOVIET JUDGE AND LEGISLATOR SHOULD BE VIEWED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A THREELAYERED RELATIONSHIP OF "SUBORDINATION - COOPERATION - OPPOSITION".
999	COPYRIGHT LAW DENIES PROTECTION TO LEGAL TEXTS THROUGH A RULE KNOWN AS THE "GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE." ENTIRELY A CREATION OF NINETEENTH CENTURY COURTS, THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE TREATS EXPRESSION PRODUCED BY LAWMAKERS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR LAWMAKING FUNCTION AS ALTOGETHER UNCOPYRIGHTABLE. DESPITE HAVING BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER A CENTURY, THE DOCTRINE REMAINS SHROUDED IN SIGNIFICANT MYSTERY AND COMPLEXITY. LACKING STATUTORY RECOGNITION, THE DOCTRINE HAS COME TO BE SEEN AS DRIVEN BY OPEN-ENDED CONSIDERATIONS OF "PUBLIC POLICY" THAT DRAW ON THE OVERARCHING IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO LAWS. IN ITS DECISION IN GEORGIA V. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG., INC., THE SUPREME COURT REAFFIRMED THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DOCTRINE BUT REFUSED TO ENDORSE THE PUBLIC POLICY JUSTIFICATION COMMONLY OFFERED FOR ITS EXISTENCE, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO ROOT IT IN COPYRIGHT'S PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORSHIP. IN SO DOING HOWEVER, THE COURT REFRAINED FROM EXPLICATING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AUTHORSHIP AND THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE DOCTRINE'S MYSTERY. THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A THEORY OF THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE THAT ANCHORS IT FIRMLY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORSHIP. THE AUTHORSHIP RATIONALE FOR THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE IS ROOTED IN A "PERSONALIZATION MISMATCH": WHEREAS AUTHORSHIP IN COPYRIGHT LAW IS PREDICATED ON THE NEED TO PERSONALIZE A WORK BY IDENTIFYING THE HUMAN ACTOR THAT CREATED IT, A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW NECESSITATES THAT LAWMAKING AND LEGAL DIRECTIVES BE IMPERSONAL AND DERIVE THEIR AUTHORITY NOT FROM AN IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL. IT IS THIS BASIC MISMATCH WHICH EXPLAINS THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE AND ITS PRINCIPLED ROOTS IN COPYRIGHT LAW RATHER THAN BROADER CONSIDERATIONS OF PUBLIC POLICY. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE COMPETING (AND CONFUSING) NORMATIVE IDEAS THAT HAVE INFLUENCED THE EVOLUTION OF THE DOCTRINE, DEVELOPS THE ANALYTICAL BASIS OF ITS CONNECTION TO AUTHORSHIP, AND SHOWS HOW THIS CONNECTION ENABLES THE DOCTRINE TO BE EXTENDED AND APPLIED TO NEW FORMS AND MODES OF LAW AND LAWMAKING.
