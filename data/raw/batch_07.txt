0	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF REGULATION-DRIVEN TRADE BARRIERS ON EXPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A PANEL OF 60 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2006 AND 2014. THE PAPER FINDS ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT UNFAVORABLE TRADE REGULATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE EXPORT ENTRY RATE AND EXPORT ENTRY DENSITY (TWO CRITICAL MEASURES OF EXPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP) BY INCREASING THE TIME AND COST ASSOCIATED WITH DOCUMENTARY AND CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LESS CONDUCIVE BUSINESS REGULATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT DOMESTIC SUPPLY CONSTRAINT WHICH IMPEDES EXPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY INCREASING TRADE COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGULATION-DRIVEN TRADE BARRIERS IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WITH POOR GOVERNANCE QUALITY. TWO MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY (I.E., POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW) ARE SHOWN TO BE RELATIVELY MORE SIGNIFICANT IN AIDING FAVORABLE TRADE REGULATIONS THAT PROMOTE EXPORT ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FURTHERMORE, A REDUCTION IN REGULATION-DRIVEN TRADE BARRIERS HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NET ENTRY RATE AND SURVIVAL RATES OF FIRST-, SECOND- AND THIRD-YEAR EXPORTERS, AND HIGH-QUALITY GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP.
1	THE POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN 2011 LED TO MANY REGIME CHANGES THAT RESULTED IN AMENDED OR NEW CONSTITUTIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REGION. THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATES CONCENTRATED MAINLY ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONS IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESSES, AND THE ROLE OF ISLAM DURING AND AFTER THE UPRISINGS. HOWEVER, NO RESEARCH HAS ANALYZED THE IDEOLOGICAL DIMENSIONALITY OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONS. BY ANALYZING 19 NEWLY ENACTED, DRAFTED, AND AMENDED CONSTITUTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THE POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN THE REGION, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE SINGLE IDEOLOGICAL DIMENSION IN THE CONSTITUTIONS CAN BE DEFINED BY THE OPENNESS OF A STATE FOR LIBERAL AND MODERN VALUES. THIS IDEOLOGICAL DIMENSION ENCOMPASSES ALL THE REGIONAL POLITICAL DEBATES ON THE POLITICAL REGIME DYNAMICS, THE INCLUSION OF RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES, AND THE ROLE OF ISLAM. BESIDES OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE TYPOLOGY FOR THE CONSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION, THIS ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH PHASE OF ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT MERGES THE IDEAS OF RULE OF LAW, WHICH ORIGINATES FROM DEMOCRATIC NOTIONS, AND ISLAMIC NORMS.
2	GENDER IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY STUDIED VARIABLES IN THE LITERATURE ON JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. WE ADD TO THIS LITERATURE BY HYPOTHESIZING THAT THE IMPACT OF APPLICANT GENDER IS CONDITIONAL ON THE GENDER BALANCE IN A JUDGE'S CASELOAD. WE EXPECT THAT FEMALE APPLICANTS RECEIVE MORE FAVORABLE DECISIONS FROM JUDGES WHOSE CASELOAD SKEWS STRONGLY MALE. ANALYZING OVER 40,000 RULINGS BY THE AUSTRIAN ASYLUM COURT BETWEEN 2008 AND 2013, WE FIND SUPPORT FOR DIRECT GENDER EFFECTS FOR APPLICANTS AND JUDGES (YET NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO). WE ALSO SHOW THAT GENDER BALANCE IN THE CASELOAD IS A STRONG MODERATOR OF APPLICANT GENDER. JUDGES WITH PREDOMINANTLY MALE CASELOADS ARE STRONGLY BIASED TOWARD FEMALE APPLICANTS, WHEREAS JUDGES FACING A GENDER-BALANCED SET OF APPLICANTS DISPLAY HARDLY ANY GENDER BIAS AT ALL. THESE FINDINGS TACKLE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY INDICATE THAT APPLICANTS' FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR AND EQUAL TRIAL MAY HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED. WE DISCUSS INSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR GENDER BIAS IN AUSTRIAN ASYLUM ADJUDICATION.
3	SINCE THE 1990'S, CHINA'S MARINE MANAGEMENT HAS UNDERGONE A SERIES OF DEVELOPMENTS. IT HAS PROGRESSED FROM LAWLESSNESS TO THE RULE OF LAW, FROM BLIND DEVELOPMENT TO A RATIONAL PLANNING AND FROM OVER-EXPLOITATION TO ECOLOGICAL USE OF MARINE RESOURCES. BASED ON THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MARINE UTILIZATION IN CHINA, THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE CONCEPT OF THE "ECOLOGICAL UTILIZATION OF MARINE RESOURCES (EUMR)" AND ITS DEVELOPMENT, CONNOTATION AND FOUNDATION. FURTHERMORE, IT PRESENTS THE NEW REGULATIONS ON CHINA'S REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURAL PLANNING FOR MARINE UTILIZATION, PROTECTION AND UTILIZATION OF THE COASTLINE, MARINE ECOLOGICAL RED LINE, AND OTHERS. LASTLY, THIS PAPER PROPOSES SOME SUGGESTIONS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUMR FROM FOUR ASPECTS, NAMELY, THE ECOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, ECOLOGICAL PROTECTION, RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND REMEDIATION. ADHERING TO THE EUMR HAS BECOME THE NEW PRINCIPLE OF MARINE MANAGEMENT IN CHINA, AND THIS PRINCIPLE PROVIDES A DIRECTION FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS REGARDING THE EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF THE MARINE RESOURCES AND DETERIORATING ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN ACT AS A HEALTHY BASE OF MARINE MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCES FOR OTHER COASTAL COUNTRIES TO STUDY AND FOLLOW THEM.
4	THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS OF GOVERNANCE IN FIGHTING TERRORISM IN FIFTY-THREE AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR PERIOD 1996-2012. FOUR TERRORISM VARIABLES ARE USED: DOMESTIC, TRANSNATIONAL, UNCLEAR, AND TOTAL TERRORISM DYNAMICS. NINE BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE VARIABLES ARE EMPLOYED: POLITICAL STABILITY (NO VIOLENCE), VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, CORRUPTION CONTROL, THE RULE OF LAW, AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSIONS. IN THE ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE, WE FIRST BUNDLE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS BY MEANS OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS BEFORE ENGAGING THE EMPIRICAL EXERCISE WITH THE FULL SAMPLE. IN THE FINAL STEP, SPECIFICATIONS ARE BASED ON A DECOMPOSED FULL SAMPLE IN ORDER TO ARTICULATE THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES. THE FOLLOWING BROAD FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, GOOD GOVERNANCE IS AN APPEALING TOOL IN FIGHTING TERRORISM. SECOND, THE RELEVANCE OF THE GOOD GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS IS AS FOLLOWS IN ORDER OF INCREASING RELEVANCE: ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE, AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE. THE FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED IN INCREASING ORDER OF MAGNITUDE TO EMPHASIZE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES IN WHICH GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS HAVE THE HIGHEST EFFECT IN MITIGATING TERRORISM.
5	THE RIGHT TO APPEAL A CONVICTION AND/OR SENTENCE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE RIGHT TO HAVE A CONVICTION OR SENTENCE 'REVIEWED' IS RECOGNISED UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND, IN SOME AUSTRALIAN JURISDICTIONS, AS A SPECIFIC STATUTORY HUMAN RIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY STATUTES IN AUSTRALIA PROVIDE THAT AN APPLICANT MUST FIRST OBTAIN LEAVE (OR SPECIAL LEAVE) TO APPEAL A CONVICTION OR SENTENCE (AND OTHER JUDGMENTS) BEFORE THE APPEAL PROPER CAN BE DETERMINED. THERE THUS EXISTS A TENSION BETWEEN THE 'RIGHT' TO APPEAL AND THE REQUIREMENT TO FIRST OBTAIN 'LEAVE' TO APPEAL. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE WAY IN WHICH THE LAW IN VICTORIA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS, REGULATES THE GRANT OF LEAVE IN CRIMINAL CASES. IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE BROADER QUESTION OF WHETHER THE REQUIREMENT OF LEAVE CAN BE RECONCILED WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO HAVE A CONVICTION AND SENTENCE 'REVIEWED' UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND UNDER THE CHARTERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY AND VICTORIA.
6	WHAT MIGHT THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (IACTHR) GAIN FROM A 'JUDICIAL DIALOGUE' WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) IN THE FORM OF BORROWING THE ECTHR'S MARGIN OF APPRECIATION DOCTRINE? ARGUABLY, A FAVORABLE INTERPRETATION OF THE VAGUE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION DOCTRINE ALLOWS THE ECTHR TO PROVIDE BOTH HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND DEFERENCE TO DOMESTIC DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING. THIS MAY GUIDE THE IACTHR'S ATTEMPT TO RESPECT BOTH THE AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS SOVEREIGN CREATORS. IN PARTICULAR, THE ECTHR'S DOCTRINE MAY ILLUSTRATE HOW THESE REGIONAL COURTS CAN INTERACT WITH STATES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPECTIVE CONVENTIONS AFTER LESS THAN FULLY DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES-IN THE EYES OF THE COURTS. THE SAME MARGIN OF APPRECIATION DOCTRINE MAY JUSTIFY MORE OR LESS SOVEREIGNTY-INVADING STANCES BY BOTH THE IACTHR AND BY THE ECTHR, DEPENDING ON TO THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ENTRENCHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC CULTURE AND RULE OF LAW IN THE STATE OF CONCERN, AND DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL DELIBERATIONS CARRIED OUT IN THE PARTICULAR CASE.
7	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DEVELOPED A STATE-BUILDING STRATEGY FOR THE ASPIRING MEMBER STATES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. DEMANDING FULL COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY), THE EU MADE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PART OF THE ACCESSION DEMANDS. SCHOLARS HAVE RECENTLY CRITICIZED THE EU'S LIMITED FOCUS ON RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE AS OPPOSED TO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THIS PAPER GOES BEYOND SUCH IMPACT-ORIENTATED ANALYSES BY ASKING WHY THE EU ENGAGED WITH RETRIBUTIVE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE EU CONSTRUCTED ICTY-CONDITIONALITY BY MIRRORING ITS OWN POST-SECOND WORLD WAR EXPERIENCES TO THE ENVISIONED POST-CONFLICT TRAJECTORY OF THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE EU THEREFORE EXPECTED THE COURT TO CONTRIBUTE TO RECONCILIATION, DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. USING SERBIA AS A CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONDITIONALITY'S CONTEXT, SPECIFICITIES AND DISCURSIVE CLAIMS. FINALLY, IT RELATES THESE FINDINGS TO THE AGENDA OF A PROMISING REGIONAL INITIATIVE PRIORITIZING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE (RECOM) AND SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THE IMPACT OF ICTY-CONDITIONALITY ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN THE WESTERN BALKANS.
8	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE AUTOMATIC EXCEPTIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 297 OF THE UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA TO THE COMPULSORY PROCEDURES ESTABLISHED IN SECTION2 OF PART XV. THE CONVENTION'S DRAFTING HISTORY IS EXAMINED WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING THE VALIDITY OF THE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED READINGS OF ARTICLE 297(1) ENDORSED BY ANNEX VII TRIBUNALS IN THE SOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNA AWARD AND THE CHAGOS MARINE PROTECTED AREA (MPA) AWARD. THE INTERPRETATION FAVOURED IN THE CHAGOS MPA AWARDTHAT MANDATORY JURISDICTION IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE THREE CASES EXPRESSLY ENUMERATED IN ARTICLE 297(1)IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TEXTUAL EVOLUTION OF PART XV. THE ARTICLE SITUATES THE APPROACH ADOPTED BY THE CHAGOS TRIBUNAL WITHIN A WIDER NORMATIVE TRADITION, WHICH HOLDS THAT ADJUDICATIVE JURISDICTION ARISES IN DEFAULT OF POSITIVE TEXTUAL AUTHORZSATION (UNLESS IT HAS BEEN EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED). IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS APPROACH SHOULD BE EMBRACED BY COURTS AND TRIBUNALS WHEN INTERPRETING THE CONVENTION'S PROVISIONS, AS IT ACCORDS WITH THE DRAFTERS' ASPIRATIONS AND IT SERVES TO STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
9	PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN 'GLOBAL' IN ITS APPLICATION SINCE AT LEAST THE 1960S, WHEN MOST WESTERN COLONIAL EMPIRES HAD DISAPPEARED. STILL, IT IS FAR FROM BEING LEFT UNTOUCHED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WHICH LAW IS UNDERGOING WORLDWIDE AND WHICH SCHOLARS OFTEN CATCH UNDER THE TERM 'GLOBALIZATION'. THE GRADUAL DECLINE OF THE MONOPOLY OF STATES IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE ON-GOING GLOBALIZATION OF THE ECONOMY AND THE CHALLENGES MANKIND IS FACING THREATEN THE AUTONOMY OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EVEN STRETCH IT TO ITS VANISHING POINT. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT WHILE INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS SHOULD NOT REACT DEFENSIVELY, WE SHOULD BE EVEN MORE CAREFUL NOT TO SACRIFICE THE CENTRAL POSITION OF THE STATE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW TOO READILY AS IT IS THE PRIME LOCUS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEY ALSO PLEAD FOR A SHIFT IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACADEMIA FROM THE TRADITIONAL FOCUS ON THE FORMAL ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF LAW AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE TO STUDYING ITS SOCIETAL IMPACT AND POTENTIAL IN FACING GLOBAL CHALLENGES.
10	THIS DOCUMENT IS INTENDED TO INFER ON EFFECTS MACRO - FISCAL BUDGET EXECUTION IS THE LAW OF REPARATION TO THE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE IN 2012 IN THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY. THE CURRENT FINANCE MINISTER, JUAN CARLOS ECHEVERRY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT BY 2012, THIS LAW HAVE A BUDGET OF 2.2 BILLION PESOS, BUT CLAIMS THAT IT IS VERY EMBARRASSING TO ESTIMATE A FIGURE FOR THE TEN YEARS THAT THE RULE OF LAW. THUS, THE BUDGET INCREASES AND THEREFORE MUST GENERATE VARIATIONS IN KEY MACROECONOMIC AGGREGATES AND BALANCES IN THE SECTORS PRIVATE, PUBLIC AND EXTERNAL. THE METHODOLOGY USED TO ESTIMATE SUCH AN EFFECT, IS TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGES THAT HAVE MAJOR MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES SUCH ACCOUNTS, THROUGH A STATIC DEMAND MODEL APPLICATION. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, WE CAN SAY THAT THE 2.2 BILLION PESOS IT WOULD TAKE THE LAW IN 2012, INCREASES THE COST OF NON-FINANCIAL PUBLIC SECTOR (NFPS) AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN ONLY 0.6%, GENERATING AN INCREASE IN DEMAND OF 0.9%, A DEFICIT (NFPS) OF 0.3%, WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR BY 0.4%.
11	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE EVOLVING NATURE OF THE WORK OF THE BLACK SASH, FROM THE FORMATION OF THE ORGANISATION IN 1955, THROUGH THE YEARS OF APARTHEID UNTIL THE PRESENT DAY. IT BEGAN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE CYNICAL ENLARGING OF THE SENATE BY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS INTENT UPON REMOVING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT OF MEN CLASSIFIED 'COLOURED' TO THE FRANCHISE ON THE COMMON VOTERS' ROLL. THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUED TO PROTEST AGAINST INJUSTICE AND TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW, AND IT MAINTAINED ADVICE OFFICES IN ORDER TO ASSIST BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS WHOSE RIGHTS WERE RESTRICTED IN TERMS OF THE 'PASS LAWS'. EVEN DURING TIMES WHEN MANY ORGANIZATIONS WERE UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE, THE ORGANIZATION WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS CAPACITY TO PRESERVE ITS RECORDS, INCLUDING DOCUMENTATION OF ITS ADVICE OFFICE CASEWORK AND THE REPORTS OF MONITORS OF VIOLENCE AND ALSO OF THE 1994 ELECTIONS. THIS MAKES ITS ARCHIVES A VALUABLE RESOURCE, HOUSED IN VARIOUS REPOSITORIES AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND NOW MADE EASIER TO ACCESS BY THE CREATION OF A GUIDE LISTING THE CONTENTS OF EACH.
12	THE IMPACT OF MASSIVE AID ON DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR A DECADE WITH MIXED RESULTS. USING THE RESULTS OF AN ELITE SURVEY ON AID AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE BASED ON KAUFMANN ET AL.' S SIX DIMENSIONS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION), THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CASE-STUDY OF CAMBODIA. THE COUNTRY'S CHALLENGES IN LIGHT OF HIGH AID DEPENDENCE AND 'DUTCH DISEASE' IN THE AID SECTOR ARE ELABORATED, AND DISAPPOINTING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES ARE EXAMINED. DESPITE MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AID, INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY AND INEQUALITY HAVE WORSENED. KEY INFORMANTS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IN AGREEMENT THAT, SAVE FOR POLITICAL STABILITY, AID HAS NOT HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON GOVERNANCE IN CAMBODIA. THE FAILURE ON CONTROL OF CORRUPTION SHOWS HOW HARD IT IS FOR DONORS TO BE TOUGH ON A COUNTRY WITH EXTREME POVERTY. ON THE BASIS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED TO DATE, HOWEVER, AID SEEMS UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER LARGE IMPROVEMENTS IN GOVERNANCE AND IN MANY WAYS MAY EVEN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS FURTHER DETERIORATION.
13	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE TENABILITY OFF. WAYNE BAKER'S VIEWS OF THEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL FEDERALISM AND THE ORIGINS THEREOF IN THE THOUGHT OF HEINRICH BULLINGER WITHIN THE JURISPRUDENTIAL CONTEXT OF THE EARLY CAPE SETTLEMENT (1652-1708). MOST AUTHORS COMMENTING ON THE IDEOLOGICAL ROOTS OF THIS DUTCH SETTLEMENT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY ADVANCED THE UNCRITICAL NOTION THAT DUTCH CALVINISM DETERMINED THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY AT THE COPE. A CRITICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE REFORMED APPROACH OF FEDERALISM, FLOWING FROM NENRICH BULLINGER'S VIEWS OF THE COVENANT, PLAYED A MUCH MORE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THIS EARLY FORMATIVE PHASE OF TYPICAL CAPE JURISPRUDENCE. THIS FEDERAL JURISPRUDENCE PROVIDED A VISION OF LEGALITY BASED ON THE LAW OF GOD END LEGITIMACY INVOLVING THE WHOLE OF SOCIETY BOUND TO THE PRECEPTS IN THE DECALOGUE. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE UNDERPINNINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW APPLIED AT THE CAPE SETTLEMENT CONFIRM BAKER'S CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPACT BULLINGER'S FEDERAL VIEWS HAD ON THE REFORMED WORLD OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES.
14	THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE IS IN A STATE OF REFORM DUE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A DEMOCRATIC, SOCIAL, RULE OF LAW SOCIETY. THE ABOVE MENTIONED NECESSITATED A RETHINKING AND PROPER REFORMATION OF ALL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS OF MODERN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE GENESIS OF THEIR FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE WAS SPECIFIED IN THE TASKS IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, HIGHLIGHTING THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR REFORM, SCIENTIFIC FORECASTING OF PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE THEORETICAL AND LEGAL FEATURES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WERE ADOPTED AS A METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH AS A TYPE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE RELEVANT STATE INSTITUTIONS - LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THEIR ACTIVITIES WERE INVESTIGATED IN THE MAIN LEGISLATIVELY RECOGNIZED AREAS. AS A RESULT, IT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH A LIST OF THEIR CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES: STATE-POWER SPECIFICITY; LEGALITY; THE ENFORCEABLE NATURE OF THE DECISIONS MADE; THE USE OF COERCION.
15	CHINA'S EXISTING PUNISHMENT SYSTEM IS RATIONAL IN THAT IT ACCORDS WITH REALITIES AND IS BASED ON HISTORICAL CONTINUITY. ANY ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD ONLY BE PREMISED ON MAINTAINING ITS BASIC FRAMEWORK AND UPHOLDING THE SPIRIT OF THE RULE OF LAW WHILE PROMOTING EQUITABLE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND EFFICIENT SOCIAL GOVERNANCE. THAT IS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION STIPULATED IN SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE LAWS AS THE PUBLIC SECURITY ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES LAW SHOULD BE ABOLISHED; THE TYPE OF PENALTY IN THESE LAWS SHOULD OPTIMIZED; AND AT THE SAME TIME ALL PENALTIES AIMED AT DEPRIVING PEOPLE OF THEIR LIBERTY SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE CRIMINAL LAW. WHETHER DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY IS INVOLVED SHOULD BE MADE THE CRITERION FOR DISTINGUISHING THE RANGE OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE LAWS THAT STIPULATE PENALTIES. THEREFORE, JUDGMENTS OF THE PUNISHABILITY (STRAFBARKEIT) OF CRIMINAL PENALTIES SHOULD BE MADE THE MAIN BASIS FOR ADJUSTING THE DE JURE BOUNDARIES OF THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. WE SHOULD DEVELOP A RATIONAL AND BALANCED CRIMINALIZATION PATH AND A REASONABLE AND JUST SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENT.
16	TERTULLIAN FIRST COINED THE PHRASE 'THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION'. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHAT THIS ENTAILS. I ARGUE THAT TERTULLIAN'S DISCUSSION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY DERIVES ITS THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE FROM HIS CREATIVE REPURPOSING OF THE ROMAN IDEA OF LIBERTY AS NON-DOMINATION. TERTULLIAN CONTENDS THAT THE ROMAN MAGISTRATES' TREATMENT OF CHRISTIAN CITIZENS AND LOYAL SUBJECTS AMOUNTS TO TYRANNICAL DOMINATION CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF THE TRADITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR NON-DOMINATION: THE RULE OF LAW, RULE IN AND RESPONSIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE, AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS. ON HIS REWORKING OF THESE CRITERIA, HE ARGUES THAT CITIZENS AND LOYAL SUBJECTS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT PUBLICLY ON THE CONVICTIONS OF THEIR CONSCIENCE EVEN IF THESE ACTIONS CONFLICT WITH THE STATE'S CIVIL RELIGION. TERTULLIAN SHOWS THAT NON-DOMINATION IS A HIGHLY FLEXIBLE IDEA THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY ENTAIL THE PARTICIPATORY 'FREE STATE' OF REPUBLICANISM. MOREOVER, BY APPLYING THE LOGIC OF NON-DOMINATION TO QUESTIONS SURROUNDING RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, HE OPENS UP AN IMPORTANT AVENUE OF INVESTIGATION LARGELY IGNORED IN THE CONTEMPORARY REPUBLICAN LITERATURE ON NON-DOMINATION.
17	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE OF SINGAPORE TO ARGUE THAT THE THEORY OF OPEN ACCESS ORDER ADVOCATED BY NORTH AND HIS COLLEAGUES PROVIDES ONE POSSIBLE OPTION ONLY. ALTHOUGH THEIR THEORY OF OPEN ACCESS ORDER EXPLAINS THE WEST RELATIVELY WELL, IT DOES NOT ALWAYS APPLY TO CONTEMPORARY NON-WESTERN COUNTRIES. SIMILAR TO THE CASES OF INDIA AND JAPAN EXAMINED ELSEWHERE, THE CASE OF SINGAPORE SHOWS THAT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS THE OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND THE INTERCONNECTED INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, FINANCIAL MARKET, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RESOURCE ACCUMULATION. IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTRIES WITHOUT OPEN ACCESS IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE AS PRACTICED IN SINGAPORE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IF THEY ENSURE OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND DEVOTE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO ESTABLISHING THE NECESSARY INTERCONNECTED INSTITUTIONS EXAMINED IN THIS ARTICLE. FURTHER RESEARCH ELSEWHERE ON CHINA WILL SIMILARLY DEMONSTRATE THIS INSIGHT.
18	GIVEN THE ACCELERATION OF ECONOMIC CHANGES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ECONOMIES (SSA), A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLLUTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR POLICY MAKERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS ON CO2 EMISSIONS FOR 25 SSA COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2010. WE USE THE REDUCED FORM MODELING TO CONTROL UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY SPECIFIC TO COUNTRIES AND THE GMM DYNAMIC PANEL METHOD TO CONTROL ENDOGENEITY. WE FOUND NO -EVIDENCE IN OUR INVESTIGATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) HYPOTHESIS. INDEED, A MONOTONICALLY INCREASING RELATIONSHIP WITH GDP IS FOUND MORE APPROPRIATE FOR CO2 EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, DEMOCRACY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION INFLUENCE NEGATIVELY CO2 EMISSIONS. ON THE CONTRARY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON CO2 EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS IN REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS SINCE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY NOT ONLY AFFECTS CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS DIRECTLY, BUT ALSO INDIRECTLY VIA ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TRADE OPENNESS.

19	MALI'S COUP DETAT IN MARCH 2012 AND THE SUBSEQUENT OCCUPATION OF NORTHERN MALI BY ISLAMIST AND SEPARATIST REBELS TOOK MANY OBSERVERS BY SURPRISE. HOW COULD AN ERSTWHILE MODEL OF PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION COLLAPSE SO SWIFTLY? WHY DID SO FEW ORDINARY MALIANS STAND UP IN DEFENCE OF THEIR 20-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRACY? COMBINING ACCOUNTS FROM MALIAN AND FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WITH OBSERVATIONS MADE IN BAMAKO LEADING UP TO AND DURING THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF EARLY 2012, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE FAILURES OF MALI'S PRE-COUP POLITICAL SYSTEM. A COMBINATION OF THE TENUOUS RULE OF LAW, WEAK STATE INSTITUTIONS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION DEEPLY ERODED MALIANS' FAITH IN THEIR DEMOCRACY. THE JUNTA THAT OUSTED MALI'S ELECTED PRESIDENT IN MARCH 2012, DESPITE ITS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION, SKILLFULLY MANIPULATED PUBLIC FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS LOCAL SYMBOLS AND DISCOURSES PERTAINING TO HEROIC LEADERS TO GAIN SUPPORT AND LEGITIMACY AT HOME. THE CRISIS IN MALI WAS PRECEDED BY CERTAIN WARNING SIGNS, SOME OF WHICH MIGHT BE APPLIED TO GAUGE THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA.
20	TEN YEARS OF THE POLITICAL PARTIES ACT 2002 (LOPP) ENFORCEMENT HAVE ALLOWED THE COURTS TO ACCUMULATE A VAST EXPERIENCE OF ITS APPLICATION. THROUGHOUT THESE YEARS, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL NUMBER OF FRAUDULENT STRATEGIES BY THE ETA AND ITS POLITICAL WING, IN ORDER TO BE PRESENT INTO DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAPER TRIES TO SUMMARISE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES RAISED BY THE LOPP AND ITS APPLICATION DURING THIS YEARS. PROBABLY, THE RECENT SORTU JUDGMENT SUPPOSES LOPP'S END OF CYCLE. THE LOPP WAS DESIGNED TO OUTLAW POLITICAL GROUPS THAT SUPPORTED TERRORISM. IT HAS ALREADY FULFILLED ITS MISSION. AT LEAST, IT SEEMS THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OPINION IN ITS STC 138/2012, JUDGMENT WHICH DESCRIBES A ROADMAP TO SORTU IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING OUTLAWED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THE RULE OF LAW IS TO ENABLE THAT THOSE WHO PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED TERRORISTS CAN RECTIFY, AND DEFEND THEIR POLITICAL PROJECT THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. IT IS TIME TO REFORM THE LOPP IN AREAS SUCH AS THE REGULATION OF THE INTERNAL DEMOCRACY INTO PARTIES, OR THE INCLUSION OF RACIST AND XENOPHOBIC ACTIVITIES AS A CAUSE FOR BEING OUTLAWED.
21	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE AFTER MASS VIOLENCE. IN THE RECENT HISTORY OF ARGENTINA AND SOUTH AFRICA, HUMAN RIGHTS POLITICS HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TRANSITION FROM REPRESSION TO DEMOCRACY AS A DISCOURSE OF RESISTANCE TO STATE REPRESSION AND AS A FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY FOR THE SUCCESSOR STATE TO MANAGE DEMANDS FOR JUSTICE AND PROMOTE RECONCILIATION. POST-TRANSITION, THEY HAVE PROVIDED A STANDARD FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS AND EVALUATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE ROLES OF VICTIMS, SURVIVORS AND RELATIVES IN THE EXPANSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS POLITICS. WE ARGUE THAT VICTIMS REPRESENT THEIR SUFFERING AS EMBODIED INJUSTICE AND MAKE THEIR VICTIM IDENTITY THE FOCUS OF EFFORTS TO RECOVER A MORAL CONTRACT BETWEEN STATE AND CITIZENS. THE EXPANSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS POLITICS TO INCLUDE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE LIMITS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN RECOVERING FULL CITIZENSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEO-LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PROJECT IN ARGENTINA AND SOUTH AFRICA.
22	THE COMMON LAW HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN CLEAR - THE RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN DO NOT EXIST PRIOR TO BIRTH. A CHILD BECOMES A LEGAL PERSON AND ABLE TO ENFORCE LEGAL RIGHTS UPON BEING BORN ALIVE AND HAVING A SEPARATE EXISTENCE FROM HER OR HIS MOTHER. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE LEFT THIS LEGAL PRINCIPLE INVIOLATE AND EXPLORES WHAT THE STATE OF LAW IS IN RELATION TO PRE-BIRTH. IT ARGUES THAT THERE IS A PRE-BIRTH CONTINUUM WHERE THE LAW PUNCTUATES POINTS IN A LINEAL TIMELINE FASHION AS TO WHEN A PRE-BIRTH "NON-ENTITY" BECOMES A LEGAL ENTITY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO SINGULAR RULE OF LAW WITH RESPECT TO BEING OR BECOMING A HUMAN BUT RATHER A COLLECTION OF DISCRETE AND INCREASINGLY DIVERGENT LEGAL CATEGORIES. THIS RECOGNITION OF A PRE-BIRTH CONTINUUM OR TIMELINE AS TO THE LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THIS "NON-ENTITY" HAS SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND IMPACTS ON LEGAL THINKING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN.
23	AT THE END OF 2020, THE MACRON GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO DISMANTLE THE COLLECTIVE AGAINST ISLAMOPHOBIA IN FRANCE (CCIF). THE CCIF WAS THE PRIMARY ACTOR OF ANTI-ISLAMOPHOBIA IN FRANCE. ITS DISSOLUTION AND THE END OF ITS MISSIONS IN FRANCE WAS A SHOCK FOR MUSLIM COMMUNITIES AND AFFECTED THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THE TRUST THEY PUT IN THE RULE OF LAW. MACRON'S GOVERNMENT JUSTIFIED THE CCIF'S DISSOLUTION IN PART BY ARGUING THAT, BY DENOUNCING INSTITUTIONAL ISLAMOPHOBIA, THE ORGANISATION INCITED ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST FRENCH INSTITUTIONS AND ITS WORKERS. HOWEVER, THE DISMANTLING OF THE CCIF TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE MACRON GOVERNMENT'S FRUSTRATION WITH THE CCIF EFFORTS TO QUESTION ITS POLICIES AND DEFEND MUSLIM RIGHTS. THUS, THE REASONS BEHIND THE DISMANTLING OF THE CCIF DEMAND FURTHER EXPLORATION. AFTER EXPLAINING THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE CCIF, THE EVENTS LEADING TO ITS DISSOLUTION AS WELL AS ITS CONSEQUENCES, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT ITS DISSOLUTION WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND CORRESPONDS WITH A REMODELLING OF THE FRENCH COLONIAL COUNTERINSURGENCY DOCTRINE USED TO FIGHT AGAINST A LARGELY FANTASISED ISLAMIST SEPARATIST INSURRECTION.
24	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION WITH EMPHASIS ON THE EASING OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE REFLEXES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RETROGRESSION TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON THE INTANGIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CONCEPT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REGRESSION AND THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF PESTICIDES IN BRAZIL AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (RIGHT TO FOOD, HEALTH, ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT, AMONG OTHERS). THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES HOW THE RELAXATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION. THUS, THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE STATES' LINK AND ITS ACTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO GUARANTEE, PROTECT AND PRESERVE FUNDAMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. LHE METHOD TO BE USED IS THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE, WITH THE REALIZATION OF A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CANNOT HAVE SETBACKS, BEING A LIMITER OF STATE POWER.
25	THIS PUBLICATION IS A RESULT OF THE JOINT WORK OF AN ERASMUS STUDENT FROM THE NETHERLANDS AND A LECTURER AT SOFIA UNIVERSITY IN BULGARIA AS A HOST COUNTRY. THE PRESENT ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE MAIN CURRENT PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP (EDC) IN TWO EU COUNTRIES - THE NETHERLANDS AND BULGARIA, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF: 1. THE BRIEF BACKGROUND OF THE TRADITION OF DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP IN THE TWO EU COUNTRIES; 2. THE STRUCTURE OF EDC IN FORMAL EDUCATION, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STUDIES AND THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION IN EACH OF TWO COUNTRIES OF EU. THESE POINTS OF VIEW CREATED THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING THE STATE OF THE EDC IN TWO COUNTRIES. THE SUMMARY FROM THIS RESEARCH CAN BE MADE THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENT HISTORICAL PAST AND THE DIFFERENT DEGREE OF DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONAL COMMUNITIES, TODAY THE TWO EU COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR GOALS AND TAKE SIMILAR STATE ACTIONS THROUGH THE LEGISLATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS TOWARDS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES FOR CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
26	IN THE LITERATURE ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED STATES CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES. THOUGH IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS SUCH AS TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND REPARATIONS CAN BE USED BY GLOBAL NORTH NATIONS TO ADDRESS RACIAL INJUSTICE, SOME CONSIDER SOCIETIES TO BE TRANSITIONAL ONLY WHEN THEY ARE UNDERGOING A FORMAL DEMOCRATIC REGIME CHANGE. WE CONCEPTUALIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF LOW-INCOME BLACK COMMUNITIES UNDER THE U.S. IMPRISONMENT AND POLICING REGIME IN TERMS OF THREE CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING TRANSITIONAL CONTEXTS: NORMALIZED COLLECTIVE AND POLITICAL WRONGDOING, PERVASIVE STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY, AND THE FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THAT THESE CRITERIA ARE MET, HOWEVER, DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A TRANSITION IS TAKING PLACE. DRAWING ON THE AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AND ABOLITION DEMOCRACY LITERATURES, WE DISCUSS WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR THE UNITED STATES TO TRANSITION OUT OF ITS PRESENT IMPRISONMENT AND POLICING REGIME. A TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY PUSHING FOR TRUTH AND REPARATION, BUT FOR AN ACTUAL TRANSITION.
27	IN ORDER TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC NUMEROUS COUNTRIES DECIDED TO ADOPT LOCKDOWN POLICIES. IT HAD BEEN A CONSIDERABLE TIME SINCE SUCH MEASURES WERE LAST INTRODUCED, AND THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED ON SUCH A GLOBAL SCALE IN A CONTEMPORARY, INFORMATION INTENSIVE SOCIETY. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH MEASURES MAY DEPEND ON HOW CITIZENS PERCEIVE THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENT TO SET UP AND IMPLEMENT SOUND POLICIES. INDEED, LOCKDOWN AND CONFINEMENT POLICIES IN GENERAL ARE BINDING MEASURES THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT USED TO, AND WHICH RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS AMONG THE POPULATION. FOR THIS REASON GOVERNANCE QUALITY COULD AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF THE BENEFITS RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT'S CHOICE TO IMPOSE LOCKDOWN, MAKING CITIZENS MORE INCLINED TO ACCEPT IT AND RESTRICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. IN THE PRESENT PAPER WE EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EFFICACY OF LOCKDOWN AND GOVERNANCE QUALITY (MEASURED THROUGH WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY REACH BETTER RESULTS IN ADOPTING LOCKDOWN MEASURES.
28	AS A NEW FORM OF AUTHORIZATION WITH INDEPENDENT LEGAL STATUS, THE AUTHORIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM FALLS BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORIZATION. DECISIONS ON AUTHORIZATION OF EXPERIMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM HAVE TWO ASPECTS, VIZ., "THE TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OR TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF A LAW" AND "AUTHORIZING A GIVEN EXPERIMENTING BODY TO IMPLEMENT THIS DECISION." IN ESSENCE, THE FORMER IS THE ORGANIC COMBINATION OF TWO ELEMENTS: SUSPENDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LAW AND FORMULATING A NEW EXPERIMENTAL LAW; IT DOES NOT BELONG UNDER AMENDMENT OF THE LAW. THE LATTER, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION SIMILAR TO ADMINISTRATIVE FRANCHISE. AS A METHOD OF EXERCISING PUBLIC POWER, AUTHORIZATION FOR EXPERIMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM SHOULD FOLLOW THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS LAID DOWN IN THE DECISION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CPC ON CERTAIN MAJOR ISSUES CONCERNING COMPREHENSIVELY ADVANCING THE LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF CHINA; FURTHER, IT MAY NOT OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF THE FORMS OF EXPRESSION OR SUBSTANTIVE CONTENTS DETERMINED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW.
29	THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM HAS UNDERGONE MAJOR CHANGES OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. THESE CHANGES HAVE OFTEN BEEN INTERPRETED AS A MANIFESTATION OF "EXCEPTIONALISM," A TREND THAT SHOULD BE CRITICIZED FOR UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW. WE AGREE WITH THIS DIAGNOSIS BUT WANT TO TAKE A FURTHER STEP BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP TO DEVELOPMENTS IN COUNTERTERRORISM IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SOCIAL PROCESSES TO BE STUDIED. TO THIS END, OUR APPROACH PLACES KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AT THE HEART OF THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SO-CALLED ENEMY CRIMINAL LAW-A LEGAL DOGMATIC UNDERTAKING THAT HAS BEEN USED IN VARIOUS SETTINGS TO REFLECT ON THE ISSUE OF COUNTERTERRORISM-HAS GRADUALLY EVOLVED FROM AN OBJECTIVIST ANALYSIS TO A CRITICAL RESOURCE, WITHOUT ITS AXIOMATICS HAVING FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED. WITH THE HELP OF WHAT, IN FRANCE, IS CALLED THE "SOCIOLOGIE DES EPREUVES," WE SHOW THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CONFRONTATION OF THE DOCTRINE WITH DIFFERENT SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXTS. WE AIM TO DOCUMENT AND HELP EXPLAIN THIS UNIQUE TRAJECTORY FROM A SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE PERSPECTIVE.
30	WHILE A PRESUMPTION AGAINST RETROSPECTIVITY IS APPLIED BY AUSTRALIAN COURTS, IT IS ACCEPTED THAT AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENTS DO HAVE THE POWER TO ENACT RETROSPECTIVE LAWS. PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, THE REQUIREMENT IS SIMPLY THAT RETROSPECTIVITY BE EXPRESSED IN CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS STATUTORY LANGUAGE. UNDERPINNING THIS IS THE IDEA THAT ANY RETROSPECTIVE LAW WILL BE SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENTARY CONSIDERATION AND SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ADOPTED. THIS PAPER WILL CONSIDER WHETHER THE PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY SUPPOSEDLY UNDERPINNING THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY ACTUALLY OPERATES IN PRACTICE, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE OF A JUDICIAL FICTION. THE PARTICULAR EXAMPLES THAT WILL BE CONSIDERED ARE DELEGATED LEGISLATION, CLAIMS OF PARLIAMENTARY CONSULTATION, LEGISLATION BY PRESS RELEASE, AND EXAMPLES OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY REQUIRING JUDICIAL CLARIFICATION. THESE EXAMPLES HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY BETWEEN THE PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY REFERRED TO BY THE COURTS WHEN APPLYING THE PRESUMPTION AGAINST RETROSPECTIVITY, AND THE REALITY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCESS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE DIMINISHED ROLE PLAYED BY PARLIAMENTS IN THE AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM CREATES A VERY REAL RISK OF RETROSPECTIVE LAWS THAT ARE ILL-CONSIDERED AND THAT POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW.
31	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THEORETICAL ISSUES REGARDING THE "LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY" AND "MORAL NORMS GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CHINESE EXPERIENCE. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BASIS OF LAW AND MORAL NORMS NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE DIALECTICAL RELATION BETWEEN "LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY" AND "MORAL NORMS GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY", AS WELL AS THE KEY ROLE PLAYED BY A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AND GUARANTEE OF THE MOVEMENT IN THE DIRECTION OF A LEGAL SOCIALIST PATH WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. A PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE LEGAL SOCIALIST PATH WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IS SOLID LOYALTY TO THE HARMONIOUS COEXISTENCE OF THE BASES OF LAW AND MORAL NORMS IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN THE "LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY" AND "MORAL NORMS GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY" STRICTLY ADHERE TO THESE GUIDELINES, MORAL NORMS ARE SUPPORTING THE LAW-BASIS, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN TURN, MUST BE USED WHEN ADDRESSING ETHICAL CONFLICTS.
32	CHINA HAS UNDERGONE A DRAMATIC ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION SINCE THE EARLY 1980S, AS THE CENTRALLY PLANNED ECONOMY HAS BEEN CHANGED TO A MARKET-BASED ECONOMY THROUGH MARKETIZATION, LIBERALIZATION AND PRIVATIZATION. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION HAS ALSO BECOME A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSITIONS IN POLITICAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS, LEGAL FRAMEWORKS, AND MARKET STRUCTURES ARE INTENDED TO HELP CHINESE FIRMS (ESPECIALLY PRIVATE FIRMS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL FIRMS) AS WELL AS FOREIGN FIRMS TO OPERATE IN A MORE SUPPORTIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS COMMENTARY EXAMINES TWO IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINESE INSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION. FIRST, THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA REMAINS IN AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH INCONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT. SECOND, BECAUSE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION IN CHINA, FORMAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS REMAIN WEAK, AND THUS INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS STILL PLAY A COMPLEMENTARY ROLE IN REGULATING FIRM BEHAVIORS. WE EXPLORE HOW THE CHANGING INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS AFFECT LOCAL AND FOREIGN FIRMS' BEHAVIORS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
33	FILOMENA M. CRITELLI, SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK, UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO, 665 BALDY HALL, BUFFALO, NY 14221 U.S.A. BETWEEN LAW AND CUSTOM: WOMEN, FAMILY LAW AND MARRIAGE IN PAKISTAN IN THIS STUDY, WOMEN'S MARRIAGE EXPERIENCES IN PAKISTAN, SPECIFICALLY THEIR AGENCY AND AUTONOMY TO ENTER AND TERMINATE THEIR MARRIAGES, WERE EXAMINED. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 15 WOMEN LIVING IN A SHELTER IN PAKISTAN WERE USED TO ANALYZE WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE AS ARTICULATED IN THE LAW AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE EXPERIENCED IN PRACTICE. A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN WOMEN'S DE JURE RIGHTS AND DE FACTO EXERCISE OF THEIR RIGHTS IS REVEALED. WOMEN WHO TRANSGRESS NARROWLY DEFINED BOUNDARIES OF BEHAVIOR BY EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS ENCOUNTERED VIOLENCE, FAMILY ESTRANGEMENT AND STIGMATIZATION. SHIFTING ATTITUDES AMONG WOMEN AND A DESIRE FOR GREATER SELF-DETERMINATION REGARDING THEIR MARRIAGES EMERGED FROM THE NARRATIVES. STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND RULE OF LAW AND MASS PUBLIC EDUCATION REGARDING LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN PAKISTAN ARE RECOMMENDED TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ELEVATE THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE FAMILY AND SOCIETY.
34	AS A RESPONSE TO THE ARMED CONFLICT OCCURRED IN LIBYA DURING YEAR 2011, THE EU HAS APPLIED THOSE SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS NOT INVOLVING THE USE OF FORCE. LIKEWISE, THE EU HAS ALLOCATED MORE THAN (SIC) 150 MILLION TO HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN THE REGION; HAVING IMPLEMENTED FRONTEX OPERATION "EPN HERMES EXTENSION 2011" AS WELL; AND HAVING DESIGNED A MILITARY OPERATION IN SUPPORT OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE THERE -THE SO-CALLED EUFOR LIBYA, NEVER DEPLOYED BEFORE. FROM A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE, PEOPLE'S UPRISINGS IN SEVERAL SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN STATES -WHICH IN THE LIBYAN CASE HAS LED TO A CIVIL WAR- HAVE PROVED THE FAILURE OF EU'S FOREIGN POLICY IN THE REGION. IN FACT, EU'S EURO-MEDITERRANEAN POLICY IN THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN MAINLY FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL AND TRADE COOPERATION (ESPECIALLY IN THE ENERGY FIELD) AND ON IRREGULAR MIGRATION CONTROL, TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE FULL RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PEOPLES IN SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN STATES.
35	THERE IS A STRIKING GULF BETWEEN THE FORMAL LEGAL DOCTRINE OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION, AS USUALLY PRESENTED, AND THE UNDERLYING VALUES OF LEGALITY AND EQUALITY THAT UNDERPIN JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN PARTICULAR CASES. THE FORMAL DOCTRINE OF ABSOLUTE PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY NOT ONLY AUTHORIZES THE INFRINGEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, BUT IS SUPPOSEDLY CAPABLE OF ABROGATING EVERY REQUIREMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN PRACTICE, THE OPPOSITE POSITION OBTAINS: FORM IS LARGELY DISPLACED BY SUBSTANCE. COURTS INTERPRET LEGISLATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONSTRAINTS OF LEGALITY, PROTECTING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS BY RECOGNIZING IMPLICIT LIMITATIONS TO PARLIAMENT'S LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY. JUDICIAL DICTA IN THE JACKSON CASE (2005) ILLUSTRATE THE TENSION BETWEEN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, REVEALING THE INADEQUACIES OF STANDARD DOCTRINE. UNDER THE UNWRITTEN, COMMON LAW CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE COURTS SHOULD, AND USUALLY DO, UPHOLD THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY ON WHICH THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND EQUAL CITIZENSHIP ALIKE DEPEND. PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IS ITSELF A DOCTRINE OF COMMON LAW AND, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY INTERNAL TO COMMON LAW THOUGHT.
36	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INTERPLAY OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN KOSOVO AND AIMS AT DISENTANGLING AND EXPLAINING THE EMERGENCE AND PERSISTENCE OF THIS INTERNATIONAL 'INTERIM' REGIME. IN 1999, THE UN MISSION TO KOSOVO (UNMIK) AND THE ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE) WERE THE LEADING INSTITUTIONS IN THE CIVILIAN AREA FOLLOWING NATO'S DEPLOYMENT OF KOSOVO FORCE (KFOR). FOLLOWING THE FAILED STATUS TALKS ON KOSOVO, THE EU'S RULE OF LAW MISSION (EULEX) AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL CIVILIAN OFFICE (ICO) HAVE BEEN SET UP IN ADDITION FOR INCREASING INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY IS EMERGING AND WHAT STRATEGIES INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE APPLYING WHEN CONFRONTED WITH POLICY OVERLAP. THE PAPER FINDS THAT THE EMERGENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY IN KOSOVO IS LARGELY A RESULT OF HISTORICAL LOCK-IN EFFECTS. INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEVELOPED TWO DOMINANT STRATEGIES TO COPE WITH DENSE INSTITUTIONAL SPACES. FIRST, THEY SHOW SIGNS OF A FUNCTIONAL CONVERGENCE AND A COORDINATED POOLING OF RESOURCES. SECOND, INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEVELOPED NICHE COMPETENCES TO AVOID COMPETITION.
37	ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES CREATE HIGH-STAKES CHOICES IN WAR-TORN SOCIETIES. HANDLED WELL, THEY MAY CREATE A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR PEACE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; HANDLED POORLY, THEY RISK UNDERCUTTING AN ALREADY TENUOUS PEACE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE IDENTIFY PATTERNS AND LESSONS FROM THE WORK OF THE UN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME'S POST-CONFLICT AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT BRANCH, WHICH HAS CONDUCTED POSTCONFLICT ASSESSMENTS IN SEVERAL WAR-TORN SOCIETIES OVER THE PAST DECADE. PCDMB'S EXPERIENCE SHEDS CONSIDERABLE LIGHT ON THE NATURE OF CONFLICT-RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, IDENTIFIES POSSIBLE ENTRY POINTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES IN PEACEBUILDING, AND SUGGESTS CAUTIONS ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES TO BE PEACEBUILDING TOOLS. WE IDENTIFY FOUR THEMES EMERGING FROM THEIR WORK: THE MULTIPLE AND OFTEN INDIRECT LINKS BETWEEN VIOLENT CONFLICT AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; THE POLITICAL DIMENSIONS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AS A CONFIDENCE-BUILDING TOOL; RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LINKAGES AMONG THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF WAR-TORN ECONOMIES; AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSIONS OF RECONSTITUTING THE STATE, REGULATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. KEYWORDS: ENVIRONMENT, UNITED NATIONS, PEACEBUILDING, CONFLICT, NATURAL RESOURCES.
38	FEDERATIONS EMPLOY A LARGE VARIETY OF MECHANISMS FOR CONDUCTING RELATIONS BETWEEN CENTRAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THESE MECHANISMS SPAN THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT WITHIN EACH LEVEL. EXECUTIVE INVOLVEMENT RANGES WIDELY IN DEGREE OF FORMALITY, FROM THE MAKING OF FORMAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS TO INFORMAL LIAISON BETWEEN GOVERNMENTAL OFFICERS. EXECUTIVE MECHANISMS HAVE ALSO EVOLVED FOR CORRECTING VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL FISCAL IMBALANCES IN FEDERAL SYSTEMS. LEGISLATURES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GIVING THE FORCE OF LAW TO COOPERATIVE POLICIES INITIATED BY THE EXECUTIVE. THESE LEGISLATIVE MECHANISMS INCLUDE RECIPROCAL SCHEMES, COMPLEMENTARY SCHEMES, MIRROR LEGISLATION, AND THE REFERENCE OR DELEGATION OF POWERS FROM ONE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER. THE JUDICIARY, THOUGH OFTEN UNDERVALUED, IS SIGNIFICANT FOR ITS ROLE IN ESTABLISHING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT CONDUCT THEIR INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS, THROUGH ARTICULATION OF POWERS AND COMPETENCIES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT POLICY MAKERS SHOULD EXERCISE CARE IN SELECTING MECHANISMS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THEIR TASK. IN PARTICULAR, REGARD SHOULD BE HAD TO THE EFFICIENCY OF EACH MECHANISM, AND ITS CONFORMITY WITH FEDERAL VALUES AND THE RULE OF LAW.
39	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE GROWING OPPOSITION TO ARBITRATION OF INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES INVOLVING CHALLENGES TO REGULATORY MEASURES UNDER CHAPTER I I OF NAFTA. THE NAFTA PARTIES APPARENTLY SEEK TO RESTORE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OVER SUCH MATTERS BY SUBJECTING THESE AWARDS TO HEIGHTENED REVIEW BY MUNICIPAL COURTS AT THE SEAT OF ARBITRATION, EFFECTIVELY GIVING CANADIAN, MEXICAN, AND UNITED STATES COURTS THE FINAL AUTHORITY TO INTERPRET CHAPTER 11. WHEN SUCCESSFUL, THIS PRACTICE VIOLATES BOTH THE LETTER OF CHAPTER 11 AND THE INTENT OF THE NAFTA PARTIES TO PLACE INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES WITHIN THE DEFERENTIAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION. ALTHOUGH THE NAFTA PARTIES MAY, ESCAPE LIABILITY FOR SUCH UNLAWFUL CONDUCT, THEY THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THE PAST CENTURY'S EFFORTS TO PROMOTE ROBUST PRINCIPLES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ECONOMIC INJURIES TO ALIENS. FURTHERMORE, ROUTINE DEROGATION FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLUNTARY ACCEPTANCE OF AUTHORITATIVE DECISIONS RENDERED AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL BY IMPARTIAL BODIES CHARGED WITH SUPERVISION OF TREATY COMPLIANCE BODES ILL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS.
40	REFLECTIONS ON THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DELOCALIZATION OF ITALIAN COMPANIES TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ARISING FROM A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY, OFFER INVALUABLE INSIGHT INTO COMPANIES FACING SIMILAR TOUGH CHOICES. USUALLY, THIS DECISION IS ATTRIBUTED TO ECONOMIC, FISCAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PROCESS OF DELOCALIZATION OF ITALIAN ENTERPRISES AND EMPIRICALLY VERIFIES THE MAIN FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE DELOCALIZATION OF ITALIAN ENTERPRISES TO EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT "LABOR MARKET REGULATION", "BUSINESS REGULATION", AND "SIZE OF GOVERNMENT" OR BETTER SAID, THE LABOR COST THE HOST COUNTRY, IS THE MAIN INCENTIVE OF ITALIAN ENTERPRISES TO DELOCALIZE THEIR PRODUCTION. EMPIRICAL RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS "RULE OF LAW", "CONTROL OF CORRUPTION", "POLITICAL STABILITY", AND "BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE" HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH THE DELOCALIZATION OF ITALIAN ENTERPRISES TO THE EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS IN THIS CASE SUGGEST THAT ITALIAN COMPANIES ARE LOOKING FOR AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE STATE KNOWS HOW TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RULES, BUT ALSO A STATE THAT IS SOMEWHAT "CORRUPTIBLE".
41	USE OF ASSESSMENT INDICATORS IN THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF JUSTICE HAS BECOME POPULAR IN MAINLAND CHINA OVER THE PAST DECADE. SURVEY METHODS, AND QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS IN PARTICULAR, HAVE BEEN WIDELY EMPLOYED TO ASSESS THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE EMERGENCE OF RULE OF LAW INDEX PROJECTS AND THE NEED FOR JUDICIAL REFORM IN CHINA HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO JUSTICE ASSESSMENT INITIATIVES. THE REPORT ON CHINA JUSTICE INDEX ( ["CJI PROJECT"]) IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THESE ENDEAVOURS. THE CJI PROJECT USES QUESTIONNAIRES TO ASSESS THE BASIC-LEVEL JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN DIFFERENT PROVINCES OF CHINA AND EVALUATES THE SYSTEM FROM TEN DIMENSIONS. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE CJI PROJECT TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION AND LIMITATIONS OF SURVEY METHODS FOR ASSESSING JUSTICE IN CHINA. SUCH QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS USUALLY INCLUDE FIVE STAGES: (1) INDEX SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION; (2) QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN; (3) QUESTIONNAIRE DISTRIBUTION; (4) VALUE ASSIGNMENT AND (5) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND RESULT PRESENTATION. HOWEVER, THE TENSION BETWEEN THE DESCRIPTIVE AND EVALUATIVE FUNCTIONS OF QUESTIONNAIRES GIVES RISE TO SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES THAT CAN OBSCURE THE VALUE OF QUESTIONNAIRES FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING PROBLEMS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
42	THE PROVISION OF RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE CONTRIBUTES TO THE BUILDING OF EQUITABLE, INCLUSIVE, AND ECONOMICALLY PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES. HOWEVER, MERE LEGAL PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE IN DEVELOPING SOCIETIES REMAINS INSUFFICIENT TO ENSURE DUE PROTECTIONS GUARANTEED BY THE LAW. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF A LEGAL EMPOWERMENT PROJECT IN THE TWO DISTRICTS OF RURAL PUNJAB IN PAKISTAN THROUGH KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE PROJECT LEADS TO AWARENESS AND FULFILMENT OF RIGHTS, FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT, AGENCY DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY OF WOMEN, AND REDUCTION OF OPPRESSION, EXPLOITATION, AND INJUSTICE. IT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN BUILDING INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES WHERE ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION. THIS STUDY EMPHASIZES HOW THE STATE INCLUDING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES SHOULD INSTEAD OF OPPRESSING, EXPLOITING, OR IGNORING THE NEEDY MASSES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM AND DEVELOP THEIR SET OF CAPABILITIES. THIS MULTIDIMENSIONAL PARALEGAL ASSISTANCE MODEL ROOTED IN EXISTING COMMUNITY-BASED STRUCTURES AND SUPPORT IS SCALABLE AND ADAPTABLE.
43	MOST OF THE STUDIES ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING FOCUS ON THE DETERMINANTS OF ABSOLUTE LIFE SATISFACTION OR HAPPINESS LEVELS. THIS PAPER ASKS AN IMPORTANT BUT UNDERSTUDIED QUESTION, NAMELY, COULD COUNTRIES ACHIEVE THE SAME OR EVEN HIGHER SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING BY USING THE SAME RESOURCES MORE EFFICIENTLY? WE PROVIDE THE FIRST COUNTRY PANEL EVIDENCE ON WHETHER NATIONS EFFICIENTLY TRANSFORM THEIR ENDOWMENTS (INCOME, EDUCATION, AND HEALTH) INTO SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND WHICH FACTORS INFLUENCE THE CONVERSION EFFICIENCY. USING DATA ON 91 COUNTRIES FROM 2009 TO 2014, WE FIND THAT THAT WELL-BEING EFFICIENCY GAINS ARE POSSIBLE WORLDWIDE. WE SHOW THAT POOR LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS AS PROXIED BY UNEMPLOYMENT AND INVOLUNTARY PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER 'SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING EFFICIENCY,' WHILE SOCIAL SUPPORT, FREEDOM, AND THE RULE OF LAW IMPROVE IT. THESE FINDINGS ARE USEFUL TO POLICYMAKERS IN HELPING IDENTIFY INEFFICIENCIES, REDUCING WASTEFUL RESOURCE USE, AND DEVELOPING POLICIES THAT PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN WELL-BEING. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO A BATTERY OF SENSITIVITY CHECKS AND RAISE POLICY-RELEVANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE INSTRUMENTS TO IMPROVE SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING EFFICIENCY.
44	A NEW TYPE OF CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC AFFECTS THE ENTIRE WORLD. IT REQUIRES GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE QUICK AND IMPACTFUL DECISIONS THAT PUSH THE LIMITS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS PERIOD IS EXTRAORDINARY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SITUATION AND THE CONSEQUENCES IT PRODUCED. HOWEVER, POLITICAL POWER IS LIMITED IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHETHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ORDINARY OR EXTRAORDINARY. LEGAL BOUNDARIES GET PUSHED IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EXISTING RULES. ORDINARY LAW MUST OFFER APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO COMBAT EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE TOOLS, EXTRAORDINARY LAW IS USUALLY ENFORCED. IN THE PROCESS, THE TURKISH REPUBLIC OF NORTHERN CYPRUS (TRNC) GOVERNMENT HAS STARTED TO IMPLEMENT RAPID MEASURES TO PREVENT EPIDEMICS. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE LEGAL DIMENSION OF THE CURFEW. IT REVEALS THE OUTCOME OF THE CESSATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN EMERGENCY DECLARATION. THE CURFEW WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF EPIDEMIC MEASURES TAKEN UNDER THE USUAL LAW REGULATIONS.
45	THE AMBIGUOUS LEGACY OF MARTIN LUTHER, THE SIXTEENTH-CENTURY GERMAN REFORMER, INCLUDES HIS EXPRESSIVE, INTELLECTUAL REACTIONS TO ARISTOTLE'S IDEAS. HIS VEHEMENT CRITICISM OF THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IN SOME OF HIS LATER WRITINGS MAY HAVE ECLIPSED LUTHER'S MORE BALANCED RECEPTION OF ARISTOTLE IN HIS EARLY CAREER. FURTHERMORE, CAREFUL DISTINCTIONS MUST BE MADE BETWEEN LUTHER'S VIEWS ON MEDIEVAL ARISTOTELIANISM VS THE ORIGINAL IDEAS OF ARISTOTLE. FINALLY, WHEN ASSESSING THE GERMAN REFORMER'S APPRAISAL OF ARISTOTLE, IT IS VITAL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE VERTICAL, CORAM DEO, HORIZONTAL, CORAM HOMINIBUS, HUMAN SITUATEDNESS, AND INTERACTION DIMENSIONS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, DESPITE THE STRONG REJECTION OF ARISTOTLE'S USEFULNESS FOR THEOLOGY BY LUTHER, WE CAN DISCERN A LIMITED USE OF ARISTOTELIAN CATEGORIES BY LUTHER WHEN DEALING WITH SOME MATTERS OF POLITICS AND ETHICS (THE RULE OF LAW IN A STATE AND AN INDIVIDUAL'S VIRTUES). BASED ON LUTHER'S MATURE WRITINGS, WE WILL EXAMINE LUTHER'S NOTIONS OF SIN, CONCUPISCENCE, JUSTIFICATION, DIVINE GRACE, AND HUMAN WILL, AS THESE TOPICS RESONATE IN HIS TREATMENT OF ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHICAL HERITAGE.
46	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY FORMS, MAIN OBJECTIVES AND REGULATORY MEASURES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. THE STUDY INVOLVED THREE METHODS: DIRECT OBSERVATION, COMPARISON, AND ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT OF DOCUMENTS THAT PROVIDE LEGAL REGULATION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AT THE STATE AND INTERSTATE LEVELS. EIGHT IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING DIVIDEND POLICY ARE PRESENTED. THE SUCCESS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY DEPENDS DIRECTLY ON THE REGULARITY OF PROFITS AND THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY, WHILE IT IS INVERSELY DEPENDENT ON THE REGULARITY AND SIZE OF DIVIDENDS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE TYPE AND FORM OF DIVIDEND POLICY IS PARTLY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND PARTLY DETERMINED BY NON-LEGAL BUSINESS FACTORS. AN OPTIMAL DIVIDEND POLICY MEANS THAT THERE MUST BE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE PAYMENT OF CURRENT DIVIDENDS AND THE FUTURE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY'S PROFITS. IN THIS CASE, THE PROCEDURE ESTABLISHED BY LAW AND THE SEQUENCE OF SHARES PRECEDING THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS INDICATES THE PARTIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL FREEDOM OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS CASE.
47	TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE "FREE" OR "PROTECTED" WHEN IT COMES TO WAIVING OUR OWN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ? TODAY, SUCCESSFULLY CITING "PERSONAL AUTONOMY", "FREE AND INFORMED CONSENT", OR "FREEDOM OF CHOICE" TO WAIVE ONE'S OWN RIGHTS CAN BE CONSIDERED THE NORM, RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. YET, NEITHER CASE LAW NOR DOCTRINE OFFER A COHESIVE FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING THE VALIDITY OF A WAIVER. THE EXISTING ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK USES A BINARY LOGIC TO LABEL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AS BEING THEORETICALLY WAIVABLE OR NON-WAIVABLE, WITH THE FORMER BEING SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL CONSENT. THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS APPROACH IS PROBLEMATIC FROM A RULE-OF-LAW PERSPECTIVE. OF THE TWO MAIN ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING THIS DIFFERENTIATION, ONE IS BASED ON THE LIMITS OF HUMAN DIGNITY, AND THE OTHER ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE RIGHTS. NEITHER OF THESE PROVIDE ADEQUATE THEORETICAL OR PRACTICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BINARY MODEL. THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION IS ALSO INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ALL HUMAN RIGHTS ARE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE, AND SHOULD BE RESHAPED IN LIGHT OF THE UNIQUE NATURE OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PROCESS OF ADJUDICATING THEM.
48	AT THE BEGINNING OF 1990, THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN ADOPTED A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION. THE COUNTRY RATIFIED A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (1990). IN LINE WITH THE IDEA OF GUARANTEEING "GOOD GOVERNANCE" AND RULE OF LAW, ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AND PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED, INCLUDING WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. AS A PART OF THESE REFORMS, THE 2004 CODE ON PERSONS AND FAMILY-WHICH WAS MEANT TO PROMOTE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND UNIFY THE PREVIOUSLY DUAL LEGAL SYSTEM-WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEXTS TO BE ADOPTED. WITH INHERITANCE DISPUTES AS AN ENTRY POINT, THIS PAPER LOOKS AT THE ITINERARIES OF THOSE WHO DECIDED TO TAKE LEGAL ACTIONS AND ANALYZES THE EFFECTS OF THE CODE ON FAMILY DYNAMICS IN COTONOU. IT SHOWS HOW THOSE ON THE LOWER RUNGS OF FAMILY HIERARCHIES USE THE LAW AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN ORDER TO RENEGOTIATE HOW PROPERTIES ARE SHARED, AND TO REDEFINE GENDER AND GENERATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
49	CONSERVATIONISTS AND ACADEMICS HAVE LONG INVESTIGATED THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT FOREST LOSS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME NATIONS. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE, NAMELY STATE SPENDING, MAY IMPACT FOREST LOSS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME NATIONS, ALTHOUGH THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN UNDERSTUDIED AND THE LIMITED RESEARCH THAT EXISTS HAS YIELDED CONTRADICTORY RESULTS. I BEGIN BY REEVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE SPENDING AND FOREST LOSS USING ROBUST REGRESSION MODELS FOR A SAMPLE OF 97 LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME NATIONS. INITIALLY, IN LINE WITH EXTANT LITERATURE, I FIND NO SUPPORT FOR THE IDEA THAT STATE SPENDING IS RELATED TO FOREST LOSS. HOWEVER, I RESPECIFY THE MODELS TO CONSIDER IF STATE SPENDING INTERACTS WITH GOVERNANCE FACTORS INCLUDING POLITICAL STABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND REGULATORY QUALITY. GOVERNANCE IS DEFINED AS THE STATE'S ABILITY TO FORMULATE, IMPLEMENT, AND MANAGE THE NATION'S FUNDS, POLICIES, AND PROCEDURES EFFECTIVELY. I FIND THAT STATE SPENDING REDUCES FOREST LOSS MORE IN NATIONS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE THAN AT LOWER LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE.
50	THIS ARTICLE IS THE RESULT OF AN ADVANCE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT: TITLED "THE LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP IN GLOBALIZATION CONTEXT", FROM WHICH MORE SPECIFIC RESEARCH EMERGES: " CITIZENSHIP LATIN AMERICA: AN CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE" THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE FROM THE DISCIPLINES OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THE SPECIALTIES OF LEGAL SCIENCE THE TRANSFORMATION OF CITIZENSHIP IN THE LATIN AMERICAN STATES AND THEIR ADAPTATION TO THE PHENOMENON OF GLOBALIZATION FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND STATE INNOVATION. THE APPROACH OF THE PROBLEM BEGINS WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT FROM THE FIRST DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF INDEPENDENCE, THE METHODOLOGY OF THE RESEARCH HAS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CHARACTER FOR THE RELATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL DISCIPLINES SUCH AS SOCIOLOGY, PHILOSOPHY, ANTHROPOLOGY, LAW, POLITICAL SCIENCE AND HISTORY AND THE SPECIALTIES OF JURIDICAL SCIENCE THAT FROM ITS BEGINNINGS ARE INTERDISCIPLINARY LIKE SOCIOLOGY, ANTHROPOLOGY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY OF LAW IS CONSIDERED AS MOST APPROPRIATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF METHODOLOGICAL PLURALISM COLLECTING THE METHODS MOST USED BY EACH OF THE PROPOSED DISCIPLINES.
51	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ESTABLISH AND CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION LEVEL AND DEVELOPMENT AMONG EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. OUT OF THE ESTIMATED MODEL IN THIS PAPER ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION CAN EXPLAIN CAPITAL ABUNDANCE DIFFERENCES AMONG EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. ALSO, EXPLANATORY POWER OF CORRUPTION IS HIGHER IN EXPLAINING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAN IN EXPLAINING CAPITAL ABUNDANCE, MEANING STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION LEVEL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAN BETWEEN CORRUPTION LEVEL AND CAPITAL ABUNDANCE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT REDUCING CORRUPTION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR ALL COUNTRIES. SINCE CORRUPTION IS A WRONGDOING, THE RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. HOWEVER, ROOT CAUSES OF CORRUPTION, NAMELY THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT: RECRUITING CIVIL SERVANTS ON A MERIT BASIS, SALARIES IN PUBLIC SECTOR COMPETITIVE TO THE ONES IN PRIVATE SECTOR, THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, AND SOME OTHER CORRUPTION CHARACTERISTICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ANALYZE IN ORDER TO FIND EFFECTIVE WAYS TO FIGHT CORRUPTION. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD GO INTO THIS DIRECTION.
52	JUST TEN YEARS AFTER THEIR TRIUMPHANT "RETURN TO EUROPE" IN 2004, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN (CEE) COUNTRIES ARE FACING A VERY SERIOUS CRISIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THIS CRISIS-WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE EUROZONE CRISIS-HAS A SPECIFIC ORIGIN. THIS ARTICLE WILL SHOW THAT THE RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE LESS ROBUST THAN IN WESTERN COUNTRIES. IN OTHER WORDS, WESTERN DEMOCRACIES CAN COPE MORE SUCCESSFULLY WITH VARIOUS ATTACKS ON THEIR LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THEIR COURTS, MEDIA, HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS, AND OMBUDSMEN HAVE A LONGER AND BETTER-DEVELOPED TRADITION OF INDEPENDENCE AND PROFESSIONALISM. CONVERSELY, WHERE SUCH INSTITUTIONS ARE WEAK AND UNDERDEVELOPED, AS IS THE CASE IN CEE, THERE IS ALWAYS THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF A DRIFT TOWARDS AUTHORITARIANISM AND "ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY." AS EXAMPLES FROM HUNGARY AND SLOVENIA SHOW, EVEN THE MOST ADVANCED CEE DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THIS BACKSLIDING. IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, BOTH COUNTRIES REGRESSED FROM CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES INTO TWO DISTINCT FORMS OF SEMI-AUTHORITARIAN AND DIMINISHED DEMOCRATIC REGIMES. PARTICULAR WORRYING IS THE EASE WITH WHICH THIS REGRESSION OCCURRED.
53	THE BRUTAL GANG RAPE OF A PHYSIOTHERAPY STUDENT IN INDIA IN DECEMBER 2012 DREW THE WORLDS ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN THAT COUNTRY. PROTESTS AND MASS PUBLIC REACTION TOWARDS THE CASE PRESSURIZED THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS BY CHANGING THE LAWS ON SEXUAL VIOLENCE. HOWEVER, THESE NEW LAWS HAVE NOT LED TO A DECREASE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (VAW). IS THIS THE RESULT OF THE FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW-OR DOES IT HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATIONS OF LAW IN ABSENCE OF SOCIAL CHANGE? THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR USING LAW AS A KEY TOOL IN ADDRESSING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN INDIA. IT RECOGNIZES THAT UNLESS WE ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL AND ROOT CAUSES OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, OUR ANALYSIS WILL BE LIMITED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO BRIDGE THE CREATION OF NEW LAWS, WITH AN ANALYSIS THAT SPEAKS TO THE ROLE OF HYPERMASCULINITY, NEOLIBERALISM AND CULTURE IN VAW. IF UNADDRESSED, WHAT MAY RESULT INSTEAD ARE QUICK FIXES, SYMBOLIZED BY THE PASSING OF NEW LAWS THAT ACT AS TOKEN GESTURES RATHER THAN ONES LEADING TO TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION.
54	LEGITIMACY OF CRIMINAL SANCTION IS ORIGINATED ON ITS OWN PURPOSES PURSUED IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THAT LEGITIMACY SHOULD INCLUDE THE PENALTY AS WELL AS SECURITY MEASURES, BEARING IN MIND THAT BOTH ARE IMPOSED TO SOMEONE BREAKING A RULE OF CONDUCT, AND THEREFORE, SOMEONE CAPABLE TO DO IT. REVIEWING PENAL CAPACITY OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY CONCEPTS IS REQUIRED BECAUSE IF PENAL CAPACITY MEANS THE CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY AND ADJUST THE BEHAVIOR TO IT, AND IF EVERY LEGITIMATE CRIMINAL SANCTION HAVE TO BE IMPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY OF BREAK IT, THEN SECURITY MEASURES ALSO HAVE TO BE IMPOSED ONLY TO PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE, CAPABLE TO UNDERSTAND RULES AND ACT IN ACCORDANCE. WITH REGARD TO PEOPLE NOT SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL LIABILITY THEY ARE STANDING OUTSIDE CRIMINAL LAW AND PUNISH THEM WOULD BE ILLEGITIMATE. IN THIS LINE, CRIMINAL LIABILITY SHOULD BE SEEN NOT ONLY AS A CRIME ASSUMPTION BUT ALSO AS A BASIC STATEMENT FOR ANY DIALOGUE THE STATE SHALL HAVE WITH THE CITIZENS: AT THE LEVEL OF CRIME ITSELF, PROCEEDINGS AND SENTENCE EXECUTION.
55	SECURITY FOR PEOPLE, COMMUNITIES AND STATES IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRATISATION AND CONFLICT MITIGATION. POLIFICISED, BADLY MANAGED OR INEFFECTIVE SECURITY BODIES AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS OFTEN CREATE INSTABILITY AND INSECURITY, LARGELY DUE TO THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. STRENGTHENING DEMOCRATIC SECURITY-SECTOR GOVERNANCE AFTER CONFLICT PRESENTS ENORMOUS CHALLENGES, PARTICULARLY: (1) DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A LEGAL FRAMEWORK CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE; (2) DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE, WELL-FUNCTIONING CIVIL MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT BODIES; (3) DEVELOPING VIABLE, ACCOUNTABLE AND AFFORDABLE SECURITY FORCES; (4) ENSURING THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE OF THE SECURITY FORCES SUPPORTS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, INTERNATIONAL LAW, GOOD DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE AND CIVIL MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT BODIES. ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL SECURITY FORCES, CAPABLE CIVIL AUTHORITIES, RULE OF LAW AND REGIONAL APPROACHES. REFORM ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE GUIDED BY LOCAL OWNERSHIP, SENSITIVITY TO THE POLITICS OF REFORM, LOCAL CAPACITY, LOCAL CONTEXT AND A COMPREHENSIVE SECTOR-WIDE FRAMEWORK. LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS MUST MAKE HARD DECISIONS ABOUT PRIORITIES ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DOMESTIC RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACCEPTING EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE.

56	THE INITIAL OPTIMISTIC ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF POSTCOMMUNIST COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT BY NOT SO ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE SOCIETIES. WITH THE GROWING AWARENESS THAT THE POSTCOMMUNIST TRANSITION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS A LINEAR PASSAGE TO A FREE MARKET AND PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY, MORE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES AS WELL AS TO THE LEGACY OF REAL SOCIALISM. THE FEELINGS OF INCREASING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF POSTCOMMUNIST TRANSFORMATION HAVE LED SOME WRITERS TO CHARACTERISE EASTERN EUROPE AS BEING IN THE STAGS OF 'LIMINALITY' (OR IN AN IN-BETWEEN STAGE), IN WHICH 'EVERYTHING MAY HAPPEN GET LITTLE CAN BE DONE' (BAUMAN 1994: 32) ARGUING FROM A TOCQUEVILLIAN POSITION FUR THE NEED OF BOTH A STRONG STATE AND A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY AND ALSO ADOPTING HIS INSIGHT INTO THE IMPORTANCE OF 'ENLIGHTENED INTEREST', I SHALL DISCUSS FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LACK OF GOVERNMENT WHICH OPERATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS DISCUSSING FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR OBSTRUCTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE EMERGENCE OF 'ENLIGHTENED INTEREST' IN THE POSTCOMMUNIST SOCIETIES.
57	SOCIAL ORDER AND STABILITY DEPEND ON MANY SOCIAL FACTORS, AMONG WHICH SOCIAL CONTROL OCCUPIES AN ESSENTIAL PLACE AS A MEANS OF SELF-REGULATION OF SOCIETY, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO STREAMLINE SOCIAL RELATIONS. THIS PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN THE LEGAL PLANE, WHERE CONTROL IS USED TOGETHER WITH OTHER SOCIAL AND LEGAL MEANS AS A DECISIVE FACTOR IN FORMING THE LEGAL ORDER. A PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL STUDY OF CONTROL AND ITS IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THESE CONCEPTS IN HISTORICAL RETROSPECT THROUGH THE PRISM OF THEIR VALUE-BASED CONTENT. THE STUDY'S PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO DETERMINE THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL PARADIGM OF CONTROL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW. THE PRIMARY METHODOLOGY WAS SEVERAL HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH, WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THE SET GOALS. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL PARADIGM OF CONTROL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW WERE IDENTIFIED.
58	IN THIS NOTE, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY SOME PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE INTRODUCTION OF MEDIATION IN UKRAINE IN TERMS OF ITS USE IN THE CONSIDERATION AND RESOLUTION OF COURT CASES. DESPITE THE LACK OF CLEAR LEGAL REGULATION FOR MEDIATION, COURTS IN UKRAINE STILL TRY TO USE THIS MECHANISM OF PRE-TRIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OF COURTS IN CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CASES, IN WHICH COURTS TRY TO EQUATE THE CONCILIATION PROCEDURE WITH THE MEDIATION PROCEDURE. THESE APPROACHES CLEARLY FOLLOW FROM THE RESOLUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE SETTLED CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) SINCE, BACK IN 1975, THE ECTHR IN ITS DECISION GOLDER V. THE UNITED KINGDOM RULED THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE IMAGINED WITHOUT ACCESS TO JUSTICE. HOWEVER, THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE COURTS ARE THE MAIN INSTITUTION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES CONTINUES TO BE UNDERMINED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION, BOTH AGREEMENT-BASED AND JUDICIAL.
59	THE SPANISH DIGITAL SERVICES TAX CAME INTO FORCE ON 16 JANUARY 2021 AFTER A LONG AND TURBULENT JOURNEY WITH THE AMBITION TO SERVE AS AN INTERIM MEASURE PENDING THE LONG-AWAITED MULTILATERAL SOLUTION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CRITICALLY ANALYSE THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE TAX AND FURTHER REVEAL AND ASSESS THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES THAT ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT ARE LIKELY TO PROMPT, SPECIFICALLY: THE VAGUE DELIMITATION OF SOME OF ITS PROVISIONS WITH THE SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE TO LEGAL CERTAINTY, THE (ALMOST) UNFEASIBLE ACCESS TO THE DATA REQUIRED TO CALCULATE THE RELEVANT TAXABLE REVENUES THAT RENDER THE TAX ULTIMATELY UNWORKABLE, AND THE TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY BE EXPLOITED BY TAXPAYERS TO MINIMIZE THEIR TAX LIABILITIES, INTER ALIA. FINALLY, THE DOUBTFUL CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE DESIGN OF THE TAX AND THE ALLEGED TAX POLICY GUIDELINE BEHIND IT (I.E., THE 'VALUE CREATION' PRINCIPLE) IS ASSESSED ULTIMATELY, THE QUESTION REMAINS OF WHETHER THIS PATH IS GENUINELY WORTH EXPLORING. ARE WE REALLY WILLING TO ENDANGER FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR A TEMPORARY PATCH TARGETING A FEW MULTINATIONALS?
60	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF OUTCOME-BASED EDUCATION (OBE) ON STUDENTS STUDYING HUMAN SERVICES DEGREES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN A POLICING PROGRAM. THIS WORK EXAMINES THE VALIDITY OF THE NOTION THAT OBE IS A PROGRESSIVE TEACHING APPROACH THAT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF A SYSTEMISED OUTCOME-BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACH IS ADOPTED. FINDINGS OBE HAS, AS AN IDEA, SWEPT ACROSS MOST EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN AN APPARENTLY REVOLUTIONARY WAVE. HOWEVER, ANY CRITICAL SCRUTINY OF THIS SYSTEMISED APPROACH TO TEACHING AND LEARNING CALLS INTO QUESTION WHETHER IT IS REALLY PROGRESSIVE OR EMPTY RHETORIC ACHIEVING REACTIONARY ENDS. ANY SYSTEMISED ATTEMPT AT SOCIAL CHANGE BY WAY OF NEO-LIBERAL OUTCOMES THAT ARE NOT PRINCIPLE-DRIVEN WILL SERVE ONLY TO REINFORCE A PHILOSOPHY OF AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION AND INDIVIDUALISM AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL POLICY THAT IS SITUATED ON A SOCIAL CONTRACT FOUNDATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE EFFICACY OF OBE AS A MODEL FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHING, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO HUMAN SERVICES DEGREES SUCH AS POLICING.
61	THE 20TH CENTURY WAS THE MOST INTENSE PERIOD IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN STATE AND CHURCH IN GERMANY. IN 1918, AFTER THE END OF THE IMPERIAL SYSTEM, THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC ENDED THE STATE CHURCH SYSTEM AND ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND COOPERATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. DURING THE NAZI REIGN FROM 1918 TO 1933, THE NAZI ATTEMPTED TO COMPLETELY CONTROL ALL CHURCH AND IDEOLOGICAL FIELDS AND SUFFERED A LOT OF RESISTANCE AND WERE NOT FULLY REALIZED. AFTER THE FOUNDING OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY IN 1919, IT INHERITED THE TRADITION OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. UNDER THE RULE OF LAW OF THE BASIC LAW, THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN POLITICS AND RELIGION WAS FURTHER IMPROVED. AFTER THE TWO GERMAN RCUNIFICATIONS IN 1990,THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS SYSTEM OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY EXTENDED TO THE WHOLE OF GERMANY, AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM RELATIVELY MATURE AND STABLE. HOWEVER, WHEN RELIGION AND SOCIETY ARC INCREASINGLY DIVERSIFIED TODAY, MANY PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES ARC ENCOUNTERED.
62	OUR PAPER AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON REGIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL WELL-BEING INEQUALITIES IN ITALY. WE FIRST DECOMPOSE THE THEIL INDEX IN ITS "WITHIN" AND "BETWEEN" COMPONENTS AND WE FIND THAT DISPARITIES IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL WELL-BEING GO BEYOND THE HISTORICAL GDP DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CENTRE-NORTH AND THE SOUTH OF ITALY: "WITHIN" MULTIDIMENSIONAL WELL-BEING INEQUALITIES RESULT TO BE AS RELEVANT AS INEQUALITIES "BETWEEN" THESE SUB-NATIONAL AREAS, SUGGESTING THAT TERRITORIAL-SPECIFIC FACTORS MAY BE AT WORK. THEN, USING A REGIONAL PANEL IN THE PERIOD 2004-2012, WE ANALYSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MULTIDIMENSIONAL WELL-BEING DISPARITIES AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN TERMS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION. WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MATTER IN AFFECTING REGIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL WELL-BEING INEQUALITIES AND THE EFFECT VARIES HETEROGENEOUSLY ACCORDINGLY TO THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS, AND SPATIAL SPILLOVERS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE LOCAL POLICIES COULD BE BETTER TARGETED TO REDUCE GAPS AND INCREASE EXPENDITURE EFFICIENCY, FOREMOST AMONG WHICH ARE ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIONS AND MEASURES TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REGULATORY INTERVENTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN REGIONS WHICH ARE LAGGING BEHIND.
63	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT DEMOCRACY AND CORRUPTION ARE ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES, THAT IS, VARIABLES THAT ARE RECIPROCALLY CONDITIONED. FURTHERMORE, THEIR BEHAVIOR IS DETERMINED BY OTHER SYSTEMIC VARIABLES USUALLY DIFFICULT TO OBSERVE AND QUANTIFY. CORRUPT PRACTICES HAMPER THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY AND A POORLY CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY GENERATES CORRUPTION. THIS ENDOGENOUS CHARACTER IS THE REASON WHY THE SPECIALIZED LITERATURE IS NOT CONCLUSIVE AS TO WHETHER THERE IS OR NOT A NEGATIVE LINEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND CORRUPTION. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS THESIS, I ANALYZE THE REPRESENTATIVE CASE OF MEXICO. WHILE BOTH IMPUNITY AND CORRUPTION HAVE BEEN CONSTANT IN THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COUNTRY, BOTH HAVE HAD AN EXPONENTIAL AND UNCONTROLLED RISE AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS IN 2000 WHEN THE SINGLE-PARTY REGIME OF STATE ENDED. IN THE CASE OF MEXICO, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT GREATER DEMOCRACY HAS MEANT MUCH MORE CORRUPTION, WHILE CORRUPTION HAS IMPEDED DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. I WILL ANALYZE THE CAUSAL MECHANISMS THAT EXPLAIN THIS, CONCLUDING THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE ONLY VIABLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.
64	WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS IN ITALY, FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, ON THE CREDIT MARKETS AND WE FIND ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS BENEFIT FROM LOWER INTEREST RATES WHEN THE POLITICAL LINK IS AT A LOCAL LEVEL. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THIS PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT IS STRONGER WHEN CONNECTED FIRMS BORROW FROM BANKS WITH POLITICIANS ON THEIR BOARDS AND WHEN THE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY GRANTED TO LOCAL LOAN OFFICERS IS HIGHER. THE LATTER RESULT PROVIDES A NOVEL ADDITION TO THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECTS OF THE DELEGATION OF LENDING DECISIONS WITHIN THE BANK. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE EFFECT IS STRONGER IN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE THE INCIDENCE OF CORRUPTION IS HIGHER. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ON AGGREGATE THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ON INTEREST RATES IS LIMITED BUT IT MAY RISE SIGNIFICANTLY IN SPECIFIC (LOCAL) SITUATIONS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF FACTORS SUCH AS THE DELEGATION OF LENDING DECISIONS, A WEAKER RULE OF LAW AND SOME GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF BANKS.

65	THIS STUDY BEGINS BY REFLECTING ON THE LITERATURE CHARACTERIZING THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF A PROFESSION QUA PROFESSION. IT CONTINUES BY ARGUING THAT BASED UPON COMMONLY USED INDICIA OF A PROFESSION THAT THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN THE US IS DE-PROFESSIONALIZING IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS AND MORPHING TOWARDS A FUNCTIONING BUSINESS MODEL. THE RELATED ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A DEVELOPMENT FOR AMERICAN SOCIETY, ITS LAWYERS AND THEIR CLIENTS, INCLUDING ESPECIALLY CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS ARE CRITICALLY DISCUSSED. IT THEN TRACES THE EMERGENCE AND ASCENDANCY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA AND CORRESPONDING QUEST TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN CHINA AS A PROFESSION. THE STUDY CONCLUDES BY EXPLORING THE ALTERNATIVE ADVANTAGES OF APPLYING THE BUSINESS MODEL TO CHINESE LEGAL PRACTICE. IT RECOMMENDS THAT EMBRACING A PARADIGM SHIFT AWAY FROM THE PROFESSIONAL MODEL TOWARDS A BUSINESS MODEL, COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE US, WOULD BE TO THE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF CHINESE LAWYERS IN TERMS OF ENHANCED AUTHORITY, INCREASED SELF-REGULATION, AS WELL AS PROVIDING GREATER LEVERAGE IN ADVOCATING CLIENT INTERESTS.
66	THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN ITS LISBON I AND II JUDGMENTS REPEATEDLY REFERED TO THE SUPREME STATUS OF THE CONSTITUTION WITHIN THE NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER AFTER THE ACCESSION, WHICH DIDNOT LEAD TO AN IMPLICITE AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AS A GUARDIAN OF SHARED VALUES (RULE OF LAW, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ETC.) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED. HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL CORE" MUST BE PROTECTED AGAINST MISUSE OF COMPETENCE BY THE EUROPEAN UNION BODIES, EVEN WHEN THE LISTING OF VITAL (NON-TRANSFERABLE) STATE FUNCTIONS IS A MATTER OF POLITICAL PROCESS, NOT OF ADJUDICATION. THERE ARE TWO PILLARS OF EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: THE EUROPEAN PARLAMENT AND NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS, BOTH ELECTED DIRECTLY BY UNION CITIZENS. SOVEREIGNTY IN A MODERN STATE IS NOT AN AIM IN ITSELF BASED ON EXCLUSIVITY, BUT A MEANS SERVING THE ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE, CONCENTRATED IN THE POWER TO DISPOSE WITH THE COMPETENCES (TO CONFER). THIS RESTRAINED REASONING OF THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT LARGELY EMANCIPATED IT FROM THE EARLIER "DEPENDENCE" ON THE POSITIONS OF THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
67	IN MOST JURISDICTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN THE CORE INSTRUMENT USED TO IMPLEMENT RULES, REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO FORESTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS APPROACH HAVE RELIED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM FOR REGULATING THROUGH MONITORING AND REPORTING. DESPITE THE OBVIOUS DIFFERENCES IN THE WIDER OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF FORESTRY INTERNATIONALLY, ISSUES RELATED TO GLOBALIZATION HAVE INCREASED THE NEED FOR COMPARISON. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF CERTAIN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES ON THE NATURE OF MONITORING AND INFORMATION REPORTING IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT TO FOREST POLICY AND MANAGEMENT. THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED HERE CONSIDERED DATA ASSOCIATED WITH FORESTRY-RELATED MONITORING AND INFORMATION REPORTING TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVE DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN HARD-LAW REQUIREMENTS IN A SAMPLE OF JURISDICTIONS. THIS WAS DONE TO SHED LIGHT ON THE POTENTIAL FOR COORDINATED MONITORING AND INFORMATION REPORTING OBJECTIVES TO BE MANDATED THROUGH INTER-JURISDICTIONAL HARD LAW. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT FURTHER COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HARD LAW MONITORING AND INFORMATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS COULD FORM A CENTRAL THEME IN DEFINING THE 'GROUND RULES' OF A GLOBAL FOREST LAW.
68	ON THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHERS, JOHN B. RAWLS (1921-2002), IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHORS DEAL WITH HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND FREEDOM WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE FUNDAMENTAL STARTING POINT OF RAWLSS' THEORY, AND THUS OF THIS WORK, IS THAT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE EXPRESSES DISOBEDIENCE TO THE LAW WITHIN THE LIMITS OF FIDELITY TO THE LAW, ALTHOUGH IT IS AT THE OUTER EDGE THEREOF. IF THE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT EXPRESSING DISOBEDIENCE TO UNJUST LAWS IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, THEN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE CAN BE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY AS A CORRECTIVE TO LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY BUT ALSO AS A REALISTIC ATTEMPT TO "SAVE" IT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, CONSIDERING THE INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD DISCOURSE ABOUT THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM IN GENERAL TODAY, AND THE IMPACT OF THAT CRISIS ON THE INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AMONG WHICH THE STATE STANDS OUT, BUT IN FACT LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.
69	AS LARGELY RECOGNIZED, THE STATEMENT THAT "BELIEVERS DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS" BELONGS TO THE PAST, AS TODAY THERE IS A STRONG PRESENCE OF PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES IN THE SOCIOPOLITICAL SPHERE, INCLUDING PARTY POLITICS. HOWEVER, THIS PENTECOSTAL PARTICIPATION OPERATES WITH MANICHEAN CATEGORIES OF THOUGHT, AS WELL AS BASED ON THE NOTION OF "SPIRITUAL BATTLE" AND THE NOTION OF THE DEMONIC, WHICH SOMEHOW DOES NOT HELP IN THE EXERCISE OF CITIZENSHIP. AS A METHODOLOGICAL PATH, WE WILL REFER MAINLY TO THE REFLECTION OF AMOS YONG, AN IMPORTANT PENTECOSTAL THEOLOGIAN WHO HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE INTERFACE BETWEEN PENTECOSTAL FAITH AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THIS ARTICLE DEFENDS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SOCIOPOLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF THE CHURCHES, BUT ALSO THAT ITS IMPROVEMENT INVOLVES THE EXPANSION OF THEIR NOTION OF THE DEMONIC, MAINLY IN THE SOCIOPOLITICAL SPHERE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES NEED TO DEVELOP A THEOLOGICAL ETHICS FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC SPHERE THAT SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY HUMILITY, AWARENESS OF THE PRESENCE OF AMBIGUITY IN THE PENTECOSTAL SETTING AND A POLITICAL AGENDA COMPATIBLE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
70	THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE MODERATING IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FDI AND CO2 EMISSIONS FOR THE CASE OF GOLF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) COUNTRIES AND BY FOCUSING ON A MODERATED MEDIATION MODEL AT TWO STAGES. WE WILL TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOVERNANCE IN THE GCC COUNTRIES AS RESOURCE-ABUNDANT COUNTRIES IS ACTING BETWEEN THE FDI AND THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OR AS A MODERATING FACTOR OF THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY USE ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. IN OUR RESEARCH, WE EXAMINED THE CONDITIONAL EFFECTS OF FDI ON POLLUTION THROUGH ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THE RESULTS FOUND BASED ON FIXED AND VARIABLE EFFECTS MODELS VALIDATE THE POLLUTION HAVEN HYPOTHESIS (PHH) ACCORDING TO OUR MODEL OF THE MODERATED MEDIATION. THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST STAGE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GOVERNANCE MECHANISM FOR CONDITIONING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS ON ENERGY DEMAND, WHILE THE FINDINGS OF THE SECOND STAGE ANALYSIS INDICATED THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE INSTRUMENT TO MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF ENERGY USE ON POLLUTION.
71	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE STRUCTURE OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE VIEW OF THE EFFECT OF ITS COMPONENTS ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN CORRUPT AND NON-CORRUPT BEHAVIOR. FOR MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS, THE RESEARCH SAMPLE WAS COMPRISED OF STUDENTS OF A DEPARTMENTAL INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION SPECIALIZING IN JURISPRUDENCE, EXPERIENCED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AS WELL AS CONVICTS SERVING SENTENCES IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES FOR THE CRIMES THEY HAD COMMITTED (INCLUDING CORRUPTION-RELATED ONES). IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT ONE'S CHOICE OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOR IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE GENERAL LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF ONE'S LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. CONVICTS ARE MORE CHARACTERIZED BY UNDERDEVELOPED MINDSET FOR RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW: THEY YIELD TO CORRUPTION IN SITUATIONS WITH NO OTHER WAY TO RESOLVE THEIR PROBLEM OR IF GIVING A BRIBE FEELS LESS "COSTLY". ESSENTIAL STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOR HAVE BEEN REVEALED: STRONG BELIEF THAT CORRUPTION IS INERADICABLE, ALLOWING ACTS OF BRIBERY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, LEGAL IMMATURITY, MOTIVES TO JUSTIFY SUCH BEHAVIOR, MIXED OR CONTRADICTORY ATTITUDES TOWARDS CORRUPTION. THE GENERAL LEVEL OF ONE'S LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS INFLUENCES ONE'S CHOICE BETWEEN CORRUPT AND NON-CORRUPT BEHAVIOR.
72	DUE TO INNOVATION, PRODUCTIVITY SURGED AND THE STRUCTURE OF EXPORTS SHIFTED TOWARDS SOPHISTICATED PRODUCTS IN RECENT DECADES. IN THIS STUDY, I ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF EXPORT SOPHISTICATION WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE EFFECTS OF DIGITALIZATION FOR 61 COUNTRIES BY EMPLOYING THREE MEASURES OF EXPORT SOPHISTICATION. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT INVESTIGATES THE NEXUS BETWEEN DIGITALIZATION AND SOPHISTICATION. IT IS FOUND THAT EXPORTS GET MORE SOPHISTICATED AS DIGITALIZATION PROMOTES. IN LINE WITH THE LITERATURE, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ACCESS TO CREDIT, AND R&D ARE CONCLUDED TO BE OTHER DRIVERS OF EXPORT SOPHISTICATION. HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE ON TERTIARY ENROLMENT AND FDIS IS MIXED. FINALLY, THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY SEEMS TO HAVE A LIMITED EFFECT ON SOPHISTICATION INDICATING COUNTRIES THAT HAVE AN AUTOCRATIC RULE ALSO HAVE A CHANCE TO SOPHISTICATE THEIR EXPORTS. IN THE LIGHT OF THESE FINDINGS, GOVERNMENTS ARE ADVISED TO IMPROVE PROPERTY RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, ACCESS TO CREDIT, TERTIARY ENROLMENT, AND R&D EXPENDITURES TO SOPHISTICATE THEIR EXPORT BASKETS.
73	THIS STUDY CONSIDERS HOW PARTICIPANTS IN COMMUNITY FORESTRY AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS RESPOND TO FOREST-RELATED VIOLENCE. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RESPONSES SHOULD SEEK TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF VIOLENCE, ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT. YET, THESE RESPONSES ARE OFTEN OBSTRUCTED AND NEUTRALIZED BY POWER RELATIONS AND GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING PERVASIVE CORRUPTION AND PATRIMONIALISM. IN CAMBODIA, THE COMBINATION OF DISTRUST TOWARDS CORRUPT AND ABUSIVE AUTHORITIES, RIGID LEGAL-RATIONAL HIERARCHIES AND SOCIAL CONVENTIONS, AS WELL AS THE BELIEF THAT PATRIMONIALISM SERVES WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND LACK OF AWARENESS OF RIGHTS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEEK, AND EVEN LESS OBTAIN JUSTICE FOR FOREST-RELATED VIOLENCE. FEW COMMUNITIES, SUPPORTING NGOS AND FOREIGN DONORS APPEAR WILLING AND CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING THE ROOTS OF FOREST VIOLENCE, LEADING TO COMPROMISES UNDERMINING CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES, SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE, AND CONTINUED EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND DEFENDERS. THE STUDY POINTS AT FOUR AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF PHYSICAL HARM FOR DEFENDERS, SUSTAIN COMMUNITY CONSERVATION OBJECTIVES, AND STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FOREST VIOLENCE.
74	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF CHINA'S OUTWARD DIRECT INVESTMENT (ODI) ON THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OF THE BELT AND ROAD (B&R) COUNTRIES. BASED ON A PANEL DATA SET OF 63 B&R COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 2003 TO 2016, WE FIND THAT CHINA'S ODI IMPROVES THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OF B&R COUNTRIES NOT ONLY IN THE SHORT RUN BUT ALSO IN THE LONG RUN. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH CHINA'S ODI EXERTS NO DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS ON HOST COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF "CONTROL OF CORRUPTION," "GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS," AND "POLITICAL STABILITY" IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT NATURAL RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS, IT IMPROVES THEIR INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF "REGULATORY QUALITY" AND "RULE OF LAW," IMPLYING THAT CHINA'S ODI MAY HELP THE HOST B&R COUNTRIES MINIMIZE THE "RESOURCE CURSE". AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR CHINA'S OPENING-UP DEVELOPMENT IN THE CURRENT ERA, THE B&R INITIATIVE SERVES AS MEANS TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF B&R COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE CONTRIBUTES TO EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP ON THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF CHINA'S ODI AND SHEDS LIGHT ON THE MECHANISMS THAT DRIVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
75	THE PAPER EXPLORES RUSSIA-RELATED OFFICIAL STATEMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE (EEAS), PRESS RELEASES AND SPEECHES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S TWO HIGH REPRESENTATIVES FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECURITY POLICY POSTED ON THE WEBSITE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF ITS ACTIVITIES (2010-2017). THE GOAL OF THE ANALYSIS IS TO DISTINGUISH THE ELEMENTS OF NORMATIVE, SOFT AND TRANSFORMATIVE POWER IN EU'S OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO MOSCOW AND TO SPECIFY WHAT TYPE OF POWER THE EU TRIES TO EXERCISE IN RUSSIA. QUANTITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS OF THE EEAS DOCUMENTS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE RESULTS OBTAINED DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN DIPLOMATIC SERVICE WITH RUSSIA ARE LIMITED TO A NARROW RANGE OF PROBLEMS. THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS DOMINATE IN THE DIALOGUE OF THE EEAS WITH MOSCOW. CRITICIZING MAINLY VIOLATION OF LEGAL NORMS, THE EUROPEAN EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE POSITIONS ITSELF AS NORMATIVE ACTOR, PROMOTING NORMATIVE AGENDA IN THE COUNTRY. THE ELEMENTS OF SOFT AND TRANSFORMATIVE POWER ARE VERY SCARCELY REPRESENTED.
76	INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS A CONDITION SINE QUA NON OF A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE, STATE POWER RESTS ON THREE SEPARATE ORGANS, NAMELY THE EXECUTIVE, THE LEGISLATURE AND THE JUDICIARY. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH VESTS EXECUTIVE POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE POWER IN THE PARLIAMENT. JUDICIAL POWER IS VESTED IN THE JUDICIARY BOTH BY TRADITION AS WELL AS BY VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE JUDICIARY COMPRISES ALL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, WHICH PERFORMS THE DELICATE TASK OF ENSURING RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY. A SOCIAL STRUCTURE REMAINS LOGICAL AND SOLID WITH THE AID OF A SOUND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE JUDICIARY REDRESSES GRIEVANCES OF THE PEOPLE AND RESOLVES DISPUTES. THE DYSFUNCTION OF JUDICIARY IMPACTS MORE SEVERELY THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER INSTITUTION AS IT REMOVES FROM THE MIND OF PEOPLE THE SENSE OF ATTACHMENT TO SOCIETY. ALTHOUGH THE JUDICIARY WAS INDEPENDENT FOR SOMETIMES AT THE COLONIAL PERIOD, THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION DID NOT WANT TO SEPARATE THE JUDICIARY PERMANENTLY FOR THEIR COLONIAL INTEREST.
77	BETWEEN MAY 1997 AND AUGUST 2006 OVER 3,000 NEW CRIMES AND OFFENCES ENTERED THE STATUTE BOOK EXPANDING THE CRIMINAL LAW EXPONENTIALLY AND INSINUATING CRIMINAL LIABILITY INTO AREAS OF EVERYDAY LIFE PREVIOUSLY UNTOUCHED. THIS UNREMITTING INTENSIFICATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW WHERE OFTEN QUITE RANDOM AND UNRELATED PROVISIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN HUGE, GENERIC AND VIRTUALLY ANNUAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACTS HAS MADE THE LAW INACCESSIBLE AND UNKNOWABLE TO THE PUBLIC, AND UNCERTAIN TO THOSE CHARGED WITH INTERPRETING AND APPLYING IT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PHENOMENON OF ACCRETION IN THE CRIMINAL LAW WITHIN THE LAST DECADE DRAWING ON HISTORICO-LEGAL CONTEXTS, JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORY (PARTICULARLY THE RULE OF LAW), AND CONTEMPORARY ILLUSTRATIONS. IT ARGUES THAT UNCONTROLLED LEGISLATIVE ACCRETION AND A BLOATED STATUTE BOOK MAY INTRODUCE DANGEROUS LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY INTO THE LAW NOT ONLY UNDERMINING ITS INTEGRITY BUT ERODING THE ESSENTIAL MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNED WHICH LEGITIMISES THE AUTHORITY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. THE POLITICAL HOTHOUSE OF SPIN-CYCLE GOVERNMENT HAS SOUGHT TO RELY ON THE CREATION OF NEW LAW AS THE PANACEA TO ALL ILLS BLURRING THE DEMOCRATIC BOUNDARY BETWEEN CITIZEN AND GOVERNMENT.
78	IN THIS EXPLORATION INTO THE CLOSE RELATION BETWEEN TERROR AND LAW, I ATTEMPT FIRST TO SHOW THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN TERROR AND LAW IS NOT A SIMPLE QUESTION OF RELATING VIOLENCE TO LAW, BUT TO THE VERY PROCESS OF CONSTITUTION MAKING. SECOND, LAWS RELATING TO TERROR MAY OR MAY NOT FIND A FORMAL PLACE IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT THIS RELATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE WORKING OF THE BASIC LAW, OF THE FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIRD, INTELLIGENCE GATHERING OCCUPIES A KEY PLACE IN THIS RELATION, AND THIS ACTIVITY, WHICH HAS NO MENTION IN THE CONSTITUTION ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, IS THE FULCRUM ON WHICH REASONS OF STATE STAND. FOURTH, INTELLIGENCE IS THE CLOSE MONITORING OF HUMAN MOVEMENT, OF THE BODY, OF THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND IN THIS PHYSICAL FORM OF POLITICS WE HAVE THE MEETING OF THE BODY AND REASONING, TERROR AND CONSTITUTION, VIOLENCE AND LAW. AND FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES A SPECIFICALLY INDIAN EXPERIENCE; YET MAY HAVE LARGER SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS OF RETRIEVING THE HISTORY OF CONSTITUTION MAKING.
79	THE INVALIDITY OF A CONTRACT IS A SANCTION OF CIVIL LAW. IN A DISPUTE, THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW, ITS EFFECT AND ITS APPLICATION MUST BE APPLIED TOGETHER TO THE CONTRACT IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW. THE MEANS OF DOING SO ARE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND THE APPLICATION OF THE GENERAL CLAUSE. AN ILLEGAL CONTRACT MAY COVER SEVERAL AREAS: CONTRACTS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY, A RULE OF LAW, MORALITY OR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. IN SUCH A COMPLEX LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHICH RULE IS BREACHED AND WHICH RESULTS IN THE INVALIDITY OF THE CONTRACT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVIL LAW AND OTHER RULES IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE USE OF AI, WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE CONTRACTING PARTY OR ADMINISTRATIVE RULES GOVERNING THE USE OF AI. IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT, MANY SECTORAL RULES IMPOSE PROHIBITIONS, MANY NORMS DEFINE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. THE STUDY EXAMINES THE NEW PARADIGM OF THE HUNGARIAN CIVIL CODE OF ILLEGAL CONTRACTS AND FOCUSES THE JUDICIAL PRACTICE OF THE GENERAL CLAUSE OF ILLEGALITY.
80	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE STUDY OF SLOVAKIA AND ITS LACKLUSTER EXPERIENCE WITH A JUDGE-DOMINATED JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO DEMONSTRATE THAT FORMAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ONLY LIMITED IMPACT ON THE IDEATIONAL LEVEL. WE SHOW THAT THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SLOVAK POST-COMMUNIST JUDICIARY RELIED ON THE PRESUMPTION THAT JUDGES' INTERESTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY COMPLEMENTARY TO PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THE MAJORITY OF IMPLEMENTED REFORMS INSULATED THE JUDICIARY FROM THE POLITICAL BRANCHES OF POWER, BUT ALLOWED STRONG HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS INSIDE THE COURTS TO EXIST. IN CONTRAST TO INTERNATIONAL EXPECTATIONS, JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES USED JUDICIAL EMPOWERMENT TO CREATE OR STRENGTHEN COMPETING INFORMAL PRACTICES, WHICH HELPED THEM TO MAXIMIZE THEIR POWER. WE ARGUE THAT THE LACK OF INTERNALIZATION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY INSTITUTIONAL SELF-GOVERNANCE REFORMS FAILED TO TRIGGER CHANGES IN THE PROFESSIONAL ROLE CONCEPTION OF JUDGES IN REGIMES RIDDLED WITH DEEPLY EMBEDDED INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ORDER TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE THAT FUTURE RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS AND DECISIONAL JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH ACTORS INTERNALIZE NEW INSTITUTIONAL INCENTIVES.
81	AS IS WELL KNOWN, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS UNDERSTOOD THAT UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AT THE SERVICE OF UNIVERSITIES, WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE "INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM THAT GUARANTEES AND COMPLETES ITS INDIVIDUAL DIMENSION, CONSTITUTED BY ACADEMIC FREEDOM". THE SUBSEQUENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE HIGH COURT HAS SHAPED A GROWING FREEDOM OF THE UNIVERSITIES WHICH, ON OCCASIONS, HAS BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH THE FREEDOMS (OF RESEARCH, TEACHING) THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT. THIS RESEARCH CRITICALLY EXAMINES THIS JURISPRUDENCE, QUESTIONS THE IRRELEVANCE OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE NATURE IN DETERMINING THE OWNERSHIP AND CONTENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND EXAMINES SOME CURRENT DYSFUNCTIONS CAUSED BY UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY (FOR EXAMPLE, IN ACCESS TO UNIVERSITY TEACHING BODIES). IN VIEW OF THESE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS, IT EXAMINES THE LIMITS OF THE AUTONOMY OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, WHICH MAY DERIVE FROM THE EXISTENCE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, FROM THE VERY DISTRIBUTION OF POWER WITHIN THE UNIVERSITIES, AND FROM THE RULE OF LAW (LINKAGE TO HIGHER LEGAL NORMS, TO THE CONTROLS ESTABLISHED THEREIN AND, IN GENERAL, TO THE COURTS OF JUSTICE).
82	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING THE KEY FACTORS IN THE POLITICAL ELITE BEHAVIOR EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROPAGATION EXEMPLIFIED BY VIETNAM. USING REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND THE CHOW TEST, WE IDENTIFIED THE KEY BEHAVIORAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FIGHT AGAINST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF MORTALITY RATES AND THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY. THE STUDY SAMPLE WAS FORMED BY DATA FROM 67 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE FOR 2020. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY IN A PANDEMIC. THEIR IMPACT ON ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE WORLD LEADERS' GENDER. THE COVID-19 MORTALITY RATE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY INDEX, GENDER, AND CULTURAL FACTORS. BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTED LINEAR MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODELS, WE CALCULATED THE CONTRIBUTION OF SIGNIFICANT FACTORS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMBATING THE PANDEMIC IN VIETNAM, THEIR STIMULATING AND DE-STIMULATING EFFECTS COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE VALUES OF THESE INDICATORS FOR THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES.
83	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE GENERAL LEGAL PROBLEMS OF THE REGULATION OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. PROBLEMS THAT LEAD TO INSUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION ARE IDENTIFIED, WHILE IDENTIFYING DIRECTIONS FOR RESOLVING THEM. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO REVIEW THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS. TO OBTAIN THE RESULTS, A SET OF SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF STUDY OF PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES WERE APPLIED, SUCH AS SYNTHESIS METHODS, COMPARATIVE JURISPRUDENCE, AS WELL AS A FORMAL LEGAL METHOD AND AN ECONOMIC MODELLING METHOD. THE METHOD OF ECONOMIC MODELLING MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH AND AT WHAT COSTS, THE RULE OF LAW HAS PRODUCED THE EXPECTED ECONOMIC EFFECT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL REGULATION IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL LEGAL CATEGORIES AND THAT THE LEGISLATOR IS OBLIGED TO MONITOR EXISTING LEGAL STANDARDS FOR ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
84	MUSLIMS HAVE VENERATED JERUSALEM SINCE THE SEVENTH CENTURY. THEIR DIRECT CONTROL OF THE CITY BEGAN IN 638 AND LASTED, EXCEPT FOR A FEW INTERRUPTIONS, UNTIL 1917. WHEN WE EXAMINE THE EVOLUTION OF AN OFFICIAL MUSLIM ATTITUDE TOWARDS JERUSALEM, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ROLE NOT AS OWNERS OF THE CITY BUT RATHER AS CUSTODIANS. THIS ATTITUDE WAS INFORMED BY THE REALIZATION THAT JERUSALEM WAS SACRED TO MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, AND JEWS ALIKE, AND THAT ALL THREE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES SHARE MANY OF THE SAME SACRED SITES. AS SUCH, STATESMANSHIP AND LAW OBLIGED MUSLIM RULERS TO PROTECT AND DEFEND CHRISTIAN AND JEWISH SACRED SPACES, EVEN AGAINST OCCASIONAL MUSLIM MOB BEHAVIOR THAT CALLED FOR THE DESTRUCTION, CONFISCATION, OR EXCLUSIVE USE OF THOSE PLACES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION IN 2017 TO ENACT THE 1995 DECISION OF THE U.S. CONGRESS TO MOVE THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM STANDS AS A VIOLATION OF THIS HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK AND OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SANCTIONS THE ERADICATION OF PALESTINIAN IDENTITY AND HISTORICAL MEMORY.
85	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF DISABILITY AND ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE WORKPLACE AND THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT AND GUARANTEE ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT IN THIS SOCIAL CONGLOMERATE, SO THAT THEY ENJOY THE SAME WORKING CONDITIONS IS MADE. THE RESEARCH QUESTION FOCUSES ON THAT COLOMBIA NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT PUBLIC POLICIES AIMED AT SATISFYING THE SPECIFIC DISABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF COLOMBIAN SOCIETY NEEDS; WHERE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY RECOGNIZED IN A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMITMENTS MADE BY THE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES RATIFIED BY THE COLOMBIAN STATE IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THE METHODOLOGY USED IS THE HERMENEUTIC METHOD, ANALYZING THE CONCEPT OF DISABILITY AND THE SITUATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IN COLOMBIA, FROM THE VARIOUS THEORETICAL CONCEPTS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY SHOW THAT DISABILITY IS CONSIDERED A SOCIAL PROBLEM, WHICH ENCOURAGES DISCRIMINATION OF PEOPLE IN ALL WALKS OF LIFE, CREATING RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS AND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF THESE WORKERS.
86	DESPITE THE UNDERSTANDABLE ATTENTION DEVOTED SINCE 9/11 TO INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 1 THE CAUSES AND DYNAMICS OF MOST TERRORIST CAMPAIGNS REMAIN PRIMARILY LOCAL. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES A KEY CHALLENGE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS - THE ISSUE OF HOW STATES CAN BEST RESPOND TO NON-STATE TERRORIST INNOVATION - AND IT DOES SO BY FOCUSING ON THE PARTICULAR REALITIES OF, AND POTENTIAL LESSONS FROM, ONE MAJOR NON-STATE TERRORIST INNOVATION: THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY'S (IRA'S) ATTACK ON UK PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER IN 1984. IT IS ARGUED THAT INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES TO TERRORIST INNOVATION WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS LOCAL CASE STUDY WERE HEEDED, AND IF SEVEN INTER-LINKED PRINCIPLES WERE RESPECTED WHEN STATES RESPONDED TO NON-STATE TERRORISM: LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT; WHERE POSSIBLE, ADDRESS UNDERLYING ROOT PROBLEMS AND CAUSES; AVOID THE OVER-MILITARIZATION OF RESPONSE; RECOGNIZE THAT INTELLIGENCE IS THE MOST VITAL ELEMENT IN SUCCESSFUL COUNTER-TERRORISM; RESPECT ORTHODOX LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND ADHERE TO THE DEMOCRATICALLY ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW; COORDINATE SECURITY-RELATED, FINANCIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL PREVENTATIVE MEASURES; AND MAINTAIN STRONG CREDIBILITY IN COUNTER-TERRORIST ARGUMENT.
87	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF EXTRA-LEGAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE INFORMATIVENESS OF CURRENT RETURN ABOUT FUTURE EARNINGS. USING A SAMPLE OF FIRM-LEVEL OBSERVATIONS DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1989 TO 1999 IN EIGHT EAST ASIAN AND ELEVEN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT EXHIBIT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXTRA-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT THE INFORMATIVENESS OF CURRENT RETURN ABOUT FUTURE EARNINGS: (1) DECREASES WITH STRONGER PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION FOR GOOD NEWS FIRMS, (2) INCREASES WITH STRONGER PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION FOR BAD NEWS FIRMS; AND (3) IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS STRONG PRESSURE FROM PUBLIC OPINION. FURTHERMORE, MULTIPLE REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EXTRA-LEGAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES ADD THE INCREMENTAL CONTRIBUTION ABOVE AND BEYOND THE OTHERS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THE ROLE OF EXTRA-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. WHILE CHANGING LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE LEGAL TRADITION, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, OR THE RULE OF LAW, MAY BE COSTLY FOR HISTORICAL OR POLITICAL REASONS, OR BOTH, IMPROVING THE EXTRA-LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IS LIKELY TO BE WELL WITHIN THE RANGE OF FEASIBLE REFORMS.
88	THE FUTURE COURSE OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS DEPEND TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE ON THE PATH RUSSIA TAKES FOLLOWING ITS LIBERATION FROM THE SOVIET SYSTEM. DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND A MARKER ECONOMY, WHICH INITIALLY APPEARED TO BE THE COUNTRY'S NEW IDEALS, ARE NOW CONTROVERSIAL A POLITICAL CULTURE WHICH HAS EVOLVED OVER THE CENTURIES AND WHICH IS CHARACTERISED BY FEATURES WHICH DIFFER TO A LARGE EXTENT FROM THOSE IN THE WEST PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE. THIS NOT ONLY COMPRISES A FORMATIVE RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE, WHICH EMANATED FROM CONSTANTINOPLE - RATHER THAN ROME - AND WHICH ALSO GAVE THE WORLDLY POWER A SPIRITUAL CONSECRATION, ENABLING THE RULERS IN MOSCOW TO DEMAND TOTAL AND UNRESERVED LOYALTY FROM THEIR SUBJECTS RR GERHARD SIMON, DIRECTOR OF STUDIES ON DOMESTIC POLITICS AND STRUCTURES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES IN COLOGNE, EXPLAINS, RUSSIAN TRADITIONS DIFFER IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND WHICH LED TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC-LIBERAL SYSTEM IN THE WEST. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NOW SIGNS OF A WESTERN-STYLE DEVELOPMENT.
89	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO STUDY THE VENICE COMMISSION'S ROLE AS ONE OF THE LEADING INTERNATIONAL LAW INTERPRETERS. THIS ROLE HAS GRADUALLY STRENGTHENED IN THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFICALLY SUBSTANTIATED PROMOTION OF LEGAL NORMS AND STANDARDS CONCERNING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. USING SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL, FORMAL-LEGAL, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, EMPIRICAL, AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL METHODS, ONE HAS DRAWN ESSENTIAL CONCLUSIONS REGARDING IMPLEMENTING THE VENICE COMMISSION'S INTERPRETIVE ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE NATURE OF THE VENICE COMMISSION'S INTERPRETIVE ACTIVITY DEMONSTRATES THE EXISTENCE AND GROWING CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE PREVAILING INTERPRETIVE PRACTICE AT THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF LAW INTERPRETATION. UKRAINE'S ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE VENICE COMMISSION IS VITAL TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE LEGISLATION, ESPECIALLY LAWS, IMPLEMENTING NEW CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ON JUSTICE, THE DRAFTS OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN DESIGNED OR ARE BEING DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS INDUBITABLE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS. VENICE COMMISSION'S GENERAL DOCUMENTS SHOULD BE FOR THE UKRAINIAN LEGISLATOR THE SOURCE TO BASE THE PREPARATION OF RELEVANT LEGISLATION.
90	TAX COMPLIANCE IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE TAX AUTHORITY, INFLUENCING THE BUDGET REVENUE LEVEL. IN THIS STUDY, A VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL (VECM) ANALYSIS WAS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMPLIANCE IN INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXATION (TAXPAYER'S BEHAVIOR), PUBLIC TRUST IN POLITICIANS (TRUST IN AUTHORITIES), AND RULE OF LAW (POWER OF THE AUTHORITIES), USING UNBALANCED PANEL DATA FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU28) DURING THE 2007-2017 PERIOD. THE RESULTS UNDERLINE THE CAUSALITY OF THE LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE VARIABLES. THE RESULTS OF THE VECM ANALYSIS UNDERLINE THE NEED FOR VARIOUS SUPPORT MEASURES FOR VOLUNTARY TAX COMPLIANCE, WITH THE TRUST VARIABLE HAVING AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON TAX COMPLIANCE. IN ADDITION, A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM) ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED USING AN IMPROVED DATA SET WITH VARIABLES SUCH AS THE COMPLIANCE IN CORPORATION TAXATION (TAXPAYER'S BEHAVIOR), WASTEFULNESS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING, AND QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE RESULTS OF THE SEM ANALYSIS UNDERLINE THE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES OF THE VARIABLES ON TAX COMPLIANCE.
91	THE RUGGIE PRINCIPLES HAVE GIVEN NEW IMPULSE TO THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND MODERNIZING INTERNATIONAL LAW THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS "SOFT LAW" MEASURES INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACTIVITIES OF MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES, WHICH ACADEMIC OPINION DEEMS HAS LESSENED THE CAPACITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR TRANSFORMING INTERNATIONAL LAW INTO MORE EFFECTIVE AND TRULY BINDING INSTRUMENTS TO AVOID ABUSES AGAINST HUMAN DIGNITY. THIS ISSUE HAS PROMPTED A DEBATE CONCERNING THE ROLE OF MULTINATIONALS AS SUBJECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE ADVISABILITY OF RETURNING TO MORE TRADITIONAL AND CONSERVATIVE APPROACHES TO GOVERNANCE OF GLOBALIZATION AND TO EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS FROM RISKY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THANKS TO COMMON LAW TRADITIONS, THIS MODEL MAY BE TRANSFORMED INTO BINDING RULES, USING THE LEGAL TOOLS OF PRIVATE LAW. THIS REVEALS THE UTILITY OF SUCH SOFT LAW REGULATIONS IN CREATING CULTURES OF RESPECT USEFUL WHEN RULE OF LAW IS WEAK TO RULE RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES, COMPANIES AND PEOPLE, THAT ARISE FROM THE ACTIONS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS RATHER THAN THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC LAW-MAKING INSTITUTIONS.
92	THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER THE IMPACT OF THE LIMITATION OF A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE ON ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANK REVENUE EFFICIENCY BY USING DATA FROM THE COUNTRIES OF THREE REGIONS. NON-PARAMETRIC DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) EMPLOYED TO MEASURE THE BANK REVENUE EFFICIENCY LEVEL THE APPLIED METHOD OF ESTIMATION CONSISTS OF POOLED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (OLS), FIXED EFFECT MODEL (FEM), RANDOM EFFECT MODEL (REM), AND THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE AND OTHER POTENTIAL DETERMINANTS ON BANK EFFICIENCY. THIS STUDY FINDS OUT THAT THE DIMENSIONS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCED ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANK REVENUE EFFICIENCY, HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION PROVIDED THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP. FURTHERMORE, OTHER DIMENSIONS OF REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE WITH THE CONVENTIONAL BANK REVENUE EFFICIENCY. IMPLICATIONS FROM THE STUDY ALLOW THE RELATED PARTIES TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNIFICANT DIMENSIONS OF A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE BANKS TO ENSURE BETTER BANK PERFORMANCE.
93	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW TERRORISM AFFECTS GOVERNANCE IN 53 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1998-2012. FOUR TERRORISM INDICATORS ARE USED NAMELY: DOMESTIC, TRANSNATIONAL, UNCLEAR, AND TOTAL TERRORISM. TEN BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE ALSO EMPLOYED NAMELY: POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY), ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (ENCOMPASSING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY); INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW), AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE. THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE BUNDLED BY MEANS OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS. THREE KEY FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, ALL SELECTED TERRORISM DYNAMICS NEGATIVELY AFFECT POLITICAL GOVERNANCE AND ITS CONSTITUENTS. SECOND, EVIDENCE OF A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP IS SPARINGLY APPARENT IN ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND ITS COMPONENTS. THIRD, NO PROOF WAS CONFIRMED IN RELATION TO THE IMPACT OF TERRORISM AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE WITH ITS ELEMENTS. FOURTH, COMPARED WITH DOMESTIC TERRORISM, TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM MORE NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND GENERAL GOVERNANCES. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.

94	FOR THE PAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) FLOWS HAVE GROWN EXPONENTIALLY ACROSS THE WORLD. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAS, HOWEVER, LAGGED BEHIND AND ONLY LURED ON AVERAGE A MERE 2 PER CENT OF GLOBAL FDI. THE INVESTMENT THAT THE REGION ATTRACTS TENDS, MOREOVER, TO BE CONCENTRATED IN A NUMBER OF COMMODITY-RICH COUNTRIES. NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE SIZE OF NATIONAL MARKETS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE MAIN DRIVERS OF FDI. THE QUALITY OF LOCAL INSTITUTIONS HAS, BY CONTRAST, ATTRACTED LESS ATTENTION. THIS PAPER USES INSTITUTIONAL DATA FOR 22 COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE PLAYS A FAR FROM NEGLIGIBLE AND ENDURING ROLE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FDI IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. IT IS SHOWN THAT FACTORS SUCH AS POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, LOWER CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW NOT ONLY ARE MORE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF FDI THAN THE SIZE OF LOCAL MARKETS, BUT ALSO THAT THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE CAPACITY OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO ATTRACT FDI IS LONG-LASTING.
95	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE MODAL VERB SHALL IN ENGLISH LEGAL DISCOURSE. THE ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL AND FACTUAL DATA SHOWS THAT SHALL PERFORMS A NUMBER OF SEMANTIC FUNCTIONS IN LEGAL TEXTS THAT VIOLATE THE MAIN DRAFTING REQUIREMENTS CLARITY, PRECISION, LACK OF AMBIGUITY OF LEGAL UTTERANCES. LEXICAL UNITS AND GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS WITH AMBIGUOUS MEANINGS OBSCURE LEGAL PROVISIONS FOR LAY PERSONS, SO THEIR USE GOES AGAINST ONE OF THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW EQUITABLE ACCESS TO LEGAL INFORMATION FOR ALL CITIZENS, NOT ONLY FOR LEGAL EXPERTS. FURTHERMORE, THE AMBIGUITY OF LINGUISTIC UNITS INVOLVES CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES FOR LEGAL TRANSLATORS AS THEY NEED TO HAVE DEEP LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO INTERPRET UNCLEAR INTENTIONS OF LEGISLATORS. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THREE APPROACHES DEVELOPED IN LAW-MAKING PRACTICE TO THE USE OF SHALL IN LEGAL DOCUMENTS: RESTRICTING SHALL TO ONE SENSE, AVOIDANCE OF SHAL, AND KEEPING THE VERB WITH ALL ITS EXISTING MEANINGS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IN LEGAL DISCOURSE SHALL MAY BE REPLACED BY OTHER MODAL VERBS MAY, MUST, SHOULD, HE TO WITH LESS AMBIGUOUS MEANINGS.
96	DO CUSTOMARY COURTS STRATEGICALLY ADAPT ARBITRATION OUTCOMES IF THEY FACE INCREASED COMPETITION BY THE FORMAL LAW? THROUGH A LAB-IN-FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH VILLAGERS AND REAL CUSTOMARY JUDGES IN RURAL ETHIOPIA, WE SHOW THAT POST-ARBITRATION PAYOUTS TO AGENTS DISFAVORED BY THE CUSTOMARY SYSTEM ARE DOWNWARDLY BIASED. INTRODUCING A COSTLY FORMAL LAW REDUCES THESE BIASES AND DRAWS THE DECISIONS OF CUSTOMARY JUDGES SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER TO THE LAW. AT THE SAME TIME AGENTS ADVANTAGED BY THE LAW DO NOT EXPLOIT THEIR INCREASED BARGAINING POWER. INSTEAD, THEY MAKE OFFERS THAT ARE LESS ADVANTAGEOUS TO THEMSELVES AND, IN EQUILIBRIUM, ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM MAKE DIRECT USE OF THE FORMAL LAW. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LOCAL CUSTOMARY DISPUTE RESOLUTION INSTITUTIONS MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN SHIFTING PREEXISTING CUSTOMS TOWARD A DESIRED OUTCOME. IN AREAS WHERE FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE LIMITED OUTREACH, THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED COMPETITION BETWEEN FORMAL LAW AND CUSTOMARY LEGAL INSTITUTIONS MAY RISE FROM CHANGES IN THE LATTER, RATHER THAN FROM PLAINTIFFS SEEKING JUSTICE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.

97	THE UK AND MANY OTHER SOCIETIES OPERATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, MEANING SIMPLY THAT VARIOUS FORMS OF, OFTEN HIGHLY FORMAL, DECISION MAKING ARE PRESENT. PSYCHOLOGY AS A PROFESSION AND PSYCHOLOGISTS AS INDIVIDUALS HAVE A POTENTIALLY KEY ROLE IN ASSISTING SUCH DECISION MAKING AND DOING SO IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE. THE EARLY HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY IS REPLETE WITH EXAMPLES OF SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS VARIOUS TYPES OF INJUSTICE MAY FOLLOW. IT IS THEREFORE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT HIGH-QUALITY AND EVIDENCE-BASED OPINION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO INFORM LEGAL DECISION MAKING. YET THIS IS ALSO AN AREA THAT PROVOKES PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL ANXIETY. THE SCRUTINY, OFTEN PUBLIC, OF BELIEFS, PRACTICE AND THE BASIS FOR THESE MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE. THERE ARE, THOUGH, CLEAR BENEFITS FOR PSYCHOLOGY AS A DISCIPLINE AND FOR INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN CONTRIBUTING MORE ACTIVELY TO SUCH WORK. SUCH SCRUTINY MAY SERVE TO DRIVE UP PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN LEGAL DECISION MAKING MAY DRIVE THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION OF PSYCHOLOGY AS A DISCIPLINE.
98	GENUINE SAVING IS A MEASURE OF NET INVESTMENT IN PRODUCED, NATURAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL. IT IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR WEAK SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THAT GENUINE SAVING NOT BE PERSISTENTLY NEGATIVE. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO DATA PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK, RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY FAILING TO MEET THIS CONDITION. ALONGSIDE THE WELL-KNOWN RESOURCE CURSE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, RESOURCE ABUNDANCE MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GENUINE SAVING. IN FACT, THE TWO ARE CLOSELY RELATED, AS FUTURE CONSUMPTION GROWTH IS LIMITED BY INSUFFICIENT GENUINE SAVING NOW. IN THIS PAPER, WE APPLY THE MOST CONVINCING CONCLUSION FROM THE LITERATURE ON ECONOMIC GROWTH - THAT IT IS INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE THAT DEPRESSES GROWTH - TO DATA ON GENUINE SAVING. WE REGRESS GROSS AND GENUINE SAVING ON THREE INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN INTERACTION WITH AN INDICATOR OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE. THE INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ARE CORRUPTION, BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THAT REDUCING CORRUPTION HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON GENUINE SAVING IN INTERACTION WITH RESOURCE ABUNDANCE. THAT IS, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ON GENUINE SAVING IS REDUCED AS CORRUPTION IS REDUCED.
99	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). TO THIS END, WE EMPLOYED A PANEL DATA ANALYSIS ACROSS 41 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2020. WE USED A TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES (2SLS) ESTIMATION METHOD TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY ISSUES. WE FOUND THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENHANCING FDI INFLOWS IN SSA. SPECIFICALLY, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CERTAIN DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, SUCH AS THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON FDI INFLOWS IN SSA. CONVERSELY, COMPONENTS OR DIMENSIONS LIKE SOUND MONEY AND REGULATION HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT. FREEDOM TO TRADE HAS A POSITIVE SIGN ON FDI. REGARDLESS, THESE EFFECTS ARE STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. BASED ON THESE OUTCOMES, SSA COUNTRIES SHOULD PRIORITIZE CONSOLIDATING PUBLIC SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK BY ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW AND A FUNCTIONAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARDS THE RIGHTS OF INVESTORS IS ALSO NECESSARY.
100	JUDGES LIKE TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE IMPARTIAL DECISION-MAKERS FULLY CAPABLE OF SUPPRESSING THEIR PERSONAL PROCLIVITIES, AS THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES. BUT A CENTURY'S WORTH OF STUDIES UNDERMINES THAT VIEW. GOING UNDER THE NAME 'JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR', THIS VAST LITERATURE SHOWS THAT MANY EXTRANEOUS (NON-LEGAL) FACTORS AFFECT THE CHOICES JUDGES MAKE. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON ONE STRAND OF THAT LITERATURE - THE EFFECT OF PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS ON JUDGING, WITH EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL IDENTITY AND SOCIAL DIVERSITY. WE SHOW THAT THE LITERATURE IS BIFURCATED: STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE SOCIAL IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGES (SUCH AS THEIR GENDER, RACE, AND NATIONALITY) GENERATE FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH IN-GROUP BIAS, WHEREAS RESEARCH ON THE SOCIAL DIVERSITY OF JUDGES SITTING IN PANELS SUGGESTS THAT BENEFITS CAN ACCRUE FROM SOCIALLY DIVERSE COURTS. WHAT THE TWO SETS OF STUDIES HAVE IN COMMON, THOUGH, IS JUST AS IMPORTANT: BOTH COULD MAKE PROFOUND ACADEMIC AND POLICY CONTRIBUTIONS BUT REQUIRE FAR MORE DEVELOPMENT IF THEY ARE TO REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL. WE OFFER PROPOSALS FOR FORWARD MOVEMENT.
101	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSION ON SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS AND EXTRACTIVE PROJECTS IN THE ARCTIC REGION. FIFTY-THREE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS ARE ANALYSED, USING DATA FROM THE GLOBAL ATLAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. BASED ON DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, REGRESSION AND NETWORK ANALYSIS, THE PAPER REVEALS THAT SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS PREDOMINANTLY OVERLAP WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' TERRITORIES, FROM WHICH A TRANSVERSAL OPPOSITION TAKES PLACE, INCLUDING INDIGENOUS, NON-INDIGENOUS AND INTERNATIONAL ACTORS ALIKE. THE MAIN COMMODITIES INVOLVED IN THESE CONFLICTS ARE RELATED TO FOSSIL FUELS, METALS, AND TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. ASSOCIATED LARGE-SCALE EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES ARE BRINGING NEGATIVE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AT THE EXPENSE OF INDIGENOUS GROUPS, FISHERMEN, AND PASTORALISTS, WITH LOSS OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES BEING SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN INDIGENOUS TERRITORIES OF HIGH BIO-CULTURAL VALUES ASSOCIATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT REPRESSION AGAINST ACTIVISTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ABSENCE OF PREVENTIVE MOBILIZATION, AND IN ARCTIC COUNTRIES WITH LOW RULE OF LAW. THE CHANCES TO ACHIEVE THE CANCELLATION OF A CONFLICTIVE EXTRACTIVE PROJECT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IF DEPENDENCY ON NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS IN A COUNTRY IS LOW.
102	RAPID GROWTH IN LARGE EMERGING ECONOMIES HAS BEEN SPREAD UNEQUALLY ACROSS THEIR REGIONS LEADING TO GROWING INCOME DISPARITIES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DISTRIBUTION OF REGIONAL OUTPUT PER CAPITA AND THE EVOLUTION OF ITS SHAPE IN BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, AND RUSSIA FROM THE MID-1990S TO THE MID-2010S. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CONVERGENCE IS CONDUCTED USING A NONPARAMETRIC METHODOLOGY. THE RESULTS REVEAL DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICS ACROSS THE FOUR ECONOMIES. CHINESE REGIONS WITH BELOW-MEDIAN OUTPUT PER CAPITA HAVE THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF TRANSITIONING TOWARD HIGHER-INCOME LEVELS, WHILE THEIR BRAZILIAN COUNTERPARTS ARE TRAPPED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DISTRIBUTION. ALTHOUGH INDIA HAS THE LOWEST AND RUSSIA ONE OF THE HIGHEST REGIONAL INCOME INEQUALITIES, THEY DISPLAY SIMILAR DIVERGENCE PATTERNS EXEMPLIFIED BY HIGH PERSISTENCE AT BOTH ENDS OF THE DISTRIBUTION. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE MAJOR DRIVING FORCES BEHIND REGIONAL CONVERGENCE, EXCEPT IN RUSSIA WHERE THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. INNOVATION AND PROPERTY RIGHTS ALSO PROMOTE CONVERGENCE IN CHINA, BUT CAUSE REGIONAL DIVERGENCE IN INDIA.
103	"ILLIBERALISM" HAS ASSUMED AN INVIGORATED IF UNANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. ASPECTS OF ILLIBERALISM POPULATE NOT ONLY STATES LONG KNOWN AS INDIFFERENT TO SUCH PRINCIPLES AS PERSONAL LIBERTY, HUMAN EQUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW BUT HAVE EXPANDED IN "LIBERAL" DEMOCRACIES AS THEIR RULERS EMPLOY PURPORTEDLY "ILLIBERAL" PRACTICES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IN THE RECENT PAST. INDEED, THE TERM "ILLIBERAL" SEEMS TO HAVE LOST ITS NEGATIVE AURA IN THE CONTEXT OF STATE ACTION. WE CONTEND THAT ILLIBERALISM REPRESENTS EITHER AN OPPOSITION TO PROCEDURAL DEMOCRATIC NORMS-AS DISRUPTIVE ILLIBERALISM-OR AN IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE-TERMED IDEOLOGICAL ILLIBERALISM. WE FIRST DISCUSS THE TERM AS USED IN THE VAST LITERATURE ON REGIME TYPES IN THE DEBATE ON AUTHORITARIAN/DEMOCRATIC HYBRID-REGIMES. WE THEN TURN TO THE KEY PUZZLE IN WHAT ONE MAY CALL "ILLIBERALISM STUDIES": THE RISE OF ILLIBERAL PRACTICES AND POLICIES IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. TO INFORM OUR ANALYSIS EMPIRICALLY, WE INVESTIGATE THE WAYS IN WHICH ILLIBERAL ARGUMENTS AND INSTITUTIONS (NOTABLY CAMPS) WERE DEPLOYED HISTORICALLY AND IN IMMIGRATION POLICY. WE CONCLUDE WITH AN EXAMPLE OF ILLIBERAL POLICY FROM MODERN DAY HUNGARY.
104	USING A DATASET OF 7757 FIRMS IN BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA, AND RUSSIA FROM 2009 TO 2014, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL RISK VARIABLES ON FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY ON FUTURE FIRM VALUE, CAPITAL INVESTMENT, CASH HOLDINGS AND THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT WHILE CONTROLLING FOR FIRM LEVEL EFFECTS AND POLITICAL VARIABLES. EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION OF THE MAJORITY IS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY ON FIRM VALUE, RESULTS THAT ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ARE FOUND. HOWEVER, UNLIKE PREVIOUS WORK, THE CURRENT RESEARCH DOES NOT FIND THAT INCREASED FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY LEADS TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IT IS FOUND THAT FINANCIALLY FLEXIBLE FIRMS IN THESE COUNTRIES LOWER THEIR PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ON AVERAGE BY ABOUT 0.6 %. IT IS ALSO FOUND THAT GIVING GREATER VOICE TO THE MAJORITY AND GREATER ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW ADDS TO THE VALUE OF FIRMS. (C) 2020 BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS.

105	POSTMODERN INTELLECTUALS OFTEN SUGGEST THAT TRUTH IS BASED ON A SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF REALITY BECAUSE TRUTH IS DETERMINED BY THE FRAMEWORK (DISCOURSE, IDEOLOGY, PARADIGM, THEORY,.) THAT ONE USES. THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT BY FRAMING REALITY IN A SPECIFIC WAY, A DOMINANT CLASS DETERMINES HOW THE TRUTH WILL BE PERCEIVED. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION WE SHOW THAT, IN THE CONTEXT OF A SHARED COMMITMENT, A FRAMEWORK CANNOT EASILY BE MANIPULATED AND THAT BEING TRUTHFUL IS UNMISTAKABLY IMPORTANT. IN THEIR REASONING ABOUT TRUTH, PHILOSOPHERS OFTEN TAKE AN OBJECTIFYING ATTITUDE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY MAKE AN ABSTRACTION OF WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THE CONTEXT OF A JOINT COMMITMENT. THIS RESULTS IN A MISINTERPRETATION OF THE RELEVANCE OF TRUTH. WHAT PEOPLE AGREE ON FORMS THE BASIS OF WHAT THEY ESTABLISH, THINK, HOPE, PLAN, AND DO AS A GROUP. WITHOUT SUFFICIENT COMMON GROUND, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH IN A SOCIETY A JOINT COMMITMENT TO RESPECT WHAT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS IS WHY TRUTH REALLY MATTERS.
106	AFTER HAVING DECIDED THE OBJECTIVE OF INDEPENDENCE, THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN FAVOUR OF THIS OBJECTIVE HAD TO FIND A WAY HOW TO ARTICULATE THEIR ASPIRATIONS. SINCE THERE IS NO LEGAL WAY WITHIN THE NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT BASED THEIR DEMANDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE BY BUILDING THE SO-CALLED RIGHT TO DECIDE. HOWEVER THIS RIGHT TO DECIDE MEANS TO LIMIT THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE TO A SINGLE ELECTORAL ACT, WITH UNILATERALLY ESTABLISHED RULES AND OUTSIDE THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK. IN THIS ARTICLE WE TRY TO DISPROVE BOTH THE SUPPOSED OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, AS WELL AS THE SUPPOSED DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT OF THE RIGHT TO DECIDE. ALONG WITH THIS, WE WILL ARGUE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONSTITUTIONALISE THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION. THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION IS OPPOSED TO THE ESSENCE OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, MOREOVER THE DIFFICULTIES OF SETTING THE CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS RIGHT, AND PARTICULARLY, THE DEFINITION OF THE SUBJECT, MAKES THE APPLICATION IMPOSSIBLE.
107	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE REASONS DRIVING THE FEMINIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN JUDICIARY, REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT 66 % OF RUSSIAN JUDGES ARE WOMEN. RELYING ON DATA FROM RESEARCH INTO THE RUSSIAN JUDICIARY CONDUCTED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND USING A GENDER APPROACH IN THE STUDY OF ORGANIZATIONS, THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED THAT ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN FEMALE DOMINATION IN THE JUDICIARY IS THE INFLUENCE OF RECRUITING PRACTICES. A TWO-STAGE RECRUITING MODEL, IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF JUDGES ARE SELECTED FROM THE COURT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS ITSELF MAINLY MADE UP OF WOMEN, EXPLAINS THIS GENDER IMBALANCE. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE RUSSIAN JUDICIARY CAN BE SEEN AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL FEMINIZATION, ESPECIALLY AS THIS HAS OCCURRED WITHOUT A DECLINE IN THE PRESTIGE OF THE JUDICIAL PROFESSION. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH ALLOW NEW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF FEMINIZATION ON BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORKING IN THIS PROFESSIONAL AREA, AS WELL AS SHEDDING LIGHT ON CHANGES THAT FEMALE JUDGES MAY BRING TO THE RUSSIAN JUDICIARY.
108	SCHOLARS OFTEN ASSUME THAT SOME ISSUES GLOBALLY EVOKE MORAL REACTIONS, WHETHER THESE ISSUES ARE PRESENTED AS MORAL DILEMMAS (E.G., TROLLEY PROBLEMS) OR AS CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES OF THE DAY (E.G., THE LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTION). THERE IS CONSIDERABLE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION, HOWEVER, IN THE DEGREE THAT PEOPLE REPORT THAT THEIR POSITION ON SPECIFIC ISSUES REFLECTS A CORE MORAL CONVICTION. THIS CHAPTER REVIEWS THEORY AND RESEARCH THAT EXPLORES THE ROLE MORAL CONVICTION PLAYS IN PREDICTING PEOPLE'S POLITICAL THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, AND BEHAVIOR. VARIANCE IN MORAL CONVICTION ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC ISSUES HAS IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS PREDICTING INCREASED POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT (VOTING, WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVISM), INOCULATION AGAINST THE USUAL PRESSURES TO OBEY AUTHORITIES AND THE LAW, AND GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF VIOLENT SOLUTIONS TO CONFLICT. THE NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE AND OTHER FINDINGS ARE BOTH REASSURING (MORAL CONVICTION CAN PROTECT AGAINST OBEDIENCE TO POTENTIALLY MALEVOLENT AUTHORITIES) AND TERRIFYING (MORAL CONVICTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH REJECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CAN PROVIDE A MOTIVATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR VIOLENT PROTEST AND ACTS OF TERRORISM).
109	THIS ARTICLE IS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE RIGHTS PROVIDED FOR BY ARTICLE 47 OF THE CHARTER, THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. IT IS NOT A NEW CONTRIBUTION OF THE CHARTER BUT A GUARANTEE WHICH HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY EU LAW FOR DECADES. IT FIRST APPEARED AS A PROCEDURAL RIGHT, WAS LATER RECOGNIZED AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF THE EU AND WAS FINALLY EMBODIED IN THE CHARTER. CONSEQUENTLY THIS WORK RECALLS THAT PROCESS OF RECOGNITION, PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE JUDICIAL REMEDIES PROVIDED BY EU LAW AND TO SOME SPECIFIC RULES OF SECONDARY - COMPETITION-LAW WHICH AFFECT THE CONTEXT ON WHICH THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS DEVELOPED. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY UNDERLINING, ON THE ONE HAND, THE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS LEGAL PROCESS AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, A FEW GAPS ON THE ISSUE WHICH ARE NEITHER RECENT NOR CONSISTENT WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPLETENESS OF SUCH RIGHT AS IT IS REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW TRADITION.
110	THAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PUBLIC BODIES CAN BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES WHEN THEY INDUCE AND THEN FRUSTRATE PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS IS AN IMPORTANT AND DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN EUROPE. THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT TO ESTABLISH A SET OF MORAL PRINCIPLES AND IDEALS THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY THIS LEGAL INSTITUTION. THE NOTION OF SECURITY OF EXPECTATIONS FOUND IN THE WORK OF UTILITARIAN WRITERS PROVIDES A STARTING POINT. HAVING EXAMINED THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THIS APPROACH, I THEN TURN TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE ARGUMENT BASED ON FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS. FINALLY, I LOOK FOR SUITABLE MORAL ARGUMENTS IN THE LIBERAL AND KANTIAN POLITICAL THEORISING OF JOHN RAWLS. I ARGUE THAT IF WE SEE THE FUNCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS NOT MERELY TO MAXIMISE AGGREGATE UTILITY AND TO MAKE POLICYMAKERS' DECISIONS SEEM CREDIBLE BUT ALSO TO ENSURE JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS FOR INDIVIDUALS, THEN THIS PROVIDES A MORE ROBUST AND SATISFACTORY WAY TO JUSTIFY THE LIABILITY OF PUBLIC BODIES FOR LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS THEY INDUCE AND THEN FRUSTRATE.
111	THE "MERE PARCHMENT BARRIERS" CREATED BY CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS MAY LEAD TO DECREASES IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH NATIONS ABUSE THE HUMAN RIGHT NOT TO BE IMPRISONED, TORTURED, KILLED, OR MADE TO DISAPPEAR ARBITRARILY OR BECAUSE OF YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS. A GLOBAL POOLED CROSS-NATIONAL TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS FOR A 21-YEAR PERIOD SHOWS THAT ADOPTING SELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, PROMOTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND GUARDING AGAINST STATES OF EMERGENCY-AND KEEPING THE PROVISIONS IN PLACE FOR 10 YEARS-HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE A NATION'S LEVEL OF STATE TERROR SUBSTANTIALLY, FROM ONE IN WHICH POLITICAL IMPRISONMENT AFFECTS LARGE NUMBERS OF THE POLITICALLY ACTIVE POPULATION AND POLITICAL MURDERS ARE COMMON, TO ONE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS SECURE, FOR EXAMPLE. WE REPORT SIGNIFICANT CAVEATS ABOUT AND LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH. NEVERTHELESS, WE CONCLUDE THAT, SINCE IT MAY BE EASIER TO CHANGE CONSTITUTIONS THAN TO BUILD EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY, TO CREATE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF NEW WEALTH, OR TO AVOID OR DEFUSE DEEPLY INGRAINED CONFLICTS, THESE FINDINGS HAVE POSSIBLE POLICY AND SCIENTIFIC IMPORTANCE.
112	JAMES THORNWELL, THE GREAT PRESBYTERIAN THEOLOGIAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, IS OFTEN LINKED WITH THE CAUSE OF SECESSION AND THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA. A CAREFUL READING OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES INDICATES, HOWEVER, THAT HE WAS PRIMARILY A I UNIONIST. HE WAS, IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT NINETEENTH-CENTURY CHAMPIONS OF THE VIRTUES OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1787 AND THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC THAT IT CREATED. THORNWELL WROTE IN FAVOR OF THE AINERICAN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AS IT WAS ENSHRINED IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S PROVISIONS REGARDING DISESTABLISHMENT AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION. HE THUS DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM THE REFORMATION MODEL AND THE EUROPEAN ARRANGEMENTS OF HIS TIME, FAVORING JAMES MADISON'S IDEAL OF CHURCH/STATE SEPARATION OVER JOHN CALVIN'S PRINCIPLE OF ESTABLISHED RELIGION UPHELD BY RULE OF LAW. HIS LOVE FOR THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL THOUGHT IMBEDDED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IS REFLECTED IN HIS LOVE FOR REPUBLICANISM, HIS EMBRACE OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION, AND IN HIS PREACHING OF REPENTANCE LEST THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC COLLAPSE UNDER THE CHASTENING HAND OF GOD.
113	GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AND SUBSTANTIAL EXTERNAL RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED OVER THE COURSE OF DECADES, HAVE NEITHER ELIMINATED BROAD POVERTY NOR RESULTED IN EQUITABLE INCOME DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE POORER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE DEVELOPMENT FAILURES WITH REFERENCE TO NIETZSCHEAN BEHAVIOR WHERE THE STRONG ACT WITHOUT ETHICAL RESTRAINT AND THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT PROTECT THE WEAK. WHILE NIETZSCHEAN BEHAVIOR VIOLATES PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, THERE ARE ALSO INEFFICIENCIES. THE NIETZSCHEAN STRONG WHO RULE HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO ADOPT EFFICIENCY-ENHANCING POLICIES. EFFICIENCY IN A NIETZSCHEAN SOCIETY IS ALSO GREATER, THE HIGHER THE LEISURE PREFERENCE OF THE WEAK AND THE LESS THE WEAK ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING. LABOR PRODUCTIVITY IS LOW BECAUSE THE WEAK DO NOT CONSISTENTLY WORK. THESE ARE THE OUTCOMES WHEN THE STRONG BEHAVE AS ROVING BANDITS. WHEN THE STRONG BEHAVE AS STATIONARY BANDITS, EFFICIENCY IS ENHANCED BUT INCOME DISTRIBUTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN UNEQUAL. THE NIETZSCHEAN PERSPECTIVE ON DEVELOPMENT FAILURE IS COMPARED WITH ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE SUSTAINED PLIGHT OF THE POOR IN POOR COUNTRIES AND THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND WEALTH.
114	THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN EMPOWERING EMERGING SEVEN (E-7) ECONOMIES FOR A LOW-CARBON FUTURE. IT ANALYZES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ENERGY PRO-DUCTIVITY, NATURAL RESOURCE RENT, AND THEIR IMPACT ON CONSUMPTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS EMPLOYING THE METHOD OF MOMENT QUANTILE REGRESSION (MMQR). THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN MITI-GATING CO2 EMISSIONS ACROSS QUANTILES BY COMBATING CORRUPTION AND UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCE RENT ALLOWS DIVERSIFICATION FROM CARBON-INTENSIVE SECTORS AND REDUCES CARBON EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON CARBON EMISSIONS AS E-7 ECONOMIES IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND ADOPT CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESULTS FOR GDP SHOW A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH EMISSIONS, WHILE RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT, STRESSING THE IMPOR-TANCE OF CLEAN ENERGY PROMOTION. POLICYMAKERS IN E-7 ECONOMIES CAN FURTHER STRIDE TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT BY IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ENHANCING ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY, AND UTILIZING NATURAL RESOURCE RENT TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH.
115	IN RECENT YEARS, TOURISM HAS EMERGED AS A KEY DRIVER OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS COUNTRIES ARE INCREAS-INGLY PROACTIVE IN IMPROVING GOVERNANCE STANDARDS TO ENHANCE TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN TOURISTS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE NEXUS BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN THE US DURING 2008-2019 USING THE CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORM METHOD AND MAXIMAL OVERLAP DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM METHOD TO EXAMINE THE COMOVEMENT AND LEAD-LAG RELATIONSHIPS IN THE TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAINS. WE FIND SIGNIFICANT INTERRELATEDNESS BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND INTERNATIONAL INBOUND TOURISM INDICATORS IN THE MEDIUM-AND LONG-RUN FREQUENCY DOMAINS AS THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS LIKE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT TOURIST ARRIVALS. AS A ROBUSTNESS MEASURE, WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE USING INDIAN DATA. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE MAT-TERS FOR FOREIGN TOURIST INFLOWS, THEREBY ENHANCING THE TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS OF THE HOST COUNTRY. THE POLICY IMPLICATION IS THAT COUNTRIES MUST ENHANCE THEIR GOOD GOVERNANCE TO BOOST SUSTAINABLE TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS IN ATTRACTING TOURIST INFLOWS.
116	THE EXCEPTION OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY CAN RESCIND A RULE OF LAW AGAINST A PARTICULAR CASE, WHEN THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES, IN ORDER TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY. IN THIS VEIN THE PRESENT RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE AREAS OF LAW SPECIFY AND EVENTS IN WHICH YOUHAVE APPLIED THE EXCEPTION OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SAN GIL JUDICIAL DISTRICT, CIVIL DIVISION, OCCUPATIONAL AND FAMILY, IN THE PERIOD 1991-2011, SO THAT YOU CAN CHECK WHETHER OR NOT THE JUDGES IMPLEMENT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPT. A GOOD TIME WAS OBTAINED AS A RESULT, IT ONLY MADE ??MENTION OF THIS FIGURE THREE TIMES IN THE LABOR ROOM, ONCE IN THE CIVIL HALL AND WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY ROOM, WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THAT IN ALL SITUATIONS FACTUAL WAS REQUESTED ONLY BY THE CONFLICTING PARTIES, ALLOWING US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE JUDICIAL GOES UNNOTICED THE EXCEPTION OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, A FIGURE INEFFECTIVE AGAINST OFFICIALS RESOLVED, SO THAT THE CONSTITUTION BEING "SUPREME LAW" IN A SOCIAL STATE LAW IS IRRELEVANT.
117	THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE DIRECT IMPACT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BROADENS THE SCOPE OF ASSESSMENT BY EXAMINING THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH VIA ITS IMPACT ON MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. THE STUDY USES A PANEL DATA SET OF 53 DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD OF 1996-2014. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE INDIRECT IMPACT, RATHER THAN THE DIRECT IMPACT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON GROWTH, THAT IS, THE EFFECT OF DECENTRALIZATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY MATTERS FOR GROWTH. FURTHER, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IS GROWTH ENHANCING WHEN SUPPORTED BY STABLE MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF STABILITY IN PRICES, BUDGET DEFICIT AND EXCHANGE RATE. THE EFFECT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON PER CAPITA GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH RATE IS POSITIVE WHEN IT IS COMPLEMENTED BY SOUND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW, LOW CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, HIGH-BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. ALL THESE CONCLUSIONS HOLD FOR DEVELOPED AS WELL AS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
118	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A REPRESENTATIVE AND GUARDIAN OF FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THAT SECURE THE GUARANTEES OF THE DEMOCRATIC FUNCTIONING OF THE MEMBER STATES. ONE OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OF DEMOCRACY IS THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH INCLUDES, INTER ALIA, THE COMPLIANCE OF ANY INTERFERENCE WITH THE LAW AND THE PRIMACY OF HIGHER LAWS. THE BASIC QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE CORE VALUES ARE BINDING ON THE EU LEGISLATOR ITSELF AS WELL? IN THIS CONTEXT, FURTHER QUESTIONS CAN BE RAISED SUCH AS WHETHER THE TERRITORIAL APPROACH INHERENT IN ARTICLE 174 OF THE TREATY, WHICH IS THE BASIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S OPERATION, TO WHAT EXTENT IT PREVAILS IN EU LAW? HOW THE COUNTRYSIDE, AS A TERRITORIAL UNIT DESERVING PARTICULAR ATTENTION, DOES APPEAR IN LEGISLATION AND IN EU DEVELOPMENT POLICY? DOES THE LEGISLATOR STRIVE TO ENFORCE THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS SET OUT IN THE TREATY-SUCH AS STRENGTHENING COHESION, MITIGATING TERRITORIAL DIFFERENCES? THE PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EU DRAFT LEGISLATION FOR THE POST-2020 PERIOD.
119	IS THERE ANY ROOM FOR THE APPLICATION OF VIRTUOUS DELIBERATION IN LEGAL REASONING AND ESPECIALLY IN JUDICIAL REASONING? LEGAL POSITIVISTS SUCH AS FREDERICK SCHAUER ARE INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE ETHICS OF VIRTUES (EV) ENDANGERS THE GENERALITY OF RULES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE "RULE OF LAW". I BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM FOR DIFFERENT MODELS OF APPLICATION OF THE EV TO LEGAL REASONING. LAWRENCE SOLUM OFFERS A VIRTUE-CENTRED JURISPRUDENCE THAT SHOWS HOW MANY VIRTUES CAN PLAY IMPORTANT TASKS IN JUDICIAL DELIBERATION. HE CLAIMS TO OFFER A "THICK" ACCOUNT OF THE VIRTUES BUT I CONFRONT HIS VIEWS WITH HOCK LAI'S ACCOUNT OF EPISTEMIC AND MORAL VIRTUES IN VERDICT DELIBERATION, FINDING IN THE LATTER AN EMPHASIS ON THE EMOTIONAL SIDE OF THE VIRTUES THAT IS NOT CENTRAL IN SOLUM'S THEORY. I STRESS THE POINT THAT GOOD LEGAL REASONING CANNOT HELP EMPLOYING THE VIRTUES IN DELIBERATION AND THAT THIS EMPLOYMENT, THOUGH PARTICULARISTIC TO SOME EXTENT, DOES NOT NECESSARILY CONTRAST WITH THE GENERALITY OF LAW. EPISTEMIC QUALITIES PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ADJUDICATION BUT NOT AT THE COST OF UNDERMINING THE STABILITY OF THE LAW.
120	THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE AREA OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. OF PRIMARY CONCERN IN THIS STUDY IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS POLITICAL ORGAN HAS COME TO DETERMINE AND RESTRICT JURISDICTION OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS, WITH THE EFFECT OF EXCLUDING CASES INVOLVING ALLEGED GRAVE CRIMES BY ACTORS WHOSE PRESENCE IN SITUATIONS OF WHICH THE COUNCIL IS SEIZED IS SUPPORTED BY ITS PERMANENT MEMBERS. THIS CONTROL, IT WILL BE ARGUED, UNDERMINES THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR A SOUND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, AS IT IMPEDES THESE TRIBUNALS FROM SELECTING THE CASES THAT MAY COME BEFORE THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. MORE SPECIFICALLY, RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY POLITICAL ORGANS, LEADING TO UNJUSTIFIED UNEQUAL TREATMENT BEFORE THE LAW AND THE COURTS OF PERPETRATORS AND VICTIMS OF GRAVE CRIME IN A GIVEN SITUATION, ARE CONTRARY TO PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION. A THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE SHOULD THEREFORE EXTEND TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGALITY OF SUCH RESTRICTIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGE IT AS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT OF INDEPENDENCE.
121	IN 2002, MAHER ARAR, A DUAL CANADIAN AND SYRIAN CITIZEN, WAS DETAINED AND ACCUSED BY AMERICAN AUTHORITIES OF BEING A MEMBER OF AL QA'IDA. HE WAS DEPORTED TO JORDAN AND, ULTIMATELY, SYRIA, WHERE HE WAS IMPRISONED AND SUBJECTED TO TORTURE FOR ONE YEAR. IN 2007, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER ISSUED AN APOLOGY AND 10.5 MILLION DOLLARS (CANADIAN) IN COMPENSATION. DRAWING ON CONTEMPORARY THEORETICAL ACCOUNTS OF MULTICULTURALISM, SECURITY, AND THE STATE, AND UTILIZING PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES AND AMERICAN AND CANADIAN PRINT MEDIA ACCOUNTS BETWEEN 2002 AND 2007, WE EXAMINE THE STATEMENTS OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES TO SHOW HOW THE STORY OF ARAR, FROM HIS DEPORTATION TO THE APOLOGY, HAS BEEN FRAMED IN CONTRADICTORY WAYS. THESE CONTRADICTIONS SPIN ON THREE MAIN DUALISMS: ARAR'S GUILT VERSUS INNOCENCE; ARAR'S STATUS AS A SYRIAN VERSUS CANADIAN; AND THE RULE OF LAW VERSUS EXCEPTION. IT IS ARGUED THAT THESE CONTRADICTIONS ARE OF TREMENDOUS THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEMPORARY CANADIAN STATE AS ONE IN WHICH MULTICULTURALISM AND LIBERALISM CO-EXIST WITH RACIALIZATION AND EXCEPTION.
122	BETWEEN 1989 AND 199 1, THE POLISH CONSTITUTION OF 1952 UNDERWENT A RADICAL REVISION. AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN IN ITS AMENDED FORM, IT COULD NOT SERVE AS AN ENTIRELY NEW, BASIC LAW. IN THE VIEW OF POLITICIANS AND LAWYERS, THE INTRODUCTION OF A TOTALLY REMODELLED CONSTITUTION IS INDISPENSABLE, AND MUST FIRST OF ALL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EARLIER TEXTS AND EXPERIENCES. MOREOVER, IN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION, THE ATTITUDE OF THE CONTEMPORARY LEGISLATOR TOWARDS SUCH EXPERIENCES WILL REFLECT HIS CHOICE OF THE TRADITION WITH WHICH HE WISHES TO RENEW HIS LINKS. FOREIGN MODELS, WHILE NOT BEING TAKEN AS SYSTEMATIC REFERENCE, CAN STILL BEAR OUT AND REINFORCE THIS OBSERVATION. CERTAIN OF THEIR PRINCIPLES ARE FUNDAMENTAL, AND REPRESENT THE BASIC FRAMEWOK OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING : SOCIAL JUSTICE, THE RULE OF LAW, NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, ARE UNSHAKEABLE VALUES WHICH ARE OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE MAKING OF LAWS. THE DRAFT TEXT UNQUESTIONABLY REFLECTS THIS THINKING, BUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN ITS BEING ADOPTED ARE LIKELY TO ACT AS A BRAKE ON THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL RENEWAL.
123	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A TRANS-DISCIPLINARY LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S TOTAL INVASION OF UKRAINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MALIGN LEGAL OPERATIONS (MALOPS). KNOWN COLLOQUIALLY AS LAWFARE, THE NOTION OF MALOPS IN THIS ARTICLE IS DEFINED AS 'THE EXPLOITATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS BY EMPLOYING DISINFORMATION TO SHAPE PERCEPTIONS OF LEGITIMACY, JUSTIFY VIOLATIONS, ESCAPE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, CONTAIN ADVERSARIES, OR TO ADVANTAGEOUSLY REVISE THE RULE OF LAW'. UNLIKE THE BUMPER-STICKER TERM LAWFARE, MALOPS OFFERS A THEORETICAL APPROACH TO CONCEPTUALISE, IDENTIFY, AND ULTIMATELY DISRUPT THE PRACTICE OF LEGAL EXPLOITATION, PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT RUSSIAN MALOPS PROVIDED A NEARCERTAIN INDICATION OF ATTACK IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO RUSSIA'S TOTAL INVASION OF UKRAINE. FURTHERMORE, THIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MALOPS ARE A PRINCIPAL TOOL FOR REVISIONIST STATES LIKE THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TO PURSUE LEGAL ASYMMETRIES IN PURSUIT OF GEOPOLITICAL OBJECTIVES. FINALLY, THIS RESEARCH RECOMMENDS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR RESPONDING TO THIS BEHAVIOUR IN THE FORM OF THE COUNTER-MALOPS TOOLKIT: IDENTIFY; DISRUPT; AND DEFEND.
124	IN RECENT YEARS, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE HAVE FURNISHED SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF ILLIBERALISM IN POWER. THE MOST PROMINENT AND CONSEQUENTIAL CASES ARE FIDESZ, WHICH HAS RULED IN HUNGARY SINCE 2010, AND LAW AND JUSTICE (PIS), WHICH HAS RULED IN POLAND SINCE 2015. IN BOTH CASES, ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE EMBARKED UPON AN EXTENSIVE PROJECT OF POLITICAL REFORM AIMED AT DISMANTLING THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC ORDER. WE EXAMINE THE NATURE, SCOPE, AND CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PROCESSES OF AUTOCRATISATION. WE FIRST ARGUE THAT ILLIBERAL CHANGES ARE IDEOLOGICALLY FOUNDED AND IDENTIFY HOW BOTH POPULISM AND NATIVISM FIGURE IN THE POLICYMAKING OF ILLIBERALS IN POWER. WE THEN SHOW HOW THESE PRACTICES EMERGE FROM A COMMON "ILLIBERAL PLAYBOOK"-A PARADIGM OF POLICY CHANGE COMPRISING FORMS OF FORGING, BENDING, AND BREAKING-AND ELABORATE ON THE NOTION THAT ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS ARE USING LEGALISM TO KILL LIBERALISM. THE FINE-GRAINED APPROACH THAT WE EMPLOY ALLOWS US TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT RATIONALES AND GRADATIONS OF ILLIBERAL POLICYMAKING, AND ASSESS THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, EXECUTIVE POWER, AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
125	THE COVID- 19 PANDEMIC HAS CREATED A MAJOR CRISIS IN MANY COUNTRIES. IN SUCH TIMES OF CRISIS, HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT CERTAIN LEGAL NORMS GOVERNING THE FUNCTIONING OF A SOCIETY, AS WELL AS THE IDEALS THAT GUIDE THAT SOCIETY, WILL BE BYPASSED TO MEET MORE PRESSING IMPERATIVES. THAT IS WHAT KENNETH C. WHEARE HAD THEORIZED IN HIS LANDMARK BOOK TITLED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BASED ON A HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE REASONING, THIS STUDY PROPOSES TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON GOVERNANCE IN CANADA AT THE HEIGHT OF THE "FIRST WAVE" OF THE PANDEMIC. CONCRETELY, WE TEST THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESIS : IN TIMES OF CRISIS, THE EXCEPTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH GOVERNANCE IS REORGANIZED FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME UNDERMINE THE FLAGSHIP PRINCIPLES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO GUIDE A FEDERAL POLITICAL SYSTEM. USING THE REFERENCE RE SECESSION OF QUEBEC AS THE PRISM OF ANALYSIS, WE SHOW THAT GOVERNANCE IN CANADA AT THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS HAS HAD DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS ON THE UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM, DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PROTECTION OF MINORITIES.
126	IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A TIMELY ASSESSMENT OF INDIA'S FULFILMENT OF INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE NATURE AND 'ISSUE-SALIENCE' OF DIFFERENT HUMAN RIGHTS 'PATHOLOGIES'. IT USES CRITICAL FRAME ANALYSIS OF THE CORPUS OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS' (CSOS) SUBMISSIONS TO THE THIRD CYCLE UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW (UPR). THE FINDINGS REVEAL CSOS' CONCERNS OVER THE WEAKENING OF RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON CIVIL SOCIETY DURING THE PERIOD UNDER STUDY. THIS HAS IMPACTED UPON THE ABILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THE CIVIL SOCIETY DISCOURSE ALSO HIGHLIGHTS A BROAD RANGE OF FAILINGS; INCLUDING COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, POLICE MALPRACTICE/ JUDICIAL SHORTCOMINGS, DISCRIMINATION, OPPRESSION AND INCITEMENT. IN CONTRAST, THE GOVERNMENT'S UPR SUBMISSION FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE ISSUES. IN CONCEPTUAL TERMS, THIS DISCONNECT SUGGESTS PERFORMATIVITY AND LEGITIMATION ARE A FEATURE OF THE POST-2014 NDA ADMINISTRATION'S FRAMING OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT APPEARS TO EMBRACE CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT AND THE PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN A WAY THAT ADVANCES POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, WHEREAS CIVIL SOCIETY ACCOUNTS SUGGEST OTHERWISE AND POINT TO 'LEGITIMATION' - OR A DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN RHETORIC AND REALITY.
127	PUBLIC/PRIVATE RELATIONS IN THE FIELD OF SECURITY ATTRACT CONSIDERABLE ACADEMIC ATTENTION. USUALLY, THE STATE IS CENTRAL TO THE ANALYSIS, FOCUSING ON THE DIMINISHING ROLE OF A PREVIOUSLY DOMINANT STATE. THE ROLE THAT ORGANISATIONS THEMSELVES PLAY IN THE INVESTIGATION AND SETTLEMENT OF THEIR INTERNAL NORM VIOLATIONS IS, HOWEVER, MUCH LESS RESEARCHED. AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF THE STATE DOWNPLAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH ACTIONS. THIS RESEARCH PAPER, BASED ON QUALITATIVE DATA FROM THE NETHERLANDS, HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF THE ORGANISATION AS THE PRINCIPAL ACTOR IN CORPORATE INVESTIGATIONS AND CORPORATE SETTLEMENTS. THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS UPON AND DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES OF CORPORATE INVESTIGATORS ARE CONSIDERED AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTORS AND CORPORATE SECURITY ARE REFLECTED UPON. THE PAPER ARRIVES AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LIMITED INSIGHT INTO THE MEASURES TAKEN BY ORGANISATIONS IN RESPONSE TO INTERNAL NORM VIOLATION CAN BE CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC FROM A DEMOCRATIC, RULE-OF-LAW POINT OF VIEW. THE FREEDOM OF ACTION ENJOYED BY ORGANISATIONS WITHIN THE PRIVATE LEGAL SPHERE MAKES OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL QUITE CHALLENGING.
128	THE ENACTMENT OF THE GERMAN CIVIL CODE (BGB) MARKED THE TRIUMPH OF THE ROMANISTS IN THE FAMOUS CODIFICATION DEBATE. HOWEVER, THE GERMANISTS' RESISTANCE ENDURED AND FOUND NEW GROUNDS AND MEANS OF CONFLICT. THIS ESSAY THROWS LIGHT ON THE EXPLOITATION OF THE FINE ARTS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE GERMANISTS' LEGAL POLICY. WITH THE HELP OF THE PROMINENT MURALS IN THE PLENARY HALL OF THE COURT OF APPEAL IN DSSELDO, EXECUTED IN 1913, WE WILL EXAMINE THE CONTINUING INFLUENCE OF THE GERMANISTIC COMBAT AND THE SOCIOPOLITICAL MORES OF THE FUNCTIONARY ELITE OF THE LATE EMPIRE. IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE MURALS WERE AN EXPRESSION OF THE RESSENTIMENT OF A CERTAIN PART OF THESE 'POWER ELITES' TOWARDS THE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL STATE WHICH HAD COME INTO EXISTENCE BY THE TIME OF THE CODIFICATION OF THE BGB AT THE VERY LATEST. NAZI IDEOLOGY WAS ABLE TO APPEAL TO THESE POLITICAL DISPOSITIONS AND VALUES AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR. THIS WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR ROUTES THAT LED TO THE NAZI TAKEOVER AND FINALLY TO THE DECLINE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GERMANY.
129	THE AIM OF THIS ESSAY IS TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF ALGERIA FROM A LEGAL AND POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW. ON APRIL 2011, PRESIDENT OF ALGERIA TOOK THE INITIATIVE TO REFORM AND TRY TO MEET THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEMANDS OF INCREASINGLY PRESSING OF THE POPULATION. THE WHOLE QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE FUTURE REFORMS ARE THE STAKES: DO THEY AIM TO ESTABLISH PEOPLE'S SOVEREIGNTY, EVEN QUESTIONING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SYSTEM, OR IS IT THEN, RATHER, SAVE AND ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF THIS SYSTEM? FORMALLY, THE MONARCH WANTS TO REFORM THE GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY. BUT APPARENTLY, THIS WOULD MEAN JUST SOME "CONTROLLED" CHANGES THAT WOULD NOT LEAD TO A RUPTURE. AS PROOF, THE MONARCH WISHED TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF AS PART OF REFORMS AND CONTOURS; HE LAYS DOWN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND OBJECTIVES. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE ALGERIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM CAN NOT, ON PAIN OF RENDERING ITS OWN LOSS, SUBMIT TO THE DEMANDS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW RECOGNIZED TODAY NOT ONLY AS HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT ALSO THE ONLY CRITERIA CIVILITY AND INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITY.
130	THE GOVERNANCE ADVICE THAT IS OFFERED TO AFRICA USUALLY IDENTIFIES A LIST OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' GOALS LIKE STABLE PROPERTY RIGHTS, A RULE OF LAW, LOW CORRUPTION AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AS PRECONDITIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT. THESE GOALS ARE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPENSIVE PUBLIC GOODS BUT IN ADDITION THEIR ENFORCEMENT IS TYPICALLY AT VARIANCE WITH POWERFUL INTERESTS IN THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE AND MUCH INSTITUTIONAL THEORY SUGGESTS THAT DURING THEIR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAD A DIFFERENT SET OF 'DEVELOPMENTAL' OR 'GROWTH-ENHANCING' GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES THAT ENABLED THEIR STATES TO SUPPORT CRITICAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TRANSFORMATIONS AND ASSIST FIRMS IN ACQUIRING AND LEARNING TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES THEY USED DIFFERED BECAUSE THEIR POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL STARTING POINTS WERE DIFFERENT. THERE ARE THEREFORE NO BLUEPRINTS FOR AFRICA OR ANYWHERE ELSE, BUT CERTAINLY THE GOOD GOVERNANCE MENU IS UNREALISTIC. RATHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE TO EXPERIMENT AND DEVELOP INSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT WORK IN THEIR CONTEXT AND WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TRANSFORMING PROPERTY RIGHTS AND ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION.
131	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF ELECTIONS AND PARTICULARLY THEIR ADMINISTRATION ON NIGERIA'S DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS. IT ARGUES THAT ELECTIONS UNDER THE FOURTH REPUBLIC (1999-2007) WERE CHARACTERIZED BY INEFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION AT ALL STAGES AND LEVELS (BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER), RESULTING IN DAMAGINGLY DISCREDITED OUTCOMES. THIS WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE WEAK INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE PRIMARY AGENCIES OF ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATION, PARTICULARLY THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC) AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES. INEC LACKS BOTH INSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AUTONOMY, AS MANIFESTED BY ITS COMPOSITION AND FUNDING BY THE PRESIDENCY, AS WELL AS ITS GROSS LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM AND SECURITY OF TENURE FOR ITS OFFICIALS. ELECTIONS CAN ONLY ENGENDER THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN NIGERIA IF THE ELECTORAL PROCESSES ARE REFORMED IN WAYS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THE AUTONOMY AND CAPABILITY OF INEC AND RELATED ELECTORAL AGENCIES, PARTICULARLY POLITICAL PARTIES, TO DISCHARGE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES EFFECTIVELY. THE RECENT TREND TOWARDS CHALLENGING ELECTORAL FRAUD IN THE COURTS, HOWEVER, DOES SIGNAL A STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND GIVES SOME REASON FOR OPTIMISM.
132	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SUPERVISORY REVIEW (NADZOR) AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEGAL NORMS AS RES JUDICATA AND THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. NADZOR GENERALLY SERVES AS EXTRAORDINARY APPEAL OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUDGMENTS THAT ALREADY HAVE ENTERED INTO LEGAL FORCE. THE AUTHOR FIRST EXAMINES THE HISTORICAL ROOTS OF SUPERVISORY REVIEW DURING THE SOVIET PERIOD. HE THEN ANALYZES HOW THE SUPERVISORY REVIEW PROCESS HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE 2002 CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE AND THE 2001 CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE. THE AUTHOR ALSO REVIEWS THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN INFLUENCING THE CHANGES TO THE SUPERVISORY REVIEW PROCESS. ALTHOUGH THIS PROCESS HAS BECOME FAIRER AND MORE TRANSPARENT, THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT NADZOR REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL, MOST NOTABLY DUE TO THE LACK OF FINALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING THE PROSPECTS FOR NADZOR AND HOW THIS PROCESS HAS INFLUENCED RUSSIA'S TRANSITION TO A RULE OF LAW STATE.
133	IN THIS REVIEW ESSAY, I FIRST SET OUT AND THEN SUBJECT TO CRITICISM THE MAIN CLAIMS ADVANCED BY WILLIAM TALBOTT IN HIS EXCELLENT RECENT BOOK, "WHICH RIGHTS SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL?". TALBOTT OFFERS A CONCEPTION OF BASIC UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS AS THE MINIMALLY NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS TO POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. I ARGUE THAT HIS CONCEPTION IS AT ONCE TOO ROBUSTLY LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC AND TOO INATTENTIVE TO KEY FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW TO PLAY THIS ROLE. I SUGGEST THAT JOHN RAWLS'S CONCEPTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMES CLOSER TO HITTING THE MARK TALBOTT SETS FOR HIMSELF AND THAT TALBOTT INCORRECTLY REJECTS RAWLS'S VIEW. I CONCLUDE THAT WHAT LIKELY DIVIDES TALBOTT AND RAWLS IS THAT RAWLS, BUT NOT TALBOTT, EXPLICITLY FRAMES THE INQUIRY INTO THE MINIMALLY NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS TO POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IN TERMS OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE, AS A MATTER OF ITS JUST FOREIGN POLICY, WHETHER OR NOT TO RECOGNIZE OTHER ORGANIZED POLITIES AS INDEPENDENT AND SELFDETERMINING WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER.
134	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE REASONS WHY CORRUPTION AND POLICY DISTORTIONS TEND TO EXHIBIT A HIGH DEGREE OF PERSISTENCE IN CERTAIN REGIMES. WE IDENTIFY CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A FIRM SEEKS TO EVADE REGULATIONS THROUGH (I) BRIBERY OF LOCAL INSPECTORS, AND (II) BY LOBBYING HIGH-LEVEL GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS TO RESIST LEGAL REFORMS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY (RULE OF LAW) AND ELIMINATE CORRUPTION. WE SHOW THAT IN SOME CASES POLITICAL INSTABILITY REINFORCES THESE TENDENCIES. THE ANALYSIS PREDICTS THAT IN POLITICALLY UNSTABLE REGIMES, THE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARY TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE COMPLIANCE ARE WEAK. IN SUCH COUNTRIES, CORRUPTION THEREFORE IS MORE PERVASIVE, AND THE COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS IS LOW. WE TEST THESE PREDICTIONS USING CROSS-COUNTRY DATA. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SUPPORT THE PREDICTIONS OF THE MODEL. POLITICAL INSTABILITY REDUCES JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY, WHICH IN TURN STIMULATES CORRUPTION. THUS, THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY ON CORRUPTION IS NOT DIRECT, BUT OCCURS INDIRECTLY VIA ITS EFFECT ON THE DEGREE OF JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY. FINALLY, CORRUPTION LOWERS THE LEVEL OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. THUS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY INDIRECTLY AFFECTS COMPLIANCE, VIA JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY AND CORRUPTION.
135	MANY HAVE REGARDED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN AND DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF A NASCENT DEMOCRACY. EXPERIENCE FROM THIRD-WAVE DEMOCRACIES SUCH AS CHILE AND THE PHILIPPINES SHOWS US THAT, IN ORDER FOR DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION TO BE ACHIEVED, DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE ARMED FORCES MUST BE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. OFTEN THESE NASCENT DEMOCRACIES FACE THE PROBLEM OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE LEGACY OF THE MILITARY AND SECURITY SERVICE'S ROLE IN AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVILIAN CONTROL IN SOUTH KOREA AND ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH SEMICIVILIAN CONTROL WAS ESTABLISHED DURING THE ONLY POST-TRANSITION PRESIDENCY, IT WAS WITH THE INAUGURATION OF KIM YOUNG-SAM IN 1993 THAT FIRM CIVILIAN CONTROL WAS ACHIEVED. HOWEVER, THE WAY THIS CONTROL WAS ACHIEVED RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH KOREA. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT DUE TO THE CONTINUING DOMINANCE OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENSE POLICY BY THE EXECUTIVE, THE COMPREHENSIVE OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED FOR TRUE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL HAS YET TO BE FULLY ACHIEVED.
136	ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENTS OF POLAND AND HUNGARY SEEM TO SIMILARLY CONTEST THE CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM THAT REQUIRES ONE TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW WHEN USING EU FUNDS, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES. THEY BECOME VISIBLE IN THE FRAMING OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION AS REGARDS THE OPPOSITION PARTIES. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE GROUNDS OF THE COMPETITION FROM PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN RELATION TO THE EU RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE FUND. AN ANALYSIS OF 2021'S PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES ON NATIONAL RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE PLANS REVEALED THREE COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORKS: THE FINANCIAL FRAME (THE POLICY DIMENSION), THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE FRAME (THE POLITICS DIMENSION), AND THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION FRAME WHICH SHAPED DOMESTIC POLITICAL RIVALRY (THE POLITY DIMENSION). DIFFERENCES WITHIN THESE FRAMINGS BETWEEN THE NARRATIVE OF THE POLISH AND HUNGARIAN OPPOSITION RESULTED FROM DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL CONTEXTS. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL OPPOSITION PARTIES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. THE EXISTENCE OF A LIBERAL OPPOSITION MAY PROMOTE THE SALIENCE OF THE TOPIC OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL DEBATE.
137	THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NATURAL CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT USING PANEL DATA COMPRISING A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD FOR THE PERIOD 1995-2018. THE STUDY ACCOUNTS FOR SEVERAL KEY DRIVERS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE PRODUCED CAPITAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, TRADE AND INSTITU-TIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS. OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EFFECT FLOWING FROM NATURAL CAPITAL TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IS SIZABLE AND POSITIVE. THE INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS SUCH AS THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DRIVING ECONOMIC GROWTH POSITIVELY. OVERALL, WE REJECT THE RESOURCE CURSE HYPOTHESIS AND SUPPORT THE RESOURCE BLESSING HYPOTHESIS. THE EVIDENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT THE COMBINED EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS AND RESOURCES IS NOT A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING GROWTH. THESE RESULTS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT FOR BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES. THE STUDY OFFERS IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND ADDS A NEW DIMENSION TO THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON THE NEXUS BETWEEN RESOURCE ABUNDANCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH BY USING WEALTH AND CAPITAL DATA.
138	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A ROUNDUP OF THE UK CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT'S LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME IN 2021, ARGUING THAT, IN THE SERVICE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN AGENDA, IT USES LAW TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TO CRIMINALISE MARGINALISED AND/OR RACIALISED GROUPS, INCLUDING ASYLUM SEEKERS AND THOSE HELPING THEM, BLACK YOUTH, PROTESTERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS, AND GYPSIES, ROMA AND TRAVELLERS. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS NEW BILLS THAT ATTACK HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE POLICE, CRIME, SENTENCING AND COURTS BILL, THE NATIONALITY AND BORDERS BILL, THE OVERSEAS OPERATIONS ACT, THE ELECTIONS BILL AND THE JUDICIAL REVIEW AND COURTS BILL, SHE DEMONSTRATES THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME THAT HAS ENTRENCHED THE DEMONISATION OF MINORITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS, WHILST GIVING UNPRECEDENTED POWERS TO POLICE, HOBBLING THE COURTS, NOBBLING OTHER REGULATORS AND BLOCKING EFFECTIVE LEGAL, POLITICAL AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MINISTERS. THE RESULT, SHE ARGUES, IS AN EROSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENTRENCHMENT OF IMPUNITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES.
139	THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON DISTRICT-LEVEL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT BY USING THE SPATIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE APPROACH. THE SPATIAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL ALSO DECOMPOSES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON DISTRICT-LEVEL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. REGARDING MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY, OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, TERTIARY EDUCATION, ROAD LENGTH, AND DISTRICT LEVEL DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS HAVE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON DISTRICT-LEVEL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY. SIMILARLY, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ROAD LENGTH, HEALTH INSTITUTIONS, SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE, URBANIZATION, AND POPULATION DENSITY ARE SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL FACTORS TO SHOW BOTH THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON DISTRICT LEVELS. THESE FINDINGS ALSO IMPLY THAT THE SPILLOVER EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE WELLBEING OF NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS AS WELL. ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION APPEAR TO DECREASE DISTRICT-LEVEL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY AND INCREASE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. A POLICY IMPLICATION OF THE STUDY MAY PROVE AN INNOVATIVE DELIVERY STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE THE TARGET OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL-1 (SDG-1) FOR PAKISTAN.
140	WHILE IT IS ONLY ONE OF THE FEATURES OF GOOD LOCAL GOVERNANCE, THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROMOTES CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, ENHANCES ACCOUNTABILITY, ENFORCES THE RULE OF LAW, SOCIAL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION AND CONTROL CORRUPTION. THEREFORE, INSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO ENHANCE THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT VIETNAM HAS ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO IN RECENT YEARS. BASED ON A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND DATA FROM THE PROVINCIAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE INDEX (PAPI), THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN VIETNAM FROM 2011 TO PRESENT. RESEARCH RESULTS SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN VIETNAM HAS IMPROVED, IT STILL DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE CONSTRUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN HIGHLY VALUED, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS AREA IS STILL NOT HIGH. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY IS TIED TO CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT NOT TO OTHER ASPECTS, SUCH AS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND CONTROL CORRUPTION.
141	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES JUDICIAL DUTY OF IMPROVING THE LAW ON EPISTEMIC GROUNDS AND CLAIMS IN THAT REGARDING THIS OBLIGATION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GIVE A PLACE TO FREE SPEECH FROM AN EPISTEMIC POINT OF VIEW. AS A REQUIREMENT OF HAVING EPISTEMIC AGENCY, JUDGES LIKE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS HAVE EPISTEMOLOGICAL RESPONSIBILITY. DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS' RESPONSIBILITY, JUDGES' RESPONSIBILITY IS CONNECTED TO THEIR DUTY OF IMPROVING THE LAW, WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THEIR JOB AS WELL AS THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL PROFESSIONAL PRINCIPLES. JUDGES SHOULD IMPROVE THE LAW'S CAPACITY TO GUIDE THE CONDUCT OF ITS CITIZENS, WHO ARE OBLIGATED TO OBEY THE LAW. IMPROVING THE LAW ALSO IMPROVES THE DELIVERY OF JUSTICE. THE WAYS OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND JUSTIFICATION ARE IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE IT. WHILE APPLYING THE LAW, JUDGES CAN FIND THE LAW UNCLEAR OR THEY MAY ENCOUNTER SOME NORM CONFLICTS. IN THESE CASES, THEY SHOULD RESOLVE THEM TO KEEP THE LAW 'LEGALLY IN GOOD SHAPE', WHICH SHOULD MEET EPISTEMOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS. WHEN FULFILLING THIS OBLIGATION, JUDICIAL FREE SPEECH ON EPISTEMIC GROUNDS SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED.
142	ALTERNATION IN POWER IS INDISPENSABLE AND ESSENTIAL IN A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN A RADICAL CHANGE IN POLICY OCCURS? THIS IS THE SITUATION IN BRAZIL, WHICH HAS BEEN RULED BY THE LEFT OVER THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS, AND BY A CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNMENT IN THE PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS, WHICH HAS BEEN RULED BY THE FAR RIGHT FROM 2019 ONWARDS. THE SPEECH, BESIDES DEMAGOGIC AND POPULISM DEMONSTRATIONS, HAS REVEALED POSSIBILITIES OF SETBACKS IN SEVERAL AREAS, CAUSING PARTICULAR STRESS TO THE AREA OF EDUCATION. THE IDEAS "SCHOOL WITHOUT PARTY" AND "SCHOOL WITHOUT SEX EDUCATION" ARE TWO POINTS OF THIS PROGRAM THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC. WHAT IS BEHIND THESE PROGRAMMATIC POINTS? THE MATTER OF THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY SETBACK IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY THE LEGISLATION. THEREFORE, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FUNCTION OF LAW, THE EVOLUTION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION, TAKING AS ITS STARTING POINT AND THEORETICAL REFERENCE NIKLAS LUHMANN'S THEORY OF AUTOPOIETIC SOCIAL SYSTEMS IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
143	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION BY KEEPING IN VIEW THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (IQ) IN THE SOUTH ASIAN REGION. SECOND-GENERATIONAL UNIT ROOT TEST IS USED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCY. MIXED ORDER OF INTEGRATION ENABLED US TO USE PANEL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (ARDL) METHOD TO INVESTIGATE SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN ASSOCIATION. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY ALSO EMPLOYS GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST TO EXPLORE CAUSALITIES AMONG THE SELECTED VARIABLES. EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT FDI HAS A POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS MEASURED AS RULE OF LAW HAS INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT BOTH IN SHORT RUN AS WELL AS LONG RUN. HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT STABILITY DECREASES ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION WHILE CORRUPTION ENHANCES ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS TREMENDOUSLY. THIS STUDY ALSO SUPPORTS ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) FOR THE SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY EMPHASIZED THE ROLE OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES MUST FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
144	IT IS A MISJUDGEMENT TO ASSUME THAT R&D SUBSIDIES, PATENT PROTECTIONS OR ALIKE ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE INNOVATION. IN FACT, INNOVATIONS INCUBATE AND HATCH WITHIN AN ENVIRONMENT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A FRIENDLY ONE. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO LOOK FOR THE MAJOR FACTORS WHICH ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OR PILLARS OF SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. AFTER DISCUSSING AND ANALYSING THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES ON THE MAJOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS WHICH ARE THE LIKELY CONSTITUENTS OF OUR INQUIRED ENVIRONMENT, FOUR MAJOR BLOCKS OR PILLARS APPEAR TO BE THE BASIC COMPONENTS ON THEORETICAL GROUNDS. THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS THE FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF INCLUSIVENESS, NAMELY LEGAL/REGULATORY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND INFORMATORY. A MODEL IS DEVELOPED BY EMPLOYING VARIABLES REPRESENTING THESE FOUR GROUPS TO MEASURE AND TO ANALYSE THEIR IMPACT ON INNOVATION. THE MODEL IS TESTED BY UTILISING THE PANEL DATA OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR INNOVATION REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF RULE OF LAW, GENDER EQUALITY, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STABILITY, AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION.
145	ANALYSTS OF "STATE CAPTURE" TOO OFTEN TREAT THE PHENOMENON AS AN OUTSIDE-IN PROCESS. THEY IDENTIFY FIRMS OR RENT-SEEKING POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURS THAT TAKE OVER, SUBVERT, OR OTHERWISE BEND POLITICAL STRUCTURES TO SERVE THEIR PAROCHIAL INTERESTS. THE KEY TO SOLVING THE PERCEIVED PROBLEM IS SUPPOSED TO LIE IN BETTER GOVERNANCE, STRENGTHENED JUDICIAL SYSTEMS, CIVIC EDUCATION, AND TRANSPARENCY IN POLITICAL AND CIVIC ACTIVITIES. THIS ESSAY WILL SUGGEST THIS CONSTRUCT INVOLVES A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATRONAGE NETWORKS AND SUPPOSEDLY "LEGITIMATE" LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS ENSHRINED IN A TELEOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE-OF-LAW PERFORMANCES. PATRONAGE POLITICS IN THE BALKANS PRODUCES PRAGMATIC SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PATTERNS, NOT JUST THEFT BY GREEDY FIRMS AND SELFISH INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARGUMENT BUILDS ON CHARLES TILLY'S OBSERVATION OF THE INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TRUST TO EXPLAIN WHY EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PROGRAMS OF CIVIC EDUCATION AND POLITICAL REFORM DESIGNED TO FREE A STATE FROM ITS PERCEIVED CAPTURE FAIL TO DO MUCH MORE THAN RECRUIT A THIN SLIVER OF LOCAL CIVIC ACTIVISTS, SCOLD "CAPTURED" POPULATIONS, AND UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL OVERSEERS.
146	DRAWING ON IRAQI PRINT MEDIA PUBLISHED DURING THE LATE 1980S AND 1990S, THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE HISTORIOGRAPHY OF BATHIST IRAQ BY OFFERING A FRESH READING INTO OPEN SOURCES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN USED BY SCHOLARS. IT FOCUSES ON ISSUES LIKE DEMOCRATIZATION, FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW AND HOW THEY WERE ARTICULATED IN IRAQI PRINT MEDIA. THIS DISCOURSE FUNCTIONED AS A STRATEGIC TOOL OF COMMUNICATION TO REPRODUCE AND STABILIZE THE EXISTING ORDER. BY MOVING BEYOND MECHANISMS OF BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL, REPRESSION OR COOPTATION, THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS A NEGLECTED ELEMENT OF THE FORMER REGIME'S TECHNIQUES OF GOVERNANCE. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE IRAQI BA'THIST REGIME AIMED TO DEMOBILIZE A TARGET AUDIENCE IT SUSPECTED OF HARBOURING OPPOSITIONAL FEELINGS AND PRO-DEMOCRACY IDEAS THAT WENT BEYOND WHAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS WILLING TO CONSIDER. IT DID SO BY INSTALLING, SIMULATING OR TOLERATING SPACES OF CONTESTATION THAT HELPED TO EASE THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE' IRAQIS SENSED BETWEEN AN OFFICIAL DISCOURSE OF A PEOPLE UNITED IN LOVE FOR ITS LEADER, AND THE DAILY EXPERIENCE OF BRUTAL REPRESSION AND DETERIORATING LIVING CONDITIONS.
147	WE EXPLORE HOW CHINESE FIRMS VARY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY USE ILLEGAL OVERTIME (WORKING HOURS BEYOND THE STATUTORY LIMIT) IN THE FACE OF EMERGING INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURE AGAINST SUCH PRACTICES. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, LOCAL AS WELL AS FOREIGN-OWNED FIRMS IN CHINA HAVE EXTENSIVELY EXPLOITED THE PRACTICE OF ILLEGAL OVERTIME. THIS IS NOW BEING CHALLENGED BY A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THAT EMPHASIZES THE RULE OF LAW. YET, NOT ALL CHINESE COMPANIES ARE EQUALLY RESPONSIVE TO THIS EMERGING REALITY. WHILE SOME COMPANIES ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT VIOLATING OVERTIME REGULATIONS, OTHERS STILL IGNORE THE LAW, RELYING HEAVILY ON ILLEGAL OVERTIME. WE EXPLAIN SUCH VARIANCES BY DRAWING ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL THEORY LITERATURE THAT HIGHLIGHT THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AS A MECHANISM TO ELICIT VARIED, RATHER THAN UNIFIED, ORGANIZATIONAL REACTIONS. USING DATA FROM 182 ELECTRONIC PARTS FIRMS IN CHINA, WE FOUND THAT FIRMS' USE OF ILLEGAL OVERTIME IS AFFECTED BOTH BY ORGANIZATIONS' INNER CONSTITUENTS WHO GENERATE INTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES (HR PERSONNEL, LABOR UNIONS AND MIGRANT WORKERS), AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAGNIFY EXTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL PRESSURES (GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, COMPANY SIZE AND FOREIGN OWNERSHIP).
148	THIS ARTICLE SITUATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE IN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF THE COUNTRY'S TRANSITIONAL PERIOD BETWEEN 1999 AND 2004. DURING THIS PIVOTAL PERIOD, SIERRA LEONE EXPERIENCED A MASSIVE STATE-BUILDING INTERVENTION TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW AND INTRODUCE DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, THIS NEW BEGINNING WAS CHARACTERIZED BY VIOLENT CLASHES BETWEEN THE LEADERS OF THE VARIOUS WARRING FACTIONS WHO TRIED TO SECURE POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND SECURITY AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE LOME PEACE AGREEMENT IN 1999. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES EVENTS THAT RESULTED IN THE UNRAVELLING OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL COURT AND THE ARRESTS OF HUNDREDS OF SUSPECTED REBELS UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY, TO SHOW HOW THEY UNDERMINED THE LOFTY PROMISES OF JUSTICE MADE BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SPECIAL COURT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IT REVEALS THE LIMITED SCOPE OF THE RETRIBUTIVE PROJECT OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT THE INTERSECTIONS WITH THE BUSINESS-AS-USUAL POLITICAL MANOEUVRES THAT OCCURRED AFTER THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR.
149	ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS OFTEN EQUATED WITH ACCESS TO INSTITUTIONALIZED DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, AND THE OBJECTIVE BARRIERS THAT HINDER SUCH ACCESS-COSTS AND DELAY MOST PARTICULARLY-ARE COMMONLY IDENTIFIED AS THE PRIMARY OBJECTS OF REFORM EFFORTS. IN SHARP CONTRAST, WHEN INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH RACIALIZED YOUTHS IN TORONTO REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCES OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINARY MATTERS, ACCOUNTS OF ACCESS TO DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES BEING IMPEDED BY COSTS AND DELAY DID NOT FIGURE PROMINENTLY. THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS REVEALED THAT MANY RACIALIZED YOUTHS SCARCELY EVER CONSIDERED ACCESSING INSTITUTIONALIZED DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES LARGELY BECAUSE THEY LACKED INFORMATION THAT WOULD ENABLE THEM TO "NAME" A POTENTIAL LEGAL PROBLEM, BELIEVED THAT "BLAMING" A POWERFUL STATE ACTOR WAS FUTILE OR WOULD PROVOKE RETALIATION, AND HAD A DEEP SKEPTICISM REGARDING THE ABILITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO DISPENSE JUSTICE WHEN "CLAIMS" ARE MADE. FOR THE YOUTHS, UNDERSTANDING (AS OPPOSED TO STEREOTYPING), MUTUAL RESPECT, SECOND CHANCES, AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE THE KEY FEATURES OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
150	SINCE THE START OF ITS POST-SOCIALIST TRANSFORMATION IN 1989, BULGARIA HAS IMPORTED A LARGE NUMBER OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS FROM ADVANCED MARKET ECONOMICS, INCLUDING THE EU-15. HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION OF EU AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL RULES HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE DUE TO WEAK ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICATION BY DOMESTIC ACTORS SUCH AS THE SECURITIES REGULATOR, COURTS, AND COMPANY OWNERS/MANAGERS. THE FAILURES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN BULGARIA UNTIL THE EARLY 2000S CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BROAD INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT (THE LACK OF RULE OF LAW) AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF QUASI-PUBLIC COMPANIES AS A RESULT OF THE FIRST WAVE OF MASS PRIVATISATION (1996-97). SINCE 2002, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE AND PROTECTION OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PROPOSITION THAT THIS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE PROSPECT OF EU ACCESSION, WHICH HAS CERTAINLY INFLUENCED THE ATTITUDES AND EXPECTATIONS OF DOMESTIC ACTORS. BASED ON COMPANY SURVEYS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, THE PAPER ANALYSES HOW THE SECURITIES REGULATOR AND COMPANY OWNERS/MANAGERS HAVE BEEN ADAPTING TO THE IMPORTED FORMAL RULES.
151	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE TAIWAN REFERENDUM LAW 2003 AND THE DEFENCE REFERENDUM HELD IN 2004 RAISE A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT DESERVE CLOSER EXAMINATION. IT DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF THE REFERENDUM LAW FROM BOTH LEGAL AND POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS AND ARGUES THAT A FUNCTIONAL AND LEGITIMATE REFERENDUM MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES FOUR MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN 2005. FIRST, THE REFERENDUM LAW CONTAINED UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT WERE NOT CHALLENGED BEFORE THE DEFENCE REFERENDUM WAS HELD. SECONDLY, THE REFERENDUM LAW SHOULD HAVE EXPRESSLY RELIED ON THE CONSTITUTION AS ITS LEGAL BASIS. THIRDLY, THE REFERENDUM LAW DOES NOT CLEARLY DETERMINE THE LEGAL EFFECTS OF THE REFERENDUM. FOURTHLY, IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ADEQUATE LEGAL RESTRAINTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO CALL A DEFENCE REFERENDUM. THESE LEGAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN POLITICALLY ORIENTED CASES IN THE COURTS. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, CONCLUDES THAT THE INITIATIVE TO RECTIFY THE LEGAL PROBLEMS OF THE REFERENDUM LAW SHOULD LIE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN OF TAIWAN.
152	JOHANNES CHAN'S EXTENSIVE BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP AND COMMENTARY HAS BROUGHT HONG KONG'S CONSTITUTIONAL JOURNEY, AND CONVEYED ITS SIGNIFICANCE, TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. SEVERAL KEY THEMES EMERGE FROM CHAN'S WORK. HE EVALUATES HONG KONG JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND ACTIONS BY THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR CONFORMITY TO BOTH APPLICABLE POSITIVE LAW AND TRANSCENDENT PRIN-CIPLES, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, LIBERAL CONCEPTIONS OF RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND COMMON LAW NORMS - ALL THE WHILE RECOGNISING THAT NEITHER MEASURE ALONE OFFERS AN ADEQUATE ANALYSIS AND CRITIQUE. HIS WRITINGS RECOGNISE AND EXPLORE THE ESPECIALLY PERVASIVE INTERTWINING OF LAW AND POLITICS IN HONG KONG. HE OFFERS WISE ADVICE TO KEY INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPANTS, GROUNDED IN CAREFUL ASSESSMENTS OF THEIR ACTIONS AND OPTIONS, AND APPEALING PRAGMATICALLY TO THEIR SELF-INTEREST. HIS APPRAISALS HAVE BECOME MORE PESSIMISTIC, REFLECTING DEVELOPMENTS IN HONG KONG, BUT HE HAS REMAINED RESILIENTLY COMMITTED TO THE VIRTUES AND VALUES THAT HAVE CONSISTENTLY MOTIVATED, AND RESONATED IN, HIS WRITINGS. CHAN'S EXTRAORDI-NARY CONTRIBUTIONS EXTEND BEYOND HIS WRITINGS TO HIS ROLES AS PRACTISING LAWYER, LAW DEAN, AND PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL.
153	THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN COLOMBIA AND ITS ISSUE TO BE ENFORCEABLE FOR ANY PERSON, IT MAY BE KNOWN FROM A CONTEXT OF CRISIS OR COMPLEXITY, ALL ABOUT THE VARIOUS TYPOLOGIES OF SOURCES THAT MAINLY WORK ACCORDING TO CASE LAW, WHERE THEY ARE CONSTANTLY IN TENSION, IN ADDITION TO THEIR CONCRETION OF THAT INTERACTION, AMONG OTHERS, THE RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION AND THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY OF LAW, ALL OF THEM ARE THE BASIS FOR ANY WELL-ORGANIZED SOCIETY THAT CAN BE DECLARED CONSTITUTIONALLY AS A RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO THE CHARACTERIZATION AND SYSTEMATIZATION OF LAW FROM CASE LAW THAT IS CREATED FROM SUB-RULES THAT DEFINE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL CONTENTS FOR ANY ISSUE ACCORDING TO THE CASE STUDY, ALL OF THOSE SITUATIONS HAVE SHOWN THE CURRENT CRISIS STATUS AND THE COMPLEXITY IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THEIR EFFECT TO PRODUCE THE FINAL AIM OF THIS RESEARCH COMPOSED BY THREE PARTS (PART I, PART II AND PART III), ALL ACCORDING TO THE TERM THAT WE HAVE NAMED GENERAL CLAUSE OF THE SOURCES OF LAW IN COLOMBIA.
154	HISTORIANS OF RACE RELATIONS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE HAVE EMPHASIZED THE WAYS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW EMERGED AS A MECHANISM OF RACIAL CONTROL IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY SOUTH, GRADUALLY SUPPLANTING ROUGH JUSTICE. THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE PROTRACTED, UNEVEN PACE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF JIM CROW CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN NEW ORLEANS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE ADJUDICATION OF HOMICIDE CASES IN NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN 1920 AND 1945 REVEALS THAT THE MAJORITY OF BLACK-ON-WHITE HOMICIDES DID NOT RESULT IN CONVICTIONS, AND ONLY A SMALL MINORITY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS SUSPECTED-OR EVEN CONVICTED-OF INTERRACIAL MURDER WENT TO THE GALLOWS. BUT RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CONVICTIONS AND EXECUTIONS WIDENED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE INTERWAR ERA. THUS, THIS ESSAY ANALYZES THE SOCIAL, CULTURAL, AND LEGAL SHIFTS THAT EXPANDED RACE-BASED DIFFERENTIALS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT, IRONICALLY, JIM CROW PRESCRIPTIONS INTENSIFIED WHITE FEARS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CRIME AND HELPED TO GENERATE THE ANXIETIES THAT LEGAL MEASURES WERE IMPOSED TO ADDRESS, INCREASING RACIAL DISPARITIES AND MAKING RACIAL BIASES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SELF-PERPETUATING.
155	WHILE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS OFTEN CONSIDERED TO BE A FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT JUDGES AND COURT DECISION-MAKING ARE SENSITIVE TO THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE ONE CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH POLITICAL ALIGNMENT OF THE JUDGES CAN MANIFEST ITSELF AND VERIFY WHETHER POLITICAL PARTY SUPPORT, EXPRESSED AS A RECOMMENDATION TO THE TRIBUNAL, IS RELEVANT FOR THE ALLOCATION OF JUDGES TO ADJUDICATION PANELS. OUR SPECIFIC EXAMPLE COMES FROM THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AND REFERS TO THE PERIOD 2005-2014. WITH RESPECT TO THE MASS OF FILED CASES, WE DO NOT FIND THAT ALLOCATION OF JUDGES TO ADJUDICATION PANELS FAVORED NOMINEES OF ANY POLITICAL PARTY. OUR RESULTS HOWEVER PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE STRATEGIC SELECTION TO ADJUDICATION PANELS IN POLITICALLY SENSITIVE CASES IN THE PERIOD 2011-2014. WE FIND THAT NOMINEES OF THE GOVERNING PARTY WERE ALLOCATED TO THESE PANELS MORE OFTEN THAN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TRIBUNAL AND THAT IN THESE CASES THEY HAD MORE VOTING POWER THAN IN CASES OF LOWER POLITICAL CLOUT.

156	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A CRITICAL STUDY OF THE NORMATIVE AND JURISPRUDENTIAL DEFORMATIONS TO THE MODEL OF A UNITARY, DECENTRALIZED STATE WITH AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL TERRITORIES, AS WELL AS OF THE WEAKENING OF CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AS A STRUCTURAL PILLAR OF THE STATE FORM ADOPTED IN THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF 1991. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF POPULAR CONSULTATIONS ON MINING ENERGY PROJECTS. IT ALLOWS CONCLUDING THAT, ALTHOUGH THE POPULAR CONSULTATIONS REOPENED IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TERRITORY, THE RELEVANT MODIFICATIONS HAVE SHOWN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE COLOMBIAN TERRITORIAL MODEL THAT ARISE FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN. AMID TENSIONS AND INCONCLUSIVE DEBATES IN THE NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NATION AND TERRITORIAL ENTITIES, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS ARE SHAPING THE FORMATION OF AN ACTIVE AND QUALIFIED CITIZENRY THAT PERSISTS IN DEMANDING PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS RELATING TO THEIR TERRITORY. THIS PARTICIPATION IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE SOCIAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS THE INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BEING IN THEIR OWN SOCIAL CONTEXT.
157	POLITICAL HOSTILITY, UNREST AND FLAWED GOVERNANCE CAUSE INSECURITY LEADING TO DEMORALIZATION, WHICH TRIGGERS MIGRATION. THERE IS A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE ON THE DETERMINANTS OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS A RANGE OF FACTORS TO EXPLAIN THE DIRECTION AND STRENGTH OF MIGRANT FLOWS. FOR THIS RESEARCH WE INTERVIEWED 32 RESPONDENTS WHO WERE A CONTROL GROUP IN A STUDY CONDUCTED A DECADE AGO. THESE RESPONDENTS WERE DETERMINED NOT TO MIGRATE, BUT THEIR MIGRATION DECISION WAS REVERSED OVER A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATION BETWEEN A SENSE OF INSECURITY AND THE DEMORALIZATION THAT INFLUENCES MIGRATION DECISIONS. IT FURTHER INVESTIGATES THE CAUSES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CHANGE. AS DEMOCRACY SHRINKS, AUTHORITARIANISM EXPANDS, IMPLYING THAT THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS LEADS A COUNTRY TO WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION, CREATING SEVERE SOCIAL INJUSTICES. PEOPLE IN GENERAL BECOME DEMORALIZED AND DECIDE TO MIGRATE OUT. THIS ARTICLE ADDS TO THE BODY OF WORK BY FOCUSING ON WHETHER THE MIGRATION DECISION IS A RESPONSE TO WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION, PREVAILING POLITICAL CONDITIONS, VIOLENCE, CONFLICT, POOR GOVERNANCE, AN ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW AND FREEDOM OR DECLINING OF DEMOCRATIC SPACE IN BANGLADESH.
158	AN ETHICAL APPROACH TO MIGRATION HAS TO FACE THE COMPLEX REALITY OF IRREGULAR IMMIGRATION AS A CHALLENGE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE BORDERS BY SOVEREIGN STATES. THE SITUATION IN EUROPE SINCE 2015 HAS LED TO A RISE OF POPULISM AND TO A POLARIZATION OF THE POLITICAL DEBATE IN MANY COUNTRIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRESENCE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS HAS ALSO TRIGGERED NEW EXPRESSIONS OF SOLIDARITY. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY OF PERSONS AND INSTITUTIONS CONCERNED BY THE NEED FOR HUMANITARIAN AID AND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF APPLICATIONS FOR ASYLUM ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS. THE IDEAL OF HOSPITALITY CAN HELP TO SUPPORT JUST AND FAIR PROCEDURES WITHOUT BEING THE ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS. INDIVIDUAL AND STRUCTURAL DEGREES OF ACTION HAVE TO BE DISTINGUISHED. RELIGIOUS BELIEFS PLAY A PARTICULAR ROLE IN THE ONGOING EUROPEAN DEBATE ON STRANGERS, BORDERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ETHICS OF MIGRATION URGENTLY NEEDS SUCH INSPIRATIONAL RESOURCES IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN THEORETICAL ARGUMENTATION AND PRACTICAL MORALITY.
159	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE RISKS OF PRIVATISED ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD OF TERRORISM PROPAGANDA, STEMMING FROM THE EU CODE OF CONDUCT ON COUNTERING ILLEGAL HATE SPEECH ONLINE. BY SHEDDING LIGHT ON THIS CODE, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF IT MAY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND GIVE RISE TO PRIVATE CENSORSHIP. IN ORDER TO OUTWEIGH THESE RISKS, IT COMPANIES SHOULD IMPROVE THEIR TRANSPARENCY, ESPECIALLY TOWARDS USERS WHOSE CONTENT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. WHERE AUTOMATED MEANS ARE USED, THE COMPANIES SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE IN PLACE SOME FORM OF HUMAN INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO CONTEXTUALISE POSTS. AT THE EU LEVEL, THE COMMISSION SHOULD PROVIDE IT COMPANIES WITH CLEARER GUIDELINES REGARDING THEIR LIABILITY EXEMPTION UNDER THE E-COMMERCE DIRECTIVE. THIS WOULD HELP PREVENT A RACE-TO-THE BOTTOM WHERE INTERMEDIARIES CHOOSE TO INTERPRET AND APPLY THE MOST STRINGENT NATIONAL LAWS IN ORDER TO SECURE AT UTMOST THEIR LIABILITY. THE PAPER FURTHER ARTICULATES ON THE FINE LINE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN 'TERRORIST CONTENT' AND 'ILLEGAL HATE SPEECH' AND THE NEED FOR MORE DETAILED DEFINITIONS.
160	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE NATURE AND INFLUENCE OF INFORMAL SOCIAL NETWORKS IN SOUTH KOREA (YONGO) BY ANALYZING TRUST LEVELS AND NETWORK COHESION. PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON STUDIES ON CHINESE GUANXI, IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT THE FURTHER A NATION DEVELOPS STABLE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS THE MORE THE INFLUENCE OF INFORMAL RELATIONS DECREASES. GIVEN SOUTH KOREA'S POSITION AS A STRONG ECONOMIC POWERHOUSE WITH ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE INFLUENCE OF YONGO SHOULD PLAY AN INSIGNIFICANT ROLE TODAY. WE FIND SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT NETWORK COHESION OF YONGO IS STILL STRONG IN SOUTH KOREA, DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC RISE. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, WE OBSERVE A HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED DEGREE OF GENERAL TRUST AND A CONTINUOUS COMMITMENT TO YONGO TIES AT THE SAME TIME. THESE FINDINGS DOCUMENT RECENT CHANGES IN SOUTH KOREA SUCH AS THE BEGINNING OF ITS MULTICULTURAL OPENING, WHEREAS INFORMAL YONGO TIES, CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL INTERPERSONAL BONDS, STILL REMAIN PRONOUNCED. FOREMOST, WE RECOMMEND CURRENT BELIEFS ABOUT THE CORRELATION OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND DECREASING INFORMAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE RECONSIDERED. WE PROPOSE FURTHER STUDIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW INFORMAL SOCIAL NETWORKS EVOLVE OVER TIME.
161	THE SUPREME COURT DOES NOT CONSIDER PRETEXT RELEVANT TO A FOURTH AMENDMENT VIOLATION IN ALMOST ANY CONTEXT. ALTHOUGH THE COURT'S FOCUS ON OBJECTIVITY HAS DRAWN EXTENSIVE ACADEMIC CRITICISM, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE ATTEMPT TO DISAGGREGATE THE SUBJECTIVE MOTIVES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE THAT MOST THREATEN FOURTH AMENDMENT VALUES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A NEW ROLE FOR MOTIVE IN FOURTH AMENDMENT DOCTRINE BY DRAWING LESSONS FROM ABUSIVE EXECUTIVE ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES IN MODERN AUTHORITARIAN STATES. THE EXPERIENCES OF THOSE SOCIETIES SHOW THAT THE GREATEST RISKS TO THE RULE OF LAW ARISE WHEN THE EXECUTIVE SELECTIVELY ENFORCES THE LAW FOR PURPOSES OF POWER, MONEY, OR DOGMA-A PRACTICE I TERM "AUTHORITARIAN PRETEXT." THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A CORE PURPOSE OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT IS TO PROTECT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN CITIZENS AND GOVERNMENT, AND THAT TO PREVENT AUTHORITARIAN ABUSE AND ARBITRARINESS, THE FOURTH AMENDMENT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED TO PROHIBIT SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT WHEN MOTIVATED BY THE REASONS THAT MOST THREATEN THAT BALANCE. THE AMENDMENT'S TEXT, PURPOSE, AND HISTORY SHOW THAT AUTHORITARIAN PRETEXT SHOULD RENDER A SEARCH OR SEIZURE CONSTITUTIONALLY UNREASONABLE.
162	IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WAVE OF PROTESTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN JUNE OF 2013 AND MARCH OF 2015 IN BRAZIL, THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING THE LEGALITY/LAWFULNESS OF RESISTANCE AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE HAVE TAKEN THE VOICES OF THE INTELLIGENTSIA, MEDIA AND BRAZILIAN PUBLIC OPINION. THE ACCEPTABILITY OF PUBLIC OPINION ON THE USE OF VIOLENCE AS A MEANS OF SEEKING TO MAKE JUSTICE CAUSES, THAT, CURRENTLY, SUCH PRACTICE IS CONDEMNED AS SOMETHING PRIMITIVE AND VIOLATOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, WHICH THEREFORE ALLOWS THE QUESTION, IF THE RIGHT OF RESISTANCE TO OPPRESSION IS WELL REASONED/FOUNDED. BUT DOES THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL ORDER ADMIT THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE OR EVEN THE EXERCISE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE? IF SO, IN WHICH SITUATIONS AND WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH? THAT WAY, AMIDST THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RESTRAINT MECHANISMS OF THE WELFARE STATE AGAINST THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM, THIS RESEARCH HAS AS SCOPE THE QUESTIONING ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF RESISTANCE AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, AS NECESSARY INSTRUMENTS TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
163	"DEZENTRALISIERUNG VON MACHT AND ENTSCHEIDUNGSFINDUNG - EIN INSTITUTIONELLER TREIBER FAR SYSTEMWECHSEL ZUR DEMOKRATIE". REGARDING PROCESSES OF SYSTEM CHANGE TOWARDS DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND MARKET ECONOMY FROM A COMPARATIVE POINT OF VIEW, THE DECENTRALIZATION OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND OF MANAGING PUBLIC AFFAIRS IS ONE IMPORTANT SYSTEM GOAL. BASED ON GERMAN EXPERIENCE IN TWO TIMES OF TRANSFORMATION (1945/49 AND 1989/90), THE ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE USEFULNESS OF TRANSFERRING THESE (MEANWHILE HISTORIC) EXPERIENCES AS A SPECIFIC "LESSON" TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA. OUR CONCLUSION IS THREEFOLD: FIRST, A REFORM OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM SHOULD COMBINE A MAINTAINING VERTICAL HIERARCHY ACTING TOP DOWN WITH LOCAL AUTONOMY WITH EITHER A STRONG OR A WEAK SET OF RESPONSIBILITY. SECOND, AN ELITE CIRCULATION OF SMALL SIZE WHICH INCORPORATES COOPERATIVE PARTS OF OLD ELITES SEEMS TO BE USEFUL; THEREBY RISKS OF OBSTRUCTION CAN BE NEUTRALIZED AND LOCAL RATIONALITIES CAN BE UNLOCKED IN SITUATIONS OF TRANSITION CRISES. THIRD, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT SERVES NOT ONLY AS A "DRIVER" OF DEMOCRATIZATION BUT ALSO FOR OPTIMIZING PEOPLE'S DEMANDS OF FUNCTIONAL EXECUTION OF PUBLIC SERVICES.
164	THE CHINESE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM INCLUDES THE PARTY'S GOVERNING SYSTEM, THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS SYSTEM, THE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM, THE COURT SYSTEM AND THE PROCURATORATE. JUDICIAL POWER IS NEUTRAL, PASSIVE, INDEPENDENT AND FINAL, FEATURES THAT REFLECT THE IRREPLACEABLE NATURE OF ITS ROLE IN NATIONAL GOVERNANCE. THE GROWTH OF JUDICIAL POWER IS DIACHRONIC, COMPLEX AND EVOLUTIONARY, WHICH MEANS THAT ITS CONSTRUCTION WILL BE A TORTUOUS AND DIFFICULT PROCESS. GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE FUNCTIONS OF JUDICIAL POWER IN CHINA AND THEIR IMMEDIATE RESULTS, WE SHOULD FIX OUR GAZE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIALIST COUNTRY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS OF OUR NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM BY TAKING CHECKS AND BALANCE AS THE PRINCIPLE IN THE ALLOCATION OF JUDICIAL POWER, TAKING RIGHTS PROTECTION AS THE HEART OF THE OPERATION OF JUDICIAL POWER, TAKING HARMONIOUS OPERATION AS THE STANDARD FOR GUARANTEEING JUDICIAL POWER, AND CULTIVATING LEGAL CULTURE AS THE FOUNDATION SUPPORTING JUDICIAL POWER. IN OPTIMIZING NATIONAL GOVERNANCE ITSELF, WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN ITS FUNCTIONS OF ADAPTATION, INTEGRATION, GOAL ATTAINMENT AND LATENCY.
165	CHINA IS CHANGING THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN EAST ASIA. IT IS NOT ONLY A MATTER OF A POWER TRANSITION, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF A CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. CHINESE PEOPLE TEND TO SEE THE WORLD ORDER IN HIERARCHICAL TERMS AS THEY DID FOR CENTURIES; NATIONALISM IS USED AS A TOOL OF NATIONAL INTEGRATION; AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE MILITARY IS WEAKENING. THESE ARE THE FACTORS BEHIND THE RISE OF CHINA. IF THESE TRENDS CONTINUE, A HIERARCHICAL ORDER WITH CHINA AS HEGEMON MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED IN EAST ASIA. IT SEEMS AS IF WE ARE RETURNING TO THE PERIOD BEFORE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN CHINA LED THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY HAS TO BE BASED UPON SUCH PRINCIPLES AS THE RULE OF LAW, PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF CONFLICT, DEMOCRACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH SUCH AN ORDER, JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO THOSE VALUES SHOULD UNITE FIRMLY. CHINA ALSO WOULD BENEFIT VERY MUCH FROM THAT ORDER IN THE LONG RUN.
166	THE TRANSLATION OF SPECIALIZED TEXTS DEMANDS TRANSLATORS TO HAVE A THEMATIC KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO MANY AREAS. IN THE CASE OF THE TRANSLATION OF LEGAL TEXTS, WHERE THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION IS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEMS, A PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATOR SHOULD POSSESS SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW OF BOTH SYSTEMS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPOSE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE FIGURE OF THE FRENCH MINISTERE PUBLIC AND THE SPANISH MINISTERIO FISCAL, AN ORGANISM THAT IN BOTH COUNTRIES HAS AS ITS MISSION THAT OF PROMOTING THE OPERATION OF JUSTICE IN THE DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS SAFEGUARDED BY THE LAW, AS WELL AS THAT OF PROTECTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURTS AND SECURING THROUGH THEM THE SATISFACTION OF SOCIAL INTEREST. TO THIS END, IN A FIRST STAGE WE WILL EXPLAIN HOW THIS ORGANISM IS ARTICULATED AND ORGANIZED IN BOTH SYSTEMS, AND IN A SECOND PHASE WE WILL ANALYZE IF THE EXISTING DIFFERENCES MAY LEAD TO TRANSLATION OR TERMINOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT MAY HINDER THE TRANSLATOR'S WORK.
167	IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT HOW TO EVALUATE ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE'S DEFENSE OF COLONIALISM. SOME SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN THE KEY DOCTRINES OF TOCQUEVILLE'S POLITICAL THEORY AND HIS ENTHUSIASTIC PROMOTION OF THE FRENCH CONQUEST AND COLONIZATION OF ALGERIA. OTHERS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE APPARENT CONTRADICTION CAN BE EXPLAINED BY PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE NUANCES OF HIS WORK OR THE LOGIC OF LIBERALISM. THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES THIS DEBATE BY RECONSTRUCTING TOCQUEVILLE'S THEORY OF MARTIAL LAW, A DIMENSION OF HIS WORK THAT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED. IN A SERIES OF LETTERS, NOTES AND PARLIAMENTARY REPORTS ON ALGERIA, TOCQUEVILLE CRITICIZED OF THE USE OF MARTIAL LAW IN GOVERNING FRENCH CITIZENS AND DEFENDED ITS USE AGAINST NATIVE ALGERIANS. TOCQUEVILLE'S WRITINGS OIL ALGERIA MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE TREATED THE RULE OF LAW NOT AS A NATURAL RIGHT HELD BY ALL PEOPLE BUT RATHER AS A TECHNIQUE OF GOVERNMENT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE IN COMMUNITIES ALREADY UNITED BY SOCIAL TIES.
168	THE COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA INHERITED A DIFFICULT LEGACY OF MASS ATROCITIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE FROM THE WARS OF THE 1990S. THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ASSOCIATION AND ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY WITH RESPECT TO SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, AND CROATIA INCORPORATES THE PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH WAR CRIMES ONLY INSOFAR AS IT REQUIRES FULL COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. WHILE TRANSFERS OF WAR CRIMES SUSPECTS TO THE HAGUE HAVE DOMINATED EU RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN BALKANS, DOMESTIC TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS SUCH AS TRUTH-TELLING INQUIRIES AND WAR CRIMES TRIALS HAVE BEEN IGNORED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE REMAINS BOTH REMOTE AND HEAVILY CONTESTED ACROSS THE REGION, AND IS OFTEN USED TO RADICALISE NATIONALIST SENTIMENTS INSTEAD OF FACILITATING RECONCILIATION AMONG ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. THE GOALS OF EU CONDITIONALITY IN EX-YUGOSLAVIA - PROMOTING RECONCILIATION AND CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION - CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCED IF MECHANISMS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ARE EMPLOYED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, ARTICULATING TRUTH AND REBUILDING THE RULE OF LAW BY ESTABLISHING WAR CRIMES ACCOUNTABILITY FROM WITHIN.
169	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, TERMS SUCH AS STATE COLLAPSE AND FAILED STATES ARE BECOMING FAMILIAR, REGULARLY USED IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS TO DESCRIBE A NEW AND FRIGHTENING CHALLENGE TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. THE DRAMATIC EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER I I HAVE PUSHED THE ISSUE OF COLLAPSED STATES FURTHER INTO THE LIMELIGHT. THIS ARTICLE HAS TWO AIMS. FIRSTLY, IT EXPLAINS THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PHENOMENON OF STATE COLLAPSE. IN THE EARLY POST-COLD WAR PERIOD, STATE COLLAPSE WAS USUALLY VIEWED AS A REGIONAL PHENOMENON, AND CONCERNS WERE MAINLY LIMITED TO HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LOCAL POPULATION AND DESTABILIZING EFFECTS ON NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. NOW, STATE COLLAPSE IS SEEN IN A MORE GLOBAL CONTEXT, AND CONCERNS ARE DIRECTED AT THE EMERGENCE OF GROUPS OF NON-STATE ACTORS WHO ARE HOSTILE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND INTERESTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY SUCH AS PEACE, STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. SECONDLY, THE ARTICLE OFFERS SOME OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PHENOMENON OF STATE COLLAPSE FOR PEACE-BUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTION.
170	THANKS TO THE NATURE OF ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM, MEXICO HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION. YET RECENT CHANGES IN THE PATTERNS OF CORRUPTION AND BROADER POLITICAL CHANGES HAVE SEEMINGLY ALTERED THE EQUATION. ANGER OVER RAMPANT CORRUPTION UNDER PRESIDENT CARLOS SALINAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE STUNNING ELECTORAL DEFEAT OF THE PRI IN JULY 1997, WHILE THE OUTCOME, THE PRI'S LOSS OF MAJORITY CONTROL OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WILL ADD TO THE STRUCTURAL PRESSURES THAT HAVE MOUNTED IN RECENT YEARS AGAINST INSTITUTIONALISED CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THESE TRENDS. IT SETS OUT THE HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN MEXICO, EXAMINES CHANGES IN THE INCIDENCE AND PATTERNS OF CORRUPTION, AND DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF RECENT POLITICAL CHANGES ON THIS ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM. THOUGH CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC REGARDING THE IMPACT OF MEXICO'S POLITICAL BREAKTHROUGH ON EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF CORRUPTION, THE ESSAY CONCLUDES ON A CAUTIOUS NOTE, HIGHLIGHTING THE DIFFICULTIES OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND REINING IN CORRUPTION.
171	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION WITH EMPHASIS ON THE EASING OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE REFLEXES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RETROGRESSION TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON THE INTANGIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CONCEPT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REGRESSION AND THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF PESTICIDES IN BRAZIL AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (RIGHT TO FOOD, HEALTH, ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT, AMONG OTHERS). THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES HOW THE RELAXATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION. THUS, THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE STATES' LINK AND ITS ACTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO GUARANTEE, PROTECT AND PRESERVE FUNDAMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. THE METHOD TO BE USED IS THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE, WITH THE REALIZATION OF A BI-BLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CANNOT HAVE SETBACKS, BEING A LIMITER OF STATE POWER.
172	WITH THE ONSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, COURTS AROUND THE WORLD RAPIDLY SHIFTED TO REMOTE HEARINGS. BALANCING PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES WITH THE NEED TO CONTINUE UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW, WHAT FOLLOWED WAS THE LARGEST, UNFORESEEN MASS-PILOT OF REMOTE HEARINGS ACROSS THE WORLD. FOR COURTS THIS WAS NECESSARILY A TIME OF ACTION, NOT REFLECTION. HOWEVER, AFTER HAVING MAINTAINED COURT OPERATIONS, IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO REFLECT ON THE EXPERIENCE OF REMOTE COURTS AND THEIR USERS DURING AN OTHERWISE UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION. UNLIKE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF REMOTE HEARINGS, THE COVID-19 EXPERIENCE WAS FULLY REMOTE - WHEREBY ALL PARTICIPANTS TOOK PART IN THE HEARING REMOTELY. THE DIFFICULTY IS UNTIL NOW, ALMOST NO PRIOR EMPIRICAL DATA HAS EXISTED ON THIS TYPE OF FULLY REMOTE HEARING WITH THE MAJORITY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH FOCUSED ON THE USE OF AUDIOVISUAL LINKS ('AVLS') TO FACILITATE PARTIALLY REMOTE APPEARANCES WITHIN COURTROOMS. TO BRIDGE THE RESEARCH AND DATA GAP ON FULLY REMOTE HEARINGS, THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE PREVIOUS BODY OF LITERATURE TO BOTH EXAMINE THE COVID-19 EXPERIENCE, AND TO ASSIST IN GUIDING FUTURE RESEARCH AND USE OF REMOTE HEARINGS.
173	IN RECENT DECADES, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS OF MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. AT THE LEGAL LEVEL, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS ARE DESIGNED AS ORGANS INTENDED TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE THE NORMATIVE CONSTITUTION. AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL, THEY ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE PROTECTION OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE STABILITY OF A DEMOCRACY DOES NOT ONLY DEPEND ON EFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS, BUT ALSO ON ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. USING DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL SURVEY, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PUBLIC VIEWS OF THE COURT SYSTEM IN AT LEAST TWO DIMENSIONS: PERCEPTIONS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND PERCEPTIONS OF JUDICIAL FAIRNESS. THESE EFFECTS, HOWEVER, DECREASE WITH THE AGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. GIVEN THE CORE ROLE THAT DIFFUSE SUPPORT FOR THE JUDICIARY PLAYS IN THE STABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, PARADOXICALLY, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS MIGHT HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO THE VERY GOAL THAT JUSTIFIES THEIR EXISTENCE: THE PROTECTION OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT.
174	THE TINY HIMALAYAN KINGDOM OF BHUTAN, WHICH HAD REMAINED ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD UNTIL THE 1970S, EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF TRANSFORMATIONAL REFORMS IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM THAT INCLUDED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE COUNTRY'S CENTURY-OLD ABSOLUTE MONARCHY WITH A PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND THE ENACTMENT OF A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION BASED ON WESTERN PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE 'DEMOCRATIZATION' PROCESS WAS UNIQUE, NOT LEAST FOR THE FACT THAT THE IMPETUS FOR CHANGE CAME FROM THE MONARCH, WHO PRESSED AHEAD WITH HIS MODERNIZATION AGENDA IN THE FACE OF PALPABLE OPPOSITION FROM HIS PEOPLE, ARGUING THAT POPULAR DEMOCRACY WAS THE ONLY VIABLE WAY FORWARD FOR BHUTAN IN THE MODERN AGE. THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTION MAKING INVOLVED THE STRIKING OF A DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN TRADITION AND MODERNITY AND ENSURING THAT THE MONARCHY CONTINUED TO PLAY A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS ITSELF RAN SMOOTHLY, IT IS TOO EARLY TO JUDGE THE DURABILITY AND LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF BHUTAN'S NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.
175	THE COLONIAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM 'THE RULE OF LAW' AS APPLIED IN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IN THE HISTORY OF COLONIAL RULE IN AFRICA, COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT WAS AMONG THE MORE BRUTAL AND WIDESPREAD FORMS OF REPRESSION, BUT IT HAS GOT LITTLE HISTORICAL ATTENTION. THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE BANALITY OF THOSE PRACTICES BUT ALSO TO THE FACT THAT THEIR VICTIMS WERE NOT DISTINGUISHED INTELLECTUALS, CHURCH OR UNION LEADERS, WORKERS ON STRIKE OR RADICAL STUDENTS. THEY WERE, MOST OF THE TIME, PEASANTS FROM PLACES DISTANT FROM POLITICAL CAPITALS, RARELY MENTIONED IN NEWSPAPERS, UNKNOWN TO THOSE COMMITTED TO DEFENDING MORE 'IMPORTANT' POLITICAL PRISONERS. AND AFTER THE INDEPENDENCE OF THEIR COUNTRIES THOSE VICTIMS OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT AND IMPRISONMENT HAVE RARELY RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AS PART OF THE ANTICOLONIAL RESISTANCE USUALLY PRAISED IN COMMEMORATIVE CEREMONIES AND PATRIOTIC DISCOURSES. THIS PAPER USES AN (ALMOST) FORGOTTEN EPISODE OF PORTUGUESE COLONIAL VIOLENCE IN ANGOLA, INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF PEASANT WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN, TO QUESTION THE WAY SOCIETIES SELECTIVELY REMEMBER VICTIMS OF REPRESSION.
176	THE MOST RECENT GLOBAL WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC REVERSAL IS MARKED BY EXECUTIVE TAKEOVERS. POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INTERVENTIONS IN DOMESTIC MARKETS AIMED AT RESTRUCTURING THE UNDERLYING POWER DYNAMICS IN SOCIETY HAVE BEEN PART AND PARCEL OF THESE TAKEOVERS. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY BEHIND THE AKP'S COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIAN RULE IN TURKEY AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS LARGER TREND. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE AKP GOVERNMENT HAS BUILT A LOYAL BUSINESS CLASS THROUGH AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENT SINCE 2002. WITH THE AIM OF CONSOLIDATING ITS BUSINESS CONSTITUENCY, THE AKP POLITICIZED STATE INSTITUTIONS (DEBT COLLECTION, TAX AUTHORITIES, PRIVATIZATION, PUBLIC PROCUREMENT) AND ERODED THE RULE OF LAW TO DISTRIBUTE RENTS AND RESOURCES TO ITS SUPPORTERS, TRANSFER CAPITAL FROM ITS OPPONENTS TO ITS SUPPORTERS, AND TO DISCIPLINE DISSIDENTS IN BUSINESS CIRCLES. THESE MECHANISMS ALLOWED THE PARTY TO SKEW THE POLITICAL PLAYING FIELD IN ITS FAVOUR THROUGH ITS ACCESS TO PRIVATE RESOURCES AS WELL AS ITS DISPROPORTIONATE ACCESS TO THE MEDIABUILT BY PRO-AKP BUSINESSMENAND THUS UNDERPINNED THE AKP'S COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.
177	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM OF CORRUPTION, WITH A FOCUS ON BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THIS PROBLEM. WE ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF THE INCIDENCE OF CORRUPTION AS WELL AS THE TOLERANCE OF CORRUPTION. WE USED LOGIT REGRESSIONS THAT UTILISED DATA DERIVED FROM EUROBAROMETER. THE RESULTS STRONGLY SUGGEST GENDER, AGE, AND EDUCATION ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS. WE MAY SAY THAT ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY OUGHT TO BE TARGETED TOWARDS YOUNGER, LESS-EDUCATED, SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE WITH NO CHILDREN. ON THE OTHER HAND, A BETTER-EDUCATED MAN IN HIS EARLY 30S SEEMS TO BE A TYPICAL VICTIM OF CORRUPTION. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THOSE HAVING PROBLEMS PAYING THEIR EXPENSES. FURTHERMORE, CONTACT WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS APPEARS TO BE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES, WITH INTERNET-BASED INTERACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT PERHAPS SERVING AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. THE RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY SEEM TO BE OTHER FACTORS THAT NEGATIVELY CORRELATE WITH THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION WITHIN A COUNTRY.
178	THIS SPEECH WAS DELIVERED BY THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE SUSAN CRENNAN AC AS THE VICTORIA LAW FOUNDATION LAW ORATION 2014 ON 21 MAY 2014 IN THE BANCO COURT OF THE SUPREME COURT OF VICTORIA. MAGNA CARTA CAN BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DOCUMENTS EVER DRAFTED AS IT ESPOUSES MANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND CONSTRAINTS ON THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE FORMED THE FOUNDATION OF COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD. NEARLY 800 YEARS AFTER IT WAS ACCEPTED BY KING JOHN OF ENGLAND, MAGNA CARTA HAS HAD A STRIKING INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHARED CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AUSTRALIA, AND PROVIDES A HISTORICAL BASIS TO MANY OF THE COMMON LAW VALUES WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN GIVEN FORCE THROUGH LEGISLATION OR CASE LAW. THIS SPEECH EXAMINES SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF MAGNA CARTA FROM THROUGHOUT THE AGES, AND CONSIDERS ITS ONGOING SIGNIFICANCE FOR AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION IN PROVIDING A BASIS FOR SOME OF THE IMPORTANT UNWRITTEN ASSUMPTIONS UNDERPINNING THE CONSTITUTION SUCH AS THE SPIRIT OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
179	OVER THE LAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THE CONSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS CHANGED TREMENDOUSLY. AS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD, STATES IN THE REGION ARE DRAMATICALLY ALTERING THEIR CONSTITUTIONS, OFTEN PUTTING IN PLACE INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, SUCH AS CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSIONS. YET DESPITE THE NUMEROUS FORMAL CHANGES, ACTUAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE IN THE REGION HAS BEEN HIGHLY UNEVEN. FOUR AREAS ARE PARTICULARLY CONTESTED: CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING AND DESIGN; INDIVIDUAL AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS; THE ROLE OF THE MILITARY IN CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS; AND THE RULE OF LAW, COURTS AND JUSTICE. HOW STATES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA RESOLVE UNFOLDING CONFLICTS IN THESE FOUR AREAS WILL BE CRITICAL TO HOW CONSTITUTIONALISM EVOLVES IN THE REGION. REPLACING TRADITIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HOW CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS ARE CONTESTED IN THE REGION, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ADVANCE THE SCHOLARLY DEBATE BY DELVING DEEPLY INTO THE DYNAMICS THAT UNDERPIN UNFOLDING CONSTITUTIONALISM TRAJECTORIES AND ASSESSING WHETHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION ARE ACTUALLY DEEPENING CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE IN A WESTERN LIBERAL SENSE OR WHETHER THE MODEL THAT SEEMS TO BE EMERGING IS QUITE DIFFERENT.
180	CONSIDERATION OF THE LAW AND THE LEGAL PROCESS IS ESSENTIAL FOR STUDENTS OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WHO ARE PREPARING FOR RESPONSIBILITIES AS LEADERS, MANAGERS, AND POLICY MAKERS. IN THEIR FOUNDATIONAL COURSES, PUBLIC AFFAIRS STUDENTS ARE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER POLITICAL THEORIES ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FRAMEWORK ON WHICH ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY IS BASED. THEY MAY ALSO HAVE AN OPTION TO STUDY DISCRETE ASPECTS OF THE LAW DEEMED ESPECIALLY RELEVANT TO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AS AGENCY RULEMAKING OR BASIC FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PUBLIC AFFAIRS STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY LAW IN A COURSE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE CONSIDERATION OF LEGAL FOUNDATIONS, A RANGE OF BASIC LAW SUBJECTS THAT PUBLIC OFFICIALS COMMONLY ENCOUNTER, AND PRACTICAL CONCERNS SUCH AS COMPLYING WITH PUBLIC ETHICS LAWS, MANAGING LITIGATION, AND HIRING LAWYERS. WITH THE BENEFIT OF SUCH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH, STUDENTS WILL MORE CLEARLY SEE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF POLICY AND LAW, FURTHER DEVELOP ANALYTICAL AND DECISION- MAKING SKILLS, AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW FROM WHICH THEIR AUTHORITY WILL BE DERIVED.
181	THE STUDY OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S CASE LAW REGARDING THE AREA OF FREEDOM SECURITY AND JUSTICE (AFSJ) IS IN MANY WAYS FASCINATING. IT RELATES TO A NEW FIELD OF EU COMPETENCE, TOUCHES UPON ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND IS INTERTWINED WITH THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. FROM A MORE TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT IS IMPREGNATED WITH ALL THE INSTITUTIONAL DRAWBACKS RESULTING FROM THE EU'S THREE-PILLAR STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL SHORTFALLS RELATED TO THE LACK OF A CLEAR POLITICAL WILL FOR STRONG HARMONISATION. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE ECJ FOLLOWS A BINARY LOGIC, WHICH MAY ALSO APPEAR SOMEHOW CONTROVERSIAL. ON THE ONE HAND IT SHOWS HIGH RESPECT FOR SPECIFIC POLICY CHOICES ENSHRINED BY THE MEMBER STATES IN SECONDARY LEGISLATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE ECJ ENERGETICALLY PUSHES FORWARD ITS OWN VISION OF THE AFSJ. THIS VISION IS ONE WHICH IS LIBERATED FROM THE STRICT THREE-PILLAR LOGIC OF THE EU TREATY, WHERE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW RANK HIGH ON THE AGENDA.
182	THE PURPOSE OF THIS INTRODUCTORY ARTICLE IS TO PUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECONSTRUCTION THAT FOLLOWED THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM IN 1989 IN HISTORICAL AND MACROSOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE 'NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM' IS CONSIDERED THE NOVEL FEATURE OF THE POST-1989 TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, AND IS ANALYTICALLY CONTRASTED WITH THE OLD CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE CLASSIC IDEA OF RULE OF LAW, AND WITH THE IDEOLOGICAL CONSTITUTION-MAKING OF THE INTERVENING ERA. THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AS THE TYPICAL INSTITUTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM IS HIGHLIGHTED. THE CONCEPT OF 'CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS' IS DEVELOPED TO THROW LIGHT ON THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL I RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE VARIATION IN ITS INTERFACE WITH THE LAW IS CONSIDERED ALONG A SPECTRUM RANGING FROM THE 'JUDICIALIZATION OF POLITICS' TO THE 'POLITICIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY'. CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONAL REGIMES ARE COMPARED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DISTANCE FROM IDEOLOGICAL POLITICO-LEGAL REGIMES, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EMERGENCY POWERS OF THE HEAD OF THE STATE CREATES A SITUATION OF 'DUAL LEGALITY', AND IN TERMS OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THEIR MAJOR INSTITUTIONS TO THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY.
183	THE STUDY CONSIDERED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH ALL SIX DISTINCT GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FROM THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS, AS WELL AS A COMBINATION OF THEM, AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN 48 AFRICAN ECONOMIES FROM 2000 TO 2019. THE COUNTRIES WERE CLASSIFIED INTO LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. THE MODELS WERE THEN ESTIMATED WITH PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSION WITH FIXED EFFECTS ESTIMATIONS, AND DUMITRESCU & HURLIN CAUSALITY TESTS AFTER GOING THROUGH ROBUST ECONOMETRIC TESTS. FROM THE OUTCOME, THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH CORRUPTION CONTROL IS ESSENTIAL FOR INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN ONLY MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, AND THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE IN GENERAL ARE RELEVANT TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN AFRICA AS A WHOLE AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH RULE OF LAW ARE RELEVANT TO INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN ALL COUNTRY GROUPINGS.JEL: G20; F62; R50
184	THE TWENTY-YEAR PERIOD OF MODERNIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY UNDER THE LEADER-SHIP OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRIOR TO THE INVASION OF UKRAINE IN Z0ZZ, WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A CONSISTENT TREND TOWARDS A STATIST DOMESTIC ORIENTATION, COUPLED WITH AN INCREASINGLY RADICAL POLICY OF FINANCIAL OPENNESS. DESPITE NUMEROUS DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REFORMS, WHICH WERE ORIENTED TOWARDS FREE-MARKET PRINCIPLES, BEING EITHER REVERSED OR SIGNIFI-CANTLY ALTERED, FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY REFORMS PROVED TO BE MORE ENDURING. IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL OUTCOMES ALONG THE AXIS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ECONOMIC REFORMS ARE INTERRELATED. THE ABSENCE OF A ROBUST RULE OF LAW DOMESTI-CALLY ENABLED THE REVERSAL OF PRIVATIZATION REFORMS, BUT ALSO MADE FINANCIAL OPENNESS POLICIES MORE APPEALING TO POLITICAL ELITES. FURTHERMORE, THE SOCIETY'S EXPECTATION OF WELFARE PATERNALISM ENABLED THE REGIME TO TOLERATE THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF GREATER INTEGRATION BY RELYING ON DISTRIBUTIVE POLICIES RATHER THAN WIDESPREAD REPRESSION. IN CONTRAST, I DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INHERITANCE OF A LESS DEVELOPED WELFARE STATE AND AN OVER-RELIANCE ON REPRESSION LED THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY TO ADOPT A MORE CAU-TIOUS APPROACH TOWARDS FINANCIAL INTEGRATION.
185	FINANCIAL INCLUSIONS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS. WHILE THE SYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION HAVE BEEN WIDELY INVESTIGATED, THEIR ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN IGNORED IN EXISTING LITERATURE, PARTICULARLY FOR EMERGING MARKETS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ESTIMATE THE INDEX OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR 19 COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION FROM 2004 TO 2020. THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS PROXIED BY FIVE INDICATORS, INCLUDING (I) BUSINESS SOPHISTICATION, (II) REGULATORY QUALITY, (III) INVESTMENT FREEDOM, (IV) GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND (V) THE RULE OF LAW. THE ADVANCED PANEL SMOOTH TRANSITION TECHNIQUE ENSURES THAT THE ASYMMETRIC EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION ARE SUBSTANTIATED DEPENDING ON THE INCOME LEVEL ACROSS COUNTRIES IN THE SAMPLE. WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY'S EFFECTS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION ARE ASYMMETRIC DEPENDING ON THE INCOME LEVEL. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS VIETNAM AND OTHER EMERGING NATIONS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION MOSTLY BENEFIT FROM THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO ENSURE MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.
186	DEBATE ON THE CONCEPT OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY MAY BE CONDUCTED IN LIGHT OF VARIOUS THEORIES AND BY MEANS OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITIONS. THE PROTESTANT TRADITION IS RARELY LOCATED IN SUCH A CONTEXT, PARTICULARLY THE DUTCH PROTESTANT TRADITION OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, WHICH STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE COUNTRY AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF PROTESTANT TRADITION IN THE WAKE OF WORLD WAR II. THIS WORK SEEKS TO OUTLINE THE PROTESTANT DEBATE ON THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY BASED ON THE IDEA OF "SPHERE SOVEREIGNTY" DEVELOPED BY HERMAN DOOYEWEERD, A PROPONENT OF THIS STRAIN OF PROTESTANTISM. TO DO SO, IT ANALYZES THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DOOYEWEERD'S THOUGHTS ON THE DEFINITION OF SPHERE SOVEREIGNTY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF STATE AUTHORITY AND ITS LIMITS. A SUMMARY OF HIS POSITION AND ITS CONTEXT IS FIRST PROVIDED BEFORE AN ANALYSIS IS GIVEN OF THE CONCEPT OF SPHERE SOVEREIGNTY. FINALLY, SUCH A CONTEXT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE WIDER DEBATE ON SOVEREIGNTY. THE CONCLUDING ARGUMENT IS THAT DOOYEWEERD'S REFLECTIONS PROVIDED A CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW OPPOSING THAT OF TOTALITARIAN VISIONS, REVEALING HIS RELIGIOUS MOTIVES.
187	IMPACT THIS PAPER PRESENTS EVIDENCE FROM 33 COUNTRIES THAT ADOPTING ACCRUAL ACCOUNTING AND IMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (IPSAS) WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THESE TWO PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING REFORMS CAN SOLVE THE AGENCY PROBLEM BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS AND, BY DOING SO, CAN IMPROVE GOVERNANCE. OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOUR OF POLITICIANS CAN BE REDUCED WITH STANDARDIZED AND HARMONIZED ACCOUNTING INFORMATION. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON TWO KEY ISSUES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE CURRENT PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DEBATE-THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING REFORMS. AFTER INVESTIGATING A SAMPLE OF 33 ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2010-2014, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT STATES WHICH HAVE IMPLEMENTED PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING REFORMS (THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF ACCRUAL BASED ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS) HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THEIR RESULTS SUGGEST A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROLLING CORRUPTION; WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY IS NOT AFFECTED BY SUCH REFORMS.
188	IN THE EARLY 2000S, THE EU INCREMENTALLY APPEARED TO HAVE ESPOUSED A DISTINGUISHING HUMAN SECURITY DISCOURSE. THIS WAS BOUND NOT ONLY TO INFORM ITS CRISIS MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS BUT ALSO TO SHAPE ITS GLOBAL ROLE. TODAY, THE UNION SEEMS TO MOVE TOWARD A GLOBAL STRATEGY BLUEPRINT AND AN ENSUING PUBLIC DISCOURSE. HUMAN SECURITY IS NO LONGER MENTIONED AS A GRAND OBJECTIVE, THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN MOVED TO THE BACKGROUND. IT IS CITED AS AN END OF ONE JUST COMPONENT OF EU GLOBAL STRATEGY. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO MAP OUT HOW RELEVANT EU TEXTS SPEAK ABOUT HUMAN SECURITY AND HIGHLIGHTS BENCHMARKS IN THE CASES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION POLICE MISSION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO. BY FOCUSING ON THE MANDATE AND EFFECTS OF THESE CIVILIAN MISSIONS, IT FINDS THAT THE UNION HAS REFRAINED FROM OPERATIONALISING A HUMAN SECURITY PERSPECTIVE TO DIRECT THEM. ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT TAKEN STEPS TO INTERNALIZE AND TURN HUMAN SECURITY INTO AN OVERARCHING DRIVER OF ITS ENGAGEMENT, ELEMENTS OF HUMAN SECURITY ADVANCEMENT MIGHT BE RECORDED.
189	THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE ONLINE PRIVACY POLICIES OF BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER E-COMMERCE FIRMS IN FIVE INDUSTRIES OF MAINLAND CHINA, TAIWAN, AND HONG KONG. BASED ON THE NEO-INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, WE ALSO TESTED WHETHER THE FOUR INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, (1) TOP MANAGEMENT'S LEGAL EDUCATION, (2) MANAGERIAL ETHICS, (3) RULE OF LAW IN INFORMATION PRIVACY PROTECTION AND (4) PEER PRACTICES, HAD ANY EFFECTS ON E-INFORMATION AND E-COMMUNICATION CONTENT. RESULTS FROM A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF 229 WEBSITES FOUND THAT THE PRIVACY POLICY CONTENTS THAT COMPLIED WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRIVACY STANDARDS WERE LESSER IN MAINLAND CHINA FIRMS THAN THOSE OF TAIWAN AND HONG KONG FIRMS. THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF CONTENTS AMONG THE FIVE INDUSTRIES. THE RESULTS OF REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL FOUR FACTORS ON E-INFORMATION CONTENT. THEY ALSO SHOWED THE IMPORTANCE OF COERCIVE, MIMETIC, AND NORMATIVE ISOMORPHISMS ON E-INFORMATION CONTENT. THE VALIDATION OF NORMATIVE ISOMORPHISM HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGERIAL ETHICS AND LEGAL EDUCATION. OUR FINDINGS SUPPLEMENTED EXTANT LITERATURE WHICH IDENTIFIED ECONOMIC MOTIVE AS THE MAIN FACTOR IN INFLUENCING PRIVACY PRACTICE DISCLOSURES.
190	HUNGARY ADOPTED ITS NEW FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK ON THE LEGAL STATUS OF CHURCHES, RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS AND RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES IN 2011, AS PART OF A NUMBER OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES LEADING TO THE DISMANTLEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. IN RELATION TO THE NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK OF STATE-CHURCH RELATIONS, MUCH ASSESSMENT SO FAR FOCUSED ON HOW THE INSTALLMENT OF A "PLURALIST SYSTEM OF STATE CHURCHES" LED TO AN INSTITUTIONAL AND PARTLY MORAL ESTABLISHMENT, JEOPARDIZING AND CURTAILING THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF NON-ESTABLISHED RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN LESS INVESTIGATED HOW THE "PLURALIST SYSTEM OF STATE CHURCHES" AND RELATED CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AFFECTED A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS (E.G. THE RIGHT TO PRIVATE AND FAMILY LIFE OR THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION) AND THE POSITION OF TRADITIONAL CHURCHES, ESPECIALLY, IN VIEW OF THEIR AUTONOMY. THE PAPER INTENDS TO SHOW THAT THE CLOSE ENTANGLEMENT OF THE STATE AND ITS TRADITIONAL CHURCHES LED TO THE DETERIORATION OF THE PROTECTION OF A NUMBER OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE IT ALSO UNDERMINED THE AUTONOMY OF THESE CHURCHES.
191	GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND HAS PROPOSED IN THE WORKS OF VARIOUS THINKERS. BY EXAMINING THE DIFFERENT THEORIES, WE ARE GOING THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY, REQUIRED FOR SURE NON-INFRINGEMENT ANY COMMUNITY OF HUMAN BEINGS. THE THOUGHT OF IMAM ALI ALSO HOW THE RULE AND GOVERNANCE IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER, HAS BEEN ATTENDING. THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM RESEARCH ON NOBLE NAHJOLBALAGHE AND TO ASSESS COMPONENTS OF GOVERNANCE HAD PAID FROM THE SIGHT OF IMAM ALI. USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, STATEMENTS RELATED TO GOVERNANCE DERIVED FROM NAHJOLBALAGHE AND THEN ENCRYPT THE DATA AND USING THE SOFTWARE SPSS, THE DATA HAVE BEEN ANALYZING. THE FINAL STUDY EXTRACTION AND COMPILATION OF ELEVEN COMPONENTS: THE RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE, AND ANTI-OPPRESSION, EQUALITY, PARTICIPATION, SELF-REGULATORY INSTEAD OF MONITORING PEOPLE, PREPARING THE GROUNDWORK TO MOVE PEOPLE TOWARD GOD, CLARIFYING PUBLIC OPINION, PREPARATION FOR A HEALTHY AND DYNAMIC ECONOMY, MANAGE LIFE'S VALUE OF A POOR CLASS OF SOCIETY, SOCIAL SECURITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO GOD AND THE PEOPLE. THESE ARE INDICATORS THAT IMAM ALI BELIEVED ARE REQUIRED FOR "GOOD GOVERNANCE" IN THE SOCIETY.
192	EUROPEANIZATION, FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, DENOTES THE PROCESS BY WHICH NATIONAL RULES AND STRUCTURES ARE INFLUENCED BY EU LAW AND CASE LAW. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS A CRUCIAL FIELD OF LAW AFFECTED BY THE EU. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, DEVELOPED IN ALL MEMBER STATES TO SAFEGUARD THE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW BY THE GOVERNMENT, ARE NO EXCEPTION TO THIS. BY EXAMINING THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS IN TWO MEMBER STATES, NAMELY THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS TO WHAT EXTENT NATIONAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE CASE LAW OF THE CJEU AND WHETHER THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION IS REFLECTED IN THE CORRESPONDING NATIONAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES. THIS ASSESSMENT IS COMPARED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AS DEVELOPED BY THE CJEU, AFTER WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE COURT ON THE POSSIBLE (DIS) SIMILARITIES IS DISCUSSED. IN THE SECOND PART, THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THE THEORY OF LEGAL AUTONOMY AND ITS PORTRAYAL OF THE COURT AS AN INTEGRATION ACTOR, AND ITS RELATION TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE CJEU ON THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES.
193	RATHER THAN LOOKING INWARDS AND NURSING EXCLUSIVELY EUROPEAN INTERESTS, ONE OF THE RECENT LAUDABLE ACTIONS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAS BEEN ITS FOCUS ON THE TRAGIC FATE OF KASHMIRIS. THE PARLIAMENT HAS DECIDED THAT IT OUGHT TO HELP HUMANITY BY CONTRIBUTING TO THE END OF THIS FESTERING DISPUTE, CATEGORISED AS "A DYNAMITE UNDER THE SOUTH ASIAN PEACE." IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE GENESIS OF THE KASHMIR DISPUTE AND, USING HIS EXPERTISE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, SCRUTINISES VARIOUS ARGUMENTS SURROUNDING THIS DISPUTE. THE UPSHOT OF HIS ANALYSIS IS THAT THE MASTER ANOMALY IN THE ARGUMENTS IS THAT DENIERS OF SELF DETERMINATION TO KASHMIRIS WISH TO ECLIPSE THE "RULE OF LAW", AND AVOID APPLYING THE PARTITION RULES (PATENTLY REGULATING THE DIVISION OF THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT ON RELIGIOUS LINES). THEY HIJACK THE DISCUSSION TO SECULARISM AND DEMOCRACY IN INDIA VERSUS MILITARY RULE AND RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM IN PAKISTAN CLEARLY POST-PARTITION DEVELOPMENTS. THE MASTER ANOMALY HAS CLOUDED THE LEGAL FORCE OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS AND THE LEGAL EFFECT OF BINDING PLEDGES OF THE COMPETENT HEADS OF STATE, UNDERMINING THE "PACTA SUNT SERVANDA" PRINCIPLE.
194	AS FAR AS WE CAN ASSESS THE PRESENT TRENDS WITH OUR LIMITED PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES, RUSSIA DOES NOT SEEM TO BE HEADING TOWARDS DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET ECONOMY. THE DEARTH OF PUBLIC FINANCE, THE SPREAD OF THE GREY ECONOMY, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND THE CONCATENATION OF POLITICS, ECONOMICS AND THE MAFIA BID FOR ECONOMIC POWER BODE OMINOUSLY FOR THE REFORMS THAT HAD ELICITED TRIUMPHANT ENTHUSIASM SOME YEARS AGO. THE DECAY OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND THE RUTHLESS EXPLOITATION OF PUBLIC OFFICES FOR PRIVATE ENDS THAT HAD BEGUN UNDER BREZHNEV HAS ACCELERATED IN THE COURSE AND PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE REFORMS. ORDINARY CITIZENS DISTRUST VIRTUALLY ALL OFFICIAL INSTITUTIONS, ARE NOT READY TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITIES, ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY TAXES AND TRY TO INCREASE THEIR SELF-RELIANCE AND INDEPENDENCE FROM THE STATE. IN A PERVERSE TWIST OF REFORM OBJECTIVES, THE STATE IS FORCED TO TOLERATE ILLEGAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE IT CANNOT SUPPLY ITS DEPENDENTS WITH REGULAR AND SUFFICIENT OFFICIAL INCOME. RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY SEEM MORE REMOTE THAN EVER.
195	THE SANCHI OIL SPILL INCIDENT OCCURRED IN EAST CHINA SEA, IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT SPILT, IS THE LARGEST IN CHINA AND NINTH IN THE WORLD SO FAR. THE EXISTING STUDIES SHOW THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL REGIME ON SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION IS LARGELY PUSHED FORWARD BY A FEW DISASTROUS INCIDENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS PAPER PRESUMES THAT THE SANCHI INCIDENT SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED CHINESE LAW CONCERNING SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION. HOWEVER, AFTER LOOKING INTO THE DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY THE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM IN THIS REGARD, WE FIND THAT: 1) CHINA HAS ALREADY PROACTIVELY ESTABLISHED ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION BEFORE SANCHI INCIDENT ALONG WITH THE GROWING VOLUME OF OIL IMPORT; 2) ONLY A FEW PIECES OF LEGISLATIONS ON PREVENTING AND REDUCING OIL SPILLS ARE DIRECTLY TRIGGERED BY THE SANCHI INCIDENT; AND 3) THE FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, CHINA'S LONG-TERM LEGISLATION PLANS, REFORM OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNANCE, AND OTHERS, HAVE ADDITIONALLY PROMPTED CHINA TO UPDATE ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN THE AFTERMATH OF SANCHI INCIDENT. FURTHERMORE, WE IDENTIFY THAT SOME LEGAL ISSUES DEMONSTRATED BY THE SANCHI INCIDENT REMAIN UNRESOLVED, AS FOLLOWS: 1) CHINA STILL LACKS ADEQUATE CAPABILITIES IN MANY RESPECTS TO RESPOND TO THE OPEN SEA OIL SPILLS; 2) A CLEAR ACTION PLAN IS NECESSARY FOR CHINA TO ENHANCE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION; AND 3) THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER CHINA'S OWN COMPENSATION LAW IS INADEQUATE. THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT CHINA SHOULD LEARN FROM THE SANCHI INCIDENT TO ENHANCE CAPACITY BUILDING ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO OPEN SEA OIL SPILL, TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR COMBATING OIL POLLUTION, AND TO LEVEL UP THE COMPENSATION STANDARDS FOR TANKER OIL POLLUTION.
196	PEACEBUILDING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT UN ACTIVITIES IN PEACE MAINTAINANCE, WHICH IS AIMED AT REINFORCING STATEHOOD IN COUNTRIES AFTER CONFLICT. IT HAS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, RELIES ON A LEGAL BASIS AND COMPRISES COMPLEX ACTIONS IN CONFLICT MANAGEMENT DEVELOPED THROUGH THE UN PRACTICE OF THE LAST DECADES. AS A MATTER OF ANALYSIS, IT HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY APPRAISED AND IMPROVED BY OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES, BUT NOT BY INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO OVERCOME THIS SHORTCOMING AND ENCOURAGE A DISCUSSION ON IT. IT WILL DEAL WITH THE CONCEPT OF PEACEBUILDING, ITS DEVELOPMENT AND LEGAL STATUS, INCLUDING ITS LEGAL LIMITATIONS AND CONNECTED LEGAL PROBLEMS. CUESTIONS OF FEASIBILITY AND NECESSITY, AS WELL AS OF THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND ANALYSIS OF CASES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WORK
197	PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IS WIDELY USED IN CRIMINAL CASES TO SCREEN PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDER BECAUSE INSANITY CAN EITHER EXEMPT THE OFFENDER FROM CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY OR MITIGATE HIS/HER CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT. THE OPERATION OF PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IN CHINA USED TO CARRY A TYPICAL CHARACTERISTIC OF CIVIL LAW TRADITION, BUT RECENT REFORMS HAVE STRENGTHENED THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION AND STRESSED THE REQUIREMENT OF ITS PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. THIS ARTICLE WILL EXPLORE HOW PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IS CONDUCTED, AND HOW THE EXPERT OPINION IS PRESENTED AND EXAMINED AS EVIDENCE IN CRIMINAL TRIALS IN CHINA. PART I WILL GIVE A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IN CHINA'S CRIMINAL CASES. PART II WILL INTRODUCE THE CURRENT LEGISLATION ON PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION IN CHINA. PART III WILL EXPLORE PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT LEGISLATION AND PRACTICE. IN THIS PART, HIGH-PROFILE CASES WILL BE CITED TO ILLUSTRATE LOOPHOLES IN THE PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION LAW AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE OPERATION OF EVALUATION. POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THESE LOOPHOLES OR PROBLEMS WILL ALSO BE EXPLORED. PART IV WILL FOCUS ON THE PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION OF PSYCHIATRISTS' EXPERT OPINION IN CRIMINAL TRIALS. ALTHOUGH EXPERT WITNESSES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COURT IN CHINA, VERY FEW OF THEM TAKE THE STAND IN PRACTICE. THIS PART WILL DISCUSS WHY REFORMS KEPT FAILING AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO BRING EXPERT WITNESSES TO COURT. PSYCHIATRISTS ARE IMPORTANT EXPERT WITNESSES; THE DISCUSSION OF LIVE PSYCHIATRISTS WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE APPEARANCE OF ALL THE EXPERT WITNESSES IN CHINESE CRIMINAL TRIALS.
198	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CHANGE IN INTERPRETATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY IN LIBERAL THOUGHT IN RUSSIAN IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. FROM THE CLASSICAL NEGATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF FREEDOM AS NONINTERFERENCE OF THE STATE IN A PERSON'S PRIVATE LIFE, THE NEW LIBERALISM TRANSITIONED TO A POSITIVE INTERPRETATION OF FREEDOM AS THE STATE'S ENSURING OF CONDITIONS FOR CITIZENS TO ENJOY EQUAL FREEDOM. THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL INTERPRETATION OF EQUALITY AS THE ABSENCE OF VARIOUS SOCIAL PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE IDEA OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. THUS, FORMAL-LEGAL EQUALITY WAS BALANCED WITH SOCIAL EQUALITY. WITH THAT IN MIND, THIS ARTICLE DEVOTES SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE NEW LIBERALS' DEFENSE OF THE RIGHT TO A DECENT LIVING AS A COMPLEX OF PERSONAL SOCIAL RIGHTS, AS A RIGHTS CLAIM THAT ALLOWS EVERY CITIZEN TO DEMAND A MINIMUM OF SOCIAL BENEFITS FROM THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT EARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY LIBERALS PROPOSED A QUALITATIVELY NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL, ONE THAT AFFIRMED THE MUTUAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE AND ENTAILED THE EXPANSION OF THE LATTER'S SOCIAL FUNCTIONS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT EARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY LIBERALISM SUBSTANTIATED THE IDEA OF A LEGAL SOCIAL STATE FOR WHICH IMPLEMENTATION HAS PROVEN THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK OF THE CURRENT STAGE OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
199	ON THE BASIS OF A GLOBAL FIRM-LEVEL DATASET OF CHINESE AND INDIAN ACQUISITIONS, THIS PAPER ANALYZES HOW COUNTRY-, INDUSTRY- AND FIRM-SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS AFFECT THEIR LOCATION CHOICE. USING CONDITIONAL LOGIT MODELS, THE IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT OF THE MARKET AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THE NATURAL RESOURCE AND STRATEGIC ASSET ENDOWMENT OF HOST COUNTRIES ARE ASSESSED FOR ACQUISITIONS IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES, IN PARTICULAR, THE MINING AND HIGH-TECH SECTORS. WHILE BETTER RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT FOR INDIA'S ALTHOUGH NOT FOR CHINA'S ACQUISITIONS, POLITICAL STABILITY PROVES TO BE A NEGATIVE ESTIMATOR FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. YET THIS COUNTER-INTUITIVE EFFECT IS FADING WHEN THE DEAL IS LARGE, AND THE PROFITABILITY OF THE TARGET IS HIGH. HOWEVER, IN THE MINING INDUSTRY, CHINESE AND INDIAN ACQUISITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE IN RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES WITH UNSTABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS, POOR RULE OF LAW, AND DEFICIENT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THIS SENDS AN ALARMING MESSAGE THAT CHINESE AND INDIAN CORPORATIONS INVEST IN COUNTRIES WITH POOR LEGAL SYSTEMS AND MORE CORRUPTION WHEN ACQUIRING ASSETS ABROAD IN THE MINING INDUSTRY. THIS CAN BE STRATEGICALLY MOTIVATED AS THESE COMPANIES INVEST IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THEIR OWN INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND, SUCH THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LESS COMPETITION AND A BETTER CHANCE TO SUCCEED. THIS IS ALSO PARTLY DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT SOME OF THEIR ACQUISITIONS IN THE MINING SECTOR IN MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN BLOCKED AND THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DIRECT THEIR INVESTMENTS TO LESS INSTITUTIONALLY STRONG RESOURCE RICH COUNTRIES. BESIDES, THESE COUNTRIES ALSO PREFER INVESTMENTS FROM EMERGING COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS INCLINED TO ATTACH CONDITIONALITY. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THESE COMPANIES ARE APT TO DEAL WITH THESE CONDITIONS. IN THIS RESPECT, COMPANIES FROM INDIA HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF MORE INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE AS COMPARED TO THEIR CHINESE COUNTERPARTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLLING FOR THE ACQUIRING FIRM'S EXPERIENCE DOES NOT YIELD ANY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS. IN MORE TECHNOLOGICAL MARKETS THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT INDIAN FIRMS PREFER TO ACQUIRE COMPETITORS IN LESS COMPETITIVE HOST COUNTRIES, AS INDICATED BY PATENT AND TRADEMARK ENDOWMENTS. HOWEVER, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS DO ATTRACT CHINESE ACQUISITIONS, BUT ONLY IN HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING SECTORS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS RESULT INDICATES THAT CHINESE FIRMS SEEM TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVELY TARGETING TECHNOLOGICAL ASSETS WHILE INDIAN FIRMS PREFER COMPETITORS IN LESS COMPETITIVE MARKETS. INDIAN FIRMS ARE GOING OUT ON THE BASIS OF THEIR EXISTING OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES AND ACQUIRING FIRMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHILE CHINESE FIRMS TARGET MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRY FIRMS.

200	THE STRICT LIMITS ON THE FINANCIALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM IMPEDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL FINANCE. OBJECTIVE NEEDS HAVE DRIVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT MODES OF FINANCIALIZATION, PROVIDING SAMPLES WE CAN ANALYZE IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEXT STEPS IN INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE FINANCIALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND ARISES NATURALLY FROM ITS NATURE AS AN ASSET. WHETHER ONE ACKNOWLEDGES THE LAND'S SOCIAL SECURITY FUNCTION DOES NOT AFFECT ITS FINANCIALIZATION. IN INSTITUTIONAL REBUILDING, THE PARTICULAR CHARACTER OF MORTGAGES ON AGRICULTURAL LAND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. THE MORTGAGE-HOLDER MUST BE A FINANCIAL ORGANIZATION, NOT A NATURAL PERSON OR AN ORDINARY FIRM. THE PERSON MORTGAGING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE THE LAND UNDER THE CONTRACT RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM NEED NOT HAVE A STABLE NON-AGRICULTURAL OCCUPATION OR STABLE SOURCE OF INCOME, OR THE CONSENT OF THE PARTY ISSUING THE CONTRACT. REGISTRATION CONSTITUTES PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF THE SETTING UP OF A MORTGAGE AND IS ALSO THE CONDITION WHEREBY IT COMES INTO EFFECT. THE MORTGAGE CANNOT BE REALIZED BY MEANS OF DISCOUNTING, BUT COMPULSORY MANAGEMENT CAN BE USED TO SUBCONTRACT OR LET THE RELEVANT AGRICULTURAL LAND. THE DEBT CAN THEN BE LIQUIDATED FROM THIS INCOME AND THE LAND RETURNED TO THE MORTGAGOR.
201	LAW IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GROWING FIELD OF DISASTER RESILIENCE. STILL, A DETAILED INQUIRY INTO THE POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW AND DISASTER RESILIENCE REMAINS LARGELY ABSENT FROM THE DISCOURSE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW LEGAL THINKING, APPROACHES, AND INSTRUMENTS CAN ACT AS 'TOOLS' IN ALTERING THE NATURE AND CONDITIONS OF DISASTER RISKS. IT LOOKS AT HOW STATE INSTITUTIONS CAN WIELD THEM AND NON-STATE ACTORS EMPLOY THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN PROCESSES OF CHANGE. MOVING BEYOND A RESILIENCE LITERATURE THAT HAS TENDED TO FOCUS ON LAW IN TERMS OF STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH LEGAL REASONING, PROCEDURE, AND SUBSTANTIVE LAW CAN BE INSTRUMENTALISED TO RESIST SHOCKS, PROVOKE INCREMENTAL ADJUSTMENTS, OR EVEN FOMENT TRANSFORMATIONAL SHIFTS IN UNDERLYING RISK CONDITIONS. IT CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING THAT LAW CAN OFFER BOTH A BREADTH OF INSIGHTS FOR RECONCEPTUALISING HOW POWER INFLUENCES RESILIENCE AND A NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS FOR CHALLENGING THESE POWER STRUCTURES.
202	CYBER SECURITY BECOMES OMNIPRESENT WITHIN THE SOCIETY, STAKEHOLDERS ARE TAKING ACTIONS NECESSARY TO REASSURE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TO ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION. ONE OF THE WAYS SEEMS TO BE TO INCORPORATE CYBER INTO EXISTING FRAMEWORKS FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION. THIS TEXT DEMONSTRATES HOW THE INTRODUCTION OF CYBER STRAINS EXISTING FRAMEWORKS AND DEMONSTRATES CERTAIN MISCONCEPTIONS ON THE CASE STUDY OF THE LEGAL CHANGE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. INTRODUCING CYBER LEADS TO SELECTIVE CHOICE OF SPECIFIC TYPE OF INTERDEPENDENCY, WHILE IT IGNORES OTHER SIGNIFICANT TYPES. THE PAPER OBSERVES LARGE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE MACRO-LEVEL DEFINITIONS AND MICRO-LEVEL PROCEDURES AND CONCLUDES THAT CHANGES IN THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK PRESENT A SECURITIZATION EXERCISE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT ADDED VALUE.

203	SIMPLE SUMMARY ANIMAL WELFARE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN SOCIETY, AND HAVING A STRONG ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION IS PER SE IMPORTANT. HOWEVER, IN ADDITION TO A STRONG LEGISLATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT CAN ENFORCE THE LEGISLATION AND TO HAVE A PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A COORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION. BOTH NORWAY AND SWEDEN HAVE RECEIVED SOME CRITICISM FOR THEIR COORDINATION OF ANIMAL WELFARE CONTROL EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE REACTED TO THIS CRITICISM IN DIFFERENT WAYS. NORWAY HAS CENTRALISED THE COORDINATION, MAKING THE NORWEGIAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY (NFSA) SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANIMAL WELFARE CONTROL. SWEDEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS INSTEAD FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING BETTER GUIDELINES TO BE USED BY THE 21 REGIONAL COUNTY ADMINISTRATION BOARDS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE UNIFORMITY. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE COMPARED THE NORWEGIAN AND SWEDISH WAYS OF COORDINATING ANIMAL WELFARE CONTROL AND IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES AND RELEVANT ORGANISATIONAL PRECONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT COMPLIANCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SWEDEN'S ORGANISATION MAY NEED MORE COORDINATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS, WHILE NORWAY HAS BETTER PRECONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING UNIFORMITY IN ANIMAL WELFARE ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER, IN NORWAY, THE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT BE AN ISSUE, DUE TO NFSA ACTING AS DE FACTO "INSPECTOR", "PROSECUTOR" AND "JUDGE". A KEY ISSUE IN FOOD GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS ACHIEVING COORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES. THIS STUDY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BY SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARING THE GOVERNANCE OF ANIMAL WELFARE IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN, USING PUBLISHED PAPERS, REPORTS, AND LEGAL AND OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION, COMBINED WITH SURVEY AND INTERVIEW DATA GENERATED IN A LARGER RESEARCH PROJECT (ANIWEL). GOVERNING ANIMAL WELFARE INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE RELEVANT ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS AND POLICY AREAS, SUCH AS ETHICAL ASPECTS, CHOICE OF LEGAL TOOLS, COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AND ACHIEVING UNIFORM CONTROL. BASED ON THE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED IN COORDINATING ANIMAL WELFARE IN NORWAY AND SWEDEN, RELEVANT ORGANISATIONAL PRECONDITIONS FOR ACHIEVING UNIFORM AND CONSISTENT COMPLIANCE WERE ASSESSED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SWEDEN'S ORGANISATION MAY NEED MORE HORIZONTAL COORDINATION, SINCE ITS ANIMAL WELFARE MANAGEMENT IS DIVIDED BETWEEN MULTIPLE ORGANISATIONAL UNITS (SWEDISH BOARD OF AGRICULTURE, NATIONAL FOOD AGENCY AND 21 REGIONAL COUNTY ADMINISTRATION BOARDS). COORDINATION IN NORWAY IS MANAGED SOLELY BY THE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY NORWEGIAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY (NFSA), WHICH HAS THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSPECTION AND CONTROL OF FOOD SAFETY, ANIMAL HEALTH, PLANT HEALTH, AS WELL AS ANIMAL WELFARE. THUS, NORWAY HAS BETTER PRECONDITIONS THAN SWEDEN FOR ACHIEVING UNIFORMITY IN ANIMAL WELFARE ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER, IN NORWAY, THE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT BE AN ISSUE, DUE TO NFSA ACTING AS DE FACTO "INSPECTOR", "PROSECUTOR" AND "JUDGE".
204	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE AN EMPIRICAL COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ON CROSS-BORDER SUSPECT WEALTH ISSUES AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO CURB CORRUPTION-RELATED SUSPECT WEALTH. THROUGH THE LENS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (UNCAC) AND THE STOLEN ASSET RECOVERY INITIATIVE (STAR) INITIATIVE, THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT ANTI-CORRUPTION FRAMES AND AS A RESULT, SHEDS LIGHTS ON THE DILEMMAS OF TACKLING SUSPECT WEALTH ON THE GROUND. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER BEGINS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAGNITUDE OF SUSPECT WEALTH; THEN IT COMPARES THE FOCUSES OF THE UNCAC AND THE STAR INITIATIVE. THE AUTHOR DRAWS UPON LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS SUSPECT WEALTH SETTLEMENT CASES TO ILLUSTRATE THE LIMITATIONS OF APPLYING THE INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORKS. FINALLY, THIS PAPER TAKES CHINA AS CASE STUDY TO HIGHLIGHT LESSONS FOR FUTURE ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS. FINDINGS ACCORDING TO THE STAR INITIATIVE, $20-$40BN WORTH OF PUBLIC ASSETS ARE STOLEN VIA CORRUPTION EACH YEAR, AMOUNTING TO 20% TO 40% OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ANNUALLY. BUT THE MOST RECENT DATA ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL ASSETS REPATRIATED FROM OECD COUNTRIES WERE $423M FROM 2006 TO 2012, WHICH WAS ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF ESTIMATED STOLEN ASSETS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THAT TACKLING SUSPECT WEALTH NOT ONLY HAS MORAL VALUE BUT ALSO PROVIDES PRACTICAL BENEFITS FOR COUNTRIES SEEKING DEVELOPMENT FINANCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE UNCAC HAS BROUGHT INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY TO THE FOREFRONT OF TACKLING SUSPECT WEALTH. IT CREATES AN INTERNATIONAL NORM FOR RECOVERING AND REPATRIATING STOLEN ASSETS. BUT DUE TO ITS LOOSE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT, THE UNCAC HAS LEFT LOOPHOLES IN ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICYMAKING, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES LACKING THE RULE OF LAW. BY COMPARISON, THE STAR INITIATIVE TAKES INNOVATIVE APPROACH SUCH AS USING INSOLVENCY FOR ASSET RECOVERY AND COUNTRY-BASED CAPACITY BUILDING TO STRENGTHEN ORIGINATING COUNTRIES' ABILITY TO REPATRIATE ASSETS. BOTH THE UNCAC AND THE STAR INITIATIVE ARE WELL-INTENDED, BUT AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES AND WEAK RULE OF LAW OFTEN CREATE DILEMMA FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS PAPER PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO FURTHER TACKLE SUSPECT WEALTH WITH EXISTING INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORKS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS REDUCING SUSPECT WEALTH CONTRIBUTES TO SOCIETY EQUITY AND RESTORES PUBLIC TRUST BY RECOVERING MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC ASSETS AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT OF UNCAC AND THE STAR INITIATIVE THROUGH A COMPARATIVE LENS. IT DEMONSTRATES HOW RISING AUTHORITARIANISM CAN CREATE DILEMMAS FOR WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION AND SUSPECT WEALTH. FINALLY, IT PROVIDES POTENTIAL POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS FOR NAVIGATING SUCH DILEMMAS VIA SHARED INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS.
205	GOVERNANCE IS THOUGHT TO BE A KEY DETERMINANT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT AND OVERALL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THE MDGS IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. GOVERNANCE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS THE LEAST WELL-UNDERSTOOD ASPECT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS. A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE (HSG) AT NATIONAL AND SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS IS PRESENTED, WHICH HAS BEEN APPLIED IN COUNTRIES OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN. IN DEVELOPING THE HSG FRAMEWORK KEY ISSUES CONSIDERED INCLUDED THE ROLE OF THE STATE VS. THE MARKET: ROLE OF THE MINISTRIES OF HEALTH VS. OTHER STATE MINISTRIES; ROLE OF ACTORS IN GOVERNANCE; STATIC VS. DYNAMIC HEALTH SYSTEMS; AND HEALTH REFORM VS. HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH TO HEALTH. FOUR EXISTING FRAMEWORKS WERE CONSIDERED: WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S (WHO) DOMAINS OF STEWARDSHIP: PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S (PAHO) ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS: WORLD BANK'S SIX BASIC ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE; AND UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (UNDP) PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE PROPOSED HSG ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING 10 PRINCIPLES-STRATEGIC VISION, PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS ORIENTATION, RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, EQUITY AND INCLUSIVENESS, EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION, AND ETHICS. THE FRAMEWORK PERMITS 'DIAGNOSES OF THE ILLS' IN HSG AT THE POLICY AND OPERATIONAL LEVELS AND POINTS TO INTERVENTIONS FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT. IN THE CASE OF PAKISTAN, WHERE THE FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED, A POSITIVE ASPECT WAS THE GROWING PARTICIPATION AND CONSENSUS ORIENTATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS, WHILE WEAKNESSES WERE IDENTIFIED IN RELATION TO STRATEGIC VISION, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY AND RULE OF LAW. IN USING THE HSG FRAMEWORK IT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE VALUE DRIVEN AND NOT NORMATIVE AND ARE TO BE SEEN IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT: AND THE FRAMEWORK RELIES ON A QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND DOES NOT FOLLOW A SCORING OR RANKING SYSTEM. IT DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS AID EFFECTIVENESS BUT PROVIDES INSIGHT ON THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE EXTERNAL RESOURCES AND HAS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF GLOBAL HEALTH GOVERNANCE ON NATIONAL HSG AS THE SUBJECT ITSELF GETS BETTER CRYSTALLIZED. THE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE MINISTRIES OF HEALTH AND STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IS AT THE HEART OF THIS FRAMEWORK. THE FRAMEWORK HELPS RAISE THE LEVEL OF AWARENESS AMONG POLICYMAKERS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HSG. THE ROAD TO GOOD GOVERNANCE IN HEALTH IS LONG AND UNEVEN. ASSESSING HSG IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP; THE CHALLENGE THAT REMAINS IS TO CARRY OUT EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN VASTLY DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
206	SOCIAL COOPERATION IS CRITICAL TO A WIDE VARIETY OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. FOR THIS REASON, INTERNATIONAL DONORS HAVE EMBRACED INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF COMMUNITIES TO SOLVE COLLECTIVE-ACTION PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS. WE EXPLOIT THE RANDOM ASSIGNMENT OF A DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN LIBERIA TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS. USING A MATCHING FUNDS EXPERIMENT WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN ALTER COOPERATION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, WE OBSERVE EFFECTS ONLY IN COMMUNITIES IN WHICH, BY DESIGN, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN FACED THE COLLECTIVE ACTION CHALLENGE. FOCUSING ON MECHANISMS, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT PROGRAM EFFECTS WORKED THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN MOBILIZATION CAPACITY THAT MAY HAVE ENHANCED COMMUNITIES' ABILITY TO COORDINATE TO SOLVE MIXED GENDER PROBLEMS. THESE GAINS DID NOT OPERATE IN AREAS WHERE ONLY WOMEN TOOK PART IN THE MATCHING FUNDS EXPERIMENT, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY COULD RELY ON TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS UNAFFECTED BY THE EXTERNAL INTERVENTION. THE COMBINED EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE IMPACT OF DONOR INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE COOPERATION CAN DEPEND CRITICALLY ON THE KINDS OF SOCIAL DILEMMAS THAT COMMUNITIES FACE, AND THE FLEXIBILITY THEY HAVE IN DETERMINING WHO SHOULD SOLVE THEM.
207	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE LINK BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE PER CAPITA AND SIX INDICATORS OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN AN UNBALANCED PANEL DATA SET CONSISTING OF ALL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD (217 COUNTRIES; DUE TO SOME MISSING DATA, (THIS WAS REDUCED TO 196) USING DATA FROM 1996 TO 2020. IT USES SINGLE-EQUATION GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM) TECHNIQUES AND A VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE (VAR) AND VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL (VECM) APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST A STRONG EFFECT OVER TIME WHEREBY AN INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT REVENUE LEADS TO A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST AN IMPORTANT VIRTUOUS CIRCLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT REVENUE AND GOVERNANCE. AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS MORE THAN OUR PREVIOUS WORK HAS SUGGESTED.
208	AT A TIME WHEN THE CHANGING FACE OF CONTRACT LAW IN THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE ORGANISATION FOR THE HARMONISATION OF BUSINESS LAW IN AFRICA, AS EVIDENCED BY THE PRELIMINARY DRAFT OHADA UNIFORM ACT ON CONTRACT LAW, IS AT THE CENTRE OF, AT TIMES IMPASSIONED, SCHOLARLY DEBATE, AN EMPIRICAL SEARCH FOR OBJECTIVE CRITERIA BY WHICH TO ASSESS THE PERTINENCE AND APPROPRIATENESS OF ADAPTING THE UNIDROIT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS TO THIS REGIONAL LEGAL ORDER SEEMS BOTH USEFUL AND NECESSARY. HOW DO THESE PRINCIPLES FIT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS REGIONAL BODY OF RULES? CAN A COMPARISON BE MADE WITH THE MUCH WIDER LEGAL FRAMEWORK AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, TO ESTABLISH WHAT ROLE THE PRINCIPLES MIGHT PLAY IN CONTRACT LAW REFORM WITHIN OHADA? ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF APPROACHING SUCH AN UNDERTAKING IS TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICES OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATORS AND ESPECIALLY, THE IMPACT OF THE PRINCIPLES ON CONTRACT PRACTICE AND ARBITRATION. THIS STUDY SETS OUT TO ANALYSE WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN AS ARBITRAL "JURISPRUDENCE". ONE OF OUR FIRST FINDINGS IS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE NOW REGULARLY REFERRED TO IN ARBITRATION, PROBABLY OWING TO THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN BE USED. 54 ARBITRAL AWARDS HANDED DOWN BETWEEN 2002 AND 2004 BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS APPLYING THE ICC RULES OF ARBITRATION ARE EXAMINED HERE (MOST OF THEM REFERRING TO CASES INVOLVING SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE), THAT IS 5.5% OF ALL THE AWARDS RENDERED DURING THE PERIOD IN QUESTION (THIS MEANS THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE THE RULES MOST OFTEN REFERRED TO OF ALL THE LAWS IN THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES). MOST OF THE REFERENCES TO THE PRINCIPLES ARE MADE AT THE AWARD STAGE RATHER THAN IN THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATION, THE APPLICABLE LAW CLAUSE OR THE ARBITRATOR'S TERMS OF REFERENCE. THE PRINCIPLES APPEAR TO BE INCREASINGLY CALLED UPON BY ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE DOMESTIC APPLICABLE LAW IS DETERMINED TO CORROBORATE, SUPPLEMENT OR TEMPER THE LEGAL SOLUTION RESULTING FROM STRICT APPLICATION OF A GIVEN STATE LAW; THE PRINCIPLES MAY ALSO BE A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION TO IDENTIFY THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ONE OF THE PARTIES WOULD LIKE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO ADOPT AS THE RULE OF LAW APPLICABLE TO THE LITIGATION. AS THE ACTUAL CASE MIGHT BE, THE PRINCIPLES ARE IN THAT CASE USED AS A GENERAL OR PARTICULAR RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, SINCE THERE ARE NO CLEAR-CUT GROUNDS FOR INVOKING THE PRINCIPLES, THE QUESTION OF THE UNIVERSAL APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES ARISES. TWO SETS OF CONSIDERATIONS MAY ASSIST IN SUGGESTING A FIRST RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION: THE FIRST OF THESE ARE OF A SUBJECTIVE NATURE AND REFER TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE, THE ACTORS ON THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STAGE, INVOLVED IN APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES - HERE WE FIND THAT IN MOST CASES, THE PRINCIPLES ARE INVOKED OR APPLIED WHEN THE PARTIES IN THE DISPUTE, THE ARBITRATORS OR THE ARBITRATION CENTRE HAVE A LINK WITH EUROPE. IN ADDITION TO THESE SUBJECTIVE CONSIDERATIONS, THERE ARE OBJECTIVE CONSIDERATIONS - WITH WHICH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS OPERATORS ARE USUALLY MORE FAMILIAR - INVOLVING THE GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES. A LARGE NUMBER OF AWARDS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE "INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED". SOME FEW AWARDS ON THE OTHER HAND CHALLENGE THEIR APPLICATION ON THE GROUNDS THAT SOME INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM. UNIDROIT MAKES MUCH OF THE WORLDWIDE CALLING OF ITS PRINCIPLES (IN THIS CONTEXT, RECOURSE TO THE PRINCIPLES IS PRESENTED AS A MEANS OF DIRECT UNIFICATION OF THE LAW, WHERE THE PRINCIPLES COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF ANY OTHER RULE OF LAW, OR OF INDIRECT UNIFICATION OF THE LAW WHERE THEY ARE USED TO FILL A GAP IN ANOTHER APPLICABLE TEXT THAT IS SILENT ON THE POINT AT ISSUE), BUT THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO DATE MIGHT SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT THEIR VOCATION IS FIRST AND FOREMOST EUROPEAN. NEVERTHELESS, THE CONSTANT RISE IN THE NUMBER OF AWARDS THAT REFER TO THE PRINCIPLES WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE INVOKED IS A QUESTION OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN OF A CONSCIOUS DETERMINATION TO RESTRICT THEIR SCOPE OF APPLICATION.
209	CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERS WERE IN MANY INSTANCES THE FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE SO-CALLED 'EUROPEAN HUMANITARIAN REFUGEE CRISIS'. FROM 2015 ONWARDS, THEY WERE CELEBRATED BY SOME AS HEROES. MEANWHILE, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, NATIONAL AND EU LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SERVED TO RELABEL CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS ACROSS A RANGE OF CONTEXTS AS POTENTIAL 'MIGRANT SMUGGLERS'-DIRECT FACILITATORS OF CONDUITS OF IRREGULAR MIGRANT FLOWS, OR A PULL-FACTOR BY DEFAULT THROUGH THEIR SERVICES. THE SHIFT IN RHETORIC WAS MET WITH A SHIFT IN POLICING PRACTICES: IN ITALY AND GREECE, AMONG OTHER EU MEMBER STATES, HUMANITARIAN ACTS WERE REFRAMED FROM LIFE-SAVING OBLIGATIONS TO BE MET AND COMMENDED, TO ADMINISTRATIVE-AND IN SOME CASES-CRIMINAL RISKS TO BE MONITORED, DETERRED AND PUNISHED. THIS ARTICLE BUILDS ON PREVIOUS RESEARCH TO CONSIDER HOW SINCE 2018, CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS IN ITALY AND GREECE HAVE FACED INCREASING DEMANDS AND PRESSURES FOR REGISTRATION, COORDINATION AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, AND HOW THESE HAVE PROFOUND REPERCUSSIONS ON HUMANITARIAN AND HUMAN RIGHTS WORK WITH, FOR AND BY REFUGEES AND OTHER MIGRANTS. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES FOUR MAIN OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF THE POLICING OF HUMANITARIAN ACTORS AS A STRATEGY TO PREVENT MOBILITY OF REFUGEES AND OTHER MIGRANTS. FIRSTLY, SUCH MEASURES POSE A THREAT TO CIVIL SOCIETY'S INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY FROM GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE; IN DOING SO, THEY IMPACT THE EFFICIENCY OF OPERATIONS AND DISINCENTIVIZE CERTAIN HUMANITARIAN ACTORS FROM CONDUCTING LIFE-SAVING WORK. SECONDLY, THEY HAVE REPERCUSSIONS ON TRUST BETWEEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY WHICH MAY LESSEN THE CHANCES OF MIGRANTS AND THOSE THAT SERVE THEM FROM SHARING CRUCIAL INFORMATION TO STOP AND INVESTIGATE ONGOING VIOLENT CRIMES. THIRDLY, THIS STRATEGY LEADS TO THE POLITICIZATION OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH UNDERMINES PUBLIC FAITH IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. FINALLY, RESOURCES CHANNELLED INTO INVESTIGATING CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS FUNNEL AWAY RESOURCES FROM THE FOCUS ON HIGH-PROFILE CRIMINALITY. GIVEN THE PERVASIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES COMMITTED AGAINST IRREGULAR MIGRANTS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS, WE ARGUE THAT THIS MISDIRECTED POLICY EQUATES TO PICKING 'LOW-HANGING FRUIT' WHILE THE ORCHARD BURNS.
210	THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO MAKE VISIBLE THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR THE EXCEPTION THAT IS FOUND IN MANY OF THE SECTORIAL NORMS OF OUR LEGAL-ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM (FROM PUBLIC SAFETY LEGISLATION TO MARITIME RESCUE LEGISLATION, FROM FORESTRY LEGISLATION TO NUCLEAR RISK LEGISLATION) AND WHICH ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACT ORDINARILY IN THE FACE OF EMERGENCIES AND RISKS. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO HAS HISTORICAL ROOTS IN TERMS OF THE WAY IN WHICH POWERS ARE ATTRIBUTED AND THE TYPE OF MEASURES ENVISAGED, CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM STATES OF EMERGENCY TO PRESERVE PUBLIC ORDER. THE FACT THAT CRISES OF VARIOUS KINDS, WHICH ARE INHERENT TO OUR SOCIAL, POLITICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC MODEL, ARE BECOMING CHRONIC, FORCES US TO RETHINK HOW TO COMBAT THEM. WE ARE FACING SYSTEMIC THREATS THAT MUST BE CHANNELED WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF DEMOCRATIC BALANCES, POWER SHARING AND CITIZENS' RIGHTS. COEXISTING WITH GLOBALIZED EXCEPTIONALITY REQUIRES STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, GIVEN THE CLEAR RISK OF NORMALIZING THE CONSTITUTIONAL EXCEPTION. THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE STUDY OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR THE EXCEPTION AND THE PRINCIPLES, SOURCES AND INSTRUMENTS THAT CHARACTERIZE IT.
211	GHANA HAS INHERITED COLONIAL LEGISLATION THAT RECOGNIZES AND REGULATES THE CONSEQUENCES OF MUSLIM FAMILY LAW (MFL). HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, COURTS ALMOST NEVER RECOGNIZE THE NORMATIVE EXISTENCE OF MFL AND SYSTEMATICALLY DISMISS THE CASES ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS WITHOUT DISCUSSING THEIR MERITS. WHAT EXPLAINS THE JUDICIARY'S ATTITUDES TOWARD ISLAMIC LAW? WHY DO GHANAIAN COURTS REFUSE TO ENGAGE WITH MFL IN SUBSTANTIVE TERMS? HOW DOES THIS JUDICIAL POLICY AFFECT GHANA'S PLURI-LEGAL SYSTEM AND ITS MULTIRELIGIOUS DEMOCRACY? DRAWING ON ROBERT COVER'S INSIGHTS AND CONCEPTS FROM "NOMOS AND NARRATIVE," THE PRESENT ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT GHANAIAN COURTS ENGAGE IN "UNDIGNIFIED" JURISPATHY AGAINST ISLAMIC LAW. HAVING INHERITED THE COLONIAL NARRATIVE THAT ISLAMIC LAW IS NOT A NATIVE LAW OF THE LAND, THE JUDICIARY DESTROYS THE LEGAL MEANINGS BUILT AROUND ISLAMIC LAW WITHOUT DISCUSSING WHAT IS AT STAKE. THIS PERPETUATES NORMATIVE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND MUSLIM GROUPS, UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, AND ERODES PUBLIC TRUST IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. UTILIZING THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL INSIGHTS DRAWN FROM THE GHANAIAN CASE, THE ARTICLE URGES SCHOLARS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THEIR INQUIRIES TO INCLUDE INSTANCES OF UNDIGNIFIED JURISPATHY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND STATE-RELIGION RELATIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATES IN PLURI-LEGAL SOCIETIES.
212	CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOWS NOT ONLY INVOLVE CROSS- BORDER TRADE ISSUES, BUT ALSO SEVERELY CHALLENGE PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION, NATIONAL DATA SECURITY, AND THE JURISDICTION OF JUSTICE AND ENFORCEMENT. AS THE CURRENT DIGITAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS COULD NOT ACCOMMODATE THESE CHALLENGES, CHINA HAS INITIATED THE CONCEPT OF SECURE CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOW AND HAS LAUNCHED A DUAL-TRACK MULTI-LEVEL REGULATORY SYSTEM, INCLUDING CONTROL SYSTEM FOR OVERSEAS TRANSFER OF IMPORTANT DATA, SYSTEM OF CROSSBORDER PROVISION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND SYSTEM OF CROSS-BORDER DATA REQUEST FOR JUSTICE AND ENFORCEMENT. TO EXPLORE A GLOBAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOWS, LEGITIMATE AND CONTROLLABLE CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOWS SHOULD BE PROMOTED, SUPERVISION SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED BASED ON RISK CONCERNED, AND THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE COORDINATED AT HOME AND ABROAD TO PROMOTE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY. TO THIS END, THE KEY IS TO BUILD A COMPATIBLE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, WHICH INCLUDES CLARIFYING THE SCOPE OF IMPORTANT DATA TO DEFINE THE "NEGATIVE LIST" FOR PREVENTING NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS, IMPROVING THE CROSS-BORDER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION RIGHTS AND INTERESTS TO EASE PRE-SUPERVISION PRESSURE, AND FOCUSING ON DATA ACCESS RIGHTS INSTEAD OF DATA LOCALIZATION FOR UPHOLDING THE JURISDICTION OF JUSTICE AND ENFORCEMENT.
213	IN THIS PAPER WE ANALYZE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN BRAZIL REGARDING NATURAL RESOURCES EXPLORATION, PARTICULARLY OIL. GOVERNANCE QUALITY IS REFLECTED IN FIVE INDICATORS FOLLOWING THE APPROACH OF THE WORLD BANK: POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. WE HIGHLIGHT THE MAIN GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES FACED BY THIS COUNTRY WHICH CAN HINDER ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY CAN INFLUENCE OIL EXPLORATION. THE FIRST PROBLEM DETECTED IS THE POLITICAL INTERFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT. AS GOVERNMENTS CHANGE, SO DO ENVIRONMENTAL PRIORITIES, WHICH RAISES IMMENSE COSTS. THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT, DESPITE THE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION, ITS EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS HARD. THIS HAPPENS DUE TO LOW GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS LEVELS. FINALLY, THE LACK OF POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES INCREASES THE RISK OF CORRUPTION. HENCE, IT APPEARS NECESSARY FOR BRAZIL TO CARRY OUT A SELF-ASSESSMENT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND TRACE INDEPENDENT PATHS FOR TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING, WE DID NOT FIND AN EVIDENT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND DATA ON OIL PRODUCTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS. (C) 2022 THE AUTHOR(S).

214	GLOBALISATION, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN WIDELY RECOGNISED IN THE LITERATURE TO BE CAUSALLY IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. MOST OF THE AVAILABLE STUDIES, HOWEVER, TREAT MEASURES OF THESE DETERMINANTS EITHER SEPARATELY OR AS SUBSTITUTES. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY THE INCOME EFFECTS OF BORDER OPENNESS TO MIGRATION, EDUCATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW (OUR PROXIES FOR GLOBALISATION, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND INSTITUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY). USING CROSS-COUNTRY DATA COVERING ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD, AND EMPLOYING INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES FOR ALL THREE FACTORS, WE ESTABLISH THAT THEY EACH HAVE A ROBUST, POSITIVE, AND STRONG ASSOCIATION WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE THEN CONSIDER WHETHER THERE ARE ANY USEFUL INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN THE THREE FACTORS IN EXPLAINING INCOME. ON THE INTERACTION EFFECTS, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE IMPACT ON INCOME OF: (I) MIGRATION CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CULTIVATING GOOD INSTITUTIONS BUT THIS EFFECT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE EDUCATION LEVEL; (II) EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVELS OF MIGRATION AND INSTITUTIONS; AND (III) INSTITUTIONS IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY RAISING THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION BUT IS NOT INFLUENCED BY MIGRATION LEVEL. OUR PAPER MAKES A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION AS THE FIRST INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECTS OF MIGRATION, EDUCATION, AND INSTITUTIONS JOINTLY AND AS COMPLEMENTS.
215	HOW DO REMITTANCES AFFECT DEMOCRATIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES? IN THIS PAPER WE RECONCILE DIVERGENT FINDINGS IN THE LITERATURE BY EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF REMITTANCES ON PROCEDURAL AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. REMITTANCES ARE PRIMARILY SENT TO MIDDLE-CLASS INDIVIDUALS AND BYPASS GOVERNMENT CONTROL. YET, GOVERNMENTS IN COUNTRIES RECEIVING REMITTANCES WANT TO TAX THIS REMITTANCE INCOME. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THEREFORE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE FORMAL ECONOMY BY REDUCING THE THREAT OF EXPROPRIATION. IMPROVING PROCEDURAL DEMOCRACY, WHICH ASSURES CITIZENS OF IMPROVED PROPERTY AND RULE OF LAW PROTECTIONS, IS ONE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP SHOULD ONLY BE PRESENT IN MIXED REGIME TYPES, WITH THE DEMOCRATIZING EFFECT OF REMITTANCES WANING AS THE COUNTRY'S LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY OR AUTOCRACY STRENGTHENS. FURTHER, WE EXPECT ELEMENTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, SUCH AS CIVIL RIGHTS AND EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW, TO REMAIN UNCHANGED IN ALL REMITTANCE-RECEIVING COUNTRIES. THE MIDDLE CLASS AND GOVERNING ELITE ARE LESS INCENTIVIZED TO IMPROVE LIBERAL DEMOCRACY TO LIMIT THE POWER AND MOBILIZATION CAPACITY OF THE POOR AND PREVENT INCREASED REDISTRIBUTION. WE TEST OUR THEORY ON A DATASET OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 1975 THROUGH 2011.
216	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF THE IDEA OF PERSON ON LAW, BASED ON A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CRITICAL VIEW OF EVGUIENI PACHUKANIS, FOR WHOM LEGAL SUBJECT IS MERELY A WAY OF ENABLING CAPITAL DOMINATION, AND THE CRITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF FRANZ NEUMANN, MICHEL FOUCAULT AND JUDITH BUTLER. NEUMANN CENTRALIZES THE PERSON AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW BECAUSE THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCOUNTABILITY OVER DOMINATION. LEGAL SUBJECT IS THEN UNDERSTOOD AS THE CENTRE OF IMPUTATION OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES AND AUTHOR OF NORMS THAT REGULATES HIS LIFE. FOUCAULT ANALYZES POWER AS A DYNAMIC AND CIRCULAR FORM IN SOCIAL RELATIONS. JUDITH BUTLER CONTRIBUTES WITH HER CONCEPT OF RESISTANCE AND ANALYZES THE PRACTICE OF CRITICISM AS A SOCIAL RELATION OF THE SUBJECT TO THE NORMS. WITHIN LAW, WE CAN UNDERSTAND IT AS A CLAIM TO NORMS WITH THE AIM OF TRANSFORMING THEM, IN ORDER ENABLE THE EXPRESSION OF DIFFERENT LIFE FORMS. WE SUGGEST TO ANALYZE, IN SHORT, THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOCIAL REGULATION GRAMMAR AS WELL THE IDEA OF PERSON AS PROPELLANT OF AN AUTONOMOUS AND CONSTANT PROCESS OF NORMATIVE CRITERIA CONSTRUCTION, BASED ON THE FORMULATION OF EQUALITY OF SUBJECTS BEFORE LAW.
217	UKRAINE AND THE WHOLE EUROPE ARE TRULY PROUD OF THE DOCUMENT SIGNED ON 5 APRIL 1710. THE DOCUMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PROTOTYPE OF A CONSTITUTION OF A MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATE. IT IS WIDELY KNOWN AS THE CONSTITUTION OF PYLYP ORLYK. RESEARCHERS CONSIDER THIS DOCUMENT AS THE FIRST UKRAINIAN CONSTITUTION AND THE FIRST EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION WHICH IS BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE STRUCTURE. THIS PUBLICATION PROVIDES THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH ON THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF PYLYP ORLYK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CATEGORIES OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENT, AS WELL AS THE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN ITS INTERPRETATION, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THIS DOCUMENT WAS BASED ON SUCH MODERN PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS: THE RULE OF LAW, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, DEMOCRACY, HUMANISM, SOCIAL JUSTICE, DECENTRALIZATION AND SUBSIDIARITY. THE DOCUMENT CONTAINS LEGAL NORMS DEVOTED TO SUCH INSTITUTES OF CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE, PUBLIC SERVICE LAW, MUNICIPAL LAW, PUBLIC PROPERTY, AS WELL AS TO GOVERNMENTAL REGIMES. PROGRESSIVE IDEAS IMPLEMENTED IN THIS DOCUMENT ARE OF HIGH TOPICALITY EVEN TODAY, AND ARE INTERESTING FOR BOTH SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS.
218	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS THE ROLE OF DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATION AS A POLICY INSTRUMENT FOR DISTRICT AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS IN THE URBAN VILLAGE REGENERATION PROCESS. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATION AND PUBLIC POLICY MAKING, AND THE THEORY OF DELIBERATIVE SYSTEMS. DELIBERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF URBAN VILLAGE REGENERATION IS PART OF A COMPLEX, SCALAR, POLITICAL-ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM, WITH MANY ACTORS WHOSE ACTIVITIES ARE OFTEN NOT ALIGNED. ALTHOUGH THIS CONFIGURATION HAS AUTHORITARIAN TRAITS AND OPERATES LARGELY WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF A STRONG AND WELL-FUNCTIONING RULE OF LAW, IT IS NOT ALL-SOVEREIGN. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING ASPECTS OF URBAN VILLAGE DELIBERATION IS THE WAY THAT REVEALS THE LIMITS OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE IN A MODERN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT. AS WE SHOW, THE PARTY ENCOUNTERS THE SAME PROBLEMS OF TECHNICAL, SOCIAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY, WITH THE ENSUING LIMITS ON VERTICAL STEERING, AS ADMINISTRATIONS IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. USING THE CASE OF Q VILLAGE, WE DESCRIBE HOW HIERARCHICAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT SITS UNEASILY WITH VILLAGE DELIBERATION THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. WHEN OFFICIALS ATTEMPT TO CURTAIL THE LEGALLY MANDATED VILLAGE DELIBERATION PROCESS, THEY ENCOUNTER STIFF RESISTANCE AND EVEN A PARTICIPATION STRIKE.
219	ACCORDING TO MARXISM, FAIRNESS OR EQUITY IS CONCRETE, EVOLVING, AND PRACTICE-BASED, AND HAS AS ITS ULTIMATE AIM THE REALIZATION OF THE FULL AND FREE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN. XI JINPING THOUGHT ON FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE UNDERSCORES GOVERNING THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW, IMPROVING WORK STYLES, INNOVATING THE SOCIAL GOVERNANCE MODEL, AND MAKING SOCIAL WELFARE AND PEOPLE'S FULL AND FREE DEVELOPMENT THE POINT OF DEPARTURE AND ULTIMATE GOAL, IN A FRESH DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARXIST APPROACH TO EQUITY IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA. GUIDED BY THIS APPROACH, CHINESE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BREAK FREE OF THE TRADITIONAL REGIMEN, SHIFTING THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FROM BUREAUCRATIC MANAGEMENT TO SHARED GOVERNANCE AND FROM THE TRADITIONAL RULE OF MAN TO THE RULE OF LAW. THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES AND OBSERVANCE OF THE BASIC LAWS OF HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT, WE CAN BUILD A NEW TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP AMONG GOVERNMENTS, INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING, ACADEMICS AND STUDENTS, AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. IN THIS WAY, ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL FIND THEIR PROPER PLACE AND REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, THUS ACTIVATING AND ENHANCING THE INNOVATIVE CAPACITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION. ONLY THUS WILL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS BE ABLE TO MODERNIZE THEIR GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS AND CAPACITY.
220	PURPOSE - CRIMES AND CONFLICTS ARE SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE BEST GOVERNANCE TOOLS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE SCOURGES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS ASSESS A SAMPLE OF 38 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OWING TO THE CROSS-SECTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE DATA SET, THE AUTHORS ADOPT A HETEROSCEDASTICITY CONSISTENT ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE. FOR FURTHER ROBUSTNESS PURPOSES, THE AUTHORS EMPLOY RAMSEY'S REGRESSION EQUATION SPECIFICATION ERROR TEST. FINDINGS - THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, DEMOCRACY, AUTOCRACY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS WITH CRIME. SECOND, THE INCREASING RELEVANCE OF GOVERNMENT QUALITY IN THE FIGHT IS AS FOLLOWS: REGULATION QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL. THIRD, CORRUPTION-CONTROL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MECHANISM IN FIGHTING CRIME (CONFLICTS). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONG WHEN CONTROLLING FOR AGE DEPENDENCY, NUMBER OF POLICE (AND SECURITY) OFFICERS, PER CAPITA ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND POPULATION DENSITY. JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE EDGE OF CORRUPTION-CONTROL (AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE TOOL) AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY IS TIMELY GIVEN THE POLITICAL INSTABILITY, WARS AND CONFLICTS CURRENTLY MARRING AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT.
221	AFTER THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF KOREA RULED IN JUNE 2007 THAT IT WAS "INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTITUTION TO LIMIT VOTING RIGHTS TO CITIZENS ON THE CONDITION OF RESIDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS IN KOREA," VOTING RIGHTS WERE GRANTED TO OVERSEAS KOREAN NATIONALS FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS TO RELATED REGULATIONS UNDER THE PUBLIC OFFICIAL ELECTION ACT IN 2009. ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULING IN 2007, OVERSEAS KOREANS MUST BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S DECISION OF 2007 BY FOCUSING ON A THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THEORY. WITH REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, OVERSEAS KOREANS MAY BE CONSTITUTIONALLY DEPRIVED OF OR DENIED THEIR VOTING RIGHTS IF THE RANGE OF DEMOS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE LIMITATION OF SUFFRAGE IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO A STRICT CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW, BUT A LESS STRINGENT PROCESS MAY BE INVOLVED IN VOTING RESTRICTIONS OF OVERSEAS KOREANS BECAUSE RESTRICTIONS ARE GENERALLY REFLECTED IN THE POLITICAL VALUES BETWEEN COUNTRIES.
222	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON A CRUCIAL AND INSUFFICIENTLY EXAMINED ISSUE OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY, SEEN AS A KEY ELEMENT IN SECURING CONTINUITY AND PROVIDING THE INTELLECTUAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE FRANCOIST REGIME. WITHOUT ANALYZING THE TENSION BETWEEN LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND AND SUCCESSFULLY DISMANTLE THE THESIS OF THE REGIME'S INTELLECTUALS, RECENTLY REVITALIZED BY REVISIONIST HISTORIANS, ACCORDING TO WHICH FRANCOISM SUCCEEDED IN RE-ESTABLISHING HISTORICAL CONTINUITY AND POLITICAL NORMALCY IN SPANISH SOCIETY. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COLD WAR, IT WAS CRUCIAL FOR SPANISH LEGAL SCHOLARS TO PORTRAY FRANCOISM NOT AS A BASTION OF ANTI-LIBERALISM, BUT AS A REGIME WHOSE SURVIVAL ENTAILED AN ORIGINAL INTERPRETATION OF NOTIONS SUCH AS FREEDOM, RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY AND AUTHORITY. THEY ARGUED THAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FRANCOISM CONSISTED NOT ONLY IN DEFEATING LIBERALISM IN SPAIN BUT IN OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF ITS MAIN TENETS. BY ASPIRING TO JUSTIFY AND OVERCOME ITS OWN HISTORICAL EXCEPTIONALITY, THE FRANCOIST REGIME SOUGHT TO AVOID THE INEVITABILITY OF ITS DEMISE. BY VIRTUE OF ITS FAILURE TO DO SO, FRANCOISM REMAINED OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL NORM, TO WHICH ONLY DEMOCRATIC SPAIN WOULD BE RE-ADMITTED.
223	TRUST FUNCTIONS AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ESTABLISHING LONG-TERM AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS. IN THIS PAPER WE INVESTIGATE THE SOURCES OF GENERALIZED TRUST. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH IS THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN ALLOWING TRUST-BASED RELATIONSHIPS TO FORM, CONTROLLING FOR THE ATTRIBUTES AND MOTIVES OF INDIVIDUAL AGENTS. THE CENTRAL CONTENTION OF THE PAPER IS THAT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT NORMS OF FAIRNESS, UNIVERSALITY, AND THE DIVISION OF POWER CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMATION OF INTER-PERSONAL TRUST. USING DATA FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY WE RUN MULTI-LEVEL MODELS TO TEST FOR LINKS BETWEEN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUALS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND THE TRUST-SUPPORTING CONTEXT, IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS. ALONGSIDE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES AND ATTITUDES, ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, WE TEST FOR SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF CONTEXTUAL FACTORS - SUCH AS THE INFLUENCE OF FORMAL RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS, SOCIAL INEQUALITY, AND THE DIVISION OF POWER OR PLURALISTIC DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES. THE STUDY COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT UNIVERSALISTIC, IMPARTIAL AND POWER-SHARING INSTITUTIONS INCREASE THE PROSPECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENERALIZED TRUST.
224	THE RULING OF THE SPANISH SUPREME COURT IN JUDGMENT NO. 1263/2018, RECOGNIZING, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE BINDING CHARACTER OF THE VIEWS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW COMMITTEE), AUGMENTED THE NORMATIVE AUTHORITY OF THE VIEWS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY MONITORING BODY, NOT ONLY AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL, BUT ALSO WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SPHERE. IN THE JUDGMENT, THE SPANISH HIGHEST COURT HELD THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST COMPLY WITH THE VIEWS OF THE CEDAW COMMITTEE AS A MATTER OF THE STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE AS WELL AS ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION IN THIS CASE MEETS THE EXPECTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY MONITORING BODIES THAT STATES ARE OBLIGATED TO RESPOND TO THEIR VIEWS CONCERNING INDIVIDUAL COMMUNICATIONS, DESPITE SOME STATES PARTIES' CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY.
225	THE URBANIZATION OF CHINA IS CHANGING FROM INCREMENTAL GROWTH TO URBAN INTENSIFICATION, AND URBAN COMPACTNESS IS A SIGNIFICANT ATTRIBUTE FOR MEASURING THE INTENSIFIED DEGREE OF REGIONAL SPACE AND SOCIETAL FRAMEWORKS. WE CAREFULLY OUTLINE THE INADEQUACIES OF COMPACTNESS MEASURING METHODOLOGIES AND ASSOCIATED RESEARCH, AND ARGUE THAT COMPACT CITIES AND METRO SYSTEMS CONTRIBUTE TO URBAN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN TANDEM. THEREBY, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATED 27 STRATEGIC REGION OF METRO STATIONS ON CHENGDU METRO LINE 1 AND PROPOSED A NOVEL URBAN COMPACTNESS MODEL IN THREE-DIMENSIONS. THE RESULT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE OLD URBAN AREA BEFORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METRO SYSTEM AND THE NEW TOWN THEREAFTER HAVE EXTREME COMPACTNESS OUTCOMES, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CONTRASTS IN MORPHOLOGY AND INTENSIFICATION INDICES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CORRELATION AND INTERACTION PROCESSES AMONG COMPACTNESS, MORPHOLOGY, AND INTENSIVE MULTIPLE VARIABLES IN ORDER TO GIVE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SUPPORT FOR THE INTENSIFICATION DESIGN OF THESE TWO REGIONS IN CHENGDU.
226	THE OPTIMUM ECONOMIC OUTCOME OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS ON ITS LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FINANCIAL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY. FOR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS, WE HAVE USED A PANEL DATASET OF 108 COUNTRIES FROM 1996-2020 AND EMPLOYED FIXED EFFECT REGRESSION AND TWO STAGES LEAST SQUARES (2SLS) REGRESSION METHODS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON FINANCIAL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY. PARTICULARLY ALL THE CONSTITUTING ELEMENTS-VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION-OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ARE FOUND TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON FINANCIAL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW-INCOME LEVELS AND STRONG INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THESE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST ACROSS SEVERAL ROBUSTNESS TESTS CONDUCTED USING ADDITIONAL CONTROLS, ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES, AN ALTERNATIVE MEASURE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SUGGEST THAT POLICY MAKERS SHOULD PRIORITIZE BOTH ENHANCING AND SUSTAINING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TO PROMOTE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
227	THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INTERVIEW (EPI) ON AIR POLLUTION IS SELF-EVIDENT. HOWEVER, THE SUSTAINED EFFECT OF EPI IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL IN CURRENT STUDIES. MEANWHILE, THE MECHANISM OF THE EFFECT OF EPI ON AIR POLLUTION AND THE POLICY EFFICIENCY HAVE ALSO NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED. TO NARROW THE RESEARCH GAP, THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE RELEVANT ISSUES USING THE TIME-VARYING DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES (DID) METHOD BASED ON PANEL DATA OF 287 PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITIES IN CHINA FROM 2010 TO 2020. IT IS FOUND THAT EPI REDUCES PM2.5 BY 3.709 MU G/M3 ON AVERAGE, AND THE CURBING EFFECT EXISTS FOR 5 YEARS AFTER THE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. MECHANISM ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT EPI REDUCES AIR POLLUTION BY RAISING THE ATTENTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, PROMOTING INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE UPGRADING, MOBILIZING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, AND SYNERGISTIC MANAGEMENT OF THE THREEFOLD APPROACH. HETEROGENEITY ANALYSIS FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THE REDUCTION EFFECT OF EPI IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN REGIONS WITH DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, POOR RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS, AND LOW LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW. THE FINAL ANALYSIS OF POLICY EFFICIENCY INDICATES THAT THE HEALTH BENEFITS GENERATED BY EPI ARE 2.82 TIMES GREATER THAN THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF ITS APPLICATION.
228	THE CURRENT STUDY ESTIMATES THRESHOLD LEVELS OF THE PUBLIC DEBT-TO-GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) RATIO AND THE BUDGET DEFICIT FOR 106 DEVELOPING AND 36 DEVELOPED COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2018. A PCA-BASED FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY INDICATOR IS ALSO CONSTRUCTED AND A DYNAMIC PANEL THRESHOLD REGRESSION IS EMPLOYED. THE MAIN FINDINGS REVEAL A THRESHOLD EFFECT IN THE PUBLIC DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO AND BUDGET DEFICIT -FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY NEXUS. THE PUBLIC DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO AND BUDGET DEFICIT ARE BENEFICIAL IN MAINTAINING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AT LOWER OR UPPER THRESHOLD LEVELS IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS. THE HIGHEST THRESHOLD LEVEL OF THE PUBLIC DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO WAS 59.56% FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND 64.87% FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE HIGHEST THRESHOLD LEVEL OF BUDGET DEFICIT-TO-GDP RATIO WAS 0.41% FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND 3.34% FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THREE INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE THRESHOLD ESTIMATION: REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. POLICYMAKERS ARE ADVISED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN THRESHOLD POINTS TO ENSURE A FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE LEVEL. THE QUALITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION SHOULD ALSO BE IMPROVED.
229	WITH THE EXPANSION OF INTERNET USE AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, CYBERCRIMINALS CAN NOW EASILY VIOLATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. BECAUSE OF THIS, CYBERCRIME-RELATED ISSUES ARE SWIFTLY SPREADING THROUGHOUT INDONESIA. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS ARTICLES, POLICIES, AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TO COMBAT CYBERCRIME, MUCH WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE THE FUNCTION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN COMBATING CYBERCRIME IN INDONESIA BY ANALYZING THE APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. A QUALITATIVE NORMATIVE LEGAL APPROACH WAS UTILIZED IN THE RESEARCH TO ACHIEVE THE STUDY'S OBJECTIVE. DATA WAS GATHERED FROM PRIMARY (LEGAL DOCUMENTS, LEGISLATIONS, LAWS, CASE LAWS, ETC.) AND SECONDARY (PUBLICATIONS, ARTICLES) SOURCES. ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS, INDONESIA HAS EXTENSIVE POLICIES, ARTICLES, AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TO INSPECT AND CONTROL CYBER SECURITY BREACHES AND COMBAT CYBERCRIME. HOWEVER, THE FORMULATED LAWS REGARDING CYBERSECURITY AND COMBATING CYBERCRIME ARE POORLY IMPLEMENTED. THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT IS OBLIGATED TO ANTICIPATE CYBER THREATS BY ADEQUATELY FORMULATING CYBER-SECURITY POLICIES AND IDENTIFYING COMPREHENSIVE STEPS FOR DEFENDING AGAINST CYBER-ATTACKS, THEIR SCALE, AND TYPES OF COUNTERMEASURES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW NECESSARY TO EXERT PROPER CONTROL OVER CYBER-ATTACKS IN INDONESIA.
230	ECO-ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE A COMPLEX PROBLEM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA, AMONG WHICH RIVER WATER POLLUTION CONTROL IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ISSUES. IN THE CONTINUOUS PURSUIT OF RIVER POLLUTION CONTROL, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED THE RIVER CHIEF SYSTEM (RCS) MODEL TO APPOINT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS RIVER CHIEFS OF EACH SECTION. THIS REVIEW FIRST ANALYZES THE WATER QUALITY DATA OF THE HUAIHE RIVER BASIN OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS USING ORIGIN 2021. A VIOLIN PLOT SHOWS THAT THE WATER QUALITY OF THE HUAIHE RIVER BASIN IMPROVED, AND CODMN AND NH3-N WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. SECONDLY, THIS REVIEW ANALYZES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RIVER CHIEF SYSTEM ACCORDING TO THE "EMBEDDEDNESS THEORY", WHICH ARGUES THAT THE RIVER CHIEF SYSTEM HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE TRADITIONAL HIERARCHY OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE IN CHINA THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL EMBEDDEDNESS TO ACTIVATE THE VITALITY OF THE SUBJECT'S CONTROL AND SPATIAL EMBEDDEDNESS TO ELIMINATE FRAGMENTED WATERSHED GOVERNANCE AND PROMOTE GOVERNANCE CAPACITY. PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS AND INITIATIVES WERE PROPOSED BASED ON THE EXISTING RCS, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION, REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE MANAGEMENT, AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION TO RESTORE THE LOCAL ECOLOGY.
231	THIS ARTICLE TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE UNITED NATIONS' COMMITMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF ITS POSITION ON OCCUPIED PALESTINE POST 1967. OCCUPATION OF ENEMY TERRITORY IS MEANT TO BE TEMPORARY, AND THE OCCUPYING POWER MAY NOT RIGHTFULLY CLAIM SOVEREIGNTY OVER SUCH TERRITORY. SINCE 1967, ISRAEL HAS SYSTEMATICALLY AND FORCIBLY ALTERED THE STATUS OF OCCUPIED PALESTINE, WITH THE AIM OF ANNEXING, DE JURE OR DE FACTO, MOST OR ALL OF IT. WHILE THE UN HAS FOCUSED ON THE LEGALITY OF ISRAEL'S DISCRETE VIOLATIONS OF HUMANITARIAN AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, IT HAS PAID SCANT ATTENTION TO THE LEGALITY OF ISRAEL'S OCCUPATION REGIME AS A WHOLE. BY WHAT RATIONALE CAN IT BE SAID THAT ISRAEL'S PROLONGED OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE REMAINS LEGAL? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE OCCUPATION HAS BECOME ILLEGAL FOR ITS SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION OF AT LEAST THREE JUS COGENS NORMS. ALTHOUGH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMMENTATORS HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THIS VIEW, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO ITS RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL CONSEQUENCES WHICH DICTATE A PARADIGM SHIFT AWAY FROM NEGOTIATIONS AS THE CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR ENDING THE OCCUPATION, AS UNANIMOUSLY AFFIRMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THROUGH THE UN.
232	THE ROLE OF CUSTOMARY LAWS IN THE NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS OF SOUTH ASIA IS IMPORTANT, BUT AMBIVALENT, AS SCHOLARS, COLONIAL POWERS AND MORE RECENTLY LAWYERS AND STATE BUREAUCRATS, HAVE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH FULLY GRASPING THE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ROLES OF CUSTOMARY LAWS IN SOUTH ASIA. EXAMINING STATE REGULATION PATTERNS, ONE FINDS THAT FIRST COLONIAL AND THEN THE MOSTLY POSTCOLONIAL STATES IN THE REGION (WITH SOME DIFFERENCES IN NEPAL AND BHUTAN, IN PARTICULAR) HAVE OFTEN NOT OPENLY ENOUGH ADMITTED THE IMPORTANT PLACE OR ROLES OF CUSTOMARY LAWS THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND UNTIL NOW. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES IN DEPTH SEVERAL CONCEPTUAL AND HISTORICAL REASONS FOR THIS NOTABLE RELUCTANCE AND THEN FOCUSES, AFTER A BRIEF EXCURSION INTO COLONIAL INTERVENTIONS, ON POST-1947 INDIA. THE MAIN AIM IS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE HUGE UNIQUE MULTICULTURAL STATE OF INDIA HANDLES THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES OF MAINTAINING NATIONAL UNITY AS WELL AS A CULTURE-SPECIFIC FORM OF 'RULE OF LAW'. INDIA ACHIEVES THIS PARTLY BY RELYING ON VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF CUSTOMARY LAWS, WHICH CONTINUE TO SHAPE HOW THIS INTERCULTURAL STATE/NATION HANDLES THE ENORMOUS CHALLENGES OF RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE THAT ARISE IN VARIOUS DOMAINS, INCLUDING NOW PROMINENTLY PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT.
233	THIS YEAR, THE LEGAL COMMUNITY CELEBRATES THE ANNIVERSARY OF TALIYA YARULLOVNA KHABRIEVA, A PROMINENT RUSSIAN SCHOLAR, A LEGAL EXPERT AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF LEGISLATION AND COMPARATIVE LAW UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, ACADEMICIAN OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW (VENICE COMMISSION OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE). SHE IS THE TYPE OF PERSON, AMONG OTHERS IN CONSTELLATION SHE BELONGS TO, WHO CONQUERS THE DEPTHS OF SCIENCE AND THE SUMMITS OF RECOGNITION. THE ARTICLE CONTAINS A SCIENTIFIC BIOGRAPHY OF T. Y. KHABRIEVA, DESCRIBES HER SCIENTIFIC EFFORTS, AND PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF HER CONTRIBUTION TO THE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN, FOREIGN AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCIENCE. THE ROLE OF ACADEMICIAN T. Y. KHABRIEVA IS SHOWN IN THE LAW-MAKING PROCESS, ADDRESSING PRACTICAL LEGAL ISSUES OF RULEMAKING, AND IMPROVING RUSSIAN LEGISLATION IN ITS DIFFERENT BRANCHES. THE ARTICLE ALSO FOCUSES ON THE SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL WORK OF TALIYA YARULLOVNA ON STRENGTHENING THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES, FORMATION OF THE RULE-OF- LAW STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY, DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATION OF ACADEMIC STAFF.
234	TURKISH CONSTITUTIONS HAVE GENERALLY SOUGHT TO LIMIT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S EMERGENCY POWERS BY CODIFYING AND SUBJECTING THEM TO JUDICIAL AND PARLIAMENTARY SUPERVISION. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, EVER SINCE THE SINGLE-PARTY REGIME OF THE INTERWAR YEARS, CABINETS HAVE WIELDED WIDE POWERS TO SUSPEND RIGHTS AND EXERCISE DISCRETION CONCERNING BOTH SECURITY ISSUES AND PROPERTY AND FINANCE REGIMES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT, BARRED FROM EXPLICITLY EMBRACING EXECUTIVE PREROGATIVE AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, HAS INSTEAD DISPERSED "EXCEPTIONAL" POWERS THROUGHOUT THE FABRIC OF THE STATUTES, TEMPORARY LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND DECREES WITH WHICH THE STATE ARTICULATES ITS AUTHORITY. THE TASK OF MAINTAINING A SEMBLANCE OF NORMALITY AND COHERENCE WITHIN THIS SCATTERED AND CONTRADICTORY SYSTEM HAS BEEN LEFT TO LEGAL THEORETICIANS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THREE SUCH THEORETICIANS-THE LAW PROFESSORS SIDDIK SAMI ONAR, ALI FUAD BASGIL, AND RAGIP SARICA-RESPONDED TO THE CABINET'S RECOURSE TO EMERGENCY POWERS DURING THE TROUBLED 1930S AND 1940S. INSTEAD OF DEFENDING RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES, I ARGUE, THESE FORMATIVE FIGURES INTEGRATED PREROGATIVE INTO THE SPHERE OF ORDINARY LEGALITY, THEREBY TRANSFORMING EXCEPTIONAL POWERS INTO A NORMAL MODE OF GOVERNANCE.
235	THE ESSAY FOCUSES KANT'S ENGAGEMENT WITH PLATO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC OF THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, WHICH PRESENTS A CRUCIAL BUT OFTEN OVERLOOKED FEATURE OF KANT'S MAGNUM OPUS. IN PARTICULAR, THE ESSAY EXAMINES KANT'S POSITIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE "PLATONIC REPUBLIC" (PLATONISCHE REPUBLIK) IN BOOK ONE OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC BY PLACING THEM IN THE TWOFOLD CONTEXT OF THE FIRST CRITIQUE'S AFFIRMATIVE RETAKE ON PLATO'S FORMS (IDEEN) AND ITS ORIGINAL VIEWS ON JURIDICO-POLITICAL MATTERS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ESSAY AIMS TO SHOW THAT KANT'S PRIME POSITION IN LEGAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, AS CONTAINED IN THE FIRST EDITION OF THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781), INVOLVES A NORMATIVE CONCEPTION OF CIVIC LIFE THAT PLACES THE SOCIETAL EXERCISE OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM UNDER UNIVERSAL LAWS. SECTION 1 EXPLORES THE EXTENT OF AFFINITY BETWEEN PLATO AND KANT AS ARCH-REPRESENTATIVES OF ANCIENT AND MODERN IDEALISM. SECTION 2 TRACES THE TRANSITION FROM PLATONIC DOGMATISM TO KANTIAN CRITICISM IN THE THEORY OF IDEAS. SECTION 3 PRESENTS KANT'S APPROPRIATION OF THE IDEA OF THE "PLATONIC REPUBLIC" FOR PURPOSES OF A SPECIFICALLY MODERN REPUBLICAN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER CONDITIONS OF FREEDOM.
236	TAKING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IN PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE AND SPAIN, (COMMONLY REFERRED TO WITH THE DEROGATORY ACRONYM PIGS), AS BACKDROP TO THIS ANALYSIS, THE ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IN EUROPE (FOCUSING ON GREECE AND PORTUGAL IN PARTICULAR) HAS NOT ADDRESSED THE STATE OF ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. THIS GAP IN INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, TOGETHER WITH THE UNPOPULARITY OF EMERGENCY AUSTERITY MEASURES, RAISES SERIOUS DOUBTS CONCERNING THEIR LEGITIMACY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES TWO THEORETICAL RESPONSES TO THIS GREY AREA OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGALITY: THE FIRST ONE CONSTRUES SOCIAL UNREST IN GREECE AGAINST AUSTERITY MEASURES AS A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO RESISTANCE, ENTRENCHED IN ART 120 OF THE GREEK CONSTITUTION. THE SECOND RESPONSE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF AUSTERITY MEASURES BY THE PORTUGUESE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, WHICH IS PRESENTED AS A ROBUST EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW WITH REGARDS TO EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MEASURES OSCILLATES BETWEEN STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEFERENCE TO LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IN A TIME OF ECONOMIC CRISIS, THUS RAISING SERIOUS DOUBTS AS TO ITS EFFICIENCY AND PERSUASIVENESS. STATES OF ECONOMIC EMERGENCY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS AN URGENT MATTER OF INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN.
237	EVEN THOUGH FOR 40 YEARS IT HAS BEEN A FAIR TRIAL REQUIREMENT THAT PERSONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, A CLARIFICATION OF WHAT DEFENCE COUNSEL'S ROLE IS, OR SHOULD BE, STILL SEEMS TO BE REQUIRED. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE PROPER ROLE OF DEFENCE COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, IN PARTICULAR. IT IS CONTENDED THAT A CLARIFICATION OF THIS ROLE IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIALS. WHERE LAWYERS (DEFENCE COUNSEL, PROSECUTION COUNSEL AND JUDGES) FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD WORK TOGETHER IN ONE LEGAL SYSTEM, THEY WILL INEVITABLY BRING IN A VARIETY OF ASSUMPTIONS ON THE PARAMETERS OF THE ROLE OF DEFENCE COUNSEL. CLARIFICATION WILL PREVENT CONFUSION AND HOPEFULLY RESULT IN MUTUAL RESPECT FOR EACH PARTICIPANT'S ROLE AND THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE UPHOLDING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. YET CLARIFICATION OF THIS ROLE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO GUARANTEE AN EFFECTIVE DEFENCE. FOR AN EFFECTIVE DISCHARGE OF COUNSEL'S FUNCTIONS, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURTS SHOULD ALSO GUARANTEE THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN BASIC FACILITIES TO THE DEFENCE.
238	FROM THE PASSAGE OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT OF 1887 THROUGH THE NEW DEAL, AMERICAN LEGISLATORS COMMONLY ENDOWED ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES WITH BROAD DISCRETIONARY POWER. THEY DID SO OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF AN INTELLECTUAL FOUNDER OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THE AMERICAN-BORN, GERMAN-EDUCATED LAWYER AND POLITICAL SCIENTIST ERNST FREUND DEVELOPED AN AMERICANIZED VERSION OF THE RECHTSSTAAT-A GOVERNMENT BOUND BY FIXED AND DEFINITE RULES-IN AN IMPRESSIVE BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP BETWEEN 1894 AND 1915. IN. 1920 HE EAGERLY TOOK UP AN OFFER FROM THE COMMENWEALTH FUND TO FINANCE A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF ADMINISTRATION IN THE UNITED STATES. HERE WAS HIS CHANCE TO SHOW THAT A CONTINENTAL VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAD COME TO AMERICA. UNFORTUNATELY FOR FREUND, THE COMMONWEALTH FUND. YOKED HIM TO THE AUSTRIAN-BORN, AMERICAN-EDUCATED FELIX FRANKFURTER, A CELEBRANT OF THE ENLIGHTENED. DISCRETION OF ADMINISTRATORS. FREUND'S MAJOR PUBLICATION FOR THE COMMONWEALTH FUND, ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OVER PERSONS AND PROPERTY (1928), MADE LITTLE IMPRESSION ON SCHOLARS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WHO TOOK THEIR LEAD FROM FRANKFURTER TODAY THE RECHTSSTAAT IS LARGELY THE BEAU IDEAL OF LIBERTARIAN, CRITICS OF THE NEW DEAL, FEW RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS ALSO PART OF THE DIVERSE LEGACY OF PROGRESSIVE REFORM.
239	THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM CONTRIBUTES TO THE PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN. A CHILD'S EARLY YEARS LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR PERSONAL AND SOCIAL GROWTH TOWARDS THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC AND RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE GENERAL LACK OF SATISFACTION IN AND TRUST OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS, THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS QUESTIONS WHETHER THIS DISAFFECTION COULD BE RELATED TO THE WAY IN WHICH THESE VALUES ARE REFLECTED IN OFFICIAL TEACHING. MULTIPLE STUDIES AFFIRM THAT DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES ARE SCARCE AND INSUFFICIENT IN THE EARLY YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION, IN MULTIPLE CONTEXTS AND COUNTRIES. THIS ARTICLE STUDIES OFFICIAL DATA ON LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY SINCE 2000, AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN ENSHRINED IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION IN SPAIN AND MEXICO. IT SHOWS THAT DEMOCRATIC CULTURE AND CIVIC LITERACY PLAY A PART FROM THE VERY FIRST YEARS OF SCHOOLING. UNLIKE THIS INITIAL EDUCATION, IN LATER STAGES THERE IS A GREATER PRESENCE OF DEMOCRATIC ASPECTS LINKED TO THE ACTIVE EXERCISE OF CITIZENSHIP, ESPECIALLY IN SPAIN. THIS STUDY APPEALS FOR GREATER EFFORTS FROM EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITIES TO PROMOTE THESE DEMOCRATIC VALUES FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD AND THUS GUARANTEE GREATER SATISFACTION AND TRUST IN THE RULE OF LAW.
240	BASED ON THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS PROMULGATED IN CHINESE PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITIES FROM 2000 TO 2018, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION ON GREEN TOTAL FACTOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY (GTFEE). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IMPLEMENTING ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES LOCAL GTFEE, WITH COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION REGULATIONS CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS, WHILE THE IMPACT OF POLLUTION PREVENTION REGULATIONS IS INSIGNIFICANT. THIS CONCLUSION REMAINS ROBUST TO MULTIPLE SCENARIOS. POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION CAN GUIDE URBAN GREEN TRANSITION INCLUDE THE INDUSTRIAL UPGRADING EFFECT REPRESENTED BY "CLEAN INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT" AND "POLLUTING INDUSTRY EXIT", AS WELL AS THE TECHNICAL INNOVATION EFFECT ACHIEVED THROUGH "NEW TECHNOLOGY GENERATION" AND "OLD TECHNOLOGY UPGRADING". FURTHERMORE, ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF REGULATORY EFFECTIVENESS HAS A GREATER POTENTIAL FOR ENERGY SAVING. ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION HAS A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON IMPROVING GTFEE IN CITIES IN NON-OLD INDUSTRIAL BASES, WITH LESS FREQUENT TURNOVER OF OFFICIALS, AND IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGIONS IN CHINA. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION ON GTFEE, AIMING TO ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION GOVERNANCE AND THEREBY PROMOTE URBAN GREEN TRANSITION.
241	THIS ARTICLE ENGAGES ONGOING POLICY DEBATES CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCENTRATED ECONOMIC POWER, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW, FOCUSING ON COMPETITION POLICY - KNOWN IN THE UNITED STATES AS ANTI-TRUST LAW. I ANALYZE HOW NEO-BRANDEISIAN JURISTS AND ADVOCATES (WHO ARE NAMED AFTER THE LATE, PROGRESSIVE-ERA U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, LOUIS BRANDEIS), HAVE RAISED CRITICAL CONCERNS IN THEIR CRITIQUES OF HOW CHICAGO SCHOOL JURISTS HAVE CONCEIVED OF AND DEPLOYED THE CONCEPT OF "CONSUMER WELFARE." AS I ARGUE, THE CRUX OF THE NEO-BRANDEISIAN INTERVENTION CONCERNS THE NEED TO REEVALUATE THE APPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND MARKETS. YET, AS I ALSO EXPLORE, NEO-BRANDEISIANS ERR IN THEIR DEPICTION OF MARKET DYNAMICS AND THE PLACE OF LABOR WITHIN THEM. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, I INCORPORATE INSIGHTS FROM MARXIST LEGAL STUDIES AND POLITICAL ECONOMY. I PRESENT MY ARGUMENT IN THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF COMPETITION POLICY, HIGHLIGHTING HOW ONE OF ITS PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS HAS BEEN A CONCERN WITH CHALLENGING CONCENTRATED ECONOMIC POWER. MY DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS HOW A REVISED STANDARD FOR COMPETITION POLICY, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO PROMOTING DEMOCRACY, IS POSSIBLE FROM SYNTHESIZING INSIGHTS FROM NEO-BRANDEISIANS WITH MARXISTS.
242	SINCE THE 2015 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN POLAND, THE GOVERNMENT LED BY THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY (PIS) HAS SOUGHT TO WIN TWO INTERWOVEN BATTLES: THE RESTORATION OF 'A STRONG STATE' INTERNALLY AND 'REGAINING SOVEREIGNTY' IN THE COUNTRY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU. BY EXAMINING THE 2015 CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN POLAND, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY A DOMESTIC DISPUTE OVER THE NOMINATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES HAS TRANSFORMED INTO A CONFLICT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE EU POLITY. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT THE CLAIMS TO SOVEREIGNTY OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND LEGAL ACTORS REFLECT OPPOSING CONCEPTIONS OF THIS PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. PIS' UNDERSTANDING OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY IS ROOTED IN THE PAST, ECHOES ITS HOBBESIAN CONCEPTION, AND IS REMINISCENT OF CARL SCHMITT'S NOTION OF THE POLITICAL AND OF DEMOCRACY. IN 2015, THIS CONCEPTION WAS PITTED AGAINST THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION (LEGAL SOVEREIGNTY) AND THE IDEAL OF SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. DRAWING ON 20 PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THE 2015 POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS ENCAPSULATES A CONFLICT OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER WHO HOLDS THE MOST LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE AND WHO SHOULD HAVE THE LAST WORD IN KEY POLITICAL CONFLICTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENTS.
243	THIS PAPER SCRUTINISES THE APPLICABILITY OF ANTI-DOPING LEGAL REGIME AS ADJUDICATED IN THE COURT OF ARBITRATION FOR SPORT (CAS). IT ARGUES THAT THE EXISTING PROVISIONS DEALING WITH 'NON-ANALYTICAL POSITIVE DOPING' IN THE WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY (WADA) CODE ARE ARBITRARY AND VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE. WHILE DETERMINING 'NON-ANALYTICAL POSITIVE DOPING VIOLATION', THE ANTI-DOPING ORGANISATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVE THE ATHLETE'S GUILT BECAUSE, UNDER THE EXISTING WADA CODE, THIS GUILT IS PRESUMED REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF VIOLATION. THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF RULE OF LAW MEANT FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO EXAMINE WHETHER FAIR TRIAL GUARANTEES ARE AVAILABLE TO THE ATHLETES WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT FOR TRIAL BEFORE THE CAS AND NATIONAL ANTI-DOPING ORGANISATIONS. IN SUCH CASES, CAS PANEL HAS EVOLVED A PRESUMPTION IN FAVOUR OF WADA. THE WADA PROVISIONS RESULT IN A VIOLATION OF THE ATHLETE'S RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. THE STUDY REVEALS THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL DEFECTS OF CAS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THE WADA CODE AND ISSUES RELATED TO THE VIOLATION OF RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL.
244	IT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED THAT THE KEYSTONE OF SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE IS ITS EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH ITS PRIORITY DWELLING UPON PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, IS THIS FORMULA OPERATIONAL IN THE CASE OF CHINA WITH ITS AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL REGIME FOR WHICH THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW IS THE WILL OF THE PARTY LEADER? THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF CHINA HAS BEEN PROGRESSING OVER THE PAST SEVENTY YEARS AND HOW THESE PROCESSES CORRELATE WITH THE REFORMS IN THE ECONOMY. PROFOUND CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONS BETWEEN MENTAL REFERENCE POINTS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE AND THE "FRAGILITY" OF THE INSTITUTION OF LAW IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN REVEALED. THE PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN RELATION TO THE INDICATORS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE COUNTRY IN COMPARISON WITH SIMILAR INDICATORS OF NINE MOST SUCCESSFUL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. IT IS PROVEN THAT THE FORMAL LAW IN CHINA SERVES AS A MERE INSTRUMENT FOR A FARSIGHTED, AUTHORITARIAN AND RIGIDLY HIERARCHICAL POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH USES ECONOMIC LEVERS WITH THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING AMBITIOUS GOALS OF CONQUERING THE ENTIRE WORLD.
245	BASED ON THE ANALYTICAL AND SYNTHESIS STUDY OF A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLISHED DOCUMENTARY SOURCES, THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE AUTHORS' APPROACH TO THE ISSUE OF SELF-RESTRICTION OF STATE POWER. GENERAL THEORETICAL ASPECTS, HISTORICAL AND ORIENTED TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PROBLEM WERE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE SELF-LIMITATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE IN THEORY AND IN CONCRETE REALITY. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT IS A STUDY THAT USES IN EQUAL CONDITIONS THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT EMERGE FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, WITH THE HERMENEUTIC READING OF THE LEGAL DOCTRINE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE MATTER. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, IN THE CONSIDERED CONTEXT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE PROBLEM OF THE CONSTANT AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF STATE POWER OFTEN SEEMS TO MANIFEST ITSELF SATISFACTORILY. THEORETICALLY, AT FIRST SIGHT, ONCE REGULATED, THE CORRESPONDING SYSTEM A PRIORI ACQUIRES A CONSTANT AND STABLE CHARACTER, HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO TO ACHIEVE THE FOUNDATION OF A SUSTAINED DYNAMIC OF SELF-LIMITATION AND SELF-REGULATION OF STATE POWER IN IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
246	THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOURCES OF THE MODERN PROHIBITION OF TORTURE BY TRACING DIFFERENT SYSTEMATIC STEPS IN THE DIFFICULT MORAL STRUGGLE AGAINST TORTURE. IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT THE RELUCTANCE TO EMBRACE AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON TORTURE DOES NOT ORIGINATE ONLY FROM ANCIENT CONVICTIONS BUT ALSO FROM THE INTERNAL TENSIONS BETWEEN SOVEREIGNTY AND FREEDOM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGITIMATION OF THE MODERN STATE. STARTING WITH THE UNIVERSALLY EMPATHIC APPROACH OF 16TH CENTURY'S HUMANISTS THE MORAL CONDEMNATION OF TORTURE SHIFTED ITS FOCUS SUCCESSIVELY FROM MATTERS SUCH AS PITY OR THE PROTECTION OF BODILY INTEGRITY TO THE RECOGNITION OF HUMAN SELF-DETERMINATION. DURING THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT, THE AMBIGUITY OF THE MODERN CONCEPT OF THE STATE IS EVEN MORE CLEARLY REVEALED. POLITICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST TORTURE ARE PUT FORWARD BY UTILITARIANS ONLY STRESSING, AGAIN, THE FUTILITY OF BODILY PAIN. KANT AND HEGEL, HOWEVER, THOUGH DEVELOPING HUMAN DIGNITY AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE STICK TO RETRIBUTION AND THE STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEIR APPROACH OVEREMPHASIZES CERTAIN NOTIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND LEADS TO PERPLEXING CONSEQUENCES. THIS CAN BE SHOWN ALSO WITH REGARD TO THE ACTUAL DEBATE CONCERNING EXCEPTIONS FROM THE GENERAL PROHIBITION OF TORTURE.
247	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES A MUCH-NEGLECTED ASPECT OF NEIL MACCORMICK'S THEORY OF LEGAL REASONING, NAMELY WHAT HE CALLS 'CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING'. FOR MACCORMICK, CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING IS BOTH AN OMNIPRESENT FEATURE OF LEGAL REASONING IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND, AS WELL AS BEING A VALUABLE ONE. MACCORMICK ARTICULATES THE VALUE OF CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING BY SEEING IT AS CONTRIBUTING TO THE FORWARDLOOKING REQUIREMENT OF FORMAL JUSTICE, IE, OF DECIDING THE INSTANT CASE ON GROUNDS THAT ONE IS WILLING TO ADOPT WHEN DECIDING FUTURE SIMILAR CASES. THIS PAPER SITUATES CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING IN THE OVERALL PICTURE OF LEGAL REASONING MACCORMICK DEVELOPS IN LEGAL REASONING AND LEGAL THEORY (1978), GOING ON TO SHOW THE EVOLUTION OF HIS VIEW ON CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING IN LATER WORK, WHICH CULMINATES IN RHETORIC AND THE RULE OF LAW (2005). IT IS ARGUED THAT MACCORMICK'S LATER VIEW OF CONSEQUENTIAL REASONING, IE, OF A PROCESS OF TESTING (INCLUDING REFINING) POSSIBLE RULINGS BY EVALUATING THE ACCEPTABILITY OR UNACCEPTABILITY (IE, THE NORMATIVE STATUS) OF POSSIBLE CONDUCT UNDER THE GUISE OF THE POSSIBLE RULING IN CONCRETE HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS, IS INDEED A COMMON FEATURE OF LEGAL REASONING AND ALSO ONE OF GREAT VALUE.
248	[WITH SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS RECENTLY MADE TO THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION ACT 1974 (CTH), INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING AN EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE AND ENFORCEABLE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM IN AUSTRALIA. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER S 8 OF THE ACT, WHICH MAKES FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS READILY ENFORCEABLE, HAS GONE SO FAR AS TO CONFER THE JUDICIAL POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH ON INTERNATIONAL ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS CONTRARY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CH III OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION. THE QUESTION IS APPROACHED IN TWO WAYS: A SUBSTANCE-FOCUSED APPROACH IN LINE WITH BRANDY V HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND A MORE FORMALISTIC APPROACH FOUND IN OTHER CH III CASES. EACH COMES TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AS TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF S 8, SO THIS ARTICLE, DRAWING FROM UNITED STATES JURISPRUDENCE, ADVOCATES ANSWERING THE QUESTION IN LIGHT OF THE OBJECTS AND PURPOSES UNDERLYING CH III. FINDING THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS DO NOT UNDERMINE THE OBJECTS AND PURPOSES UNDERLYING CHILL THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FEDERAL COMPACT, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ABILITY OF AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIARY TO ENFORCE AND INTERPRET LAWS - IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENFORCING FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS UNDER S 8 DOES NOT INVEST ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS WITH JUDICIAL POWER.]
249	EVENTS OF AND SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 HAVE RENEWED INTEREST IN AGE-OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE ILL THE SHADOW OF INSECURITY, CRISIS, AND WAR. ACADEMIC LAWYERS IN PARTICULAR HAVE ENGAGED IN A VIGOROUS DEBATE ABOUT HOW LIBERAL POLITIES CAN CONFRONT SECURITY THREATS WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. YET FEW EMPIRICAL POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, AND EVEN FEWER SCHOLARS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, HAVE WEIGHED IN. THE SHORT- AND ESPECIALLY LONG-RUN EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT ON LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES REMAIN ALL UNDEREXPLORED ASPECT OF THE SECOND-IMAGE-REVERSED. PROMPTED BY RECENT RESEARCH IN LAW, THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT PROMINENT ARGUMENTS OFTEN REST ON SHAKY THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS. IT ARGUES THAT THE TWO MOST NOTABLE TRADITIONS OF THOUGHT. ON WAR AND DEMOCRACY ARE COMPLEMENTARY, NOT COMPETING; THAT SMALL WARS MAY ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONSEQUENCES; AND THAT ANALYSTS MUST DISTINGUISH CLEARLY AMONG THREE DISTINCT CAUSAL PHENOMENA-THREAT, MOBILIZATION, AND WARFARE-WHEN CONSIDERING CONFLICT'S IMPACT OIL DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE EFFECTS OF CONFLICT ON BOTH PARTICIPATION AND CONTESTATION; IDENTIFIES THE SALIENT OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTS HYPOTHESES ADDRESSING THEM; AND EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CONTEMPORARY NORMATIVE DEBATES OVER EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY AND EMERGENCY POWERS.
250	THE STARTING PREMISE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT DEMOCRATIC JOURNALISM, NO MATTER ITS SPECIFICS, IS NOT VIABLE AS LONG AS STATES ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM KEY FUNCTIONS THAT CANNOT BE DELEGATED TO OTHER ACTORS. FOR JOURNALISM, AN INTRUSIVE STATE IS AS PROBLEMATIC AS A TENUOUS, CHAOTIC, AND ABSENT STATE. THIS POINT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RECOGNIZED AND INVESTIGATED IN THE LITERATURE ON THE CURRENT EXPANSION AND CONSOLIDATION OF A DEMOCRATIC PRESS WORLDWIDE. "STATELESSNESS," A CONDITION PARTICULARLY AFFECTING LARGE SWATHS OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH, DETERS THE PROSPECTS FOR THE AFFIRMATION OF JOURNALISM THAT ANCHORS DEMOCRATIC LIFE. STATE ABSENCE FACILITATES ANTI-PRESS VIOLENCE, UNDERMINES THE ECONOMIC BASIS FOR NEWS ORGANIZATIONS, AND WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PRESS, AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS HISTORICALLY PLAYED KEY ROLES IN BUILDING AND RENOVATING NATIONAL IDENTITIES AND MEDIATING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, CAN ALSO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO STRENGTHENING EFFECTIVE AND DEMOCRATIC STATES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING WAYS IN WHICH THE PRESS SUPPORTS STATE-BUILDING PROCESSES. IT IS ARGUED THAT ALTHOUGH JOURNALISM AS CIVIC INSTITUTION ALONE CANNOT ADDRESS ENTRENCHED PROBLEMS OF VIOLENCE, SECURITY, AND LAWLESSNESS, IT CONTRIBUTES TO STATEBUILDING THROUGH MONITORING STATE ACTIONS, RAISING ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS, AND IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS.
251	INFORMED BY THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS ON LEGAL PLURALISM, THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE THE RE-ARTICULATION OF MUTUAL TRUST IN EUROPEAN CRIMINAL LAW BY ANALYSING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COURTS AS THE KEY ACTORS OF MUTUAL TRUST FROM BOTH A HORIZONTAL PERSPECTIVE (LOOKING AT THE DEGREE OF MUTUAL ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN LEGAL ORDERS AND THE IMPACT ON AUTOMATICITY IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND THE SCRUTINY OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS IN THE PROCESS OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION) AND FROM A VERTICAL PERSPECTIVE (LOOKING AT QUESTIONS OF AUTHORITY, SUPREMACY AND HIERARCHY THAT DEMANDS OF MUTUAL TRUST MAY ENTAIL). THE ARTICLE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE EMERGENCE OF AN INTER-LINKED SYSTEM OF A THREE-LEVEL DIALOGUE (BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) AND NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS/THE STRASBOURG COURT; BETWEEN THE ECJ AND NATIONAL COURTS UNDER THE PRELIMINARY REFERENCE PROCEDURE; AND BETWEEN NATIONAL JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES IN THEIR OPERATION OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW) SYSTEM) TO MANAGE PLURALISM IN EUROPE'S AREA OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THE IMPACT OF THIS MULTI-LAYERED JUDICIAL DIALOGUE ON ORDERING PLURALISM THROUGH PROVIDING CREDIBLE ANSWERS TO CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS RELATED TO THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE CRITICALLY EVALUATED.
252	DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIONS ARE DEVELOPING RAPIDLY IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE. THE RUSSIAN FEDERAL PENITENTIARY SERVICE (FSIN OF RUSSIA) GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY IN PRISONS. MODERN APPROACHES TO THE DIGITAL SYSTEM FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTION OF RISKS FOR FSIN OF RUSSIA ARE AIMED AT ADAPTING THE DIGITAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS AND THEIR KEY INDICATORS TO PREDICTING TECHNIQUES IN PENITENTIARY INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN LITERATURE, WE STUDIED INMATE MISCONDUCT AND ITS MANIFESTATIONS IN PRISONS USING DIGITAL TOOLS. THE STUDY OF INMATE MISCONDUCT AND ITS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS ALLOWED US TO ASCERTAIN THE HETEROGENEITY OF THEIR DESTRUCTIVE MANIFESTATIONS. IT WAS SUGGESTED TO IDENTIFY RISK CATEGORIES OF THE INMATES BASED ON THE BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES. WE PROPOSED THE ALGORITHM FOR RECOGNIZING MISCONDUCT RISKS USING THE CAPABILITIES AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, INNOVATIVE MODELING AND FORECASTING METHODS, WHICH WERE TAKEN AS THE FOUNDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING AN ABSTRACT INMATE'S RISK MISCONDUCT MODEL. BASED ON COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND BIG DATA, THE NECESSITY OF INTEGRATING THE EXISTING TYPES INTO A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM WAS SUBSTANTIATED. THE IMPORTANCE OF ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR PREDICTING INMATE MISCONDUCT WAS EMPHASIZED.
253	POPULISM IS OFTEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE APPEAL TO A HOMOGENEOUS WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND IT IS THEREFORE OPPOSED TO CONSTITUTIONALISM FOR ITS OVER-MAJORITARIAN TENDENCIES AND ITS REJECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH A COMMON VIEW, TYPICAL OF MOST EUROPEAN LEGAL AND POLITICAL THEORY SCHOLARS, UNDERESTIMATES THE OPPOSITIONAL AND DEFENSIVE ASPECT OF POPULISM, WHICH BECOMES CLEAR WHEN EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE ANTI-ELITIST PRONG OF THE PHENOMENON. SUCH A PERSPECTIVE IS MOST COMMONLY CARRIED OUT BY THE US LITERATURE WHERE POPULISM IS NOT SIMPLY OPPOSED TO CONSTITUTIONALISM AND WHERE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS QUALIFY THEMSELVES AS POPULIST. FOLLOWING WHAT WILL BE DEFINED AS THE AMERICAN LESSON, IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT POPULISM IS, ON ITS ESSENCE, ROOTED ON A DEEP DISTRUST TOWARDS POWER AND AIMS AT COMPETING WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM ON THE FIELD OF LIMITING PUBLIC POWER. HOWEVER, WHILE POPULISM IS ENGAGED IN A BATTLE AGAINST ANY FORM OF OLIGARCHY, CONSTITUTIONALISM FOLLOWS A DIFFERENT PATH. BY DESCRIBING HOW POPULISM AND JUDICIAL REVIEW RELATE TO EACH OTHER IT WILL BE POINTED OUT HOW POPULISM'S AND CONSTITUTIONALISM'S CAMPAIGNS FOR A LIMITED POWER MAY SOMETIME OVERLAP BUT MOST OFTEN DEPART.
254	PROTECTED AREAS HAVE BECOME POPULAR TOURISM DESTINATIONS; YET THESE AREAS ARE OFTEN PLAGUED BY POOR GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ADAPTIVE CO-MANAGEMENT (ACM) HAS BEEN ADVOCATED AS ONE APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS, YET EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS LACKING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE APPLICATION OF THE ACM APPROACH IN TWO PROTECTED AREAS IN BANGLADESH WHICH ARE ALSO IMPORTANT NATURE-BASED TOURISM DESTINATIONS. USING LAWACHARA NATIONAL PARK AND SUNDARBANS EAST WILDLIFE SANCTUARY AS CASES, THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE EXTENT TO WHICH AN ACM APPROACH WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF KEY GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES SUCH AS PARTICIPATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, POWER, RULE OF LAW, AND SOCIAL LEARNING. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE APPROACH WAS SUCCESSFUL IN FACILITATING THE INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, AND THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THEM. IMPORTANTLY THOUGH, IT WAS THE ADAPTIVE ELEMENT OF ACM WHICH WAS FOUND TO HAVE MADE THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTION TO IMPROVED GOVERNANCE WITH THE APPROACH PROVIDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE IN ITERATIVE LEARNING. THIS ASPECT WAS FOUND TO BE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROTECTED AREAS WITH STAKEHOLDERS REPORTING CHANGES ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS PROTECTED AREA CONSERVATION.
255	THE SCOPE OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE WHETHER AUSTERITY MEASURES DEVELOPED DURING SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISES THAT ARISE RESTRICTIONS TO SOCIAL AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MAY BE CONSIDERED VALID UNDER THE BASIS OF THE LEGAL PRAGMATISM. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE INTEND TO INVESTIGATE IF GENERAL PRINCIPLES SUCH AS EQUALITY AND THE PROHIBITION TO THE "RATCHET EFFECT" MAY PREVENT THESE MEASURES TO THE ADOPTED, AS WELL AS TO OFFER PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH THE VALIDATION OF ANTI -CRISES ACTIONS SHOULD BE SCRUTINIZED. UNDER THESE CONSTRAINTS, WE INTEND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT, ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE ROOM TO ADAPT THE LEGAL SYSTEM INTO THE REALITY, ANTI-CRISES MEASURES CANNOT BE SEEN AS NON -JURIDICAL SPACES; INSTEAD, THEY MUST BE SURROUNDED BY BASILAR VALUES TO THE RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS HUMAN DIGNITY AND DEMOCRACY. FINALLY, WE INTEND TO OFFER LIMITS AND PARAMETERS APPLICABLE TO MOMENTS WHEN, DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE ECONOMIC CRISES, THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS CANNOT PROVIDE THE MINIMUM NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THE PRESERVATION OF HUMAN DIGNITY, IN ORDER TO REESTABLISH IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OR, AT LEAST, TO NOT DETERIORATE THE SCARCITY SITUATION.
256	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN EXPLORATION OF WHAT IT MEANT TO MOVE UNDER "CRAMPED CONDITIONS" FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THEIR COMPATRIOTS DURING AN ERA OF OFTEN VIOLENT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION IN THE 1950S AND 1960S IN THE USA. AS THE EXAMPLE OF THE FREEDOM RIDES SHOWS, THESE CONDITIONS INCLUDED BOTH MOMENTS OF CLOSURE AND ENTRAPMENT DETERMINED BY THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS ACTS OF RESISTANCE RESULTING FROM A CENTURY-LONG LEGACY OF RESISTANCES. PARTICULARLY, I TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEX "CONSTELLATIONS OF MOBILITY" AS A FRAGILE ENTANGLEMENT OF THE POLITICS OF MOVEMENT, REPRESENTATIONS OF MOVEMENT, AND THE EMBODIED PRACTICES OF MOVEMENT. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN APPROACH TO MOBILITY THAT TAKES BOTH HISTORICAL FORMS OF MOBILITIES AND IMMOBILITIES SERIOUSLY. ON THE ONE HAND, MY ANALYSIS RELATES TO REGULATORY POWER AND TECHNOLOGIES USED BY STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS IN ORDER TO RETAIN WHITE PRIVILEGE OVER ISSUES OF MOBILITY DURING THE PERIOD PRECEDING AND ACCOMPANYING THE FREEDOM RIDES. ON THE OTHER HAND, I ARGUE ALONG THE LINES OF "MOBILITY AS RESISTANCE" BY SHOWING THE STRATEGIES USED TO TRANSGRESS WRITTEN AND UNWRITTEN LAWS AND NORMATIVE STANDARDS OF THE JIM CROW ERA.
257	THIS PAPER AIMS TO REVIEW THE DISCOURSE OF SEXUAL MORALITY AS RECENTLY STAGED BY CHRISTIAN EVANGELICAL GROUPS IN HONG KONG AND THE EFFECTS OF THIS NEW ROUND OF EVANGELICAL ACTIVISM ON THE SHAPING OF RECENT POLITICAL CULTURE IN HONG KONG. UNLIKE THE MORAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST DECRIMINALIZATION OF HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE 1980S, WHICH EVENTUALLY LOST TO THE REASONING OF BRITISH RULE OF LAW IMPLICIT IN HONG KONG LEGISLATURE, THIS NEW CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT FOR THE DEFENSE OF SEXUAL MORALITY IN HONG KONG IS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTURE OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION BETWEEN THE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT AND THE PRO-ESTABLISHMENT POLITICAL FORCES, INCLUDING PRO-BEIJING BUSINESSMEN, POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PERSONNEL. WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF IDEOLOGICAL AND STRATEGIC AFFINITY WITH THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT MOVEMENT, WHICH COLLABORATES WITH CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EVANGELICAL CAMPAIGNERS OF HONG KONG, WHETHER CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT, HAVE GAINED MUCH POLITICAL CURRENCY IN COLLABORATING WITH THE PRO-ESTABLISHMENT FORCES OF HONG KONG. AS A RESULT, SEXUAL MORALITY ARTICULATED IN THE NAME OF THE PRESERVATION OF TRADITIONS, WHETHER THEY ARE CHRISTIAN OR CHINESE, HAS FED AN AUTOCRATIC POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF HONG KONG THAT PARTAKES THE DANGEROUSLY DIVISIVE POLITICS OF THE FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS AROUND THE GLOBE.
258	A CENTRAL CONCEPT IN EARLY MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT, ESPECIALLY IN ENGLAND, IS THE NOTION OF THE "STATE OF NATURE." THOMAS HOBBES AND, ONE GENERATION LATER, JOHN LOCKE, USE IT AS THE "CLEAN SLATE" OR "GROUND ZERO" FOR CONTRACTUALIST THEORIES ON POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY. MORE THAN JUST A CONDITION IN WHICH EVERYONE FIGHTS AGAINST EVERYONE FOR SURVIVAL, "STATE OF NATURE" DENOTES THE MAXIMAL COMPLEXITY OF A SOCIETY WITHOUT A CENTRAL AUTHORITY. CONTRACTUALIST THINKERS SUCH AS HOBBES AND LOCKE CLOSE THE DOOR OF GOVERNMENTAL ANOMY BY DEVELOPING A STRONG REGIME OR A STRICT RULE OF LAW, BUT LIBERTINISM PROFITS FROM THE GAP BETWEEN THE REAL AND THE LEGAL SOCIETY BY IMAGINING THE RULE OF LUST. THE NATURE OF THESE "LIBIDINAL POLITICS" IS MOST POTENTLY REPRESENTED BY THE POEMS AND PERFORMANCES OF JOHN WILMOT, SECOND EARL OF ROCHESTER, COURTIER OF KING CHARLES II. BY MEANS OF A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF LIBERTINISM ON RESTORATION GOVERNMENTALITY IS COMPARED TO THE MOST RADICAL LIBERTINE DOCTRINE: THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MARQUIS DE SADE. ONE CENTURY LATER AND IN A VERY DIFFERENT HISTORICAL REGIME, SADE'S EXTREMISM NEVERTHELESS SHEDS A LIGHT ON THE DISCONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL SECULARISM IN ENGLAND.
259	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AND ANALYZES A SET OF INSTITUTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF VIOLENCE THAT TOOK PLACE IN A LATE COLONIAL SITUATION THE FRENCH TERRITORY OF AFARS AND ISSAS FROM 1966 UP TO ITS INDEPENDENCE IN 1977 WITH THE ANNOUNCED AIM OF BLOCKING MIGRULORY MOVEMENTS AND MAINTAINING FRENCH SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE TERRITORY. 'THE PRESENT ARTICLE DESCRIBES THIS VIOLENCE MOSTLY PERFORMED BY MILITARY FORCES ("BARRAGE," ENDLESS PHYSICAL CONTROL OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE AUTOCHTHONOUS AREAS, RAIDS, EVICTIONS, INDEXING; ETC.), AND THE WAY IT WAS LEGITIMIZED BY AN IDENTITY ASSIGNATION PROCESS, THE METHODS AND IDEOLOGICAL RESOURCES OF WHICH ARE EXPLAINED. THIS EXAMPLE FROM A RECENT PAST SHOWS THE STAKES AND METHODS OF MIGRATION CONTROL, AND THE POSSIBLE INFRINGEMENT ON THE RULE OF LAW IT CAN CAUSE IN A POST-COLONIAL STATE. ITS STUDY, HOWEVER, SHOWS THAT THE COLONIAL SITUATION IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN ITSELF TO EXPLAIN THIS USE OF EXTRAORDINARY COERCIVE PROCEDURES. THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY, BUT ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFICULTIES OF ITS CONSTRUCTION. THIS SITUATION IS PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE TECHNOLOGIES OF INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE AFTER WORLD WAR II, MOSTLY APPLIED TO "FOREIGNERS."
260	RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BROUGHT INTO QUESTION THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THIS CONTRIBUTION FOCUSES ON THE HARMONISATION OF "DATA RETENTION" RULES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN PARTICULAR THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE (2006/24). IT FIRST CONSIDERS THE INITIATION OF SECONDARY EU LEGISLATION ON DATA RETENTION AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS OF THE RETENTION OF "TRAFFIC DATA" FOR THE PURPOSE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT THEN DISCUSSES CHALLENGES AGAINST DOMESTIC IMPLEMENTATION LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY NGOS. THE ANALYSIS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HARMONISATION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT TELECOM OPERATORS AND INTERN ET PROVIDERS MUST RETAIN DATA, ALONG WITH OTHER MEASURES REGARDING THE PROSECUTION OF CRIME, HAVE NOT MET WITH SUCCESS. THESE MEASURES HAVE RATHER GENERATED UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE FORM THAT DATA RETENTION SHOULD TAKE VIS-A-VIS THE PERMISSIBLE DEGREE OF CENTRALISATION OF POWER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE ADOPTION OF LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS FOR ABUSES OF RETAINED DATA CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. WITH AN ECJ PRELIMINARY RULING PENDING ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF DIRECTIVE 2006/24, THIS DEBATE IS ALL THE MORE INTERESTING.
261	IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE THAT JOHN DEWEY DEVELOPED A PHILOSOPHY OF LAW THAT FOLLOWS DIRECTLY FROM HIS CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY. INDEED, UNDER DEWEY'S THEORY AN UNDERSTANDING OF LAW CAN ONLY FOLLOW FROM AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH IT FUNCTIONS. THIS HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FORM LAW TAKES WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. THE PAPER WILL EXPLORE THESE IMPLICATIONS THROUGH A COMPARISON OF DEWEY'S CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF RICHARD POSNER AND RONALD DWORKIN; TWO OTHER THEORISTS THAT INTIMATELY LINK LAW AND DEMOCRACY. AFTER OUTLINING THEIR THEORIES I WILL USE THE RECENT UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CASE, CITIZENS UNITED, TO DISCUSS HOW PRACTITIONERS OF THE THREE THEORIES WOULD DECIDE A CASE THAT IMPLICATES BOTH THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES. IN ORDER TO DO THIS JUDGES FOLLOWING EACH THEORY, "DEWS, DWORKS AND POSES,"ARE IMAGINED. ULTIMATELY THIS PAPER WILL SHOW THAT DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS TO CITIZENS UNITED WOULD FOLLOW. THE (TENTATIVE) CONCLUSION OF THE PAPER IS THAT DEWEY'S CONCEPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND LAW IS A SUPERIOR OPTION TO EITHER THAT OF DWORKIN OR POSNER.
262	ZONES OF STATE FAILURE ARE ASSUMED TO BE ANARCHIC. IN REALITY, COMMUNITIES FACING THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE STATE AUTHORITY FORGE SYSTEMS OF GOVERNANCE TO PROVIDE MODEST LEVELS OF SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW. NOWHERE IS THIS PHENOMENON MORE EVIDENT THAN IN SOMALIA, WHERE AN ARRAY OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE EMERGED SINCE THE 1991 COLLAPSE OF THE STATE. THE SOMALIA CASE CAN BE USED BOTH TO DOCUMENT THE RISE OF GOVERNANCE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT IN A ZONE OF STATE COLLAPSE AND TO ASSESS THE CHANGING INTERESTS OF LOCAL ACTORS SEEKING TO SURVIVE AND PROSPER IN A CONTEXT OF STATE FAILURE. THE INTERESTS OF KEY ACTORS CAN AND DO SHIFT OVER TIME AS THEY ACCRUE RESOURCES AND INVESTMENTS; THE SHIFT "FROM WARLORD TO LANDLORD" GIVES SOME ACTORS GREATER INTERESTS IN GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY, BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN STATE REVIVAL; RISK AVERSION INFUSES DECISIONMAKING IN AREAS OF STATE FAILURE; AND STATE-BUILDING INITIATIVES GENERALLY FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THE POSSIBILITIES AND PROBLEMS OF THE "MEDIATED STATE MODEL," IN WHICH WEAK STATES NEGOTIATE POLITICAL ACCESS THROUGH EXISTING LOCAL AUTHORITIES, ARE CONSIDERABLE.
263	MODERNIZATION DEALS WITH THE POSITIVE, RELATIVELY COMPUTABLE COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE MARKET SYSTEM. ITS MAIN INDICATORS ARE RATIONALITY, PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH MONEY MARKET PRICE COORDINATION, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION. MODERNITY DEALS WITH WHAT ALL THIS MEANS IN MORAL TERMS, AND INCLUDES THE NOTION OF FAIRNESS, RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY/CIVIL SOCIETY, AND CHARACTER. MODERNIZATION REFERS TO WEALTH; MODERNITY TO WELL-BEING OR VIRTUE. MODERNIZATION WITHOUT OR WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LAGGING MODERNITY REPRESENTS AN UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM OR SOCIAL PATHOLOGY, WHICH IF LEFT UNCORRECTED CAN LEAD TO THE BREAKDOWN OR REVERSAL OF MODERNIZATION. IDEALLY MODERNIZATION AND MODERNITY SHOULD BE COMBINED IN A MATERIALLY PROSPEROUS AND VIRTUOUS COMMERCIAL REPUBLIC OR MARKET DEMOCRACY. PRACTICE SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT INEVITABLE, TO APPROACH THIS COMBINATION BECAUSE SEVERAL KEY ATTRIBUTES OF MODERNIZATION--SUCH AS TECHNICAL ADVANCE IN THE REALM OF INFORMATION, MONEY MARKET PRICES, AND PRIVATE PROPERTY--TEND TO ATTRACT AND REINFORCE ELEMENTS OF MODERNITY, SUCH AS POLITICAL PLURALISM, AND VICE VERSA. COMBINED, MODERNIZATION AND MODERNITY, CAPITALISM AND DEMOCRACY, ''ARE MORE PROTECTIVE OF THE RIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CONSCIENCE OF ORDINARY CITIZENS (ALL CITIZENS) THAN ANY KNOWN ALTERNATIVE.''
264	STUDIES ON THE DETERMINANTS OF BANK STABILITY CONCLUDE THAT BANK-SPECIFIC AND EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECT BANK FINANCIAL STABILITY. HOWEVER, MOST OF THESE STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHERE BANKS, ON AVERAGE, ARE RICHER AND HAVE MORE LIQUIDITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECT OF BANK-SPECIFIC AND EXTERNAL FACTORS ON BANK STABILITY IN A LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRY-ETHIOPIA USING COMMERCIAL BANKS DATA FROM 2014 TO 2020. BY USING TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATION, WE FIND THAT BANK LENDING RATE, TANGIBILITY, GDP GROWTH RATE, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW EFFECTIVENESS STABILIZE BANK FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE EFFECT IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR BANKS WITH HIGH MARKET SHARE OF MOBILIZED CAPITAL. ON THE OTHER HAND, BANK CONCENTRATION AND BANK EFFICIENCY REDUCE BANK FINANCIAL STABILITY BY ABOUT 2.51 AND 0.97 UNITS, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE EFFECT OF HISTORICAL LEVEL OF BANK STABILITY HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CURRENT LEVEL OF BANK FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS RESULT IS VITAL FOR POLICY-MAKERS, AS IT EXPLICITLY SUGGESTS THAT KEEPING BANK STABILITY TODAY HAS A VITAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING HIGHER BANK STABILITY IN THE FUTURE.
265	ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INEQUALITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT IDENTITY GROUPS IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO VIOLENT CONFLICTS WITHIN SOCIETIES. TO DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DYNAMICS, WE DEVELOP A MATHEMATICAL MODEL DESCRIBING COOPERATION AND CONFLICT IN A SOCIETY COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE FACTIONS ENGAGED IN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INTERACTIONS. OUR MODEL PREDICTS THAT GROWING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INEQUALITY TENDS TO LEAD TO THE COLLAPSE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN FACTIONS THAT WERE INITIALLY SEEKING TO COOPERATE. CERTAIN MECHANISMS CAN DELAY THIS PROCESS, INCLUDING THE DECOUPLING OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER THROUGH RULE OF LAW AND ALLEGIANCE TO THE STATE OR DOMINANT FACTION. COUNTERINTUITIVELY, ANTI-CONFORMITY (A SOCIAL NORM FOR INDEPENDENT ACTION) CAN ALSO STABILIZE SOCIETY, BY PREVENTING INITIAL DEFECTIONS FROM COOPERATION FROM CASCADING THROUGH SOCIETY. HOWEVER, THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN MATERIAL RESOURCES THAT CAN BE ACQUIRED BY THE STATE WITHOUT COOPERATION WITH OTHER FACTIONS HAS THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. WE TEST SEVERAL OF THESE PREDICTIONS USING A MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA COVERING 75 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. USING SOCIAL UNREST AS A PROXY FOR THE BREAKDOWN OF COOPERATION IN SOCIETY, WE FIND SUPPORT FOR MANY OF THE PREDICTIONS FROM OUR THEORY.
266	CAN AN ORDER FOR A PRELIMINARY REFERENCE TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE COURT), MADE BY A LOWER INSTANCE NATIONAL COURT, BE SUBJECT TO AN APPEAL TO A HIGHER INSTANCE NATIONAL COURT? TO DATE, THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR ON AN ANSWER TO THIS EXACT QUESTION. THE COURT'S CARTESIO JUDGMENT MANDATED THAT NATIONAL LAW COULD NOT PERMIT A HIGHER INSTANCE NATIONAL COURT FROM VARYING AN ORDER FOR REFERENCE, SETTING ASIDE AN ORDER FOR REFERENCE, OR ORDERING THE RESUMPTION OF NATIONAL PROCEEDINGS WHILST AWAITING THE RETURN OF THE PRELIMINARY REFERENCE. HOWEVER, THE COURT DID NOT SAY THAT APPEALS AGAINST AN ORDER FOR REFERENCE, MORE GENERALLY, WERE INCOMPATIBLE, PER SE, WITH UNION LAW. THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT SUCH BREADTH GIVEN TO HIGHER INSTANCE NATIONAL COURTS IS CONTRARY TO THE INTENT OF ARTICLE 267 TFEU, WHICH AIMS TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL DIALOGUE BETWEEN ALL NATIONAL COURTS AND THE COURT, UNINTERRUPTED BY NATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THE CASE FOR ENDING THIS REGIME OF UNDUE DEFERENCE TO NATIONAL PROCEDURAL AUTONOMY ON THIS QUESTION, WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN ALL MEMBER STATES CANNOT BE ASSUMED.
267	KOSOVO'S STATEHOOD HAS BEEN CONTESTED BY FOES AS WELL AS FRIENDS. MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FORMER AND LESS ABOUT THE LATTER. THIS CONTRIBUTION EXPLORES THE CONTESTATION OF KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE BY THE JUDGES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX) WORKING ON PRIVATIZATION MATTERS BEFORE KOSOVO COURTS. AS PUT BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOSOVO (KCC), EULEX JUDGES WORKING ON PRIVATIZATION MATTERS, "SIMPLY CONTINUED TO IGNORE THE EXISTENCE OF KOSOVO AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE AND ITS LEGISLATION EMANATING FROM ITS ASSEMBLY". THE KCC STATED THIS AFTER EULEX JUDGES WORKING ON PRIVATIZATION MATTERS HAD REFUSED TO RESPECT KOSOVO LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE 2008 KOSOVO DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE JUDICIAL DIALOGUE ON KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN EULEX JUDGES AND THE KCC AND IDENTIFIES THE LIMITATIONS AND RISKS OF THE 'STATUS NEUTRAL' POLICY APPLIED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COLLABORATE WITH KOSOVAR INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT PREJUDGING ITS POLITICAL STATUS. THIS SUBMISSION SUGGESTS THAT 'STATUS NEUTRALITY' LEADS TO EITHER ACCEPTANCE OR CONTESTATION OF KOSOVO'S STATEHOOD AND THUS BRINGS MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN CLARITY TO KOSOVO'S POSITION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.
268	OF THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE IN THE ANTI-CORRUPTION ARSENAL OF NATIONS, CIVIL SOCIETY USUALLY PLAYS AN AMBIVALENT ROLE. IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE DECISIVE IN HELPING TO COUNTER CORRUPTION, DEPENDING ON OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, ALTHOUGH IN DEVELOPED SOCIETIES WITH A STRONG TRADITION OF RULE OF LAW IT CAN MAKE A DEFINITE CONTRIBUTION. IN POST-COMMUNIST UKRAINE, WHERE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP FOR REASONS OF SELF-INTEREST HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO PURSUE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY EFFECTIVELY, AND WHERE AGENCIES CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED BY POLITICAL INTERFERENCE, INFIGHTING, AND LACK OF CO-ORDINATION, THE QUESTION URGENTLY ARISES WHETHER CIVIL SOCIETY COULD COMPENSATE FOR THESE SHORTCOMINGS SO AS TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE CHANGE. IS CIVIL SOCIETY UKRAINE'S "LAST BEST HOPE" TO CONTROL POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND SALVAGE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGIME? FOR THIS TO HAPPEN, ACCORDING TO THE THEORY PUT FORWARD BY MARCIA GRIMES AND APPLIED HERE, PRESS FREEDOM, POLITICAL PARTY COMPETITION, AND GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY MUST ALL BE AT A HIGH LEVEL. WITHOUT THESE CRITICAL SOURCES OF SUPPORT UKRAINIAN CIVIL SOCIETY CANNOT BE COUNTED ON TO MANAGE THE STRUGGLE AGAINST CORRUPTION SUCCESSFULLY ALONE. THE FINDINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER POST-COMMUNIST STATES.
269	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE RECENT WAVE OF STAGED CONFESSIONS IN CHINA IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. CURRENTLY, THE AUTHORITIES "DISAPPEAR," DETAIN, AND PARADE PEOPLE, BOTH CHINESE AND FOREIGNERS, ON STATE TELEVISION, FORCING THEM TO INCRIMINATE THEMSELVES BY MAKING ABJECT CONFESSIONS PRIOR TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THIS IS A CLEAR BREAK WITH YEARS OF EFFORTS TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IT ALSO REVERSES MULTIPLE SOLEMN DECLARATIONS TO PROHIBIT POLICE TORTURE AND FORCED CONFESSIONS, BOTH LONGSTANDING PRACTICES IN CHINA. THE NEW EXTRAJUDICIAL SHOW TRIALS, WHICH ARE STAGED SPECTACLES OUTSIDE COURTS OF LAW, SUGGEST A RETURN TO MAO-ERA PRAXIS, AND HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY MANY, INCLUDING LEADING CHINESE JUDGES AND LAWYERS. DESPITE THE PAINSTAKING CHOREOGRAPHY, THE TV CONFESSIONS ARE WIDELY REGARDED BOTH IN CHINA AND INTERNATIONALLY AS FAKE-NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF SEVERAL NEW WITNESS ACCOUNTS PROVIDED BY FORMER DETAINEES WHICH EMERGED DURING 2016. ELEMENTS FOR A HISTORICALLY GROUNDED INTERPRETATION EMERGE FROM EXAMINATION OF SOVIET COMMUNIST, CHRISTIAN, AND VARIOUS EAST ASIAN PARALLELS. KAFKA'S ALLEGORY IN THE TRIAL EXPOSES HOW THE POWERFUL FRAME THE INNOCENT BY FORCING THEM TO "CONFESS," IN ORDER TO PERPETUATE THEIR POWER.
270	WE EXPLORE THE DETERMINANTS OF THE GREEK SHADOW ECONOMY, ITS INTERACTION WITH THE OFFICIAL ECONOMY, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CORRUPTION. IN DOING SO, WE UNDERTAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME AN INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEW OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL STUDIES ON THE SIZE AND DETERMINANTS OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY, TAX EVASION, UNDECLARED WORK AND, MOREOVER, OF THEIR RELATION WITH CORRUPTION IN GREECE IN ORDER TO REVEAL THE EXTENT AND COMPLEXITY OF THESE PHENOMENA. WE ESTIMATE THE SIZE AND DETERMINANTS OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY VIA A MULTIPLE-INDICATORS-MULTIPLE-CAUSES (MIMIC) APPROACH. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS ARE FACTORS RELATED TO MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT AND GDP GROWTH, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, SUCH AS TAX MORALE AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE ALSO INDICATE THAT THE SHADOW ECONOMY AND CORRUPTION ARE COMPLEMENTARY AND THAT THE OFFICIAL AND THE SHADOW ECONOMY SUBSTITUTE EACH OTHER OVER THE BUSINESS CYCLE. AN ADOPTION OF POLICY BASED ON THESE FINDINGS WOULD LEAD TO A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF PART OF THE SHADOW ECONOMY TO THE OFFICIAL ECONOMY, WOULD BOOST GOVERNMENT REVENUE, AND WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD THE GREEK ECONOMY OUT OF THE DEPRESSION THAT EMERGED AS A RESULT OF THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS.
271	SOCIETY, THROUGHOUT HISTORY, HAS WALKED SLOWLY TOWARD MORE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL MODELS. THE CONSOLIDATION OF EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES, THE POPULAR CLAIM THROUGH SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED THE AWARENESS OF THE POPULATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC MODELS WHICH THE INSTITUTIONS ENSURE NOT ONLY FORMAL EQUALITY AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, BUT MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO UPDATE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF PEOPLE TO HAVE AUTONOMY IN DECISION MAKING AND, THEREFORE, STRONG DEMOCRACIES. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AT DEVELOPING NEW MODELS OF DEMOCRACY, DIFFERENT THAN THE EXISTING ONES, ARE BEING DESIGNED AND TESTED AROUND THE WORLD. THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS AND THE STUDY OF SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCES IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR THINKING ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION IN PUBLIC LIFE, AND TO AVOIDING MISTAKES THAT, IN THE PAST, HAS LED US TO TOTALITARIAN REGIMES. THE METHOD USED WAS THE DEDUCTIVE ONE AND THE TECHNIQUE IS THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH, STARTING FROM THE ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF TOTALITARIAN AND DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS IN THE 20TH CENTURY, AS WELL AS THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
272	AS CHINA'S NATIONAL IMAGE IS HAUNTED BY ITS POOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS AND INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE FOREIGN POLICIES, THE CHINESE DIASPORA HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT PLATFORM FOR THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC DIPLOMACY. SINCE XI JINPING CAME TO POWER, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO LAUNCH SOFT POWER CAMPAIGNS IN ORDER TO BETTER ENGAGE THE 50 MILLION OVERSEAS CHINESE AND COMMUNICATE CHINA'S IDEAS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. THE XI ADMINISTRATION'S DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT POLICIES FOCUS ON: (1) INDIGENISING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION TO IMPROVE CHINA'S NATIONAL IMAGE; (2) JUMP-STARTING IMMIGRATION REFORM TO WIN THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF OVERSEAS CHINESE; AND (3) STRENGTHENING EDUCATION EXCHANGES TO SHAPE THE DIASPORIC IDENTITY OF OVERSEAS CHINESE. THROUGH HISTORICAL COMPARISONS AND POLICY ANALYSES, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA'S CURRENT DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT POLICIES ARE BASED ON THE CHINESE LEADERS' NEW VISION OF PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, WHICH IS APPROACHED WITH SOFT POWER STRATEGY. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITS OF CHINESE SOFT POWER - PARTICULARLY THE LACK OF POLITICAL REFORM AND RULE OF LAW - THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE TO ATTAIN ITS LONG-LASTING APPEAL OF SOFT POWER AND IMPLEMENT ITS DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT POLICIES EFFECTIVELY.
273	WEAK RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL RISK ARE FACTORS FOUND TO DETER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AND ALL ARE CHARACTERISTICS OF CAMBODIA'S INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT. YET CHINESE OUTWARD FDI HAS BEEN FOUND TO CONTRADICT THESE GENERAL TRENDS, AS ILLUSTRATED BY HIGH LEVELS OF CHINESE INVESTMENT IN CAMBODIA. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW CHINESE FIRMS ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INVEST IN CAMBODIA AND FINDS THAT VARIATION IN OWNERSHIP TYPE (STATE OWNED OR PRIVATE), INVESTMENT SIZE AND THE DEGREE OF MOBILITY OF THE ASSETS INVESTED DETERMINE THE CHINESE INVESTOR'S STRATEGY. FOR CHINA'S STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) IN THE HYDROPOWER SECTOR, CHINESE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF AID AND LOANS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CAMBODIA SECURES APPROVAL AND PROTECTION FOR INVESTMENTS. PRIVATE CHINESE FIRMS WITH SMALLER AND MORE MOBILE INVESTMENTS IN CAMBODIA'S GARMENT INDUSTRY, ON THE OTHER HAND, RELY ON INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE ACTION FACILITATED BY CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC TIES BOTH TO OTHER ETHNICALLY CHINESE FOREIGN INVESTORS AND TO CHINESE CAMBODIANS IN THE INDUSTRY. FINALLY, IN THE LAND AND RESOURCE SECTOR, CHINESE FIRMS SECURE A POLITICALLY CONNECTED LOCAL STAKEHOLDER TO GAIN APPROVAL AND PROTECTION FOR LARGE INVESTMENTS.
274	DRAWING ON THE WORK OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HUNGARIAN POLITICAL SCIENTIST, ISTVAN BIBO, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF HUNGARY'S NEW CONSTITUTION, OR FUNDAMENTAL LAW, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JANUARY 2012. HUNGARY'S FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND VARIOUS ASSOCIATED LEGAL TEXTS HAVE BEEN HEAVILY CRITICIZED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) PARLIAMENT, THE ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE), THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S VENICE COMMISSION, THE US STATE DEPARTMENT, MAJOR HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS AND FOREIGN AS WELL AS HUNGARIAN SCHOLARS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL REGIME THAT OPERATED IN HUNGARY FROM THE END OF COMMUNIST RULE UNTIL JANUARY 2012 REPRESENTED A BROADLY SATISFACTORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND MINORITY BY CONTRAST, THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW, RELATED LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND VARIOUS POLICIES OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAVE DILUTED OR THREATENED ESSENTIAL DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE REMOVAL OF MANY OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED WITHIN THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THESE REGRESSIVE MEASURES SUGGEST THAT ELEMENTS OF WHAT ISTVAN DESCRIBED AS THE 'DEFORMED' POLITICAL CULTURE OF PRE-WORLD WIR II HUNGARY HAVE REASSERTED THEMSELVES.
275	SKEPTICISM PREVAILS AMONG A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ECONOMISTS OVER A POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. UNTIL NOW, EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS FOUND MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE INFLUENCE OF CIVIL LIBERTIES. DISAGGREGATION OF THE FREEDOM HOUSE CIVIL LIBERTIES INDEX ALLOWS A FRESH EMPIRICAL LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON LONG-TERM GROWTH OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ONE OF THE FOUR SUBCATEGORIES OF THE INDEX OUTPERFORMS ALL AVAILABLE INDICATORS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS IN EXPLAINING LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS SUBCATEGORY, PERSONAL AUTONOMY AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, CAPTURES THE LEVEL OF SECOND GENERATION HUMAN RIGHTS THAT AFFECT THE MOBILITY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS RESULT IS ROBUST WITH RESPECT TO REVERSE CAUSATION, IMPORTANT OMITTED VARIABLES SUCH AS GEOGRAPHY AND HUMAN CAPITAL, AS WELL AS TO A VARIETY OF SENSITIVITY TESTS. WE ALSO DISCUSS IN OUR CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK HOW CIVIL LIBERTIES WORK AS AN INDICATOR OF THE PREVALENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HOW THE LATTER AFFECTS GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT AS AN ESSENTIAL PUBLIC INPUT.
276	THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION OF KOREA IS MARKED BY TWO IMPORTANT CHANGES: THE DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS ARE THE ORIGIN OF RECENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE REPUBLICAN RESTORATION OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND THE LIBERAL JUDICIALIZZATION OF POLITICS, WHICH IS A CRITICAL ISSUE IN KOREAN POLITICS TODAY. THE FLOURISHING DISCUSSION ON REPUBLICANISM IN KOREAN SOCIETY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THE SUPERIORITY OF POLITICS AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE STAGE OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT IN THE STATE-CENTERED KOREAN SOCIETY, THE EMPHASIS ON REPUBLICAN VIRTUES CAN INCLUDE TOTALITARIANISM AND DISTORT REALITY DUE TO THE ABSTRACTION OF THE DEBATE. CONSEQUENTLY, ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE POLITICAL SUPERIORITY SHOULD BE HANDLED MORE CAREFULLY, AND EMPHASIS ON LIBERAL DEPOLITICIZATION SHOULD COME PRIOR TO IT. THE AUTHOR STRESSES THE LIMITATIONS OF REPUBLICANISM IN THE ONGOING MULTICULTURAL TREND IN KOREAN SOCIETY, AND SUPPORTS CONSENSUAL DEMOCRACY AS A PROPER SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION IN THIS PLURALISTIC WORLD. ALTHOUGH REINVIGORATED POLITICS IS VITAL FOR CONSENSUAL DEMOCRACY, THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY STILL REMAINS CRUCIAL FOR PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES.
277	THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY IS CORRELATED ACROSS COUNTRIES WITH MEASURES OF (LACK OF) CORRUPTION, BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE DUE TO A COMMON ASSOCIATION OF THESE VARIABLES WITH MEASURES OF CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE. HERE MEASURED BY A COMBINATION OF GOVERNANCE INDEXES LABELLED 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS'. NEW INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THE SIZE- AND SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTIONS OF CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WERE CONSTRUCTED IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRODUCTIVITY. CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCOUNTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF THE GLOBAL VARIATION IN OUTPUT PER WORKER ACROSS COUNTRIES. WITHIN THIS EMPIRICAL PATTERN THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC DEVIATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT AND FORMER SOCIALIST STATES, WHICH HAVE BOTH LOWER PRODUCTIVITY AND INFERIOR CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE THAN WOULD BE PREDICTED FOR OTHERWISE SIMILAR NON-SOCIALIST STATES. HOWEVER, FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF THE INDEX OF CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE THESE STATES ARE ALSO SHOWN TO HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF PRODUCTIVITY THAN OTHERWISE SIMILAR NON-SOCIALIST STATES. THE UNCONDITIONALLY LOW PRODUCTIVITY OF SOCIALIST STATES IS ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO THE INDIRECTLY DELETERIOUS EFFECTS THAT SOCIALISM HAD ON CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET ITS DIRECTLY POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUTPUT.
278	WESTERN LEGAL PREHISTORY AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT SOME OF THE EARLIEST PROTO-LEGAL AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT GAVE RISE TO WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE RULE OF LAW. SO CONSTRUED, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WESTERN LEGAL PREHISTORY IS CURRENTLY HIGHLY UNDEVELOPED. ONE REASON FOR THIS FACT IS METHODOLOGICAL: WITHOUT THE AID OF WRITTEN SOURCES, RECONSTRUCTIONS OF HUMAN PREHISTORY CAN PROVE DIFFICULT. RECENT ADVANCES IN A BROAD RANGE OF COGNATE FIELDS HAVE, HOWEVER, NOW ACCUMULATED PAST A CRITICAL TIPPING POINT, AND WE ARE NOW IN A SECURE ENOUGH POSITION TO BEGIN TO RECONSTRUCT IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF WESTERN LEGAL PREHISTORY. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS UPON AND DEVELOPS THESE CONTEMPORARY FINDINGS TO RECONSTRUCT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE GENEALOGICAL SHAPE OF WESTERN LEGAL PREHISTORY. IN THE PROCESS, IT REACHES A SOMEWHAT SURPRISING CONCLUSION. ON THE TRADITIONAL VIEW, THE MOST IMPORTANT TRADITIONS RELEVANT TO THE RISE OF WESTERN LAW AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION ARE SAID TO HAVE ORIGINATED IN ANCIENT GREECE, ROME, AND ISRAEL. THIS TRADITIONAL VIEW IS, HOWEVER, BASED PRIMARILY ON HISTORICAL SOURCES, AND THE RECONSTRUCTIONS IN THIS ARTICLE SUGGEST THAT IMPORTANT PRECURSORS OF THESE TRADITIONS VERY LIKELY EMERGED MUCH EARLIER AND MUCH FURTHER TO THE EAST. IN FACT, SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRADITIONS RELEVANT TO THE EMERGENCE OF LARGE-SCALE CIVILIZATIONS WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WEST WOULD APPEAR TO REPRESENT JUST ONE BRANCH A MUCH LARGER AND RICHER FAMILY OF TRADITIONS, WHICH BEGAN TO EMERGE AROUND 4500 BC IN THE EASTERN-IRAN-BACTRIA-INDUS-VALLEY REGION. BEGINNING AT THIS EARLY TIME, THIS REGION BEGAN TO PRODUCE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS TO ARISE WITHIN OUR NATURAL HISTORY AS A SPECIES (VIZ., THE "HARAPPAN" OR "INDUS VALLEY" CIVILIZATION), AND THE PEOPLE IN THIS REGION MUST HAVE THEREFORE DEVELOPED SOME OF THE VERY FIRST CULTURAL TRADITIONS THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY ADAPTED TO SUSTAINING LARGE-SCALE CIVILIZATIONS WITH INCIPIENT LAW. I WILL BE ARGUING THAT THESE ANCIENT DEVELOPMENTS MOST LIKELY HAD A MUCH CLOSER AND MUCH MORE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP TO SOME OF THE EARLIEST PRECURSORS OF WESTERN TRADITION THAN HAS COMMONLY BEEN RECOGNIZED BECAUSE THESE PRECURSORS OF WESTERN TRADITION ULTIMATELY ORIGINATED CLOSER TO ANCIENT BACTRIA-WHICH IS AN AREA DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE INDUS VALLEY-DURING THIS VERY SAME TIME PERIOD. THE RECONSTRUCTIONS DEVELOPED IN THIS ARTICLE WILL THUS ALLOW ME TO DECIPHER WHAT I TAKE TO BE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EARLY GENEALOGICAL SHAPE OF OUR LEGAL FAMILY TREE, AND TO SUGGEST A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BUT UNDERAPPRECIATED RELATIONSHIPS THAT OBTAIN BETWEEN OUR MODERN WESTERN TRADITIONS AND A RANGE OF OTHER EURASIAN TRADITIONS WITH WHICH THE WEST HAS TYPICALLY BEEN CONTRASTED. IN TODAY'S WORLD, IT IS, MOREOVER, ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO RECONSTRUCT THE GENEALOGICAL STRUCTURE OF WESTERN LEGAL PREHISTORY AND OBTAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR DEEP PAST. THERE IS NOW AN ACCUMULATING BODY OF EMPIRICAL WORK, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN A BROAD RANGE OF FEATURES OF MODERN SOCIETIES IN TERMS OF THE ORIGINS OF THEIR LAWS. THIS LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT LEGAL ORIGIN VARIABLES CAN HAVE STRONG EFFECTS ON ISSUES AS DIVERSE AS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, LABOR REGULATIONS, THE ROBUSTNESS OF CAPITAL MARKETS, AND EVEN LITERACY AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES. WHETHER AND HOW A MODERN SOCIETY FUNCTIONS BEST WOULD THUS APPEAR TO DEPEND AT LEAST IN PART ON THE ORIGINS OF THEIR LEGAL TRADITIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, BOTH THE PRESENT LEGAL ORIGINS LITERATURE AND MUCH COMPARATIVE LAW SCHOLARSHIP DISTINGUISH PRIMARILY BETWEEN THE CIVIL- VERSUS COMMON-LAW ORIGINS OF A NATION'S LEGAL SYSTEM, OR BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE TYPES OF WESTERN LAW AND VARIOUS NON-WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS; AND THE FINDINGS OF THIS LITERATURE HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY HARMONIZED WITH THE SWATH OF KNOWN DIFFICULTIES THAT MANY DEVELOPING NATIONS HAVE FACED IN TRANSITIONING TO LARGE-SCALE SOCIETIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW REGARDLESS OF THEIR CIVIL- OR COMMON-LAW ORIGINS. THE FAMILY TREES THAT ARE EMPLOYED IN THE CURRENT LITERATURE ARE, MOREOVER, TYPICALLY IDENTIFIED FROM THE HISTORICAL RECORD AND THEREFORE FAIL TO DETECT ANY RELEVANT RELATIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE ARISEN IN HUMAN PREHISTORY. THEY TEND TO FOCUS ON A CONCEPTION OF LAW AS A SET OF PUBLICLY STATED RULES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE LARGELY EXOGENOUS TO THE UNDERLYING CULTURAL TRADITIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES THAT TEND TO SUPPORT FLOURISHING LEGAL SYSTEMS. THEY THEREFORE FAIL TO DETECT THE KINDS OF EMERGENT CULTURAL TRADITIONS (INCLUDING THE CULTURALLY EMERGENT PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES) THAT FIRST ALLOWED HUMANS TO TRANSITION FROM HUNTER-GATHERER FORMS OF LIFE INTO LARGER-SCALE CIVILIZATIONS WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE RECONSTRUCTION OFFERED HERE WILL, BY CONTRAST, ALLOW US TO SEE ALMOST HALF OF THE LARGE-SCALE MEGAEMPIRES THAT HAVE ARISEN THROUGHOUT WORLD HISTORY-INCLUDING ALL THOSE THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE MODERN WEST-AS HAVING A SHARED CULTURAL ORIGIN THAT GOES MUCH FURTHER BACK IN TIME. THE TRADITION IN QUESTION FIRST EMERGED WITH SOME OF OUR VERY FIRST HUMAN FORAYS OUT OF HUNTER-GATHERER LIVING AND INTO SETTLED AGRICULTURAL LIVING WITH LARGE-SCALE CIVILIZATIONS AND INCIPIENT LEGAL TRADITIONS. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DEEPER FAMILY TREE SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE IMPORTANT EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS. THIS WORK CAN, FOR EXAMPLE, BE USED TO HELP EXPLAIN WHY CERTAIN EXPORTATIONS OF WESTERN-STYLE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE WORKED SO WELL WHILE OTHERS HAVE NOT. THIS WORK CAN ALSO BE USED TO IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT BUT UNDERAPPRECIATED FEATURES OF WESTERN TRADITIONS THAT ARE SHARED WITH THESE BROADER EURASIAN. TRADITIONS AND HAVE BEEN PLAYING A CRITICAL-IF UNDERAPPRECIATED-ROLE IN HELPING TO SUSTAIN VARIOUS FORMS OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OVER THE COURSE OF WORLD HISTORY. HENCE, THIS WORK CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND BETTER SOME OF THE FULL CAUSES AND CONDITIONS OF OUR MODERN SUCCESS IN THE WEST. INQUIRIES OF THIS KIND SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL URGENCY TODAY, GIVEN THE MASSIVE EXPORTATIONS OF WESTERN LAW AND WESTERN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO SO MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND GIVEN THE INCREASED PRESSURES TOWARD WESTERNIZATION THAT ARE BEING FELT AROUND THE GLOBE.
279	SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES ARE FORMED THROUGH BENCHMARKING AND ESTABLISHING PIONEERS, AND POLICY DIFFUSION IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP AND PROGRESSIVE PROMOTION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL POLICY DEPLOYMENT OF RURAL GOVERNANCE. IN ADDITION TO COMBINING THE TWO BENEFITS OF RURAL SOCIAL PROMOTION AND NATIONAL POLICY SUPPORT, THIS ALSO CREATES AN INTERACTIVE PATHWAY BETWEEN NATIONAL POLICY PROMOTION AND RURAL ACTIVE RESPONSE. WE SHOULD NOT ONLY CONCENTRATE ON THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM BUT ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PECULIARITIES OF PRIMARY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE IN ORDER TO STUDY THE WORKINGS OF EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP. THE NATIONAL RURAL GOVERNANCE LEADING CASES HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENSIVE SCOPE, WIDE RANGE OF MANIFESTATIONS, AND UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA'S WAVE OF RURAL GOVERNANCE REFORM EFFORTS IN THE NEW ERA. THE COMBINATION OF FEELING THE STONES TO CROSS THE RIVER AND STRENGTHENING TOP-LEVEL DESIGN BETTER REFLECTS THE LOGIC OF EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP IN CONTEMPORARY RURAL GOVERNANCE. THESE TWO STRATEGIES ARE BASED ON THE FIVE PRACTICAL DIMENSIONS OF PARTY-BUILDING LEADERSHIP, DEPARTMENTAL COORDINATION, INTEGRATION OF SELF-GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND RULE OF VIRTUE, CREATION OF NEW APPROACHES, AND MULTI-STAKEHOLDER GOVERNANCE.
280	GEOPOLITICAL RISK (GPR) AND OTHER SOCIAL INDICATORS HAVE RAISED MANY SOMBER ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED ISSUES AMONG GOVERNMENT ENVIRONMENTALISTS, AND POLICY ANALYSTS. TO FURTHER ELUCIDATE WHETHER OR NOT THESE INDICATORS INFLUENCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF GPR, CORRUPTION, AND GOVERNANCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION PROXIES BY CARBON EMISSIONS (CO2) IN BRICS (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA, AND SOUTH AFRICA) COUNTRIES, NAMELY BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA, AND SOUTH AFRICA, USING DATA OVER THE PERIOD 1990 TO 2018. THE CROSS-SECTIONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (CS-ARDL), FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (FMOLS), AND DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (DOLS) METHODS ARE USED FOR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS. FIRST AND SECOND-GENERATION PANEL UNIT ROOT TESTS REPORT A MIXED ORDER OF INTEGRATION. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI), AND INNOVATION HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CO2 EMISSIONS. IN CONTRAST, GEOPOLITICAL RISK, CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON CO2 EMISSIONS. BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL OUTCOMES, THE PRESENT RESEARCH INVITES THE CONCENTRATION OF CENTRAL AUTHORITIES AND POLICYMAKERS OF THESE ECONOMIES TOWARD REDESIGNING MORE SOPHISTICATED STRATEGIES REGARDING THESE POTENTIAL VARIABLES TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.
281	PURPOSETHE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED THE STATUS OF GLOBALIZATION OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS (PR) AGENCY INDUSTRY AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BY ANALYZING 101 COUNTRIES.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHDATA WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM CONTENT ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE ARCHIVAL SOURCES. CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS WERE USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS.FINDINGSTHE PRESENT STUDY IDENTIFIED THE FOUR DISTINCTIVE GROUPS OF COUNTRIES IN THE NUMBER OF GLOBAL PR AGENCIES PER COUNTRY. THESE GROUPS ARE (1) GLOBALIZED TOP COUNTRIES, (2) GLOBALIZED MAJOR COUNTRIES, (3) GLOBALIZING COUNTRIES AND (4) PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES. THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE DEGREE OF GLOBALIZATION OF THE PR AGENCY INDUSTRY IN A COUNTRY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC SYSTEM (GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOW), LEGAL SYSTEM (RULE OF LAW), CULTURAL SYSTEM (POWER DISTANCE AND LONG-TERM ORIENTATION) AND MEDIA SYSTEM (INTERNET PENETRATION RATE) FACTORS.ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE GLOBAL PR AGENCY INDUSTRY WAS LIMITED TO INVESTIGATING A FEW LEADING AGENCIES, BUT THIS STUDY ANALYZED 114 GLOBAL PR AGENCIES AND THEIR DIFFUSION IN 101 COUNTRIES AND EXPLORED THE INFLUENCE OF EACH COUNTRY'S CHARACTERISTICS (I.E. POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, CULTURAL AND MEDIA FACTORS) IDENTIFIED AS THE GLOBAL PR ENVIRONMENT FACTORS.
282	AUSTRALIAN FAIR TRIAL SCHOLARSHIP TENDS TO FOCUS ON COMMON LAW OR STATUTORY RIGHTS, OR INDETERMINATE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, FAIR TRIAL PRINCIPLES ORIGINALLY DERIVE FROM THE INHERENT JURISDICTION OF COMMON LAW COURTS. THERE MAY BE A HISTORIC LINK BETWEEN THE INHERENT JURISDICTION OF COURTS AND FAIR JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, BUT DOES THIS MYSTERIOUS CLASS OF JURISDICTION PRESENT A VALUABLE SOURCE OF FAIR TRIAL PROTECTION TODAY? THIS ARTICLE UNDERTAKES AN ORIGINAL EXAMINATION OF THE PROTECTION OF THE FAIR TRIAL IN AUSTRALIAN COURTS BY OPERATION OF THE INHERENT JURISDICTION. IT ENGAGES WITH THE UNDER-THEORISED NOTION OF THE INHERENT JURISDICTION IN AUSTRALIA AND CONSIDERS ITS PLACE IN THE COMPLEX WEB OF STATUTORY, COMMON LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL FAIR TRIAL PROTECTIONS. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE ARTICLE ENGAGES A CASE STUDY ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF THE INHERENT JURISDICTION IN MATTERS CONCERNING SECRET EVIDENCE AND SEVERE PRISON CONDITIONS. THE INHERENT JURISDICTION EMERGES AS A POWERFUL TOOL IN THE PROTECTION OF FAIR TRIAL RIGHTS AND PRINCIPLES: COMPLEMENTING, BOLSTERING AND ALIGNING WITH OTHER PROTECTIONS. HOWEVER, WITHOUT A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ITS NATURE AND SCOPE IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT, THE INHERENT JURISDICTION MAY RISK THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND RULE OF LAW.
283	LOCAL ELECTIONS ARE ELECTIONS OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ESTABLISHED ON THE BASIS OF EXERCISE OF THE UNIVERSAL RIGHT TO VOTE. THE RIGHT TO VOTE AS A FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL RIGHT MUST BE PROVIDED WITH RELEVANT LEGAL PROTECTION. APPLICABLE TO BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS, VOTERS' CONFIDENCE IN FAIRNESS OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AND AUTHENTICITY OF ELECTION RESULTS ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THE LEGITIMACY OF ELECTIONS. A COMMON REQUIREMENT FOR ELECTORAL DISPUTE SYSTEM IN COUNTRIES, ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW, IS THAT IS SUPPORTS CREDIBILITY OF THE ELECTION PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS INTO THE LEGAL NATURE OF LOCAL ELECTORAL DISPUTES IN THE REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA AND INVESTIGATES WHETHER LOCAL ELECTORAL DISPUTES ARE IN THEIR LEGAL NATURE CONSTITUTIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE OR SUI GENERIS COURT DISPUTES. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LOCAL ELECTORAL DISPUTES ARE ANALYSED ON THE BASIS OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: LOGICAL (ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION, DEDUCTION), HISTORICAL, SYSTEMIC, AND FORMALLY DOGMATIC. THE AUTHOR ESTABLISHES THE HYPOTHESIS OF NOT ONE, BUT MULTIPLE FORMS OF LOCAL ELECTORAL DISPUTE, ALL OF WHICH DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY, THEIR LEGAL NATURE BEING ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT AS WELL. THE ARTICLE ALSO, IN THIS REGARD, CONSIDERS CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SLOVENIAN LEGAL ARRANGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL FORMS OF LOCAL ELECTORAL DISPUTE.
284	THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES OUR SPECIAL ISSUE BY POSING A CENTRAL QUESTION: WHAT IS THE ADDED VALUE OF THE INCREASING PROMINENCE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE "ESSENCE" OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN EU LAW? IT WILL ADDRESS THIS LARGER QUESTION IN FOUR STEPS: FIRST, BY EXAMINING THE FUNCTION OF THE CONCEPT IN EU LAW AND THE METHODS FOR ITS DERIVATION; SECOND, BY SUMMARIZING HOW ITS APPLICATION DIVERGES ACROSS EU-AND INTERNATIONAL-LAW; THIRD, BY OUTLINING SOME ENDURING DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ESSENCE CONCEPT; AND FINALLY, BY REFLECTING ON ITS FUTURE ROLE IN EU LAW, INCLUDING ITS IMPACT ON OTHER SITES OF LEGAL AUTHORITY-SUCH AS DOMESTIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE EU, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. AS THE OTHER ARTICLES OF THIS ISSUE DEMONSTRATE, WHILE THERE IS NOT YET A COHERENT APPROACH TO DERIVING AND UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF RIGHTS ACROSS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THE EU MUST PROTECTS, THE ESSENCE CONCEPT PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DEMARCATING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE EU'S LEGAL AND POLITICAL ORDERS AND BETWEEN OVERLAPPING SITES OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS-SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW "CRISES"-ARE LIKELY TO FURTHER AMPLIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF "ESSENCE" TO EU LAW PRACTICE AND SCHOLARSHIP.
285	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS WHETHER THERE IS A THUCYDIDES TRAP IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, REFERRING TO THE INHERENT CONFLICT BETWEEN INCUMBENT AND CHALLENGER. IT ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ALIENATION OF TRADITIONAL US ALLIES, WHICH THREATENS TO SPLINTER THE HEGEMONIC COALITION AND EVEN PUSH CHINA AND EUROPE TOGETHER, AND HIS CONVERGENCE TOWARD SOME CHINESE NORMS ON TRADE AND EVEN POLITICS. IT OUTLINES THREE POSSIBLE SYSTEMIC SCENARIOS: A G0 IN WHICH THE US IS NO LONGER WILLING TO LEAD BUT CHINA IS NOT YET ABLE OR WILLING, AND WHETHER SUCH A (LIKELY) REGIME WILL BE STABLE OR UNSTABLE; A NEW G1, SOONER OR LATER, LED BY CHINA; AND A COOPERATIVE G2 IN WHICH THE US AND CHINA AGREE TO SHARE LEADERSHIP. IT TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF ACTUAL LEADERSHIP INITIATIVES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES IN RECENT YEARS. IT COMPARES US AND CHINESE ATTITUDES ON KEY SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND CONCLUDES WITH AN APPRAISAL OF AN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, A WORLD IN WHICH THE STATE PLAYS A GREATER ROLE RELATIVE TO MARKET ECONOMICS, THE RULE OF LAW DEFERS INCREASINGLY TO VOLUNTARY ARRANGEMENTS, AND POLITICS TILT TOWARD CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL MORE THAN DEMOCRACY.
286	THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1988 IS ESSENTIAL MILESTONE IN THE GUARANTEE OF RIGHTS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTS LISTED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT, ALSO SERVING AS THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT NEED TO CARRY OUT THE PLANNED RIGHTS, THE JUDICIARY ENDS UP BECOMING ONE OF THE VECTORS FOR BOTH AND SOMETIMES JUST EXTRAPOLATING THE LIMITS THAT COULD BE REVEALED. HEREIN LIES THE PRESENT DISCUSSION, NAMELY, THE PROBLEM OF RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AHEAD TO JUDICIAL ACTIVISM. TO DEVELOP THE STUDY IS USED THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. INITIALLY IT PRESENTS A HISTORICAL APPROACH ON DEMOCRACY AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION. FOLLOWING BUILDS A CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF THE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND THE FACTORS THAT INVOLVE THROWING YOURSELF THE QUESTION: "HOW TO ESTABLISH CONTROLS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW AND PREVENT JUDGES TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DEMOCRATICALLY CONSTRUCTED LEGISLATION?". TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM PROPOSED, USES THE ANALYSIS THEORY HERMENEUTICS LAW REVIEW, PRODUCED BY LENIO STRECK, BEING ABLE TO FINALLY CONCLUDE THAT ARISES AS A NEW PARADIGM IN THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW, RESPECTING DEMOCRACY AND SHOWING OVERCOMING OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, PARTICULARLY BY BUILDING AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO THE CONSTITUTION.
287	DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO FRAGILE STATES AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED AREAS CAN BE A CORE COMPONENT OF PEACEBUILDING, PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THE RESTORATION OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, DELIVERY OF BASIC SERVICES, THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION. DESPITE A WEALTH OF RESEARCH, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT GAPS REMAIN IN OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT HAS WORKED, WHY AND THE TRANSFERABILITY AND SCALABILITY OF FINDINGS. THE PROJECT PRESENTED IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OFFERS NEW RESEARCH ON SUCCESSFUL' PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMES IN DIVERSE DOMAINS AND CONTEXTS IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE SPECIAL ISSUE AND EIGHT CASE STUDIES INCLUDED IN THIS VOLUME. THREE BROAD FACTORS ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS SIGNIFICANT IN UNDERSTANDING WHY SOME INTERVENTIONS WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS: THE AREA OF INTERVENTION AND THE RELATED DEGREE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE INSTITUTIONS; LOCAL CONTEXTUAL FACTORS SUCH AS CAPACITY AND THE EXISTENCE OF LOCAL SUPPORTERS; AND PROGRAMME DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH DISCUSSION OF HOW THESE CASE STUDIES AND SIMILAR RESEARCH CAN SPEAK TO BROADER DEBATES IN THE LITERATURE ON HOW PEACE IS BUILT, AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EXTERNAL ACTORS AND ENDOGENOUS PROCESSES.
288	THE DIFFICULTIES IN NEGOTIATING A POST-2012 REGIME OF BINDING TARGETS AND TIMETABLES AND THE DECISIONS OF THE US, CANADA, AND RUSSIA ON THE KYOTO PROTOCOL REGIME HAVE LED TO PESSIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE CLIMATE REGIME. NEGOTIATION ISSUES FOR DIFFERENT COALITIONS AND ACTORS ARE PLACED IN A WIDER HISTORICAL CONTEXT BY EXAMINING THE KEY CHALLENGE FACING THE EVOLVING LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE NEGOTIATION PROCESS: THE PRINCIPLED BASIS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES, RESPONSIBILITIES, RIGHTS, AND RISKS BETWEEN ACTORS. FOUR THEORETICAL APPROACHES (PROBLEM STRUCTURING; NEGOTIATION THEORY; COLLECTIVE ACTION AND SOCIAL PRACTICE MODELS; LEGAL THEORY) ARE APPLIED TO THE CLIMATE REGIME. A PRINCIPLED APPROACH IS ONLY A DISTRIBUTIVE APPROACH FROM A NARROW SHORT-TERM PERSPECTIVE. IT BECOMES AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH FROM A LONGER-TERM PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT INCREASES THE PIE, ENHANCES THE WIN-WIN OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATES SPACE FOR SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS TO EMERGE. IT IS ESPECIALLY INTEGRATIVE WHEN UNDERTAKEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS ABLE TO CREATE PREDICTABLE RULES THAT APPLY TO FUTURE GLOBAL PROBLEMS WITH DIFFERENT COUNTRY INTERESTS. WILL THIS HAPPEN? CLIMATE JUSTICE MOVEMENTS AND CLIMATE LITIGATION HAVE BEGUN; STATESMANSHIP IS STILL NEEDED.
289	HOW DO FORMAL CONSTITUTIONS IMPACT THE PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRATIZATION IN HYBRID REGIMES, WHERE CORRUPTION IS TYPICALLY HIGH AND RULE OF LAW WEAK? IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED EITHER THAT THEY SET "RULES OF THE GAME," HAVING EFFECTS BY BEING FOLLOWED, OR THAT THEY DO NOT MATTER, BEING OVERWHELMED BY INFORMAL POLITICS. IN FACT, A LOGIC OF COLLECTIVE ACTION REVEALS THAT CONSTITUTIONS DO MATTER, BUT AS MUCH BY SHAPING INFORMAL POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS AS BY BEING OBEYED. PRESIDENTIALIST CONSTITUTIONS, THROUGH AN INFORMATION EFFECT AND A FOCAL EFFECT, GENERATE EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE INFORMAL POWER THAT ENCOURAGE CLIENTELISTIC NETWORKS TO COORDINATE LAW-DISREGARDING PRACTICES AROUND A "SINGLE PYRAMID" OF POWER LED BY THE PRESIDENT. THE INFORMATION AND FOCAL EFFECTS OF DIVIDED-EXECUTIVE CONSTITUTIONS, BY CONTRAST, CREATE EXPECTATIONS THAT COMPLICATE THE COORDINATION OF CLIENTELISTIC NETWORKS AROUND A SINGLE PATRON, PROMOTING "COMPETING-PYRAMID" POLITICS. TO ISOLATE THE IMPACT OF FORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND RULE OUT OTHER CAUSES, A TIGHTLY CONTROLLED PROCESS-TRACING PAIRED COMPARISON IS EMPLOYED USING UKRAINE AND KYRGYZSTAN DURING 2005-10, EXPLAINING WHY UKRAINE'S ORANGE REVOLUTION PRODUCED A TRUE DEMOCRATIC OPENING (EVEN IF SHORT LIVED) WHILE KYRGYZSTAN'S TULIP REVOLUTION DID NOT.
290	ACCORDING TO THE CONVENTIONAL VIEW COMPETITION LAW DIFFERS FROM REGULATION IN THAT IT IS APPLIED EX POST, THROUGH PROSCRIPTIONS, AND IN A 'CRIME-TORT' FASHION. FROM THIS ANGLE, WHEN COMPETITION ENFORCERS INTERVENE EX ANTE, IN A PROPHYLACTIC MANNER, AND EMPLOY PRESCRIPTIVE TOOLS, THEY INAPPROPRIATELY TRANSFORM COMPETITION LAW INTO 'REGULATORY ANTITRUST'. THE PRESENT STUDY CHALLENGES THIS VIEW ARGUING THAT MODERN COMPETITION LAW INTERVENTION HAS MOVED BEYOND THE CRIME -TORT ENFORCEMENT MODEL AND ASPIRES TO BE 'RESPONSIVE'. THIS MEANS THAT MODERN ENFORCERS INTERVENE EX ANTE AND EX POST, USE PRESCRIPTIVE AND PROSCRIPTIVE TOOLS, AND IMPOSE RESTORATIVE AND PROPHYLACTIC REMEDIES TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW IS APPLIED EFFECTIVELY. THE WORKS OF THE GREEK COMPETITION AUTHORITY OFFER A CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT. THIS AUTHORITY HAS BEEN UTILIZING A PLURALITY OF TOOLS AND ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE COMPLIANCE AND DETERRENCE, AND APPLY THE LAW RESPONSIVELY. HOWEVER, ENFORCEMENT THAT ASPIRES TO BE RESPONSIVE MAY CREATE PROBLEMS OF OVER-ENFORCEMENT OR UNDER-ENFORCEMENT, BE VULNERABLE TO REGULATORY FAILURES OR UNDERMINE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES. FOR THIS REASON, THIS STUDY DRAWS ON RESPONSIVE REGULATION THEORY TO MAKE FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND ENSURE TRULY RESPONSIVE ENFORCEMENT.
291	LEVERAGING E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT TO IMPROVE ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE HAS BECOME A SHARED VISION OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE. HOWEVER, THE INTERNAL MECHANISM FOR E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT TO PROMOTE GOVERNANCE IS AMBIGUOUS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH E-GOVERNMENT AFFECTS GOVERNANCE REMAINS UNCERTAIN. DRAWING ON PUBLIC VALUE THEORY, THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE INTERNAL MECHANISM BEHIND GLOBAL E-GOVERNMENT PROMOTING GOVERNANCE IMPROVEMENT. TO DETERMINE THE REALISTIC EFFECTS OF E-GOVERNMENT IN GOVERNANCE IMPROVEMENT, EMPIRICAL TEST INCLUDED 170 COUNTRIES AND COVERED OBSERVATIONS FROM 2010 TO 2018. RESULTS OF THE LINEAR PANEL DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF E-GOVERNMENT PROMOTED GOVERNANCE IMPROVEMENT AS A WHOLE. SPECIFICALLY, THE EFFECTS OF E-GOVERNMENT ON DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE WERE HETEROGENEOUS: E-GOVERNMENT PERFORMS STRONG POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE FOUR GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW, BUT RELATIVELY WEAK EFFECTS ON POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THESE RESULTS INDICATE A CERTAIN GAP REMAINS BETWEEN THE VISION AND THE REALITY OF USING E-GOVERNMENT TO COMPREHENSIVELY IMPROVE GOVERNANCE. THIS STUDY PROVIDED INSIGHTS INTO THE FUTURE TRENDS AND PRIORITIES OF GLOBAL E-GOVERNMENT.
292	THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF PERU IS BASED ON DOCTRINAL CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION, RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, RULES AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES. THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS THE HIGHEST INTERPRETER OF THE CONSTITUTION, GUARANTOR OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY, AND CUSTODY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MAGNA CARTA; HOWEVER, DEBATES HAVE ARISEN RE-GARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE, ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION, AND THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRO-PORTIONALITY THROUGH THE LEGAL MECHANISM OF THE WEIGHTING TEST. THE PRESENT WORK HAS THE OBJECTIVE OF ANALYZING THE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND PRINCIPLES, (ESPECIALLY THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY), FREQUENTLY USED TO SETTLE CONFLICTS AND SOLVE CONTROVERSIES OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, BASED ON THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THIS COURT, THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION OF QUALITATIVE, DES-CRIPTIVE DESIGN AND THE USE OF VARIOUS METHODS TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIPS, AND ESSENTIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL DOCTRINE AND THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. AS A RESULT, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY CONSTITUTES A CONTROL MECHANISM, AND THAT THE WEIGHTING TEST IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE INTERPRETATION, THE EVALUATION OF SPECIFIC CASES AND THE ARGUMENTATION OF THE CORRESPONDING SENTENCES.
293	JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF COURTS' DECISIONS WHEN JUDGES HAVE NO ELECTORAL MANDATE. YET, IN AUSTRALIA, WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURTS IN THE EYES OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY. DRAWING ON A SURVEY OF A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF AUSTRALIAN ADULTS, WE ADDRESS THE QUESTION: WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF LEGITIMACY OF, OR DIFFUSE SUPPORT FOR, THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA AMONG THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC, AND WHAT FACTORS ARE CORRELATED WITH THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT? OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY IN AUSTRALIA IS MAINLY DEPENDENT UPON PEOPLE'S COMMITMENT TO STRUCTURAL DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES REGARDING THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, WE FIND THAT AUSTRALIANS' LOYALTY TO THE HIGH COURT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, TO IDEAS OF TOLERANCE OR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. INSTEAD, DIFFUSE SUPPORT FOR THE HIGH COURT IS BASED, PRIMARILY, ON PEOPLE'S LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MORE BROADLY, ON THEIR LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE MULTI-PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM.
294	DUE TO OCCUPATION, REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR, SLOVENIA LOST 6.5 % OF ITS POPULATION BETWEEN 1941 AND 1945, 2 % BEING VICTIMS OF FRATRICIDE. FROM 1941 UP TO 1990, ON ITS WAY TO POWER AND, WHILE IN POWER, TITOISM CAUSED MAJOR TRAUMATIZATIONS WITH LONGTERM CONSEQUENCES. AMONG A MILLION AND A HALF INHABITANTS, 23,000 PRISONERS OF WARS AND CIVILIANS WERE KILLED, OVER 110,000 WERE EXILED OR FLED, OVER 100,000 BECAME PRISONERS, INTERNEES, AND FORCED LABOURERS, 60,000 LOST THEIR PROPERTY BY CONFISCATION, OVER 100,000 PERSONS WERE PERSECUTED BY THE POLITICAL POLICE, PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND AGRICULTURE WERE DESTROYED, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE SUPPRESSED, RELIGIONS AND CHURCHES WERE PERSECUTED. HUMAN RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED ON A BIG SCALE AND FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ACHIEVE CHANGE IN THE SOCIETY, I.E. TO EMPATHISE WITH THE VICTIMS AND COMPENSATE THEM AND TO CONDEMN THE PERPETRATORS. BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL EXTENT OF THE TERROR AND ITS LONGTERM CONSEQUENCES. THEY SHOULD BE BASED ON INVESTIGATING THE VIOLATIONS OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND ON INNOVATIVE RESEARCH INCLUDING IMPROVED TERMINOLOGICAL, CHRONOLOGICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DEFINITIONS.
295	ACROSS THE AMERICAS, FROM NORTHERN MEXICO TO COLOMBIA'S MOUNTAIN VALLEYS AND BRAZIL'S SHANTYTOWNS, ESCALATING ARMED VIOLENCE AND THE GROWING POWER OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS HAS GENERATED IMMENSE PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE SOME POLICY MAKERS AND JOURNALISTS WRITE ABOUT STATE FAILURE AND THE EMERGENCE OF UNGOVERNED SPACES, THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE WILL SHOW THAT FAR FROM A LACK OF GOVERNANCE OR A FAILURE OF THE STATE, CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN COLLABORATE WITH A VARIETY OF STATE ACTORS TO CREATE VARIED SYSTEMS OF LOCALIZED ORDER THAT PERPETUATE CRIMINAL POWER AND UNDERMINE MOST POLICY EFFORTS TO CONTROL CRIME AND VIOLENCE. IN CONTRAST TO PAST SCHOLARSHIP'S RELIANCE ON SINGLE CASE STUDIES TO ANALYZE THE EFFORTS OF ARMED ACTORS TO BUILD LOCALIZED ORDERS, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A SYSTEMATIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF A POLICE-CONNECTED PROTECTION RACKET AND A DRUG GANG OPERATING IN TWO RIO DE JANEIRO NEIGHBORHOODS UNDER SIMILAR POLITICAL CONDITIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT VARIATION IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THE ARMED ACTORS AND, IN PARTICULAR, THEIR PROXIMITY TO STATE OFFICIALS, POSES VARIED CONSEQUENCES FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICS AND POLICYMAKING, ASSOCIATIONAL LIFE, AND VIOLENCE AND SECURITY.
296	OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND ENERGY TRANSPORT ARE INTIMATELY INTERTWINED WITH AZERBAIJAN'S HISTORY. EXPLOITING NATURAL ENERGY RESOURCES AND ACHIEVING SUCCESS IN THE REGIONAL PIPELINE STRATEGY ARE KEY PARTS OF AZERBAIJAN'S FOREIGN POLICY. THIS WILL BE EVEN MORE VISIBLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS AZERBAIJAN HAS BECOME PIVOTAL TO THE ENERGY SECURITY OF EUROPE AND A CRUCIAL HUB IN THE 'GREAT PIPELINE POLICY GAME'. 'ENERGY SECURITY' IS INSEPARABLE FROM OPEN ACCESS TO NETWORKS AND FUNCTIONING MARKETS AND COMPRISES BOTH SECURITY OF SUPPLY (ENERGY IMPORTS) AND SECURITY OF SALES TO CONSUMERS (ENERGY EXPORTS). TWO SIMULTANEOUS LINES OF ACTION ARE PROPOSED IN THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION: FIRST, IN A BALANCED APPROACH THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) SHOULD RECALIBRATE ITS POLICY TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN CAUCASUS AND IN PARTICULAR HELP SOLVE THE NAGORNO-KARABACH CONFLICT, WHICH IS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO REGIONAL COOPERATION AND GROWTH. SECONDLY, AN EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY GOVERNANCE OF THE PIPELINE POLICY GAME IS NEEDED, IE, THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS THE NECESSARY COMPANION OF FUNCTIONING MARKETS SHOULD PREVAIL; IN THIS RESPECT AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY (ECT) AND A RENEWED LAUNCH OF THE 'BAKU INITIATIVE' WOULD BE HELPFUL.
297	OUR ANALYSIS SETS OUT TO EXPLAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL FREEDOMS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CHINESE DOMESTIC POLITICS AND FOREIGN POLICY. THE IMAGES OF CHINA AS A RISING MILITARY POWER WITH A GROWING ECONOMY HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE DEGREE TO WHICH DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND NORMS HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED IN CHINA. THE EXISTING LITERATURE HAS TYPICALLY FOCUSED ON AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION THAT HAS PLACED CHINA AMONG THE EMERGING POWERS OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. THE ISSUE OF CHINA'S SURGING POWER IS RIPE FOR MORE PROBING AND SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY CONTEXTUALIZES CHINA'S POLICY TOWARD DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON TIBET AND AFRICA, IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ITS RAMIFICATIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS THERE. WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE IS THAT CHINA'S DEVELOPMENTAL PATH, WHICH PRIVILEGES ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER POLITICAL FREEDOMS, IS LIKELY TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR STATES STRUGGLING IN THEIR TRANSITION TOWARD DEMOCRACY TO RELY ON AUTOCRATIC STYLES OF DEVELOPMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD INSIST THAT CHINESE LEADERS RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AND JUDICIAL REFORM. FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND ECONOMIC TRADEOFFS AND THEIR POLITICAL DYNAMICS WILL HAVE PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES.
298	DEMOCRATIC PEACE STUDIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY IDENTIFIED KANTIAN "REPUBLICANISM" WITH PROCEDURAL DEMOCRACY AND LARGELY IGNORED LIBERALISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH ARE EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTAL FOR KANT'S REASONING BEHIND THE LIBERAL PEACE. A CLOSER LOOK INTO HIS MAJOR POLITICAL WORKS REVEALS THAT PEACEFUL RELATIONS ARE EXPECTED FROM STATES WITH THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS (LIBERALISM), THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL EQUALITY (CONSTITUTIONALISM), AND REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT (DEMOCRACY). ONLY WHEN ALL THREE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS ARE JOINTLY CONSIDERED CAN WE UNCOVER THE MULTIFACETED NATURE OF KANT'S APPROACH TO THE DOMESTIC SOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE. IN THIS WAY, WE NOT ONLY FIND THAT MONADIC AND DYADIC EXPECTATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH KANT'S THEORY, BUT ALSO THAT BOTH NORMATIVE AND INTEREST-BASED EXPLANATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE CAN EQUALLY DRAW ON KANT AS THEIR THEORETICAL PRECURSOR. WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS PLAUSIBLE TO INFER THAT THE KANTIAN LEGACY IS RELATED TO CIVIL PEACE AS WELL. THE PROPOSITIONS WE DERIVE FROM OUR THEORETICAL REEXAMINATION OF THE KANTIAN LEGACY ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTED IN OUR QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL TEST. MOREOVER, CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERALISM, RATHER THAN DEMOCRACY, SHOWS TO BE BOTH MORE CENTRAL FOR KANT'S THEORY AND EMPIRICALLY MORE ROBUSTLY RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC PEACE.
299	CRITICS OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRAGMATISM, SUCH AS PROFESSOR FALLEN, ARGUE THAT COURTS SHOULD NOT DECIDE CONSTITUTIONAL CASES SIMPLY BY ASKING WHAT OUTCOME IS BEST, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. SUCH AN APPROACH, THE CRITICS CONTEND, DOES NOT PERMIT CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION TO ADVANCE VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THIS REPLY TO PROFESSOR FALLEN'S ARTICLE IN THIS ISSUE ARGUES THAT THE CRITICS ARE RIGHT TO REJECT PURE ADJUDICATORY INSTRUMENTALISM BUT THAT A DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF PRAGMATISM SHOULD INFORM CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICAN PHILOSOPHERS USED THE TERM PRAGMATISM TO MEAN UNDERSTANDING A PRACTICE BY PARTICIPATING IN IT RATHER THAN THEORIZING ABOUT IT. APPLIED TO CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, THIS NOTION OF PRAGMATISM-AS-CONTEXTUALISM MAKES INSTRUMENTALISM SAFE FOR INTERPRETATION, FOR IT ALLOWS INSTRUMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS TO BE WEIGHED WITHIN THE FELT-BUT-DIFFICULT-TO-DEFINE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE. IN ENDORSING CONSTITUTIONAL PRAGMATISM-AS-CONTEXTUALISM, THIS REPLY CHALLENGES PROFESSOR FALLEN'S SUGGESTION THAT JUDGES AND CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS SHOULD "CHOOSE" CONSTITUTIONAL THEORIES THAT THEY THEN USE TO RESOLVE CONCRETE DISPUTES. INSTEAD, THIS REPLY ARGUES THAT THEORIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION EMERGE FROM CONSIDERED, CONTEXTUAL JUDGMENTS ABOUT PARTICULAR CASES.
300	APART FROM THE CORPORATE TAX RATES, THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS (EDB) INDEX ACCOUNTS FOR THE CROSS-COUNTRY OR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE INFLOWS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AS ESTABLISHED IN THE LITERATURE. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY CONTENDS THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS ARE CRITICAL TO COMPLEMENT THE ROLE OF THE EDB IN ATTRACTING THE DESIRED FDI INTO AFRICA. FOR EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, THE STUDY PERFORMS GOVERNANCE INDICATORS-RELATED STEP-WISE SYSTEM-GMM ESTIMATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF CORPORATE TAX, UN-INTERACTED EDB, AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN EDB AND GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE NET INFLOWS OF FDI USING DATA FROM 2015 TO 2019 FOR 50 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE CORPORATE TAX RATE AND THE UN-INTERACTIVE EDB HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE INFLOWS OF FDI IN AFRICA IN THE SHORT- AND LONG RUNS. IN CONTRAST, GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS COMPLEMENT EDB TO EXERT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE INFLOWS OF FDI IN AFRICA, ALBEIT THE FINDINGS ARE NOT GENERALLY SIGNIFICANT. THUS, TO ATTRACT THE DESIRED FDI, THE STUDY INTER-ALIA CALLS FOR STRICT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ASSURANCE IN AFRICA.
301	PREVIOUS STUDIES PAY A LITTLE ATTENTION TO WHETHER THE DIFFERENCES IN NATIONAL GOVERNANCE QUALITY BETWEEN HOME AND HOST COUNTRY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT FOREIGN BANK PERFORMANCE. BASED ON A BANK PANEL DATA WITH 375 FOREIGN BANKS IN 47 ASIAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2004 AND 2019, THE IMPACT OF THE HOST-HOME COUNTRY DIFFERENCE IN GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON FOREIGN BANK PERFORMANCE IS EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATED BY CONSIDERING THE DEGREE OF BANKING COMPETITION MEASURED WITH THE BOONE INDEX. USING A PANEL DATA MODEL WITH MULTILEVEL MIXED-EFFECTS, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT FOREIGN BANKS IN ASIA PRESENT HIGHER PROFITS THAN DOMESTIC BANKS. SPECIFICALLY, BANKS LOCATING IN A LESS COMPETITIVE HOST NATION SHOW HIGHER PROFITABILITY, WHILE HOST-HOME DIFFERENCES IN AGGREGATED QUALITY OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FOREIGN BANK PROFITABILITY IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL INDICATOR FOR VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. FINALLY, FOREIGN BANKS COULD GAUGE THEIR MARKET POWER IN A LESS COMPETITIVE BANKING STRUCTURE IN THE HOST COUNTRY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE BETWEEN HOST AND HOME COUNTRY ON THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.
302	IN 2016, THE SPIRITUAL BASE OF BOKO HARAM, KNOWN AS 'CAMP ZERO' WAS CAPTURED. WITH SUCH SUCCESS, MOST HAD THOUGHT THAT THE CHICKEN HAS FINALLY COME HOME TO ROOST. UNFORTUNATELY, IT WAS NOT TO BE. BECAUSE ASIDE FROM BOKO HARAM, THE COUNTRY SEEMS TO EXPERIENCE OTHER VAGARIES OF INSECURITY. THIS RANGE FROM KIDNAPPING, CULT AND RITUAL GROUPS IN THE SOUTH-SUCH AS FEMALE PANT HUNTERS, BADOO-OIL BUNKERING AND PIPELINE VANDALISM, CATTLE RUSTLING AND HERDSMEN-FARMERS CRISES, AMONG OTHERS. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRACE THE HISTORY OF THE TERROR GROUP AND EXAMINE THE NUMEROUS INSECURITY CHALLENGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY DESPITE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS. THE STUDY REVEALED AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE PERPETUATION OF TERROR AND INSECURITY IN THE LAND IS A REFLECTION OF THE NATURE OF THE STATE ITSELF-A FAILING, WEAK STATE. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT UNTIL THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THE NATURE OF THE STATE ITSELF, THE INSECURITY WILL CONTINUE. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS SUGGESTED ARE ENTRENCHMENT OF GOOD LEADERSHIP, POLITICAL WILL, RULE OF LAW, GOOD GOVERNANCE, ERADICATION OF POVERTY AND ILLITERACY, AND INCLUSIVE POLICIES, AMONG OTHERS.
303	THE ENGAGEMENT OF CONSERVATIVE, POPULIST GOVERNMENTS WITH CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND CONSTITUTION-MAKING IS PERCEIVED AS A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. CONSTITUTIONALISTS OFTEN ASSUME A RELATION OF MUTUAL EXCLUSION BETWEEN POPULISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN CONTRAST, I ARGUE THAT WHILE POPULISM OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A REJECTION OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, IT EQUALLY CONSTITUTES A COMPETING POLITICAL FORCE REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE FIRST DISCUSSES POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TWO, MAIN MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS: THE MODERNIST AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ONES. SECOND, I DISCUSS THE POPULIST CRITIQUE OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, WITH A CENTRAL FOCUS ON THE RECENT CASES OF RIGHT-WING POPULISM IN POWER IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE. FOUR DIMENSIONS ARE PROMINENT: (I) POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AS THE KEY JUSTIFICATORY CLAIM OF POPULISM; (II) MAJORITY RULE AS THE MAIN POPULIST MODE OF GOVERNMENT; (III) INSTRUMENTALISM AS THE LEGAL-PRACTICAL APPROACH OF POPULISTS; AND (IV) LEGAL RESENTMENT AS THE POPULISTS' MAIN ATTITUDE TOWARD PUBLIC LAW. IN CONCLUSION, I ARGUE THAT WHILE THE POPULIST CRITIQUE OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INSIGHTS INTO STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM ULTIMATELY FAILS TO LIVE UP TO ITS OWN DEMOCRATIC PROMISE.
304	ALBERTO FUJIMORI IS THE FIRST DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADER TO BE TRIED AND CONVICTED OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE DOMESTIC COURTS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY. AS SATISFACTION WITH FOREGOING PROSECUTION AND GRANTING AMNESTY IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE PEACEFUL DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION HAS FALLEN INCREASINGLY OUT OF FAVOR, FUJIMORI'S TRIAL COMES AT AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO REEVALUATE THE ROLE OF CRIMINAL TRIALS IN NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. IN THIS NOTE, I ARGUE THAT FUJIMORI'S HUMAN RIGHTS TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THAT HEAD-OF-STATE TRIALS, PARTICULARLY DOMESTIC ONES, CAN VALUABLY CONTRIBUTE TO LARGER TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROJECTS, DESPITE THEIR INHERENT LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES. SITUATING MY ANALYSIS WITHIN THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND SHOW TRIAL LITERATURE, I ANALYZE BOTH PROCEDURALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY HOW EFFECTIVELY FUJIMORI'S HUMAN RIGHTS TRIAL HAS NAVIGATED ITS "CONSTITUTIVE PARADOX," OR TENSION BETWEEN STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE EXTRAJUDICIAL OBJECTIVE OF DELIVERING A COHERENT MORAL MESSAGE, INHERENT IN TRANSITIONAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. I CONCLUDE THAT THE TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THAT COURTS CAN EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATE THESE PARADOXES, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS AND SOCIETAL CLEAVAGES. MOREOVER, I SUGGEST THAT DOMESTIC TRIBUNALS MAY BE PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO NAVIGATE THE CONSTITUTIVE PARADOX OF TRANSITIONAL TRIALS.
305	THIS ESSAY IDENTIFIES A BLIND SPOT IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THEORY CONCERNING THE LEGITIMATE LEGAL AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ESSAY EXAMINES THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS BLIND SPOT, ARGUING THAT IT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A. V. DICEY'S CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY, WHICH ASSERTS THAT THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION RESTS UPON THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. DICEY ARGUED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WAS PRECLUDED BY THE NATURE OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION, BECAUSE IT ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO EITHER PARLIAMENT OR THE COMMON LAW COURTS. THE ESSAY CRITICIZES DICEY'S ARGUMENT ON TWO SEPARATE GROUNDS. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT DICEY'S THEORY WAS EMPIRICALLY MISTAKEN, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR COMMON CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES WHEREBY LEGAL AUTHORITY IS DELEGATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS. SECOND, IT ARGUES THAT ONE CAN GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DICEY'S THEORY IF IT IS RECAST AS A CONTESTABLE POLITICAL STATEMENT REGARDING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. BY ENGAGING WITH DICEY'S CONTROVERSIAL IDEOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS, WE CAN SET THE STAGE FOR A MORE ELABORATE AND ROBUST CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY THAT CAN BETTER EXPLAIN AND JUSTIFY THE LEGITIMACY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY.
306	AN EMERGING CONSENSUS REGARDS DOMESTIC AMNESTIES FOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AS GENERALLY INCONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS LEGAL CONSENSUS RESTS ON A NORM AGAINST IMPUNITY: THE CHIEF ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, AND OF THE FLEDGLING INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC), IS TO END IMPUNITY FOR VIOLATORS OF THE WORST OF CRIMINAL ACTS. BUT THE ANTI-IMPUNITY NORM, AND THE ANTI-AMNESTY CONSENSUS THAT HAS ARISEN FROM IT, NOW FACE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES. THE ICC'S ROLE IN THE ONGOING CONFLICT IN NORTHERN UGANDA ILLUSTRATES THE DEADLOCK THAT HAS NOW EMERGED BETWEEN COUNTRIES WISHING TO RETAIN THE POWER TO USE DOMESTIC POLITICS AND CRIMINAL LAW AS TOOLS FOR NEGOTIATION WITH CURRENT OR OUTGOING PERPETRATORS, ON THE ONE SIDE, AND THE ICC'S DETERMINATION TO APPLY A CONSISTENT INTERNATIONAL ANTI-IMPUNITY NORM, ON THE OTHER. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE ANTI-IMPUNITY NORM ITSELF IS BASED ON A NARROWLY RETRIBUTIVIST CONCEPTION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. A BROADER NORM FOR DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, BY CONTRAST, WOULD CONTINUE TO PREFER PROSECUTIONS OVER AMNESTIES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, LESS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR DESERVED RETRIBUTION FOR PERPETRATORS THAN FOR THE PUBLIC ENACTMENT OF THE DELIBERATIVE PROCEDURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
307	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW HONG KONG HAS EXERCISED POLITICAL INFLUENCE ON CHINA SINCE THE TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY IN 1997, AND TRIES TO COMPREHEND SUCH SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE INFLUENCES BY REINTERPRETING THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY. IT ARGUES THAT THE BRITISH HONG KONG EXISTED AS A 'REFERENCE SOCIETY' FOR CHINA'S MODERNIZATION AND HELPED TO CHANGE CHINESE PERCEPTIONS OF CAPITALISM. AS THIS RESULTED IN CHINESE RECOGNITION OF THE LEGITIMACY OF HONG KONG'S COLONIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH WERE FEATURED WITH POLITICAL LEGACIES OF CIVIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW, IT ALSO REVEALS THE INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION OF SOVEREIGNTY. SECONDLY, THE INFORMATION FLOW FROM HONG KONG TO CHINA REFLECTS A COMMUNICATIVE (IN CONTRAST TO COERCIVE) NATURE OF SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS HONG KONG'S CENTRAL POSITION IN THE CHINESE WORLD OF INFORMATION. THIRDLY, HONG KONG'S ONGOING DEMOCRATIZATION CHALLENGES CHINESE AUTHORITARIANISM THROUGH SOCIETAL INTERACTIONS THAT ARE BEYOND STATE CONTROL. CONCEPTUALLY, IN THIS ARTICLE, STATE SOVEREIGNTY IS ARGUED AS BEING SOMETHING FLUID AND CONSTANTLY RESHAPED IN EVERYDAY PRACTICE WITH INSTITUTIONAL, INFORMATIVE, AND INTERACTIVE DYNAMICS; PRACTICALLY, IT ATTEMPTS TO FIND SOME REMAINING 'SILVER LINING' TO THE GROWING AUTHORITARIAN CHINESE CLOUDS ABOVE HONG KONG AS REVERSING THE LOGIC OF EXAMINING EXTERNAL FACTORS IN DEMOCRATIZATION.
308	THROUGH THE METHOD OF REVIEWING SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTATION, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO DETERMINE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN LEGISLATION IN RUSSIA AND GERMANY. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARE ANALYZED, FROM WHICH THE CATEGORY "INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION" HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. TO FORM A UNIFIED CONCEPT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND CREATE AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED, THE NEED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IS ARGUED. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS INVESTIGATION, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES OF THE REGULATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONSOLIDATING THE RULE OF LAW AND IMPROVING CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION, AS THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND SET THE PERMISSIBLE LIMITS FOR RESTRICTING THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED.
309	THE YEAR 2021 MARKED THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF GUATEMALA'S LANDMARK PEACE ACCORDS. YET CELEBRATIONS OF THIS HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT STOOD IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE YEAR'S ALARMING TRENDS IN THE DETERIORATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. REVIEWING THE EVENTS OF 2021, THIS ARTICLE UNCOVERS TWO KEY PATTERNS IN GUATEMALAN POLITICS, BOTH EVIDENCE OF DEMOCRATIC DECLINE: 1) OPEN ASSAULTS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND BREACHES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, AND 2) AN ESCALATION IN THE CRIMINALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT CRITICS, PARTICULARLY THOSE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THE ANTI-CORRUPTION STRUGGLE. IT ALSO TAKES STOCK OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PATTERNS, INCLUDING THE ABYSMAL COVID-19 RESPONSE AND THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION AMID RESURGENT IMPUNITY. COMBINED, THESE DYNAMICS HAVE ALSO INCREASED TENSIONS WITHIN US-GUATEMALA RELATIONS AS THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE INCREASINGLY PERCEIVED THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AS AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER IN TACKLING THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION. IN SUM, 2021 WAS AN INFLECTION POINT IN GUATEMALA'?S 25-YEAR TRAJECTORY OF PEACE-ONE THAT HAS STEADILY SENT THE COUNTRY DOWN AN AUTHORITARIAN PATH LIKE MANY OF ITS NEIGHBORS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
310	ACCORDING TO GENERALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDS, AN INDEPENDENT BAR IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN SOCIETY, A NECESSARY PART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE RIGHT TO LEGAL AID CANNOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY RESTRICTIONS IN THE MARTIAL LAW PERIOD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE POST-WAR REFORM IS TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITY OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION UNDER THE BEST INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, STRENGTHEN THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CITIZEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND THE INSTITUTIONAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE BAR. THE ARTICLE MAKES A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE UKRAINIAN BAR ASSOCIATION DURING THE CONDUCT OF HOSTILITIES IN THE TERRITORY OF UKRAINE FOR SIX MONTHS, SHOWS THE REAL ACTIONS OF THE BAR AT THAT TIME, ANALYZES THE MAIN CHANGES IN LEGISLATION, BASED ON WHICH CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ON THE OBSERVANCE OF ADVOCATES' RIGHTS AND THE RIGHT TO PROFESSIONAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE DURING THE INTRODUCTION OF MARTIAL LAW IN UKRAINE. THE AUTHOR FORMULATED SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AIMED AT FURTHER IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION, BOTH IN THE MODERN AND POST-WAR PERIODS, FOLLOWING THE REQUIREMENTS OF UKRAINE'S EUROPEAN INTEGRATION.
311	THIS ARTICLE CONFIRMS THAT INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES ARE AN ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATION IN THE GROWING PANTHEON OF LEGAL AND COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHILE ALCOHOL CONTROL LAWS VARY BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS, THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION ARE CONFRONTED BY A COMMON THREAT OF UNDUE INDUSTRY INFLUENCE OR CAPTURE. THIS NECESSITATES A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PHENOMENON TO BETTER INFORM A COLLECTIVE AND EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. NEW SOUTH WALES AUSTRALIA, HAS DEVELOPED A LAYER OF ALCOHOL INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE LAWS IN THE FORM OF DISCIPLINARY SCHEMES. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXPLICATES THE FIRST OF THESE, THE VIOLENT VENUES SCHEME (VVS), TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF ANY CAPTURE. THIS WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISE HARM MINIMISATION STATUTORY OBJECTS AND DISRUPT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN CONTRAST, AN INFLUENTIAL INDUSTRY IDENTITY, ATTRIBUTED THE EARLIER LAST DRINKS LAWS, VVS AND A RELATED SCHEME AS CAUSING THE ALLEGED DESTRUCTION OF SYDNEY'S NIGHTTIME ECONOMY AND FUN. THE RESEARCH ALSO ANALYSES THE INDISPENSIBLE ROLE OF A NEOLIBERAL PARADIGM IN LEGITIMISING EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND INDUSTRY. THIS IS INDELIBLY IMPRINTED ON THE ALCOHOL REGULATORY LANDSCAPE.
312	IF THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT PREVAIL, CERTAIN PRIVILEGED GROUPS GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN COURT. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT LAW ENFORCERS IN RUSSIA ARE ONE OF THE SOCIAL GROUPS, WHICH, BEING UNDER INVESTIGATION, HAVE MUCH HIGHER CHANCES FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME OF THE COURT CASE. THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, INCLUDING THEIR SPECIAL STATUS AND LOYALTY OF THE JUDGES. WITHOUT REJECTING THESE POSSIBLE REASONS, WE ASSUME THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, HAVING A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES MORE EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL ATTORNEYS. BASED ON A SURVEY OF 3,317 ATTORNEYS, WE SHOW THE DIFFERENCE OF ETHICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF LAWYERS WHO HAVE OR DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF PROTECTING LAW ENFORCERS AND JUDGES. ATTORNEYS OF LAW ENFORCERS OFTEN HAD WORKING EXPERIENCE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. SUCH LAWYERS ACHIEVE MORE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN CONDITIONS OF "ACCUSATORY BIAS". IN ADDITION, THEY MORE OFTEN RECORD VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS, MORE OFTEN ACHIEVE POSITIVE RESULTS FOR THEIR CLIENTS. FINALLY, THE DEFENDERS OF LAW ENFORCERS ARE OFTEN "DEVIL'S ADVOCATES" AS THEY DECLARE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE REPUTATION OF MAFIA.
313	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE TWO DECADES SINCE HONG KONG'S RETURN TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY, ASSESSING DEVELOPMENTS AGAINST THE 1984 SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION, THE INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH HONG KONG WAS TRANSFERRED FROM BRITISH TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY ON JULY 1, 1997, AND WHICH FIRST SET OUT CHINA'S "BASIC POLICIES" TOWARD HONG KONG. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER'S ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENTS FOCUSES PARTICULARLY ON AREAS OF CONTROVERSY, FROM THE EXTENT TO WHICH HONG KONG HAS ENJOYED A "HIGH DEGREE OF AUTONOMY" TO BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND THE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. FINDINGS - IT ARGUES THAT ON THE WHOLE, THE POLICIES SET OUT IN THE JOINT DECLARATION HAVE BEEN WELL IMPLEMENTED: HONG KONG HAS RETAINED ITS SEPARATE SYSTEMS SINCE 1997, INCLUDING RULE OF LAW AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE "OCCUPY" MOVEMENT OF 2014, QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" ARRANGEMENT HAVE COME TO THE SURFACE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER IS DISTINCTIVE IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENTS AGAINST THE 1984 SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION.
314	OF THE FOREIGN CAPITAL FLOWS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR STIMULATING THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) HAS BEEN THE MOST ELECTED CANDIDATE THAT IS OFTEN SOUGHT. THIS EXPLAINS WHY SO MUCH EFFORT HAS BEEN GEARED TOWARDS ITS ATTRACTION THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR ENQUIRY INTO ITS DETERMINANTS. ARGUABLY, APART FROM THE CONVENTIONAL FDI-DRIVERS, THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN GROSSLY UNDERMINED. ON THIS BASIS, THE STUDY SETS OUT TO UNRAVEL THE CAUSAL LINKAGE BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND FDI WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON ECOWAS COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE EXISTENCE OF PREVALENT WEAK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AMONG THE ECOWAS COUNTRIES. FURTHER, ON COMPONENT-BY-COMPONENT BASIS, THIS RESULT WAS ROBUST TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE GOVERNANCE INDICATOR INTO THE SIX SUB-INDICES, NAMELY: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. WE SPLIT THE SAMPLE SIZE INTO LOW (POOR INSTITUTIONS) AND HIGH REGIMES (BETTER INSTITUTIONS) AND FOUND THAT COUNTRIES WITH BETTER INSTITUTIONS WERE ABLE TO ATTRACT FDI MORE THAN COUNTRIES WITH POORER INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THUS, INSTITUTING SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WILL OFFER A LEEWAY TOWARDS ATTRACTION OF MORE FDI INTO THE SUBREGION.
315	THE ATTRACTION OF BLUE-CHIP LISTINGS IN EMERGING STOCK MARKETS IS A MAJOR POLICY INITIATIVE COMMON ACROSS MUCH OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. IN MANY CASES HOWEVER, LOCAL BLUE-CHIP FIRMS ARE THE RESULT OF FOREIGN MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE (MNE) FIRMS ENGAGING WITH LOCAL INDIGENOUS PARTNERS TO FORM AN INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE (IJV). THESE ARE UNIQUE WITH BILATERAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES UNDERSCORING CO-OWNERSHIP BETWEEN PARTNERS OF RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AND ASSETS OF THE IJV. USING A UNIQUE AND COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLE OF 202 IPO FIRMS FROM ACROSS THE EMERGING AFRICAN REGION EVIDENCE OF BOTH A PRONOUNCED INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL ROLE FOR IJV BOARDS WAS FOUND. SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY CONCERNS DOMINATE THE EXTERNAL ROLE OF BOARDS IN PARTICULAR. INCREASING PROPORTIONS OF BOARDS DRAWN FROM COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL SOCIAL ELITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IJV IPO FIRMS IN HIGH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WHILE LOWER PROPORTIONS OF THESE ELITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CIVIL CODE LAW JURISDICTIONS RATHER THAN COMMON LAW. GOVERNMENTAL ELITES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRY-LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS IN CORRUPTION CONTROL AND POLITICAL STABILITY WHILE COMMERCIAL ELITES ARE ONLY MARGINALLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES.

316	THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A SECURITY SECTOR EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE POPULATION AND THE STATE FROM CHALLENGERS, AND WHICH AT THE SAME TIME FULFILS MINIMUM STANDARDS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, WAS A DAUNTING ONE IN AFGHANISTAN. THESE DIFFICULTIES WERE COMPOUNDED BY WHAT IN HINDSIGHT SEEM TO BE OBVIOUS MISTAKES ON THE PART OF THE INTERVENTION. IN OUR PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE HOW SECURITY SECTOR BUILDING FARED UNDER SUCH ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN NORTH-EAST AFGHANISTAN. WE FIND THAT IN SPITE OF THE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES AND THE MISTAKES MADE BY THE INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION, IT DID NOT FAIL COMPLETELY. NEITHER DID IT SUCCEED. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF QUANTITATIVE SURVEYS AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, WE SUGGEST THAT (A) THE INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION WAS PARTLY SUCCESSFUL IN BUILDING UP AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES - BOTH AS A FIGHTING FORCE AND IN TERMS OF SECURITY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE RESTRAINED TO SOME EXTENT BY THE RULE OF LAW; (B) THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY SETTING UP INFORMAL LOCAL MILITIAS (VIOLENT FEUDS, CRIMINALITY, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND EXTORTION OF THE POPULATION) COULD BE PARTLY MITIGATED BY TRANSFORMING THEM INTO AN OFFICIAL LOCAL POLICE PROGRAMME.
317	HOMICIDES OCCUR THE WORLD OVER, BUT THEY ARE NOT HOMOGENEOUSLY DISTRIBUTED BY GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS (CONTINENTS, COUNTRIES, REGIONS), EITHER OVER LONG OR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME, OR IN SOCIAL GROUPS, NAMELY AGE, GENDER, SOCIAL CLASS OR ETHNICITY. WHY ARE THERE MORE HOMICIDES IN SOME COUNTRIES THAN IN OTHERS? WHY DO KILLINGS INCREASE IN SOME COUNTRIES, WHILE THEY DECREASE IN OTHERS? THERE ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT FOR SOCIAL EXPLANATIONS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE: THOSE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGINS TO POVERTY AND INEQUALITY AND THOSE BLAMING INSTITUTIONALIZATION OR SOCIAL NORMS. TO DISCUSS THESE THEORIES, THIS PAPER ANALYZES AND COMPARES THE CHANGES IN COLOMBIA, VENEZUELA AND BRAZIL IN THE FIRST DECADE OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, WHERE THE HOMICIDE RATE HAS DECREASED, INCREASED AND REMAINED THE SAME, RESPECTIVELY. USING THE MEASUREMENT OF SIX VARIABLES (POVERTY, INEQUALITY, UNEMPLOYMENT, NATIONAL WEALTH, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW) AND THE TECHNIQUE OF TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT INSTITUTIONALIZATION IS MORE TO BLAME FOR THE CHANGE THAN POVERTY AND INEQUALITY. THE TEXT CONCLUDES THAT POVERTY AND INEQUALITY AFFECT CRIME AND HOMICIDES, ALTHOUGH NOT DIRECTLY, BUT MEDIATED BY THE INSTITUTIONS INSTEAD.
318	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF THE SIX COMPONENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS IN 15 ASIAN ECONOMIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2007 USING A FIXED EFFECT MODEL FOR PANEL DATA WITH HETEROSKEDASTICITY CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS. THE STUDY ALSO EMPLOYS THE FEASIBLE GENERAL LEAST SQUARE (FGLS) AND PRAIS-WINSTEIN PANEL ESTIMATION METHODS IN ORDER TO CHECK THE CONSISTENCY OF THE RESULTS WITH THE FIXED EFFECT MODEL. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT OF THE SIX COMPONENTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE THE KEY DETERMINANTS OF FDI INFLOWS, AS THEY EXHIBIT CONSISTENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT MODELS. HOWEVER, THE STUDY FINDS NO SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE WITH VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY IN FDI INFLOWS. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT HUMAN CAPITAL, INFRASTRUCTURE, LENDING RATE, AND GDP GROWTH RATE ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON FDI INFLOWS. WE CONCLUDE THAT A COUNTRY WHICH CAN ENHANCE ITS GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL IS LIKELY TO ATTRACT MORE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT DESPITE OFFSETTING DEFICIENCIES IN OTHER DIMENSIONS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE SUCH AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY.
319	IN RECENT YEARS RADICAL DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A PROMINENT PERSPECTIVE IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY. HOWEVER, RADICAL DEMOCRACY INVOLVES NUMEROUS THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF DEMOCRACY AS CAN BE WITNESSED IN THE WORK OF SOME THEORISTS WHO HAVE BEEN INFLUENTIAL ON RADICAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICS SUCH AS WILLIAM CONNOLLY, JUDITH BUTLER AND WENDY BROWN. ALTHOUGH ALL OF THESE THEORISTS AGREE THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE DOMINANT LIBERAL CONCEPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY, SOME OF THEM SEEM RELUCTANT TO CRITICISE THE WORKINGS OF DEMOCRACY IN FAVOUR OF ANALYSIS OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIBERALISM. WHILE RADICAL DEMOCRATS NEED TO RECOGNISE THESE LIMITATIONS, THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF MODERN DEMOCRACY SUCH AS POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, VOTING, REPRESENTATION AND THE RULE OF LAW ALSO NEED TO BE SUBJECTED TO CRITICAL SCRUTINY. OTHERWISE THE WORK OF THEORISTS SUCH AS CONNOLLY, BUTLER AND BROWN TENDS TO PRODUCE A MELANCHOLIC LAMENT FOR DEMOCRACY LOST WHICH DRAWS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE IDEA OF THE 'CONSTITUTIVE FAILURE' OF DEMOCRACY THAT ANIMATES SOME OF THE RADICAL DEMOCRATIC CANON OF CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN THEORISTS. IN SHORT, THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT RADICAL DEMOCRATIC THEORISTS NEED TO RECOGNISE THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT SACROSANCT.
320	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DETERMINANTS OF DIFFERENTIAL EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS APPLIED TO FOREIGN VERSUS DOMESTIC FIRMS. WE DEVELOP A MODEL OF EMPLOYMENT REGULATION AND TEST ITS IMPLICATIONS USING DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK'S WORLD BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT SURVEY, CONDUCTED IN 1999/2000. WE FIND THAT WHILE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, CORRUPTION, AND BRITISH LEGAL ORIGIN REDUCE THE EXTENT OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN FIRMS' EMPLOYMENT DECISION, THEY GIVE GREATER ADVANTAGE TO DOMESTIC RELATIVE TO FOREIGN INVESTORS. RULE OF LAW, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS A MORE EVEN EFFECT. BETTER INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COUNTRY ENHANCE THE GOVERNMENT'S BARGAINING POWER VIS-A-VIS INVESTORS AND INCREASE EMPLOYMENT INTERVENTION, ESPECIALLY IN FOREIGN FIRMS ENGAGED IN LESS TRADABLE SECTORS. WE ALSO IDENTIFY A HOST OF OTHER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS, THOUGH NONE OF THEM ENTAIL A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON FOREIGN INVESTORS. WE FIND THAT AFTER CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS, FOREIGN INVESTORS IN LATIN AMERICA FACE A GREATER REGULATORY DISADVANTAGE VIS-A-VIS LOCALS COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD, THOUGH THIS IS PARTLY COUNTERBALANCED BY OTHER EFFECTS CAPTURED IN THE MODEL.

321	UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF THE CURRENT ERA OF EVER-INCREASING SPEED OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ITERATION AND INCREASING APPLICATION OF BIG DATA, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT IN-DEPTH RESEARCH ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION AND TRY TO CONSTRUCT ITS SYSTEM. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BIG DATA, BUILDING AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT EXPLORATION. STARTING FROM CLARIFYING THE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION, THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF BIG DATA ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION. FINALLY, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO CONSTRUCT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF BIG DATA BY FOCUSING ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION MECHANISM OF THE BIG DATA PLATFORM, THE INTERACTION MECHANISM BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE BIG DATA PLATFORM, AND THE GUARANTEE MECHANISM OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATION UNDER THE BIG DATA PLATFORM TO PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF A "COMPLETE LEGAL NORM SYSTEM" AND AN "EFFICIENT RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM" TO ACHIEVE PRECISE GOVERNANCE.
322	A FAIR, SIMPLE, AND SPEEDY PROCEDURE IS THE BACKBONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO PROVIDE COMMON JUSTICE, TO PENALIZE THE CULPRITS AND TO WATCH THAT THE TRIAL PROCEDURE IS CONCLUDED WITHOUT DELAY BEFORE DISAPPEARING OF THE EVIDENCE AND WANING OF MEMORIES([1]). IT IS ISSUE OF THE GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN INDIA IS RETROGRESSING DAY BY DAY. THEREFORE, THE COMPLETE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SHOULD BE REVIEWED WITHOUT DELAY ESPECIALLY, IN THE COURT PROCEEDINGS AND THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME BY THE INVESTIGATING AGENCIES. AS SEVERAL ACTS, REGULATIONS AND THE PROVISIONS ARE OUTDATED AND OBSOLETE AND WITHOUT ANY USE. IT IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR THAT OUTDATED LAWS SHOULD BE REMOVED AND RECONSIDERS THE EXISTING LAWS. TO MAINTAIN THE FAITH OF PEOPLE IN JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM, THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HENCE, THE IDEA OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO FIGURE OUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION AND CHANGES WITH THE ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS AND TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SOCIETY TO MAINTAIN THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE.
323	THIS STUDY ASSESSES WHETHER IMPROVING GOVERNANCE STANDARDS AFFECTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN 44 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS. BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ARE USED, NOTABLY: (I) POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND "VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY"); (II) ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY), (III) INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (REPRESENTED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL); AND (IV) GENERAL GOVERNANCE (ENCOMPASSING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS). THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED: (I) HYPOTHESIS 1 (IMPROVING POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS); (II) HYPOTHESIS 2 (INCREASING ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CO2 EMISSIONS); AND (III) HYPOTHESIS 3 (ENHANCING INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CO2 EMISSIONS). RESULTS OF THE TESTED HYPOTHESES SHOW THAT THE VALIDITY OF HYPOTHESIS 3 CANNOT BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE RESULTS; HYPOTHESIS 2 IS NOT VALID, WHILE HYPOTHESIS 1 IS PARTIALLY NOT VALID. THE MAIN POLICY IMPLICATION IS THAT GOVERNANCE STANDARDS NEED TO BE FURTHER IMPROVED IN ORDER FOR GOVERNMENT QUALITY TO GENERATE THE EXPECTED UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS ON CO2 EMISSIONS.
324	AT PRESENT, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO RESOLVE VARIOUS SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS, SUCH AS PEOPLE'S EVER-GROWING NEED FOR A BETTER LIFE AND UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT. TO DO SO, URBAN GOVERNANCE PRACTICES INCLUDING HOLISTIC GOVERNANCE, DECENTRALIZED AND INTERCONNECTED GOVERNANCE, MULTIPLE PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE, AND SMART GOVERNANCE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CHINA. URBAN SMART GOVERNANCE SUPPORTED BY MOBILE INTERNET, THE INTERNET OF THINGS, QUANTUM COMPUTING, BIG DATA, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND OTHER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES HAS ALSO ENTERED THE FIELD OF VISION OF ACADEMICS AND ADMINISTRATORS. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH AND PRACTICE ON THE INTEGRATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND SMART GOVERNANCE TECHNOLOGY FOR URBAN GOVERNANCE IN CHINA ARE STILL INSUFFICIENT. HENCE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE DESIGN OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF AN URBAN SMART GOVERNANCE PLATFORM AND PRESENTS THE "1 + N" INTEGRATED SMART INFORMATION PLATFORM AND THE "POWER-SHARING LINKAGE, ONE-CENTER AND DUAL-TRACK" PLATFORM CONSTRUCTION COMMAND SYSTEM. IN THIS SYSTEM, THE FUNCTIONAL MODULE OF THE INFORMATION PLATFORM FOR SMART URBAN GOVERNANCE IS ELABORATED. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO PROMOTING THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S URBAN GOVERNANCE CAPACITY, WHICH CAN ENHANCE SOCIAL EQUITY AND SOCIAL ORDER, PROMOTE SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, AND ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF URBAN GOVERNANCE.
325	WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSFORMATION AND URBANIZATION OF CHINESE SOCIAL STRUCTURES, MORE AND MORE INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECTS ARE EMERGING. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT POLICY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHINESE INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECTS. THROUGH A LITERATURE REVIEW, A TOTAL OF 20 POLICY RISK FACTORS WERE DETERMINED, AND A TOTAL OF 10 INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECT MANAGERS IN SIX REGIONS NATIONWIDE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO COLLECT 398 EVALUATIONS OF THESE 20 RISK FACTORS FROM RELEVANT PROFESSIONALS. SECONDLY, THROUGH CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS, A SIX-PART POLICY RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE CRITICAL VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE POLICY RISK LEVEL WERE: (1) INDUSTRY MATURITY, (2) TAX POLICY, (3) FINANCIAL FREEDOM, (4) THE RULE OF LAW, (5) LOCAL MARKET SIZE, AND (6) LOCAL MARKET EXPERIENCE. MOREOVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND POLICY RISKS IN CHINESE INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECTS, AND APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES CAN CAPTURE THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND MITIGATE RISKS. AS THERE ARE FEW PIECES OF RESEARCH ON THE POLICY RISKS OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECTS IN CHINA, THIS STUDY HAS A CERTAIN REFERENCE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE POLICY RISK MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE RENEWAL PROJECTS IN CHINA.
326	ARGUABLY, MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE OR INTERSTATE ACTOR, GERMAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING THE GERMAN FEDERAL PUBLIC PROSECUTOR GENERAL (GENERALBUNDESANWALT, GBA) AND GERMAN FEDERAL CRIMINAL POLICE OFFICE (BUNDESKRIMINALAMT), HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF ISSUING ARREST WARRANTS FOR SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT SUSPECTED OF ATROCITY CRIMES IN THE WAKE OF THE ARAB SPRING. THIS INCLUDES GERMAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES MAKING THE FIRST ARREST OF A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN FEBRUARY 2019 FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN RELATION TO CORE INTERNATIONAL CRIMES, GERMANY'S CONCEPT OF LAW REFLECTS ONE BASED ON A 'STANDARD' AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. MOREOVER, GERMAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO USE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN AND CRIMINAL LAW (ICHL) IN RELATION TO THOSE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR CORE INTERNATIONAL CRIMES. IN THIS WAY, GERMANY'S CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN SYRIA SINCE 2011 PROVIDES FOR AN ILLUMINATING CASE FOR EXTENDING UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION, AS WELL AS THE 'RESPONSIBILITY TO PROSECUTE' AS A LEGAL OBLIGATION. IT ALSO INDICATES HOW A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTORS - INCLUDING STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS - CAN EXTEND THE REACH OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) CANNOT ACT.
327	THREATS AND ATTACKS AGAINST A COUNTRY INEVITABLY HAVE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. TOURISM IS ONE OF THE FIRST SECTORS IMPACTED. THE INDIRECT EFFECTS ARE WELL KNOWN: INSURERS INCREASE PREMIUMS AND REDUCE WARRANTIES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE DECREASES ... THESE HARMFUL EFFECTS JUSTIFY THE INTERVENTION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WHO REPRESENT, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THE FIRST AID IN PRESERVING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE COUNTRY'S GROWTH. NEVERTHELESS, THIS INTERVENTION MUST BE LIMITED IN TERMS OF DURATION AND AREA OF APPLICATION, SINCE PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD TAKE CENTER STAGE IN THE PROCESS: SECURING, REASSURING, HEALING, AND REBUILDING TOURIST DEMAND. WE WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE REGULATORY FUNCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IS THE CONTRACT-THE LEGAL EMBODIMENT OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE-THE CRADLE WHERE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE MAY BE REBORN? EVEN IF IT MEANS THAT THE LAW HAS TO BOOST, FORCE, OR RESUSCITATE THIS FEELING? THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE LEGAL STATUS OF A PARTICULAR CONTRACT-THE SALES CONTRACT FOR PACKAGE HOLIDAYS-TO TRY TO DEMONSTRATE HOW FRENCH CONTRACT LAW, AND IN PARTICULAR FRENCH CONSUMER LAW, TAKES PART IN PROTECTING "LEGALIZED CONFIDENCE" TO BETTER STIMULATE CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKET.
328	THE FUNCTIONING OF THE TAX SYSTEM AND TAXATION IN ONE ECONOMY IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE TO OVERALL FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND TAX EVASION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR RISKS, IF NOT ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY, AND, DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF TAXES EVADED, CAN TRIGGER SEVERE FINANCIAL INSTABILITY IN A COUNTRY. TODAY, MANY COUNTRIES ARE FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF TAX EVASION AND REPORTS OF TAX EVASION MULTIPLY BY THE DAY. NO TAX SYSTEM IS IMMUNE TO TAX EVASION, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE METHODS OF TAX EVASION IN DIFFERENT TAX SYSTEMS. MANY AND DIVERSE FACTORS, BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE, AFFECT TAX EVASION AS THEY ARE INTERTWINED AND DETERMINED AND MUTUALLY CONNECTED AND COMPLEMENTARY. TAX EVASION HAS MULTIPLICATIVE EFFECTS, IT DESTROYS THE REPUTATION OF INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY AND IN PARTICULAR THE REPUTATION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION, IT POSES A THREAT TO THE TAX SYSTEM AND RULE OF LAW, CAUSING TAXPAYERS' DISTRUST OF THE TAX SYSTEM ITSELF. THUS, BY REDUCING TAX EVASION THE SITUATION IN PUBLIC FINANCES IMPROVES SUBSTANTIALLY. RECOGNITION OF THE EXISTING KEY FACTORS OF TAX EVASION OR RESEARCH INTO THE EXISTENCE OF OTHERS JUST AS, IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS, DE FACTO CONFIRMS HOW COMPLEX, IMPORTANT AND CURRENT THIS ISSUE IS.
329	WHAT HAPPENS TO SOVEREIGN POWER WHEN PETTY SOVEREIGNS REFUSE TO EXPLOIT DISCRETIONARY POWER TO SUSPEND THE RULE OF LAW, THE VERY POWER THAT IS DELEGATED TO THEM AND MAKES THEM WHO THEY ARE? HOW MIGHT SUCH A REFUSAL CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND SOVEREIGN POWER? THIS ARTICLE REVISITS JUDITH BUTLER'S NOTION OF PETTY SOVEREIGNS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT PETTY SOVEREIGNS ESTABLISH A DISTINCTIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON A CASE INVOLVING ONE NAMELESS PETTY SOVEREIGN AND HIS PUBLISHED WRITINGS. HE WRITES NOVELS TO EXPOSE HOW LAW IS USED BY SOME OFFICIALS TO REALIZE A PARTICULAR POLICY GOAL WITH REGARDS TO NUCLEAR ENERGY. HIS NOVELS BLUR THE LINE BETWEEN FICTION AND NON-FICTION: IT CONTAINS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ONLY AVAILABLE TO BUREAUCRATS, DISCUSSES ACTUAL ENERGY POLICIES AND RELATED LAWS, AND INTRODUCES FICTIONAL CHARACTERS WHO RESEMBLE NON-FICTIONAL CHARACTERS. I ARGUE THAT THIS EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THAT PETTY SOVEREIGNS ARE NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THE NODE BETWEEN GOVERNMENTALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY. SHIFTING BETWEEN THE WORLDS OF FICTION AND NON-FICTION, PETTY SOVEREIGNS SLIP AWAY FROM SOVEREIGN POWER, WHICH CONTROLS THE SUBJECT-MAKING PROCESS, AND QUIETLY RESIST SOVEREIGN POLITICS THROUGH THE CONTINGENCY OF SUBJECTIVITY.
330	ONE OF LEGAL MEANS OF THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM IS THE INSTITUTE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL, WHICH FUNCTIONSIN THE CONDITION OF STABILITY OF THE SUPREME LAW, CREATES NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR REALIZATION AND ADAPTATION OF ITS PROVISIONS TO PUBLIC PRACTICE. IN THE MODERN LEGAL DOCTRINE, THE INSTITUTE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL IS CONSIDERED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE, THE NECESSARY STEP OF ADVANCE OF THE STATE TO THE DEMOCRATIC LAW-ABIDING STATE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, ADOPTION OF LAWS AND OTHER REGULATIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTENTS OF THE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS ARE MUCH WIDER AND MEANS THE SPECIALIZED CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL, CARRIED OUT BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE, INCLUDE THE ACTIVITY OF THE SUPREME BODIES OF THE GOVERNMENT, JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES AND PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, REPRESENT COMPLETE SYSTEM OF THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE INSTITUTE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL HAS GAINED WIDE RECOGNITION IN THE MODERN STATES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN. CONSIDERATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL GIVES THE CHANCE TO REVEAL THE MAIN REGULARITIES OF ITS EMERGENCE, DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT, TO SHOW THE PLACE AND THE ROLE IN THE MODERN POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM OF OUR SOCIETY.
331	AMERICAN PROSECUTORS OPERATE WITHIN LEGAL AND PRACTICAL LIMITS, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THOSE LIMITS ARE MORE ANEMIC FOR PROSECUTORS THAN FOR OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE OFFICIALS; THEY HAVE ALSO BECOME LESS EFFECTIVE OVER TIME. THE PROSECUTORIAL FUNCTION CAN BE REIMAGINED WITH MORE EFFECTIVE LEGAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND INTERNAL CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE RESPONSIVE PROSECUTORIAL SERVICES: THAT IS, PROSECUTORS WHO RESPOND TO LEGAL STANDARDS, TO PUBLIC SAFETY LOCAL PRIORITIES, TO INPUT FROM OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACTORS, AND TO THE LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE. THIS EFFORT TO MAKE PROSECUTORS MORE RESPONSIVE TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT RUNS COUNTER TO IDEALS IN MOST OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS A PROFESSIONALIZED AND INSULATED PROSECUTORIAL SERVICE. A MORE RESPONSIVE PROSECUTOR, HOWEVER, IS NECESSARY IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE STRONG TRADITION OF BROAD CRIMINAL CODES AND THE INGRAINED EXPECTATIONS THAT PROSECUTORS MUST SERVE JUSTICE AND NOT JUST EVALUATE THE LEGAL SUFFICIENCY OF INDIVIDUAL CASES. THE PROSECUTOR'S SENSE OF JUSTICE AN ESSENTIAL SUPPLEMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AMERICAN CONTEXT MUST TAKE SHAPE WITHIN INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES, GUIDED BY DEMOCRATIC PRIORITIES, AND NOT JUST BY THE PROSECUTOR'S INDIVIDUAL MORALITY.
332	THIS ARTICLE MAKES SEVERAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LITERATURE ON POLITICAL RISK AND THE DETERMINANTS OF CAPITAL INFLOWS. FIRST, I CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL FLOWS AND DEMOCRACY'S CONSTITUENT PARTS IN A WAY THAT TAKES ARGUMENTS BEYOND AGGREGATE DEMOCRACY INDICATORS AND STATIC POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES. SPECIFICALLY, I ARGUE THAT FAIR ELECTIONS SIGNAL GOVERNMENT RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A HIGHLY VISIBLE MANNER INVESTORS CAN ACCESS. I SHOW HOW INVESTORS THEREFORE USE THE FAIRNESS OF ELECTIONS AS A WAY TO ASSESS POLITICAL RISK AND TO INFORM THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT AND THE KINDS OF EVIDENCE OF ELECTORAL MISBEHAVIOR CONDITION ELECTIONS' INFLUENCE ON CAPITAL FLOWS. I ALSO DISAGGREGATE CAPITAL FLOWS INTO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AND PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT. I ARGUE THAT THE LOGIC OF INVESTING IS DIFFERENT IN THE SHORT TERM (PORTFOLIO) VERSUS THE LONG TERM (FDI). WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL RISK, I PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO RISK FACTORS THAN FDI BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVE EASE WITH WHICH PORTFOLIO INVESTORS CAN EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM AN INCREASINGLY RISKY MARKET AND SEEK SAFER RETURNS ELSEWHERE COMPARED TO DIRECT INVESTORS.
333	POLITICS IN KENYA REMAINS VULNERABLE TO ETHNIC TENSIONS DESPITE ITS OPENNESS AND VIBRANCY, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE ARGUED THAT KENYAN POLITICS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MATURE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE POLITICAL ECONOMY DYNAMICS BEHIND THE FIRST TWO ORDERLY PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSIONS IN POST-COLONIAL KENYA. IT PROPOSES A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT SHOWS HOW INSTRUMENTAL ETHNICITY PLAYS OUT IN A QUASI-DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETY IN WHICH ETHNIC ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE KEY CONDUITS FOR THE FLOW OF RENTS BETWEEN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ELITES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT SHOWS HOW THE INTERNAL FRAGMENTATION OF ETHNIC GROUPS INTENSIFIES THE STRUCTURAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH INTRA-ELITE PACTS IN WEAKLY INSTITUTIONALIZED POLITIES. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE 1978 AND 2002 PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSIONS IN KENYA WERE ORDERLY, PARADOXICALLY, BECAUSE SOME OF THE CRUCIAL POLITICAL AND ETHNIC ORGANIZATIONS WERE FRAGMENTED TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CREATED CONDITIONS OF GREAT UNCERTAINTY FOR THE ELITE. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE RULE OF LAW WAS UPHELD AS A LAST-DITCH STRATEGY TO MITIGATE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FACE OF RAMPANT FRAGMENTATION. THIS SHOWS THAT ULTIMATELY ELITE FRAGMENTATION CAN GENERATE POLITICAL STABILITY PROVIDED THAT THERE IS ENOUGH AT STAKE FOR THE ELITES.
334	THE ACT RESPECTING THE TRANSFER OF SECURITIES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SECURITY ENTITLEMENTS (HEREINAFTER THE "TSESE") HAS BROUGHT ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE LAW GOVERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SECURITY ENTITLEMENTS. IT HAS INDEED CREATED A REGIME OVERRIDING THE ORDINARY RULE OF LAW BY MAKING A PROVISION FOR CONTROLLING PLEDGES. THE TSESE HAS INTRODUCED NEW PROVISIONS INTO THE CIVIL CODE OF QUEBEC. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A CRITICAL VIEW OF THESE PROVISIONS SINCE THE TRADITIONAL RULES GOVERNING THE COLLATERALIZATION OR OPPOSABILITY OF THE PLEDGE ARE NOW QUESTIONED. ON THE ONE HAND, THE SUBSTANTIAL DELIVERY OF THE PROPERTY OR TITLE IS REPLACED BY THE CONCEPT OF CONTROLLING SECURITIES AND INTERMEDIATED TITLES. WHILE ON THE OTHER, THE TIME-DEPENDANT RULE OF CREDITORS HOLDING PLEDGES IS SET ASIDE. THE CONTROLLING PLEDGE TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER OTHER PLEDGES OR HYPOTHECS WITHOUT DISPOSSESSION BASED UPON THE SAME SECURITIES AND INTERMEDIATED TITLES. WE SHALL ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THIS TRANSFORMATION - THAT WE DEEM TO BE PROBLEMATICAL - AS REGARDS THE CLASSICAL CONCEPT OF THE PLEDGE. WE SHALL ALSO DESCRIBE THE LEGAL INCOHERENCIES AND UNCERTAINTIES BROUGHT ABOUT BY APPLYING SUCH A REGIME OVERRIDING THE ENTIRETY OF QUEBEC PERSONAL PROPERTY SECURITY LAW.
335	THE IMPARTIALITY OF INTERNATIONAL JUDGES, FACT-FINDERS AND RAPPORTEURS IS A CENTRAL ISSUE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND PRIOR OFFICE, THE STATUS OF PREVIOUS DECLARATIONS THAT MIGHT IMPINGE ON IMPARTIALITY REMAINS A COMPLEX MATTER WHOSE PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL RAMIFICATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN WHOLLY ADDRESSED. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PRIOR UTTERANCES MIGHT IMPUGN THE IMPARTIALITY OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL MANDATE HOLDERS INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT PROPOSES TO FRAME THE PROBLEM NOT MERELY AS IT RELATES TO A PARTICULAR KIND OF INTERNATIONAL AGENT (JUDGE, OR EXPERT, OR RAPPORTEUR), BUT MORE BROADLY AS INVOLVING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NOTION OF IMPARTIALITY AS SUCH. THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY PROPOSING A BROAD OUTLINE OF THE INTERNATIONAL IMPARTIALITY REGIME, DRAWING ON RECENT CASES AND PRACTICE. IT THEN MAKES THE ARGUMENT THAT IMPARTIALITY SHOULD BE EVALUATED BY EXAMINING A BROAD RANGE OF FACTORS THAT MAY DEMONSTRATE THE PRESENCE OF BIAS, AND THAT ARE NOT REDUCIBLE TO A SIMPLE LEGAL FORMULA. THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO OUTLINING THESE FACTORS ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING CASE LAW AND BEST PRACTICES.
336	THE CODE 5651 WHICH SETS INTERNET CENSHORSHIP IN TURKEY HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR 3 YEARS. WITH THIS LAWR, OUR COUNTRY TWANTED TO BE A LEADER AMONG DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES,, AND CHALLENGED GIANT COMPANIES LIKE YOUTUBE AND GOOGLE AND FINED THEM WITH TAX PENALTY. OUR COUNTRY T IS TRYING TO SET INTERNATIONAL LAW ON INTERNET VIA CODE 5651 AND DECISIONS OF ITS COURTS. BUT IT DOESN'T DO THIS BY DEFENDING OR NEGOTIATING THE ISSUE ON INTERNATIONAL FORUMS OR UNITED NATIONS. IT CONSIDERS INTERNET AS MEDIA AND IT PUNISHES AND BANS SIMILAR TO PRINTING PRESS.. A SERIOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE PRIME MINISTER, BREAK THE BAN. THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, STATE MINISTER FOR EU, MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION AND CHAIRMAN OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AUTHORITY GIVE STATEMENTS AGAINST THESE BANS. IN THE MEANTIME, RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS, FAIR TRIAL, AND BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS SUCH AS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ARE IGNORED. IN OTHER WORDS, A LEGAL TRADEGY OCCURS IN FRONT OF LAWYERS AND INTELLECTUALS. AND OUR COUNTRY COMMITS HARA-KIRI BY NOT UNDERSTANDING INTERNET, JUST LIKE THE SITUATION IN PRINTING MACHINE. IN THIS ARTICLE, VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF THE 3-YEAR STRUGGLE OF TURKEY WITH INTERNET ARE DISCUSSED.
337	EXTENSIVE URBANIZATION IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOPOLITICAL PHENOMENA OF OUR TIME. YET, WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY HAS FAILED TO TURN ITS ATTENTION TO THIS CRUCIAL TREND. IN PARTICULAR, THE BURGEONING CONSTITUTIONAL LITERATURE AIMED AT ADDRESSING PHENOMENA SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING, CONSTITUTIONAL RETROGRESSION, AND POPULIST THREATS TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW HAS FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PLACE AS AN EMERGING CLEAVAGE IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS. AN ALARMING DISCONNECT HAS EMERGED BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM'S OVERWHELMINGLY STATIST (OR WESTPHALIAN) OUTLOOK AND THE REALITY OF GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCALIZED CONCENTRATION OF WORLDVIEWS, POLICY PREFERENCES, AND POLITICAL IDENTITIES. IN THIS ESSAY, I IDENTIFY URBAN AGGLOMERATION AND THE ACCOMPANYING RESURGENCE OF THE URBAN-RURAL DIVIDE AS POSING A CRITICAL CHALLENGE TO LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AND ARGUE THAT THE TIME IS RIPE TO PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE SPATIAL DIMENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE RISE OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT POLITICAL RESENTMENT. TO THAT END, IN THE ESSAY'S FINAL PART I IDENTIFY SEVERAL AREAS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND THEORY THAT APPEAR TO HOLD SOME INTELLECTUAL PROMISE IN THINKING CREATIVELY ABOUT MITIGATING THE URBAN-RURAL DIVIDE, AND ABOUT THE MOUNTING URBAN CHALLENGE MORE GENERALLY.
338	THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY (FRT) FOR POLICING AND SURVEILLANCE IS SPREADING ACROSS ASIA, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA. ADVOCATES ARE SAYING THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN SOLVE CRIMES, LOCATE MISSING PEOPLE AND PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS. YET, AS THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, DEPLOYING FRT FOR POLICING AND SURVEILLANCE POSES A GRAVE THREAT TO CIVIL SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY OR TRACK PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY CRIMINAL HISTORY. IN EVERY POLITICAL SYSTEM, THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN DISCRIMINATORY POLICING, HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON ACTIVISM AND TURN EVERYONE INTO A SUSPECT. THE DANGERS RISE EXPONENTIALLY, MOREOVER, IN PLACES WITH INCONSISTENT RULE OF LAW, POOR HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS, WEAK PRIVACY AND DATA LAWS AND AUTHORITARIAN RULERS - TRAITS COMMON ACROSS SCORES OF COUNTRIES NOW INSTALLING FRT. REGULATING USE IS UNLIKELY TO PREVENT THESE HARMS, THE ARTICLE CONTENDS, GIVEN THE POWERFUL POLITICAL AND CORPORATE FORCES IN PLAY, GIVEN THE WAYS FIRMS PUSH LEGAL LIMITS, EXPLOIT LOOPHOLES AND LOBBY LEGISLATORS, AND GIVEN THE TENDENCY OVER TIME OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO CREEP ACROSS STATE AGENCIES AND INTO NEW FORMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL. CALLS TO BAN FRT ARE GROWING LOUDER BY THE DAY. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THE CASE FOR WHY BANS ARE ESPECIALLY NECESSARY IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
339	THE MENACE OF TERRORISM, WHEN BOOSTED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, INCARNATES INTO CYBER-TERRORISM. THIS NEW AVATAR OF TERRORISM IS MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE TRADITIONAL ONE. BY VIRTUE OF ITS LABYRINTHINE AND TRANS-BORDER, CYBER TERRORISM PRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE TO DEMOCRATIC STATES. MANY COUNTRIES, CURBED AND CURTAILED THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION, LIBERTY, PRIVACY AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN ORDER TO COMBAT THE MENACE OF CYBER TERRORISM. INDIA, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACIES, ENACTED SPECIFIC ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS TO TACKLE THE THREAT OF TERRORISM AND INCLUDED A PROVISION CONCERNING CYBER TERRORISM IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT. HOWEVER, COMBATING THE BLATANT AND HIDDEN ACTS OF CYBER TERRORISM IS NOT A REGULAR CRIMINAL JUSTICE-ENDEAVOUR; INSTEAD, IT IS A CHALLENGE TO THE STATE MACHINERY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO MAKE AN INQUIRY INTO THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF CYBER TERRORISM AND HIGHLIGHTS THE INDIAN LEGAL REGIME TO TACKLE THE MENACE OF CYBER TERRORISM. THE ARTICLE FURTHER CRITICALLY EXAMINES SECTION 66 (F) OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT TO PROVE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS PROVISION IS A STRINGENT MEASURE, AND IS AGAINST THE VERY STRUCTURE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
340	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN 2020. THE WORLD IS STILL MORE DEMOCRATIC THAN IT WAS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S, BUT A TREND OF AUTOCRATIZATION IS ONGOING AND AFFECTING 25 COUNTRIES IN 2020, HOME TO 34% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIZING COUNTRIES HAS DWINDLED BY NEARLY HALF, REDUCING TO 16 COUNTRIES, HOME TO A MERE 4% OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, DELIBERATION, RULE OF LAW AND ELECTIONS SHOW THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL NET DECLINES IN THE LAST DECADE. A MAJOR CHANGE IS THAT INDIA, FORMERLY THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY, TURNED INTO AN ELECTORAL AUTOCRACY. THE V-DEM DATA SUGGESTS THAT DIRECT EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON LEVELS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY WERE LIMITED IN 2020. STILL, THE LONGER-TERM CONSEQUENCES MAY BE WORSE AND MUST BE MONITORED CLOSELY. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND STATE RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY, MASS MOBILIZATION DECLINED TO ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER A DECADE, YET THE DECLINE IN PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTS IN 2020 MAY WELL PROVE TO BE SHORT-LIVED ONCE THE PANDEMIC SUBDUES.
341	ELECTRIFICATION RATES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ARE LOW DESPITE INCREASING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS. GOOD GOVERNANCE IS KEY TO TRANSLATE THESE EFFORTS INTO TANGIBLE ENERGY ACCESS IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, EVALUATING THE QUALITY OF ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE MULTITUDE OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED AND ITS DYNAMIC INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER DESIGNS A NOVEL, HOLISTIC ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO ASSESS ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE BASED ON THREE DATA COLLECTION METHODS: QUALITATIVE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS (QDA), SEMI-STRUCTURED STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND CLOSED SURVEYS. IT ASSESSES ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE ALONG SIX INDICATORS. APPLYING THIS APPROACH TO THE PREVIOUSLY UNSTUDIED CASES OF ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE IN UGANDA AND ZAMBIA ALLOWS US TO INDUCE A NEW MODEL OF THE TYPE OF INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT INDICATORS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. IT SUGGESTS THAT WHILE A MULTITUDE OF FEEDBACK LOOPS BETWEEN INDICATORS EXIST, BASIC RULE OF LAW AND TRANSPARENCY STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL PREREQUISITES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCLUSIVENESS, WHICH IN TURN FOSTER EFFICACY AND, ULTIMATELY, RESPONSIVENESS OF ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE. FOR UGANDA AND ZAMBIA SPECIFICALLY, OUR ANALYSES REVEAL SHORTCOMINGS ACROSS ALL SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, HAMPERING ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS. KEY LEVERS INCLUDE COMPLETING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS, IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY, AND DESIGNING MEANINGFUL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS TO FOSTER INCLUSIVENESS, AND RESPONSIVENESS OF ENERGY ACCESS GOVERNANCE.
342	THIS ARTICLE USES PANEL-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS (PCSE) ESTIMATOR AND DYNAMIC FIXED EFFECTS AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (DFE ARDL) ESTIMATOR TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION ON SHADOW ECONOMY FOR A GLOBAL SAMPLE OF 112 ECONOMIES (BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015). OUR EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI), TRADE OPENNESS, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND SHADOW ECONOMY HAVE BI-CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS. NOTABLY, THE RESULTS SHOW A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND FDI INFLOWS BUT A WEAKER NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF TRADE OPENNESS ON SHADOW ECONOMY. THERE IS ALSO LONG-RUN COINTEGRATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH SHADOW ECONOMY, AND HETEROSCEDASTIC EFFECTS OF THESE FACTORS IN SHORT RUN- AND LONG RUN. ESPECIALLY, TRADE OPENNESS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN BOTH SHORT RUN AND LONG RUN, WHILE FDI INFLOWS HAVE A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE IN THE SHORT RUN BUT IT IS POSITIVE IN THE LONG RUN. INTERESTINGLY, THE INFLUENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS QUITE HETEROGENEOUS SINCE THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE SHORT RUN, WHILE THE POLITICAL STABILITY HAS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THE LONG RUN.
343	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OVER THE MOST IMPORTANT CROWN WITNESS REGULATIONS IN GERMANY: THE "KLEINE KRONZEUGENREGELUNG" OR "SMALL" CROWN WITNESS REGULATION FOR NARCOTICS-RELATED CRIME (SECTION 31 BETAUBUNGSMITTELGESETZ, LAW ON NARCOTICS, BTMG) AND THE "GROSSE KRONZEUGENREGELUNG" OR "LARGE" CROWN WITNESS REGULATION OF GENERAL CRIMINAL LAW (SECTION 46B STRAFGESETZBUCH, CRIMINAL CODE, STGB). AFTER INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT AND ITS LEGISLATIVE HISTORY (I.), THE ARTICLE WILL MOVE ON TO A NORMATIVE AND DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS (II.). AS THIS ANALYSIS WILL SHOW, THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RULES GIVES RISE TO NUMEROUS PROBLEMS, RAISING CONCERNS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND MAKING THESE REGULATIONS UNWIELDY IN PRACTICE. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS (III.) IN TURN SHOW THAT SECTION 31 BTMG HAS BECOME STANDARD REPERTORY WHEN PROSECUTING NARCOTICS-RELATED CRIME, WHILE SECTION 46B STGB LANGUISHES IN THE SHADOWS SOMEWHAT. GEOGRAPHICAL AND STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS HINDER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOTH REGULATIONS. THE LEGISLATIVE GOAL OF BREAKING UP OR AT LEAST SHEDDING LIGHT UPON THE CLOSED-OFF STRUCTURES OF ORGANISED CRIME IS NOT ACHIEVED. NEVERTHELESS, THE REGULATIONS APPEAR TO CONSTITUTE AN INDISPENSABLE INVESTIGATIVE TOOL, ALBEIT ONE THAT REQUIRES MORE PRECISE REGULATION WITH REGARD TO ITS PRACTICABILITY AND THE CONDITIONS DEMANDED BY A FAIR CRIMINAL PROCESS.
344	RECENTLY THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL REVISION HAS QUESTIONED THE CONSOLIDATED INTERPRETATION OF THE HABSBURG EMPIRE, FOUNDED ON THE IDEA OF BACKWARDNESS, ANACHRONISM, CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATIONALITIES, INEVITABLE DECLINE, DEEPENING THE THEME OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST DECADES OF THE EMPIRE'S LIFE AND PARTICULARLY IN CISLEITANIA, A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF NEGOTIATIONS AND COMPROMISES HAS MARKED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CENTER AND THE PERIPHERY. THE MEDIATION ROLE PLAYED BY THE BUREAUCRACY IS PART OF THE JOSEPHINE TRADITION AND SUPPORTS THE PROGRESS OF THE RULE OF LAW (RECHTSTAAT) ALSO IN THE HABSBURG EMPIRE. IN THE KOERBERIAN ERA, THE HIGH CIVIL SERVICE CORPS REPLACES TEMPORARILY THE PARLIAMENT AND HIS WORK IS NO LONGER READ SIMPLY AS AN AUTHORITARIAN PROJECT BUT AS A << BUREAUCRATIC GOVERNMENT PROJECT >> THAT TENDS TO BUILD A MODERN AND REFORMED WELFARE STATE, TO BRING STATE AND SOCIETY CLOSER AND TO REDUCE NATIONALISTIC TENSIONS. THE GROWTH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN AUSTRIA POSITIVELY INSERTS THE HABSBURGS FINAL DECADES IN EUROPEAN HISTORY AND OPENS UP INTERESTING PROSPECTS FOR COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES THAT EXPERIENCE SIMILAR APPROACHES IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND CITIZENS, SUCH AS GIOLITTI'S ITALY.
345	TRIPS AGREEMENT ENCOURAGES WTO MEMBERS TO ENHANCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) PROTECTION, AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN PUSHING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF IP. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD FOR THE MARKET. THE DAMAGES FOR IP INFRINGEMENT INCREASED DRASTICALLY IN CHINA IN RECENT YEARS. THIS HAS DRAWN OUR ATTENTION TO THE APPLICATION OF THE CHINESE IP LAWS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSED THE RULES IN CHINESE PATENT, TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT LAWS AND THEIR APPLICATION BY CHINESE COURTS REGARDING DAMAGES ADJUDICATION WITH MOST UPDATED LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS, STATISTICS, IMPORTANT CASES AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL POLICIES OF THE CHINESE SUPREME COURT. THE ARTICLE FOUND THAT, DRIVEN BY JUDICIAL POLICY, THE COURTS USED SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION TO ACHIEVE INCREASE OF DAMAGES UNJUSTIFIABLY. THIS IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD FOR THE MARKET BECAUSE, THOUGH FAVOURABLE TO IPR OWNERS, IT IS HARMFUL TO THE RULE OF LAW AND IT MAKES IP ENFORCEMENT A BUSINESS TO MISAPPROPRIATE LICIT PROFIT OF INFRINGER, ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE EMERGING IP TROLLS. CHINA SHOULD CARRY OUT REFORM TO IMPROVE THE LEGAL REGIME OF DAMAGES FOR IP INFRINGEMENT. THE SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS LIES IN RESORTING TO THE STRICT APPLICATION OF COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.
346	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES FROM THE POLITICAL THEORY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION IN VENEZUELA OF A TOTALITARIAN REGIME. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IT BEGAN WITH A FORM OF DELEGATIVE DEMOCRACY, FROM 2005, WHICH DEGENERATED INTO A COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM (2012 ONWARDS), TO FINALLY BECOME A TOTALITARIAN SYSTEM, BASED ON THE CONFLICT OF POWERS BETWEEN THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WITH THE WEAKENING AND ANNIHILATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ACTIONS OF THE ILLEGITIMATE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, NOT ONLY INCONSTITUTIONALLY INVADED EXCLUSIVE POWERS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, BLOCKING THE PROPER FUNCTIONS OF IT, BASED PRINCIPALLY OF IDEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS MORE THAN IN THE LAW, WHICH LED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PURELY ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY, WITH TOTALITARIAN ASPECTS, WITH THE IMPOSITION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SPURIOUS CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, THAT CONTINUOUSLY MODIFIES THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE WILL OF THE CURRENT RULER, IN THIS CASE OF STUDY, NICOLAS MADURO. IN THIS WAY, CITIZENS ARE VIOLATED THEIR RIGHT TO CHOOSE, UNDERMINING POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, SUCH AS COMPLETELY UNDERMINE THE ELECTORAL MANDATE EXPRESSED ON DECEMBER 6, 2015 AND THE PRINCIPLES OF INTEGRAL DEMOCRACY.
347	THE CONVICTION OF A GAY COUPLE IN MALAWI ON MAY 20, 2010 RAISES SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT ISSUES OF CULTURAL RIGHTS, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, COMMUNITY RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN COMMUNITIES AND ARE BOUND BY THE NORMS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS OF THEIR CUSTOMS, TRADITIONS, AND CULTURE. IN TERMS OF NATURAL RIGHTS, HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE TO LIVE AS THEY PLEASE, AS LONG AS THEIR ACTIONS DO NOT INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN COMMUNITY RIGHTS CLASH WITH INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND THE COMMUNITY DENIES INDIVIDUALS THE EXERCISE OF THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE. THE HANDING DOWN OF A 14-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE, WITH HARD LABOR, BY A MAGISTRATE'S COURT TO A GAY COUPLE CONVICTED FOR GROSS PUBLIC INDECENCY IN THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI IS A CASE IN POINT. THIS SENTENCE NOT ONLY CONTRAVENES THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN TERMS OF NATURAL JUSTICE BUT ALSO VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION OF MALAWI WHICH OUTLAWS DISCRIMINATION OF ANY KIND AND ADVOCATES EQUALITY. THIS ARTICLE MAINTAINS THAT COEXISTENCE AND HARMONY AMONG INDIVIDUALS IN PLURAL SOCIETIES CAN BE ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH TOLERANCE, WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY.
348	ACCUSATIONS OF ABUSE AND TORTURE IN THE COUNTER-INSURGENCY CAMPAIGN AGAINST MAU MAU REBELS IN KENYA WERE WIDELY PUBLICISED DURING THE 1950S. THE TYPICAL BRITISH RESPONSE WAS TO ISSUE OFFICIAL DENIALS, AND WHEN PROSECUTIONS DID ARISE THE PERPETRATORS WERE CHARACTERISED AS PATHOLOGICAL, THEIR BEHAVIOUR PRESENTED AS ISOLATED AND EXCEPTIONAL. NEW EVIDENCE FOUND IN THE BRITISH COLONIAL 'MIGRATED ARCHIVE' FOR KENYA NOW CONFIRMS THAT THE PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND ABUSE WAS WIDESPREAD, AMOUNTING TO A SYSTEMATIC PATTERN OF STATE POLICY. THIS ARTICLE REJECTS DISPOSITIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL EXPLANATIONS OF BRITISH TORTURE IN KENYA AND INSTEAD EXAMINES THE VIOLENCE IN TEMPORAL AND STRUCTURAL TERMS, SHOWING HOW THE TOLERATION OF VIOLENCE AT AN EARLY STAGE OF THE EMERGENCY LED TO ITS INSTITUTIONALISATION IN KENYA'S DETENTION CAMPS AT A LATER STAGE. THE ARTICLE OFFERS EVIDENCE FROM THE SCREENING PROCESS IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE COUNTER-INSURGENCY CAMPAIGN, AND FROM THE 'DILUTION TECHNIQUE' APPLIED IN THE DETENTION CAMPS AFTER 1956 IN THE FINAL PHASE OF THE WAR TO ILLUSTRATE THE ARGUMENT. THE CONCLUDING DISCUSSION EXPLORES THE DILEMMAS CONFRONTING KENYA'S COLONIAL VIOLENCE WORKERS AND THEIR POLITICAL MASTERS AS THEY STRUGGLED TO PRESENT TORTURE AS LYING WITHIN THE 'RULE OF LAW'.
349	LEGAL PLURALISM IS AN APPROACH WHICH ACCEPTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT, WITHIN ANY GIVEN POLITY, THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE 'LEGAL ORDER' AND THAT THE STATE IS NOT THE EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF LEGAL REGULATION. NEVERTHELESS, DEFINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR SOCIAL RELATION IS LEGALLY SANCTIONED IS A HIGHLY POLITICAL MATTER SINCE LAW DETERMINES RIGHTS OVER PEOPLE AND OVER ECONOMIC RESOURCES - LAND, FOREST, WATER AND MINERALS. THE EXPERIENCE OF COLONIALISM SHOWED HOW STALE LAW COULD BE USED TO DEPRIVE PEOPLE OF THEIR LAND RIGHTS. PRIVATE PROPERTY LAW DURING THE EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE OF INDUSTRIALISATION WAS USED TO JUSTIFY EXPLOITATION OF LABOUR AND RELATIONSHIPS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE SHOULD NOT ROMANTICISE LOCAL OR CUSTOMARY LAWS WHICH MAY EQUALLY ENFORCE THE INTERESTS OF OPPRESSIVE LOCAL ELITES. THE MERIT OF THE LEGAL PLURALISM APPROACH IS, HOWEVER, THAT IT FORCES US TO CONCENTRATE ON THE EMPIRICAL REALITY BEHIND SLOGANS ABOUT THE 'RULE OF LAW'; WE SHOULD ALWAYS ASK, WHAT IS THE ACTUAL EFFECT OF A PARTICULAR NORMATIVE ORDER - WHETHER STATE OR NON-STATE, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE - ON PEOPLE'S RIGHTS OVER ESSENTIAL RESOURCES AND ON THEIR 'ACCESS TO JUSTICE', IN THE TRUE SENSE.
350	AS MEDICO-LEGAL STATISTICS SHOW, COMPARED WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF MEDICINE, CASES OF LIABILITY OF THE RADIOLOGIST OR HIS ASSISTANTS ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THE DUTY TO EXERCISE DUE CARE AS SET OUT IN .BDINTG. 6 OF THE AUSTRIAN PENAL CODE OR .BDINTG. 276 OF THE GERMAN CIVIL CODE ALSO PROVIDES A BASIS RULE OF LAW FOR RADIOLOGY. DUE TO THE RISK INHERENT IN THE INVESTIGATION, INCIDENTS DURING ANGIOGRAPHY CANNOT BE TOTALLY EXCLUDED. IT IS THEREFORE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT ALL STEPS BE TAKEN WITH REGARD TO STAFF, EQUIPMENT AND DRUGS TO DEAL WITH ANY COMPLICATIONS AND INCIDENTS THAT MAY ARISE. THE COURTS OF LAW REQUIRE THE EMPLOYER TO PRODUCE THE STRONGEST EXONERATING EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE DUTY TO EXERCISE DUE CARE IN THE SELECTION AND SUPERVISION OF THE ASSISTANTS HAS BEEN DULY FULFILLED. FOR THE PRACTICAL EXECUTION OF RADIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT, THE RADIOLOGIST''S TECHNICAL ASSISTANT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE; HER LIABILITY WHEN PERFORMING AN IRRIGATION IS PARTICULARLY GREAT, AS PERFORATION OF THE INTESTINE IS OFTEN LETHAL. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE RECTAL TUBE INTO THE VAGINA BY MISTAKE, WITH RESULTANT INJURY OR DEATH OF THE PATIENT, WILL REGULARLY LEAD TO CONVICTION UNDER PENAL LAW.
351	THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE, EUROPE'S MOST IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION, IS DEVELOPING A LEGALLY BINDING INSTRUMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, AND APPLICATION OF AI SYSTEMS. THIS "CONVENTION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW" (AI CONVENTION) AIMS TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST THE HARMS OF AI. THE AI CONVENTION MAY BECOME THE FIRST LEGALLY-BINDING INTERNATIONAL TREATY ON AI. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE HIGHLIGHT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED AI CONVENTION FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION OF PATIENTS. WE PRAISE THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS [1]. GLOBAL REGULATION FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT EASILY CROSSES JURISDICTIONS [2]. THE HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT [3]. THE ACTOR-NEUTRAL, FULL-LIFECYCLE APPROACH [4]. THE CREATION OF ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS THROUGH THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS COURT. WE SIGNAL THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES [1]. THE SECTOR-NEUTRAL APPROACH [2]. THE LACK OF REFLECTION ON NEW HUMAN RIGHTS [3]. DEFINITIONAL ISSUES, AND [4] THE PROCESS OF GLOBAL NEGOTIATIONS. WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE NOT TO COMPROMISE ON THE WIDE SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND THE RIGHTS-BASED CHARACTER OF THE PROPOSED AI CONVENTION.
352	COURTS CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE, BUT THEIR DECISIONS ARE BINDING PRECEDENT ON DICTED-BREAK DOWN THIS SYSTEM OF STARE DECISIS. WHAT MADE SENSE YESTERDAY NO LONGER MAKES SENSE TODAY. LEVERAGING AN UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNOLOGY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND STARE DECISIS, THIS NOTE PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH TO COPYRIGHT FAIR USE DECISIONMAKING THAT INVOLVES UTILITY-EXPANDING TECHNOLOGIES, OR TOOLS THAT RADICALLY CHANGE THE USE OF AND ACCESS TO COPYRIGHTED WORKS. WHEN APPLYING PAST PRECEDENT, COURTS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONTEXTUALIZE PRIOR DECISIONS' ANALYSES OF THE FIRST AND FOURTH FAIR USE FACTORS WITHIN THE PRECEDENT'S TIME AND PERFORM A SIMILAR ANALYSIS FOR THE CURRENT CASE IN THE CURRENT ERA. THE MORE THAT THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES DIVERGE BETWEEN THE TWO CASES, THE LESS WEIGHT THE COURT SHOULD GIVE TO THE PAST PRECEDENT. MOREOVER, WHEN GENERATING PRECEDENT ON UTILITY-EXPANDING TRANSFORMATIVE FAIR USES, COURTS SHOULD NARROW THEIR FAIR USE DECISIONS TO THE DISPUTE BEFORE THE COURT AND ONLY RULE ON THE SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY IN QUESTION-HELPING ENSURE THAT THE BALANCE BETWEEN ADVANCING TECHNOLOGICAL INTERESTS AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF CONTENT CREATORS DOES NOT BECOME ROOTED IN SHORTSIGHTED THINKING FROM A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT PAST.
353	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW STATES RESPOND TO THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR PROMOTING FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR BELIEF (FORB). IT APPLIES THE FRAMEWORK OF STIGMA MANAGEMENT TO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSES OF INDONESIA TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE DUE TO THE IMPRISONMENT OF BASUKI TJAHAJA PURNAMA OR AHOK FOR ALLEGEDLY DEFAMING ISLAM (2016-2017). THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE RESPONSES WERE NOT MONOLITHIC. THE STATE ARTICULATED A NARRATIVE THAT AFFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING FORB, BUT ALSO HELD THAT IT IS LESS URGENT COMPARED TO RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW AND MAINTAINING INDONESIA'S SOVEREIGNTY. THE INDONESIAN ISLAMISTS DISSEMINATED A NARRATIVE THAT REJECTED THE FORB NORMS, FRAMING THEM AS AN EXPRESSION OF WESTERN HYPOCRISY. THIS VARIETY OF RESPONSES IS REFLECTIVE OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONFIGURATION. THE STATE'S NARRATIVE WAS INTENDED TO APPEASE THE INCREASINGLY POWERFUL ISLAMISTS AND MITIGATE THE INTERNATIONAL LOSS OF REPUTATION. THE ISLAMISTS' RESPONSE, MEANWHILE, REFLECTED THEIR ATTEMPTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL DISCOURSES OF FORB ON THEIR PROJECTS TO INCREASE THEIR DOMESTIC POWER. COMBINED, HOWEVER, THESE DISCOURSES RESULTED IN THE JUSTIFICATION OF AHOK'S PROSECUTION AND THE PRACTICE OF INDONESIAN BLASPHEMY LAWS.
354	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO DISCUSS CONCEPTUAL IDEAS ON THE STATE OF LEGAL SUPPORT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IN DENMARK, NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF THESE COUNTRIES IN UKRAINE. THE ARTICLE USES SUCH METHODS AS DIALECTICAL, COMPARATIVE LAW, SYSTEMSTRUCTURAL, FORMAL-DOGMATIC, MODELLING AND FORECASTING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, DESPITE THE ABILITY OF EU COUNTRIES TO INTRODUCE THEIR OWN ELECTORAL LEGISLATION AND CHOOSE THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF EVERYONE TO VOTE OR BE ELECTED IS ENSURED BY COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF ORGANIZATION AND CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE COUNTRIES STUDIED: DENMARK, NEW ZEALAND AND THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS WELL ORGANIZED. IT IS STATED THAT THE DUE LEGAL SUPPORT OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS A TOOL FOR THE FORMATION OF LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE BODIES OF STATE POWER AND LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION, IT IS PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UKRAINIAN ELECTORAL LEGISLATION THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF SOME COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE WAYS TO IMPROVE IT.
355	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONALISATION OF GOVERNANCE, BUREAUCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ON THE TIMEFRAMES EMPLOYED FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. IT ARGUES THAT THE URGENCY OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS CONSISTENTLY GIVEN WAY TO TEMPORALLY EXTENDED JUSTICE PROJECTS AS STATE STRENGTH PERMITS REVISION OF INITIAL LENIENCY IN TERMS OF TRUTH, CRIMINAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND VETTING, WHILE STATE WEAKNESSES COMPEL THE DELAY OF PROJECTS PENDING INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR CONSOLIDATION THROUGH LONG-TERM PEACEBUILDING MISSIONS. FURTHERMORE, A MORE RECENT FOCUS ON TRANSFORMATIVE SOCIAL CHANGE THAT LOOKS AT ECONOMIC ROOT CAUSES OF CONFLICT WOULD REQUIRE STATES AND POLICYMAKERS TO USE A LONGER, MULTIGENERATIONAL TIME FRAME FOR ACTION. IN THE ABSENCE OF THEORETICAL WORK ON HOW THESE MULTI-GENERATIONAL COMMITMENTS MIGHT BE REALISED, THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON LITERATURE IN THE FIELD OF DEVELOPMENT TO OUTLINE A PLAUSIBLE MODEL FOR HOW TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, PEACEBUILDING AND DEVELOPMENT ARE DYNAMICALLY REALISED OVER TIME. IT ARGUES THAT FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE TO BE EVEN MINIMALLY TRANSFORMATIVE, IT MUST BE EMBEDDED IN TOP-DOWN DEVELOPMENTAL INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT SUFFICIENTLY ROBUST TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. IT MUST ALSO BE EMBEDDED IN BOTTOM-UP DEVELOPMENTAL COALITIONS WHOSE EVERYDAY POLITICAL CONTESTS CAN SHAPE THE STRUCTURE AND EFFECTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS OVER TIME.
356	SINCE THE EARLIEST HUMAN SOCIETIES, THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING STRUGGLE BETWEEN HIERARCHY AND RESISTANCE TO HIERARCHY, AND THIS STRUGGLE IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF THE EVOLUTION OF MORALITIES AND OF INSTITUTIONS. ATTEMPTS TO INITIATE OR SUSTAIN HIERARCHIES ARE OFTEN MET WITH RESISTANCE; HIERARCHS THEN ADOPT NEW STRATEGIES, WHICH IN TURN PROMPT NEW STRATEGIES OF RESISTANCE; AND SO ON. THE KEY POINT IS THAT THE STRUGGLE IS TYPICALLY CONDUCTED USING MORAL CONCEPTS IN JUSTIFICATIONS FOR OR AGAINST UNEQUAL POWER AND INVOLVES THE STIMULATION OF THE MORAL EMOTIONS. BOTH PARTIES TO THE STRUGGLE TREAT MORALITY AS A VALUABLE STRATEGIC RESOURCE; AND THE DYNAMIC OF INTERACTION BETWEEN HIERARCHS AND RESISTERS GENERATES CHANGES IN THAT RESOURCE. THE HIERARCH/RESISTER STRUGGLE IS IN PART A COMPETITION BETWEEN MORAL CONCEPTS AND JUSTIFICATIONS, AND THAT COMPETITION DRIVES THE EMERGENCE OF NEW MORAL CONCEPTS AND JUSTIFICATIONS, JUST AS COMPETITION IN OTHER CONTEXTS GENERATES INNOVATIONS. AMONG THE MORAL CONCEPTS GENERATED BY THE STRUGGLE ARE THE FOLLOWING: AUTHORITY, LEGITIMACY, ARISTOCRACY, THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS, THE MANDATE OF HEAVEN, NATURAL RIGHTS, CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY, COLLECTIVE SELF-DETERMINATION, EXPLOITATION, OPPRESSION, AND DOMINATION.
357	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ANALYSE THE ISSUES SURROUNDING RECENT DECLARATIONS OF OPENING OF SOME DOCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN MEXICO (M68 AND CISEN), SHELTERED BY MEXICO'S GENERAL ARCHIVE OF THE NATION (AGN, BY ITS SPANISH ACRONYM). THE PAPER FOCUSES ON TWO MODALITIES OF EPISTEMIC INJUSTICES: TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICES AND HERMENEUTICAL INJUSTICES. THESE TERMS ARE CONTEXTUALIZED WITHIN THE NATURE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL REALITY THROUGH ARCHIVAL COLLECTIONS, AND ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE TYPES OF INJUSTICE INVOLVED WITH THE HISTORICAL PROCESSING OF THESE COLLECTIONS. ONE DIMENSION OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION (ACCORDING TO THE MEXICAN RULE OF LAW), REFERS TO THE PREROGATIVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ACCESS PLURAL AND TIMELY INFORMATION. THIS WORK PRESENTS A SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT WITH A GROUP OF HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENTS THAT ARE A RELATIVELY NEW, POTENTIALLY UNFAMILIAR, AND UNDERSTUDIED PHENOMENON TO AN ARCHIVAL AUDIENCE. THESE DOCUMENTARY COLLECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT, SINCE THEY CONTAIN INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE PERIOD KNOWN AS 'DIRTY WAR', BUT ALSO TESTIMONIES OF VICTIMS, FAMILIES, AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTS WHO LIVED THE FACTS.
358	THE GUARANTEE CIVIL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS AS INSEPARABLE RIGHTS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY SOUGHT FOR SINCE THE 1970S AND HAS INFLUENCED THE REORGANIZATION OF HEALTH CARE MODELS IN FACE OF THE RECOGNITION OF NEW SUBJECTS OF RIGHT. IN BRAZIL, ONE OF THE MOST EVIDENT ASPECTS OF THIS SCENARIO WAS THE VISIBILITY OF THE PSYCHIATRIC REFORM AS A STRUCTURING PART OF THE BRAZILIAN HEALTH REFORM THAT TREADED ALONG THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THIS STUDY AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUALIFICATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH POLICY MONITORING PROCESS BY THE STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, BASED ON THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE MAIN POINTS OF ACADEMIC DEBATES ON PROCESS OF DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PEOPLE. THIS IS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY CONSISTING OF A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE IN TECHNICAL (NORMS, ORDINANCES, LAWS, RESOLUTIONS) AND SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BASED ON ELECTRONIC DATA FROM THE BIBLIOTECA VIRTUAL EM SAUDE AND USING THE DESCRIPTORS: "DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION" AND "MENTAL HEALTH" OR "PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS". IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE BRAZILIAN PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE IS A PERMANENT AND ESSENTIAL INSTITUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ENTRUSTED WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION OF ACTING IN DEFENSE OF SOCIAL INTERESTS, THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE DEMOCRATIC REGIME.
359	IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF BIOETHICS (1986, 1996), FORMER SENIOR EDITOR OF THE JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY H. TRISTRAM ENGELHARDT, JR. (1941-2018) RADICALLY REASSESSED THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF BIOETHICS, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THIS STILL-YOUNG FIELD THAT HE HELPED FOUND, IN LIGHT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIOHISTORICAL CONTEXT, WHICH HE ARGUED HAD BEEN INADEQUATELY CONSIDERED BY BIOETHICISTS. THIS ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY PROVIDES A SNAPSHOT OF HOW BIOETHICS IS DEVELOPING IN THE WAKE OF ENGELHARDT'S CRITIQUE. TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE THE RELATION BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND US HEALTHCARE POLICY, THE RELATION BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND CONSENT, THE ROLE OF RIGHTS IN BIOETHICAL DISCOURSE, THE DEBATE BETWEEN NATURALISM AND NORMATIVISM IN THE THEORY OF DISEASE, AND THE QUESTION OF WHEN HUMAN INDIVIDUALS BEGIN TO EXIST. ALTHOUGH NO SINGLE THEME EXPLICITLY UNITES THEM, THE PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE WERE PRODUCED WITHIN AND ARE FRUITFULLY READ IN TERMS OF WHAT ENGELHARDT INFLUENTIALLY CHARACTERIZED AS A MORALLY PLURALISTIC POSTMODERNITY SUBSISTING AMIDST THE RUINS OF TRADITION. IN THE CONCLUSION, I INTRODUCE A FURTHER WRINKLE INTO THIS ENGELHARDTIAN PICTURE-NAMELY, THE LOOMING DANGER OF A MORE GENERAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL PLURALISM EFFECTED BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DEEPFAKES.
360	THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE WILL REDOUND TO THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY CONSIDERING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROMOTION OF A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE GREATER DEMAND FOR A CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE REGULATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. IN THE HIGH COURT CASE OF EARTHLIFE AFRICA JOHANNESBURG V MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND OTHERS, THE COURT CONSIDERED WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE THABAMETSI POWER PROJECT ON THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND THE CHANGING CLIMATE WILL BE IF IT IS OPERATED TO THE EXPECTED YEAR OF 2060. THIS JUDGEMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE, PLACE, AND PRINCIPLES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAW THAT HAS ITS FOUNDING PRINCIPLES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996. THE THABAMETSI-CASE CONTRIBUTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION IN THE MANNER AS TO HOW EQUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE COURT. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE THE ADVANCES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION IN A JURISDICTION WHERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) REGULATIONS CURRENTLY REFER TO CLIMATE CHANGE EXPLICITLY.
361	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE IF WORKERS IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES HAVE BEEN WINNERS OR LOSERS OF GLOBALISATION. WE BASE OUR KEY ARGUMENT ON THE POSTULATES OF THE HECKSCHER-OHLIN MODEL, WHEREBY COUNTRIES BENEFIT FROM THE PRODUCTION AND EXPORT OF THE GOOD PRODUCED WITH THE ABUNDANT FACTOR OF PRODUCTION. WE ANALYSE THE PERIOD 1996-2016 IN 25 TRANSITION ECONOMIES OF CENTRAL, SOUTHEAST EUROPE AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES. GLOBALISATION IS REPRESENTED THROUGH THE MANUFACTURING EXPORT AND FDI IN GDP AND IS ARGUED TO BE ENDOGENOUS, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, TO WORKERS' CONDITIONS. POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE USED AS EXCLUSION RESTRICTIONS. WE RELY ON THE CONDITIONAL MIXED PROCESS PROCEDURE TO ESTIMATE THE COEFFICIENTS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WORKERS IN CENTRAL EUROPEAN TRANSITION ECONOMIES ARE THE WINNERS OF GLOBALISATION AS IT CREATED MAINLY HIGH-SKILL AND WELL-PAID JOBS. WORKERS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES ARE THE LOSERS OF GLOBALISATION WHICH LIKELY HAPPENED THROUGH REDUCING WAGES, OFFERING INADEQUATE WORKING CONDITIONS AND DAMPENING MARKETPLACE BARGAINING POWER. FINALLY, WORKERS IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE STAND IN THE MIDDLE: THEY ARE WINNERS AS GLOBALISATION CREATED EXPANDED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM, BUT LOSERS IN THE SENSE OF WORKPLACE STRUCTURE AND WAGES.
362	ADOPTING A DEFINITION OF STATE CRIME AS DEVIANCE, RATHER THAN INTERNATIONAL CRIME COMMITTED BY STATES, THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EVALUATES THE LIMITS OF LAW AND THE EFFICACY OF THE ROME STATUTE IN DELIVERING THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT'S MANDATE. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE REPLICATION OF DOMESTIC CRIMINAL JUSTICE RESPONSES- CRIME DEFINED BY THE STATE, AN EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUAL CULPABILITY, RELIANCE ON DETERRENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW - IS UNSUITABLE FOR CONCEIVING AND TACKLING STATE CRIMINALITY AT A SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL. STATES MAY EVADE THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT AND EXPLOIT DELAYS CAUSED BY THE COURTS' FORMAL RULES OF PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE. THEY MAY ALSO DEPEND ON THE NON-COOPERATION OF STATE PARTIES TO BRING PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE AND THE LACK OF POLITICAL UNITY WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL. WITH INCREASING RESORT TO DOMESTIC COURTS AND NATIONAL AGENCIES TO CLOSE THE IMPUNITY GAP, IT IS TIMELY TO REVISIT THE COURT'S MANDATE, TO CLARIFY ITS FUNCTION AS A SUPRANATIONAL REGULATOR IN RESPECT OF A LIMITED RANGE OF OFFENCES, RATHER THAN THE DECISIVE METHOD OF ENDING IMPUNITY FOR STATE CRIME THAT SOME HAVE CLAIMED AND FOR WHICH OTHERS HAD HOPED.
363	TO THE DELIGHT OF WESTPHALIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW PLURALISTS, RECENT DECISIONS BY NATIONAL AND REGIONAL COURTS HAVE SHARPLY CHALLENGED THE AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TRIBUNALS. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, IN MEDELLIN (2008), REJECTED THE POWER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) TO STICK ITS OWN PROVISIONAL MEASURES IN THE WHEELS OF TEXAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IN THE FAMOUS KADI CASE (2008), THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) CHALLENGED THE APPLICABILITY OF SECURITY COUNCIL ANTI-TERRORISM SANCTIONS FOR THEIR VIOLATION OF EUROPEAN FUNDAMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE RIGHTS. MORE RECENTLY (2014), THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT REJECTED THE ICJ'S DECISION REQUIRING ITALY TO RESPECT THE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMARY LAW PROTECTION OF GERMANY'S SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL CLAIMS BROUGHT IN ITALIAN COURTS. SUCH NATIONAL DISOBEDIENCE POSES A CHALLENGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALIST IDEAL, BY WHICH STATE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW IS ASSUMED TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. BUT NOT ALL EXPRESSIONS OF NATIONAL DISOBEDIENCE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE HOMOLOGOUS, AND THIS PAPER WILL DEFEND A KIND OF LIMITED, "CIVIL" DISOBEDIENCE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHERE NATIONAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, ULTIMATELY INTERNATIONAL IN CHARACTER, ARE AT STAKE.
364	RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TYPICALLY INCLUDE A PREFERENCE FOR FORMAL OR STATE LAW OVER INFORMAL OR CUSTOMARY LAW. IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION INITIATIVES, FORMAL COURT-BASED ADJUDICATION IS REGARDED AS THE PROCESS MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAINLY AS PREFERABLE TO LESS FORMAL MECHANISMS SUCH AS MEDIATION. THIS ARTICLE COMPARES FORMAL AND INFORMAL METHODS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THE TRAJECTORIES OF ADJUDICATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND MEDIATION IN CHINA. WHEREAS ADJUDICATION SEEKS GENERALLY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH JUSTICE, UNDERSTOOD IN CLASSICAL WESTERN THOUGHT AS THE RENDERING TO EACH WHAT IS DUE, INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS ORIENTED MORE TOWARDS THE COMMON GOOD, UNDERSTOOD CLASSICALLY AS THE MAINTENANCE OF A PEACEFUL SOCIAL ORDER THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PURSUE THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE GOALS IN COMMUNITY. THESE CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE AND THE COMMON GOOD ARE NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL BUT THEIR IDEOLOGIES PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION DISCOURSE IN BOTH THE US AND CHINA. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH OF THESE JURISDICTIONS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL PLURALIST OR "HYBRID" DISPUTE RESOLUTION SYSTEMS, A SUGGESTION THAT SPEAKS AGAINST ANY GENERAL OR FIXED PREFERENCE IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION INITIATIVES FOR FORMAL OVER INFORMAL PROCESSES.
365	WHEN DEALING WITH OTTOMAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES, FRANKISH MERCHANTS, DIPLOMATS, AND EVEN SLAVES ENCOUNTERED UNEXPECTED DIFFICULTIES. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES THESE FOREIGNERS CAME UP AGAINST WAS THE OTTOMAN WITNESS SYSTEM, PRIVILEGING THE WORD OF MUSLIMS, AND MORE GENERALLY, ISLAMIC NOTIONS OF PROOF AND EVIDENCE. IN THIS ARTICLE I REPORT THE STORY OF A VENETIAN WHO FELL BANKRUPT IN SYRIA IN THE 1520S, AND ANALYZE HOW HIS DEFAULT WAS DEALT WITH BY OTTOMAN JUDGES. A TRADER IN DIAMONDS AND LUXURY ITEMS, MARCO PRIULI'S HEIRS AND ASSOCIATES PROVED TO BE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE LEGAL PRACTICES SPONSORED BY THE OTTOMANS, AND WITH THE COURT'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PROOF AND EVIDENCE. BY APPROACHING PRIULI'S CASE, I DESCRIBE HOW, SHORTLY AFTER THE OTTOMAN CONQUEST OF SYRIA AND EGYPT, JUDGES AND OFFICIALS STARTED TO DEVIATE FROM PREVIOUS LEGAL PRACTICE REGARDING NON-MUSLIMS AND MIXED CASES, PROMOTING THEIR OWN PRACTICES FOR PRODUCING EVIDENCE. FOR THE OTTOMANS, THE NEW APPROACH TO PROOF AND EVIDENCE SERVED AS A MEANS TO DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES AS A POLITICAL COMMUNITY, AND TO MARK OUT THEIR VISION OF THE OTTOMAN SOVEREIGN AS GUARANTOR OF THE RULE OF LAW.
366	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WORKINGS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN POST-WAR ANGOLA THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORY AND CURRENT FUNCTIONING OF RESIDENTS' COMMITTEES AT NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL IN PERI-URBAN LUANDA, BASED ON CASE-STUDY RESEARCH IN THE ZANGO HOUSING PROJECT. WHILE RECOGNISING THAT POWER IN ANGOLA IS HIGHLY CENTRALISED, AND THE AUTONOMY OF REGULAR STATE STRUCTURES LIMITED, IT ARGUES THAT, WHEN POWER IS STUDIED FROM BELOW, STATE OFFICIALS AND THOSE THEY ENGAGE WITH CAN BE SEEN TO PRODUCE, RECOGNISE AND NEGOTIATE PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN MULTIPLE WAYS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL HISTORY. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO BRING A SENSE OF HISTORY AND AGENCY TO WHAT IS COMMONLY SEEN BY SCHOLARS AS A TOP-DOWN AND REPRESSIVE PROJECT OF STATE-BUILDING. YET THE TWILIGHT EXISTENCE OF RESIDENTS' COMMITTEES - AS INSTITUTIONS THAT FUNCTION, BUT ARE NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED, AS PART OF THE STATE - ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE DEEPLY AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF THIS ENDEAVOUR AS ONE THAT, ALTHOUGH FORMALLY AIMED AT BUILDING A DEMOCRATIC STATE THAT FOLLOWS THE RULE OF LAW, CONTINUES TO BE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN INFORMAL PRACTICES THAT ULTIMATELY SERVE TO PRESERVE THE RULING PARTY'S HOLD ON POWER.
367	RESEARCH ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES HAS MOSTLY REACHED DEPRESSINGLY SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS - THAT SUCH TREATIES AND THEIR RESULTING INSTITUTIONS HAVE LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS. THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, HOWEVER, POSSESSES SIGNIFICANT POWER TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT EQUIP IT WITH POTENTIALLY MORE INFLUENCE THAN PREVIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS REGIMES. I SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT THE IMPACT OF THE ICC ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS CONDITIONED BY SIGNATORY GOVERNMENTS' COMMITMENT TO GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE ICC IN ADDRESSING VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. I DEVELOP A TWO-STAGE MODEL OF ICC RATIFICATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE THAT SHOWS THAT WHILE MANY STATES HAVE RATIFIED THE ICC TREATY, NOT ALL ARE COMMITTED TO STOPPING THE CRIMES UNDER ITS JURISDICTION. RATHER, STATE COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS DEPENDS FIRST ON ITS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN ITS OWN BORDERS. SECOND, COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS DEPENDS ON STATES' WILLINGNESS TO GRANT THE ICC THE POWERS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT ITS MISSION. THROUGH A NUMBER OF STATISTICAL TESTS, I FIND STRONG SUPPORT FOR THESE HYPOTHESES ON STATES' HUMAN RIGHTS AND PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENCE.
368	INTENSIFYING PROCESSES OF GLOBALIZATION HAVE LED TO A SERIES OF TENSIONS AROUND THE WAY IN WHICH EVEN THE MOST COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACIES NOW TREAT PEOPLE WHO MOVE ACROSS THEIR BORDERS. NON-CITIZENS HAVE BECOME PROBLEMS. THE POSTCOLONIAL SETTLER NATION-STATES - AUSTRALIA, CANADA, THE USA AND OTHERS - WERE 'FOUNDED' BY IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES WHO MOVED GLOBALLY TO BECOME CITIZENS IN THESE 'NEW LANDS'. SUCH COUNTRIES WERE MADE BY MIGRANTS DISPLACING INDIGENOUS OTHERS. HOWEVER, IN A CONFLICT-RIDDEN WORLD IN WHICH THE DISPLACEMENT OF PERSONS HAS BECOME ENDEMIC - AND IN A MEDIA-CONNECTED WORLD WHERE THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMAGINABLE AND DESIRED - THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOW ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE THAT GLOBAL FLOW OF PEOPLE BY STRINGENT HOMELAND SECURITY MEASURES THAT ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY PROBLEMATIC. WHILE THEY ARE CONSTITUTED THROUGH THE MODERN IMAGINARY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC NORMS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW, IN EACH COUNTRY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, RULES HAVE BEEN BENT, BREACHED OR BOLSTERED IN ORDER TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT. THE ESSAY ARGUES THAT GIVEN THE GLOBALIZATION OF PEOPLE MOVEMENT, THE NATION-STATE HAS REACHED THE LIMITS OF RESPONDING THOUGH UNILATERAL OR EVEN REGIONAL MULTILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS.
369	IN POST-2000 ZIMBABWE, THE RULE OF LAW WAS UNDERMINED AS ZANU(PF) DISMISSED THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS LAND REFORM PROGRAMME. THE ASSUMPTIONS OF DISORDER AND A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH THAT MARK UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE POSTCOLONIAL AFRICAN STATE MAY THUS APPEAR APPROPRIATE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE NEGOTIATION OF POWER AND AUTHORITY WITHIN THE ZIMBABWEAN STATE. A FOCUS ON A POLITICS OF DISORDER DOES NOT, HOWEVER, FURTHER OUR INSIGHTS INTO THE PRACTICAL AND CONCEPTUAL PLACE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ZIMBABWE. EXAMINING THE DYNAMICS WITHIN ONE STATE INSTITUTION, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, I EXPLORE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH, THE OFFICE WAS POLITICISED, AND HOW THOSE WORKING IN OR WITH THE OFFICE MADE SENSE OF THIS PROCESS. OFFICIALS INVOKED TWO REGISTERS, ONE OF CORRUPTION AND POLITICISATION AND ANOTHER OF PROFESSIONALISM AND JUSTICE', TO EXPLAIN THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH, AND EXPECTATIONS OF, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THESE VIEWS HIGHLIGHT THE CENTRALITY OF CONTESTATIONS OVER THE NATURE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE IMAGINATION OF ZIMBABWE'S STATE BY CIVIL SERVANTS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY DEMONSTRATING A WEAKENED, DISORDERED, OR HOLLOWED-OUT STATE INSTITUTION.
370	THIS ESSAY APPLIES THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTS OF PURE WAR AND SPEED-POLITICS DEVELOPED BY THE CRITICAL THEORIST AND URBANIST PAUL VIRILIO TO THE CONCEPT OF POWER CRIME. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT READERS UNFAMILIAR WITH VIRILIO'S WORK WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY OF GREAT POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY. IT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO MAJOR PARTS. THE FIRST PART RE-CONSIDERS POWER CRIME AND THE BROADER CRIMINOGENIC ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF THE VIRILIAN NOTIONS OF VELOCITY, OPTICS, AND PURE WAR: CRIMINOGENIC PHENOMENA ARE SHOWN TO BE THE NECESSARY AND UNAVOIDABLE BY-PRODUCTS OF THE WIDER CONVERGENCES AMONG POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MILITARY SYSTEMS GOVERNED BY SPEED. THE SECOND PART CONSISTS OF AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY ILLUSTRATING THE PRACTICAL APPLICABILITY OF THESE ABSTRACT VIRILIAN CONCEPTS: THE FEDERAL PROSECUTION OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM CUSTER BATTLES FOR FRAUD. THE SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION OF THE US MILITARY PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND THE INABILITY OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO PROVIDE A REMEDY FOR THE FRAUD PERPETRATED AGAINST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS READ AS A KEY SIGN OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE LIBERAL JURO-POLITICAL ORDER AND THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF THE RULE OF LAW BY FAST MOVING, OR "HIGH VELOCITY", CRIMINOGENIC PROCESSES.
371	BAIL BOND AGENTS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS ARE INTEGRAL FIGURES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEIR JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM JAIL ON BAIL RETURNS TO COURT FOR HIS OR HER SCHEDULED COURT APPEARANCE. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING BAIL BOND AGENTS AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTED BOUNTY HUNTERS, AS WELL AS THE EXTRA-LEGAL VIOLENCE AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY THEM. THIS LEGAL ANALYSIS IS DEVELOPED BY EXAMINING STATE COURT DECISIONS DATING BACK TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY TRENDS IN THE LAW ARE ILLUSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE ARTICLE WITH RESPECT TO BAIL BOND AGENTS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS. USING INDUCTIVE LEGAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, THE CASES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO CONSTITUTIONAL AREAS, OUTLINING THE TYPES OF ISSUES STATE COURTS LITIGATE: THE LEGITIMACY/LEGALITY OF ARRESTS AND BAIL BOND AGENTS ENTERING THIRD-PARTY RESIDENCES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT ALTHOUGH BAIL AGENTS AND BOUNTY HUNTERS HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED IN THE PAST FOR EXERCISING THEIR EXTRA-LEGAL AUTHORITY, STATE STATUTES AND STATE COURT CASES HAVE MODIFIED THE BAIL BOND SYSTEM, RENDERING IT MORE AMENABLE TO THE RULE OF LAW.

372	IN THIS PAPER, WE REVISIT AND EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. TO THIS END, WE EXPLOIT THE CRACKDOWN OF GOVERNMENT CABINET IN 2008 THAT LED TO ALMOST TWO DECADES OF PERVASIVE POLITICAL INSTABILITY USING THE UNIQUE CASE OF SLOVENIA AND ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND THE MISSING COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2020. BASED ON LARGE-SCALE BAYESIAN ANALYSIS WITH METROPOLIS-HASTINGS ALGORITHM, WE EXTRACT THE RESIDUAL COMPONENT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY FROM THE VARIATION IN PREDETERMINED UNOBSERVED CHARACTERISTICS. ACROSS MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION SEQUENCED RANDOM SAMPLES, WE CONSTRUCT NOVEL TIME-VARYING ESTIMATES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL. OUR DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES AND SYNTHETIC CONTROL ESTIMATES EMPHASIZE A RAMPANT DETERIORATION OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN RESPONSE TO POLITICAL INSTABILITY WITH EVIDENCE OF WEAKENED RULE OF LAW, LESS EFFECTIVE PUBLIC SECTOR, DECREASED POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND MORE WIDESPREAD PREVALENCE OF POWER ABUSES. THE ESTIMATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY ARE ROBUST TO A VARIETY OF PLACEBO CHECKS ACROSS MORE THAN 12 BILLION PLACEBO AVERAGES FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OUTCOME VARIABLE USING RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD OF TREATMENT PERMUTATION.
373	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT OF MILITARY LAW. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY WAS THE USE OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH METHODS, THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOGICAL RESEARCH TECHNIQUES. THE RESEARCH WAS BASED ON SEVERAL CERTAINTIES: THE FIRST SYSTEMIC CERTAINTY IS THE LIMITED OR CONDITIONAL COMMITMENT OF SOME STATES TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE SECOND SYSTEMIC CERTAINTY IS THE STATE PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. THE THIRD IS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS. THE FOURTH SYSTEMIC CERTAINTY IS THAT HORROR IN THE CONTEXT OF ARMED CONFLICT IS PRESENT AND THAT WAR IS ALWAYS A HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE. FINALLY, THE FIFTH SYSTEMIC CERTAINTY IS THE DEFENSIBILITY OF A STATE IN POSSESSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR MODERN POLICE PRACTICE, I.E., TO ENACT MILITARY LAW DIRECTLY. BASED ON THE IDEA THAT MILITARY JUSTICE IS A SYSTEM OF ORGANS, IT SHOULD INCLUDE: AN ORGAN THAT CONDUCTS PRE-TRIAL INVESTIGATION OR ENSURES LAW AND ORDER AND AN ORGAN THAT MONITORS THE RULE OF LAW; MILITARY COURTS.
374	SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS ARE SITUATIONS THAT EXEMPLIFY HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS CAUSED BY EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES. THESE ARE PRESENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE EXTRACTIVISM, IMPERIALISM, AND COLONIALISM PARADIGMS PREVAIL. IN THE CONTEXT OF MEXICO, CRIMINALIZATION, VIOLENCE, AND THE ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTE THESE CONFLICTS, FREQUENTLY AGGRAVATED BY INVOLVEMENT WITH PRIVATE INTERESTS. IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE MINING SECTOR AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN A CRITICAL RESEARCH SUBJECT. THIS PAPER AIMS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TO ANALYZE HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS RELATED TO THE MINING INDUSTRY'S IMPACT IN MEXICO, AND IDENTIFY FACTORS CAUSING SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS. THE CURRENT STUDY SHOWS A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS BASED ON THE PRISMA (PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES) METHODOLOGY. THIS METHOD CONTRIBUTED TO THE COLLECTION OF REFERENCES THAT DESCRIBE CONFLICTS DUE TO HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE IN MINING AREAS IN MEXICO. HUMAN RIGHTS TRANSGRESSIONS CAUSED BY MINING IN A MEXICAN CONTEXT DEMONSTRATE THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO STOP THE INCREASE IN SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS AND ITS LACK OF CONCERN TOWARDS PREVENTING DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
375	THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ), THE MAIN JUDICIAL BODY OF THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS EFFORTS TO BUILD UP THE RULE OF LAW ON A GLOBAL SCALE. THE ICJ HAS DEALT WITH ISSUES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN CASES BROUGHT BEFORE IT, AND IN THE 21ST CENTURY, BEGAN TO ENDORSE A MORE ACTIVE APPROACH IN THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THIS IS APPARENT IN SEVERAL JUDGMENTS SINCE THE EARLY 2000S ON THE PROTECTION OF CERTAIN CONSULAR RIGHTS. THE RELEVANT CASES ARE LAGRAND, AVENA AND OTHERS, AND JADHAV, THE LATTER BEING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT JUDGMENTS OF THE ICJ. IN THIS ARTICLE, THESE CASES ARE EXAMINED IN DETAIL, TO ILLUSTRATE THE ABOVEMENTIONED TENDENCY OF THE ICJ. IN PARTICULAR, THE DIFFERENT AND MORE PROGRESSIVE ASPECTS OF THE JADHAV JUDGMENT COMPARED TO THE LAGRAND AND AVENA JUDGMENTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROVE THE EVOLVING APPROACH OF THE ICJ IN TERMS OF ACTIVELY PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, THROUGH A COMPARISON OF THREE SIMILAR CASES WHERE IT DEALT WITH THE VIOLATION OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.
376	THIS PAPER OFFERS A NOVEL SITUATIONAL APPROACH TO STUDY ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE IN WHICH THE PROPOSED UNIT OF ANALYSIS IS MANAGERIAL BEHAVIOR MANIFESTED IN ARGUMENTATION RATHER THAN EMPLOYEE JUSTICE PERCEPTIONS. THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IN JUSTICE RESEARCH, WHICH IS BUILT ON JUSTICE PERCEPTIONS, NEGLECTS THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF ORGANIZATIONAL ORDER AND VULNERABILITY OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PERCEPTIONS. AS THE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE CONCEPT BELONGS CHIEFLY TO A SPONTANEOUS MARKET ORDER UNDER WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS MADE POSSIBLE, IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER THIS CONCEPT TO AN ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE RULE OF AUTHORITY IS DOMINANT. THEREFORE, EXCEPT THE LIMITED LEGAL DOMAIN IN WHICH MANAGERIAL FREEDOM IS RESTRAINED BY LAWS, PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IN ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTS A MIRAGE THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO HYPOCRITICAL MANAGERIAL ACTIONS THAT CAN LEGITIMATE MORALLY CONTROVERSIAL OUTCOMES VIA ERISTIC TACTICS. IN CONTRAST, INTERACTIONAL JUSTICE IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ORGANIZATIONS IN THAT EMPLOYEES AND ORGANIZATIONS CAN ENSURE THEIR RATIONAL ECONOMIC EXCHANGES WITHOUT DECEPTION. HOWEVER, CURRENT FORMULATIONS OF INTERACTIONAL JUSTICE OFTEN REGARD INTERACTIONS AS A PALLIATIVE RECIPE DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE REACTIONS TO OUTCOMES AND NOT AS A CONSTITUENT OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. PERELMAN'S ARGUMENTATION THEORY CAN OFFER A NEW CONCEPTUALIZATION OF INTERACTIONAL JUSTICE THAT ADDRESSES THIS GAP.
377	ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL OF MODERN GOVERNMENT, BUT THEIR LEGITIMACY IS OFTEN QUESTIONED SINCE THEY ARE ADOPTED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RATHER THAN THE LEGISLATURE. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE LEGALITY OF REGULATIONS IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT AS AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM BECAUSE JUDICIAL REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO MANY PRACTICAL AND LEGAL SHORTCOMINGS, ESPECIALLY INCLUDING ITS HIGH COST. CONSEQUENTLY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF REGULATIONS ARE NEVER SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHICH CREATES AN ACCOUNTABILITY DEFICIT. THIS DEFICIT CAN BE REMEDIED THROUGH EX ANTE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF THE LEGALITY OF REGULATIONS BY AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE ADOPTING AGENCY. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES EXECUTIVE BRANCH EX ANTE LEGALITY REVIEW SCHEMES IN CALIFORNIA, CHILE, ISRAEL, AND FRANCE. ALTHOUGH THESE REGULATORY REVIEW SCHEMES VARY GREATLY, EACH OF THEM SCRUTINIZES THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LEGALITY OF REGULATIONS (AS DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR ECONOMIC OR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT OR THEIR POLITICAL ACCEPTABILITY). THIS REVIEW TAKES PLACE BEFORE THE REGULATIONS ARE JUDICIALLY REVIEWED AND BEFORE THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE. EX ANTE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW CAN COMPENSATE FOR THE FAILINGS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, AND ENHANCE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS.
378	THE PAPER PRESENTS AN INVESTIGATION OF LEGAL NORMS, MAINLY INVOLVING MATTERS OF LEGITIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW. IT WORKS WITH THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: HOW LEGAL NORMS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD UNDER THE RULE OF LAW? DIFFERENT THEORIES PROPOSED A VARIETY OF MODELS TO UNDERSTAND LEGAL NORMS. FREDERICK SCHAUER'S CONTEMPORARY LEGAL POSITIVISM IS AN EXAMPLE. THE PRESENT WORK INTENDS TO FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PATH, SEARCHING FOR OTHER SOURCES TO UNDERSTAND LEGAL NORMS. FROM THE WORKS OF JOHN SEARLE, IT INTENDS TO SEE LEGAL NORMS AS PROMISES. IN ORDER TO REDUCE SOCIAL CONFLICTS TO AN OPTIMUM LEVEL, IT IS NECESSARY TO OFFER A PROMISE OF MANAGEMENT, WHICH COMPRISES CERTAIN EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW (FORMAL ERADICATION OF PRIVILEGES). IT IS NECESSARY TO THINK ABOUT THE PRODUCTION OF LEGAL TEXTS (THE CONSTITUTION, FOR INSTANCE) BY THOSE WHO TAKE OVER, BY ANY MEANS, THE POWER TO DO SO. BEYOND MECHANISMS PROPOSED IN LEGAL TEXTS, TENDING TO ESTABLISH A FORMAL EQUITY (LIKE THOSE OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND SOCIAL RIGHTS), IN A SYSTEM OF POWER MANAGED BY GOVERNMENTS IT IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN LEGITIMACY THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC PERSECUTION OF PROMISES MADE (BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER) IN THOSE TEXTS.
379	ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE, PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND METAL DETECTORISTS TESTIFY THAT SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES HAVE BEEN EMPTIED OF METAL OBJECTS, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO COMBAT ILLICIT TRAFFICKING OF CULTURAL OBJECTS. YET THERE IS LITTLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WITHIN COUNTRIES OR ITS COMPARATIVE SCALE BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN THE REGION. THIS PAPER PRESENTS OPEN-SOURCE ANALYSIS OF MEMBERSHIP OF ONLINE FORUMS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS, AS WELL AS OTHER EMPIRICAL INDICATORS, SUCH AS SALES AND OWNERSHIP OF METAL DETECTORS. IT IDENTIFIES AND CONTRADICTS SPECULATION AND PROPAGANDA FROM ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND DETECTORISTS, THEN OFFERS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IN THEIR PLACE. IT SUGGESTS THE ACTIVITY OF AT LEAST 14,910 ILLICIT DETECTORISTS IN BELARUS (AROUND 1 IN 638 RESIDENTS), 54,066 ILLICIT DETECTORISTS IN POLAND (AROUND 1 IN 702 RESIDENTS), 26,377 ILLICIT DETECTORISTS IN UKRAINE (AROUND 1 IN 1706 RESIDENTS) AND 75,158 ILLICIT DETECTORISTS IN RUSSIA (AROUND 1 IN 1921 RESIDENTS). IT SUGGESTS THAT, IN MANY OF THE WORST-AFFECTED COMMUNITIES, ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TECHNICALITIES OF PERMISSIVE, RESTRICTIVE, OR PROHIBITIVE REGULATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE PRESERVATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE MAY BE THE ECONOMY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
380	IN SEPTEMBER 2015 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE SDGS AND ALL OVER THE WORLD THE EXPECTATIONS FOCUSED ON THE NEW UN DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. APPARENTLY, ISSUES CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN SECURITY, INCLUDING ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, PROMOTION OF SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTIONS, HAVE BEEN STRONGLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT DURING NEGOTIATIONS. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE SDGS GO FAR BEYOND MDGS WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING A DEEP CONNECTION WITH HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. NONETHELESS, THE REFERENCES MADE TO HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT ARE WEAK AND FRAGMENTED. MOREOVER, THE SDG 16, FOCUSED ON SECURITY ANDPROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, IS NOT TIME-BOUND AND DOES NOT INCLUDE CLEAR INDICATORS RELATED TO ITS TARGETS. IN THE LIGHT OF THIS, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE GRADE OF REAL RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY ISSUES IN THE POST-2015 AGENDA AND TO SUGGEST POSSIBLE INDICATORS FOR SDG 16 TARGETS BASED ON JURIDICAL INSTRUMENTS. FOR THIS REASON CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SDGS AND EXISTING HUMAN RIGHTS BINDING NORMS WILL BE ASSESSED IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE INCLUSION OF EXPLICIT REFERENCES TO CORE TREATIES IN THE ABOVE-MENTIONED INDICATORS COULD PROMOTE A MORE EFFECTIVE MONITORING.
381	WHILE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IS GENERALLY ASSUMED TO REPRESENT LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE REAL ECONOMY, APPROXIMATELY 30-50 PERCENT OF GLOBAL FDI IS ACCOUNTED FOR BY NETWORKS OF OFFSHORE SHELL COMPANIES CREATED BY CORPORATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS FOR TAX AND OTHER PURPOSES. TO DATE, THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH ON THE GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF THESE NETWORKS. HERE WE ADDRESS THIS GAP BY EMPLOYING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO DECOMPOSE THE GLOBAL BILATERAL FDI ANOMALY MATRIX INTO ITS PRIMARY CONSTITUENT SUBNETWORKS. WE FIND THAT THE GLOBAL OFFSHORE FDI NETWORK IS HIGHLY GLOBALIZED, WITH A CENTRALIZED CORE OF JURISDICTIONS IN NORTHWEST EUROPE AND THE CARIBBEAN EXERCISING A LARGELY HOMOGENOUS WORLDWIDE INFLUENCE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE NETWORK IS INTERNALLY DIFFERENTIATED, THIS APPEARS TO PRIMARILY REFLECT A HISTORIC LAYERING OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS. WE IDENTIFY FOUR PRIMARY OFFSHORE FDI SUBNETWORKS, BEARING THE IMPRINT OF FOUR KEY PROCESSES AND EVENTS: EUROPEAN, PARTICULARLY UK COLONIALISM, THE POST-WWII HEGEMONIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN EUROPE, THE FALL OF SOVIET COMMUNISM, AND THE RISE OF CHINESE CAPITALISM. WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE OF QUALITATIVE, BUT NOT QUANTITATIVE, VARIATION IN OFFSHORE FDI BASED ON NATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND COMMUNIST HISTORY.
382	THE NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF 1994 ESTABLISHED SOUTH AFRICA AS A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. UNDER NELSON MANDELA, THE NEW DEMOCRACY BASKED IN A GLOW OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, EARLY GROWTH, AND OPTIMISM. SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL SENSE OF COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING HAS DECLINED. RACIAL INEQUALITY HAS NARROWED, BUT THE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE APARTHEID ECONOMY REMAIN, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT SECTION OF THE POPULATION LIVING IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY, DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO COMBINE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH REDISTRIBUTION. GIVEN THE CONTINUED ENTRENCHMENT OF WHITE ECONOMIC POWER, THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (ANC) HAS SOUGHT TO USE ITS CAPTURE OF THE STATE TO PROMOTE THE EMPOWERMENT OF BLACKS. HOWEVER, HAVING ASSUMED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A "DOMINANT PARTY" ASSURED OF SUCCESSIVE ELECTION VICTORIES, THE ANC NOW PRESIDES OVER A PARTY-STATE WHOSE ACCOUNTABILITY LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED, PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY AND SCOPE FOR CORRUPT AND PREDATORY BEHAVIOR BY SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF THE PARTY'S ELITE. FURTHER MERGING OF PARTY AND STATE CHALLENGES CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS ONLY WHEN THE ANC'S ELECTORAL HEGEMONY IS ERODED THAT WE WILL DISCOVER WHETHER, IF FACED BY LOSS OF POWER, IT WILL OBEY OR DISREGARD ITS DEMOCRATIC HERITAGE.
383	GIVEN CHINA'S RECORD OF SUPPRESSING FREEDOMS AND BRUTALISING NATIONALISTICALLY-DISTINCT TERRITORIES IN ITS MIDST, THE ALARM OF HONG KONG'S 1997 STATUS CHANGE FROM BRITISH TO CHINESE ASSOCIATION WAS ESPECIALLY SHRILL. AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF CHINESE ASSOCIATION, SOME SCHOLARS REMAIN PESSIMISTIC. SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AS IF "BY A THOUSAND CUTS'' HONG KONG'S AUTONOMOUS POWERS WILL SLOWLY SUCCUMB TO FULL CHINESE POLITICAL ASSIMILATION. OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT HONG KONG'S AUTONOMY IS ALREADY DEAD AND REMAINS VULNERABLE TO THE UNILATERAL FIAT OF CHINESE AUTHORITIES. BY CONTRAST TO THESE VIEWS, THIS PAPER WILL ARGUE THAT HONG KONG IS A POLITY WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IS DEFENDED BY POLITICAL ENTRENCHMENT. IT IS A PARTIALLY INDEPENDENT POLITICAL ENTITY WHICH EXERCISES CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS THAT ARE ROBUSTLY DEFENDED BY THE POLITICAL-ECONOMIC INFLUENCE (RATHER THAN CONSTITUTIONAL INFLUENCE) WHICH IT EXERTS UPON CHINA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. AS THIS PAPER WILL SHOW, THE FORTUNES OF CHINA'S LEADERS ARE LINKED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF HONG KONG'S ECONOMY. AND SINCE THE TERRITORY'S ECONOMY RESTS UPON THE PILLARS OF ITS AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTIONS, PRESS FREEDOM, RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, THIS PREVENTS MAXIMALIST INTERFERENCE FROM BEIJING.
384	THIS PAPER EXPLORES TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS A WAY TO BRING AN END TO VIOLENCE AND CONSOLIDATE PEACE. IT APPROACHES TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE 'NEVER AGAIN' CONSENSUS TO PREVENT OR PROSECUTE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. IT EXPLORES TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS AN EXPRESSION OF GLOBALIZING LAW AND THE IMPLICATIONS THIS HAS FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'POLITICAL LEGITIMACY' IN THE POST CONFLICT STATE. IT TAKES ROBERT MEISTER (2002)'S FORMULATION OF THE POLITICS OF VICTIMHOOD, REVENGE AND RESENTMENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BENEFICIARIES AND THE VICTIMS OF INJUSTICE, AS REMAINING AT THE CENTRE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE POLITICS IN TRYING TO DECIDE ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN RECONCILIATION AND JUSTICE PROJECTS. IT EXPLORES HOW HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE HAS BEEN USED TO DE-POLITICISE THE 'VICTIM' BY ADOPTING AN INDIVIDUALLY EMBODIED CONCEPT OF VIOLENCE AS OPPOSED TO A STRUCTURAL ONE. IT ARGUES THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS AN EXPRESSION OF GLOBALIZING LAW HAS BEEN PRIMARILY DIRECTED AT MAINTAINING PEACE TO ACHIEVE CLOSURE ON PAST 'EVIL' BUT THAT THE BENEFICIARY-VICTIM ISSUE HAS RE-EMERGED IN THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS AND RENEWED DESIRE FOR PROSECUTIONS.
385	HOW MAY A SOCIETY, IN A MORALLY DEFENSIBLE WAY, CONFRONT A PAST OF INJUSTICE AND SUFFERING, AND SEEK TO BREAK THE SPELL OF VIOLENCE AND DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE? I BEGIN BY DEMONSTRATING THE RELEVANCE OF THIS QUESTION TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION, AND I DRAW ATTENTION TO ANDRE DU TOIT'S LONG-STANDING INTEREST IN WAYS IN WHICH TRUTH COMMISSIONS MAY FUNCTION TO CONSOLIDATE POLITICAL CHANGE. IN THE SECOND SECTION OF THE ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT TRUTH COMMISSIONS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A DEFENSIBLE MORAL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE VALUES OF JUSTICE AND SOCIAL UNITY, AND I CRITICIZE CLAIMS THAT TRUTH COMMISSIONS PROMOTE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, WHEN THAT IS UNDERSTOOD AS A DISTINCTIVE CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE THAT EMERGES IN CIRCUMSTANCE OF REGIME TRANSITION. IN THE THIRD SECTION, I CRITICIZE THE CLAIM THAT TRUTH COMMISSIONS ARE NOT A MORAL COMPROMISE AT ALL BUT EMBODY A SUPERIOR, RESTORATIVE CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE. I CONCLUDE BY SHOWING WHY RETRIBUTION IS REQUIRED BY CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND WHY TRUTH COMMISSIONS MUST BE SEEN, NOT AS AN END IN THEMSELVES, BUT AS INSTITUTIONS WHOSE FUNCTION IS TO EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, NORMAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND LEGAL RECOGNITION.
386	THERE ARE TWO CONTRASTING CLAIMS REGARDING THE HUNGARIAN JUDICIARY. THE GOVERNMENT ASSERTS THAT IT IS IN THE BEST SHAPE, WHILE MANY OTHER VOICES LABEL IT AS CAPTURED OR DEPENDENT. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW BOTH OF THESE CLAIMS CAN BE TRUE, DEPENDING ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN FORMALITY AND INFORMALITY AND SHOWS HOW A FEW SMALL LOOPHOLES ALLOW SOME ACTORS TO RIG THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THEREFORE, THE HUNGARIAN JUDICIARY IS SIMILAR TO SCHRODINGER'S CAT, WHICH IS CLAIMED TO BE DEAD AND ALIVE AT THE SAME TIME. THE SYNERGY BETWEEN FORMALITY AND INFORMALITY REQUIRES A NETWORK OF A HANDFUL OF TRUSTED PEOPLE IN MANAGERIAL POSITIONS TO ADMINISTER CASE ALLOCATION, PROMOTION, AND DISCIPLINARY SYSTEMS, WHICH SEEM TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE TOOLS. FEW SMALL TECHNICAL LOOPHOLES AND SOME SPECIAL REMEDIES SUFFICE TO MICROMANAGE IMPORTANT CASES PRECISELY BECAUSE KEY POSITIONS ARE CAPTURED WHICH WORK AS GATEKEEPERS OR EMERGENCY BRAKES. MOST OF THESE TOOLS ARE LEGAL IN A VERY FORMAL TECHNICAL SENSE OF THE WORD BECAUSE THEY RELY ON ACTS OF PARLIAMENT. A FORMAL LEGALISM, A VERY THIN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND A MAJORITARIAN MINDSET SERVE AS A LEGITIMIZING IDEOLOGY FOR THE WHOLE LEGAL SYSTEM.
387	WHETHER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN IMPACT ON COUNTRIES' ECONOMIC GROWTH PERFORMANCES IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RESEARCH TOPICS DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE. FORMER SOCIALIST CENTRAL ASIAN AND CAUCASIAN COUNTRIES TRYING TO ADAPT INTO MARKET ECONOMY HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED THEIR TRANSITION PROCESSES, BUT THEY HAVE MANAGED TO GROW THEIR ECONOMIES IN COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS PERIODS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GROWTH PERFORMANCES AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN AND CAUCASIAN COUNTRIES OF AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA, GEORGIA, KAZAKHSTAN, KYRGYZSTAN AND TAJIKISTAN BETWEEN THE YEARS 2000-2018 BY USING THE DECISION VARIABLES OF CIVIL RIGHTS, ECONOMIC FREEDOM, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND GDP PER CAPITA. ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS RESULTS OBTAINED VIA GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS METHOD BY ASSIGNING EQUAL IMPORTANCE TO ALL VARIABLES, KAZAKHSTAN IS FOUND TO BE THE HIGHEST-RANKING COUNTRY AMONG ALL EXAMINED COUNTRIES FOR ALL PERIODS. THE AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES THAT THESE COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN DURING THEIR MARKET ECONOMY TRANSITIONS WITH REGARDS TO MATTERS RELATED TO INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE THE REASON WHY COUNTRIES' ECONOMIC EFFORTS HAVE FAILED TO YIELD RESULTS.
388	LATE ANTIQUE POLITICAL PLATONISM WAS NOT UNORIGINAL IN ITS THOUGHT. THE PAPER TAKES AS AN EXAMPLE THE JUSTINIANIC DIALOGUE ON POLITICAL SCIENCE (CA. 550), WHICH CREATIVELY ENGAGES WITH PLATO'S POLITICAL WORKS. IT SHOWS THAT THE DIALOGUE TRIES - AND MANAGES, AS I ARGUE - TO COMBINE TWO APPARENTLY INCONSISTENT PLATONIC MODELS: WHAT I CALL THE "DIVINE" MODEL, IN WHICH A PHILOSOPHER-KING ENDOWED WITH DIVINE KNOWLEDGE RULES UNHINDERED BY CIVIC LAWS; AND THE "HUMAN" MODEL, CHARACTERIZED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE DIVINE MODEL COMES MOSTLY FROM PLATO'S REPUBLIC AND STATESMAN; THE HUMAN ONE, FROM THE LAWS. ON POLITICAL SCIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT ITS (ANONYMOUS) AUTHOR WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THESE THREE PLATONIC TEXTS, IN ADDITION TO OTHER TEXTS. THAT IS PHILOLOGICALLY NOTEWORTHY, BUT ALSO PHILOSOPHICALLY INTERESTING: THE DIALOGUE MANAGES TO INTEGRATE THE TWO MODELS INTO A COMMON FRAMEWORK. IT PUTS FORWARD AN ORIGINAL POLITICAL MODEL, IN WHICH A PHILOSOPHER-KING, ALTHOUGH ENDOWED WITH DIVINE KNOWLEDGE, STILL HAS TO BE BOUND BY CIVIC LAWS BECAUSE OF HIS HUMAN FRAILTY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING THE POLEMICAL IMPORT THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE HAD IN ITS JUSTINIANIC CONTEXT.
389	THE PAPER SEEKS TO EXAMINE WHETHER AND ON WHAT BASIS THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW APPLIES TO THE TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES, HAVING AS AN EXAMPLE THE CASES OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES FROM THE POST-SOVIET SPACE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE PAPER WILL FOCUS FIRST, ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES AND GENERAL INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW REGULATIONS. SECOND, IT WILL LOOK AT WHAT PLACE IS RESERVED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE ANALYSED TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES. IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT THESE TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES PROCLAIM THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS BY TRANSPLANTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE HUMAN RIGHTS ONES, INTO THEIR NATIONAL PROVISIONS. AFTER ANALYSING THE TWO CASE STUDIES, IT WILL BE CLAIMED THAT ALTHOUGH THE TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW NORMS AND STANDARDS, LEGAL TRANSPLANT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AND THE TERRITORIAL NON-STATE ENTITIES SHALL ENGAGE MORE AT THE PRACTICAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION ON THEIR TERRITORIES.
390	ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS DIVERSIFICATION ENHANCES MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND PROMOTES STRUCTURAL AND LONG-TERM TRANSFORMATION NOT ONLY IN THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO IN OTHER PILLARS OF DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DIMENSIONS. THERE IS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTING AN IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS ON DIVERSIFICATION. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS THE EMPLOYMENT OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES, METHODOLOGIES, COUNTRIES, AND PERIODS. THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY EXPLORES THE RELATIONS DRIVING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION IN 14 RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2001 AND 2019, WITH SIX ALTERNATIVE MODELS. IN THIS REGARD, FEASIBLE GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION WAS EMPLOYED FOR THE PROPOSED MODEL SPECIFICATIONS. IT PROVIDES STRONG EVIDENCE THAT GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, EDUCATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION PERFORMANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, REAL GDP GROWTH, AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT RATE ALSO HAVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, BUT NEGATIVE, IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY FURTHER PROMOTE OR ARE A RESULT OF RESOURCE-BASED GROWTH RATHER THAN DIVERSIFICATION INTO OTHER TECHNOLOGY- AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SECTORS.
391	FOLLOWING THE BOSTON TEA PARTY AND PASSAGE OF THE PORT ACT, GENERAL THOMAS GAGE, THE NEW ROYAL GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, MOVED THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO SALEM. UPON HIS ARRIVAL, GAGE WAS GREETED BY DUELING ADDRESSES SIGNED BY 48 OF SALEM'S ROYALISTS AND 125 OF ITS WHIGS. THE ADDRESSES EXHIBIT CONTRASTING POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES; HOWEVER, THE SIGNERS' BACKGROUNDS REVEAL EACH GROUP EMBRACED VIEWS THAT SERVED ITS INTERESTS. ON THE ONE HAND, ROYALISTS SUPPORTED A POLITY THAT PROMOTED ORDER, STABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW, A SYSTEM THAT BENEFITED AN INTERRELATED GROUP OF OLD ELITE FAMILIES WITH LUCRATIVE KINSHIP TIES TO THE BAY COLONY'S POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT LED BY FORMER GOVERNOR THOMAS HUTCHINSON. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHIGS DEMANDED A GOVERNMENT THAT PROTECTED PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS SUITED ARTISANS, MASTER MARINERS, AND RISING MERCHANTS DETERMINED TO PRESERVE MEAGER OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED HOLDINGS FROM ENGLISHMEN, WHOM SALEMITES ASSERTED HAD "AN INTEREST IN LAYING BURTHENS UPON US FOR THEIR OWN RELIEF." THE PROPERTY THAT WHIG SIGNERS SOUGHT TO DEFEND SERVED VARIOUS PURPOSES. IT PROVIDED ECONOMIC SECURITY, AND IT WAS A SOURCE OF PERSONAL LIBERTY, MASCULINE PRIDE, AND A VOICE IN GOVERNMENT.
392	THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND CONTINUES, AND THE CONFLICT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ESCALATING. LEGAL CHAOS NOW REIGNS. ONE-SIXTH OF THE JUDGES IN ORDINARY COURTS HAVE NOW ASSUMED OFFICE WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY. THEY HAVE ISSUED MORE THAN TWO MILLION RULINGS. BUT AS THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) HAS CONFIRMED, THEIR APPOINTMENT CONTRADICTED EUROPEAN LAW. ACCORDING TO THE ECJ, POLISH COURTS ARE OBLIGATED TO EXAMINE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THESE JUDGES AND THEIR RULINGS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN BACKED INTO A CORNER AND IS REACTING BY INTENSIFYING THE CONFLICT. A GAG LAW PROHIBITS THIS EXAMINATION. JUDGES WHO ADHERE TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE BULLIED BY THE CHAIRMEN WHO HAVE ASSUMED OFFICE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT FORMED IN 2015, OR THEY ARE TREATED PATRONISINGLY BY THE EQUALLY CONTENTIOUS DISCIPLINARY CHAMBER. NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESORTED TO THE BIG GUNS. THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, WHICH IS SUBSERVIENT TO THE GOVERNMENT, HAS CERTIFIED THAT THE ECJ EXCEEDED ITS POWERS, AND THAT THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE POLISH CONSTITUTION. POLAND IS FACING FINES AND SUBSIDY CUTS, BUT GIVING IN IS NOT THIS GOVERNMENT'S STYLE..
393	SOME UNDERSTANDINGS OF EUROPEAN UNION HEALTH LAW ARE BASED ON A PRESUMPTION OF LAW AS A STATIC AND CLOSED SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH TO THE UNION AS A LEGAL ENTITY HAS IMPORTANT RAMIFICATIONS. THE UNION IS A POLITICAL SYSTEM CREATED BY AND SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. ITS SUCCESSES (AND FAILURES) ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LEGALISATION OF SOLVING EXTERNALITIES AND ENSURING MEMBER STATE SOLIDARITY TO GAIN BENEFITS FROM INTEGRATION. MEMBER STATES, WHICH CREATE AND SUSTAIN THE UNION BY REPEATED ACTS OF SOVEREIGN CHOICE, CHOOSE TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THE RULE OF (UNION) LAW. THIS PROTECTS BOTH THE MEMBER STATES AND THE UNION INSTITUTIONS (IMPERFECTLY, BUT NONETHELESS) FROM CHARGES OF ILLEGITIMACY. WHILE RECOGNISING THE BENEFITS OF SUCH AN APPROACH TO EUROPEAN UNION INTEGRATION AND LAW-MAKING, WE TAKE THE VIEW THAT LAW ALSO HAS AN IMPORTANT DYNAMIC POTENTIAL. THAT DYNAMIC POTENTIAL IS INHERENT IN ALL LAW, FOR LAW IS EMBODIED IN TEXT, AND ALWAYS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION, AS THE EXTERNAL CONTEXTS THAT GIVE LEGAL TEXT MEANING IN THE REAL-WORLD CHANGE THROUGH TIME. WE TRACE THE DYNAMIC POTENTIAL OF UNION HEALTH LAW BY LOOKING AT ITS LEGAL BASIS TO ITS FOUNDATIONAL TREATIES, AND WE PLOT ITS TRAJECTORY GOING FORWARD.
394	UN PEACE OPERATIONS HAVE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF "LOCAL OWNERSHIP." THE LOGIC IS SIMPLE. FOR PEACE OPERATIONS TO SUCCEED IN HELPING WAR-TORN STATES TO CREATE ACCOUNTABLE, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW, PEACE OPERATIONS NEED TO INTERNALIZE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES BY MAKING UN MISSIONS ACCOUNTABLE TO DIFFERENT DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES-CROSSING ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, SOCIAL, AND GENDER LINES-WITHIN THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY. AS PART OF A SPECIAL ISSUE ON "THE UNITED NATIONS AT SEVENTY-FIVE: LOOKING BACK TO LOOK FORWARD," THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT WHILE THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS AMONG UN MEMBER STATES AND UN BUREAUCRATS THAT LOCAL OWNERSHIP IS NECESSARY, UN PEACE OPERATIONS HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES TO CREATING TRUE LOCAL OWNERSHIP. THESE OBSTACLES INCLUDE THE UN'S FOCUS ON HOST-GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP; THE CHALLENGE OF CREATING TRUST WITH DIFFERENT DOMESTIC CONSTITUENCIES THAT REPRESENT DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES; THE SUPPLY-DRIVEN NATURE OF UN INTERVENTION; AND THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE UN'S IDEAL POST-CONFLICT STATE AND THE PREFERENCES OF POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. TO MAKE UN PEACE OPERATIONS MORE RESPONSIVE TO POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, UN STAFF OFTEN HAVE TO BEND OR BREAK RULES ESTABLISHED ONLY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR MEMBER STATES.
395	ARTICLE 18(4) OF THE BASIC LAW CREATES A DUAL EMERGENCY POWER: THE INTERNAL EMERGENCY POWER OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (HKSAR) AND THE EXTERNAL EMERGENCY POWER OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS. THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL EMERGENCIES REPRESENT TWO PARADIGMS OF EMERGENCY REGIME: THE FORMER IS BASED ON THE STATE OF EXCEPTION, IN WHICH A STATE MANAGES A CRISIS, LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF LEGAL RULES AND WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE LATTER IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE EMERGENCY POWER IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CONSTRAINTS. THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EMERGENCIES IN HONG KONG REPRESENT THE OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM OF EMERGENCY LAW BETWEEN THE LIBERAL HONG KONG AND THE STATIST, AUTHORITARIAN CHINESE STATE. HOWEVER, THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS PROVIDED IN THE BASIC LAW, SHOULD BE AND CAN BE OBSERVED IN BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EMERGENCIES. TO MAXIMISE THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WHILE ADDRESSING SECURITY CONCERNS, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE HKSAR TO INTERNALISE EMERGENCY MEASURES.
396	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD IN 2018, AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS BUILDING ON THE 2019 RELEASE OF THE V-DEM DATASET. FIRST, THE TREND OF AUTOCRATIZATION CONTINUES AND 24 COUNTRIES ARE NOW AFFECTED BY WHAT IS ESTABLISHED AS A "THIRD WAVE OF AUTOCRATIZATION". SECOND, DESPITE THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF GRADUAL AUTOCRATIZATION, DEMOCRATIC REGIMES PREVAIL IN A MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD (99 COUNTRIES, 55%) IN 2018. THUS, THE STATE OF THE WORLD IS UNMISTAKABLY MORE DEMOCRATIC COMPARED TO ANY POINT DURING THE LAST CENTURY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE NUMBER OF ELECTORAL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES HAD INCREASED TO 55, OR 31% OF ALL COUNTRIES. THIRD, THE AUTOCRATIZATION WAVE IS DISPROPORTIONALLY AFFECTING DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, BUT ALSO INDIA'S LARGE POPULATION. FOURTH, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE MEDIA, AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE AREAS UNDER ATTACK IN MOST COUNTRIES UNDERGOING AUTOCRATIZATION, BUT TOXIC POLARIZATION OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY SPREADING ACROSS REGIMES. FINALLY, WE PRESENT THE FIRST MODEL TO PREDICT AUTOCRATIZATION ("ADVERSE REGIME TRANSITIONS") POINTING TO THE TOP-10 MOST AT-RISK COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.
397	DURING THE YEARS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, ORDOLIBERALISM BECAME THE TARGET OF A EUROPEAN-WIDE CRITICAL CAMPAIGN. THIS SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IS WIDELY PERCEIVED AS THE IDEATIONAL SOURCE OF GERMANY'S CRISIS POLITICS, WHICH HAS EVEN LED TO AN ORDOLIBERALISATION OF EUROPE. THIS ESSAY QUESTIONS THE VALIDITY OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS. IT FOCUSES ON TWO ASPECTS THAT ARE WIDELY NEGLECTED IN CURRENT DEBATES. ONE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW IN THE ORDOLIBERAL VISION OF THE ORDERING OF ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. THE SECOND IS ITS CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND, IN PARTICULAR IN GERMAN PROTESTANTISM. THE INFLUENCE OF THE ORDOLIBERAL SCHOOL ON EUROPEAN LAW, SO THE ESSAY ARGUES, IS OVERRATED IN ALL STAGES OF THE INTEGRATION PROJECT. ANGLO-AMERICAN NEOLIBERALISM RATHER THAN GERMAN ORDOLIBERALISM HAS BEEN IN THE IDEATIONAL DRIVER'S SEAT SINCE THE 1980S. IN THE RESPONSES TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE ORDOLIBERAL COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW GAVE WAY TO DISCRETIONARY EMERGENCY MEASURES. WHILE THE FOUNDATIONAL SYNTHESIS OF ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CONCEPTS BECAME INDEFENSIBLE, THE CULTURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE ORDOLIBERAL TRADITION SURVIVED AND DEVELOPED A LIFE OF THEIR OWN, IN PARTICULAR IN GERMAN POLITICAL DISCOURSES.
398	RECENTLY THE TAX AND SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2016 MEASURES NO 2) BILL 2016 WAS INTRODUCED INTO PARLIAMENT PROPOSING TO INCORPORATE A STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER INTO COMMONWEALTH REVENUE LEGISLATION. UNDER THE PROPOSAL, A STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER WILL VEST IN THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION A QUASI-LEGISLATIVE POWER TO MODIFY REVENUE AND SUPERANNUATION LAWS TO REMEDY "UNFORESEEN OR UNINTENDED OUTCOMES" WHERE IT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE TAXPAYER. THE STATED GOAL OF ENACTING SUCH A MEASURE IS TO PROVIDE A TIMELIER RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES. AN EFFECTIVELY DRAFTED AND ADMINISTERED MEASURE COULD PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR TAXPAYERS; HOWEVER, THIS MEASURE PRESENTS CHALLENGES TO THE RULE OF LAW AND IT COULD BE ARGUED TAKES THE FORM OF A HENRY VIII CLAUSE. THIS ARTICLE WILL PROVIDE THE BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT TO THE PROPOSED STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER. IT WILL FURTHER CONSIDER WHETHER A STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER COULD BE CATEGORISED AS A HENRY VIII CLAUSE AND WHY SUCH CLAUSES ARE CONSIDERED UNDESIRABLE. THE ARTICLE WILL CONCLUDE BY POSTULATING IF THE BENEFITS ARISING FROM A PROPERLY ADMINISTERED STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER ARE SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THIS DELEGATION OF POWER TO THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION.
399	THROUGH TRAGIC EVENTS, SUCH AS THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 OR THE KIDNAPPING CASE OF JAKOB VON METZLER THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION AGAINST TORTURE IS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGED, EVEN IN STEADFAST RULE-OF-LAW STATES. THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT AND DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES RELATIVIZING THE ABSOLUTE BAN ON TORTURE. AS A HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION THIS ARTICLE STARTS WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF INTERROGATIONAL TORTURE. IN A SECOND PART THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE BAN ON TORTURE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PROHIBITION AS AN ABSOLUTE AND NON-DEROGABLE PROVISION. IN A NEXT STEP THE ARTICLE ANALYSES (THE IMPLEMENTATION OF) THE PROHIBITION ON TORTURE IN GERMAN AND US LAW. IN A LAST STEP THE DIFFERENT MODELS CHALLENGING THE ABSOLUTENESS OF THE PROHIBITION (THE EX ANTE AUTHORISATION AND THE EX POST JUSTIFICATION) ARE ANALYSED AND CRITICALLY DISCUSSED CONCLUDING THAT THE BAN ON TORTURE, CRUEL, INHUMAN AND DEGRADING TREATMENT SHOULD NOT BE RELATIVIZED ON AN EX ANTE LEVEL BUT ARGUING-IN EXTREME CASES-FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXCUSE AS REGARDS TO A CRIMINAL SANCTION FOR THE INTERROGATOR BREAKING THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION.
400	THE PROBLEM OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) IS PREVALENT IN AFRICA DUE TO CONFLICTS, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, MAN-MADE AS WELL AS NATURAL DISASTERS THAT ARE COMMONPLACE ON THE CONTINENT. THE KAMPALA CONVENTION, WHICH IS AN INNOVATIVE TOOL, SEEKS TO PROVIDE AFRICAN STATES WITH A ROADMAP TOWARDS LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND ERADICATE THE CAUSES OF DISPLACEMENT. AS SUCH, AFRICAN STATES, HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES, THE AFRICAN UNION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD GO BEYOND DURABLE SOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE REACTIVE, AND PAY MORE ATTENTION TO PROACTIVE STRATEGIES TO ERADICATE THE FACTORS THAT LEAD TO DISPLACEMENT. TO DO THIS, THERE IS NEED TO ADOPT A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF IDPS ON THE CONTINENT THROUGH A THREE-TIERED STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES; FIRSTLY, SHORT-TERM STRATEGY TO PROTECT THE IDPS BY PROVIDING SAFETY AND SECURITY, FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AS WELL AS BASIC LIVELIHOOD TO THE IDPS; SECONDLY, MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY TO RESTORE IDPS' DIGNITY AND ENSURE ADEQUATE LIVING CONDITIONS THROUGH RETURN, RESETTLEMENT, (RE)INTEGRATION, REPARATION, RESTITUTION AND REHABILITATION; AND THIRDLY, LONG-TERM STRATEGY TO ERADICATE ROOT CAUSES OF DISPLACEMENT AND FOSTERING AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.
401	THE PROHIBITION IN THE CONSTITUTION IN ARTICLE 355, WHICH PREVENTS THE BODIES AND BRANCHES OF GO-VERNMENT SUBSIDIES OR DONATIONS DECLARE FOR NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSONS OF PRIVATE LAW IS A HIGHLY SENSITIVE ISSUE IN COLOMBIA, BUT THAT PROHIBITION DOES NOT IS ABSOLUTE, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND NUANCES. WHILE SUBSIDIES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AND AUTHORIZED IN THE CONSTITUTION CONSIDERING THAT FOR ISSUE REQUIRES THE ENACTMENT OF A LAW WHICH ESTABLISHED BENEFICIARIES, TIMING, COST - BENEFIT AND PURPOSE THE INEQUALITIES OF THE POPULATION AND EXCLUSIONS HAVE UNDERGONE SOME POPULATION GROUPS AS OPPOSED TO AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND COMMITMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW, BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES A MATTER OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE AND THAT IS WHY ARE SOME REFLECTIONS ON DONATIONS AND GRANTS, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE NOT, OR CAN BE TAKEN AS SYNONYMS, WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES THAT MAY LEAD TO MISAPPLICATION RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVERS WHO ABUSE OR UNFAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND THE PARAMETERS ESTABLISHED THROUGH CASE-LAW TO ENSURE TRANSPARENT AND EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC RESOURCES.
402	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER BARRIERS TO PRACTICING LAW ARE APPROPRIATE. IT IDENTIFIES A CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE BARRIERS AND THE ROLE OF LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS (`LAWYERS') IN PERMITTING INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN THEIR BASIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. DEMOCRATIC VALUES REQUIRE MAKING LEGAL SERVICES AS EQUALLY AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE TO ALL CITIZENS, WHILE LIBERAL VALUES DICTATE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS ACCESS IN ORDER TO ENFORCE HUMAN RIGHTS, COMPETE IN A MARKET ECONOMY, AND ENGAGE IN A LEGAL SYSTEM GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW. LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES THEREFORE REQUIRE THE LOWEST BARRIERS TO BECOMING A LAWYER, CONSISTENT WITH THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF COMPETENCE AND THE RECOGNITION THAT THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCE REQUIRED WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE SEGMENT OF THE MARKET SERVED. ANY CONTRARY REGULATORY APPROACH REQUIRES STRONG EMPIRICAL SUPPORT TO OVERCOME THE PRESUMPTION OF LOW BARRIERS THAT LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES CREATE. ACCORDINGLY, THE ARTICLE REJECTS AS UNPERSUASIVE ARGUMENTS FOR HIGH BARRIERS BASED ON PROMOTING THE PUBLIC GOOD, AVOIDING RENT-SEEKING, PROTECTING CONSUMERS, ADVANCING JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY, REDRESSING LAWYER MISCONDUCT, AND PRESERVING LAWYERS' HIGH INCOMES.
403	THE DOMESTICATION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE NETHERLANDS: THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY AS A POLITICAL WEAPON FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY UNTIL 1945 DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT IS A CONTESTED COMBINATION OF MAJORITY RULE (AS OPPOSED TO ELITE RULE) AND THE RULE OF LAW (AS OPPOSED TO DICTATORSHIP). THIS CONTRIBUTION CHARTS THE HISTORICAL DEBATE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY IN THE NETHERLANDS. UNTIL THE 1880S THE WORD DEMOCRACY WAS SCARCELY USED IN THE DUTCH PARLIAMENT AND, IF USED, USUALLY IN THE DEROGATORY SENSE OF MOB RULE. PARLIAMENTARIANS COULD IGNORE IT BECAUSE NO LARGE DEMOCRATIC REFORM MOVEMENT EXISTED UNTIL THE NEO-CALVINIST ABRAHAM KUYPER AND SOCIALISTS BEGAN TO ADVOCATE DEMOCRACY AS THE RULE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE. THEY USED ARGUMENTS THAT TODAY WOULD COUNT AS POPULIST. IN 1917-1919 GENERAL SUFFRAGE WAS INTRODUCED. IN THE INTERWAR PERIOD LIBERALS AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS USED 'DEMOCRACY' TO DEFEND THE VALUES OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AGAINST NATIONAL SOCIALISM. AFTER THE WAR A NEW CONSENSUS EMERGED DEMOCRACY WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE ABSENCE OF DICTATORSHIP. DEMOCRACY WAS STRIPPED OF ITS POPULIST SIDE, IT WAS 'DOMESTICATED'. TODAY IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THIS DOMESTICATION REMAINS CONTESTED.
404	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE OBJECT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE ATTAINMENT OF EFFICIENT, TRANSPARENT AND FAIR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. IT DEFINES THE SCOPE AND SOME KEY PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND POSITS THAT IN NAMIBIA THE MAIN AIM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES AND OFFICIALS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE REQUIREMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 18 OF THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH EMBRACES AND EXTENDS THE COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES OF REVIEW. IN NAMIBIA, THE COURT HAVING ORIGINAL JURISDICTION IN JUDICIAL REVIEW IS THE HIGH COURT, UNLIKE MUCH OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE, EG FRANCE, WHICH HAS SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW COURTS. FINALLY, THE PAPER MENTIONS SOME CHALLENGES FACING ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN NAMIBIA AND OPINES THAT THE COMMON LAW AND ARTICLE 18 OF THE NAMIBIAN CONSTITUTION ARE, AT THIS STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JURISPRUDENCE IN NAMIBIA, ADEQUATE TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, SO LONG AS JUDGES, LAW ACADEMICS AND LEGAL PRACTITIONERS PLAY THEIR PART, AND MEMBERS OF THE BUREAUCRATIC AND POLITICAL EXECUTIVE RECEIVE ADEQUATE TRAINING IN THE WORKINGS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE.
405	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS ACHIEVED WHEN POLICIES ARE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED TO FOSTER THE WELL-BEING OF ALL. RESEARCH ON EQUALITY HAS GENERALLY FOCUSED ON WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AS THE FOUNDATION OF EMPOWERING A NATION. SIMILARLY, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED ATTENTION GIVEN TO WORKING WITH MEN IN GENDER EQUALITY. HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THESE TWO LINES OF THOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDER EQUALITY AND DEVELOPMENT BY EMPIRICALLY IDENTIFYING COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF GENDER EQUALITY OVER TIME FOR A SAMPLE OF 44 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. USING TREND ANALYSIS, WE FIND A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE INCLUSION IN ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION AND OPPORTUNITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AMONG THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC, INFRASTRUCTURAL, AND GOVERNANCE-RELATED FACTORS, INCOME, RURAL REVITALIZATION, MOBILE SUBSCRIPTION, FIXED TELEPHONE SUBSCRIPTION, AND RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN EXPLAINING THE LEVEL OF GENDER BALANCE. IN CONTRAST, WE FIND THAT UNEMPLOYMENT POSITIVELY IMPACTS GENDER EQUALITY. WE ASSOCIATE THIS OUTCOME WITH THE ROLE EXPANSION THEORY. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT DEBATE IN THE LITERATURE THAT WHEN ECONOMIES GROW, THEY STAND BETTER CHANCES OF FOSTERING GENDER EQUALITY.
406	THE SOLIDARITY, SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY (RSST) ARISES FROM THE THEORETICAL ADVANCES THAT SEEK FROM THE INDIVIDUAL FEELING TO GIVE MEANING TO THE CO-RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS THEIR HABITAT. THUS, THE NEED TO CARRY OUT THIS RESEARCH EMERGES, SEEKING TO ANALYZE SOLIDARITY AND SOCIAL TERRITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY AS AN EMERGING DEVELOPMENT MODEL FOR BOGOTA. WICH IS FRAMED IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH PROMOTES PUBLIC MANAGEMENT BY ACTIVATING THE TERRITORIAL SOCIETY AGAINST THE DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF SPACE IN MARKET ECONOMIES, TAKING AS REFERENCE POPULATION THE STREET VENDORS OF THE CITY OF BOGOTA, WHERE THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 50,038 REGISTERED IN THE RIVI ACCORDING TO A PUBLICATION MADE BY THE INSTITUTE FOR THE SOCIAL ECONOMY. THE PRAXEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGY EXPOSED BY BAUTISTA (2016) AND JULIAO VARGAS (2011) WAS USED FOR RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT, AND THE RESULTS ALLOW TO ESTABLISH EQUITY IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION AND THE BALANCE IN THE LAND USE AGAINST THE ENVIRONMENT; DEMONSTRATING THE GOVERNANCE INCIDENCE, SOLIDARITY, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE TERRITORY IN THE EMERGING DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL SPACE, THE IMPROVEMENT IN ITS COMPETITIVENESS, THE INCLUSION AND THE WELL-BEING OF ALL ITS INHABITANTS.
407	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE TRADITIONAL POPULIST ISSUE OF MONEY POLITICS WITHIN INDONESIAN GENERAL ELECTIONS, USING MERANTI ISLANDS REGENCY, RIAU PROVINCE, AS ITS CONCRETE CASE. SEVERAL PREVIOUS STUDIES INDICATE THAT MONEY POLITICS HAVE BEEN INTEGRAL IN THE GENERAL ELECTIONS AT BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THIS STUDY THUS DISCUSSES THE PRACTICE OF MONEY POLITICS IN THE CASE OF MERANTI ISLANDS REGENCY GENERAL ELECTIONS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FROM JULY TO AUGUST 2017 USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THE DATA COLLECTION WAS CARRIED OUT BY INTERVIEWING 22 INFORMANTS WHO WERE SELECTED PURPOSIVELY. THEY WERE MATCHED WITH OBSERVATIONS AND DOCUMENT DATA FOLLOWED BY QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THIS RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE REGION HAS COMPLICATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS: (1) A HIGH POVERTY RATE, (2) A LACK OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF MONEY POLITICS AND ITS EFFECTS, (3) A LACK OF A MONITORING SYSTEM, AND (4) A WEAK JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, FORMAL AND NON-FORMAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY ENHANCED AND EMPOWERED. THIS SHOULD BEGIN WITH ELECTION COMMITTEES, WHICH MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FROM THE STATE TO THE VILLAGE LEVELS. IT IS ALSO RECOMMENDED TO ESTABLISH ANTI-MONEY POLITICS VILLAGES AS A MEANS OF STIMULATING POLITICAL EDUCATION AND ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW.
408	THE INDIAN EVIDENCE ACT OF 1872 (IEA) CONTINUES TO BE IN FORCE IN MANY COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS EVEN THOUGH MANY OF ITS RULES REMAIN UNCHANGED SINCE ITS ENACTMENT 150 YEARS AGO, INCLUDING THE RULES ON LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE. HOWEVER, THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE IS VERY DIFFERENT AS COMPARED TO THESE RULES. WE MAKE THE CASE THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR CRITICAL AREAS IN WHICH THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE: WHETHER THE DOMINANT PURPOSE TEST CAN BE A UNIFYING CONSTRAINT ON TO WHOM AND WHAT LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE APPLIES TO; WHETHER THERE IS AN UNDIVORCEABLE LINK BETWEEN PRIVILEGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY; WHETHER PRIVILEGE CAN BE OUTWEIGHED OR OVERRIDDEN BY COMPETING INTERESTS; AND WHETHER THE IEA CAN ACCOMMODATE THE COMMON LAW DOCTRINE OF LITIGATION PRIVILEGE. IF THE RULES IN THE IEA AND THE COMMON LAW CANNOT BE RECONCILED, THEN TO THE EXTENT THAT LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RULES OF EVIDENCE AND IS EVEN FOUNDATIONAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, IEA JURISDICTIONS OUGHT TO CONSIDER HOW THE GAPS BETWEEN THE TWO REGIMES CAN BE BRIDGED TO AVOID FRAGMENTATION AND CONFUSION.
409	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE WHETHER THE LEGISLATION ENACTED IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT IN ROMANIA, BASED ON THE 2014 EU DIRECTIVES, IS EFFECTIVE IN FOSTERING RESILIENCE OF THE PUBIC INSTITUTIONS AND INDIRECTLY OF COMMUNITIES, AND TO PROVIDE A FIT-FOR-PURPOSE MECHANISM FOR DEALING WITH THE PANDEMIC GENERATED BY THE NEW TYPE OF CORONAVIRUS, SARS-COV-2. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE NECESSITY OF NEW RULES MEANT TO PROMOTE SWIFTLY PURCHASES DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. UNDOUBTEDLY, THE PANDEMIC GENERATED CRASS HAS RAISED SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO WHICH PUBLIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS IS IN PRINCIPLE PROPERLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH: URGENT NEED FOR SUPPLIES, WORKS AND SERVICES, BUT ALSO UNEMPLOYMENT OR PROTECTION OF OTHER DISADVANTAGED CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE. WE ARGUE THAT RESORTING TO SPECIFIC TOOTS (NEGOTIATED PROCEDURES, FRAMEWORK-AGREEMENTS, CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT, SUSTAINABLE AND SOCIAL PROCUREMENT, RESERVED CONTRACTS) WHEN CARRYING OUT SWIFT INTERVENTIONS GENERATED BY THE PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUITABLE DURING THIS HEALTH CRISIS OR EVEN FOR PREVENTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS PANDEMIC. INSTEAD, THE ATTENTION OF THE LEGISLATOR HAS BEEN CONCENTRATED ONLY ON (UNNECESSARILY) EXEMPTING THE SWIFT PURCHASES OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT FROM THE RULE OF LAW.
410	AT PRESENT, NATO IS FACING A SEVERE CRISIS AND HAS SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF DISINTEGRATION AND POLARIZATION OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN ITS MEMBER STATES. AT THE LAST HEAD MEETING OF THE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL, IN DECEMBER 2019, IN LONDON, FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON QUALIFIED NATO'S CURRENT CRISIS AS A "BRAIN DEATH."FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THE MAIN CAUSE OF THIS ALLEGED "BRAIN DEATH" IS THE ORGANIZATION'S SPECIAL STATUS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN FACT, NATO HAS CONSTANTLY VIOLATED ITS CONSTITUTIVE TREATY AND MANY OTHER INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONAL AND CUSTOMARY NORMS, INCLUDING IUS COGENS RULES. HOWEVER, THE ORGANIZATION HAS NEVER ASSUMED ANY NEGATIVE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS INTERNATIONALLY UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR. THIS SITUATION HAS REDUCED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INSTITUTION AND HAS CORRODED, FROM THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE, STATES' WILL TO COOPERATE WITH THE FULFILMENT OF ITS OBJECTIVES. THUS, NATO COULD ONLY SURMOUNT ITS CURRENT CRISIS AND CONTINUE TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE AS A GUARDIAN OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AND AS A PROMOTER OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, IF IT ACCEPTS TO SUBMIT ITS POLITICAL AND MILITARY POWER TO INTERNATIONAL LAW.
411	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES STATES? COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW THROUGH RATIFYING COUNCIL OF EUROPE TREATIES. WE PRESENT A FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF RATIFICATIONS OF ALL 221 COUNCIL OF EUROPE TREATIES THAT OPENED FOR RATIFICATION SINCE 1949 AMONG THE 47 CURRENT MEMBER STATES. APPLYING A MULTILEVEL COX REGRESSION, WE OBSERVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL SOURCES FOR STATES? COMMITMENT AND FIND EVIDENCE FOR BOTH COERCION AND EMULATION MECHANISMS. FIRST, UPCOMING EU MEMBERSHIP IS STRONGLY AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH TREATY RATIFICATION, CORROBORATING THE RELEVANCE OF ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY IN MAKING COUNTRIES TO COMMIT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. SECOND, STATES ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RATIFY IF A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY HAS RATIFIED AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH CONFIRMS A STRONG PATTERN OF REGIONAL DIFFUSION OF RIGHTS ACCEPTANCE IN EUROPE. HOWEVER, WE FIND THAT THIS PATTERN OF REGIONAL DIFFUSION IS STRONGER AMONG STATES WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DEMOCRACY, SUGGESTING THAT EMULATION PROCEEDS THROUGH MIMICRY. FINALLY, OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT COUNCIL OF EUROPE TREATY RATIFICATION IS ESPECIALLY STRONG DURING THE FIRST YEARS AFTER TREATY OPENING, SUGGESTING THAT RATIFICATION REFLECTS CONCERTED EFFORTS BY STATES INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION OF REGIONAL TREATIES.
412	MICHAEL OAKESHOTT'S DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'CIVIL ASSOCIATION' AND 'ENTERPRISE ASSOCIATION' HAS INSPIRED INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY THEORISTS TO CONCEIVE OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY AS NOT JUST A 'PURPOSIVE ASSOCIATION' CONSTRUCTED BY STATES TO SATISFY THEIR INTERESTS BUT ALSO AS A 'PRACTICAL ASSOCIATION' PROVIDING FORMAL AND PRAGMATIC RULES THAT ARE NOT INSTRUMENTAL TO PARTICULAR GOALS OF STATE POLICY. WHILE THIS ARTICLE IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE OAKESHOTTIAN TURN IN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY THEORY, IT SUGGESTS THAT SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM IT. THE ARTICLE SKETCHES OUT AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION OF INTERNATIONAL 'CIVIL ASSOCIATION', ONE THAT TRANSCENDS THE BOUNDARIES OF COMMUNITIES. IT IS ARGUED THAT SUCH A NOTION OF CIVIL ASSOCIATION IS BOTH POSSIBLE AND AT THE SAME TIME ANCHORED IN THE EXPERIENCES OF THE MODERN STATE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS NOTION OF INTERNATIONAL CIVIL ASSOCIATION, WHEN SUSTAINED BY AN ADEQUATE LEGAL CONCEPTION, PROMOTES THE ENFORCEMENT OF MORAL AND POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS BORDERS. FINALLY, IT IS ARGUED THAT EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS POST-BREXIT SHOULD STRIVE TO RETAIN, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, THE ELEMENT OF CIVIL ASSOCIATION PRESENT IN EUROPEAN RELATIONS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE CIVIL CONDITION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND IN ORDER TO ENHANCE POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS BORDERS.
413	THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY IMPLIES TWO BASIC ELEMENTS: THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS BY THE RULE OF LAW AND THE POSSIBILITY OF DETERMINING THE FUTURE THROUGH ELECTIONS OR OTHER FORMS OF PARTICIPATION. HOWEVER, IF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IMPLY A NON-SUSTAINABLE WAY OF LIFE, AND IF THE RIGHT TO MAKE FREE COLLECTIVE CHOICES INCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING FATAL MISTAKES, A TENSION SEEMS TO ARISE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND SUSTAINABILITY. THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WESTERN WAY OF LIFE AND THE WAY WE VIEW DEMOCRACY. THE QUESTION OF SUSTAINABILITY'S RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY OUGHT TO BE DISCUSSED MORE BROADLY. TRANSFORMATION SCIENCES WOULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE EXTENSIVE EXCHANGE WITH POLITICAL THEORY. THE CHALLENGE OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABILITY IN A DEMOCRATIC WAY IS MORE COMPLEX, AS CLASSICAL MODELS OF PARTICIPATORY OR DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY ARE INCREASINGLY SEEN TO BE IN A CRISIS STATE. A MORE INTENSE IMPACT OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS ON CITIZENS' WAYS OF LIFE WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED IF CITIZENS FEEL SUFFICIENTLY INVOLVED IN THE COLLECTIVELY BINDING DECISIONS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO IMPLEMENT. THE IDEA OF GREEN REPUBLICANISM THEREFORE SEEMS A PLAUSIBLE MODEL FOR A SUSTAINABLE DEMOCRACY.
414	'MODERN SLAVERY' IS INCREASINGLY BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO CIRCUMVENT THE RULE OF LAW BY VIRTUE OF THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH MANY EXPLOITERS OPERATE. THE THREAT POSED BY EXPLOITERS IS NOT, HOWEVER, RESTRICTED TO THE STATE; THE HORROR STORIES OFTEN SHARED BY VICTIMS AS TO THE GRAVE NATURE OF THE EXPLOITATION THEY TYPICALLY HAVE TO ENDURE SUGGEST THAT BOTH VICTIMS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY MUST BE PREPARED TO CONFRONT THE PHENOMENON OF MODERN SLAVERY IN A ROBUST AND CONCERTED FASHION. IN VIEW OF THE QUICKLY EVOLVING DYNAMICS OF MODERN SLAVERY AND THE CORRESPONDING THREATS POSED TO THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS, THE WESTMINSTER PARLIAMENT RECENTLY PASSED THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT, SOME TWO-AND-A-HALF MONTHS AFTER THE NORTHERN IRISH ASSEMBLY PASSED THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION ACT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE NUANCES OF THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINED IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE TO DATE, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL LEGISLATIVE COMMENTARY OF ITS MYRIAD PROVISIONS, IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, AS WELL AS THEIR LIKELY IMPACT IN PRACTICE.
415	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW A WIDE RANGE OF MEASURES OF TOLERANCE, CONSIDERED FROM SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE RELATE TO GROWTH IN THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON A GROWTH REGRESSION EQUATION WITH A SPECIFICATION THAT IS COMMON IN THE GROWTH LITERATURE. THE ESTIMATION INCLUDES THE GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES, FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS METHODS. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS BASED ON CROSS-COUNTRY DATA FROM A SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES FROM THE OECD. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS ON SOCIAL MEASURES OF TOLERANCE PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT THAT OECD COUNTRIES ARE TOLERANT TOWARD MIGRANTS AND WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND NATIONAL POLICY MAKING. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT POLITICAL RIGHTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RULE OF LAW AS INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL TOLERANCE, ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS PRESENTED HERE FROM OECD COUNTRIES LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TOLERANCE MATTERS FOR THE PROSPERITY OF NATIONS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY HAVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS BEYOND THE OECD COUNTRIES AND PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER MAKES A NEW EMPIRICAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE TOLERANCE LITERATURE.
416	THE WAVE OF GLOBALIZATION IN FINANCE DURING THE LAST DECADES LED TO THE RISE OF GLOBAL BANKS. ARE THESE MERELY COSTLY LIABILITIES TO THE COUNTRIES THAT SUPERVISE THEM, OR IS THEIR GLOBAL REACH ALSO BENEFICIAL FOR THE REAL ECONOMY AND FOR FDI IN PARTICULAR? RECENT LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON THE RISKS, EMPHASIZING TRANSMISSION OF SHOCKS FROM ONE COUNTRY TO MANY COUNTRIES. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THIS PAPER HYPOTHESIZES THAT GLOBAL BANKS HAVE MADE INVESTING ABROAD EASIER AND MORE SUCCESSFUL FOR THEIR HOME-MARKET CUSTOMERS. USING A NEW DETAILED DATA SET OF OUTWARD FDI, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT BANKS' DIRECT INVESTMENT ABROAD IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOLUME OF NON-FINANCIAL FDI FROM THE SAME HOME MARKET. THE RESULT IS ROBUST TO VARIOUS ROBUSTNESS EXERCISES WHICH SHOW THAT THE MAIN RESULTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE DRIVEN BY REVERSE CAUSALITY. THE EFFECT IS STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WHERE INVESTING IS MORE HAZARDOUS, THOSE WITH WORSE CORRUPTION AND WEAKER RULE OF LAW. CONVERSELY, THIS PAPER DOES NOT FIND EVIDENCE THAT HOST-MARKET DOMESTIC OR THIRD-COUNTRY FOREIGN BANKS FACILITATE FDI. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
417	MOST NEW DEMOCRACIES FACE A CHALLENGE OF RESHAPING THE POLITICAL CULTURE TO SUPPORT THE NEW DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ORDER. THIS CAN OFTEN BE A LONG-TERMPROCESS, COMPLICATED BY THE REALPOLITIK OF GOVERNING IN A NEW POLITICAL (AND OFTEN ECONOMIC) SYSTEM. ONE OF THE MECHANISMS OF CULTURAL CHANGE IS GENERATIONAL CHANGE. NEW GENERATIONS SOCIALIZED AFTER A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION ARE PRESUMABLY EDUCATED INTO THE POLITICAL NORMS OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC REGIME. HOWEVER, ONE CAN ALSO IMAGINE THAT THE YOUNG LACK CLEAR POLITICAL CUES BECAUSE THEY GROW UP UNDER A SYSTEMIN TRANSITION, OR EVEN REJECT THE NEW ORDER IF IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY WIDESPREAD SOCIAL DISLOCATION. THE STUDY OF GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN NEW DEMOCRACIES THUS PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PROCESSES TRANSFORMING A NATION'S POLITICAL CULTURE. WE ANALYZE GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF EAST ASIA USING THE SECOND WAVE OF THE EAST ASIAN BAROMETER. WE EXAMINE SUPPORT FOR A DEMOCRATIC/AUTHORITARIAN REGIME AND THE CITIZENSHIP NORMS THAT UNDERLIE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS (SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL TOLERANCE). OUR RESULTS YIELD EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN REGIME NORMS IN THESE NEW DEMOCRACIES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE POLITICAL CULTURE IS GRADUALLY BEING TRANSFORMED.
418	ONE CAN DRAW A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE RESTRICTIONS STATES PLACE ON THEIR SOLDIERS' USE OF FORCE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE UNITED NATIONS RESTRICTS A STATE'S USE OF FORCE UNDER ARTICLE 2(4) OF THE CHARTER. THIS PARALLEL IS USEFUL IN SHOWING HOW BOTH THE 'SOVEREIGNS' LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FORCE ARE, IN TURN, LIMITED BY RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE THAT GO BEYOND SELF-DEFENCE AND INTO THE REALM OF THE DEFENCE OF DURESS, NECESSITY AND COERCION, GIVING RISE TO A JUSTIFICATION OR AN EXCUSE. THE UNITED NATIONS' ABSOLUTE RESTRICTION ON THE USE OF FORCE, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE LIMITED BY MORE THAN JUST THE SELF-DEFENCE PROVISION OF ARTICLE 51 AND WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW UNILATERAL HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES. THE US MILITARY COURTS, IN DICTA, HAVE IMPLIED A BALANCING TEST IN WHICH THE ORDER TO NOT USE FORCE CAN BE TRUMPED BY THE IMMINENCE AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT TO THE INNOCENT; THEREFORE, CONTINUED OBEDIENCE WOULD NO LONGER BE MANDATED. THIS CONCLUSION, AS HIGHLIGHTED BY GEORGE FLETCHER AND JENS OHLIN IN THEIR BOOK, DEFENDING HUMANITY, IS ROOTED IN THE EVOLUTION OF BOTH LAW AND PHILOSOPHY.
419	THE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED INCREASING ATTENTION IN COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING PALESTINE. THIS IS DUE TO ITS SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN INCREASING EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, ACHIEVING TRANSPARENCY, ADDRESSING ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS, COMBATING FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CORRUPTION, ACHIEVING DEVELOPMENT, AND INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN ENTITIES THAT APPLY THE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF GOVERNANCE. USING THE INDUCTIVE AND ANALYTICAL APPROACHES, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE LEGAL ROOTING OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND ITS PRINCIPLES AND TO STUDY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRINCIPLES ARE APPLIED IN THE STATE OF PALESTINE. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE REQUIRES THE REALIZATION OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND FLEXIBLE SEPARATION OF POWERS, IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTENCE OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT APPLIES TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, JUSTICE, CONSENSUS, PARTICIPATION, EFFICIENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, AND STRATEGIC VISION, WHETHER THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GOVERNMENTAL OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND IT ALSO REQUIRES AN ACTIVE ROLE FOR CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS. AND THAT THE RIGHTLY GUIDED RULE IN ISLAM CONTAINED A SET OF PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS THAT NO OTHER SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT HAD EVER LIVED UP TO. AND THAT THE PALESTINIAN POLITICAL DIVISION NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN PALESTINE.
420	WITH THE PUBLICATION OF THE PANAMA PAPERS IN 2016, LAW FIRMS AND ATTORNEYS CAME UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT ATTORNEYS, PROTECTED BY THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CONCEALING THE ORIGIN OF ILLICIT FUNDS AND THE CONSTRUCTING OF OFFSHORE COMPANY-SCHEMES. THE PUBLIC OUTCRY PROMPTED LEGISLATORS TO HOLD THESE FACILITATORS ACCOUNTABLE AND TO PREVENT MONEY-LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES BY IMPOSING REPORTING OBLIGATION ON THEM, WHENEVER THERE IS THE SUSPICION OF A CLIENT BEING INVOLVED IN ILLICIT ACTIVITIES. UNSURPRISINGLY, ATTORNEY AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS VOICED CONSIDERABLE OPPOSITION TO THESE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS CLAIMING AN EROSION OF THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND NOTHING LESS THAN AN ATTACK ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE FROM A HISTORICAL, EMPIRICAL, AND CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS IN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND EXEMPLIFIES HOW REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AFFECT LEGAL PRACTICE AND WHAT CHALLENGES EXIST FOR ATTORNEYS. BOTH COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED GLOBAL HUBS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES. THE LEGAL CONCEPTS OF HOLDING ATTORNEYS ACCOUNTABLE IN THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES DIFFER IN SOME RESPECTS. IN CONCLUSION, IT SHOWS THAT THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS SUCCESSFULLY MANAGED TO WIDELY AVOID A 'RESPONSIBILIZATION'.
421	FIRST PEOPLES CONTINUE TO FACE INTERGENERATIONAL HARMS AS A RESULT OF SETTLER SYSTEMS OF INTERVENTION IN THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES, INCLUDING THE FORCED REMOVAL OF CHILDREN. FIRST PEOPLES RESISTANCE INCLUDES ADVOCACY FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE, IN PARTICULAR, FOCUSED ON FOUNDATIONS OF GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IN CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS, AND RECOGNITION OF FIRST PEOPLES' RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. HOWEVER, ACHIEVING THESE NECESSARY STRUCTURAL CHANGES REMAINS A PRESSING CHALLENGE.USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE RECENT ABORIGINAL-LED REVIEW OF CHILD WELFARE IN NEW SOUTH WALES (NSW), AUSTRALIA, 'FAMILY IS CULTURE', THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CYCLE OF INQUIRY AND RESPONSE, AND THE REPEATED FAILURES TO ENABLE SELF-DETERMINATION OR STRENGTHEN PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. DRAWING ON CONCEPTS INCLUDING LEGITIMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, WE CONCEPTUALISE THIS PATTERN OF REVIEWS AS A RITUAL OF REDEMPTION BY SETTLER CHILD - WELFARE SYSTEMS, DISTANCING THEMSELVES FROM 'PAST' WRONGS WHILE REFUSING TO ADDRESS THE HARMFUL FOUNDATIONS OF THESE SYSTEMS, THEREBY PERPETUATING THE VIOLENCE IMPOSED ON FIRST PEOPLES CHILDREN, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THIS CONTRASTS WITH FIRST PEOPLES' FRAMEWORKS FOR CHILD WELFARE REFORM, WHICH MUST BE URGENTLY REALISED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH SUCH SYSTEMS ON MORE JUST AND EFFECTIVE FOUNDATIONS.
422	WE ARGUE THAT POPE FRANCIS' POST-SYNOD EXHORTATION AMORIS LAETITIA ASSUMES AS ITS STRUCTURING CORE THE GAP BETWEEN DOCTRINE AND PASTORAL, JUSTIFICATION AND APPLICATION, FROM THE RECOGNITION THAT HUMAN PLURALITY AND ITS PRACTICAL-HISTORICAL CONTINGENCIES CONSOLIDATE INEXORABLE THE MARK OF COMPLEXITY AS ORIENTING BASIS OF INSTITUTIONAL COMPREHENSION AND ACTION. AS CONSEQUENCE, WE HAVE A MOAT OF THEORY AND PRACTICE WHICH CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY THE PRIMACY OF LOVE IN RELATION TO TRUTH AND, THEREFORE, BY THE RELATIVE AUTONOMY OF PASTORAL REGARDING TO DOCTRINE, SO DIRECT AND NON-MEDIATED APPLICATION OF THE CREED GIVES ITS PLACE TO THE NECESSARY MEDIATIONS PROPER TO EACH CONCRETE SITUATION AND SUBJECT. WE WILL ARGUE, FROM THIS, THAT IT IS GENERATED A DEMOCRATIC PEDAGOGY OF RELIGION CHARACTERIZED BY AFFIRMATION, RECOGNITION AND VALORIZATION OF DIVERSITY THAT LEADS TO INSTITUTIONAL MODERATION, TO MINIMIZATION OF FUNDAMENTALISM AND TO SENSIBILITY WITH THE DIFFERENCES AS IRREDUCIBLE BEINGS. NOW, FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PEDAGOGY OF RELIGION WE COME TO A RELIGION PEDAGOGY OF DEMOCRACY IN WHICH RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION ASSUMES AN ANTIFASCIST, ANTI-TOTALITARIAN AND NON-FUNDAMENTALIST PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS AS BASIC PURPOSE THE RADICAL DEFENSE OF DIVERSITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
423	DESPITE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MALNUTRITION AND HUNGER IN RECENT YEARS, FOOD AND NUTRITION INSECURITY REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) COUNTRIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EMPLOY A PANEL DATA COVERING 15 SSA COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2015 TO INVESTIGATE THE GROWTH EFFECTS OF REMITTANCES AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE ON FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY, PROXIED BY THE AVERAGE VALUE OF FOOD PRODUCTION AND THE AVERAGE DIETARY ENERGY SUPPLY ADEQUACY, RESPECTIVELY. WE USE A DYNAMIC EMPIRICAL MODEL BASED ON SYSTEM GMM TO CONTROL FOR UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY AND POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY OF THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS EMANATING FROM OUR ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE INTERACTION OF REMITTANCES AND THE COMPOSITE INDEX OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY EXERTS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE AVERAGE VALUE OF FOOD PRODUCTION, AND ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF AVERAGE DIETARY ENERGY SUPPLY ADEQUACY IN SSA. IN ADDITION, THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW SCORES INCREASE BOTH MEASURES OF FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY. ALBEIT, THE CONTRIBUTION OF CONTROL OVER CORRUPTION SCORE IS RELATIVELY THE LARGEST AS COMPARED TO OTHER INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE. (C) 2019 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.
424	THE 2016 POST-COUP ATTEMPT MEASURES IN TURKEY HAVE BEEN EVALUATED AS A PROCESS OF BACKSLIDING ON CIVIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THIS CONTRIBUTION TAKES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH. THE SO-CALLED 'DEMOCRATIC BREAKDOWN' OR 'BACKSLIDING' IN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS A (MERE) ATTRIBUTE OF THE POST-COUP AFTERMATH. THE IDEA THAT A PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN TURKEY DERAILED OR BECAME DISRUPTED AFTER THE COUP ONLY FEEDS THE MYTH THAT THERE HAD BEEN SUCH A PROCESS OF PRE-COUP DEMOCRATIZATION. IN THIS ARTICLE, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE REFORMS OFTEN HELD UP AS A 'DEMOCRATIZATION' WERE RATHER INSTRUMENTS OPPORTUNISTICALLY EMPLOYED IN THE ADALET VE KALKINMA PARTISI (JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY, AKP) STRUGGLE TO CONQUER THE STATE, TO TAKE IT FROM A KEMALIST ELITE AND TO ROLL BACK AND CONTAIN A KURDISH MOVEMENT THAT MADE PLEAS FOR A PLURALISTIC CITIZENSHIP AND THE STRENGTHENING OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THESE HAVE NOW MORPHED INTO AN OVERT AUTHORITARIANISM, IN WHICH A REGIME OF EXCEPTIONS, NOT UNKNOWN TO THE KURDS AND THE KURDISTAN REGION IN TURKEY, HAS BECOME THE NORM, THE PARTICULAR GENERALIZED. THIS IS WHAT IS REFERRED TO HERE AS AN 'ORGANIZATIONAL COUP'.
425	RESEARCH IN THE LAW FACULTIES OF THE LICENSED UNIVERSITIES CONTINUES WITH THE USE OF THE LEGAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY WHICH IS NOT ANOTHER WAY OF ACCEPTING AND DEVELOPING THE METHODOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, THEREBY REDUCING IT TO THE STUDY OF THE FIELD OF LAW ONLY BY DOGMATIC LEGAL FIELD. THEREFORE, CARRYING OUT RESEARCH WITH ONE OR ANOTHER METHOD LIMITS THE POSSIBILITY OF REACHING KNOWLEDGE THAT ALLOWS US TO SPECIFY WHAT THE LAW IS AND HOW IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A SOCIETY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN WHICH ARE THE NORMS THAT SEEK TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE SITUATIONS PROBLEMATIC IF IT IS CONTINUED UNDER A UNIQUE MODEL OF RESEARCH METHODOLOGY. IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ADVANCE IN THE FIELD OF LAW, SO IT IS NECESSARY THAT UNIVERSITIES ALLOW RESEARCH TO BE CARRIED OUT BASED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES BOTH PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL, AMONG OTHERS. POSSIBILITIES AS CAN BE FOUND IN THE VARIOUS BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PRODUCTIONS ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF LAW; THEREFORE, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN OPEN METHODOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION IS PROPOSED IN THE FACE OF THE LIMITATIONS ESTABLISHED IN THE CURRICULA IN THE LAW SCHOOLS OF THE LICENSED UNIVERSITIES.
426	RATHER THAN ASK WHY NEW ZEALAND SUPPORTED THE INTERVENTION, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON HOW REPRESENTATIONS OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST THREAT RESULTED IN PUBLIC ACQUIESCENCE TO A PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE BY THE WORLD'S SOLE SUPERPOWER AGAINST ONE OF THE POOREST, MOST WAR-TORN COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT LEGITIMACY WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE BLENDING OF THEMES OF TERRORISM AND WAR, NATIONAL INTEREST AND DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, TO PRODUCE AN AMBIGUOUS 'INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST TERRORISM' THAT ALLOWED FOR PICKING AND CHOOSING OF THE MOST CONVENIENT POSITION ON DIFFERENT MATTERS. THE ALTERNATIVE-TO REFUSE MORAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES-LED 'WAR ON TERROR'-WAS TO RISK NEW ZEALAND'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE UNITED STATES-LED INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND A 'SEAT AT THE TABLE' IN FUTURE INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND SECURITY NEGOTIATIONS. AS SUCH, ANY CAMPAIGN BENEFITS APPEAR TO HAVE ACCRUED TO NEW ZEALAND RATHER THAN AFGHANISTAN OR THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE PARLOUS STATE OF THAT COUNTRY IN 2018. A WIDE-RANGING DEBATE WITHIN NEW ZEALAND ON THE PURPOSE OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS IS NEEDED BEFORE SIMILAR COMMITMENTS ARE MADE IN THE FUTURE.
427	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE EFFECT OF THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE ON DIFFERENT MEASURES OF THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, USING DATA ON 164 COUNTRIES, OVER THE PERIOD FROM 2006 TO 2010. THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT AVERAGE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, AS A MEASURE OF HUMAN CAPITAL, POSITIVELY AFFECTS FOUR OF THE SIX MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WE CONSIDER, NAMELY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW. THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF INTELLIGENCE IS ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR OTHER DETERMINANTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. IT FOLLOWS THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF HUMAN CAPITAL ENJOY INSTITUTIONS OF BETTER QUALITY THAN COUNTRIES WITH LOW LEVELS. THIS FINDING SHOULD BY NO MEANS BE INTERPRETED AS EVIDENCE THAT THERE EXIST SOME COUNTRIES WITH MORE INTELLIGENT POPULATIONS THAT BUILD BETTER INSTITUTIONS AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES WITH LESS INTELLIGENT POPULATIONS THAT BUILD POOR INSTITUTIONS. WHAT OUR FINDING POINTS OUT TO IS THE FACT THAT A COTINTRY'S LEVEL OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEGREE OF COOPERATION OF ITS HUMAN CAPITAL WITHIN NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IS IMPORTANT FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.

428	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN THE ECONOMIES OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA, AND SOUTH AFRICA (BRICS) AND THE COMPARATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FACTORS IN ATTRACTING FDI. THIS STUDY USES PANEL DATA FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS (2000-2010) IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF FDI IN BRICS FROM A HOLISTIC APPROACH. ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE USING THE PANEL UNIT-ROOT TEST AND MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS. THIS STUDY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT MACROECONOMIC STABILITY (INFLATION RATE), POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW AS POTENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF FDI. THESE FACTORS ARE BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE FROM PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL LITERATURE. THE OVERALL RESULTS SHOW THAT TWO FACTORS, NAMELY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY, ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO FDI INFLOW IN BRICS. THREE VARIABLES IN THE MODEL, NAMELY POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FDI INFLOW IN BRICS ECONOMIES, WHICH IMPLIES THAT THESE THREE FACTORS ARE NOT IMPORTANT FOR ATTRACTING MORE FDI INFLOW.
429	THE UNITED KINGDOM'S LEVESON INQUIRY HAS BEEN THE HOTTEST FREE SHOW IN TOWN SINCE IT BEGAN TAKING EVIDENCE IN NOVEMBER 2011 UNTIL THE FIRST PHASE OF THE INQUIRY CONCLUDED ON 24 JULY 2012. DURING THAT TIME, THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO A TSUNAMI OF INFORMATION FROM THE GREAT AND THE GOOD IN BRITAIN, WHICH RAISED QUESTIONS NOT ONLY ABOUT JOURNALISM PRACTICES AND ETHICS BUT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE IMPORTANCE TO ANY DEMOCRACY OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY CANNOT BE OVERESTIMATED. SIR BRIAN LEVESON BEGAN THE INQUIRY BY POSING THE QUESTION: WHO GUARDS THE GUARDIANS? HE STRESSED THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WAS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF ANY DEMOCRACY AND THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO STIFLE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN BRITAIN. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDERS THE FUTURE FOR PRESS REGULATION IN BRITAIN. IT ALSO MAKES THE POINT THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF WHATEVER NEW REGIME IS ESTABLISHED, IT IS TIME FOR PROPRIETORS, EDITORS AND JOURNALISTS TO STAND UP FOR RESPONSIBLE, PUBLIC INTEREST JOURNALISM AND ONLY THEN WILL THERE BE AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN MAINSTREAM JOURNALISM WILL BE RESTORED.
430	THIS PAPER EXPLORES SOME OF THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) AND THE FRAMEWORKS DEVISED TO IMPLEMENT THEM. IT LOOKS AT VARIOUS DOCTRINAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES PERTAINING TO EITHER THE CONTINENT'S PROGRESS TOWARDS AN EFFECTIVE AND STRONG CONTINENTAL INTEGRATION OR A REPEAT OF THE FAILINGS OF ITS PREDECESSOR ORGANISATION, THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY. THE INTERLINKED PRINCIPLES RELATING TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN THE MAIN ISSUES OF INQUIRY RATHER THAN ECONOMIC (AND MONETARY), COLLECTIVE SECURITY OR THE AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS. THE INQUIRY WILL OFFER AN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND THEORETICAL INSIGHT ONTO THE NORMATIVE AND PRACTICAL DIMENSIONS OF THE INTEGRATION DEBATE IN AFRICA. BY HIGHLIGHTING THE TENSION BETWEEN LIBERAL AND CONSTRUCTIVIST THEORIES OF INSTITUTIONS AND VARIOUS INTEGRATION STRATEGIES AS APPLIED TO AFRICA, THE PAPER PURPORTS TO IDENTIFY AND TO CRITIQUE THE ACHIEVEMENTS MADE SO FAR AND THE SERIOUS CHALLENGES AHEAD OF THE AU. IT IS ARGUED THAT WHILST THE PROGRESS MADE THUS FAR IS SIGNIFICANT, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO TALK OF THE HUGE SUCCESS OR COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE DECADE-OLD AU.
431	IN POST-WAR SOCIETIES EXTERNAL ACTORS PROMOTE DEMOCRACY WITHIN A BROAD FRAMEWORK OF STATE- AND NATION-BUILDING, RULE-OF-LAW BUILDING, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BUT NOT ALL DEMOCRACY PROMOTION EFFORTS SUCCEED IN AN EQUAL WAY. A CLOSER LOOK AT CASES OF INTERVENTION AND DEMOCRATIZATION SINCE 1945 HELPS US TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS VARIATION. CASES OF DEMOCRATIZATION CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL OF POST-WAR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL TRUST VERSUS THE LEVEL OF INNER-SOCIETAL VIOLENCE, THE CHARACTER OF REMAINING STATENESS, THE POTENTIAL EROSION OF THE NATION, AND THE TERMS OF PEACE. IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE DEMOCRATIZATION SUCCESSES OF THE POST-WORLD WAR II PERIOD ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE APPARENT DEMOCRATIZATION FAILURES OF THE 1990S AND AFTER 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ON THE OTHER, THE STRATEGIES EXTERNAL ACTORS USE IN POST-WAR TRANSFORMATION MUST BE CONSIDERED. SOMETIMES, EXTERNAL ACTORS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THEIR ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO DEAL WITH THE FIVE ISSUES MENTIONED ABOVE. GIVEN DIFFERENCES IN BOTH STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS AND ACTOR ENGAGEMENT, EXTERNAL ACTORS SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WHEN USING SOME OF THE EARLY DEMOCRATIZATION CASES AS BLUEPRINTS FOR DEMOCRACY PROMOTION TODAY.
432	IN THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW REMAINS CRUCIAL, IN SEVERAL RESPECTS. THE EU CONSTITUTION, IN ITS BROADEST SENSE, BUILDS ON THE COMMON CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE MEMBER STATES, AND EU LAW REFERS BACK TO NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN MANY WAYS. NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONTRIBUTES TO CONSTITUTIONALISING THE EU, TO GIVE IT LEGITIMACY, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE EU AND THE MEMBER STATES AS ITS AGENTS CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. ALSO, FROM THE NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW REMAINS ESSENTIAL, SINCE IT PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION OF MEMBERSHIP OF THE EU, IT IS DECISIVE FOR THE PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED WHEN POWERS ARE TRANSFERRED AT TIMES OF ACCESSION AND TREATY AMENDMENT, AND IT SERVES TO PROVIDE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND THE EU LEGAL ORDERS. PARTICIPATION IN THE EU REQUIRES ADAPTATION OF THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, AND NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED IN THE PROCESS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF EUROPE. THIS PAPER LOOKS INTO THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE EU-15 WITH THE EU AND ASKS WHETHER LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED FOR CANDIDATE COUNTRIES.
433	THE UNITED STATES HAS IN RECENT YEARS COME UNDER CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM FOR ITS APPARENTLY CYNICAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL LAW. WHILE THE US ADMINISTRATION REFERS OFTEN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IT APPEARS UNWILLING TO ITSELF BE BOUND BY THAT LAW. WHILE THE US TOOK THE LEAD IN THE POST WORLD WAR II YEARS IN ESTABLISHING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONS IT HAS IN RECENT YEARS APPEARED UNWILLING TO GIVE THOSE SAME INSTITUTIONS ITS FULL SUPPORT. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY EXAMINING A RANGE OF EXPLANATIONS FOR THE SEEMINGLY UNDESIRABLE US ATTITUDE TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL LAW. DISMISSING EACH AS INADEQUATE ON ITS OWN, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW WHAT OFTEN APPEAR TO BE CONTRADICTORY ASPECTS OF THE UNITED STATES' RELATIONSHIP WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN IN FACT BE RECONCILED THROUGH THE APPLICATION TO UNITED STATES' BEHAVIOUR OF THE BASIC TENETS OF CLASSIC MODERN REALISM AS IT PERTAINS TO THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN POLICY. THIS IS SURPRISING SINCE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND REALPOLITIK ARE MORE OFTEN CONTRASTED. THE UNITED STATES' 'ATTITUDE' TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL LAW IS BETTER EXPLAINED NOT AS A POST-COLD WAR ANOMALY BUT AS HAVING BEEN AN INTEGRAL ASPECT OF THE RISE OF THE UNITED STATES TO SOLE SUPERPOWER STATUS.
434	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF MORAL HAZARD ON ISSUES CONCERNING A NEGLIGENCE RULE VERSUS STRICT LIABILITY. THE STUDY FINDS THAT WHEN THE OWNER OF A FIRM HIRES AN EMPLOYEE TO PRESIDE OVER POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ACTIVITIES, DIFFERENT LIABILITY RULES MOTIVATE THE OWNER TO INDUCE THE EMPLOYEE TO EXERT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT WHETHER GREATER CARE IN THE PREVENTION OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS IS INDUCED BY A STRICT OR NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY RULE DEPENDS UPON THE UTILITY FUNCTION OF THE AGENT AND THE DEGREE OF MORAL HAZARD PRESENT IN THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. TO IMPLEMENT THE ANALYSIS, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS A NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY SYSTEM TO BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN EFFORT IS NOT OBSERVABLE. FINALLY, UNDER A NEGLIGENCE RULE, BOTH THE LEVEL OF THE OPTIMAL DUE CARE STANDARD AND THE AGENT'S LEVEL OF ACCIDENT PREVENTION EFFORT WILL GENERALLY DEPEND ON WHETHER MORAL HAZARD IS PRESENT WITHIN THE FIRM. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT COURTS SHOULD CONSIDER THE LEVEL OF MORAL HAZARD WITHIN THE FIRM PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW THAT WILL BE EMPLOYED WHEN ASSESSING LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT.
435	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY (IEQ) IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL CULTURE (NC) AND TAX EVASION (TE). PRIOR RESEARCH EXAMINED THE DIRECT IMPACT OF CULTURE ON TAX EVASION BUT DID NOT EXAMINE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THIS RELATIONSHIP. USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING AND EXAMINING DATA FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COUNTRIES OVER THE 2004-2018 PERIOD, WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES THAT EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF POWER DISTANCE, UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE, COLLECTIVISM, AND RESTRAINT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF TAX EVASION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT IEQ HAS A MEDIATING EFFECT ON THE NC-TE NEXUS, SUGGESTING THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD AIM AT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO DIMINISH THE UNDESIRABLE INFLUENCE OF CULTURE ON TAX EVASION LEVELS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE FIND THAT THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE THE IEQ INDICATORS THAT FULLY MEDIATE THE NC-TE RELATIONSHIP. MOREOVER, SPLITTING THE SAMPLE INTO OLDER AND NEWER EU COUNTRIES SHOWS A PARTIAL MEDIATION EFFECT IN OLDER EU COUNTRIES AND A FULL MEDIATION EFFECT IN NEWER EU COUNTRIES. ENHANCING IEQ CAN PLAY A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN NEWER EU COUNTRIES TO REDUCE THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF CULTURAL VALUES ON TAX EVASION.
436	HOMICIDE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MORTALITY CAUSES THAT HAS REDUCED THE MEXICAN LIFE EXPECTANCY. THAT IS WHY THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO IDENTIFY SOME SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT CAN HELP EXPLAIN HOMICIDES IN MEXICO AND MEASURE THEIR IMPACT, ASSUMING THE CURRENT CONDITIONS PREVAIL. TO DO THAT, SEVERAL MACHINE LEARNING (ML) METHODS WERE EVALUATED. THE C5.0 MODEL IS BEST SUITED FOR THE DATA AT HAND. AFTER FINE-TUNING THE ALGORITHM, WE USED THE ESTIMATED MODEL TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN HOMICIDES. AMONG THESE FACTORS, ELEVEN WERE SELECTED THAT CAN BE INFLUENCED BY DIRECT CHANGES IN DOMESTIC PUBLIC POLICY, LAWS AND/OR REGULATIONS. THESE WERE USED AS INPUT IN A TWO-LEVEL FRACTIONAL FACTORIAL STATISTICAL DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE) TO ESTIMATE THEIR MAIN EFFECTS AND POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THESE FACTORS HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON HOMICIDE RATE, THE ONE THAT HAD THE BIGGEST AND DIRECT IMPACT FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, WAS THE RULE OF LAW INDEX (RLI). IN FACT, IF WE ASSUMED THAT ALL STATES HAD THE MEDIAN RLI OF 0.37, IMPLEMENTING DOMESTIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MOVE THEM ALL TO THE BEST RLI LEVEL COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE HOMICIDE RATES.
437	THE PURPOSE OF THESE PAGES IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE DECISIONAL DISAGREEMENTS ARE NOT SUCH, BUT RATHER PROFOUND DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW (DEMOCRATIC AND CONSTITUTIONAL), SUCH AS THE SUBMISSION TO THE LAW OF JUDICIAL ADJUDICATION, REGARDLESS OF THE JUSTICE OF THE RULE OR OF ITS APPLICATION TO THE SPECIFIC CASE. FIRST, I WILL ANALYZE THE CONCEPT OF DISAGREEMENTS IN LAW, DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THEORETICAL, INTERPRETATIVE, DECISIONAL AND AXIOLOGICAL DISAGREEMENTS. SECONDLY, I WILL FOCUS ON DECISIONAL DISAGREEMENTS TO SHOW THAT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT SUCH. THESE ARE THOSE BASED ON DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS SUCH AS: A) THE EXISTENCE OF A SPURIOUS INTERPRETATIVE DISAGREEMENT, B) THE ARGUMENT BASED ON PRINCIPLES AND C) THE ARGUMENT OF THE DEFESEABILITY OF NORMS. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THE JUDGE'S DISAGREEMENT ON THE JUSTICE OF THE RULE OR ITS APPLICATION TO THE SPECIFIC CASE, WHICH EXCEEDS THE TASK ENTRUSTED TO JUDGES AND QUESTIONS ONE OF THE PILLARS OF CONSTITUTIONAL STATES: THE SUBMISSION OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS TO THE SOURCES OF LAW.
438	\THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO REVEAL THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF PROSECUTION FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS A SET OF GENERAL SCIENTIFIC METHODS (DIALECTICS, ABSTRACTION, GENERALIZATION, ANALYSIS, MODELLING) AND SPECIAL METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC COGNITION (COMPARATIVE AND LEGAL METHOD, ETC.). THE EXISTING TYPES OF RESPONSIBILITY AND PENALTIES FOR COMMITTING CONTEMPT OF COURT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED. THE AUTHORS HAVE CARRIED OUT THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF LEGAL LIABILITY FOR MANIFESTATION OF CONTEMPT OF COURT RULES ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, FRANCE, AUSTRALIA, BELGIUM, POLAND, GREAT BRITAIN, NEW ZEALAND, IRELAND AND INDIA, WHICH ALLOWED TO HIGHLIGHT THE POSITIVE PROVISIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT OF LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING THE AFOREMENTIONED RESPONSIBILITY IS TO GUARANTEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, SAFEGUARDING THE CONTINUITY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF REGULATORY LEGAL ACTS AND THE JURISPRUDENCE OF SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, THE AUTHORS HAVE MADE THE CLASSIFICATION BY CATEGORIES OF ACTIONS THAT QUALIFY AS CONTEMPT.
439	THE PRESENT STUDY IS THE RESULT OF AN ANALYSIS THAT AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPLICATION OF A DEDUCTIVE SYLLOGISM, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE MEDIATION ACT MEET THE SAME REQUIREMENTS IN THE FORM OF AN ENFORCEABLE JUDGMENT TO HAVE THE SAME EFFECTS WITHOUT CONTRADICTING THE RIGHT TO DEFENSE AND DUE PROCESS. ALL THIS, BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT MEDIATION PROCESSES STRENGTHEN A CULTURE OF PEACE AND THEREFORE, IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THE ACTS DERIVED FROM THIS PROCESS HAVE THE FORCE OF ENFORCEABLE JUDGMENT, BUT TAKING CARE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT AN AGGRESSOR OF THE RIGHTS OF ANY OF THE PARTIES NEITHER IN THE PRESENT NOR IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS A DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH, WITH A QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND WHOSE ANALYTICAL METHOD REQUIRED OBSERVATION, DESCRIPTION, SEGMENTATION AND CRITICALITY TO REACH ITS RESULTS. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION LAW NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED AND EXTENDED IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE MEDIATION RECORDS MEET THE SAME FORMALITIES OF THE JUDGMENT EXECUTED IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SO THAT AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THEM, GUARDIANSHIP IS GUARANTEED. JUDICIAL EFFECTIVE STRICTLY.
440	THIS STUDY CONTRASTS WELL ESTABLISHED LIQUIDITY MEASURES, NAMELY VOLUME-BASED TURNOVER RATIO, RELATED PRICE-IMPACT AMIHUD (2002) CONSTRUCT AND THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL LIU (2006) INDICATOR ALONGSIDE THE LESMOND, OGDEN, AND TRZCINKA (1999) PROPORTION OF ZERO DAILY RETURNS METRIC IN EXPLAINING BID-ASK SPREAD PLUS COMMISSIONS COSTS. WE CONTROL FOR SIX CRITICAL FIRM GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS THAT IMPACT LIQUIDITY ALONGSIDE THE MARKET-BASED CONTROLS THAT ARE CONVENTIONALLY SOLELY INCLUDED IN THE LITERATURE. USING A UNIQUE SAMPLE OF 12 SUB SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) EQUITY MARKETS, NAMELY KENYA, MAURITIUS, ZAMBIA, ZIMBABWE, BOTSWANA, MALAWI, NAMIBIA, NIGERIA, GHANA, BRVM (COTE D'IVOIRE), AND THEN SOUTH AFRICA'S ALT-X AND MAIN BOARDS WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT STATE AND FOREIGN VENTURE CAPITALIST INVOLVEMENT IN FIRMS ENHANCES LIQUIDITY WHILE INVOLVEMENT OF FOREIGN PARTNERS, ENTREPRENEURIAL FOUNDERS, DOMESTIC VENTURE CAPITAL AND INCLUSION WITHIN AN EXTENDED BUSINESS OR FAMILY NETWORK HAS OPPOSITE EFFECT. THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE USE OF THE PROPORTION OF DAILY ZERO RETURNS MEASURE IN PREFERENCE TO OTHER MEASURES IN CAPTURING ILLIQUIDITY. FURTHERMORE WE FIND THAT LIQUIDITY IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THREE OF SIX WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WITH THESE BEING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW.

441	IN HIS ESSAY 'CRITIQUE OF VIOLENCE', WALTER BENJAMIN SUBJECTS VIOLENCE (GEWALT) TO A CRITIQUE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE CRITERION FOR VIOLENCE ITSELF AS A PRINCIPLE. HIS STARTING POINT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW-POSITING AND LAW-PRESERVING VIOLENCE. HOWEVER, THESE ARE FOR HIM INSEPARABLE AND SUBJECTED TO THE LAW OF HISTORICAL CHANGE: THE HISTORY OF THE LAW IS NOTHING BUT THE DIALECTICAL RISING AND FALLING OF LEGAL ORDERS. BENJAMIN'S ANALYSIS OF LEGAL VIOLENCE AND HIS CRITICISM OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACIES, THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES, SHOULD BE RELATED TO THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE POLITICS IN CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW STATES, AS THOSE ADVANCED BY BERNARD NOEL, PHILIPPE LACOUE-LABARTHE, JEAN-LUC NANCY AND JACQUES RANCIERE. FOR BENJAMIN, IT IS ONLY LAW-DESTROYING DIVINE VIOLENCE, WHOSE PRINCIPLE IS JUSTICE (GERECHTIGKEIT), NOT POWER (MACHT), THAT IS ABLE TO BREAK THIS CIRCLE AND OPEN UP A NEW ERA. DIVINE VIOLENCE IS, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY A PROVOCATIVE BUT ALSO AN EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC, EVEN DANGEROUS, CONCEPT, AS JACQUES DERRIDA, AMONG OTHERS, HAS CLAIMED. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS, THEREFORE, WHETHER THE CONCEPT OF DIVINE VIOLENCE HAS ANY REAL POLITICAL RELEVANCE IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA.
442	THERE IS A STANDARD ACADEMIC CONSENSUS THAT SEMI-PRESIDENTIALISM IS PERILOUS FOR NEW DEMOCRACIES. IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS BECAUSE SEMI-PRESIDENTIAL COUNTRIES RUN THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING DIFFICULT PERIODS OF 'COHABITATION' BETWEEN A PRESIDENT AND A PRIME MINISTER WHO ARE OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER, AND BECAUSE THEY MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF DIVIDED MINORITY GOVERNMENT THAT ENCOURAGE THE PRESIDENT TO RULE BY DECREE AND SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THESE TWO ARGUMENTS. IT FINDS VERY FEW CASES OF COHABITATION IN YOUNG DEMOCRACIES AND ONLY ONE CASE WHERE COHABITATION HAS LED DIRECTLY TO DEMOCRATIC COLLAPSE. BY CONTRAST, IT FINDS MORE CASES OF DIVIDED MINORITY GOVERNMENT AND MORE CASES WHERE DIVIDED MINORITY GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATIC FAILURE. HOWEVER, THE ARTICLE ALSO FINDS THAT YOUNG DEMOCRACIES HAVE SURVIVED DIVIDED MINORITY GOVERNMENT. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT, TO DATE, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE LONG-STANDING AND HIGHLY INTUITIVE ARGUMENT THAT COHABITATION IS DANGEROUS FOR NEW DEMOCRACIES. THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE MUCH NEWER ARGUMENT ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DIVIDED MINORITY GOVERNMENT. EVEN SO, MORE WORK IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA BEFORE WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT SEMI-PRESIDENTIALISM IS INHERENTLY PERILOUS.
443	COASTAL STATES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE AND UTILIZE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THEIR EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE (EEZ). BOTH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND NATIONAL LAWS OF COASTAL STATES INCLUDE NUMEROUS REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE AUTHORITY OF COASTAL STATES IN THE EEZ. THESE LAWS ARE KEY TO THE EFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE EEZ. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF THE AUTHORITY OF COASTAL STATES TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE EEZ. THE RESEARCH METHOD USED IS A NORMATIVE RESEARCH METHOD. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE THE LIMITS OF AUTHORITY AND THE PURPOSE OF THE AUTHORITY GRANTED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW. COASTAL STATES CAN MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND THUS REALIZE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE GRANTED SUCH AUTHORITY. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS FOR THE AUTHORITY OF COASTAL STATES TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE EEZ IS BASED ON SOVEREIGN RIGHTS. THE SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE EEZ IS EXERCISED FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES; THE STATES ARE REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FISHERY RESOURCES, NOT VIOLATE THE RIGHTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHETHER COASTAL, LANDLOCKED OR GEOGRAPHICALLY DISADVANTAGED.
444	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN MODULATING THE EFFECT OF ICT ON GOVERNANCE IN 53 AFRICAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2002 AND 2020. THE TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM) STRATEGY IS ADOPTED TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY PROBLEM. GOVERNANCE IS COMPUTED AS A COMPOSITE INDEX THAT ENCOMPASSES THE SIX INDICATORS OF THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY). ICT IS MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS USING THE INTERNET, MOBILE CELLULAR SUBSCRIBERS AND FIXED BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTION. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY REVEAL THAT THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA IS ENHANCED BY GROWTH IN ICT. THE FINDINGS FURTHER INDICATE THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ICT AND EDUCATION PROCURE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON GOVERNANCE. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVED THAT ICT STILL ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE FRENCH CIVIL LAW AND THE BRITISH COMMON LAW SYSTEM. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THE DESIGN OF POLICIES FOR ENHANCING E-GOVERNANCE AND ICT IN AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE USED AS PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM FOR QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
445	THE JUDICIARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CRUCIAL PART OF RULE OF LAW STATES AND OPEN SOCIETIES, GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO PROTECTION, IF NEEDED, TO PERFORM AND ESTABLISH JUSTICE IN GENERAL. TODAY, WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE A MORE FLEXIBLE AND MORE RESILIENT JUDICIAL MECHANISM AIMED AT ACHIEVING FAIR AND EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL AMID PANDEMICS, ARMED CONFLICTS, AND CRISES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE UKRAINIAN EXPERIENCE IN CIVIL JUSTICE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS WORTH ATTENTION FOR MANY REASONS. DESPITE THE SOVIET INHERITANCE'S WIDE-REACHING IMPACT ON LEGAL DEVELOPMENT, 30 YEARS LATER, NOVEL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN REALIZED IN THE NEW CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE OF UKRAINE. THEREFORE, IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE, PARTICULAR ATTENTION WILL BE DEVOTED TO THE DICHOTOMY OF THE RIGHT OF PROTECTION VS DISPUTE RESOLUTION AS THE MAIN AIM OF CIVIL JUSTICE EVOLUTION IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE. IN THE SECOND PART, WE WILL SUMMARIZE HOW TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE AMID COVID-19. COMPARING THE EXAMPLES OF UKRAINE AND AUSTRIA PROVIDED A BASIS FOR THE CONCLUDING REMARKS, WHICH ALLOW US TO CONTRIBUTE TO FURTHERING CIVIL JUSTICE EVOLUTION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
446	RECENT DEBATES ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN GREEN DEAL HIGHLIGHTS THAT POLLUTION COULD BE CONTROLLED USING CHANNELS OTHER THAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE ROLE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN REDUCING POLLUTION SHOULD BE CORRELATED WITH QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, WHICH COULD SUPPORT INITIATIVES FOR A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS THE RENEWABLE KUZNETS CURVE FOR 10 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD 2006-2019, USING ECONOMIC INDICATORS (INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, DOMESTIC CREDIT TO PRIVATE SECTOR AND LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY) AS CONTROL VARIABLES AND INDICATORS REFLECTING THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE (WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND GOOGLE TREND INDEXES ASSOCIATED TO KEY-WORD CORRUPTION IN EACH LANGUAGE). THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON TWO TYPES OF PANEL DATA MODELS: PANEL DYNAMIC OLS MODEL (PDOLS) AND PANEL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG MODELS BASED ON POOLED MEAN GROUP (PMG) ESTIMATOR. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS REDUCES POLLUTION IN BOTH THE SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN, WHILE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW SUPPORTS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE LONG-RUN. GOOGLE SEARCHES FOR CORRUPTION AS A PROXY FOR QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INDICATE THAT TGHG EMISSIONS HAVE IMMEDIATE AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS IN NOWCASTING POLLUTION.
447	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE ISSUE OF PRISON HEALTH FROM A "RULE OF LAW" PERSPECTIVE. IT PROBLEMATIZES WHETHER THE REALITY OF THE PRISON HEALTH SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO STATE THAT THE RULES ARE NOT RELEVANT TO THE CARE PROVIDED BY THE STATE TO PERSONS DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY AND WHETHER A PRISON HEALTH SYSTEM THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DISTRIBUTION OF BURDENS AND BENEFITS AT THE MARGIN OF THE FORMALLY VALID SYSTEM HAS EMERGED. THE STUDY IS RELEVANT AS IT SHOWS HOW THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS FAILED TO FULFILL ITS FUNCTION OF DESIGNING PUBLIC POLICY ON PRISON MATTERS. AT THE SAME TIME, IT REVEALS THE LACK OF REAL CONTROL OVER PRISON HEALTH. THE RESEARCH IS OF A MIXED TYPE, LEGAL, NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE, BASED ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE STATE, PROTECTED BY THE IDEOLOGY OF SUBSIDIARITY, IS INDIFFERENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL NORMATIVE STANDARDS THAT REGULATE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH OF PERSONS DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIBERTY, AND ALLOWS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM, DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE ACCESSIBLE TO CITIZENS IN GENERAL, LACKING LEGAL GUIDANCE, AND INSUFFICIENT TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH.
448	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EU'S ENLARGEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH EASTERN EUROPEAN APPLICANTS HAVE BECOME POSSIBLE TO A LARGE EXTENT BY THE INTRODUCTION OF OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT BY THE COMMISSION, WHICH ALLOWED INTEGRATION TO PROCEED DESPITE THE THREAT OF DEADLOCK. THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND PREPARATION, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE BETTER SEEN AS A CONSTANT SWITCHING BETWEEN THE TECHNICAL PARTS OF THE ACQUIS AND THEIR (POTENTIAL) POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE DEVELOPED IN AN ANALYSIS OF BULGARIA'S PATH TO ACCESSION. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IN THE DOMESTIC ARENA, THE SAME TENSIONS BETWEEN THE SEEMINGLY TECHNICAL CHARACTER OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND THEIR POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES CAN BE OBSERVED. THE ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT WHILE THE EMPHASIS ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND TECHNICAL ISSUES OBSCURED THE POTENTIAL POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES AND EFFECTS ON VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, STALLED REFORMS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OR THE JUDICIARY BELONGED TO THE REALM OF ITS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. RULE OF LAW DID NOT REFORM SIGNIFICANTLY DESPITE THE INTRODUCTION OF A SPECIAL TOOL OF POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY, THE EU'S COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM (CVM). THE POLITICIZATION OF ISSUES CHANGED OVER TIME, WITH SOME MEASURES AFFECTING POLITICAL CLEAVAGES MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER BULGARIA'S ACCESSION.
449	THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN SHAPING SOCIAL POLICY IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE NEW FORMS OF GOVERNANCE AND IN THE EXERCISE OF GOVERNABILITY OF DEMOCRATIC RULE-OF-LAW STATES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE EXAMPLE OF THE VALENCIAN LAW ON SOCIAL SERVICES, SPECIFYING THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND EXAMINING THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM VARIOUS SOCIAL ACTORS. THE PROCESS COVERED THE PERIOD FROM 2015 TO 2019 AND WAS CARRIED OUT OVER FOUR STAGES WITH A TRIPLE OBJECTIVE: 1) TO SECURE PARTICIPATION FROM THE RANGE OF ACTORS (CITIZENS, PROFESSIONALS, LOCAL ENTITIES, THIRD-SECTOR ENTITIES, EXPERTS) AND POLITICAL PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, RELYING ON THE RIGHT TO CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AS A CENTRAL ELEMENT 2) TO DEVELOP A SHARED, COMMON AND PLURAL BILL IN LINE WITH THE NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF CITIZENS; AND 3) TO ESTABLISH THE BASIS FOR A LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY. THE DEPUTY PRESIDENCY AND COUNCIL FOR EQUALITY AND INCLUSIVE POLICY (VICEPRESIDENCIA I CONSELLERIA D 'IGUALTAT I POLITIQUES INCLUSIVES) SELECTED SOCIAL WORK PROFESSIONALS WITH RECOGNISED BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO HEAD THE LEADERSHIP GROUP FOR THIS PURPOSE IN 2015.
450	I ARGUE THAT MODERN CRIMINAL LAW WAS CONSTITUTED TO RATIONALIZE AND HUMANIZE PUNISHMENT. TO DO SO, MODERN STATES NEED A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT PROTECTS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. IN THIS CONTEXT, CRIMINAL LAW PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS AGAINST ARBITRARY AND CRUEL PUNISHMENT BY CREATING VERY STRICT CONDITIONS ON THE USE OF PUNISHMENT AND BY LIMITING ITS ABUSE BY AUTHORITIES. PART II OF THE ARTICLE TRACKS THE EVOLUTION OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT AND ARGUES THAT CRIMINAL LAW ONLY CAME TO MATURITY WHEN CRIME WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM SIN DURING THE ENLIGHTENMENT. ONCE CRIME HAD BEEN FREED FROM ITS THEOLOGICAL SHACKLES, IT COULD BE RECONCEPTUALIZED AS ONE OF THE MAIN INSTRUMENTS OF THE STATE TO MAINTAIN THE SECULAR POLITICAL ORDER. PART III OF THE ARTICLE SKETCHES THE MAIN TRAITS OF A SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL LAW THAT AIMS TO MINIMIZE CRIME AND PUNISHMENT; IT ALSO PROMOTES PEACE AS THE HARMONY OF MIND - THAT IS TO SAY, A COLLECTIVE MENTAL STATE IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS CAN TRUST THE STATE TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH INTERPERSONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE IS REDUCED TO THE BARE MINIMUM AND PEOPLE CAN FOCUS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL FLOURISHING.
451	LEGISLATIVE POWER IN MODERN JURISPRUDENCE IS UNDERSTOOD ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN TERMS OF THE POWER TO MAKE NEW LAWS. HOWEVER, EARLY MODERN JURISTS, SUCH AS JEAN BODIN, REGARDED LEGISLATIVE POWER AS CONSISTING OF TWO FUNCTIONS, NOT ONLY THE POWER TO MAKE LAWS, BUT ALSO THE POWER TO UNMAKE OR ABROGATE LAWS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TWINNED NOTION OF 'MAKING AND UNMAKING' LAW IN BODIN'S THOUGHT - WHAT I CALL THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGISLATIVE SYMMETRY. I LOCATE THE SOURCE OF BODIN'S ANALYSIS IN HIS TECHNICAL USE OF THE ROMAN LAW OF OBLIGATIONS. WRITING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EARLY MODERN ERA OF LEGAL REFORM, BODIN RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR SOVEREIGN STATES TO FREE THEMSELVES, FOR REASONS OF EQUITY, FROM ENTRENCHED OSSIFIED LEGAL RULES OF ANTIQUITY. SOVEREIGN STATES SHOULD NOT, ACCORDING TO BODIN'S FRAMING OF THE ISSUE, BE BOUND BY THE DEAD HAND OF THE PAST. BUT AS I ARGUE, THE SOVEREIGN POWER TO EFFECT LEGAL CHANGE IS INTRODUCED NOT SO MUCH AS A DEFENCE OF ABSOLUTISM, AS IS COMMONLY THOUGHT, BUT OUT OF A DESIRE FOR REINFORCING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MODERN STATE.
452	IN THIS ARTICLE, I AIM TO QUALIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MORAL PHILOSOPHY OF KANT FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN DIGNITY, IN ITS CONTEMPORARY ACCEPTANCE. INDEED, I CONSIDER THAT ONLY QUICK AND NON-CONTEXTUALIZED READINGS OF KANT'S WRITINGS, MAY DEDUCE FROM THEM THE RECOGNITION OF AN INTRINSIC AND ABSOLUTE WORTH FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS. IN ORDER TO REACH THIS PURPOSE, I FIRST DEFINE THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE CURRENT PATTERN OF HUMAN DIGNITY. THE LATTER SEEMS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WITHIN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL FIELD (CORNERSTONE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND SUPERIOR PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW) AND THE AXIOLOGICAL SPHERE (INHERENT AND ABSOLUTE WORTH). THEN, I TRY TO MAP IF WE CAN FIND THOSE MEANINGS AND CHARACTERISTICS AMONG SOME QUOTED EXPRESSIONS THAT KANT MAKES OF "DIGNITY" AND OTHER RELATED FORMULAS ("END IN ITSELF", "HUMANITY"). THUS, WHEN THOSE NOTIONS ARE CONTEXTUALIZED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MOTIVATIONS AND OUTCOMES UNDERLYING AND RESULTING FROM KANT'S MORAL PHILOSOPHY, I COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT KANT WAS NOT INTERESTED IN THE WORTH OF HUMAN BEING (WITH ITS RESPECT AND RIGHTS) BUT RATHER IN THE AUTHORITY OF HIS PATTERN OF MORALITY.
453	THE PAPER EXPLORES THE LINK BETWEEN PENAL IDEOLOGY AND INTERNATIONAL TRIAL JUSTICE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SENTENCING. THE ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF PUNISHMENT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AS SUCH, LOSS OF FAITH, OR LACK OF MORAL EMPATHY BY INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES WITH THE IDEOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES OF PUNISHMENT COMPROMISES THE ABILITY OF CRIMINAL TRIALS TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY IN MAINTAINING THE 'RULE OF LAW'. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT MORE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE GIVEN EXPLAINING THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS THAT UNDERPIN PERCEPTIONS OF 'JUSTICE' IN SOCIOLOGICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE 'REALITY' OF SENTENCING, AND PROPOSES AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONCEPTUALISING THIS. ADOPTING THIS APPROACH, THE PAPER DRAWS ON EXAMPLES FROM NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE HEGEMONY OF PENAL IDEOLOGY AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION COMPROMISES THE ABILITY OF SENTENCING OUTCOMES TO RESONATE WITH THE TRIAL'S 'RELEVANT AUDIENCE'. THE PAPER THEN FOCUSES ON HOW PENAL IDEOLOGY INFLUENCES THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACTUAL BASIS FOR SENTENCING IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIALS, AND CONSIDERS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FOR THE PERCEIVED 'LEGITIMACY' OF INTERNATIONAL TRIAL JUSTICE.
454	EQUALITY, LIFE, LIBERTY, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, SECURITY, CIVIC DUTY, JUSTICE, HONOR, AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE SOME OF THE WIDELY HELD VALUES IN SOCIETY. THESE ARE THE VALUES ENGINEERS MUST ADOPT TO COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS A LACK OF AWARENESS IN CONSTRUCTION EDUCATION REGARDING HOW TO INTEGRATE SOCIAL AWARENESS AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOR INTO PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE. SEVERAL CHALLENGES FACING CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING EDUCATORS ARE HOW TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES THAT WILL RAISE THE AWARENESS OF STUDENTS REGARDING ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION AND HOW TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE ETHICAL DECISIONS. SOCIAL VALUES SHOULD SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR UNIVERSITY-LEVEL ETHICS INSTRUCTION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PAPER ARE TO DISCUSS THE VARIOUS DISCIPLINES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COURSE MATERIAL AND CLASSROOM PRESENTATIONS, AND TO DESCRIBE A FRAMEWORK FOR MAKING ETHICAL DECISIONS. PROBLEM SOLVING IN ETHICS IS A SKILL THAT IS VERY MUCH NEEDED BY STUDENTS, BUT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO TEACH. THE APPROACH DESCRIBED HEREIN USES REAL WORLD CONSTRUCTION ETHICS CASES AND INVITED GUEST LECTURES FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY PLUS MULTIPLE REQUIRED AND ELECTIVE COURSES EXPLORE ETHICAL THEORIES, CONCEPTS OF CRITICAL THINKING, AND MAJOR ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.
455	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MEANING OF THE KILLING OF FOUR PATIENTS WITH DISABILITIES ON THE LIFE CARE WARD OF TENET'S MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER IN NEW ORLEANS IN ANTICIPATION OF HURRICANE KATRINA. NONE WERE TERMINALLY ILL. NONE WERE IN PAIN. NONE KNEW THEIR LIVES WERE ABOUT TO END. NONE WERE EVACUATED. THE VICTIMS HAD ONE THING IN COMMON: THEY ALL HAD CHOSEN TO BE DESIGNATED AS DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) PATIENTS. ALL WERE KILLED WITH OVERDOSES OF MEDICATIONS THAT HAD NOT BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR THEM. DR. DANIEL NUSS OF THE LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DR. FLOYD BURRAS, PRESIDENT OF THE LOUISIANA MEDICAL SOCIETY DEFEND THE DOCTOR'S ACTIONS AS INVOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA OR MERCY KILLING. WAS THIS EUTHANASIA, OR HOMICIDE? AT MEMORIAL, THE TERM DNR TOOK ON A NEW MEANING-DO NOT RESCUE. IN THIS NEW MEMORIAL MODEL, PATIENT AUTONOMY TO CONTROL AND CHOOSE ONE'S MEDICAL TREATMENT, YIELDS TO THE PHYSICIAN'S UNILATERAL POWER TO ARBITRARILY DECIDE WHO LIVES AND WHO DIES. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS MUST OBSERVE THE RULE OF LAW, EVEN IN TIMES OF NATURAL DISASTER.
456	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES POLICING IN SIERRA LEONE FOUR YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. IT EVALUATES THE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE AREA OF POLICING AGAINST THE MAJOR POLICING CHALLENGES IN AFRICAN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. THESE ARE RECRUITMENT AND (RE) TRAINING OF A CIVILIAN FORCE; ESTABLISHING AN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIVE TO CITIZEN CONCERNS; ORGANIZATIONAL REBUILDING AND RE-EQUIPMENT; UTILIZING THE RESOURCES OF COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZED POLICING; AND ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE BASIS. THE RESEARCH FINDS THAT FOR ALL THE POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENTS, THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE STILL DOES NOT EXERT EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER, NOR IS IT ABLE TO DELIVER STATE POLICING SERVICES TO, SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF ITS OWN TERRITORY. THE 7,000 ACTIVE POLICE OFFICERS ARE TOO SMALL IN NUMBER AND TOO LIMITED IN RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ALL SIERRA LEONE'S CITIZENS WITH A SERVICE THAT PROTECTS THEM FROM CRIME AND INVESTIGATES CRIME. ITS FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESSES MEAN THAT POST-CONFLICT INTERNAL SECURITY PROGRAMMES MAY HAVE TO LOOK AGAIN AT OTHERS WHO CURRENTLY AUTHORIZE AND PROVIDE POLICING. IT MAY BE THAT SOME COMMUNITY LED POLICING GROUPS CAN BE HARNESSED AND IF NECESSARY REFORMED TO ASSIST THE POLICE IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW.
457	THE STORY OF THE LIBERAL AGENDA IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND OTHER 'SOCIETIES IN TRANSITION' IS A PROCESS INVOLVING A UNITY OF OPPOSITES - OF PARTICULARISM AND UNIVERSALISM; LOCAL NATIONALISM AND GLOBAL LIBERALISM. THIS ESSAY SUGGESTS A SET OF TOOLS WITH WHICH TO RE-EXAMINE THE WORK OF FOREIGN ACTORS ENGAGED IN 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'CIVIL SOCIETY' PROJECTS IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. THE ESSAY EXAMINES THREE ORIENTATIONS OF THE DOMINANT PARADIGM INFORMING THE WORK OF FOREIGN INTERVENERS AND ASSERTS COUNTER-ORIENTATIONS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CONVERGENCE TO A LIBERAL IDEAL; THE LIBERAL AGENDA CANNOT BE TRANSPLANTED WHOLESALE TO 'SOCIETIES IN TRANSITION' AS LOCALISMS, INCLUDING NATIONALISMS, CHALLENGE CLAIMS TO UNIVERSALISMS. BOTH LIBERALISM AND NATIONALISM HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE EITHER LIBERATORY OR OPPRESSIVE FORCES; HOWEVER, NO SOLUTION CAN BE VIABLE WITHOUT AN ACCOMMODATION OF BOTH. TO BETTER EXAMINE THE LIBERAL CAMPAIGN, THE ESSAY CHARTS THE ACTORS AT PLAY, THE RHETORIC THEY USE AND THE STAKES AT HAND. THE GOAL OF SUCH A MAPPING IS TO PROVOKE THE KIND OF INQUIRY THAT COULD CHANGE THE PLOT, OR AT LEAST GIVE SOME OF THE MINOR CHARACTERS A MORE MAJOR ROLE IN THE PRODUCTION.
458	THE YEAR 2021 MARKED THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF GUATEMALA'S LANDMARK PEACE ACCORDS. YET CELEBRATIONS OF THIS HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT STOOD IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE YEAR'S ALARMING TRENDS IN THE DETERIORATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. REVIEWING THE EVENTS OF 2021, THIS ARTICLE UNCOVERS TWO KEY PATTERNS IN GUATEMALAN POLITICS, BOTH EVIDENCE OF DEMOCRATIC DECLINE: 1) OPEN ASSAULTS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND BREACHES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, AND 2) AN ESCALATION IN THE CRIMINALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT CRITICS, PARTICULARLY THOSE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THE ANTI-CORRUPTION STRUGGLE. IT ALSO TAKES STOCK OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PATTERNS, INCLUDING THE ABYSMAL COVID-19 RESPONSE AND THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRUPTION AMID RESURGENT IMPUNITY. COMBINED, THESE DYNAMICS HAVE ALSO INCREASED TENSIONS WITHIN US-GUATEMALA RELATIONS AS THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE INCREASINGLY PERCEIVED THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT AS AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER IN TACKLING THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION. IN SUM, 2021 WAS AN INFLECTION POINT IN GUATEMALA'S 25-YEAR TRAJECTORY OF PEACE-ONE THAT HAS STEADILY SENT THE COUNTRY DOWN AN AUTHORITARIAN PATH LIKE MANY OF ITS NEIGHBORS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.
459	ONE OF THE REALIZATIONS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY IS THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH A LOCAL REGULATION. THE ESTABLISHMENT PROCESS SHOULD INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUTS BOTH IN ORAL AND WRITTEN FORM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ASPIRATIONAL LOCAL REGULATION. HOWEVER, IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL REGULATION THAT IGNORES COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IS OFTEN FOUND. THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RESEARCH USED A NORMATIVE LEGAL METHOD AND ANALYTICAL PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. THE THEORY EMPLOYED TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH PROBLEMS WAS THE THEORY OF DEMOCRACY. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL REGULATION IS NOT FULFILLED BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY'S IGNORANCE OF THE MECHANISMS AND THE FORMS TO PARTICIPATE. AS A RESULT, THE LOCAL REGULATION PRODUCED DOES NOT REPRESENT LOCAL PEOPLE'S ASPIRATIONS. A LOCAL REGULATION WHICH IS NOT ASPIRATIONAL IS DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT AND IS POTENTIAL TO BE CANCELLED THROUGH A JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN MAKING LOCAL REGULATIONS. SINCE ONE OF THE GOOD WAYS OF PRODUCING A LOCAL REGULATION IS THROUGH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE PROCESS.
460	ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN COUNTRIES THAT MOVE FROM STATE PLANNING AND REDISTRIBUTION TO MARKET EXCHANGE CREATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO UNCERTAINTY, BECAUSE MANY INTERDEPENDENT FACTORSMODES OF EXCHANGE, TYPES OF PRODUCTS, AND FORMS OF ORGANIZATIONSARE IN FLUX. UNCERTAINTY IS EVEN GREATER WHEN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS REMAIN AUTHORITARIAN BECAUSE THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK AND STATE BUREAUCRATS RETAIN POWER OVER THE ECONOMY. THIS STUDY OF LISTED FIRMS IN CHINA, WHICH HAS RECENTLY SEEN ECONOMIC TRANSITION BUT PERSISTENT AUTHORITARIANISM, SHOWS THAT IN SUCH CONTEXTS, FIRMS CAN REDUCE UNCERTAINTY BY DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH STATE BUREAUCRATS, WHICH HELP FIRMS LEARN HOW STATE BUREAUCRACIES OPERATE AND ENGENDER TRUST BETWEEN FIRMS AND BUREAUCRATS. TOGETHER, KNOWLEDGE AND TRUST STABILIZE OPERATIONS AND HELP PERSUADE BUREAUCRATS TO LIGHTEN REGULATORY BURDENS, GRANT FIRMS ACCESS TO STATE-CONTROLLED RESOURCES, AND IMPROVE GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT AS ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS PROCEED AND UNCERTAINTY INCREASES, BUSINESS-STATE TIES INCREASINGLY IMPROVE FIRM PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE TWO LIKELY CONTINGENCIES, INDUSTRY AND FIRM SIZE, AND TWO IMPORTANT CAUSAL MECHANISMS, ACCESS TO BANK LOANS AND PROTECTION FROM RELATED-PARTY LOANS, AND SHOW THAT THE VALUE OF BUSINESS-STATE RELATIONS VARIES OVER TIME, DEPENDING ON THE TRAJECTORY OF BOTH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.
461	GREECE IS THOUGHT TO SUFFER FROM WEAK IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW, INCLUDING WEAK LEGISLATIVE MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT, A SITUATION THAT UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW. IN RECENT YEARS, INCREASING IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO BETTER REGULATION, NAMELY THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION WITH REGARDS TO STATE FUNCTIONING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION OF BETTER REGULATION IN THE COMPLIANCE OF PUBLIC ENTITIES WITH BUDGETARY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE SURVEY WAS THE FIRST SUCH STUDY TO BE CONDUCTED IN GREECE, AND DISTRIBUTED QUESTIONNAIRES TO AUDITORS OF THE HELLENIC COURT OF AUDIT, WHICH IS THE SUPREME AUDIT INSTITUTION CHARGED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT EXTERNAL AUDITING OF PUBLIC ENTITIES AND THEIR EXECUTIVES. THE SURVEY RESULTS HAVE CONFIRMED THE SENSE OF WEAKNESS MENTIONED ABOVE, AS MOST RESPONDENTS CONSIDERED THE EXISTING LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TO BE UNCLEAR, A SITUATION THAT DETERRED COMPLIANCE. IMPROVED LAW DESIGN IS EXPECTED TO AMELIORATE COMPLIANCE BY PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES, WHICH APPARENTLY VIOLATE THE LAW MORE DUE TO ITS AMBIGUITY AND COMPLEXITY RATHER THAN TO ANY DELIBERATE INTENTION. THEREFORE, NON-COMPLIANCE SHOULD BE BETTER ADDRESSED THROUGH SIMPLIFICATION OF REGULATIONS RATHER THAN COERCIVE ENFORCEMENT.
462	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT AS IT HAS BEEN USED WITH REFERENCE TO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, MAPPING ITS RISE AND IMPACT BASED ON A SELECTION OF CASE STUDIES. IN RECENT DECADES, INTERNATIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ADVOCACY HAS EVOLVED DRAMATICALLY, WITH PRACTICE INCREASINGLY EMPHASISING THE CENTRALITY OF CRIMINAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR VIOLENCE, PRECISELY AS MORE HOLISTIC APPROACHES HAVE EMERGED THAT HAVE BROADENED THE REMIT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. POST-CONFLICT JUSTICE ADVOCATES HAVE THUS BECOME PROFESSIONALISED TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ENTREPRENEURS WORKING ON ISSUES SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. A LEGAL EMPOWERMENT DISCOURSE HAS EMERGED IN A NUMBER OF SCHOLARLY DEBATES THAT DISCUSS LEGALISTIC AND NORMATIVE ISSUES RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RETRIBUTIVE AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MECHANISMS. IN THEORY, THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN TRANSITIONS, INCREASING THE RIGHTS OF THE MARGINALISED. IN PRACTICE, HOWEVER, LEGAL EMPOWERMENT HAS DISAPPOINTED AND RAISES SEVERAL ISSUES AROUND ITS PERFORMANCE THAT ARE SCRUTINISED IN THIS ARTICLE. DRAWING ON CASE STUDIES IN NEPAL, TUNISIA AND BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA THE AUTHORS ANALYSE ISSUES RELATED TO AGENCY, INSTITUTIONS AND STRUCTURE, AND ARGUE FOR A NEEDS-CENTRED, PARTICIPATORY APPROACH IN PLACE OF THE RIGHTS-BASED LEGAL EMPOWERMENT CONCEPT.
463	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ACCUMULATIVE BAD GOVERNANCE OVER THREE DECADES OF MUBARAK'S REGIME REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY PEOPLE REVOLTED. BAD GOVERNANCE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FALL OF THE REGIME IN THREE FUNDAMENTAL WAYS: FIRST, IT CREATED THE CONDITIONS (SUCH AS RAMPANT CORRUPTION, VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW) THAT SERVED TO INSPIRE PUBLIC ACTION AGAINST THE RULERS; SECOND, IT LED TO THE BREAKDOWN OF CORE ELEMENTS CRITICAL FOR REGIME STABILITY (WITHIN THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE JUDICIARY FOR EXAMPLE) AND THIRD, IT CATALYSED THE MIDDLE-CLASS WHO PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN AGITATING FOR THE UPRISINGS VIA FACEBOOK AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, IN EXPOSING THE DYNAMICS OF BAD GOVERNANCE IN EGYPT, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONLY ONE OF GOVERNANCE GONE BAD BUT THE VERY GOOD GOVERNANCE PARADIGM PROMOTED BY INTERNATIONAL ACTORS. BY FOCUSING ON INSTITUTIONAL REFORM, THE GOOD GOVERNANCE PARADIGM DID NOT CAPTURE THE WAY IN WHICH ACTORS, PROCESSES AND VALUES BECOME DIFFUSE ACROSS THE STATE-SOCIETY DIVIDE. A RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE APPROACH WOULD BE MORE ANALYTICALLY USEFUL IN CAPTURING AND ENGAGING WITH SOME OF THESE DYNAMICS.
464	THIS PAPER EXAMINES ELECTION RIGGING AND ITS EFFECT ON DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN NIGERIA RELYING ON QUALITATIVE APPROACH, USING DATA GATHERED FROM SECONDARY SOURCES. IT WILL BE ANALYZED VIA CONTENT AND HISTORICAL ANALYSIS. ELECTION RIGGINGS IN NIGERIA HAVE DEALT A HUGE BLOW TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY IN NIGERIA. NIGERIA'S ELECTIONS SO FAR HAVE NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS DUE TO VARIOUS FORMS OF ELECTORAL MANIPULATIONS WHICH HAVE DENIED THE COUNTRY CREDIBLE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN HER BODY POLITIC. ELECTION RIGGING HAS NOT ONLY MARRED DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN NIGERIA BUT HAS ALSO VIOLATED THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT (RIGHT TO LIFE) OF SO MANY NIGERIANS. ELECTION RIGGINGS SINCE INDEPENDENCE REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER WILL BE OUR BENCH MARK. THE STUDY FOUND THAT ELECTION RIGGINGS IN NIGERIA HAVE RESULTED INTO THE IMPOSITION OF CORRUPT AND ILLEGITIMATE LEADERS WHO HAVE NO REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY WHICH ARE OFF-SHOOTS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS PAPER PROVIDES SOME IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD SERVE AS A PANACEA TO THE PROBLEMS OF ELECTION RIGGINGS AND HOW THOSE MEASURES CAN HELP NECESSITATE A DEMOCRATIC ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS A PRECONDITION FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS.
465	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT RECENT SUSTAINED CRITICISM OF JUDICIAL SENTENCING IN ENGLAND AND WALES REFLECTS A MUCH DEEPER MALAISE AFFLICTING THE LEGITIMACY OF PUNISHMENT IN THE LATE POST-MODEM ERA. IT SUGGESTS THAT THIS PHENOMENON NOT ONLY THREATENS THE LIBERAL-CONSENSUS VIEW OF THE JUDICIARY AS PIVOTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO UNDERMINES THE RATIONALITY WHICH UNDERPINS CONVENTIONAL PARADIGMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE MORE GENERALLY. THE PAPER GOES ON TO ARGUE THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM ENGAGING WITH THE DEBATES ABOUT PUNISHMENT AND SENTENCING WHICH ARE TAKING PLACE ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, SUGGESTING THAT THE CRISIS IN DOMESTIC SENTENCING IS REALLY SYMPTOMATIC OF A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CRISIS IN PENAL LEGITIMACY AFFECTING THE WHOLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY; ONE THAT TOUCHES UPON THE ROLE OF PUNISHMENT IN THE GOVERNANCE OF SO-CALLED DEMOCRATIC STATES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE TIME MAY HAVE COME TO MODIFY THE PREDOMINANT NEO-LIBERAL PARADIGM PREVALENT IN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES BY DEVELOPING NOTIONS OF PUNISHMENT AND SENTENCING AS RELATIONAL CONTEXTS WHICH PROVIDE MEANINGFUL LINKS BETWEEN TRIAL OUTCOMES AND ASPIRATIONS FOR JUSTICE.

466	AS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) EVOLVED AS AN INTERNATIONAL ACTOR IN THE 1990S, IT PLACED A COMMITMENT TO PROMOTE CERTAIN VALUES AT THE CORE OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY. THESE VALUES INCLUDE DEMOCRACY, AND ALONGSIDE OTHERS SUCH AS A RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, THEY HAVE RESULTED IN THE BRANDING OF THE EU BY SOME SCHOLARS AS A 'NORMATIVE POWER'. DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, IS BUT ONE OF MANY VALUES PROMOTED BY THE EU, AND MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE MOST IMPORTANT IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH TUNISIA, WHERE PRESIDENT ZINE EL ABIDINE BIN ALI AND THE RULING ELITE BASE THEIR AUTHORITY ON CLAIMS CHAMPIONING STABLE DEVELOPMENT, MODERNIZATION, AND PROMOTING SECULAR VALUES. POLITICAL ACTORS ADVOCATING DIFFERENT VALUES TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE SUPPRESSED IN THE NAME OF STABILITY, LEAVING LITTLE SPACE FOR A DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION TO DEVELOP. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT IN THE TUNISIAN CONTEXT, STABILITY IS NOW INCREASINGLY PREFERRED BY EU POLICY-MAKERS. THIS HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON BOTH THE POTENTIAL FOR EXTERNAL SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL REFORM IN TUNISIA, AND ON THE EU'S WIDER CLAIMS TO BEING COMMITTED TO THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY.
467	THERE IS A CLEAR PUBLIC INTEREST BENEFIT FOR LAWYERS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY ON THE PART OF THE VULNERABLE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW THAT THE SEEMINGLY SIMPLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS IN FACT MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT LOOKS. PRO BONO MAY BE VIEWED FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES-THAT OF THE LAWYER AND THAT OF THE CLIENT. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LAWYER, THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE IS ETHICAL MOTIVATION TO ENGAGE IN PRO BONO. IF, HOWEVER, THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CLIENT IS PARAMOUNT, THEN MEETING THE CLIENT'S NEEDS IS THE POINT OF PRO BONO, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LAWYER'S MOTIVATION. OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO PRO BONO LACKS COHERENCE BECAUSE WE EMBRACE BOTH PERSPECTIVES BUT SEEM UNABLE TO PROVIDE A SATISFYING ACCOUNT OF THE EXISTING PRO BONO POLICIES AND PROGRAMS UNDER EITHER VIEW. DESPITE THIS COMPLEXITY (OR, PERHAPS, BECAUSE OF IT, THE PUBLIC INTEREST APPROACH ALLOWS BOTH LAWYER AND CLIENT PERSPECTIVES TO INFORM AN UNDERSTANDING OF PRO BONO PUBLICO. AND, UNDERSTOOD IN A PUBLIC INTEREST PARADIGM, PRO BONO SERVES A VITAL AND NECESSARY ROLE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
468	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALTERNATIVE DISCOURSES ON ZAKONNOST' (LEGALITY) IN RUSSIAN POLITICS BETWEEN 1904 AND 1917. THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO DEFINE THE VARIOUS ORIGINS OF THAT LEGAL AND POLITICAL DOCTRINE AND LOCATE THE MODELS OF LEGAL REFORMS OFFERED BY RUSSIAN POLITICIANS FROM PETR SVIATOPOLK-MIRSKII TO PETR STOLYPIN WITHIN THE THEORETICAL AND SEMANTIC FIELD OF LEGAL DEBATES IN LATE NINETEENTH- AND EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY RUSSIA AND EUROPE. THE MEANINGS OF THE TERM ZAKONNOST' AS IT APPEARED IN LEGISLATIVE ACTS, GOVERNMENT RHETORIC AND LIBERAL IDEOLOGY PRECISELY CORRESPONDED TO COMPETING VISIONS OF THE IDEAL REGIME OF RULE OF LAW-EITHER THE CONSERVATIVE GERMAN RECHTSSTAAT OR THE SLAVOPHILE THEORY OF LEGAL MONARCHY, WHICH IN RUSSIAN CONTEXT BOTH SYMBOLIZED THE ALTERNATIVES TO CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY, OR THE LIBERAL DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PROGRAMS OF LEGAL REFORMS OFFERED UNDER THE SLOGAN OF "LEGALITY" IN THE 1904-1907 PERIOD IMPLIED VARIOUS INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS (THE REFORM OF THE SENATE, LOCAL COURTS AND ADMINISTRATION). THE ANALYSIS OF RUSSIAN LEGAL VOCABULARY AND DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE KEY LEGAL CONCEPT OF RUSSIAN POLITICS HELPS INTERPRET THE GOALS AND MEANING OF JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL REFORMS DURING AND AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF 1905.
469	EVIDENTIARY ASSESSMENT IN ASYLUM PROCEDURES IS AN AREA LARGELY UNREGULATED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW. WHILE THE EU QUALIFICATION DIRECTIVE DOES NOT PURPORT TO FILL THIS LACUNA, ITS ARTICLE 4 OFFERS A NORM THAT DOES TOUCH ON A NUMBER OF CENTRAL ASPECTS OF EVIDENTIARY ASSESSMENT. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS COMPLEX PROVISION AND ITS PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. AMONGST OTHERS, THE DIRECTIVE OBLIGES MEMBER STATES TO COMMUNICATE ANY INFORMATION THAT IMPACTS ON THE RELEVANCE OF THE APPLICANT'S STATEMENTS. THE PROCESSING OF INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE DISTINCT STAGES. THE FIRST DEALS WITH THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION, THE SECOND SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THE RELEVANCE OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APPLICANT AND TO ASSESS IT, WHILE THE THIRD CONCERNS EVIDENTIARY ASSESSMENT IN THE NARROW SENSE, CONSIDERING THE VALUE OF EVIDENCE AND BASING THE DECISION ON IT. IMPLICITLY, THE DIRECTIVE IMPOSES A DUTY ON THE AUTHORITIES TO IDENTIFY THE APPLICANT'S CLAIM, AND, CONCURRENTLY, THE THEMES OF PROOF FLOWING FROM IT. THIS MIGHT VERY WELL EXCEED PRESENT PRACTICE IN MEMBER STATES, AND WOULD THUS TRANSLATE INTO AN IMPROVEMENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AT LARGE.
470	THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ANALYSIS OF GOVERNANCE AS IT AFFECTS SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT, INCORPORATING ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH SOCIAL EQUITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNANCE HAS SEVERAL DIMENSIONS-POLITICAL, TECHNICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL. IT IDENTIFIES THE ESSENTIALS OF GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING THE CAPACITIES FOR EXERCISING AUTHORITY, SOLVING PROBLEMS, RESOLVING CONFLICTS, AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE IT EXAMINES TWO CONTEMPORARY MEGATRENDS: THE RISE OF OPEN MARKET ECONOMIES AND THE ADVANCE OF PLURALIST POLITICAL SYSTEMS. EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THESE ARE WINNING STRATEGIES FOR DEVELOPMENT, ALTHOUGH THEIR EVOLUTION WILL VARY BETWEEN COUNTRIES BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTORS. ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENT TO COMPLEMENT THESE MEGATRENDS CALLS FOR A BUSINESS-LABOR COALITION FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND A COMMITTED POLITICAL CONSENSUS. POPULISM AND POLITICAL REGRESSION ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO RAPID POLITICAL CHANGES. THESE CHANGES MUST BE ADDRESSED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTORS, THE STRENGTHENING OF KEY INSTITUTIONS TO ASSURE A CONCERN FOR SOCIAL EQUITY, AND A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SPECIFIC CASES, MANY OF THEM RELATED TO THE AUTHOR'S OWN EXPERIENCE IN CHILE.
471	THIS ARTICLE IS MOTIVATED BY THE RECENT DEBATE RAISED ON OKUN'S LAW REGARDING THE DIVERGENCE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF OKUN'S COEFFICIENT ACROSS COUNTRIES AND TIME HORIZONS, ITS ASYMMETRY AND NON-LINEARITY, AND THE METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF THIS LAW. WE TESTED THE PROPOSITION THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY-AS MEASURED BY GOVERNANCE INDICATORS-CAN EXPLAIN THIS DIVERGENCE AND NON-LINEARITY. WE ESTIMATED AN AUGMENTED VERSION OF OKUN'S LAW SHOWING THE NON-LINEAR RESPONSIVENESS OF UNEMPLOYMENT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN GDP IN THE PRESENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN A SAMPLE OF 88 DEVELOPING AND EMERGING COUNTRIES OVER THE 1985-2019 PERIOD. ESTIMATES ARE RUN USING THE 3SLS REGRESSOR. WE FOUND EVIDENCE CONFIRMING THAT THE RESPONSIVENESS OF UNEMPLOYMENT TO CHANGES IN OUTPUT IS ALL THE MORE REMARKABLE IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER INSTITUTIONS. WE SHOW THAT IMPROVING THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT-AS PROXIED BY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (GE), CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (CC), REGULATORY QUALITY (RQ), THE RULE OF LAW (RL), AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (VA)-IS AS IMPORTANT AS INCREASED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE STRATEGY OF REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT AND REACHING FULL EMPLOYMENT IN THESE COUNTRIES, WHICH IS ONE OF THE 17 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) ISSUED BY THE UNITED NATIONS.
472	ENSURING HUMANITARIAN LAW COMPLIANCE AND REPRESSION OF ITS VIOLATIONS RECEIVES CONSTANT REITERATION BUT TO MIXED EFFECT WHILE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL, JURISPRUDENTIAL AND INVESTIGATORY MODALITIES HAVE ADVANCED, REQUISITE STATE LEVEL COMPETENCIES EXHIBIT MARKED VARIABILITY. THIS PAPER DEVOTES MOST ATTENTION TO DISADVANTAGED STATES - THOSE THAT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, LACK THE JUDICIAL, INSTITUTIONAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO ENSURE HUMANITARIAN LAW COMPLIANCE AND REPRESSION OF ITS VIOLATIONS. HERE A PROFILE OF 46 STATES IS SELECTED FOR REVIEW, 20 OF WHICH ARE IDENTIFIED AS IMPACTED BY PREVIOUS OR CONTINUING FORMS OF ARMED CONFLICT. DATA FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT'S 2020 RULE OF LAW INDEX IS UTILISED. CHOSEN INDICATORS ASSESS INDIVIDUAL STATE LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, DUE PROCESS, AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORY CAPACITIES AS PERCEIVED AND RECORDED BY LOCAL PUBLICS AND INDIVIDUAL EXPERTS. A COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF THIS DATA REVEALS DIFFERENCES WITHIN PROFILES OF DISADVANTAGED STATES. THEY ARE INVESTIGATED TO BETTER COMPREHEND HUMANITARIAN LAW COMPLIANCE CHALLENGES FACING SUCH STATES. THEY INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, UTILISATION OF AMNESTIES, AND THE CONDUCT OF ARMED NON-STATE ACTORS. THE PAPER'S CENTRAL THESIS IS THAT HUMANITARIAN LAW COMPLIANCE, AND REPRESSION OF ITS VIOLATIONS, REMAINS INADEQUATE WITHOUT REMEDIATION OF THE CAPACITY IMPEDIMENTS EVIDENT IN DISADVANTAGED STATES.
473	PURPOSE THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON IPO INITIAL RETURN USING WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY ANALYSED 84 IPOS LISTED ON PAKISTAN STOCK EXCHANGE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2017 USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA. THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON IPO INITIAL RETURNS WAS EXAMINED USING ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, ROBUST LEAST SQUARE, STEPWISE LEAST SQUARE AND QUANTILE REGRESSION. FINDINGS EMPIRICALLY, THE VALUES OF POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY WERE POSITIVELY SIGNIFICANT, WHEREAS RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WERE NEGATIVELY SIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING THE INTENSITY OF IPO INITIAL RETURN. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THE PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT RISK IN THE MARKET. HENCE, INVESTORS WERE COMPENSATED WITH HIGHER INITIAL RETURNS FOR WEAK COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THAT IMPROVING COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WOULD IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL MARKET TRANSPARENCY, THEREBY REDUCING IPO INITIAL RETURNS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE NO STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED REGARDING THE INFLUENCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON IPO INITIAL RETURN IN PAKISTAN. THIS STUDY IS A PIONEERING STUDY THAT SEEKS TO GIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE LINK BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES IN THE CONTEXT OF PAKISTAN.
474	THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY STEMS FROM THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (UN-SDGS) AND THEIR IMPACT BY 2030. THE UN HIGHLIGHTS 17 SDGS THAT ADDRESS PERTINENT LOCAL AND GLOBAL ISSUES, ONE OF WHICH-SDG-10-HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO REDUCING INEQUALITY. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE NEXUS BETWEEN TRADE OPENNESS, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI), AND INCOME INEQUALITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA USING PANEL DATA FROM 2000 TO 2015 AND THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM) TECHNIQUE APPROACH. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FDI AND INCOME HAVE A NEGATIVE, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH INCOME INEQUALITY, SIGNIFYING THAT AS FDI AND INCOME PER CAPITA INCREASE, THE LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY DECREASES. HOWEVER, TRADE OPENNESS, EDUCATION, POLITICAL STABILITY, CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH INEQUALITY. THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, OFFERS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL HELP POLICYMAKERS. FIRST, DEVELOP GOOD POLICIES TO ATTRACT MORE FOREIGN INVESTORS, WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CREATING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGION. SECOND, CREATE MORE INFRASTRUCTURES TO PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY EDUCATION. THIRD, IMPLEMENT A GOOD POLICY TO MOTIVATE LOCAL PRODUCTION WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CREATING JOBS. FOURTH, BUILD A STRONG INSTITUTION(S) TO FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION.
475	IN GEORGIA V. PUBLIC.RESOURCE.ORG, INC., THE SUPREME COURT RESURRECTED A NINETEENTH-CENTURY COPYRIGHT DOCTRINE-THE GOVERNMENT EDICTS DOCTRINE-AND APPLIED IT TO STATUTORY ANNOTATIONS PREPARED BY A LEGISLATIVE AGENCY. WHILE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DECISION HAS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE COURT'S TREATMENT OF THE DOCTRINE RECOGNIZED AN INVIGORATED ROLE FOR COURTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COPYRIGHT LAW THROUGH THE USE OF PRINCIPLED REASONING. IN EXPOUNDING THE DOCTRINE, THE COURT ANNOUNCED A VISION FOR THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN COPYRIGHT ADJUDICATION THAT IS AT ODDS WITH THE DOMINANT APPROACH UNDER THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1976, WHICH SEES COURTS AS LIMITED TO INTERPRETING AND DEFERRING TO THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE. THIS PIECE UNPACKS THE LONGSTANDING DEBATE ABOUT JUDICIAL ROLE IN COPYRIGHT THAT MANIFESTED ITSELF RATHER VIVIDLY IN THE MAJORITY AND DISSENTING OPINIONS IN THE CASE. IN THE PROCESS, IT SHOWS HOW CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS'S OPINION FOR THE COURT CONSCIOUSLY UNRAVELED A DELICATE-BUT UNDESIRABLE-INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE THAT HAS COME TO BE ACCEPTED WITHIN THE WORLD OF COPYRIGHT LAW, AND IMAGINES THE CONSEQUENCES THAT IT MIGHT HAVE FOR THE FUTURE OF COPYRIGHT ADJUDICATION AND LAWMAKING.
476	THE MAIN ARGUMENT IN THE ARTICLE IS THAT LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE IDEA OF CONSTITUTIONALISM HAVE REMAINED CONTESTED IN THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE SINCE 1989. THE PREVALENT LITERATURE IN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE CHANGES IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE SINCE 1989 AS A TRANSITIONAL PROCESS IN WHICH LEGALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND HUMAN RIGHTS BECAME INCREASINGLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THE LIBERAL-CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT DID HOWEVER NOT FIND, IN FACT, WIDESPREAD ADHERENCE. MOST CONSPICUOUSLY SO IN HUNGARY (SINCE 2010), AND ALSO IN POLAND (SINCE 2015), THE POST-1989 CONSTITUTIONAL-DEMOCRATIC NARRATIVE HAS BECOME AN EXPLICIT POINT OF REFERENCE FOR CONSERVATIVE 'COUNTER-CONSTITUTIONAL' PROJECTS, WHICH SEEK TO UNDO SOME OF THE KEY PREMISES OF LIBERAL-CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. I HENCE ARGUE THAT THE POST-1989 TRANSFORMATIONS HAVE NOT ENDED AND CONTINUE TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY ENDURING CONTESTATION OVER CONSTITUTIONALISM, (FOUNDATIONAL) NORMS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL AS DIVERGING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE FINALITE OF THE POST-COMMUNIST PROJECT OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. A KEY FINDING IS THAT THE CURRENT POPULIST RESENTMENT TOWARDS POST-1989 LIBERAL DEMOCRATIZATION BUILDS TO AN IMPORTANT EXTENT ON CULTURALLY REARTICULATED LEGACIES OF NON-LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE UNDERSTANDINGS OF SOCIETY.
477	SELECTION MECHANISMS THAT COULD IDENTIFY THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE ARE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS, SPECIFIC COMPETITIONS FOR SENIOR SERVANTS AND SELECTION AVAILABLE ON THE LABOUR MARKET ARE THE FORMS OF MERITOCRACY, SO THE QUESTION IS NOT TO ABOLISH OR SUSTAIN THEM, BUT TO KNOW WHICH OF THEM THE MOST EXPRESSES TALENT, EFFORT, AND ACHIEVEMENT. AND THIS KNOWLEDGE IS THE AIM OF THIS PAPER. MERIT SEEMS INTUITIVELY THE BEST OPTION FOR THE SELECTION OF THE BEST PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES, BUT IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHICH FORM OF SELECTION IS THE BEST. HAVING THIS IN MIND, THIS PAPER BASED ON THE RECRUITING PROCESSES OF THE FIRST TWENTY RANKED COUNTRIES BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, GINI INDEX, CORRUPTION PERCEPTION AND PUBLIC INTEGRITY INDEXES SHOWS THE COMPETITION ON THE LABOUR MARKET SYSTEM OF RECRUITMENT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE; THEN FOLLOWS THE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION SYSTEM FOR SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS AND AS THE LAST (AND CONTRA INTUITIVELY) THE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION SYSTEM. BASED ON THE COUNTRY'S LOW GINI INDEX, RESULTS ALSO SHOW IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE COMPETITION ON THE LABOUR MARKET RECRUITMENT SYSTEM IS USED.
478	IN THIS STUDY, A THEORETICAL MODEL OF ECOSOCIAL CLIMAX IS DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE HUMAN COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO ENSURE EFFICIENT PROTECTION OF ECOSYSTEM. UNLIKE PREVIOUS WORKS THAT EMPHASIZE ANALYSIS OF NATURE, THE PRESENT MODEL IS BASED ON SUCH ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS AS ECOLOGICAL CHAIN AND CLIMAX TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEMS OF ECOSOCIAL SYSTEM. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS USED TO COMPARE THE TWO ECOSYSTEMS IN GEORGE ELIOT'S SILAS MARNER: THE ECOLOGICALLY PROBLEMATIC COMMUNITY OF LANTERN YARD, AND THE ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY OF RAVELOE COMMUNITY. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT GOVERNED BY CHECK AND BALANCE, NEGOTIATION AND CONCESSION, MORALITY AND MUTUAL CONTRACT, AND RULE OF LAW, RAVELOE IS A CLIMAX COMMUNITY THAT ENCOURAGES EQUALITY, INTERACTION AND EXCHANGE, ADAPTABILITY AND TOLERANCE, DIVERSITY AND WHOLENESS, DYNAMIC STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IT IS SHOWN THAT GEORGE ELIOT'S IDEAL SOCIETY IS ONE OF ECOLOGICAL SOCIAL ORDER WITH HARMONIOUS HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS FORMED IN HUMBLE RECONCILIATION WITH NATURE IN FEAR OF GOD SO THAT HUMANS DO NOT POSE AS THREAT TO THE EQUILIBRIUM OF NATURE. HOPEFULLY, THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH MIGHT PROVE HELPFUL TO ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN HUMAN SOCIETY TO CONTRIBUTE TO RECONCILIATION BETWEEN HUMANS AND NATURE.
479	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS USING PANEL DATA FOR LOW, LOWER-MIDDLE, UPPER-MIDDLE AND HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES FOR THE SAMPLE PERIOD OF 1996-2016 USING THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM). THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS CONFIRM THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FDI IN ALL GROUP OF COUNTRIES. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR FDI INFLOWS ARE GREATER IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THAN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS A MORE IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF FDI IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THAN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, GDP PER CAPITA, AGRICULTURE VALUE-ADDED AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP, AND INFLATION INFLUENCE FDI INFLOWS NEGATIVELY IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHILE GDP PER CAPITA, TRADE OPENNESS, AGRICULTURE VALUE-ADDED AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP, AND INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON FDI INFLOWS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. TRADE OPENNESS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP AND INFRASTRUCTURE POSITIVELY AFFECT FDI IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. FROM OUR ANALYSIS, WE INFER THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS A MORE IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF FDI IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THAN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
480	ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ITS CAUSES HAVE LONG BEEN EXPLORED IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE. MORE RECENTLY, THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IS ALMOST INSEPARABLE FROM THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF MODERN ECONOMIES. USING THE INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE AUTHORS HAVE RESEARCHED WHETHER INSTITUTIONS HAD AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF CROATIAN ECONOMY WHEN COMPARED TO SOME SELECTED EU MEMBERS. THE AUTHORS HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE HAD A MARKED IMPACT ON THE GROWTH, IN PARTICULAR WHERE THE INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEX HAVE BEEN ANALYZED. IT IS IN THESE AREAS IN PARTICULAR THAT CROATIA NEEDS TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL SHIFT IN ORDER TO STIMULATE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. IN ADDITION, OTHER FORMAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF OPENNESS, THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO THE IMPORTANCE OF ENCOURAGING THE CHANGE OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED, BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN CROATIA IS RELATIVELY HIGH. THE AUTHORS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT A STIMULATING INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE WILL TRIGGER AND LEAD TO POSITIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH PROCESSES.
481	GUARDIANSHIP AS A FAMILY-LAW INSTITUTE HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT, YET UNSOLVED ISSUE FOR DECADES NOW. THE LATEST FAMILY LAW REFORM OF 2014 AND 2015 BROUGHT CERTAIN CHANGES, WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AND ADVOCATED FOR AS A NEW CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE LEGAL POSITION OF ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES ON ONE HAND AS WELL AS THE LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE RULE OF LAW ON THE OTHER. THE CROATIAN FAMILY ACT PROCLAIMS THAT A PERSON CANNOT BE DEPRIVED OF LEGAL CAPACITY COMPLETELY, BUT ONLY PARTIALLY. ONE CAN ONLY WONDER - HOW CAN THIS PROVISION BE IMPLEMENTED IN CASES OF A COMA FOR INSTANCE? A WISE LEGISLATOR ALLOWS JUDGES TO BE FAR MORE THAN THE PURE EXECUTORS OF A PERSON WITH DISABILITES' INTENTIONS. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT A WISE JUDGE WHEN DECIDING UPON THIS ISSUE WOULD IN CERTAIN CASES BE ACTING CONTRALEGEM IF ATTEMPTING TO COHERENTLY PROTECT THE PERSON WITH DISABILITIES, WHICH CANNOT BE ACCEPTABLE. THEREFORE, IT IS THE AIM OF THIS PAPER TO SHED ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON THE NEWLY ADOPTED PROVISIONS OF THE FAMILY ACT AS REGARDS THE DEPRIVATION OF LEGAL CAPACITY, WITH THE GENERAL PREMISE THAT SUCH A LEGISLATIVE INTERVENTION IS NEITHER PROPORTIONAL NOR EFFICIENT.
482	THE EVOLUTION OF CRIMINAL LAW IN WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS IS OFTEN PORTRAYED AS A PATH LEADING FROM OBJECTIVE TO SUBJECTIVE NOTIONS OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY. BY EXAMINING THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOTIONS OF SUBJECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE FUNCTION OF A WRONGDOER'S SUBJECTIVE MENTAL STATE, IN BOTH ITS SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL ASPECT, AS AN ELEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF ATTRIBUTING CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY, REMAINS MUCH THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS IN ANTIQUITY. THIS IS INDICATED BY WHAT SUBJECTIVITY, AS AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION OF CULPABILITY (ACTUS NON FACIT REUM NISI MENS SIT REA), IS SAID TO IMPLY: THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL ACTS. ALTHOUGH THE NOTIONS OF INTENT AND MALICE AFORETHOUGHT ARE ATTESTED TO IN VARIOUS SOURCES ON ANCIENT ATHENIAN LAW, THERE ARE SEVERAL KINDS OF CASES IN WHICH THE ROLE PLAYED BY THESE ASPECTSTRADITIONALLY REFERRED TO AS MENS REA (GUILTY MIND)REMAIN UNSOLVED IN CONTEMPORARY JURISPRUDENCE AND LEGAL PRACTICE. YET DESPITE THE DIFFICULTIES OF ESTABLISHING FACTS IN PARTICULARLY COMPLEX CRIMINAL CASES, SETTING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL REMAINS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THUS IN DISTINGUISHING THE LICIT FROM THE ILLICIT, WHICH IS THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
483	WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL COMPARATISTS MAY BE TALKING THE SAME LANGUAGE WHILE SAYING (OR THINKING) DIFFERENT THINGS, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COMMUNICATION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OF COMPARATIVE ENDEAVOURS MAY SUFFER SERIOUSLY UNDER UNARTICULATED CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION. IT HAS BECOME IMPORTANT, IF NOT ESSENTIAL IN THIS ERA OF ESCALATING TRANS-NATIONALISM, GLOBALISATION AND COMPARATIVISM, TO CONFRONT THE REALITY OF THE VARIANCE OF MEANING HIDDEN UNDER IDENTICAL OR HOMONYMIC CONSTITUTIONAL TERMINOLOGY. AVOIDANCE OF THIS ISSUE QUIETLY BEGETS CONFUSION IN THE EVER-INCREASING INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEGAL DISCOURSE. THE SUCCESS OF LIBERAL THEORY IN ESTABLISHING THE TERMINOLOGICAL STANDARD FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE IS ADDRESSED BEFORE THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE POPULAR PHRASE 'WE, THE PEOPLE', THE SOCIAL CONTRACT, THE STATE, DEMOCRACY, SOVEREIGNTY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW JURISDICTION ARE BRIEFLY PROBED. WITH REFERENCE TO CERTAIN PARADOXES IN CONSTITUTIONAL THINKING AND EXPLANATIONS FOR ENTRUSTING AUTHORITY TO THE STATE, THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL CHALLENGES FACING CONSTITUTIONAL COMPARATISTS ARE ADDRESSED, FOLLOWED BY A SUGGESTION FOR FINDING A MEASURE OF RELIEF FROM THE CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION BY MEANS OF A COMPARATIVE INSTRUMENT. IDENTIFICATION OF THE TERMINOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES REVEALS THE NEED FOR RENEWED INVESTIGATION INTO A RANGE OF FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES, EXPLICITLY APPROACHED FROM DIVERGENT POINTS OF DEPARTURE.
484	MANY THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN TURKEY WITHIN THE LAST DECADE, BUT ALSO IN BRUSSELS AS TO THE POLITICAL PRACTISES. THIS COMMENTARY SEEKS TO ANSWER WHETHER TURKEY AND THE EU CAN FIND AND MAINTAIN A SENSIBLE BALANCE BETWEEN TOUGHNESS AND EMPATHY, BETWEEN CONSIDERATIONS OF HARD POWER AND SOFT POWER TURKEY IS OBVIOUSLY AN ESSENTIAL, REGIONAL PLAYER BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND MILITARILY. GEOPOLITICS MAY NOT APPEAR HIGH ON THE AGENDA OF THE EU, BUT THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE-EAST SIMPLY COULD NOT AND CANNOT BE IGNORED AS A GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGE, ONE THAT MIGHT BEG FOR ACTING IN CONCERT WITH TURKEY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, EUROPE REPRESENTS AN ATTRACTION AND EXAMPLE BASED ON A LONG HISTORY AND STRUGGLE FOR MATERIAL WEALTH, TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AS WELL AS FOR THE ACCOMPLISHED DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. MORE RECENTLY, HOWEVER, EU SOFT POWER SUFFERS A NUMBER OF SETBACKS. WE DISOWN OUR MOST BASIC VALUES OF SOFT POWER AND WILL LOSE IMPACT IN PROMOTING A JUST, DEMOCRATIC ORDER IN THE WORLD IF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES FAIL TO RECOVER FROM THIS SET-BACK, WE RISK TO FALL BACK IN THE HARD POWER GAME, ALSO WITH POTENTIAL AND ASPIRING STATES.
485	EVALUATIVE AND NORMATIVE TERMS AND CONCEPTS ARE OFTEN SAID TO BE 'ESSENTIALLY CONTESTABLE'. THIS NOTION HAS BEEN USED IN POLITICAL AND LEGAL THEORY AND APPLIED ETHICS TO ANALYSE DISPUTES CONCERNING THE PROPER USAGE OF TERMS LIKE DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, GENOCIDE, RAPE, COERCION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ALSO THOUGHT THAT ESSENTIAL CONTESTABILITY TELLS US SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT THE EVALUATIVE IN PARTICULAR. GALLIE (WHO COINED THE TERM), FOR INSTANCE, ARGUES THAT THE CENTRAL STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF ESSENTIALLY CONTESTABLE CONCEPTS SECURE THEIR EVALUATIVENESS. I'LL ARGUE THAT THESE (WIDELY HELD) CENTRAL FEATURES ARE EXEMPLIFIED BY MANY EVALUATIVE AND NON-EVALUATIVE TERMS ALIKE, OWING TO MORE GENERAL FACTORS (SUCH AS MULTIDIMENSIONALITY) WHICH HAVE NOTHING IN PARTICULAR TO DO WITH BEING EVALUATIVE. THE ROLE OF THESE FACTORS IN SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION IS SUBJECT TO A CERTAIN KIND OF 'METASEMANTIC' DISPUTES WHICH HAVE THE FEATURES OF THE DISPUTES CHARACTERISTICALLY ADMITTED BY ESSENTIALLY CONTESTABLE CONCEPTS (WHETHER EVALUATIVE OR NOT) AND WHICH CAN BE SIMILARLY SUBSTANTIVE AND WORTHWHILE. IN CLOSING I'LL DISCUSS HOW MY ARGUMENT SHOWS THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF EVALUATIVE DISAGREEMENT NEEDS REFINEMENT. THE OVERALL UPSHOT IS THAT ESSENTIAL CONTESTABILITY SHOWS NOTHING DEEP OR DISTINCTIVE ABOUT THE EVALUATIVE IN PARTICULAR.
486	POSITIVE LAW OR A LEGAL SYSTEM AS A CLOSED LOGICAL SYSTEM HAS ITS OWN INNER COHERENCE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF A SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF NORMS WHICH LEAD CONCEPTS AND CONCEPTIONS, AT LEAST IN THEORY, IS THE GUARANTEE OF OBJECTIVENESS OR IMPARTIALITY (THUS 'RULE OF LAW') OF A LEGAL SYSTEM. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THE FIRST DECADE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HOWEVER, LEGAL THEORY WAS DOMINATED BY A KIND OF REDUCTIONISM. IT REDUCED THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO LOGICAL COHERENCE. EXAGGERATING THE LOGICAL ELEMENT, IT NEGLECTED OTHER ASPECTS OF LAW - NAMELY SOCIAL REALITY AND ETHICS. THE FIRST REACTIONS WERE IMPORTANT BUT THEY DEPENDED COMPLETELY ON TEMPORARY SOCIAL OR JUDICIAL NEEDS AND WERE UNSYSTEMATIC. THE SECOND PHASE WAS NOT ONLY A REACTION BUT ALSO GAVE BIRTH TO A NEW SCIENCE, THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW. SO SOCIOLOGY OF LAW HAS TO HAVE TWO OPPOSITE ASPECTS: FIRST, IN ORDER TO PREVENT LEGAL SYSTEMS BEING WITHDRAWN IT ALWAYS HAS TO BE CRITICAL AND SECOND, TO HELP SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS IT HAS TO BUILD UP A STRONG THEORETICAL BASE.
487	THERE ARE REPEATED CLAIMS THAT THE POLICE IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC), I.E. GONGAN (POLICE) OR JINCHA (PUBLIC SECURITY) ABUSE THEIR LEGAL POWERS. THIS HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPERVISION AND A FAILURE OF LEGAL CONTROL OVER THE PROPER EXERCISE OF POLICE POWER. MOST TELLINGLY, A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE PRC CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CONSIDER THE CURRENT LEGAL PROCEDURES REGULATING POLICE POWERS AS A BURDEN AND WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. PARTICULARLY, THE POLICE THINK THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO GET CORRECT RESULTS THAN TO ABIDE BY PROCEDURE RULES, I.E., "ZHONG SHITI QINGCHENXU" (EMPHASIZE SUBSTANCE AND SLIGHT PROCEDURES). POLICE STUDIES IN THE U.S. SUGGESTED THAT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF POLICE ABUSE OF POWER IS BEYOND THE LACK OF ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGAL CONTROL; THEY POINT TO LARGER SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND CULTURAL FORCES AT WORK. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES TWO CULTURAL REASONS -- THE LACK OF AN ENTRENCHED LEGAL CULTURE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ABSENCE OF AN INGRAINED CONSTITUTIONAL SPIRIT IN LIMITED GOVERNMENT -- IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN PRC POLICE ABUSE OF POWER.
488	COLOMBIA'S CURRENT DEMOCRATIC SECURITY POLICY AIMS TO RE-ESTABLISH INTERNAL ORDER AND TO PROTECT THE CIVILIAN POPULATION FROM THE DEPREDATIONS OF ILLEGAL, ARMED ORGANIZATIONS, WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DISTINGUISHES ITS 'GET TOUGH' STRATEGY, WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED WITHIN INSTITUTIONAL PARAMETERS, FROM PREVIOUS NATIONAL SECURITY APPROACHES, IN WHICH UNCHECKED POWERS LED TO ABUSES AGAINST SOCIETY, THE ACTUAL POLICY CONTENT CONTINUES TO PRIVILEGE A CONVENTIONAL MILITARY APPROACH TO SECURITY PROBLEMS. GIVEN THE CRITICAL LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND INSTABILITY IN COLOMBIA, HOWEVER, I SUGGEST THAT THE OVERALL STRATEGIC ORIENTATION THAT EMPHASIZES LAW, ORDER, AND STATE AUTHORITY OVER INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING IS APPROPRIATE IN THE SHORT RUN. A COMPREHENSIVE, VIABLE SECURITY MODEL MUST INCORPORATE THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL SAFETY FOR SOCIETY AND STATE, INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, AND SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, YET COMPLEX SECURITY EMERGENCIES SUCH AS COLOMBIA'S WARRANT PRIORITIZING THE PUBLIC ORDER COMPONENT OF THE SECURITY TRIPOD. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY WITH SECOND-ORDER INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS SO AS TO LEGITIMATE ITS SECURITY POLICIES AND MAKE THEM SUSTAINABLE IN THE MID AND LONG TERM.
489	DECIPHERING THE HIDDEN POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS IN LEGAL DISCOURSE HAS BECOME HOT FOCI IN THE STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS TO UNRAVEL THE POLITICAL ROLES AND POSITIONINGS OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN LAW AS WELL AS ITS ENFORCEMENT AND ADJUDICATION. DRAWING ON CDA APPROACH, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A TEXT MINING OF 12 EXTRADITION HEARINGS ON MENG WANZHOU CASE. THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT THE CASE IS IN THE NAME OF LAW BUT ACTUALLY WITH THE NATURE OF POLITICS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES EVIDENCE OF MANIPULATION OF POLITICAL POWER AND REFRAMING OF THE EVENT OCCURRENCES THROUGHOUT THE TEXTS OF THE 12 HEARINGS, BY EXERTING THE REPETITIVE USE OF A BUNDLE OF LEGAL DISCURSIVE STRATEGIES. THE VIOLATION OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY IN THE LEGAL DISCOURSE AROUND THE PRESENT CASE IS BASED ON THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THE U.S. IN CONTRAST WITH CANADA IN THE DISCURSIVE PRACTICES AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL CONTEMPLATION OF CANADA, RESULTING IN CHALLENGES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW AROUND THE WORLD. THIS RESEARCH FURTHERS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRATEGIES AND ENTANGLEMENT OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE, POWER AND CONTROL IN THE PROCESS OF DISCOURSE CONSTRUCTION.
490	THE NEED TO ATTRACT RESOURCES TO SOCIALLY SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES, DECENTRALIZE AUTHORITY, MARKET ORIENTATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITION REQUIRES THE SEARCH FOR A COMBINATION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MODERN APPROACHES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIALLY IMPORTANT PROJECTS. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED THE DEGREE OF IMPACT OF THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND BUSINESS, AS A MECHANISM OF DECENTRALIZATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, ON THE FACTORS OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH INVOLVED THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH ON SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP BY IDENTIFYING AND COMPARING KEY FACTORS OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY; DETERMINATION OF VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THEM, AND CONDUCTING ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF ESTABLISHED VARIABLES. IT IS PROVED THAT IN ADDITION TO OVERCOMING THE BUDGET DEFICIT, CONTRIBUTING TO ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP INVOLVES SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS) IS FOUND TO HAVE IMPACT ON INNOVATION, THE ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH CARE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES. THERE IS A NEED TO CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH WITH AN EXPANDED NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND FACTORS THAT DESCRIBE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.
491	LAWYERS DEFENDING EXTRACTIVE CORPORATIONS IN TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CASES TEND TO REFLECT THE DOMINANT 'RESOLUTE ADVOCACY' MODEL OF LITIGATION, WHICH DIRECTS LAWYERS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE CLIENTS' INTERESTS THOUGH ALL AVAILABLE MEANS. IS A DIFFERENT VISION OF ADVOCACY MORE APPROPRIATE IN THIS CONTEXT? IN ANSWERING THIS QUESTION, WE LOOK TO THE RULE OF LAW FOUNDATION OF THE 'RESOLUTE ADVOCACY' MODEL AND NOTE THE WAYS IN WHICH RATIONALES FOR AGGRESSIVE LITIGATION BEHAVIOUR ARE PRAGMATIC, CONTEXTUAL AND CONTINGENT. FROM THIS OBSERVATION, WE PROPOSE A MODEL OF 'MODERATED RESOLUTE ADVOCACY'. WE GROUND THIS CLAIM IN THE BACKGROUND CONTEXT GENERATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND IN THE BARRIERS THAT PLAINTIFFS FACE. THE MODEL WE PROPOSE WOULD NOT ONLY EMPHASISE EXISTING OBLIGATIONS ON LAWYERS NOT TO GENERATE UNREASONABLE COSTS, CREATE UNDUE DELAY OR ADVANCE UNFOUNDED LEGAL CLAIMS BUT ALSO PROMOTE AN APPROACH TO LITIGATION ORIENTED TOWARDS THE EFFICIENT DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS ON THEIR MERITS. TO OPERATIONALISE THIS MODEL, WE PROPOSE A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH THAT INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VOLUNTARY LITIGATION CODE OF CONDUCT ALONGSIDE LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO REMOVE SOME OF THE LEGAL OBSTACLES FOR PLAINTIFFS BRINGING THESE CASES.
492	THIS ARTICLE USES PIERRE BOURDIEU'S FIELD THEORY TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTER-NARRATIVE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IN POLAND. IT ARGUES THAT SYSTEMIC FEATURES OF THE EU FIELD OF POWER INDUCE POLITICAL ACTORS IN THE IN-BETWEEN MEMBER STATES TO DEVELOP TWO TYPES OF NARRATIVES. THESE NARRATIVES ARE AIMED AT DEALING WITH THE STATE'S PERCEIVED LOWER STATUS IMPOSED BY THE HEGEMONIC NARRATIVE PRODUCED BY THE FIELD'S DOMINANT ACTORS. WHEREAS THE ADAPTIVE STRATEGY OF AN ASPIRING SAINT HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE HEGEMONIC PRO-INTEGRATION NARRATIVE, CONTESTATION OF EXISTING POWER RELATIONS HAS BEEN LEGITIMIZED BY MEANS OF A DISILLUSIONED REBEL COUNTER-NARRATIVE, WHERE CORRECTION INTO NORMALITY DEFINED BY ESTABLISHED EU MEMBERS IS REPLACED WITH THE NEW NORMAL AS DEFINED BY THE CONTESTANTS. EMPIRICALLY, THE ANALYSIS OF HEGEMONIC NARRATIVE AND COUNTER-NARRATIVE PRODUCTION IN POLAND IS BASED ON THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SPEECH ACTS PRODUCED IN THE YEARS 2011-2020 BY POLITICIANS AND OFFICIALS WITH REGARD TO THE EUROZONE, MIGRATION, RULE OF LAW AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CRISES. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN POLICY AND IDENTITY (COUNTER-) NARRATIVE, BUT ALSO SHOW HOW NARRATIVE ENTREPRENEURS USE THEIR STORIES TO APPEAL TO DOMESTIC AND EUROPEAN AUDIENCES.
493	THE ABILITY TO CLAIM AN EMINENT RIGHT OVER PROPERTY WAS CENTRAL TO THE PARLIAMENTARY WAR EFFORT. RELYING ON A NARRATIVE OF NECESSITY THAT JURISTS IN BOTH ENGLAND AND IN WESTERN EUROPE HAD INCREASINGLY USED SINCE THE END OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, MPS GAVE THE ENGLISH POLITICAL PUBLIC A NARRATIVE PARALLEL TO THAT OF A BEGGAR IN EXTREME DURESS: IN ORDER FOR IT TO SURVIVE, THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ENGLISH SUBJECTS NEEDED TO GIVE WAY. SCHOLARS HAVE NOTED THE LONG PARLIAMENT'S USE OF NECESSITY IN THE PAST IN ORDER TO DISASSOCIATE THE CAUSES OF THE CIVIL WAR FROM A 'RULE OF LAW' IDEOLOGY OR TO MAKE A CLAIM THAT PARLIAMENT MADE A NOVEL POLITICAL THEORY OF EMERGENCY. YET THE LONG PARLIAMENT WAS NOT ABANDONING ENGLISH LAW NOR WAS IT GENERATING A NOVEL THEORY OF EMERGENCY. INSTEAD, IT WAS RELYING ON LEGAL CONCEPTS THAT JURISTS AND CROWN OFFICIALS COMMONLY USED TO ADVANCE THE POWER OF THE STATE. THIS LAW OF NECESSITY WAS CONTROVERSIAL, HOWEVER, AND THE LONG PARLIAMENT'S CONTINUED USE OF IT GENERATED CONFLICT EVEN AS IT ALSO ENABLED MPS TO SEIZE CONTROL OVER ENGLAND'S ARMED FORCES.
494	THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE LIBERAL STATE IN MARKET SOCIETY PRESENTS AN INHERENT TENSION BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND DEMOCRACY. IT SHOWS HOW THE TRADITION OF LIBERAL POLITICAL ECONOMY PROVIDES FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL FORM THAT SUPPORTS SPECIFIC AND CONTESTABLE VALUES, RELIES ON DEPOLITICISING THE FOUNDATION OF THOSE VALUES (ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE BASES OF COMMERCIAL SOCIETY), AND THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY - ENSHRINED IN THE RULE OF LAW AND BACKED BY THE FORCE OF LAW. THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THIS HAS BEEN POORLY MEDIATED IN MAINSTREAM DISCOURSE, BUT THAT MOORE AND LLOYD'S V FOR VENDETTA PROVIDES AN ASTUTE VERNACULAR CRITIQUE OF THE LIBERAL STATE BY DEVELOPING CLEARLY RECOGNISABLE ALLEGORIES OF THATCHERITE POLITICAL ECONOMY THAT ILLUSTRATE THE FORMAL NATURE OF JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY UNDER THE LIBERAL STATE FORM. THE PAPER MAKES THE SPECIFIC CLAIM THAT V FOR VENDETTA CAN BE READ AS A SIGNIFICANT CRITIQUE OF THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE LIBERAL STATE, AND THE MORE GENERAL CLAIM THAT CULTURAL ARTEFACTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE, ECONOMY, AND SOCIETY IN KEEPING WITH THE TRADITIONS OF THE 'NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY'.
495	THE CRIMES OF POSSESSION ARE ANALYZED AS A POLITICAL-CRIMINAL EXPRESSION OF THE "EFFECTIVIST" IDEOLOGY OF GLOBALIZATION CRIMINAL LAW AND ALSO OF PREVENTIVE JUSTICE. IT IS REVEALED, THEN, THE PRETENSION OF THE PUBLIC POWER TO APPROXIMATE CRIMINAL LAW TO POLICE LAW TO REACH REDUCED CRIME RATES. IN THIS WAY, THE TYPICAL STRUCTURES OF POSSESSION OFFENCES FACILITATE THE CONVICTION PURSUED BY THE ACCUSATION, INVERTING, TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE BURDEN OF PROOF, THUS WEAKENING THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE. THIS REALITY FORCES THE INTERPRETER OF THE LAW TO APPLY A GREATER TECHNICAL-LEGAL DEFINITION OF THESE INFRACTIONS IN ORDER TO ADAPT THEM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. UNDER THIS PREMISE, THE VALIDITY OF THE ACT REQUIREMENT IS AFFIRMED, REQUIRING THE VERIFICATION OF A PREVIOUS HUMAN CONDUCT AND NOT OF A MERE STATE OR SITUATION. AND THE OBJECT OF HARM IS BASED OBJECTIVELY ON THE ABSTRACT AND APPROPRIATE RISK TO THE PROTECTED LEGAL INTEREST AND NOT ON THE SUBJECTIVE DANGEROUSNESS OF THE PERPETRATOR. FINALLY, THE DEFINITION OF CRIMES OF POSSESSION AS PERMANENT OFFENCES APPROACHES THEIR ITERATIVE NATURE TO THEIR HARMFUL NATURE, PLACING A LIMIT ON AN UNJUSTIFIABLE RESTRICTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF THE CITIZEN.
496	WHEN MOST OF CHINA'S MAJOR CITIES ARE SUFFERING FROM SMOG, PEOPLE START TO CRY OUT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) HAS BECOME ONE OF THE HOTTEST TOPICS IN CHINA. CSR AND SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY ARE WIDELY DEBATED IDIOSYNCRATIC AREAS OF CORPORATE LEGISLATION. CHINA'S APPROACH HAS THUS FAR BEEN UNCLEAR IN BOTH AREAS. THIS PAPER FIRST CONSIDERS ALL RELATED PROVISIONS IN CHINESE COMMERCIAL LAW IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY CHINA'S APPROACH (LAW ON THE BOOKS) FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE. THEN, BASED ON THIS CONCLUSION OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIC CHINESE CORPORATE LAW, IT FURTHER EXAMINES THE ENFORCEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY AND CSR LAWS USING EMPIRICAL METHODS (LAW IN ACTION). FINALLY, THE EFFICACY OF THE CURRENT APPROACH IS ANALYSED AND ASSESSED FROM A POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT IT WOULD BE EFFICIENT FOR CHINA TO FOLLOW EXISTING STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND IMPERATIVES. MOREOVER, CHINA MUST CORRECT PRACTITIONERS' MODUS OPERANDI IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES SHOULD, FOR THE TIME BEING, BE TACKLED OUTSIDE THE CORPORATE LAW BOX RATHER THAN BY MEDDLING WITH ALREADY CONFUSING DIRECTOR DUTIES.
497	HOBBES' ACCOUNT OF POLITICS, LAW, AND OBLIGATION HAS LONG BEEN READ, ESPECIALLY BY REALISTS IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AS LEAVING NO SPACE FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW OR INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A MORE NUANCED READING OF HOBBES' IDEAS ABOUT LAW AND POLITICS PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR NOT ONLY A DEFENSE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT A DEFENSE OF A (CHASTENED) GLOBAL CONSTITUTION. HOBBES' CONSTITUTIONALISM DOES NOT DERIVE FROM A SEPARATION OR BALANCE OF POWERS BUT ON TWO OTHER ELEMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CENTRALITY OF LAW. THE ARTICLE PROCEEDS AS FOLLOWS: THE FIRST SECTION LOCATES HOBBES THEORY OF LAW IN RELATION TO HIS THEORY OF AUTHORITY, DRAWING ON DAVID DYZENHAUS'S EMPHASIS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN HOBBES. THE SECOND SECTION DRAWS ON THEORISTS SUCH AS LARRY MAY TO FIND A DEFENSE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONS, WHAT I CALL INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE THIRD SECTION TURNS TO RICHARD FLATHMAN'S INTERPRETATION OF HOBBES AS A THEORIST OF LIBERAL SELF- MAKING, SUGGESTING HOW HIS INSIGHTS CAN BE APPLIED GLOBALLY. THE CONCLUSION BRINGS THESE THOUGHTS TO BEAR ON THE RELEVANCE OF HOBBES FOR GLOBAL LAW AND POLITICS.
498	PAUL ROSENSTEIN-RODAN ARGUES THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES COORDINATED INVESTMENT IN MANY INTERDEPENDENT INDUSTRIES, AND PRESCRIBES A FLOOD OF STATE-CONTROLLED INVESTMENT ACROSS ALL SECTORS-A SO-CALLED BIG PUSH. WIDESPREAD GOVERNMENT FAILURE DEFEATED TWENTIETH-CENTURY 'BIG PUSH' SCHEMES. BUT SPILLOVERS ACROSS FIRMS AND INDUSTRIES, AND FROM PUBLIC GOODS, HOLD-UP PROBLEMS, AND CAPITAL MARKET LIMITATIONS ARE REAL, AND JUSTIFY COORDINATED GROWTH ACROSS SECTORS IF IT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT FAILURES. LARGE, EXTENSIVELY DIVERSIFIED PYRAMIDAL BUSINESS GROUPS OF LISTED FIRMS DOMINATE THE HISTORIES OF DEVELOPED ECONOMIES AND THE ECONOMIES OF DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. ARGUING THAT SUCH GROUPS PROVIDED THIS COORDINATION IN PREWAR JAPAN AFTER A STATE-RUN BIG PUSH FAILED, WE PROPOSE THAT PYRAMIDAL BUSINESS GROUPS ARE PRIVATE-SECTOR MECHANISMS FOR COORDINATING BIG PUSH GROWTH, AND THAT COMPETITION BETWEEN RIVAL GROUPS INDUCES EFFICIENCY UNATTAINABLE IN A STATE-RUN BIG PUSH. WE POSTULATE THAT A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS-GROUP LED BIG PUSH REQUIRES ECONOMIC OPENNESS, BASIC PUBLIC GOODS, RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF THE STATE FROM BUSINESS, AND A TIMELY DEMISE OF BUSINESS GROUPS WHEN THE BIG PUSH PHASE IS COMPLETE. WHERE THESE CRITERIA ARE NOT MET, GROWTH STALLS AND OLIGARCHIC FAMILIES BECOME TOO POWERFUL TO DISLODGE.
499	THE ISSUE OF COMBATING CRIME HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR EVERY RULE-OF-LAW STATE. THE LOW LEVEL OF CRIME IS A SYMBIOSIS OF EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM OF BALANCED MEASURES. HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES MUST NECESSARILY CONSIDER THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE THEORETICAL PERCEPTION AND AWARENESS OF CRIME AS A PHENOMENON AND FEATURES OF THE FORMATION OF THE CRIMINAL'S PERSONALITY. THE TOPIC OF THE ARTICLE IS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ESSENCE AND COMPONENTS OF THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY THEORY OF THE NATURE OF CRIME. THE OBJECT OF RESEARCH IS THE SYMBIOTIC THEORY OF CRIME. THE AUTHORS USED THE FOLLOWING METHODS: DATA INTEGRATION AND META-ANALYSIS, BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENTS, COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH, LITERATURE REVIEW, CONCEPTUAL MAPPING AND OTHERS. THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE MAIN RESEARCH AREAS INTO THE NATURE OF THE CRIME, NEUROCRIMINOLOGY AND BEHAVIOURAL EPIGENETICS AS CONCEPTUALLY NEW SUBFIELDS OF CRIMINOLOGY, BIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES OF THE NATURE OF THE CRIME. A QUALITATIVELY NEW SYMBIOTIC THEORY OF CRIME IS PROPOSED, COMBINING A THREE-ELEMENT STRUCTURE: AN AUTONOMOUS CONNECTION OF BIOLOGICAL (ANTHROPOGENIC) FACTORS AND SOCIOLOGICAL ONES; THE FINAL CONNECTING ELEMENT OF SUCH A SYMBIOSIS IS THE HUMAN PSYCHE.
500	IN CIUDAD JUAREZ, MEXICO, TEACHERS OF A VISUAL ARTS PROGRAM WORK IN A CONTEXT CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST VIOLENT PERIOD IN MODEM HISTORY IN THE COUNTRY. BETWEEN 2008 AND 2012, WITH THE PRESENCE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS AND MILITARY CONTINGENTS THIS PERIOD WAS DISTINGUISHED BY SUCH DEEP AND IRREVERSIBLE VIOLENCE. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH IN WHICH QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES WERE USED WITH A BIOGRAPHICAL-NARRATIVE APPROACH, CARRIED OUT WITH VISUAL ARTS PROFESSORS FROM THE UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE CIUDAD JUAREZ. WE ANALYZE HOW THE PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL PATHS OF THE TEACHERS HAVE SHAPED THEIR PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES, FOR THE STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE THE AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEMS DERIVED FROM THE BORDER SOCIAL CONTEXT. THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO EXPLORE THEIR IDENTITIES AND STRENGTHEN THE EXPERIENCES LIVED IN THEIR DAILY LIFE SHAPED BY VARIOUS TYPES OF VIOLENCE THAT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND RESTRICT THE HORIZON OF WELFARE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. AS A RESULT, WE FOUND THAT THESE TEACHERS' PRACTICES REPRESENT A WAY TOWARDS THE CULTIVATION OF EXPERIENCES BY THE ART STUDENTS, THAT ALLOW THEM TO QUESTION THIS PROBLEMATIC SITUATION THROUGH COLLABORATIVE PRODUCTION METHODOLOGIES ROOTED IN CRITICAL PEDAGOGIES.
501	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF THE PROCRASTINATION OF BIOETHICS IN PRISON TREATMENT. TO THIS END, IT ANALYSES THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT AND IDENTIFIES SOME REASONS THAT LIMIT THE SCOPE OF PRINCIPLED BIOETHICS IN THE FACE OF THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN PRISON. THE METHODOLOGY IS FRAMED IN A DOCUMENTARY DESIGN, WITH A DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH, OF A QUALITATIVE TYPE, THAT FACILITATES GREATER DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN THE PRISON PHENOMENOLOGY. BASED ON THE HERMENEUTICAL PARADIGM THAT GUIDES THIS RESEARCH, RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FACE OF A MANIFEST SCENARIO OF FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF THE HUMAN DIGNITY OF PEOPLE DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY, A SITUATION THAT HAS SET OFF ALARM BELLS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, BOTH IN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND, INCIDENTALLY, HAS OPENED SPACES FOR STRONG CRITICISM OF THE BIO-POLITICAL MODEL THAT SUPPORTS THE IUS PUNIENDI. IT IS CURRENTLY DISCUSSED WHETHER THE IMPOSITION OF A CRIMINAL SANCTION REHABILITATES THE OFFENDER OR, ON THE CONTRARY, ENHANCES HIS CRIMINAL CAPACITY. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE BIOETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF NON-MALEFICENCE AND JUSTICE CAN CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES OF PUNISHMENT.
502	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYSE WHETHER BETTER GOVERNANCE REWARDS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND FACILITATES THE INTEGRATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) REGION INTO THE WORLD ECONOMY. IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER REGIONS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, MENA COUNTRIES SUFFER FROM IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES, WHICH GENERATE INSECURITY AND DIFFICULT INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. DESPITE THIS FACT, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADE AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN MENA COUNTRIES REMAINS UNEXPLORED. A GRAVITY MODEL OF TRADE AUGMENTED WITH GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IS ESTIMATED FOR THE EXPORTS OF 19 MENA COUNTRIES, THEIR 189 TRADING PARTNERS AND FOR ALL EXPORTERS IN THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2013. THE MAIN RESULTS INDICATE THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN FIVE OF THE SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS INCREASE EXPORTS FROM MENA COUNTRIES, WHEREAS BETTER GOVERNANCE IN DESTINATION COUNTRIES DOES NOT AFFECT MENA EXPORTS. INSTEAD, EACH OF THE SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS USED HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BILATERAL TRADE FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE OF EXPORTERS (189). MOREOVER, THE EFFECT OF COUNTRY-PAIR SIMILARITY IN GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUGGESTS THAT A SIMILAR LEVEL OF REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW IN EXPORTING AND IMPORTING COUNTRIES INCREASES EXPORTS FROM MENA COUNTRIES. SIMILARITIES IN VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO FOSTER EXPORTS FOR THE AVERAGE EXPORTER, BUT NOT FOR MENA EXPORTERS.
503	THE YOUNG TURK REVOLUTION OF 1908 HELPED TRANSFORM THE TIME-HONORED OTTOMAN PETITIONING SYSTEM. THE REINSTATEMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY LIFE, THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE SUSPENDED CONSTITUTION OF 1876, AND THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON THE PRESS AND POLITICAL ACTION ALL GENERATED PROFOUND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES. SUBJECTS' PETITIONS REFLECTED THESE CHANGES VIVIDLY AND IN OFTEN SURPRISING DETAIL. AS THE SULTAN BECAME A FIGUREHEAD WITH LITTLE ACTUAL POWER, PETITIONS WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED TO THE SULTAN EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE GRAND VIZIER AND HAD REQUESTED HIS BENEVOLENCE AND MERCY, WHILE ALSO GRANTING HIM MUCH NEEDED LEGITIMACY, NOW BEGAN TO BE SENT INSTEAD TO THE COUNCIL OF STATE (SURA-Y DEVLET), THE PARLIAMENT, AND VARIOUS GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES. THEIR CONTENT CHANGED AS WELL, AS WILL BE SHOWN IN THIS ARTICLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF DOZENS OF PETITIONS FROM OTTOMAN PALESTINE. PETITIONS NOW SOUGHT TO OBTAIN POLITICAL RIGHTS AND ENSURE CIVIL EQUITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. IN FOCUSING ON RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE FORMER SYSTEM, THE PETITIONS ECHOED CHANGES IN POPULAR DISCOURSE AND MIRRORED THE TRANSFORMATION FROM JUSTICE AS A SULTANIC PREROGATIVE TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW.
504	NOWADAYS, GOVERNMENTS ARE FACING SEVERAL SECURITY ISSUES ENDANGERING DIRECTLY SECURITY OF STATE AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS; ONE OF THEM IS TERRORISM. ACCORDINGLY, TERRORISM ENDANGERS NOT ONLY NATIONAL SECURITY BUT ALSO A PARADIGM OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALITY BY PUSHING GOVERNMENTS TO MEET THE TERRORIST THREAT ON ITS OWN PLAYGROUND. ENSURING SECURITY AND ABILITY TO DEFEND STATE AND CITIZENS IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND IT IS ALSO PRESUPPOSITION OF EVERY STATE'S SOVEREIGNTY. ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS SERVING TO ENSURE AND PRESERVE SECURITY OF STATE AND INDIVIDUALS ARE EMERGENCIES. WHEN FACING TERRORIST THREAT, GOVERNMENTS USUALLY STAND BEFORE A DIFFICULT QUESTION: SHOULD CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS BE IGNORED, SUSPEND OR EVEN REMOVED IN TIME OF TERRORIST THREAT? SHOULD WE ACTIVATE 'EMERGENCY POWERS' WHICH ENABLE GOVERNMENTS TO OVERCOME CRISIS AND RESTORE STATE OF NORMALCY? MORE RECENTLY, ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION CLOSELY LINKED WITH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERRORISM AND EMERGENCY FOLLOWS THE SURFACE: SHOULD GOVERNMENTS ADOPT SPECIAL STATE OF EMERGENCY LAW TO COMBAT TERRORISM OR CAN THEY OPERATE SUFFICIENTLY WITH EXISTING REGIMES OF EMERGENCY? THIS DILEMMA WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF CZECH LEGAL ORDER.
505	WE EVALUATE THAT ONE OF THE AIMS OF THE STATE IN ANY CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY WHERE RULE OF LAW FORMS THE BASE IS TO APPLY THE LAW IN JUSTICE AND DISPENSE IT. BRANCH OF TAX LAW HAS ITS OWN AIMS DERIVED FROM THIS RULE. NONETHELESS WE SEE SUCH CASES (I.E. ACTUAL STATES) IN TAX LAW THAT HELPS THE UNRECORDED ECONOMY TO GROW THAT SOURCE FROM DEFICIENCIES WITH REGARD TO CONTROL, OR FROM PENALTIES NOT BEING DETERRENT. IN OTHER WORDS THESE ACTUAL STATES MAKE WAY FOR NOT PROVISIONS BUT REASONS TO DISAPPEAR PRODUCING SOME MASKED TYPES OF SITUATION. ONE OF THE SOLID CASES FOR THESE ACTUAL STATES IS TO FAIL TO NOTICE A STATEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT. THIS ACTUAL STATE PRODUCES NEGATIVE RESULTS NOT ONLY FOR PUBLIC BUT ALSO FOR THE OBLIGED FOR FACING PENALTIES THAT ARE NOT DETERRENT, OR PRODUCING AN UNFAIR COMPETITION ENVIRONMENT FOR THEMSELVES. THUS WE EVALUATE THAT THERE ARE SOME STEPS TO TAKE FOR PREVENTING THESE TO HAPPEN AIMING TO ELIMINATE THE UNFAVORABLE RESULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIM TO PRESENT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF A FAILURE TO MAKE A NOTICE OF STATEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT OVER UNRECORDED ECONOMY, AND PROPOSALS TO AVOID.
506	DRAWING ON ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT RECORDS OBTAINED USING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE SECURITIZATION OF CANADA'S AID PROGRAM TO HAITI BETWEEN 2004 AND 2009. THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES HOW CANADIAN AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP), CORRECTIONAL SERVICE OF CANADA (CSC), AND THE CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, WERE INVOLVED IN CAPACITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES THAT FOCUSED ON POLICE REFORM, BORDER SURVEILLANCE, AND PRISON CONSTRUCTION/REFURBISHMENT ACROSS HAITI IN THE AFTERMATH OF A COUP THAT OUSTED THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT JEAN-BERTRAND ARISTIDE. THE AUTHOR DEMONSTRATES HOW THESE EFFORTS AT SECURITIZATION RESULTED IN WHAT OFFICIALS REFERRED TO AS THE "HAITIAN PARADOX," WHEREBY REORGANIZATION OF THE HAITIAN NATIONAL POLICE FORCE LED TO HIGHER ARREST RATES AND JAIL BLOAT, CREATING CONDITIONS THAT VIOLATED RATHER THAN AMELIORATED HUMAN RIGHTS. WHILE THE SECURITIZATION PROJECT MAY HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CANADIAN POLICY MAKERS' OFFICIAL DISCOURSE, IN PRACTICE THESE SECURITIZATION EFFORTS EXACERBATED JAIL OVERCROWDING, DISTRUST OF POLICE, AND PERSECUTION OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THE AUTHOR THEREFORE DEMONSTRATES ONE WAY THAT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AID, AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE INTERSECT, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE TRANSNATIONAL ASPECTS OF RCMP AND CSC ACTIVITIES.
507	THE VIABILITY OF THE THESIS THAT LIBERALIZATION AND DEMOCRACY FOSTER PEACE, SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT IS AT STAKE. THE MAIN CRITIQUE IS THAT MORE LIBERTIES AND ELECTIONS LEAD TO MORE CONFLICT AND ABUSES OF POWER. THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPAL RESPONSES TO THIS CRITIQUE. THE LIBERAL ARGUMENT CALLS FOR IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS; THE INSTITUTIONS FIRST THESIS PRIORITIZES STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND STATE CAPACITY OVER DEMOCRACY; WHILST THE TRANSFORMATION ARGUMENT PROPOSES USING FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY TO FOSTER GRADUALLY MORE FAVOURABLE RELATIONS OF POWER AND POPULAR CAPACITY TOWARDS MORE SUBSTANTIAL DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE RELEVANCE OF THESE THESES TO THE REMARKABLE DYNAMICS OF PEACE-BUILDING IN ACEH, FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF INDONESIAN DEMOCRACY IN 1998, THE IMPACT OF THE TSUNAMI IN 2004 AND THE HELSINKI PEACE AGREEMENT IN 2005 TO THE GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 2009. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE LIBERAL ARGUMENT IS CONGRUOUS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEACE, WHILE THE INSTITUTIONS FIRST AND THE TRANSFORMATION ARGUMENTS GIVE PROMINENCE TO THE DYNAMICS THAT MADE PEACE-BUILDING POSSIBLE BUT ALSO DIFFICULT. WHILE THE INSTITUTIONS FIRST ARGUMENT RESPONDS TO THESE DIFFICULTIES BY RESORTING TO POWER SHARING, THE TRANSFORMATION THESIS PROPOSES MORE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION COUPLED WITH INTEREST AND ISSUE GROUP REPRESENTATION.
508	DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY IN THE CARBON FUEL ERA HAS BEEN BASED ON POPULAR ACCEPTANCE OF ELITIST DEMOCRACY IN RETURN FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RISING MATERIAL STANDARDS OF LIVING. THIS SOCIAL CONTRACT OF CONSUMPTION IS COMING TO AN END WITH CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND ECOLOGICAL LIMITS TO GROWTH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A NEW ERA CHARACTERIZED BY A SOCIAL COVENANT OF ECOLOGICAL TRUSTEESHIP IS NECESSARY. WILL THE POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE OF THIS NEW COVENANT NECESSARILY BE ELITIST AND AUTHORITARIAN, OR CAN IT BE DEMOCRATIC IN NEW WAYS? THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE NATURE AND PROSPECTS FOR A FUTURE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE THAT REMAINS LIBERAL IN ITS RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IS MORE DELIBERATIVE AND CIVIC IN ITS ORIENTATION THAN INTEREST GROUP LIBERALISM HAS BEEN. KEY CONCEPTS OF ECOLOGICAL LITERACY AND ECOLOGICAL DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP ARE DISCUSSED. LITERACY IS UNDERSTOOD AS A FUNCTION OF BOTH INFORMATION AND EMPOWERMENT. A MODEL OF CITIZENSHIP AS TRUSTEESHIP IS DEFENDED AGAINST THE NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP AS RATIONAL-CHOICE CONSUMERISM. DELIBERATION AS DISTINCT FROM BARGAINING, AND DIALOGIC JUDGMENT RATHER THAN MONOLOGIC ASSESSMENT OF INTERESTS, ARE DEFENDED AS THE APPROPRIATE FORMS OF POLICY MAKING AND POLICY ANALYSIS.
509	NEOLIBERAL MARKET REFORMERS STRESS THE 'MARKET BUILDING INSTINCTS' OF PRIVATE OWNERS TO JUSTIFY RAPID FORMS OF PROPERTY TRANSFORMATION UNDER ILLIBERAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS. PRIVATE OWNERS DEMAND THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE SELF-RESTRAINING STATE TO PROTECT PROPERTY FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF EXPROPRIATION AND TO ENFORCE CONTRACTS. LEGACY THEORISTS COUNTER THAT UNDER ILLIBERAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS, ECONOMIC INSIDERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CAPTURE THE BENEFITS OF PRIVATIZATION PROGRAMS AND THEN SEEK EXEMPTION FROM THE RULE OF LAW RATHER THAN APPLICATION OF IT. WE EMPLOY A 'PATH CONTINGENCY' APPROACH TO SHOW THAT UNDER ILLIBERAL, COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIAN CONDITIONS, PRIVATIZATION RECIPIENTS AND OTHER PRIVATE ECONOMIC AGENTS ARE UNLIKELY TO DEMAND THE BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF MARKET DEMOCRACY. YET, THIS IS BY NO MEANS A STABLE SET OF AFFAIRS. POLITICAL INEQUALITY AND ITS ATTENDANT RENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOR WILL LIKELY DELAY OR DISTORT GROWTH AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. POLITICAL CRISIS MAY FOLLOW AS REGIMES FACE SOCIETAL FRUSTRATION AND ENERGIZED, UNITED POLITICAL OPPOSITIONS. SUCH CRISES ARE MOMENTS OF UNCERTAINTY AND FLUX. CRISES PROVIDE PRIVATE ECONOMIC AGENTS IN PARTICULAR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER THEIR TIES TO AN ILLIBERAL REGIME. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THESE PROPOSITIONS DURING ILLIBERAL REGIME CRISES IN SERBIA, GEORGIA AND AZERBAIJAN.
510	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE SEMIOTIC DIMENSION OF PATENT INTERPRETATION. PATENT DOCUMENTS ARE AT THE SAME TIME DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION (BY THE INVENTORS TO SOCIETY) AND A GRANTING OF RIGHTS (BY SOCIETY TO THE INVENTORS). THE CLAIM SECTION EXPRESSES THE GRANTED RIGHTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE VIEW THE CLAIMS AS SIGNS THAT EXPRESS THE GRANTED RIGHTS (MENTAL CONCEPT). THE SEMANTICS TO INTERPRET THE SIGNS IS GIVEN BY THE ALL-ELEMENTS RULE, AS PRAGMATICS. THE DESCRIPTION AND DRAWINGS SECTIONS OF THE PATENT DOCUMENT PROVIDE METAPRAGMATICS IN THE FORM OF LEXICON AND SYNTAX TO HELP THE UNDERSTANDING THE CLAIMS AS SIGNS THAT EXPRESS THE GRANTED RIGHTS. THIS SEMIOTIC APPROACH FOR PATENT INTERPRETATION HAS IMPORTANT PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES TO THE CORRECT STRUCTURING OF A PATENT DOCUMENT. WE HIGHLIGHT THIS CONTRIBUTION THROUGH AN INSTANCE OF A PATENT APPLICATION IN WHICH A CLAIM INCLUDES EXAMPLES OF USE. EXAMPLES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN THE CLAIM TEXT, AS EXAMPLES DO NOT DESCRIBE THE INVENTION, BUT CONSIST OF METAPRAGMATICS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INVENTION. IN THIS WAY, EXAMPLES CONSIST OF METAPRAGMATICS AND BELONG TO THE DESCRIPTION SECTION OF THE PATENT, WHICH HAS THE GOAL TO FACILITATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF CLAIMS (BY PROVIDING THE NECESSARY METAPRAGMATICS IN THE FORM OF LEXICON AND SYNTAX). IN THE PATENT APPLICATION USED TO HIGHLIGHT OUR SEMIOTICS APPROACH FOR PATENT INTERPRETATION, THE EXAMPLES INITIALLY PRESENTED IN THE CLAIMS WERE REPHRASED IN THE FINAL GRANTED PATENT, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE SCOPE OF THE CLAIM.
511	THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO MAKE A THEOLOGICAL CASE FOR UKRAINE'S INTEGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN FAMILY OF NATIONS. I BUILD THIS CASE BY PURSUING TWO PRIMARY LINES OF ARGUMENT: FIRSTLY, BY DEMONSTRATING THE IMPLAUSIBILITY OF THE COMMON ASSUMPTIONS (HELD BY MANY UKRAINIAN CHRISTIANS) THAT RUSSIA IS MORE 'SPIRITUAL' AND 'CHRISTIAN' THAN 'SECULAR' AND 'GODLESS' EUROPE. SECONDLY, I SEEK TO MAKE A POSITIVE CASE FOR WHY PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS HUMAN DIGNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, EQUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE INDICATORS OF CHRISTIAN VALUES THAN NOMINAL ALLEGIANCE TO RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AMONG A CERTAIN POPULATION. THIS ARTICLE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS. PART ONE IDENTIFIES AND CRITIQUES THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THE "HOLY RUSSIA" MYTH WITH ILLUSTRATIONS DRAWN FROM VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVE FIGURES. PART TWO IS DEVOTED TO THE DEFENCE OF THE EUROPEAN TRADITION IN WHICH I ADVANCE THE COUNTERINTUITIVE ARGUMENT THAT SECULAR LIBERALISM IS MORE IN CONTINUITY WITH ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY THAN CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM. IN PART THREE, I APPLY THESE GENERAL POINTS TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF UKRAINE AND ITS FATE AS A EUROPEAN NATION.
512	WE STUDY THE EVOLUTION OF THE AFRICAN MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY FROM ITS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING AND EXPLORE THE SOURCES OF OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES AMONG INDIGENOUS FIRMS, BY ASSEMBLING HISTORICAL QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FIRM-LEVEL DATA. OUR HISTORICAL QUALITATIVE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A FEW START-UPS GAINED INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THEIR PRE-ENTRY EXPERIENCE, DIRECTED THEIR POSTENTRY DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES TOWARD ADAPTATIONS TO CHALLENGING MARKET AND OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS, AND LEVERAGED THEIR ADAPTIVE CAPABILITIES TO ENTER AND COMPETE IN OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES. USING OUR QUANTITATIVE PANEL DATA, WE SHOW THAT THESE FIRMS SUCCESSFULLY INTERNATIONALIZED ACROSS THE CONTINENT. IN PARTICULAR, COMPARED WITH OTHER START-UPS, THEY HAD HIGHER RATES OF FOREIGN ENTRY IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAD RELATIVELY WEAKER RULE OF LAW, AND GREATER MARKET REACH IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAD RELATIVELY LARGER LOW-INCOME CONSUMER SEGMENTS. THESE PATTERNS CORROBORATE THAT THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR OVERCOMING THE INDUSTRY'S CHALLENGING MARKET AND OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS WERE THEIR KEY OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES. THROUGH OUR TRIANGULATED ANALYSIS, WE SHOW THAT INHERITED INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR POSTENTRY CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADERSHIP GUIDES THIS PROCESS TO CREATE OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES FOR REGIONAL INTERNATIONALIZATION.
513	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE COUNTRY-LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONIZATION AND DEGREES OF LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONIZATION DURING ECONOMIC GROWTH VOLATILITY. AS A NON-DIVERSIFIABLE RISK FACTOR, LIQUIDITY CO-MOVEMENT SHOCK SPREADS MARKET-WIDE AND THUS DISRUPTS THE OVERALL FUNCTIONING OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET. FIRMS IN ASIAN MARKETS OPERATE IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS DISTINCT FROM THOSE OF FIRMS ANALYZED IN THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE. COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES OF LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONICITY IN EMERGING MARKETS ARE LIMITED. A MAJOR KNOWLEDGE GAP PERTAINING TO ASIAN EMERGING MARKETS SERVES AS THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY. SEVEN ASIAN EMERGING ECONOMIES ARE SELECTED FROM THE MSCI EMERGING MARKET INDEX: BANGLADESH, CHINA, INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, PAKISTAN AND THE PHILIPPINES FOR ANALYSIS FROM 2010 TO 2019. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW HIGH LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONICITY IN WEAKER ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENTS WITH LOW GDP GROWTH, HIGH INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES AND UNDERDEVELOPED FINANCIAL SYSTEMS TAKING THE FORM OF LOW LEVELS OF PRIVATE CREDIT. LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONICITY IS ALSO AFFECTED BY POOR INVESTOR PROTECTION, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, WEAK RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT INEFFECTIVENESS. MOREOVER, LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY SYNCHRONICITY ARE HIGHER IN A PERIOD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH VOLATILITY.
514	THE PAPER ANALYSES THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEVEL ON BILATERAL FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) FLOWS. THE THEORY SUGGESTS THAT MORE DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS IN BOTH HOME AND HOST COUNTRIES SHOULD INCREASE FDI FLOWS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME EXISTING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH OFTEN HAVE CONTROVERSIAL RESULTS. WE USE THE DATABASE ON BILATERAL FDI FLOWS FOR 67 RECIPIENT COUNTRIES AND 109 HOME COUNTRIES FOR THE YEARS OF 2001-2016, COVERING ABOUT 80% OF FDI FLOWS OF THE PERIOD. THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE CONSIDERED: VOTING RIGHT, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, REGULATION QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL. USING THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS, WE CONSTRUCT AN AGGREGATE INDEX OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EACH COUNTRY IN THE RESPECTIVE YEAR. IN CONTRAST TO MANY RELATED RESEARCH WE CONSIDER THE ENDOGENEITY PROBLEM TO GET THE UNBIASED ESTIMATES. USING POISSON PSEUDO MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD METHOD WITH INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES (IV PPML) AND IN OPPOSITION TO MANY EMPIRICAL RESEARCHERS WE DO NOT FIND SUPPORT TO THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF COUNTRIES' INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON FDI FLOWS. WE DO NOT FIND PROOF FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INCREASES IN INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE BETWEEN COUNTRIES LEAD TO BILATERAL FDI SHRINKING.
515	BETWEEN 1974 AND 2005, A MAJORITY OF STATES BECAME DEMOCRATIC FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. HOWEVER, A GLOBAL DEMOCRATIC RECESSION BEGAN IN 2006 AND HAS PERSISTED - AND DEEPENED - OVER THE PAST 14 YEARS. NOT ONLY HAVE AVERAGE LEVELS OF FREEDOM (OR DEMOCRATIC QUALITY) BEEN DECLINING GLOBALLY AND IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD, BUT THE PACE OF DEMOCRATIC BREAKDOWN ACCELERATED AND THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS DECLINED, PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. DEMOCRATIC REGRESSION IS PARTICULARLY VISIBLE AMONG THE G-20 COUNTRIES AND OTHER MOST POPULOUS AND GEOPOLITICALLY WEIGHTY COUNTRIES, 19 OF WHICH HAVE DECLINED IN FREEDOM DURING THE DEMOCRATIC RECESSION, WITH ONLY TWO IMPROVING. THE PRINCIPAL METHOD OF DEMOCRATIC REGRESSION HAS BEEN INCREMENTAL STRANGULATION OF DEMOCRACY BY ELECTED (TYPICALLY POPULIST) EXECUTIVES WHO GRADUALLY EVISCERATE INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS, POLITICAL OPPOSITION, INDEPENDENT MEDIA, AND OTHER FORCES OF SCRUTINY AND RESISTANCE IN CIVIL SOCIETY. WEAK AND DECLINING RULE OF LAW HAS PREDISPOSED REGIMES TO DEMOCRATIC REGRESSION, ENABLING AMBITIOUS RULERS TO HOLLOW OUT POLITICAL COMPETITION. BUT INTERNATIONAL FACTORS HAVE ALSO BEEN CRUCIAL, GENERATING COMMON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRESSES WHILE LIFTING THE CONSTRAINTS AND LOWERING THE RISKS AUTOCRATS FACE AS THEY INAUGURATE OR ACCELERATE THE SLIDE INTO AUTHORITARIANISM.
516	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF DEMOCRACY UNDERLYING THE JUDGMENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF EUROPE. I READ THE JUDGEMENT, CRITICALLY, AS IMPEDIMENT AND, CONSTRUCTIVELY, AS IMPETUS FOR THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF MONEY AND SOCIETY. FIRSTLY, I RECOUNT HOW THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (FCC) THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A "RIGHT TO DEMOCRACY" AND THE CONCEPTS OF "ULTRA VIRES ACT" AND "INTEGRATION RESPONSIBILITY" ASSERTED ITS JURISDICTION OVER THE LIMITS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. THE COURT'S REASONING PROMPTS ME TO UNDERSTAND THE JUDGMENT NOT AS A DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, BUT RATHER AS AN INSTANCE OF UPHOLDING A "RULE OF LAW" THAT IMPEDES THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF SOCIETY. SECONDLY, I TURN TO THE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE DEMARCATION OF MONETARY FROM ECONOMIC COMPETENCES BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) AND THE FCC. I EXPLAIN WHAT I HOLD TO BE THE WEAKNESSES IN THE FCC'S CRITIQUE OF THE CJEU FROM A DOCTRINAL PERSPECTIVE. I THEN PROPOSE TO READ THE PSPP JUDGMENT CONSTRUCTIVELY AS INTRODUCING A PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT THAT MAY DEMOCRATIZE MONETARY POLICY. THIRDLY, I SITUATE MY READING OF THE JUDGMENT IN THE LARGER DEBATE ON THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF SOCIETY AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, MONEY.
517	THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS THAT GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND PERSONAL SECURITY IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY WAS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL ACTS, THE DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE CURRENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE ON THE ISSUES OF GUARANTEEING AND SECURING OF THAT RIGHT. THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE USED THE FOLLOWING METHODS: DIALECTICS, COMPARATIVE LEGAL, SYSTEM ANALYSIS, FORMAL LOGIC. THE RELEVANCE OF THE TOPIC OF THIS ARTICLE DEPENDS ON THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT DIRECTION OF THE REFORM OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION IS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE LEGAL GUARANTEES FOR THE PROTECTION OF A PERSON, PROTECTION OF HIS RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF EVERY HUMAN BEING AS THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND PERSONAL SECURITY IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE LEGAL MECHANISMS FOR THE APPLICATION OF COERCIVE MEASURES NEED TO BE REVIEWED, REEVALUATED AND ADJUSTED. THIS, OF COURSE, REFLECTS THE APPROXIMATION OF NATIONAL LAW TO INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS, EUROPEAN VALUES, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND SO ON.
518	THE AIMS OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE (SI) ARE TO PROVIDE A BROAD AND STRUCTURED OVERVIEW ON LITERATURE PUBLISHED RELATED TO LAW AND ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS (EE) AS WELL AS TO OFFER LATEST INSIGHTS INTO THIS WIDE AND FURTHER EMERGING COMBINED FIELD OF RESEARCH BY MEANS OF CONTRIBUTED PAPERS. THUS, THIS INTRODUCTION INTO THE SI FIRSTLY IMPLEMENTS A SYSTEMATIC DATABASE TERM SEARCH AND FURTHER ANALYSES 129 PAPERS IDENTIFIED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY REFERS TO THE "LAWS" OF THERMODYNAMICS. ONLY 33 PUBLICATIONS COULD BE RELATED TO EE AND LAW, LATTER IN THE SENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WITH QUITE EVEN ALLOCATION AMONG THE THREE STREAMS IDENTIFIED, NAMELY THEORETICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, STRATEGIC TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION STUDIES, AND PRACTICAL CASE STUDIES. THE LITERATURE OVERVIEW ALSO CHRONOLOGICALLY INDICATES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE 33 PAPERS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DURING THE PAST 15 YEARS. THE SECOND PART OF THIS INTRODUCTION DESCRIBES THE CONTENT OF THE SEVEN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SI MORE IN DETAIL. AFTERWARDS IT SHOWS THAT THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TEND SIMILARLY MORE INTO THE DIRECTIONS OF PROVIDING STRATEGIC TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION STUDIES AS WELL AS PRACTICAL CASE STUDIES, INDICATING AN OVERALL SHIFT FROM THEORY TOWARDS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EE WITHIN LAW.
519	OVER THE LAST DECADE(S), THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS GEOPOLITICAL ACTOR SEEKING TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN THE SPATIAL ORDERING OF ITS NEIGHBOURHOODS. IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING GEOPOLITICAL NATURE OF THE EU, THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF THE EU?S DECADE-LONG ENDEAVOUR TO CONSTRUCT LEGITIMACY IN ITS NORTHERN NEIGHBOURHOOD; AN AREA OFTEN NEGLECTED IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE EU?S GEOPOLITICAL ROLE. BY EXAMINING ITS ARCTIC INVOLVEMENT BETWEEN 2008 AND 2018, THIS ARTICLE ENQUIRES INTO THE EU?S BROADER ROLE AS AN INTERNATIONAL ACTOR WITH AN EVOLVING GEOPOLITICAL IDENTITY. OVER THE LAST DECADES, THE EU HAS EXHIBITED GEOPOLITICAL AMBITIONS ALONGSIDE ITS OWN CONCEPTUALISATION OF WORLD ORDER, RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE ESTABLISHES A CLEARER PICTURE ON HOW THE EU AS AN AMALGAMATION OF ITS VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS HAS TRIED TO IMPOSE THESE GEOPOLITICAL AMBITIONS ON A NEIGHBOURING REGION THAT ITSELF EXPERIENCES A MANIFOLD CHANGE IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH-FIRST CENTURY. IT GETS TO THE CONCEPTUAL BOTTOM OF WHAT EXACTLY FASHIONED THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH GEOPOLITICAL AGENCY IN THE ARCTIC REGION ? INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON A DECADE OF RESEARCH ON THE EU AS AN EMERGING ARCTIC ACTOR.
520	THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF POPULISM THAT HAS EVOLVED IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, MOST NOTABLY IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. THE NEW POPULISM IN ECE DIFFERS FROM OTHER POPULISMS BECAUSE IT COMBINES THE ELEMENTS OF POPULISM, ETHNONATIONALISM, AND AUTHORITARIANISM. ADHERING TO A SIMILAR SCRIPT, WHICH CONSISTS OF SUSTAINED ATTACKS ON RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS, CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, THE MEDIA, AND ELECTORAL RULES, BOTH POPULIST GOVERNMENTS IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME DISMANTLED ALMOST ALL THE KEY CORNERSTONES OF DEMOCRACY IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. THE CURRENT SURGE OF POPULISM IN ECE DEMONSTRATES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IS IN GREAT DANGER WHEN ITS CORE PRINCIPLES NO LONGER ENJOY WIDE DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. PARADOXICALLY, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY CAN PLAY ITS "COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN" ROLE ONLY WHEN A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. ULTIMATELY, DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PARTIES AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS WITH CREDIBLE POLITICAL IDEAS AND PROGRAMS OFFER THE BEST HOPE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THE ROLE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES IS LESS OF AN ESSENTIAL BULWARK AGAINST DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING THAN IS TRADITIONALLY PRESUMED IN THE LEGAL LITERATURE.
521	THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A CRITICAL READING OF CONTEMPORARY POPULISMS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF RALF DAHRENDORF 'S THOUGHT. NEOLIBERAL GLOBALIZATION HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED - FOR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF CITIZENSHIP - BY A REDUCTION IN LIFE CHANCES, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS INCREASINGLY TENDED TO PLACE THE EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT DETRIMENT OF POLITICAL FREEDOM AND SOCIAL EQUITY. ON THE POLITICAL SIDE WE HAVE WITNESSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL KIND OF TECHNOCRATIC AND SCARCELY DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. WE EXPLORE HOW THE DE-LEGITIMIZATION OF INSTITUTIONS AND TRADITIONAL POLITICAL ACTORS AND THE WORSENING OF THE LIFE CONDITION PROMOTED THE RISE OF POPULIST AND ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT MOVEMENTS. POPULISM EXPRESSES AN VIEW OF DEMOCRACY WHICH STRESS THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DENIES, OR MINIMIZES, THE EXISTENCE OF A PLURALITY OF LEGITIMATE CONFLICTING INTERESTS AND OPINIONS. ACCORDING TO DAHRENDORF LEGACY, THE RISE OF POPULISM CAN BE READ AS THE EXPRESSION OF AN AMBIGUOUS AND DANGEROUS PHASE OF TRANSFORMATION OF DEMOCRACY. IT REPRESENTS, IN ITS MAIN EXPRESSIONS, A MODEL OF POST-LIBERAL DEMOCRACY THAT CAN NEVERTHELESS FEED RISKY FORMS OF DEMOCRATIC AUTHORITARIANISM.
522	UNDERSTANDING WHICH ASPECTS OF FOREST GOVERNANCE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE DEFORESTATION IS CENTRAL TO REVERSING TRENDS IN GLOBAL DEFORESTATION. THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES EXAMINING THIS RELATIONSHIP USING VARIOUS MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE AND STUDY DESIGNS, COMING TO DIVERSE CONCLUSIONS. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF VARIATION ACROSS STUDIES, THIS ARTICLE CONDUCTS A META-ANALYSIS OF 32 EMPIRICAL CROSS-COUNTRY STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMICS, CONTAINING 227 ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE MEASURES ON DEFORESTATION. USING AN ORDERED PROBIT MODEL, WE FIND THAT THE CHOICE OF THE GOVERNANCE MEASURE IS THE MAIN FACTOR IN EXPLAINING VARIATIONS IN THE OUTCOMES OF THE STUDIES. IN PARTICULAR, STUDIES USING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY, OWNERSHIP RIGHTS, PRESENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS, AND RULE OF LAW AS MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE, ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND THAT BETTER GOVERNANCE REDUCES DEFORESTATION. IN CONTRAST, STUDIES USING DEMOCRACY AND RIGHTS AS A MEASURE OF GOVERNANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND THAT DEFORESTATION INCREASES, WHEN GOVERNANCE IS IMPROVED. THE FINDING THAT NOT ALL ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE IMPROVEMENTS ARE EQUALLY SUPPORTIVE OF FOREST CONSERVATION SUGGESTS THAT MORE NUANCED ANALYSES OF SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE ARE REQUIRED TO GUIDE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY MAKING.
523	IN AUGUST 2015, THE ASSEMBLY OF KOSOVO ESTABLISHED THE SPECIALIST CHAMBERS (SC) AND THE ASSOCIATED SPECIALIST PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE (SPO) WITH THE MANDATE OF PROSECUTING INTERNATIONAL AND TRANS-BOUNDARY CRIMES COMMITTED DURING AND AFTER THE 1998-1999 KOSOVO ARMED CONFLICT. THE OBJECTIVES IN THIS ARTICLE ASSESSING THE SC ARE TWOFOLD. FIRST, THE AIM IS TO PROVIDE A CRITICAL ACCOUNT OF THE PROCESS THAT LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SC. IT WILL BE INQUIRED WHETHER THE DECISION TO CREATE YET ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTION WAS, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JUDICIAL ECONOMY, THE MOST DEFENSIBLE ONE. ARGUMENTS COULD BE MADE FOR INSTANCE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION (EULEX) AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER-EQUIPPED INSTITUTIONS, GIVEN THEIR EXPERTISE OF THE CONFLICT AND PATTERNS OF CRIMES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE SC. SECONDLY, THE ARTICLE WILL DELVE INTO SOME ISSUES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR THE SC, NAMELY THE APPLICABLE LAW OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND THE PROVISIONS IN THE LAW ESTABLISHING THE SC UNDER WHICH TO PROSECUTE AND ADJUDICATE THE PRACTICE OF ORGAN TRAFFICKING.
524	THE PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE WAS SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED WITH THE PARIS AGREEMENT, WHICH IS A MILESTONE FOR THE WORLD IN COLLECTIVELY COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. BY PARTICIPATING IN IPCC ASSESSMENTS AND CONDUCTING NATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENTS, CHINA HAS BEEN INCREASING ITS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, CHINA'S TOP LEADER ATTENDED THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES, WHICH INDICATES THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE RATIONALITY AND NECESSITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE BY CHINA AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. MOREOVER, THIS PARTICIPATION REFLECTS CHINA'S COMMITMENT TO INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE IN ITS ECOLOGY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND PURSUING A LOW-CARBON SOCIETY AND ECONOMY. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE PARIS CONFERENCE, CHINA HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY. CHINA'S CONSTRUCTIVE PARTICIPATION IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SHOWS THAT CHINA IS A RESPONSIBLE POWER. THESE PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE CREATION OF A FUTURE OF WIN-WIN COOPERATION WITH EACH COUNTRY CONTRIBUTING TO THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY; A FUTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, FAIRNESS, AND JUSTICE; AND A FUTURE OF INCLUSIVENESS, MUTUAL LEARNING, AND COMMON DEVELOPMENT WILL SERVE AS CHINA'S GUIDELINES IN ITS EFFORTS TO FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND PARTICIPATE IN THE DESIGN OF INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS.
525	FOLLOWING INCREASED INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN POST-INTERVENTION LAW REFORM, A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN IS WHETHER LEGAL TRANSPLANTS ARE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR CREATING URGENTLY REQUIRED CRIMINAL LAW TO PROMOTE RULE OF LAW AND TRANSITIONS FROM CONFLICT TO PEACE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES AFGHANISTAN'S INTERIM CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE 2004 (ICPC), ONE THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLES OF A TRANSPLANTED CRIMINAL LAW INTRODUCED IN A POST-INTERVENTION STATE. THE ARTICLE APPLIES AN EVALUATIVE TEST TO THE ICPC USING QUANTITATIVE DATA SUPPORTED BY ORIGINAL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH CONSISTING OF INTERVIEWS WITH SENIOR AFGHAN AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PERSONNEL. IT FINDS THAT THE CODE HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THIS IS A RESULT OF THE MANY CHALLENGES FACING THE REFORM OF THE STATE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE PROCESSES OF TRANSPLANTATION AND THE TRANSPLANTED CONTENT OF THE CODE HAVE REDUCED THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND ACHIEVED ITS OBJECTIVES. THE REASONABLENESS OF RELYING ON A LEGAL TRANSPLANT AS A SOLUTION FOR CREATING NEW LAW WILL DEPEND ON THE SENSITIVITY WITH WHICH IT IS EMPLOYED. THIS REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF LEGAL TRANSPLANT FEASIBILITY, LOCAL HISTORY AND LEGAL TRADITIONS AS WELL AS REFLECTION ON THE POTENTIAL OF SUCCESSFUL RECEPTION OF THE LAW BEFORE ITS IMPLEMENTATION.
526	A CENTRAL CHALLENGE OF AMARTYA SEN'S COMPARATIVE VIEW OF JUSTICE IS TO BRING CULTURAL DIVERSITY TO BEAR ON CONCEPTUALIZING GLOBAL JUSTICE, WHICH INCLUDES BUILDING BRIDGES ACROSS CULTURES THAT ENABLE EFFECTIVE ACTION, AND RENDERING COMPATIBLE THE MOST BENEFICENT OF RAWLSIAN (OR TRANSCENDENTAL) INTENTIONS WITH IRREDUCIBLE CULTURAL DIVERSITY. FOR SOCIAL SCIENTISTS MEETING THIS CHALLENGE REQUIRES, FIRST, TAKING ACCOUNT OF VARIATION OF SOCIAL PRACTICES IN THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF MEANING, AND SECOND, UNCOVERING INVISIBLE FRONTIERS OF GLOBAL JUSTICE THAT REMAIN HIDDEN DUE TO CONCEPTUAL OR EMPIRICAL OVERSIGHT. THE LATTER IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (IR) THEORY, WHICH ASSUMES STATE ACTORS TO BE THE MAIN INTERLOCUTORS IN THE GLOBAL REALM, AND THUS PRECLUDES CONSIDERATION OF MICRO-LEVEL FORMS OF INTER-NATIONAL RELATIONS (UNDERSTOOD AS INTERACTION AMONG ALL TYPES OF ACTORS THAT TAKES PLACE ACROSS COUNTRY BORDERS AND THAT BEARS TRAITS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY). ALTERNATIVELY, SEN'S MICRO-PERSPECTIVAL APPROACH OFFERS A WELCOME SUPPORT FOR PLURALIST APPROACHES THAT BOTH APPRECIATE NON-STATE ACCESS TO CONTESTATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA, AND ACCOUNT FOR THE MEANING-IN-USE OF FUNDAMENTAL NORMS (DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS) IN DIFFERENT CULTURAL AND INTER-NATIONAL CONTEXTS.
527	IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT AS TIME PASSES, THE MORE WE PROGRESS AS BOTH A SPECIES AND AS INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS; THE MORE WE PROGRESS, THE MORE CIVILIZED WE BECOME INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY; THE MORE CIVILIZED WE BECOME, THE FURTHER WE ARE REMOVED FROM THE VESTIGES OF SAVAGERY AND BARBARISM. BUT IS THIS REALLY THE CASE? IT IS ALSO GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT CIVILIZATION IS A GOOD THING, BOTH IN TERMS OF A PROCESS AND AS A DESTINATION. THE MARKERS AND TRAPPINGS OF CIVILIZATION SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, URBANIZATION, COMPETENT GOVERNMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, THE ARTS, MATERIAL WELL-BEING, AND SO ON ARE SEEN AS DESIRABLE AND MUCH PREFERRED TO THE ABSENCE THEREOF. BUT WHAT IS THE COST OF THIS PROGRESS? AND IS CIVILIZATION SUSTAINABLE? SOME YEARS AGO IT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVILIZATION (BOTH THE PROCESS AND THE STATE OF BEING) AND THE PROLIFERATION OF INCREASINGLY LETHAL ARMED CONFLICT. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT THESE TROUBLING ISSUES IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF OUR WORLD AND WONDERS WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE TIME TO RETHINK AND REFRAME WHAT IS MEANT BY CIVILIZATION.
528	EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN THIS WORLD SEEKS TO ACHIEVE A HEALTHY, WEALTHY, SECURED AND BLISSFUL LIFE AS SUGGESTED BY MASLOW' NEED HIERARCHY. A REGRESSION ANALYSIS TAKING LIFE SATISFACTION INDEX ( AS OBTAINED FROM WORLD DATABASE OF HAPPINESS BETWEEN 1995- 2005) AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE INDICATED RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULARITY AUTHORITY AS WELL AS ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDICATORS ( AS OBTAINED FROM HERITAGE FOUNDATION DATABASE, 1995- 2006) AS VERY SIGNIFI CANT PREDICTORS. IN THIS ARTICLE, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO UNDERSTAND THIS TRI-DIMENSIONAL CONCEPT OF HAPPINESS AND COMBINING THEM TO ARRIVE AT A COMPOSITE INDEX OF HAPPINESS. EFFORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS NATIONS IN THEIR PERSISTENCY TO ACHIEVE THESE DIMENSIONS OF HAPPINESS. MOST STUDIES HAVE BEEN EITHER IN DIRECTION OF SUBJECTIVE WELL- BEING OR DEVELOPMENTAL WELL- BEING. THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN IN AN EFFORT TO COMBINE BOTH THE FACTORS AND INCORPORATING AGE- OLD VALUES AND VIRTUES REQUIRED FOR REACHING HIGHER REALM OF LASTING PEACE, TRANQUILITY AND HAPPINESS FOR ONE AND ALL. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT MENTAL HAPPINESS HAS SIGNIFI CANT POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH MATERIALISTIC AND SPIRITUALISTIC HAPPINESS, PERHAPS FOR BEING THE INTERMEDIARY STEP, BUT MATERIALISTIC HAS NO SIGNIFI CANT CORRELATION WITH SPIRITUALISTIC HAPPINESS.
529	WHERE DOES HISTORY EDUCATION FIT INTO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND HOW CAN IT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GOALS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE? THE CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS BROADENED TO ENCOMPASS MORE THAN JUST PROSECUTIONS, REPARATIONS, PREVENTING IMPUNITY, AND BUILDING RULE OF LAW. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE GOALS NOW EXTEND TO TRUTH TELLING, RESTORING THE DIGNITY AND PRESERVING THE MEMORY OF VICTIMS, BUILDING PEACE, CREATING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY, AND TO RECONCILIATION. TOOLS FOR ACHIEVING THESE GOALS NOW INCLUDE TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND COMMEMORATIONS. BUT THIS LIST HAS NOT UNTIL NOW INCLUDED HOW THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE OF THE GROUP(S) INVOLVED IN CONFLICT MUST CHANGE AS A PART OF TRANSITION; AND EDUCATION, WHILE OFTEN INVOKED WHEN THE TOPIC OF 'NEVER AGAIN' IS RAISED, HAS BEEN LARGELY ABSENT FROM THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE DISCOURSE. NEITHER THE LARGER EDUCATION SYSTEM NOR THE TEACHING OF HISTORY - BOTH WHAT IS TAUGHT AND HOW - HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE INSTITUTIONS TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS AIMED TO REFORM. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHY HISTORY EDUCATION MATTERS, WHAT CONDITIONS COMPLICATE ITS REFORM AND WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BEGIN TO BE OFFERED WITH REGARD TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HISTORY EDUCATION AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
530	IN THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION, THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE VENEZUELAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SINCE 1999 IS EXPOSED WITH GREAT CLARITY, THROUGH THE LEGAL APPROACH OF REFORM, DEVELOPMENT AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNANCE, THROUGH DOCUMENTARY, DESCRIPTIVE, EXPLANATORY AND CRITICAL RESEARCH. THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM MUST START FROM A BASIC PREMISE: THE ABANDONMENT OF THE IDEA OF EXCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE STATE, WITHOUT CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, AND WITHOUT PROMOTING THE RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC FREEDOMS. VENEZUELA HAS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT INTERVENES IN EVERYTHING, AND THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING, WITHOUT LEAVING A MARGIN OF MANEUVER TO PUBLIC LIBERTIES; IT HAS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS GROWN REMARKABLY, IN ORGANIZATION AND ACTIVITY, BUT WITHOUT EFFICIENCY OR EFFECTIVENESS. THE INVESTIGATION ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE CONCEPT OF DEVELOPMENT IN VENEZUELA IS LEVERAGED FROM OIL RENTS: RENTIER CAPITALISM MUST BE OVERCOME. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT BRINGS AS A CONSEQUENCE THE EXPANSION OF FREEDOMS IN CONDITIONS OF EQUALITY, IN A FRAMEWORK OF PLURALISM, RULE OF LAW AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE STATE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON IRRATIONAL CHANGES, ON THE SIMPLE HOLDING OF POWER, PREROGATIVE AND PRIVILEGE, BUT RATHER, FOCUS ON THE ADMINISTERED.
531	TWO THIRDS OR MORE OF MADAGASCAR'S AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL FOR FOREST RESTORATION ARE LOCATED WHERE LAND TENURE IS UNCLEAR OR CONTESTED, ACCORDING TO A MIXED-METHOD ANALYSIS OF LAND TENURE STATUS DATA, STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TROPICAL COUNTRIES ARE MAKING AMBITIOUS COMMITMENTS TO FOREST LANDSCAPE RESTORATION WITH THE AIM OF LOCKING UP CARBON, CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY AND BENEFITING LOCAL LIVELIHOODS. HOWEVER, GLOBAL AND NATIONAL ANALYSES OF RESTORATION POTENTIAL FREQUENTLY IGNORE SOCIO-LEGAL COMPLEXITIES WHICH IMPACT BOTH THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EQUITABILITY OF RESTORATION. WE SHOW THAT AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST RESTORATION POTENTIAL ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY FOUND IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW AND FREQUENTLY IN THOSE WITH SUBSTANTIAL AREAS OF UNRECOGNISED LAND TENURE. FOCUSSING ON MADAGASCAR, AT LEAST 67% OF THE AREAS WITH HIGHEST RESTORATION POTENTIAL MUST BE ON UNTITLED LAND, WHERE TENURE IS OFTEN UNCLEAR OR CONTESTED, AND WE SHOW HOW UNRESOLVED TENURE ISSUES ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS ON FOREST RESTORATION. THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED AND WITHOUT IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO RESOLVE LOCAL TENURE ISSUES, OPPORTUNITIES TO EQUITABLY SCALE UP FOREST RESTORATION GLOBALLY ARE LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER-ESTIMATED.
532	USING AN INTERPRETATIVE METHODOLOGY, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO ANALYZE THE MOST COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE: THE PRINCIPLE OF THE JUDGE'S INTERNAL BELIEFS AT THE TIME OF DECISION MAKING UNDER A SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC CHECKS AND BALANCES. DEFINITELY, THE JUDICIARY IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE LEGITIMACY OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW. THE RUSTING OF THE JUDICIARY INEVITABLY LEADS TO THE GRADATION OF BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS ON THE ESSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. THE CORRECT CONSTRUCTION OF THE GIVEN PRINCIPLES IS THE KEY TO PROPER AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS. IN THIS SENSE, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE INTERNAL BELIEFS OF THE JUDGE AS A PERSON AUTHORIZED TO EXECUTE JUSTICE, MUST BE IMPARTIAL, OBJECTIVE, CONSISTENT AND INDEPENDENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE FORMULATION OF HIS "INTERNAL BELIEFS" STILL ALLOWS FOR SUBJECTIVITY, SINCE THE CRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE BY THE COURT ARE DESCRIBED WITHOUT DETAILING OR STANDARDIZING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.
533	OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COLOMBIAN STATE FOR THE FAILURE IN SERVICE DUE TO THE IMPORTATION OF VEHICLES THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH QUALITY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, IT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THAT THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ON VEHICLE SAFETY PROPOSE CRITERIA OF DISTINCTION THAT ARE UNSUSTAINABLE IN A SOCIAL STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. METHODOLOGY: THE METHODOLOGY USED WAS THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC, JURISPRUDENTIAL AND LEGAL SOURCES, AND THE REQUEST THROUGH PETITIONS TO THE CORRESPONDING ENTITIES (MINCYT, DIAN, MINTRANSPORTE). ONCE THE INFORMATION WAS ANALYZED AND SYSTEMATIZED, THE INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS TEXT WAS CARRIED OUT. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE IS COMPROMISED WITH THOSE VEHICLES THAT CIRCULATE WITHOUT THE SAFETY MEASURES ESTABLISHED IN RESOLUTION 3752 OF 2015, GIVEN THAT ALTHOUGH THIS RULE IS NOT RETROACTIVE, IT DOES EVIDENCE THAT THE STATE IS NOT ABLE TO PROTECT ALL COLOMBIANS IN THEIR LIFE, HONOR AND PROPERTY, AND THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT THE FAILURE IN THE SAFETY MEASURES IN IMPORTS HAS ALLOWED UNSAFE VEHICLES SUCH AS CABS WITHOUT STORAGE AND WITHOUT DUAL AIRBAGS, ABS BRAKES OR HEADRESTS TO CIRCULATE THROUGH THE CITIES WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONTROL TO THEIR
534	AS RESEARCH BY THE COMMISSION FOR RECEPTION, TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION IN EAST TIMOR DOCUMENTS, THE YEARS 1975-1980 CONSTITUTED THE WORST PERIOD OF THE INDONESIAN OCCUPATION OF EAST TIMOR, DURING WHICH GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS TOOK PLACE INVOLVING A HIGH LOSS OF LIFE. IN AUSTRALIA, THE GOVERNMENT HEADED BY PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM FRASER (1975-1983) SOUGHT TO PRESENT ITSELF AS A SUPPORTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO PRIORITIZED RELATIONS WITH THE SUHARTO REGIME, WHICH IT SAW AS KEY TO ITS POLICY POSITION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THESE TWO POSITIONS CAME INTO CONFLICT DUE TO THE INDONESIAN INVASION OF EAST TIMOR. THE FRASER GOVERNMENT THEREFORE WORKED TO PROPAGATE A NARRATIVE CONCERNING EAST TIMOR WHICH DENIED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, DISTORTED THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE, DEFLECTED BLAME FROM INDONESIA, AND DEPICTED THE AUSTRALIAN POSITION AS PRINCIPLED AND REALISTIC. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NARRATIVE AS EVENTS PROGRESSED AND INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CRISIS IN EAST TIMOR CAME TO THE ATTENTION OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IT ALSO EXAMINES HOW THE FRASER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYED THIS NARRATIVE INTERNATIONALLY IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE SUHARTO REGIME FROM SCRUTINY.
535	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES MAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE EU ENLARGEMENT STRATEGY/PROCESS BETWEEN THE ONE APPLIED FOR THE BIG-BANG EASTERN ENLARGEMENT IN 2004/2007 AND THE ONE BEING USED FOR THE EU ACCESSION OF THE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE KEY DRIVERS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWING DOWN OF THE EU ACCESSION PROCESS FOR THESE COUNTRIES OVER THE LAST DECADE. AMONG OTHERS, THESE DRIVERS INCLUDE SOME TRADITIONAL ONES, SUCH AS LESSONS FROM THE EU-10 ENLARGEMENT AND GENERAL "ENLARGEMENT FATIGUE" IN QUITE A NUMBER OF EU MEMBER STATES, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF MORE RECENT ONES, SUCH AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, THE MIGRANT/REFUGEE CRISIS AND THE BREXIT. THE REDUCED APPETITE OF THE EU MEMBER STATES FOR WESTERN BALKAN ENLARGEMENT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE RESHAPED EU ENLARGEMENT STRATEGY THAT IS NOW BASED ON THE SO-CALLED "FUNDAMENTALS FIRST" APPROACH WITH THE RULE OF LAW, EARLY RESOLUTION OF BILATERAL ISSUES AND STRENGTHENED ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AS ITS KEY PILLARS. BESIDES, THE ENLARGEMENT PROCESS IS RUN TODAY MUCH MORE ON THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL BASIS THAN THIS WAS THE CASE DURING THE LARGE EASTERN ENLARGEMENT.
536	THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL DRAFTING AND ITS ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS, WHICH HAS NOT DRAWN A LOT OF ATTENTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA SO FAR. THE PAPER EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN THE SIMPLICITY AND LEGAL DISTINCTNESS OF A LEGAL TEXT IN THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ITS CLARITY. THE PAPER ALSO PRESENTS OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR QUALITY LEGAL DRAFTING, AS WELL AS SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES OF THE DRAFTERS. WITH THE PURPOSE OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO IMPERFECTIONS IN THE LEGAL DRAFTING IN CROATIA, SOME DEFICIENCIES ARE PRESENTED IN THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING AND AMENDING OF THE UTILITY SERVICES ACT. THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING AND AMENDING OF THIS ACT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE WAY HOW LEGAL DRAFTING SHOULD NOT BE DONE. IT CONTAINS A LOT OF DEFICIENCIES AND FAILURES THAT ARE THE RESULT OF LEGAL DRAFTING MISTAKES. AT THE END, AUTHORS EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE UNIFORM METHODOLOGY AND NOMOTECHNICAL RULES FOR THE DRAFTING OF ACTS ENACTED BY PARLIAMENT SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGHER QUALITY OF LEGAL TEXTS AND TO THEIR FULL ADJUSTMENT TO THE GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND RULE OF LAW.
537	BRITAIN IS EXPERIENCING A PERIOD OF DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT CHALLENGES CENTURIES-OLD UNDERSTANDINGS OF BRITISH CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS, THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ENACTED A QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS; DEVOLVED LEGISLATIVE POWER TO SCOTLAND, WALES, AND NORTHERN IRELAND; AND CREATED A NEW SUPREME COURT. BRITISH ACADEMICS DEBATE HOW EACH ELEMENT OF THIS TRANSFORMATION CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD: IS IT CONSISTENT WITH POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND HISTORIC NOTIONS OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY, OR DOES IT USHER IN A NEW REGIME THAT PLACES EXTERNAL, RULE-OF-LAW-BASED LIMITS ON PARLIAMENT? MUCH OF THIS COMMENTARY EXAMINES THESE CHANGES IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION, FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SYSTEMIC FACTORS AT PLAY IN THE BRITISH SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE CUMULATIVE FORCE OF THE MANY RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, SHEDDING NEW LIGHT ON THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION. DRAWING ON THE U.S. LITERATURE ON FEDERALISM AND JUDICIAL POWER, THE ARTICLE ILLUMINATES THE ROLE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEVOLUTION IN THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE U.K. SUPREME COURT. WHETHER A RISING JUDICIARY WILL TRULY CHALLENGE BRITISH NOTIONS OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IS AS YET UNKNOWN, BUT SCHOLARS AND POLITICIANS SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE GROUNDWORK BEING LAID.
538	AFTER TWELVE MONTHS OF WORK, THE FINAL REPORT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE INCLUDES DETAILED PROPOSALS AND MEASURES TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES REGARDING ISSUES THAT WORRY CITIZENS AND THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS, AND THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL TACKLE IN THE FUTURE. SUCH PROPOSALS AND MEASURES ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER ALONG THE FOLLOWING AREAS: BUILDING HEALTH CONTINENT; FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES; ECONOMICS THAT WORKS FOR PEOPLE; SOCIAL FAIRNESS, EQUALITY AND INTERGENERATIONAL SOLIDARITY; EUROPE'S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION; EUROPEAN UNION IN THE WORLD; EUROPEAN RIGHTS AND VALUES, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, SECURITY; MIGRATION CHALLENGES; THE UNION'S DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATIONS; EDUCATION, CULTURE, YOUTH AND SPORT; AND HOW TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN ADDITION TO THE CONFERENCE'S OBJECTIVES, STRUCTURE AND OPERATION, AMONG THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MEASURES PROPOSED IN THE FINAL REPORT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE CONFERENCE, THIS CONTRIBUTION OUTLINES THOSE MEASURES, WHICH DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARE CONNECTED WITH TOPICS RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION COMPETENCES ON EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL POLICY. THE INITIAL REACTION OF THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS ON THE MONITORING OF MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE CONFERENCE IS ALSO COVERED BY THIS CONTRIBUTION.
539	IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WITH EMERGING ECONOMIES HAVE PROCEEDED TO USE MARKET-ORIENTED STRATEGIES, DEREGULATION AND REFORMS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT MORE FOREIGN INVESTORS AND ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS. THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN ATTRACTING FDI USING PANEL DATA AND COMPARING TWO GROUPS OF FAST-GROWING EMERGING COUNTRIES, NAMELY BRIC (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA) AND CIVETS (COLOMBIA, INDONESIA, VIETNAM, EGYPT, TURKEY AND SOUTH AFRICA). THE STUDY INCLUDES A PANEL DATA ANALYSIS USING THE LATEST AVAILABLE SECONDARY DATA RANGING FROM 2002 TO 2019. EMPIRICAL MODELS ARE EXTENDED AND PRESENTED. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT FDI INFLOWS IN BRICS ARE ATTRACTED BY RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, WHILE CIVETS ABSORB FDI INFLOWS DUE TO CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE SINCE IT IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN ATTRACTING FDI IN BRIC AND CIVETS ECONOMIES, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OTHER FDI DETERMINANTS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, IT IS THE FIRST PAPER TO STUDY AND COMPARE FDI AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS IN THE SPECIFIC GROUPS OF EMERGING COUNTRIES.
540	THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATES CONSIDER THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT TO VOTE, AS A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR ABOVE ALL OTHER RIGHTS. THE POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE DOMINANT ONLY DUE TO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION: PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXERCISE THEIR POWER ON THE ONE HAND AND TRANSFER THEIR POWER WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL UPHEAVALS ON THE OTHER. IN THIS REGARD, IT IS WORTH HIGHLIGHTING THAT POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE ONE OF THE CORNERSTONE RIGHTS FOR THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THIS THESIS, WE CAN PERSIST THAT THE PROBLEMS OF THE REALIZATION OF POLITICAL RIGHTS ARE DECISIVE AND HIGHLY IMPORTANT EVEN FOR THE DECLARED AND TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATES. IN THIS RESPECT, THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA IS NO EXCEPTION. THESE RIGHTS ARE AMONG THE MOST ACUTE SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT YOUNG ARMENIAN DEMOCRACY HAS FACED AFTER THE INDEPENDENCE. THE PROBLEMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTORAL RIGHTS HAVE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE REASONS. AMONG THE OBJECTIVE REASONS, WE CAN NOTE THE TRANSITIONAL CHARACTER OF ARMENIAN DEMOCRACY. IN TERM OF SUBJECTIVE REASONS, FIRSTLY, THE DISPROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES DIRECTED AGAINST POLITICAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE POINTED OUT, WHICH ARE THE CENTRAL OBSTACLES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLITICAL RIGHTS.
541	BEFORE THE BACKGROUND OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH LEGAL PLURALISM DEBATES MAY BE SEEN AS A WASTE OF TIME OR EVEN AS DANGEROUS FOR LEGAL CERTAINTY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN WELL-BEING, THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE PRACTICAL RELEVANCE AND AMELIORATIVE POTENTIAL OF PLURALIST LEGAL THEORISING AND ITS CONNECTION TO DAILY PRACTICE. THE OFTEN SILENT PLURALITY-CONSCIOUS NAVIGATION OF COMPETING VISIONS AND POSITIONS THAT MAY BE DELIBERATELY HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW IS HIGHLIGHTED HERE AS A CORE ELEMENT OF HOW LAW IS EXPERIENCED AND MANAGED AT VARIOUS LEVELS. WHILE SOME APPEALS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF DESIRED AIMS AND VISIONS ADDRESS AUTHORITY FIGURES, INCLUDING DEITIES, MUCH NAVIGATION AND BALANCING OF COMPETING VISIONS OF LAW AND SOCIAL ORDER TAKES PLACE BELOW OFFICIAL RADARS. INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS, PETITIONS AND PRAYERS, BUT ALSO MORE WIDE-RANGING CONSULTATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS MAY NOT ATTRACT MEDIA COVERAGE OR SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. HOWEVER, ONE FINDS EVIDENCE OF EFFORTS TO CREATE BETTER CONDITIONS FOR A GOOD LIFE THROUGH EXAMPLES OF SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF DIFFERENCE WITHOUT ARMED BATTLE, COSTLY CONFLICTS OR DRAMATIC STRUGGLES OVER DISAGREEMENTS. SUCH SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF DIFFERENT VISIONS MAY YIELD MOST INTERESTING RESULTS, EVEN IF MUCH REMAINS DELIBERATELY UNSPOKEN.
542	IT HAS BEEN WIDELY ARGUED THAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES HAVE ROLES IN THE PREDOMINANCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OUR PAPER SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE THIS CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BY INVESTIGATING THE WAYS IN WHICH COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES INFLUENCED THE PREDOMINANCE OF FOREIGN HOLDINGS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2010-2015. THE STUDY USED PANEL SAMPLING ANNUAL DATA FROM THIRTY COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, WITH ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (OLS) AND FEASIBLE GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES (FGLS) AS OUR DISCUSSION ESTIMATORS. OUR STATISTICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE PREDOMINANCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP PREDOMINATES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN ECONOMIES THAT HAVE SOUND POLITICAL STABILITY AND EMBRACE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT REGULATIONS. MOREOVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND THE PREVALENCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IS NEGATIVE BUT SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, ARE INSIGNIFICANT TO THE PREDOMINANCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA SHOULD ADOPT ROBUST AND EFFICACIOUS MEASURES, STRENGTHEN THEIR POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS TO PROMOTE THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, PROVIDE QUALITY REGULATIONS, AND MINIMIZE POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
543	JUST LIKE THE RULE OF LAW, THE PHYSICAL SPACE OF THE COURTROOM IS A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. AND SPACE IS NOT NEUTRAL; RATHER, IT CONVEYS THE IDEALS THAT GOVERN INSTITUTIONS, DIRECT BODIES, AND DETERMINE BEHAVIOUR. WHILE THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE SYMBOLIC SPACE WHERE THE TRIAL TAKES PLACE IS TO LEGITIMIZE THE INSTITUTION, IT ALSO INTIMIDATES AND EVEN MARGINALIZES THE UNINITIATED. THUS, AT A TIME WHEN THE SPECIAL COMMISSION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD AND YOUTH PROTECTION IS EXAMINING YOUTH PROTECTION SERVICES AND THE ROLE OF THE COURTS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALSO EXAMINE HOW ARCHITECTURE AFFECTS YOUTH JUSTICE. THIS PAPER FIRST ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF PHYSICAL SPACE IN LAW. THEN, BUILDING ON THE PREMISE THAT BOTH THE YOUTH PROTECTION SYSTEM AND THE YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE INTERESTS AND NEEDS OF THE CHILD, THE CLASSIC ELEMENTS OF COURTROOM SPACE WILL BE PRESENTED AND COMPARED WITH THE LITERATURE ON CHILD-FRIENDLY SPACES. TO USE VALERY'S EXPRESSION, THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE YOUTH DIVISION SHOULD LIMIT THE USUAL RECTITUDE AND SOLEMNITY IN FAVOUR OF SPACE THAT EVOKES A CERTAIN FAMILIARITY : SPACE THAT SINGS.
544	TAKING THE CASE OF ROMANIAN CITIZENS IN FRANCE, THIS ARTICLE DOCUMENTS AND ANALYSES THE DIGITAL METHODS AND TRADITIONAL POLICE ACTIVITIES USED FOR THE DEPORTATION OF EU CITIZENS ACROSS THE SCHENGEN BORDER AND WITHIN EU TERRITORY. EU LAWS AND SCHENGEN REGULATIONS SUPPORT STATES' IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGH-TECH METHODS IN MIGRATION GOVERNANCE AND POLICE WORK. OUR FIELDWORK, CONDUCTED WITH SEVERAL POLICE UNITS IN FRANCE AND ROMANIA, INDICATES A GAP BETWEEN THE CLAIMED 'CONTROLLED' MANAGEMENT OF MOBILITY THROUGH CRIMMIGRATION AND THE ACTUAL MESSINESS AT THE SCHENGEN BORDER AS A RESULT OF POLICY IMPLEMENTATION LIMITATIONS (LACK OF LEGISLATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DIGITAL DEMANDS), POOR ADMINISTRATION (TRAINING OF BORDER AGENTS, ALLOCATING RESOURCES) AND POLITICAL DECISIONS (HARMONISATION OR COMPETING NARRATIVES). DESPITE THE PROMOTION OF CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE DEPORTATION PROCESS, TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS PAPERWORK REMAIN RELEVANT. THIS RAISES QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ARTICULATIONS OF TRADITIONAL TECHNIQUES WITH HIGHLY PROMOTED CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES. WHILE THE LATTER HAS MODIFIED THE FUNCTIONING OF THE DEPORTATION PROCESS, THESE CHANGES DO NOT NECESSARILY MAKE THE FORMER USELESS. IN PRACTICE, THIS WORK IS LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF POLICE OFFICERS AND GROUND-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS WHO INTERPRET, CREATE AND ENFORCE NORMS AND REGULATIONS IN THE NAME OF 'THE RULE OF LAW'.
545	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE ISSUES OF POLITICAL TECHNOLOGIES OF EDUCATION OF LEGAL CULTURE OF THE POPULATION, WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN STUDIED IN POLITICAL SCIENCE. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES IN MORE DETAIL THE FORMS, METHODS, TECHNIQUES, METHODS AND MEANS OF POLITICAL TECHNOLOGIES OF EDUCATION OF LEGAL CULTURE OF KAZAKH PEOPLE. ON THE BASIS OF THE CONDUCTED STUDIES, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE EDUCATION OF THE LEGAL CULTURE OF THE POPULATION IS CARRIED OUT IN KAZAKHSTAN BY: STATE BODIES; SPECIAL BODIES ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW (PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, COURT, BODIES OF THE MINISTRIES OF JUSTICE, INTERNAL AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE); PARTY AND PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS; LABOR COLLECTIVES; EDUCATIONAL BODIES, HIGHER AND SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, MASS MEDIA AND PROPAGANDA, CREATIVE UNIONS AND INSTITUTIONS OF CULTURE AND ART. AT THE SAME TIME, IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT POLITICAL TECHNOLOGIES, FORMS, METHODS, TECHNIQUES AND MEANS OF EDUCATION OF THE LEGAL CULTURE OF THE POPULATION OF KAZAKHSTAN ARE MOBILE, THEY CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND CHANGES IN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AND TASKS, ARE IMPROVED WITH THE ADVENT OF NEW POLITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE DISCUSSION ISSUES.
546	IN HIS DISCUSSION OF HUMOR IN DE ORATORE (2.284), CICERO REPORTS A JOKE THAT APPIUS CLAUDIUS MADE IN THE SENATE AT THE EXPENSE OF L. LICINIUS LUCULLUS WITH WORD PLAY ON LIBER, "FREE." THE QUIP OFTEN FIGURES IN SCHOLARSHIP ON PUBLIC LAND, BECAUSE IT OCCURRED IN A DEBATE ABOUT A LAW ON THE TOPIC. BUT THE JOKE REVEALS LITTLE ABOUT LAWS ON PUBLIC LAND. INSTEAD, IT IS AN IMPORTANT ARTEFACT OF REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CULTURE. IN ITS ORIGINAL SECOND CENTURY BCE CONTEXT THE JOKE PERPETRATED A CODED POLITICAL ATTACK, USING LEGAL EXPERTISE TO REINFORCE THE POLITICAL HIERARCHY. IN THE NEXT CENTURY, THE JOKE HAD AN AFTERLIFE IN CICERO'S DE ORATORE, WHERE IT PLAYED INTO CONTEMPORARY ANXIETIES ABOUT POLITICAL FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW. TO ILLUMINATE THE IMPLICATIONS OF HIS JOKE, THIS PAPER FIRST CONTEXTUALIZES THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF LIBER WITHIN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES RELATING TO PUBLIC LAND. THEN IT EXAMINES THE JOKE AS A MEDIUM OF ELITE IDENTITY, AND CONCLUDES WITH THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF THIS HUMOR FOR REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CULTURE BY READING THE JOKE WITH VARRO'S DE RE RUSTICA AS INTERTEXT.
547	THIS PAPER EXTENDS THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION BY ANALYZING THE FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION ON POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY IN THE WORLD AND ASIA. WE CONSTRUCT A NEW FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDICATORS TO ASSESS VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR 176 ECONOMIES, INCLUDING 37 OF WHICH FROM DEVELOPING ASIA. WE TEST THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION, ALONG WITH OTHER CONTROL VARIABLES, ON POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY. WE DO SO FOR FULL SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES AND THEN FOR DEVELOPING ASIA SAMPLE TO ACCESS WHICH FACTORS ARE RELEVANT FOR FULL SAMPLE AND FOR DEVELOPING ASIA SPECIFICALLY. THE ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOW THAT PER CAPITA INCOME, RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR BOTH WORLD AND ASIA SAMPLES. HOWEVER, PRIMARY EDUCATION COMPLETION AND LITERACY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES FINANCIAL INCLUSION ONLY IN THE FULL SAMPLE, NOT FOR THE ASIAN SAMPLE. THE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION IS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH LOWER POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY LEVELS FOR THE FULL SAMPLE. FOR DEVELOPING ASIA, HOWEVER, THERE APPEARS TO BE NO LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND INCOME INEQUALITY.
548	IN THIS PAPER, I DISCUSS DEIRDRE MCCLOSKEY'S ARGUMENT THAT 'IDEAS, NOT CAPITAL OR INSTITUTIONS,' WERE THE CAUSE OF THE 'GREAT ENRICHMENT,' THE SPECTACULAR GROWTH OF THE WORLD ECONOMY SINCE 1800. I DISAGREE THAT THE IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY ALONE CAUSED THE GREAT ENRICHMENT BUT AGREE THAT THESE IDEAS WERE CENTRAL AND NECESSARY FOR IT. MOST THEORISTS OF DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC HISTORY FAIL TO RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE IDEAS DESPITE IMPLICITLY ASSUMING THEM IN WHAT I CALL THE 'NEOCLASSICAL FALLACY.' I ALSO EXTEND MCCLOSKEY'S VIEWS TO INCLUDE A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY THROUGH THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH NECESSARILY INVOLVES INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE POLITICAL OFFICIALS WITH INCENTIVES TO HONOUR THESE IDEAS IN PRACTICE. IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY ARE NOT SELF-IMPLEMENTING, AND MOST ATTEMPTS TO IMPLEMENT THEM FAIL. FINALLY, I ARGUE THAT A RANGE OF POLITICAL THEORISTS FROM HOBBES TO MADISON STUDIED THE PROBLEM OF IMPLEMENTING LIBERTY AND EQUALITY. IN THE 150 YEARS PRIOR TO 1800, THEY HELPED DEVISE A SERIES OF INSTITUTIONS THAT SUSTAINED LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE IDEAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GREAT ENRICHMENT.
549	THIS PAPER USES RECENT DATA ON HISTORICAL OIL WEALTH TO PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF OIL WEALTH ON DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA FROM 1955 TO 2008. WE FIND THAT OIL WEALTH IS STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF DEMOCRATIZATION WHEN WE ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP IN A POOLED CROSS-SECTIONAL AND TIME-SERIES SETTING. IN ADDITION, WHEN ESTIMATED USING FIXED EFFECTS AND IV-2SLS METHODS, THE STRONG NEGATIVE STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION CONTINUES TO HOLD. INDEED, THIS RESULT IS ROBUST TO THE SOURCE OF OIL WEALTH DATA, THE CHOICE AND TREATMENT OF THE VARIABLES SET, AND THE SAMPLE SELECTION. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW OTHER INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT RESULTS. THE CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE EXAMINED IN THE STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE LIPSET/ARISTOTLE/MODERNIZATION HYPOTHESIS' (THAT PROSPERITY STIMULATES DEMOCRACY) IS A STRONG EMPIRICAL REGULARITY. ALSO, THE PROPENSITY FOR DEMOCRACY RISES WITH POPULATION SIZE, POPULATION DENSITY, ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION, HAVING BRITISH LEGAL ORIGIN OR COLONIAL HERITAGE, AND HAVING A SUPPORTIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE FORM OF MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, APART FROM OIL WEALTH, DEMOCRACY TENDS TO FALL WITH LINGUISTIC FRACTIONALIZATION AND ROUGH (MOUNTAINOUS) TERRAIN. MOREOVER, CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA, NORTH AFRICA CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO FAVOR DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT.
550	THE MODERN ERA HAS AWOKEN A PERIOD OF EXTREME TERROR USED BOTH BY STATES AND AGAINST THEM TO ATTACK PEOPLES OR THEIR WAY OF LIFE. MODERNITY ALSO GAVE RISE TO HUMAN RIGHTS, HUMANITARIAN IDEALS AND WITH THE RULE OF LAW; A GROWING BELIEF IN THE POWER OF LAW TO DELIVER SAFETY AND JUSTICE. UNFORTUNATELY, NEITHER INTERNAL STATE NOR INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS YET DELIVERED A JUST SYSTEM OF DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS. EVEN WHEN CALLED TO ACCOUNT PUNISHMENT FALLS SHORT OF WHAT MANY EXPECT. LAW AND PUNISHMENT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE FRACTURED LOCUS OF POWER AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE TORN MORAL ALLEGIANCE THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY HUMAN RIGHTS ATROCITIES. INTERNATIONAL LAW FAILS TO DELIVER EITHER RETRIBUTION OR DETERRENCE. LAW (INTERNATIONAL AND STATE) AND PUNISHMENT NEED TO SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT FOCUS, ONE DESIGNED TO SUSTAIN AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS, ONE WHICH MIGHT RESTORE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS BACK INTO THE RIGHTS FAMILY. DUFF'S EXPRESSIVE THEORY OF PUNISHMENT OFFERS A SOLUTION. IT EXPECTS CLEAR AND WIDE CONDEMNATION OF ATROCITIES TO BE EXPRESSED WHILST GUIDING PERPETRATORS TO FACE THEIR MORAL GUILT, TO PUBLICLY REPENT AND IMPROVE THEIR MORAL STANDING SO PERMITTING REINTEGRATION INTO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
551	WE FOCUS ON MORAL CLIMATES THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF THREE STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) IN A SOUTH CHINA CITY. IN COMPANY A, A SHIPBUILDING COMPANY, THE GENERAL MANAGER PERSUADED THE SUPERVISORY BUREAU TO ALLOW HIM TO REPLACE THE OLD TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH MANAGERS CHOSEN ON MERIT, AND WHO SUPPORTED HIS DESIRE FOR REFORMS. HE EXERCISED TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP, ESTABLISHED INTERNAL RULE OF LAW, CULTIVATED A SPIRITED MORAL CLIMATE, AND ACHIEVED TURNAROUND. AT COMPANY B, A FINANCIAL SERVICES CONGLOMERATE, THE GENERAL MANAGER EXPLOITED STRONG POLITICAL CONNECTIONS, ENFEEBLED THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, AND WITH TWO SUBSIDIARY BARONS PROCEEDED TO MILK COMPANY RESOURCES. THAT, AND A LARGE CONTINGENT OF SLEEPING INCUMBENTS ( IDLE PROTEGES), BRED A MORAL CLIMATE OVERRUN BY CORRUPTION, DERELICTION OF DUTY AND HUBRIS. BANKRUPTCY WAS NOT AVERTED. HOTEL X, A SUBSIDIARY OF COMPANY B, WAS A PARTIAL MACHINE BUREAUCRACY; ITS MORAL CLIMATE CHARACTERISED BY PUNISHMENT AVOIDANCE AND LACK OF SPIRIT. A HEADQUARTERS POWER BLOC AND THE SLEEPING INCUMBENTS WHOM THEY PROTECTED PREVENTED A LAW ABIDING, EQUITY SENSITIVE GENERAL MANAGER FROM IMPROVING PERFORMANCE, AND HE LOST HEART. FROM THESE CASES, WE BUILD A MODEL OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORAL LEADERSHIP, INSTITUTIONAL SUPERSTRUCTURE, INTERNAL GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, ENTERPRISE MORAL ATMOSPHERE, AND PERFORMANCE.
552	INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES (IDSBS), THROUGH THEIR JUDGEMENTS, HAVE CONSISTENTLY URGED THE STATES TO TAKE SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE FOR MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THERE HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIGNIFICANT JURISPRUDENCE WHICH UNDERTAKE POLICY PRINCIPLES WITH SCIENTIFIC PRESCRIPTION IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THE JURISPRUDENCE RELATING TO MARITIME DISPUTE RESOLUTION HAS PRIMARILY RELIED ON THE INTERPRETATIVE CRITERIA OF 'INTEGRATION' FOR SCIENCE AND POLICY AS SPECIFIED IN THE VIENNA CONVENTION. INDEED, THIS PRINCIPLE OF 'INTEGRATION' INTEGRATED 'SCIENCE-POLICY' THROUGH VARIOUS CONCEPTS, AND IDSBS APPLIED AND ENDORSED THE 'RULE OF LAW', 'COOPERATION', 'PRECAUTION' AND 'ECOSYSTEM-BASED APPROACH' TO LAY STRESS ON THE PROGRESSIVE OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THIS ALSO REFLECTS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS IN JURISPRUDENCE DEMONSTRATES A CHANGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS' INTERESTS (OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY). MOREOVER, IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED AT THE END HOW THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CAN BE PURPOSEFULLY DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED TO PROTECT THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS IN LIGHT OF THE DECISIONS OF THE IDSBS. THIS RESEARCH ARTICLE ANALYSED THE RELEVANT JURISPRUDENCE TO EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLES FOR SCIENCE-POLICY INTEGRATION, WHICH OPERATES IN OCEAN GOVERNANCE FOR MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
553	THE STUDY HYPOTHESIZES THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) OF THE HOST COUNTRY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM (CDM) IMPLEMENTATION. AS CDM INCORPORATES SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES FOR THE GREEN TRANSITION, MANY COUNTRIES ENDEAVOR TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT CDM AS THEIR CLEANER PRODUCTION METHOD. BASED ON THE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, THE STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THE INSTITUTIONAL PROCESS OF EACH ESG PILLAR MAKES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HOST COUNTRY AND TO SEE HOW SUCH COUNTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS INFLUENCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CDM PROJECTS. A COUNTY-YEAR UNBALANCED SAMPLE DRAWN FROM WORLD BANK AND MULTINATIONAL CDM PROJECT DATA WAS ANALYZED USING PANEL LOGISTIC AND POISSON REGRESSION. PANEL REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT HIGH-ENERGY INTENSITY AND LOW RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY OUTPUT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL PILLAR POSITIVELY AFFECT CDM IMPLEMENTATION. UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDERNOURISHMENT AS A SOCIAL PILLAR POSITIVELY AFFECT CDM WHEREAS LOW GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE HIGH RULE OF LAW POSITIVELY AFFECT CDM. IN THE RESULTS OF ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION, THE DIRECTION OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS WAS UPTURNED. THE FINDINGS HAVE BROADENED AND DEEPENED THE ESG PILLAR BASED ON THE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND EMPHASIZED SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN ECONOMIC OUTPUTS.
554	IT IS OFTEN ARGUED THAT REBUILDING STATE CAPACITY FOLLOWING INTRASTATE CONFLICT WILL SERVE TO STABILIZE THE POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT. PAST SCHOLARSHIP HAS SOUGHT TO FORMALLY MODEL THE EFFECT OF RISING STATE CAPACITY. YET, TWO MODELS OF POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENTS PRODUCE CONFLICTING EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EFFECT OF STATE CAPACITY ON THE COMMITMENT PROBLEM AND THE PROSPECT FOR PEACE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION. THIS PROJECT SUMMARIZES THE CORE LOGIC OF THE TWO MODELS, COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THEIR ASSUMPTIONS, AND DERIVES A SET OF HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PEACE AGREEMENTS. THESE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED USING DATA FROM THE PEACE ACCORDS MATRIX. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INCREASES IN MILITARY CAPACITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF PEACE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION. HOWEVER, INCREASES IN STATE CAPACITY RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THE STARTING LEVEL OF COERCIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY APPEARS TO BE UNCORRELATED WITH THE DEGREE TO WHICH PEACE AGREEMENTS ARE IMPLEMENTED. THIS FINDING POINTS TO A POSSIBLE EARLY WARNING FOR PEACE AGREEMENT BREAKDOWN. LIKEWISE, IT SUGGESTS THAT STATE BUILDING MAY BE LESS A DRIVER OF POST-CONFLICT SUCCESS THAN IT IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE PREFERENCES OF KEY ACTORS.
555	THIS PAPER TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF DISCOURSE ABOUT LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AMONG POLISH-VIETNAMESE PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS, SINCE THEIR ORIGINAL MOBILISATIONS IN THE 1990S UNTIL TODAY. DOCUMENTING WHAT I CALL THE TWO WAVES OF POLISH-VIETNAMESE ACTIVISM, I DESCRIBE HOW THEIR 'DIASPORIC LIBERALISM' SHIFTED FROM A STANCE OF OPPOSITION TO COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY, AND FROM A BELIEF IN THE 'END OF HISTORY', TO AN APPROACH FOCUSED ON BOTTOM-UP DEMOCRATISATION AND EMBRACE OF TRANSNATIONAL FRAMES OF ENVIRONMENTALISM, RULE OF LAW, RIGHTS AND 'CIVIL SOCIETY'. SUCH EVOLUTION OF ACTIVISTS' DISCOURSES AND NETWORKS ULTIMATELY TRACKS THE TRANSFORMATION OF WESTERN LIBERALISM ITSELF, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE ASCENDANCY OF NEOLIBERAL IMAGERY OF GROUND-UP CITIZENLY EMPOWERMENT AND, MORE RECENTLY, THE EMERGENT RIGHT-WING CHALLENGE TO LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC ORDER IN EUROPE, IN RESPONSE TO NEOLIBERAL DISLOCATION OF THE TRADITIONAL WORKING CLASS. ANALYSING THE ACTIVISTS' SHIFTING ENGAGEMENTS WITH POLISH LIBERAL THOUGHT AND VIETNAM'S SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY, THIS PAPER MAKES THE CASE FOR THINKING OF LIBERALISM AS LACKING AN ORIGINAL OR ESSENTIAL FORM. RATHER IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF IN DIASPORA-LIKE TERMS, AS A 'GLOBALLY MOBILE CATEGORY', BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE IN VARIED, SITUATED WAYS THROUGH ONGOING MOBILISATION.
556	THIS ARTICLE RAISES THE RELEVANCE OF USING WESTERNS, SUCH AS THE FILMS THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (FORD, 1962) AND PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID (PECKINPAH, 1973), AS WELL AS THE VIDEOGAME RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 (ROCKSTAR GAMES, 2018), TO ADDRESS THE PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION OF A STATE RULED BY LAW. THESE CONTENTS HAS BEEN ANALYZED IN RELATION WITH VARIOUS INTRODUCTORY SUBJECTS TO LAW THROUGHOUT AN UNDERGRADUATED PROGRAM. IN THIS SENSE, THESE FILMS AND VIDEOGAMES HAVE BEEN ANALYZED CONSIDERING THE WAY THEY DEAL WITH KEY ISSUES IN THE PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION OF THE LAW: 1) THE PASSAGE FROM THE STATE OF NATURE TO THE RULE OF LAW; 2) THE RELATIONS BETWEEN POLITICAL POWER AND THE LAW REGARDING THE PROBLEM OF LEGITIMACY; 3) THE PRODUCTIVE NATURE OF THE LAW AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROCESS OF CIVILIZATION; 4) THE AMBIVALENCE OF THE PROCESS OF CIVILIZATION, AND 5) THE RELEVANCE OF THE MYTHICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR THE STATE AND FOR THE LAW. FROM THAT ANALYSIS, THE USEFULNESS OF THESE RESOURCES TO PUT IN CONTEXT THE ORIGINS OF THE CURRENT LEGAL-STATE REGIME CAN BE INFERED. THUS ALSO ALLOWS A MORE APOROPRIATE APPROACH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONTEMPORARY LEGAL SCIENCE.
557	YOUNG DEMOCRACIES FACE MANY CHALLENGES; THEY MUST ADOPT AND DEVELOP THE VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THOSE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE STRENGTHENING CIVIL SOCIETY. THE CULTURE OF LEGALITY CAN BE SEEN AS THE MEANS WHEREBY LEGITIMACY IS GRANTED TO EXISTING INSTITUTIONS, IN ORDER TO LEND THEM VALIDITY. UNLESS CITIZENS USE THE LAW TO REGULATE THEIR BEHAVIOR OR INSTITUTIONS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO RESOLVE THEIR CONFLICTS AND PROTECT AND PROMOTE THEIR INTERESTS, REFORMS ARE OF LITTLE USE IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE WAY LATIN AMERICANS RELATE TO THE LAW AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. WHILE RECOGNIZING THE HETEROGENEITY WITHIN THE REGION, SOME DISTINCTIVE FEATURES THAT APPEAR IN THE EXISTING COMPARABLE INFORMATION BASES ARE DESCRIBED: THE LB AND THE WVS SINCE 2000. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL REFORMS AND THE FUNCTIONING OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ENDEMIC MISTRUST PERVADING THE CITIZENS OF THIS REGION. ALTHOUGH DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT IS GRADUAL, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING HOW LATIN AMERICANS RELATE TO THE LAW, AT LEAST IN ATTITUDINAL TERMS.
558	CHIANG KAI-SHEK LAUNCHED THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT IN NANCHANG IN FEBRUARY 1934 TO REVIVE TRADITIONAL MORALITY BY REFORMING PEOPLE'S DAILY BEHAVIOR. IN RESPONSE TO CIVIL LEADER WANG JINGWEI'S CHALLENGE, CHIANG AGREED TO DEPLOY MORAL SUASION TO URGE THE CHINESE PEOPLE TO OBSERVE THE NEW LIFE DIRECTIVES, BUT HE STILL INTEGRATED THE MOVEMENT INTO GOVERNMENT ROUTINE AND RELIED ON GOVERNMENT AGENTS, ESPECIALLY POLICEMEN, TO IMPLEMENT IT. CONTEMPORARY POLITICIANS AND COMMENTATORS UNDERSTOOD THIS MOVEMENT AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO CULTIVATE QUALIFIED CITIZENS AND TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL ORDER IN THE POWER VOID CAUSED BY THE RETREAT OF THE TRADITIONAL RULE OF MORALITY AND THE DEFICIENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW, SO THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT WAS LOCATED IN A NEW DOMAIN OF STATE CONTROL BETWEEN MORALITY AND LAW. ALTHOUGH THIS NEW DOMAIN WAS SIMILAR TO THE WESTERN STATE APPARATUS OF DISCIPLINING THE POPULATION TO PRODUCE "DOCILE BODIES" IN THE FOUCAULDIAN SENSE, IT WAS ACTUALLY AN INTEGRAL PART OF CHINA'S OWN MODERNIZING PROCESS, IN WHICH THE STATE REDEFINED ITS MORAL AND LEGAL ROLE IN PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIVES IN ORDER TO BUILD A MODERN NATION-STATE.
559	UNDER ITS QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO STRIVE FOR THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ACTS AS LITIGATOR AND POLITICAL MEDIATOR IN DIPLOMATIC PRACTICE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS AND PRACTICAL MATERIAL WHERE THE UNION LITIGATED CASES AS A PARTY BEFORE THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION OR UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES, OR SUBMITTED AMICUS CURIAE BRIEFS BEFORE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. IT THEN RECALLS THE EUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONFLICT MANAGEMENT THROUGH MILITARY, POLICE, RULE OF LAW AND BORDER MISSIONS BASED ON A REQUEST FROM THE THIRD PARTY OR THE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED. MOREOVER, THE EUS ROLE IN THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND GEORGIA, IN THE CYPRUS PROBLEM AND IN THE SLOVENIA/CROATIA BORDER CONFLICT IS REVIEWED. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE OF RELEVANT BRUSSELS-BASED PRACTICE SUPPORTING THE PRINCIPLE OF PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, AS ENSHRINED UNDER ARTICLE 33 OF THE UN CHARTER. THE FACT THAT SUCH PRACTICES STEM FROM AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION SHOWS THAT THE PRINCIPLE REMAINS A MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GLOBAL LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH ENCOMPASSES ALL INTERNATIONAL ACTORS.
560	COMMUNAL VIOLENCE WRACKED THE STATE OF GUJARAT AND THE CITY OF AHMEDABAD ONCE AGAIN IN 2002, LEAVING SONIC 2,000 PEOPLE DEAD. BECAUSE THE RULING BJP PARTY HAD PROCLAIMED GUJARAT THE 'LABORATORY OF HINDUTVA', ANALYSTS THROUGHOUT. INDIA SAW, THE VIOLENCE AS BJP POLICY AND DEBATED ITS POSSIBLE SPILLOVER EFFECTS ELSEWHERE. THIS PAPER FINDS THAT IN A PERIOD ALREADY MARKED BY STRESSFUL ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CHANGE AND ATTENDED BY POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, SOME BJP LEADERS GAMBLED THAT AN ATTACK ON GUJARAT'S MUSLIMS, AND ON THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL, WOULD ATTRACT FOLLOWERS AND VOTERS. THEIR GAMBLE PROVED CORRECT: AT LEAST ILL THE SHORT RUN. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CULTURAL, SOCIAL, GEOGRAPHICAL AND EDUCATIONAL RESTRUCTURING THAT IS OCCURRING, THROUGH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL STRUGGLES, AND THE IMPACT OF THE VIOLENCE UPON THESE PROCESSES. IT EXAMINES THE DECLINING STATUS OF MUSLIMS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUOUS PROPAGANDA AGAINST THEM. IT ANALYZES THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE STATE WAS DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION FOR VIOLENCE AND ASKS ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH LEADERS DO, OR DO NOT, WISH TO 'PUT IT BEHIND THEM', AND SUGGESTS THAT AHMEDABAD'S PROBLEMS ARE WIDELY SHARED IN BOTH THE DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED WORLDS.
561	IN SETTING HEALTH CARE PRIORITIES THE LAW, AND IN PARTICULAR THE CONSTITUTION, HAS TO BE OBEYED. THE SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONAL STATE MUST GUARANTEE MINIMUM ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. MEMBERS OF THE STATUTORY HEALTH INSURANCE (SHI) SHALL HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROTECTING THEIR LIFE AND ENSURING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY. THEY SHALL NOT BE DISCRIMINATED ACCORDING TO GENDER, RACE AND ETHNIC ORIGIN, LANGUAGE, DISABILITY, AGE AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ESSENTIAL DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE MADE BY THE LEGISLATOR. WITHIN THE EC THE RIGHT TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN ANOTHER EC MEMBER STATE MAY BE AN OBSTACLE TO PRIORITISATION ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, E.G., TO WAITING LISTS. THE EXCLUSION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON THE BASIS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY LAW MAY BE TOO SIMPLISTIC AN APPROACH. ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION NEEDS PRIORITIES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE ARE SET TO MEET POLITICAL PRIORITIES AND REAL NEEDS. THE DECISIONS OF THE FEDERAL JOINT COMMITTEE (GEMEINSAMER BUNDESAUSSCHUSS) ARE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH BUT HAVE TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW. THERE ARE DEFICITS IN RESEARCH ON THE PRIORITISATION EFFECTS OF HEALTH CARE LAW. DIMINISHING THESE DEFICITS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR TURNING POLITICAL PRIORITIES INTO EFFECTIVE LEGAL PROVISIONS.
562	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RESPONSE OF THE POSTCOLONIAL STATE TO THE QUESTION OF WIDOW IMMOLATION - SATI. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CONVERSATION ON THE PRACTICE OF SATI AT THE HIGH POINT OF HINDU LAW REFORM IN THE 1950S REFLECTED THE SIMULTANEOUS PRESSURES ON THE NEW DEMOCRACY TO ESTABLISH RULE OF LAW WHILE ALSO ACCOMMODATING THE RENEWED REVERENCE FOR TRADITION AND RELIGIOUS CUSTOM IN AN INDEPENDENT NATION STATE. DISTINCT FROM THE COLONIAL RESPONSE TO SATI THAT TREATED WOMEN AS EITHER "HELPLESS AND PATHETIC" OR "BRAVE AND VALIANT," POST-INDEPENDENCE POLICE RECORDS DESCRIBE WOMEN COMMITTING SATI MOSTLY AS "INSANE" OR "NOT IN THEIR SENSES," AND YET CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THE ARTICLE CONTRASTS ADMINISTRATIVE AND PARLIAMENTARY NARRATIVES OF THE CRIME. LOCAL BELIEF IN MIRACLES SURROUNDING THE PERFORMANCE OF SATI NOT ONLY OBSCURED THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WOMAN'S SUFFERING BUT ALSO MADE COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE IN SUCH A CASE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT. THIS RENDERED CONVICTIONS OF THE ABETTORS OF SUCH "PAINLESS SUICIDE BY INSANE WOMEN" WEAKER. LEGAL INTERVENTIONS IN SATI EVENTUALLY PROMPTED ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSES TO SHIFT FROM EMPHASIZING THE "UNCONTROLLABILITY" OF THE SPECTACLE TO DEEMING THE SPECTACLE A NECESSARY PRECONDITION IN DISTINGUISHING A SATI FROM SUICIDE.
563	JUDICIAL CONTROL AND AUTHORIZATION OF STATE COERCION OR OTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE SPHERE OF PRIVATE LEGAL INTEREST IS A UNIVERSAL STANDARD FOR BUILDING A POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. TO OBTAIN RELIABLE AND SUBSTANTIATED CONCLUSIONS, GENERAL AND SPECIAL RESEARCH METHODS WERE USED, WHICH PROCESSED THE RESULTS OF THEORETICAL RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS IN UKRAINE, MATERIALS OF LEGAL PRACTICE IN THE FORM OF CONCLUSIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS AND UKRAINIAN COURTS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE PROPOSED REGULATORY CHANGES, WHICH DETERMINE THE DOMINANT ROLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS IN THE APPLICATION OF SANCTIONS RELATED TO THE ASSETS OF INDIVIDUALS OR THE PROHIBITION OF POLITICAL PARTIES, PERFORM A DUAL FUNCTION - TO ENSURE THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND INTERESTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS PROTECT THE NATIONAL INTERESTS, NATIONAL SECURITY, SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE, COUNTER TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS PREVENT VIOLATIONS, RESTORE VIOLATED RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF CITIZENS OF UKRAINE, SOCIETY AND THE STATE. THUS, THE PRECONDITIONS HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR RESOLVING THESE COMPLEX HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WHILE MAINTAINING THE NECESSARY BALANCE, EVEN IN EXCEPTIONAL MARTIAL LAW.
564	THE PURPOSE OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE PROBLEM OF EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND SUGGEST SOLUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE, GENERAL AND SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH METHODS WERE USED, IN PARTICULAR SYSTEM-FUNCTIONAL METHOD, DIALECTICAL AND STATISTICAL METHODS, METHOD OF HERMENEUTICS. THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL CANNOT BE LIMITED, AS THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE STATE IS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATION OF MOST COUNTRIES, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS RECOGNIZED, AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO APPLY TO THE COURT, AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS OF 1950 (ECHR) AS THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. COURTS EXIST TO MEET HUMAN NEEDS AND TO PROMOTE THE PRESERVATION OF SOCIAL VALUES. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM MUST BE EFFICIENT, SIMPLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. HOWEVER, IN CONNECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS FACED THE ISSUE OF HOW TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND PROTECT THE POPULATION FROM ACUTE INFECTIOUS DISEASES.
565	OBJECTIVE WHILE THE AIM OF COVID-19 POLICIES IS TO SUPPRESS THE PANDEMIC, MANY FEAR THAT THE BURDEN OF THE RESTRICTIONS WILL FALL MORE HEAVILY ON LESS PRIVILEGED GROUPS. WE SHOW ONE POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR COVID-19 RESPONSES TO INCREASE INEQUALITY BY EXAMINING THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS AND BUSINESS POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. METHODS WE FIELDED AN ONLINE SURVEY OF 2735 BUSINESS EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS IN UKRAINE, EGYPT, AND VENEZUELA OVER THE SUMMER OF 2020 TO COLLECT DATA ON COMPANIES' CLOSURES DUE TO COVID-19 AND NUANCED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR POLITICAL CONNECTIONS. FINDINGS WE SHOW THAT BUSINESSES WITH POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO SHUT DOWN AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 POLICIES. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT MEASURES DESIGNED TO MITIGATE COVID-19 ARE INEFFECTIVE IN COUNTRIES WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW IF POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS ARE ABLE TO CIRCUMVENT RESTRICTIONS BY LEVERAGING POLITICAL CONNECTIONS TO RECEIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, POLITICALLY CONNECTED FIRMS ARE NO MORE LIKELY-AND SOMETIMES EVEN LESS LIKELY-TO ENGAGE IN SOCIAL-DISTANCING POLICIES TO MITIGATE THE PANDEMIC DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN OPEN.
566	THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF MILITARISATION, GOVERNANCE, AND DEMOCRACY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) FOR THE PERIOD 2002 TO 2018. THE STUDY EMPLOYED THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE FIXED EFFECTS MODEL TO ACCOUNT FOR SIMULTANEITY/REVERSE CAUSALITY, AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC UNOBSERVABLE HETEROGENEITY AS WELL AS THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE QUANTILE REGRESSION WITH FIXED EFFECTS TO ACCOUNT FOR EXISTING LEVELS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SSA. BASED ON THE FIXED EFFECTS RESULTS, IT IS REVEALED THAT MILITARISATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION IN THE REGION, WHILE GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRACY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS. RESULTS FROM THE QUANTILE REGRESSION SHOW THAT (1) THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF MILITARISATION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS OBSERVABLE ACROSS ALL QUANTILES, (2) THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE EXISTING LEVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS HIGH, WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW EXERTS STRONGER IMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE EXISTING LEVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE LOWER, (3) THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF DEMOCRACY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE EXISTING LEVEL OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS HIGH. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THESE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED.
567	THE STUDY PROVIDES THRESHOLDS OF INCOME INEQUALITY THAT IF EXCEEDED WILL NULLIFY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ON GENDER-INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN 42 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FOR THE PERIOD 2004-2014. THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS USED AS AN ESTIMATION STRATEGY. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, THE UNCONDITIONAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ON INCLUSIVE EDUCATION ARE CONSISTENTLY POSITIVE WHEREAS THE CORRESPONDING CONDITIONAL EFFECTS FROM THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INEQUALITY AND GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ARE CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE. SECOND, THE LEVELS OF INEQUALITY THAT COMPLETELY CROWD-OUT THE POSITIVE INCIDENCE OF GOVERNANCE ON INCLUSIVE 'PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION' ARE: 0.587 FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND 0.565 FOR CORRUPTION-CONTROL. THIRD, THE LEVELS OF INEQUALITY THAT COMPLETELY DAMPEN THE POSITIVE INCIDENCE OF GOVERNANCE ON INCLUSIVE 'SECONDARY EDUCATION' ARE: 0.601 FOR 'VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY' AND 0.700 FOR REGULATION QUALITY. FOURTH, FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, INEQUALITY THRESHOLDS ARE RESPECTIVELY 0.568 FOR POLITICAL STABILITY AND 0.562 FOR CORRUPTION-CONTROL. THE MAIN POLICY IMPLICATION IS THAT FOR GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS TO PROMOTE INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN THE SAMPLED COUNTRIES, INCOME INEQUALITY LEVELS SHOULD BE KEPT WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. OTHER IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.
568	SINCE THE 1990S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PROCESS OF MANAGERIALIZATION. THE MANAGERIALIZATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE MAY RESULT IN FUNDAMENTAL TENSIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS OF VALUES: EFFICIENCY AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST VALUES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW OR CAREFUL DECISION-MAKING. THIS ARTICLE CONCENTRATES ON ONE EXAMPLE OF THE MANAGERIALIZATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE: THE POLICY PROGRAMME ASAP (AS SOON AS POSSIBLE) IN THE NETHERLANDS, AIMED AT MAKING THE SETTLEMENT OF CASES OF HIGH-VOLUME PETTY CRIME BOTH FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT. THE INTRODUCTION OF ASAP HAS RESULTED IN A STRONG STANDARDIZATION OF WORK PROCESSES AND STRICT TIME LIMITS, FOR BOTH THE POLICE AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE. IN THIS ARTICLE WE ANALYSE HOW ASAP OPERATES IN PRACTICE AND TO WHAT DEGREE THE POLICY GOALS OF ASAP ARE REALIZED. THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF ASAP HAS TRANSFORMED AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DUTCH CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INTO AN ASSEMBLY OR PRODUCTION LINE. THIS EXAMPLE OF THE MANAGERIALIZATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE HAS RESULTED IN IMPORTANT TENSIONS BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, MANAGERIAL VALUES AND, ON THE OTHER, THE VALUES OF OCCUPATIONAL (LEGAL) PROFESSIONALISM.
569	ONE OF THE PRIORITY VALUES OF THE MODERN LEGAL SYSTEMS IS THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, I.E. LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY WRONGFUL ACTS DIRECTED AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES, AS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN THEIR LEGAL SYSTEM. DIRECTIVE 2004/35/EC AND DIRECTIVE 2008/99/EC ESTABLISH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY SYSTEMS OF EU MEMBER STATES. THE FIRST DIRECTIVE 2004/35/EC DOES NOT DEAL WITH CIVIL LIABILITY WITH REGARD TO THE PREVENTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. DIRECTIVE 2008/99/EC ON THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH CRIMINAL LAW LAYS DOWN THE PRINCIPLES TO BE FOLLOWED BY MEMBER STATES IN THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMINAL LAW. ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED AS A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE 'RULE OF LAW' SYSTEMS AS ONE OF THE COMMON VALUES UPON WHICH THE UNION IS FOUNDED. THE DIRECTIVE 2008/99/EC SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF FIGHT AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME. IT MAY BE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR EU MEMBERS STATES AND CANDIDATE COUNTRIES TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARDS SET OUT IN THE EU ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTIVES.
570	THROUGHOUT THE 1980S, BRAZILIAN SOCIETY CAME TO REVIVE A SERIES OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A POLITICAL SHIFT IN THE TRANSITION OF THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE CAMPAIGNS FOR AN ANISTIA AMPLA, GERAL E IRRESTRITA AND DIRETAS JA! ARE EXAMPLES OF SUCH POLITICAL MOBILIZATION WITH POPULAR PARTICIPATION. THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INSTALLATION OF A NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY (ANC) AS A PROJECT OF SOCIAL NEGOTIATION, AND THE SEARCH FOR CONSENSUSES BETWEEN POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING MEMORIES IN THE AIM OF PREVENTING CONFLICTS THAT WOULD THREATEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY. IN THE PERIOD OF FEBRUARY 1, 1987 TO 5 OCTOBER, 1988, THE BUILDING OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS SERVED AS A STAGE FOR THE ORGANIZING OF A NEW CONSTITUTION. ALTHOUGH THIS PROVIDED A SYMBOL FOR THE NEW ERA, IT CARRIED - AND CONTINUES TO CARRY - TRACES OF THE PREVIOUS HISTORICAL PERIOD IT AIMED TO BREAK WITH. CONSIDERING THE 30-YEAR ANNIVERSARY IN 2018 OF THE ANC'S INAUGURATION AND THE PROMULGATION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION ITSELF (1988), THE SUBJECT BECOMES EVEN MORE PERTINENT IN LIGHT OF THESE SIGNIFICANT DATES AND THE SOCIALLY-CONSTRUCTED MEMORIES.
571	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DEAL WITH THE RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE BRAZILIAN LAW, SINCE ITS INCEPTION, ITS LEGISLATIVE CHANGES REACHING ITS CURRENT CHARACTERIZATION IN THE NEW FOREST CODE (LAW 12.651/2012). THE CURRENT LEGISLATION CAME FROM MANY DISCUSSIONS OF RURALISTS, ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND SCIENTISTS BRINGING INNUMERABLE INNOVATIONS, AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR APPLICABILITY, CONSIDERING LEGAL CERTAINTY. LEGAL SECURITY IS AN INSTITUTE EVIDENCED IN THE RULE OF LAW, AIMS TO PROTECT THE HYPOSUFFICIENT, AVOIDING ABUSES OR INSECURITIES. IT WILL BE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND ITS APPLICABILITY IN RELATION TO THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OF THE PERCENTAGES OF LEGAL RESERVE, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE LEGISLATION AT THE TIME. IN ADDITION, ENVIRONMENTAL LAW HAS ITS PECULIARITIES, ADOPTING THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS FRAGILE (HYPOSUFFICIENT) AND SHOULD BE PROTECTED ALWAYS AGAINST THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE STATE, THE COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUALS, PROJECTING EVEN A POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES, IN THE CASE OF STATUTORY RESERVE PERCENTAGES, TO ACHIEVE PAST EVENTS AS REGARDS THE GUARANTEE OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO AN ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT. FOR THIS RESEARCH THE EXPLORATORY RESEARCH METHOD WAS USED WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DOCUMENTARY PROCEDURES.
572	PEACEBUILDING COUNTRIES ARE CONCENTRATED IN AREAS OF HEIGHTENED VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, AND ALMOST CERTAINLY LACK THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE THESE IMPACTS. IN SPITE OF THIS OVERLAP, CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION PROJECTS ARE TYPICALLY EXCLUDED FROM PEACEBUILDING ACTIVITIES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY ALARMING GIVEN THAT MANY ANALYSTS BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL TRIGGER, AMPLIFY OR PERPETUATE HUMANITARIAN CRISES, POPULATION DISPLACEMENT, POLITICAL EXTREMISM AND VIOLENT CONFLICT IN THE REGIONS IN WHICH MOST PEACEBUILDING OPERATIONS TAKE PLACE. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEGRATING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO PEACEBUILDING. IT IDENTIFIES THREE OBSTACLES TO THIS INTEGRATION-THE LACK OF CLIMATE CHANGE TOOLS AND POLICIES THAT CAN BE EASILY INTRODUCED INTO TYPICAL PEACEBUILDING PROGRAMMING; THE SKEPTICISM AND COMPLACENCY OF THE DONOR COMMUNITY; AND TENSIONS BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVES AND TIMEFRAMES OF PEACEBUILDING AND THOSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE. THE PAPER THEN EXAMINES OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE CLIMATE CHANGE INTO FOUR PRINCIPAL PROGRAMMATIC AREAS OF PEACEBUILDING-SOCIO-ECONOMIC RECOVERY, POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE, SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS-AND CONCLUDES THAT MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO BUILD RESILIENCE AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE DAUNTING AND COSTLY CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE.
573	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) IN LIGHT OF ITS POTENTIAL FOR CREATING AND INSTITUTIONALIZING JUSTICE NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY. THE THEORETICAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IS BASED ON THE ENGLISH SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND ITS CENTRAL CONFLICT BETWEEN ORDER AND JUSTICE. THE FRAMEWORK INTEGRATES A CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH AND THE 'NORM LIFE-CYCLE' TO EXPLAIN THE DYNAMIC PROCESS OF NORM EMERGENCE AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION IN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY. I ARGUE THAT ESTABLISHING THE ICTY, DESPITE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE WAY IT WAS SET UP, CONSTITUTED AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENT FOR MULTILATERAL ACTION TOWARDS INSTITUTIONALIZING RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND PRINCIPLES OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THESE NORMS ARE BEING TAKEN INCREASINGLY SERIOUSLY AND ARE BEING GIVEN PRIORITY OVER OTHER FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ORDER, SUCH AS SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-INTERVENTION. THE ICTY'S ESTABLISHMENT CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND LAW AND IS EVIDENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY'S MOVE TOWARDS INCREASED NORM INTERNATIONALIZATION. THE ICTY ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AND THE FURTHER INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS IN CREATING A MORE JUST ORDER.
574	THE ESSAY SHOWS THAT FORMAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE REICHSTAGSBRANDVERORDNUNG AND THE WEIMAR REPUBLICS STATE-OF-EMERGENCY ACTS ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IS GENERALLY THOUGHT. FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS AND THE LANGUAGE EMPLOYED IN THE REICHSTAGSBRANDVERORDNUNG CAN BE SEEN TO BE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH A PROVISIONAL ORDINANCE THAT WAS DRAWN UP IN 1919 TO REGULATE A STATE-OF-EMERGENCY. IDENTICAL TO TEXTS OF OLDER DECREES IS IN PARTICULAR THE SUSPENSION OF BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS. EVEN THE FORM TAKEN BY A CIVIL STATE-OF-EMERGENCY, DURING THE SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS EVOKED BETWEEN 1920 AND 1921, WAS NOT NEW IN PRINCIPLE. IN 1933, HOWEVER, THE FIRST NATIONWIDE CIVIL EMERGENCY ACT WAS DECREED AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE REICH GOVERNMENT WAS EMPOWERED TO EXERCISE DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER ALL GERMAN FEDERAL STATES. WITH ONLY A FEW CHANGES IN THE EXISTING STATE-OF-EMERGENCY PROVISIONS, IT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER FOR THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS TO FIND A PSEUDO-LEGAL BASIS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF A STATE UNDER RULE OF LAW. HENCE, THE QUESTION ARISES TO WHAT EXTENT THE CREATION OF FAR-REACHING STATE-OF-EMERGENCY PROVISIONS DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC WAS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE.
575	THIS WORK IDENTIFIES A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE IT IS NEVER INDIFFERENT OR STATIC IN RELATION TO THE POLITICAL REGIME, WHICH ALSO JUSTIFIES STUDYING IT UNDER A CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH. HOWEVER, EVEN AFTER THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION OF 1988, BRAZIL PERSISTS IN SUFFERING FROM AUTHORITARIAN PERMANENCIES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THIS STUDY IS CONCERNED WITH OVERCOMING THIS AUTHORITARIANIS WHICH IS PART OF A BROADER CONTEXT, THE LATIN AMERICAN ONE. THE COUNTRIES IN THIS REGION HAVE A COMMON PAST -EXPLOITATIVE COLONIALISM, HUMAN ENSLAVEMENT AND VIOLENT CIVIL-MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS -WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OVERCOME, DESPITE ALL HAVING THEORETICAL TOOLS AND FORMAL INSTITUTIONS TO DO SO. THE NEED TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY AND MAKING GUARANTEES EFFECTIVE REQUIRES EVALUATING PROPOSALS CAPABLE OF INTERFERING WITH THE AUTHORITARIAN REALITY OF THE BRAZILIAN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO CHANGE IT, ADAPTING IT TO THE DEMOCRATIC ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE, THE THEORETICAL PROJECT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN IUS COMMUNE ARE INVESTIGATED HEREIN, WHICH, AWARE OF THE WEAKNESS OF INSTITUTIONS ON THE CONTINENT, SEEKS TO DEVELOP DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH CONSTITUTIONALISM WHICH INTERRELATES INTERNAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ONES OF THE INTER -AMERICAN SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
576	THE RESEARCH AIMS TO CARRY OUT A CRITICAL AND DOGMATIC EXAMINATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOCTRINAL AND AXIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF CRIMINAL SENTENCES, IN THE ERA OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION, THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW AND THE USE OF CONSTITUTIONAL HERMENEUTICS IN JUDICIAL REASONING. THE RESEARCH WAS OF A DESCRIPTIVE NATURE. THE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM UNDER STUDY HAS BEEN BASED ON THE THEORY OF CRIMINAL LAW THAT SEEKS TO RESTRICT THE VIOLENCE INHERENT IN THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM, IN ORDER TO LIMIT ITS INTERVENTION TO THE MANIFEST FUNCTIONS OF THE PENALTY ESTABLISHED IN ARTICLE IX OF THE PRELIMINARY TITLE: PREVENTIVE, PROTECTIVE AND RESOCIALIZING, WHICH THE PERUVIAN STATE ASSIGNS TO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT, WITHIN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, BASED ON NEO-CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE AND THE PARADIGM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. DIGNITY IS THE ONTOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE PERSON THAT DISTINGUISHES HIM AS A SUPERIOR RATIONAL BEING, FREE, AWARE OF HIMSELF, HIS FINITENESS AND HIS GREATNESS, CAPABLE OF VALUING, CHOOSING, DECIDING AND THEREFORE ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS ACTS, AFFIRMING THAT HE IS THE ONLY BEING THAT IS PRICELESS BECAUSE HE HAS NO EQUIVALENT.
577	DOES THE EU KNOW WHAT FUTURE THEY WANT? AND DOES THE EU KNOW WHAT FORM OF FUTURE INTEGRATION PROCESS IS THE RIGHT, APPROPRIATE OR, AT LEAST, REALISTIC ONE? DURING THE LAST DECADE, THE EU HAD BEEN WEATHERING A NUMBER OF CRISES, IN PARTICULAR, THE EURO-CRISIS, THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS. AND OTHER CRISES FOLLOWED OR ARE FOLLOWING: BREXIT AS AN INTERNAL SHOCK WHICH OUTLINED THE DEBATE ON THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE EU, COVID-19 AS AN EXTERNAL HEALTH SHOCK THAT STARTED A PROCESS OF INTERNAL REFORM OF THE EU IN TERMS OF THE POLICIES APPLIED. RUSSIA'S ATTACK ON UKRAINE AS AN EXTERNAL SECURITY SHOCK, WHICH FOLLOWS AND REINFORCES THE EU'S REFORMIST TENDENCIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF BUILDING INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY. IT IS MORE THAN TIMELY, NECESSARY AND INDISPENSABLE TO ASK AND QUESTION POLITICAL LEADERS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE EU AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE EU SHOULD AND COULD MOVE FORWARD. IT MUST NOT REMAIN BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS OF BRUSSELS INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT CABINETS, BUT BECOME A SHARED PROJECT WITH A VISION.
578	WE EXAMINE THE DETERMINANTS OF MFIS' SOCIAL RATING DECISIONS ACCORDING TO INSTITUTIONAL AND RESOURCE DEPENDENCY PRESSURE FACTORS. WE EXPLOIT A UNIQUE DATA SET CONTAINING 221 MFIS RESULTING IN 767-YEAR OBSERVATIONS, OBTAINED FROM BOTH MIXED MARKET AND SOCIAL RATING AGENCIES (PLANET, MICROFINANZA, AND MICRORATE RATING AGENCIES). OUR DATA WAS COLLECTED FOR BOTH RATED AND NON-RATED MFIS BETWEEN THE YEARS 2006 AND 2018, IN SIX MAJOR LESS-DEVELOPED REGIONS OF THE WORLD. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE CSR LITERATURE IN MICROFINANCE AS THE DECISION TO BE RATED ACTS LIKE A CSR SIGNAL. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE TIGHTER THE RULE OF LAW THE LESS INCLINED MFIS ARE TO SEEK A RATING. IN ADDITION, WE BORROW FROM THE RESOURCE-DEPENDENCE PERSPECTIVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT PROXIES FOR RESOURCE (IN)DEPENDENCE SUCH AS FOR-PROFIT STATUS, MATURE STAGE, AND SUBSIDIZATION ARE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBTENTION OF A SOCIAL RATING. OVERALL, IN THE LESS-DEVELOPED REGIONS OF THE WORLD, WHEN MFIS OPERATE IN A STRONGLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE A STRONG POSITION (FINANCIAL AND MISSION-WISE), WITH RESPECT TO INVESTORS, THEY ARE LESS WILLING TO OBTAIN A SOCIAL RATING.
579	IN AN INTERNATIONAL SETTING OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, APPLYING ADVANCED STATISTICAL ESTIMATION APPROACHES SUCH AS THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM), TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARE (2SLS) REGRESSIONS, AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER REVISITS THE IMPACT OF MACRO-LEVEL GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND THE CORRUPTION INDEX ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE. WE USE CROSS-COUNTRY PANEL DATA FOR 40 SUB-SAHARAN AND THE MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN (MENA) COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD OF 2009-2020. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS DOCUMENT THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE INDEX AND THE CORRUPTION INDEX ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND POPULATION HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE AND TRADE OPENNESS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT. THE STUDY EVALUATES THE ROBUSTNESS OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS THROUGH A SERIES OF TESTS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS AND REGULATORS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN AND IMPROVING COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE QUALITY THAT COULD ENCOURAGE INCREASED FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR AN ACCELERATED ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE. THESE WILL FURTHER ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, THE RULE OF LAW, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, THE PUBLIC VOICE, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS.
580	OUR EXAMINATION OF 796 CHINESE FIRMS THAT INVESTED IN THE BELT&ROAD (B&R) REGION FROM 2008 TO 2015 SHOWS THAT CHINESE FIRMS OFTEN ENCOUNTER LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS (LOF) AND LIABILITY OF ORIGIN (LOR). OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT LARGER INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE IS RELATED TO SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE DECREASE, WHICH EVIDENCES LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS FOR CHINESE MULTINATIONALS. MOREOVER, CHINESE FIRMS WITH CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP SEE THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AFTER THE B&R INITIATIVE, WHICH FURTHER VALIDATES THE ARGUMENT FOR LIABILITY OF ORIGIN. WE FOUND THAT FIRMS' CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE (CSR) HAS A SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE "INSTITUTIONAL MODERATING" EFFECT, THAT IS BUFFERING CONFLICTS BETWEEN CHINESE FIRMS AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, AND PROJECTING A FAVORABLE INSTITUTIONAL IMAGE TO MITIGATE CHINESE MULTINATIONALS' DUAL LIABILITIES IN THE B&R REGION. FIRMS WITH BETTER CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) PERFORMANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO AVOID POLITICAL RISK. CSR HAS BEEN A BUFFERING AND BRIDGE MECHANISM IN GOVERNMENT INEFFICIENCY, LOWER REGULATORY QUALITY, LOWER RULE OF LAW AND LESS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND REDUCING RENT SEEKING BEHAVIOR.THEREFORE, INVESTMENT IN CSR AND MORE INCLUSIVE OWNERSHIP SCHEMES MAY ASSIST CHINESE FIRMS' LONG SURVIVAL ACROSS THE B&R REGION.
581	CURRENT CRITICAL GOVERNANCE TRENDS RAISE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS FOR SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD OF INTEGRITY POLICIES. CURRENTLY, SCHOLARS AGREE THAT GOVERNANCE TRENDS SHOW DECLINING TRENDS IN THE FIELDS OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, JUSTICE, RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, POLITICIZATION, PROTECTION OF PRIVACY, EQUALITY, AND FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. THESE TRENDS EXIST IN MANY COUNTRIES, ALBEIT TO A DIFFERENT DEGREE. ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE CAN ALSO OBSERVE AN EXPANSION OF INTEGRITY POLICIES. IN THE FIELD OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (COI), FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, COI-POLICIES HAVE BECOME EVER MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND SOPHISTICATED. COUNTRIES IMPLEMENT EVER MORE POLICIES, INTRODUCE STRICTER STANDARDS AND INVEST MORE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COI POLICIES. COL POLICIES BECOME MORE COMPLEX AND THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF COI POLICIES MORE PROFESSIONAL. IN VIEW OF THESE SEEMINGLY PARADOXICAL TRENDS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE CRITICAL GOVERNANCE TRENDS AND INTEGRITY POLICIES. WE DISCUSS THE CASE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICIES FOR MINISTERS/SECRETARIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT TRENDS TOWARD CRITICAL GOVERNANCE FIT WITH THE EXPANSION OF INTEGRITY POLICIES FOR VARIOUS REASONS, BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE (INCREASINGLY) USED AS USEFUL POLITICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR VARIOUS POLITICAL INTERESTS.
582	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE RESPONSE OF FRENCH STREET THEATRE TO FRANCE'S STATE OF EMERGENCY (2015-217). IT ANALYSES THE EMERGENCY (AND THE BROADER STATE OF EXCEPTION) AS A RECONFIGURATION OF SPACE AND TIME THAT HAS ALTERED THE CONDITIONS FROM WHICH STREET THEATRE MIGHT CLAIM SPACE AS PUBLIC. SINCE THE 2015 PARIS TERROR ATTACKS AND THE ENSUING DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY, HOW HAS STREET THEATRE ATTEMPTED TO CREATE SPACES OF POSSIBILITY AND IMAGINE ALTERNATIVE FUTURES IN A RESTRICTED PUBLIC SPHERE? I EXAMINE HOW THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AFFECTED THE AURILLAC FESTIVAL, FRANCE'S LARGEST ANNUAL STREET THEATRE FESTIVAL, IN 2016 AND 2017. THE RESPONSE OF STREET THEATRE PRACTITIONERS AND FESTIVALGOERS TO HEIGHTENED SECURITY MEASURES IN 2016 REVEALS A TENSION BETWEEN ORDER AND DISORDER AND A POTENTIALLY INESCAPABLE BIND: STREET THEATRE'S ADVOCATES APPEAL TO A RULE OF LAW THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SUSPENDED AND TO A LIBERAL, UNIVERSALIST CONCEPTION OF PUBLIC SPACE THAT, IN FRANCE AT LEAST, HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRUCTURED BY THE LOGIC OF THE EXCEPTION. BUT ANALYSIS OF AURILLAC 2017 SHOWS HOW, IN PERFORMANCE, STREET THEATRE MIGHT RE-FORM THE PRECARITY OF BODIES IN A STATE OF EXCEPTION AND MODEL THE FORMATION OF AN INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC.
583	OBJECTIVITY IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TENETS OF MODERN LEGAL SYSTEMS, ALL THE MORE SO WHEN IT COMES TO STRUCTURING LAW AT THE LEVEL OF JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE, WE DECONSTRUCT THE NOTION OF OBJECTIVITY AND, EVEN MORE SO ITS OPPOSITE - SUBJECTIVITY. THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LITERATURE, WE PRESENT VARIOUS THEORIES AND CONCEPTS ABOUT JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING: FROM LEGAL FORMALISM TO ATTITUDINALISM AND MOTIVATED COGNITION AND MOTIVATED REASONING. USING WHITEHEAD'S TYPOLOGY, WE EXAMINE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF JUDGES ACCORDING TO THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW, AND DETERMINE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THEIR JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. AFTER CONCEPTUALIZING IDEAS AND THEORIES, AND DECONSTRUCTING THE NOTION OF OBJECTIVITY, WE EXPLORE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER EVERY SUBJECTIVITY IS NECESSARILY DETRIMENTAL IN JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. IN CASES WHERE OUR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS NEGATIVE, WE SET CRITERIA BY WHICH WE CAN DISTINGUISH THEM FROM CASES OF HARMFUL SUBJECTIVITY. AT THE HEART OF THE CONCEPT AROUND WHICH WE BASE OUR THESIS LIE VALUES; ON ONE HAND, THE VALUES THAT DRIVE THE JUDGE'S INDIVIDUAL DECISION, WHILE ON THE OTHER, THE VALUES UPON WHICH THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS SET.
584	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ANTECEDENTS OF THE 'BRITISH VALUES' (DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE RIGHTS OF ALL MEN AND WOMEN TO LIVE FREE FROM PERSECUTION) WHICH IT IS INCUMBENT UPON BRITISH SCHOOLS TO TEACH. BUT IT ALSO SEEKS TO MOVE THE DEBATE FORWARD BY POINTING TO THE 'BRITISH VIRTUES' WITHOUT WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE BY 'BRITISH VALUES'. THE ARGUMENT ADVANCED HERE IS THAT THE INCULCATION OF VIRTUES (MORAL HABITS AND DISPOSITIONS UNDERPINNING GOOD CHARACTER) AS WELL AS VALUES (BELIEFS AND IDEALS) IS FOUNDATIONAL IN SCHOOLING FOR LIFE IN A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. ON THE VIEW THAT SCHOOLS ARE BOTH 'BY' AND 'FOR' SOCIETY (BEING THE PRODUCTS OF THE SOCIETY THEY SEEK TO SERVE) THE ARTICLE PROBLEMATISES ATTEMPTS TO CONCEIVE OF SCHOOLING IN GENERAL, AND CHARACTER EDUCATION IN PARTICULAR, IN EXCLUSIVELY POST-CHRISTIAN TERMS. ALTHOUGH INCREASINGLY SECULAR, AS BRITISH CULTURE IS NOT QUITE THE PALIMPSEST THAT EASILY PERMITS A MILLENNIUM OF CHRISTIAN SOCIAL AND LEGAL 'WRITING' TO BE 'OVER-WRITTEN', SOME OF ITS CENTRAL CONCEPTS ARE DRAWN UPON IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE HERE FOR THE CURRICULUM AND GOVERNANCE OF SCHOOLS.
585	SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) IN KOSOVO REMAINS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. THE EXISTING APPROACH IS HEAVILY DRIVEN BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: WHAT ROLE IS PLAYED BY LOCAL RESEARCH IN KOSOVO'S SSR? THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE CHALLENGES THAT LOCAL RESEARCH POSES TO INTERNATIONALLY LED SSR IN KOSOVO, AND THE CONTRIBUTION THAT LOCAL RESEARCHERS MAKE TO THE DECISION-MAKING OF INTERNATIONAL PRACTITIONERS. IN KOSOVO, LOCAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS PRODUCE RESEARCH ANALYSING AND CRITIQUING INTERNATIONAL SSR AND OFFERING ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES. THE STUDY BUILDS ON EXISTING STUDIES OF EPISTEMIC COMMUNITIES AND RESEARCH USE IN POLICY-MAKING AND NEW EVIDENCE BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S INTERVIEW SURVEY OF RESEARCHERS AND POLICY-MAKERS IN KOSOVO. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT FOCUSING ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LOCAL RESEARCHERS AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY PRACTITIONERS PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF KOSOVO'S SSR. THE STUDY DECONSTRUCTS THE STRUCTURES, PROCESSES AND AGENCIES AT THE HEART OF THE LOCAL/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIP. IT EXPLAINS HOW LOCAL RESEARCH ON TOPICS OF SECURITY, JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW, AND ITS INTERACTION WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTITIONERS, CHALLENGES INTERNATIONAL SSR AND CONTRIBUTES TO INTERNATIONAL SSR DECISION-MAKING.
586	A WELL-DEVELOPED SET OF INTERNATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION TOOLS NOW EXISTS. THESE RANGE FROM BROAD CONVENTIONS TO FOCUSED INITIATIVES IN SPECIFIC POLICY AREAS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS WORK BEST WHEN THEY ARE FOCUSED AND THEY SPEAK TO THE COMMON INTERESTS OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. SOLUTIONS NEED TO BE CREATIVE, THEY NEED TO BRING IN A BROAD COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND THEY NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS NEED TO HELP STATES WITH GOOD QUALITY INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES, ACCOUNTABILITY DRIVES AND NUANCED EFFORTS TO TACKLE PARTICULAR NATIONAL VARIANTS OF "LEGAL CORRUPTION." IN COUNTRIES WITH PATCHY INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE THE SCOPE FOR INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE IS BROADER, WHILE IN STATES WITH SERIOUS GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES THE BEST INTERNATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS WILL OFTEN HAVE SURPRISINGLY LITTLE TO DO WITH CORRUPTION AT ALL. IN A STATE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS PATCHY OR NON-EXISTENT THEN ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS (OR INDEED LAWS MORE GENERALLY) MEAN VERY LITTLE. THE CHALLENGE HERE IS TO IMPROVE THE BASIC TOOLS OF GOVERNANCE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY THEN CAN THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION BE BROUGHT ON TO THE AGENDA.
587	IN 1994, A WAVE OF PROFESSIONALIZATION BEGAN TO SWEEP OVER CHINESE FOOTBALL, BEGINNING A NEW CHAPTER IN CHINA'S SPORTING DEVELOPMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GRATIFYING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE PAST 23 YEARS; MEANWHILE, SOME PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED. THE MOST PROMINENT ARE FOOTBALL FRAUD, UNFAIR REFEREEING AND CORRUPTION, AND AS SUCH THE REGULATION OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY PRESSING ISSUE. THROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW AND LOGICAL ANALYSIS, THIS RESEARCH STARTS WITH A DISCUSSION OF FOOTBALL FRAUD, UNFAIR REFEREEING, AND CORRUPTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE FOOTBALL PROFESSIONALIZATION, THEN ANALYZES THE CAUSES OF THESE PROBLEMS, AND FINALLY PUTS FORWARD SOME MEASURES FOR THE FUTURE REGULATION CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, THROUGH LEARNING FROM THE LESSONS OF SOME DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IT IS BELIEVED THAT ESTABLISHING SOUND RULES AND REGULATIONS AND INDEPENDENT SPORTS ARBITRATION ORGANIZATIONS, TAKING STRICT SCRUTINY AND SEVERE PUNISHMENT MEASURES, IMPROVING ACCURACY AND AUTHORITY IN FOOTBALL RULINGS, AS WELL AS CULTIVATING AND REINFORCING AWARENESS OF RULE OF LAW, ARE THE WAY FORWARD FOR CHINESE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL. THIS RESEARCH ALSO MAPS OUT A VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF CHINESE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL: NON-POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS, SYSTEMATIC FOOTBALL LEGISLATION, INDEPENDENT SUPERVISORY ORGANIZATIONS, AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONERS.
588	DEVELOPED SOCIETIES GENERATE A MULTITUDE OF CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN THEIR MEMBERS, WHICH NEED TO BE RESOLVED FAIRLY IF SOCIETY IS TO FUNCTION WELL. JUDICIAL OFFICERS PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THAT PROCESS BY HEARING AND DETERMINING DISPUTES ACCORDING TO LAW, BUT THEY ARE COSTLY AND THEIR LONG TENURE ENTRENCHES LABOUR MARKET RIGIDITIES. THIS IS AN INCONVENIENCE FOR MODERN GOVERNMENTS, AS THEY ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE TURNING, WHILE FACING BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS THAT DRIVE THEM TO SEEK EVER GREATER COST-EFFICIENCIES. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS THE WAYS IN WHICH GOVERNMENTS IN AUSTRALIA HAVE SOUGHT TO OPTIMISE THE JUDICIAL LABOUR FORCE BY CREATING A MORE FLEXIBLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SUPPLY. THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THAT HAS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS IS A COMPLEX ONE, WITH MANY COMPLEMENTARY PARTS. THERE IS NO UNIQUE SOLUTION TO THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY JUDICIAL OFFICERS SOCIETY NEEDS TO QUELL DISPUTES BECAUSE THIS GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. BUT GREAT CARE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT ACTION TO FIND FLEXIBLE SOURCES OF LABOUR TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR JUDICIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION DOES NOT COME AT TOO HIGH A PRICE IN TERMS OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
589	WHEN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION'S NEW DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MACHINERY WAS CREATED IN 1995, NO ONE KNEW FOR CERTAIN WHAT ITS CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE. INNOVATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL IN CRUCIAL RESPECTS, IT REPRESENTED AN EXTRAORDINARY GAMBIT BY THE URUGUAY ROUND NEGOTIATORS, WHO AGREED TO ITS CREATION PARTLY OUT OF FRUSTRATION WITH THE PERCEIVED DEFICITS OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT OF TARIFF AND TRADE'S ENFORCEMENT MACHINERY, PARTLY OUT OF FEAR OF UNILATERALISM AND PARTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A PARTICULAR MOMENT OF POST-COLD WAR FAITH IN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH A MYTHOLOGY VERY QUICKLY EMERGED AROUND THIS NEW DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MACHINERY, ACCORDING TO WHICH IT REPRESENTED A STEP-CHANGE FROM POWER-ORIENTED TO RULE-ORIENTED TRADE DIPLOMACY, THIS WAS IN TRUTH ALWAYS MORE OF AN ASPIRATIONAL EXPRESSION RATHER THAN A STATEMENT OF FACT. IN THE MID-1990S, THE NEW SYSTEM HAD MANY POSSIBLE FUTURES, AND ITS HISTORICAL MEANING WAS YET TO BE MADE. NO ONE WAS MORE CONSCIOUS OF THIS THAN THE SEVEN ORIGINAL MEMBERS OF THE APPELLATE BODY, WHO UNDERSTOOD WELL THE STAKES OF THEIR ENDEAVOUR AND FELT VERY KEENLY THE SCRUTINY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS IT WATCHED HOW THIS INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIMENT WOULD UNFOLD.
590	ANALOGICAL REASONING IS A PERVASIVE FEATURE OF THE COMMON LAW, YET ITS STRUCTURE AND RATIONAL FORCE IS MUCH DISPUTED BY LEGAL THEORISTS, SOME OF WHOM ARE SCEPTICAL THAT IT HAS ANY RATIONAL FORCE AT ALL. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PART OF THE EXPLANATION FOR THESE DISAGREEMENTS LIES IN THERE BEING NOT ONE FORM OF ANALOGICAL REASONING IN THE COMMON LAW, BUT THREE: CLASSIFICATORY ANALOGIES, CLOSE ANALOGIES AND DISTANT ANALOGIES. THESE THREE DIFFER IN THEIR FUNCTIONS AND RATIONALE. CLASSIFICATORY ANALOGIES INVOLVE THE USE OF DECIDED CASES TO HELP CHARACTERIZE NOVEL FACT SITUATIONS, AND ARE JUSTIFIED BY THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL OF MINIMIZING THE DEPENDENCE OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON THE INDIVIDUAL VIEWS OF DECISION-MAKERS. CLOSE ANALOGIES ARE USED TO HELP RESOLVE UNSETTLED ISSUES BY RELIANCE ON DECISIONS FROM OTHER BRANCHES OF THE SAME LEGAL DOCTRINE. THEY COMPLEMENT THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT, AND REST ON SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS. DISTANT ANALOGIES ARE ALSO USED TO HELP RESOLVE UNSETTLED ISSUES, BUT BY REFERENCE TO DECISIONS FROM OTHER LEGAL DOCTRINES. THEY ARE THE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO SCEPTICAL CRITIQUE: ALTHOUGH THEY CAN SERVE TO MAINTAIN COHERENCE IN THE LAW, THEY DESERVE A MORE MODEST ROLE IN LEGAL REASONING THAN THEY ARE OFTEN GIVEN.
591	THE SACRED IS A SOURCE OF LEGITIMACY FOR POLITICAL RULE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REMAINING ALWAYS BEYOND POLITICS AND LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THIS INTERSECTION AND INTERACTION OF RELIGION, POLITICS AND LAW AS A SEMANTIC FIELD, FOCUSING ON THE CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF PRACTICES. FIRST, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES AND CHALLENGES THE MYTH OF A PURELY SECULAR AND CONTRACTARIAN INTERNATIONAL ORDER, ALLEGEDLY CREATED BY THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA. SECOND, IT SHOWS HOW THIS CONTRACTARIAN METAPHOR GENERATED THE NOTION OF THE 'SACRALISATION OF THE PEOPLE' IN MODERNITY, AND IT WAS TRANSFIGURED INTO THE 'NATION' AS THE SOURCE OF LEGITIMACY FOR POLITICS AND LAW. THIRD, THE ARTICLE DEVELOPS A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE AND ON THE POTENTIAL OF IMPERIAL PROJECTS - OF A 'RULE OF LAWYERS' INSTEAD OF A RULE OF LAW. I ALSO ARGUE THAT 'RELIGIONS' DO NOT HAVE THE MONOPOLY FOR MILLENARIAN DERAILMENTS, SINCE EVEN 'SECULAR' PROJECTS, SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, HAVE THAT CRUSADING POTENTIAL. MODERN LAW CANNOT EFFECTIVELY DISPENSE WITH THE 'SACRED', AND PERHAPS EVEN WITH POLITICS, BY SUBSTITUTING ABSTRACT ENTITIES SUCH AS 'HUMAN RIGHTS' FOR IT. JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT (2013) 16, 1-24. DOI:10.1057/JIRD.2012.20
592	A RECONFIGURATION OF LAW IS TAKING PLACE IN THE CONTACT BETWEEN WESTERN AND MUSLIM LAW. WHILE MUSLIM LAW IS ITSELF A COMPLEX, PLURALISTIC AMALGAM OF DIFFERENT LEGAL 'BRICKS,' IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STRUGGLE FOR ISLAM TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A LEGITIMATE SOURCE OF VALUE PLURALISM IN THE WESTERN CONTEXT, THE RELIGIOUS ASPECTS OF MUSLIM LAW, WITH THEIR DOCTRINAL JUSTIFICATIONS, ARE BROUGHT INTO SHARPER RELIEF. THE ENGLISH CASE SHOWS THAT CUSTOMS AMONG MUSLIMS ARE SUPPRESSED IN THIS PROCESS OF 'SHARIATIZATION.' BEYOND THAT, EVEN MUSLIM DOCTRINES ARE BEING PLACED UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT IN VARIOUS WAYS. THESE CHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE MUSLIMS ARE LIVING AS NON-DOMINANT COMMUNITIES IN EUROPE, WHERE THEY ARE UNDER THE GAZE OF THE DOMINANT CULTURE AND SEEN AS POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL VIOLATORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. RELYING ON THE 'DYNAMIC OF RELIGION' AS THEORIZED BY BALAGANGADHARA ('THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS ...' ASIA, THE WEST, AND THE DYNAMIC OF RELIGION, 1994, LEIDEN, E. J. BRILL), THESE PROCESSES ARE SEEN AS OUTCOMES OF THE COLLISION BETWEEN TWO RELIGIOUS CULTURES, THE ISLAMIC AND THE WESTERN, AND THEY TELL US MORE ABOUT THE NATURE OF RELIGION ITSELF.
593	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POST-COLD WAR TENDENCY TO BROADEN THE COUNTERTERRORISM MANDATE TO INCLUDE OTHER PHENOMENA SUCH AS ORGANISED CRIME, DRUG-TRAFFICKING AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THIS REDEFINITION HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY, BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE AND AT THE LEVEL OF PRACTICE. AT THE LEVEL OF DISCOURSE, THE PLASTICITY OF THE WORD "TERRORISM" AND ITS APPLICATION TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PHENOMENA IS A FORM OF CLAIMS MAKING ACTIVITY BY A VARIETY OF AGENCIES FIGHTING FOR BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS IN AN ERA OF COST-CUTTING AND DEFICIT REDUCTION. AT THE LEVEL OF PRACTICE, THE COUNTER-TERRORISM MANDATE IS BEING EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE RANGE OF PHENOMENA COVERED IN THE WIDENING DISCOURSE AND THIS, IN TURN, HAS LED TO A BLURRING OF BOUNDARIES BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SECURITY, POLICE AND MILITARY MODELS OF CONTROL, AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. ALL THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE OPENNESS OF GOVERNMENT, THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF AGENCIES OF SOCIAL CONTROL, THE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND RELATED PHENOMENA, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF INFORMED CONSENT BY A PUBLIC MADE FEARFUL BY THE CLAIMS-MAKING DISCOURSE AS IT IS DISSEMINATED THROUGH THE MASS MEDIA.
594	THIS ARTICLE IS AN ESSAY ON THE PRODUCTION OF PUBLIC INSECURITY, THE YIELD THAT IT BRINGS AS PART OF A REGIME OF FEAR, AND ITS EFFECTS OF NORMALIZATION OF THE PRACTICES OF EXCEPTION IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK WITH THE YOUTH FROM THE SLUMS, TOGETHER WITH STATE AND LOCAL POLICE FROM THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO, AS WELL AS ON A SURVEY OF DOCUMENTARY AND JOURNALISTIC SOURCES ON THE INTERNET, FROM 2017 TO 2020. THE REFLECTIONS ARE GUIDED BY THE DISCUSSION OF THE PRODUCTION OF INSECURITY AS A PROJECT OF POWER. THE LOGIC OF "PROTECTION" TAKES THE PLACE OF SECURITY. THE RESULTS POINT TO THE MANUFACTURE OF DIFFUSE AND IMMEDIATE THREATS AS A RESOURCE FOR THE IMPOSITION OF A POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CONTROL AND SOCIAL REGULATION. THE HEALTH CRISIS HAS AGGRAVATED THE SECURITY CRISIS, KEEPING PEOPLE ON ALERT, WITH A FEELING OF URGENCY, LIVING THE IMMEDIATE. COLLECTIVE INSECURITY IS NOT NECESSARILY AN UNWANTED OUTCOME. IT HAS BEEN AN EXPECTED AND EFFECTIVE RESULT, A STRATEGIC MEANS THROUGH WHICH TO PRODUCE AND SUSTAIN A PROJECT OF EXCLUSIVE AND UNEQUAL POWER, FOR THE FEW.
595	INDIGENOUS CONSERVATION THROUGH PATRIMONIALIZATION IS THE PRODUCT OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL DECISIONS MADE BY A NON-INDIGENOUS AGENT: THE LIBERAL STATE, USING THE LAW TO RETAIN A FORM OF BIOS. WE PROPOSE THAT PATRIMONIALIZATION IS THE DEVICE BY WHICH LIBERAL STATES HAVE PROCESSED AND INTEGRATED INDIGENOUS CLAIMS INTO A FORM OF BIOS ULTIMATELY DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD STATE LEGAL STRUCTURES. WE ARGUE THAT, TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTEXTS OF STRUGGLE AND RESISTANCE THAT CHALLENGE THE VERY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW, STATES RESPOND BY WIELDING THE LAW IN THE FORM OF THE RULE BY LAW, THAT IS, PUSHING THE LAW TO THE LIMIT TO GIVE NORMATIVE CONTENT TO THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THE STATE CONDUCTS ITS AFFAIRS, WITHOUT STRAYING FROM THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FRAMEWORK. WE HOLD THAT THE RULE BY LAW IS AN OPERATION THAT DEFINES THE PATRIMONIALIZATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. IT INCREASES THEIR VISIBILITY WHILE IMPOSING LIMITS ON POLITICAL ACTION TO KEEP THEM FROM BECOMING SUI JURIS SUBJECTS CAPABLE OF BREACHING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ZOE AND BIOS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL-IDEOLOGICAL INTENT OF THESE DECISIONS, THE INTENTIONS BEYOND THE LETTER OF THE LAW OF PATRIMONIALIZED PEOPLES.
596	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF TRADE OPENNESS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) COUNTRIES FOCUSING ON THE ROLE PLAY BY DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENTS (GMM) IS CARRIED OUT ON 36 SSA COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2017. THE RESULTS OF OUR ESTIMATION REVEAL THAT DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS AS A COMPOSITE INDEX DETERMINES TRADE OPENNESS AS A COMPOSITE SHARE OF SQUALLI AND WILSON (2011). IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW WERE ALL ENHANCING ON TRADE OPENNESS. MOREOVER, ACCESS TO SEA, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, AND TRADE OPENNESS LAGGED BY ONE PERIOD ALL SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINE TRADE OPENNESS IN OUR ESTIMATIONS, WITH ALL THESE EFFECTS POSITIVE. WHEN TRADE SHARE WAS CONSIDERED AS A ROBUSTNESS CHECK, INFLATION AND POPULATION GROWTH WERE FURTHER FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY DETERMINE TRADE OPENNESS, WHEREAS GDP PER CAPITAL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY TRADE ENHANCING. THIS RESULT WAS ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES AND SENSITIVE TO THE CHOICES OF COUNTRIES AND SAMPLE PERIODS CONSIDERED. THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF STUDY ENGAGED THE DIFFERENT STATES OF SSA TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THEIR DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS IN ELABORATING THEIR INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICIES.
597	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE CHANGES THAT HAVE AFFECTED EUROPEAN BORDER REGIMES OF MIGRATION CONTROL AS A TEST CASE FOR DISCUSSING ARBITRARINESS. THE ARGUMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF NOTIONS OF ARBITRARINESS - DEFINED AS A DEPARTURE FROM THE RULE OF LAW - TO CAPTURE THE ONGOING CONFLICT AT THE BORDERS OF EUROPE AND INSTEAD BRINGS THE AMBIVALENT MEANING OF ARBITRARINESS TO THE FORE. BY COMPARING SANTI ROMANO'S CLASSICAL THEORY OF LEGAL PLURALISM WITH RECENT ANALYSES OF LEGAL GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES, ARBITRARINESS EMERGES EITHER AS AN AUTHORITATIVE ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A DIFFERENT ORDER ON SOCIETY OR AS A REACTION TO ACTS OF RESISTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, ARBITRARINESS FORCEFULLY BLURS THE LIMITS BETWEEN THE ORDERED AND UNORDERED, INDICATING THE PARADOXICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF EXCLUDING THE LAW'S OUTSIDE FROM THE LEGAL ORDER. ON THESE PREMISES, THE ARTICLE ADVOCATES THE IMPORTANCE OF REFRAMING THE DEMAND FOR OPEN BORDERS AS A CALL FOR FREEDOM OF THOSE WHO CHALLENGE THE PRAGMATIC ORDER OF MIGRATION REGIMES. INDEED, ARBITRARINESS IS NECESSARILY LIMITED WHEN THE LEGAL ORDER RECOGNIZES, TO AN EXTENT, THE AGENCY AND THE CLAIMS OF SUBJECTIVITIES THAT RESIST THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION.
598	BY ANALYZING HOW PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN A RULE-OF-LAW ORIENTED, CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM ADOPTED MANAGERIAL PRACTICES ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ACTUAL MANAGERIAL PRACTICES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. ITS MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION IS ABOUT WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN GERMANY DO WHEN THEY CLAIM TO HAVE IMPLEMENTED MANAGERIAL PRACTICES. FOR TEN MUNICIPALITIES WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS GOOD PRACTICES, ACTUAL MANAGERIAL PRACTICES ARE CHARACTERIZED AND ANALYZED BASED ON A MODEL USING ESTABLISHED THEORETICAL CONCEPTS OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT. DATA STEM FROM SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF STRATEGY DOCUMENTS AND BUDGET PLANS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS. IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THESE MUNICIPALITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED MANAGERIAL PRACTICES WHICH GENERALLY FOLLOW THE IDEAS OF POPULAR GERMAN REFORM BLUEPRINTS AND COMPLY WITH GENERAL IDEAS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH. RESULTS SUGGEST AN INHERENT CONNECTION BETWEEN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT WHEREAS ACTUAL PRACTICES, EVEN BETWEEN THE TEN CASES UNDER REVIEW, DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. THE CONCLUSION ARGUES THAT MORE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ABOUT MANAGERIAL PRACTICES COULD SUBSTANTIALLY ENRICH PUBLIC SCHOLARS' PERSPECTIVE ON THEORETICAL CONCEPTS SUCH AS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND ON THE PRECONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THESE CONCEPTS COULD CREATE BENEFITS FOR THE PUBLIC.
599	USING SUGGESTIVE PORTRAITS AND UNPUBLISHED EXCERPTS OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE, THIS TREND REPORT SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE WITHIN US LAW SCHOOLS AROUND MILITARY AND JURIDICAL INTERVENTIONS AIMING AT MANAGING VIOLENCE IN THE SOUTH. THESE ACADEMIC DEBATES ARE LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE FIELDS OF ACTIVISM, MEDIA, AND, ESPECIALLY, POLITICS. THEY ARE DRIVEN BY POSITIONS TAKEN FOR OR AGAINST THE POLICY OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IN IRAK AND ITS "GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR." THE TRAJECTORY OF SAMANTHA POWER IS EXEMPLARY IN THAT IT MOBILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF RESOURCES - LEGAL, POLITICAL AND MEDIA - THAT PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THE CURRENT DEBATE OVER THE QUALIFICATION OF THE DARFUR SITUATION AS A "GENOCIDE," THUS MAKING A CASE FOR A "JUST WAR." THE OPINIONS OF LIBERAL JURISTS TURN OUT TO BE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THOSE OF THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT, WHO CRITICIZE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR PRACTICING TORTURE AND DENYING JUSTICE BY HOLDING ONTO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE "RULE OF LAW." FINALLY, THE PORTRAITS OF CHERIF BASSIOUNI AND JUAN MENDEZ ILLUSTRATE A COMBINATION OF ACADEMIC AND ACTIVIST RESOURCES THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE POWERFUL PROCESS OF "JURIDICIZATION" OF CONFLICTS.
600	THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS OF MAY 2002 IN BURKINA FASO SAW THE RULING PARTY LOOSE ITS EXCLUSIONARY GRIP ON POWER. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY IN 1991, THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION NOW REPRESENTS A SIZEABLE GROUP. WHILE IT RETAINS THE MAJORITY, THE RULING PARTY HAS TO SHARE LEGISLATIVE POWER WITH THE OPPOSITION. THESE ELECTIONS MARGINALLY ALTER THE STRUCTURE OF POWER IN A DEEPLY PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL AND ELECTORAL REFORMS HAVE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN STRENGTHENING THE MECHANISMS OF `VERTICAL ACCOUNTABILITY' AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. BY ASSESSING RECENT ELECTORAL REFORMS IN BURKINA FASO, THE ARTICLE UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM IN MULTIPARTY ELECTIONS AND THUS CONTRIBUTES TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ELECTORAL RULES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL OUTCOMES. IN PARTICULAR, IT UNDERSCORES THE CONTRIBUTION THAT INSTITUTIONAL ENGINEERING AND ELECTORAL REFORM CAN MAKE TO FURTHER DEMOCRATISATION IN A SEMI-AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXT. WHILE MANY CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW REMAIN, THE NEW POLITICAL LANDSCAPE HOLDS THE PROMISE OF CHANGES IN THE STYLE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE EMERGENCE OF MORE CONSENSUAL MODES OF GOVERNANCE.
601	ROMANIANS SUFFERED INCREDIBLE DEPRIVATIONS OF EVERY SORT DURING THE DECADES OF COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP. MOST OF THE COUNTRY'S 1,000 PSYCHIATRISTS, AND MOST OF THEIR PATIENTS, WERE VICTIMIZED BY THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. A FEW PSYCHIATRISTS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PRACTICES AMOUNTING TO TORTURE. MANY, HOWEVER, BECAME WILLING OR UNWILLING PARTICIPANTS IN THE POLITICAL ABUSE OF THEIR PROFESSION. SUCH POLITICAL ABUSES WERE FOSTERED BY ABUSIVE LEGISLATION AND ABUSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BY THE SECRET POLICE. ABUSES INCLUDED: MASS DETENTIONS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS OF DISSIDENTS AND POLITICAL UNDESIRABLES; ABUSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAWS IN DETAINING PERSONS NOT SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS; FALSE, POLITICALLY MOTIVATED DIAGNOSES AND TREATMENT; AND DETENTION IN SECRET FACILITIES. WHILE THERE ARE HONEST EFFORTS TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE PAST, TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF PSYCHIATRIC ABUSE, AND TO INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ABUSERS, THERE IS ALSO MUCH RESISTANCE TO REFORM. REFORM-MINDED ROMANIAN PSYCHIATRISTS DESERVE THE SUPPORT OF THEIR WESTERN COLLEAGUES IN THE EFFORT TO RESTORE ROMANIAN PSYCHIATRY. IN PARTICULAR, PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE DRAFT LAW CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE ROMANIAN PARLIAMENT, WHICH IS INTENDED TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW TO THE PRACTICE OF PSYCHIATRY IN ROMANIA.
602	THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO CONSIDER APPROPRIATE FORMS OF INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS IN MODERN JURISPRUDENCE. IN THE MAIN CONTENT IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE INTERPRETATION RESULTS IN A GENERAL CONCLUSION OR A SUM OF CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE SUBJECT OF INTERPRETATION IN THE PROCESS OF CLARIFICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW (LEGAL NORMS), USING THE WHOLE SET OF METHODS OF INTERPRETATION, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO THE LEGAL REALITY. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH WAS PRESENTED AS COMPARATIVE-LEGAL AND SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS, FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, AS WELL AS HERMENEUTIC METHOD, METHOD OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE PROCEDURE FOR ACHIEVING THE PURPOSE OF INTERPRETATION SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: GRAMMATICAL INTERPRETATION - TELEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION - CLARIFICATION OF THE CONFORMITY OF THE ESSENCE OF THE CONTENT OF THE LEGAL NORM WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW - SYSTEMATIC INTERPRETATION - SPECIAL LEGAL INTERPRETATION - LOGICAL INTERPRETATION - FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION - HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION - REPEATED APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATION PROCEDURE UPON RECEIPT OF NEW DATA. IF THIS PROCEDURE IS PROPERLY FOLLOWED, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THE CONDITIONS FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF AN ADEQUATE LEGAL HERMENEUTICS, WHICH PLACES THE TEXTS IN THEIR CONTEXT OF MEANING.
603	DATA FROM SMALL SATELLITES ARE RAPIDLY CONVERGING WITH HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-VOLUME COMPUTATIONAL ANALYTICS. "SMALL SATELLITES, BIG DATA" (SSBD) CHANGES THE ABILITY OF DECISION-MAKERS TO PERSISTENTLY SEE AND ADDRESS AN ARRAY OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGES. AN ANALYSIS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES SHOWS HOW THEY CAN SUPPORT DECISIONS TO PROTECT OR ADVANCE NATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS BY DETECTING, ATTRIBUTING, AND CLASSIFYING HARMFUL, HOSTILE, OR UNLAWFUL MARITIME ACTIVITIES. HOW MIGHT THE MILITARY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO MARITIME THREATS IF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ELIMINATE ANONYMITY AT SEA? THE EMERGING EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON MARITIME ACTIVITIES IS INTERTWINED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY (E.G., TERRITORIAL AND RESOURCE CLAIMS, SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS, AND TERRORIST ATTACKS), LEGAL AND ILLICIT BUSINESSES (E.G., ILLEGAL FISHING, TRAFFICKING, AND PIRACY), AND OTHER CONCERNS (E.G., SHIPPING AND TRANSIT, CHOKEPOINTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE). THE ABILITY OF SSBD TECHNOLOGIES TO OBSERVE AND CATCH WRONGDOING IS IMPORTANT FOR GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE COMMERCIAL, ACADEMIC, AND NONGOVERNMENTAL SECTORS THAT HAVE VESTED INTERESTS IN MARITIME SECURITY, SUSTAINABLE OCEANS, AND THE RULE OF LAW AT SEA. BUT FINDINGS INDICATE THAT TRANSPARENCY ALONE IS UNLIKELY TO DETER MISCONDUCT OR CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF POWERFUL STATES.
604	THE EFFICIENT FUNCTIONING OF A MODEM STATE INVOLVES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENSURING THAT IT HAS ALL THE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, CULTURAL, LEGAL CONDITIONS THAT ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE COMPETENCE AND CAPACITY OF PERSONS TO ENGAGE, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER PEOPLE, IN CIVIC ACTIVITIES. AN ELOQUENT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE CASE OF POST-DECEMBER ROMANIA, WHERE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CONSOLIDATING THE NEW DEMOCRACY AND MONITORING THE RULE OF LAW. DESPITE A CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE DAILY PRESS, MANY AUTHORS AGREE THAT CIVIL SOCIETY AND ITS ROLE IN POST-DECEMBER PUBLIC LIFE IS AN INSUFFICIENTLY ANALYSED AND DEBATED TOPIC SO FAR. IN THIS STUDY WE AIM TO PRESENT SOME ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION PROCESS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN POST-DECEMBER ROMANIA. WE INSIST, ABOVE ALL, ON THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ONES. OUR WRITING IS SYNTHETIC AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE. WE WILL TRY TO OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENT CURVE OF THE CIVIL SPHERE FORMED AFTER THE TURN IN DECEMBER, SHOWING HOW THIS PATH WAS FORMED, WHAT FACTORS HAD AN IMPACT ON IT, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, AND WHAT CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITIES IT ACQUIRED.
605	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLAIN THE OBSERVABLY WEAK ROLE OF DOMESTIC CASE LAW IN SHAPING ACCESS TO THE ASYLUM PROCEDURE AT POLAND'S EASTERN BORDER. IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE LACK OF INFLUENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SAFEGUARDING FORCED MIGRANTS' RIGHT TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN POLAND. THE ASSESSMENT OF HOW THE CASE LAW IMPACTS THE COMPLEX REALITY OF ASYLUM SEEKERS TRYING TO ENTER POLISH TERRITORY MULTIPLE TIMES AND APPLY FOR INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION IS BASED ON ANALYSES OF BOTH LEGAL SOURCES (COURT RULINGS AND RELEVANT LEGISLATION) AND SOCIOLOGICAL MATERIAL (EXPERTS' OPINIONS AND STATISTICAL DATA). THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR BORDER CHECKS AND RECEIVING ASYLUM APPLICATIONS DOES NOT COMPLY WITH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CASE LAW. MOREOVER, THIS TAKES PLACE WITH GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT AND ACCEPTANCE. NON-COMPLIANCE STEMS FROM ANTI-REFUGEE SENTIMENTS THAT SPREAD THROUGH PUBLIC DEBATE IN A POST-2015 MIGRATORY CONTEXT IN POLAND, PORTRAYING FORCED MIGRANTS AS A THREAT TO SECURITY AND SOCIAL COHESION. THIS COINCIDED WITH THE PROGRESSIVE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND, WHICH HAS AFFECTED THE WAY ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT RESPOND TO AND INTERPRET ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGMENTS.
606	HOW DO PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES LAW ABIDING MOBILIZE AGAINST "OFFENSIVE" LAWS? STATED DIFFERENTLY, HOW DO PEOPLE ASSERT IMPUNITY? ALTHOUGH SOCIOLOGISTS ROBUSTLY DOCUMENT THE UNEQUAL ADMINISTRATION OF AMERICAN LAW, MOST FOCUS ON THE PRODUCTION AND LEGITIMATION OF RACIAL DISPARITIES THROUGH PUNISHMENT RATHER THAN IMPUNITY. WE USE THEORIES OF WHITENESS TO ANALYZE VIRGINIA'S SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY RESOLUTIONS, ILLUMINATING HOW IMPUNITY IS REPRODUCED AS A WHITE PREROGATIVE, TO ENGAGE SOCIOLOGICAL DEBATES SURROUNDING RACE AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THESE RESOLUTIONS DRAW ON AN IDEOLOGY OF RIGHTS CENTERED ON THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION TO BUTTRESS THEIR STANDING AND AFFIRM GUN-OWNING AMERICANS AS ENACTORS/DEFENDERS OF SOCIAL ORDER BY DECRYING STATE EFFORTS TO RESTRICT GUN ACCESS. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY SUPPORTERS ASSERT A RELATION OF IMPUNITY BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE LAW BY REFLECTING AND REPRODUCING WHITE HABITUS AND BY RECONSTRUCTING THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH RELIANCE ON EXCLUSIONARY TROPES INVOLVING AMERICAN VALUES, TRADITION, AND CONSTITUTIONALITY. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT RESOLUTION SUPPORTERS ROUTINELY ASSERTED SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARIES AS WHITE SANCTUARIES, TYING WHITENESS TO GUN RIGHTS AND SHAPING HOW SOCIAL STRUCTURES (INCLUDING LAWS) ARE ORGANIZED.
607	COOPERATION WITHIN AND ACROSS BORDERS IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS. PAROCHIALISM - THE TENDENCY TO COOPERATE MORE WITH INGROUP THAN OUTGROUP MEMBERS - LIMITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS. NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM (I.E., GREATER COOPERATION AMONG MEMBERS OF THE SAME NATION) COULD VARY ACROSS NATIONS AND HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH RULE OF LAW, EXPOSURE TO WORLD RELIGIONS, RELATIONAL MOBILITY AND PATHOGEN STRESS. WE CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT IN PARTICIPANTS FROM 42 NATIONS (N = 18,411), AND OBSERVE COOPERATION IN A PRISONER'S DILEMMA WITH INGROUP, OUTGROUP, AND UNIDENTIFIED PARTNERS. WE OBSERVE THAT NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM IS A UBIQUITOUS PHENOMENON: IT IS PRESENT TO A SIMILAR DEGREE ACROSS THE NATIONS STUDIED HERE, IS INDEPENDENT OF CULTURAL DISTANCE, AND OCCURS BOTH WHEN DECISIONS ARE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC. THESE FINDINGS INFORM EXISTING THEORIES OF PAROCHIALISM AND SUGGEST IT MAY BE AN OBSTACLE TO THE PROVISION OF GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS. NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM IS THE TENDENCY TO COOPERATE MORE WITH PEOPLE OF THE SAME NATION. IN A 42-NATIONS STUDY, THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT NATIONAL PAROCHIALISM IS A PERVASIVE PHENOMENON, PRESENT TO A SIMILAR DEGREE ACROSS ALL THE STUDIED NATIONS, AND OCCURS BOTH WHEN DECISIONS ARE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC.
608	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, MANY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE ADOPTED E-GOVERNMENT AS AN ANTI-CORRUPTION TOOL. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACTS OF E-GOVERNMENT ON CORRUPTION. THUS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE WHETHER E-GOVERNMENT REDUCES CORRUPTION ACROSS COUNTRIES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM 2003 TO 2016 WERE COLLECTED FROM 214 COUNTRIES AND THEN PANEL DATA ANALYSIS BASED ON A FIXED-EFFECT MODEL WAS CONDUCTED. ANALYSIS RESULTS REVEAL THAT E-GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CORRUPTION, WHILE THE EFFECTS OF OPEN GOVERNMENT AS ONE TYPE OF E-GOVERNMENT ARE UNCLEAR. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPEN GOVERNMENT AND CORRUPTION. THAT IS, IN COUNTRIES WITH MORE EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEMS, OPEN GOVERNMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO REDUCE CORRUPTION THAN IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEMS. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS E-GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE CORRUPTION. OPEN GOVERNMENT, SUCH AS OPEN DATA PORTALS AND ONLINE DISCUSSION FORUMS, DOES NOT HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE REDUCTION OF CORRUPTION. OPEN GOVERNMENT CAN HAVE A CONDITIONAL IMPACT ON CORRUPTION, RELYING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL SYSTEMS.
609	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAMIC BANKING DEVELOPMENT, MAJOR MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ISLAMIC COUNTRIES. USING THE PANEL SMOOTH TRANSITION MODEL, THE RESULTS SHOW A POSITIVE NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAMIC BANKING DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. MOREOVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS ASYMMETRIC AND REGIME-DEPENDENT. FURTHER, BY USING THE DYNAMIC PANEL QUANTILE MODEL, WE SHOW THAT FOR MANY CASES THE ISLAMIC BANKING VARIABLES LEAD ECONOMIC GROWTH ACROSS THE QUANTILES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, OIL PRODUCTION AND INFLATION HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH DURING THE NORMAL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT STATE, WHILE GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION, ONE-LAG ECONOMIC GROWTH, TERMS OF TRADE AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR THIS STATE. THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX, EDUCATION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT, REGARDLESS OF THE PREVAILING REGIME. THE RESULTS FOR THE SEPARATED OIL-IMPORTING AND OIL-EXPORTING ECONOMIES ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE COMBINED SAMPLE REGARDING THE ISLAMIC BANKING DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES. AS FOR THE MACRO VARIABLES, THEY HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT (INSIGNIFICANT) EFFECT ON EG FOR THE OIL-IMPORTING (OIL-EXPORTING) ECONOMIES FOR ALMOST ALL MODELS.
610	ESTABLISHING A NEW COMPETITION LAW REGIME IS NEVER AN EASY TASK, ESPECIALLY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE CURRENT LITERATURE OF COMPETITION LAW IS RICH WITH SUGGESTIONS ON THE BEST POLITICAL ECONOMY PRECONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO AN EFFECTIVE COMPETITION LAW REGIME. IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT COUNTRIES WITH A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REGIME AND A STABLE RULE OF LAW ARE MORE INCLINED TO ENACT NATIONAL COMPETITION LAW. MOREOVER, COUNTRIES THAT EMBRACE THE PRINCIPLE OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION, PRIVATIZATION, AND MARKET ECONOMY ARE A FERTILE GROUND TO THE GROWTH OF COMPETITION LAW. YET, THE ENACTMENTS OF MYANMAR COMPETITION LAW IN 2015 AND THAILAND NEW COMPETITION LAW IN 2017 DEVIATE FROM THIS GENERAL UNDERSTANDING. NATURALLY, IT IS ASSUMED THAT COMPETITION LAWS ADOPTED IN THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BE STARKLY DIFFERENT FROM PRE-EXISTING COMPETITION LAWS. IT HINTS TOWARDS AN EMERGING TREND OF COMPETITION LAW, ONE WHICH MANAGES TO ENACT AND ENFORCE COMPETITION LAW REGARDLESS OF THE REALITY OF THE LOCAL POLITICAL ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE CAUSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DEVIATION, WITHOUT IMMATURELY EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH YOUNG REGIMES. IT CONCLUDES WITH INVESTIGATING THE LIKELY SOURCE BEHIND IT, SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THE ASEAN, IN WHICH BOTH MYANMAR AND THAILAND ARE MEMBER STATES, IS BEHIND SUCH PHENOMENON.
611	THIS PAPER IS WRITTEN TO REFLECT HUMAN DIGNITY IN PRACTICE WITH REFERENCE TO THE CROSS REMOVAL INCIDENTS IN CHINA IN ZHEJIANG PROVINCE BETWEEN 2014 AND 2016. THIS PAPER STARTS WITH THREE QUESTIONS: HOW DID THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES TREAT CHRISTIANS? HOW DID CHRISTIANS RESPOND TO WHAT THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES DID TO THEM? HOW DID CHRISTIANS VIEW THEMSELVES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TREATMENT OF THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES? IN CONTRAST WITH THE INDIGNITY OF THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES, CHRISTIANS IN THEIR RESISTANCE HAVE DISPLAYED A DIGNIFIED MANNER CHARACTERIZED BY NON-VIOLENCE AND FORGIVENESS, AS WELL AS THE SPIRITUALITY OF PERSISTENCE IN TRUTH AND LIVING IN HOPE. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHURCHES IN THESE INCIDENTS HAS REVEALED BOTH THE HOPE AND CONSTRAINTS OF HUMAN DIGNITY IN PRACTICE, THAT IS, THE RULE OF LAW AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, DIGNITY AND THE FACE CULTURE IN CHINA, AND DIGNITY AS RESPECT-AS-OBSERVANCE. CHRISTIANS IN THEIR RESISTANCE MAY HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS CONDITIONS IN CHINA, BUT AS THE DAO DE JING SAYS, A JOURNEY OF A THOUSAND MILES BEGINS WITH A SINGLE STEP. THUS, CHRISTIAN RESISTANCE IS ONE OF THE MANY STEPS TO PROTECT AND RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY.
612	TRADITIONAL JURISPRUDENCE HAS PRODUCED FEW STUDIES AT THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL OPERATION, RESULTING IN A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE, ACTORS AND SYMBOLS INVOLVED IN THE MODERNIZATION OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE. THIS IS SO MUCH SO THAT MODERNIZATION OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE IS IN PRACTICE MISUNDERSTOOD AS THE RULE OF LAW, INFORMATIZATION AND ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY. THE CORE ISSUE OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE IS THE DIVISION OF OVERSIGHT AND PENALTY COSTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND INDIVIDUALS, BUT WE NEED TO CALL UPON A STATUTORY PLATFORM TO FACILITATE COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RIGHTS. THE MODERNIZATION OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE INVOLVES THE USE OF LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE TECHNIQUES AND STATUTORY PLATFORMS FOR COOPERATION IN AN OPEN SOCIETY, ENSURING THE REASONABLE DIVISION OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE INFORMATION AND PENALTY COSTS WHEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RIGHTS OVERLAP. THE SOCIAL GOVERNANCE TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RIGHTS TO WORK TOGETHER INVOLVE TAKING A GROUP OF OBSERVABLE SYMBOLS OR ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH CONSENSUS HAS BEEN REACHED AS A STATUTORY PLATFORM, WITH ALL SIDES BRINGING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY TO BEAR ON THIS PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THEIR INTERESTS AND MINIMIZE THEIR TRANSACTION COSTS, WITH NO NEED TO INQUIRE FURTHER INTO ITS PARTICULAR CONSTITUTION.
613	IN THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) LITERATURE, THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLUNTARISM IS PREDOMINANT AND IMPLIES THAT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE DISCRETIONARY AND REACH BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PRINCIPLE FAILS TO EXPLAIN THAT GOVERNMENTS HAVE A GREAT INTEREST IN CSR AND EXERCISE INFLUENCE ON FIRMS' CSR ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, WE ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF A CONTINGENCY APPROACH ON VOLUNTARISM IN CSR. TO THIS END, WE ANALYSE THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW GOVERNMENTS ARE PART OF THE CSR DEBATE. WE SELECTED 703 PAPERS WHERE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENTS IS MENTIONED FROM FIVE JOURNALS IN OUR FIELD (BEER, BEQ, BSE, BAS, JBE) IN THE PERIOD 1982-2011. WE STUDIED THE TITLES AND ABSTRACTS OF THESE PAPERS AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF: (I) THE GEOGRAPHICAL ORIENTATION OF THE REVIEWED STUDIES; (II) THE VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT LEVELS INVOLVED; AND (III) THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS WHERE GOVERNMENTS APPEAR TO BE INVOLVED. IN ADDITION, AN IN-DEPTH READING OF A SUBSAMPLE OF 39 ARTICLES OFFERS MORE DETAILS ON THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE CSR LITERATURE. HENCE, WE OFFER A STRUCTURED OVERVIEW ON THE DISCUSSION OF CSR AND GOVERNMENTS WHILE STIMULATING A CONTINGENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE VOLUNTARISM CONCEPT IN CSR.
614	DRAMATIC CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, SUCH AS THE EXPANDING ARENAS FOR APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE EMERGENCE OF A SERIES OF NEW LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THE PARALLEL EXTENSION OF BOTH RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF STATES. IN RECENT YEARS, NEW DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN ARISING IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM, MANIFESTED BY THREE IMPORTANT SETS OF TRANSITION, THAT IS, FROM A "SOVEREIGN PRIORITY" TO A "HUMAN RIGHTS PRIORITY"; FROM "CONSENTORIENTATION" TO "COERCION-ORIENTATION"; AND FROM "INTEGRITY" TO "FRAGMENTATION." THE RISE OF CHINA AND THE EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE CLOSELY RELATED: WHILE CHINA'S ASCENT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM, A MORE PROSPEROUS AND STRONGER CHINA WILL CERTAINLY INFLUENCE THE FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF THE EVOLVING SYSTEM. CHINA SHOULD AND CAN BE A POSITIVE FORCE IN CONSTRUCTING A CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER THROUGH PROMOTING DOMESTIC JUSTICE AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IN THIS PROCESS, CHINA NEEDS TO TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE ROLE AND EVOLVE FROM BEING A RECIPIENT TO A RULE-MAKER, IN ORDER TO MODIFY THE OUTDATED PRINCIPLES AND RULES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW.
615	BIODIESEL FROM JATROPHA HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AS A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TO FOSSIL FUELS FOR SOME TIME. CONSEQUENTLY, CHINA STARTED PROMOTING JATROPHA AS ONE OF THE OPTIONS TO MEET ITS EVER-INCREASING ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND THE CHINESE BIODIESEL INDUSTRY ALSO GAINED INTEREST. HOWEVER, THE EXCITEMENT OF THE BIOFUEL INDUSTRY IN JATROPHA FADED AFTER IT DID NOT BRING ABOUT THE EXPECTED RESULTS. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE STAGNATION IN JATROPHA DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION FOR BIODIESEL IN CHINA, USING TWO DETAILED CASE STUDIES OF JATROPHA BIOFUEL PRODUCTION IN SOUTHEAST CHINA. IT IS FOUND THAT THE UNDERDEVELOPED BIODIESEL POLICY AND REGULATION, SUCH AS A RATHER LATE FORMULATION OF STANDARDS FOR BIODIESEL (ESPECIALLY THE B5) AND THE ABSENCE OF MANDATORY TARGETS, IS AN IMPORTANT REASON FOR HAMPERING JATROPHA DEVELOPMENT. BESIDES THAT, LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT UNDERMINED SUSTAINED JATROPHA PLANTING AT THE FARM LEVEL AND LACK OF SUSTAINED COMMITMENT FROM STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES OR PRIVATE COMPANIES OVER A LONG TIME SPAN FURTHER CONTRIBUTED TO JATROPHA PROJECT'S FAILURE. BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, MANDATORY BLENDING REQUIREMENTS, HAZARD INSURANCE, AS WELL AS CONTINUOUS FINANCIAL SUPPORT, MIGHT IMPROVE THE CONTINUATION OF JATROPHA PLANTATION SCHEMES.
616	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CHALLENGE THE WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THAT RIO DE JANEIRO IS A DIVIDED CITY BY DEPLOYING TWO CONCEPTS IN CRITICAL CARTOGRAPHY: CARTOGRAPHIC SILENCES AND CARTOGRAPHIC CALCULATIONS. AS A KIND OF UNCONQUERED TERRITORY, A TERRAE INCOGNITAE, FAVELAS WERE SILENCED ON MANY OF RIO DE JANERIO'S MAPS OVER THE LAST CENTURY. WHEN THESE PLACES BEGAN TO BE MAPPED, AND CONVERTED TO TERRAE COGNITAE, POWER RELATIONS OFTEN BECOME EVEN MORE APPARENT BECAUSE OF THE INTENTION TO MAKE IT LEGIBLE FOR PURPOSES OF INTERVENTION. BY ANALYZING MAPS PUBLISHED IN THE MAINSTREAM BRAZILIAN PRESS THROUGHOUT THE LAST CENTURY, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW NATIONAL PRESS OFTEN PORTRAYS RIO DE JANEIRO AS A CITY DIVIDED BETWEEN FORMAL NEIGHBORHOODS, WHERE THE STATE APPARATUS CAN ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW, AND FAVELAS, WHERE PARALLEL POLITICS ENFORCE LOCAL FORMS OF GOVERNANCE. IN ORDER TO DISSEMINATE THIS IMAGE OF THE CITY, MAPS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE, LOCATING DIFFERENT URBAN ZONES AND REINFORCING OLD STEREOTYPES. DESPITE MANY STUDIES THAT FOCUSED ON BOTH MATERIAL AND EMBODIED FORMS OF STATE PRESENCE WITHIN FAVELAS, MAPS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND PERSISTANT REPRESENTATIONS OF FAVELAS AS EXCLUDED AND DIVIDED PLACES.
617	LAW, AND THEREFORE COURTS, CAN ONLY MAKE SENSE OF COLLECTIVE AGENCY IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTED POWER THAT IS POWER EXERCISED IN CONFORMITY WITH LAW. HOWEVER, CONSTITUENT POWER, INSOFAR AS IT PURPORTS TO CREATE A NEW LEGAL ORDER, CANNOT ACT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE EXISTING LEGAL ORDER. CONSTITUENT POWER CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD AS LAWFUL, THEREFORE, IF IT IS UNDERSTOOD RETROACTIVELY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NEW LEGAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE ICJ'S TREATMENT OF THE CONSTITUENT POWER OF 'THE PEOPLE' IN THE KOSOVAN DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA'S CONSIDERATION OF THE QUEBECOIS LEGAL RIGHT TO SECEDE. CONSIDERING THE LITERATURE ON CONSTITUENT POWER AND THE ONTOLOGY OF 'THE PEOPLE', THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW OFFER A PARTIAL SOLUTION TO THE PARADOX OF CONSTITUENT POWER. IT INTRODUCES JOHN SEARLE'S ONTOLOGY OF 'INSTITUTIONAL FACTS', ARGUING THAT THE NATURE OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A 'STATUS FUNCTION' CREATED BY A 'DECLARATION'. IT CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING THE LIMITS TO THE JUSTICIABILITY OF CONSTITUENT POWER AND THE COROLLARY NECESSITY FOR RECOGNITION, OR WHAT DERRIDA CALLS A 'LAST INSTANCE'.
618	IN THE YEARS 2008 AND 2009, THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (CCC) ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL COMMUNITY, WHEN IT RULED TWICE ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE LISBON TREATY WITH THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. 1 IN BOTH CASES, THE CCC HAS CONSTRUCTED ITS REVIEW AROUND A 'SUPER-RIGID', NON-AMENDABLE, CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE 9 PARAGRAPH 2, WHICH BANS CHANGES OF ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SUPER-RIGID CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FORMS A MATERIAL CORE OF THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND ESTABLISHES, IN THE CCC'S OPINION, ULTIMATE LIMITS OF TRANSFER OF COMPETENCIES EVEN TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN BOTH ITS 'LISBON' RULINGS, THE CCC DECLARED THAT THE LISBON TREATY HAS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY INTERVENED INTO THE 'MATERIAL CORE' OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND CZECH PARTICIPATION IN THE POST-LISBON EU WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPATIBLE. 2 THE PROCESS OF ELABORATION OF THE CONCEPT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL MATERIAL CORE BY THE CCC HAS NOT STOPPED THERE AND THE CCC USED THE YEARS 2009-2012 TO FURTHER DEVELOP ITS CASE LAW BOTH REGARDING ACTIVITIES OF THE CZECH PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN UNION.
619	THE SANCTITY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF AN ECONOMY. HOWEVER, IN SOME COUNTRIES, THE RULER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THE SUPREMACY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IS SOMETIMES SEEN EXPROPRIATING PRIVATE PROPERTY. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS VASTLY REQUIRED TO RESTRICT GRABBERS FROM ATTENUATING PROPERTY RIGHTS. BECAUSE COURT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE NOT ONLY IN INTERPRETING THE LAW BUT ALSO BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER FIRST, LOOKS FOR THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN SOUTH KOREA THROUGH THE LENS OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. IN RELATION TO PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEWS WERE REQUIRED IF ANY CLAUSE IN THE EXISTING LAWS GOES SUBVERSIVE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY. THE PAPER THEN ANALYZES SOME WIDELY CITED CASES RELEVANT TO PROPERTY RIGHTS ISSUE BEFORE AND AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN KOREA. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT IN THE PRE-DEMOCRATIC ERA THE COURT'S ACTIVITIES WERE FREQUENTLY INTERVENED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HENCE THE COURT DID NOT POSSESS SUFFICIENT POWER TO UPHOLD THE SPIRIT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY. HOWEVER, IN THE POST-DEMOCRATIC REGIME, THE COURT HAS BEEN BESTOWED WITH ADEQUATE DISCRETION AND THEREFORE, PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE BETTER PROTECTED.
620	THE CURRENT APPROACH TO COUNTERING THE THREAT OF IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (IEDS) IN AFGHANISTAN HAS MET WITH LIMITED SUCCESS. THE RELATIVE LACK OF SUCCESS MAY BE IN PART BECAUSE THE CURRENT APPROACH IS NOT HOLISTIC AND DISCOUNTS THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS THAT FOSTER THE IEDS. INSURGENTS ARE USING IEDS AS A TOOL TO FURTHER THEIR STRATEGIC AIMS, BUT THE COALITION AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN (GIROA) ARE ATTACKING THE IEDS AS IF THEY ARE AN END IN AND OF THEMSELVES. COMBINING NETWORK DISRUPTION WITH INFORMATION CHANGE MAXIMIZES THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MITIGATING THE IED THREAT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO MITIGATE THE IED THREAT REQUIRES DISRUPTING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IEDS, AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVING RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTER-IED (C-IED) MUST BE COUNTER-INSURGENCY (COIN) CENTRIC TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF C-IED EFFORTS, IDENTIFIES FIVE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT APPROACH, AND SUGGESTS CHANGES TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE IED THREAT IN AFGHANISTAN.
621	SELECTION AND TENURE RULES ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE, "PACKAGES" OF INSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS THAT PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES. THE APPOINTMENTS PROCESS IS A POLITICAL ONE BY CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN; IT ALLOWS FOR A FORM OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION, THROUGH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, IN THE SELECTION OF FEDERAL JUDGES. THROUGH A VARIETY OF RULES-SOME CONSTITUTIONAL, OTHERS A MATTER OF SENATE OR WHITE HOUSE PRACTICE-THIS PROCESS HAS WORKED IN COMPLEX WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE CONCERNS BY THE POLITICAL BRANCHES ABOUT PARTISAN AFFILIATION AND IDEOLOGY, COMPETENCE, AND THE DEMOGRAPHIC MIX OF APPOINTEES. ALTHOUGH MOST NOMINEES TO THE ARTICLE III COURTS CONTINUE TO BE APPROVED BY OVERWHELMING MAJORITIES IN THE SENATE, THE RANCOR OF THE PROCESS IN RECENT YEARS HAS SEEMINGLY SHARPENED, LEADING TO SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGE IN. THE SENATE'S VOTING RULES ON NOMINATIONS. THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE PROCESS IN TURN PERMITS DISPUTES TO BECOME CONTENTIOUS IN WAYS, AND THROUGH MEANS, THAT COULD THREATEN THE STRUCTURES OR CULTURE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE ARTICLE III COURTS. FOR THESE REASONS, THE TENURE RULES ASSUME SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN SAFEGUARDING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE LONG TRADITION THAT ARTICLE III JUDGES ARE NOT REMOVED FROM OFFICE BASED ON DISAGREEMENT WITH THEIR LEGAL DECISIONS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PACKAGE. A NUMBER OF SCHOLARS HAVE RECENTLY ARGUED THAT THE TERMS OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SHOULD BE LIMITED TO EIGHTEEN YEARS. COMPARATIVE EXPERIENCES SUGGEST THAT SERIOUS LEVELS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE CAN BE ATTAINED THROUGH LONG, NONRENEWABLE TERMS. BUT SUCH A CHANGE IN AN ESTABLISHED AND ONGOING SYSTEM, WITH AN EXISTING PACKAGE OF INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OPERATING IN A SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL CULTURE, WOULD HAVE RAMIFICATIONS ELSEWHERE FOR THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, FOR THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF THE COURT, FOR ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE LOWER FEDERAL COURTS, AND POSSIBLY FOR THE STABILITY OF LAW-THAT REQUIRE CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS CONSIDERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATIONS WERE TO HAPPEN EVERY TWO YEARS, SHOULD THE "PACKAGE" INCLUDE CHANGES IN SELECTION PROCEDURE, PERHAPS TO REQUIRE A SUPERMAJORITY VOTE TO CONFIRM? MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE III FEDERAL COURTS, HEADED BY THE SUPREME COURT, HAVE FUNCTIONED AS THE JUDICIAL ANCHORS FOR THE SUPREMACY OF FEDERAL LAW IN A LARGE COUNTRY WHOSE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS USE MANY DIFFERENT SELECTION SYSTEMS (INCLUDING ELECTIONS FOR FAIRLY SHORT TERMS IN SOME OF THE STATE COURTS) AND WHICH HAS MANAGED TO SUSTAIN A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE FEDERAL COURTS ARE, IN A SENSE, PART OF AN OVERALL "PACKAGE" THAT IS THE U.S. COURT SYSTEM, WHOSE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION HAS ACCOMMODATED THE STATES' FREEDOM TO ADOPT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO JUDICIAL SELECTION AND TENURE, PERHAPS IN PART BY ASSURING THE STRONG INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARTICLE III FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH SALARY AND TENURE PROVISIONS. CAREFUL THOUGHT IS THUS REQUIRED BEFORE CHANGING ONE OF THE PILLARS OF THIS ONGOING SYSTEM.
622	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS STUDIES ON THE DEFINITION OF THE CONTENT OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL LAW AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS, SINCE THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES IN FINANCIAL LAW CONSTITUTE A SINGLE SYSTEM AND PRESENT ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE LEGAL REGIME OF REGULATION OF PUBLIC RELATIONS IN THE AREA OF PUBLIC FINANCE. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE ADVANCES OF LEGAL SCIENCE THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE WORKS OF SCHOLARS WHO COVER LEGAL ISSUES AT THE THEORETICAL LEVEL AND OF THOSE WHOSE RESEARCH INTEREST COVERS THE AREA OF FINANCIAL LAW. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL LAW WAS REVEALED BY E.A. ROVINSKIY, WHO, ACCORDING TO N.I. KHIMICHEVA, CHARACTERIZED THEM AS THE PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE'S FINANCIAL ACTIVITY. THIS APPROACH IS ALSO USED IN MODERN STUDIES OF SUCH SCHOLARS AS YU.A. KROKHINA, E.YU. GRACHEVA, A.N. KOZYRIN, N.A. SATTAROVA, AND OTHERS. THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE STUDY INCLUDES SYSTEMIC AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, COMPARISON AND GROUPING, INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. ON THE BASIS OF THE STUDY, IT IS PROPOSED TO DIVIDE THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL LAW INTO TWO GROUPS: (1) GENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES (INCLUDING SECTORAL SPECIFICS) AND (2) GENERAL FINANCIAL AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE TO REFER TO GENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES THE FOLLOWING ONES: THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL FREEDOM, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMANITY, THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY (OR EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW), THE PRINCIPLE OF FAULT LIABILITY AND THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF ALL FORMS OF OWNERSHIP. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE TO REFER TO GENERAL FINANCIAL AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF THE FINANCIAL, BUDGETARY, FISCAL, BANKING AND MONETARY SYSTEMS OF THE STATE; THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL POLICY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM; THE PRINCIPLE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY OF THE STATE; THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL AUTHORITIES. THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY IN FINANCIAL LAW HAS BEEN STUDIED. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE IN FINANCIAL LAW DOES NOT HAVE A PRECISE GENERAL MEANING. FOR FINANCIAL LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW MEANS THAT ALL PUBLIC FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE REGULATED BY LEGAL NORMS. THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF THE FINANCIAL, BUDGETARY, FISCAL, BANKING AND MONETARY SYSTEMS OF THE STATE IS OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND INTERACTION OF FINANCIAL POLICY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF FINANCIAL LAW DETERMINES THE CORRELATION OF ALL LEVELS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE CONTINUOUS IMPACT OF GOVERNMENTAL MEASURES ON PUBLIC FINANCE. IN THE CONTEXT OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, THE PRINCIPLE OF FINANCIAL SECURITY OF THE STATE IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE.
623	THE IRZ FOUNDATION SUPPORTS THE PROCESS OF LEGAL REFORM IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS COMMISSION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE WORK OF THE FOUNDATION CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ELEMENT OF FOREIGN AND LEGAL POLICY ADVICE ON ESTABLISHING AND REORGANISING NATIONAL RULE-OF-LAW-ORIENTATED LEGAL SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS AN INDEPENDENT, WELL-FUNCTIONING JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE FOUNDATION WAS ESTABLISHED AS A REACTION TO THE MANY ENQUIRIES, ASKING FOR HELP IN FORTHCOMING REFORMS, WITH WHICH THE TRANSITION STATES OF CENTRAL, EASTERN AND SOUTHEAST EUROPE HAD APPROACHED THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF JUSTICE. THIS INCLUDED A COMPREHENSIVE NEED FOR BASIC AND FURTHER TRAINING MEASURES FOR ALL LEGAL PROFESSIONS. THE FACTUAL FOCI OF THE ADVICE OFFERED LIE IN THE FOLLOWING LEGAL AREAS: CREATING CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF PRIVATE LAW, IN PARTICULAR A PRIVATE OWNERSHIP SYSTEM, AND CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR PRIVATE LAW TRANSACTIONS AND THE ECONOMIC EXCHANGE OF GOODS AND SERVICES, CREATING A PUBLIC-LAW FRAMEWORK FOR ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE LAWFULNESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE GUARANTEE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. PROJECT WORK CONSISTS OF ADVISING THE PARTNER INSTITUTIONS IN PREPARING, DRAFTING AND IMPLEMENTING STATUTES. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT LIMITED TO WORKING OUT LEGISLATION AND RESTRUCTURING THE JUDICIARY. FURTHER TRAINING FOR LEGAL PRACTITIONERS, IN OTHER WORDS FOR ALL JUDGES, PUBLIC PROSECUTORS, LAWYERS AND NOTARIES WHO MUST APPLY THE NEW LAW, IS ALSO CONSIDERED A MAJOR PRIORITY. THE IRZ FOUNDATION HAS, IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL ADVISORY INSTITUTIONS, EXPERIENCED A VERY POSITIVE ECHO AND LEVEL OF ACCEPTANCE. A MAJOR CRITERION OF THE COMPARATIVELY SUCCESSFUL WORK IS THE FACT THAT IT IS REPRESENTED WITH OFFICES IN SITU IN WHICH LOCAL LEGAL EXPERTS ARE EMPLOYED AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ADVICE CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF IT APPRECIATES THE COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCORPORATES THEM INTO ITS OWN ADVICE ACTIVITIES. THE STRUCTURE OF THE IRZ FOUNDATION GUARANTEES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO REACT FLEXIBLY AND RAPIDLY TO THE SOMETIMES EXTREMELY SHORT-NOTICE ENQUIRIES FOR ADVICE ARRIVING FROM THE PARTNER COUNTRIES. IN THIS REGARD, NATIONAL LEGAL TRADITIONS AND SPECIFIC LEGAL POLICY CONCERNS AND WISHES, AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTABILITY OF THE NEW LAW, ARE THE FOCUS OF CONCENTRATED WORK. LEGAL ADVICE IN REFORM AND TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES IS A COMPARABLY AFFORDABLE METHOD OF SUPPORT THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. AS THERE HAVE BEEN SETBACKS, AND INDEED FAILURES, THE REFORMS OF THE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS ARE BY NO MEANS CONCLUDED. THE FOUNDATION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND ADVISE THE TRANSFORMATION STATES ON THEIR ARDUOUS PATH AS LONG AS THERE IS SUPPORT AND FINANCE AVAILABLE FOR THIS IN GERMANY.
624	THE SUBJECT. THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO PROBLEMS OF INSTITUTE OF LEGAL AID IN GERMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE HYPOTHESIS THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS THE MAIN BUT NOT EXCLUSIVE FORM OF LEGAL AID IN GERMANY. THE METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY INCLUDES ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS OF GERMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION, DESCRIPTION OF DECISIONS OF GERMAN FEDERAL COURT OF JUSTICE AND INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL STUDIES CONCERNING LEGAL AID ISSUES. HE MAIN RESULTS AND SCOPE OF THEIR APPLICATION. THE RIGHT TO STATE SUPPORT FOR EQUAL ACCESS TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION, REGARDLESS OF PROPERTY STATUS, HAS CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THE PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL CLAIMS, AND, THEREFORE, THE NEED TO GO TO THE COURT. THUS, ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION FOR ALL, INCLUDING THE NEEDY PERSONS, IS A DUTY OF A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. AN IMPORTANT GUARANTEE IN THIS CASE IS LEGAL AID. IN GERMANY, THIS AID, ENSHRINED IN CIVIL PROCEDURE LAW, IS A SPECIAL REFLECTION OF THE GENERAL SOCIAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTION OF SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE AUTHOR REVEALS THE STRUCTURE OF THE MAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE PROCESS AND COVERED BY THE LEGAL AID, AS WELL AS CONDITIONS FOR THE PROVISION OF SUCH ASSISTANCE IN GERMANY - PERSONAL PRECONDITIONS AND PREREQUISITES REGARDING THE PROSPECTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE PROCESS. THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE RISK OF A POOR PARTY THAT ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOSS PROCESS AND THE REIMBURSEMENT COURT COSTS TO THE PREVAILING PARTY. IN ADDITION, THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID DOES NOT EXEMPT FROM THE OBLIGATION OF ITS SUBSEQUENT REIMBURSEMENT TO THE FEDERAL LAND BUDGET FROM FREE REVENUES. THE COMPILATION AND MAINTENANCE OF STATISTICS ON THE COST OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS BY THE FEDERAL STATES OF GERMANY, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE LION'S SHARE OF THE COSTS OF MAINTAINING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, SEEMS JUSTIFIED FROM A FISCAL POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE SHOULD BE SUBORDINATED TO THE LOGIC OF ECONOMIC PROFITABILITY OF "SERVICES" FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION. CONCLUSIONS. THE PROVISION OF LEGAL AID IN GERMANY REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF A SET OF CONDITIONS-RELATING TO BOTH THE PERSON AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE CASE. HOWEVER, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN THE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE LEGAL AID, ANOTHER IS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SIMPLIFICATION OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURE. IT IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE STATE TO CHOOSE THE MEANS OF LEGAL AID TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS, HOWEVER IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT QUALIFIED LEGAL ASSISTANCE.
625	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE INVIOLABILITY OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHTS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES. THESE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE EU WAS ELEVATED TO THE RANK OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES OF THE EU CHARTER ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 2000, AND THE LISBON TREATY OF 2007, WHICH AS A RESULT OF SUCCESSFUL RATIFICATION BY ALL MEMBER STATES OF THE EU ENTERED INTO FORCE ON 1 JANUARY 2009. CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ACT AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE CATEGORY "VALUES" FOR THE FIRST TIME ENSHRINED IN THE EU CHARTER ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 2000. THE EU CHARTER BECAME LEGALLY BINDING WITH THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE LISBON TREATY (1 JANUARY 2009). THE PREAMBLE OF THE EU CHARTER PROCLAIMS THAT "CONSCIOUS OF ITS SPIRITUAL AND MORAL HISTORICAL HERITAGE, THE UNION IS BASED ON INDIVISIBLE AND UNIVERSAL VALUES - HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, EQUALITY AND SOLIDARITY; THE UNION RESTS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW". THAT IS THE FIRST TIME IN EUROPEAN UNION LAW ESTABLISHES THE SYSTEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES, WHERE THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE INVIOLABILITY OF HUMAN DIGNITY. FURTHER, THE PREAMBLE ESTABLISHES THAT THIS CHARTER REAFFIRMS THE RIGHTS, WHICH STEM PRIMARILY FROM THE COMMON TO THE MEMBER STATES CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS AND INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. THUS, IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE SYSTEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL VALUES OF THE EU IS ITS FORMATION IN EUROPEAN LAW FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS OF ALL EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, INDICATING THAT THEY ARE COMMON TO ALL EU COUNTRIES. THE LISBON TREATY INTRODUCES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE FOUNDING TREATIES OF THE EU, NAMELY THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION AND TO THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH SUPERSEDES THE CURRENT TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. IMPORTANT LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS A NEW ARTICLE 6 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH STATES THAT "THE UNION RECOGNISES THE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS 2000, AND THE CHARTER WILL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL FORCE AS THE TREATIES THEMSELVES". IN THE SAME ARTICLE, INDICATED THAT THE UNION JOINS THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS 1950. THUS, THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE LISBON TREATY OF 2007, AND AS A RESULT, THE ACQUISITION OF THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF 2000 LEGAL FORCE OPENS A NEW STAGE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, WHICH WILL LEAD THE EUROPEAN UNION TO A NEW STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.
626	PURPOSETHIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, SIZE OF CENTRAL BANK ASSET, BANKING SECTOR COST EFFICIENCY AND BANK INSOLVENCY RISK.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE AUTHORS EMPLOY THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) REGRESSION METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY ON TWO MEASURES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN NIGERIA.FINDINGSTHE ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY INCREASES REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH. THE ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY DECREASES REAL GDP PER CAPITA DURING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS. THE ABNORMAL INCREASE IN DOMESTIC CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON GDP PER CAPITA WHEN THERE IS STRONG LEGAL SYSTEM QUALITY IN NIGERIA. IN CONTRAST, THE ABNORMAL INCREASE IN DOMESTIC CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON REAL GDP GROWTH WHEN THERE IS STRONG LEGAL SYSTEM QUALITY IN NIGERIA.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSTHE ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY IS INEFFECTIVE IN INCREASING GDP PER CAPITA DURING CRISIS YEARS. POLICYMAKERS SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN PRESSURING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO RELEASE AN ABNORMALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INTO THE ECONOMY PARTICULARLY DURING FINANCIAL CRISES. RATHER, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD ENCOURAGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPLY CREDIT IN A SUSTAINED MANNER - NOT IN AN ABNORMAL MANNER -AND IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS GROWTH.ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE PRESENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY ANALYSING THE EFFECT OF ABNORMAL INCREASE IN CREDIT SUPPLY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY CONTEXT.
627	MANY STUDIES OF CULTIVATED LAND USE HAVE FOCUSED ON EVALUATING LAND QUALITY. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES RARELY COMPARE CULTIVATED LAND QUALITY (CLQ) BETWEEN MODERN AGRICULTURAL AREAS (MA) AND TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS (TA). THUS, POLICYMAKERS SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES UTILIZING EXISTING CLQ THEORIES IN CLQ IMPROVEMENT, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING THE TRANSFORMATION FROM TRADITIONAL TO MODERN AGRICULTURE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK TO COMPARE THE CLQ IN MA AND TA FROM THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVES OF FERTILITY, PROJECT, LANDSCAPE, AND ECOLOGY. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN FUJIN CITY, HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE, NORTHEAST CHINA. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPREHENSIVE CLQ IN MA IS BETTER THAN THAT IN TA, BUT INDIVIDUAL CULTIVATED LAND QUALITY RESULTS ARE NOT THE SAME AS COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY. SPECIFICALLY, PROJECT, LANDSCAPE, AND ECOLOGY QUALITY IN MA ARE BETTER THAN IN TA. HOWEVER, FERTILITY QUALITY IN MA IS STILL WORSE. MOREOVER, THE CLQ IN MA TENDS TO BE MORE CONSISTENT IN A SMALL RANGE, WHILE THE SPATIAL PATTERN OF CLQ IN TA IS DISORDERED. WE THEN ARGUE THAT THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT MODES AND AGRARIAN PROPERTY SYSTEMS BETWEEN MA AND TA. BASED ON OUR FINDINGS, FOUR SUGGESTIONS WERE GENERATED TO IMPROVE CLQ. OVERALL, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A NEW COMPREHENSIVE INSIGHT FOR UNDERSTANDING CLQ, AND THE FRAMEWORK, METHOD, AND FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CAN HELP INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLQ IMPROVEMENTS.
628	SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS COMMONLY DESCRIBED AS AN EPIDEMIC IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (CAR) AND OTHER CONFLICT SETTINGS. IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE LAUNCHED MAJOR EFFORTS TO COMBAT SEXUAL VIOLENCE, INCLUDING THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF SEXUAL CRIMES AND OFFENCES BY THE ORDINARY JUSTICE SYSTEM, THE SPECIAL CRIMINAL COURT IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. YET, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE EFFORTS ARE PERCEIVED AMONG THE POPULATION AND ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AT REDUCING EXPOSURE IN A CONTEXT OF ONGOING VIOLENCE. THIS ARTICLE BUILDS ON A UNIQUE SERIES OF FOUR SURVEYS CONDUCTED AT SIX-MONTH INTERVALS BETWEEN 2017 AND 2018 WITH A TOTAL OF 25,143 RANDOMLY SELECTED ADULTS. IT ASSESSES THE MAGNITUDE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SHOWS THAT RESPONDENTS POSITIVELY PERCEIVE EFFORTS TO COMBAT SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND INCREASINGLY UNDERSTAND AND TRUST THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. DISCLOSURE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS INCREASING, BUT ONLY ONE IN FIVE VICTIMS FILES A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH SECURITY AND JUSTICE ACTORS. FACTORS UNDERMINING DISCLOSING OR FILING OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE WIDESPREAD EVENTS INCLUDE FEAR OF RETALIATION, RETRAUMATIZATION, AND STIGMATIZATION. INVESTIGATING SEXUAL CRIMES IN A CONTEXT OF INSECURITY IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND THE WORK OF THE VARIOUS COURTS IS HINDERED BY PRACTICAL, PROCEDURAL, AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES DETAILED IN THIS ARTICLE, AS WELL AS THE NEED TO COORDINATE PROSECUTORIAL STRATEGIES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO BUILD CAPACITY AND TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE AND COMPASSIONATE TREATMENT TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED. MONITORING PERCEPTION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE EFFORTS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ENDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND TO PEACE.
629	ONE WAY OF IMPROVING NATURAL RESOURCE REGIMES WOULD BE THROUGH A MORE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT IDENTIFICATION OF RIGHTS-HOLDERS, WITH MORE EXPLICIT ATTENTION FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND OTHER LOCAL NON INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES. THIS ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED WITH A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROTECTED AREAS LEGISLATION IN PERU, FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT TO CONSULTATION PRIOR TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROTECTED AREA, AND THE RIGHTS TO USE AND SUSTAINABLY MANAGE NATURAL RESOURCES WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS. ON THE BASIS OF BOTH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND EMPIRICAL DATA, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT LIMITING SUBSISTENCE-RELATED RIGHTS IN PROTECTED AREAS TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES COULD ENDANGER THE ENJOYMENT OF THE RIGHT TO FOOD OF THE LOCAL NON-INDIGENOUS POPULATION. MOREOVER, THE EXTENSION OF CERTAIN HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OR MOSTLY GRANTED TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO THE BROADER LOCAL POPULATION AFFECTED BY A PROTECTED AREA, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.
630	AT THE CORE OF THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO COMBAT CORRUPTION IS THE 'HOME COUNTRY' ANTI-CORRUPTION LEGISLATION THAT PENALISES COMPANIES IN THEIR HOME STATE FOR ENGAGING IN CORRUPTION EXTRATERRITORIALLY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN BRIBERY LEGISLATION TO THE CHINESE TAX CONTEXT. THE LEGAL TEST FOR AUSTRALIA'S EXTRATERRITORIAL BRIBERY LEGISLATION RESTS HEAVILY UPON A FINDING THAT AN EXTRA-LEGAL ADVANTAGE GAINED, OR BENEFIT PROVIDED, IS 'ILLEGITIMATE'. WHILE THE ASSUMPTION THAT FORMAL LAW IS ALIGNED WITH LEGITIMACY IS REASONABLE IN MANY CONTEXTS AND PRACTICAL IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW, A FOCUS ON LEGALITY DOES NOT ALIGN WELL WITH LEGITIMACY IN CHINA. IN CHINA, VAGUE LAWS ARE CREATED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE FLEXIBLE AND LOCALISED IMPLEMENTATION. IN A SYSTEM WHERE FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDERDEVELOPED, INFORMAL RULES ARE SIGNIFICANT IN GUIDING THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. AUSTRALIA OUGHT TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHINA'S CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING ITS EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION. UPON DOING SO, IT WILL BECOME APPARENT THAT A STRICTLY 'LEGAL' ANALYSIS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE YARDSTICK BY WHICH TO GAUGE THE LEGITIMACY OF AN OFFICIAL'S BEHAVIOUR.
631	OBJECTIVESAS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES INCREASES, SO DOES THE AMOUNT OF HOUSEHOLD-GENERATED SHARP WASTE, AND INCORRECT SHARP DISPOSAL METHODS CAN EXPOSE THE PUBLIC TO NEEDLE STICK INJURIES THIS SYSTEMATIC STUDY ASSESSES THE RELEVANT FACTORS AND CURRENT SITUATION OF THE DISPOSAL OF SHARP WASTE IN DIABETES PATIENTS.METHODSIN THIS REVIEW, OUR STUDY COMPREHENSIVELY SEARCHED PUBMED, MEDLINE, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND CHINA BIOMEDICAL, WANFANG, AND CNKI FOR THE CONCEPTS OF "SHARPS WASTE DISPOSAL" AND "DIABETES".RESULTIN 12 IDENTIFIED ARTICLES, THERE ARE 4155 PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THAT DIABETIC PATIENTS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS SHARPS WASTE DISPOSAL, BUT LACK KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF SHARPS WASTE DISPOSAL, AND NEED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE RATE OF PROPER WASTE DISPOSAL BEFORE AND DURING USE. PATIENTS WITH LONGER DURATION OF DIABETES ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN INAPPROPRIATE SHARPS DISPOSAL BEHAVIORS.CONCLUSIONSTHE FINDINGS EMPHASIZE THAT THE MAJORITY OF DIABETIC PATIENTS ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE SHARPS SAFELY, SO MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO FIND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SHARPS WASTE DISPOSAL IN DIABETIC PATIENTS AND TO FOCUS ON SHARPS WASTE DISPOSAL BEHAVIORS IN PATIENTS WITH LONGER DURATION OF DISEASE IN FUTURE CLINICAL PRACTICE.TRIAL REGISTRATIONPROSPERO ID.

632	COVERING A CENTRAL THEME IN CORPORATE LAW DEVELOPMENT, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE PRAGMATIC UTILITY OF THE COMMON-LAW-ORIGINATED DUTY OF LOYALTY OF COMPANY DIRECTORS IN THE CIVIL LAW CONTEXT OF CHINA. THE RECEPTION OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION IN A HOST ENVIRONMENT REMAINS A CONTENTIOUS THEME, AND IT SEEMS TO BE AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO STUDY RELEVANT CASES THAT HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED SINCE CHINA'S STATUTORY INAUGURATION OF THE DIRECTORS' DUTY OF LOYALTY IN 2005, IN THE SENSE THAT MORE THAN 10 YEARS OF PRACTICE HAS RESULTED IN AMPLE EVIDENCE ON THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF THIS TRANSPLANTED DUTY. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF 526 CASES ON THE BASIS OF EIGHT ATTRIBUTES, WE DISCOVERED SOME COMMENDABLE FEATURES, INCLUDING INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LAW AND A DIFFERENTIATION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DIRECTORS' DUTIES OF LOYALTY. MEANWHILE, THE SELECTIVE ADOPTION NORM CUSTOMARY TO CHINESE CULTURE HAS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT COMPROMISED THE INTENDED GOALS OF GREATER LEGISLATIVE CLARITY, JUDICIAL CONSISTENCY AND IN TURN BALANCED AND SUSTAINABLE BUSINESSES, DEMONSTRATED IN SEVERAL INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN TRANSPLANTED DUTIES AND DOMESTIC LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. RESHAPING THE CONVENTIONAL TRANSPLANTATION IDEAL THAT COMMERCIAL LAWS ARE EASILY TRANSFERABLE, THE PAPER SUGGESTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A BROAD COLLATERAL REGIME FOR GREATER CONGRUENCE BETWEEN LAWS AND EXISTING INSTITUTIONS.
633	IN RECENT DECADES, THE RULE OF LAW HAS NOT BEEN COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH AFGHANISTAN. INSTEAD, ITS POLITICS HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY TO BE FRAMED IN TERMS OF LAWLESSNESS AND UNGOVERNABILITY. BUT THIS TROPE DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO AFGHANISTAN'S LONGER HISTORY OF STATEHOOD OR EXPERIENCES OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING. OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, AFGHAN LEADERS DRAFTED SEVEN CONSTITUTIONS (IN 1923, 1931, 1964, 1976, 1980, 1987, AND 1990). THESE CONSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED LEADERS' ATTEMPTS TO ASSERT THEIR LEGITIMACY AND ENFORCE THEIR VISION OF AN AFGHAN NATION-STATE. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS FRESH LIGHT ON AFGHAN ELITES' TOP-DOWN FRAMING OF AFGHAN NATIONAL IDENTITY THROUGH ETHNOLINGUISM, EXPLORING THE LEGALIZATION OF PASHTO AS BOTH AN OFFICIAL AND NATIONAL LANGUAGE IN AFGHANISTAN'S CONSTITUTIONS. REFORMERS INTENDED PASHTO TO TRANSGRESS COMMUNITY, KINSHIP, AND REGIONAL BOUNDARIES AND ACT AS A SOURCE OF UNITY (THOUGH ONE IN WHICH ETHNOLINGUISTIC MINORITIES HAD LITTLE SAY). TRACING AFGHANISTAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY FROM 1923-90, THIS ARTICLE REVEALS LANGUAGE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL ARENA FOR DEBATING AFGHAN MODERNITY AND IDENTITY. AS SUCH, THIS ARTICLE INTEGRATES AFGHANISTAN INTO LEGAL HISTORIES OF SOUTH ASIA WHILE EMPHASIZING HOW AFGHAN CONSTITUTIONALISTS ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS OF LAW-MAKING AS A MEANS OF EXPRESSING AFGHANISTAN'S OWN INDEPENDENCE AND IDEAS OF MODERNITY.
634	THE CURRENT ARTICLE BRIEFLY PRESENTS A PILOT MACHINE-LEARNING EXPERIMENT ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL TEXTS ADDRESSED TO LAY READERS WITH THE USE OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE AS A BASELINE AND FASTTEXT MODELS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A HAND-CRAFTED CORPUS WAS USED, CREATED BY THE EXPERTS OF THE NATIONAL TAX AND CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATION OF HUNGARY UNDER THE OFFICE'S PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY PROGRAMME. THE CORPUS CONTAINED SENTENCES THAT WERE PARAPHRASED OR COMPLETELY REWRITTEN BY THE EXPERTS TO MAKE THEM MORE READABLE FOR LAY PEOPLE, AS WELL THEIR ORIGINAL COUNTER PAIRS. THE AIM WAS TO AUTOMATICALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE TWO CLASSES BY USING SUPERVISED MACHINE-LEARNING ALGORITHMS. IF SUCCESSFUL, SUCH A MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED MODEL COULD BE USED TO DRAW THE ATTENTION OF EXPERTS INVOLVED IN MAKING THE TEXTS OF OFFICIAL BODIES MORE COMPREHENSIBLE TO THE AVERAGE READER TO THE POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC POINTS OF A TEXT. THEREFORE, THE PROCESS OF REPHRASING SUCH TEXTS COULD BE SPED UP DRASTICALLY. SUCH A REPHRASING (CONSIDERING, ABOVE ALL, THE NEEDS OF THE AVERAGE READER) CAN IMPROVE THE OVERALL COMPREHENSIBILITY OF OFFICIAL (MOSTLY LEGAL) TEXTS, AND THEREFORE SUPPORTS ACCESS TO JUSTICE, THE TRANSPARENCY OF GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, IMPROVES THE RULE OF LAW IN A GIVEN COUNTRY.
635	THIS PAPER REPORTS ON THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE EP-POLAND CORPUS AND ON THE FIRST EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS THEREOF. THIS EXTENSIVE BIDIRECTIONAL ENGLISH-POLISH CORPUS OF ORIGINAL PARLIAMENTARY CONTRIBUTIONS PAIRED WITH PROFESSIONAL SIMULTANEOUS INTERPRETATIONS INCLUDES 11 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT DEBATES HELD BETWEEN JANUARY 2016 AND FEBRUARY 2020. THE MAIN TOPIC OF THESE DEBATES IS THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS TRIGGERED BY THE LAW AND JUSTICE GOVERNMENT IN POLAND. THE CORPUS CONTAINS OVER 157,000 TOKENS AND ABOUT 20 H 45 MIN OF RECORDINGS, COUNTING BOTH SOURCE AND TARGET TEXTS. THE TWO INTERPRETING DIRECTIONS (ENGLISH-POLISH AND POLISH-ENGLISH) ARE REPRESENTED ALMOST EVENLY. THE ANNOTATION OF THE CORPUS COMPLETED SO FAR INCLUDES MARK-UP INFORMATION, POS TAGGING, LABELLING DISFLUENCY PHENOMENA, AND ALL FORMS OF EXPLICITATING SHIFTS. MANUAL ANNOTATION FOR PERSONAL DEIXIS IS IN PROGRESS. AN ADDITIONAL INTERESTING FEATURE IS THE SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION PERFORMED EMPLOYING THE X-VECTOR METHOD, WHICH ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY 36 INTERPRETERS. WE BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE EXISTING INTERPRETING CORPORA. THEN WE PROCEED TO EXPLAIN THE DESIGN FEATURES OF THE EP-POLAND AND REPORT ON TWO COMPLETED EMPIRICAL STUDIES ANALYSING IDIOSYNCRATIC INTERPRETING BEHAVIOUR. WE CONCLUDE BY OUTLINING FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS AND OFFERING SOME REMARKS ON CORPUS SIGNIFICANCE AND ITS LIMITATIONS.
636	HONG KONG, AS A FORMER COLONY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, IS CHARACTERISED AS A HYBRID OF EAST AND WEST. ITS COLONIAL HISTORY IS COMMONLY SEEN AS ESTABLISHING MANY POSITIVE ASPECTS OF HONG KONG AND SHAPING GOOD QUALITIES OF ITS PEOPLE, SUCH AS THE VALUE OF RULE OF LAW, FREE SPEECH, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, AND FLUENCY IN ENGLISH. YET THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN BOTH HONG KONG AND CHINA SHARE HAN CHINESE ETHNICITY, WHICH HAS BEEN USED BY BOTH THE CHINESE AND HONG KONG GOVERNMENTS TO PROMOTE A BLOOD-BASED IDEA OF CHINESE IDENTITY FOR DECADES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES "CHINESENESS", OR CHINESE IDENTITY, AS PROMOTED BY THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT. IT FIRST EXPLORES THE CONCEPT OF CHINESENESS, ELABORATING ON A BLOOD-BASED VIEW THAT CONNECTS WITH ETHNIC-NATIONALISM, IN CONTRAST WITH A PLURALISTIC VIEW OF IDENTITY IN THE HONG KONG CONTEXT. THE PAPER THEN EXAMINES HOW HONG KONG GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PROMOTE CHINESENESS THROUGH MAJOR OUTLETS, ON GOVERNMENT WEBSITES AND IN SPEECHES CAPTURED IN MEDIA. AS WE SHOW, THE GOVERNMENT TENDS TO ADVOCATE A BLOOD-BASED VIEW OF CHINESENESS AKIN TO ETHNIC-NATIONALISM. A MORE INCLUSIVE AND PLURALISTIC VIEW WHICH RECOGNISES THE DYNAMIC NATURE AND MULTIPLE VISIONS OF CHINESE IDENTITY BETTER FITS HONG KONG'S MULTICULTURAL CONTEXT.
637	DURING THE LAST YEARS, SOCIETY HAS WITNESSED SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN CONSIDERABLE PROPORTIONS, WHICH RESPOND TO THE GREATER COMPLEXITY EXISTING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE NEED FOR CHANGE DUE TO THIS GLOBALIZED WORLD OF CONSTANT DYNAMISM AND PRECISELY TO SAFEGUARD THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE, FACING A NEW PARADIGM IN THE JURISDICTIONAL ORGANIZATION, BEING ITS MAIN AUTHORS IN A PROCESS, THE JUDGES AND PROCEDURAL SUBJECTS TO WHOM WE WILL CALL THE TRIAD OF LAW. THE ROLE OF THE LAWYER IN SOCIETY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN DONE FROM A PERSPECTIVE AS AN ADVOCATE OR ADVISER TO HIS CLIENT. THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS A PROFESSION HAS BEEN JUSTIFIED, CONSIDERING IT AN ACTIVITY AIMED AT GUARANTEEING THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH A TECHNICAL DEFENSE AND NOT MERE FORMALITY IN THIS WORLD WHERE TECHNOLOGY AND PLURALITY OF LANGUAGES PREVAIL, WHERE THEY MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO SOLVE CONFLICTS BY THE EXTRAPENALES MECHANISMS OR ALTERNATIVE EXITS TO THE LITIGATION, IN ALL THE SUBJECTS BY MEANS OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE ORALITY, AS IT PROCLAIMS THE ECUADORIAN CONSTITUTIONAL EMPIRE. FROM THE FOREGOING, THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS PROTECTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT INTRINSICALLY ATTEND THE MAN IN FRONT OF THE STATE POWER, BEING NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE EXPERTISE IN THE PUBLIC HEARINGS.
638	RESETTLEMENT RESULTING FROM DAM CONSTRUCTION HAS RAISED SEVERAL CONCERNS DUE TO THE NEGATIVE AFTERMATH IMPACTS. IN GHANA, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THREE HYDROELECTRIC DAMS RESULTED IN LARGE-SCALE RESETTLEMENTS. GIVEN THE LITTLE EXPERIENCE THAT GHANA HAS IN RESETTLEMENTS, IT IS NECESSARY FOR A ROBUST MONITORING STRUCTURE FOR RESETTLEMENTS. HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LAST RESETTLEMENT UNDERTAKEN FOR THE BUI DAM PROJECT. THIS PAPER AIMS AT DEVELOPING AN ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES ON CUSTOMARY LANDS FROM A GOOD GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE. BASED ON FOUR GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES, TRANSPARENCY, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND INCLUSIVENESS, EQUITY AND RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY, A GOOD GOVERNANCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK IS BUILT AND APPLIED TO THE BUI DAM PROJECT USING A CASE STUDY APPROACH. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION WITH THE KEY ACTORS OF THE RESETTLEMENT PROJECT. IT WAS FIRST FOUND THAT THE PLANNING STAGE OF THE RESETTLEMENT CAME OUT WITH A ROBUST PLAN THAT WAS TO PREVENT THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE AFFECTED PERSONS. HOWEVER, IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESETTLEMENT, NOT ALL GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES WERE ADHERED TO. IN CONCLUSION, IT WAS FOUND THAT BY DECONSTRUCTING THE RESETTLEMENT PROCESS WITH A GOOD GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, THE PROBLEMATIC AREAS OF THE RESETTLEMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PHASES.
639	THIS ESSAY'S STARTING POINT IS SCHOLARSHIP DESCRIBING THE STATE PRACTICE OF USING LAW AS A TOOL OF MASS ATROCITY, AND THE PART PLAYED BY LIBERAL TRIALS IN OBSCURING THIS 'DARK SIDE' OF LEGALITY. IT ASKS WHETHER LAW'S COMPLICITY WITH ATROCITY IS ONLY VISIBLE WHEN ONE STEPS OUTSIDE THE LEGAL ARENA, OR WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN LIBERAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO DEVELOP WHAT THE ESSAY CALLS SELF-REFLEXIVE LAW: RULE OF LAW MECHANISMS THAT EXPOSE THE PART PLAYED BY LAW IN VIOLENCE. TO EXPLORE THIS QUESTION, THE ESSAY OFFERS A CLOSE READING OF A LAWSUIT IN WHICH THE KEY PART PLAYED BY LAW IN ATROCITY WAS MADE EXPLICIT AT TRIAL: A CLASS ACTION FILED IN 1986 UNDER THE ALIEN TORT STATUTE ON BEHALF OF 10,000 PHILIPPINE VICTIMS OF TORTURE AND OTHER GROSS ABUSES AGAINST FERDINAND MARCOS. STUDYING THE REPRESENTATIONS OF VIOLENCE PRODUCED BY THE VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS IN THE LITIGATION, THE ESSAY ATTEMPTS TO ELICIT SOME OF THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO A SELF-REFLEXIVE LAW. THE ESSAY OFFERS A DISTINCT VERSION OF 'MINOR JURISPRUDENCE,' RECOVERING 'MINOR' PRACTICES WITHIN ORTHODOX LAW ITSELF, NAMELY ORAL TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND ATTEMPTING TO DERIVE INSIGHTS FROM THE MINOR IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO LEGAL DESIGN.
640	THE SUDDEN RISE OF THIS RADICAL TERROR GROUP CALLING THEMSELVES THE ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND THE LEVANT (ISIL) AND THE BRAZEN SHOW OF DECAPITATION OF THEIR CAPTIVES HAVE SENT SHOCK WAVES ACROSS THE GLOBE. THIS PROMPTED THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL TO ADOPT RESOLUTION 2178 CALLING FOR ITS MEMBERS TO TAKE PREVENTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF THIS RADICAL IDEOLOGY PROPAGATED BY ISIL. MALAYSIA IN RESPONDING TO THIS CALL, HAS PASSED AND ENACTED THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT, 2015 (POTA) DESPITE RECEIVING MUCH CRITICISM THAT POTA HAS ERODED FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR, THE RIGHT TO ONE'S LIBERTY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN BALANCING BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITY AND PERSONAL LIBERTY WHEN CRAFTING POTA. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT EQUILIBRIUM IS HARD TO ACHIEVE BETWEEN THE TWO COMPETING RIGHTS AND THUS HAS BECOME DISPROPORTIONATE BY LOOKING AT THE POTA ITSELF. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES MALAYSIA'S COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY PRIORITISES NATIONAL SECURITY OVER BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH CLEARLY IS ABHORRENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT IN FACT, THE THREAT POSED BY TERRORISM COULD HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIGHT TERRORISM AS THERE ARE MANY OTHER THREATS TO LIFE WHICH CALL FOR MORE ATTENTION THAN THE THREAT OF TERRORISM ITSELF.
641	NO DEFINITION OF "JURIST" CAN BE FOUND IN THE USUAL LEGAL SUPPORT DOCUMENTS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHOW THAT THE CONTEMPORARY JURIST IS NO LONGER A CLASSICAL DOGMATIST IN THE KELSENIAN SENSE, BUT RATHER A PERSON WHO IS CONSCIOUS OF PLAYING A ROLE IN SOCIETY. THE METHOD USED IN THE PURE THEORY OF LAW, SIMPLISTIC, MONOLITHIC AND LINEAR, IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT TO REFLECT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LAW IN A "POST-MODERN"PERIOD DEFINED BY MULTIPLE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL REGULATION. THE POSTULATE THAT THE SCIENCE OF LAW REMAINS AXIOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL HAS OFTEN BEEN CRITICIZED, AND TODAY IS COMPLETELY OUTMODED. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, THE LAW IS PROGRESSING BECAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES REQUIRE A CONSTANT ADAPTATION OF LEGAL RULES TO MATCH CITIZENS' ASPIRATIONS. THE ULTIMATE AIMS OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BECOME THE TOOLS USED TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF THE LAW. FOR THIS REASON, THE USE OF A SYNCRETIC METHODOLOGY, A COMBINATION OF CLASSICAL AND ETHICAL DOGMATICS, OFFERS AN INTERESTING APPROACH IN THE TASK OF DEFINING THE NOTION OF JURIST. A JURIST, FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, IS SOMEONE WHO IS AXIOLOGICALLY AWARE AS A DOGMATIST THAT HUMANITY REMAINS THE FINAL HORIZON FOR HIS OR HER WORK.
642	STATEBUILDING AFTER CONFLICT OFTEN ENTAILS LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING MEASURES. THE END OF THE UN MISSION IN POST-CONFLICT TIMOR-LESTE IN DECEMBER 2012 PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE STATEBUILDING IN PRACTICE. THE LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING AGENDA HAS MET WITH STIFF ACADEMIC RESISTANCEMAINLY FROM THE CRITICAL THEORIST CAMPAND IS QUESTIONED AS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF ...STATEBUILDING SUCCESS. WE DEPLOY INSTEAD THE GOOD GOVERNANCE (GG) AGENDA AS A HYBRID LOCAL-LIBERAL GUIDE. DRAWING ON FIELD WORK, INTERVIEWS, AND SECONDARY DOCUMENTS, WE INVESTIGATE WHAT WE SEE AS FOUR KEY, INTERTWINED AND OVERLAPPING ASPECTS OF GG: STATE CAPACITY INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE BUREAUCRACY, PARTICIPATION AND THE ENGAGEMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY, INSTITUTION BUILDING AND RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL AND TRANSPARENCY. WE NOTE GG PROVIDES A USEFUL POLICY HEURISTIC, WHILE ABSTRACT ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING MODELS, WHICH AVOID THE COMPLEXITIES OF MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT ISSUES, THE TIME TAKEN TO DEVELOP INSTITUTIONS, AND HISTORICAL AND CONTEXTUAL ENVIRONMENTS OF COUNTRIES, ARE LIKELY TO FACE SEVERE PROBLEMS. NEW STATES MAY BE DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL FORCES TO MAINTAIN MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE. THE REVERSIBILITY AND UNCERTAINTY OF STATEBUILDING AND THE DECADES-LONG COMMITMENT NEEDED BY INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES ARE NOTED. COPYRIGHT (C) 2014 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
643	THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS TRULY CAN MASTER THEIR LIBERTY IS A QUESTION THAT INFILTRATES THE ENTIRE SHAKESPEAREAN CORPUS. IT IS THROUGH A SERIES OF FRAUGHT SOCIO-LEGAL CONFLICTS THAT SHAKESPEARE'S AUDIENCES ARE TREATED TO THE COMEDIES AND TRAGEDIES OF EUROPE'S TRANSITION INTO EARLY-MODERNITY. SOCIO-LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS FUEL SHAKESPEARE'S PLOTS AND HIS CHARACTERS PRESENT CHALLENGES TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE READER THINKS ABOUT LAW AND LEGAL PROCESS. IN REALITY IS "LAW'' JUST THE WILL OF WHOEVER HAS THE MOST POWER? DOES EQUALITY ONLY EXIST FOR THOSE BORN INTO THE HIGHEST SOCIAL SUBSTRATUM? IS THE RULE OF LAW REALLY AS UNIVERSAL AS IT SEEMS? BY INVESTIGATING THESE QUESTIONS USING FOUR OF SHAKESPEARE'S APPARENTLY APOLITICAL PLAYS, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN SOCIO-LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS AS A WAY OF SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE DAY-TO-DAY REALITIES OF RENAISSANCE ENGLAND, SOMETHING THAT MORE TRADITIONAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS YET TO PURSUE. PART ONE EXAMINES MARRIAGE, CLASS CONFLICT AND LEGAL PARTICIPATION IN THE COMEDY OF ERRORS. PART TWO LOOKS AT THE NATIVE-ALIEN DIVISION AND LEGAL OBLIGATION IN THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. PART THREE ASSESSES THE NATURE OF EMPIRE AND THE SECURITY OF PRESCRIBED KNOWLEDGE IN CYMBE-LINE. FINALLY, PART FOUR PROBES WIDER ISSUES OF SOCIAL CONTROL AND SUBORDINATION IN THE TEMPEST.
644	GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IS NEITHER DEMOCRATIC NOR ENTIRELY UNDEMOCRATIC. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) FORMALLY ALL MEMBER-STATES HAVE EQUAL POWER OVER DECISION MAKING. THE WTO'S DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY (DSB) ACTS TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW OVER SO-CALLED POWER POLITICS. THE WTO'S SECRETARIAT ORGANIZES REGULAR MEETINGS WITH CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, AND RESOURCES ARE SPENT ON FACILITATING TRANSPARENCY, INCLUDING PUTTING A VAST AMOUNT OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION ONLINE. HOWEVER, THERE IS LARGE POWER ASYMMETRY BETWEEN WTO MEMBER-STATES. THIS ARTICLE SIDESTEPS THE CLASSIC RESPONSE TO SUCH DILEMMAS, IN WHICH DEBATE HINGES ON HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE THE INSTITUTION IS ABLE TO AMELIORATE REALPOLITIK, AND CONSIDERS THE ROLE THE VESTIGES OF "DEMOCRACY" PLAY IN THE WTO. DRAWING ON THE WORK OF ERNESTO LACLAU AND CHANTAL MOUFFE, AMONG OTHERS, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE DISCOURSE OF DEMOCRACY EMBODIED IN THE WTO EXPRESSES THE WIDER PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE INSTITUTION IS LEGITIMATED AS THE BODY OF GLOBAL TRADE POLITICS. THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING NOT ONLY HOW GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IS DISCURSIVELY FORMED BUT ALSO WHETHER CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS CRITIQUING THE WTO THREATEN THE WTO OR, BY ACCEPTING THE PREMISE OF ITS PREDOMINANCE IN GLOBAL TRADE POLITICS, EFFECTIVELY STRENGTHEN IT.
645	HOW DOES THE QUALITY OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW INFLUENCE INTERNATIONAL TRADE? ANDERSON AND MARCOUILLER ARGUE THAT BAD INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN THE IMPORTER'S COUNTRY DETER INTERNATIONAL TRADE BECAUSE THEY ENABLE ECONOMIC PREDATORS TO STEAL AND EXTORT RENTS AT THE IMPORTER'S BORDER. WE COMPLEMENT THIS RESEARCH AND SHOW HOW GOOD INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN THE EXPORTER'S COUNTRY ENHANCE INTERNATIONAL TRADE, IN PARTICULAR, TRADE IN COMPLEX PRODUCTS WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE DIFFICULT TO FULLY SPECIFY IN A CONTRACT. WE ARGUE THAT BOTH EXPORTER AND IMPORTER INSTITUTIONS AFFECT INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC TRANSACTION COSTS IN COMPLEX AND SIMPLE PRODUCT MARKETS. INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION COSTS ARE A PART OF THE COSTS OF TRADE. DOMESTIC TRANSACTION COSTS AFFECT COMPLEX AND SIMPLE PRODUCTS DIFFERENTLY, THEREBY CHANGING A COUNTRY'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN PRODUCING SUCH GOODS. WE FIND AMPLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THESE PREDICTIONS: COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GOOD INSTITUTIONS TEND TO EXPORT MORE COMPLEX PRODUCTS AND IMPORT MORE SIMPLE PRODUCTS. FURTHERMORE, INSTITUTIONS HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE ON TRADE VIA PRODUCTION COSTS (COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE) THAN THROUGH INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS COSTS. INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SEEM TO OPERATE AS SUBSTITUTES FOR DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS, BECAUSE GOOD DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LESS IMPORTANT FOR PROMOTING EXPORTS IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE SIGNED THE NEW YORK CONVENTION.
646	TRADE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND (NZ) PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE ONGOING CLASH BETWEEN EU AND NEW WORLD ( UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA), CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NZ ETC.) COUNTRIES OVER GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS (GIS). SINCE THE EU-CANADA NEGOTIATIONS, THE EU HAS INCREASED ITS GI DEMANDS AND THE AUSTRALIA AND NZ NEGOTIATIONS PROVIDE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THESE. NZ HAS AGREED TO PRIVILEGES THAT EXCEED THOSE IN THE AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (TRIPS) AND HAS FEWER SAFEGUARDS FOR NZ PRODUCERS THAN WERE ACHIEVED IN CANADA. THE EU'S GI DEMANDS TO AUSTRALIA ARE SCRUTINIZED IN TERMS OF COMPETITION, RULE OF LAW AND CONSUMER INFORMATION CRITERIA, PROVIDING A BASIS FOR CONSIDERING HOW AUSTRALIA SHOULD RESPOND. A PARTICULAR FOCUS IS THE PROBLEMATIC ISSUES RAISED IN THE DEMAND THAT SPECIFIC GI NAMES BE LISTED IN THE TREATY WITHOUT PROPER REVIEW AND OPPOSITION PROCEDURES. QUESTIONS ARE ALSO RAISED ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF EU GI LABELS AND THE RELATIVE MERIT OF EU GI POLICY COMPARED TO CERTIFICATION MARK GIS TO PROMOTE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ON THIS BASIS IT IS SUGGESTED THAT AUSTRALIA SHOULD REJECT A NUMBER OF THE EU'S GI DEMANDS AS THESE LEAD TO APPROVING PRODUCT LABELS WHICH ARE DECEPTIVE FOR CONSUMERS.
647	THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE CHAMELEON CONCEPT OF LAWFARE AND ITS IMPACT ON LEGAL SYSTEMS AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL, FOCUSING ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ITS (IM)BOUNDARIES AND TRANSDISCIPLINARITY. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON A KALEIDOSCOPE OF FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF JUSTICE, INCLUDING THE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES USED IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, IN CIVIL OR MILITARY CONFLICTS, IN THE ABUSE OF LEGAL PROCEDURES, AND IN THE MANIPULATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE ILLEGAL ENDS, IN THE REGULATION OF LAW AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL AND NATIONALLY, HIGHLIGHTING THE DIFFERENT FORMS THIS PHENOMENON CAN TAKE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LIMITS OF THE LAW, IN THE SENSE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND MORAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABUSIVE USE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE BASED ON THE FINDING THAT CLEARER REGULATIONS ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND TO PREVENT LEGAL ABUSES, A FACT THAT REQUIRES A SERIES OF FUTURE RESEARCH, ESTABLISHING THE CONDITIONS THAT MARK THE TRANSITION FROM LEGAL TO ILLEGAL. THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED USING THE METHOD OF TRANSDISCIPLINARY INTROSPECTION, BASED ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA FROM SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, BOOKS, DOCUMENTS, AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS.
648	WE ANALYZE THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INNOVATION AND THE CREATIVE ECONOMY. ORDINARILY THE WORD 'ENTREPRENEURSHIP' IMPLIES FINANCIAL (OR COMMERCIAL) ENTERPRISE UNDERTAKEN WITH A PROFIT MOTIVE WHEREAS THE PHRASE 'SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP' IMPLIES, ON AVERAGE, A NON-PROFIT ACTIVITY UNDERTAKEN TO IMPROVE A PARTICULAR SOCIETAL UNFAVOURABLE CONDITION OR ILL. THE WORD 'INNOVATION' IMPLIES AN IMPROVED OR NEW IDEA, PRODUCT, PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY OR ANY ONE OF THE MYRIAD OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. THE WORD 'CREATIVE' IS PERHAPS THE MOST NEBULOUS AND ACCOMMODATES A VARIETY OF MEANINGS. IN FINANCE AND ECONOMICS, HOWEVER, THE WORD 'CREATIVE' IMPARTS A SPECIFIC MEANING IN THE SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND TRADITIONAL ARTISAN-BASED CRAFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE USE A SAMPLE OF 160 COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD FOR AN EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THESE THREE CONCEPTS. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE CREATIVE ECONOMY VARY SYSTEMATICALLY ACROSS THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES AND THEY ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED. IN TWO SUBSAMPLES, THE CREATIVE ECONOMY IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE-OF-LAW AND MARKET-SIZE. THE RESULTS EXPLAIN MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND SUGGEST THAT THE CREATIVE ECONOMY CAN CHANGE AND DEVELOP OVER TIME AS SOCIETIES BUILD THE INSTITUTIONS FOR FOSTERING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SOCIAL INNOVATION.
649	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE POLITICAL PROJECT OF WEST GERMANY AND THE ROLE OF THE RECHTSSTAAT WITHIN IT. IT SHOWS HOW THE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC DEVELOPED A SPECIFIC READING OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ORDER FOUNDED ON BASIC RIGHTS AS SUPRA-LEGAL VALUES AND JUDICIAL AUTHORITY, WHICH HAD TO BE DEFENDED EVEN AGAINST DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. THIS DID NOT SIGNIFY A DEPARTURE FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY OF THE WEIMAR PERIOD, AS CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS SUCH AS GUSTAV RADBRUCH AND CARLO SCHMID CLAIMED AT THE TIME. INSTEAD, THE DECISIVE INNOVATIONS IN CONSTITUTIONAL THOUGHT STEMMED FROM THE WEIMAR ERA. JUDICIAL REVIEW AND BASIC RIGHTS HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTS IN A POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRUGGLE OVER THE SOCIAL QUESTION AND THE BOUNDARIES OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING IN THE 1920S. THEY HAD BEEN INVOKED BY CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS SUCH AS CARL SCHMITT AND BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A SUBSTANTIAL CRITIQUE MOUNTED BY SOCIAL DEMOCRAT INTERPRETERS OF THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION SUCH AS HERMANN HELLER AND FRANZ NEUMANN. AS SUCH THE RECHTSSTAAT, WHICH IS SO STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RENEWAL OF GERMAN DEMOCRACY, CARRIES WITH IT A TRADITION OF LEGAL THOUGHT WHICH SYSTEMATICALLY AND SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDED JUDICIAL POWER TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND DEMOCRATIC ACTION.
650	CHINA WAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST IMPORTER OF E-WASTE IN THE 2000S, WITH E-WASTE ENTERING THE COUNTRY VIA DIFFERENT PATHWAYS. IT WAS TREATED INFORMALLY BY USING PRIMITIVE TECHNIQUES. SINCE THE 2010S, THE QUANTITIES OF ILLEGAL IMPORTATION HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY DECREASING AS CHINA STARTED TO AMEND AND ENFORCE THE IMPORTATION BAN POLICY. THE AMOUNT OF IMPORTED E-WASTE IS PREDICTED TO DISAPPEAR IN THE COMING DECADES IF CHINA KEEPS TO HER STRINGENT ENFORCEMENTS. BEING A SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (SAR) OF CHINA, HONG KONG (HK) PURSUES AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, RULE OF LAW AND RETAINS A FREE TRADING POLICY. AS SUCH, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF E-WASTE HAS ENTERED HK, AND IS STORED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE NEW TERRITORIES (NT). SOME OF THE E-WASTE HAS BEEN DISMANTLED AND RECYCLED, JEOPARDIZING THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND THE HUMAN HEALTH OF THIS INCREASINGLY AFFLUENT CITY. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE EFFECTS OF THE NEW MOVEMENT OF GLOBAL E-WASTE, TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE SAME MISTAKES MADE IN CHINA ARE BEING REPEATED IN HK, IN PARTICULAR, THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH IMPACTS OF RECYCLING E-WASTE. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THIS DENSELY POPULATED CITY ARE ALSO SUMMARIZED. [GRAPHICS] .
651	BRAZIL HAS BEEN THE LARGEST TROOP CONTRIBUTOR AND PROVIDED ALL FORCE COMMANDERS TO THE UN STABILISATION MISSION IN HAITI (MINUSTAH, 2004-2017). AS THE MILITARY EMBRACED A LEADING ROLE IN UN PEACEKEEPING'S TURN TOWARDS PEACE-ENFORCEMENT, BRAZIL'S GOVERNMENTS HAVE INCREASINGLY RELIED ON SOLDIERS IN PUBLIC SECURITY - OCCASIONALLY EVEN PORTRAYING THESE OPERATIONS AS A SORT OF 'PEACEKEEPING AT HOME'. YET HOW HAS BRAZIL'S PARTICIPATION IN MINUSTAH AFFECTED INTERNAL MILITARY OPERATIONS? I ARGUE THAT NARRATIVES OF THE MILITARY'S EFFECTIVENESS IN HAITI HAVE BEEN USED TO LEGITIMISE THE GROWING SCOPE OF INTERNAL PUBLIC SECURITY MISSIONS. DRAWING ON DATA FROM A QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY, INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH SOLDIERS AND OFFICERS, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE EXPERIENCE IN HAITI HAS FUELLED TROOPS' DEMANDS FOR RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT RESEMBLE THOSE IN UN PEACEKEEPING. GIVEN THE ARMED FORCES' INCREASING BARGAINING POWER IN BRAZIL'S POLITICS, THE MILITARY LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY LOBBY IN FAVOUR OF CHANGING PARTS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERNAL OPERATIONS. LESSONS FROM THE 'ROBUST TURN' HAVE BEEN USED TO PROMOTE MORE COERCIVE INTERNAL MISSIONS OF BRAZIL'S ARMED FORCES. YET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY RECONCILE THE CONTENT OF THE MILITARY'S DEMANDS WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRACY.
652	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, THE ARMED FORCES HAVE INCREASINGLY BEEN ASKED TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE RAMPANT CRIME IN LATIN AMERICA. SINCE THE MILITARIES IN THIS REGION ARE NOT ALWAYS TRAINED TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES WITH RESTRAINT, THE POSSIBILITY OF EXCESSES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IS ALWAYS LATENT. DESPITE THAT PROSPECT, THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR MILITARY COUNTER-CRIME INTERVENTIONS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THE KEY ARGUMENT IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT WHEN THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS MILITARY INTERVENTIONS TO COMBAT CRIME, IT MAKES A COMPARATIVE JUDGMENT CALL ABOUT THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF MILITARY VS. POLICE CONDUCT IN DOMESTIC SECURITY ROLES. LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS HAVE VERY LOW CONFIDENCE IN THE CAPACITY OF THE POLICE TO FIGHT CRIME EFFECTIVELY AND TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY PLACE MORE TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES AS AN INSTITUTION CAPABLE OF PERFORMING EFFECTIVELY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY DEVELOPS THESE ARGUMENTS IN GREATER DETAIL AND THEN TURNS TO RECENT AMERICAS BAROMETER SURVEYS THAT CLEARLY SHOW THAT LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS PLACE MORE TRUST IN THE ARMED FORCES THAN THE POLICE AS AN INSTITUTION CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVELY AND HUMANELY FIGHTING CRIMINAL VIOLENCE.
653	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYSE THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF INTERPRETERS AND INTERPRETING SERVICES IN SWEDEN. AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERPRETERS' WORKING CONDITIONS IS A KEY TO SUCH FACTORS AS THE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES, THE READING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION, THE ORGANISATION OF INTERPRETING SERVICES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERPRETERS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERPRETERS' WORKING CONDITIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING HOW MULTICULTURALISM AND MULTILINGUALISM ARE VIEWED ON A NATIONAL SCALE IN SWEDEN. THIS REVIEW OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF INTERPRETERS IS BASED ON MATERIAL FROM TWO JOINT RESEARCH PROJECTS, WHICH APPEAR TO INDICATE THAT INTERPRETERS AS A GROUP HAVE MUCH TO SAY AND OFTEN REFLECT ON THEIR WORK AND WORKING CONDITIONS. THE INTERPRETERS PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY OFTEN DEMONSTRATED A STRONG COMMITMENT TO PROFESSIONALISM. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, MANY OF THE REFLECTIONS RECORDED FOR THIS STUDY WERE ABOUT THINGS THAT UNDERMINE PROFESSIONALISM: BAD WORKING CONDITIONS, LOW PAY, THE FEELING OF BEING "AS REPLACEABLE AS POTATOES", AND THE FEELING THAT THE SOCIAL STATUS OF INTERPRETERS IS LOW. IN ANALYSING THE CONSEQUENCES OF WORKING CONDITIONS WE HAVE FOUND A TENSION BETWEEN PROFESSIONALISM AND DEPROFESSIONALISATION. THIS TENSION HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND INTEGRATION.
654	WHERE DOES INTERNATIONAL LAW (IL) DRAW ITS AUTHORITY FROM A STILL WEAKLY INSTITUTIONALIZED INTERNATIONAL SCENE DEPRIVED OF THE WARRANTS OF A STATE? TO ADDRESS THIS CLASSICAL DEBATE, THE ARTICLE DRAWS FROM A CASE STUDY ON THE SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE "INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMUNITY" AS IT EMERGED DURING THE 1920S AS PART OF THE RISE OF MULTILATERALISM AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IT FOCUSES ON THE "SITUATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS" OF THE TIME, STARTING WITH THE MULTIPLE AND OFTEN ANTAGONISTIC ROLES THEY PLAY (AS LEGAL ADVISERS, SCHOLARS, JUDGES, DIPLOMATS, POLITICIANS, ETC.) AND THE VARIETY OF INTERESTS AND CAUSES THEY DEFEND (STATES, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS, ETC.) IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. IT ARGUES THIS HETERONOMY OF INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS HELPS UNDERSTAND THE AUTONOMIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. FAR FROM BEING OPPOSED TO ONE ANOTHER IT HAS OFTEN BEEN ASSUMED-REALISM AND IDEALISM, NATIONAL LOYALTY AND INTERNATIONAL LOYALTY, POLITICAL LOGIC AND LEARNED LOGIC-ACTUALLY GAIN WHEN ANALYZED AS VARIOUS MODES OF AFFIRMING A SINGLE CAUSE-THAT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THIS ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE "SITUATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS" AND TO THE WAY THEY MANAGE THEIR VARIOUS ALLEGIANCES ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR THE PARTICULAR VISION OF THE "INTERNATIONAL" AND OF "LAW AND POLITICS" RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE ENCAPSULATED IN THIS EMERGING INTERNATIONAL CORPUS JURIS.
655	WILDLIFE CONSERVATION IN BENDEL STATE IS FACED WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LIMITED LAND AREA AND UNPLANNED LAND USE PRACTICES. FORESTRY VIGOROUSLY COMPETES WITH ALTERNATIVE USES SUCH AS AGRICULTURE, MINERAL EXPLOITATION AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT WHICH LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF NATURAL VEGETATION. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE ALSO ENCROACHED INTO GAME RESERVES, THUS DEPLETING THE WILDLIFE AND THEIR HABITATS. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THE MAJOR LAND USES COMPETING WITH WILDLIFE CONSERVATION IN THE RESERVES AND FORMULATES STRATEGIES FOR EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF WILDLIFE. DATA WERE DERIVED FROM FORESTRY RECORDS AND A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY INVOLVING 300 RESPONDENTS LIVING AT THE PERIPHERY OF GAME RESERVES. THE RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS SHOW THAT GAME RESERVES HAVE BEEN CREATED IN AREAS OF INTNSIVE LAND USE WHICH HOLD LITTLE PROSPECT FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION. IN BENDEL STATE THREE WILDLIFE SPECIES HAVE BECOME EXTINCT AND 18 ARE NOW ENDANGERED IN THE GAME RESERVES. THE STRATEGIES AVAILABLE FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION INCLUDE LAND ZONATION TO ENCOURAGE COMPATIBLE USES, A REVIEW OF FOREST POLICY TO EMPHASIZE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION, ENACTMENT OF STRICT CONSERVATION LAWS, AND RESTRICTION OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION TO A FEW RESERVES TO ENHANCE MANAGEMENT FOR TOURISM. HOWEVER, ITS SUCCESS IN THE STATE DEPENDS ON THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WILDLIFE CONSERVATION IN A DEVELOPING ECONOMY.
656	DISCRETION GIVES DECISION MAKERS CHOICES AS TO HOW RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED, OR HOW OTHER ASPECTS OF STATE LARGESSE OR COERCION ARE DEPLOYED. DISCRETIONARY STATE POWER CHALLENGES ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, FIRST BY TRANSFERRING DECISIONS FROM LEGISLATORS TO DEPARTMENTS, AGENCIES AND STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS AND SECONDLY BY RISKING THE UNIFORM APPLICATION OF KEY FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY NORMS. CONCERNS TO FIND ALTERNATIVE AND DECENTRED FORMS OF REGULATION GAVE RISE TO NEW TYPES OF REGULATION, SOMETIMES LABELED 'REGULATORY CAPITALISM'. REGULATORY CAPITALISM HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLES OF A WIDER RANGE OF ACTORS EXERCISING POWERS AND A WIDER RANGE OF INSTRUMENTS. IT INCLUDES ALSO NEW FORMS OF DISCRETION, FOR EXAMPLE OVER AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING PROCESSES, OVER THE FORMULATION AND DISSEMINATION OF LEAGUE TABLES OR OVER THE USE OF BEHAVIOURAL MEASURES. THIS PAPER TAKES A NOVEL APPROACH BY LINKING AND EXTENDING THE SIGNIFICANT LITERATURE ON THESE CHANGING PATTERNS OF REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE CHANGING MODES OF DEPLOYMENT OF DISCRETION. USING THIS SPECIFIC LENS, WE OBSERVE TWO POTENTIALLY CONTRADICTORY TRENDS: AN INCREASE IN DETERMINING AND STRUCTURING ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION, LEADING TO A MORE TRANSPARENT USE OF DISCRETION; AND THE INCREASED USE OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING PROCESSES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF PRODUCING A LESS TRANSPARENT BLACK BOX SCENARIO.
657	ONE OF THE FAMOUS PUZZLES IN MACROECONOMICS, THE LUCAS (AM ECON REV 80:92-96, 1990) PARADOX ON "WHY DOESN'T CAPITAL FLOW FROM RICH TO POOR COUNTRIES", CONTINUES TO EXIST AND SHAPES CAPITAL FLOWS IN THE MODERN WORLD. THIS PAPER PROVIDES CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE ON THE ROLE OF POLITICO-INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL DETERMINANTS IN GROSS CAPITAL FLOWS DYNAMICS OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2016. USING PANEL REGRESSIONS INCORPORATING COUNTRY FIXED EFFECTS, THE STUDY ARGUES THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY RATHER THAN THE EFFECT OF DIMINISHING RETURNS OF CAPITAL IS A KEY EXPLANATION FOR THE "LUCAS PARADOX". IT CORROBORATES PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS IN DETERMINING GROSS CAPITAL FLOWS DYNAMICS, HIGHLIGHTING THE SYMMETRIC EFFECT. IN CONTRAST, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND CORRUPTION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF GROSS CAPITAL OUTFLOWS DYNAMICS. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER COMES IN IDENTIFYING THE LINK BETWEEN THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND GROSS CAPITAL FLOWS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN GROSS CAPITAL INFLOWS/OUTFLOWS DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY'S LEVEL OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDY SHOWS THE SIGNIFICANCE AND PREDOMINANCE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS VERSUS FINANCIAL MARKETS IN THE DISSEMINATION OF GROSS CAPITAL FLOWS.
658	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW EUROPEAN UNION (EU) PEACEBUILDING IS BEING RECONFIGURED. WHEREAS THE EU WAS ONCE A BULWARK OF LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING, PROMOTING A RULE OF LAW-BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER, IT IS NOW DOWNPLAYING THE GOAL OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND PLACING MILITARY CAPACITY AS CENTRAL FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. SEVERAL WORKS HAVE ANALYSED THESE CHANGES BUT HAVE NOT THEORISED MILITARISM, DESPITE WAR-WAGING AND WAR-PREPARATION HAVE MARKED EU PEACEBUILDING'S DIRECTION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EU PEACEBUILDING CONTINUES TO EXPOSE ELEMENTS OF LIBERAL MILITARISM SINCE ITS ORIGINS BUT IS NOW CHANGING FROM WHAT MABEE AND VUCETIC CALL A NATION-STATIST TO AN EXCEPTIONALIST MILITARISM. THIS SHIFT IMPLIES THAT PEACE HAS CEASED TO BE SERVED BY THE INTERVENTION OF SOVEREIGNTY WITH A DISCOURSE BASED ON THE LINK BETWEEN ORDER, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND IS NOW PREMISED ON THE UPHOLDING OF SOVEREIGNTY, EVEN IF THAT MEANS THE SUSPENSION OF RIGHTS. THE RESEARCH DRAWS ON THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF EU DOCUMENTS AND INTERVIEWS UNDERTAKEN WITH EU AND G5 SAHEL OFFICIALS AND MANAGERS OF EU-FUNDED PEACEBUILDING PROGRAMMES. IT ALSO BRIEFLY ANALYSES THE CASE OF THE SAHEL AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE BUILD-UP OF STATES' MILITARY CAPACITY IS STRENGTHENING STATES' CAPACITY TO OVERRIDE HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPRESSING DISSENT.
659	ARRESTEES HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPLY FOR BAIL AND TO BE RELEASED PENDING THEIR TRIAL, WHERE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IT. THERE IS A PRACTICE OF REQUIRING PEOPLE TO VERIFY THEIR ADDRESSES PRIOR TO BAIL BEING GRANTED, AND THIS IS IMPLEMENTED IN VARIOUS WAYS BY DIFFERENT MAGISTRATES' COURTS; FROM A MAGISTRATE REFUSING TO HEAR A BAIL APPLICATION UNTIL THERE IS A VERIFIED ADDRESS, TO A MAGISTRATE HEARING THE APPLICATION BUT HOLDING THE DECISION OVER UNTIL A VERIFIABLE ADDRESS IS SUPPLIED. THIS PRACTICE IS WIDESPREAD, AND UNFAIRLY PREJUDICES THE HOMELESS AND POOR, WHOSE ADDRESSES ARE DIFFICULT TO VERIFY. IT ALSO MEANS THAT THEIR PRE-TRIAL INCARCERATION MIGHT BE LENGTHIER THAN THEIR SENTENCES. THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT THIS PRACTICE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE CRITERIA, AND THAT ITS CURRENT FORM DOES NOT MEET THIS STANDARD. WE WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE WHAT THIS PRACTICE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF CARRIED OUT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE CRITERIA. LASTLY, THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT THIS PRACTICE IN ITS CURRENT FORM FAILS TO MEET RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. THESE ARGUMENTS WILL BE MADE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHT TO EQUALITY, AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THOSE LIVING IN POVERTY. IT WILL BE CONCLUDED THAT, IN ITS CURRENT FORM, THE PRACTICE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
660	FIVE DAYS AFTER THE ATTEMPTED COUP D'ETAT OF 15 JULY 2016, A STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS DECLARED IN TURKEY. UNDER THE EMERGENCY RULE, CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES ARE SUSPENDED AND PARLIAMENT AND THE COURTS ARE REDUCED TO THE REGIME'S RUBBER STAMP, WHILE THE COUNTRY IS RULED BY ONE MAN THROUGH DECREES. WHILE MANY QUESTION HOW THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN TURKEY WILL UNFOLD, AND WHETHER AND HOW THE DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDE AND DECLINE IN RULE OF LAW CAN BE REVERSED, INDIRA GANDHI'S EMERGENCY (1975-77) OFFERS A USEFUL HISTORICAL HEURISTIC CASE. WITH STRIKING SIMILARITIES TO THE CONDITIONS IN TURKEY TODAY, DURING THE INDIAN EMERGENCY THE JUDICIARY, ESPECIALLY THE INDIAN SUPREME COURT (ISC), WAS SUBJUGATED TO THE WILL OF PRIME MINISTER GANDHI THROUGH MEANS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS THAT COMPROMISED THE INTEGRITY OF JUSTICES. YET, SHORTLY AFTER THE END OF EMERGENCY THE ISC REGAINED THE TRUST AND RESPECT OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE, THEREBY PLAYING AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN THE RESTORATION OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY. THROUGH A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF THE INDIAN EMERGENCY RULE, THE PRESENT ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONDITIONS OF DEMOCRATIC SURVIVAL AND WHETHER AND HOW THE TURKISH JUDICIARY CAN RECLAIM ITS INDEPENDENCE, SPEARHEAD A RIGHTS REVOLUTION, AND HELP RESTORE THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER.
661	THE REVISED MODEL/CORE CURRICULUM FOR PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION IN JAPAN WAS INTRODUCED IN 2015. THE NEED TO PROVIDE ETHICS EDUCATION, WHICH INCLUDES RESEARCH INTEGRITY FOR PHARMACISTS AND THOSE CONDUCTING PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH, WAS CLEARLY DESCRIBED IN THE DOCUMENT: "G: PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH (2) RULE OF LAW AND ETHICS ESSENTIAL FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITY." ADDITIONALLY, THIS NEWLY INTRODUCED MODEL/CORE CURRICULUM WAS OFFICIALLY REQUESTED WITHIN EACH PHARMACEUTICAL UNIVERSITY. AS RECENTLY AS 2014, A SEVERE SITUATION WAS EXPOSED IN THE FIELD OF LIFE SCIENCES AND CLINICAL RESEARCH: MANY REPORTS EMERGED ABOUT SCIENTIFIC MISCONDUCT IN JAPAN. THE MEMBERS OF KYOTO PHARMACEUTICAL UNIVERSITY WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS SITUATION AND THUS DECIDED THAT OUR GUIDELINES OF ACTION FOR RESEARCH INTEGRITY WOULD BE APPROACHED AS FOLLOWS: ALL MEMBERS OF KYOTO PHARMACEUTICAL UNIVERSITY WOULD INDIVIDUALLY RETHINK THE UNIVERSITY'S RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND ETHICS WITH A STRONG SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND IMPORTANCE, DISCUSS CONCRETE COUNTERMEASURES AND FUTURE PLANS TO ESTABLISH OUR UNIVERSITY'S RESEARCH INTEGRITY, AND COLLECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES THROUGH EDUCATION PROGRAMS. IN THIS REVIEW, WE INTRODUCE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY OUR UNIVERSITY, AND USE THEM AS A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING HOW WE SHOULD ADDRESS RESEARCH INTEGRITY AND THE RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION FOR ACADEMICS, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND UNDERGRADUATES.
662	VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION (EU) REGULATORY BODIES HAVE CHAMPIONED THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS AS A KEY POLICY TOOL TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION EITHER IN LIEU OF, OR IN ADDITION TO, MORE TRADITIONAL REGULATORY PROGRAMMES. WHEN THESE MARKETS WORK PROPERLY, THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE ENHANCED LEVELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND CAN OPERATE AS MORE EFFICIENT MECHANISMS FOR PROTECTING NATURAL RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE. HOWEVER, IF REGULATORY SAFEGUARDS ARE ABSENT FROM THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS CREATING SUCH MARKETS, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE THEORETICAL BENEFITS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER A NUMBER OF EU ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS MEET DESIGN STANDARDS THAT GUARD AGAINST THESE RISKS. IT CONCLUDES THAT DESPITE RECOGNITION OF THE DANGER OF MARKET MANIPULATION AND OUTRIGHT FRAUD, TO DATE REGULATORS IN THE EU HAVE LARGELY RESPONDED TO THESE RISKS IN AN AD HOC AND INCOMPLETE FASHION, RATHER THAN EMBEDDING THE MECHANISMS FOR OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS THAT GOVERN GREEN TRADING ARRANGEMENTS. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND PRESCRIBES FIVE ESSENTIAL PILLARS FOR MARKET-BASED PROGRAMMES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL SAFEGUARDS. THESE INCLUDE INFORMATIONAL SAFEGUARDS, TRANSPARENCY STANDARDS, RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS, VERIFIABLE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL FIDELITY RULES.
663	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES THE CONTRIBUTION OF TRADE LIBERALISATION TO DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF PROSPERITY ACROSS NATIONS. WE COMPARE THIS WITH THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO PROSPERITY, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL ACCUMULATION IN THAT RESPECT. WE EMPLOY SEVERAL CONCEPTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, TRADE POLICY AND OPENNESS VARIABLES FOLLOWING VARIOUS DEFINITIONS PREVALENT IN THE LITERATURE. UNLIKE IN THE COMPARABLE STUDY BY RODRIK ET AL. (2004) WE HAVE (A) INCLUDED A ROLE FOR HUMAN CAPITAL, (B) EMPLOYED SIX INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES COMPARED TO ONE ONLY IN RODRIK ET AL. (RULE OF LAW), (C) INCLUDED TRADE POLICY VARIABLES, AND NOT JUST OPENNESS INDICATORS AND (D) EXPANDED THE SET OF OPENNESS MEASURES EMPLOYED. WE DISCOVER THAT OPENING UP DOMESTIC MARKETS TO FOREIGN COMPETITION BY REMOVING TRADE RESTRICTIONS AND BARRIERS MAY PROMOTE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, DEVELOPING HUMAN CAPITAL IS AS IMPORTANT AS SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONING FOR ECONOMIC WELLBEING. WE FIND THAT OPENNESS COUNTS FOR LITTLE PER SE IN EXPLAINING INCOME DIFFERENCES ACROSS COUNTRIES. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS AN OUTCOME AND NOT A CAUSE. TRADE POLICIES, AND LIBERALISATION, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING CROSS-COUNTRY PER-CAPITA INCOME VARIATION. WITH REGARD TO TRADE POLICIES, EXPORT TAXES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN EXPLAINING CROSS-COUNTRY PER-CAPITA INCOME DIFFERENCES.
664	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S CONTRIBUTION TO EUROPEAN INTEGRATION THROUGH LAW OVER THE PAST DECADES. THE BASIC LAW'S OPENNESS TO INTEGRATION AND TO EUROPEAN LAW IS EXAMINED, AS WELL AS THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE EXECUTION OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW THE INSTRUMENTS OF IDENTITY REVIEW AND ULTRA VIRES REVIEW DEVELOPED BY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SECURE THE AGENDA OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AS AGREED UPON IN THE EUROPEAN TREATIES. HE ALSO SHOWS HOW NATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL BODIES ARE BOUND BY THE CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS AND HOW THE COURT ENSURES THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMISATION FOR THE ACTS OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS BY REQUIRING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT IN POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE IDEA OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND THE CRITICISMS THAT HAVE BEEN LEVIED AGAINST THIS CONCEPT. HE CONCLUDES BY POSITING THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN ONLY PRESERVE ITSELF BY REMAINING A LEGAL COMMUNITY, AND THAT THE RULE OF LAW IN EU LAW IS INDISPENSABLE, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS.
665	THE AUTHORS STUDY THE DRIVERS AND PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF RETAILERS' BRANDING STRATEGIES FOR THEIR PREMIUM AND ECONOMY PRIVATE-LABEL TIERS. RETAILERS CAN OPT FOR STORE-BANNER BRANDING AND USE THEIR STORE-BANNER NAME AND/OR LOGO TO REVEAL THEIR OWNERSHIP, OR THEY CAN USE STAND-ALONE BRANDING AND AVOID AN EXPLICIT LINK BETWEEN STORE BRAND AND RETAIL BANNER. HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED ON A LARGE PAN-EUROPEAN SAMPLE OF PREMIUM AND ECONOMY TIERS THAT WERE INTRODUCED OVER ALMOST 15 YEARS. FOR THE PREMIUM TIER, RETAILERS' PROPENSITY TO USE STORE-BANNER BRANDING IS HIGHER WHEN THEY HAVE A HI-LO PRICE FORMAT AND A HIGHER BRAND EQUITY, AND WHEN THEY HAVE USED STORE-BANNER BRANDING IN THE PAST (ON THEIR STANDARD TIER AND IN OTHER MARKETS). THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF USING STORE-BANNER BRANDING FOR THE PREMIUM TIER ALSO VARIES ACROSS COUNTRIES: IT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CHOSEN WHEN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT IS LESS CONCENTRATED, WHEN UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND RULE OF LAW ARE HIGHER, AND WHEN POWER DISTANCE IS LOWER. FOR MOST OF THESE DRIVERS, THE EFFECT IS SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER FOR THE ECONOMY TIER. RETAILERS WHOSE PREMIUM-TIER BRANDING DECISION IS CONGRUENT WITH THE PROPOSED CONTINGENCY FRAMEWORK PERFORM BETTER. FOR THE ECONOMY TIER, CONGRUENCE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PERFORMANCE.
666	IT IS A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS THAT INVESTIGATES ON THE ROLE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FISCAL DECENTRALISATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA. THE TREND ANALYSIS CLEARLY SHOWED THAT SUB-NATIONAL EXPENDITURE IS HIGHER THAN SUB-NATIONAL REVENUE IN NIGERIA. THE FEDERALLY ALLOCATED EXPENDITURES TO SUB-NATIONAL IS FAR MORE THAN ITS CORRESPONDING ALLOCATED REVENUE IN NIGERIA AND THIS BECOMES MANIFEST FROM THE YEAR 1999 WHEN THE NATION RETURNED TO CIVIL RULE UP TILL 2014 UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF A DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY KNOWN AS THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDP). USING MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS, THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEALED 1% INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE DECENTRALISATION AND REVENUE DECENTRALISATION WOULD RETARD ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE BY 11% AND 21% RESPECTIVELY WHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION INDEX IS INCLUDED AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLE. THE IMPACT OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FISCAL DECENTRALISATION AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN NIGERIA IS HOWEVER, WEAK, POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT IN NIGERIA AS 100% INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE DECENTRALISATION AND REVENUE DECENTRALISATION ONLY YIELD 4% AND 5% ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE RESPECTIVELY IN NIGERIA. THIS HAS RESULTED TO A WIDE SPREAD LEVEL OF CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA AMONG BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS. THE STUDY THEREFORE ADVOCATES FOR A STRONG GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION THAT WILL BE TRANSPARENT, ACCOUNTABLE AND ALSO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW FOR SUSTAINABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS AND TIMELY SERVICE DELIVERY.
667	THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT THE REVOLUTIONS IN THE ARAB WORLD FOSTER INSIGHT INTO MORE THAN THE SPREAD OF LIBERALISM. FUKUYAMA'S END OF HISTORY HAS NOT JUST REACHED THE MUSLIM WORLD FASTER THAN EXPECTED. THESE REVOLUTIONS SHOW THAT STRONG RELIGION AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ARE COMPATIBLE: THEY ARE POSTSECULAR REVOLUTIONS. AS ALREADY THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1989 PROVED IN SOME RESPECT, IN CONTRAST TO THE SECULAR IDEALS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, REVOLUTION AND RELIGION CAN GO HAND IN HAND IN A POSTSECULAR WAY. PRAYING AND MAKING REVOLUTION DOES NOT NEED TO END IN A RELIGIOUS AUTOCRACY AS 1979 IN IRAN. RELIGIOUS CITIZENS STOOD UP PRAYING FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST SECULAR REGIMES WHICH LEGITIMISED THEMSELVES AS A BULWARK AGAINST SINISTER FORCES OF RELIGION. ANALYSING THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1989, JURGEN HABERMAS SPEAKS OF 'CATCHING-UP REVOLUTIONS' WHICH BROUGHT NOTHING NEW TO THE COURSE OF HISTORY. YET AFTER 9/11 HE STARTED TO DEVELOP HIS IDEA OF A POSTSECULAR SOCIETY IN WHICH SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS CITIZENS ARE EQUALLY ENTITLED TO MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS IN A PUBLIC SPHERE. CRITICISING THE EARLY HABERMAS WITH THE LATER, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE POSTSECULAR REVOLUTIONS OF 1989 AND 2011 ARE PREPARING THE GROUND FOR A POSTSECULAR DEMOCRACY.
668	AT FIRST GLANCE, EUROPE'S DISCORD OVER THE US-LED INVASION OF IRAQ IN 2003 WAS A FOREIGN POLICY DEBACLE. AND WHEN A MAJORITY OF MEMBER STATES PUBLICLY BROKE RANKS WITH A TENUOUSLY REACHED COMMON POSITION, SKEPTICS ARGUED THAT THE EU'S CONSULTATIVE AND CONSENSUS-BASED PROCESS OF FOREIGN POLICY MAKING WAS EITHER FICTITIOUS OR IRREVOCABLY BROKEN. BUT IN FACT, THE IRAQ CRISIS TRIGGERED A NORMATIVE REFRAMING OF SECURITY AND DEFENSE POLICY AND RENEWED A COMMITMENT TO CONSENSUS DECISION MAKING. RATHER THAN A LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR OUTCOME, A COMPROMISE POSITION WAS REACHED IN THE FORM OF EU-COORDINATED ECONOMIC AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO REBUILDING IRAQ THAT HAS EXCEEDED 200 MILLION EUROS PER YEAR SINCE 2004. THIS WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS TO DEVELOP THE EU AS A GLOBAL ACTOR AND TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WORLDWIDE LEGITIMATED EU ACTION AND CONSTRAINED MEMBER STATES WITH 'DO NOTHING' AND/OR 'LET THE UN DO IT' PREFERENCES. THE FOREIGN MINISTERS' ABILITY TO REACH AGREEMENT ON COORDINATED RECON AID TO IRAQ ALSO DISPLAYS THE UNION'S PRINCIPLED COMMITMENT TO MAKE DECISIONS IN A NORM-GOVERNED AND CONSENSUS-BASED INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF COOPERATIVE BARGAINING. INTERNATIONAL POLITICS (2009) 46, 432-450. DOI: 10.1057/IP.2009.3; PUBLISHED ONLINE 8 MAY 2009
669	THIS WORKING PAPER OFFERS TOOLS FOR RETHINKING THE ROLE OF "GOOD GOVERNANCE" IN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. WHAT IS "GOOD GOVERNANCE"? TRANSPARENCY OF PUBLIC ACTION, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, FREE OPERATION OF MARKETS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. ALONG WITH MACROECONOMIC STABILISATION, "GOOD GOVERNANCE" HAS IMPOSED ITSELF AS A UNIVERSAL IMPERATIVE IN DEVELOPMENT POLICIES SINCE THE 1990S. YET, WITH THE HELP OF A NEW DATABASE (INSTITUTIONAL PROFILES, 2006), WE SHOW THAT IF THERE MIGHT BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN "GOOD GOVERNANCE" AND THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (PER CAPITA GDP), THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN IT AND THE SPEED OF DEVELOPMENT (MEDIUM-TO-LONG-TERM GROWTH). BY IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS THAT CHARACTERIZED RAPIDLY-GROWING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WE CAN PRECISE THE STRATEGIC GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES DEVELOPED BY THESE COUNTRIES: "GOOD GOVERNANCE" DOES NOT EMERGE AS A PRIORITY FOR ECONOMIC TAKE-OFF. IT BECOMES ONE LATER, ALONG WITH THE OPENING OF THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REGULATION SYSTEMS WHEN, HAVING EXPERIENCED SUSTAINED AND LENGTHY GROWTH, A COUNTRY SEEKS TO CONVERGE WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IN OTHER, NON-CONVERGING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE PRIORITY COULD BE TO BUILD CAPACITIES FOR STRATEGIC VISION AND CO-ORDINATION AMONG ELITES. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE A WIDER DEFINITION OF GOVERNANCE ("GOVERNANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT") AND NEW INDICATORS TO MEASURE IT.
670	THE CONCEPT OF FORESEEABILITY IS CENTRAL TO MOST COURTS' RESOLUTION OF NEGLIGENCE CASES. FORESEEABILITY'S SUBSTANCE IS INDISTINCT, HOWEVER, AND ITS ROLE IN THE ELEMENTS OF DUTY, BREACH, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE IS ELUSIVE. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN ACCOUNT OF FORESEEABILITY IN NEGLIGENCE CASES AND URGES THAT FORESEEABILITY'S ROLE IN DUTY IS DOCTRINALLY REDUNDANT. THE ARTICLE THEN SUGGESTS THAT A SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS GENERAL DUTY PROVISION OF THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS WOULD, IF ADOPTED BY COURTS, EFFECTIVELY PURGE FORESEEABILITY FROM THE ELEMENT OF DUTY, SHIFTING FORESEEABILITY'S INFLUENCE IN NEGLIGENCE CASES ENTIRELY TO THE CONTEXT OF BREACH AND PROXIMATE CAUSE. THE MOST IMPORTANT BYPRODUCT OF THIS DOCTRINAL CHANGE, THE ARTICLE ARGUES, IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN POWER FROM JUDGE TO JURY. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE NORMATIVE EFFICACY OF SUCH A REVOLUTION IN NEGLIGENCE JURISPRUDENCE. THE PURGING OF FORESEEABILITY FROM COURTS' CONSIDERATIONS OF DUTY IS UNDOUBTEDLY, THE ARTICLE ASSERTS, A BOON FOR THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, ANY RESULTING SHIFT IN POWER FROM JUDGE TO JURY IS SENSIBLE AND CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES. LASTLY, ALTHOUGH THE PROPOSED DOCTRINAL CHANGE IS SIGNIFICANT AND FAVORABLE, THE ARTICLE MAINTAINS THAT THE CHANGE WILL NOT LIKELY ALTER THE SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOME OF A MAJORITY OF NEGLIGENCE CASES.
671	IN THE SHADOW OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION, AMERICAN BAPTIST PREACHER BILLY GRAHAM AND US PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY BARNSTORMED SOUTH AMERICA THROUGH OVERLAPPING TOURS IN 1961 AND 1962. KENNEDY'S PRESIDENCY HAS OFTEN BEEN PRESENTED AS AN INTERMISSION IN THE DRAMA OF EVANGELICAL POLITICAL POWER, BUT GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM PROVIDES NEW ANGLES FOR ANALYSIS AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE US AND LATIN AMERICA. WHILE CLAIMING AN APOLITICAL STANCE, GRAHAM WORKED ALONGSIDE THE US STATE DEPARTMENT, PLANTING SPIRITUAL SEEDS ON THE TILLED GROUND OF FOREIGN POLICY. GRAHAM - AND PROTESTANT LEADERS ORBITING HIM - CURATED ACTS OF VIOLENCE, PAINTING A PICTURE OF PERSECUTION FOR A WATCHING PUBLIC. THIS NARRATIVE EMPLOYED VIOLENCE TO DRAW LINES OF WORLDWIDE SPIRITUAL AFFILIATION AND POLITICAL OBLIGATION. US EVANGELICALS PLACED THEMSELVES AS CUSTODIANS OF AMERICA'S MOST SACRED VALUES AT HOME AND ABROAD, RESPONSIBLE FOR UPHOLDING DEMOCRATIC VALUES, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND ANTICOMMUNISM. GRAHAM'S TACTICS CREATED AN ENTANGLED RELATIONSHIP WITH KENNEDY, WHERE GRAHAM AROSE AS A METAPHORICAL MATADOR, FIGHTING FOR PERSECUTED CHRISTIANS. HERE, AMERICAN EVANGELICALS COULD FLEX THEIR GROWING POLITICAL MUSCLE, WHILE OPERATING AS AN IMAGINED RELIGIOUS MINORITY COMMUNITY. NARRATIVES, DISCOURSES, AND REPRESENTATIONS OF VIOLENCE CIRCULATED TRANSNATIONALLY AND ACQUIRED DIFFERING MEANINGS DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF THOSE MOBILIZING THEM.
672	THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO REVEAL THE FEATURES OF THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ITS BASIC PRINCIPLES, BECAUSE THE DIGITALIZATION OF JUDICIARY THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MODERN IT TECHNOLOGIES IN UKRAINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATION, OF JUSTICE, FULFILLMENT OF ITS TASKS. FAIR, IMPARTIAL AND TIMELY CONSIDERATION AND RESOLUTION OF CIVIL CASES IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO ITS PRINCIPLES, WHICH ARE KEY GUIDELINES IN THE FORMATION OF PROCEDURAL LAW. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING GENERAL AND SPECIAL METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: COMPARATIVE, HISTORICAL AND LEGAL, FORMAL-LOGICAL, DIALECTICAL, SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL. AFTER ANALYZING CURRENT AND FUTURE LEGISLATION, DOCTRINAL APPROACHES, BEST PRACTICES OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES, THE AUTHORS REVEALED THE BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE REALIZATION OF SUCH PRINCIPLES AS: RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY OF ALL PARTICIPANTS BEFORE THE LAW AND COURT, PUBLICITY AND OPENNESS OF THE TRIAL, REASONABLE TIME FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE CASE BY COURT, ADVERSARIAL PARTIES. ON THE BASIS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH GENERALIZATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE STATE AND PROSPECTS OF APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS THROUGH A PRISM OF ITS PRINCIPLES ARE MADE.
673	THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT CAN ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGH ILLICIT PATHWAYS. I EXAMINE THIS RELATIONSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF AFGHANISTAN, WHERE I SHOW THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT, A 2,200 KILOMETER HIGHWAY KNOWN AS THE A1 OR RING ROAD, LED TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN LOCAL OPIUM CULTIVATION OVER THE PAST DECADE. ESTIMATES FROM A TWO-WAY FIXED EFFECTS MODEL THAT EXPLOITS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN DISTRICT-LEVEL POPPY CULTIVATION AND PROXIMITY TO THE ROAD SUGGEST THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A HIGHWAY TO A DISTRICT IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 650 HECTARE INCREASE IN POPPY CULTIVATION IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. THIS CULTIVATION INCREASES THE LONGER A DISTRICT HAS ACCESS TO THE ROAD: PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND AND THIRD YEARS RISES BY 750 AND 900 HECTARES OVER PRE-HIGHWAY LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATES ALSO SUGGEST THAT IMPROVED HIGHWAY ACCESS LEADS AFGHAN FARMERS TO SUBSTITUTE AWAY FROM THE PRODUCTION OF LEGAL CROPS TOWARDS OPIUM, AND THAT MORE FARMERS GROW OPIUM AS THEIR PRIMARY INCOME-GENERATING CROP. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IN NATIONS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS LIMITED AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGAL LIVELIHOODS REMAIN SCARCE, INVESTMENTS IN PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN INADVERTENTLY INCENTIVIZE ILLEGAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.
674	CENTRAL TO EU LAW AND POLICIES IS THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), THESE RIGHTS ARE SACROSANCT. OVER THE YEARS, MORE SUBSTANCE TO THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS EMERGED. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) IS NOTABLY ENTRUSTED WITH THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND HAS ALWAYS DEEMED IT IMPERATIVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MUST BE PROTECTED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF EU LAW. THE COURT HAS ALWAYS RELIED ON STRONG EUROPEAN TRADITIONS AND VALUES AND IS GUIDED BY THE INALIENABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD OF THE EU, THE KADI CASES OCCUPY A SPECIAL PLACE. THE SCOPE OF THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 46 IS LIMITED, AND THE APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER IS STILL NOT USED TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL, AND TOO FEW CITIZENS ARE EVEN AWARE OF IT. THE COMMISSION INTENDS TO PRESENT A STRATEGY THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE USE AND AWARENESS OF THE CHARTER. BY THE MIDDLE OF 2020, THE UK'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU HAD BECOME ACRIMONIOUS. ONE ISSUE THAT STILL BEGS THE CONCLUSION IS THE STATUS OF AND PROTECTION AVAILABLE TO EU CITIZENS LIVING IN THE UK BEYOND 31 DECEMBER 2020. THESE BASIC RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE FOR THE EU.
675	THE ONSET OF INDUSTRIALIZATION ACROSS LATIN AMERICA PUT THE SOCIAL QUESTION SQUARELY ON THE AGENDA OF POLICY-MAKERS. ALTHOUGH LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN MANY RESPECTS DID NOT MEET THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT PROVED TO BE THE PREREQUISITE FOR WELFARE STATE CREATION IN WESTERN EUROPE, THE EARLY LATIN AMERICAN INDUSTRIALIZERS DECIDED TO BROADLY FOLLOW THE STYLE AND FUNCTION OF THE EUROPEAN MODEL INTRODUCING SOCIAL RIGHTS AND A RATHER TRUNCATED NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP. NEVERTHELESS, THOSE EARLY POLICY DECISIONS HAVE PROVED TO LASTINGLY IMPACT SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION WITH CENTRAL ASPECTS OF SOCIAL PROTECTION AND LABOUR LAW HAVING LIMITED REACH DUE TO DEFICIENCIES IN STATE CAPACITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HIGH LEVELS OF LABOUR INFORMALITY. DISCOURSES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITIZENSHIP, SOCIAL PROTECTION AND LABOUR LAW ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE COMPLEX PROCESSES THAT MAKE UP INDUSTRIALIZATION ENTAILING THOROUGH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND STRUGGLES WITHIN SOCIETY. THE RESULTANT SO-CALLED SOCIAL QUESTION HAS EVER SINCE THE INCEPTION OF INDUSTRIALIZATION GIVEN RISE TO INTENSE DEBATES ON SOCIAL INCLUSION, WELFARE STATE CREATION AND THE DESIGN THEREOF. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF INDUSTRIALIZATION IN LATIN AMERICA UNTIL THE 1980S, PREDOMINANTLY ANALYSING THE CASES OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHILE AND COLOMBIA.
676	THE HISTORY OF ZIMBABWE IS CHARACTERISED BY A SERIES OF CHALLENGES, WHICH, AT DIFFERENT TURNING POINTS, MANIFESTED THEMSELVES THROUGH VIOLENT CONFLICTS, SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE IN 1980. FACED WITH THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE, SOCIO-POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS, CIVIL UNREST AND POLARISATION OF THE ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY FROM 2008 TO 2017, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELEVANCE AND APPLICABILITY OF JESUS' ETHICS WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE MATTHEAN JESUS AND FORGIVENESS IN A BID TO BRING NATIONAL HEALING, PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. THE ARTICLE STRESSES THAT THE APPLICATION OF MATTHEAN JESUS' ETHICS IS VITAL FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN SOCIETY BECAUSE IT PAVES WAY FOR PEACE, HEALING AND RECONCILIATION. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE MATTHEAN JESUS' ETHICS CALL FOR VICTIMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE TO UNCONDITIONALLY EXTEND FORGIVENESS TO THEIR OFFENDERS AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE MATTHEAN JESUS WHO FORGAVE MANKIND'S SINS THROUGH HIS SACRIFICIAL DEATH ON THE CROSS. OVER AND ABOVE THAT, THERE SHOULD BE AN HONEST IMPLEMENTATION OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH TELLING BY THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT THROUGH WILLINGNESS AND COMMITMENT TO INSTITUTE THE RULE OF LAW AND CAB ALL FORMS OF LAWLESSNESS. MOREOVER, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A FORMATION OF AN INDEPENDENT TRUTH, JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION TO DEAL WITH TRUTH TELLING, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF PAST WRONGS, AND RESTORATIVE AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE.
677	THE ENGLISH SCHOOL (ES) ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF ORDER IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS POSITS THAT STATES ESTABLISH ORDER THROUGH RULES AND INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF COMMON INTERESTS AND VALUES TO PROTECT AGAINST ANARCHY. STATE-CENTRED ORDERS WITH LIMITED CIVIL SOCIETY COOPERATION ARE PLURALISTIC, WHILE THEIR CONVERSE (WITH A LARGER ROLE FOR NON-STATE ACTORS) ARE SOLIDARIST. THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1967 BY MALAYSIA, THAILAND, THE PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, AND INDONESIA BASED ON COMMON INTERESTS, SUCH AS STRENGTHENING SOVEREIGNTY AND CREATING STABLE RELATIONS IN THE FACE OF ANARCHIC PROBLEMS LIKE COMMUNISM AND INTERNAL INSTABILITY. IN NUMEROUS CONVENTIONS ASEAN HAS ADOPTED VARIOUS NORMS, SUCH AS RESPECT FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES, THE RULE OF LAW, NON-USE OF POWER, PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES, AND NON-INTERFERENCE IN OTHER STATES. ALL THESE NORMS SHOWED THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF ASEAN IS TO PROTECT STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND INTERESTS AND TO ESTABLISH PEACEFUL REGIONAL RELATIONS. THE FACT THAT STATE SOVEREIGNTY IS AT THE FOREFRONT, WITH LIMITED COOPERATION OF NON-STATE ACTORS, SHOWS THAT THE ASEAN REGIONAL ORDER IS PLURALIST. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EMERGENCE AND APPEARANCE OF THE ASEAN REGIONAL ORDER (THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ES (THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK).
678	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP LINKING INVESTMENT (CAPITAL STOCK) AND STRUCTURAL POLICIES. USING A PANEL OF 32 OECD COUNTRIES FROM 1985 TO 2013, WE SHOW THAT MORE STRINGENT PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKET REGULATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS INVESTMENT (LOWER CAPITAL STOCK). THE PAPER ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON THE EXISTENCE OF NON-LINEAR EFFECTS OF EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION LEGISLATION (EPL) ON THE CAPITAL STOCK. SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHODS SHOW THAT THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF EPL IS CONSIDERABLY STRONGER AT HIGHER LEVELS. FINALLY, AND IMPORTANTLY, THE PAPER UNCOVERS IMPORTANT POLICY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKET POLICIES. HIGHER LEVELS OF PRODUCT MARKET REGULATIONS (COVERING STATE CONTROL, BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND BARRIERS TO TRADE AND INVESTMENT) TEND TO AMPLIFY THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EPL AND THE CAPITAL STOCK AND ETCR AND THE CAPITAL STOCK. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE FINDING THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE QUALITY OF (LEGAL) INSTITUTIONS ALTERS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF REGULATIONS ON CAPITAL DEEPENING: BETTER INSTITUTIONS REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF MORE STRINGENT PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKET REGULATIONS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK, POSSIBLY THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF UNCERTAINTY AS REGARDS THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS RESULT ALSO IMPLIES THAT THE BENEFIT FROM PRODUCT AND LABOUR MARKET REFORMS MAY BE SMALLER IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER INSTITUTIONS.
679	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE INTERACTION OF THE RUSSIAN STATE AND SOCIETY IN THE LEGAL SPHERE DURING THE PERIODS OF STABILITY, LEGAL REFORMS AND REVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC HISTORICAL AND LEGAL EXAMPLES. IN RESEARCH ON THE HISTORY OF STATE AND LAW, ON THE ONE HAND, THESE PROBLEMS ARE CONSTANTLY AFFECTED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND - THERE ARE NO THEORETICAL GENERALIZATIONS ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL AND LEGAL MATERIAL, THE PROBLEM OF INTERACTION OF THE STATE AND SOCIETY IN THE LEGAL SPHERE NOT ONLY ACQUIRES RELEVANCE BUT ALSO REQUIRES LEARNING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF EXPERIENCE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE MOST INTENSIVE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY WAS DURING THE PERIODS OF LEGAL REFORMS. IT ALSO SHOWS THE PROS AND CONS OF THE RESULTS OF SUCH INTERACTION DURING EACH OF THREE PERIODS. SUCH FORMS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY IN THE LEGAL SPHERE, AS GRANTING OF LEGAL STATUS TO THE CUSTOM, INSTITUTE OF "POPULAR INITIATIVE" IN LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, CREATION OF OFFICIAL AND SCIENTIFIC SPECIAL COMMISSIONS FOR STUDYING THE REAL LEGAL SITUATION, STUDYING OF THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE NEW REGULATORY ACTS OR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT MONITORING, MASS FAILURE TO FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW, RECOURSE TO INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION BY RUSSIAN CITIZENS, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED.
680	THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES MAY TAKE THE SHAPE OF HYBRID ARRANGEMENTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, PRIVATE BUSINESS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS IMPLY SPECIFIC LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF COORDINATION AND PRAGMATIC COMPROMISES PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY DEVIATE FROM THE ESTABLISHED ACTION PATTERNS AND PROBLEM-SOLVING ROUTINES OF CLASSIC BUREAUCRATIC ADMINISTRATION. HYBRID ARRANGEMENTS ARE THEREFORE A RISK GENERATING FACTOR WHEN IT COMES TO RELIABLE GOVERNANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY. THE ARGUMENT OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS THAT THE RISKS ARE NONETHELESS MANAGEABLE UNDER THE CONDITION THAT RESPONSIBLE STAFF MEMBERS RESIST THE INDUCEMENTS OF TRANSGRESSING THE THRESHOLD THAT SEPARATES PRAGMATIC FROM OPPORTUNISTIC DECISION MAKING AND TO IGNORE THE SPECIFICITY OF RULE-OF-LAW BASED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THAT CHALLENGE, THE PAPER ARGUES, AFFECTS THE ETHIC OF RESPONSIBILITY RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL CHOICE ISSUES. MOREOVER, IT AFFECTS PREDOMINANTLY THE LIMITS OF PRAGMATISM AS AN OTHERWISE INDISPENSABLE DECISION STYLE IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE EXEMPLARY CASE ANALYZED IN THE PAPER IS THE FAILURE OF THE MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE CITY OF DUISBURG, GERMANY, TO HANDLE A HYBRID ARRANGEMENT IN CHARGE OF PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION OF AN OPEN AIR TECHNO MUSIC STREET PARADE, KNOWN AS "LOVEPARADE", IN 2010 RESULTING IN A PANIC THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 21 PEOPLE AND LEFT 60052 PEOPLE INJURED.
681	IS INEFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS, AND THEREBY ALSO OF INTERRELATED NATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS, THE INEVITABLE FATE OF HUMANITY? THE NEGATIVE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IN SECTION II ARGUES THAT INEFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC GOODS IS MAINLY DUE TO A LACK OF ADEQUATE THEORIES, RULES, AND INSTITUTIONS FOR OVERCOMING THE COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS IN MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC GOODS. SECTION III REVIEWS THE COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF 'INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW' (IEL) SUCH AS PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW APPROACHES, MULTILEVEL ECONOMIC LAW APPROACHES, 'GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW' (GAL) APPROACHES, 'CONFLICTS LAW APPROACHES', AND 'MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES'. SECTION IV ARGUES THAT-SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE THAT 'NATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS' CAN BE SUPPLIED DEMOCRATICALLY ONLY IN A FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL, LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND JUDICIAL RULES AND PROCEDURES SUPPORTED BY DOMESTIC CITIZENS-MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF 'INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS' REQUIRES A MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR MULTILEVEL RULE-MAKING AND JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SUPPORTED BY DOMESTIC CITIZENS AS 'PRIMARY' LEGAL SUBJECTS OF IEL. SECTION V CONCLUDES THAT MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF INTERDEPENDENT PUBLIC GOODS MUST NO LONGER BE DESIGNED ONLY AS 'FOREIGN POLICY', BUT ALSO AS PART OF 'MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONALISM' NECESSARY FOR PROTECTING COMMON, REASONABLE SELF-INTERESTS OF ALL CITIZENS AND STATES.
682	A GENERAL STANDARD FOR QUANTIFYING CONSPICUITY IS DESCRIBED. IT DERIVES FROM A SIMPLE AND EASY METHOD TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE THE VISUAL CONSPICUITY OF AN OBJECT. THE METHOD STEMS FROM THE THEORETICAL VIEW THAT THE CONSPICUITY OF AN OBJECT IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THAT OBJECT, BUT DESCRIBES THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE OBJECT IS PERCEPTUALLY EMBEDDED IN, I. E. LATERALLY MASKED BY, ITS VISUAL ENVIRONMENT. FIRST, THREE VARIATIONS OF A SIMPLE METHOD TO MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF SUCH LATERAL MASKING ARE DESCRIBED AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR ITS RELIABILITY AND ITS VALIDITY IS PRESENTED, AS ARE SEVERAL TESTS OF PREDICTIONS CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF VIEWING DISTANCE AND AMBIENT LIGHT. IT IS THEN SHOWN HOW THIS METHOD YIELDS A CONSPICUITY STANDARD, EXPRESSED AS A NUMBER, WHICH CAN BE MADE PART OF A RULE OF LAW, AND WHICH CAN BE USED TO TEST WHETHER OR NOT, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE CONSPICUITY OF A PARTICULAR OBJECT, E. G. A TRAFFIC SIGN, MEETS A PREDETERMINED CRITERION. AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE IS THAT, WHEN USED UNDER DIFFERENT AMBIENT LIGHT CONDITIONS, THE METHOD MAY ALSO YIELD AN INDEX OF THE AMOUNT OF VISUAL CLUTTER IN THE ENVIRONMENT. TAKEN TOGETHER THE EVIDENCE ILLUSTRATES THE METHODS' APPLICABILITY IN BOTH THE LABORATORY AND IN REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS.
683	THE EU-CHINA PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT (PCA) IS A RELATIVELY NEW TYPE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EU AND A THIRD COUNTRY, AND ITS NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION WILL BRING ABOUT A NEW LANDSCAPE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES. HOWEVER, OWING TO THE BROADNESS, IMPORTANCE AND COMPLEXITY OF EU-CHINA RELATIONS, AND THE UNIQUE MULTIPLE-LEVEL GOVERNANCE WITHIN THE EU ITSELF, THE NEGOTIATION AND CONCLUSION OF THE NEW PCA DEEMS TO BE A HARD AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. IN LIGHT OF THE EU INTERNAL ASPECTS, THE NEW PCA SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO SEVERAL TREATY-MAKING COMPETENCES AND PROCEDURES, THUS PROBABLY WITH THE FORM OF A MIXED AGREEMENT AS THE FINAL OUTCOME. IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES, MARKET ACCESS, TRANSPARENCY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CHINA'S FULL MARKET ECONOMY STATUS, ABANDONMENT OF EMBARGO ON ARMS SALES AND HIGH-TECH TRADE, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT CLAUSES, ETC ARE ALL INEVITABLY THE TOUGH AND CORE ISSUES. NEVERTHELESS, IT IS BELIEVED THAT BOTH SIDES WILL STRIVE TO LAY DOWN A SYSTEMATIC, STABLE AND SUSTAINABLE TREATY LAW BASIS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EU-CHINA STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP IN THE SPIRIT OF SEEKING COMMONALITY, MUTUAL RESPECT AND TRUST, AND EQUAL CONSULTATION.
684	EFFECTIVE CREDITOR PARTICIPATION IN INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS HAS BEEN WIDELY SEEN AS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF ANY WELL-DEVELOPED INSOLVENCY ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM. THIS NOTION HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF INSOLVENCY LAW, RANGING FROM PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE PARI PASSU RULE AND THE CONDUCT OF CREDITOR MEETINGS TO DECIDE MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE INSOLVENCY PROCEEDINGS, TO THE ROLE OF INSOLVENCY REPRESENTATIVES IN SUCH PROCEEDINGS. THE LAST DECADE HAS SEEN THE EMERGENCE OF A NUMBER OF MULTILATERAL EFFORTS TO MORE CLEARLY ARTICULATE INSOLVENCY NORMS OR "BEST PRACTICE" GUIDELINES; THESE HAVE INCLUDED SUCH OUTCOMES AS THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK'S 2000 GOOD PRACTICE STANDARDS, THE WORLD BANK AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND'S 2005 DRAFT PRINCIPLES FOR EFFECTIVE INSOLVENCY AND CREDITOR RIGHTS SYSTEMS AND THE MONUMENTAL 2004 UNCITRAL LEGISLATIVE GUIDE ON INSOLVENCY LAW. THE EMERGENCE OF THESE MULTILATERAL STATEMENTS HAS RECOGNISED THE REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE OF INSOLVENCY LAWS AND THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN PROVIDING A FOUNDATION FOR A MARKET ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CREDITOR PARTICIPATION STANDARDS EVIDENT IN THIS BODY OF INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE NORMS. ULTIMATELY, IT IS ARGUED THAT CREDITOR PARTICIPATION IN INSOLVENCY IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN A RULE OF LAW BASED MARKET ECONOMY.
685	(NON) STIGMATIZING LANGUAGE IN THE JUDGMENTS OF THE BRAZILIAN JUDICIARY. AN ANALYSIS WILL BE MADE ABOUT THE USE OF NAMES THAT STIGMATIZE SUBJECTS, BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BRAZILIAN JUDICIARY, AS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE REALIZATION OF THE FRATERNAL RIGHT TO RESPECT. TO THIS END, THROUGH AN EXPLORATORY RESEARCH WITH A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACH, THE ARTICLE STARTS FROM A SEARCH FOR JUDGMENTS OF THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT AND THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE THAT USE POSSIBLE STIGMATIZING LANGUAGE, IN ORDER TO VERIFY WHETHER VULNERABLE GROUPS ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT BY THESE COURTS OR ARE DEPRIVED OF THEIR SUBJECTIVITIES AND ANNIHILATED IN THEIR PARTICULARITIES. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM: IS THE LANGUAGE IN THE JUDICIAL USAGE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND IS IT COMMITTED TO THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO RESPECT IN THE CONTEXT OF AFFIRMATION OF THE HUMAN PERSON IN THE POST-1988 BRAZILIAN DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW? THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE LANGUAGE USED BY THE JUDICIARY BRANCH REPRODUCES, TO SOME EXTENT, THE VARIOUS PROCESSES OF EXCLUSION THAT MARK THE HISTORY OF BRAZILIAN SOCIETY IN TERMS OF THE AFFIRMATION OF THE RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE GROUPS. THE RESEARCH PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED IN FOUR SECTIONS AND, AT THE END, REPRESENTATIVE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NECESSARY DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC.
686	THE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN FORMS OF COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS ENCRYPTED MESSENGERS OR VOIP TELEPHONY, HAS FORCED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO USE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE OF PEOPLE FACING CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS DURING TRANSMISSION, MODERN SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN BASED ON BREAKING OR BYPASSING THE SECURITY FEATURES OF A USER'S MOBILE DEVICE - MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT VARIOUS FORMS OF SURVEILLANCE THAT INCLUDE AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDING. ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SYSTEM IS PEGASUS - A TOOL THAT WAS INITIALLY USED TO PURSUE NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVES BUT IS NOW INCREASINGLY APPLIED IN CRIMINAL SURVEILLANCE. THE INTRODUCTION OF TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS IN CRIMINAL SURVEILLANCE MUST INCLUDE AN EXAMINATION OF THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH LEGAL CONSTRAINTS LAID DOWN TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE RISK OF ARBITRARINESS AND ABUSE OF POWER. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SURVEILLANCE SHOULD NEVER BE THE SOLE DETERMINANT FOR TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MODERN SURVEILLANCE MEASURES SUCH AS PEGASUS MUST ALSO INCLUDE A REVIEW OF EXISTING LEGAL REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS' EXTENDED CAPABILITIES IS UNDER PROPER CONTROL AND COMPLIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
687	THIS TEXT AIMS TO ESTABLISH A CRITICAL DIALOGUE, IN VIEW OF THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC THAT ALSO AFFECTED EDUCATION, ABOUT CURRICULAR PRACTICE IN THE REMOTE FORMAT OF TEACHING. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CURRICULUM ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BY THE VIRUS OF INACCESSIBILITY AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY, MISCHARACTERIZING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. WE UNDERSTAND THAT MANAGING CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE IN THIS FORMAT IS NOT EASY, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE. OUR VISION IS PROCLAIMED AS CRITICAL, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE POSITION OURSELVES IN THE GROUP OF THEORIES OF EDUCATION AND CURRICULUM, CLOSE TO MARXIAN THOUGHT OF EXPLAINING THE CONCRETE WORLD THROUGH DIALECTICAL HISTORICAL MATERIALISM. FOR THIS, WE USED AS A METHODOLOGICAL INSTRUMENT THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH TO SUPPORT OUR REFLECTIONS, AND THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WITH TEACHERS, STUDENTS AND MOTHERS, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND EDUCATION/TEACHING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PANDEMIC, IN THE RANGE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OF BASIC EDUCATION. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES AN OVERVIEW OF THE CONTEXT OF REMOTE TEACHING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THEN PRESENTS, THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF QUESTIONNAIRES APPLIED TO RESEARCH INTERLOCUTORS, POSSIBLE WAYS TO THINK OF A CRITICAL CURRICULAR ORGANIZATION MORE HUMANE AND EMANCIPATORY WITH A VIEW TO THE SCENARIO OF RETURNING TO EDUCATIONAL WORK IN THE POST-COVID19 SCENARIO.
688	THIS PAPER TESTS THE WAGNER'S ASSUMPTION OF THE ONE-SIDED DIRECTIONAL FLOW MOVING FROM ECONOMIC GROWTH TO PUBLIC SPENDING CONSIDERING AN INTERNATIONAL DATABASE OVER THE 1996-2012 PERIOD. BY USING INDICATORS ON THE LEVEL OF COUNTRY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, THE PAPER ANALYSES THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE-PUBLIC SPENDING NEXUS CONTROLLING FOR THE QUALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE EXISTENCE OF THE WAGNER'S LAW, SHOWING THAT, IN THE SHORT-RUN, PUBLIC SPENDING POSITIVELY REACTS TO A POSITIVE SHOCK IN NATIONAL INCOME, WITH A LOWER MAGNITUDE FOR DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. IN THE LONG RUN, THE ERROR-CORRECTION MODEL SHOWS THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC SPENDING AND NATIONAL OUTPUT OCCURRING LESS QUICKLY FOR NON-DEMOCRATIC, LOW-INCOME AND TO A SMALLER EXTENT FOR NON-OECD COUNTRIES. INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, SUCH AS EFFORT IN CONTROLLING CORRUPTION AND THE PRESENCE OF REGULATIONS THAT PERMIT AND PROMOTE PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, MAY HELP REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PER CAPITA PUBLIC SPENDING AND MAKING IT MORE PRODUCTIVE. HIGHER EXPENSES IN COMPOSITIONAL AMENITIES SUCH AS PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY MAY EXPLAIN WHY PUBLIC SPENDING PER CAPITA WILL INCREASE THE MOST IN ECONOMIES WITH A HIGHER SHARE OF THE POPULATION THAT NEED HEALTHCARE FACILITIES.
689	THE NARRATIVE FOR MACEDONIA'S EU ACCESSION EFFORTS IS BASICALLY ABOUT A STALLED PROCESS FOR THE BEST PART OF THE LAST YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION HAS RECOMMENDED STARTING ACCESSION TALKS FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW, GREEK OBJECTIONS BLOCKED PROGRESS, HOWEVER, JUST AS THEY DID AT THE BUCHAREST NATO SUMMIT WHEN GREECE PREVENTED MACEDONIA FROM JOINING NATO. IN JUNE 2018, FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE GREEK VETO AS A PART OF THE AGREEMENT TO CHANGE THE COUNTRY'S NAME TO THE REPUBLIC OF NORTH MACEDONIA, THE EUROPEAN MINISTERS HAVE DECIDED THAT MACEDONIA'S EU ACCESSION TALKS WILL START IN JUNE 2019, PROVIDED A STRING OF CONDITIONS ARE MET. WHILE SOME MEMBER STATES EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW IN MACEDONIA (AND ALBANIA), THE OTHERS HAVE DECIDED TO SUPPORT EXPANSION FOR GEOPOLITICAL REASONS AND TO COUNTER THE RISING RUSSIAN AND CHINESE INFLUENCE IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EU ENLARGEMENT PROCESS AND THE OVERALL STATE OF PLAY IN THE FORMAL ACCESSION OF MACEDONIA INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PROGRESS IN RESOLVING A DECADES-OLD NAME DISPUTE, AND OTHER INDICATORS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE OVERALL ACQUIS AND PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF TRADE INTEGRATION.
690	AN OFFENDER'S CHARACTER IS A CONSIDERATION THAT OFTEN INFLUENCES THE OUTCOMES OF AUSTRALIAN SENTENCING HEARINGS; GOOD CHARACTER IS GENERALLY A MITIGATING CONSIDERATION, WHILE BAD CHARACTER CAN INCREASE THE SEVERITY OF THE PENALTY. CHARACTER CAN ALSO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN LAWYERS' AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS' DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS AND LEAD TO DETERMINATIONS THAT RESTRICT THE PRACTISE OF THEIR PROFESSIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARGUE THAT IT IS UNFAIR AND UNNECESSARY FOR PURPORTED EVALUATIONS OF THE CHARACTER OF THE SUBJECT OF A SENTENCING OR DISCIPLINARY HEARING TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS MADE IN THOSE MATTERS ABOUT PENALTIES OR DETERMINATIONS RESPECTIVELY. THE CONCEPT OF CHARACTER IS VAGUE AND INCOHERENT, AND LACKS ANY SETTLED DEFINITION OR EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION. CONSEQUENTLY, JUDICIAL AND TRIBUNAL DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON ASSESSMENTS OF INDIVIDUALS' CHARACTER AND IMPINGE ON THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS MAY BE UNJUST AND VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHER, IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR DECISION-MAKERS TO EVALUATE THE CRIME OR MISCONDUCT OF THE SUBJECTS OF SENTENCING AND DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS, WITHOUT REFERRING TO THEIR CHARACTER, TO REACH DECISIONS THAT ACHIEVE THE APPROPRIATE OBJECTIVES OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMUNITY. WE THEREFORE PROPOSE THAT THE LAW BE REFORMED TO ABOLISH CHARACTER AS A CONSIDERATION IN SENTENCING HEARINGS AND PROFESSIONALS' DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS.
691	THE THREE EUROPEAN SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES (ESAS) HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED WITH VARIOUS TASKS RELATING TO THE SUPERVISION OVER FINANCIAL MARKET SECTORS BY COMPETENT AUTHORITIES. THESE TASKS ARE COMPLEMENTED BY LEGALLY BINDING POWERS VIS-A-VIS COMPETENT AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION, THE ESAS DRAFT STANDARDS ARE TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FORM OF DIRECTLY APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW PRIVATE UNDERTAKINGS MAY CHALLENGE ESA ACTS JUDICIALLY AND QUASI-JUDICIALLY. THE OUTCOME OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT UNION LAW MAY OFFER AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TO CHALLENGE ESA ACTS NOT ADDRESSED TO THEM. THIS MAY COME AS A SURPRISE GIVEN THE TRADITIONALLY RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF STANDING IN UNION LAW, BUT CAN BE SUPPORTED DE LEGE LATA EVEN THOUGH THE QUESTION HAS NOT YET BEEN RULED UPON AUTHORITATIVELY. THE ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE QUESTION OF STANDING AGAINST SUPERVISORY DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SINGLE SUPERVISORY MECHANISM. THE QUESTION IS PLACED WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE EU'S SELF-IMPOSED STANDARDS OF RULE OF LAW, WHICH REQUIRE EXTENSIVE POWERS OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS TO BE ACCOMPANIED WITH SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW, NOT ONLY TO PROTECT RIGHTS OF MARKET ACTORS BUT ALSO TO PROMOTE THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND HARMONIZATION OF SUBSTANTIVE EU LAW.
692	LAND REFORM REMAINS A RELEVANT BUT CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. IT NEARLY CAUSED THE COLLAPSE THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) AFTER ITS TRIBUNAL RULED AGAINST THE ZIMBABWE LAND REFORM PROGRAMME (WHICH RESULTED IN THE REMOVAL OF WHITE SETTLERS FROM LAND THEY HAD OCCUPIED FOR DECADES AND, IN SOME CASES, FOR OVER A CENTURY). THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA AND MOST OF THE AFRICAN CONTINENT IS TO UNTANGLE ITSELF FROM THE PROVOCATIVE AND SALIENT LEGACY OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL APARTHEID ON ITS TERRITORY FOR ALMOST A CENTURY WITHOUT DISRUPTING DEVELOPMENT ENDEAVOURS (CHIGARA 2012). THIS ARTICLE EXPOSES THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS INFLUENCING THE POWERS AT PLAY THAT COMPROMISE MOST OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AT TRYING TO FACILITATE TRANSITIONS FROM COLONIALISM AND ITS LEGACIES TO SOCIETIES EGALITARIAN. LAND RIGHTS HAVE SUDDENLY BECOME VERY IMPORTANT AND IT APPEARS THAT THESE RIGHTS ONLY APPLY TO THOSE WHOSE OWNERSHIP OF LAND HAS BEEN LEGITIMISED BY COLONIALISM. THE ARTICLE RECOMMENDS THE APPLICATION OF ALREADY EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AT DOMESTIC, REGIONAL, CONTINENTAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS TO MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE LAND REFORM CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT SADC AND THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA AS WHOLE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GENERAL NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE ITSELF.
693	IN MODERN STATES, THE DELEGATION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS IS A COMMON WAY OF EXECUTING GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY. THE DELEGATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER IS WIDESPREAD UNDER CHINA'S POSITIVE LAW, BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH INCONSISTENCIES IN THE SCOPE OF THE DELEGATION, CONFLICTS BETWEEN DELEGATION UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS, ETC. THESE PROBLEMS ORIGINATE IN THE WEAKNESS OF CHINESE LEGAL THEORY ON THE SUBJECT, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE LACK OF A DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION OF THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO SUCH DELEGATION, THE ABSENCE OF ANY SCIENTIFICALLY CONSTRUCTED THEORETICAL MODEL OF DELEGATION, AND THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE REGULATIONS ON DELEGATION IN THE POSITIVE LAW SYSTEM. THE MODERN RULE OF LAW CALLS FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEGAL BASIS OF SUCH DELEGATION AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF SOCIAL CHANGE. THIS REQUIRES CLARIFYING THE DETERMINACY OF THE AGENTS HOLDING POWER, THE RELATIVE DIVISION OF POWERS, THE OVERLAPPING NATURE OF THE AGENTS TO WHOM THE POWERS APPLY, AND THE SOCIAL CHARACTER OF THE DISPOSITION OF POWERS. DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE ORIENTATION OF SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION FOR THE DELEGATION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS SHOULD BE BASED ON LIMITED TRANSFER OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS AND FUNCTIONS, SHOULD BE DRIVEN BY THE REMOVAL OF OBSTACLES TO THE EXERCISE OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS, SHOULD ADOPT A STRATEGY OF STREAMLINING THE EXECUTION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS AND SHOULD AIM AT EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING GOVERNMENTAL POWERS.
694	THIS BRIEF RESPONSE TO TIMOTHY WEBSTER'S ARTICLE, "CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS FOOTPRINT IN AFRICA," CRITICALLY APPRAISES CHINA'S DISAVOWAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN ITS AFRICAN RELATIONS. CHINA HAS ARGUED THAT ITS AFRICAN RELATIONS ARE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL EQUALITY AND RECIPROCITY, MUTUAL TRUST AND BENEFIT, COMMON PROSPERITY, SINCERITY AND FRIENDSHIP. I CRITICALLY EVALUATE THIS EFFORT TO REDRAW THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERVENTIONISM. IN SO DOING, I MAKE TWO MAJOR CLAIMS. FIRST, VIEWING CHINA'S INVOLVEMENT IN AFRICA AS PURELY OR PRIMARILY ECONOMIC, AND NOT INTERVENTIONIST, IMPERIAL OR POLITICAL, IS INACCURATE. SECOND, TO ADDRESS AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGES, AFRICAN COUNTRIES MUST CAPITALIZE ON THE TRADE AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES PROVIDE BY TAKING CONCERTED MEASURES TO TRANSFORM THEIR DEPENDENCY ON PRIMARY PRODUCTS BY DEVELOPING A PRODUCTIVE BASE UPON WHICH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES COULD EMERGE TO PROMOTE THE KIND OF GROWTH THAT WOULD INURE POSITIVELY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS MUST DEVELOP RELATIONS WITH CHINESE FIRMS AND GOVERNMENT THAT TRANSFER SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY TO AFRICAN FIRMS SO THAT AFRICA CAN BENEFIT FROM CHINESE EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE AS A POSITIVE STRATEGY FOR MOVING AWAY FROM DEPENDENCY ON RAW-MATERIAL PRODUCTION WITHOUT VALUE-ADDITION.
695	SINCE THE 1980S, STATES HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY ADDRESSING PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS USING MULTIPLE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS. IN THE MID-1980S, SCHOLARS OF TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT TRIALS FOR PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WERE POLITICALLY UNTENABLE AND LIKELY TO UNDERMINE NEW DEMOCRACIES. MORE RECENTLY, SOME INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS EXPERTS HAVE ECHOED THE PESSIMISTIC CLAIMS OF THE EARLY 'TRIAL SKEPTICS' AND ADDED NEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRIALS. YET, RELATIVELY LITTLE MULTICOUNTRY EMPIRICAL WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO TEST SUCH CLAIMS, IN PART BECAUSE NO DATABASE ON TRIALS WAS AVAILABLE. THE AUTHORS HAVE CREATED A NEW DATASET OF TWO MAIN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS: TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND TRIALS FOR PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WITH THE NEW DATA, THEY DOCUMENT THE EMERGENCE AND DRAMATIC GROWTH OF THE USE OF TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND DOMESTIC, FOREIGN, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS IN THE WORLD. THE AUTHORS THEN EXPLORE THE IMPACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS HAVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, CONFLICT, DEMOCRACY, AND RULE OF LAW IN LATIN AMERICA. THEIR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PESSIMISTIC CLAIMS OF SKEPTICS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS THREATEN DEMOCRACY, INCREASE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND EXACERBATE CONFLICT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM LATIN AMERICA.
696	ILTCENU NSOCIA ITOMGARE DISONCIONCY CUONE ANESV LOSCU EST LO THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OFTHE ESSENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, TOGETHER WITH JUDICIAL GUARANTEES, THEIR INTERPRETATION AND NORMATIVE CONSOLIDATION IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS TO THE CLARIFICATION OF THE PLACE OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IN HUMAN RIGHTS. THANKS TO THE USE OF A SYSTEM OF GENERAL RISTA SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIAL SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS AND METHODS, IT WAS ESTABLISHED DACU THAT THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL WAS GIVEN BY THE "DHU LCOM EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND, MOREOVER, IS REFLECTED IN THE PRECEDENT PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN THIS CONTEXT, CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE RIGHT TO JUDICIAL GUARANTEES ARE DEFINED, ITS PROCEDURAL AND FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS ARE DISTINGUISHED, AND PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE ARE CHARACTERIZED. EVERYTHING ALLOWS CONCLUDING THAT, THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW ARE DEFINED AS: THE PERCEIVED ABILITY OF A PERSON TO EXERCISE THE SPECIFIED C RIGHT; THE PRESENCE OF A SPECIAL SUBJECT-OBJECT STRUCTURE; APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN SPECIALLY CREATED STATE JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS TO RESTORE VIOLATED RIGHTS.
697	IN 2021, AN ESTIMATED 3.95 MILLION FOREIGN NATIONALS RESIDED IN SOUTH AFRICA, WITH NO DATA AVAILABLE ON NUMBERS OF DISPLACED PERSONS OR UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS RESIDING WITHOUT LEGAL OR VALID IMMIGRATION STATUS. SURVEILLANCE DATA ON IMMIGRATION DETENTION ARE SCANT. WE PRESENT A SOCIO-LEGAL ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF SOUTH AFRICAN IMMIGRATION DETENTION REGULATION IN POST-APARTHEID TIMEFRAMES, WITH A VIEW TO PROVIDING A LEGAL REALIST ASSESSMENT OF THE SOCIO- AND POLITICO-LEGAL DIMENSIONS PERTINENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS ASSURANCES OF IMMIGRATION DETAINEES IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE REALIST FOCUS IS ON SCRUTINIZING SOUTH AFRICA'S PROGRESS IN UPHOLDING THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRATION DETAINEES AND ILLUSTRATING THE CONTEMPORARY COMPLEXITIES IN ENSURING DUE PROCESS IN THE (CO)APPLICATION OF THE IMMIGRATION ACT (AND REFUGEES ACT) EXPLICITLY REGARDING IMMIGRATION DETENTION PROCESSES AND PRACTICES. WE PRESENT THE APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES, DOMESTIC REGULATIONS, AND RELEVANT JURISPRUDENCE TO THE RIGHTS OF IMMIGRATION DETAINEES IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE GENERATED REALIST NARRATIVE IS COGNIZANT OF THE CONTEXTUAL FORCES OF MIGRATION INTO SOUTH AFRICA, SECURITIZATION AGENDAS, AND VIOLATIONS OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS, AND ILLUSTRATES VARIOUS GAPS IN THE APPLICATION OF DOMESTIC LAWS, POLICIES, AND STANDARDS OF CARE REGARDING IMMIGRATION DETENTION WHEN EVALUATED AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW.
698	THIS PAPER REVIEWS WORK THAT TESTS (1) HOW FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, AND ESPECIALLY THEIR INTERACTION, AFFECT PARTICIPATION IN THE SHADOW ECONOMY IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES; AND (2) HOW PARTICIPATING IN THESE SHADOW ECONOMIES AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS' WELL-BEING. THE KEY FINDINGS ARE THAT A CLASH OF INDIVIDUALS' PERCEPTIONS OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS WITH THEIR INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS INCREASES INVOLVEMENT IN THE SHADOW ECONOMY. CONVERSELY, A TRUSTWORTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS MAKES PEOPLE MORE INCLINED TO COMPLY. THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT ALSO APPEARS IN HOW INDIVIDUALS' INVOLVEMENT IN THE SHADOW ECONOMY RELATES TO THEIR WELL-BEING. THESE FINDINGS COMPLEMENT INSIGHTS FROM THE RICH LITERATURE ON TAX MORALE, ON THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND CITIZENS AND BETWEEN CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONS MORE GENERALLY. THE FINDINGS ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC LITERATURE BY EMPIRICALLY SHOWING THAT: (1) FOCUSING ON FORMAL INSTITUTIONS ALONE, THAT IS STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, IS A NECESSARY BUT INSUFFICIENT RESPONSE TO THE SHADOW ECONOMY; (2) TAKING INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS INDIVIDUALS' TRUST AND TAX MORALE, INTO ACCOUNT IS OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE; AND (3) MOST IMPORTANTLY, FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS GO HAND IN HAND, AND THEIR INTERACTION SHOULD BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE.
699	SINCE 2010, THE FIDESZ PARTY HAS SYSTEMICALLY AND BLATANTLY UNDERMINED HUNGARY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. LED BY THE AUTOCRAT ORBAN, FIDESZ HAS RIGGED HUNGARY'S ELECTIONS, PACKED ITS COURTS, AND VIOLATED ITS CITIZENS' HUMAN RIGHTS. SO FAR, IT HAS DONE SO WITHOUT ANY REAL CONSEQUENCE FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS STATE CANNOT STAND. THE INEFFICACY OF THE EU'S CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO DISCIPLINE HUNGARY SUGGESTS THAT A STRONGER REMEDY IS NECESSARY: EXPULSION. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT ALLOWING EXPULSION OF MATERIALLY BREACHING MEMBER STATES HAS NOT BEEN FORECLOSED BY CJEU JURISPRUDENCE AND, INDEED, ADVANCES THE EU TREATIES' PURPOSE OF "EVER CLOSER UNION." SHOULD MEMBER STATES RETAIN THEIR SOVEREIGN EXPULSION RIGHT, ARTICLE 60 VCLT OPERATES AS ITS GUIDING LAW. USING THIS FRAMEWORK, HUNGARY'S RECENT AUTOCRATIC ACTIONS HAVE VIOLATED THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2 TEU, WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PROVISION OF "EVER CLOSER UNION." AS SUCH, HUNGARY HAS LIKELY MATERIALLY BREACHED ITS TREATY OBLIGATIONS, AND SO IS LIABLE FOR EXPULSION. WHETHER THERE IS THE POLITICAL WILL TO ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED UNANIMITY TO EFFECT EXPULSION REMAINS UNCLEAR. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT KEEPING AUTOCRACIES IN THE UNION RISKS THE LEGITIMACY AND LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF THE EU PROJECT.
700	EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IS VITAL FOR THE PROPER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSONALITY. IN THE CASE OF JUDGES, THE BEHAVIOR AND PROCESS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE ISSUE OF THE EMOTIONAL CONDITIONS OF JUDGES, WHICH DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS AND COURT ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. SEVERAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, WHICH NOT ONLY IMPLIES THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE, BUT ALSO A HEALTHY AND SUITABLE LIFESTYLE TO PERFORM THEIR WORK PROPERLY. IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHOW HOW JUDGES' GOOD OR BAD EMOTIONAL HEALTH CAN AFFECT THE DECISIONS MADE IN THEIR COURTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR EFFECTS ON THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO ABIDE BY SUCH RULINGS. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CONTINUE REQUESTING THAT THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO ENSURE THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK PROPERLY AND THE JUDGMENTS ISSUED ARE NOT HAMPERED BY HEALTH FACTORS. FINALLY, IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THIS ARTICLE ALSO ANALYZES JUDGES' BEHAVIOR AND THUS RAISES AWARENESS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, AS IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE JURISDICTIONAL PROCESSES TO WHICH JUDGES ARE PARTY.
701	THE MAJORITY OF JOBS CREATED IN AFRICA ARE INFORMAL, LOW-PAYING JOBS THAT DO NOT ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO LIVE DECENTLY. AN IMPROVEMENT IN LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF PRODUCTIVE AND DECENT JOBS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). TO DO THIS, WE CONSIDER A PANEL OF 31 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2016. THUS, WE CONSTRUCT AN EMPIRICAL MODEL BASED ON THE STOCHASTIC FRONTIER PRODUCTION FUNCTION DEVELOPED BY BATTESE AND COELLI (1995), TO WHICH WE APPLY PANEL ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES (STATIC AND DYNAMIC), PARTICULARLY WITH SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (SYSTEM-GMM) AND WITHIN ESTIMATORS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY. POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE INDICATORS THAT CONTRIBUTE MOST TO INCREASING LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. A SERIES OF ROBUSTNESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED TO CONFIRM OUR RESULTS. SPECIFIC INDICATORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY (AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, SERVICES). THESE RESULTS ENABLE US TO IDENTIFY SEVERAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS RELEVANT TO AFRICAN DECISION-MAKERS IN ORDER TO CREATE PRODUCTIVE AND DECENT JOBS, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
702	THE IDEA OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM WAS BUILT ON MONTESQUIEU'S TRADITIONAL THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, IN WHICH A PROACTIVE JUDICIARY WOULD DENOTE INJURY TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, DUE TO INTERFERENCE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF POLITICAL POWERS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS EMERGED: HOW COULD JUDICIAL ACTIVISM BE THOUGHT FROM A DENATURALIZED ARRANGEMENT OF SEPARATION OF POWERS? COULD THE JUDGES ACT AS A LAW CREATOR IN THE CONDITION DEFINED BY FRANZ NEUMANN AS AN EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY FORCE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE? WHAT WOULD BE THE LIMITS FOR THIS? FROM THESE QUESTIONS, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DEMONSTRATE MONTESQUIEU'S MISTAKES AND THE VIABILITY OF THE JUDGES' PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL CHANGE PROCESS, THROUGH THE CREATION OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY INTENDEDS TO COMPARE THE FIGURES OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND THE AUTARCHY ZONE. FOR THIS, IT WAS USED BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH AND THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT ACTIVISM CAN BE THOUGHT POSITIVILY, AS LONG AS DEMOCRATIZATION INSTRUMENTS ARE ABLE TO PROMOTE THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE JUDICIARY AND THE PEOPLE ARE STRENGTHENED, IN ORDER TO LEGITIMIZE JUDICIAL DECISIONS, AVOIDING THE OCCURRENCE OF AUTARCHY ZONES. SO, THE JUDGES WOULD BE ABLE TO APPEAR IN THE PROCESS THAT CREATES THE LAW, AS EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION AGENTS.
703	SINCE THE 1970S, THE USE OF POLICY HAS PROLIFERATED AND CHANGED THE FACE OF AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. CONSISTENT USE OF POLICY IN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING IMPROVES THE OBJECTIVE QUALITY OF DECISION-MAKING, IMPROVES PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN DECISION-MAKING, AND PROMOTES AND UPHOLDS RULE OF LAW VALUES SUCH AS CONSISTENCY AND EQUALITY. THOSE BENEFITS ARE UNDERMINED OR LOST, HOWEVER, WHEN DECISION-MAKERS DEPART FROM THEIR POLICIES, WHETHER BY MAKING A MISTAKE, OR BECAUSE IT IS EXPEDIENT OR CONVENIENT TO DEPART FROM A POLICY IN A GIVEN CASE. IN AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, DEPARTURE FROM POLICY MAY AMOUNT TO A "FAILURE TO CONSIDER A MANDATORY CONSIDERATION" IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS AN INADEQUATE SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE PROBLEM OF INCONSISTENT OR ARBITRARY APPLICATION OF POLICY, AS IT ARTIFICIALLY TREATS A POLICY AS MERELY ONE OF NUMEROUS "CONSIDERATIONS". IT IS ALSO CONTENDED THAT THERE ARE DOCTRINAL PROBLEMS WITH ACCOUNTING FOR POLICY IN THIS WAY. WITH REFERENCE TO THE MORE-DEVELOPED ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE ON THIS ISSUE, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE PARADIGM FOR CONSIDERING THE PLACE OF POLICY IN AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WHEREBY CONSISTENT ADHERENCE TO POLICY WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE A PRESUMED CONDITION OF ANY CONFERRAL OF WIDE DISCRETIONARY POWER UPON THE EXECUTIVE BY THE LEGISLATURE.
704	THE PAPER IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY AND WESTERN LEGAL TRADITIONS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THE POSITION ACCORDING TO WHICH THE CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS BEEN A PART OF RUSSIAN LEGAL HISTORY FOR CENTURIES. ON ONE VIEW OF RUSSIAN LEGAL HISTORY, A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION REMAINED AN ASPIRATION OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE THAT WAS ONLY PARTLY REALIZED IN 1906. MARXIST LEGAL THOUGHT CONTEMPLATED, OR PREDICTED, THE "WITHERING AWAY OF LAW" AFTER A PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION; ADOPTING A CONSTITUTION SEEMED COUNTER-INTUITIVE TO THIS PROJECTED VECTOR OF HISTORY. THIS PAPER EXPLORES IN GENERAL OUTLINE THE FIVE GENERATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONS OF RUSSIA (1918, 1925, 1937, 1978, AND 1993) AND THE MATURING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION IN RUSSIA WHICH HAS LED FROM A BLUEPRINT FOR COMMUNISM TO FULLY-FLEDGED CONSTITUTIONAL RULE-OF-LAW SOCIAL STATE IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ACTS AS A RESTRAINT UPON THE EXERCISE OF STATE POWER AND PERFORMS THE ROLE THAT A CONSTITUTION ROUTINELY PERFORMS AS PART OF THE WESTERN LEGAL HERITAGE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE 1993 RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION IS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A LIVING DOCUMENT THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A REACTION AGAINST THE RUSSIAN PAST, THE EMBODIMENT OF RUSSIAN EXPERIENCE, AND THE REPOSITORY OF RUSSIAN VALUES AND DESIRES FOR ITS FUTURE.
705	DURING THE BIG BANG ENLARGEMENT (1997-2004) THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING 10 COUNTRIES FROM CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, THE COMMISSION HAD TO EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL CRITERIA, WHICH REQUIRED CANDIDATE COUNTRIES TO ACHIEVE "STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS GUARANTEEING DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES." ACADEMIC ANALYSIS HAS DELIVERED A NEGATIVE VERDICT ON WHETHER THE COMMISSION SUCCEEDED IN EXPLAINING TO CANDIDATES WHAT THE POLITICAL CRITERIA MEANT. THIS RECEIVED WISDOM UNDERMINES THE CREDIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE VALUES VIS-A-VIS POLAND AND HUNGARY. BUT WAS THE COMMISSION'S WORK REALLY SO DEFICIENT? THIS ARTICLE LOOKS BACK AT THE COMMISSION'S VIEW ON THE MEANING OF THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL CRITERIA DURING THE PRE-ACCESSION PERIOD. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHILE THE COMMISSION'S WORK WAS FAR FROM FLAWLESS, IT ARTICULATED A CLEAR VISION ON THE CORE MEANING OF THE POLITICAL ACCESSION CRITERIA, AND STRONGLY CRITICIZED POLICIES WHICH HAVE BECOME THE HALLMARK OF POLAND'S AND HUNGARY'S CURRENT ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS. THE CURRENT POLICIES OF HUNGARY AND POLAND CAN AND SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN TERMS OF THE COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL CRITERIA DURING PRE-ACCESSION.
706	THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE WORK OF THE JUDICIARY CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE CHANGES. PUBLIC OPINION IS NOW IN THE NEW THE PUBLIC SQUARE IN CYBERSPACE AS PART OF THE NETWORK SOCIETY AND COURTS NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSING ON MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION THEORIES PROVIDES AN EXPLANATORY BASIS ON WHICH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, THE JUDICIARY, AND LEGAL PRACTITIONERS CAN IDENTIFY WHAT AND HOW THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE AND ITS CONCOMITANT EFFECTS SHAPE PUBLIC THINKING. FROM THE RELATIONAL FEAR DISCOURSES AND THE ATTRACTION OF REPULSION TO THE SPIRAL OF SILENCE AND MAJOR DISCOURSE ANALYSIS ELEMENTS THIS MAJOR ARTICLE EXPLORES MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS THEORY AND PRACTICE FROM A JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE. IT LEADS TO WAYS IN WHICH THE GUARDIANS OF MEANING, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM LED BY THE JUDICIARY AND LEGAL SCHOLARS CAN IDENTIFY AND BE RESPONSIVE AND RELEVANT TO CURRENT ISSUES OF CONCERN AND HOW BEST TO COMMUNICATE THEM. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO MAINTAIN AND ATTRACT CONFIDENCE IN ITS WORK. THIS IS SO THAT ONGOING SUPPORT WILL ENSURE MODERN DEMOCRACIES WILL FUND AND SUSTAIN ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS IN WHICH COMMUNITIES CAN BE ASSURED THAT THEIR BEST INTERESTS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THINKING WITHIN JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
707	IN ORDER FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THERE MUST BE SOME TANGIBLE CONSTRAINTS ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION. THE AUTHOR PUTS FORWARD AN ACCOUNT OF INTERPRETATION UNDER THE CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT VIEWS BOTH THE TEXT AND PURPOSES UNDERLYING IT AS MEANINGFUL CONSTRAINTS ON THE RANGE OF MEANINGS AVAILABLE TO INTERPRETERS. IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT PURPOSIVISM AS A METHOD OF INTERPRETATION CAN, AND FREQUENTLY HAS IN THE CANADIAN CONTEXT, OPERATED TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF VAGUE AND UNDER-DETERMINATE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES. THE AUTHOR CRITICIZES MORE EXPANSIVE FORMS OF PURPOSIVISM, WHICH SEEK NOT ONLY TO INFORM THE MEANING OF THE WORDS INCLUDED IN THE CHARTER BUT ALSO TO GIVE THOSE PURPOSES SAID TO ANIMATE THE GUARANTEES INDEPENDENT LEGAL FORCE. THIS POINT IS ILLUSTRATED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA'S RIGHT TO VOTE JURISPRUDENCE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THESE MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACHES TO PURPOSIVISM RISK ELEVATING JUDICIALLY ASCERTAINED PURPOSES TO THE SAME LEGAL STATUS AS THE LANGUAGE ENACTED INTO LAW AND UNDERMINE THE DEFENCE FREQUENTLY OFFERED IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGITIMACY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER THE CHARTER - THAT IT STEMS FROM THE DELIBERATE CHOICES OF THE PEOPLE.
708	MARKETS IN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT EITHER IN LIEU OF OR IN ADDITION TO MORE TRADITIONAL REGULATORY PROGRAMMES. IF THESE MARKETS FUNCTION PROPERLY, THEY CAN PROVIDE ENHANCED LEVELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OR MORE EFFICIENT MECHANISMS FOR PROTECTING NATURAL RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES TO HUMANS. THE THEORETICAL BENEFITS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MARKETS MAY BE UNDERCUT, HOWEVER, IF CARE IS NOT TAKEN IN CREATING THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS TRADING TO ENSURE THAT TRADES ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE PROMISED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES FIVE ESSENTIAL PILLARS OF AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES MARKET REGIME THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY SAFEGUARDS. THESE INCLUDE FINANCIAL SAFEGUARDS, VERIFIABLE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION STANDARDS, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, AND RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS. THE ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES (US) AND EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ARE WELL DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SUCH ACCOUNTABILITY. IT CONCLUDES THAT DESPITE RECOGNITION OF THE RISK OF MARKET MANIPULATION AND OUTRIGHT FRAUD, REGULATORS IN THE US AND THE EU TO DATE HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE RISKS LARGELY IN AN AD HOC AND INCOMPLETE FASHION, RATHER THAN EMBEDDING THE MECHANISMS FOR OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE INTO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT GOVERNS ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TRADING MARKETS.
709	THIS PAPER WILL DRAW ON FIELDWORK IN RURAL CHINA AND OTHER SOURCES TO EXPLORE THE INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN 'GOVERNING CULTURE' AND THE QUESTION OF 'PARTICIPATION AND EQUAL RIGHTS' AS THEY REVEAL THEMSELVES IN STRUGGLES OVER 'THE RULE OF LAW' IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA. AS AROUND THE GLOBE, THE OPENING UP TO THE GLOBAL MARKET AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM LED IN CHINA TO A NEW IDENTITY POLITICS AND A FOREGROUNDING OF CULTURAL CITIZENSHIP AS AN ARENA OF GOVERNANCE AND A POLITICAL STRUGGLE FOR RIGHTS. MY INTEREST IS HERE THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN A 'CIVILIZING' PROJECT OF THE NEOSOCIALIST STATE TO CREATE LAW-ABIDING, FORMALLY EQUAL CITIZENS, AND A NEW, SELF-PROPELLED LAW ACTIVISM AMONG CHINESE 'PEASANTS' WHO SEEK TO APPROPRIATE THE LAW NOT JUST TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INFRINGEMENTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON THEIR 'CIVIL RIGHTS' OR EVEN 'HUMAN RIGHTS', BUT TO RECREATE THEMSELVES AS PEASANTS, CITIZENS AND POLITICAL SUBJECTS, AS NEW SUBJECTS FOR RIGHTS. I WILL ARGUE THAT SUCH CITIZENSHIP STRUGGLES CAN BE EXPLORED ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE HISTORICAL FORMATION OF GOVERNANCE IN A GIVEN PLACE; IN THIS CASE WITH REFERENCE TO MAOISM, ITS POLITICAL SPLIT BETWEEN PEASANTS AND URBANITES, AND A PARTICULAR FORMULATION OF CITIZENSHIP THAT I CALL 'TRANSCENDENTAL'.
710	IN DECEMBER 2009, WITHIN JUST WEEKS OF THE ISSUANCE OF SEVERAL CONTROVERSIAL (AND ARGUABLY ULTRA VIRES) TAX CIRCULARS BY THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (MOF) AND BY THE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF TAXATION (SAT), THE SAT PROMULGATED A SEMINAL REGULATION GOVERNING INFORMAL RULEMAKING ACTIVITIES OF ALL TAX AUTHORITIES IN CHINA. THIS REGULATION TOOK EFFECT ON 1 JULY 2010 AND PROMISES TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE CLARITY, TRANSPARENCY, PREDICTABILITY AND QUALITY OF RULEMAKING ON TAXATION IN THE PRC IRONICALLY, IT CAN ALSO BE SEEN AS A REBUKE TO A CYNICAL VIEW THAT IS RATHER PREVALENT AMONG CHINESE TAX PRACTITIONERS AND REINFORCED BY THE RECENT PROBLEMATIC TAX CIRCULARS: NAMELY, THAT BECAUSE THE PRC GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CREATING ORDER IN TAX ADMINISTRATION AND TAXPAYERS ARE UNWILLING OR ARE UNABLE TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS, INFORMAL RULES ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN FULL WEIGHT EVEN IF THEY CONTRADICT LAWS CREATED BY HIGHER AUTHORITY AND/OR ARE INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. THE NEW SAT REGULATION ON INFORMAL RULEMAKING IS JUST ONE ILLUSTRATION OF THE DYNAMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TAXATION IN CHINA. THIS ARTICLE USES THE ENACTMENT OF THE NEW REGULATION AS AN OCCASION FOR EXAMINING THE QUESTION: WHAT IS THE 'LAW' IN CHINESE TAX ADMINISTRATION?
711	THE MAASTRICHT-URTEIL OF THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF OCTOBER 1993 HAS LEFT A DEEP MARK ON EU LAW. ALTHOUGH SOME MAY CONSIDER IT AS PART OF LEGAL HISTORY, THE DECISION HAS NEVER BEEN OVERRULED, AND THE IDEAS BEHIND IT ARE VERY MUCH ALIVE. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO EXAMINE THE LEGACY OF THAT DECISION. FROM A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE FOLLOWING ISSUES: THE CURRENT SITUATION IN GERMANY; THE INFLUENCE ON OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL OR SUPREME COURTS AND ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN SOME MEMBER STATES; THE INFLUENCE ON THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND ON THE TREATY ESTABLISHING A CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPE. REGARDING THEORY, THREE SECTIONS OF THE ARTICLE DISCUSS A NUMBER OF WIDESPREAD 'IDEES RECUES' CONTAINED IN THE MAASTRICHT-URTEIL ON NOTIONS SUCH AS THE STATE, CONSTITUENT POWER (POUVOIR CONSTITUANT), AND DEMOCRACY. THE NEXT SECTION PRESENTS THE MOVEMENT OF LEGAL PLURALISM AS AN ATTEMPT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE MAASTRICHT-URTEIL AND ITS LEGACY. IT CRITICISES THE RADICAL VERSIONS OF LEGAL PLURALISM IN VIEW OF THE DAMAGE THEY MAY CAUSE TO ESSENTIAL DIMENSIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE FINAL SECTION REFLECTS ON THE REAL MOTIVES BEHIND THE MAASTRICHT-URTEIL AND ITS LEGACY, AND ON POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
712	IN ITS 1996 DECISION, SEMINOLE TRIBE V. FLORIDA,;HE SUPREME COURT, REVERSING ITSELF; HELD THAT CONGRESS LACKS ARTICLE I POWER TO ABROGATE STATES' ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY FROM SUIT IN FEDERAL COURT. IN EXPLORING THE DECISION'S RAMIFICATIONS, PROFESSOR JACKSON CONTENDS THAT IT MAY FORESHADOW MORE PERVASIVE, AND MORE TROUBLING, SHIFTS IN THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, AND AMONG THE FEDERAL, JUDICIAL, LEGISLATIVE, AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES. IN PARTICULAR, THE COURT'S DUBIOUS REASONING IN SEMINOLE TRIBE MAY HAVE SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE FEDERAL COURTS' ABILITY TO ENJOIN STATE OFFICIALS FROM VIOLATING FEDERAL LAW IN THE FUTURE. THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH EQUITABLE RELIEF; UNDER THE SO-CALLED EX PARTE YOUNG DOCTRINE, HAS LONG BEEN ACCEPTED AS A NECESSARY COUNTERBALANCE TO THE STATES' ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY FROM FEDERAL JURISDICTION. WHILE THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON CONGRESS'S POWER WOULD SEEM TO MAKE THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH RELIEF MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEFORE, PROFESSOR JACKSON EXAMINES HOW THE COURT'S UNFORTUNATE ANALYSIS IN SEMINOLE TRIBE MAY PRESAGE A SUBSTANTIAL LIMITATION OF THE EX PARTE YOUNG DOCTRINE IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. PROFESSOR JACKSON CONCLUDES BY ARTICULATING THE DANGERS THAT SUCH A COURSE MIGHT POSE TO FEDERAL COURTS' ROLE IN MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SUPREMACY OF FEDERAL LAW.
713	DRAWING ON THE INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, THIS STUDY UTILIZES TEXTUAL ANALYSIS TO INTERROGATE THE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES FOR TWO AFRICAN NATIONS, KENYA AND RWANDA. COMPOSED OF THREE TENETS, SOCIAL INCLUSIVENESS, ECOLOGICAL INCLUSIVENESS AND RELATIONAL INCLUSIVENESS, THIS FRAMEWORK IS ROOTED IN THEORIES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. SOCIAL INCLUSIVENESS WAS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE FINDINGS VIS-A-VIS THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL IN DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS PROTECTION AND CAPACITY BUILDING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. HOWEVER, PARTICIPATORY PUBLIC PROCESSES AIMED AT PLURALIZING KNOWLEDGES THAT INFORM DEVELOPMENT WERE NOT SUPPORTED. EVIDENCE FOR ECOLOGICAL INCLUSIVENESS INCLUDED ACCOUNTS ON ECOLOGICAL LIMITS, JUST SHARING OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND PARTICIPATION OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. ACCOUNTS ON STEPS TAKEN TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENGAGE ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN MITIGATION WERE ABSENT. RELATIONAL INCLUSIVENESS INCLUDED DISCUSSIONS ON RULE OF LAW; HOWEVER, WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION, CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF TAXATION POLICIES AND PROTECTION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES FROM PRIVATIZATION WERE NOTABLY ABSENT. THE OMISSIONS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HISTORIES OF COLONIALISM AND NEOCOLONIAL REALITIES. ADVOCACY FOR LOCALLY DEFINED AND EQUITABLE APPROACHES TO DEVELOPMENT HAVE BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED GLOBALLY, PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA, THUS IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR THE TOURISM INDUSTRY TO ALIGN WITH THESE DECOLONIAL IDEALS.
714	WE ADD TO RECENT CALLS FOR MORE RESEARCH ON CORPORATE CORRUPTION AND ARGUE THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCHERS NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ENTREPRENEURS WHO ENGAGE IN ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES THAT CORRODE INSTITUTIONS AND UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW: WHAT WE CALL CORRUPT ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE CONCEPTUALISE CORRUPT ENTREPRENEURS AS INDIVIDUALS WHO SIMULTANEOUSLY ACT AS TRADITIONAL ENTREPRENEURS SEEKING OUT AND EXPLOITING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFIT FROM INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS; AS INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS THAT THEY PROFIT FROM; AND AS CULTURAL ENTREPRENEURS THAT DRAW ON VARIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCES TO LEGITIMATE THEMSELVES IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE DISCUSS THE SICILIAN MAFIA AND BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HOW THE EXISTENCE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL VOID PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF THE SICILIAN MAFIA, HOW IT CONTINUES TO PROFIT FROM INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS, WHAT IT DOES TO MAINTAIN THE VOIDS IT PROFITS FROM, AND HOW IT LEGITIMISES ITSELF IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BY HELPING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY MITIGATE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS THAT THEY ARE COMPLICIT IN CREATING AND MAINTAINING IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUILDING ON THIS DISCUSSION, WE HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANT FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH ON CORRUPT ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
715	UNITED NATIONS POLICE (UNPOL) HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PEACE OPERATIONS. FOR SOME TIME, THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO RE-ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES HAS BEEN SEEN AS A CORNERSTONE FOR BUILDING SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND ENABLING MISSION EXIT STRATEGIES. IN A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL PEACEKEEPING AND POST-CONFLICT ASSISTANCE, RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN UN PEACE OPERATIONS DIRECTED TO STABILISE COUNTRIES AND PROTECT CIVILIANS IN THE CONTEXT OF ON-GOING VIOLENT CONFLICT. AS A RESULT, UNPOL HAVE HAD TO UNDERTAKE A RANGE OF EXPANDED TASKS, EXACERBATING LONG-STANDING CHALLENGES AND PRODUCING NEW IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. AT THE SAME TIME, A 'PRAGMATIC TURN' IS GENERATING INCREASED INTEREST IN MORE POLICE-CENTRIC CONCEPTS OF PEACEKEEPING AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO TODAY'S EXPENSIVE AND MILITARY-FOCUSED PEACE OPERATIONS. DRAWING ON EXTENSIVE FIELDWORK IN MULTIPLE PEACE OPERATIONS AND AT UN HEADQUARTERS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CHANGING ROLES OF UNPOL IN A NEW BREED OF UN PEACE OPERATIONS, IDENTIFIES THE MAJOR ASSOCIATED CHALLENGES AND PROPOSES A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING THEM. IT ARGUES THAT IF POLICE ARE TO RESPOND TO UNFOLDING CHALLENGES WHILE BECOMING MORE CENTRAL TO PEACEKEEPING OUTCOMES, THEN SIGNIFICANT REFORMS AND FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THEIR IMPACTS WILL BE REQUIRED.
716	DO CONSTITUTIONS SERVE INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE? THE PAPER PROPOSES THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A PURELY LEGAL CONCEPT IN ORDER TO EXPLORE SATISFACTORY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW AND WHETHER A CONSTITUTION HELPS TO PROMOTE INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE. I ARGUE THAT THE NORMATIVE APPROACH CAN EXPLAIN THAT CONSTITUTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE MEANS OF APPROACHING (AS OPPOSED TO HINDERING) INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE. THE BINDING NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY OF SOME UNAMENDABLE PROVISIONS, IS ALREADY JUSTIFIED IN DOCTRINE AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF ALL NORMATIVE ORDERS. I ARGUE THAT THIS BOUNDARY NATURE IS NOT A HINDRANCE, BUT RATHER A HELPFUL REFERENCE POINT FOR ALL GENERATIONS IN THE ORGANISATION OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE. CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR INTERPRETATIONS BY JUDGES, PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE UNDERSTANDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS MIGHT CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF TIME AND SPACE, WHILE PRESERVING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE. I ARGUE THAT THE NORMATIVE APPROACH REQUIRES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THAT THE DECISIONS, JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTITUTION, BE REASONABLY JUSTIFIED TO THE GENERATION IN WHICH THE CASE ACTUALLY EMERGES. THAT ENABLES THE CONSTITUTION, WITH ITS UNAMENDABLE PROVISIONS, TO PROVIDE A STABLE FRAMEWORK THAT IS CAPABLE OF ADAPTING IN ORDER TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF FUTURE SOCIETIES.
717	THE JUNTA DE LA VICTORIA (VICTORY BOARD; 1941-1947) WAS AN ARGENTINE ANTIFASCIST WOMEN'S GROUP THAT SENT AID TO THE ALLIES. WITH ITS 45,000 MEMBERS, THE JUNTA BECAME THE LARGEST WOMEN'S POLITICAL GROUP BEFORE JUAN PERON'S PRESIDENCY (1946-1955), WHEN WOMEN OBTAINED SUFFRAGE (1947). UNLIKE OTHER WOMEN'S ANTI-FASCIST GROUPS IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA, THE JUNTA CONCENTRATED ON MODELING AND AMPLIFYING DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES IN THE FACE OF AN INCREASINGLY DICTATORIAL GOVERNMENT AND AXIS ADVANCES IN WORLD WAR II. THUS IT WAS UNIQUE. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE JUNTA TRIED TO IMPLEMENT A BROADER VIEW OF DEMOCRACY THAT WENT BEYOND PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, FREE ELECTIONS, AND THE RULE OF LAW TO INCLUDE MEN AND WOMEN OF DIFFERENT CLASSES, FAITHS, ETHNICITIES, AND REGIONS IN THE POLITY. ASIDE FROM HELPING THE ALLIES, IT MOBILISED A SPECTRUM OF WOMEN AND INSERTED THEM INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA, BRIDGED DIFFERENCES AMONG THEM, AND FOSTERED THEIR ENGAGEMENT. IT BROADLY DISSEMINATED ITS MESSAGE IN ORDER TO BRING THE MASSES INTO AN ANTI-FASCIST ORBIT. WHILE THE JUNTA SOUGHT TO RENOVATE A DEMOCRACY UNDER SIEGE, ITS CONCEPTION OF THIS TYPE OF GOVERNANCE HAD SOME SHORTCOMINGS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ARGENTINE CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT DIFFERENT CONTEXTS PRODUCED DIFFERENT ANTI-FASCISMS.
718	POULTRY PRODUCTION HAS ACHIEVED OUTSTANDING BIOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE LAST 60 YEARS AS EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP HARNESSED SCIENCE AND BUSINESS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, THUS CONTRIBUTING POWERFULLY TO CHEAP, ABUNDANT FOOD AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT UNACCEPTABLE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE NOW EVIDENT, ADDING TO THE THREATENED COLLAPSE IN WESTERN SOCIETY THAT IS BEING PROVOKED BY AN UNSUSTAINABLE CULTURE OF MATERIALISTIC CONSUMPTION AND SELF-INTEREST. A SUPREME DESIRE FOR PROFIT DOMINATES ALL PUBLIC DECISIONS AND RESOURCE USE. THE BALANCED MARKET ECONOMY SYSTEM HAS BEEN DISTORTED INTO 'ELITE CAPITALISM'. IN AGRICULTURE, THIS DEFORMED ECONOMIC MODEL COMBINED WITH 'ELITE SCIENCE' THREATENS BOTH FOOD SECURITY AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF WORLD SOCIETY. NOT ONLY ARE ESTABLISHED BOUNDARIES OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOUR BEING BREACHED BUT, IN THE PROCESS, TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES ARE BEING VIOLATED IN RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE, SPECIES INTEGRITY, COMMUNITY AND MORALITY. THE CURRENT ELITE SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MODEL IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND MUST BE RESHAPED BEFORE IT LEADS TO MAJOR CATASTROPHE. LEADERS IN THE POULTRY SECTOR ARE CHALLENGED TO AGAIN SHOW THEIR INNOVATION AND INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL COURAGE BY RE-DESIGNING THE POULTRY SECTOR AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE WHOLE FOOD CHAIN TO ENSURE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY, A SUSTAINABLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC FUTURE FOR BOTH RICH AND POOR AND THE SURVIVAL OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY.
719	STATES HAVE ADOPTED AMNESTIES/PARDONS CONCERNING SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS TO TRANSITION FROM CRISES, DICTATORSHIPS, OR CONFLICTS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING EUROPE. ALTHOUGH THE ECTHR HAS YET TO REVIEW AMNESTIES/PARDONS DIRECTLY, IT HAS INCREASINGLY DECIDED ON THE EFFECTS OF AMNESTIES/PARDONS ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. THUS, THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION HEREIN IS TO IDENTIFY WHICH FACTORS MAY DETERMINE WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE ECTHR DEFERS TO STATES REGARDING AMNESTIES/PARDONS IN CASES OF SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, NAMELY, FACTORS CONCERNING OR AFFECTING THE DEGREE OF ECTHR'S DEFERENCE TO STATES IN THESE CASES. BASED ON ECTHR'S JURISPRUDENCE ON AMNESTIES/PARDONS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES AND FINDS THAT THESE FACTORS GENERALLY ARE: THE NATIONAL PROCESS OF ADOPTION, APPLICATION, AND/OR VALIDATION OF AMNESTIES/PARDONS; CONSIDERATION OF THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION OR DISCRETION GIVEN TO STATES; STATE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS; AND POTENTIAL IMPACT ON TRANSITIONS TO PEACE, RECONCILIATION, DEMOCRACY, AND/OR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO FILL A GAP IN SCHOLARSHIP BY PROPOSING AN EXPLICIT, DETAILED, AND ANALYTICAL SYSTEMATIZATION OF FACTORS THAT, IN LIGHT OF ECTHR'S JURISPRUDENCE, MAY EXPLAIN WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE ECTHR DEFERS TO STATES IN CASES OF AMNESTIES/PARDONS CONCERNING SERIOUS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF ECTHR'S (EMERGING) JURISPRUDENTIAL TRENDS.
720	GROWING U.S.-CHINA RIVALRY UNDOUBTEDLY POSES A PROFOUND THREAT TO THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. IN "GOVERNING THE INTERFACE OF U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS," GREGORY SHAFFER PROVIDES A HIGHLY NUANCED AND BALANCED ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE OF THIS THREAT AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS IT. YET MANAGING TRADE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS, I ARGUE, ONLY ONE OF THE TWIN CHALLENGES CURRENTLY FACING THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. THE OTHER IS HOW TO REIN IN GROWING ECONOMIC COERCION AND THE ARBITRARY ABUSE OF POWER BY DOMINANT STATES IN THE SYSTEM. THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA HAVE EACH BECOME HIGHLY DISRUPTIVE FORCES IN THE LIBERAL TRADING ORDER-NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THEIR BILATERAL TRADE RELATIONS BUT ALSO, AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE OF THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARD THE REST OF THE WORLD. BOTH OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE INCREASINGLY TURNED AWAY FROM TRADE MULTILATERALISM AND TOWARD AGGRESSIVE UNILATERALISM AND THE RAW USE OF COERCIVE POWER IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH OTHER STATES. IT IS THIS FLAGRANT DISREGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW ON THE PART OF THE SYSTEM'S TWO DOMINANT POWERS THAT HAS THROWN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) INTO CRISIS AND ULTIMATELY POSES THE GREATEST THREAT TO THE GLOBAL TRADE REGIME.
721	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE 'IMMIGRANT-ABORIGINAL PARALLAX GAP' WHEREBY MATERIAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN IMMIGRATION AND INDIGENOUS DISPOSSESSION ARE RARELY EXAMINED IN TANDEM BY CONSIDERING WAYS IN WHICH THE CANADIAN MEDIA FRAMES INDIGENOUS PROTESTERS AND IRREGULAR ASYLUM SEEKERS. BUILDING ON THE WORK OF PREVIOUS STUDIES OF OKA/KANASATAKE, IPPERWASH AND CALEDONIA AND IRREGULAR BOAT ARRIVALS OF FUJIAN AND TAMIL ASYLUM SEEKERS, IT IDENTIFIES SIMILARITIES IN THE WAYS THAT EACH GROUP HAS BEEN RACIALIZED, CRIMINALIZED, DELEGITIMIZED AND CONSTRUCTED AS THE 'OTHER'. EMPLOYING THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OF SETTLER COLONIALISM AND SECURITIZATION THEORY, IT EXAMINES WHETHER THE SAME FRAMES PERSIST IN CONTEMPORARY REPRESENTATIONS USING THE CASE STUDIES OF WET'SUWET'EN PROTESTERS AND IRREGULAR ASYLUM SEEKERS CROSSING THE CANADA-US BORDER AT ROXHAM ROAD, QUEBEC. A COMPARATIVE DISCOURSE ANALYSIS FINDS THAT THE MEDIA CONTINUES TO FRAME INDIGENOUS PROTESTERS AND IRREGULAR ASYLUM SEEKERS AS THREATS TO THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND THE `COMMON GOOD'. THESE FRAMINGS DISCREDIT AND DELEGITIMIZE HUMAN RIGHTS CLAIMS THAT CHALLENGE THE LEGITIMACY OF SETTLER COLONIAL BORDERS - INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST AND TO CLAIM ASYLUM - TURNING THEM INTO THREATS TO CANADA'S SOVEREIGNTY, THUS NECESSITATING STATE ACTION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS DISCOURSE HAS THE EFFECT OF REPRODUCING THE RACIALIZED INJUSTICES AND INEQUALITIES OF ONGOING SETTLER COLONIALISM.
722	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE TEXT IS TO SERVE AS AN EDITORIAL TO THE EDITION VOLUME 40, NUMBER 72, JANUARY-JUNE 2022 OF POLITICAL ISSUES. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT IS AN EDITORIAL ESSAY OF A REFLECTIVE NATURE BASED ON DOCUMENTARY SOURCES CONSULTED IN DIGITAL FORMAT. THE CRISIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC MODEL IS IN SOME WAY A GLOBAL PHENOMENON THAT AFFECTS, TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT, ALL MODERN SOCIETIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE AS A FORM OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT DEMOCRACY, BEYOND ITS DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS AND MODALITIES, IS THE ONLY POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THE ENJOYMENT AND ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN A SOCIAL FRAMEWORK OF FREEDOM, QUALITY OF LIFE AND DIGNITY, BUT DESPITE ITS BENEFITS IT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM CONTRADICTIONS SUCH AS: THE CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION, THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE CORRUPTION OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LEADERSHIPS; THESE CONTRADICTIONS PUT AT STAKE THE LEGITIMACY OF THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND ALSO CREATE THE CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEO-POPULIST OR NEOCONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP THAT VINDICATE AUTHORITARIAN WAYS OF EXERCISING POWER TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
723	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO FIND THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAYS, FORMS AND METHODS OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ON THE INTERNET AMONG FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND LEGAL REALITIES. THE FOLLOWING METHODS WERE USED IN THE ARTICLE: DIALECTICAL, LOGICAL-SEMANTIC, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS, ANALYTICAL, INFORMATION-ANALYTICAL. ISSUES RELATED TO THE ADAPTATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE OF A NUMBER OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE FIELD OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ON THE INTERNET ARE BROUGHT UP FOR DISCUSSION. SOME OPTIONS ARE COVERED AND SPECIFIED, WHICH INCLUDE EFFECTIVE METHODS AND WAYS TO IMPLEMENT AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ON THE INTERNET IN UKRAINE. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE PROTECTION AND PROPER CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL DATA OF INDIVIDUALS IS ONE OF THE KEY TASKS CURRENTLY FACING MODERN JURISTS. IT IS ALSO ADDED THAT THE NATURE AND SPECIFICS OF THE USE AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA OF INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING ON THE INTERNET, ARE EXTREMELY CLOSELY RELATED TO THE INSTITUTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE FACT THAT THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA OF INDIVIDUALS IN A COUNTRY IS AN INDICATOR OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH A STATE MEETS THE CRITERIA OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
724	THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN INADEQUATE, BUT NOT ZERO. THERE ARE 1,800 CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS WORLDWIDE. WE USE PANEL DATA ON LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN 133 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1999-2016 TO IDENTIFY STATISTICALLY THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM IMPACT OF CLIMATE LEGISLATION. EACH NEW LAW REDUCES ANNUAL CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY 0.78% NATIONALLY IN THE SHORT TERM (DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS) AND BY 1.79% IN THE LONG TERM (BEYOND THREE YEARS). THE RESULTS ARE DRIVEN BY PARLIAMENTARY ACTS AND BY COUNTRIES WITH A STRONG RULE OF LAW. IN 2016, CURRENT CLIMATE LAWS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ANNUAL REDUCTION IN GLOBAL CO(2)EMISSIONS OF 5.9 GTCO(2), MORE THAN THE US CO(2)OUTPUT THAT YEAR. CUMULATIVE CO(2)EMISSIONS SAVINGS FROM 1999 TO 2016 AMOUNT TO 38 GTCO(2), OR ONE YEAR'S WORTH OF GLOBAL CO(2)OUTPUT. THE IMPACT ON OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES IS MUCH LOWER. CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS ARE SHOWN TO REDUCE NATIONAL CO(2)EMISSIONS BY 0.78% IN THEIR FIRST THREE YEARS AND 1.79% IN THE LONGER TERM. THESE REDUCTIONS ADD UP TO 38 GTCO(2)OF AVOIDED EMISSIONS FOR 1999-2016-EQUAL TO A YEAR OF CO(2)EMISSIONS.
725	DESPITE ABUNDANT ATTENTION TO THE JUDICIAL SELECTION OF U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, MOST FEDERAL LEGAL DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED IN THE LOWER FEDERAL COURTS. WHO THE JUDGES ARE AND HOW THEY MAKE THEIR DECISIONS MATTERS ENORMOUSLY IN A DEMOCRACY THAT VALUES THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ITS CITIZENS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. OUR FOCUS IN THIS STUDY IS ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPOINTMENTS TO THE LOWER FEDERAL BENCH. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE VARIOUS METHODS OF EXAMINING THE NUMBERS THAT OBAMA VALUED DIVERSITY - PERHAPS MORE SO THAN ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENT. WHEN WE EXAMINE ALL LOWER COURTS IN THE AGGREGATE, AND THEN DISTRICT AND CIRCUIT COURTS SEPARATELY, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL NOMINEES, THE REPLACEMENT PATTERNS FOR DEPARTING JUDGES, AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN ACTIVE AND SENIOR STATUS JUDGES, WE SEE A CONCERTED AND LARGELY SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO INCREASE SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY. UNDER DIFFERENT POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DATA WOULD LEAD US TO CONSIDER NOVEL COMPLEXITIES IN DIVERSIFYING THE FEDERAL BENCH IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BUT A TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND ITS EXPECTED FOCUS ON IDEOLOGY OVER DIVERSITY IS LIKELY TO LEAD THE STUDY OF JUDICIAL SELECTION IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.
726	PURPOSE THIS CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERCEPTUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY. TO DO SO, THE AUTHORS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, TAKING THE POSITION THAT THE CONCEPT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS NOT A MONOLITHIC ONE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS CONSTRUCT A LARGE CROSS-NATIONAL DATA SET AND EMPLOY HIERARCHICAL LINEAR MODELING (HLM) TO RUN A MULTI-LEVEL ANALYSIS ON INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA FROM GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) AND COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA FROM POLITY IV AND GLOBE, REPRESENTING 47 COUNTRIES. FINDINGS INDIVIDUALS' PERCEPTUAL CHARACTERISTICS (I.E. PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY, OPPORTUNITY PERCEPTION, AND FEAR OF FAILURE) AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE FORM OF SUPPORTIVE CULTURES IMPACT SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MORE STRONGLY THAN COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FORMAL INSTITUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, SPECIFICALLY THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTE TO THEORY BY ILLUMINATING THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL DECISIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS' MULTI-LEVEL MODEL CONTRIBUTES TO A MORE DETAILED CONCEPTUALIZATION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY BY IDENTIFYING INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS THAT FACILITATE COMMERCIAL VERSUS SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE AUTHORS ALSO CLARIFY WHY COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP ATTRACT DIFFERENT TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS.
727	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONSIDER THE SUCCESS AND FAILURE OF MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS IN GENERATING ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS AND PROPOSE A DUAL CRITERION OF EVALUATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IT SURVEYS THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON MICROFINANCE AND FINDS THAT WHILE THERE HAS BEEN SMALL AND LOCALIZED SUCCESS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO CREDIT, AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAS BEEN A BROADER FAILURE TO GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THIS BROADER FAILURE SHOULD BE VIEWED FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE OR THE LACK OF SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND STABLE RULE OF LAW WITHIN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FINDINGS USING BAUMOL'S (1968) THEORY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE BROADER FAILURE OF MICROFINANCE IS A CASE OF POOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY LEADING TO UNPRODUCTIVE OR EVEN DESTRUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP RATHER THAN PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE PAPER ALSO SUGGESTS A LINK BETWEEN THE LITERATURE CRITICIZING FOREIGN AID AND THIS VIEW ON MICROFINANCE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER PROVIDES A SURVEY OF THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON MICRO FINANCE AS WELL AS A NOVEL FRAMEWORK THAT AIDS IN UNDERSTANDING BOTH THE LOCALIZED SMALL-SCALE SUCCESS AS WELL AS BROADER FAILURE TO GENERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH.
728	THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES AN APPROACH TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THAT RECONCILES A MORE FORMALIST, CLASSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF LAW AND ITS SUPREMACY WITH THE CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. COURTS ADOPTING THIS APPROACH, WHICH I CALL "NEOCLASSICAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW," ARE SKEPTICAL OF JUDICIAL DEFERENCE ON QUESTIONS OF LAW, TEND TO GIVE MORE LEEWAY TO AGENCIES ON QUESTIONS OF POLICY, AND ATTEND MORE CLOSELY TO STATUTES GOVERNING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE THAN CONTEMPORARY DOCTRINE DOES. AS A RESULT, NEOCLASSICAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FINDS A PLACE FOR BOTH LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, WITHOUT SUBORDINATING EITHER OF THOSE CENTRAL VALUES TO THE OTHER. SUCH AN APPROACH RECONCILES TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE AND SEPARATION OF POWERS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE THAT CONGRESS HAS CHOSEN TO CONSTRUCT AND PROVIDES A CLEARER, MORE APPEALING ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN COURTS AND AGENCIES. THIS THEORY IS "CLASSICAL" IN ITS DEFENSE OF THE AUTONOMY OF LAW AND LEGAL REASONING, SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND THE SUPREMACY OF LAW. THESE COMMITMENTS DISTINGUISH IT FROM THEORISTS THAT WOULD HAVE COURTS MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL RETREAT IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT IS "NEW" IN THAT, UNLIKE OTHER MORE CLASSICAL CRITIQUES OF CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, IT SEEKS TO INTEGRATE THOSE MORE FORMALIST COMMITMENTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE WE HAVE TODAY - AND WILL HAVE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
729	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN COMBATING TRAFFICKING IS POOR DATA ON ITS NATURE AND SCOPE. ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE AND STILL TARGET RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY IS TO IDENTIFY KEY "PUSH AND PULL" FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRAFFICKING FROM ORIGIN COUNTRIES AND TO DESTINATION COUNTRIES. ONE UNDER-EXAMINED PUSH FACTOR IS THE OUTBREAK OF DISEASE. OUTBREAKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL WELL-DOCUMENTED TRAFFICKING RISK FACTORS, FROM THE BREAKDOWN OF RULE OF LAW AND INCREASE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY TO COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES AND DIMINISHED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. DISEASE OUTBREAKS CAN ALSO DISRUPT FAMILY TIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 2014 EBOLA OUTBREAK IN WEST AFRICA LEFT THOUSANDS OF ORPHANS AT INCREASED RISK OF EXPLOITATION. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES POSSIBLE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH OUTBREAKS COULD INCREASE TRAFFICKING RISK AND, USING DATA ON DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND TRAFFICKING ACROSS STATES OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES, PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A DISEASE OUTBREAK ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE TRAFFICKING OUTFLOWS. THE FINDINGS POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING TRAFFICKING PREVENTION INTO OUTBREAK RESPONSE AND CALL FOR A RESEARCH AGENDA MORE FULLY EXAMINING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN TRAFFICKING AND OUTBREAKS (AND POTENTIALLY OTHER TYPES OF NATURAL DISASTERS AS WELL).
730	INVASIVE SPECIES HAVE AN ENORMOUS GLOBAL IMPACT, WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE BEING THE LEADING PATHWAY FOR THEIR INTRODUCTION. CURRENT MULTINATIONAL TRADE DEALS UNDER NEGOTIATION WILL DRAMATICALLY CHANGE TRADING PARTNERSHIPS AND PATHWAYS. THESE CHANGES HAVE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS AND GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY. USING A DATABASE OF 47 328 INTERCEPTIONS SPANNING 10 YEARS, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS OF TRADING PARTNERS CAN PREDICT EXOTIC SPECIES INTERCEPTIONS. FOR IMPORT PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH VEGETABLE MATERIAL, A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RISK OF EXOTIC SPECIES INTERCEPTIONS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRIES THAT ARE POORLY REGULATED, HAVE MORE FOREST COVER AND HAVE SURPRISINGLY LOW CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION AND INDICATORS SUCH AS POLITICAL STABILITY OR ADHERENCE TO RULE OF LAW WERE IMPORTANT IN VEHICLE OR TIMBER IMPORT PATHWAYS. THESE RESULTS WILL BE OF CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO POLICY MAKERS, PRIMARILY BY SHIFTING QUARANTINE PROCEDURES TO FOCUS ON COUNTRIES OF HIGH RISK BASED ON THEIR SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. FURTHER, USING NEW ZEALAND AS AN EXAMPLE, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW A NINEFOLD REDUCTION IN INCURSIONS COULD BE ACHIEVED IF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS WERE USED TO SELECT TRADE PARTNERS. INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS THAT IGNORE GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS MAY FACILITATE INTRODUCTIONS AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS. DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE WITHIN COUNTRIES CLEARLY HAVE BIODIVERSITY IMPLICATIONS BEYOND BORDERS.
731	CONTRACT INTERPRETATION HAS BEEN A HOT TOPIC OF SCHOLARLY DEBATE SINCE 2003, WHEN PROFESSORS ALAN SCHWARTZ OF YALE AND ROBERT E. SCOTT OF COLUMBIA PUBLISHED THEIR PROVOCATIVE ARTICLE, CONTRACT THEORY AND THE LIMITS OF CONTRACT LAW, MUCH OF WHICH DEVELOPS AN EFFICIENCY THEORY OF CONTRACT INTERPRETATION. IN 2010, THEY PUBLISHED A RESTATEMENT OF THIS THEORY AND REPLY TO CRITICS, WHICH HAS NOT YET DRAWN MUCH COMMENTARY. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT, EVEN AS RESTATED, THEIR THEORY OFFERS AN OBJECT LESSON ON SOME LIMITS OF ECONOMIC ANALYSES OF THE LAW. THE ARTICLE ASSUMES THAT THEIR CENTRAL ARGUMENT IS MATHEMATICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IMPECCABLE. IT SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT THE THEORY NONETHELESS FAILS. THEIR CENTRAL ARGUMENT RESTS ON A NAIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE AND THE LEGAL CONTEXT OF CONTRACT INTERPRETATION. THEIR EFFICIENCY CLAIM NEGLECTS AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY THAT DOES NOT REST ON ECONOMICS, BUT THAT PROBABLY WOULD SUPPORT A MORE EFFICIENT LAW. AND THEIR BASIC PREMISE THAT EFFICIENCY SHOULD BE THE SOLE GOAL OF A LAW FOR BUSINESS CONTRACTS MAKES THE THEORY STRIKINGLY VULNERABLE. IN PARTICULAR, VIRTUALLY EVERYONE, SCHWARTZ AND SCOTT INCLUDED, AGREES THAT RULE OF LAW VALUES SHOULD CONSTRAIN ALL LAWS. WHEN CONSIDERED, HOWEVER, THEY DOOM SCHWARTZ AND SCOTT'S INTERPRETATION THEORY, AS THEY MAY DOOM ANY MONIST THEORY.
732	THE INTERNET HAS CREATED A NEW COST-IMPLOSIVE ECONOMIC FOR LONG DISTANCE INTERACTION AND THE CREATION OF GLOBAL ORGANIZATIONS. A GUIDING VISION FOR INTERNET GOVERNANCE IS PROPOSED, BASED IN THAT ECONOMIC, AND THE RESULTANT EMERGING GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY. NEW ORGANIZATIONS AND GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY WILL CHALLENGE EXISTING RULE OF LAW, TRADITIONS, AND CULTURE FAR MORE THAN THE INTERNET DOES TODAY. THE EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL ACTIVISTS IN CENTRAL EUROPE DURING THE 1980S. IN ACTING TO BRING A CIVIL SOCIETY INTO EXISTENCE, SHOWS THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS MODEL. USING THESE CONCEPTS AS A GUIDE, PARTICIPANTS IN INTERNET GOVERNANCE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS TREND, DISCOVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES;;; IT PRESENTS, AND ENCOURAGE THE FURTHER CREATION OF A WORLDWIDE INTERNET CONSTITUENCY OF TECHNICAL AND POLICY EXPERTS TO REINFORCE, EXPLOIT, AND FURTHER DEVELOP IT. NEW TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE ''DEPLOYMENT-PROPAGATION'' MODEL, AND THUS TO TEST TECHNICAL VALIDITY THROUGH REAL-WORLD USE. THE INTERNET PROCESS AND ITS PARTICIPANT GROUPS SHOULD ''DE-AMERICANIZE'' IN ORDER TO INNOVATE MORE AND TO ENSURE ADOPTION BY THE WORLD AT LARGE. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD CAUSE THE INTERNET TO LOSE ITS FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTER, FOLLOWED BY THE LOSS OF ITS TREMENDOUS PROMISE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS.
733	WHILE RECENT SCHOLARSHIP HAS TURNED TO THE INCREASING FRAGMENTATION OF GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSES, THE OFTEN COMPETING IDEOLOGICAL PROJECTS IN WHICH DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE EMBEDDED HAVE RECEIVED COMPARATIVELY SCANT ATTENTION. INSTEAD, HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TREATED AS ISOLATED NORMS. ALTHOUGH TREATED AS ISOLATED, HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS ARE FREQUENTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERSTOOD AGAINST THE IMPLICIT BACKDROP OF LIBERAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL ORDER AND HUMAN AGENCY, THEREBY OBSCURING ALTERNATIVE HUMAN RIGHTS CONCEPTIONS. THIS RESEARCH NOTE SEEKS TO MOVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN RIGHTS BEYOND THE LIBERAL SCRIPT. DRAWING ON ADVANCES IN THE FIELDS OF INTELLECTUAL HISTORY AND POLITICAL THEORY, IT DEVELOPS A MORPHOLOGICAL APPROACH THAT TREATS NORMS NOT ONLY AS INDIVIDUAL STANDARDS OF APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BUT AS COMPLEX UNITS OF MEANINGS. THESE MEANINGS ONLY EMERGE IN LARGER IDEATIONAL FORMATIONS IN WHICH VARYING NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TEMPORARILY FIXED THROUGH THEIR POSITIONING TOWARD OTHER CONCEPTS. THIS MORPHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS PART OF LARGER CONCEPTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ALLOWS FOR THEIR ANALYSIS BEYOND THE LIBERAL SCRIPT AS THE RESEARCH NOTE SHOWS BY WAY OF TWO ILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDIES, WHICH FOCUS ON HUMAN RIGHTS BEYOND LIBERAL NOTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS BEYOND THE HUMAN AS ONTOLOGICALLY SINGULAR.
734	THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE DETERMINANTS OF MACROECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GLOBAL SUKUK MARKET BY CONTROLLING THE EFFECTS OF POPULATION. THIS STUDY USES PANEL DATA NAMELY GDP PER-CAPITA, EXCHANGE RATE, AND INFLATION AS THE PROXIES FOR MACROECONOMIC STABILITY SOURCED FROM THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDEX, AND SIX DIMENSIONS OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) AS INSTITUTIONAL PROXIES SOURCED FROM WGI-WORLD BANK. TO MAKE ROBUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MACROECONOMICS AND INSTITUTIONAL ON THE GLOBAL SUKUK MARKET, THE POPULATION (POP) VARIABLE WAS INCLUDED AS A CONTROL VARIABLE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUKUK USES A PROXY FOR SUKUK ISSUANCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FINANCIAL MARKET, FOR THE ANNUAL PERIOD FROM 2002-2017. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED USING THE GENERAL METHOD OF MOMENT, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT BY CONTROLLING THE POPULATION EFFECTS THAT PROVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT, GDP PER-CAPITA AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUKUK, ESPECIALLY WHEN INCORPORATING POPULATION EFFECTS AS CONTROL VARIABLES, WHEREBY FURTHER ASCERTAINING THE EFFECT OF EACH MACROECONOMIC-STABILITY VARIABLE AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY ON SUKUK DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY INFLATION, FOUND NOT TO AFFECT SUKUK DEVELOPMENT. THESE RESULTS ALSO CONFIRM THE PREVIOUS FINDINGS, WHEREBY INFLATION REMAINS CONTROLLABLE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
735	THIS STUDY AIMS TO CONSTRUCT A COMPOSITE INDEX FOR MEASURING THE VULNERABILITY TO RESOURCE CURSE IN SELECTED RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIVERSE FACTORS, RANGING FROM ECONOMIC TO GOVERNMENTAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL, THAT AFFECT THE RESOURCE CURSE PHENOMENON AND ITS IMPACTS. THE PROPOSED RESOURCE CURSE VULNERABILITY INDEX (RCVI) IS BASED ON 9 SUB-INDICATORS, NAMELY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, NATURAL RESOURCES RENT, GDP GROWTH, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT LEVEL, TRANSPARENCY LEVEL AND STATE FRAGILITY INDEX. WE PERFORM THE CALCULATIONS AND PRESENT THE RCVI VALUES OF 55 COUNTRIES IN THE TIME INTERVAL FROM 2005 TO 2015. THIS STUDY ALSO PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE RCVI VALUES AND RANKINGS FOR THE COUNTRIES OVER THE ASSOCIATED TIME INTERVAL. THESE RESULTS POINT TO A CLUSTERING OF THE COUNTRIES: A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS LOW-RCVI COUNTRIES THAT ARE PRINCIPALLY NOT VULNERABLE TO THE RESOURCE CURSE, WHEREAS A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE HIGH-RCVI COUNTRIES WHO SUFFER HEAVILY FROM THE RESOURCE CURSE. THE MORE INTERESTING GROUP IS THE MEDIUM-RCVI COUNTRIES THAT SHARE GEOGRAPHICAL AND CULTURAL ASPECTS WITH HIGH-RCVI COUNTRIES, HOWEVER, HAVE ACHIEVED SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER PERFORMANCES, BY TAKING APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS THEIR INTERNAL STABILITY AS WELL AS ECONOMIC SITUATIONS.
736	IF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY OPERATES TO OBSCURE FROM PARLIAMENT THE COMMON LAW (RIGHTS) BACKDROP AGAINST WHICH IT LEGISLATES, THE CLARITY OR RIGHTS-SENSITIVITY OF THAT LEGISLATION CANNOT BE IMPROVED. THIS UNDERCUTS, RATHER THAN PROMOTES, THE DEMOCRATIC AND RULE OF LAW VALUES THAT UNDERPIN THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE AND ITS CONTEMPORARY NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION. SO THE COURTS MUST STRIVE TO GIVE PARLIAMENT THE CLEAREST POSSIBLE PICTURE AS TO THE CONTENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL COMMON LAW RIGHTS IT SEEKS TO PROTECT AND, DEPENDING ON THE RIGHT, FREEDOM, OR PRINCIPLE IN LEGISLATIVE PLAY, THE STRENGTH WITH WHICH THE PRINCIPLE WILL BE APPLIED IN ORDER TO DO SO. PARLIAMENT (AND PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL) CAN ONLY ` SQUARELY CONFRONT' THOSE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THE EXISTENCE AND CONTENT OF WHICH WAS KNOWN AT THE TIME OF LEGISLATING. THE PROPOSITION WHICH, NECESSARILY, FOLLOWS IS THAT THE RULE OF CONTEMPORANEA EXPOSITION EST OPTIMA ET FORTISSIMO IN LEGE MUST BE REVIVED WHEN JUDGES APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES. IF THE COURTS ARE TO MAINTAIN AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THE NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRINCIPLE THEN ITS APPLICATION TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES CAN ONLY OPERATE TO PROTECT FROM LEGISLATIVE ENCROACHMENT THOSE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS EXISTING AT THE TIME THE STATUTE WAS ENACTED.
737	IN JUNE 2013, EXPLOSIVE CLAIMS AND ILLICIT REVELATIONS OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS, HACKING, AND COLLABORATION WITH US INTERNET AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BEHEMOTHS ROCKED THE WORLD. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE MYSTERIOUS EMERGENCE IN THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (HKSAR) OF RUNAWAY AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE CONTRACTOR EDWARD J. SNOWDEN AT THE HEART OF THE INTRIGUE SHOVED THE SMALL ENCLAVE TO THE FORE OF GLOBAL GEOPOLITICS. CLAIMING TO RELY ON HONG KONG'S RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND TRADITION OF DISSENT TO SHIELD HIM AGAINST AMERICAN RETALIATION AND EXTRADITION, THE DUBIOUS PROTAGONIST'S STATEMENTS INGRATIATED HIMSELF TO LOCAL POLITICAL GROUPS WHO PETITIONED HONG KONG AND CENTRAL CHINESE GOVERNMENTS NOT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE UNITED STATES. DURING "DEFEND SNOWDEN" DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE US CONSULATE IN HONG KONG INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF SUPPORTERS, PLACARDS BEARING THE IMAGE OF US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA PARODIED, MOCKED, AND RIDICULED THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD USING ICONIC ADAPTATIONS OF CAPTAIN AMERICA, GEORGE ORWELL'S "BIG BROTHER," AND SHEPARD FAIREY'S OBAMA "HOPE" VISUALS. INSTEAD OF AN ICON OF "AMERICAN FREEDOM AND IDEOLOGY" (SERWER 2008) AND AN "IDEALIZED AMERICAN NATION" (DITTMER 2005, 627) CAPTAIN AMERICA, AMERICAN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WERE SYMBOLICALLY TRANSFORMED INTO A SIGNIFIED ORWELLIAN CAPED CRUSADER THREATENING THE WORLD.
738	DIGITAL TELECOMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY HAS EXPANDED THE POTENTIAL OF THE MOBILE PHONE TO BE USED INCREASINGLY AS A WEAPON AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND CENSORSHIP. SINCE THE CONTENT OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION IS UNPREDICTABLE AND UNREGULATED, MOBILE PHONES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO BREACH STATE-SPONSORED BLOCKAGE OF INFORMATION. THIS IN TURN HELPS THE CHINESE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER, RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, AND MAKE POLITICAL WAVES IN AN AGGRESSIVE BATTLE FOR CONTROL OVER INFORMATION. THIS PAPER EXAMINES SPONTANEOUS MOBILIZATION VIA MOBILE PHONES, WITH A FOCUS ON TWO CONCRETE POPULAR PROTESTS IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, DEMONSTRATING HOW CHINESE CITIZENS HAVE EXPANDED THE POLITICAL USES OF MOBILE PHONES IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION FLOW, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE SEEKING TO BUILD AN INEXPENSIVE COUNTER-PUBLIC SPHERE. THESE PROCESSES DESTABILIZE CHINA'S CONVENTIONAL NATIONAL PUBLIC SPHERE BY SHAPING POLITICAL IDENTITIES ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AS WELL AS THE NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP WITHIN THE EVOLVING COUNTER-PUBLIC SPHERE. THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF MOBILE PHONES IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA'S POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CAN BE OBSERVED BY VARIOUS SOCIAL FORCES THAT COMMUNICATE THEIR STRUGGLES WITH THE AID OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, POSE CHALLENGES IN GOVERNANCE, AND FORCE THE AUTHORITIES TO ENGAGE IN NEW KINDS OF MEDIA PRACTICES.
739	EMER DE VATTEL (1714-1767), IN HIS INFLUENTIAL WORK THE LAW OF NATIONS, ESTABLISHED A NEW INTERNATIONAL STATIST PARADIGM WHICH BROKE WITH THE CLASSICAL PARTITION OF THE LAW INTO THE THREE REALITIES OF 'PERSONS, THINGS AND ACTIONS' (PERSONAE, RES, ACTIONES). THIS NEW PARADIGM SUBSTITUTED THE STATE FOR THE PERSON, DOWNGRADED THE GENERIC CONCEPT OF 'THINGS' TO THE OBLIGATIONS AMONG STATES IN THEIR RELATIONS, AND CHANGED THE FOCUS OF THE CONCEPT OF 'ACTION' TO THAT OF 'WAR' AS A LEGAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS BETWEEN AND AMONG STATES. THIS INTERNATIONAL PARADIGM (OR STATIST PARADIGM) HAS SURVIVED ALMOST UP TO OUR TIME IN INTERNATIONAL PRAXIS. NONETHELESS, TODAY THE STATIST PARADIGM APPEARS TO BE IN EVERY WAY INSUFFICIENT, SINCE IT DOES NOT CONSIDER HUMANITY AS A GENUINE POLITICAL COMMUNITY, NOR DOES IT REFLECT THE THREE-DIMENSIONALITY OF THE GLOBAL LAW PHENOMENON. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LAW THAT GOVERNS OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (INTERNATIONAL LAW) INTO A LAW THAT IS CAPABLE OF PROPERLY ORDERING THE NEW GLOBAL HUMAN COMMUNITY (GLOBAL LAW) DEMANDS THE CREATION OF A NEW PARADIGM, ORIGINATING IN THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTUAL TRIAD: GLOBAL HUMAN COMMUNITY, GLOBAL ISSUES, AND GLOBAL RULE OF LAW. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS NEW GLOBAL PARADIGM, COSMOPOLITAN CONSTITUTIONALISM COULD PLAY A KEY ROLE.
740	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE ALLEGED LINK BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 27 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 1984-2003. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - FOUR INSTITUTIONS' QUALITY INDICATORS, NAMELY GOVERNMENT STABILITY, CORRUPTION, ETHNIC TENSIONS AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH OTHER CONTROL AND POLICY VARIABLES, ARE EMPLOYED IN A PANEL DATA ANALYSIS. FINDINGS - THE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ASSUME A KEY ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHEREAS THE CONTROL VARIABLES DISPLAY A LIMITED EFFECT. THUS, THE "CONVENTIONAL VARIABLES" OF ECONOMIC THEORY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY EXPLAIN THE SSA EXPERIENCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - FUTURE RESEARCH EFFORTS SHOULD EXPLORE HOW THE VAST CHANGES EXPERIENCED BY THE COUNTRIES IN THAT REGION INFLUENCED THEIR ECONOMIC EVOLUTION DURING THE LAST DECADES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS -POLICY MAKERS SHOULD PRIMARILY FOCUS ON IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, WHICH IS LIKELY TO POSITIVELY AFFECT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN SSA COUNTRIES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE (ENHANCING RULE OF LAW AND QUALITY REGULATION, IMPROVING CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, SECURING PROPERTY RIGHTS AND REDUCING UNCERTAINTY) PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DELIVERING LONG-RUN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL PROSPERITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE USING DATA FROM 27 SSA COUNTRIES.
741	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THREE QUESTIONS: WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF 'DEMOCRATIC' INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES IN RUSSIA'S AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM; HOW DO THESE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES RESONATE WITH RUSSIAN PUBLIC OPINION; AND HOW DO THEY RELATE TO THE INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRACY-PROMOTION EFFORT IN THE COUNTRY? DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE MORE THAN A FACADE, A LEGITIMIZING ROLE TO PLAY UNDER AUTHORITARIANISM. THEY ARE RELEVANT TO THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONING OF THE REGIME. STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS IN RUSSIA SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN EXCLUSIVELY DICHOTOMOUS TERMS. THIS WOULD UNDERESTIMATE THE MEASURE OF POPULAR LEGITIMACY OF THE INCUMBENT REGIME IN RUSSIA, AS IT MISINTERPRETS POPULAR PERCEPTIONS OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY. RUSSIANS DEPLORE THEIR LACK OF INFLUENCE OVER WHAT HAPPENS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY; THEY ARE STRONGLY DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION, BUT THEY DO NOT TRANSLATE THIS INTO A WIDELY SHARED COMMITMENT TO CIVIL LIBERTIES. JUDGING FROM REGIME FEATURES AND POPULAR OPINION IN RUSSIA, THE POOR RECORD OF INTERNATIONAL DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE IN RUSSIA MAY NOT COME AS A SURPRISE. COMPARED WITH 'TRADITIONAL' DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE, RULE OF LAW SUPPORT CORRESPONDS MORE CLOSELY WITH THE (LIMITED) CAPABILITIES OF EXTERNAL ACTORS, WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE RUSSIAN CITIZENS AS WELL AS WITH THE SELF-DECLARED AMBITIONS AND INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS OF THE RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP.
742	IN TERMS OF PRINCIPLE, THE INTRINSIC STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM OF CHINESE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPONENTS: THE POSITIVE LAW (DE LEGE LATA) SYSTEM, THE THEORETICAL SYSTEM AND THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGY. AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM, POSITIVE LAW MAINLY CONSISTS OF THE NORMATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW; AS THE HEART OF THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM, THE THEORETICAL SYSTEM CONTAINS THE THEORETICAL BASIS, THE SYSTEM OF BASIC PRINCIPLES AND THE SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW; AND THE SYSTEM OF METHODOLOGY IS THE LINK AND THE CONVERSION MECHANISM BETWEEN POSITIVE LAW AND THE THEORETICAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE THREE RESEARCH METHODS OF POLITICO-LEGAL JURISPRUDENCE, RECHTSDOGMATIK (LEGAL DOGMATICS) AND SOCIAL SCIENCE JURISPRUDENCE. ALONG WITH INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE AND THE DEEPENING OF DOCTRINE OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS SINCE THE PROMULGATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE LAW (1989), THE ACADEMIC SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN CHINA HAS BEEN MATURING. HOWEVER, WE ARE CONSCIOUS THAT PROBLEMS STILL EXIST. THE BASIC APPROACH TO ACHIEVING FURTHER INNOVATION INCLUDES ADVANCING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BASIC ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THROUGH CODIFICATION; ENHANCING ACADEMIC QUALITY BY JURISPRUDENTIAL THINKING; SHAPING CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BY RULE OF LAW PRACTICE; AND CARRYING FORWARD THE WHOLE ACADEMIC SYSTEM IN A COMPLETE FORM.
743	A COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WHICH DRIVES ECONOMIC GROWTH. ENCOURAGING A MINIMUM LEVEL OF CERTAINTY IN AMBIGUOUS ENVIRONMENTS CHARACTERIZED BY RISK TAKING IS IMPORTANT. AWARE OF THIS IMPORTANCE, WE ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE ANALYZE POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, A ROBUST RULE OF LAW, THE EASE OF STARTING A NEW BUSINESS, AND THE EASE OF OBTAINING CREDIT. WE DEVELOP TWO MODELS TO EXPLAIN THE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. TO DO SO, WE APPLY QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (QCA) TO A SAMPLE OF 48 COUNTRIES USING DATA SOURCED FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR AND THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE LEVEL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP VARIES ACCORDING TO THE SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH COUNTRY. THEY SUGGEST THAT A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS LEAD TO THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ALTHOUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAN BE FOUND IN UNFAVORABLE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXAMINE HOW TO FORMALIZE SUCH ENVIRONMENTS AS A STANDARDIZED INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATION TO SHIFT FROM NECESSITY TO OPPORTUNITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ACHIEVING THIS SHIFT IS RELEVANT FOR INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. (C) 2021 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER ESPANA, S.L.U. ON BEHALF OF AEDEM.
744	IN THIS ARTICLE, I SUGGEST CONSIDERING LINKAGES OF A THEORETICAL, AND CONTINUITIES OF A SOCIOLOGICAL NATURE BETWEEN ON THE ONE HAND, THE CONCEPT AND THE PRACTICAL USE OF SOCIALIST LEGALITY IN SOCIALIST HUNGARY-WITH PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE JUDICIAL REFORM OF 1954-AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AS IT HAS DEVELOPED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW IN HUNGARY, WITH PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE PERIOD SINCE THE 2011 JUDICIAL REFORM. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS SURPRISING SIMILARITIES IN THE POLITICALLY DETERMINED LEGISLATIVE INTENTION IN THESE TWO PERIODS TO FORM EMBRACING, QUASI LEGAL CONCEPTS, WHICH IN THEMSELVES SEEM TO DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY, ALTHOUGH THE SIMILARITIES IN THEIR NATURE AND IN THE SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE ARE ATTENTION-GRABBING. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ROLE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS, AND ESPECIALLY THE JUDICIAL ROLE, LEAD ONE TO THINK THAT DESPITE THE EXPLICIT REJECTION OF THE SOCIALIST ERA IN ARTICLE U) OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW IN HUNGARY, THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL REGIME HAS FAMILIAR ATTITUDES TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN PROMOTING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE NEW, SUPRA LEGAL CONCEPTS OF A TRANSFORMATIVE NATURE, WHICH, HOWEVER, ARE FILLED IN WITH THE RULING POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, WHETHER IT BE SOCIALIST LEGALITY OR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY.
745	NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY HAS BEEN THE KEY CONSIDERATION FOR BASING JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION ON MUTUAL RECOGNITION. MORE THAN ONE DECADE AFTER THE CREATION OF THE AREA OF FREEDOM SECURITY AND JUSTICE (AFSJ), THIS CONTRIBUTION ASSESSES WHETHER MUTUAL RECOGNITION-BASED EU LEGISLATION IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW INDEED RESPECTS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. TO THIS END, IT STUDIES THE FRAMEWORK DECISION ON THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW), THE EU'S FLAGSHIP INSTRUMENT IN THE AFSJ. WE DISTINGUISH TWO ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY: (A) THE PROTECTION OF THE STATE AND ITS BASIC STRUCTURES (ITS STATEHOOD); (B) THE STATE'S VALUES, PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ITS STATEHOOD PRINCIPLES), AND ASSESS THE EAW FROM A DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVE: FROM ITS INITIAL INCEPTION, IN WHICH MUTUAL TRUST PRIMARILY IMPLIED LITTLE INTERFERENCES WITH THE LAWS AND PRACTICES OF ISSUING STATES, TO THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH IS MARKED BY WHAT COULD BE CALLED A 'MUTUAL TRUST SUPPORTED BY HARMONIZATION'- APPROACH. ESPECIALLY IN THE JUDGE-DRIVEN HARMONIZATION OF THE EAW AND THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES WE WITNESS IMPORTANT (AND OFTENTIMES OVERLOOKED) ELEMENTS THAT IMPACT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. AT THE END, THE FINDINGS OF THE ARTICLE ARE PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN THE EU.
746	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE COMMON, YET PREVIOUSLY OPAQUE, PRACTICE OF USING FOREIGN AUDIT FIRMS (COMPONENT AUDITORS) TO CONDUCT PORTIONS OF AUDIT WORK FOR U.S. PUBLIC COMPANIES. U.S. REGULATORS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THE TRANSPARENCY AND QUALITY OF AUDITS USING COMPONENT AUDITORS. EMPLOYING DATA DISCLOSED IN THE NEWLY MANDATED PCAOB FORM AP, WE FIND THAT COMPONENT AUDITOR USE IS LARGELY STRUCTURAL, DETERMINED BY THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF CLIENTS' MULTINATIONAL OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT FIND THAT THE MERE USE OF COMPONENT AUDITORS IS DETRIMENTAL TO AUDIT OUTCOMES, BUT RATHER THEAMOUNTOF WORK CONDUCTED BY COMPONENT AUDITORS IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER AUDIT QUALITY (I.E., HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF MISSTATEMENT), HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF NONTIMELY REPORTING, AND HIGHER AUDIT FEES, WHICH COLLECTIVELY SUGGEST THAT COMPONENT AUDITOR ENGAGEMENTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT ONLY THE WORK PERFORMED BY LESS COMPETENT COMPONENT AUDITORS AND THOSE FACING GEOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL/LANGUAGE BARRIERS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL DISTANCE, WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND LOW ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE AUDIT OUTCOMES. OVERALL, THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE INITIAL ARCHIVAL EVIDENCE THAT THE USE OF CERTAIN COMPONENT AUDITORS ON U.S. MULTINATIONAL AUDITS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AUDIT COORDINATION ISSUES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT PCAOB FORM AP DISCLOSURES PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION.
747	THERE IS A REGULAR EMPHASIS ON THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS FAVOURABLE RELATIONSHIP HAS INDUCED MANY GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT POLICIES INTENDED TO INCREASE FDI INFLOWS AND, THEREBY, TO CREATE CONDUCIVE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES (MNES). THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM (EF) AND ITS SUB-COMPONENTS REFLECTING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS (QIS) ON FDI INFLOWS, USING INDICES DERIVED FROM THE FRASER INSTITUTE AND FROM THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT FOR A PANEL DATASET USING DIFFERENT ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGIES AND EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATIONS. THE RESULTS UNDERLINE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF EF ON FDI INFLOWS. THEY REVEAL THAT EF SUB-COMPONENTS HAVE VARYING IMPACTS ON FDI INFLOWS, WHERE RULE OF LAW, MARKET OPENNESS, AND LESS-RESTRICTIVE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT STAND OUT AS THE MAJOR FDI-PROMOTING INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. ALSO, THERE IS AN EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE EFFECTS OF EF SUB-COMPONENTS ON FDI INFLOWS EXHIBIT VARIATIONS THROUGH THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOST COUNTRIES AND ACROSS GEO-ECONOMIC REGIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD PURSUE EF-IMPROVING POLICIES, WHICH SHOULD BE TAILORED ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC AND GEO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOST COUNTRIES, TO INCREASE FDI INFLOWS.
748	WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS UPON LIFE INSURANCE DEMAND FOR 32 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, CONSIDERING THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS AS CONTROL VARIABLES. USING A PANEL DATA APPROACH, WE FIND THAT LIFE INSURANCE DEMAND IS INFLUENCED DIFFERENTLY BY INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS FROM THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS DATABASE, IN EMERGING AND TRANSITION MARKETS COMPARED TO DEVELOPED ONES. THE SOUND LEGAL ENVIRONMENT OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHERE THE LEVEL OF THE RULE OF LAW IS VERY HOMOGENEOUS AND VERY HIGH, MAKES IT NON-SIGNIFICANT FOR LIFE INSURANCE DEMAND. FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THE ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS, THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE TIME EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE DECISION OF CITIZENS TO BUY LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE EFFECT OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION OVER LIFE INSURANCE DENSITY VARIES ACROSS THESE TWO CATEGORIES OF COUNTRIES. FOR TRANSITION AND EMERGING MARKETS WE FIND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIFE INSURANCE DENSITY, INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND LEVEL OF URBANISATION. IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVELS OF INCOME, LIFE INSURANCE BECAME A COMMON GOOD, NOT A LUXURY ONE, WHICH MAKES INCOME DISTRIBUTION AN INSIGNIFICANT FACTOR. FOR EMERGING AND TRANSITION COUNTRIES POLICYMAKERS SHOULD CONCENTRATE MORE ON STRENGTHENING TRUST IN THE INSURANCE SECTOR FOR REDUCING THE GAP WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
749	WITH RESPONSES TO URBAN VIOLENCE RECEIVING INCREASING ACADEMIC ATTENTION, THE LITERATURE ON ANTI-GANG EFFORTS IN LATIN AMERICA HAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON COERCIVE MANO DURA POLICIES AND COOPERATIVE GANG TRUCES. YET, THERE REMAINS A PAUCITY OF STUDIES GOING BEYOND SUCH CARROTS- AND-STICKS APPROACHES TOWARDS GANGS. TO FILL THIS GAP, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF SUBSTITUTIVE SECURITY GOVERNANCE ACROSS LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILISATION AND REINTEGRATION (DDR) PROGRAMMES IN MEDELLIN, ARMED VIOLENCE REDUCTION AND PREVENTION (AVRP) EFFORTS IN HAITI AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) IN GUATEMALA AND RIO DE JANEIRO. IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT COMMUNITIES ARE DRIVEN TO SUPPORT GANGS AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE STATE WHEN THEY ARE INDISCRIMINATELY TARGETED THROUGH MUSCULAR OPERATIONS. LIKEWISE, ENGAGING GANGS IN DIALOGUE GRANTS THEM LEGITIMACY AND FURTHER WEAKENS THE POSITION OF THE STATE. THEREFORE, THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION LIES IN SUBSTITUTIVE SECURITY GOVERNANCE, WHICH AIMS TO REPLACE THE FUNCTIONS GANGS FULFIL FOR THEIR MEMBERS, SPONSORS, AND THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY ARE NESTED WITH A MODERN AND ACCOUNTABLE STATE THAT IS BOUND BY THE RULE OF LAW. STILL, SUBSTITUTIVE STRATEGIES VIS-A-VIS GANGS HAVE THEIR OWN LIMITATIONS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME BY WAY OF AN INTEGRATED AND COORDINATED FRAMEWORK.
750	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN AID ON GOVERNANCE IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE DEBATE ON FOREIGN AID AND TO VERIFY COMMON POSITIONS FROM MOYO'S 'DEAD AID', COLLIER'S 'BOTTOM BILLION' AND EUBANK'S 'SOMALILAND'. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON UPDATED DATA FROM 52 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2010. AN ENDOGENEITY ROBUST INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TWO-STAGE-LEAST SQUARES EMPIRICAL STRATEGY IS EMPLOYED. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE DETERIORATES ECONOMIC (REGULATION QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS) AND INSTITUTIONAL (CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW) GOVERNANCE, BUT HAS AN INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON POLITICAL (POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) GOVERNANCE. WHILE, THESE FINDINGS ARE BROADLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH MOYO AND COLLIER ON WEAK GOVERNANCE, THEY NEITHER CONFIRM THE EUBANK POSITION ON POLITICAL GOVERNANCE NOR THE ASONGU STANCE ON THE AID-CORRUPTION NEXUS IN A DEBATE WITH OKADA AND SAMRETH. THE USE OF FOREIGN AID AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INFLUENCE THE ELECTION AND REPLACEMENT OF POLITICAL LEADERS IN AFRICA MAY HAVE INSIGNIFICANT RESULTS. IT IS TIME TO SOLVE THE SECOND TRAGEDY OF FOREIGN AID AND THAT ECONOMISTS AND POLICY MAKERS START RETHINKING THE MODELS AND THEORIES ON WHICH FOREIGN AID IS USED TO INFLUENCE ECONOMIC, INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES.
751	THE PRESUMPTION THAT ALL EU MEMBER STATES ARE SAFE COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN CONSTITUTES A VITAL PART OF THE SELF-IMAGE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE POSSIBILITIES OPEN TO AN EU CITIZEN SEEKING ASYLUM IN ANOTHER EU COUNTRY ARE LIMITED. THE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES, HOWEVER, REVEALS THAT FOR SOME OF THEIR CITIZENS THIS IMAGE IS NOT A TRUE REPRESENTATION. PERHAPS THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE, THOUGH NOT THE ONLY ONE, IS THE PLIGHT OF THE ROMA MINORITY. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE RIGHT TO ASYLUM AND ITS LIMITED SCOPE WITHIN THE EU CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE PREDICAMENT OF THE ROMA, AS WELL AS RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN EUROPE (WHERE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN CONSTRAINED), PROVIDES GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGING SUCH A PRESUMPTION OF SAFETY AND FOR RECOGNIZING THAT EU CITIZENS COULD HAVE VALID CLAIMS FOR PROTECTION. THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO EXPLORE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES FOR SAFEGUARDING EU CITIZENS. IT ASSERTS THAT RECENT CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION COURT OF JUSTICE ON THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS IN SO-CALLED DUBLIN CASES OPENS UP FRESH POSSIBILITIES FOR ASYLUM CLAIMS BY EU CITIZENS TO BE ASSESSED THOROUGHLY RATHER THAN BEING ROUTINELY DISMISSED AS `MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED'.
752	THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (CREATED IN 1995) IS AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODY COMPRISING THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S COUNTRIES. THE ORGANIZATION'S PURPOSE IS TO PROMOTE MULTILATERAL TRADE THROUGH REDUCTION IN OBSTACLES ERECTED BY INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO GLOBAL TRADE IN GOODS AND SERVICES. SETTLE TRADE DISPUTES, AND LAY DOWN RULES GOVERNING INTERNATIONAL TRADE. WTO ACTIONS ARE TO BE TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF NONDISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL TREATMENT, IN THE SPIRIT OF CLASSICAL LIBERALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW. DECISIONS ARE NORMALLY ARRIVED AT THROUGH THE CONSENSUS OF ALL MEMBERS. CHINA HAS EXPRESSED AN INTENTION TO JOIN THE WTO PRINCIPALLY MANY HOLD. AS A WAY OF BUTTRESSING ITS DOMESTIC MARKET REFORMS AGAINST OPPOSITION FROM SECTIONAL AND IDEOLOGICAL FORCES WITHIN THE PRC WITH VESTED INTERESTS IN THE STATUS QUO. IN THE UNITED STATES. OPPOSITION TO CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WTO COMES FROM VARIED QUARTERS AND HINGES ON THREE CONCERNS: THAT CHINA IS A BIG, COMMUNIST, AND ERRATIC STATE, AND HENCE IS BOTH UNRELIABLE AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE TO THE ORGANIZATION. DESPITE SUCH RISKS AND TAKING DUE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST WHAT ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE WTO. THE ALTERNATIVE OF LEAVING CHINA OUT IS UNTENABLE.
753	STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS HAVE BEEN A KEY ELEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BOTH IN AUSTRALIA AND OVERSEAS, WITH PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, ASSOCIATION, WORK, RECREATION AND PRIVACY. THE RATIONALE FOR ORDERS IS THE MINIMISATION OF THE SPREAD OF DISEASE BETWEEN UNRELATED HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER, FOR MAXIMUM INTENDED EFFECT, PEOPLE NEED TO LIVE IN RESIDENTIAL PREMISES THAT CONTAIN A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD, SUCH AS A FREESTANDING HOUSE OR TERRACE. IN REALITY, WELL OVER TWO MILLION AUSTRALIANS LIVE IN MULTI-HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTIAL PREMISES, TYPICALLY STRATA TITLE SCHEMES. WHEN CONFINED TO THEIR HOMES, THESE PEOPLE WILL OF NECESSITY HAVE CONTACT WITH OTHER HOUSEHOLDS THROUGH THEIR USE OF COLLECTIVELY ACCESSIBLE, PRIVATE COMMON PROPERTY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE WAY IN WHICH NSW PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS RELIED ON CATEGORIES OF LAND TO TRIGGER THEIR OPERATION, BUT FAILED TO PROPERLY ACCOUNT FOR PHYSICAL AND LEGAL DIFFERENCES IN LAND AND BUILDINGS. THE RESULT WAS NONSENSICAL, POTENTIALLY INEFFECTIVE AND - EVENTUALLY - DRACONIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS, OFFENDING THE RULE OF LAW. GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH LOCKDOWNS, AND THE SEVERITY OF THEIR IMPACT ON ORDINARY FREEDOMS, LESSONS MUST BE LEARNT FROM THE PAST TO PROTECT THE HEALTH, SOCIAL WELLBEING AND BASIC RIGHTS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING.
754	RESEARCH IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICAL-ECONOMIC TRADITION CONSIDERS WHAT HISTORICAL, COLONIAL, AND NEOLIBERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNEQUAL EXCHANGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES, POLLUTION, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, THOUGH LESS RESEARCH CONSIDERS INTERNAL IMPACTS OF THE STATE ON CO2 EMISSIONS. THIS IS SURPRISING AS PREVIOUS THEORY AND CASE STUDY WORK SUGGEST THAT THE RELATIVE STRENGTH, POWER, AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITIES OF THE STATE CAN HELP REDUCE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF TRADE. THUS, IN THIS RESEARCH, WE QUESTION IF HIGH LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE WITHIN A NATION HELP REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS FROM TRADE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TEST HOW TRADE AS A PERCENT OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) AND SEVERAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS) ON CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA USING TWO-WAY FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION WITH ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS BY COUNTRY FOR 136 NATIONS, 1995-2013. TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT GOVERNANCE REDUCES THE DETRIMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF TRADE ON CO2 EMISSIONS, WE INCLUDE INTERACTION TERMS BETWEEN EACH GOVERNANCE MEASURE AND TRADE IN OUR MODELS. GENERALLY, WE FIND THAT INTERNAL STATE FACTORS CAN MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE ON CO2 EMISSIONS, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH GIVEN OUR GLOBAL NECESSITY FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND OVERCOMING CLIMATE CHANGE.
755	CHINA'S CLIMATE GOVERNANCE IS DISTINGUISHED BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN AN ABUNDANCE OF POLICIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE LACK OF LEGALLY BINDING LAWS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINESE COURTS BRIDGE THIS DIFFERENCE, WHICH FOSTERS A 'RULE OF CLIMATE POLICY' RATHER THAN A STRICT RULE OF LAW. THE EFFECTIVE AUTHORITY OF CHINESE CLIMATE POLICY IS MADE POSSIBLE IN PRACTICE BOTH BY PROVISIONS OF THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION AND THE PREVAILING USE OF LEGAL REASONING. CHINA'S CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF 'ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION' DELEGATES THE DUTY AND THE POWER OF MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF ITS GOVERNMENT. MOST CHINESE DOCUMENTS ON CLIMATE GOVERNANCE HAVE NO BINDING LEGAL FORCE, WHICH MEANS, ACCORDING TO POSITIVE LAW, THAT THEY CANNOT SERVE AS LEGAL GROUNDS FOR JUDICIAL DECISIONS. CHINESE JUDGES, IN DECIDING CLIMATE-RELATED DISPUTES, MUST COMBINE LEGAL PROVISIONS AND NON-BINDING MATERIALS TO ACHIEVE REGULATORY GOALS. THEY USE NON-LEGAL MATERIALS TO SUPPORT STATUTORY OR CONTRACTUAL INTERPRETATIONS AND DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OR LIMITS OF RIGHTS, WHICH ALTERS THE MEANING AND SCOPE OF EXISTING LEGAL TERMS AND PRINCIPLES. THIS RULE OF CLIMATE POLICY IS POSSIBLE IN THE COURTROOM BECAUSE JUDGES JUSTIFY PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS WITH ARGUMENTS OF PRINCIPLE THAT ARE SUBSTANTIATED IN VARIOUS NON-BINDING CLIMATE PLANS.
756	THE RISE OF POPULISM MAKES IT NECESSARY TO STUDY ITS INFLUENCE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THIS CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR THE NEW MEMBERS OF THE EU AND NATO IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHICH HAVE WITNESSED A "DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING" SINCE 2010. THE ANALYSIS OF POLISH FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE BRINGS IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THAT ISSUE. POLISH AUTHORITIES HAVE CRITICALLY ASSESSED THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF POLISH DIPLOMACY SINCE 1989 AND POLISH DIPLOMATS, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE ELITIST AND COSMOPOLITE. POLISH FOREIGN POLICY LOOKS FOR ENEMIES, RATHER THAN FOR PARTNERS - BOTH AT STATE (RUSSIA, GERMANY) AND NON-STATE LEVEL (IMMIGRANT-REFUGEE THREAT). POLISH AUTHORITIES ARE CRITICAL IN PARTICULAR TOWARDS THE EU, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO ACT IN FAVOUR OF GERMANY AND FRANCE AND AGAINST POLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY. A GROWING ISOLATION OF POLAND IS TO BE COUNTERBALANCED BY A RELIANCE ON POLITICALLY IRRELEVANT (HUNGARY) OR DISTANTLY REMOTE PARTNERS (UNITED STATES UNDER DONALD TRUMP). THE FOREIGN POLICY OF LAW AND JUSTICE IS LARGELY INEFFECTIVE: RELATIONS WITH MOST EUROPEAN PARTNERS HAVE DETERIORATED, BECAUSE OF ITS ISOLATION AND DETERIORATION OF DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS POLAND HAS BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO RUSSIAN PRESSURE AND FINALLY SINCE THE ELECTORAL VICTORY OF JOE BIDEN, POLAND CANNOT COUNT ANY MORE ON THE SUPPORT OF THE US.
757	THE PRACTICE OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MISSIONS AND THEIR MECHANISMS FOR THE CREATION AND DEPLOYMENT SHOW THAT THE EU BEHAVES AS A REGIONAL ORGANISATION THAT ACTS AUTONOMOUSLY IN PEACEKEEPING, UNDER THE PARAMETERS OF CHAPTER VIII OF THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMON SECURITY DEFENCE POLICY (CSDP). IN 2003, THE FORMALIZATION OF THIS COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAS BEEN INITIATED AND INTER-AGENCY MECHANISMS WERE ESTABLISHED. SINCE 2013, THE EU HAS DESIGNED A NUMBER OF ACTION PLANS THAT REFLECT ITS WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS. ITS PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS ARE INSTRUMENTS OF FLEXIBLE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. PRIORITY FOCUS OF INTERVENTION AND COOPERATION INCLUDE SECURITY AND DEFENCE SECTOR REFORM, THE RULE OF LAW, ADVICE AND TRAINING, OR SUPPORT FOR PEACE IN AFRICA. IN ITS INTERVENTION, THE EU HAS NOT IN ALL CASES HAD THE PRIOR AUTHORISATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL (UNSC). CIVILIAN MISSIONS (PEACEKEEPING) HAVE BEEN CREATED AND DEPLOYED WITHOUT THIS AUTHORIZATION, ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL THE UNSC HAS SUBSEQUENTLY VALIDATED THEM WITH ITS RESOLUTIONS ON THE CONFLICT. BY CONTRAST, MOST MILITARY OPERATIONS (PEACE ENFORCEMENT) HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE UNSC, PROVING THE UNION'S WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN OPERATIONS WITH CONCRETED AND TIME-LIMITED MANDATES.
758	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF ISLAMIC AND COMMERCIAL BANKS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AMONG THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) COUNTRIES DURING 2001-2009 (BEFORE AND DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS) AND 2010-2017 (AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS USE A CROSS-SECTIONALLY CORRELATED AND TIMEWISE AUTOREGRESSIVE (CCTA) MODEL. THE AUTHORS ALSO EXTEND THE THEORETICAL ENDOGENOUS GROWTH MODEL DEVELOPED BY PAGANO (1993) BY INTRODUCING THE DEVELOPMENTS IN ISLAMIC AND COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FIND THAT ISLAMIC BANKS FUELED ECONOMIC GROWTH MORE THAN CONVENTIONAL BANKS BEFORE AND AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT FINANCE IS A MAJOR DETERMINANT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT FINANCE DOES NOT FOLLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF ISLAMIC FINANCE CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE AUTHORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE FIRST BY EXAMINING FEEDBACK CAUSALITY AND COINTEGRATION BETWEEN THE BANKING SECTOR AND ECONOMIC GROWTH BY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE BANKING SECTOR AND RULE OF LAW ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE GCC COUNTRIES INSTEAD OF A SINGLE COUNTRY, SECOND BY PROVIDING BOTH OF THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND THIRD BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ISLAMIC AND CONVENTIONAL BANKS.
759	SOUTH KOREA IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CASES IN HISTORY. THIS COUNTRY, STRICKEN WITH CRUSHING POVERTY AND TORN BY A DISASTROUS WAR TWO GENERATIONS AGO, ROSE FROM THE ASHES OF THE WAR AND UNDERWENT UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR OVER THREE DECADES. BY THE MID-1990S, SOUTH KOREA HAD BUILT AN ADVANCED ECONOMY WITH WORLD-CLASS INDUSTRIES AND ALSO ACHIEVED A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE ITS 1997 FINANCIAL CRISIS, HOWEVER, KOREA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY SLOWING DOWN WITH WIDENING INCOME GAPS AMONG ITS POPULATIONS. THE KOREAN ECONOMY HAS ALSO FACED INCREASING EXTERNAL PRESSURE, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN DRAMATIZED BY JAPAN'S EXPORT RESTRAINT MEASURES ON SOME OF THE KEY MATERIALS USED TO PRODUCE SEMICONDUCTORS, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPORT PRODUCTS FOR THE KOREAN ECONOMY. THIS NOTE DISCUSSES STRUCTURAL ISSUES IN THE KOREAN ECONOMY, SUCH AS ITS OVER-DEPENDENCY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CONGLOMERATES ("CHAEBOLS") AND THE WEAKNESS OF ITS SMES, WHICH CAUSE THE KOREAN ECONOMY TO SLOW DOWN AND RENDER THE ECONOMY VULNERABLE TO EXTERNAL PRESSURE. THIS NOTE EXAMINES THESE ISSUES FROM A LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND OFFERS PROPOSALS TO REMEDY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE KOREAN ECONOMY.
760	BASED ON A CONTINUOUS AND RELATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF STATE-FORMATION, AS CONCEPTUALIZED BY CHARLES TILLY, AND INSPIRED BY GRAMSCI'S FORMULATION OF 'WAR OF POSITION', AKP REGIME IN TURKEY CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS A PROCESS OF (RE)-ENTRENCHMENT. THE AKP'S ORIGINAL CLAIM TO DE-SECURITIZE THE STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONSHIP IN TURKEY HAS RE-ENTRENCHED, RE-ALIGNED AND RE-INSTITUTIONALIZED POSITIONS OF POWER AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION WITHIN THE STATE TO OVERCOME THE OLD-GUARD AND ESTABLISH ITS OWN HEGEMONIC RULE. THE CONSPICUOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A BOOKLET FROM 2013, I.E. THE SILENT REVOLUTION, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION OF THE AKP'S AMBITIOUS ORIGINAL CLAIMS FROM ALL AKP-RELATED MEDIA EFFECTIVELY INDICATES ITS ABANDONMENT OF THESE GOALS. THIS DOCUMENT REVEALS THE CONTENTIOUS (RE)ENTRENCHMENTS WHILE THE PARTY ASCENDED TO POWER CHALLENGING DEEP-ROOTED SECURITY-ORIENTED POSITIONS OF THE STATIST NATIONALISM. THIS ASCENT TO POWER WAS INDEED A 'WAR OF POSITION' DURING WHICH INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE EU WERE EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATED AND LEGISLATION AND EXECUTIVE ACTIONS A) PERTAINING RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY, B) ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS REGARDING VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS, ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES AND LABOUR RELATIONS, C) DE-SECURITIZATION AND CIVILIANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND D) ISSUES OF KURDISH CITIZENS WERE UTILIZED AS 'TRENCHES.'
761	BESIDES ITS MULTIPLE HARMS, CORRUPTION UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND IMPEDES THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS. IT INVOLVES BOTH ELITES IN BENDING RULES AND LAWS AS WELL AS POLICE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HIERARCHY ASKING FOR BRIBES. WE ANALYZE CORRUPTION INTENTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF BRENNAN AND PETTIT'S "ECONOMY OF ESTEEM," USING THREE MAIN CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS: ATTACHMENT TO KINSHIP GROUPS, MATERIALISTIC ORIENTATIONS, AND DETERRENCE. WE DRAW ON DATA FROM A SURVEY OF 530 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN GHANA TO EXAMINE PREDICTORS OF CORRUPTION INTENTIONS OF PROSPECTIVE ELITES. OUR PROSPECTIVE ELITES WERE MORE INCLINED TO RESORT TO INFLUENCE PEDDLING RATHER THAN TO PAY BRIBES DIRECTLY. WE FIND THAT ATTITUDINAL PATTERNS INDICATIVE OF ESTEEM PREDICT INTENTIONS TO ENGAGE IN CORRUPT EXCHANGES ACROSS DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND CONTEXTS-POLICE, PROCUREMENT FOR GOVERNMENT, AND ABUSE OF POWER-AS WELL AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTION, WHETHER BRIBE PAYMENT OR NEPOTISM. IN CONTRAST, CITIZENLY PRIDE (AND SELF-ESTEEM) MOTIVATES INTEGRITY ACROSS ALL TYPES OF CORRUPT EXCHANGE. DETERRENCE, IN TERMS OF CERTAINTY, HAD A MORE CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INTENTIONS TO ENGAGE IN NEPOTISM THAN IN BRIBE PAYING AND ACCEPTANCE, WITH PUBLIC PROCUREMENT BEING THE EXCEPTION; NO EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR STIGMA, AND ONLY POLICE NEPOTISM WAS AN EXCEPTION TO THE OTHERWISE NON-SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SEVERITY.
762	INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW HAVE A RELEVANT ROLE NOT ONLY IN THE PROVISION OF GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS, BUT ALSO IN THEIR MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. COMMUNITY INTERESTS ARE RELATED TO GPG, AS THEY TEND TO TRANSCEND STATES' INDIVIDUALS' INTERESTS AND ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE CONSIDERED THE MOST PROMINENT AMONG OTHER EXPRESSIONS OF COMMUNITY INTEREST. AS A COMPONENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS (ICTS) CAN BE CONSIDERED A KEY ELEMENT TO THE PROMOTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF GPG. AS THE PRINCIPAL JUDICIAL ORGAN OF THE UN, THE ICJ IS ABLE TO PROMOTE GPG BY ADJUDICATING INTER-STATE CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE COURT'S INTRINSIC TENSION BETWEEN STATE CONSENT AND GLOBAL VALUES MAY UNDERMINE ITS CAPACITY TO PROMOTE PUBLIC INTEREST. ONE MAY WONDER WHETHER PROCEDURAL LAW COULD BE USED AS AN OBSTACLE FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE PROTECTION OF GPG. BACKLASHES INCLUDE SITUATIONS WHERE INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION PRIORITISES PROCEDURES TO THE DETRIMENT OF COMMUNITY INTERESTS. PROCEDURAL REFORMS IN CASES INVOLVING GPG HAVE BEEN ADVANCED, IN PARTICULAR OF THE RULES REGARDING FACT-FINDING AND EVIDENCE. THEY AIM AT ENSURING THE NORMATIVE AND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMATION OF ICTS, AND IN PARTICULAR OF THE ICJ.
763	AS HONG KONG CELEBRATED ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF BECOMING A SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION OF CHINA TINDER THE ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS MODEL, THE TENSION BETWEEN THE SOCIALIST/CIVIL LAW SYSTEM AND THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE BORDER HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY STRENUOUS. THE TENSION IS MOST OBVIOUS IN RELATION TO THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND IS AGGRAVATED BY THE RISING ECONOMIC POWER OF CHINA AND THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED "LOCALISM" IN HONG KONG. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE LATEST INTERPRETATION OF THE BASIC LAW BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IN THE CONTEXT OF DISQUALIFYING A NUMBER OF POPULARLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS CONSTITUTES THE MOST BLATANT INTERFERENCE WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN HONG KONG TO DATE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE JUDICIARY IN HONG KONG IS FACING MOUNTING CHALLENGES FROM DEMONSTRATORS WHO HAVE TRIED TO TEST THE BOUNDARY OF PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE PRETEXT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. THE COURT HAS DONE WELL SO FAR IN DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IT HAS TO SECURE ITS OWN INSTITUTIONAL SPACE WITHIN A SHRINKING PUBLIC SPACE, AND IS TREADING AN EVER-SLIPPERY PATH OF MAINTAINING THE LIBERAL VALUES OF COMMON LAW SYSTEM AMIDST A RISING ANDPOWERFTI I AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.
764	THE LAST DECADE HAS WITNESSED A SERIES OF CRITICISMS FROM STATES, NGOS, AND SCHOLARS OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW'S RULES AND PROCEDURES. RUNNING IN PARALLEL, AND FOR A LONGER PERIOD, POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEVELOPED THEORIES ABOUT WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A JUST INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER. YET INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PHILOSOPHY HAVE NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED WITH ONE ANOTHER REGARDING THE JUSTICE OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO BREACH THAT GAP BY ANALYZING THE KEY CRITIQUES OF INVESTMENT LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THEORIES OF GLOBAL JUSTICE. PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES ARE USEFUL FOR APPRAISING INVESTMENT LAW BECAUSE THEY OFFER A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT WHERE INVESTMENT LAW SHOULD BE GOING; BECAUSE RULES THAT ALIGN WITH OUR SENSE OF JUSTICE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RESPECTED; AND BECAUSE THESE INQUIRIES FORCE LAWYERS TO BE MORE HONEST ABOUT THE MORAL ASSUMPTIONS THEY ALREADY MAKE IN DEFENDING OR ATTACKING INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. TWO OF THE MAIN CRITIQUES OF INVESTMENT LAW-A SYSTEMIC CRITIQUE AND A POLICY-SPACE CRITIQUE-ARE ANALYZED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. A THIRD, INSTITUTIONAL, CRITIQUE IS EXAMINED FROM PERSPECTIVES WITHIN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY CONCERNING PROCEDURAL JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PIECE CONCLUDES WITH A SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS FOR INTEGRATING THE LEGAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING INVESTMENT LAW.
765	GROWING REPORTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF FRAUDS IN MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS), AS IT CAN OCCUR IN ANY ORGANIZATION IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE ARE WEAK INSTITUTIONS, WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR OF MFI OFFICERS FOR PERSONAL GAIN. WHILE THERE ARE INCREASING CALLS TO LAUNCH FINANCIAL GOVERNANCE OF THESE NGO MFIS, THERE ARE CONCERNS AS TO WHETHER FRAUDS OF THIS NATURE CAN DAMAGE MFIS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CREDIT MARKET, PARTICULARLY IN THE BANK-LINKAGE PROGRAM WHERE THE NGO MFIS ACT AS THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE COLLUSION DECISIONS FACED BY MFIS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE BANK-LINKAGE PROGRAM, WHICH HAS BEEN OFFERED AS A SOLUTION TO HELP OVERCOME ADVERSE SELECTION AND MORAL HAZARD PROBLEMS IN THE CREDIT MARKET BY HARNESSING LOCAL INFORMATION VIA MFIS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT EVEN WHEN THERE IS A CHANCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN MFI AND THE BORROWER, THE LINKAGE BETWEEN MFI AND BANK CAN STILL INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT THE BORROWER PUTS IN FULL EFFORT, AND THEREFORE DECREASES THE PROBABILITIES OF BOTH CREDIT RATIONING AND STRATEGIC DEFAULT. SUCH LINKAGE IN FINANCING VIABLE PROJECTS CAN MAKE MICRO-FINANCING MORE EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING INCLUSIVE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THEREBY POVERTY REDUCTION IN RURAL AREAS.
766	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE IDEA OF A LEGAL RIGHT TO CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS FROM A BASIC LEGAL ETHICAL STANDPOINT, USING REFUSAL TO PERFORM TASKS RELATED TO LEGAL ABORTION (IN CASES OF VOLUNTARY EMPLOYMENT) AS A CASE IN POINT. THE IDEA OF A LEGAL RIGHT TO CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL IS DISTINGUISHED FROM IDEAS REGARDING MORAL RIGHTS OR REASONS RELATED TO CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL, AND NONE OF THE LATTER ARE FOUND TO SUPPORT THE NOTION OF A LEGAL RIGHT. REASONS FOR ALLOWING SOME SORT OF ROOM FOR CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS BASED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL IDENTITY AND THE FOSTERING OF A CRITICAL ATMOSPHERE MIGHT PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT, IF NO COUNTERVAILING FACTORS APPLY. ONE SUCH FACTOR IS THAT A LEGAL RIGHT TO HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL MUST COMPLY WITH BASIC LEGAL ETHICAL TENETS REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW AND EQUAL TREATMENT, AND THIS REQUIREMENT IS FOUND TO CREATE SERIOUS PROBLEMS FOR THOSE WISHING TO DEFEND THE IDEA UNDER CONSIDERATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE NOTION OF A LEGAL RIGHT TO CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL FOR ANY PROFESSION IS EITHER FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH ELEMENTARY LEGAL ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS, OR IMPLAUSIBLE BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE FUNCTIONING OF A RELATED PROFESSIONAL SECTOR ( HEALTHCARE) OR EVEN OF SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
767	THE CONSOLIDATION OF LABOR LAWS (CLT) FIXED THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION FOR PROPOSITION AND PROSECUTION OF LABOR ACTIONS, CONSIDERING, IN GENERAL, THE LAST PLACE OF SERVICE, WHICH IS PROVIDED IN THE ART. 651 OF THE LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENT. THIS PAPER AIMED AT REVEALING THE BASIS OF KLAUS GUNTHER'S ARGUMENT THEORY, AT WHICH THE VALID POSITIVE RULE (JUSTIFICATION OF SPEECH) WOULD BE PASSIVE OF NOT APPLICATION (APPLICATION OF SPEECH). IN THIS SENSE, THE DISSERTATION PROMOTED ARGUMENTS THAT WOULD WARRANT THE PROPOSAL OF A LABOR COMPLAINT ON WHERE THE WORKER'S INTERESTS WERE FAVORED, EVEN ADMITTING AS COMPETENT COURT THE ONE OF THE PERSON'S DOMICILE OR OTHER THAT IS UNDERSTOOD TO BE THE BEST FOR THE DEFENSE OF THEIR QUESTIONS. THE REFLECTION THAT WAS BROUGHT WAS MARKED BY A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE POSITIVE STANDARD AND WORKER PROTECTION PRINCIPLES, FREE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, REASONABLENESS AND PROPORTIONALITY. AS THE APPLICATION OF SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL RULES OF WORK SHOULD ALSO PROTECT THE DISADVANTAGED IT CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED, IN THE MATTER OF THE OWN INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE PROCESS, TO CONSIDER ESTABLISHING A GENERAL RULE THAT NO MORE MOVES IN HARMONY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. IT WAS ADOPTED THE INDUCTIVE-DEDUCTIVE METHOD, FUNCTIONALIST DIALECTIC, SUITABLE FOR RESEARCH OF LEGAL SCIENCE.
768	VIOLENCE AND DEMOCRACY ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS ANTITHETICAL. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR THE CONCEPT OF VIOLENT DEMOCRACY USING THE SOUTH AFRICAN CASE TO EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH VIOLENCE AND DEMOCRACY MAY BE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE IN COUNTRIES OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH, WITH THEIR PARTICULAR HISTORIES OF VIOLENCE, POWER, INEQUALITY AND CONTESTATION. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON RESEARCH INTO INTRA-ELITE CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE, AS WELL AS SUBALTERN COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE, TO DEMONSTRATE THE WAYS IN WHICH DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS GENERATE AND SHAPE VIOLENT PRACTICES, WHILE VIOLENCE IN TURN LIMITS THE ACCESS AND RIGHTS PROMISED BY DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES VIOLENCE AND ELECTIONS, VIOLENCE WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS, POLITICAL ASSASSINATION, AND THE SUBVERSION OF THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW TO SHOW HOW DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS GENERATE AND SHAPE VIOLENCE, AND VIOLENCE IN TURN RESTRICTS AND UNDERMINES THE WORKINGS OF DEMOCRACY - WHICH AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDES MECHANISMS FOR CONSTRAINING AND CHALLENGING VIOLENCE. IT ARGUES THAT THIS KIND OF VIOLENT DEMOCRACY EMERGES WITHIN A GLARINGLY UNEQUAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC ORDER, AND THAT VIOLENCE PROVIDES ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF POWER THROUGH WHICH THIS ORDER MAY BE PRESERVED OR CONTESTED. THE ANALYSIS OF VIOLENT DEMOCRACY MAY REINVIGORATE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY NOT ONLY IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, BUT ALSO IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE GLOBAL NORTH.
769	GOVERNANCE OF A COUNTRY MAY HAVE WIDESPREAD EFFECTS ON THE HEALTH OF ITS POPULATION, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON CHILD MORTALITY IN A COUNTRY THAT IS UNDERGOING URBANIZATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND DISEASE CONTROL. WE OBTAINED INDICATORS OF SIX DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE (PERCEPTIONS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AND NATIONAL UNDER-5 MORTALITY RATES FOR 149 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2010. WE APPLIED A SEMI-PARAMETRIC GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MIXED MODEL TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT FACTORS (URBANIZATION LEVEL AND ECONOMY), DISEASE CONTROL FACTORS (HYGIENIC CONDITIONS AND VACCINATION RATES), HEALTH EXPENDITURES, AIR QUALITY, AND TIME. GOVERNANCE, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISEASE CONTROL SHOWED CLEAR INVERSE RELATIONS WITH THE UNDER-5 MORTALITY RATE (P < 0.001). PER UNIT INCREASES IN GOVERNANCE, DEVELOPMENT, AND DISEASE CONTROL FACTORS, THE CHILD MORTALITY RATE HAD A 0.901-, 0.823-, AND 0.922-FOLD DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY, AT FIXED LEVELS OF THE OTHER TWO FACTORS. IN THE EFFORT TO REDUCE THE GLOBAL UNDER-5 MORTALITY RATE, ADDRESSING A COUNTRY'S NEED FOR BETTER GOVERNANCE IS AS IMPORTANT AS IMPROVEMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE CONTROL.
770	VISA OFFICERS ARE ONE OF THE GATEKEEPERS OF A STATE'S BORDERS. RESEARCH ON DISCRETION EXERCISED BY IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS TENDS TO FOCUS ON INTERDICTION OR THE REGULATION OF PORTS OF ENTRY. THOUGH ALL BORDER CONTROL AGENTS ARE DELEGATED WITH DISCRETION, DECISIONS ABOUT VISA ISSUANCE ARE ARGUABLY MORE TIGHTLY BOUND BY THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH OVERSEAS VISA OFFICERS WHO WORK FOR CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION CANADA, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE SOCIAL CONSTITUTION OF DISCRETION IN FAMILY CLASS SPOUSAL AND SPONSORSHIP CASES. DEBATES IN CANADA SUGGEST THAT THE PERSONAL ATTITUDES OF VISA OFFICERS ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN SHAPING THEIR EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. MOREOVER, DISCRETION IS SEEN AS A REFLECTION OF RACISM OF INDIVIDUAL VISA OFFICERS. THIS PAPER CHALLENGES THIS VIEW BY SUGGESTING THAT BROADER MESO-AND MACRO-LEVEL FORCES PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN DISCRETIONARY DECISION-MAKING. IT EXAMINES HOW THE DEMANDS OF EFFICIENT CLIENT PROCESSING, CLIENT BEHAVIOUR, MIGRATION CONTEXTS AND LEGAL CONSTRAINTS IN CANADA AND OVERSEAS SHAPE THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING. DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS TO DIG DEEPER INTO SOME APPLICATIONS AND NOT OTHERS DO PUT APPLICANTS FROM SOME COUNTRIES OR REGIONS AT A DISADVANTAGE, BUT IT IS A TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATIVE LOGIC, AND NOT 'RACE' THAT IS THE SOURCE OF DISCRIMINATION.
771	THE INCREASING CRIMINALISATION OF IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES HAS THE EFFECT OF SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE STATE TO THE INDIVIDUAL MIGRANT FOR ALLEGED "CRIMINAL" BEHAVIOUR. THIS SHIFT REPRESENTS A FORM OF DISCIPLINARY POWER AS IT IS ENACTED OVER "DEVIANT" POPULATIONS WHO ARE UNABLE TO SELF-GOVERN ACCORDING TO THE TENETS REQUIRED IN A SYSTEM OF GLOBAL GOVERNMENTALITY. IN THIS ARTICLE, I USE FOUCAULT'S GOVERNMENTALITY TO EXAMINE THE "RESPONSIBILISATION" OF UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS WHO ARE PERCEIVED AS MAKING A RATIONAL CHOICE TO CROSS THE BORDER. I ARGUE THAT THE CRIMINALISATION OF IMMIGRATION SHIFTS THE EMPHASIS TO INDIVIDUALS AS RATIONAL ACTORS WHO HAVE REJECTED PATHS TO LEGAL IMMIGRATION, CHOOSING "ILLEGAL" IMMIGRATION, WHICH CARRIES THE CONNOTATION OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR. THIS CONSTRUCTS A POPULATION OF ALWAYS ALREADY CRIMINAL SUBJECTS WHO ARE UNDERSTOOD TO DISREGARD THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS RESEARCH I CARRY OUT A CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS THAT LOOKS AT THE PERFORMATIVE CONCEPTUALISATION OF "ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS" AND THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING OF MIGRANTS AS CRIMINALS. I LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE OF MEXICO-US BORDER CROSSINGS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SYSTEM OF GLOBAL GOVERNMENTALITY AND I POSIT THAT INTERNATIONAL UNDOCUMENTED MIGRATION IS CRIMINALISED AND MIGRANTS ARE "RESPONSIBILISED", WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES, CONTRIBUTING TO A GEOPOLITICAL DISCOURSE THAT REPRESENTS POPULATION MANAGEMENT AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL.
772	PARTIES CAN BE A CRUCIAL TO DEMOCRATIC FUNCTION BUT NOT ALL PARTIES OR PARTY SYSTEMS ARE DEMOCRATIC. SOME PARTIES ARE FULLY COMPETITIVE WITHIN A PLURALIST SYSTEM WHILE OTHERS, NOTABLY HEGEMONIC PARTIES, ARE ANTITHETICAL TO DEMOCRACY. BETWEEN COMPETITIVE, PLURALIST PARTY SYSTEMS AND HEGEMONIC PARTY SYSTEMS LIE PREDOMINANT PARTY SYSTEMS. THESE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH DEMOCRACY WHERE DEMOCRACY IS FULLY CONSOLIDATED BUT INHIBIT DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN SETTINGS WITH AN AUTHORITARIAN HISTORY OR WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS INCOMPLETE. THE EFFECT OF PREDOMINANT PARTIES IN UNCONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES HAS NOT BEEN FULLY STUDIED IN COMPARATIVE CONTEXT. I SCRUTINIZE THIS PROBLEM IN ARGENTINA, WHICH HAS FOLLOWED AN ELECTORAL CALENDAR FOR TWO DECADES, BUT LACKS A FULLY PLURALIST SYSTEM OF POWER-SHARING AMONG TWO NATIONALLY-COMPETITIVE PARTIES. THE AUTHORITARIAN BACKGROUND OF PERONISM, OF ARGENTINA ITSELF AND THE LIMITED COMPETITIVE POTENTIAL OF THE RADICAL PARTY HAVE CURTAILED DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE UNDERSCORES THE SERIOUSNESS OF ARGENTINA'S DILEMMA BY CONTRASTING ITS SITUATION WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY PREDOMINANCE IN THE UNITED STATES DEEP SOUTH IN THE 1940S. THE COMPARISON OF DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT IN AN OLDER DEMOCRACY WITH THAT OF A NEWER DEMOCRACY ILLUSTRATES THAT SOME OF THE PROCESSES OF CONSOLIDATION ARE SIMILAR AND THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF OLDER DEMOCRACIES MAY INDICATE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS FOR NEWER DEMOCRACIES.
773	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A BRIEF REVIEW OF REPRESSION AND CONFLICT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) OVER THE LAST CENTURY, BEFORE ANALYSING THE TRANSITION PROCESS AND THE COUNTRY'S PROSPECTS FOR CONSOLIDATING A DEMOCRACY IN THE FUTURE. THE DRC PEACEKEEPING PROCESS HAS BEEN THE UNITED NATION'S MOST EXPENSIVE PROJECT TO DATE WITH AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF OVER USD 1 BILLION PER ANNUM. THE JULY ELECTIONS WERE LARGELY PEACEFULLY CONDUCTED AND REFLECTED A HIGH LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION. BUILDING A STABLE SUSTAINABLE DEMOCRACY, HOWEVER, WILL BE DIFFICULT. THE DRC MUST SURVIVE ITS POVERTY, LACK OF STRUCTURE, DEBT, LOW LEVELS OF INVESTMENT, INTERNAL FRAGMENTATION, AND A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND PREDATORY NEIGHBOURS. IT MUST RAPIDLY DEVELOP A STRONG, JUST STATE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY BROADCAST POWER; RESOLVE BOUNDARY ISSUES IN THE FACE OF POTENTIAL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL THREATS; DEVELOP A COMMON SENSE OF NATIONHOOD AND IDENTITY AMONGST ITS CITIZENS ALONG WITH A CULTURE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM (RULE OF LAW); ACQUIRE AND EFFECTIVELY USE AID FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY; DEAL WITH POTENTIALLY PREDATORY NEIGHBOURS; ACHIEVE RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INSTALL EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS ACROSS A BROAD FRONT TO MINIMISE A DRIFT BACK TO VIOLENCE. IT'S A DAUNTING AGENDA WITH LIMITED RESOURCES.
774	PEACE HAS BEEN DEEMED PARAMOUNT TO SOCIOECONOMIC PROGRESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACROSS NATIONS. IT IS FOR THIS REASON NATIONS STRIVE TO IMPROVE THE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF CITIZENS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF DEMOCRACY, GOVERNANCE AND MILITARISATION ON PEACE IN 43 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE YEAR 2018 IN A CROSS SECTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (OLS), THE TOBIT REGRESSION AND THE QUANTILE REGRESSION (QR) WHERE EMPLOYED AS ESTIMATION STRATEGIES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULT FIRSTLY REVEAL THAT DEMOCRACY INCREASES PEACE IN AFRICA, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE INITIAL LEVEL OF PEACE IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL. SECONDLY, MILITARISATION OF AFRICA REDUCES PEACE IN THE REGION ONLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE INITIAL LEVEL OF PEACE IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL. THIRDLY, THE INFLUENCE OF GOVERNANCE ON PEACE IN AFRICA DEPENDS MAJORLY ON THE MEASURE OF GOVERNANCE UTILIZED. THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY INCREASES PEACE WHERE THE INITIAL LEVEL OF PEACE IS AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL. POLITICAL STABILITY INCREASES PEACE ACROSS THE ENTIRE QUANTILES UTILIZED WHILE RULE OF LAW INCREASES PEACE IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE INITIAL LEVEL OF PEACE IS LOW. IN CONCLUSION, GOVERNANCE IN GENERAL INCREASES PEACE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE INITIAL LEVEL OF PEACE IS VERY LOW. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THESE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED.
775	THE JURIDICAL USUALLY REMAINS HOSTAGE TO THE POSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE GUIDED BY THE SUBJECT-OBJECT RELATIONSHIP. THUS, CONSTITUTIONS, AS A WRITTEN TEXT, END UP HAVING LIMITED DEMOCRATIC POTENTIAL. THE CONDITION OF HERMENEUTIC-PHILOSOPHICAL POSSIBILITY OF THE CONSTITUTION IMPOSES EXTRACTION OF MEANINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT, ADDING THE DESIRABLE DEMOCRATIC TO THE LEGAL OUTLINE. THE POWERS OF THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY THE JUDICIARY, HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AWAKENING AND CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC FEELING, ESPECIALLY IN PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES. NOT THAT DEMOCRACY CAN AND SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A DOWNWARD DIRECTION THROUGH THE JUDICIAL ROUTE, GIVEN BY THE JUDICIARY, BUT THAT THE JUDICIARY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISE AND PROTAGONISM OF THE CITIZEN, TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRUE DEMOCRACY, UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL CEILING. THE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE USED CONSISTED OF RESEARCHING AND REVIEWING THE LITERATURE ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THEMES WITH CRITICAL RATIONALITY. THE ARTICLE REINFORCES THE NEED TO OVERCOME SOCIALLY INNOCUOUS POSITIVISM, CONCERNED EXCLUSIVELY WITH OBTAINING INTERPRETATIONS OF LEGAL TEXTS, PROPOSING A PRAGMATISM IN CONSTITUTIONAL FEELING AND THINKING. CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE EFFECTIVE FAVORING OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LAW AND SOCIETY, A WINDOW IS OPENED SO THAT SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION, AIMING AT HUMAN, INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE PROGRESS, IS ALSO POSSIBLE THROUGH LAW.
776	EFFICIENCY AND EQUALITY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT GOALS AND VALUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, AND THEIR CONCURRENCY (BALANCE) HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF HIGHER EDUCATION SCHOLARS AND POLICY MAKERS OVER THE PAST DECADES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO DISCOVER THE CAUSAL MECHANISM AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT ARE LIKELY TO RESULT IN CONCURRENCY OF EQUALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. TO THIS END, THE COMBINATION OF TWO EXPLANATORY THEORIES OF EQUALITY AND EFFICIENCY WERE USED. THE THEORY OF EQUALITY FOCUSED ON THREE DIMENSIONS OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES, MODERNIZATION, AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. LIKEWISE, TO EXPLAIN EFFICIENCY, CHALABI'S THREE-LEVEL CAUSAL MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF SCIENCE WAS USED. METHODOLOGICALLY, A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY METHOD WAS ADOPTED, AND THE CASES UNDER STUDY (NINE COUNTRIES) WERE SELECTED BASED ON PURPOSIVE SAMPLING. THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT FOR THE CONCURRENCY OF EQUALITY AND EFFICIENCY IN HIGHER EDUCATION, A SET OF CONDITIONS MUST BE PRESENT IN THE CONFIGURATIONAL AND COMBINATIONAL CAUSALITY. THE PRECONDITIONS FOR THIS CONCURRENCY IS THE PRESENCE OF SOME SOCIAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY, THE RULE OF LAW, INTER-SOCIETIES COMPETITIVENESS, SOCIAL COHESION, DEMOCRACY, UNIVERSALISM, EGALITARIANISM (AT MACRO LEVEL), MERITOCRACY, ACADEMIC AUTONOMY, AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS (AT THE MESO LEVEL) AND THE ABSENCE OF SOME OTHER CONDITIONS INCLUDING FATALISM (AT THE MACRO LEVEL).
777	WE COMPARE THE PRE- AND POST-2010 HUNGARIAN POLITICAL REGIMES THROUGH THE LENS OF PENSION POLICIES. WE LABEL THE PRE-2010 REGIME AS DEMOCRATIC POPULIST BECAUSE IT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY FISCALLY IRRESPONSIBLE POLICIES, YET IT MAINTAINED THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN CONTRAST, WE CALL THE POST-2010 REGIME AUTHORITARIAN POPULIST AS IT HAS EMPLOYED AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL TECHNIQUES WHILE MAINTAINED POPULAR LEGITIMATION THROUGH REGULAR ELECTIONS. TO SUBSTANTIATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS FROM AN ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT, WE COMPARE PRE- AND POST-2010 PENSION POLICIES TO FIND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS SURPRISING SIMILARITIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE ANALYSED THE FOLLOWING FIVE POLICY ASPECTS: (A) REFORM AND PARTIAL PRIVATIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT-RUN PENSION SYSTEM, (B) POLICIES ON THE STATUTORY (NORMAL) AND THE EFFECTIVE (AVERAGE) PENSION AGE, (C) INDEXATION, (D) PROGRESSION IN BENEFITS CALCULATIONS AND PROGRESSIVITY IN THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX, AND (E) CONTRIBUTION RATES. BASED ON IDEOLOGICAL PREFERENCES, WE ARGUE THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT THE PENSION SYSTEM TO BECOME FINANCIALLY MORE SUSTAINABLE BUT LESS REDISTRIBUTIVE AFTER 2010 IN COMPARISON TO THE PRECEDING PERIOD. YET, WE FIND THAT ALTHOUGH PRO-POOR REDISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE PENSION SYSTEM HAS INDEED BEEN CURTAILED, FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY HAS NOT IMPROVED DUE TO THE ERRATIC POLICIES.
778	THE WORK OF PARLIAMENT AND OMBUDSMAN IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. STILL, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS IS CONSIDERABLY UNDER-RESEARCHED. THIS PAPER AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO FILLING THIS RESEARCH GAP BY PRESENTING A SET OF KEY CRITERIA FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THESE ARE APPLIED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE SERBIAN PARLIAMENT'S ACTIONS TOWARDS THE OMBUDSMAN IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF OPERATIONS OF THIS NEW INSTITUTION IN THE SERBIAN LEGAL AND POLITICAL SYSTEM ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL (2007-2016). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PARLIAMENT DID NOT BUILD CONSISTENT, PREDICTABLE AND EFFICIENT RELATIONS WITH THE OMBUDSMAN YET. INSTEAD OF BEING A SUPREME PROTECTOR OF THE OMBUDSMAN'S INDEPENDENCE AND ITS STRONGEST ALLY IN THE PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, PARLIAMENT DEVELOPED A PRACTICE OF HAMPERING THE OMBUDSMAN'S WORK. THE RESULTS MAY SERVE AS AN INDICATOR OF THE STATE OF DEMOCRATISATION OF SERBIA, AS WELL AS FOR ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF THE PARLIAMENT'S INSTITUTIONAL MATURITY. OUTSIDE THE SERBIAN CONTEXT, THIS STUDY CAN BE A USEFUL SOURCE FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE FOR ALL PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMEN, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE ALSO NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS (NHRIS).
779	DESPITE THE REMARKABLE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION TO POPULISM AND POPULIST PARTIES, THE RELATION BETWEEN POPULISM AND RELIGION REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED. USING EVIDENCE FROM TWO LONG-TERM RULING POPULIST PARTIES - TURKEY'S JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY AND MACEDONIA'S INTERNAL MACEDONIAN REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATION-DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR MACEDONIAN NATIONAL UNITY - THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON HOW AND WHY RELIGION CAN BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR POPULIST POLITICS AT THREE LEVELS: (I) DISCURSIVE, (II) PUBLIC POLICY AND (III) INSTITUTIONALISED ALLIANCES WITH RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT RELIGION COMES INTO PLAY AT THESE THREE LEVELS ONCE POPULISTS ATTAIN COMFORTABLE ELECTORAL MARGINS BUT ENCOUNTER MOUNTING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT CAN POTENTIALLY WEAKEN THEIR GRIP ON POWER. RULING POPULISTS CO-OPT AND MONOPOLISE THE MAJORITY RELIGION IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL' AS THEY INCREASINGLY UNDERMINE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY BUT THEY NEED TO JUSTIFY THEIR SYSTEMATIC CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT, THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, THE RULE OF LAW AND MINORITIES. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS OF THE STUDY ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE DUAL FUNCTION OF RELIGION FOR POPULISTS: ITS CATCH-ALL POTENTIAL TO CREATE CROSS-CLASS AND CROSS-ETHNICITY POPULAR SUPPORT, AND ITS INSTRUMENTALITY TO DISCREDIT DISSENT AS RELIGIOUSLY UNFIT' WHILE CONSTRUCTING AN ANTAGONISM OF THE PEOPLE' VERSUS THE ELITES'.
780	WE EXAMINE BETWEEN-COUNTRY VARIATIONS IN OVERALL LEVELS OF EXTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY AND DISPARITIES IN POLITICAL EFFICACY BY PARENTAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS (SES). FURTHERMORE, WE IDENTIFY THE MEDIATING ROLE OF INDIVIDUALS' COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND OWN SES, AS WELL AS HOW CONTEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE COGNITIVE ABILITIES AND INDIVIDUALS' OWN SES HAVE FOR POLITICAL SELF-EFFICACY BELIEFS. WE USE DATA FROM THE 2012 OECD SURVEY OF ADULT SKILLS, A LARGE-SCALE INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT CONTAINING INFORMATION ON RESPONDENTS' SES, COGNITIVE SKILLS, THEIR PARENTS' SES AND THEIR SELF-REPORTED EXTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY IN 28 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. WE FIND THAT EXTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY IS STRONGLY RELATED TO PARENTS' SES AND THAT, ON AVERAGE, AROUND 60% OF THE PARENTAL SES GRADIENT IS MEDIATED BY COGNITIVE ABILITIES (WHICH ACCOUNT FOR AROUND 30% OF THE PARENTAL SES GRADIENT) AND OWN SES (WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE REMAINING 30%). SUCH MEDIATING ROLE DIFFERS ACROSS COUNTRIES. COGNITIVE ABILITIES ARE LESS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY IN COUNTRIES WITH GREATER RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND LOWER PERCEIVED CORRUPTION AND INDIVIDUALS' OWN SES IS LESS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY IN COUNTRIES WITH SINGLE-WINNER VOTING RULES (SUCH AS WINNER-TAKES-ALL OR FIRST-PAST-THE-POST RULES).

781	IN VERFASSUNGSLEHRE, CARL SCHMITT SPELLS OUT THE RADICAL IMPLICATIONS OF HIS OWN ANALYSIS IN DER BEGRIFF DES POLITISCHEN OF THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL. HE ARGUES IN THIS RESPECT THAT THE POLITICAL COMPONENT OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH IS SUPPRESSED BY LIBERAL THINKING THROUGH ITS PRIVILEGE OF THE RULE OF LAW, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THESE CONSTITUTIONS. THE POLITICAL COMPONENT REFERS ESSENTIALLY TO THE FORM OF THE POLITICAL UNITY OF A PEOPLE. IN SHOWING THE PRIORITY OF THE POLITICAL COMPONENT, SCHMITT INTER ALIA INSISTS ON DRAWING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS, THE RESURRECTION OF THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY, UNDERSTANDING EQUALITY AS FIRST OF ALL AND NECESSARILY IMPLYING AN INEQUALITY IN RESPECT OF THOSE WHO ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE POLITICAL UNITY, AND ON THE SUBJECTION OF FREEDOM TO THE POLITICAL COMPONENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT WOULD THE IMPLICATIONS BE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY IF ONE WERE TO TAKE SERIOUSLY DERRIDA'S DECONSTRUCTION OF SCHMITT'S CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL IN POLITIQUES DE L'AMITIE? THIS ESSAY TAKES THE FIRST TENTATIVE STEPS IN THIS DIRECTION, BY EXPLORING IN DETAIL DERRIDA'S ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE NEW STRUCTURE OF THE POLITICAL THAT COMES TO THE FORE IN THIS TEXT.
782	DATA ARE AVAILABLE ON HOMICIDE TRENDS AND PATTERNS FOR 235 COUNTRIES FROM SIX CONTINENTS FROM 1950 TO 2010. RECENT RATES RANGE FROM FEWER THAN 0.5 VICTIM PER 100,000 POPULATION TO 80 AND REGIONALLY FROM AROUND ONE IN SCANDINAVIA TO AROUND 30 IN CENTRAL AMERICA. COUNTRIES THAT SHARE CULTURAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL TRADITIONS USUALLY HAVE SIMILAR CRIME TRENDS. IN WESTERN COUNTRIES, LETHAL VIOLENCE INCREASED IN THE 1960S THROUGH THE EARLY 1990S, FOLLOWED BY DECLINES. ELSEWHERE, TRENDS MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT AS A RESULT OF LOCAL POLITICAL CONFIGURATIONS AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS. IN EASTERN EUROPE, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIME WAS AFFECTED BY POLITICAL TURMOIL AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION AND IN SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES BY UNSTABLE POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE DRUG INDUSTRY. HOMICIDE IS NOT DECREASING IN PARTS OF THE AMERICAS AND THE CARIBBEAN. CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES CONFIRM THE INTERDEPENDENCY OF LETHAL VIOLENCE WITH SOCIOECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS. THE LEVEL OF LETHAL VIOLENCE IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE QUALITY AND INTEGRITY OF GOVERNANCE, THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY. NO SIGNS WERE DETECTED OF THE EFFECTS OF SANCTIONS PRACTICES. USE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, HIGH RATES OF IMPRISONMENT, AND LONG SENTENCES COINCIDE WITH HIGH AND INCREASING HOMICIDE RATES-AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
783	POLITICAL "ATTACKS" ON THE JUDICIARY ARE A WELL-KNOWN THREAT TO CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. CRITICISM OF THE JUDICIARY BY POLITICIANS IS OFTEN SAID TO CONSTITUTE ONE FORM OF ATTACK WHEN IT IS UNFAIR IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE JUDICIARY'S CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE AND/OR NOT RESPECTFUL. UNFAIR CRITICISM IS FREQUENTLY CLAIMED TO BE UNACCEPTABLE ON THE BASIS THAT IT THREATENS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY AND, THEREFORE, THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY INTERROGATES THIS CLAIM, ARGUING THAT UNFAIR CRITICISM CAN HAVE VALUE AS A FORM OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE JUDICIARY. IT CAN HOLD THE JUDICIARY TO ACCOUNT FOR ASPECTS OF ITS DECISION MAKING THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO SCRUTINY AND THAT OTHER ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS, SUCH AS THE APPEALS PROCEDURE AND THE LAWMAKING PROCESS, DO NOT. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS APT TO HOLD THE JUDICIARY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFUSE SOCIETAL EFFECTS, VALUES, AND PRINCIPLES OF ITS DECISION MAKING. AS A RESULT, THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF UNFAIR CRITICISM IS CONTESTABLE AND CONTEXT SPECIFIC BECAUSE IT INVOLVES TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH ITS POTENTIAL VALUE AND ITS POTENTIAL THREAT. THE ARTICLE EVALUATES THE SUBJECT BY DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCES WITH UNFAIR CRITICISM OF THE JUDICIARY BY MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATURE IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.
784	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE SOCIETAL MULTIPLICITY PROPOSITION AS A WELCOME CONCEPTUAL PROPOSITION FOR IR. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE DISCIPLINE'S TRAJECTORY AND ESPECIALLY ADLER'S CALL FOR A TURN TOWARDS 'THE SOCIAL' IN THE 1990S, ROSENBERG'S PROPOSITION OFFERS A NUDGE TOWARDS SCRUTINISING CONCEPTS FOR A MORE CONCISE AND SYSTEMATIC APPRECIATION OF SOCIETAL MULTIPLICITY AS A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION IN A GLOBALISED WORLD. SECOND, THIS IS ILLUSTRATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE FROM BELOW AS THE INTERNATIONAL LIBERAL ORDER STANDS CONTESTED AND ALLIANCES ARE RE-NEGOTIATED. THIRD, IT DEMONSTRATES WHY DURING THIS PERIOD OF GLOBAL CHANGE IT IS KEY TO DIVERSIFY SOURCES OF MEANING-MAKING AND THE CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES TO REFLECT THIS DIVERSIFICATION. AND FOURTH, IT TURNS TO PRACTICES OF CONTESTATION AS DRIVERS OF INTER-SOCIETAL NEGOTIATIONS THAT TARGET BOTH ESTABLISHED FUNDAMENTAL NORMS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE (E.G. THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRACY) AND MORE RECENTLY, NEGOTIATED FUNDAMENTAL NORMS (E.G. CLIMATE JUSTICE, GENDER JUSTICE, OR INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE). THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT A CONCEPTUAL SHIFT FROM THE AGENCY OF STATES AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS CARRIERS OF KNOWLEDGE AND MEDIATORS OF NORMATIVE CHANGE TOWARDS ENGAGING SOCIETAL AGENCY REPRESENTS A WELCOME CONTRIBUTION.
785	THIS ARTICLE FOLLOWS THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE ABOUT RUSSIA'S POST-SOVIET TRANSITION OVER 20 YEARS OF PUTIN'S STAY IN POWER. TO DETECT HOW THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL REGIME TOWARD AUTHORITARIANISM WAS LEGITIMIZED, IT FOCUSES ON COMPARISON OF CONCISE NARRATIVES ARTICULATED IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES TO THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. THE METHOD OF RESEARCH IS COMPUTER-ASSISTED QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. THE ARTICLE REVEALS HOW THE DECLARED STAGES OF MODERN RUSSIA'S DEVELOPMENT CORRELATED WITH THE EVOLVING REPRESENTATIONS OF THE WEST. THE INITIAL GOALS OF ESTABLISHING DEMOCRACY, THE MARKET ECONOMY, AND THE RULE OF LAW OVER TIME WERE EITHER REINTERPRETED OR DISSOLVED INTO MINOR PRACTICAL TASKS. THE MOST OFTEN ARTICULATED POLICY GOAL WAS RAISING THE PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARDS, WHICH WAS NARRATED AS OVERCOMING THE TRAUMA OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND THE HARD 1990S. IN THE ADDRESSES, RUSSIA BECAME REPRESENTED AS A COUNTRY THAT COMPLETED ITS TRANSITION BETWEEN 2012 AND 2018, WITH RESTORING ITS INTERNATIONAL POSITIONS AND MILITARY STRENGTH, AS WELL AS RESOURCES FOR BETTER SOCIAL WELFARE. THE "DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY" WAS DECLARED TO BE INSTITUTED; HOWEVER, THIS TERM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FORMAL ELECTIONS AND FACILITATING CIVIC PARTICIPATION, NOT WITH THE ALTERNATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF POWER.
786	DOES THE POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OF GOVERNMENTS INFLUENCE CREDIT RATINGS? PREVIOUS STUDIES REPORT THAT THE ECONOMIC LEFT-RIGHT DIMENSION HAS AN IMPACT ON CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, RECENT LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RIGHT-WING AND LEFT-WING DEBT-RELATED POLICIES. IN ADDITION, CURRENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS THE RISE OF POPULIST MOVEMENTS, INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMIC LEFT-RIGHT DIMENSION MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DESCRIBE HOW POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AFFECTS GOVERNMENTS' ACTIONS AND THEREBY CREDIT RATINGS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE SOCIO-CULTURAL DIMENSION OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OR THE GAL-TAN (GREEN-ALTERNATIVE-LIBERAL VS. TRADITIONALIST-AUTHORITARIAN-NATIONALIST) ALSO IMPACTS A COUNTRY'S RATING. IN PARTICULAR, THE STUDY PROPOSES THAT TAN-LEANING GOVERNMENTS ARE PERCEIVED AS A RISK FACTOR FOR DEBT REPAYMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO ADHERE TO RULE OF LAW AND ARE RELUCTANT TO COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DOMESTIC POLITICAL PARTIES. THEY ALSO PREFER PROTECTIONIST POLICIES FOR CULTURAL REASONS. USING DATA FROM THE CHAPEL HILL EXPERT SURVEY FOR 24 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1999 AND 2019, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GOVERNMENTS WITH TAN-LEANING MAJOR PARTIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TOWARD A CLOSER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ROLE DAY-TO-DAY POLITICS AND GOVERNMENTS' POLITICAL IDEOLOGY HAVE FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF CREDIT RATINGS.
787	THE PAPER AS A RESEARCH SUBJECT DEALS WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF A NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY TREND IN STUDYING THE LAW - LEGAL THEOLOGY. THE AUTHORS ARGUE IN FAVOUR OF ACKNOWLEDGING THE VALUE OF THE THEOLOGICAL DIMENSION OF LAW AND LEGAL AWARENESS FOR THE CONTEMPORARY POST-SECULAR WORLD. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL VALUE OF LEGAL THEOLOGY FOR INVESTIGATING LEGAL AWARENESS, SHAPING LEGAL CULTURE AND LEGAL THEOLOGY OF THE CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN STATE. AS A RESULT OF THE THEOLOGICAL DIMENSION OF LAW, THE PAPER ALSO FOCUSES ON SPIRITUAL AND MORAL GROUNDS OF LEGAL AWARENESS, WHICH DETERMINE LEGAL VALUES, IDEALS AND BELIEFS OF A PERSONALITY AS WELL AS PRIMARILY IMPACT THE RELATED CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR. FOR THESE PURPOSES, TO INVESTIGATE LEGAL AWARENESS OF A CRIMINAL, THE AUTHORS APPEAL TO ORTHODOX ANTHROPOLOGY BASED UPON PATRISTIC CONCEPTS AND TEACHINGS ON COMBATING EGOCENTRISM AND AGGRESSION, AS WELL AS THE REFLECTION OF PASSIONS WHICH GENERATE, ORIGINATE THE BASIC NEGATIVE MOTIVES OF LEGAL MENTALITY AND LEGAL AWARENESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL. THE LEGAL THEOLOGY ACTUALIZES THE ASCETIC STUDY OF LEGAL AWARENESS AND ENABLES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE POST-SECULAR WORLD TO MOBILIZE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS AND CONCERNS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A STEADY RULE OF LAW.
788	DESPITE THE ENORMOUS INFLOW OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WESTERN BALKANS OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS, THE INTENDED STATE-BUILDING EFFORTS HAVE ONLY HAD PARTIAL SUCCESS AND GREAT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED OVER THE PROBLEMS OF STATE CAPTURE, WEAK GOVERNANCE, POOR RULE OF LAW AND WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION AT A HIGH LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THE PAPER IDENTIFIES THE PATTERNS OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH DONOR AID ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY CONCERNS FOR RECIPIENTS' NEED AND MERIT, OR BY DONOR SELF-INTEREST. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT WHILE DONOR ALLOCATIONS HAVE ON THE WHOLE REFLECTED NEED, THEY HAVE NOT REFLECTED MERIT TO THE SAME EXTENT, SUGGESTING THAT INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE MAY HAVE FACILITATED DOMESTIC POLITICAL ELITES' ENGAGEMENT IN PRACTICES OF RENT-SEEKING AND STATE CAPTURE. WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS, EU DONORS AND EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT ALLOCATED THEIR AID TO MOTIVATE ADHERENCE TO EU NORMS IN CANDIDATE AND POTENTIAL CANDIDATE STATES IN THE REGION. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE 'SAMARITANS DILEMMA' IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE WESTERN BALKANS, AND THAT DONORS HAVE CHOSEN TO MOSTLY OVERLOOK POOR GOVERNANCE BEHAVIOUR AMONG RECIPIENTS IN ORDER TO PRIORITISE ASSISTANCE TO THE NEEDIEST COUNTRIES WHILE PURSUING THEIR OWN FOREIGN POLICY CONCERNS.
789	THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED ACTIVISM. HOWEVER, GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO CURB OPPOSITION HAVE RECENTLY LEARNED TO TARGET THE VERY SAME TECHNOLOGIES THAT EMPOWERED ACTIVISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE ACCEPTED FRAMEWORK FOR DISCUSSING SUCH EFFORTS BY GOVERNMENTS, CENTERED ON SURVEILLANCE AND PRIVACY. IT ARGUES, FIRST, THAT GOVERNMENTS' ACTIONS SHOULD BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS MEASURES OF DIGITAL DOMINATION. APPLYING THE REPUBLICAN CONCEPT OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE CORE HARM RESULTING FROM SUCH DOMINATION IS TO ACTIVISTS' FREEDOM, NOT ONLY TO THEIR PRIVACY. SINCE ACTIVISM IS A CHECK ON THE GOVERNMENT, MEASURES UNDERMINING THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVISM ALSO HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE CITIZENRY AS A WHOLE. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GOVERNMENTS' RELIANCE ON DIGITAL MILITIAS ALLOWS THEM TO SIDESTEP THE LIMITS OF THEIR LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY, THEREFORE POSING A GRAVE THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE UNDERSCORES THAT GOVERNMENTS DEPLOY MEASURES OF CONTROL BEYOND SURVEILLANCE. RATHER, THEY (1) GATHER INFORMATION ON ACTIVISTS, (2) DISRUPT COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, (3) FLOOD ONLINE CONVERSATION TO DROWN OUT THE OPPOSITION, (4) DEPLOY THE STATE'S COERCIVE POWER BASED ON INFORMATION GATHERED, AND (5) MOBILIZE DIGITAL MILITIAS TO BULLY ACTIVISTS ONLINE.
790	THE WESTERN INTERNATIONAL LAW OF TERRITORY STARTS FROM A STANDPOINT OF THE PRIORITY OF THE STATE OVER ITS POPULATION. THE LATTER IS MERELY AN OBJECT OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE STATE. TITLE TO TERRITORY RESTS ON DOMINANT EVIDENCE OF STATE ACTIVITY. THE ACTIVITY OF SO-CALLED PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS OR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF PEOPLES DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS TITLE TO TERRITORY IN THE CASE LAW OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. THIS ARTICLE CONTESTS THE FOUNDATIONS OF SUCH A PERSPECTIVE. THE SO-CALLED WESTERN LAW OF TERRITORY WAS DEVISED BY WESTERN STATES TO DIVIDE UP AMONG THEMSELVES THE TERRITORY OF NON-WESTERN 'NON-PEOPLES', CULMINATING IN THE RACIST ISLAND OF PALMAS ARBITRATION. CARL SCHMITT PROVIDES THE MAKINGS OF AN ALTERNATIVE HISTORY OF THE LAW OF TERRITORY. IT IS, AND SHOULD BE, THE LAW OF THE HOMELANDS OF PEOPLES, HISTORICALLY LOCATED ON PARTICULAR SPACES. PEOPLES PRECEDE STATES, WHICH ARE MERELY INSTITUTIONS USED BY PEOPLES TO PROTECT AND ADMINISTER THEIR HOMELANDS. WHATEVER THE DIFFICULTIES OF LOCATING THE HOMELANDS TO WHICH PEOPLES BELONG, ESCAPE INTO THE SO-CALLED WESTERN LAW OF TERRITORY AS A WAY TO `PEACE THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW' IS AN ILLUSION - DESCRIBED CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY THE POLITICAL THEORIST RAYMOND ARON AS A LAW OF EMPTY SPACES. WITHOUT JUSTICE, THERE IS NO LAW.
791	MUCH OF WHAT WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT THE RULES OF EVIDENCE-THAT THEY SERVE AS AN ALL-SEEING GATEKEEPER, CHECKING EVIDENCE FOR RELEVANCE AND TRUSTWORTHINESS, SCREENING IT FOR UNFAIR PREJUDICE-IS SIMPLY WRONG. IN COURTROOMS EVERY DAY, FACT FINDERS RELY ON "EVIDENCE"-FOR EXAMPLE, A STYLE OF DRESS, THE PRESENCE OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE GALLERY, AND OF COURSE RACE-THAT RARELY PASSES AS EVIDENCE IN THE FORMAL SENSE, AND THUS BREEZES PAST EVIDENTIARY GATEKEEPERS UNSEEN AND UNCHECKED. THIS ARTICLE CALLS MUCH NEEDED ATTENTION TO THIS OTHER EVIDENCE AND DEMONSTRATES THAT SUCH UNREGULATED EVIDENCE MATTERS. JURORS USE THIS OTHER EVIDENCE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO FIND FOR A PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT, WHETHER A DEFENDANT SHOULD GO FREE OR BE DEPRIVED OF LIBERTY, EVEN WHETHER A DEFENDANT IS DESERVING OF LIFE OR DEATH. MORE BROADLY, THE ROLE OF OTHER EVIDENCE BELIES WHAT WE TELL OURSELVES ABOUT THE WAY JUSTICE WORKS, THAT IT IS BASED ON THE "RULE OF LAW." THE TRUTH IS LESS COMFORTING. THE DETERMINATION OF OUTCOMES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE RULES OF EVIDENCE, IS OFTEN RULELESS. TO ADDRESS THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS, THIS ARTICLE FIRST OFFERS A MODEST PROPOSAL-A SIMPLE JURY INSTRUCTION AND DIRECTIVE. IT THEN OFFERS A SOLUTION THAT IS ANYTHING BUT MODEST-A RADICAL RETHINKING OF THE RULES OF EVIDENCE.
792	PIRACY OFF THE COAST OF SOMALIA HAS ELICITED A GROWING BODY OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. MUCH OF THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON IDENTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES OF PIRACY, ANALYZING ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE RESPONSES, OR EVALUATING VARIOUS RULE-OF-LAW APPROACHES; NO STUDY HAS YET TO EXAMINE HOW SOMALI PIRACY HAS IMPACTED PRISONS. DRAWING UPON ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW UNODC COUNTER PIRACY FUNDING IS RESHAPING THE CARCERAL SPACES OF EAST AFRICA. I EXAMINE HOW THE NEED TO SECURE AND DEVELOP SOMALI PIRACY PRISONERS IN REGIONAL PRISONS HAS CREATED A BODIES-FOR-AID PENAL MARKET IN EAST AFRICA. LARGE AID PACKAGES ARE AWARDED TO PRISONS THAT AGREE TO ACCEPT SUSPECTED SOMALI PIRATES AND ENSURE THE SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE LIVES OF SOMALI PIRACY PRISONERS. I THEORIZE A NEW FORM OF PENAL AIDBIOPOLITICAL PENAL AIDLINKING PRISON DEVELOPMENT FUNDING TO THE CONTAINMENT OF SPECIFIC PRISONER POPULATIONS. USING THE MONTAGNE POSEE PRISON IN THE SEYCHELLES AS A CASE STUDY, I EXPLORE HOW BIOPOLITICAL PENAL AID IS RESHAPING PRISON SPACES AND PRACTICES TO TEASE OUT UNDERLYING TENSIONS BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL SECURITY PROJECTS, HOW THESE PROJECTS ARE NEGOTIATED AND APPROPRIATED AT DIFFERENT SCALES, AND HOW THEY ARE BEING EXPERIENCED BY STAFF AND SOMALI PIRACY PRISONERS.
793	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CONFLICTS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. THESE ARE USED AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE SEMANTIC PERSISTENCE OF SOVEREIGNTY AND THE NEW JURISPRUDENCE EMERGING IN THE POST-SOVEREIGN CONSTELLATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. AFTER A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES, CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AT THE TIME OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE LISBON TREATY ARE ANALYZED TO SHOW DIFFERENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY BY DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL BODIES. IN THIS STRUGGLE, THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT EVENTUALLY FORMULATED THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY AS PART OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL GLOBALIZATION. THE COURT CONSIDERS SOVEREIGNTY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ACHIEVING THE POST-NATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY BEYOND THE CLASSICAL NOTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS AND STATE ORGANIZATION. THIS APPROACH IS PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT, FOR INSTANCE, FROM THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S MORE TRADITIONAL DUALISTIC PERSPECTIVE OF NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW. IT ALSO HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S RECENT CONFLICT WITH THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU IN THE LANDTOVA CASE. THE ARTICLE, THEREFORE, CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT THE COURT'S DOCTRINE OF SOVEREIGNTY SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE COURT'S TRADITION OF FUNDAMENTAL VALUE JUDGMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS.
794	FROM THE EARLY 1990S ONWARDS, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM CIVIL CONFLICT HAVE UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC LIBERAL REFORM VIA A PROCESS OF POST-CONFLICT PEACE-BUILDING. UNDERLYING SUCH A PROCESS IS THE HEGEMONIC DISCOURSE OF LIBERAL PEACE THAT AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT AND DEVELOP POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES ALONG THE CORE IDEAS OF DEMOCRATIZATION, ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE UNIVERSALLY BENEFICIAL AND THUS ACCEPTABLE TO ALL. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE AS SUCH LIBERALIZATION CAN PRODUCE INEQUALITY, EXACERBATE PERCEPTIONS OF RELATIVE DEPRIVATION THAT CAUSE A RESURGENCE IN POST-CONFLICT INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND CRIME. IN ORDER TO SHED LIGHT ON THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN ITS NORMATIVE POSITIVE ASSUMPTIONS WITH THE CONTRASTING REALITY OF ITS OUTCOMES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A NECESSARY CRITIQUE OF LIBERAL PEACE DISCOURSE BY EXAMINING ITS LIBERAL ECONOMIC UNDERPINNINGS. IN DOING SO, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT THE LIBERAL PEACE AGENDA EMBODIES INEQUALITIES AND FAILS TO CONSIDER THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH RISING LEVELS OF POST-WAR CRIME AND VIOLENCE. AS SUCH, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LIBERAL PEACE AS A ROUTE TO POST-WAR DEVELOPMENT IS PUT UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT AND SUBJECTED TO THEORETICAL SCRUTINY.
795	EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF DOMESTIC LEGAL TRADITIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE DEMONSTRATE THAT COMMON LAW STATES HAVE BETTER ECONOMIC FREEDOMS, STRONGER INVESTOR PROTECTION, MORE DEVELOPED CAPITAL MARKETS, AND BETTER PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION THAN STATES WITH CIVIL LAW, ISLAMIC LAW, OR MIXED LEGAL TRADITIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXPANDS UPON THE LITERATURE BY EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOMESTIC LEGAL TRADITIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES. THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COMMON LAW STATES HAVE BETTER HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES ON AVERAGE THAN CIVIL LAW, ISLAMIC LAW, OR MIXED LAW STATES BECAUSE THE PROCEDURAL FEATURES OF COMMON LAW SUCH AS THE ADVERSARIAL TRIAL SYSTEM, THE RELIANCE ON ORAL ARGUMENTATION, AND STARE DECISIS RESULT IN GREATER JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN THESE LEGAL SYSTEMS. WE ALSO EXAMINE HOW THE QUALITY OF A STATE'S LEGAL SYSTEM INFLUENCES REPRESSION FOCUSING ON COLONIAL LEGACY, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. A GLOBAL CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS OF STATE-YEARS FROM 1976 TO 2006 SHOWS THAT STATES WITH COMMON LAW TRADITIONS ENGAGE IN BETTER HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES THAN STATES WITH OTHER LEGAL SYSTEMS. THIS RESULT HOLDS WHEN CONTROLLING FOR THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND STANDARD EXPLANATIONS FOR STATES' HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES (ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGIME TYPE, POPULATION SIZE, MILITARY REGIME, AND WAR INVOLVEMENT).
796	THE EMERGENCE OF AFRICAN STATES AS INDEPENDENT BY 1970 HAD BROUGHT HOPE AND EXPECTATIONS TO NATIONALS THAT THE WINDS OF CHANGE WERE TO BE EQUATED WITH GOOD LIFE AND FREEDOM. YET, NO SOONER HAD POLITICAL FREEDOM BEEN GAINED THAN EXPECTATIONS TURNED ELUSIVE. THE CAUSES WERE BAD POLITICAL GOVERNANCE THAT SOON BURDENED MANY STATES, MILITARY INTERVENTIONS OF ONE-PARTY STATES, ABUSE OF RULE OF LAW, MASS CORRUPTION AND NATIONS DISINTEGRATING. ALSO, THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM AND DIGNITY WAS NOT HELPED BY A CONTINENTAL UNION THAT FOCUSED SOLELY ON POLITICAL LIBERATION OF AFRICA AND IGNORED ANY CONCERTED EFFORT TOWARDS INTEGRATION AND PROMOTION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC LIVES OF PEOPLE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POLITICAL TREMORS THAT HAD ENGULFED SOME STATES IN AFRICA AND THE RESULTANT INTERVENTION BY FOREIGN POWERS. IT IS ARGUED, THAT A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE POLITICAL RUFFLE IN TUNISIA, THE COTE D'IVOIRE, EGYPT AND LIBYA HAD BEEN THE INABILITY OF THE AFRICAN UNION TO BE PRO-ACTIVE IN ENFORCING NORMS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AMONG MEMBER-STATES THROUGH ITS INSPECTING AGENCY, THE AFRICAN PEER REVIEW. THE APPARENT POLITICAL PARALYSIS IS THEREFORE A FUNCTION OF AN AFRICAN UNION IMPOTENCE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED UNDERLYING THE TREMORS ARE ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM FOR WHICH A THEORETICAL DISCOURSE IS ENGAGED.
797	DURING THE 1990S, THE POLICY TOWARDS ROMA, DISCUSSED AT TRANS-NATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEVELS, HAS OSCILLATED BETWEEN USE OF MINORITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONCEPTS, DEVELOPMENTAL, ANTI-POVERTY AND SECURITY CONCEPTS. THESE CONCEPTS USED FOR ANALYSING THE SITUATION OF ROMA HAVE INFLUENCED NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHO ROMA ARE, BUT ALSO THE UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHICH POLICY MEASURES ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR ADDRESSING THEIR SITUATION. THE EUROPEAN UNION, EQUIPPED IN THE PRE2004/2007 EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ACCESSION WITH THE LEVERAGE OF EU MEMBERSHIP AND COPENHAGEN CRITERIA REQUIRING STABILITY OF MINORITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS GUARANTEEING DEMOCRACY IN THE EU ACCESSION STATES, HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE 2004/2007 ACCESSION PHASE ON ADDRESSING THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF ROMA. FOLLOWING EU ACCESSION IN 2004 AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY, THE EU WAS FURTHER INSTRUMENTAL IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATION OF ROMA. CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO A SHIFT IN POLICY ON ROMA, USING THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, TYPICAL FOR AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AND TRANS-NATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS, PHILANTHROPIC ORGANISATIONS, HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, STATES AND ROMA. TH IS ARTICLE WILL PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE OF THE LINK BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE EU AND POINT OUT EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL INFLUENCES THAT CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS HAVE EXERCISED WITHIN BOTH PERIODS.
798	THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA HAS LED THE CHINESE PEOPLE IN CREATING THEIR COUNTRY'S SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT WHOSE OUTCOME CONTRASTS WITH THE "WESTERN CHAOS" EXEMPLIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHINA, THE UNITED STATES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED THE POLITICAL PATH, INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS, DEMOCRATIC FORMS, AND OTHER FACTORS BEHIND THE RISE OF CHINA AND THE DECLINE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE RESULTS OF MORE THAN 40 RECENT STUDIES CONDUCTED BY MORE THAN A DOZEN OF CHINESE AND FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS SHOW THAT IN REALISTIC TERMS, CHINA HAS RECORDED A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE AND SHOWN GREATER POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT THAN THE UNITED STATES IN FIVE AREAS: TRUST IN GOVERNMENT; DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNANCE; INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE; AND NATIONAL MENTALITY. IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, CHINA'S SYSTEM OF POLITICAL DISCOURSE NEEDS TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE BASIS OF A CORRECT CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY AND COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT. IT IS NECESSARY TO END THE MONOPOLY OF THE WEST IN THE AREA OF DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE; TO BREAK FROM DEPENDENCE ON THE LOGIC OF WESTERN-STYLE DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE; AND TO ENHANCE CHINA'S INITIATIVE AND INFLUENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR PUBLIC OPINION.
799	WILDLIFE CRIME THREATENS NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SECURITY. MUCH OF THE IMPACT OF WILDLIFE CRIME IS FELT OVERSEAS, OFTEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE IT THREATENS TO CATALYZE CONFLICTS, HINDERS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, AND THREATENS PEACE, AMONGST HAVING OTHER NEGATIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND SECURITY IMPACTS. BUT THE IMPACT OF WILDLIFE CRIME ALSO IS FELT IN UNITED STATES, BOTH DIRECTLY BY UNDERCUTTING STATE AND LOCAL CONSERVATION EFFORTS, AND INDIRECTLY, BY INJECTING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE PRODUCTS INTO UNITED STATES MARKETS. WHILE SOME WORK HAS DELVED INTO THE SENTENCING DYNAMICS OF BROADER ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXPLORED THE SENTENCING OF WILDLIFE CRIME, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS BEING DISTINCT IN NATURE BY BOTH GOVERNMENTAL BODIES AND ACADEMICS ALIKE. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORES THE FEDERAL PROSECUTIONS OF WILDLIFE CRIMES, FOCUSING ON PROFILING THE WILDLIFE CRIME CASES CHARGED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ). BY PROFILING CASES, WE AIM TO EXPLORE (1) THE APPLICATION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH WILDLIFE CRIME CASES VIA THEIR JUDGMENT DOCUMENTS; (2) THE WILDLIFE SPECIES INVOLVED IN PROSECUTED CASES; (3) THE DISTRIBUTION OF CASES ACROSS US FEDERAL DISTRICTS; AND (4) AND THE SENTENCING PATTERNS OF WILDLIFE CRIMES. FURTHER STATISTICAL ANALYSES EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN A VARIETY OF THE VARIABLES EXTRACTED. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SET FORTH ACCORDINGLY.
800	THE ROLE OF COURTS HAS BEEN RATHER SIGNIFICANT IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WEAKENING THE THEORY THAT THE JUDICIARY IS NOT EQUIPPED TO CONTRIBUTE TO GOVERNING CRISIS MANAGEMENT. ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES EXIST ACROSS COUNTRIES, DEPENDING ON INSTITUTIONAL VARIETIES AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS, THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT, EVEN IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY, COURTS CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BALANCE TO THE POWER SHIFT TOWARDS THE EXECUTIVES. BOTH ACTION AND INACTION AFFECTING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SCRUTINISED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND THE RULE OF LAW. DEFERENCE TO POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING HAS VARIED ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND ACROSS THE MULTIPLE PHASES OF THE HEALTH CRISIS. DIFFERENCES IN THE BALANCING HAVE EMERGED COMPARED TO DURING ORDINARY TIMES. UNCERTAINTY HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE, CALLING FOR NEW STRATEGIES IN REGULATORY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING AND NEW BALANCES BETWEEN PRECAUTION AND EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES. THE ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS BEEN AT THE CORE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND PROCEDURAL ACCOUNTABILITY. PROPORTIONALITY AND REASONABLENESS WITH MULTIPLE CONCEPTUAL VARIANTS ACROSS COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN USED TO SCRUTINISE THE LEGALITY OF MEASURES. COURTS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT BUT DIFFERENT ROLE IN THE YEARS TO COME, WHEN LIABILITY ISSUES AND RECOVERY MEASURES WILL LIKELY BECOME THE CORE OF LITIGATION.
801	LATIN AMERICA HAS PROVIDED A FERTILE GROUND FOR CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERIMENTATION. THE ECUADOREAN CONSTITUTION OF 2008 PURPORTED TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL AND REPLACE IT WITH ONE IN WHICH INDIGENOUS CONCEPTS FROM THE ANDEAN REGION ARE CENTRAL. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE LEGAL ORDER WAS NOT REPUDIATED, AND A REINFORCED PROCEDURE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WAS STILL INCLUDED. IT SEEMS, HOWEVER, THAT EVEN AN EXTENDED RIGHTS CATALOGUE AND REINFORCED AMENDMENT PROCEDURES COULD FAIL TO INDUCE A REAL PARADIGM CHANGE IF THE COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION AS HIGHER LAW IS MISSING. THE PRESENT ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW THAT MORE FLEXIBLE AMENDMENT RULES MIGHT FOSTER THE RULE OF LAW AND STABILITY BETTER THAN THOSE THAT ARE UNREALISTIC OR BLUNTLY IDEOLOGICAL, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTION-AS-HIGHER-LAW IS NOT AUTHENTICALLY REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNED SOCIETY. IN THESE CASES, FLEXIBLE AMENDMENT RULES COULD HELP RESTORE TRUST IN LAW'S AUTHORITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THEY COULD ALSO ASSIST IN GUIDING POLITICAL ACTIONS UNDER THE GUISE OF LAW, INSTEAD OF SURRENDERING THEM TO A MERE POLITICAL POWER STRUGGLE. BUILDING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF A SERIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUBSTITUTIONS FROM ECUADOR'S THREE MAIN CONSTITUTIONAL PHASES, THE ARTICLE STRIVES TO ENRICH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES RELATED TO AMENDMENT DIFFICULTY, INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, AND CONSTITUTIONAL CULTURE.
802	ARE POPULIST ACTORS MORE LIKE A HURRICANE THAT RISKS UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY? OR DO THEY AIM FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH STRENGTHENS POPULAR CONTROL? THIS ARTICLE OFFERS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE, SYSTEMATIC ANALYSES ON THE IMPACT OF POPULISM ON MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY. GOING BEYOND THE VIEW OF 'HIGH-' OR 'LOW-QUALITY' DEMOCRACIES, WE EMPHASIZE THAT THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IS RELATED TO MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OR 'FUNCTIONS OF DEMOCRACY', CHARACTERIZED BY IMPORTANT TRADE-OFFS. WE ARGUE THAT POPULIST ACTORS EXERT DIFFERENTIATED EFFECTS ACROSS THESE FUNCTIONS, DEPENDING ON THEIR DEGREE OF GOVERNMENT ACCESS AND HOST IDEOLOGY. OUR ANALYSIS RELIES ON A NEW DISAGGREGATED DATASET COVERING 53 ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES IN DIVERSE WORLD REGIONS OVER THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1990 AND 2016. WE FIND THAT POPULIST ACTORS INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND REPRESENTATION, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE CONFINED TO THE OPPOSITION AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY BELONG TO THE POLITICAL LEFT-WING. IN CONTRAST, WE FIND A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF POPULISTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM ON INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND STATE TRANSPARENCY. IN SUM, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT POPULISM HAS A VARIABLE IMPACT ON MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITY WHICH SHOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED IN A DISAGGREGATED MANNER THAT IS SENSITIVE TO THESE DIFFERENCES.
803	THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE LINK BETWEEN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, ALSO CONSIDERING SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES, AS WELL AS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) SET IN THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. BY ESTIMATING PANEL DATA REGRESSION MODELS FOR A SAMPLE OF 11 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, FROM 2003 TO 2016, THE EMPIRICAL OUTCOMES PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR A NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FDI AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA. REGARDING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, IT IS FOUND THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE GROWTH, WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM IS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. MOREOVER, SDGS SUCH AS POVERTY, INCOME DISTRIBUTION, EDUCATION, INNOVATION, TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARE NOTEWORTHY DRIVERS OF GROWTH. THE OUTCOMES OF PANEL FULLY MODIFIED AND DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES PARTLY CONFIRM THE FINDINGS. THE PANEL VECTOR ERROR-CORRECTION MODEL GRANGER CAUSALITIES PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR A SHORT-RUN ONE-WAY CAUSAL ASSOCIATION RUNNING FROM FDI TO GROWTH AND A LONG-RUN TWO-WAY CAUSAL CONNECTION AMONG FDI AND GROWTH. FURTHERMORE, IN THE LONG RUN, UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS RUNNING FROM EACH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATOR TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FDI ARE SET OUT.
804	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DISCUSS THE SPACE OF RELIGION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE WITHIN A DEMOCRATICALLY INCLINED RULE OF LAW. THE TEXT HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL STATE INFLUENCED THE SUPERVENIENCE OF A RESTRICTIVE CONCEPTION OF THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, CREATING A CONCEPT OF TOLERANCE AS "INDIFFERENCE", BASED ON ABSOLUTE DISSOCIATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPACE. IT CORRELATES TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE VIEW THAT REMOVES THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT FROM PUBLIC DEBATE AND, ESPECIALLY, FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL SPHERE OF THE STATE, TO THE POSTMODERN WORLDVIEW. STEMMING FROM THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY, IT DEFENDS THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE CONCEPT OF LIBERAL TOLERANCE TO HANDLE A SOCIETY CHARACTERIZED AS "POST-SECULAR" IN DEMANDING THAT THE STATE ENGAGE WITH THE RELIGIOUS ELEMENT. BASED ON TEXTS BY JURGEN HABERMAS AND MICHAEL SANDEL, THE ARTICLE DEFENDS NOT ONLY THE POSSIBILITY BUT ALSO THE EFFECTIVE NEED FOR, AS LONG AS DETERMINED EPISTEMOLOGICAL POSTULATES ARE FOLLOWED, THE RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT TO BE INCORPORATED TO THE POLITICAL AND EVEN INSTITUTIONAL DEBATE. IT DEFENDS THE NECESSITY OF SUBSTITUTING THE IDEA OF NEUTRALITY AS "INDIFFERENCE" FOR NEUTRALITY AS "INCLUSION", AS MORE ABLE TO FACILITATE THE APPEARANCE OF A SOCIAL AND LEGAL SCENARIO OF GREATER COMMITMENT TO MORAL DIVERGENCES AND GREATER DEMOCRATIC DENSITY.
805	WE EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF CORPORATE COMPENSATION POLICIES ON FIRMS' TAX AGGRESSIVENESS IN AN EMERGING MARKET WHERE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IS PRIMARILY IN CASH FORM. BASED ON A HAND-COLLECTED DATASET OF 958 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS OF CHINESE LISTED FIRMS FOR THE 2006-2012 PERIOD, WE FIND THAT FIRMS PAYING HIGHER EXECUTIVE CASH COMPENSATION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER TAX AGGRESSIVENESS. THIS RELATIONSHIP ALSO HOLDS FOR THE EXCESS CASH COMPENSATION MEASURES WHICH CONTROL FOR EXECUTIVE SHAREHOLDING, FIRM PROFITABILITY, SIZE, GROWTH OPPORTUNITY, AND BOARD INDEPENDENCE. WE FURTHER DOCUMENT THAT MUTUAL FUNDS OWNERSHIP PRESSURE FIRMS PAYING HIGHER COMPENSATION TO REDUCE THEIR TAX AGGRESSIVENESS, SUGGESTING ADVERSE SELECTION BY MUTUAL FUNDS ON FIRMS EXHIBITING RISKY TAX AVOIDANCE ACTIVITIES. HIGH LEVERAGE OFFSETS THE NEGATIVE LINK BETWEEN CASH COMPENSATION AND TAX AGGRESSIVENESS, INDICATING A COMPLEMENTARY EFFECT BETWEEN DEBT AND TAX AVOIDANCE, AND, HENCE, SUGGESTING THAT CREDITOR MONITORING IS WEAK. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO THE SYSTEM-GMM ESTIMATION, WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR THE ENDOGENEITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, TAX AGGRESSIVENESS, OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL, LEVERAGE, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. OUR FINDINGS ON CHINESE FIRMS HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WITH CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE, WEAK INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION, INEFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, AND ONGOING SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION.
806	GLOBALIZATION TRANSFORMS MOST NATIONAL INTO TRANSNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS (PGS), WHICH NO STATE CAN PROTECT UNILATERALLY WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL LAW AND MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN AND COSMOPOLITAN CONSTITUTIONALISM HAVE PROVEN TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE "LEGAL METHODS" FOR PROTECTING TRANSNATIONAL "AGGREGATE PGS" LIKE OPEN, RULES-BASED MARKETS AND PUBLIC HEALTH (I). THEY REQUIRE CHALLENGING THE "CHESSBOARD PARADIGM" OF "DISCONNECTED UN/WTO GOVERNANCE" BY PROMOTING "REPUBLICAN NETWORK GOVERNANCE" EMPOWERING CITIZENS TO INVOKE AND ENFORCE INTERNATIONAL `PGS TREATIES" LIKE UN, WHO AND WTO AGREEMENTS PROTECTING EQUAL RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, PUBLIC HEALTH AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL MARKETS ACROSS NATIONAL FRONTIERS INSIDE DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEMS. EVEN IF "GLOBAL DEMOCRACY" AND "GLOBAL JUSTICE" ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN UTOPIAS FOR A LONG TIME, STRONGER REPUBLICAN AND COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES CAN EMPOWER AND MOTIVATE CITIZENS AS "REPUBLICAN OWNERS" OF PGS (RES PUBLICA) AND "DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS" OF GOVERNMENTS TO CHALLENGE AND LIMIT "MARKET FAILURES" AND "GOVERNANCE FAILURES" THROUGH "COUNTERVAILING RIGHTS" (II). "CONNECTING" INTERDEPENDENT LOCAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF "AGGREGATE PGS" THROUGH COSMOPOLITAN RIGHTS AND "MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONALISM" CAN STRENGTHEN "REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE" OF PGS, WHOSE EFFECTIVENESS IS EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED BY RIGHTS -BASED COMMERCIAL, TRADE, INVESTMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LABOUR, ENVIRONMENTAL, CRIMINAL, HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW PROMOTING ACCOUNTABLE "BOTTOM-UP GOVERNANCE" OF PGS BEYOND NATIONAL BORDERS (III-IV).
807	THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT UNDERPIN THE CONCEPT OF SHAM ARE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, TO PREVENT ABUSE OF FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES, TO PRESERVE THE LAW'S GOOD REPUTATION AND PREVENT EVASION OF STATUTE. THE ORIGINAL TEST WAS WIDE AND DID NOT REQUIRE PROOF OF A JOINT INTENTION TO GIVE A FALSE IMPRESSION. THE TEST FOR SHAM WAS GREATLY NARROWED BY SNOOK V LONDON AND WEST RIDING INVESTMENT LTD WHICH HAS BEEN APPLIED TO TRUSTS, THOUGH IT IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT DIPLOCK LJ INTENDED THIS. THE RECENT DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN AUTOCLENZ V BELCHER SUGGESTS THAT EQUALITY OF BARGAINING POSITION BETWEEN ARM'S LENGTH PARTIES TO A COMMERCIAL CONTACT PROVIDES A SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARD AGAINST COLLUSIVE ABUSE OF THE SNOOK KIND. WHERE THIS IS ABSENT, THE SUPREME COURT CONSIDERED GREATER VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED. AUTOCLENZ CONCERNED EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS, BUT THE INEQUALITY OF BARGAINING POSITION WHEN A TRUST IS CREATED, COUPLED WITH THE OBSERVED INSTANCES OF ABUSE, MIGHT CALL FOR A MORE INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH AND, ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT, LEAD TO A TEST BASED ON WHETHER THE TRUST INSTRUMENT REFLECTED THE TRUE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES WHICH WOULD BE 'GLEANED FROM ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, OF WHICH THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT IS ONLY A PART'. THESE MATTERS ARE CONSIDERED IN THIS ARTICLE.
808	THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (ECJ) IS SHAPED BY THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH IT IS DRAFTED-I.E. FRENCH. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FRENCH IS RARELY THE MOTHER TONGUE OF THOSE DRAFTING THAT CASE LAW, THE TEXTS PRODUCED ARE OFTEN STILTED AND AWKWARD. IN ADDITION, THOSE DRAFTING SUCH CASE LAW ARE CONSTRAINED IN THEIR USE OF LANGUAGE AND STYLE OF WRITING (OWING TO PRESSURES OF TECHNOLOGY AND IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW). THESE FACTORS HAVE LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 'COURT FRENCH' WHICH NECESSARILY SHAPES THE CASE LAW PRODUCED AND HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY INSOFAR AS IT INEVITABLY LEADS TO A TYPE OF PRECEDENT IN THAT CASE LAW. THAT CASE LAW ALSO UNDERGOES MANY PERMUTATIONS OF TRANSLATION INTO AND OUT OF UP TO 23 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. THE RESULTANT TEXTS THAT MAKE UP THE CASE LAW ARE HYBRID IN NATURE-CONSISTING OF A BLEND OF CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC PATTERNS, CONSTRAINED BY A RIGID FORMULISTIC DRAFTING STYLE AND PUT THROUGH MANY PERMUTATIONS OF TRANSLATION. THE PRESENT PAPER INVESTIGATES THE PRODUCTION OF THE COURT'S MULTILINGUAL CASE LAW AND CONSIDERS WHETHER THE HYBRID NATURE OF THAT CASE LAW CAN ACTUALLY AID THE PRESENTATION (AND THUS THE DEVELOPMENT) OF A 'UNIFORM' EU CASE LAW.
809	GERMAN GEOPOLITICAL CLAIMS HAVE CHANGED FROM TWO PHASES OF AGGRESSIVE, MILITARY EXPANSIONISM (JACKBOOTS) AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TO A CIVILIANISED FOREIGN POLICY (BIRKENSTOCKS) AT ITS END. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THIS TRANSITION DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN LIGHT OF A CHANGING INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AND THE GEOPOLITICAL CONSTELLATIONS OF THE COLD WAR AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. AS PART OF SUCH HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES, EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERNAL PREFERENCES THE CIVILIAN POWER CONCEPT BECAME THE FOUNDATION FOR THE BERLIN REPUBLIC'S GRAND STRATEGY OF PROMOTING CIVILIANISED STRUCTURES IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. UNLIKE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY AFTER REUNIFICATION IN 1990 WAS NOT BASED ON A DELIBERATELY PURSUED STRATEGY OF MILITARISTIC POWER POLITICS TO ATTAIN WORLD POWER STATUS. IT REFLECTED A FOREIGN POLICY IDENTITY INTO WHICH GERMANY 'GREW' DURING THE COLD WAR IN A PROCESS OF ADAPTING AND BECOMING PART OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND AMERICAN HEGEMONY. EVEN THOUGH GERMANY DID NOT COMPLETELY ABANDON ITS POWER AMBITIONS, THEIR ARTICULATIONS AND CLAIMS WERE RADICALLY TRANSFORMED. A CIVILIANISED INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM THEREBY BECAME THE OBJECTIVE AND MEDIUM OF GERMAN FOREIGN POLICY. SUCH A SYSTEM IS CHARACTERISED BY MULTILATERALISM, SUPRANATIONAL INTEGRATION, STRONG INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, RULE OF LAW, FREE TRADE, HUMAN RIGHTS, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE USE OF FORCE.
810	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PERSONAL INFLUENCE MODEL (PIM) BE USED STRATEGICALLY TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS AND SOCIAL CRISES IN AFRICA. IT PRESENTS PIM AS A COMPLEMENTARY, ANALYTIC DISCOURSE TO PARTICIPATORY COMMUNICATION, A DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM COMMONLY USED GLOBALLY IN A VARIETY OF SOCIAL PROGRAMS. THAT DISCOURSE, AS A FRAMEWORK FOR THEORY BUILDING, IS GROUNDED IN AFRICA'S EMERGING AND ENDURING REALITIES: (A) THE GROWING INTEREST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ASSIST AFRICA TO MEET THE U.N. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS, WHOSE FOCUS IS TO REDUCE EXTREME POVERTY BY 2015; (B) THE EPHEMERAL NATURE OF AFRICA'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY THAT NECESSITATES REDUCING FEAR, IMPROVING COMMUNITY SECURITY, NURTURING PUBLIC TRUST, AND BUILDING INTER-GROUP RELATIONSHIPS, ALL AS PRECONDITIONS FOR ATTAINING SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND FOR USING A COMMUNITY-AGENCY-CONTRACTS-PARTNERSHIPS APPROACH TO DELIVER DEVELOPMENT SERVICES; AND (C) THE PALPABLE CONGRUENCE OF PIM WITH AFRICA'S EXTENSIVE SOCIAL NETWORKS, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY USED AS COMMUNICATION TOOLS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THOSE REALITIES GUIDE FOUR PROPOSITIONS THAT SERVE AS A HEURISTIC TEMPLATE FOR TESTING AND REFINING THE PARTICIPATORY APPROACH, THEREBY GUIDING THEORY BUILDING IN PARTICIPATORY COMMUNICATION IN AFRICAN COMMUNITIES. THAT TEMPLATE IDENTIFIES AN EXPANSIVE THREE-CONCEPT RESEARCH AGENDA - CULTURE, COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW, AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM - THAT RAISES QUESTIONS, DEFINES CONCEPTS, MEASURES KEY VARIABLES, AND ASSESSES OUTCOMES.
811	IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR PHILIP FRICKEY ARGUES THAT IN FEDERAL INDIAN LAW, THE RULE OF LAW SERVES REMARKABLY DIVERGENT PURPOSES, JUSTIFYING COLONIALISM IN THE PURSUIT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. BECAUSE OF ITS ROOTS IN THIS ANTINOMY, FEDERAL INDIAN LAW HAS BEEN REMARKABLY INCOHERENT. THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY TROUBLED BY NOT ONLY THE INCOHERENCE INSIDE THE FIELD, BUT ALSO THE EXTENT TO WHICH ITS DOCTRINES DEVIATE FROM GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN LAW. IN FACT, FRUSTRATION WITH THE INTRACTABILITY OF THE ISSUES HAS RECENTLY LED SEVERAL JUSTICES TO PROPOSE THAT THE COURT SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY THE FIRST SAY ON SENSITIVE ISSUES, BUT THE FINAL SAY AS WELL. THESE PROPOSALS TRIGGER "THE SEDUCTION OF COHERENCE," THE LAWYERLY URGE TO AMELIORATE INCONSISTENT POLICY IMPLICATIONS. PROFESSOR FRICKEY CONTENDS THAT THESE QUESTIONS CANNOT BE RESOLVED WITHOUT RECOGNITION OF THE EXCEPTIONALISM OF FEDERAL INDIAN LAW. THE SOLUTION IS TO RECOGNIZE THE "COURAGE OF OUR CONFUSIONS" RATHER THAN EMBRACE THE ALTERNATIVE - SOME SMALLER CERTAINTY THAT IMPOSES ARTIFICIAL COHERENCE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL DOCTRINAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND NORMATIVE FEATURES OF THE FIELD. PROFESSOR FRICKEY CONCLUDES THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS THE INSTITUTION LEAST ABLE TO GENERATE A SATISFACTORY, DIALOGIC INTEGRATION OF OUR COLONIAL ROOTS WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND THUS NEEDS TO STAND ASIDE.
812	ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE (TRIBUNALS), INTEGRATED JUSTICE (DRUG COURTS), COMMUNITY JUSTICE (SENTENCING CIRCLES OR "CONFERENCING"), GROUP JUSTICE (ULYSSES AGREEMENTS), AND CONTRACTUAL JUSTICE (PRIVATE "SETTLEMENTS") ARE NEW WAYS OF TACKLING OLD PROBLEMS; OFTEN ONES INVOLVING VULNERABLE GROUPS.VULNERABLE GROUPS POSE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE SHOULD INTERVENE, IN WHAT WAYS, AND WHETHER THROUGH THE LEGAL, MEDICAL, OR WELFARE SYSTEMS. NEW PROGRAMS, WITH NEW OBJECTIVES AND NEW SECTORAL BOUNDARIES, NECESSARILY RAISE NEW QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS ABOUT ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS. QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPLICATIONS FOR "CITIZENSHIP", OR FOR THE RULE OF LAW, OR FOR DISTRIBUTIONAL EQUITY.AND QUESTIONS ABOUT PROGRAM "EFFECTIVENESS". THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES COMMON THEMES AND PATTERNS IN THE REFORMS, INCLUDING "ACTIVE" RATHER THAN PASSIVE ADJUDICATION, JUDICIAL COMMITMENT TO REALISATION OF IDENTIFIED GOALS, INTERSECTORAL COLLABORATION, COMMUNITY IN-PUT OR CONTROL, AND USE OF PRIVATISED "CONTRACTUALIST" METAPHORS. IT CONSIDERS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS REFLECTS GLOBALISATION (HARMONISATION WITH CIVIL LAW EXPERIENCE), OR IS EMBLEMATIC OF "POSTMODERNISM" (BETTER ATTUNING PROGRAMS TO DIVERSITY AND FLUIDITY), OR OTHER THEORETICAL POSITIONS (SUCH AS CONTRACTUALISM AND REPUBLICAN CITIZENSHIP). IT IS ARGUED THAT THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY WELCOMED, SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS ASSESSMENT OF THEIR MERITS, SINCE THEIR OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC ADOPTION RISKS BREACHES OF FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL, CIVIL CITIZENSHIP, OR MEDICO-LEGAL PERCEPTS, AND MAY ALLOW THEORY TO OUTSTRIP ITS EVIDENTIARY BASE.
813	THE COLD WAR INADVERTENTLY LED TO THE FORMATION OF TWO HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES - WITH SPECIFIC CIVIL RIGHTS BEING ENCOURAGED BY THE WEST AND PARTICIPATORY RIGHTS BY THE EAST. THESE PARTICIPATORY RIGHTS HAVE FOUND THEIR VOICE IN RESOURCE GOVERNANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THIS IS DUE TO LACK OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE, CORRUPTION, AND THE WEAK OR NON-EXISTENT RULE OF LAW. HARNESSING THE BENEFITS OF EXTRACTIVE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PROBLEMATIC, AS THE COUNTRIES CONCERNED FAILED TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THE RESOURCES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESOURCES TRIGGERED VIOLENT CONFLICTS, DESTROYED THE ENVIRONMENT, EXACERBATED INEQUALITIES ACROSS GENDER AND GEOGRAPHY, DISPLACED COMMUNITIES, AND UNDERMINED DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES THAT HAVE LONG-TERM ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY. USING CONTEXT CASE STUDIES, THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN AFRICA. THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS ASKED ARE: WHO DELINEATES THE CONTESTED SPACE OF PARTICIPATION AND HOW ARE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF ORGANIZED PARTICIPATION ADOPTED? THE POTENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATORY DEVELOPMENT MECHANISMS AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN RESOURCE GOVERNANCE IS EXAMINED. ENCOURAGING PARTICIPATION IS INDISPENSABLE FOR ACHIEVING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN VULNERABLE, RESOURCE-RICH ZONES.
814	THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AGENCY (BAPPEDA) WITH P.T.IKPP DISSEMINATES THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (C.S.R.) PROGRAM TO THE PEOPLE OF THE SIAK REGENCY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (C.S.R.) PROGRAM BY THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AGENCY (BAPPEDA) IN SIAK REGENCY. THE RESEARCH METHOD USED IN THIS STUDY USES A QUALITATIVE METHOD WITH A PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THE STUDY RESULTS INDICATED THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (C.S.R.) PROGRAM IS NOT RUNNING OPTIMALLY DUE TO THE INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FIELD AND THE PRINCIPLES USED IN GOOD GOVERNANCE, NAMELY PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY'S CONCLUSION SHOWED THE LACK OF COLLABORATION FROM BAPPEDA WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN PROVIDING REPORTS ON PLANNED PROGRAMS AND EVEN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN REALIZED. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY ACTIVITIES WERE LESS THAN OPTIMAL IN SOCIALIZING WITH THE PEOPLE OF SIAK REGENCY. THIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT P.T. IKPP MAXIMIZES ITS ROLE IN PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE SIAK REGENCY. BAPPEDA MUST FURTHER INCREASE ITS DUTIES IN SUPERVISING THE COMPANY'S IMPLEMENTATION OF C.S.R. IN THE COMMUNITY.
815	BUILDING A CIVIL SERVICE CULTURE, FOCUSING ON ENSURING ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINE AND DISCIPLINE; RAISE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE OPERATION OF AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS; BUILDING A CONTINGENT OF CADRES AND CIVIL SERVANTS LOYAL TO THE STATE; RESPECT AND DEDICATION TO SERVING THE PEOPLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROMOTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, BUILDING AND PERFECTING THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE OF VIETNAM; AT THE SAME TIME AROUSE THE BELIEF, DEDICATION, TALENT, INTELLIGENCE OF THE CIVIL SERVANTS. THE VALUE SYSTEM OF YOUNG CIVIL SERVANTS IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE VIETNAMESE VALUE SYSTEM. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN MARCH 2022 WITH THE SURVEY METHOD USING A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE WITH 656 YOUNG CIVIL SERVANTS AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES (FROM 18 TO 30 YEARS OLD) IN 6 PROVINCES/CITIES INCLUDING: HANOI; HAI PHONG; QUANG BINH; NINH THUAN; HO CHI MINH CITY AND SOC TRANG SHOW: "RESPONSIBILITY; FILIAL; BENEVOLENCE; HONESTY" ARE THE VALUES CONSIDERED BY YOUNG CIVIL SERVANTS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THEMSELVES. YOUNG PEOPLE EXPECT PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO HAVE ENOUGH "VIRTUE" AND "TALENT", THE MOST PROMINENT OF WHICH IS THE MODEL OF "HONESTY" CIVIL SERVANT; RESPONSIBILITY; CULTURED". RESEARCH RESULTS SHOW THAT WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO ANY VALUE, THEY ALSO TEND TO EXPECT SUCH VALUES AND QUALITIES IN PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS.
816	AUTHORITARIAN POPULIST ACTORS RHETORICALLY EMBRACE A CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY AS UNCONSTRAINED MAJORITY RULE. THE MAJORITARIAN CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY CHALLENGES THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AS INSTITUTIONS SAFEGUARDING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW BEYOND MAJORITY RULE. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE TENSION BETWEEN THE COUNTERMAJORITARIAN RATIONALE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND THEM EMBRACING A MAJORITARIAN CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY PROVIDES AN OPENING FOR THE POLITICAL SUCCESS OF AUTHORITARIAN POPULISTS. THE TENSION IS PARTICULARLY PERTINENT IN DECISIONS ON PETITIONS SUBMITTED BY AUTHORITARIAN POPULISTS, WHO THEMSELVES TEND TO INVOKE MAJORITARIAN DEMOCRACY. EMPIRICALLY, THE ARTICLE STUDIES HOW THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CONCEPTUALISED DEMOCRACY IN THE CONTEXT OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION LEADING UP TO THE PIVOTAL 2010 ELECTIONS, WHICH PAVED THE WAY TOWARDS THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM IN HUNGARY. EMPLOYING CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF DECISIONS REFERRING TO DEMOCRACY IN RELATION TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, IT SHOWS THAT, EVEN BEFORE THE CHANGES ADOPTED BY THE POST-2010 PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, THE HUNGARIAN COURT EMBRACED A MAJORITARIAN CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS SEGMENT OF ITS DECISION MAKING. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COURT'S CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY FED INTO AUTHORITARIAN POPULIST RHETORIC. THE FINDINGS CAUTION COURTS WHEN INTERPRETING THE MEANING(S) OF DEMOCRACY AND EMPHASISE THE POTENTIAL AND LIMITS OF JUDICIAL RESPONSES TO AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM.
817	IN ANY STATE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS APPLIED, CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVES TO GUARANTEE THE EFFICIENCY AND LEGITIMACY OF LIABILITY AND ALL LEGALLY SANCTIONED COERCIVE MEASURES. ITS PURPOSE IS ALSO TO ELIMINATE, INSOFAR AS IS POSSIBLE, ANY ARBITRARINESS AND DISHONESTY ARISING IN THE COURSE OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THUS, THE RULES UNDERPINNING CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE, FORMULATED PRECISELY, HARMONIZED, AND BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW, ARE THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF THOSE OBJECTIVES. IN REALITY, HOWEVER, THE ACTIVITY OF THE LEGISLATOR IN DRAFTING NEW LAWS AND SLOWED PROGRESS IN ELIMINATING OUTDATED AND UNJUSTIFIED NORMS CREATES A SITUATION WHERE THE WORDING OF LEGAL CODES GRADUALLY LOSES THEIR SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT CHARACTER. IN RECENT YEARS, THE PHENOMENON OF OVER-CRIMINALIZATION AND STATUTORY AMBIGUITY HAS ATTRACTED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH INTEREST IN CRIMINAL SCIENCE. A NUMBER OF LEGAL CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES ARE USED TO DISCIPLINE THE LEGISLATURE, AND THEREBY ALLOW THE COURTS TO APPLY THE LAW PRUDENTLY AND WITH GREAT CAUTION, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL LEGAL TRADITIONS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THOSE LEGAL PRINCIPLES FOLLOWED BY THE LITHUANIAN COURTS TO ENSURE THE PROPORTIONATE APPLICATION OF SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW AND SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES, INTER ALIA SECRET SURVEILLANCE, THEREBY OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF POORLY DRAFTED LAWS ON HUMAN RIGHTS.
818	THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF THE EU RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX) WITH THOSE OF NATO'S MISSION KOSOVO FORCE (KFOR) AND INVESTIGATES THE REASONS FOR OBSERVED DIFFERENCES. IT FOCUSES ON AN OFT-OVERLOOKED ASPECT OF EULEX: ITS BROADLY DEFINED SECURITY-RELATED TASKS. UNTIL RECENTLY, EULEX COULD BE SEEN AS A PROMINENT SECURITY ACTOR, THANKS TO ITS ROBUST POLICE COMPONENT AND ITS FUNCTION AS A SECOND RESPONDENT. EULEX COEXISTS IN KOSOVO WITH KFOR; WHILE THE FORMER IS CIVILIAN AND THE LATTER MILITARY, BOTH PLAY COMPLEMENTARY ROLES IN THE SECURITY REALM AND SOME OF THEIR TASKS ARE SIMILAR. HOWEVER, THE LOCAL PERCEPTIONS OF EULEX AND KFOR REGARDING THEIR EXECUTION OF SECURITY-RELATED TASKS HAVE DIFFERED, WITH ONLY KFOR ENJOYING LOCAL ACCEPTANCE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE CAUSED BY THE MISSIONS' DIFFERENTLY PERCEIVED POWERS OVER LOCAL ACTORS, AS MANIFESTED THROUGH THEIR ABILITY TO EXERT COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION FROM LOCAL ACTORS THROUGH COERCION, THE ABILITY TO OFFER REWARDS AND LEGITIMACY. BY GOING BEYOND THE WELL-RESEARCHED INITIAL GRATITUDE OF KOSOVO ALBANIANS TO NATO/US FOR INTERVENING IN 1999, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A MORE FINE-GRAINED ANALYSIS OF KOSOVO ALBANIAN AND KOSOVO SERBIAN PERCEPTIONS OF EULEX AND KFOR.
819	KEY POINTS CONVENTION 108 IS THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL DATA PROTECTION TREATY. UPON ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE PROTOCOL MODERNIZING THE CONVENTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE, CONVENTION 108 WILL BECOME CONVENTION 108+ AND WILL GAIN THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A GLOBAL STANDARD-SETTER IN THE FIELD OF DATA PROTECTION. EVEN THOUGH CONVENTION 108 AND CONVENTION 108+ HAVE CLOSE TIES WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, CONVENTION 108+ CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS IN REGARD TO ADEQUACY ASSESSMENTS IN DIFFERENT NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS, AND HENCE VARYING POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING DATA TRANSFER AVENUES FOR BIOBANK RESEARCH. AN ADEQUACY DECISION IS NOT A DECISION ON THE ADEQUACY OF THE DATA PROTECTION REGIME STRICTO SENSU BUT, IN FACT, REQUIRES THE ADEQUACY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY TO BE IN PLACE AND ITS CAPABILITY TO UPHOLD THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY AS A KEY PILLAR OF A DEMOCRATIC LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE A DATA SUBJECT HAS ADEQUATE SECLUSION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO FROM THE STATE. IN ORDER TO ENABLE SUSTAINABLE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH, IN ADDITION TO RAISING THE DATA PROTECTION BAR AND STRENGTHENING BIOBANKING IN CAPE VERDE, MAURITIUS, MOROCCO, SENEGAL, AND TUNISIA, THE EFFORTS SHOULD GO FURTHER AND STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND RULE OF LAW.
820	THIS COMPARATIVE IDEOLOGICAL HISTORY CONSIDERS WHY INTERWAR AMERICA PRODUCED LESS PROMINENT THOUGHT THREATENING PARLIAMENTARISM AND THE RULE OF LAW THAN GERMANY. DESPITE DIFFERENT TRADITIONS, THINKERS IN PROGRESSIVE ERA AMERICA AND WEIMAR GERMANY SHARED TWO COMMITMENTS. BOTH SCORNED POLITICAL PARTIES AND YEARNED FOR NATIONAL UNITY. BOTH WERE ALSO HOSTILE TO THE RESTRAINTS OF LEGAL FORMALISM. BOTH EFFORTS TO DEPLOY UNBOUNDED STATES TO REALIZE UNITY FAILED, BUT DIFFERENTLY. PROGRESSIVISM'S ECLIPSE BY WORLD WAR I TEMPERED CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRATIC FULFILMENT AND EXPERTS' MORAL LEADERSHIP. BY CONTRAST, APPEALS IN POST-WAR WEIMAR TO NATIONAL UNITY AND THE RELIANCE ON STATE AUTHORITY - BOTH INTEGRAL TO THE SEARCH FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY - RADICALIZED AMIDST CRISIS THINKING. EXEMPLARY THINKERS CARL SCHMITT AND THURMAN ARNOLD AGREED THAT CRISIS DEMANDED TRANSFORMATIVE ACTION BASED ON UNIFYING MYTHS AND ADMINISTRATIONS LIBERATED FROM LEGAL RATIONALISM. ANTI-LIBERAL SCHMITT AIMED TO DESTROY POLITICAL HETEROGENEITY AND UNSHACKLE DECREE FROM STATUTORY LEGALITY. WRITING AFTER PROGRESSIVISM'S DISILLUSIONMENT, THE NEW DEALER ARNOLD SOUGHT TO USE MYTH TO CONCEAL ENDEMIC PLURALITY AND EMPLOY LAW'S OWN IRRATIONALITY TO DELIVER TO 'TECHNICIANS' THE DISCRETION NECESSARY FOR HAPHAZARD ECONOMIC EXPERIMENTATION. DIFFERENCE IN TIMING HELPED MAKE SIMILAR COMMITMENTS DEVELOP DIFFERENTLY IN INTERACTION WITH CRISIS THINKING, AND HELPS EXPLAIN ARNOLD'S IRRATIONALIST DEFENCE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
821	BRAZIL IS FACING ONE OF ITS MOST SEVERE POLITICAL CRISES SINCE 2016, WITH SEVERAL IMPACTS IN ITS GRADUAL PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE MAIN ARGUMENT IN THIS WORK IS THAT MANY OF THE GHOSTS THAT SCARY THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ARE DIRECT HEIRS OF AN UNRESOLVED (PRE-CONSTITUTIONAL) PAST, WHOSE RISKS CAN BE STRONGLY PERCEIVED AND WHOSE SOLUTION IS AN URGENT TASK. EVERY TIME THERE IS POLITICAL TURMOIL AND A DISTURBANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY, THE SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY SEEMS TO DWINDLE. IN THIS VEIN, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLORE SUCH CONTRADICTIONS AND DIFFICULTIES AND HOW THEY STILL REPRESENT A THREAT TO THE BRAZILIAN DEMOCRACY THROUGH AN ANALYSIS DEDICATED TO THE COMPLEX AND AMBIGUOUS RELATION THAT THE CONSTITUTION (AND VARIOUS OF THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTIONS, LIKE THE SUPREME COURT) HAS (HAVE) ESTABLISHED WITH THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THAT LASTED FROM 1964 UNTIL 1985. THE AUTHORITARIAN GHOSTS THAT UP UNTIL NOW HAUNTS THE BRAZILIAN REALITY, THOUGH INEVITABLE DUE TO THE COMPROMISES THAT UNDERPIN IT AND THE PRACTICES THAT STUBBORNLY REPLICATE THE PAST INTO THE VERY PRESENT, HAVE AT LEAST TO BE DISCLOSED AND, AS SUCH, CHALLENGED BY A LEARNING PROCESS THAT ONLY A MILITANT MEMORY IS CAPABLE OF MAKING US AWARE OF.
822	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TWO APPROACHES TO THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN THROUGH A THEORY OF CHANGE LENS. ONE, THE POLITICAL REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE LATE 1990S, WHICH PROMOTED THE PRINCIPLES OF PLURALISM, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THE RULE OF LAW VIA A TOP-DOWN AND INSIDE TRACK APPROACH. TWO, THE ONE MILLION SIGNATURES CAMPAIGN OF THE MID-2000S, WHICH CALLED FOR AN END TO ALL DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AGAINST WOMEN VIA A BOTTOM-UP AND OUTSIDE TRACK APPROACH. EXAMINING KEY FACTORS UNDERPINNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THEORY OF CHANGE, THE AUTHORS ANALYSE THE OBJECTIVES, STRATEGIES, TARGETS, CONSTRAINTS, AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT CHARACTERISED EACH INITIATIVE. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT BOTH INITIATIVES FAILED NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, BUT ALSO DUE TO INTERNAL STRATEGIC MISSTEPS. TWO IMPORTANT LESSONS EMERGE THAT MAY ASSIST IN GROUNDING FUTURE HUMAN RIGHTS EFFORTS IN IRAN IN MORE EFFECTIVE THEORIES OF CHANGE. ONE, PROMOTING ISLAMIC VALUES AND INTERESTS TO ADVANCE RIGHTS-BASED PRINCIPLES MUST BE COUPLED WITH ARGUMENTS GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE, RESEARCH, AND ANALYSIS. TWO, DRIVERS OF CHANGE IN IRAN MUST STOP WORKING IN TOP-DOWN/INSIDE AND BOTTOM-UP/OUTSIDE TRACK SILOS AND ESTABLISH AN ETHOS OF BEST-PRACTICE SHARING WHERE CONFRONTATION AND COOPERATION ARE TREATED AS MUTUALLY REINFORCING APPROACHES.
823	CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, WAR CRIMES AND GENOCIDE ARE INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO PROSECUTIONS BY INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. SHOULD THEN TERRORISM, AS A SUBSTANTIVE OFFENCE, BE EQUALLY PROSECUTED INTERNATIONALLY? OR IS IT A DIFFERENT KIND OF 'ANIMAL'? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT TERRORISM DOES NOT BELONG WITHIN THE REALM OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW. ON THE SURFACE, IT IS THE LACK OF INTERNATIONALLY AGREED DEFINITION OF TERRORISM AND ITS DOMESTIC LAW ORIGINS THAT SET IT APART FROM THE NOTIONS OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, WAR CRIMES AND GENOCIDE. THESE CRIMES, IN CONTRAST WITH TERRORISM, ARE ROOTED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND DENOTE CONSENSUS WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE ACTS IT HAS NOT TOLERATED SINCE THE TIME OF NUREMBERG AND TOKYO PROCESSES. DIGGING JUST A LITTLE DEEPER, THE DIVERGENCE, WHICH IS BEST EXPLAINED USING THE LANGUAGE OF CRIMINOLOGY, STEMS FROM THE POLITICAL NATURE OF THE WAR ON TERROR. THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IS A RESPONSE TO PUBLIC DEMAND FOR MORE SECURITY. CONSEQUENTLY, TERRORISM IS A POLICY OFFENCE UTILIZED BY STATES IN PURSUIT OF BROADER GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES. INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW IS NOT A SUITABLE MECHANISM FOR SATISFYING THE NEED FOR MORE SECURITY BECAUSE ITS MAIN GOAL IS SYMBOLIC AND LIES ELSEWHERE IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND FIGHTING THE CULTURE OF IMPUNITY.
824	A LARGE BODY OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT POLICIES BASED SOLELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS INCREASE THE HEALTH RISKS OF PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS (PWIDS) AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. ALTHOUGH FORMAL LAWS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTING HARM REDUCTION, IT IS THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW THAT AFFECTS PWIDS' BEHAVIOR AND ATTITUDES MOST ACUTELY. THIS COMMENTARY FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON DRUG POLICIES AND POLICING PRACTICES THAT INCREASE PWIDS' RISK OF ACQUIRING HIV AND VIRAL HEPATITIS, AND AVENUES FOR INTERVENTION. POLICY AND LEGAL REFORMS THAT PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH OVER THE CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUG USE AND PWID ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR ILLICIT DRUG POSSESSION AND USE. CHANGING LEGAL NORMS AND IMPROVING LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES TO DRUG-RELATED HARMS REQUIRES PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE BROADER THAN THE NECESSARY BRIDGES BETWEEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC HEALTH SECTORS. HIV PREVENTION EFFORTS MUST PARTNER WITH WIDER INITIATIVES THAT SEEK TO IMPROVE POLICE PROFESSIONALISM, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TRANSPARENCY AND BOOST THE RULE OF LAW. PUBLIC HEALTH AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS CAN WORK SYNERGISTICALLY TO SHIFT THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AWAY FROM ONE THAT EXACERBATES HIV RISKS TO ONE THAT PROMOTES SAFE AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES.

825	WHILE A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL REFORM IN NEW DEMOCRACIES, FEW SCHOLARS HAVE EXAMINED THE REFORM OF MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN THESE SETTINGSDESPITE THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE COURTS TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH CIVILIAN COURTS AND SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON LATIN AMERICA TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE HOW THE PROCESS OF REFORMING MILITARY COURTS HAS PLAYED OUT IN EACH DEMOCRACY FOLLOWING AUTHORITARIAN RULE. WE OUTLINE TWO DISTINCT PATHWAYS: (1) UNILATERAL EFFORTS ON THE PART OF CIVILIAN REFORMERS, AND (2) STRATEGIC BARGAINS BETWEEN CIVILIAN REFORMERS AND THE MILITARY. WITHIN THE UNILATERAL CATEGORY, WE FURTHER DISTINGUISH EFFORTS DRIVEN BY CIVILIAN COURTS, THOSE PURSUED BY POLITICIANS, AND THOSE UNDERTAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF LARGER POLITICAL TRANSFORMATIONS. ULTIMATELY, WE FIND THAT, ABSENT A DRAMATIC DEFEAT OF AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME AND ITS ARMED FORCES, REFORM EFFORTS THAT DO NOT ENGAGE AND BARGAIN WITH THE MILITARY DIRECTLY OFTEN FAIL TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM COMPLIANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES. THE SUCCESS OF SUCH REFORM EFFORTS, THEREFORE, MAY COME AT A COST IN OTHER AREAS OF DEMOCRACY AND CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS. WE CONCLUDE THE ARTICLE BY SUMMARIZING OUR FINDINGS AND REFLECTING ON THE LESSONS THEY PROVIDE FOR ONGOING MILITARY JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS AROUND THE GLOBE.
826	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE REFORM PROCESS SURROUNDING THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE MALAYSIAN CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CONCERNING STATEMENTS MADE TO POLICE OFFICERS, DISCOVERY, BODY SEARCHES, RIGHTS TO LEGAL ADVICE AND DETENTION. THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (AMENDMENT) ACT 2006 WAS THE FIRST MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL PROCESS IN MALAYSIA FOR 20 YEARS AND REPRESENTED AN ATTEMPT NOT ONLY TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS RELATING TO POLICE PRACTICE AND THE PRE-TRIAL PROCESS, BUT ALSO TO SINGLE OUT MALAYSIA AS A PROGRESSIVE STATE WITHIN ASIA COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE PROBLEM WHICH THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS, HOWEVER, IS THAT WHILE MANY OF THE REFORMS APPEAR TO BE A WELCOME ATTEMPT TO PROTECT SUSPECTS IN POLICE CUSTODY FROM ABUSE (A STARTLING CONTRAST TO THE RECENT LEGISLATIVE MEASURES INTRODUCED IN THE UK AS PART OF THE "WAR ON TERROR"), TO BETTER REGULATE POLICE INVESTIGATIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF JUSTICE ADMINISTERED PRE-TRIAL, A DOUBT LINGERS AS TO THE DIRECTION OF THAT REFORM AND OF THE VALUES GUIDING THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT, WITHOUT CLEAR CULTURAL MARKERS, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MEASURES IS LIKELY TO BE PIECEMEAL AND PREVIOUS CULTURAL PRACTICES WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE EVEN THE BEST OF LEGISLATIVE INTENTIONS.
827	PLATO'S VOICE OF REASON LIES AT THE HEART OF THE WESTERN TRADITION. HIS ETHICAL TEACHING, FOUNDED ON THE CARDINAL VIRTUES OF JUSTICE, TEMPERANCE, WISDOM AND COURAGE, IS OF UNIVERSAL AND UNCHANGING VALIDITY, FOR IT TRANSCENDS ALL DIFFERENCES OF TIME, PLACE, RELIGION, ETHNIC ORIGIN, POLITICAL PERSUASION AND THE LIKE. OF THESE FOUR VIRTUES, THE ONE MOST EASILY OVERLOOKED IS TEMPERANCE. PLATO'S NOTION OF TEMPERANCE, AS ELABORATED IN HIS DIALOGUES THE LAWS AND THE REPUBLIC, IS FAR REMOVED FROM CONVENTIONAL MODERN IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT: IT'S MANIFOLD MEANINGS INCLUDE RESTRAINT, ORDER, MODERATION, EQUILIBRIUM, HARMONY, MEASURE, SELF-CONTROL AND BALANCE. TEMPERANCE IN ONE OR OTHER OF THESE GUISES, HAS A VITAL PART TO PLAY IN GOVERNMENT: THE RULE OF LAW, THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS ARE ALL DEMONSTRABLY PLATONIC IN ORIGIN. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE OPERATION OF PLATONIC TEMPERANCE IN MODERN BUSINESS. THROUGH THE USE OF EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES, THIS PAPER STUDIES BOTH AFFIRMATIONS AND VIOLATIONS OF TEMPERANCE IN BUSINESS PRACTICE, ANCIENT AS WELL AS MODERN. THE AIM IS TO SHOW THAT PLATONIC TEMPERANCE IS CAPABLE OF HEALING THE MISTRUST AND RESENTMENT THAT TOO OFTEN CLOUD THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN A BUSINESS, ITS EMPLOYEES, ITS CUSTOMERS AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE.
828	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE TRANSFORMATION IN CONTEMPORARY PEACEBUILDING PRACTICE THAT IS CARRIED OUT AND SUPPORTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE PEACEBUILDING MODELS REALIZED TO DATE REFLECT THE 'LIBERAL PEACE' METHOD PRACTICALLY AND CONCEPTUALLY. THE LIBERAL PEACE METHOD INCLUDES STEPS TOWARDS THE RESTORATION OR RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF A POLITICAL COMMUNITY AFTER VIOLENT CONFLICT. HOWEVER, THE NEED TO REBUILD ISN'T ONLY AT THE LEVEL OF STATE INSTITUTIONS; IT'D ALSO CONCERN ALL AREAS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATIONS, ESPECIALLY THE LEVEL OF PEOPLE'S DAILY LIFE. THE LIBERAL PEACE METHOD INCLUDES DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, ETC. SYSTEMS HAVE FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND INSTITUTIONALIZE SUSTAINABLE PEACE, AS SEEN IN HAITI, BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, AFGHANISTAN, AND OTHER POST-WAR STATES. FOR THIS REASON, IT'S ARGUED IN THE STUDY THAT PEACE (AND SECURITY, DEVELOPMENT, RESTRUCTURING) IN SOCIETIES EMERGING FROM WAR DEPENDS ON THE 'HYBRIDITY' BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND THE LOCAL. IN THE STUDY, IT'S SHOWN THROUGH THE UN'S EAST TIMOR INTERVENTION THAT PEACEBUILDING CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LIBERAL AND THE LOCAL. THEREFORE, IT'S ARGUED IN THE STUDY THAT THE 'HYBRID PEACE' APPROACH CAN PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION AS IT REPRESENTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL NORMS, INTERESTS, LOCAL PARTICIPATION, AND IDENTITY.
829	THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE DETERMINANTS OF FISCAL SPACE WITHIN THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) REGION, UTILISING A PANEL OF 33 COUNTRIES FROM 2005 TO 2021. THE PAPER APPLIED THE PANEL THRESHOLD, DIFFERENCE, AND SYSTEM GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) REGRESSION TECHNIQUES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS FOUND EVIDENCE OF CONSTRAINED FISCAL SPACE AND POOR GOVERNANCE IN CENTRAL, WESTERN, AND EASTERN AFRICA. THE RESULTS FURTHER UNVEILED THAT AN ENHANCEMENT IN GOVERNANCE INDICATORS BEYOND -0.23 FOR THE GOVERNANCE INDEX, -0.15 FOR CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, -0.98 FOR THE RULE OF LAW, -0.37 FOR REGULATORY QUALITY, -0.15 FOR VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, +0.36 FOR POLITICAL STABILITY, AND -0.61 FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RESPECTIVELY, INCREASE FISCAL SPACE. MOREOVER, THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE OUTPUT GAP, COVID-19, TRADE OPENNESS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IMPACT FISCAL SPACE AVAILABILITY IN CENTRAL, WESTERN, SOUTHERN, AND EASTERN AFRICA. THE PAPER INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND GOVERNANCE QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED FISCAL SPACE WITHIN SSA. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND ENHANCEMENT IN ALL FACETS OF GOVERNANCE THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNANCE POLICIES ACROSS ALL SSA COUNTRIES. ANOTHER KEY RECOMMENDATION IS FOSTERING TRADE OPENNESS TO EXPAND TAX REVENUE GENERATION AND BROADEN THE TAX BASE, THEREBY PROVIDING THE CONTINENT WITH GREATER FISCAL SPACE AND IMPROVED RESILIENCE TO UNFORESEEN SHOCKS.
830	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DISCUSS UNIVERSITY EXTENSION IN LAW COURSES IN THE LIGHT OF THE INSEPARABILITY OF THE TEACHING/RESEARCH/EXTENSION GUARANTEED IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1988 AND THE NATIONAL COURSE CURRICULUM GUIDELINES OF LAW GRADUATION STIPULATED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION (CNE), WHICH DETERMINES THESE COURSES SHOULD MANDATORILY EXPLORE FORMS OF TRANSVERSAL APPROACHES OF CONTENTS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION, ELDERLY, HUMAN RIGHTS, GENDER POLICY, ETC. MUCH MORE THAN FORMAL REQUIREMENTS, THIS IS ABOUT CONNECTING THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE GENERATED IN LAW COURSES WITH THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY REALITY EXPERIENCED BY THE STUDENT. THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTANCES AND THE INDIVIDUAL GUARANTEES. THE RESEARCH, REGARDING THE TYPE, USES THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, OF QUALITATIVE CHARACTER, WITH EXPLORATORY NATURE, HAVING AS A CHARACTERISTIC THE DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL STUDY WITH DEDUCTIVE REASONING. BUT HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF CITIZEN FORMATION OF THE FUTURE PROFESSIONAL OF LAW THAT DID NOT TAKE IN ITS FORMATIVE PROCESS THE KNOWLEDGE SEIZED TO OTHERS, ESPECIALLY MINORITIES? THUS, THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT THE THEME IS OF GREAT ACADEMIC RELEVANCE, GIVEN THAT KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED IN LAW COURSES MUST NECESSARILY BE TAKEN TO THE COMMUNITY, STIMULATING OTHER PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND FULFILL THEIR DUTIES.
831	CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE HAS DEEP ROOTS IN CANADIAN HISTORY. FOCUSING ON THE PERIOD FROM 1960 UNTIL QUEBEC'S "MAPLE SPRING" PROTESTS OF 2012, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PRACTICE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BY A DIVERSITY OF DISSENTING INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IN CANADA. CONSIDERED COLLECTIVELY, THE EXAMPLES OF PEACE, ANTI-NUCLEAR, AND CIVIL RIGHTS PROTESTS; DEFENCE OF ENGLISH-LANGUAGE MINORITY RIGHTS IN QUEBEC; CORPORATE RESISTANCE TO SUNDAY SHOPPING RESTRICTIONS IN ONTARIO; PRO- AND ANTI-ABORTION ADVOCACY; AND THE OFTEN OVERLAPPING ACTIVISM OF INDIGENOUS AND ENVIRONMENTALIST GROUPS ILLUSTRATE HOW CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ENDEAVOURED TO INFLUENCE, WHETHER BY CONVERSION OR COERCION, PUBLIC OPINION ON SOME OF CANADIAN SOCIETY'S MOST COMPLEX AND DIVISIVE ISSUES. IN DEFINING CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT NON-VIOLENCE IS AN ESSENTIAL DESCRIPTOR. SOME OBSERVERS CONTINUED TO EXPRESS CONCERNS WELL INTO THE 1990S THAT GROWING INSTANCES OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE DID NOT BODE WELL FOR CANADIAN SOCIAL ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW. BUT AS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BECAME INCREASINGLY NORMALIZED, PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN 1982, AND WIDESPREAD SOCIAL DISORDER DID NOT ENSUE, NON-VIOLENT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ALIGNED WITH A NATIONAL POLITICAL CULTURE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEFERENCE AND COMPROMISE. CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE HAD BECOME "AS CANADIAN AS MAPLE SYRUP."
832	THE STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF REGIONAL FINANCIAL INTEGRATION ON BANKING SECTOR DEVELOPMENT WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PROTOCOLS ON TRADE AND FINANCE AND INVESTMENT. A TOTAL OF 14 COUNTRIES MADE UP THE STUDY SAMPLE, AND THE PANEL COINTEGRATION FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES MODEL (FMOLS) ALONGSIDE THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE NATURE OF THE IMPACT. STUDY FINDINGS SHOWED THAT REGIONAL INTEGRATION THROUGH THE PROTOCOL ON TRADE HAD A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SIZE AND EFFICIENCY OF THE BANKING SECTOR USING THE FMOLS ESTIMATOR. GMM ESTIMATIONS FOR THE SAME VARIABLES WERE LARGELY INSIGNIFICANT. STUDY FINDINGS ALSO POINTED TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL INTEGRATION INDICATORS AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE PROTOCOL, WHICH IN TURN ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF MONETIZATION OF REGIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE FINANCE AND INVESTMENT PROTOCOL HAD A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PRIVATE SECTOR CREDIT FOR BOTH ESTIMATORS AND LARGELY INSIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH BROAD MONEY. THE STUDY ALSO OBSERVED THE COMPLIMENTARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND SOCIAL CAPITAL IN THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICIES THAT STRENGTHEN SOUND LEGAL SYSTEMS, PROTECT PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW.
833	WITH THE VICTORY OF HASSON ROUHANI IN THE 2013 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, A TREND IN IRAN'S POLITICAL SPHERE COME TO HEGEMONY, CALLING ITSELF A DISCOURSE OF MODERATION AND ADVOCATING A NEW PARADIGM FOR IRANIAN DEVELOPMENT. THE PRESENT STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERST AND THE DISCOURSE OF MODERATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE MODEL OF THIS DISCOURSE ON IRANIAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE FORM OF LACLAU AND MOUFFE'S THEORY. THE MAINQUESTION OF THE RESEARCH IS WHAT IS THE PATTERN OF THIS DISCOURSE ON DEVELOPMENT IN IRAN? THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DISCOURSE OF MODERATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF IRAN HAS PLACED 'LIBERALMODERNIZATION" AT THE CENTER OF ITS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF "IGEO-KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS, PRIVATIZATION,"RATIONALHY", "FREEDOM", "CONSTRUCTTVE IMERACTIORR,SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS "," MODERATION AND AVOIDANCE OF EXTREMISM "," DEVELOPMENTAL FOREIGN POLICY UNITY AND SOLIDARITY- THE RULE OF LAW "AND" MINIMALIST STATE "AS THE FLOATING SIGNS OF ITS DISCOURSE AND TO MAKE ITS DISCOURSE OPERATIONAL, IT HAS TAKEN MEASURES SUCH AS DE-ESCALATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, DIRECT NEGOTIATION WITH THE US IN THE FORM OF A DETERRENCE STRATEGY, EXPANDING NEIGHBOR RELATIONS, AND AND INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS, COOPERATION WITH REGIONAL AND INTEMOTIONOL ORGANIZATIONS TO COMBAT ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND VIOLENCE HAS. THE DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL RESEARCH METHOD AND DATA WERE COLLECTED USING LIBRARY CHECKING.
834	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE STUDY THE CONTAGION EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENTS ISSUED BY FOREIGN FIRMS TRADED IN THE UNITED STATES. SPECIFICALLY, WE PREDICT AND FIND THAT ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENTS THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SHARE PRICES OF THE RESTATING FOREIGN FIRMS RAISE INVESTOR CONCERNS THAT NONRESTATING FOREIGN FIRMS FROM THE SAME HOME COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR ACCOUNTING ISSUES, AND THEREFORE INDUCE A NEGATIVE STOCK MARKET REACTION TO NONRESTATING HOME COUNTRY PEER FIRMS. WE REFER TO THIS AS A RESTATEMENT-INDUCED HOME COUNTRY CONTAGION EFFECT. ON AVERAGE, NONRESTATING HOME COUNTRY PEER FIRMS EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE STOCK MARKET RETURN OF APPROXIMATELY -0.69% OVER A 3-DAY WINDOW AROUND THE RESTATEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT. MOREOVER, WE HYPOTHESIZE AND SHOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE HOME MARKET RULE OF LAW (ROL) AFFECTS INVESTOR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEER FIRMS HAVE SIMILAR ACCOUNTING ISSUES, AND THEREFORE AFFECTS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CONTAGION. SPECIFICALLY, NONRESTATING HOME COUNTRY PEER FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH WEAK ROL EXPERIENCE AN AVERAGE STOCK PRICE DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY -1.32%, WHEREAS PEER FIRMS FROM STRONG ROL COUNTRIES EXPERIENCE AN AVERAGE NEGATIVE RETURN OF ONLY -0.26% OVER THE 3-DAY WINDOW AROUND THE RESTATEMENT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RESTATEMENTS FILED BY WEAK ROL FIRMS ARE PERCEIVED TO BE MORE "CONTAGIOUS" THAN THOSE FILED BY STRONG ROL FIRMS.
835	THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ('EU') SOFT POWER RESOURCES AND UNDERPINNING CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES (INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, SOLIDARITY, EQUALITY, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS) HAVE HISTORICALLY EXERTED A MAGNETIC ATTRACTION, OFFERING DISTINCT OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IF THE EU REGIME AND LEGAL ORDER HAVE INDUCED PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE UNTIL NOW IT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE CONSIDERED THAT IT SERVES THEIR INTERESTS MOST OF THE TIME. HOWEVER, THROUGH A SERIES OF CRISES FROM THE EUROZONE CRISIS TO THE MIGRATION CRISIS AND NOW BREXIT, THE EU HAS ENDURED GROWING PARTY-BASED EUROSCEPTICISM AND A CHANGING PERCEPTION OF ITS VALUE FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT. THIS CRISIS NARRATIVE IS IMPACTING NEGATIVELY UPON THE EU'S CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT, WHILE ALSO SHRINKING ITS SOFT POWER RESOURCES. THE FUTURE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION ('EI') AND OF EUROPEAN INFLUENCE DEPENDS NOT ONLY UPON THE EU'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN LEGITIMACY AS A PRODUCER OF PUBLIC GOODS BUT ALSO ON ITS ABILITY TO INVOKE ACCEPTANCE OF ITS LEGAL ORDER OR REGIME AND TO SUSTAIN AN ALLURING NARRATIVE OF EXPANSION, INFLUENCE AND SUCCESS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EU'S NORMATIVE POWER AND ITS CAPACITY TO ACT IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE ARE SHAPED BY ITS MEASURABLE ACHIEVEMENTS AND ITS SOFT POWER RESOURCES.
836	WE INVESTIGATE CORPORATE DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE IN THE MENA REGION AND ITS FIRM AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS USING A SAMPLE OF 444 LISTED FIRMS OVER THE 2003-2011 PERIOD, OR 3717 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS. WE FIND A VERY LIMITED USE OF LONG-TERM DEBT BY MENA FIRMS; LONG-TERM DEBT REPRESENTS ONLY 3.41% OF THE TYPICAL MENA FIRM'S TOTAL DEBT, WHICH IS MUCH LESS THAN WHAT IS REPORTED IN PRIOR LITERATURE ON OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF DEBT MATURITY THEORIES AND PRIOR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS, WE FIND THAT LEVERAGE, FIRM SIZE, AND ASSET TANGIBILITY ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF MORE LONG-TERM DEBT WHILE FIRMS FACING A HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT TEND TO USE MORE SHORT-TERM DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT BETTER QUALITY INSTITUTIONS LEAD TO THE USE OF MORE LONG-TERM DEBT IN MENA. SPECIFICALLY, STRONGER RULE OF LAW, BETTER REGULATORY EFFECTIVENESS, BETTER LEGAL PROTECTION OF CREDITORS, AND MORE DEVELOPED FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER USE OF LONG-TERM BORROWING BY MENA FIRMS. OUR FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS AS THEY ILLUMINATE THE PATH TOWARD NEEDED REFORMS THAT WOULD ENHANCE MENA FIRMS' ACCESS TO LONG-TERM DEBT, WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN MORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND JOBS.

837	IN COMPARING PUBLICS' IDEOLOGICAL SELF-PLACEMENTS BETWEEN ESTABLISHED AND NEW DEMOCRACIES, IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A HIGHER PROPORTION OF CITIZENS WHO EXPRESS RADICAL VIEWS IN THE LATTER COUNTRIES. THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO SHARP DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO EVALUATIONS OF PAST AUTHORITARIAN RULE, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NEW REGIME, OR NEW INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS GOVERNING THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER WHEN COUNTRIES EMBARK ON DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. STUDIES ON THE ATTITUDINAL ASPECT OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION LEAD ONE TO EXPECT A DECREASE IN EXTREME VIEWS IN NEW DEMOCRACIES WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, AS QUESTIONS OF REGIME PRINCIPLES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE SETTLED, AND CITIZENS COME TO ACCEPT DEMOCRACY AS THE "ONLY GAME IN TOWN". THE PRESENT ARTICLE INVESTIGATES WHETHER THIS PROPOSITION IS APPLICABLE TO "THIRD WAVE" NEW DEMOCRACIES IN EASTERN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND EAST ASIA BY EXAMINING LONGITUDINAL PUBLIC OPINION DATA FROM 23 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO THE LENGTH OF DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, WE ALSO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, AND ELECTORAL SYSTEMS ON THE PROPORTION OF RADICAL CITIZENS. RESULTS SHOW THAT WHILE LONGER DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE DOES CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING EXTREMIST LEANINGS, FACTORS SUCH AS THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, AND PLURALITY ELECTORAL RULES PLAY A MORE SUBSTANTIVE ROLE.
838	BACKGROUND: FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AMONG THE WORKING POPULATION, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT CONFIDENCE IN THE WELFARE SYSTEM IS HIGH, ENSURING THE CITIZENS ECONOMIC SECURITY AND PROTECTING THEM FROM ECONOMIC STRESS WHEN FALLING ILL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW PEOPLE WITH EXPERIENCE OF HEALTH INSURANCE PERCEIVE THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE SWEDISH SOCIAL INSURANCE AGENCY (SSIA). METHODS: EIGHT FOCUS GROUPS (N = 41) WERE CONDUCTED AND EACH GROUP MET ON ONE OCCASION. RESULTS: THE PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED A SYSTEMIC CHANGE IN THE WORK OF THE SSIA WHERE THE RULE-OF-LAW WAS DISREGARDED, WITH ARBITRARY ASSESSMENT, AND NO TRANSPARENCY. THE RECEPTION BY THE SSIA SHAPED THE IMAGE OF THE SSIA. THE PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED VULNERABILITY IN RELATION TO THE SSIA. THEY FELT MISTRUSTED, WHICH LEFT A FEELING OF IMPOTENCE THAT WORSENED THEIR HEALTH. EXPERIENCING VULNERABILITY LEFT A STRONG IMPRESSION AND AFFECTED THE PARTICIPANTS' CONFIDENCE NEGATIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: THE FOLLOWING HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO PREVENT CLIENTS FROM EXPERIENCING IMPAIRED HEALTH, PROMOTE RETURN-TO-WORK POSSIBILITIES, AND TO PUSH PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE INSTITUTION IN A MORE POSITIVE DIRECTION: POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS NEED TO CLARIFY THE REGULATIONS. THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT AND JUST. THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE, INCLUDING CONTINUITY AS WELL AS A PERSONAL, NICE RECEPTION, HAS TO BE ENSURED.
839	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE STATE POLICE IN MOZAMBIQUE TRIED TO (RE)ENCROACH UPON A FORMER WAR ZONE AND WHAT THEIR METHODS IMPLIED FOR STATE AUTHORITY MORE GENERALLY. POST-WAR REFORM EFFORTS TO PROFESSIONALIZE THE POLICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE HAD APPARENTLY PARADOXICAL RESULTS. THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE EFFORTS TO CONSTITUTE STATE AUTHORITY HAVE RELIED ON BOTH EMBRACING AND TAMING 'TRADITION' AS AN ALTERNATIVE DOMAIN OF AUTHORITY, ORDER AND LAW. ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK AT POLICE STATIONS SHOWS THAT THE POLICE INCREASINGLY HANDLE WITCHCRAFT CASES AND SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS. THIS, THE ARTICLE ARGUES, DOES NOT ONLY REFLECT A TENSION BETWEEN LOCAL/CUSTOMARY AND STATE/LEGAL NOTIONS OF ORDER AND JUSTICE. EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT IS THE EXISTENCE OF PARTIAL SOVEREIGNTIES. A SPIRITUAL IDIOM OF POWER AND EVILDOING CONSTITUTES AN ALTERNATIVE ARTICULATION OF SOVEREIGNTY DUE TO THE CAPACITY OF INVISIBLE FORCES TO GIVE AND TAKE LIFE. THIS IS AN IDIOM MASTERED BY CHIEFS AND HEALERS. POLICE OFFICERS ENGAGE WITH INVISIBLE FORCES TO GAIN POPULAR LEGITIMACY AND MANIFEST STATE POWER, AND YET THEY NEVER MANAGE TO FULLY MASTER THOSE FORCES. CONSEQUENTLY, STATE POLICE AUTHORITY REMAINS UNCERTAIN, AND MUST BE CONTINUALLY REINFORCED BY ENACTING HIERARCHIES AND JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES AND BY USING FORCE.
840	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES REGIONAL AUTONOMY IN CHINA'S ETHNIC MINORITY AREAS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR MINORITY RIGHTS IN CHINA. IT ARGUES THAT CHINA'S REGIONAL AUTONOMY REGIME IS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT IN QUEST FOR NATIONAL UNITY, SOCIAL HARMONY AND EQUALITY AMONG ETHNIC GROUPS IN CHINA. IN LIGHT OF PAST STATE-MINORITY RELATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGING CONDITIONS IN CHINA, AND BY REFERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE, THE ARTICLE OFFERS SUGGESTIONS FOR CHINA TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT MINORITY RIGHTS LEGISLATION AND POLICIES. IT ARGUES THAT, UNDER THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM IN VIEW OF THE EXISTING BASIC FRAMEWORK ON MINORITIES, THE CHINESE STATE SHOULD ADOPT A NEW APPROACH WHICH ENCOMPASSES ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW, DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. THE NEW APPROACH SHOULD GUARANTEE RESPECT FOR MINORITY IDENTITIES AND SEEK MEANS OF ESTABLISHING THEIR RESPECTIVE AUTONOMIES AND REALIZING THEIR SPECIAL RIGHTS. IT SHOULD FOCUS AS MUCH ON THE PROCESS AS ON THE DECISIONS, ON THE VOICES AS ON THE RESULTS AND ON THE INDIVIDUALS AS ON THE GROUPS. IN THIS WAY, CHINA'S NATIONAL REGIONAL AUTONOMY WOULD BE ORIENTED TOWARDS A COMPLETE POLICY OF COMMITMENT TO PLURALISTIC VALUES WITHIN THE CHINESE POLITY AND WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO SATISFY THE MINORITY ASPIRATIONS AND THE STATE'S NEED FOR NATIONAL STABILITY AND UNITY.
841	SINCE THE 1980S, STATES HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY ADDRESSING PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS USING MULTIPLE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS. IN THE MID 1980S, SCHOLARS OF TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY GENERALLY CONCLUDED THAT TRIALS FOR PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WERE POLITICALLY UNTENABLE AND LIKELY TO UNDERMINE NEW DEMOCRACIES. MORE RECENTLY, SOME INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS EXPERTS HAVE ECHOED THE PESSIMISTIC CLAIMS OF THE EARLY "TRIAL SKEPTICS" AND ADDED NEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRIALS. YET RELATIVELY LITTLE MULTI COUNTRY EMPIRICAL WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO TEST SUCH CLAIMS, IN PART BECAUSE NO DATABASE ON TRIALS WAS AVAILABLE. WE HAVE CREATED A NEW DATA SET OF TWO MAIN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS: TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND TRIALS FOR PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WITH THE NEW DATA, WE DOCUMENT THE EMERGENCE AND DRAMATIC GROWTH OF THE USE OF TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND DOMESTIC, FOREIGN, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS IN THE WORLD. WE THEN EXPLORE THE IMPACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS HAVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, CONFLICT, DEMOCRACY, AND RULE OF LAW IN LATIN AMERICA. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PESSIMISTIC CLAIMS OF SKEPTICS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS THREATEN DEMOCRACY, INCREASE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND EXACERBATE CONFLICT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM LATIN AMERICA.
842	THIS ARTICLE CONFRONTS PRESENT MAIN STREAM PLANNING APPROACHES AGAINST THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY, AS RELEVANT FOR RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES AND BASED ON A MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW APPROACH. IT DISCUSSES THE SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AGAINST THE GENERAL EXPERIENCE OF MASSIVE IMPLEMENTATION DEFICITS REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. IN THIS CONFRONTATION, ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING, WITH AT LEAST SOME PRINCIPLES PICKED UP FROM NEW ZEALAND'S RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT, AND MUCH MORE TAKEN FROM MODERN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW THEORY ON LEGAL OPERATIONALISATION, IS COMPARED TO ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACHES WHICH ALSO ALLOW FOR MODIFYING THE ENVIRONMENT RELATED GOAL IF IMPLEMENTATION FAILS OR SEEMS VERY DIFFICULT. THE CONCEPT OF ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING (AEP) IS SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE ROAD TO CHOOSE FOR PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY, WHILE MAXIMIZING DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK LEGALLY DEFINED BY MEANS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS FIVE CRITERIA, ALL OF WHICH MUST BE MET BY AEP PLANNING. ONE OF THESE RELATES TO A PLANNING HIERARCHY WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT COASTAL PLANNING, IF IT IS INTENDED TO AIM AT SUSTAINABILITY, CAN NOT BE DEALT WITH IN ISOLATION, ALTHOUGH SUCH PLANNING MIGHT HAVE TO MEET VERY COMPLEX PROBLEMS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL.
843	AQUATIC PRODUCTS FULFILL THE PROTEIN NEEDS OF PEOPLE AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FOOD SAFETY. AND AQUACULTURE IS PRIZED FOR ITS HIGH PRODUCTIVITY, SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLINESS. CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF AQUACULTURE, THE LEGAL RISKS EXPOSED DURING THE AQUACULTURE PROCESS DESERVE ATTENTION IN ORDER TO PREVENT THEM FROM HINDERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY. THROUGH ONLINE RESEARCH, LITERATURE ANALYSIS AND PRACTICAL COMMUNICATION, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL RISKS WITH COMMONALITIES INCLUDE LAND USE VIOLATIONS, LACK OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS, FAILURE TO MEET TAILING WATER CRITERIA, UNQUARANTINED FRY AND MISUSE OF PROHIBITED AGRICULTURAL PHARMACEUTICALS THROUGH ONLINE RESEARCH, LITERATURE ANALYSIS AND PRACTICAL COMMUNICATION. BY ANALYZING THE REASONS FOR THE FORMATION OF LEGAL RISKS AND COMBINING THE EXPERIENCES IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THREE MAJOR AQUACULTURE COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE KOREA, NORWAY AND CHILE, THIS PAPER PROVIDES TARGETED PREVENTIVE REMEDIES AND SUGGESTIONS FOR AQUACULTURE OPERATORS, ADMINISTRATIVE PARTIES, LEGISLATORS AND OTHER PARTIES ON LEGAL RISKS. IT INCLUDES PROMOTING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MULTIPLE ASPECTS, CLARIFYING THE POSITIONING OF THE AQUATIC BREEDING CERTIFICATES, IMPROVING AND PROPAGATING THE STANDARDS FOR WASTEWATER DISCHARGE, INCREASING THE SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE OF AQUATIC FRY AND FINGERLINGS, AS WELL AS MAKING USE OF THE SYNERGY OF SOFT LAW AND HARD LAW.
844	EXISTING STUDIES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED, CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AND RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT (RE) NEXUS AND THE GOVERNANCE QUALITY-RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, THE STUDY REGARDING THE MODERATION OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON THE FDI-RENEWABLE ENERGY NEXUS IS QUITE SCARCE. TO FILL THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE, THE STUDY THEREFORE EXAMINES THE MODERATION OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON THE INFLUENCE OF FDI ON RE IN 37 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN ECONOMIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2020. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE PANEL CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS (PCSE) ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE HAS BEEN ADOPTED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FDI HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON RE, MEANING THAT AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT COULD LEAD TO A 0.05 INCREASE IN RE. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS UNVEIL THAT GOVERNANCE QUALITY IS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH RE. THIS MEANS THAT AN UNIT INCREASE IN CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY LEADS TO A 9.64, 9.10, 10.10 AND 9.08 INCREASE UNIT IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR, RESPECTIVELY. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN FDI AND GOVERNANCE QUALITY HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON RE. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED BASED ON THE FINDINGS REVEALED BY THIS STUDY.
845	SPYWARE HAS BEEN HERALDED AS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, EXAMPLES ABOUND OF STATES THAT USE IT IN A MANNER THAT VIOLATES HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS UNDERMINES DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DUAL-USE REGULATION WAS RECAST IN 2021. IT NOW MAKES AN EFFORT TO CONTROL THE EXPORT OF CYBER SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING SPYWARE, WHICH IT DEFINES AS DUAL USE. WHAT NARRATIVE IS CREATED BY FRAMING SPYWARE AS 'DUAL USE'? THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HOW THE TERM 'DUAL USE' ROOTS IN A DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'PEACEFUL' AND 'NON-PEACEFUL', OR 'CIVIL' AND 'MILITARY' USES, AND HAS GRADUALLY BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH A BROADER DICHOTOMY BETWEEN 'LEGITIMATE' AND 'ILLEGITIMATE' PURPOSES. HISTORICALLY, THIS DUALITY SERVED NOT ONLY TO ARTICULATE THE RISKS POSED BY CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND INDICATE THE RATIONALE FOR THEIR EXPORT CONTROL BUT ALSO TO JUSTIFY THEIR TRADE. YET RECOURSE BY EU ACTORS TO DUAL USE TILTS THE EU DISCOURSE ON SPYWARE EXPORT CONTROL TOWARDS STATE-CENTRIC SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS AND COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS. UNMASKING HOW THE TERM TRANSPOSES A CONCEPTUALLY FLAWED, DECEPTIVE AND EMPTY DUALITY TO THE SPYWARE CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE VERY CONCEPT OF DUAL USE MAY UNDERMINE HUMAN RIGHTS SAFEGUARDS IN SPYWARE EXPORT CONTROL.
846	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE VALUE ORIENTATIONS OF THE YOUTH IN THE REGIONS OF THE SOUTH RUSSIA IN THE CONTEXT OF LIFE GOALS, METHODS AND CONDITIONS FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THE HIERARCHY OF YOUNG PEOPLE'S VALUE PRIORITIES (LIFE GOALS) IS HEADED BY FAMILY, HEALTH AND MATERIAL WEALTH. SELF-REALIZATION IS ON THE SEMI-PERIPHERY OF THE VALUE HIERARCHY, SERVICE TO SOCIETY IS ON THE PERIPHERY. AT THE SAME TIME, AS FACTORS OF SUCCESS IN LIFE, INTERPRETED AS INSTRUMENTAL VALUES (MEANS OF ACHIEVEMENT), SOCIAL CONFORMISM (OBSERVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, ADHERENCE TO MORAL STANDARDS), PROFESSIONALISM, GOOD FRIENDS AND FAMILY SUPPORT COME TO THE FORE. VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CITIZENSHIP, HELPING OTHERS) ARE OF MEDIUM IMPORTANCE IN THE HIERARCHY OF LIFE SUCCESS FACTORS (MEANS OF ACHIEVING LIFE GOALS). THE FOLLOWING CONTRADICTION HAS BEEN FIXED IN THE VALUE PICTURE OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WORLD: IF LIFE GOALS ARE FORMULATED IN THE PARADIGM OF PRIVACY AND TRADITIONALISM, THEN THE MEANS OF ACHIEVING THEM ARE CONSIDERED TO A LARGE EXTENT THROUGH SOCIAL CONFORMISM AND PROFESSIONALIZATION. THE MOST RATIONAL WAY TO REGULATE THE IMBALANCE IN THE CONDITIONS FOR THE REALIZATION OF LIFE GOALS THAT HAS DEVELOPED IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY, YOUNG PEOPLE CONSIDER TERRITORIAL, INCLUDING CROSS-BORDER MOBILITY.
847	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS THAT SUPPORT THE EXPLOITATION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE SPORTS TOURISM INDUSTRY. THE PRESENT STUDY IS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH BASED ON DATA GATHERED FROM AVAILABLE DOCUMENTARY STUDIES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH 35 EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF SPORTS TOURISM AND SPORTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN IRAN. THE INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODEL (ISM) WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH, 74 INDICATORS WERE IDENTIFIED AND CLASSIFIED UNDER 11 INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, SOCIAL NORMS, SOCIAL VALUES, SOCIAL BELIEFS, EXPERT KNOWLEDGE PROMOTION, SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE PROMOTION, PUBLIC SECTOR SUPPORT, PRIVATE SECTOR SUPPORT, COMPLEMENTARY ATTRACTION, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AT FIVE HIERARCHICAL LEVELS. GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PUBLIC SECTOR SUPPORT WERE IDENTIFIED AS FIFTH-LEVEL FACTORS THAT ACT AS THE MODEL'S CORNERSTONE. FINALLY, THE RESEARCH RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FOR THE GROWTH OF THE SPORTS TOURISM INDUSTRY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS IRAN, OTHER IDENTIFIED FACTORS MUST ALSO BE INVOLVED IN THE GROWTH OF THIS INDUSTRY. IN THIS REGARD, THE EXISTENCE OF AN APPROPRIATE LEGAL, NORMATIVE, SUPPORTIVE, AND EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT WILL AFFECT THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO IDENTIFY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE EMERGING SPORTS TOURISM INDUSTRY.
848	ON 24 FEBRUARY 2022, A MARTIAL LAW WAS IMPOSED IN UKRAINE IN CONNECTION WITH RUSSIA'S MILITARY AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE. THIS PUT NEW LIVING CONDITIONS FOR UKRAINIAN SOCIETY AND STATE POWER INSTITUTIONS ON THE AGENDA. THE JUDICIARY IS AMONG THEM, AND ITS SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONING IS A COMPONENT OF THE STATE SECURITY, THE SOVEREIGNTY OF UKRAINE AND THE RULE OF LAW. ENSURING THE CONTINUITY OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION, WHICH CANNOT BE RESTRICTED EVEN IN WARTIME, REQUIRED SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE DECISIONS THAT WERE TAKEN ON AN AD HOC BASIS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR TWO MONTHS OF FUNCTIONING DURING THE WAR, THE JUDICIARY OF UKRAINE HAS GAINED UNIQUE EXPERIENCE, WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DRAW THE RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS AND LEARN THE LESSONS. THIS PUBLICATION PROVIDES FOR AN OVERVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE COURTS OF UKRAINE DURING THE WAR LAUNCHED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. BASED ON STATISTICS AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, THE AUTHORS REVEAL THE SPECIFICITY OF WORK ARRANGEMENT OF UKRAINIAN COURTS IN WARTIME, HIGHLIGHTING TWO KEY ISSUES: (A) "THE PROBLEM OF TERRITORIES" AND (B) "THE PROBLEM OF PERSONNEL." PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE SECURITY (PHYSICAL, HUMANITARIAN, INFORMATIONAL) OF JUDGES AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE JUDICIARY AND THEIR RESISTANCE TO MILITARY AGGRESSION.
849	EXTANT RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE POLITICS HAS EXAMINED THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, THE NATURE OF THE ELECTORAL SYSTEMS, PARLIAMENTARISM AND FEDERALISM ON THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. UNDERSTANDING VARIATIONS ON EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE HAS ASSUMED A STATE-CENTRIC APPROACH THAT HAS LARGELY NEGLECTED HOW STRONG LEGISLATURES CAN DRASTICALLY AFFECT POLITICAL OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY FINDS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE STRENGTH OF NATIONAL LEGISLATURES (IN TERMS OF ITS INFLUENCE OVER THE EXECUTIVE, INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY, ITS SPECIFIED POWERS AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY) IS CORRELATED TO EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AS MEASURED BY VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW ENTRENCHMENT BASED ON A CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS OF 150 COUNTRIES WITH AVAILABLE DATA FROM THE PERIOD 1996-2016. THE RESULTS HOLD EVEN WHEN THE SAMPLE IS RESTRICTED TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE PARTY SYSTEMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNDER-INSTITUTIONALIZED. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ALSO CONFIRMS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRONG LEGISLATURES AND EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IS NOT ATTENUATED OR CONDITIONED BY ITS INTERACTIVE EFFECT WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. IMPLICATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE STRENGTH OF NATIONAL LEGISLATURES PROMOTES HIGHER LEVELS OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST FOCUS ON FRAMEWORKS THAT STRENGTHEN GLOBAL LEGISLATURES TO AVERT POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND CREEPING AUTHORITARIANISM.
850	THE PAPER IS A RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT CRISIS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY CONSEQUENCES OF THE ONGOING CRISIS CAUSED BY THE CORONA VIRUS. TENSIONS BETWEEN POLITICAL LIBERALISM, BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE ECONOMIC LIBERALISM OF THE GLOBALIZED MARKET REQUIRE A REVISION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF KANT'S LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND HIS SYSTEM OF PUBLIC LAW IN ORDER TO REMOVE ITS INSTRUMENTALIST DISTORTIONS. IN THE WORKS THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS, PART THE DOCTRINE OF RIGHT AND THE PERPETUAL PEACE: A PHILOSOPHICAL SKETCH, KANT WRITES ABOUT THREE CONCEPTUALLY DIFFERENT AND INTERDEPENDENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC LAW: CIVIL (IUS CIVITATIS), INTERNATIONAL (IUS GENTIUM), AND COSMOPOLITAN (IUS COSMOPOLILICUM). EACH LEVEL REGULATES A DIFFERENT AREA OF LEGAL RELATIONS AND IS GOVERNED BY ITS OWN REGULATORY IDEA. THE ABSOLUTE EFFECTIVENESS OF KANES SYSTEM OF LAW REQUIRES THE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION OF ALL THREE LEVELS. THE RESULT OF THIS SYNERGY IS THE CREATION OF A STATE OF A GLOBAL LEGAL CERTAINTY, A GLOBAL LEGAL STATE AS A GUARANTEE OF PERPETUAL PEACE, WHICH IS, IN THE SENSE OF KANT'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW, THE ONLY REGULATORY IDEA FOR ANY MUTUAL (POLITICAL) HUMAN ENDEAVOUR.
851	THIS CONTRIBUTION SKETCHES THE EMERGENCE OF DEMOCRATIC SELF-DEFINITIONS IN THE NETHERLANDS, FROM THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY UNTIL THE POST-WAR PERIOD, WHEN IT HAD BECOME COMMONPLACE TO DEFINE THE COUNTRY AS DEMOCRATIC. ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE IS THE USE OF THE WORD AND CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY BY CONTEMPORARIES AND DUTCH AND FOREIGN HISTORIANS, AND IT ARGUES THAT THE HISTORY OF DUTCH 'DEMOCRACY' HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY AN EMPHASIS ON FREEDOM, SELF-GOVERNMENT BY A BROADLY DEFINED ELITE AND A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY, RATHER THAN BY PARTICIPATION OF THE POPULATION AT LARGE. DEMOCRACY ONLY BECAME REALLY POPULAR AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR WHEN IT COULD BE DEFINED AS PROTECTION AGAINST DICTATORSHIP. THE DUTCH CASE SHOWS THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT EQUATING A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY OR EVEN THE RULE OF LAW WITH DEMOCRACY IN THE SENSE OF THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. DEMOCRACY WAS DEFINITELY ACCEPTED AS A LABEL TO CHARACTERIZE THE NETHERLANDS AFTER IT HAD BEEN REDEFINED AS IN ESSENCE THE OPPOSITE OF DICTATORSHIP INSTEAD OF THE OPPOSITE OF ARISTOCRACY. THE DUTCH CASE ALSO SHOWS THAT A HIGHLY DEVELOPED, CIVIL SOCIETY CAN EVEN CONFINE RATHER THAN PROMOTE THE NEED FOR POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND FOR A VIBRANT INDEPENDENT POLITICAL SPHERE.
852	THE ADOPTION OF COMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT WILL ESTABLISH THE BASIS FOR IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS NEEDED TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. NONETHELESS, THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT FOR THESE REFORMS TO BE EFFECTIVE THE RIGOROUS AND SUSTAINED SUPPORT OF DECISIVE ACTORS IS NEEDED. OTHERWISE, NO MATTER HOW PROGRESSIVE OR INNOVATIVE THESE REFORMS MAY SEEM ON PAPER, INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS COULD BECOME INEFFECTUAL OR CANCELLED DE FACTO. THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES THIS ARGUMENT BY PROVIDING AN ANALYSIS OF MEXICO'S NATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION SYSTEM (SNA). THE SNA REPRESENTS THE CASE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION AIMED AT REBUILDING ACCOUNTABILITY IN A COUNTRY CHARACTERIZED BY PERSISTENT AND PERVASIVE POLITICAL CORRUPTION. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SNA EMERGED FROM A LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT INCLUDED THE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION OF A NETWORK OF EXPERTS AND SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS SUBJECT DURING A POLITICALLY FAVORABLE MOMENT DUE TO CORRUPTION SCANDALS THAT AFFECTED THE INCUMBENT GOVERNMENT. AS A RESULT, THE ORIGINAL INITIATIVE PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT WAS REPLACED BY A MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS AND PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT THE SNA HAS BEEN CONFRONTED WITH DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AT A NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. SPECIFICALLY, THE AMBIVALENT AND WEAK COMMITMENT TOWARDS THIS SYSTEM, HIGHLIGHTED BY KEY ACTORS IN DECISIVE MOMENTS, HAS LIMITED ITS FULL IMPLEMENTATION.
853	STUDYING HATE CRIMES IN A COUNTRY DIVIDED ALONG SECTARIAN LINES, SUCH AS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, PRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGE FOR RESEARCHERS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF HATE CRIMES ARE MULTIFACETED, AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL CRIME-CONTROL MECHANISMS THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING, THESE EVENTS CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT SOCIETY AT LARGE. HATE CRIMES OFTEN LEAD TO ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS HOMOGENISATION, POLARISATION, INTOLERANCE, OVERT HATRED AND VIOLENCE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH FINDINGS RELEVANT TO POLICING HATE CRIMES IN POST-CONFLICT BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. SPECIAL FOCUS IS PLACED ON POLICING AT THREE LEVELS: GOVERNMENT POLICY (STRATEGIES FOR ACTION AT THE LEVEL OF THE INTERIOR MINISTRIES), POLICE POLICY (THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION STRATEGIES IN LOWER ORGANISATIONAL UNITS) AND POLICE PRACTICE (POLICE FIELDWORK). THE STUDY IS PRIMARILY BASED ON A QUALITATIVE APPROACH INCLUDING INTERVIEWS, OBSERVATIONS AND SECONDARY DATA ANALYSES. THE GENERAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CRIME CONTROL IS INADEQUATE AND INFLUENCED BY AN APPARENT LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM. OUR FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED THE ABSENCE OF ANY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES, WHICH IMPLIED NUMEROUS PROBLEMS IN POLICING AT ALL LEVELS. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, AS A TRANSITIONAL POST-CONFLICT COUNTRY, HAS A LONG WAY AHEAD IN ESTABLISHING LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL ENABLE THE RULE OF LAW, PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND ENSURE POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
854	ACCORDING TO SEVERAL MEMBER STATES COPYRIGHT REGIMES, LAWS AND REGULATIONS SHOULD BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE, FREE OF CHARGE, AS ONLY FREE ACCESS COMPLIES WITH BASIC STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND TRANSPARENCY. INDEED, LEGAL TEXT IS GENERALLY EXEMPTED FROM COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. HOWEVER, WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH PRIVATELY CREATED RULES, I.E. TECHNICAL STANDARDS INCORPORATED IN LAWS BY REFERENCE? ARE TECHNICAL STANDARDS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE 'LAW', AND EXEMPTED FROM COPYRIGHT PROTECTION, OR SOMETHING ELSE? ON THE CONTRARY, IF SUCH TECHNICAL STANDARDS ARE NOT 'LAW', BUT THE RESULT OF PRIVATE INTELLECTUAL CREATIVITY, ACCESS MAY RESTRICTED. GENERALLY, STANDARD-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CHARGING FOR ACCESS TO TECHNICAL STANDARDS CLAIMING COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. HOWEVER, FROM THE RECENT JAMES ELLIOTT CASE, WE NOW KNOW THAT EU HARMONIZED STANDARDS, I.E. TECHNICAL STANDARDS REFERRED TO IN CERTAIN EU DIRECTIVES, FORMS PART OF EU LAW AND MAY BE INTERPRETED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE. SO, NO COPYRIGHT? EUROPEAN HARMONIZED STANDARDS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE FOR COPYING, UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING? WELL, IT DEPENDS. INDEED, THE JAMES ELLIOT CASE RAISES INTERESTING QUESTIONS OF BOTH CONSTITUTIONAL AND COMMERCIAL CHARACTER IN REFERENCE TO THE STATUS OF TECHNICAL STANDARDS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN LAW, OF WHICH SOME ARE DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE.
855	THE DRAFTERS OF THE 1982 UN CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS) HAVE LEFT BEHIND A LACUNAE IN TERMS OF THE REGULATIONS CONCERNING BIODIVERSITY IN THE AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION (BBNJ). AS LIVING ORGANISMS ARE FOUND IN THE DEEP SEABED IN AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION, AS WELL AS THE UTILIZATION OF MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, STATES ARE CURRENTLY DELIBERATING ON THE PROPER REGIME IN DEALING WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY. SOME STATES ARGUE THAT PART XI UNCLOS APPLIES HENCE BBNJ IS ALSO PART OF THE COMMON HERITAGE OF MANKIND. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME STATES BELIEVE THAT PART VII UNCLOS APPLIES WHICH WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUAL STATES TO EXPLOIT THE RESOURCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FREEDOM OF THE HIGH SEAS. SINCE 2004, THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAS ESTABLISHED A WORKING GROUP TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE. INDONESIA AS A PARTY TO UNCLOS WHICH IN GENERAL ADVOCATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE OCEANS HAS THE INTEREST THAT THE DISCUSSION IN THE UN WILL ALLOW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, INCLUDING INDONESIA, TO ENJOY THE RESULT OF THE EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION OF NON-MINERAL RESOURCES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.
856	THIS ESSAY ANALYZES AN ESSAY BY H. L. A. HART ABOUT DISCRETION THAT HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN PUBLISHED, AND HAS OFTEN BEEN CONSIDERED LOST. HART, ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, WROTE THE ESSAY AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL IN NOVEMBER 1956, SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED AS A VISITING PROFESSOR. IN THE ESSAY, HART ARGUED THAT DISCRETION IS A SPECIAL MODE OF REASONED, CONSTRAINED DECISIONMAKING THAT OCCUPIES A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN ARBITRARY CHOICE AND DETERMINATE RULE APPLICATION. HART BELIEVED THAT DISCRETION, SOUNDLY EXERCISED, PROVIDES A PRINCIPLED WAY OF COPING WITH LEGAL INDETERMINACY THAT IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ESSAY SITUATES HART'S PAPER DISCRETION IN HISTORICAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONTEXT, INTERPRETS ITS MAIN ARGUMENTS, AND ASSESSES ITS SIGNIFICANCE IN JURISPRUDENTIAL HISTORY. IN THE CONTEXT OF HART'S WORK, DISCRETION IS NOTABLE BECAUSE IT SKETCHES A THEORY OF LEGAL REASONING IN DEPTH, WITH VIVID EXAMPLES. IN THE CONTEXT OF JURISPRUDENTIAL HISTORY, DISCRETION IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON LONG-OVERLOOKED HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HART'S WORK AND THE LEGAL PROCESS SCHOOL, THE AMERICAN JURISPRUDENTIAL MOVEMENT DOMINANT AT HARVARD DURING HART'S YEAR AS A VISITING PROFESSOR. HART'S DISCRETION IS PART OF OUR JURISPRUDENTIAL HERITAGE, ADVANCING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND ITS HISTORY.
857	REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NEOLIBERALISM HAS DECLINED OR WHETHER IT IS STILL APPROPRIATE TO SAY NEOLIBERAL', IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT (NPM) REFORM WILL CONTINUE AND SURVIVE CHALLENGES IN KOREA. BY ANALYZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NPM-BASED GOVERNMENT REFORMS AND ROLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW DURING THE LAST DECADES IN KOREA, THE ARTICLE TRIES TO EXPLAIN NOTABLE PERSISTENCE OF THOSE LEGACIES OF THE NPM REFORMS. FINANCIAL EMERGENCIES, SUCH AS THE 1997 FOREIGN CURRENCY CRISIS IN KOREA AND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN RECENT YEARS, COULD REPEAT THEMSELVES AT ANY TIME. GOVERNMENT REFORM WILL THEN CONTINUE TO BE A SURVIVING TOOLKIT TO COPE WITH SUCH CRISES. ANOTHER FACTOR IS CITIZENS' DESIRE AND EXPECTATION, WHICH IS TAXPAYERS' DEMAND. WITH THIS UNDIMINISHED, EVER-INCREASING DEMAND FOR BETTER QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, THERE COULD BE NO WAY OUT BUT TO REFORM GOVERNMENT BY DOWNSIZING AND RESTRUCTURING ITSELF IN THE NAME OF EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. NPM-BASED GOVERNMENT REFORM HAS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, AS LONG AS SUCCESS CANNOT BE GUARANTEED BY PUBLIC TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CONFIRMING THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT CONSTITUTE INDISPENSABLE AND SOUNDEST MEANS TO BUILD TRUST, WHICH IS A CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR IN GOVERNMENT REFORMS.

858	ON THEIR COMING TO POWER, THE PRINCES OF THE ANCIENT LOW COUNTRIES ARE GREETED BY THE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO THUS RECOGNIZE THEM AS THEIR LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGNS: THESE ARE KNOWN AS THE "JOYEUSES ENTREES". THE EXCHANGE OF RECIPROCAL OATHS BETWEEN THE NEW SOVEREIGN AND THE INHABITANTS IS A FUNDAMENTAL EVENT IN THE COURSE OF THESE CEREMONIES. THIS OATH IS IN ITS ESSENCE CONSTITUTIONAL AND SERVES AS BASIS FOR THE RELATION BETWEEN GOVERNED AND GOVERNING. DURING THE ARCHDUKES' REIGNS AND MORE EXACTLY BETWEEN 1598 AND 1623, THE RECIPROCAL OATH-TAKING CEREMONY WAS OFTEN REPEATED. NOW, AFTER A STRETCH OF TIME - THE XVITH CENTURY - WHEN THIS PRACTICE HAD FALLEN INTO QUASI-DISUSE OR DISREPUTE NOTABLY BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR AND THE SHAKY OBEDIENCE TO THE KING OF SPAIN - THE RESUMPTION OF THIS RITUAL IN THE EARLY XVIITH CENTURY (1599, 1600, 1616 AND 1623) DEFINITELY MARKS A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PUBLIC REASSERTION OF THE FIDELITY OWED TO THE PRINCE. THE STUDY OF THE ARCHDUKES' "JOYEUSES ENTREES" PERMITS THUS TO CARRY OUT A RE-READING OF THE PUBLIC OATH AND MAKE OUT THE NATURE OF THE RECIPROCAL OATH HINDING THE PEOPLE AND THE SOVEREIGNS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS ACT IN THE COMMON LAW OF THE ANCIENT LOW COUNTRIES.
859	THIS PAPER PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND STABILITY, BROADLY DEFINED TO INCLUDE THE LEVEL OF BANKING ACTIVITY AND THE STABILITY OF THE BANKING SECTOR. WE USE A UNIQUE DATASET CAPTURING A VARIETY OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE FEATURES ACROSS COUNTRIES, SUCH AS COVERAGE, PREMIUM STRUCTURE, ETC., AND SYNTHESIZE AVAILABLE INFORMATION BY MEANS OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT INDICES. THIS PAPER SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES SAMPLE SELECTION CONCERNS BY ESTIMATING A GENERALIZED TOBIT MODEL BOTH VIA MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND THE HECKMAN TWO-STEP METHOD. THE EMPIRICAL CONSTRUCT IS GUIDED BY RECENT THEORIES OF BANKING REGULATION THAT EMPLOY AN AGENCY FRAMEWORK. THE BASIC MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM IS THE INCENTIVE FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO ENGAGE IN EXCESSIVELY HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES, RELATIVE TO SOCIALLY OPTIMAL OUTCOMES, IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE OPTION VALUE OF THEIR DEPOSIT INSURANCE GUARANTEE. THE OVERALL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT GENEROUS GOVERNMENT-FUNDED DEPOSIT INSURANCE MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH IN THE LONG RUN, EXCEPT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND BANK SUPERVISORS ARE GRANTED SUFFICIENT DISCRETION AND INDEPENDENCE FROM LEGAL REPRISALS. INSURANCE PREMIUM REQUIREMENTS ON MEMBER BANKS, EVEN WHEN RISK-ADJUSTED, ARE INSTEAD FOUND TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT IN RESTRAINING BANKS' RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR.
860	PREVIOUS ANALYSES OF THE PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES IN THE BRITISH COLONIES HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE PERIOD AFTER 1780. THIS ARTICLE USES THE MID-EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY RECORDS OF THE SLAVE COURT OF THE PARISH OF ST. ANDREW, JAMAICA, TO ANALYZE THE CRIMES FOR WHICH SLAVES WERE PROSECUTED AND THE JUDICIAL PUNISHMENTS THEY RECEIVED. PROSECUTIONS CONCENTRATED HEAVILY ON A FEW OFFENCES, ESPECIALLY THEFT AND RUNNING AWAY. PUNISHMENTS WERE SEVERE AND WERE LARGELY CONCERNED WITH THE SLAVE'S BODY; THEY INCLUDED DEATH, FLOGGING, TRANSPORTATION, AND BODILY MUTILATION. SOME PUNISHMENTS MADE USE OF THE COTTON TREE, WHICH FIGURED SIGNIFICANTLY IN AFRO-JAMAICAN COSMOLOGY, SUGGESTING THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE TRYING TO HARNESS OR COMBAT THE POWER OF OBEAH. THE ARTICLE COMPARES THE JAMAICAN SLAVE COURT'S PRACTICE TO THAT OF BRITISH COURTS IN THE SAME PERIOD, AS WELL AS TO THE EXPERIENCE OF SLAVES UNDER OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THE SLAVE COURT ENACTED RITUALS THAT BOTH DRAMATIZED AND SUSTAINED POWER RELATIONS, BUT RATHER THAN REPRESENTING THE SUPPOSED COMMON DISCIPLINE OF ALL TO A SINGLE RULE OF LAW, AS DID THE CONTEMPORARY BRITISH SPECTACLE OF TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT, THE JAMAICAN COURT'S PRACTICE EMPHASIZED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENSLAVED AND FREE, VALORIZING THE PRIVATE PENAL POWER OF THE MASTER UNDER SLAVERY.
861	INSPIRED BY THE 32-YEARS LONG BELENE TRIAL, THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF DEPRIVATION FROM THE RIGHT TO JUSTICE ON REACHING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN AFTERMATHS OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. THROUGH BOTTOM-UP VICTIMS-CENTERED PERSPECTIVE THE ARTICLE DIGS INTO THE BELENE VICTIMS' ORAL HISTORY NARRATIVES TO FIND OUT THE IMPACT OF THIS DEPRIVATION ON THE SOCIETAL CONTRACT, VICTIMS' TRAUMA, JUSTICE PERCEPTION OF THE SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEWS AND NARRATIVES OF THE BELENE VICTIMS, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF NEGLECTING THE VICTIMS' RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND PERPETUATING IMPUNITY, NOT ONLY IMPEDING JUSTICE AND HEALING BUT PERPETUATING VICTIMIZATION AND CORRODING SOCIETAL TRUST. THE SUSTAINED DENIAL OF VICTIMS' RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE EXACERBATES HISTORICAL WOUNDS, ERODES THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE JUSTICE AND COLLECTIVE PERCEPTION OF FAIRNESS IN THE WHOLE SOCIETY. BEYOND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS, THE DEPRIVATION FROM RIGHT TO JUSTICE AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND OVERALL SOCIETAL PEACE. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE, ENABLING THE REBUILDING OF A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY ON PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND EMPATHY, ESPECIALLY IN THE COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE AFTERMATH OF ETHNICBASED CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.
862	POPE BENEDICT XVI'S 2011 ADDRESS TO THE BUNDESTAG CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESIS OF HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF LAW AS A SUBSYSTEM WITHIN SOCIETY. HE UNDERSCORED THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE, GOVERNED BY AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS BOTH FREE AND DEDICATED TO UPHOLDING HUMAN DIGNITY. FURTHERMORE, HE EXHORTED POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS ALIKE TO PERSISTENTLY PURSUE JUSTICE, TO CRITICALLY ASSESS THE LAW AS RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS, AND TO ASPIRE TO HIGHER MORAL STANDARDS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, HE CAST DOUBT ON THE ADEQUACY OF SCIENTIFIC LEGAL POSITIVISM AND SCIENTISM IN COMPREHENDING LAW AND THE REALM OF REASON. STEMMING FROM HIS SCEPTICISM CONCERNING THE SUFFICIENCY OF POSITIVISM IN THE FORMULATION AND INTERPRETATION OF LAW, HE EMPHASIZED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EUROPEAN "LEGAL HERITAGE". ACCORDING TO BENEDICT, THIS TRADITION ORIGINATED FROM THE CULTURAL TRIANGLE OF JERUSALEM, ATHENS, AND ROME, AND SERVES AS AN INDICATOR OF A "RATIONAL LEGAL ORDER". AS POPE BENEDICT XVI'S ADDRESS WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD OF JURISPRUDENCE AND LEGAL HISTORIANS, MY ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE OF THE NOTION OF "LEGAL TRADITION" WITHIN THE SELECTED EUROPEAN CONTEMPORARY LEGAL SYSTEMS.
863	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES VARIOUS ISSUES OF RACE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE USA THROUGH THE LENSES OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND BLACK RADICAL TRADITION, PRECISELY TO CONVEY THE FACT THAT RACISM IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL IN THE USA AND REVERBERATES THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE. AMERICAN LEGAL SCHOLARS ARE DIVIDED ON WHICH LEGAL METHODOLOGY IS MOST APPROPRIATE IN ADDRESSING RACIAL CUM LEGAL ISSUES. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT TACKLING THE SYSTEMIC RACISM AND THE PERILOUS PROCLIVITY OF THE POLICE IN BRUTALIZING BLACK PEOPLE IN THE USA CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CURRENT (MAINSTREAM) FRAMEWORKS OF RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY BECAUSE, ARGUABLY, THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE ERECTED ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF SLAVERY AND RACISM TO PRINCIPALLY SERVE THE INTERESTS OF WHITE AMERICANS. USING LEGAL STORYTELLING, THE ARTICLE NARRATES SPECIFIC CASES OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND AMPLIFIES THE VOICES OF CRITICAL RACE THEORISTS THAT RACISM IN THE USA CANNOT TRULY BE DISMANTLED SOLELY VIA DEMOCRATIC DIALOGUES AND LEGAL FORMALISM AS THE MAINSTREAM VIEW TENDS TO ALWAYS SUGGEST. IT POSITS THAT THE HEFTY INTELLECTUAL EFFORT REQUIRED TO POSITIVELY BEND THE MAINSTREAM TOWARDS REALIZING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF BLACK PEOPLE IN THE USA CAN ONLY BE SHOULDERED ON BLACK RADICALISM AND 'RACIAL REALISM', AS DERRICK BELL, CEDRIC ROBINSON, AND OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE OPINED.
864	POLITICAL LONGEVITY IN YOUNG DEMOCRACIES HAS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS ALIKE DUE TO SEVERAL PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCH DEMOCRACIES, SUCH AS A LOW LEVEL OF TRUST, A LOW LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY, CORRUPTION, ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, A LESS WELL-ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW AND AN INCREASED BUREAUCRACY. IN SUCH A CONTEXT, WE STUDIED THE TENURE DURATION OF ROMANIAN MINISTERS SINCE 1989, AS WELL AS THEIR ACCUMULATED POLITICAL LONGEVITY IN MINISTERIAL OFFICES. USING PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION, WE OBSERVED SOME PECULIARITIES IN THE YOUNG ROMANIAN DEMOCRACY IN COMPARISON WITH MORE ESTABLISHED REGIMES. WE OBSERVED THAT LEFT-WING MAJORITIES TEND TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF SEAT CHANGES AND THUS DIMINISH TENURE LONGEVITY. WE ALSO OBSERVED THAT GOOD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO THE SUBSTITUTION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF MINISTRIES, WHILE HIGHER INFLATION RATES TEND TO SHORTEN TENURE LONGEVITY FOR ROMANIAN MINISTERS. MOREOVER, OUR ESTIMATIONS SUPPORT THE FINDING THAT ROMANIAN MINISTERS TEND TO HAVE SHORTER TENURES AS THE NUMBER OF PAST MINISTERIAL FUNCTIONS INCREASES AND THAT THE BURDEN OF SIMULTANEOUSLY MANAGING VARIOUS MINISTRIES SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE SHORTER POLITICAL LONGEVITY OF A GIVEN MINISTER. FINALLY, RECENT MINISTERS HAVE HAD LONGER TENURES THAN THOSE IN THE FIRST YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE IN 1989.
865	THE FIELD OF "BUSINESS FOR PEACE" RECOGNIZES THE ROLE THAT BUSINESSES CAN PLAY IN PEACEBUILDING. HOWEVER, LIKE MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION CONCERNING BUSINESS IN CONFLICT ZONES, IT HAS PRIORITIZED THE VIEW OF MULTINATIONALS, OFTEN OVERLOOKING THE ROLE OF INDIGENOUS LOCAL FIRMS. THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND INTERGROUP DYNAMICS EXPERIENCED BY LOCAL BUSINESSES IN CONFLICT ZONES ARE UNDERSTUDIED, WITH THE CURRENT PAPER BEGINNING BY POSITIONING MICRO- AND SMALL ENTERPRISES (MSES) IN THE PEACEBUILDING DEBATE, THEN ENGAGING WITH MULTIDISCIPLINARY WORKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FOSTER PEACE. THROUGH A CASE STUDY SET IN NORTH LEBANON, WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH TWENTY-THREE MSE OWNERS IN ONE INDUSTRY WHO OPERATE ACROSS SECTARIAN DIVISIONS AND WITH RECENTLY DISPLACED SYRIAN REFUGEES. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT LOCAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE PEACE AND FOSTER CONFLICT, WITH PEACEBUILDING IMPROVED WHEN INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES ARE REDUCED WITHIN THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS ELEVATED FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES, SUGGESTING THAT PEACE THROUGH MECHANISMS SUCH AS SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, AND TRAINING, IS ONLY ACHIEVED IF ECONOMIC NEEDS ARE ALLEVIATED THROUGH THESE MEASURES. WE CONCLUDE BY CITING HOW CONTEXTUAL FACTORS IN CONFLICT ZONES CAN ENHANCE INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES, AND HOW RESOLVING SUCH FACTORS CAN PROMOTE PEACEBUILDING, WITH FURTHER EMPIRICAL WORK NEEDED IN THIS AREA.
866	IN GENERAL TERMS, THE RESEARCH PROJECT REQUIRED TO ACCEDE TO THE ACADEMIC CAREER FOCUSES ON WHAT, OR ABOUT WHAT AND HOW IT IS INTENDED TO DO A RESEARCH IN A PARTICULAR SUBJECT, BY DESCRIBING THE MASTER LINES OF THE FUTURE RESEARCH TASK. THAT IMPLIES TO SHOW THE OWN RESEARCH REASONINGS, BOTH THE SUBSTANTIAL AND THE METHODOLOGICAL ONES, THAT IS TO SAY, THE PERSONAL IDEA OF THE RESEARCH ABOUT THE MATTER. IN THIS SENSE, THE AUTHOR PROPOSES A RESEARCH BASED ON THE STUDY OF THE CHALLENGES AND FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF TAX LAW, BY DEFENDING A METHODOLOGY AIMED AT REVISING THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE DISCIPLINE IN LIGHT OF THE CLASSICAL PRINCIPLES OF TAX JUSTICE, LEGALITY AND CERTAINTY. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, RESEARCH ON TAX LAW SHOULD DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE REGULATION IN FORCE IS ADEQUATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS DERIVED FROM THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE TAX ACTIVITY. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO RECLAIM THE RELEVANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES IN THE JURIDICAL RESEARCH ON TAX LAW, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW DEPENDS, IN A HIGH EXTENT, ON THE COMPLIANCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF TAX JUSTICE, LEGALITY AND CERTAINTY.
867	BEYOND THE ESOTERIC DELIBERATIONS OF ISLAMIC JURISTS AND THEIR EXEGESIS OF CRIMINAL AND PRIVATE LAW DOCTRINES, IRANIAN LAW LIVES A LIFE OF ITS OWN. IT IS A LIFE OF ROUTINE PRACTICES OF JUDGES, COURT CLERKS, LAWYERS AND CLIENTS, EACH OF WHOM IS STRIVING TO TURN THE LAW TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE. IT IS ALSO A LIFE OF CONTESTED LEGALITY, A RELENTLESS STRUGGLE OVER THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE THE LAW IN A JURIDICAL FIELD WHICH IS INFUSED WITH STRIFE AND HOSTILITY. THESE CONFLICTS ARE REPRODUCED DAILY AS TWO COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF LAW, AND THEIR CORRESPONDING PERCEPTIONS OF LEGALITY CLASH IN PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. THE IRANIAN JUDICIARY'S CONCEPT OF LAW, ITS RECONSTRUCTION OF ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE AND METHODS OF DISPENSING JUSTICE, WHICH ON THE SURFACE ARE REMINISCENT OF MAX WEBER'S QDI-JUSTICE, COLLIDE WITH THE LEGAL PROFESSION'S FORMAL RATIONAL UNDERSTANDING THEREOF. HOWEVER, IRANIAN JUDGES ARE NOT WEBERIAN QDIS, AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS NOT A HOMOGENOUS GROUP OF ATTORNEYS DRIVEN BY A COLLECTIVE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONFLICT, WE NEED TO EXPLORE THE MUNDANE WORKINGS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF IRANIAN SOCIETY AND THE UNRESOLVED DISPUTES OVER THE DIRECTION OF ITS MODERNITY.
868	THE STATE OF EXCEPTION HAS COME TO WEAKEN THE RULE OF LAW; THAT IS, IT HAS ENABLED THE SOVEREIGN TO NOT ONLY INCREASE ITS POLITICAL POWER BUT TO SUSPEND THE LAW ITSELF. THIS INVESTIGATION DEMONSTRATES HOW THE POST-9/11 STATE OF EXCEPTION (OR OF EMERGENCY, NECESSITY, OR MARTIAL LAW) IS INCREASINGLY USED AS THE BASIS OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN GOVERNANCE. THIS FORM OF GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN INTENSIFIED SINCE 9/11 BY SUSPENDING NORMAL RULES AND PROCEDURES AND REPLACING THEM WITH EXTRAJUDICIAL MEASURES THAT UNDULY JEOPARDIZE FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. THE FIRST SECTION DEVELOPS A FRAMEWORK FOR THE STATE OF EXCEPTION THAT DRAWS FROM GIORGIO AGAMBEN. IT ESTABLISHES THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION TODAY AND DESCRIBES HOW THE EXCEPTION IS A LIMINAL SPACE DEVOID OF ALL LAW THE FOLLOWING SECTION PROVIDES EVIDENCE AS TO HOW THE STATE OF EXCEPTION HAS ENTERED A SELF-REINFORCING PROCESS IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE 9/11. IT ADAPTS THE TENDENCIES OF PATH DEPENDENCY FROM PAUL PIERSON'S INCREASING RETURNS FRAMEWORK AND APPLIES THEM TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION FROM THREE PRESIDENCIES SINCE 9/11 (FROM BUSH TO OBAMA TO TRUMP) TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SELF-REINFORCING PROCESSES END UP PROLONGING STATES OF EMERGENCY THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY.
869	COORDINATED (CO)OPERATION OF COMPETENT STATE BODIES AND INSTITUTIONS IN DEALING WITH ECONOMIC CRIME AND CORRUPTION, JOINT PRIORITIES, MOTIVATED AND SKILLED INVESTIGATORS (WHO ARE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR TASKS WITHIN A SPECIALIZED MULTIDISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATION TEAM), REPRESENT EFFECTIVE WAYS FOR RESTRICTING THIS TYPE OF CRIME WITH GREATER EFFICIENCY. BESIDES, IT IS A STEP FORWARD IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN LAW. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SMOOTH AND UNDISTURBED OPERATIONS OF SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAMS, IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT MEMBERS OF THE INVESTIGATION TEAM AND HEADS OF COMPETENT STATE BODIES ASSIGN TOP PRIORITY TO SOLVING TASKS RELATED TO WORK OF THE SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAM. IN THE MOST DEMANDING CASES OF ECONOMIC CRIME AND CORRUPTION, THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN THE FORM OF SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAMS ENSURES THAT A CASE IS DEALT WITH IN A QUICK, COMPLEX AND COORDINATED MANNER. THE LEGAL EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCES OF THE STATE PROSECUTOR, AS WELL AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TACTICS, FORENSIC SCIENCES AND METHODOLOGY AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERTS FROM OTHER STATE BODIES AND INSTITUTIONS ARE THUS JOINED IN ONE PLACE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION TEAM PROVIDES FOR THE USEFUL AND NECESSARY EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS OF THE TEAM.
870	HUMANITY IS INCREASINGLY AWARE OF ITS GLOBAL INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND INTERGENERATIONAL INTERDEPENDENCE, WHICH REQUIRE NEW ETHICAL REFLECTION. THIS RESEARCH ARTICLE FIRST PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE THROUGH VARIOUS HISTORICAL PERIODS AND CULTURES. IN THE SECOND PART THE CONCEPT OF INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE, WHICH HAS SO FAR BEEN MOST SISTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED BY THE GERMAN ETHICIST WERNER VEITH, IS MORE BROADLY PRESENTED. THE LAST PART OF THE DISCOURSE PRESENTS THE UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTICE IN THE DOCUMENTS OF THE MAGISTERIUM OF THE CHURCH, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF POPE BENEDICT XVI, WHO HAS DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE FIRST AS A CARDINAL AND LATER AS THE POPE. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE MULTIFOLD MEANING OF THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE, WHICH EXPANDS FROM THE INDIVIDUAL ETHICAL UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTICE AS A VIRTUE TO THE INTERPERSONAL, SOCIAL, INTERSTRUCTURAL, INSTITUTIONAL AND ULTIMATELY INTERGENERA TIONAL LEVEL THE LAST LEVEL INCLUDES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE LIFE OF SOCIETY, WHICH DOES NOT CONCERN ONLY THE PRESENT BUT ALSO THE FUTURE, INCLUDING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND THE WORLD. THE ARTICLE ENDS WITH AN OPEN QUESTION AND A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF JUSTICE, LEGAL ORDER, AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH CAN ONLY BE CONSTITUTED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF FREE AND RATIONAL INDIVIDUALS, OR ON THE ASSUMPTION OF AN ORDER DICTATED BY THE OBJECTIVE REALITY (NATURE).
871	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE PROCESS THAT DEBTOR COUNTRIES GO THROUGH IN THE TWO MECHANISMS CREATED TO WORK OUT SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HUGE AND UNPAYABLE EXTERNAL DEBTS, NAMELY, THE PARIS CLUB AND THE HEAVILY INDEBTED POOR COUNTRIES (HIPC) INITIATIVE. AS THE INTERNATIONAL LENDING PROCESS IS STRUCTURED TODAY, IT IS THROUGH THESE MECHANISMS THAT DEBTOR COUNTRIES OBTAIN DEBT FORGIVENESS, REDUCTION OR RESCHEDULING. THE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THESE TWO MECHANISMS BY CREDITOR COUNTRIES WILL BE EXAMINED, TOGETHER WITH THE CRUCIAL ROLE RESERVED TO THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) AS THE FINAL DISPENSER OF THE 'STAMP OF APPROVAL' WHETHER DEBTOR COUNTRIES WILL ULTIMATELY GET DEBT RELIEF. ALSO, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE SO-CALLED 'CONDITIONALITIES' THAT ARE ATTACHED TO DEBT RELIEF OBTAINED THROUGH THE PARIS CLUB AND HIPC INITIATIVE. WHAT SORT OF POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS, 'STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS' OR OTHER DOMESTIC CHANGES ARE BEING PUSHED THROUGH THESE MECHANISMS? AND FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THESE CONDITIONALITIES COMPORT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC SELF-DETERMINATION OF PEOPLES THAT SUPPOSEDLY GUARANTEES THEIR RIGHT TO PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ESSENTIALLY, THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS: ARE THE PARIS CLUB AND HIPC MECHANISMS FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH ECONOMIC SELF-DETERMINATION? AND MORE GENERALLY, ARE THEY RESPECTFUL OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM?
872	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CHANGES TO AND RELATIONS BETWEEN LABOR POLICY AND LABOR LEGISLATION IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA'S MARKET TRANSITION WITH A FOCUS ON THE 1994 LABOR LAW AND THE 2007 LABOR CONTRACT LAW. THE INITIAL IMPETUS TO LABOR POLICY CHANGE CAME FROM THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS AT THE END OF THE 1970S AND THE EARLY 1980S. SINCE THEN, THE STATE HAS RELAXED ITS CONTROL OVER LABOR MOBILITY AND JOB ALLOCATION. THE LAST TWO DECADES OF THE LAST CENTURY WITNESSED THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES IN CHINA'S LABOR POLICY, THAT IS, THE REPLACEMENT OF LIFELONG EMPLOYMENT WITH CONTRACT-BASED EMPLOYMENT AND THE REPLACEMENT OF GOVERNMENT JOB ASSIGNMENT WITH THE LABOR MARKET. SUCH CHANGES INDICATE THE PARADIGMATIC SHIFTS OF CHINA'S LABOR POLICY IN THE REFORM ERA. UNDER THE NEW LABOR POLICY PARADIGM, THE ROLE OF LAW HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED IN GOVERNING LABOR RELATIONS AND OTHER LABOR-RELATED AFFAIRS. WITHIN THE POLICY CONTEXT OF PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE MAINTAINING SOCIAL STABILITY, BOTH POLICY AND LAW ARE COORDINATED AND COMPLEMENTARY IN STABILIZING LABOR RELATIONS AND PROTECTING LABOR RIGHTS. GIVEN THE SOCIOECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, POLICY IS STILL IMPORTANT DURING THE PERIOD OF MARKET TRANSITION.
873	RULE OF LAW IS USUALLY ANALYZED EXCLUSIVELY IN REFERENCE TO DOMESTIC PEACE WITHIN THE POLITICAL ENTITY. YET, ESTABLISHING A POWERFUL INDEPENDENT LEGAL SYSTEM CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON PEACEFUL RELATIONS BETWEEN POLITICAL ENTITIES. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY'S PERFORMANCE IN CREATING DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS FROM ITS INCEPTION IN THE SUMMER OF 1994 UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF THE ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS IN SEPTEMBER 2000. THREE POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS DRAWN FROM THE LITERATURE ON STATE FORMATION ARE EVALUATED IN EXPLAINING THE OUTCOME: THE FOREIGN INTERVENTION THESIS BLAMES THE FAILURE ON THE ASYMMETRY OF POWER BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PLO; THE DOMESTIC STRUCTURAL CLAIM IS THAT THE WEAKNESS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM STEMS FROM THE UNWILLINGNESS OF THE RULER TO LIMIT HIS POWER; AND THE CULTURAL ARGUMENT CLAIMS THAT ONLY ANGLO-SAXON AND EUROPEAN STATES ARE TRULY LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE QUEST FOR POWER LED TO CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE EXECUTIVE, DESPITE VALIANT ATTEMPTS BY POLITICIANS AND CIVIL SOCIETY TO AVERT SUCH AN OUTCOME, AND THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE TYPES OF OBSTACLES THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME TO TRANSFORM THE PALESTINIAN ENTITY INTO A DEMOCRATIC REALITY THAT WOULD PROMOTE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE WITH ITS NEIGHBORS.
874	SAFE ZONES, INITIALLY ESTABLISHED AS PRACTICAL TOOLS FOR REFUGEE PROTECTION, HAVE EVOLVED INTO DIPLOMATIC INSTRUMENTS. THROUGH THE CASE OF NORTHERN SYRIA IN A HISTORICAL-COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE LINK BETWEEN BORDER POLITICS AND HOST STATE-INDUCED RETURN TO THE SAFE ZONES; AND QUESTIONS THE VIABILITY OF RETURN WITHIN THIS POLITICISED ENVIRONMENT. CONSIDERING THE EARLIER EXPERIENCES OF SIX CASES IN SRI LANKA, IRAQ, SOMALIA, BOSNIA, RWANDA, AND AFGHANISTAN, IT SHOWS HOW SAFE ZONES AND REFUGEE RETURN HAVE BECOME VENUES FOR POWER STRUGGLES, NOT ONLY BETWEEN THE ORIGIN AND HOST STATES BUT ALSO AMONGST REGIONAL AND GLOBAL POWERS; ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS. THE NORTHERN SYRIAN CASE IS DISTINGUISHED BY TURKEY'S PRESSURE FOR RETURNS DURING THE CONFLICT, WHICH MAKES CONDITIONS FOR RETURN DEPENDENT ON TURKISH MILITARY PRESENCE. WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT OR A UNSC DECISION, TURKEY'S SELF-PROCLAIMED SAFE ZONE LACKS INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY, AND REFUGEE RETURNS REMAIN DEPENDENT ON UNILATERAL EFFORTS BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT. LACK OF SECURITY, RULE OF LAW, ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES, RECONSTRUCTION, AND OVERALL PROSPECTS UNDERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF SAFE, VOLUNTARY AND SUSTAINABLE RETURNS. AND AS ALL ACTORS INVOLVED PLACE THEIR MILITARY OBJECTIVES ABOVE CIVILIAN GOVERNANCE, CONDITIONS FOR SECURITY IN THE SAFE ZONE REMAIN PRECARIOUS.
875	THE NEW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS SET BY THE UN INCLUDE A GOAL OF MAKING CITIES INCLUSIVE, SAFE, SUSTAINABLE, AND RESILIENT. CITIES ARE GROWING AT HUGE RATES, AND CONDITIONS OF DETERIORATING QOLS ARE INCREASING IN THE FORM OF POOR ACCESS TO SERVICES, AND SLUMS ARE REMARKABLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE CITIES OF THE MIDDLE EAST; HENCE, THE RESEARCH PROBLEM CAN ARISE FROM A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE IN DETERMINATION OF A WAY TO ASSESS THE RESILIENCE OF CITIES TO DEVELOP MECHANISMS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF URBAN LIFE. IN THIS STUDY, A TOOL CALLED CRF HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CITY'S RESILIENCE PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE, ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL, INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS, AND THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE AND STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP. THE RESEARCH AIMS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF KUFA CITY IN ACHIEVING THE PRINCIPLES OF RESILIENCE ACCORDING TO THE CRF. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICAL METHOD. THE RESEARCH CONCLUDED THAT THE CITY OF KUFA ACHIEVES LOW LEVELS OF SOME INDICATORS OF RESILIENCE, ESPECIALLY ON THE IMPOSITION OF SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, TRANSPORTATION, AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND ACHIEVES REASONABLE RATES OF RESILIENCE REGARDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CREATING A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY AND ACHIEVING BASIC NEEDS.
876	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CAREER AND THOUGHT OF FRENCH POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER BLANDINE KRIEGEL (B. 1943) FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE MOST STRIKING PARADOX THEY PRESENT: THOUGH SHE WAS A STUDENT OF MICHEL FOUCAULT, WHO WAS FAMOUS FOR HIS CRITIQUE OF CENTRAL ROLE THAT POLITICAL THINKING HAS TRADITIONALLY ACCORDED THE STATE, KRIEGEL HAS, SINCE THE MID-1970S, BEEN ONE OF THE FOREMOST CHAMPIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF ETAT DE DROIT-THE STATE AS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE "RULE OF LAW"-IN FRENCH POLITICAL DEBATES. AT A TIME WHEN POST-1968 CRITICS OF MARXISM AND TOTALITARIANISM (NOTABLY THE SO-CALLED NOUVEAUX PHILOSOPHES) WERE ARGUING THAT STATES WERE INHERENTLY DESPOTIC, KRIEGEL MOUNTED AN ORIGINAL DEFENSE OF THE STATE, WHICH, SHE ARGUED, HAD PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN ESTABLISHING LEGAL RIGHTS THAT FREED INDIVIDUALS FROM THE "SLAVERY" OF CIVIL SOCIETY. SHE WAS ABLE TO DO THIS, IN PART, BY DRAWING ON SEVERAL SUGGESTIVE ELEMENTS FOUND IN FOUCAULT'S WORK: HIS CONCEPT OF BIOPOLITICS, THE CLAIM THAT INDIVIDUALS AND SUBJECTIVITY ARE CONSTITUTED THROUGH POWER RELATIONS, AND THE INSIGHT THAT WAR AND SOVEREIGNTY REPRESENT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CONCEPTUALIZING POWER. IN THIS WAY, SHE USED ASPECTS OF FOUCAULT'S POLITICAL THOUGHT TO ARRIVE AT A DECIDEDLY NON-FOUCAULDIAN APPRECIATION OF THE MODERN STATE.
877	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE SCENARIO OF PENAL INSECURITY AND THE EXALTATION OF THE PUNITIVE STATE INSTALLED IN CONTEMPORARY BRAZILIAN SOCIETY, WITH CONSEQUENT PUNITIVE MEDIA DISCOURSE AROUND THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROPOSALS (PECS) THAT DEAL WITH THE REDUCTION OF THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY FROM 18 TO 16 YEARS OF AGE, RAISED TO THE CONDITION OF STONE CLAUSE IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION, IT REPRESENTS A PARADOX IN THE POST-CAPITALIST SOCIETY OF CRISES, INEQUALITIES AND DIVERSIFIED "YOUTHS" IN DIVERSE CONTEXTS. THIS LEGAL-POLITICAL-SOCIAL SCENARIO IS DEMONSTRATING A NOTABLE WEAKENING OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND GUARANTEES OF CHILDREN'S RIGHTS REGULATED BY THE ECA (STATUTE OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, LAW NO. 8090/1990), BEING A TRANSPARENT EFFECT OF THE DECLINE OF THE WELFARE STATE, WHOSE SYMBOLIC CRIMINAL HARDENING BY INCARCERATION PUNISHES POVERTY AND CAMOUFLAGES THE SYNDROME OF INEFFECTIVENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IN THIS SENSE, THROUGH DOCTRINAL RESEARCH AND THE ANALYTICAL AND DEDUCTIVE METHOD, IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE CONDUCT OF ADOLESCENTS FROM 16 YEARS OF AGE MANIFESTS A STATE OF SOCIAL PHOBIA AND CRIMINAL INSECURITY WITH THE IMPOSITION OF PENAL REGULATION, BEING THE ADOPTION OF PEC AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEASURE THAT AFFRONTS THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
878	DRAWING ON AMARTYA SEN'S CONCEPT OF AGENCY AND CAPABILITY, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN THREE DIMENSIONS: INDIVIDUAL DISPOSITIONS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION, AND PROCESSES OF PARTICIPATION. IT PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH THAT EXAMINES THESE DIMENSIONS IN RELATION TO PRACTICES OF PARTICIPATION AS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND CITIZENS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. TWO EXAMPLES ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THIS APPROACH IN STATES WHERE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE DEFICIENT. THE FIRST EXAMPLE HISTORICALLY TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF TRIBAL INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN JORDAN TO DEMONSTRATE HOW AND WHY THEY MEDIATE PEOPLE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THE SECOND EXAMPLE USES NARRATIVE INQUIRY TO EXPLORE COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS' ASPIRATION FOR AND COMMITMENT TO POLITICAL EXPRESSION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA IN VIETNAM. BOTH EXAMPLES SUGGEST THAT A COUNTRY'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND ITS RULE OF LAW MAY SHAPE POLITICAL CULTURES AND SOCIETAL VALUES OF PARTICIPATION, BUT IT IS THE INDIVIDUALS' RECOGNITION AND RESPONSE TO THESE STRUCTURES THAT ULTIMATELY CREATE THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE. THE ARTICLE EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXTS IN WHICH THE RESPECTIVE TRADITION OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION TAKES PLACE IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE OUTCOMES AS WELL AS THE CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION, ESPECIALLY IN CONTEXTS THAT THEORETICALLY QUALIFY AS AUTHORITARIAN.
879	THE ARTICLE DISCLOSES THE PECULIARITIES OF THE INTERPRETATION OF NATIONAL LAW BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW (VENICE COMMISSION OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE). FIRST OF ALL, ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF CONSTITUTIVE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS (RESOLUTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND OF THE AGREEMENTS OF THE STATES CONCERNED) THE AUTHOR DEFINED THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STATUS OF THE VENICE COMMISSION AS AN AUTONOMOUS, SPECIALIZED ADVISORY BODY OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. THE AUTHOR REFERS THE INTERPRETATION OF NATIONAL LAW BY THE VENICE COMMISSION TO A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL INTERPRETATION, BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF ACTS OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN A VIEW OF THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH EUROPEAN STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IS A NEW PHENOMENON IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DOCUMENTS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION SHOWS THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF ACTS OF INTERPRETATION: THE FIRST IS AN ACT OF INTERPRETATION IN THE PROPER SENSE OF THIS WORD WHEN COMMISSION MAKES AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DOCUMENT. THE SECOND TYPE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNTYPICAL ACTS OF THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW, SINCE THEY DO NOT MENTION ANY FOUNDATION DOCUMENTS. THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE ACTS OF THE COMPETENT, PROFESSIONAL AND DOCTRINAL INTERPRETATION.
880	SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS (SWFS) HAVE BECOME IMPORTANT AND CONTROVERSIAL IN GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE ANALYZE WHY SOME SWFS HAVE MORE ENCOMPASSING AND CLEARLY SPECIFIED GOVERNANCE RULES THAN OTHERS. WE ARGUE THAT SWF INSTITUTIONALIZATION IS STRUCTURALLY ROOTED IN A COUNTRY'S REGIME TYPE AND NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS IN PUBLIC POLICYMAKING. DEMOCRACY PROMOTES SWF INSTITUTIONALIZATION BY ITS NEED FOR STRONG RULE OF LAW, VOTERS TRYING TO CONSTRAIN OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIORS OF POLITICIANS, AND THE FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION. IN CONTRAST, THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS HAS A CURVILINEAR EFFECT. WHEN THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS IS VERY SMALL, INSTITUTIONALIZATION IS TOO RIGID, CONSTRAINING, AND NOT PREFERRED; WHEN THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS IS MODERATE, IT IS OPTIMAL FOR VETO PLAYERS TO MANAGE THEIR CONFLICT OVER SWF GOVERNANCE IN A MORE ROUTINE AND INSTITUTIONALIZED FASHION; AND WHEN THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS GROWS ABOVE A THRESHOLD, IT BECOMES TOO COSTLY TO COORDINATE AND PRODUCE MUTUALLY AGREEABLE INSTITUTIONAL RULES. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF 46 SWFS IN 30 COUNTRIES FROM 2007 TO 2009 PROVIDES ROBUST CONFIRMING EVIDENCE. SWF GOVERNANCE IS MORE INSTITUTIONALIZED AND TRANSPARENT IN DEMOCRACIES AND IN COUNTRIES WITH FOUR VETO PLAYERS. OUR RESEARCH HAS IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ONGOING DEBATE OVER SWF.
881	AFGHANISTAN IS LARGELY KNOWN AS A TRIBAL PEASANT SOCIETY, WHERE THE DOMINANT ORGANISED SOCIO-POLITICAL FORCES ARE THE TRIBES AND THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT, AND WHERE DEMOCRATIC AND SECULAR MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY ABSENT FROM THE POLITICAL SCENE. IT IS THE TRIBAL CHIEFS AND THE RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENT THAT REPRESENT AND MOBILISE PEOPLE. HOWEVER, LIBERAL AND CONSTITUTIONALIST MOVEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY HAVE HAD A RELATIVELY RICH BACKGROUND SINCE THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. WHILE THE FIRST CONSTITUTIONALIST POLITICAL PARTY EMERGED IN THE EARLY 1900S, THE FIRST LIBERAL PARTY, WATAN (OR HOMELAND), EMERGED IN THE LATE 1940S IN THE AFTERMATH OF WORLD WAR II, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED SOME CHANGES IN THE METHOD OF RULING. THE PARTY BECAME THE MOST VOCAL AND INFLUENTIAL IN POLITICAL CIRCLES AT THE TIME. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW A LIBERAL-NATIONALIST POLITICAL PARTY EMERGED AND OPERATED EVEN THOUGH THE RULING CLASS HAD LITTLE DESIRE FOR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR RULE OF LAW. IT EXPLORES THE FEATURES OF THE PARTY, INCLUDING ITS PLATFORM, GOALS, SOCIAL AND ETHNO-RELIGIOUS MAKE-UP AND THE METHOD OF STRUGGLE CHOSEN TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, WHICH ALSO ENABLED IT TO TAKE A LEADING ROLE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN THE EARLY 1950S.
882	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A RANGE OF DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES THAT DOMINATE THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF A RANGE OF SOCIAL ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANIZATION OF LYARI TOWN, ONE OF THE OLDEST SETTLEMENTS OF KARACHI. UNDERWRITTEN BY A NARRATIVE OF HISTORIC MARGINALIZATION AS WELL AS RESISTANCE, THESE DISCOURSES ARE LINKED TO EMERGING SOCIO-SPATIAL PRACTICES IN THIS AREA THAT ARE HIGHLY PRESCRIPTIVE. THESE PRACTICES HAVE CREATED A LANDSCAPE OF PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY SPACES: SPORTS CLUBS, PARKS, SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTRES WHICH HAVE MATERIALIZED AS A RESULT OF A COMBINATION OF AGITATORY AS WELL AS PATRONAGE POLITICS AND EVEN SUPPORT FROM THE CRIMINAL UNDERGROUND. THERE IS A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON SPORTS, NAMELY SOCCER AND BOXING, AS NOT ONLY PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES FOR THE YOUTH BUT ALSO AS A STRONG MARKER OF BALOCH POLITICAL IDENTITY, THE BALOCH BEING THE DOMINANT ETHNIC GROUP IN LYARI. I ARGUE THAT BY DEPLOYING A PRODUCTIVE DISCOURSE AROUND PLACE, ETHNICITY AND POLITICAL MARGINALIZATION, THESE ASSEMBLAGES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF POWERS HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN MODE OF GOVERNANCE WHICH IS EMERGING IN A CONTEXT WHERE THE STATE'S ROLE IN THE PROVISION OF MUNICIPAL SERVICES AND CITY-MAKING REMAINS CONTESTED AND AMBIGUOUS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IS SEEN TO BE WEAK OR ABSENT.
883	WHEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IMPOSED DIRECT RULE IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN MARCH 1972, MILITARY POLICY LAY IN TATTERS. INTERNMENT WITHOUT TRIAL, DEEP INTERROGATION AND BLOODY SUNDAY CONVINCED MANY PEOPLE THAT THE BRITISH ARMY WAS FUNDAMENTALLY REPRESSIVE. YET THE ARMY MAINTAINED A POLICY COMMITMENT TO ALWAYS OPERATING WITHIN LEGAL CONSTRAINTS. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES HOW THE ARMY, AT THE POLICY-MAKING LEVEL, RESPONDED TO ALLEGATIONS THAT IT WAS TREATING THE CATHOLIC POPULATION IN A BRUTAL MANNER. SOLDIERS OFTEN BELIEVED THERE TO BE 'SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE', THAT ALLEGATIONS WERE SIMPLY A SMEAR CAMPAIGN DIRECTED BY THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY. AT THE SAME TIME, CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS WERE ALLOWED AGAINST SOME SOLDIERS WHO BROKE THE LAW. BUT THESE WERE FEW IN NUMBER, AS THE AUTHORITIES STRUGGLED TO GATHER EVIDENCE. NEW EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED ON CIVIL CASES BROUGHT AGAINST THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, MOST OF WHICH WERE SETTLED OUT OF COURT. ALTHOUGH DETERMINED TO AVOID ADMITTING LIABILITY, BY JANUARY 1975 THE GOVERNMENT MADE 410 PAYMENTS IN CASES THEY EXPECTED OTHERWISE TO LOSE IN COURT. SENIOR ARMY COMMANDERS ATTEMPTED TO THWART INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS IN NORTHERN IRELAND, AND CALLED FOR MILITARY LAW TO HAVE JURISDICTION. THESE EFFORTS ACHIEVED LITTLE SUCCESS, BUT THEY DEMONSTRATE THE LIMITS TO THE ARMY'S COMMITMENT TO OPERATING WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW.
884	WHEN IS AN APPLICANT FOR REFUGEE STATUS "UNWORTHY" OF ASYLUM? IT USED TO BE THOUGHT THIS QUESTION WAS TOLERABLY CLEAR. BUT IN THE CURRENT FEBRILE ATMOSPHERE OF POST-9/11, WHERE AN AVALANCHE OF NEW INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN DRAWN UP IN THE "WAR ON TERROR" TO TACKLE "TERRORISM", IT IS ANYTHING BUT CLEAR. TRADITIONALLY UNDERSTOOD CONCEPTS OF CRIMES AGAINST PEACE, WAR CRIMES, OR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ARE ALSO IN A STATE OF FLUX. THE LAW IS WORRYINGLY MOVING TOWARDS A CONCEPT OF "UNWORTHINESS FOR ASYLUM", WHICH, UNLESS ARRESTED BY THE COURTS, LOOKS SET TO UNDERMINE THE INSTITUTION OF REFUGEEHOOD ITSELF. AS STATES DEVELOP NEW COUNTER-INSURGENCY MEASURES AMID NEW FORMS OF WARFARE, "COMPLICITY", BY WAY OF ASSOCIATION IN THE NEFARIOUS ACTS OF OTHERS, IS NOW DEEMED BY GOVERNMENTS TO BE ENOUGH TO REJECT GENUINE ASYLUM-SEEKERS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE INTERPRETATION OF THE EXCLUSION CLAUSES OF ARTICLE 1F OF THE REFUGEE CONVENTION IN THE CASE-LAW OF GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA. THESE ARE COUNTRIES WITH STRONG HUMAN RIGHTS TRADITIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND WITH A PROUD HISTORY OF DEFENDING REFUGEE RIGHTS. WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE, IN THE CHANGED POLITICAL CLIMATE OF THE LAST DECADE, IS THE QUESTION.
885	CONSIDERING THE BASIC ASSUMPTION THAT THE MODERN LAW AND STATE THEORY DOES NOT ONLY BEAR SIMILARITIES, BUT ALSO DRAWS TRUE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PARALLELS TO THE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THEOLOGY, HANS KELSEN INTENDS TO LAY BARE THE IDEOLOGICAL MEANING THAT LIES AT THE VERY CORE OF THE TRADITIONAL DUALISM WHICH CONSTITUTES LAW AND STATE INTO AUTONOMOUS ENTITIES. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT KELSEN"S ORIGINAL PERCEPTIONS WHICH ARE SECONDED BY MORE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CLAUDE LEFORT AND HANS LINDAHL'S POLITICAL AND SYMBOLIC CONCEPTS AND FROM CARL SCHMITT'S NOTIONS ON POLITICAL THEOLOGY - OUR INTENTION IS NOW TO DEMONSTRATE THE HIGHLY CONSERVATIVE ROLE PLAYED BY THE DUALITY OF THE LAW/STATE STRUCTURE, WHOSE AIM IS TO REMOVE, FROM UNDER THE SWAY OF LEGAL CONTROL, A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE STATE'S ACTIONS. HEREBELOW, THEREFORE, WE WILL ANALYSE THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF THE SO-CALLED "PUBLIC LAW," WHICH SEEMS TO POINT TO A TREND TOWARDS SHUNNING THE LEGAL POWER REGULATION. FINALLY, BASED ON THE FUNCTIONAL METHOD PIONEERED BY ERNST CASSIRER, LEGAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS "COLLECTIVE WILL" AND "PUBLIC INTEREST" WILL BE PROBLEMATISED, IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEY CONTAIN THEOLOGICAL, CONSERVATIVE AND AUTHORITARIAN TRAITS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONCEPTUAL AND SUBSTANTIAL UNITY INTRINSIC TO THE RULE OF LAW.
886	THE COMMISSION ON THE LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR (CLEP) WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN 2005 AND CONCLUDED IN 2008. ALTHOUGH INSPIRED BY HERNANDO DE SOTO'S ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE SCOPE OF THE COMMISSION WAS DEFINED AS 'LEGAL EMPOWERMENT' IN GENERAL. THIS COMMENTARY OFFERS A CRITIQUE OF THE CLEP REPORT, AND ARGUES THAT ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS REST ON AN IDEALISED VERSION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IN WHICH A DYNAMIC MARKET ECONOMY ASSURES 'WIN-WIN' SOLUTIONS FOR ALL. THIS IMPLIES THAT THERE ARE NO TENSIONS BETWEEN THE FOUR 'PILLARS' OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT IDENTIFIED BY CLEP (THE RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS, LABOUR RIGHTS, AND BUSINESS RIGHTS). HOWEVER, IN THE REAL WORLD OF CAPITALISM, IN BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND AUTHORITARIAN VERSIONS, THERE ARE STRUCTURAL TENSIONS BETWEEN CLASSES OF CAPITAL AND CLASSES OF LABOUR, WHICH RESULT IN THE ECONOMY AND ITS UNDERLYING INSTITUTIONAL ORDER BECOMING A KEY SITE OF CONTESTATION. THE CASE OF FARM LABOUR IN RURAL SOUTH AFRICA IS USED TO ILLUSTRATE THIS ARGUMENT. A FOCUS ON LEGAL RIGHTS CAN, HOWEVER, BE 'EMPOWERING' TO A DEGREE, WHEN IT HELPS DEFEND POOR PEOPLE FROM EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE, OR IS LOCATED WITHIN BROADER STRATEGIES TO ERADICATE SYSTEMIC POVERTY.
887	WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A GOVERNMENT'S RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF ITS OWN CITIZENS AND THAT GOVERNMENT'S REGARD FOR REFUGEE RIGHTS? ON ONE HAND, WE MAY EXPECT THAT A COUNTRY WITH HIGH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS WILL ALSO OFFER A HIGHER QUALITY OF ASYLUM. DOMESTIC LAWS THAT PROTECT CITIZENS' RIGHTS MAY BE EXTENDED TO REFUGEES, FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE REASONS TO THEORIZE THAT A COUNTRY WITH HIGH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS MAY OFFER A LOWER QUALITY OF ASYLUM. FOR INSTANCE, GOVERNMENTS MAY CLAIM THAT PROTECTING CITIZENS' WELLBEING NECESSITATES THE REJECTION OF REFUGEES. TO EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS, I ANALYSE A GLOBAL DATASET DRAWN FROM REPORTS BY THE US COMMITTEE FOR REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS. I FIND THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND REFUGEE RIGHTS IS MODIFIED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE SIZE OF THE REFUGEE POPULATION. MOREOVER, SOME DOMESTIC RIGHTS (LIKE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND LABOR RIGHTS) MAY INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR REFUGEES, WHILE OTHERS (LIKE RULE OF LAW) MAY DECREASE THEM. REFUGEES HAVE BEEN LARGELY ABSENT FROM THE LITERATURE ON THE POLITICS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. BY SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN AND REFUGEE RIGHTS WORLDWIDE, THIS PAPER FILLS AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE SCHOLARLY AND POLICY LITERATURE.
888	HUNGARIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CULTURE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CONSIDERED AS OVERTLY LEGALISTIC AND PROCEDURALIST, WHICH APPEARS TO BE IN CONTRAST WITH CLAIMS OF WEAKENING THE RULE OF LAW OR FACING SANCTIONS UNDER ARTICLE 7 OF THE TREATY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN OVERVIEW ON THE CRITICISMS PUT FORTH BY ACADEMIC WRITERS AND EU INSTITUTIONS REGARDING THE HUNGARIAN DEVELOPMENT PATH AND PUTS THEM INTO THE WIDER CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIZATION THROUGH TRANSACTION (TRANSITOLOGY, DEMOCRACY EXPORT) THEORY. THE ARTICLE COMPARES FINDINGS OF CONTEMPORARY INTERVENTIONIST AUTHORS WITH THE PROPOSITIONS OF SUCH ICONIC WRITERS AS DANKWART RUSTOW (1970) AND SAMUEL P. HUNTINGTON (1984) AND ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN THESE REALMS OF THOUGHT. THESE AUTHORS ALL SHARE THE VIEW THAT DEMOCRACY SHALL BE EXPORTED THE MORE AND QUICKER THE BETTER. TRANSITOLOGY, THOUGH, HAS HAD ITS CRITICS, WHILE CONTEMPORARY INTERVENTIONIST THEORY APPEARS TO BE RATHER MONOLITHIC WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE CRITICISM. THE ARTICLE USES THE APPROACH OF PAYNE (2006), AND OF OTHER AUTHORS, TO QUESTION VARIOUS STATEMENTS OF CONTEMPORARY INTERVENTIONISTS. NOT LEAST, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN PROVIDE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE AMBITIONS OF TRANSACTIONAL DEMOCRATISATION ARE PREDETERMINED TO FALL SHORT ON NON-DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IMPOSING DEMOCRACY USING NON-DEMOCRATIC MEASURES ON RECIPIENTS OF VARIOUS SORTS.
889	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A SYSTEMIC CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION. IT DOES SO BY ENGAGING WITH THE DEBATE ON THE SO-CALLED COALITION PROBLEM. THE COALITION PROBLEM ARISES BECAUSE NON-DOMINATION HOLDS THAT GROUPS CAN BE AGENTS OF (DOMINATING) POWER, WHILE ALSO INSISTING THAT FREEDOM BE ROBUST. CONSEQUENTLY, IT SEEMS TO ENTAIL THAT EVERYONE IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF DOMINATION AT THE HANDS OF POTENTIAL GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM CAN BE DISSOLVED BY REJECTING A 'STRICT POSSIBILITY' STANDARD FOR INTERPRETING NON-DOMINATION'S ROBUSTNESS REQUIREMENT. FRANK LOVETT AND PHILIP PETTIT PROPOSE TO RESTRICT THE RELEVANT DOMAIN OF POSSIBLE WORLDS BY REFERENCE TO TWO EPISTEMIC CONDITIONS PERTAINING TO POTENTIAL GROUP MEMBERS. I ARGUE THAT THIS STRATEGY UNDULY LIMITS NON-DOMINATION'S CRITICAL POTENTIAL. I THEN ARGUE THAT A SUITABLY SYSTEMIC CONCEPTION OF DOMINATION AVOIDS THIS PROBLEM. BY PLACING EXPLANATORY EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND HOW THESE BEAR ON THE FEASIBILITY OF INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE ACTION, A SYSTEMIC CONCEPTION OF NON-DOMINATION AVOIDS THE COALITION PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT RETAINS ITS CRITICAL POTENTIAL. THE ARTICLE CLARIFIES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SOCIAL NORMS AND OBJECTS TO THE CLAIM THAT NON-DOMINATION IS BOUND TO DEEM THE LATTER IRRELEVANT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF FREEDOM.
890	MEXICAN JUDGES ARE INCREASINGLY ACTING AS INTERNATIONAL LAW JUDGES. THEIR INTERNATIONAL, JUDICIAL, INCLUDES A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF A JUDICIAL FUNCTION PER SE: DISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL RULES BY AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIAL BODY THE INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER OF THIS WORK DEPENDS ON THE RECOURSE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A LEGAL BASIS FOR THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT OF THE PARTICULAR CASES BROUGHT TO THEIR JURISDICTION. MEXICAN JUDGES ARE PERFORMING AN INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL FUNCTION WHEN THEY INTERPRET INTERNATIONAL LAW NORMS AND PRINCIPLES, WHEN THEY GUARANTEE PRIVATE PERSONS' RIGHTS AND DUTIES UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WHEN THEY ASSESS THE CONFORMITY OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMITMENTS OF THE MEXICAN STATE. HOWEVER, AT PRESENT, MEXICAN JUDGES ARE NOT BEHAVING AS ORDINARY JUDGES OF ALL INTERNATIONAL LAZE'. THE PLACE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE MEXICAN CONSTITUTION, THE SLOW DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL REGIME AND THE DEFERENCE OF MEXICAN JUDGES TO THE EXECUTIVE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS HELP EXPLAIN THE CONSTRAINTS UPON THE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL FUNCTION AS EXPERIENCED BY MEXICAN JUDGES. THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF THE MEXICAN POLITICAL REGIME IMPACTS THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY WITH REGARDS TO THE PROMOTION OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
891	IN 2014, THE VIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS CELEBRATED ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY SINCE ITS COMING INTO FORCE IN 1964. SETTING OUT THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES ACCORDED TO DIPLOMATS AND DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS, THE NEGOTIATIONS OF THIS CONVENTION WERE PART OF THE UNITED NATIONS' PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF BRITAIN, ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTORS IN THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. IT EXPLORES HOW BRITAIN'S NEGOTIATION POSITION WAS SHAPED BY DIPLOMATIC REALITIES OF THE 1950S, AND THE STRATEGIES USED TO ENSURE BRITAIN'S INTERESTS BEING REFLECTED IN THE FINAL CONVENTION. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE OVERALL POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT UNDERLINED BRITAIN'S NEGOTIATION POSITION, IN ORDER TO REVEAL THE GENERAL UK POSITION ON THE CODIFICATION OF DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES. DESPITE THE REMARKABLY FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE AT THE 1961 VIENNA CONFERENCE, BRITAIN COULD NOT PRESS THROUGH ALL ITS AMENDMENTS WHICH, THROUGH THE CONCLUDING LEGISLATION PROCESS, PROTRACTED BRITAIN'S RATIFICATION PROCESS. THE ARTICLE SHOWS WHILE LONDON WAS SUPPORTING THE CODIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, CODIFICATION BY CONVENTION WAS NOT ITS ULTIMATE CHOICE. THEREFORE, THE SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION PROCESS WAS MARKED BY AN INTER-DEPARTMENTAL DISPUTE BETWEEN THE FOREIGN OFFICE AND TREASURY, INTER ALIA, ON THE EXEMPTION OF SCOTCH WHISKY FROM EXCISE DUTIES.
892	THE ARREST OF YUKOS CEO MIKHAIL KHODORKOVSKY AND THE DESTRUCTION OF YUKOS MARKED A TURNING POINT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF POST-SOVIET RUSSIA. UNDER KHODORKOVSKY'S LEADERSHIP, IN FOUR YEARS (1999-2003) YUKOS WENT FROM A POORLY-RUN UNDERVALUED COMPANY TO A DYNAMO THAT WAS WORTH A THIRD OF THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT CASE HISTORIES EVER RECORDED. KHODORKOVSKY'S SUPPORT OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION PARTIES WAS LIKELY A PRIMARY FACTOR LEADING TO HIS ARREST. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS ENTRENCHED INTERESTS WHO FELT THREATENED BY KHODORKOVSKY'S SUCCESS AND GROWING POWER AND KNEW HOW TO MANEUVER BOTH HIM AND PUTIN TOWARDS A COLLISION. HOWEVER, THE RAPIDLY APPROACHING MERGER WITH CHEVRONTEXACO WAS THE KEY TO THE TIMING OF THE ARREST. YUKOS DESTRUCTION AND THE ENSUING SLOWDOWN IN RUSSIAN PRODUCTION GROWTH WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE OIL PRICE SPIKE OF 2005-2008. WHILE THE INCREASED OIL PRICE ARGUABLY INITIALLY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON RUSSIA, MUCH OF THAT ADVANTAGE WAS DISSIPATED BY THE CAPITAL FLIGHT THAT DEVELOPED AFTER 2008, AN EFFECT OF THE RETREAT FROM RULE OF LAW, NECESSARY TO BREAK YUKOS. THE BREAKUP OF YUKOSSIBNEFT ALSO POSSIBLY CUT SHORT THE OILFIELD PRODUCTION REVOLUTION THAT EVENTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN THE USA.
893	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS A COMPLEX FORM OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL INTERVENTION USED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO REDRESS STATE-SANCTIONED AND LARGE-SCALE HARMS (BALINT, EVANS, & MCMILLAN, 2014). THE TYPICAL AIMS OF THIS MODEL INCLUDE MAINTAINING PEACE DURING TIMES OF POLITICAL FLUX, INSTALLING RULE-OF LAW, CREATING NEW HISTORICAL NARRATIVES, AND RECONCILIATION (TEITEL, 2003). IN BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE USUALLY CONCERNS 'FRAGILE STATES' OR POST-CONFLICT STATES. GOVERNMENTS, ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS, HOWEVER, ARE BROADENING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE THEORY AND PRACTICE TO INCLUDE HARMS TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN SETTLER STATES SUCH AS CANADA. NOTABLY, RECENT EFFORTS SEEK TO INTEGRATE 'DECOLONIZATION' INTO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AS A DESIRED PROCESS OR GOAL. THIS PAPER IS A CRITICAL INTERVENTION INTO THIS TREND. I DEMONSTRATE THAT CANADA HAS TWO FACES OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE - ONE, INTERNALLY FOCUSED ON 'RECONCILIATION' WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND THE OTHER, EXTERNALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING PEACE AND SECURITY EXPERTISE TO FRAGILE STATES. I BRING LAND-CENTERED UNDERSTANDINGS OF DECOLONIZATION AND INDIGENOUS RESURGENCE INTO CONVERSATION WITH THIS DUALITY TO ARGUE THAT EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE DECOLONIZATION INTO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, WITHOUT TAKING SERIOUSLY ITS ROOTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE WORK WITH WHICH CANADA IS ENGAGED, DOES MORE TO OBSCURE AND DE-LEGITIMIZE INDIGENOUS NATIONHOOD AND SETTLER COLONIALISM ENTIRELY.
894	THIS PAPER PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL SPECIFIC REGULATIONS ON BANKS IN THE EU-27 OVER THE 2004-2010 PERIOD. WE EMPLOY A DATASET OF A WIDE RANGE OF BUSINESS REGULATION INDICES FROM THE "DOING BUSINESS" PROJECT OF THE WORLD BANK. RESULTS FOR THE CREDIT REGULATION INDICES SHOW THAT THE STRENGTH OF CREDITOR RIGHTS IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO BANK PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY COST EFFICIENCY, ALTHOUGH THIS EFFECT SUBDUES DURING THE RECENT CRISIS PERIOD (2008-2010). ON THE OTHER HAND, CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING IMPROVES EFFICIENCY, A RESULT THAT IS FURTHER STRENGTHENED DURING THE CRISIS. TAX-COMPLIANCE COSTS AND ENTRY REGULATION CONSTRAIN BANK EFFICIENCY. MORE STRINGENT REGULATION OF LABOUR, IN TERMS OF MINIMUM WAGE AND DISMISSAL COSTS, AND INSOLVENCY REGULATION ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH EFFICIENCY. FURTHERMORE, REGULATION THAT PROTECTS INVESTORS FROM MANAGEMENT EXPROPRIATION, SUCH AS THE EXTENT OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY, EXERTS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON BANK EFFICIENCY AND MORE SO IN THE CRISIS YEARS. FINALLY, WE USE INTERACTION TERMS BETWEEN THE BUSINESS REGULATION VARIABLES AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AS MEASURED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE CASES THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INFLUENCES THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF BUSINESS REGULATION ON BANK EFFICIENCY. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
895	FOR DECADES, COURTS AND SCHOLARS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A PROTRACTED AND LARGELY POLARIZED DEBATE OVER A SEEMINGLY SIMPLE QUESTION: HOW SHOULD COURTS ADDRESS CASES THAT IMPLICATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS? ON THE ONE HAND ARE THOSE WHO SEEK EXPANSIVE DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE'S CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS. ON THE OTHER ARE THOSE WHO ARGUE THAT THE COURTS MUST ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CASES LEST THEY ABDICATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THE EXECUTIVE IN CHECK. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN FOREIGN RELATIONS CASES ONE THAT NAVIGATES BETWEEN JUDICIAL ABDICATION AND JUDICIAL ENTANGLEMENT. IT ARGUES THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'S DOCTRINE OF HARD LOOK REVIEW CAN BE USEFULLY APPLIED TO MANY SITUATIONS OF EXECUTIVE FOREIGN POLICYMAKING. FOREIGN HARD LOOK REVIEW WOULD ALLOW THE COURTS TO EXERCISE THEIR DUTY TO PREVENT ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS DECISIONMAKING WHILE STILL PRESERVING THE EXECUTIVE'S EXPERTISE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. IN AREAS OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW AS DIVERSE AS THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE, THE PRESIDENT'S COMPLETION POWER, NATIONAL SECURITY DEFERENCE, THE EXECUTIVE'S POWER TO VIOLATE CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE MAKING OF EXECUTIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, FOREIGN HARD LOOK REVIEW PROVIDES A WAY FOR COURTS TO FUIFILL THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE WITHOUT ENCUMBERING THE EXECUTIVE'S MAKING OFFOREIGN POLICY.
896	CONTEMPORARY STUDIES OF CHINESE FAMILY LAW GENERALLY FOLLOW A WESTERN APPROACH, VIEWING THE FAMILY AS A CIVIL CONTRACT. THIS APPROACH HAS SEVERAL FLAWS. FIRST, IT CANNOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY SO MUCH PUBLIC ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO FAMILY LAW ISSUES. SECOND, IT FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC AND PRACTICE OF FAMILY ISSUES IN CHINESE HISTORY. THIRD, IT FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FAMILY. THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A NEW AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CHINESE FAMILY CULTURE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO POLITICAL CULTURE. EMPLOYING WHAT CLIFFORD GEERTZ CALLED "THICK DESCRIPTION," IT STUDIES HOW PEOPLE HAVE IMAGINED THE FAMILY-POLITICAL NEXUS IN CONFUCIANISM, SOCIALISM AND LIBERALISM AS EACH HAS CHARACTERIZED A DISTINCT PERIOD OF CHINESE HISTORY. IT SHOWS CONFUCIAN FAMILY IS AN ETHICAL COMMUNITY OF RESTRAINT OF BIOLOGICAL IMPULSE; THE SOCIALIST FAMILY IS A COMMUNITY OF SACRIFICE AND LABOR; THE LIBERAL FAMILY IS A COMMUNITY OF MARKET INDIVIDUALS; AND THE CONTEMPORARY CHINESE FAMILY IS A COMBINATION OF THESE THREE TRADITIONS. A THICK DESCRIPTION ENABLES US TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE PUBLIC DEBATES ABOUT FAMILY LAW. WHAT IS MORE, IT SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON WHY CHINA'S MARCH TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW HAS NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.
897	THIS PAPER ANALYSES WHETHER THE AGGREGATION OF INDIVIDUAL HAPPINESS SCORES TO A NATIONAL HAPPINESS INDEX CAN STILL BE TRUSTED ONCE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROCLAIMED THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE TO BE THE PURSUIT-OR EVEN MAXIMIZATION-OF THIS NATIONAL HAPPINESS INDEX. THE ANSWER TO THIS INVESTIGATION IS CLEAR-CUT: AS SOON AS THE NATIONAL HAPPINESS INDEX HAS BECOME A POLICY GOAL, IT CAN NO LONGER BE TRUSTED TO REFLECT PEOPLE'S TRUE HAPPINESS. RATHER, THE INDEX WILL BE SYSTEMATICALLY DISTORTED DUE TO THE INCENTIVE FOR CITIZENS TO ANSWER STRATEGICALLY AND THE INCENTIVE FOR GOVERNMENT TO MANIPULATE THE INDEX IN ITS FAVOUR. SUCH A DISTORTION WOULD ARISE EVEN IF THE MEASUREMENT OF SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING CORRECTLY REFLECTED ACTUAL HAPPINESS BEFORE THE INTERVENTION OF GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENTS IN A DEMOCRACY SHOULD ESTABLISH THE CONDITIONS ENABLING INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME HAPPY. THE VALUABLE AND IMPORTANT RESULTS OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH SHOULD BE INTRODUCED INTO THE POLITICAL PROCESS. EACH PERSON SHOULD BE FREE TO PURSUE HAPPINESS ACCORDING TO HIS OR HER PREFERENCES. THIS PROCESS IS SUPPORTED BY OBEDIENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREE MEDIA, AS WELL AS BY EXTENDED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION RIGHTS, DECENTRALIZED PUBLIC DECISION-MAKING, AN OPEN AND EFFECTIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM FOSTERING UPWARD MOBILITY AND THE POSSIBILITY TO FIND SUITABLE EMPLOYMENT.
898	PRIMARY AMONGST THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT BRITISH LAW ACROSS BRITAIN'S EMPIRE WERE COLONIAL MOUNTED POLICE FORCES, AND ONE OF THEIR SHARED PURPOSES WAS TO ENSURE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE'S COMPLIANCE TO COLONIAL RULE. ALTHOUGH THE LAND WARS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE IMPOSITION OF BRITISH RULE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF NATIONAL HISTORICAL MEMORY IN SOME PARTS OF THE "BRITISH WEST", AUSTRALIA AND CANADA HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FRAMED BY NATIONAL FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVES OF PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE WILL COMPARE THE HISTORY AND HISTORICAL MEMORY OF COLONIAL MOUNTED POLICE FORCES IN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA IN RELATION TO THEIR ROLE IN SUBDUING ABORIGINAL RESISTANCE TO COLONIAL SOVEREIGNTY. WHILE BY THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE OPERATIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S COLONIAL MOUNTED POLICE FORCES HAD ACHIEVED LITTLE PURCHASE IN A FOUNDATIONAL STORY OF DEVELOPING AUSTRALIAN NATIONHOOD, OVER THE FIRST DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE OMNIPRESENT IMAGE OF THE MOUNTIE AS THE FOUNDATIONAL FIGURE OF CANADIAN NATIONHOOD NOT ONLY HELPED TO SHAPE A PARALLEL AUSTRALIAN STORY OF A "FINE BODY OF MEN" WHO BROUGHT LAW AND ORDER TO AUSTRALIA'S FRONTIERS, BUT ALSO SERVED BOTH TO OBSCURE AND TO JUSTIFY THE VIOLENCE IN AUSTRALIA'S POLICING HISTORY AGAINST ABORIGINAL PEOPLE.
899	TAKING EFFECT IN MARCH 2005, THE REGULATIONS ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS IS AN OVERDUE DELIVERY OF A MORE BENIGN POLICY TOWARDS RELIGION IN CHINA. COMPREHENSIVE IN SCOPE, IT WAS PROMULGATED ONLY AFTER NUMEROUS DRAFTS AND SIX YEARS OF EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH THE RELIGIOUS, ACADEMIC, LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMUNITIES, FOLLOWED BY A NATIONWIDE EFFORT TO PROPAGATE THE NEW POLICY AT THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. THE REGULATIONS PRESCRIBES A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR STATE-RELIGION RELATIONS, WHERE THE POWER OF THE STATE IS LIMITED BY REDUCING GOVERNMENT APPROVAL AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES. RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS ARE GRANTED INCREASING AUTONOMY FROM STATE IDEOLOGY, IN MANAGING THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS, IN OWNING AND USING RELIGIOUS PROPERTY, AND IN ACCEPTING DONATIONS FROM WITHIN AND OUTSIDE CHINA. THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM OF ADMINISTERING RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS THROUGH DEPARTMENTAL MICRO-MANAGEMENT AND DISCRETIONARY APPROVAL HAS BEEN PARTLY REPLACED BY RULE OF LAW THAT SETS LIMITS ON BUREAUCRATIC RESPONSE TIME TO APPLICATIONS FROM THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES, WHICH ARE NOW EMPOWERED TO LODGE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS, CHALLENGE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS IN COURTS, AND SUE FOR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES FROM ILLEGAL OR NEGLIGENT GOVERNMENT ACTION. WHILE THE STATE STILL MANAGES AND INTERVENES IN RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS, THE ENACTMENT OF SUCH LEGISLATION IS A BENIGN AND OVERDUE CHANGE IN RELIGIOUS POLICY IN THE REFORM PERIOD IN CHINA.
900	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A DECISION BY A GERMAN POSTWAR COURT-THE CASE OF THE GRUDGE INFORMER-WHICH WAS CENTRAL TO THE 1958 DEBATE BETWEEN H.L.A. HART AND LON L. FULLER. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT FULLER'S PRESENTATION OF THE PROBLEM IN THE CASE IS BETTER THAN HART'S BOTH AS A DESCRIPTIVE MATTER AND AS A MATTER OF PROMOTING A MORALLY RESPONSIBLE RESOLUTION-NOT LEAST BECAUSE HART'S METHOD OF CANDOR FALLS SHORT OF ILLUMINATING THE COMPLEXITIES INHERENT IN SUCH CASES. IN PARTICULAR, HART'S POSITIVIST CONCEPTION OF LAW DOES NOT APPRECIATE HOW JUDGES IN SUCH CASES HAVE TO CONTEND WITH A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DOCTRINAL LEVEL AND THE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. AT THE FORMER, JUDGES HAVE TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW SUCH AS THE ISSUES OF CRIMINAL LAW IN THE GRUDGE INFORMER CASE. AT THE LATTER, JUDGES CONFRONT THE QUESTION OF WHAT FULLER CALLED THEIR "IDEAL OF FIDELITY TO LAW, "SINCE THEY ARE FACED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT LEGALITY-THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW-REQUIRES. THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN SUCH IDEALS IS NOT, AS HART SUGGESTED, ONE THAT TAKES PLACE IN AN EXTRALEGAL POLITICAL SPACE. RATHER, IT IS FIRMLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF BOTH LAW AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW.
901	ALTHOUGH THE EARLY STUDENTS OF AFRICAN HISTORY ATTEMPTED TO BREAK WITH WHAT THEY REGARDED AS THE HEGEMONY OF IMPERIAL HISTORY, THEY FREQUENTLY DEPLOYED CONCEPTUAL LANGUAGE DRAWN FROM THE HISTORIES OF THE IMPERIAL METROPOLES. THE TERMINOLOGY OF AFRICAN HISTORICAL STUDIES BORROWED EXTENSIVELY FROM THE TAXONOMY OF WESTERN EUROPEAN HISTORY. WHILE PART OF THE REASON FOR THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE PERCEIVED NEED TO EXPLAIN STRANGE PEOPLES, PLACES AND INSTITUTIONS TO AN UNINFORMED READERSHIP, IT IS ALSO EXPLAINED BY THE WISH OF MANY SCHOLARS IN THIS FIELD TO PROVE AFRICAN HISTORY'S BASIC SIMILARITY TO AND HENCE EQUALITY WITH THAT WESTERN NARRATIVE. THE NATURE OF SUCH ANALOGIES WAS, HOWEVER, SHAPED BY THE FOCUS OF THE EARLY SCHOLARSHIP. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO SHOW THAT THE CONCERNS OF THE EARLIEST SCHOLARS ENGAGED IN THE TASK OF AFRICAN HISTORY WERE TO SHAPE A PARTICULAR VIEW OF THE AKAN PEOPLE OF THE GOLD COAST/GHANA AND ESPECIALLY THEIR POLITIES. THE FACT THAT THESE NINETEENTH- AND EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY AFRICAN INTELLECTUALS WERE LAWYERS AS WELL AS SCHOLARS LAID DOWN WAYS OF REGARDING AKAN POLITIES - AS STATES WITH CONSTITUTIONS AND AS PEOPLES REGULATED BY THE RULE OF LAW - WHICH HAVE RESISTED ALTERNATIVE AND MORE PLAUSIBLE READINGS UNTIL RELATIVELY RECENTLY.
902	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES MEDIA PUBLICITY SURROUNDING THE CASE OF LI NING - A 34-YEAR-OLD NATIVE OF NANJING CITY, JIANGSU PROVINCE, WHO MADE LEGAL HISTORY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) ON 17 OCTOBER 2004 WHEN HE WAS SENTENCED TO EIGHT YEARS JAIL AND FINED 60,000 YUAN FOR ORGANIZING MALE-MALE PROSTITUTION SERVICES IN A RECREATIONAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. REPORTEDLY THE FIRST CONVICTION OF ITS KIND, THE CASE PROVED TO BE CONTROVERSIAL FOR THREE REASONS. FIRST, IT PROMPTED LEGAL DEBATE OVER THE NATURE OF CHINA'S RECENT SHIFT TO A "RULE OF LAW" AND ASSOCIATED CONCEPTIONS OF DUE LEGAL PROCESS AND INDIVIDUAL AND SEXUAL RIGHTS. SECOND, IT INTIMATED THAT HOMOSOCIAL PROSTITUTION - MALE-MALE PROSTITUTION IN WHICH NEITHER PARTICIPANT MAY SELF-IDENTIFY AS HOMOSEXUAL - IS AN INTEGRAL BUT FREQUENTLY NEGLECTED COMPONENT OF CHINA'S BURGEONING, ALBEIT BANNED, SEX INDUSTRY. FINALLY, IT RAISED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PERCEIVED APPROPRIATE PARAMETERS OF SAME-SEX SEXUAL CONDUCT IN A COUNTRY FACING RAPIDLY INCREASING RATES OF HIV/AIDS INFECTION. AN EXAMINATION OF MEDIA COVERAGE OF THESE CONCERNS SUGGESTS THAT ACCUSATIONS OF OFFICIAL HOMOPHOBIA IN THE PRC ARE OVERSTATED: THEY ELIDE THE SPECIFICITY OF DEBATES ON HOMOSEXUALITY IN PRESENT- DAY CHINA DUE TO THEIR OVERARCHING CONCERN WITH WESTERN UNDERSTANDINGS OF SEXUALITY AS CONSTITUTIVE OF SELFHOOD AND ( RIGHTFUL) SOCIOPOLITICAL IDENTITY.
903	THE PECULIARITIES OF THE EXERCISE OF POWERS AND THE PROCEDURE CFTECILOASESON FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT DTEC OF UKRAINE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF MARTIAL LAW FROM FEBRUARY CLPSTHTRRINRAL 24, 2022 ARE EXAMINED.

WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THESE CONDITIONS.
904	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SUPREME FEDERAL COURT (BRAZIL) IN THE JUDGMENTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ORIGINATING FROM INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY BRAZIL AND THE POSTURE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF JAIR MESSIAS BOLSONARO, WHICH OSCILLATES BETWEEN POPULISM AND DENIALISM. THE RHETORICAL STRATEGY OF THE HEADS OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE IS NOT A RECENT NOVELTY IN BRAZIL, THE LAST PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, FOLLOWING THE MODUS OPERANDI OF OTHER COUNTERPARTS, INTENSIFIED THE USE OF POPULISM IN AN ATTACK ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER AND ITS INSTITUTIONS. IN ITS FUNCTIONS, THE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE WAS HELD IN A MERE SUPPORTING ROLE, WITHOUT A CLEAR DEFENSE OF THE INTERNATIONALLY BINDING LEGAL TIES TO BRAZIL OR A POSTURE OF INTERPELLATION TO THE EXECUTIVE FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT OF DOMESTIC LAW IN THE FACE OF THE LAW ARISING FROM OUTSIDE ITS TERRITORY. THUS, THE SUPREME FEDERAL COURT ASSUMED THE CONDITION OF GUARANTOR OF TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL CLAIMS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A BRAKE ON THIS NEGATIONIST POPULISM AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL LAW, CONTEMPLATING THE PREVALENCE OF THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, THE ENVIRONMENT LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS RESEARCH, THE INDUCTIVE METHOD WAS USED, OPERATIONALIZED BY THE OPERATIONAL CONCEPT TECHNIQUES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH AND JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS.
905	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
906	THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC (COVID-19) HAS POSED MANY CHALLENGES TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN A PANDEMIC, GOVERNMENTS MAKE COMPLEX DECISIONS EVERY DAY (RESPOND QUICKLY TO EMERGING DIFFICULTIES), IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE QUARANTINE MEASURES THAT AFFECT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE. SUCH DECISIONS ARE ALSO MADE BY SUCH SUPRANATIONAL ENTITIES AS THE EUROPEAN UNION. WITH THIS IN MIND, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ANALYZE THE INTERACTION AND BALANCE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS IN EU LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE WORK AIMS TO ANALYZE THE BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS IN EU LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. RESEARCH METHODS ARE SUCH METHODS AS DIALECTICAL, HISTORICAL, IDEALIZATION, ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, ABSTRACTION, SYSTEM, FORMALIZATION, COMPARISON, AND MODELING. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, THE AUTHORS CONCLUDED THAT THE SEARCH FOR A BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS IS IN ALL AREAS AND MOSTLY APPLIES TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND, IN A PANDEMIC, THESE POWERS ARE ENSHRINED IN MAJOR INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS, WITH RESERVATIONS ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE LIMITATION UNDER EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AT THE SAME TIME, ENSURING THE BALANCE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF THE RULE OF LAW IS FULFILLED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES, PROPORTIONALITY, AND PUBLIC NECESSITY.
907	THIS PAPER INTRODUCES AN OLIGOPOLY MODEL THAT INCLUDES THREE ACTORS: A CARTEL (COMPRISING TWO OR MORE FIRMS THAT OPERATE LIKE ONE MERGED COMPANY), A GROUP OF COMPETING FRINGE FIRMS, AND A WELFARE MAXIMIZING ANTITRUST AUTHORITY. THE CARTEL IS THE STACKELBERG QUANTITY LEADER AND THE FRINGE FIRMS ARE IN COURNOT COMPETITION WITH RESPECT TO THE RESIDUAL DEMAND. THE CARTEL IS INTERNALLY STABLE IF NONE OF ITS MEMBER FIRMS FINDS IT PROFITABLE TO BECOME A FRINGE FIRM. THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITY CAN DESTABILIZE THE CARTEL IN THE SENSE OF MAKING THE CARTEL INTERNALLY INSTABLE. TO THIS END, THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITY HAS THREE POLICY INSTRUMENTS AT ITS DISPOSAL: ITS OWN EFFORT, A FINE FOR DETECTED CARTELS, AND A LENIENCY PROGRAM FOR CARTEL MEMBERS THAT COOPERATE WITH THE AUTHORITY. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS NOT COSTLESS FOR SOCIETY, A UNIQUE OPTIMAL ANTITRUST POLICY IS DERIVED. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT BOTH, THE OPTIMAL FORCE AND MIX OF THE ANTITRUST AUTHORITY'S POLICY DEPEND ON MARKET CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE AUTHORITY'S OPERATIONS, THE PUBLIC RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE ETHICAL STANDARDS OF THE FIRMS' MANAGERS, THE MARKET VOLUME, AND THE NUMBER OF FIRMS OPERATING ON THE MARKET.
908	OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, A LARGE NUMBER OF PAPERS HAVE TRIED TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS ON A WIDE RANGE OF VARIABLES LIKE GROWTH, TRADE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, INEQUALITY. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES HAVE BEEN INHERENTLY LIMITED BY MEASURES OF THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THESE SUFFER FROM ANY OF A NUMBER OF SHORTCOMINGS, RANGING FROM A LACK OF AVAILABILITY, OBJECTIVITY, OR THE FACT THAT THEY MEASURE A BROADER CONCEPT LIKE THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER TRIES TO ADDRESS THIS GAP BY PROPOSING A NEW INDEX OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE A STATE-SPACE MODEL TO COMBINE ALL AVAILABLE INDICATORS TRACKING THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS INTO AN INDEX THAT COVERS 191 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1994-2014. WE COMPARE IT TO THE EXISTING INDICATORS BY REVISITING THE LINK BETWEEN INEQUALITY, DEMOCRACY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS, USING A PANEL THRESHOLD REGRESSION MODEL WITH FIXED-EFFECTS. DEPENDING ON THE MEASURE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IS USED, THERE CAN BE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE SIZE, SIGNIFICANCE AND EVEN THE SIGN OF THE ESTIMATED PARAMETERS. SPECIFICALLY, IN CONTRAST WITH EXISTING MEASURES, WE FIND THAT A STRENGTHENING OF THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS REDUCES INEQUALITY IN HIGHLY DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ONLY VIA THE GOVERNMENT'S REDISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.
909	THE PHENOMENON OF HATE SPEECH IN THE CONTEXT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH HAS RECENTLY BEEN A SUBJECT OF EVER-INCREASING SCHOLARLY REFLECTION. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSED AND EVALUATED ERIC HEINZE'S PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM OF (HATE) SPEECH. HEINZE CONSIDERS FREEDOM OF SPEECH A CITIZEN'S PREROGATIVE THAT CONSTITUTES A NECESSARY LEGITIMISING CONDITION FOR DEMOCRACY. IN LINE WITH THIS ASSUMPTION, HEINZE ADVOCATES A STATE THAT SHOULD PROMOTE PLURALISTIC, ANTI-HATE WORLDVIEWS WITHOUT PUNISHING THOSE CITIZENS WHO REJECT THIS IDEAL. HEINZE LOCATES HIS IDEAL OF FREE PUBLIC DEBATE IN THE HISTORICALLY UNIQUE CONTEXT OF A CONTEMPORARY WELL FUNCTIONING DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY ONE HE COINS AS "LONGSTANDING, STABLE AND PROSPEROUS DEMOCRACY". THE ARTICLE CLAIMED THAT HEINZE'S APPROACH REPRESENTS A GENUINE INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE FOR ANY ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF LEGAL PROHIBITION OF HATE SPEECH ON DEMOCRATIC GROUNDS. HEINZE ALSO COMPELLINGLY DISQUALIFIES A SIMPLISTIC DICHOTOMY OF DEFENDERS AND OPPONENTS OF HATE SPEECH BANS. HOWEVER, IT ALSO CLAIMED THAT HEINZE'S APPROACH SEEMS TO SUFFER FROM TWO SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS. FIRST, IT SEEMS LEGALLY UNFEASIBLE, SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. SECOND, IT SEEMS TO GENERATE AN INHERENT LEGAL INSTABILITY WITH REGARD TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH THAT CONTRADICTS THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN PARTICULAR.
910	THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION OF 1917 ON THE ENTIRE SUBSEQUENT HISTORY OF RUSSIA AND DRAWS A CONCLUSION THAT THE YEAR 1917 WAS A VERY SPECIAL PERIOD NOT ONLY IN THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA, BUT ALSO IN GLOBAL POLITICAL PRACTICE. THE ARTICLE PROVES THE EXISTENCE IN THE RUSSIAN HISTORY OF CERTAIN CRISIS CYCLES, PROVOKED BY THE REVOLUTION. NOW RUSSIA IS FACING BROADER OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CRISIS CYCLES. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT IN RUSSIA THE POLITICAL CULTURE IS GRADUALLY CHANGING NOT ONLY IN FORM, BUT ALSO IN DEEPER CONTENT. A CHALLENGING ASCENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS A MOVEMENT TOWARD A REPUBLICAN POLITICAL CULTURE. HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PEOPLE OF POWER AND PEOPLE OF OPPOSITION TO DEVELOP RESPECT FOR THE REPUBLICAN VALUES, OVERCOMING THE CHRONIC DISEASE OF DISRESPECT FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE, WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC FOR FRANK SUPPORTERS OF AUTHORITARIAN FORMS OF GOVERNMENT SUFFER, AS WELL AS FOR PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES LIBERALS. RUSSIA IS GRADUALLY LEAVING THE OLD RUSSIAN PATH OF THE MOVEMENT FROM AUTHORITARIAN CALM TO TURMOIL, REBELLION, REVOLUTION AND BACK TO THE AUTHORITARIAN ORDER. HOWEVER, THIS PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING POLITICAL CULTURE HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED. THIS WILL REQUIRE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS.
911	TITLING IS OFTEN SEEN AS A PRECONDITION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE RULE OF LAW. BY CONTRAST, CHINESE REAL ESTATE HAS GONE THROUGH A SUBSTANTIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WITHOUT A CADASTER, I.E. IN THE ABSENCE OF REGISTERED RIGHTS TO REALTY. THROUGH A DETAILED REVIEW OF STATE INTERVENTIONS SINCE THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY UNTIL TODAY TWO CRITICAL POINTS WILL BE SUBSTANTIATED. FIRST, IT WILL BE ESTABLISHED THAT THE CHINESE STATE'S TITLING SCHEMES NEVER CAME TO FRUITION. INSTEAD, WE WILL SEE THAT TITLING, AS A FORM OF INSTITUTIONAL INTERVENTION, IS BY DEFINITION A LONG TERM, PROTRACTED PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION AND DISPUTE BETWEEN STATE AND OTHER ACTORS. IN FACT, THE CONTEMPORARY ORIGINS OF CHINESE TITLING CAN BE TRACED TO ALMOST A CENTURY AGO, THE EARLY 1920S. SECOND, IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT CHINESE TITLING REVOLVES AROUND THREE "BATTLEGROUNDS OF BARGAINING" - MAJOR SOURCES OF CONFLICT THAT REQUIRE RESOLUTION OVER TIME: (I) THE STATUS OF STATE AND COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP; (II) THE FRAGMENTED AUTHORITY OVER LAND; AND (III) THE SEPARATION OF LAND FROM HOUSING. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS MAINTAINED THAT THE CADASTER, AS A SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND SPATIAL INSTITUTION, IS THE RESULTANT OF DEVELOPMENT RATHER THAN ITS SINE QUA NON. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

912	IN THE THOUGHT OF THE LEGALISTS, MING IS AN IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY THAT RELATES CLOSELY TO THE GOVERNANCE OF A NATION. MING IS A POLYSEMOUS TERM, WHICH HAS SIX MEANINGS, I.E., FAMOUS, REPUTATION, STATUS, TITULAR, NAME, AND DENOMINATION. THE RESEARCH OBJECT OF THIS PAPER WILL FOCUS ON REPUTATION OF THE MING AS WELL AS STATUS OF THE MING, WHICH ARE THE TWO FORMS OF APPLICATION OF MING. LI MING IS THE FIRST PRIORITY OF THE MONARCH. MING SHI BU CHENG CAN BE EMBODIED IN FOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, I.E, YOU MING WU SHI, MING DUO SHI SHAO, MING SHAO SHI DUO AND SHI FEI QI MING. THE METHOD TO CORRECT MING SHI BU CHENG IS SHEN HE XING MING, WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO XUN MING ZHE SHI AND XUN SHI CHA MING. THE LEGALIST THOUGHT ON MING, ESPECIALLY THE DISCUSSIONS ON MING SHI BU CHENG AND SHEN HE XING MING TOUCH ON SOME ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED BY DIALECTICAL LOGIC, PHILOSOPHY OF LAW, INFORMAL LOGIC AND HISTORY OF LOGIC, SHOWING SOME INNOVATIVE CHARACTER, WHICH WILL BE MEANINGFUL FOR THE THEORETICAL RESEARCH OF RELATED SUBJECTS, AND WHICH CAN ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT GUIDANCE VALUE FOR MANY SOCIAL PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOCIETY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
913	EMER DE VATTEL (1714-1767), IN HIS INFLUENTIAL WORK THE LAW OF NATIONS, ESTABLISHED A NEW INTERNATIONAL STATIST PARADIGM WHICH BROKE WITH THE CLASSICAL PARTITION OF THE LAW INTO THE THREE REALITIES OF PERSONS, THINGS AND ACTIONS (PERSONAE, RES, ACTIONES). THIS NEW PARADIGM SUBSTITUTED THE STATE FOR THE PERSON, DOWNGRADED THE GENERIC CONCEPT OF THINGS TO THE OBLIGATIONS AMONG STATES IN THEIR RELATIONS, AND CHANGED THE FOCUS OF THE CONCEPT OF ACTION TO THAT OF WAR AS A LEGAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS BETWEEN AND AMONG STATES. THIS INTERNATIONAL PARADIGM (OR STATIST PARADIGM), A PRODUCT OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, HAS SURVIVED ALMOST UP TO OUR TIME IN INTERNATIONAL PRAXIS. NONETHELESS, TODAY THE STATIST PARADIGM APPEARS IN EVERY WAY INSUFFICIENT, SINCE IT DOES NOT CONSIDER HUMANITY AS A GENUINE POLITICAL COMMUNITY, NOR DOES IT REFLECT THE THREE-DIMENSIONALITY OF THE GLOBAL LAW PHENOMENON. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LAW THAT GOVERNS OUR INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (INTERNATIONAL LAW) INTO A LAW THAT IS CAPABLE OF PROPERLY ORDERING THE NEW GLOBAL HUMAN COMMUNITY (GLOBAL LAW) DEMANDS THE CREATION OF A NEW PARADIGM, ORIGINATING IN THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTUAL TRIAD: GLOBAL HUMAN COMMUNITY, GLOBAL ISSUES, AND GLOBAL RULE OF LAW. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS NEW GLOBAL PARADIGM, COSMOPOLITAN CONSTITUTIONALISM COULD PLAY A KEY ROLE.
914	LIKE OTHER WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS, AUSTRALIAN LAW IS BASED ON NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. LEGAL FORMALISTIC IDEOLOGY WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT AS LONG AS THE LAW AS IT APPEARS 'ON THE BOOKS, IS APPLIED EQUALLY FOR ALL, JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL. FOR INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, FORMAL EQUALITY MEANS THAT THEIR CLAIMS FOR LAND, COMPENSATION AND THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR CULTURE MUST BE ASSESSED THROUGH THE EYES OF WHITE JUDGES IN WHITE COURTS. EVEN WHEN THOSE JUDGES STRIVE TO APPLY THE LAW EQUALLY, THEY WILL INEVITABLY BE APPLYING EUROCENTRIC BELIEFS AND VALUES. IN TWO RECENT SIGNIFICANT CASES CONCERNING INDIGENOUS CLAIMS FOR THEIR REMOVAL FROM THEIR FAMILIES AS CHILDREN, THOSE BELIEFS AND VALUES HAVE TENDED TO INVALIDATE NOT ONLY THE LEGAL CLAIMS THEMSELVES, BUT ALSO ASPECTS OF THE INDIGENOUS CULTURE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE FORMAL APPLICATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO THESE CLAIMS BY AUSTRALIAN COURTS AND JUDGES LEADS TO THE EXCLUSION OF INDIGENOUS NARRATIVES, WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN BE CONSTRUED AS EVIDENCE OF UNCONSCIOUS RACISM. CHARLES LAWRENCE'S CULTURAL MEANING TEST IS USED TO CRITIQUE THE REASONING OF THE JUDGES IN TWO LEADING AUSTRALIAN CASES CONCERNING THE,STOLEN GENERATION' AND TO EXPOSE THE UNCONSCIOUS RACISM THAT STILL EXISTS IN THE AUSTRALIAN LIBERAL LEGAL SYSTEM.
915	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE ROLE OF THE SPECIFIC STRUCTURE AND CULTURE OF INEQUALITY OF THE COMMUNIST AND POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN THE SIMULTANEOUS WAVE OF ELITE CRIME AND VIOLENT CRIME IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPE. UNDER THE LAYER OF HOMOGENEITY, WHICH HAD BEEN IMPOSED ON THE REGION BY ETHNIC CLEANSING DURING AND AFTER WORLD WAR II AND BY THE CONTINUOUS POLICIES OF COMMUNIST REGIMES, A SUBSTRUCTURE AND SUBCULTURE OF INEQUALITY EMERGED, WHICH BECAME DOMINANT DURING THE TRANSITION PHASE. AMONG THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE "HOUR-GLASS" SOCIETY (ROSE) AND FEUDALIZATION OF SOCIETY ARE CLOSELY KNIT NETWORKS AT THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OF SOCIETY, CLIENTELISM AS A PATTERN OF LINKING THEM, AND NON-EGALITARIAN AND COLLECTIVIST VALUE PATTERNS. THIS SPECIFIC CLUSTER COMBINES FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH HIGH-LEVEL CORRUPTION AND VIOLENCE. PATHWAYS OF DEVELOPMENT DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD INDICATE A BI-PARTITION OF THE "GEOGRAPHY OF CRIME" IN THE REGION. THE RELATIVE "SUCCESS STORIES" OF HUNGARY, POLAND AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC WITH BOTH DECLINING RATES OF CORRUPTION AND LETHAL VIOLENT CRIME (HOMICIDE) ARE IN STARK CONTRAST TO MANY OF THE SUCCESSOR STATES OF THE SOVIET UNION. IT IS ARGUED THAT STRONG INSTITUTIONS BASED ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE.
916	PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM IN BOTH LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES HAS BECOME A HIGH PRIORITY FOR GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR A NEW ROLE FOR THE STATE. COMMON PRINCIPLES HAVE INCLUDED THE OBJECTIVE TO PRIVATIZE, OR CONTRACT OUT SERVICES OR RESPONSIBILITIES WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IMPROVING GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY IN AREAS THAT ARE CONSIDERED CORE GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THESE INCLUDE INTEGRATED GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, SOCIAL SECURITY AND SOCIAL SAFETY NETS, TAX ADMINISTRATION, PROVISION OF BASIC SERVICES (EDUCATION AND HEALTH), LEGAL/REGULATORY REFORM, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT. GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN ALL COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN PREDICTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHILE THE DEGREE OF REFORM HAS VARIED AMONGST COUNTRIES, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THE COMMONWEALTH CARIBBEAN THAT SET ITS PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM EXPERIENCE APART FROM THAT OF LATIN AMERICA. THESE INCLUDE THE LEGACY OF A PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE, LONG-STANDING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND AN ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE OF THE COUNTRIES, AND THE EMPHASIS ON RULE OF LAW THAT CAN HELP EXPLAIN SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE REFORM PATHS TAKEN. NEVERTHELESS, GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN DETERMINING RESULTS WITHIN THE LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN REGION.
917	THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE "ROUND TABLE" ARE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF THE PLACE AND THE ROLE THAT NATIONAL TRADITIONS CAN TAKE AND PLAY IN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF MODERN STATES, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PROCESSES OF GLOBALIZATION AND UNIFICATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE BOUNDARY THAT SEPARATES ACCEPTABLE TRADITIONS FROM UNACCEPTABLE ONES, AS WELL AS THE QUESTION OF WHAT ROLE THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW CAN PLAY IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS.
918	ELECTRICITY THEFT IS A CHRONIC ISSUE AND ENERGY WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS STOLEN ANNUALLY FROM ELECTRICITY GRIDS MAINLY IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS DETERIORATING THE ELECTRICITY THEFT SITUATION USING THE PATH ANALYSIS BY EMPLOYING A MEASUREMENT MODEL IN THE ANALYSIS OF A MOMENT STRUCTURES (AMOS). PRECEDING THE PATH ANALYSIS, STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS) IS USED FOR DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, RELIABILITY ANALYSIS THROUGH CRONBACH'S ALPHA TEST, AND EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS THROUGH KMO & BARLETT'S TEST OF SPHERICITY. THE STUDY ANALYSES THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATE THE ILLEGAL CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY IN THE SERVICE AREA OF ISLAMABAD ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY, PAKISTAN, UTILIZING A PRIMARY DATASET COLLECTED THROUGH A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE FROM THE TWIN CITIES OF ISLAMABAD AND RAWALPINDI. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON PERCEPTION OF THE CONSUMERS. THE FACTORS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THEFT INCLUDE CORRUPTION DILUTING DETERRENCE AND POWER OUTAGES/LOAD SHEDDING, WHEREAS THE AGE OF THE RESPON-DENT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THEIR PERCEPTION TOWARDS ELECTRICITY THEFT. THE ROLE OF ELECTRICITY TARIFF RATE, ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION PATTERN, PROBABILITY OF DETECTION, THE RULE OF LAW, EDUCATION OF THE RESPONDENT AND QUALITY OF CONDUCT OF UTILITY OFFICIALS APPEARED INSIGNIFICANT IN MOTIVATING CONSUMERS TO STEAL ELECTRICITY.
919	THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY DWELLING ON THE FORMS AND CAUSES OF WESTERN "HISTORICAL NIHILISM" TOWARD THE CHINESE SOCIALIST PROJECT. I THEN ANALYZE ISSUES ATTENDANT TO DENG'S APPEAL TO "LIBERATING THOUGHT," PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORCES OF PRODUCTION AND THE DILEMMAS THIS PRESENTS FOR SOCIALISTS. THIS SEGUES INTO A DISCUSSION OF CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS, WHICH IS THEORETICALLY CENTRAL IN BOER'S BOOK. THROUGH THE DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENCE OF SUCH ANALYSIS FROM FORMS OF "EITHER/OR" LOGIC DOMINANT IN THE WEST, I ARRIVE AT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CATEGORY OF THE "CONCRETE UNIVERSAL" (HEGEL) FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF "SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS." AFTER UNPACKING SOME OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES POSED BY THE "REFORM AND OPENING-UP," I DWELL ON THE QUESTION OF SOCIALISM IN CHINA. I EMPHASIZE SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS INHERENT IN THE COMBINATION OF SOCIALIST PLANNING AND THE MARKET ECONOMY, INCLUDING THE ISSUE OF THE CONCEPTION OF A FUTURE OR PROSPECTIVE "COMMUNIST" STAGE. THE DISCUSSION CONCLUDES BY DWELLING ON ISSUES OF LAW AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE INNOVATIVE IMPORTANCE OF "RULE OF LAW" IN THE SOCIALIST CONTEXT, AS WELL AS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTRADICTION ANALYSIS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE DIALECTIC OF SOVEREIGNTY AND GLOBALIZATION.
920	THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO DISCUSS THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN CONTEMPORARY INDONESIA. THIS STUDY IS ESSENTIAL SINCE INDONESIA IS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES TRANSITIONING FROM AUTHORITARIANISM TOWARDS DEMOCRACY FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SUHARTO'S REGIME. THIS STUDY SHALL ANSWER WHETHER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN INDONESIA EXPERIENCES A CRISIS, WITH A FOCUS OF ANALYSIS ON THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, NAMELY: (1) RULE OF LAW, (2) HUMAN RIGHTS, (3) CIVIL SOCIETY, AND (4) ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL PROCESS. THIS STUDY APPLIES A QUALITATIVE METHOD BY COLLECTING DATA FROM DOCUMENT STUDIES AND LITERARY STUDIES. THE FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN INDONESIA EXPERIENCES A CRISIS AS EVIDENCED BY THE REMAINING-WEAK LEGAL SUPREMACY IN INDONESIA, AND THE EXISTENCE OF VIOLATIONS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, EVENTUALLY LED TO HORIZONTAL CONFLICTS. THE INABILITY OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS TO CARRY OUT THEIR FUNCTIONS IN DEMOCRATIZATION AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE STATE AS WELL AS TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST. ANOTHER RECENT WEAKNESS IS THERE ARE STILL STRONG ISSUES RELATED TO PRIMORDIALISM IN THE OCCASION OF GENERAL ELECTIONS. THIS CRISIS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE SHALL BRING INDONESIA TO "THE DECLINE OF DEMOCRACY" INSTEAD OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION.
921	SINCE 2017, THE UNITED STATES (US) AND OTHER WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) MEMBERS HAVE BEEN VIOLATING THEIR LEGAL DUTIES AND DEMOCRATIC MANDATES GIVEN BY NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS TO MAINTAIN THE WTO APPELLATE BODY (AB) AS LEGALLY PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 17 OF THE WTO DISPUTE UNDERSTANDING (DSU). ARTICLE 17 DEFINES THE AB AS BEING 'COMPOSED OF SEVEN PERSONS', WITH VACANCIES BEING 'FILLED AS THEY ARISE'. SECTIONS 2 AND 3 EXPLAIN WHY NONE OF THE REASONS OFFERED BY THE US FOR ITS BLOCKING OF THE (RE)APPOINTMENT OF AB CANDIDATES - ON GROUNDS UNRELATED TO THE PERSONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF THE CANDIDATES - CAN JUSTIFY THE ILLEGAL DISRUPTIONS OF THE WTO LEGAL AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM. EU TRADE DIPLOMATS MUST EXERCISE LEADERSHIP USING THE EXISTING LEGAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE WTO MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE AND GENERAL COUNCIL UNDER ARTICLE IX WTO - IF NECESSARY, BASED ON 'A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST' - TO COMPLETE THE WTO SELECTION PROCEDURES FOR FILLING AB VACANCIES AND PROTECT THE AB AS LEGALLY DEFINED IN ARTICLE 17 DSU. SECTIONS 4 AND 5 EXPLAIN WHY THE COMPETITION, SOCIAL POLICY, AND RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING EUROPEAN 'ORDO-LIBERALISM' OFFER COHERENT STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING THE WTO GOVERNANCE CRISES BY LIMITING HEGEMONIC ABUSES OF BOTH US NEO-LIBERALISM AND CHINESE STATE-CAPITALISM.
922	THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE ARGUMENTS AND COUNTERARGUMENTS WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION ON THE ISSUE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND INSTITUTIONS QUALITY. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL WHICH INCORPORATES MACROECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES IN A SAMPLE OF 187 COUNTRIES OBSERVED DURING THE PERIOD 2002-2015. SYSTEMATIZATION LITERARY SOURCES AND APPROACHES FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF THE DIFFERENCE OF INSTITUTIONS QUALITY AND VALUES OF ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE INDEX. METHODOLOGICAL TOOLS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS WERE 14 YEARS OF RESEARCH CONTAIN 48 DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND 139 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE USED DYNAMIC PANEL DATA MODELS AND ESPECIALLY THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM) ESTIMATOR OF ARELLANO AND BOVER (1995). THE RESEARCH EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMS AND THEORETICALLY PROVES THAT THE LEVEL OF GROWTH PROXIED BY THE GDPG EXERTS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE LEVEL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, (REPRESENTED BY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW AND ACT), ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE FOR THE WHOLE SAMPLE. THEN, WE PROVE THAT A GOOD INSTITUTIONS QUALITY ENHANCE A SIGNIFICANTLY ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH CAN BE USEFUL FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INDICATE THAT ALL VARIABLES REFLECTED INSTITUTION QUALITIES DECREASED THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE EXCEPT FOR THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS WHICH EXERTS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.
923	WHEN THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY VOTED IN 2007 TO ADOPT THE DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (UNDRIP), ONLY AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND AND THE USA CAST NEGATIVE VOTES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EMBEDDING OF INDIGENOUS JURISDICTIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS OF THESE STATES VIA NEGOTIATED POLITICAL AGREEMENTS LIMITS THEIR CAPACITY TO ACCEPT CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE UNDRIP. ONCE THE AGREEMENT-MAKING PROCESS IS SET IN MOTION, RIGHTS THAT DO NOT DERIVE FROM THOSE BARGAINS THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THEM. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF SELF-GOVERNANCE AND COLLECTIVE PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH ARE CORPORATE RIGHTS VESTED TO HISTORICALLY CONTINUOUS INDIGENOUS GROUPS. SINCE THESE RIGHTS CANNOT EASILY BE RECONCILED WITH THE EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERPIN MAINSTREAM HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, SETTLER GOVERNMENTS MUST NAVIGATE TWO MODES OF LIBERALISM: THE FIRST DIRECTED TO THE CONDUCT OF PROSPECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SECOND DIRECTED TO THE REPARATIVE GOAL OF PROPERLY CONSTITUTING A SETTLER BODY POLITIC AND COMPLETING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SETTLER STATE BY ACQUIRING INDIGENOUS CONSENT. AGREEMENTS HELP TO NAVIGATE THIS TENSION, BY INSULATING INDIGENOUS AND HUMAN RIGHTS REGIMES FROM ONE ANOTHER, ALBEIT IN WAYS NOT ALWAYS SUPPORTED BY THE UNDRIP.
924	MODERN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW ARE SCARCE IN DOCTRINAL REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING INEQUITIES IN THE SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ARGUMENT FOR INVIGORATING THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE AND RETHINKING ITS RELEVANCE FOR ADDRESSING THE ISSUES OF RACE, INEQUALITY, AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TRADITIONALLY CONCERNED WITH THE CLARITY OF LAWS TO PROVIDE FAIR WARNING OF PROHIBITED CONDUCT, THE VAGUENESS DOCTRINE EXPERIENCED A MARKED TRANSFORMATION WHEN THE SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZED A MORE SUBSTANTIVE VALUE UNDERLYING VAGUENESS PREVENTING DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE EMERGENCE OF THE EQUALITY RATIONALE FOR VAGUENESS AND LINKS THE ASCENDANCE OF THIS STRAND WITH THE GROWING EGALITARIANISM OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA. FROM THERE, THE DOCTRINE WAS SOON GRAFTED TO MORE TRADITIONAL EQUAL PROTECTION CONCERNS. WHILE REMAINING A DOCTRINE ROOTED IN DUE PROCESS AND RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES, THE VAGUENESS DOCTRINE BECAME AN ALTERNATE MEANS OF ACHIEVING EQUALITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF LIBERTY. IN SOME WAYS, IT OFFERS A MORE EFFICACIOUS DOCTRINAL INSTRUMENT THAN MODERN EQUAL PROTECTION LAW FOR CONFRONTING INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. ACCORDINGLY, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES REFORMS TO THE COURT'S CURRENT VAGUENESS JURISPRUDENCE TO MAXIMIZE ITS CAPACITY FOR REDRESSING INEQUALITY IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF CRIMINAL LAWS.
925	THERE IS CURRENTLY MUCH INTEREST IN THE QUESTION WHETHER A GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS COMING INTO BEING AND, IF SO, WHETHER THIS IS DESIRABLE OR OTHERWISE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF PRINCIPLES FOR A GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT CONSIDERS FOUR POTENTIAL SOURCES AND THEIR SUITABILITY AS A FOUNDATION FOR A GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SYSTEM: FIRST, THE LARGELY PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE EMERGED IN NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SYSTEMS, NOTABLY THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND DUE PROCESS PRINCIPLES (SECTION 3); SECOND, THE SET OF RULE OF LAW VALUES, PROMOTED BY PROPONENTS OF FREE TRADE AND ECONOMIC LIBERALISM (SECTION 4); THIRD, THE GOOD GOVERNANCE VALUES, AND MORE PARTICULARLY TRANSPARENCY, PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY, PROMOTED BY THE WORLD BANK AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (SECTION 5); AND FINALLY, HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES (SECTION 6). THE PAPER ENDS ON A SCEPTICAL NOTE, CONCLUDING THAT A UNIVERSAL SET OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PRINCIPLES IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY AND NOT ESPECIALLY DESIRABLE. FIRST, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS PRIMARILY A WESTERN CONSTRUCT, PROTECTIVE OF WESTERN INTERESTS. IT MAY IMPACT UNFAVOURABLY ON DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. SECONDLY, THE EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN ADJUDICATIVE FORUMS IS LEADING TO AN UNDESIRABLE 'JURIDIFICATION OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS'. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT DIVERSITY AND PLURALISM ARE PREFERABLE.
926	FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY RELATIONS WERE INSTITUTIONALIZED AFTER WORLD WAR II AS A SET OF LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT THAT FORMED THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND CONTAIN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE RULES OF GOOD CONDUCT FOR IMF MEMBERS. MEMBERS WERE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A PAR VALUE FOR THEIR CURRENCY (UNTIL 1977), TO USE A SINGLE UNIFIED EXCHANGE-RATE SYSTEM, AND TO KEEP THEIR CURRENT ACCOUNT FREE FROM RESTRICTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE I EXPLORE WHY GOVERNMENTS COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO THESE RULES AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY COMPLIED WITH THEIR COMMITMENTS. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENTS TENDED TO MAKE AND KEEP COMMITMENTS IF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THEIR REGION DID SO AS WELL. GOVERNMENTS ALSO COMPLIED WITH THEIR INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMITMENTS IF THE REGIME PLACED A HIGH VALUE ON THE RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY. ONE INFERENCE IS THAT REPUTATIONAL CONCERNS HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMITMENTS AND COMPLIANCE. COUNTRIES THAT HAVE INVESTED IN A STRONG REPUTATION FOR PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO SEE IT JEOPARDIZED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATIONS. VIOLATION IS MORE LIKELY, HOWEVER, IN THE FACE OF WIDESPREAD NONCOMPLIANCE, SUGGESTING THAT COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN ITS REGIONAL CONTEXT.
927	EPIDEMIC SHOCKS HAVE BROUGHT THE ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY TO THE FORE. FURTHERMORE, AN URGENT NEED TO ESTABLISH A LONG-TERM MECHANISM TO PARTICULARLY HELP LOW-INCOME GROUPS COPE WITH RISK SHOCKS, AND MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THEREFORE, BASED ON CHFS PANEL TRACKING DATA IN 2015, 2017, AND 2019, THE IMPACT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE ON HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY AND ITS MECHANISM OF ACTION IS EMPIRICALLY TESTED. WE FOUND THAT FOR EVERY 10% INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE, THE PROBABILITY OF ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY OCCURRING IN THE HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY DECREASES BY 2.81 PERCENTAGE POINTS BECAUSE THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE RAISES THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME LEVEL OF LOW-INCOME GROUPS, IMPROVES THE HEALTH STATUS OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS, AND INCREASE THEIR COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE, EMERGENCY SAVINGS AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL STOCK. THIS IMPACT IS MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR RURAL HOUSEHOLDS, HOUSEHOLDS IN AREAS WITH HIGH MARKETIZATION LEVELS, BETTER RULE OF LAW LEVELS AND WITH LOW EDUCATION LEVELS. THE ARTICLE'S RESEARCH HELPS TO COMPREHENSIVELY ANALYSE THE WELFARE EFFECTS OF MINIMUM WAGE POLICIES AND EXPAND THE POLICY OPTIONS FOR HELPING LOW-INCOME GROUPS COPE WITH RISK SHOCKS.(C) 2023 ECONOMIC SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA, QUEENSLAND.

928	THE LEGITIMACY OF DEMOCRACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS IS BASED UPON LAWS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. THE PRESENCE OF A LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ITS APPLICATION BY BUREAUCRATS IN THEIR DAILY DECISIONS ARE PREREQUISITES FOR THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THIS EXPLAINS WHY, IN CONTEXTS OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING, LEGAL FRAMEWORKS ARE UNDER ATTACK. SCHOLARS OBSERVED THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING, BUT THERE IS STILL A GAP IN UNDERSTANDING THE DISPUTES AROUND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. HERE, WE ANALYZE THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS AROUND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN A CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. ANALYZING THE CASE OF BRAZIL UNDER BOLSONARO'S GOVERNMENT, WE DRAW ON 164 INTERVIEWS WITH BUREAUCRATS TO UNDERSTAND HOW BOTH BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS DISPUTE THE LEGITIMACY, USES, AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ATTACK OR PROTECT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND CIVIL RIGHTS. ON ONE SIDE, BUREAUCRATS DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR LEGITIMACY THROUGH EXISTING RULES AND PROCEDURES. ON THE OTHER SIDE, POLITICIANS CHANGE OR REINTERPRET THE RULES TO FRAGILIZE BUREAUCRATS' DECISIONS. IN THIS PROCESS, BOTH POLITICIANS AND BUREAUCRATS LEARN HOW TO IMPROVE THEIR STRATEGIES AROUND THE USES OF LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. THESE FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING HOW THE DYNAMICS AROUND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK EXPLAIN PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING.
929	THIS PAPER TAKES THE GOVERNMENT TRANSITION THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 2022 AND 2023 IN BRAZIL AS A CASE STUDY AND AIMS TO ANALYSE HOW A CYCLE OF RADICAL RIGHT-WING POPULIST GOVERNMENT ACTED TO DISMANTLE BRAZIL'S NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOUNDATIONS. IT DESCRIBES HOW GOVERNANCE WAS BUILT BASED ON POLITICAL-CLIENTELISM AND MARKET-PRIVATISING INTERESTS AND ON THE ADOPTION OF LONG-TERM FISCAL AUSTERITY POLICIES, WHOSE RESULTS ARE PUBLIC DEFUNDING AND WEAKENING AND DISORGANISATION OF THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM, WITH A SIGNIFICANT WORSENING OF HEALTH INDICATORS AND THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO THE POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS. THE LESSONS FROM RECENT EXPERIENCE IN BRAZIL SHOULD SERVE AS LEARNING AND A SOURCE OF ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL REFLECTION, SINCE THERE IS AN ONGOING INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT AND SIGNS OF RISE OF RADICAL RIGHT-WING POPULIST REGIMES IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, WHICH ENDANGER THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONS, AND SOCIAL POLICIES. IT ALLOWS PUTTING INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW POLITICAL CYCLES OF THIS NATURE CAN AFFECT NATIONAL UNIVERSAL HEALTH SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE. KEEPING IN MIND THE BRAZILIAN EXPERIENCE, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE THE PROGRESSIVE STRUCTURING OF A RADICAL RIGHT-WING NEO-POPULISM AND IN THE SANITARIAN.
930	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE CONTENT AND ESSENCE OF THE ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY AS A TOOL FOR COUNTERING CORRUPTION CRIME IN UKRAINE. RESEARCH RESULTS. IT IIIS ESTABLISHED THAT ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY SHOULD INCLUDE A NUMBER OF BASIC MEASURES TO COUNTER CRIME IN THE FIELD OF ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, THE POSITION THAT THE PREPARATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF THE CORRESPONDING DOCUMENT IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INDICATORS, WHICH SHOULD BE COLLECTED IN ADVANCE, ACCORDING TO DEFINED CRITERIA AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME, IS SUBSTANTIATED. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE PRACTICAL METHOD OF DETERMINING THE MAIN PRIORITIES IN THE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY OF UKRAINE AND THE USE OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AS THE MAIN TOOL. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. IT IS ARGUED THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING IN THE STATE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY AND THE SPECIFIC FORM OF ITS MANIFESTATION - ADOPTION OF THE STATE ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES - HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE PROVISION OF HUMAN AND CITIZEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE FUNCTIONING OF ALL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE.
931	REGULATORY ARBITRAGE - THE FORMAL COMPLIANCE WITH RULES WHILE VIOLATING THEIR VERY SPIRIT - IS A PERSISTENT PRACTICE IN DAILY BUSINESS AND SUBJECT OF PERPETUAL EFFORTS OF REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. FOCUSING ON BOTH, THE PRACTICE OF REGULATORY ARBITRAGE AS WELL AS ATTEMPT OF REGULATORS AND RULE-MAKERS SEEKING TO CONTAIN IT, THE ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE PROVIDE A WELL-ROUNDED, DIALECTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON. IN THIS VEIN, FRIEDRICH ZOOMS IN ON THE CONSTRUCT OF SYNTHETIC LEASING AS AN EXAMPLE OF A PRODUCT, PLACED IN ZONES OF REGULATORY OVERLAP BETWEEN TAX AND ACCOUNTING TO ACHIEVE THE MOST BENEFICIAL TREATMENT. KUNKEL DISCUSSES THE POLITICAL DIMENSION OF THE CONCEPTUAL UNDERPINNINGS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND HOW THEY ARE LINKED TO REGULATORY ARBITRAGE IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. STANESCU AND BOGDAN FOCUS ON TAX SHELTERING IN ROMANIAN DEBT COLLECTING SCHEMES, JUST AS LANGENBUCHER EXPLORES THE LIMITS OF CONSTRAINING SUCH PRACTICES PROVIDED BY THE NEED TO GRANT A HIGH DEGREE OF LEGAL SECURITY, AS ENSHRINED IN THE RULE OF LAW. LASTLY, THIEMANN AND TROEGER INQUIRE INTO HOW SUPERVISORS CAN KEEP UP WITH FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS FOR REGULATORY ARBITRAGE IN THE SHADOW BANKING SECTOR, SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR A FLEXIBLE INTERPRETATION OF RULES AND CLOSE EXCHANGE WITH THE REGULATED AND THEIR REGULATORY ADVISORS TO CONTROL THEIR ROLE BENDING BEHAVIOR.
932	MANY PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES BECAUSE THEY ARE LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC. YET IT WOULD BE MISTAKEN, INDEED NAIVE, TO ASSUME THAT THIS APPLIES TO ALL WOULD-BE RESIDENTS. JUST AS SOME INHABITANTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES OPPOSE ONE OR MORE FUNDAMENTAL LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND PRINCIPLES (E.G. THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOMS OF CONSCIENCE AND SPEECH, RIGHTS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY AND TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION), SO THERE ARE FOREIGN WOULD-BE RESIDENTS WHO DO SO, WHO MIGHT INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WITH E.G. JIHADIST, NEO-NAZI, AND RADICAL ANARCHIST VIEWS. PROCEEDING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE EXISTS NO UNCONDITIONAL MORAL RIGHT TO IMMIGRATE, THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHETHER IT IS EVER MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES TO DENY RESIDENCE TO NONNATIONALS BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THEYPERSONALLYHOLD EXTREMIST VIEWS. I ARGUE THAT THIS IS SOMETIMES THE CASE. SPECIFICALLY, MY CONTENTION IS THAT EVEN IF WE ADOPT A COSMOPOLITAN PERSPECTIVE ON WHICH STATES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PRIORITISE THE INTERESTS OF THEIR OWN CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS OVER THOSE OF FOREIGN NONRESIDENTS, THERE ARE TWO CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH EXCLUSIONS ARE JUSTIFIED EVEN WHEN REFUGEES ARE BEING REFUSED ADMISSION (ALTHOUGH, AS I SUGGEST, STATES MIGHT BE MORALLY REQUIRED IN SUCH CASES TO ADMIT OTHER REFUGEES INSTEAD).
933	ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICTS HAVE BEEN A TOP GLOBAL FOCUS AND ISSUE FOR HUMAN'S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. CHINA IS CONFRONTED WITH A SERIOUS SITUATION WITH A RIGID DEMAND OF ECOLOGICAL GOVERNANCE, IN WHICH THE NOT IN MY BACK YARD (NIMBY) CRISIS OUTBREAKS FREQUENTLY. NIMBY HAS A GREAT IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL STABILITY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE NIMBY CRISIS TRANSFORMATION PATH FOR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE INCINERATION (MSWI) IN CHINA. CONSIDERING ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INFLUENCES, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO FIND METHODS OF TRANSFORMING DANGERS INTO OPPORTUNITIES. A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR REALIZING THE NIMBY CRISIS TRANSFORMATION IN WASTE MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING WAS CONDUCTED WITH A HYBRID APPROACH. A FISHBONE DIAGRAM WAS APPLIED TO EXPLAIN THE KEY FACTORS OF NIMBY CRISIS TRANSFORMATION FOR MSWI. INTEGRATING BAYESIAN NETWORK STRUCTURE DISCOVERY AND CO-WORD ANALYSIS INTO A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, SEARCHED DATA AND KEY FACTORS FROM A LITERATURE SEARCH ENGINE WITH SPECIFIC THEMES WERE USED FOR STRUCTURE LEARNING. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PROJECT LOCATION, BENEFIT COMPENSATION, PUBLICITY AND EDUCATION, PUBLIC DECISION, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, THE RULE OF LAW AND MULTIPLE GOVERNANCE HAVE DISTINCT INFLUENCES ON THE NIMBY CRISIS TRANSFORMATION PROCESS IN CHINA.

934	IDENTIFYING THE ROBUST DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION AMONG CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, INSTITUTIONAL, AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER INHERENT, LARGELY UNCHANGEABLE ATTRIBUTES ARE RESPONSIBLE OR IF INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC ATTRIBUTES ARE AT WORK. ACCOUNTING FOR MODEL UNCERTAINTY, WE USE BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING (BMA) TO ANALYZE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF 36 POTENTIAL CORRUPTION DETERMINANTS ACROSS 123 COUNTRIES (COVERING 87 PERCENT OF THE WORLD POPULATION). THE BMA METHODOLOGY SORTS THROUGH ALL 68,719,476,736 POSSIBLE MODEL COMBINATIONS (2(36)) IN ORDER TO CARVE OUT THE ROBUST CORRELATES. WE THEN TAKE A STEP TOWARD ALLEVIATING ENDOGENEITY CONCERNS IN AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE BMA FRAMEWORK. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT CULTURAL FACTORS ARE LARGELY IRRELEVANT, WHEREAS PARTICULAR ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS MATTER. THE RULE OF LAW EMERGES AS THE MOST PERSISTENT PREDICTOR WITH A POSTERIOR INCLUSION PROBABILITY (PIP) IN THE TRUE MODEL OF 1.00, WHEREAS WE FIND STRONG EVIDENCE FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (PIP OF 0.88), URBANIZATION (0.85), AND THE SHARE OF WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT (0.80) AS MEANINGFUL DETERMINANTS OF LOWER CORRUPTION LEVELS. IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE EXTENT OF PRIMARY SCHOOLING ENTERS AS A POWERFUL FACTOR WITH A PIP OF 1.00. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
935	THE APPROACH TO SENTENCING DETERMINATIONS IN AUSTRALIA IS TERMED THE "INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS". THIS INVOLVES A LARGELY DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENT WHEREBY COURTS DETERMINE ALL RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN PRESCRIBE A DESIGNATED PENALTY. THE HALLMARK OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT COURTS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO SET OUT THE WEIGHT THAT IS ACCORDED TO ANY PARTICULAR CONSIDERATION. INSTEAD, A GLOBAL JUDGMENT IS MADE REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE PENALTY. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR LACKING IN TRANSPARENCY AND CONSISTENCY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EMPIRICAL TESTING OF SUCH ASSERTIONS. THIS ARTICLE ADDS TO THE LITERATURE IN THIS AREA BY REPORTING THE FINDINGS OF A WIDE-RANGING STUDY INTO SENTENCING OUTCOMES FOR DRIVING OFFENCES IN FOUR COURTS IN VICTORIA. THE STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT RELATES TO OVER 12,000 SENTENCING DETERMINATIONS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD AND COMPARES SENTENCING OUTCOMES IN A SINGLE JURISDICTION - WHERE IDENTICAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES OPERATE. IT NOTES THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF INCONSISTENCY REGARDING SENTENCING OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE COURTS, WITH THE USE OF IMPRISONMENT IN ONE COURT THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN IN ANOTHER. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY CAST DOUBT OVER THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS APPROACH, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SECURING THE RULE OF LAW VIRTUES OF CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY.
936	ACCORDING TO EUROPEAN REGULATIONS AND THE LEGISLATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES, CHILDREN WHO SEEK ASYLUM HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF RIGHTS THAN ADULTS IN A SIMILAR POSITION. TO PROTECT THESE RIGHTS AND ENSURE RULE OF LAW, MIGRATION AUTHORITIES ARE COMMONLY REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE AGE OF ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO LACK RELIABLE DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDICAL METHODS. HOWEVER, MANY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER COMMENTATORS CONSIDER MEDICAL AGE ASSESSMENT TO BE ETHICALLY PROBLEMATIC. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SIMPLIFIED AND AMENDED ACCOUNT OF THE MAIN FINDINGS OF A RECENT ETHICAL ANALYSIS OF MEDICAL AGE ASSESSMENT IN THE ASYLUM PROCESS COMMISSIONED BY THE SWEDISH NATIONAL BOARD OF HEALTH AND WELFARE. A NUMBER OF ETHICAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO CONFLICTING GOALS, EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS, AUTONOMY AND INFORMED CONSENT, PRIVACY AND INTEGRITY, AND PROFESSIONAL VALUES AND ROLES ARE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYSED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT MOST OF THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE MET, BUT THAT THIS REQUIRES A SYSTEM WHERE THE ASSESSMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE AND WHERE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE. TWO IMPORTANT ETHICAL QUESTIONS ARE FOUND TO WARRANT FURTHER ANALYSIS. THE FIRST IS WHETHER ASYLUM SEEKERS' CONSENT TO THE PROCEDURE CAN BE CONSIDERED GENUINELY VOLUNTARY. THE SECOND IS WHETHER AND HOW MEDICAL AGE ASSESSMENTS COULD AFFECT NEGATIVE PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS ASYLUM SEEKERS OR DISCRIMINATORY SOCIETAL VIEWS MORE GENERALLY.
937	OUR PURPOSE IN THIS FOREWORD ARTICLE IS TO REVISIT, UPDATE, AND THEORETICALLY REVISE MAURO CAPPELLETTI'S PATH-BREAKING WORK JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD. OUR MAIN CARTOGRAPHICAL DEVICE, IN HOMAGE TO CAPPELLETTI, IS THE WAVE METAPHOR. WE MAP THREE SEQUENTIAL AND OVERLAPPING WORLDWIDE, GLOBAL WAVES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW WITHIN A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE FIRST WAVE IS THE SERIES OF "CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTIONS" WITHIN NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. THE SECOND WAVE IS THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS THE SOURCE OF THE HIGHER LAW WHICH COURTS USE IN THEIR EXERCISE OF THEIR POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE THIRD WAVE IS A RESPONSE AND REACTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND WAVES: ONE DIMENSION OF THE THIRD WAVE IS THE ATTEMPT OF DOMESTIC COURTS TO MAKE UP FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC AND IDENTITARIAN LACUNAE IN TRANSNATIONAL GOVERNANCE (VOICE). ANOTHER DIMENSION-EXIT-IS THE SET OF INSTANCES IN WHICH COURTS (AND STATES) SEEK TO EXIT THE FIRST AND/OR THE SECOND WAVE. THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE WAVES AND THEIR DIALECTICAL FEATURES CONSTITUTE THE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK WE OFFER IN THIS ARTICLE. BY HIGHLIGHTING THE DIALECTICAL RELATIONS WITHIN AND BETWEEN WAVES WE HOPE TO CHALLENGE A DOMINANT NARRATIVE ON CONSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESSES AS PROGRESSIVE AND EVOLUTIONARY.
938	THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMON AND UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE UNITED NATIONS' SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) REQUIRES DIFFERENTIATED GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS AT ALL LEVELS, AS IT FALLS SHORT TO USE ONE GOVERNANCE STYLE ONLYHIERARCHICAL, NETWORK OR MARKET GOVERNANCEOR ANY ONE STYLE COMBINATION THAT IS BELIEVED TO BE FIT-FOR-ALL-PURPOSES. THE ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF COMMON BUT DIFFERENTIATED GOVERNANCE (CBDG) AND ILLUSTRATES HOW THIS PRINCIPLE CAN MAKE THE SDGS WORK. IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT, AFTER MORE THAN 15 YEARS' EXPERIENCE WITH THE CONCEPT OF METAGOVERNANCE (HOW TO COMBINE DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE STYLES INTO SUCCESSFUL GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS), THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME CONVERGENCE TOWARDS USING THIS AS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ACHIEVE SITUATIONALLY APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE HAVE ELABORATED HOW POLICY MAKERS COULD USE METAGOVERNANCE, COMBINED WITH KEY GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES, AS MECHANISM TO SUPPORT ANALYSIS, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF SDG GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS, TO MAKE FAILURES NOTICED, AND TO SUGGEST MITIGATION MEASURES. METAGOVERNANCE RESPECTS COMMON PRINCIPLES LIKE RULE OF LAW, BUT TAKES AS STARTING POINT THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE THEM. A POSSIBLE STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH FOR SDG IMPLEMENTATION WITH METAGOVERNANCE IS PROPOSED, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING GOVERNANCE SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSIST PROCESS DESIGN, REVIEW, MONITORING AND EVALUATION, AT LEAST AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.
939	COMMUNAL LAND TITLING OF INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN CAMBODIA THROUGH A MORE PARTICIPATORY APPROACH MAY BE THE BEST WAY FOR COMMUNITIES TO SECURE TENURE RIGHTS. INVESTMENTS, LAND DISPUTES AND DISPLACEMENT ARE ON THE RISE IN CAMBODIA. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN RATANAKIRI PROVINCE INHABIT SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST NATURAL RESOURCE-RICH AREAS, MAKING THEIR LAND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO INVESTMENT PROJECTS. ECONOMIC LAND CONCESSIONS (ELCS) ARE THE MOST WIDESPREAD FORM OF LAND ACQUISITION BY INVESTORS, OFTEN GRANTED BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OVER LAND THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE TRADITIONALLY OWN AND USE. INTERACTIONS INVOLVING THREATS, COERCION, AND INADEQUATE COMPENSATION WERE COMMON BETWEEN INVESTORS AND COMMUNITIES, IN PART DUE TO LACK OF RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. COMMUNAL LAND TITLES ARE A FORM OF LAND OWNERSHIP FORMALISATION ALLOWING INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES TO OWN ALL OF THEIR LAND WITH A SINGLE TITLE-AN ATTEMPT BY GOVERNMENT TO FACILITATE TENURE SECURITY AND BETTER INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH NEARLY ALL INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE STUDY EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO OBTAIN COMMUNAL TITLES, NGOS AND GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED TITLING PROCESSES IN A TOP-DOWN MANNER THAT DID NOT ENGAGE OR EMPOWER THEM. THE FOCUS DURING TITLING PROCESSES SHOULD TURN TO COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND ENGAGEMENT; MERE TITLE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SECURE CUSTOMARY TENURE RIGHTS.
940	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DISCUSS THE POSITION OF THE BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT, BY ANALYZING THE JUDGMENTS RELATED TO THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND PUBLIC BUDGET DURING 2011. IT SEEKS TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: DURING THE YEAR 2011, AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS SINCE THE PROMULGATION OF THE BRAZILIAN 1988 CONSTITUTION (WHICH ESTABLISHED THE BUDGET RULES IN OUR COUNTRY) AND MORE THAN 10 YEARS OF THE BRAZILIAN FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT, THE EXTENT TO WHICH JUDICIAL DECISIONS WITH THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES DO NOT MEET THE BUDGET LAWS AND MAY THUS JEOPARDIZE THE HEALTH BUDGET AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PLANNED UNIVERSAL HEALTH POLICY? TO ELABORATE THIS PAPER WAS DEVELOPED BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND DOCUMENTAL RESEARCH BASED ON THE LITERATURE RELATED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHT TO HEALTH, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE LITERATURE RELATED TO THE PHENOMENON OF THE JUDICIALIZATION OF HEALTH AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PUBLIC FINANCES IN BRAZIL, AFTER THE 1988 CONSTITUTION. SUPREME COURT'S DECISIONS DURING THE YEAR OF 2011 WERE ALSO SURVEYED AT THE COURT'S WEBSITE, USING THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS: "RIGHT", "HEALTH", "BUDGET" AND "ART. 196". THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE WAY SUPREME COURT HAS DECIDED THESE ISSUES AND POINTS TO THE NEED OF MORE DISCUSSION AND INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND PUBLIC BUDGET.
941	THE THESIS OF THIS COMMENTARY IS THAT THE INSTITUTION OF WAR COULD BE ABOLISHED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMES AND OBSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMES. GOOD WORKS ALONE WON'T END WAR. TO TRANSFORM DOMINATOR, WARRING CULTURES INTO EGALITARIAN AND NONWARRING ONES, CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMES ARE NEEDED TO PREPARE THE WAY, TO ESTABLISH THE GROUNDWORK FOR A NEW LIFESTYLE. BUT, ALONE, THEY WILL NOT RESULT IN A PARADIGM SHIFT ON EARTH TO A GENE RODDENBERRY-STYLE STAR TREK FUTURE IN WHICH THERE IS GENDER AND RACIAL EQUALITY, POVERTY HAS BEEN ELIMINATED AND CONFLICTS ARE RESOLVED BY THE RULE OF LAW INSTEAD OF THROUGH MILITARY FORCE. PARADOXICALLY, UNLESS PAIRED WITH THE FORCE OF OBSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMES, CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAMMES CAN ENABLE DOMINATOR CULTURES TO REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE. MOREOVER, TO BRING ABOUT A MAJOR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION, WE WILL NEED LEADERS TO UNITE MEN AND WOMEN AS FULL PARTNERS IN SHAPING A MASSIVE CULTURAL SHIFT TO A MORE EGALITARIAN, JUST AND NONWARRING FUTURE. CAN THE PEOPLE OF EARTH BRING AN END TO THE BARBARIC PRACTICE OF WAR? OR IS MAKING WAR ASSEMBLING ARMED GROUPS THAT GO FORTH TO INDISCRIMINATELY KILL MEMBERS OF OTHER GROUPS SOMETHING THAT EVOLUTION BUILT INTO OUR BIOLOGY, AN INESCAPABLE, INEVITABLE CURSE THAT AT BEST CAN ONLY BE MANAGED AND MITIGATED?
942	THIS ARTICLE BRINGS TOGETHER THREE STRANDS OF DEMOCRACY RESEARCH WHICH HAVE THUS FAR SELDOM BEEN INFORMED BY ONE ANOTHER: THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ASSOCIATED WITH THE 'DEMOCRATIC PEACE' THESIS, THE JURIDICAL-NORMATIVE QUESTIONS OF LEGALITY, AND MORAL-PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING ABOUT JUST WAR. LINKING THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE TO THE FINDINGS OF COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON DEMOCRATIZATION AND TO THE NORMATIVE DEBATES OCCURRING IN LAW AND PHILOSOPHY ON JUST AND LEGITIMIZED WARS, THERE IS AN INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION THAT: JUS AD BELLUM AND JUS POST BELLUM CRITERIA MUST BE CLOSELY TIED. THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLE THREATENED BY MASS MURDER AND BRUTAL VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS REQUIRES NOT ONLY A SHORT-TERM MILITARY INTERVENTION, BUT ALSO THE INTENSIVE SUPPORT TO ESTABLISH SUSTAINABLE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. EXTERNAL ACTORS INTERVENING FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS EQUALLY HAVE A DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE STATE- AND DEMOCRACY-BUILDING. FORCED REGIME CHANGE AND AN INTERNATIONAL TRUSTEESHIP PROTECTORATE CAN BECOME LEGITIMATE AND NECESSARY MEANS TO GUARANTEE JUSTICE AFTER WAR AND TO RECONCILE JUS AD BELLUM PRINCIPLES WITH DUTIES POST BELLUM. A PREMATURE WITHDRAWAL OF INTERVENING FORCES, FOR EXAMPLE IN AFGHANISTAN OR IN IRAQ, WOULD AMOUNT TO A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF EXTERNAL ACTORS' POST-WAR DUTIES.
943	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF PROBLEMS OF LEGAL EXPERT EXAMINATION OF LEGAL ACTS. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A NORMATIVE LEGAL ACT AS A BASIC ELEMENT OF LEGISLATION IS ITS LEGAL CORRECTNESS. THE DRAMATIC CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN UKRAINE IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE ROLE OF LEGAL MEANS AND MECHANISMS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF THE COUNTRY. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AIMED AT FORMING CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW, STRENGTHENING THE LAW AND ORDER DEPENDS ON THE PERFECTION OF THE EXISTING LEGAL ACTS, THEIR PROJECTS AND THE ADOPTION OF CORRECT AND LEGALLY JUSTIFIED DECISIONS. ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS CRITERION AVOIDS INCONSISTENCIES IN LEGISLATION AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, ENSURES THE UNITY OF LEGAL SPACE. THAT IS WHY LEGAL EXPERTISE IS A FULL-FLEDGED TOOL FOR ENSURING LEGAL CORRECTNESS AND OVERCOMING RULEMAKING, WHICH REQUIRES A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THE ESSENCE OF LEGAL EXPERTISE IN THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL REGULATION. THE TASKS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE PROCESS OF RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO: THE STUDY OF THE CONCEPT AND FEATURES OF LEGAL EXPERTISE OF DRAFT NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS, BOTH IN THE LEGAL LITERATURE, AND THE CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE.
944	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS NARROWLY AT WHETHER A 'HUMAN SECURITY' APPROACH CAN BE SEEN IN A UN PEACE OPERATION THAT PURSUES STABILIZATION, NAMELY THE UNITED NATIONS MULTIDIMENSIONAL INTEGRATED STABILIZATION MISSION IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (MINUSCA). THE UN'S INTERPRETATION OF STABILIZATION HAS NOT BEEN EXPRESSLY SET OUT, BUT STABILIZATION MISSIONS TYPICALLY WORK ALONGSIDE THE HOST STATE TO EXTEND STATE AUTHORITY AND USE ROBUST FORCE TO COUNTER SPOILERS. HUMAN SECURITY IS A CONCEPT WHICH IS RIGHTS-BASED, PROMOTES THE 'VITAL CORE', HAS A CONCERN FOR VULNERABILITY, UTILIZES PREVENTATIVE PROTECTION METHODS, AND EMPOWERS LOCAL PERSONS TO HAVE AGENCY IN THE PEACE PROCESS. ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO INSTITUTIONALIZE AND MAINSTREAM HUMAN SECURITY PRACTICES WITHIN THE UN. AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF HUMAN SECURITY IS OUTLINED IN THIS ARTICLE AND USED TO ASSESS TO WHAT EXTENT THE MANDATE OF MINUSCA PURSUES HUMAN SECURITY-BASED GOALS. AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF UN DOCUMENTATION LOOKS AT THE MANDATE AND PRACTICE OF MINUSCA AND IT IS ARGUED THAT THE MISSION DOES SEEK TO EMPOWER LOCAL PEOPLE, ENGAGE IN A BOTTOM-UP MANNER AND ENTRENCH THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK ALSO CASTS LIGHT ON ASPECTS OF THE STABILIZATION MANDATE WHICH ARE PROBLEMATIC SUCH AS MILITARIZATION AND COOPERATION WITH THE HOST STATE.
945	THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION OF ARTICLES IN THE FIELD OF LAW OCCUPIES A PROMINENT PLACE IN THE ARBITRATED JOURNALS OF HIGH IMPACT, EITHER BY THE VOLUME OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN EACH ISSUE OR BY THE TRANSCENDENCE OF AN AREA OF KNOWLEDGE THAT DEALS WITH ARCHITECTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE FUNCTIONING OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE ENJOYMENT AND ENJOYMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL CONFLICT, AMONG OTHER TOPICS OF INTEREST. THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO DEVELOP A BIBLIOGRAPHIC BALANCE SHEET ON THE PRODUCTION OF LAW ARTICLES BY RESEARCHERS FROM UKRAINE, PUBLISHED IN THE AMAZONIA INVESTIGA JOURNAL IN 2019, WHICH SUBSUMES TO ACCOUNT FOR: A) INVESTIGATED TOPICS, B) METHODOLOGIES AND DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES, C) SOURCES USED AND THEORETICAL REFERENCES AND, D) CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL SCIENCE. IN THE METHODOLOGICAL, IT IS A RESEARCH CLOSE TO HERMENEUTICS, WON TO INTERPRET THE PROFOUND MEANING OF 31 LEGAL TEXTS INVESTIGATED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF DOCUMENTARY OBSERVATION, AS A TECHNIQUE FOR COLLECTING AND ORGANIZING THE INFORMATION COLLECTED. AMONG THE MOST NOTORIOUS CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT, THE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTION IN LAW OF UKRAINIAN RESEARCHERS IS IN TUNE WITH THE CURRENT PROBLEMS AND TRENDS THAT IDENTIFY LEGAL SCIENCE IN THE WORLD TODAY.
946	THE AMERICAS HAVE THE HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATE OF ANY REGION IN THE WORLD, WITH ADHERENCE TO RULE OF LAW BEING A MAJOR CONCERN IN "THIRD-WAVE" DEMOCRACIES. GIVEN THE SURGE IN VIOLENCE IN MEXICO IN THE YEARS AFTER THE COUNTRY ENDED ONE-PARTY RULE, WE UTILIZE THE COUNTRY CASE TO CONCEPTUALLY AND EMPIRICALLY TEST THE INFLUENCE OF VIOLENCE AND CORRUPTION AS PROXIES FOR "DARK NETWORKS" - COVERT ACTORS WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE LAW - ON CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. IN A LARGELY EMPIRICALLY UNEXPLORED AREA, WE OPERATIONALIZE THE CONCEPT OF DARK NETWORKS AND STUDY THE IMPACT ON CITIZENS OVER CRITICAL JUNCTURES OF THREE MEXICAN PRESIDENCIES. UTILIZING REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY DATA, WE ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF DARK NETWORKS (HOMICIDES AND DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF CORRUPT ACTS) ON SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY AND CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. EXPERIENCE WITH CORRUPT ACTS HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY AND CONFIDENCE IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HOMICIDES HAD A SIGNIFICANT YET ONLY SLIGHTLY POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY AND CONFIDENCE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. RIGHT-LEANING IDEOLOGY HAD A SIGNIFICANT YET ONLY WEAK POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY AND ON CONFIDENCE IN INSTITUTIONS. (C) 2018 WESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION.

947	DOES INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ENHANCE OR WEAKEN THE EFFECT OF BANK REGULATIONS AND SUPERVISION ON BANK STABILITY? WE USE A SAMPLE OF AROUND 1050 COMMERCIAL BANKS FROM 69 EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES OVER THE 2004-2013 PERIOD AND SHOW THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ON THE TYPE OF BANK REGULATION. POLITICAL STABILITY STRENGTHENS THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CAPITAL REGULATION AND ACTIVITIES RESTRICTIONS ON BANK STABILITY AS MEASURED BY THE Z-SCORE. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ALSO ENHANCES THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF ACTIVITIES RESTRICTIONS ON STABILITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF CAPITAL REGULATION AND PRIVATE MONITORING ON STABILITY SUBDUES WHEN GOOD QUALITY INSTITUTIONS THAT INDUCE LOAN REPAYMENT, SUCH AS STRONG CREDITOR RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE PRESENT. FINALLY, WE DO NOT FIND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SUPERVISORY POWER ON BANK STABILITY IS CONDITIONED BY INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. IN FURTHER ANALYSIS, WE DISAGGREGATE THE Z-SCORE MEASURE AND FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CONDITIONS THE EFFECT OF BANK REGULATIONS ON STABILITY MORE BY AFFECTING PROFIT STABILITY AND PROFITABILITY RATHER THAN BY INFLUENCING CAPITALISATION. THESE FINDINGS COULD BE USEFUL FOR BANK REGULATORS IN EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL III ACCORD.
948	TO PROMOTE THE RISK-TAKING AND STABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE, THE STIMULUS-BODY-REACTION PARADIGM THEORY OF THE FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT WAS APPLIED. FIRST, ACCORDING TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE, THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT HELPED TO IMPROVE THE RISK-TAKING LEVEL OF THE ENTERPRISE WAS PROPOSED. BY SUMMARIZING THE ENTERPRISE RISK-BEARING METRICS, THE METRICS SUITABLE FOR THE ENTERPRISE WERE SELECTED. THESE SPECIFIC INDICATORS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE RISK TAKING OF THE ENTERPRISE. THE FINANCIAL ECO-ENVIRONMENT MEASUREMENT METHOD WAS DETERMINED THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL RICHNESS. THEN, THE OLS REGRESSION MODEL WAS BUILT. THE RESEARCH OBJECT WAS THE SHIPPING ENTERPRISES. ECONOMIC BASIC FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT DUMMY VARIABLES, DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT DUMMY VARIABLES, CREDIT RATING FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT DUMMY VARIABLES, RULE OF LAW SITUATION FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT DUMMY VARIABLES WERE INTRODUCED. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE RISK-TAKING OF ENTERPRISES WAS CLARIFIED. FINALLY, THE OLS REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO VALIDATE EXISTING ASSUMPTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE GOOD FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTED THE LEVEL OF RISK-TAKING OF ENTERPRISES. THEREFORE, THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF CREDIT MANAGEMENT, THE STRONGER THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT IN PROMOTING THE RISK TAKING LEVEL OF SHIPPING COMPANIES.
949	A CAMPAIGN BY CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS) TURNED A RELATIVELY OBSCURE AREA OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW-INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS)-INTO THE FOCUS OF OPPOSITION TO THE TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (TTIP) AND LATER THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)-CANADA COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC AND TRADE AGREEMENT (CETA). THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW CSOS IMPACTED ON THE EU'S POSITION, WHILE HIGHLIGHTING THE LIMITATIONS OF THEIR INFLUENCE. COMBINING INSIGHTS FROM CONSTRUCTIVIST INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY LITERATURE WITH SCHOLARSHIP EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF EMOTIONS IN ADVOCACY FRAMING, I CONTEND THAT CSOS WERE ABLE TO CREATE A POLYSEMIC 'INJUSTICE FRAME'. THE CHARACTERIZATION OF TRANSATLANTIC ISDS AS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AROUSED ANGER, WHILE BEING AMBIGUOUS ENOUGH TO GARNER WIDESPREAD SUPPORT. THE AMBIGUITY OF CSOS' ADVOCACY FRAME AND THE CONCRETENESS OF ITS TARGET, HOWEVER, WERE ALSO THE FRAME'S ACHILLES HEEL. THESE ASPECTS PROVIDED SPACE FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO REFORM A SPECIFIC ELEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT AND THEREBY REPAIR THE LATTER'S OVERALL LEGITIMACY. THE COMMISSION'S COUNTER-FRAME EMPHASIZED THE REFORM'S DEMOCRATIC CREDENTIALS BY REPRESENTING TTIP AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE ISDS TOWARDS A SYSTEM OF 'PUBLIC LAW'. WHILE THIS REFRAMING FAILED TO SATISFY MOST OPPOSITION, IT PLACATED PIVOTAL ACTORS AND ALLOWED THE COMMISSION TO MOVE FORWARD.
950	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE GAP BETWEEN DEMANDS FOR PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES IN NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (NRM) POLICIES AND LACK OF SUCH APPROACHES IN THE WORK OF ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES. THE ANALYSIS DRAWS ON PRACTICE THEORY, USING THE CASE OF NRM PRACTICE CREATED BY SWEDISH COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD (CAB) OFFICIALS. THE DATA ORIGINATE FROM OFFICIALS' REFLECTIONS DURING COURSES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR PARTICIPATORY AND COLLABORATIVE COMPETENCES. BASED ON PRACTICE THEORY, OFFICIALS ARE SEEN AS PARTICIPANTS OF A ROUTINISED PRACTICE IN WHICH THEIR INTERPRETATIONS OF THEIR WORK AND ROLES ARE SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PRACTICE IS TO PROTECT NATURE AND MITIGATE RESISTANCE FROM STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH INFORMATION. THESE INTERPRETATIONS HAVE ACQUIRED A REIFIED NATURE, MAKING THEM TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THIS STABILISES THE PRACTICE, MAINTAINING THE GAP BETWEEN DEMANDS IN NATIONAL POLICIES AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. TO ENABLE CHANGE IN THE CAB PRACTICE, THE OBJECTIVE CONSTRUCTED BY OFFICIALS NEEDS TO BE REINTERPRETED TO PRODUCE A RULE OF LAW THAT CAN BE JUSTIFIED AND WHICH CONCURRENTLY PERMITS STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION. TO ACHIEVE CHANGES IN NRM OFFICIALS' PRACTICE, THESE NEED TO BE SEEN IN THEIR INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT AND COMPRISE THE WHOLE SYSTEM, FROM INTERNATIONAL/EU AUDITING LEVELS TO SWEDISH CABS AND THE OFFICIALS' EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES.
951	ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE STATE EXERCISES PUBLIC POWER. AS SUCH, ONE OF ITS MOST VITAL AREAS OF FOCUS IS DISCRETION SINCE THE LIMITS ON DISCRETION ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY THE LIMITS ON THE EXERCISE OF POWER. WITH THE RAPID EXPANSION OF THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE AND ITS GROWING INFLUENCE ON PEOPLES PRIVATE LIVES, SET AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AN EXAMINATION OF DISCRETION IS BOTH NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE. THIS EXAMINATION OCCURRED MOST PROMINENTLY AND AUTHORITATIVELY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CASE DAWOOD AND ANOTHER V MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS AND OTHERS V MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS AND OTHERS 2000 (3) SA 936. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CRITIQUE THE COURTS APPROACH TO DISCRETION AND THE LIMITS THAT THE COURT SOUGHT TO IMPOSE ON WHAT IT REGARDED AS UNJUSTIFIABLY WIDE DISCRETION. IN ASSESSING THE JUDGMENT, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ARTICULATE THE CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTRUMENTS ORDINARILY RELIED ON TO LIMIT DISCRETION, BEING RULES AND LEGISLATIVE SPECIFICITY. WHILE RULES DO LIMIT DISCRETION, THE DIFFICULTY OF CONSTRUCTING RULES THAT DO SO EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE RELIANCE ON THEM AS A MEANS OF REDUCING THE INSTANCES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW QUESTIONABLE.
952	DRAWING ON THE FAST GROWING LITERATURE CONCERNING CHINESE DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSITION, WE SKETCH A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE 'CHINA MIRACLE' THAT THE 'CONVENTIONAL WISDOM' AND 'WASHINGTON CONSENSUS' CANNOT FULLY EXPLAIN. REFLECTING UPON THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS AND THE SUBSEQUENT WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO PRESENT A PARADIGM, INSPIRED BY CHINESE PRACTICE OVER THE PAST DECADES, FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. WE CONJECTURE THAT A DESIRABLE CHINA MODEL MAY MAINTAIN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD ECONOMY AS PROPOSED IN PHELPS (2006) WITH FULL EMPLOYMENT AND RIGHTS TO PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE FUNCTIONING OF FREELY COMPETITIVE MARKETS AND MACROECONOMIC POLICY, NOT ONLY SHOULD A CHINA MODEL BE ABLE TO MIMIC THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF LIBERAL WESTERN DEMOCRACIES, BUT IT MIGHT ALSO POSSESS A MAINSTREAM IDEOLOGY THAT IS DEEPLY ROOTED IN CHINESE CULTURE WITH MODERN SOCIAL SCIENCES AS THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS. TO DIVEST CHINA OF UNDESIRABLE PROPERTIES FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM, IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A PRINCIPLE-AGENT RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN PROVIDE STABLE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FOR DAY-TO-DAY EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, AND PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF ITS CITIZENS WHEN EXTERNAL CHALLENGES THREATEN TO WEAKEN SOCIAL COHESION AND POLITICAL STABILITY.
953	CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION HAS LONG BEEN A SOURCE OF DIFFICULTY IN THE STUDY OF POLITICS. W. B. GALLIE'S ANALYSIS OF 'ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPTS', PUBLISHED IN 1956, STANDS AS A NOTABLE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. HE EXPLORES THE NORMATIVE COMPONENT OF THESE CONCEPTS AND OFFERS SEVEN CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING THEIR CONTESTEDNESS. IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE, WE EXAMINE GALLIE'S FRAMEWORK AND DEVELOP TWO EXTENDED APPLICATIONS, FOCUSED ON 'DEMOCRACY' AND 'RULE OF LAW'. WE UNDERSCORE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF GALLIE'S APPROACH, AS WELL AS CONTROVERSIES IT HAS GENERATED. SOME IMPORTANT CRITIQUES ARGUE THAT THREE OF HIS CRITERIA ARE TOO NARROW. WE SUGGEST THAT THESE CRITICS FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT GALLIE OFFERS BOTH A RESTRICTIVE AND BROADER DEFINITION OF THESE CRITERIA, AND WE SEEK TO RECONCILE THEIR VIEWS WITH HIS ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS. FURTHER, SOME ACCUSE GALLIE OF NAIVELY PROMOTING CONCEPTUAL RELATIVISM BY UNDERMINING STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING CONCEPTS, AND OTHERS ARGUE MORE SYMPATHETICALLY THAT HE IS TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR RESOLVING CONCEPTUAL DISPUTES. IT IS OF COURSE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE GALLIE'S GOAL OF PROMOTING THE REASONED DISCUSSION OF THESE CONCEPTS, GIVEN THE SHARPLY CONTRASTING NORMATIVE AND ANALYTIC PERSPECTIVES THAT SCHOLARS BRING TO THEM. YET HIS FRAMEWORK, AUGMENTED BY THE REFINEMENTS EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE, OPENS PROMISING AVENUES FOR ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE.
954	THE IMPACTS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND AGGLOMERATION DEVELOPMENT ON URBANIZATION ARE COMPLEX. THEY CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY DISENTANGLED BY SIMPLE FIXED-EFFECT REGRESSION ANALYSES. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES THE LAND USE INTENSITY (LUI) METRIC TO MEASURE URBANIZATION, AND FURTHER APPLIES QUANTILE AND THRESHOLD REGRESSION MODELS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF POPULATION (POP) AND AGGLOMERATION DEVELOPMENT (AGD) ON LAND USE INTENSITY USING A SAMPLE OF 297 CHINESE CITIES. THE RESULTS REVEAL THE HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS THAT POP AND AGD HAVE ON LUI. VARIATION IS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE EFFECTS OF POP AND AGD ON LUI BY POP/AGD INTERVALS. AS POP INCREASES, ITS PRESSURE ON LUI INCREASES. IN CONTRAST, THE ACCUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT ARE BENEFICIAL IN RESTRAINING OVERDEVELOPMENT OF LAND RESOURCES WITHIN A SPECIFIC RANGE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX HUMAN AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTS PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS, REFERENCES, AND IMPLICATIONS FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE POLICIES, WHICH CAN GUIDE CITIES WITH GREATER POTENTIAL LAND DEVELOPMENT SPACE IN REDUCING THE RISK OF UNSUSTAINABLE URBANIZATION. POLICIES ARE RECOMMENDED FOR ECOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION, CITY GROUPING, AND SUSTAINABLE LAND USE.
955	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORY OF TECHNOLOGICAL POLICING IN GERMANY FROM THE 1970S TO TODAY. COMBINING PERSPECTIVES FROM INTELLECTUAL HISTORY AND LEGAL THEORY, IT EXPLORES THE IDEAS AND PRACTICES OF HORST HEROLD, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CRIMINAL POLICE AGENCY. HEROLD'S THOUGHT WAS BOTH DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY CYBERNETICS, A FORM OF TECHNO-UTOPIAN THOUGHT DEVELOPED DURING WORLD WAR II AS WELL AS THE BASIS ON WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL POLICING WAS FIRST PUT TO THE TEST IN GERMANY. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HEROLD'S HOPES FOR A CYBERNETIC TRANSFORMATION OF POLICE, LAW, AND SOCIETY. IT LOCATES HEROLD'S CYBERNETIC LEGAL THEORY WITHIN A BROADER CONTEXT OF SHIFTING LEGAL PARADIGMS OF GERMAN PUBLIC LAW TOWARDS THE SO-CALLED PREVENTIVE STATE IN THE 1970S AND 80S. CRUCIALLY, AN ANTI-LEGAL AFFECT IS REVEALED TO LIE AT THE CENTER OF HEROLD'S IDEAS. HIS CONCEPT OF CYBERNETICS ULTIMATELY SERVES TO SUPPLANT THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE CONCLUDING PART, THE ARTICLE ASSESSES HEROLD'S LEGACY AND ATTEMPTS TO BOTH CRITIQUE IT AND POINT TOWARDS A PRODUCTIVE WAY FORWARD BY INVOKING MODERN, SECOND-ORDER ORDER CYBERNETICS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES-PERHAPS COUNTERINTUITIVELY-THAT HEROLD'S ULTIMATE FAILURE WAS NOT ADAPTING CYBERNETICS BUT RATHER NOT STAYING WITH IT ALL THE WAY, SUPPLANTING ITS WEAKNESSES, AND DRAWING ON ITS STRENGTHS.
956	THE MAIN UNSOLVED ISSUE IN THE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH OF THE "NEW" INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS IN THE AREA OF THE INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IS HOW PRODUCTIVE INSTITUTIONS OCCUR, I.E., WHICH VARIABLES EXPLICITLY "STAND" BEHIND THE INSTITUTIONAL "INFRASTRUCTURE" IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESEARCH PRESENTS THE POSTULATES OF THE "NEW" INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS, CLAIMING A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE MOVEMENT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. FURTHERMORE, THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS ANALYZED ON EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL ECONOMIES. THE COMPARATIVE METHOD OF THE ASSESSMENT BASED ON SIX CRITERIA: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND THE COMPARISON OF THE GDP PER CAPITA OF THE SAME AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC INDICATORS, TESTED THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS (H1) IN THIS WORK: INSTITUTIONS ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL DETERMINANT OF THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS IN ECONOMY, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS SEEN THROUGH ECONOMIC GROWTH, ESPECIALLY LONG-TERM GROWTH. THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH SHOWED A HIGH LEVEL OF CORRELATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS' SUCCESS AND THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WITH INDICATIONS OF EQUAL RETURNS PER RATIO AND THE FACT THAT THE ADVANCEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, INDIRECTLY THROUGH GDP, CAN LEAD TO THE GROWTH OF THE RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF ECONOMIES.
957	PURPOSE THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY ON THE DECISION OF PRIVATE FIRMS TO USE EXTERNAL AUDITORS TO VERIFY THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS USE THE DATA FROM 141 COUNTRIES AND THE POOLED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO TEST OUR ARGUMENTS. THE DATA IS PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK'S ENTERPRISE SURVEYS AND IS COLLECTED DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2006 AND 2019. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FIRMS WITH HIGH EXPOSURE TO POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE EXTERNAL AUDITORS TO VERIFY THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS VARIOUS SUB-SAMPLES AND HOLD WHEN WE USE ALTERNATE PROXY FOR POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. THE RESULTS ARE ALSO ROBUST AFTER CONTROLLING FOR POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY CONCERNS. THE AUTHORS ALSO FIND THAT THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY ON THE CHOICE OF EXTERNAL AUDIT IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR FIRMS THAT ARE HEADQUARTERED IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHORS DOCUMENT SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN DETERMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND THE CHOICE OF EXTERNAL AUDIT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THEIRS IS ONE OF THE INITIAL ATTEMPTS (IF NOT THE FIRST) TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY ON THE CHOICE OF EXTERNAL AUDIT AMONG THE PRIVATE FIRMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
958	IRAN HAS A LONGSTANDING CONNECTION WITH TERRORISM, IN PARTICULAR AFTER THE 1979 ISLAMIC REVOLUTION. IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS BOTH A VICTIM AND STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, BUT HAS PREDOMINANTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM WORLDWIDE. IRAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRAINING, FINANCING, AND PROVIDING WEAPONS AND SAFE HAVENS FOR NONSTATE MILITANT ACTORS, SUCH AS HEZBOLLAH AND HAMAS. WHILE IRAN CONSIDERS SUCH GROUPS AS NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENTS, THEY ARE BY CONTRAST DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST GROUPS ACCORDING TO OTHER COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, IRAN HAS SUFFERED FROM TERRORIST ATTACKS, ALTHOUGH IRANIAN SECURITY HAS PROVEN MUCH SUPERIOR TO ITS NEIGHBORS, SUCH AS IRAQ, SYRIA, AND AFGHANISTAN. REGARDLESS OF CLAIMS RELATING TO IRAN AS A VICTIM OR SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, NO OFFICIAL POLICY OR DOCUMENT HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT BY WAY OF A COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY BECAUSE ANY STATED POLICY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ACCOUNTABILITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN PRACTICE, ITS FOCUS IS PLACED ON THE "WAR BY TERROR" AS AN EXTERNAL INSTRUMENT AS OPPOSED TO INTERNAL "COUNTERTERRORISM." BY ANALYSIS OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, STATEMENTS, AND LAWS, BOTH PERSIAN AND ENGLISH SOURCES, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CLARIFY IRAN'S COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY AND FRAMEWORK AND THE ACTUAL PRACTICES OF IRAN IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
959	OUR UNDERSTANDING OF ILLICIT WASTE TRAFFICKING (IWT) IS IN ITS EMBRYONIC STAGES; MOST NOTABLY, THE TRANSNATIONAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON HAS HITHERTO BEEN NEGLECTED IN EXTANT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE COORRELATES OF TRANSNATIONAL IWT AT A GLOBAL LEVEL. THROUGH RECOURSE TO INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THE OFFICIAL BASEL CONVENTION NATIONAL REPORTS, WE CONSTRUCTED A NETWORK OF THE MOST RELEVANT IWT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN 148 COUNTRIES. NEXT, WE QUANTITATIVELY INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE STRUCTURE OF THIS TRANSNATIONAL NETWORK. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ILLICIT WASTE IS TRAFFICKED TOWARD POORER AND MORE INSECURE COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY VIA FORMER COLONIAL CONNECTIONS. AS SUCH, IWT POSES A DIRECT THREAT TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE COUNTRIES. MERE ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND PROMULGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS DOES NOT IN AND OF THEMSELVES EXPLAIN WHETHER A COUNTRY IS PART OF THE GLOBAL IWT NETWORK, ALTHOUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEDICATED COURTS AND TRIBUNALS DOES REDUCE THE RISK OF BEING A RECIPIENT OF TRAFFICKED WASTE. SOLID ANTICORRUPTION MEASURES AND A STRONG RULE OF LAW INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING A SOURCE COUNTRY IN THE IWT NETWORK, WHICH, IN TURN, CALLS FOR A MORE GLOBAL APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
960	RESEARCH ON DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IS DEFICIENT IN ANALYSING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DIMENSIONS THAT ARE BEYOND STANDARD DETERMINANTS OF THE PROVISION OF CREDITS BY BANKS. THIS STUDY FILLS THIS GAP BY ADOPTING A BROAD-BASED MODELLING APPROACH IN EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS FOR A LARGE SAMPLE OF DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. A STRUCTURAL MODEL, INCLUDING BALANCED ANNUAL PANEL DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS AND WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FOR THE PERIOD 2004 TO 2017, WAS ESTIMATED USING PANEL-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS AND TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES. THE CORE VARIABLES DETERMINING THE CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS WERE CONTROLLED FOR IN THE ESTIMATION PHASE. THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE STRENGTH OF LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. INVESTMENTS IN IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR CREDIT DIFFUSION BY THE BANKS. THIS STUDY IS DISTINCT FROM PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF THE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES AS IT DIRECTS ATTENTION TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MEASURES ON BANK CREDIT EXPANSION IN AN INCLUSIVE MODELLING FRAMEWORK. IT MAKES A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE FINANCE INSTITUTIONAL NEXUS LITERATURE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE AND ROLE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY PLAYS IN FOSTERING BANK CREDIT PROVISION IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES.
961	THE STUDY AIMS AT ANALYZING THE PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE OF PROPERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED THE GENESIS OF PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS ON PROPERTY, ITS CHANGING PHILOSOPHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC PARADIGMS, THE GENERAL LAWS OF DEVELOPING SUCH CONCEPTS AS PROPERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. BASED ON THE RESULTS, THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE DREW THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS ON PROPERTY DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF DIALECTICS BASED ON THE UNITY AND STRUGGLE OF OPPOSITES (PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS) CONDITIONING A TRANSITION TO A QUALITATIVELY NEW STATE WHEN "PRIVATE" HUMAN INTERESTS CEASE TO BE THE ONLY COMPONENT IN PROPERTY RIGHTS; ALONGSIDE THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS IN EUROPE, THEORETICAL JURISPRUDENCE WAS DEVELOPED WHICH WOULD BE FURTHER BASED ON THE HERMENEUTIC INTERPRETATION OF PROPERTY WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW; SINCE THERE ARE TWO DOMINANT LEGAL SYSTEMS (ANGLO-SAXON AND ROMANO-GERMANIC), TWO MAJOR SCIENTIFIC PARADIGMS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE FORMED: THE ANGLO-SAXON LEGAL SYSTEM CONTAINS THE CONCEPT OF "DISSIPATING" PROPERTY, I.E. DISSEMINATED PROPERTY RIGHTS REPRESENTED AS A SET OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE ROMANO-GERMANIC LEGAL SYSTEM FORMED THE CONSOLIDATED CONCEPT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, I.E. CENTRALIZED PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHOSE HERMENEUTIC INTERPRETATION IS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONCEPT.
962	ANITA HILL'S TESTIMONY AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS IN 1991 CALLED ATTENTION TO WIDESPREAD SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE US. TESTIMONY FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AGAINST THOMAS KAVANAUGH 27 YEARS LATER UNDERSCORED THE LACK OF PROGRESS IN ITS ERADICATION. USING THE CASCADING NETWORK ACTIVATION MODEL, THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES THE EPISODIC AND THEMATIC FRAMING OF BOTH CASES IN RELATION TO TOP-DOWN INFLUENCERS. A CONTENT ANALYSIS (N= 901) OF US NEWSPAPERS AND TV NETWORKS SHOWED EPISODIC FRAMING DOMINATED COVERAGE IN BOTH CASES. BOTH BUSH AND TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY EMPHASIZED THEIR NOMINEE AS DESERVING OF SCOTUS. TRUMP ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NEGATIVE FRAMING OF BLASEY FORD. THEMATICALLY, REPUBLICAN-LED FRAMING FOCUSED ON AMERICAN VALUES AND MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS DEMOCRATIC-LED FRAMING CONCENTRATED ON RAISING AWARENESS TO THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF SEXUAL ABUSE AND THREAT THE NOMINEE POSED TO PROGRESSIVE RIGHTS. NEWS COVERAGE INCLUDED CHALLENGING BOTH PRESIDENTS, BUT ONLY FOR A TOTAL OF 15.9% FOR TRUMP AND 10.7% FOR BUSH. ON THE OTHER HAND, HILL WAS CHALLENGED IN 40.5% AND BLASEY FORD IN 73% OF NEWS COVERAGE. IN SUM, EVEN WITH STRONG OPPOSITION, THE CASCADE MODEL'S SUCCESS INDICATES THAT WHITE HOUSE MESSAGING CONTINUES TO USURP SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES.
963	THE SOCIAL ORIGINS OF LAW ARE AN OBJECTIVE FACTOR, WHICH ENCOURAGES EXPERTS AND LAYMEN ALIKE TO ENGAGE IN A LEGAL DISCOURSE. THE RELEVANCE OF LEGAL REGULATION PUTS THE SOCIETY UNDER AN ILLUSION THAT LEGAL DISCOURSE IS EASY AND EVERYBODY COULD BE A PART OF IT BY VIRTUE OF USING COMMON SENSE ALONE. LEGAL DISCOURSE, HOWEVER, IS NOT LESS COMPLEX THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH DISCOURSE. AT ITS HEART LIES AN EFFORT TO PEER INTO THE PROBLEM IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. APART FROM ITS RELATION TO OTHER FIELDS, LEGAL DISCOURSE IS HEAVILY DOMINATED BY THE LEGAL SUBSTANCE. LEGAL DISCOURSE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE USAGE OF A UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FILLED WITH LEGAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIAL TERMINOLOGY AND REASONED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC THEORIES. DIDACTICS, I.E. THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH LEGAL REGULATION AND DOCTRINE, ARE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE QUALITY OF A LEGAL DISCOURSE. EFFORTS TO DIMINISH THE IMPORTANCE OF DIDACTICS IN A 'LEGAL' DISCOURSE LEAD TO A SIMULATED SCIENCE (J. BOUDRILLARD). THIS LEADS TO DISINFORMATION RATHER THAT INFORMATION FOR THE SOCIETY. SIMULATION OF A LEGAL DISCOURSE MAKES LAW APPEAR AS SOMETHING INTANGIBLE AND NEARLY METAPHYSICAL. SUCH DISCOURSES DECREASE THE VALUE OF LAW IN THE SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES A UTOPIA RATHER THAN A REALITY OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
964	THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES A VISION FOR THE COUNTRY THAT IS BASED ON FUNDAMENTAL INDIVIDUAL EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION, SUPPORTED THROUGH RIGOROUS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS VISION OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN SOCIETY AS INTEGRAL TO UPHOLDING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, HOWEVER, RELICS ON ENSURING ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES. THIS IS, IN FACT, DIRECTLY PROVIDED FOR IN S 34 OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS INJUSTICE HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF THE WORK OF JUSTICE EDWIN CAMERON THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER AS BOTH A JUDGE AND AN ACTIVIST. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONTINUUM BETWEEN ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUALISED ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES IN ORDER FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO BE ENFORCED. THE AUTHORS HOLD THAT THERE ARE POSITIVE OBLIGATIONS ON THE STATE, AS WELL AS THE COURTS, TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. WHILE THE STATE HAS BEEN DISCHARGING THIS DUTY MAINLY IN THE SPHERE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, THERE IS A DUTY AND A GROWING NEED TO ENABLE THE ADVANCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL CLAIMS. UNLESS THE NEED FOR JUSTICE AND REMEDIES FOR INJUSTICE ARE MET BY THE COURTS AND THE LAW, THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POPULAR LEGITIMACY OF THE COURTS AND INDEED THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF.
965	THE MAIN AIM OF OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS TO QUAN-TIFY THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF FISCAL POLICIES ON INCOME RE-DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE EU MEMBER STATES ON A DATABASE OF FISCAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. OUR RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED BY USING THE GINI COEFFICIENT AS THE INDICATOR OF INCOME REDISTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, AND THE FOLLOWING INFLUENCING VARIABLES: TAXES, INDEX OF PERCEPTION OF CORRUPTION, TAX BURDEN, EDUCATION LEVEL, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX, PRIVATE PROPERTY PROTECTION, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, GDP PER CAPITA, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE. HENCE, BY EMPLOYING BOTH THE 'LEAST SQUARES' METH-OD AND THE 'GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS' WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WHICH HIGHLIGHT IM-PORTANT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISCREP-ANCIES THROUGHOUT THE EU MEMBER STATES, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT FISCAL POLICIES AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS. MOREOVER, BY TESTING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE VARIABLES, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT TAXES EXERT MORE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF THEIR REGRESSIVITY. OUR RESULTS OFFER STRONG EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORT-ING THE IDEA THAT BEYOND DESIGNING MORE BALANCED FISCAL SYSTEMS (BY THE USE OR WEIGHT OF DIRECT/INDIRECT TAXES), PUBLIC AUTHORITIES SHOULD TARGET THE REDUCTION OF INCOME INEQUALITIES USING OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND REFORMS BESIDE THE FISCAL ONES (EDUCATION, RULE OF LAW, LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS QUALITY).
966	MODERN SLAVERY IS A PERSISTENT HUMAN TRAGEDY AND A GROWING ORGANISATIONAL RISK. THE UNITED NATIONS' SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOVERNMENTS IN SHAPING FIRMS' SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA AND COMBATING MODERN SLAVERY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON MODERN SLAVERY RISK. THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, INVESTIGATES THE CRUCIAL POLICY QUESTION OF WHETHER THE QUALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT HAS ANY EFFECT ON MODERN SLAVERY AND WHETHER SUSTAINABLE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REINFORCES THIS RELATIONSHIP. USING DATA FROM 167 COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVALENCE OF AND VULNERABILITY TO MODERN SLAVERY AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS MODERN SLAVERY RISK MITIGATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS OPERATING IN POLITICALLY STABLE SOCIETIES WITH HIGHER QUALITY OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, HIGHER LEVELS OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND STRICTER RULE OF LAW ARE MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIVE TO MODERN SLAVERY RISKS. WE ALSO FIND THAT SUSTAINABLE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (HDI) HAS A MODERATING EFFECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY AND MODERN SLAVERY, AND THIS EFFECT IS MAINLY NOTICEABLE IN LOW HDI COUNTRIES. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT GOVERNANCE REFORMS ALONE MIGHT NOT YIELD THE DESIRED EFFECTS FOR ALL COUNTRIES AND, HENCE, HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS, COMPANIES, AND SOCIETAL STAKEHOLDERS.
967	THE ORTHODOX CHRISTIANITY HAD IN SOME RESPECTS DIVERGENT DEVELOPMENT FROM THAT OF THE WEST, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN SEVERAL CONCEPTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON THE CONTEMPORARY LEGAL SITUATIONS IN THE PREDOMINANTLY ORTHODOX COUNTRIES. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION WE AIM AT EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF TWO MAJOR POINTS OF DIVERGENCE. ONE IS THE COOPERATIVE CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION, THAT IS SOMETIMES DUBBED AS THE SYMPHONIA OF THE TWO. ANOTHER SET OF CONCEPTS THAT ARGUABLY MARKED ORTHODOX CHURCH'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, AT LEAST IN ITS INTERNAL PROCEDURES, IS THE PRINCIPLE OF LENIENCY (OIKONOMIA). IT ALLOWS FOR AN INTERPRETATION OF THE LAWS IN THE INTEREST OF THE PERSON TO WHICH THOSE ARE TO BE APPLIED. WE WANT TO INVESTIGATE WHICH PIECES OF LEGISLATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND WHETHER CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN SERBIA CAN BE TRACED TO SOME OF THE ORTHODOX DOCTRINES. WE CONCLUDE THAT WHILE THE CONTEMPORARY CHURCH-STATE RELATIONSHIP, AS ENVISIONED IN THE CORRESPONDING LAW OF THE COUNTRY, DEMONSTRATES MANY TRAITS THAT CAN BE TRACED TO THE SYMPHONIA TRADITION, THERE IS HARDLY ANY EVIDENCE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN SERBIAN COURTS WERE MARKED BY CONSCIOUS APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF OIKONOMIA.
968	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYSE THE IMPACTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM EMBODIED IN THE PROPOSAL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 32/2020 ABOUT THE STABILITY OF PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS, IN VIEW OF THE CONTRACTING FORMS' AMPLIFICATION FORESEEN BY THE REFORM. FROM THE METHODOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED ON DATA FROM THE ATLAS DO ESTADO BRASILEIRO, ATLAS PRODUCED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH - IPEA, QUALITATIVE EMPIRICAL SURVEY CONDUCTED AMONG PROFESSORS OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW ABOUT THE THEME. WE POINT OUT TO A FLEXIBILIZATION PROCESS OF THE CONTRACTING FORMS IN THE BRAZILIAN PUBLIC SECTOR, CHARACTERIZED BY THE INCREASE IN HIRING OF WORKERS WITH UNSTABLE AND PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS, NOTABLY THE TEMPORARY AND OUTSOURCED ONES. THIS PRECARIPPSNESS' PROCESS OF WORK RELATIONSHIPS, ALSO OBSERVED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, IS RELATED TO IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS THAT OCCURRED IN BRAZIL SINCE THE 1990S, AFFECTING THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ALSO PUBLIC SERVANTS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE PRESENTED ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM TENDS TO INTENSIFY THE PROCESS OF FLEXIBILIZATION AND PRECARIOUSNESS OF WORK RELATIONSHIPS ALREADY CONDUCTED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, PUTTING AT RISK NOT ONLY THE SERVANTS' STABILITY, BUT THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN STATE O RULE OF LAW ITSELF, WHICH MUST BE BASED ON ISONOMY, EQUALITY AND RESPECT TO PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
969	THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND PUBLIC DEBT IN THE CONTEXT OF PAKISTAN. THE HYPOTHESES OF THIS STUDY WERE ASSESSED BY USING THE COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DATA FOR PAKISTAN THROUGHOUT THE YEARS FROM 1996 TO 2018. DATA CAME FROM THE WORLD DATABANK, IMF AND WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS DATABASES. FOR THE ANALYSIS, ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, QUANTILE REGRESSION AND ROBUST REGRESSION WERE EMPLOYED TO ASSESS THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PUBLIC DEBT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE FACTORS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC DEBT, WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PUBLIC DEBT. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, A WEAK COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY POSES A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET RISK AS IT SIGNALS THE EXISTENCE OF AN UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITION THAT RAISES PUBLIC DEBT. IT WAS ALSO REVEALED THAT AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN LEAD TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF FINANCIAL MARKET TRANSPARENCY, HENCE REDUCE PUBLIC DEBT. IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS STUDIES, THE PRESENT STUDY WILL BE BREAKING GROUND IN ENHANCING PUBLIC INSIGHT REGARDING THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON PAKISTAN'S PUBLIC DEBT.
970	THE SUPREME COURT GOT IT RIGHT IN THE ASHERS ('GAY CAKE') CASE. IT DECIDED CORRECTLY THE IMPORTANT LEGAL ISSUES CENTRAL TO THE CASE: THE SCOPE OF INDISSOCIABILITY; THE SCOPE OF 'ASSOCIATIVE' DISCRIMINATION IN SEXUAL ORIENTATION GOODS AND SERVICES DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS; WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELEVANT FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN ACTION AMOUNTS TO UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION; AND THE EXTENT OF THE PROTECTION WHICH FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION ACCORDS INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMPANIES FROM 'FORCED' OR 'COMPELLED' POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION. MUCH OF THE CRITICAL COMMENTARY THAT FOLLOWED THE CASE IS OVERBLOWN. IN SOME RESPECTS, THE CASE IS SOMEWHAT LESS LEGALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND LESS LEGALLY CONTROVERSIAL, THAN THE COMMENTARY WOULD SUGGEST. UNDERLYING SOME OF THE RESISTANCE TO THE DECISION IS A SENSE THAT THE COURT SHOULD HAVE MANIPULATED THE LEGAL TEST OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION TO REACH A MORALLY SATISFYING RESULT. THIS IS NOT HOW THE COURT SHOULD DECIDE SUCH CASES, LEADING AS IT DOES TO A SEVERE RUPTURE WITH THE IDEA OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN ANY EVENT, THE THREE (MORAL) ARGUMENTS THAT ARE DRAWN ON-DIGNITY, EQUALITY, AND CONSCIENCE-SCEPTICISM-ARE LESS HELPFUL THAT MIGHT APPEAR IN ADDRESSING ASHERS-TYPE CASES, AND DO NOT UNDERMINE THE NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION.
971	THIS PAPER MAINLY ANALYSES THE COMPATIBILITY WITH ARTS 5 AND 2, PROTOCOL 4, OF THE ECHR OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE CAMPANIA REGION IN ORDER TO FACE THE SANITARY CRISIS GENERATED BY THE COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS. IT STARTS FROM A DISCUSSION OF THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO MAKE RECOURSE TO THE DEROGATION MECHANISM SET FORTH BY ART. 15 OF THE ECHR AND - AFTER HAVING EXPLAINED THAT THE CURRENT CRISIS GENERATED A SCENARIO WHICH ENTITLED STATE TO ACTIVATE THE DEROGATION MECHANISM - CRITICISES THE ITALIAN CHOICE NOT TO MAKE RECOURSE TO IT. THE PAPER THEN ANALYSES THE SPECIFIC LOCKDOWN MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE AUTHOR STATES THAT - WHILE BOTH THE DECREES ADOPTED BY THE ITALIAN PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND THE ORDINANCES ISSUED BY PRESIDENT OF ITALIAN REGIONS SATISFY THE 'RULE OF LAW TEST' SET FORTH IN THE ECHR - SOME INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH THE CONVENTION MAY BE GENERATED BY THE MEASURES ENACTED BY THE CAMPANIA REGION. IN THIS REGARD, IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS REGARD, ON THE ONE HAND, ARTS 5 AND 2, PROTOCOL 4, OF THE ECHR, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY GENERATE POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATIONS BETWEEN REGIONS IN VIOLATION OF ART. 14 OF THE ECHR.
972	WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING AN ACCELERATED TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATIONS, WHERE ORDINARY MAIL HAS BEEN GIVING WAY TO EMAIL, IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO REPLACE FACE-TO-FACE CONVERSATIONS WITH TELEPHONE CALLS, AND EVEN INSTANT COMMUNICATIONS CAN BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH VIDEOCONFERENCING. THESE EXAMPLES SEEM ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT TRANSFORMATION IN THE COMING YEARS. SIMILARLY, IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION WE FIND MANIFESTATIONS OF THE NEW DIGITAL DIMENSION WITH THE APPEARANCE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT ALLOW THE READING OF DATA IN LIGHT INSTRUMENTS, OR WITH THE GENERALIZATION OF THE USE OF THE INTERNET, WHICH HAS BECOME THE SOURCE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN THE WORLD. TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND THE DIGITALIZATION OF INFORMATION HAVE INFLUENCED SO MANY AREAS THAT EVEN THE EXISTENCE OF A NEW DIGITAL WORLD, A NEW SOCIETY OR A CYBERSOCIETY, DIFFERENT FROM THE TRADITIONAL ANALOG WORLD HAS BEEN DEFENDED. HOWEVER, THE UNIVERSALITY AND TRANSNATIONALITY OF THESE NEW WAYS OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION, WITH ALL ITS BENEFITS, IS NOT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RISKS FOR THE FREEDOMS OF PEOPLE, EVEN FOR THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH HAS AS ONE OF ITS FUNCTIONS ESSENTIAL IS TO GUARANTEE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PROTECTION OF THESE FREEDOMS, WHICH CAN NOW BE DAMAGED BY THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
973	IN PRESENTING THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMUNITY WITH A CALL TO ACTION IN DEFENSE OF THE LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER AGAINST A TREND TOWARDS "AUTHORITARIAN INTERNATIONAL LAW," TOM GINSBURG PROMPTS US TO ASSESS THE SYSTEMIC DYNAMICS AT PLAY IN THE CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. IN DOING SO, WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ASSUMING THAT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW OF ANY PARTICULAR ACTOR WILL BE POSITIVE OR OTHERWISE. A COUPLE OF DECADES AGO EVEN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE THREAT POSED TO INTERNATIONAL LAW BY THE UNITED STATES AS GLOBAL HEGEMON. AND YET FROM TODAY'S VANTAGE POINT, IT SEEMS THAT THE IMPERIAL ACTOR DURING THE POST-COLD WAR PERIOD MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE UNITED STATES SO MUCH AS TRANSNATIONAL CIVIL SOCIETY. THE VERY OPENNESS OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT ENABLES BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO PROMOTE NORMS REFLECTIVE OF THEIR POLICY PREFERENCES HAS ALSO ENABLED CIVIL SOCIETY TO ADVANCE NORMS, PROCESSES, AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES THAT GO BEYOND THE POLICY PREFERENCES OF DOMINANT STATES. IN DOING SO, CIVIL SOCIETY-A HALLMARK OF WHAT WE MIGHT REFER TO AS THE "PSEUDO-DEMOCRATIC" INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM-HAS CHALLENGED THE DELICATE BALANCE BETWEEN POWER POLITICS AND THE REALIZATION OF A PURE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE CONSEQUENCES APPEAR SERIOUS.
974	THE PURPOSE OF THIS CASE STUDY ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC FINANCE FRAUD RESULTING IN AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT OF LOCAL RULING ELITES IN ZIMBABWE, A RESOURCE-RICH YET PARADOXICALLY FRAGILE STATE CHARACTERISED BY DECADES OF RULE BY ROBERT MUGABE. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PHENOMENON OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION OCCURRING IN ZIMBABWE AND TRANSLATING INTO THE MISMANAGEMENT AND MISUSE OF PUBLIC REVENUES FROM NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE SAKE OF PRIVATE GAIN AND POWER CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE LINK BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND ILLICIT FINANCIAL FLOWS BY EXAMINING COMPLEX ORGANISATIONAL NETWORKS AND MECHANISMS CREATED FOR THE SAKE OF DIVERTING PUBLIC ASSETS WITH THE HELP OF FRONT COMPANIES. FINALLY, SINCE POLITICAL CORRUPTION IS INHERENTLY CONNECTED TO THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN AID CHANNELLED TO ZIMBABWE. THE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN ON THE BASIS OF AN ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY SOURCES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE AND EXISTING EVIDENCE. THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH COINCIDE WITH A GENERAL ACADEMIC STANDPOINT SUPPORTING THE NARRATIVE THAT BOTH NATURAL RESOURCES AND AID HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR GOVERNANCE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES GOVERNED BY UNSCRUPULOUS LEADERS.
975	EACH WEEK BRINGS ANOTHER STORY TOUTING THE MIRACLE OF "MACHINE LEARNING" A STRAND OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT USES MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS TO CONSTRUCT COMPUTER MODELS THAT ANALYZE ENORMOUS DATA SETS, OFTEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE. MACHINE LEARNING IS ALL AROUND US-IT IS USED FOR SPAM FILTERS, FACIAL RECOGNITION, DETECTING BANK FRAUD, CALCULATING CREDIT RISK, AND MUCH MORE-AND IT IS IMMENSELY POWERFUL. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN THE CONTEXT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY DECISION-MAKING, TAKING A STEP BACK FROM THE NUTS AND BOLTS QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS, ON WHICH MOST SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY HAS FOCUSED, TO ASSESS THEIR USE FROM A MORE CONCEPTUAL PERSPECTIVE. THE QUESTION I SEEK TO ANSWER IS THIS: WHETHER RELIANCE ON THE OUTPUT OF MACHINE-LEARNING MODELS-EVEN IF HIGHLY ACCURATE-IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL TO MAINTAIN "A GOVERNMENT OF LAWS" AND NOT OF MACHINES. I CONCLUDE THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS OPERATING IN CONTEXTS WHERE THEY ENJOY BROAD DECISION-MAKING DISCRETION SHOULD EMBRACE MACHINE-LEARNING PREDICTIONS AS A VALUABLE TOOL. BY CONTRAST, WHEN GOVERNMENT DISCRETION IS HIGHLY CONSTRAINED BY EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, OR REGULATORY RULES, THE USE OF MACHINE-LEARNING PREDICTIONS REPRESENTS A THREAT TO THE RULE-OF-LAW.
976	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PRACTICE OF POST 9/11 US IMAGE WARFARE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THREE SETS OF ENEMY CAPTURE AND KILLING: UDAY AND QUSAY HUSSEIN, SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND OSAMA BIN LADEN. SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THESE IMAGES IN TERMS OF THEIR POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT, COMPLICATE, AND/OR UNDERMINE THE STRATEGIC NARRATIVES OF THE BUSH AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS AS THEY RELATE TO THE IRAQ WAR AND THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, RESPECTIVELY. TODAY'S NEW MEDIA ECOLOGY COMPLICATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMAGES AND STRATEGIC NARRATIVES. THE ANALYSIS FINDS THAT THE CAPTURE AND DEATH IMAGES OF THE HUSSEIN FAMILY PRIMARILY SERVED TO REINFORCE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION STRATEGIC SYSTEM NARRATIVES OF AMERICAN DOMINANCE AND HEGEMONY, THE ILLEGITIMACY AND OPPRESSION OF THE HUSSEIN REGIME, AND OF 'JUSTICE'; HOWEVER, THE IMAGES CAN ALSO BE INTERPRETED AS COMPLICATING AND POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING THESE SAME NARRATIVES. THE ABSENCE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN DEATH IMAGES SUPPORTED THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S COUNTER STRATEGIC NARRATIVES THAT FOCUSED MORE ON AN AMERICAN IDENTITY OF RESTRAINT AND RULE OF LAW. THE 'SITUATION ROOM' PHOTO THAT BECAME THE REPRESENTATIVE IMAGE OF THE BIN LADEN KILLING ALSO REINFORCED GIVEN STRATEGIC NARRATIVES BY PROVIDING A MORE INNOCUOUS AND LEGITIMATE WAY, ALBEIT STILL VIOLENT, TO COMMUNICATE A STORY OF AMERICAN MILITARY POWER AND JUSTICE.
977	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHOW HOW INDIVIDUAL LAW IS DEFINED IN ISLAM. INDIVIDUAL LAW INCLUDES A SET OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS BOUND TO VINDICATE BY DUTY. ISLAMIC LAW APPROACH IS HOW HUMAN BEINGS TRANSCENDENCE, AND FREEDOM MAY BE FORMED WISELY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - SPIRITUAL FLOURISHING IS THE GOAL OF ISLAMIC SUFISM. THE MAIN TOPICS OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM ARE DISCUSSED HERE ARE FREEDOM OF OPINION, WILL, RELIGION, SPEECH, MEETING, MINORITIES, RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY BEFORE LAW, RIGHTS RESULTED FROM IMPLEMENTING JUSTICE, OWNERSHIP AND SELF-DETERMINATION OF DESTINY AND JOBS, WHICH ARE EXPLAINED THROUGH THE ISLAMIC SUFISM VIEWPOINT. FINDINGS - BY COMPARING INDIVIDUAL LAW IN ISLAMIC LAW WITH THE OTHER LAW SCHOOLS, TRANSCENDENCE OF THE FORMER IS MORE CLARIFIED, RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF THE OTHER RELIGIONS' GNOSTICISM WILL DEVELOP THE PARADIGM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PRINCIPLES HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS STUDY CAN HE USED FOR APPLIED DEBATES IN THE FIELD TO PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL LAW FOR UNDERSTANDING AND RECOMPILATION. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - DELICATENESS, TRUTHFULNESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS OF ISLAMIC SUFISM MAY TARN THE ATTENTIONS OF SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS TO THIS RICH VIEWPOINT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - INDIVIDUAL LAW SCHOLARS HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE TOPIC FROM THIS VIEWPOINT. THIS PAPER OPENS NEW CHALLENGING AREA.
978	THE ARAB SPRING UPRISINGS HAVE RELEASED A FLOOD OF LAND AND PROPERTY CONFLICTS, BROUGHT ABOUT BY DECADES OF AUTOCRATIC RULE. EXPROPRIATIONS, CORRUPTION, POOR PERFORMANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, PATRONAGE AND SECTARIAN DISCRIMINATION BUILT UP A WIDE VARIETY OF LAND AND PROPERTY TRANSGRESSIONS OVER APPROXIMATELY 30 YEARS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE CREATION OF LONGSTANDING, ACUTE GRIEVANCES AMONG LARGE COMPONENTS OF NATIONAL POPULATIONS WHO NOW SEEK TO ACT ON THEM. IF NEW, TRANSITIONAL OR REFORMING GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY ATTEND TO SUCH GRIEVANCES, THE POPULATIONS CONCERNED MAY ACT ON THEM IN WAYS THAT DETRACT FROM STABILITY. THIS ARTICLE CRITIQUES THE CASE OF YEMEN, WHOSE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT, WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, INITIATED A LAND AND PROPERTY MASS CLAIMS PROCESS IN THE SOUTH IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A PRIMARY GRIEVANCE OF THE SOUTHERN POPULATION AS PART OF THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE TRANSITION. A SERIES OF TECHNIQUES ARE DESCRIBED THAT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE MASS CLAIMS PROCESS ONCE IT INEVITABLY RECOMMENCES AFTER THE HOUTHI CONFLICT COMES TO AN END. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD ATTACH MORE IMPORTANCE TO SOCIO-POLITICAL REALITIES AND HOW TO QUICKLY ATTEND TO THEM, AS OPPOSED TO AN OVER-RELIANCE ON SPECIFIC LEGALITIES. SUCH AN APPROACH COULD HAVE WIDER UTILITY AMONG ARAB SPRING STATES SEEKING TO ADDRESS SIMILAR LAND AND PROPERTY GRIEVANCES.
979	WE STUDY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS AND INTERNAL POLITICAL STABILITY, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL POWER AS A MEDIATING FACTOR. WE PRESENT A SIMPLE THEORETICAL MODEL DEMONSTRATING THAT INCREASED RENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERNAL STABILITY OF A POWERFUL INCUMBENT WHILE DESTABILIZING A LESS POWERFUL INCUMBENT. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THIS PREDICTION. EMPLOYING PANEL DATA FOR MORE THAN 120 COUNTRIES FROM THE PERIOD 1984-2009, OUR ESTIMATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT RESOURCE RENTS CAN PROMOTE POLITICAL STABILITY BUT ONLY WHEN POLITICAL POWER IS SUFFICIENTLY CONCENTRATED. INDEED, IF THE INCUMBENT IS SUFFICIENTLY WEAK, RENTS FUEL INSTABILITY. OUR MAIN RESULTS HOLD WHEN WE CONTROL FOR THE EFFECTS OF INCOME, QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS (RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRUPTION), PERSISTENCE OF POLITICAL STABILITY, TIME-VARYING COMMON SHOCKS, COUNTRY FIXED EFFECTS, POSSIBLE ENDOGENEITY OF RENTS AND POWER BALANCE TO POLITICAL STABILITY, AND VARIOUS ADDITIONAL COVARIATES. OUR ANALYSIS DEPARTS FROM THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY EMPHASIZING NOT (ONLY) THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT, BUT RATHER THE STRENGTH OF GOVERNMENT, AS A KEY DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT OF RESOURCE RENTS ON POLITICAL STABILITY. THIS ANALYSIS SHEDS LIGHT ON CURRENT POLITICAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND RECONFIGURATIONS IN THE RESOURCE RICH MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA.
980	THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES' ENCOUNTERS WITH IRREGULAR MIGRANTS IN SWEDEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF INSTITUTIONAL AND STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS. STAFF AND EXECUTIVE CONSIDERATIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY A DE JURE EXCLUSION OF IRREGULAR MIGRANTS, WHICH IS AN ELEMENT OF THE CONTROL OF MIGRATION. STAFF FACE CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS CONCERNING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS, WHICH LEADS TO LEGAL AMBIGUITIES OPEN TO DISCRETIONARY POWERS. THE AIM IS TO EXPLORE THE HANDLING OF SUCH CASES, EXPERIENCES AND CONSIDERATIONS WITH AN INTEREST IN THE VALUES THAT ARE INVOKED WHEN ENACTING DISCRETION AND TO DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNCLEAR LEGAL SITUATION. THE MATERIAL WAS OBTAINED USING WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRES. A TENTATIVE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT THE PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES ENCOUNTER IRREGULAR MIGRANTS AND THAT HANDLING DIFFERS GREATLY. IT SUGGESTS THAT DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND THE CONTRADICTORY LEGAL FRAMEWORK ENDANGER THE RULE OF LAW. DIFFERING REFERENCE POINTS APPEAR TO BE INVOKED WHEN ENACTING DISCRETION: SOME RELATED TO SOCIAL WORK AND OTHERS TO CONTROLLED MIGRATION. THE SOCIAL WORK VALUES INVOKED BY SOME RESPONDENTS MIGHT IMPLY AN APPRECIATION OF A RIGHT TO SERVICES AND CONTROL OF MIGRATION AS INDEPENDENT PROCESSES AND JURISDICTION RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE BEYOND THE NATIONALLY FRAMED LEGAL STATUS AND NOT SUBORDINATED TO POLICIES OF MIGRATION.
981	IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A ONE-AND-A-HALF YEAR LONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IMPLEMENTED BY THE KURT LEWIN FOUNDATION, WE STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE AND THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM OF SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS HOW STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE, OPINIONS, AND ATTITUDES ARE CONNECTED TO ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, DEMOCRATIC VALUES, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES, AND QUESTIONS RELATED TO MINORITIES. WE WERE INTERESTED TO DISCOVER WHETHER WE COULD FIND ANY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SCHOOL LIFE, TEACHING COMPETENCIES, TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE AND STUDENTS' EXTREME RIGHT SENTIMENTS, AND POLITICAL ATTITUDES. ACCORDING TO OUR HYPOTHESIS, STUDENTS IN A MORE DEMOCRATIC SCHOOL SHOULD HOLD MORE DEMOCRATIC VIEWS, AND SHOULD BE MORE OPEN TOWARDS MINORITIES, DEMONSTRATING MORE SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. OUR RESEARCH - FOCUSING ON GRADUATING STUDENT COHORTS, STUDYING IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS LOCATED IN EASTERN HUNGARY ONLY PARTLY CONFIRMED OUR HYPOTHESIS: THE SCHOOLS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT INFLUENCED STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE, OPINIONS, AND ATTITUDES REGARDING ISSUES WITHIN SCHOOLS. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO MOST QUESTIONS, THERE WAS A LIMITED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND STUDENT ATTITUDES REGARDING SOCIAL-POLITICAL ISSUES OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS. OUR RESEARCH ALSO EXPLORED THE UNDERLYING REASONS BEHIND THE RESULTS AND - CONNECTED TO THAT - POSSIBLE WAYS TO AMELIORATE ATTITUDES, FROM THE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT LEVEL TO EDUCATIONAL POLICY-MAKING.
982	AGAMBEN'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF STATE POWER AS FOUNDED ON THE EXPULSION OF OUTCASTS, WHO ARE EMBRACED AS KEY COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM PRECISELY BY VIRTUE OF THEIR POTENTIAL EXCLUSION, STRANGELY OMITS SUCH CARDINAL AND LONG-FAMILIAR FIGURES OF SOCIOPOLITICAL INEQUALITY AS THE SLAVE AND THE BARBARIAN. THESE ARE NEGLECTED DESPITE HOW THEY, TOGETHER, STARE US IN THE FACE FROM THE VERY SAME PAGES IN ARISTOTLE FROM WHICH AGAMBEN DERIVES HIS THEORY OF BARE LIFE, AND DESPITE THEIR KEY HISTORICAL ROLE IN IMPERIAL STATE IDEOLOGY AND IN THE FORMATION OF EMPIRES. AGAMBEN INSTEAD RESURRECTS THE OBSCURE FIGURE OF HOMO SACER, AN ANCIENT ROMAN FORM OF OUTLAW INTERPRETED AS BARE LIFE, MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RETHINKING AND DEBATING CITIZENSHIP, EXCLUSION, AND THE RUSE OF THE. RULE OF LAW. IN THE MODERN WESTERN STATE FORM. AS A TRANSHISTORICAL-PARADIGMATIC FIGURE IT LEAVES ASIDE NOT ONLY ITS OBVIOUS COUNTERPARTS-SLAVES AND BARBARIANS (WHOSE REAL-LIFE REFERENTS, LIKE HOMO SACER, ARE ALSO BOTH HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY)-BUT ALSO THE PRE-STATE AND PRE-LAW EXCOMMUNICATION OF OUTCASTS. IN THIS ARTICLE I DISCUSS THE HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL ANTHROPOLOGY OF OUTCASTS AND OUTLAWS, SLAVES, AND BARBARIANS, WHAT IS OBSCURED BY HOMO SACER, AND WHAT THIS. LIMIT FIGURE. CAN BRING TO LIGHT.
983	THIS PAPER PRESENTS ELEMENTS OF A FALSE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN STATE-CONTROLLED CAPITALISM AND NEOLIBERALISM. AFTER HOLLOWING UP THE ORIGIN OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL NOTIONS COINED BY THE SO CALLED FIRST GENERATION OF CRITICAL THEORY, IT TRIES TO CLARIFY THE TOUCH POINT BETWEEN THESE TWO HISTORICAL MOMENTS OF CAPITALISM BY INSISTING ON THE PREVALENCE AND COMPLEMENTARITY OF A CONCEPTUAL PAIR, WHICH COMES FROM MAX HORKHEIMER E THEODOR W. ADORNO: THE RACKET THEORY (RACKET-THEORIE) AND THE ADMINISTERED WORLD (VERWALTETE WELT). THE TEXT SUPPORTS THAT THE MOST VISIBLE RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION IN EACH CONCEPT - THE RACKET'S SEEMINGLY DYNAMICAL CHARACTER AND THE ADMINISTERED WORLD'S TOTALITARIAN RATIONALITY - HAVE BEEN ALREADY SHAPED WITH VIEWS ON A CONCEPTUAL COMPLEMENTARITY THAT, AT THE END, ANTICIPATES CAPITAL'S MOST RECENT TRANSFORMATIONS, JUST AS THE OCCASIONAL TURN OF CAPITALIST SOCIETIES TO FASCISM. AFTER THIS, THE PAPER PROPOSES A REFLECTION ABOUT THE BRAZILIAN CONDITION NOWADAYS, IN THE THRESHOLD OF A CONVERSION FROM CAPITALISM TO FASCISMO, FROM THE RULE OF LAW TO ANOMIA. PUT ANOTHER WAY, THE BRAZILIAN POLITICAL MOMENT WOULD HIGHLIGHT THE DIVERGENCES AND COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN RACKET AND ADMINISTERED WORLD AND EMPHASIZES THE ACTUALITY OF THESE CONCEPTS REGARDING THE IRRATIONAL ELEMENTS, WHICH ARE MOBILIZED BY POWER AND DOMINATION BODIES OVER THE SUBJECTS.
984	IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ABOUT WHAT QUALITY MEANS IN LEGISLATION, THE OPINION HAS SPREAD THAT LEGISLATION OF GOOD QUALITY IS SYNONYMOUS WITH EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THAT EFFECTIVENESS DOES NOT ALWAYS EQUATE TO LEGISLATIVE QUALITY. THE EXAMPLE OF THE 15TH PARLIAMENTARY TERM IN GREECE, AMID THE ACUTE DEBT CRISIS, IS TYPICAL. THE MOST INTENSE AND NUMEROUS PHENOMENA OF 'BAD', UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW-MAKING IN RECENT GREEK PARLIAMENTARY HISTORY WERE OBSERVED DURING THIS TERM. NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFECTS OF THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION WERE REMARKABLY POSITIVE SINCE ALL THE INDICATORS OF THE GREEK ECONOMY IMPROVED SPECTACULARLY. YET, ANTI-DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATION IS NOT QUALITATIVE LEGISLATION; EVEN AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME CAN ENACT EFFECTIVE LAWS. IN A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, HOWEVER, THE LAW-MAKING PROCESSES, THE CONTENT, AND THE FORM OF DRAFTS MUST FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AND THE STANDING ORDERS OF THE PARLIAMENT; THE LEGISLATURE IS OBLIGED TO PRODUCE LAW BY THE LAW. PARTICULARLY ADHERENCE TO THE PRESCRIBED PROCEDURES IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE, AS IT FUNCTIONS AS A GUARANTEE OF ACHIEVING GOOD LEGISLATIVE QUALITY. AFTER ALL, NO ONE CAN FORESEE THE BEST QUALITY CONTENT AT THE START OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS SINCE IT IS FORMED AFTER CREATIVE FERMENTATION AND BALANCING OF TENDENCIES WHILE FOLLOWING THE PRESCRIBED PROCEDURES.
985	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT OF THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALISED FIRMS IN EUROPE BEFORE AND DURING THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS PERIOD. THE SAMPLE INCLUDES 306 FIRMS FROM 10 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES COMPRISING 2,142 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS FOR THE PERIOD 2006 TO 2013. AFTER CONTROLLING THE INFLUENCE OF FIRM-LEVEL, INDUSTRY-LEVEL, AND MACROECONOMIC FACTORS ON DEBT LEVELS, WE REPORT THAT SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALISED FIRMS HAVE ADJUSTED THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE DURING THE SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS PERIOD AND THE SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT WAS QUICKER IN NON-STRESSED COUNTRIES COMPARED TO THE FIRMS IN THE STRESSED COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THE QUALITY OF COUNTRIES' INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT OF LEVERAGE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALISED FIRMS DURING THE CRISIS PERIOD. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRM- LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF LEVERAGE FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALISED FIRMS IN EUROPE ARE; SIZE AND ASSET TANGIBILITY. FURTHERMORE, THE INDUSTRY-LEVEL DETERMINANT IS INDUSTRY MEDIAN LEVERAGE AND MACROECONOMIC-LEVEL DETERMINANTS ARE GDP GROWTH RATE AND INFLATION RATE. THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IMPROVING THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT (SUCH AS GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION) WILL EASE SMALL AND MEDIUM CAPITALISED FIRMS' FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH IN TURN FACILITATE THEIR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND RESILIENCE.
986	THE POLICIES OF GOING OUT AND GOOD NEIGHBOR HAVE WORKED IN TANDEM TO DIRECT CHINESE DIPLOMACY TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIA OVER THE PAST DECADES. THIS ARTICLE ASKS HOW THESE POLICIES HAVE SHAPED CHINESE ENERGY AND MINING FIRMS' BUSINESS DECISIONS IN THE REGION. USING A COMBINATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE GOING OUT AND GOOD NEIGHBOR HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OF CHINA'S ENERGY AND MINING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, THIS OUTCOME IS NOT MERELY THE RESULT OF A STATE-DIRECTED INITIATIVE. THE GROWTH IS ALSO DRIVEN BY CHINESE STATE-OWNED FIRMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEIJING'S POLICY AGENDA AND THE INSTITUTIONAL SHORTCOMINGS BEHIND IT TO PLOW STATE-BACKED RESOURCES INTO BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS WITH WEAK RULE-OF-LAW GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION. THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE ASSOCIATED PROJECTS ARE OFTEN TOUTED AS AN ARM OF CHINESE DIPLOMACY, EMBOLDENING THESE FIRMS TO MAKE RISKY EXPANSION. MOREOVER, MARKET, DIPLOMATIC, SOCIAL, AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS INHERENT TO SOUTHEAST ASIA FURTHER CATALYZE CHINESE FIRMS' RISKY BUSINESS PRACTICES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BEIJING, PRIORITIZING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS OVER GOOD GOVERNANCE, HAS BEEN SLOW TO POLICE PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM ITS FIRMS' DUBIOUS PARTNERSHIPS. IN THE END, THIS SITUATION HAS HURT CHINA'S IMAGE, CONTRARY TO GOOD NEIGHBOR'S INTENDED OBJECTIVES.
987	THE PROSECUTION, LONG MANUS OF THE RULE OF LAW, MEETS INTERNATIONALLY IN THE LAST PERCENTAGE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND STABILIZATION OF THE SOCIAL ALARM CAUSED BY THE CRIME FACT LACKS A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AS FAST AS EFFECTIVE. IN THE ADVENT OF THE PRIMITIVE CONSECRATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL LANDSCAPE AND THE CONSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR LIFE IN SOCIETY, QUICKLY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THIS CORE OF RIGHTS THROUGH JURIDICAL MECHANISMS EFFECTIVE AND PRAGMATIC CONSTITUTIONAL-PENAL. IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BITTER LEGACY CAUSED BY THE GREAT WARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS SOUGHT CREATE AND PROMOTE RECOURSE TO INSTRUMENTS OF STATE TO STATE, ABLE TO CONTAIN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AGAINST HUMANITY. IN THIS SENSE, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, STOPS HIGH IMPORTANCE IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL SPECTRUM, IN SO FAR AS IT ESTABLISHES THE POSSIBILITY OF ASSIGNING INDIVIDUAL CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE AGENT AND THE STATE, ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, THROUGH AN EMINENTLY FAIR AND CONSEQUENTLY URGENT AND CURRENT JUDGMENT IN COMBAT TO ALL RACES OF IMPUNITY AT THE GLOBAL SCALE. FINALLY, THESE OBJECTIVES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND CROSS THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
988	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FOCUS OF FIANNA FAIL POLICY INITIATIVES RELATING TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND ISSUE IN THE PERIOD 1969-1973 WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR INTERPRETATION OF IRISH REPUBLICANISM AND BELIEFS AS TO WHERE IRISH INTERESTS LAY. MANAGING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE EMERGING CONFLICT WITHIN THE SOUTHERN JURISDICTION IS EXPLORED THROUGH THE LENS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND THE DEFENCE OF THE RIGHTS OF IRISH CITIZENS. CRITIQUES THAT HOLD THAT A FRESH POLITICS HAD EMERGED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND DURING THE 1960S ARE CHALLENGED AS THE LIMITATIONS ON NEW THINKING ON THE NATIONAL QUESTION ARE ASSESSED. THE FIANNA FAIL ADMINISTRATION UNDER JACK LYNCH PURSUED A CAUTIOUS APPROACH, DESIGNED TO REAFFIRM IRISH SOVEREIGNTY TO BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES, UPHOLD POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE STATE AND RESTATE THE CASE FOR IRISH REUNIFICATION AT EVERY AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY. CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN THE BRITISH POLITICAL, SECURITY AND LEGAL APPARATUS AND THEIR IRISH EQUIVALENTS REFLECTED A RESOLUTE IRISH GOVERNMENT EXERCISING POLITICAL AUTONOMY IN PURSUIT OF ITS OBJECTIVES IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE NORMS OF THE TIME. ONLY SLOWLY DID FIANNA FAIL REAPPRAISE, IN A LIMITED MANNER, ITS APPROACH WHEN PROGRESS AT AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL LEVEL SEEMED POSSIBLE.
989	THE STARTING POINT FOR THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN THE LIST OF 147 BANKING CRISES WITHIN THE PERIOD 1976-2011 PREPARED BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. THE COUNTRIES WITH CRISES HAVE BEEN ANALYSED WITH RESPECT TO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WORLD BANK INDICATORS IN THE PERIODS OF THREE YEARS BEFORE THE CRISES. THE MACHINE LEARNING METHODOLOGY FOR SUBGROUP DISCOVERY HAS BEEN USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. IT ENABLED IDENTIFICATION OF FIVE SUBSETS OF CRISES. TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF EU COUNTRIES WITH BANKING CRISES IN THE YEAR 2008. FAST GROWING CREDIT ACTIVITY IS CHARACTERISTIC FOR THE FIRST SUBGROUP WHILE SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEMS RECOGNIZED BY NON-INCREASING QUALITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE DECISIVE FOR THE SECOND SUBGROUP. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EU COUNTRIES INCLUDED INTO THESE SUBGROUPS DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO WORLD BANK GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATOR VALUES FOR THE PERIOD BEFORE THE CRISIS. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE THE INDICATORS WHICH ARE STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT FOR THESE SETS OF COUNTRIES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULT IS IN THE SEGMENTATION OF THE CORPUS OF COUNTRIES WITH BANKING CRISES AND THE RECOGNITION OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BANKING CRISES, SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEMS, AND GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS IN SOME EU COUNTRIES.
990	KANT'S POLITICAL THEORY STANDS IN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT TRADITION, BUT DEPARTS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY. MOST IMPORTANTLY KANT HOLDS, AGAINST HOBBES AND LOCKE, THAT WE HAVE NOT MERELY A PRAGMATIC REASON BUT AN OBLIGATION TO EXIT THE STATE OF NATURE AND FOUND A STATE. KANT HOLDS THAT EACH PERSON HAS AN INNATE RIGHT TO FREEDOM, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY HONOR EVERYONE'S RIGHT ONLY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE WE ARE OBLIGATED TO RESPECT EACH PERSON'S RIGHT TO FREEDOM, AND CAN DO SO ONLY IN A STATE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE IF WE HAVE ONE, AND TO ESTABLISH ONE IF WE DO NOT. IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE ESSAY I RECONSTRUCT THIS ARGUMENT IN MORE DETAIL. IN THE SECOND HALF I SURVEY FOUR POINTS OF CONTROVERSY: (I) WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KANT'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND HIS MORAL PHILOSOPHY? (II) HOW DOES THE INNATE RIGHT TO FREEDOM SUPPORT THE POSTULATE THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND OTHER PRIVATE RIGHTS? (III) HOW DOES THE POSTULATE SUPPORT AN OBLIGATION TO FOUND THE STATE? (IV) HOW SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND KANT'S VIEWS ABOUT POLITICAL REVOLUTIONS?
991	WHEN MILITARY FIASCOS AND FINANCIAL CRISES DROVE CHARLES I TO IMPLEMENT THE FORCED LOAN AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN, HE ENCOURAGED CLERICS TO PREACH OBEDIENCE TO HIS AUTHORITY THROUGH THE RHETORIC OF CONSCIENCE. ROBERT SIBTHORPE, ISAAC BARGRAVE, MATTHEW WREN, AND ROGER MAYNWARING RESPONDED TO THE KING'S CALL, DELIVERING SERMONS BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND JULY 1627 THAT TIED DISOBEDIENCE TO MISGUIDED CONSCIENCE. THEIR EFFORTS REPRESENTED A LARGER EFFORT TO HARNESS INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE AND CONDEMN THE CONSCIENCE ROOTED IN INDIVIDUAL WHIMS RATHER THAN IN THE KING AS A MORAL, RELIGIOUS, OR POLITICAL ANCHOR. HOWEVER, THE FORCED LOAN ALSO INCITED THOSE WHO ARGUED THAT RESORTING TO INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE WAS NECESSARY IN CASES WHERE THE KING'S ACTIONS VIOLATED THE RULE OF LAW. AS ALL PARTIES EXPLOITED CONSCIENCE'S EFFICACY AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DEVICE, CONSCIENCE LOST ITS PRIVILEGED STATUS ABOVE THE SECULAR FRAY AND WAS INSTEAD MADE INTO A MATTER OF POLITICAL CONTENTION. IRONICALLY, IN MANIPULATING CONSCIENCE AS A MEANS OF UNIFYING THE NATION BEHIND ROYAL AUTHORITY, CHARLES AND HIS CLERICS SIMPLY CONTRIBUTED TO CONSCIENCE'S FRAGMENTATION. MY ESSAY EXPLORES THIS EXAGGERATION NOT ONLY OF CONSCIENCE BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL DIFFERENCE, AS CONTEMPORARIES DEPLOYED CONSCIENCE TO PREPARE THE ARGUMENTATIVE GROUND FOR THE POSITIONS THEY WISHED TO ESPOUSE.
992	PARTICIPATORY DECISION MAKING SEEMS TO BE THE NEW DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. IT IS STILL A LONG WAY, HOWEVER, TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES THAT ARE FORMULATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTORS. NON-STATE ACTORS ARE ONLY LIMITEDLY INVOLVED IN THE POLICY DECISION-MAKING. IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT WHEN THESE ACTORS TAKE THEIR COMMITMENT TOWARDS CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS SERIOUS, MORE EFFORTS CAN BE MADE TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABLE DATA AND INDICATORS ON THESE ACTORS' POLICY INVOLVEMENT. WE DISCUSS THE MOST IMPORTANT EXISTING DATABASES ON CIVIL SOCIETY'S POLICY PARTICIPATION AND FIND THAT ONLY LIMITED DATA IS AVAILABLE. THIS MEANS THAT THERE EXIST OPPORTUNITIES TO: FIRST, EXTEND AND REFINE THE EXISTING DATA AND INDICATORS ON THE POLICY INVOLVEMENT OF THESE ACTORS; AND SECOND, INCLUDE THESE DATA AND INDICATORS IN THE ASSESSMENT EXERCISES OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVE A DIFFERENCE, BETWEEN THE AVAILABLE DATA ON THE TRADITIONAL SOCIAL PARTNERS AND THE NEW CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS. THEREFORE, WE ARGUE THAT MORE RESEARCH, DATA COLLECTION AND THE ELABORATION OF INDICES, ON THE VARIOUS POLICY INVOLVEMENT MECHANISMS OF NEW CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS WOULD BE A WELCOME CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TO EXAMINE THE RELATION WITH OTHER GOVERNANCE VARIABLES, SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND RULE OF LAW.
993	ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND GROWTH. THIS PAPER REEXAMINES THIS EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP USING NONPARAMETRIC METHODS. WE USE DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE MEASURES, AS DEFINED IN WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ONLY THREE OF THE SIX MEASURES: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH. REGULATORY CONTROL, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS WERE FOUND TO BE INSIGNIFICANT. THE CONCEPT OF GROWTH PROFILE CURVES ARE INTRODUCED AS A VISUAL DEVICE TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS OF THE NONPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS. WE FIND THAT THE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND GROWTH ARE HIGHLY NONLINEAR. THESE EFFECTS DEMONSTRATE HETEROGENEITY ACROSS INDICATORS, REGIONS, AND TIME. THESE EMPIRICAL RESULTS ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE LITERATURE ON GROWTH DIAGNOSTICS IN DEMONSTRATING THAT SPECIFIC, TARGETED REFORMS TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE MAY BE A MORE EFFECTIVE POLICY LEVER TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATHER THAN WHOLESALE REFORM. FINALLY, THEY PROVIDE A CAUTIONARY TALE TO PRACTITIONERS USING PARAMETRIC METHODS. JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS 37 (1) (2009) 121-143.

994	TH IS PAPER WILL SUGGEST THAT SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR LIBERAL STATES HAVE INSTITUTED A NEW REGIME OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN PARTICULAR. HISTORICALLY, LEGITIMATE STATEHOOD COULD BE SITUATED VIRTUALLY EXCLUSIVELY WITHIN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY; IN THEIR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ALL STATES SUBSCRIBED TO A COMMON NORMATIVE STANDARD WHICH REGARDED ALL STATES QUA STATES AS LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGN EQUALS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION THAT THEY ENDORSED. WITH THE END OF THE COLD WAR, HOWEVER, AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF LIBERAL STATES HAS FORMED WITHIN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY WHICH CONSIDERS ONLY THOSE STATES THAT RESPECT THE LIBERAL VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW AS LEGITIMATE. NON-LIBERAL STATES ARE NOT ONLY DENIGRATED AS ILLEGITIMATE BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THEY ARE STRIPPED OF THEIR PREVIOUSLY HELD SOVEREIGN STATUS WHERE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, MOTIVATED BY THE THEORY THAT INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IN A WORLD COMPOSED OF EXCLUSIVELY LIBERAL STATES, CAMPAIGNS FOR THEIR LIBERAL TRANSFORMATION. FINALLY, IT WILL BE SUGGESTED THAT DESPITE THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN LIBERAL STATES OVER THE DECISION TO INVADE IRAQ IN 2003 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SURVIVES, AND THUS ITS (ANTAGONISTIC) RELATIONSHIP WITH NON-LIBERAL STATES CONTINUES TO PROVIDE A USEFUL METHOD FOR THEORISING INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD ORDER.
995	IN SPITE OF THE IMAGE OF A DEVELOPED E-GOVERNANCE, ADVANCED AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING (ADM) SYSTEMS HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY USED IN ESTONIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THERE IS STILL NO GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THEM. THE DRAFT BILL TO AMEND THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, WHICH WAS PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT IN 2022, TAKES A RATHER CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO THE ISSUE TOO, SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING THE AUTOMATION OF DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS AND IN PARTICULAR THE USE OF SELF-LEARNING ALGORITHMS. AUTOMATED ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS WOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED BY THE APPLICATION OF PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES INHERENT TO THE RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS HEARING AND REASONING. HOWEVER, FOR THE AUTOMATION OF DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS IN APPROPRIATE CASES, A SOLUTION HAS BEEN PROPOSED WHEREBY TYPICAL CASES WOULD BE SOLVED IN A FULLY AUTOMATED WAY BY MEANS OF PREDEFINED ALGORITHMS BASED ON INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES. THIS SOLUTION IS NOT AN UNIVERSAL MAGIC BULLET FOR EVERY SITUATION, BUT MAY ALLOW FOR A CERTAIN DEGREE OF INNOVATION, PROVIDED APPROPRIATE PROCEDURAL AND ORGANISATIONAL SAFEGUARDS ARE RESPECTED. FUNDAMENTAL PRECONDITIONS FOR THAT ARE THE CATEGORICAL SEPARATION OF THE GUIDANCE AND ALGORITHM, AS WELL AS THE PUBLICATION OF THE GUIDE. AN OPTIMAL MODEL OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY HAS TO ENCOURAGE AUTHORITIES TO TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS WHEN IMPLEMENTING ALGORITHMS.
996	THE WELL-INFORMED CITIZEN IN A SOCIETY IS A PREDISPOSITION FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, RESPECTIVELY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM OF MEDIA, AND EXPRESSION ARE AN OUTCOME. THIS STUDY TRIES TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICALLY ACTIVE/INACTIVE CITIZENS AND THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISINFORMATION, BY AGE GROUP. THE METHODOLOGY USED IS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE. THE THEORETICAL OVERVIEW IS SUPPLEMENTED BY AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXISTING DATA AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT REPRESENTS THE CITIZENS' TRUST IN THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR TRUST IN THE MEDIA. FURTHERMORE, AS A QUANTITATIVE METHOD, THE QUESTIONNAIRE TRIES TO RANK CITIZENS' ACTIVITY/INTEREST IN POLITICS BY AGE GROUP AND SEE HOW SUSCEPTIBLE THESE AGE GROUPS ARE TO DISINFORMATION. THE STUDY AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP OF CITIZENS (31 - 45) ARE INDIFFERENT TO POLITICS AND TO REFLECT ON THE CONSEQUENCES THAT A SOCIETY STRIVING FOR DEMOCRATIZATION, SUCH AS NORTH MACEDONIA, MIGHT HAVE. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT MEDIA EDUCATION BE EXTENDED TO DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS OF SOCIETY, AND MEDIA EDUCATION SHOULD ADJUST TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ONE SOCIETY AND REFLECT ON THE SENSE OF NATIONAL IDENTITY THAT, ABOVE ALL, IMPACTS THE SUCCESS OF MEDIA EDUCATION IN ONE COUNTRY.
997	EX AEQUO ET BONO COMPENSATIONS REFER TO TRIBUNAL'S COMPENSATIONS THAT CANNOT BE DETERMINED EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW, IN WHICH CASE THE JUDGE RELIES ON AN ESTIMATE THAT SEEMS FAIR FOR THE CASE AT HAND. SUCH CASES ARE PRONE TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, GIVEN THE SUBJECTIVITY THAT IS INHERENT TO THE CONCEPT OF FAIRNESS. WE SHOW HOW BASIC PRINCIPLES FROM STATISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING MAY BE USED TO REDUCE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY IN EX AEQUO ET BONO JUDICIAL DECISIONS. FOR A GIVEN TYPE OF EX AEQUO ET BONO DISPUTE, WE CONSIDER TWO GENERAL STAGES IN ESTIMATING THE COMPENSATION. FIRST, THE STAGE WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT AMONG JUDGES AS TO WHICH COMPENSATION IS FAIR. IN THAT CASE, WE LET JUDGES RULE ON SUCH DISPUTES, WHILE A MACHINE TRACKS A CERTAIN MEASURE OF THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCES OF THE GRANTED COMPENSATIONS. IN THE SECOND STAGE THAT MEASURE, WHICH EXPRESSES THE DEGREE OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, HAS DROPPED BELOW A PREDEFINED THRESHOLD. FROM THEN ON LEGAL DECISIONS ON THE QUANTITY OF THE EX AEQUO ET BONO COMPENSATION FOR THE CONSIDERED TYPE OF DISPUTE MAY BE REPLACED BY THE AVERAGE OF PREVIOUS COMPENSATIONS. THE MAIN CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THIS TYPE OF DISPUTE IS, FROM THIS STAGE ON, FREE OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY.
998	AS SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS HAS ENTERED A NEW ERA, THE PRINCIPAL CONTRADICTION FACING CHINESE SOCIETY HAS EVOLVED TO TAKE THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT AND THE PEOPLE'S EVER-GROWING NEED FOR A BETTER LIFE. IN ORDER TO MEET THIS NEED THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION, IT IS NECESSARY (1) TO PROMOTE HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING A MODERNIZED ECONOMY SO AS TO MEET THE INCREASED MATERIAL AND CULTURAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE; (2) TO ACHIEVE A SENSE OF GAIN, HAPPINESS AND SECURITY AMONG THE PEOPLE THROUGH SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION; (3) TO SATISFY PEOPLE'S NEW NEEDS FOR DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, FAIRNESS, JUSTICE, SECURITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THROUGH EFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION; (4) TO ESTABLISH AND STEADILY IMPROVE A NATIONAL SYSTEM OF BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CHILDCARE, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, MEDICAL SERVICES, CARE OF ELDERLY PEOPLE, HOUSING, AND SOCIAL WELFARE ASSISTANCE, AND TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TOWARDS COMMON PROSPERITY FOR ALL OF CHINESE SOCIETY; (5) TO PROVIDE BETTER EDUCATION, MORE STABLE JOBS, HIGHER INCOMES, MORE RELIABLE SOCIAL SECURITY, MORE ADVANCED HEATH CARE, MORE COMFORTABLE LIVING CONDITIONS, AND A MORE BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT, AND TO ALLOW THE YOUNGER GENERATION TO GROW, WORK AND LIVE IN BETTER CONDITIONS THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE, FULLY-FLEDGED INSTITUTIONS AND AN ENHANCED GOVERNANCE SYSTEM.
999	ELEVEN YEARS AFTER IT WAS ABANDONED, THE SO-CALLED INDO-PACIFIC CONCEPT IS BACK WITH A VENGEANCE IN REGIONAL SECURITY DEBATES. AT THE 2017 SHANGRI-LA DIALOGUE, THERE WERE ONLY FIVE MENTIONS OF THE 'INDO-PACIFIC' AT THE ANNUAL DEFENCE MINISTERIAL FORUM. IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THE FIGURE HAD JUMPED TO 92. THE INDO-PACIFIC FOUR COUNTRIES PROMOTING THE 'FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC' (FOIP) CONCEPT SHARE MANY PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION AND OVERFLIGHT, CONNECTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THERE ARE, HOWEVER, CLEAR POINTS OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THEM, SUCH THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGIES AMONG THE INDO-PACIFIC FOUR. EVEN IF THE INDO-PACIFIC FOUR MANAGE TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES (AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS IS LOW), IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT ASEAN WOULD ENDORSE THE FOIP CONCEPT. THE REALITY REMAINS THAT INDONESIA AND ASEAN HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE INDO-PACIFIC. THE ASEAN APPROACH IS TO APPROPRIATE ELEMENTS OF FOIP STRATEGY WHICH ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO ASEAN (FOR EXAMPLE, CONNECTIVITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE), YET REJECT ELEMENTS OF FOIP STRATEGY WHICH ASEAN DEEMS INAPPROPRIATE (THE EXCLUSION OF CHINA AND THE LOSS OF ASEAN CENTRALITY). THIS DOES NOT AUGUR WELL FOR THE ADOPTION, IN ITS ENTIRETY, OF THE FOIP CONCEPT BY ASEAN.
