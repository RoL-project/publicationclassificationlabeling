0	REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS NOT WITHOUT EFFECT ON A BANK'S RISK TAKING AND THEREFORE ON A BANK'S DEFAULT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE INVESTIGATE REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF CREDIT RISK TAKING AND BANK'S DEFAULT-PROBABILITY IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES. USING A TWO STEP LOGIT MODEL APPLIED TO A DATABASE OF BANKS FROM EMERGING ECONOMIES, WE CONFIRM THE ROLE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AS A SOURCE OF EXCESS CREDIT RISK, WHICH INCREASES A BANK'S DEFAULT RISK. IN PARTICULAR, THE RULE OF LAW APPEARS TO BE A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF AN EFFICIENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, WHICH MAY REDUCE EXCESSIVE RISK TAKING INCENTIVES.
1	SINCE 1989 A DELEGATIVE FORM OF DEMOCRACY CHARACTERIZED BY INORDINATE PRESIDENTIALISM AND WEAK CHECKS AND BALANCES HAS EMERGED AND CONSOLIDATED IN ARGENTINA. HOW DOES THE JUDICIARY FIT IN TO THIS SYSTEM? SOON AFTER HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT, CARLOS MENEM REINED IN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE TO CONVERT THE JUDICIARY INTO AN INSTITUTION THAT WOULD NOT QUESTION HIS CHIEF POLICY INITIATIVES. HOWEVER, HE ALSO FORGED A SUPREME COURT THAT USED ITS AUTHORITY TO LEGITIMIZE THE PRESIDENT'S ACCUMULATION OF POWER AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THE ARGENTINE EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND IS RELEVANT TO THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS IN NASCENT DEMOCRACIES.
2	USING AS ITS STARTING POINT THE MAY 1997 REPORT BY A PALESTINIAN PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON THE MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS, THIS ESSAY LOOKS INTO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND CHARGES OF CORRUPTION, PATRONAGE AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IT ARGUES THAT MOST OF THE EXCESSES RESULT FROM THE LEGAL VACUUM CREATED BY THE OCCUPATION AND FROM THE ABSENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL COUNTERWEIGHTS TO THE PA IN ALL DOMAINS. WHILE REACTIONS TO THE REPORT DEMONSTRATED CIVIL SOCIETY'S PROFOUND ASPIRATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE ABSENCE OF A STATE NECESSARILY MEANS THE ABSENCE OF A STATE OF LAW AND AN ONGOING STATE OF EMERGENCY.
3	SECURITY IN MODERN SOCIETY MEANS MORE THAN JUST PROTECTING TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY. THE DYNAMICS OF THE EXISTING AND EMERGING NEW THREATS IN THE MODERN WORLD, REQUIRE ENSURING SECURITY IN SOCIETY. SECURITY IS CLOSELY RELATED TO LEGALITY. ACHIEVING SECURITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF TRUST AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AS A FACTOR OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE FOR CITIZENS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH TRUST, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES CANNOT FUNCTION. LEGAL EDUCATION IS THE ONE THAT PROVIDES KNOWLEDGE BUT IT ALSO FORMS PERSONALITIES. INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BE A PROVIDER OF GUARANTEES FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY IN OUR SOCIETY.
4	THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC POLICIES THAT RULE THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF SPAIN AND CHILE THROUGH A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TWO POLITICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARISE IN SIMILAR CONTEXTS, POST AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS. SPAIN AGREED ON A CONSTITUTION IN 1978, WHOSE CONCEPTUAL CENTRALITY IS A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW; AND IN CHILE, IN 1980, A CONSTITUTION WAS ESTABLISHED, WHOSE CENTRALITY IS A LIBERAL AND REGULATORY MARKET STATE, LEAVING EDUCATIONAL ACTORS THE FREEDOM TO BUILD A SYSTEM WHOSE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC IS THE COMPETITION BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. BOTH EDUCATIONAL MODELS ARE ANALYZED IN SOCIOLOGICAL TERMS FROM A LEGAL, POLITICAL AND EDUCATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, IN A GLOBALIZED GEOPOLITICAL FRAMEWORK ON A GLOBAL SCALE.
5	THIS ARTICLE EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES WHY IN A CORRUPTION-PERVASIVE COUNTRY ONLY A MINORITY OF THE FIRMS GET CAUGHT FOR BRIBERY WHILE THE MAJORITY GET AWAY WITH IT. BY MATCHING MANUFACTURING FIRMS TO A BLACKLIST OF BRIBERS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR OF A PROVINCE IN CHINA, WE SHOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT-LED BLACKLISTING IS SELECTIVE: WHILE ECONOMICALLY MORE VISIBLE FIRMS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACKLISTED, STATE-CONTROLLED FIRMS ARE THE MOST PROTECTED COMPARED TO THEIR PRIVATE AND FOREIGN COMPETITORS. OUR FINDING POINTS TO THE FACT THAT A GOVERNMENT CAN USE REGULATIONS TO IMPOSE ITS PREFERENCES WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK AND THE RULE OF GOVERNMENT IS STRONG.
6	THIS ESSAY USES THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICE LAW IN THE 1970S AND 1980S TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEW FORMS OF POLICE SURVEILLANCE WERE TRANSFORMING A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW INTO A POSTLIBERAL PREVENTIVE OR PRECAUTIONARY SURVEILLANCE STATE. IT ARGUES THAT DATENSCHUTZ SERVED AS THE PRIMARY MEANS FOR THEORIZING THE PROBLEMS WITH NEW SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES AND DEFENDING BOTH THE IDEA OF LAW AND A LIBERAL ECONOMY OF INFORMATIONAL RESTRAINT AGAINST THE TRANSGRESSIVE LOGIC OF PRECAUTIONARY SURVEILLANCE. HOWEVER, LIBERAL PRINCIPLES WERE NEVER ABANDONED COMPLETELY, AND AT THE TURN OF 1990S POLICE LAW WAS SHAPED BY THE UNRESOLVED CONFLICT BETWEEN TWO COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF THE ROLE OF THE STATE.
7	IMPERFECTIONS IN THE RULE OF LAW CREATE NEW PROBLEMS OF CONTRACTIBILITY, IN ADDITION TO THE FAMILIAR ONE OF UNVERIFIABILITY OF INFORMATION. ALTERNATIVE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR GOVERNANCE OF PROPERTY AND CONTRACT ARISE BUT ARE ALSO IMPERFECT, AND CAN INTERACT WELL OR POORLY WITH THE FORMAL STATE INSTITUTIONS. SECURITY OF PROPERTY AND CONTRACT IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR FOREIGN TRADERS AND INVESTORS. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS SOME THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF SUCH SITUATIONS. THE GAME-THEORETIC IDEAS AND METHODS RANGE FROM SIMPLE TWO-STAGE GAMES WITH STRATEGIC MOVES TO BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL REPEATED GAMES WITH ADDED ISSUES OF ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION AND IMPERFECT COMMUNICATION.

8	WHAT THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW IS THAT DESPITE THE CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN OUR SOCIETIES, THE DEMAND FOR A UNIVERSAL SYSTEM OF RIGHTS, WITH ATTENDANT GUARANTEES AND MEANS OF EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT, IS STILL A VALID STRATEGY IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. AS LONG AS IT IMPLIES RESPECT FOR OTHERS, TOLERATION IS ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN VIRTUOUS CONDUCT BY CITIZENS. NEVERTHELESS, IT MUST CEDE PREFERENCE TO RIGHTS AND TO FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE WHEN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BELIEFS IMPINGES ON THE POLITICAL PLANE. ANY OTHER OPTION WOULD DISRUPT THE PROPER INTERLOCKING OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STRUCTURE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
9	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES IMPACT OF THE LACK OF CIVIL LIBERTIES ON TERRORISM IN MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES BASED ON TERRORISM INCIDENTS PER CAPITA FOR THE PERIOD 1998-2010. WE CONTROL FOR ENDOGENEITY BY USING OIL REVENUE, MILITARY EXPENDITURE AND UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY RATE AS INSTRUMENTS AND FIND THAT WE CANNOT REJECT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS THAT CIVIL LIBERTIES IS EXOGENOUS. OUR FINDINGS FROM EXOGENOUS MODELS INDICATE THAT AN IMPROVEMENT OF CIVIL LIBERTIES REDUCES DOMESTIC TERRORISM BUT NOT TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM. APART FROM CIVIL LIBERTIES, THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT RULE OF LAW DECREASES DOMESTIC TERRORISM. WE ALSO FIND THAT POLITICAL STABILITY REDUCES TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM.
10	USING SUPERVISORY DATA FROM U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON FRAUD-RELATED LOSSES IN FOREIGN MARKETS, WE FIND THAT LOSSES IN COUNTRIES WITH POOR GOVERNANCE HAVE LOWER RECOVERY RATES. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY AND REVERSE CAUSALITY CONCERNS, AMONG NUMEROUS ROBUSTNESS CHECKS. THE ASSOCIATION IS DRIVEN BY INTUITIVE GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS SUCH AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. IN ADDITION, COUNTRY GOVERNANCE PLAYS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN FRAUD RECOVERY FOR FIRMS WITH POOR RISK MANAGEMENT QUALITY. OVERALL, THIS PAPER PRESENTS UNIQUE AND NOVEL EVIDENCE TYING COUNTRY GOVERNANCE QUALITY TO FIRM-LEVEL RISK REALIZATIONS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
11	DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND HEALTH CARE PLANS ARE IMPORTANT FOR FIRM LEVERAGE AROUND THE WORLD. WHILE CONSOLIDATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET POST-RETIREMENT PLANS INCREASES EFFECTIVE LEVERAGE BY 32%, FIRMS REDUCE THEIR LEVEL OF REGULAR DEBT BY ONLY 22 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, YIELDING OVERALL 23% HIGHER TOTAL LEVERAGE OF PLAN SPONSORS COMPARED WITH SIMILAR FIRMS WITHOUT POST-RETIREMENT PLANS. THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVER OF SUBSTITUTION RATES BETWEEN REGULAR DEBT AND POST-RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IS RULE OF LAW, FOLLOWED BY LABOR MARKET FREEDOM AND TAXES. IN CONTRAST, PENSION GUARANTEE FUNDS AND PRIORITY OF UNFUNDED PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE LESS IMPORTANT FOR SUBSTITUTION RATES.
12	THE OBSERVED FACTS ABOUT RUSSIA'S 2015 RECESSION, SUCH AS ACCELERATION OF INFLATION AND LACK OF INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT, LEAD TO CONCLUSION THAT THIS RECESSION WAS CAUSED BY SUPPLY-SIDE RESTRICTIONS RATHER THAN A FALL IN AGGREGATE DEMAND. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT EASY TO IDENTIFY THESE RESTRICTIONS, THEY MAY BE CONNECTED WITH SUCH THINGS AS INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE PRESSURE ON BUSINESS OR INCREASED MONOPOLIZATION OF THE ECONOMY IN COMBINATION WITH A GENERAL ECONOMIC STAGNATION THAT HAD BEEN LASTING FOR SEVERAL YEARS ALREADY. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, STANDARD MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES CANNOT DO MUCH. RATHER, REVIVAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRES STRUCTURAL REFORMS AIMED AT DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND RULE OF LAW.
13	FACTOR MARKETS OF SORTS DID EXIST IN THE MORE HIGHLY DEVELOPED AREAS OF EARLY MODERN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THEY BECAME MORE EFFICIENT IN THE COURSE OF TIME (ALTHOUGH NOT IN A LINEAR PROCESS). HOWEVER, IN OTHER MORE REMOTE AREAS LAND WAS HARDLY EVER SOLD, LABOUR COULD NOT BE HIRED AND MONEY WAS RARE. NEITHER WAS THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK CONDUCIVE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH, MAINLY BECAUSE THE RULE OF LAW DID NOT APPLY WHERE THE RULER WAS CONCERNED. THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS GOES A LONG WAY TO EXPLAIN WHY LEVELS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WERE LOWER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA THAN THEY WERE IN WESTERN EUROPE AT THE SAME TIME.
14	MARITIME VIOLENCE OFF THE HORN OF AFRICA HAS GENERATED IMMENSE GLOBAL ATTENTION. SHIPS CARRYING CARGO THAT INCLUDED OIL, MILITARY WEAPONS, AND CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED. MORE THAN 20,000 VESSELS PLY THIS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT AREA THAT INCLUDES THE GULF OF ADEN, THE RED SEA, THE ARABIAN SEA, AND THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN EVERY YEAR. TO CONFRONT THE THREAT OF SOMALI PIRACY, A COMBINATION OF NATIONAL COMMITMENT, NAVAL FORCE, AND INTERNATIONAL ACTION HAS EMERGED, PRESAGING GREATER PARTNERING, UTILIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO ADDRESS REGIONAL INSTABILITY AT SEA, 'OUT-OF-AREA' EMPLOYMENT OF NAVAL FORCES, AND THE INTEGRATION OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO FACILITATE REPRESSION OF MARITIME PIRACY.
15	THERE WERE MAJOR GUIDELINES IN THE APPLICATION OF GREEK TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN 1974-5. TRIALS CONNECTED WITH POLITICS HAD OFTEN TAKEN PLACE IN GREECE: IN 1922, 1935 AND DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN THE 1940S. JUSTICE HAD OFTEN BEEN INSTRUMENTALISED DURING PREVIOUS INTERNAL CONFLICTS, MORTGAGING BOTH THE INTERWAR REPUBLIC AND THE POST-WAR DEMOCRACY. THE 1974-5 TRANSITION FOLLOWED A DIFFERENT PATH. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNAL DOCUMENTS OF THE GREEK GOVERNMENT, THERE WAS CONSTANT CARE TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND CONFORM TO THE EMERGING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS WAS SEEN AS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A MODERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY.
16	LAND DISPUTES IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED SETTINGS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED AS A SECURITY THREAT, TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH MEDIATION AND STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS OVERLOOKS THE ROOTS OF LAND CONFLICTS IN LONGER-TERM PROCESSES OF AGRARIAN DEVELOPMENT AND WORSENING CONDITIONS OF LAND AND LABOUR ACCESS. A CASE-STUDY OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN FORMER PLANTATION LABOURERS AND CONCESSION HOLDERS IN EASTERN DR CONGO SHOWS MEDIATION'S INCAPACITY TO COUNTER PERCEIVED STRUCTURAL INJUSTICES IN LAND ACCESS AND DIFFICULTIES IN MAKING A LIVING. WHILE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MAY TEMPORARILY CALM DOWN TENSIONS, IT CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL CHOICES VIS-A-VIS WIDER QUESTIONS OF AGRARIAN DEVELOPMENT AND JUSTICE.
17	A CHALLENGE OF RULE OF LAW IS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE CONTENTS OF LEGAL TEXTS UNDER MODERN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS FOR ITS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE STORAGE, PROCESSING, SEARCH, RETRIEVAL AND COMMUNICATION. THE ARTICLE REVIEWS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR DIGITAL LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION SERVICES. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE SEMANTIC WEB, BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGIES OF STRUCTURED DOCUMENT (XML), METADATA (RDF) AND ONTOLOGIES (OWL) APPEARS AS THE OPTIMAL PLATFORM MODEL FOR THE REPRESENTATION, ORGANIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THESE LEGAL CONTENTS, AND IS AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE REQUIREMENTS CAUSED BY THE PHENOMENON OF LEGISLATIVE CONTAMINATION AND THE DEMAND FOR BETTER AND EASIER ACCESS TO LEGISLATION.
18	IN THE EARLY STAGE, LASSWELLIAN POLICY ANALYSIS WAS OVERTLY VALUE-ORIENTED, STRESSING THAT THE GOAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND POLICY ANALYSTS SHOULD BE TO IMPROVE THE STATE OF HUMAN WELLBEING, DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. HOWEVER, POLICY ANALYSIS HAS SINCE EVOLVED IN MANY DIRECTIONS. ONE OF THEM IS THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF POLICY ANALYSIS IN ITS BROADER TRANSNATIONAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS. THIS PAPER WILL FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF POLICY ANALYSIS IN THE LATEST WAVE OF DEMOCRATISATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF CAPITALIST ECONOMICS TO POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVED IN THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS.
19	THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION CREATED A LEGAL VACUUM IN RUSSIA. VIOLENCE-PRONE ENTERPRISES COMPETED WITH THE STATE TO PROTECT NEWLY CREATED PROPERTY. SOVEREIGN DUTIES OF STATE SUCH AS DRAFTING AND IMPLEMENTING LAWS WERE COMMERCIALISED AND REPLACED BY COMMON LAW AND THREAT OF VIOLENCE. ONLY AT THE END OF THE 1990S DID THE JUDICIARY REGAIN ANY MEANING. HOWEVER, THAT IS LESS THE EXPRESSION OF A STRENGTHENING OF RULE OF LAW THAN THE FACT THAT THE COURT SYSTEM NOW SERVES AS A MEANS FOR A NEW REDISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY. THE YUKOS CASE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS. AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY CAPABLE OF FUNCTIONING HAS YET TO DEVELOP IN RUSSIA.
20	IN OUR SOCIETIES, STRUCTURED ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE RECOGNITION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS ESTABLISHED AS THE CORE OF JUSTICE. THUS, IT IS CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS, AND THEREFORE ALSO ONE OF THE MOST DEBATED, IS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS ITS CONCEPT AND FOUNDATION. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT DEBATE BY PROPOSING A CONCEPT AND FOUNDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, STARTING FROM THE EXPOSITION AND EVENTUAL OVERCOMING OF THE TRADITIONAL PROBLEMS THAT, ACCORDING TO THE DOCTRINE, AFFECT THE POSSIBLE DETERMINATION OF THE CONCEPT AND FOUNDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
21	GLOBALISATION, FINANCIALISATION AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE FUELLED COMPETITION AMONG INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CENTRES (IFCS), WITH INVESTMENT BANKS PLAYING AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE PROCESS. THIS STUDY INTRODUCES NOVEL DATA ON CROSS-BORDER INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUES IN 2000-2014 BY CITY, AND INVESTIGATES THEIR DETERMINANTS. IT SHOWS THAT IFCS EMERGE FROM CITIES THAT ARE ALREADY LEADING DOMESTIC FINANCIAL CENTRES, WITH LARGE, DEEP, FLEXIBLE AND OPEN LABOUR MARKETS, AND A LARGE AND INTERNATIONALISED NON-FINANCIAL SECTOR, IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG RULE OF LAW AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT. STOCK MARKET RETURNS, CORPORATE- AND FINANCE-SPECIFIC TAXATION, ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, AND LEGAL FAMILY OF ORIGIN DO NOT SEEM TO MATTER.
22	THIS RESEARCH NOTE DISCUSSES THE METHODS, THE KEY FINDINGS, AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE SECOND STUDY OF THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF MEXICO. THE 2006 SURVEY, CARRIED OUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION PROJECT (LAPOP), PERMITS COMPARING MEXICO WITH 20 OTHER COUNTRIES. IT MEASURES POLITICAL CULTURE IN DEPTH AND GENERATES A PORTRAIT OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITY. THIS NOTE ANALYZES, IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS: POLITICAL TOLERANCE, SYSTEM SUPPORT, DEMOCRATIC STABILITY, SOCIAL CAPITAL, RULE OF LAW, INSECURITY, AND CORRUPTION. LAPOP 2006'S FINDINGS UPHOLD THE ARGUMENT THAT MEXICO HAS A STABLE AND COMPARATIVELY ROBUST DEMOCRATIC CULTURE THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS DEMOCRACY.
23	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A PRELIMINARY CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LEGAL DISCOURSE IN LITERARY TEXTS WRITTEN FOR CHILDREN AND TAUGHT BY THE ISRAELI GENERAL SECULAR (MAMLAKHTI) EDUCATION SYSTEM SINCE THE 1950S. IT SHOWS THAT WHILE FOR QUITE SOME TIME THIS DISCOURSE DID NOT RECEIVE PROPER ATTENTION IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA AND TEXTBOOKS, PUPILS TODAY CAN BE EXPOSED TO TEXTS INVOLVING PROMINENT LEGAL ELEMENTS AND A DEEP-SEATED AND CRITICAL PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS PART OF SPECIAL ENRICHMENT PROGRAMMES IN THE STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THESE PATHS GIVE VOICE TO THOSE WHO CALL FOR LOCAL LEGAL EDUCATION AND SEE A NEED TO LOOK CURRENT LEGAL REALITY IN THE EYE.
24	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED SERIOUS INTERFERENCE IN THE FUNCTIONING OF PARLIAMENTS, WHICH LED TO DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS IN SPANISH AUTONOMOUS PARLIAMENTS, CONGRESS AND SENATE. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE DECISIONS ADOPTED BY GOVERNING BODIES TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION GENERATED BY THE HEALTH CRISIS, WHERE THE PRESENCE OF THE INSTITUTION WAS ESSENTIAL BUT NEITHER REGULATORY PROVISIONS NOR ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS WERE AVAILABLE. IN OPPOSITION TO SOME IMAGINATIVE SOLUTIONS, IN WHICH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS IMMEDIACY OR ATTENDANCE TO SESSIONS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE DUCTILITY OF PARLIAMENTARY LAW HAS LIMITS IF WE WANT TO STAY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
25	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE COMPLEX AND OVERLOOKED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RECEIPT OF WORKERS' REMITTANCES AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY. USING A SIMPLE MODEL, WE SHOW HOW AN INCREASE IN REMITTANCE INFLOWS CAN LEAD TO DETERIORATION OF INSTITUTIONAL-QUALITY SPECIFICALLY, TO AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF FUNDS DIVERTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES. IN A CROSS SECTION OF ILL COUNTRIES WE EMPIRICALLY VERIFY THIS PROPOSITION AND FIND THAT A HIGHER RATIO OF REMITTANCES TO GDP LEADS TO LOWER INDICES OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND RULE OF LAW, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR POTENTIAL REVERSE CAUSALITY.

26	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES ONE SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF THE USE OF TARGETED SANCTIONS TO COMBAT THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM BY THE EUROPEAN UNION ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL. THE CASE RAISED A NUMBER OF ISSUES INVOLVING THE USE OF SANCTIONS AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS AND PROVOKED A LEGAL CHALLENGE AT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE. THESE EUROPEAN COURT CASES HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED AS A CHALLENGE TO THE USE OF TARGETED SANCTIONS BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO MAINTAIN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. THE FUNDAMENTAL CRITIQUE HERE IS THAT TARGETED SANCTIONS MUST ADHERE TO DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ORDER TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL HUMAN RIGHTS.
27	AID DEPENDENCE CAN POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR INSTITUTIONS BY WEAKENING ACCOUNTABILITY, ENCOURAGING RENT-SEEKING AND CORRUPTION, FOMENTING CONFLICT OVER CONTROL OF AID FUNDS, SIPHONING OFF SCARCE TALENT FROM THE BUREAUCRACY, AND ALLEVIATING PRESSURES TO REFORM INEFFICIENT POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS. ANALYSES OF CROSS-COUNTRY DATA IN THIS PAPER PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT HIGHER AID LEVELS ERODE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, AS MEASURED BY INDICES OF BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, CORRUPTION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE NEED FOR DONORS TO DEVELOP LESS COSTLY AND LESS INTRUSIVE WAYS OF DISSEMINATING STATE-OF-THE-ART KNOWLEDGE ON PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
28	THIS PAPER BUILDS ON INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS THEORY TO ANALYZE WHETHER AND HOW THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT SHAPES THE MICRO-LEVEL GOVERNANCE DECISIONS RELATED TO INNOVATION ACTIVITIES. SPECIFICALLY, WE SUGGEST THAT THE EXTENT OF CO-CREATION WITH VALUE-CHAIN PARTNERS IN NEW PRODUCT DESIGN - A RELATIONAL FORM OF GOVERNANCE - IS INFLUENCED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING OF THE FOCAL FIRM. EMPIRICALLY, WE RELY ON DATA ON 636 MANUFACTURERS IN 21 COUNTRIES. RESULTS FROM A HIERARCHICAL PROBIT REGRESSION SHOW THAT CO-CREATION IS MORE LIKELY FOR FIRMS THAT OPERATE IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE-OF-LAW AND/OR ATROPHIC TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURES. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND PRACTICE.
29	ALMOST THREE YEARS AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC, IT SEEMS TO BE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY SOME TRENDS AND DRAW SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS CONCERNING THE LEGAL RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC CRISIS IN ITALY. WHILE THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM WAS PROBABLY SUCCESSFUL IN SAFEGUARDING THE CORE CONTENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE QUESTION TO BE ASKED MIGHT WELL BE ANOTHER ONE. NAMELY, DID THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF THE USE OF DECREE-LAWS AND PRIME MINISTERIAL DECREES, AND GREATLY DIVERGED FROM THE CIVIL PROTECTION CODE, REALLY PROVE TO BE THE MOST SUITABLE RESPONSE, OR, ON DEEPER ANALYSIS, DID IT END UP GENERATING MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVED?
30	THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING ON HOW COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES INFLUENCE PREVALENCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF FIRMS IN AFRICA. THIS STUDY REINFORCES THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE BY EMPIRICALLY HIGHLIGHTING THAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES INFLUENCE THE PREVALENCE OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF COMPANIES IN AN ECONOMY. USING ARCHIVAL DATA FROM 39 AFRICAN ECONOMIES, WE FOUND THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REGULATORY QUALITY AND FOREIGN OWNERSHIP PREVALENCE. ALSO, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IS PREVALENT IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE POLITICALLY STABLE AND EMBRACE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGH VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW FOREIGN OWNERSHIP PREVALENCE.
31	THE EVOLUTION IN SCIENTIFIC THINKING IS AN EVENT WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROGRESS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE. THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS SEDIMENTED THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CONTEMPORARY SCIENCES, AND A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS FOLLOWED IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, EMERGING NEW PARADIGMS IN OVERCOMING THE EARLIER, ADAPTING THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE TO THE SOCIAL CONTEXT. IN THIS MOVEMENT THERE IS THE PURE THEORY OF LAW HANS KELSEN, WHO TRIES TO SITUATE THE LAW AS A HERMETIC AND ALIEN SCIENCE TO METAPHYSICAL INFLUENCES AND OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES. THIS WAS A SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION IN THE LAW, WHOSE CONTRIBUTION WAS RELEVANT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW WHO LIVES IN MODERN SOCIETY.
32	THE ARTICLE CHALLENGES SOME NORMATIVE AND EVALUATIVE PREREQUISITES AND CONSEQUENCES OF DISTINCT APPROACHES PUT FORWARD IN THE CURRENT GERMAN DEBATE ON (PHYSICIAN-) ASSISTED SUICIDE. FIRST, TWO ALTERNATIVE TYPES OF UNDERSTANDING AND USING THE CONCEPT OF SELF-DETERMINATION (SELBSTBESTIMMUNG) WITHIN THIS DEBATE ARE IDENTIFIED, CONCLUDING WITH THE RESULT OF REJECTING ONE WHILE JUSTIFYING THE OTHER. SECOND, IT IS ARGUED IN FAVOUR OF A STATE PREFERRING A RULE OF LAW WHICH SECURES AND SUPPORTS A RELATIONSHIP-ORIENTED AND INCLUSION-SENSITIVE LIFESTYLE OF AS MANY CITIZENS AS POSSIBLE. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE CONSEQUENCE IS DRAWN TO SUSTAIN THE GENERAL PROHIBITION OF PHYSICIAN- ASSISTED SUICIDE WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED PROFESSIONAL CODE FOR PHYSICIANS IN GERMANY.
33	MANY COUNTRIES NOW HAVE SOME KIND OF NATIONAL CRIME PREVENTION STRUCTURE. THIS NEW CRIME PREVENTION, UNLIKE TRADITIONAL CRIMINOLOGY, EXTENDS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREVENTING CRIME OUTSIDE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE TO HOUSEHOLDS, NEIGHBOURHOODS, AND FAMILIES. DRAWING ON THE WORK OF BRITISH POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER, MICHAEL OAKESHOTT, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES RECENT PREVENTION TRENDS IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES. SPECIFICALLY, THE DISCUSSION APPLIES FOUR OF OAKESHOTT'S CENTRAL THEMES - HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SOCIAL SCIENCE, HIS CONCEPT OF A PERSON, HIS THEORY OF HUMAN ASSOCIATION, AND HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO FOUR EMERGING RATIONALES - EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY, SITUATIONAL CRIME PREVENTION, SOCIAL CRIME PREVENTION AND MARKETING PROSOCIAL VALUES.
34	THE HANDLING OF ISSUES RELATED TO NATIONAL SECURITY WHICH OFTEN IMPLIES CONDUCTS AND VALUES AT VARIANCE IF NOT CONTRARY TO DEMOCRATIC NORMS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT TOO PROBLEMATICAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE CASE OF FRANCE. THUS WAS DEVELOPED A MODULATED JURIDICAL SYSTEM TO PROTECT SECURITY AGAINST EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREATS WITHOUT VIOLATING THE REQUIREMENT OF RULE OF LAW. LIKEWISE, CIVIL RIGHTS SUCH AS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION AND INFORMATION WERE SAFE FROM ENCROACHMENT BY THE STATE. FRANCE'S HISTORICAL POSTURE BUT ALSO ITS STATIST TRADITION HAVE HELPED UNTIL NOW THE RESOLUTION OF DILEMMAS THAT STEM FROM MAINTAINING NATIONAL SECURITY WITHIN THE REALM AND THE CONTROL OF THE LAW.
35	INADEQUATE ACCESS TO SANITATION REMAINS A PERSISTENT ISSUE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES, AFFECTING CHILDREN, WOMEN, AND WORKERS. WE EMPLOY DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATION TO UNCOVER THE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND ACCESS TO SANITATION IN SUB-SAHARA AFRICA. WE FIND THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY INCREASE ACCESS TO SANITATION. MOREOVER, A DICHOTOMY EXISTS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS IN THAT EFFICIENT CORRUPTION CONTROL, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS FACILITATE ACCESS TO SANITATION IN RURAL AREAS. HOWEVER, ONLY VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY MATTER IN URBAN AREAS. THESE FINDINGS GENERATE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS IN ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO SANITATION. (JEL D72, O55, O180, P16)
36	THE PAPER FORMS A FOUCAULDIAN ANALYSIS OF POLICE REFORMS IN MONTENEGRO. DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH POLICE OFFICERS AT ALL RANKS IN 2004, UNDERTAKEN AS REFORM WAS COMMENCING, AND ON INTERVIEWS UNDERTAKEN IN 2010, AFTER MONTENEGRO'S INDEPENDENCE, THE PAPER EXPLORES THE BIOPOLITICS OF LIBERALISATION. THE PAPER AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE NORMS OF INTERNAL SECURITY LIBERALISATION THAT OPERATE BEYOND A LEGAL UNDERSTANDING OF STATE POWER. IT ILLUSTRATES THE OPERATION OF A RULE OF POLICE THAT PRODUCES NORMS CONDUCIVE TO THE GOVERNANCE OF A DYNAMIC MARKET STATE. IT ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF POLICE SUBSISTS WITHIN BUT ALSO SUBVERTS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH TO DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT.
37	THE GOAL OF THIS REFLECTION IS TO DEVELOP AN EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW SOCIAL ACTORS WHO EXPRESS THEIR DISCONTENT IN STREET PROTESTS HAVE COME TO BE CONSIDERED ENEMIES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL STABILITY, THEREBY JUSTIFYING THE REPRESSIVE MEASURES THAT STATE AUTHORITIES TAKE AGAINST THEM. THIS DYNAMIC TRACES ITS LEGITIMACY TO THE EXISTENCE OF A SOCIAL REPRESENTATION OF CRIME THAT ELICITS THOUGHTS OF DANGER AND FEAR FOR A VARIETY OF SOCIAL GROUPS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS REFLECTION, WE WILL ANALYZE THE SOCIAL PROTEST OF 1 DECEMBER 2012 THAT TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION OF ENRIQUE PENA NIETO.
38	THE MODERN AMERICAN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IS A REGIME OF LAWMAKING BY AD HOC MANAGED DEMOCRACY. IT IS THE PRODUCT OF MODERN AFFLUENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WHICH HAVE REDUCED POLITICAL TRANSACTIONS COSTS, INCREASED DEMANDS FOR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND ENABLED CONGRESS TO SUPPLY THE INCREASED DEMANDS BY TRANSFERRING LAWMAKING TO EXECUTIVE AGENCIES. SPECIALIZED, HIERARCHICAL AGENCIES CAN EMPLOY COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MUCH MORE THOROUGHLY THAN A CONFLICT-RIVEN LEGISLATURE, AND THEREBY GENERATE LAW ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE. TODAY'S ADMINISTRATIVE STATE DEPARTS FROM TRADITIONAL RULE-OF-LAW VALUES IN IMPORTANT RESPECTS; UNDERSTANDING ITS ROOTS IN AFFLUENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POINTS TO BOTH CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGAL REFORMERS.
39	THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) PROVIDE TRANSPARENT AND COMPARABLE COUNTRY STATISTICS FOR DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE LINKED TO (UNDER)DEVELOPMENT. YET, DOES THE PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNANCE DATA ACTUALLY ENHANCE PERFORMANCE? IF INVESTORS, DONOR AGENCIES, AND CITIZENS ARE MADE AWARE OF RELATIVE GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE, COMPETITION FOR INWARD INVESTMENT, SUCH AS FDI AND ODA, AND DOMESTIC LEGITIMACY BECOME PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR DIFFUSION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. WE TEST WHETHER SUCH MECHANISMS OPERATE USING THE WGI FOR AFRICA, AND FIND EVIDENCE FOR SPATIAL DIFFUSION OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR DIFFUSION OF REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
40	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ANTI-TERRORIST STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY PERU FROM THE PARADIGM OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. ONE EXPRESSION OF THIS COUNTER-INSURGENCY FIGHT WAS THE NEARLY PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF STATES OF EMERGENCY AND THE ADOPTION OF CRIMINAL EMERGENCY LAWS, WHICH ARE CRITICALLY ANALYZED, BECAUSE THEY LED TO SERIOUS RESULTS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IN THAT SENSE, IT IS SHOWN, WITH SEVERE CONCERN, THE ESTABLISHMENT BY THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT OF LEGAL "BLACK HOLES" AND "GRAY HOLES" AT THE EXPENSE OF VICTIMS OF ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES BY ASSESSING THE POSITION OF THE COURTS AND THE CHALLENGE THEY HAVE IN ELABORATING A DEMOCRATIC AND CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL FOR COMBATING TERRORISM.
41	THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS WON ITS POWER STRUGGLE WITH THE GENERAL STAFF. NOW THAT THE PRIMACY OF POLITICS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE MILITARY HAS IMPROVED. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT NOW FACES A CHALLENGE OF A DIFFERENT NATURE. BEHIND THE SCENES, CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ARE EXERCISING STRONG INFLUENCE ON PARTS OF THE SECURITY SECTOR. NOW TURKEY NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT BY STATE BODIES, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, FREE MEDIA, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. SUCH OVERSIGHT CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. IF TURKEY DOES NOT TRANSFORM ITSELF NOW INTO A FULLY-FLEDGED DEMOCRACY, IT WILL SLIDE BACKWARD TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN RULE.
42	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES WHETHER THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AFFECTS THE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. USING A RANGE OF CROSS-SECTIONAL AND PANEL APPROACHES WE FIND THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF BANKING DEVELOPMENT ON GROWTH IS REDUCED AS THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONS (E. G. RULE OF LAW, LACK OF CORRUPTION) INCREASES. WE DO NOT, HOWEVER, FIND A SIMILAR RESULT WHEN WE EXAMINE THE JOINT EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE ATTRIBUTE THESE RESULTS TO THE ABILITY OF BANKS TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED BY WELL-OPERATING INSTITUTIONS, WHEREAS STOCK MARKETS DO NOT PERFORM SUCH COMPARABLE FUNCTIONS.
43	IN NOVEMBER 2006, AZERBAIJAN TOOK TWO IMPORTANT STEPS IN INTEGRATION TOWARDS EUROPE. BAKU AND BRUSSELS SIGNED A MEMORANDUM ON ENERGY PARTNERSHIP AS WELL AS AN ACTION PLAN AS PART OF THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY. PRESIDENT ALIEV'S REGIME IN BAKU PLEDGED ITSELF TO DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. THERE IS MUCH TO SUGGEST THAT THIS WAS LIP SERVICE. THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ENERGY POLICY AND SECURITY POLICY INTERESTS IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH AZERBAIJAN ARE FAR TOO BIG TO PLACE AT RISK BECAUSE OF AZERBAIJAN DOMESTIC POLICY. MOREOVER, BAKU HAS AN ALTERNATIVE PARTNER IN CO-OPERATION IN RUSSIA, WHICH IS EVEN LESS INTERESTED IN CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
44	ALTHOUGH THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) ARE ECONOMIC ORIENTED ORGANIZATIONS, THEY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE SOCIAL POLICIES OF THEIR MEMBER STATES AS WELL AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. MOST OF THE PROJECTS SUPPORTED UNDER THEIR DOMAIN ARE RELATED TO SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS LIKE HEALTH, EDUCATION. THE LOANS ALLOCATED ARE STRICTLY ADHERED TO CONDITIONALITIES SUCH AS RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. IN THIS PAPER, I SHALL EXPLAIN THE STATUS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ANALYZE WHETHER THEY HAVE CERTAIN HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS. THE CRITICISM ON THE DE FACTO EXPANSION OF THEIR OPERATING AREAS SHALL ALSO BE EXAMINED.
45	THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT THE LEGALITY OF THE ACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION MUST BE SUPERVISED, AND INDIVIDUALS MUST BE COMPENSATED FOR ANY ILLEGAL ACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION. THE ACTIONS OF BOTH THE EU INSTITUTIONS AND MEMBER STATES SHOULD BE IN CONFORMITY WITH EU LAW. INDIVIDUALS, WHO SUFFER A DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE BREACH OF EU LAW, CAN BRING ACTIONS AGAINST THE EU INSTITUTIONS BEFORE THE EU COURTS AND AGAINST MEMBER STATES BEFORE NATIONAL COURTS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES AT EU AND NATIONAL LEVEL, AND TO COMPARE THE LIABILITY OF EU INSTITUTIONS AND MEMBER STATES IN TERMS OF LEGAL BASES, CONTENT, CONDITIONS, AND OUTCOMES.
46	ONE OF THE RELATIVELY MINOR SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IN THE ISRAELI MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, THE MALMAB - TASKED WITH PROTECTING ISRAEL'S WELL-KNOWN POLICY OF NUCLEAR AMBIGUITY - HAS GONE BEYOND THE USUAL CRIMINAL PROCESS ESTABLISHED BY THE RULE OF LAW TO THE GREY AREA OF INTERROGATING AND EVEN HARASSING PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO NOT ABIDE BY ITS STRICT POLICIES, THUS HIGHLIGHTING THE TENSION BETWEEN LEGAL RULES AND NON-LEGAL SANCTIONS EXERCISED IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THREE DIFFERENT CASES CONNECTED TO THE ISSUE OF NUCLEAR AMBIGUITY, WHILE AIMING TO DEBATE THE SENSITIVE ISSUE, PROMINENT IN EVERY DEMOCRACY, OF THE LIMITS AND BALANCE OF SECURITY VERSUS DEMOCRACY.
47	REPRESSION AND EXCLUSION ONLY LEAD TO RADICALIZATION AND TERRORISM. SIMILARLY, DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM, COMBINED WITH EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, CONTRIBUTE TO THE MODERATION OF ALL RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL GROUPS BY ALLOWING A FREE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS WHERE EVERY CITIZEN IS EQUALLY CAPABLE OF PRESENTING HIS/HER VIEWS IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. IN SUCH A DIVERSE LANDSCAPE, THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT TAKE THE SIDE OF ANY PARTY OVER ANOTHER, AND SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE NEW EGYPT AND RESPECT ITS PUBLIC WILL, AS WELL AS ITS RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL CHARACTER. THERE IS NO GREATER THREAT TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THAN AUTHORITARIANISM, WHETHER SECULAR OR THEOCRATIC.
48	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AIMS AT ONCE TO RESTORE VICTIMS' DIGNITY, BUILD CONFIDENCE BETWEEN WARRING GROUPS AND FOSTER THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES NEEDED TO BRING ABOUT A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THE POPULATION, IN ORDER TO USHER IN THE RULE OF LAW WITHOUT ENDORSING PRACTICES THAT AMOUNT TO TOTAL OR PARTIAL IMPUNITY. IN SITUATIONS OF POST-CONFLICT, HOWEVER, GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO FACED WITH OTHER PRESSING NEEDS, SUCH AS DISARMING FIGHTING FORCES, IMPROVING CIVILIAN SECURITY, COMPENSATING VICTIMS AND RELAUNCHING THE ECONOMY OF A SOCIETY IN RUINS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE NEEDS AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS, AND CRITICALLY EVALUATES THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE FORMS JUSTICE HAS TAKEN IN POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS.
49	THE RESILIENCE OF ASIAN FIRMS IN THE FACE OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE IS ATTRACTING RENEWED ATTENTION TO THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN SUSTAINING FIRM COMPETITIVENESS. THE PAPER ADDS TO THIS DEBATE BY DRAWING FROM INSTITUTIONAL THEORY TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF SELECTED FORMAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THE PHILIPPINES. BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY (N = 658) OF BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE PHILIPPINES UNDERTAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK, THE STUDY FINDS THAT ACCESS TO FINANCE, THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS ARE FULLY DISCUSSED, ALONG WITH AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
50	POLITICAL THEORY HAS NOT YET SUCCEEDED IN PROPOSING A CLEAR DEFINITION OF POPULISM. INSPIRED BY THE THOUGHT OF CLAUDE LEFORT, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT POPULISM IS THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE SURE THE "EMPTY THRONE" OF DEMOCRACY CAN BE TAKEN BY A VISION OF THE PEOPLE CONCEIVED OF AS A PLEBISCITARY FORCE, ONE GIVING BIRTH TO A HOMOGENEOUS POPULAR WILL. IT IS A PERSPECTIVE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE LOGIC GOVERNING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AT LEAST IN TWO RESPECTS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE ONE CONCERNING THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF REPRESENTATIVE BODIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ONE REFERRING TO THE SYSTEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES.
51	SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DEDUCE THE DETERMINANTS OF SOVEREIGN BOND RATINGS. IN THIS STUDY, EXTREME BOUNDS ANALYSIS IS APPLIED TO APPROXIMATELY 30 FACTORS PROPOSED BY THE LITERATURE IN ORDER TO ASSESS THEIR ROBUSTNESS WITH A FOCUS ON THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE THAT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VARIABLES RECEIVE IN THE SHAPING OF THE RATINGS. WE FIND THAT POLICIES THAT CONSTRAIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR ARE AMONG THE MOST ROBUST. VARIABLES SUCH AS RULE OF LAW, OPENNESS TO ECONOMIC FLOWS, CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE, AND MARKET FRIENDLY POLICIES ARE FOUND TO BE MORE ROBUSTLY CORRELATED WITH THE RATINGS THAN FOREIGN RESERVES, FISCAL DEFICIT, SOVEREIGN BOND YIELDS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.
52	WE EXAMINE THE INTERPLAY OF MARKETS, ETHICS AND LAW, AND RISING DEMAND FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR IN A MARKET DRIVEN SOCIETY COPING WITH THE PROMISE AND PERIL OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. WE ANALYZE THE MARKET AFFECTING ROLE OF OUR COMMON LAW/RULE OF LAW SYSTEM, ITS ADAPTABILITY TO SOCIAL NEED, AND RESULTANT LEGAL AND REGULATORY ACTION PROMOTING ADHERENCE TO THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE LETTER OF THE LAW. WE PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF MANAGER AND FIRM HARM FROM SANCTIONS IMPOSED DESPITE ADHERENCE TO "THE RULES." FINALLY, WE DISCUSS COMPETITIVE MARKET-COMMON LAW INTERPLAY IN THE COMING ERA OF THE GENOME.

53	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE DETERMINANTS OF INWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ACROSS THE GULF CORPORATION COUNCIL (GCC) COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2009 AND 2017 USING A MODIFIED KNOWLEDGE-CAPITAL MODEL OF THE MULTINATIONAL FIRM. IN PARTICULAR, WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY FACTORS. WE DOCUMENT THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW, WHILE REGULATORY QUALITY WAS FOUND TO BE LESS IMPORTANT. MOREOVER, OUR STUDY FINDS THAT THE GCC COUNTRIES' FDI CAN BE EXPLAINED BY HORIZONTAL MARKET SEEKING RATHER THAN EFFICIENCY-SEEKING VERTICAL MOTIVES. FINALLY, THE EXTENDED SPECIFICATION RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF COLONIAL RELATIONSHIPS, COMMON LANGUAGE AND CONTIGUITY.
54	DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON ILLEGAL ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING (ASM) TYPICALLY ASSUME THAT FORMALISATION WILL ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND POVERTY. BUT THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ON LEGAL SMALL-SCALE MINERS' (SSMS) PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, OR ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT SHOULD INFORM DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES. BASED ON A SURVEY OF 137 LEGAL SSMS, THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE PERCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES OF LEGAL SSMS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF AN ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND ANTI-CORRUPTION PROGRAMME, WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE SUBTHEME, IN GHANA. DATA SUGGEST THAT FORMALISATION MAY NOT BE A PANACEA FOR IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE, FINDINGS WITH POLICY AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES.
55	THIS RESEARCH ANALYSES THE PERUVIAN DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE ON THE BASIS OF THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK PRESENTED BY LEONARDO MORLINO ON THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY. IT ANALYSES EIGHT DIMENSIONS SUCH AS POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, POLITICAL COMPETITION, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, RESPONSIVENESS, FREEDOMS, AND EQUALITY. THE RESEARCH BUILDS ON PREVIOUS RESEARCH, SUCH AS THE FIRST EVALUATION CARRIED OUT IN 2012; IT SPOTLIGHTS A SERIES OF CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC POLICY AND THE NEED TO OVERCOME THE CURRENT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN. IN SHORT, IT SEEKS TO VERIFY THE PROGRESS, OBSTACLES, AND SETBACKS IN TERMS OF THE DETERIORATION-OR NO-OF DEMOCRACY IN PERU.
56	THE TWO MOST NOTORIOUS DEMAGOGUES IN RECENT AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY (1945-2019) ARE LINKED THROUGH THE UNSCRUPULOUS LAWYER AND FIXER ROY COHN, WHO WORKED FOR THEM BOTH. HIS CAREER SUGGESTS AN ENTREE INTO A BIOGRAPHICAL EFFORT TO COMPARE SENATOR JOSEPH R. MCCARTHY AND PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, BOTH OF WHOM DEMONSTRATED AN APTITUDE FOR AROUSING POPULAR FEARS AND ANIMOSITIES AND FOR SOWING DISCORD AND DIVISIVENESS. BOTH WERE MENDACIOUS. YET MCCARTHY DID NOT DIRECTLY AND EXPLICITLY ACTIVATE BIGOTRY OR NATIVISM, IN CONTRAST TO TRUMP, AND DID NOT RISE ABOVE SERVICE AS JUNIOR SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, POSING LESS OF A THREAT TO DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
57	THE LAW AS RULE OF LAW, HAS A DIRECT CORRELATION TO SOCIETY IN TERMS OF ITS APPLICABILITY, SINCE CERTAIN RIGHTS CAN BE DENIED OR MITIGATED DEPENDING ON HOW THE RULE COULD BE INTERPRETED TO SOCIAL CONTEXT, THEN HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS BROAD CAN BE REDUCED FROM THE WAY A GROUP IS INSERTED AND IS STIGMATIZED. THIS REALITY IS EXPERIENCED BY WOMEN WHO ARE EXPERIENCING A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RIGHTS DUE TO THE SYMBOLIC AND DISCURSIVE STRUCTURES IN THE COMMUNITY. THUS THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS A RESULT OF A SOCIAL ATTITUDE TO A VULNERABLE GROUP.
58	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE GROUNDBREAKING BUT LITTLE UNDERSTOOD INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA (CICIG) TO DEVELOP AN IMPROVED RULE OF LAW MODEL FOR THE UN IN REFORMING WEAK LEGAL SYSTEMS. IT ENGAGES IN AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF CICIG'S ACTIVITIES AND A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CICIG AGAINST SIMILAR INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT CICIG'S LEVEL OF INTEGRATION INTO THE LOCAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND ITS DUAL FOCUS ON POWERS TO PROMOTE PROSECUTIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM TOOLS MAKE IT A UNIQUE MODEL WORTH REPLICATING. THIS ARTICLE ALSO MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO FURTHER IMPROVE CICIG'S MODEL FOR FUTURE APPLICATION TO NEW CONTEXTS AND COUNTRIES.
59	THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE PRESCRIBES THAT, IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING SERIOUS RISK OF HARM, SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTY SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT ACTION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IN JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING IN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE PRINCIPLE HAS, IN SOME CASES, SUPPLANTED MORE RIGOROUS LEGAL STANDARDS OF REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT ACTION AND JUSTIFIED A STANCE OF JUDICIAL NON-INTERVENTION. IN THIS RESPECT, RELIANCE ON THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE RISKS SUBVERTING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. THE ARTICLE OFFERS GUIDANCE FOR DEVELOPING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IN THESE CONTEXTS.
60	THIS SHORT ESSAY AIMS AT SHEDDING SOME LIGHT ON THE USE OF LAWFARE AS AN EMERGING DOMAIN OF FULL SPECTRUM WARFARE WHICH CAN EITHER BE USED IN ITS OWN RIGHT TO ACHIEVE ITS OWN STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR AS AN ENABLER WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF INFLUENCING THE ADVERSARY IN CONNECTION WITH WELL-PLANNED INFO-OPS AND STRATCOM OPERATIONS. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT CONSIDERING THE LAW AS A DOMAIN, THE USE OF LAWFARE IS AN "OFFSET STRATEGY," WHICH WILL PROVIDE A CONSIDERABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE PROPER OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE APPLICABILITY OF LAW WHICH WILL PREVENT POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES TO ABUSE THE RULE OF LAW TO ACHIEVE THEIR OWN STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.
61	IN A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW INVOLVES FUNDAMENTAL TENETS SUCH AS EQUAL ACCESS TO THE COURTS AND A FAIR TRIAL WHOSE OUTCOME DEPENDS ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE THAT IS IMPARTIAL AND FREE OF PREJUDGMENT. FULFILMENT OF THESE TENETS IS CHALLENGING IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY WHERE PARTS OF THE POPULATION DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND DO NOT ADHERE TO UNIFORM CULTURAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES. AUSTRALIA FACES THESE CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT IS BOTH A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, AUSTRALIAN JUDGES NEED TO BE ADEQUATELY EQUIPPED TO RECOGNISE AND MANAGE THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO APPEAR IN THEIR COURTS.
62	IN THE PAST 20 YEARS, CHINA'S ECONOMY MADE A DRAMATIC CHANGE. THIS WAS LIKELY DUE TO ITS IMPROVED INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE USE 6 GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, COMPILED BY WORLD BANK, TO MEASURE THE CHANGE IN CHINA'S INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND TO PROVIDE SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND A FIRM'S CHOICE ON ENTRY MODE. WE DETERMINED THAT IMPROVED POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW WOULD INDUCE FOREIGN FIRMS ENTERING CHINA TO BE MORE WILLING TO UTILIZE A HIGH-COMMITMENT ENTRY MODE, AND THUS, WOULD RESULT IN MORE STABLE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FROM FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS.
63	THIS PAPER REPORTS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GOVERNANCE INDEX FOR FIJI ISLANDS FOR THE PERIOD 1985 TO 2003. THE GOVERNANCE INDEX HAS THREE CORE DIMENSIONS, EACH A COMPOSITE OF SEVERAL INDICATORS. TIME SERIES FOR EACH OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE, AS WELL AS FOR THE OVERALL GOVERNANCE INDEX, ARE PRESENTED IN A RANGE FROM ZERO (POOREST ACHIEVEMENT) TO 1.0 (BEST ACHIEVEMENT). THE INDICES INDICATE THAT FIJI'S GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE WAS VERY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COUPS OF 1987 AND 2000, WITH THE RULE OF LAW DIMENSION BEING THE MOST ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE INDEX CONSTRUCTED PROVIDES A BASIS FROM WHICH TO MONITOR FUTURE GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE.
64	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE TOPIC OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL ORDER CONCEIVED OF BY THE LATE POPE JOHN PAUL II. THIS ORDER IS NOT "NEW," HOWEVER, BUT GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNINGS OF HIS PONTIFICATE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW ORDER WILL BE CONSIDERED. SOME ATTENTION WILL ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE HOLY SEE'S EFFORTS TO PROPOSE A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE TO THE "WAR ON TERRORISM" BY CREATING A MORE PEACEFUL ORDER BASED ON THE CONCEPTS OF HUMAN DIGNITY, DEVELOPMENT, SOLIDARITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. ULTIMATELY ALL NATIONS ARE CALLED TO THE DUTY OF CREATING PEACE, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS PLACED UPON THE UNITED NATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.
65	US UNIVERSITIES ARE LEADING THE WAY IN TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION, WHILE UNIVERSITIES IN RUSSIA LAG FAR BEHIND. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BEST AMERICAN PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE MAIN ISSUES OF TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION AT THE US UNIVERSITIES. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE CONSIDER THE EXPERIENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK. IN THE NEXT SECTION, WE TURN TO TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION IN RUSSIA, WHERE IT STRUGGLES FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE THAT RUSSIA CAN IMPROVE ITS TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION BY STUDYING THE EXAMPLE OF THE LEADING US ENTREPRENEURIAL UNIVERSITIES AND IMPLEMENTING PROPER PROCEDURES. AND THE IMPORTANT OVERARCHING POINT IS THAT RUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES NEED TO IMPROVE THEIR COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY, AND THEY NEED TO DEVELOP NEW STANDARDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE, RESEARCH, AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY THAT WILL PROMOTE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
66	THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE INCENTIVES POSED BY THE LEGAL REGIMEN THAT REGULATES THE CIVIL SERVICE IN SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THE CASE OF BRAZIL IS STUDIED MOST CLOSELY. ONE OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THIS SYSTEM IS THE EXISTENCE OF BROAD TENURE GUARANTEES WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECT THE WAY INCENTIVES ARE OFFERED TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE ORIGINS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TENURE SYSTEM TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THESE COUNTRIES AND PRESENTS SIX OBJECTIVELY DESIGNED PROPOSALS TO REALIGN THE INCENTIVES TO WHICH CIVIL SERVANTS ARE SUBJECT TO WITHOUT, AT LEAST FOR NOW, DISMANTLING THE TENURE SYSTEM.
67	IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE STUDY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS REQUIRES SPECIAL CONSIDERATION IN THE LOGICAL AND RATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE PROCEDURE, SO THAT FORENSIC PRACTICES CORRESPOND TO THE DEEPEST AND PROPER NATURE OF THE PROCEDURAL LEGAL RELATIONSHIP. ALESSANDRO GIULIANI SHOWS US, WITH SCIENTIFIC AND HISTORICAL BASES, THAT SINCE ITS ANCIENT, MEDIEVAL ORIGINS AND THE LATEST CONTRIBUTIONS OF MODERNITY THAT THE TRADITIONAL PROCESS HAS A TRULY DIALECTICAL NATURE, WHICH HE CALLS << CONTROVERSY >>, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE PARTIES AND THE COURT INTERACT, AND WHICH HAS -AT THE SAME TIME- A STRONG INTERRELATION WITH ETHICS AND POLITICS.
68	FROM PUSSY RIOT TO MICHAEL KHODORKOVSKIY, THE SOLIDITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA SEEMS RATHER SHAKY. THIS HAS TRANSLATED INTO A TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS SINCE RUSSIA'S RATIFICATION OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION IN 1998. VARIOUS FACTORS EXPLAIN THIS TENSION, INCLUDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE JUDICIARY, THE STATUS OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION IN RUSSIA LAW, PUBLIC MISTRUST OF THE COURTS, AND ONGOING EPISODES OF ARMED CONFLICTS. THIS HAS POSED ENORMOUS CHALLENGES TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND EVEN THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE IT ARE UNLIKELY TO TRIGGER BETTER COMPLIANCE IN RUSSIA.
69	THIS ESSAY DEVELOPS A CRITIQUE OF MODERN CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACHES TO NORMS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORY. IT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN A BEHAVIOURIST AND A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE ON NORMS. THE FORMER EXPLAINS COMPLIANCE WITH NORMS AND/OR NORM DIFFUSION VIA THE LOGIC OF APPROPRIATENESS AND THE LOGIC OF ARGUING, RESPECTIVELY, THE LATTER UNDERSTANDS DIVERGENCE IN NORMATIVE MEANING VIA THE LOGIC OF CONTESTEDNESS. USING HABERMAS'S APPROACH TO FACTS AND NORMS AS A FRAMEWORK, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITIES OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE BASED ON CORE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEIR ROLE IN CONTEXTS BEYOND THE MODERN NATION-STATE.
70	USING A PROPRIETARY DATA SET ON INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITY, WE STUDY THE DETERMINANTS OF BUYOUT INVESTMENTS ACROSS 61 COUNTRIES AND 19 INDUSTRIES OVER THE PERIOD OF 1990 TO 2017. WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH CYCLICALLY STRONG ECONOMIES, MORE ACTIVE STOCK AND CREDIT MARKETS, AND BETTER RULE OF LAW EXPERIENCE MORE BUYOUT ACTIVITY. COUNTRIES ALSO RECEIVE MORE BUYOUT CAPITAL FOLLOWING INVESTOR PROTECTION AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT REFORMS. THE SET OF DETERMINANTS WE IDENTIFY APPEAR SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO BUYOUT INVESTMENTS, BECAUSE OTHER FORMS OF INVESTMENT SUCH AS FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, INVESTMENTS IN R&D, AND M&A ACTIVITY DO NOT RESPOND SIMILARLY TO THESE FACTORS.
71	THE MANNER IN WHICH TERRORISM TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED IS A MARK OF HOW CIVILISED A SOCIETY WE ARE, AND A LITMUS TEST OF OUR ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. TERRORISM TRIALS PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEXITIES AND SUBJECT MATTER AND THE HEIGHTENED PUBLIC CONCERN SURROUNDING TERRORIST OFFENCES. THE ROLE OF THE COURTS IS TO ENSURE A FAIR TRIAL WITHIN A REASONABLE TIMESCALE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF TERRORISM TRIALS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. WE CONTINUE TO LEARN FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE COMMON LAW WORLD WHO FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES.
72	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TWOFOLD. ON THE ONE HAND, IT TRIES TO EXPOSE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN POLICIES OF DISLOCATION AND OUTSOURCING OF MIGRATORY CONTROLS AND TO DESCRIBE THE RISKS THAT SUCH POLICIES ENTAIL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN NORMS ON INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION. ON THE OTHER HAND, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SERIOUS RISK OF EVASION OF RULE OF LAW CONTROLS THAT SUCH POLICIES ENTAIL, IT IS ATTEMPTED TO FIND IN THE CASE LAW OF EUROPEAN COURTS AND, ABOVE ALL, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ELEMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW REBUILD THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES SO ELUDED.
73	UNDER THE IUS COGENS AND EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION PRECEPTS, THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES TWO DIFFERENT ASPECTS: A) THE POSSIBILITY TO ATTEMPT SOLVING A DISPUTE THROUGH MEDIATION AS A PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT WHEN FILING A LEGAL ACTION; AND B) THE NEED TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LITIS FAIR COMPOSITION, AND THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDIATION IS NOT FREE FROM OBSTACLES; EVEN IF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION IS NOT AN OBSTACLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF CONFLICT MEDIATION IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE NECESSARY LEGAL SECURITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW SO THAT THE FINAL RESULT IS NONE RESPECTING THE PRINCIPLES AND LIBERTIES OF CONSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED RIGHTS.
74	IN THIS PAPER, WE TEST THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED BY NORTH, WALLIS, AND WEINGAST (2009), WHO POSIT THAT LIMITED-ACCESS SOCIETIES NEED TO MEET THREE DOORSTEP CONDITIONS BEFORE THEY CAN TRANSIT INTO OPEN-ACCESS SOCIETIES: (1) ESTABLISHMENT OF RULE OF LAW AMONG ELITES, (2) ADOPTION OF PERPETUALLY EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS, AND (3) POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE MILITARY. WE IDENTIFY INDICATORS REFLECTING THESE DOORSTEPS AND ECONOMETRICALLY TEST THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPECIFIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC VARIABLES. WE BROADLY CONFIRM THE LOGIC BEHIND THE DOORSTEPS AS NECESSARY CONDITIONS IN THE TRANSITION TO OPEN-ACCESS SOCIETIES. THE DOORSTEPS INFLUENCE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROCESSES, AS WELL AS EACH OTHER, WITH VARYING INTENSITIES.
75	THE CAPACITY TO ACT COLLECTIVELY IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF GROUPS SHARING INTERESTS, INCENTIVES AND VALUES (OR BEING SUFFICIENTLY SMALL), AS STANDARD ECONOMIC THEORY PREDICTS, BUT A PRIOR AND SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF PROBLEM(S) AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. FROM THIS STANDPOINT, THE FAILURE TO ACT COLLECTIVELY CAN STEM AT LEAST IN PART FROM RELEVANT GROUPS FAILING TO ASCRIBE A COMMON INTERSUBJECTIVE MEANING TO SITUATIONS, PROCESSES AND EVENTS. WE DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL ACCOUNT OF INTERSUBJECTIVE MEANINGS, EXPLAIN ITS RELEVANCE TO DEVELOPMENT PRACTICE AND RESEARCH, AND EXAMINE ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK RELATED TO BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND MANAGING COMMON POOL RESOURCES.
76	GIVEN THE CENTRALIZATION OF POWER IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA, CAN NONEXECUTIVE INSTITUTIONS EXERCISE SOME POWER, ESPECIALLY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS HIGH COURTS, WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW? IN PARTICULAR, CAN HIGH COURTS INFLUENCE THE RUSSIAN PUBLIC THROUGH THEIR POWER TO PERSUADE? USING EXPERIMENTS EMBEDDED IN THREE SURVEYS OF MORE THAN 6,000 RUSSIANS EACH, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE SUPREME AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, AS WELL AS THE DUMA, HAVE PERSUASIVE POWER BUT GREATER POTENTIAL TO PERSUADE TOLERANT RUSSIANS TO BE INTOLERANT THAN VICE VERSA. THE FINDINGS HAVE POWERFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF MINORITIES.
77	WHAT HAS BEEN THE SCOPE OF THE CHANGES MADE IN RUSSIA'S LEGAL SYSTEM AND JUDICIARY SINCE PERESTROIKA? THOROUGHGOING CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE. SOVIET LAW HAS YIELDED TO A NEW LAW THAT, OVERALL, SEEMS ADAPTED TO THE TRANSITION TOWARD A MARKET ECONOMY, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY, LAUNCHED IN 1991, HAS CREATED NEW JURISDICTIONS (IN CONSTITUTIONAL AND TRADE LAW, IN PARTICULAR) AND INCREASED THE INDEPENDENCE AND PROFESSIONALIZATION OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS. HOWEVER THESE CHANGES HAVE ENCOUNTERED SERIOUS LIMITS, SOME OF THE LATTER DUE TO AN ATTACHMENT TO THE SOVIET LEGACY, OTHERS TO THE INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION PAID TO DEVELOPING PUBLIC LAW.
78	THE STUDY FOCUSES ON THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE JUSTICE DEALING WITH THE RESULTS OF MEASURING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SAFETY AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTION, WORKS, OR SERVICES. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE ERROR (UNCERTAINTY) THAT APPEARS IN SUCH SITUATIONS IS A MEASURE OF DATA SCATTER AND A SOURCE OF LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, WHICH CAUSES A RISK OF JUDICIAL ERRORS. THE LEVEL OF SUCH RISK INCREASES WITH INCREASING DEMANDS OF ECONOMY TO THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE EVER-DECREASING VALUES OF CHARACTERISTICS EVALUATED WITH HIGHER UNCERTAINTY. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN SUCH CASES IS THE RISK-ORIENTED APPROACH TO RESOLVING ARBITRATION CASES.
79	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON FDI SPILLOVERS CONSIDERING FIRM HETEROGENEITY AND VARIOUS SPILLOVER MECHANISMS. WE TEST OUR HYPOTHESES USING DATA ON CHINESE MANUFACTURING FIRMS FROM 1998 TO 2013. WE FIND THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION LOWERS THE POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION EFFECT OF FDI ON LOCAL PRODUCTIVITY, WHILE SUCH NEGATIVE EFFECT IS SMALLER FOR LOCAL FIRMS WITH HIGHER TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETENCE. GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE REDUCES THE NEGATIVE COMPETITION EFFECT OF FDI ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF LOCAL FIRMS AND THIS EFFECT IS EVEN STRONGER FOR STATE-OWNED FIRMS. FOR FIRMS WITH HIGH RELATIONSHIP-SPECIFICITY, VERTICAL SPILLOVERS THROUGH THE BACKWARD AND FORWARD LINKAGES ARE LARGER IN REGIONS WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW.
80	CHILE HAS A LONG RECORD OF PUBLIC PROBITY, REPRESENTING AN EXCEPTION IN LATIN AMERICA. IT GOES BACK TO THE LATE COLONIAL PERIOD WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS RULED BY RELATIVELY EFFICIENT AND HONEST GOVERNORS. DURING THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, CHILE BUILT UP A SOLID STATE AND A STABLE POLITICAL SYSTEM, BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. CHILEANS HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE AWARE OF THE EXCEPTIONALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY IN TERMS OF THE STRENGTH OF THEIR POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE SCRUPULOUSNESS OF THEIR RULERS. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC PROBITY IN CHILE, EMPHASIZING THE WAYS SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEALT WITH THE CORRUPTION ISSUE SINCE DEMOCRATIC RESTORATION IN 1990.
81	ANNOTATION. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDIA EDUCATION AND MEDIA AND INFORMATION LITERACY, ALONG WITH THE PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION AND LEGAL CULTURE OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THE QUESTION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COMPLEMENTARY DEVELOPMENT OF THESE AREAS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACHIEVING SYNERGIES IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY, KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW WITH THE CENTERS OF ETHICAL AND LEGAL INFORMATION AND MEDIA EDUCATION ON THE BASIS OF LIBRARIES OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AS ELEMENTS OF THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE, PROVIDING INCLUDING PROBLEM SOLVING THE CREATION OF SPECIALIZED INFORMATION RESOURCES AND FREE ACCESS TO THEM.
82	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACTS OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT ON INTERNATIONAL TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS. QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IS CONCEPTUALIZED IN TERMS OF AN ABSENCE OF CORRUPTION, A WELL-ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW AND BUREAUCRATIC EFFICIENCY. BASED ON THE CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS OF THE TRAVEL & TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS INDEX (WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM, 2013), THE MAIN FINDING OF THE STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS AND THAT THIS POSITIVE EFFECT REMAINS ROBUST ACROSS A NUMBER OF CONTROL VARIABLES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC POLICY FOR BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL TOURISM INDUSTRY SHOULD BE NESTED IN THE BROADER PROJECT OF ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT.
83	FOR YEARS, THE RUSSIAN HEAD OF STATE HAS OBJECTED TO CRITICISM OF HIS CONTEMPT FOR DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. BUT NOW THE KREMLIN HAS GONE ON THE OFFENSIVE. RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN CLAIMS NOT ONLY AN INDEPENDENT WAY FOR RUSSIA, HE HAS DECLARED HIS COUNTRY GUARDIAN OF "TRADITIONAL VALUES". THE ATTEMPT TO EVOKE RUSSIA'S 19TH-CENTURY ROLE AS "GENDARME OF EUROPE" IS OBVIOUS. THUS THE KREMLIN IS ALSO FINDING NEW ALLIES, NAMELY ON THE RIGHT OF WESTERN EUROPE'S POLITICAL SPECTRUM. THE SEARCH FOR PARTNERS FOR A LONG-TERM DEMOCRATIC COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT IN RUSSIA HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT. THIS SEARCH MUST NOT BE ABANDONED.
84	THE UNITED NATIONS PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENT, IN THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2002, NOTES THAT MANY GOVERNMENTS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED TEND TO HOLD THEIR AUTHORITY BY NON-DEMOCRATIC METHODS, FOR EXAMPLE, BY MODIFYING THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION IN THEIR FAVOR OR INTERVENING IN ELECTORAL PROCESSES AND SUBTRACTING INDEPENDENCE TO THE LEGISLATIVE OR JUDICIARY. MANY OF THESE FACTS HAVE OCCURRED REPEATEDLY IN VENEZUELA. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEFINE, EMPIRICALLY, THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN VENEZUELA, TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A CLEAR POLITICAL REGIME, THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANTIVE ACCESS TO THE STATE, THE RULE OF LAW AND CERTAIN FORM OF ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY.
85	THE FOCUS OF THE TRANSITIONAL PROCESSES IN GEE STUDIES HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS. ONE IMPORTANT STUDY AREA IN THE TRANSITIONAL PROCESSES IN GEE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE ECONOMY STRUCTURE AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMPETITIVENESS OF COMPANIES IS INDIVIDUAL COMPETENCY MANAGEMENT. ESPECIALLY IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES LIKE SLOVENIA, HUMAN RESOURCES HAVE TO BE REGARDED AS A KEY FACTOR FOR THE CURRENT AND FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE STUDY RESULTS THAT INCLUDE MANAGERS' OPINIONS REGARDING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL DRIVERS OF CHANGE AND INFLUENCING COMPETENCY MANAGEMENT IN SLOVENIA.
86	THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING KOSOVO IN 2008 ARE CONSIDERABLE. ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN BELOW THE RATE ACHIEVED IN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE WORK FORCE IS UNEMPLOYED. THE PAPER APPLIES A 'DIAGNOSTICS' ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY THE MOST BINDING CONSTRAINTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION. THE BINDING CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH ARE FOUND TO BE THE COSTS AND ACCESS TO FINANCE, POOR PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT POLICY OPTIONS FOR JOB CREATION MUST FOCUS ON INCREASING BOTH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE EMPLOYMENT INTENSITY OF GROWTH. COPYRIGHT (C) 2009 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
87	TO FIGHT CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019, NON-PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE ADOPTED ALL OVER THE WORLD. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTION (NPI) EFFECTIVENESS ALSO DEPENDS ON GOVERNMENTS' CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT SOUND POLICIES. STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS ARE BINDING MEASURES THAT CAN RAISE SERIOUS CONCERNS AMONG THE POPULATION. THE PERCEIVED QUALITY AND EFFECTIVE NEED FOR THESE MEASURES ARE THEREFORE CRUCIAL FOR THE WILLINGNESS OF THE CITIZENS TO ACCEPT NPIS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EFFICACY OF NPIS AND GOVERNANCE QUALITY IN CENTRAL ASIA. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT OVERALL GOVERNANCE QUALITY MATTERS AND THAT IN THIS RELATIONSHIP REGULATORY QUALITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RULE OF LAW, WHICH MATTERS MORE THAN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS.
88	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES A PARTICULAR FORM OF CIVIL SOCIETY MOBILISATION IN THE EU ACCESSION PROCESS. DESPITE WIDELY VARYING MODELS OF CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUSION ACROSS THE WESTERN BALKANS, MONITORING COALITIONS FOCUSED ON RULE OF LAW ISSUES HAVE EMERGED IN A MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES. COMPARING THE CASES OF CROATIA, MONTENEGRO, AND SERBIA, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THIS PHENOMENON CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY EXTERNAL EU INCENTIVES ALONE, BUT IS SIGNIFICANTLY SHAPED BY THE DYNAMICS OF TRANSNATIONAL DIFFUSION. THE FINDINGS OFFER A FULLER PICTURE OF THE FORCES SHAPING CIVIL SOCIETY MOBILISATION IN ACCESSION COUNTRIES AND HOLD IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR THE EU'S INVOLVEMENT IN STRENGTHENING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS ON THE GROUND.
89	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE RESPONSE OF LOCAL ACTORS TO THE PHAETON INCIDENT OF 1808 TO ILLUSTRATE HOW AMBIGUOUS DISTRIBUTION OF MILITARY RESPONSIBILITY IMPEDED EFFECTIVE MARITIME DEFENSE IN TOKUGAWA JAPAN. BY SITUATING THE RESPONSE AS A PRODUCT OF THE EVOLUTION OF MILITARY ORGANIZATION IN NAGASAKI DATING TO 1640, THIS ESSAY OFFERS A NEW PICTURE OF THE HARBOR'S SECURITY AS A DELIBERATE, LONG-TERM SYSTEM INSTEAD OF AD HOC RESPONSES TO PERIODIC THREATS. FINALLY, IT EXPLORES HOW THE POST-PHAETON FOCUS ON MATERIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HARBOR DEFENSES, INSTEAD OF MORE PRECISELY DEFINING MILITARY ORGANIZATION, REFLECTED TENSIONS BETWEEN CUSTOM AND RULE OF LAW PERVADING THE TOKUGAWA STATE.
90	VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL ORDERS: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING RECORDED HUMAN HISTORY (CAMBRIDGE 2009) OFFERS A THEORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN STATE AND AN EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS FRAMEWORK "FOR INTERPRETING RECORDED HUMAN HISTORY." THE BOOK RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLITICAL STRUCTURING OF VIOLENCE, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF POLITICAL ORDER. IN DOING SO, IT SPEAKS TO A RANGE OF POLITICAL SCIENTISTS FROM A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGICAL AND SUBFIELD PERSPECTIVES. WE HAVE THUS INVITED FOUR PROMINENT POLITICAL SCIENCE SCHOLARS OF VIOLENCE AND POLITICS TO COMMENT ON THE BOOK: JACK SNYDER, CAROLINE HARTZELL, JEAN BETHKE ELSHTAIN, AND LARRY DIAMOND.
91	ACADEMIC ANALYSES OF CRIME AND POLICING IN LATIN AMERICA HAVE GENERALLY FOCUSED ON THE FAILURE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO GUARANTEE A RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY, HOWEVER, ARGUES THAT THE PERSISTENTLY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE IN RIO'S FAVELAS [SHANTYTOWNS] RESULT NOT FROM THE FAILURE OF INSTITUTIONS BUT, RATHER, FROM NETWORKS THAT BRING CRIMINALS TOGETHER WITH CIVIC LEADERS, POLITICIANS, AND POLICE. THESE CONTACTS PROTECT TRAFFICKERS FROM STATE REPRESSION AND HELP THEM BUILD POLITICAL SUPPORT AMONG THE RESIDENTS OF THE WHERE THEY FAVELAS OPERATE. RATHER THAN CREATING 'PARALLEL STATES' OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL CONTROL, THEN, THESE NETWORKS LINK TRAFFICKER DOMINATED FAVELAS INTO RIO'S BROADER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEM.
92	A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF STEVEN HORWITZ'S CAREER WAS HIS EMPHASIS UPON THE EMANCIPATORY CHARACTER OF ECONOMIC LIBERALISM AND MARKET ACTIVITY. MARKET ENVIRONMENTS SUPPORTED BY LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTRACTUAL FREEDOM, AND THE RULE OF LAW, HAVE NOT ONLY FACILITATED MATERIAL PROGRESS BUT CORRODED SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND PROMOTED THE WELFARE OF OPPRESSED AND DISADVANTAGED PEOPLES. THIS PAPER ARTICULATES THREE COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH ECONOMIC LIBERALISM SERVES EMANCIPATORY FUNCTIONS: INCLUSIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ACCOMMODATIVE CHANGES IN CAPITAL AND PRODUCTION STRUCTURES; AND INSTITUTIONS FACILITATING MARKET ENTRY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION. HORWITZ'S EMANCIPATORY LIBERALISM IS ILLUSTRATED WITH REGARD TO HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
93	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS IN MOZAMBIQUE, FROM THE APPROVAL OF THE FIRST MULTIPARTY CONSTITUTION IN 1990 UP TO THE LAST GENERAL ELECTIONS IN 2014. MORE PRECISELY, THROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS, A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT CHARACTERIZED THE 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 AND 2014 GENERAL ELECTIONS IS CARRIED OUT. THE MAIN ARGUMENT THAT SUPPORTS OUR PAPER IS THAT, ALTHOUGH ELECTIONS DO PERIODICALLY TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY, ALTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS SINCE THE PROMULGATION OF THE FIRST MULTIPARTY CONSTITUTION, THERE ARE STILL MANY CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS WITH REGARDS TO THE BUILDING OF A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
94	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PRESENT A DEFENSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEMOCRACY TO FIGHT THE INVISIBILITY OF VULNERABLE GROUPS. TO THIS END, THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD WAS ADOPTED STARTING FROM A BROAD CONSTRUCTION ON THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW AND SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND THEN TO APPLY IT TO THE CONTEXT OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXCLUSION OF PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS BRAZIL. AS A RESEARCH TECHNIQUE, BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH WAS ADOPTED FOR THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORK. AS A CONCLUSION, THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE NEED FOR THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS AS A SOCIAL TRANSFORMERS, SINCE ENVIRONMENTAL STRUGGLES ARE INSEPARABLE FROM SOCIAL STRUGGLES.
95	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE DETERMINANTS OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (ETR) SUPPORTED BY INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES, USING PANEL DATA FROM 21,638 LISTED COMPANIES IN 63 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1999-2009. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE ETR DEPENDS ON BUSINESS AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FACTORS. NAMELY, SIZE, LEVERAGE, FIXED ASSETS, INVENTORIES AND PROFITABILITY ARE EXPLANATORY FACTORS OF THE ETR. THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT, OECD MEMBERSHIP AND THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE ETR, WHILE THE REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW NEGATIVELY AFFECT TAX BURDEN. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS VARIABLES DETERMINING THE ETR IS CONDITIONED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS LOCATED.
96	WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS, POLICE-RELATED ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME A KEY COMPONENT OF THE OSCE'S POST-CONFLICT REHABILITATION OPERATIONS AND HAVE GAINED INCREASING RELEVANCE IN THE ORGANIZATION'S DEMOCRATIZATION AND RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES IN STATES OF TRANSITION AS WELL AS IN THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED CRIME. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE WIDE SCOPE OF POLICE-RELATED ACTIVITIES THE OSCE EXECUTIVE STRUCTURES HAVE UNDERTAKEN, THE ACHIEVEMENTS THEY HAVE MADE, THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE FACED WHILE DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THEIR POLICE ASSISTANCE AND REFORM PROGRAMMES, AND THE STRATEGIES THEY HAVE DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES.
97	MAX WEBER'S THESIS OF THE VITAL LINK BETWEEN FORMAL LEGAL RATIONALITY AND CIVILIZED POWER RESTS ON CONSIDERATIONS OF PRUDENCE THAT REMAIN COMPELLING. YET HIS RESIGNATION TO INJUSTICE AS PART OF AN UNDIFFERENTIATED TRAGEDY OF EXISTENCE GOES TOO FAR IN IGNORING ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS A MORE ADEQUATE APPROACH BY FIRST EXPLICATING WEBER'S APPROACH THROUGH HIS OWN DISCUSSION OF SANCHO PANZA AS EXEMPLAR OF THE HAZARDS OF SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE AND THEN SUGGESTING HOW TO MOVE BEYOND WEBER'S CONCLUSIONS BY FAKING UP JUDITH SHKLAR'S SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW A DEMOCRATIC POLITICS OF CONSENT AND DISSENT CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY HEED INJUSTICE AND MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW.
98	THE VALUES OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY ARE SOMETIMES NECESSARILY IN CONFLICT, AND ONE MAY BE COMPROMISED IN DEFENSE OF THE OTHER. THE HISTORY OF NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CAN BE SEEN AS A CONTINUING PRAGMATIC ATTEMPT TO BALANCE FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND IDEALS AGAINST ELEMENTS OF THEIR DEFENSE THAT HAVE AT TIMES INTRUDED UPON THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS, AND POPULAR PARTICIPATION IN POLICY DEBATE AND DECISION MAKING BY AN INFORMED CITIZENRY. THE BALANCING OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND DEMOCRACY IS AN ONGOING PROCESS, BUT THE LONG-TERM TREND IN THE UNITED STATES SEEMS TO BE TOWARD AN INCREASING EMPHASIS ON DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
99	EUTHANASIA IS AN ANCIENT THEME THAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY BECAME THE HEALTH PARADIGM IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES, HAS AROUSED DEEP REFLECTIONS AND DECLARED DISSENSIONS BETWEEN SOCIO-IDEOLOGICAL QUADRANTS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPATHY AND MORALITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED SEVERAL TIMES OVER RECENT CENTURIES. STUDIES AND OPINION ARTICLES PRESENT DISPARATE CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THIS RELATION, MAINLY BECAUSE A HETEROGENEOUS, NEBULOUS AND SOMEWHAT MALADJUSTED CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO HUMAN NATURE HAS PREVAILED. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARGUE THAT CONSIDERING DIVERSITY AS THE FUNDAMENTAL AXIOLOGICAL AXIS OF A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, EMPATHY IS ESSENTIAL TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO THE MOST DIVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH AN ETHICAL-LEGAL DECISION IS PENDING, AS IN EUTHANASIA.
100	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGITIMACY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CRIME IN MEXICO. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE CASE OF MICHOACAN, MEXICO, USING CORRELATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS ESTABLISH A LINK BETWEEN THE LACK OF LEGITIMACY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CRIME RATE. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE VIEW THAT THE STRUCTURAL CAUSES OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN MEXICO ARE NOT DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND OF DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS ALWAYS EXISTED, BUT TO THE ACCUMULATION OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS WHICH HAVE IMPEDED THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT FROM ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SITUATION IS MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.
101	THROUGH A CASE STUDY ON BEIJING'S NO. 4 METRO LINE, THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES BENEFITS, COSTS, OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS IN PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPP) IN CHINA. IT DESCRIBES THE PROCESS TO LAND A CONCESSION AGREEMENT; DEMONSTRATES THE CONSEQUENCES FOR REVENUE AND COSTS FROM USING A PRIVATE ENTREPRENEUR; AND ESTIMATES THE BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BY USING A PPP MODEL, THE PUBLIC SECTOR MAY SAVE UP TO 31% OF ITS INITIAL INVESTMENT AND 9.4% OF TOTAL EXPENSES DURING THE CONCESSION. THE PRIVATE INVESTOR MAY EARN A PROFIT, BUT BEARS A RISK DUE TO ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
102	IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST FIFTY YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A THOROUGH-GOING REAPPRAISAL OF THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE, SO LONG THE TARGET OF DERISION OR VICTIM OF NEGLECT. VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF ITS HISTORY BETWEEN THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA IN 1648 AND ITS FINAL DEMISE IN 1806 HAS BEEN REVISED. THE EMPIRE IS NOW LAUDED FOR BEING A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH SUCCEEDED IN PROTECTING GERMAN LIBERTIES AND ASSERTING GERMAN NATIONALITY. IT ALSO PROVIDED AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH GERMAN CULTURE COULD FLOURISH AS NEVER BEFORE. IT PROVED LESS EFFECTIVE, HOWEVER, IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PROTECTING ITS CITIZENS AGAINST RAPACIOUS NEIGHBOURS.
103	RENEWED INTEREST IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1990S FOCUSED NEW ATTENTION OIL THE ROLE OF JUSTICE SECTOR INSTITUTIONS SOCIAL CHANGE. IF ROBUST INSTITUTIONS AND SETTLED RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT, THEY ARE ALSO ELUSIVE, HENCE THE NEED FOR REFORM. YET LAW REFORM SUFFERS FROM A "KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT" ABOUT ITS NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES. AND ITS TARGET SETTINGS. QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF LAW REFORM ESPECIALLY IN STRATIFIED SOCIETIES. THIS PAPER LOOKS TO THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE TO EXPLORE THESE ISSUES, AND ASKS TO WHAT EXTENT EXISTING REFORMS ADDRESS THE JUSTICE NEEDS OF THE RURAL POOR. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
104	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEXICAN POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE JUDICIARY PROVIDED AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REGIME LEGITIMATION, AS IT ALLOWED FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF A STATE OF LEGALITY AND A CLAIM TO CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, AT LEAST IN DISCOURSE. HOWEVER, THE JUDICIARY WAS IN EFFECT POLITICALLY SUBORDINATED TO THE LOGIC OF DOMINANT PARTY RULE THROUGH BOTH SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS SINCE 1917 THAT WEAKENED THE POSSIBILITY OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND A POLITICS OF INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL CO-OPTATION. THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF 1994 HAS SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE SUPREME COURT.
105	THE AUTHORITIES IN A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEED FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS THAT ARE USED IN ONLINE SERVICES. THE INTRODUCTION OF REGULATIONS AIMED AT SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS IS FREQUENTLY PROPOSED AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM OF ALGORITHM TRANSPARENCY. THESE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MUST BE FULFILLED BY THE DEVELOPERS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, CAN BE ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT LEGISLATIVE REGULATION, USERS CONTINUE TO ENCOUNTER THE POSSIBILITY THAT A SOCIAL NETWORK FEED OR A SEARCH SERVICE RESULT MAY PRESENT CONTENT THAT IS UNEQUAL OR UNCLEAR. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LOGIC BEHIND THESE RECOMMENDATIONS IS NOT CLEAR AND IS CONCEALED BY IT GIANTS. THE FOLLOWING ARE AMONG THE MAIN PROVISIONS OF LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES: THE LIABILITY OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO PUBLISH THE MECHANISMS OF RECOMMENDATION SERVICES, THE RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE USER ABOUT THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE USER TO REFUSE SUCH PROCESSING. STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND ARE APPROACHING IT FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS. EACH REGION CHOOSES WHAT TO PRIORITIZE IN TERMS OF THE LAW. WE SEE THAT FOR CHINA AND EUROPE, ALL AREAS OF PLATFORMS ARE IMPORTANT, WHEREAS FOR RUSSIA, NEWS PLATFORMS AND VIDEO HOSTING ARE OF INTEREST AND FOR INDIA, SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PLATFORM CATEGORY. HOWEVER, IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE RECOMMENDATION ENGINE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ARE EXPANDING. THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS WELL AS THE ORDER IN WHICH IT IS DISCLOSED ARE BOTH VARIABLE. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE APPROACHES TAKEN BY VARIOUS COUNTRIES.
106	CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOWS IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN DIGITAL ECONOMY. ARTICLE 12.14 (2) AND ARTICLE 12.15 (2) IN RCEP STIPULATE THE PROHIBITIVE NORMS ON DATA LOCALIZATION, AIMING TO ENSURE THE DATA IS TRANSFERRED FREELY. EXCEPT SOME OTHER CLAUSES INDIRECTLY STIPULATE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EXCLUDING THE USE OF THE PROHIBITIVE NORMS, ARTICLE 12.14 (3) AND ARTICLE 12.15 (3) DIRECTLY STIPULATE THE EXCEPTION CLAUSES OF DATA LOCALIZATION, I.E., THE CLAUSE OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY, HORIZONTAL PROVISIONS, AND CLAUSE OF THE ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS. THE WTO CASE-LAWS SHOW THAT THE AFORESAID CONCEPTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED BY THE PARTIES ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN REALITY. THE NORMS ON "ANTI-DISCRIMINATION" AND "ANTI-DISGUISED RESTRICTION" ARE TO PREVENT THE "CLAUSE OF LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY" FROM BEING ABUSED. TO UNDERSTAND THESE NORMS, WE NEED TO EVALUATE THE SUBSTANTIVE PURPOSES OF THE CONCRETE MEASURES LAUNCHED BY THE STATES, AND THEN CLARIFY THE RELATIONS BETWEEN AFORESAID PURPOSES AND THE LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVE.
107	CARBON CAPTURE, UTILIZATION AND STORAGE (CCUS) HAS BEEN APPLIED IN MANY COUNTRIES AND HAS PROVEN TO BE A KEY CARBON-REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FUTURE. CHINA CURRENTLY EMITS THE MOST CARBON, AND PRIOR RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THE HIGH POTENTIAL OF CCUS TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE COUNTRY'S EMISSION-REDUCTION PROCESS. CHINA INTRODUCED CCUS TECHNOLOGY AT THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY AND HAS SINCE IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF RELATED POLICIES. THIS PAPER COMPARES THE DEVELOPMENT STATUS OF CCUS IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES, STUDIES THE LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF CCUS IN CHINA, AND ANALYZES THE DEFECTS IN RELEVANT LAWS AND POLICIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA'S CURRENT LEGAL AND POLICY SYSTEM IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF CCUS; SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS NO SPECIAL LAW, AND THE POLICY SYSTEM IS INCOMPLETE. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADVANCE AND GIVE FULL PLAY TO THE EMISSION-REDUCTION EFFECT OF CCUS. TO PROMOTE CCUS DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA, THIS PAPER PROPOSES CORRESPONDING COUNTERMEASURES, INCLUDING FORMULATING A SPECIAL LAW, PERFECTING THE CCUS POLICY SYSTEM, EXPANDING GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL SUPPORT, AND IMPROVING CCUS PUBLIC AWARENESS AND SUPPORT.
108	IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF CARBON PEAKING AND CARBON NEUTRALIZATION, WE MUST VIGOROUSLY DEVELOP RENEWABLE ENERGY. AS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES, THE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF BIOMASS ENERGY HAS A HIGH COST, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH TRADITIONAL FOSSIL ENERGY IN THE EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ESCORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIOMASS ENERGY INDUSTRY THROUGH LEGAL MEANS. FIRST OF ALL, ON THE BASIS OF FULLY ANALYZING THE DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS OF CHINA'S BIOMASS ENERGY, THE ARTICLE SORTS OUT THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO BIOMASS ENERGY IN CHINA, AND FINDS THE SHORTCOMINGS. SECONDLY, THIS PAPER DRAWS ON THE INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITED STATES, BRAZIL, SWEDEN AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITH RELATIVELY DEVELOPED BIOMASS ENERGY INDUSTRY, AND PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT FROM THREE ASPECTS: LAW, POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM, WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMASS ENERGY INDUSTRY AND REALIZING THE "DUAL CARBON TARGET" THEORETICALLY.
109	ON 10 SEPTEMBER 2018, THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS OF CHINA UPDATED ITS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND PLANNED TO ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE DATA PROTECTION LAW BY MARCH 2022. THIS PLAN WOULD END THE LONGSTANDING SPECULATION AMONG CHINESE SCHOLARS AND FOREIGN OBSERVERS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF CHINA'S DATA PROTECTION REGIME. NEVERTHELESS, WHETHER SUCH A LAW CAN BE ENACTED ON TIME REMAINS UNCERTAIN. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CURRENT CHALLENGES TO THE CREATION OF A WORKABLE DATA PROTECTION LAW IN CHINA. THE MAIN CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO THE HASTY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES, THE CURRENT WEAK LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND THE UNPREPARED SCHOLARS AND LAWMAKERS. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE ENACTMENT OF A DATA PROTECTION LAW IS NOT AN EASY TASK. THIS TASK IS LIKELY TO BE DELAYED, SUSPENDED, OR PROVED TO BE A FAILURE IF THE AFOREMENTIONED OBSTACLES ARE NOT RESOLVED PROPERLY. FINALLY, TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL DATA PROTECTION, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES FOUR BASIC POLICY AND LEGAL RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) PAY MORE ATTENTION TO PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS' PERSONAL DATA AGAINST UNREASONABLE USE BY INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT; (2) CAUTIOUSLY LEARN FROM LEGISLATIVE EXPERIENCE OF WESTERN COUNTRIES; (3) EXPLORE THE BEST PRACTICES UNDER CHINESE CONTEXTS; AND (4) ENFORCE THE PROTECTION RULES IN A MORE MEANINGFUL MANNER.
110	IN SEPTEMBER 2017, CHINA SIGNED THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON CHOICE OF COURT AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE NO OBSTACLES PREVENTING CHINA FROM RATIFYING THE CONVENTION. HOWEVER, THE POSSIBLE RESERVATIONS CHINA MAY DECLARE APPEAR TO BE A KEY CONCERN FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE CONVENTION. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE KEY CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CONVENTION AND CHINESE LAW AND PRACTICE, AND ANALYSES THE PROS AND CONS OF SOME POSSIBLE RESERVATIONS THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES MAY CONSIDER WHEN RATIFYING THE CONVENTION. CHINA'S RATIFICATION OF THE CONVENTION WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL JUDGMENTS. ALTHOUGH CHINA MAY HAVE SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS (E.G. NATIONAL SECURITY) IN ITS RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF PARTICULAR FOREIGN JUDGMENTS, IT IS DESIRABLE THAT CHINA ADOPTS A PRAGMATIC APPROACH AND MINIMIZE THE NUMBER AND EXTENT OF ITS RESERVATIONS TO THE CONVENTION.
111	THE AUTHOR ANALYSES LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN INDIVIDUAL AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ENCOMPASSES VIEWS, BELIEFS, IDEAS REGARDING THE LAW. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS FOR SUSTAINING THE RULE OF LAW AND ORDER IN THE COUNTRY, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DYNAMICS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT. IT IS STRESSED THAT THE EVER-INCREASING PACE OF MODERN SOCIETY'S DEVELOPMENT (THE GLOBALIZATION AND INFORMATIZATION PROCESSES IN PARTICULAR) LEADS TO A LOSS OF MANY LONG-ESTABLISHED VALUES, MORAL AND LEGAL GUIDELINES, WHICH RESULTS IN A DEEP CRISIS IN BOTH SPIRITUAL AND PUBLIC RELATIONS, INCLUDING THE SPHERE OF STATE AND LAW. SINCE THE WORST PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCE OF A DEFORMED LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS MANIFESTED IN SPECIFIC ACTIONS IS THE ACT OF CRIME, THE AUTHOR STUDIES THE WAYS OF REDUCING THE LEVELS OF SUCH A DEFORMATION, WHICH COULD BE USED AS PART OF THE COMPLEX APPROACH TO CRIME PREVENTION. THE AUTHOR HAS CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF CITIZENS SERVING PRISON SENTENCES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENCES AND COMPARED ITS RESULTS WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL FOR CITIZENS WITHOUT A CRIMINAL RECORD. BASED ON THIS RESEARCH, THE AUTHOR HAS DETERMINED THE STAGE OF A PERSON'S UPBRINGING/EDUCATION/ACTIVITY AT WHICH IT IS REASONABLE TO START FORMING THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE. HOWEVER, THE RESEARCH RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT A PERSON'S EDUCATION IS NOT A GUARANTEE AGAINST BREAKING THE LAW, THAT IS WHY, TO ENSURE THE RIGHT GUIDELINES REGARDING THE VALUE AND NECESSITY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ORDER, THE AUTHOR PRESENTS A COMPLEX OF MEASURES TO RAISE THE LEVEL OF A PERSON'S LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WILL THEN BE LESS PRONE TO DEFORMATION.
112	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AS A GOLDEN MEAN APPROACH OF JUDICIARY IN PROTECTING AND PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS FROM ILLEGITIMATE INTERFERENCES OF GOVERNMENT. WITH THIS AIM, SEVERAL CASE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON VERDICTS OF HIGHER JUDICIARY IN BANGLADESH. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS PAPER IS AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY FOCUSED ON BANGLADESH. THE PAPER IS QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND BASED ON SECONDARY SOURCES OF PUBLISHED FACTS LIKE BOOKS, JOURNAL ARTICLES AND DHAKA LAW REPORTS. INFORMATION ALSO GATHERED THROUGH INTERNET BROWSING. FINDINGS - THOUGH JUDICIARY IS VERY EFFECTIVE TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY THROUGH JUDICIAL ACTIVISM OR PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION, THE ROLE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) ARE CRUCIAL IN BANGLADESH. DELAY AND DISPOSAL OF CASES IS ONE OF THE GREAT IMPEDIMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF ENSURING HUMAN RIGHTS IN BANGLADESH. BESIDES, NEGLIGENCE IN IMPLEMENT THE VERDICT OF JUDICIARY AND INTERFERENCES OF EXECUTIVE OVER JUDICIARY IS ANOTHER FINDING OF THIS PAPER. APART FROM THESE SHORTCOMINGS, JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IS A VERY IMPORTANT POTENTIAL INSTRUMENT OF JUDICIARY TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN BANGLADESH. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE MAJOR LIMITATION OF THIS PAPER IS IT IS BASED ON SECONDARY SOURCES OF INFORMATION. IT WOULD HAVE MORE RICH IF PERIODICAL DATA CAN BE USED FOR COMPARING THEORY AND PRACTICE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS PAPER WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR MAKING A POLICY FOR OVERCOMING LIMITATIONS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN BANGLADESH TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - SOCIAL AWARENESS CAN BE BUILD-UP THROUGH NGOS AND READERS BY DISSEMINATING AND PENETRATING INFORMATION OF THIS PAPER'S FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER WOULD AN UNIQUE AND ADD NEW KNOWLEDGE IN THE LITERATURE OF PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF BANGLADESH.
113	THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT ("RFRA") EXCUSES BELIEVERS FROM FEDERAL LAWS THAT "SUBSTANTIALLY BURDEN" THEIR RELIGIOUS EXERCISE, UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOWS THAT THE LAW FURTHERS A COMPELLING INTEREST IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MANNER. WHO DECIDES IF A BURDEN IS "SUBSTANTIAL"? RFRA CLAIMANTS ARGUE THAT THEY DO. WHETHER A BURDEN IS "SUBSTANTIAL" IS TYPICALLY DISAGGREGATED INTO TWO SUB QUESTIONS: WOULD THE CLAIMANT SUFFER SUBSTANTIAL RELIGIOUS PENALTIES FROM COMPLYING WITH A LAW, AND SUBSTANTIAL SECULAR PENALTIES FROM VIOLATING IT? COURTS MAY DECIDE THE SECOND QUESTION, BUT NOT THE FIRST, BECAUSE THE "RELIGIOUS-QUESTION" DOCTRINE BARS THEM FROM ADJUDICATING THEOLOGICAL ISSUES. COURTS MAY DETERMINE WHETHER CLAIMANTS ARE "SINCERE" IN ALLEGING SUBSTANTIAL RELIGIOUS PENALTIES, BUT NOT WHETHER THOSE PENALTIES ARE TRULY "SUBSTANTIAL." REVIEW OF CLAIMANT SINCERITY AND SECULAR PENALTIES, HOWEVER, LEAVES THE CRUCIAL JUDGMENT OF SUBSTANTIALITY ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF RFRA CLAIMANTS. ONE NEED NOT CHALLENGE THE SINCERITY OF RFRA CLAIMANTS TO QUESTION THIS ARRANGEMENT. IT MAKES NO LEGAL SENSE TO ENTRUST THE QUESTION OF SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN TO PERSONS SO SELF-INTERESTED IN THE ANSWER, HOWEVER SINCERE THEIR BELIEF A BEDROCK PRINCIPLE OF ANGLO-AMERICAN DUE PROCESS HOLDS THAT NO ONE MAY JUDGE HER OWN CASE. EXEMPTION BOUNDARIES MUST BE TENDED BY COURTS, NOT EXEMPTION BENEFICIARIES, LEST THE RULE OF LAW BE SWALLOWED BY A SEA OF SELF-INTERESTED YET FUNCTIONALLY UNREVIEWABLE EXEMPTION CLAIMS. THE SUPREME COURT'S DISPOSITION OF THE RELIGIOUS NONPROFIT CHALLENGES TO THE CONTRACEPTION MANDATE IN ZUBIK V. BURWELL LEFT UNDECIDED WHETHER COURTS MAY ADJUDICATE THE SUBSTANTIALITY OF BURDENS ON RELIGION IN LIGHT OF THE RELIGIOUS-QUESTION DOCTRINE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT COURTS MAY ADJUDICATE THIS ISSUE BY RELYING ON NEUTRAL PRINCIPLES OF SECULAR LAW, AND THAT THEY MUST DO SO TO IMPLEMENT RFRA'S PURPOSE AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW.
114	THERE ARE A NUMBSER OF REASONS SUGGESTING THAT IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS THE MOST VITAL ROLE FOR NATIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING OR ARE EXPECTED TO FACE A NATURAL RESOURCE CURSE TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. BASED ON THIS DEBATE, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIVE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF SUCH QUALITIES - INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (THAT IS, INDEX OF RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, VOICE ACCOUNTABILITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS) - IN MENA COUNTRIES USING A CROSS-SECTIONAL AND TIME SERIES DATA FROM PERIOD OF 1996-2019. IN THE LIGHT OF THIS, THE MAIN VARIABLE CONSIDERED IS EFFECTS OF NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS HUMAN FACTOR AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON REAL GDP PER CAPITA. TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULT, PANEL MODEL TECHNIQUES WAS EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE THE RESULTS, WHICH REVEALED THAT NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS AND HUMAN CAPITAL HAVE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WITH REAL GDP PER CAPITA WHILE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS, HENCE DIMINISHES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRY. ALSO, VOICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE REAL GDP, WHILE THE OTHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, EXCEPT REGULATORY QUALITY, HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION IN INCREASING THE REAL GDP. THE INTERACTING EF-FECTS OF NATURAL RESOURCE AND VOICE ACCOUNTABILITY FOSTER THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND IT ALSO HAVE IMPACT IN INCREASING THE SIZE OF NATURAL RESOURCES, AND HUMAN CAPITAL ON THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF MENA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME VANISHES THE INITIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH. MOREOVER, INTERACTION OF NATURAL RESOURCE RENT ON POLITICAL INSTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAVE ALL SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF MENA WHILE REGULATORY LAW IS OF NO SIGNIFICANT. BASED ON THIS, IDEAL POLICY DIRECTIONS WERE HIGHLIGHTED.
115	JURISTS ARE TRAINED TO VALUE THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDGES ARE EXPECTED TO UPHOLD SAME WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SEPARATION OF POWERS CONTROLS INTERACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES, CREATING POTENTIAL FOR FRICTION WHERE THE LEGALITY OR LEGITIMACY OF STATE ACTION IS AT STAKE. THE REAL TEST OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE COMES IN SITUATIONS OF CRISIS. JUDGES ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS OR POLITICIANS. STILL, ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS, JUDGES ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS THAT HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES ON A HUMAN LEVEL, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY ENGAGES A JUDGE'S CONSCIENCE. CHANGING VALUES SHAPE THE FACE OF JUSTICE; AND WITH THE RISE OF POPULISM, THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN A DEMOCRACY HAS BECOME A MAJOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION. DETRACTORS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM DISMISS SUCH ELITIST THINKING PARTICULARLY AS IT IS EXPRESSED BY UNELECTED MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY. PROPONENTS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM REPLY THAT JUDICIAL RESTRAINT HAS NO PLACE WHERE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE THREATENED. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN A JUDGE WITH THE FEDERAL COURT OF CANADA SINCE 2002. IN THIS ESSAY, HE PROPOSES A REDEFINITION OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND ACTIVISM. JUDICIAL COURAGE BETTER DESCRIBES THE REALITY OF JUDICIAL INTERVENTION WHICH IS FAR FROM BEING UNIDIMENSIONAL. FACED WITH TWO OPPOSITE VIEWS OF JUDICIAL COURAGE, AND NATURALLY INCLINED TO FOLLOW A LIBERAL ONE-ACCORDING TO WHICH COURAGE, VIRTUE AND INTEGRITY ARE TIGHTLY INTERTWINED-THE AUTHOR ALSO TESTS A CONSERVATIVE DUTY-BASED APPROACH CENTERED ON RULES AND PRECEDENTS. THROUGHOUT A HISTORICAL JOURNEY, TACKLING WITH ETHICAL CHALLENGES SHAPING THE FACE OF TODAY'S JUSTICE, A JUDGE TRIES TO FIND HIS OWN EXISTENTIAL MEANING. IN THE END, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE TRUE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE LIES IN THE JUDGE'S CAPACITY TO VALUE PERSONS IN THEIR HUMANITY WHILE KEEPING THE RULE OF LAW AT THE CENTER OF HIS OR HER JUDICIAL LIFE.
116	THE PAPER ANALYZES THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC INTEGRITY STANDARDS WITHIN THE ROMANIAN PARLIAMENT, IN THE RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE AND IN TERMS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY MANDATE LEGITIMACY. THE SUBJECT IS APPROACHED IN THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT EUROPEAN COMMISSION VERIFICATION AND COOPERATION MECHANISM (CVM) REPORTS ON ROMANIA, FOCUSING ON THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY AND HIGH LEVEL CORRUPTION LIMITATION MEASURES. THE STUDY USES DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES: (1) AN ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION SUFFICIENCY REGULATING MPS IN-COMPATIBILITIES AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS, (2) THE TRANSPARENCY LEVEL OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE TERMINATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY MANDATE, (3) AND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK'S MOST IMPORTANT EVOLUTIONS, IN TERMS OF MPS INTEGRITY STANDARDS. THE STUDY PRESENTS A CRITICAL OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT AMENDMENTS ISSUED BY MPS, IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC INTEGRITY FRAMEWORK AND TO RESTRAIN THE LEGAL COMPETENCES OF THE NATIONAL INTEGRITY AGENCY (NIA). THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE ANALYSIS BRINGS AN ADDITIONAL INSIGHT RELATED TO LEGISLATION STABILITY AND LAW IMPLEMENTATION, IN TERMS OF THE FINAL COURT DECISIONS ENFORCEMENT. RECENT CVM REPORTS ON ROMANIA (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2014, 2015, 2016, AND 2017) EMPHASIZE THAT POLITICAL WILL AND POLITICAL COMMITMENT ARE DECISIVE FOR THE SUCCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND IRREVERSIBILITY OF CURBING CORRUPTION PUBLIC POLICIES AND STRATEGIES. THE ARTICLE ALSO INQUIRES THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MAIN PRIORITIES OF NATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGY (NAS) (2016-2020), IN TERMS OF PROMOTING LEGISLATION STABILITY AND ADOPTING A CODIFICATION OF PUBLIC INTEGRITY STANDARDS. THE PAPER TRIES TO EVALUATE THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL COMMITMENT OF THE PARLIAMENT TOWARDS THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTEGRITY LEGISLATION AND IRREVOCABILITY OF ANTICORRUPTION STRATEGIES AND PUBLIC POLICIES. THE CONCLUSIONS PROPOSE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF RAISING PUBLIC INTEGRITY STANDARDS. ALSO, THE STUDY ASSESSES THE VIABILITY OF CVM REMOVAL HYPOTHESIS AND INQUIRES THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES ON RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES OF SUCH A SCENARIO.
117	TRADITIONAL ACCOUNTS OF CLIENTELISM TYPICALLY FOCUSED ON PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONS WITH MINIMAL SCOPE FOR CITIZEN AUTONOMY. DESPITE THE HEIGHTENED AGENCY OF MANY CONTEMPORARY CITIZENS, MOST STUDIES CONTINUE TO DEPICT CLIENTELISM AS A PHENOMENON THAT IS FIRMLY UNDER ELITE CONTROL. THE PREVAILING TENDENCY IS TO VIEW CLIENTELISM AS A TOP-DOWN PROCESS IN WHICH MACHINES TARGET CITIZENS WITH OFFERS OF MATERIAL BENEFITS. WITHOUT DENYING THE IMPORTANCE OF ELITES, WE EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF CITIZEN DEMANDS IN CLIENTELISM. CITIZENS OFTEN APPROACH MACHINES OF THEIR OWN VOLITION TO ASK FOR HELP AND MAY VOTE FOR A COMPETITOR IF REQUESTS ARE UNFULFILLED. IN RESPONSE TO THESE CITIZENS, MACHINES OFTEN ENGAGE IN WHAT WE CALL REQUEST FULFILLING. INTERVIEWS WITH CITIZENS AND POLITICIANS, COUPLED WITH CROSS-NATIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA, SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PHENOMENON. IN ADDITION, ARGENTINE SURVEY DATA IN STUDIES BY STOKES AND NICHTER ARE BETTER EXPLAINED BY REQUEST FULFILLING THAN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS.
118	ONE OF THE MOST INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS IN THE DEBATE AROUND MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW WHILE COMBATING THE THREAT OF TERRORISM IS THE QUESTION OF SECRECY AND TRANSPARENCY. IN PEACETIME, IMPORTANT TENETS TO THE RULE OF LAW INCLUDE TRANSPARENCY OF THE LAW, LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT POWER, AND CONSISTENCY OF THE LAW AS APPLIED TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE POLITY. YET THE POST-9/11 DECISION-MAKING BY THE BUSH AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY EXCESSIVE SECRECY THAT STYMIES MOST EFFORTS TO HOLD THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS ABUSES. EXECUTIVE BRANCH POLICY WITH REGARD TO DETENTION, INTERROGATION, TARGETED KILLING, AND SURVEILLANCE ARE KEPT SECRET, AND THAT SECRECY HAS BEEN LARGELY VALIDATED BY A COMPLIANT JUDICIARY THAT HAS DISMISSED ALMOST ALL SUITS CHALLENGING HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS ABUSES RESULTING FROM COUNTERTERRORISM PROGRAMS. EFFORTS BY CONGRESS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT HAVE MET WITH MIXED RESULTS; IN THE AREA OF GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE, SUCH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF LEAKED INFORMATION ON WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE BY GOVERNMENT INSIDERS. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS GENERALLY REFUSED TO MAKE PUBLIC VITAL ASPECTS OF ITS SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS IN WAYS THAT COULD GIVE OVERSIGHT EFFORTS MORE MUSCLE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS CONSISTENTLY DEFENDED THE LEGALITY AND EFFICACY OF THESE SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE NATURE AND EFFECT OF THE WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES SINCE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND DISCUSSES SURVEILLANCE-RELATED POWERS AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND INDIA AS COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES. THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER QUESTIONS WHETHER ACCOUNTABILITY OVER GOVERNMENT ABUSES IN THIS AREA EXIST IN AN EFFECTIVE FORM, OR IF GOVERNMENTS HAVE CONSTRUCTED A POST-9/11 LEGAL ARCHITECTURE WITH REGARD TO SURVEILLANCE THAT ENGENDERS EXCESSIVE SECRECY AND RENDERS ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS LARGELY MEANINGLESS.
119	ONE OF THE MAJOR GLOBAL CHALLENGES THAT MOST AFFECT THE WORLD ECONOMIES ARE GEOPOLITICAL RISKS TRIGGERED BY TENSIONS ARISING FROM EXPLOITING NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE INFLUENCES OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, THE RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) ON NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) AND MIDDLE EAST & NORTH AFRICA (MENA). WE APPLY A NEW PANEL QUANTILE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE TO PANEL DATA FROM 62 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2021. THE RESULTS SHOW, IN GENERAL, IN BOTH MENA AND SSA ECONOMIES, THERE IS A NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. THIS IS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE ABSENCE OF POPULAR PARTICIPATION AND TRANSPARENCY IN DECISION-MAKING, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM, LOW GOVERNMENT EFFICACY, LOW-QUALITY REGULATION, LACK OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND HIGH CORRUPTION IN THESE REGIONS. THUS, GOVERNANCE QUALITY COULD BE THE DRIVER OF GEOPOLITICAL RISKS IN RESOURCE-RICH ECONOMIES. THIS STUDY ADDS TO THE LITERATURE ON GEOPOLITICAL RISK BY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE ON NATURAL RESOURCE INCOME IN THE MENA AND SSA REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, IT IS THE FIRST STUDY TO COMPARE TWO REGIONS, WITH MANY COUNTRIES, REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS. IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DETERIORATION OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED REVENUES FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, WHICH INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS. HIGHER QUALITY AND MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE REQUIRE LESS COMPLEX, MORE TRANSPARENT, AND LESS CONTRADICTORY REGULATIONS, REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS. PRACTICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DRAWN FROM THE FINDINGS TO HELP THE MENA AND SSA ECONOMIES OVERCOME GEOPOLITICAL RISKS.
120	IN THE SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH ARE DOCTRINAL (SCIENTIFIC) CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES. THE LATTER ARE UNDERSTOOD AS THE MOST GENERAL, EXTREMELY BROAD LEGAL GENERALISATIONS (CONCEPTS), REFLECTING THE MAIN PROPERTIES OF PHENOMENA OF STATE-LEGAL REALITY. IT IS ARGUED THAT DOCTRINAL CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES SHOULD, FIRSTLY, CORRESPOND (NOT CONTRADICT) TO LEGAL (OFFICIAL) CONCEPTS; SECONDLY, IN THEIR CONTENT HAVE THE SO-CALLED STATE-LEGAL COMPONENT REFLECTING THE INTERACTION OF THE STATE AND POSITIVE LAW. THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM, LEGAL REGULATION AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE ANALYSED AS EXAMPLES OF LEGAL CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES. THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE MOST VOLUMINOUS LEGAL CATEGORY, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF THE STATE'S ACTIVITY AND IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN GOALS. THESE PROVISIONS SERVE AS A BASIS TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE VIEWS OF SCHOLARS WHO INCLUDE IN THE CONTENT OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND NEGATIVE LEGAL PHENOMENA (LEGAL NIHILISM, OFFENCES, THE LOOSENESS OF LAW, ITS INCONSISTENCY, ETC.). IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS AN ELEMENT OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY, WITH THE HELP OF WHICH THE STATE MAKES ITS DICTATES BINDING, IMPLEMENTS ITS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS. THE STATE-LEGAL COMPONENT IS CONTAINED IN THE CONCEPT OF "LEGAL REGULATION", BEARING IN MIND THAT MODERN STATES, IN CARRYING OUT LEGAL REGULATION, MOST OFTEN CREATE NORMS OF POSITIVE LAW THEMSELVES, BUT IN SOME CASES RESORT TO SANCTIONING THOSE NORMS OF LAW CREATED BY NON-STATE ORGANISATIONS OR GIVE LEGAL FORCE TO CERTAIN NON-LEGAL NORMS. WITH REGARD TO THE CATEGORY OF LAW AND ORDER, IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE LEADING SUBJECT OF ESTABLISHING AND PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW IS THE STATE. THEREFORE, THERE ARE REASONS TO OPERATE WITH SUCH A CATEGORY AS STATE-LEGAL ORDER.
121	THE CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY REFERRED TO AS THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW CONTAINS THE CATALOGUE OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RIGHTS SPECIFIED IN THIS CATALOGUE OF LAW IS CONSIDERED AS IMMEDIATE DIRECTLY APPLICABLE LAW AND IS BINDING FOR ALL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR ITS LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS DIRECTLY CONCERN TAX LEGISLATION WITH A SPECIAL INFLUENCE ON LEGAL AND ECONOMIC LIFE OF SOCIETY. THE SPECIFICS OF THIS BRANCH OF LAW IS REFLECTED IN THE OPINIONS OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF GERMANY SHOWING THE NECESSITY OF STRICT CORRESPONDENCE OF TAX LEGISLATION FIXED IN THE CONSTITUTION BY FUNDAMENTAL LAW. A SPECIAL FOCUS IS GIVEN TO THE FIXED IN THE CONSTITUTION RIGHT TO EQUALITY (THE PRINCIPLE OF CHARGING TAXES IN PROPORTION TO THE ECONOMIC SOLVENCY, THE PRINCIPLE OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE NET TAXATION) AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY, PROTECTION OF FAMILY AND MARRIAGE). BESIDES, THE LAWS INCLUDING THE NORMS OF TAX LAW SHOULD MEET THE REQUIREMENTS RESULTING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW STATE SPECIFIED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW. THESE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE IN PARTICULAR THE OBLIGATORY PROCEDURE OF PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF TAX LAWS AND A PROPER LEVEL OF LEGAL CERTAINTY OF A LAW TO BE APPROVED AND THE BAN ON THE RETROACTIVE EFFECT ON TAX LAWS. THE PAPER OUTLINES THE GERMAN TAX LAW AND ITS SOURCES AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM OF TAX BODIES IN GERMANY, CLASSIFIES TAXES BY THE OBJECT OF TAXATION. THEN ON THE BASIS OF ANALYZING PRACTICE OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, SUPERIOR FINANCIAL COURT AND COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION, THE PAPER REVEALS THE RELEVANCE OF THE MAJOR LAWS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW STATE FOR GERMAN TAX LAW CONCERNING NATURAL PERSON TAXATION.
122	AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REFORMS IN CHINA'S HANGZOU, THE COST OF BUSINESS HAS REDUCED, THE CONFIDENCE OF HANGZHOU ENTERPRISES HAS SURVIVED THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO INCREASE. NEVERTHELESS, HANGZHOU'S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS SHORTCOMINGS, SUCH AS INSUFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY, TALENT, AND INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE. TWO UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS PERSIST: (I) HAS THE SMART BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT STIMULATED CORPORATE INVESTMENT BY REDUCING SYSTEM COSTS AND BOOSTING CORPORATE CONFIDENCE? (II) HOW DO THE COMMERCIAL CLIMATE'S SHORTCOMINGS IMPACT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTELLIGENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS COSTS/CONFIDENCE? WE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF A LOCAL SMART BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ON THE CORPORATE INVESTMENT SCALE IN HANGZHOU USING FACTOR ANALYSIS, CLUSTER ANALYSIS, LINEAR REGRESSION, AND PATH ANALYSES OF DATA FROM 297 FIRM MANAGERS. SMART GOVERNANCE IMPROVED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, FINANCING, AND RULE OF LAW. THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT PROMOTED INVESTMENT BY INCREASING BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND DECREASING INSTITUTIONAL COSTS. WEAK INTELLIGENT PROPERTY PROTECTION AND LEGAL FAIRNESS HINDERED THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF SMART GOVERNANCE ON BUSINESS CONFIDENCE AND SYSTEM COSTS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY COMBINING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, SMART CITY, AND SMART GOVERNANCE CONCEPTS TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL SMART BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS ON BUSINESS CONFIDENCE, INSTITUTIONAL COSTS, AND INVESTMENT. OUR CONCLUSION ON THE LIMITATION EFFECT OF INTELLIGENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ON ENTERPRISE INVESTMENT ATTEMPTS TO INSPIRE FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE INTERSECTION OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS AND SMART CITIES. THE LAW OF INTELLIGENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ATTRACTING INVESTMENT OBTAINED IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA, THE LARGEST DEVELOPING COUNTRY WITH DIVERSIFIED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. COUNTRIES CAN ATTRACT INVESTMENT AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INTELLIGENT GOVERNANCE. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SHOULD CONSTRUCT SMART SERVICE PLATFORMS, COORDINATE SUPERVISION OF PUBLIC CREDIT, REDUCE FINANCING CONSTRAINT, CONSTRUCT A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LAND MANAGEMENT, AND PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
123	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR OF FIRMS IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD 2009-2012. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - IT USES A BROAD SET OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE RATINGS BY THE WORLD BANK AND DATA ON ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR OF FIRMS BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM'S REPORT ON GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. FULL DATA OF A TOTAL OF 39 AFRICAN ECONOMIES OUT OF THE 54 (INCLUDING TWO DISPUTED) ECONOMIES OVER THE SAMPLE PERIOD WERE OBTAINED FOR THIS ANALYSIS. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FIND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRY-LEVEL RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY, AND FIRM ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR OF FIRMS IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES. THIS IMPLIES THAT IMPROVEMENT IN COUNTRY-LEVEL RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOUND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR OFFIRMSIN AFRICAN ECONOMIES. HOWEVER, THE AUTHORS DID NOT FIND ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRY-LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, OUTSIDER MODEL OF GOVERNANCE AND ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR OF FIRMS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - AS A CONTINENT THAT IS YET TO FULLY DISCOVER ITS POTENTIAL, THE PRACTICE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IS PARTICULARLY GERMANE, AS THIS MAY NOT ONLY HELP ENSURE SOUND ETHICAL STANDARDS OF CORPORATIONS, BUT MAY ALSO AID THE CONTINENT TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTORS, WHICH WILL BENEFICIALLY IMPACT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES. IN THIS RESPECT, EFFORTS BY GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE CONTINENT TO ENSURING GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE LAUDABLE. ONE POSSIBLE WAY IS TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS TO STIMULATE COMPLIANCE IN A SPECIFICALLY CLEAR-CUT MANNER BY CRAFTING COSTS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE (FOR INSTANCE, LEGAL COSTS, INVESTIGATION COST, IMPRISONMENT, DENT TO IMAGE AND FINES). ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER REINFORCES THE BELIEF THAT THE EXISTENCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOOD GOVERNANCE COULD PROVIDE AND ENHANCE COHESIVE AND INTERNALLY CONSISTENT ETHICAL STANDARDS OF COMPANIES.
124	CRITICAL LEGAL ORIENTALISM IS A TALE OF TWO EMPIRES, THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE UNITED STATES ESTABLISHED A SPECIAL U.S. COURT FOR CHINA, THUS INCORPORATING CHINA AS THE LARGEST DISTRICT OF THEIR JURISDICTION. THIS EXTRATERRITORIAL COURT OPERATED FOR ABOUT A CENTURY AND ADVANCED AN AMERICAN LEGAL IMPERIALISM IN CHINA THAT CONTINUES TODAY. IT IS AN EMPIRE FOUNDED ON THE NOTION OF CHINA AS A PLACE WHERE LAW ACTUALLY DOES NOT EXIST BECAUSE NEITHER ITS SUBJECTS NOR ITS STATE LIVES UP TO THE RULE OF LAW. SUCH WESTERN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CHINA AND ITS LEGAL TRADITION ARE CALLED "LEGAL ORIENTALISM." COMPARATIVE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS INTRODUCED THIS CONCEPT AND ERECTED A CRITIQUE OF U.S. LAW AND FOREIGN POLICY AROUND IT. IN THE CHINESE RECEPTION, THIS WESTERN SELF-CRITICISM HAS TAKEN A POLITICAL TURN. HERE, LEGAL ORIENTALISM FEEDS INTO AN IMPERIAL NARRATIVE, WHICH IS NO LESS AMBITIOUS THAN ITS AMERICAN COUNTERPART FOR IT ALLOWS DISCREDITING CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE LEGAL PRACTICE AS AN ORIENTALIST MISREADING. RULE OF LAW CRITICISM IS THEREBY SILENCED, AND THIS EXTENDS THE SPACE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY CALLED CHINA'S "NEW ERA." THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL ORIENTALISM, AS WE KNOW IT TODAY, IS NOT READY TO ADDRESS SUCH A POLITICAL TURN OF LEGAL ORIENTALISM. IT HAS NO UNDERSTANDING OF ITS OWN CRITICAL POSITION BEYOND A WESTERN SELF-CRITICISM. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS THE OUTLINES OF A CRITICAL LEGAL ORIENTALISM. IT ARGUES THAT LEGAL ORIENTALISM WILL BE A CRITICAL PROJECT OF COMPARATIVE SCHOLARSHIP ONLY IF IT REFLECTS ON ITS OWN POSITION; AND THIS INCLUDES REFLECTING ON ITS POLITICAL, ETHICAL, AND NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS. A CRITICAL LEGAL ORIENTALISM THUS MARKS A DISCURSIVE POSITION THAT NEITHER SERVES TO REINVENT SELF-RIGHTEOUS EMPIRES NOR TO SILENCE IDEAS OF JUSTICE IN THEIR NAMES.
125	OF ALL THE AGENCIES OF EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT, THOSE THAT POLICE THAT EMPLOY FORCE AND ENGAGE IN SURVEILLANCE ARE THE MOST THREATENING TO THE LIBERTIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YET, THEY ARE THE LEAST REGULATED. TWO CORE REQUISITES OF AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY ENSURES THAT POLICY CHOICES ARE VETTED IN THE PUBLIC ARENA AND HAVE POPULAR SUPPORT; THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT THOSE CHOICES BE CONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL. LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENTS GOVERNING POLICING ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. ALTHOUGH POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE INTERNAL RULES, THESE RULES ARE RARELY MADE PUBLIC OR PUBLICLY DEBATED. WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING POLICING, WE RELY PRIMARILY ON EX POST JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHICH AT BEST ENSURES POLICING PRACTICES ARE CONSTITUTIONAL (THOUGH IT OFTEN FAILS ON THIS SCORE), AND DOES NOTHING TO ASSURE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY OR SOUND POLICYMAKING. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR POLICING TO REMAIN ALOOF FROM THE ORDINARY PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. ALL POLICE PRACTICES SUCH AS USE OF DRONES OR OTHER SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT; SWAT, TASERS, AND OTHER MEANS OF FORCE; CHECKPOINT STOPS, ADMINISTRATIVE INSPECTIONS, AND OTHER WARRANTLESS SEARCHES AND SEIZURES SHOULD BE LEGISLATIVELY AUTHORIZED, SUBJECT TO PUBLIC RULEMAKING, OR ADOPTED AND EVALUATED THROUGH SOME ALTERNATIVE PROCESS THAT PERMITS DEMOCRATIC INPUT. IN ADDITION TO SPELLING OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THE ORDINARY PROCESSES OF GOVERNANCE CAN BE UTILIZED TO REGULATE POLICING, THIS ARTICLE FILLS IN SUBSTANTIAL GAPS IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY ANALYZING WHY THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST, AND EXPLAINING HOW, WITHIN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, COURTS CAN MOTIVATE CHANGE. IT ALSO DIRECTS ATTENTION TO THE MANIFOLD QUESTIONS THAT REQUIRE RESOLUTION IN ORDER TO MOVE POLICING TO A MORE DEMOCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOOTING.
126	THE ISSUES OF ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION HAVE ALWAYS BEEN URGENT FOR THE RUSSIAN STATE. THEY GAIN SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE CONDITIONS OF PUBLIC LIFE DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A LAW-GOVERNED STATE WHERE THE SUPREME VALUES ARE HUMAN BEINGS, THEIR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE WORK OF FORENSIC INQUIRY DEPARTMENTS. CORRUPTION IN FORENSIC INQUIRY WORK IS MANIFESTED THROUGH THE DELIBERATE COMPILATION OF FALSE REPORTS RESULTING FROM THE DISTORTED PROCESS OF FORENSIC INQUIRY. THE IDENTIFICATION OF FALSIFICATIONS IN THE PROCESS OF FORENSIC INQUIRY AND THE CONFIRMATION OF DELIBERATE COMPILATION OF FALSE EXPERT REPORTS ARE DIFFICULT TASKS BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AN EXPERT'S MISTAKE AND AN ACTUAL FALSIFICATION OF INQUIRY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE CONCEPTS OF "EXPERT'S MISTAKE" AND "FALSIFICATION OF THE PROCESS OF FORENSIC INQUIRY" AND TO IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THE ACTUAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE INQUIRY PROCESS'S FALSIFICATION SIGNS IS A COMPLICATED BUT SOLVABLE PROBLEM. IT IS SOLVED BY EXAMINING THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONTRIBUTING TO THE DISTORTION OF THE PROCESS OF FORENSIC INQUIRY AND THE INFERENCE OF A DELIBERATELY FALSE CONCLUSION (TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE OBJECTS OF INQUIRY; ALTERATION OF THEIR INITIAL LOOK OR PROPERTIES; CONCEALMENT OF INFORMATION ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE INVESTIGATED OBJECT THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE THE INQUIRY CONCLUSIONS; DRAWBACKS IN THE RESEARCH PART OF THE REPORT, ITS INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND DISCORD WITH THE CONCLUSIONS; CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE INQUIRY RESULTS AND OTHER MATERIALS OF THE CASE; OBSOLETE INQUIRY METHODS OR METHODOLOGY). THE AUTHORS PRESENT A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT INCORPORATE THE METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF THE MEASURES TO COUNTERACT CRIMES OF CORRUPTION IN THE FORENSIC INQUIRIES CONDUCTED BY THE POLICE (ORGANIZING AND CONDUCTING FOLLOW-UP INQUIRIES).
127	THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S RULE OF LAW CAMPAIGN HAS CREATED GREATER AWARENESS OF LEGAL ISSUES AND GENERATED BOTTOM-UP PRESSURE FOR LEGAL CHANGE. THIS DYNAMIC WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN APRIL 2003, WHEN CHINESE MEDIA REPORTS ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN NAMED SUN ZHIGANG WHILE IN POLICE CUSTODY SPARKED A PUBLIC OUTCRY. THIS PUBLIC PRESSURE, COUPLED WITH A GROUND-BREAKING CITIZEN LEGAL CHALLENGE, EVENTUALLY PROMPTED CHINA'S STATE COUNCIL TO DISMANTLE A CONTROVERSIAL FORM OF ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION CALLED "CUSTODY AND REPATRIATION." THE SUN ZHIGANG INCIDENT DEMONSTRATED THAT BY LEVERAGING A WAVE OF MEDIA COVERAGE AND PUBLIC OPINION IN A CASE OF MASS CONCERN, COOPTING LAWS AND OFFICIAL RULE OF LAW RHETORIC, FORMULATING A TECHNICAL, WELL-GROUNDED LEGAL APPEAL WITHIN THE SYSTEM, AND FOCUSING ON MODEST LEGAL REFORM GOALS THAT DID NOT CHALLENGE FUNDAMENTAL STATE OR PARTY INTERESTS, LAWYERS COULD SUCCESSFULLY ACCELERATE LEGAL REFORM WITHOUT TRIGGERING THE TYPE OF DAMAGING BACKLASH DIRECTED AGAINST OTHER, MORE POLITICIZED CITIZEN ACTIONS. ALTHOUGH REFORMERS FAILED IN THEIR SECONDARY GOAL OF CREATING A PRECEDENT FOR NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ANNULMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION, THEIR EFFORTS HAD BROAD IMPACTS IN PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, GENERATING POLITICAL PRESSURE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT REFORMS, CREATING AN ENHANCED SENSE OF CITIZEN EMPOWERMENT, AND PROVIDING AREFINED MODEL FOR LAW-BASED CITIZEN RIGHTS ACTIONS. LEGAL ACTIVISTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED SIMILAR MODERATE LEGAL STRATEGIES IN SOME SUBSEQUENT CASES, WHILE MORE AGGRESSIVE, POLITICIZED TACTICS HAVE PROMPTED NEGATIVE STATE RESPONSES. OVERALL, THE CITIZEN ACTION STRATEGIES REFINED IN THE SUN ZHIGANG INCIDENT HAVE PROVIDED LEGAL REFORMERS WITH ONE PATH FORWARD FOR PROMOTING MODEST BUT MEANINGFUL LEGAL REFORM IN CHINA. RECENT GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE SCOPE AND POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SOME CITIZEN INITIATIVES WILL PROVIDE A KEY TEST OF THE DEGREE TO WHICH THIS REFORM MODEL IS SUSTAINABLE IN THE NEAR-TERM.
128	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY-NULLA POENA SINE LEGE. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM CONCERNING THE PRINCIPLE FAILS TO EXPRESS THE FULL RANGE OF VALUES AT STAKE IN PRESERVING THE RULE OF LAW. IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE THE DEEPER SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE VALUES, THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS AN APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY TO A DISPUTE ABOUT MENS REA RATHER THAN TO A CONTROVERSY ABOUT ACTUS REUS. THIS DISCUSSION HELPS TO REVEAL SOME OF THE LARGER ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PROTECTING THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. IN ADDITION, A FOCUS ON MENS MA INDICATES THE LIMITATIONS OF STATUTORY SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THE PRINCIPLE. FINALLY, THIS PERSPECTIVE DEMONSTRATES HOW THE RULE OF LAW SERVES TO PROTECT LAW-ABIDING PERSONS, AND NOT ONLY SCOUNDRELS. THE MOST GENERAL CONCLUSION DRAWN IS THAT FIDELITY TO LAW CANNOT BE CONSTRUED MERELY AS FIDELITY TO STATUTORY LAW, BUT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS FIDELITY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE THAT UNDERLIE STATUTORY LAW. THE DEEPER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY IS REVEALED IN THE CONTEXT OF A DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM OF WILFUL IGNORANCE. THE DISCUSSION BEGINS BY CLEARLY CHARACTERIZING THE CULPABLE MENTAL STATE ASSOCIATED WITH WILFUL IGNORANCE. THE UNSATISFACTORY TREATMENT OF WILFUL IGNORANCE BY BOTH COURTS AND COMMENTATORS IS THEN REVIEWED. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT SOME (BUT NOT ALL) WILFULLY IGNORANT DEFENDANTS ARE HELD LIABLE DESPITE THEIR FAILURE TO SATISFY THE MENS MA REQUIREMENT OF THE STATUTES UNDER WHICH THEY ARE CONVICTED. AFTER CONSIDERING WHETHER THE CULPABILITY OF SUCH DEFENDANTS IS EQUAL TO THAT OF DEFENDANTS WHO ACTUALLY SATISFY THE MENS REA OF THESE STATUTES, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEM OF WILFUL IGNORANCE SHOULD NOT BE ASSESSED APART FROM THE LARGER POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DRUG POLICY. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE LIMITATIONS OF PROPOSED STATUTORY SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF WILFUL IGNORANCE, AND DEFENDS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE.
129	THE SAFEGUARDING OF GENETIC INFORMATION IS ESSENTIAL, PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF SPORTS GENETICS TESTING. THIS RESEARCH DELVES INTO THE NUANCED DEFINITION OF GENETIC PRIVACY UNDER THE BACKDROP OF GENETIC TESTING IN SPORTS. WHILE MANY SCHOLARS REGARD GENETIC INFORMATION AS AN INHERENT COMPONENT OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY, IT IS CRUCIAL TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL GENETIC INFORMATION FALLS SQUARELY WITHIN THE REALM OF PRIVACY. DUE TO THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF GENETIC DATA, ONLY SPECIFIC SEGMENTS CAN BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF PRIVACY RIGHTS. ADDITIONALLY, GENETIC INFORMATION THAT PERTAINS TO FAMILY OR GROUP DYNAMICS TRANSCENDS THE BOUNDARIES OF INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY RIGHTS. IN CASES WHERE GENETIC INFORMATION IS SHARED AMONG MULTIPLE PARTIES, THE OWNERS DO NOT POSSESS UNILATERAL CONTROL OVER THESE SHARED GENETIC SEGMENTS. AS A NOVEL FACET OF PRIVACY RIGHTS, GENE PRIVACY INTRODUCES UNIQUE DIMENSIONS THAT DIFFER FROM CONVENTIONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS. IT ENCOMPASSES THE FIFTH RIGHT -THE RIGHT NOT TO KNOW SPECIFIC GENETIC INFORMATION. TO ESTABLISH A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF GENETIC PRIVACY, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERTAKE COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE RIGHT TO GENETIC INFORMATION PRIVACY. SUCH RESEARCH FORMS THE BEDROCK UPON WHICH A SCIENTIFICALLY INFORMED PATH TO JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF GENETIC PRIVACY IN THE SPORTS CONTEXT CAN BE DEVELOPED
130	SINCE THE END OF THE 20TH CENTURY, RESEARCH ABOUT THE TYPE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY. NEVERTHELESS, IN PREVIOUS STUDIES THERE WERE TWO NEGLECTED ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS; "WHY DOES THE DESIRE FOR CLEAN ENERGY VARY ACROSS THE COUNTRY?" AND "WHAT FACTORS INCREASE THE DESIRE FOR CLEAN ENERGY?". THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA AS A PROXY OF WELFARE ON THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO AMONG 75 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2018. HERE, THE ENERGY SOURCE FROM WHICH CARBON EMISSIONS ARE NEGLIGIBLE OR ZERO IS CALLED CLEAN ENERGY. IN CONTRAST, THE ENERGY SOURCE WITH SIGNIFICANT CARBON EMISSIONS IS CALLED DIRTY ENERGY. THE RESULTS OF THE RANDOM-EFFECT PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSION INDICATE POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF RULE OF LAW ON THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO. AS, IN THE FIRST DECILE (POLLUTED COUNTRIES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION) BY INCREASING ONE UNIT IN RULE OF LAW, THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO SHALL INCREASE BY 0.027. ALSO, WELFARE HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO. THEREFORE, IF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA INCREASES BY ONE UNIT (EQUAL TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS), THEN THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO WILL INCREASE BY 0.0022, IN THE FIRST DECILE. NEVERTHELESS, THE INITIAL CONDITIONS OF COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE EXISTENCE OF OIL OR GAS RESOURCES, THE CAPACITY TO GENERATE NUCLEAR POWER, AND THE EXISTENCE OF WATER RESOURCES ARE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTORS ON THE CLEAN TO DIRTY ENERGY CONSUMPTION RATIO. THEREFORE, ONE OF THE APPROPRIATE AND LONG-RUN POLICIES FOR THE TRANSITION FROM COMMUNITIES BASED ON DIRTY ENERGIES CONSUMPTION TO COMMUNITIES BASED ON CLEAN ENERGIES CONSUMPTION IS TO IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THE WELFARE LEVEL OF COMMUNITIES.
131	PURPOSE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR; YET FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED AN ANTECEDENT OF THESE EFFECTS: WHY SOME COUNTRIES ENJOY A POSITIVE IMAGE WHILE OTHERS SUFFER A NEGATIVE ONE. DEVELOPING AN INSTITUTIONAL THEORY OF COUNTRY IMAGE, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT WEAK LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL INCREASE FIRM OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOR THAT EXPROPRIATES CONSUMERS AND DECREASE THE PRODUCT QUALITY OF LOCAL BRANDS, THUS DECREASING THE COUNTRY'S IMAGE REGARDING ITS PRODUCTS AND BRANDS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY MEASURES COUNTRY IMAGE FOR PRODUCTS AND BRANDS USING THE NUMBER OF VALUABLE BRANDS (I.E. BRANDS INCLUDED IN THE TOP 500 BRANDS FROM 2008 TO 2016) IN A PARTICULAR HOME COUNTRY. DATA CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW IN EACH COUNTRY COME FROM THE WORLD BANK, AND DATA ON THE EFFICIENCY OF COUNTRIES' JUDICIAL SYSTEMS COMES FROM DJANKOVET AL.(2007). WE ALSO COLLECT PATENT DATA FROM THE US PATENT AND TRADE OFFICE, NATIONAL CULTURE FROM HOFSTEDE INSIGHTS AND GDP AND GDP PER CAPITA FROM THE WORLD BANK AS CONTROL VARIABLES. PANEL POISSON REGRESSION, TOBIT REGRESSION AND TRUNCATED REGRESSION ARE USED IN THE ANALYSES. FINDINGS SUPPORTING THE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY OF COUNTRY IMAGE, BOTH THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS SHOW POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON COUNTRY IMAGE, EVEN WHEN ECONOMY SIZE (GDP), DEGREE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (GDP PER CAPITA), LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY AND SKILL (PATENTS) AND CULTURE ARE CONTROLLED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR COUNTRY'S IMAGE AND THE BRAND VALUE OF LOCAL FIRMS, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AIMED AT PUNISHING FIRM OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOR IN THEIR COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN EFFECT HAS NOT YET APPRECIATED THE ROLE OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING THE CONSTRUCT OF COUNTRY IMAGE.
132	MANY COUNTRIES OF EMIGRATION ARE IN TRANSITION FROM CONFLICT TO PEACE AND FROM AUTHORITARIAN TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS. ADDRESSING POPULATION MOVEMENTS FROM THESE COUNTRIES REQUIRES MORE THAN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES; EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND, IN COUNTRIES RECOVERING FROM CONFLICT, RECONSTRUCTION OF DESTROYED INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING. OTHERWISE, FRAGILE PEACE AND DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES CAN EASILY BREAK DOWN, CREATING NEW WAVES OF FORCED MIGRANTS AND HAMPERING EFFORTS TOWARDS REPATRIATION AND REINTEGRATION OF ALREADY DISPLACED POPULATIONS. THIS BACKGROUND PAPER DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF FORCED MIGRATION, POINTING OUT THAT THE END OF THE COLD WAR HAS PRODUCED NEW PRESSURES AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THESE FLOWS. WHILE EXTREMISM, PARTICULARLY RAMPANT NATIONALISM, HAS PROVOKED MASSIVE FORCED MIGRATION IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE CHANGING GEOPOLITICAL RELATIONS HAS ALSO LED TO PEACE SETTLEMENTS IN SOME COUNTRIES AND HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION TO REDUCE SUFFERING IN OTHERS. ADDRESSING FORCED MIGRATION PRESSURES IN COUNTRIES IN TRANSITION REQUIRES COMPREHENSIVE POLICY APPROACHES. FOUR TYPES OF BEST PRACTICES ARE CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER. FIRST, MECHANISMS TO AMELIORATE THE CAUSES OF FORCED MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE ROLE THAT EXPATRIATE COMMUNITIES CAN PLAY IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY MINORITY RIGHTS. SECOND, MECHANISMS THAT ENHANCE REFUGEE PROTECTION WHILE MINIMIZING ABUSES OF ASYLUM SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ENHANCED RESPECT FOR THE REFUGEE CONVENTION, ADOPTION OF COMPLEMENTARY FORMS OF PROTECTION WHEN THE REFUGEE CONVENTION DOES NOT APPLY, STRENGTHENED REGIONAL PROTECTION, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF IN-COUNTRY PROCESSING OF REFUGEE CLAIMS. THIRD, MECHANISMS TO RESOLVE THE LONGER-TERM STATUS OF FORCED MIGRANTS, INCLUDING DECISIONS ON WHEN TO CEASE REFUGEE STATUS AND TEMPORARY PROTECTION AND ENCOURAGE/PERMIT RETURN OR INTEGRATION. FOURTH, MECHANISMS FOR MORE EFFECTIVE REPATRIATION WHEN RETURN IS POSSIBLE, PARTICULARLY PROGRAMS TO HELP RETURNEES REINTEGRATE AND COMMUNITIES RECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES.
133	GENDER DIVERSITY AND ITS IMPACT ON THE DECISIONS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAVE RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTION FROM THE ACADEMIA AND THE INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAS INCREASED, THEIR INFLUENCE ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE, WHILE IN LATIN AMERICA THERE ARE NO COMPARATIVE STUDIES THAT EVIDENCE THE CONTRIBUTION OF GENDER DIVERSITY TO ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. BASED ON AGENCY AND CRITICAL MASS THEORIES, THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF GENDER DIVERSITY ON THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS AND MUNICIPALITIES POSITIONS ON PUBLIC SPENDING DECISIONS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, INCLUDING CORRUPTION. THE STUDY SAMPLE IS MADE UP OF 18 COUNTRIES AND 378 OBSERVATIONS DURING THE 1997-2017 PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN ON THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS SHOWS AN IMPORTANT INCREASE IN LATIN AMERICA, THE 50-50 PARITY HAS NOT BEEN REACHED. ECONOMETRIC RESULTS SHOW THAT WOMEN IN NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS FAVOR GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, PARTICULARLY IN THE DIMENSIONS OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND NONVIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, WHILE ELECTED WOMEN MAYORS FAVOR THE REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, WOMEN MAYORS ENCOURAGE GREATER NON-SOCIAL SPENDING ON ECONOMIC ISSUES, WHILE INCREASING SOCIAL SPENDING ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, CULTURE AND RELIGION, AND SOCIAL PROTECTION. IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE, WOMEN MAYORS INCREASE TAX REVENUES AND TEND TO DECREASE TOTAL PUBLIC DEBT. THIS DOCUMENT CONCLUDES THAT WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR ARE MORE ORIENTED TOWARD SOCIAL ISSUES AND STRENGTHENING OF INSTITUTIONS, SINCE THEY TEND TO ADOPT AN ETHICAL ORIENTATION AND ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE NEEDS OF THE DIVERSE INTEREST GROUPS.
134	PURPOSE PRIOR STUDIES FIND THAT US FIRMS WITH MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES MAY MANIPULATE THE EARNINGS GAP TO OBSCURE HIGHER PERFORMING SEGMENTS TO COMPETITORS OR TO HIDE UNDERPERFORMING SEGMENTS FROM EXTERNAL MONITORS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPLEMENT EXTANT RESEARCH BY EXAMINING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES AND SEGMENT EARNINGS REPORTING OF CROSS-LISTED FIRMS IN THE USA AND THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS ON THIS ASSOCIATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IS THE EARNINGS GAP BETWEEN FIRM-LEVEL EARNINGS AND SUM OF SEGMENT-LEVEL EARNINGS. MANAGERIAL INCENTIVES ARE PROXIED BY PROPRIETARY COST AND AGENCY COST. PROPRIETARY COST IS MEASURED BY THE HERFINDAHL INDEX. AGENCY COST IS MEASURED BY INEFFICIENT RESOURCE TRANSFER ACTIVITIES ACROSS SEGMENTS. FOREIGN FIRMS IN THIS STUDY ARE COMPANIES LISTED ON MAJOR US STOCK EXCHANGES WITH HEADQUARTERS OUTSIDE THE USA. COMPARABLE US FIRMS ARE SELECTED USING THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING PROCEDURE AS A CONTROL GROUP. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND THAT 1) PROPRIETARY COST MOTIVE IS NOT THE DETERMINANT OF EARNINGS GAP REPORTING FOR CROSS-LISTED FIRMS; 2) CROSS-LISTED FIRMS MOTIVATED BY AGENCY COSTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO MANIPULATE SEGMENT EARNINGS REPORTING THAN US FIRMS; AND 3) AMONG CROSS-LISTED FIRMS MOTIVATED BY AGENCY COSTS, FIRMS IN WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES DEMONSTRATE MORE MANIPULATION IN SEGMENT EARNINGS THAN FIRMS IN STRONG RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE EXTANT RESEARCH WITH REGARD TO SEGMENT REPORTING EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES ON US FIRMS, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF SEGMENT REPORTING BY CROSS-LISTED FIRMS ORIGINATING FROM DIFFERENT LEGAL REGIMES. THIS STUDY FILLS THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE BY COMPARING CROSS-LISTED FIRMS TO US FIRMS IN THE REPORTING OF SEGMENT EARNINGS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR REGULATORS AND INVESTORS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN EVALUATING THE EXTENT OF CROSS-LISTED FIRMS' FINANCIAL REPORTING QUALITY.
135	IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, WHETHER THE PERFORMANCE OF REGULATED UTILITIES WITHIN A COUNTRY IS AFFECTED BY THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IS YET TO BE INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY. WE ANALYSE HOW THE QUALITY OF REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS IMPACT PERFORMANCE OF ITALIAN ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES. WE USE A STOCHASTIC FRONTIER ANALYSIS APPROACH TO ESTIMATE COST FUNCTIONS AND EXAMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF 107 ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES FROM 2011 TO 2015. THIS UNIQUE DATASET WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE HELP OF THE ITALIAN REGULATOR FOR ENERGY, NETWORKS, AND ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, WE USE A RECENT DATASET ON REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN ITALY. WE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT UTILITIES IN REGIONS WITH BETTER RESPONSIVENESS TOWARDS CITIZENS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW, TEND TO BE MORE COST EFFICIENT. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NATIONAL REGULATORS SHOULD TAKE REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY INTO ACCOUNT IN INCENTIVE REGULATION AND EFFICIENCY BENCHMARKING OF UTILITIES.

136	REASONING BY ANALOGY IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED TECHNIQUES OF LEGAL ARGUMENT. IN THIS ARTICLE, PROFESSOR BREWER PRESENTS A DETAILED MODEL OF THAT REASONING PROCESS. WITH ITS FOCUS ON THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF ANALOGIES THAT ARE OFFERED AS JUSTIFICATORY ARGUMENTS, PROFESSOR BREWER'S MODEL PROVIDES CLEAR CRITERIA THAT LAWYERS, JUDGES, STUDENTS, AND SCHOLARS CAN USE CRITICALLY TO ASSESS ANY GIVEN ARGUMENT BY ANALOGY. MOREOVER, CHALLENGING A WIDELY HELD VIEW, PROFESSOR BREWER USES THIS MODEL TO ARGUE THAT LEGAL REASONING BY ANALOGY, LIKE ANALOGICAL ARGUMENT IN LOGIC, MATHEMATICS, AND THE NATURAL SCIENCES, CAN HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RATIONAL FORCE WHEN PROPERLY EXECUTED. HE EXPLAINS THAT REASONING BY ANALOGY IS A THREE-STEP RULE-GUIDED PROCESS THAT LEGAL REASONERS TYPICALLY DEPLOY WHEN THEY ARE IN DOUBT ABOUT THE SCOPE OF A LEGAL CONCEPT OR RULE AND WANT TO USE ALE ANALYSIS OF EXAMPLES TO HELP RESOLVE THAT DOUBT. THE THREE-STEP PROCESS CONSISTS OF AN INFERENCE (OF THE TYPE KNOWN AS ''ABDUCTION'') FROM CHOSEN EXAMPLES TO A RULE THAT COULD RESOLVE THE DOUBT; CONFIRMATION OR DISCONFIRMATION, BY A PROCESS OF REFLECTIVE ADJUSTMENT, OF THE RULE THUS INFERRED; AND APPLICATION OF THE CONFIRMED RULE TO THE CASE THAT OCCASIONED THE DOUBT. PROFESSOR BREWER ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA THAT READERS OF ANALOGICAL ARGUMENTS SHOULD USE IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEIR EXACT STRUCTURE AND CONTENT. HE MAINTAINS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ANALOGICAL ARGUMENTS OFFERED BY JUDGES WHO ENDORSE CERTAIN WIDELY SHAVED RULE OF LAW VALUES SHOULD PRESUMPTIVELY BE INTERPRETED AS RELYING IN A SPECIAL WAY ON DEDUCTIVELY APPLICABLE RULES WITHIN THE BROADER THREE-STEP ANALOGICAL REASONING PROCESS; HIS DISCUSSION LOCATES ISSUES REGARDING THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL ANALOGIES WITHIN BROADER JURISPRUDENTIAL DEBATES OVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH LEGAL ARGUMENTS CAN, DO, AND SHOULD SATISFY RULE OF LAW VALUES.
137	CHARRON, NICHOLAS, DAHLSTROM, CARL, AND LAPUENTE, VICTOR NO LAW WITHOUT A STATE WHAT EXPLAINS CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OF ECONOMIC LIFE, AND IN DESIRABLE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES, SUCH AS A LOW DEGREE OF CORRUPTION AND HIGH DEGREE OF RULE OF LAW? IN SOME OF THE MOST WIDELY CITED PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE, SCHOLARS HAVE CLAIMED THAT SUCH CROSS-COUNTRY VARIATION IS EXPLAINED BY A COUNTRY'S LEGAL ORIGIN (COMMON LAW OR CIVIL LAW TRADITION). IT IS CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE OF STRONGER LEGAL PROTECTION FOR OUTSIDE INVESTORS AND LESS STATE INTERVENTION, COMMON LAW COUNTRIES HAVE ACHIEVED HIGHER LEVELS OF ECONOMY PROSPERITY AND SOCIAL LIFE THAN CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES. TO A LARGE EXTENT, THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN CORROBORATED BY MUCH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES OBSERVED. BUILDING ON SCHOLARLY STUDIES OF STATE FORMATION DEVELOPMENTS, THE BASIC PROPOSITION OF THIS PAPER IS THAT THE STATE FORMATION PROCESS AFFECTS THE CHARACTER OF THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE EITHER PATRIMONIAL OR BUREAUCRATIC, WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES. WE ARGUE THAT THIS FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION OF STATE FORMATION PRECEDES THE LEGAL ORIGINS OF A COUNTRY AND THUS OFFERS SUPERIOR EXPLANATORY POWER. THIS ARGUMENT IS TESTED EMPIRICALLY ON A SET OF 31 OECD COUNTRIES. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEED MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN THE LEGAL TRADITIONS ON A SET OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES (FORMALISM, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, REGULATION OF ENTRY AND CASE LAW) AS WELL AS ON A SET OF SOCIAL OUTCOMES (CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS).

138	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CRITICISM OF THE APOLITICAL STARTING POINT OF SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORIES THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF RAWLS'S ORIGINAL POSITION AND HABERMAS'S IDEA OF COMPLEX SOCIETY, ARGUING THAT SUCH DEPOLITICIZED STARTING POINT LEADS TO THE REFUSAL OF THE CENTRALITY OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES BETWEEN CLASSES AS THE BASIS OF STREAMLINING SOCIAL EVOLUTION AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL AGREEMENT, IT ERASES AND EVEN ELIMINATES THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN SOCIAL CLASSES, THE STATUS QUO AND THE SOCIAL-POLITICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOCIAL GROUPS AS THE CORE OF SOCIETAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATION. MOREOVER, IT LEADS TO STRONG INSTITUTIONALISM-THE CENTRALITY OF THE FORMAL SPHERES AND SUBJECTS (INSTITUTIONS, THEIR PROCEDURALISM AND LEGAL STAFF, AS POLITICAL PARTIES AND COURTS) IN RELATION TO INFORMAL SPHERES AND SUBJECTS (CIVIL SOCIETY, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND CITIZEN INITIATIVES). THEREFORE, THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A DEPOLITICIZED OR APOLITICAL STARTING POINT ARE THREEFOLD: (A) THE DEPOLITICIZATION OF SOCIAL STRUGGLES BETWEEN OPPOSED SOCIAL CLASSES, (B) THE STRONG INSTITUTIONALISM BY THE EMPHASIS IN THE DEPOLITICIZED INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND (C) THE WEAKENING OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PRAXIS PERFORMED BY SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND CITIZEN INITIATIVES FROM A DIRECT CONTRAPOSITION AND EVEN SUBSTITUTION OF THE INSTITUTIONS, THEIR PROCEDURALISM AND LEGAL STAFF WITH THE SPONTANEOUS POLITICAL-CULTURAL PRAXIS OF THESE SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND CITIZEN INITIATIVES. THE GREAT PROBLEM AND CHALLENGE OF CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES, NAMELY THE CORRELATION BETWEEN STRONG INSTITUTIONALISM, POLITICAL PARTIES AND ECONOMIC OLIGARCHIES, CANNOT BE RESOLVED FROM THE JURIDICAL-POLITICAL PROCEDURAL PARADIGM'S EMPHASIS ON INSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ONLY BY A REAFFIRMATION OF POLITICAL PRAXIS AS THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE OF INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIETAL CONSTITUTION, LEGITIMATION AND EVOLUTION, WHICH IMPLIES THAT DEMOCRATIC POLITICS MUST BE CONCEIVED OF AS A PERMANENT STRUGGLE AGAINST STRONG INSTITUTIONALISM BY THE POLITICAL SUBJECTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. HERE A PERMANENT AND RADICAL POLITICIZATION OF THE INFORMAL PUBLIC SPHERES AND SUBJECTS IS REQUIRED.
139	ESTABLISHED LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE GLOBE FACE WAVES OF POPULISM AND THE DANGER OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. AS POPULIST PARTIES ASSUME GOVERNMENTAL POWERS, CIVIL SERVANTS ARE CONFRONTED WITH A FUNDAMENTAL DILEMMA: ARE THEY EXPECTED TO SERVE THEIR NEWLY DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRINCIPALS, EVEN WHEN THEY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THEIR ILLIBERAL IDEOLOGIES? OR ARE THEY EXPECTED AS SERVANTS OF THE STATE TO ACTIVELY RESIST THE BACKSLIDING OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND THE RULE OF LAW? AND, IS RESISTING POSSIBLE AT ALL WITHOUT RESORTING TO NON-DEMOCRATIC MEANS? IN THIS WRITING, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THIS VEXING PROBLEM IN THE HEART OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC STATE AND MAKES A PLEA FOR STRENGTHENING THE DEMOCRATIC STATE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BUREAUCRACY.
140	BLOCKCHAIN IS A HIGHLY HYPED TECHNOLOGY, WITH MANY ANNOUNCED "USE CASES." WHAT HAPPENS, HOWEVER, AFTER THE "ANNOUNCEMENT"? HOW-IF AT ALL-ARE BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS FURTHER DEVELOPED? THIS ARTICLE DEPLOYS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS IN GOVERNMENT. IT FOCUSES ON THE MOMENT AFTER THE USE CASES ARE ANNOUNCED, BUT BEFORE THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH FACILITATES THE INVESTIGATION OF THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF RULE OF LAW VALUES, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, LEGITIMACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY. INSTEAD OF REPORTING ON USE CASES, WE CONDUCT CASE STUDIES TO ANALYZE THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS AFTER THE "ANNOUNCEMENT." STUDYING INNOVATION DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS IN GOVERNMENT.
141	THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS SOME OF THE COMMON ASSUMPTIONS FOUND IN POLITICAL HISTORIOGRAPHY REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS, SUCH AS DISTINCTIONS MADE BETWEEN IDEALISTS AND REALISTS, AND THE EXAGGERATED EMPHASIS PLACED ON THE CONCEPT OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY. THE MOST RELEVANT DRAFT CONSTITUTIONS FOR SUCH AN INTERNATIONAL ENTITY, CIRCULATED AMONG THE ANGLO-AMERICAN ELITES DURING WORLD WAR I, ARE ANALYZED WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON HOW THESE MEMORANDA WERE FRAMED WITHIN WHAT WERE CONSIDERED TO BE TWO OPPOSING PERSPECTIVES. WHILE THE LEGAL APPROACH ASSERTED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS CRUCIAL FOR GUARANTEEING PEACE, THE POLITICAL APPROACH SOUGHT TO SET UP A SYSTEM OF MUTUAL COMMITMENTS THAT WOULD EVOLVE FURTHER IN DUE COURSE.
142	THIS ARTICLE RECONSIDERS THE POLITICAL THOUGHT OF BONCOMPAGNO DA SIGNA IN THE LIGHT OF HIS OVERLOOKED PRAISE FOR THE HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR AND HIS EQUALLY OVERLOOKED CRITICISM OF THE CITY REPUBLICS. IT ARGUES THAT, RATHER THAN JUST SUPPORTING THE CITY REPUBLICS, HE ADDRESSED KINGSHIP, BACKING CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS CONTEXTUALIZED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE PEACE OF CONSTANCE, AND SIMILARITIES WITH THE VIEWS OF CONTEMPORARY JURISTS ARE EXAMINED, UNDERLINING NEGLECTED CONTRACTUAL ASPECTS IN THEIR THEORIES OF GOVERNMENT AND THE USE OF THE IUS ITALICUM TO JUSTIFY THE PREROGATIVES OF THE ITALIAN CITIES WITHIN THE EMPIRE. FINALLY, CONNECTIONS WITH THE SIXTH CANTO OF DANTE'S PURGATORY ARE EMPHASIZED.
143	THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES STUDIES ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF CAPITAL ACCOUNT LIBERALIZATION ON INDUSTRY GROWTH WHILE CONTROLLING FOR FINANCIAL CRISES, DOMESTIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE STRENGTH OF INSTITUTIONS. WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT FINANCIAL OPENNESS HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE GROWTH OF FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES, ALTHOUGH THESE GROWTH-ENHANCING EFFECTS EVAPORATE DURING FINANCIAL CRISES. FURTHER ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CAPITAL ACCOUNT LIBERALIZATION ARE LIMITED TO COUNTRIES WITH RELATIVELY WELL-DEVELOPED FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, GOOD ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, STRONG CREDITOR RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. IT SUGGESTS THAT COUNTRIES MUST REACH A CERTAIN THRESHOLD IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY CAN EXPECT TO BENEFIT FROM CAPITAL ACCOUNT LIBERALIZATION.

144	IN THIS PAPER, WE USE EVENT-STUDY METHODS TO ANALYZE THE POST-PRIVATIZATION REGULATORY REGIME APPLYING TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE UK. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TELECOMS REGULATION HAS NOT BEEN CAPTURED IN AN OVERALL SENSE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN HETEROGENEOUS PATTERN OF REGULATORY EVENTS. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT OBSERVATIONS OF SPILLER AND VOGELSANG, WHO ARGUE THAT THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR UK TELECOMS IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL CHECKS ON THE REGULATOR'S DISCRETION, OPERATING MAINLY THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW. OUR BROAD CONCLUSION IS THAT THE IMPACTS OF REGULATION INDICATE A RELATIVELY SOFT ATTITUDE TO BRITISH TELECOM UP TO 1995, WHEN A TIGHTENING OF REGULATION TENDED TO OFFSET THE PREVIOUS BIAS.
145	THE PREVAILING DEFINITIONS OF ORGANIZED CRIME AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO STUDYING IT DERIVE MAINLY FROM THE GLOBAL NORTH. HOWEVER, AN EMERGENT BODY OF LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH DIFFERS FROM ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE GLOBAL NORTH. FOCUSING ON THE CASE OF MEXICO, I ARGUE THAT MAINSTREAM CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORIES' INABILITY TO EXPLAIN SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN THAT COUNTRY STEMS FROM THEIR UNDERSPECIFIED SCOPE. MAINSTREAM THEORIES ANALYSE ORGANIZED CRIME AS A PHENOMENON THAT TRANSPIRES IN SOCIETIES CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH LEVELS OF INTERNAL PEACE, RULE OF LAW AND STRONG PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. IN MEXICO, A COUNTRY THAT FAILS TO ADHERE TO THESE CONDITIONS, ORGANIZED CRIME MANIFESTATIONS DEFY PREVAILING THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS.
146	HOW IS EU DEMOCRACY PROMOTION MADE COMPATIBLE WITH EUROPEAN COLONIAL POWERS' RECENT HISTORY OF QUASHING DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS? A DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF GENERAL PROGRAMMATIC EU STATEMENTS AND TEXTS RELATED TO SELECTED SALIENT HISTORIC JUNCTURES - THE ALGERIAN HIRAK, THE 2018 DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO ELECTIONS AND THE ARAB UPRISINGS - REVEALS THAT EU POLICY-MAKERS RECONCILE THE COLONIAL PAST AND THE DEMOCRACY-PROMOTING PRESENT MOSTLY THROUGH A SILENCING OF COLONIALISM. THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT COLONIAL-TIME HIERARCHICAL DISCOURSES ARE LEFT UNDISTURBED. MOREOVER, THE PROJECTION OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES NOT ONLY THE OFT-NOTED BREAK WITH THE PAST, BUT ALSO A CONTINUITY WITH COLONIAL DISCOURSES OF EUROPEANS AS 'DEMOCRATIC', 'HUMANITARIAN' AND 'CIVILISED'.
147	THE PRINCIPLE OF OPEN JUSTICE IS A CONSTITUENT ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW: IT DEMANDS PUBLICITY OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THE PUBLICATION OF JUDGMENTS. SINCE 2017, THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS SYSTEMATICALLY PUBLISHED FIRST INSTANCE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL DECISIONS IN AN ONLINE REPOSITORY. WHILST A VERITABLE TREASURE TROVE FOR RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS, THE DATABASE ALSO HAS DARKER POTENTIAL - FROM AUTOMATING BLACKLISTING TO CREATING NEW AND SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE. OUR SCRUTINY OF EXISTING LEGAL SAFEGUARDS, FROM ANONYMITY ORDERS TO EQUALITY LAW AND DATA PROTECTION, FINDS A NUMBER OF GAPS, WHICH THREATEN TO MAKE THE PRINCIPLE OF OPEN JUSTICE AS EMBODIED IN THE CURRENT PUBLICATION REGIME INIMICAL TO EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
148	THIS ARTICLE SITUATES THE EXPERIENCES OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IN POST-2000 ZIMBABWE IN A HISTORICAL SEQUENCE OF IMPRISONMENT. IT USES PRISONERS' NARRATIVES TO EXAMINE THE SHIFTING POLITICAL IDEAS AND SOCIAL AND MATERIAL PRACTICES THAT SHAPED OPPOSITION POLITICS. I EXPLORE THE CENTRALITY OF IDEAS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRACTICES AND BELIEFS THROUGH WHICH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONNECTION AND COMMUNITY WERE BUILT WITHIN AND BEYOND THE PRISON WALLS, AND THE TERRIBLE AND OFTEN ENDURING COSTS OF IMPRISONMENT. ALTHOUGH PRISONERS' NARRATIVES WERE OFTEN MARKED BY TALES OF IRREDEEMABLE LOSS, THEY ALSO UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE TO OPPOSITION POLITICAL IMAGINARIES OF BONDS BUILT ACROSS THE BARRIERS OF RACE, CLASS AND RESPECTABILITY AND CLAIMS TO A RIGHTS-BEARING CITIZENSHIP.
149	WE COMPUTE PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE (PSP) AND PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY (PSE) INDICATORS, COMPRISING A COMPOSITE AND SEVEN SUB-INDICATORS, FOR 23 INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES. THE FIRST FOUR SUB-INDICATORS ARE "OPPORTUNITY" INDICATORS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATIVE, EDUCATION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW AND A LEVEL PLAYING-FIELD IN A MARKET ECONOMY. THREE OTHER INDICATORS REFLECT THE STANDARD "MUSGRAVIAN" TASKS FOR GOVERNMENT: ALLOCATION, DISTRIBUTION AND STABILISATION. THE INPUT AND OUTPUT EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC SECTORS ACROSS COUNTRIES IS THEN MEASURED VIA A NON-PARAMETRIC PRODUCTION FRONTIER TECHNIQUE. THE STUDY FINDS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PSP AND PSE, WHICH SUGGESTS A LARGE POTENTIAL FOR EXPENDITURE SAVINGS IN MANY COUNTRIES.
150	THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE GOOD GOVERNANCE (GG) AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN IRANIAN SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS. THE SAMPLE WAS COMPOSED OF 150 SPORT MANAGERS FROM IRAN. THE INSTRUMENT USED WAS AN AD HOC QUESTIONNAIRE BASED ON THE BASIC UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES OF GG OF THE OLYMPIC AND SPORTS MOVEMENT. THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE CONFIRMED. AFTER DATA COLLECTION, THE DATA WERE ANALYZED WITH IBM SPSS AMOS 23, USING DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICAL METHODS. ACCORDING TO THE IRANIAN SPORTS MANAGERS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS OF GG AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN IRANIAN SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS WERE, IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: INTERNAL INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCY, TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIBILITY, DISCIPLINE, ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, PARTICIPATION AND DEMOCRACY.
151	FOR BOTH IDEALISTS AND PRAGMATISTS, THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS LEFT WHEN IT COMES TO DEFINING THE WAY FORWARD IN THE EU-TURKEY RELATIONSHIP. STRATEGIC, ECONOMIC, AND PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE RELATIONS ARE, HOWEVER, TOO IMPORTANT TO IGNORE. AT THE SAME TIME, KEEPING TURKEY ALIGNED WITH DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND WESTERN PARTNERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SHOULD BE A PRIORITY THESE CHALLENGES AND THE NEED TO SHAPE THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP IN AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ACCESSION WILL REQUIRE COMPROMISE FROM BOTH SIDES. ONE THING IS CERTAIN: A FOCUS ON SHARED INTERESTS IN THE AREAS OF TRADE, FOREIGN POLICY, AND PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS SHOULD NEVER LEAD TO DROPPING CONDITIONALITY WHEN IT COMES TO RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
152	THE CURRENT PROCESS OF DESIGNING A SET OF POST-2015 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THE UNDERLYING IDEA OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AT ITS CORE IS ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY, DEFINED AS THE INTEGRITY OF EARTH'S LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEMS, OR ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY IN SHORT. THIS DEFINITION IS REFLECTIVE OF THE SCIENCE AND ETHICS OF PLANETARY BOUNDARIES THAT ARE REFERRED TO IN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS, AND CAN BE FORMULATED AS A PRIORITY GOAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SDGS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES FOR DEVELOPING ECOLOGICAL INTEGRITY AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OR GRUNDNORM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE GRUNDNORM CHARACTER THAT HUMAN RIGHTS OR THE RULE OF LAW HAVE IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.
153	THE INCREASING SALIENCE OF SECURITY CONCERNS AFTER DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD HAS PUT SCHOLARS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF POLICE CORRUPTION AS A KEY ISSUE IMPEDING THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. USING DATA TAKEN FROM SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN MEXICO, PERU, AND BOLIVIA, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO SUCH LITERATURE BY QUESTIONING WHETHER CASES OF POLICE CORRUPTION HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE TRUST IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE RESEARCH FINDS THAT CITIZENS CAN SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER EVEN IF THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED BRIBERY. THE ARTICLE UNVEILS, HOWEVER, THAT ANOTHER TYPE OF POLICE CORRUPTION-POLICE PROTECTING CRIMINALS-IS A ROBUST AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT THEORY OF VARIANCE IN THE CONFIDENCE IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.
154	DEPORTATION IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND IMPLIES ENFORCEMENT BY THE STATE. THEREFORE, DOES THE REJECTION OF DEPORTATIONS CHALLENGE THE NATION STATE? THIS ARTICLE IS THE RESULT OF A QUALITATIVE STUDY THAT ANALYSES ARGUMENTATIONS OF ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE DEPORTATION PROCESS. THE CONTRIBUTION DISCUSSES TO WHAT EXTENT ARGUMENTATIONS FOR AND AGAINST DEPORTATIONS REFER TO EXISTING NORMATIVE GUIDELINES OF SOCIAL ORDER. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ARGUMENTS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST DEPORTATIONS ARE STRONGLY RELYING UPON THE NATION STATE. THE ACTORS REFER TO ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, INTEGRATION, ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM, DELINQUENCY, HUMANITARIANISM AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ONLY IDENTIFIABLE EXCEPTION IN THE REJECTION OF DEPORTATIONS BASED ON THE CLAIM FOR A HUMAN RIGHT TO MIGRATION.
155	A REVIEW OF LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE. FROM THE VIETNAM WAR ERA TO THE GULF WAR, DEMONSTRATES A JUDICIAL UNWILLINGNESS TO CONSTRAIN PRESIDENTIAL POLICYMAKING. IN MOST OF THESE CASES, THE JUDICIARY HAS RULED THE LEGAL CHALLENGE NONJUSTICIABLE, IN THE FIRST POST-COLD WAR CHALLENGE, DELLUMS V. BUSH, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ISSUED THE EQUIVALENT OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. ARGUABLY, THIS IS THE ONLY PRACTICAL JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL USE OF FORCE, BUT IT DOES LITTLE MORE THAN REDIRECT THE POLICY CONFLICT FROM THE COURTS TO CONGRESS. THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS A WEAK REED IN EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN PRESIDENTIAL POLICYMAKING ON THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE.
156	ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF WILDLIFE AND FOREST RESOURCES ARE PART OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIME, IN WHICH CAMEROON PLAYS A PART. A REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION, INTERVIEWS WITH KEY EXPERTS, AND COLLECTION OF FIELD DATA IN THE MARKETS AND PORTS OF THE CAMEROON'S THREE MAIN CITIES ENABLED THE GATHERING OF INFORMATION ON CONNECTIONS AND SYNERGIES BETWEEN THESE TWO CRIMINAL ACTS. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES A STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE AND ILLEGAL LOGGING IN CAMEROON. THESE TWO AREAS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY MAINTAIN SYNERGIES THROUGH BAD GOVERNANCE, WEAKENING OF RULE OF LAW, MAFIA CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS' ACTORS INVOLVED AND SHARING ACCESS ROUTES. BOTH RESULT IN NEGATIVE ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS.
157	THIS PAPER IS A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF A RECENT CASE DECIDED BY THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED AS PARADIGMATIC OF THE CURRENT APPROACH OF BRAZILIAN CASE LAW WITH REFERENCE TO CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. THE CASE REGARDS THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF A STATUTE PROVISION WHICH ALLOWED THE ENFORCEMENT OF PENALTIES PENDING A SECOND INSTANCE APPEAL AND THEREFORE BEFORE RES JUDICATA. THIS ANALYSIS AIMS AT DISCUSSING THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND LEGAL INTERPRETATION THEORY AS WELL AS THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS APPLIED IN THESE CASES. THE APPROACH ENDORSED BY THE COURT WILL BE ARGUED FROM BOTH A THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEW AND A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, IN ORDER TO OUTLINE ITS INADEQUACY AND CONFLICT WITH THE RULE OF LAW DOCTRINE.
158	THE RULE OF LAW PRESENTS A NEW PATH FOR UNDERSTANDING AND HANDLING RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA. THE FIELD OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IS NO EXCEPTION AND CURRENT LEGISLATION HAS TO BE IMPROVED SO THAT CHINA'S RELIGIOUS EDUCATION CAN BE FURTHER PROMOTED. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE LEGISLATION AND LEGISLATIVE REGULATIONS GOVERNING CHINA'S DIVERSIFIED AND DYNAMIC RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, WHICH INCLUDES PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS STUDIES, RELIGIOUS EDUCATION EMBEDDED IN ETHNIC EDUCATION, MISSIONARY RELIGIOUS EDUCATION, RELIGIOUS EDUCATION INCLUDED IN GENERAL EDUCATION, AND EDUCATION ON RELIGIOUS POLICIES AND REGULATIONS. IT ARGUES THAT HOW TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION STANDS OUT AS THE CORE ISSUE, AS CHINA REQUIRES A MORE DIALECTICAL AND PLURALISTIC RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.
159	ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ENGAGEMENT BEYOND ITS BORDERS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT POWER, THE CONCEPT REMAINS UNDER-UTILIZED IN EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY (ENP). THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE PROPOSES POLITICAL STEERING AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND TRACK THE EMPIRICAL USE AND ENTANGLEMENTS OF DIVERSE FORMS OF POWER, HIGHLIGHTING GENUINE SOFT MECHANISMS. THESE BIND ACTORS TO DISCURSIVE PRACTICES BECAUSE FORMALIZED SANCTIONS OR INSTITUTIONS ARE ABSENT. THIS CASE STUDY OF THE EU'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION IN MOROCCO REVEALS HOW SUCH SOFT MECHANISMS ARE INTERTWINED WITH INDIRECT STEERING MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE TECHNICALIZATION OF POLICY REFORM AT THE GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL AND PARALLEL POLITICIZATION AT THE SOCIETAL LEVEL.
160	CONTRARY TO THE MODERN ENGLISH POSITION, IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR REVIEWING COURTS TO ACCORD DEFERENCE TO INTERPRETATIONS OF LAW RENDERED BY ADMINISTRATORS. THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THE CURRENT STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST ACCORDING SUCH DEFERENCE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED TO DELEGATE THE RESOLUTION OF MANY QUESTIONS OF LAW TO ADMINISTRATORS, RATHER THAN TO COURTS. MOREOVER, RELATIVE TO ADMINISTRATORS, COURTS MAY LACK INSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCE TO RESOLVE QUESTIONS OF LAW. COURTS MUST ALWAYS POLICE THE BOUNDARIES OF INTERPRETATION, IN ORDER TO KEEP ADMINISTRATORS IN CHECK AND SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW, BUT THE GENERAL PRESUMPTION THAT THE RESOLUTION OF QUESTIONS OF LAW IS A MATTER FOR COURTS SHOULD BE JETTISONED.
161	THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE ROLES OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS IN EXPLAINING THE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP SHARE OF A COUNTRY'S BANKING ASSETS. IN PARTICULAR, OUR STUDY INCLUDES NEW MARKET-OPENNESS AND REGULATION VARIABLES. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE IN SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT AFFECTS FINANCIAL SECTOR REGULATION OF EVERY CURRENT AND POTENTIAL WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION MEMBER COUNTRY, AND OPENING FINANCIAL MARKETS IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF THIS AGREEMENT. WE FIND THAT THE MARKET OPENNESS INDEX DEVELOPED BY BARTH ET AL. (2010) BEARS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATION TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, AS EXPECTED, AND THAT REGULATION, RULE OF LAW, AND PROFIT OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF BANK ASSETS.
162	THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WAS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN POST-SOCIALIST HUNGARY TRANSITIONING TOWARDS A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, IN THE PAST DECADE ITS AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO RESTRICTIONS OF BOTH SYSTEMIC AND SPECIFIC NATURE. MANY OF THE LATTER TYPE OF RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE EU COURT OFJUSTICE, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF EU LAW INDICATING THE NECESSITY OF CORRECTING HUNGARIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND/OR JUDICIAL AND ADMIN-ISTRATIVE PRACTICE. HOWEVER, THE RULINGS FROM THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAVE MET RESTRICTIVE IMPLEMENTA-TION PRACTICES, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC REGRESSION IN JUDICIAL PROTECTION.
163	THIS ESSAY MAPS THE TRANSFORMATION OF SECURITY FROM A SYMBOL OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT UNDER THE COLD WAR PARADIGM OF NATIONAL SECURITY INTO A PUBLIC GOOD AND A POLICY FIELD ACKNOWLEDGED AS LEGITIMATE AND DEMOCRATIC BY POLITICIANS AND POLICY EXPERTS. USING PRESENT-DAY ARGENTINA AS AN EXAMPLE, WE SHOW HOW SECURITY IDEAS GAIN DOMINANCE ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, DISPLACING AND SUBORDINATING DEMOCRATIC POLITICS CONCEIVED IN TERMS OF RIGHTS. AS INSTITUTIONS INCREASINGLY ACCEPT SECURITY MEASURES AND PRE-EMPTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT, A SECURITISING DISCOURSE - DESPITE ITS CLAIMS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE 'CITIZEN' - TRUMPS GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. APPEALING TO CITIZENS' CONCERNS AND RIGHTS, THE NEW FORMS OF SECURITISATION MAY YET UNDERMINE DEMOCRATIC LIFE.
164	THIS ARTICLE BUILDS UPON TWO RELATED ISSUES. THE FIRST ISSUE CONSISTS IN THE UNPACKING OF CONSTITUTIONAL TIME AS A FUNDAMENTAL NOTION GUIDING EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. THE SECOND ISSUE CONCERNS THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUCCESSFULLY COMBINES RULE OF LAW - AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM - AND DEMOCRACY IN THE TRANSNATIONAL SPHERE. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS ADOPTING A FUTURE-ORIENTED APPROACH, WHICH IMPLIES TESTING A POLITY'S COMMITMENT THROUGH BOTH A PROCESS OF COLLECTIVE WILL-FORMATION AND DELIBERATION AND PRACTICES OF SELF-GOVERNMENT. A SHIFT FROM SELF-REFERENTIALITY TO HETERARCHY, WHICH WILL HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONAL SETTING, IS BOTH EXPOSED AND ADVOCATED.
165	RECENTLY, THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PROPOSED THE INCORPORATION OF A STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER (SRP) INTO COMMONWEALTH REVENUE LEGISLATION. THE PROPOSED SRP WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A QUASI-LEGISLATIVE POWER VESTED IN THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION TO ALTER OR AMEND REVENUE LAW IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE FOUNDATIONAL ISSUE OF WHETHER THE PREMISE UNDERLYING AN SRP IS CONSTITUTIONALLY VALID AND FURTHER CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD HAVE ON THE LEGISLATIVE DESIGN OF SUCH A MEASURE. THIS INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF HOW TO CHARACTERISE AN SRP FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PURPOSES, WHETHER AN SRP COMPLIES WITH S 55 OF THE COMMONWEALTH CONSTITUTION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR CONCEPTS SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
166	THIS PAPER ANALYZES WHY FORMATION OF POLICY NETWORKS, WHICH IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL OF EUROPEAN POLICY IN DIFFERENT SPHERES, HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT PART OF ITS POSITIVE FUNCTIONS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF GUARANTEEING EUROPEAN ENERGY SECURITY IN CASE OF EUROPEAN-RUSSIAN GAS POLICY NETWORKS. THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL REGIME IN GAS TRADE AS WELL AS BY FAILED TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, MARKET ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA. AS A RESULT OF THIS, GERMAN, ITALIAN AND FRENCH LEADERS INVOLVED INTO EUROPEAN-RUSSIAN GAS POLICY NETWORKS FACE SERIOUS MORAL, LEGAL AND POLITICAL DILEMMAS.

167	THE UNITED NATIONS ESTABLISHED A COUNTERTERRORISM MECHANISM IN THE FORM OF THE COUNTERTERRORISM COMMITTEE WHEN IT ADOPTED SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1373 (2001). THE COMMITTEE HAS SO FAR WORKED WITH REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL STATES IN CAPACITY BUILDING EFFORTS TO AUGMENT LOCAL COUNTERTERRORISM ABILITIES. HOWEVER, ETHICAL BOTTLENECKS REMAIN. THE PROBLEM OF ETHICS ARISES WHEN LAWS LACK LEGITIMACY REGARDING CRIMINALITY AND STATE POWER AND WHEN THEY DIVERGE FROM THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE KEENLY PLACED TO ENSURE THAT STATES ADOPT LEGITIMATE COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURES, THUS AVOIDING ETHICAL BOTTLENECKS. BY WORKING WITH STATES TO MAINTAIN THE MORAL HIGH GROUND, REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE OSCE CAN PREVENT UNNECESSARY COMPROMISES BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY.
168	THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CLARIFICATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LAW AND ECONOMICS FROM THE ASPECT OF LAW. BASED ON THE ABOVE AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RECODIFICATION OF SLOVAK CIVIL LAW AND HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT, AUTHOR OF THE STUDY EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PRIVATE LAW. THE RELATION OF LAW AND ECONOMICS IS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN SOCIETY. THERE WAS A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL RELATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF INTEREST OF THE EARLIER LEGISLATION. THIS RELATIONSHIP GETS NEW QUALITY UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF SLOVAK ECONOMY. AT PRESENT FUNCTIONING OF THE FREE MARKET RAISES THE QUESTION OF THE STATE'S ROLE IN THE ECONOMY, IN PARTICULAR THE LEGALITY AND THE LIMITS OF STATE INTERVENTION IN ECONOMIC RELATIONS.
169	THIS PAPER PRESENTS A SOLID NORMATIVE APPROACH IN MILITARY ETHICS, WHICH JUSTIFIES THE RULE OF LAW IN A CONSTITUTIONAL REGIME CAPABLE OF FIXING THE PROPER ROLE OF THE ARMED FORCES IN BRAZIL. DEPLOYING THIS ETHICAL FRAMEWORK, IT ANALYZES THE RELEVANT LITERATURE, ESPECIALLY AUTHORS WHO DEFEND CIVILIAN SUPREMACY FOR THE GOOD FUNCTIONING OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. AFTERWARDS, SOME MODELS OF CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS ARE INTRODUCED TO ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS AND INDICATORS OF PROPER DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. THESE PARAMETERS ARE APPLIED TO RECENT EVENTS, REVEALING THAT BRAZIL IS REGRESSING IN ITS CIVILIAN CONTROL OVER THE MILITARY. FINALLY, SOME PRACTICAL PROPOSALS FOR REVERSING THIS TENDENCY ARE PUT FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF A FULLY DEMOCRATIC REGIME IN BRAZIL.
170	THE EUROPEAN UNIFICATION PROJECT EMERGED DUE TO CONFRONTING THE FASCISM THAT DEVASTATED THE CONTINENT. HOWEVER, THIS STRUGGLE HAS NOT CEASED SINCE VARIOUS FASCIST CHARACTERISTICS HAVE SURVIVED IN A SERIES OF OPENLY NEO-FASCIST MOVEMENTS AND POLITICAL PARTIES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT. WITHOUT THE EXPLICIT VIOLENCE OF FASCISM AND NEO-FASCISM, THESE PARLIAMENTARY POST-FASCISMS STILL RETAIN THE FORMS OF EXCLUSION OF HISTORICAL FASCISM AND CHARACTERISTICS CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IS BASED ON A SERIES OF MEASURES THAT SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC MEMORY. FOLLOWING A CONTENT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY, WE WILL PURSUE THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY: TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENT FORMS THAT FASCISM HAS TAKEN IN EUROPE.
171	THIS ESSAY IS BASED ON RECENT HISTORIO-GRAPHICAL DISCOVERIES AND ON THE MATERIAL RESEARCH OF THE AUTHORS AND INVESTIGATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TENDENCY OF THE 1970S: THAT OF THE IMAGINATION OF PROJECTS OF PROSPECTING OF DEMOCRACY FROM THE DICTATORSHIP THROUGH 'POLITICAL TRANSITION' AGENDAS. THE FOCUS OF THE ANALYSIS IS TWOFOLD BUT RELATED: ON THE ONE HAND, WE DEAL WITH THE INTERVENTION OF KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLECTUAL PRACTICES OF SUCH PROJECTS BETWEEN THEMES SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, SOCIAL ISSUES AND THE RULE OF LAW; ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DISCUSS THE RENEWAL IN THE 1970S OF THE US COLD WAR STRATEGIES, WHICH PROVIDE THE VECTORS OF SCHEDULING AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION, DECISIVE IN THE CONSTITUTION OF 'DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION' MODELS.
172	THE AUTHOR TAKES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW TWO COMPELLING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (PA) TO EXPOSE HOW EITHER WOULD NOT OSTENSIBLY IDENTIFY WITH THE SCHOLARLY FIELD OF PA ITSELF. BOTH OF THE WORKS ADVANCE THEIR THESES THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF DISCIPLINES, THOUGH LESS THAN A SELF-IDENTIFYING "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION" SCHOLAR MIGHT LIKE. NONETHELESS, THEY DO SO BETTER THAN PA SCHOLARSHIP HAS DONE BEYOND ITS OWN LIMITED READERSHIP. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT PATHOLOGIES OF MANAGERIAL AND POLITICAL SILOS THAT LARGELY IGNORE "RULE OF LAW" AS A PILLAR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE MAKE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-AS AN ACADEMIC ENTERPRISE-LARGELY SILENT (OR INCAPABLE) IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CRITICAL ISSUES OF GOVERNMENTAL LEGITIMACY AND CRISIS.
173	FREEDOM AS A NATURAL RIGHT, THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSENT, DEFENDING THE IDEA THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF THE MOST VIRTUOUS AND REFLECTIVE CITIZENS, DENOUNCING PATRONAGE, THE NEED TO LINK INDIVIDUAL AND POLITICAL FREEDOM ... THESE ARE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF LA BOETIE'S DOCTRINE THAT I BELIEVE PLACE HIM WITHIN THE TRADITION THAT QUENTIN SKINNER CALLS THE NEO-ROMAN CONCEPTION OF CIVIL LIBERTY. OF COURSE, LA BOETIE DID NOT WRITE A POSITIVE DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS LIVY DID IN HIS HISTORY OF ROME AND AS THE ENGLISH REPUBLICANS DO, BUT THE DISCOURSE CAN EASILY BE READ AS A LEGAL PLEA CONDEMNING ABSOLUTE MONARCHY AND ANY KIND OF ARBITRARY REGIME.
174	IN HYBRID PEACE GOVERNANCE, LIBERAL AND ILLIBERAL NORMS, INSTITUTIONS, AND ACTORS EXIST ALONGSIDE EACH OTHER, INTERACT, AND EVEN CLASH. SUCH A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL ORDER IS A FAR CRY FROM THE LIBERAL IDEA OF PEACE BASED ON LEGITIMATE AND ACCOUNTABLE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, FREE MEDIA, MARKET ECONOMY, AND AN OPEN CIVIL SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE EMERGENCE OF HYBRID PEACE GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPS A TYPOLOGY BASED ON THE WAR/PEACE AND LIBERAL/ILLIBERAL SPECTRA. FURTHERMORE, IT DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF HYBRIDITY AND, IN PARTICULAR, WHETHER IT CAN AVOID THE PITFALLS OF TOP-DOWN LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING AND PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE, LOCALLY ENGRAINED VERSION OF PEACE.
175	AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS STATEMENT WAS SUBMITTED TO RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW: HEARING BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 110TH CONGRESS (SEPT. 16, 2008). THE VERSION OF THE STATEMENT PUBLISHED HERE WAS PROVIDED TO MEMBERS OF BARACK OBAMA'S TRANSITION TEAM IN DECEMBER 2008. IT SUGGESTS NUMEROUS POLICY CHANGES,FOR THE NEW PRESIDENT. IN PARTICULAR, THE SIGNATORIES TO THIS STATEMENT CALL FOR THE CLOSE OF GUANTANAMO AND SECRET PRISONS, THE REJECTION OF SPECIALIZED TERROR COURTS, A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY WITH REGARD TO TORTURE AND AN END TO EXTRAORDINARY RENDITION. AT THE TIME OF THIS PUBLICATION, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEGUN TO TAKE IMPORTANT STEPS TO REALIZE SOME OF THESE GOALS.
176	THIS ARTICLE WILL ADDRESS THE SUBJECT OF CLASS ACTION AND THE HATE SPEECHES, AIMING SPECIFICALLY TO CHECK WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLASS ACTIONS IN THE SCOPE OF TUTELAGE OF THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. THE METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURE APPLIED TO RESEARCH WILL BE THEORETICAL, USING THE METHOD OF CONTENT ANALYSIS, WHICH WILL BE EVALUATED MEDIA MESSAGES, EXAMINATION PAPERS, STUDY OF LEGISLATION AND JURISPRUDENCE. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH IT WAS FOUND THAT CLASS ACTIONS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROTECTION OF POLITICAL MINORITIES FROM SO-CALLED HATE SPEECHES. A FACT THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AIDS IN GUARANTEEING TO THE RULE OF LAW TRULY DEMOCRATIC.
177	IN LATIN AMERICA, COMMUNITY POLICING PROGRAMMES HAVE INCREASED DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THE PROGRAMMES WERE EXPECTED TO REDUCE CRIME AND STRENGTHEN COLLABORATIVE RELATIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND POPULATION, AMONG OTHERS. HOWEVER, AN EXCESSIVE FOCUS ON TECHNICAL ASPECTS HAS NEGLECTED COUNTERPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON A HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM APPROACH, THIS PAPER CRITICALLY ANALYSES THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY POLICING AND ARGUES THAT WIDER SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXTS AND INSTITUTIONAL PATTERNS OF SELF-DEFENCE POLICING DETERMINE THE OUTCOMES OF COMMUNITY POLICING PROGRAMMES. BY EXAMINING THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT COMMUNITY POLICING HAS CONTRIBUTED TO REINFORCE ANTIDEMOCRATIC PATTERNS THROUGH THE REPRODUCTION OF SELF-DEFENCE MECHANISMS CREATED DURING THE YEARS OF INTERNAL CONFLICT.
178	OVER THE YEARS, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW HAVE TAKEN THEIR RESPECTIVE PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT WITH EACH REGULATING DISTINCT AREAS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS. INTERESTINGLY, HOWEVER, A NEW TREND SEEMS TO EMERGE IN WHICH THE TWO LEGAL NORMS INTERACT AND/OR CONVERGE. THIS 'INTERACTION' OR 'CONVERGENCE' IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD. ON THE ONE HAND, EACH NORM COULD COMPLEMENT THE OTHER, SO AS TO ENHANCE THE NOTION OF RULE OF LAW IN THE RESPECTIVE AREAS. ON THE OTHER HAND, NEW PROBLEMS SUCH AS MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FORUM SHOPPING LA POSE ANOTHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITIES. ADJUSTING THIS CONVERGENCE TOWARD A RIGHT DIRECTION WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE FUTURE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW.
179	OUR PROFESSION IS BASED ON ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, WHICH EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS FESTSCHRIFT FOR HIRAM C. POLK, THE ETHICAL FORCES THAT SHAPE A CAREER IN SURGERY-INCLUDING THEIR IMPACT ON THE TIMELY ISSUE OF MEDICAL ERRORS, TRUTH-TELLING, AND DISCLOSURE-ARE DISCUSSED. THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS (AS ADDRESSED BY KANT AND ARISTOTLE, AMONG OTHERS) THAT MAY GUIDE THE SURGEON ARE CONSIDERED AND DISCUSSED WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE PRACTICE OF SURGERY. THE ROLES THAT COURAGE, SELF-EVALUATION, AND TEACHING PLAY IN OUR PRACTICES ARE REVIEWED AS ARE NEW INITIATIVES FOR IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR OUR PATIENTS-OUR ULTIMATE PROFESSIONAL GOAL.

180	WE EXPLORE WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM AUTHORITARIAN BACKSLIDING IN MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES ABOUT THE THREATS TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY POSED BY THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. WE DEVELOP SOME CAUSAL HUNCHES AND AN EMPIRICAL BASELINE BY CONSIDERING THE RISE OF ELECTED AUTOCRATS IN VENEZUELA, TURKEY, AND HUNGARY. ALTHOUGH AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS MAY FORESTALL A REVERSION TO ELECTORAL AUTOCRACY, WE SEE SOME STRIKING PARALLELS IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATIC DYSFUNCTION, POLARIZATION, THE NATURE OF AUTOCRATIC APPEALS, AND THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH AUTOCRATIC INCUMBENTS SOUGHT TO EXPLOIT ELECTED OFFICE. THESE PROCESSES COULD GENERATE A DIMINISHED DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IN WHICH ELECTORAL COMPETITION SURVIVES, BUT WITHIN A POLITICAL SPACE THAT IS NARROWED BY WEAKENED HORIZONTAL CHECKS ON EXECUTIVE POWER AND RULE OF LAW.
181	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE WORK OF A LEADING SPANISH LEGAL PHILOSOPHER, FRANCISCO LAPORTA, AND HIS APPROACH TO THE CONCEPT OF LAW. LAW, IN HIS VIEW, IS TO BE REFERRED TO A FORMALIST NOTION OF RULE: IT IS THE RULE OF LAW, AS A FORMAL REQUIREMENT, THAT WOULD DEFINE THE NATURE OF LAW. IN SHORT, HIS THEORY MAY BE QUALIFIED AS LEGALISTIC. LAPORTA'S ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF LEGALISM ARE HERE TESTED AND CRITICIZED. IN A CODA TO THAT DISCUSSION, LAPORTA'S APPROACH IS BROUGHT INTO RELATION WITH THE LEGAL ETHICS PROPOSED BY A CLOSE FRIEND OF HIS, LIBORIO HIERRO, WHO FROM LEGALISM DERIVES SUBSTANTIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR LAWYERS' ETHICS. THESE LEGAL ETHICS ARE ALSO BROUGHT UNDER SCRUTINY AND CHALLENGED.
182	IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE TRUE JESUS CHURCH, A COMPLETELY INDIGENOUS PENTECOSTAL CHINESE RELIGIOUS GROUP THAT HAS EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS, REVEALS THE COMPLEX AND DIVERSE REALITY OF VARIATION IN CHURCH-STATE RELATIONSHIPS IN CHINA. THE TRUE JESUS CHURCH IS DISTINCT IN THAT, IN MANY REGIONS, IT IS NOT A PART OF THE OVERALL THREE-SELF PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT STRUCTURE, NOR DOES IT BELONG TO THE HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENT. IN CHINA TODAY, A SOCIETY WHERE AN OVERARCHING RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEM IS MISSING, FATES OF RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS OFTEN LIE IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL BUREAUCRATS. THE QUALITY OF RELATIONSHIPSTHE GUANXI WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFTEN DETERMINES THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM FOR RELIGIOUS PRACTICES.
183	THIS PAPER ADDS TO THE GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT EXPLORES WHICH FORCE, MILITARY OR CIVILIAN POLICE, WOULD BE THE MORE EFFECTIVE IN FILLING THE SECURITY GAP IN A POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT. THE CURRENT DEBATE CENTRES ON SPECIALISED UNITS WITHIN THE MILITARY OR PARAMILITARY CONSTABULARY FORCES SUCH AS THE GENDARMERIE OR THE CARABINIERI AS BEING MORE APPROPRIATE THAN CIVILIAN POLICE IN FILLING THE SECURITY GAP. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE IDEA THAT CIVILIAN POLICE WITH THE CORRECT TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT ARE AS COMPETENT AS ANY OTHER FORCE IN PROVIDING IMMEDIATE POST-CONFLICT SECURITY AND ARE IN FACT SUPERIOR TO MILITARY FORCES IN ESTABLISHING A SENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN A WAR TORN NATION.
184	1958: A PRIORI REVIEW OF PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION TO KEEP PARLIAMENT WITHIN ITS LIMITED LEGISLATIVE COMPETENCES - 2008: A POSTERIORI REVIEW TO PROTECT CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - VARIETIES OF CONCRETE REVIEW - ORIGINALITY OF THE NEW FRENCH PROCEDURE - AN INDIRECT CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINT: RAISED BY A LITIGATING PARTY, TRANSMITTED BY AN ORDINARY COURT AND DECIDED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL - OBSTACLE TO TRANSMISSION: DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY IN THE MOTIVES OF AN EARLIER DECISION BY CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL - CONCEPTUAL, LOGICAL AND LEGAL REASONS FOR A STRICT DISTINCTION BETWEEN NORMATIVE CONTENT AND JUSTIFICATORY DISCOURSE IN JUDGMENTS - SETTING ON PAR OF MOTIVES AND OPERATIVE PART TRANSFORMS FRENCH LEGAL SYSTEM INTO A SPECIFIC FORM OF COMMON LAW AND WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW
185	THESE RESEARCH NOTES EXPLORE THE IDEA OF COMPARING EXECUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (US) TO EXECUTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA (ISIS). IS IT POSSIBLE THAT AMERICA'S OSTENSIBLY RATIONAL, FORMAL, AND "CLINICAL" DEATH PENALTY IS MORE PAINFUL FOR ITS VICTIMS THAN ISIS VICTIMS? I INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION BY CONSIDERING THE SUFFERING CAUSED BY THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE US, MAKING SOME INFORMED SPECULATIONS ABOUT ISIS EXECUTIONS, DISCUSSING EXECUTION IN TWO INFLUENTIAL ISLAMIC NATIONS, AND OBSERVING SOME IRONIES THESE TOPIC RAISE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. MY GOAL WITH THESE NOTES IS TO SPUR INTEREST IN COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON STATE VIOLENCE AND THE DEATH PENALTY.
186	THE JURISDICTIONAL ROUTE PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTING ITSELF AS A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR IN MODERN DEMOCRACIES. DESPITE THIS, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS, THE JUDICIALIZATION OF CONFLICTS DOES NOT ENTAIL AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE. ALTERNATIVE CONFLICT METHODS ARE PRESENTED AS MORE FLEXIBLE MODELS, CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR SIMPLICITY, PROMPTNESS AND SEARCH FOR UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES RATHER THAN CONFRONTATION. COOPERATIVE LAW IS THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE APPLICATION OF THESE MECHANISMS. NICARAGUA HAS NOT BEEN ALIEN TO THESE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION FIGURES IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER, ONLY CORRECT REGULATION COUPLED WITH PROFUSE INFORMATION AND TRAINING FOR ALL OPERATORS WILL BE THE KEY TO A REAL AND EFFECTIVE APPLICATION.
187	DUE TO THE COURSE OF EUROPEAN HISTORY, GERMAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ARE NOT EXACTLY RENOWNED ABROAD FOR EPITOMIZING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, TRIES TO LEAVE THE CHAMBER OF HORRORS CALLED MEMORIES BEHIND AND DISCUSSES THE QUESTION OF HOW INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS IN GERMANY TODAY. THIS WILL MAINLY BE DISCUSSED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A LEGAL SCHOLAR. THE ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK ALLOWS FOR EFFICIENT OVERSIGHT OF THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES. WHERE OVERSIGHT DEFICITS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, RECENT REFORM PROPOSALS RELATED TO THEM WILL BE DISCUSSED CRITICALLY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES, NOT ALL PROPOSALS FOR REFORM ARE SUITABLE FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS AT HAND.
188	THREATS TO ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY ('ECO-THREATS') FACE NOT ONLY SHORTCOMINGS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DURING HOSTILITIES UNDER THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT. CONSIDERING THE NEW 'HYBRID THREAT' CONCEPT, WHICH HAD RECENTLY BEEN DISCUSSED BY NATO, THE AUTHORS RECOGNISE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THE NEED FOR ADOPTING A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL APPROACH TOWARDS SUCH THREATS. THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND THE CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW SHOW SOME SHORTCOMINGS TO TACKLE THE NEW CHALLENGE. IN THE FOCUS IS THE RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY, WHICH CAN PLAY A ROLE WHEN COUNTERING SUCH THREATS AND LEGAL RULES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO ACT.
189	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE PUBLICATIONS RELATING TO DIFFERENT DRAFT CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH WERE THE SUBJECT OF PARLIAMENTARY WORK IN 1993-1997. THEY COULD BE USEFUL TO BOTH PARLIAMENT AND ALL CITIZENS, SINCE THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION HAD TO BE APPROVED IN A REFERENDUM. PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THOSE ARTICLES WHICH ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE STRUCTURE OF PARLIAMENT. MANY OF THE PRESENTED ARTICLES HAVE A GENERAL NATURE, DISCUSSING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES APPLIED IN DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, RULE OF LAW). THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THOSE ARTICLES ARE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
190	THE AFRICAN FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) RULE OF LAW MOVEMENT IS FAR FROM INCIDENTAL. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF PARTICULAR CRIMES AS OF GRAVEST CONCERN TO HUMANITY, CRIMES WHICH, WHEN VIEWED IN POLITICAL TERMS, FOSTER COOPERATION BY THE MAJORITY OF STATE PARTIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WORKINGS OF A GLOBAL ELITE OF LIBERALIST LAWYERS AND POLICY MAKERS ENGAGED IN ESTABLISHING WHAT PARTICULAR TYPES OF VIOLENCE ARE CONSIDERED PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL MORAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA. I ARGUE THE ICC'S EMPHASIS ON "COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY," CONCEPTIONS OF "JUSTICE," AND HUMAN RIGHTS OVERLOOKS COLONIAL HISTORY AND ITS CONTINUING POSTCOLONIAL EFFECTS AND THE GEO-POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF RESOURCE COMPETITION.
191	THIS STUDY UTILISES EIGHT ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONS AND THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE METHOD TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON POVERTY. THE ESTIMATES SHOW THAT AN ECONOMY WITH A ROBUST SYSTEM TO CONTROL CORRUPTION, AN EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT, AND A STABLE POLITICAL SYSTEM WILL CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH, MINIMISE INCOME DISTRIBUTION CONFLICTS, AND REDUCE POVERTY. CORRUPTION, INEFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTS, AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY WILL NOT ONLY HURT INCOME LEVELS THROUGH MARKET INEFFICIENCIES, BUT ALSO ESCALATE POVERTY INCIDENCE VIA INCREASED INCOME INEQUALITY. THE RESULTS ALSO IMPLY THAT THE QUALITY OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM, RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND EXPROPRIATION RISK ARE INVERSELY RELATED TO POVERTY BUT THEIR EFFECT ON POVERTY IS VIA AVERAGE INCOME RATHER THAN INCOME DISTRIBUTION.
192	IN CHINA, 'RESIDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE AT A DESIGNATED RESIDENCE,' AS PROVIDED BY ITS CURRENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW, IS A SPECIAL FORM OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION DESIGNED ALLEGEDLY AS A NON-CUSTODIAL MEASURE TO REDUCE THE RATE OF PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY. HOWEVER, LEGAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING THIS MEASURE TACITLY ALLOW SUSPECTS TO BE HELD INCOMMUNICADO FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS WITHOUT ACCESS TO RELATIVES AND LAWYERS. THE MEASURE IS ALSO HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC IN LEGAL PRACTICE, BECAUSE IT OFTEN ACTS AS A CONVENIENT TOOL FOR BYPASSING REGULAR LEGAL SAFEGUARDS. 'RESIDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE AT A DESIGNATED RESIDENCE' IS VERY SIMILAR TO TWO OTHER MEASURES-'SHUANGGUI' AND 'LIUZHI'-WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THE REPRESSIVE DETENTION MEASURE STAINS CHINA'S STRUGGLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
193	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO BRING A REFLECTION ON THE POSITION OF THE JUDGE AS AUTHOR OF A TEXT, THE LEGAL DECISION. THIS POSITION LIMITS HIS FREEDOM TO SAY, IN THE DECISION, WHAT HE WANTS, BEFORE THE COMMITMENT THAT MUST KEEP WITH THE RULE OF LAW; DISCUSSES THESE IMPLICATIONS FROM THE PLACES OF LEGALITY AND LITERALITY IN POSITIVE LAW DERIVED FROM KELSENIAN NORMATIVITY IN CONTRAST TO SCHMITTIAN DECISIONISM, EMPHASIZING THE DECISION-MAKING ELEMENT OF EVERY DECISION; APPROACHES THE PROBLEM OF LEGAL DECISION AS POTENTIALLY ARBITRARY AND RHETORIC AS THE SUPPORT OF A BELIEF ABOUT LITERALITY, EVEN IN THE FACE OF DECISIONS THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS CONTRA LEGEM, USING THE EQUITY ARGUMENT AS THE BASIS.
194	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE DEBATE SURROUNDING INTRA-EUROPEAN UNION (EU) INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION AND THE INTERVENTION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN AN INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION AGAINST ROMANIA. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS DEMONSTRATED GREAT APPETITE TO PURSUE ITS OWN AGENDA IN MULTIPLE PROCEEDINGS GENERATING AN OUTCOME WHICH, IT IS ARGUED, IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN ROMANIA AND SEVERAL OTHER MEMBER STATES. THE ARTICLE WARNS THAT IF THE COMMISSION IS NOT PREPARED TO COUNTENANCE THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW OBLIGATIONS CAN PREVAIL OVER EU LAW (AT LEAST IN SO FAR AS IT IS INTERPRETED BY THE COMMISSION) A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT MAY BE SET AND THERE COULD BE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
195	PROSTITUTION, IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE OF RULE OF LAW, EMBODY A SET OF CONTROVERSIAL AND DISCRIMINATORY SOCIAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENT ALL ALONG THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AFTER THE AMBIVALENCE IN THE MATTER OF SOCIAL PROTECTION IN THE REGULATION OR REGIMENTATION OF THIS SOCIAL REALITY, THE RULING T-629 OF 2010 OFFERS A FRAMEWORK OF DISCUSSION, ESPECIALLY ON HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, THE RIGHT TO WORK AND A LEGITIMATE SYSTEM OF BENEFITS. NOWADAYS, THE BILL 079 OF 2013 IS BEING CARRIED OUT, WHICH TRIES TO COMPLY THE WRITS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITH THE PURPOSE TO GUARANTEE THE DIGNITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE PROSTITUTION BY THEIR OWN WILL.
196	IN UKRAINE, THERE EXISTS AN UNSTABLE PLURALISM. SINCE 1992, THE COMPETING ELITES HAVE FAILED EITHER TO SECURE AN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM, OR TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS LIES WITH THE DYSFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS, A WEAK SOCIETY, AND THE FRAGMENTATION OF ELITES. THE LAST ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY, WHICH FOLLOWED THE ORANGE REVOLUTION, FAILED BECAUSE THE ELITES MISSED THEIR CHANCE TO CREATE NEW STRUCTURES OF POWER AND DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES. BUT THE GREAT SERVICE OF THE "ORANGE REVOLUTIONARIES" REMAINS THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTACT BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE ELITES - IN A WAY NOT UNLIKE COMMUNICATING TUBES. THE RESULTS OF THE EARLY ELECTION PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANOTHER RUN AT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND RULE OF LAW.
197	FEDERAL INMATES IN CANADA CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF MECHANISMS THAT PURPORT TO ENSURE THEIR RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED: INTERNAL GRIEVANCE SYSTEMS, THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, THE OFFICE OF THE CORRECTIONAL INVESTIGATOR, THE COURT SYSTEM, AND MORE. HOWEVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, EACH OF THESE MECHANISMS IS INADEQUATE TO IMPORT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM. INSTEAD, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE CREATION OF A FEDERAL INMATE GRIEVANCE TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON THE MERITS OF SELECTED GRIEVANCES. KEY FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED TRIBUNAL INCLUDE FAIRNESS AND INDEPENDENCE; TIMELY RESOLUTION OF CASES; AND THE ABILITY TO ISSUE BINDING ORDERS. IN ADDITION, THE STRUCTURE OF THE PROPOSED TRIBUNAL IS DISCUSSED.
198	THIS PAPER DRAWS ON THEORISTS OF JURISDICTION TO MAKE VISIBLE HOW DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW TAKE EFFECT IN THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THROUGH THE LENS OF CARING SOCIETY V CANADA, A CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS CASE ABOUT THE FUNDING OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR INDIGENOUS CHILDREN, I EXPLORE AN IDEA OF JURISDICTIONAL JUSTICE THAT IS INHERENTLY CONNECTED TO THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AND FOCUSES ATTENTION ON POLITICAL, LEGAL AND HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS. I ARGUE THAT IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES POSED BY POPULIST POLITICS AND THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, THIS RELATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF JURISDICTION PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR BUILDING A SENSE OF LEGALITY THAT CAN SUSTAIN SHARED PUBLIC MEANING AND PROMOTE PRACTICES OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
199	IN ORDER TO ADDRESS "WICKED PROBLEMS", COMPLEX, MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES MUST BE ESTABLISHED. THESE STRUCTURES IN TURN REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS OF CONTROLS OVER PUBLIC POWER TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN IGNORED IN EU LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE AND RELEVANT RESEARCH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT FUTURE RESEARCH AND LEGISLATIVE DESIGN OF CONTROLS OVER PUBLIC POWER IN THE EU NEED TO BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF CONNECTING, ALIGNING AND MAKING INTERPLAY BETWEEN RELEVANT CONCEPTS, INSTITUTIONS, PROCEDURES AND SCOPES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTROL BELONGING TO THE MANY JURISDICTIONS, WHOSE ACTORS ARE INVOLVED IN THE EXECUTING OF (SHARED) TASKS IN THE EU. CONNECTING THE DISCIPLINES THAT STUDY THESE ISSUES IS A NECESSARY PREREQUISITE TO THIS ENDEAVOUR.
200	THE ARTICLE OFFERS A REVISITED LOOK AT THE CLASSIC JURISPRUDENCE OF THE ECTHR AND CJEU CONCERNING THE TURKISH REPUBLIC OF NORTHERN CYPRUS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PHENOMENON OF JUDICIAL DIALOGUE. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT AIMS TO EXAMINE WHETHER JUDICIAL DIALOGUE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COHERENT JURISPRUDENCE AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL REDRESS IN CASES INVOLVING UNRECOGNISED ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS. IT DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE THREATS FOR BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS RESULTING FROM INCONSISTENCIES WITHIN OWN JURISPRUDENCE OF THE RESPECTIVE COURT, AS WELL AS FROM LACK OF COHERENCE IN INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE SAME RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BY DIFFERENT COURTS.
201	THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE IS NECESSARILY A DEMOCRATIC STATE. TO WHAT EXTENT, THEN, THE CURRENT CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY IS ALSO A CRISIS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW? THE ANSWER SUGGESTED IN THIS ESSAY CONSIDERS AS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE CURRENT CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF THE POLITICAL-LEGAL FORM OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, CHARACTERIZED BY A HYPERTROPHY OF THE "LEGAL" FORMS OF MANAGEMENT OF THE SOCIAL RELATIONS AND POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING. DEMOCRACY RUNS THE RISK OF BEING CAGED IN IMMENSE AND OBSCURE SETS OF NORMATIVE DISPOSITIONS OF EVERY ORDER AND DEGREE, HINDERING THE PARTICIPATION OF ORDINARY CITIZENS AND RESERVING PUBLIC AFFAIRS TO THE EXPERTISE OF A FEW TECHNICIANS.
202	THE KING'S TWO BODIES IS, AS HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED, A GENEALOGY OF MODERN STATE POWER. BUT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING ELSE LESS CLEARLY RECOGNIZED. THE KING'S TWO BODIES IS A LAMENTATION. IN KANTOROWICZ'S POIGNANT EULOGY, THE SOVEREIGN THAT MEDIEVAL LAWYERS HAD MADE IN THE IMAGO DEI, WAS REVEALED AT LAST TO BE AN IDOL. PROFOUND REVERENCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW CRUMBLED INTO ABSENTMINDED LEGALITY. THE LAWFUL SOVEREIGN BECAME DIABOLICAL POWER, FOREVER DECIDING EXCEPTIONS BUT INCAPABLE OF JUSTICE OR GRACE. IN THE KING'S TWO BODIES, KANTOROWICZ MOURNFULLY SHOWS HOW THE DEATH AND TRAGIC AFTERLIFE OF A PARTICULAR MEDIEVAL CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY HELPED TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE HORRORS OF MODERN POLITICAL ABSOLUTISM AND STATE IDOLATRY.
203	IN THE DISCIPLINE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THE BALANCE WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE 21ST CENTURY BETWEEN THE HEGEMONY OF THE STATE AND SOCIAL FORCES HAS FAILED TO MATERIALIZE, AND THE HEGEMONIC STRUCTURE OF THE STATE CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS SUPREMACY. IN NATION-STATES UNABLE TO RECONCILE THE CONCEPTUAL PRINCIPLES OF HEGEMONY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE EFFECTS OF THIS ISSUE CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES ARE UNSOLVABLE. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR HIGHLIGHTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND VIOLENCE, THE OPPRESSION OF MATERIAL FORCES AND SOCIAL FORCES, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING TRANSFORMED FROM A NATION-STATE TO A DEMOCRATIC STATE.
204	THE NEW UKRAINE RECALLS THE OLD POLISH REPUBLIC NOT ONLY IN ITS MULTI-ETHNIC AND MULTI-RELIGIOUS CHARACTER. THE EUROMAIDAN'S STRUGGLE FOR WESTERN VALUES ALSO STANDS IN THE REPUBLICAN TRADITION. WHAT WAS THE "POLISH QUESTION" IN THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES IS TODAY "THE UKRAINIAN QUESTION": THE DRIVE OF A PATRONIZED PEOPLE FOR EMANCIPATION AND SELF-ASSERTION. THE QUESTION WHETHER A DEMOCRATIC UKRAINE GOVERNED BY RULE OF LAW IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RAW MATERIALS FROM SIBERIA, IS A TEST CASE FOR THE WEST. THE MUCH-MALIGNED EUROPEAN UNION HAS WITHSTOOD THE TEST AND PROVEN MORE CAPABLE OF ACTING THAN EXPECTED. THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN A REVIVAL OF THE TSARIST-STALINIST EMPIRE HAVE THE SHORT END OF THE STICK.
205	BASED ON SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A SURVEY APPLIED TO PORTUGUESE MUNICIPALITIES, THIS PAPER WILL DISCUSS AND ANALYZE EXISTING CONDITIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN MUNICIPAL SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES IN PORTUGAL. HOWEVER, SIGNS OF PARTICIPATORY CITIZENSHIP IN PORTUGUESE SOCIETY - AS WELL AS PARTICIPATION IN REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY-CAN NOT BE DISSOCIATED FROM THE NEW SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS EMERGED FROM THE 1974 REVOLUTION (INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, ACCESSION TO EUROPEAN COMMUNITY/EUROPEAN UNION, INTEGRATION IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALIZED INTERNATIONAL MARKET AND POLITICAL ARENA). THAT IS WHY THE DIFFICULTIES AND SUCCESSES IN THESE PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES HAVE TO BE READ I) IN THE LIGHT OF A RELATIVELY NEW DEMOCRATIC PATH AND II) AS A RESULT OF THE GROWING MOMENTUM OF INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE.
206	THE LIBERAL IDEA (TRADITION) IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ORIGINATES FROM THE DECLARATION OF BASIC LIBERAL VALUES IN THE 18TH CENTURY, NAMELY: INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, EQUALITY IN THE SENSE OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE CONTRACTUAL NATURE OF THE COEXISTENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE, THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. SINCE THE ENLIGHTENMENT PHILOSOPHY, THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND PROPERTY HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS BELONGING TO PEOPLE FOR LIFE AND INALIENABLE. THE IDEA OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IS INDISPUTABLE, CENTRAL TO LIBERALISM, AND THE REQUIREMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ACTS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL CONTROL. THUS, THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL TRADITION LAID THE FOUNDATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING INDIVIDUALISM AS A CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND SELF--EXPRESSION OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
207	WE EXAMINE WHETHER JUSTICES APPOINTED TO THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA ARE MORE LIKELY TO FIND IN FAVOUR OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THE PRIME MINISTER WHO APPOINTED THEM IS IN OFFICE THAN WHEN SUBSEQUENT PRIME MINISTERS ARE IN OFFICE, OVER THE PERIOD 1995 TO 2019. WE FIND EVIDENCE OF A LOYALTY EFFECT, EVEN WHEN SUBSEQUENT PRIME MINISTERS ARE OF THE SAME POLITICAL PARTY AS THE PRIME MINISTER WHO APPOINTED THEM. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN JUSTICES APPOINTED BY LABOR AND LIBERAL PRIME MINISTERS AND SHOW THAT THE LOYALTY EFFECT HOLDS FOR JUSTICES APPOINTED BY THE HOWARD AND TURNBULL GOVERNMENTS. THESE FINDINGS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE CENTRAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
208	NON-RACIALISM IS A DEEP-ROOTED IDEAL IN THE HISTORY OF RESISTANCE IN SOUTH AFRICA. IT IS NOT ONLY THE BASIS OF THE POST-APARTHEID LEGAL ORDER, BUT ALSO CRUCIAL TO THE FORM OF CAPITALISM. THIS PAPER REINTERPRETS NON-RACIALISM AND INEQUALITY IN POST-1994 SOUTH AFRICA BY REVISITING CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE NATURE OF THE STATE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT SHOWS THAT RACIAL INEQUALITY IS INSCRIBED IN THE NON-RACIAL FORM OF THE STATE. THE NON-RACIAL DEMOCRATIC SHELL CORRELATES WITH THE COMMODITY FORM. SCHOLARS HAVE NEGLECTED THE SHIFT IN THE FORM OF THE STATE AFTER 1994, PARTLY BECAUSE THEY FOCUS ON POLICY AND SEE THE STATE AS AN EXTERNAL STRUCTURE IN A RACIAL SOCIETY.
209	IN REGARDS TO THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS, THE EROSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE LAWS OF WAR, AS WELL AS THE VIOLENT STRUGGLE OVER TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, SELF-DETERMINATION AND ROLE OF KIN-STATES WILL PROBABLY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THREATS FOR THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE. OTHER CHALLENGES ARE INCREASING INCENTIVES FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ARMS RACE COUPLED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MODES OF WARFARE, AS WELL AS THE SPILL OVER OF THE BRUTAL CONFLICTS IN THE REGION OF MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA, THE RISING AGGRESSIVENESS OF AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS, LOOMING TRADE AND ENERGY CONFRONTATIONS AND THE FAILURES OF SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND INEQUALITY.
210	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A HERMENEUTIC MODEL BASED ON DUE PROCESS AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OR CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, WHICH ENABLES, IN THE APPLICATION OF PROCEDURAL RULES, THE ATTRIBUTION OF SENSE IN DEFENSE OF MAN/WOMAN AND HIS/HER WELL-KNOWN VALUES AS CULTURAL EXPRESSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. IT IS ABOUT TO VINDICATE THE GUARANTOR VOICE IN THE PROCESS, SO THAT IT FORMS AND DEVELOPS FROM ITS DIALECTICAL CHARACTER GOVERNED BY IMPARTIALITY, COOPERATION, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, AND HUMAN DIGNITY. IN THIS STRUCTURE, JUDGES ARE SPOKESMEN OF THE PRACTICAL REASON IN EACH SPECIFIC CASE AND, THEREFORE, THEY ASSUME THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO MAKE OF LAW THE BEST WORK OF ART.
211	THE ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF CAPITALISM CAN BE ILLUSTRATED THROUGH JOHN FORD'S WESTERNS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON SIX CLASSICS BY FORD THAT SHOW THE MOVE TOWARD MODERN ORDER, THE CREATION OF A NEW SOCIETY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. ECONOMIC FEATURES ARE PERVADING, FROM PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACTS TO MARKETS, MONEY, AND TRADE. FORD HAS BEEN DEPICTED AS A RADICAL CRITIC OF CAPITALISM, BUT HIS VIEWS PROVE TO BE MORE SUBTLE, AND THEY PRESENT THE INGREDIENTS OF CAPITALISM IN A PREPOLITICAL WORLD, A WORLD WITH PRIVATE SETTLERS AIMING TO BUILD NEW COMMUNITIES IN A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT, FREQUENTLY WITH NO POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS APART FROM THE ARMY AND WHERE CIVIL SOCIETYOR PRE-CIVIL SOCIETYDOMINATED.
212	THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE IS ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS APPOINTED TO REPRESENT ZACARIAS MOUSSAOUI IN THE UNITED STATES. MR. MOUSSAOUI IS THE ONLY PERSONFACING CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 PLOT. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES WITH A SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON SEVERAL TERRORISM CASES PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES. HE SEEKS TO ASSURE THE READERS THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS PARAMOUNT IN THE UNITED STATES. RECENT DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT-IN THE HAMDI AND GUANTANAMO CASES-THAT CONFIRM THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF EVEN THE MOST DEDICATED ENEMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WHICH DECISIONS POST-DATE THIS SUBMISSION, ONLY AFFIRM THE WRITER'S THEME.
213	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE MALAYSIAN JUDICIARY'S APPROACH TOWARD INTERPRETING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF MALAYSIA AND SITUATES IT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE NATION'S POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY. IT TRACES THE JUDICIARY'S MOVEMENT TOWARD A MORE RIGHTS-ORIENTED APPROACH FOLLOWED BY ITS MORE RECENT RETREAT, WHICH HAS BEEN MARKED BY STRICT FORMALISM AND INSULARITY IN SEVERAL APPELLATE COURT DECISIONS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE MALAYSIAN COURTS' JOURNEY TOWARD CONSTITUTIONAL REDEMPTION HAS BEEN UNEVEN SO FAR. IN ORDER TO RECLAIM ITS CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION AS A CO-EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE MALAYSIAN JUDICIARY MUST BE WILLING TO UPHOLD ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ASSERT ITS COMMITMENT TO CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
214	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES MOLDOVA'S POLITICAL EVOLUTION DURING ITS FIRST 25 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE. IT ARGUES THAT WHILE THE COUNTRY HAS GONE THROUGH 3 VERY DISTINCT PERIODS OF GOVERNANCE DURING THAT TIME, THE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE HOBBLED EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A STABLE DEMOCRATIC REGIME REMAINED CONSISTENT. THESE INCLUDED THE COUNTRY'S PRECARIOUS LOCATION IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND A DEEP CLEAVAGE REGARDING NATIONAL IDENTITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COUNTRY SETTLED INTO A PATTERN OF SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION AND, AT BEST, A DEEPLY FLAWED FORM OF DEMOCRACY. BY THE END OF THIS PERIOD, MOLDOVANS FACED THE TASK OF MOUNTING A RENEWED EFFORT TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER THEIR POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.
215	RENT ALLOCATION IS KEY TO NATURAL-RESOURCE RICH COUNTRIES' DEVELOPMENT. A LIFE CYCLE MODEL IS USED TO STUDY OPTIMAL RENT ALLOCATION CONSIDERING THE UNCERTAINTIES DERIVED FROM GOVERNMENT QUALITY AND RENT MEASUREMENT. CHILE'S PRIVATE COPPER INDUSTRY IS USED AS A CASE STUDY. RESULTS SHOW THAT BETWEEN 1988 TO 2018 ROUGHLY USD 161.7 BILLION OF COPPER RENT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 62.6% OF THE TOTAL RENT GENERATED BY THE INDUSTRY. GIVEN THE QUALITY OF CHILE'S GOVERNMENT (I.E., LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OVER CORRUPTION, AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW), RENT ALLOCATION HAS LIKELY BEEN SUBOPTIMAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IS LIKELY WARRANTED.
216	THE PAPER DESCRIBES COUNTRY RISK ASSESSMENT FROM THE INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE. WE PROVIDE A DETAILED LITERATURE REVIEW OF COUNTRY RISK, ITS DEFINITION AND SPECIFIC ASPECTS. WE ALSO DESCRIBE AND TEST THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SELECTED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS USING PANEL DATA REGRESSION. WE CONCLUDE THE GDP PER CAPITA, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, GROSS GOVERNMENT DEBT, CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND POLITICAL CONTROL INDEX OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE MAIN FACTORS INFLUENCING COUNTRY RISK IN OUR ANALYSIS. USING THE CLUSTERING WARD METHOD, WE DEFINE GROUPS OF THE SIMILAR EU COUNTRIES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RISK AND CHANGES WITHIN THEM IN THE PERIOD OF ONE DECADE. WE ALSO ANALYSE WHETHER THESE COUNTRIES FULFIL SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR INVESTING.
217	THE PAPERS DISCUSSES THE VIEWS OF SLOBODAN JOVANOVIC (1869-1958) ON SEVERAL PHENOMENA OF SERBIA'S POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE HUNDRED YEARS BETWEEN THE FIRST SERBIAN UPRISING IN 1804 AND THE FALL OF THE OBRENOVIC DYNASTY IN 1903, AND ON DIFFERENT POLITICAL SYSTEMS, LOOKING AT THE SOURCES ON WHICH HIS THOUGHT DREW UPON, THE IDEAS HE WAS GUIDED BY AND THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF HIS LEGAL AND SOCIO-POLITICAL THINKING. HIS MAJOR WORK, A LEGAL THEORY OF THE STATE, AS MOST OF HIS OTHER WRITINGS, WAS HIS OWN CONTRIBUTION TO WHAT HE HELD TO BE A NATIONAL MISSION, THE BUILDING OF A MODERN STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
218	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF JUDICIALISATION OF POLITICS IN NIGERIA'S DEMOCRATISATION EXPERIENCE AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF QUESTIONABLE JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON LEGAL AND POLITICAL THEORY AS WELL AS COMPARATIVE LAW PERSPECTIVES. FINDINGS - THE JUDICIARY FACES A DAUNTING TASK IN DEEPENING DEMOCRACY AND (RE)INSTITUTING THE RULE OF LAW. THE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES DERIVE IN PART FROM STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITHIN THE JUDICIARY, DEFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY CREDENTIALS AND THE COMPLEXITIES OF A TROUBLED TRANSITION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL MEDIATION OF POLITICAL TRANSITION REQUIRES A TRANSFORMED AND ACCOUNTABLE JUDICIARY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE ARTICLE CALLS ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AS A CARDINAL AND INTEGRAL PART OF POLITICAL TRANSITIONS.
219	THE ENGLISH MAGNA CARTA (1215) HAS LONG STOOD AS A SYMBOL OF HUMAN LIBERTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES ITS INTELLECTUAL ORIGINS, SUGGESTING THE EXISTENCE OF POSSIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE CHARTER BY THE CONTEMPORARY IUS COMMUNE, THE AMALGAM OF ROMAN AND CANON LAWS THAT HAD EMERGED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE REVIVAL OF LEGAL STUDIES ON THE CONTINENT IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY. COMPARING THE SUBSTANCE OF OVER HALF OF THE CHAPTERS WITH THE CONTEMPORARY IUS COMMUNE, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT MANY SIMILARITIES EXISTED. ACCEPTING THE POSSIBILITY OF USE OF CONTINENTAL SOURCES IN DRAFTING THE CHARTER HELPS EXPLAIN OTHERWISE PUZZLING FEATURES IN IT. IT ALSO ACCORDS WITH COMMON PATTERNS IN LEGAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE TIME.
220	OUR GLOBALIZING WORLD IS PRESENTLY IN A STATE OF GLOBAL TURMOIL. WHILE FELT EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD, IT IS THE MIDDLE EAST IN GENERAL, AND SYRIA AND IRAQ IN PARTICULAR, WHERE THE MEANING AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE GLOBAL TURMOIL HAVE RECENTLY COALESCED. AS A REGIONAL HEGEMON BORDERING SYRIA AND IRAQ, TURKEY IS SITUATED AT THE HEART OF THESE CHALLENGES. DESPITE THE EXISTING STALEMATE IN TURKEY-EU RELATIONS, TURKEY CAN DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES MORE EFFECTIVELY IF TURKEY AND THE EU WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP COMMON RESPONSES TO THEM ON THE BASIS OF HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLES AND VALUES. IN LINE WITH THE 'EU GLOBAL STRATEGY,' TURKEY AND THE EU COULD WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO SIGNIFICANT SECURITY RISKS THEY FACE AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION AND MEDIATION. THERE IS A NEED TO REVITALIZE TURKEY-EU RELATIONS IN A WAY TRUST AND COLLABORATION REPLACES SKEPTICISM AND INSTRUMENTALISM.
221	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES HOW LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES SHOULD REACT TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A IUS CONSTITUTIONALE COMMUNE IN LATIN AMERICA, IT ARGUES THAT THE GREATEST CHALLENGE LIES IN PASSING THE INTER-AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC TEST, WHICH AT THE INTERSECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW CAN GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH INTER-AMERICAN STANDARDS. A NEW RATIONALE DERIVES FROM THE MECHANISMS ADOPTED BY THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, IN THE EXERCISE OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE MANDATE IN TIMES OF PANDEMIC. IT CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING A "DOUBLE" DEMOCRATIC TEST IN LATIN AMERICA THAT RELIES ON THE NOTION OF COLLECTIVE GUARANTEE OF HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS.
222	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW HIERARCHY AND NETWORKS AS DIFFERENT MODES OF GOVERNANCE INTERACT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE RUSSIAN (SEMI-) AUTHORITARIANISM. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY IS BASED ON 13 CASE STUDIES FOCUSING ON POLICY-MAKING IN ETHNIC POLICY AS WELL AS ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN THE RUSSIAN REGIONS. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT HORIZONTAL PATTERNS OF GOVERNANCE DO EXIST, SINCE RESOURCE INTERDEPENDENCY BETWEEN STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS NECESSITATE INTERACTIONS. CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS CAN SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCE THEIR INTERESTS, IF THEY ARE IN LINE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. THE WEAK RULE OF LAW AND HOLES IN LAW, HOWEVER, UNDERMINE HORIZONTAL GOVERNANCE AND FACILITATE PATTERNS OF VERTICAL GOVERNANCE. FACTORS CURTAILING THESE TENDENCIES CAN YET BE IDENTIFIED.
223	ALTHOUGH ACHIEVING IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH DURING THE ECONOMIC REFORM PERIOD, CHINA HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY RAMPANT CORRUPTION AND A WIDENING INCOME GAP. HOW CAN THE COEXISTENCE OF THESE TWO PHENOMENA BE EXPLAINED? IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT BEFORE 1994, THE COEXISTENCE WAS INDUCED BY A SERIES OF EXPEDIENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS TO STIMULATE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES AND AFTER 1994, IT WAS ENTRENCHED BECAUSE OF THE SLOW PROGRESS IN THE OVERALL REFORM TOWARD BECOMING A MARKET ECONOMY AND BECAUSE OF INAPPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AND THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT ACTION IN INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORMS NEED TO BE ACCELERATED TO IMPROVE MARKET INSTITUTIONS AND TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW.
224	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW AND THE RULES AND PROCEDURES IN THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES. TO DO SO THE AUTHOR TAKES THE CONTROVERSY ON APPOINTMENTS IN THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL IN 2015 AS AN EXAMPLE. THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER IS THUS DEVOTED TO EXPOSE THE POLISH CONTROVERSY ON JUDGES ' APPOINTMENTS AND ITS SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION UNTIL THE FINAL CAPTURE OF THE TRIBUNAL BY THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS. SECONDLY, THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON THE REACTION OF THE ECHR TO THAT ISSUE, ANALYSING ITS JUDGMENT XERO FLOR, WHICH WAS DELIVERED ON 7TH MAY 2021. FINALLY, SOME GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ON THE RIGHT TO A TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW, THE PROCEDURE OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY.
225	THIS CONTRIBUTION ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF HOW RADICAL RIGHT-WING POPULIST PARTIES IN WESTERN EUROPE FRAME THE ISSUE OF JUDICIAL POWER. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW IN-DEPTH EMPIRICAL ANALYSES ON THE TOPIC - A GAP THAT THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO FILL. THE PAPER WILL COMPARE TWO RADICAL RIGHT-WING POPULIST PARTIES, THE DUTCH FREEDOM PARTY AND THE SWISS PEOPLE'S PARTY, BY FOCUSING ON PARTY MANIFESTOS, PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS AND PUBLIC SPEECHES BY THEIR LEADERS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THESE PARTIES AND LEADERS TEND TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW BY CALLING THE IMPARTIAL POSITION OF JUDGES AND THE AUTONOMY OF THE JUDICIARY INTO QUESTION IN THE NAME OF A POPULAR, NATIONAL AND POLITICAL SOVEREIGNISM.
226	GUATEMALAN POLITICS WERE DOMINATED IN 2018 BY POLITICAL STRIFE BETWEEN THE JIMMY MORALES ADMINISTRATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA (CICIG). THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES IN GUATEMALA CONTINUE TO BE CORRUPTION AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE-OF-LAW. THE YEAR BEGAN WITH BUT GUARDED OPTIMISM THAT CICIG COULD CONTINUE ITS WORK DESPITE WORRIES ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY, BUT ENDED WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT THREATENED CICIG'S WORK IN GUATEMALA. WITH GENERAL ELECTIONS APPROACHING IN 2019, DEMOCRACY IN GUATEMALA HANGS IN THE BALANCE. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF 2018, THE MAKEUP OF THE ELECTION WAS STILL IN DOUBT AND GUATEMALA WAS IN A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.
227	THIS PAPER ENDEAVORS TO STUDY OF THE CLAUSE OF THE SOCIAL STATE BY STARTING FROM THE THESIS THAT IT SHOULD HAVE CONCRETE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENT, THE SAME WAY THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF A DEMOCRACY OPERATING UNDER THE RULE OF LAW DO. THIS CONCRETE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENT INCREASES WITH THE WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS RECOGNIZED IN TITLE I OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION. THE STUDY OF ALL OF THIS IS CARRIED OUT ASSUMING THAT BOTH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SOCIAL STATE AND SOCIAL RIGHTS MUST SERVE TO ADVANCE A PERSON'S FREEDOM, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SCOPE OF PROVISION OF SERVICES BY THE STATE. FINALLY, THE PAPER BRIEFLY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF MORPHOLOGY AND CONTENT OF THE RIGHT TO DECENT HOUSING.
228	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE IMPACT OF ECONOMY, EFFICIENCY, AND EFFECTIVENESS-THE 'THREE ES'-UPON AGENCIES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM (POLICE AND PROSECUTION, FORENSIC INVESTIGATION, COURTS, PROBATION SERVICES, AND PRISONS) IN THE 1980S IN BRITAIN. IT ALSO ASKS WHETHER WHAT IS HAPPENING TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SIGNIFIES A SHIFT FROM 'RULE OF LAW' TOWARDS 'MANAGERIAL JUSTICE'. IT ARGUES THAT THE EMPHASIS UPON 'CONSUMER CONTROL' HAS LED NOT TO MORE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY BUT TO INCREASED CENTRAL CONTROL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PRACTICE. FINALLY, IT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THESE TRENDS FORM PART OF A WIDER POLITICAL STRATEGY TO 'MANAGE' SOCIAL TENSIONS WITHIN BRITISH SOCIETY WROUGHT BY THE RETURN TO NOTIONS OF 'FREE MARKET' CAPITALISM, ENTERPRISE CULTURE, AND THE 'STRONG STATE'.
229	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FROM 1996 TO 2015 FOR 192 COUNTRIES AND SPECIFICALLY LATIN AMERICA. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EACH 0.1-POINT INCREASE IN INSTITUTIONS IMPACTS A 3.9% IMPROVEMENT IN LATIN AMERICAN PER CAPITA OUTPUT VERSUS A 2.6% EFFECT ON WORLD DEVELOPMENT. THIS NEW EVIDENCE FROM LATIN AMERICA SHOWS A MISSING OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AT HIGHER ANNUAL PACE THAN THE 2.14% AVERAGE, MAINLY DUE TO THE DETERIORATION IN RULE OF LAW. WE CONJECTURE THE EFFICIENCY OF MONETARY/FISCAL POLICIES WILL IMPROVE IF POLICY MAKERS EMPHASIZE PROJECTS THAT FOSTER IMPROVEMENTS TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, PUBLIC SPENDING QUALITY AND FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY.

230	TODAY, WE CAN SEE A REVIVAL OF FORMALIST TENDENCIES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL RULES INSIDE LEGAL POSITIVISM AND NATURAL LAW THEORY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MOVEMENT IS ETHICAL AND POLITICAL: THE DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. A RENOWNED MEMBER OF NATURAL LAW THEORY AS JOHN FINNIS IS AN ADVOCATE OF THE FORMALIST MOVEMENT IN THE INTERPRETATION. HIS THEORY OF NATURAL LAW AND BASIC GOODS BRINGS HIM TO DEMAND THE STRICT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE LEGAL PRECEPT TO PROTECT LEGAL CERTAINTY. NOTWITHSTANDING, HIS FORMALISM DOES NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM. EVEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF HIS THEORY OF JUDICIAL DECISION, IS EVIDENT THE NECESSITY OF NON-FORMAL HERMENEUTICAL TOOLS TO FULFILL INTERPRETATIVE TASKS.
231	CHINA HAS MOVED TOWARD HUMAN RIGHTS LAW INTERNATIONALLY AND DOMESTICALLY SINCE THE LATE 1970S. THEIR ECONOMIC REFORM NECESSITATES THE INTRODUCTION OF LAW IN CONJUNCTION WITH BUILDING A MARKET ECONOMY. AS A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, CHINA CANNOT AVOID INTEGRATING INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW INTO ITS SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE, AND BEIJING HAS FOUND SOFT RIGHTS LAW MANAGEABLE. WESTERN RIGHTS PRESSURE SINCE 1989 HAS HAD AN INDIRECT IMPACT. BEIJING SEES LEGAL REFORM AND THE SIGNING OF INTERNATIONAL RIGHTS CONVENTIONS AS EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS. WHILE SOMEWHAT LIMITED, CHINA'S ADOPTION OF RIGHTS LAWS AFFECTS HOW DOMESTIC POLITICS IS PLAYED OUT AND LEADS TO THE CREATION OF A LEGAL PROFESSION INTERESTED IN PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
232	WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND THE PENAL SYSTEM IS EXPRESSED IN THE PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND THEIR PRIMARY MATERIAL INTERESTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CRITICAL POINTS BETWEEN THE DEMANDS OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CRIMINAL ORDER. SUCH IS THE CASE OF THE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, PROVIDED FOR BY THE CONSTITUTION AND DETAILED BY THE SECONDARY PROVISIONS OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, A MATTER CONTEMPLATED IN THE EXTENSIVE PROCEDURAL REFORM THAT ADVANCED IN LATIN AMERICA AT THE END OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND CONTINUES IN THE TWENTY-FIRST. IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES I WILL DEAL DIRECTLY WITH WHAT THE MEXICAN CONSTITUTIONAL NORM CALLS INFORMAL PRETRIAL DETENTION.
233	RECENT REFORMS REGARDING THE EUROPEAN COURTS RAISE THE QUESTION IN WHICH WAY DO 'NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT' PRINCIPLES INFLUENCE THE EUROPEAN JUDICIAL ORGANISATION AND HOW IS A BALANCE STRUCK BETWEEN THESE PRINCIPLES AND CLASSIC 'RULE OF LAW' PRINCIPLES? THE ARTICLE FIRST PRESENTS A CLASSIFICATION OF THESE TYPES OF PRINCIPLES IN THE FRAMEWORK FOR DISCUSSION REGARDING THE EUROPEAN JUDICIAL ORGANISATION. STARTING OUT FROM TWO PARADIGMS, AN INQUIRY IS MADE INTO THE STATUS OF THE TWO SETS OF PRINCIPLES IN THE PRESENT-DAY EUROPEAN 'CONSTITUTIONAL' FRAMEWORK. SECOND, THE INTERACTION OF PRINCIPLES IS INVESTIGATED WITH REGARD TO A NUMBER OF CURRENT DILEMMAS, INCLUDING THE DEMARCATION OF THE JUDICIAL DOMAIN, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COURTS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF JUDICIAL COMPETENCES.
234	THE CITIZENS OF POSTCOMMUNIST STATES HAVE RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF TRUST IN THEIR BASIC POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT TO CONSOLIDATE THE ADVANCES TOWARDS CIVIL SOCIETY AND DEMOCRACY PARTICULAR ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO STRENGTHENING TRUST. TRUST REQUIRES NOT JUST THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK APPROPRIATE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW - ALREADY SUBSTANTIALLY IN PLACE - BUT ALSO AN APPRECIATION OF POLITICS AND CIVIL SOCIETY AS SPHERES OF CONTINUING DIVERSITY, COMPETITION AND CONFLICT. THE DEFICIT OF TRUST CAN BE ADDRESSED BY A LEADERSHIP EXEMPLARY IN ITS SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST, AND BY AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW, ADVERSARIAL POLITICS.

235	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE USE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN UNITED KINGDOM AND AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THERE REMAINS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING USE OF THE DOCTRINE, PARTICULARLY IN AUSTRALIA. THE ARTICLE DEFENDS PROPORTIONALITY ON THE BASIS IT REFLECTS THE RULE OF LAW. ITS FLEXIBILITY IS AN ASSET. ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROPORTIONALITY ARE CONSIDERED WEAK. THE USE OF PROPORTIONALITY REFLECTS A CULTURE OF JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF GOVERNMENT POWER IN A WAY THAT IMPACTS AN INDIVIDUAL'S HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH REFLECTS AUSTRALIA'S LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE THEN CONSIDERS APPLICATION OF PROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLES TO VICTORIA'S MOOTED PANDEMIC LAWS. IT FINDS THAT PROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLES PROVIDE A MORE FERTILE GROUND FOR EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED EXTREME MEASURES THAN WEDNESBURY UNREASONABLENESS.
236	OVER THE COURSE OF AMERICAN HISTORY, A PERVASIVE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE HAS EMERGED ON NATIVE AMERICAN RESERVATIONS AS THE RESULT OF UNIQUE INSTITUTIONS THAT GOVERN THOSE LANDS. THE FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY AND AN ELABORATE WEB OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND TRIBAL POLICIES AFFECT THE LIBERTIES AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF NATIVE AMERICANS. THESE UNIQUE INSTITUTIONS IMPOSE HIGH COSTS ON INDIVIDUAL NATIVE AMERICANS WHEN THEY TRY TO ENGAGE IN MOST ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE COMPLEX INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF NATIVE AMERICAN GOVERNANCE THAT INCREASES POVERTY, LIMITS ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND RESTRICTS INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. THE PERVASIVENESS OF BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL HAS ALSO SPURRED NEGATIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, ERODED THE RULE OF LAW, AND HAMPERED MARKETS FROM WORKING EFFICIENTLY.
237	THE EASTERN NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE EU IS USUALLY SEEN AS AN AREA OF CONTESTATION WITH RUSSIA, WHERE THE LATTER HAS A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON EU INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, WHEN THE INFLUENCE OF THE EU AND RUSSIA ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY (ENP) ACTION PLAN IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA IS TESTED SYSTEMATICALLY, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNMENT PREVAILED AS A MUCH STRONGER PREDICTOR FOR RULE ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION: DOMESTIC ADOPTION COSTS ACCOUNTED BOTH FOR EFFECTIVE RULE TRANSFER AND FOR THE LACK OF IT, UNDERLINING THE IMPORTANCE OF DOMESTIC FACTORS IN PROCESSES OF EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE EVEN DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF MAJOR EXTERNAL POWERS.
238	THIS TEXT CONSTITUTES THE ANSWER OF THE AUTHOR OF THE ABOVE QUOTED BOOK TO THREE COMMENTS ABOUT IT FORMULATED BY ERNESTO GARZON IN ITS PROLOGUE. THESE COMMENTS REFERRED TO DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE HISTORICITY OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS THEORIES PROPOSED BY THE AUTHOR AND CRITICISED BY GARZON; THE PATTERN OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION REQUIRED BY THESE HUMAN RIGHTS THEORIES: AN ASSOCIATION OF DEMOCRATIC STATES VERSUS A DEMOCRATIC INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTION WHICH IS "INTERVENTIONIST" IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS; AND THE MORAL RELEVANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN DIGNITY WHICH THE AUTHOR BASES ON IDENTITY AND "RULE OF LAW" RIGHTS, WHILE GARZON CONSIDERS IT TO BE MORE GENERALLY THE BASEMENT OF A MORALLY ACCEPTABLE LEGAL ORDER.
239	"NATION-BUILDING" IS AN INCREASINGLY FREQUENT ACTIVITY OF WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND THE UNITED NATIONS, WITH KOSOVO AN IMPORTANT RECENT EXAMPLE. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RECONSTRUCTION BY THE UNITED NATIONS OF KOSOVO'S INTERNAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE FROM 1999 TO 2004. IT ANALYZES UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES TO BUILD DEMOCRATIC POLICE AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THROUGH A MODEL OF SECURITY RECONSTRUCTION, IT EXAMINES IN DETAIL THE PRIMARY SECURITY CHALLENGES FACING KOSOVO, THE SPECIFIC EFFORTS THE UNITED NATIONS MADE TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, THE ULTIMATE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RECONSTRUCTION IN ESTABLISHING STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW, AND THE LINKAGES BETWEEN RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS AND DEMOCRACY. IT CONCLUDES WITH SEVERAL LESSONS FOR IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE.
240	IN THIS ARTICLE, PAUL HOFFMAN, THE CHAIR OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, PRESENTS AMNESTY'S VIEW THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THE "WAR ON TERRORISM" HAS BEEN WAGED THREATENS TO UNDERMINE THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK SO PAINSTAKINGLY BUILT SINCE WORLD WAR II. WRITTEN BEFORE THE ABU GHRAIB REVELATIONS BECAME PUBLIC, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT ABANDONING HUMAN RIGHTS IN TIMES OF CRISIS IS SHORTSIGHTED AND SELF-DEFEATING. A "WAR ON TERRORISM" WAGED WITHOUT RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW UNDERMINES THE VERY VALUES THAT IT PRESUMES TO PROTECT. WE MUST RESTORE THE BALANCE BETWEEN LIBERTY AND SECURITY BY REASSERTING THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK, WHICH PROVIDES FOR LEGITIMATE AND EFFECTIVE EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO TERRORIST ATTACKS.
241	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT DOMESTIC SOCIAL CONFLICTS ARE A KEY TO UNDERSTANDING WHY GROWTH RATES LACK PERSISTENCE AND WHY SO MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED A GROWTH COLLAPSE SINCE THE MID-1970S. IT EMPHASIZES, IN PARTICULAR, THE MANNER IN WHICH SOCIAL CONFLICTS INTERACT WITH EXTERNAL SHOCK ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS OF CONFLICT-MANAGEMENT ON THE OTHER. ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS. COUNTRIES THAT EXPERIENCED THE SHARPEST DROPS IN GROWTH AFTER 1975 WERE THOSE WITH DIVIDED SOCIETIES (AS MEASURED BY INDICATORS OF INEQUALITY, ETHNIC FRAGMENTATION, AND THE LIKE) AND WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT (PROXIED BY INDICATORS OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS, AND SOCIAL SAFETY NETS).
242	THIS RESEARCH AIMS AT EXAMINING THE IMPACT THAT GLOBALIZATION HAS ON CRIMINAL POLICY AND CRIMINAL LAW IN THE SO-CALLED "RISK SOCIETY." SUCH A PROBLEM CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE GREATEST CONCERNS ON THE CURRENT CRIMINOLOGICAL AGENDA DUE TO THE DANGERS THESE TRENDS POSE FOR THE RESPECT OF THE CITIZENS' FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES, TRADITIONALLY INTERPRETED AS LIMITS TO IUS PUNIENDI UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS REPRESENTS BASIC LEVEL RESEARCH WHOSE MAIN RESULT IS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF TODAY'S CRIMINAL POLICY AND CRIMINAL LAW. IT CONCLUDES WITH SOME PROPOSALS THAT ARE DEEMED USEFUL TO SHAPE A COHERENT AND REASONABLE CRIMINAL POLICY, WHICH CAN BE GENERALIZED TO ANY CONTEXT GOVERNED BY A DEMOCRATIC CRIMINAL SYSTEM.
243	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT GENDER ISSUES ARE BECOMING POLITICISED IN NOVEL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WAYS IN CONTEXTS WHERE ARMED INTERVENTIONS USHER IN NEW BLUEPRINTS FOR GOVERNANCE AND 'DEMOCRATISATION'. USING ILLUSTRATIONS FROM CONSTITUTIONAL AND ELECTORAL PROCESSES IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, IT ANALYSES HOW THE NATURE OF EMERGING POLITICAL SETTLEMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTS OF HIGH RISK AND INSECURITY MAY JEOPARDISE STATED INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS TO A WOMEN'S RIGHTS AGENDA. THE DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN STATED AIMS AND OBSERVED OUTCOMES BECOMES PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN CONTEXTS WHERE SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE SEVERELY COMPROMISED, WHERE ISLAM BECOMES A STAKE IN POWER STRUGGLES AMONG CONTENDING FACTIONS AND WHERE ETHNIC/SECTARIAN CONSTITUENCIES ARE LOCKED IN STRUGGLES OF REPRESENTATION IN DEFENCE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE RIGHTS.
244	COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS PERMEATED WITH STRONG VARNISH PRAYED JURISDICTION, AND ALTHOUGH OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANY TOPICS, THIS PRESENTS GREAT CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FROM THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. WE SHALL SEE INTERPRETIVE HISTORICAL SOURCES WHICH DEVELOPED THE DIALECT THAT OCCURS BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE ENTREATY IN COLOMBIAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN HERMENEUTIC PARADIGMS, SUCH AS POSITIVISM AND NATURAL LAW, WERE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEGAL APPRECIATIONS UNDER THE PRAYED JURISDICTION. LIKEWISE, THE INFLUENCE OF NEW CONCEPTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, INCLUDING MAIN SUCH AS HAND IURA CURIA NOVIT, OFFER APPROACHES TOWARDS EFFECTIVE MATERIAL JUSTICE IN ADMINISTRATIVE LABOR LAW.
245	THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WAYS IN WHICH ECOLOGISTS AND LAWYERS VIEW UNCERTAINTY: IN THE STUDY OF ECOLOGY, UNCERTAINTY PROVIDES A CATALYST FOR EXPLORATION, WHEREAS UNCERTAINTY IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ISSUE IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING IN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, WHERE THE TENSIONS BETWEEN LAW AND ECOLOGY BECOME APPARENT. RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGE UNCERTAINTIES IN MANAGEMENT ACTIONS, LEGAL FRAMEWORKS OFTEN FORCE A FALSE SENSE OF CERTAINTY IN LINKING CAUSE AND EFFECT. WHILE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO DEAL WITH UNCERTAINTY, LAWS AND LEGAL WRANGLING CAN BE OBSTACLES TO IMPLEMENTATION. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE RECOMMEND RESILIENCE-BASED GOVERNANCE "ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE" AS A MEANS TO BEGIN BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN LAW AND ECOLOGY.
246	SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MODERNITY, THE USE OF RHETORIC HAVE PREVAILED; THAT IS, THE TECHNIQUE OF PERVERTING THE LANGUAGE GIVING CONCEPTS DIFFERENT MEANINGS PRESUMING NOTHING HAVE CHANGED WHEN IN FACT, IT HAS OCCURRED. THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTION, IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY MODIFIED ITS SENSE FROM THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS MORAL. IN THIS ARTICLE THE INTENTION IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE NATURE OF THIS CHANGE AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAIM ON THE THE "OLD CONSTITUTIONALISM" VALIDITY AND ALSO THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL WILL BEGINNING ON A CRITICAL READING OF CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM AND CONSIDERING ITS TENDENCY TO CONSTITUTIONALIZE OR MATERIALIZE THE LAW, IRONICALLY RISKING THE SAME VALUES INTENDED TO DEFEND.
247	ALONG HIS WORK FERRAJOLI HAS DEMONSTRATED AN UNQUESTIONABLE ENGAGEMENT TO THE PEACE AND AGAINST THE WAR. HIS THEORY ABOUT INTERNATIONAL ORDER, THUS, FIT WELL WITHIN THE SO CALLED LEGAL PACIFISM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO HIGHLIGHT HOW THE MAIN FEATURES THAT PACIFISM ARE PRESENT IN HIS PRINCIPIA IURIS. I WILL PAY ATTENTION TO ISSUES SUCH AS NORVATIVE HIERARCHY MODEL PROPOSED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER, AND TO THE CONCEPT OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY. ALSO IS REMARKABLE THE RADICAL DENY OF ITS LEGAL NATURE TO THE WAR, AS THE ABSOLUTE NEGATION OF LAW AND RIGHTS. FINALLY, WE'LL SEE THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER THAT FERRAJOLI PROPOSE TO OVERCOME THE CURRENT CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
248	THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RULES, PRINCIPLES, VALUES AND POSTULATES REMAINS A MYSTERY TO MANY OPERATORS OF THE LAW. AIMING AT DISCUSSING THE ISSUE THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW WILL BE SHOWN, BRINGING THE COUNTERPOINT BETWEEN THE NATURAL LAW AND LEGAL POSITIVISM WITH THE RISE AND FALL OF THIS LAST ONE. THEN WE WILL PROCEED TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TEXT AND STANDARD INTERPRETATION OF THE FACTS AND LAW. WE WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RULES AND PRINCIPLES. WE WILL DISCUSS THE EXISTENCE OF NORMS AND WHAT THE LEGAL NATURE OF PROPORTIONALITY, FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY WOULD BE LIKE. FINALLY, WE WILL DISCUSS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN VALUES AND PRINCIPLES.
249	INFORMAL PROCESSES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN POLITICS. THE BANDWIDTH REACHES FROM WORK IN CONSTITUTIONALLY UNFORESEEN ADVISORY COMMISSIONS AND CORRUPTION TO MAFIA-LIKE PRACTISES. INFORMALITY OCCURS WHEREVER FORMAL INSTITUTIONS REVEAL A DEFICIT IN PERFORMANCE. WHETHER INFORMAL PRACTICES ARE FUNCTIONAL OR DYSFUNCTIONAL FOR BOOSTING THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS' EFFICIENCY IS CONTROVERSIAL AND DEPENDS ON THE MEASURE APPLIED. OFTEN, THE MEASURE IS LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BASED ON RULE OF LAW. INFORMAL PRACTISES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE HAVE THEIR OWN CHARACTER. THEY FEED ON THE LEGACY OF CENTRALISED SOCIALISM AND THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS. THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY, SO FAR NEGLECTED, OFFERS A MEANS OF ANALYSING AND ASSESSING INFORMAL POLITICS IN THE EAST.
250	DESPITE THE SPREAD OF ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY, FEW LATIN AMERICAN MEDIA SYSTEMS TODAY ENCOURAGE THE DEEPENING OF DEMOCRACY. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS OUTCOME TO (A) GENERALIZED WEAKNESS IN THE RULE OF LAW, (B) HOLDOVER AUTHORITARIAN LEGISLATION, (C) OLIGARCHIC OWNERSHIP OF MEDIA OUTLETS, (D) UNEVEN JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS, AND (E) LIMITED AUDIENCE ACCESS TO DIVERSE SOURCES OF INFORMATION. REFORMS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS COULD INCLUDE THE APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL PROSECUTORS TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES AGAINST JOURNALISTS; REPLACEMENT OF CRIMINAL LIBEL LAWS WITH CIVIL PROCEDURES; LEGISLATION PROTECTING JOURNALISTS' SOURCES AND GUARANTEEING TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NONPARTISAN BOARDS TO ALLOCATE BROADCAST CONCESSIONS, ADMINISTER STATE-OWNED STATIONS, AND DISTRIBUTE GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING; USER FEES TO EXPAND PUBLIC MEDIA; AND VARIOUS MEASURES TO ENHANCE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.
251	IN THE ABSENCE OF STATUTORY RULES ON THE MATTER, BELGIAN COURTS TRADITIONALLY APPLIED A STRICT EXCLUSIONARY RULE FOR ILLEGALLY GATHERED EVIDENCE AND ITS FRUITS. THE COURT OF CASSATION IN 2003 MADE A SPECTACULAR U-TURN AND PROHIBITED EXCLUSION OF ILLEGALLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE BY CRIMINAL COURTS, WITH ONLY VERY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. PARLIAMENT SUBSEQUENTLY INCORPORATED THESE JUDGE-MADE PRINCIPLES INTO A BINDING STATUTORY RULE. AS A NEW CODE IS ABOUT TO BE DEBATED IN PARLIAMENT, THE TIME IS RIGHT TO QUESTION THE "NORMALISATION" OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' DISRESPECT FOR THE RULES. THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE RESTORED BY MAKING EXCLUSION OF ILLEGALLY GATHERED EVIDENCE THE RULE, BUT EXCEPTIONALLY ALLOWING ITS USE UPON CONSIDERATION OF THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS.
252	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REGIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND FIRMS' PRODUCTIVITY IN THE PERIOD 2010-14 IS INVESTIGATED BY REGRESSING A MEASURE OF TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY FOR EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES ON A REGIONAL LEVEL INDEX OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ITS COMPONENTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. STRONG EVIDENCE IS FOUND THAT BETTER LOCAL INSTITUTIONS HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES BECOME MORE PRODUCTIVE. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS INTERPLAYS WITH SOME FIRM CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS FIRMS' SIZE, AGE, HUMAN CAPITAL AND PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL, AS WELL AS FIRMS' OPERATING SECTOR. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEFINITION OF SUITABLE STRATEGIES TO FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE EUROPEAN REGIONS.
253	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PLAY HECUBA REIMAGINED, WRITTEN BY AUSTRALIAN PLAYWRIGHT CARL CAULFIELD AND FIRST PERFORMED IN OCTOBER 2016. THREE PREVIOUS TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY ENGLISH VERSIONS OF EURIPIDES' HECUBA ARE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED BEFORE CAULFIELD'S ADAPTATION IS EXAMINED. CAULFIELD'S MODIFICATIONS TO, REJECTION OF ABBREVIATION AND AMPLIFICATION OF PARTS OF EURIPIDES' HECUBA ARE ILLUSTRATED, AND THIS SECTION IS FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HOW HE EXPRESSES THE FOUR MAIN THEMES OF HIS NEW PLAY: A POST-RELIGIOUS WORLD, PTSD, THE POWER OF WORDS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE TEXT WAS REALIZED IN THE PREMIERE PRODUCTION BEFORE A CONCLUSION THAT EVALUATES THE PLAY, AND SUMMARIZES THE PLAYWRIGHT'S APPROACH TO ADAPTING HECUBA.
254	THIS ARTICLE MAKES A CASE FOR THE SURPRISING CONCLUSION THAT THE ANCIENT ISRAELITE TRIBES AND PEOPLES, A GROUP THAT SAW ITSELF AS A NATION UNDER GOD'S SPECIAL CARE AND AUTHORITY-AS A KIND OF THEOCRACY-SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN A LEGITIMATELY SELF-GOVERNING SOCIETY, COMPLETE WITH MANY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OF REPUBLICAN FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE A RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, PROTECTIONS OF DUE PROCESS, AND A SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE ARGUMENT PROCEEDS BY IDENTIFYING THESE FEATURES IN NARRATIVE ACCOUNTS OF ISRAEL'S HISTORY IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES, WHICH GROUND GOD'S POLITICAL AUTHORITY IN THE DEVICE OF A COVENANT.
255	THE PRESENT WORK REASSESSES THE IMPACT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRACY ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN OIL-ABUNDANT COUNTRIES. TO THIS END, WE ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF HOST COUNTRIES' INSTITUTIONS ON GREENFIELD FDI, USING A GRAVITY EQUATION FOR A DATASET THAT COVERS 182 COUNTRIES DURING 2003-2012. OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT COMPLIANCE TO RULE OF LAW, LACK OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY COULD BOOST NEW FDI LINKS THROUGH THE EXTENSIVE MARGIN. OUR RESULTS COULD NOT RULE OUT THE "OIL CURSE", MEANING THAT OIL PRODUCERS ATTRACT FEWER NEW GREENFIELD PROJECTS THAN SIMILAR COUNTRIES WITHOUT OIL. UNLIKE OTHER STUDIES, WE SHOW THAT THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS IS NOT NECESSARILY UNDERMINED BY THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES.
256	JAPAN'S ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEKONG REGION SINCE THE 1990S NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY FROM AN ECONOMIC BUT ALSO FROM A DIPLOMATIC PERSPECTIVE. JAPAN SEEKS TO COLLABORATE WITH ASEAN IN FACILITATING MULTILATERAL "POLITICAL DIALOGUE" IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND BUILDING AN EAST ASIAN ORDER BASED ON "UNIVERSAL VALUES" SUCH AS DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE MEKONG REGION COULD BE THE "WEAKEST LINK" OF ASEAN. AFTER OUTLINING JAPAN'S TWENTY-YEAR UNDERTAKING TO CULTIVATE MEKONG-JAPAN COOPERATION, THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT IT IS TIME TO BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THE COOPERATION AND ACCELERATE JAPAN'S "PROACTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO PEACE" POLICY TO COPE WITH THE CHANGING SECURITY ENVIRONMENT.
257	IN THIS PAPER WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE REASONS THAT SUPPORT THE LEGAL EXISTENCE OF INDUCTION INTO PROSTITUTION AS A CRIME IN A DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE OF RULE OF LAW, WHERE THE EXISTENCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY OF THE CITIZEN IS CONSTITUTIONALLY STATED. FROM THIS INTRODUCTION POINT ALONG WITH THE HISTORIC HAPPENINGS OF THIS CRIME OFFERED BY THE NATIONAL DOCTRINE OF ALL OUR TIMES, WE PRESENT REASONS TO NOTE THIS CRIME RESPONDS TO A CUT OF THE SEXUAL FREEDOM OF CITIZENS, RATHER THAN ITS PROTECTION. FINALLY, WE IDENTIFY TWO PROBLEMS OF THE LEGAL DOGMATIC IN THE STRUCTURE OF IMPUTATION OF THIS CRIME WHICH ARE ADDED UP TO THE CRITICAL REASONS.
258	ONE OF THE MOST OBSERVABLE ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN INDONESIA AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOEHARTO'S NEW ORDER IS THE FLOURISHING FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. ONE NOTABLE CASE WAS THE INDONESIAN PLAYBOY MAGAZINE AND COURT DECISIONS PERTAINING TO IT, WHICH WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DRAWING MASSIVE PUBLIC AND EVEN INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION. BY THOROUGHLY DESCRIBING THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, VALUES, AND BELIEFS OF VARIOUS ACTORS INVOLVED, THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE IMPACTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY EXPERIMENTATION IN INDONESIA AFTER THE AMENDMENT OF 1945 CONSTITUTION. THIS CASE HAS PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY IN OBSERVING THE RULE OF LAW IN ENFORCING THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN INDONESIA FACING SOCIAL CULTURAL ELEMENTS STRONGLY ADHERED TO BY INDONESIAN PEOPLE.
259	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE IMPLICATIONS OF WEAK INSTITUTIONS ON AGRIBUSINESS INVESTMENT IN ARGENTINA. WEAK INSTITUTIONS LEAD TO POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT GROUNDED IN THE MOMENT, RATHER THAN BASED ON PRECEDENT AND DELIBERATIVE PROCESSES OVER TIME. POLITICAL EXIGENCIES AND ELECTION CYCLES CHALLENGE POLICYMAKERS TO YIELD TO LEGAL PRECEDENT, RULE OF LAW, INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF WEAK INSTITUTIONS. WE SUGGEST, AND WELCOME CRITIQUE, THAT THE WEAK INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN ARGENTINA ALLOWS FOR CAPRICIOUS TAX, TRADE, PRICING, AND INVESTMENT POLICIES BY GOVERNMENT TO THE POINT OF CREATING UNDO BUSINESS UNCERTAINTY. THIS UNCERTAINTY RESULTS IN AN INFERIOR AGRIBUSINESS INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IN TURN REDUCES THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACT A ROBUST AGRIBUSINESS COMPLEX COULD PROVIDE TO THE NATION.
260	IN THIS ARTICLE, I ANALYZE EMULATIONS OF STATE LEGAL CULTURE IN LOCAL LABOR AND LAND TENURE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG BUGIS MIGRANTS IN EAST KALIMANTAN, INDONESIA, TO CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS OF A WORLD BANK REPORT ON NONSTATE JUSTICE IN INDONESIA. I FOCUS, IN PARTICULAR, ON HOW AND WHY NONSTATE ACTORS EMULATE ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNMENTALITY OF THE STATE TO CONSTRUCT A NEW REALM OF PARTICIPATION IN THE REGION AND THE STATE AS WELL AS OF RIGHTS AND CITIZENSHIP. IN CONTRAST TO CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE WORLD BANK, I FIND THAT THIS TENDENCY MAY INCREASE RATHER THAN REDUCE LEGAL PLURALISM AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THOSE INVOLVED ACKNOWLEDGE THE STATE'S IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW.
261	EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY AIMS TO SPREAD DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW TO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S NEIGHBOURS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, IT RESPONDS TO EXTERNAL SECURITY THREATS ALONG EU BORDERS. WITH THAT, THE ENP COMBINES THE NORMATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF ENLARGEMENT POLICY WITH A STRATEGIC FOREIGN POLICY AGENDA. THIS IS REVEALED IN EU ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY AS WELL. IN THE PROCESS, THE EU RUNS THE RISK THAT ITS SECURITY POLICY GOALS WILL RUN COUNTER TO THE GOALS OF THE ENP STATES. IN ADDITION, THE ENP'S APPROACH, WHICH IS TAILORED TO THE STATES OF THE 2004 ROUND OF ENLARGEMENT, MISSES THE MARK WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROBLEMS OF COUNTRIES SUCH AS GEORGIA, WHICH FIND THEMSELVES IN THE PHASE OF STATE BUILDING.
262	THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS POORLY DEVELOPED IN THE IMPERIAL ERA AND REMAINED SO IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC UNTIL THE PROCESS OF REFORM BEGAN IN THE 1980S. THE AUTHORITIES NOW RECOGNIZE THAT A MARKET ECONOMY REQUIRES THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY IMPORT IN PARTICULAR NEED FIRM LEGAL FOUNDATIONS. SIGNIFICANT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT TECHNOLOGY AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TO SUPPORT TECHNOLOGY IMPORT. NEVERTHELESS, AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INSTITUTION-BUILDING WILL BE NEEDED BEFORE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK CAN BE REGARDED AS SATISFACTORY. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORITIES' DESIRE TO CONTROL TECHNOLOGY IMPORT THROUGH REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH THE COUNTRY ACQUIRES THE KNOW-HOW WHICH IT NEEDS.
263	POSITIVE LAW DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE, AMONG THE PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONING LAW, THAT OF CONTRADICTION, WHICH IS INHERENT TO THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE AND IS INTEGRATED INTO THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW; OR THE IMMEDIACY, WHICH IS AGAIN CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE FAITHFUL AND EXACT ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE. IN THIS STUDY WE ANALYZE WHETHER THE IMMEDIACY, CONCEIVED AS THE INSTRUCTOR'S PERSONAL AND DIRECT CONTACT WITH AN ACCUSED OR A WITNESS, IS FULFILLED WITH FULL SATISFACTION WHEN THE TEST IS CARRIED OUT DIGITALLY, THAT IS, BY VIDEOCONFERENCE; OR IF, ON THE CONTRARY, THE INSTRUCTOR CEASES TO PERCEIVE GESTURES AND FEATURES THAT WOULD ALLOW A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE TEST.
264	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE CONTENTS OF SOME REPORTS FROM A GROUP OF PROFESSORS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO THINK ON THE FORMATION OF THE LAW PROFESSOR, UNDER THE IDEAS OF COMPLEXITY AND TRANSDISCIPLINARY. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM IDENTIFIES THE CONSTITUENT POLES OF THE TEACHING ACTIVITY THAT BRING THE COMPLEXITY UNDERLYING THE FORMING ACTION. IT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF INEQUALITY AND DEVELOPMENT, GIVEN THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF OPPORTUNITY REFLECTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOCIETY BASED ON A RULE OF LAW. IT ADDRESSES THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE RESEARCH ACTIVITY FOCUSED ON A REFLEXIVE PRACTICE, BASED ON THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY EPISTEMOLOGY AND THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSFORMATION OF THE SUBJECTS OF THE DISCUSSION GROUP.
265	SINCE THE 1970S, CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS MADE USE OF THE CONCEPT OF 'INFRA-LAW TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A CERTAIN SET OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. THESE PRACTICES ARE CHARACTERISED BY A WIDE USE OF REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EASILY TAKEN AWAY FROM PUBLIC AND SOMETIMES EVEN LEGAL CONTROL. THEY ALLOW, THEREFORE, THE REGULATION OF SPECIFIC MATTERS, AS WELL AS THE CONDITION OF PARTICULAR SUBJECTS, IN WAYS THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPLICIT PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, WITHOUT THESE PRINCIPLES HAVING TO BE CALLED INTO QUESTION. IN THIS ESSAY I WILL TRY TO DELINEATE THE THEORETICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CONCEPT OF INFRA-LAW IS MORE CLEARLY SHOWN AND ITS LIMITS AND POTENTIALITIES BECOME COMPREHENSIBLE.
266	THE ARTICLE IS DEDICATED TO THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE US, EU AND RUSSIA APPROACHES TO THE STATE REGULATION OF THE INFORMATION POLICY. THE AUTHORS' MAIN AIM IS TO STUDY THE EVOLUTION OF SUCH NOTIONS AS NET NEUTRALITY, CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION AND THE INFORMATION SECURITY STRATEGY. IN THE NEW INFORMATION AGE, INFORMATION IS THE MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE FOR INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE. THIS REQUIRES DIFFERENT NORMS OF POLITICAL REGULATION. AT THE SAME TIME, POLITICAL SYSTEMS OF WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE MORE FLEXIBLE IN RESPONDING TO THOSE CHALLENGES. THE EU AND THE US MAINTAIN STRONG POLITICAL TRADITIONS OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY. SUCH CHALLENGES LEAD TO A DIFFERENT OUTCOME IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.
267	BASED ON A RARE SURVEY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PRACTITIONERS FROM ONE LARGE COASTAL PROVINCE IN CHINA, THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN APPLICATION OF BOURDIEUSIAN SOCIOLOGY OF JURIDICAL PRACTICE IN CHINESE CRIMINAL COURTS. WE TEST WHETHER AND HOW CRIMINAL TRIAL OUTCOMES CAN BE PREDICTED BY USING VARIABLES MEASURING VARIOUS FORMS OF BOURDIEUSIAN CAPITAL. WE FOUND THAT MEASUREMENTS BASED ON SELF-REPORTED EFFICACY OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION PRACTICES DURING THE PRETRIAL AND TRAIL STAGES (AS ACTIVATED JUDICIAL CAPITAL), MORE SO THAN THOSE INDICATING RESPONDENTS' PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL STATUSES (EITHER INHERITED OR ACQUIRED CAPITAL), YIELD GREATER AND MORE CONSISTENT IMPACT ON THE TRIAL OUTCOMES. IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE THEORY, METHODOLOGY AND CHINESE RULE OF LAW REFORM ARE DISCUSSED.
268	P>THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF THE LINKS BETWEEN POOR GOVERNANCE, WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND THE GROWTH OF PER CAPITA INCOME IN THE COUNTRIES THAT BELONG TO THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS). WE ESTIMATE A CONDITIONAL BETA-CONVERGENCE MODEL USING PANEL DATA. WE FIND THAT VARIABLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE REGULATORY BURDEN, POLITICAL VIOLENCE, AND GOVERNMENT INEFFECTIVENESS HINDER GROWTH IN THESE COUNTRIES. AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS THEN THE FOLLOWING: WHAT CAN THE COUNTRIES DO TO IMPROVE THEIR SITUATIONS? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE GIVE SEVERAL EXAMPLES (GHANA, NIGERIA AND THE NEPAD) OF MEASURES THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE INSTITUTIONS AND IMPROVE GOVERNANCE.
269	NEOLIBERALISM AND NEOCONSERVATISM ARE TWO DISTINCT POLITICAL RATIONALITIES IN THE CONTEMPORARY UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE FEW OVERLAPPING FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND EVEN APPEAR CONTRADICTORY IN MANY RESPECTS. YET THEY CONVERGE NOT ONLY IN THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO IN THEIR DE-DEMOCRATIZING EFFECTS. THEIR RESPECTIVE DEVALUATION OF POLITICAL LIBERTY, EQUALITY, SUBSTANTIVE CITIZENSHIP, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN FAVOR OF GOVERNANCE ACCORDING TO MARKET CRITERIA ON THE ONE SIDE, AND VALORIZATION OF STATE POWER FOR PUTATIVELY MORAL ENDS ON THE OTHER, UNDERMINES BOTH THE CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. ABOVE ALL, THE TWO RATIONALITIES WORK SYMBIOTICALLY TO PRODUCE A SUBJECT RELATIVELY INDIFFERENT TO VERACITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT AND TO POLITICAL FREEDOM AND EQUALITY AMONG THE CITIZENRY.
270	IF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURTS ARE TO ACHIEVE THEIR AIMS-ONE OF WHICH IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE TRIUMPH OF THE RULE OF LAW OVER THE INSTINCT FOR REVENGE AFTER PROLONGED PERIODS OF COMMUNAL VIOLENCE-PERCEPTION OF THEIR LEGITIMACY BY THE LOCAL POPULATION IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR. AFTER LAYING OUT AND COMPARING THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND THE SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE AS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ORIGINS, OBJECTIVES, AND PROGRAMS OF OUTREACH, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES LOCAL RECEPTION FROM THREE STANDPOINTS: PERCEPTIONS OF OVERALL LEGITIMACY, PERCEPTIONS OF TRIBUNAL IMPARTIALITY, AND THE EFFECT OF PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE TRIBUNALS ON THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES' RECONCILIATION PROCESS.
271	THE AUTHOR STUDIES IN THE PUBLICATION THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGY IN CRIMINAL LAW IN SOVIET RUSSIA. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THIS STAGE, EXPRESSED IN THE COMPLETE DENIAL OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGY OBTAINED AT EARLIER STAGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN STATE AND ABROAD; IT DETERMINES THAT THE TECHNIQUES OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGY ARE OVERLOADED WITH AN IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL COMPONENT; IT CONCLUDES THAT THE MAIN IDEA OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL LAW IS CONCENTRATED ON THE LEGAL AND TECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE DENYING ITS PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
272	THE STRENGTH OF STATES HAS LONG BEEN REGARDED BY THE SPECIALIZED LITERATURE AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO GUARANTEE THE VIABILITY OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PHENOMENA SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION, THE RULE OF LAW, ADEQUATE PROVISION OF BASIC PUBLIC GOODS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE STRENGTH, ONLY FEW SCHOLARLY WORKS HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORED THE DEFINITION AND THE CONSTITUTIVE DIMENSIONS OF THIS CONCEPT. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO (A) REFINE THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF STATE STRENGTH, (B) INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT RULES OF AGGREGATION FOR ACHIEVING DIFFERENTIATION AMONG EMPIRICAL CASES (I.E., COUNTRIES), AND (C) PROVIDE CONCEPTUAL TOOLS TO HELP ANALYSTS MOVE BEYOND THE CLASSICAL DICHOTOMY OF STRONG STATES VERSUS WEAK STATES.
273	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS THAT ARE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS IN AFRICA. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IT USED THE TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES (2SLS) AND DATA OF THE WORLD BANK (WDI AND WGI) FOR THE PERIOD 1992-2016. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MOST INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY NATURAL RESOURCES RENTS ARE BY ORDER: CORRUPTION; PROBLEM OF RULE OF LAW OR JUSTICE; INEFFICIENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS; BAD REGULATION; LACK OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; POLITICAL INSTABILITY. NATURAL RESOURCES RENTS ALSO CAUSE VOLATILITY OF GDP PER CAPITA, LEADING TO LOW LEVEL OF PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL ACCUMULATION. FOR THESE REASONS, AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHOULD PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DIVERSIFY THEIR ECONOMIES.
274	THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF CHILEAN ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THIS CAUSES AN UNEQUAL TREATMENT IN THE ACCESS OF JUSTICE THAT AFFECTS THE CORRECT FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN FACT, THERE IS NO GENERAL MECHANISM FOR RESOLVING LITIGATION IN WHICH THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS A PARTY OR WHEN MATTERS REGULATED BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE AT DEBATE. ON THE CONTRARY, THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS HAVE LIMITED JURISDICTIONAL FUNCTIONS, JUSTIFIED BY REASONS OF SPECIALTY. IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS FOR A COHERENT ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT ENCOMPASSES A FULL AND EQUAL JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.
275	THE PROCEDURAL ACTION THEORY, IN ITS ABSTRACT SENSE, CAN BE THE BASIS FOR THE CONCEPTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT ONLY UNDER ITS CONCEPTION IS POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT ALL THE RIGHTS-HOLDERS EITHER THEY ARE RIGHT OR WRONG, HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD IN THE PROCESS, ACCORDING TO THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW. THEREFORE, THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IS NO LONGER A THEORETICAL OR FORMALISTIC INSTITUTION BUT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH LEGITIMIZES THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AS A GENUINE INSTRUMENT FOR THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES (HETEROCOMPOSITION), AND IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROSCRIPTION OF CITIZEN'S IDEA OF TAKING JUSTICE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
276	THIS IS A STUDY OF HOW VACUUMS IN STATE SERVICES ATTRACT ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS. CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN KACHIN STATE ENGAGE IN POLICE WORK TO TACKLE DRUG MARKETS IN RESPONSE TO HEAVY PARTICIPATION OF STATE POLICE IN THOSE MARKETS AND LIMITED POLICE INTEREST IN REGULATING THEM. CHURCHES AIM TO INDUCE DEMOCRATISATION OF THE POLICE AND RESPONSIVENESS OF THE POLICE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THEY HAVE ARRESTED POLICE AND HELPED CATALYSE MANY DOZENS OF PROSECUTIONS OF POLICE FOR DRUG OFFENCES OR DRUG-RELATED CORRUPTION IN KACHIN STATE. BAPTIST POLICE IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE USE NONVIOLENT SWARMING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CARRYING ARMS WHEN ARRESTING HEAVILY ARMED DRUG KINGPINS, POLICE AND MILITARY, AND WHEN SEIZING DRUGS.
277	FOLLOWING REMARKS ABOUT THE NATURE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF VALUES AND VALUES EDUCATION, GENERALLY AND MORE SPECIFICALLY IN CHINA, ENGLAND, MEXICO AND SPAIN, WE EXPLAIN THE METHODS USED TO ANALYSE OFFICIAL POLICIES THAT APPLY TO MORAL EDUCATION, CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION AND CHARACTER EDUCATION. WE FIND SIMILARITY ACROSS THE DOCUMENTS REGARDING FIVE VALUES-RELATED THEMES: JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW; HARMONY AND TOLERANCE; DIVERSITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION; INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING; AND EQUALITY. THESE THEMES EMPHASISE UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWING, WITH LIMITED CONSIDERATION OF IMPLEMENTATION AND PRIVILEGING OF DOMINANT VALUES AND CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT ACROSS COUNTRIES THERE ARE ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS AND THAT FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED ON HOW THESE DOCUMENTS ARE INTERPRETED IN PRACTICE BY EDUCATORS.
278	ARTICLE 51 OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION SETS FORTH THE RETURN OF ASSETS DIVERTED THROUGH CORRUPTION AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE CONVENTION. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE STATE WHERE THE STOLEN ASSETS ARE LOCATED IS ENTITLED TO REFUSE THEIR REPATRIATION OR SUBJECT IT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CONVENTION AND THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND IT AND ARGUES THAT SUCH A STATE HAS A WIDER DISCRETION OVER THE RETURN OF STOLEN ASSETS THAN IS OFTEN THOUGHT. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW MAY BE BETTER SERVED IF STATES TAKE VIGOROUS ACTION TO CONFISCATE THE PROCEEDS OF CORRUPTION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE ULTIMATELY REPATRIATED.
279	ONCE REGARDED AS MERE PAWNS OF THEIR REGIMES, COURTS IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES ARE NOW THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WITHIN THE FIELD OF COMPARATIVE JUDICIAL POLITICS. NEW RESEARCH EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH LAW AND COURTS ARE DEPLOYED AS INSTRUMENTS OF GOVERNANCE, HOW THEY STRUCTURE STATE-SOCIETY CONTENTION, AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH COURTS ARE TRANSFORMED INTO SITES OF ACTIVE RESISTANCE. THIS NEW BODY OF RESEARCH CONSTITUTES AN EMERGENT FIELD OF INQUIRY, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTRIBUTING TO A NUMBER OF RELATED RESEARCH AGENDAS, INCLUDING AUTHORITARIAN DURABILITY AND REGIME TRANSITION, HUMAN RIGHTS, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, LAW AND DEVELOPMENT, AND RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION. MOREOVER, THIS RESEARCH OFFERS IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE EROSION OF RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES IN "CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES."
280	MARXISTS SHOULD RECONSIDER THEIR USUAL ATTITUDE TO UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS. ON THE JEWISH QUESTION DID NOT REJECT THE ENTIRE FRENCH DECLARATION OF 1791. IN 1843 MARX AND ENGELS WERE CLOSE TO BABOUVISM, THE CONTINUATION OF FRENCH RIGHTS. NOR WAS THEIR VIEW THAT THE 1791 DECLARATION MUST BE COMPLETED BY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS; RATHER, THEIR CRITICISM CONCERNED THE REDUCTION OF UNIVERSAL RIGHTS TO CITIZEN RIGHTS BECAUSE IT LEFT THE STATE THE FINAL ARBITER OF JUSTICE, DENYING THE 'VOICE FROM BELOW'. THE SOURCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS CANNOT BE THE STATE OR ITS HEGEMONIC RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT A POLITICS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WOULD RETURN JUSTICE TO INDIVIDUALS AND CREATE A COUNTER-HEGEMONY.
281	THIS ESSAY AIMS TO OFFER A GUSTAV RADBRUCH'S PORTRAIT FOCUSING ON THE FIGURE OF THE JUDGE. THROUGH A PATH OF READINGS THAT TOUCHES DIFFERENT MOMENTS OF HIS THOUGHT, THE BASIC INTENT IS TO SHOW HOW THE IMAGE OF THE JUDGE, OF HIS ACTIVITY, OF HIS PRACTICAL WISDOM, OF HIS PERSONAL VIRTUES, DO NOT CHANGE OVER THE YEARS AND ASSUME AN INCREASING IMPORTANCE FOR THE IDEAL OF JUSTICE. RADBRUCH'S RULE OF LAW IDEA WAS DEFENDED UNTIL THE COLLAPSE OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC, THAT IS FOR HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE ROLE OF JUDGES ACTS AS AN ALLY OF JUSTICE PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY COMPETENT AND HONEST, BUT ALSO COURAGEOUS JURISTS.
282	THIS PAPER IS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN COMPARATIVE POLICE IDEOLOGY. IT DESCRIBES CULTURAL QUALITIES THAT DISTINGUISH TAIWAN'S IDEA OF DEMOCRATIC POLICING FROM COMPARABLE IDEAS IN OTHER PLACES. I EXAMINE THE HISTORICAL PROCESS BY WHICH TAIWAN'S POLICE CAME TO BE ORGANIZED AROUND THE POPULATION REGISTRY (THE HUKOU). THIS PROCESS HAS INSTITUTIONALIZED A CONFUCIAN UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIC VIRTUE AS AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE IN TAIWANESE POLICING. BASED ON THESE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL OBSERVATIONS, I FORMULATE AN IDEAL TYPICAL MODEL OF TAIWANESE "POLICING THROUGH VIRTUE" THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO OTHER STEREOTYPICAL NATIONAL POLICING STYLES SUCH AS BRITAIN'S "POLICING BY CONSENT," AMERICA'S DISCRETIONARY POLICING, AND FRANCE'S FORMALIST EMPHASIS ON DIVISION OF POWER AND RULE OF LAW.
283	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORY OF CERTIORARI AND JUDICIAL REVIEW AS IT PERTAINS TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE OPENS WITH A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF THE CONVICTION OF NAT BELL LIQUORS LTD. DURING PROHIBITION-ERA EDMONTON IN 1920, AND EXPLAINS HOW TWELVE BOTTLES OF WHISKEY BROUGHT ABOUT A SEA CHANGE IN THE FOUNDATIONAL LAW OF CANADA. THE ARTICLE DETAILS THE DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, BEGINNING IN THIRTEENTH CENTURY UNITED KINGDOM, NOTING ITS PROGRESSION AND CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF CENTURIES. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF CERTIORARI AS A REPLACEMENT AVENUE WHERE APPEAL IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND HIGHLIGHTS NOTABLE CANADIAN JURISPRUDENCE FROM THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT DAY.
284	THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAS NEVER BEEN JUST AN ADMINICULAR MECHANISM OF THE HEAD OF STATE. UNLIKE ITS WESTERN ANALOGS, IT HAS ALWAYS POSSESSED AN INCOMPARABLY LARGE RESOURCE OF POWER. WHILE PRESIDENTS WERE CHANGED, THE PERSONAL STUFF, STRUCTURE AND AUTHORITIES OF THIS BODY WERE ALSO CHANGED, BUT ITS CENTRAL PLACE IN THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN STATE REMAINED STABLE. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS AN INSTITUTION, WHOSE LEGAL STATUS DOES NOT HAVE A CLEAR LEGAL SHAPE. NOT WITHOUT REASON THE JOURNALISTS, AS WELL AS LAWYERS, POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND HISTORIANS SOMETIMES CALL IT THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT OR THE SECRET ORDER. HOWEVER, THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS NOT QUITE CLEAR. EVEN THE NAME "ADMINISTRATION" IS OFTEN MISLEADING: WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION MAY BE CONSIDERED THE EXECUTIVE POWER OR THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN A WIDER SENSE? THIS AND OTHER DISPUTES ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND ITS LEGAL STATUS HAVE ARISEN IN THE EXPERT COMMUNITY WITH THE BEGINNING OF COMPLEX WORK ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT, AND ARE STILL ONGOING TODAY. IN THIS REGARD, THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE DECIDED TO MAKE ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS IN THE COUNTRY TO INVESTIGATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION REALLY IS, WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FUNCTIONING, AND WHETHER THERE ARE LEGAL MEANS TO RESOLVE THEM AT THE PRESENT STAGE. TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THE AUTHOR THOROUGHLY ANALYZES THE MODELS AND ARGUMENTS PROPOSED AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW RUSSIA, AND CORRELATES THEM WITH THE BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES.
285	WE DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HOW LEGISLATORS FROM DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES MAKE SENSE OF THEIR AMBITIONS AND EXPERIENCES IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASYLUM POLICY. IN THIS STUDY WE WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS CAN CREATE CONDITIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. THE CURRENT STUDY THEREFORE EXPLORED HOW THE SWEDISH 2005 ALIENS ACT AND THE NEW SYSTEM FOR APPEALS AND PROCEDURES (NSAP) WERE NEGOTIATED AND PERCEIVED BY 15 LEGISLATORS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL INSURANCE (COSI) THAT CONSIDERED THIS LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE SINCE 2006. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE OPENLY INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF NEGOTIATING MIGRATION POLICY VIA THEIR COMMITTEE WORK. THE STUDY IS INSPIRED BY INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (IPA) AS IT CAN REACH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS' ATTEMPT TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE. FIRST, THE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND THEN INDEPENDENTLY CODED BY THE FIRST TWO AUTHORS. THEREAFTER, THEY COLLABORATIVELY REFINED THE THEMES AND SUB-THEMES AND DISCUSSED THEM WITH THE THIRD AUTHOR. THE OVERALL FINDING IS THAT THE PRECEDING POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS CAN BE ONE OF THE REASONS FOR UNCLEAR AIMS WHEN POLITICIANS' PROPOSE NEW LEGISLATION. THIS IS BECAUSE DIRECTIVES CAN CONSIST OF MANY DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES AND CONSIDERATIONS. THE SPECIFIC FINDINGS ARE THAT THE PERIOD UNDER CONSIDERATION WAS DESCRIBED AS DRAMATIC AND STRESSFUL WITH THE PRESENCE OF UNCOMMON POLITICAL COLLABORATION BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES AS WELL AS THE PUSHING OF LEGISLATION VIA BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE PARTICIPANTS SAID THAT THE SUGGESTED CHANGES IN ASYLUM POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION WERE MAINLY BASED ON OTHER POLICY ASPECTS, SUCH AS FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS AND STATE-MUNICIPALITY RELATIONS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO VIEWED THAT IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS WITH ASYLUM DECISION-MAKING HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY RESOLVED BY THE NEW FRAMEWORK. EVEN THOUGH THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN SWEDEN, ITS FINDINGS CAN BE RELEVANT TO OTHER POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS THESE STATES CAN ALSO STRUGGLE WITH CONTRADICTORY AIMS WITH ASYLUM POLICY.
286	SINCE THE 15 JULY 2016 FAILED COUP, TURKEY HAS SEEN THE MASS ARRESTS AND DETENTION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS; AMONG THEM ARE JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS, MILITARY PERSONNEL, POLICE OFFICERS, JOURNALISTS, LAWYERS, HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS AND OPPOSITION POLITICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIBERTY ON AN ARRAY OF TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES. WHILE THIS HAS RAISED NUMEROUS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THOSE RELATING TO PRE-TRIAL RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS DURING THE POST-COUP STATE OF EMERGENCY. BUILDING ON THE THEORY AND USE OF THE REASONABLENESS CONCEPT IN THE FIELD OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION THROUGH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE 'REASONABLE SUSPICION' TEST UNDER ARTICLE 5 1 (C) OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR OR THE CONVENTION), THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (THE COURT OR THE ECTHR) IN ENFORCING THE GUARANTEES OF THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY IN THE TURKISH POST-COUP CASES OF MEHMET HASAN ALTAN, SAHIN ALPAY, ALPARSLAN ALTAN AND KAVALA. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF PRE-EXISTING CONVENTION STANDARDS ON PRE-TRIAL REASONABLE SUSPICION IN STATES OF EMERGENCY, IT FINDS THAT THE ECTHR HAS ADOPTED A STRONGER SUPERVISORY STANCE REGARDING THE COMPATIBILITY OF TURKISH POST-COUP DETENTION PRACTICES THAN THE MORE HESITANT APPROACH SHOWN IN THE PRIOR DEROGATION CONTEXT OF NORTHERN IRELAND. WHILE THESE DECISIONS GIVE SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM IN THE HOPE FOR A JUDICIAL BOLDNESS ON THE PART OF THE ECTHR IN CONDEMNING TURKEY'S ARBITRARY DETENTION PRACTICES DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE IS FURTHER SCOPE FOR THE COURT TO STRENGTHEN ITS PROTECTION IN THIS RESPECT. NOTABLY, DESPITE THE POSITIVE ASPECTS IN THE COURT'S APPROACH, BY CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THE TURKISH LEGAL LANDSCAPE IS CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING ARTICLE 5 VIOLATIONS AND NOT TACKLING THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL ISSUES SO CLEARLY AT PLAY, THE COURT LEAVES A GLARING GAP IN RIGHTS PROTECTION FOR THOSE SEEKING JUSTICE.
287	HISTORIC PRESERVATION AND HERITAGE CONSERVATION ARE TWO MAINSTREAM CONCEPTS RELATED TO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND RENEWAL OF HISTORIC HOUSES. WITH THE AIM OF ENHANCING THE SUS-TAINABILITY OF HISTORIC HOUSES, THIS ARTICLE CRITICIZES THE VIEW OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION THAT INSISTS ON PRESERVING HISTORIC HOUSES WITH THEIR OLD APPEARANCES, WHICH DOES NOT FULLY DEVELOP THEIR SUSTAINABILITY. IN CONTRAST, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE VIEW OF HERITAGE CONSERVATION THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HISTORIC HOUSES AND RELATED LEGISLATION. IN THE SECOND AND THIRD PARTS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE THEORETICAL ORIGIN OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION, WHICH EM-PHASIZES AND SUMMARIZES THE ONE-WAY PROTECTION OF CULTURAL MEMORY VIA HISTORIC HOUSES. IN THE FOURTH PART, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO HERITAGE CONSERVATION, HIGHLIGHTS THE SUSTAINABLE CYCLE BE-TWEEN HISTORIC HOUSES AND CULTURAL MEMORY, AND UNDERLINES THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS SUSTAINABLE CYCLE. IN THE FIFTH PART, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH TO HERITAGE CONSERVATION AND RELATED LEGAL SAFEGUARDS BY TAKING THE RENEWAL OF HISTORIC HOUSES IN CHINA'S BAGUA VILLAGE (OR "EIGHT DIAGRAMS VILLAGE") AS AN EXAMPLE. IN THE LAST PART, THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE THEO-RETICAL VALUE, PRACTICAL VALUE AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS ARTICLE. THE FINDINGS CAN FACILITATE THE UN'S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INCLUSION, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO PROMOTE THE HERITAGE LEGISLATION AND POLICY OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.(C) 2022 HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS LIMITED COMPANY.

288	NATIONAL SPORTS ARE HIGHLY VALUED THROUGHOUT ASIA, YET, POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS IMPEDE THE EXPANSION OF THE SPORT SYSTEM LANDSCAPE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ON ASIAN SPORTING PERFORMANCE. TO ACCOMPLISH SO, WE ANALYZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY LAW, AND NATIONAL SPORTS PERFORMANCE FROM 1998 TO 2018 WHILE CONTROLLING FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE ESTIMATORS WERE UTILIZED TO EXAMINE THE DATA. NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN POLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND NATIONAL SPORTS PERFORMANCE IN THE ASIAN COUNTRIES UNDER EXAMINATION, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY'S FINDINGS. THE PAPER INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND POLICYMAKERS.
289	THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS IN DEEP TROUBLE. THE POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE US, ALONG WITH ITS UNDERPINNING MORAL FABRIC, HAS BEEN CRUMBLING FOR SOME TIME AND IS NOW ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. IF IT DOES NOT RESTRUCTURE AND REVAMP ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM WITH TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL ETHICS, AND RULE OF LAW, THE US WILL BE BELEAGUERED BY DOMESTIC TURMOIL AND BE THRUSTED INTO A DARKER HOLE VIS-A-VIS RISING POWERS SUCH AS CHINA. IF THE US FAILS, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL FAIL. WHILE DELVING INTO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT PLAGUE AMERICA'S SOCIETAL VALUES AND POLITICAL FOUNDATION, THIS ARTICLE, THE FIRST OF A TWO-PART ARTICLE, SUGGESTS WAYS THE US CAN REDEEM ITS STATUS AS A MORAL AUTHORITY ON THE GLOBAL STAGE.
290	THERE IS NOW A GLOBAL ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERNACULAR OF GOVERNANCE AND ITS INSTRUMENTS. STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, PRACTITIONERS AND CONFEREES ALIKE IN BEIJING, WASHINGTON AND NUMEROUS OTHER LOCATIONS USE TERMS AND PHRASES LIKE "GOVERNANCE," "POLICY INSTRUMENTS," "NGOS" AND "THE RULE OF LAW" WHEN TALKING ABOUT AND ANALYSING GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS. BUT DO THESE WORDS HAVE THE SAME MEANING IN DIFFERENT HEADS? IN RESPONSE, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME KEY VERNACULAR TERMS RELATED TO GOVERNANCE AND INSTRUMENTS, AND COMPARES THEIR PRACTICAL MEANING IN CHINA AND THE US TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE VERNACULAR IS ROBUST ENOUGH TO PERMIT DEEP COMPARISONS BETWEEN DIFFERING "OPERATING SYSTEMS." IT CONTENDS THAT, AT PRESENT, IT IS NOT, BUT THAT PATIENT ATTENTION TO DIFFERING SYSTEMS MAY YIELD CLUES TO TRANSLATION AND, ULTIMATELY, FRUITFUL COMPARISONS.
291	THE BRAZILIAN TAX LEVIED ON THE CONSUMPTION MATRIX HAS BEEN POORLY UNDERSTOOD, NOT ONLY BY THOSE SUFFERING SUCH AN IMPACT, BUT ALSO BY THE COMMON LAW UNDER THE HIGHER COURTS. SEVERAL CONCEPTUAL MISINTERPRETATIONS HAVE BEEN VERIFIED CONCERNING THE ELEMENTS OF THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP INVOLVING THE TAXATION ON CONSUMPTION. THE CONCENTRATION OF TAXATION ON CONSUMPTION PROMPTS TO LOW-INCOME CITIZENS TO HAVE A GREATER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME, DEDUCTED BY THE PAYMENT OF TAXES EMBEDDED IN GOODS PRICES. INSOFAR AS THE NATIONAL TAX BURDEN DEDUCTS MORE TAXES FROM THE POOR, THERE IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF EQUALITY, CONTRIBUTORY ABILITY AND PERSONHOOD OF TAXATION, WHICH REPRESENT THE DEMOCRATIC BIAS THAT MUST EXIST IN THE REVENUE INFLOW DERIVED THROUGH A RULE OF LAW.
292	THIS PAPER ANALYZES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH A CO-EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS WHERE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS LINKED TO THE RULE OF LAW ARE TRANSFORMED JOINTLY,WITH CULTURAL VALUES. THIS TYPE OF DYNAMIC MAKES POSSIBLE TO ATTAIN MULTIPLE EQUILIBRIUMS AND, HENCE, ECONOMIC BACKWARDNESS IS EXPLAINED BY THE PRESENCE OF AN "OPPORTUNISTIC" CULTURE THAT COEXISTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ILLEGALITY PREVAILS. BY MEANS OF AN EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY MODEL, IT IS SHOWN THAT A LOW INCOME PER-CAPITA SCENARIO IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ERADICATE. THIS IS THE CASE BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A CULTURAL INERTIA GENERATED BY THE CO-EVOLUTION ITSELF, AND BECAUSE OF THE RELEVANCE THAT REMOTE FACTORS (SOCIOCULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL) HAVE ON DETERMINING THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ECONOMY CAN MOVE FOLLOWING CERTAIN GROWTH PATH.
293	THE INTENSIFIED USE OF CULTIVATED LAND IS ESSENTIAL FOR OPTIMIZING CROP PLANTING PRACTICES AND PROTECTING FOOD SECURITY. THIS STUDY EMPLOYED A TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE THE CULTIVATED LAND USE INTENSIFICATION RATES IN TYPICAL CHINESE VILLAGES (VILLAGE CULTIVATED LAND USE INTENSIFICATIONS-VCLUIS). THE PRESSURE-STATE-RESPONSE (PSR) MODEL ORGANIZES THE VCLUI INDEXES INCLUDING THE INTENSITY PRESS, OUTPUT STATE, AND STRUCTURAL RESPONSE OF CULTIVATED LAND USE. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN BAIQUAN COUNTY, CHINA, INDICATING THAT THE CULTIVATED LAND USE INTENSIFICATION LEVELS OF THE WHOLE COUNTY WERE LOW. HOWEVER, THE INTENSIFICATIONS OF VILLAGES INFLUENCED BY PHYSICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AND SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEVELS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS PAPER ALSO FOUND THAT VARIATIONS IN THE VCLUIS WERE MAINLY DEPENDENT ON NEW LABOR-DRIVEN SOCIAL SUBSYSTEM DIFFERENCES. THUS, THE EXPANDING PER CAPITA FARMLAND SCALES AND INCREASING NUMBERS OF NEW AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS ENTITIES WERE CRITICAL IN IMPROVING THE VCLUI. OVERALL, THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ANALYZING INTERACTIONS AMONG THE NATURAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC SUBSYSTEMS OF THE VCLUI. THE FINDINGS OBTAINED IN THIS STUDY POTENTIALLY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE REGIONAL FOOD SECURITY, NATURAL STABILITY, AND AGRICULTURAL LAND USE SUSTAINABILITY.
294	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NOVEL THEORY OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SUITABLE FOR CREATING INSTITUTION-SPECIFIC NORMATIVE STANDARDS IN AUSTRALIA. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONTENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IN AUSTRALIA AND IDENTIFIES PREVIOUSLY RECOGNISED ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE PROPERTIES. IN SO DOING, THIS ARTICLE GIVES CLOSE CONSIDERATION TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE PROPERTIES. IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A NEW THEORY OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IS PROPOSED FROM FOUNDATIONAL RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS THEORY IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT ARRANGES ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE PROPERTIES INTO FOUR THEMES WHICH EMBRACE THE PRINCIPLED TENSIONS THAT ARE EVER-PRESENT WHEN CONSIDERING NORMATIVE STANDARDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE. THE GENERALISED THEORY OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE PRESENTED HERE IS SUITED TO AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE AND IS TAILORABLE TO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE SETTINGS.
295	THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS FOR A SAMPLE OF 130 COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT LESS-CORRUPT COUNTRIES HAVE BETTER QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE, BETTER QUALITY IN THE FORMULATION AND ADOPTION OF POLICIES AND GREATER CREDIBILITY AND GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO SUCH POLICIES. THE FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS HIGHER IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, THE ESTIMATES ALSO REVEAL THAT COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST INDEBTED GOVERNMENTS AND WITH HIGHER INFLATION RATES HAVE LESS-EFFICIENT GOVERNMENTS, AND AN INCREASE IN RULE OF LAW REPRESENTS A GOOD STRATEGY TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. IN TURN, REGARDING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT COUNTRIES WITH MORE DEMOCRATIC REGIMES HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS.
296	THE PRACTICE OF FAMILY SOLIDARITY IS A FACT IN AFRICAN SOCIETIES EVEN IF THE PEOPLE ARE FACING ALL KINDS OF RISKS FROM AN EARLY AGE, BEFORE THEY EXERT THEIR ACTIVITY TO TAKE CHARGE. THERE IS LACK OF CIVIL PROTECTIONS AS "SOCIAL SECURITY" WHICH COVERS INDIVIDUALS FROM ILLNESS AND OTHER RISKS THUS TRANSFORMING AFRICAN SOCIETIES INTO SCENES WHERE VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL INSECURITY REIGNS. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS IN QUESTION AS WELL AS THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RISKS TO LIFE, WORK, EDUCATION, HEALTH, OTHER ENVIRONMENT. THE SOCIAL ROLE TO BE PLAYED BY THE RULE OF LAW IS ALSO IN QUESTION. BUT THE BOND OF SOLIDARITY IS PRIMARILY ETHICAL. IT BINDS ONE HUMAN TO ANOTHER, BEYOND THE LAWS AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
297	MORAL EDUCATION IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS DOMINATED BY IDEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE LAST 30 YEARS CHINA HAS EXPERIENCED EXTENSIVE ECONOMIC REFORM, BRINGING ABOUT MANY SOCIAL CHANGES, SUCH AS DECREASING RELIANCE ON THE STATE-OWNED WORKPLACE, INCREASING PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. SUCH CHANGES HAVE INEVITABLY INFLUENCED PERSONAL, SOCIETAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VALUES, AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD AN IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL MORAL BELIEFS AND BEHAVIOUR. IN THIS PAPER I ANALYSE THE DECLINE OF SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY, REVOLUTIONARY MORALITY AND IDEOLOGICAL WORK IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA SO AS TO PROVIDE A BACKGROUND TO CURRENT CHINESE MORAL EDUCATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES. I ILLUMINATE SOME INHERENT CONTRADICTIONS AND AMBIGUITIES IN THE CHANGING IDEOLOGICAL-POLITICAL ORIENTATIONS BY REFERENCE TO SOME PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES.
298	THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CREDITORS' REMEDIES AND THEIR ACTUAL PRACTICABILITY IS A GOOD YARDSTICK FOR PROGRESS TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THIS MEASURE BULGARIA ACHIEVED LITTLE PROGRESS THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE 1990S, BUT THIS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 1997. LEGAL REFORMS WERE ONLY ONE AMONG SEVERAL FACTORS DRIVING THIS PROGRESS; AMONG THE OTHERS WERE MACROECONOMIC STABILISATION, PRIVATISATION, THE DISINTEGRATION OF TRADE UNIONS AND THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF ATTEMPTS TO KEEP MOST OF THE SOCIALIST GIANTS ALIVE. ONLY THE RECOGNITION OF THIS FAILURE FACILITATED SOME CRUCIAL REFORMS; NEVERTHELESS THESE REFORMS HAVE BEEN TOO HALFHEARTED TO PUT CREDITORS' RIGHTS ON A SECURE FOOTING. IN ACTUAL FACT DEBTORS HAVE REMAINED A VERY WELL PROTECTED GROUP.
299	MOST FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS HAVE FALLEN INTO AN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNDER-REFORM TRAP. AN INTRUSIVE STATE IMPOSES HIGH TAX RATES AND DRIVES ENTREPRENEURS INTO THE UNOFFICIAL ECONOMY WHICH FURTHER AGGRAVATES THE PRESSURE ON OFFICIAL BUSINESSMEN. TAX REVENUES AND PUBLIC GOODS DWINDLE, FURTHER REDUCING INCENTIVES TO REGISTER BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THIS ECONOMIC UNDER-REFORM TRAP HAS A POLITICAL COUNTERPART. REMARKABLY, COMMUNIST PARTIES REMAIN POPULAR AND OPPOSED TO ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW PRECISELY IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO DELAY AND DERAIL REFORM. NO ELECTORAL BACKLASH PROMPTS THE REFORMS NECESSARY TO LEAVE THE UNDER-REFORM TRAP. THE BEST WAY OUT OF THE TRAP ILL COUNTRIES SUCH AS RUSSIA AND UKRAINE IS INCREASED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL COMPETITION AMONG THE ELITE.
300	THE HAGUE AND ARUSHA WAR-CRIMES TRIBUNALS HAVE HAD TWO MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS: THEY ADMINISTER 'INTERNATIONAL' JUSTICE, NOT VICTOR'S JUSTICE; AND THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED IN PRACTICE THEIR RIGHT TO INDICT AND TRY INDIVIDUALS DESPITE THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE CRIMES AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS' FORMAL SUBJECTION TO NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTIES. THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE NONETHELESS LIMITED SINCE THEY REST ON AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS WHICH COULD PROVE EPHEMERAL. NEITHER THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL NOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ARE LEGITIMATE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS: THERE IS NO TRUE INSTITUTIONAL EMBODIMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL POPULAR INTEREST. US AND CHINESE OPPOSITION TO PLANS FOR A PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT DOES NOT HELP. ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE 1990S TOWARDS EXTENDING THE RULE OF LAW AND ESTABLISHING JUSTICE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THUS REMAIN INCOMPLETE, CONTESTED AND ULTIMATELY FRAGILE.
301	AS THE WORLD'S LEADING FISH PRODUCER, EXPORTER AND CONSUMER STATE, CHINA MUST ACT DECISIVELY TO ERADICATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE IN WILD-CAPTURE SPECIES DERIVED FROM ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED (IUU) FISHING. IN 2019 CHINA LAUNCHED AN OVERHAUL OF ITS 1986 FISHERIES LAW WITH A DRAFT STATUTE SUBJECT TO THE DELIBERATION OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS. IN THIS POLICY BRIEF, WE ARGUE THAT CHINA SHOULD NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY BUT PROACTIVELY ALIGN WITH THE GLOBAL PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARD RESPONSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. TO AMEND THE PATCHY LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW AHEAD, WE SUGGEST TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED TRACEABILITY AND MARKET-RESPONSIVE SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE COUNTRY MITIGATE ILLICIT CAPTURING, PROCESSING, AND TRANSACTION EVENTS INFILTRATING FROM BAIT TO PLATE.
302	THE NORDIC COUNTRIES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR WELL-FUNCTIONING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS. IN INDICES MEASURING CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, THEY FREQUENTLY OCCUPY TOP POSITIONS. HOWEVER, AS WE DEMONSTRATE IN THIS ARTICLE, A COUNTRY'S TOP POSITION IN COMPARATIVE INDICES DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY IMPLY THAT CITIZENS VIEW THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE SAME WAY AS DEPICTED BY EXPERTS. THE OBSERVATION IS IN NO WAY TRIVIAL: DRAWING ON THEORIES OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, WE GO ON TO SHOW-STATISTICALLY, USING INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DATA-THAT WIDESPREAD PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THE UNFAIRNESS OF CIVIL SERVANTS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM EVEN IN SO-CALLED HIGH-TRUST AND "LEAST CORRUPT" SETTINGS SUCH AS THE NORDIC ONES.
303	THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO ANALYZE THE CONVERGENCES AND DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE THEORETICAL VIEWPOINTS OF HABERMAS AND HONNETH, TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL PHILOSOPHERS OF THE LAST FEW DECADES. FIRSTLY, IT COMPARES THEIR DISTINCT METHODOLOGICAL SUPPOSITIONS, RELATING THEM TO THE CURRENT DEBATE OVER THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN 'MORAL' AND 'ETHICAL' VIEWPOINTS. NEXT, IT EXPLORES THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL STRUGGLES FOR RECOGNITION CAN FORM A THEORETICALLY PRODUCTIVE MEDIUM FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE MODERN WESTERN WORLD. FINALLY IT EXAMINES THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE RULE OF LAW IN MODERN SOCIETIES, LOOKING TO DETERMINE TO WHAT POINT WE CAN ADHERE TO THE HABERMASIAN THEORY OF DISCOURSE AND WHERE THIS CAN BE USEFULLY COMPLEMENTED BY A THEORY OF SOCIAL RECOGNITION.
304	DISSOLUTION OF THE BUNDESTAG BY THE FEDERAL PRESIDENT ON ADVICE OF FEDERAL CHANCELLOR - A 'NEGATIVE' MOTION FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE - PRECEDENTS OF 1972 AND 1982 - DISSOLUTION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT - THE EXISTENCE OF A POLITICAL CRISIS SINE QUA NON FOR A DISSOLUTION TO BE CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGITIMATE - LIMITED JUDICIAL CONTROL ON DECISION TO DISSOLVE AS SET OUT IN A 1983 RULING EVEN FURTHER LIMITED IN THE 2005 RULING - EFFECTS OF THE EXERCISED JUDICIAL SELF-RESTRAINT ON CONSTITUTIONAL DIVISION OF POWERS - NO PROOF FOR A DECLINE OF THE RULE OF LAW OR OF ACCEPTANCE OF DIRECTLY DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS - STRENGTHENING OF THE POWERS OF THE FEDERAL CHANCELLOR SIGN OF FAITH IN THE STABILITY OF THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM.
305	THE ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT A COMPULSORY DEPOSIT ON ONE-WAY PACKAGING OF BEVERAGES SUCH AS BEER, MINERAL WATER AND CARBONATED SOFT DRINKS HAS BEEN ADDITIONALLY FUELED BY THE RECENT DRAFT AMENDMENT TO THE GERMAN PACKAGING ACT. THE LAWYER HANS-GUNTER MARRENBACH NOT ONLY REVIEWS THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE PRIVILEGED TREATMENT OF ECOLOGICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS BEVERAGE PACKAGING UNDER ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS, BUT ALSO EXPLORES THE COMPATIBILITY OF THIS COMPULSORY DEPOSIT WITH SUPERIOR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OR EUROPEAN LEGISLATION BY MEANS OF SELECTED UP-TO-DATE EXAMPLES OF PENDING LAW SUITS. THE FOCUS OF THE EXAMINATION IS ON THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THE FREE TRADE OF COMMODITIES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN SINGLE MARKET AND THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW IN THE LIGHT OF THE GROWING ECOLOGIZATION TENDENCES IN POLITICS.
306	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF THE DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) ON THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY CAPTURED BY DEMOCRACY AND CORRUPTION IN A FEW AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO DO SO, WE SPECIFY A PANEL TOBIT MODEL IN WHICH DEMOCRACY IS MEASURED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDEX PROPOSED BY THE ICRG, WHILE CORRUPTION IS APPROXIMATED BY THE CORRUPTION CONTROL INDEX. OUR MODEL IS ESTIMATED ON A SAMPLE OF 40 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1995-2018. OVERALL, THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT ICT DIFFUSION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND REDUCES THE PROPENSITY TO CORRUPTION IN THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES. WE SUGGEST STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY, A SOURCE OF POSITIVE EXTERNALITIES ON CORRUPTION.
307	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STATE COURT CASES EVER DECIDED. IN MONTANA EX REL. CASHMORE V. ANDERSON, THE MONTANA SUPREME COURT EXERCISED ITS ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO ORDER, BY A 3-2 MARGIN, THAT THE STATE'S ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION BE REPLACED WITH ONE THE PEOPLE APPARENTLY HAD FAILED TO RATIFY IN DOING SO, THE COURT YIELDED TO INTEREST GROUPS THAT FAVORED REPLACING THE ORIGINAL STATE CONSTITUTION WITH AN INSTRUMENT BASED ON RADICALLY DIFFERENT PREMISES. POLITICAL THREATS MAY HAVE CAUSED THE SWING JUSTICE TO VOTE FOR THE NEW CONSTITUTION, BUT EVEN IF THAT DID NOT OCCUR, THE CASE REPRESENTS A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROPOSES REFORMS THAT MAY REDUCE THE CHANCES OF A RECURRENCE.
308	THE STATES' POWER TO EXPROPRIATE IS DETERMINED BY HOW ITS PROPERTY'S SOCIAL FUNCTION IS UNDERSTOOD. IN DOING SO, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THAT THE EXPROPRIATION AUTHORITY HAS A LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POLICY RATIONALE IN WHICH THE CONCEPT GIVEN TO THE PROPERTY - INSOFAR THIS "IS" OR "HAS" A SOCIAL PURPOSE-, DETERMINES THE GUIDELINES UNDER WHICH THE POWER OF EXPROPRIATION IS APPLIED. THE FOREGOING IMPLIES A READING OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTY IN THE LIGHT OF THE SPANIARD AND COLOMBIAN SOCIAL STATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW IN A COMPARATIVE LAW EXERCISE THAT AIMS TO REVIEW IN DETAIL THE BASIS OF THE EXPROPRIATORY POWER. THIS, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AND ALLOW TO ESTABLISH THE SCOPE OF THE EXPROPRIATION IN ITS RESPECTIVE LEGAL ORDERS.
309	GERMANS HAVE LONG PRIDED THEMSELVES ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE RECHTSSTAAT, THE STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT AGREED ON WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A RECHTSSTAAT. RECHT CAN MEAN LAW, OR RIGHT, OR JUSTICE, LEAVING OPEN WHAT A RECHTSSTAAT OUGHT TO ESTABLISH. MOREOVER, A RECHTSSTAAT COULD BE MERELY FORMAL, AN INDEPENDENTLY ADJUDICATED PROCESS OF APPLYING STATUTES EQUALLY BINDING FOR ALL, OR SUBSTANTIVE, A PROCESS PROVIDING JUSTICE. FORMAL PROCESSES SHOULD MINIMIZE CAPRICIOUS DECISIONS BUT COULD, IN PARTICULAR CASES, PRODUCE OUTCOMES THAT CITIZENS PERCEIVED AS UNJUST, AND PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY MOST COMMITTED TO OUTCOMES THEY BELIEVE TO BE JUST OR APPROPRIATE. NOT SURPRISINGLY, A COMPLEX DEBATE DEVELOPED AMONG JURISTS, ACROSS A CENTURY AND MULTIPLE REGIMES, OVER WHAT THE RECHTSSTAAT AND RECHT MIGHT MEAN.
310	THE BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN WHICH THE COLOMBIAN STATE IS FOUNDED, MAKES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO ENJOY FREEDOM, HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTATION OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY, ENSURE IT IS CLEAR THAT MANY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE CONDEMNED WILL BE SUSPENDED AND LIMITED. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO WORK AND THE RIGHT TO WORK, KEEP IN MIND THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS LIMITED, NOT SUSPENDED AND THAT THE STATE GUARANTEES IT. THE ARTICLE PRESENTED BELOW ANALYZES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO WORK IN THE PRISON AND JAIL CODE, COMPARED TO THE JUDGMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THAT EXIST ON THE SUBJECT, AND WHAT YOU NEED, IS IN A CRITICAL WAY, TO QUESTION THE TREATMENT OF THIS RIGHT IN COLOMBIAN LAW.
311	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF TWO DISTINCT PHASES OF INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT IN KOSOVO. WE ARGUE THAT A NUMBER OF FLAWS DEVELOPED DURING UNMIK'S ADMINISTRATION (1999-2008), WHICH CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE KOSOVO'S STABILITY. WE THEN DISENTANGLE THE COMPLEX INTER-INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN ICO, EULEX, UNMIK AND THE OSCE. INDEED, THEIR INCOMPATIBLE POSITIONS TOWARDS KOSOVO'S STATUS RESULTS IN A LACK OF CLARITY, COORDINATION AND COHERENCE THAT WEAKEN KOSOVO WITHIN FOUR POLICY AREAS: KOSOVO'S INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION AND PARTICIPATION, THE RULE OF LAW, INTERETHNIC RELATIONS AND THE FATE OF NORTH KOSOVO. WHILE THESE SHORTCOMINGS COULD BE VIEWED AS 'UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES', WE ARGUE MORE BROADLY THAT THE KOSOVO CASE ILLUSTRATES THE LIMITS OF LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING AND THE TENSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF STRATEGIC PEACEBUILDING.
312	VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA HAS BEEN INDEFATIGABLY COMMITTED TO HIS COUNTRY SINCE THE AGE OF 18. FOR HIM, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA ARE PARAMOUNT. HE FOUGHT AGAINST ELECTORAL FRAUD, POLITICAL PERSECUTION, AND IMPUNITY FOR MURDERERS IN UNIFORM, WAS FORCED TO WITNESS THE MURDER OF HIS ALLY AND FRIEND BORIS NEMTSOV, AND BARELY SURVIVED TWO POISON ATTACKS. AFTER RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE, HE JOINED OTHERS IN CALLING ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DECLARE RUSSIA'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP WAR CRIMINALS FOR ORDERING THE ATTACK ON UKRAINE. NOW, KARA-MURZA HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON. THE REGIME WANTS HIS POLITICAL AND PHYSICAL DEATH. HIS STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE - UNTIL HE IS REHABILITATED IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE IN A DEMOCRATIC RUSSIA.
313	THIS ARTICLE IS A CONTINUATION OF MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER METAPHOR THAN "BALANCING" TO SEEK MUTUAL VINDICATION OF THE IMPORTANT VALUES OF SECURITY AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. HERE I SUGGEST THE METAPHOR OF HOW RESIN HELPS HOLD TOGETHER LAYERS OF FABRIC TO CREATE FIBERGLASS OR KEVLAR. THE RESIN, I SUGGEST, THAT BINDS THE SHEETS OF MATERIAL TOGETHER ARE THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THAT UNDERLY LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM-INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, DUE PROCESS, THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, AND EQUAL PROTECTION. I FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON IMPORTANT MESSAGES FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES UPON HIS ELECTION AS PRESIDENT AND HIS MESSAGE TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN UPON HIS RETIREMENT FOR GUIDANCE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO THE DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENT IN SELF-GOVERNMENT.
314	THE PRESENT INTROSPECTION OFFERS SOME DOGMATIC ELEMENTS AND GENERAL REFLECTIONS ABOUT THE ASSOCIATIVE CRIMES THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED IN THE CRIMINAL LEGISLATION BOTH IN ITALY AND IN MEXICO. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO LEGISLATIVE MODULATION, AS WELL AS SOME PROBLEMS DERIVED FROM ITS SPECIFIC TREATMENT. ITS STRUCTURAL FORM IS ANALYZED, THE INTEGRATIVE ELEMENTS OF THE TYPICAL BEHAVIORS OF ASSOCIATION TO COMMIT A CRIME AND THE MAFIA-TYPE ASSOCIATION IN THE CASE OF ITALY; AND GANG ACTIVITY, CRIMINAL ASSOCIATION, AND ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE CASE OF MEXICO. FINALLY, THE CONCLUSION WAS REACHED THAT THESE ARE TYPICAL COMPLEX BEHAVIORS, DIFFUSE REGARDING TO THE PROTECTED LEGAL RIGHT, HIGHLY DANGEROUS THAT VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW, OVERREGULATED, AND EXCESSIVE PROTECTION THAT ANTICIPATES AN ABSTRACT DANGER.
315	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF "INFORMAL INSTITUTIONALIZATION" IN POST-COMMUNIST RUSSIA IN THEORETICAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE. IT IS DEVOTED TO CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTING EXPLANATIONS OF THE DOMINANCE OF SUBVERSIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT IS, THOSE RULES, NORMS, AND PRACTICES THAT AT FIRST SIGHT PARTLY RESEMBLE INSTITUTIONS OF MODERN DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW, BUT IN FACT INHIBIT THEM. WHILE "PESSIMISTS" FOCUS ON CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL EMBEDDEDNESS OF SUBVERSIVE INSTITUTIONS IN RUSSIA, "OPTIMISTS" DRAW THEIR ATTENTION TO PATTERNS OF POST-COMMUNIST STATE-BUILDING, AND "REALISTS" POINT OUT THE MAJOR ROLE OF SPECIAL INTERESTS GROUPS IN TURNING GROWING PAINS OF INFORMAL GOVERNANCE IN RUSSIA INTO ITS CHRONIC DECEASES. (C) 2012 THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
316	OUR GOALS IN THIS ARTICLE ARE TO SUMMARIZE THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON THE ROLE BUSINESS CAN PLAY IN CREATING SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT AVENUES FOR EXTENDING THIS RESEARCH. AS PART OF OUR DISCUSSION, WE REVIEW THE ETHICAL ARGUMENTS AND RELATED RESEARCH MADE TO DATE, INCLUDING THE RATIONALE AND MOTIVATION FOR BUSINESSES TO ENGAGE IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACE BUILDING, AND DISCUSS HOW SCHOLARS ARE EXTENDING RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC WAYS COMPANIES CAN ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN CONFLICT REDUCTION INCLUDING PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PRINCIPLES OF EXTERNAL VALUATION, CONTRIBUTING TO A SENSE OF COMMUNITY, AND ENGAGING IN TRACK-TWO DIPLOMACY AND CONFLICT SENSITIVE PRACTICES. WE CONCLUDE BY DEVELOPING A SET OF FUTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS.
317	ATTEMPTS TO "REGULATE" CIVIL SERVICE PERSONNEL - TO HOLD BUREAUCRATS ACCOUNTABLE, WHETHER TO POLITICIANS, THE PEOPLE, PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OR THE RULE OF LAW - ARE AS OLD AS THE POLITICIAN-BUREAUCRAT RELATIONSHIP ITSELF. POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA ARE CALLING FOR GREATER BUREAUCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN A VARIETY OF COUNTRY SETTINGS: ONE-PARTY STATES AND EMERGING DEMOCRACIES, AND IN COUNTRIES WITH CAPABLE AS WELL AS RUDIMENTARY BUREAUCRACIES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK THAT UNPACKS THE IDIOMS USED IN COMMON ACCOUNTABILITY REFORMS APPLIED IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES INTO FOUR CATEGORIES - "RULES," "WATCHDOGS," "CULTURE," AND "RE-ENGINEERING" - AND RELATES REFORM SELECTION AND IMPLEMENTATION TO COUNTRY GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS. THE FRAMEWORK IS USED TO IDENTIFY REFORM OPPORTUNITIES, CONSTRAINTS AND LIKELY TRAJECTORIES IN THE DIVERSE SOUTHEAST ASIAN CONTEXT.
318	HUMAN RIGHTS AND LIBERAL TRADE RULES (INCLUDING WTO RULES) ARE BASED ON THE SAME VALUES: INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY (E.G. TO ADJUST TO COMPETITION); NON-DISCRIMINATION; RULE OF LAW; ACCESS TO COURTS AND ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES; PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE THROUGH PEACEFUL COOPERATION AMONG FREE CITIZENS; PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RULES. THE NON-ECONOMIC VALUES OF WTO LAW ARE NO LESS IMPORTANT FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF CITIZENS THAN THE ECONOMIC WELFARE EFFECTS OF LIBERAL TRADE. LIKE THE EC, THE WTO CAN AND SHOULD BECOME AN ADVOCATE NOT ONLY OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, BUT OF HUMAN FREEDOM MORE GENERALLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES IN FAVOUR OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS OF WTO LAW SO AS TO TAKE CIVIL SOCIETY AND HUMAN RIGHTS MORE SERIOUSLY.
319	THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC IS FREQUENTLY INVOKED IN POLITICAL THEORY AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN THE ISSUE IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES TO INTERNAL, FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES. I EXPLORE THAT EXAMPLE THROUGH THE LENS OF A 1932 COURT CASE THAT TESTED THE LEGALITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ''COUP'' AGAINST PRUSSIA. IN MY ANALYSIS OF THE COURT'S JUDGMENT AND OF THE ARGUMENTS OF THREE POLITICAL AND PUBLIC LAW THEORISTS, CARL SCHMITT, HANS KELSEN, AND HERMANN HELLER, I ARGUE FOR HELLER'S DEMOCRATIC VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MY CONCLUSION, I COMPARE PROBLEMS IN KELSEN'S POSITION WITH PROBLEMS IN THE RECENTLY ARTICULATED POSITION OF JOHN RAWLS IN ORDER TO SUGGEST WHAT LESSONS WEIMAR MAY HAVE FOR CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY.
320	THE BECKET CONTROVERSY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN MISREPRESENTED AS SIMPLY A CONFLICT BETWEEN A UNIVERSAL IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEMAND OF A PARTICULAR GROUP FOR CERTAIN KINDS OF IMMUNITY. THE ISSUE WAS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE SECULAR COURT'S RIGHT TO JUDGE DELINQUENT CLERKS, BUT ABOUT RIGHTS OF APPEAL AND THE CONTROL OF ECCLESIASTICAL PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES NOT DETERMINED BY LAY AUTHORITY. BUT BECKET'S BELIEF THAT SUCH RESISTANCE REQUIRED A DOCTRINE OF THE FREEDOM OF THE CLERGY FROM LAY COURTS IN RESPECT TO ALL THEIR ACTIONS (WITH ECCLESIASTICAL COURTS FREE TO IMPOSE PENALTIES AIMED AT PENANCE AND RESTORATION) CARRIES ITS OWN PROBLEMS AND HELPS TO SHAPE A CLERICAL CULTURE WHOSE DANGEROUS LONG-TERM EFFECTS CAN BE SEEN IN THE RECENT CHILD ABUSE SCANDALS.
321	USING A SAMPLE OF FIRMS FROM THE WORLD BANK ENTERPRISE SURVEY FOR THE PERIOD 2006-2016 IN EMERGING AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT CORRUPTION HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF INNOVATIONS, THUS SUPPORTING THE "SANDING-THE-WHEELS" HYPOTHESIS. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT CORRUPTION AT THE FIRM LEVEL, IN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, AND IN REGIONS WITH THE WORST GOVERNANCE OR THAT ARE MORE CORRUPT HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INNOVATION. IN ADDITION, COUNTRY GOVERNANCE PLAYS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY FOR CORRUPT FIRMS. THE POLICY IMPLICATION IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR AUTHORITY SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE POSITIVE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION IN ORDER TO IMPROVE FIRMS' INNOVATION WITHIN AN ENVIRONMENT OF CORRUPTION.
322	THIS STUDY ASSESSES LINKAGES BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS IN 49 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE YEAR 2012. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES AND QUANTILE REGRESSIONS. TEN BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ARE USED, NOTABLY: (I) POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING "VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY" AND POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE); (II) ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (INVOLVING REGULATION QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS); (III) INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (COMPRISING THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL) AND (IV) GENERAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE). SOCIAL MEDIA IS MEASURED WITH FACEBOOK PENETRATION. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FACEBOOK PENETRATION IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS AND THESE POSITIVE NEXUSES DIFFER IN TERMS OF SIGNIFICANCE AND MAGNITUDE OF SIGNIFICANCE THROUGHOUT THE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS.
323	TO WHAT EXTENT HAS THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) FOREIGN POLICY BEEN COHERENT IN THE WESTERN BALKANS? MOREOVER, IS EU POLICY BEHAVIOUR SEEN AS COHERENT BY LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS? SUCH QUESTIONS ARE OF HIGH SIGNIFICANCE REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE EU AS AN EXTERNAL ACTOR AND WITH REGARD TO THE WESTERN BALKANS IN PARTICULAR. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES EU POLICY COHERENCE IN THE CASE OF KOSOVO, FOCUSING ON THE LATTER'S EU ACCESSION PROSPECTS AND THE EU RULE OF LAW MISSION EULEX. INTRODUCING THE NOVEL CONCEPT OF PERCEIVED COHERENCE', THE PAPER ARGUES THAT EU POLICIES AND ACTORS ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS COHERENT BY BOTH LOCAL ELITES AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNION'S FOREIGN POLICY IN KOSOVO REMAINS LOW.
324	IN THIS PAPER, WE SHALL USE THE PERSPECTIVAL VIEW ON JUSTICE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRANSCENDENT VIEW ON JUSTICE WITH THE ADVERSARIAL PRACTICE OF JUSTICE. ITS MAIN IDEA IS THAT, BEFORE SEEING JUSTICE AS ADMINISTRATION, IT HAS TO BE SEEN IN ITSELF. THE FIRST SECTION OF THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE MEANING OF JUSTICE FROM A PHENOMENOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, WHICH ENABLES US TO ENVISION JUSTICE AS TRANSCENDENT. THE SECOND SECTION OF THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE PLURI-PERSPECTIVISM OF LAW AND JUSTICE ON THE PROCEDURAL LEVEL. THROUGH A SERIES OF REFLECTIONS UPON THE PROCEDURAL ASPECTS AS THEY ARE OPERATING IN THE ROMANIAN JUDICIARY, WE SHOW HOW THE PLURALITY OF PERSPECTIVES TENDS TO CONVERGE AND FINDS ITS RESOLUTION IN THE RULE OF LAW AND MODERN DEMOCRACY.
325	THE PAPER EXAMINES, BY THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPARATIVE LAW, THE REGULATION OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS IN RECENT CONSTITUTIONS OF VENEZUELA (1999), ECUADOR (2008) AND BOLIVIA (2009) AND COMPARES THE MODEL OF THE ICCPR IN 1966 AND THE DOMINANT MODEL IN EUROPE, EXEMPLIFIED BY THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1978. MAKE A POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS IN ALL THREE COUNTRIES, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS NO RADICAL BREAK WITH THE LIBERAL MODEL, BUT INTRODUCING THE SAME ELEMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SOCIAL THEORY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AS ASSUMED BY THE EUROPEAN THEORY MORE ADVANCED. THE PAPER FINDS PROBLEMS OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY IN VENEZUELA, WHOSE CAUSE IS STILL INSUFFICIENT CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LIFE.
326	THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF FOUR MAJOR RIOTS IN NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN 1854 AND 1874, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CENTRAL ROLE OF LOCAL POLICE FORCES IN THE VIOLENT NEW ORLEANS POLITICAL CULTURE. THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS, THE PAPER QUESTIONS THE EXTENT TO WHICH NOT JUST EXCLUSION, BUT POLITICAL VIOLENCE, IS EMBEDDED IN AMERICAN REPUBLICANISM. FROM THE RE-INTEGRATION OF THE CITY IN 1852 WELL INTO THE JIM CROW ERA, POLICE FORCES SERVED AS PARTY OPERATIVES IN NEW ORLEANS, INSURING THROUGH VIOLENCE THAT THEIR PARTY WON MAJORITY ON THE CITY COUNCIL OR LOSING THEIR POSITIONS, EN MASSE, IF THEY DID NOT. THESE PATTERNS OF MOB VIOLENCE HIGHLIGHT THE REMARKABLE EXTENT TO WHICH MAJORITY APPROVAL FIGURED OVER RULE OF LAW IN MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY REPUBLICANISM.
327	EXTERNAL REGULATION IS CRUCIAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF MEDIA ATTENTION ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE FROM 2011 TO 2021, USING CHINA'S PUBLIC COMPANIES AS OUR SAMPLES. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT MEDIA ATTENTION CONSISTENTLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCES CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. THIS EFFECT REMAINS ROBUST ACROSS ENDOGENEITY CONSIDERATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE TESTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN REGIONS WITH HIGHER MARKETIZATION AND STRONGER RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORKS, THE EFFICACY OF MEDIA ATTENTION IN IMPROVING CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE BECOMES REMARKABLY PRONOUNCED. FURTHER ANALYSIS UNVEILS THAT MEDIA ATTENTION POSITIVELY IMPACTS ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE BY ELEVATING PUBLIC AWARENESS, REFINING INTERNAL MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCY, AND FOSTERING INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR MINIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THESE RESULTS OFFER EMPIRICAL BACKING FOR THE REINFORCEMENT OF EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES.
328	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE LEGAL INSTITUTE KNOWN IN BRAZIL AS THE PLEA BARGAIN. HAVING IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW CONSTITUTIONALLY CONSECRATED AS UNAFFORDABLE NORMATIVE AND AXIOLOGICAL REFERENCES, FROM A CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGICAL READING OF THE SOCIAL REALITY OF THE CRIMINAL SCIENCES, AND THROUGH THE TECHNIQUES OF DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVISION, FOLLOWING THE FRAMEWORK THEORETICIAN ON THE SUBJECT ALLOWS DEBATE ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INSERTION OF THIS INSTITUTE IN THE BRAZILIAN CRIMINAL PROCESS. THEN, BY MEANS OF THE DIALECTICAL-ARGUMENTATIVE APPROACH METHOD, HOW CAN WE REACH THE ANSWER TO THE CENTRAL PROBLEM OF THE RESEARCH, NAMELY, "IS THE NEGOTIATING INSTITUTE OF THE PLEA BARGAIN COMPATIBLE WITH THE PREMISES OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW?"
329	LEGAL CLARITY IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND MEASURE BECAUSE OF ITS CONNECTION TO THE RULE OF LAW. WE PROVIDE THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC EXAMINATION OF THE CLARITY OF SUPREME COURT OPINIONS AND DISCOVER FIVE IMPORTANT RESULTS. FIRST, CERTAIN JUSTICES SYSTEMATICALLY CRAFT CLEARER OPINIONS THAN OTHERS. JUSTICES SCALIA AND BREYER WRITE THE CLEAREST OPINIONS, WHILE JUSTICE GINSBURG CONSISTENTLY WRITES THE MOST COMPLEX OPINIONS. SECOND, IDEOLOGY DOES NOT PREDICT CLARITY IN MAJORITY OR CONCURRING OPINIONS. THIRD, ALL JUSTICES WRITE CLEARER DISSENTS THAN MAJORITY OPINIONS, WHILE MINIMUM WINNING COALITIONS PRODUCE THE CLEAREST MAJORITY OPINIONS. FOURTH, JUSTICES ACROSS THE BOARD WRITE CLEARER OPINIONS IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CASES THAN IN ANY OTHER ISSUE AREA. FINALLY, OPINIONS THAT FORMALLY ALTER COURT PRECEDENT RENDER LESS CLEAR LAW, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO A CYCLE OF LEGAL AMBIGUITY.
330	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED MYRIAD BRAIN-WRACKING QUESTIONS TO DECISION-MAKERS AT ALL LEVELS. VIET NAM MANAGED TO CURB MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY TO PRAISEWORTHY LEVELS IN THE PAST COVID-19 WAVES, HOWEVER, HAS NOW HAD ITS BACK AGAINST THE WALL AMIDST THE RECENT EXPONENTIAL INFECTION CASES AND DRAINING MEDICAL RESOURCES. FOR SWIFTLY FLATTENING THE CURVE, THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE BOLDER STEPS WHERE NEEDED, EVEN DIFFERENT FROM THE LAWS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE THE EMPOWERMENT COMES FROM THE GOODWILL OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTAINING THE RAGING OUTBREAK, THERE REMAIN PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES. THIS SHOULD GARNER MORE ATTENTION FROM THE STATE AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGALITY OF ALL STATE ACTIONS DURING THE TIME OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.
331	MULTI-MODAL ARGUMENTATION IS A RELATIVELY NEW APPROACH IN ARGUMENTATION THEORY. IN GILBERT'S APPROACH TO MULTI-MODALITY, IT FOCUSSES NOT ONLY ON THE LOGICAL MODE OF ARGUMENTATION BUT ALSO ON THE EMOTIONAL, THE KISCERAL, AND THE VISCERAL: THE SO-CALLED "ALTERNATE" MODES. DUE TO THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS IN LAW, THE LOGICAL MODE (IN ITS DIALECTICAL VARIANT) IS A NORMATIVE IMPERATIVE DUE TO THE DEMANDS OF THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY IN THE SO-CALLED UNCLEAR CASES, WE CAN FIND TRACES OF THE ALTERNATE MODES, EITHER IN THEIR DIALECTICAL OR RHETORICAL DIMENSIONS. IF IT ALREADY HAS BEEN CLAIMED THAT LOGIC IS ONLY ONE PART OF LEGAL "BUSINESS," A MULTI-MODAL ARGUMENTATION ANALYSIS OF LAW, IN A GILBERTARIAN STYLE, IS PRESENTED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
332	WHAT IMPACT DOES PERSONALISM, OR PRESIDENTIAL DOMINANCE OF A WEAKLY ORGANIZED RULING PARTY, HAVE ON THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY? WE ARGUE THAT PRESIDENTS WHO DOMINATE THEIR OWN WEAKLY ORGANIZED PARTIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK TO CONCENTRATE POWER, UNDERMINE HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TRAMPLE THE RULE OF LAW THAN PRESIDENTS WHO PRESIDE OVER PARTIES THAT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT LEADERSHIP AND AN INSTITUTIONALIZED BUREAUCRACY. INDEPENDENT PARTY LEADERS, WE SUGGEST, WILL OFTEN TRY TO CURB THE EXCESSES OF THE PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR OWN POLITICAL PROSPECTS. WE EXPLORE THESE HYPOTHESES THROUGH A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DETERMINANTS OF THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IN 18 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES FROM 1980-2015. WE FIND THAT PERSONALISM HAS A CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IN LATIN AMERICA.
333	THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE WAS ESTABLISHED AFTER THE RAVAGING SECOND WORLD WAR WITH THE ROLE OF STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ITS MEMBER STATES, AND WITH THE OVERARCHING AIM OF CONSOLIDATING THE DEMOCRATIC STABILITY IN EUROPE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AGAINST RACISM AND INTOLERANCE (ECRI) IS ONE OF COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S TEN MONITORING BODIES AND THE SUBJECT OF THIS RESEARCH AND ARTICLE. IN THE NEXT PAGES I WILL FOCUS ON TWO OF ITS ACTIVITIES: THE GENERAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE COUNTRY REPORTS. I WILL CONCENTRATE ON HOW THE FORTY-SEVEN MEMBER STATES ADDRESS ECRI'S - GPRS ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES LIKE RACISM, XENOPHOBIA, ANTISEMITISM AND INTOLERANCE. I WILL ANALYSE THIS CONSIDERING THE LATEST COUNTRY REPORTS, FOLLOWING THE FOURTH AND THE FIFTH MONITORING CYCLES.
334	THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS THE CIRCULATION OF NORMS AND POLICY SOLUTIONS THROUGH THE EUROPEAN UNION'S DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION POLICY, THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EU AND ITS PARTNERS BEING LESS MARKED BY CONSTRAINTS THAN WITH CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. OUR ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE CONCRETE ASPECT OF THIS POLICY, BY STUDYING HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW PROMOTION THROUGH PRISON REFORM PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE EU IN ITS PARTNER STATES, MAINLY FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD. THE AGENTS MUST TRANSLATE SOFT LAW INTO ACTIONS THAT WILL MAKE UP THE PROJECT. ULTIMATELY, THE CIRCULATION WE OBSERVE IN THESE PROJECTS IS FAR FROM OBVIOUS, BUT RATHER FINE AND DEPENDENT ON INTERINDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS. AS A RESULT WE CONTEND THAT THIS CIRCULATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS DIFFUSION RATHER THAN TRANSFER.
335	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN LIFE INSURANCE MARKETS ACROSS 24 OECD COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 1993-2000. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND MARKET STRUCTURE FACTORS INFLUENCE FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN LIFE INSURANCE MARKETS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, LIFE EXPECTANCY, FOREIGN MARKET SHARE, INCOME, DEPENDENCY RATIO, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, LEVEL OF COMPETITION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MARKET LIBERALISATION HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS, WHEREAS EXPENSE/COMBINED RATIOS AND SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN LIFE INSURANCE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNANCE/LEGAL INDICATORS (COMMON LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) ALL SHOW POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IN LIFE INSURANCE MARKETS. THE GENEVA PAPERS (2009) 34, 466-482. DOI: 10.1057/GPP.2009.9
336	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT STUDIES AND PROMOTION OF CITIZENSHIP FALLS SHORT IF THEY FORGET THAT PERCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES ARE ALSO INFORMED BY CULTURE. CONCRETELY, REFERRING MAINLY TO CHILE, ECUADOR, AND BOLIVIA, IT STATES THAT (MAINLY POOR) PEOPLE ON ONE HAND "SUBVERT" THE OFFICIAL CANON WITH REGARD TO CITIZENSHIP BY PRACTICING IT PARTICULARISTICLY AND LOOKING FOR FAVORS RATHER THAN "RIGHTS," WHEREAS ON THE OTHER HAND, AWARENESS WITH REGARD TO RIGHTS EXISTS. PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES, HOWEVER, HAVE TAUGHT THEM, IN CONCRETE ENCOUNTERS WITH STATE REPRESENTATIVES, NOT TO INSIST ON THEIR RIGHTS BUT INSTEAD TO TRY FOR THE "FAVOR." NEVERTHELESS, IN EVALUATING SUCH ENCOUNTERS WITH THE STATE, PEOPLE SHOW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE CLUE OF "UNIVERSAL RULES" AND THE "RULE OF LAW" VERY WELL.
337	THIS WORK INTENDS TO CORRELATE THE PHILOSOPHICAL HERMENEUTICS TO THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NEW CPC, HIGHLIGHTING THE INFLUENCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL MATRICES IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROCEDURAL RULES; ADDRESSING, THEREFORE, THE EXEGETICAL CURRENTS OF POSITIVISM, LEGAL POSITIVISM AND LINGUISTIC ONTOLOGICAL TURN IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE ITS IMPACT ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEW PROCEDURAL SYSTEM. TO WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, THIS BLOCK OF HISTORY, THE AFFIRMATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS THE CONDITION OF POSSIBILITY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AND THIS DEMAND RESPONSIBILITIES IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THEORETICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL MATRIX TO BASE THE HERMENEUTIC ACTIVITY OF PROCEDURAL LAW MUST OVERCOME THE OLD POSITIVISM, SINCE ITS ASSUMPTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE ADS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THE PROPOSALS OF THE NEW CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE.
338	IN THIS PAPER WE WISH TO REFLECT ON THEORETICAL CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ARISEN AROUND THE CONCEPTS OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM OR, IF ONE WISHES, BETWEEN A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND CAPITALISM. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE CONCEPTS AND NOTIONS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND CONTRADICTORY THAN SUGGESTED BY THE WAY THAT IT HAS BEEN NARRATED OVER THE LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS. INDEED, THEORISTS OF ECONOMIC LIBERALISM CONSISTENTLY WISHED TO ESTABLISH THAT A GENUINE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY COULD ONLY OCCUR WHEREVER A LIBERAL ECONOMIC ORDER PREVAILED. WE MUST CHALLENGE THIS AXIOM AND EVEN INQUIRE INTO THE LIKELY FUNDAMENTAL INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN A COMPLETELY DEREGULATED FREE MARKET SYSTEM AND AN ESSENTIALLY DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REGIME.
339	THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE NATURE OF DAVID LI'S CONCEPT OF AMBIGUOUS PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THREE ANGLES TO SEE RIGHT AMBIGUITY FROM A COASIAN-CONSTRAINED CHOICE-THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE AND ELABORATE ON THAT AMBIGUITY IN TERMS OF FIVE SCENARIOS OF DE JURE AND DE FACTO RIGHTS. THE CASE OF INDIGENOUS VILLAGE HOUSING IN POST-COLONIAL HONG KONG UNDER A MATURE SYSTEM OF THE RULE OF LAW IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE AMBIGUITIES DUE TO A GAP BETWEEN DE JURE AND DE FACTO PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT MAY NOT DEGENERATE INTO ANARCHY DUE TO RATIONAL CHOICES MADE UNDER COMMON LAW CONSTRAINTS DRIVEN ULTIMATELY BY THE LAND MARKET. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CASE STUDY FOR EVALUATING AMBIGUITIES IN PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CHINA ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
340	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM KENYA'S 2007 POST ELECTION VIOLENCE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN. IT NOTES THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE VIOLENCE STILL PERSIST, HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED, AND EASILY COULD BE REIGNITED. FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN WEAKENED DELIBERATELY AND WHERE DIFFUSED VIOLENCE IS WIDESPREAD, BOTH KENYA'S TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND THE FATE OF THE NATION REMAIN VULNERABLE. THE ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT THE PROBLEMS FACED IN HOLDING AND MANAGING ELECTIONS IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS OFTEN ARE NOT SIMPLY TECHNICAL. INSTEAD, IN KENYA AND ELSEWHERE, MANY DIFFICULTIES ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF LARGER POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO DEMOCRATIC CHANGE THAT ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE IN CAUSAL TERMS OR TO ADDRESS.
341	THIS PAPER IS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE LEGAL STATE - THE RULE OF LAW REGARDING TO RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, WE ANALYSE THE APPROACH OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC IN THE PROCEEDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINT OF NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSONS REGARDING TO ARTICLE 127 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC. THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONALITY REVIEW IN CONCRETE FORM OF CONTROL SHOULD BE IN IMPLEMENTATION CONNECTED WITH THE ABSTRACT CONTROL OF CONSTITUTIONALITY TO PREVENT FUTURE VIOLATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. PRACTICE IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC IS REGARDING TO THE FORMALISTIC VIEW IN INTERPRETATION OF THE RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS DIFFERENT AS VISIBLE ON EXISTING DECISIONS.
342	THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTOUS SHIFTS UNDERWAY IN THE UN DEPARTMENT OF PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. THE UN POLICE DIVISION, LONG BACK THE 'POOR COUSIN' OF THE MILITARY SIDE OF THE HOUSE, HAS BEEN ELEVATED TO A NEW STATUS. IN THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, THE DIVISION IS NOW EMBEDDED WITHIN A RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY INSTITUTIONS PILLAR, WITH ITS OWN ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL, AND WHICH IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED AS BEING CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL CONDUCT OF UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS. THIS PAPER LOOKS AT THE RISE OF THE POLICE DIVISION WITHIN THE UN FAMILY, AND ASSESSES SOME OF THE CHALLENGES CURRENTLY FACING THE UN'S UNPRECEDENTED PUSH TO USE POLICE TO A MUCH GREATER AND DEEPER EXTENT IN VERY CHALLENGING CONTEMPORARY PEACE OPERATIONS.
343	THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLAIN THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT MUNICIPALITIES PLAYED IN THE HISPANO-AMERICAN WORLD THROUGHOUT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. ALTHOUGH IN RECENT YEARS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST SPANISH LIBERAL REGIME HAS RIGHTLY BEEN STRESSED IN THE HISTORIOGRAPHY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANT PART PLAYED BY MUNICIPALITIES IN THE ERA OF INDEPENDENCE WITHOUT ANALYZING SOME CLUES FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE BELIEFS AND DISCOURSE THAT STRUCTURED THE POLITICAL ORDER OF THE ANCIEN REGIME. THESE VALUES STEM FROM A LEGAL CULTURE, COMMON TO THE WHOLE HISPANIC WORLD, IN WHICH THE TRANSITION FROM A JURISPRUDENTIAL MODEL OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TO A ONE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW WOULD BE VERY LONG AND COMPLEX.
344	IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE CHOICES AND BUSINESS OUTCOMES WHEN OFFSHORING INNOVATION. GROUNDED IN AN INSTITUTIONAL THEORY PERSPECTIVE, WE USE SURVEY DATA FROM THE ORN DATABASE TO ESTIMATE REGRESSION MODELS AND IDENTIFY GOVERNANCE MODES RELATED TO SPECIFIC DRIVERS OF OFFSHORE INNOVATION. WE THEN ANALYSE THE EFFECT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE OF CHOOSING A GOVERNANCE MODE NOT IN LINE WITH THE ONE PREDICTED BY THE MODEL. WE FIND THAT CHOOSING A FULLY OWNED OFFSHORING OPERATION WHEN THEORY WOULD PREDICT SELECTING OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE, BUT NOT VICE VERSA. WE ALSO FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS OF RULE OF LAW AND IPR PROTECTION STRENGTH IN HOST COUNTRIES NEGATIVELY AFFECT FIRM PERFORMANCE WHEN OFFSHORING INNOVATION ACTIVITIES.
345	OUR PAPER DRAWS ATTENTION TO A NEGLECTED CHANNEL OF CORRUPTION-THE BRIBE PAYMENTS BY STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES). THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PHENOMENON AS BRIBE PAYMENTS BY SOES FRUITLESSLY WASTE NATIONAL RESOURCES, COMPROMISING PUBLIC WELFARE AND NATIONAL PROSPERITY. USING A LARGE DATASET OF 30,249 FIRMS FROM 50 COUNTRIES, WE SHOW THAT, IN GENERAL, SOES ARE LESS LIKELY TO PAY BRIBES FOR ACHIEVING ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES OWING TO THEIR POLITICAL CONNECTIVITY. HOWEVER, IN DETERIORATED INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, SOES MAY BE SUBJECTED TO POTENTIAL MANAGERIAL RENT-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, WHICH DISPROPORTIONATELY INCREASE SOE BRIBE PROPENSITY RELATIVE TO PRIVATELY OWNED ENTERPRISES. SPECIFICALLY, OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSTERING DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, REDUCING PREVALENCE OF CORRUPTION AND SHORTENING POWER DISTANCE IN REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF SOE BRIBERY.
346	THE ESSAY SITUATES THE FIELD OF TRADITIONAL JUSTIFICATION OF PARDON IN THE IDEA OF SOVEREIGNTY AND IN TWO ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THAT IDEA: MERCY AND JUSTICE. THESE TWO NOTIONS ARE IN OPPOSITION IN A CRIMINAL CONTEXT DUE TO THE ESSENTIALLY MOTIVELESS CHARACTER OF MERCY, WHICH, AS THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT SUPPORTS IT, SEEMS TO BE IN OPEN CONFLICT WITH THE MOST BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE STUDY ALSO DEALS WITH THE AMBIGUOUS NOTION OF EXCEPTIONALITY, WHICH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD EITHER AS EXTRAORDINARITY OR AS EXCEPTION, IN ORDER TO ANALYSE THE NOTION OF GENERALITY IN PARDONS AND TO CONCLUDE DEFENDING THE NEED AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIMITATIVE AND SPECIALLY RESTRICTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE RIGHT OF PARDON.
347	THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTIONS EXAMINES IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT PRELIMINARY JUDGMENTS BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE WERE USED AS AN ENFORCEMENT TOOL AND HELPED THE FULL LEGAL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF EU ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION. LOOKING AT AVAILABLE DATA ABOUT THE USE OF THIS PROCEDURE AND AT THE ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE OF MEMBER STATES AND THE EU COMMISSION IT IS CONCLUDED THAT NEITHER THE MEANS OF PRELIMINARY REFERENCE ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 267 NOR THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE 258 TFEU ARE SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLOITED FOR EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF EU ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. IN PARTICULAR, IT BECOMES EVIDENT, THAT COMMISSION DOES NOT ASSUME ITS ROLE AS ENVIRONMENTAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. IT RATHER ACTS AS AN OPPORTUNIST POLITICAL BODY WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE RULE OF LAW, BUT SOMETIMES NOT.
348	PUBLIC ACCESS TO CASE LAW IS A REQUIRED PREREQUISITE FOR THE LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. NEVERTHELESS, ACCORDING TO THE LAW, ONLY AUTHORIZED PERSONS CAN ACCESS JUDGMENTS IN THEIR NON-ANONYMIZED AND UNREDACTED FORM. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A COMPUTER AIDED METHOD FOR ANONYMIZATION AND REDACTION OF JUDGMENTS, WITH AN AIM TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY OF OVERALL PROCESS. THE ANONYMIZATION AND REDACTION PROCEDURE IS BASED ON THE ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISM FOR XML DOCUMENTS. AKOMA NTOSO IS CHOSEN AS AN XML FORMAT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER (LEGAL) INFORMATION SYSTEMS, BUT THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN BE EASILY ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT DOCUMENT TYPES AND DIFFERENT XML FORMATS. THE METHOD IS VERIFIED BY A PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH IS VALIDATED BY EMPLOYEES IN A COURT OF LAW.
349	BY DEFAULT, STATENESS IS USUALLY CONSIDERED AS A STATE'S LEGAL ABILITY TO DELIVER GOODS OR SERVICES. THIS UNDERSTANDING IMPLIES THAT STATENESS IS STRUCTURED BY THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, AS HISTORICAL AND CURRENT EXAMPLES SHOW, THIS LEGAL ABILITY OFTEN RELIES ON PRACTICES THAT ONE WOULD DEFINE AS ILLEGAL AND THAT ANY MEASURE OF 'STATENESS' MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. USING THE CASE OF THE POLICE OF THE PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES AS ART EXAMPLE, I PROPOSE THE NOTION OF HYBRID STATENESS I.E. AN UNDERSTANDING OF STATENESS THAT CONSIDERS THE STATE'S ABILITY TO OPERATE ILLEGALLY. THIS SHORT PIECE ADDRESSES THE INSTITUTIONAL AND BUDGETARY SETTING OF THE PROVINCIAL POLICE FORCE AND TACKLES THE QUESTION OF WHERE THE ILLEGAL RESOURCES FOR PERFORMING POLICE'S DUTIES COME FROM.
350	THIS PAPER USES THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL TRUST TO EXTEND THE 'INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS' OF NORTH AND OLSON, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HEDLUND'S 'PATH DEPENDENCE' ACCOUNT OF RUSSIA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FOR THIS PURPOSE IT COMPARES THE EVOLUTION OF BRITAIN AND RUSSIA SINCE THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. A KEY DETERMINANT OF SOCIAL TRUST IS THE RELATION BETWEEN THE STATE, MONEY AND THE POPULATION. IN BRITAIN TRUST WAS MOBILISED THROUGH STATE FISCAL POLICIES, PUBLIC CREDIT, AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN RUSSIA (AND THE USSR) TRUST WAS ALSO PLACED IN A STRONG STATE, BUT ONE WHICH OPERATED RATHER THROUGH PERSONAL PATRONAGE AND THE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE EXPLAINS WHY IN THE 1990S RUSSIA ADAPTED SO POORLY TO MARKET ECONOMICS.
351	FOR MOST OF U.S. HISTORY, PRESIDENTS HAVE ISSUED SIGNING STATEMENTS TO COMMENT ON BILLS BEING SIGNED INTO LAW. THESE STATEMENTS OFTEN ARE HORTATORY AND COMMENT ON THE MERITS OF THE NEW LAW. IN RECENT DECADES, PRESIDENTS ALSO HAVE USED SIGNING STATEMENTS TO INDICATE PORTIONS OF LAWS THAT THEY CONSIDER UNCONSTITUTIONAL. POINTING OUT SUCH PARTS OF NEW STATUTES IS NOT A PROBLEM, BUT INDICATING THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT EXECUTE PART OF THE LAW IS PROBLEMATIC. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH USED SIGNING STATEMENTS IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY TO IMPLY THAT HE MIGHT NOT FAITHFULLY EXECUTE MORE THAN 1,000 PROVISIONS OF STATUTES THAT HE SIGNED INTO LAW. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT THIS PRACTICE UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND THREATENS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS SYSTEM.
352	USING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO AVOID THE NEED FOR HUMAN DISCRETION IN GOVERNMENT CONTEXTS - A SCENARIO WE CALL 'RULE BY AUTOMATION' - CAN HELP US ACHIEVE THE IDEAL OF A FREE AND EQUAL SOCIETY. DRAWING ON RELATIONAL THEORIES OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY, WE EXPLAIN HOW RULE BY AUTOMATION IS A MORE COMPLETE REALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND WHY THINKERS IN THESE TRADITIONS HAVE STRONG REASONS TO SUPPORT IT. RELATIONAL THEORIES ARE BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN DOMINATION AND HIERARCHY, WHICH AUTOMATION HELPS US ACHIEVE. NEVERTHELESS, THERE IS ANOTHER UNDERSTANDING OF RELATIONAL THEORIES WHERE WHAT MATTERS IS THE PRESENCE OF VALUABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE IN POWER. EXPLORING THIS FURTHER MIGHT HELP US SEE WHEN AND WHY WE SHOULD ACCEPT HUMAN DISCRETION.
353	THIS WORK INTENDS TO CORRELATE THE PHILOSOPHICAL HERMENEUTICS TO THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE NEW CPC, HIGHLIGHTING THE INFLUENCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL MATRICES IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROCEDURAL RULES; ADDRESSING, THEREFORE, THE EXEGETICAL CURRENTS OF POSITIVISM, LEGAL POSITIVISM AND LINGUISTIC ONTOLOGICAL TURN IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE ITS IMPACT ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEW PROCEDURAL SYSTEM. TO WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, THIS BLOCK OF HISTORY, THE AFFIRMATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS THE CONDITION OF POSSIBILITY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AND THIS DEMAND RESPONSIBILITIES IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THEORETICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL MATRIX TO BASE THE HERMENEUTIC ACTIVITY OF PROCEDURAL LAW MUST OVERCOME THE OLD POSITIVISM, SINCE ITS ASSUMPTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE ADS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THE PROPOSALS OF THE NEW CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE.
354	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CURRENT RUSSIAN REGIME AND ITS POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES, BOTH NATIONALIST AND PRO-WESTERN, FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF VARIOUS THEORETICAL APPROACHES. IT ARGUES THAT APPLYING THE CRITERIA AND TERMINOLOGY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, WHICH ARE USUALLY USED IN STUDIES OF MODERN WESTERN SOCIETIES, TO DEFINE CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS JUST AS POINTLESS AS DESCRIBING ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE MODERN WESTERN POLITICAL SYSTEM. IT FURTHER STATES THAT TO ACHIEVE AN ECONOMIC BREAKTHROUGH, THE RUSSIAN LEADERSHIP WILL HAVE TO MOVE TOWARDS: DEVELOPING STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW; THE SEPARATION OF POWERS; THE RESTORATION OF SELF-GOVERNMENT; AND THE CREATION OF FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS FOR, PRIMARILY, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE BUSINESSES.
355	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE HISTORY OF THE LEGAL NEWSPAPER PRAVO AND ITS CENSORSHIP HISTORY. THE NEWSPAPER WAS AN INFLUENTIAL RUSSIAN LIBERAL PERIODICAL OF THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. IT WAS PUBLISHED WITHOUT PRE-CENSORSHIP BUT UNDERWENT PRESSURE FROM THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, RECEIVED ADMINISTRATIVE WARNINGS FOR ITS "HARMFUL DIRECTION" AND WAS ON THE VERGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE CLOSURE. PRAVO PUBLISHED ARTICLES ABOUT THE STATE OF RUSSIAN LEGISLATION, GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION AND THE COURT SYSTEM, GIVING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO PRESS LEGISLATION. IT CRITICIZED THE CENSORSHIP SYSTEM IN RUSSIA FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ARBITRARINESS AND ADVOCATED FREEDOM OF THE PRESS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE HISTORY OF CENSORSHIP AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER ITSELF IS INDICATIVE OF THE ARBITRARY CHARACTER OF RUSSIAN LAW ON FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.
356	DESPITE ARGUMENTS BY SOME SCHOLARS THAT MAGNA CARTA HAS BEEN INACCURATELY MYTHOLOGIZED, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT CONTINUES TO BE RELEVANT TO CONTEMPORARY GOVERNANCE. AFTER AN OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE GREAT CHARTER, AND A DISCUSSION OF ITS MAJOR CLAUSES, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES EXPANSIONS OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT IN ANGLO-AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE THAT TRACE THEIR ORIGINS TO MAGNA CARTA. IT ARGUES THAT THE TIMELESS PRINCIPLES EMBEDDED IN MAGNA CARTA CONTINUE TO BE RELEVANT TO CONTEMPORARY GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE U.S. PRESIDENCY. IT CONCLUDES THAT MAGNA CARTA CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT AS A CLASSIC STATEMENT OF RULE OF LAW, LIMITED GOVERNMENT, AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND A POTENT SYMBOL AND ARGUMENT FOR RESTRAINING GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL AND EXECUTIVES IN PARTICULAR.
357	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES TOWARD EXPORT IN SEVERAL ASEAN COUNTRIES. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME, WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR, AND WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FROM 2010 TO 2021. FURTHERMORE, THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A REGRESSION PANEL. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INDICATE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT HAS AN EFFECT ON EXPORTS. FOR THE DIMENSION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, REGULATORY QUALITY CAN EXPLAIN EXPORTS IN SEVERAL ASEAN COUNTRIES, WHILE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND THE RULE OF LAW DO NOT AFFECT EXPORTS. HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON EXPORT IN SEVERAL ASEAN COUNTRIES.
358	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE-SUCH AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION-ON THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT FINANCING DECISIONS OF FIRMS. THE FULL SAMPLE CONSISTS OF 31,749 FIRMS IN 65 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2017. WE FIND THAT FIRMS OPERATING IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER GOVERNANCE DECREASE THEIR LEVERAGE WHILE INCREASING THEIR DEBT MATURITY. SPECIFICALLY, WE SHOW THAT THEY DECREASE THEIR RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE WHILE THEY INCREASE THEIR RELIANCE ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY ISSUANCES IN FINANCING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO ENDOGENEITY ISSUES AND ALTERNATIVE MODEL SPECIFICATIONS. COPYRIGHT (C)& NBSP;2021, BORSA _ISTANBUL ANONIM S,IRKETI. PRODUCTION AND HOSTING BY ELSEVIER B.V.
359	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE CHALLENGE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS FOR OUR HUMANNESS. IT IS NOT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL-POLITICAL QUESTION OF WHAT MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN NOW AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, BUT ABOUT THE EXISTENTIAL-PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF HOW WE CAN MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THE CRISIS IN A HUMANE WAY. TO RECOGNIZE THE DANGER AND TO AVERT IT IS A NECESSARY, BUT NOT A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR THIS. ONE CAN FIGHT A DANGER WITH MEANS THAT ARE THEMSELVES DANGEROUS. THESE INCLUDE DISHONESTY, TOTALITARIANISM, MISANTHROPY, MONOTHEMATISM, PANIC, AND SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS. THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR A HUMANE APPROACH TO THE CRISIS INCLUDE TRUTHFULNESS, THE REDISCOVERY OF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE, ADHERENCE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, GRATITUDE, AND HOPE.
360	ACCURATE INFORMATION CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. AS MORE AND MORE COUNTRIES FALL UNDER THE SWAY OF ILLIBERAL LEADERS, ETHNOGRAPHERS MAY FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO EASILY CORROBORATE KNOWLEDGE THAT COMES FROM NATIVE INFORMANTS. THIS ARTICLE PROFFERS SEVERAL STRATEGIES FOR RESEARCHERS TO UTILIZE WHEN ANALYZING UNVERIFIABLE ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA. FOLLOWING FROM SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES OF RUMOR, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE SPECIFIC ROLE THAT RUMOR PLAYS UNDER CONDITIONS OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE. WITHOUT LEGAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ROBUST CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RULE OF LAW, IT MAY BE RISKY FOR RESEARCHERS AND INFORMANTS ALIKE TO DIG TOO DEEPLY INTO SECRET INFORMATION. ASSUMING THAT CORROBORATION IS IMPOSSIBLE, HOW MIGHT AN ETHNOGRAPHER ANALYZE THE RUMORS WITHOUT BELIEVING OR DISPUTING THEIR FACTUAL AUTHENTICITY? SEVERAL POSSIBLE APPROACHES ARE OFFERED.
361	THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW IS A THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTED BEFORE THE CONTEMPORARY SCENARIO, AS A GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED BY THE IMPORTANCE THAT SUSTAINABILITY HAS BEEN GAINING IN RECENT DECADES. IN VIEW OF THIS, IT IS IDEALIZED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROMOTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL APPROACH, PROPOSING THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW `SUSTAINABLE WORLD MODEL IS A TASK THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. HOWEVER, SEVERAL PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE OR EVEN EXIST, AND DESPITE LEGAL PREDICTION, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WAS SLOW TO BE INCLUDED IN EDUCATIONAL POLICIES.
362	CHARRON N., DIJKSTRA L. AND LAPUENTE V. REGIONAL GOVERNANCE MATTERS: QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT WITHIN EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES, REGIONAL STUDIES. THIS STUDY PRESENTS NOVEL DATA (EUROPEAN QOG INDEX - EQI) ON THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT' (QOG) - UNDERSTOOD AS LOW CORRUPTION, IMPARTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES AND RULE OF LAW - FOR NATIONAL AND SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS IN TWENTY-SEVEN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. THE EQI SHOWS NOTABLE WITHIN-COUNTRY VARIATIONS: WHILE HIGH-PERFORMING REGIONS IN ITALY AND SPAIN (FOR EXAMPLE, BOLZANO, PAIS VASCO) RANK AMONGST THE BEST EUROPEAN UNION REGIONS, OTHERS PERFORM WELL BELOW THE EUROPEAN UNION AVERAGE. THE INDEX IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND LEVELS OF SOCIAL TRUST, YET POLITICAL DECENTRALIZATION IS UNCORRELATED WITH GREATER WITHIN-COUNTRY, OR HIGHER LEVELS OF OVERALL, QOG.
363	THE ARTICLE SETS OUT TO EXPLORE THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DIMENSION IN JURGEN HABERMAS' LATEST PUBLICATIONS ON PHILOSOPHY OF LAW. IT IS OUR VIEW THAT HABERMAS DEALS WITH THE EXAMINATION OF JUST RELATIONS BEYOND THE NATION-STATE FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, AND THAT THE KEY TO A HABERMASIAN READING OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE IS NOT THROUGH AN APPLICATION OF DISCOURSETHEORETICAL MODELS OF COMMUNICATIVE OR MORAL ACTION AS SUCH, BUT PRIMARILY THROUGH PROPER LEGAL INSTITUTIONALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN ASSERTING THIS VIEW, WE WILL LOOK CLOSER AT THE KANTIAN INFLUENCE IN HABERMAS' LEGAL CONSTRUCT AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AND SHOW WHY THIS INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH IS TO BE SHARPLY DISTINGUISHED FROM AND PREFERRED TO ANY EXCLUSIVELY NON-INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE.
364	STARTING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SO-CALLED ABYEI ARBITRATION-WHICH CONCERNED SUDAN'S HIGHLY POLITICAL AND EMOTIVE SITUATION OF THE DELIMITATION OF THE COUNTRY'S OIL-RICH ABYEI REGION-THE AUTHORS DISCUSS THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DEEPLY ROOTED CONFLICTS BETWEEN POLITICAL FACTIONS AND/OR STATES AND PEOPLES. AFTER HAVING PONDERED THE OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITATIONS PRESENTED BY ARBITRATION FOR SUCH DISPUTES, AND CONSIDERED THE RECORD OF IMPLEMENTATIONS OF AWARDS, THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT ARBITRATION CAN AND DOES SERVE AS A USEFUL DISPUTE RESOLUTION METHOD. BUT A CAVEAT IS ENTERED: IF THE INTEGRITY OF THE ARBITRAL PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW IS TO BE UPHELD, THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL NEEDS TO BE GIVEN PARTICULAR ATTENTION.
365	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS UNIVERSAL AND SYSTEMATIC TOOL OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN POST-CONFLICT OR POST-DICTATORIAL CONTEXTS WITH A STRONG LINK TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS. THUS, POST-CONFLICT STATES FROM DIVERSE REGIONS OF THE GLOBE-FROM EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND LATIN AMERICA TO AFRICA AND ASIA-APPLY TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS HOPING IT WOULD POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO A PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO A DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CASES OF TWO SMALL STATES: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA AND TUNISIA, THAT PUT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO TACKLE THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND TO FURTHER A FULL DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. IT WILL ILLUSTRATE THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THESE TWO STATES WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL, SOCIOCULTURAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT IN APPLYING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS.
366	THIS WORK BRINGS TO LIGHT THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP OCCURRING BETWEEN THE "SUPRANATIONAL" TREASURY OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY AND LOCAL TREASURIES IN THE MODERN ERA. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A DISTINCTION IS MADE OF THE POLITICAL-LEGAL-MILITARY POWER OF THE "KING", WHOSE MANIFESTATIONS ARE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE FOR THE RESOLUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND MILITARY REQUIREMENTS; OF THE ECONOMIC-ADMINISTRATIVE POWER OF THE "KINGDOM", MEETING IN THE PARLIAMENT, OR SEPARATE IN THE CITY COUNCILS OF THE TWENTY-ONE CITIES OF THE CROWN OF CASTILE, AND WHOSE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE WAS THE SATISFACTION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE LOCAL OLIGARQUIES. THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER BETWEEN THE ELITES WAS ONE OF THE CAUSES WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY FINANCIAL REFORMS.
367	EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES TYPICALLY USE A PROCESS OF "NOTICE AND COMMENT" TO PERMIT THE PUBLIC TO RESPOND TO THE PROPOSED TEXT OF RULES. THE LEGAL LITERATURE HAS NOT CONSIDERED WHETHER A SIMILAR PROCESS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT WOULD BE. NEITHER THE PARTIES TO A LITIGATION NOR THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON JUDICIAL OPINIONS AFTER THEY ARE DRAFTED BUT BEFORE THEY ARE MADE FINAL. AS A RESULT, JUDICIAL OPINIONS OFTEN CONTAIN ERRORS AND FREQUENTLY HAVE FAR-RANGING AND UNANTICIPATED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. A NOTICE-AND-COMMENT SYSTEM COULD MITIGATE THESE CONCERNS, AND COULD ALSO HELP TO CONSTRAIN JUDGES TO FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW AND TO IMPROVE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.
368	WHILE GOVERNMENT TURNOVER IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS AN ADVERSE SOURCE OF INSTABILITY, IT MAY ALSO BE VIEWED AS A FAVOURABLE SOURCE OF COMPETITION AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING. TO ARTICULATE AND TEST SUCH HYPOTHESES, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES TWO MAIN CONCEPTS OF GOVERNMENT TURNOVER: LEADERSHIP TURNOVER, OR CHANGE IN RULERS, AND IDEOLOGICAL TURNOVER, OR CHANGE IN THE RULERS' IDEOLOGY. REFINEMENTS INVOLVE THE MODE, OUTCOME AND TIMING OF TURNOVER. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES MEASUREMENT ISSUES THAT ARISE WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE POWER INSTITUTIONS AND WHEN PARLIAMENTS ARE CONTROLLED BY CHANGING MAJORITY COALITIONS. THE MEASURES OF TURNOVER ARE ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMINING THE POST-COMMUNIST WORLD. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HIGHER CUMULATIVE POST-TRANSITION TURNOVER - IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIPS OR IDEOLOGIES - HAS ASSISTED IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW.
369	EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY REGARDED "HUMAN RIGHTS'' AND ONE WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED MOST EXTENSIVELY WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, SO THAT ITS NORMATIVE CORPUS ALREADY FORMS A VERY INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION LAW. THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION MEANS A NEW RIGHT TO A NEW EDUCATION THAT, IN THE RULE OF LAW, MAY BE QUALIFIED AS RIGHTFUL EDUCATION. SUCH AN EXPRESSION IS AN OPERATING CONCEPT FOR A HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH TO EDUCATION; THAT IS, FOR AN EDUCATION NO LONGER ENVISAGED AS A RIGHT OF MAN OVER MAN. IT AMOUNTS TO A NEW PARADIGM. IT IS THEREFORE HIGH TIME TO SYSTEMATIZE THE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION LAW IN ORDER TO PROMOTE ITS STUDY AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A LEGAL DIMENSION INTO PEDAGOGIC CULTURE.
370	MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DARK SIDE OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC BOOM. PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES, LARGE-SCALE MIGRATION AND DIMINISHING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALL COSTS INCURRED BY CHINA FROM THE COUNTRY'S FAILURE TO INTEGRATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUCCESSFULLY. NOW CHINA'S LEADERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO USE THE COUNTRY'S TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY AND INTEGRATION INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY TO HELP PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, ADVANCING POLICIES SUCH AS GREEN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, TRADABLE PERMITS, ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP BY MULTINATIONALS AND NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MODEL CITIES. THE SUCCESS OF THESE POLICIES, HOWEVER, RESTS ON A BROADER AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL SET OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS THAT WOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY, RULE OF LAW AND OFFICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THUS REMAINS IN QUESTION.
371	THE CONCEPT OF "TIME AND SPACE COMPRESSION," AS FORMULATED BY A NUMBER OF PROMINENT SOCIAL THEORISTS, HAS FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR DEMOCRATIC THEORY. THE TIME AND SPACE HORIZONS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY ARE UNDERGOING DRAMATIC CHANGES, CHIEFLY BECAUSE THE HIGH-SPEED CHARACTER OF CRUCIAL FORMS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TENDS TO "ANNIHILATE" DISTANCE. SIMULTANEITY AND INSTANTANEOUSNESS INCREASINGLY BECOME CONSTITUTIVE FEATURES OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. BY EXAMINING TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT TIME AND SPACE WITHIN LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL THEORY, WE CAN BEGIN TO SEE HOW TIME AND SPACE COMPRESSION UNDERMINES CONVENTIONAL IDEAS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE-EXECUTIVE RELATIONS, MAJORITY RULE, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE WAYS BY WHICH DEFENDERS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY CAN OVERCOME THE DILEMMAS GENERATED BY TIME AND SPACE COMPRESSION.
372	U.S. INTERESTS IN HONG KONG ARE EXTENSIVE AND HAVE GROWN ALONG WITH THE TERRITORY'S PROSPERITY AND ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THESE INTERESTS WILL BE MAINTAINED AS SOVEREIGNTY OVER HONG KONG SHIFTS FROM BRITAIN TO CHINA, PROVIDING THAT THE CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LED TO HONG KONG'S DYNAMISM CONTINUE. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CONSIDERABLE AUTONOMY, STABILITY, AND PROSPERITY; THE PRESENCE OF A FREE MARKET SYSTEM; A FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD BUSINESS; THE RULE OF LAW, ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROTECTION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS; CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN, ACCOUNTABLE, AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS; AND COOPERATION BETWEEN HONG KONG AND FOREIGN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE UNITED STATES HAS AREAS OF CONCERN BUT IS HOPEFUL THAT THESE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET.
373	NATIONAL SPORTS ARE HIGHLY VALUED THROUGHOUT ASIA, YET, POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS IMPEDE THE EXPANSION OF THE SPORT SYSTEM LANDSCAPE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ON ASIAN SPORTING PERFORMANCE. TO ACCOMPLISH SO, WE ANALYZED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY LAW, AND NATIONAL SPORTS PERFORMANCE FROM 1998 TO 2018 WHILE CONTROLLING FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE ESTIMATORS WERE UTILIZED TO EXAMINE THE DATA. NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN POLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND NATIONAL SPORTS PERFORMANCE IN THE ASIAN COUNTRIES UNDER EXAMINATION, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY'S FINDINGS. THE PAPER INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND POLICYMAKERS.
374	IN THIS ESSAY, WE SUGGEST PRACTICAL WAYS TO SHIFT THE FRAMING OF CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE TOWARD DISABILITY JUSTICE. WE ELABORATE ON THE VISION STATEMENT PROVIDED IN THE 2010 INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE (NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE) "SUMMARY OF GUIDANCE FOR ESTABLISHING CRISIS STANDARDS OF CARE FOR USE IN DISASTER SITUATIONS," WHICH EMPHASIZES FAIRNESS; EQUITABLE PROCESSES; COMMUNITY AND PROVIDER ENGAGEMENT, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION; AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE ARGUE THAT INTERPRETING THESE ELEMENTS THROUGH DISABILITY JUSTICE ENTAILS A COMMITMENT TO BOTH DISTRIBUTIVE AND RECOGNITIVE JUSTICE. THE DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT'S DEMAND "NOTHING ABOUT US, WITHOUT US" REQUIRES SUBSTANTIVE INCLUSION OF DISABLED PEOPLE IN DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO THEIR INTERESTS, INCLUDING IN CRISIS PLANNING BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER A PANDEMIC LIKE COVID-19.
375	CHINA REVISED ITS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW (EPL) IN APRIL 2014. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE MAIN CHANGES AND CHALLENGES OF THE REVISED EPL IN LIGHT OF THE FIVE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSITIONS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN CHINA: (1) ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POWERED PRIMARILY BY INDUSTRIALISATION, (2) MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC REFORM, (3) SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POWERED PRIMARILY BY URBANISATION, (4) TRANSITION TO AN INFORMATION SOCIETY POWERED BY DIGITAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND (5) POLITICAL REFORM TO STRENGTHEN RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES EACH TRANSITION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE REVISED EPL, AS WELL AS THE INTERTWINED NATURE OF THE FIVE TRANSITIONS AND THEIR OVERALL IMPLICATIONS. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES RELATED LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS AFTER THE REVISION OF THE EPL, INCLUDING THE REVISION OF THE LEGISLATION LAW IN MARCH 2015.
376	ORIGINALISM IS A SUBJECT OF BOTH LEGAL AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE, INVOKED NOT JUST IN LAW REVIEW SCHOLARSHIP BUT ALSO IN POPULAR MEDIA AND PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THIS ESSAY PRESENTS THE FIRST EMPIRICAL STUDY OF PUBLIC ATTITUDES ABOUT ORIGINALISM. THE STUDY ANALYZES ORIGINAL AND EXISTING SURVEY DATA IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, LEGAL VIEWS, POLITICAL ORIENTATION, AND CULTURAL PROFILE OF THOSE WHO SELF-IDENTIFY, AS ORIGINALISTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT RULE OF LAW CONCERNS, SUPPORT FOR POLITICALLY CONSERVATIVE ISSUE POSITIONS, AND A CULTURAL ORIENTATION TOWARD MORAL TRADITIONALISM AND LIBERTARIANISM ARE ALL SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF AN INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCE FOR ORIGINALISM. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT ORIGINALISM HAS CURRENCY NOT ONLY AS A LEGAL PROPOSITION ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION, BUT ALSO AS A POLITICAL COMMODITY AND AS A CULTURALLY EXPRESSIVE IDIOM.
377	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS RECENT AMENDMENTS AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO AUSTRALIAN LAW, ALLOWING POLICE TO CONDUCT A SEARCH OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN PRESCRIBED CASES WITHOUT THE NEED TO SHOW 'REASONABLE SUSPICION'. SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND WAS RECENTLY THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION IN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS, AS IT WAS AT THAT STAGE. IT IS ARGUED THAT. SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE COURT SHOULD FIND SUCH LEGISLATION TO BE CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO DUE PROCESS. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXTENT TO WHICH INTERNATIONAL LAW IS AND SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN APPLYING AUSTRALIAN LAW, IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPRESS HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES.
378	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES A POTENTIAL LINK BETWEEN THE MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP AND COMPETITION POLICY. IT ANALYZES HOW A COUNTRY'S COMPETITION POLICY RELATES TO THE TRANSITION PROCESS FROM THE MIDDLE-INCOME STAGE TO THE HIGH-INCOME STAGE, AND WHAT FEATURES OF COMPETITION POLICY ARE ACCOMPANYING A COUNTRY'S SUCCESSFUL LEAP FROM THE MIDDLE-INCOME GROUP OF COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT TO AVOID FALLING INTO THE MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP, A COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE AN APPROPRIATE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, WHICH INCLUDES RIGOROUS ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, HIGH REGULATORY QUALITY, AND HIGH GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE COMPETITION POLICY AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE FOR COUNTRIES IN THE UPPER MIDDLE-INCOME STAGE. THE QUALITY OF COMPETITION LAW AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COMPETITION AUTHORITY MUST BE GUARANTEED.
379	THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF INFORMAL POLITICAL COALITIONS ON CHINA'S PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THEORETICALLY, THE PARTY-STATE CLIENTS OF CHINA'S SUPREME LEADERS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE STRONGER INCENTIVES TO FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH. ONE WAY OF DOING SO IS TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT BY REDUCING ITS POLITICAL RISKS. ANALYSIS OF PROVINCIAL-LEVEL PANEL DATA FROM 1993 TO 2017 SHOWS THAT PERSONAL CONNECTIONS-BASED ON SHARED EXPERIENCE IN THE SAME WORK UNIT-BETWEEN PROVINCIAL LEADERS AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S INCUMBENT SUPREME LEADER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE GROWTH RATE OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONS MAY ASSIST THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S PRIVATE ECONOMY BY PARTIALLY COMPENSATING FOR THE WEAKNESSES OF FORMAL RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS.
380	THERE ARE ALREADY A NUMBER OF GOOD ACCOUNTS OF THE IMPACT OF THE RECENT 2008-2014 ECONOMIC CRISIS ON EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES. HOWEVER, NO SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENTS OF HOW IT HAS AFFECTED SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY HAVE SO FAR BEEN CARRIED OUT. WE EXPLORE ITS IMPACT ON EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES IN SEVERAL AREAS BY ADOPTING THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY' FRAMEWORK. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE MEASURES WE EMPLOY CAPTURE THE VARIATION IN QUALITY DURING THIS TROUBLED' PERIOD. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT A SHRINKING OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC RESOURCES DUE TO AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN PROMPTS THREE REACTIONS: (A) A GENERAL DETERIORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW; (B) CITIZENS BECOME MORE SENSITIVE ABOUT WHAT GOVERNMENTS DELIVER; AND (C) DETACHMENT FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS OF REPRESENTATION ALONG WITH A CHOICE TO PROTEST.
381	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF TECHNICAL RESERVES IN THE INCOME SMOOTHING BEHAVIOR OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST ATTEMPTS IN THE LITERATURE TO TRACE SUCH RELATIONSHIP IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, ESPECIALLY AT A MULTI-COUNTRY SETTING. THE EXPERIENCE OF 770 INSURANCE FIRMS OPERATING IN 87 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2009 REVEALS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF INCOME SMOOTHING. THE PAPER ALSO FINDS THAT INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, E.G., THE RULE OF LAW, COMMON LAW LEGAL ORIGIN, ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO TECHNICAL PROVISIONS AND SUPERVISORY POWER CONSTRAIN INCOME SMOOTHING BUT OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF PROVISIONS, AUDITING, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

382	THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY GROWTH-CONDUCIVE INSTITUTIONS UNIQUE TO EMERGING ECONOMIES. FOR THAT PURPOSE, WE EXAMINE THE ROLES OF ANGLO-AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS IN FOSTERING TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH THROUGH THE IMPROVEMENT OF TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. SPECIFICALLY, THE IMPACTS OF THE LIBERALISTIC AND PATERNALISTIC TYPES OF REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS ARE DISCERNED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES SUCH AS REVERENCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENTS ROBUSTLY PROMOTE TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY BY IMPROVING TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY, WHILE VOICES OF CITIZENS AND POLITICAL STABILITY EXHIBIT A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP, WHERE THE EFFICACY OF ONE OF THESE QUALITIES REQUIRES THE SUFFICIENT PREVALENCE OF ANOTHER. REGARDING REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CALLS FOR PROTECTIONIST POLICIES TO FOSTER INNOVATION, WHICH IS THE KEY DRIVER OF TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY.
383	THE REVELATION THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEPARATED IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AT THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER AND PLACED THEM IN DETENTION FACILITIES SPARKED PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2018. WHILE THE POLICY RECEIVED SWIFT BACKLASH FROM THE PUBLIC AND WAS WIDELY DERIDED AS RUNNING COUNTER TO AMERICAN VALUES AND THE RULE OF LAW, A SEGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE POLICY. WE ARGUE THAT ETHNOCULTURAL FORMS OF NATIONALISM-BELIEFS ABOUT RELIGIOUS, ETHNIC, AND GENDERED CRITERIA FOR "TRUE AMERICANNESS"-HELP EXPLAIN SUPPORT FOR FAMILY SEPARATIONS. WE TEST THIS ARGUMENT USING TWO SURVEYS COLLECTED 2 YEARS APART. IN BOTH DATA SETS, WE FIND SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT ETHNOCULTURAL FORMS OF NATIONALISM ARE LINKED TO SUPPORT FOR FAMILY SEPARATION, WHILE GENERALIZED NATIONALISM IS NOT.
384	IN THIS PAPER, WE ARE INTERESTED IN ASSESSING THE GREEK PROTECTED AREAS' (PAS) OPERATION, AND IN PARTICULAR, TO WHAT EXTENT THE STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGED IN THEIR MANAGEMENT CONSIDER THAT THE "GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE" CRITERIA ARE MET. THROUGH THE USE OF Q-METHODOLOGY, WE FIND THAT, DESPITE THE VERY DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH PA, THE STAKEHOLDERS' VIEWS CLUSTER AROUND FOUR DISTINCTIVE MAIN PERSPECTIVES (OR FACTORS). FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT STAKEHOLDERS DO NOT CONSIDER, OVERALL, THAT THE GREEK PAS MANAGEMENT STRONGLY MEETS ANY OF THE "GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE" CRITERIA, WITH PARTICULARLY POOR ASSESSMENTS ON CRUCIAL GOVERNANCE ASPECTS SUCH AS A SHARED VISION GUIDING THE PA MANAGEMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS/EFFICIENCY OF THE PROCEDURES, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE OF GREEK PAS IS SUBOPTIMAL AT LEAST.
385	THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT COURTS ARE NOT ONLY A CRUCIAL PART OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE, BUT THAT THEY CAN ALSO SERVE AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN REVEALING INFORMATION TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF LOWER LEVEL GOVERNMENTS. WHEN COURTS FUNCTION IN THIS INFORMATIVE WAY, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF LOWER LEVEL GOVERNMENTS. AFTER DEVELOPING A GENERAL ARGUMENT IN THAT VEIN, THE RECENT REFORMS TO THE CHINESE COURT SYSTEM ARE PARTIALLY INTERPRETED AS AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE COURTS MONITORING AGENTS FOR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. BASED ON PRIMARY DATA FROM MORE THAN 1000 CHINESE LOCAL COURTS, THE ARGUMENT IS TESTED EMPIRICALLY AND ITS HYPOTHESES ARE LARGELY CONFIRMED.(C) 2022 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
386	THE TEXT SHOWS DATA TAKEN FROM SURVEYS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELITES OF EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA AND NICARAGUA FROM THE 1900S TO 2017 ON ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL ACTORS, THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTIES, PARTIES WITH WHICH COMPETE, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE MARKET IN THEIR COUNTRIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE WORK IS TO ANALYZE THE PERCEPTIONS OF HOW DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAVE EVOLVED IN EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA AND NICARAGUA, WHICH WERE BORN AS NEW DEMOCRACIES IN A CONTEXT OF CRISIS AND WAR. THE CENTRAL ISSUES ON WHICH THE ARTICLE DEALS ARE TWO: THE DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN EL SALVADOR, THE FRAGILE DEMOCRATIC PERMANENCE IN GUATEMALA AND THE DE-DEMOCRATIZATION IN NICARAGUA, AND THE DIFFICULT RECONCILIATION BETWEEN POLITICAL ACTORS IN POST-CONFLICT CONTEXTS.
387	THE MAIN PURPOSE OF CONDUCTING WIDESPREAD SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS MONITORING COMMUNICATIONS VIA TELECOMMUNICATIONS, RETAINING INTERNET CONNECTION RECORDS, AND PLACING CAMERAS IN PUBLIC AREAS IS TO PREVENT INCREASING TERRORIST INCIDENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND TURKEY BOTH. THE SAFEGUARDS FOR THE RIGHT TO RESPECT FOR PRIVATE LIFE WHICH ARE STIPULATED BY SURVEILLANCE LAWS SHOULD BE PRO-PORTIONATE AND SHOULD PREVENT ARBITRARINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS SENSE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS FOR SECURITY SERVIES SHOULD ALSO BE OPERATED IN A DEMOCRATIC AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. THIS STUDY, WHICH WILL EMPHASISE THE SIMILAR, DIFFERENT AND INCOMPLETE ASPECTS OF SURVEILLANCE REGIMES IN THE UK AND TURKEY, AIMS TO PRESENT THE FRAGILE BALANCE BETWEEN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERROR AND THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE LIFE.
388	THE STABILITY OF THE GLOBAL ORDER IS A FUNCTION OF THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN UNIVERSAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND POWER ASYMMETRIES. BOTH PRINCIPLES AND POWER ARE EMBEDDED IN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AS RELATIVE POWER SHIFTS AWAY FROM THE WEST, THE ABILITY OF THE LATTER TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THE REACH OF GLOBAL NORMS-ON HUMAN RIGHTS, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE, THE RULE OF LAW, THE USE OF FORCE, THE POSSESSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS-WILL LESSEN. THEY WILL HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE NEW NORMAL EITHER BY BRINGING THEIR CONDUCT WITHIN THE OPERATION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMATIVE INSTRUMENTS, OR ELSE RISK MASS DEFECTIONS FROM GLOBAL REGIMES. THE RELATIVE LOSS OF POWER MEANS THEY HAVE A MATERIAL INTEREST IN STRENGTHENING, NOT WEAKENING, A RULES-BASED GLOBAL ORDER.
389	THE PAPER IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE SECTIONS: 1) PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE MEMORY AFTER AUSCHWITZ TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT RETURNING TO THE PAST, SO PRUDENTLY LOOK TO THE FUTURE IN THE RULE OF LAW. 2) STUDY OF THE CONSENSUS AND LANGUAGE AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST AS AN OVERRATED CONCEPT, BUT ALSO AS A NECESSARY ELEMENT TO DETERMINE THE LAW. 3) THE STARTING POINT IS THE CONSENSUS AFTER THE POSTWAR PERIOD SET IN THE CONTEXT OF HATE SPEECH. IT INTENDS TO JUSTIFY THE DENIAL OF HOLOCAUST AS A WAY TO RECONCILE WITH OUR PAST. 4) RETHINKING MEMORY TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW ACROSS THE PAST, AND ACCOMPLISH A REASONABLE PRESENT AND AUTHENTIC FUTURE. 5) FINALLY, THE LAST PART INDICATES SOME CONCLUSIONS.
390	ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENT THE SPINAL CORD OF THE ECONOMY OF A COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO STATISTICAL DATA IN THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, THESE ENTERPRISES INCLUDE 99% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ACTIVE ENTERPRISES, ALTHOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS NOT SEEN ONLY FROM THEIR PRESENCE IN THIS TOTAL. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS INITIATIVES, THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA SHOULD PROVIDE A FAVORABLE, FRIENDLY BUSINESS CLIMATE - WHICH MEANS GOOD PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF CONTRACTS, RULE OF LAW, QUALITATIVE AND NON-ARBITRARY REGULATION, STABLE AND PREDICTABLE GOVERNMENT POLICY, FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, ELIMINATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC BARRIERS, FAVORABLE TAX POLICY PROVISIONS FOR THIS TYPE OF INVESTMENT, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BROAD ABSORPTION POWER OF THE MARKET.
391	THIS WORK ANALYSES THE CONCEPT OF TRIBUTE AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE CONFORMING ELEMENTS, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH THE BRAZILIAN AND SPANISH LEGAL SYSTEMS, ALSO GOING THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES WHICH MUST GUIDE ITS IMPLEMENTATION, SPECIALLY THE ABILITY TO PAY PRINCIPLE, NOT OBSERVED BY LEGISLATION IN A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS, NEITHER CLOSELY IMPOSED BY COURTS AS REQUIRED. FURTHERMORE, IT GOES THROUGH A DETAINED ANALYSIS OF THE PHENOMENON OF NONFISCAL TAXATION WHICH HAS HAD AN INCREASINGLY BROAD USE IN ALL TAX SYSTEMS. THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY INTENDS TO PRESENT THE SIMILARITIES AND DIVERSITIES IN APPROACHING A FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW SO AS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENRICHMENT OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THROUGH THE LOOK OF THE OTHER OVER A DIVERSE CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT.
392	IN THE RECENT 40 YEARS, AROUND 90 COUNTRIES HAVE TRIED - WITH MORE OR LESS SUCCESS - TO MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR AUTOCRATIC PAST AND TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO DEMOCRACY. IN 2011, QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY, SUCH A CHANCE AROSE FOR WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING EGYPT AND TUNISIA. THE AUTHOR PRESENTS THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL DRAFTING WHICH IS MOST DESIRABLE FOR THOSE COUNTRIES, MUSLIM AND ARABIC AT THE SAME TIME. FOR THIS PURPOSE HE ALSO EXAMINES THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SUNNI ISLAM, THE LEVEL OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC SITUATION AND THE STATE OF POLITICAL ELITES. NEVERTHELESS, THE AUTHOR FOCUSES HIS ATTENTION ON THE MODEL OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN BOTH COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE STARTING POINT AND THE COURSE OF TRANSITION.
393	THE MONITORING OF ELECTIONS BY INTERNATIONAL GROUPS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD. BUT CAN IT HAVE UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR GOVERNANCE? WE ARGUE THAT HIGH-QUALITY ELECTION MONITORING, BY PREVENTING CERTAIN FORMS OF MANIPULATION SUCH AS STUFFING BALLOT BOXES, CAN UNWITTINGLY INDUCE INCUMBENTS TO RESORT TO TACTICS OF ELECTION MANIPULATION THAT ARE MORE DAMAGING TO DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNANCE, AND FREEDOMS. THESE TACTICS INCLUDE RIGGING COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES AND REPRESSING THE MEDIA. WE USE AN ORIGINAL-PANEL DATASET OF 144 COUNTRIES IN 1990-2007 TO TEST OUR ARGUMENT. WE FIND THAT, ON AVERAGE, HIGH-QUALITY ELECTION MONITORING HAS A MEASURABLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE RULE OF LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE PERFORMANCE, AND MEDIA FREEDOM. WE EMPLOY VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO GUARD AGAINST ENDOGENEITY, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTING FOR ELECTION MONITORING.
394	THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DETERMINE VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF INCOMING CROSS-BORDER M&AS IN EUROPEAN TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES. DYNAMIC PANEL MODELS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED USING ARELLANO AND BOND GMM ESTIMATOR FOR PERIOD BETWEEN YEAR 1994 AND 2008. THE RATIO OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF CROSS-BORDER M&A TO GDP OF THE COUNTRY IS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INCLUDE FOLLOWING INDICATORS: LAGGED VALUE OF CROSS-BORDER M&A TO GDP, LAGGED GDP PER CAPITA, LAGGED GDP GROWTH, INFLATION, INTEREST RATE SPREAD, LAGGED PRIVATE CREDIT TO GDP RATIO, MARKET CAPITALIZATION TO GDP RATIO, LAGGED RULE OF LAW AND LAGGED CONTROL OF CORRUPTION.

395	POLICY IN THE LAW IS SAID TO BE AN UNRULY HORSE. THE CONCEPT REQUIRES DEFINITION. IT MAY REFER TO NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES INFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE COMMON LAW. IN THE CONTEXT OF STATUTE LAW IT USUALLY REFERS TO THE PURPOSE SAID TO BE SERVED BY A STATUTE IN JUSTIFICATION OF CONSTRUCTIONAL CHOICES AND THE APPLICATION OF BROADLY STATED LEGAL RULES AND STANDARDS. NOT ALL STATUTES ARE INFORMED BY COHERENT POLICY. SOME REFLECT CONFLICTING POLICIES ARISING OUT OF POLITICAL COMPROMISES. NEVER THE LESS, CONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION WHETHER A STATUTE IS INFORMED BY A POLICY AND IF SO WHAT THAT POLICY IS, IS AN INESCAPABLE PART OF ITS CONSTRUCTION AND APPLICATION. IN THIS SENSE POLICY IS A HELPFUL GUARDIAN OF THE RULE OF LAW.
396	THE AUTHOR ASSESSES THE RELEVANCE AND ANALYTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM AND INTERPRETS IT AS ONE OF THE MODERN CONCEPTUAL MODELS OF ORDOLIBERALISM AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM AND ORDOLIBERALISM EMPHASISE THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE AUTHORITARIANISM OF THE STRONG STATE AND THE ECONOMIC LIBERALISM OF MARKET RATIONALITY. AS A FLEXIBLE MARKET-ORIENTED FORM OF AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM, ORDOLIBERALISM MEANS A RATIONAL STRATEGY FOR MAINTAINING AND PROMOTING THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROJECT TOWARDS WHICH THE MARKET ECONOMY AND THE TECHNOCRATIC ELITE ARE MOVING TO CONTAIN CRISES. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE VALUES OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM, PLURALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, AUTHORITARIANISM IN THIS STRUCTURE IS NOT REPRESSIVE OR MONOCENTRIC, BUT SUBJECT TO DEMOCRATIC CRITICISM IN RELATION TO THE SUPRANATIONAL REGULATION
397	THROUGH THE PRESENTATION OF THE HISTORY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE IN GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONAL DISCOURSE, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT, ALTHOUGH IN COLOMBIA THERE IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONALIZED PURPOSE OR PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE MODERN NOTION OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE, ALSO CALLED SOCIAL JUSTICE TODAY, IS IMPLICIT IN THE CONSTITUTION OF 1991 BECAUSE IT ENSHRINED AS MANDATORY RULES THE THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF ITS MEANING AT THE TIME OF ITS PROMULGATION: THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE RIGHT TO A MATERIAL EQUALITY. THUS, IN COLOMBIA SOCIAL JUSTICE MUST NOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE ARISTOTELIAN SENSE OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE BUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE THREE ELEMENTS, AND CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED IF THEY ARE FULFILLED.
398	IN INDIA THE CONCEPT OF CIVIL JUSTICE IS NOT NEW. IT HAS EXISTED SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. A LARGE NUMBER OF RELATED PROVISIONS ARE FOUND IN MANU, WHO COMPILED THE THEN EXISTING JUSTICE SYSTEM IN INDIA OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO IN HIS FOURTEEN-VOLUME WORK TITLED MANAVA DHARMA SHASTRA. THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE IS ALSO FOUND IN DETAIL IN THE VEDAS, WHICH ARE FROM A VERY ANCIENT TIME. IN BOTH THESE SCRIPTURES THE RULE OF LAW WAS ADEQUATELY PROVIDED. TODAY, HOWEVER, THE INDIAN CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM RESEMBLES ITS COMMON LAW COUNTERPARTS. IT FEATURES A COORDINATED, PYRAMID STRUCTURE OF JUDICIAL AUTHORITY, EMPHASIZING FORMAL PROCEDURAL JUSTICE DOMINATED BY LITIGANTS OF EQUAL STATUS ENGAGED IN ADVERSARIAL PROCESSES, AND PROVIDES BINDING, WIN-LOSE REMEDIES.
399	THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF POSSIBLE STRUCTURES FOR REGULATORY REGIMES IN COUNTRIES. ! IS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ANALYSIS OF MULTI-PURPOSE REGULATORS THAT COMBINE REGULATORY AND ANTITRUST POWERS, SUCH AS THE MEXICAN IFT AND COFECE, AS WELL AS THE SPANISH CNMC. WE FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, REVIEW THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON THE PROS AND CONS OF SINGLE-PURPOSE VS. MULTI-PURPOSE REGULATORS, AND USE THE NEW SPANISH AND THE MEXICAN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS TO CONTRAST HOW SUCH PROS AND CONS ARE DESIGNED TO OPERATE ON PAPER AND HOW THEY DO SO IN REAL LIFE. OUR GOAL IS TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE, AT THE VERY INITIAL STAGE OF THE REFORMS IN BOTH THESE COUNTRIES, OF WHETHER THESE COUNTRIES ARE MOVING CLOSER TO A RULE OF LAW EQUILIBRIUM.
400	THE PRESENT ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RECENT ADVANCES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE "RESOURCE CURSE" IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. BY ANALYZING THE RULE OF LAW INDEX, WE INVESTIGATED HOW THE INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING HYDROCARBON ROYALTIES CAN HELP MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF THE RESOURCE CURSE. WE USED A QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY BASED ON CASE STUDIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EVIDENCE OF LEGAL VIOLATIONS ON THE PART OF THESE INSTITUTIONS AND THE LACK OF TOOLS IN RESOURCE-RICH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO UPHOLD BASIC SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESOURCE CURSE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT STRENGTHENING THE INSTITUTIONS, CLOSER MONITORING OF OIL REVENUE ALLOCATIONS, AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CAN HELP TO ALLEVIATE THE RESOURCE CURSE. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD.

401	AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS OFTEN HAILED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. SECURING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE (JI) VIA EXPLICIT CONSTITUTIONAL RULES SEEMS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT DE JURE AND DE FACTO JI ARE LINKED, AT LEAST IN THE LONG TERM. HOWEVER, THE REALIZED DEGREE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OFTEN DIVERGES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED ONE. BASED ON A WORLDWIDE PANEL DATASET FROM 1950 TO 2018, WE FIND THAT A NEGATIVE GAP, THAT IS, WHEN DE JURE JI > DE FACTO JI, IS VERY COMMON. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASING GAP ARE THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS AND THE EXTENT OF PRESS FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY, WHEREAS CORRUPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASING GAP BETWEEN DE JURE JI AND DE FACTO JI.
402	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES EMPIRICALLY WHETHER FIRM OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES CONTRIBUTE TO VARYING LEVELS OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE, WHICH ULTIMATELY INFLUENCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF WINNING A LAWSUIT. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE EMPLOYMENT LAWSUITS BECAUSE THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE COMPANY IS RARELY ESTABLISHED. USING COLLECTED 2756 EMPLOYMENT JUDGMENTS DECIDED BY DISTRICT COURTS IN BEIJING BETWEEN 2014 AND 2018, I TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS AGAINST THREE OTHER TYPES OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES IN CHINA: STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, WHOLLY FOREIGN- FUNDED COMPANIES, AND PARTLY FOREIGN-FUNDED COMPANIES. THE STATISTICAL RESULT CONFIRMS THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE CASES, THUS SUPPORTING THE PROPOSED HYPOTHESIS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S SCALE AND THE COMPANY'S LIFE SPAN ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE EMPLOYMENT LAWSUIT RESULT.
403	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF CHINA'S OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI) ACTIVITIES WITH GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION (GMS) COUNTRIES, NAMELY, CAMBODIA, LAO, MYANMAR, VIETNAM, AND THAILAND DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2007 AND 2016. WE ESTABLISHED THE BAYESIAN PANEL DATA APPROACH COMBINATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT A HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, AND POLITICAL STABILITY TEND TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING CHINESE OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, HIGHER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, INFLATION RATES, RULE OF LAW, AND BUSINESS FREEDOM TENDS TO DECREASE THE PROBABILITY OF BEING A RECIPIENT OF CHINESE OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT ONLY ASSESSED ECONOMIC VARIABLES, THE INNOVATION OF THIS STUDY LIES IN ITS INCLUSION OF SOCIO-POLITICAL VARIABLES.
404	WE EXAMINE THE GLOBAL DETERMINANTS OF THE ILLICIT INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS TRADE AND THE SPECIFIC ROLES THAT STATES PLAY IN IT, A TOPIC UNDERSTUDIED BY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SCHOLARS. WE DEVELOP THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL DATA SET OF STATE INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING AND THEN USE THE DATA SET TO EMPIRICALLY TEST HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE LIKELIHOOD OF COUNTRIES TO SERVE AS TRANSIT STATES FOR THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF ILLICIT DRUGS. WE FIND THAT MORE-GLOBALIZED COUNTRIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACT AS TRANSIT STATES AND THAT THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS STATE CORRUPTION AND A WEAK RULE OF LAW, ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE PROBABILITY OF ACTING AS A TRANSIT STATE. STATES WITH A MORE STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE TRANSIT STATES.
405	RECENT SCHOLARSHIP ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CONDITIONALITY ON DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IN A CONTRADICTORY WAY. ON ONE HAND, THE EU IS PERCEIVED AS A KEY AGENT OF SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AND ON OTHER HAND, THE RETURN OF NATIONALIST AND POPULIST POLITICS IN NEW MEMBER STATES HAS BEEN EXPLORED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE HASTY ACCESSION THAT UNDERMINED GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSTRAINED PUBLIC DEBATE OVER POLICY ALTERNATIVES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THIS PUZZLE OF THE AMBIGUOUS EFFECTS OF THE EU'S POLITICS OF CONDITIONALITY, WHICH PROMOTED INSTITUTIONS STABILIZING THE HORIZONTAL DIVISION OF POWERS, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN AND MINORITY RIGHTS PROTECTION, BUT WHICH NEGLECTED NORMS AND RULES OF PARTICIPATORY AND/OR POPULAR DEMOCRACY.
406	IN THIS PAPER I ANALYZE THE TRUMP, PUTIN, AND ZUMA REGIMES AS "THUGOCRACIES": PROJECTS OF SOPHISTICATED STATE CAPTURE, THROUGH ORGANIZED CRIME NETWORKS AT EVERY LEVEL OF SCALE, AND UTILIZING COMPLEX ARRAYS OF MAFIA TACTICS, PERSONNEL, AND PRACTICES. WITH A BASIS IN FIRST-HAND ETHNOGRAPHY ON THE MODALITIES OF THE MAFIA IN RUSSIA IN THE 1990S, I DELINEATE CRITICAL INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THUGOCRATS OPERATING IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AND THE UNITED STATES, ARGUING THAT THEIR NETWORKS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY LOCAL, EXTENSIVELY TRANSNATIONAL, AND CLOSELY INTERTWINED. THOUGH THUGOCRATIC REGIMES TARGET THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN ORDER TO "MAKE CRIME LEGAL," I CONCLUDE THAT INQUIRIES LIKE THE SOUTH AFRICAN ZONDO COMMISSION HELP CREATE PUBLIC OUTRAGE AND AWARENESS OF THE THREAT THUGOCRACY POSES TO DEMOCRACY.
407	EUROPEAN IMMIGRATION AND REFUGE POLICIES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THOSE WHO SEE THEM AS EMBLEMS OF A CONCEPTION THAT PUTS IN SERIOUS RISK BASIC ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EVEN OF DEMOCRACY. THE EPITOME IS THE EMERGENCE OF SLAVE MARKETS IN LIBYA (AT THE GATES OF THE EU), A FAILED STATE THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES ARE DETERMINED TO RAISE TO THE STATUS OF PRIVILEGED PARTNER OF THEIR OUTSOURCING POLICIES. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF LOCHAK, AGAMBEM AND BAUMAN AND THE CONCEPTION OF THE <NECROPOLITICS> PROPOSED BY THE CAMEROONIAN PHILOSOPHER MBEMBE WHO DEVELOPS FOUCAULT'S THESIS ABOUT BIOPOLITICS, THIS TEXT WILL PROPOSE SOME ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE LEADED BY THE REQUIREMENT OF RECOGNITION AND GUARANTEE OF RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.
408	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT CHINA'S INVOLVEMENT IN CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES UNDERMINES THE DEMOCRACY PROMOTION EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES. FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT CHINA DOES INDEED CHALLENGE WESTERN EFFORTS, BUT IN AN INDIRECT WAY. FIRST, CHINESE PROVISION OF SUBSTANTIAL AND UNCONDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MAKES WESTERN POLITICALLY CONDITIONED AID APPEAR BOTH UNGENEROUS AND AN INFRINGEMENT OF SOVEREIGNTY. SECOND, THE SHANGHAI CO-OPERATION ORGANISATION, INCLUSIVE OF CHINA'S LEADERSHIP ROLE, CREATES AN INSTITUTIONAL MEANS THROUGH WHICH THE (SEMI-)AUTHORITARIANISM OF MEMBER STATES IS LEGITIMIZED AND CHALLENGES WESTERN EMPHASIS ON DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. FINALLY, BY THE POWER OF ITS OWN EXAMPLE, CHINA DEMONSTRATES THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT A PREREQUISITE FOR PROSPERITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING.
409	THIS ARTICLE FIRST DISCUSSES THE OVERALL THEME OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW FROM A LEGAL THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE, NAMELY, THE CONCEPT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF STATES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT CONCLUDES THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF STATES EXIST IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AS AUTONOMOUS JURIDICAL PRINCIPLES. THE ARTICLE THEN PROCEEDS TO DISCUSS ONE SUCH ASSERTED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF STATES: THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL NUCLEAR ENERGY, AS CODIFIED IN THE 1968 NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY. IT ARGUES THAT THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL NUCLEAR ENERGY IS INDEED A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF STATES, AND THAT IT HAS JURIDICAL SUBSTANCE, AND CARRIES JURIDICAL IMPLICATIONS, AS A RULE OF LAW ON PAR WITH OTHER RULES OF THE JUS DISPOSITIVUM.
410	BUILDING ON RECENT WORKS SHOWING THE ROLE THAT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS CAN PLAY IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN CAPITAL (JENSEN 2003, 2006; LI AND RESNICK 2003; LI 2006; BIGLAISER AND STAATS 2010; STAATS AND BIGLAISER 2012), AND DRAWING ON INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM POWELL AND RICKARD (2010), WE USE PANEL DATA FOR 114 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 1970 TO 2007 TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS ATTRACT GREATER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) THAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CIVIL LAW OR ISLAMIC LEGAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE COMMON LAW SYSTEMS ARE MORE INCLINED TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CAN BE UNDERSTOOD TO PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENCY IN THE LAW, BETTER CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, MORE JUDICIAL AUTONOMY, AND MORE MARKET-ORIENTED REGULATIONS.
411	THE MARCH 2014 REFERENDUM IN THE CRIMEA STANDS IN THE TRADITION OF NUMEROUS TERRITORIAL REFERENDUMS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD IN EASTERN EUROPE OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS IN PARTICULAR. ALLOCATING TERRITORY BY DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES WITH DUE CONSIDERATION OF THE WILL OF THE AFFECTED POPULATIONS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. BUT IF SUCH PROCESSES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW, THEN THEY ARE BETTER FOR REALIZING A CHANGE IN TERRITORIAL STATUS THAN ALL OF THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES. IN THE CRIMEA, HOWEVER, ELEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL RULES FOR CONDUCTING A TERRITORIAL REFERENDUM WERE VIOLATED. THEREFORE, THE REFERENDUM IS IRRELEVANT UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS REFERENDUM WAS A COMEDIE PLEBISCITAIRE TO DISGUISE THE MILITARY OCCUPATION OF THE CRIMEAN PENINSULA AND ITS SUBSEQUENT ANNEXATION BY RUSSIA.
412	THE RISE OF JOKO WIDODO (JOKOWI) FROM SMALL-TOWN MAYOR TO PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER ASKS AGAIN WHETHER NEW, ALTERNATIVE LEADERS COULD ENTER INDONESIAN POLITICS IN THE 2014 ELECTIONS. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS JOKOWI'S IMPACT ON INDONESIAN POLITICS OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND EXAMINES WHETHER HIS ELECTION AS JAKARTA GOVERNOR, AND HIS EVIDENT POPULARITY, HAS OPENED THE WAY FOR ALTERNATIVE CANDIDATES AT LOCAL LEVEL, OR IF IT HAS CHANGED PARTIES' CALCULATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING WHETHER A NEW LEADER COULD TACKLE SOME OF THE ENTRENCHED DEFECTS OF DEMOCRACY IN INDONESIA, GIVEN THAT HE OR SHE MAY HAVE ONLY MINORITY SUPPORT IN THE PARLIAMENT. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR ON CORRUPT LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE MILITARY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND VIOLENT RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.
413	QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY CAN BE EVALUATED BY OBSERVING THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE THAT MOST IMPORTANT DIMENSION SUCH AS RULE OF LAW, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND A COMPETITIVE PARTY SYSTEM ARE CLOSELY INTERRELATED. THE STARTING POINT TO ANALYZE THE RELATION AMONG THESE CONCEPTS AND ITS IMPACT TO DEMOCRATIC QUALITY IS THE DIMENSION OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN ITS TWO VERSIONS. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS DEVELOPED IN EIGHT EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SHOWS WHICH FACTORS EXPLAIN THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. VARIATION AMONG REGIME TYPE ARE DUE TO THE HIGHER OR LOWER PRESENCE OF EACH DIMENSION, WITH WIDE POSSIBILITIES FOR DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS, AND THIS HELPS US TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HYBRID REGIMES.
414	USING THE GOAL OF A 10% REDUCTION OF SO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA'S 11TH FIVE-YEAR PLAN (2006-2010) AS A CASE STUDY, THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS ARE USED IN A LARGE COUNTRY WITH MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNMENTS AND INSUFFICIENT RULE OF LAW. AFTER THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SET UP THE GOAL, THE MITIGATION BURDEN WAS SHARED AMONG LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND MECHANISMS WERE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE GOAL. THIS PAPER FOUND THAT IN THE 11TH FIVE-YEAR PLAN, BOTH THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WERE MUCH MORE COMMITTED TO SO2 MITIGATION THAN PREVIOUSLY, WHICH COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN CHINA'S RECENT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SO2 EMISSIONS. THE CASE INDICATES THAT GOALS CAN EFFECTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND OTHER NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AGENDAS.
415	IN THIS PAPER, I REVISIT TWO CLASSIC WORKS - T. HOBBES' LEVIATHAN AND J. LOCKE'S SECOND TREATISE ON GOVERNMENT - TO SUGGEST THAT SUCH WORKS ALLOW US TO REINVIGORATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE AS AN INSTANCE OF POLITICAL REGULATION THAT IS BOTH PRESENT AND ABSENT, AS IN THE PERIPHERIES OF LARGE BRAZILIAN CITIES, ABOUT WHICH IT IS CUSTOMARY TO SAY THAT THE STATE IS PRESENT ONLY TO PUNISH. TO THINK ABOUT THIS SITUATION, HOBBES AND LOCKE OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE LEXICON IN VOGUE OF EXCEPTION, ALLOWING US TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THE FORM OF A PERMANENT TENSION - POLITICAL AND NOT LEGAL - BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE STATE OF WAR, A TENSION THAT IS BUILT UP AROUND THE RIGHT TO PUNISH.
416	THE VIEW THAT PARTICIPATION BY THE RESPONDENT STATE ENHANCES THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL OR ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN A DECISION NOT TO PARTICIPATE. SUCH A DECISION MAY BE PROMPTED BY POLITICAL RATHER THAN LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE OBJECT OF NONPARTICIPATION MAY BE TO FACILITATE EXERCISE OF A POLITICAL OPTION OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE JUDGMENT OR AWARD, NOTWITHSTANDING PRIOR AGREEMENT THAT IT IS LEGALLY BINDING. IF SO, THEN THE BASIC ISSUE IS NOT NONPARTICIPATION AS SUCH, BUT RATHER NONCOMPLIANCE WITH A LEGALLY BINDING AWARD OR JUDGMENT, AS WELL AS A LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENT TO ARBITRATE OR ADJUDICATE DISPUTES. THIS RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ROLE OF LEGITIMACY, AND INDEED THE RULE OF LAW, IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.
417	PROSPECTS FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME IN EU-TURKEY RELATIONS APPEAR SLIM: MEMBERSHIP NEGOTIATIONS ARE DE FACTO ON HOLD AND SOME MEMBER STATES AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT HAVE SUGGESTED A SUSPENSION GIVEN THE DETERIORATION IN THE AREA OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW AFTER THE 2016 COUP ATTEMPT. THE EU-TURKEY REFUGEE DEAL OF MARCH 2016 GENERATED OPTIMISM FOR A RELATIONSHIP RESET, THE INTENSIFICATION OF ACCESSION TALKS, AND A CLEAR PATH TO VISA LIBERALIZATION. HOWEVER, NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING AND AS SUCH, THE "MUDDLE THROUGH" SCENARIO REMAINS THE MOST LIKELY ONE. BEFORE PROGRESS CAN BE MADE ON ISSUES SUCH AS THE UPGRADING OF THE CUSTOMS UNION, EU MEMBER STATES WOULD WANT TO SEE SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
418	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE PATTERN OF SETTLEMENTS, INVESTOR WINS AND STATE WINS IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT CASES, FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT OF ARBITRATION RULES, THE RESOURCES AND EXPERIENCE OF THE LITIGANTS, THE TYPE OF TREATY BREACH UNDER INVESTIGATION, AND THE PATTERN OF STATE INTERVENTION. LOGISTIC REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT SETTLEMENTS ARE MORE LIKELY WHEN INVESTORS DO NOT DISCLOSE THEIR ALLEGATIONS PUBLICLY, WHEN THE HOST STATE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A GREATER NUMBER OF PAST CASES, AND WHEN THE RESPONDENT STATE HAS A HIGHER CONTROL-OF-CORRUPTION RATING. PANEL AWARDS TO INVESTORS ARE MORE LIKELY IN CASES OF ALLEGED DIRECT EXPROPRIATION AND LESS LIKELY FOR INDIRECT EXPROPRIATION. PANEL DECISIONS FAVORING THE STATE INCREASE WITH HIGHER PER CAPITA INCOME AND RULE-OF-LAW RATINGS.
419	THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT A LAW REFORM FRAMEWORK FOR FAMILY PROPERTY SETTLEMENTS, DRAWN EXPRESSLY FROM A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION. IT APPLIES RAWLS' THEORY OF JUSTICE, WHICH FALLS UNDER A LIBERAL PHILOSOPHICAL UMBRELLA. IT EXPLAINS THE CHOICE OF A LIBERAL THEORY FOR USE IN FAMILY PROPERTY SETTLEMENTS AND CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF RAWLS' THEORY OF JUSTICE. DRAWN FROM RAWLS' THEORY, FOUR FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES EMERGE. THESE ARE THE RULE OF LAW (INCLUDING TRANSPARENCY, CONSISTENCY, AND CLEAR PURPOSE), NON-DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN SPOUSES, RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL DISADVANTAGE, AND PRIORITY TO THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF CHILDREN. FROM THOSE PRINCIPLES, THIS ARTICLE CONSTRUCTS THE ELEMENTS OF A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE PROPERTY SETTLEMENT LAW COMBINING PRE-CONDITIONS TO A RULE OF EQUAL DIVISION WHILE RETAINING JUDICIAL DISCRETION FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES.
420	THE STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE ECONOMIC FREEDOMS SUCH AS REGULATORY EFFICIENCY, OPEN MARKETS AND LIMITED MARKETS, POLITICAL FREEDOM AND RULE OF LAW IN THE GROWTH OF THE GLOBAL MIDDLE CLASS THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN 34 EMERGING MARKETS DURING THE PERIOD OF 1994-2011. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT SOME DIMENSIONS OF FREEDOM ARE MORE CRITICAL THAN OTHERS IN MAKING THESE MARKETS ATTRACTIVE LOCATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND THIS IN TURN LEADS TO DOMESTIC GROWTH AND THUS GROWTH OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THE EXISTENCE OF A FEEDBACK LOOP, WHEREBY THE GROWING MIDDLE CLASS BECOMES A DRIVING FORCE FOR FURTHER" EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

421	THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMPLIED TERMS ON SHORT DELIVERY IS A COMPLEX STORY OF JUDICIAL AND ACADEMIC IGNORANCE OF LAW AND FACTS. SIR MACKENZIE CHALMERS' STATUTORY FORMULATION OF THE RIGHT TO CORRECT DELIVERY WAS THE SAME AS THAT PROVIDED IN JUDAH BENJAMIN'S 1868 WORK ON SALES. HOWEVER, BENJAMIN'S FORMULATION WAS FLAWED, WHICH LED TO A HIGHLY UNSATISFACTORY RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE HISTORY OF THE CASE LAW ON SHORT DELIVERY, LEADING UP TO THE 1893 CODIFICATION. THE OPERATION OF THE STATUTORY RULE FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE DEPTH OF CONFUSION WHICH REMAINED FOLLOWING CODIFICATION. A COMPARISON WITH THE HISTORY OF SHORT DELIVERY IN THE UNITED STATES DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CONFUSION WITHIN THE ENGLISH SYSTEM COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.
422	GUATEMALA IS UNDERGOING A PROCESS OF POLITICAL CHANGE. THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION FAILS TO CONSOLIDATE AS AUTHORITARIAN FEATURES STILL SURVIVE AND COEXIST WITH DEMOCRATIC RULES, RESULTING IN AN APPARENT STABILITY WHERE POLITICAL CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED FROM TRADITIONAL ACTORS (POLITICAL PARTIES, BUSINESS COMMUNITY) TO NEW EMERGING PLAYERS. THE AUTHORITARIAN FEATURES ROOTED IN THE STRUCTURES OF POWER, LOCAL AND NATIONAL, TOGETHER WITH A CAPITALIST ACCUMULATION THAT COMBINES ILLEGAL RESOURCES, A WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND INCREASING WEALTH GENERATED BY DOING BUSINESS WITH THE STATE, PROVIDE A SCENARIO OF PERMANENT CONFRONTATION. THIS CONFRONTATION IS NOT EASILY PERCEIVED, BUT IT IS REVEALED IN SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE VITAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE ARE VIOLATED, FEAR IS USED AS A RESOURCE FOR COLLECTIVE INACTION, AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE CONTROLLED.
423	DAVID BEN-GURION IS USUALLY CONSIDERED A LABOUR LEADER OR ZIONIST NATIONAL LEADER. ALTHOUGH HE SERVED AS PRIME MINISTER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS, HE IS STILL REGARDED AS MORE OF A 'SECURITY-MINDED LEADER' THAN A 'CIVILIAN LEADER'. NEVERTHELESS, AS PREMIER OF A FLEDGLING STATE, HE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING ISRAEL'S CIVIL INSTITUTIONS AND ESTABLISHING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. EVEN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ARMY AND SECURITY MATTERS DERIVED FROM A SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED CIVIL WELTANSCHAUNG CAPTURED IN HIS IDEA OF MAMLAKHTIYUT. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE CIVIL ROOTS OF HIS CONCEPT OF THE ARMY BY ANALYZING HIS INSISTENT DEMAND FOR THE ENACTMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFICIENT MILITARY CRIMINAL CODE (KNOWN IN ISRAEL AS THE MILITARY JUSTICE LAW').
424	IN BRITAIN, EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNALS (ET) ADJUDICATE ON WHISTLEBLOWING LEGISLATION. THEY DO SO WITH THE OVERRIDING AIM TO ADJUDICATE CASES FAIRLY AND JUSTLY, BY HEARING PARTIES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING. THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESEARCH QUESTIONING THIS RULE-OF-LAW ASSUMPTION VIS-A-VIS POWER IMBALANCES THAT RELATE TO WHISTLEBLOWING. USING MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WE ANALYSE ALL CASES AT ET IN ENGLAND AND WALES BETWEEN 2015 AND 2018, THAT INCLUDED A WHISTLEBLOWING CLAIM AND THAT WENT TO PRELIMINARY HEARING OR BEYOND. WE FIND THAT SEVERAL VARIABLES HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE RELATIVE REPRESENTATIONAL STRENGTH (RRS) AT ET, BUT NOT ON THE OUTCOME OF THE WHISTLEBLOWING CLAIM. HOWEVER, WHISTLEBLOWING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN COMBINATION OF DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS (41%) HAVE LOWER RRS AND LESS FAVOURABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE WHISTLEBLOWING CLAIM.
425	THE LOCAL SOURCING OF INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS IS ONE THE MAIN CHANNELS FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FM) SPILLOVERS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES WHETHER AND HOW PARTICIPATION AND POSITIONING IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) OF HOST COUNTRIES IS ASSOCIATED TO LOCAL SOURCING BY FOREIGN INVESTORS. MATCHING TWO FIRM LEVEL DATA SETS ON 19 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND VIETNAM TO COUNTRY-SECTOR LEVEL MEASURES OF GVC INVOLVEMENT, WE FIND THAT MORE INTENSE GVC PARTICIPATION AND UPSTREAM SPECIALIZATION ARE ASSOCIATED TO A HIGHER SHARE OF INPUTS SOURCED LOCALLY BY FOREIGN INVESTORS. THESE EFFECTS ARE LARGER IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER RULE OF LAW AND BETTER EDUCATION. (C) 2018 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. THIS IS AN OPEN ACCESS ARTICLE UNDER THE CC BY-NC-ND LICENSE.
426	TEASED OUT THROUGH A PLAYFUL TALE ABOUT A KING WHO FAILED IN EIGHT WAYS TO MAKE LAW, LON L. FULLER'S EIGHT PRINCIPLES OF THE 'INTERNAL MORALITY OF LAW' BECAME AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND RULE OF LAW THEORY ALIKE. MOREOVER, IT WAS FULLER'S CLAIM THAT HIS PRINCIPLES WERE NOT JUST INTERNAL TO THE ENTERPRISE OF LAW, BUT ALSO 'MORAL' IN CHARACTER, THAT PRECIPITATED A PARTICULAR KIND OF 'NATURAL LAW VERSUS LEGAL POSITIVISM' CONTEST THAT CONTINUES AMONG LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS TODAY. BUT AS A RECENT REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN FULLER'S THOUGHT INDICATES, HIS SCHOLARLY AGENDA AROUND THE IDEA OF 'THE INTERNAL MORALITY OF LAW' WAS WIDER STILL AND DESERVES REVISITING FOR THE RANGE OF AVENUES OF INQUIRY IT OPENS UP.
427	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF RENT-SEEKING IN RELATION BOTH TO ECONOMIC POLICIES AND POLITICAL PRACTICES IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ATTENTION TO CONTINUITIES AND SIMILARITIES IN THIS REGARD BETWEEN THE TWO DISTINCT PERIODS OF NATIONALIST RULE FROM 1948 TO 1994 AND FROM 1994 TO 2012. THE ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED ARE INDUSTRIAL POLICY, THE LABOUR MARKET, STATE ADMINISTRATION AND TENDERS AND SERVICE DELIVERY AND WELFARE. THE MORE SPECIFICALLY POLITICAL DIMENSIONS ADDRESSED INCLUDE THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE JUDICIARY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE DANGERS POSED BY EXCESSIVE RENT-SEEKING AND ESPECIALLY ITS NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR REDISTRIBUTION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN A HIGHLY UNEQUAL SOCIETY.
428	THE POLITICAL THEORY OF DANTE ALIGHIERI OPENS TO MAN A NEW PERSPECTIVE WHICH FOUNDS ACCEPTANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS IN MODERNITY. THE DEFENSE OF THE AUTONOMY OF POLITICAL POWER OUTSIDE THE CHURCH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A DEFINITION OF THEIR ACTIONS. THE TEMPORAL POWER HAS JUSTIFIED ITS EXISTENCE IN ORDER SOUGHT BY MAN, SO THAT REFLECTS HUMAN NATURE TO BE RATIONAL, FREE. ONLY THROUGH THE REALIZATION OF FREEDOM IN A SOCIETY WHERE JUSTICE AND ORDER REIGNS IS POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN HAPPINESS. IT IS THE RECOGNIZED VALUE TO THE MAN WHO GUIDES THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION. THUS, WE HAVE DANTE IN AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD THE RECOGNITION OF HUMAN DIGNITY WHOSE REALIZATION, THROUGH ALLOCATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, WILL BE IN THE RULE OF LAW.
429	THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE STRUCTURAL REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FUNDING FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION (ECE) AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC STILL CASTS DOUBTS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF ECE SYSTEM IN CHINA. A PARTICULAR CASE IN POINT IS THE SHENZHEN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT'S REFORM ON THEIR ECE FUNDING SYSTEM. BECAUSE THE REFORM EFFORTS ARE MORE ABOUT RESTRUCTURING THE SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM THAN REDISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING RESOURCES, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO PROPERLY DEFINE GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE FAIRNESS ISSUE. AFTER INITIAL TRIALS AND ERRORS, SUCH REFORMS NEED TO MOVE TOWARD A SYSTEMATIC AND RATIONAL DESIGN. THE CASE OF THE SHENZHEN ECE REFORM REVEALS THE INHERENT CONTRADICTION BETWEEN IMPETUOUS REFORM AND RULE OF LAW AND STRESSES THE NEED FOR REPLACING BOLD REFORM IMPULSE WITH SYSTEMATIZED INSTITUTIONAL PLANNING.
430	VARIOUS IMAGES HELP CAPTURE THE STATUS AND TRENDS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLICY EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT. WHILE "TREADING WATER" AND "SINKING" PARTLY DESCRIBE LEGAL CONDITIONS AT THE MILLENNIUM, THIS PAPER EXAMINES SEVEN CHALLENGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FIELD WHICH AT THE VERY LEAST PROMISE TO MAKE FOR A "HARD SWIM" IN COMING DECADES. THOSE CHALLENGES INCLUDE: COPING WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF NEGOTIATED INSTRUMENTS; OVERCOMING POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS; CLARIFYING THE JURISPRUDENTIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW; SORTING OUT THE RELATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS, SCIENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW; FLESHING OUT THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ADDRESSING PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES; AND VISIONING FUTURE PATHS OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE.

431	THE LAST DECADE HAS SEEN INCREASING DEMANDS FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IN DIGITAL GOVERNANCE. WHAT, HOWEVER, DOES ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIRE AND WHAT NORMATIVE GOODS DOES IT SERVE? THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING DIGITAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOCUSED ON FOUR NORMATIVE GOODS: OPENNESS, NON-ARBITRARINESS, EFFECTIVENESS AND PUBLICNESS. AS THE ARTICLE WILL EVIDENCE, CLAIMS FOR DIGITAL ACCOUNTABILITY OFTEN REFER TO DEFICITS RELATING TO ONE OR MORE OF THESE GOODS. WHILE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION HAS DESERVEDLY FOCUSED ON TYING POWERFUL DIGITAL ACTORS TO RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFERS AN IMPORTANT NORMATIVE YARDSTICK TO ALLOW CITIZENS TO CONTEST DIGITAL DECISIONS BEYOND STRICT LEGALITY. THE FRAMEWORK THEREFORE PROVIDES A BASIS FOR BOTH CONCEPTUALLY DISAGGREGATING AND NORMATIVELY FORWARDING ACCOUNTABILITY CLAIMS IN THE DIGITAL SPHERE.
432	A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE PROCEDURAL JUSTICE HYPOTHESIS THAT QUALITY OF TREATMENT MATTERS MORE THAN OUTCOMES FOR INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY. HOW FAIRNESS MATTERS ACROSS LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC SETTINGS REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION, HOWEVER. THIS ARTICLE USES A SURVEY OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS TO TEST THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF COURTS IN POLAND, A COUNTRY WHOSE JUDICIARY IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO INTENSE POLITICAL CONTESTATION. THE FINDINGS CONFIRM THE PRIMACY OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, WHILE ALSO ILLUSTRATING THE INFLUENCE OF INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCE FACTORS SUCH AS TIME AND COURT ORGANIZATION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT IN CONTEXTS OF POLITICAL TRANSITION WITH DISPUTED LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, CITIZENS' CONTACT WITH PROCEDURALLY FAIR, OPERATIONALLY EFFICIENT INSTITUTIONS CAN SUPPORT THE LEGITIMACY OF AUTHORITIES AND STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW.
433	CRIMINAL CASES AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN INDIA FREQUENTLY RESULT IN UNLAWFUL "COMPROMISES" WHERE LITIGANTS BREACH LEGAL PROCEDURE AND NEGOTIATE OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENTS. USING ETHNOGRAPHIC AND INTERVIEW DATA, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES HOW LEGAL CASES BECOME EXTRALEGAL SETTLEMENTS. I ARGUE THAT INDIA'S LEGAL ENVIRONMENT ENGENDERS AN "ASPIRATIONAL-STRATEGIC" LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AMONG SURVIVORS, WHO SIMULTANEOUSLY BELIEVE THEY DESERVE WHAT THE LAW PROMISES WHILE DISTRUSTING LEGAL PROCEDURE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. THEIR BIFURCATED VISION OF THE LAW LEADS THEM TO NEGOTIATE ILLICIT SETTLEMENTS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT EXPANSIONS IN LEGAL RIGHTS CAN HAVE CONTRADICTORY EFFECTS ON RULE OF LAW. DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE LEGAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, CITIZENS MAY RESPOND TO RIGHTS BY SIMULTANEOUSLY ADOPTING NEW NORMS WHILE IGNORING LEGAL RULES AND PROCEDURE.
434	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE ARE THREE NARRATIVES TO TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN AUGMENTING, DISRUPTING OR ENDING THE CURRENT LEGAL SERVICES ENVIRONMENT-EACH OF WHICH GIVES LIFE TO PARTICULAR LEGAL PROFESSIONAL ARCHETYPES IN HOW LAWYERS REACT TO LAWTECH. IN TRACING THESE INFLUENTIAL NARRATIVES AND ASSOCIATED ARCHETYPES, WE MAP THE EVOLVING ROLE OF LAWTECH, THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND LEGAL SERVICES DELIVERY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY PROFFERING A FURTHER NARRATIVE OF TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN LAW KNOWN AS 'ADAPTIVE PROFESSIONALISM', WHICH EMPHASISES THE COMPLEX, CONTEXTUAL NATURE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSIONAL FIELD. THROUGH THIS NORMATIVE RATHER THAN DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROFESSION MAY ACCESS THE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS WHILE HOLDING ON TO ESSENTIAL NOTIONS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
435	THE FALL OF THE FIRST REPUBLIC WAS A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT TO EMILIO CASTELAR, AND CONFIRMED HIS LIFELONG OPPOSITION TO MILITARY INTERVENTION IN THE POLITICAL LIFE OF THE NATION. HIS REPUTATION AS A STAUNCH DEFENDER OF LIBERTY, CIVIL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW WON HIM THE ADMIRATION OF INTELLECTUALS NOT ONLY IN SPAIN BUT ALL OVER EUROPE, AND HE WAS OFTEN ASKED TO LEND HIS VOICE TO THE EMERGING CIVIL-SOCIETY (I.E., NON-STATE) ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WERE CAMPAIGNING FOR PEACE IN EUROPE IN THE FACE OF THE INCREASING BELLIGERENCE OF THE GREAT POWERS. CASTELAR'S RESPONSE TO THESE APPEALS, WHILE UNDOUBTEDLY SHARING THE COMMITMENT TO PEACE, WAS INFLUENCED BY HIS PRIMARY CONCERN FOR THE INTERNAL WELL-BEING AND ORDER OF HIS OWN COUNTRY.
436	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THE PEDAGOGICAL STATE BY ANALYZING JUDICIAL SPACES, BEYOND THE COURTROOM, AS KEY SITES OF CITIZENSHIP FORMATION. I EXPLORE PEDAGOGICAL SESSIONS ORGANIZED BY A JUDICIAL STRUCTURE IN FRANCE, WHOSE GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY TO SEEMINGLY NON-INTEGRATED POPULATIONS IN THE BANLIEUE ALLOWS IT TO TEACH THEM THE LAWS, RULES, AND INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT CITIZENSHIP. I ARGUE THAT THE PEDAGOGICAL COURT SEEKS TO CONSTRUCT GOVERNABLE 'PASSIVE ORDINARY CITIZENS' WHOSE MAIN DUTY IS TO EMBODY AND PRACTICE THE BASIC RULES OF SOCIALIZATION - RESPECT FOR OTHERS AND THE RULE OF LAW - IN THEIR ORDINARY LIVES AS A STRATEGY OF CRIME PREVENTION. IN THAT SENSE, COURTS ARE ABLE TO REDEFINE NOT ONLY THE PROCEDURAL BUT THE SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF CITIZENSHIP AS WELL.
437	THIS STUDY ANALYSIS THE RELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TAXATION IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AT THE END OF EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS COVERING 60 COUNTRIES BY FOCUSING ON THE PERIOD OF 2006-2012, FINDINGS SHOWING A TWO-WAY CAUSALITY RELATION BETWEEN TAXATION AND DEMOCRACY WERE REACHED. ACCORDINGLY, AN INCREASE IN TAXATION LEVEL AFFECTS RULE OF LAW, ORGANIZATIONAL RIGHT, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND BELIEF POSITIVELY IN THE COUNTRIES ANALYZED. BRIEFLY, IT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY BY MAKING A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF CIVIL LIBERTIES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IMPROVEMENTS IN DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CITIZENS PAYING THEIR TAXES IN FULL AND ON TIME, THUS INCREASES TAXATION LEVEL, BY STRENGTHENING THE HARMONY BETWEEN CITIZENS AND STATE.
438	HUMAN RIGHTS REPRESENT A MINIMAL SET OF UNIVERSAL ETHICS THAT PERMIT THEM TO QUALIFY AS MORAL RIGHTS. THEY ARE CHARACTERIZED BY REASON AND ABSTRACTION, CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT ALL OF MANKIND IS ENDOWED WITH THEM. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ENCOMPASS VALUES OR AIMS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO BE ACCORDED PROTECTION BY THE RULE OF LAW-THESE REPRESENT THE CORE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITIES IN THE MODERN AGE. FOR THIS REASON, THESE RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. NONETHELESS, THE UNIVERSALITY OF RIGHTS IS UNDER THREAT BY CULTURAL RELATIVISM AND NATIONALISM, AS THESE UNDERMINE THE IDEA THAT THERE IS UNITY IN THE HUMAN CONDITION AND A HUMANISTIC UNIVERSALITY OF MAN'S MORAL PURPOSES.
439	IN THIS ARTICLE ARE IDENTIFIED POSSIBLE PEDAGOGICAL MEDIATIONS AS A RESULT OF A DISCUSSION BETWEEN LUTHER AND ERASMUS ABOUT THEIR CLAIMS OF "SERVANT-WILL" AND "FREE WILL". IT POINTS TO THE PEDAGOGICAL RELEVANCE OF THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN ITS ANTHROPOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT EDUCATIONAL POLICY OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL. THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE THESIS THAT THE "DUTY" OF EDUCATING IS EXCLUSIVE TO THE STATE, NO MORE CHURCH OR TO THE FAMILY. ITS CERTAINLY IS THE "RIGHT" OF CHURCHES AND FAMILIES TO RECEIVE THE STATE COMPULSORY BASIC EDUCATION. IT ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DEFINITION OF DUTY AND RIGHT TO EDUCATE AGAINST SOME ENTRENCHED BELIEFS OF THE MAGISTERIUM'S COMMON SENSE OF AND OF THE BRAZILIAN EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION.
440	THE CORE IDEA INSPIRING DEMOCRACY IS TO EMPOWER PEOPLE. TO MEASURE DEMOCRACY IN WAYS THAT CAPTURE ITS EMPOWERING NATURE, ONE MUST FOCUS ON POPULAR RIGHTS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RULE OF LAW AS A STATE QUALITY THAT MAKES THESE RIGHTS EFFECTIVE. BASED ON THIS PREMISE, AN INDEX OF "EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY," TESTED FOR 150 STATES, BEST REPRESENTS THE EMPOWERING NATURE OF DEMOCRACY BECAUSE IT MOST CLEARLY CAPTURES DEMOCRACY'S EMBEDDING IN EMPOWERING CONDITIONS IN THE WIDER SOCIETY. EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY IS SHOWN TO BE MOST FIRMLY EMBEDDED IN (A) EMPOWERING SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAKE PEOPLE CAPABLE OF PRACTICING DEMOCRACY AND (B) EMPOWERING SOCIOCULTURAL CONDITIONS THAT MAKE THEM WILLING TO DO SO. PEOPLE EMPOWERMENT APPEARS TO BE A UNITY OF EMPOWERING SOCIETAL CONDITIONS AND EMPOWERING REGIME CHARACTERISTICS.
441	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DEBATE ON 'CONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP' THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE FIRST ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS IN JENA IN 1924. IN THEIR KEYNOTE LECTURES, CARL SCHMITT AND ERWIN JACOBI ARGUED THAT ARTICLE 48 OF THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION AUTHORIZED THE PRESIDENT OF THE REICH TO DEROGATE FROM THE RULE-OF-LAW PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IF THIS WAS NECESSARY TO SAVE ITS 'POLITICAL SUBSTANCE'. ADVOCATING A 'DOCTRINE OF DEROGATION', THEY IMPLICITLY CRITICIZED ONE OF THE MAIN METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS OF LEGAL POSITIVISM, I.E., THAT LEGAL NORMS AND POLITICS, LAW AND POWER, HAD TO REMAIN STRICTLY SEPARATED. THEY THEREBY SET THE STAGE FOR THE EMERGING 'CONFLICT OF METHODS AND DIRECTIONS' THAT WAS TO HAUNT GERMAN JURISPRUDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.
442	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT ON THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL PROPOSALS FOR REFORM OF THE ROLE OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR AND THE APPOINTMENT OF THE JUDICIARY. IT ALSO LOOKS AT THE UNCERTAIN ACCEPTANCE OF A 'HUMAN RIGHTS' CULTURE BY THE DEPARTMENT CHARGED WITH LEAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE GOVERNMENT WENT FURTHER THAN WAS REQUIRED IN REFORMING THE ROLE OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR. AS A CONSEQUENCE, CONSIDERABLE - AND POSSIBLY UNDUE - WEIGHT NOW HANGS ON THE ENLARGED ROLE OF THE LORD CHIEF JUSTICE. MEANWHILE, THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL AFFAIRS AND ITS MINISTERS HAVE REJECTED THE 'RULE OF LAW' BRIEF OF THE LORD CHANCELLOR WITHOUT CLARITY AS TO WHERE SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES MIGHT NOW BE ADEQUATELY LOCATED WITHIN GOVERNMENT.
443	IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO GUARANTEE RULE OF LAW, CRIMINAL ORGANISATIONS HAVE EMERGED AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN CITIZENS AND THE STATE. IN SOME CASES, THESE ARMED NON-STATE ACTORS ADOPT REPRESSIVE STRATEGIES TO GOVERN THEIR TERRITORIES AND LOCAL POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY ASKS UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES LOCAL ACTORS MOBILISE AGAINST CRIMINAL GOVERNANCE. FOCUSING ON THE CASE OF MICHOACAN, MEXICO, I ARGUE THAT THE EMERGENCE OF VIGILANTE GROUPS, KNOWN AS AUTODEFENSAS, WAS PROMPTED BY THE BREACHING OF A SOCIAL CONTRACT - A SET OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL AGREEMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS - BETWEEN ORGANISED CRIME AND CIVIL SOCIETY. AS CRIMINAL GOVERNANCE SPREAD IN MICHOACAN, SO DID PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR AGAINST LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WHICH GAVE WAY TO AN ELITE-ORGANISED SOCIAL MOVEMENT STRUCTURED BY RURAL INEQUALITIES.
444	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO FILL A GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON THE EXTERNALISATION OF IMMIGRATION CONTROL BY FOCUSING NOT ON PRACTICES OF EXTRATERRITORIAL IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUT ON THE EXTERNALISATION OF IMMIGRATION CONTROL AT THE EU EXTERNAL BORDER. THE ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE FOUR PARALLEL AND INTER-RELATED TRENDS OF PREVENTIVE INJUSTICE ON THE BORDER: THE DENIAL OF LAW AND PUSHBACKS, AND THEIR HANDLING BY JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES AND EU INSTITUTIONS AND AGENCIES; THE EMERGING FRAMEWORK OF THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF MIGRATION; THE NORMALISATION OF BORDER PROCEDURES BASED ON THE FICTION OF 'NON-ENTRY'; AND DETENTION OF THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS AT THE BORDER, TO BACK UP NON-ENTRY POLICIES. THE ARTICLE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE RULE OF LAW DEFICIT SUCH EXTERNALISATION ENTAILS.
445	THE END OF THE DICTATORSHIP MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A TRANSFORMATION PERIOD IN ALL SOCIAL SEGMENTS, INCLUDING THE MILITARY. THERE WERE MANY CHANGES IN THE MILITARY LEGISLATION DURING THIS CONVOLUTED PERIOD, NAMED THE TRANSITION, AFTER THE PASSING OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION, WHICH INVOLVED THE MODIFICATION OF OLD INSTITUTIONS TO ADJUST TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. UNFORTUNATELY, REFORMS IN THE MILITARY FIELD WERE SLOW AND ARDUOUS. SPECIAL PRIVILEGES NAMED "FUEROS" WERE KEPT DURING MOST OF THE XX CENTURY, WHICH IN TURN HINDERED THE PROCESS OF MODERNIZATION AND ADAPTATION TO THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO DETERMINE THE KEY MOMENTS AND REFORMS DURING THE ADAPTATION OF THE MILITARY JURISDICTION TO THIS NEW REALITY.
446	IN CRIMINAL LEGAL DOGMATIC, THE GENDER PERSPECTIVE CRITERION HAS BEEN IMPLANTED. ALTHOUGH, IT AROSE FROM A LEGITIMATE SOCIAL CLAIM, SOME DOUBTS HAVE BEEN CREATED AS TO ITS EXPLANATION. IT HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALISM AS UNDERSTOOD BY LAW. THROUGHOUT THIS LEGAL ARTICLE LINES AND CRITERIA WILL BE PRESENTED AROUND SUCH A CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE. THUS, THE IMPLICATIONS PRESENTED IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF CRIME THEORY. IN THIS WAY, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO VERIFY IF THE JURISPRUDENTIAL INTERPRETATIONS IN CRIMINAL MATTERS ARE CORRECT, BECAUSE WE MAY NOT KNOW THAT IT IS IN THE LEGAL FIELD WHERE THE PRINCIPLE OF STRICT LEGALITY IS SEEN MORE INTENSELY WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO PRESERVE THE RULE OF LAW WHOSE APPLICATION IS ERGA OMMNES.
447	POPULIST POLITICIANS AND PARTIES ARE MEETING WITH SUCCESS. THEY ARE OPENLY OR LATENTLY CALLING INTO QUESTION PRINCIPLES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY SUCH AS RULE OF LAW, PLURALISM, AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES. IN TERMS OF CONTENT, ISSUES, AND IDEOLOGY, POPULISM HAS MANY FACETS. IT EXTENDS FROM THE EXTREME RIGHT VIA ANTI-MODERN AGRARIAN PARTIES AND SOCIAL POPULISTS TO LEFT-WING EGALITARIANISM. MOST ARE SOCIAL-SPIRITED, NATIONAL-MINDED, AND EURO-SCEPTIC. THE POPULISTS RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM THE PERIPHERY, FROM THE LOSERS IN URBAN CENTRES, AND INCREASINGLY FROM THE "IMPEDED MIDDLE-CLASS" WHOSE HOPES HAVE REMAINED UNFULFILLED. THE CONSENSUS FROM THE PERIOD OF THE ACCESSION TO THE EU TO ACCEPT SOCIAL HARDSHIPS NO LONGER FUNCTIONS. THE SUCCESS IS AN INDICATOR FOR A CONTINUING DEFICIENCY IN FUNCTIONS WITHIN STATE AND ADMINISTRATION.
448	THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF INTRA-ETHNIC CONFLICT INCLUDE HATRED AND FEAR AMONG NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS WHO HAVE BECOME ENEMIES. THE DEHUMANIZATION OF SPECIFIC GROUPS THROUGH CONCOMITANT STEREOTYPING DOES NOT STOP WHEN CONFLICTS END. THE INABILITY TO SEE FORMER ENEMIES AS REAL PEOPLE IMPEDES RECONCILIATION. WHILE MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RULE OF LAW, LITTLE THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO WHAT IS REQUIRED AT THE DAY TO DAY LEVEL IN ORDER TO RESTORE A SENSE OF INTERPERSONAL SECURITY. TO REVERSE THE DESTRUCTION OF SOCIAL AND FAMILIAL NETWORKS THAT NORMALLY SUSTAIN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, A PROCESS OF REHUMANIZATION MUST OCCUR. WE SUGGEST THAT THE PROMOTION OF EMPATHY IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF RECONCILIATION.
449	OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE BASIS ON WHICH NATION STATES EMPLOY FORCE HAS BEEN CHANGING FUNDAMENTALLY. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS CRIMINAL, TO BE DEALT WITH BY THE LEGAL AND JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND WHAT CREATES A 'PERCEPTION OF INSECURITY' - FORMERLY TO BE DEALT WITH BY SOCIAL POLICY - IS BEING ERODED AT BOTH THE MACRO ('WAR ON TERROR') AND MICRO ('PUBLIC ORDER') LEVELS. THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR THE UNBRIDLED USE OF STATE FORCE, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, AND THE CRIMINALISATION OF BEHAVIOURS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY ILLEGAL, IN THE SECOND. FEAR BECOMES A CONTROLLING MECHANISM FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SOCIAL ORDER AND ANY ELEMENT OF NON-CONFORMITY IS CONSTRUED AS A THREAT.
450	BASED ON A PUBLIC OFFICE DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION, THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE STUDIES OF DOCTORAL PLAGIARISM OF GERMAN MINISTER OF DEFENCE KARL-THEODOR ZU GUTTENBERG, HUNGARIAN PRESIDENT PAL SCHMITT, ROMANIAN PRIME MINISTER VICTOR PONTA, AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT, BY SHATTERING CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE IN AND RESPECT FOR POLITICAL CLASS, POLITICAL PARTIES, STATE INSTITUTIONS AND RULE OF LAW, ACADEMIC PLAGIARISM OF HIGH-RANKING POLITICIANS INTERTWINES WITH AND ENFORCES THE MOST SERIOUS DEMOCRATIC FAILURES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES: DEGENERATION OF POLITICAL CULTURE IN GERMANY, NATIONALIST AUTHORITARIAN TRENDS IN HUNGARY, A CULTURE OF CORRUPTION IN ROMANIA, AND OUTRIGHT DICTATORSHIP IN RUSSIA. AS SUCH, THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF PLAGIARISM GOES FAR BEYOND ACADEMIA. IT REPRESENTS A DIRECT, AGGRESSIVE, AND EFFECTIVE THREAT AGAINST DEMOCRACY ITSELF.
451	THIS ARTICLE IS PUBLISHED AT A TIME WHEN THE WORLD COMMEMORATES THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EVENTS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001, WHERE CIVILIAN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT WERE USED AS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. SOME ARE OF THE VIEW THAT AIR DEFENCE IDENTIFICATION ZONES (ADIZ) GAINED PROMINENCE AS A TOOL WITH WHICH A STATE COULD CONTROL AND BE PREPARED FOR AIRCRAFT APPROACHING THEIR TERRITORY. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF ADIZ AS A NECESSARY PRECAUTION AND ADDRESSES THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES AT INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE CONCEPT. IT ALSO BRINGS TO BEAR THE NUANCES BETWEEN WAR AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY CAN BE APPLIED AND STRETCHED TO ASCRIBE TO STATES JUSTIFICATION FOR THE IMPOSITION OF AN ADIZ.
452	IN THE DEMOCRATIC STATE, UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, THE EXISTENCE OF SPHERES FREE FROM DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL IS INCONCEIVABLE. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT CLAUSE OF ART. 97 EC, DISCRETIONALITY OR ADMINISTRATIVE OPPORTUNITY IS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL CONTROL, IN THAT IT IS THE GOVERNMENT WHICH TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT BEFORE PARLIAMENT AND PUBLIC OPINION. HOWEVER, THE APPEARANCE IN SPAIN MORE THAN TWO DECADES AGO OF SPHERES OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS MANAGEMENT CHARACTERISED BY THEIR NEUTRALITY AND PROVIDED WITH INDEPENDENT STATUS WITH RESPECT TO GOVERNMENTAL POWER HAS BROKEN DOWN THIS CLASSIC CIRCUIT OF RESPONSIBILITY. THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE SPECIFIC FEATURES SHOWN BY THE PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL MECHANISMS TO WHICH THE ACTIONS OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES ARE SUBJECT IN THE SPANISH LEGAL SYSTEM.
453	THE PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY IN LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF EXTRACTIVE OPERATIONS. MOST PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS IN THE REGION ARE POORLY TRAINED AND DO NOT UNDERGO ADEQUATE VETTING. THESE FACTORS COMBINED WITH SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN THE RULE OF LAW ACROSS THE REGION TOO OFTEN ENABLE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUTSIDE STATE CONTROL AND ENGAGE IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ADOPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PRIVATE SECURITY PROVIDERS (ICOC) BY LATIN AMERICAN PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES AND STATES, COUPLED WITH CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT WITH ICOC'S ASSOCIATION, MAY HELP REDUCE NEGATIVE HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACTS ARISING OUT OF PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES WITHIN THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY.
454	IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FAILED COUP ATTEMPT ON 15 JULY 2016, TURKEY STANDS AT A CRITICAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CROSSROADS. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THAT POLITICAL RISKS, INCLUDING INCREASING POLARIZATION AND THE ENDANGERMENT OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, ARE EXACERBATING WEAKNESSES AND UNDERMINING TURKEY'S LONG-TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE TURKISH ECONOMY IS SUFFERING FROM ITS DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN FUNDS, UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, AND A DECLINE IN ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY. IN ORDER TO SET TURKEY BACK ON ITS COURSE, A NEW POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PARADIGM IS REQUIRED. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE AN INSTITUTIONAL OVERHAUL WITH REGARDS TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW; REFORMING EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS TURKEY'S MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP; ELIMINATING WELFARE INEQUALITIES; AND IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA.
455	WE DOCUMENT THE WIDESPREAD EXISTENCE OF ANTISOCIAL PUNISHMENT, THAT IS, THE SANCTIONING OF PEOPLE WHO BEHAVE PROSOCIALLY. OUR EVIDENCE COMES FROM PUBLIC GOODS EXPERIMENTS THAT WE CONDUCTED IN 16 COMPARABLE PARTICIPANT POOLS AROUND THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THERE IS A HUGE CROSS- SOCIETAL VARIATION. SOME PARTICIPANT POOLS PUNISHED THE HIGH CONTRIBUTORS AS MUCH AS THEY PUNISHED THE LOW CONTRIBUTORS, WHEREAS IN OTHERS PEOPLE ONLY PUNISHED LOW CONTRIBUTORS. IN SOME PARTICIPANT POOLS, ANTISOCIAL PUNISHMENT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE COOPERATION- ENHANCING EFFECT OF PUNISHMENT. WE ALSO SHOW THAT WEAK NORMS OF CIVIC COOPERATION AND THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY ARE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF ANTISOCIAL PUNISHMENT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PUNISHMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL ONLY IF COMPLEMENTED BY STRONG SOCIAL NORMS OF COOPERATION.
456	THE ARTICLE I' THE INTRODUCTION TO THE CENTRAL THEME IN THI' I"UE OF ESPACIO ABIERTO, APPROACHING COERCION AND IT' RELATION 'HIP WITH BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 'PACE' FOR 'OCIAL CONTROL AND IT' DI'PLACEMENT WITHIN THE CONTINUUM FROM FORMALITY, REPRE'ENTED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND MORE RIGID PROTOCOL' TO INFORMALITY, REPRESENTED BY MORE FLEXIBLE RULES AND BEHAVIOR AMONG SOCIAL AGENTS. CONCEPTS AS FORCE, CONSTRAINMENT, INDUCEMENT, OPENESS, PUBLICITY, A' 'OME PROPO'AL' TO REDUCE 'OCIAL COERCION THROUGH INCREASED VISIBILITY, DESCALING OF CONFLICT AND EFFECTIVENESS CONTROLLING VIOLENCE, ARE DISCUSSED. FURTHER COMMENTS ARE MADE ON FOUR ARTICLE' IN THE I"UE RELATED TO VIOLENCE AGAIN 'T POLICE OFFICERS, CONTROL OF INMATES IN PRISON AND JAILS, AS WELL AS PRIVATE POLICE.
457	HOW DO GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS AFFECT STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE? AS STOCK MARKETS GROW BROADER AND DEEPER IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES, THE QUESTION BECOMES MORE CRITICAL. GOVERNMENT QUALITY DYNAMICS OF CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY OR NO VIOLENCE, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATION QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE INSTRUMENTED WITH INCOME LEVELS, RELIGIOUS DOMINATIONS, PRESS FREEDOM DEGREES, AND LEGAL ORIGINS TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE DYNAMICS OF CAPITALIZATION, VALUE TRADED, TURNOVER AND NUMBER OF LISTED COMPANIES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST COUNTRIES WITH BETTER DEVELOPED GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS WOULD FAVOR STOCK MARKETS WITH HIGHER MARKET CAPITALIZATION, BETTER TURNOVER RATIOS, HIGHER VALUE IN SHARES TRADED AND GREATER NUMBER OF LISTED COMPANIES.
458	THIS PUBLIC SOCIOLOGY CASE STUDY IS BASED ON AN EXPERIMENTAL SURVEY CONDUCTED WITH IRAQI JUDGES DURING THE EARLY MILITARY OCCUPATION OF IRAQ. THE US EFFORT TO FORCE DEMOCRACY BY REFORMING THE IRAQI JUDICIARY PRODUCED UNINTENDED AND INCONSISTENT RESULTS IN THE NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS OF IRAQI JUDGES. TORTURE WAS BOTH AN INSTRUMENT AND SYMBOL FOR FORCED DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ, AND THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER IRAQI JUDGES WOULD PUNISH THIS OFFENSE CONSISTENTLY. WE FOUND THAT THESE JUDGES RESPONDED IN A DISPARATE AND POLARIZED WAY TO THE INDETERMINACY OF TORTURE LAW AND THE HIERARCHICAL POWER OF COALITION GUARDS TORTURING AL QAEDA SUSPECTS. OUR ANALYSIS OF FORCED DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN IRAQ BROADLY ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PUBLIC SOCIOLOGY.
459	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES INSTITUTIONALIZED INSTABILITIES AND DECLINING DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY IN EAST ASIA. IT ARGUES THAT A WIDE RANGE OF REFORMS COULD IMPROVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN THE REGION. SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND THE NEED TO PROMOTE 'GOOD' DEMOCRACY. IT SUGGESTS THAT EAST ASIAN DEMOCRACIES SHOULD STRIVE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS THAT AVOID GRIDLOCKS AND PROMOTE EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE. ALTHOUGH ADOPTING THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM REPRESENTS THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY, REFORMING SECOND-TIER POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO IMPROVE PERFORMANCES OF PRESIDENTIAL REGIMES IN THESE COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, THESE DEMOCRACIES NEED TO DEVELOP THE INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESSES THAT ENCOURAGE GREATER RULE OF LAW, SYSTEM RESPONSIVENESS, MEANINGFUL CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, AND SOCIOECONOMIC EQUALITY. IF TAKEN, THESE REFORMS COULD PROVIDE EAST ASIAN DEMOCRACIES WITH ENHANCED STABILITY, EFFICACY AND LEGITIMACY.
460	ETHICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING ACCESS TO AND USE OF ELECTRONICALLY GENERATED DATA ARE (IF ASKED) COMMONLY RESOLVED BY DISTINGUISHING IN LOCKEAN FASHION BETWEEN RAW (UNWORKED) AND REFINED (WORKED) DATA. THE FORMER IS THOUGHT TO BELONG TO NO ONE, THE LATTER TO THE COLLECTOR AND THOSE TO WHOM THE COLLECTOR GRANTS ACCESS. COMPARATIVE POWER SEPARATES FREE RIDERS FROM RIGHTFUL OWNERS. THE RESULTING TWO-TIERED ETHICS OF ACCESS IS HERE CHALLENGED ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT INEQUITABLY ESTABLISHES A RULE OF LAW FOR THE STRONG WHILE LEAVING THE WEAK IN A HOBBESIAN STATE OF NATURE. EFFORTS AT LEGISLATIVE CONSTRAINTS ARE REVIEWED; BUT SUCH CONSTRAINTS ARE FOUND TO AFFORD INADEQUATE PROTECTIONS OF PRIVACY IF A DATA SUBJECT MAY NOT PROHIBIT OTHERS UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES FROM USING RECOGNIZABLY NAME-LINKED DATA.
461	ONE OF THE MOST DISCUSSED ITEMS AMONG HIGH COURTS OVER EUROPE DEALS WITH THE PRACTICE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION BY JUDGES. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DISCUSSION JUDGES IMPARTIALITY AND INDEPENDENCE PROTECTION IS AT THE STAKE BECAUSE BOTH ARE CONSIDERED AS THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. FROM 1982 STARTING WITH PIERSAK CASE, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS TOOK SIDES FOR THE PROBLEM; THE COURT ESTABLISHED ITS CANON HAVING IN MIND TWO ASPECTS OF THE IMPARTIALITY: THE SUBJECTIVE AND THE OBJECTIVE. THE PRACTICE OF THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION WILL AFFECT BOTH SIDES. THE PARTICIPATION OF JUDGES IN THE SOCIAL NETWORKS IS SPECIALLY DISCUSSED. BUT THE REMEDIES AGAINST THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LACK OF IMPARTIALITY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME: CHALLENGE AND ABSTENTION, THE TRADITIONAL REMEDIES.
462	WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RECIPIENT COUNTRIES THAT ATTRACT MORE CLIMATE FINANCE IN MITIGATING AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE? IN THIS STUDY, WE ADDRESS THIS QUESTION BY LOOKING AT RECIPIENTS IN 43 SUB-SAHARA AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2006-2017, AND IMPLEMENT SEVERAL PANEL REGRESSION TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENTS ESTIMATIONS TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY CONCERNS. WE ALSO PERFORMED SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSIONS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT SUB-SAHARA AFRICAN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER POPULATION GROWTH RATE, HIGHER POVERTY LEVELS, BETTER EASE OF DOING BUSINESS PROFILE, WEAKER GOVERNANCE POLICIES, WEAKER CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, STRONGER RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, DEEPENED SOCIAL INEQUALITY, AND BETTER ICT USAGE, HAVE ATTRACTED MORE CLIMATE FINANCE. POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY ARE DISCUSSED.
463	THE PAPER CLAIMS THAT, DESPITE THE RHETORIC OF ITS JUSTICES, THE SOCIAL PERMEABILITY OF THE BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT IS SELECTIVE: ACCESS TO THE COURT IS PROVIDED TO CERTAIN SOCIAL GROUPS, BUT NOT TO OTHERS. THE SOCIAL SELECTIVITY OF THE COURT OPERATES THROUGH FORMAL AND INFORMAL MECHANISMS BASED ON PROCEDURAL RULES THAT ARE SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES TWO OF SUCH MECHANISMS THAT ARE BARELY (OR NOT AT ALL) ADDRESSED BY EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP: THE RESTRICTIVE CASE LAW ON STANDING TO BRING ABSTRACT CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW CHALLENGES, AND THE PRACTICE OF INFORMAL PRIVATE HEARINGS BETWEEN ATTORNEYS, PARTIES, AND JUSTICES, KNOWN AS DESPACHOS. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF ACCESS TO THE COURT GOES AGAINST THE IDEAS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE, EQUALITY, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF.
464	TODAY SOCIETY PERCEIVES TRANSPARENCY AS A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE RIGHT TO TRANSPARENCY IS OUTLINED AS WELL AS AN ESSENTIAL RIGHT WITHIN THE RELATIONS OF CITIZENS WITH PUBLIC POWERS. FOR THAT REASON HAVE SURGED DIFFERENT LAWS OF AUTONOMOUS AND STATE CHARACTER WHOSE MISSION IS TO REGULATE THE TRANSPARENCY AND GOOD GOVERNMENT. THE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF GALICIA IS A PIONEER BOTH IN ITS CONCERN FOR THE SUBJECT AND IN ITS LEGAL REGULATION. THE TRANSPARENCY COMMISSION OF GALICIA IS PROOF OF THIS. THIS PAPER OFFERS A STUDY OF THE RIGHT OF TRANSPARENCY BY ANALYZING IT IN ITS CONCEPTUAL ASPECT AND IN ITS LEGAL MANIFESTATION, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON GALICIAN REGULATION. AT THE END, SOME REAL PROPOSALS FOR LEGISLATIVE IMPROVEMENT ARE OFFERED.
465	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE LEGAL VALIDITY OF CITIZENS' ACTIONS IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG. IT INTRODUCES THE CRITICAL APPROACH OF LEGAL REALISM IN ORDER TO RECONSIDER NORMATIVE LAW, SUCH AS POLICE ENFORCEMENT AND COURT INTERVENTIONS, IN RELATION TO POLITICAL STRUGGLE. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT THE LEGAL PRECEPTS OF RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE CAPABLE OF CONTINGENT AND CONTEXTUALLY APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATIONS BY DIFFERENT LEGAL ACTORS, INCLUDING CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATE IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. IN POLITICS, JUSTICE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LAW, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE LEGAL NORMATIVITY TO CONSIDER THE CITIZEN'S RIGHT, AND EVEN DUTY, TO EXPRESS DISSENT. FURTHERMORE, THIS RIGHT OR DUTY IS LEGALLY PERSUASIVE AND CONDUCIVE TO GUARDING DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
466	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE REFLECTION RIGHT TO EDUCATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ACCESS AND PERMANENCE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND ELEMENTS THAT ENSURE THE AIMS OF EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC SERVICE THAT FULFILLS A SOCIAL FUNCTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE REFLECTION OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND MEANING OF EDUCATION IN OUR COUNTRY; ENTER AND REMAIN IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS TWO ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTED BEYOND TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION IN RELATION TO THE PROVISION OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, ARE ALL FACTORS THAT PROMOTE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS A SET OF VALUES CULTURAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS THAT RELATE TO A CULTURE OF PEACE; FINALLY, TO ESTABLISH A CONCEPT OF CITIZENSHIP BASED ON THE PURPOSES OF EDUCATION.
467	POLITICAL LIFE WITHOUT COMMON IDEALS OR A COMPELLING VISION OF THE FUTURE LOSES ITS VITALITY AND DESCENDS INTO A PREDATORY STRUGGLE-A DANGER ALL TOO OFTEN EVIDENT IN POSTCOLONIAL AFRICA. YET IN THE ERA OF LIBERATION, A DISTINCTLY AFRICAN POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAL EMERGED, A HYBRID PHILOSOPHY OF NATIONHOOD THAT DREW ON THREE DISTINCT SOURCES: WESTERN IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, A SOCIALIST VISION OF MUTUAL AID AND RESPONSIBILITY, AND THE VITALITY OF AFRICAN COMMUNITARIAN TRADITIONS. IT WAS ALSO A DEEPLY RELIGIOUS VISION, IN WAYS SELDOM ACKNOWLEDGED EVEN BY ITS ADHERENTS. AFTER REVIEW OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN GHANA, KENYA, AND SOUTH AFRICA, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT A DISTINCTIVELY AFRICAN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER MAY STILL BE AVAILABLE AS A GUIDING VISION FOR AFRICAN NATIONS.
468	THE LOSS OF HOUSING FOR LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE IS OFTEN ONE OF THE DESTRUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ARMED CONFLICT. IN THE POST-CONFLICT PHASE, THOSE WHO TRY TO RECLAIM THEIR HOMES FACE MANY LEGAL CHALLENGES. AN EMERGING HUMAN RIGHT TO HOUSING RESTITUTION CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN ACHIEVING SUCCESSFUL HOUSING RESTITUTION. THE INCLUSION OF SUCH A RIGHT IN THE PEACE TREATY CONCLUDED AT THE END OF THE WAR IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SHOWS THAT LEGAL RECOGNITION OF PEOPLE'S HOUSING CLAIMS IS A CORE ASPECT OF POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION. IF IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY WHICH COMPLIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE RECOGNITION OF A RIGHT TO HOUSING RESTITUTION CAN BE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO STRUCTURAL PEACE IN FRAGILE STATES.
469	WHILE AMERICAN UNIONS HAVE A LOW AND DECLINING MARKET SHARE, THEY REMAIN VERY SIGNIFICANT, ESPECIALLY IN THE POLITICAL MARKETPLACE. THAT POLITICAL INFLUENCE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR UNIONS TO YIELD FAR MORE POWER IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAN THEIR MARKET SHARE IN THAT SECTOR (7.5 PERCENT) IMPLIES. ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL GOODWILL CAPITAL THAT UNIONS STILL ENJOY. F. A. HAYEK THOUGHT THAT IF PEOPLE, INCLUDING WORKERS, UNDERSTOOD THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF UNIONISM, UNIONS WOULD LOSE MOST OF THAT GOODWILL CAPITAL. HAYEK WROTE EXTENSIVELY ON TWO CATEGORIES OF MALIGN EFFECTS OF UNIONISM: THOSE INVOLVING BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THOSE INVOLVING THE ECONOMY AND THE FREE SOCIETY. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HIS VIEWS ON THE LATTER.
470	THIS PAPER COMPARES GROWTH CONDITIONS IN CHINA AND LATIN AMERICA TO ASSESS FEARS THAT CHINA WILL DISPLACE LATIN AMERICA IN THE COMING DECADES. CHINA'S STRENGTHS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE ECONOMY, MACROECONOMIC STABILITY, ABUNDANT LOW-COST LABOR, THE RAPID EXPANSION OF PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE ABILITY TO INNOVATE. CHINA'S WEAKNESSES, STEMMING FROM INSUFFICIENT SEPARATION BETWEEN MARKET AND STATE, INCLUDE POOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, A FRAGILE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND MISALLOCATION OF SAVINGS. BOTH REGIONS SHARE IMPORTANT WEAKNESSES: THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK, CORRUPTION ENDEMIC AND EDUCATION IS-LOW AND VERY POORLY DISTRIBUTED. ALTHOUGH FEARS ON MANUFACTURING AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT DIVERSION ARE OVERBLOWN, CHINA MAY BE A SOURCE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTABILITY WITH POTENTIALLY DAMAGING EFFECTS FOR LATIN AMERICA.
471	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER VIETNAM'S EXPERIENCE IN REFORMING ITS LAND LAW SUPPORTS OR CONTRADICTS THE VIEW THAT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, IN PARTICULAR THE FORMALIZATION OF INSTITUTIONS, IS A PREREQUISITE TO SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE PAPER EXPLORES THE REASONS FOR SLOW, INCREMENTAL AND PARTIAL LAND LAW REFORM AND ANALYSES THE COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ON LAND RIGHTS IN VIETNAM. USING THE COUNTRY AS A CASE STUDY, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PRECONDITIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH; RATHER INSTITUTIONS EVOLVE ALONGSIDE ECONOMIC CHANGE IN A NON-LINEAR, UNEVEN PROCESS SHAPED BY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS. THE POLICY IMPLICATION IS THAT CALLS FOR "GOOD GOVERNANCE" REFORM OR FOR "STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW" ARE USUALLY TOO BROAD BE HELPFUL OR EVEN REALISTIC.
472	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE PROCESSES OF ANTI-DEMOCRATIZATION AS A VIOLATION OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF CHANGES AND DIRECTIONS OF CRIMINAL POLICY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, ON THE EXAMPLE OF POLISH LEGISLATION. ACTIVITY OF THE LEGISLATOR IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL LAW WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY OF CRIMINAL LAW, WHICH SEARCHES FOR THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PUNITIVE REPRESSION IN A SOCIAL CONSENSUS, FAIR PROCEDURES FOR REACHING AN AGREEMENT, AND DEMOCRATIC MECHANISMS, WHILE MAINTAINING THE IDEALS OF SOCIAL AND AXIOLOGICAL PLURALISM. 'THESE ARE THE LIMITS OF THE RECOGNITION OF CRIMINAL LAW AS JUST. ANTI-DEMOCRATIZATION MEANS THAT LIMITS ARE EXCEEDED, WHICH CONSTITUTES A PRECEDENT AND A CHALLENGE FOR THE CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OF CRIMINAL LAW.
473	THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW STRINGENT DE FACTO FIRING REGULATIONS AFFECT FIRM SIZE THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD. A LARGE FIRM LEVEL DATASET IS USED ACROSS 63 COUNTRIES AND WITHIN COUNTRY VARIATION IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LABOR CODES IN COUNTRIES WITH VERY DIFFERENT DE JURE FIRING REGULATIONS IS EXPLORED. THE FINDINGS STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT FIRMS FACING A STRICTER ENFORCEMENT OF FIRING REGULATIONS ARE ON AVERAGE SMALLER. THIS FINDING IS INTERPRETED AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE FACT THAT MORE STRINGENT DE FACTO FIRING REGULATIONS TEND TO REDUCE AVERAGE EMPLOYMENT. ROBUST EVIDENCE IS FOUND THAT THIS EFFECT IS STRONGER FOR MORE LABOR INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING FIRMS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OPERATING IN LOW-TECHNOLOGY SECTORS. EVIDENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT THIS NEGATIVE CORRELATION DOES NOT HOLD IN COUNTRIES WITH A VERY WEAK RULE OF LAW.
474	WE FIND THAT THE DEAL STRUCTURE DECISION TO ENGAGE IN A FOREIGN ASSET PURCHASE INSTEAD OF ACQUIRING A FOREIGN TARGET'S EQUITY IS MORE LIKELY WHEN BIDDERS ARE SMALLER, THE BIDDER'S PROPORTION OF FOREIGN SALES-TO-TOTAL SALES IS HIGHER AND THE TARGET IS IN AN UNRELATED INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, BIDDERS TEND TO EXECUTE ASSET PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS RATHER THAN ACQUIRING A FOREIGN TARGET'S EQUITY WHEN THE TARGET'S CORRESPONDING COUNTRY HAS A RELATIVELY FAVORABLE RATING FOR RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, REGULATORY QUALITY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM. WE ALSO FIND THAT BIDDERS ENGAGING IN ASSET PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FAVORABLE VALUATION EFFECTS THAN THOSE THAT ACQUIRE THE EQUITY OF TARGET FIRMS. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER INC.

475	ANGOLA'S OIL-FUELLED RECONSTRUCTION SINCE THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR IN 2002 IS A WORLD AWAY FROM THE MAINSTREAM LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING APPROACH THAT WESTERN DONORS HAVE PROMOTED AND RUN SINCE THE END OF COLD WAR. THE ANGOLAN CASE IS A PIVOTAL EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE TERMED 'ILLIBERAL PEACEBUILDING', A PROCESS OF POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION MANAGED BY LOCAL ELITES IN DEFIANCE OF LIBERAL PEACE PRECEPTS ON CIVIL LIBERTIES, THE RULE OF LAW, THE EXPANSION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOMS AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION, WITH A VIEW TO CONSTRUCTING A HEGEMONIC ORDER AND AN ELITE STRANGLEHOLD OVER THE POLITICAL ECONOMY. MAKING SENSE OF THE ANGOLAN CASE IS A STARTING POINT FOR A BROADER COMPARATIVE LOOK AT OTHER CASES OF ILLIBERAL PEACEBUILDING SUCH AS RWANDA, LEBANON AND SRI LANKA.
476	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO ANALYZE CITIZEN EDUCATION AND ITS IMPACT ON SANITARY CONFINEMENT FROM THE EXPERIENCES LIVED IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 IN THE PERUVIAN TERRITORY. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS MADE OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES SELECTED FROM DIFFERENT IMPACT DATABASES, BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020 FROM WHICH 61 ARTICLES CHOSEN. IT CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS CONSENSUS THAT CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL AXIS FOR SUSTAINING DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HEALTH AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY, THEREFORE. IT REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES IN BASIC AND HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH WILL ALLOW, FROM THE EARLY YEARS, PEOPLE TO DEVELOP EMPATHY, STRENGTHEN IN HIGHER EDUCATION THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFT SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP AND QUALITY OF LIFE.
477	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS BY ANALYSING CIVIL ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION IN CHINA AFTER 2015. BASED ON THE FIELDWORK IN CHINA, THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE DYNAMICS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL MOBILIZATION AND IDENTIFIES THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE THAT MOBILIZES LEGAL ACTIONS. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT THREE MAIN FRAMES WILL IMPACT THE SUPPORT STRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT SOCIAL GROUPS NEED TO CONSTRUCT A CONSENSUS WITH STATE AUTHORITIES: (1) ASSISTING THE GOVERNMENT; (2) ADVOCATING POLICY CHANGE AND PROMOTING LEGAL REFORMS; AND (3) RESOLVING LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. THIS RESEARCH SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON LEGAL MOBILIZATION THEORY AND ARGUES THAT CHINA'S LEGAL REFORM WILL OPEN NEW PATHWAYS FOR ROBUST SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND SIGNIFY A MORE FORMAL RULE OF LAW.
478	COST SHIFTING POLICIES HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE WAY THAT LITIGATION IS CONDUCTED. TO MAINTAIN A RULE OF LAW IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT COURTS ARE AFFORDABLE. FOR COURT SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE AND EFFICIENT LITIGATION PROCESSES THEY MUST HAVE APPROPRIATE COST INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE THAT APPROACH IN THE LITIGANTS AND THEIR ADVISORS. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES A COST RULE AND SCALE THAT DOES SO BY PROVIDING FIXED RATE PROPORTIONATE COSTS FOR EACH OF THE STAGES OF THE LITIGATION TO ENCOURAGE EFFICIENT AND PROPORTIONATE USE OF COURT PROCESSES. A SYSTEM OF OFFERS TO ENCOURAGE PLAINTIFFS TO ACCEPT A DISCOUNT AND DEFENDANTS TO ACTUALLY PAY ANY JUDGMENT SUM ARE INCLUDED. IMPORTANTLY, LITIGANTS WHO EXAGGERATE THEIR CLAIMS, DEFENCES AND COUNTERCLAIMS ARE PENALISED UNDER THE COST FORMULA.
479	TUNISIA ADOPTED A PROGRESSIVE AND DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION, THE MOST PROMISING OF THE ARAB SPRING AND PERHAPS IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST. AS TUNISIANS WELL KNOW, HOWEVER, IMPLEMENTING THE CONSTITUTION WILL PRESENT DAUNTING CHALLENGES. THE NEW GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT, EXPECTED TO BE ELECTED IN THE AUTUMN, WILL HAVE TO QUICKLY ADDRESS PRESSING POLICY CHALLENGES: CHIEFLY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND DOMESTIC SECURITY. THE CONSTITUTION CREATES A POLITICAL SYSTEM WITH MANY VETO PLAYERS WITH A THIN LINE BETWEEN CONSENSUS AND DEADLOCK. THE WINNERS AND LOSERS OF THE NEXT ELECTIONS MUST COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE SUCCESS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND NOT A SPECIFIC ELECTORAL OUTCOME IN ORDER TO SET POSITIVE PRECEDENTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER.
480	THIS RESPONSE TO THE REPLY OF RUIZ MANERO MAKES REFERENCE ONLY TO OBJECTIONS FORMULATED TO THE THEORY OF LAW OF HANS KELSEN. KELSEN'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO VARIOUS DISCIPLINES WERE NOT APPROACHED BY THE ALICANTE AUTHOR. THEREFORE, ATTEMPTS ARE DONE TO REFUTE THE THESIS THAT THE PURE THEORY OF LAW ATTEMPTS TO "JUSTIFY" A HOBBESIAN CONCEPTION OF POSITIVE LAW. ARGUMENTS ARE PRESENTED AGAINST THE OBJECTION, THAT THE PURE THEORY IS UNABLE TO CONCEPTUALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A FINE AND A TAX, WHOSE ORIGIN IS IN HART'S ESSAY IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES HIS VISIT TO KELSEN. IT ALSO MAINTAINS THE VIEW THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AS A COERCIVE ORDER, IS MAINLY DIRECTED TO THE ORGANS OF STATE EMPOWERED TO IMPOSE THE SANCTIONS PROVIDED BY THE LAW AND ONLY IN A DERIVATIVE WAY TO PARTICULARS. IT ATTEMPTS TO PRESENT THE PROBLEMS THAT THE THEORY OF "TACIT ALTERNATIVE CLAUSE" TRIES TO SOLVE AND IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT DERIVES FROM THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONCEPTS OF "EXISTENCE", "VALIDITY", AND "REGULARITY" AND FINALLY QUESTIONS THE VIABILITY OF A SCIENCE OF POSITIVE LAW THAT UNIFIES THE DOGMATIC THEORY, PRACTICAL OR ETHICAL REASON AND SOCIOLOGY.
481	BORDER PUSHBACKS, INCLUDING AT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXTERNAL BORDERS AND BY COUNTRIES SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, MEXICO, TURKEY, AND THE UNITED STATES, ARE COMMON-AND IN FACT HAVE BECOME A NEW NORMAL. THESE BORDER POLICING OR OTHER OPERATIONS AIM TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM REACHING, ENTERING, OR REMAINING IN A TERRITORY. SCREENING FOR PROTECTION NEEDS IS SUMMARY OR NON-EXISTENT. PUSHBACKS VIOLATE THE INTERNATIONAL PROHIBITIONS OF COLLECTIVE EXPULSION AND REFOULEMENT, AND PUSHBACKS OF CHILDREN ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE BEST INTERESTS PRINCIPLE AND OTHER CHILDREN'S RIGHTS STANDARDS. EXCESSIVE FORCE, OTHER ILL-TREATMENT, FAMILY SEPARATION, AND OTHER RIGHTS VIOLATIONS MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY PUSHBACK OPERATIONS. DESPITE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES SUCH AS WEAK OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS, UNDUE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE, AND OFFICIAL AMBIVALENCE, DOMESTIC COURT RULINGS AND OTHER INITIATIVES SHOW SOME PROMISE IN SECURING COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND AFFORDING A MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY.
482	AVERAGE HAPPINESS DIFFERS MARKEDLY ACROSS NATIONS AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A SYSTEM IN THESE DIFFERENCES. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE ROLE OF QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, AND IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF TECHNICAL QUALITY AS OPPOSED TO DEMOCRATIC QUALITY. A COMPARISON OF 127 NATIONS IN 2006 SHOWS STRONG CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND AVERAGE HAPPINESS OF CITIZENS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TECHNICAL QUALITY AND HAPPINESS IS +0.75 AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC QUALITY AND HAPPINESS IS +0.60. TECHNICAL QUALITY CORRELATES WITH HAPPINESS IN RICH AND POOR NATIONS, WHILE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY ONLY CORRELATES WITH HAPPINESS IN RICH NATIONS. THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE APPEARS TO BE MORE IMPORTANT FOR HAPPINESS THAN THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENTS: THE RELATION BETWEEN QUALITY AND HAPPINESS IS INDEPENDENT OF SIZE, WHILE THE RELATION BETWEEN SIZE AND HAPPINESS FULLY DEPENDS ON QUALITY. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN TECHNICAL QUALITY AND HAPPINESS APPEARS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF CULTURE; IT EXISTS NOT ONLY IN WESTERN NATIONS, BUT ALSO IN EASTERN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA AND AFRICA. THIS INDICATES THAT TECHNICALLY GOOD GOVERNANCE IS A UNIVERSAL CONDITION FOR HAPPINESS, AND NOT JUST A WESTERN IDEOLOGY. DEMOCRATIC QUALITY ADDS SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF TECHNICAL QUALITY ONCE TECHNICAL QUALITY HAS REACHED SOME MINIMAL LEVEL.
483	THE LONGSTANDING CONVERSATION AROUND SOCIAL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT HAS COME IN WAVES. THE "FIRST WAVE" WAS FOCUSED ON THE JUSTICIABILITY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS, WHEREAS THE "SECOND WAVE" HAS DEBATED HOW COURTS SHOULD ENFORCE SUCH RIGHTS. SITUATING ITSELF WITHIN THE SECOND WAVE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT POLITICAL TRUST-THE TRUST WHICH CITIZENS HOLD IN GOVERNMENT ACTORS-OFFERS A PROMISING BASIS FOR A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENFORCING SOCIAL RIGHTS IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL DEMOCRACIES. THE AUTHOR OFFERS THREE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR WHY WE SHOULD USE POLITICAL TRUST AS THE BASIS FOR SUCH A FRAMEWORK: AN INSTRUMENTAL JUSTIFICATION ARISING OUT OF POLITICAL TRUST'S VALUE TO CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL DEMOCRACIES; A THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION STEMMING FROM THE FIDUCIARY NATURE OF THE CITIZEN-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP; AND A PRACTICAL JUSTIFICATION CONNECTED WITH THE "TWO WRONGS" OF SOCIAL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT. WITH THOSE THREE JUSTIFICATIONS OFFERED, THE AUTHOR THEN TAKES STEPS TO CONCEPTUALIZE POLITICAL TRUST IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF SOCIAL RIGHTS. THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION REVOLVES AROUND CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS HELD BY CITIZENS WITH RESPECT TO GOVERNMENT CONDUCT, SPECIFICALLY AN EXPECTATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL EXERCISE GOODWILL TOWARD ITS CITIZENS, FULFILL ITS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO CITIZENS, AND ACT COMPETENTLY. THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION PROVIDES US WITH SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT A POLITICAL TRUST-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR ENFORCING SOCIAL RIGHTS WOULD ENTAIL.
484	SOME HAVE PROPOSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT IMPROVE OUR MORAL BEHAVIOUR - MORAL ENHANCEMENT - IN ORDER TO ADDRESS GLOBAL RISKS SUCH AS PANDEMICS, GLOBAL WARMING AND NUCLEAR WAR. I WILL ARGUE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD BE WEAPONISED TO MANIPULATE THE MORAL DISPOSITIONS OF ENEMY COMBATANTS. DESPITE BEING MORALLY CONTROVERSIAL, WEAPONISED MORAL ENHANCEMENT WOULD BE NEITHER CLEARLY PROHIBITED NOR EASILY PROHIBITABLE BY INTERNATIONAL WAR LAW. UNLIKE PREVIOUS PSYCHOCHEMICAL WEAPONS, IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY PHYSICALLY HARMLESS. I ARGUE THAT WHEN COMBATANTS ARE LIABLE TO LETHAL AGGRESSION TO ACHIEVE AN AIM OF WAR, THEY ARE ALSO LIABLE TO WEAPONISED MORAL ENHANCEMENT TO ACHIEVE THAT SAME AIM. WEAPONISED MORAL ENHANCEMENT WILL LOOSEN JUST WAR REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH TRADITIONAL AND REVISIONIST NORMATIVE JUST WAR THEORIES. IT WILL PARTICULARLY AFFECT REVISIONIST THEORIES' JUS AD BELLUM REQUIREMENTS FOR HUMANITARIAN AND PREVENTIVE WARS. FOR INSTANCE, WEAPONISED MORAL ENHANCEMENT COULD BE MORE PROPORTIONAL AND EFFICACIOUS THAN LETHAL AGGRESSION TO EFFECT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN PREVENTIVE AND HUMANITARIAN WARS. I WILL CONCLUDE THAT, DESPITE EVADING INTERNATIONAL WAR LAWS AND LOOSENING NORMATIVE JUST WAR REQUIREMENTS, THE INTUITION THAT WEAPONISED MORAL ENHANCEMENT WOULD GRAVELY HARM COMBATANTS CAN BE DEFENDED BY ARGUING THAT IT WOULD SEVERELY DISTURB PERSONAL IDENTITY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY GROUND FUTURE PROHIBITIONS.
485	IN THE MODERN AGE, THE POLITICAL SECRET HAS ACQUIRED A BAD REPUTATION. WITH MODERN DEMOCRACY'S IDEAL OF TRANSPARENCY, POLITICAL SECRECY IS IDENTIFIED WITH POLITICAL CRIME OR CORRUPTION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS REPRESSION OF SECRECY IN MODERN DEMOCRACIES FALLS SHORT OF A SUBSTANTIAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE AND WORKINGS OF POLITICAL SECRECY. BY OUTLINING A GENEALOGY OF POLITICAL SECRECY, IT ELUCIDATES THE LOGIC AS WELL AS THE BLIND SPOTS OF A CURRENT CULTURE OF SECRECY. IT FOCUSES ON TWO FUNDAMENTAL LOGICS OF SECRECY, DEDUCED FROM THE LATIN TERMS 'ARCANUM' AND 'SECRETUM'. WHEREAS THE LOGIC OF ARCANUM REGARDS SECRECY AS A LEGITIMATE DIMENSION OF GOVERNMENT, A MODERN LOGIC OF SECRETUM IS MARKED BY AN INEXTRICABLE DIALECTICS BETWEEN THE WITHDRAWAL AND COMMUNICATION OF KNOWLEDGE, BETWEEN SECRECY AND PUBLICITY. HERE, THE SECRET IS NOT SO MUCH A PIECE OF WITHHELD KNOWLEDGE AS A 'SECRECY EFFECT' THAT BINDS THE REALM OF SECRECY TO THE PUBLIC SPHERE BY A DIALECTICS OF PERMANENT SUSPICION AND SCANDAL. INSTEAD OF FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF THIS 'SECRECY EFFECT' IT IS WORTH TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE TRADITION OF THOUGHT ON THE ARCANA IMPERII, FROM TACITUS TO EARLY MODERN DOCTRINES OF RAISON D'ETAT TO CARL SCHMITT. WHAT THIS TRADITION DEALS WITH IS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SECRECY AND ITS COMPLICATED RELATION TO THE LAW. THE ARCANA TRADITION ELABORATES THE CRUCIAL POINT OF SECRECY: ITS POTENTIAL, BUT ALSO ITS PROFOUND AMBIVALENCE. SECRECY OPENS UP A DISCRETIONARY SPACE OF ACTION EXEMPT FROM THE RULE OF LAW, AND, ACCORDING TO CARL SCHMITT, IGNORES THE LAW SO AS TO ALLOW IT TO BECOME EFFECTIVE. SECRECY SERVES TO PROTECT AND STABILIZE THE STATE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT OPENS A SPACE OF EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE OF LAW THAT BREEDS VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION AND OPPRESSION. INSTEAD OF SEEING SECRECY AS THE OPPOSITE OF A POLITICAL CULTURE OF TRANSPARENCY, IT IS MORE PRODUCTIVE TO REGARD SECRECY AS TRANSPARENCY'S COMPLEMENT - A COUNTERPART, HOWEVER, THAT IS MARKED BY THE PROFOUND PARADOX OF BEING BOTH A CONSOLIDATION OF AND A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.
486	IN CURRENT CONDITIONS, A CRISIS OF THE IDEAS OF DEMOCRACY, THE POLITICAL SUBJECT OF THE NATIONAL STATE AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURES IS OBSERVED. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A GROWING DEMAND FOR RIGHTS AND NEW FORMS OF RECOGNITION, NOT TO MENTION THE EMERGENCE OF MASS MOVEMENTS SEEKING GREATER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND GENERATING NEW COLLECTIVE SUBJECTIVITIES. THE RELEVANCE OF THE RESEARCH LIES IN THE FACT THAT RADICALLY CHALLENGING TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL CATEGORIES, KANT, FICHTE AND HEGEL PROVIDED A NEW AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS OF OUR TIME. THEY REPRESENT THE CONCEPT OF PRACTICAL RATIONALITY AND ITS NUMEROUS MANIFESTATIONS, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR A PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR MODERN WORLD. THE ACADEMIC PAPER ANALYZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL DOCTRINES OF GERMAN CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY'S REPRESENTATIVES. IN PARTICULAR, KANT'S CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MORAL RIGHT OR THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE FORMED THE BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. THE IMPERATIVE OF MUTUAL RESTRICTION OF CITIZENS' FREEDOM AS A CONDITION FOR ENSURING THE FREE EXISTENCE OF PEOPLE WAS PROPOSED BY KANT AND FICHTE. HEGEL'S IDEAS ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ESSENCE AND PHENOMENON IN LAW BECAME FUNDAMENTAL TO JUSTIFY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A PHENOMENON THAT DISTINGUISHES RIGHT FROM THE POSITIVE RIGHT. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ADDRESS THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL VIEWS AND THEORIES (IDEAS AND PRINCIPLES) OF GERMAN CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHERS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE BASIC (FUNDAMENTAL) LAWS OF DEVELOPING THEIR CONTENT. THE ANALYSIS OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL DOCTRINES HAS SHOWN THAT THE AUTHORS' VIEWS ON LEGAL PROVISIONS ARE REPRESENTED AS AN EXPRESSION OF RATIONAL SELECTION, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WERE RATIONALLY DEMANDED AND BUILT BY DIVIDING AND LIMITING MODELS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE ONLY EFFECTIVE MECHANISM AND CREATION OF A CULTURE OF ALL MANKIND CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING THE SAFE EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF A PERSON IS THE LAW AND ITS UNDERSTANDING, BASED ON THE IMPERATIVE OF PRESERVING HUMAN NATURE AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF STATE REGULATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS.
487	A MAN WHO IS HABITUALLY PUNISHED FOR DOING WHAT HE WAS ORDERED TO DO CAN HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO ORDERS GIVEN HIM IN THE FUTURE. IF OUR TREATMENT OF HIM IS PART OF AN ATTEMPT TO BUILD UP A SYSTEM OF RULES FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF HIS CONDUCT, THEN WE SHALL FAIL IN THAT ATTEMPT. ON THE OTHER HAND IF OUR OBJECT IS TO CAUSE HIM TO HAVE A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, WE MAY SUCCEED. - LON L. FULLER(1) HELLO, DAVE. I THINK WE MAY BE ON TO AN EXPLANATION OF THE TROUBLE WITH THE HAL 9000 COMPUTER .... WE BELIEVE HIS TRUTH PROGRAMMING AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO LIE, GRADUALLY RESULTED IN AN INCOMPATIBLE CONFLICT, AND FACED WITH THIS DILEMMA, HE DEVELOPED, FOR WANT OF A BETTER DESCRIPTION, NEUROTIC SYMPTOMS. - STANLEY KUBRICK & ARTHUR C. CLARKE(2) THIS ARTICLE COINS THE TERM "ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS OF LAW" TO DESCRIBE SITUATIONS OF OVERLAPPING LAWS FROM DFFERENT STATES THAT CONTAIN SIMULTANEOUS CONTRADICTORY COMMANDS. IT ARGUES THAT ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS ARE A UNIQUE LEGAL PHENOMENON IN NEED OF A UNIQUE DOCTRINE. THE ARTICLE EXTENSIVELY EXPLORES WHAT ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS ARE; HOW THEY QUALITATIVELY OFFER FROM OTHER DOCTRINES LIKE TRUE CONFLICTS OF LAW, ACT OF STATE, AND COMITY; AND CLASSIFIES ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS' MYRIAD DOCTRINAL MANIFESTATIONS THROUGH A TAXONOMY THAT CATEGORIZES ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS AS PROCEDURAL, SUBSTANTIVE, MIXED, HORIZONTAL,- AND VERTICAL. THE ARTICLE THEN PROPOSES SOLUTIONS TO ABSOLUTE CONFLICTS THAT CENTER ON THE RULE OF LAW AND FAIRNESS TO PARTIES SOLUTIONS THAT ARE IN METHODOLOGICAL TENSION WITH PREVAILING TESTS THAT PREFERENCE LARGELY, IF NOT EXCLUSIVELY, STATE INTERESTS. THE FAIRNESS TEST THE ARTICLE ADVANCES PULLS FROM CONSIDERATIONS COURTS HAVE BEEN QUIETLY DEVELOPING OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES AND REORIENTS ABSOLUTE CONFLICT ANALYSIS AROUND THESE CONSIDERATIONS. IT CONCLUDES BY SHOWING THAT A FAIRNESS TEST GENERATES BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PARTIES, STATES, AND THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM GENERALLY, NOT ONLY BY BETTER CONFORMING TO THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO BY BETTER FACILITATING TRANSNATIONAL ACTIVITY BENEFICENT TO OVERALL WELFARE.
488	SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ENGAGED IN A HOST OF CONTROVERSIAL COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIONS THAT THREATEN CIVIL LIBERTIES AND EVEN THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF THOSE TARGETED: ENEMY COMBATANT DESIGNATIONS, EXTREME INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES, EXTRAORDINARY RENDITIONS, SECRET OVERSEAS PRISONS, AND WARRANTLESS DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE. TO JUSTIFY OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL POLICIES, PRESIDENT BUSH AND HIS LAWYERS HAVE ESPOUSED AN EXTREME VIEW OF EXPANSIVE PRESIDENTIAL POWER DURING TIMES OF WAR AND NATIONAL EMERGENCY. DEBATE HAS RAGED ABOUT THE DETAILS OF DESIRABLE EXTERNAL CHECKS ON PRESIDENTIAL EXCESSES, WITH EMPHASIS APPROPRIATELY ON THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE COURTS. YET AN ESSENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCE OF CONSTRAINT IS OFTEN UNDERESTIMATED: LEGAL ADVISORS WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ON A DAILY BASIS, THE PRESIDENT MUST ENGAGE IN DECISIONMAKING THAT IMPLICATES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY. WHETHER TO SEEK CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION BEFORE ENGAGING IN WAR, WHAT LIMITS TO SET (AND RESPECT) ON INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES, WHEN TO PUBLICLY RELEASE INFORMATION REGARDING SECURITY EFFORTS-ALL ARE ISSUES OVER WHICH THE PRESIDENT EXERCISES ENORMOUS PRACTICAL CONTROL, AND ALL CAN PROFOUNDLY AFFECT INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND THE COURSE OF HISTORY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES EXECUTIVE BRANCH LEGAL INTERPRETATION: HOW CAN INTERNAL INTERPRETIVE PROCESSES AND STANDARDS FOSTER OR UNDERMINE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW? WHAT MAY BE GLEANED FROM RECENT FAILURES? HOW MIGHT THE COURTS AND CONGRESS NOT ONLY HOLD PRESIDENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PARTICULAR FAILURES TO UPHOLD THE LAW, BUT ALSO ENCOURAGE PROCESSES THAT GENERALLY ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH LEGAL ADVICE AND DECISIONMAKING? THIS ARTICLE TAKES AS ITS PRINCIPAL EXAMPLE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S INTERROGATION POLICIES. IT CONSIDERS PAST FAILURES AND, LOOKING FORWARD, WHAT STANDARDS SHOULD GOVERN THE FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE LAWS. IT BUILDS UPON A STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, IN WHICH NINETEEN FORMER OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL LAWYERS SET FORTH THE BEST OF LONGSTANDING PRACTICES IN AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE PRESIDENTIAL FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW.
489	THIS COMMENT ARGUES THAT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS PROVIDES AN INADEQUATE ACCOUNT OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR BECAUSE ECONOMIC MODELS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH A JURISPRUDENCE THAT RECOGNIZES BASIC RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. WHEREAS STANDARD ECONOMIC THEORY IS COMMITTED TO THINKING OF A JUDGE AS EXCLUSIVELY SELF-INTERESTED, TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS CONCEPTION EXIST. FIRST, AS APPLICATION OF AMARTYA SEN'S CRITIQUE OF THE BEHAVIORAL FOUNDATIONS OF ECONOMIC THEORY TO JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR REVEALS, THE DECISION OF A JUDGE WHO MEETS HER JUDICIAL OBLIGATIONS MAY FAIL TO MAXIMIZE HER SELF-INTEREST. SECOND, EVEN IF THE SELF-INTEREST-MAXIMIZING DECISION COINCIDES WITH THE BEHAVIOR THAT HER JUDICIAL OBLIGATIONS REQUIRE, ECONOMIC MODELS STILL FAIL TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE EXPLANATION OF JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING. THIS INABILITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ECONOMIC THEORY'S FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR-WHAT H.L.A. HART COMPELLINGLY DESCRIBES AS RELATING TO A RULE FROM THE INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW. IN OVERCOMING LAW, RICHARD POSNER ANTICIPATES THIS COMMENT'S CHALLENGE TO THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR, BUT SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS EXIST WITH HIS ATTEMPT TO MEET IT. BECAUSE POSNER ASSUMES AWAY,NY THE PROBLEM OF OBLIGATION AND REDUCES JUDICIAL MOTIVATION TO SELF-INTEREST, HIS METHOD NEGLECTS HART'S CONCERN WITH THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF OBLIGATORY SOCIAL RULES. IT IS THUS INCOMPATIBLE AT THE THEORETICAL LEVEL WITH THE LIBERAL IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. ADDITIONALLY, POSNER'S APPROACH IS ANTI-EMPIRICAL BY METHODOLOGICAL NECESSITY. THUS, HIS ASSERTIONS NOTWITHSTANDING, HIS THEORY OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR IS NO MORE EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED THAN THE LIBERAL JURISPRUDENCE WHOSE CONCEPTION OF THE JUDGE HE DERIDES. NEVERTHELESS, THIS REALITY DOES NOT ABSOLVE ADHERENTS OF LIBERAL LEGAL PHILOSOPHY FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPIRICALLY TESTING THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDINGS OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR RATHER, RESEARCHERS NEED TO TEST EMPIRICALLY BOTH HART'S AND POSNER'S ACCOUNTS OF WHY JUDGES FOLLOW INSTITUTIONAL RULES. IN PARTICULAR, IN ADDITION TO OBSERVING JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR; INVESTIGATORS NEED TO PERSUADE JUDGES TO INTROSPECT ABOUT AND COMMUNICATE THEIR EXPERIENCES OF THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER ON THE BENCH.
490	WE PRESENT A FACTORIAL SURVEY EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED WITH IRAQI JUDGES DURING THE EARLY MILITARY OCCUPATION OF IRAQ. BECAUSE U.S. SOLDIERS ARE IMMUNE FROM PROSECUTION IN IRAQI COURTS, THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE JUDGES TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS REGARDING HIGHLY PUBLICIZED TORTURE CASES. AS LEGALLY INFORMED REPRESENTATIVES OF AN OCCUPIED NATION, HOWEVER, IRAQI JUDGES ARGUABLY HAVE A STRONG CLAIM TO A NORMATIVE VOICE ON THIS SENSITIVE SUBJECT. WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE VOICE TO THESE JUDGES IN THIS STUDY BY USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL METHOD. THIS METHOD DIMINISHES SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS IN JUDGES' RESPONSES AND ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER A BROAD RANGE AND COMBINATION OF FACTORS INFLUENCING THEIR NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS. WE EXAMINE WHY AND HOW THE U.S. EFFORT TO INTRODUCE DEMOCRACY WITH AN INDETERMINATE RULE OF LAW PRODUCED UNINTENDED AND INCONSISTENT RESULTS IN THE NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS OF IRAQI JUDGES. A CRITICAL LEGAL PERSPECTIVE ANTICIPATES THE INFLUENCES OF INDETERMINACY, POWER, AND FEAR IN OUR RESEARCH. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE ANTICIPATED LENIENT TREATMENT FOR GUARDS CONVICTED OF TORTURE, ESPECIALLY IN TROUBLE CASES OF COALITION SOLDIERS TORTURING AL QAEDA PRISONERS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS-WHICH INCLUDE CROSS-LEVEL, JUDGE-CASE INTERACTION EFFECTS-WERE MORE VARIED THAN THEORETICALLY EXPECTED. THE IRAQI JUDGES RESPONDED IN DISPARATE AND POLARIZED WAYS. SOME JUDGES IMPOSED MORE SEVERE SENTENCES ON COALITION GUARDS CONVICTED OF TORTURING AL QAEDA SUSPECTS, WHILE OTHERS IMPOSED MORE LENIENT SENTENCES ON THE SAME COMBINATION OF GUARDS AND SUSPECTS. THE CROSS-LEVEL INTERACTIONS INDICATE THAT THE JUDGES WHO SEVERELY SENTENCED COALITION GUARDS LIKELY FEARED THE CONTRIBUTION OF TORTURE TACTICS TO INCREASING VIOLENCE IN IRAQ. THE JUDGES WHO WERE LESS FEARFUL OF VIOLENCE WERE MORE LENIENT AND ACCOMMODATING OF TORTURE BY COALITION FORCES. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE LESS FEARFUL JUDGES WERE FREED BY AN INDETERMINATE LAW TO ADVANCE COALITION GOALS THROUGH LENIENT PUNISHMENT OF TORTURE. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN IRAQ IS A NEGATIVE CASE IN THE INTERNATIONAL DIFFUSION OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THE NEED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A NUANCED CRITICAL LEGAL PERSPECTIVE.
491	THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IS REGARDED AS THE MAIN DEMAND FOR DEMOCRATIC STATES; THE REGULAR COURTS AND HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE IN JORDAN HAVE DELIVERED MANY SEVERAL DECISIONS THAT INSIST ON THE ISSUE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LAW AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY COMPRISES A NUMBER OF SECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION, GENERAL NOTION ON DEMOCRACY AND JUDICIAL CONTROLLING IN JORDAN, IS STATEMENT OF THE STUDY PROBLEMS, PURPOSES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY AND THE METHODOLOGY APPLIED BY THE RESEARCHERS. DEMOCRACY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF JORDAN AND THE MAIN FEATURES OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS CONSTITUTION ARE UNDERTAKEN IN THE SECOND SECTION. THE THIRD SECTION AIMS TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE NATIONAL STANDERS PERTAINING TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND RULE OF LAW IN JORDAN. THE FOURTH SECTION EVALUATES THE JUDICIAL REVIEW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF JORDAN AND THE NATIONAL CHARTER, WHILE SECTION FIVE EXAMINES RESPECTIVELY THE ROLE OF JUDICIARY IN DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS OF JORDANIAN CITIZENS AND THE NORMS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND RULE OF LAW IN JORDAN. THE SIXTH SECTION HIGHLIGHTS THE ISSUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE JUDICIAL REFORM IN JORDAN. THE SUBJECT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, CONTROL OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY LAWS AND TYPES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW AS WELL JUDICIARY'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS JUDICIAL REVIEW IN JORDAN IS DISCUSSED DEEPLY IN THE SEVENTH SECTION. FINALLY, SECTION EIGHT, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE ISSUE OF DEMOCRACY AND JUDICIAL CONTROLLING IN JORDAN. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE VIOLABLE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN JORDAN SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION AS IT IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL CHARTER, 1992 WHICH REQUIRES A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THE COURT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT AND SEPARATED FROM ANY TYPE OF CONTROLLING OF OTHER COURTS, EITHER REGULAR OR ADMINISTRATIVE. IT ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT THE COURT SHOULD BE INTERLAY CONSTITUTED FROM EXPERIENCED, IMPARTIAL AND TALENTED JUDGES WITH LONG TERM OF SERVICE AND SHOULD EXERCISE EQUALLY PROGRESSIVE ROLE IN INTERVENING POWER POLITICS AND THAT MORE PRECAUTIONS MAY BE TAKEN FOR THE COURT.
492	INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY EXAMINED POTENTIAL LEGAL PRECEDENT SET BY HOLDINGS IN ADMINISTRATIVE DUE PROCESS HEARINGS WHERE INSTRUCTION IN THE EXPANDED CORE CURRICULUM (ECC) FOR SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN WAS DECIDED. METHODS: THIS STUDY USED AN ANALOGICAL REASONING APPROACH. THIS LEGAL RESEARCH METHOD INCLUDES EXAMINING THE RULE OF LAW, PRESENTING CASES FOR COMPARISON, AND APPLYING THE FACT PATTERN TO PREDICT OUTCOMES OF CURRENT OR FUTURE CASES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INCLUSION OF THE ECC IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM (IEP) VARIES FROM STATE TO STATE. ONLY TWO STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION REQUIRING INSTRUCTION IN THE ECC. THESE STATUTES HAVE BEEN REFERENCED IN CASE HOLDINGS. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS FROM FOUR DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE HELD THAT THE ECC MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE IEP TO SOME EXTENT. DISCUSSION: THE ECC IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS AND MUST BE INCORPORATED IN SOME FORM WITHIN THEIR IEPS. DEPENDING UPON THE JURISDICTION, THE ECC MAY HAVE TO BE EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE IEP, WHILE IN OTHER LOCALES IT MAY HAVE TO BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE IEP. IN SOME STATES, SPECIFIC STATUTES GOVERNING INSTRUCTION IN THE ECC FORM THE RULE OF LAW. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS: SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS OF STUDENTS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD BE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE LEGISLATION GOVERNING THE ECC IN THEIR STATE AND THE LEGAL PRECEDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THEIR STATE. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS OF STUDENTS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER HOW THE PRINCIPLES OF A LEGAL PRECEDENT CAN BE APPLIED TO SITUATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND LIKELIHOOD OF PREVAILING IN ANY LEGAL DISPUTE. FINALLY, PARENTS AND STUDENTS WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE LEGAL PRECEDENT CREATED FOR THE ECC IN THEIR STATE AND USE THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS TO INFORM CHANGE IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AS THE FAMILIES DID IN THESE EXEMPLAR CASES.
493	OVER A DECADE HAS PASSED SINCE LANDMARK DELAWARE CORPORATE LAW DECISIONS ON OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY, AND ONLY A SMALL HANDFUL OF CASES HAVE SURVIVED A MOTION TO DISMISS. SCHOLARS HAVE PUZZLED OVER WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY LODGED WITHIN THE DUTY OF GOOD FAITH, BUT ALMOST NEVER BROUGHT TO FRUITION IN TERMS OF TRIAL LIABILITY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE PUBLIC-REGARDING PURPOSE OF THE OBEDIENCE AND OVERSIGHT DUTIES IN CORPORATE LAW AND PROVIDES A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF HOW THEY ARE APPLIED IN PRACTICE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE FIDELITY TO EXTERNAL LAW REQUIRED BY THE DUTY OF GOOD FAITH LARGELY SERVES A LEGITIMIZING ROLE FOR CORPORATE LAW. EXPRESSING OBLIGATIONS OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT WITHIN CORPORATE LAW ACKNOWLEDGES SOCIETAL INTERESTS IN THE RULE OF LAW AND PRESERVES THE ABILITY OF COURTS TO FLEXIBLY RESPOND TO PARTICULARLY SALIENT AND EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF PUBLIC TRUST, SHOULD THEY ARISE, WITHOUT UPENDING CASE LAW DEVELOPED OVER DECADES. FURTHER, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE BODY OF DELAWARE LAW CONCERNING THE OVERSIGHT AND OBEDIENCE ASPECTS OF THE DUTY OF GOOD FAITH AND ARGUES THAT THEY HAVE BECOME FUNCTIONALLY LINKED. IN PRACTICE TO DATE, DELAWARE COURTS HAVE PRIORITIZED GIVING DIRECTORS BROAD LATITUDE TO TAKE BUSINESS RISK BY DRAWING A LINE AT LEGAL RISK, DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY THAT BOTH TYPES OF ACTIVITY COULD CREATE SOCIAL VALUE OR HARM DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES. UNDER CURRENT DELAWARE CASE LAW, COURTS HAVE ALLOWED CAREMARK CLAIMS TO PROCEED WHERE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO INFER THAT THE BOARD UTTERLY FAILED TO IMPLEMENT A COMPLIANCE MONITORING SYSTEM OR THAT THE DIRECTORS ENGAGED IN DISOBEDIENCE BY CONSCIOUSLY FLOUTING, VIOLATING, OR IGNORING THE LAW. BRINGING TOGETHER THESE THREADS OF DISCUSSION, THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT CORPORATE LAW'S PUBLIC-REGARDING COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW SUPPORTS ACCOUNTABILITY IN THESE INSTANCES OF DISOBEDIENCE AS WELL AS MORE BROADLY WHEN FIDUCIARIES ACT WITH WILLFUL IGNORANCE OR AN AWARENESS THAT THEIR EFFORTS AT COMPLIANCE ARE INSUFFICIENT.
494	JUSTICE SCALIA, IN THE END, WAS NO INTERPRETIVE FORMALIST. HE WOULD NOT BE PLEASED TO HEAR THIS CLAIM, BUT THE FACT IS THAT FORMALISM HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, AND IN FACT, THE TEXTUALISM THAT JUSTICE SCALIA DESERVES SO MUCH CREDIT FOR CREATING NEVER REALLY EMBRACED FORMALISM AT ALL. TEXTUALISM LACKS ALL THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR FORMALISM. IT DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINED SET OF PREDICTABLE RULES ORDERED TO ENSURE OBJECTIVE APPLICATION. INSTEAD, WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INTERPRETIVE PRESUMPTIONS THE PRESUMPTIONS FAVORED BY TEXTUALISTS WITH NO DEFINED METHOD OF CHOOSING AMONG THEM. THESE DOCTRINES OF THE FIELD ARE NOT TREATED AS PRECEDENT OR EVEN AS LAW THAT A HIGHER COURT OR CONGRESS IS ENTITLED TO MAKE. INSTEAD, THEY OCCUPY THE UNIQUE STATUS OF BEING VIEWED AS INHERENTLY PERSONAL TO THE INDIVIDUAL JUDGE, A STATUS NOT SHARED BY ANY OTHER DOCTRINES APPLIED BY ARTICLE III COURTS. THE DOCTRINES DO NOT HAVE A THEORIZED JURISPRUDENCE THAT LEGITIMATES THEIR SOURCE, TIES THEM TO A SOVEREIGN LAWMAKING POWER, OR EVEN INDICATES WHERE THE RULES COME FROM. JUSTICE SCALIA HIMSELF WAS NEVER WILLING TO ADMIT THAT MANY CANONS INCLUDING ONES HE HIMSELF INVENTED ARE JUDICIAL CREATIONS, AND HENCE, FEDERAL COMMON LAW; TO THE CONTRARY, HE ARGUED THAT TREATING THEM AS COMMON LAW MIGHT BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. JUSTICE SCALIA'S INCOMPARABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO STATUTORY INTERPRETATION DESERVE GREAT RECOGNITION. BUT EVEN THOUGH HIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO CREATE THE MODERN FIELD WAS OSTENSIBLY GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW, HE EITHER NEVER REALLY WANTED FORMALISM TO SUCCEED, OR DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE ITS IMPLICATIONS. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION TRULY FORMALIST? WHY DID JUSTICE SCALIA'S VISION FALL SHORT? ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING HIS LEGACY, WHAT TEXTUALISM REALLY IS, AND WHAT HE WANTED IT TO BE. "OF ALL THE CRITICISMS LEVELED AGAINST TEXTUALISM, THE MOST MINDLESS IS THAT IT IS FORMALISTIC.' THE ANSWER TO THAT IS, OF COURSE IT'S FORMALISTIC! THE RULE OF LAW IS ABOUT FORM.... LONG LIVE FORMALISM."
495	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE DETERMINANTS OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS TO THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) REGION OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2010. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY USES A SAMPLE OF 14 SSA COUNTRIES TO ESTIMATE THE BASELINE REGRESSION THROUGH EMPLOYING THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENT DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATION FRAMEWORK. TO CHECK THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE ESTIMATION RESULTS, THE STUDY FURTHER ANALYSES THE DATA SET USING THE RANDOM EFFECTS-GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES (EGLS) ESTIMATOR. THE RANDOM EFFECTS-GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATOR IS ALSO REFERRED TO A THE ESTIMATED GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES (EGLS) ESTIMATOR. FINDINGS - THE PAPER FINDS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS. FURTHERMORE, WHILE THE STUDY SURPRISINGLY FINDS TRADE OPENNESS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP, POLITICAL STABILITY IS FOUND TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH PORTFOLIO EQUITY. TO CHECK FOR THE ROBUSTNESS OF THESE RESULTS, THE AUTHORS FURTHER ANALYSE THE DATA SET USING THE RANDOM EGLS ESTIMATOR. THE RESULT OF THE EGLS ESTIMATOR CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS A ROBUST POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS TO SSA. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NEITHER TRADE OPENNESS NOR POLITICAL STABILITY IS A ROBUST DETERMINANT OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS TO THE SUB-REGION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - POLICY MEASURES SHOULD AIM AT ENHANCING FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. A TRANSPARENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT ENHANCES RULE OF LAW AND DEEPENS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN COUNTRIES IN THE SUB- REGION IS CRITICAL, BUT EVEN MORE CRITICAL IS DEEPENING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, GIVEN THE IMPORTANT ROLE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT PLAYS IN PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS AS SUGGESTED BY THE FINDINGS. A RANGE OF MEASURES AND APPROPRIATE POLICY RESPONSES ARE THEREFORE NEEDED FOR COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TO MANAGE MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY RISKS TO DEEPEN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - MOST STUDIES ON PRIVATE CAPITAL FLOWS TO SSA HAVE FOCUSSED ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FLOWS WITH NO OR SCANTY EVIDENCE ON THE DRIVERS OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY FLOWS. THIS STUDY FILLS THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE.
496	IN ENGLAND AND WALES, A 'WHOLE LIFE ORDER' (WLO) IS A LIFE SENTENCE WITH NO PROSPECT OF PAROLE. AT PRESENT, THE WLO SENTENCING REGIME PROVIDES INSUFFICIENT CLARITY ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA FOR THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS, RENDERING THESE SENTENCES UNREVIEWABLE. INDEED, NO WLO PRISONER HAS EVER BEEN RELEASED. THIS ARTICLE SUBMITS THAT IT IS THE MEANS BY WHICH THE EXECUTIVE AND COURTS PRECLUDE SCRUTINY OF THE WLO REVIEW MECHANISM, AND SO DEVALUE THE SYSTEMIC HEALTH OF OUR LEGAL ORDER BY UNDERMINING RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY, WHICH FORM THE MOST DISQUIETING ASPECTS OF THE REGIME. I SET OUT MY ARGUMENT IN TWO PARTS. PART ONE PROVIDES A HISTORICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WLO SENTENCING REGIME AND ITS IMPACT ON WIDER HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE. A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THIS HISTORY REVEALS THAT WLOS TODAY ARE IRREDUCIBLE AND UNDERSCORED BY THE LONG-TERM ACCUMULATION OF UNACCOUNTABLE EXECUTIVE POWER. PART TWO CONSIDERS WLOS FROM THE POSITION OF THE PHILOSOPHER JOHN RAWLS' THEORY OF 'POLITICAL LIBERALISM' AS APPLIED TO UNDERSTANDINGS OF EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS CONSTITUTIONALISM. ADAPTING RAWLS' EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RECIPROCAL DELIBERATION BETWEEN DIVERSE CITIZENS AND INSTITUTIONS IN MAINTAINING A JUST AND STABLE SOCIETY, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE WLO REGIME AS DERIVING FROM AN INTER-INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL DELIBERATION ABOUT WHETHER THE WLO REGIME COMPLIES WITH THE UK'S HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS. I PROPOSE REFORMS TO THE REVIEWABILITY OF WLO SENTENCES TO GIVE PRISONERS THE 'MEANS' IF NOT NECESSARILY THE 'RESULT' OF RELEASE. RATHER, THERE REMAIN OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE WORST OF THE WORST PRISONERS POSSESS THE CAPACITY FOR REHABILITATION, EVEN IF PROVIDED WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO. AS SUCH, THESE REFORMS CAN BE JUSTIFIED, LESS ON GROUNDS OF ENSURING THE ACTUAL RELEASE OF PRISONERS, BUT MORE AS PART OF RESTORING A BROADER FUNCTIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK.
497	POLAND AND HUNGARY SEEM TO REPRESENT THE SAME TYPE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. IT CAN BE DEFENSIBLY LABELLED AS ILLIBERAL, AS IT IS BASED ON A LONGING FOR A CHARISMATIC LEADER AND SPECIFIC NATIONAL IDENTITY, COMBINING INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM WITH NON-LIBERAL VALUES, AND DISTANCES ITSELF FROM WESTERN STANDARDS COMPRISING THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. WEAK RESTRAINT IS PROVIDED BY EU AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND PROCEDURES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO RECOGNIZE THE TENDENCIES IN LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE IN POLAND SINCE 2015 THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ILLIBERALIZATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, AND INVESTIGATE THEIR ROLE IN DETERIORATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE QUALITY, AND THUS, MAINTENANCE OF ILLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. THESE TENDENCIES ARE DETECTED AS INEQUALITY, DEFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE AND COMPROMISED JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, ACCELERATED AND PURE MAJORITARIAN APPROACH TO LEGISLATION, AND ILLIBERAL CONTENT OF LAWS. IT IS FOUND THAT THE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN FUELLED BY THE MAJORITARIAN VISION OF A STATE COMMUNITY THAT IS EMPHASIZED IN THE POLITICAL NARRATIVE OF THE RULING ALLIANCE. THIS VISION HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING AND SITUATED AGAINST RULE-OF-LAW CONSIDERATIONS. IT GENERATES DE FACTO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE (LGBTQI+), DE IURE INEQUALITIES (RETIREMENT AGE AND PENSION), AND THE WILL OF THE (MAJORITY OF) PEOPLE IS PLACED ABOVE THE CONSTITUTION. A CAPTURED CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS NOT ABLE TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HAS BEEN ACCELERATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL DISCUSSION, CONSULTATION, OR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCEDURE. THE STATUTES ARE ABUSED FOR INFORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OR HAVE SYMBOLIC MEANING WITHOUT PROPER LEGISLATIVE EFFECTIVENESS. LEGISLATION DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS HAS NOT IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF LAWS AT ALL AND COULD NOT PROPERLY ADDRESSED THE CRITICISM EMERGED AFTER SOME EXPERIENCES OF THE PANDEMIC-RELATED FUNCTIONING OF THE PARLIAMENT AND GOVERNMENT. THE COMBINATION OF ALL THESE TENDENCIES MAKES THE POLISH LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE DISTINCTIVE IN ITS ILLIBERAL TONE.
498	TO REDUCE THE FLOW OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IN EUROPE, THERE IS A NEED TO PROMOTE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT. IT IS TO THIS END THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE BY INVESTIGATING THE DETERMINANTS OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT FOR A PANEL OF 35 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2018. THE DETERMINANTS WERE SUB-DIVIDED INTO MACROECONOMIC, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY FACTORS, WHICH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAD FAILED TO CONSIDER. WE SUB-DIVIDED THE DETERMINANTS BECAUSE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR OPERATES WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT OF THESE DETERMINANTS. THEREFORE, INVESTIGATING THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN THE PROCESS OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE PROVIDES INSIGHT TO AREA POLICIES THAT NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED. A BATTERY OF ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES WAS EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY. THE COINTEGRATION RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A LONG RUN EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT AND ITS DETERMINANTS. THE MAIN FINDINGS FROM THE RESULTS OF FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES AND DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REVEAL THAT THE LONG-RUN COEFFICIENTS OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, THE RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT. A MAJORITY OF THE DETERMINANTS HAVE A BIDIRECTIONAL CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WITH RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVEL-OPMENT (EXCEPT FOR REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, LAND, GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, THAT DIFFER. THIS IMPLIES A DEPENDENCE BETWEEN MOST OF THE DETERMINANTS AND RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT. THE SYSTEM-GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS RESULTS SHOW THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DO NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OR POSITIVE/NEGATIVE IMPACT ON RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT, WHILE THE IMPACT OF OTHER DETERMINANTS DIFFER. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONCLUSION SECTION OF THE STUDY.(C) 2022 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

499	THE TYPE OF STATE THAT COLOMBIA MADE SINCE 1991 (RULE OF LAW), IMPLIES THAT THE STATE FULFILL THE OBJECTIVES ARE SHARED WITH THE POPULATION, THUS GENERATING DEGREES OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COSTS BORNE BY THEM AND THE STATE FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE OBJECTIVES. THE SATISFACTION OF PEOPLE'S BASIC NEEDS AS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES OF THE RULE OF LAW, NO EXCEPTION TO THIS SCHEME, WHICH DETERMINES THE HARMONIOUS COOPERATION NOT ONLY BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND AGENCIES OF STATE BUT OF THIS, SUPPLEMENTED BY THE POPULATION. ONE OF THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE POPULATION, REFERS TO THE ABILITY TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS USING THE MECHANISMS FOR THIS PURPOSE IS AVAILABLE, USING THE FORMS OF SELF GOVERNMENT, SELF-RESOLUTION, HYBRID AND HETEROCOMPOSICION, THE STATE AUTHORIZED ACCORDING TO THE GUIDELINES OF EACH MECHANISM WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTERS THAT MAKE SUTANCIALES RIGHTS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT. WITHIN THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS, THE HETEROCOMPOSICI<BOLD>N HAS ONE CALLED THE COURT PROCESS</BOLD>, WHERE A THIRD PARTY VESTED WITH SPECIFIC POWERS AND EXERCISING JURISDICTION, THE DECISION ON THE CONFLICT, AFTER THE EXHAUSTION OF SUCCESSIVE STAGES AND PRECLUSIVE TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION, EXERCISE AND DEFENSE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES AND SUBSTANTIAL, GENERATING GREATER ASSURANCE OF LEGALITY ON THE DECISION GENERATED BY THE THIRD PARTY HAVE FULL JURISDICTION (THE JUDGE). AS THE COURT PROCESS MORE SUITABLE MECHANISM FOR ITS REGULATED STATE PROTECTION AND MODERNIZED, MUST BE PROTECTED, STRENGTHENED AND PREFERRED OVER THE SO-CALLED COURTS AS EQUIVALENT TO THESE THE STATE INTENDS TO DISPLACE COMPETITION WHEN RESOLVING CONFLICTS, CREATING A CLIMATE DISFAVORING DUE PROCESS. THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS NOT DUE TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS AS SUCH BUT TO THE SUM OF SEVERAL HUMAN FACTORS, TECHNICAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE NOT REMEDIED BY DISMISSING THE USE OF THIS-THE PROCESS, OTHER MECHANISMS TO ENCOURAGE LESS OFFER GUARANTEES WHICH MAY BECOME SHARPEN MORE CONFLICTS.
500	"AD HOC PROCEDURE" SEEMS LIKE AN OXYMORON. A TRADITIONAL MODEL OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM DEPICTS COURTS DECIDING CASES USING IMPARTIAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE DEFINED IN ADVANCE OF SPECIFIC DISPUTES. THIS MODEL REFLECTS A PROCESS-BASED ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN WHICH THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH LAWS ARE MADE HELPS TO ENSURE THAT LAWMAKERS ACT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. JUDGMENTS PRODUCED USING PROCEDURES PROMULGATED IN ADVANCE OF SPECIFIC DISPUTES ARE LEGITIMATE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF FAIR RULES OF PLAY DESIGNED IN A MANNER THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF AD HOC.& PARA;& PARA;ACTUAL LITIGATION FREQUENTLY REVEALS THE INADEQUACY OF PROCEDURES CREATED ACCORDING TO THIS TRADITIONAL MODEL. TO FIX THE PROCEDURAL PROBLEM S THAT ARISE IN SUCH CASES, LITIGANTS, JUDGES, LAWYERS, AND LEGISLATURES CAN DESIGN PROCEDURE ON THE FLY, CHANGING THE "RULES OF THE ROAD" AS THE CASE PROCEEDS. AD HOC PROCEDURE-MAKING ALLOWS THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION WHEN ORDINARY PROCEDURE FAILS, BUT IT CHALLENGES THE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES REFLECTED IN THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF PROCEDURAL DESIGN. INSTEAD OF BEING CREATED BY LAWMAKERS WHO OPERATE BEHIND A VEIL OF IGNORANCE, AD HOC PROCEDURE IS MADE BY ACTORS SEEKING SPECIFIC OUTCOMES IN PENDING CASES. THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH AD HOC PROCEDURE IS CREATED RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT LAWMAKERS' MOTIVATIONS, THE TRANSACTION COSTS OF ONE-OFF PROCEDURAL INTERVENTIONS, THE WISDOM AND FAIRNESS OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS, AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.& PARA;& PARA;THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE PHENOMENON OF AD HOC PROCEDURE AND CONSIDERS ITS PLACE IN A WORLD WHERE MUCH PROCEDURE CONTINUES TO BE MADE THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL MODEL. FOCUSING ON AD HOC PROCEDURAL STATUTES, THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT SUCH STATUTES' LEGITIMACY-OR LACK THEREOF-DEPENDS ON DIFFERENT FACTORS THAN ORDINARY CIVIL PROCEDURE. UNABLE TO CLAIM LEGITIMACY FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH IT IS CRAFTED, AD HOC PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION MUST INSTEAD DERIVE LEGITIMACY FROM THE NEED TO ADDRESS A PROCEDURAL PROBLEM AND THE EFFORT TO PRODUCE SUBSTANTIVELY JUST OUTCOMES.
501	THIS REVIEW ESSAY USES MARIANA MAZZUCATO, THE VALUE OF EVERYTHING: MAKING AND TAKING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY (PENGUIN BOOKS, 2018), AND WILLIAM DAVIES, THE LIMITS OF NEOLIBERALISM: AUTHORITY, SOVEREIGNTY, AND THE LOGIC OF COMPETITION (SAGE, 2017) TO ILLUSTRATE THE END RESULTS OF HISTORICAL CHANGES STARTING IN THE 18TH CENTURY, PRIMARILY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY IN BRITAIN AND AMERICA, IN IDEAS ON SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND ECONOMIC VALUE THAT HAVE INFLUENCED JURISPRUDENCE RELATING TO THE PLACE OF GOVERNMENT IN SETTING STANDARDS AND REGULATING ECONOMIC MARKETS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A CULTURAL EVOLUTION FROM THE VALUES OF LIBERALISM, WHERE THE ECONOMY IS MADE SAFE FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF SOCIETY AS RULED BY GOVERNMENT, IN ESSENCE THEIR VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, TO THE VALUES OF NEOLIBERALISM WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS MADE SAFE FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF MARKETS, THUS ANOTHER VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PREPARATORY MATERIAL SETS THE STAGE FOR DISCUSSING THE RECENT BOOK BY JOSEPH FISHKIN AND WILLIAM E. FORBATH, THE ANTI-OLIGARCHY CONSTITUTION: RECONSTRUCTING THE ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2022) WHERE THEY VERY MUCH MAKE THE CASE THAT THE EARLY AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION EMBODIES WHAT I CALL CLASSICAL LIBERAL VALUES THAT EMPHASIZE THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT FOR REDUCING SOCIAL CLASS TENSIONS BY LIMITING THE GROWTH OF MALDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND POWER AND THE GROWTH OF OLIGARCHY. THEY CLAIM THIS ORIGINAL TRADITION HAS BEEN SEVERELY UNDERCUT BY VALUES THAT PUT ECONOMIC MARKETS ON A PEDESTAL SO THAT IN MANY WAYS THEY UNDERCUT AND SUBSTITUTE FOR GOVERNMENTAL ACTION IN PRODUCING ECONOMIC JUSTICE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE WEAKEN THE GROWTH OF OLIGARCHY. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS REACHED THE POINT THAT THE VALUES OF NEOLIBERALISM HAVE STARTED TO REPLACE THE VALUES OF CLASSICAL LIBERALISM AS FUNDAMENTAL SOURCES OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION, A DEVELOPMENT THAT EXISTED IN THE PAST, BUT THAT HAS GAINED MAJOR STRENGTH MORE RECENTLY, PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE LAST GENERATION. I THEN DISCUSS FRANCIS FUKUYAMA, LIBERALISM AND ITS DISCONTENTS (FARRAR, STRAUS AND GIROUX, 2022) AS A BOOK THAT EXEMPLIFIES CLASSICAL LIBERAL IDEALS WHILE DISCUSSING ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES MOSTLY IN A BROAD SENSE.
502	THE SUBJECT OF JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO THE MILITARY IN TIME OF WAR HAS SPAWNED A RICH AND VARIEGATED LITERATURE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ARTICLES HAVE FOCUSED UPON WHAT ONE MIGHT TERM "LEGAL DEFERENCE," OR COURTS' WILLINGNESS TO CONSTRUE THE MILITARY'S STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY BROADLY, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY NARROWING THE LEGAL RESTRAINTS UPON ITS ACTIONS. THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS A DIVERGENT APPROACH, TAKING AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE MODEM WARTIME JURISPRUDENCE IS DEFINED AS MUCH BY THE MANNER IN WHICH COURTS TREAT THE EXECUTIVE'S FACTUAL ASSERTIONS AS THE FASHION IN WHICH THOSE COURTS HAVE CONSTRUED THE LEGAL LIMITATIONS AND EMPOWERMENTS OF THOSE SAME MILITARY ACTORS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE COURTS HAVE APPLIED TO THE PRESIDENT'S AND THE MILITARY'S FACTUAL DETERMINATIONS DURING WARTIME. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT BY OVEREMPHASIZING BOTH THE EXECUTIVE'S "SPECIAL CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE" IN MILITARY AFFAIRS AND ITS COMPARATIVE EXPERTISE AT EVALUATING POTENTIAL DANGERS TO NATIONAL SECURITY, THE JUDICIARY HAS REFUSED TO SUBJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S FACTUAL PREDICATES TO MEANINGFUL SCRUTINY, NEITHER DEMANDING SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BEFORE ACCEPTING A FACTUAL ASSERTION AS CORRECT NOR EXAMINING THE LOGIC AND RATIONALITY BEHIND EXECUTIVE CLAIMS OF DANGER AND NECESSITY. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES EMPLOYING THE CLOSELY ANALOGOUS, THOUGH RARELY APPLIED, FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AS A NOVEL JURIDICAL PARADIGM FOR DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE DUE THE MILITARY'S WARTIME FACTUAL CONCLUSIONS. WHILE EXTANT "MILITARY" JURIS -PRUDENCE HAS CHAINED COURTS TO A DEFERENTIAL RUBRIC THAT DOES LITTLE TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST AN OVERZEALOUS OR PREVARICATING EXECUTIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS CONSTRUCTED A RATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF FACTUAL DEFERENCE THAT AFFORDS APPROPRIATE LATITUDE TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES' EXERCISE OF THEIR EXPERTISE AND CONGRESS'S INTENTION TO EMPOWER THEM TO UTILIZE THAT PARTICULARIZED COMPETENCE-WHILE RESTRAINING ASSESSMENTS AND ACTIVITIES RENDERED ILLEGITIMATE BY CONTROLLING LEGAL AUTHORITY. DIRECT APPLICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'S PRINCIPLES TO WARTIME ADJUDICATIONS HOLDS THE PROMISE OF SUPPLYING A COHERENT THEORY OF DEFERENCE TO REAFFIRM THE RULE OF LAW IN A JURISPRUDENTIAL FIELD THAT HAS WITNESSED A SLOW MARCH AWAY FROM THOSE CORE PRINCIPLES.
503	GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE IS THE CONCRETIZATION OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS INTERACT WITH AND COORDINATE OCEAN ISSUES. GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE IS INEVITABLY LINKED TO THE NEW GLOBAL GOVERNANCE LANDSCAPE. IN RECENT YEARS, A SERIES OF NEW SCENARIOS IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE HAVE EMERGED. THESE SITUATIONS HAVE FURTHER SHAPED THE PLURALITY OF PARTICIPANTS AND THE DIVERSITY OF MECHANISMS IN GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND APPLICATION ARE PREREQUISITES AND PRIME MOVERS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. MAJOR WORLDWIDE CRISES, REPRESENTED BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 PANDEMIC, HAVE ADDED GREAT UNCERTAINTY TO THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THE DIVERGENCE OF INTERESTS AND POSITIONS BETWEEN EMERGING COUNTRIES AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE RESHAPING OF THE GLOBAL GEOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN RECENT YEARS, HAS LED TO THE STAGNATION OR DEADLOCK OF A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION PLATFORMS RELATED TO GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. WITH THE DEEPENING OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, NON-STATE ACTORS ARE NOT ONLY OBJECTS OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE BUT ALSO BEARERS OF LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND ENJOY VARYING DEGREES OF LEGAL RIGHTS, PARTICIPATING IN AGENDA SETTING, RULE CONSTRUCTION, AND MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE. FROM A CRITICAL JURISPRUDENCE PERSPECTIVE, IN THE PRACTICE OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, STATES, AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IS MORE LIKELY TO BE ONE OF RECONCILIATION THAN THE "STATE-CIVIL SOCIETY" DICHOTOMY OF MORAL IMAGINATION. THIS NEW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES EXPOSES THE DIVISIVE AND FRAGMENTED NATURE OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE NEW SITUATION OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE CONSTITUTES A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTRIES TO REEXAMINE THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW DURING THE ANTHROPOCENE TO BRIDGE THE FRAGMENTATION AND GAPS IN MECHANISMS AND ACHIEVE A TRULY INTEGRATED, HOLISTIC, AND CLOSELY NESTED GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THE QUESTION OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE INTRODUCTION OF THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES SUCH AS THE ANTHROPOCENE, COMPLEX SYSTEMS THEORY, AND THE COMMUNITY OF A SHARED FUTURE FOR HUMANITY TO UNDERTAKE A FUNDAMENTAL CRITICAL REFLECTION AND RETHINKING OF GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE.
504	THE SCIENCE OF LABOUR LAW DISTINGUISHES, AMONG OTHERS, BETWEEN PROCEDURAL RULES OF LAW. ACCORDING TO LABOUR SCIENTISTS, PROCEDURAL RULES STREAMLINE, ENSURE AND GUARANTEE THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE SUBSTANTIVE NORMS OF LABOUR LAW AND DETERMINE THE PROCEDURE FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF SUBJECTS TO ENFORCE THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ENSHRINED IN THE REGULATORY SUBSTANTIVE NORMS. THE SUBJECT OF LEGAL REGULATION IS THE ACTIVITY OF CREATING SUBSTANTIVE NORMS OF LABOUR LAW AND ENSURING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, AS WELL AS THE ACTIVITY OF NON-JURISDICTIONAL BODIES INVOLVED IN RESOLVING INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE LABOUR DISPUTES. THE DEFINITIONS OF PROCEDURAL NORMS PROPOSED BY SEVERAL AUTHORS ULTIMATELY BOIL DOWN TO THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE LEGAL NORM. IT IS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO AGREE THAT PROCEDURAL NORMS ARE A SEPARATE KIND OF LEGAL NORM. THE SEPARATION OF PROCEDURAL NORMS IS UNLIKELY TO BE JUSTIFIED SIMPLY BECAUSE ANY NORM OF LABOUR LAW CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD, LET ALONE IMPLEMENTED, IN ISOLATION FROM THE PROCEDURE FOR ITS APPLICATION. SINCE THE SEPARATION OF PROCEDURAL NORMS IS QUESTIONABLE, THE THEORY OF THE AUTONOMY OF LABOUR PROCEDURAL LAW CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED. THE FEATURES OF THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF LABOUR LAW REFLECTED IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARE THE FEATURES OF THE PROCEDURES OF LABOUR LAW. PROCEDURES OF LABOUR LAW ARE PART OF THE LOGICAL NORM AND ARE CONTAINED IN ITS DISPOSITION. PROCEDURES OF LABOUR LAW ARE THE LEGAL MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING SUBSTANTIVE OR PROCEDURAL NORMS OF LABOUR LAW AND THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN THE LAW AND ORDER IN THE COMPANY (OR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER). AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PART OF THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL REGULATION, THE PROCEDURE ENSURES ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THE MORE DETAILED THE PROCEDURE IN THE RULE OF LAW IS, THE FEWER DISPUTES ARISE BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP, WHICH HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. LEGAL PROVISIONS "NEED" PROCEDURES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL PROVISIONS, BECAUSE IT IS THE PROCEDURES THAT "ANIMATE" THE PROVISION AND ALLOW IT TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULT.
505	TRUST IS A BASIC ELEMENT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, OF A PERSON'S RELATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL AS SOCIAL RELATIONS. IT IS A NORMED AND PROTECTED VALUE, AMONG OTHERS IN CIVIL, CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND. THE DESCRIBED LEGAL REGULATIONS ARE BASED ON AN EMPIRICAL ASSUMPTION THAT MORAL SENSITIVITY, HONESTY AND HUMAN CONSCIENCE DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY GUARANTEE RESPECTING THE RIGHTS AND GOODS OF OTHER LEGAL ENTITIES. DETAILED LEGAL REGULATIONS AND JURISDICTION OF AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT COURTS ARE STILL NEEDED. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE CONCEPT OF CITIZEN'S TRUST IN THE STATE AND THE RULE OF LAW, FORMULATED IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL, AND ITS CRITICISM IN THE SCIENCE OF LAW. CONFRONTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL IDEA OF TRUST WITH THE POLISH POLITICAL REALITY SHOWS THAT EVEN JUDGMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DO NOT ALWAYS INSPIRE TRUST IF THEY ARE PASSED BY A MAJORITY OF VOTES WITH NUMEROUS DISSENTING OPINIONS ATTACHED. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, RESPECTING THE NATURAL HUMAN RIGHT TO LEGAL SECURITY BY THE STATE IS A MORE SOLID BASIS FOR EFFECTIVE TRUST IN CITIZEN-STATE RELATIONS THAN THE LINK BETWEEN TRUST AND THE RULE OF LAW CLAUSE DETACHED FROM SOCIAL REALITY. THE RULES OF DECENT LEGISLATION ARE A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALISM AND A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE AXIOLOGY OF A REPUBLICAN STATE AS A COMMON GOOD. WITH REFERENCE TO THE RECENT YEARS' CRISIS REGARDING THE JUDICIARY (THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE SUPREME COURT AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY), WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GUARANTOR OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO LEGAL SECURITY, THE AUTHOR PROPOSES SOME POSITIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE FORM OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES. REAL TRUST IN RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE, AND ALSO IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, DOES NOT RESULT FROM PROVISIONS OF LAW, THE CONSTITUTION AND CODES, BUT FROM AN INDIVIDUAL'S FREEDOM, RESPONSIBILITY AND PURSUIT OF GOOD, STEMMING FROM NATURAL LAW.
506	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CORPORATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (ETR) AND SEVERAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN THE G7 AND THE BRIC COUNTRIES (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, AND CHINA). WE USE THE PANEL DATA METHODOLOGY WITH A DATA SAMPLE OF 25,878 LISTED FIRMS IN 2010-2018. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL THE VARIABLES ANALYZED HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ETR. SOME-SUCH AS THE STATUTORY TAX RATE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND OPEN MARKETS-AFFECT ALL COUNTRIES, WHEREAS OTHERS, SUCH AS CORRUPTION CONTROL AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AFFECT ONLY THE BRIC COUNTRIES, AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, THE DEFICIT, AND GROSS DEBT ONLY AFFECT THE G7 COUNTRIES. & COPY; 2023 THE AUTHOR(S).

507	THE STARTING POINT MUST BE WHAT THE I.C.J. HAD TO SAY IN THE FIRST CONTINENTAL SHELF DELIMITATION CASE DECIDED BY IT : THE 1969 NORTH SEA CONTINENTAL SHELF CASES DENMARK VS F.R.G. THE COURT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO SINGLE METHOD OF DELIMITATION WHICH IS OBLIGATORY IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. ALSO THE COURT STATED THAT THE STATE PRACTICE IN THE SENSE OF BEING "EXTENSIVE'" AND "VIRTUALLY UNIFORM" WITH REGARD TO THE METHOD OF DELIMITATION EMPLOYED. EVIDENCE MUST EXIST THAT THE STATES CONCERNED CONSIDERED THAT THE USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF DELIMITATION WAS RENDERED OBLIGATORY BY THE EXISTENCE OF A RULE OF LAW REQUIRING IT. THE COURT AND OTHER ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS HAVE HAD NO HESITATION IN BORROWING LIBERALLY FROM IT TO JUSTIFY THE USE OF PARTICULAR METHODS OF DELIMITATION IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
508	THIS ARTICLE ENDEAVORS TO DEAL WITH THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE APPROACH OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO TRACE THE CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES. IT SUGGESTS THAT WHAT IS REQUIRED IS THE EVENTUAL CONVERGENCE OF THE POSITIVE VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY (RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS) AND POSITIVE SOUTHEAST ASIAN VALUES (RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY, STRONG FAMILIES, AND REVERENCE FOR EDUCATION, HARD WORK, FRUGALITY, AND TEAM WORK). THAT IS, THE POSITIVE VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ARE REQUIRED FOR THE ASSURANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, AND POSITIVE SOUTHEAST ASIAN VALUES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF CULTURAL IDENTITY. NONETHELESS, THIS ARTICLE ARTICULATES THAT DEMOCRACY DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO THE ASSURANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
509	WHILE THE CANCELLATION OF A NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILE LOANS BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION CONCERNS HAS MADE HEADLINE NEWS, THE WORLD BANK'S PRINCIPAL APPROACH TO POORLY GOVERNED COUNTRIES IS LENDING IN ORDER TO SUPPORT REFORMS. ALTHOUGH DESIGNED TO BE AN APOLITICAL TECHNOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT FINANCIER, INCREASINGLY THE BANK HAS FOCUSED ITS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES ON PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN ITS BORROWERS. BANK LAWYERS AND PRESIDENTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO HIVE OF APOLITICAL ASPECTS OF GOVERNANCE BY ARGUING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE POLITICAL CHARACTER OF GOVERNMENT, BUT THIS DISTINCTION IS ILLUSORY. THE BANK'S INABILITY TO ADDRESS THE POLITICAL EMBEDDEDNESS OF POOR GOVERNANCE IN NEO-PATRIMONIAL GOVERNMENTS SKEWS RISK ASSESSMENTS AND IMPEDES THE FORMATION OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES. REFORM OF THE CHARTER WOULD NOT ELIMINATE THE BANK'S BUREAUCRATIC AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS.
510	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMPARATIVE DEMOCRATISATION LITERATURE BY ANALYSING THE USE OF NON-VIOLENT METHODS OF RESISTANCE IN A REPRESSIVE POLITICAL REGIME. IT FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF YOUTH MOVEMENTS IN ELECTIONS IN BELARUS. ELECTIONS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ENGAGEMENT OF YOUTH IN POLITICS. THE STUDY EXAMINES HOW THE YOUTH MOVEMENTS MALADY FRONT, ZUBR AND BELARUSIAN PATRIOTIC YOUTH UNION SOUGHT TO MOBILISE YOUNG PEOPLE DURING THE 2001 ELECTION. IT ANALYSES MOVEMENT TACTICS AND STATE ACTION IN RESPONSE TO YOUTH MOBILISATION.
511	I ADDRESS MAJOR CHALLENGES TO DEALING WITH CONTENTIOUS PUBLIC ISSUES BY REPLACING THICK NORMS WITH THIN ONES: (1) SECULARISM, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, EQUAL RIGHTS, AND RULE OF LAW LEND THEMSELVES TO POLITICS MORE THIN THAN THICK; DOES THIS CONDEMN THE APPROACH TO ITS OWN KIND OF THICKNESS? (2) IF THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL, AND IF THE INDIVIDUAL'S PRIMARY PROJECT IS HIS OR HER LIBERTY, MUST THIS APPROACH THREATEN THE COMMUNITARIAN SELF-UNDERSTANDINGS OF SOME GROUPS? (3) DOES IT FUNDAMENTALIZE POLITICAL LIBERALISM? (4) WHAT ABOUT ADDRESSEES LIKELY TO REJECT THIN NORMS, SUCH AS PERSONS GUIDED BY AN OTHERWORLDLY AUTHORITY OR AN AUTHORITARIAN IDEOLOGY? (5) IS THIS APPROACH DEFEATED WHERE TERRITORIALIZED MEMBERSHIP RIGHTS CLASH WITH THIN NORMS, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION: A POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC COMMUNITY INTERNALLY SOMEWHAT THIN YET EXTERNALLY THICK?
512	RECENT GLOBAL CORRUPTION AND MONEY LAUNDERING SCANDALS HAVE INCLUDED INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ASSOCIATIONS. THE ASTRONOMICAL ECONOMIC FIGURES THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS MANAGE HAVE BEEN THE BASIS OF THEIR POLITICAL POWER AND HAVE BEEN VERY ATTRACTIVE TO CRIMINALS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERPETRATING DIFFERENT CRIMES USING INNOVATIVE GADGETS, SHOWING THE SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS IN THE ABSENCE OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY STANDARDS THAT DEMAND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CORRUPT PRACTICES IN COUNTRIES THAT HOST MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS HAVE UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW AND HAVE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THEIR CITIZENS, WHICH IS WHY THEY CURRENTLY REPRESENT A TRUE GLOBAL THREAT. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH LIES IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE GLOBAL IMPACT CAUSED IN SOCCER DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS AND THE COMPARISON OF THE LEGAL VACUUM THAT ALSO EXISTS IN ECUADOR IN THIS SECTOR.
513	WE STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME INEQUALITY AND ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY IN MEXICAN STATES BETWEEN 2004 AND 2019. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY IS STATISTICALLY RELATED TO INEQUALITY; THAT IS, STATES WITH MORE DIVERSIFIED AND SOPHISTICATED ECONOMIC STRUCTURES (MORE COMPLEX ECONOMIES) TEND TO HAVE FAIRER INCOME DISTRIBUTION. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF A LOCAL SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT OF ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY; IN SHORT, A STATES LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY IS NOT ONLY RELATED TO ITS OWN LEVEL OF ECONOMIC COMPLEXITY BUT ALSO ITS NEIGHBOURS' LEVEL. EMPLOYING PANEL METHODS, OUR ESTIMATIONS USE CONTROL VARIABLES THAT OTHER SIMILAR STUDIES HAVE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT, SUCH AS GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, POPULATION, EDUCATION, CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS ARE RELEVANT FOR POLICYMAKERS IN ORDER TO ADAPT POLICIES TO REDUCE INEQUALITY.
514	JEREMY WALDRON HAS ARGUED THAT BERLIN IGNORED THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONS AND CONSTITUTIONS AND WORKED WITH AN IMPOVERISHED CONCEPTION OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DESIGN. POLITICAL STRUCTURES, LEGAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, MECHANISMS OF REPRESENTATION AND THE RULE OF LAW: ALL THIS REMAINED UNTOUCHED BY BERLIN, WHO SEEMED, IN WALDRON'S OPINION, LARGELY UNINTERESTED IN THE ACTUAL POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL SOCIETY. IN THIS ESSAY, I ARGUE THAT WHAT MAY BE MISSING IN BERLIN-CLOSE AND SUSTAINED ATTENTION TO, AND INTEREST IN, INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL CONTEXT-CAN BE FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HIS PROMINENT CONTEMPORARY, RAYMOND ARON (1905-1983), WHO ALSO WROTE ABOUT LIBERTY DURING THE COLD WAR. AS SUCH, ARON'S AN ESSAY ON LIBERTY CAN AND SHOULD BE READ AS A COMPLEMENT TO BERLIN'S ESSAY "TWO CONCEPTS OF LIBERTY."
515	THE FOUNDING OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA IN 1918 WAS BASED ON TWO OBJECTIVES: THE CREATION OF A NATION WITH A SLAVIC MAJORITY IN ETHNICALLY MIXED CENTRAL EUROPE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE ARMED AGAINST REVISIONISM ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO LOST THE FIRST WORLD WAR. THE EXPULSION OF THE GERMANS IN 1945-1946 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR, IN PARTICULAR CHANGES IN GERMANY'S UNDERSTANDING OF ITSELF, DEPRIVED THE COMMON STATE OF CZECHS AND SLOVAKS OF ITS BASIS TO EXIST. AFTER THE VELVET REVOLUTION IN 1989, A SWIFT VELVET SEPARATION FOLLOWED UNDER DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S BALANCE SHEET IN MATTERS OF SECURITY, WELFARE, AND THE RULE OF LAW IS BY NO MEANS UNAMBIGUOUSLY NEGATIVE, THIS STATE HAD LOST ITS CENTRAL FUNCTION.
516	AT THE THEORETICAL LEVEL, EVEN IF POPULISM AND DEMOCRACY ARE NOT NECESSARILY ANTITHETICAL, THE FORMER CHALLENGES THE LIBERAL COMPONENT OF DEMOCRACY, ADVOCATING FOR THE MAJORITY RULE AND PUTTING UNDER STRESS THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND POPULISM, WE CREATED FOUR NEW QUESTIONS THAT MEASURE THE SUPPORT FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY CONCEIVED AS A TRADE-OFF WITH DIFFERENT POLICIES. WE TESTED OUR BATTERY OF QUESTIONS IN A PILOT SURVEY WITH EDUCATED YOUNG VOTERS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO EXHIBIT LOWER LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ARE THE ONES WITH HIGHER POPULIST ATTITUDES. THIS MIGHT BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL BATTERY OF QUESTIONS GRASPS THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BETTER THAN THE STANDARD 'CHURCHILLIAN' QUESTION.
517	THE PROSECUTION OF CRIMINAL SUSPECTS IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF A COUNTRY'S JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHILE SUBSTANTIAL SCHOLARLY ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF THE POLICE AND JUDGES AND THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, SURPRISINGLY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PROSECUTORS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS FILLING THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP. WE FIRST DEMONSTRATE THE RISING IMPORTANCE OF PROSECUTORS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD. WE IDENTIFY THE INDEPENDENCE OF PROSECUTION AGENCIES FROM THE OTHER TWO BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AS A CENTRALLY IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC AND THEN PROCEED TO ANALYSE THE DETERMINANTS OF DE FACTO PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE FROM A POLITICAL ECONOMY PERSPECTIVE. WE FIND THAT PRESS FREEDOM, THE IMMUNITY OF PARLIAMENTARIANS AND BELONGING TO THE COMMON LAW TRADITION ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER DE FACTO INDEPENDENCE.
518	DRAWING FROM COURTROOM DISCOURSES IN THE PETITION OFFICE OF A CHINESE COURT, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES AN EMERGING POLITICISED LEGAL DISCOURSE, DEPLOYED BY JUDGES TO ACCOMMODATE PETITIONERS. EMBEDDED IN THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA, THIS DISCOURSE RECONCILES THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW POLICY AND THE STABILITY MAINTENANCE CONCERNS AND ENFORCES THE OFFICIAL PERSPECTIVE OF LEGALITY. TO CONSTRUCT A "LAWFUL" CLAIM AND RELIEVE PETITIONERS WITH REFERENCE TO THE LAW, PETITIONERS ARE DIVERTED TO EXHAUST ROUTINE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND TO PURSUE RETRIALS, MOST OF WHICH END UP FRUITLESS. IN THIS PROCESS OF LEGALITY CONSTRUCTION, PETITIONERS' RESISTANCE AGAINST THE OFFICIAL DISCOURSE DOMINANCE IS DEFINED AS UNLAWFUL OR EVEN CRIMINALISED, AND THEIR VOICING OF GRIEVANCES IS OPPRESSED. THE FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS SHED LIGHT ON HOW THE LAW MATTERS TO THE MANAGEMENT OF POPULAR RESISTANCE IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES.
519	AS A RESULT OF THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS AND THE BOMBINGS IN MADRID AND LONDON, A PREVENTION-FOCUSED COUNTER-TERRORISM APPROACH HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. PREVENTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM IS APPEALING BECAUSE IT IMPLIES INTERVENTIONS THAT REMOVE THE ABILITY OR, BETTER STILL, THE MOTIVATION OF POTENTIAL TERRORISTS TO CARRY OUT THEIR LETHAL DESIGNS. MEMBER STATES SUCH AS THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS THAT PRIMARILY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN ADDRESSING 'HOME-GROWN' TERRORISM, HAVE DEVELOPED PREVENTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM MEASURES IN RESPONSE. EVEN THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, IT REMAINS RELEVANT TO EXAMINE WHETHER IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE PARTICULAR MEASURES HAVE HAD DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECTS ON ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND THEREBY VIOLATE NON-DISCRIMINATION STANDARDS.
520	IN BAHRAIN LAST YEAR, CITIZENS ELECTED THEIR OWN PARLIAMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY THREE DECADES. OMAN HAS EXTENDED THE VOTE TO ALL ADULT CITIZENS; QATAR HAS A NEW CONSTITUTION; YEMEN HAS A MULTIPARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM; KUWAIT HAS A DIRECTLY ELECTED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; AND JORDAN HELD HISTORIC ELECTIONS THIS SUMMER. RECENT SURVEYS IN ARAB NATIONS REVEAL BROAD SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL PLURALISM, THE RULE OF LAW, AND FREE SPEECH. THESE ARE THE STIRRINGS OF MIDDLE EASTERN DEMOCRACY, AND THEY CARRY THE PROMISE OF GREATER CHANGE TO COME. IN FULL-BLOWN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, FORMAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS ELECTIONS, PARLIAMENTS, AND COURTS EITHER DO NOT EXIST OR EXIST MERELY AS FACADES OR LEGITIMATING MECHANISMS. THEY DO NOT YIELD MEANINGFUL CONTESTATION FOR POWER OR GENERATE UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO THE ALLOCATION OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY.
521	A JURIDICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SCHEME OF POWERS BETWEEN COMPETENT AUTHORITIES, CREATED BY A RULE OF LAW, IS ESSENTIALLY LINKED TO THE QUESTION OF GOVERNANCE. WHEN THIS IS A EUROPEAN RULE CONSISTING OF A DIRECTIVE CREATING THE FRAMEWORK OF REALISATION OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS, A DEEPLY LECTURE OF THIS PERMITS TO REVEAL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VERY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE. AMONG THESE, THE ANALYSIS OF THE DIRECTIVE 2002/22 CALLED "DIRECTIVE OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE IN THE SECTOR OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS" SHOWS THAT, IN THIS MATTER, THE SCHEME OF THE RESPECTIVE POWERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE MEMBER STATES CONSISTS OF AUTONOMY AND CONSTRAINTS, DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT CONCERNS THE DEFINITION OF THE CONTENT OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF UNIVERSAL SERVICE OR THE MEANS OF REALISATION OF THEM.
522	IN THIS STUDY, WE COMBINE THE NATIONAL INVESTOR RELATIONS INSTITUTE INDEX OF MARKETIZATION OF CHINA'S PROVINCES 2016 REPORT WITH NANKAI UNIVERSITY'S INVESTOR RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT INDEX TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF INVESTOR RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT ON FIRM-SPECIFIC STOCK RETURN VARIATION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FIRM'S INVESTOR RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT AND THE MAGNITUDE OF FIRM-SPECIFIC RETURN VARIATION IN ITS STOCK. OUR RESULTS FURTHER SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS IN CHINA DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. SPECIFICALLY, FIRMS IN REGIONS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF MARKETIZATION, A HIGH DEGREE OF RULE OF LAW, AND A LOW DEGREE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION EXHIBIT A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS AND CORPORATE MANAGERS AND HELP ENHANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FIRM VALUATION.
523	IN RECENT YEARS, WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S STOCK MARKET AND THE AWAKENING OF INVESTORS' AWARENESS OF PROTECTION, THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC ENFORCEMENTS IN THE CHINESE PUBLIC SECURITIES MARKET HAVE EXPLODED, AND THE PRIMARY REGULATOR OF THE SECURITIES TRADING, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION (CSRC) HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN PROVIDING REMEDIES FOR INVESTORS. IT SEEMS THAT THE QUALITY OF RULE OF LAW IN ENFORCING SECURITIES LAW OF THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED. HOWEVER, BASED ON A CAREFUL ANALYSIS ON A SERIES OF THE CASES, THIS STATEMENT MAY NOT BE QUITE ACCURATE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEEPLY EXPLORE THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIRECTING THE ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITIES LAW IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA BY EXAMINING THE TWO LANDMARK JUDICIAL CASES OCCURRED IN THE RECENT YEARS.
524	THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH SUDAN AND THE POLITICAL TUMULT IN WHICH IT HAS LANDED THE COUNTRY. IN PARTICULAR, IT LOOKS AT THE CONTENTIOUS PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 101(R) AND (S) OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH GIVE THE PRESIDENT POWERS TO REMOVE AN ELECTED STATE GOVERNOR AND APPOINT A NEW GOVERNOR, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A CRISIS WHOSE NATURE IS UNDEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND REMAINS INTELLECTUALLY INCONCEIVABLE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE PROVISIONS CONCENTRATE POLITICAL POWER IN THE HANDS OF PRESIDENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY UNDERMINE THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY. IN CONCLUSION, IT ARGUES FOR THE ADOPTION OF A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION AND A FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AS THE SOLUTION TO THE CONCENTRATION OF POLITICAL POWER IN JUBA.
525	FOR YEARS AND AT PRESENT, ARTICLE 25 OF THE CONSTITUTION - ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE THAT SOMEHOW REGULATES THE LIABILITY OF OFFICIALS TO THE ADMINISTRATION - HAS BEEN AND IS A PERMANENT FORGOTTEN, WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS DESPITE BEING INCORPORATED IN OUR CHARTER SINCE 1952. HIS FORGETFULNESS OR INAPPLICABILITY PROMOTES AND FAVORS, WITHOUT DOUBT, THE EXISTENCE OF "ISLANDS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY" AND "IRRESPONSIBLE SUBJECTS AND REDOUBTS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY" SO CALLED BY OUR MOST PROMINENT DOCTRINE. IN THIS WORK WE ADDRESS THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOR RECOURSE AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS, COVERING THE RELEVANT DOCTRINES AND JURISPRUDENTIAL POSITIONS, SPECIAL CAUTION IN THEIR BUDGETS AND CONDITIONS AND THE PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE TO PREVENT AND COMBAT SUCH REDOUBTS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY AND IMPUNITY, SO AS TO STRENGTHEN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW.
526	WE ANALYZE HOW GOVERNANCE MAY INFLUENCE COMPETING LAND USES FOR FORESTS, AND THUS THE OCCURRENCE OF FOREST TRANSITIONS, ACROSS DIFFERENT LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. WE DEVELOP A MODEL OF COMPETING LAND USES THAT ALLOWS FOR GOVERNANCE TO IMPACT THE RISK OF FUTURE VERSUS CURRENT AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTED LAND ALLOCATIONS. THE RESULTING HYPOTHESIS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FOREST TRANSITION IS THEN TESTED USING CROSS-COUNTRY DATA. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OFFERS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE COMPETING LAND USE FRAMEWORK, AND INDICATES THAT RULE OF LAW, FOREST POLICY AND REGULATORY QUALITY INFLUENCE FOREST TRANSITIONS. THESE FINDINGS INFORM NOT ONLY THE ONGOING DEBATE ON FOREST TRANSITIONS BUT ALSO POLICY OPTIONS FOR MANAGING SUCH TRANSITIONS IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
527	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE STATEMENTS OF THOMAS MANN ON THE LAW DURING THE YEARS OF HIS EXILE. MANN WAS NEITHER A LAWYER NOR, INITIALLY, PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN LEGAL TOPICS. BUT HIS EXILE LED TO A REMARKABLE REVALUATION OF THE IDEA OF LAW. IN 1933, HE SOON REALIZED THAT THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST REGIME HAD SET OUT TO DESTROY THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. SO GERMANY HAD CEASED TO BE A NATION UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THIS BELIEF REMAINED A FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF MANN'S VIEW OF GERMANY BETWEEN 1933 AND 1945. IN THE USA, TOO, HE KEPT AN EYE ON CONGRESSIONAL POLITICS AND LEGISLATION, DEFENDING THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO 'THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS', AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE WAY IT WAS BEING ERODED UNDER MCCARTHYISM.
528	PUBLIC AUTHORITIES' COMPLIANCE WITH JUDICIAL DICTATES IS CENTRAL TO LEGALITY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY, MAY INFLUENCE BROADER POLICY AND POLITICAL OUTCOMES, AND CAN HAVE POWERFUL FEEDBACK EFFECTS ON JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING, INDEPENDENCE, AND POWER. AS SUCH, IT HAS CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERBRANCH RELATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. EFFECTIVELY MEASURING COMPLIANCE WITH JUDICIAL RULINGS AND CLEARLY EXPLAINING WHEN AND WHY ELECTED LEADERS ADHERE TO COURTS' MANDATES PRESENT A RANGE OF INFERENTIAL CHALLENGES. BUILDING ON THE GROUNDWORK LAID IN THE BURGEONING LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC, THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES TWO ANALYTIC FRAMEWORKS (ONE FOR MEASURING AND ONE FOR EXPLAINING COMPLIANCE), OFFERS STRATEGIES FOR GRAPPLING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF DESCRIPTIVE AND CAUSAL INFERENCE THAT ARISE IN STUDYING COMPLIANCE, AND ADVOCATES THE USE OF MULTIPLE ANALYTIC METHODS TO GENERATE AND TEST HYPOTHESES REGARDING COMPLIANCE.
529	THE IDEA OF IMMUNITY FROM LEGAL PROCESS IS, AS A GENERAL RULE, ABHORRENT TO MODERN LEGAL CIVILIZATION. THE ORIGIN OF THIS CLASS OF IMMUNITY TRACES BACK TO THE ERA OF ABSOLUTE MONARCHS, WHEN IT WAS BELIEVED THAT A KING COULD DO NO WRONG, THUS THE TERM SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY, OF WHICH THE EXPRESSION 'EXECUTIVE IMMUNITY' IS A DERIVATIVE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES, ALBEIT BRIEFLY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION CONFERRED ON CERTAIN POLITICAL OFFICE HOLDERS IN NIGERIA. THE ORDER OF PROGRESSION OF THIS PAPER SHALL BE AN EXAMINATION OF THE CONCEPT OF IMMUNITY FOLLOWED BY ITS USES AND ABUSES IN NIGERIA, SOME ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST ITS RETENTION IN THE CONSTITUTION, COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE POSITION IN A FEW OTHER COUNTRIES, A BRIEF CONSIDERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND FINALLY SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION.
530	DEMOCRATIZING EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS WITHIN THE UNSTABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS OF POST-COMMUNIST SETTINGS BECAME AN ISSUE OF STABILITY IN THE REGION. RECENT EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN UKRAINE SENT A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD ABOUT PEOPLE'S WILL FOR A FUTURE COMMITTED TO FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT UKRAINIANS WANT CHANGE FOR DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. HOWEVER, UKRAINE'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, INHERITED FROM THE SOVIET ERA, REMAINS PREDOMINANTLY AUTHORITARIAN DESPITE CENTRALIZED EDUCATIONAL REFORMS. DISCUSSING THE CHALLENGES OF PEDAGOGICAL RE-CONCEPTUALIZATION REFLECTED IN THE INTERVIEWS OF TEACHER EDUCATORS, THE AUTHORS DEFINE SEVEN MAJOR STEREOTYPES OF EDUCATING PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS AND SUGGEST RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL CHANGE THAT WOULD PROMOTE THE BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY IN THIS POST-CONFLICT SOCIETY.
531	THIS STUDY IS DEVOTED TO ANALYZE THE PROPOSALS FOR THE MODIFICATION OF THE VENEZUELAN 1999 CONSTITUTIONS FORMULATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THAT COUNTRY BEFORE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON AUGUST 2007, BY MEAN OF WITCH SEEK TO INTRODUCE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE CONCEPTION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE STATE, IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE CURRENT MODEL OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL STATE, BASED ON A SYSTEM OF MIXED ECONOMY WHICH COMBINE ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND STATE INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND TRANSFORM IT INTO A SOCIALIST, CENTRALIZED AND MILITARY STATE, BASED ON THE EXTINCTION OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND PROPERTY RIGHTS AS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, ESTABLISHING A CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM BASED ON THE STATE EXCLUSIVE ROLE IN THE ECONOMY THROUGH A CENTRALIZED PLANNING SYSTEM. SUCH "REFORM" COULD ONLY BE MADE THROUGH A CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.
532	THE CRIME OF IMPROPER BRIBERY OR BRIBERY IN CONSIDERATION OF OFFICE PUNISHES THE OFFICIAL WHO RECEIVES AN ADVANTAGE AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO GIVES THE ADVANTAGE SIMPLY FOR THE OFFICE HE OR SHE HOLDS. THE LACK OF ADEQUACY OF THIS CRIMINAL OFFENCE TO THE CONCEPT OF CORRUPTION, AS WELL AS ITS LOW LEVEL OF HARM WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGAL RIGHT AND THE TOTAL LACK OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE OTHER BRIBERY OFFENCES, MAKE IT A CRIME OF DUBIOUS CRIMINAL LAW LEGITIMACY. BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THIS ESSAY PROVIDES CRITERIA FOR A LIMITED APPLICATION OF THE OFFENCE AND ALSO ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF ITS DECRIMINALISATION IN ORDER TO APPLY THE BASIC PARAMETERS OF A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW.
533	IN LIGHT OF A GROWING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP THAT HAS CAST DOUBT ON THE ANALYTIC IMPORT OF SPONTANEOUS ORDER, THE PURPOSE OF MY ARTICLE IS TO RETHINK THE INTELLECTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EDMUND BURKE AND FRIEDRICH HAYEK BY SUGGESTING THAT READING SPONTANEOUS ORDER INTO BURKE'S THOUGHT INTRODUCES GREATER TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO THINKERS THAN PRIOR SCHOLARS HAVE SUGGESTED. ONE CRUCIAL TENSION, I SUGGEST, IS THAT HAYEK BELIEVED THAT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, COMPETITIVE MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW COULD SUSTAIN THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL ORDER, WHILE BURKE MAINTAINED THAT PARTICULAR SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES SHOULD REMAIN PROTECTED FROM THE FULL POWER OF VOLUNTARY CONTRACTS AND EXCHANGE RELATIONS. I CONCLUDE BY SUGGESTING THAT THE TENSIONS BETWEEN HAYEK AND BURKE COULD SERVE AS COMPLEMENTARY INSTRUMENTS, RATHER THAN AS FOES, IN STRENGTHENING THE LIBERAL PROJECT IN MODERNITY.
534	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ON INCOME INEQUALITY IN EU COUNTRIES BY EMPLOYING ECONOMETRIC MODELS. WE ESTIMATED THE EFFECT OF GROWTH ON THE SHARE OF INCOME FOR ALL PARTICULAR DECILES OF POPULATION AND ON THE GINI. OTHER CONTROL VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED IN THE MODELS AS WELL. THE RESULTS SHOWED A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ON INEQUALITY, WHILE THIS IMPACT IS THE LARGEST FOR THE DECILES RANGING FROM THE THIRD TO THE SEVENTH. THIS CAN BE PERCEIVED AS AN INDICATION OF A SHRINKING MIDDLE CLASS. INEQUALITY-INCREASING EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT, OPENNESS AND PARTLY FOR INDICATORS OF IMPORTANCE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. FACTORS REDUCING INEQUALITY WERE RULE OF LAW AND POPULATION WITH TERTIARY EDUCATION. THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT TURNED OUT TO BE A RATHER INSIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT.
535	AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES FACE A DILEMMA IN PUNISHING DISSIDENTS. THEY NEED EXTRALEGAL PUNISHMENTS TO ENSURE SOCIAL STABILITY, BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO LEGALIZE PUNISHMENT DECISIONS TO SUSTAIN AN IMAGE OF ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THESE CONTRADICTORY GOALS PRESENT AN AGENCY PROBLEM: LOCAL OFFICIALS MUST SELECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE COMPETING GOALS OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. BY ANALYZING DATA ON 1408 DISSIDENTS IN CHINA FROM 2007 TO 2014, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SELECT LEGITIMATE PUNISHMENTS WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE STRONGER PRESSURE FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR PROVINCE HAS A WEALTHIER LOCAL ECONOMY. THESE FINDINGS REVEAL THE EFFECTS OF THE PRINCIPAL-AGENT PROBLEM ON THE DYNAMICS OF STABILITY PRESERVATION IN CHINA AND INDICATE THAT PUNISHMENT DECISIONS SERVE NOT ONLY THE NEEDS OF REGIME SURVIVAL BUT ALSO THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL OFFICIALS.
536	THE CULTURAL IMPORTANCE OF RELIGION AND ITS AMBIGUOUS POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE STABILITY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW RECOMMEND INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT RELIGIONS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL CURRICULA. IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS, THERE ARE EVEN GOOD SECULAR REASONS TO HAVE THIS DONE BY TEACHERS APPROVED BY THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS OF PUPILS, AS IS BEING PRACTICED IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN STATES (WITH A POSSIBILITY OF OPTING OUT, WITH ETHICS AS A SUBSTITUTE SUBJECT IN SOME SCHOOLS). IS THIS PRACTICE COMPATIBLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS NEUTRALITY OF STATES? AN ILLUSTRATIVE ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW SUITABLE CRITERIA FOR THE ADMISSION OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO OFFERING RELIGIOUS EDUCATION CAN BLOCK THE OBJECTION OF UNDUE PREFERENCE. LIKE ANY SOLUTION IN THIS FIELD, IT IS NOT IMMUNE TO THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS.
537	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POWERS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO RESOLVE COMPETENCY AND ELECTORAL DISPUTES. THE LEADING METHOD IN THIS STUDY IS THE SYSTEM ANALYSIS, WHICH ALLOWS A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM OF MEASURES AND PROCEDURES AIMED AT IMPLEMENTING THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION FUNCTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE BODY OF SERBIA. ANALYZING THE EVOLUTION OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE PRACTICE OF SERBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED THAT THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL LEGISLATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA PROVIDED THE JUDICIAL CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL BODY WITH SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE CAPABILITIES TO RESOLVE A WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL DISPUTES TO PROTECT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONALITY, LEGITIMACY, AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, AS WELL AS RIGHTS TO REGIONAL AUTONOMY AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE.
538	THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE END OF THE FORMAL DIVISION OF THE WORLD BETWEEN A COLONIZING METROPOLIS AND A COLONIZED PERIPHERY REQUIRES A DIFFERENT READING OF THE STATE'S HISTORY. THE ESSAY DEALS WITH THE RELATION BETWEEN THE FORMATION OF BRITISH INDIA AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDIAN NATIONALIST MOVEMENT THROUGH THE EVENTS RELATED TO THE 'TIGER OF MYSORE', TIPU SULTAN, AND THE SWADESHI MOVEMENT AS PORTRAYED IN TAGORE'S THE HOME AND THE WORLD. THE ESSAY SHOWS HOW COLONIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM DEVELOPED THROUGH THE CONTEMPORARY AFFIRMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE COLONIAL DIFFERENCE. THE POSTCOLONIAL STATE EMERGED VIA CONCRETE CROSSING OF THIS DIFFERENCE, WHICH TODAY ALLOWS A DIFFERENT READING OF THE POLITICAL DISCOURSES BEYOND THE AFFIRMATION OF THE STATE AS THE BARYCENTER OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AT A GLOBAL SCALE.
539	FEW CONCEPTS IN THE WORK OF WALTER BENJAMIN HAVE INSPIRED MORE THEORETICAL REFLECTIONS AND FEWER CONCRETE EXAMPLES THAN HIS NOTION OF "THE DIALECTICAL IMAGE." AS A PARTIAL CORRECTIVE, THIS ESSAY ATTEMPTS TO ANCHOR THE DIALECTICAL IMAGE-ALONG WITH SEVERAL RELATED TERMS, NOTABLY "DIALECTICS AT A STANDSTILL," "TEMPORAL DIFFERENTIAL," "HISTORICAL INDEX," AND THE "NOW OF RECOGNIZABILITY"-IN A COMMUNICATIVE PRACTICE CHARACTERISTIC OF ORDINARY CIVIC LIFE: THE INTRODUCTION SEQUENCE. MORE THAN A SIMPLE RHETORICAL ACT, ALLOWING LOCAL SPEAKERS TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO ASSEMBLED AUDIENCES, THE INTRODUCTION SEQUENCE IS A COMPLEX SOCIOPOLITICAL EVENT IN WHICH SPEAKERS DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO NEIGHBORS AND CITIZENS-EMBODIED SOCIAL BEINGS BOUND BY WEBS OF PERSONAL ASSOCIATION AND DISEMBODIED POLITICAL ACTORS EMPOWERED BY THE RULE OF LAW. UNDERITANDING THIS CONSTELLATION OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENCY IS THE BASIC TASK OF THIS ARTICLE.
540	ALBANIA'S APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP TO THE EUROPEAN UNION IN APRIL 2009 WAS A MAJOR LANDMARK FOR A COUNTRY THAT LESS THAN 20 YEARS AGO HAD EMERGED FROM COMMUNIST RULE AS THE POOREST, MOST ISOLATED, AND MOST REPRESSIVE STATE IN EUROPE. ALBANIA HAS MADE INTEGRATION INTO EU STRUCTURES THE PINNACLE OF ITS TRANSITION PROCESS. WHILE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS THIS GOAL HAS BEEN MADE ON MANY FRONTS, TREMENDOUS ROADBLOCKS STILL LIE AHEAD ON ITS ROAD TO EU ACCESSION. ALBANIA MUST ACCELERATE THE MOMENTUM FOR DEEPER POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORM, AND MUST RENEW ITS COMMITMENT TO PROFOUND RESTRUCTURING AND CHANGE. THE MOST CRUCIAL AREAS WILL BE STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND ENSURING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, RESPECTING AND ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW, AND FIGHTING AGAINST THE PHENOMENA OF CLIENTELISM, CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY.
541	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE ROLE OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND INFORMAL NETWORKS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. THE EXISTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE LITERATURE HAS MOSTLY EXAMINED THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE EFFECT OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. OUR CONTRIBUTION IS TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF INFORMAL 'SMALL WORLD' CHARACTERISTICS OF OWNERSHIP AND BOARD NETWORKS. WE USE THE CASE OF SCANDINAVIA (DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN) TO EXAMINE THESE EFFECTS. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL LARGE DIFFERENCES IN FORMAL BOARD AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES BETWEEN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES, BUT STRONG SIMILARITIES IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AS WELL AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE FIND THAT ALL THREE COUNTRIES CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS 'SMALL WORLDS' IN WHICH TRUST, INFORMATION DIFFUSION AND REPUTATION MECHANISMS ARE ACTIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS.
542	ON DECEMBER 25, 1951, APPROXIMATELY FIFTY LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT (LAPD) OFFICERS BRUTALLY BEAT SEVEN YOUNG MEN IN THEIR CUSTODY, INCLUDING FIVE MEXICAN AMERICANS. THE ENSUING CONTROVERSY BECAME KNOWN AS BLOODY CHRISTMAS. MEXICAN AMERICAN ACTIVISTS DEMANDED INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND LAPD ACCOUNTABILITY TO CIVILIAN CONTROL. THE LAPD'S NEW CHIEF, WILLIAM PARKER, HOWEVER, HAD JUST LAUNCHED A REFORM CAMPAIGN BASED ON THE POLICE PROFESSIONALISM MODEL, WHICH STRESSED POLICE AUTONOMY, PARTICULARLY ABOUT INTERNAL DISCIPLINE. PARKER AND HIS ALLIES IN CITY GOVERNMENT STIFLED EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO DEPARTMENT MATTERS, VILIFIED LAPD CRITICS, AND EVEN IGNORED PERJURY BY OFFICERS. THEY THUS HELPED CREATE AN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE THAT VALUED LAPD INDEPENDENCE ABOVE THE RULE OF LAW AND LED TO THE LAPD'S ESTRANGEMENT FROM MEXICAN AMERICAN AND OTHER MINORITY COMMUNITIES.
543	THE HONG KONG STATUTE CRIMINALIZING DISRESPECT OF THE CHINESE NATIONAL ANTHEM, PASSED IN 2020, IS ONE OF MANY RECENT MOVES TO SUPPRESS POLITICAL DISSENT IN THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY. THE LAW RESTRICTS FREEDOM OF POLITICAL EXPRESSION, BUT ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY IS PRACTICALLY ASSURED COURTESY OF EARLIER DECISIONS UPHOLDING LAWS AGAINST FLAG DESECRATION. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON SOCIOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL LITERATURE TO ARGUE THAT SYMBOLIC NATIONALISM, PARTICULARLY WHEN GIVEN THE FORCE OF LAW, IS A TOOL OF THE AUTHORITARIAN STATE. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, IT CRITICALLY AND COMPARATIVELY ANALYSES HONG KONG JUDICIAL DECISIONS UPHOLDING THE SUPPRESSION OF SYMBOLIC DISSENT, ASSESSING THEIR DOCTRINAL COHERENCE, NORMATIVE DEFENSIBILITY, AND CONSEQUENCES. IT CONCLUDES WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THE EFFICACY OF ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE PATRIOTIC ORTHODOXY AND ON HOW DEFERENCE TO AUTHORITARIANISM AFFECTS THE RULE OF LAW.
544	GLOBALIZATION IS ORIGINALLY AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON WITH STRONG SOCIAL AND LEGAL IMPACTS. IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND LEGAL LITERATURE WITH EMPHASIS ON BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL AND PUBLIC LAW POINTS TO THE NEOLIBERAL CHARACTER OF GLOBALIZATION, VIOLATING THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS AND MATERIAL EQUALITY, AND AGAINST NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. THIS ARTICLE AGREES WITH THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF GLOBALIZATION, BUT POINTS OUT THAT THIS VIEW IS PARTIALLY INSUFFICIENT IN THE FIELD OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW FOR TWO MAIN REASONS: A) DISREGARDS THE IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION ON THE FIELD OF COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND B) CRITICIZES LIBERALISM IN AN EXACERBATED MANNER, WHICH IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM. THUS, THE WORK REFLECTS ON COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND ITS CONSTRUCTION FROM GLOBALIZATION, DEVELOPING THE THEME OF CRITICISM OF CONTEMPORARY AND LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM.
545	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INTERPERSONAL TRUST (AS INFORMAL RULES AND BEHAVIOR) AND TRUST IN BANKS (AS FORMAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS) AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL SOURCES OF TRUST. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS WERE APPLIED TO DATA FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY EXTRACTED FROM THE WAVE 6 (2010-2014). THE RESULTS OF CROSS-SECTIONAL ESTIMATIONS SHOW COMPLEMENTARY VIEW ON INTERACTION - A POSITIVE LINK BETWEEN INTERPERSONAL TRUST AND TRUST IN BANKS. USING CLUSTER METHOD, STRONG IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT (GDP PER CAPITA, EDUCATION INDEX, INEQUALITY INDEX, RULE OF LAW INDEX) ON THE LEVEL OF INTERACTION HAS BEEN FOUND. THE LOWEST LEVEL OF LINKAGES BETWEEN INTERPERSONAL TRUST AND TRUST IN BANKS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORST INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF IMPACT - WITH THE BEST INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT.
546	WHEN XI JINPING BECAME GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) IN 2012 HE FACED THE MAJOR TASKS OF FIGHTING CORRUPTION, GETTING BEYOND THE STYMIED COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP OF HU YAOBANG, STRUCTURAL REFORM OF THE ECONOMY, AND PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. IN HIS FIRST TERM XI HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ALL THESE AREAS THROUGH HIS PRESIDENTIAL STYLE OF LEADERSHIP, THOUGH NOT WITHOUT PROBLEMS. THE KEY TASK OF HIS LIKELY SECOND TERM (THE 19TH CENTRAL COMMITTEE (CC), 2017-2022) WILL BE TO ESTABLISH A "NEW NORMAL" OF LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND HABITS THAT WILL PROVIDE POLITICAL CONTINUITY FOR A MODERATELY PROSPEROUS CHINA AND A CPC ENTERING ITS SECOND CENTURY. THE CHANGES ARE FORESHADOWED IN THE DOCUMENTS OF THE SIXTH PLENUM OF THE 18TH CC RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2016.
547	BASED ON A SHORT RECAPITULATION OF SCHUCKING'S FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FORMATIVE YEARS AS A LAW STUDENT AND YOUNG SCHOLAR, THE ARTICLE THEN FOCUSES ON SCHUCKING AS A LEFT-LIBERAL POLITICIAN AND - STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY KANT'S TRACT ON PERPETUAL PEACE - AS AN ADHERENT TO A PROGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER BASED ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WORLD AND THE RULE OF LAW. SCHUCKING PARTICIPATED IN THE VERSAILLES PEACE CONFERENCE AND IN THIS CAPACITY SUPPORTED THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS PROJECT. HOWEVER, HE BECAME INCREASINGLY CRITICAL WITH REGARD TO THE VERSAILLES PEACE TREATY WHICH HE HELD TO BE SHORTSIGHTED AND PRONE TO LEAD TO ANOTHER WORLD WAR. HE WITHDREW FROM HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND CONCENTRATED ON DEVELOPING HIS CONCEPT OF AN INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A DYNAMIC TOOL TO INDUCE THE NECESSARY PROCESS OF PEACEFUL CHANGE.
548	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EU-LEVEL FACTORS IN THE EUROPEANIZATION OF POLITICAL ELITE DISCOURSES ON THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL CRITERIA BY EVALUATING ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS OF NATIONAL CONTEXTUAL, PARTY-LEVEL, AND INTRAPARTY-LEVEL FACTORS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE HELSINKI SUMMIT DECISION IN DECEMBER 1999 TO RECOGNIZE TURKEY AS A CANDIDATE HELPED PLACE THE ISSUES OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND RULE OF LAW IN THE DISCOURSES OF TURKISH POLITICAL ELITES MORE DECISIVELY. HOWEVER, IT ALSO ARGUES THAT NATIONAL CONTEXT, PARTY-LEVEL, AND INTRAPARTY-LEVEL FACTORS PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE PROVIDING A FAVORABLE AND RECEPTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE EU'S POLITICAL CRITERIA FOR MEMBERSHIP TO BECOME A CENTRAL CONCERN FOR POLITICAL ELITES IN TURKEY BY CREATING AN ELITE CONSENSUS ON DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING THE HELSINKI SUMMIT.
549	OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO, GROWING ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO NOTIONS OF PREVENTIVE WAR. THE MOST NOTORIOUS CASE IS THE APPROACH ADOPTED BY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS, BUT THERE HAS BEEN A MUCH WIDER DEBATE. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE LINEAMENTS OF THAT DEBATE, AND THE ADVOCACY OF A LEGITIMATE DOCTRINE OF PREVENTIVE WAR, BY THOSE WHO ARE NORMALLY SEEN-RIGHTLY-AS DEFENDERS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE JUST WAR TRADITION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY SOME NOTIONS OF PREVENTIVE WAR ARE PROFOUNDLY PROBLEMATIC AND THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEM FIT WITHIN THE RUBRIC OF THE JUST WAR TRADITION IS DOOMED TO FAILURE AND POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING FOR THE COHERENCE OF THE TRADITION AS AN APPROACH TO THE RESTRAINT OF WAR.
550	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW'S INABILITY TO DEAL WITH RELIGION IN A SATISFYING WAY FLOWS, IN PART, FROM ITS FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND RELIGION AS, IN A ROBUST SENSE, CULTURE. ONCE ONE BEGINS TO UNDERSTAND THE CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW ITSELF AS A CULTURAL FORM, IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT LAW RENDERS RELIGION IN A VERY PARTICULAR FASHION, AND THAT THIS RENDERING IS A PRODUCT OF LAW'S SYMBOLIC CATEGORIES AND INTERPRETIVE HORIZONS. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS OUT THE ELEMENTS OF CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM'S UNIQUE RENDERING OF RELIGION AND ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM CLAIMS TO UNDERSTAND RELIGION AS A CULTURE, THIS IS TRUE ONLY IN THE THINNEST OF SENSES. MORE ACCURATE (AND MORE ILLUMINATING) IS THE CLAIM THAT LAW'S VIEW OF RELIGION IS, ITSELF, PROFOUNDLY CULTURAL.
551	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE NATURE AND DYNAMICS OF THE NEW PEACE PROCESS STARTED BETWEEN THE TERRORIST GROUP ETA AND THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HEADED BY PRESIDENT RODRIGUEZ ZAPATERO. A NEW ATTEMPT TO STOP ETA'S ACTIVITIES, CHARACTERISED BY A "LACK OF DEFINITION", TRIES TO MAKE COMPATIBLE TWO ESSENTIALLY CONFRONTED APPROACHES: A VISION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM, AND A VISION OF THE PROCESS AS A CONFLICT RESOLUTION SITUATION. TO UNDERTAKE A PEACE PROCESS WITH ETA ON THE BASIS OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION, TRYING AT THE SAME TIME TO KEEP AN ANTITERRORIST POLICY, IS CONCEPTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE. FURTHERMORE, THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S INABILITY TO ACCEPT ALL THE IMPLICATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES OF A PEACE PROCESS DEVELOPED UNDER CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES AND PROCEDURES RESPECTING THE PRESENT SPANISH RULE OF LAW-MAKES THIS STRATEGY NON-VIABLE.
552	THE PARAMETERS OF POWER POLITICS HAVE CHANGED IN EUROPE AND THE EU EXPORTS THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS WORLDWIDE. THE CRITERIA FOR JUDGING THE POLITY'S NORMATIVE QUALITY MAY BE DERIVED FROM COSMOPOLITANISM, I.E. WHETHER IT SUBJECTS ITS ACTIONS TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF A HIGHER RANKING LAW. THE AUTHOR ESTABLISHES THIS CRITERIA, ITS THEORETICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL UNDERPINNINGS, AND PROVISIONALLY ASSESSES WHETHER THE EU IN FACT COMPLIES WITH IT. WE MAY QUESTION WHETHER THE EU'S EXTERNAL FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY IS ACTUALLY CONSISTENT WITH COSMOPOLITAN TENETS BUT WE NEED AN APPROACH THAT DOES NOT RULE THIS OUT AS A LOGICAL POSSIBILITY. WE THUS NEED A THEORETICAL APPROACH THAT DOES NOT PREDETERMINE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT ORDER IS POSSIBLE AS DO REALISM AS WELL AS IDEALISM.
553	WHAT MOST CHARACTERIZES GERMAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SINCE THE 18TH CENTURY IS ITS EARLY MODERNIZATION RELATIVE TO THE POLITICAL REGIME. THE ''RULE OF LAW'' BECAME THE CENTRAL MECHANISM OF MODERNIZATION WHEN THE ''RULE OF MAN''-THE NONCONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY-WAS STILL INTACT. THE ''SCIENCE'' OF ADMINISTRATION WAS, UNTIL RECENTLY, DOMINATED BY JURISPRUDENCE, AS WERE THE INSTITUTIONS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. A SOCIAL SCIENCE-ORIENTED CONCEPT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE ONLY EMERGED WITH THE REFORMIST DRIVE FOR ACCELERATED MODERNIZATION OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC PLANNING IN THE 1960S. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE FROM THE 1960S TO THE 1990S AND ARGUES THAT TODAY, AS IN THE PAST, REFORM REMAINS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF GERMAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY WITH ITS CURRENT EMPHASIS UPON THE PROBLEMS OF GERMAN REUNIFICATION.
554	TO SECURE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM BY GRANTING EQUAL RIGHTS IS A CENTRAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. A GAP DOES, HOWEVER, REMAIN BETWEEN THE EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND THE INEQUALITY OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES. SOVIET LAWYER EVGENY B. PASHUKANIS FORMULATED IN 1924 THAT IT IS THE LAW WHICH, THROUGH THE ABSTRACTNESS OF ITS LANGUAGE AND INSTITUTIONS, ALLOWS THOSE RICH IN POWER AND POSSESSION TO DISGUISE THEIR MATERIAL INTERESTS. IN HIS OPINION, THE TRANSFORMATION FROM CAPITALISM TO COMMUNISM WOULD INEVITABLY REQUIRE ALL LAW TO WITHER AWAY. THE METAPHOR GIVES WAY TO A CRITICAL REFLECTION ABOUT WHERE THE LEGAL ABSTRACTIONS COME FROM AND WHAT THEY DO TO OUR EVERYDAY RELATIONS. THIS TEXT ARGUES THAT IT IS EVEN MORE AN INVITATION TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS REFLECTION CAN BE MADE ACCESSIBLE TO A GREATER PUBLIC.
555	NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING (SWB) HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO SOCIOECONOMIC, CLIMATIC, AND GENETIC FACTORS. WE FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR FACET OF SWB-HAPPINESS OR POSITIVE AFFECT-MEASURED BY THE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE WORLD VALUES SURVEY (WVS). WE FIND THAT NATIONAL PERCENTAGES OF VERY HAPPY PEOPLE ACROSS THE THREE LATEST WVS WAVES (2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014) ARE CONSISTENTLY AND HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH NATIONAL PREVALENCE OF THE RS324420 A ALLELE IN THE FAAH GENE, INVOLVED IN THE HYDROLYSIS OF ANANDAMIDE, A SUBSTANCE THAT REPORTEDLY ENHANCES SENSORY PLEASURE AND HELPS REDUCE PAIN. CLIMATIC DIFFERENCES ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN HAPPINESS, WHEREAS ECONOMIC WEALTH, RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH, RULE OF LAW, PATHOGEN PREVALENCE, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF SHORT VERSUS LONG ALLELES IN THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE SLC6A4 ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF NATIONAL HAPPINESS.
556	CHRISTIANITY IN MAINLAND CHINA HAS OFTEN BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A RELIGION FOR THE MARGINALIZED OF SOCIETY. HOWEVER, SINCE THE 1990S, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING PHENOMENON WITHIN THE COUNTRY'S BURGEONING URBAN METROPOLISES WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF URBAN INTELLECTUALS CONVERTING TO PROTESTANTISM. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE THEOLOGY OF SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THESE URBAN INTELLECTUAL CHRISTIANS WHO MAKE USE OF THE TEACHINGS OF JOHN CALVIN AND HIS FOLLOWERS. THIS ARTICLE WILL SHOW THAT THERE IS A STRONG THEOLOGICAL INTEREST IN ENGAGING IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AROUND SUBJECTS LIKE THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND A CIVIL SOCIETY. ALTHOUGH THE REPRESENTATIVES CITED IN THIS ARTICLE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS 'CHINESE NEW CALVINISTS' OR 'CHRISTIAN PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS', IT IS PROPOSED HERE THAT A MORE APPROPRIATE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GROWING AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP IS AS CHINESE PUBLIC THEOLOGIANS.
557	ETHICAL DECISIONS ARE CONTEXTUALIZED IN THE DIALECTIC OF A MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING SITUATION, SETTING, CULTURE, AND GENERATION. THERE MAY BE FURTHER GAPS BETWEEN THE ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF PROFESSIONALS AND FOLK VALUES. THE EXPERIENCE OF PROMOTING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN HONG KONG ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. WHEREAS THE RULE OF LAW UNDER A WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEM ADVOCATES HUMAN RIGHTS, THE TRADITIONAL EMPHASIS ON HARMONY AND PREFERENCE FOR BALANCING IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION UNDERLIE THE GAPS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE IDEALS. THE CASE OF THE HONG KONG SECONDARY SCHOOL PLACES ALLOCATION SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS THE CONFLICTING PERSPECTIVES OF LAW, GENDER STEREOTYPES, PSYCHOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS IN PROMOTING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND PLACEMENT. THE CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS CASE ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEX CONTEXTS OF ETHICAL DECISIONS.
558	DESPITE THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE'S DECLARATION THAT TREATIES ARE THE "LAW OF THE LAND," EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE TREATIES THAT GUARANTEE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS INTO DOMESTIC LAW HAVE BEEN STYMIED BY A WAVE OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION. CRITICS ARGUE THAT GIVING THESE TREATIES THE FORCE OF DOMESTIC LAW WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES LIKE SOVEREIGNTY, DEMOCRACY, FEDERALISM, AND SEPARATION OF POWERS. THIS NOTE ANALYZES THESE FOUR CRITIQUES AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THE VALUES CRITICS SEEK TO PROTECT ARE NOT JEOPARDIZED BY THE EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF TREATY-BASED RIGHTS OR THE DOMESTIC ENFORCEMENT OF TREATIES THAT GUARANTEE RIGHTS SPECIFIC TO ALIENS. WITH THAT DISCOVERY IN MIND, THIS NOTE PROPOSES TO INCORPORATE SUCH TREATIES INTO U.S. LAW IN A WAY THAT BOTH AFFIRMS CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
559	FOCUSING ON JUSTINE MORITZ'S TRIAL AND ITS POLITICAL AND LEGAL CONTEXTS, THIS ESSAY EXPLORES MARY SHELLEY'S USES OF GENEVA AS A RESPONSE TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S ARBITRARY, REPRESSIVE MEASURES IN 1817. CONSIDERING EVENTS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF GENEVA'S CRIMINAL OR CIVIL CODE, I SHOW HOW SHELLEY DRAWS ON BOTH OLD REGIME AND REVOLUTIONARY REPRESENTATIONS OF THE CITY-REPUBLIC IN HER NARRATIVE OF MORITZ'S AND OTHER TRIALS TO DRAMATIZE THE RESEMBLANCES BETWEEN REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE AND ARBITRARY LAW. BY HISTORICIZING THE THEME OF JUSTICE IN FRANKENSTEIN AND REPLACING IT IN ITS ORIGINAL CONTEXT, I ARGUE THAT SHELLEY'S NOVEL ENDORSES NEITHER A PATRIARCHAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT NOR RADICAL POLITICS BUT MAKES A POWERFUL CASE FOR A LEGITIMATE RULE OF LAW THAT STRICTLY UPHOLDS RATIONAL, CODIFIED PRINCIPLES.
560	TRUTH REVELATION PROCEDURES ARE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO VARIOUS NORMATIVE CRITERIA. THE AUTHORS FIND THE CONCEPTS OF FALSE CONVICTION AND FALSE ACQUITTAL MORE ADEQUATE FOR SUCH EVALUATION THAN THE CONFORMITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND APPLY A USEFUL CLASSIFICATION OF TRUTH REVELATION PROCEDURES INTO INCENTIVE-BASED (ITRS) AND EVIDENCE-BASED ONES (ETRS). ITRS INDUCE PERPETRATORS AND SECRET AGENTS OF THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME TO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT THEIR PAST, WHILE ETRS RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON PRESERVED EVIDENCE AND VICTIMS' TESTIMONIES. USING A SIMPLE DECISION-MAKING MODEL, THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT WHILE BOTH PROCEDURES ARE SENSITIVE TO THE PROBLEM OF FALSIFIED EVIDENCE, ITRS PERFORM BETTER WITH RESPECT TO REVEALING THE IDENTITY OF COLLABORATORS WHOSE FILES WERE DESTROYED. FINALLY, THEY DISCUSS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ITRS AND TWO MODES OF COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PAST, ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS.
561	THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA RULED IN 1998 THAT NEITHER THE CANADIAN CONSTITUTION NOR INTERNATIONAL LAW ALLOWS QUEBEC TO SECEDE FROM CANADA UNILATERALLY. SECESSION WOULD REQUIRE AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, YA CLEAR MAJORITY OF QUEBECERS UNAMBIGUOUSLY OPTS FOR SECESSION, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE OTHER PROVINCES WOULD HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO NEGOTIATE. THIS IS AN OBLIGATION THAT THE COURT DECLARED TO BE IMPLICIT IN FOUR PRINCIPLES THAT "INFORM AND SUSTAIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT"-FEDERALISM, DERNOCRACY, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR MINORITIES. THE SAME SET PRINCIPLES WOULD GOVERN THE NEGOTIATIONS THEMSELVES. ACCORDINGLY QUEBEC COULD NOT DICTATE THE TERMS OF SECESSION, AND ONE CANNOT ASSUME THAT AGREEMENT WOULD BE REACHED. IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL, AND QUEBEC DECLARES INDEPENDENCE UNILATERALLY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER QUEBEC'S ACTION WAS LEGITIMATE.
562	THE PAPER DEALS WITH INITIATION AND DESTINY OF THE UNIQUE 1994 PRO-GRAM OF COMBATING THE EXTREME SERBIAN HYPERINFLATION. DESPITE THE ORIGINALITY OF THE PROGRAM AND DECISIVENESS WITH WHICH THE RELATED STEPS HAD BEEN UNDER-TAKEN, THE PROGRAM LASTED NOT MUCH MORE THAN HALF A YEAR. IT TURNED OUT TO BE UNSUSTAINABLE AS IT IS COLLIDED WITH INEFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WHERE CON-TRACTS AND RULE OF LAW WERE NOT HONORED, AND EMPLOYEES, IN SELF-MANAGED FIRMS, DECIDED ON THEIR OWN REMUNERATION. WE SHOW THAT FOR LASTING STABILIZATION A FAR-REACHING INSTITUTIONAL REFORM WAS NEEDED, AND FOR IMPLEMENTING SUCH REFORM AN EQUALLY RADICAL REFORM OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WAS NECESSARY. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NOT POLITICAL WILL FOR THESE REFORMS, SINCE THEY WOULD OUST THE THEN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ELITE FROM THE POWER.
563	IN GERMANY, THERE IS NO EXHAUSTIVE INSTITUTIONALISED PROCESS OF SCRUTINY FOR PARLIAMENT TO ENSURE THE QUALITY OF LAWS. NEITHER THE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT NOR THE PARLIAMENTARY ADMINISTRATION ARE TASKED WITH THIS QUALITY REVIEW. IN FACT, THE GERMAN LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE DRAWS ON A PLURALISTIC CONCEPT OF QUALITY REVIEW: ALL ORGANS AND PERSONS INVOLVED IN LEGISLATION ARE CALLED UPON IN ORDER TO ENSURE GOOD LEGISLATIVE QUALITY. THIS CONCEPT STRESSES THE POLITICAL REALITY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, RATHER THAN THE LEGAL RATIONALITY RESULTING FROM THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEREFORE ACCEPTS INFERIOR LAWS BASED ON DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY RATHER THAN GOOD LAWS THAT IN TURN DO NOT RELY UPON THE EXPERTISE OF DEMOCRATICALLY NON-LEGITIMATED COMMITTEES. AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THESE POLES CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN TIME: AFTER ALL, LAWS ARE AMENDABLE, THUS ADAPTIVE AND IMPROVABLE.
564	THIS PAPER CRITICALLY ANALYSES THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INCREASE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF CONDUCT PREPARATORY TO AN OFFENCE DISPLAYED IN RECENT TIMES UNDER SPANISH CRIMINAL LAW. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS PHENOMENON, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TREND TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE PUNITIVE LINE OF DEFENCE, IS DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE OBJECTIVE OF PUNISHING INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THEIR DANGEROUSNESS RATHER THAN ON THE HARM CAUSED BY THEIR SPECIFIC ACTS. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE SERIOUS RISKS THAT THIS IMPLIES FOR THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING ANY DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE RATIONALE FOR AND THE LIMITS ON THE PUNISHMENT OF PREPARATORY ACTS, WHICH, IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, SHOULD APPLY ON A GENERAL BASIS TO SUCH PUNISHMENT IF THOSE RISKS ARE TO BE AVOIDED.
565	THAT ALEVIS, SUNNIS AND THE FOLLOWERS OF OTHER FAITHS AND CULTURES EQUALLY ENJOY THE FREEDOM OF LEARNING THEIR OWN FAITHS IS A PREREQUISITE TO BEING A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALEVIS AND SUNNIS, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRY'S GENERAL POPULATION, BENEFIT FROM THE MEANS OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION SUFFICIENTLY. SO, IT IS UTTERLY IMPORTANT THAT THE SUBJECT OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN ALEVIS AND SUNNIS, BE MAINTAINED AS AN ABOVE-ALL-RELIGIOUS-SECTS SUBJECT WHICH TREATS BASIC RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS EVERY MUSLIM INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE CURRICULUM AND THE BOOKS FOR THE SUBJECT OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ARE TREATED IN TERMS OF THEIR CONTENTS RELATED TO ALEVISM AND SOME RELEVANT SUGGESTIONS ARE MADE.
566	IN THE MIDST OF THE WAR ON TERROR AND UNILATERAL US SECURITY POLITICS, MANY OBSERVERS LOOK TO EUROPE FOR ALTERNATIVES. IT IS ARGUED THAT EUROPE IS PARTICULARLY OPPOSED TO PREEMPTIVE SECURITY PRACTICE, AND PREFERS INSTEAD TO RELY ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MEANING OF PREEMPTION IN THE WAR ON TERROR, AND ANALYSES THREE ASPECTS OF EUROPEAN COUNTER-TERROR POLICY. IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT, WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF POLICIES THAT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN PREEMPTIVE SECURITY PRACTICE, INCLUDING CRIMINALIZING TERRORIST SUPPORT, DATA RETENTION, AND ASSET FREEZING, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORLD LEADER RATHER THAN RELUCTANT FOLLOWER. INSTEAD OF RELYING ON IMAGES THAT POSITION EUROPE AS INHERENTLY CRITICAL OF PREEMPTIVE SECURITY, DEBATE CONCERNING THE LEGITIMACY AND DESIRABILITY OF SUCH PRACTICES MUST BE ACTIVELY FOSTERED WITHIN EUROPEAN PUBLIC SPACE.
567	THIS PAPER TAKES AS ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE A TYPICAL ARGUMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY -LEGAL NORMS OF A REASONABLY JUST STATE ARE MORALLY OBLIGATORY BECAUSE THEY PLAY AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN THE REALIZATION OF ITS CITIZENS' FREEDOM. IN CONTRAST WITH THE MOST ORTHODOX VERSION OF THIS ARGUMENT, BASED ON THE IDEA OF "GOVERNMENT BY CONSENT", THE AUTHOR DEVELOPS THE "MODEL OF NATURAL DUTY", THAT PRESUPPOSES AN OBJECTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND WHERE THE COMMON BASIS OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION IS THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEGRITY OF JUSTICE. FURTHERMORE, THIS MODEL CORRESPONDS WITH AN INTERPRETATIVE CONCEPTION OF LAW WHOSE PRINCIPAL THESIS REFUTES LEGAL POSITIVISM IN AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT: THE IDENTIFICATION OF LEGAL NORMS DOES NOT ONLY DEPEND UPON SOCIAL CONVENTIONS, BUT ALSO ON THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR NORMATIVE FORCE.
568	IN THE FINAL DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AN IMPORTANT TYPE OF MUSLIM LEADER-INTELLECTUAL BECAME PROMINENT, PLAYING SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MUSLIM RECONCEPTUALISATIONS OF RELIGION AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT MUSLIM ACTIVIST INTELLECTUALS LIKE ANWAR IN MALAYSIA, KHATAMI IN IRAN, AND WAHID IN INDONESIA HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ARTICULATING AND SOMETIMES IMPLEMENTING NEW CONCEPTS AND PARADIGMS IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. IN PARTICULAR, REACTING AGAINST THE 'CLAS/JIHADISTS VIEW' OF THE WORLD, THEY HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN DEFINING THE TERMS OF INTER-CIVILISATIONAL DIALOGUE FROM AN ISLAMIC PERSPECTIVE WHICH RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO THE REALITIES OF GLOBAL DIVERSITY AND MULTICULTURALISM, ISSUES OF DEMOCRATISATION CIVIL SOCIETY, THE RULE OF LAW, PLURALISM, AND TOLERANCE HAVE BECOME COMMON THEMES OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF THEIR COUNTRIES.
569	THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE UNDERPRICING OF IPOS IN HONG KONG. BESIDES, ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES PRESENTED IN THE STUDY USED QUANTILE REGRESSION AS A ROBUST TECHNIQUE TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THE UNDERPRICING LEVEL OF 986 IPO FROM JANUARY 2000 TO DECEMBER 2017 IN THE HONG KONG STOCK MARKET. THROUGH RESEARCH FINDINGS, IT IS ASSERTED THAT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND FIRM SIZE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED. WHEREAS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW ARE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED IN INFLUENCING THE UNDERPRICING OF IPO IN HONG KONG. FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE QUANTILE REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE RESEARCH IS BENEFICIAL TO THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS OF THE MARKET, SUCH AS INVESTORS, ISSUERS AND REGULATORS.
570	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE OF SUDAN TO SHOW HOW AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES BENEFIT FROM EMBRACING INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, ALLOWING THEM TO MAINTAIN DOMESTIC CONTROL AND ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT. INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION ENSURES THAT FOREIGN-INVESTMENT DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED OUTSIDE OF DOMESTIC PURVIEW, OBVIATING THE NEED FOR NONDEMOCRATIC STATES TO CREATE INDEPENDENT COURTS. RESEARCH ON JUDICIAL POLITICS IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES HAS LARGELY OVERLOOKED THOSE PRIVATE AND EXTRA-JUDICIAL PATHWAYSINTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION TRIBUNALSTHAT ILLIBERAL REGIMES HAVE BEEN TAKING. SIMILARLY, RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW HAS NEGLECTED DOMESTIC POLITICS, OVERLOOKING ARBITRATION'S CONSEQUENCES FOR DOMESTIC STAKEHOLDERS. PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION WITHOUT PAYING HEED TO ITS SIDE EFFECTS CAN UNWITTINGLY HELP ILLIBERAL REGIMES, PARTICULARLY IN WEAK STATES, TO CONTINUE TO REPRESS THEIR JUDICIARIES AND CURTAIL THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
571	RECENT MILITARY INTERVENTIONS, BOTH PEACE OPERATIONS AUTHORIZED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND ACTIONS BY INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, HAVE AIMED AT HELPING BUILD NEW OR RECONSTITUTED STATES. THE LEGITIMACY AND SUCCESS OF THESE STATE-BUILDING INTERVENTIONS ARE OFTEN CONTESTED BY LOCAL ACTORS. YET STATE-LIKE STRUCTURES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS PAPER ARGUES FOR A NEW APPROACH: TO DIRECT THE USE OF FOREIGN FORCE TOWARD ROLES THAT HELPED STATES EMERGE AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES IN HISTORICAL EUROPE, BY DEFENDING POPULATIONS FROM OUTSIDE ATTACK, PROTECTING THEM FROM BANDITRY AND VIOLENCE, AND ENFORCING PREDICTABLE RULES FOR COMMERCE AND CIVIL LIFE (WHILE TRAINING LOCAL FORCES TO ASSUME THESE DUTIES). THIS APPROACH FOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE PRACTICAL NEED TO PREPARE MILITARY FORCES FOR BOTH TRADITIONAL DEFENCE AND POLICE-LIKE ROLES.
572	THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY AGENDA UNDERTAKEN BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. WE EXPLORE HOW THE BRI - AS WELL AS AN ASSOCIATED POLICY, THE CREATION OF CHINESE OVERSEAS SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES - INFLUENCES CHINESE OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI). WE FIND THAT HOST-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FRAGILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCES CHINESE FDI VOLUMES, AND THAT THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAGILITY ON CHINESE INWARD FDI TO THE HOST IS AMPLIFIED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BRI. SPECIFICALLY, BRI POLICY FACILITATES FDI TO COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER RULE OF LAW AND LESS GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ARGUE THAT, WHILE THE BRI MAY ACTIVELY FACILITATE ECONOMIC GROWTH (I.E., VIA INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT), AND IN TURN ASPECTS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN LESS-DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, ITS LIKELY IMPACTS ON POLITICAL RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SO PROMISING.
573	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ROLE OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (IACTHR) WITHIN A BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK. A QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS OF CASES ON MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES (MNES) IDENTIFIES THE FOLLOWING: THAT THE OBLIGATIONS THE IACTHR PLACES UPON STATES EXPLICITLY CONTEMPLATE SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS; AND THAT THERE EXIST SHARED OBLIGATIONS WITH COMPANIES AND ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE MNE CONDUCT BY ESTABLISHING CONDITIONS FOR DUE DILIGENCE, SUCH AS PRIOR CONSULTATION, BENEFIT-SHARING AND REPARATION MEASURES FOR AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE, IACTHR RULINGS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN SO FAR AS THEY HAVE NORMATIVE EFFECTS ON MEMBER STATES, BUT THEY CAN ALSO PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE GIVEN THE NATURE OF CORPORATE CONDUCT AND CERTAIN NON-ENFORCEABLE RESPONSIBILITIES.
574	THIS ARTICLE DOCUMENTS TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS AS AN UNDERLYING CAUSE OF LACK OF STATE CAPACITY. THE PAPER CONTENDS THAT RUGGED TOPOGRAPHY POSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO COOPERATION AMONG THE CONSTITUENT GROUPS WITHIN THE STATE. THIS PROBLEM THEN TRANSLATES INTO INABILITY TO COMMIT TO POLICIES AND UNDER-PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS, LEADING TO SUCH OUTCOMES AS POOR PROTECTION OF RULE OF LAW, LIMITED TAX REVENUE, CIVIL VIOLENCE, AND ULTIMATELY, A WEAK STATE APPARATUS. USING SEVERAL INDICATORS CAPTURING DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF STATE CAPACITY, THE PAPER ECONOMETRICALLY TESTS ITS ARGUMENT IN A SAMPLE OF 187 INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES AND FINDS ROBUST AND CLEAR EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF ITS REASONING. FURTHER, THE PAPER DOCUMENTS THAT DELAYED URBANIZATION CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT TRANSMISSION MECHANISM FOR THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF TERRAIN RUGGEDNESS IN REDUCED STATE CAPACITY. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

575	THIS DISCUSSION CONTRIBUTES TO THE HISTORY OF THE COLONIAL RULE OF LAW THAT GOVERNED MARKET PRACTICE IN INDIA USING THE SOUTH ASIAN INDIGENOUS CREDIT INSTITUTION KNOWN AS HUNDI. A CENTURIES-OLD ARTERY OF CREDIT FOR INDIAN MERCHANT NETWORKS, AND A LIVING INSTITUTION THAT HAS LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN UNDERGROUND BY TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY LAWS, HUNDI PROVIDES A WINDOW INTO THE DYNAMICS OF COLONIAL LAW FROM THE COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL LEGISLATION OF THE 1880S TO THE FINAL ATTEMPT TO CODIFY HUNDI IN THE 1960S AND 1970S IN A BID TO BRIDGE THE GROWING DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE INDIAN INDIGENOUS BANKING SECTOR AND MODERN BANKING. I CHART THE BRITISH COLONIAL AND POST-INDEPENDENCE HISTORY OF HUNDI AS MEANS OF UNDERSTANDING THE WIDER POLITICAL, LEGISLATIVE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS OF COLONIAL STATE FORMATION AND THE LEGACIES OF LEGISLATION.
576	THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME ACKNOWLEDGES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RIGHTS. THAT NUMBER, ALBEIT INCREASING SINCE ITS INCEPTION, DOES NOT SEEM ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY. HUMAN RIGHTS TODAY ARE NOT ONLY EXERCISED IN THE TANGIBLE WORLD; THEY ARE ALSO EXERCISED ON A DAILY BASIS IN A WORLD OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING-AS SUCH THEY CAN BE EASILY BREACHED WITH A MERE CLICK OF A BUTTON. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THESE RIGHTS ARE CONTROLLED LARGELY BY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE LITTLE REGARD FOR THEIR VALUE. IN THIS PAPER WE WILL ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE THE DIFFICULTIES THE GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME FACES TODAY, THE CHALLENGE THAT IS ITS ENFORCEMENT, AND WHETHER IT HAS COME TO A STANDSTILL IN AN AGE WHERE CONNECTIONS GROW FASTER THAN THE RULE OF LAW.
577	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE DEBATE SURROUNDING JUAN LINZ'S FAMOUS DEPICTION OF THE FRANCO REGIME AS AN EXAMPLE AND POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR CONCEPTUALISING AUTHORITARIANISM AS A DISTINCT TYPE OF NONDEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REGIME. IT ANALYSES THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF SIX MAIN OBJECTIONS TO LINZ'S FRAMEWORK AND ACCOUNT: (1) THE OBJECTION TO HIS USE OF AN ABSTRACT IDEAL-TYPICAL FRAMEWORK; (2) THE OBJECTION TO HIS DEPICTION OF THE ABSENCE OF IDEOLOGY; (3) THE OBJECTION TO HIS ACCOUNT OF THE SOURCES OF APATHY AND FORMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL; (4) THE OBJECTION TO HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE FORM AND EXTENT OF THE REGIME'S LIMITED PLURALISM; (5) THE OBJECTION BASED ON THE ALLEGEDLY LEGITIMATING FUNCTION OF HIS DESCRIPTION; AND (6) THE OBJECTION TO HIS ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGIME.
578	THERE IS A LONG-ESTABLISHED CLAIM THAT EMERGENCY ACTION THROUGH THE LAW IS IMPOSSIBLE, OR BOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO CHALLENGE THIS POSITION BY REFERENCE TO THE RESPONSE OF MANY EUROPEAN STATES TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AND BY DRAWING ON LON FULLER'S THEORY OF LAW. IT ARGUES THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY A FRAGMENTATION OF GOVERNANCE BETWEEN ORDINARY, LEGAL ACTION AND EMERGENCY, EXTRA-LEGAL ACTION IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR DESIRABLE IN THIS SPECIFIC CONTEXT. IN SOCIETIES THAT ARE GENERALLY RULE OF LAW COMPLIANT GOVERNANCE ACCORDING TO FORMAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES IS NOT ONLY CONSTRAINING, IT ALSO POSSESSES THE QUALITY OF A 'LIBERATING LIMITATION', CREATING THE ROOM FOR EFFECTIVE, SUSTAINABLE ACTION. TOO LITTLE HAS BEEN MADE OF THIS POSITIVE DIMENSION OF THE LEGAL FORM AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR EMERGENCY ACTION.
579	BETWEEN NOVEMBER 3 AND 6 OF 1871, ANTONIO CANOVAS DEL CASTILLO DELIVERS A SERIES OF SPEECHES IN THE SPANISH COURTS, REFERRING TO THE SOCIALIST ASSOCIATION THE INTERNATIONAL, TO THE PARIS COMMUNE, AND MORE GENERALLY, TO THE SOCIALIST AND ANARCHIST REVOLUTIONARY RIOTS IN EUROPE, FROM 1848 ONWARDS. IN HIS WORDS, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE ARE FACED, WHICH RESULT IN A PROFOUND DEFENSE OF THE POSTULATES OF CHRISTIAN HUMANISM AND ITS INTRINSIC PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY. LIKEWISE, CANOVAS DEFINES, (INCOMPRESSIBLY FOR OUR CONTEMPORARY POINT OF VIEW) POVERTY, AS AN INEVITABLE EVIL, WHICH CAN ONLY BE ALLEVIATED THROUGH CHRISTIAN CHARITY AND DEFENDING THE HUMAN DIGNITY OF THE POOR. IN ORDER TO DEFEND THESE IDEALS, HE UNDERSTANDS AS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY, PARLIAMENTARISM AND THE RULE OF LAW.
580	THIS TEXT DEALS WITH A PHENOMENON OF TRANSFORMATION OF LAW THROUGH ONE OF ITS ESSENTIAL MODALITIES OF EXISTENCE: WRITING. LEGAL TEXTS ARE NOT ONLY WRITTEN BY LEGISLATORS OR BODIES ENTITLED TO MAKE LEGAL RULES, BUT ALSO BY JURISTS IN THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES: INTERPRETATION, PLEAD, COUNCIL, TEACHING, DECISION. THE TEXTS WRITTEN BY JURISTS ARE, FOR A PART, INTENTIONALLY DESCRIPTIVE. THEY MEAN TO BE AN INDICATION OF LEGAL RULES, ACCORDINGLY TO THE STRUCTURE OF RULE OF LAW WITHIN WHICH JURISTS DO NOT HAVE POWER TO MAKE LAW. BUT IN SPITE OF SUCH A DESCRIPTIVE INTENTION, THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS OF LAW ACCOMPLISH A TRANSFORMATION OF IT-THIS IS A CHANGE OF ITS FORM. THIS PHENOMENON OF TRANSFORMATION IS WHAT IS CALLED 'DESCRIPTURE OF LAW' IN THIS ARTICLE. IT MEANS THE CONTINUOUS REALIZATION OF LEGAL ORDER THROUGH JURISTS' WRITINGS.
581	THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE LONG-LASTING INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS USING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN CHINA AS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SETTING. BY EMPLOYING A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE STRATEGY, I FIND THAT FOR COHORTS IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, A 1-STANDARD-DEVIATION INCREASE IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ABOUT 0.1-STANDARD-DEVIATION HIGHER SAVINGS RATES NOWADAYS. OTHER POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION DO NOT FULLY EXPLAIN THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP. I ALSO FIND THAT POLITICAL VIOLENCE COULD INFLUENCE FUTURE SAVINGS THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON FACTORS INTERNAL TO THE INDIVIDUAL, BUT THAT EXTERNAL FACTORS DO NOT PLAY A ROLE. FINALLY, I IDENTIFY THAT PERSISTENCE IS LOWER IN REGIONS WITH NOWADAYS HIGHER ECONOMIC OPENNESS AND A BETTER RULE OF LAW.
582	POLICYMAKERS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH ENABLING SUSTAINABLE CORPORATE BEHAVIOR AS PART OF THE TRANSITION TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY. YET, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE QUALITY IMPACTS ON THE SUSTAINABLE BEHAVIOR OF FIRMS. DRAWING ON THE GOOD GOVERNANCE LITERATURE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE QUALITY OF DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS AT THE NATION-LEVEL AFFECTS CORPORATE SOCIAL PERFORMANCE (CSP). THIS REASONING IS TESTED USING A LONGITUDINAL DATA SET THAT COMBINES NATION-LEVEL AND FIRM-LEVEL OBSERVATIONS. DIFFERENT MODEL SPECIFICATIONS CONFIRM THAT COUNTRIES WITH A BETTER GOVERNANCE QUALITY HAVE HIGHER CSP. IN PARTICULAR, HIGHER LEVELS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CSP ACROSS MODEL SPECIFICATIONS. WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.
583	THERE IS DEMAND AMONG RUSSIA'S OLIGARCHS FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE, BUT NOT FOR THE RULE OF LAW PROPER. INSTEAD, IT IS THE DEFACTO ACCOUNTABILITY OF POLITICAL ELITES AND IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE WEST THAT THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS WANT FROM THE KREMLIN. HOWEVER, THE OLIGARCHS CURRENTLY LACK THE CAPACITY TO EFFECT CHANGE. THEIR INSUFFICIENT LEVERAGE VIS-A-VIS PUTIN IS ROOTED IN THEIR COMPETITION FOR RENTS, WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM CONFRONTING THE KREMLIN AS A UNITED FORCE. IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING THE LACK OF SYSTEMIC PRESSURE FOR CHANGE FROM THE OLIGARCHS, THIS ESSAY CONSIDERS THE PROSPECTS OF INDIVIDUAL OLIGARCHS WHO HAVE NEVERTHELESS PUSHED OPENLY FOR LIBERALIZATION OR TRIED TO EFFECT INCREMENTAL CHANGE. IT ALSO DRAWS ON COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES TO CHART THE POLITICAL BEHAVIOR OF RUSSIA'S BUSINESS ELITES IN THE FUTURE.
584	LEGAL MECHANISMS GOVERNING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AUTHORITARIAN RULE AND POST-REVOLUTIONARY TRANSITION PERIODS. EGYPT HAS EXPERIENCED THE TERROR OF A REGIME EMPOWERED BY EMERGENCY LAW. IN TUNISIA, EMERGENCY LAW WAS NOT SO MUCH AN ISSUE BEFORE BUT RATHER AFTER THE JASMINE REVOLUTION. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IN BOTH CASES, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES BRIEF PROCESS-ORIENTED ACCOUNTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TRIGGERED BY THE ARAB SPRING. IT FURTHERMORE TAKES A CRITICAL LOOK AT HOW EGYPT AND TUNISIA HAVE REDESIGNED THESE NORMS IN THE LATEST CONSTITUTIONS OF EARLY 2014. ON THE BASIS OF CRITERIA REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW AND MECHANISMS OF CRISIS GOVERNANCE IN MODERN DEMOCRACIES, THIS ARTICLE THEN ANALYSES AND EVALUATES THE KEY ELEMENTS REGARDING CHECKS AND BALANCES PERTAINING TO EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IN THE 2014 CONSTITUTIONS.
585	THIS ARTICLE COMMENTS ON THOMAS SCHULTZ'S ARGUMENT THAT, IF WE WANT TO THINK OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AS A SEPARATE LEGAL ORDER, THEN WE SHOULD SUBMIT IT TO SOME OF THE USUAL CRITERIA USED TO ASSESS THE NORMATIVE QUALITY OF A NORMATIVE SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR LON FULLER'S TAKE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS REPLY EXPLORES ADDITIONAL REFLECTIONS ON WHAT LON FULLER'S WORK COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE JURISPRUDENCE OF TRANSNATIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION, DRAWING ON FULLER'S WRITINGS ON CUSTOMARY LAW (OR 'IMPLICIT LAW' IN FULLER'S TERMINOLOGY) AND ON THE FUNCTION OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION. THE ARTICLE ENDS BY ASKING WHETHER THE LAW CREATED BY REGIMES OF TRANSNATIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS NOT OF A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT NATURE THAN THE LAW WE FIND IN STATES, AND IS THUS SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT CRITERIA OF LEGITIMACY.
586	THE DISCOURSE OF CIVIL SOCIETY HAS GONE GLOBAL. ONCE AGAIN THEORISTS OF DEMOCRACY ARE PLACING THEIR BETS ON CIVIL SOCIETY TO GENERATE SOLIDARITY, PUBLICITY, CIVICNESS, AWARENESS OF NEW FORMS OF INJUSTICE, AND DEMOCRACY VIS-A-VIS THE NEW WORLD ORDER. YET TOO MANY ANALYSTS ARE NAIVELY OPTIMISTIC OR IDEOLOGICAL ABOUT GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY'S DEMOCRATIZING ROLE. IN ORDER TO VISUALIZE THE PROPER ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT, CAREFUL SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS IS NEEDED CONCERNING THE WAYS IN WHICH GLOBALIZATION HAS TRANSFORMED THE KEY PARAMETERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND HOW SUCH CHANGES RECURSIVELY AFFECT HOW CIVIL SOCIETY IMPACTS NATIONAL, REGIONAL, TRANSNATIONAL, AND SUPRANATIONAL BODIES. THERE CAN BE NO VITAL DEMOCRACY WITHOUT CIVIL SOCIETY, BUT CIVIL SOCIETY CANNOT REPLACE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY OR THE RULE OF LAW AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT.
587	PROFESSOR ORENTLICHER ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF WHETHER AND ON WHAT BASIS A SUCCESSOR GOVERNMENT MUST PROSECUTE THE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES OF A PRIOR REGIME. CONTENDING THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT THE VERY WORST CRIMES BE PROSECUTED, SHE ARGUES THAT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, CUSTOMARY AND CONVENTIONAL, IMPOSE A DUTY TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE THE MOST SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES SERVE THE OBLIGATION TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS BEST, NOT WHEN THEY PROSECUTE EVERY PRIOR VIOLATION, NOR WHEN THEY ALLOW ALL PAST VIOLATORS TO GO UNPUNISHED, BUT WHEN THOSE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAST SYSTEM AND THE MOST NOTORIOUS HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATORS ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A SUGGESTION THAT HUMAN-RIGHTS VALUES MAY BE PROMOTED BOTH THROUGH FURTHER ELABORATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW STANDARDS AND THROUGH VIGOROUS APPLICATION OF PRESENT LAW.
588	THE SEPARATE COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RECYCLABLE WASTE MATERIALS IS THE BASIS FOR ANY RECYCLING PROCESS. THIS PRODUCES IMPORTANT ADVANTAGES, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF RESOURCE SAVINGS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE DRIVERS OF THE SEPARATE COLLECTION PROCESS OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS (I.E., ORGANIC, PAPER, GLASS, PLASTIC) AND ITS TOTAL IN THE 103 ITALIAN PROVINCES (NUTS-3), IN THE YEARS 2004-2011. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PILLARS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (SUCH AS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY), VALUE ADDED PER CAPITA AND PARTICIPATION TO ECOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR AN EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WASTE SEPARATION PROCESS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE FACTORS DO MATTER FOR AN EFFECTIVE COLLECTION OF ORGANIC WASTE, PAPER, GLASS AND PLASTIC. FURTHERMORE, THE ANALYSIS SHOWS MARKED DIFFERENCES AMONG MACRO-AREAS (NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ITALY). POLICY CONSIDERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
589	LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA'S BROADWAY BLOCKBUSTER HAMILTON: AN AMERICAN MUSICAL KEPT ALEXANDER HAMILTON ON THE $10 BILL AND HAS TRANSFORMED THIS UNLIKELY FOUNDING FATHER INTO A BROADWAY CELEBRITY. BUT WHILE HAMILTON IS CURRENTLY SEEN AS A HEROIC FIGURE, THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE NATION'S HISTORY HE WAS SEEN AS UN-AMERICANA CLOSET MONARCHIST WHO ALLEGEDLY HATED THE PEOPLE, THE GREAT BEAST. MANY PROGRESSIVE HISTORIANS AND BIOGRAPHERS REPEATED DISTORTED ACCOUNTS FIRST CIRCULATED BY THOMAS JEFFERSON AND HIS LIEUTENANTS, ALL OF WHOM WERE DETERMINED TO RUIN HAMILTON'S REPUTATION. WHILE LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA RESTORED HAMILTON TO HIS PROPER STANDING AS A KEY AMERICAN FOUNDER, HE TOO HAS MISREPRESENTED THE REAL HAMILTON. THE REAL ALEXANDER HAMILTON WAS A STATESMAN DEVOTED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO MODERATION AND POSSESSED A HEALTHY AVERSION TO UTOPIAN SCHEMES.
590	THE RULE OF LAW IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC STATE, SINCE THERE IS A REPRESENTATION THAT ALLOWS THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS THROUGH UNIVERSAL ELECTIONS, MANIFESTING THE PEOPLE'S SOVEREIGNTY; JUST AS THE PRESENCE OF VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF DEMOCRATIC STATES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE SEPARATION OF PUBLIC POWERS, WHICH IMPLIES THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIGHT DECISIONS AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT; THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER IN THE THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ( MUNICIPAL, STATE AND NATIONAL) IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IN THE POLITICAL, FINALLY, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ENSURE THE EXISTENCE OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE. HOWEVER, IN VENEZUELA A SITUATION THAT IS FAR FROM IMPLYING A DEMOCRACY AND ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT ARISES
591	THIS PAPER EVALUATES CHINA'S CORPORATIZATION DRIVE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STATE SECTOR'S CURRENT PROBLEMS. IT SHOWS THAT THE WORSENING AGENCY PROBLEM AND EXCESSIVE WELFARE BURDENS, AS WELL AS INCREASING COMPETITION, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASING LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY CHINESE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES). WHILE SOCIALIZATION OF WELFARE BURDENS MAY IMPROVE SOES' FINANCIAL HEALTH, THE MASS CORPORATIZATION DRIVE BY ITSELF WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL UNDERPINNINGS, IS UNLIKELY TO SOLVE THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL AGENCY PROBLEM. THE PAPER THEN ARGUES THAT THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RESTRUCTURING OF THE STATE SECTOR LIES IN THE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF STATE OWNERSHIP AND THE CREATION OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS, WHICH, IN TURN, REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY'S MARKET-ORIENTED INSTITUTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW. (JEL P20, P31).
592	POLAND REACTED QUICKLY AND CRUELLY TO THE GROWING NUMBER OF MIGRANTS ON ITS BORDER WITH BELARUS. THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN WARSAW SAW IN THIS AN ATTEMPT BY THE REGIME IN MINSK TO DESTABILIZE POLAND AND RESPONDED BY SEALING THE GREEN BORDER WITH BARRIERS AND DEPLOYING A MASSIVE CONTINGENT OF BORDER GUARDS AND SOLDIERS TO THE REGION. LAWS WERE ALSO TIGHTENED. POLISH AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CRITICIZED THE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHILE THE CHURCH HAS TAKEN A MEDIATING POSITION. FOR THE GOVERNMENT, THE CRISIS HAS A STRONG SECURITY POLICY DIMENSION. IT PERCEIVES AN ACT OF HYBRID WARFARE INVOLVING RUSSIA. WARSAW HAS RECEIVED FAR-REACHING SUPPORT WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. HOWEVER, THE ATTEMPT TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE CONFLICT WITH BRUSSELS OVER THE RULE OF LAW HAS NOT SUCCEEDED.
593	IT IS COMMON TO THINK THAT WHAT THEORY OF LINGUISTIC VAGUENESS IS CORRECT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR DEBATES IN PHILOSOPHY OF LAW. I DISAGREE. I ARGUE THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF PARTICULAR THEORIES OF VAGUENESS ON SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES OF LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICE ARE LESS FAR-REACHING THAN OFTEN THOUGHT. I FOCUS ON FOUR PUTATIVE IMPLICATIONS DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE CONCERNING (I) THE VALUE OF VAGUENESS IN THE LAW, (II) THE POSSIBILITY AND VALUE OF LEGAL INDETERMINACY, (III) THE POSSIBILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND (IV) STRONG DISCRETION. I CONCLUDE WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL REMARKS. DELINEATING QUESTIONS ABOUT CONVENTIONAL MEANING, LEGAL CONTENT DETERMINATION, AND NORMS OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND JUDICIAL PRACTICE CAN MOTIVATE CLEARER ANSWERS AND A MORE REFINED UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPACE OF OVERALL THEORIES OF VAGUENESS, INTERPRETATION, AND LAW.
594	THIS ARTICLE, IN A THEORETICAL ESSAY FORMAT, AIMS TO ANALYZE PRACTICES OF JUDICIALIZATION, IN NEOLIBERALISM, ESPECIALLY IN POLITICAL ECONOMY, IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE TRIAD OF POWER, LAW AND TRUTHFORMS A TRIANGLE WHOSE BASE IS BASED ON THE FUNCTIONING OF JURIDICAL SOVEREIGNTY IN CORRELATION WITH THE DISCIPLINARY POWER. INDEED, IN SOVEREIGNTY AND DISCIPLINE THERE IS A VIGILANCE OF SOCIETY AND REGULATION OF FREEDOMS AS SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE LAW FOCUSED ON DEFENSE, WHICH LEADS TO LEGAL INFLATION. IN ADDITION TO THIS DISCIPLINARY SOVEREIGNTY THERE IS ALSO A GOVERNANCE OF CONDUCT, IN NEOLIBERALISM CARRIED OUT AS A SECURITY DEVICE FOR CONTROL IN FAVOR OF ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING THE ORDER OF LAW AND ORDER, AMID THE LOGIC OF THE MARKET AND THE BUSINESS RATIONALITY OF EXISTENCES AS WELL AS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LIFE, IN BIOPOLITICS.
595	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW CHINESE NATIONAL OIL COMPANIES (NOCS) MAKE LOCATION DECISIONS REGARDING INVESTMENTS IN OVERSEAS OIL AND GAS. WE ARGUE THAT THESE LOCATION DECISIONS ARE DETERMINED BY THE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) AND HIGH-LEVEL POLITICS. AS SUCH, THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS MADE BY NOCS CHANGE OVER TIME AND ACCORDING TO WHO BEARS THE RISK OF THE INVESTMENT: THE FIRM OR THE STATE. AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS BASED ON A NOVEL DATA-SET OF CHINESE NOCS' OFDI OVER A 14-YEAR PERIOD SUPPORTS THIS ARGUMENT. OUR FINDINGS CHALLENGE EXISTING NOTIONS OF CHINESE EXCEPTIONALISM: RATHER THAN MAKING 'RISK PERVERSE' LOCATION DECISIONS, WE FIND THAT NOCS SEEK OUT HOST STATES WITH ROBUST PROVISIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OVER CORRUPTION, AND THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF STABILITY OVER THE LONG RUN.
596	AS OUR LIVES CONTINUE TO SHIFT ONLINE AND AS SMARTER NETWORK-ENABLED TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO BLUR THE LINE BETWEEN REAL AND VIRTUAL, THE THREAT TO PRIVACY IS UNMISTAKABLY REAL. WHILE THE INTERNET HAS BECOME A CONVENIENT PART OF THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF EVERYDAY LIFE, IT IS CHALLENGING NATIONAL PRIVACY REGULATION FOUNDED UPON STATE SOVEREIGNTY, BASED AS IT IS UPON PHYSICAL BORDERS. IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD, THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY HAS INDISPUTABLY BECOME ONE OF INTERNATIONAL FLAVOUR. THE QUESTION AT THE HEART OF THIS ARTICLE IS HOW DOES THE ENVIRONMENT OVER WHICH THE LAW SEEKS TO BE EFFECTIVE AFFECT THE RULE OF LAW. SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE NETWORKED DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF A SMALL SELECTION OF REGULATORY SCHEMES TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS CROSS-BORDER DATA FLOWS AND PRIVACY.
597	THIS ARTICLE IS CONCERNED WITH DEVIATIONS FROM LEGAL FUNCTIONING OF THE MODERN STATE, WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY GROUNDED ON LEGAL STRUCTURE, BUT MAY CONDUCT EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIVITIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, SPECIAL FOCUS IS DIRECTED TO CERTAIN EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THE FOLLOWING MODERN STATES: THE SUSURLUK AFFAIR IN TURKEY, THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIRS OF THE USA, GAL IN SPAIN, THE GIBRALTAR KILLINGS COMMITTED BY UK SOLDIERS, AND ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES IN ARGENTINA. THESE CASES ARE INTERPRETED FROM THE POINTS OF VIEW OF MAX WEBER'S AND JURGEN HABERMAS'S THEORIES OF THE RULE OF LAW, HANS KELSEN'S LEGAL POSITIVISM, CARL SCHMITT'S THEORIES OF THE POLITICAL AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND AUSTIN TURK'S THEORY OF POLITICAL CRIMINALITY. OUR PURPOSE, THEN, IS TO EVALUATE THESE THEORIES VIS-A -VIS THE CASES OF EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE.
598	BEGINNING IN THE 1990S, CHINA HAS COMPLETED TWO PHASES OF EMISSION TRADING PILOTS. IN THIS PAPER WE ASSESS CHINA'S PILOT PROGRAMME AND ANALYZE HOW IT HAS BEEN CONSTRAINED BY MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THREE AREAS OF GOVERNANCE CAPACITIES: STATE, POLICY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITIES. THESE PROBLEMS REFLECT DEEPER AND MORE PROFOUND DILEMMAS OF MARKET TRANSITION EXPERIENCED BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST THREE DECADES. THE DILEMMAS HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 'STATE-LED' PSEUDOMARKET, INSTEAD OF A FULL AND 'AUTONOMOUS' MARKET, FOR EMISSION TRADING IN CHINA. IT IS EVIDENTLY CLEAR THAT CHINA STILL FACES MANY CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING A MARKET FOR EMISSION TRADING WHICH REQUIRE STRENGTHENING ITS GOVERNING CAPACITY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY THE ISSUES OF THE RULE OF LAW, INDEPENDENT REGULATION, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE, AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
599	FROM THE TIME OF MACQUARIE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENT CAME LESS FROM MATERIAL SUPPORT THAN FROM THE RECOGNITION OF AN EMERGING FREE SOCIETY, DEPENDENT FOR ITS SUCCESS ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE STRENGTHENING OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, IMPROVED ADMINISTRATION, LOW TAXATION, AND AN ENVIRONMENT OF CONFIDENCE AND OPPORTUNITY THAT ENCOURAGED VOLUNTARY FLOWS OF PEOPLE AND CAPITAL FROM BRITAIN AND IRELAND. AFTER 1860, THE VALUE OF THE GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH WAS REDUCED BY THE DESTABILIZING AND GROWTH-DISTORTING CONSEQUENCES OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT, THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF COLONIAL GOVERNMENTS IN THIS LATER PERIOD WAS FOUND LESS IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO CONSTRUCT PUBLIC CAPITAL ASSETS AND MORE IN THE PROVISION OF A FAVOURABLE AND PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH PRIVATE DECISION-MAKERS WERE TO A LARGE EXTENT FREE TO PURSUE THEIR OWN PRIVATE ENDS.
600	THE AUTHORS OFFER AN ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT SLOVAK REPUBLIC ON ITS WAY TO THE EU AS WELL AS OF ITS POSITIONS IN STRATEGIC POLICY FIELDS SINCE IT BECAME AN EU MEMBER STATE IN 2004, SUCH AS MIGRATION POLICY, ENLARGEMENT POLICY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SECURITY ON THE EU'S EASTERN BORDER. SLOVAKIA'S STANCE VIS-A-VIS THE VALUES OF THE EU ARE ASSESSED BY AN ANALYSIS OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMME DECLARATIONS OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. THE AUTHORS SHOW HOW ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND GDP GROWTH HAS INFLUENCED SLOVAKIA'S SUPPORT FOR EU MEMBERSHIP, AS WELL AS HOW THE COUNTRY HAS POSITIONED ITSELF WITH REGARD TO POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL INTERESTS ON THE ONE HAND AND TO ACHIEVING EU GOALS AND POLICIES ON THE OTHER.
601	THIS ESSAY WILL CARRY OUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT DEFINE THE SOCIETY OF LATE MODERNITY, TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL CONFIGURATION DETERMINE THE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING CRIMINAL POLICY AND CRIMINAL LAW IN THE FACE OF EXCLUSION PROCESSES. WE WILL ANALYZE HOW, IN A CONTEXT OF DEEP EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE AND GROUPS, THE NECESSARY LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND CITIZENSHIP WITH RIGHTS IS BROKEN, WHICH, TO THE EXTENT THAT IS CONTRIBUTED BY THE STATE IN THE PRODUCTION OF MATERIAL CONDITIONS OF EXCLUSION, THEY WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF A STATE TO PUNISH THE EXCLUDED. TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS, WE WILL MEASURE WHAT THE CONDITIONS FOR THE CONFIGURATION OF A DECENT STATE THAT DOES NOT HUMILIATE ITS CITIZENS COULD BE.
602	GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IS A POPULAR TOPIC AMONG INTERNATIONALLY ORIENTED PUBLIC LAW SCHOLARS. DRAWING ON MODERN COMPARATIVE LAW SCHOLARSHIP, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES AND DISCUSSES GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM FROM A CRITICAL POINT OF VIEW. MANY CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS SEEM TO PRESUME THAT THE IDEA OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IS, OR THAT IT MUST BE, UNIVERSAL. ACCORDING TO SOME VIEWS, CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS NOW GONE GLOBAL. IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS THINKING, THE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS HAS ARGUABLY BECOME A DEFINING FEATURE IN A GLOBAL SCALE. IN PRACTICE, THIS MEANS THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM IS REGARDED AS RELEVANT NOT ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF STATES BUT ALSO WHEN WE ASSESS AND INTERPRET THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW BEYOND THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE INTERROGATES UNDERLYING THEMES AND CALLS THE UNIVERSALITY OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM INTO QUESTION.
603	POST-CONFLICT GOVERNMENTS AND DONORS PRIORITIZE REBUILDING THE JUSTICE SECTOR THROUGH STATE DELIVERED RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE PROGRAMMES. MISUNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE POST-COLONIAL STATE, SUCH PROGRAMMES MAKE QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. FIRST, THAT A LACK OF ACCESS TO STATE JUSTICE IS THE SAME AS AN OVERALL ABSENCE OF JUSTICE. SECOND, THAT THE STATE SYSTEM THAT IS BEING BUILT IS WHAT PEOPLE WANT. THIRD, THAT THE STATE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THAT IS BEING BUILT COULD PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE NATIONWIDE NETWORK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. BASED ON INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH POLICY DESIGNERS, PRACTITIONERS, LOCAL PEOPLE AND CHIEFS AT THREE SITES IN SOUTHERN SUDAN 2007, THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR A RETHINKING OF DONOR-SUPPORTED JUSTICE AND POLICE DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCATES AN APPROACH THAT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL JUSTICE.
604	SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF DIGNITY, CIVIL SOCIETY HAS BECOME A MAJOR STAKEHOLDER IN UKRAINE'S MULTIPLE REFORM PROCESSES. JUDICIAL REFORM HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY SALIENT AS IT AIMS TO TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY'S JUDICIARY, LONG PLAGUED BY INTERRELATED PROBLEMS OF POLITICAL DEPENDENCE, OLIGARCHIC CAPTURE, AND INTERNAL CORRUPTION, INTO AN AUTONOMOUS GUARANTOR OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW UKRAINIAN CIVIL SOCIETY HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN INFORMAL INSTITUTION IN UKRAINE'S JUDICIAL REFORM. BUILDING UPON AN OVERVIEW OF JUDICIAL REFORM EFFORTS IN UKRAINE AND A GENERAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF INFORMALITY, THIS CONTRIBUTION STUDIES HOW UKRAINIAN CIVIL SOCIETY INFLUENCES THE REFORM PROCESS, USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. WE ARGUE THAT CIVIL SOCIETY HAS BECOME AN INFLUENTIAL INFORMAL INSTITUTION WHICH PLAYS AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN JUDICIAL REFORM IN UKRAINE.
605	WITH EXAMPLES DRAWN PRIMARILY FROM THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION, THIS PAPER EXAM-INES POTENTIAL ISSUES ARISING UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW FACING ENVIRONMENTAL TREATY DEVEL-OPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR OUR NATURAL/PHYSICAL WORLD WHERE HUMAN-IMPOSED JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES, SUCH AS "HIGH SEAS," ARE SCIENTIFICALLY IRRELEVANT AND MAY EVEN BE POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO ACHIEVING THE ADMIRABLE ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES SOUGHT BY THESE TREATIES. IN THIS CONTEXT IT EXPLORES LEGAL PITFALLS PRODUCED BY WELL-MEANING BUT OFTEN INADEQUATELY ADVISED ATTEMPTS TO INCORPORATE INCOMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD SCIEN-TIFIC CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY, SUCH AS "BIODIVERSITY," IN, AND/OR IMPOSE THEM ON, ENVI-RONMENTAL TREATIES. IT CONSIDERS POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUND SCIENCE TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES WHEN IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING TREATY PROVISIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS NEGLECTED.
606	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES WAYS IN WHICH STATE CRIME THEORY, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON CONTEMPORARY CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, MIGHT BE APPLIED TO SETTLER-COLONIAL VIOLENCE AND THE FORCED DISPOSSESSION OF THE LAND FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THE AUSTRALIAN STATE WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE FOUNDATIONAL VIOLENCE INHERENT TO SETTLER COLONIALISM AND THE PROCESSES OF PRIMITIVE ACCUMULATION THAT UNDERPINNED IT. THIS CREATED THE CONDITIONS FOR ONGOING STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE, INFLICTED THROUGH A CONTINUUM OF CRIMINOGENIC, ARGUABLY GENOCIDAL STATE PRACTICES DESIGNED TO DISRUPT - IF NOT ELIMINATE - THE SOCIAL WORLDS AND COLLECTIVE IDENTITIES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THESE PRACTICES HAVE BEEN NORMALIZED THROUGH AUSTRALIAN NATIONALIST IDEOLOGY AND ITS ASSOCIATED NARRATIVES OF PROGRESS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEORIES OF STATE CRIME NEED TO BREAK FROM THESE NORMATIVE NARRATIVES TO MAKE SENSE OF THE CRIMINOGENIC NATURE OF SETTLER COLONIALISM.
607	UNDER RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE MIGRATION ACT, THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION MAY CANCEL OR REFUSE A VISA IF THEY SUSPECT THAT A PERSON BELONGS TO A GROUP, OTHER MEMBERS OF WHICH THEY SUSPECT ARE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL CONDUCT. A VISA MAY BE CANCELLED WITHOUT FIRST HEARING THE PERSON AFFECTED AND THERE IS ONLY LIMITED OPPORTUNITY FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW: CONFIDENTIAL POLICE AND INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION FORMING THE BASIS OF THE DECISION MAY BE WITHHELD FROM BOTH THE PERSON AFFECTED AND THE COURT. THE OPERATION OF THIS SET OF STATUTORY POWERS DIMINISHES THE RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIA. THIS IS DEMONSTRATED BY EXAMINING THE 2016 FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA'S DECISION IN ROACH V MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION [2016] FCA 750 IN LIGHT OF MARTIN KRYGIER'S DEFINITION OF ARBITRARY POWER.
608	THIS ESSAY OFFERS AN INTERPRETATION OF KANT'S REPUBLICANISM IN LIGHT OF THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL JUDGMENT. KANT IS SOMETIMES THOUGHT TO BASE HIS CONCEPTION OF LAW ON AN IDEA OF SOVEREIGNTY DRAWN FROM HOBBES AND ROUSSEAU, WHICH WOULD LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR POPULAR CONTESTATION OF THE STATE. IN THIS ESSAY, I RECONSTRUCT KANT'S ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW BY BRINGING OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS THEORY OF JUDGMENT. I ARGUE THAT FOR KANT THE CIVIL CONDITION IS ULTIMATELY CHARACTERIZED BY A CONTEST BETWEEN THE JUDGMENT OF THE SOVEREIGN AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE PEOPLE, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE DETERMINATIVE AND REFLECTIVE EMPLOYMENTS OF POLITICAL JUDGMENT, RESPECTIVELY. ON THIS VIEW, POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY IS ULTIMATELY LOCATED IN THE PEOPLE'S POWER TO JUDGE POLITICALLY AND CONTEST PUBLICLY THE STATE.
609	A WELL-TRAINED, PROFESSIONAL POLICE FORCE DEDICATED TO UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND TRUSTED BY THE POPULATION IS ESSENTIAL TO FIGHTING THE INSURGENCY IN AFGHANISTAN AND CREATING STABILITY. HOWEVER, THE POLICE PROGRAMMES IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE OFTEN BEEN DOMINATED BY DIFFERENT NATIONAL AGENDAS AND HAMPERED BY TOO FEW RESOURCES AND LACK OF STRATEGIC GUIDANCE. THESE ISSUES POSE AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE FOR THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN REBUILDING THE POLICE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE SHORT-TERM NEEDS OF FIGHTING AN INSURGENCY AND THE LONG-TERM NEEDS OF ESTABLISHING AN EFFECTIVE SUSTAINABLE POLICING CAPABILITY WHEN BUILDING UP THE POLICE FORCE - AND THAT THE PROCESS MUST NOT BE SUBJECT MERELY TO SATISFYING CURRENT SECURITY CHALLENGES OR TRADITIONAL STATE-BUILDING NEEDS.
610	THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM HAS BEEN AN ASTONISHING ACHIEVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) IS ONE OF THE MOST INDISPENSABLE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT EXIST TODAY. IT IS A SYSTEM BASED UPON THE RULE OF LAW, EQUIPPED WITH APPROPRIATE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO DEFUSE AND RESOLVE TRADE CONFLICTS AS IS-ELL AS PROVIDING A FORUM FOR MEMBER GOVERNMENTS TO NEGOTIATE TRADE RULES AND TRADE LIBERALIZATION. BUT, NOWADAYS, FIRE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM IS OF A CRITICAL STAGE IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS A GROWING MEMBERSHIP, A STRONGER LEGAL SYSTEM, A VASTLY, INCREASED REMIT AND A MUCH HIGHER PUBLIC PROFILE THAN ITS PREDECESSOR. GATT IT FACES THE MAJOR CHALLENGE OF CONCLUDING THE DOHA DEVELOPMENT AGENDA (DDA) ROUND OF TRADE NEGOTIATIONS. THUS THE NEED FOR REFORM OF THE WTO SEEMS OBVIOUS.
611	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CONCEPT OF STRICT SCRUTINY, THE BURDEN OF PERSUASION TEST USED BY THE COURTS TO DETERMINE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS, IT ILLUSTRATES THAT STRICT SCRUTINY HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN INCONSISTENT, ARBITRARY MANNER AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS. IT SHOWS THAT THE RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHED UNDER THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT PROVIDES AN EQUALLY IF NOT MORE COMPELLING BASIS FOR JUDGING THE LEGALITY OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS. RELYING ON THE LEGAL STANDARDS ADVANCED BY THE COURTS UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES PROVIDES MANAGERS WITH GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS. IN EFFECT, THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY OF THEIR WORKFORCES IS GREATLY ENHANCED.
612	THE POST-SOVIET SETTING IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DISHEARTENING POLITICAL PARADOX. SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, SOME KIND OF ELECTORALISM HAS BEEN SPREADING TO ALMOST EVERY CORNER OF THE FORMER EMPIRE, YET LIBERAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE NOT BEEN ITS FELLOW TRAVELERS; NOR DO THEY SEEM DESTINED TO PROVIDE COMPANIONSHIP IN THE IMMINENT FUTURE. REVISITING THE LONG-STANDING GERMAN CURRENT OF FISCAL SOCIOLOGY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO SOLVE THIS PARADOX. IN THE EUROPE OF YESTERDAY, LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM WAS THE PRODUCT OF A QUID PRO QUO BETWEEN THE RULERS AND THE RULED: AN EXCHANGE OF RIGHTS FOR REVENUE. HISTORICALLY, THIS "GRAND BARGAIN OF THE LIBERAL STATE" WAS A PREREQUISITE FOR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, AND THE VERY SAME SOCIAL MECHANISMS - OR LACK THEREOF - SEEM TO BE OPERATING IN THE POST-SOVIET WORLD OF TODAY.
613	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ORIGINAL SOCIO-POLITICAL CONCEPT OF S.I. HESSEN. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE CONTEXT OF WRITING HIS POLITICAL-LEGAL WORK, THE INFLUENCE OF METHODS AND PHILOSOPHICAL TRENDS. THE MAIN CONTENT OF THE RESEARCH IS AN ANALYSIS OF THE WORK "LEGAL STATE AND SOCIALISM", ITS STRUCTURE AND FEATURES. THE MAIN MESSAGE OF HESSEN'S WORK IS CHARACTERIZED BY A CRISIS OF LIBERALISM, WHICH WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY A CRISIS OF COMMUNISM. THE ARTICLE DEALS IN DETAIL WITH THE QUESTION OF HESSE'S ATTITUDE TO LIBERALISM AND COMMUNISM AND THE FORMATION OF ITS OWN RELATED CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LAW AS ITS INSTRUMENT. THE CONCLUSION IS MADE THAT HESSEN'S CRITICISM IS EXTREMELY FRUITFUL IN THE HISTORY OF SOCIO-POLITICAL THOUGHT.
614	AT THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE (ICJ) WAS IN ITS HONEYMOON; TODAY IT SEEMS THAT THE HONEYMOON IS OVER. WHAT COMES AFTER THE HONEYMOON? BY NOW WE HAVE LEARNED THAT ICJ CANNOT BYPASS POLITICS AND BECOME AN ORDINARY PART OF THE RULE OF LAW. BUT NORMALITY WAS NEVER A REALISTIC AIM FOR ICJ, WHICH AIMS AT THE WORLD'S MOST ABNORMAL CRIMES. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF ICJ IS A RADICAL ONE: TRANSFORMING THE WORLD'S POLITICAL IMAGINATION TO DE-SANCTIFY VIOLENCE COMMITTED IN THE NAME OF STATE OR GROUP, SO THAT IT COMES TO BE REGARDED AS MERE CRIME. BY THIS MEASURE, THE MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT OF ICJ IS POSITIVE COMPLEMENTARITY, AND THE MOST REACTIONARY IS FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF THE DOCTRINE OF STATE IMMUNITY.
615	IN THIS ARTICLE I EXPLORE SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED YOUNG MEN'S EXCESSIVE ACTS OF VIOLENCE, DRUG USE, DEATH RACE AND UNSAFE SEX AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF GEORGE BATAILLE'S ANTHROPOLOGY OF TRANSGRESSION. WHEN YOUNG MEN IN THE MOZAMBICAN CAPITAL ENGAGE IN DANGEROUS SEX OR VIOLENT RIOTS, THE FINDINGS INDICATE, IT IS LESS A SIGN OF IGNORANCE ABOUT HIV OR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW THAN AN EXPRESSION OF LIVING IN A 'STATE OF EMERGENCY' WHERE TRANSGRESSIVE DEFIANCE OF DANGER AND DEATH BECOME ATTRACTIVE. EVERYDAY TRANSGRESSIONS OF YOUNG MEN WHO CALL THEMSELVES MOLUWENE (WILD, UNRULY) ARE MOULDED IN NARRATIVES AND ACTS WHICH AT ONCE OPPOSE A SMOULDERING SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY OF EDUCATION AND A NEOLIBERAL REGIME EXILING MARGINALIZED YOUNG MEN FROM THE REALMS OF WORK AND CONSUMPTION TO PERMANENT UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY AND ORGIES OF THE MOMENT.
616	OVER THE LAST DECADE, THE UNITED STATES HAS SEEN INCREASING ANTIDEMOCRATIC RHETORIC BY POLITICAL LEADERS. YET, PRIOR WORK SUGGESTS THAT SUCH NORM-VIOLATING RHETORIC DOES NOT UNDERMINE SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AS A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. WE ARGUE THAT, WHILE THAT MAY BE TRUE, SUCH RHETORIC DOES VITIATE SUPPORT FOR SPECIFIC DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. WE TEST THIS THEORY BY EXTENDING PRIOR WORK TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF TRUMP'S NORM-VIOLATING RHETORIC ON GENERAL SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF PARTICIPATORY INCLUSIVENESS, CONTESTATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL EQUALITY. WE FIND THAT TRUMP'S RHETORIC DOES NOT ALTER ATTITUDES TOWARD DEMOCRACY AS A PREFERRED SYSTEM BUT DOES REDUCE SUPPORT FOR INCLUSIVENESS AND EQUALITY AMONG HIS SUPPORTERS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ELITE RHETORIC CAN UNDERMINE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.
617	UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING SOLDIERS COMMIT ATROCITIES WHILE DEPLOYED DESPITE THEIR MANDATE TO PROTECT CIVILIANS FROM HARM. YET, THERE IS TREMENDOUS VARIATION ACROSS MISSIONS IN REPORTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. WHY ARE SOME MISSIONS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MISCONDUCT THAN OTHERS? TO ANSWER THIS PUZZLE, WE IDENTIFY THREE BROAD SOURCES OF INFLUENCE ON PEACEKEEPER BEHAVIOR: INSTITUTIONS, SOCIETY, AND MILITARY CULTURE. USING NEWLY COLLECTED DATA, WE FIND THAT HOST-COUNTRY AND CONTRIBUTING-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS, PARTICULARLY PRESS FREEDOMS AND RULE OF LAW, DRAMATICALLY DECREASE VIOLATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW ALSO DECREASES VIOLATIONS, THOUGH TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN INSTITUTIONS. SOCIETAL INFLUENCES, SUCH AS GENDER NORMS AND INCOME INEQUALITY, HAVE VIRTUALLY NO IMPACT ON ABUSES. WE ILLUSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THESE FINDINGS BY GENERATING OUT-OF-SAMPLE PREDICTIONS FOR HYPOTHETICAL PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH RECENT POLITICAL TURMOIL.
618	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY GOVERNANCE INDICATORS THAT CAN REDUCE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN AFRICA. THEREBY, THE AUTHORS INCORPORATED GOVERNANCE INDICATORS INTO THE GROWTH MODEL. THE DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATION OF THE MODEL, BASED ON DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK, THE IMF AND UNCTAD FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2016 FOUND THAT SOME GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL STABILITY HAVE A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN AFRICA. MOREOVER, POLITICAL STABILITY DOES NOT REDUCE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IN HIGHLY CORRUPT COUNTRIES WHICH ARE RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCES. SIMILARLY, OTHER GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE NOT YET PRODUCING THE EXPECTED EFFECTS IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, POLITICAL AUTHORITIES MUST IMPROVE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, INCLUDING THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL STABILITY.
619	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT USE OF RESOURCES SHOULD MINIMIZE THE LEVEL OF HARM TO THE FUTURE USE OF RESOURCES. GOVERNANCE IS CAPABLE OF COMMON SENSE AND THE VERSATILE PLANNING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THE LITERATURE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY EXAMINED IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY AND CORRUPTION. HOWEVER, GOVERNANCE IS A VERSATILE VARIABLE THAT CONTAINS SUCH VARIABLES AS PLURALISM, ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS FROM ESTIMATES OBTAINED IN THE STUDY, GOVERNANCE HAS AN IMPORTANT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS POWERFUL EFFECT APPLIES TO ALL DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THUS, TO PREVENT RESOURCES FROM BECOMING SCARCE, COUNTRIES SHOULD INCREASE THEIR GOVERNANCE LEVELS. ACCORDINGLY, THE LEVEL OF WELFARE WILL BE PROTECTED.
620	THIS STUDY IS PRIMARILY AIMED AT TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE GROUP OF EIGHT DEVELOPING ISLAMIC COUNTRIES. USING A PANEL DATA REGRESSION MODEL, WE EXAMINED THE DATA TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL ECONOMY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHT COUNTRIES, FOR THE PERIOD 2005 TO 2014. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION CONTROL WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND STOCK MARKET TURNOVER RATE PROXY. THE EXAMINATION THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK RESULTED IN A HIGHER DETERMINATION COEFFICIENT AND LESS AVERAGE STANDARD ERROR. THIS, IN TURN, REVEALS THAT THE FITTING POWER AND EFFICIENCY OF THIS METHOD IS HIGHER THAN THE PANEL DATA REGRESSION MODEL. FURTHERMORE, THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE APPLICATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE THEORY CALLS FOR MORE INQUIRY.
621	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH ASEAN HAS ADOPTED THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. ALTHOUGH MUCH TIME HAS BEEN SPENT EXAMINING ASEAN'S MOVES TOWARDS A MORE INSTITUTIONAL, AND THUS A MORE "EUROPEAN" APPROACH, TO REGIONALISM, SUCH SIMILARITIES ARE SUPERFICIAL. IN REALITY, ASEAN REMAINS A VERY DIFFERENT FORM OF REGIONAL ENTITY TO ITS EUROPEAN COUSIN. IT IS THE SUBMISSION OF THIS PAPER THAT SUCH AN APPROACH IS INEVITABLE AS THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES DEMANDS BOTH A SUPRA-NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND NATIONAL JUDICIARIES WILLING AND ABLE TO ACCEPT ITS JURISDICTION. THE WEAK INCORPORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MAJORITY OF ASEAN STATES MEANS THAT EUROPE'S CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS ARE LIKELY TO FALL ON STONY GROUND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
622	PUBIC ADMINISTRATION, LIKE OTHER DISCIPLINES, HAS GREAT THINKERS WHOSE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE THE FOUNDATION OF ITS SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT. THEY ARE THE LEADERS AND MASTERS OF THE FIELD OF STUDY. DURING THE 18TH CENTURY, JOHANN HEINRICH VON JUSTI STUDIED THE "POLICE", PRECEDING THE FIRST STUDIES IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THAT WOULD BE PIONEERED BY LORENZ VON STEIN (GERMANY) AND CHARLES-JEAN BONNIN (FRANCE) ONE CENTURY LATER. STEIN DEVELOPED AN ADMINISTRATIVE VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE 19TH CENTURY. ON THE OTHER HAND, INSPIRED BY THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON'S EMPIRE, BONNIN CREATED THE MODERN CONCEPT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, FLORENTINO GONZA ' LEZ, A NOTABLE COLOMBIAN INTELLECTUAL, WROTE THE FIRST BOOK ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN A REPUBLIC. THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE GREAT MASTERS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
623	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF BANK PROFIT WHILE PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE INFLUENCE OF MARKET SHARE ON PROFIT, REFERRED AS THE MARKET SHARE EFFECT. THE RESEARCH SEEKS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER THE MARKET SHARE EFFECT IS CONDITIONAL UPON FOUR COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS INCLUDING CONCENTRATION RATIO, BANK REGULATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT'S GOVERNANCE AND COUNTRY WEALTH, AND IS THUS BETTER IN EXPLAINING THE MIXED RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE. THIS STUDY EMPLOYS COMPREHENSIVE DATA OF 44 COUNTRIES FROM 1998 TO 2004. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MARKET SHARE POSITIVELY INFLUENCES PROFIT WHEN NO COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, BUT FURTHER STRENGTHENED IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH CONCENTRATION RATIOS, HIGH RESTRICTIONS ON BANK ACTIVITIES IN INSURANCE AND REAL ESTATE, GOOD INVESTOR PROTECTION AND A STRONG RULE OF LAW.
624	THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL ARE UNDERSTOOD IN RUSSIA AS OPPOSITES. THIS ANTAGONISTIC IDEA IS FREQUENTLY TRACED BACK TO A BYZANTINE TRADITION. IT IS IN FACT, HOWEVER, THE LEGACY OF A SPECIFIC RECEPTION OF WESTERN THEORIES OF THE STATE AND CONCEPTS OF PERSONALITY. WITH THEIR HELP, UNLIMITED STATE POWER - WHICH CAN FORM SOCIETY (UNDERSTOOD AS TABULA RASA) IN THE NAME OF THE "PUBLIC WEAL" - IS LEGITIMISED. IN THIS WAY OF THINKING, THE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS A LEGAL ENTITY BUT ONLY AS AN EXCEPTION, AS ARTISTIC GENIUS OR ISOLATED FIGURE ON THE PERIPHERY. THIS RADICAL ANTAGONISM OF STATE AND INDIVIDUAL - WHICH IS BASED ON THE HISTORY OF IDEAS - ENCUMBERS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE FOUNDED ON RULE OF LAW THAT MAKES HUMAN RIGHTS THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS LEGITIMACY.
625	THE PERSECUTION OF CERTAIN MINORITIES DUE TO THEIR PLACE OF ORIGIN OR ETHNIC GROUP UNFORTUNATELY STILL OCCURS IN EUROPE. TO COMBAT THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BACKED A SERIES OF MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE ALL MEMBER STATES TO HAVE A COMMON FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE APPROVAL OF THE UNION'S BILL OF RIGHTS. IT IS ALSO WORTH HIGHLIGHTING THE CHALLENGES FACED BY EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS IN RELATION TO THESE ACTS AND TO THE EASE OF THEIR SPREAD VIA INTERNET, PARTICULARLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WHERE FAST AND EASY COMMUNICATION FACILITATES THE DISSEMINATION OF SUCH MESSAGES AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO FIND GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SHARE THIS IDEOLOGY, CONTRARY TO HUMAN RIGHTS, AND WHO CAN CREATE NETWORKS THAT ENDANGER THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS ONE OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES UNDERPINNING THE EUROPEAN UNION.
626	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE NEXUS BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE FOCUS IS ON 44 COUNTRIES IN SSA WITH DATA FROM 1996 TO 2016. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON TOBIT REGRESSIONS. FINDINGS IT IS APPARENT FROM THE FINDINGS THAT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE ARE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE CONSUMPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE SAMPLED COUNTRIES. THE UNEXPECTED FINDINGS ARE CLARIFIED AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE EXTANT LITERATURE BY ASSESSING HOW POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND "VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY") AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL) AFFECT THE CONSUMPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN SSA.
627	THE LEGISLATURE AND THE JUDICIARY HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FOCUS OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. HOWEVER, THE EXECUTIVE - 'THE GOVERNMENT' ITSELF - HAS BEEN COMPARATIVELY NEGLECTED. TODAY, THIS IS CHANGING WITH A WELL-SPRING OF NEW WORK THAT BEARS UPON WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE IDEAL OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE', THAT IS, HOW GOVERNMENTS (AND/OR THEIR AGENTS) SHOULD EXERCISE THEIR POWERS. THIS REVIEW PAPER BEGINS BY CLARIFYING THE CONCEPTS OF 'GOVERNANCE' AND 'GOOD' GOVERNANCE (1). IT THEN HIGHLIGHTS FIVE SETS OF VALUES, WORKING NOMINALLY FROM THE MOST FOUNDATIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE EXERCISE OF GOVERNMENT POWER TO THOSE THAT SHOULD GUIDE THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION: LEGITIMACY AND RULE OF LAW (2); RESPECT AND TRUSTWORTHINESS (3); EFFICIENCY AND RATIONALITY (4); PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY (5); AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES (6).
628	FOR MANY YEARS THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN HAS BEEN HAILED AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNTABILITY BODIES FOR UPHOLDING ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IN AUSTRALIA. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE ALMOST UNANIMOUS PRAISE FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN'S ROLE IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW FROM LEGAL CIRCLES, THERE IS A LACK OF A SYSTEMIC METHODOLOGY IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY AND SUBSTANTIATE SUCH CLAIMS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT GAP, BY FORMULATING AND APPLYING A TENTATIVE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK WHICH SEEKS TO TEST THE CLAIMS OF EFFECTIVENESS FROM LEGAL CIRCLES. IN THE PROCESS, I ARGUE IT IS BOTH PRAGMATIC AND VALUABLE TO CREATE AN EVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN. I ALSO SEEK TO SUPPORT THE CONTENTION THAT THE COMMONWEALTH OMBUDSMAN IS AN EFFECTIVE INSTITUTION FOR UPHOLDING ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE BY DRAWING UPON THE ANALYSIS DERIVED FROM THE FRAMEWORK.
629	DATA OF ALL-RUSSIAN SURVEYS CARRIED OUT IN 2013 AND 2014 BY THE INSTITUTE OF SOCIOLOGY, RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PERMITTED TO LOOK INTO NORMS AND VALUES OF RUSSIAN MIDDLE CLASS, ITS VIEWS ON THE DESIRABLE VECTOR OF COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT. VALUES THAT GUIDE MIDDLE CLASS MEMBERS IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE ARE OF MODERNIZED ACTIVIST KIND, A FACT THAT DIFFERENTIATES THEM FROM OTHER POPULATION GROUPS, WHILE POLITICAL VALUES AND ATTITUDES TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY DO PRACTICALLY NOT. AMONG MIDDLE CLASS MEMBERS (AND THE REST OF RUSSIANS), THERE IS A CONSENSUS ON THE REJECTION OF COPYING WESTERN DEVELOPMENT MODEL AND OF RUSSIA'S "SPECIAL PATH" INTO THE FUTURE. THIS IS A RESULT OF SPECIFIC NORMS AND VALUES, AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE CLASS ATTITUDE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY, RULE OF LAW ETC.
630	NOWADAYS, ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AS A RESULT OF THE WIDESPREAD USE OF FOSSIL FUELS. IN THIS SCENARIO, THERE IS A CERTAIN CONSENSUS IN THE LITERATURE THAT RENEWABLE ENERGIES ARE KEY TO STOPPING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PLANET AND TO GENERATING AN ENERGETIC AND ECOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, SOME RECENT STUDIES HAVE WARNED THAT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEITHER INNOCUOUS NOR FREE, AND THEY WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC FIELD. THIS PAPER AIMS TO REFLECT ON THE CHALLENGES AND RISKS OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES IN ORDER TO OUTLINE GUIDELINES REGARDING THEIR PRODUCTION, ADOPTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN ARGENTINA. IN THIS WAY, IT SEEKS TO RESEARCH HOW TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE REALIZATION OF ENERGY JUSTICE ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW.
631	HOW CAN WE LOCATE THE POSITION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY? RATHER THAN TRYING TO PUT A FRAMEWORK BUILT ON AN AGENT-BASED OR GLOBALIZATION CONTEXED APPROACH, THIS PAPER AIMS TO EVALUATE THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FROM A CONTEXTUAL PERSPECTIVE. WHILE DOING SO AN ATTEMPT ON UNDERSTANDING HOW IT CAN FUNCTION WITHIN A COMMUNITY GAINS A CONSIDERABLE FOOTHOLD. TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESS IN SUCH AN ATTEMPT, TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSES THAT RESONATE ON THIS GROUND EMERGE CRITICAL: RULE OF LAW AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. ESPECIALLY, THE RECENT COVID PANDEMIC GAVE A CONSIDERABLE CASE STUDY THROUGH WHICH WE CAN COMPLETELY COMPREHEND BOTH OF THE MATTERS OF HOW AI CAN BE USED IN SURVEILLANCE AND HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT IT CAN BE DEMOCRATIZED.
632	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE INSTITUTION OF PARTICIPATORY CITIZENSHIP THROUGH A TAX POLICY, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE CASE OF THE MUNICIPAL TAX COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAO PAULO. IN THIS LINE, THE WORK AIMS TO PROMOTE A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF PARTICIPATORY CITIZENSHIP IN THE FISCAL SPHERE, AS A MEANS OF MATERIALIZING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THUS, BASED ON A THEORETICAL EXAMINATION OF PUBLIC TAX POLICIES AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, THE STUDY SEEKS TO ANSWER THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING SUCH PARTICIPATION BY A TAX POLICY. FOR THAT, THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD WAS CHOSEN AND A BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH OF BOOKS AND QUALIFIED SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES PERTINENT TO THE THEME WAS CARRIED OUT. IN THE END, IT WAS CONCLUDED, THEREFORE, BY THE POSSIBILITY OF A TAX POLICY INSTITUTING PARTICIPATORY CITIZENSHIP, IN THE FISCAL AREA.
633	RESEARCH ON HONG KONG LAWYERS HAS SO FAR FOCUSED ON THEIR INTERNAL DIFFERENCES AND THE RISE OF CAUSE LAWYERING. NOT MUCH HAS BEEN DONE ON THEIR ROLE IN PROMOTING POLITICAL LIBERALISM. THIS PAPER FILLS A GAP BY REVIEWING THE HISTORY OF LAWYERS' POLITICAL ACTIVISM BEFORE AND AFTER HONG KONG'S SOVEREIGNTY SHIFTED FROM A LIBERAL-COLONIAL TO AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME IN 1997. IT ARGUES, FIRST, THAT HONG KONG'S POST-COLONIAL CONSTITUTIONALIZED POLITICS AND PROLONGED DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT HAVE GIVEN THE LEGAL COMPLEX-WHICH INCLUDES LAWYERS AND ALSO INCREASINGLY LEGAL ACADEMICS-A KEY ROLE IN ITS PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT, AND SECOND, CRITICAL POLITICAL JUNCTURES HAVE DRIVEN ACTIVIST LAWYERS TO USE VARIOUS MEANS, FROM ELECTORAL POLITICS TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AND HONG KONG'S TORTUOUS DEMOCRATIZATION.
634	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE VIOLENCE REDUCTION POTENTIAL IN THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN HEALTH, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, AND DEVELOPMENT. IT EMPHASIZES PUBLIC HEALTH, RULE OF LAW, AND EQUALITY-DRIVEN SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS PRINCIPAL CONCERNS IN PREVENTING VIOLENCE. IN PARTS OF LATIN AMERICA, VIOLENCE HAS BECOME A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SECURITY PROBLEM. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH VIOLENCE AS WELL AS EXPERIENCES IN ITS PREVENTION. THESE STUDIES AND EXISTING APPROACHES TO VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON WHERE TO DIRECT ATTENTION AND BUILD PREVENTION EFFORTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR INTEGRATED COMMUNITY-DRIVEN AND NATIONAL INTERVENTIONS TO CREATE COOPERATIVE NATIONAL-LOCAL LINKAGES AND EMBED INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AT THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. NATIONS STRUGGLING WITH VIOLENCE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AND REINFORCE HUMAN SECURITY.
635	AFTER CONSIDERING THE REPEATED DELAYS IN THE ELECTION OF BODIES SUCH AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIAL POWER, AUDIT COURT AND OMBUDSMAN, THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THIS OUTCOME IS IN A LARGE PROPORTION INDUCED BY THE REQUIREMENT OF A VERY HIGH PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY FOR THE RENEWALS. THAT IS THE CASE OF A MAJORITY OF THREE FIFTHS OF THE MEMBERS OF EACH HOUSE. THIS REQUIREMENT, INTRODUCED WITH THE PRAISEWORTHY PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THAT THE COMPOSITION OF THESE BODIES FALLS UNDER THE EXCLUSIVE INFLUENCE OF THE DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY, HAS DETERMINED A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL DEADLINES FOR RENEWALS. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE OUTCOME IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW AND CONSEQUENTLY SHOULD BE AMENDED, SOFTENING THE MAJORITIES REQUIRED.
636	RECENT CONTROVERSIES INVOLVING THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE (CJP) LEND THE AUTHOR TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT ORGANIZATIONS. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT WE DISCIPLINE JUDGES TO VINDICATE THREE VALUES: DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW: AND ADHERENCE TO PUBLIC NORMS OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. AGAINST EACH OF THESE GOALS STAND DIFFERENT FACETS OF THE NORM OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT TRADITIONAL MECHANISMS OF JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE TYPICALLY SERVE ONE GOAL AND HAVE STRUCTURAL LIMITS TO AVOID EXCESSIVE ENCROACHMENTS UPON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. HE THEN COMPARES THE CJP WITH THE FEDERAL JUDICIAL COUNCILS, AND INDICATES THAT STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE PRAISE AND CRITICISM THEY EACH RECEIVE. THE COMMENT CONCLUDES WITH SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CJP.
637	WHAT MAKES A PERSON A GOOD JUDGE? WHICH CHARACTERISTICS, ABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS MATTER IN THE PRACTICE OF ADJUDICATING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS? SOME FACTORS SEEM CRUCIAL, OR EVEN INDISPENSABLE, AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE WORK OF ROSALIE ABELLA BEFORE AND ON THE BENCH. THE FIRST FACTOR IS A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW NOT AS AN EMPTY CONCEPT, BUT AS A SUBSTANTIVE GUARANTEE, LAST NOT LEAST A 'NEVER AGAIN' TO FASCISM AND SIMILARLY AUTOCRATIC REGIMES. SECOND, JUDGES NEED A PARTICULAR REALISM, INFORMED BY ASKING QUESTIONS AND GIVING PEOPLE VOICE, TO APPROACH THE WORLD WITH A DISTINCTLY STRONG HUMILITY. THIRD, RADICAL PRAGMATISM ALLOWS FOR LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT MATTER, BOTH BASED IN DOCTRINE AND MOVING BEYOND, WHILE FOURTH, A NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF UNIVERSALISM MUST INFORM ANY JUDGES' TAKE ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE ENTANGLED WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY.
638	INTELLIGENCE IS AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL FOR MAKING STRATEGIC DECISIONS. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT PERCEIVED AS SUCH BY BROAD SECTORS OF ARGENTINIAN SOCIETY. THIS WORK EXPLORES SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FOUNDATIONS OF THE ABSENCE OF INTELLIGENCE CULTURE, IN A RELEVANT PERIOD DUE TO SEVERAL SERIOUS EVENTS, TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF NORMATIVE BASES AND THEIR CORRECT APPLICATION IN SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. TO THIS END, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THAT VISION ARE EXPLORED, DELVING INTO BOTH THE DOCTRINE AND THE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THEIR APPLICATION AND IMPACT: ITS PUBLIC FUNCTION, CLOSELY RELATED TO THE PERCEPTION OF THE USEFULNESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS SERVICES; AND THE ALLOCATION AND USE OF EARMARKED BUDGET EXPENSES. FINALLY, CONCLUSIONS AND STRATEGIES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CULTURE OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A RULE OF LAW ARE PRESENTED.
639	THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND CO2 EMISSIONS IN TOP NATURAL RESOURCE DEPENDING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2015. AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE. THE ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES FIXED EFFECTS GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES METHODS AND TWO-STEP GMM ESTIMATORS ARE USED FOR PANEL DATA. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY HAS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PER CAPITA CO2 EMISSIONS. THE ESTIMATES SHOW THAT 1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION LEADS TO 1.25% DECREASE IN CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA. WE ALSO FIND THAT RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION DECREASES CO2 EMISSIONS FASTER IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA HAS INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP WITH CO2 EMISSIONS.
640	RENEWABLE ENERGY MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED IN COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI). DESPITE HAVING ABUNDANT RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, THESE COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE ONLY A SMALL SHARE OF GLOBAL RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE NEXUS BETWEEN GOVERNANCE, RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT, AND TRADE OPENNESS FOR A SAMPLE OF 51 BRI COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2017. SPECIFICALLY, THE GRAVITY MODEL OF TRADE IS USED TO DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE FOR TRADE OPENNESS. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS REVEAL THAT POLITICAL STABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE RENEWABLE ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN BRI COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, THIS RELATIONSHIP SEEMS TO DEPEND ON THE DEGREE OF TRADE OPENNESS. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO VARIOUS ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATIONS. (C) 2021 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
641	THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW INCOME-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE AFFECTS INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WITH DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) AND TOBIT REGRESSIONS. NINE BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED CONCEPTS OF GOVERNANCE ARE USED: POLITICAL (VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE), ECONOMIC (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY) AND INSTITUTIONAL (CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW) GOVERNANCES. THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT 'MIDDLE INCOME'-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE HAS A HIGHER EFFECT ON INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THAN 'LOW INCOME'-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF: (I) THE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF FINDINGS; (II) THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF A HIGHER INCOME LEVEL IN THE POST-2015 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA; AND (III) INCONSISTENT STRANDS IN THE LITERATURE AND IN FOREIGN AID POLICIES.
642	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16 COMMITS TO 'PROMOTE PEACEFUL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL AND BUILD EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTABLE AND INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS'. WHILE THE CONCERNS OF SDG16 WITH VIOLENCE REDUCTION, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNANCE ARE RELEVANT TO ALL SOCIETIES, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE THE HARDEST TASK IN ACHIEVING SDG16. IT ANALYSES HOW HIGHER EDUCATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS-OR DETRACT FROM-SDG16 THROUGH TEACHING, RESEARCH, GOVERNANCE, AND EXTERNAL LEADERSHIP. IT THEN ANALYSES FOUR DYNAMICS INFLUENCING THE AGENCY OF UNIVERSITIES IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED CONTEXTS IN ENGAGING WITH SDG16: RESOURCE MOBILISATION AND THE PUBLIC GOOD; SECURITISATION; ACADEMIC FREEDOM, INSECURITY, AND POLITICISATION; AND TENSIONS BETWEEN DEMANDS FOR LOCALISATION AND THE UNIVERSALISING LOGICS OF LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING MODELS AND THE SDGS.
643	DESPITE REPEATED UN CRITICISM, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ECONOMIC RIGHTS REMAIN MARGINALIZED IN CONSTITUTIONAL AND QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. THE LEVERS THAT COULD INCREASE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE RIGHTS ARE UNDERUSED AT BEST, AND THE STATUS QUO CONTINUES TO DEPRIVE THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN SOCIETY OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE. A SOCIO-LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL CULTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA MAJORITY, CARRIED OUT AS PART OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, PROVIDES US WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS SITUATION. IT REVEALS THAT JUDGES' PRACTICES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND VALUES WITH RESPECT TO RIGHTS HOLDERS, GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND LEGAL METHODOLOGY REFLECT AN OUTDATED HUMAN RIGHTS PARADIGM THAT REDUCES CONSTITUTIONALISM AND SUPPORTS THE HEGEMONIC "PURITY" OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE DEPRIVING SOCIETY'S MOST VULNERABLE OF THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
644	WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUALISM-A DIMENSION OF CULTURE THAT IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP-ON VENTURE-CAPITAL INVESTMENTS USING A LARGE CROSS-COUNTRY SAMPLE. OUR SAMPLE CONSISTS OF 1496 COUNTRY-YEAR OBSERVATIONS AND INCLUDES 88 COUNTRIES FROM 1998 TO 2014. CONTROLLING FOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CULTURE, WE FIND THAT INDIVIDUALISM IS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO VENTURE-CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND EXPLAINS 30% OF CROSS-COUNTRY VARIATION. THIS RESULT IS STABLE ACROSS DIFFERENT SUBSAMPLES, SEVERAL MEASURES OF VENTURE-CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, AND EVEN HOLDS WHEN USING THE POLITICAL SYSTEM 200 YEARS AGO AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR INDIVIDUALISM. THE QUALITY OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS (RULE OF LAW) AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ATTITUDES (UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE) PARTIALLY MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF INDIVIDUALISM ON VENTURE-CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (GDP PER CAPITA) MODERATE THIS EFFECT.
645	RWANDA HAS RECENTLY REGISTERED ALL LEGAL OWNERS OF LAND AND HAS REQUIRED SPOUSES TO BE REGISTERED AS CO-OWNERS OF JOINT PROPERTY; THIS IS AIMED AT CONTRIBUTING TO THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN, AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS. A 2015 SURVEY EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF LAW AND OFFICIAL PRACTICE ON WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENTWHETHER THEY KNEW THEIR RIGHTS AND WHETHER THEY COULD CLAIM THEM. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE HAS INDEED BEEN SOME IMPACT. THE PROBLEMS OF WOMEN'S SUBORDINATION REMAIN, HOWEVER, GIVEN PATRIARCHAL ATTITUDES, UNEQUALLY SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND A TENSION BETWEEN RWANDA'S ESPOUSAL OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE ONE HAND AND THE PRINCIPLE OF DIALOGUE AND CONSENSUS ON THE OTHER. MOREOVER, THE POSITION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PROPORTION OF WOMEN IN UNREGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS HAS NOT CHANGED. COPYRIGHT (C) 2018 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
646	STYLIZED EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT DEMOCRACIES AND AUTOCRACIES BOTH EXPROPRIATE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT BUT THAT DEMOCRACIES DO SO LESS FREQUENTLY. WHAT EXPLAINS THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN EXPROPRIATION BETWEEN REGIME TYPES? AN ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL EXPROPRIATION ACTS IN 63 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 1960 TO 1990 SHOWS THAT DEMOCRACIES ARE MOST LIKELY TO EXPROPRIATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT WHEN LEADERS FACE LITTLE POLITICAL CONSTRAINT AND WHEN THEY RESIDE IN COUNTRIES WITH FREQUENT LEADERSHIP TURNOVER. AUTOCRATS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO EXPROPRIATE FOREIGN ASSETS WHEN THEY FACE HIGH POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS AND HAVE STAYED IN POWER FOR A LONG TIME. IN ESSENCE, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S POLITICAL INCENTIVE AND POLICY-MAKING CAPACITY DETERMINE THE HOST GOVERNMENT'S EXPROPRIATION DECISIONS. THE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION, INVESTMENT BEHAVIORS, AND THE PROSPECT OF PRIVATIZATION REFORMS.
647	ECO-LABELS HAVE BECOME COMMONPLACE INSTRUMENTS OF SELF-REGULATION. THIS PAPER ANALYZES FIVE FOOD LABELS WITH RESPECT TO THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR INFORMATION. A NEW METHOD TO ANALYZE RELIABILITY IS DEVELOPED. FOR EACH LABEL, FOUR ASPECTS ARE EXAMINED: (1) MENTION OF BIODIVERSITY; (2) REFERENCE TO RULE OF LAW TO ASSURE BUYERS' CONFIDENCE; (3) NOTIFICATION OF FARMERS' COMPLIANCE; AND (4) INFORMATION ON ECOLOGICAL IMPACT. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT ECO-LABELS FAIL TO COMMUNICATE ADEQUATELY; THEY DO NOT DIMINISH THE INFORMATION GAP BETWEEN SELLER AND BUYER. THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS OF THE ECO-LABELS WERE FOUND IN THEIR AMBIGUITY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL THEMES, THEIR FAILURE TO ASSURE THE BUYER ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S ECOLOGICAL IMPACT, THE INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCERS' COMPLIANCE, AND PRESENCE OF RECOMMENDATIONS.

648	THE ORTHODOX ANSWER TO THE QUESTION POSED IN THE TITLE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF INSTITUTIONS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH ACQUIESCENCE TO UNWELCOME PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS. WE INVESTIGATE THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM USING AN EXPERIMENT EMBEDDED WITHIN A REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL SAMPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE TEST HYPOTHESES CONCERNING NOT ONLY THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY ON ACQUIESCENCE, BUT ALSO THE INFLUENCE OF PARTISANSHIP, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SIMPLE INSTRUMENTALISM ON WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT AN OBJECTIONABLE POLICY DECISION. OUR ANALYSES REVEAL THAT LEGITIMACY DOES MATTER FOR ACQUIESCENCE, AND THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS MORE EFFECTIVE AT CONVERTING ITS LEGITIMACY INTO ACCEPTANCE THAN IS CONGRESS. YET, MANY IMPORTANT PUZZLES EMERGE FROM THE DATA (E.G., PARTISANSHIP IS NOT INFLUENTIAL), SO WE CONCLUDE THAT LEGITIMACY THEORY STILL REQUIRES MUCH ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL INQUIRY.
649	WE EXAMINE WHETHER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION ALIGNED WITH STAKEHOLDERS' INTERESTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED CORPORATE CARBON TRANSPARENCY. USING AN INTERNATIONAL SAMPLE OBTAINED FROM THE CDP, WE FIND THAT CORPORATE CARBON TRANSPARENCY-AS MEASURED BY BOTH THE PROPENSITY TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE CARBON INFORMATION AND THE QUALITY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE-IS GREATER WHEN MANAGERS' COMPENSATION CONTRACTS ARE BETTER ALIGNED WITH STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS. FURTHER ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THIS POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP IS STRONGER IN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS WITH A CODE LAW LEGAL SYSTEM, WITH AN INEFFICIENT RULE OF LAW, THAT SHOW STRONG SOCIAL NORMS TOWARD CLIMATE CHANGE, THAT FEATURE COLLECTIVIST SOCIETIES, AND THAT HAVE A LONG-TERM ORIENTATION. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE STAKEHOLDER AGENCY PROBLEM OF VOLUNTARY CARBON DISCLOSURE CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH EXECUTIVE INCENTIVES THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH STAKEHOLDERS' INTERESTS.
650	THE AUTHOR TRIES TO CONSTRUCT A CONSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE DOGMATIC OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. IT ANALYZES THE MAIN INTERPRETIVE LINES OF DOCTRINE AND JURISPRUDENCE, AND CRITICIZES WHAT HE CONSIDERS AN EXCESS OF LEGAL CONSTRUCTIVISM CONSISTING OF THE INVENTION OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO TRANSPARENCY OR A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE TO TRANSPARENCY, THAT IN HIS OPINION DO NOT EXIST IN THE CASE OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF TRANSPARENCY AS AN EXPRESSION AND NECESSARY INSTRUMENT OF THE EXERCISE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AND FOR THE MOST OPTIMAL REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS CONTEXT, TRANSPARENCY BECOMES A CONSTITUTIONAL VALUE THAT MATERIALIZES IN THIS WAY.
651	INTERDISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION OF ADULT AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT KNOWLEDGE INTO THE STUDY AND PROCESS OF COUNTRIES' DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS IS NECESSARY, SO DEMOCRATIZATION DOES NOT BECOME AN INCENDIARY PROCESS FURTHER DESTABILIZING THE PLANET. THE INCOHERENCE IN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE CAN BE RESOLVED BY EMPLOYING INSIGHTS INTO THE POLITICAL REASONING, CULTURE, AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AT KEY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. DRAWING ON CHILTON'S (1988, DEFINING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, BOULDER: LYNNE RIENNER; 1991, GROUNDING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, BOULDER: LYNNE RIENNER) THEORY OF POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, THIS COHERENT MICRO/MACRO CONNECTION IS REQUIRED FOR STUDY OF THE CENTRAL CO-REINFORCING ELEMENTS FOR STABLE DEMOCRACY: CIVIL SOCIETY, POLITICAL SOCIETY, RULE OF LAW, USABLE STATE BUREAUCRACY, INSTITUTIONALIZED ECONOMIC SOCIETY, AND CULTURAL CONDITIONS FOR PSYCHOLOGICALLY HEALTHY POWER RELATIONS. DEVELOPMENTAL ANALYSES OF THESE FACTORS PROVIDE THE COMPELLING THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THE POLITICAL SCIENCE OF DEMOCRATIZATION REQUIRES.
652	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW ON CORPORATE ESG PERFORMANCE AND THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES USING THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES (DID) MODEL. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE ESG PERFORMANCE OF LISTED COMPANIES IN CHINA'S HEAVILY POLLUTING INDUSTRIES. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES CAN POSITIVELY MODERATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW AND ESG. THE BOOSTING EFFECT OF THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW ON CORPORATE ESG PERFORMANCE IS STRONGER IN THE GROUPING OF HIGH RULE OF LAW LEVELS, HIGH MEDIA ATTENTION AND LARGE CORPORATIONS. UNDER THE DOUBLE CARBON TARGET, THIS STUDY IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO REALIZE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENTERPRISES AND THE HIGH QUALITY DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL ECONOMY.
653	IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE THE LINK BETWEEN CULTURE, MEASURED BY COLLECTIVISM, AND COMMONALITY IN LIQUIDITY FOR 51 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1985 TO 2012. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT COMMONALITY IN LIQUIDITY IS HIGHER FOR STOCKS THAT TRADE IN COLLECTIVIST COUNTRIES, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR SUPPLY-SIDE AND DEMAND-SIDE DETERMINANTS OF LIQUIDITY AS WELL AS A HOST OF COUNTRY- AND FIRM-LEVEL VARIABLES. THE DOCUMENTED RELATION IS SHOWN TO BE MODERATED BY COUNTRY-LEVEL VARIABLES SUCH AS MEDIA PENETRATION, TRUST, AND RULE OF LAW. THE IMPACT OF COLLECTIVISM IS STATISTICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO: ALTERNATIVE PROXIES FOR COLLECTIVISM, SAMPLE COMPOSITION, ENDOGENEITY CONCERNS, AND ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATION METHODOLOGIES. WE FINALLY OBSERVE THAT COLLECTIVISM HAS A STRONGER INFLUENCE ON CO-MOVEMENTS BETWEEN STOCK AND MARKET LIQUIDITY WHEN BOTH ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY DECREASING.
654	THIS INTRODUCTION OFFERS AN OVERVIEW OF THE 2002 RUSSIAN ANTI-EXTREMISM LAW AND A SUMMARY OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS BY INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS TO THIS SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUE. THE AUTHORS DETAIL THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE LAW, PARTICULARLY FOR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. THEY NOTE THAT THE AUTHORS APPROACH THE LAW FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES, RANGING FROM THE EVOLVING RHETORIC OF EXTREMISM IN RUSSIA AND THE LAW'S APPLICATION TO PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS MINORITY CASES TO THE CENSORSHIP OF THE ONLINE WORLD AND THE POLITICIZED AND PARTISAN NATURE OF THE RUSSIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. IN DOING SO, THEY DRAW OUT THE CONTRADICTIONS, INCONSISTENCIES, AND ARBITRARINESS OF THE LAW'S APPLICATION AND SOME UNEXPECTED CONTINUITIES WITH EARLIER HISTORICAL PERIODS. OVERALL, THEY CONCLUDE THAT THE ANTI-EXTREMISM LAW REPRESENTS A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA.
655	MATE SZABO WRITES ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN POSITION AND RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP AND LINK IS BETWEEN THE OMBUDSMAN AND THE CITIZENS WHO BREAK THE LAW FOCUSING ON THE PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. MATE SZABO THINKS THAT BOTH OF THE TWO ROLES ARE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE "CULTURE OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS" (REACTIVE ROLE) AND ALSO TO IMPROVE THEM (PROACTIVE ROLE). BOTH OF THE OMBUDSMAN POSITION AND THE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ARE IN AN INTERMEDIARY SPHERE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY, BUT THE OMBUDSMAN IS NEARER TO THE "UPPER" POLE, THE AREAS OF CONSTITUTION, RULE OF LAW AND PRACTICE OF LAW. THE STUDY THEN ANALYZES THE POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS OF THE HUNGARIAN OMBUDSMAN SYSTEM AND FINALLY INTRODUCES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS BY SUGGESTING CREATING A SPECIAL OMBUDSMAN POSITION.
656	POST-CONFLICT CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS FOR THE WORST OF CRIMES CAN PLAY A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN ACHIEVING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. THIS ONCE-COMMON VIEW HAS RECENTLY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WIDESPREAD CRITICISM THAT IS ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS UNDERMINE RECONCILIATION. THIS HAS LEAD SOME SCHOLARS TO ARGUE THAT WE MUST EITHER ABANDON CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS POST-CONFLICT OR THAT WE OUGHT TO USE THEM FOR MORE GENERAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AIMS, LIKE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES AGAINST ABANDONING CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS POST CONFLICT AND AGAINST SUBSUMING CRIMINAL JUSTICE AIMS UNDER RESTORATIVE OR RECONCILIATORY AIMS. WHEN POST-CONFLICT CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS ARE PROPERLY STRUCTURED AND PRACTICED THEY CAN BOLSTER RESPECT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL AND DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW AND IN THAT WAY LIMIT CONFLICT IN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT WAYS.
657	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE ON THE VENTURE CAPITAL (VC) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY, IT CONTRASTS VC DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES TAKING PLACE IN STABLE AND VOLATILE FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. IT SHOWS THAT FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE - BOTH IMPROVEMENT AND DECLINE - FACILITATES THE VC DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, AND THAT MORE CHANGE IS MORE BENEFICIAL TO THAT PROCESS THAN LESS CHANGE. MACRO INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE PLAYS A LARGER ROLE IN FACILITATING THE VC DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAN MICRO INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, AND CHANGES IN TWO MACRO-LEVEL DIMENSIONS RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY - HAVE THE LARGEST POSITIVE IMPACT ON THAT PROCESS. EMPLOYING LONGITUDINAL INTERVIEW AND ARCHIVAL DATA FROM FOUR EMERGING ECONOMIES WITH A RANGE OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND QUALITY LEVELS, BOTSWANA, INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, AND SOUTH AFRICA, EMPIRICAL SUPPORT IS PROVIDED FOR THE PROPOSITIONS.
658	IN WELL-FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACIES, CONSTITUTIONS ARE REVERED AS THE UNWAVERING BACKBONES OF LAW AND ORDER AND PERMANENT RESERVOIRS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. BUT IF LONGEVITY IS THE DEFINING TEST OF A SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTION, THEN EGYPT'S NEW CHARTER - RATIFIED BY POPULAR REFERENDUM IN DECEMBER 2012 - IS ALREADY IN DANGER OF FAILING. THIS ESSAY, WHICH DRAWS ON CONVERSATIONS WITH EGYPTIAN JUDGES AND LAWYERS IN 2013, WILL ARGUE THAT THE ILLEGITIMACY AND AMBIGUITY OF EGYPT'S CONSTITUTION HAS UNDERMINED RULE OF LAW BY INSUFFICIENTLY CLARIFYING THE BALANCE OF POWERS BETWEEN RIVAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOW ENGAGED IN FIERCE COMPETITION OVER THE UNCERTAIN CONTOURS. THE EFFECT OF THE RESULTING POWER STRUGGLE HAS BEEN A SHARP DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY PERCEIVED AS PARTISAN ACTORS PRIORITIZING THEIR OWN INTERESTS OVER THE PUBLIC GOOD.
659	IT IS MORE THAN THREE YEARS SINCE THE HANDOVER FOR HONG KONG TO CHINA. AN ARTICLE IN FORTUNE MAGAZINE SOME TWO YEARS BEFORE THAT, PRONOUNCED THE DEATH OF THE TERRITORY. THE AUTHOR ARGUED: 'AS HONG KONG BECOMES A CAPTIVE COLONY OF BEIJING AND INCREASINGLY BEGINS TO RESEMBLE JUST ANOTHER MAINLAND CITY, GOVERNED BY CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL CONNECTION RATHER THAN THE EVEN-HANDED RULE OF LAW, IT SEEMS DESTINED TO BECOME A GLOBAL BACKWATER'. THE REMARKS WERE NOT WITHOUT POLITICAL SHREWDNESS. WHAT IS STRANGE IS THAT THE AUTHOR LATER SAID THAT HE WAS WRONG IN HIS PROPHECY BECAUSE WHAT HE HAD PREDICTED HAD NOT HAPPENED. IN FACT, DESPITE PLANS TO HOLD THE SECOND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN SEPTEMBER, EVENTS IN HONG KONG SINCE THE HANDOVER ARE INCREASINGLY CONFIRMING THE TRUTH OF HIS OBSERVATIONS OF FIVE YEARS AGO.
660	THIS RESEARCH STUDIES THE 1891' UNITED STATES OF BRAZIL CONSTITUTION AND CORONELISMO, FROM THE CLASSIC BOOK "SAO BERNARDO", WRITTEN BY GRACILIANO RAMOS. THIS ARTICLE MAKES A COUNTERPOINT BETWEEN THE WORK'S NARRATIVE AND BRAZILIAN HISTORY, BY FOCUSING ON THE INFLUENCE OF LANDOWNING COLONELS FROM THE BRAZILIAN EMPIRE UNTIL THE REVOLUTION OF 30. THE COLONEL WAS THE TRADITIONAL FIGURE OF THE REGION, WHO EXERCISED INFLUENCE AND DOMINION OVER ALL BY CHARISMA, ECONOMIC, TECHNICAL OR INTELLECTUAL POWER, AND OFTEN OUT OF FEAR, SINCE IT RESORTED TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO INTIMIDATE AND MANIPULATE THE POPULATION. BRAZILIAN HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE ADOPTION OF FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONAL MODELS, AS OCCURRED IN 1891, ENDED UP STRENGTHENING THE DE FACTO POWER OF LOCAL COLONELS, TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN INSTITUTIONS.
661	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONCEPTUAL INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE FEDERAL MANDATORY IMMIGRATION DETENTION REGIME AND MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, TWO PROCEDURAL AND POLITICAL RESPONSES TO POPULIST CONCERNS REGARDING 'WAVES OF BOAT PEOPLE' AND 'WAVES OF CRIME'. THROUGH A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE 'MANDATORY' CHARACTER OF THESE OSTENSIBLY SEPARATE AND DISTINCT PRACTICES IS SHOWN TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND OVERSIGHT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION. MANDATORY PRACTICES PRIVILEGE GOALS OF DETERRENCE, INCAPACITATION AND RETRIBUTION AND DEPICT THESE AS PROMOTING THE BEST INTERESTS OF NATIONAL SAFETY AND SECURITY. THESE PRACTICES ARE ALSO MARKEDLY SIMILAR IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE AT ODDS WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF DUE PROCESS, UNFAIRLY TIPPING THE BALANCE AWAY FROM INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND TOWARDS THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE, OFFENDING ASPIRATIONAL NOTIONS OF JUDICIAL FUNCTION, THE RULE OF LAW AND NATURAL JUSTICE.
662	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A UNIFYING THEORY TO EXPLAIN JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR IN CHINA. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE DE JURE AND DE FACTO POWER OF THE DISPUTANTS AND THE COURT DETERMINES MANY OF THE ACTIONS OF A CHINESE JUDICIAL DECISION MAKER AT THE THREE STAGES OF LITIGATION: CASE FILING, ADJUDICATION, AND ENFORCEMENT OF COURT DECISIONS. THE THEORY OFFERS A NOVEL ANALYTICAL TOOL TO EXPLAIN AND PREDICT, ALBEIT IN A HIGHLY STYLIZED WAY, WHEN CHINESE COURTS FOLLOW THE LAW, HOW THEY EXERCISE DISCRETION AND WHAT METHODS THEY PREFER IN HANDLING LAWSUITS, AS WELL AS THE FUNCTIONS THE COURTS SERVE IN THE PROCESS. THE THEORY CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ONGOING CHINESE LEGAL REFORMS AND TO THE DEBATE ABOUT JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR IN CHINA AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT ROBUST RULE OF LAW.
663	POSTWAR EL SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO REFORM AND DEMOCRATIZE THE STATE AND TO SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW. EACH COUNTRY ENTERED THE 1990S HOBBLED BY A LEGACY OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE, WHILE A CORRUPT AND POLITICIZED JUDICIARY OFFERED VIRTUALLY NO CHECK ON THE ABUSE OF POWER. BECAUSE THE JUDICIARY HAS PERFORMED POORLY AS AN INSTITUTION OF HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PERFORMANCE OF A NEW "ACCOUNTABILITY AGENCY," THE HUMAN RIGHTS OMBUDSMAN. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED IN EACH COUNTRY, PERCEPTIONS OF ITS PERFORMANCE, AND POLITICAL RESPONSES AS THE OFFICE BEGAN TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTION OF HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE IN THEIR EXERCISE OF POWER. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS NEW OFFICE MAY FALL PREY TO THE SAME WEAKNESSES THAT HAVE PLAGUED OLDER INSTITUTIONS IN BOTH COUNTRIES.
664	THE STUDY PROPOSES AN APPROACH TO THE DEFICIENT PROTECTION OF MINORITIES IN THE AGE OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE, THE CRIMINOLOGICAL ONE, EXAMINING THE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE THROUGH THEORIES OF CONSENSUS AND CONFLICT, AS WELL AS SCHOOLS BORN FROM THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN THE 20TH CENTURY XVIII, PROVIDING A NEW LOOK AT DIVERSITY IN THE SOCIAL CONTEXT. IN ADDITION, IT SEEKS, ABOVE ALL, TO REVEAL A NEW DIMENSION OF HUMAN DIGNITY, ESPECIALLY OF VULNERABLE SOCIAL EXTRACTS, AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE BASIC CORE OF THE CONSTITUCIONAL SYSTEM THAT MUST SEEK ITS VALIDITY AND LEGITIMACY, HENCEFORTH CALLED THE SENSE OF JUSTICE, AMONG OTHERS CONCEPTIONS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THE WORK, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FACING AND TRANSFORMING A CULTURE OF HATE INTO A CULTURE OF PEACE.
665	THIS ARTICLE - BASED ON FIELDWORK CONDUCTED IN SALVADOR, BAHIA, BRAZIL - EXAMINES HOW THOSE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY CARCERAL EXPANSION PURSUE SAFETY IN AN EVERYDAY MARKED BY EXISTENTIAL THREAT. THROUGH A FOCUS ON A NEGLECTED SECTOR OF THIS POPULATION, NAMELY ADULT WOMEN, I SHOW HOW CARCERAL ENCOUNTERS SPECIFICALLY - AND INFORMAL, ILLEGAL AND NOT-YET-(IL)LEGAL EXCHANGES MORE GENERALLY - INTERSECT WITH FAMILIAL LOGICS AND IMPERATIVES TO ENGENDER A CAPACITY FOR ACTION THAT I CALL 'EXTRALEGAL AGENCY'. EXTRALEGAL AGENCY IS CENTRAL TO A PRACTICE OF SAFETY THAT REPRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DOMINANT MODEL OF CARCERAL SECURITY. AN EXTRALEGAL AGENCY APPROACH TO ANALYSING INTERCONNECTED PRISON/URBAN FIELDS, WHICH DECENTRES MASCULINIZED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND RESISTS ROMANTICIZING THE RULE OF LAW, ENABLES A DISRUPTION OF DOMINANT DISCOURSES OF AND ABOUT THE CARCERAL STATE.
666	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE IN PATRICK BRONTE'S LIFE OF HIS EARLY YEARS (1777-1802) IN COUNTY DOWN, IRELAND, AN AREA GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE TUMULTUOUS TURMOIL IN EUROPE, BY VIOLENCE, TREASON, SEDITION AND REBELLION. THE REASONS FOR PATRICK'S 'VOLUNTARY EXILE' FROM HIS HOME ARE EXPLORED AND THE IMPACT ON HIM OF LIFE AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AS A SIZAR ASSESSED. THE IDEA OF THE FAMILY'S SEPARATENESS IS TRACED TO ITS BEGINNINGS IN PATRICK BRONTE'S EARLY YEARS. HIS COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING WERE BASED ON HIS BELIEF IN THE RULE OF LAW, HE HAVING EXPERIENCED THE ATROCITIES AND SAVAGERY OF REBELLION IN HIS YOUTH. HIS SINGULARITY OF MIND, HIS INDIVIDUALISM AND DEDICATION TO HIS WORK AS A CLERGYMAN, ALL RESULTING FROM HIS EARLY EXPERIENCES, INFLUENCED AND INSPIRED HIS FAMILY.
667	THE NEW RIGHT TO MEMORY (LEY N. 52/2007) HAS TO BE INTERPRETED ON THE BASIS OF CULTURAL SCIENCES AND GENERAL THEORY OF LAW. MEMORY ENJOYS CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION THROUGH VARIOUS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES AND INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION THROUGH SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS, ESPECIALLY WITHIN EUROPE. THEY CAN PROTECT AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO REMEMBER OR FORGET FREELY IN CONSCIENCE, A RIGHT TO RECALL FACTS TO THE CONSCIENCE OF OTHERS AND AN INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE RIGHT TO BE REMEMBERED OR NOT. FRANCE, ITALY, GERMANY AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DEVELOPED SPECIFIC POLICIES FOR COLLECTIVE MEMORY, COMBINING AMNESTY WITH ACTIVE ELABORATION. THE SPANISH REGULATIONS ON A DECLARATION OF "REPARACION Y RECONOCIMIENTO PERSONAL", REMOVAL OF SYMBOLS, ACCESS TO ARCHIVES HAVE TO BE CONSTRUED IN A WAY CONSISTENT WITH A RULE OF LAW THAT INCLUDES RIGHTS TO MEMORY.
668	IN "EVALUATING RECIPES FOR DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS" AVINASH DIXIT CRITICIZES RECENT EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY THE "FUNDAMENTAL" CAUSES OF DEVELOPMENT AND TO DISTILL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THESE EFFORTS. THIS COMMENT FOCUSES ON THE STRAND OF THAT LITERATURE RELATED TO INSTITUTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. TWO ARGUMENTS ARE IMPORTANT: THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR GROWTH AND THAT THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. PROFESSOR DIXIT ARGUES THAT IDENTIFICATION AND OTHER CONCERNS UNDERMINE THE SECOND ARGUMENT AND INHIBIT THE FORMULATION OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. WHILE THESE CONCERNS ARE VALID, RESEARCH HAS BEGUN TO DISAGGREGATE BROAD POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS (DEMOCRACY AND AUTOCRACY) AND TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF POLITICAL COMPETITION, SUCH AS VOTER INFORMATION AND POLITICIAN CREDIBILITY, WHICH ARE BOTH MORE ROBUST DETERMINANTS OF POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POLICY INTERVENTIONS.
669	EU ENVIRONMENTAL LAW INCREASINGLY ADOPTS AN IMPACT-BASED REGULATORY STRATEGY THAT PLACES BIOPHYSICAL SCIENCES IN A SIGNIFICANT ROLE NOT ONLY IN DESIGNING REGULATION BUT ALSO IN INTERPRETING AND IMPLEMENTING THE LAW. WHILE CRUCIAL FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, SUCH A REGULATORY STRATEGY CREATES CHALLENGES FOR THE LEGITIMACY OF EU ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE SHIFT FROM A BEHAVIOUR-BASED TO IMPACT-BASED REGULATION IN THIS CONTEXT AND ANALYSES THE LATTER IN LIGHT OF LON L. FULLER'S EIGHT CLASSIC CRITERIA FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO EXPOSE THE LEGITIMACY CHALLENGES. FOCUSING ON THE EU WATER FRAMEWORK DIRECTIVE AND THE LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY REGULATION, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT EU ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SUFFERS FROM SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS IN SECURING LEGAL LEGITIMACY AND CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW THIS MAY BE IMPROVED GOING FORWARD.
670	THIS PAPER RAISES THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER A THEORY OF JUSTICE EXISTS IN EU LAW. THE FOCUS IS ON JUSTICE AS A SYSTEM. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE INDEPENDENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE (MAINLY JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS) VIS-A-VIS EACH OTHER, AND OTHER STATE POWERS, IS KEY TO THAT SYSTEM ACHIEVING JUSTICE AS A VALUE. AGAINST THE BENCHMARK OF JUDICIAL AND PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE DEVELOPED IN EUROPEAN LAW, THE PAPER ASSESSES THE ROLE FOR INDEPENDENCE IN INVESTIGATIVE, PROSECUTORIAL AND ADJUDICATING FUNCTIONS AS IT EMERGES FROM THE CURRENT STATE OF EU CRIMINAL LAW. THE CONCLUSIONS REVEAL THAT THE EU'S IDEA OF JUSTICE REMAINS UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR SYSTEMIC COHERENCE TO BETTER PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AND ENHANCE THE LEGITIMACY OF EU CRIMINAL LAW.
671	THIS PAPER ADOPTS THE META-ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE TO A SAMPLE OF 29 EMPIRICAL ARTICLES TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' CHARACTERISTICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE. THE PAPER ALSO INVESTIGATES WHETHER THE FINDINGS ARE MODERATED BY DIFFERENCES IN COUNTRY-LEVEL FACTORS, SUCH AS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, RULE OF LAW, ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY STRINGENCY AND THE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, AND DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT BOARD SIZE, INDEPENDENCE, GENDER DIVERSITY, ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE AND BOARD MEETINGS SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCE ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE. IN ADDITION, THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION INTERVENES IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOARD SIZE, INDEPENDENCE, CEO DUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE. FINALLY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOARD SIZE, CEO DUALITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE IS MODERATED BY THE MEASUREMENT OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE.
672	THE US COMPLAINT ABOUT CHINESE TARIFF-RATE QUOTAS (TRQS) ON CERTAIN GRAIN PRODUCTS HELPS ILLUSTRATE SEVERAL KEY ISSUES IN US-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WTO DISPUTES. FIRST, DO INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS BASED ON TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS WORK IN RELATION TO AN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRY NOT KNOWN FOR THE RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY? SECOND, CAN THERE BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF A DISPUTE AND THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC INTERESTS, WITH A DSB RULING SOMETIMES NOT LEADING TO IMPROVED TRADE FLOWS? AND THIRD, GIVEN THE BILATERAL TRADE WAR AND 'PHASE ONE' TRADE DEAL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, HAS THE WTO BEEN SUPERSEDED IN THIS TRADE RELATIONSHIP? THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE FACTS AND LAW OF THE CHINA-TRQS DISPUTE, AND EXAMINES EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS IN THAT CONTEXT.
673	THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN ISLAMIC COOPERATION ORGANIZATION COUNTRIES. THE RATIO OF DOMESTIC CREDIT GIVEN TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO GDP IS USED AS A PROXY FOR FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; INCOME LEVEL, BROAD MONEY, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, TRADE OPENNESS, SAVING RATE, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, EXCHANGE RATE, FINAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, AND EXTERNAL DEBT ARE UTILIZED AS DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; CORRUPTION INDEX AND FOUR SUB-LEVELS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS USED AS A PROXY FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY LEVEL. ACCORDING TO THE LINEAR DYNAMIC PANEL DATA ESTIMATION BY USING 1995-2018 PANEL DATA, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE REDUCTION OF CORRUPTION, THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATIONS EFFECTIVENESS, AND OPEN MARKETS POSITIVELY AFFECTED FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT SIZE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
674	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSES OF THE GROWING POPULARITY OF THE ILLIBERAL RIGHT, TAKING THE POLISH POLITICAL PARTY LAW AND JUSTICE AS AN EXAMPLE. THE ADOPTED ANALYTICAL APPROACH COMBINES INSIGHTS DERIVED FROM THE WORK OF KARL POLANYI AND THE TRADITION OF HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISM. THE VICTORY OF LAW AND JUSTICE IN THE 2015 POLISH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IS ARGUED TO CONSTITUTE A CRITICAL JUNCTURE THAT INITIATED A FUNDAMENTAL BREAK WITH THE LIBERAL ORDER. FOLLOWING POLANYI, WE ARGUE THAT THE SEEDS OF THE RECENT ANTI-LIBERAL COUNTER-REVOLUTION CAN BE FOUND IN THE MALFUNCTIONING OF THE POLISH ECONOMIC ORDER BUILT DURING THE PERIOD OF TRANSITION. HOWEVER, LAW AND JUSTICE HAS MANAGED TO MAKE USE OF THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE ARISING FROM SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND HAS USED IT INSTRUMENTALLY TO DISMANTLE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW.
675	IN LATIN AMERICA, MOST COUNTRIES HAVE A DECENTRALIZED BARGAINING STRUCTURE THAT IS IN THE COMPANY'S MAIN AREA OF NEGOTIATION AND DIFFERENT FROM THE WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS AND PROMOTION DERIVING FROM THE NEW LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM EMERGED AFTER THE FALL OF DICTATORSHIPS IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE PAST CENTURY. IN PERU, THE LEGISLATIVE OPTION ENFORCES A HYPER-DECENTRALIZED MODEL THAT HAS RESTRICTED MAXIMUM COVERAGE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COLLECTIVE PROTECTION. THEREFORE, THE STATE REGULATION REFERRED TO THE ARTICULATED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS NOT COMPLETE BECAUSE IT IGNORES ISSUES SUCH AS THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF JUNCTURE, THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTS, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, ETC. THE WEAKNESS OF THE COLLECTIVE PROTECTION HAS TRANSCENDED THE SPECIFIC FIELD OF BUSINESS AND QUESTIONS THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL BALANCES THAT UNDERPIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW.
676	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORIC USES OF THE PHENOMENON RECENTLY DEFINED AS 'DEEP POLITICS' TO SHED LIGHT ON THE UNDERLYING REALITIES OF THE CONTEMPORARY WAR ON TERROR. DEEP POLITICS DESCRIBES THE MULTIPLE USES OF MISINFORMATION TO MARSHAL PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN DIRECTIONS DESIRED BY DOMINANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FORCES. FACING THE REALITY OF DEEP POLITICS TODAY CAN BE A DISILLUSIONING EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE WEDDED TO THE RHETORICAL TROPES OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, AS THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ILLUSTRATE, DRAWING ON INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE PRACTICE, DISILLUSIONMENT CAN BE THE FIRST STEP IN A LONGER PROCESS OF CULTURAL HEALING, AWAY FROM NAIVE REALISM TO AN APPRECIATION OF THE SACREDNESS, OR WHOLENESS, OF LIFE, AND THE COURAGE TO FACE AND DEAL WITH THE BROADER TRUTH OF THINGS.
677	IN RECENT YEARS, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT'S FEDERALISM JURISPRUDENCE HAS SHIELDED STATES FROM CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CONGRESS'S POLICYMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. THROUGH ITS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND OF THE TENTH AND ELEVENTH AMENDMENTS, THE COURT HAS REMINDED CONGRESS THAT ITS POWER TO GOVERN HAS LIMITS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE MAJOR FEDERALISM CASES OF THE 1990S, FOCUSING ON ALDEN V. MAINE, THE MOST IMPORTANT FEDERALISM DECISION OF THE 1998-1999 TERM. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT AND THE SOVEREIGN-IMMUNITY DOCTRINE, WHICH HAS CONSTRAINED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S POWER TO AUTHORIZE PRIVATE SUITS AGAINST STATES FOR VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LAW POSES A THREAT TO A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW: 'WHERE THERE IS A RIGHT, THERE IS A REMEDY. ".
678	ARTICLE 257(6) OF THE 1992 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA CREATES A REGALIAN MINERAL OWNERSHIP REGIME. EVERY MINERAL IN ITS NATURAL STATE WITHIN THE TERRITORY OF GHANA IS THE PROPERTY OF GHANA, AND IS VESTED IN THE PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF AND IN TRUST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GHANA. THE TRUST RELATIONSHIP CREATED BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE PEOPLE OF GHANA IN THE MINERAL OWNERSHIP HAS BEEN DETERMINED AS NOMINAL AND, THEREFORE, NOT JUSTICIABLE. CITIZENS' LACK OF POWER TO QUESTION THE PRESIDENT IN THE EXERCISE OF MINERAL RIGHTS IN COURT IS A DRAWBACK FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, SEPARATION OF POWERS, RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL REVIEW, ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE GENERALLY. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE THEORY OF NOMINAL TRUSTEESHIP IN THE REGALIAN MINERAL OWNERSHIP REGIME IN GHANA.
679	THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEUTRAL, PROFESSIONAL BUREAUCRACY HAS BEEN A PROFOUND CONCERN FOR EMERGING DEMOCRACIES. INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC ACTORS HAVE EXPENDED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, YET MANY POSTCOMMUNIST SOCIETIES REMAIN MIRED IN CORRUPTION. WHEN CORRUPT BEHAVIORS ARE INTEGRATED WITH A CORE FUNCTION OF DEMOCRATIC STATES, SUCH AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, THE IMPLICATIONS OF FAILURES TO PROFESSIONALIZE BUREAUCRATS ARE ENHANCED. THIS ARTICLE EMPIRICALLY EVALUATES HOW PROFESSIONALIZATION AND CORRUPTION INTERACT IN ELECTION ADMINISTRATION, USING UNIQUE SURVEY DATA FROM UKRAINE. WE ASSESS THE RESULTS OF PRE- AND POSTELECTION SURVEYS OF ADMINISTRATORS CONDUCTED ACROSS UKRAINE DURING THE 2014 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ASPECTS OF A PROFESSIONALIZED BUREAUCRACY COEXIST WITH CORRUPTION AND THAT MITIGATING INCENTIVES FOR STATE CAPTURE IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION.
680	TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN JUSTICE ARE HALLMARKS OF AN OPEN SOCIETY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM, IN PARTICULAR GENERAL DIGITISATION, THE ARRIVAL OF THE ONLINE SOLUTIONS COURT AND THE USE OF CASE OFFICERS AND CASE LAWYERS TO MAKE DECISIONS, MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY WHICH CONTINUES TO UPHOLD THESE PRINCIPLES. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PUBLIC DEBATE ON HOW THIS WILL WORK IN PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPORTANCE OF OPEN JUSTICE AND HOW PRESENT PRACTICE MIGHT HELP TO SHAPE OPENNESS IN THE POST REFORM WORLD. THE JUDICIARY HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT REFORMED PROCESSES DO NOT IMPINGE ON TRANSPARENCY OR OPENNESS. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THOSE STEERING REFORM ARE WELL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERCOMING THEM.
681	DAVID BEN-GURION IS USUALLY CONSIDERED A LABOR LEADER OR A ZIONIST NATIONAL LEADER AND IS LESS REMEMBERED AS A CIVILIAN HEAD OF STATE. NEVERTHELESS, AS PREMIER OF A FLEDGLING STATE, HE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING ISRAEL'S CIVIL INSTITUTIONS AND ESTABLISHING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW THAT BEN-GURION'S POLICY AS APOLITICAL LEADER WAS DERIVED FROM A WELL-DEFINED CIVIC WORLDVIEW ENCAPSULATED IN THE IDEA OF "MAMLAKHTIYUT." BEN-GURION UNDERSTOOD "MAMLAKHTIYUT" AS AN AWARENESS OF SOCIETY'S NEED TO FUNCTION AS A CIVILIZED, INDEPENDENT POLITY MANIFESTING CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION, RESPECTING DEMOCRACY, AND UPHOLDING LAW AND ORDER. IT IS ARGUED THAT BEN-GURION'S CIVIC IDEAS CAN BEST BE EXPLAINED BY THE POLITICAL THEORY KNOWN IN THE LAST 40 YEARS AS "REPUBLICANISM."
682	WHEN CIVIL SOCIETY IS UNDEVELOPED, AND WHEN THE STATE IS TOO WEAK AND POOR TO TREAT ALL CITIZENS EQUALLY, DEMOCRATISATION MAY STIR UP RATHER THAN ALLEVIATE ETHNIC CONFLICTS. IRAQ HAD BOTH OF THESE DISADVANTAGES WHEN IT GAINED INDEPENDENCE IN 1932, AND ITS POLITICAL HISTORY SINCE THEN HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY INCREASING FRAGMENTATION AND CONFLICT ALONG ETHNIC LINES. THERE ARE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS THAT MAY HELP IN A DEMOCRATIC IRAQ TO PREVENT ESCALATION OF THESE CONFLICTS: AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM THAT FAVOURS VOTE POOLING ACROSS ETHNIC LINES; FEDERALISM ON A NON-ETHNIC BASIS WITH A STRONG COMPONENT OF FISCAL DECENTRALISATION; A STRONG REGIME OF MINORITY RIGHTS; AND A JUDICIARY APPARATUS CAPABLE OF ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW. THE UN IS BETTER SUITED THAN A US ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE OUTSIDE SUPPORT FOR THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION.
683	WE EXAMINE THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (IQ) AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) NEXUS ACROSS 10 MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN (MENA) COUNTRIES FROM 1990 TO 2018 BASED ON DISAGGREGATED FDI DATA IN THE PRIMARY (EXTRACTIVE), SECONDARY (MANUFACTURING) AND TERTIARY (SERVICE) SECTORS. THERE IS PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE THAT IQ PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DETERMINING FDI AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL IN THE MENA REGION. ONCE WE USE SECTORAL FDI FLOWS DATA, IQ IS IRRELEVANT TO FDI INFLOWS INTO THE PRIMARY SECTOR. FOUR ASPECTS OF IQ: RULE OF LAW INDEX, ACCOUNTABILITY INDEX, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE AGGREGATE IQ INDEX, HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT SECONDARY AND TERTIARY FDI INFLOWS INTO THE MENA REGION, WHILE CORRUPTION ONLY PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT PART IN REDUCING FDI IN THE TERTIARY SECTOR. IMPROVING IQ IS THUS KEY TO ATTRACTING MORE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE SECTOR FDI.
684	THE PROPOSED WORK AIMS TO QUESTION THE CONDITIONS AND POSSIBILITIES OF RULE OF LAW AS AN EXPRESSION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY TO ACT AND FUNCTION AS A SKILLFUL INSTRUMENT TO EFFECTIVELY REGULATE SUCH RELATIONS - BETWEEN LAW AND TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE TRANSFORMATIONS AND IMPACTS PRODUCED BY THE INTERNET REVOLUTION IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES, RESPONDING TO EMERGING CONFLICTS IN THIS CONTEXT. TO ANSWER THESE AND OTHER QUESTIONS, THE HERMENEUTIC-PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH METHOD WAS USED, THROUGH THE INTERPRETATIVE REFLECTION ON THE OBJECT AND THE CONTEXT, SEEKING TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN WHAT THE THEORY SAYS, THE LAW AND WHAT THE CONCRETE REALITY PRESENTS. BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH WAS USED, NOTING THERE IS A NEED FOR A REGULATION BEYOND THE STATE THAT CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISH REGULATORY PARAMETERS THAT DIALOGUE WITH CIVILIZING ACHIEVEMENTS AND, ABOVE ALL, WITH HUMAN RIGHTS.
685	THE CHALLENGING INTERNATIONAL GEOPOLITICAL CONTEXT AND THE PRIMARY FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXTERNAL ACTION (IN ITS POLITICAL, LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION) POINTS TO THE EMERGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GLOBAL STRATEGY ON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY, AND THE AMBITION OF STRATEGIC AUTONOMY AS SUPPORT FOR PEACE AND A SAFER WORLD. IT IS INTERESTING TO STUDY, FROM A SHARED VISION AND COMMON ACTION, WHAT THE MANDATE OF THIS STRATEGY IS IN ORDER TO DEDUCE WHETHER THIS OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE IS BEING BUILT AND CONSOLIDATED WITH LEGAL PARAMETERS. THAT IS, IN A WORLD ORDER BASED ON NORMS AND MULTILATERALISM, ARE THE MEASURES OF A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OF RESPECT AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND THE RULE OF LAW (ARTICLE 3.5 OF THE TEU) BEING ADOPTED?
686	THIS ANALYSIS INTENDS TO OFFER A CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE EXPLANATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LABOR LAW. FOR THIS, IT IS RELEVANT TO IDENTIFY EACH DOCTRINAL AND CASE-LAW PRINCIPLE, AS THEY ALLOW ESTABLISHING TRULY DIFFERENTIATING CATEGORIES WHEN THEY ARE CORRELATED AND PLACED WITHIN LABOR LAW, UNDERSTOOD AS A SOCIAL OBLIGATION. MOST EXPERTS HAVE RESTRICTED THEMSELVES TO CONSIDERING THIS LAW BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LABOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, TOGETHER WITH PUBLIC LAW, AND NOT AS A PART OF LABOR LAW. THIS CONCEPTION IS ADMINISTRATIVIST AND IGNORES THE WORK ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE FRAMEWORK OF ECONOMIC COORDINATION AND SOCIAL BALANCE THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER AT PRESENT. AS SUCH, THE STATE SHOULD GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION AS SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
687	INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANKS PREFER BALANCED BUDGETS DUE TO THE LONG-RUN CONNECTION BETWEEN DEFICITS AND INFLATION, AND CAN ENFORCE THEIR PREFERENCE THROUGH INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND DENIAL OF CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LEGAL CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE (CBI) DETERS FISCAL DEFICITS PREDOMINANTLY IN COUNTRIES WITH RULE OF LAW AND IMPARTIAL CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, A FREE PRESS AND CONSTRAINTS ON EXECUTIVE POWER. IT FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT CBI MAY NOT AFFECT FISCAL DEFICITS IN A COUNTER-CYCLICAL FASHION, BUT INSTEAD DEPENDING ON THE ELECTORAL CALENDAR AND GOVERNMENT PARTISANSHIP. THE ARTICLE ALSO TESTS THE NOVEL HYPOTHESES USING NEW YEARLY DATA ON LEGAL CBI FOR SEVENTY-EIGHT COUNTRIES FROM 1970 TO 2007. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CBI RESTRAINS DEFICITS ONLY IN DEMOCRACIES, DURING NON-ELECTION YEARS AND UNDER LEFT GOVERNMENT TENURES.
688	THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME HAS BECOME A TOP SECURITY PRIORITY FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). WHILE A NEW POLICY AREA IS EMERGING, IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHO IS IN LEAD AND HOW THE PROCESS DEVELOPS. THIS ARTICLE DELVES INTO THE POST-LISBON EU SECURITY MODEL, EXPLORING HOW WASHINGTON AND BRUSSELS COLLABORATE IN COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN A CONTEXT OF CHANGING DEFINITIONS, ACTORS AND POLICIES. IT ARGUES THAT US DEFINITIONS, OPERATIONAL MODELS AND POLICIES INFLUENCE EU INSTITUTIONAL THINKING AND POLICIES, SHIFTING THE EMPHASIS FROM PREVENTION AND RULE OF LAW TO EXECUTION AND INTELLIGENCE. THE DYNAMICS OF POLICY CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE ON CRIMINAL MATTERS IN THE TRANSATLANTIC COMMUNITY REFLECT TECTONIC SHIFTS IN THE DEEPEST LEVELS OF THINKING SECURITY IN THE WEST, AFFECTING THE MOULDING OF A EUROPEAN SECURITY IDENTITY.
689	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS UNDERSTOOD AS A CORNERSTONE OF RULE-OF-LAW AND, AS SUCH, AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS. BUT IN CONTEXTS OF DEMOCRATIZATION, THE DEFINITION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE MAY REQUIRE REFINEMENT TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES OF MOVING FROM THE RULE OF THE FEW TO THE RULE OF THE MANY. IN PARTICULAR, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY MAY STALL LEGISLATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM BY ENGAGING IN A FORM OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW DESIGNED TO SHIELD ELITE PREFERENCES FROM DEMOCRATIC REVERSAL. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THIS PROBLEM THROUGH A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF A RECENT SET OF CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL CASES IN TURKEY TO ILLUSTRATE THE RISKS OF A NARROW DEFINITION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND EXPLORE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE JUDICIARY IN PERIODS OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION OR DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION.
690	THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION ('EAEU') - AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION IN POST-SOVIET SPACE - HAS A JUDICIAL BODY AIMED AT ENSURING UNIFORM APPLICATION OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EAEU COURT WILL STRUGGLE IN ACHIEVING ITS AIM AS THERE ARE ISSUES OF INDEPENDENCE, IT HAS DIMINISHED POWERS, AND LIMITS HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON ITS INTERPRETATIVE PRACTICES, AT LEAST AS COMPARED TO ITS PREDECESSOR. THIS MAY LEAD TO PROBLEMS IN RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW AND `DIS-INTEGRATES' THE JUDICIARY IN THE SENSE OF A COMMON SYSTEM INVOLVING NATIONAL COURTS. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS ALSO ARGUED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE COURT'S PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE POWERS HAVE BEEN LIMITED, THE ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CERTAIN INTERPRETATIVE POWERS OF THE COURT CAN HARDLY RESULT IN MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW.
691	UK NATIONALS WILL LOSE THEIR EU CITIZENSHIP STATUS AS A RESULT OF THE BREXIT REFERENDUM. TO PREVENT THIS, SEVERAL COMMENTATORS, INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT BREXIT NEGOTIATOR GUY VERHOFSTADT, PROPOSED TO GRANT ASSOCIATE EU CITIZENSHIP TO UK NATIONALS TO SAFEGUARD THEIR RIGHTS AS EU CITIZENS AFTER BREXIT. WE MAKE THE CASE AGAINST ASSOCIATE EU CITIZENSHIP, DISMISSING IT ON THREE GROUNDS. FIRST, IT VIOLATES THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF EU LAW. SECOND, IT VIOLATES CORE EU VALUES, INCLUDING THE EU'S PROMISE TO RESPECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS OF MEMBER STATES AND THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIRD, IT IS AGAINST EU'S INTERESTS, AS ASSOCIATE EU CITIZENSHIP FAILS TO RESPECT RECIPROCITY IN EU RELATIONS WITH THIRD COUNTRIES AND UNDERMINES THE COHERENCE OF THE EDIFICE OF EU CONSTITUTIONALISM.
692	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCESSES OF CONTESTATION AND LOCALISATION OF NORMS IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES VIA A BOURDIEU-INSPIRED ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS OF SECURITY PRIVATISATION IN TWO FORMER YUGOSLAV COUNTRIES: BOSNIA AND SERBIA. BY DRAWING ON BOURDIEU'S CONCEPTS OF FIELD, HABITUS, CAPITAL AND STRATEGIES, THIS PAPER SHEDS LIGHT ON THE WAYS IN WHICH, IN BOSNIA AS WELL AS IN SERBIA, A PARTICULAR HABITUS AND FORMS OF CAPITAL INHERITED FROM THESE POLITIES' VIOLENT PAST HAVE SHAPED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LIBERAL PROJECT OF SECURITY PRIVATISATION. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A SITUATION IN WHICH LEGISLATION AND INSTITUTIONS AIMED AT PROMOTING A LIBERAL MODEL OF SECURITY PROVISION CO-EXIST WITH PRACTICES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
693	WILL THE WELFARE STATE SURVIVE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION? THE PAPER SEEKS TO PUT THIS CURRENTLY INTENSE DEBATE INTO CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVES. IT STARTS WITH A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE DEBAT FONDATEUR IN POST-WAR GERMANY ON THE NEW BASIC LAW, WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON ALLEGED OR REAL TENSIONS OF WELFARISM WITH RECHTSSTAATLICHKEIT, THE COMMITMENT TO RULE OF LAW. THIS IS THE BACKGROUND FOR THE DISCUSSION IN SECTION II ON LEGAL CATEGORIES, WHICH FRITZ SCHARPF HAS CHARACTERISED AS A DE-COUPLING OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION FROM THE VARIOUS WELFARE TRADITIONS OF MEMBER STATES. THE THIRD SECTION ANALYSES THE ECJ'S RECENT LABOUR LAW JURISPRUDENCE WITH ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE SUPREMACY OF EUROPEAN FREEDOMS AND ITS RIGID INTERPRETATION OF PERTINENT SECONDARY LEGISLATION. THESE CONTROVERSIAL MOVES ARE BOUND TO PROVOKE FIERCE OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE PROTAGONISTS OF "SOCIAL EUROPE."
694	AS THE INTERNET HAS BECOME A MAINSTREAM COMMUNICATIONS MECHANISM, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE DEVELOPED NEW SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES AND BEEN GIVEN NEW LEGAL POWERS TO MONITOR ITS USERS. THESE CAPABILITIES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY TARGETED TOWARD TERRORISM SUSPECTS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED USING THE INTERNET FOR COMMUNICATION, PROPAGANDA, RESEARCH, PLANNING, PUBLICITY, FUNDRAISING AND CREATING A DISTRIBUTED SENSE OF COMMUNITY. POLICING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY PRE-EMPTIVE, WITH A RANGE OF ACTIVITIES CRIMINALIZED AS 'SUPPORTING' OR 'APOLOGIZING FOR' TERRORISM. THE PRIVACY AND NONDISCRIMINATION RIGHTS THAT ARE CORE TO THE EUROPEAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY THE INCREASED SURVEILLANCE AND PROFILING OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS. WE ARGUE THAT THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE NATURE IS PROBLEMATIC FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND WILL LEAD TO PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
695	SWEDISH MEASURES TO FIGHT THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 DIFFER FROM THE STRATEGIES USED IN OTHER COMPARABLE COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST TO THE LOCKDOWN APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN APPLIED IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE SWEDISH STRATEGY HAS BEEN BASED TO A SUBSTANTIAL EXTENT ON INDIVIDUALS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY UNDER NON-BINDING RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS CONTRIBUTION EXPLORES THE SWEDISH STRATEGY FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PERSPECTIVE, HIGHLIGHTING THE TENSION BETWEEN THE FORMALIST SYSTEM FOR DELEGATING NORMS UNDER THE SWEDISH CONSTITUTION AND THE PRAGMATIC USE OF NON-BINDING RULES SUCH AS THE "GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS" ADOPTED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE OFFICIAL USE OF SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS IS CONFUSING FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, BECAUSE NON-BINDING RULES DO NOT OFFER THE TRADITIONAL FORMAL MECHANISMS FOR LEGAL PROTECTION, THE PUBLICATION OF NORMS OR ACCOUNTABILITY. THE LEGAL-REALIST APPROACH OF THE SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT'S CASE LAW, HOWEVER, HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BALANCING SOME OF THE UNFORTUNATE EFFECTS ARISING FROM THE SWEDISH COMBINATION OF FORMALISM AND PRAGMATISM.
696	THE DRAMATIC RISE OF CHARITABLE CROWDFUNDING HAS CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF FUNDRAISING AND GIVING. LITTLE EMPIRICAL WORK, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DONE TO EXPLORE CRITICAL FACTORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL CHARITABLE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS RUN BOTH BY FORMAL CHARITIES AND NON-CHARITIES. TO ADVANCE THE LITERATURE ON DONATION-BASED CHARITABLE CROWDFUNDING, WE DRAW ON A UNIQUE DATASET OF 427 COVID-19 CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS IN CHINA, EXAMINING WHETHER AND HOW EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL QUALITY SIGNALS ARE RELATED TO CROWDFUNDING SUCCESS MEASURED BY TOTAL DONATION AMOUNT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT CROWDFUNDING SUCCESS IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNAL SIGNALS (UPDATES AND PREDEFINED DURATION), WHEREAS THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL SIGNALS (PLATFORM AND AWARD) IS LESS CERTAIN. WHILE WE FIND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AWARD INFORMATION AND FUNDING SUCCESS, INFORMAL CAMPAIGNS USING AN ALTERNATIVE MEDIUM SEEM TO GENERATE MORE DONATIONS THAN FORMAL CAMPAIGNS USING AUTHORIZED PLATFORMS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STUDY FOR THEORY, PRACTICE AND POLICY ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
697	LOOKING CLOSELY AT EVERYDAY PRACTICES WITHIN MARKETPLACES SUCH AS THE MAKOLA MARKET IN GHANA'S CAPITAL ACCRA BRINGS TO THE FORE THE VERY DIVERSITY OF ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN ORDERIMPLEMENTATION IN THIS PARTICULAR SOCIAL SPACE. ALL OF THESE ACTORS DRAW ON MULTIPLE CONCEPTIONS OF ORDER AND CREATIVELY RECOMBINE ITS VARIOUS ELEMENTS AND SIGNIFICATIONS INTO EVER- NEW CONTEXTS. OUR JOINT ARTICLE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF ORDER IN MAKOLA TAKES THE PERSPECTIVE OF TWO KEY, ORDERING ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS IN THIS MARKET - TRADERS ASSOCIATIONS AND POLICE FORCES - AND ANALYSES THE MANIFOLD AND MUTUALLY ENTANGLED CONCEPTIONS OF ORDER ON WHICH THESE ACTORS DRAW IN THEIR PURSUIT TO LEGITIMISE THEIR OWN AND OTHERS' ACTIONS. POLICE OFFICERS MAY NOT REPRESENT THE STATE BUT ACT IN THE LIGHT OF BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHEREAS MARKET ASSOCIATIONS FOLLOW MANY MORE RATIONALITIES APART FROM THEIR MEMBERS' ECONOMIC GAINS. THEY PERCEIVE THEMSELVES AS A MARKET FAMILY, AND ENACT PARTICULAR REALMS OF STATENESS; FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN ASSISTING WITH TAX COLLECTION. BASED ON OUR ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK, IN WHICH EACH RESEARCHER INDEPENDENTLY FOCUSED ON PARTICULAR ACTOR GROUPS IN THE MARKET, WE ANALYSE HOW THESE CONSTELLATIONS OF ACTORS AND THEIR PARTICULAR CONCEPTIONS OF ORDER PLAY OUT IN EVERYDAY PRACTICES AND INTERACTIONS.
698	IN RECENT YEARS, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INNOVATE THE SYSTEM FOR SOCIAL ORGANIZATION MANAGEMENT PROPITIOUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, BUT SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOUBLE-EDGED, WHICH CAN BOTH ALLEVIATE THE SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PRESSURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CHALLENGE THEIR AUTHORITY. THEREFORE, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY OF DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL FOR MANAGING SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE THEORY OF DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL IS AN IMPORTANT PARADIGM FOR EXPLAINING THE GOVERNMENT-SOCIETY RELATIONSHIP IN CHINA, AS IT PROVIDES A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' BEHAVIORAL LOGIC OF DEVELOPING SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' SPECIFIC APPLICATION AND CHANGE OF THE STRATEGY ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL STILL NEED TO BE FURTHER EXPLORED. BASED ON THE ABOVE OBSERVATION, BY COLLECTING THE PANEL DATA OF 312 PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITIES OF CHINA IN 2008-2014, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ON THE WHOLE, HAVE ADOPTED THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF "DEVELOPING QUANTITY AND RESTRAINING CAPABILITY." THEY GIVE PRIORITY TO DEVELOPING SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL SERVICE, BUT IMPLEMENT STRICT CONTROL OVER ENVIRONMENTAL, LEGAL, AND INTERNATIONAL FOREIGN-RELATED ORGANIZATIONS AFFECTING THE REALIZATION OF ECONOMIC GOALS OR POLITICAL STABILITY. WITH A MORE DEVELOPED ECONOMY AND BETTER FISCAL REVENUES, A MORE LENIENT ENVIRONMENT IS GIVEN TO SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE MORE DEVELOPED. BUT THE CONTROL OVER ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS DOES NOT CHANGE WITH THE CHANGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR FISCAL REVENUES. THIS STUDY NOT ONLY EXPANDS THE THEORY OF DIFFERENTIAL CONTROL AND PROVIDES A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, BUT ALSO REVEALS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' BEHAVIORAL LOGIC OF DEVELOPING SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH ALSO PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' BEHAVIORS IN DEVELOPING SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.
699	THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES AND VALUES HAS A GREATER POTENTIAL THAN HAS BEEN RECOGNISED HITHERTO. FIRST, THE ADOPTION AT COMMON LAW OF THE PROPORTIONALITY TEST OF INTERFERENCES WITH RIGHTS SHOWS THAT, WHEN HUMAN RIGHTS ARE AT ISSUE, THE COURTS WILL APPLY AN EXIGENT TEST, ALLOWING INTERFERENCES ONLY IF, AMONGST OTHER THINGS, A LESS INTRUSIVE MEASURE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN USED. SECONDLY, THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, ALONG WITH COMMON LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM AS DEVELOPED RECENTLY BY THE SUPREME COURT, NOW MEANS THAT THERE IS A COMMON LAW PENDANT TO THE RULE IN S. 3(1) OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998. THIRDLY, IN CASES WHERE THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE ACT IS DISPLACED BY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THERE IS NO DISPLACEMENT OF COMMON LAW RIGHTS, WHICH CONTINUE TO OPERATE. FOURTHLY, COMMON LAW RIGHTS ARE MORE OPEN TO THE INFLUENCES OF THE CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAN ARE CONVENTION RIGHTS. THESE FACTORS COMBINE TO MEAN THAT THE FUTURE OF COMMON LAW RIGHTS IS AN AUSPICIOUS ONE.
700	THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAD TO FLEE THEIR HOMES WHEN CYCLONE IDAI HIT MOZAMBIQUE IN 2019. IN ITS AFTERMATH, THE GOVERNMENT RESETTLED MORE THAN 80,000 PEOPLE FROM HIGH-RISK AREAS TO SAFER GROUND. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES RESETTLEMENT AS A DURABLE SOLUTION TO DISASTER RESPONSE. THE QUESTION OF DURABLE RESETTLEMENT DUE TO CLIMATE-RELATED DISPLACEMENT IS ESPECIALLY PERTINENT IN THE LIGHT OF ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE. BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, WE SHOW THAT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDED IN PROVIDING A SHORT-TERM RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER, THERE ARE TWO MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO USING RESETTLEMENT AS A DURABLE SOLUTION: THE LACK OF CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS LEADING TO RESETTLEMENT; AND THE GAP BETWEEN THE SHORT-TERM HUMANITARIAN PERSPECTIVE AND A LONGER-TERM DEVELOPMENT VIEWPOINT. RESETTLEMENT CAN HARDLY BE SEEN AS A DURABLE SOLUTION TO CLIMATE-RELATED DISPLACEMENT AS LONG AS KEY PRINCIPLES ARE NOT RESPECTED.
701	MOROCCO'S COMPETITION COUNCIL HAS UNDERGONE MAJOR REFORM SINCE 2011. NEW LEGISLATION HAS ELEVATED THE COUNCIL FROM ITS FORMER ROLE AS A CONSULTATIVE AUTHORITY TO AN INDEPENDENT, FINANCIALLY AUTONOMOUS, DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY. DESPITE THESE CHANGES, HOWEVER, MANY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH REGARD TO THE COUNCIL'S INDEPENDENCE, AND ITS DUTY TO MONITOR AND ENFORCE FREE AND FAIR COMPETITION, AS WELL AS THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE GUARANTEES CONCERNING THE STATUTORY IMPARTIALITY AND POWERS THAT ENABLE THE COUNCIL TO FULFIL ITS MANDATE INDEPENDENTLY. THE COUNCIL'S INDEPENDENCE MERITS DISCUSSION IN THE DEBATE ON THE OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPETITION AUTHORITY, AS IT IS RELEVANT TO GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. TO REGULATE COMPETITION EFFECTIVELY, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMPETITION REGULATOR REMAINS INDEPENDENT. HOWEVER, WITHIN A DEMOCRATIC FRAMEWORK, THE COUNCIL'S INDEPENDENCE MUST BE BALANCED BY PARLIAMENTARY ACCOUNTABILITY AND BUDGETARY CONTROL.
702	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE ON FDI INFLOWS ON A SAMPLE OF 32 AFRICAN COUNTRIES: 15 LOW INCOME COUNTRIES AND 17 MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES, OVER THE PERIOD OF 1996-2019. OUR EMPIRICAL STUDY USED BOTH AGGREGATED ANALYSIS AND THE SYSTEM GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (SYSTEM-GMM). THE AGGREGATE APPROACH CONSISTS TO USE THREE COMPOSITE INDICATORS [POLITICAL GOVERNANCE ENCOMPASSING POLITICAL STABILITY (PS) AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (VA)], ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE [REPRESENTING BY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (GE) AND REGULATORY QUALITY (RQ)] AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE [INCLUDING THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (CC), THE RULE OF LAW (RL)]. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT OVERALL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ATTRACT FDI INFLOWS IN AFRICAN AND ITS SUB-REGIONS. THEREFORE, IMPROVEMENTS IN POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE ARE DETERMINISTIC CONDITIONS IN THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF FDI IN AFRICAN ECONOMIES.
703	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUICIDE RATES AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY USED AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG MODEL AND ERROR CORRECTION MODEL TO EXAMINE SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIPS DURING 1996-2017 IN LEBANON. FINDINGS THE STUDY SHOWS THAT IN THE LONG-RUN, SUICIDE RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED TO THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW, BUT NOT TO REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY. IN THE SHORT-RUN, NEARLY ALL VARIABLES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAVE A NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP TO SUICIDE RATES. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS RESEARCH IS THE FIRST TO INSPECT THE RELATION BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND SUICIDE RATES. EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ADD NEW EVIDENCE TO THE LITERATURE AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO POLICYMAKERS.
704	A GREAT DEAL OF INK HAS BEEN SPILLED OVER ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. SURPRISINGLY, THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL EQUITY ON TRUST IN GOVERNMENT HAS RECEIVED RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION. PARTICULARLY, INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO EMPIRICALLY CONNECT THE LINKAGE BETWEEN A COUNTRY-LEVEL SOCIAL EQUITY AND AN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF SOCIAL EQUITY ON CITIZEN TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. THIS STUDY USES A MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MACRO-COUNTRY LEVEL SOCIAL EQUITY. THE FINDINGS FROM ANALYZING THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY AND THE RULE OF LAW INDEX REVEAL THAT SOCIAL EQUITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH TRUST IN THE COURTS AND THE POLICE. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO CONSIDER SOCIAL EQUITY IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF DEVELOPING CITIZEN TRUST IN GOVERNMENT.
705	FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS TO EMERGING NATIONS EXHIBIT A BIG VARIATION. TO WHAT EXTENT DO HOST-COUNTRY REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ATTRACT OR REPEL FDI? WE INTEGRATE VARIOUS THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES: TRANSACTION COST ECONOMICS, GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS AND LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF FORMAL REGULATIONS, RULE-OF-LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS, PROCEDURAL BOTTLENECKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF AN EMERGING MARKET OVER A 12 YEAR PERIOD. WE SEEK TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THE MANY REGULATORY VARIABLES MOST INFLUENCE THE FDI DECISION. WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH MORE EFFICIENT START-UP REGULATIONS, STRONGER PROTECTION OF MINORITY INVESTMENT, AND BETTER PROCEDURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACROSS THEIR BORDERS ATTRACT MORE FDI. THESE RESULTS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT POLICY REFORM IN EMERGING MARKETS, AS WELL AS FOR MULTINATIONALS SELECTING WHICH NATIONS TO INVEST IN.
706	THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT DECENTRALISATION AND SOCIAL COHESION IN RELIGIOUSLY HETEROGENEOUS COMMUNITIES IN TIMES OF POLITICAL TRANSITION. POST-MUBARAK EGYPT IS TAKEN AS A CASE STUDY INVOLVING THE INFORMAL DEVOLUTION OF POWER IN MANAGING SECTARIAN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MAJORITY MUSLIM AND MINORITY CHRISTIAN POPULATIONS BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2011 AND JUNE 2012. ON THE SURFACE, THE PROCESS HAD FEATURES OF A POLITICAL DECENTRALISATION OF POWER WHICH HOLDS PROMISE OF DOWNWARD ACCOUNTABILITY. THE SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF) DELEGATED THE GOVERNANCE OF LOCAL SECTARIAN CONFLICT TO RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY LEADERS ENJOYING HIGH POPULARITY, A POLICY THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD-LED GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THE PROCESS OF LOCAL LEADERS ASSUMING THE POWER TO GOVERN WAS ALSO AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THE COLLAPSE OF RULE OF LAW IN A CONTEXT OF EXTREME POLITICAL VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTRY IN REVOLT.
707	AFTER A DECADE OF REMARKABLE GROWTH RATES, THE REGION OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE WAS SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE EURO AREA FISCAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES. THE DECREASED INTERNATIONAL INTEREST IN THIS REGION DOES NOT DEPEND ENTIRELY ON THE LACK OF GLOBAL FINANCES, RATHER ON THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OF THESE SMALL ECONOMIES. THE ANSWER TO THIS VICIOUS CYCLE OF ECONOMIC RECESSION, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND POVERTY LIES IN A NEW GROWTH MODEL BASED ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABLE, INCLUSIVE, AND SMART GROWTH. WITH A STRONG POLITICAL WILL OF ALL PARTIES, THE NEXT 10 YEARS CAN BRING ABOUT A FREE REGIONAL ECONOMY, AN INTEROPERABLE NEW ECONOMIC REALITY THAT WOULD PROJECT COLLECTIVE FINANCIAL STABILITY, ATTRACT "QUALITATIVE" FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, RAISE COMPETITIVENESS AND SUPPORT INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIES FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC RULE OF LAW, AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS ARE IMPERATIVE FOR ACHIEVING THESE CHALLENGING OBJECTIVES.
708	POLICING IN CHINA HAS UNDERGONE TREMENDOUS CHANGE DURING THE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE PAST THREE DECADES. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PLURAL POLICING BODIES THAT HAVE EXISTED DURING PRE- AND POST-REFORM PERIODS IN CHINA. IN THE PRE-REFORM PERIOD THE POLICING BODIES WERE GENERALLY PUBLIC IN NATURE WITH THE PUBLIC SECURITY POLICE PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE TO THE OTHER POLICING BODIES. IN THE POST-REFORM PERIOD, THERE HAS BEEN A TRANSITION FROM A MONOPOLY OF PUBLIC POLICING TO AN INTEGRATION OF PUBLIC/PRIVATE POLICING, WITH THE PUBLIC SECURITY POLICE STILL PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN THE POLICING NETWORK. APART FROM THE EMERGENCE OF PRIVATE POLICING (THE SECURITY SERVICE INDUSTRY), THERE IS ALSO A TREND TOWARDS PRIVATIZING SOME PREVIOUSLY PUBLIC POLICING BODIES IN LINE WITH THE MOVEMENT TOWARD STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND TOWARDS PRIVATIZATION IN GENERAL.
709	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE OF CHINESE LAWYERS, THEIR PROFESSIONAL TROUBLES, AND THEIR COPING STRATEGIES TO BUILD ON AND DEVELOP THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL EMBEDDEDNESS. DATA FROM A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND 25-CITY SURVEY SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL EMBEDDEDNESS, DEFINED BROADLY AS BUREAUCRATIC, INSTRUMENTAL, OR AFFECTIVE TIES TO THE STATE AND ITS ACTORS, HELPS CHINESE LAWYERS SURVIVE THEIR EVERYDAY DIFFICULTIES, SUCH AS ROUTINE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERFERENCE, OFFICIAL RENT SEEKING, AND POLICE HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION. THE ARTICLE DRAWS THE IRONIC CONCLUSION THAT LEGAL PRACTICE IN CHINA REVEALS AT LEAST AS MUCH ABOUT THE ENDURING SALIENCE OF SOCIALIST INSTITUTIONS AS IT DOES ABOUT INCIPIENT CAPITALIST AND "RULE OF LAW" INSTITUTIONS. LAWYERS' DEPENDENCE ON STATE ACTORS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM PRESERVES THE VALUE OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS INSIDE THE VERY INSTITUTIONS THAT SOME SOCIOLOGISTS HAVE ARGUED ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBVIATING THE NEED FOR SUCH GUANXI.
710	FOCUSING ON THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS FOR DEFUSING VARIOUS SOCIAL DISTURBANCES AND COLLECTIVE INCIDENTS DURING THE REFORM PERIOD AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST DECADE, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED PRAGMATIC AND PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACHES TO DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING VARIOUS MECHANISMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO THE COMPLICATED AND CHALLENGING SITUATION OF STEADILY INCREASING AND INTENSIFYING SOCIAL CONTENTION. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT NEITHER LITIGATION NOR NON-LITIGATION MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION CAN EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE SOCIAL CONFLICTS. IN LIGHT OF THIS DIFFICULTY, VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MEET SOCIAL NEEDS AND MANAGE SOCIAL CRISES WHILE BALANCING STATE POWER AND SOCIAL SELF-GOVERNANCE. WE CALL SUCH EXPERIMENTS "DIVERSIFIED MECHANISMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION (DMDR)." THIS STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON THE SHIFT FROM AN EMPHASIS ON THE EARLIER NON-LITIGATION APPROACH TO A MORE DIVERSIFIED WAY OF ADDRESSING COLLECTIVE DISPUTES IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA.
711	SINCE THE BIRTH OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THE DISCUSSION OF THE LEGITIMACY OF ITS APPLICATION TO JUDICIAL SCENARIOS HAS NEVER STOPPED. THE DOMESTIC ACADEMIC CIRCLES QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DECISION-MAKING MAINLY EMBODIES FOUR ASPECTS: THE JUDGE'S SUBJECTIVITY CRISIS, THE POWER LEGITIMACY CRISIS, THE IMPUTATION DIFFICULTY CRISIS, AND THE DAMAGE TO THE JUSTICE REALIZATION CRISIS. THEREFORE, IT IS URGENT TO CLARIFY THE LEGAL LOGIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING AND CLARIFY ITS DECISION-MAKING LIMITS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROVE THE LEGALITY OF INTELLIGENT JUDICIAL OPERATION SIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE FOUR-DIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE'S INTERVENTION IN JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING, SUCH AS THE JUDGE'S SUBJECTIVITY, THE LEGITIMACY OF POWER, THE ATTRIBUTION OF FAULT, AND THE REALIZATION OF JUSTICE, WITH A VIEW TO THE SUBJECT, POWER, RESPONSIBILITY, JUSTICE, FOUR ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNANCE OF CHINA'S INTELLIGENT JUDICIARY TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS.
712	WHILE THE DOBBS DECISION WAS A WELCOME ONE FOR MANY, IT WAS NOT SO FOR OTHERS, DEALING AS IT DOES WITH ABORTION, ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES OF AN INCREASINGLY DIVIDED AMERICA. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE DOBBS DECISION IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER DIVISIVE LEGAL DECISIONS IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THE DOBBS DECISION HAS SOME GREAT BENEFITS: IT NOW FORCES THOSE WHO WISH TO DEFEND OR EXPAND ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE TO DO SO VIA THE LEGAL PROCESS (WHICH WILL BE HARDER FOR THEM TO DO), AND SHOULD ALSO STRENGTHEN RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION IN OUR COUNTRY OVERALL. ALL OF THIS IS CONTINGENT ON PEOPLE CHOOSING TO MAINTAIN CIVILITY WHILE MOVING FORWARD IN A POST -DOBBS AMERICA, OF COURSE, WHICH IS BY NO MEANS GUARANTEED.
713	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE OPERATIONAL LOGIC OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW, IN PART, IS TO TAME STATES BY LEGALLY REQUIRING THAT THEY BEHAVE AS IF THEY WERE PROFIT-SEEKING ENTERPRISES. THIS IS SUGGESTED BY A SMALL SET OF AWARDS, ARISING OUT OF CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES, THAT WORK A BINARY BETWEEN NORMAL CONTRACTUAL BEHAVIOUR AND SOVEREIGN ACTS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY BEHAVIOUR. NON-CONTRACTUAL BEHAVIOUR IS DEEMED 'POLITICAL' AND LIKELY TO GIVE RISE TO LIABILITY UNDER INVESTMENT LAW STRICTURES. THIS COMPLEMENTS WELL HAYEK'S APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW, WHERE, OUTSIDE OF THEIR 'FRAMEWORK' FUNCTIONS, STATES ARE EXPECTED TO BEHAVE 'IN THE SAME MANNER AS ANY PRIVATE PERSON'. IN AN AGE OF EVER-INCREASING DISPARITY, THIS RENDERS IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR STATES AND CITIZENS TO TAKE UP MEASURES THAT POLANYI ASSOCIATES WITH THE PROTECTIVE COUNTER MOVEMENTS, SHIELDING CITIZENS FROM THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF FREE MARKETS.
714	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATED HOW THE POLITICAL LIBERALISM OF JOHN RAWLS CAN OFFER REASONABLE ARGUMENTS TO ADDRESS THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DILEMMAS CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ALTHOUGH RAWLS' THEORY APPLIES SPECIFICALLY TO WELL-ORDERED SOCIETIES, IN & SECT;& SECT; 10 AND 11 OF CONFERENCE VIII OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM, THE PHILOSOPHER DISCUSSES HOW TO GOVERN IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY THAT AFFECT STABILITY INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. FROM THE DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE TYPES OF INSTITUTIONAL INSTABILITY (CRISIS AND APPREHENSION), IT IS INDICATED THAT THE SITUATION GENERATED BY COVID-19 IS SIMILAR TO THE CONTEXT OF TENSION. USING JOHN RAWLS' POLITICAL LIBERALISM IN THIS CONTEXT OF TENSION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO AFFIRM THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF RESTRICTING THE FREEDOM TO GO AND THE ENTREPRENEUR, IN FAVOR OF NOT EXPOSING PEOPLE TO EXCESSIVE RISKS OF DEATH.
715	CAN A SOCIETY SUFFERING CONTESTS BETWEEN RICH AND POOR ACHIEVE GOOD GOVERNANCE IN THE FACE OF ENDEMIC CORRUPTION? WE EXAMINE A STYLIZED POOR STATE WITH WEAK INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH A "CULTURE OF EVASION" DAMAGES STATE AUTHORITY. MANY EVADE TAX PAYMENTS, LIMITING THE STATE'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY. IN THE FACE OF EXTENSIVE CORRUPTION, IT IS CHALLENGING FOR THE STATE TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES REFLECTING GOOD GOVERNANCE: FOR EXAMPLE, A GOVERNMENT THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE AND TRANSPARENT, EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE, AND FOLLOWS THE RULE OF LAW. THE RICH AND POOR POSSESS DIFFERENT VIEWS ON WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ENFORCING PROPER PAYMENTS OF TAXES DUE. THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DESIGN AN EFFECTIVE TAX ADMINISTRATION POLICY THAT MINIMIZES CORRUPTION AND IS SENSITIVE TO THE PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS OF SOCIETY. TO DO THIS, IT MUST UNDERSTAND WHAT DRIVES SUCH WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION.
716	BEGINNING IN THE 1990S, A NUMBER OF ELITE CHINESE INTELLECTUALS DEVELOPED NEW CRITIQUES OF LIBERALISM. WITHIN THE ORBIT OF MARXISM, A GROUP OFTEN CALLED THE "NEW LEFT" MAINLY CONCENTRATED ON ECONOMIC LIBERALISM AND INEQUALITIES OF WEALTH. SOME OF THEM ALSO SHOWED AN AFFINITY WITH THE VIEWS OF INTELLECTUALS REFERRED TO AS STATISTS. THE STATISTS' THREE MAIN IDEAS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS THE SUPERIORITY OF POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE RULE OF LAW, A CRITIQUE OF THE "JUDICIALIZATION" OF POLITICS AND THE NEED TO "REPOLITICIZE" THE STATE, AND A CRITIQUE OF UNIVERSALISM AND AN ASSERTION OF CHINESE EXCEPTIONALISM. SOME OF THE LEGAL SCHOLARS WHO DEVELOPED THESE IDEAS ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY CARL SCHMITT (1888-1985), AN AUTHORITARIAN GERMAN LEGAL SCHOLAR AND POLITICAL THEORIST. IMPORTANT TEXTS BY THE CURRENT CHINESE GROUP OF STATIST THINKERS PROVIDE AN INTELLECTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE RECENT EVOLUTION IN PARTY IDEOLOGY.
717	THE RAPID DEVELOPMENTS OF RESEARCH AND TEACHING OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN CHINA HAVE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ACADEMICS OF THE WORLD, WHO HAVE LOOKED OVER THE LANDSCAPE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN CHINA WITH GREAT INTEREST. UNFORTUNATELY, EXISTING LITERATURE HAS YET TO COMPLETELY SATISFY THEIR INTERESTS IN THIS ASPECT. THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS GAP BY INTRODUCING REPRESENTATIVE INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS, PUBLICATIONS, ACADEMIC ASSOCIATIONS AND RESEARCH FUNDING SCHEMES ON INTERNATIONAL LAW IN CHINA. MORE CONCRETELY, THIS PAPER WILL SHOW THE MAINSTREAM RESEARCH SOURCES OF THEIR CHINESE COUNTERPARTS AS WELL AS EMBRACE TEACHING AS PART OF THE RESEARCH SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN CHINA. IT IS EXPECTED THAT, WITH THEIR MORE ATTENTION INTO THE HOLISTIC RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND THE "ONE BELT, ONE ROAD" STRATEGY, THE CHINESE ACADEMIA OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WILL CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
718	THE VICTOR IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS THE BILLIONAIRE ENTREPRENEUR ANDREI BABI, WHO NOW WIELDS HUGE INFLUENCE OVER THE ECONOMY, THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL ARENA. HOWEVER, THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT TO THAT IN POLAND OR HUNGARY. THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES, PARTICULARLY ON THE LEFT, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED, AND THE PARTY SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY FRAGMENTED. YET THE DIVISION OF POWER REMAINS INTACT. BABI DOES NOT HAVE AN IDEOLOGICAL PROGRAMME, AND HAS NOT PROMISED SYSTEM CHANGE. THE ANO PARTY WHICH HE FOUNDED AND NOW LEADS ALSO HAS NO MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT, AND NO COALITION PARTNER. WHETHER OR NOT A GRADUAL EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL OCCUR UNDER PRIME MINISTER BABI, AGAINST WHOM CHARGES OF SUBSIDY FRAUD HAVE BEEN FILED, ALSO DEPENDS ON THE RESULT OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN JANUARY 2018.
719	THE LAST YEAR THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF 1910 WAS 100 YEARS, THAT FACT IS DECISIVE TO HISTORIC BASES OF RULE OF LAW IN COLOMBIA. THAT REFORM IS PILLAR OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH WASN'T STUDIED BY THE ACADEMY. THE NEXT ESSAY REBUILDS THE POLITIC AND LEGAL EFFECTS OF THE REPUBLICANISM PROJECT SUGGESTED BY THE PRESIDENT CARLOS E. RESTREPO (1910-1914). THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES, THE HISTORIC CONTEXT, THE POLITIC IMPACT, AND THE SOCIAL PROCESSES THAT SUPPORTED THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL IN THE XX CENTURY IN OUR COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE PRINCIPALS PRECEDENTS, DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEFINITIONS OF POLITIC PROJECT KNOWN HOW OF THE REPUBLICANISM, THE PROBLEMS, FOR EXAMPLE THE DILEMMAS THAT SUCH HAD, CONFILCTS, POLEMICS, CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN ELITES, THE ONE THOUSAND DAYS WAR (1899-1902) AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT HAD OF THE FIVE YEARS OF REYES GOVERMENT.
720	DRAWING ON THE INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE, SEVERAL SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES THAT FACILITATE THE EFFICIENT EXERCISE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN ATTRACTING HIGHER LEVELS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THIS ARGUMENT BY EXPLOITING COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA ON THE INSTITUTIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. USING THE SYSTEM-GMM ESTIMATION APPROACH AND A LARGE SAMPLE OF PANEL DATA THAT SPANS 19 YEARS OF OBSERVATIONS FROM 127 COUNTRIES, WE FIND EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INCREASES IN COUNTRIES WITH INSTITUTIONS THAT ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW, EXPAND TRADE FREEDOMS, AND REDUCE REGULATORY BARRIERS TO INVESTING AND DOING BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THESE EFFECTS APPEAR TO BE WEAKER IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTROLS FOR ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION. (C) 2022 ECONOMIC SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA, QUEENSLAND.

721	EVEN WHEN NPM (NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT) WAS NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT APPLYING SYSTEMATICALLY PERFOR-MANCE DRIVEN MARKET-TYPE-MECHANISMS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR WAS NOT REALLY MATCHING ITS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FRAMED SYSTEM. ALSO, OUR FUTURE SOCIETY AND PUBLIC SECTOR WILL NEED A COMBINED EFFORT TO ENSURE AN IN-CLUSIVE SERVICE DELIVERY, EFFECTIVE CRISES GOVERNANCE, AND FUNCTIONAL INNOVATION. THIS WILL NOT BE FEASIBLE WITH A PURE MARKET DRIVEN NPM, NOR WITH A PURE NET-WORK DRIVEN NPG (NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE). THIS CONTRIBUTION STATES THAT A NEO-WEBERIAN-STATE MODEL HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE POTENTIAL TO DELIVER AND EN-SURE REALIZING THE CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE, FOLLOWING TO THE RULE-OF-LAW, IN A DEMOCRATIC AND INCLUSIVE WAY, FROM A 'WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT' (WOG) PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN A 'WHOLE OF SOCIETY' (WOS) CONTEXT.
722	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE CONVENIENT EXCUSE OF (IL)LEGALITY USED BY (1) RELIGIOUS MAJORITARIAN MOBS TO JUSTIFY ATTACKS AGAINST PLACES OF WORSHIP AND RELIGIOUS BUILDINGS OF MINORITIES; AND (2) POLICE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ABSOLVE THEMSELVES OF THE FAILURE TO UPHOLD PUBLIC ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW, PROTECT RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, AND TO PUNISH RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE EMERGENCE OF LEGAL VIOLENCE IN THE FORM OF ANTI-MOSQUE VIGILANTE EXTREMISM IN MYANMAR FROM 2012 ONWARDS AND ANALYZES CASES OF ATTACKS AGAINST: (1) "ILLEGAL" MOSQUES; (2) MADRASAS BEING USED AS OR RECONSTRUCTED INTO MOSQUES; (3) BUILDINGS ALLEGEDLY BEING CONSTRUCTED AS MOSQUES; (4) PRIVATE HOMES AND PUBLIC SPACES BEING USED AS MOSQUES; AND CASES OF (5) CLOSED MOSQUES NOT BEING ALLOWED TO REOPEN. THE AUTHOR PRIMARILY USED MYANMAR-LANGUAGE RESOURCES AS WELL AS INTERVIEWS TO CONDUCT THE RESEARCH.
723	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT BETTER GOVERNANCE PRACTICES CAN REDUCE THE COSTS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION. OUR SAMPLE COVERS 100 HIGH-, MIDDLE- AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES DURING 1996 TO 2015. USING PANEL REGRESSIONS ACCOUNTING FOR ENDOGENEITY AND CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDANCE, WE FIND THAT NET INTEREST MARGINS OF BANKS ARE LOWER IF VARIOUS GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE BETTER. GOVERNANCE INDICATORS RANGE FROM COMPREHENSIVE INDICES ON THE RULE OF LAW TO MORE NARROW INDICATORS LIKE ETHICS OF PRIVATE FIRMS. THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS SEEMS NOT TO HAVE HAD A STRONG IMPACT EXCEPT VIA CREDIT RISK. FINALLY, WE ESTIMATE THAT POTENTIAL ANNUAL SAVINGS FROM LOWER NET INTEREST MARGINS COULD AVERAGE ALMOST 0,3 PERCENT OF GDP, HAD THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS BEEN AT THE TOP DECILE. THESE SIMULATIONS LEND CREDENCE TO THE INTUITION THAT BETTER GOVERNANCE PRACTICES SHOULD REDUCE COSTS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY.
724	THE STUDY ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE SCOPE OF ASSESSMENT IS BROADENED BY ALLOWING THE IMPACT OF DECENTRALIZATION ON GROWTH TO DEPEND ON NATION'S QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY. THE STUDY USES A PANEL DATASET OF 53 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD OF 1996-2014. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE IMPACT OF DECENTRALIZATION ON PER CAPITA GDP GROWTH RATE IS POSITIVE WHEN IT IS SUPPORTED BY STABLE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN TERMS OF STABILITY IN PRICES, BUDGET DEFICIT AND EXCHANGE RATE. FURTHER, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IS GROWTH ENHANCING WHEN IT IS COMPLEMENTED BY SOUND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF LOW CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, RULE OF LAW, HIGH BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. HENCE, DECENTRALIZATION CAN BECOME GROWTH ENHANCING IF MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS SURPASS A CRITICAL LEVEL.
725	NATIONAL INJUSTICE HAS BEEN LINKED TO LOWER NATIONAL HAPPINESS. WE PREDICT THAT NATIONAL RELIGIOSITY WILL MITIGATE THIS NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF INJUSTICE ON HAPPINESS. WE TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS ANALYZING NATIONAL-LEVEL DATA FROM 121 NATIONS, USING A SINGLE-LEVEL MODERATED REGRESSION ANALYSIS. TO CAPTURE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF NATIONAL INJUSTICE, WE COMBINE FOUR NATIONAL MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH INJUSTICE, NAMELY: INDEXES OF GROUP GRIEVANCES, POLITICAL TERROR, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT NATIONAL RELIGIOSITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT MODERATING EFFECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INJUSTICE AND HAPPINESS, SUCH THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOSITY MITIGATE MORE OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INJUSTICE ON HAPPINESS THAN LOWER LEVELS DO. THE RESULTS HOLD WHEN RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND INDEXES OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, EDUCATION, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ARE CONTROLLED FOR. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PEOPLE IN RELIGIOUS CULTURES MAY SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZE RELIGIOUS FAITH TO DEAL WITH ADVERSE CONDITIONS.
726	KLAUS GUNTHER'S DISCOURSE THEORY OF LAW LINKS THE CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE LEGITIMACY OF DEMOCRATIC LAW. BECAUSE ATTRIBUTIONS OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY ARE ALWAYS AIMED AT A PERSON, THEY CONTAIN AN IMPLICIT CONCEPTION OF THE PERSON. IN A DEMOCRACY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, GUNTHER ARGUES, THIS CONCEPTION OF A PERSON MUST BE UNDERSTOOD, AS A "DELIBERATIVE PERSON", A FREE AND AUTONOMOUS PERSON CAPABLE OF BEING BOTH THE ADDRESSEE AND THE AUTHOR OF LEGAL NORMS. THE "DELIBERATIVE PERSON" IS THE CONCEPTUAL CORE OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY, YET GUNTHER DEVELOPS IT USING A CONCEPT OF "COMMUNICATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY" MODELED ON THE CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT IT IS DESIGNED TO EXPLICATE. MY AIM IS TO BRING THIS CIRCULAR GROUNDING OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY INTO VIEW AND ARGUE THAT GUNTHER'S DISCOURSE THEORY OF LAW IS BASED ON A LEGALIZED PICTURE OF DISCOURSE.
727	HOW DO PROPERTY RIGHTS BECOME SECURE? HOW DOES RULE OF LAW TAKE HOLD IN AN ECONOMY? THE AUTHOR USES AN ORIGINAL SURVEY OF 516 FIRMS IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, AS WELL AS INTERVIEW-BASED CASE STUDIES, TO REEXAMINE THESE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY. MOST STATES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD LACK THE REQUISITE TIME HORIZONS AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO MAKE THE CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS EMPHASIZED IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT FIRMS CAN ENFORCE THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHOUT RESORT TO MAFIAS BY FORMING ALLIANCES WITH STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS FOREIGN ACTORS, COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND LABOR. THESE STAKEHOLDERS CAN IMPOSE COSTS ON THE POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS THROUGH DIVERSE POLITICAL STRATEGIES, ALLOWING FIRMS TO DEFEND THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS NOT ONLY FROM PRIVATE PREDATORS BUT ALSO FROM THE STATE. THE ARTICLE EVALUATES THIS "BOTTOM-UP" THEORY OF SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS AGAINST EXISTING STATE-BASED THEORIZING.
728	IN HIS TALE OF THE STRUGGLES AND PRIVATIONS OF THE MINING COMMUNITY IN THE INDUSTRIAL SOUTH OF WALES IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, LEWIS JONES, EX-MINER AND SOCIALIST ACTIVIST, PUT ASIDE THE USUAL TOOLS OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM - OF ORATORY AND PAMPHLET PROPAGANDA - AND INSTEAD TURNED TO FICTION AS A MEANS OF EDUCATING AND MOBILISING THE POLITICAL ENERGY OF THE WORKFORCE. IN DOING SO, JONES REPRESENTED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE LAW WAS PIVOTAL TO THE SOCIAL ORGANISATION DELIVERING INJUSTICE TO WORKING PEOPLE. WHEN ONE TURNS TO HISTORY AND TO THE LEGAL RECORD, THE CONTESTABLE ACCOUNTS, ELISIONS AND ABSENCES FROM THE RECORD SPEAK ELOQUENTLY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH SELECTIVE DOCTRINE CONTRIBUTES TO THAT INJUSTICE. THE RESULTANT MESSAGE RESONATES WITH DEBATES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIETY, POLITICS AND THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF.
729	THE NATION'S RECENT EXPERIENCE WITH WAR AND ECONOMIC CRISIS WOULD HARDLYSHOCK THORSTEIN VEBLEN. AMERICA'S MOST ORIGINAL RADICAL VOICE, VEBLEN HAS MUCH TO TEACH US ABOUT THE COMMON PREDATORY ORIGINS OF WAR AND FINANCE AND THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PURSUIT. THIS BRIEF SURVEY OF THE CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF VEBLEN'S OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WAR AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE EMPHASIZES THE POLITICAL FOUNDATION OF HIS CRITICAL THEORY. THOUGH WIDELY REGARDED AS AN ECONOMIC THINKER, VEBLEN'S CRITIQUE OF MODERN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE AND ITS ALLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT RESTS ON AN ESSENTIALLY POLITICAL DISSECTION OF WHAT HE TERMED BARBARIC EXPLOIT, THE ANCIENT ROOT OF WAR, POWER POLITICS, THE STATE, AND LATTER DAY FINANCIAL CONQUEST. FOR VEBLEN, BARBARISM DID NOT END WITH THE COMING OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW OR CAPITALISM; ITS HABITS OF EXPLOIT, WASTE AND DESTRUCTION GO MARCHING ON.
730	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE QUESTION OF JUDICIAL AUTONOMY IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE. IT EXAMINES TO WHAT EXTENT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE KNESSET WERE INVOLVED IN THE PROCEDURE OF APPOINTING SUPREME COURT JUDGES, AND THEN DISCUSSES THE INVOLVEMENT OF THESE AUTHORITIES IN THE COURTS' ONGOING WORK. AN EXAMINATION OF THE FULL RANGE OF EVIDENCE FROM THE PERIOD LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT, SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ISRAEL, THERE WERE NO UNSUITABLE ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE JUDGES TO ISSUE UNFAIR RULINGS OR TO RESTRICT THEIR AUTONOMY IN OTHER WAYS. THE MISTAKEN NOTION THAT JUDGES IN THE EARLY YEARS OF ISRAEL WERE NOT RESPECTED OR APPRECIATED AND THAT THEIR AUTONOMY WAS IN PRACTICE FLAWED SHOULD THEREFORE BE ABANDONED, ACKNOWLEDGING THE EFFORTS OF THE FIRST ISRAELIS TO RECONCILE THE COMPLEX PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
731	AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PAPER IS INTERESTED IN SHOWING, FROM AN IUSPHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE PROBLEMS AND OBSTRUCTIONS OF CODIFICATION IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA IN THE POSTINDUSTRIAL AND "POSTMODERN" SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL ORDERS. IN THIS SENSE, THE INTEREST OF THIS ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE "CRISIS" OF CODIFICATION IN STATUTE-CENTERED COUNTRIES. A CRISIS RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF THE ALLIANCE STATE-SOCIETY FOR CONFORMING A NEW MODEL OF NEOCONSTITUTIONAL SOCIAL RULE OF LAW (STATE OF LAW) IN WHICH CODIFICATION FAILS ITS FUNDAMENTAL PRACTICAL FUNCTION OF REDUCING SOCIAL COMPLEXITY. THE NEXT STEP LEADS US TO THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECT INTEREST OF THIS PAPER, TO SHOW IN WHICH SENSE A NEW MODEL OF CODIFICATION IS POSSIBLE. IN THIS SENSE, I WILL PROPOSE A MODEL OF NEOCODIFICATION CENTERED IN A COMPREHENSIVE, PLURAL AND DYNAMIC CONCEPT OF LAW WHICH LEADS TO A NEOCODIFICATION OPENED AND "TO CONSTANT LAW".
732	THE WELFARE STATE LITERATURE HAS LARGELY IGNORED THE IMPACT OF A COUNTRY'S QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT ON ITS LEVELS OF REDISTRIBUTION. USING CROSS-SECTIONAL TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS OF TWENTY-ONE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT ENVIRONMENTS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION, RAMPANT BUREAUCRATIC INEFFICIENCY AND INEFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF REDISTRIBUTION. POOR GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE REDISTRIBUTION PROCESS BY HINDERING COUNTRIES' ABILITY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO REDISTRIBUTION AND DELIVER THEM TO THEIR BENEFICIARIES. CONTRARY TO EXISTING DEMAND-ORIENTED PERSPECTIVES, THE PROPOSED CAUSAL MECHANISM DOES NOT BLAME LOWER REDISTRIBUTION ON THE LACK OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE WELFARE STATE. RATHER, IT FOCUSES ON THE CAPACITY OF STATES TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT INEQUALITY-REDUCING POLICIES. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO NUMEROUS EXTENSIONS AND MODEL SPECIFICATIONS.
733	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EVERYDAY LEGALITY OF THE PREVENTIVE DETENTION REGIME IN KASHMIR AS A MEANS OF WAGING WAR AGAINST POLITICAL DISSIDENTS. WE FOLLOW THE CIRCULATION OF DETAINEES AND THEIR FILES ACROSS MULTIPLE LEGAL VENUES AND REGIMES TO SHOW HOW THE COUNTERINSURGENCY STATE REINSCRIBES SPECTACULAR AND TERRIFYING FORMS OF VIOLENCE THROUGH MODALITIES OF BANAL PAPERWORK AND ITERATIVE PERFORMANCES OF THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC AND TEXTUAL INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING POLICE DOSSIERS, DETENTION ORDERS, AND POLICE COMPLAINTS, WE ARGUE THAT THE PERMANENT EMERGENCY IN KASHMIR OPERATES THROUGH AN EVERYDAY HYPERLEGALITY OF INDEFINITE INCARCERATION THAT INTERMINGLES THE SYSTEMS, TECHNIQUES, AND JURISDICTIONS OF COLONIAL POLICING, BUREAUCRATIC PAPERWORK, AND MILITARY WARFARE. FURTHER, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THIS GRID OF INDEFINITE DETENTION MANIFESTS THROUGH A TEMPORALITY OF DEFERRAL AND DELAY THAT COMES TO CHARACTERIZE EVERYDAY LIFE FOR ITS SUBJECTS.
734	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS THE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOW IN MACEDONIA AND ITS IMPACT UPON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. ITS BASIC PURPOSE IS TO ANALYSE THE INTERCONNECTION OF FDI WITH A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES IN MACEDONIA. WE DECIDED TO APPLY VECTOR ERROR CORRECTION MODEL (VECM) ON FDI IMPACT UPON THE MACEDONIAN ECONOMY. THE FDI INDICATOR IS CALCULATED AS A FUNCTION OF CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC VARIABLES (GDP GROWTH RATE, LABOR PRODUCTIVITY RATE, OPENNESS TO TRADE, CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE) AS WELL AS OF WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW). RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE ECONOMETRIC MODEL SHOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS ON THE IMPACT OF THE UP-TO-DATE FDI INFLOW UPON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MACEDONIAN ECONOMY.
735	THIS ANALYSIS CONSIDERS SOUTH AFRICA'S FIRST CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED JUDICIAL DECISION, THE THABAMETSI CASE, IN WHICH THE COURT CONSIDERED THE QUALITY AND FORM OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT REQUIRED WHEN A COMPETENT AUTHORITY ASSESSES AN APPLICATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORISATION IN SOUTH AFRICA. NOTWITHSTANDING THE LACK OF AN EXPRESS LEGAL OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT A FOCUSED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ASSESSMENT, THE COURT RULED THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A RELEVANT CONSIDERATION WHEN GRANTING AN ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORISATION, AND A FORMAL EXPERT REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IS THE BEST EVIDENTIARY MEANS TO CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THEIR MULTIFACETED DIMENSIONS. DRAWING UPON A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK RECENTLY PUT FORWARD BY PRESTON, THE ANALYSIS ARGUES THAT THE THABAMETSI BENCH HAS MADE A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE LITIGATION, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COURT ADDRESSED EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW.
736	REALIZING UTOPIA IS THE POSTHUMOUS TESTAMENT OF ANTONIO CASSESE AND AN ACT OF FAITH IN THE EMANCIPATORY POWER OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN CHAPTER 15 OF THE BOOK HE ADVOCATES A FURTHER BREACHING OF THE WALL OF SOVEREIGNTY BY ENABLING INTERNATIONAL LAW TO INVALIDATE INCONSISTENT NATIONAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE AMBIGUITIES AND PITFALLS OF THIS APPROACH IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT (2012) JUDGMENT OF THE ICJ IN JURISDICTIONAL IMMUNITIES OF THE STATE. IT ARGUES THAT, CONTRARY TO CASSESE'S PROPOSAL OF OMODERATE MONISM', A COSMOPOLITAN VIEW OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS MAY BE BETTER ADVANCED BY DOMESTIC COURTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN, AS IN THE ICJ CASE, THE REASON OF JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO JUDICIAL REMEDIES ARE TRUMPED BY A DEFERENTIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.
737	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE TYPOLOGIES AS WELL AS EMERGING TRENDS AND THREATS IN MONEY LAUNDERING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - RECENT TRENDS AND EMERGING THREATS IN MONEY LAUNDERING ARE DISCUSSED, BOTH IN TERMS OF PREDICATE ACTIVITIES (DRUGS, FRAUD) AND IN TERMS OF TECHNIQUES/TYPOLOGIES. FINDINGS - IT IS FOUND THAT THE CHALLENGES AND RISKS POSED BY MONEY LAUNDERING TO FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND TO THE RULE OF LAW PERSIST. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - UNDERSTANDING EVOLVING AND EMERGING TYPOLOGIES AND TECHNIQUES IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS MONEY LAUNDERING CHALLENGES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES ARE APPLIED BY REGULATORS AND THE REGULATED TO ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING SYSTEMS; THIS PAPER PROVIDES A MEASURE BY WHICH THE ROBUSTNESS OF THOSE SYSTEMS CAN BE EXAMINED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER PROVIDES A SUCCINCT BUT COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF MONEY LAUNDERING, AS WELL AS A LOOK AT EMERGING THREATS.
738	ILLEGAL LOGGING AND THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ILLEGALLY LOGGED TIMBER ARE A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR MANY TIMBER-PRODUCING COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. IT CAUSES ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, COSTS GOVERNMENTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE, PROMOTES CORRUPTION, AND UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AND FUNDS ARMED CONFLICT. IT RETARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SOME OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. CONSUMER COUNTRIES CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PROBLEMS BY IMPORTING TIMBER AND WOOD PRODUCTS WITHOUT ENSURING THAT THEY ARE LEGALLY SOURCED. IN RECENT YEARS, HOWEVER, PRODUCER AND CONSUMER COUNTRIES ALIKE HAVE PAID INCREASING ATTENTION TO ILLEGAL LOGGING. THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE SITUATION OF THE EIJ'S TIMBER MARKET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ILLEGALLY HARVESTED TIMBER, AND ANALYZES CURRENT LEGISLATIVE MEASURES THAT MAY AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF TIMBER AND THAT MAY INFLUENCE OPERATORS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS.
739	THE STUDY HAD THE OBJECTIVE OF ANALYZING THE NOTION OF VULNERABILITY THAT IS USED BY BIOETHICS TO DEBATE RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN BEINGS TODAY, FROM REFLECTIONS ON BIOPOLITICS IN CONTEMPORARY CULTURE. FOR THIS, THE STARTING POINT WAS GIORGIO AGAMBEN'S READING OF FOUCAULT'S MODEL OF POWER (SOVEREIGNTY AND BIOPOLITICS), WITH THE AIM OF SUBSEQUENTLY ANALYZING THE NOTION OF BARE LIFE: "LIFE WITHOUT ANY VALUE". IF THE DEVICES OF POWER IN MODERN DEMOCRACIES CONJOIN BIOPOLITICAL STRATEGIES WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE STRENGTH OF SOVEREIGN POWER THAT TRANSFORMS LIFE INTO BARE LIFE, IN FACT BIOETHICS MUST BE AN INSTRUMENT FOR PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME VULNERABLE. NEVERTHELESS, BEYOND THE TERRITORY OF THE RULE OF LAW, BIOETHICS MUST ALSO PENETRATE THE UNDIFFERENTIATED ZONES WHERE SOVEREIGNTY AND TECHNIQUES BECOME MIXED, DISRESPECTING THE FRONTIERS OF BIOPOLITICS AND QUESTIONING THE CONDITION OF VULNERABILITY ITSELF.
740	NONGOVERNMENTAL ACTORS PLAY SEVERAL IMPORTANT ROLES IN PROMOTING COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES REGULATIONS. THESE ROLES CONSIST ON THE ONE HAND IN MONITORING, INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING OCCURRENCES OF ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, IN DIRECT ACTIONS IN COASTAL STATES' EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES AND ON THE HIGH SEAS. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS, IN PARTICULAR DATA GATHERING AND SHARING, FALL SQUARELY WITHIN THE EXISTING REGIME OF THE LAW OF THE SEA. OTHER ACTIONS, SUCH AS SOME TYPES OF DIRECT ACTIONS ON THE HIGH SEAS, MAY BE LEGALLY MORE QUESTIONABLE. IN ANY CASE, THE NONGOVERNMENTAL NATURE OF THE ACTORS RAISES ISSUES OF EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AUTHORITY AND ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING EXPECTED RESISTANCE TO REFORM FROM STATES AND NON-STATE ACTORS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO ADAPT AND CLARIFY THE LEGAL REGIME, AT THE RISK OTHERWISE OF UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW.
741	IN 1833, A NEW RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHED THE NEW AGENTS AND FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD REPLACE THE CABILDO IN THE PROVINCE OF SANTA FE, WHICH HAD BEEN RECENTLY EXTINCT. THIS PAPER RECONSTRUCTS THE APPOINTMENT OF THE POSTS FOR THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF FIRST INSTANCE BETWEEN 1833 AND 1852. BOTH THE PERSONAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF THESE MEN REQUIRES TRACKING THEIR PERFORMANCE ALONG THEIR PREVIOUS INSTITUTIONAL LIFE, AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILY TIES AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THEREFORE, THE CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF THIS STUDY RANGES FROM THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CABILDO OF SANTA FE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SECOND JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE IN ROSARIO, WHICH ALLOWS FOR OUTLINING THE TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE PROVINCE'S POLITICAL ORDER AS WELL AS THE CHANGES IN THE PROFILE OF JUDICIAL FIGURES TOWARDS THE SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
742	THE RECENT REPORT BY THE PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE ARRANGEMENTS HAS MADE NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING THAT COURT FEES SHOULD BE CHARGED ON A DIFFERENTIATED BASIS HAVING REGARD TO THE CAPACITY OF THE PARTIES TO PAY UP TO FULL COST RECOVERY OF PROVIDING THE COURT TO HEAR THE CASE. AT THE SAME TIME GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING THE LEVELS OF COURT FEES PARTICULARLY IN CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MATTERS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT EQUATING THE PROVISION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS A SERVICE THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE SOLD IS ANTITHETIC TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE, TRACEABLE TO MAGNA CARTA, THAT JUSTICE WILL NOT BE SOLD OR DENIED AND TO THE RULE OF LAW. HE ASKS WHETHER A CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM WOULD ARISE IF SUCH SIGNIFICANT FEES WERE CHARGED, AS OCCURRED IN CANADA LAST YEAR. HE ALSO DISCUSSES OTHER MORE APPROPRIATE SUGGESTIONS IN THE REPORT.
743	FROM 2009 TO 2011, THE AUTHORS LAUNCHED THE BASIC LAW EDUCATION PROJECT: EDUCATION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A SUBSET OF THE OVERARCHING DATA-SET AND DISCUSSES THE FINDINGS THAT RESULTED FROM A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TWO PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS. A SURVEY WAS DEPLOYED TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH A HUMAN RIGHTS FRIENDLY ETHOS EXISTED IN SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS. RANDOMLY SELECTED STUDENTS AND ALL TEACHERS FROM BOTH SCHOOLS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. THE COLLECTED DATA REVEALED NOTEWORTHY TRENDS IN MEAN SCORES BETWEEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS EQUAL AND FAIR TREATMENT; PROTECTION OF AND APPEAL FOR RIGHTS; AND FEELINGS OF BEING LOVED, RESPECTED, AND BLESSED. SCHOOL MISSION AND LEADERSHIP STYLE APPEARED TO ACCOUNT FOR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, WE OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE HUMAN RIGHTS ETHOS IN SCHOOLS.
744	WAR CRIMES TRIALS ARE CLAIMED TO HOLD THE CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO A RANGE OF AMBITIOUS JUSTICE GOALS IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, SUCH AS THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF VICTIMS' EXPERIENCES, THE PROMOTION OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE FOSTERING OF RECONCILIATION. THIS ARTICLE UNSETTLES THESE CLAIMS THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF THE UN-SPONSORED SERIOUS CRIMES PROCESS IN EAST TIMOR. IT CHARTS THE PRACTICAL AND POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS UPON THE SERIOUS CRIMES PROCESS WHICH UNDERMINED ITS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ITS OWN GOALS. IN ADDITION, IT DRAWS ON INTERVIEWS WITH EAST TIMORESE SURVIVORS TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE SERIOUS CRIMES PROCESS IN FULLY MEETING LOCALLY GROUNDED DEMANDS FOR JUSTICE. THIS ANALYSIS ILLUSTRATES THE INHERENT LIMITS OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS IN RESPONDING TO CALLS FOR JUSTICE, WHICH TRANSCEND THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE CRIMINAL LAW.
745	PURPOSE - THE PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE THE PENETRATION OF POWER IN MEXICO BY DRUG CARTELS AND THE ATTENDANT POLICY CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE HISTORY OF UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY AND CARTELS IS DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE POLICY SOLUTIONS BEING EXPLORED BY THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS PARTNERS LIKE THE USA. FINDINGS - THE CHALLENGES ARE LONGSTANDING, COMPLEX AND DEFY SIMPLE SOLUTIONS. CONCERTED PROBLEM SOLVING CAN CHANGE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE IMPACT OF LONGER TERM INITIATIVES TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW MERITS FURTHER STUDY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - DRUG CARTELS ARE TAKING A HUGE TOLL ON MEXICO, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF VIOLENCE; THIS THREATENS NOT ONLY MEXICO BUT NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES AS WELL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PROBLEMS MEXICO FACES ARE PLACED IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LARGER INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ILLICIT DRUGS.
746	THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF ORGAN PROCUREMENT WHICH RELIES ON DONATION IS INADEQUATE TO THE CURRENT AND FUTURE NEED FOR TRANSPLANTABLE KIDNEYS. THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY IS ACCOMPANIED BY A STEEP HUMAN COST. I ARGUE THAT A REGULATED MARKET IN ORGANS FROM LIVING VENDORS IS THE ONLY PLAUSIBLE SOLUTION, AND THAT OBJECTIONS COMMON TO OPPONENTS OF ORGAN MARKETS ARE DEFEASIBLE. I ARGUE THAT A MORALLY DEFENSIBLE MARKET IN KIDNEYS FROM LIVING VENDORS INCLUDES FOUR CHARACTERISTICS: (1) THE PRIORITY OF SAFETY FOR BOTH VENDORS AND RECIPIENTS, (2) TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE RISKS TO VENDORS AND RECIPIENTS, (3) INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY REGARDING GUIDELINES FOR COOPERATING WITH KIDNEY VENDORS, AND (4) OPERATION UNDER A RULE OF LAW. I CONCLUDE WITH SOME REMARKS ON REMAINING PROBLEMS WITH THIS ACCOUNT, AND OFFER SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW THESE PROBLEMS MIGHT BE ADDRESSED.
747	THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS REGARDING THE AUTONOMY OF WOMEN, IN THE LIGHT OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, ANALYZING HOW THE TREATMENT GIVEN TO VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY IN BRAZILIN THE CRIMINAL SPHERE IT CAN LEAD TO VIOLATIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF BRAZILIAN WOMEN. THIS IS ABIBLIOGRAPHIC STUDY, OF THE TYPE THEORETICAL REVIEW,DEVELOPED FROM ARTICLES AND DISSERTATIONS FOUND IN THE DATABASES SCIELO, PORTAL DE PERIODICOS CAPES AND GOOGLE ACADEMICO. THE FINDINGS WERE STRUCTURED INTO THREE CATEGORIES: 1) SOCIO-HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION IN BRAZIL; 2) WOMEN'S AUTONOMY AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AS AN EXPRESSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS; 3) THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF ABORTION AS AN INSTRUMENT CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING AND PROMOTING THE DIGNITY OF WOMEN.
748	THIS PAPER ANALYZES, THE LINK THAT TIES THE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENON OF CRIMINAL COMPLIANCE WITH GLOBAL STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (HUMAN SECURITY, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT) ESTABLISHED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS) FROM A COMPARATIVE LAW PERSPECTIVE. THE PHENOMENON OF CRIMINAL COMPLIANCE IS CAPABLE OF AVOIDING OR REDUCING THE RISKS ARISING FROM BUSINESS ACTIVITY TO LEVELS OF SOCIAL TOLERANCE. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS APPROACH WILL SERVE FOR DEMOCRATIC STATES TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND, PARTICULARLY, THE LEGAL GUIDELINES RELATED TO THE PREVENTION OF COMPLIANCE WITHIN AND OUTSIDE NATIONAL BORDERS. THUS, THE PRESENT WORK, FOR THE DRAFTING OF WHICH A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC CRIMINAL AND EXTRA-CRIMINAL DOCUMENTS WERE EXAMINED, WARNS THAT THE PREVENTIVE MODEL OFFERED BY COMPLIANCE IN ORDER TO PROTECT LEGAL-CRIMINAL ASSETS MAY BE USEFUL TO CONTAIN OTHER RISKS THAT CAUSE INSECURITY IN CURRENT SOCIETIES.
749	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT POLITICAL COMPETITION DETERMINES HOW AND WHEN ELECTED POLITICIANS CAN REDUCE POLICE AUTONOMY. WHILE BUREAUCRATIC AUTONOMY IS GENERALLY LAUDED IN DEVELOPED DEMOCRACIES, IT CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS MALFEASANCE IN CONTEXTS OF INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS. POLITICAL INCUMBENTS MAY REDUCE POLICE AUTONOMY THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS AND FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. WHILE SOME POLITICIANS SEEK TO PROFESSIONALIZE POLICE FORCES AND ALIGN THEM WITH THE RULE OF LAW, OTHERS ASPIRE TO POLITICIZE POLICE TO APPROPRIATE ITS RENTS FROM CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT LACK OF ROTATION IN OFFICE (LOW POLITICAL TURNOVER) INCREASES POLITICIANS' CONTROL OF POLICE, WHILE UNDER LOW TURNOVER, FRAGMENTATION IN CABINETS AND THE LEGISLATURE INFLUENCES WHETHER POLITICIANS SEEK TO PROFESSIONALIZE OR POLITICIZE THE FORCE. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THIS THEORY WITH A SUBNATIONAL COMPARISON OF RIO DE JANEIRO (BRAZIL) AND SANTA FE (ARGENTINA), RELYING ON 80 INTERVIEWS WITH POLICE AND POLITICIANS.
750	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE ATTENDANT LITERATURE BY BUNDLING GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS AND FOCUSING ON FOREIGN AID INSTABILITY INSTEAD OF FOREIGN AID. WE ASSESS THE ROLE OF FOREIGN AID INSTABILITY ON GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS IN 53 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2010. AN AUTOREGRESSIVE ENDOGENEITY-ROBUST GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS EMPLOYED. INSTABILITIES ARE MEASURED IN TERMS OF VARIANCE OF THE ERRORS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS. THREE MAIN AID INDICATORS ARE USED, NAMELY: TOTAL AID, AID FROM MULTILATERAL DONORS, AND BILATERAL AID. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS IS USED TO BUNDLE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, NAMELY: POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE), ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (REGULATION QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS), INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL), AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE (POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE). OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT FOREIGN AID INSTABILITY INCREASES GOVERNANCE STANDARDS, ESPECIALLY POLITICAL AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
751	THE GLOBAL EXPANSION OF FREE ENTERPRISE HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR SOME TIME, AND THE CHALLENGES FOR GLOBAL COMPANIES ARE WELL-KNOWN. COMPANIES OFTEN OPERATE IN ECONOMICALLY BLIGHTED COMMUNITIES AND IN CORRUPT ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT A RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME WESTERN-BASED GLOBAL CORPORATIONS ARE UNDER INCREASING PUBLIC PRESSURE TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITIES TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OFTEN BEYOND THEIR EXPERTISE OR ECONOMIC PURVIEW. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE 2008 DAVOS MEETINGS BILL GATES PROPOSED THE IDEA OF "CREATIVE CAPITALISM, CHALLENGING BUSINESS TO 'MEET THE NEEDS OF THE POOR IN WAYS THAT GENERATE PROFITS' ... " IN WHAT FOLLOWS I SHALL ARGUE THAT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SUCCESSFUL GLOBAL VENTURES, THE GATES' CHALLENGE REQUIRES ACADEMICS AND MANAGERIAL LEADERS TO RETHINK THEIR MIND SETS AND EXPAND THEIR THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN BY GLOBALIZATION, POVERTY, AND THE MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF FREE ENTERPRISE.
752	TO ACHIEVE THE MODEL PROPOSED FOR LAW, THERE IS A NEED TO ADVOCATE A SPECIFIC PLAY OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WHAT IS IT? ACCORDING TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID, A PROCEDURAL DEMOCRACY WOULD BE NO GOOD TO US, AS, IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE HUMAN RIGHTS OPERATE A PRIMARY TRANSFORMATION INSOFAR AS THEY REFER TO THE OPERATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC MECHANISMS WITH REGARD TO THEIR SCOPE AND LIMITS; THIS MEANS THAT DEMOCRACY IS NOT ALWAYS A POSSIBLE RESULT IN MORALLY ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS, NOR IS IT ALWAYS AN APPROPRIATE OR DESIRABLE RESULT. IN CONTRAST, WHAT WE KNOW AS MATERIAL IMPLIES THE CONSIDERATION OF A SERIES OF VALUES AS BELONGING TO DEMOCRACY; THESE VALUES ARE, BECAUSE OF THEIR LINK WITH LIBERALISM, FREEDOM AND FORMAL EQUALITY AND, BECAUSE OF THEIR LINK WITH ETHICAL SOCIALISM, MATERIAL EQUALITY AND SOLIDARITY.
753	REVIEWING THE DECADE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY SINCE 9/11 REVEALS A CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN POLICIES RATHER THAN A BREAK WITH THE PAST. EXTRADITION, FOREIGN INTERVENTIONS, AND SUPPORT FOR UNREPRESENTATIVE REGIMES FOR THE SAKE OF NATIONAL INTERESTS HAVE A LONG HISTORY AND THE RESPONSE TO THE EVENTS SAW A RISE IN THEIR USAGE. OFFICIAL MYTHOLOGY AROUND 9/11 HAS CREATED A FALSE NARRATIVE OF VICTIMHOOD AND BEEN USED TO JUSTIFY ALL MANNER OF CONTRAVENTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW ABROAD AND AT HOME IN THE US. THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA ALSO REPRESENTS A CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME'S POLICY, AND A DECADE ON FROM 9/11 THE MEMORIES OF THOSE LOST AT THE SITE AND AS A RESULT OF THE SUBSEQUENT AMERICAN "WAR OF TERROR" ARE BOTH RECOGNIZED AS VICTIMS OF US FOREIGN POLICY.
754	BLACK SEA REGION COUNTRIES HAVE DIVERSE POLITICAL SYSTEMS, RANGING FROM DEVELOPED DEMOCRACIES TO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. COMMUNIST PAST AND A LACK OF DEMOCRATIC EXPERIENCE HAVE STALLED OR REVERSED DEMOCRATISATION PROCESSES IN MANY CASES. FLAWED LEGAL SYSTEMS AND A PUBLIC DISTRUST OF INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN PAIRED WITH GROWING EXECUTIVE POWER IN MANY COUNTRIES. INCREASING INEQUALITY AND UNRESOLVED CONFLICTS UNDERMINE PRO-DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AS WELL. IN SEEKING TO ENHANCE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION, CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS SHOULD BE GIVEN BROAD PRACTICAL SUPPORT. AID TO STATES SHOULD BE LINKED TO DEMOCRATIC REFORM, AND COMBINED WITH SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY BUILDING. JUDICIAL REFORMS AND A STRONGER RULE OF LAW WILL BE CRITICAL IN STABILIZING THE REGION'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. THE EU, IN PARTICULAR, NEEDS TO DEVELOP A COHERENT REGIONAL POLICY, WHICH MUST INCLUDE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA AND TURKEY.
755	THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS TO CONSIDER IT AS THE PRODUCT OF THE MUTUAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE LEGITIMATION RESOURCES OF THE MEMBER STATES AND OF SUPRANATIONAL BODIES. THIS PARALLELISM BETWEEN DIFFERENT SOURCES OF LEGITIMATION IS AN INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT OF MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE. INTEGRATION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT RELEASE DEMOCRATIC STATES COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO SUBJECT POLITICAL RULE TO LEGITIMACY; RATHER, IT GIVES THE STATE A CENTRAL ROLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE TASK OF THE EU IS NOT TO OVERCOME THE DEMOCRATIC STATE BUT TO SHAPE STRUCTURES OF DISCOURSE THAT GO BEYOND STATES. THIS KIND OF "POST-EMOTIVE" UNDERSTANDING OF THE EU TAKES DUE ACCOUNT OF THE UNION'S FRAGMENTED SOCIETAL FOUNDATIONS, AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GUARANTEE A CONTINUOUS PROCESS OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION.
756	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC CATCHING-UP. SPECIFICALLY, WE CONDUCTED A LITERATURE REVIEW AND PROPOSED A FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE HOW CHINA HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE DOUBLE-DIGIT ANNUAL GROWTH IN THE LAST TWO DECADES DESPITE THE GENERAL ABSENCE OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE FIND THAT SIMILAR TO OTHER EAST ASIAN CATCHING-UP ECONOMIES, CHINA IS AT THE STAGE OF A MARKET-PRESERVING AUTHORITARIANISM. INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND EXPERIENCES LED DENG AND OTHER SENIOR LEADERS TO PRESERVE THE MARKET FOR CATCHING-UP. ECONOMIC DECENTRALIZATION AND AUTONOMY ON THE ONE HAND, AND POLITICAL CONTROL AND COORDINATION ON THE OTHER HAND, MADE THE POLICIES TO PRESERVE THE MARKET UNDER AUTHORITARIANISM LARGELY CREDIBLE.

757	THROUGH AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF SELECTED AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR A PERIOD OF 2006-2017, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THREE HYPOTHESES SUGGESTING THAT AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP DOES NOT PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY EXCEPT THERE ARE CONDUCIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THE STUDY APPLIES PANEL DATA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES ON DATA OBTAINED FROM SEVENTEEN COUNTRIES IN AFRICA. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (1) AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP DOES NOT PROMOTE PRODUCTIVITY. (2) WE DO NOT CONFIRM ANY SIGNIFICANT U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND PRODUCTIVITY IN AFRICA. (3) AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROMOTES PRODUCTIVITY VIA CONDUCIVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AT A THRESHOLD VALUE OF 4.56 ON A SCALE OF 0 TO 5 POINT. AMONG THE INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION RESPECTIVELY TURN TO BE MORE RELEVANT IN THE SELECTED COUNTRIES. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT STRONG INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WOULD HELP IN PROMOTING TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY IN AFRICA.
758	NONGOVERNMENTAL ACTORS PLAY SEVERAL IMPORTANT ROLES IN PROMOTING COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES REGULATIONS. THESE ROLES CONSIST ON THE ONE HAND IN MONITORING, INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING OCCURRENCES OF ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, IN DIRECT ACTIONS IN COASTAL STATES' EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONES AND ON THE HIGH SEAS. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS, IN PARTICULAR DATA GATHERING AND SHARING, FALL SQUARELY WITHIN THE EXISTING REGIME OF THE LAW OF THE SEA. OTHER ACTIONS, SUCH AS SOME TYPES OF DIRECT ACTIONS ON THE HIGH SEAS, MAY BE LEGALLY MORE QUESTIONABLE. IN ANY CASE, THE NONGOVERNMENTAL NATURE OF THE ACTORS RAISES ISSUES OF EFFICIENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AUTHORITY AND ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING EXPECTED RESISTANCE TO REFORM FROM STATES AND NON-STATE ACTORS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED TO ADAPT AND CLARIFY THE LEGAL REGIME, AT THE RISK OTHERWISE OF UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW.
759	THE CONTENTS OF THE PREAMBLES OF THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN STALES ARE ANALYZED, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEM, TO CLASSIFY THEM, AND TO EXPOSE THEM IN U COMPARATIVE WAY. FROM THIS, WE CAN ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE PREAMBLES MID THE CURRENT. MODEL OF RULE OF LAW AND THEIR TOLE AS IDEOLOGICAL ITEMS FOR PRODUCING BOTH LEGAL NORMS AND THE RESPECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL HERMENEUTICS, SPECIFICALLY, IS THE CONTROL TRIALS OR CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSE. THEN ICE DESCRIBE THIS CONCEPT'S EVOLUTION, MEANING, CONTENTS, FUNCTIONS. AND PURPOSES, BY EXAMINING PROCLAMATIONS ASSUMED AS METANARRATIVES THAT SUMMARIZE COHESIVE POLITICAL AFFIRMATIONS,FROM DIFFERENT NATURE (AKIOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, MYTHICAL, HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL), AND PRETEND 10 LEGITIMIZE A NEW SOCIOPOLITICAL PROJECT OR AN EXISTING ONE. THOSE PROCLAMATIONS ARE TAKEN, FROM THE POLITICAL LETTERS OF THE LATIN AMERICAN STATES. THROUGH, A METHODOLOGY OF QUALITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS.
760	IN THE PAST TWO DECADES, IT HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE FOR LEGISLATIVE-JUDICIAL ENGAGEMENT ON CONTESTED CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS TO BE DESCRIBED AS A DIALOGUE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO ABANDON THE NOTION OF DIALOGUE. THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE DIFFICULTIES WITH DIALOGUE THEORIES. DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF MANY DIFFERENT VERSIONS, THESE THEORIES SHARE CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONALLY PROBLEMATIC CHARACTERISTICS. DIALOGUE THEORIES PROMOTE A VIEW OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS UNREALISTIC, SUSCEPTIBLE TO NORMATIVE BIAS AND THAT OVERLOOKS THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES TO A SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER ARGUES THAT CHRISTOPHER ANSELL'S IDEA OF COLLABORATION-AS-FRUITFUL-CONFLICT PROVIDES A MORE DESCRIPTIVELY AND NORMATIVELY APPROPRIATE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
761	THE LAW OF COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND IN NIGERIA IS ROOTED IN THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION. IT IS ENSHRINED THAT EVERY NIGERIAN HAS THE RIGHT TO OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THAT SUCH PROPERTY SHALL NOT BE ACQUIRED COMPULSORILY, EXCEPT IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES PRESCRIBED BY A LAW THAT REQUIRES BOTH THE PAYMENT OF PROMPT COMPENSATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW ON ACCESS TO COURT. IN 2012, THE SUPREME COURT OF NIGERIA DELIVERED THREE DECISIONS ON THE COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND OR THE REVOCATION OF OCCUPANCY RIGHTS; ALHAJI TSOHO DAN AMALE V SOKOTO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS; GOLDMARK NIGERIA LIMITED AND OTHERS V IBAFON COMPANY LIMITED AND OTHERS; AND OHOCHUKWU V ATTORNEY GENERAL OF RIVERS STATE AND OTHERS. THESE THREE CASES LAID DOWN PRINCIPLES ON THE SUBJECT WHICH ARE WORTHY OF EXPOSITION.
762	LAW IS A SYSTEM OF NORMS WHOSE PURPOSE IS, AMONG OTHERS, TO REGULATE SOCIAL RELATIONS THROUGH THE POWER OF THE STATE. THIS DEALS WITH UNDERSTANDING THE PLEXUS OF POWERS THAT ORIGINATE AND END LAWS AS A SOCIAL MEDIATOR THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO GUARANTEE LIBERTY, JUSTICE AND PEACE. NEVERTHELESS, LEGAL COMPONENTS AND IMPERATIVE PRACTICES DEVELOP IN DIVERSE MANNERS ACCORDING TO THE IDEOLOGICAL OR HEGEMONIC PLANE OF THE POLITICAL CULTURE THAT SERVES AS THEIR BASIS. INTERPRETIVE PROBLEMS OF THE LEGAL NORM ARE COMPLEX SINCE THE CONSCRIPTION OF CONDUCT THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW PUTS CITIZEN AUTONOMY AT RISK. THIS DEALS WITH APPLYING LAW IN THE "PROGRESSIVE" SENSE, THAT IS, IN FULFILLMENT OF NORMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO GROWING THE CONTEXT OF POSSIBILITIES THAT CITIZENS HAVE TO GENERATE SOCIAL CHANGES AND LEAVE THE SPHERE OF LIBERAL DOMINATION BY THE WELFARE STATE.
763	SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION INCIDENTS HAPPEN IN CHINA EVERY YEAR. HOWEVER, ONLY A FEW OF THEM HAVE BEEN FILED AS ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CRIMINAL CASES. WE ARGUE IN THIS PAPER THAT THE MAIN REASON IS BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES OFTEN REFUSE TO TRANSFER THE SUSPECTED ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CRIMINAL CASES TO THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THEREFORE, IT'S CRITICAL TO BETTER SUPERVISE THE TRANSFER OF CASES FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS TO PRESSING CRIMINAL CHARGES ON THE SUSPECTS INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM GET AWAY WITH ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES. THE SUPERVISION MECHANISMS INCLUDE AT LEAST THE INTERIOR SUPERVISION BY OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND THE EXTERIOR SUPERVISION BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AN EFFECTIVELY FUNCTIONING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEM IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND RULE OF LAW IN CHINA.
764	WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF GENERALIZED TRUST ON LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH. UNLIKE IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE USE BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING TO DEAL RIGOROUSLY WITH MODEL UNCERTAINTY AND ATTENDANT OMITTED VARIABLE BIAS. IN ADDITION, WE ADDRESS ENDOGENEITY AND ASSESS WHETHER THE EFFECT OF TRUST ON GROWTH IS CAUSAL. EXAMINING MORE THAN FORTY REGRESSORS FOR NEARLY FIFTY COUNTRIES, WE SHOW THAT TRUST EXERTS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON LONG-TERM GROWTH AND, BASED ON THE POSTERIOR INCLUSION PROBABILITIES, SUGGEST THAT TRUST IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF LONG-TERM GROWTH. OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT TRUST IS KEY FOR GROWTH IN COUNTRIES WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW. JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS 41 (3) (2013) 777-788.

765	THIS TEXT CONTAINS PROFESSOR BENOIT PELLETIER'S SPEECH PRESENTED AS A PLENARY AT THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR CANADIAN STUDIES 35TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, DEMOCRACY AS A WORK IN PROGRESS: THE INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL DYNAMICS OF THE CANADIAN IDEA, UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, 6-8 APRIL 2010. FURTHER UPDATING OF THE TEXT OCCURRED PRIOR TO GOING TO PRINT (DECEMBER 2010). BENOIT PELLETIER REMINDS US THAT, SINCE ITS CREATION IN 1867, CANADA HAS PROVIDED A PART OF THE ANSWER TO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES CONFRONTING US TODAY, WHICH IS THE CHALLENGE OF MANAGING INTERDEPENDENCE AND ENHANCING DIVERSITY. THE AUTHOR ALSO EXAMINES SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF CANADA'S IDENTITY. AMONG THESE ARE FEDERALISM, CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY, PARLIAMENTARIANISM, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, A CUMBERSOME CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCEDURE AND DEMOCRACY.
766	COURTS THAT PERFORM WELL ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. WHEN COURTS ARE PERCEIVED AS LEGALISTIC, FAIR, IMPARTIAL, AND INDEPENDENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF EXTRAJUDICIAL ACTORS, AGGRIEVED INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PURSUE LITIGATION OVER OTHER, POTENTIALLY UNLAWFUL, ALTERNATIVES. USING ORIGINAL DATA FROM SURVEYS OF MORE THAN 1,800 RANDOMLY SAMPLED LAWYERS IN 12 RUSSIAN CITIES, WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND POWER DIVERSIFICATION ON A VARIETY OF INDICATORS OF PERCEIVED JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. WE FIND THAT, ACCORDING TO LAWYERS, FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE ON THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO INDEPENDENT EFFECT ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE, BUT FINANCIAL DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS CONSISTENTLY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS. WE ALSO FIND THAT DIVERSIFIED POLITICAL POWER HAS CONSISTENTLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PERCEIVED JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE DIVERSIFICATION MAKES COURTS SEEM LESS VULNERABLE TO UNIFIED PRESSURE FROM POLITICAL ACTORS.
767	AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE OF DEMOCRACY, BASED ON RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, SOME PARTS OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE STILL LAGGING FAR BEHIND OTHERS. FOLLOWING REPORTS THAT THE PROVINCIAL DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION ARE NEGLECTING SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FAR-FLUNG RURAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, A SURVEY WAS UNDERTAKEN ON THE CORE PEDAGOGICAL FUNCTION OF EDUCATORS. THE SURVEY FOCUSED ON THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE NEED FOR CREATING AND IMPROVING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LEARNERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP THEM IMPROVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SUBMITTED TO A SAMPLE OF RELATIVELY EXPERIENCED SCHOOL MANAGERS AND EDUCATORS IN LIMPOPO PROVINCE. MOST RESPONDENTS FELT THE NEED TO ESTABLISH AND IMPROVE SUCH RELATIONSHIPS, BUT A RELATIVELY LARGE PERCENTAGE ALSO PERCEIVED SUCH SUPPORT SERVICES TO BE EITHER NON-EXISTENT OR UNAVAILABLE TO THEM.
768	IUS CONSTITUTIONALE COMMUNE IN LATIN AMERICA (ICCAL) IS AN ACADEMIC ENDEAVOUR THAT ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE AN ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGINAL LATIN AMERICAN PATH OF TRANSFORMATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM, COMPRISING ELEMENTS FROM NATIONAL, TRANSNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS, AND WHERE THE LAW IS PLACED AT THE SERVICE OF THE NORMATIVE TRINITY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, NAMELY THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IN THIS REGARD, ICCAL SPEAKS OF AN INTER-AMERICAN LAW THAT REPRESENTS A NEW LEGAL PHENOMENON, IN A REGION WHERE CONSTITUTIONALIST IDEAS HAVE ALLEGEDLY CLAIMED NEW TRACTION. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DEVELOP TWO MAIN CRITIQUES THAT CAN BE DEEMED CHALLENGES FOR AN ACADEMIC PROJECT THAT IS STILL 'UNDER CONSTRUCTION', AND PROVIDE AN INTELLECTUAL MAP OF LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT COULD ADDRESS THESE CRITIQUES AND SERVE AS A ROADMAP FOR STUDYING POTENTIAL LATIN AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEBATES AROUND GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM.
769	THE FIRST COLD WAR BEGAN WITH THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION AND ENDED WITH THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THE USSR LOST THE SECOND COLD WAR. NOW, A NEW COLD WAR IS UNDERWAY. THE WEST IS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE REDISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AND HUMAN CAPITAL. RUSSIA'S PROSPECTS FOR WINNING THIS CONFLICT ARE GOOD. THE WESTERN IDEOLOGY OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW IS BECOMING LESS CONVINCING. LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS IN CRISIS. RUSSIA CAN PROVE THAT ITS AUTHORITARIAN ORDER IS SUPERIOR. IT HAS RESTORED ITS ABILITY TO WAGE WAR AND HAS RAW MATERIALS AT ITS DISPOSAL IN SIBERIA. THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IS POSITIVE. THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCE OF SUPPORT IS CHINA. AND RUSSIA'S ELITES AND CITIZENS ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE MORALLY. TO WIN THE THIRD COLD WAR, RUSSIA WILL NEED AN ALL-OUT NATIONAL EFFORT AND AN OFFENSIVE IDEOLOGY.
770	FOCUSED ON DEMOCRATIC AND HYBRID REGIMES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT DISSUADE OR RESTRAIN GOVERNMENTS FROM CLAMPING DOWN ON PRESS FREEDOMS. WE SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENTS MIGHT HESITATE TO INTERFERE WITH THE MEDIA FOR THREE REASONS: THEY MAY FACE EXCESSIVE POLITICAL OR LEGAL COSTS FOR SUCH INTERFERENCE; THEY MIGHT HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM TO CURTAIL MEDIA FREEDOMS, AND, FINALLY, UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, GOVERNMENTS MAY OBTAIN A LIMITED PAYOFF FROM EFFORTS TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE MEDIA. CONSISTENT WITH ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT MOTIVATES SOME OF OUR HYPOTHESES, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT STRONG MEDIA SECTORS WITHIN CIVIL SOCIETY ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT RESPECT FOR MEDIA FREEDOMS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE FAVOURABLE CLIMATES FOR THE MEDIA. THIS LIKELY REFLECTS THE PROTECTION FREE MEDIA RECEIVE FROM INDEPENDENT JUDICIARIES.
771	A REVIEW OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND ITS PERMANENT MEMBERS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW SHOWS, FIRST OF ALL, THAT WHILE THE COUNCIL HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY "SEIZED" WITH THIS SUBJECT MATTER, NARROW CONCEPTIONS OF NATIONAL INTEREST OFTEN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE QUEST FOR A HUMANE RULE OF LAW IN WORLD AFFAIRS. SECONDLY, AGREEMENT AMONG THE P-5 OFTEN PROVES DIFFICULT, CONTRIBUTING TO A WIDE ARRAY OF ADOPTED MEASURES ON THIS SUBJECT WITHOUT GREAT CONSISTENCY. THE COUNCIL'S TOOLBOX IS LARGE AND VARIED, BUT A DEPENDABLE AND CONSISTENT PATTERN OF POLICY MAKING HAS PROVEN ELUSIVE. LASTLY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE "BIG THREE"-CHINA, RUSSIA, AND THE UNITED STATES-DOUBLE STANDARDS ARE BLATANT AS THEY OFTEN DEMAND OF OTHERS WHAT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THEMSELVES. NEVERTHELESS, THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS PAID MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW THAN MANY OBSERVERS FORECAST DURING THE COLD WAR.
772	IN THIS STUDY, OUR AIM IS TO MEASURE PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY AND TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC SECTOR ECONOMIC INTERVENTIONS. WE USE THE RULE OF LAW & BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, ALLOCATION, ECONOMIC STABILITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION AS OUTPUTS; PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REGULATION AS INPUTS. IN THE STUDY, WE COMPUTE PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY SCORES BY USING A NON-PARAMETRIC, RELATIVE EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE, DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA), FOR 51 COUNTIES BETWEEN 1995 AND 2000. THE STUDY FINDS THAT OVERALL PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY INCREASES FROM 1995 TO 2000 AND THERE IS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO FIND THAT A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC SECTOR INTERVENTION AND THE EFFICIENCY SCORES. FINALLY, IT IS FOUND THAT THE REGULATION TOOL IS WASTED IN COMPARISON WITH THE EXPENDITURE TOOL.

774	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS ORIGINAL RESEARCH FINDINGS ON THE STATE OF ANTI-TRAFFICKING EFFORTS IN MEXICO. BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM GOVERNMENT, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATIONS, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES DATA ON THE CHALLENGES THESE ACTORS FACE, ESPECIALLY REGARDING CORRUPTION AND VIOLENCE. IT ARGUES FOR EIGHT ACTIONS TO IMPROVE PREVENTION, PROTECTION, AND PROSECUTION: 1. COLLECT MORE AND BETTER DATA; 2. RETAIN OFFICIALS; 3. SUPPORT SHELTERS; 4. EMPLOY BETTER EVALUATION MEASURES AND USE MULTIPLIERS; 5. PROVIDE TECHNICAL HELP TO NGOS; 6. DESIGN A COORDINATION PLATFORM; 7. INCREASE THE RULE OF LAW, AND 8. PROMOTE HIGH-LEVEL INTEREST TO PUSH THE TOPIC OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA IN MEXICO. IN SUM, THESE EIGHT ACTIONS ADDRESS THE DEFICIENCIES THIS RESEARCH FOUND, AND OUTLINES CONCRETE STEPS EACH ACTOR CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING REGIME IN MEXICO.
775	WE ARE THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE MARKET REACTION TO 13 ANNOUNCEMENT DATES RELATED TO IFRS 9 FOR OVER 5400 EUROPEAN LISTED FIRMS. WE FIND AN OVERALL POSITIVE REACTION TO THE INTRODUCTION OF IFRS 9. THE REGULATION IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRMS IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER RULE OF LAW AND A SMALLER DIVERGENCE BETWEEN LOCAL GAAP AND IAS 39. BOOTSTRAP SIMULATIONS RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT SAMPLING ERROR OR DATA MINING ARE DRIVING OUR FINDINGS. OUR MAIN FINDINGS ARE ALSO ROBUST TO CONFOUNDING EVENTS AND THE EXTENT OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE FOR EACH EVENT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INVESTORS PERCEIVE THE NEW REGULATION AS SHAREHOLDER-WEALTH ENHANCING AND-SUPPORT THE VIEW-THAT STRONGER COMPARABILITY ACROSS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OF EUROPEAN FIRMS IS BENEFICIAL TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS AND OUTWEIGHS THE COSTS OF POORER FIRM-SPECIFIC INFORMATION.

776	FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAVE BECOME MORE REGULATED THAN EVER BEFORE, SPEAKING GENERALLY ABOUT THE GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMY AND THE INTERACTIONS AMONG STATES, INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE EU AND ASEAN. HOWEVER, HOW IS THIS INCREASED NORMATIVITY, SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY, TO BE THEORIZED IN RELATION TO THE TWO CLASSICAL PARADIGMS: REALISM VERSUS IDEALISM OR LIBERALISM? ON THE ONE HAND, A NEW REALIST INTERPRETATION HAS BEEN LAUNCHED BY POSNER. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NEW COSMOPOLITANISM OF CANEY ENVISAGES FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON THE MODEL OF DOMESTIC AFFAIRS IN SO-CALLED WELL-ORDERED COUNTRIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT BOTH POSITIONS FAIL TO RENDER A CREDIBLE ACCOUNT OF THE INCREASING RELEVANCE OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW (PIL) FOR INTER ALIA POLITICS AND ECONOMICS TODAY. YET, THE FUNCTIONS OF PIL DO NOT MATCH THE ROLES OF RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
777	WHY DO SOME CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITIONS TRIGGER THE EMERGENCE OF PROGRESSIVE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM? THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATION OF THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND ITS SUBSEQUENT ACTIVISM TOWARD RIGHTS IN GENERAL AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH IN PARTICULAR. THIS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT IDEATIONAL VARIABLES ARE CRUCIAL TO EXPLAIN THIS OUTCOME. ON THE ONE HAND, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S BEHAVIOR REFLECTS THE DOMINANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTION THAT IT IS THE JUDICIARY'S ROLE TO HELP FULFILL THE PROMISES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT. ON THE OTHER, PROGRAMMATIC BELIEFS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND MARKET-DRIVEN ECONOMIC GROWTH LED POWERHOLDERS TO CREATE THE COURT AND APPOINT JUDGES WITH THIS ORIENTATION. THE EMERGENCE OF PROGRESSIVE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IN COLOMBIA, THIS ANALYSIS SUGGESTS, WAS THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOME OF PURPOSEFUL POLITICAL CHOICES MADE BY PROPONENTS OF NEOLIBERAL ECONOMICS.
778	WHILE THEORETICAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT TRADE IS LIKELY TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOME LEVELS, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS RATHER MIXED. FOR SOME COUNTRIES, TRADE HAS A STRONG IMPACT ON GROWTH, WHEREAS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES THERE IS NO OR EVEN A NEGATIVE LINKAGE. WE EXAMINE ONE LIKELY PREREQUISITE FOR A WELFARE INCREASING IMPACT OF TRADE, THAT IS, THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. USING SEVERAL MODEL SPECIFICATIONS, INCLUDING AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE APPROACH, WE IDENTIFY THOSE ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAT MATTER MOST FOR THE POSITIVE LINKAGE BETWEEN TRADE AND GROWTH. WE FIND THAT, ABOVE ALL, LABOUR MARKET REGULATION IS THE KEY TO REDUCING TRADE-RELATED ADJUSTMENT COSTS. MARKET ENTRY REGULATIONS, THE EFFICIENCY OF THE TAX SYSTEM, THE RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS DO PLAY A ROLE TOO. IN ESSENCE, THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT COUNTRIES WITH LOW-QUALITY INSTITUTIONS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM TRADE.
779	THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTION OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA IS EXAMINED IN THIS ARTICLE TO ARGUE THAT, WHILE CONSTITUTIONS ARE ABLE TO SET UP INSTITUTIONS AND DEFINE THEIR JURISDICTION, THEY ARE LESS EFFECTIVE IN ESTABLISHING VALUES AND NORMS. CONSTITUTIONS ESTABLISH BROAD FRAMEWORKS FOR POLITICS BUT ARE RARELY SUCCESSFUL IN DETERMINING THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICS OR THE CONDUCT OF PARTIES, WHICH DEPEND PRINCIPALLY ON SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM IN PNG HAS BEEN INFLUENCED MORE BY TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF DAN LEADERSHIP AND RECIPROCITY THAN BY ANY WESTMINSTER CONVENTION. IN PNG, THE COURTS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL OF ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IN MANY OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE WEAKNESS OF THE STATE-POLITICAL SYSTEM. NEVERTHELESS, THERE REMAINS CONSIDERABLE TENSION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY AS IT HAS DEVELOPED IN PNG.
780	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE SITUATION DERIVED FROM THE "SHOOTING DOWN AIRPLANES" BUT WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED TO OTHER SIMILAR CASES, WHICH GENERICALLY COULD BE CONCEPTUALIZE AS COMMUNITY OF DANGER. THESE CASES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONCURRENCE OF A RISK TO TWO (OR MORE) LEGAL ASSETS, BUT BOTH OF THEM CANNOT BE SAVED AND BOTH OF THEM WOULD BE AFFECTED IF NOTHING WERE DONE. THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY THE MAJORITARIAN LITERATURE TO THIS ISSUE IS INSUFFICIENT, BOTH FROM A DOGMATIC AND A POLITICAL-CRIMINAL POINT OF VIEW, CREATING AN UNCERTAINTY THAT IS REVEALED IN THE DIFFERENT VIEWS THAT POLITICAL POWER AND JURISPRUDENCE/CASELAW HAVE ON THE ISSUE. IN SUMMARY, THIS PAPER AIMS TO OVERCOME THIS STATE OF UNCERTAINTY BY PROVIDING A SOLUTION BASED ON MATERIAL, NON-CONSEQUENTIALIST CRITERIA THAT RESPECT THE GUARANTEES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
781	THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SPECULATION, BUT NOT OF SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY OFFERS SUCH AN ANALYSIS BY EXAMINING AN IMPORTANT CHANNEL OF COOPERATION AGAINST TERRORISM: INTERNATIONAL POLICE LIAISONS, SUCH AS THE FBI AGENTS DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT POLICE LIAISONS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE SENT TO COUNTRIES WHERE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE WIDESPREAD, SINCE REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS SEE THREAT IN FOREIGN AGENTS STATIONED ON THEIR TERRITORY. SURVIVAL ANALYSIS FINDS SUPPORT FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS. AN FBI PRESENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OR A STRONG RULE OF LAW IN THE HOST COUNTRY; BUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN FBI DEPLOYMENT. THESE FINDINGS SUBSTANTIATE A LINK BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION, OFFERING INSIGHTS FOR THE STUDY OF CROSS-BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TRANSGOVERNMENTAL NETWORKS.
782	THE CRIME STRUCTURE "MALICIOUS DEFAULT OF THE JUDICIAL CERTIFICATE, HINDRANCE TO EXECUTION" NEEDS PERFECTION. REVEALING OF THE BASES AND MODERNIZATION WAYS HAS CRIMINALLY-RULE OF LAW MADE A RESEARCH OBJECTIVE. WITH A VIEW OF AN EXACT STATEMENT OF NORM IT IS EXPEDIENT TO DEFINE CONCEPT MALICIOUS DEFAULT IN ARTICLE NOTE. IT IS RATIONAL TO FIX GENERALIZING CONCEPT "THE JUDICIAL CERTIFICATE" WITHOUT A CONCRETE DEFINITION OF JUDICIAL INSTRUCTIONS. AS SUBJECTS OF A CRIME IT SUGGESTED TO SPECIFY THE OFFICIAL AND THE WORKER OF THE ORGANIZATION. IT IS NECESSARY TO DIVIDE ITEM 315 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON TWO PARTS: A PART THE FIRST SHOULD ESTABLISH RESPONSIBILITY OF PHYSICAL PERSONS FOR THE SPECIFIED ACT (THE GENERAL SUBJECT, INCLUDING THE DEBTOR WHO IS NOT EXECUTING THE JUDGEMENT); THE PART THE SECOND SHOULD BE DEVOTED SPECIAL SUBJECTS, I.E. OFFICIALS.
783	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY (TFP) USING A PANEL DATA MODEL INVOLVING 15 PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 2008-2019. THE ECONOMETRIC EVIDENCE, BASED ON THE ARELLANO-BOND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS, SHOWS THAT: 1) EDUCATION RAISES TFP, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT HIGHLY QUALIFIED WORKERS ARE MORE ABLE TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ABSORB EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, 2) OIL RENTS LOWER TFP, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCE CURSE (NRC) HYPOTHESIS AND, THEREFORE, WITH THE VIEW THAT RENT-SEEKING AND CORRUPTION PREVENT SOME OIL-RICH NATIONS FROM PROSPERING, AND 3) THE INTERACTION TERM INVOLVING OIL RENTS AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT YIELDS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON TFP, WHICH MEANS THAT IMPOSING THE RULE OF LAW, ERADICATING CORRUPTION, AND IMPROVING REGULATORY QUALITY CAN EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO REVERSING THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF OIL ABUNDANCE ON TFP.
784	IN THE PRESENT ESSAY, WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONSENSUALITY AND ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER IDENTIFYING IN BRAZILIAN LEGISLATION THE EXPRESS BASIS FOR AGREEMENTS AS A TOOL FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND CITIZENS (ART. 26 OF DECRETO-LEI N DEGREES 4.657/1942), WE HIGHLIGHT ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE IDEAL OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS GUIDED BY EFFICIENCY AND REALIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. FINALLY, WE APPROACH THE ADVANTAGES AND RISKS OF THE NEW METHOD OF ACTION DEFENDED FOR THE STATE, PROPOSING, AS A COUNTERMEASURE TO ITS POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS, THE VALORIZATION OF THE PUBLIC DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, WHICH MUST RESULT IN A SUFFICIENTLY MOTIVATED DECISION THAT SERVES AS A PARAMETER FOR FUTURE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STUDY, WE USED A BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW AND THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD.
785	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE ROLE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN FOSTERING PRO-POOR AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH. USING A SAMPLE OF 112 COUNTRIES OVER 1975-2012, IT SHOWS THAT GROWTH IS GENERALLY PRO-POOR. HOWEVER, GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN INCLUSIVE, AS ILLUSTRATED BY A DECLINE IN THE BOTTOM 20 PERCENT OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. WHILE ALL FEATURES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE SUPPORT INCOME GROWTH AND REDUCE POVERTY, ONLY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE FOUND TO ENHANCE INCLUSIVE GROWTH. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DETERMINANTS OF PRO-POOR AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH HIGHLIGHTS THAT EDUCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT, AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ARE THE KEY FACTORS IN POVERTY REDUCTION AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH. RELYING ON THE PANEL SMOOTH TRANSITION REGRESSION (PSTR) MODEL, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES A NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND PRO-POOR GROWTH, WHILE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE ON INCLUSIVE GROWTH APPEARS TO BE LINEAR.
786	RECENT STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL CONFLICT AND DOMESTIC TERRORISM ON ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OUTCOMES. THIS PAPER USES THE RISE IN MASS VIOLENCE BETWEEN 1870 AND 1940 AS AN HISTORICAL EXPERIMENT FOR DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF ETHNIC AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, NAMELY PATENTING. I FIND THAT VIOLENT ACTS ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 1,100 MISSING PATENTS COMPARED TO 726 ACTUAL PATENTS AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN INVENTORS OVER THIS PERIOD. VALUABLE PATENTS DECLINE IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR RIOTS AND SEGREGATION LAWS. ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW COVARIES WITH DECLINES IN PATENT PRODUCTIVITY FOR WHITE AND BLACK INVENTORS, BUT THIS DECLINE IS SIGNIFICANT ONLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN INVENTORS. PATENTING RESPONDS POSITIVELY TO DECLINES IN VIOLENCE. THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT ETHNIC AND POLITICAL CONFLICT MAY AFFECT THE LEVEL, DIRECTION, AND QUALITY OF INVENTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER TIME.
787	CONCEPTS SUCH AS "QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT" AND "GOOD GOVERNANCE" REFER TO A DESIRED CHARACTER OF THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY. RECENTLY THE INTEREST IN GOOD GOVERNANCE, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT, AND SIMILAR CONCEPTS HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY. HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS INCREASING INTEREST AND USE, AN ADEQUATE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT HAS PROVED DIFFICULT TO FIND. THIS ARTICLE CRITICIZES RECENT ATTEMPTS AT SUCH A DEFINITION AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE, MORE COMPLEX DEFINITION THAT INCLUDES MORAL CONTENT AND ALSO ENCOMPASSES A PLURALITY OF VALUES AND VIRTUES AT ITS CORE. AN ACCEPTABLE DEFINITION OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEMANDS OF A PUBLIC ETHOS, THE VIRTUES OF GOOD DECISION MAKING AND REASON GIVING, THE RULE OF LAW, EFFICIENCY, STABILITY, AND A PRINCIPLE OF BENEFICENCE. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THESE COMPONENTS IN DETAIL AND THE RELATIONS AMONG THEM.
788	THE GOVERNMENT OF LATVIA REGARDS THE SELECTION OF ITS CAPITAL, RIGA, AS THE SITE OF THE NATO SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN NOVEMBER 2006 AS A RECOGNITION OF ALL IT HAS ACHIEVED SINCE RECOVERING ITS FREEDOM FROM TOTALITARIAN RULE, INCLUDING DEVELOPING THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY IN EUROPE, DISPATCHING TROOPS TO SERVE ON THREE INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCES, ENDORSING THE CANDIDACY OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN STATES FORMEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND SUPPORTING THE EXTENSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE STRENGTHENING OF NATO. LATVIA CONSIDERS NATO AS THE REPOSITORY OF THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. DEDICATED TO THE REJUVENATION OF NATO, THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT OF MEMBER STATES INTEND, AT THE RIGA SUMMIT, TO RENEW THEIR EFFORTS TO FULFILL THE LONG-TERM GOAL OF TRANSFORMING NATO INTO AN INSTRUMENT FOR PEACE AND GOODWILL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.
789	ASUCCESSFUL POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION IS CHARACTERIZED BY A SELF- SUSTAINING LIBERAL POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ORDER THAT DOES NOT RELY ON EXTERNAL SUPPORT. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE EXTENT OF RECONSTRUCTED ORDERS IS CONSTRAINED BY THEIR INSTITUTIONAL PREREQUISITES. THESE PREREQUISITES-A SHARED IDEOLOGY AND ETHIC OF INDIVIDUAL AND PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, A COMMITMENT TO MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW-ARE FUNDAMENTAL. WITHOUT THESE PRECONDITIONS TO SERVE AS A FOUNDATION, RECONSTRUCTED LIBERAL ORDERS WILL FAIL TO BE SELF-SUSTAINING OVER TIME. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE VIABILITY OF A SHARED IDEOLOGY AND ETHIC, AND HENCE SUCCESS, IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXTENT OF HORIZONTAL TIES IN THE POST-CONFLICT COUNTRY. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT SOCIETIES LACKING ADEQUATE HORIZONTAL TIES WILL REQUIRE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONTINUAL INTERVENTION AND RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS WILL HAVE A LOWER PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS.
790	INEFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND LACK OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY FEATURES PROMINENTLY AS CRISES OF GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA. DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS COULD PLAY A ROLE IN REDUCING SUCH SOCIAL FACTORS AS A HIGH RATE OF ILLITERACY AND POVERTY. THIS, HOWEVER, IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF 'THE RULE OF LAW' PREVAILS AND IF CIVIL SOCIETY IS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN A POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SENSE. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE IS A CORNERSTONE OF RECONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 (ACT 108 OF 1996) AND THE RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (RDP) FORM THE FOUNDATION FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE. AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES IS MADE.
791	THIS PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH AN ANALYSIS OF LEGISLATION, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE DECISIONS ON POLICING ACTIVITIES. THESE THREE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNMENT CAN BE USED AS MECHANISMS OF SOCIAL CONTROL. WHETHER THEY ARE OR NOT IS AN EMPIRICAL QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE DETERMINED IN EACH CASE. IT IS SHOWN THAT THERE ARE NO STRICT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY: SEPARATE DECISION-MAKING IS UNDERTAKEN FOR EACH OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS. IT IS INDICATED THAT THERE ARE EIGHT POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS, ASSUMING THAT THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY ARE BIVARIATE AND DISCRETE. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS RELATES TO THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND AND IT IS CONCLUDED THAT QUEENSLAND CAN BE DESCRIBED AS A CASE CONSISTING OF AUTHORITARIAN LEGISLATION, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND LOW POLICING EXPENDITURES.
792	DOES THE RISE OF CONTRACT-INTENSIVE ECONOMIC STRUCTURES IN AN ECONOMY AFFECT POLITICAL NORMS AND PROMOTE DE-MOCRACY? IN THIS STUDY WE DELINEATE HOW THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURES OF COMMERCIAL CONTRACTING CAN YIELD THE IN-TERESTS, VALUES, AND OUTLOOKS THAT FAVOR THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS. ANALYSES OF MOST COUNTRIES FROM 1950 TO 2019 SHOW THAT THE INCREASE IN THE INTENSITY OF CONTRACT FLOWS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS A RANGE OF SPECIFICATIONS, MEASURES, CONTROL VARIABLES, AND WITH INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE REGRESSION TO CHECK FOR REVERSE CAUSALITY. A CHANGE FROM THE TENTH TO NINETIETH PERCENTILE IN THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF COMMERCIAL CONTRACTING CORRESPONDS WITH A SUBSTANTIAL 58 TO 105% IN-CREASE IN LOCAL AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT (LATE) ON DEMOCRACY IN THE LONG RUN, DEPENDING ON THE MEASURES EXAMINED.
793	LOWER STATE COURTS ARE THE FOCUS OF BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS BUT REMAIN UNDERSTUDIED IN UGANDA. DRAWING ON 3 YEARS OF ETHNOGRAPHICALLY INFORMED RESEARCH ON CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT WITH A BUSY MAGISTRATES' COURT IN POST-WAR NORTHERN UGANDA, WE SHOW THE DIVERSE REASONS WHY CITIZENS APPEAL TO THE RULE-OF-LAW IN PLACES WHERE STATE AUTHORITY IS CONTESTED. IN A CONTEXT OF LIMITED STATEHOOD, AGAINST A BACKDROP OF HIGH-LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AND INEFFICIENCY IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, PEOPLE TURN TO LOWER STATE COURTS FOR NORMATIVE, PRAGMATIC, AND TACTICAL REASONS THAT ARE NOT WELL CAPTURED BY CONVENTIONAL MEASURES OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE. OUR FINDINGS EXTEND THEORY ON CITIZEN-AUTHORITY RELATIONS IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT, SHEDDING LIGHT ON CONTEXTUAL MEANINGS OF LEGITIMACY, TRUST, AND CORRUPTION IN PLACES WHERE LOWER STATE COURTS ARE DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC SITES FOR ACHIEVING JUSTICE.
794	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATED THE INTERNATIONAL DIFFUSION OF UBER, ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING GLOBAL COMPANIES IN THE SHARING ECONOMY. WE PARTICULARLY FOCUS ON THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS RIDE-SHARING PLATFORM COULD SPREAD TO CUSTOMERS ONLINE. USING A UNIQUE CROSS-NATIONAL, LONGITUDINAL DATASET, WE EMPLOY EVENT HISTORY MODELS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE DIFFUSION OF UBER. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE SPREAD OF UBER, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS. IN ADDITION, THE OVERALL QUALITY OF GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS ON MARKETS IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE DIFFUSION OF THIS RIDE-SHARING PLATFORM. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMERGING LITERATURE ON THE SHARING ECONOMY BY IDENTIFYING CRITICAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS THAT ENABLE THE TRANSFORMATION OF BUSINESS MODELS WORLDWIDE.
795	THE PAPER ASKS WHETHER WALTER EUCKEN, THE FOUNDER OF GERMAN ORDOLIBERALISM, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE A PROPONENT OF AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM. THAT TERM ORIGINALLY REFERS TO A PROPOSAL FOR ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION ADVANCED BY CARL SCHMITT IN 1932. AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM ALSO COULD BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT EUCKEN FAVORS THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC FREEDOMS, BUT REJECTS DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING. BOTH POSSIBLE MEANINGS ARE CONSIDERED. WE SHOW THAT EUCKEN IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE OF AUTHORITARIAN LIBERALISM IN EITHER SENSE OF THE TERM. WHILE EUCKEN AND SCHMITT OFFER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ENTANGLEMENT OF STATE AND ECONOMY IN WEIMAR GERMANY, THEIR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS ARE RATHER DIFFERENT. WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND MEANING, WE ARGUE THAT EUCKEN'S CRITIQUE OF DEMOCRACY REFERS TO TWO UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED PROBLEMS OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING, NAMELY INTEREST GROUP INFLUENCE AND THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY.
796	STARTING FROM A CASE STUDY ON THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE DEAF TO THE LEGAL-POLITICAL DIMENSION, ON TV CHANNELS, THIS WORK AIMS TO PROBLEMATIZE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATION OF THIS MINORITY COMMUNITY, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE MOST RECENT SCENARIO, THROUGH INFORMATION (UN) ACCESSIBLE AIRED ON BROADCAST TV NEWS. THE EMPHASIS ON THE DEBATE BRINGS TO LIGHT THE LATEST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND THE PANDEMIC OF COVID-19, AMID FAKE NEWS. THE WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC MEDIA ON THE WEAKENING / STRENGTHENING OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, WITH THEORETICAL DIALOGUE IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF DIFFERENCE. THROUGH CARTOGRAPHY AS A METHODOLOGICAL RESOURCE, THE MAIN RESULT SHOWS THE ALTERNATIVE WAYS THESE GROUPS TEND TO CREATE AND PUBLICIZE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EVERYDAY CONTENT, AS A (RISKY) STRATEGY OF RES / EX-ISTENCE.
797	JAPAN HAS A NATIONAL INTEREST IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ISSUE. ALTHOUGH ITS DIRECT COMMITMENT IS ULTIMATELY LIMITED IN A MATERIAL SENSE DUE TO A LACK OF MILITARY CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE, JAPAN HAS MAINTAINED ITS FIRM STANCE TO UPHOLD INTERNATIONAL MARITIME RULES AND NORMS, AND NURTURED STRONG DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND CONDUCTED MARITIME CAPACITY-BUILDING PROGRAMS WITH THE SOUTH-EAST ASIAN STATES, AS WELL AS THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS. THESE ACTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO CONSOLIDATING THE RULE OF LAW AT SEA AND PROVIDE THOSE CLAIMANT STATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO WITHSTAND PRESSURES FROM CHINA. GIVEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S UNCLEAR SOUTH CHINA SEA POLICY AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA'S STRATEGIC UNCERTAINTY, JAPAN IS BECOMING A KEY PLAYER IN MAINTAINING REGIONAL MARITIME STABILITY IN EAST ASIA THROUGH DIPLOMACY.
798	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE FOUNDATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS, IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THE CURRENT PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHICH REQUIRE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A REASONABLE DECISION-MAKER COULD HAVE ARRIVED AT THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE REPOSITORY, WERE DEVELOPED AT A TIME WHEN DECISION-MAKERS WERE NOT REQUIRED TO GIVE REASONS, UNLIKE THE POSITION TODAY IN RESPECT OF MOST COMMONWEALTH DECISION-MAKERS. THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS WHETHER SUCH REASONS SHOULD BE EVIDENCE AS TO WHETHER THE DECISION-MAKER EXERCISED EXECUTIVE POWER UNREASONABLY. IT ASKS WHETHER THE WEDNESBURY RATIONALE FOR DECIDING WHETHER A DECISION FOR WHICH NO REASONS WERE GIVEN WAS UNREASONABLE, SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE USED WHEN REASONS ARE GIVEN. THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS WHETHER IT IS TIME TO RETHINK THIS ASPECT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AS AN ASPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
799	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC STANDARD BY WHICH THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS INTERPRETED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND THE RIGHT TO EXAMINE WITNESSES UNDER ARTICLE 6 ECHR, THE STANDARD OF OVERALL FAIRNESS. THE FIRST SECTION ARGUES THAT THE STANDARD OF OVERALL FAIRNESS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND REPRESENTS A PROBLEMATIC CONCEPTION OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. THE SECOND SECTION LINKS OVERALL FAIRNESS TO THE COURT'S WIDER METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ADJUDICATION, NAMELY AD HOC BALANCING, AND ESTABLISHES THAT AD HOC BALANCING IS VULNERABLE TO SIMILAR CRITIQUES. THE THIRD SECTION ADVOCATES FOR A LEGAL DOCTRINE WHICH REJECTS THE THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS OF BALANCING AND SETS THE BASIS FOR A RECONCEPTUALISATION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS' APPROACH TO METHODOLOGY AND TO THE GRANT OF REMEDIES.
800	OBJECTIVEIT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT GOOD INSTITUTIONS CAUSED MODERN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. BUT WHAT CAUSED GOOD INSTITUTIONS? IN THIS ARTICLE WE CHALLENGE RECENT EXPLANATIONS THAT FAVOR STATE CAPACITY, POINTING INSTEAD TO THE POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE. METHODSWE DEVELOP A NOVEL THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH WE CALL POLYCENTRIC SOVEREIGNTY, BASED ON POLITICAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE USE THIS THEORY TO REINTERPRET THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MEDIEVAL PATRIMONY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. RESULTSOUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THE DE FACTO BALANCE OF POWER AMONG THE OWNERS OF THE REALM IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE ARE CRUCIAL IN EXPLAINING THE RISE OF PRO-GROWTH INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT RESPECT AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. CONCLUSIONMEDIEVAL INSTITUTIONS SET THE BACKGROUND CONDITIONS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE. WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE BOUNTY OF ECONOMIC MODERNITY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE RECEIVED POLITICAL-ECONOMIC TRADITIONS FROM MEDIEVAL EUROPE.
801	THE 2018 CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN CHINA HAVE ATTRACTED STRONG CRITICISM BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD. THIS PAPER FIRST USES CONTEXTUAL, HISTORICAL, AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE THREE MAJOR AMENDMENTS ARE AS BAD AS WIDELY PERCEIVED, AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ACTUAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE IN CHINA. THE PAPER THEN ANALYSES HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS MAY CHALLENGE THE TWO EXISTING THEORIES ON CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WILL HAVE ANY PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE, THEY DO SEND OUT A VERY NEGATIVE SIGNAL, AND THAT THE TREND OF A CONSTITUTIONALISED FUSED SYSTEM DEMANDS AT LEAST REVISION OF THE EXISTING THEORIES AND POSSIBLY A NEW THEORY, FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOT ONLY JUSTIFYING CHINESE CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE BUT ALSO LEADING CHINA TOWARDS AT LEAST A THIN RULE OF LAW.
802	AS IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER A PERIOD OF MANY DECADES, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS ACQUIRED ITS OWN MORALITY. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MORALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PUTS CONTEMPORARY CRITICISMS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN THEIR MOST PLAUSIBLE LIGHT. REFLECTED IN A WIDE ARRAY OF SEEMINGLY DISPARATE DOCTRINES, BUT NOT YET RECOGNIZED AS SUCH, THE MORALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW INCLUDES A SET OF IDENTIFIABLE PRINCIPLES, OFTEN SAID TO REFLECT THE CENTRAL INGREDIENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. CLOSELY RELATED TO WHAT PROFESSOR LON FULLER DESCRIBED AS THE INTERNAL MORALITY OF LAW, THE RESULTING DOCTRINES DO NOT DESERVE AN UNAMBIGUOUS CELEBRATION, BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE AN AMBIGUOUS LEGAL SOURCE; BECAUSE FROM THE WELFARIST POINT OF VIEW, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THEY ARE ALWAYS GOOD IDEAS; AND BECAUSE IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT JUDGES SHOULD ENFORCE THEM.
803	"ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" IS THE FORMULA UNDER WHICH HONG KONG REVERTED TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY IN 1997. EMBODIED IN HONG KONG'S BASIC LAW, IT FORMALLY PROVIDES FOR AN UNCHANGED SYSTEM AND A HIGH DEGREE OF AUTONOMY IN MOST MATTERS OTHER THAN DEFENCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. SINCE THE HONG KONG PEOPLE DID NOT EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE REVERSION TO CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY, "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" BECAME DE FACTO A LEGITIMATING IDEOLOGY. HOWEVER, IT IS INTERPRETED IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SEES IT AS A POLICY DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE HONG KONG INTO CHINA. FOR MANY HONG KONG PEOPLE, IT IS A CONTRACT GUARANTEEING A HIGH DEGREE OF LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE AUTONOMY, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW, CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND PROGRESS TOWARDS A MORE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE TENSIONS ARISING FROM THESE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.
804	ADVOCACY NGOS IN CROATIA OFTEN EMPHASIZE THEIR NONPARTISAN IDENTITY, MEANING THAT THEY DO NOT PUBLICLY ASSOCIATE WITH POLITICAL PARTIES OR DECLARE THEIR ENDORSEMENT OF ELECTORAL CANDIDATES. WHILE SUCH NGOS' BEHAVIOR COULD BE EXPLAINED BASED ON OVERALL NEGATIVE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL PARTIES, AS WELL AS FUNDING CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY NGOS' DONORS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CONTINUOUS NONPARTISAN IDENTITY OF ADVOCACY NGOS IS FURTHER REAFFIRMED BY A SPECIFIC CIVIL SOCIETY DISCOURSE. DRAWING ON THE ANALYSIS OF IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH SENIOR MEMBERS OF NINE CROATIAN NGOS, ACTIVE IN AREAS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND EDUCATION, THREE RELEVANT THEMES OF CIVIL SOCIETY DISCOURSE REAFFIRMING NGOS' NONPARTISANSHIP ARE OUTLINED: (1) IDEA OF CIVIL SOCIETY AS AN ANSWER TO MALFUNCTIONING STATE, (2) NGOS' LEGITIMATION BASED ON AUTONOMY AND EXPERTISE, AND (3) PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL PARTIES AS AN INHERENTLY LIMITING ORGANIZATIONAL FORM.
805	SEVERAL STUDIES INVESTIGATE THE MEANINGS OF DEMOCRACY AMONG THE ADULT POPULATION. IN CONTRAST, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT YOUNG CITIZENS' IDEAS OF DEMOCRACY, AND WHICH INDIVIDUAL AND CONTEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY UNCOVERING THE MEANINGS OF DEMOCRACY AND THEIR CORRELATES AMONG ADOLESCENTS IN 38 COUNTRIES. USING THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIC AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION STUDY 2009, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT MEANINGS OF DEMOCRACY VARY AMONG ADOLESCENTS. THESE MEANINGS ARE THE RESULTS OF HOW ADOLESCENTS FIND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY, AS THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOMS, RIGHTS, PLURALISM, OR EQUALITY, CONSTITUTIVE OF IT. THEN, THE ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER SOCIALIZATION AGENTS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF DEMOCRACY TO ADOLESCENTS. FINALLY, THE ANALYSIS ADDRESSES THE ROLE THAT LARGER CONTEXTS-DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT-HAVE IN THE FORMATION OF CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AMONG ADOLESCENTS.
806	THIS ARTICLE IS A RESPONSE TO TWO CRUCIAL IDEAS ABOUT PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE: THE FIRST IS J. FAGG FOSTER'S PRINCIPLE OF "MINIMAL SOCIAL DISLOCATION," WHICH ASSERTS THAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED GRADUALLY, TO AVOID UNRAVELING THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY; THE SECOND IS KARL POLANYI'S PRINCIPLES OF REDISTRIBUTION OF RIGHTS AND POWERS BY RELEVANT AUTHORITIES AND RECIPROCITY, A SYMMETRICAL AND HIGHLY PERSONALIZED EXCHANGE SYSTEM, WHICH IS LIKEWISE A PROTECTIVE MECHANISM THAT SOCIETY EMPLOYS AGAINST ANONYMITY AND DISINTEGRATION BROUGHT ABOUT BY UNREGULATED MARKET. USING LESSONS LEARNED IN THE THIRTY-YEAR TRANSITION TO MARKET IN POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT TO COMMENCE PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE HONESTY- AND TRANSPARENCYRESISTANT CULTURES OF FORMER SOVIET STATES, IMPERSONAL EXCHANGE AND IMPARTIAL RULE OF LAW MUST BE GIVEN FAR GREATER WEIGHT THAN PERSONALIZATION OF CONTACTS AND CONTINUATION OF CULTURAL TRADITIONS.
807	WITH THIS CONFERENCE I WANT TO SHARE THOSE KNOWLEDGE, EXPERIENCES AND DESIRES THAT, AFTER A LONG LIFE OF PROFESSOR OF THEORY AND METHODOLOGY OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH AT THE COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID. KNOWLEDGE OFFERED BY 40 YEARS OF TEACHER AND RESEARCHER IN COMMUNICATION. EXPERIENCES LIVED THANKS TO THE APPROACH AND OFTEN THE EXERCISE OF JOURNALIST AND EDITOR. DESIRES, FINALLY, FOSTERED FROM MY STATUS AS A COMMITTED CITIZEN AS A BASE MILITANT IN LEFT-WING PARTIES DURING A PERIOD DURING WHICH SPAIN LEAVES A DICTATORSHIP AND ESTABLISHES A SOLID DEMOCRACY. AND ABOUT ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE, (1. THE ROLE OF THE ACADEMY AGAINST THE NOTIONS OF TRUTH), PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES (2. JOURNALISM AND POST-TRUTH) AND CITIZEN DESIRES (3. NEW COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN THE RULE OF LAW) REVOLVE PRECISELY THE THEMATIC AXES OF THIS CONGRESS. I ASSUME THEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE AXES TO ARTICULATE MY SPEECH.
808	THE LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN (LAC) REGION HAS A SIZABLE INFRASTRUCTURE GAP. PHYSICAL ASSETS, MAINTENANCE, AND SERVICE PROVISION ARE INADEQUATE AND BELOW AVERAGE FOR A REGION AT ITS LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. THE MOST PROMISING WAY TO DOSE THE SERVICE GAP IS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY. RELYING ON DATA ON MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES FOR 2000 AND 2016, THIS PAPER INNOVATES BY 1) DEVELOPING A SINGLE ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE INDEX TO COMPARE COUNTRIES; 2) PRESENTING AN EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS THAT ASSESSES WHETHER LAC COUNTRIES HAVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE PROVISION OF THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE; 3) PROPOSING A NOVEL PEER-IDENTIFICATION CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY WHICH COUNTRIES ARE THE RELEVANT BENCHMARKS FOR THE REGION; AND 4) PROVIDING EVIDENCE ON HOW SOUND GOVERNANCE, REGULATION, RULE OF LAW, AND THE LACK OF CORRUPTION ARE RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE EFFICIENCY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL.
809	THE ORGANISATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE IS IN A SEVERE CRISIS. AFTER THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANISATION, THE OSCE SUSPENDED WORK IN EAST CENTRAL EUROPE. IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE, THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF OSCE ACTIVITY IN THE 1990S, THE ORGANISATION IS INCREASINGLY BEING REPLACED BY THE EU. THE OSCE HAS FAILED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ITS ACTIVITIES IN THE POST-SOVIET REALM. MANY WESTERN STATES MAY WISH FOR SUCH AN EXPANSION OF ACTIVITY, BUT THE OVERWHELMINGLY AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES OF THE POST-SOVIET REALM SEE THIS AS UNWANTED INTERFERENCE. THUS, THE OSCE HAS TO WAIT FOR A NEW GREAT MOMENT, A SECOND WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC UPHEAVALS, BEFORE IT CAN AGAIN CHAMPION THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW AS DECLARED IN THE CHARTER OF PARIS FOR A NEW EUROPE.
810	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGES IN KOREA, NOT ONLY FOR THE WAY THE COUNTRY IS GOVERNED, BUT ALSO THE WAY IN WHICH ITS PEOPLE LEAD THEIR LIVES. INSTITUTIONALLY, THE FIRST DECADE OF DEMOCRATIZATION FULLY TRANSFORMED A MILITARY DICTATORSHIP INTO A FUNCTIONING REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. PROCEDURALLY, IT REDIRECTED THE GOAL OF POLICYMAKING TOWARD THE PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE, SOCIAL WELFARE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. SUBSTANTIVELY, DEMOCRATIC REFORMS EXPANDED POLITICAL FREEDOM AND REINVIGORATED CIVIL SOCIETY. AS IN THE AUTHORITARIAN PAST, HOWEVER, THE COUNTRY STILL SUFFERS FROM THE IMBALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND A NEED FOR A PROPER RESTRAINT ON EXECUTIVE POWER. AS A RESULT, THE KOREAN PEOPLE, AS A WHOLE, REMAIN MORE DISSATISFIED THAN SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE PERFORMS.
811	RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN RESEARCH ON ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCH ON LA IV. ONE GOAL OF SUCH RESEARCH IS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE STRUCTURES OF COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS AND THE NORMATIVE AND COGNITIVE STRUCTURES OF LAW INTERACT WITHIN DIFFERENT CULTURES. THIS ARTICLE IS PART OF THAT ENTERPRISE. WE REPORT RESULTS FROM SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN MOSCOW, TOKYO, AND WASHINGTON IN 1993 THAT ASKED RESPONDENTS TO JUDGE ACTS OF WRONGDOING WITHIN CORPORATE HIERARCHIES AND THEN ASKED THEM TO PROPOSE SANCTIONS FOR THE WRONGDOERS. MOST IMPORTANT, RESPONDENTS' VIEWS OF SANCTIONING REFLECT CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN CONCEPTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE ORGANIZATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE DISCUSSION LOCATES THIS RESEARCH WITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF NORMATIVE-CULTURAL APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF ORGANIZATIONS AND INDICATES HOW THIS RESEARCH TRADITION CAN BE ENRICHED BY STUDYING THE ATTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY.
812	IN THE WAKE OF CRISES AND "ENLARGEMENT FATIGUE", EU POLITICS DEPRIORITIZED ENLARGEMENT. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE COMMISSION MOTIONED A REINVIGORATED ENLARGEMENT PROSPECT FOR THE WESTERN BALKANS, IDENTIFYING SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO AS THE FRONT RUNNERS. THIS PAPER ADVISES THAT IN GOING FORWARD, THE EU SHOULD ALSO LOOK BACK AT ITS FIVE DECADES OF ENLARGEMENT. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION - A KEY EU PUBLIC POLICY - AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT FEATURES IN THE EVER-EVOLVING ACCESSION CONDITIONS AND ACCESSION ACTS. IT EMERGES THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAS BEEN MARGINALIZED THROUGHOUT EU'S ENLARGEMENT HISTORY. TAKING SERBIA AS A CASE STUDY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THIS IS HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC, SINCE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS LINKED TO SAFEGUARDING THE RULE OF LAW AN ESSENTIAL CRITERION FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN THE EU'S ENLARGEMENT POLICIES SHOULD THUS BE REPRIORITIZED.
813	DESPITE SIMPLIFICATION ATTEMPTS IN THE PAST, AUSTRALIA'S TAXATION SYSTEM REMAINS IN A STATE OF SEVERE COMPLEXITY, WHICH STEMS FROM THE VOLUME AND CONTENT OF LEGISLATION. THOUGH NOT ALWAYS DAMAGING - AND INDEED SOMETIMES NECESSARY - THE VOLUME OF LEGISLATION IS NOW UNDENIABLY EXCESSIVE. THE CONTENT ITSELF IS RIDDLED WITH CONFUSION. EVEN DEFINITIONS MAY BE MARRED BY DEEMING PROVISIONS; REVERSE DEEMING PROVISIONS; AND SINGLE, DOUBLE AND EVEN TRIPLE NEGATIVES. THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF COMPLEXITY ARE LEADING TO AN ESCALATING COST OF COMPLIANCE AND AN EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. A SERIES OF CASES SINCE ESSENBOURNE V FCT DEMONSTRATES THE POSSIBLE DANGERS: HOW CERTAIN TAXPAYERS MAY NOW HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE VERY OPPOSING VIEWS OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER AND THE JUDICIARY. AS WELL AS THESE BURDENS, STUDIES SHOW THAT EVEN TAX PRACTITIONERS ARE LOSING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE SYSTEM.
814	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL REGULATIONS ON PRACTICING RELIGION INTRO-DUCED IN POLAND WITH RESPECT TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE LEGAL ANALYSIS JUXTAPOSES THESE RULES WITH FREEDOM OF RELIGION, THE RULE OF LAW (INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPER LEGISLATION) AND THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY. A SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS, BASED ON IM AND CALAI RESEARCH, EXPLAINS THE RESPONSE OF POLISH SOCIETY, SPECIFICALLY BELIEVERS, TO THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED ON THE BASIS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE REGULATIONS STRONGLY VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLES UNDER SCRUTINY. HOWEVER, IN GENERAL, POLISH SOCIETY DID NOT QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF THE RESTRICTIONS. SOCIAL CRITI-CISM CENTERED ON SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY MEANS OF REGULATIONS, THEIR QUESTION-ABLE NATURE, AND DIFFICULTIES WITH THEIR APPLICATION, WHILE THE CRITICISM DID NOT EXPRESS DOUBTS OF A LEGAL NATURE.
815	THE USE OF DECEPTION AND DISHONESTY IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A FACT OF LIFE IN POLICING. THIS PAPER THUS DEFENDS A COUNTERINTUITIVE CLAIM: GOOD FAITH IS A NORMATIVE FOUNDATION FOR THE POLICE AS A POLITICAL INSTITUTION. GOOD FAITH IS A CORE VALUE OF CONTRACTS, AND POLICING IS CONTRACTUAL IN NATURE BOTH BROADLY (AS A MATTER OF SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY) AND NARROWLY (IN REGARD TO CONCRETE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC). GIVEN THE CENTRALITY OF GOOD FAITH TO POLICING, DISHONESTY AND DECEPTION ON PAR WITH FRAUD ARE JUSTIFIED ONLY AS A NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED INVESTIGATIVE TOOL THAT IS CONSTRAINED BY INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENTS TO THE FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRACTICAL UPSHOT IS THE PRECLUSION OF MOST DISHONEST AND DECEPTIVE POLICE TACTICS ON PAR WITH FRAUD, LEADING TO AN INSTITUTION THAT IS LESS PROACTIVE AND MORE REACTIVE.
816	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED MANY COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN USING DATA AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP RESOLVE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. THESE COMPLEXITIES HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO EMBRACE A BROADER FRAMEWORK OF DATA GOVERNANCE WITH THREE FOUNDATIONAL QUESTIONS: (A) WHO DECIDES ABOUT DATA FLOWS, (B) ON WHAT BASIS, AND (C) WITH WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. THESE QUESTIONS CAN ACCOMMODATE THE ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING NEW TYPES OF DATA HARMS. HOWEVER, THESE QUESTIONS ALSO FOREGROUND IMPORTANT ISSUES OF POWER, AUTHORITY, AND LEGITIMACY. DATA GOVERNANCE CAN PROVIDE AN ORGANIZING NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS EMERGING DATA THEMES INCLUDING ACCESS TO DATA, COLLECTIVE DECISION MAKING, DATA INTERMEDIARIES, DATA SOVEREIGNTY, DESIGN AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, REGULATORY TECHNOLOGIES, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SOCIAL TRUST AND LICENSE. THE PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE WITH CONTACT TRACING APPS, IN PARTICULAR, SHOWED THE MANY UNRESOLVED GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES.
817	CRITICAL SCHOLARSHIP ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, IN AFRICA AND GLOBALLY, HAS DRAWN ATTENTION TO BOTH LIBERALISM AND LEGALISM (SUCH AS INATTENTION TO STRUCTURAL INJUSTICES), AND TO NORMATIVELY, MORE EXPANSIVE - TRANSFORMATIVE, AND EVEN REVOLUTIONARY - APPROACHES TO JUSTICE. FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON SOUTH AFRICA, THIS DEBATE PIECE CONSIDERS THE ROLES OF LIBERAL PROPERTY RELATIONS AND CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN PRODUCING AND MAINTAINING INJUSTICES RELATED TO LAND AND PROPERTY IN (POST-)TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES IN AFRICA AND BEYOND. MOREOVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO REVOLUTIONARY ASPIRATIONS OF OVERCOMING CAPITALIST SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS (AS ESPOUSED, AT LEAST RHETORICALLY, BY LIBERATION MOVEMENTS THROUGHOUT AFRICA) IS CONSIDERED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT WHILE THIS IS UNLIKELY, NON-REFORMIST REFORMS OFFER ONE AVENUE BY WHICH MORE EXPANSIVE (TRANSFORMATIVE OR REVOLUTIONARY) GOALS MIGHT BE PURSUED, IN PART, IN AND THROUGH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
818	THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE IMPACT OF THE ECHR AND THE CASE LAW OF THE ECTHR ON CIVIL PROCEDURE IN UKRAINE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROVISIONS OF. NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND JUDICIAL PRACTICE, THE AUTHORS ANALYSE THE AREAS OF THE HARMONIZATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ECHR AND THE PRACTICE OF THE ECTHR IN LIGHT OF THE 2016 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF JUSTICE AND THE NEW EDITION OF THE CIVIL PROCEDURE CODE OF UKRAINE. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE EMBODIMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE DURING A TRIAL INN CIVIL CASES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL (PARA. I ART. 6 OF THE ECHR). FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ECTHR AND NATIONAL COURTS, THE PROCEDURES OF PILOT JUDGMENTS, THE REVIEW OF THE CASE IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WAS ANALYSED.
819	THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL CRISES ON THE EMERGING FINANCIAL MARKETS OF EASTERN EUROPE GREW STRONGER DUE TO A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND LOW MARKET EFFICIENCY. FOR THIS REASON, OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY MEASURES WITH CORRELATION TO LIQUIDITY AND VOLATILITY TO GAUGE STOCK PRICE REACTION DURING TWO FINANCIAL CRISES PERIODS. OUR FINDINGS REVEALED A VERY CHAOTIC PICTURE OF THE MARKET AND THE PRESENCE OF UNCONTROLLED DEVELOPMENT. AS IT TURNED OUT, EASTERN EUROPEAN FINANCIAL MARKETS DID NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING TRANSPARENCY, LIQUIDITY AND RISK. HENCE, IT CALLS INTO QUESTION THE SOUNDNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH RAISES DOUBTS AMONG INVESTORS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TEND NOT TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY TRANSPARENCY, WHICH LEADS TO LIMITED MARKET INFORMATION AND A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF LOW-LEVEL STOCK MARKET EFFICIENCY IN TERMS OF THE FAMA APPROACH.
820	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE INFLUENCE OF COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE ON AUDITING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS. WE HAVE USED THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS DEVELOPED BY WORLD BANK AS PROXIES FOR COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE. USING A CROSS-SECTIONAL SAMPLE OF 396 YEARS OBSERVATIONS COVERING 132 COUNTRIES OVER 2009-2011, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE STRENGTH OF AUDITING AND REPORTING STANDARDS (SARS). THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FACTORS FOR SARS. THE AIM IS TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT SCHOLARS TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE COMPLEX OF DETERMINANT FACTORS ON SARS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON STANDARDS-SETTING PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE ALSO PROPOSES A CROSS-COUNTRY EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF LEGAL ENVIRONMENT FACTORS ON AUDITING AND REPORTING STANDARDS.
821	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SIX INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MEASURES, NAMELY CORRUPTION CONTROL, EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, IN INHIBITING SELF-REWARDING BEHAVIOUR OF BOARDS IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPENSATION AS WELL AS IN INFLUENCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF DISCLOSURE OF INDIVIDUAL EXECUTIVE SALARIES IN IPO LISTINGSPROSPECTUSES. USING A UNIQUE AND COMPREHENSIVE DATASET OF 78 HAND-COLLECTED IPO FIRMS FROM ACROSS NORTH AFRICA FROM 2000 TO 2012 I FIND SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND CORRUPTION CONTROL ARE IMPORTANT IN INHIBITING DIRECTOR SELF-REWARDAND EXPROPRIATION WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY IS MORE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LIKELIHOOD OF TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING OF SALARIES. IN ADDITION FIRMS FROM POOR INFORMATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO INITIATE ENHANCED SELF-GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY SO AS TO OVERCOME INSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
822	THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT - THE LEGISLATURE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY - ARE PARTNERS IN THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING SUSTAINABILITY. EACH CAN PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE, CONSISTENT WITH THEIR FUNCTIONS. THE JUDICIARY'S PRIMARY LEADERSHIP ROLE IS IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS CENTRAL FUNCTION OF JUDGING DISPUTES. THIS INVOLVES FINDING, INTERPRETING AND APPLYING THE LAW. EACH STEP PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO EXHIBIT LEADERSHIP IN ATTAINING SUSTAINABILITY. THE JUDICIARY PROTECTS AND UPHOLDS THE RULE OF LAW. THIS INCLUDES UPHOLDING LAWS THAT ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS WAY, COURTS ENSURE GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE JUDICIARY CAN FACILITATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, INCLUDING ACCESS TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. COURTS CAN ALSO FACILITATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY EQUITABLE, EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE COURT ADMINISTRATION. FINALLY, THE JUDICIARY CAN PROVIDE LEADERSHIP THROUGH REASONED DECISIONS IN MERITS REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AND CONDUCT, EXPLICATING AND UPHOLDING PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
823	THIS PAPER PRESENTS THREE SURVEYS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF RELIGIOSITY AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGY ON LEGAL DISOBEDIENCE AMONG ISRAELI CITIZENS. IN ADDITION TO SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL JEWISH POPULATION (N = 1,728), THE SURVEYS INCLUDED SAMPLES OF THREE GROUPS CHARACTERIZED BY A COMBINATION OF RELIGIOSITY AND RIGHT-WING POLITICAL ORIENTATION: YESHIVA (RELIGIOUS SEMINARY) STUDENTS (N = 464), ULTRA-ORTHODOX JEWS (N = 217), AND SETTLERS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (N = 361). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAKER AMONG ULTRA-ORTHODOX AND RIGHT-WING RESPONDENTS. FURTHERMORE, COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION OF JEWS, YESHIVA STUDENTS AND ULTRA-ORTHODOX JEWS EXPRESSED LOWER LEVELS OF COMMITMENT TO LEGAL OBEDIENCE. COMPARISON OF ATTITUDES BEFORE AND AFTER THE OCCURRENCE OF CONTROVERSIAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL EVENTS INDICATED THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE A GENERALIZED EFFECT ON LEGAL OBEDIENCE.
824	WIDESPREAD COURT-GOVERNMENT INTERACTION OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS CHALLENGES THE CONVENTIONAL VIEW THAT SUCH INTERACTION SHOULD BE BANNED IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION. INDEED, UNDERPINNING INSTITUTIONS ENABLE COURTS AND GOVERNMENTS TO COORDINATE AND COOPERATE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ADDITION, FIRST-HAND LITIGATION MATERIALS DEMONSTRATE THAT COURT-GOVERNMENT INTERACTION HAS YIELDED SOME BENEFITS REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ALLEVIATE JUDICIAL UNFAIRNESS AND TO REALISE AN OUTCOME WHEREBY THE PROS OUTWEIGH THE CONS, EX PARTE COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE PROHIBITED, WHILE OTHER FORMS OF COURT-GOVERNMENT INTERACTION SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. DRAWING ON THE LESSONS FROM COURT-GOVERNMENT INTERACTION IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION IN GENERAL, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT BENIGN INTERACTION BETWEEN COURTS AND COMPETITION AGENCIES COULD ENHANCE COMPETITION ENFORCEMENT. THE AUTHOR DEDUCES FROM THE FINDINGS THAT CHINA FOLLOWS ITS OWN PATH ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH EXHIBITS ITS OWN CHARACTERISTICS.
825	USING EXAMPLES FROM THE LATE 19TH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT, IT WILL BE DISCUSSED TO WHAT EXTENT ANTI-SEMITISM WAS SHAPED BY A "LEGAL CODE". THE PRESSURE OF LEGAL REPRESSION, HOWEVER WEAK IT MAY HAVE BEEN AT TIMES, CAUSED ANTI-SEMITES TO RETREAT TO LANGUAGE FORMULAS THAT WERE NO LONGER (OR NOT YET) LEGALLY OBJECTIONABLE, WITHOUT THEREFORE GIVING UP THEIR CONVICTIONS. THIS BORDERLINE IS FUNDAMENTALLY SEMANTICALLY INDETERMINABLE, BECAUSE ASSOCIATIONS, PUNS AND CYNICISM CANNOT BE BANNED. THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS OFTEN COME TO NOTHING, BECAUSE A JUDICIARY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW MAY ONLY SANCTION DEEDS, NOT THOUGHTS. EACH JUDGEMENT INEVITABLY REDEFINES THIS BORDERLINE, AT LEAST IN NUANCES. BY CONTRIBUTING IN THIS WAY TO CONSTITUTING THE DISCURSIVE FRAMEWORK OF ANTI-SEMITISM, EVEN IF THERE IS A BROAD SOCIAL CONSENSUS OF ITS OSTRACISM, THE LAW IS BOTH A PARTIAL SOLUTION AND PART OF THE PROBLEM.
826	IN SPITE OF GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IS CENTRAL TO PROPERLY FUNCTIONING ECONOMIES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE COST OF LAW AND ORDER BREAKDOWNS. THIS PAPER STUDIES A SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF THIS BY ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF SOMALI PIRACY ATTACKS ON SHIPPING COSTS USING DATA ON SHIPPING CONTRACTS IN THE DRY BULK MARKET. TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF PIRACY, WE LOOK AT SHIPPING ROUTES WHOSE SHORTEST PATH EXPOSES THEM TO PIRACY AND FIND THAT THE INCREASE IN ATTACKS IN 2008 LED TO AROUND AN 8% TO 12% INCREASE IN COSTS. FROM THIS WE CALCULATE THE WELFARE LOSS IMPOSED BY PIRACY. WE ESTIMATE THAT GENERATING AROUND 120 USD MILLION OF REVENUE FOR SOMALI PIRATES LED TO A WELFARE LOSS IN EXCESS OF 630 USD MILLION, MAKING PIRACY AN EXPENSIVE WAY OF MAKING TRANSFERS.
827	E-GOVERNMENT HAS GREAT ADVANTAGES COMPARED WITH THE PRACTICE OF TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENT. THESE INCLUDED IMPROVING ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, REINFORCING OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY OF GOVERNMENTAL BEHAVIOUR. THE ADVANTAGES ALSO RELATE TO INCREASING THE CITIZENS' TRUST AND SATISFACTION WITH GOVERNMENT, CRACKING DOWN CORRUPTION AND PROMOTING RULE OF LAW. THIS RESEARCH ARGUES THAT E-GOVERNMENT OF CHINA IS LAGGED BEHIND THAT OF MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR THIS LAG IS THAT IT IS HELD UP BY INFLEXIBLE GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS INSTEAD OF SHORTAGE OF CAPITAL, TECHNOLOGIES AND TALENTS. THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT CHINA SHOULD START BY PERFORMING THE WTO'S TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLE TO FULLY IMPLEMENT DISCLOSURE OF THE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION. IT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE FRIENDLINESS, CONVENIENCE, TRANSPARENCY AND INEXPENSIVENESS AS THE VALUE ORIENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT. THE ARTICLE ALSO ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF E-GOVERNMENT.
828	THIS IS A LEGAL ANALYSIS TO DETECT ALL RELEVANT ELEMENTS THAT HAVE LED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EUROPEAN TRADE MARKET FOR CO2 EMISSION QUOTAS. THE FIRST ELEMENTS ARE THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL. THIS IS ONE OF THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED BY THE EU TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE. A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN GENERATED BUT ALSO SUCCESSES. THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE INFLUENCED THE RULE OF LAW ARE ALSO ANALYZED AS PART OF THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THIS MARKET. IN THIS SENSE, IT IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIED INTERESTS OF STATES, IN ITS ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, BUT ALSO POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ETC., UNDER THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY. PARTICULARLY THEIR NATIONAL ALLOCATION PLANS. THE LEGAL INTERESTS OF SOME ACTORS, ESPECIALLY CORPORATIONS ARE ALSO ANALYZED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IN PARTICULAR THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU IN THE FIELD.
829	DEALING WITH THE PAST IS REGARDED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL TASK FOR THE FULL-FLEDGED DEMOCRACY OF EMERGING DEMOCRACIES. THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO HEAL DIVISIONS IN SOCIETY, TO BRING CLOSURE AND HEAL THE WOUNDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY, TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO VICTIMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PERPETRATORS, TO CREATE AN ACCURATE HISTORICAL RECORD FOR A SOCIETY, TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW, TO PROMOTE DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AND FINALLY TO PROMOTE CO-EXISTENCE AND SUSTAINABLE PEACE. FROM THESE POINTS OF VIEW, I TRY TO COMPARE THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CZECH AND KOREAN CASE. ALTHOUGH BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE PAST, THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES. WHAT MAKES DIFFERENCES IN THE CAUSES, PROCESSES AND THE OUTCOMES BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER.
830	WHEN A MORE PEACEFUL SOUTHERN AFRICA OPENED UP TO THE WORLD IN THE 1990S, IT BECAME A TRANSIT HUB AND CONSUMER MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL FLOWS OF ILLEGAL DRUGS. THIS SEEMS PARADOXICAL, FOR THE DRUG PHENOMENON, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING REGIONS, IS FREQUENTLY DEPICTED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES - WAR, THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, OR CONVERSELY, THE RULE OF SOME DICTATORIAL OR OPPRESSIVE REGIME. HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THIS BOOM IN DRUG ACTIVITIES AFTER "NORMALISATION" ALLOWED SOUTHERN AFRICA TO LINK WITH GLOBAL MOVEMENTS, AND NOT WHEN IT WAS PREY TO INSTITUTIONALISED RACISM AND WAR? THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE ELEMENTS FOR AN ANSWER, BY SUGGESTING THAT, AT PRESENT, DRUG ACTIVITIES ARE ONE OF THE MODES IN WHICH SUBSTANTIAL, HISTORICAL, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS ARE EXPRESSED AND REPRODUCED WITHIN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND BETWEEN IT AND THE REST OF THE WORLD.
831	IN LATIN AMERICA, THE DRAFTERS OF EARLY NINETEENTH-CENTURY CONSTITUTIONS WERE SKEPTICAL OF IMPLEMENTING REPUBLICAN FORMS OF GOVERNMENT. AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, URUGUAY BECAME AN EXCEPTION BY BUCKING THIS LEGACY. UNDER THE SWISS-EDUCATED REFORMIST JOSE BATLLE Y ORDONEZ (1856-1929), THE GROUNDWORK WAS LAID FOR A NEW CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT A SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. INDEED, THE 1918 CONSTITUTION REPLACED A CONSERVATIVE AND CENTRALIST CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM WITH A PLURAL EXECUTIVE AND A REGIME OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A NEW INTERPRETATION OF BATLLISTA URUGUAY'S DISTINCTIVE INSTITUTIONS AND ARGUES THAT, DESPITE THE 1918 CONSTITUTION'S BRIEF ENDURANCE, URUGUAY'S DISTINCTLY REPUBLICAN FORM OF DEMOCRACY HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL ENTRENCHMENT BY VIRTUE OF ITS HAVING HELPED TO CREATE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY.
832	POST-COMMUNIST CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN LEGAL CULTURES IN GENERAL, AND JUDICIAL STYLE IN PARTICULAR, ARE OFTEN CHARACTERIZED AS FORMALISTIC. THIS ARTICLE RECONSTRUCTS TWO IDEOLOGICAL NARRATIVES ABOUT THE FORMALIST HERITAGE OF CEE JUDICIARY, VARIANTS OF WHICH HAVE DOMINATED ACADEMIC AND POLICY DEBATES ABOUT RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL REFORMS AND EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IN THE LAST THREE DECADES. AS THE DEBATE BECOMES LINKED TO DEEPLY ROOTED AND LONG-TERM, SOMETIMES TRAUMATIC ISSUES OF NATIONAL AND POLITICAL IDENTITY, PATTERNS OF IDEOLOGICAL THINKING RESURFACE EASILY. WHILE IT IS SYMPTOMATIC OF CEE POLITICAL CULTURES THAT THE DEBATE ON JUDICIAL METHOD HAS BECOME A BATTLEGROUND FOR FIERCE CONTROVERSIES ABOUT COLLECTIVE (POLITICAL) IDENTITY, ARGUABLY THIS EXEMPLIFIES A BROADER PHENOMENON. OTHER WEAK OR PERIPHERAL NATIONAL CULTURES ALSO FACE AND STRUGGLE WITH ISSUES OF COLLECTIVE IDENTITY AND INFERIORITY COMPLEXES WHICH MAY RESURFACE IN PROFESSIONAL DISCOURSES AND SEEMINGLY UNPOLITICAL DOMAINS.
833	DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S MODEST ROLE IN TAKING CARE OF AGING ADULTS, AS WELL AS A RAPIDLY AGING DEMOGRAPHIC AND A HIGH SHARE OF HOME OWNERSHIP, CROATIA IS AN INTERESTING CASE FOR PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) FINANCING. THIS STUDY USES A QUALITATIVE SURVEY THROUGH INTERVIEWS (N = 21) WITH SPECIALISTS FROM THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY TO EXAMINE THE PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPING LTC INSURANCE (LTCI) AND REVERSE MORTGAGES. THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSTACLES TO DEVELOPING REVERSE MORTGAGES AND LTCI ARE AN EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO REAL ESTATE AND STRONG FAMILY TIES. HOWEVER, INADEQUATELY REGULATED AND NONTRANSPARENT HOUSING AND LTC MARKETS, THE WEAK RULE OF LAW, POOR FINANCIAL LITERACY, LOW TRUST IN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THE PERCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT AS THE SAVIOR OF LAST RESORT POSE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES. COMBINED INSURANCE PRODUCTS WITH CLEARLY DEFINED BENEFITS ARE THE PRODUCTS SHOWING THE MOST MARKET POTENTIAL.
834	THIS PAPER STARTS FROM THE APPLICATION TO LATIN AMERICA OF AN ANALYTICAL TOOL THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACIES AND IS BASED ON THE THREE NOTIONS OF QUALITY, IN TERMS PROCEDURES (RULE OF LAW, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION AND POLITICAL COMPETITION), CONTENT (FREEDOM AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EQUALITY), AND RESULT (RESPONSIVENESS). IT TAKES IN FULL CONSIDERATION THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH OF THE AUTHOR ON THE AREA, AND UNDERLINES BOTH THE MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS THAT THE EMPIRICAL WORK HAS BROUGHT OUT AND THE MOST APPROPRIATE POLICIES THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF THOSE COUNTRIES. OBVIOUSLY, THE ABSENCE, PARTIAL OR COMPLETE, OF THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS TO PUT IN PLACE THOSE POLICIES IS ANOTHER MATTER AND DEPENDS ON OTHER AND RELATED FACTORS THAT WOULD REQUIRE SUBSEQUENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH TO BE ENUCLEATED.
835	AT THE ONSET OF THE MASS PROTESTS IN 2010-2011, MANY POLITICIANS AND EXPERTS SUGGESTED THAT ARAB COUNTRIES COULD LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION OF THE EARLY 1990S. HOWEVER, THE GEOPOLITICAL, HISTORICAL, AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT OF THE ARAB TRANSITION WAS DIFFERENT IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THAT OF THE FORMER SOVIET BLOC COUNTRIES 20 YEARS EARLIER. THESE DIFFERENCES BECAME EVEN MORE OBVIOUS FIVE YEARS LATER, IN EARLY 2016, WHEN MOST ARAB TRANSITION ATTEMPTS ENDED EITHER IN A NEW WAVE OF AUTHORITARIANISM, OR PROTRACTED BLOODY CONFLICTS. NONETHELESS, THERE ARE SOME COMMON LESSONS TO BE LEARNT FROM THE HISTORY OF BOTH TRANSITIONS. THEY CONCERN INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSITION, THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE SPEED OF REFORMS, THE DANGERS OF ETHNIC AND SECTARIAN CONFLICTS, AND THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL SUPPORT.
836	IN MARCH 2014, TAIWANESE STUDENTS OCCUPIED TAIWAN'S CONGRESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS OVER THE LEGISLATURE'S FAST-TRACK APPROVAL OF A SERVICE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA. RECENTLY, THERE WERE CALLS AND ACTIONS TO OCCUPY THE CENTRAL IN HONG KONG OVER THE CONTROVERSIAL RULES OF CHOOSING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE SPECIAL REGION. SOME HAVE HAILED MASS MOVEMENT OR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, INTER ALIA, AS THE TRIUMPH OF CIVIL SOCIETY, WHILE SOME LAMENTED IT AS THE DEATH OF MATURE DEMOCRACIES AND A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. THIS ESSAY ANALYSES THE SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT FROM THE PROSPECTS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, ARGUING THAT THE SUNFLOWER MOVEMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED A MODEL OF MARCHING TOWARDS CIVIC CONSTITUTIONALISM, IN THAT CIVIL GROUPS COMPETE WITH THEIR REPRESENTATIVE AGENTS AND THE COURTS IN SHAPING AND DEFINING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER.
837	IN THIS ARTICLE, ADAPTED FROM HIS OLIVER RUNDELL LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN LAW SCHOOL IN APRIL 1990, PROFESSOR CHARLES WILKINSON EXPLORES THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY CONFLICT ARISING OUT OF THE CHIPPEWA PEOPLE'S ASSERTION OF NINETEENTH CENTURY TREATY FISHING RIGHTS. A KEY TO COMPREHENDING THE CHIPPEWA'S POSITION IS A REALIZATION THAT THEY ARE GOVERNMENTS WHOSE SOVEREIGN RIGHTS PREDATE THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARE PRESERVED IN FEDERAL TREATIES AND STATUTES. THE CHIPPEWA'S SURVIVAL AS A PEOPLE DEPENDS UPON A RECOGNITION OF THEIR SOVEREIGN PREROGATIVES, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR HISTORY, A RESPECT FOR THEIR DIGNITY AND A JUST APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. TO THIS END, PROFESSOR WILKINSON ADVOCATES A STRATEGY OF COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD UPHOLD THE GOVERNMENT'S TREATY OBLIGATIONS AND ENSURE THE CONTINUED HEALTH OF THE STATE'S FISHERIES.
838	THE ARTICLE, ON THE ONE HAND, FOCUSES ON CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS IN BELARUS AFTER CIVIL UPHEAVAL IN 2020 AND THEN AFTER RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN WAR IN FEBRUARY 2022; ON THE OTHER HAND, IT EXAMINES THE SOCIO-POLITICAL STANCES OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN BELARUS ON SUCH ISSUES AS LIMITS OF LEGITIMATE VIOLENCE, PROTECTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND RIGHTS, FAIR ELECTIONS, RULE OF LAW, SOLIDARITY, JUSTICE. IT DOCUMENTS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND ANALYSES THE DIVIDE BETWEEN HIERARCHY AND GRASSROOTS CHRISTIANS - BOTH LAITY AND CLERGY - ON THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIETY, POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND POLITICAL COMMUNITY. FINALLY, IT POINTS OUT TO DEMOCRATIC AND ECUMENICAL POTENTIAL OF THE GRASSROOTS LOW SCALE PROTEST OF PRIESTS AND BELIEVERS, MOTIVATED BY THEIR CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE AND CONVICTIONS, WHICH MAY HAVE A POTENCY TO GO PUBLIC, WHEN THE NEXT WINDOW OF POSSIBILITIES WILL OPEN.
839	THE DEBATE ON EU RESPONSES TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN EU MEMBER STATES HAS MOSTLY BEEN ANCHORED ON TECHNOCRATIC APPEALS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND ON POLAND AND HUNGARY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ASK: WHAT UNDERSTANDINGS OF DEMOCRACY HAVE SHAPED THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S RESPONSE TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN RECENT YEARS? AFTER DEVELOPING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PLURALIST DEMOCRACY, WE UNCOVER THE WAY IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CONCEIVES OF DEMOCRACY THROUGH A DISCOURSE ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN COMMISSIONERS' SPEECHES (2018-21) AND A NORMATIVE-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. WE IDENTIFY THE COMMISSION'S CONCEPTION AS A FORM OF 'DEMOCRACY WITHOUT POLITICS', AND ARGUE THAT IT MATCHES THE EU'S POLICY CHOICES IN REGARD TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. WE ARGUE THAT A FULLER, HEALTHIER AND NORMATIVELY MORE ATTRACTIVE CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY ENCOMPASSES MORE ATTENTION TO POLITICAL PLURALISM, AGONISTIC CONTESTATION AND THE VIBRANCY OF CIVIL SOCIETY.
840	WITH THE DISTANCING OF THE EU FROM XI JINPING AND THE STRENGTHENING OF RELATIONS WITH JAPAN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC (FOIP) STRATEGY IN 2021, WE ARE WITNESSING THE BIRTH OF A NEW POLITICAL PARADIGM BINDING EUROPE TO ASIA BASED ON THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ONGOING WAR IN UKRAINE, THE RECENT US SHIFT WHICH SHOWS DISINTEREST IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, AND THE CREATION OF AUKUS ARE FACTORS THAT MIGHT ENHANCE THE FUTURE ROLE OF THE FOIP OR RISK TO WEAKEN IT. THIS CONTRIBUTION AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT AND ANALYZE THESE FACTORS, QUESTIONING THE FUTURE OF THIS STRATEGY AND SUGGESTING PATHS THAT CAN MAKE ITS IMPLEMENTATION MORE EFFECTIVE, IN ORDER TO EXPLOIT ALL THE POSSIBILITIES THAT MAY BE OFFERED THROUGH ITS AGENDA AND ENSURING THE MAINTENANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LIBERAL ORDER.
841	IN THE POST-MAASTRICHT ERA, MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE PROVED INCREASINGLY RELUCTANT TO TRANSFER FURTHER COMPETENCES TO THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL AND ARE WILLING TO SAFEGUARD THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. THOUGH THE RESPONSES TO THE CONTEMPORARY MULTIPLE CRISES ? RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICY, BORDERS AND MIGRATIONS, OR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ? HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT CONFLICTS OVER VALUES AND SOVEREIGNTY LOSSES SURROUNDING THE LEGAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY OF THE EU. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, WE ARGUE THAT BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL CONTENTIOUS (RE)DISTRIBUTION OF COMPETENCES BETWEEN NATION-STATES (NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY) AND THE EU (AND ITS EMBRYONIC FORMS OF SUPRANATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY), NEW CONFLICTS OF SOVEREIGNTY INVOLVE TWO OTHER KEY TYPES OF SOVEREIGNTY BELONGING TO THE DEMOCRATIC TRADITION, NAMELY PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY. THIS INTRODUCTORY ARTICLE PROPOSES A COMMON ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE CONFLICTS IN THEIR MULTI-DIMENSIONALITY.
842	TAILINGS DAM FAILURES REPRESENT ONE OF THE HIGHEST RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINING INDUSTRY. WHEN SUCH A DISASTER HAPPENS, IT USUALLY HAS ENORMOUS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. THE LITERATURE COMMONLY SUGGESTS THAT DAM FAILURE EVENTS HAPPEN AFTER PERIODS OF INCREASED MINERAL DEMAND. DURING HIGH DEMAND PEAKS, MORE WASTE MATERIAL IS GENERATED, AND DURING RECESSION, FINANCIAL CUTBACKS CAN LEAD TO UNPREDICTED EFFECTS ON SAFETY, ESPECIALLY IN OPERATIONS WHERE THE DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO MONITOR AND REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS FROM DATA COLLECTED DURING THE FIRST 60 DAYS AFTER THE FUNDAO DAM FAILURE IN BRAZIL, RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE CAPACITY OF COMPANIES AND AUTHORITIES TO DEAL WITH DISASTER REMEDIATION, WHICH HAVE ENABLED MULTILEVEL ACTIVISM. IT SHOWS HOW COLLECTIVE ACTIONS ARE RELEVANT TO SUPPORT LOCAL CLAIMS/CAMPAIGNS CONNECTED TO RIGHTS AND THE SERVICE OF JUSTICE IN THE DISASTER AFTERMATH.
843	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE BODIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE AS A SIGNIFICANT SUBJECT OF LEGAL RELATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF LIMITED ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY. THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AS UNIVERSAL IS TAKEN AS A BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION. IN MODERN STATES, THE BODIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE, EXERCISING THEIR SPECIAL POWERS, ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITING LEGAL REGULATION, LIKE ANY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITY. THE COMPLETENESS AND QUALITY OF FUNCTIONING OF VARIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE BODIES GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE STATE. IN ADDITION TO STATE-ORIENTED TASKS, THE BODIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE ARE AN IMPORTANT LINK IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM, ENSURING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS WORK, THE AUTHORS CHARACTERIZE THE SUBJECTS OF LIMITING LEGAL RELATIONS TAKING A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE SYSTEMS OF STATE POWER BODIES OF THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE MODERN WORLD.
844	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE LEGAL, ETHICAL AND MORAL COMPLICATIONS SHOWN IN ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON'S MASTERPIECE, TREASURE ISLAND, AND THE SHORT STORY THE PERSONS OF THE TALE. THE METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED CONSISTED ON QUALITATIVE OBSERVATION ON DIFFERENT PASSAGES OF THE BOOK. THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS A SHIFTING MORAL LANDSCAPE WHERE THE CHARACTERS OF THE PLOT MAKE ETHICAL CHOICE OUT OF THE MORAL AND SOCIAL CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY. THERE ARE NOT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE ISLAND. BUT WE ARE REMINDED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AT ALL TIMES. STEVENSON USES THIS PARTICULAR SCENARIO TO EXPRESS A SPECIAL AND SUGGESTIVE MORAL CODE WHERE AMBIGUITY, PARADOX AND CONTRADICTION ARE THE DOMINANT PATTERN. THERE ARE VERY FEW WORKS ABOUT STEVENSON FROM THE IUSPHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH, SO THE ARTICLE MAKES A CONTRIBUTION ON THE FIELD OF LAW AND LITERATURE.
845	THE NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE APPROACH ADVOCATES A MORE FLEXIBLE AND PARTICIPATORY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AS MEANS TO HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND INCREASED LEGITIMACY. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY AND THEREBY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' DISCRETION, HOWEVER, MAY POSE A RISK TO EQUALITY AND IMPARTIALITY, CORE VALUES IN DEMOCRATIC AND RULE-OF-LAW SOCIETIES. USING A SURVEY AMONG BALTIC PUBLIC EMPLOYEES, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THIS RISK. WE ASK WHETHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' PREFERENCES FOR FLEXIBLE RULE APPLICATION GO HAND IN HAND WITH ACCEPTANCE OF BENDING THE RULES, EVEN IF IT MEANS A BREACH OF IMPARTIALITY. WE FIND THAT THIS IS THE CASE. WE ALSO FIND THAT CONTRARY TO WHAT THE NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE APPROACH EXPECTS, NEITHER CITIZEN PARTICIPATION NOR GENERALIZED TRUST WORKS AS A CONTROL ON RULE BENDING. ON A POSITIVE NOTE, HOWEVER, WE FIND THAT CONTROL MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH WEBERIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION LESSEN ACCEPTANCE FOR BENDING THE RULES.
846	THE ANCIENT ISRAELITE TRADITION (TOR PRESENT PURPOSES, SPANNING THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY POST-EXODUS UP UNTIL THE EXILIC PERIOD) MANIFESTS ITSELF IN MANY OF THE PREVAILING THEORIES OF LAW AND JUSTICE UNDERLYING THE ARCHETYPAL WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE STRIVES TO PROCEED UNENCUMBERED BY CULTURAL-TEMPORAL BIAS TO EVALUATE THE RECURRING THEMES OF STRUCTURE, PROCEDURE, SUBSTANCE, INJUNCTION, SANCTION, AND OPERATION IN ANCIENT ISRAELITE LAW, THEREBY FRAMING THAT LEGAL TRADITION AS A COHESIVE WHOLE WHICH IS NOTABLE FOR THE PARALLELS THAT CAN BE DRAWN BETWEEN IT AND THE WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT WE NOW CONSIDER 'JUST'. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS NOTIONS OF DEMOCRACY, SOCIAL CONTRACT, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, EQUALITY, RULE OF LAW, RETROACTIVE LAW, DISSEMINATION OF LAW, CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, DEVELOPMENT OF LAW, NATURAL LAW THEORY, SOCIAL-WELTHRE LAW (INCLUDING THE JUBILEE LAWS), LEX TALIONIS, AND COMMUNAL RESPONSIBILITY AS A BASIS FOR PUNISHMENT.
847	PUBLIC OBJECTIVES ARE MOSTLY DEVELOPED WITHIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS, WHICH DESPITE APPARENT WEBERIAN RATIONALITY WORK MAINLY EVOLUTIONARILY, I.E. BY IMITATION OF WHAT ALREADY WORKS IN OTHER AREAS AND WHAT RANDOMLY BRINGS GOOD RESULTS. THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE WESTERN DEMOCRATIC ORDER CANNOT WORK WITHOUT MORALITY AND LEGAL VALUES. IF WE WANT WORKABLE VALUES, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THEM AT THEIR CORE, WHICH IS NOT THE DOMAIN OF LAW. THE STARTING POINT IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO OPERATES PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF HIS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS REGARDLESS OF ALL THE PRESENT THEORIES OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. ENTERING INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH FULL PREPAREDNESS FOR THE CHANGES WILL BE THE MOTTO OF THE FUTURE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE MUCH CLOSER TO SUCH A STANCE IF WE KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC SERVICE VALUES ARE REALLY ESTABLISHED AND IMPLEMENTED.
848	THIS PAPER REFERS TO RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS OFFICIALS, FROM OBEDIENCE IN GREECE, UNTIL IT ACQUIRES THE CONNOTATION PUBLIC SERVANT IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND IN TURN, THOSE OF THESE TO THEIR PARTNERS, AS WELL IS KNOWN THAT THOSE WHO HOLD THE STATE AND FULLY STAFFED FOR THE EXTERNALIZATION OF THAT, ARE THE ONES WHO PAY TAXES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE BUDGET OF EXPENDITURES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES TO REACH FRUITION. JUST AS THERE ARE OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE, THERE ARE DUTIES TO PERFORM BY THOSE WHO INHABIT IT, SO IT IS MANDATORY, UNDER PENALTY OF COMMITTING A CRIME, THE PAYMENT OF TAXES TO THE STATE, BUT FOR WHICH THE EXPENDITURES BY THE STATE TOWARDS ITS PEOPLE HAVE TELEOLOGY OR INTENDED PURPOSE, IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER ADMINISTRATION, IF THAT HAPPENS, YOU LOSE THE PHILOSOPHY OF GOOD MANNERS.
849	THE CLAIM THAT LAW IS GROUNDED IN REPRESENTATIONS OF AUTHORITY HARDLY REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES ONE VIEW OF THE POWER OF REPRESENTATIONS OF AUTHORITY TO SUBJECT SOCIETY TO THE LAW, AND ATTEMPTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ARCHITECTURE AS A MEDIUM OF SUCH REPRESENTATION. I WILL ARGUE THAT REPRESENTATION SETS APART THE REALMS OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD WHILE SUSTAINING A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO REALMS. IT HOUSES THE DEAD IN A SEPARATE REALM WHERE THEY EXERCISE AUTHORITY OVER THE LIVING. MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE FOUNDS THE AUTHORITY OF LAW, AND THE ENTIRE REALM INHABITED BY THE LIVING, BY RELEGATING THE DEAD TO A SEPARATE SPHERE WHERE THEY ASSUME THE POSITION OF ANCESTRAL LAWGIVERS. ARCHITECTURE CAN SEPARATE THE LIVING FROM THE DEAD AND ANCHOR THE RULE OF LAW BY VIRTUE OF ITS CLAIMS TO PERPETUITY AND AESTHETIC FORM.
850	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A NOVEL VIEW ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE GOVERNMENTAL APPARATUS THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE ACTIVITY OF POLITICIANS, MANAGERS, AND FUNCTIONARIES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE AUTHOR EMPLOYS THE NOTION OF "TYPE OF ACTIVITY" ELABORATED WITHIN THE MOSCOW METHODOLOGICAL CLUB THAT IS INTRODUCED IN CONTRAST TO SUCH FAMOUS NOTIONS AS "JOB POSITION" AND "PROFESSION". THE AUTHOR INTERPRETS FUNCTIONARY'S WORK AS A SPECIAL IDEAL TYPE OF ACTIVITY DESIGNED TO SECURE THE MAINTENANCE AND REPRODUCTION OF THE ORDER EMERGED THAT EMBODIES THE RULE OF LAW AND OPPOSES POLITICS AND MANAGEMENT AIMING AT CHANGES. M.RATZ DRAWS PICTURES OF THE DE FACTO EXISTING AND IDEAL BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEMS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE IDEAS ABOUT THE CLOSED AND OPEN TYPES OF THE SOCIETAL ORGANIZATION AND REVEALS PECULIARITIES OF POLITICS THAT RESULTS IN THE DOMINANCE OF EITHER OF THE TWO.
851	THE HIGH COURT'S ROLE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW HAS OFTEN BEEN EXAMINED FOR ITS IMPACT ON RIGHTS PROTECTION, AN AREA OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN AUSTRALIA DUE TO THE HISTORICAL LACK OF AN EXPLICIT BILL OF RIGHTS IN EITHER STATUTORY OR CONSTITUTIONAL FORM. IN 2004 RIGHTS ISSUES WERE PRESENTED IN PARTICULARLY STARK RELIEF IN SEVERAL KEY CASES, DEMONSTRATING THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE CASES ANALYSED HERE PRODUCE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF RELYING ON JUDICIAL REVIEW FOR RIGHTS PROTECTION WITHIN THE AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A CLEARER FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS THE JUDICIARY CAN UPHOLD UNAMBIGUOUS DECISIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE ENSHRINED IN STATUTE, EVEN WHERE AND WHEN THOSE PROVISIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO OVERRIDE THE RULE OF LAW, INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES.
852	THE SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE OCCURS ON THE BASIS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. FIRST, THIS HUMAN RIGHTS BASIS IS EXAMINED IN TERMS OF THEORIES OF CONFLICT AND COOPERATION. FURTHERMORE, IT IS INVESTIGATED WHETHER WISDOM SUFFICES AS A BASIS OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR WHETHER MORAL NORMS ARE NECESSARY. WITH THE DISTINGUISHING OF HUMAN RIGHTS INTO NEGATIVE, ACTIVE AND POSITIVE RIGHTS, DISTINCTIONS RESULT WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE, LEADING TO THE CONCEPTS OF A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND THE WELFARE STATE, AND EXPLAINING THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE THROUGH EXCHANGE, PARTICIPATION, DISTRIBUTION, AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS. OVERCOMING THE TENSION BETWEEN FORMAL RIGHTS OF FREEDOM AND SOCIAL RIGHTS, REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF SUBSIDIARITY AND DEMOCRACY. FINALLY, ISSUES ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THE THEORY OF JUSTICE ARE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE PROBLEM OF GLOBALISATION.
853	THE CONTRIBUTION EXPLAINS THE NECESSITY OF THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY AS A FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINE OF DEMOCRATIC THEORY. THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY MUST PRECEDE ALL THE THEORIES IN WHICH NORMS ARE DRAWN UP FOR THE FORM OF DEMOCRACIES; FOR ITS SUBJECT IS THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS SOCIAL PREREQUISITES. FOR IT, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES ARE LEGITIMATED IN RELATION TO OTHER RELIGIOUS AND IDEOLOGICAL VALUES. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE THE TWO MODEM OBJECTIONS TO A FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY ARE REFUTED, THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARY AND THAT THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. IN THE SECOND PART, AMONG OTHERS, MORAL, JURIDICAL, ANTHROPOLOGICAL AS WELL AS FUNCTIONAL CRITERIA FOR THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY ARE DEVELOPED. ON THIS BASIS, DEMOCRACY MUST BE SUPERIOR OR EQUAL TO ALL ALTERNATIVES.
854	ON THE BASIS OF A NATIONWIDE SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2020, THIS ARTICLE STRIVES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF CONTEMPORARY POLES. ABOVE ALL, IT AIMS TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE LAW IS OF VALUE IN POLISH SOCIETY-USED AS A TOOL FOR THE RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS, PROTECTION OF RIGHTS, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE ANALYSIS IS ANCHORED IN THE POLISH TRADITION OF RESEARCH ON LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, BUT GOES BEYOND THAT TRADITION TO EMPHASIZE A SENSE OF AGENCY AND COMPETENCY AS KEY COMPONENTS OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. MOREOVER, THE ANALYSIS LINKS LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO OTHER AREAS OF LIFE CONTROLLED BY LEGAL REGULATIONS. SUPPORTED BY SUCH THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN ORDER TO PONDER A QUESTION ABOUT THE EMPIRICAL ROOTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL ALIENATION IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF POLES TODAY.
855	THIS PAPER EXAMINES IMPACT OF HIRING REPUTABLE AUDITORS, UNDERWRITERS, AND LAWYERS, "NAMELY, THE THREE MUSKETEERS", BY ISSUING FIRMS ON THE GLOBAL IPO UNDERPRICING. WE EMPLOY LARGE AND UNIQUE DATASET OF 24,312 IPOS IN 22 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1995 AND 2019. WE FIND THAT ISSUERS BENEFIT FROM HIRING THE THREE MUSKETEERS TO CERTIFY ISSUERS' QUALITY TO REDUCE INVESTORS' EX-ANTE UNCERTAINTY TO GUARD THEIR OFFERINGS FROM UNDERPRICING. RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF THE IMPACT OF THE THREE MUSKETEERS ON UNDERPRICING IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT MARKET SOPHISTICATION, AUDITING AND REPORTING STANDARDS, AND RULE OF LAW. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT ISSUERS MAY WANT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN HIRING QUALITY AUDITORS, UNDERWRITERS, AND LAWYERS WHEN GOING PUBLIC SINCE NOT ALL THOSE REPUTABLE INTERMEDIARIES ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN ALLEVIATING UNDERPRICING. OUR RESEARCH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR IPO OWNERS, INVESTORS, RESEARCHERS, AND REGULATORS.
856	JUDGES ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, AND THEIR INDEPENDENCE IS PARAMOUNT TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN LIGHT OF THE POLITICIZATION OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS, IT IS WORTH ASKING IF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF 1787 CONTINUES TO SAFEGUARD JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE FRAMERS DESIGNED AN APPOINTMENT SYSTEM THAT SPLIT THE APPOINTMENT PROCEDURE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE TO MAINTAIN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER OF NOMINATION, AND THE SENATE HAS THE POWER TO CONFIRM NOMINEES. THIS NOTE FOCUSES ON THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO NOMINATE. SEISMIC CHANGES TO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND TO THE PRESIDENT'S CONSTITUTIONAL POWER, HAVE UNDERMINED JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND SUBJECTED THE JUDICIARY TO SALIENT PRESIDENTIAL BIAS. GIVEN BOTH POLITICAL AND LEGAL SHIFTS, THE NOMINATION PROCESS SHOULD BE VESTED IN THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, A DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE MORE DIRECTLY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE.
857	AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF EU MEMBER STATES IS THE HIGHEST IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, FORASMUCH AS AFTER JOINING THE EU THESE COUNTRIES HAVE ADAPTED THEIR NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE TO MUCH HIGHER STANDARDS THAN NATIONAL ONES. AS A RESULT, INVESTORS' CONFIDENCE IS GROWING, THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY ARE IMPROVING. IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE BASIC STRATEGIC FACTORS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN LESS DEVELOPED EU COUNTRIES WILL BE THE FACTORS RELATED TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF REGULATORY AND LEGAL SUPPORT OF THE SOCIAL-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW. THE FACTORS OUTLINED AND POLICIES TOWARDS ACHIEVING HIGH LEVEL CAN BE USED BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN REFORMING NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND PUBLIC GOVERNANCE.
858	THIS ARTICLE REVISITS THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE GOOD INTERNATIONAL CITIZEN (GIC) AS A CIVILISING AGENT IN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY. IT ARGUES THAT AN UNDERDEVELOPED RESOURCE FOR THINKING ABOUT STATE RESPONSIBILITIES AS GIC IS THE IDEA OF COSMOPOLITAN EXTRATERRITORIALITY (ET) IN RELATION TO HUMAN RIGHTS. ET, THE ASSERTION OF JURISDICTION BEYOND TERRITORIAL BORDERS, HAS LONG BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH STATIST AND NATIONALIST PURPOSES; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT COSMOPOLITAN, AND CIVILISING, POTENTIAL CAN BE FOUND WITHIN PRACTICES OF ET IN RELATION TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CRIMINAL LAW SUCH AS IN THE PRACTICES OF CHILD SEX TOURISM AND TRAFFICKING. THIS FORM OF ET ALLOWS STATES TO RESTRAIN THEIR OWN CITIZENS ABROAD AND POTENTIALLY RESTRAIN THEIR OWN FOREIGN POLICIES AND PRACTICES BY ACCEPTING LIMITS ON THEIR FREEDOM OF ACTION DERIVED FROM RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
859	IT SEEMED THAT COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WANTED TO MAKE IT SHORT AND SWEET: IT TOOK THE GRAND CHAMBER IN ITS ACHMEA JUDGMENT FEWER THAN 15 PAGES TO CONCLUDE THAT INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT IN AN INTRA-EU CONTEXT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EU LAW. THE JUDGMENT IS NOTEWORTHY IN TERMS OF BOTH THE CONCEPTUALISATION AS WELL AS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF AUTONOMY OF EU LAW. IN TERMS OF CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE PRINCIPLE, WHAT WE WITNESS IN ACHMEA, READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANOTHER DECISION, COULD BE A FIRST SUBTLE ATTEMPT TO ENRICH THE PRINCIPLE WITH NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN TERMS OF APPLICATION, THE COURT FURTHER STRENGTHENS LEGAL EQUALITY, ITS JUDICIAL MONOPOLY, AND-PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY-THE ROLE OF THE MEMBER STATES' COURTS, UNDERSTOOD AS "TRADITIONAL PERMANENT STATE COURTS", IN THE JUDICIAL DIALOGUE.
860	THE CORRUPTION ACTIVITIES OF THE KENYA POLICE ARE CONDUCTED PRIMARILY THROUGH SYNDICATES RUN BY SUPERIOR OFFICERS. POLICE CORRUPTION CRIME HAS EMERGED AS A SERIOUS "CRIME PROBLEM" IN KENYA, PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY GIVEN ITS REPUTATION AS BEING ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT NATIONS IN THE WORLD. IN COUNTRIES WHERE POLICE CORRUPTION IS PERSISTENT, SUCH AS KENYA, IT REPRESENTS A SYSTEMIC FAILURE OF GOVERNANCE WHERE THE PRINCIPAL INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY, THE OBSERVANCE OF ETHICS AND INTEGRITY STANDARDS, AND ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW ARE COMPROMISED AND THEMSELVES INFESTED WITH CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS AND SYNDICATES. THIS WORK DISCUSSES AND ANALYZES THE TRENDS AND MAGNITUDE OF POLICE CORRUPTION CRIME IN KENYA DRAWING ON AVAILABLE DATA AND PROVIDING DETAILED ANALYSIS TO SHOW A COHERENT PICTURE OF THE POLICE CORRUPTION PROBLEM AND ITS ENVIRONMENTAL/SITUATIONAL DETERMINANTS IN THE COUNTRY WITHIN THE CURRENT POLICING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.
861	THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ADOPTS A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO THE POLITICS OF REPRODUCTION IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY FRANCE AND BRITAIN. THE ARTICLES INVESTIGATE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION, PRACTICES AND TOOLS ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES AND BETWEEN GROUPS OF EXPERTS, ACTIVISTS AND LAYPEOPLE. EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED IN MEDICAL, NEWS MEDIA AND FEMINIST SOURCES, AS WELL AS ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK, THEY REVEAL THE PRACTICAL SIMILARITIES THAT EXISTED BETWEEN COUNTRIES WITH OFFICIALLY DIFFERENT POLITICAL REGIMES AS WELL AS LOCAL DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE TWO COUNTRIES. TAKEN AS A WHOLE, THE SPECIAL ISSUE SHOWS THAT THE BORDER BETWEEN FRANCE AND BRITAIN WAS MORE POROUS THAN IS TYPICALLY APPARENT FROM NATIONALLY-FOCUSED STUDIES: IDEAS, PEOPLE AND DEVICES TRAVELLED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS; COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES WERE ALWAYS ABLE TO EVADE THE RULE OF LAW; CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICES WERE SURPRISINGLY SIMILAR IN BOTH COUNTRIES; AND RELIGION LOOMED LARGE IN DEBATES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CHANNEL.
862	THE RELIANCE ON PRIVATE PARTIES IS A GLOBAL TENDENCY IN MODERN REGULATION. ONE PECULIAR REGULATORY TECHNIQUE WHICH FORESEES A CORE ROLE FOR PRIVATE PARTIES IS THAT OF EUROPEAN STANDARDIZATION. THE EMPLOYMENT OF STANDARDS FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES DELIVERS ENORMOUS BENEFITS FOR THE HARMONIZATION PROCESS AND IS TODAY A KEY FACTOR IN THE EU'S TRADE POLICY; HOWEVER, THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN STANDARDIZATION RAISES A NUMBER OF CONCERNS FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE, WHICH ARE LINKED TO `HYBRID NATURE' OF THE PROCESS, WHICH FORESEES AN INTERTWINED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THE AIM OF THIS CONTRIBUTION IS TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF PUBLIC LAW IN THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN STANDARDIZATION. AFTER DISCUSSING THE LEGAL NATURE OF EUROPEAN HARMONIZED STANDARDS, THE CURRENT APPLICATION AND POTENTIAL APPLICABILITY OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS DISCUSSED AND THE NECESSITY AND AVAILABILITY OF JUDICIAL CONTROL IS EXAMINED.
863	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL NORMATIVE PRODUCTION AND ITS LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY UNDER THE DOMINION OF SYMBOLIC POWER. BESIDES BEING THE ENVIRONMENT A COMMON GOOD THE ONES WHO HAVE THE COMPETENCE TO RULE ABOUT IT ARE VERY FEW PUBLIC OFFICES. THE RESULT IS A CONSTRAINED RULE OF LAW UNABLE TO ENCOMPASS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND A LACK OF INDICATORS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW: ITS EXISTENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION IN QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE VALUES. THE ARGUMENT OF THIS PAPER IS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SHOULD BE MEASURED, PRODUCED AND APPLIED IN THE LIGHT OF THE GOVERNANCE PARADIGM EMPOWERING MULTISTAKEHOLDERS THROUGHMULTIPLE CHANNELS OF INFLUENCE CAUSING SYNERGISTIC, OVERLAPPING, OR EVEN CONTRADICTORY ACTIONS, BUT EFFICIENTLY INFLUENCING ACTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE CAUSES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. THE PRESENT ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES USING THE HYPOTHETICAL DEDUCTIVE METHOD.
864	IN A PARTICULAR VIEW, JOHN RAWLS' THEORY HAS TWO COMPONENTS. FIRST IS "POLITICAL LIBERALISM" WHICH APPLIES TO WESTERN SOCIETIES THAT OVER THE PAST CENTURIES HAVE ESTABLISHED A DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURE AND ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THIS THEORY IS NOT A "COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPTION" AND NOT FOR EVERY SOCIETY, BUT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM IN THE SECOND COMPONENT OF RAWLS' THEORY. THIS IS PRESENTED IN THE LAW OF PEOPLES. IN THIS BOOK RAWLS ELABORATES HIS THEORY REGARDING SOCIETIES WHICH LACK A DEMOCRATIC HERITAGE, YET ARE REGARDED AS "DECENT SOCIETIES" AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME LIBERAL SOCIETIES. IN HIS VIEW, BY ACCEPTING A NON-LIBERAL SOCIETIES INTO THE SOCIETY OF PEOPLE, THE NON-LIBERAL SOCIETY WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO BECOME LIBERAL. IN THIS ARTICLE WE CONSIDER THE THEORY PROPOSED IN THE LAW OF PEOPLES WITH REFERENCE TO IRANIAN SOCIETY.
865	THIS ARTICLE RECONSTRUCTS THE MAIN ARGUMENTS IN JOHN LOCKE'S FIRST POLITICAL WRITINGS, THE HIGHLY RHETORICAL, AND OFTEN OBSCURE, TWO TRACTS ON GOVERNMENT (1660-1662). THE TRACTS SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO IMPOSE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES ON ITS PEOPLE, AN ASTONISHING FACT GIVEN LOCKE'S FAMOUS DEFENSE OF TOLERATION IN HIS LATER WORKS. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE TRACTS DEVELOPED HERE ALLOWS US TO SEE THAT RATHER THAN A PESSIMISTIC VIEW OF THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE UNDER RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY, WHAT MAINLY ANIMATES THE YOUNG LOCKE IS A DESIRE TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST AN ANARCHICAL CONCEPTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THE ARTICLE ALSO ARGUES THAT THE EVOLUTION OF LOCKE'S THINKING ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WAS IN LARGE PART GOVERNED BY LOCKE'S ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN A WAY THAT AVOIDS ITS HAVING ANARCHICAL IMPLICATIONS.
866	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW ROUSSEAU'S FIRST DISCOURSE AND THE QUESTIONS IT POSED ABOUT HUMAN PROGRESS AND THE REFORM OF SOCIETY WERE DEBATED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF THE BERLIN ACADEMY BY FORME), AND HERDER. DESPITE SOME IMPORTANT DISAGREEMENTS, FORTNEY AND HERDER FUNDAMENTALLY SHARED ROUSSEAU'S ASSUMPTION THAT ERUDITION COULD BE DETRIMENTAL BOTH TO SOCIETY AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL. IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE SOCIALLY CORROSIVE EFFECTS OF THE ARTS AND THE SCIENCES, AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO REALIZE THEIR FULL BENEFICENT POTENTIAL, THEY CALLED FOR THEIR REFORM THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL REGULATION AND MANAGEMENT BY A MERITOCRACY OF SCHOLARLY EXPERTS. DRAWING ON HUME, HERDER IN PARTICULAR DEVELOPED A POSITIVE ROLE FOR THE MODERN STATE AS AN ACTIVE AGENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT, PROVIDED IT NOT ONLY PROMOTED THE ARTS AND SCIENCES BUT ALSO GUARANTEED FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW TO ENSURE THEIR FLOURISHING.
867	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO PROVING A HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SPECIFICITY OF THE MODERN RUSSIAN STATE IS BEST REFLECTED IN THE METAPHOR OF PALACE EMPLOYED BY V.O.KLYUCHEVSKY FOR CHARACTERIZING THE RUSSIAN STATE THAT WAS FORMED AFTER PETER I'S DEATH. ACCORDING TO I.GLEBOVA, A "PALACE" REPRESENTS A RATHER INDEPENDENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT EMERGED AS A RESPONSE TO NEW CONDITIONS AND OLD STATE TRADITIONS RATHER THAN DEVIATION FROM THE "RIGHT" STATE (THE SOVIET "NATIONWIDE" OR WESTERN RULE OF LAW) OR ITS PERVERSION/"WORSENING" THAT CAN BE IMPROVED IF SOMEONE IS WILLING TO DO SO. THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THIS ISSUE DESCRIBES KEY PARAMETERS OF THE POST-SOVIET STATE THAT MAKES IT RESEMBLE A "PALACE" AND ANALYZES REASONS THAT LEAD TO THE RESTORATION OF A SIMILAR TYPE OF STATE IN RUSSIA.
868	EVERYDAY ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ARE RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED IN RESEARCH ON ILLIBERALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS GAP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEOLIBERALIST AND TECHNOPOPULISTIC MOTIVATIONS THAT SUPPORT ILLIBERAL AND AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES IN A WEAK RULE OF LAW CONTEXT. USING NARRATIVE ANALYSIS, IT INTERPRETS THE ROLE OF BELIEFS AND DESIRES OF POLITICO-ADMINISTRATIVE ACTORS IN FACILITATING SUCH ACTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF INDIA'S PUBLIC SECTOR DIGITALISATION. THIS ARTICLE ELABORATES HOW THE INSTRUMENTAL RATIONALITIES EMBEDDED INTO THE DESIGN OF DIGITALISED POLICIES AND THEIR PRACTICES AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF ANALYSIS CAN ERODE VOLUNTARINESS AND PRIVACY AS WELL AS UNDERCUT DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS ARTICLE MAKES A CASE FOR RECENTERING THE DEMOCRATIC ETHOS IN DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING DIGITALISED POLICY REGIMES TO ENSURE EVERYDAY ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ARE ALIGNED WITH THE NEED TO AVOID THE INFRINGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
869	EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW IS A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMON LAW AND IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, GIVEN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THE RULE OF LAW. ANALYSIS AS TO THE PRECISE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PRINCIPLE CAN HELP US BETTER TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT OBLIGATIONS TO ACT CONSISTENTLY PLAY WITHIN JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE WHETHER CONSISTENCY OUGHT TO BE CLASSED AS A SEPARATE GROUND OF REVIEW AND ARGUE THAT THIS IS UNNECESSARY. EXAMINATION OF THE ROLE THAT LEGAL EQUALITY PLAYS WITHIN COMMON LAW REASON GENERALLY WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE ROLE THAT IT PLAYS WITHIN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN PARTICULAR. CONSISTENCY IS BEST CONCEIVED AS A BACKGROUND PRINCIPLE, INFORMED BY THE VALUE OF LEGAL EQUALITY, HOUSED WITHIN REASONABLENESS REVIEW AND NOT AS A SEPARATE GROUND OF REVIEW THAT COULD ELIDE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN REVIEW AND APPEAL.
870	THE GVC INVOLVEMENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN CHANNELS TO IMPROVE FOREIGN CAPITAL. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES WHETHER AND HOW PARTICIPATION AND POSITION IN THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) OF HOST COUNTRIES IS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS BASED ON FIXED-EFFECT REGRESSION. BY USING A COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA SET MEASURES THE GVC INVOLVEMENT OF 21 ASIAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THIS RESEARCH FINDS THAT MORE INTENSE GVC PARTICIPATION AND UPSTREAM SPECIALIZATION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER SHARE OF FDI INFLOWS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR COUNTRIES TO EXPAND GVC PARTICIPATION AND IMPROVE GVC POSITION IN ORDER TO ATTRACT MORE FOREIGN CAPITAL. BESIDES, THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF A COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AS MEDIATING FACTORS IN THE EXTENT OF FDI INFLOWS. THESE EFFECTS ARE LARGER IN COUNTRIES WITH BETTER CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND STRONGER RULE OF LAW.
871	IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE CORONA VIRUS, THE POLISH GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC LIFE AND THE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS ON THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF POLISH CITIZENS. THE PANDEMIC SITUATION WAS ANNOUNCED BY DECREE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PIS IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE WITH PLANS TO HOLD THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS ON 10 MAY 2020. IN ORDER TO DO SO, IT HAS INTRODUCED CHANGES TO THE ELECTORAL LAW, MAKING POSTAL VOTING OBLIGATORY. THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT TO HOLD PUBLIC GATHERINGS ARE PREVENTING AN EQUAL AND FAIR PUBLIC ELECTION CAMPAIGN. THIS APPROACH IS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THERE IS A DANGER THAT WHILE ATTENTION IS FOCUSSED ON FIGHTING THE CORONA VIRUS, TOO LITTLE NOTICE WILL BE TAKEN AMONG THE EUROPEAN GENERAL PUBLIC OF CHALLENGES TO THE RULE OF LAW.
872	THE NUMBER OF DISCOVERED WRONGFUL CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (AND RESULTING EXONERATIONS) HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST DECADE. THESE CASES ERODE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TRUST IN THE RULE OF LAW. MANY STATES HAVE ADOPTED LAWS THAT AIM TO REDUCE SYSTEM ERRORS BUT NO STUDY HAS EXAMINED WHY SOME STATES APPEAR MORE WILLING TO PROVIDE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS AGAINST WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS THAN OTHERS. FINDINGS FROM REGRESSION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT STATES WITH A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE OR MORE REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO PASS THESE LAWS WHILE THE PRESENCE OF ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PART OF THE 'INNOCENCE MOVEMENT' MAKE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE MORE LIKELY. WE THUS IDENTIFY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT BETWEEN U.S. STATES THAT INFLUENCE THE ADOPTION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
873	RECOGNIZING A GAP IN THE AFRICAN POLICING LITERATURE CREATED DUE TO THE LACK OF RESEARCH ON POLICE OFFICERS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE PUBLIC, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY EXAMINING OFFICERS PERCEPTIONS OF THE PUBLIC AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH PERCEPTIONS INFLUENCE OFFICERS BEHAVIOR ON THE STREET AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF EFFECTIVENESS. USING A RANDOMIZED SAMPLE OF 145 POLICE OFFICERS SELECTED FROM FIVE POLICE DISTRICTS IN ACCRA, GHANA, THE STUDY FOUND THAT POLICE OFFICERS IN GHANA GENERALLY HOLD NEGATIVE VIEWS OF THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE. FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED THAT OFFICERS PERCEPTION OF PUBLIC COOPERATION SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICT THEIR BEHAVIOR AND PERCEPTION OF EFFECTIVENESS IN CONTROLLING CRIME IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, OFFICERS PERCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC RECOGNITION AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW WERE NOT FOUND TO PREDICT THEIR BEHAVIOR AND PERCEPTION OF EFFECTIVENESS. POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED.
874	IN 1884 AN OTTOMAN PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND FELLOW OFFICIALS STOOD TRIAL FOR ABUSING THEIR OFFICIAL AUTHORITIES WHEN ATTENDING TO AN INCIDENT IN ONE OF ISTANBUL'S NEIGHBORHOODS. A PUBLISHED VERBATIM REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS IS USED IN THIS ARTICLE FOR DISCUSSING OTTOMAN SOCIO-LEGAL CHANGE IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, EMPLOYING A MICROHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. FOLLOWING A MAJOR REFORM IN THE NEW COURT SYSTEM, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 1860S (THE NIZAMIYE COURTS), THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES USED THE TRIAL IN QUESTION FOR TRANSMITTING THE COMMITMENT OF THE MODERNIZING STATE TO THE RULE OF LAW, EXHIBITED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF OFFICIALS' ACCOUNTABILITY. FEATURES OF THE REFORMED JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND ITS DISTINCTIVE LEGAL CULTURE ARE DEMONSTRATED IN THIS ARTICLE BY UNFOLDING THE JUDICIAL ASPECTS OF THIS EPISODE AND BY DISCUSSING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM AND THE IMMEDIATE SOCIOPOLITICAL AND SOCIO-LEGAL CONTEXTS OF THE TRIAL.
875	THIS PAPER ASSUMES THAT LAWYER INDEPENDENCE IS A COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT, AS SUCH, IT DESERVES AS MUCH PROTECTION AS DOES INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES. THE AUTHOR POSITS THAT LAWYER INDEPENDENCE CAN ONLY BE PROTECTED IF LAWYERS GOVERN LAWYERS. ENGLAND AND QUEENSLAND ARE CITED AS EXAMPLES OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE UNDERMINED LAWYER INDEPENDENCE BY ADOPTING LAWYER REGULATORY MEASURES AIMED AT CONSUMER PROTECTION. CANADA IS CITED AS A JURISDICTION THAT SEEKS TO PRESERVE LAWYER INDEPENDENCE BY RECOGNISING THAT LAWYERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO ACT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST CAN SATISFACTORILY REGULATE OTHER LAWYERS. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT LAWYER INDEPENDENCE IS A PUBLIC TRUST, THAT ALL LAWYERS ARE THE TRUSTEES AND THAT THEY MUST RESIST THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY ARRANGEMENTS THAT COMPROMISE LAWYER INDEPENDENCE. HE PROPOSES A METHOD FOR DEALING WITH CORRUPT OR COMPLACENT LAWYER REGULATORS.
876	THE CASE COMMISSION V. HUNGARY (C-78/18) CONCERNS INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST THE 2017 ACT ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF ORGANISATIONS RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM ABROAD, ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT BREACHED THE FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AS WELL AS THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION, AND THE RIGHTS TO FAMILY AND PRIVATE LIFE AND TO PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA. THE LAW REQUIRED NGOS TO PUBLISH THE DETAILS OF FOREIGN-BASED DONORS AND THE AMOUNT OF THEIR DONATIONS, ABOVE A SPECIFIED THRESHOLD. SUCH NGOS WERE FURTHER STIGMATISED BY HAVING TO DESIGNATE THEMSELVES AS "ORGANISATIONS RECEIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ABROAD" ON THEIR WEBSITE AND LITERATURE. THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE E-PORTAL OF THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT. THIS COMMENTARY ANALYSES CASE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ONGOING RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES FACED BY NGOS AND OTHERS IN HUNGARY.
877	DRAWING ON EXPERIMENTAL GAMES AND A SURVEY CONDUCTED WITH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AT AN ELITE LEGAL ACADEMY IN UKRAINE, THIS STUDY COMPARES THE BEHAVIORAL, ATTITUDINAL, AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRAITS OF STUDENTS ASPIRING TO PUBLIC SECTOR LEGAL CAREERS AS JUDGES, PROSECUTORS, AND INVESTIGATORS WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS AIMING TO PURSUE PRIVATE SECTOR LEGAL CAREERS AS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND COMMERCIAL LAWYERS. I FIND EVIDENCE THAT STUDENTS PURSUING PUBLIC SECTOR LEGAL CAREERS DISPLAY MORE WILLINGNESS TO CHEAT OR BRIBE IN EXPERIMENTAL GAMES AS WELL AS LOWER LEVELS OF ALTRUISM. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CORRUPTION IN SOME SOCIETIES MAY PERSIST IN PART FROM THE SELF-SELECTION INTO GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS OF CITIZENS WITH A HIGHER PROPENSITY TO SEEK PROFIT FROM ILLICIT ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SUCH CORRUPT SELF-SELECTION CAN INFECT A COUNTRY'S JUDICIAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT APPARATUS, WITH POTENTIALLY DIRE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
878	COULD AGGRESSIVE SOCCER PLAY REFLECT GENERALIZED AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN SOCIETY? IN PARTICULAR, COULD AGGRESSIVE SOCCER PLAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW LEVELS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL? I EXAMINE THESE QUESTIONS USING THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF RED AND YELLOW CARDS PER GAME DURING THE 2019/2020 SEASON AS AN INDICATOR OF AGGRESSIVE SOCCER PLAY IN 86 DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL LEAGUES. I CAPTURE SOCIAL CAPITAL USING SIX DIFFERENT INDICATORS MEASURING RULE OF LAW AND GENERALIZED TRUST. MY REGRESSIONS CONTROL FOR SEVERAL FACTORS POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESSIVE SOCCER PLAY INCLUDING A MEASURE OF THE QUALITY OF THE LEAGUE. I FIND THAT SOCIAL CAPITAL IS ROBUST AND INVERSELY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF CARDS BOOKED PER GAME. THAT IS, THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT PLAYERS NAVIGATE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FIELD, I.E. PLAYERS PLAY THE WAY THEY LIVE.
879	CONFIDENTIALITY HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENFORCEMENT MODEL FOR EQUALITY LAW IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CONTRARY TO THE FOCUS ON OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE COURTS GENERALLY, CONFIDENTIALITY IS EMBEDDED IN THE ENFORCEMENT, PROCESS, AND OUTCOMES OF EQUALITY LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CONSIDER THE ROLE AND UTILITY OF CONFIDENTIALITY IN EQUALITY LAW IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UK. WE SCRUTINISE THE WAYS CONFIDENTIALITY IS EMBEDDED IN THE ENFORCEMENT, PROCESS, AND OUTCOMES OF EQUALITY LAW IN EACH JURISDICTION, INCLUDING VIA AN EXAMINATION OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS, THE PROCESSES ADOPTED BY STATUTORY EQUALITY AGENCIES, AND THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT CLAIMS. WE ARGUE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF EQUALITY LAW REQUIRES A MORE NUANCED BALANCE BETWEEN CONFIDENTIALITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL AND SYSTEMIC AIMS OF EQUALITY LAW AND THE IMPERATIVES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
880	THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION OF 1988 SHOULD NOT BE REPRESENTED AS A DOCUMENT SIMPLY ALLOWING BRAZIL'S POLITICAL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THEORIES AND ITS CRITICS, FROM CARL SCHMITT TO GIORGIO AGAMBEN, PUT INTO LIGHT THE UNAPPARENT NEXUS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE STATE OF EXCEPTION. THE CONSTITUTION FOLLOWING A POST-AUTHORITARIAN SCENARIO IS A HALF-WAY STAGE BETWEEN THE NEW DEMOCRATIC AND THE PREVIOUS REGIMES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS SOME OF THOSE PERMANENCE-RUPTURE PHENOMENA REVIEWING THE BRAZILIAN LITERATURE ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND APPROACHES THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION OF 1988 THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF ARCHIVE. THE NEW APPROACH IS PROPOSED EXPLORING THE IDEA OF ARCHIVE IN MICHEL FOUCAULT'S AND JACQUES DERRIDA'S PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS, ENHANCING THE LINK BETWEEN A POLITICS OF ARCHIVING AND THE PRACTICE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL HETEROTOPY AS A POTENTIAL POLITICAL EXIT.
881	THIS CONTRIBUTION INTRODUCES THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF INFORMATION THAT 'INFORMS' COMPUTER SYSTEMS, THE INTERNET AND ALL THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UPON IT. THE AIM OF THE AUTHOR IS TO INVITE LAWYERS TO RECONSIDER THE GRAMMAR AND ALPHABET OF MODERN POSITIVE LAW AND OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN THE FACE OF THE ALTERNATIVE GRAMMAR AND ALPHABET OF A DATA-DRIVEN SOCIETY. INSTEAD OF EITHER EMBRACING OR REJECTING THE TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSITIONS THAT RECONFIGURE THE OPERATIONS OF THE LAW, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LAWYERS SHOULD COLLABORATE WITH THE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS THAT ENGINEER AND DESIGN THE AFFORDANCES OF OUR NEW ONLIFE WORLD. THIS IS CRUCIAL IF WE WANT TO SUSTAIN DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION IN LAW-MAKING, CONTESTABILITY OF LEGAL EFFECT AND TRANSPARENCY OF HOW CITIZENS MAY BE MANIPULATED BY THE INVISIBLE COMPUTATIONAL BACKBONE OF OUR RAPIDLY AND RADICALLY CHANGING WORLD.
882	WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF INVESTMENT ON GROWTH IN A SAMPLE OF 85 DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER 1984-2009, CONDITIONING THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF INVESTMENT ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE PANEL STRUCTURE OF OUR DATASET ALLOWS CONTROLLING FOR UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY AND DEALING WITH THE RISK OF ENDOGENEITY BIAS. WE FIND THAT INVESTMENT INCREASES GROWTH MORE IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAN IN COUNTRIES WITH DEFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO ESTIMATING THE MODEL SEPARATELY FOR DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, FOR EACH CONTINENT, AND OVER TWO SUB-PERIODS. A JACKKNIFE EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THEY DO NOT DEPEND ON ANY SINGLE COUNTRY. THE RESULTS ARE ESSENTIALLY DRIVEN BY THE QUARTILES OF COUNTRIES WITH THE LOWEST AND THE HIGHEST INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND BY THE GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY, CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW SUB-COMPONENTS OF THE ICRG INDEX.
883	BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED FROM A MODEL RURAL TRIBUNAL IN EASTERN CHINA, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW RURAL COURTS ACHIEVE POPULARITY AMONG LITIGANTS BY EMPLOYING PATERNALISTIC APPROACHES AND HOW THE APPROACHES INFLUENCE RURAL PEOPLE'S LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. BY CHANNELLING THE DISPUTES, OBTAINING THE TRUST OF THE LITIGANTS AND MARGINALISING LEGAL RULES, JUDGES DIVERT THE TRIAL TO THE PREDETERMINED RECONCILIATORY OUTCOMES AND SET THE LITIGANTS' OWN DEMANDS ASIDE. THE LITIGANTS, WHO WERE IN AWE OF THE LAWS, ARE NOW ENCHANTED BY THE APPROACH AND START TO DEVELOP AN ILLUSORY PERCEPTION OF PLAYING WITH THE LAWS. THE LITIGANTS' LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, HOWEVER, IS NOT IMPROVED BY THEIR LITIGATION EXPERIENCE, AS RESOLUTION IS ACHIEVED NOT ACCORDING TO THE SUBSTANTIVE LEGAL RULES, BUT OUT OF THE JUDGES' PREFERENCES. THE RESEARCH FURTHER SHEDS LIGHT ON THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RURAL AREAS.
884	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE EXTENT, IMPACTS, AND GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS OF ILLEGAL LOGGING AND ASSOCIATED CORRUPTION IN THE CHAINSAW MILLING SECTOR IN CAMEROON AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES, REPRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FOREST LAW ENFORCEMENT, GOVERNANCE AND TRADE (FLEGT) ACTION PLAN. WE SHOW THAT STATE OFFICIALS MAY BE COLLECTING SOME EURO6 MILLION IN INFORMAL PAYMENTS EACH YEAR, PART OF WHICH IS SIPHONED INTO A PYRAMIDAL SYSTEM THAT MANAGES CAREERS NOT BY MERIT, BUT BY THE PRICE ONE CAN PAY. WE ARGUE THAT CORRUPTION BECOMES A ROOT CAUSE OF POLICY FAILURES WHEN DISILLUSIONED STATE OFFICIALS PERCEIVE THAT THOSE AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID DO NOT HAVE THE LEGITIMACY NEEDED TO PROMOTE REFORMS. ARBITRARINESS, MISTRUST, AND CONTRADICTION THEN PREDOMINATE, THUS WEAKENING THE RULE OF LAW. WE DERIVE LESSONS FOR INTERVENTIONS ADDRESSING CORRUPTION AND ITS IMPACTS.
885	AS PART OF THE 'WAR ON TERROR ' DECLARED IN RESPONSE TO THE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 ATTACKS, COUNTRIES INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO BOLSTER NATIONAL SECURITY, OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND LONG-ESTABLISHED LEGAL PRINCIPLES. LIKE THE COLDWAR, THE 'WAR ON TERROR ' IS CAST AS A GLOBAL STRUGGLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL. NEW ZEALAND DEFIED COLD WAR LOGIC WITH ITS ANTI-NUCLEAR POLICY. EXAMINING THE DIFFICULTIES OF UPHOLDING PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND THE RULE OF LAW WHILE BOLSTERING NATIONAL SECURITY, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES NEW ZEALAND'S ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION AND SHOWS THAT IT HAS STEADILY MOVED AWAY FROM ITS INITIAL MEASURED APPROACH. IT ARGUES THAT NEW ZEALAND COULD AND SHOULD DEVELOP AN ANTI-TERRORISM MODEL APPROPRIATE TO LOW-RISK SOCIETIES, AND THAT, LIKE ITS ANTI-NUCLEAR STANCE DURING THE COLD WAR, SUCH AN INDEPENDENT APPROACH WOULD BE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD COMMUNITY.
886	MATE SZABO - RECENTLY THE OMBUDSMAN OF CITIZENS' RIGHT IN HUNGARY - WRITES ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN POSITION AND RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP AND LINK IS BETWEEN THE OMBUDSMAN AND THE CITIZENS WHO BREAK THE LAW FOCUSING ON THE PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. MW SZABO THINKS THAT BOTH OF THE TWO ROLES ARE IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE "CULTURE OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS" (REACTIVE ROLE) AND ALSO TO IMPROVE THEM (PROACTIVE ROLE). BOTH OF THE OMBUDSMAN POSITION AND THE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ARE IN AN INTERMEDIARY SPHERE BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY, BUT THE OMBUDSMAN IS NEARER TO THE "UPPER" POLE, THE AREAS OF CONSTITUTION, RULE OF LAW AND PRACTICE OF LAW. THE STUDY THEN ANALYZES THE POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS OF THE HUNGARIAN OMBUDSMAN SYSTEM AND FINALLY INTRODUCES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS BY SUGGESTING CREATING A SPECIAL OMBUDSMAN POSITION.
887	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CREATION, ADAPTATION, AND USE OF THE LEGAL PROVISIONS EMPLOYED TO CONTROL PROTESTERS DURING THE G20 IN TORONTO (2010), INCLUDING THE USE OF A SPECIAL REGIME BASED ON THE PUBLIC WORKS PROTECTION ACT (PWPA). THE USE OF AN OBSCURE WORLD WAR II LAW AND THE LACK OF GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO PROTESTERS CREATED CONDITIONS FOR THE MOST INTENSE MASS ARREST IN CANADIAN HISTORY (1118 PEOPLE IN TWO DAYS). WE SUGGEST THAT WE ARE WITNESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FORMS OF PUNITIVE GOVERNANCE THAT OPERATE BEYOND THE CRIMINAL LAW, ON THE EDGE OF THE RULE OF LAW ( "LEGAL GAPS ") AND THE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH CRIMINAL TRIALS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE USE OF THESE PUNITIVE SHORTCUTS IS LEGALLY DANGEROUS AND HAS THE SYSTEMIC EFFECT OF CONCENTRATING A GREAT DEAL OF POWER IN POLICE INSTITUTIONS.
888	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE BENEFITS AND PITFALLS OF INTERNATIONAL POLICING IN HAITI OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY. IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE POLITICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR JOINT POLICING ARRANGEMENTS. HAITI'S EXPERIENCE ILLUSTRATES THAT INTERNATIONAL PERSONNEL CAN PROVIDE USEFUL STOPGAP POLICING SERVICES WHEN THE INTERESTS OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS CONVERGE AROUND PUBLIC ORDER CRISES. HOWEVER, THE HAITIAN CASE ALSO SHOWS HOW WEAK POLITICAL COMMITMENT ON ONE OR BOTH SIDES CAN LEAD TO VAGUE MANDATES, POOR COOPERATION IN THE FIELD, WEAK POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY, AND STALLED DOMESTIC REFORMS. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE UNDERMINED THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PERSONNEL AND THE HAITIAN NATIONAL POLICE, ERODING PUBLIC TRUST IN BOTH. ULTIMATELY, INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION HAS FAILED TO YIELD A CAPABLE, TRUSTED, AND APOLITICAL HAITIAN POLICE FORCE OR A NOTABLY STRONGER RULE OF LAW. HAITI THUS OFFERS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR INTERNATIONAL POLICING.
889	WHY HAVE PEACE-BUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS SO FREQUENTLY FAILED TO CREATE DURABLE INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN DETER OR WITHSTAND RESURGENT VIOLENCE IN VOLATILE SITES OF CYCLICAL CONFLICT? EXTANT THEORY PREDICTS THAT NEW INSTITUTIONS CAN HELP OVERCOME VIOLENCE AND MITIGATE COMMITMENT PROBLEMS IN POSTCONFLICT CONTEXTS BY REDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS. BY CONTRAST, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT POSTCONFLICT INSTITUTIONS OFTEN PROVE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO DURABLE PEACE BECAUSE THEY OFFER WARTIME ELITES NEW VENUES IN WHICH TO PURSUE CONFLICT-ERA AGENDAS. THROUGH A MICRO-ANALYSIS OF EFFORTS TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW IN EASTERN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, I DEMONSTRATE THAT WARTIME ELITES CAPTURE AND INSTRUMENTALIZE NEW LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR INTRA-AND INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL SURVIVAL; TO PURSUE ECONOMIC, MILITARY, AND POLITICAL AGENDAS BEHIND THE SCENES; AND, IN SOME CASES, TO PREPARE FOR AN IMMINENT RETURN TO WAR.
890	THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (ESM) STANDS PARS PRO TOTO FOR HOW THE EU AND THE MEMBER STATES HAVE CONFRONTED WHAT ALLEGEDLY STARTED OUT AS A SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS AND HAS TURNED INTO AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OF THE EU ATTEMPTS TO GET EUROPE BACK ON TRACK RELY TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND ABANDON SOME OF THE EU'S CORE VALUES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE, MORE LEGITIMATE ROUTE. IT ARGUES THAT ESM-LIKE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EU'S LEGAL ORDER, BY USING THE LEGAL INSTRUMENT OF ENHANCED COOPERATION UNDER ARTICLE 20 TEU A CRITICAL ANALYSIS IS GIVEN OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE UNDER THE ESM, ADDRESSING AND ASSESSING ITS SHORTCOMINGS IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL AND LACK OF INPUT LEGITIMACY. THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ENHANCED COOPERATION FOR THE ESM IS EXAMINED.
891	THIS PAPER EXAMINES DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA BETWEEN 1960 AND 1999. IT DISCUSSES VARIOUS DEMOCRACIES AND SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS INHERENT IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATIONS. THIS WORK ADOPTS A QUALITATIVE APPROACH USING BOTH CONTENT AND HISTORICAL ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE SECONDARY SOURCES GATHERED ON BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY REGIMES AS THEY AFFECTED DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCES IN NIGERIA. THIS PAPER AIMS AT HELPING POLICY MAKERS IN CARRYING OUT POLICIES THAT WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE ELECTORAL BODIES/CONDUCTS, RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW/CONSTITUTION, ENSURE GOOD GOVERNANCE WHICH WILL IMPROVE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES AND CEMENT DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN THE NATION HENCE EVIDENCE FROM FINDINGS INDICATE THAT DEMOCRACY HAVE FAILED TO TRIUMPH IN NIGERIA DUE TO REASONS EMANATING FROM BAD GOVERNANCE AND LACK OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THE PAPER PROVIDES SOME PLAUSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL BE OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO POLICY MAKERS AND TO GENERAL INTEREST OF NIGERIA IF PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED.
892	THE STUDY INVESTIGATED THE VIEWS AND PERCEPTION OF SCHOOL LEAVERS ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN NIGERIA. A SELF-DESIGNED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED FOR COLLECTION OF THEIR VIEWS. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE STUDY COMPRISED 500 SCHOOL LEAVERS SELECTED ACROSS DIFFERENT WORKING PLACES IN THE SIX STATES OF SOUTHWEST NIGERIA. RESULTS CLEARLY REVEALED THAT MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE PRESENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN NIGERIA. MOST OF THE RESPONDENTS SUGGESTED PARTICIPATION OF EVERYONE IN THE ACT OF GOVERNANCE THAT FAVOR RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY, AND FREEDOM AND THAT THIS SHOULD BE ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE RESEARCHER THEREFORE RECOMMENDED A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT WILL INCORPORATE ALL THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY INTO THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, WHILE MARGINALIZATION AND NEGLECT OF THE POOR, WOMEN, YOUTH, AND RURAL DWELLERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED.
893	THEORETICALLY, THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON POLITICAL AGENCY THEORY TO FORMULATE HYPOTHESES. EMPIRICALLY, IT SHOWS THAT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE A ROLE IN EXPLAINING THE PREVALENCE OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN STATES. IN THE STATES, A SET OF DEMOCRACIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS RELATIVELY WELL ESTABLISHED AND THE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF DIFFERING ELECTORAL SYSTEMS AND REGIMES ARE ABSENT, INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES RELATING TO THE OPENNESS OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM INHIBIT CORRUPTION. THAT IS, OTHER THINGS EQUAL, THE EXTENT TO WHICH ASPIRING POLITICIANS CAN ENTER AND GAIN FINANCIAL BACKING, AND TO WHICH VOTERS CAN FOCUS THEIR VOTES ON POLICIES AND THEREBY HOLD INCUMBENT POLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR POLICY OUTCOMES AND FIND SUBSTITUTES FOR THEM IF DISSATISFIED WITH THOSE OUTCOMES, REDUCE CORRUPTION AS A GENERAL PROBLEM OF AGENCY. THESE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS ARE ESTIMATED IN THE PRESENCE OF CONTROLS FOR VARIABLES REPRESENTING OTHER APPROACHES.
894	CONCLUSIONS OF THE SIXTH IPCC REPORT, THE OUTCOME OF COP26 IN GLASGOW AND THE RECENT DECLARATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE COURTS REINFORCE THE NEED FOR SOPHISTICATION AND TECHNICAL DEEPENING IN THE PRACTICE OF CLIMATE LITIGATION THAT NECESSARILY NEEDS TO ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A STABLE CLIMATE AS HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE TEXT FOR SOME YEARS IN THE CONTEXT OF BRAZILIAN CLIMATE CHANGE LAW. TO THIS END, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MOST RECENT ELEMENTS DISCUSSED IN THE FIELD OF CLIMATE CHANGE LAW, WHICH IS EMINENTLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND NEEDS TO BE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND FORMULATED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENABLE THE REALIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE MOST IMPORTANT CLIMATE LITIGATION CASES IN BRAZIL PENDING BEFORE THE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL SUPREME COURT.
895	INDIGENOUS HIGHER EDUCATION GOVERNANCE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF DIVERSITY, EQUALITY AND INCLUSIVITY AT UNIVERSITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT INDIGENOUS STUDENT POPULATIONS OR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES. MANAGEMENT APPROACHES TO ESTABLISH INCLUSIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS ARE COMPLEX AND LITTLE GUIDANCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT UNIVERSITY MANAGERS TO ESTABLISH INDIGENOUS ADVISORY COUNCILS. WE DOCUMENT THE CREATION OF A UNIVERSITY INDIGENOUS ADVISORY COUNCIL INCORPORATING 11 INDIGENOUS NATIONALITIES. WE ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT PROCESS WITH THE ANALYTICAL LENSES OF PARTICIPATION AND INCLUSION; ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW; NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY; TRANSPARENCY; AND MUTUAL TRUST AND RESPECT. THIS STUDY PROVIDES HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY RESEARCHERS AND UNIVERSITY MANAGERS AND WITH A CLEAR ROADMAP TO ESTABLISH ROBUST INDIGENOUS UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE. IN DOING SO, WE AIM TO EMPOWER INDIGENOUS LEADERS TO CREATE POSITIVE IMPACT IN HIGHER EDUCATION, CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND RESEARCH FOR INDIGENOUS STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES.
896	WE EXTEND OUR WORLDWIDE RESEARCH ON PRIVATE EQUITY BY STUDYING THE DRIVERS OF GOING PRIVATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN EMERGING COUNTRIES (ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA). WE SELECT A LARGE SET OF CANDIDATE DRIVERS (FINANCIAL, GOVERNANCE, MACROECONOMICS, MICROECONOMICS, INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES) AND WE ANALYZE THEIR EFFECTS ON PERFORMANCE OVER THE SHORT AND LONG TERMS. TO CONDUCT OUR STUDY, WE USE CAPITAL IQ, THOMSON ONE BANKER, WORLD BANK AS DATABASES. WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURRENT LITERATURE BY DOING AN INVESTIGATION OF THE IMPACT OF MACROECONOMICS FACTORS AND INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS (POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY) ON THE BUYOUT PERFORMANCE. POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE RESULTS ARE OBTAINED. WE USE A SAMPLE OF 248 GOING PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, WHICH OCCURRED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2011. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT GDP GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO GENERATE PERFORMANCE IN GOING PRIVATE.
897	IN 2010, KENYA REVISED ITS CONSTITUTION TO INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO A CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT', ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA) REQUIREMENTS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SPECIALISED ENVIRONMENTAL COURT, THE ENVIRONMENT AND LAND COURT (ELC). AS THE ONLY CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED ENVIRONMENTAL COURT IN AFRICA, THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH THE ELC HAS APPLIED THE RIGHT TO A CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT AND ENFORCED THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR EIAS IN ITS RULINGS. OVERALL, IT DEMONSTRATES THAT IN THE SHORT PERIOD DURING WHICH THE COURT HAS EXISTED, THE ELC HAS DEVELOPED A ROBUST AND PROGRESSIVE JURISPRUDENCE, ESPECIALLY BY HOLDING GOVERNMENT POWER TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY FAILINGS IN CARRYING OUT EIAS AND IN UPHOLDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. IN ANALYSING THE WORKS OF THE ELC, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THREE RECENT CASES: LEBOO, KAMAU AND ACRAG.
898	OBJECTIVE. TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE MAIN ETHICAL DILEMMAS THAT ARE PRESENTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE DECISIONS IN TIMES OF WAR, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE ACTION FOR ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. METHODOLOGY. THE METHODOLOGY OF THE RESEARCH IS QUALITATIVE. WITH A SECOND ANALYTICAL PHASE, IN WHICH THE THE DECISIONS, MAINLY OF DOCTORS AND LAWYERS, IN TIMES OF WAR, ARE GOING TO BE STUDIED. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES ONE OF THE MAIN ETHICAL DILEMMAS FOR DOCTORS AND LAWYERS: THE APPLICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF EUGENICS IN HUMAN BEINGS, AS A MEDICAL PRACTICE AND AS A RULE OF LAW. PARTICULARLY IN COLOMBIA, SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, PRACTICES, NORMS AND ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AROUND THE CHOICE OF THE SUPERIOR RACE. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF COLOMBIA'S ETHICAL DILEMMAS, CONFERENCES, PRACTICES, AND EUGENICS STANDARDS
899	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO REFLECT ON THE USE OF LAW IN SPACES OF (POST) COLONIAL DOMINATION FROM THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF LARGE SCALE GOLD MINING IN COLOMBIA. THIS PROBLEM ARISES FROM THE CONTEXT OF THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY THAT HAS EXPANDED IN RECENT YEARS IN LATIN AMERICA, SEEING IT AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE MYTH OF DEVELOPMENT AND AS A CONTINUATION OF THE LEGACIES OF COLONIALISM. THE GROWING PRESENCE OF TRANSNATIONAL MINING COMPANIES UNDER THE AUSPICES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN A FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES OF (NEO) COLONIZATION, IN WHICH COLOMBIA HAS BEEN NO EXCEPTION. IT SEEKS TO REFLECT ON THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS MANAGER AND INTERMEDIARY OF THE TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS GOVERNMENT AND ON THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE LAW IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW MINING REGIME AND A NEW DEVELOPMENTAL STATE.
900	UKRAINE'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS STILL SHACKLED BY ITS SOVIET PAST. DESPITE GAINING INDEPENDENCE IN 1991, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS NEW SOVEREIGN STATE COULD NOT USHER IN OVERNIGHT A NEW JUDICIAL SYSTEM FIRMLY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE AUTHOR ASSESSES CURRENT REFORM EFFORTS IN THE UKRAINIAN JUSTICE SECTOR IN LIGHT OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN UNION AND COUNCIL OF EUROPE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STEPS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE. KEY REFORMS ARE ANALYSED INCLUDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE "SMALL JUSTICE REFORM" OF 2002 AND THE DRAFT LAW ON THE JUDICIARY AND THE STATUS OF JUDGES. AS UKRAINE DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPLICIT STRATEGY ON JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS, WHICH MAKES ANY SUCH ANALYSIS OF RECENT JUSTICE REFORMS MORE DIFFICULT, ITS OBLIGATIONS IN THIS AREA UNDER SEVERAL EU-UKRAINE TREATIES AND JOINT PROJECTS WILL BE ANALYSED.
901	IN RECENT YEARS, MEDIA COLUMNISTS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN REDEFINING AUSTRALIAN CONSERVATISM. ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT IS JANET ALBRECHTSEN. USING HER CRITIQUE OF A BILL OF RIGHTS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THIS NEW AUSTRALIAN CONSERVATISM REJECTS OR REVERSES CORE ELEMENTS OF TRADITIONAL CONSERVATISM. UTILITARIANISM EXCHANGES THE TRANSCENDENT FOR THE SOCIAL. EQUALITY AND DEMOCRACY REPLACE ELITISM. ELITES WERE MINORITIES, ALBEIT ONES WITH LEADERSHIP VIRTUE. NOW MINORITIES OF ANY SORT THREATEN EQUALITY AND UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY. THESE CHANGES REFLECT BROADER CHANGES IN SOCIETY ITSELF. IN THIS SENSE, CONSERVATISM HAS MADE PEACE WITH MODERNITY, HOSTILITY TO WHICH ORIGINALLY PROMPTED ITS BIRTH. NOW THE ENEMY IS INTERNATIONALISM OR POSTMODERNITY, THE TWO OFTEN INTERCHANGEABLE. ALBRECHTSEN'S HOSTILITY TO A BILL OF RIGHTS MATCHES HER REJECTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONS THAT THREATEN THE NATION-STATE AND ITS GUARANTEE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
902	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE ACTUAL INTERACTION OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC IMMUNITIES IN ANCIENT ATHENS, AND ARGUES THAT ANCIENT DEMOCRACY ECHOED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN TRADITIONALLY ASSUMED THE GENERAL DYNAMICS AND NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY. WITHOUT DENYING THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES THAT DISTINGUISH ANCIENT DEMOCRATIC ATHENS FROM MODERN DEMOCRACY, I ANALYZE THE ATHENIAN SITUATION IN LIGHT OF HABERMAS'S THEORY OF DELIBERATION, AND ARGUE THAT CIVIC AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES IN ATHENS WERE DEMOCRACY-ENABLING BECAUSE THEY UNDERGIRDED THE EXERCISE OF COLLECTIVE POLITICAL POWER. IN ATHENS, THE CONSIDERABLE RESPECT ACCORDED TO THE RULE OF LAW (AS DISTINCT FROM MAJORITY RULE), LEGITIMATED PRIVATE AUTONOMY AND CREATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MADE COLLECTIVE SELF-GOVERNMENT POSSIBLE. THUS, THIS ARTICLE CONTRADICTS THE DICHOTOMOUS APPROACH TO LIBERTY HELD BY SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT CRITICS OF ATHENS SUCH AS ISAIAH BERLIN AND BENJAMIN CONSTANT.
903	A DISCERNIBLE RIFT BETWEEN THE RHETORIC OF POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE REAL POLICY OF AUTHORITARIAN POPULISTS - THE RHETORIC FOCUSED ON POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AS A FACADE AND A UTILITARIAN ARGUMENT JUSTIFYING THE INTRODUCTION OF COUNTER-CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THROUGH STATUTE LAWS - CAPTURED APEX COURTS TURNED INTO USEFUL DEVICES OF POWER CONSOLIDATION - THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AND THE SUPREME COURT - THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AS AN 'INVERTED COURT' USED INCREASINGLY OFTEN TO ACTIVELY SHAPE THE GOVERNMENT'S EUROSCEPTIC POLICY - A DOUBLE FACE OF THE SUPREME COURT - THE NEW CHAMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT INTRODUCED TO BE POLITICALLY ABUSED BY AUTHORITARIAN POPULISTS - SYSTEMIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TWO CAPTURED APEX COURTS HAVE A SYNERGY EFFECT WITH REGARD TO THE PROCESS OF THE DENORMATIVISATION OF THE CONSTITUTION - THE DEEPENING POLITICISATION OF THE APEX COURTS CREATES A FAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR FURTHER RULE OF LAW DETERIORATION.
904	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE EFFECT OF THE UNITED STATES (US) FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA) ON US MULTINATIONAL FIRMS' FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI). UNLIKE PRIOR STUDIES THAT FOCUSED ON THE PASSAGE OF THE FCPA, OUR STUDY EXAMINES HOW THE ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE FCPA AFFECTS FIRMS' FOREIGN INVESTMENT DECISIONS. WE SHOW THAT INITIAL FCPA ENFORCEMENT IN A HOST COUNTRY TRIGGERS MNES TO REASSESS THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF BEING TARGETED, WHICH IN TURN HAS A STRONG DETERRENCE EFFECT ON SUBSEQUENT US FDI GROWTH IN THE HOST COUNTRY. THIS DETERRENCE EFFECT IS STRONGER FOR HOST COUNTRIES WITH A WEAKER RULE OF LAW AND MORE SEVERE CORRUPTION ISSUES. WE DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT FDI RELOCATION DUE TO FCPA ENFORCEMENT. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF FCPA ENFORCEMENT IN THE GLOBAL MARKET FOR FDI.
905	AFTER THE GRANT OF THE 1977 "AMNESTY" TO TACKLE CORRUPTION IN THE POLICE FORCE AND CIVIL SERVICE, THE QUESTION OF AMNESTY HAS RECENTLY ARISEN ONCE AGAIN IN HONG KONG. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER IT IS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE (CE) TO GRANT AN AMNESTY BEFORE CONVICTION, SPECIFICALLY IN THE FORM OF A DIRECTION TO THE SECRETARY FOR JUSTICE OR THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS NOT TO PROSECUTE. IT TRACES THE ORIGIN OF AMNESTY, AND EXPLAINS THE INHERENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS OF AMNESTY AND PARDON. IT EXAMINES THE SCOPE OF THE CE'S PARDON POWER UNDER ART 48(12) OF THE BASIC LAW AND THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF PROSECUTORIAL INDEPENDENCE ENSHRINED IN ART 63. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE VIABILITY OF OTHER POSSIBLE FORMS OF "AMNESTY" UNDER HONG KONG'S CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.
906	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-LEVEL CORRUPTION SCANDALS ON THE FUTURE OF A DOMINANT PARTY DEPEND ON THE EXISTENCE OF A RULE OF LAW SYSTEM BASED ON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE ARTICLE WILL STUDY TWO EXAMPLES FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE TO CONCRETISE ITS THEORETICAL CLAIMS: THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY PARTY IN ITALY, WHICH WAS THE DOMINANT PARTY FROM 1948 TO 1992, AND THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY IN TURKEY. THE COMPARISON WILL BE BASED ON AN INSTITUTIONALIST PERSPECTIVE. THE FIRST PART TRIES TO PROVIDE A THEORETICAL CLARIFICATION OF THE CONCEPTS OF PREDOMINANT PARTY SYSTEMS AND CORRUPTION. THE SECOND PART DISCUSSES WHETHER THE TURKISH AND ITALIAN PARTY SYSTEMS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS PREDOMINANT AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE SYSTEMS. THE FINAL SECTION SEEKS TO DRAW OUT SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS AND THE EFFECTS CORRUPTION HAS ON THEM.
907	THERE IS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF HOW HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DOCUMENT DECISIONS TO PROVIDE COERCIVE MEDICAL AND DENTAL HEALTHCARE FOR PERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. DRAWING ON SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES, WE ANALYSED 28 NORWEGIAN DECISION DOCUMENTS TO EXPLORE HOW PROFESSIONALS ACCOUNT FOR COERCIVE HEALTHCARE DECISIONS. THE PROFESSIONALS PRESENTED CLEAR-CUT MEDICALIZED AND MORALLY NEUTRAL 'COERCIVE HEALTHCARE CASES' IN FAVOUR OF COERCION. THEY TYPICALLY EMPHASIZED THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF HEALTHCARE PROVISION TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PATIENT'S HEALTH. HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL JUDGMENTS OF THE NECESSITY OF COERCION IN INDIVIDUAL CASES WERE LARGELY OBSCURED. PROFESSIONALS' CASE PRESENTATION WAS FACILITATED BY A STANDARDIZED DECISION FORM. WE SUGGEST THAT PROFESSIONALS' DOCUMENTARY ACCOUNTS CONSTITUTE A ROUTINIZED 'PRESCRIPTIVE' PRACTICE THAT EXPRESSES THE 'VOICE OF MEDICINE'. WE QUESTION WHETHER THE CURRENT PRACTICE PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW OR IN THE WORST CASE MAY SERVE TO LEGITIMIZE UNLAWFUL USE OF COERCION IN HEALTHCARE.
908	IN THIS ARTICLE WE PROBE THE TENSION BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND STATE-BUILDING. GOVERNANCE STRESSES DIVERSIFICATION, REFLEXIVE RATIONALITY, HETERARCHIC INTERACTION, NEGOTIATION AND COORDINATION, WHEREAS STATE-BUILDING EMPHASIZES CENTRALIZATION, PROCEDURAL RATIONALITY, HIERARCHIC ORDER, CONTROL AND REGULATION. DESPITE THE CONFLICT RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR RESPECTIVE ESSENCES, THERE IS SOME BLENDING BETWEEN THE TWO. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PROCESS OF STATE-BUILDING IS SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE PROCESS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. ON THE OTHER HAND, A STRONG STATE IS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE FOOTSTONE FOR GOVERNANCE BECAUSE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNANCE FAILURE AND THE NECESSITY OF META-GOVERNANCE. SUCH CONFLICTS AND BLENDINGS CONSTRUCT THE TENSION AND DIALECTIC BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND STATE BUILDING. WITH RESPECT TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS DIALECTIC, IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP SUCH TENSION RIGHTLY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
909	INTERDISCIPLINARY, WIDE-RANGING, AND FLEXIBLE, CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP IS NOTHING LIKE ITS ANTECEDENTS THIRTY YEARS AGO. IN SIGNIFICANT PART, IT OWES THIS MODERN SOPHISTICATION TO TAX. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT OWES ITS INTER-DISCIPLINARY CHARACTER TO THE WORK OF HIROSHI KANEKO. WHEN KANEKO CAME TO JAPANESE TAX LAW IN THE LATE 1950S, HE CAME TO A FIELD LIKE MOST OTHER JAPANESE LEGAL FIELDS-INTELLECTUALLY ISOLATED, AND OVERWHELMINGLY DOCTRINAL. THROUGH A NOVEL INTERPRETIVE THEORY, KANEKO CREATED A WAY FOR TAX SCHOLARS TO DEBATE THE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE OF TAX AND INCOME. IN THE PROCESS, HE (A) CREATED A FIELD (TAX LAW) WHERE LITTLE HAD EXISTED BEFORE, (B) BROUGHT PUBLIC FINANCE AND THE COMPREHENSIVE TAX BASE TO THE FOREFRONT, (C) KEPT JAPANESE PUBLIC LAW PRACTICE ANCHORED FIRMLY IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND YET (D) OPENED THE DOOR TO SOCIAL SCIENCE IN LAW MORE GENERALLY.
910	MEXICO IS A FAILING STATE, LANGUISHING UNDER A DEEPLY ENTRENCHED SYSTEM OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION THAT UNDERMINES THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND COMPROMISES MEXICO'S LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY CAPABILITIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CULTURE OF CORRUPTION THAT PERVADES THE STATE AND FRUSTRATES THE RULE OF LAW IN MEXICO, EXAMINING HOW THE POLITICAL ELITES, THE JUDICIARY, AND POLICE OFFICIALS EMBRACE CORRUPTION AS A PRIMARY MEANS FOR CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND FOR ACQUIRING PERSONAL WEALTH. IT IS AN EXAMINATION OF A COUNTRY OVERWHELMED BY A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCE THAT HAS GROWN DEPENDENT ON CORRUPTION IN ORDER TO FUNCTION. BUT SUCH A SYSTEM CANNOT SUSTAIN ITSELF INDEFINITELY, AND THE SIGNS OF THE MEXICAN STATE'S COLLAPSE ARE BECOMING MORE APPARENT IN THE WAKE OF UNPRECEDENTED POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VIOLENCE AT THE HANDS OF CORRUPT ACTORS AND MEXICAN DRUG LORDS.
911	AT THE START OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, POLITICAL AND LEGAL REFORMERS INITIATED FAR-RANGING CHANGES IN THE AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY IN CITIES SUCH AS CHICAGO, WHERE VIOLENT CRIME RATES WERE HIGH AND WHERE THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT WAS ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL. YET LAW ENFORCERS RARELY CONVICTED KILLERS, MORE THAN THREE-FOURTHS OF WHOM WENT UNPUNISHED. EVEN IN HOMICIDE CASES IN WHICH THE IDENTITY OF KILLERS WAS CERTAIN AND THE POLICE MADE ARRESTS, JURORS TYPICALLY EXONERATED OR ACQUITTED KILLERS. USING POLICE AND COURT RECORDS AND TRACING THE LEGAL OUTCOMES OF NEARLY SIX THOUSAND CASES, THIS ESSAY ANALYZES PATTERNS OF CONVICTION IN CHICAGO HOMICIDE CASES BETWEEN 1875 AND 1920 AND ARGUES THAT A BLEND OF GENDER-, RACE-, AND CLASS-BASED NOTIONS OF JUSTICE TRUMPED THE RULE OF LAW, PRODUCING LOW HOMICIDE CONVICTION RATES DURING A PERIOD OF SOARING VIOLENCE.
912	THE AUTHORS EXAMINE HOW COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS SYSTEMATICALLY MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DRIVERS OF THE PERCEIVED VALUE THAT CONSUMERS DERIVE FROM VISITING A BRAND MANUFACTURER'S WEB SITE. THEY TEST HYPOTHESES ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 8886 CONSUMERS FROM 23 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, INVOLVING 30 WEB SITES OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS COMPANIES. THEY FIND THAT THE EFFECT OF PRIVACY/SECURITY PROTECTION ON PERCEIVED VALUE IS STRONGER FOR PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES THAT ARE HIGH ON NATIONAL IDENTITY GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO WHETHER THERE IS CULTURAL CONGRUITY BETWEEN THE SITE AND THEMSELVES. PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN MORE INDIVIDUALISTIC COUNTRIES GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO PLEASURE, TO PRIVACY/SECURITY PROTECTION, AND TO CUSTOMIZATION IN THEIR PERCEIVED VALUE JUDGMENTS THAN PEOPLE FROM COLLECTIVISTIC COUNTRIES. THE AUTHORS DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS FOR WEB SITE DESIGN STRATEGIES.
913	USING THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM), THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION ON THE STABILITY OF 157 BANKS IN 8 ASEAN COUNTRIES FROM 2010 TO 2020. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION NEGATIVELY HURTS BANK STABILITY, AND THIS EFFECT WILL BE IMPROVED IF IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF GOOD INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THIS IS VERIFIED AGAIN IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ASPECTS. CORRUPTION CONTROL, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS, WHILE REGULATORY QUALITY HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL THREE MEASURES OF BANK STABILITY, ZSCORE, STANDARDIZED ZSCORE, AND NON-PERFORMING LOANS (NPL). WITH THE ABOVE RESULTS, THE STUDY RECOMMENDS THAT NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TO INCREASE THE STABILITY OF BANKS IN PROMOTING FINANCIAL INCLUSION.
914	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RELATION BETWEEN COUNTRY-LEVEL AUDIT PROFESSION DEVELOPMENT (APD) AND BANK LOAN CONTRACTING AROUND THE WORLD. USING A SAMPLE OF BANK LOAN DATA FROM 35 COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT STRONGER APD IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE FAVORABLE LOAN TERMS, SUCH AS LOWER LOAN SPREADS, FEWER COVENANTS, AND LARGER LOAN AMOUNTS. THESE EFFECTS ARE STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WITH A WEAKER RULE OF LAW. WE ALSO FIND THAT STRONGER APD ATTRACTS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LENDERS PARTICIPATING IN LOANS AND MORE FOREIGN LENDERS LEADING LOANS. A BREAKDOWN OF APD INTO THREE SUBCATEGORIES, NAMELY, AUDITOR EDUCATION, AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE AND LIABILITY, AND AUDITOR OVERSIGHT, REVEALS THAT ALL THREE INFLUENCE VARIOUS CONTRACTING TERMS. WE ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT STRONGER APD IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF TIMELY LOSS RECOGNITION. COLLECTIVELY, OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT APD IMPROVES BANK LOAN CONTRACTING TERMS.
915	WHAT INFLUENCE THE CHOICE OF HOST COUNTRY WHEN CHINESE FIRM MAKE CROSS-BORDER MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS (M&A)? ACCORDING TO 1,051 CHINESE CROSS-BORDER M&A TRANSACTIONS IN THE YEARS 2000-2015 LISTED IN BVD-ZEPHYR DATABASE, WE FIND THAT CULTURE DISTANCE, INSTITUTION AND TAX ARE THE THREE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS: 1) CHINESE FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE HOST COUNTRY WITH CLOSE CULTURE WHEN CONDUCT CROSS-BORDER M&AS. 2) CHINESE FIRMS TEND TO CHOOSE M&A METHOD TO ENTER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE STRONGER INSTITUTIONS. AMONG THE SIX SPECIFIC INSTITUTION FACTORS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY), CHINESE FIRMS CARE MORE ABOUT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND REGULATORY QUALITY. 3) LOW-TAX COUNTRIES ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO CHINESE FIRM CROSS-BORDER M&AS.
916	SINCE 2013, AT LEAST 47 COUNTRIES FROM AUSTRALIA TO UZBEKISTAN HAVE ENACTED LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO STOP THEIR CITIZENS FROM JOINING EXTREMIST ARMED GROUPS SUCH AS THE ISLAMIC STATE. A MAJORITY OF THESE "FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTER" MEASURES WERE ENACTED TO COMPLY WITH UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 2178 OF SEPTEMBER 2014. IN A GRAVE OMISSION, RESOLUTION 2178 DOES NOT LIMIT THE ACTIONS THAT GOVERNMENTS MAY DESIGNATE AS "TERRORISM" OR "TERRORIST", LEAVING THEM FREE TO CRAFT DANGEROUSLY OPENENDED DEFINITIONS. AT RISK ARE NON-VIOLENT PROTESTERS, JOURNALISTS, POLITICAL OPPONENTS, CIVIL SOCIETY MEMBERS, AND ETHNIC OR RELIGIOUS GROUPS, PARTICULARLY MUSLIMS. THE "FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTER" MEASURES THAT COULD TARGET THEM INCLUDE WARRANTLESS SEARCHES, PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE, TRAVEL BANS, LOSS OF DUAL CITIZENSHIP, CONVICTIONS IN SHAM TRIALS, AND HARSH PUNISHMENTS INCLUDING DEATH. COLLECTIVELY, THESE MEASURES ERODE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW.
917	THE FIGHT AGAINST ORGANISED CRIME GENERALLY REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF COOPERATION BETWEEN STATES. IN THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHOSE INTERNAL SPACE IS BORDERLESS ON ALMOST EVERY ISSUE, THIS LEVEL OF COOPERATION IS UNAVOIDABLE. BEING AWARE OF THIS, MEMBER STATES HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS FIGHT TOGETHER. THE CREATION OF NEW COOPERATION TOOLS AND THE USE OF CERTAIN AGENCIES HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT STEPS, BUT ARE FAR FROM ENOUGH. TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOME THE DISTRUST GROWN OUT OF DEFENDING A SOVEREIGNTY THAT IS, TODAY, MORE IMAGINARY THAN REAL AND TO BRING ABOUT GREATER HARMONISATION OF SECURITY STANDARDS, PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTING INCREASE IN MUTUAL TRUST IS CRUCIAL FOR MORE EFFECTIVE JOINT ACTION AGAINST THIS TYPE OF CRIME.
918	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES AUSTRALIAN TREATY MAKING WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC. PATTERNS OF AUSTRALIAN TREATY MAKING WITH SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT TO THOSE WITH SOUTH WEST PACIFIC COUNTRIES AND THE DIFFERENCE IS CONTINUING TO DEEPEN. TREATIES WITH THE FORMER ARE PRIMARILY BILATERAL AND COMMERCIALLY ORIENTED, WHEREAS THOSE WITH THE LATTER ARE PLURILATERAL AND ORIENTED TO NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS A MAJOR GAP IN AUSTRALIAN SUBREGIONAL TREATY ACTIVITY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES. A COALESCENCE OF ISSUES IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY CATEGORIES IS OCCURRING AND THE NEW DIRECTION IN AUSTRALIAN REGIONAL TREATY MAKING FOR BOTH SUBREGIONS IS TO STRENGTHEN CAPACITY TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW IN NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. COMMERCIAL TREATY MAKING REMAINS AND IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE THE STRONGEST AREA OF TREATY ACTIVITY.
919	INITIAL REACTIONS TO THE JUDGEMENT AGAINST ENTREPRENEUR. MIKHAIL KHODOROVSKII ON 31 MAY 2005 FOCUSED ON CRITICISING VIOLATIONS AGAINST BASIC PRECEPTS OF RULE OF LAW. SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPEAL TO THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO REVIEW SUCH VIOLATIONS OF BASIC RIGHTS BY THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN STRASBOURG REMAINS THE ONLY INSTANCE OF CONTROL. THE COURT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF DECISIONS AGAINST THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN WHICH A NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS WERE CRITICISED. BASED ON THESE PRECEDENTS, IT APPEARS THAT A CONDEMNATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CAN EXPECTED IN THE KHODOROVSKII CASE AS WELL. WHETHER IT WILL COME TO THIS IS UNCLEAR GIVEN CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE.
920	THE STUDY'S GOAL IS TO EXPLORE AND SCRUTINIZE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN ACHIEVING, MANIPULATING, AND MODIFYING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SAUDI ARABIA. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE MEASURES PRIOR AND AFTER VISION 2030, BY USING ARDL AND DYNAMIC ARDL SIMULATED ECONOMETRIC APPROACHES. ON CONTRARY TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE, THE EMPIRICAL ESTIMATIONS HAVE REPORTED THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. FURTHER, THE FINDINGS HAVE ENDORSED THE SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT OF VOICE OF ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION CONTROL. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF POST VISION 2030 HAVE ILLUSTRATED THAT INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION OF GOVERNANCE HAS SUBSTANTIAL AND POSITIVE COEFFICIENTS, WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY AND GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO UNDERTAKE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SAUDI ARABIA. IN TURN OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS, THIS STUDY EMPOWERS ADMINISTRATION IN MONITORING CURRENT STRATEGIES AND LATER DECISIONMAKING.
921	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW ACCOUNT OF THE RISE OF THE RANKED NATION-STATE THROUGH A GENEALOGY OF THE CATEGORY OF COUNTRY RISK, WHICH EMERGED IN THE 1970S AS PART OF A RESPONSE TO THE EXPLOSION OF SOVEREIGN BORROWING OF PETRODOLLARS BY GLOBAL SOUTH AND EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES. INCORPORATING INTANGIBLE QUALITIES LIKE POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC THROUGH A VERSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCANNING, COUNTRY RISK RATINGS QUANTIFIED BOTH THE ABILITY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF SOVEREIGNS TO REPAY THEIR DEBTS. ADOPTED BY THE US FEDERAL RESERVE AS A MEANS OF IMPOSING THE RULE OF LAW ON GLOBAL FINANCE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE THIRD WORLD DEBT CRISIS, COUNTRY RISK RETURNED IN THE RESEARCH OF THE 1990S AS A PROXY FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE, TRANSFORMING THE SUBJECTIVE IMPRESSIONS OF MANAGERS AND BANKERS INTO OBJECTIVE REALITIES WITH POLICY EFFECTS.
922	THE WORKPLACE IS A FOCAL POINT FOR DEBATES ABOUT RELIGION AND PUBLIC LIFE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE QUESTION OF RELIGION AT WORK, AND HOW TO FAIRLY RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS IT GENERATES. SPECIFICALLY, IT ADVOCATES FOR THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TO ADDRESS THESE CONFLICTS. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION REFERS TO A SET OF DISPUTE PROCESSING METHODS, MAINLY ARBITRATION AND MEDIATION. UNLIKE LITIGATION, THESE PROCEDURES RELY ON THE CONSENT AND COOPERATION OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. I ARGUE THAT ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS BEST CONCEIVED OF AS A DESIRABLE COMPLEMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW RATHER THAN A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE. IT CONVEYS A DISTINCTIVE APPROACH TO PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, WHICH IS ATTENTIVE TO INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IT FRAMES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISPUTANTS IN A COOPERATIVE WAY. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION IS THUS A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD.
923	USING RECENT CHINESE DATA ON OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI) (2003-11), THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT CHINESE OFDI HAS EXPANDED IN BOTH DISTANT DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT CHINESE INVESTORS ARE ATTRACTED TO COUNTRIES WITH LARGE MARKET SIZE, RICH RESOURCES AND STRATEGIC ASSETS, AND DEMAND A SOUND LEGAL SYSTEM BUT AVOID COUNTRIES WITH THE BEST RULE OF LAW. CHINESE INVESTORS DO NOT DIRECTLY RESPOND TO POLITICAL RISK AND CORRUPTION. HOWEVER, THEY FAVOUR POLITICALLY STABLE LOCATIONS WHEN SEEKING MARKETS AND CARE ABOUT POLITICAL STABILITY AND CORRUPTION CONTROL WHEN SEEKING RESOURCES. INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE INVESTMENT DECISION MAKING PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL INVESTMENTS, BUT THE MODERATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IS INFLUENTIAL FOR THE ACTUAL INVESTMENTS. CHINESE INVESTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEEK MARKETS AND RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WITH CAREFUL EVALUATION OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.
924	THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF METHODOLOGICAL DIRECTION IN POLITICAL THEORY, GIVING A PROMINENT ROLE TO CONFLICTING INTERESTS IN THE STUDY OF AREAS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE WHICH ARE APPARENTLY CHARACTERIZED BY AN ETHICAL CONSENSUS COMPARABLE TO THAT STUDIED IN IDEALIST THEORIES OF JUSTICE. THE RISE OF IDEOLOGIES, IN PARTICULAR, MUST BE EXAMINED WITH AN EYE TO THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE FAVORED. THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS RETURN TO A CONFLICT-CENTERED PROBLEMATIC IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE QUESTION OF THE APPARENT CONSENSUS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND BY THE NECESSARY ATTENTION TO THOSE INTERESTS WHICH HARMED IN SOME AREAS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS AN APPARENT CONSENSUS ON LIBERAL VALUES. THE EXAMPLES ARE DRAWN FROM THE DOMINANT LIBERAL IDEOLOGY CONCERNING PORNOGRAPHY (CONSIDERED AS A CULTURAL MODEL) AND SOME QUESTIONS IN BIOETHICS.
925	THE TENDENCY OF CLASSICAL POLITICS TO EMBED THE INDIVIDUAL IN UNIVERSAL AND TRANSCENDENTAL PATTERNS OF ACTION FOLLOWED IN PART FROM THE RECOGNITION OF THE FUTILITY OF UNPREDICTABLE ACTION ORIENTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S TRANSIENT PERSONAL FUTURE. BY CONTRAST, F. A. HAYEK ARGUES FOR LIBERALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE IT IS INSTRUMENTAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF HUMAN ENDS. MICHAEL OAKESHOTT, HOWEVER, CLAIMS THAT FREEDOM IS A VALUE IN ITSELF, AND THAT LIBERALISM SHOULD EMPHASIZE MORAL AUTONOMY BECAUSE THE MORAL LIFE IS PUBLIC AND NOT ORIENTED TO EXTERNAL ENDS. THE MORAL LIFE INTIMATES A FORM OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN ACTION, AND SELF-SUFFICIENT ACTION IS TIMELESS IN THE SENSE OF BEING INDIFFERENT TO EITHER THE PAST OR THE FUTURE. OAKESHOTT RETURNS LIBERALISM TO THE PROBLEMS OF CLASSICAL POLITICS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO THE DICTATORIAL IMPOSITION OF A SINGLE SUBSTANTIVE GOOD.
926	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW ASEAN HAS REACTED TO THE MILITARY COUP IN MYANMAR THE FEBRUARY 1, 2021 COUP WAS APPALLING BECAUSE MYANMAR WAS PROGRESSING TOWARD DEMOCRACY ESPECIALLY SINCE SUU KYI'S NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD) WON A LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN THE 2015 GENERAL ELECTION. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH ASEAN TRIES TO ADOPT 'CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT' TOWARDS MYANMAR, ITS APPROACHES REMAIN INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT BASICALLY STILL MAINTAINS THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF ITS MEMBER STATES. ASEAN MUST RECOGNIZE THAT REGIONAL STABILITY DEPENDS ON RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND RULE OF LAW WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ASEAN NEEDS TO TRANSFORM ITS INEFFECTIVE APPROACHES TOWARD MORE ACTIVE RESPONSE BY GRADUALLY INTERNALIZING THE NEW CONCEPT OF 'RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT' (R2P) AND ACTIVELY PUT PRESSURES ON THE MILITARY TO RESTORE DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY.
927	MOVING BEYOND THE CONUNDRUM OF EXPLANATION, USUALLY PORTRAYED AS A TRADE-OFF AGAINST ACCURACY, THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE RECENT EMERGENCE OF EXPLAINABLE AI TO THE LEGAL "RIGHT TO AN EXPLANATION", SITUATING THE NEED FOR AN EXPLANATION IN THE UNDERLYING RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE OF CONTESTABILITY. INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE OF CAUSAL OR LOGICAL EXPLANATIONS, THE ARTICLE THEN REVISITS THE METHODENSTREIT, WHOSE OUTCOME HAS RESULTED IN THE QUANTIFIABIL-ITY OF ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, THUS HIDING THE QUALIFICATION THAT NECESSARILY PRECEDES ANY AND ALL QUANTIFICATION. FINALLY, THE PAPER PROPOSES TO USE THE QUANTIFICATION THAT IS INHERENT IN MACHINE LEARNING TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS THAT RESIST QUANTIFICATION AND REQUIRE SITUATED INQUIRY AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH. FOR THIS, THE PAPER EXPLORES CLIFFORD GEERTZ'S NO-TION OF EXPLICATION AS A CONCEPTUAL TOOL FOCUSED ON DISCERNMENT AND JUDGMENT RATHER THAN CALCULATION AND RECKONING.
928	CONTRACTUAL NULLITIES ARE THE RESULT OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH A RULE OF LAW. THIS OBSERVATION, COMMON TO DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, IS RELEVANT TO PUBLIC CONTRACTS THAT LACK A SPECIFIC POSITIVE REGULATION ON THE SUBJECT. THIS ALLOWS TO ASSESS CONTRACTUAL PATHOLOGIES FROM A CLASSIC CLASSIFICATION THAT DISTINGUISHES THE SUBJECTIVE NULLITIES (PERTAINING TO BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONTRACTOR), THE OBJECTIVE NULLITIES (REFERRING TO THE ILLEGAL OBJECT AND CAUSE OF THE CONTRACT), AND THE ADDITIONAL NULLITIES DERIVED FROM FORMAL VICES. DESPITE A REFERRAL TO THE CIVIL CODE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NULLITY AND VOIDABILITY, AS WELL AS FOR THE APPRECIATION OF DIFFERENT GROUNDS FOR NULLITY, THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACT IMPOSE SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS DERIVED FROM THE NATURE OF THE AFFECTED INTERESTS, THE CONTRACTUAL GOOD FAITH PRINCIPLE, THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLICITY AND COMPETITION, THE REASONABLENESS INHERENT TO ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS, AND THE SPECIAL INTERPRETATION OF CONTRACTS.
929	DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION IS ONE OF THE BASES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THUS SHOULD BE FOUND THROUGHOUT ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE STATE, INDUCING THE JUDICIAL ONE. ONE OF THE WAYS TO MEASURE THIS KIND OF PARTICIPATION COULD BE THROUGH ANALYZING THE POSSIBILITIES OF CITIZENS TO ACCESS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. THIS ACCESS CAN BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT, INDIVIDUAL OR COLLECTIVE, AND COULD DIFFER WITHIN THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE FOLLOWING PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE INDIRECT PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS OF GERMANY, BRAZIL AND FRANCE. AT THE END, IT WILL BE NOTICE THAT THE ELEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION IS USUALLY CONFLICTING WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE WORK IN THE COURTS. FURTHERMORE, IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SOME OF THE INTERNAL DESIGNS OF THE COURTS, MADE FOR ENSURING THIS KIND OF PARTICIPATION, ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED BY THE COURTS' INTERNAL REGULATIONS.
930	THE POPULAR VIEW THAT THE RESULT OF THE VOTING FOR IMPOSING DEATH PENALTY AT THE TOKYO TRIAL WAS SIX TO FIVE NEEDS TO BE QUALIFIED. FIRST, ONLY TEN JUDGES TOOK PART IN THE VOTE, AS THE JUDGE OF FRANCE HENRI BERNARD ABSTAINED. SECOND, VOTING RESULTS FOR THE SEVEN CULPRITS WHO WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH VARIED, WITH SOME SIX TO FOUR AND THE OTHERS SEVEN TO THREE. FOR EXAMPLE, HIROTA KOKI SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A VOTING RESULT OF SIX TO FOUR, WHILE TOJO HIDEKI WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH BY A VOTE OF SEVEN TO THREE. ALTHOUGH THE JUDGES AT THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL FOR THE FAR EAST, TOKYO DIFFERED IN THEIR OPINIONS ON CERTAIN SPECIFIC ISSUES, THEY ALL ADHERED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE FAITHFULLY, WHICH WARRANTED THE LEGITIMACY OF THEIR JUDGMENT ON THE BASIS OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
931	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES WHY LOCAL POLICE OFFICERS CHOOSE TO COMPLY OR TO RESIST THE POLICE REFORMS STIPULATED BY AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEBUILDING MISSION OPERATING IN THEIR COUNTRY. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND IMPACT OF LOCAL AGENCY AND SHINE LIGHT ON LOCAL ACTORS' COMPLIANCE DECISIONS, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES TWO EXAMPLES OF POLICE REFORM OF THE EU RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THREE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PEACEBUILDING AND COMPLIANCE LITERATURES. FIRST, IT FORMULATES AND TESTS CAUSAL MECHANISMS SHOWING EXACTLY HOW LOCAL ACTORS' MOTIVATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE - LEGITIMACY, COERCION AND REWARD-SEEKING - ARE CAUSALLY LINKED TO COMPLIANCE. SECOND, IT SHOWS THAT LEGITIMACY, COERCION, AND REWARD-SEEKING DO NOT INFLUENCE COMPLIANCE DIRECTLY, BUT ONLY THROUGH THE HYPOTHESISED INTERVENING VARIABLES. FINALLY DEMONSTRATES THAT WHILE LEGITIMACY MATTERS TO LOCAL COMPLIANCE CHOICES, IT DOES SO ONLY IN SPECIFIC CONTEXTS AND SITUATIONS.
932	HOW DO PROPERTY RIGHTS BECOME SECURE? HOW DOES RULE OF LAW TAKE HOLD IN AN ECONOMY? THE AUTHOR USES AN ORIGINAL SURVEY OF 516 FIRMS IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, AS WELL AS INTERVIEW-BASED CASE STUDIES, TO REEXAMINE THESE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY. MOST STATES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD LACK THE REQUISITE TIME HORIZONS AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY TO MAKE THE CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS EMPHASIZED IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT FIRMS CAN ENFORCE THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHOUT RESORT TO MAFIAS BY FORMING ALLIANCES WITH STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS FOREIGN ACTORS, COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND LABOR. THESE STAKEHOLDERS CAN IMPOSE COSTS ON THE POTENTIAL AGGRESSORS THROUGH DIVERSE POLITICAL STRATEGIES, ALLOWING FIRMS TO DEFEND THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS NOT ONLY FROM PRIVATE PREDATORS BUT ALSO FROM THE STATE. THE ARTICLE EVALUATES THIS "BOTTOM-UP" THEORY OF SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS AGAINST EXISTING STATE-BASED THEORIZING.
933	THE PRESENT WORK PROPOSES A REFLECTION ON THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LIVES OF CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS STATE USES LIBERALISM AS THE ART OF GOVERNING AND BECOMES THE MANAGER OF HUMAN "HAPPINESS." FOR THAT, A BRIEF STUDY IS MADE IN THE BOOKS OF GIORGIO AGAMBEN AND MICHEL FOUCAULT, ANALYZING THE CONCEPTS OF STATE OF EXCEPTION AND BIOPOLITICS, RESPECTIVELY DEVELOPED BY THEM. IT RETURNS TO THE FORM OF EXCLUSION SUFFERED BY HOMO SACER, AS AGAMBEN TEACHES US, COMPARING IT WITH THE "BANDIT" OF OUR DAY, ALSO EXCLUDED FROM SOCIETY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. FINALLY, THE FUNCTION OF LAW, USED AS AN INSTRUMENT TO LEGITIMIZE CRUELTY AND INTERESTS THAT DO NOT CONFORM TO THE GENERAL WILL. FOR THIS, THE LOGICAL-DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE-ARGUMENTATIVE METHODS, THROUGH FUNDAMENTAL AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, HAVING AS RESOURCES NATIONAL AND FOREIGN BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
934	IN TODAY'S INFORMATION SOCIETY THE CITIZEN IS EVER MORE VISIBLE TO GOVERNMENT AND TO PRIVATE COMPANIES WHILE PARADOXICALLY GOVERNMENT ITSELF BECOMES EVER MORE SECRET. THIS ASYMMETRY IS NOT CAUSED BY SECRECY IMPLYING DELIBERATE OR INTENTIONAL CONCEALMENT OF INFORMATION. RATHER, IT RESULTS FROM SYSTEMS OF SECRETS HELD BY REMOTE OR NON-VISIBLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS, HAVING BEEN PUT TOGETHER IN AN INVISIBLE MANNER. SECOND ORDER SECRECY IS ENHANCED IN THE EU BY THE COMPOSITE CHARACTER OF EU ADMINISTRATION. IN THE EU IT IS THE COURTS AND NOT THE LEGISLATURE OR THE ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE PLAYING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ADDRESSING BITS OF THE TRANSPARENCY PARADOX FOR THE CITIZEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THREE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF EU GOVERNANCE ARE EXPLORED FROM THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE: TERRORIST BLACKLISTS, INTEROPERABLE SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AND MANDATORY DATA RETENTION AND TRANSFER.
935	THIS ESSAY EXAMINES ALEKSEI NAVAL'NYI'S POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHY NAVAL'NYI IN PARTICULAR HAS BECOME THE MOST VISIBLE OPPOSITIONAL FIGURE IN RUSSIA SINCE 2011-2012. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR NAVAL'NYI'S SUCCESS LIES IN HIS POPULIST RE-ORDERING OF PUTIN'S ECLECTIC PRINCIPLES OF PEOPLE, PATRIOTISM AND THE RULE OF LAW. BY SIMPLIFYING THE POLITICAL SPACE BETWEEN 'US AND THEM' UNDER HIS ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIVISM NAVAL'NYI HAS MANAGED TO CHALLENGE THE REGIME IN ITS OWN TERMS. AT THE SAME TIME THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD STYLE SEPARATES HIM FROM RUSSIA'S OTHER POLITICAL FIGURES WHO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE COMPELLING IDEAS FOR LARGER OPPOSITIONAL MOBILISATION. IN THIS RESPECT, REGARDING RUSSIA'S WEAK POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, ECLECTIC USAGE OF POLITICAL IDEAS AND PERSONALISTIC POLITICAL CULTURE, NAVAL'NYI APPEARS TO BE A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE.
936	ALTHOUGH THE TREND TOWARDS PLURALISATION WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE EU IS SOMEWHAT REFLECTED IN THEORETICAL EFFORTS, LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP'S ANSWER REMAINS INCOMPLETE. ACKNOWLEDGING THAT LEGAL PERSONALITY IS ALWAYS RELATIVEIE RELATED TO A PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEMPERSONALITY UNDER EU LAW SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AND DEVELOPED AS A DISTINCT CATEGORY. THIS ALLOWS FOR RECONSIDERATION AND REARRANGEMENT OF INTER- AND INTRAPERSONAL RELATIONS IN EU LAW: INTER-INSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENTS CAN GAIN FIRMER LEGAL GROUND, THE RECOGNITION OF HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES WITHIN THE EU EXECUTIVE BRANCH CAN ADVANCE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, LEGAL PROTECTION OF THE UNION'S CITIZENS SHALL BE ADVANCED, AND OPTIONS AS WELL AS LIMITS TO PRIVATISING ORGANISATION AT THE EU LEVEL SHALL BE FORMULATED. ON THE WHOLE, METHODOLOGICAL SELF-REFLECTION ALONG THESE LINES IS BOUND TO LEAD TO A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION OF LEGAL RESEARCH IN TIMES OF EU CRISIS.
937	I ARGUE THAT LAW IS NOT BEST CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPT. AFTER FIRST EXPLAINING THE NOTION OF ESSENTIAL CONTESTABILITY AND DISAGGREGATING LAW INTO SEVERAL RELATED CONCEPTS, I SHOW THAT THE MOST BASIC AND GENERAL CONCEPT OF LAW DOES NOT FIT WITHIN THE CRITERIA OFFERED FOR ESSENTIAL CONTESTATION. I BUTTRESS THIS CLAIM WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT ESSENTIAL CONTESTATION IS ITSELF A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX CONCEPTS AND THEREFORE SHOULD ONLY BE APPLIED WHEN IT WOULD YIELD A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF USES OF THE CONCEPT TO WHICH IT IS APPLIED. I THEN SHOW THAT, EVEN IF LAW MEETS SOME BASIC CRITERIA OF ESSENTIAL CONTESTATION, APPLYING THE APPELLATION DOES NOT HELPFULLY ILLUMINATE THE MOST GENERAL CONCEPT OF LAW AND THEREFORE IT SHOULD NOT BE USED, WHILE ALLOWING THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE USEFUL FOR THE RELATED CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
938	A WIDE RANGE OF CRITICS HAVE READ MEASURE FOR MEASURE AS THOUGH THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF EQUITY PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DRAMA. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT EQUITY, AT LEAST AS THAT CONCEPT IS UNDERSTOOD BY SUCH CRITICS, IS ABSENT FROM THE PLAY FOR AN IMPORTANT REASON: DUKE VINCENTIO'S OVERARCHING OBJECTIVE IS TO REESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN VIENNA-IN EFFECT TO REFOUND THE STATE. SUCH AN OBJECTIVE, IF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS ARE TO BE BELIEVED, REQUIRES EXTREME, EVEN SHOCKING MEASURES, IF IT IS TO BE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHED. IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE, DUKE VINCENTIO ACCOMPLISHES HIS REFOUNDING FIRST BY ANGELO'S HARSH ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW, ESPECIALLY HIS PROSECUTION OF CLAUDIO, AND THEN LATER BY HIS SEVERAL PARDONS (WHICH ARE ROOTED IN MERCY RATHER THAN EQUITY), PARTICULARLY HIS INEXPLICABLE PARDON OF THE UNREPENTANT MURDERER BARNARDINE.
939	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE ROLE OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND INFORMAL NETWORKS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. THE EXISTING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE LITERATURE HAS MOSTLY EXAMINED THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE EFFECT OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. OUR CONTRIBUTION IS TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF INFORMAL 'SMALL WORLD' CHARACTERISTICS OF OWNERSHIP AND BOARD NETWORKS. WE USE THE CASE OF SCANDINAVIA (DENMARK, NORWAY AND SWEDEN) TO EXAMINE THESE EFFECTS. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL LARGE DIFFERENCES IN FORMAL BOARD AND OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES BETWEEN THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES, BUT STRONG SIMILARITIES IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AS WELL AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE FIND THAT ALL THREE COUNTRIES CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS 'SMALL WORLDS' IN WHICH TRUST, INFORMATION DIFFUSION AND REPUTATION MECHANISMS ARE ACTIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS. EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW (2008) 5, 27-40. DOI: 10.1057/EMR.2008.1
940	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DUTIES IMPOSED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATION TO FACILITATE THE REPORTING OF CHILD ABUSE. WITH A FOCUS ON MANDATORY REPORTING LEGISLATION IN FOUR COUNTRIES IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICA, THE ARTICLE FILLS A GAP IN EXISTING LITERATURE WHICH LARGELY FOCUSES ON THE "GLOBAL NORTH". THE ARTICLE ELABORATES ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF INTRODUCING MANDATORY REPORTING IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FORMAL CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO CHILD ABUSE IS CONSTRAINED AND WHERE CHILD PROTECTION LEGISLATION MAY NOT ALIGN WITH THE SOCIO-CULTURAL REALITY. THE ARTICLE POSITS THAT MANDATORY REPORTING LEGISLATION IS USEFUL IN THAT IT CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT TO END VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN. HOWEVER, SUCH LEGISLATION MAY BE TOKENISTIC AND POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW IF IT IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY STRENGTHENING OF SYSTEMS OF PROTECTION AND ADDRESSING ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL SYSTEMS.
941	THE CLARIFICATION OF REGIONAL COMPETENCES IS A LEGAL OPERATION THAT CLEARLY EXCEEDS THE LISTING OF PRINCIPLES OR NORMS WHICH DICTATE THEIR REPARTITION. IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OPTIMIZE THEIR EXERCISE SINCE THAT DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT IS CONSISTENTLY CONTINGENT UPON A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT PROMOTES THE EMERGENCE OF THE LOCAL DECISION. THE TERMS AND MEANS INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION-MAKING DIVULGE THE EXTENT OF FREEDOM THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES POSSESS. IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE REGIONAL PREEMINENCE ESTABLISHED IN THE MOROCCAN CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS A FORM OF CLARIFICATION WITH REGARD TO THE SCALE OF COMPETENCES CONFERRED TO THE REGION, THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS MUST CEDE CONTROL TO THE LOCAL COLLECTIVITY OVER ITS OWN AFFAIRS. THIS PRIORITY IS ONLY VALUABLE IF THE THEORY GOVERNING THE EXERCISE OF COMPETENCES ASSIGNED TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
942	TRUTH COMMISSIONS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY VIEWED AS NECESSARY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN STATES UNDERGOING TRANSITIONS FROM AUTHORITARIAN RULE. YET, THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY AND CONTRIBUTE TO DEMOCRATIZATION RESTS, IN PART, ON THE PREEXISTENCE OF CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES IN THE STATES AND SOCIETIES THEY SERVE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THIS PARADOXICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS HAS PLAYED OUT IN THE CASE OF NEPAL. IT ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH A TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION WAS INCLUDED IN NEPAL'S 2006 PEACE AGREEMENT TO FACILITATE THE COUNTRY'S REDEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS, THE IMPLICIT POLITICAL COMPROMISE ON WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED-TOGETHER WITH A PROBLEMATIC LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, LACK OF COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS, AND WEAK RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW-HAS MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TRC TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION TO TRUTH, JUSTICE, OR DEMOCRACY.
943	BEGINNING IN THE 1980S, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ACTORS ACROSS LATIN AMERICA TURNED TO COURTS IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS TO CONTEST ECONOMIC POLICIES. VERY DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF HIGH COURT-ELECTED BRANCH INTERACTION OVER ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE EMERGED ACROSS THE REGION, WITH CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. BUILDING ON BOTH INSTITUTIONAL AND STRATEGIC ACCOUNTS OF JUDICIAL POLITICS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT HIGH COURT CHARACTER, A RELATIVELY STABLE CONGERIES OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES, CHANNELS INTERBRANCH STRUGGLES INTO PERSISTENT PATTERNS. TWO CASE STUDIES ILLUSTRATE THE ARGUMENT. IN ARGENTINA, THE HIGH COURT'S POLITICAL CHARACTER ENCOURAGED A PATTERN OF COURT SUBMISSION TO ELECTED LEADERS MARKED BY PERIODIC BOUTS OF INTERBRANCH CONFRONTATION OVER ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. IN BRAZIL, THE HIGH COURT'S STATESMANLIKE CHARACTER INDUCED INTERBRANCH ACCOMMODATION. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT EVEN IN POLITICALLY UNSTABLE SETTINGS, INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES CAN SHAPE LAW AND POLITICS.
944	THE THEORY OF FISCAL FEDERALISM ASSERTS THAT FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION INCREASES GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REDUCES GOVERNMENT BUDGETS, AND REDUCES CORRUPTION WHEN USED AS A MEANS OF GOVERNMENT REFORM. HOWEVER, COUNTER-ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE THAT SUCH AN APPROACH HAS DIVERGING EFFECTS ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE ATTEMPTED HEREIN TO CARRY OUT AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THESE THEORIES. DATA FROM 17 DEVELOPED AND 17 DEVELOPING STATES WERE OBTAINED IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS INDICATORS. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION REDUCED GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS WERE THE QUALITY OF REGULATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR EXPENDITURE AND REVENUE WERE DEVOLVED, BUDGETS EXPANDED IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION DETERRED CORRUPTION IN ADVANCED STATES, WHEREAS GREATER AUTONOMY IN SPENDING INCREASED MALFEASANCE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
945	WHAT DO COUNTRIES DO WHEN THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO A TREATY, BUT THEN FIND THAT COMMITMENT CHALLENGED? AFTER THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, THE UNITED STATES TRIED TO GET COUNTRIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE PARTIES TO THE COURT OR NOT, TO SIGN AGREEMENTS NOT TO SURRENDER AMERICANS TO THE COURT. WHY DID SOME STATES SIGN AND OTHERS NOT? GIVEN UNITED STATES POWER AND THREATS OF MILITARY SANCTIONS, SOME STATES DID SIGN. HOWEVER, SUCH FACTORS TELL ONLY PART OF THE STORY. WHEN REFUSING TO SIGN, MANY STATES EMPHASIZED THE MORAL VALUE OF THE COURT. FURTHER, STATES WITH A HIGH DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THEIR COMMITMENT. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE ADVANCES TWO CLASSIC ARGUMENTS THAT TYPICALLY ARE DIFFICULT TO SUBSTANTIATE; NAMELY, STATE PREFERENCES ARE INDEED PARTLY NORMATIVE, AND INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS DO NOT JUST SCREEN STATES; THEY ALSO CONSTRAIN.
946	CYBERATTACKS ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS ARE BECOMING A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. SABOTAGE AND DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES MAY CAUSE DEVASTATING IMPACTS ON PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, ECONOMIC SECURITY, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND SAFETY. THE WATER SECTOR IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES, AND AS SUCH, IDENTIFYING AND MANAGING CYBER THREATS ON THE WATER SECTOR'S FACILITIES IS CRUCIAL TO PROVIDING A CONTINUOUS AND SAFE SUPPLY OF WATER. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS CONDUCTED IN THE FORM OF AN ACTIVE WORKSHOP THAT AIMS TO SHOW DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER'S PERSPECTIVE ON CYBER THREATS, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, AND BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTATIONS OF CYBERSECURITY PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WATER SECTOR. THE WORKSHOP, DEMONSTRATED ON THE ISRAELI WATER AND CYBER SECTORS, BROUGHT TOGETHER 45 PROFESSIONALS FROM THE WATER AND CYBER SECTORS (GOVERNMENT, ACADEMIA, UTILITIES, CONSULTANTS, AND COMMERCIAL SUPPLIERS). IN THE CYBERSECURITY DOMAIN, MANY STUDIES FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ALGORITHMS, BUT ONLY A FEW CONSIDERED THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND POLICY ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM. THE PRESENT STUDY ADDRESSES THIS GAP AND PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INTO DECISION MAKING IN THE WATER DOMAIN. THE WORKSHOP'S FINDINGS ARE SUMMARIZED AND ANALYZED TO HIGHLIGHT TOP PRIORITY ACTIVITY AREAS AND SUGGEST REQUIRED ACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS' PERSPECTIVE, WHICH CAN HELP SHAPE THE LANDSCAPE OF THE WATER SECTOR'S CYBERSECURITY.
947	WHY IS VOTE BUYING EFFECTIVE EVEN WHERE BALLOT SECRECY IS PROTECTED? MOST ANSWERS EMERGE FROM MODELS OF MACHINE POLITICS, IN WHICH A MACHINE HOLDS RECIPIENTS OF HANDOUTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR SUBSEQUENT POLITICAL BEHAVIOR. YET VOTE BUYING IS COMMON IN MANY CONTEXTS WHERE POLITICAL PARTY MACHINES ARE NOT PRESENT, OR WHERE PARTIES EXERT LITTLE EFFORT IN MONITORING VOTERS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS PUZZLE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT POLITICIANS OFTEN DISTRIBUTE ELECTORAL HANDOUTS TO CONVEY INFORMATION TO VOTERS. THIS VOTE BUYING CONVEYS INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE FUTURE PROVISION OF RESOURCES TO THE POOR. THE AUTHOR TESTS THE ARGUMENT WITH ORIGINAL QUALITATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTED IN KENYA. A VOTER'S INFORMATION ABOUT A CANDIDATE'S VOTE BUYING LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ELECTORAL SUPPORT, AN EFFECT DRIVEN BY EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE PROVISION OF CLIENTELIST BENEFITS BEYOND THE ELECTORAL PERIOD. THE RESULTS, SHOWING THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL BENEFITS CAN BE ELECTORALLY EFFECTIVE FOR PERSUASIVE REASONS, THEREBY EXPLAIN HOW VOTE BUYING CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN THE ABSENCE OF MACHINE POLITICS.
948	THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY FACES A DILEMMA IN LOCAL COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE, I.E. STATE INTERVENTION VS. COMMUNITY SELF-GOVERNANCE. INCREASED INTERVENTION VIOLATES ITS LONG-PROMOTED SOCIAL SELF-GOVERNANCE AND UNDERMINES THE REGIMES' CREDIBILITY AND LEGITIMACY, WHILE LESS INTERVENTION MAY ADD TO THE RISK OF SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND COLLECTIVE ACTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THEREFORE, SELECTIVE INTERVENTION IS APPLIED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A RATIONAL CHOICE IN COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE POLITICAL RATIONALE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' SELECTIVE INTERVENTION IN COMMUNITY DISPUTES IN URBAN CHINA. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY, THE DEGREE OF HOMEOWNERS' SOLIDARITY AND THE MEDIA EXPOSURE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD AND DEGREE OF A LOCAL STATE'S INTERVENTION AS WELL AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
949	HUMAN DIGNITY ARISES FROM THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT PEOPLE ENJOY AS MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN COMMUNITY. THE LAW DECREES THAT HUMAN DIGNITY DOES NOT INVOLVE APPROBATION OF SOMEONE'S EXTERNAL QUALITIES; RATHER, IT IS THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF EQUAL STATUS. HUMAN DIGNITY IS NOT DETERMINED BY POSITIVE LAW, BUT IS ABOVE POSITIVE LAW, BELONGING TO THE CATEGORY OF PREEXISTENT NORMS THAT EXIST INDEPENDENT OF POSITIVE LAW. SUCH NORMS FORM THE BASIS FOR INTEGRATING LEGAL SYSTEMS. THESE PERMANENT NORMS CANNOT BE AMENDED AT WILL; THEY REPRESENT THE GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF MODERN LAW. HUMAN DIGNITY IS NOT A MATTER OF RIGHTS OR BASIC RIGHTS; RATHER, IT REPRESENTS ONE'S POSITION IN SOCIETY AND EQUAL LEGAL STATUS BEFORE THE LAW. MANY NORMATIVE LAWS IN CHINA DIRECTLY DEFINE HUMANITY DIGNITY, AND AFFIRM THE GUARANTEEING OF HUMAN DIGNITY AS THE PRIMARY TASK OF THE STATE. HUMAN DIGNITY IS RELATED TO PEOPLE'S SURVIVAL AND LIVELIHOOD; THUS A MATERIAL FOUNDATION FOR THE REALIZATION OF DIGNITY CAN BE PROVIDED BY PROVIDING MATERIAL ASSISTANCE AND IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICES.
950	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WEAK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCREASE LEVELS OF TAXATION BY "BORROWING" INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FROM CERTAIN TYPES OF BUSINESSES. WHILE MANY BUSINESSES LOBBY AGAINST TAXATION, BUSINESSES THAT ARE LOCALLY OWNED, NATIONALLY CONNECTED, AND LOGISTICALLY COMPLEX BUILD ROBUST ASSOCIATIONS THAT SUPPORT TAXATION. THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE, SO THEY EMPOWER THEIR ASSOCIATIONS TO MONITOR MEMBERS' TAX COMPLIANCE AND TO PRESSURE OFFICIALS TO UPHOLD THEIR SPENDING COMMITMENTS. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE NECESSITY OF BUSINESS SUPPORT FOR TAXATION IN THE ABSENCE OF STATE CAPACITY BY COMPARING TWO PHILIPPINE CITIES THAT DIFFER IN THEIR ABILITY TO TAX DESPITE A NUMBER OF SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THEM. THE CASE STUDIES SHOW THAT TAX INCREASES CO-VARIED WITH BUSINESS SUPPORT, AND THAT BUSINESS SUPPORT WAXED AND WANED DEPENDING ON OVER-TIME VARIATION IN THE CAPABILITY OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS TO DISCOURAGE TAX EVASION AND TO ENFORCE OFFICIAL COMMITMENTS TO SPEND ON INFRASTRUCTURE.
951	ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IS A GLOBAL PRIORITY. FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES MARKETS HAVE BECOME ESSENTIAL FOR COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ECOLOGICAL DEGRADATION. THIS STUDY LOOKS AT HOW MARKETS FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION AFFECTED ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN OECD NATIONS BETWEEN 1995 AND 2021. IT EXAMINES HOW FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION (REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE) RELATES TO ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS LIKE CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT. THE STUDY ALSO EXAMINES HOW EXPORTS AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE MEDIATE IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE MARKETS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS(STIRPAT) IS CARRIED OUT WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR INSTITUTIONAL AND ECONOMIC VARIABLES. ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS, MORE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE DECENTRALIZATION RESULTS IN LOWER CO2 EMISSIONS AND AN ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT, IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. FURTHERMORE, A HEALTHY MARKET FOR NATURAL RESOURCES STRENGTHENS THIS CONNECTION. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HOW FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION AND EFFICIENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ARE CRUCIAL FOR FOSTERING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN OECD NATIONS.
952	THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS EMBRACE THE IDEAL THAT JUDGES ARE COMMITTED TO RULEOF-LAW NORMS, COLLEGIALITY, AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. WHATEVER ELSE DIVIDES THEM, THESE JUDGES GENERALLY AGREE THAT PARTISAN IDENTITY HAS NO PLACE ON THE BENCH. CONSEQUENTLY, WHEN A COURT OF APPEALS SITS "EN BANC," (I.E., COLLECTIVELY) THE PARTY AFFILIATIONS OF THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL UNDER REVIEW SHOULD NOT MATTER. STARTING IN THE 1980S, HOWEVER, PARTISAN IDEOLOGY HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN THE SELECTION OF FEDERAL APPELLATE JUDGES. IT THUS STANDS TO REASON-AND SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE MODERN EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE-THAT TODAY'S EN BANC REVIEW COULD BE USED AS A WEAPON BY WHATEVER PARTY HAS APPOINTED THE MOST JUDGES ON ANY PARTICULAR CIRCUIT. A WEAPONIZED EN BANC REFLECTS MORE THAN JUST IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JUDGES. WE DEFINE THE PHRASE TO CAPTURE A "TEAM MENTALITY" ON THE COURTS OF APPEALS- AN US VERSUS THEM-WHERE THE JUDGES VOTE IN BLOCS ALIGNED WITH THE PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT WHO APPOINTED THEM AND USE EN BANC REVIEW TO REVERSE PANELS COMPOSED OF MEMBERS FROM THE OTHER TEAM. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TEST WHETHER EN BANC REVIEW IS NOW OR HAS EVER BEEN WEAPONIZED. WE MAKE USE OF AN ORIGINAL DATA SET-THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ONE OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE-THAT TRACKS EN BANC DECISIONS OVER SIX DECADES. OUR FINDINGS ARE SURPRISING IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT WAYS. THE BULK OF OUR DATA INDICATES THAT RULE-OF-LAW NORMS ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED. FROM THE 1960S THROUGH 2017, EN BANC REVIEW SEEMS TO HAVE DEVELOPED SOME SORT OF IMMUNITY FROM PARTISAN BEHAVIOR OVER TIME, AND WE UNPACK POTENTIAL REASONS WHY. BUT THAT IMPORTANT AND LONG-LASTING IMMUNITY COULD NOW BE IN DANGER. OUR DATA FROM 2018-2020 SHOW A DRAMATIC AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SURGE IN BEHAVIOR CONSISTENT WITH THE WEAPONIZING OF EN BANC REVIEW. IT IS TOO SOON TO TELL WHETHER THIS IS A TEMPORARY CHANGE OR AN INFLECTION POINT INDICATING A MORE PERMANENT SHIFT. WE CONSIDER BOTH POSSIBILITIES AND, IN SO DOING, HIGHLIGHT THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT EN BANC REVIEW PLAYS IN ASCERTAINING JUDICIAL COMMITMENT TO RULE-OF-LAW NORMS. THE TIME MAY SOON BE UPON US TO CONFRONT THE COST OF EN BANC REVIEW IN A REGIME WHERE PARTY IDENTITY FREQUENTLY TRUMPS OTHER JUDICIAL IMPULSES.
953	PURPOSE AS THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD DEBATES AND IN SOME CASES REPLACES PHYSICAL VOTING WITH POSTAL BALLOTS AND ON-LINE VOTING, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFRAIN FROM ADVOCATING A GENERIC APPROACH TO THE ISSUE AND IN PARTICULAR TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER ARGUES THAT UNCONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FIT FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NON-PHYSICAL (POSTAL BALLOT AND ON-LINE) VOTING METHODS, WHICH RATHER THAN BROADENING THE SCOPE OF DEMOCRACY MAY IN ACTUAL FACT BE DERAILING IT. THE KEY REASON FOR THIS DISTINCTION IS THE LACK OF POLITICAL CONSENSUS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL RULES, THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PERSISTENCE OF PAROCHIAL AND SUBJECT-BASED POLITICAL CULTURES IN MANY COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, INCLUDING POLAND. FINDINGS REPLACING PHYSICAL VOTING WITH POSTAL BALLOT, ATTEMPTED DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE SUMMER 2020 IN POLAND, EVENTUALLY FAILED AND WAS REPLACED WITH CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL VOTE. HOWEVER, THE POLISH CASE DEMONSTRATES THAT IN THE SYSTEM WITH WEAK CHECKS AND BALANCES, POSTAL BALLOT COULD BE USED TO CONSOLIDATE ILLIBERALISM NOT DEMOCRACY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT FURTHER RESEARCH ON DEFINING CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY IS NEEDED. IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A NEED TO FACTOR IN THE RESEARCH ON POLITICAL CULTURE INTO THE DEFINITIONS OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS EU MEMBERSHIP FOR POLAND AND SOME OTHER CENTRAL EUROPEAN STATES - SUCH AS HUNGARY - FAILED TO PROMPT THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. IN FACT THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED AS THE IMPACT OF EU CONDITIONALITY LOST RELEVANCE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ANY CHANGE OF ELECTORAL LAW IN POLAND AND OTHER RULE OF LAW VIOLATORS IN THE REGION IS VIEWED WITH GREAT CARE AND SCRUTINY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER'S CONCEPTUAL APPROACH RESTS ON THE DEFINITION OF CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY AS PUT FORWARD BY PRZEWORSKI (1991) AND DEVELOPED BY LINZ AND STEPAN (1996). ACCORDING TO THESE DEFINITIONS, POLAND IS NOT YET A CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY AND AS ARGUED IN THE PAPER, IT HAS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED AN EXPANSION OF ILLIBERALISM IN RECENT YEARS. THE PAPER ALSO POSITS THAT THE CONCEPT OF "CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY" SHOULD BE AUGMENTED TO INCLUDE THE EXISTENCE OF CIVIC POLITICAL CULTURE AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY.
954	ONE PECULIAR FEATURE OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE EXISTENCE OF "WEIQUAN" OR RIGHTS PROTECTION LAWYERS. THIS SMALL, INFORMAL MOVEMENT COMPRISED OF LAWYERS, ACADEMICS, AND ACTIVISTS EMERGED IN THE EARLY TWENTYFIRST CENTURY ALONGSIDE LEGAL REFORMS THAT SOUGHT TO INCREASE THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IN GENERAL, THESE LAWYERS WORK ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS CASES AND OFTEN MAKE RIGHTS-BASED CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. IN THE SUMMER OF 2015, THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY ("CCP') DETAINED OVER 200 OF THESE RIGHTS PROTECTION LAWYERS, A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION THAT MANY OBSERVERS VIEWED AS A RETREAT FROM PRIOR COMMITMENTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NOTE USES TWO THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY AND BEHAVIORAL LAW & ECONOMICS IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CCP, AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, WOULD ALLOW THIS MOVEMENT TO DEVELOP IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND WHY, AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE, THE CCP REVERSED COURSE. THE HUMAN RIGHTS LITERATURE HAS GENERALLY ASSUMED A RATIONAL CHOICE FRAMEWORK WHEN ANALYZING A STATE'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS. THE MAJOR PRINCIPLE OF RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY IS THAT AN ACTOR WILL PURSUE ACTIVITIES THAT SHE EXPECTS WILL MAXIMIZE HER UTILITY. SOME RECENT SCHOLARSHIP HAS USED SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH, TO CALL THIS PRINCIPLE INTO QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. EVEN THOUGH MUCH OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE TREATS THESE TWO FRAMEWORKS AS COMPETITORS, THIS NOTE EXPLORES HOW BOTH RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH OFFER INSIGHTS INTO DISTINCT ASPECTS OF A STATE'S DECISION TO DEVIATE FROM HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS. AFTER OUTLINING THESE TWO FRAMEWORKS IN PART I, PART II PROVIDES BACKGROUND ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE CCP'S DECISION TO DETAIN CHINA'S RIGHTS-PROTECTION LAWYERS. PART III UTILIZES BOTH RATIONAL CHOICE AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CCP TOLERATED THE EMERGENCE OF RIGHTS-PROTECTION LAWYERS AND WHY IT SEEMINGLY REVERTED TO THE EXPECTED AUTHORITARIAN POSITION BY CRACKING DOWN ON THESE LAWYERS. THIS NOTE THEN CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE DISTINCT BUT COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES THAT RATIONAL CHOICE AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH SUGGEST COULD IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS.
955	ON THE ONE HAND, POLITICAL CORRUPTION HAS VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ECONOMY AND DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRIES AND SOCIETIES. PERCEIVED CORRUPTION IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LESS SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY, LESS SATISFACTION WITH GOVERNMENT, MORE OF A SENSE THAT BREAKING RULES IS JUSTIFIABLE, LESS INSTITUTIONAL TRUST, LESS INTERPERSONAL TRUST, AND LESS INTEREST IN POLITICS. ON THE OTHER HAND, ORGANIZED CRIME HAS A PERNICIOUS IMPACT ON GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ORGANIZED CRIME AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION GO TOGETHER BECAUSE MAFIA TYPE ACTIVITIES TEND TO ERODE THE INTEGRITY OF THOSE HOLDING A PUBLIC OFFICE, INCLUDING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. WHERE ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS ARE POWERFUL, LEGISLATION, POLICY-MAKING AND LEGAL RULINGS NO LONGER SERVE THE GENERAL INTEREST BUT THE INTERESTS OF THE FEW. THESE DARK NETWORKS ARE VERY DANGEROUS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CAN PRODUCE FAILED STATES. TOLERATING ORGANIZED CRIME IMPLIES LETTING GRAND CORRUPTION PENETRATE INTO GOVERNMENT AND DESTROY THE BEDROCK OF THE STATE. THE RESEARCH QUESTION OF THIS ARTICLE IS: IS IT POSSIBLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE ORGANIZED CRIME WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL AND MERITOCRATIC BUREAUCRACY? THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A MERITOCRATIC STATE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST DARK NETWORKS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT STUDIES, WELL PERFORMING POLICE SERVICES AND INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL JUDICIARIES SEEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN CONTROLLING ORGANIZED CRIME. IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THESE STATEMENTS, IT HAS BEEN CHOSEN THE CASE OF MEXICO'S FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS. THIS WAR IS HAVING SERIOUS STRATEGIC PROBLEMS AND RISKS A POSSIBLE FAILURE. FOLLOWING THE LINE OF DISCUSSION, THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IS THE LACK OF A BUREAUCRATIC POLICE SYSTEM. IT HAS BEEN STUDIED THE HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT OF THE MEXICAN POLICE AND IT HAS BEEN FOUND VERY SERIOUS BREAKDOWN IN THE SYSTEM. BUILDING ON THIS RESEARCH AND PREVIOUS SCHOLARLY STUDIES OF STATE FORMATION PROCESSES, THE BASIC PROPOSITION OF THIS PAPER IS THAT A BUREAUCRATIC INFRASTRUCTURE AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES. MEXICO'S FIGHT AGAINST DRUGS SHOWS US HOW IMPORTANT IS HAVING A MERITOCRATIC AND PROFESSIONAL POLICE WHEN CONFRONTING ORGANIZED CRIME.
956	CONSTITUTIONALIZATON OF LAW'S DIFFERENT AREAS IS A PHENOMENON GRADUALLY MORE INGRAINED IN OUR CULTURAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK. MAYBE THE BEST DEMONSTRATION IS THE INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (TC) - CONSTITUTION'S SUPREME INTERPRETER - IN DEFINING AND REDEFINING CONCEPTS, RIGHTS AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES TOUCHING A RANGE OF SUBJECTS, FROM TAX LAW TO HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS IS RELEVANT TO UNDERSTAND THE LAW AND ITS CURRENT EFFECTS WHETHER IT IS VALUED POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY.
957	THE AIM OF THE PAPER WAS ANALYSING OF THE MAIN INDICATORS WHICH INFLUENCE ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECURITY. THE AUTHORS ALLOCATED THE MAIN APPROACHES TO DEFINE ECONOMIC SECURITY. TRADITIONALLY THE ECONOMIC SECURITY WAS ANALYSED AS A RANGE OF ECONOMIC PARAMETERS WHICH ARE NOT CONSIDERING THE INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKETING PARAMETERS. THE AUTHORS HIGHLIGHTED, THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMBINATIONS OF MARKETING, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS COULD INFLUENCE ON THE LEVEL OF THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY LEVEL WITH DIFFERENT POWER. ON THIS BASIS, THE KEY FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCED ON THE LEVEL OF THE ECONOMIC SECURITY WERE IDENTIFIED. ALL INDICATORS WERE COMBINED IN THREE GROUPS: MARKETING, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL. TO THE POLITICAL INDICATORS, THE PARAMETERS AS FOLLOWS WERE INCLUDED: VIOLENCE/TERRORISM; VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY RATING; RULE OF LAW; CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE MARKETING GROUP OF INDICATORS CONTAINED THE PARAMETER - THE COUNTRY'S BRAND. THE INSTITUTIONAL GROUP INVOLVED: ADJUSTED NET NATIONAL INCOME PER CAPITA; AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS EXPORTS; AGRICULTURE, VALUE-ADDED; EXTERNAL BALANCE ON GOODS AND SERVICES; FOOD EXPORTS; FOOD IMPORTS; FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, NETT INFLOWS; GDP GROWTH; WAGE AND SALARIED WORKERS, TOTAL; GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH; INDUSTRY, VALUE-ADDED; TOTAL NATURAL RESOURCES RENTS; TRADE. THUS, IN THE PAPER, THE AUTHORS CHECKED THE HYPOTHESIS AS FOLLOWS: THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARKETING, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PARAMETERS AND LEVEL OF ECONOMIC SECURITY. THE INFORMATIONAL BASIS FOR ANALYSES WAS DATASET FROM THE: WORLD GOVERNMENT INDICATORS, FUTURE BRAND, WORLD DATA BANK. FOR CHECKING HYPOTHESIS, THE 2SLS METHOD WAS CHOSEN. THE ANALYSED PERIOD 2002-2018 YEARS. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS PROVED THAT POLITICAL STABILITY HAD A NEGATIVE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AT LEVEL 1% ON AGRICULTURE VALUE-ADDED, AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS EXPORTS, FOOD IMPORTS. BESIDES, THE RULE OF LAW HAD A NEGATIVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE INDICATORS: AGRICULTURAL RAW MATERIALS EXPORTS, VALUE-ADDED, AND AGRICULTURE VALUE-ADDED. THE FINDING PROVED THAT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL IMBALANCE RESTRICTS THE RECOVERING OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECURITY. IN THIS CASE, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSIDER NOT ONLY ECONOMIC PARAMETERS BUT ALSO MARKETING AND INSTITUTIONAL DURING DEVELOPING THE MECHANISM TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SECURITY.
958	VIETNAM EXPERIENCED POLITICAL UNREST FROM ITS FOUNDING IN 1945-2000. HOWEVER, SINCE 2000, HINTS OF SYSTEM STABILITY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. POLITICAL UNREST STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATIONS OF NATIONAL CORRUPTION OVER TIME. BY CONSIDERING THE FUNCTIONS OF PER-CAPITA INCOME AND NATURAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL INSTABILITY (PIS), AND NATURAL RESOURCES ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE USED DATA FROM 1980 TO 2020 TO APPLY LINEAR AND NON-LINEAR AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (ARDL). BOTH APPROACHES SUPPORTED THE THEORY WHEN APPLIED TO VIETNAM. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT PIS HAS A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON A NATION'S GDP, WHEREAS NATURAL RESOURCES INCREASE GDP OVER THE LONG AND SHORT TERM. IN CONTRAST, CORRUPTION TEMPORARILY BOOSTS GDP, WHILE LOWERING IT OVER TIME. THE ASYMMETRIC RESULTS OVER THE LONG-TERM SHOW THAT AS CORRUPTION INCREASES, GDP DECREASES, AND AS CORRUPTION DECREASES, GDP INCREASES. THE CAUSALITY CORRELATION SUPPORTS THESE FINDINGS AND SUGGESTS POLICIES TO COMBAT LEASE AND PATRONAGE PRACTICES AND CREATE A MORE TRANSPARENT NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS WILL HELP CONTROL THE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS OF PIS, CORRUPTION, AND UNTAPPED NATURAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPERITY.
959	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIAL, LEGAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM OF RESTRICTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. CONSIDERING THE SYSTEM OF RESTRICTIONS OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MECHANISM FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENSURING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE AUTHOR DWELLS ON THE PROBLEM OF PROPORTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF THE CORRESPONDING RESTRICTIONS. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR SUCH RESTRICTIONS, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE MECHANISM OF PROTECTING RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS FROM EXCESSIVE RESTRICTIONS. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE LEGAL POSITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON THE RECOGNITION OF REGIONAL "CORONAVIRUS" RESTRICTIONS ON RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AS COMPLYING WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. SEPARATELY, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF LIMITING HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DIGITAL EVOLUTION OF SOCIETY, EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC OF THE NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION (COVID-19) ON THE ACTIVATION OF EXTRA-LEGAL ACTIVITIES OF STATE AUTHORITIES AND OFFICIALS, AS WELL AS ISSUES RELATED TO THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THIS PUBLIC-POWER ACTIVITY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE DIGITAL FORMS AND TOOLS USED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF RESTRICTIVE REGIMES WERE MAINLY IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EXTRA-LEGAL FORM OF POWER AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. THE LATTER, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, IS CAUSED NOT ONLY BY THE VERY SPECIFICS OF THE EXTREME SITUATION, BUT ALSO BY THE WEAK ELABORATION OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION REGULATING THE PROCEDURE AND MODES OF USING END-TO-END DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE POWER AND LEGAL ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE AND OFFICIALS.
960	PURPOSE THIS PAPER EVALUATES HOW INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY INFLUENCE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE SUBREGION OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). DATA FOR THE EMPIRICAL INQUIRY WERE COMPILED FROM RELEVANT SOURCES FOR 33 COUNTRIES IN THE SUBREGION FROM 2002 TO 2019. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES VERIFYING HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIPS WERE CARRIED OUT USING THE CONTINUOUS UPDATING ESTIMATOR (CUE) BY HANSEN ET AL. (1996). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATES HOW INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY INFLUENCE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE SUBREGION OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). DATA FOR THE EMPIRICAL INQUIRY WERE COMPILED FROM RELEVANT SOURCES FOR 33 COUNTRIES IN THE SUBREGION FROM 2002 TO 2019. EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES VERIFYING HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIPS WERE CARRIED OUT USING THE CONTINUOUS UPDATING ESTIMATOR (CUE) BY HANSEN ET AL. (1996). FINDINGS THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON FINANCIAL INSTITUTION EFFICIENCY, SUPPORTING THE VIEW THAT IMPROVED AND SUPPORTIVE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNANCE TEND TO PROMOTE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AMONG ECONOMIES IN SSA. IN ADDITION, IMPROVEMENT IN INDIVIDUAL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW WAS ALSO FOUND TO SUPPORT OR ENHANCE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AMONG ECONOMIES IN THE SUBREGION. MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ON THE OTHER HAND IS FOUND TO IMPEDE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; THE SAME CONDITION (MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY) IS FURTHER FOUND TO NEGATE ANY POSITIVE IMPACT CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW HAVE ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE SUBREGION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE UNLIKE MOST OF RELATED STUDIES, THIS STUDY ADOPTS A DIFFERENT APPROACH ON THE DYNAMICS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. APPROACH PURSUED IN THIS EMPIRICAL INQUIRY EXAMINES HOW THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WITHIN WHICH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OPERATE, THE FORM OF GOVERNANCE AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS INFLUENCE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AMONG EMERGING ECONOMIES IN SUB-SAHARA. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS CONDUCTED EXAMINES EFFECTS OF VARIABLES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THIS STUDY; THESE VARIABLES ARE EITHER CONSTRUCTED OR ECONOMETRICALLY DERIVED SPECIFICALLY FOR VARIOUS INTERACTIONS VERIFIED IN THE STUDY. FOR INSTANCE, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLE IS AN INDEX CONSTRUCTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS STUDY USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS APPROACH.
961	THE PRESENT ARTICLE INTENTS TO STUDY THE TENDENCIES OF THE CRIMINAL LEGISLATIONS OF SOME OCCIDENTAL COUNTRIES IN THE LAST DECADES, ATTAINING TO THE POLITICAL-CRIMINAL PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN SHOWING A PECULIAR EXPANSION OF PUNITIVISM IN THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL COUNTRIES, BY THE INCREASING OF SEVERITY OF CRIMINAL REPRESSIONS AND FLEXIBILIZATION OF THE PENAL GARANTISM. THIS STUDY HAS ITS JUSTIFICATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE IMPACTS THAT THESE LEGISLATIVE TENDENCIES ARE CAUSING ON THE PUNITIVE DISCIPLINE IN THE OCCIDENTAL STATES. IT HAS AS OBJECTIVE, IN SYNTHESIS, TO INVESTIGATE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PARADIGM OF THE CRIMINAL TOUGHNESS THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE PRESENT TIMES - NAMED AS "CRIMINAL LAW OF THE ENEMY" BY GUNTHER JAKOBS - AND ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE POSTULATES THAT BUILD THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW, IN COMPASS WITH THE IMPOSITIONS OF THE MINIMALIST CRIMINAL LAW AND OF THE PENAL GARANTISM. TO DO SO, THE PRESENT STUDY RELIES ON INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL DOCTRINES, AIMING TO PUT IN TERMS THE MAJOR PHILOSOPHICAL AND JURIDICAL BASES OF THE MINIMALIST AND GARANTISTIC MODEL, DEFENDING ITS CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. IN ADDITION, ANALYZES THE INVESTIGATED PHENOMENON OF THE PENAL EXPANSIONISM, SEEKING, ABOUT THIS LAST ONE, TO ESTABLISH ITS GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE OCCIDENTAL WORLD, FOR WHICH WE ALSO UNDERTAKE A RESEARCH OF THE PERTINENT CRIMINAL LEGISLATION OF SOME COUNTRIES TOOK AS MODELS. BY THE SHOWN, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EXPANSIONISM OF THE CRIMINAL LAW MODEL OBSERVED IN THE LAST DECADES IN THE OCCIDENT IS TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE JURIDICAL LIMITS AND GUARANTEES DISPOSED IN THE OCCIDENTAL CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH BUILD THE MODEL OF THE PENAL GARANTISM, WITH PROTECTION OF THE CITIZENS' FREEDOM AGAINST THE EXCESSES OF THE PUNITIVE POWER. INDEED, THE FLEXIBILIZATION OF THESE LIMITS AND GUARANTEES OPERATED BY THE PENAL EXPANSIONISM OR "CRIMINAL LAW OF THE ENEMY" CREATE AN STATE OF EXCEPTION AND VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE, BECAUSE THEY OVERWHELM THE JURIDICAL CONTENTIONS TO THE PUNITIVE POWER WITH THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF EMERGENCIES THAT RENEW THEMSELVES ALL THE TIME, ALLOWING THE REASON OF STATE TO PREVAIL AGAINST THE REASON OF THE LAW.
962	CANADA HAS FOUND ITSELF IN SERIOUS DIPLOMATIC DISPUTES OVER THE PAST YEAR WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND CHINA. THE SAUDIS TOOK ISSUE WITH THE CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER'S CALL TO RELEASE HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS FROM PRISON, WHEREAS CHINA WAS ANGRY AT CANADA'S ARREST OF A SENIOR CHINESE EXECUTIVE ON AN EXTRADITION REQUEST FROM THE UNITED STATES. THESE INCIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS ISOLATED ABERRATIONS. AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES SEEM INCREASINGLY EMBOLDENED TO LASH OUT AT COUNTRIES THAT DISPLEASE THEM, INCLUDING ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT OTTAWA HAS SUCCEEDED IN RALLYING CONSIDERABLE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR ITS POSITION IN THE CHINA DISPUTE, SUGGESTING THAT WHILE CANADA MAY BE EXPOSED, IT IS NOT DESTINED TO BE ALONE.
963	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF LAW IS POSSIBLE THROUGH COMPARATIVE, ANALOGICAL EXAMINATION OF LEGAL WORK AND THE ART OF JAZZ IMPROVISATION. THIS EXPLORATION ILLUMINATES A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN RULE OF LAW ASPIRATIONS EMPHASIZING STABILITY AND DETERMINATE MEANINGS AND CONTRASTING CLAIMS THAT THE UNTENABLE ALTERNATIVE IS PERVASIVE DISCRETIONARY OR POLITICIZED LAW. IN BOTH THE LAW AND JAZZ IMPROVISATION SETTINGS, THE WORK INVOLVES CONSTRAINING RULES, OTHERS' UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS, AND STRATEGIC CHOOSING WITH ATTENTION TO WHERE A COLLECTIVE CREATION IS GOING. ONE EXPECTS CHANGE AND CREATIVITY IN IMPROVISATION, BUT THE MANY ANALOGOUS CHARACTERISTICS OF LAW ILLUMINATE WHY CHANGE AND CHOICE ARE THE NORM IN LAW TOO. RARELY IS LAW JUST ABOUT FERRETING OUT SOME ISOLATED, CLEAR, BUT ABSTRUSE LEGAL COMMAND. IN JAZZ AND LEGAL SETTINGS, RELATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF STRENGTH ARE MORE COMMONLY APT THAN ARE EXPECTATIONS OF A SINGLE CORRECT ANSWER OR SIMPLE BINARY RIGHT-VERSUS-WRONG DETERMINATIONS. THERE IS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLAIMS THAT LAW SIMPLY PROVIDES DETERMINATE ANSWERS, VERSUS CLAIMS THAT LAW CONSTRAINS AND GUIDES WHAT REMAIN CHOICES. MUCH AS JAZZ IMPROVISERS MUST BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE SURROUNDING CONSTRAINED CHOICES OF OTHERS, LEGAL ANALYSIS OF CONTEXT AND CONSEQUENCES OF LEGAL CHOICES, WITH SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION TO OTHERS' ROLES AND COMPETENCE, SHOULD ALWAYS BE PART OF LEGAL ACTIONS. THIS DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT LAW'S NATURE HELPS ILLUMINATE AND CRITIQUE BOTH MAJOR METHODOLOGICAL LEGAL DIVIDES, ENDURING JURISPRUDENTIAL DEBATES, AND SEVERAL CUTTING-EDGE CASE STUDIES. THOSE CASE STUDIES INCLUDE STANDING LAW'S TRANSFORMATION, INCLUDING THE 2021 TRANSUNION STANDING DECISION, ONGOING BATTLES OVER WHAT WATERS ARE PROTECTED BY THE CLEAN WATER ACT, DEBATES OVER TEXTUALIST METHODOLOGY'S CLAIMS OF CONSTRAINT, AND INCREASING JUDICIAL RELIANCE ON THE "MAJOR QUESTIONS DOCTRINE " WITH SHIFTS AWAY FROM THE FAMILIAR DEFERENTIAL CHEVRON FRAMEWORK. IMPROVISING MUSICIANS MUST ENSURE THEIR CHOICES MUSICALLY FIT WITH GOVERNING FORMS, PRACTICES, AND OTHERS' CHOICES. SIMILARLY, THE ARTICLE CLOSES BY ILLUMINATING WHY, TO FURTHER RULE OF LAW VALUES AND CHECK POWER ABUSES, LEGAL ACTORS SHOULD ALWAYS ASSESS THE CONSEQUENTIAL CONGRUENCE OF THEIR TENABLE CHOICES WITH SURROUNDING LAW, GIVING SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT TO STATUTORY POLICIES AND LINKED EFFECTS ANALYSIS BY AGENCIES.
964	INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ('IFIS'), SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION ('IFC'), HAVE PROGRESSIVELY REFINED THEIR OWN OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS, SUCH AS THE INSPECTION PANEL AND COMPLIANCE ADVISORY OMBUDSMAN, IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL DEMANDS FOR THEIR ENHANCED ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE TWO DEVELOPMENTS ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN TRANSFORMING IFIS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THE IFC INTO LAW-MAKING AND LAW-GOVERNED INSTITUTIONS. WE ARGUE THAT THE OPERATIONAL POLICIES, AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES SURROUNDING THESE POLICIES (THAT IS, RULE-MAKING, RULE-APPLICATION AND RULE-ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES), SHOULD BE ASSESSED IN LEGAL TERMS - EVEN THOUGH THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE OPERATIONAL POLICIES ARE CONTESTED, AND THE POLICIES ARE ONLY APPLICABLE TO IFI STAFF AND THEIR BORROWERS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS IN SUPPORT OF THIS CONTENTION.
965	FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF JUDGES - 'CHILLING EFFECT' OF MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST JUDGES (AND PROSECUTORS) - SILENCE OR MODIFICATION OF SPEECH - RULE OF LAW CRISIS - 'CHILLING EFFECT' AS ONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DETERMINING THE PROPORTIONALITY OF AN INTERFERENCE WITH FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION - FLEXIBLE APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE SOURCES OF THE 'CHILLING EFFECT' - LITTLE ATTENTION DEVOTED BY THE COURT TO THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT - MEASURES MAY NOT HAVE IMMINENT REPERCUSSIONS FOR A GIVEN JUDGE, MAY BE LIGHT, AND MAY TAKE THE FORM OF A THREAT - 'CHILLING EFFECT' MAY EXTEND FROM ONE LEGAL PROFESSION TO ANOTHER - 'CHILLING EFFECT' EXPLAINS WHY THE COURT AFFORDS GREATER PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO PROMINENT JUDGES - GREATER CONSISTENCY IN THE COURT'S APPLICATION OF THE 'CHILLING EFFECT' ARGUMENT WOULD BE WELCOME - FIRST STEP OF AN AMBITIOUS RESEARCH QUEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER JUDGES FEEL FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS, OR LIVE IN A STATE OF FEARDOM.
966	AN UNFAIR DIVISION OF RESOURCES AND BIASED TREATMENT FAVORING THE RULING ELITES HAVE PERPETUATED SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE POSTCOLONIAL SOCIETIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. PAKISTAN, ONE OF THESE COUNTRIES, HAS STRUGGLED TO EMERGE FROM THE LEGACIES OF COLONIALISM. THE SITUATION DEMANDS STRONG SUPPORT OF EQUALITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW AMONG YOUTH AND ADOLESCENTS, INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS. LIBRARIES CAN PLAY A ROLE IN EXPLORING THESE ISSUES WITH STUDENTS THROUGH PLEASURE READING. PUNJAB UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, THE OLDEST AND LARGEST UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN PAKISTAN, STARTED A BOOK CLUB PROGRAM IN JANUARY 2018 TO ENCOURAGE READING AMONG ITS USERS. THE PUNJAB UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BOOK CLUB IS NOW A WELL-RECOGNIZED INTELLECTUAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY, AND OTHER PAKISTANI LIBRARIES HAVE STARTED SIMILAR BOOK GROUPS. THE ENTHUSIASTIC PARTICIPATION AND COMMENTS OF THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY SHOW THAT LIBRARIES CAN HELP BUILD A MORE JUST SOCIETY IN PAKISTAN BY SPONSORING SOCIAL READING ACTIVITIES.
967	WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF THE STATE IN ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKING? THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT FRIEDRICH HAYEK, WHO IS OFTEN CONSIDERED A PROPONENT OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE LIBERALISM, OFFERS THREE DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THIS PROBLEM. FIRST, HAYEK ARGUES THAT THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR COMPETITIVE MARKETS. SECOND, HE PROPOSES TO EMPLOY THE RULE OF LAW CRITERIA - GENERALITY, EQUALITY, AND CERTAINTY - TO DISTINGUISH PERMISSIBLE FROM NONPERMISSIBLE STATE INTERVENTIONS. THIRD, HE DOWNPLAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF DELIBERATE LEGISLATION AND MOVES CLOSER TO THE MISESIAN IDEA OF A MINIMAL STATE. THE PAPER CONSIDERS THESE ANSWERS IN LIGHT OF HAYEK'S ANALYSIS OF THE KNOWLEDGE PROBLEM. WE SUGGEST THAT A HAYEKIAN APPROACH TO ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKING SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE FRAMEWORK OF GENERAL RULES THAT GUIDE INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR, THEREBY ENABLING SPONTANEOUS ORDERING PROCESSES AND REDUCING THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL BURDEN PLACED ON POLICY-MAKERS.

968	THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RECENT CROATIAN REGULATION ON MIGRATION (LEGISLATION AND POLICY DOCUMENTS) IS GROUNDED ON EVIDENCE AND BUILDS ON EMPIRICAL DATA DRAWN FROM THE PROCESSES AND DRAFT LEGISLATION, PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS, IMPACT ASSESSMENT, PARLIAMENTARY DISCUSSIONS, PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND EVALUATION REPORTS. IN THIS WAY, THE PAPER ALSO PROVIDES A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MIGRATION REGULATION, FROM AGENDA-SETTING TO THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION. RESEARCH HAS ENABLED US TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITIES TO IMPROVE MIGRATION LAW-MAKING BY MEANS OF EVIDENCE-BASED LAW-MAKING TECHNIQUES AND OTHER BETTER REGULATION INSTRUMENTS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE USE OF BETTER REGULATION INSTRUMENTS IN DEVELOPING MIGRATION REGULATION MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AS WELL AS TO THE REDUCTION OF ARBITRARY USE OF POWER BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AND THUS FOSTER THE STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
969	GUATEMALA HAS BEEN STRUGGLING IN ITS ROAD TOWARDS CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY SINCE THE MID-80S WHEN ITS FIRST DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED. INTERNAL CONFLICT IS NO RARE OCCURRENCE IN A COUNTRY WHICH CIVIL WAR ENDED RELATIVELY RECENTLY, IN 1996, AND LASTED OVER 30 YEARS. TODAY, WHILE GUATEMALA'S ECONOMY IS THE LARGEST OF CENTRAL AMERICA, INEQUALITY, POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION - PARTICULARLY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, ARE RIFE. ORGANIZED CRIME IS ALSO A PREVALENT CONCERN AND AN IMMINENT THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE EVIDENCED HOW PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES ARE COMPROMISED BY A ROTTEN POLITICAL FINANCE SYSTEM WITH PERVASIVE LINKS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING STRUCTURES. THIS PAPER (1) ANALYZES THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK (AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION) FOR POLITICAL FINANCING IN GUATEMALA; (2) IDENTIFIES HOW ORGANIZED CRIME USES THOSE GAPS TO FILTER DIRTY MONEY IN POLITICS, AND, MORE GENERALLY, IN PUBLIC LIFE; AND (3) PINPOINTS PRIORITY AREAS FOR SUSTAINABLE REFORM.
970	EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC UNDOUBTEDLY MEETS THIS CRITERION, REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY SOLUTIONS TO BE ADOPTED, EXTENDING TO THE STATE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS TO PREVENT SUCH CRISES FROM ESCALATING. FOR THIS REASON, THE INTRODUCTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HOLDING A REMOTE SESSION OF THE SEJM SEEMED A REASONABLE MOVE FROM AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, BUT IN PRACTICE, IT PROVED TO BE A GREAT CHALLENGE, NOT ONLY FROM AN ORGANISATIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ENSURING RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SHOW HOW THE CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY HAS INSTRUMENTALLY PLAYED ON THE PARLIAMENT AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS UNDER THE GUISE OF FIGHTING AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO GAIN MAKESHIFT POLITICAL BENEFITS, WITHOUT ANY REGARD FOR THE STANDARDS OF LAW-MAKING IN A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW STATE.
971	WHEN PEOPLE EVALUATE HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS IN PRACTICE, THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE OUTCOMES OF THE REGIME'S PERFORMANCE IS AN INFLUENTIAL SOURCE OF SATISFACTION. NONETHELESS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE REGIME'S PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES IS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF CITIZEN'S APPROVAL AS WELL. TO TEST THIS CLAIM, THIS STUDY ANALYSES MEXICO, A NATION THAT HAS ACHIEVED A PROMINENT PLACE AMONG THOSE LATIN AMERICA'S COUNTRIES WHERE A VAST MAJORITY OF ITS CITIZENS IS DISSATISFIED WITH DEMOCRACY. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT POLITICAL DISSATISFACTION IN MEXICO IS ONLY EXPLAINED IN PART BY PEOPLE'S DISAPPROVING EVALUATIONS OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SITUATION OR THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICES. A MORE COMPLETE AND COHERENT PICTURE EMERGES IF THE ANALYSIS ACCOUNTS FOR CITIZEN'S EVALUATIONS OF THE POLITICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INCUMBENT GOVERNMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES.
972	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PLACE OF MACHIAVELLI'S PRINCE IN THE HISTORY OF ETHICS AND THE HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY. CLOSE SCRUTINY INDICATES THAT MACHIAVELLI ADVANCES AN ETHICAL SYSTEM FOR LEADERSHIP THAT INVOLVES UPROOTING CORRUPTION AND ESTABLISHING RULE OF LAW. HE DRAWS ON HISTORY AND CURRENT AFFAIRS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A REALISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT FORMS A BASIS FOR A CONSEQUENTIALIST ETHICS. WHILE HE CLAIMS A GOOD LEADER MIGHT DO BAD THINGS, THIS IS IN SITUATIONS WHERE NECESSITY CONSTRAINS A PRINCE TO CHOOSING THE LEAST BAD COURSE OF ACTION. FURTHERMORE, MACHIAVELLI ADVOCATES WINNING THE GOODWILL OF FOLLOWERS THROUGH LEADERSHIP AS A SOURCE OF POWER. MACHIAVELLI'S LEADERSHIP ETHICS HAS A SOPHISTICATION NOT FULLY ENJOYED BY HIS REPUTATION IN MANAGEMENT SCHOLARSHIP. HE WOULD NOT SCORE AS ESPECIALLY MACHIAVELLIAN ON THE MACH IV. MANY OF HIS IDEAS CONTAIN SEEDS FOR THEORIES THAT ARE NOW CONSIDERED IMPORTANT FOR LEADERSHIP TODAY.
973	IN INSTANCES OF WIDESPREAD CONFLICT AND MASS ATROCITIES, SOCIALLY PRESCRIBED AND PERPETUATED GENDER ROLES OFTEN BEGIN TO DISSOLVE ALONGSIDE THE RULE OF LAW AND STATE INSTITUTIONS. MASS VIOLENCE TEARS AT THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY AND ACCEPTED NORMS OF GENDERED BEHAVIOR ARE SUSPENDED. RECENT CONFLICTS, INCLUDING THE GENOCIDE IN RWANDA, HAVE CREATED A TEMPORARY SPACE FOR THE INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN PREVIOUSLY RESTRICTED PUBLIC SPHERES AND CAPACITIES. RWANDA STANDS OUT AS UNIQUE BECAUSE THESE CHANGES WERE NOT TEMPORARY. FOLLOWING THE END OF THE GENOCIDE, RWANDA'S STATE ORGANS, NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS DID NOT CLOSE OFF THESE PUBLIC SPACES OR ADVOCATE FOR THE RETURN OF GIRLS AND WOMEN TO PRE-GENOCIDE GENDER STRUCTURES AND PATRIARCHAL PRACTICES. THIS PAPER WILL ANALYZE RWANDA'S GENDER MAINSTREAMING AND GENDER EQUALITY INITIATIVES, IDENTIFYING THREE INFLUENTIAL FACTORS, AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE REPLICATION OF RWANDA'S SUCCESS IN OTHER POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES.
974	JOINT VENTURES ARE COMMON IN JORDAN, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. LOCAL FIRMS AND FOREIGN ENTREPRENEURS USE THEM FOR DIFFERENT LEGAL AND COMPETITION CONSIDERATIONS. HOWEVER, JOINT VENTURES ARE NOT REGULATED AS SUCH, HENCE THEIR DISPUTABLE LEGAL CHARACTERISATION. JORDANIAN COURTS TREAT COMMERCIAL JOINT VENTURES AS VALID COMPANIES WITH JURIDICAL PERSONALITIES REGARDLESS OF INCORPORATION FORMALITIES. COURTS APPARENTLY TAKE THIS AS A RULE OF LAW. RELEVANT CASES REVEAL INCONSISTENCY AND ARE NOT WHOLLY CONSONANT WITH THE LAW. WHILE JUDICIAL CREATIVITY MAY BE CLASSIFYING JOINT VENTURES AS COMPANIES SUI GENERIS, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ESTABLISH THAT THIS IS INCORRECT. THE NATURE OF A JOINT VENTURE SHOULD REST ON THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT, WHICH MAY ENVISAGE A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP, A SILENT COMPANY, OR ANOTHER SCHEME. EXISTING LEGISLATIONS ARE SATISFACTORY AS THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS. ACCORDINGLY, THE JUDICIAL APPROACH SHOULD BE ABANDONED TO AVOID CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES AND TO ATTAIN PREDICTABILITY OF CONSISTENT LEGAL SOLUTIONS.
975	THIS PAPER, WRITTEN TO MARK THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FACULTY OF PUBLIC HEALTH, REFLECTS ON THE CHALLENGES TO GOVERNANCE IN A UNITED KINGDOM OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION. DRAWING ON VIRCHOW'S CALL TO ADDRESS THE POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, IT DESCRIBES A SITUATION IN WHICH THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CONSISTENTLY DISPLAYS DISREGARD FOR THE INSTITUTIONS OF STATE, AND THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED, SUCH AS HONESTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT ARGUES THAT THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE PAST AND THAT IT UNDERMINES THE TRUST THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES THAT ATTRACT PUBLIC SUPPORT. IT ENDS WITH A CHALLENGE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY WILL CHALLENGE THE DECLINE IN PUBLIC STANDARDS, AND THUS PROMOTE STRUCTURES THAT CAN CONSIDER AND PRIORITIZE HEALTH OR CONTINUE TO PICK UP THE PIECES OF POLITICAL FAILINGS.
976	THE ARTICLE REVIEWS TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL NON-BINDING STANDARDS: 1) THE EQUALISATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS RIGHTS-HOLDERS; 2) THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF THE SAFEGUARDS APPROACH IN THE CONTEXT OF REDD+; 3) THE WIDE DEFINITION OF WHO CONSTITUTES STAKEHOLDERS; AND 4) THE SCOPE OF A DUE DILIGENCE REQUIREMENT. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES TWO APPROACHES: 1) MOBILISATION, UNDERSTOOD AS POLITICAL OR LEGAL PRESSURE EXERTED UPON ENDOGENOUS ACTORS BY OTHER ENDOGENOUS ACTORS, AND WHERE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SERVE AS THE NORM BASIS FOR THIS PRESSURE. 2) CONTROL, IMPLYING THAT POWER ASYMMETRIES IN RELATION TO EXTERNAL ACTORS ARE CHALLENGED BY ALLIANCES WITH HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANISATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISATIONS. BOTH BENEFIT FROM BEING EMBEDDED IN HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES: DIGNITY, NON-DISCRIMINATION, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT. HUMAN RIGHTS MIGHT, HOWEVER, LEAD TO TENSIONS INTERNALLY, AS THESE PRINCIPLES CAN CONFLICT WITH CUSTOMARY AND EXCLUSIONARY DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES.
977	THIS STUDY SHEDS LIGHT ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INNOVATION INPUT INFLUENCES CO2 EMISSIONS AND HOW COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FACTORS MAY MODERATE THIS RELATIONSHIP. THE SAMPLE FOR THE STUDY CONSISTS OF CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA FROM 29 EMERGING COUNTRIES AND 725 COUNTRY-YEAR OBSERVATIONS. WE FIND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INNOVATION INPUT AND CO2 EMISSIONS, SUGGESTING THAT COUNTRIES THAT INVEST IN INNOVATION COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE BY REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS. BY SEPARATING THE SAMPLE INTO LOW AND HIGH INNOVATIVE COUNTRIES, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT REDUCTION OF CO2 EMISSIONS IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH INNOVATION INPUT. WE FURTHER ESTABLISH THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FACTORS, INCLUDING POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ALL NEGATIVELY MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF INNOVATION INPUT ON CO2 EMISSIONS. OUR FINDINGS SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF INNOVATION AND COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES.
978	PURPOSE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IS A STRATEGIC DECISION FOR ACHIEVING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF FDI USING DATA FROM 24 EMERGING MARKETS INCLUDING CHINA, INDIA, INDONESIA, TURKEY, THAILAND, MALAYSIA AND PAKISTAN. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT ATTRACT FDI IN EMERGING MARKETS, THIS STUDY HAS USED DATA FROM SOURCES SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK, INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND UNCTAD. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH INDICATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY, TRADE COST MEASURED BY TARIFF AND NON-TARIFF BARRIERS, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MEASURED BY EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL ON CORRUPTION ARE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF FDI IN EMERGING MARKETS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO ANALYZE THE SECTORAL INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF INWARD FDI IN THE IMPORTANT EMERGING ECONOMIES, TO THE BEST OF AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE.
979	CORPORATIONS ARE PART OF THE FABRIC OF SOCIETY. AS MEMBERS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY-OFTEN, VERY POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL ONES-CORPORATIONS HAVE A DEEP INTEREST IN THE HEALTH OF THE NATION'S DEMOCRACY, A MAINSTAY OF WHICH IS THE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE WRIT LARGE. THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE FOR ALL IS SO IMPORTANT TO THIS DEMOCRACY THAT THE FOUNDERS PLACED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION'S FIRST LINE. BUT THE SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT. ATTAINING EQUAL JUSTICE FOR ALL CITIZENS AND GOVERNING BY THE RULE OF LAW TOO OFTEN ARE MERELY ASPIRATIONS. CORPORATIONS HAVE A STAKE IN ENSURING THAT THEIR DISPUTES WITH OTHERS ARE RESOLVED FAIRLY, IN A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS VIEWED AS TREATING ALL LITIGANTS EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW, REGARDLESS OF SIZE, WEALTH, OR POWER. CORPORATE ENGAGEMENT IN STRENGTHENING LEGAL SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES IS, IN THIS WAY, AN EXPRESSION OF CORPORATE SELF-INTEREST.
980	THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE REQUIRES STATE PARTIES TO ESTABLISH AND STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND INDEPENDENT ELECTORAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PROVISIONS CAN BE INVOKED BY INDIVIDUALS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE A COURT OF LAW IS UNCERTAIN. IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER SUCH PROVISIONS GUARANTEE "STAND-ALONE" INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND AS SUCH WHETHER THE CHARTER COULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE A HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENT. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ANALYSE WHETHER THE CHARTER IS A HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS EXAMINING ITS JUSTICIABILITY IN LIGHT OF THE DECISION OF THE AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS IN APDH V COTE D'IVOIRE. THE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE COURT'S DECISION AFFIRMING THAT THE CHARTER IS A HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENT AND THAT INDIVIDUALS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS CAN FILE CASES IN A COURT OF LAW SEEKING ITS ENFORCEMENT.
981	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA TOWARDS ENSURING GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY. THE OPEN GOVERNMENT INFORMATION REGULATIONS (OGI) WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN 2007 IS A LANDMARK IN THE TRANSPARENCY REFORMS PROCESS IN CHINA. THE ANALYSIS OF THIS INITIATIVE AND FURTHER REFORMS BECOMES VITAL AS CHINA HAS WITNESSED NEWLY EMERGED EMPHASIS ON ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN AND RULE OF LAW. THOUGH THESE REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED IN 2007 AT NATIONAL LEVEL, MANY REFORMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THESE REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF ANNUAL GUIDELINES FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF OGI; THE SCOPE OF THESE REGULATIONS; THE LEGAL, POLITICAL AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS OBSTRUCTING THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REGULATIONS; AND FURTHER REFORMS TOWARDS MAKING CHINA MORE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. THIS WORK ALSO PROVIDES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION DISCLOSURE INITIATIVES IN CHINA AND INDIA.
982	MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION PREVENTS EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, INCLUDING A FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT BY A MEXICAN STATE POLICE COMMANDER, THEN SUGGESTS HOW AND WHY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY ESTABLISHING UNITED NATION (UN) INSPECTORS WHO ARE EMPOWERED TO INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN DETERRING CORRUPTION AND RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE U.S.- MEXICO BORDER REGION. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE ROME STATUTE PROVIDES A MODEL FOR ESTABLISHING THIS TYPE OF TREATY AND A PRECEDENT FOR ALL OF THE POWERS ENVISIONED FOR UN INSPECTORS, AND SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENT LEADERS MAY BE COMPELLED BY THEIR OWN CITIZENS TO SIGN AND RATIFY SUCH A TREATY IF IT IS POSED AS A PUBLIC LITMUS TEST OF THEIR LEADERS' WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.
983	USING NORTHERN IRELAND AS A CASE STUDY, THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW LAWYERS RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGES OF ENTRENCHED DISCRIMINATION, SUSTAINED POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND AN EMERGING PEACE PROCESS. DRAWING UPON THE LITERATURE OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAWYERING, IT EXAMINES WHETHER LAWYERS CAN OR SHOULD BE MORE THAN 'PAID TECHNICIANS' IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. IT FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR UPON A NUMBER OF 'CRITICAL JUNCTURES' IN THE LEGAL HISTORY OF THE JURISDICTION AND UNCOUPLES KEY ELEMENTS OF THE LOCAL LEGAL CULTURE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO AN ETHOS OF QUIETISM. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE VERSION OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALISM THAT EMERGED IN NORTHERN IRELAND WAS CONTINGENT AND SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED AND, WITH NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS, OBFUSCATED A COLLECTIVE FAILURE OF MORAL COURAGE. IT CONCLUDES THAT FACING THE TRUTH CONCERNING PAST SILENCE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO A PROPERLY EMBEDDED RULE OF LAW AND A MORE GROUNDED NOTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LAWYER IN A CONFLICT.
984	A LIMITATION OF MOST EMPIRICAL CROSS-COUNTRY STUDIES THAT FOCUS ON DETERMINANTS OF GDP OR GDP GROWTH IS THAT THEY FAIL TO DISTINGUISH EXPLICITLY BETWEEN INPUTS USED IN PRODUCTION AND CONDITIONS THAT FACILITATE PRODUCTION. FOR EXAMPLE, PHYSICAL CAPITAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND LABOR ARE PRODUCTION INPUTS, WHEREAS THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, MACROECONOMIC STABILITY, AND MARKET QUALITY ARE CONDITIONS THAT FACILITATE PRODUCTION. THIS ARTICLE TAKES THIS DISTINCTION SERIOUSLY AND USES A STOCHASTIC FRONTIER APPROACH TO STUDY FACTORS AFFECTING ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. A PANEL DATA SET OF 71 COUNTRIES FOR THE 1980-98 PERIOD IS USED TO ESTIMATE A PRODUCTION FRONTIER WITH PHYSICAL CAPITAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND LABOR AS INPUTS. THE ARTICLE ALSO ANALYZES WHAT DRIVES PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY, USING THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, MACROECONOMIC STABILITY, MARKET QUALITY, AND URBANIZATION AS POSSIBLE EXPLANATORY FACTORS. URBANIZATION TURNS OUT TO BE AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT, WITH THE RULE OF LAW, INFLATION RATE, AND MARKET QUALITY ALSO AFFECTING PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY.
985	THIS STUDY EMPLOYS MACRODATA FOR 23 AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO EXAMINE WHETHER GOOD GOVERNANCE INTERACTS WITH ECONOMIC GLOBALISATION (EG) TO FOSTER INCLUSIVE GREEN GROWTH (IGG). FIRST, THE STUDY FINDS THAT EG HAMPERS IGG IN AFRICA. SECOND, ALTHOUGH UNCONDITIONALLY GOOD GOVERNANCE PROMOTES IGG, ONLY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INTERACTS WITH EG TO FOSTER IGG. ACROSS THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY DIMENSIONS OF IGG, HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY. NOTABLY, WHILST THE EG-GOVERNANCE PATHWAYS YIELD REMARKABLE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY NET GAINS, A MODEST HARMFUL EFFECT WAS OBSERVED FOR SOCIOECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY. EVIDENCE FROM OUR THRESHOLD ANALYSES ALSO SUGGESTS THAT WHILST GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS CRITICAL FOR PROPELLING EG TO PROMOTE IGG, ACROSS THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVES OF IGG, IT IS INVESTMENTS IN BUILDING FRAMEWORKS AND STRUCTURES FOR CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT ARE CRUCIAL. OUR RESULTS SHED NEW LIGHT ON IGG AND HAVE SEVERAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AGENDA 2030 AND AGENDA 2063.
986	THE 2012 SYRIAN CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN LARGELY (DIS)REGARDED AS EMBODYING A MERE POLICY INTENT TO PLACATE CONTESTATION, LEAVING THE RESORTS OF MONOCRATIC POWER UNTOUCHED. WHILE THIS MIGHT BE TRUE, THERE WERE FORMAL CHANGES WHOSE STUDY IS WORTHWHILE TO UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITIES FOR SOME DEGREE OF DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS ARTICLE DELVES INTO THE 2012 CHARTER AND ITS MAIN INNOVATIONS, ASKING, FIRST, FROM A DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE, WHAT ARE THE MAIN TRENDS UNDERLYING CONTEMPORARY SYRIAN CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS? SECOND, FROM AN EXPLANATORY PERSPECTIVE, WHAT SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS PREVENT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MATERIAL CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION IN DEMOCRATIC TERMS? WHAT LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS ACCOUNT FOR THIS PHENOMENON? WHILE THE 2012 FORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES CAN BE CONCEIVED AS A 'BLUEPRINT' REVEALING GOVERNMENTAL PRIORITIES, THE OUTSTANDING DEMOCRATIC DEFICITS MIGHT HELP TO IDENTIFY THE OPPOSITION'S PRIORITIES. TOGETHER, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO DELINEATE A BARGAINING RANGE FOR THE ONGOING CONSTITUENT NEGOTIATIONS.
987	POLITICAL EDUCATION MEANS PREPARING CITIZENS TO ACCEPT SOCIAL ROLES AND PERFORM POLITICAL DUTIES IN SOCIETY. WISE POLITICAL EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE EDUCATIONAL MODELS THAT IS ROOTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION OF ANCIENT GREECE AND HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY THINKERS IN DIFFERENT HISTORICAL PERIODS. IN THIS EDUCATIONAL MODEL, THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VALUES AND NORMS IS FOLLOWED IN THREE INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL AREAS OF EDUCATION. IN THIS PROCESS, THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EDUCATION OF INDIVIDUALS BEGINS FROM CHILDHOOD AND THEY ARE TAUGHT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SKILLS AND AWARENESS ON THE PATH TO DEVELOPMENT. TEACHING MORAL VIRTUES AND AVOIDING MORAL VICES IS THE BASIS OF WISE POLITICAL EDUCATION. THE INSTITUTION OF THE FAMILY HAS THE TASK OF INSTITUTIONALIZING VALUES AND NORMS SUCH AS LOVE, AFFECTION, COURAGE, FRIENDSHIP, COOPERATION AND RULE OF LAW IN CHILDREN. AND IN THE PROCESS, INDIVIDUALS ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT AND PLAY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ROLES.
988	THE "ONE BELT AND ONE ROAD" (OBOR) INITIATIVE PROPOSED BY CHINA AIMS TO PROMOTE HIGHLY EFFICIENT RESOURCE ALLOCATION, DEEP REGIONAL INTEGRATION, AND EXTENSION OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS). THE MAIN CHALLENGES FACED BY OBOR INCLUDE LARGE VARIATIONS IN REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND A HIGH DEGREE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY AMONG OBOR COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE LINKAGE BETWEEN REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND GVC PARTICIPATION. FIRST, WE SHOW THAT OBOR COUNTRIES HAVE MUCH WEAKER INSTITUTIONS AND LESS GVC PARTICIPATION THAN NON-OBOR COUNTRIES. SECOND, WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONS PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN GVC PARTICIPATION IN BOTH OBOR AND NON-OBOR COUNTRIES. IMPROVED REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND RULE OF LAW CAN SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTE GVC PARTICIPATION IN INSTITUTIONALLY SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES. FINALLY, A FIRM-LEVEL ANALYSIS THAT IS BASED ON THE WORLD BANK'S ENTERPRISE SURVEY DATA INDICATES THAT BETTER QUALITY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS ENCOURAGE FIRMS TO PARTICIPATE IN GVCS.
989	THE SUPREME COURT SOMETIMES CHOOSES TO USE ITS LIMITED TIME TO REVISIT EARLIER DECISIONS. IN DOING SO, THE JUSTICES SIGNAL THE IMPORTANCE OF REASSERTING, CORRECTING, OR RECONSIDERING THEIR ARGUMENTS. WE FIND THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE SUPREME COURT REVISITING A CASE IN A GIVEN YEAR INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE NUMBER OF CIRCUIT COURTS CRITICAL OF THAT OPINION INCREASES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE CIRCUIT COURTS INFLUENCES THE DECISION TO REVISIT CASES. EVEN IF THE COURT MERELY CLARIFIES OR REINFORCES EARLIER OPINIONS, CRITICISM IN THE CIRCUITS PROMPTS THE COURT TO TAKE SOME ACTION. THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT'S WORD IS FINAL, BARRING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR LEGISLATIVE OVERRIDE IN NONCONSTITUTIONAL CASES, THE MECHANISM OF CRITICISM IN THE CIRCUITS ALLOWS RECONSIDERATION OF MANY ISSUES ALREADY DECIDED BY THE COURT AND SHEDS LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
990	EXISTING RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE IDEAS OF JUDGES SHAPE THEIR BEHAVIOUR. A NATURAL NEXT QUESTION TO ASK IS, WHERE DO THESE IDEAS COME FROM? YET, THERE IS LITTLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE REGARDING THE CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THESE IDEAS AND EVEN LESS EVIDENCE REGARDING THE SOURCES OF THESE IDEAS, ESPECIALLY HOW IDEAS TRANSFER OR DIFFUSE AMONG JUDGES. IN THIS ARTICLE, A SURVEY OF JUDGES IN THE MEXICAN STATE OF MICHOACAN GENERATES ORIGINAL DATA ON THE ATTITUDES AND PROFESSIONAL TIES AMONG THESE LEGAL ELITES, AND A MIXED-METHODS DESIGN EXAMINES THE DIFFUSION OF THESE ATTITUDES ALONG THESE TIES, SEQUENCING QUANTITATIVE NETWORK ANALYSES AND INTERVIEWS WITH JUDGES TO STRENGTHEN CAUSAL INFERENCES. THE CORE FINDING THAT THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF JUDGES INFLUENCES THE ATTITUDES JUDGES HOLD CONTRIBUTES A VALUABLE ANALYTIC COMPLEMENT TO SCHOLARSHIP ON COMPARATIVE JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR, AND CLARIFIES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL NETWORKS IN STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
991	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE BRITISH STATE AND LOYALIST PARAMILITARY ORGANISATIONS DURING THE CONFLICT IN NORTHERN IRELAND IN THE CONTEXT OF BRITISH COUNTERINSURGENCY THEORY AND PRACTICES IN PRIOR COLONIAL CAMPAIGNS. IT BRIEFLY OUTLINES THE NATURE, PATTERN AND LOGIC OF COLLUSION IN NORTHERN IRELAND BEFORE EXAMINING SOME OF THE KEY WORKS OF BRITISH COUNTERINSURGENCY THEORISTS - CHARLES CALLWELL, CHARLES GWYNN AND FRANK KITSON - REFLECTING ON EARLIER IMPERIAL EXPERIENCES. COLLUSION IS UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPEDIENT COERCIVE STATE PRACTICE, PREMISED ON A DOCTRINE OF NECESSITY', DESIGNED TO REMOVE ENEMIES' AND INDUCE FEAR IN A TARGET POPULATION VIA A STRATEGY OF ASSASSINATION IN WHICH THE APPEARANCE OF ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IS A POLITICAL END SHAPING THE SPECIFIC FORMS OF STATE VIOLENCE INVOLVED. SUCH A PRACTICE, THE AUTHOR ARGUES, IS NOT AN ABERRATION IN THE TRADITION OF BRITISH STATE COUNTERINSURGENCY VIOLENCE, IT IS EXEMPLARY.
992	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DETERMINANTS OF NET INTEREST MARGINS (NIMS) IN FOUR REGIONAL BLOCKS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). USING BANK-LEVEL DATA, WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF OPERATING COSTS, A LOW LEVEL OF NON-INTEREST INCOME, A HIGH RATIO OF EQUITY TO TOTAL ASSETS AND HIGH TREASURY-BILL INTEREST RATES HAVE HIGHER NIMS. MOREOVER, HIGH OPERATING COSTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND A SMALL SIZE OF BANK OPERATIONS. WE FIND SUPPORT FOR THE VIEW THAT MARKET STRUCTURE IS ALSO PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGH NIMS IN SSA, ALTHOUGH QUANTITATIVELY THIS EFFECT IS SOMEWHAT LESS IMPORTANT. HIGH OPERATING COSTS, HIGH TREASURY-BILL RATES AND A HIGH RATIO OF EQUITY TO TOTAL ASSETS AND, INDIRECTLY, INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN ACCOUNTING FOR HIGH INTEREST MARGINS IN THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY, RELATIVE TO OTHER REGIONS.
993	AT THE TIME OF THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF THE DETENTION CENTRE IN GUANTANAMO BAY, MANY ARE WONDERING ABOUT THE REASONS OF ITS VERY EXISTENCE IN A COUNTRY THAT PURPORTS TO BE THE DEFENDER OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATIONS (BOTH US AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW) THAT ARE APPLIED TO THE DETAINEES. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE VIOLATIONS OF BASIC PRINCIPLES OF LAW THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND CONTINUE TO OCCUR, SUCH AS DENIAL OF ACCESS TO ORDINARY COURTS AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL IN CASE OF DETENTION, AS WELL AS BREACHES OF THE PROTECTIONS AND GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR ANALYSES THE REASONS THAT HAVE ALLOWED THE CENTRE TO REMAIN IN OPERATION DESPITE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PLEDGE TO CLOSE IT, WHICH HE MADE EARLY ON IN HIS TERM.
994	A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM IS THAT NOBODY, REGARDLESS OF HIS STATUS IN SOCIETY, IS ABOVE THE LAW. CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN THE 1990S SAW THE INTRODUCTION IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES OF CONSTITUTIONS WHICH FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDE SOME PROSPECTS FOR PROMOTING CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE REFORMS HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF PRESIDENTIAL ABSOLUTISM AND THE ABUSES THAT GO WITH IT. IT EXAMINES SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT MADE AFRICAN PRESIDENTS TO BE SO POWERFUL THAT THE CONVENTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES COULD NOT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCESSES. IT ALSO REVIEWS THE ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT IMPUNITY THROUGH IMMUNITY PROVISIONS. IT CONCLUDES THAT UNFORTUNATELY, THE 1990 REFORMS DID NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF PRESIDENTIAL ABSOLUTISM. A NUMBER OF WAYS, NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, IN WHICH PRESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTABILITY COULD BE ENHANCED AND THE CULTURE OF IMPUNITY ENDED IS SUGGESTED.
995	SOCIAL CHANGES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BROUGHT NEW PROBLEMS IN DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIPS. IN MANY CLINICAL CONTEXTS CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS MISUSED, WITH NEGATIVE EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND INSTITUTIONS. THE PAPER AIMS TO CLARIFY WHAT CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION MEANS IN A PLURAL SOCIETY BASED ON A DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY AND TO SHOW THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THIS SOCIETY IN ORDER TO RESPECT BOTH THE ETHICAL REASONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE COMPULSORY NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES SOME CLINICAL SETTINGS WHERE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS OFTEN INVOKED BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, AND POINTS OUT AND ANALYSES THE ARGUMENTS THAT EXPLAIN WHY THIS APPEAL FOR CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS NEITHER LEGITIMATE NOR CORRECT. FINALLY, IT PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF THE LEGAL BASIS AND SPANISH JURISPRUDENCE, AS WELL AS THE RELEVANT CLINICAL AND ETHICAL LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. (C) 2011 SECA. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER ESPANA, S.L.

996	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES FOR THE FIRST TIME SYSTEMATIC PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOUNGER AND OLDER DEMOCRACIES AND ARGUES THAT THESE ARE DRIVEN BY THE INABILITY OF POLITICAL COMPETITORS TO MAKE BROADLY CREDIBLE PREELECTORAL PROMISES TO VOTERS. YOUNGER DEMOCRACIES ARE MORE CORRUPT; EXHIBIT LESS RULE OF LAW, LOWER LEVELS OF BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT, AND MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THE MEDIA; AND SPEND MORE ON PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND GOVERNMENT WORKERS. THIS PATTERN IS EXACTLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF KEEFER AND VLAICU (N.D.). THE INABILITY OF POLITICAL COMPETITORS TO MAKE CREDIBLE PROMISES TO CITIZENS LEADS THEM TO PREFER CLIENTELIST POLICIES: TO UNDERPROVIDE NONTARGETED GOODS, TO OVERPROVIDE TARGETED TRANSFERS TO NARROW GROUPS OF VOTERS, AND TO ENGAGE IN EXCESSIVE RENT SEEKING. OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT YOUNG DEMOCRACIES EXHIBIT, INCLUDING DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS, GREATER EXPOSURE TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE, AND GREATER SOCIAL FRAGMENTATION, DO NOT EXPLAIN, EITHER THEORETICALLY OR EMPIRICALLY, THESE POLICY CHOICES.
997	PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESS HOW THE MOBILE PHONE CAN BE LEVERAGED UPON TO IMPROVE THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN 44 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS USED TO ESTABLISH POLICY THRESHOLDS. A THRESHOLD IS A CRITICAL MASS OR LEVEL OF MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION AT WHICH THE NET EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS CHANGES FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE. FINDINGS MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION THRESHOLDS ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE CONDITIONAL EFFECTS ARE: 36 (PER 100 PEOPLE) FOR POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE; 130 (PER 100 PEOPLE) FOR REGULATION QUALITY; 146.66 (PER 100 PEOPLE) FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; 65 (PER 100 PEOPLE) FOR CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND 130 (PER 100 PEOPLE) FOR THE RULE OF LAW. PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE STUDY PROVIDES THRESHOLDS OF MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION THAT ARE CRITICAL IN COMPLEMENTING GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS.
998	THE MANTRA OF 'TAKE BACK CONTROL' HAS BECOME A STAPLE OF EUROSCEPTICS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION. AT THE CENTRE OF THE SLOGAN'S MESSAGE IS A CALL TO ARMS AGAINST THE (PERCEIVED) CHALLENGE THAT EU MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTS FOR NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. IN THIS PAPER, WE THEORIZE THAT SUPRANATIONAL DECISIONS TAKEN BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE CAN INCREASE 'POLITY SCEPTICISM' - INCREASED OPPOSITION TO THE EU AND DECREASED SATISFACTION WITH NATIONAL DEMOCRACY - BY CUEING CITIZENS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF EU INTEGRATION ON THE PERCEPTION OF DILUTED SOVEREIGNTY. EMPIRICALLY, WE LEVERAGE QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT OUR THEORY, ESTABLISHING THAT ECJ RULINGS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL EFFECT ON EUROSCEPTICISM AND DISSATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY. THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EU INSTITUTIONS SEEKING TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND EU NORMS SHOULD PROCEED WITH CAUTION. INTERVENTIONIST ACTION MAY BACKFIRE BY INCREASING SCRUTINY OF THE EU'S LEGITIMACY AND UNDERMINING POLITY SUPPORT.
999	CANDLELIGHT PROTESTS WERE HELD IN 2016 AND 2017 IN SOUTH KOREA. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GATHERED DOWNTOWN WITH CANDLES IN THEIR HANDS, AND IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS AN UNPRECEDENTED COLLECTIVE ACTION IN THE HISTORY OF KOREAN POLITICS. THIS STUDY ANALYZES HOW THE CANDLELIGHT PROTESTS DEVELOPED AND ACHIEVED THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT. DRAWING ON POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY THEORY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY WAS FORMULATED IN THE PROCESS AND OUTCOME OF THESE CANDLELIGHT PROTESTS. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THREE PROPERTIES THAT SERVED AS ENABLING CONDITIONS EMBEDDED IN THIS CASE: (1) POLITICAL FREEDOMS GUARANTEED IN THE EXISTING FORMAL INSTITUTIONS; (2) POLITICAL ELITES IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE PROTESTERS AND THE RULE OF LAW; AND (3) LOW RISK OF STATE REPRESSION OF LAW-ABIDING COLLECTIVE ACTION. OVERALL, THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES WERE SUFFICIENTLY ESTABLISHED IN KOREAN SOCIETY FOR CITIZENS TO TAKE COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THEIR PROTESTS LED TO THE DESIRED OUTCOME.
