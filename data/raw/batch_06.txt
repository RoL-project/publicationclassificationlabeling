0	THERE IS A MANIFEST AND CURRENT INSTABILITY OF THE SUBSTRUCTURES OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL, WHICH AFFECTS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SECTORS, REFLECTING THE PANDEMIC OF 2020 (SORS-COV-2), THIS SITUATION DOES NOT EXEMPT PRISONS, WHICH ARE ALREADY DELICATE AND ALARMING IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IN VIEW OF THIS, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT REALITY OF PRISONS IN SCOURGES POSSIBLY HARDENED BY SORS-COV-2, IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE 32 YEARS OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION OF 1988. THEREFORE, A BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND DOCUMENTAR STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT, QUALITATIVELY, TO EXPLORE THE PRISONS, CONFIRMING OR REFUTING THE AGGRAVATION OF THE RESEARCHED LOCUS. IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE HISTORICAL SCOURGES OF PRISONS ARE WORRYING AS THE PANDEMIC ADVANCES, WHICH SHOWS THE CONSIDERABLE AND EXPRESSIVE UNPREPAREDNESS OF PRISON ADMINISTRATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE CONTINUED INEFFICIENCY OF PRISON POLICIES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL NROMS ORE CONFIRMED.
1	THE GOVERNMENTS OF HUNGARY AND POLAND HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF SLIDING TOWARD SEMI-AUTHORITARIANISM. SYSTEMATIC ANALYSES OF THE RESPONSES OF POLITICAL ACTORS AT THE EU LEVEL TO THESE INSTANCES OF ALLEGED DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING ARE SCARCE, HOWEVER. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE INVESTIGATES THE RESPONSES OF MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (MEPS) TO THE ISSUE OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. ON THE BASIS OF DATA ON PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS AND MOTIONS FOR RESOLUTIONS, WE ANALYSE WHO PUTS THESE ISSUES ON THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT'S (EP'S) INTERNAL AGENDA AND WHAT POSITIONS LEGISLATORS SUBSEQUENTLY TAKE IN VOTES ON RESOLUTIONS. WE FIND THAT BOTH IDEOLOGICAL PREFERENCES AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS DETERMINE MEPS' RESPONSES TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. OUR FINDINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR RESEARCH ON EU RESPONSES TO DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN EU MEMBER STATES AS WELL AS FOR THE LITERATURE ON PARTY COMPETITION IN THE EP.
2	THE PRESENT PAPER DEALS WITH THE DECISION OF THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO REFER A PRELIMINARY RULING TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ON THE WELL-KNOWN CASE TARICCO. THE LATTER, IN 2015, STATED THAT THE ITALIAN LAW ON STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, HAVING REGARD TO THE OBLIGATION UPON MEMBER STATES, STEMMING FROM ART. 325 TFUE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT FOUND THAT SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED NORM COULD BRING TO A VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CRIMINAL MATTERS, WITH PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE PROHIBITION OF RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL LAW IN PEIUS, INTENDED AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. SUCH AN INCONSISTENCY, IF THE ECJ WILL NOT SOLVE IT THROUGH A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF ART. 325, WILL BRING TO THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAW OF EXECUTION OF THE TFUE.
3	WITHIN THE DEBATE ON FREEDOM OF RELIGION IN TURKEY, WE CAN IDENTIFY TWO DISTINCT GENERATIONS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE ALIVE WITH AN OSCILLATING DEGREE OF VIBRANCY. THE FIRST GENERATION OF DEBATE HAS EVOLVED AROUND THE QUESTION ON THE PROPER PLACE OF ISLAM IN THE SECULAR NATION-STATE; WHILE THE SECOND ONE HAS ENCOMPASSED THE PLURAL CONCERNS OF PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, PERTAINING TO RELIGION OR BELIEF, OF A DIVERSE MULTITUDE, UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE FIRST GENERATION OF DEBATE RESULTED IN A DUAL DEADLOCK: FREEDOM TO RELIGION VERSUS FREEDOM FROM RELIGION. THE SECOND GENERATION IS INFORMED BY A PLURALISATION OF PARTIES AND CONCERNS. THE FIRST GENERATION HAS PRODUCED WELL-ESTABLISHED RESULTS IN JURISPRUDENCE, WHERE THE EFFECT OF THE SECOND GENERATION IS FAR FROM BEING SIGNIFICANT. YET, AS THIS PAPER WILL EXPLAIN IN CONCLUSION, WE HAVE GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT THE SECOND GENERATION TO PREVAIL OVER THE FIRST ONE.
4	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO EMERGING LITERATURE DOCUMENTING THE DEVOLUTION OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY BY FOCUSING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 287(G) PROGRAM IN DAVIDSON COUNTY, TENNESSEE. IT OUTLINES HOW DEPUTIZED IMMIGRATION OFFICERS DO THEIR WORK AS WELL AS THE WAYS THEY COME TO THINK ABOUT THEIR ROLES IN THE LARGER IMMIGRATION BUREAUCRACY. IMMIGRATION OFFICERS SEE THEMSELVES AS OBJECTIVE ADMINISTRATORS WHOSE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TO IDENTIFY AND PROCESS IMMIGRANTS FOR REMOVAL, BUT WHO ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SUBSEQUENT DEPORTATION. WHILE IMMIGRATION OFFICERS NEVER WAIVER ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, ALTERNATE NARRATIVES EMERGE DEPENDING ON HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE IMMIGRANTS THEY ENCOUNTER. THESE FRAMES RANGE FROM PRIDE AT IDENTIFYING CRIMINAL ALIENS TO GUILT FOR PROCESSING IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR VERY MINOR VIOLATIONS. ULTIMATELY, THIS WORK SHOWS DEPUTIZED IMMIGRATION OFFICERS ACT AS EXTENSIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RATHER THAN AS INDEPENDENT AGENTS.
5	IN 2005, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FREE ACEH MOVEMENT (GAM) SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BRINGING ALMOST 30 YEARS OF VIOLENT CONFLICT IN ACEH TO AN END. AT THE CENTRE OF THE AGREEMENT WAS THE PROVISION OF AN AMNESTY FOR GAM COMBATANTS THAT HAS BEEN WIDELY CITED AS ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ACEH PEACE PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE PRICE PAID FOR THAT PEACE AND ITS IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN POSTCONFLICT ACEH. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT ALTHOUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN RIGHTS CULTURE HAS NOT EVENTUATED IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THE ACEHNESE WAR ENDED, GENERAL PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF AMNESTIES HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED IN THIS CASE. RATHER THAN LEAVING A SIGNIFICANT DEBT, IN THIS CASE PEACE HAS PURCHASED DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS AND MARKED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MATERIAL RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
6	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES ISSUES RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW, ITS ASPECTS RELATED TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE CURRENT CHALLENGES FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THE BRAZILIAN STATE DOES NOT GUARANTEE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, WHETHER DUE TO LACK OF INTEREST OR INCAPACITY, AND THAT IS WHY IT BECOMES A STATE OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL MALAISE. ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS POINT TO A VERTIGINOUS GROWTH IN ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION, THERE IS AN ALMOST GENERALIZED STATE INEFFICIENCY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AND IN THE EXECUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES WHOSE AIM IS TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS. THERE IS THE RISK OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE; WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS INTENSIFIED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE STATE ENDS UP TAKING ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES BY MAINTAINING, UNDER NEOLIBERAL IDEAS, THE SAME STRUCTURE (OR DOWNSIZING IT). HOWEVER, ABNORMAL TIMES ARE PRODIGAL IN NEW DEMANDS FOR NEW RIGHTS OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS.
7	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A TRANSNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON CANADA'S LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE TO GLOBALLY EXPANDED NATIONAL SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES IN THE WAR ON TERROR SINCE 2001. I SITUATE CANADA'S NEW LEGISLATION AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF US AND JAPANESE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSES AND ANALYZE THE TRANSITION, INCLUDING BILL C-13 (2014), BILL C-44 (2015), BILL C-51 (2015), AND BILL C-59 (2019). I ARGUE THAT THE THRUST OF THIS LEGISLATIVE TREND HAS BEEN THE ACTIVE LEGALIZATION OF PREVIOUSLY ILLEGAL SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES BY SECURITY INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, RATHER THAN PASSIVE INEFFECTIVENESS IN RESTRICTING STATE MASS SURVEILLANCE ENABLED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. THE TRANSITION IS IN SYNCH WITH A GLOBAL LEGISLATIVE TREND THAT LOWERS THE LEGAL STANDARDS OF PRIVACY AND PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION AND WEAKENS CHECKS AND BALANCES IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. AS A RESULT, MASS SURVEILLANCE HAS INCREASINGLY UNDERMINED AND REGULATED THE RULE OF LAW, NOT VICE VERSA.
8	THE NEGATIVE AND CORROSIVE IMPACTS OF CORRUPTION IN THE FIELDS OF ECONOMICS, POLITICS, AND LAW ARE WIDELY DISCUSSED. LESS UNDERSTOOD ARE THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF ANTI-CORRUPTION STRUGGLES AND STRATEGIES THEMSELVES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CASE STUDY OF BRAZIL'S 'CAR WASH' ('LAVA JATO') SCANDAL FROM A LEGAL AND POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. ALTHOUGH THE SUBSEQUENT OPERATION CAR WASH INVESTIGATION WAS WIDELY REGARDED AS REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL, SUPPOSEDLY BUTTRESSING THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH HIGH-PROFILE PROSECUTIONS OF LEADING POLITICIANS AND BUSINESSPERSONS, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LEGAL DUE PROCESS, WIDER CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND THE POLITICAL PROCESS WERE UNDERMINED. WHILE THE USE OF MEDIA LEAKS TO STRENGTHEN THE INVESTIGATION PROVED TACTICALLY SUCCESSFUL, WHEN COUPLED WITH NEW LEGAL INSTRUMENTS IT UNDERMINED THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND CONTRIBUTED TO A CLIMATE IN WHICH POLITICAL AND LEGAL DEBATES THEMSELVES BECAME INCREASINGLY SUBORDINATED TO SIMPLISTIC POLARIZING ANTI-CORRUPTION DISCOURSES, THEREBY UNDERMINING AN ALREADY FRAGILE POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT.
9	THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY IS AN INDISPUTABLE FACT OF OUR PRESENT. IN PART, HOWEVER, THIS CRISIS IS ALSO A PROBLEM OF INTERPRETATION BECAUSE, FROM THE MODERN ORIGINS OF PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICAL THEORY, DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN THOUGHT FROM THE IDEAS OF UNITY AND CONSENSUS: UNITY OF A PEOPLE AND BASIC POLITICAL CONSENSUS CONTAINING THE DIFFERENCES THAT ARE CONVEYED THROUGH THE MULTIPLICITY OF PARTIES WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS MODEL IS THE ONE THAT DOES NOT FIT WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PRESENT. I PROPOSE A CHANGE OF MODEL FINDING INSPIRATION ON THE THOUGHT OF JEAN-FRANCOIS LYOTARD ACCEPTING THE PRIMACY OF INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFERENCES AND UNDERSTANDING SOME ASPECTS OF POLITICS IN SOME SIMILARITIES WITH AESTHETICS. LYOTARD TURNED TO THE KANT OF THE CRITIQUE OF THE POWER OF JUDGEMENT TO ANALYZE SOME OF THESE SIMILARITIES AND TO APPROACH, AS HANNAH ARENDT DID, ALTHOUGH OTHERWISE, THE POLITICAL JUDGMENT TO THE AESTHETIC JUDGMENT.
10	REGULATORY GOVERNANCE IS CONSIDERED AS A NEW ERA IN THE STATE'S INTERVENTION, AND IT IS VITAL TO FOSTER BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCES OF REGULATORS. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE ABSENCE OF GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES ALLOWS REGULATORS TO JUSTIFY THE ADOPTION OF INSTRUMENTS TO IMPROVE IT. FIVE CORE REGULATORY PRINCIPLES, PARTICULARLY ACCOUNTABILITY, ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY, OPEN GOVERNMENT, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW BUILD THE BRIDGE BETWEEN REGULATORY GOVERNANCE AND REGULATORY SUBSTANCE. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE THE APPLICATION OF A MULTICRITERIA MODELLING METHOD (ELECTRE TRI-C) IN ORDER TO CONDUCT THE ASSESSMENT AND CATEGORIZATION OF BRAZILIAN SUBNATIONAL REGULATORS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENCE OF GOVERNANCE, ENCOMPASSING THE OPINIONS OF LEGITIMATE STAKEHOLDERS. THE LEVELS OF REGULATORY GOVERNANCE ARE CALCULATED FOR THE REGULATORS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME DETERMINANTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, WHICH COULD BE STIMULATED BY REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT, AS A POLICY TOOL THAT IMPROVES INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS.
11	IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT DISPLAY BOARDS ARE BEING APPLIED WIDELY BY PRIMARY SCHOOLS AS VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING ABOUT THE STATED FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE MUTUAL RESPECT AND TOLERANCE OF THOSE WITH DIFFERENT FAITHS AND BELIEFS. THE RESEARCH PRESENTED BY THIS ARTICLE IS BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF 27 DISPLAY BOARDS FROM PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACROSS ENGLAND, INCLUDING FINDINGS FROM IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH THREE PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS. WE WANTED TO IDENTIFY AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW DISCOURSES OF BRITISH NATIONAL IDENTITY SUCH AS MONOCULTURALISM AND MULTICULTURALISM ARE REIFIED BY SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS THROUGH THE IMAGERY USED ON PRIMARY SCHOOL DISPLAY BOARDS IN THE REPRESENTATION OF FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES. OUR RESEARCH MAKES AN ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE ON TEACHING AND LEARNING ABOUT NATIONAL IDENTITY, BY OFFERING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BOTH OF REPRESENTATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES AND OF TEACHER INTERPRETATIONS OF THE POLICY.
12	CARE ORDERS WITHIN THE CHILD PROTECTION SYSTEM ARE SOME OF THE MOST INVASIVE INTERVENTIONS A STATE CAN MAKE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DISCRETIONARY SPACE GOVERNMENTS SET OUT FOR CHILD PROTECTION WORKERS WHEN THEY PREPARE CARE ORDERS. WE ANALYSE THE FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR THESE DECISIONS IN ENGLAND, FINLAND, NORWAY AND THE UNITED STATES. WE FOCUS ON KNOWLEDGE, TIMELINES, HOW CHILDREN AND PARENTS ARE INVOLVED AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE FIND THAT NORWAY AND FINLAND HAVE HIGHLY DE-REGULATED SYSTEMS WITH WIDE DISCRETIONARY SPACE, WHEREAS ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED SYSTEMS WITH NARROW DISCRETIONARY SPACE. THE UNITED STATES DIFFERENTIATES ITSELF WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE PARENT AND/OR CHILD INVOLVEMENT IN DECISION-MAKING. ENGLAND AND FINLAND DO NOT HAVE DEFINED DEADLINES FOR TERMINATING THE PROCESS, AND NORWAY HAS FEW DIRECTIVES ON WHAT INFORMATION TO COLLECT. SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF DECISIONS AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
13	CONGRESS PASSES STATUTES DEFINING PARTICULAR AREAS OF THE LAW, BUT THE SUPREME COURT CAN INTERPRET THOSE STATUTES. THIS TENSION OVER THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRATIC THEORY AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THOUGH SCHOLARS HAVE EXAMINED WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT ISSUES DECISIONS AGAINST THE PREFERENCES OF CONGRESS, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE FOCUS ON WHETHER LEGISLATORS CAN CONSTRAIN THE COURT. OUR STUDY EXAMINES HOW MUCH DISCRETION CONGRESS PROVIDES IN STATUTES IT ENACTS INTO LAW. OUR BASIC ARGUMENT IS THAT IDEOLOGICAL DECISION MAKING BY SUPREME COURT JUSTICES DEPENDS UPON THE LEVEL OF DISCRETION CONGRESS INCORPORATES INTO THE LAW. THE GREATER THE DISCRETION, THE LESS CONSTRAINT FEDERAL JUDGES AND JUSTICES WILL ENCOUNTER, MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO VOTE ACCORDING TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL IDEOLOGIES. CONVERSELY, MORE DETAILED STATUTES WILL REDUCE THE JUDGES' DISCRETION. USING DATA ON 1953-96 SUPREME COURT DECISIONS, OUR ANALYSIS SUPPORTS THIS MODEL OF CONTINGENT DISCRETION.
14	LEGAL BIAS AGAINST THE POOR, AND COMPETITION FROM NONSTATE LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDERS, CAN BOTH SERIOUSLY AFFECT STATE JUSTICE PROVISION. BUT ANALYSES OF THESE FACTORS OFTEN FAIL TO INCORPORATE A CRITICAL FEATURE OF JUSTICE SYSTEMS: STATES USE THEM FOR REVENUE GENERATION. I BUILD A SERIES OF FORMAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE FACTORS INTERACT. I DERIVE SEVERAL INSIGHTS INTO EMPIRICAL PATTERNS OF BIAS, COMPETITION, ACCESS TO JUSTICE, AND LEGAL SYSTEM VIABILITY. FIRST, IN POOR COUNTRIES, BIAS CAN INCREASE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND LEGAL EFFECTIVENESS. SECOND, GIVEN COMPETITION, POOR GROUPS WILL PAY A PREMIUM FOR STATE-PROVIDED JUSTICE, WHILE WEALTHY GROUPS WILL PAY A PREMIUM FOR PRIVATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. HOWEVER, LOSING A POOR GROUP TO COMPETITION IS ALSO LESS COSTLY THAN LOSING A WEALTHY GROUP, AND THE LATTER LOSS CAN SOMETIMES DESTROY THE VIABILITY OF THE STATE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THESE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF STATE CAPACITY AND RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT.
15	MANY OBSERVATIONS OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION INTO THE ROBODEBT SCHEME UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE UNIQUE PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT LAWYERS, AND THE IMPERATIVE OF STRUCTURING LEGAL SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THE LAWYERS TO FULFIL THOSE OBLIGATIONS, AND ULTIMATELY, THEREFORE, ASSIST IN GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE ROBODEBT COMMISSION REVEALS INSTANCES OF SIGNIFICANT FAILURES IN THE PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL PRACTICE OF LAWYERS WORKING FOR GOVERNMENT, WITH VERY REAL AND HUMAN CONSEQUENCES. THESE INTERSECT WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE REGARDING THE STRUCTURE OF LEGAL SERVICES FOR GOVERNMENT, AND SUPPORT PROVIDED TO LAWYERS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I EXPLAIN THE UNIQUE POSITION FILLED BY GOVERNMENT LAWYERS, THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY WAY IN WHICH LEGAL SERVICES ARE STRUCTURED AT THE COMMONWEALTH LEVEL IN AUSTRALIA, BEFORE TURNING TO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE ROBODEBT ROYAL COMMISSION AS THEY RELATE TO GOVERNMENT LAWYERS.
16	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE DYNAMIC IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERN-MENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNT-ABILITY) ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION ACROSS SEVENTY-THREE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE CONDUCT MULTIPLE DYNAMIC-PANEL-DATA APPROACHES TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY, CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCY, AND ENDOGENEITY ISSUES. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY PROMOTES BOTH THE ACCESS TO AND THE USE OF FORMAL FINANCIAL SERVICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX, DOMESTIC CREDIT, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX (THE DEPTH & ACCESS TO FINANCE, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS), AND RE-MITTANCES SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO FINANCIAL INCLUSION. OUR FINDINGS ALSO CONFIRM OUR PROPOSITION THAT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DRIVING FINANCIAL INCLUSION. THIS STUDY PRO-VIDES SEVERAL PRACTICAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AIMING TO STRENGTHEN THEIR INSTITUTION-INDUCED FINANCIAL MARKET DEEPENING.
17	THIS META-ANALYSIS ATTEMPTS TO SYNTHESIZE AND REVIEW DECADES OF RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AND HOST COUNTRY FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) ATTRACTIVENESS. USING PRIOR TESTS DERIVED FROM 97 PRIMARY STUDIES, WE FIND SUPPORT FOR PRIOR THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS POLITICAL STABILITY, DEMOCRACY, AND RULE OF LAW ATTRACT FDI, WHILE OTHERS SUCH AS CORRUPTION, TAX RATES AND CULTURAL DISTANCE DETER IT. FURTHER EVIDENCE SUGGESTS A NEED FOR EXPLORATION OF MODERATING FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE PREVIOUS KEY FINDINGS. SPECIFICALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS SUCH AS LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT, REGION OF DESTINATION, AND COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT HAVE VARYING INFLUENCE ON THE STRENGTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. WE ALSO EXPLORE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC MODERATING VARIABLES, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL ANALYSES. WE CONCLUDE WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH THAT STRESS A CALL FOR FURTHER CONTEXTUALIZATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP.
18	THIS ARTICLE RAISES A DISSENTING VOICE AGAINST THE WIDESPREAD SCHOLARLY VIEW THAT DISCRETION IN REMEDYING LEGISLATIVE INFRINGEMENT OF RIGHTS CAN BE DIALOGIC, GENTLE, AND COOPERATIVE. IT FOCUSES ON DELAYED AND PROSPECTIVE ORDERS UNDER THE CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN BILL OF RIGHTS. SCHOLARS HAVE NEGLECTED REMEDIAL DISCRETION'S SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. IT HARMS LITIGANTS AND OTHER RIGHT BEARERS, POTENTIALLY PRODUCING PERVERSE SYSTEMIC EFFECTS. IN PARTICULAR, KEEPING A RIGHTS-INFRINGING CRIMINAL PROHIBITION TEMPORARILY IN FORCE IS UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE LEGAL CERTAINTY AND RISKS UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW. FAR FROM BEING RESTRAINED AND DEFERENTIAL, REMEDIAL DISCRETION INCREASES THE REACH OF JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING AND ENABLES JUDGES TO SHAPE NEW LAW MORE BOLDLY. THE WIDESPREAD EXERCISE OF REMEDIAL DISCRETION CALLS FOR REFASHIONING THE CONCEPTION OF A BILL OF RIGHTS' PLACE IN A SUPREME CONSTITUTION. IF DELAYED OR PROSPECTIVE REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES APPROPRIATE, THEY ARE NOT SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.
19	IN THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) AND COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE. WE INCLUDE IN OUR FRAMEWORK THE FIVE FACTORS OF ICTS: ACCESS, QUALITY, AFFORDABILITY, APPLICATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY & SUSTAINABILITY. GOVERNANCE INDICATORS INCLUDE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. USING SECONDARY DATA ON ICTS AND GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FOR COUNTRIES FROM THE WORLD BANK, AND CONTROLLING FOR THE WEALTH EFFECT, OUR MAIN MULTIVARIATE RESULT INDICATES THAT ICTS-WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY FACTOR-HAVE A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. ICTS THEREFORE, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNANCE. WE ALSO FIND THAT ACCESSIBILITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ICTS' FACTOR TO ENHANCE GOVERNANCE. OUR RESULTS ARE USEFUL IN SHAPING POLICY DECISIONS INVOLVING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF INVESTMENT IN ICT INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL.
20	THE YUGOSLAV CASE IS A VIVID ILLUSTRATION OF JUST HOW CONTINGENT JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IS UPON REGIME LEGITIMATION. AS THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN YUGOSLAV STATE UNITY ENTERED A CRITICAL STAGE IN 1990-91, THE COUNTRY'S "CONSTITUTIONAL JUDICIARY," WHICH HAD BEEN A PILLAR OF "SOCIALIST LEGALITY" WITHIN THE TITOIST AND SELF-MANAGEMENT LEGAL ORDER, PROVED HELPLESS TO PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. MOREOVER, THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WAS INCREASINGLY SUBJECT TO POLITICAL PRESSURES FROM RECENTLY ASCENDANT NATIONALIST POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH, ALTHOUGH PROGRAMMATICALLY COMMITTED TO THE "RULE-OF-LAW" AND ALSO TO THE "DEPOLITICIZATION" OF THE JUDICIARY, WERE, NEVERTHELESS, PREPARED TO UTILIZE THE JUDICIAL SECTOR AND LEGAL SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL GOALS. COMMUNIST POLITICAL CONTROL OVER THE COURTS HAD LARGELY BEEN ELIMINATED, BUT YUGOSLAVIA AS A WHOLE, AND ITS INDIVIDUAL REGIONS, WERE STILL A LONG WAY FROM THE CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, LET ALONE A POST-COMMUNIST RECHTSSTAAT.
21	INTERNATIONAL LAW IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE UNIVERSALLY BINDING NORMS FOR THE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE OF STATES WITH EQUAL RIGHTS. FOR SOME YEARS, RUSSIA HAS BEEN TURNING AWAY FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY AND TRYING TO ESTABLISH ITS OWN REGIONAL INTERNATIONAL LAW REGIME, REFERENCING A "MULTIPOLAR WORLD ORDER." FOR RUSSIA, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE NO LONGER THE PILLARS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH ALSO INFLUENCES DOMESTIC STRUCTURES. RATHER, RUSSIA SEES ITSELF AS A "HISTORICAL GREAT POWER" AND IS RECLAIMING ABSOLUTE STATE SOVEREIGNTY. THE ASSOCIATED CLAIM TO NON-INTERFERENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. RUSSIAN POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS CONSIDER TREATY OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES TO BE ANACHRONISTIC AND IRRELEVANT. THEY JUSTIFY THIS BY SAYING THAT THE CONTRACTING PARTIES HAVE ADOPTED A HOSTILE POSITION TOWARD RUSSIA. RUSSIA IS TAKING AN AXE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW.
22	CROSS-BORDER ALLIANCES EXPOSE FIRMS TO HEIGHTENED RISKS, POSING DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL CHALLENGES THAN DOMESTIC ALLIANCES. WE EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENCES IN ALLIANCE PARTNER COUNTRIES??? INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. ANALYSIS OF SURVEY DATA SUPPORTS OUR CONTENTION THAT CROSS-BORDER ALLIANCES INVOLVE A GREATER RELIANCE ON FORMAL CONTROLS, PARTICULARLY WHEN FIRMS COLLABORATE WITH PARTNERS IN COUNTRIES WITH A WEAKER INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THESE RELATIONS EXIST REGARDLESS OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE (I.E., EQUITY OR NON-EQUITY ALLIANCE) THAT PRIOR RESEARCH CONSIDERS A CRITICAL CHOICE FOR ADDRESSING CROSS-BORDER ALLIANCE RISKS. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES SHOW THAT FOUR SUBDIMENSIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AND ONE SUBDIMENSION OF FORMAL CONTROLS (BEHAVIOR CONTROLS) ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE AND RELIANCE ON FORMAL CONTROLS. THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE DISTINCT IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS A COUNTRY-LEVEL DETERMINANT OF ALLIANCE CONTROL CHOICES.
23	DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS RISKS AS THEY OPEN THEIR ECONOMIES. WHILE BECOMING MORE INTEGRATED WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND REMOVING TRADE BARRIERS IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY IN RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND INCREASE WELFARE, IN MANY COUNTRIES THIS DOES NOT OCCUR. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF TRADE OPENNESS, ITS IMPACT ON POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES IS SIGNIFICANT FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS REMOVING TRADE BARRIERS IN PURSUIT OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION CAN LEAD TO RENT-SEEKING ACTIVITIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF TRADE OPENNESS ON CORRUPTION USING THE AUGMENTED MEAN GROUP (AMG) METHOD WITH DATA FROM TURKEY AND SELECTED MENA COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2018. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT TRADE OPENNESS REDUCES CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, WHILE ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURES INCREASE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. IN ADDITION, DUMITRESCU-HURLIN'S (2012) CAUSALITY TEST FINDINGS REVEAL THE EXISTENCE OF DIFFERENT LINKAGES BETWEEN VARIABLES.
24	IN AMERICAN PUBLIC IMAGINATION, COURTS ARE POWERFUL BUT ALSO IMPOTENT. THEY ARE GUARDIANS OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS BUT ALSO AGENTS OF CORPORATE WEALTH; SIMULTANEOUSLY THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH AND THE ULTIMATE ARBITERS OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE. AFTER RECOUNTING THE SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE ON THE MIXED RECEPTION OF COURTS IN AMERICAN PUBLIC CULTURE, THIS ESSAY EXPLAINS HOW THE CONTRADICTORY EMBRACE OF COURTS AND LAW BY AMERICANS IS NOT A WEAKNESS OR FLAW, NOR A MARK OF CONFUSION OR NAIVETE. RATHER, AMERICANS' PARADOXICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF COURTS AND JUDGES SUSTAIN RATHER THAN UNDERMINE OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE OPPOSING ACCOUNTS ARE A SOURCE OF INSTITUTIONAL DURABILITY AND POWER BECAUSE THEY COMBINE THE HISTORICAL AND WIDESPREAD ASPIRATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW WITH A PRAGMATIC RECOGNITION OF THE LIMITS OF INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE; THESE SUNDRY ACCOUNTS BALANCE AN APPRECIATION FOR THE DISCIPLINE OF LEGAL REASONING WITH DESIRES FOR RESPONSIVE, HUMANE JUDGMENT.
25	MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION PREVENTS EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKERS AND THE VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, INCLUDING A FIRST-HAND ACCOUNT BY A MEXICAN STATE POLICE COMMANDER, THEN SUGGESTS HOW AND WHY AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY ESTABLISHING UNITED NATION (UN) INSPECTORS WHO ARE EMPOWERED TO INVESTIGATE CORRUPTION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN DETERRING CORRUPTION AND RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER REGION. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE ROME STATUTE PROVIDES A MODEL FOR ESTABLISHING THIS TYPE OF TREATY AND A PRECEDENT FOR ALL OF THE POWERS ENVISIONED FOR UN INSPECTORS, AND SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENT LEADERS MAY BE COMPELLED BY THEIR OWN CITIZENS TO SIGN AND RATIFY SUCH A TREATY IF IT IS POSED AS A PUBLIC LITMUS TEST OF THEIR LEADERS' WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.
26	THE LANGUAGE OF 'OWNERSHIP' IS COMMONLY USED IN STATEBUILDING OPERATIONS, BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THE TERM HAS EITHER CONSISTENCY OR SUBSTANCE. IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT HAVE ITS LITERAL MEANING, IN THE SENSE OF RIGHTS OF POSSESSION EITHER OF PROPERTY OR A FORMAL STAKE IN AN ORGANIZATION, SUCH AS SHARES IN A CORPORATION. INSTEAD OWNERSHIP TENDS TO BE USED FIGURATIVELY - MUCH AS 'BUY-IN' IN THIS CONTEXT USUALLY DOES NOT SUGGEST AN ACTUAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTION - TO REFER IN A MORE VAGUE WAY TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS, WITH MEANINGS RANGING FROM A SENSE OF ATTACHMENT TO A PROGRAMME OR OPERATION, TO (RARELY) ACTUAL CONTROLLING AUTHORITY. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES HOW OWNERSHIP EMERGED AS A SHIBBOLETH OF THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND HOW IT HAS INFLUENCED UN STATEBUILDING OPERATIONS. THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS, BUT THE CRITIQUE OF OWNERSHIP APPLIES TO POST-CONFLICT OPERATIONS MORE GENERALLY.
27	IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT DEBATES CONCERNING THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THIS PAPER PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS REGARDING THE NUCLEAR AND RENEWABLE ENERGY-ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXUS BY CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSING ON TEN NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMING COUNTRIES FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE PERIOD 2002-2021 REVEALED FEW RESULTS TO SUPPORT NEXT ENERGY POLICIES. THE FEEDBACK HYPOTHESIS IS CHECKED FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY, WHILE GROWTH HYPOTHESIS IS VALIDATED FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY CON-SUMPTION. THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON GROWTH BECOMES SIGNIFICANT WHEN THE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED IN THE PERIOD 2010-2021 WHEN NUCLEAR ENERGY CONSUMPTION HAS A LOW AND NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, WHILE AN EFFICIENT POLITICAL FRAMEWORK MIGHT MAKE THE NUCLEAR ENERGY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF GROWTH.
28	THE TOPICALITY OF THIS ARTICLE IS DUE TO THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE WORLD AND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE ROLE OF PUBLIC SERVICE AS A KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF A DEMOCRATIC, RULE OF LAW STATE. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONDUCT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODEL "JUDGE-PUBLIC SERVANT" IN UKRAINE AND THE WORLD. THE LEADING RESEARCH METHODS ARE METHODS OF LOGIC, ANALYSIS, COMPARISON AND MORE. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ARE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BASIC PROBLEMS OF FUNCTIONING OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE IN UKRAINE AND THE PROBLEMS OF DETERMINING THE LEGAL STATUS OF A JUDGE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT, AS WELL AS OUTLINING THE WAYS OF OVERCOMING PROBLEMS. THE STUDY MAY SERVE AS A BASIS FOR OUTLINING FUTURE CHANGES TO CURRENT LEGISLATION ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE IN UKRAINE AND THE LEGAL STATUS OF JUDGES.
29	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND MILITARY EXPENDITURE IN MODULATING THE EFFECT OF TERRORISM ON GOVERNANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IT IS BASED ON 53 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1998-2012 AND INTERACTIVE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS EMPLOYED. SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS FROM THE WORLD BANK AND TWO TERRORISM VARIABLES ARE USED, NAMELY, DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM DYNAMICS. FINDINGS THE FOLLOWING MAIN FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. THERE IS A NEGATIVE NET EFFECT ON GOVERNANCE (REGULATION QUALITY AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL) WHEN INCLUSIVE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS USED TO REDUCE TERRORISM. THERE IS A POSITIVE NET IMPACT ON GOVERNANCE (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW) WHEN MILITARY EXPENDITURE IS USED TO REDUCE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE AUTHORS HAVE COMPLEMENTED THE SPARSE LITERATURE ON THE USE OF POLICY VARIABLES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLICY SYNDROMES ON MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES.
30	THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT, UNDER MODERN INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE IMPOSITION OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IS ONLY ADMISSIBLE AS A MEASURE OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) SECURITY COUNCIL (MULTILATERAL) OR AS COUNTERMEASURE WHEN A STATE IS EITHER DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY ILLEGAL ACTS BY ANOTHER STATE, OR ACTS IN THE DEFENCE OF VITAL SECURITY INTERESTS UNDER THE "SECURITY EXCEPTIONS" OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT) (UNILATERAL). IN ALL OTHER CASES, UNILATERAL SANCTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR THEIR EXTRATERRITORIAL ENFORCEMENT, ARE A VIOLATION OF THE NORMS OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE PAPER ANALYZES THE NOTION OF COERCION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UN CHARTER, UNDERTAKES A STRUCTURAL COMPARISON BETWEEN MULTILATERAL AND UNILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIMES, AND ANALYZES THE POLITICAL USE OF UNILATERAL SANCTIONS AS A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW(2).
31	PARDONS ARE A WELL-KNOWN FORM OF LAWFUL BUT EXTRAJUDICIAL POWER OVER CRIMINAL CLASSIFICATIONS. THEY ARE STILL IN REGULAR USE IN RULE OF LAW REGIMES AROUND THE WORLD. ATTAINDER IS THE LESS WELL-KNOWN POWER TO CONDEMN VIA A LEGISLATIVE RATHER THAN A JUDICIAL ACT. DESPITE THEIR STRUCTURAL SIMILARITIES, PARDON AND ATTAINDER HAVE EXHIBITED DIVERGENT TRAJECTORIES. ONE IS UBIQUITOUS, THE OTHER EXTINCT. FOCUSING ON THE DIVERGENT TRAJECTORIES OF PARDON AND ATTAINDER DURING THE FRAMING OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND THEREAFTER, THE ARTICLE ADVANCES AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE PHENOMENA BASED ON ASYMMETRIES IN THE RELATIONAL FACTS LINKING PARDON AND ATTAINDER TO OTHER THICK MORAL CONSTRUCTS THAT CONSTITUTED THE MORAL SYSTEM OF THE FRAMERS AND THEIR SUCCESSORS. THOSE FACTS MATTERED IN THEIR OWN RIGHT, BUT IT WAS IN LIGHT OF THE MATRIX OF FOUNDING ERA MORAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT THE FRAMERS GRASPED AND INSTITUTIONALIZED THEIR SIGNIFICANCE.
32	SYSTEMATIC DATA ABOUT INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MODERN RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES AND MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. THIS ARTICLE UPDATES SUSAN FRANCK'S 'EMPIRICALLY EVALUATING CLAIMS ABOUT INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION' (2007) AND COMPLEMENTS THOMAS SCHULTZ AND CEDRIC DUPONT'S 'INVESTMENT ARBITRATION: PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW OR OVER-EMPOWERING INVESTORS? A QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL STUDY' (2015). I USE A POLITICAL SCIENCE LENS TO EXPLORE DATA ON THE MODERN INCARNATION OF ISDS, FROM 1990 TO 2014. THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES TOPICS INCLUDING: (I) THE INDUSTRY, NATIONALITY AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF ARBITRATION FILERS; (II) WIN, LOSS, SETTLEMENT AND ANNULMENT RATES; AND (III) TRENDS IN AMOUNTS CLAIMED AND AMOUNTS AWARDED. IT ALSO SERVES TO INTRODUCE THE ACCOMPANYING DATA SET. A CENTRAL TAKEAWAY IS THAT USERS OF THE DE FACTO ISDS REGIME ARE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE. NONETHELESS, BOTH PROPONENTS AND DETRACTORS OF ISDS MAY FIND FODDER FOR THEIR POSITIONS IN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.
33	THAILAND'S CURRENT CONFLICTS HAVE STRIKINGLY INCREASED POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, REDUCED LEGITIMACY OF GOVERNANCE, AND UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EXAMINE TYPES OF CONFLICTS IN 6 SOCIAL SITUATIONS IN THAILAND DURING 2013-14. A SAMPLE OF 1,200 CONFLICT NEWS REPORTS FROM 3 DAILY NEWSPAPERS, 2 WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS, AND 3 TELEVISION NEWS CHANNELS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS AND DISCOURSE ANALYSIS. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE CONFLICT NEWS REPORTED FROM THE DEEP SOUTHERN REGIONS OF THAILAND SHOWED MORE VIOLENT BEHAVIORS THAN THE OTHER FIVE CONFLICT SITUATIONS-THE POLITICAL CONFLICT, THE ECONOMIC CONFLICT, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONFLICT, THE PUBLIC POLICY, AND THE VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. ALL CONFLICT NEWS SHOWED HIGHER PROPORTION OF STRUCTURAL CONFLICTS RATHER THAN OTHER TYPES OF CONFLICT. MOREOVER, CONFLICT NEWS DURING THE 3 POLITICAL PERIODS SHOWED DIFFERENCES BASED ON WRITER'S BIASED OPINION AND PERSONAL IDEOLOGY.
34	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY IS FRAUGHT AND COMPLEX, AND NOWHERE MORE SO THAN IN IRAQ SINCE THE FALL OF SADDAM HUSSEIN. IRAQ HAS EXPERIENCED A RANGE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF ITS FORMER LEADER, PURGES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE AND THE MILITARY, AND A SERIES OF RECONCILIATION CONFERENCES. YET DEMOCRACY HAS NOT FULLY TAKEN ROOT AND VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO PLAGUE MANY PARTS OF THE NATION ON A REGULAR BASIS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT INITIATIVES AIMED AT CHANGING THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY - INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSTITUTIONALISM, FREQUENT ELECTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY - ARE MORE LIKELY THAN PURELY SYMBOLIC EFFORTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE LONG TERM. IT IS THESE STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM SOCIETY INTO A TRUE DEMOCRACY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
35	SINCE INDEPENDENCE, THE INDIAN STATE HAS SHOWN A VOLUNTARIST APPROACH IN THE JUDICIAL DOMAIN. THIS HAS LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SEVERE LAWS AGAINST CUSTOMARY RELATIONS OF EXPLOITATION, HARASSMENT, AND DISCRIMINATION THAT REST ON CASTE, GENDER, OR RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES. WHILE THIS POLICY HAS ENHANCED A DEEPER LEGAL CULTURE, AND PROVOKED A NEW LEGAL ACTIVISM WITHIN THE INDIAN POPULATION, IT HAS NOT EXTIRPATED THE LOCAL RELATIONS OF DOMINANCE AND EXPLOITATION. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF HOW THE RAPE OF A YOUNG GIRL FROM A LOWER CASTE IN HIMACHAL PRADESH (NORTHERN INDIA) WAS DEALT WITH IN THE JUDICIAL DOMAIN. IT WILL THUS PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TRADITIONAL POWER RELATIONS AND NEW FORCES THAT OPPOSE THOSE POWER RELATIONS THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW. IT WILL SHOW HOW THIS INTERPLAY IS VISIBLE IN TRIAL, AND HOW IT INTERFERES WITH CRIMINAL PROCEDURES FOLLOWED BY THE COURT.
36	VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) IS WIDELY ADOPTED BOTH BY FOREIGN INVESTORS TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE CHINESE MARKET AND BY CHINESE COMPANIES TO ACCESS OFFSHORE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO ITS LEGALITY HAS GENERATED ENDLESS SPECULATION, AND A RECENT PRC SUPREME COURT DECISION ON A SIMILAR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT HAS STIRRED ANOTHER ROUND OF DEBATE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES CHINA'S VIES IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA, FOCUSING ON BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RISK FACTORS SURROUNDING SUCH AN INVESTMENT STRUCTURE. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CURRENT LIMBO STATUS OF VIES EXEMPLIFIES THE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES FACED BY CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT MODEL, IE HOW TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEM AND BUILD A GENUINE-LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES AND FOREIGN INVESTORS IN CHINA. THE PROSPECTS OF VIES VERY MUCH DEPEND UPON HOW CHINA RESPONDS TO THESE INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES.
37	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON THE DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA BY EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF EFFECTIVE STATE-BUSINESS RELATIONS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR A PANEL OF 19 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1970-2004. WE PROPOSE A MEASURE THAT WE ARGUE CAPTURES THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF EFFECTIVE STATE-BUSINESS RELATIONS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. WE THEN ESTIMATE STANDARD GROWTH REGRESSIONS USING DYNAMIC PANEL DATA METHODS WITH THIS MEASURE, ALONG WITH THE MORE CONVENTIONALLY USED MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SUCH AS DEGREE OF EXECUTIVE CONSTRAINTS, THE RULE OF LAW, THE DEGREE OF CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF THE BUREAUCRACY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT EFFECTIVE STATE-BUSINESS RELATIONS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ECONOMIC GROWTH-COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENTS IN STATE-BUSINESS RELATIONS HAVE WITNESSED HIGHER ECONOMIC GROWTH, CONTROLLING FOR OTHER DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INDEPENDENT OF OTHER MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.
38	IT IS A PITY THAT THE PRICE OF PEACE, RESULTING FROM A PROLONGED TRANSATLANTIC DIALOGUE BETWEEN THEOLOGIANS AND ACADEMICS, SHOULD BEGIN WITH A FLAWED SECTION ON MODERN 'JUST WAR' THINKING WHICH FAILS TO RECOGNISE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN: 1. WAR BETWEEN STATES, IN WHICH, INTERNATIONAL LAW HAVING FAILED, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO RENDER THE ENEMY POWERLESS SO THAT THE VICTOR CAN DICTATE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT; AND 2. GLOBAL CRIMINALITY, AS IN THE TERRORISM OF GANGS LIKE AL- QAEDA, WHICH REQUIRES TO BE DEALT WITH BY A GLOBAL POLICE FORCE DESIGNED PRECISELY TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE SAKE OF THE COMMON GOOD OF ALL HUMANITY. PACE AUTHORS LIKE GEORGE WEIGEL, THINKING ABOUT THE JUSTICE OF ARMED FORCE CANNOT REMAIN WHAT IT WAS: IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP, AS THE PAPACY HAS LONG TAUGHT, TO TAKE FULL ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT CRIME IS TODAY REPLACING WAR AS THE PREVAILING INTERNATIONAL EVIL.
39	DEMOCRATIC ADVANTAGE (DA) ARGUMENTS EXPLICITLY AND IMPLICITLY ASSUME THAT DEMOCRACIES HAVE MORE TRANSPARENT PUBLIC DEBT, ENHANCING SOVEREIGN CREDITWORTHINESS. THIS STUDY QUESTIONS THE ASSUMED LINK BETWEEN TRANSPARENT PUBLIC DEBT PRACTICES AND DEMOCRACY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IT FINDS THAT SUCH PRACTICES, WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FOR INVESTORS, (A) DO NOT DEPEND ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND (B) LARGELY ERASE THE EFFECT THAT DA VARIABLES REGIME TYPE, RULE OF LAW, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS HAVE ON CREDITWORTHINESS. IN OTHER WORDS, TRANSPARENT PUBLIC DEBT AND DEMOCRACY SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO GO TOGETHER, AND TRANSPARENT DEBT PRACTICES AFFECT CREDITWORTHINESS MORE THAN DA VARIABLES. THE FINDINGS IDENTIFY PUBLIC DEBT TRANSPARENCY AS A STATISTICAL AND THEORETICAL CONFOUNDER FOR CURRENT ITERATIONS OF THE DA THESIS, WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND SOVEREIGN CREDITWORTHINESS. THE POLICY IMPLICATION IS TO NOT ASSUME THAT TRANSPARENT PUBLIC DEBT PRACTICES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO DEMOCRACIES.
40	AFRICA REMAINS THE MOST AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, THEREBY EXACERBATING THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE REGION. LITTLE EMPIRICAL CREDENCE HAS BEEN LEANED TO THE INSTITUTION-ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY RELATIONSHIP IN AFRICA. THIS OMISSION IN THE LITERATURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IS ABYSMAL, CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT IN ECOLOGICAL PRESERVATION. TO INFORM POLICY AND RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT MATTER, WE ESTIMATED A UNBALANCED PANEL DATA OF THE INDICES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS TO EXPLAIN TRANSFORMATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY USING THE DYNAMIC SYSTEM GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENT ESTIMATOR FROM 1996 THROUGH 2017. FINDINGS SUGGESTED A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY AND TRANSFORMATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WAS ESTABLISHED. WE RECOMMENDED CONCERTED EFFORT AT AN INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL SUCH THAT POLICY AND PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATION OF GREENHOUSE STRATEGIES WILL BE OPTIMUM.
41	LIBERALISM CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD IS LITTLE MORE THAN THE PERSISTENT AND CONSISTENT APPLICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS OF THE AFFAIRS OF MEN BE THEY DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL. THESE INCLUDE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL EXCHANGE, THE ABSENCE OF POLITICAL PRIVILEGE, AND TOLERATION. THE INSTITUTIONAL PRECONDITION OF THESE PRINCIPLES IS THE RULE OF LAW, PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND FREEDOM OF CONTRACT. SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM, HOWEVER, THE GAINS IN HUMAN PROGRESS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED FROM ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION ARE BEING INCREASINGLY QUESTIONED AND CRITIQUED. TO COUNTER THESE CRITICISMS OF LIBERALISM, I CONTEND, REQUIRES TIRELESS AND VARIED ITERATIONS OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET PROCESS FROM BEING CAPTURED BY THE VISIBLE HAND OF POLITICAL PRIVILEGE, POLITICAL ECONOMISTS MUST STRESS HOW THE CREATIVE POWERS OF A FREE CIVILIZATION ERODE POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND MONOPOLY PRIVILEGE THROUGH THE SPONTANEOUS ORDER OF MARKET PROCESS.
42	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE IN BRAZIL. THE ARTICLE BEGINS WITH A DISCUSSION ON THE COUNTRY'S PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF SOCIAL EQUALITY, VIOLENCE, AND WEAK ECONOMY AFTER THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN 1985. BASED ON HISTORICAL EVIDENCE, THE ARTICLE OFFERS EXPLANATIONS CONCERNING THE WEAK PERFORMANCE IN BRAZIL. THE CASE OF BRAZIL PROVIDES A CHALLENGE TO THE THEORY OF OPEN ACCESS ORDER OF NORTH AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE SENSE THAT OPEN ACCESS TO POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO EITHER BETTER POLITICAL REPRESENTATION OR BETTER ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THE CASE OF BRAZIL ALSO SHOWS THAT OPEN ACCESS TO ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIVITIES IN THE ABSENCE OF THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREAS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, THE FINANCIAL MARKET, THE RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RESOURCES ACCUMULATION DOES NOT LEAD TO LONG-TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH.
43	UNDER THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (THE TREATY) ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) WAS THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TRIBUNAL (THE TRIBUNAL). THE TRIBUNAL WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE SOLE JUDICIAL ORGAN OF SADC. THE TRIBUNAL WAS ESTABLISHED AS PART OF THE REORGANISATION OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION EFFORTS WITHIN SOUTHERN AFRICA. THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE PREVAILING AT THE TIME THE TRIBUNAL WAS ESTABLISHED, TOGETHER WITH THE LOFTY STATEMENTS IN THE SADC'S FOUNDING INSTRUMENTS, SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A REGIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE IDEALS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY AMONG SADC MEMBER STATES. THE TRIBUNAL'S LIFE, HOWEVER, WAS SHORT-LIVED. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE PROSPECTS AND LESSONS FOR REGIONAL INTEGRATION WITHIN THE SADC REGION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE DISBANDING OF THE TRIBUNAL AND ATTEMPTS TO DECIPHER THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DISBANDING FOR REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.
44	THIS PAPER FORMULATES A NEW PARADIGM, 'OFFICIALISM' (GUANBEN ZHUYI), AND USES IT TO ANALYSE CHINA'S TRADITIONAL SOCIETY. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT OFFICIALISM IS AN OFFICIAL BASED DOCTRINE AND A POLITICAL CULTURE AND SOCIO-POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH TAKES OFFICIAL POWER AND AUTHORITY AS ITS CORE ELEMENT. UNDER THIS CULTURE AND SYSTEM, RELATIONSHIPS OF OFFICIAL POWER AND AUTHORITY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THEY BECOME THE BASIC STANDARD FOR MEASURING A PERSON'S SOCIAL VALUE, AND THEY ARE THE DETERMINING FACTOR INFLUENCING A PERSON'S SOCIAL STATUS AND SOCIAL ATTRIBUTES. IN TRADITIONAL CHINA, MONARCHISM (JUNZHU ZHUYI) WAS THE HIGHEST FORM OF OFFICIALISM. DESPOTISM IS THE REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF OFFICIALISM. PEOPLE-BASED DOCTRINE (MINBEN ZHUYI) IS THE POLITICAL IDEAL THAT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF DESPOTISM. DEMOCRACY WITH THE RULE OF LAW IS THE ONLY WAY OF SMASHING OFFICIALISM AND OF SPURRING TRADITIONAL POLITICAL CIVILIZATION TO HEAD TOWARDS MODERN POLITICAL CIVILIZATION.
45	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW. ADDRESSED ARE THE STANDARDS APPLIED IN THE COMMISSION'S OPINIONS, ESPECIALLY ON CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND OTHER LEGAL NORMS OR DRAFTS. THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE IMPACT THAT THESE (NON-BINDING) OPINIONS HAVE ON THE STATES CONCERNED AS WELL AS ON THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THOUGH RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SOMETIMES DISREGARDED, MOST STATES DO REACT POSITIVELY, AT LEAST IN PART. TO SOME EXTENT THE COMMISSION COULD ENHANCE THE EFFECT OF ITS OPINIONS BY JOINING FORCES WITH OTHER RELEVANT INSTITUTIONS IN THE FIELD, ESPECIALLY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. ENDORSING AND IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS GIVES STATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE IN THE REPUTATION THAT COMES WITH BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY FOUNDED ON HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRACY. AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT IS MADE OF THE COMMISSION'S APPROACH TO ITS WORK.
46	IN RECENT DECADES, THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS RESIDING IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY. THEIR NEBULOUS PRESENCE UNDERMINES STATES' ABILITY TO EXERT CONTROL OVER THEIR POPULATIONS AND TERRITORIES. IN RESPONSE, MOST HOST STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED LARGE-SCALE REGULARIZATIONS TO LEGALIZE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS' STATUS. YET WE POSSESS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT THESE POLICIES EXERT ON THE STATES THEMSELVES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IMMIGRANT REGULARIZATION, STATE CAPACITY, AND SOVEREIGNTY. I ARGUE THAT REGULARIZATIONS REVEAL A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN POPULAR IMAGES OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND A STATE'S ACTUAL CAPACITY TO WIELD AUTHORITY. ON ONE HAND, REGULARIZATIONS FACILITATE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION, ENHANCING TAXATION CAPACITY, IMMIGRATION CONTROL, AND THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER, BY IMPLEMENTING THESE POLICIES, STATES CONCURRENTLY DEMONSTRATE AN INABILITY TO REGULATE MIGRATION AND PUNISH TRANSGRESSORS, THEREBY UNDERMINING PERCEPTIONS OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY. THUS REGULARIZATIONS CAN TRANSFORM STATES BY REVEALING THE TENSION BETWEEN IDEAL IMAGES AND CONCRETE PRACTICES.
47	HISTORICALLY, REPUBLICANS WERE OF DIFFERENT MINDS ABOUT MARKETS: SOME, SUCH AS ROUSSEAU, REVILED THEM, WHILE OTHERS, LIKE ADAM SMITH, PRAISED THEM. THE RECENT REPUBLICAN RESURGENCE HAS REVIVED THIS ISSUE. CLASSICAL LIBERALS SUCH AS GERALD GAUS CONTEND THAT NEOREPUBLICANISM IS INHERENTLY HOSTILE TO MARKETS, WHILE NEOREPUBLICANS LIKE RICHARD DAGGER AND PHILIP PETTIT REJECT THIS CHARACTERIZATION-THOUGH WITH LESS ENTHUSIASM THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT. I ARGUE HERE THAT THE RIGHT REPUBLICAN ATTITUDE TOWARD COMPETITIVE MARKETS IS CELEBRATORY RATHER THAN ACQUIESCENT AND THAT REPUBLICANISM DEMANDS SUCH MARKETS FOR THE SAME REASON IT REQUIRES THE RULE OF LAW: BECAUSE BOTH ARE ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PROTECTING INDIVIDUALS FROM ARBITRARY INTERFERENCE. I REVEAL HOW COMPETITION RESTRAINS-AND IN THE LIMIT, EVEN ERADICATES-MARKET POWER AND THEREBY HELPS US REALIZE "MARKET FREEDOM," I.E., FREEDOM AS NONDOMINATION IN THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC EXCHANGE. FINALLY, I SHOW THAT SUCH FREEDOM NECESSITATES "ANGLO-NORDIC" ECONOMIC POLICIES.
48	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF THE STATE IN UKRAINE FROM AN OBJECT OF ELITE PREDATION IN EARLY 1990S INTO A DOMINANT ACTOR IN RELATIONS WITH NON-STATE ACTORS UNDER KUCHMA, AN INSTRUMENT OF ELITE STRUGGLES FOR POWER AND RENTS UNDER YUSHCHENKO AND A RETURN TO A CENTRALIZED STATE AUTHORITY UNDER YANUKOVYCH. DESPITE ITS DIFFERENT TRANSFORMATIONS THE STATE IN UKRAINE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE PREVALENCE OF INFORMAL LEVERS OF POWER AND THE ABSENCE OF STRONG FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS. AS A RESULT, AFTER TWENTY YEARS IT STILL LACKS THE PREREQUISITES OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN A MODERN STATE - AN IMPERSONAL BUREAUCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND MECHANISMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS INSTITUTIONAL VOID PRODUCES UKRAINE'S VICIOUS CYCLING BETWEEN HYBRID TYPES OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND DEMOCRACY LEAVING THE STATE DYSFUNCTIONAL AND INCOMPLETE.

49	'PUBLIC INTEREST' (SYNONYMOUS HERE WITH 'COMMON GOOD' AND 'PUBLIC GOOD') IS A CENTRAL CONCEPT IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. IN AN IMPORTANT, BASIC SENSE, WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENTS IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEIR POLICIES ARE DETRIMENTAL TO, OR BENEFIT, PUBLIC INTEREST. HOWEVER THERE ARE PROBLEMS OPERATIONALIZING PUBLIC INTEREST: IT SEEMS A CONCEPT THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY INDISPENSABLE YET VAGUE. WHILE DIFFICULTIES OPERATIONALIZING PUBLIC INTEREST ARE WIDELY UNDERSTOOD, A FURTHER PROBLEM IS INSUFFICIENTLY ACKNOWLEDGED. THIS IS THAT MANY FEATURES UNDERPINNING PUBLIC INTEREST (A TRADITION OF CITIZENSHIP, STABLE GOVERNMENT, A RULE OF LAW, BASIC INFRASTRUCTURES) ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES. HOWEVER, IN OTHER CONTEXTS WE CANNOT ASSUME THESE. EXAMINING WHAT PUBLIC INTEREST MEANS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CAN BE USEFUL TO IDENTIFY THESE TAKEN FOR GRANTED ASSUMPTIONS, AND TO RE-EXAMINE THIS UBIQUITOUS AND ENDURING CONCEPT. WE DO THIS THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF LAND RIGHTS REFORM IN POST CONFLICT NICARAGUA.
50	SINCE CHINA IS NOW IN A STAGE OF SOCIAL TRANSITION THAT DISPLAYS A HIGH OCCURRENCE OF SOCIAL CONFLICT AND INTEREST DISPUTES, STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ENSURING THE CORRECT EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER IS THE BEST STRATEGY FOR PREVENTING, REDUCING AND PROPERLY MANAGING SOCIAL RISKS. STRUCTURAL DEFECTS HAVE MEANT THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC PROSECUTION HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN FULL REIN. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SHOULD THUS BECOME AN IMPORTANT OPTION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT WOULD HAVE VALUE IN A MULTITUDE OF WAYS, INCLUDING MONITORING AND PROMOTING THE EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ACCORDING TO LAW, GUIDING THE CREATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, AND RESOLVING SOCIAL CONFLICTS, AND IT IS ALSO A NECESSITY FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF CHINA'S PROCURATORIAL SYSTEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SHOULD BE DESIGNED AT THE CONCEPTUAL LEVEL, THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, AND SO ON.
51	FOR BOTH ARISTOTLE AND HEGEL, THE FAMILY IS THE FOUNDATION IN WHICH THE UNIVERSALIZED RULE OF LAW IS VALIDATED ACCORDING TO THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF THE "POLIS" OR "STATE" ITSELF. THIS COMPOSITE WHOLE OR STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY (ANCIENT POLIS/MODERN STATE) IS THE POLITICAL END OF HUMANITY FOR BOTH PHILOSOPHERS, WHICH IN TURN FINDS ITS PRIMORDIAL BEGINNING IN THE FAMILY. FOR ARISTOTLE, IT IS IN THE KINGLY RULE OF THE HOUSEHOLD THAT THE PROPERTY-BASED DISTINCTION OF CITIZENSHIP IS SET FOR THE RULE OF HIS IDEAL POLIS. FOR HEGEL, IT IS IN THE LOVE AFFIRMED THROUGH CARING AFFECTION WITHIN THE NUCLEAR FAMILY THAT THE DIALECTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THE RATIONAL UNITY OF A CONGREGATIONAL "SPIRIT" IN THE STATE, FINDS ITS FOUNDATION. FOR BOTH THINKERS, THE FAMILY SETS THE BASE FOR A POLITICAL THEORY THAT DEFINES CITIZENSHIP IN A MANNER THAT TRANSCENDS THE PARTICULARITIES OF KIN BONDS.
52	THIS WORK AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE MULTI-DRUG RESISTANCE (MDR) PERCENTAGE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA IN EUROPE, THROUGH MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING VALIDATION, USING DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND THE WORLD BANK. WE RAN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND USED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO VALIDATE A POOLING PANEL DATA CASE. THE RESULTS OF OUR ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLES EXPLAINING THE MDR PHENOMENA ACROSS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES, SUCH AS CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE MODELS PROPOSED IN THIS STUDY SHOWED THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS RESISTANCE PROBLEM. THE EFFORTS CONTROLLING MDR P. AERUGINOSA, AS A WELL-KNOWN HEALTHCARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTION (HCAI), SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON SOLVING NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS THAT IMPACT RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION, IN ADDITION TO INDIVIDUAL GUIDELINES, SUCH AS PROMOTING THE APPROPRIATE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS.
53	THE STUDY ASSESSES THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE IN MODULATING THE EFFECT OF OIL WEALTH ON WEALTH INEQUALITY IN 45 DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE SYSTEM GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT OIL RENTS UNCONDITIONALLY INCREASE WEALTH INEQUALITY WHILE GOVENANCE DYANMICS (IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION-CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY) MODERATE OIL RENTS FOR AN OVERALL NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON WEALTH INEQUALITY. GOOD GOVERNANCE THRESHOLDS AT WHICH THE UNCONDITIONAL OR NON-INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF OIL RENTS ON THE WEALTH INEQUALITY CHANGES FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE ARE COMPUTED AND DISCUSSED. IT FOLLOWS THAT WHILE GOVERNANCE IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR IMPROVING THE REDISTRIBUTIVE EFFECTS OF OIL WEALTH, IT BECOMES A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR NET POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN WEALTH DISTRIBUTION ONLY WHEN SOME CRITICAL LEVELS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE HAVE BEEN REACHED. OTHER POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
54	THE NEXT GENERATION EU (NGEU) AND THE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE FACILITY (RRF) ENCOMPASSED THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER. TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY THIS HAPPENED WE APPLY DIFFERENT THEORETICAL APPROACHES SO AS TO EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS PROCESS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THIS COLLECTION DISCUSS THREE MAIN QUESTIONS: (1) IS THE SEMESTER SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE DOMESTIC ARENA? (2) DO DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE SUCCESS (OR LACK THEREOF) OF THE SEMESTER? (3) WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN FROM PAST ECONOMIC POLICY COORDINATION FOR THE CHALLENGES AHEAD? IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS, ONE'S LENS NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED AT BOTH THE EU AND THE DOMESTIC LEVELS. VARIOUS FACTORS PLAY A ROLE: SOLIDARITY, MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, RELATIONS BETWEEN THE 'SOUTH' AND THE 'NORTH', QUESTIONS ABOUT DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES, AND EVEN THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS (THE GREEN DEAL).
55	IN HIGHWOOD CONGREGATION OF JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES V WALL, THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DEFINED THE BOUNDARIES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ON THE BASIS OF A PUBLIC/PRIVATE DISTINCTION. THIS DECISION ATTRACTED CRITICISM, NOTABLY FOR ITS AMBIGUITY WITH REGARD TO THE REVIEW OF INSTITUTIONS AT THE MARGINS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE IMPACT OF WALL IN THE THREE YEARS SINCE THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA ISSUED ITS DECISION. IT SHOWS THAT SOME CRITICISMS OF THE DECISION WERE WARRANTED. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT LOWER COURTS HAVE OVERCOME SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF WALL BY RELYING ON THE MULTI-FACTOR TEST SET OUT BY THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL IN AIR CANADA V TORONTO PORT AUTHORITY ET AL. NEVERTHELESS, WALLS' IMPOSITION OF A STRICT PUBLIC/PRIVATE DISTINCTION AT TIMES APPEARS TO BE IN TENSION WITH ITS STATED PURPOSE OF ENSURING THAT JUDICIAL REVIEW RESPONDS TO RULE OF LAW CONCERNS.
56	SINCE THE EARLY 1980S A WAVE OF LIBERALIZING REFORMS HAS SWEPT OVER THE WORLD. USING PANEL DATA FROM 30 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD 1993-2015, WE TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SUCH REFORMS HAVE LED TO VOTER DISSATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY, SINCE, IT IS ARGUED, THEY HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN A NON-TRANSPARENT WAY, OFTEN DURING CRISES, AND THEY HAVE ENTAILED DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. THE REFORM MEASURES ARE CONSTRUCTED AS DISTINCT CHANGES IN FOUR POLICY/INSTITUTIONAL AREAS: GOVERNMENT SIZE, THE RULE OF LAW, MARKET OPENNESS, AND REGULATION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT WHILE REFORMS OF GOVERNMENT SIZE ARE NOT ROBUSTLY RELATED TO SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY, REFORMS OF THE OTHER THREE KINDS ARE - AND IN A WAY THAT RUNS COUNTER TO ANTI-LIBERALIZATION CLAIMS. REFORMS THAT REDUCE ECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE GENERALLY RELATED TO SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY IN A NEGATIVE WAY, WHILE REFORMS THAT INCREASE ECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY WITH SATISFACTION WITH DEMOCRACY.
57	RATHER THAN HALTING EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, THE EURO CRISIS, IN SOME WAYS, HAS ACCELERATED IT. HOWEVER, IT IS INTEGRATION OF A DIFFERENT TYPE, WHICH DEPARTS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RULE OF LAW-BASED MODEL OF INTEGRATION THAT TRADITIONALLY BURNISHED THE EUROPEAN UNION'S LEGITIMACY. THE CRISIS-INDUCED TRANSFORMATION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) CAPTURES THIS TREND. THROUGH SCHEMES SUCH AS OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONS, THE BANK BOLSTERED ITS CAPACITY TO STABILIZE THE EURO WITHOUT HAVING ITS MANDATE FORMALLY ENLARGED, THUS CONFIRMING THE ASCENDENCY OF TECHNOCRATIC, AND OFTEN AD HOC, GOVERNANCE OVER DEMOCRATICALLY AND LEGALLY CIRCUMSCRIBED ALTERNATIVES. THIS ARTICLE POSITS THE ECB'S EXPANDED AND POLITICIZED ROLE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF A NEW MODE OF INTEGRATION - INTEGRATION THROUGH THE DISINTEGRATION OF LAW - WHICH INVERTS THE COURT-DRIVEN INTEGRATION-THROUGH-LAW THAT CONSOLIDATED THE SINGLE MARKET. HOWEVER, THE LACK OF A SOLID LEGITIMACY BASE CASTS DOUBT ON THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS INTEGRATION MODE.
58	DEMOCRATIC ORGANISATIONS AND ELECTED COUNCILS ARE VITAL TO EMBODY THE DEMOCRATIC REGIMES SHAPED BY THE "RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE" OF THE MODERN TIMES. THE INITIAL TRACES OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE CAN BE FOUND IN THE MOMENTS WHEN THE ELECTED ORGANS AND ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES STARTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE. SUCH ORGANISATIONS AND COUNCILS HAVE STARTED TO EMERGE DURING THE MODERNIZATION PERIODS SUCH AS THE TANZIMAT ERA IN THE LAST CENTURY OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURING. WHEN CONSIDERED FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, MODERNIZATION OF OTTOMAN ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT ONLY A MOVEMENT INITIATED AND HANDLED BY THE CENTRAL AUTHORITY, BUT A TIME PERIOD WHERE THE ORGANISATIONS AND COUNCILS WERE THE DETERMINANTS SHAPED BY THE GENUINE CONDITIONS OF THE PERIPHERY. THESE REFORMIST AND REPRESENTATIVE STRUCTURES WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT MILESTONES OF THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS UNTIL THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TURKISH REPUBLIC.
59	IN RECENT TIMES, CHINA'S LEADERSHIP ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF LEGAL REFORMS TO MODERNIZE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND TO INCREASE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE ACTION OCCURRED IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING FRUSTRATION OVER THE LACK OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN JUDICIAL LEADERSHIP, AND THE UNSYSTEMATIC ORGANIZATION OF THE COURTS. IN LOOKING BACK ON NEW YORK'S HISTORY OF COURT REFORM AND MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A COURT ADMINISTRATOR FOR MANY DECADES, I ARGUE THAT NEW YORK'S EXPERIENCE WITH REORGANIZING AND STRENGTHENING THE JUDICIARY AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE SOME ILLUMINATION AND LESSONS LEARNED TO CHINESE COURT REFORMERS. IN EMBRACING A UNIFIED COURT SYSTEM SEPARATE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES AND STRENGTHENING AND SUPPORTING THE JUDICIARY, NEW YORK ENTERED THE MODERN ERA, AND THE NEW YORK EXPERIENCE CAN IMPART SOME USEFUL INSTRUCTION TO CHINA AS IT UNDERGOES A SIMILAR TRANSFORMATION.
60	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER GOVERNANCE MATTERS FOR THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, EMPIRICALLY CAPTURED WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK USING THE PANEL DATA ESTIMATION PROCEDURE. IN DOING SO, IT TESTS THE EFFECT OF SEVERAL DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE ON THE GROWTH OF 84 LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES USING REGRESSION SPECIFICATIONS COMMON IN THE GROWTH LITERATURE. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT POLITICAL STABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH GROWTH. VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRUPTION ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH GROWTH. THE REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE ARE NEGATIVELY BUT STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH GROWTH. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY IMPLY THAT THE DYNAMICS OF THE CURRENT MODERN ECONOMY MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO ACT NOW AND WITHIN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, IMPROVE THE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND ESTABLISH GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES THAT ARE DOMESTICALLY RELEVANT AND INTERNATIONALLY COMPARABLE AND CONSISTENT.
61	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE IMPORTANCE AND DIFFICULTY OF IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES, STANDARDS, AND NORMS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM ABUSE BY STATE INSTITUTIONS. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE IN MAINTAINING ORDER AND IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW IS ACKNOWLEDGED. THIS IS THEN EXTENDED TO ONE OF THE STATE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF PUBLIC ORDER. THE POLICE. POLICE COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS IS IMPERATIVE IF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TO BE PROTECTED. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHAT POLICE COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS COULD ENTAIL. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A LOOK AT THE ROLE OF THE POLICE IN SOCIETY AND THE SOCIETAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REALITIES THAT IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICE HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGIES IN LATIN AMERICA. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STRATEGIES HAVE SPARKED DEBATES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, INEQUALITY, SECURITY, AND THE HURDLES TO POLICE REFORM IN LATIN AMERICA.
62	WILL DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES EVER BE THE SAME AFTER COVID-19? BY IDENTIFYING COMMON TRENDS AND ISSUES IN LEGAL RESPONSES TO COVID-19 AT THE COMPARATIVE LEVEL, THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO ANSWER THIS CRUCIAL QUESTION BY ANALYZING THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC. IN PARTICULAR, THIS WORK EXAMINES WHETHER (AND HOW) INSTITUTIONAL DISRUPTIONS, NEW DYNAMICS AMONG GOVERNMENT LEVELS, AND SERIOUS LIMITATIONS OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WILL PERMANENTLY AFFECT SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES, CONSIDERED AS THE "COMMON" FOUNDATIONS OF CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE THE HORIZONTAL SEPARATION OF POWERS, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, VERTICAL SEPARATION OF POWERS, ENTAILING LEGAL CERTAINTY, AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEWABILITY, AT THE HEART OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE CLAIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT COVID-19 WAS A "GAME-CHANGER" FOR PUBLIC LAW AND, AT THE SAME TIME, IT TAUGHT US SOME LESSONS THAT COULD BE USEFUL TO TACKLE FORTHCOMING GLOBAL EMERGENCIES.
63	ALTHOUGH THE PLACE OF EU CRIMINAL LAW IN THE EUROPEAN CONSTRUCTION HAS BECOME INCONTESTABLE TODAY, IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A FAR FROM OBVIOUS ONE. IN ITS ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT, TWO DIFFERENT RATIONALES CAN BE DISTINGUISHED: A FUNCTIONAL ONE AIMED AT USING CRIMINAL LAW INSTRUMENTS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC CROSS-BORDER CRIME CHALLENGES GENERATED OR ENHANCED BY THE PROGRESS OF EU INTEGRATION IN OTHER FIELDS, AND A CONSTITUTIONAL ONE IMPLYING THE USE OF CRIMINAL LAW ALSO TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE RESPECT AND PROMOTION OF EU COMMON VALUES. WHILE THE FIRST RATIONALE HAS BEEN DOMINANT FROM THE OUTSET, THE SECOND HAS EMERGED ONLY GRADUALLY. FOR THE SAKE OF EFFECTIVENESS, LEGITIMACY AND MUTUAL TRUST, BOTH RATIONALES SHOULD EQUALLY DRIVE THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF EU CRIMINAL LAW. YET PROSPECTS FOR A STRONGER AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RATIONALE ARE WEAKENED BY CURRENT EU RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES.
64	THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF JUNE 22, VENEZUELA/COUNCIL, OPENS A NEW DIMENSION IN RELATION TO THE SCOPE OF THE ADMISSIBILITY CRITERIA OF ART. 263 TFEU, FOURTH PARAGRAPH. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COURT HAS CONSIDERED THAT VENEZUELA, A THIRD STATE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A "LEGAL PERSON" AND THEREFORE IS ENTITLED - IF THE OTHER ADMISSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE MET - TO FILE AN APPEAL FOR ANNULMENT AGAINST RESTRICTIVE MEASURES DIRECTED AGAINST IT. ACCORDING TO THE COURT, THIS INTERPRETATION IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST OF THIS MATTER ALSO LIES IN THE ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE SCOPE OF PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW SUCH AS RECIPROCITY AND SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. FINALLY, THE RULING OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE CHOICE AND ADOPTION OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES BY THE EU.
65	SINCE STARTING ITS ECONOMIC REFORM FOUR DECADES AGO, CHINA HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN INTEGRATING ITS ECONOMY INTO REGIONAL AND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS). THIS STARTED WITH SIMPLE ASSEMBLY AND PROCESSING, THEN EXPANDED TO LOW-END LABOR-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING, AND GRADUALLY MOVED UP TO TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE AND CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE LAW, LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, AND INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF GVCS, WHICH WE DIVIDE INTO FIVE PHASES. THE ARTICLE DOES NOT IDEALIZE LAW IN TERMS OF 'COMMITMENT' OR 'RULE OF LAW,' BUT RATHER, IN THE LEGAL REALIST TRADITION, VIEWS LAW AS AN IMPORTANT, CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN ECONOMIC CHANGE. IT PRESENTS LAW AS A SIGNALLING AND COORDINATIVE DEVICE THAT SERVES TO CHANNEL PRIVATE CONDUCT FOR BUSINESS PLANNING AND COORDINATION. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES INSIGHTS FOR UNDERSTANDING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TRADING SYSTEM AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIONAL AND GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS.
66	IN THE LAST DECADE, A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE HAS INVESTIGATED THE PROMOTION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA THROUGH FUNDING FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). MOST OF THIS RESEARCH HAS TAKEN AN EU-CENTRIC APPROACH AND IS CONCERNED WITH THE SUPPLY SIDE OF EXTERNAL DEMOCRATIZATION. AS A RESULT, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW EU PROJECTS ARE IMPLEMENTED ON THE GROUND AND WHAT EU-FUNDED CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS CONSIDER TO BE THEIR PRIORITIES. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE AGENCY OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS IN KYRGYZSTAN BY FOCUSING ON THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ONE PARTICULAR EU INSTRUMENT: THE INSTRUMENT CONTRIBUTING TO STABILITY AND PEACE (ICSP), AND ITS PROGRAMME: STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE TO VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM (STRIVE). THE FINDINGS OFFER NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE PROCESSES OF ADAPTATION, REINTERPRETATION AND CONTESTATION THROUGH WHICH EU-FUNDED ORGANIZATIONS EXERCISE OWNERSHIP WHILE ENGAGING IN THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM (PVE).
67	IN THIS ESSAY, WE DESCRIBE THE OVERLAPPING PHENOMENA OF NEW LEGAL HUBS (NLHS), INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL COURTS, AND ARBITRAL COURTS. WE SURVEY THEIR IMPACT ON THE LAW AND GEOPOLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION, IDENTIFYING KEY ISSUES THESE NEW DISPUTE RESOLUTION INSTITUTIONS RAISE. WHILE THE RISE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL COURTS SPANS AUTHORITARIAN AND LIBERAL STATES, WESTERN AND ASIAN STATES, COMMON LAW AND CIVIL LAW TRADITIONS, IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS AND BUILDS UPON REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. WE QUESTION THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COURTS IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITH AN INCREASE IN THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY IN NON-DEMOCRATIC STATES. WE CLOSE WITH THOUGHTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE AND FUTURE ROLE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. SOME OF THE PROCEDURAL INNOVATIONS DISCUSSED HERE MAY LEAD TO SHIFTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR YEARS TO COME, BUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND FOR THESE NEW INSTITUTIONS LINGERS.
68	AS IT IS KNOWN, EXPORT IS A POSITIVE ECONOMIC PHENOMENON THAT IS DESIRED TO BE REALIZED FOR ALL COUNTRIES. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE ON EXPORT WAS INVESTIGATED IN 36 OECD COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2002-2018. FOUR DIFFERENT MODELS WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDY AND EXPORT WAS DEFINED AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN ALL MODELS. IN THE FIRST MODEL IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND EXPORT. IN THE SECOND MODEL IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REGULATORY QUALITY AND EXPORT. IN THE THIRD MODEL IT IS OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL STABILITY AND EXPORTS. IN THE FOURTH MODEL THAT INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON EXPORTS THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RELEVANT VARIABLES.
69	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE THE CHALLENGES AND APPROACHES OF ACCEPTANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME (UNTOC) AND THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (UNCAC) IN CHINA AND TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICE OF INTERNATIONAL ANTICORRUPTION COOPERATION. THE CHALLENGES OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNTOC AND THE UNCAC MAINLY COMPRISE POLITICAL, NATIONAL INTEREST AND ANTICORRUPTION STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS. MEANWHILE, THE CHALLENGES FOR THE ACCEPTANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE TWO INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS INVOLVE NOT ONLY GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW CONSIDERATIONS BUT ALSO THE NEED TO INTEGRATE THEM DOMESTICALLY INTO THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM. CRIMINAL LAW IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LAWS USED IN ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS: AS SOCIETY HAS DEVELOPED, THE SCOPE OF CORRUPTION CRIME HAS CORRESPONDINGLY EXPANDED. IN RECENT YEARS, BECAUSE OF THESE TWO IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS, CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION HAS RESULTED IN SOME PRACTICABLE ACHIEVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET RECOVERY.
70	THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE BIPOLAR WORLD ORDER CAUSED A LOT OF CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN STATES IN THE FORMATION OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ORDER. ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TASKS FACING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS THE NEED TO INCREASE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC LIFE. SOLVING GLOBAL PROBLEMS REQUIRES INCREASING THE LEVEL OF CONTROLLABILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. AWARENESS OF THIS TASK IS GRADUALLY REFLECTED IN POLITICAL THINKING. ITS RELEVANCE IS EMPHASIZED IN THE ACTS OF BOTH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND STATES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE REALITIES OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION, WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF INCREASING THE LEVEL OF CONTROL IS SLOWER THAN IS REQUIRED AT THE PRESENT STAGE. THE CONCEPT AND LEGAL NATURE OF THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNATIONALLY WRONGFUL ACTS.
71	CONTEMPORARY RATES OF INCARCERATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN AUSTRALIA ARE GENERALLY SEEN AS QUITE RECENT IN ORIGIN, AN UNWANTED OUTCOME OF THE EMERGENCE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE INTO FULL CITIZENSHIP FROM THE 1960S. YET FOR ONLY RELATIVELY SHORT PERIODS WERE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA EXCLUDED FROM THE FULL IMPLICATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ITS MODE OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION; FOR THE MOST PART, THEY WERE CONSIDERED BRITISH SUBJECTS. HAVING BEEN BROUGHT INTO CRIMINAL JURISDICTION HOW DID THEY FARE? WHILE MUCH CAN BE LEARNED FROM ARCHIVAL RESEARCH AT THE CASE LEVEL, WE PROPOSE HERE THAT QUALITATIVE STUDIES ARE BEST EXAMINED IN QUANTITATIVE CONTEXT. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE FIRST EVER QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN HOMICIDE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, WE CONSIDER HOW CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORKED FOR INDIGENOUS AND NON-INDIGENOUS DEFENDANTS, IDENTIFYING HOW MANY DEFENDANTS IN EACH GROUP WERE PROSECUTED, AND THEIR VARYING TREATMENT AT TRIAL PROCESS, OUTCOME AND SENTENCE.
72	THE DEVELOPMENT OF MARITIME LAW AND POLICY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS FOR NATION STATES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF GLOBALISATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF MARITIME RIGHTS AND INTERESTS AND THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE REALISED THROUGH EFFECTIVE, REASONABLE AND EQUITABLE LEGAL SYSTEMS, WITHIN WHICH BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW CAN BE UTILISED TO DEAL WITH THE WIDE RANGE OF MARINE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES. IN OCTOBER 2013, SHANDONG UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW ORGANISED WITH THE SUPPORT OF ZHONGCHENG RENHE LAW FIRM THE "2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE" TO BRING TOGETHER ACADEMICS, POLICY MAKERS AND MARITIME LAW PRACTITIONERS TO EXAMINE DEVELOPMENTS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS IN THIS FIELD OF RESEARCH. WE PROVIDE A BRIEF REPORT OF THE KEY ISSUES DISCUSSED DURING THE WORKSHOP WHICH MAY ASSIST IN DEVELOPING BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE APPROACHES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES.
73	THE PROLIFERATION OF ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS IN RECENT YEARS, PARTICULARLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE OECD ANTI-BRIBERY CONVENTION, SENDS A FIRM SIGNAL TO COMPANIES THAT NORMS CONCERNING CORRUPTION IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS HAVE CHANGED. WITH THE INCREASE IN LEGAL RISK HAS COME AN INCREASE IN REPUTATIONAL RISK. HOWEVER, THESE LAWS AND THE CULTURES OF ENFORCEMENT AROUND THEM, SEND CONFLICTING MESSAGES ABOUT BRIBERY BEING AVOIDABLE OR INDEED UNETHICAL. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY LAWS INCLUDE AN EXEMPTION OR A DEFENCE FOR FACILITATION PAYMENTS IMPLYING THAT SUCH BRIBES ARE LESS UNETHICAL OR THAT FIRMS HAVE A WEAKER RESPONSIBILITY TO AVOID PAYING THEM, THAN IS THE CASE FOR BRIBES 'TO GAIN A BUSINESS ADVANTAGE'. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ANALYSE WHETHER THIS DISTINCTION HAS A BASIS IN ETHICS. IT SUGGESTS THAT SOME BRIBES ARE LESS HARMFUL THAN OTHERS IN TERMS OF THEIR DIRECT IMPACT. HOWEVER, ALL BRIBES ARE HARMFUL, BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW.
74	IN THIS ARTICLE, I SHOW HOW THE FRAMEWORK OF EMPIRE REMAINS CENTRAL FOR ANALYZING CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. MOVING BEYOND CRITICISMS ABOUT THE DOMINATION OF GLOBAL SOUTH POLITIES BY THE WEST, OR BY A TRANSNATIONAL CAPITALIST CLASS, I SUGGEST INSTEAD THAT `EMPIRE' CAN HELP US ANALYZE THE PROTOCOLS OF REASONING IN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATIONS. THROUGH A CLOSE READING OF SCHOLARSHIP ON THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE (FET) CLAUSE, AND A RECENT ARBITRAL AWARD ARISING OUT AN FET CLAIM, I SHOW THAT THE FIELD IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN IMPERIAL MODE OF LEGAL REASONING. THIS MODE WAS REASON WAS PRODUCED BY A FOUNDATIONAL DISTRUST OF POSTCOLONIAL DEVELOPMENTAL STATES. IT INVOLVES JUDGING CONCRETE STATE ACTION AGAINST A FICTIONAL UNIVERSAL BASELINE THAT REPRESENTS THE ORDOLIBERAL UTOPIA OF AN AUSTERE RULE OF LAW BOUND STATE. CRUCIALLY, IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT, THIS FORM OF REASONING REMAINS DISCERNIBLE EVEN WHEN FOREIGN INVESTORS DO NOT SUCCEED.
75	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF TWO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS ON CONSUMER MICRO-LOANS IN POLAND RECENTLY CONDUCTED AT THE INSTITUTE OF APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCES (UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW) AND THE INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE. THE TEXT SUMMARIZES THE MAIN FINDINGS OF BOTH STUDIES AND FOCUSES ON THEIR MAIN COMMON THREAD: THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AMONG AVERAGE CONSUMERS WHO ENTER THE LOAN MARKET. THE TEXT ARGUES THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE CONSUMER LOANS USUALLY EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL EXCLUSION, WHICH IN TURN PREVENTS THEM FROM OBTAINING THE CHEAPER CREDIT AVAILABLE FROM BANKS. AT THE SAME TIME, BY ENTERING THE LOAN MARKET INDIVIDUALS DE FACTO EXCLUDE THEMSELVES FROM EFFECTIVE LEGAL PROTECTION (FROM COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES), WHICH SHOULD BE PROVIDED AS AN ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE. BUILDING ON THESE PREMISES, THE CONCEPT OF "CASCADE EXCLUSION" IS PROPOSED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THESES ON INTERRELATED DIMENSIONS OF EXCLUSION.
76	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING THE BNCC IN REFERENCE TO THE WIDER POLITICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS PROCESS IS BEING GESTATED, THE VARIOUS VOICES THAT IT IS EXPRESSED AND THE CHALLENGES OF ORCHESTRATING THESE VOICES IN WRITING THE SECOND DRAFT OF THE BASE DOCUMENT. IT SHALL CARRY OUT A RAID TO OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN WHICH BNCC IS REFERRED TO AND THE BASE PORTAL, VIRTUAL SPACE, CREATED BY THE MEC TO COLLECT AND GATHER CONTRIBUTIONS ON THE DRAFT TEXTS OF THE BASE. THEY ARE ADDRESSED ALSO SOME PROGRESS AND LIMITS OF THIS SECOND VERSION OF THE DOCUMENT AND POINTED OUT THE THREATS TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL CRISIS IN WHICH THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IS AT RISK. THE APPROACH OF RICHARD BOWE AND STEPHEN BALL POLICY CYCLE IS THE MAIN CONCEPTUAL TOOL USED IN THE CURRENT ANALYSIS.
77	THE CURRENT DISCOURSE ON INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AND INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION IS REPLETE WITH INACCURACIES AND HYPOTHETICAL FEARS. CERTAIN QUARTERS ARE CLAMORING FOR SWEEPING CHANGES THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT PROTECTION BY POLITICIZING THE EXISTING NEUTRAL, JURIDICAL SYSTEM FOR RESOLVING INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES. WITH THE IMPENDING EXPIRATION OF OVER 1,000 INVESTMENT TREATIES AND THE NEGOTIATION OF TWO TRADE AND INVESTMENT TREATIES THAT WOULD COVER 65% OF THE WORLD ECONOMY, THE SYSTEM STANDS AT A WATERSHED MOMENT, CALLING FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REBUTTAL TO CRITICS. WE ARGUE THAT PROPOSALS TO POLITICIZE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BY GIVING STATES CONTROL OVER ADJUDICATORS, INTRODUCING SELF-JUDGING DEFENSES, PERMITTING RETROACTIVE TREATY AMENDMENT THROUGH STATE PRACTICE, OR RELAXING THE RULES OF TREATY INTERPRETATION-SHOULD BE REJECTED. THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT INVESTMENT TREATIES AND ARBITRATION BENEFIT POOR STATES, ARE EVEN-HANDED, ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY, ALLOW STATES AMPLE REGULATORY LEEWAY, AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW.
78	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE 2004 UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON JURISDICTIONAL IMMUNITIES OF STATES AND THEIR PROPERTY SHOULD NOT SERVE AS A MODEL FOR A NEW CONVENTION WITH REGARD TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME ADVANTAGES IN PREPARING A DRAFT CONVENTION ON THE JURISDICTIONAL IMMUNITY OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS: IT WOULD MAKE THE LAW GOVERNING THE IMMUNITIES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS MORE 'EASILY ASCERTAINABLE'; A CONVENTION WOULD PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP THE LAW; AND IT WOULD MAKE A USEFUL COUNTERPART AND PARALLEL CONVENTION TO THE 2004 CONVENTION. HOWEVER, THIS PAPER CONTENDS THAT EACH OF THESE REASONS - WHILE APPEALING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HARMONIZATION AND A NOTION OF AN ACCESSIBLE AND PREDICTABLE INTERNATIONAL 'RULE OF LAW' - DOES NOT OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS OF PRINCIPLE, PRACTICE AND PRECEDENT. HOWEVER, THE IMMUNITIES AFFORDED TO STATE OFFICIALS MAY HAVE GREATER VALUE AS A MODEL FOR THE IMMUNITIES OF OFFICIALS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.
79	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A NEW ACCOUNT OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR: THE THESIS OF TACTICAL BALANCING. BUILDING ON EXISTING MODELS OF JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING, THE THESIS POSITS THAT HIGH COURT JUSTICES BALANCE A DISCRETE SET OF CONSIDERATIONS-JUSTICES' IDEOLOGIES, THEIR INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS, THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR RULINGS, PUBLIC OPINION, ELECTED LEADERS' PREFERENCES, AND LAW-AS THEY DECIDE IMPORTANT CASES. VARIATION IN A HIGH COURT'S BALANCING OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS AS IT DECIDES DIFFERENT CASES LEADS IT TO ALTERNATE BETWEEN CHALLENGING AND ENDORSING THE EXERCISE OF GOVERNMENT POWER. THE WAY IN WHICH HIGH COURTS CARRY OUT THIS "TACTICAL BALANCING" REFLECTS THEIR BROADER STRATEGY FOR PRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENT ROLES THEY CAN PLAY IN A POLITY, AND THUS HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND REGIME STABILITY IN DEVELOPING DEMOCRACIES. THE THESIS IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE BRAZILIAN HIGH COURT'S RULINGS ON CASES CONCERNING CRUCIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES (1985-2004).
80	THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BUREAUCRACY IN SYSTEMS OF DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNMENT IS STRONGER IN EASTERN THOUGHT THAN IN WESTERN PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICE. IN EAST ASIA, MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BUREAUCRACY IS BROADLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE BASED ON THE WORK OF CONFUCIUS AND HIS FOLLOWERS. MODERN SCHOLARS CONFIRM THAT THE PRIMARY COUNTRIES OF EAST ASIA HAVE DISTINCTIVE BUREAUCRATIC CULTURES TRACING TO CONFUCIAN IDEOLOGY. DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS OF CONFUCIAN IDEOLOGY INCLUDE RULE OF MAN VERSUS RULE OF LAW, DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PUBLIC OFFICIALS, THE NATURE OF MORAL CONVENTIONS AND PRACTICES IN GOVERNING, THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AND MERIT-FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS, HOLY GOOD OFFICIALS SHOULD DEAL WITH THOSE IN POLITICAL POWER THE LOGIC OF CIVIL RECIPROCITY, AND THE NATURE OF ORDER IN SOCIETY. FOLLOWING DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS OF CONFUCIAN MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BUREAUCRACY, THE ARTICLE CLOSES WITH A COMPARISON OF WESTERN AND EAST ASIAN APPROACHES TO THE MORAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BUREAUCRACY.
81	POLITICAL AND BUREAUCRATIC CORRUPTION IS A SOCIETAL THREAT IN EVERY COUNTRY. IT ALLOWS ORGANISED CRIME TO FLOURISH, SLOWS ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASES INCOME INEQUALITY, REDUCES GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND THREATENS CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY USES A "SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL" FROM A FRAMEWORK BASED ON ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS WHEREIN THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS WERE ESTABLISHED. THE CALIBRATED MODEL USES THE DATA ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY FROM 1996 TO 2020 FROM "THE WORLD BANK AND THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM" TO PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND CONTROL CORRUPTION IN THE FUTURE. THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION WAS TRENDING DOWNWARD IN THE NATIONS STUDIED. THE MODEL SHOWS THAT IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN REVERSE THIS DOWNWARD TREND. HOWEVER, IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND CONTROLLING CORRUPTION REQUIRES A COUNTRY-SPECIFIC APPROACH. THIS MODEL SUGGESTS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAYS THAT NATIONAL LEADERS AND POLICYMAKERS CAN IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THEREBY CONTROL CORRUPTION IN THEIR COUNTRY.
82	PORTUGUESE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS ALLOW US TO SEE ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE LEGAL-CONSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT OF STATES OF NECESSITY AND BY ADDING IN THE ADEQUATE MANAGEMENT OF COVID-19, BY ITS INSTITUTIONS, WE CAN SEE THE STUDY OF STATES OF SIEGE AND EMERGENCY ARE BOTH NECESSARY AND MANDATORY. FIRST AND FOREMOST, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PORTUGUESE HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, WITHOUT FORGETTING THE CONNECTIONS WITH SPANISH AND BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES, ALL OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS AND REGULATIONS THAT WERE INSTATED ARE BACKED AND ADDRESSED WITH REFERENCES TO NATIONAL HISTORICAL RECORDS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE STRUCTURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEPTS AND ITS EXTENSIVE REGULATIONS GRANT STATES IN TIMES OF NEED ENVIABLE STRENGTH AND ROBUSTNESS, GUARANTEEING THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS THE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND SECURITY OF ITS CITIZENS. WITHOUT FORGETTING OF COURSE, THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES AND OTHER MECHANISMS IN PLACE THAT ENABLE ITS CONTROL.
83	THE ARBITRATION IN GENEVA IN 1872 - BY WHICH GREAT BRITAIN SETTLED US CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST IT ARISING OUT OF THE CIVIL WAR - HAS ACHIEVED CANONICAL STATUS. IT IS USUALLY VIEWED AS MARKING THE BEGINNING OF THE EMERGENCE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, A MOVEMENT WHICH CULMINATED IN THE HAGUE CONVENTION OF 1899 AND LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE. THE ARBITRATION'S ORIGINS, HOWEVER, LIE AS MUCH IN REALPOLITIK AS IN IDEALISM. ITS CONDUCT HIGHLIGHTED AS MUCH THE FLAWS IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AS ITS VIRTUES. IT WAS, ABOVE ALL, A POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC EXPERIMENT THAT ALMOST RESULTED IN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT'S DISINTEGRATION IN JUNE 1872. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE, BY EXAMINING THE ORIGINS, CONDUCT AND IMMEDIATE POLITICAL IMPACT OF THE ARBITRATION, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ITS BRITISH PARTICIPANTS, IS TO PROVIDE A CORRECTIVE PRISM THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW IT AFRESH.
84	BETWEEN THE YEARS OF 2010 AND 2014, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE PUBLIC LAW SYSTEM TOOK PLACE IN HUNGARY SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION OF 1989. ACCORDING TO SOME, THIS HAS BEEN A REFORM, WHEREAS OTHERS REGARD IT AS DESTRUCTION. DURING THE TRANSFORMATION, OF COURSE, RELATIONS BETWEEN ALL BRANCHES OF POWER AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER FACTORS OF POWER HAD BEEN A SUBJECT OF DEBATE. YET - APART FROM THE GENERAL QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THE STATE POLICY ESTABLISHED BY 2014 COMPLIES WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON THE DIVISION OF POWER - FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF POWER THEORY THERE HAD BEEN THREE MAJOR ISSUES THAT INSTIGATED FIERCE DEBATES. THEY CONCERNED THE STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION (FUNDAMENTAL LAW) AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING POWER AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
85	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EARLY YEARS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE SMALL HIMALAYAN KINGDOM OF BHUTAN. ONCE A RECLUSIVE COUNTRY, BHUTAN EMBARKED ON A GRADUAL PATH OF SOCIOECONOMIC MODERNIZATION AND OPENING UP TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. A MOST SIGNIFICANT STEP ON THAT PATH WAS THE DECISION TO DEMOCRATIZE. THE FIRST NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN 2007-2008. IN 2013, THE SECOND NATIONAL ELECTIONS TOOK PLACE AND MARKED AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO ASSESS THE PROGRESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN BHUTAN. THIS ARTICLE NOT ONLY ANALYZES THE ELECTORAL EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO EVALUATES WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN OTHER AREAS OF DEMOCRATIZATION INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT BHUTAN HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN DEMOCRATIZATION ON MANY FRONTS BUT THAT ITS TRAJECTORY IS UNIQUE, REFLECTING THE PARTICULAR CONTEXT OF BHUTAN AND THE OVERRIDING CONCERN WITH STABILITY IN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE.
86	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF JOHN RAWLS'S JUSTIFICATION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC NUCLEAR DETERRENCE IN THE POST-COLD WAR ERA AS FOUND IN THE LAW OF PEOPLES. RAWLS'S JUSTIFICATION OVERLOOKED HOW NUCLEAR-ARMED LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ARE ENSNARED IN TWO INTRANSIGENT ETHICAL DILEMMAS: ONE IN WHICH THE MANDATE TO SECURE LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM REQUIRES BOTH THE PRESERVATION AND VIOLATION OF IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS, AND THE OTHER IN WHICH THIS SAME MANDATE REQUIRES BOTH THE PRESERVATION AND VIOLATION OF THE LIBERAL COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS AND TO THE RULE OF LAW GENERALLY. ON THIS VIEW, THE CHOICE TO VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS IS EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR DESPOTISM. MOREOVER, THIS CHOICE DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE ETHICAL FOREIGN POLICY DILEMMAS WERE RESOLVED. INSTEAD, IT IMPLIES THAT THE DILEMMAS FORCE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS INTO IMPLEMENTING ETHICALLY PARADOXICAL POLICY OUTCOMES.
87	AS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERE, WE ARE CONSTANTLY INTRIGUED BY THE QUESTION OF THE NATURE, SCOPE, AND LIMITATIONS OF DRAMATIC APPEALS THAT ARE MADE TO A HIGHER JUSTICE THAT APPEARS TO EXIST ALONG SIDE THE ESTABLISHED ORDER AND THE "RULE OF LAW." WHILE AS AMERICANS WE OPEN VIEW OURSELVES AS CONSTITUTIONALISTS, OBEDIENT CITIZENS WHO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE POSITIVE LAWS INSTANTIATED THROUGH THE DECISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE MESMERIZED BY THE WORDS AND DEEDS OF REVOLUTIONARIES WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SHED BLOOD IN THE NAME OF A HIGHER LAW. USING THE JOHN BROWN TRIAL AS A CASE EXAMPLE, THE ESSAY ARGUES THAT OUR JURISPRUDENTIAL NORMS ARE CO-PRODUCED BY BOTH TEXT WRITERS AND THEIR AUDIENCES. BY ADAPTING A PERFORMATIVE STANCE, WE CAN PERHAPS GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SELECTIVITY AND INVENTIVENESS INVOLVED IN LEGAL DECISIONMAKING.
88	GIVEN ITS SPECIAL GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND SIZE, SHANGHAI IS A KEY HUB LINKING WORLD AND LOCALITY, IN THIS CASE CHINA, IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANTI-COVID-19 MEASURES. BY COORDINATING ALL THE WORK ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW, SHANGHAI HAS OUTLINED THE BASIC FRAMEWORK FOR FIGHTING THE EPIDEMIC; BY ESTABLISHING THE COMMUNITY GRID GOVERNANCE MODEL, SHANGHAI HAS SOUNDLY HARNESSED THE 'POLITICAL POTENTIAL ENERGY' AND EFFECTIVELY FILLED IN THE INTERNAL MECHANISM OF ANTI-COVID-19 AND URBAN GOVERNANCE; AND BY RESPECTING PROFESSIONALISM AND THE ROLE OF THE MASSES, SHANGHAI SEIZED THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO FIGHT AGAINST THE EPIDEMIC. THEREFORE, SHANGHAI HAS BUILT UP PUBLIC VALUE AND GAINED SPIRITUAL SUPPORT TO FIGHT AGAINST THE EPIDEMIC AND FUNDAMENTALLY IMPROVED THE GOVERNANCE EFFICIENCY OF THE CITY. THE EXPERIENCE OF SHANGHAI'S ANTI-EPIDEMIC MEASURES AND GOVERNANCE FORMS AN ORGANIC WHOLE THROUGH MUTUAL EMBEDDING AND ULTIMATELY RELIES ON EFFICIENT AND FAIR GOVERNANCE.
89	CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS HAS TRADITIONALLY DRAWN HEAVILY ON THE MIDDLE POWER CONCEPT. THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO LOOK AT CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY FROM A NEW ANGLE: USING THE CONCEPT OF ONTOLOGICAL SECURITY, IT SHOWS HOW "CIVILIAN POWER" ELEMENTS SUCH AS MULTILATERALISM, INSTITUTION BUILDING, AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE CONNECTED TO CANADA'S IDENTITY AND FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE SYSTEMATICALLY COMPARES PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND SPEECHES BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REGARDING THE SYRIAN WAR. THE COMPARISON IS CONDUCTED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GOVERNMENTS' FOREIGN POLICY ACTIONS. ON A THEORETICAL LEVEL, THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSION ON CANADIAN IDENTITY AND ONTOLOGICAL SECURITY. FURTHERMORE, IT OFFERS A COMPARISON OF THE SYRIA POLICIES OF THE HARPER AND THE TRUDEAU GOVERNMENTS, ADDING TO THE LITERATURE ON DIFFERENCES AND CONTINUITIES BETWEEN CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY, AS WELL AS ON EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY AND THE SYRIAN WAR.
90	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STRUCTURE AND COMPETENCES OF THE COURT OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC UNION (EAEU COURT). IN DOING SO, IT PROVIDES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EAEU COURT WITH OTHER JUDICIAL BODIES CREATED IN THE POST-SOVIET AREA, THE ECONOMIC COURT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES AND THE COURT OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (COMMUNITY COURT), AS WELL AS IN SOME RESPECTS WITH THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU). SUMMARIZING MAJOR PROBLEMS OF THE EAEU COURT AND SETTING OUT THE COURT'S FIRST CASE, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE RULES GOVERNING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EAEU COURT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK AGAINST THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED PREVIOUSLY BY THE COMMUNITY COURT. THIS SETBACK REFLECTS THE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL OF THE EAEU MEMBERS TO TRANSFORM THE EAEU COURT INTO AN EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL BODY SIMILAR TO THE CJEU AND THEIR INSUFFICIENT COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
91	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES RUSSIAN LAW ON CRIMINAL MARKET MANIPULATION AND COMPARES IT WITH EQUIVALENT RULES IN WESTERN EUROPE. THE RUSSIAN RULES DO NOT WORK; NO ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED OR SENTENCED FOR MARKET MANIPULATION SINCE THE RELEVANT LAWS CAME INTO FORCE. THE RUSSIAN RULES ON CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR MARKET MANIPULATION DO NOT COMPLEMENT THE GENERAL RULES ON FRAUD, THEY DUPLICATE THEM. OUR PROHIBITION ON MARKET MANIPULATION IS UNCLEAR AND IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE, I.E., THERE ARE GAPS IN THE LAW. THIS PROHIBITION AND THE CRIMINAL LAW RULES BASED ON IT REQUIRE SERIOUS REVISION; IT IS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THE GAPS AND MAKE THE LAW CLEAR. IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO SUBORDINATE THE LIABILITY FOR THIS CRIME TO THE FACT OF CAUSING CONSEQUENCES EXPRESSED FORMALLY IN A SUM OF MONEY. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES A LOGICAL GENERALIZATION. ESTABLISHING CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENT MARKET MANIPULATION IN RUSSIA SEEMS PREMATURE.
92	ROCK CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER, OFTEN RADICALLY, THE NORMAL SITUATIONS OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY TAKE PLACE. PHISH CONCERTS ESPECIALLY REPRESENT LOCALIZED "SPACES OF EXCEPTIONS" TO THE RULE OF LAW SURROUNDING THE VENUES AND COMMUNAL PERIPHERIES IN WHICH THEY TAKE PLACE. IN THE VEIN OF ROUSSEAU'S "GENERAL WILL," PHISH FANS "WILL" BAKHTIN'S "CARNIVAL" INTO BEING, USING PHISH "EVENTS" AS CATALYSTS. THE AESTHETIC AND SOCIAL POTENTIAL OF CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS OFTEN CUTS TO THE CORE OF SOCIAL AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY, CASTING THE STATUS OF PARTICULAR CIVIL LAWS IN DOUBT. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING MORE FULLY THE AESTHETIC AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF PHISH CONCERTS, THE LOGISTICS OF CONCERT SECURITY, AND THE ROLES OF MUSICAL STYLES, DRESS, AND COMMERCE IN TERMS OF PHISH AS AN ENSEMBLE, ITS DEVOTED FANS, AND THE CONCEPT OF CARNIVAL INTEGRAL TO ITS MANY EVENTS.
93	AUTHORITARIAN RESPONSES TO RISING VIOLENT CRIME RATES HAVE BECOME A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN CENTRAL AMERICA. INSPIRED BY THEORIES OF AGENDA SETTING AND MEDIA FRAMING, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE OF CRIME ON ATTITUDES TOWARD CRIME CONTROL. USING AN ORIGINAL SURVEY EXPERIMENT, IT TESTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIME NEWS, FEAR OF CRIME, TRUST IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, AND SUPPORT FOR AUTHORITARIAN CRIME CONTROL MEASURES IN GUATEMALA. IT FINDS THAT CRIME NEWS INFLUENCES SUPPORT FOR AUTHORITARIAN CRIME CONTROL VIA ITS EFFECT ON LOWERING CITIZEN TRUST IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. EXPOSURE TO CRIME NEWS ALSO AFFECTS SELF-REPORTED VICTIMIZATION RATES AND LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PROMOTING IRON FIST POLICIES. THESE FINDINGS NOT ONLY GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIME NEWS AND POLITICAL ATTITUDES BUT ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE POLITICS OF CRIME IN NEW OR FRAGILE DEMOCRACIES.
94	DRAWING ON DATA FROM A MID-SIZED CITY IN EASTERN CHINA, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES INTERACTIONS AMONG THE COURTS, THE PARTY AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES. IT FINDS THAT, CAUGHT BETWEEN UNRULY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND LEGAL RHETORIC, THE COURTS SEEK SUPPORT FROM THE PARTY TO ENHANCE THEIR AUTHORITY. THEY THEN DEVISE TACTICS SUCH AS PUTTING AGENCIES' CHIEF OFFICIALS ON THE STAND, ISSUING JUDICIAL SUGGESTIONS AND APPLYING THE LAWS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS. THESE ARE OFTEN EFFECTIVE, BECAUSE AGENCIES ADJUST THEIR BEHAVIORS ACCORDINGLY. CONTRARY TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT THE COURTS ARE ONLY A PASSIVE ACTOR IN LOCAL POLITICS, THEIR ROLE IN TRANSLATING NATIONAL LAWS INTO LOCAL PRACTICE IS BY NO MEANS NEGLIGIBLE. BY EXPLORING THE DYNAMICS OF COURT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LOCAL POLITICS IS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE TRAJECTORY OF CHINA'S JUDICIALIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE, AND RULE OF LAW MORE GENERALLY.
95	THIS PAPER REVIEWS CURRENT THEORY AND RESEARCH THAT INDICATES THAT ATTITUDES HELD WITH STRONG MORAL CONVICTION ('MORAL MANDATES') REPRESENT SOMETHING PSYCHOLOGICALLY DISTINCT FROM OTHER CONSTRUCTS (E.G., ATTITUDE STRENGTH, PARTISANSHIP, OR RELIGIOSITY), AND THAT VARIANCE IN MORAL CONVICTION HAS IMPORTANT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES, SUCH AS INCREASED INTOLERANCE OF ATTITUDINALLY DISSIMILAR OTHERS, DIFFICULTIES IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION, INCREASED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT VIOLENT MEANS TO ACHIEVE PREFERRED ENDS, STRONG TIES TO POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, AND INOCULATION AGAINST THE USUAL PRESSURES TO OBEY AUTHORITIES, OBEY THE LAW, OR TO CONFORM TO MAJORITY GROUP INFLUENCE. THE NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE BOTH REASSURING (MORAL CONVICTIONS CAN PROTECT AGAINST OBEDIENCE TO POTENTIALLY MALEVOLENT AUTHORITIES) AND TERRIFYING (MORAL CONVICTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH REJECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND CAN PROVIDE A MOTIVATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR VIOLENT PROTEST AND ACTS OF TERRORISM). IMPLICATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED.
96	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA WITH A GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST AND IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS IN A PANEL VECTOR AUTOREGRESSION (VAR) MODEL. WITH ANNUAL OBSERVATIONS FROM A SAMPLE OF 18 COUNTRIES FROM 1962 TO 2005, IT IS SHOWN THAT WHILE ECONOMIC GROWTH CAUSES FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT DOES NOT CAUSE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS FINDING IS ROBUST TO DIFFERENT MODEL SPECIFICATIONS AND DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INDICATORS. INTERESTINGLY, WHEN THE SAMPLE IS DIVIDED ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, THERE IS TWO-WAY CAUSALITY BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH ONLY FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME GROUP AND FOR COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER RULE OF LAW AND CREDITOR RIGHTS. THE IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS SHOW THAT A SHOCK TO FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH ONLY FOR THESE SUBSAMPLES, BUT THE NET EFFECT OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON GROWTH IS RELATIVELY SMALL.
97	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CYCLES OF LEGALITY THAT FOLLOW THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. IT LOOKS TO TRENDS IN THE APEX COURTS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA, WITH A FOCUS ON THE LAST TWO. IN ONE CYCLE, ALL THE MAIN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS COOPERATE IN DEVISING A RESPONSE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE OTHER, A THIN VENEER OF LEGALITY OR AN EMPTY PROCEDURALISM IS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO COVER WHAT IS IN ESSENCE ARBITRARY POWER. ONE OF THESE CYCLES IS INEVITABLE BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL COMMITMENT BY STATES TO LEGALITY AS IS THE PARTICIPATION BY JUDGES IN POLICING IN SOME WAY THE LEGAL REGIMES CONSTRUCTED BY LEGISLATURES AND EXECUTIVES. THE MAIN QUESTION ADDRESSED IS WHETHER THE SECOND CYCLE IS MORE LIKELY, WHETHER, THAT IS, JUDGES MUST END UP GIVING THE STAMP OF LEGALITY TO ARBITRARY POWER.
98	OVER 25 AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAD PLANNED ELECTIONS FOR 2020. IN THE FACE OF THE ONSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MARCH, STATES RESORTED TO ONE OF TWO COURSES OF ACTION: ADHERENCE TO PLANNED ELECTORAL TIMELINES IN THE SHADOW OF THE OUTBREAK, WHICH LARGELY LED TO RECORD LOW VOTER TURNOUTS AND HASTENED THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS; OR ADJOURNING ELECTIONS WITH ILL-DEFINED ELECTION PROGRAMMING, CONSTITUTIONAL TENSIONS AND UNREST OVER DELAYED POLLS. THE GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS NOT ONLY FRUSTRATED THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS BUT SET SEVERE CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION AT A TIME OF LANDMARK ELECTIONS, NOTABLY IN ETHIOPIA, BURUNDI AND MALAWI. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES INITIAL STATE RESPONSES IN ELECTORAL ADMINISTRATION IN LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL ELECTORAL NORMS, AND INTERROGATES THE ROLE OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL MECHANISMS IN SECURING SAFE, INCLUSIVE, TIMELY, FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AMID NEW INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS.
99	THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC STATE EXERCISES POWER THROUGH AN ELEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL RATIONALITY, AND POLICE AND THE REASON OF THE STATE CONSTITUTE THIS RATIONALITY. THE REASON OF THE STATE AND THE REGULATION OF INDIVIDUAL CONDUCT IN A PANDEMIC GIVES PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE IDEA OF PUBLIC SAFETY. HERE, PUBLIC ORDER TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GEARED TO MEET ONLY ONE END, I.E., PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT DURING A PANDEMIC, THE POLICE CREATES DIFFERENT KINDS OF GOVERNMENTAL ORDER BY STRESSING ON SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY AS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT. IN DOING SO, THE POLICE FORM PUBLIC SAFETY AS A REASON OR AN ELEMENT OF STATE'S RATIONALE FOR ENFORCING LAWS, THEREBY CURTAILING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW POLICE CAN TRANSFORM THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE RULE OF ORDER WITHIN THE STATE BY CHANGING LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNIQUES TO MAINTAIN A STABLE POLITICAL ORDER.
100	THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE EFFECT OF FRAGILITY IN DESTINATION MARKETS ON FIRM EXPORT BEHAVIOR AND THE ROLE OF FIRM SIZE IN MEDIATING ADVERSE OUTCOMES. THE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED USING FIRM TRANSACTION DATA ON KENYAN EXPORTS TO AFRICA OVER THE PERIOD 2004-2013. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT FRAGILITY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS A FIRM'S DECISION TO ENTER A GIVEN DESTINATION MARKET, REDUCING KENYA'S BILATERAL TRADE FLOWS TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES. LARGER FIRMS ARE MORE RESILIENT TO DESTINATION SHOCKS IN FRAGILITY AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO EXIT. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF DESTINATION FRAGILITY, AND THE EXCLUSION OF BORDERING COUNTRIES AND THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY PARTNER STATES. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS FRAGILITY (REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) DOMINATES THAT OF POLITICAL FRAGILITY (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY), ALTHOUGH BOTH EFFECTS ARE NEGATIVE AND SIGNIFICANT.
101	WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND ENHANCED ATTENTION TO THE RULE OF LAW, TECHNICAL APPRAISEMENT TO RECONSTRUCT TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IS ATTRACTING INCREASING ATTENTION. ACCIDENT VIDEOS ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS IN IDENTIFICATION; HOWEVER, WE CANNOT RECONSTRUCT AN ACCIDENT SCENE ONSITE USING VIDEO FOR MANY REASONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A COMPUTER- BASED VIRTUAL REALITY METHOD THAT CAN DIGITALLY RECONSTRUCT A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT. THIS METHOD EMPLOYS ACCIDENT VIDEOS TO PERFORM A THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) RECONSTRUCTION OF ACCIDENT SCENES. USING VIDEO SCREENSHOTS, IT CONSTRUCTS A MODEL OF HUMANS AND VEHICLES IN 3D SPACE TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF DYNAMIC RESTORATION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS METHOD HAS RELATIVELY HIGH ACCURACY, REQUIRES LITTLE TIME AND IS EASY TO USE. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE THE SOURCES OF ERRORS FOR THIS METHOD AND SUMMARIZE THE APPLICATION CONDITIONS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
102	IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE RECENT PERIOD THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, THERE IS A RELENTLESS, DEVASTATING CONFLICT AMONG ALL BODIES OF THE STATE. TURKEY HAS RAPIDLY SHIFTED FROM HAVING A SEPARATION OF POWERS TOWARDS THE UNION OF POWERS AS A RESULT OF A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN A PLACE WHERE THE JUDICIARY IS NOT INDEPENDENT, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS A PROVEN FACT THAT THE MORE THAT CONFIDENCE IS FELT TOWARDS THE LAW AND FUNCTIONING OF THE LAW IN A COUNTRY, THE GREATER ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL BE. THE MORE INDEPENDENT THE JUDICIARY IS IN A COUNTRY, THE MORE CONFIDENCE THE INVESTOR WILL FEEL TOWARDS THAT COUNTRY, AND THUS, THE MORE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WILL EMERGE, THE GREATER GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL BE ACHIEVED, AND OF COURSE, THE MORE TAX OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE ENSURED FOR THE STATE.
103	THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SPANISH SYSTEM INCORPORATES FOUR LEVELS OF DIFFERENT RULES, INCLUDED THOSE WHICH REGULATE POWERS IN ORDER TO CONSENT THE USE OF THEIR RIGHTS (ACCESS RULES), STANDING OUT RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION REGULATED IN THE ARTICLE 24 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION. THIS RIGHT ALLOWS TO ACCEDE THE EFFECTIVE USE OF OTHERS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THAT'S WHY IT'S AN INSTRUMENTAL RIGHT, AND HAS A CONTENT AND LEGAL AND DOCTRINAL CONFIGURATION OF COMPLEX CHARACTER. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THAT FROM ITS EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ONE OF THE RULE OF LAW ESSENTIAL CATEGORIES, AS SUCH THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE PROBLEM WE CONSIDER IN THIS TEXT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH ITS COMPLEX ESSENTIAL CONTENT AND THE RESTRICTIVE O EXTENDED ESTIMATE IT CAN BE DOCTRINALLY CONSIDERED, WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL KIND THAT THE ONE OR THE OTHER OPTION CAUSES.
104	WHILE OFFERING TAX INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT HAS BECOME A GLOBAL PHENOMENON AND PART OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION IN THE 1990S, IT ALSO IS POLITICAL AND CONTROVERSIAL. BUT THE POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF TAX INCENTIVE POLICIES HAVE RARELY BEEN ANALYZED. THIS ARTICLE FILLS THIS GAP BY MAKING TWO CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, I OFFER A THEORY THAT EXPLAINS HOW POLITICAL REGIME TYPE INFLUENCES TAX INCENTIVE POLICY IN THE CROSS-NATIONAL SETTING. SECOND, I EVALUATE THE THEORY WITH A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF 52 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT MY MAIN THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS. COUNTRIES WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW OFFER LOWER LEVELS OF TAX INCENTIVES, AND THE EFFECT IS STRONGER FOR MORE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. IN DEMOCRACIES, FDI INFLOWS ARE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF INCENTIVES. AUTOCRATIC REGIMES MAINTAINING RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN ENTRY ADOPT LOWER LEVELS OF INCENTIVES THAN THOSE WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. I DISCUSS THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS.
105	THE FOLLOWING THESES ARE DEFENDED. TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER IS (A) A GOOD THING; (B) REFLECTS THE UNIVERSALIZING AND GLOBALIZING IMPULSE OF WESTERN TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED CULTURE; (C) IS BASED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH OF HUMAN FREEDOM; (D) REQUIRES NOT ONLY THE TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY BUT OF INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS SUCH AS THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROJECT ITSELF, FREE MARKET ECONOMIES, LIMITED GOVERNMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS TOLERATION AND PERSONAL AUTONOMY; (E) MAY REQUIRE THE RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF CULTURES RECEIVING THE TECHNOLOGY; (F) IS IMPEDED LARGELY BY THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE RECEIVING CULTURE TO ADJUST TO THE FULL SPECTRUM OF CHANGE; (G) CHALLENGES THOSE IN MACROMARKETING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES OF CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION; (H) AND, FINALLY, FACES A GRAVE THREAT FROM THOSE WHO ARE IN AN ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE "GRAND NARRATIVE OF WESTERN TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED CULTURE."

106	ALTHOUGH THE DEBATE REGARDING THE IMPACT OF HIGH-QUALITY INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS HAS GAINED INCREASING ATTENTION, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS DEBATE. USING DATA FROM 136 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2016, WE PROVIDE UNIQUE AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT TRANSCENDENT INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES AND CONSCIOUS GOVERNMENT POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS. OUR RESEARCH REVEALS THAT EFFECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES MUST BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN AT LEAST THREE MAIN INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS: PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS (THE RULE OF LAW), CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN ELECTIONS AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION (VOICE), AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. CLIMATE-FRIENDLY ECONOMIC POLICIES MUST CONSIDER IMPROVING SUCH INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADVANCING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INCREASING THE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY BY PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ENTITIES, AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE CONSUMPTION OF FOSSIL FUELS.
107	IT MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE TO THINK THAT A JUDICIAL DECISION CAN BE IGNORED. IT WOULD SEEM CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE GOOD GOVERNANCE OF OUR SOCIETY. RESPECT FOR JUDICIAL DECISIONS IS IMPORTANT. HOWEVER, THE AUTHORITIES INDICATE THAT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A JUDICIAL DECISION CAN BE IGNORED. IN CONSIDERING WHEN THAT MAY OCCUR, IT IS NECESSARY TO DRAW CERTAIN DISTINCTIONS. FIRST, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A COURTS' ORDERS AND ITS REASONS FOR JUDGMENT. SECOND, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT COURTS - IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN 'INFERIOR COURTS' AND 'SUPERIOR COURTS OF RECORD'. AND THIRD, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ACTORS WHO MIGHT WISH TO DISREGARD A JUDICIAL DECISION: AN INDIVIDUAL, THE EXECUTIVE, THE LEGISLATURE OR A COURT. IN THIS PAPER I WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT ARISE IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION I HAVE POSED, BY TO THESE DISTINCTIONS.
108	THE INJUSTICES WROUGHT BY UNEQUAL ACCESS TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW, YET SUCH INJUSTICES ARE WIDESPREAD IN ENGLAND AND ELSEWHERE. LAWYERS REGULARLY CRITICISE GOVERNMENTS FOR A LACK OF FUNDING FOR THE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR DELIVERING LEGAL SERVICES RECEIVES MUCH LESS SCRUTINY. A PRIVATE MARKET FOR LEGAL RESOURCES IS ANTITHETICAL TO EQUAL JUSTICE BECAUSE IT MAKES THE OUTCOME OF CASES TURN ON ARBITRARY FACTORS SUCH AS WEALTH. THE SOLUTION, ACCORDING TO WILMOT-SMITH IN HIS BOOK EQUAL JUSTICE, IS TO SOCIALISE THE ALLOCATION OF LEGAL SERVICES SO THAT THE RICH CANNOT BUY THE BEST LAWYERS, AND TO PREVENT THEM FROM CONTRACTING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC SYSTEM BY MAKING PRIVATE ARBITRATIONS UNENFORCEABLE. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WILMOT-SMITH'S THESIS IS PERSUASIVE, BUT THERE MIGHT ALSO BE SECOND-BEST SOLUTIONS THAT COULD DELIVER GREATER LEGAL EQUALITY AT LOWER COST.
109	THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO MODERN DEMOCRACIES. PROPORTIONALITY AND STRICT NECESSITY ARE ALSO ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LEGALITY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES' SURVEILLANCE ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, NOWADAYS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE PROPORTIONALITY OF A GIVEN MEASURE, ESPECIALLY SINCE ITS SURVEILLANCE EFFECT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO BECOME APPARENT. THAT IS WHY LEGISLATURES ARE INCREASINGLY INTRODUCING ADDITIONAL LEGAL SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ABUSE OF POWER. BUT CAN MORE MECHANISMS LIMITING SURVEILLANCE POWERS EFFECTIVELY MINIMIZE THE RISK THAT THESE POWERS WILL BE USED FOR NON-LEGAL PURPOSES? THIS KEY PROBLEM WILL BE DISCUSSED BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF POLAND - A EU MEMBER STATE WHOSE CASE WILL BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE THE LIMITED USEFULNESS OF THE "CHECKS AND BALANCES" MODEL IN A SITUATION WHERE A RESOLUTELY DETERMINED AUTHORITY SYSTEMATICALLY AIMS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS IN VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
110	THIS PAPER CHALLENGES THE FAMILIAR STRATEGY FOR THEORISING ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THEORIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TYPICALLY TAKE THE EXISTENCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES FOR GRANTED, AND THEN ASK, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, WHAT MORAL AIM THEY SHOULD SERVE. THE RESULTING APPROACHES ARE COMMITTED TO VARYING MORAL AIMS RANGING FROM THE RULE OF LAW TO EFFICIENCY, BUT CONVERGE ON THE SHARED IDEA THAT THE PURPOSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS TO PROMOTE AIMS THAT COULD, IN PRINCIPLE, BE REALISED APART FROM IT. AS A CRITICAL MATTER, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE FAMILIAR STRATEGY OPENS THE DOOR TO A DEVASTATING SCEPTICAL CHALLENGE. BECAUSE THE BENEFITS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BRINGS CAN BE REALISED WITHOUT IT, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW MAY BE RIGHTLY ABANDONED. AS A CONSTRUCTIVE MATTER, THIS PAPER DEFENDS THE IDEA THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HAS A MORAL PURPOSE THAT IS INSEPARABLE FROM IT: ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONSTITUTES THE EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF REALISING WHAT POSITIVE RIGHTS DEMAND.
111	THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHY PROPERTY CLAIMANTS BRING THEIR CASES TO COURT IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WHEN MANY PERCEIVE THE SYSTEM TO BE CORRUPT AND COOPTED BY MORE POWERFUL POLITICAL PLAYERS. AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY IN KYRGYZSTAN SHOWS HOW AN ELITE PROPERTY CLAIMANT (AZIM) SOUGHT TO BUILD AUTHORITY FOR HIS PROPERTY CLAIMS AND TO FACILITATE THEIR CONTINUED SALIENCE IN FLUID POLITICAL CONTEXTS BY TAKING CASES TO COURT. ALTHOUGH AZIM FILED AND WON CASES, THE RULINGS WERE NOT ENFORCED; YET HE STILL CONTINUED TO MAKE CLAIMS, HOPING THAT CHANGING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS WOULD AT SOME FUTURE TIME LEAD TO THE CREATION OF AUTHORITATIVE BUREAUCRATIC AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT WOULD RENDER THOSE CLAIMS VALID. MY BROADER FINDING IS THAT IN WEAK RULE-OF-LAW SOCIETIES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ASPIRATIONAL MOTIVATIONS AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PURSUIT OF LEGAL STRATEGIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SEEM PUZZLING.
112	THE 2030 AGENDA ENVISAGES A WORLD "IN WHICH DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW [ HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS ] ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT" (TRANSFORMING OUR WORLD: THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, 2015, PARAGRAPH 9). HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES CAN HELP OR HINDER SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REMAINS CONTESTED. I SHOW HOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY CAN BE ILLUMINATED BY RECENT ADVANCES IN RESEARCH ON POLICY COHERENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. I APPLY A FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED BY SHAWOO ET AL., (2022), TO ILLUSTRATE HOW (IN)COHERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO OBJECTIVES IS DRIVEN BY A MIX OF IDEAS, INSTITUTIONS AND INTERESTS. THIS FRAMEWORK CAN, IN TURN, HELP TO IDENTIFY POLICY OPTIONS FOR STRENGTHENING COHERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL AIMS, SPANNING PLURALISATION OF INTEGRATIVE FRAMES AND DISCOURSES, INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND REFORMS THAT BROADEN THE RANGE OF PUBLIC INTERESTS INCLUDED IN DECISION-MAKING WHILE RESTRAINING UNDUE INFLUENCE OF VESTED INTERESTS.
113	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO STUDY THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF OBTAINING EVIDENCE ON THE INITIATIVE OF THE COURT IN THE ECONOMIC PROCESS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, TO SUBSTANTIATE THE PROPOSALS FOR REFORMING THE ECONOMIC PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE. IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS WERE USED METHODS OF GENERAL AND SPECIAL, NAMELY: HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL, SYNERGISTIC, STRUCTURAL SYSTEMIC, ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, LOGICAL AND GENERALIZATION METHOD. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT EVIDENCE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN ENSURING A PROMPT AND THOROUGH CONSIDERATION OF THE CASE CANNOT BE PASSIVE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE COURT, WHILE MAINTAINING OBJECTIVITY AND IMPARTIALITY, MUST ASSIST THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRIAL IN EXERCISING THEIR RIGHTS, PREVENT ANY KIND OF ABUSE AND TAKE MEASURES TO FULFIL ITS JUDICIAL DUTIES, AS A CONDITION OF POSSIBILITY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
114	GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IS A MULTIFACETED DISCOURSE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF BUILDING UP GLOBAL LAW BY RECONSTRUCTING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. IT PROMISES MUCH TO BETTER COMPREHEND THE BLACK HOLES OF GLOBALISATION, INCLUDING ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS DISCOURSE' EXPANSIVE SCOPE NECESSITATES QUESTIONING ITS RELATIONSHIP TO ONGOING DISCOURSES ON THE RECENT GLOBAL RISE OF AUTHORITARIANISM. HOWEVER, GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM DISCOURSE IS HEAVILY SHAPED BY NORMATIVE THEORIES THAT REFLECT LIMITED, DISCRETE AND SUBJECTIVE VIEWS ON THE GLOBAL ORDER THAT FAIL TO MIRROR INTERSUBJECTIVE MEANINGS OF THE CENTRAL SUBJECTS OF THE DISCOURSE. THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM BEYOND THIS FRAMEWORK AND WILL INTRODUCE "GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONAL CULTURE" AS THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM DISCOURSE. IN DOING SO, THIS PAPER WILL SEEK RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM DISCOURSE IN VIEW OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASPECTS THEREOF, INCLUDING LIBERAL AND EMANCIPATORY CLAIMS ATTRIBUTED TO IT.
115	THE DAWN OF THE NEW SECOND REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE RAISED THE HOPES OF THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE FORA MOMENT. ZIMBABWE HAS EXPERIENCED DIVERSE CHALLENGES, INCLUDING SOCIOECONOMIC MELTDOWNS, A DECLINE IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE. TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS USE 'HATE SPEECH' TO EXPRESS THEIR IDEOLOGIES AND CRITICISE THEIR OPPONENTS' STRUGGLE TO WIN PEOPLE. THE AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MADE IT EASY FOR THESE ATTACKING STATEMENTS TO REACH A WIDER AUDIENCE. THROUGH DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS USE HATE SPEECH AS ELECTIONEERING AND A RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEMS BEDEVILING ZIMBABWE. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT HATE SPEECH FROM POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IS SOCIALISING SOME ZIMBABWEANS INTO VIOLENT, ANGRY INDIVIDUALS, MURDERERS, AND VANDALS. THE PROBLEM OF HATE SPEECH IS THAT IT CREATES VIOLENCE, CAUSES PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS, DEHUMANISES PEOPLE, AND CONDITIONS A NEGATIVE NATIONAL TRAIT.
116	THE RISE OF MODERN AUTHORITARIANISM IS DISTINGUISHED BY ITS INCREASING SOPHISTICATION IN THE TECHNIQUES OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE. IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND THESE MODERN AUTHORITARIAN TECHNIQUES WITHIN A LARGER FRAMEWORK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR THEORETICAL PROVENANCE, INTERRELATIONSHIP AND EFFICACY? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE MODERN STATE HAS SHAPED THE FORM AND EXPRESSION OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT SHOWS HOW THOMAS HOBBES, THE INFLUENTIAL THEORETICAL FOUNDER OF THE MODERN STATE, CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE MODERN "MANUAL" OF AUTHORITARIAN LEADERSHIP, WITH ITS DISTINCTIVE USE OF RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONS, VOTING AND ELECTIONS, AND A FREE MARKETPLACE AS MEANS TO ENHANCE POWER AND CONSOLIDATE RULE. UNDERSTANDING THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THIS MODERN MANUAL IS VALUABLE FOR PROVIDING NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE EFFICACY OF THESE TECHNIQUES AND THEREBY THE DANGERS POSED BY MODERN AUTHORITARIANS AND THE MEANS TO COUNTER THEIR THREAT.
117	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC). IN SETTING THE GENERAL CONTEXT, THE MAIN THEORIES OF WATER RIGHTS REGULATING THE UTILISATION OF INTERNATIONAL WATERCOURSE SYSTEMS AND THE CONSTITUTIVE FOUNDATIONS OF A LEGAL REGIME ENCAPSULATED IN THE UN WATERCOURSES CONVENTION ARE DISCUSSED. THE REVISED SADC WATER PROTOCOL'S SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF INTERNATIONAL WATERCOURSES IS ASSESSED. IN EXPLORING THE CHALLENGES OF THE WATER PROTOCOL'S IMPLEMENTATION, EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE URGENT NEED TO EXECUTE COMPLEMENTARY SUPPORTING MEASURES IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABLE LEGAL INTERVENTION IN SHARED RIVER BASINS IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. IT CONCLUDES THAT VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE UN WATERCOURSES CONVENTION AND THE SADC WATER PROTOCOL DEMONSTRATE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE RECOGNITION BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL NORMS IN ENHANCING COOPERATION AND MANAGING CONFLICT IN INTERNATIONAL WATERCOURSES.
118	THOUGH THE EU IS A RULE OF LAW COMMUNITY IT STRUGGLES TO MAKE ALL MEMBER STATES ENGAGE FULLY IN UPHOLDING ITS LAWS AND VALUES. SOME ISSUES HAVE TO DO WITH CONCRETE VIOLATIONS AGAINST BASIC RIGHTS OTHERS ARE MORE INSTITUTIONAL HAVING TO DO WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS SUCH. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE LOOK AT THE INSTITUTIONAL SIDE DEMONSTRATING THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF A MEMBER STATE ENJOYS FULL INDEPENDENCE AND ITS NATIONAL HIGH COURT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CJEU THROUGH THE PRELIMINARY REFERENCE PROCEDURE. WHILE DRAWING ON JUDICIAL DIALOGUE INSTRUMENTS, IT IS DEMONSTRATED HOW HIGHER COURTS THAT ARE LESS CONSTRAINED BY POLITICAL POWER MAKE MORE PRELIMINARY REFERENCES. THIS FINDING SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GOVERNMENTS THAT KEEP COURTS IN A SHORT LEACH OFTEN DISCOURAGE JUDGES FROM ENGAGING WITH LUXEMBOURG, IMPACTING IN THE LONGER RUN THE UNIFORM DEVELOPMENT OF EU LAW.
119	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES DENMARK'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE NORD STREAM 2 GAS PIPELINE PROJECT. IMPRESSING THE BALTIC AS A SEA OF STRATEGIC SIGNIFICANCE AND A POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL FLASHPOINT, THE CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT THRUST DENMARK INTO A POSITION OF DECISION-MAKING IMPORTANCE BEYOND ITS SIZE AND MATERIAL POWER. GEOPOLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND NORMATIVE IMPETUS DERIVED FROM A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL CULTURE, INFLUENCED DANISH ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE PROJECT. THE IMPACT OF THESE CONCERNS SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYED THE GRANTING OF A PERMIT FOR PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION IN THE DANISH MARINE SPACE, FRUSTRATING GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESS IN RUSSIA AND GERMANY. ULTIMATELY, APPROVAL WAS GRANTED BECAUSE DENMARK IS A RULE OF LAW STATE. YET THE DELAY IS CRUCIAL. MORE BROADLY, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HOW, IN THE ENERGY POLICY DOMAIN, ILLIBERAL REGIMES ATTEMPT TO EXPLOIT LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC LEGAL SYSTEMS THROUGH NOMINALLY COMMERCIAL ENTITIES, AND CONSIDERS THE RESPONSES BY OTHER ACTORS IN THIS CASE.
120	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) - COMPUTERISED TECHNOLOGY THAT IMITATES ASPECTS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE - IS DEVELOPING AT A RAPID PACE. IT IS INCREASINGLY USED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MULTIFARIOUS PROCESSES IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. AMONG THE STATUTORY AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE BEGUN TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL FOR AI TO ASSIST THEM ARE REGULATORS OF AUSTRALIA'S HEALTH PROFESSIONS. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS A CHIEF OBJECTIVE OF THIS AREA OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THIS SECTION CONSIDERS SOME POSSIBLE USES OF AI - AND PARTICULARLY ITS CAPACITIES TO ANALYSE AND DRAW INFERENCES FROM DATA, MAKE PREDICTIONS AND DECISIONS, AND AUTOMATE TASKS - THAT MIGHT HELP REGULATORS ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THE SECTION ALSO CONTEMPLATES THE IMPLICATIONS OF AI INVOLVEMENT IN THE REGULATION OF HEALTH PRACTITIONERS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IT PROTECTS AND RECOMMENDS MEASURES THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO MITIGATE RISKS OF THEIR INFRINGEMENT.
121	THIS ARTICLE ATTENDS TO A KEY CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF PERSECUTION OF RADICALIZED POLITICAL SECTORS IN ARGENTINA: THE REPRESSION OF COMMUNISM DURING THE EARLY 1930S, LED BY THE SPECIAL SECTION OF THE CAPITAL POLICE. THE AIM IS TO SYSTEMATIZE AND CHARACTERIZE ITS ACTIONS, DENOUNCED BEFORE JUSTICE AND THE PARLIAMENT, AND TO INVESTIGATE TO WHAT EXTENT IT IMPLIED (OR NOT) A BREAKING POINT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS ACTIONS AND CONCEPTIONS OF FORCE AS WELL AS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK INVOLVED. THE ARTICLE REVIEWS THE CONCEPTIONS AND THE REPRESSIVE ACTIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CENTURY, ATTENDING TO THE ORIENTATION OF POLICE DOCUMENTS DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS. IT ANALYZES IN PARTICULAR THE REACTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT BLOCS OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED YET. THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT BASED ON PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS, A NEW STAGE BEGAN MARKED BY THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW.
122	CONVIVENCIA' REFERS TO THE COEXISTENCE OF MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS AND JEWS DURING THE PERIOD OF MUSLIM RULE IN SPAIN (711-1492). LIKE THE HISTORIAN ISAAK MARKUS JOST (1793-1860), HEINE FORMED AN IDEALIZED IMAGE OF MUSLIM SPAIN IN SUPPORT OF HIS OWN CULTURAL AMBITIONS. HEINE'S IDENTIFICATION WITH MARRANOS IS WELL DOCUMENTED (VEIT). THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE DEPICTION OF CONVIVENCIA' IN TWO TEXTS BY HEINE, THE DRAMA ALMANSOR AND THE POEM JEHUDA BEN HALEVY'. IN ACCORDANCE WITH HEINE'S SOURCES, THE CHORUS OF ALMANSOR PRESENTS MUSLIM SPAIN AS A CENTRE OF CULTURAL AND RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE FOR MODERN EUROPEANS TO EMULATE. THREE DECADES LATER, HEINE'S POEM JEHUDA BEN HALEVY' PRESENTS A MORE TROUBLED PICTURE, AS TWO OF THE THREE SEPHARDI POETS ARE MURDERED. CRUCIALLY, THOUGH, IN CORDOBA THE MURDERER IS PUNISHED. IN THIS WAY, THE POEM ASSERTS THAT THE RULE OF LAW PREVAILED IN MUSLIM SPAIN.
123	IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE PREMODERN MIDDLE EAST, THE CLOSEST THING TO AN AUTONOMOUS PRIVATE ORGANIZATION WAS THE ISLAMIC WAQF. THIS NON-STATE INSTITUTION INHIBITED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, AND RULE OF LAW, AMONG OTHER INDICATORS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. IT DID SO THROUGH SEVERAL MECHANISMS. ITS ACTIVITIES WERE ESSENTIALLY SET BY ITS FOUNDER, WHICH LIMITED ITS CAPACITY TO MEET POLITICAL CHALLENGES. BEING DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SERVICE ON ITS OWN, IT COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN LASTING POLITICAL COALITIONS. THE WAQF'S BENEFICIARIES HAD NO SAY IN EVALUATING OR SELECTING ITS OFFICERS, AND THEY HAD TROUBLE FORMING A POLITICAL COMMUNITY. THUS, FOR ALL THE RESOURCES IT CONTROLLED, THE ISLAMIC WAQF CONTRIBUTED MINIMALLY TO BUILDING CIVIL SOCIETY. AS A CORE ELEMENT OF ISLAM'S CLASSICAL INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEX, IT PERPETUATED AUTHORITARIAN RULE BY KEEPING THE STATE LARGELY UNRESTRAINED. THEREIN LIES A KEY REASON FOR THE SLOW PACE OF THE MIDDLE EAST'S DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS.
124	MUCH RESEARCH HAS ARGUED FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF STATE'S ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY FOR DEVELOPMENT. DISREGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND FAILURE TO GET CORRUPTION UNDER CONTROL ARE SEEN AS DETRIMENTAL TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE CHINA PARADOX REFERS TO THE FACT THAT IN ALL COMMONLY USED MEASURES OF LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT, CHINA IS A COUNTRY THAT SCORES QUITE LOW. CHINA ALSO LACKS THE WEBERIAN MODEL OF BUREAUCRACY THAT IS SEEN AS CENTRAL FOR DEVELOPMENT. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS PARADOX IS THE RESULT OF DISREGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF A DIFFERENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MODEL IN CHINA-THE CADRE ORGANIZATION. INSTEAD OF RULE FOLLOWING, THIS ORGANIZATION IS MARKED BY HIGH COMMITMENT TO A SPECIFIC POLICY DOCTRINE. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHILE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WEBERIAN BUREAUCRACY, THIS ORGANIZATION IS WELL SUITED FOR EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTING POLICIES FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
125	REVELATIONS CONCERNING GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE OF MASS COMMUNICATIONS DATA HAVE CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED THE PAUCITY OF LEGAL REGULATION IN THIS AREA. SURVEILLANCE ALMOST INEVITABLY ENGAGES THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY BUT SUCH IS THE NOTORIOUSLY NEBULOUS NATURE OF PRIVACY, PARTICULARLY ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE, THAT IT FAILS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS AGAINST STATE ABUSES OF SURVEILLANCE CAPACITY. IN THE FACE OF NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS PRIVACY APPEARS TO BE ROUTINELY RELEGATED TO BEING AN INCONVENIENT OBSTACLE. THE CAPACITY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM TO CARRY OUT SURVEILLANCE ON AN ENORMOUS SCALE HAS HIGHLIGHTED NOT ONLY THE INADEQUACIES OF THEIR OWN DOMESTIC REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS BUT ALSO THE EASE WITH WHICH, THROUGH MODERN COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY, UNFETTERED GLOBAL SURVEILLANCE CAN TAKE PLACE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THESE ISSUES AND FURTHER CONSIDERS THE NORMATIVE INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT SHOULD APPLY TO SURVEILLANCE IF IT IS TO TAKE PLACE ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES.
126	WE EXAMINE WHETHER THE LEVEL OF DEFERENCE SHOWN BY THE ISRAELI SUPREME COURT TO MILITARY DECISIONS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME BY EMPIRICALLY ANALYZING THE ENTIRE BODY OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS IN PETITIONS AGAINST THE MILITARY COMMANDER BETWEEN 1990 AND 2005. SETTING FORTH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT MIGHT GENERALLY AFFECT THE DEGREE OF DEFERENCE TO STATE AGENCIES, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THERE WOULD BE A DECREASE IN DEFERENCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE MILITARY COMMANDER DURING THE EXAMINED PERIOD. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT DEFERENCE TO THE MILITARY COMMANDER HAS INDEED DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS BEST EXPLAINED BY THE CONTINUATION OF THE ARMED CONFLICT (AND ITS AFTERMATH, NAMELY, THE ROUTINIZATION AND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PETITIONS BY THE CIVILIAN POPULATION) AND ALSO-TO SOME EXTENT-BY THE RISE OF A SUBSTANTIVE RULE-OF-LAW LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, CENTRAL TO WHICH IS THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
127	THE SCOPE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT LIMITED TO TERMINOLOGY OR THE ETYMOLOGY OF ITS TRANSLATION, ON THE CONTRARY, EVERYTHING IS IN RELATIONSHIPS THAT SHOULD MARK THE CONDUCT OF THE STATE AGAINST THE CITIZENS IN IT AND IS STRENGTHENED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN DIGNITY, WHICH HAD BEEN TREATED SINCE THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, BUT NOW BECOMES MORE EFFECTIVE, GIVEN THE HIGH CONCENTRATION OF THE GUARANTORS OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS TO PRESERVE THE FRONT OF THE SOCIAL CONGLOMERATE. IN THE STATE OF OPINION, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE RULES, THEY WILL WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THE DAILY AS THE RULER OF THE DAY AND WHAT THE ATTACHMENT IS NO PREMIUM OR COMPLIANCE, BUT THE HANDLING OR THE RULERS OF THE MAKE-SHIFT PUBLIC OPINION THROUGH THE MASS MEDIA AND THE HANDLING OF THE POLLS USED TO BURY A CATAPULT OR A RULER OR GOVERNMENT AT A PARTICULAR STATUS.
128	THE STARTING POINT OF THIS ESSAY IS THE OBSERVATION THAT A LARGE BACKLOG OF REFORMS HAS ARISEN IN SOME EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES AND THAT THERE IS OFTEN A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO DEAL DEFINITIVELY WITH THESE LONG OUTSTANDING ISSUES. HORST MOLLER THEREFORE POINTS OUT THAT DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND PARLIAMENTARY CONSTITUTIONS ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, BUT INSTEAD HAVE TO BE LEGITIMISED AND REFORMED TIME AND TIME AGAIN IF THE), ARE TO ESCAPE COLLAPSE; AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN GO WRONG, THE AUTHOR USES THE INTERWAR PERIOD, DURING WHICH ALMOST ALL EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES SUCCUMBED TO INHERENT THREATS AND MISTAKEN DEVELOPMENTS. THUS THE ESSAY IS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE TRADITION OF CULTURAL PESSIMISM - IT SEES ITSELF RATHER AS A PREMONITORY PLEA TO RAPIDLY AND SWEEPINGLY ENGAGE IN THE NECESSARY REFORMS TO AVERT THE THREATENING BUT OFTEN IGNORED DANAERS FOR DEMOCRACY.
129	HARD CASES MAKE NOTORIOUSLY BAD LAW, AND THEY ALSO MAKE A BAD BASIS FOR ASSERTING THAT THERE IS NO LAW. THE US-LED WAR AGAINST IRAQ, AND DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT IT IN THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, DO NOT MEAN THAT THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY ATTEMPTS TO SUBJECT THE USE OF FORCE TO THE RULE OF LAW HAVE COLLAPSED. IN THE IRAQ CRISIS, THE US AND UK ASSERTED A STRONG LEGAL BASIS FOR THEIR RESORT TO FORCE, NAMELY, EXISTING SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS. MORE GENERALLY, BOTH WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND BEYOND, A WIDE VARIETY OF GROUNDS FOR INTERVENTION IN STATES HAS BEEN RECOGNISED IN INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE. HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP DOCTRINES OF PRE-EMPTION AND HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION HAVE NOT COMMANDED BROAD SUPPORT, SINCE MOST STATES STILL VALUE THE NONINTERVENTION NORM. DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN STATES ON THE LEGITIMACY OF CERTAIN USES OF FORCE REMAIN SERIOUS AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.
130	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI) OF BRITISH MULTINATIONAL FIRMS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS ACROSS 2009-2019 USING BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING. WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE EXISTENCE AND DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF THE EAST-WEST STRUCTURE OF FDI BETWEEN THREE GROUPS OF COUNTRIES: CORE-EU, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES (CEE), AND THE NORDICS. FURTHER, WE DOCUMENT THE IMPORTANCE OF RELATIVE MARKET SIZE, URBANIZATION, THE RULE OF LAW IN ATTAINING HORIZONTAL FDI IN THE CORE-EU ECONOMIES. IN TURN, INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND ENHANCED POLITICAL STABILITY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR FDI IN CEE (POST-2000 ACCESSION). FINALLY, OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE EUROZONE CRISIS AND BREXIT ANTICIPATION ON BRITISH OFDI ACTIVITY IN THE REGION. THE FINDINGS REMAIN ROBUST WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL MNE PROFIT SHIFTING TO PARTNERS SUCH AS IRELAND, LUXEMBOURG, AND ALIKE.
131	DECLARATIONS OF INDEPENDENCE (DOIS) TEND TO EMPLOY THE GRIEVANCE TOPOI AS A MEANS TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR DEMANDS FOR STATEHOOD. WE FIND, HOWEVER, THAT AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR A NEW SUBGENRE OF DOIS EMERGED, WHICH DEPLOYS TOPOI NOT REFERRING TO GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE HOST STATE. THESE DOIS FOCUS ON COMMITMENTS THE SECESSIONIST STATE MAKES TOWARDS EXISTING STATES. WE ANALYSE FOUR DOIS, THAT OF SLOVENIA, CROATIA, ABKHAZIA, AND KOSOVO USING WODAK ET AL.'S CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND WENDT'S CATEGORIZATION OF STATE IDENTITY. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THESE SECESSIONIST STATES PLEDGE TO ADHERE TO THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED NORMS OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND PUT FORWARD A DISCOURSE OF "BELONGING" TO A FAMILY OF STATES DEFINED BY THESE NORMS. THEY CALL THEREFORE FOR INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION BASED ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO SOCIALIZATION AVOIDING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOST STATE AND THE ISSUE OF BREACH OF TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY.
132	THE PROTECTION OF SOURCE CONFIDENTIALITY IS AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION FOR JOURNALISTS AND A CENTRAL TENET OF PRESS FREEDOM. THE VULNERABILITY OF SOURCE CONFIDENTIALITY IN AUSTRALIA WAS LAID BARE IN JUNE 2019 WHEN THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE (AFP) EXECUTED RAIDS ON THE HOME OF NEWS CORP JOURNALIST ANNIKA SMETHURST AND THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION'S SYDNEY HEADQUARTERS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE SCENARIO PRESENTED BY THE AFP RAIDS, AND THE SEPARATE LEGAL CHALLENGES BY SMETHURST AND THE ABC WHICH FOLLOWED. IT CRITIQUES THE POTENTIAL FOR DISTINCT FIELDS OF LAW TO PROTECT SOURCE CONFIDENTIALITY IN THE FEDERAL SEARCH AND SEIZURE CONTEXT, NAMELY: PRIVACY RIGHTS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLIED FREEDOM OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION, AND NOTIONS OF PRIVILEGE AND CONFIDENTIALITY. THIS ANALYSIS REVEALS A PRESSING NEED FOR LAW REFORM AND ARGUES THAT PRIVILEGE COULD OFFER AN APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE OPTION IN PROTECTING BOTH PRESS FREEDOM AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AS DISTINCT COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
133	SEPARATE WASTE COLLECTION IN ITALY COMES UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES, PROVINCES, WHILE NATIONAL LAWS SET QUANTITATIVE TARGETS TO BE ACHIEVED OVER TIME. OVERALL, JUST A FEW PROVINCES HAVE REACHED THE THRESHOLDS SET BY THE LATEST LAW (LEGISLATIVE DECREE 152/2006) AND SOME TERRITORIAL DIFFERENTIATION HAS BEEN DETECTED. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TWOFOLD: TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE 152/2006 IN PROMOTING HIGHER LEVELS OF SEPARATE COLLECTION AND TO TEST WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION) AFFECTS PROVINCES' EFFICIENCY IN THE SEPARATE COLLECTION PROCESS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE IMPLEMENT THE STOCHASTIC FRONTIER ANALYSIS (SFA). RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE 152/2006 HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY PROVINCES' INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE PRESENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS DID NOT ALLOW THE MOST VIRTUOUS PROVINCES TO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS SET BY LAW.
134	CATHOLIC DOCTRINE'S STRICT PROHIBITION ON ABORTION CAN LEAD CLINICIANS OR INSTITUTIONS TO CONSCIENTIOUSLY REFUSE TO PROVIDE ABORTION, ALTHOUGH A LEGAL DUTY TO PROVIDE ABORTION WOULD APPLY TO ANYONE WHO REFUSED. CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSALS BY CLINICIANS TO END A PREGNANCY CAN CONSTITUTE MURDER OR RECKLESS HOMICIDE UNDER AMERICAN LAW IF A WOMAN DIES AS A RESULT OF SUCH A REFUSAL. SUCH REFUSALS ARE NOT IMMUNIZED FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION OR BY STATUTES THAT CONFER IMMUNITY FROM CRIMINAL HOMICIDE PROSECUTION. CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRE THE STATE TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF ALL PERSONS EQUALLY AND TO PLACE THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF PERSONS ABOVE ANY THE INTERESTS OF PROVIDERS HAVE IN MORAL INTEGRITY OR IN RESPECTING THE MORAL STATUS OF PRENATAL HUMANS. IN SOME STATES CRIMINAL LIABILITY RELATED TO CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION ALSO APPLIES TO CORPORATE HOSPITAL OFFICIALS.
135	CERTAIN CUSTOMARY NORMS COMPLICATE THE WORK OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS (ICTS). THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY PRESCRIBES THAT NO ONE CAN BE CONVICTED FOR 'NEW' OR ILL-DEFINED CRIMES, AND THE RULES ON PERSONAL IMMUNITY BAR ICTS FROM PROSECUTING HIGH-LEVEL DEFENDANTS. IN CASES INVOLVING THESE ISSUES, ICTS FACE THE DILEMMA OF WEIGHING FUNDAMENTAL 'RULE OF LAW' PRINCIPLES AGAINST THEIR CORE OBJECTIVE: TO HOLD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMES. VARIOUS ICTS HAVE RESORTED TO WHAT SOME COMMENTATORS EUPHEMISTICALLY CALL 'CREATIVE' APPLICATION OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT CRITICS LABEL AS 'POOR LEGAL REASONING'. BY EXAMINING EXAMPLES OF SUCH RULINGS, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON A RECENT STRING OF DECISIONS BY THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) REGARDING HEAD OF STATE IMMUNITY, THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS A MODUS OPERANDI OF ICTS CONFRONTED WITH THE ARDUOUS CHOICE BETWEEN 'SAFE-BET' APPLICATION OF THE RELEVANT SOURCES OF LAW AND ENSURING INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE.
136	THE EFFECT OF STATE REGULATION OF RELIGION ON GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN EXPLORED THEORETICALLY BY SCHOLARS, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EMPIRICALLY ACROSS NATION STATES. THE THEORY POSITS THAT SECULAR STATES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM BETTER GOVERNANCE BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF CLERICAL INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE EXPANSION OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE PASSAGE OF PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL REFORMS. USING A UNIQUE DATASET OF MORE THAN 100 NATION STATES, I FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STATE INTERVENTION ON RELIGION ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM INFERIOR GOVERNANCE AS REFLECTED BY HIGHER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND LOWER LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW ENTRENCHMENT, BUREAUCRATIC EFFECTIVENESS, AND REGULATORY QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, STATES WHEREIN THERE IS NO DISTINCT SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF POLITICAL OPENNESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
137	PROTEST ACTIONS HAVE BECOME POPULAR RESORTS TO DECRY BAD GOVERNANCE AND PRESS ON SOCIO-POLITICAL DEMANDS IN NIGERIA. HOWEVER, THE ATTACK AND MAIMING OF PROTESTERS, THE HIJACK OF THE PROTEST MEDIUM ALLEGEDLY BY HOODLUMS, AND THE ARREST OF PROTESTERS BY UNNAMED SECURITY AGENTS HAVE INTRODUCED DOUBTS AS TO THE POTENCY OF THE PROTEST MEDIUM IN EFFECTING DESIRED SOCIO-POLITICAL CHANGE. UNDERSTANDING THE MOTIVATIONS FOR PROTEST ACTIONS THROUGH THE GRIEVANCE THEORY AND LEANING ON MARXISM, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND EXPLOITATION THAT TRIGGERS PROTESTS AND THE FATE OF THE CITIZENRY IN THE FACE OF LETHAL OPPOSITION TO PROTESTS AS REPRESENTED IN ARASE'S IN MY COUNTRY (2017) AND SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA (2011). WE SUBMIT THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE THROUGH PROTEST AND REVOLT REQUIRES PATRIOTISM, WILLFUL SPIRIT, SACRIFICE, AND COURAGE. OPTIMAL REGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS TO PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY AND PROTEST IS RECOMMENDED.
138	THIS ARTICLE SCRUTINIZES RECENT HISTORIES OF COLONIAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT USE METROPOLITAN REACTIONS TO THE 'SCANDALS OF EMPIRE' TO PROJECT A REFORM-ORIENTED VERSION OF EUROPEAN COLONIALISM. IN FRENCH WEST AFRICA, MOST SCANDALS NEVER REACHED THE LEVEL OF METROPOLITAN DEBATE; THEY HIT DEAD ENDS IN COLONIAL BUREAUCRACIES. ANALYZING ONE DEAD-END SCANDAL, THE M'PESOBA AFFAIR, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT COLONIAL JUSTICE ON THE GROUND OFTEN ADHERED TO A POLITICS OF EXPEDIENCY, NOT A REFORMIST RULE OF LAW. TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRECARIOUS GRIP ON POWER, COLONIAL ADMINISTRATORS HAD TO SIMULTANEOUSLY APPEASE THEIR SUPERIORS, ECONOMIC INTERESTS, AND POWERFUL AFRICAN ACTORS. RESOLVING THE M'PESOBA AFFAIR, FOR ONE, ENTAILED NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX ENTANGLEMENTS OF COTTON PRODUCTION, CHIEFLY DISPUTES, ISLAMIC POLICY, AND INTERRACIAL SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS IN A BACKWATER OF EMPIRE MARKED BY ANTICOLONIAL REVOLT AND WORLD WAR. ESPECIALLY IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS, POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS SHAPED THE APPLICATION OF JUSTICE.
139	RUSSIA'S FULL-SCALE INVASION OF UKRAINE CREATED A NEW MOMENTUM FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION TO REVIEW ITS POLITICAL AND SECURITY STRATEGY FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. ITS ENLARGEMENT POLICY - WHICH HAS BECOME YET ANOTHER DIVISIVE ISSUE IN EUROPE OVER THE PAST YEARS - IS NOW FORCED BACK INTO THE EU'S FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES. WITH UKRAINE, GEORGIA, AND MOLDOVA OFFICIALLY REQUESTING MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU, DECIDING HOW TO GO ABOUT IT HAS BECOME AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE. OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, WE HAVE EVIDENCED A FAILURE OF THE EU TO SHOW RESULTS IN THE WESTERN BALKANS - BOTH IN TERMS OF DRIVING DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS IN DELIVERING ON ITS PROMISES IN THE ACCESSION PROCESS. THE WAR IN UKRAINE MIGHT BE THE EU'S LAST CHANCE TO REINVIGORATE ITS ENLARGEMENT POLICY AND REPOSITION ITSELF GEOPOLITICALLY IN EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE.
140	THE TERM "NEW WARS" IS OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE HOW TERRORIST GROUPS ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO THE "CLASSIC" MEANS OF INTERVENTION BY STATES. TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS USE ASYMMETRIC METHODS OF WARFARE TO TARGET THE WEAKNESSES OF WESTERN STATES. CONSEQUENTLY, CONVENTIONAL WARS HAVE ALSO CHANGED INTO HYBRID WARS. THE LEGAL STATUS OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE RULE OF LAW. IN RESPONDING TO TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CRIME AND TERRORISM IS DIFFICULT. THE "WAR ON TERROR" IS GOVERNED BY DIFFERENT RULES AND PRINCIPLES AND IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO WAGE. CONFLICTS LAST A LONG TIME AND VICTORY AGAINST TERRORISM IS RARELY POSSIBLE DUE TO THE NETWORKED STRUCTURE OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND THE WAY THEY INTERMINGLE WITH THE POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO AN ALLIANCE-WIDE APPROACH, THERE IS A NATIONAL SOLUTION TO ANSWER THESE NEW THREATS IN FORM OF THE COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL DEFENSE IN AUSTRIA.
141	IN PRINCIPLE, THE 2007 AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE (ACDEG) COULD BE A POWERFUL INSTRUMENT TO BRING THE AFRICAN GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE TO LIFE AND TO HELP ENSURE THAT ITS UNIVERSAL VALUES, INCLUDING RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS ALL AFRICAN UNION MEMBER STATES. YET HOW SERIOUS IN REALITY ARE THE LATTER ON THIS QUESTION? RATIFICATION OF THE AFRICAN CHARTER HAS TAKEN FIVE YEARS AND, AS OF LATE 2019, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS COMPLIANCE MECHANISM IS STILL PENDING. THIS ARTICLE ASKS HOW THESE EMPIRICAL PUZZLES CAN BE BEST ADDRESSED. IN THE ABSENCE OF ROBUST DATA ON MEMBER STATES' PREFERENCES AND WITH A VIEW TO DEVELOPING HYPOTHESES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH, THIS ARTICLE INDUCTIVELY INTERROGATES HOW DATA ON THE VARIOUS REGIMES' POLITICAL LIBERTIES MAY OR MAY NOT RELATE TO THE RATIFICATION OF THE AFRICAN CHARTER AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACDEG COMPLIANCE MECHANISM.
142	TAX EVASION LIES AT THE CORE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS AND THE STATE: IT REFLECTS THE LEVEL OF TRUST IN THE STATE AND COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIETY'S IMPLICIT SOCIAL CONTRACT. HOWEVER, EMPIRICALLY ANALYZING TAX EVASION IS CHALLENGING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW DIRECT AND RELIABLE MEASURES. WE CONDUCT LIST EXPERIMENTS ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF HOUSEHOLDS TO ESTIMATE HOW FREQUENTLY CONSUMERS ARE WILLING TO BE COMPLICIT IN VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) EVASION, AS WELL AS THE EXTENT OF SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS IN RESPONDENT ANSWERS. AROUND 20 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS AGREE TO MAKE PURCHASES WITHOUT A RECEIPT IN ORDER TO AVOID PAYING VAT; SURPRISINGLY, THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED TO ADMIT THIS OPENLY. EVASION IS MORE PREVALENT IN PLACES WITH MORE INFORMALITY AND LESS PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE STATE, AS WELL AS AMONG POORER, LESS EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WHO DISREGARD THE RULE OF LAW.
143	THE PROCESS OF APPLYING THE LAW TENDS TO OSCILLATE BETWEEN TWO MODES: THE SUBSUMPTION UNDER "CLEAR" RULES ON THE ONE HAND AND THE INTERPRETATIVE CONCRETISATION OF VAGUE AND ABSTRACT BLANKET CLAUSES ON THE OTHER. LEGAL ARGUMENTS THEREFORE REFER BOTH TO THE SEMANTIC CONTENT OF RULES AND TO LEGAL SELF-EVIDENCE. CONSEQUENTLY THE APPLICATION OF LAW CAN EFFECTIVELY BE INFLUENCED NOT ONLY THROUGH NEW LEGISLATION, BUT ALSO THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW INTERPRETERS BRINGING WITH THEM A DIFFERENT SET OF PRECONCEPTIONS, AND THUS DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW. THE TRADITIONAL BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO MODELS OF CONTROL IS ENDANGERED IN MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES SINCE THESE SOCIETIES ARE CHARACTERISED BY CONFLICTING CONCEPTS OF JUSTICE. AN AUTOMATED APPLICATION OF LAW, ASPIRED TO BY MANY LEGAL SCHOLARS, COULD DISPENSE LEGAL PRACTICE FROM SUCH CONFLICTING PREJUDICES. THE PRICE FOR THAT GAIN, HOWEVER, WOULD LIKELY BE A LOSS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING.
144	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE PERCEPTION OF THE RESPONDENTS IN MONTENEGRO, SERBIA AND BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA REGARDING THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITY AND THE DEFICIT OF BASIC SELECTED FACTORS THAT HAVE A PREDOMINANT IMPACT ON IT. IT USES AND EXPLAINS THE CONDITIONAL NOTION OF INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITY AS A SPECIFIC FORM OF BOUNDED ECONOMIC RATIONALITY. IT STARTS FROM THE BASIC HYPOTHESIS THAT DURING THE LONG-LASTING TRANSITION PROCESS THERE WERE FOUR GROUPS OF INHIBITORS TO THE INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITY IN THE MENTIONED COUNTRIES (RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONS, CIVIL SOCIETY AND OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOR), THE REASON BEING THEIR DEFICIENCY (UNDERDEVELOPMENT). FROM THE BASIC HYPOTHESIS, AN AUXILIARY ONE ARISES - THAT OVERCOMING THE DEFICIT OF THE MENTIONED INHIBITORS WOULD HAVE A DIRECT AND DECISIVE IMPACT ON THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL RATIONALITY, AND THUS, THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS IS EXPERIMENTALLY PROOFED THROUGHOUT APPROPRIATE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS.
145	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE ORIGINS OF INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) TREATIES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN SOCIAL CONTRACT. THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDES HOW AND WHY ISDS EMERGED IN NAFTA, WAS REBUFFED WITH THE FAILURE OF THE MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT (MAI), AND BECAME INCORPORATED INTO MOST SUBSEQUENT BILATERAL US TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS. THE PAPER CONSIDERS AUSTRALIA'S EXPOSURE TO ISDSFIRST THROUGH USING IT IN BILATERAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS IN NATIONS WITH INADEQUATE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW, THEN TURNING AGAINST IT WHEN A MULTINATIONAL TOBACCO COMPANY TRIED TO USE THE MECHANISM TO OVERTURN SCIENTIFICALLY ENDORSED, DEMOCRATICALLY APPROVED AND CONSTITUTIONALLY VALIDATED TOBACCO PLAIN PACKAGING MEASURES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY EXPLORING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNANCE VISION CAN BE ACHIEVED IN WHICH THE SYSTEM OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION AND TRADE LAW IS MADE COHERENT WITH PRESUMPTIVELY MORE DEMOCRATICALLY LEGITIMATE NORMATIVE SYSTEMS SUCH AS CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW.
146	THIS IS AN INTERROGATION INTO WHAT AN INTERNATIONAL(IZED) COURT CAN HOLD. EXPRESSIVISM TEACHES US THAT BY TRYING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR MASS LOSSES, CRIMINAL COURTS SEND MORAL MESSAGES ON THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY ATTACHMENTS. IN THIS PERFORMANCE OF RITUALIZED GRIEF AND CONDEMNATION, THE COURT MUST HOLD THE VICTIM: THE DEAD VICTIM WHO REMAINS IN IMAGES INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COURT; THE SURVIVING VICTIMS WHOSE DESIRE TO BEAR WITNESS STANDS IN TENSION WITH THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE LEGAL PROCESS IN VICTIM PARTICIPATION; AND THE COMMUNITIES WHOSE VICTIMIZATION IS THE COURT'S FOCUS AS THEY ARE ENGAGED THROUGH OUTREACH PROGRAMS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I QUESTION WHETHER EXPRESSIVISM IS A VIABLE RATIONALE FOR INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW BY EXAMINING VICTIM APPEARANCE AT THE EXTRAORDINARY CHAMBERS IN THE COURTS OF CAMBODIA. I ARGUE THAT EXPRESSIVISM RELIES ON SIMPLIFIED REPRESENTATIONS OF VICTIMHOOD THAT DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS VICTIMS.
147	THIS ARTICLE WILL DEMONSTRATE, VIA A SERIES OF SEVEN MUSIC-RELATED VIGNETTES GATHERED FROM ARCHIVAL RESEARCH AND ORAL HISTORY, ASPECTS OF THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESISTANCE EXPRESSED VIA "MUSICKING," AND "OFFICIAL CULTURE" EXPRESSED VIA THE USE OF FORCE, SPECTACLE, POLICY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POWER AND MUSICAL RESISTANCE IS TREATED AS A DANCE: ONE PARTNER IN THIS DANCE IS THE "CONTROLLING MECHANISM" INHERENT AND ALWAYS IMPLIED IN THE EXPRESSION OF POWER AND THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF BEHAVIOR THAT POWER ENCOMPASSES. THE OTHER PARTNER IS THE SPECTRUM OF RESISTIVE MUSICAL RESPONSES THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM BLATANT PROTEST VIA PUBLIC PERFORMATIVE "SPECTACLE," "HIDDEN RESISTANCE," ACCOMMODATIVE RESISTANCE, AND SUBTLE AND BLATANT COMPLICITY. THE MAJORITY OF THE HISTORICAL VIGNETTES COME FROM THE SUKUMA REGION OF WESTERN TANZANIA, TAKING PLACE DURING THE GERMAN AND BRITISH COLONIAL PERIODS (FROM THE LATE 19005 UP TO THE EARLY 1960S).
148	THE ARAB SPRING HAS HIGHLIGHTED ONCE MORE THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FAILURE TO BRING ABOUT DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA THROUGH ITS MEDITERRANEAN DEMOCRACY PROMOTION POLICY. HOWEVER, ARAB AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES ENGAGE TO DIFFERENT DEGREES IN COOPERATION ON DEMOCRACY PROMOTION, GIVING THE EU MORE OR LESS INFLUENCE ON DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE RELATED TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. A COMPARISON OF DOMESTIC CHANGE AND COOPERATION IN MOROCCO AND TUNISIA IN 2000-2010 SHOWS THAT THE EU HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN SUPPORTING AND POTENTIALLY REINFORCING DOMESTIC REFORM INITIATIVES. YET THE EU CANNOT TRIGGER DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE DEGREE OF POLITICAL LIBERALISATION DETERMINES THE FIT BETWEEN THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL AGENDA AND EXTERNAL DEMANDS FOR REFORMS. IT REFLECTS DIFFERENT 'SURVIVAL STRATEGIES' BETWEEN POLITICAL INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION AND IS THEREFORE A SCOPE CONDITION FOR RATHER THAN THE RESULT OF COOPERATION AND CHANGE.
149	THE FAST GROWING ANCHOR COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME KEY PLAYERS IN MITIGATING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. CHINA IS A VERY PARTICULAR ANCHOR COUNTRY. THE SIZE, SCOPE AND QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ASSOCIATED WITH ITS DRAMATIC ECONOMIC GROWTH IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT OF ALL THE OTHER ANCHOR COUNTRIES. DESPITE BEING REGARDED AS AIL ALL-EMBRACING EMERGING SUPERPOWER, CHINA IS A VERY HETEROGENEOUS COUNTRY REGARDING ITS ECONOMIC. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES REQUIRE AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. HOWEVER. CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM IS CHARACTERIZED BY A NUMBER OF WEAKNESSES, WHICH IMPEDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TARGETS AND OBJECTIVES SET BY POLICIES AND LAWS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS REFERS TO THE INSUFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL POLICY COORDINATION. GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE REQUIRES MEASURES THAT ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES. FURTHERMORE. THE DIFFUSION OF PUBLIC INFORMATION ON THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE TO BE PROMOTED AS COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES.
150	THE IMPROVEMENT OF DATA STATISTICS AS WELL AS THE ECONOMETRICIAN METHODS HAVE FACILITATED THE INTRODUCTION THE NEW VARIABLES AND FACTORS I THE ECONOMIC GROWTH ANALYSIS. IN THIS SENSE, REAL VARIABLES HAVE MAINLY BEEN CONSIDERED IN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH STUDIES, BUT NOT FINANCIAL OR RISK MANAGEMENT ASPECTS. IN THIS SENSE, IT IS INTERESTING TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND VALUE AT RISK AND THE FEED-BACK PROCESS. THE GOAL OF THE PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND THE FEED-BACK PROCESS. WE WILL CONSIDER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC GROWTH, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN CAPITAL, FISCAL POLICY AND MONETARY POLICY, AMONG OTHERS, IN OUR ANALYSIS. WE WILL ANALYZE THE THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES AND RISK AND THE EFFECTS OF RISK ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE WILL ALSO DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS CONSIDERING THE CASE OF 15 EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES.
151	CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS EXIST IN MOST OF THE CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES OF WESTEM EUROPE, AND IN ALMOST ALL THE NEW DEMOCRACIES IN EASTEM EUROPE; EVEN FRANCE HAS DEVELOPED ITS CONSEIL CONSTITUTIONNEL INTO A GENUINE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION. WHILE THEIR EMERGENCE MAY BE REGARDED AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IMPROVEMENTS ON TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, IT HAS INEVITABLY GIVEN RISE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER AT THE SUPREME JUDICIAL LEVEL. AS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW HAS COME TO PERMEATE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IT HAS BECOME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A FIRM DELIMITATION BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THOSE OF ORDINARY COURTS. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT VARIOUS CONFLICTS ARISING BETWEEN THE HIGHER COURTS OF GERMANY, ITALY, POLAND, AND FRANCE, AND CONCLUDES THAT, IN BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LAWMAKING, CERTAIN TENSIONS ARE BOUND TO EXIST AS A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF CENTRALIZED JUDICIAL REVIEW.
152	PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST IMMIGRANT YOUTHS IN THE GERMAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON THE EARLY STAGES OF THE CRIMINALIZATION PROCESS. MOST AUTHORS ASSUME THAT DISCRIMINATION IS FOUND WHEN GERMANS REPORT CRIMES TO THE POLICE AS WELL AS IN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS, WHEREAS IT IS ASSUMED THAT PUBLIC PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND EXHIBIT LITTLE DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR. YET, THE NOTION OF THE FORMAL BLINDNESS OF JUSTICE THAT IS AT THE CORE OF SUCH REASONING IS NOT TENABLE AS FAR AS CRIMINAL LAW IS CONCERNED, AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF JUVENILE COURT CASES DEMONSTRATES THAT IMMIGRANT YOUTHS FROM TURKEY AND, POSSIBLY, ALSO FROM (FORMER) YUGOSLAVIA RECEIVE HARSHER TREATMENT THAN DO GERMAN YOUTHS. THE PUBLIC DEBATE, WHICH IS LARGELY RESTRICTED TO THE PROBLEM OF ''IMMIGRANT CRIME'' SHOULD BE ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NON-GERMANS BY THE COURTS.
153	THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY (EAC) IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA. DUE TO THE FOUNDING TREATY'S COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND TO ACHIEVING OF A POLITICAL FEDERATION, ONE MAY THINK THAT THE EAC HAS A POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE THE IDEAS OF TRANSFORMATIVE AFRICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE PARTICIPATING STATES. HOWEVER, THE HISTORY OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN EAST AFRICA, THE EAC'S CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL SET-UP AND ITS SUBSTANTIVE LAW TELL A DIFFERENT STORY. THE ORGANIZATION'S ELITIST LEGACY AND AN INTEGRATION MODEL DEPENDING ON THE GOODWILL OF THE HEADS OF STATE DO NOT FULLY DELIVER ON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH THE TREATY PRONOUNCES. IT IS THE PRO-ACTIVE STANCE TAKEN BY THE EAST AFRICAN COURT OF JUSTICE (EACJ) AND TO SOME EXTENT ALSO BY THE EAST AFRICAN LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY (EALA) THAT KEEPS THE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE HOPES OF EAST AFRICANS ALIVE.
154	THE EU IS, IN FORMAL TERMS, A UNION OF STATES FOUNDED ON THE VALUES OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND VALUES. THE VALUE OF THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF EUROPEAN SOCIETIES IS THUS QUESTIONED BY RADICAL VOICES THAT ENDEAVOUR TO DISSEMINATE DISCORD AND FRAGMENTATION BETWEEN AND WITHIN MS. BOTH POLICY MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS ARGUE FOR A NEED TO DEVELOP INTERCULTURAL AND DEMOCRATICALLY COMPETENT TEACHERS WHO ARE CAPABLE OF BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE POLITICS OF BELONGING AND THE INDIVIDUAL??S EXPRESSION OF BELONGING. THE FOLLOWING PAPER ANALYSES THREE INTERNATIONAL FLAGSHIP COMPETENCE FRAMEWORKS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERCULTURAL COMPETENCE. IT ARGUES FOR A NEED IN SHIFTING THE APPROACH IN TEACHERS EDUCATION ION FOR ADDRESSING CULTURAL DIVERSITY CHOOSING THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE RFCDC FRAMEWORK AS THE OPTIMAL CHOICE FOR TEACHER EDUCATION TOWARDS A NEW PARADIGM OF INTERCULTURAL AND DEMOCRATIC COMPETENCE.
155	FOCUSING ON THE DISCRETIONARY POWER TO AMEND AN ASSESSMENT AT ANY TIME WHERE THE COMMISSIONER IS 'OF THE OPINION THERE HAS BEEN FRAUD OR EVASION', THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE INCREASINGLY PREVALENT PRACTICE IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF SUMMARILY DISMISSING JUDICIAL REVIEW APPLICATIONS NOT ALLEGING EITHER OF THE TWO JURISDICTIONAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED BY THE PLURALITY IN FEDERAL COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION V FUTURIS CORPORATION LTD IS BOTH APOCRYPHAL AND REPUGNANT TO THE RULE OF LAW. AS WILL BE SHOWN, THE CURRENT PRACTICE, TOGETHER WITH THE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS INHERING IN THE STATUTORY SCHEME FOR OVERTURNING AN EXCESSIVE ASSESSMENT, COMBINE TO RENDER THE TAX PRACTICALLY INCONTESTABLE, IN TURN REDUCING CONFIDENCE IN THE TAX SYSTEM AND STRIKING AN UNFAIR BALANCE BETWEEN PRESERVING THE CAPACITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE TO COLLECT LEGITIMATE INCOME TAX LIABILITIES AND TAXPAYERS' RIGHT TO PETITION COURTS TO OVERTURN AN ASSESSMENT PURPORTEDLY MADE BEYOND POWER.
156	THIS ARTICLE REAPPRAISES THE POLITICAL IDEAS OF WILLIAM MANNING, AND THROUGH HIM THE TRAJECTORY OF EARLY MODERN REPUBLICANISM. MANNING, AN EARLY AMERICAN FARMER WRITING IN THE 1780S AND 1790S, DEVELOPED THE REPUBLICAN DISTINCTION BETWEEN "THE IDLE FEW" AND "THE LABORING MANY" INTO A NOVEL "POLITICAL THEORY OF THE DEPENDENT CLASSES." CM THIS THEORY IT IS THE DEPENDENT; LABORING CLASSES WHO SHARE AN INTEREST IN SOCIAL EQUALITY. BECAUSE OF THIS INTEREST, THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN REPUBLICAN LIBERTY WITH THIS IDENTIFICATION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE DEPENDENT CLASSES WITH THE COMMON GOOD, MANNING INVERTED INHERITED REPUBLICAN IDEAS, AND TRANSFORMED THE LANGUAGE OF LIBERTY AND VIRTUE INTO ONE OF THE FIRST POTENT, REPUBLICAN CRITIQUES OF EXPLOITATION. AS SUCH, HE STANDS AS A KEY FIGURE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE SHIFT IN EARLY MODERN REPUBLICANISM FROM A CONCERN WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW TO THE SOCIAL QUESTION.
157	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER THE RATIONALE FOR LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE APPLIES TO CORPORATIONS. IT EXAMINES THE RATIONALE FOR LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COURT OF APPEAL AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN THE THREE RIVERS LITIGATION, AND ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW RATIONALE FOR ADVICE PRIVILEGE ENDORSED BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS IS BASED LARGELY ON THE NEEDS AND BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS. THE PAPER EXAMINES THE CASE FOR RECOGNISING ADVICE PRIVILEGE FOR CORPORATIONS. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CORPORATE LAW AND GOVERNANCE, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO DIRECTORS' DUTIES, HAVE ARGUABLY REDUCED THE NEED FOR A CORPORATE PRIVILEGE. PUBLIC AND LARGE PRIVATE COMPANIES IN PARTICULAR ALREADY HAVE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES TO OBTAIN ACCURATE LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT THEIR AFFAIRS EVEN WITHOUT A PRIVILEGE. THERE ARE ALSO SOUND POLICY REASONS FOR RESTRICTING THE RIGHT OF CORPORATIONS TO CLAIM LEGAL ADVICE PRIVILEGE GIVEN ITS COSTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
158	COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF DEMOCRATIZATION HAVE PRODUCED TWO TYPES OF GENERALIZATIONS: THOSE HAVING NEARLY UNIVERSAL APPLICATION AND THOSE APPLYING TO A RANGE OF COUNTRIES WITHIN A REGION. IN THE FIRST CATEGORY ARE SUCH ARGUMENTS AS THE ROLE OF HIGH LEVELS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN GUARANTEEING DEMOCRATIC SUSTAINABILITY, THE CENTRALITY OF POLITICAL ELITES IN ESTABLISHING AND TERMINATING DEMOCRACY, AND DEFICITS IN RULE OF LAW AND STATE CAPACITY AS THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE TO THE QUALITY AND SURVIVAL OF NEW DEMOCRACIES. IN THE SECOND CATEGORY ARE CONTRASTS BETWEEN RECENT DEMOCRATIZATION IN POST-SOCIALIST EUROPE VERSUS LATIN AMERICA AND SOUTHERN EUROPE-FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRATIZATION AND ECONOMIC REFORM AND IN THE COSTS AND BENEFITS FOR DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION OF BREAKING QUICKLY VERSUS SLOWLY WITH THE AUTHORITARIAN PAST. THE TWO SETS OF CONCLUSIONS HAVE IMPORTANT METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW COMPARATIVISTS UNDERSTAND GENERALIZABILITY AND THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON HISTORICAL VERSUS PROXIMATE CAUSATION.
159	THERE ARE TWO CONTEMPORARY THEORIES ON HOW JUDGES SHOULD GO ABOUT APPLYING THE LAW. ONE IS A RULES-BASED APPROACH, WHICH HOLDS THAT EVEN FACTUALLY COMPELLING CLAIMS SHOULD BE REJECTED IF ACCEPTING THEM WOULD CONFLICT WITH STRICT APPLICATION OF THE LEGAL RULE IN QUESTION. THE OTHER IS AN EQUITY-BASED APPROACH, WHICH HOLDS THAT JUDGES SHOULD DECIDE CASES ACCORDING TO STANDARDS OF ''ENLIGHTENED DECENCY'' EVEN IF THE RESULT IS THE CREATION OF NUMEROUS EXCEPTIONS TO A RULE'S PLAIN MEANING. IN THIS ARTICLE, JUDGE WILKINSON PROPOSES A PRACTICAL THIRD ALTERNATIVE: A JURISPRUDENCE OF PRESUMPTIONS. THIS APPROACH RECOGNIZES THE INHERENT VALUE OF RULES, BUT PROPOSES THAT THE STRICT DICTATES OF RULES BE UNDERSTOOD AS SUSCEPTIBLE TO REBUTTAL UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. A PRESUMPTIONS ANALYSIS MITIGATES THE HARSHER APPLICATIONS OF THE RULES-BASED APPROACH YET MAINTAINS THE INTEGRITY OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT MAY BE LOST IN A PURE EQUITY-BASED JURISPRUDENCE.
160	THE CLASSIC LEGAL APPROACH TO LEGISLATIVE OUSTER CLAUSES IN THE COMMON LAW WAS ARTICULATED BY THE HOUSE OF LORDS IN ANISMINIC LTD. V. FOREIGN COMPENSATION COMMISSION. HOWEVER, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SINGAPORE INDICATE A JUDICIAL DESIRE TO SHIFT AWAY FROM THAT APPROACH TOWARDS A MORE FLEXIBLE ANALYSIS OF AN OUSTER CLAUSE'S EFFECT, CENTERED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE PARALLEL DEVELOPMENTS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE STARKLY DIFFERING CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS SHAPING THE APPROACH TO OUSTER CLAUSES IN THE TWO JURISDICTIONS. CAPITALIZING ON THESE TRENDS, IT PROPOSES A COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE MATERIALITY OF VARIOUS MICROCONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS IN OUSTER CLAUSE ANALYSIS IN THE TWO JURISDICTIONS-CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DECISION-MAKER-AND INQUIRES INTO THE NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS IN EACH JURISDICTION OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUSTER CLAUSE DOCTRINE.
161	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROXIES BY TOTAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY (TEA) REDUCES POVERTY IN 122 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2006-2016. WE USE THREE MEASURES OF POVERTY POVERTY GAP AT $1.90 A DAY (2011 PPP) (%), POVERTY HEADCOUNT RATIO AT $1.90 A DAY (2011 PPP) (% OF POPULATION) AND POVERTY GAP AT NATIONAL POVERTY LINES (%). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE TEA HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ALL MEASURES OF POVERTY. THE PICTURE REMAINS SIMILAR WHEN THE COUNTRIES ARE DISPATCHED BY LEVELS OF INCOME. HOWEVER, WHEN WE CONSIDER THE 2008'S FINANCIAL CRISIS EFFECT, THE IMPACT OF TEA ON POVERTY REDUCTION OVER THE PERIOD 2009-2016 IS LOWER COMPARED TO THAT OF THE FULL PERIOD (2006-2016). THE FOCUS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' POLICY MAKERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED THE CREATION OF MORE ENTREPRENEURS AND ENTERPRISES IN A RULE OF LAW ENHANCING AND PROPERTY RIGHT SECURED FRAMEWORK WITH A SKILLFUL WORKFORCE.
162	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES A CLASSIC PROBLEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS THE QUEST FOR INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY IN THE PRESENCE OF BUREAUCRATIC AUTONOMY. IT DOES SO IN COMBINATION WITH A HISTORY OF IDEAS ACCOUNT OF THE SUBJECT WITH A CASE STUDY OF DERAILED AUTONOMY AT THE EXPENSE OF INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY WITH PARTICULARLY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN THE FORM OF HUMAN CASUALTIES. REFERRING TO LITERATURE ON PUBLIC VALUES AND MORAL HAZARD UNDER THE CONDITION OF BUREAUCRATIC DISCRETION, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT HARMONIZING BUREAUCRATIC AUTONOMY AND INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY REQUIRES COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC VALUES THAT PRIORITIZE THE PROTECTION OF BASIC INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OVER TEMPTATIONS OF PRAGMATIC DECISION MAKING. IT IS, THEREFORE, A PLEA FOR LINKING TRADITIONAL LINES OF THOUGHTS ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WITH A MORE FINE-GRAINED ASSESSMENT OF THE AMBIVALENCE OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AS BOTH GUARDIANS OF, AND A MENACE TO, RULE-OF-LAW-BASED PROTECTION OF CIVIC VALUES.
163	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PROVISION OF DOMICILIARY PUBLIC SERVICES IN AN EFFICIENT AND TIMELY MANNER AS A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO EXERCISE CONTROL, INSPECTION AND SURVEILLANCE OF ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE THESE PUBLIC SERVICES, THROUGH THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF DOMICILIARY PUBLIC SERVICES (ARTICLE 370, POLITICAL CONSTITUTION, 1991), WHICH IS EMPOWERED TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE RULES TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT (ARTICLE 81, LAW 142, 1998) AS A MANIFESTATION OF STATE'S INTERVENTION IN THE ECONOMY; AND IT ENDS WITH THE STUDY OF THE SCOPE OF APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS TO THE RIGHTS TO DOMICILIARY PUBLIC SERVICES, SEEN AS A LIMIT TO THE PUNITIVE POWER OF THE STATE AND AS A MECHANISM TO AVOID ARBITRARY DECISION-MAKING.
164	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (F.D.I.) BY CATEGORISING THE COUNTRIES AS DEVELOPED OR DEVELOPING. WE MEASURED INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY BY THE SUM OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW INDICATORS. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS F.D.I. IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; SPECIFICALLY, WE FIND THAT A ONE STANDARD DEVIATION CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS F.D.I. BY A FACTOR OF 0.2225 (USING COMMON LAW AND THE LAGGED VALUES OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES AS INSTRUMENTS). CETERIS PARIBUS, THE RESULTS FOR THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IMPACT IS INSIGNIFICANT BECAUSE OF THE WEAK STRUCTURE OF INSTITUTIONS. RESULT FINDINGS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN ATTRACTING F.D.I. INFLOWS. FROM OUR RESULTS, WE INFER THAT THE RELEVANCE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS TENDS TO BE A KEY POINT IN ATTRACTING F.D.I. INFLOWS.
165	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND GOVERNMENTAL QUALITY BY CONSIDERING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN A CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES. IT IS SHOWN THAT COUNTRIES WITH BOTH HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EXHIBIT HIGHER QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT AS MEASURED BY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, IMPARTIALITY, PROFESSIONALISM, AND A GOVERNMENTAL QUALITY INDEX. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT COUNTRIES WITH BOTH HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND LOW LEVELS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER GOVERNMENTAL QUALITY AS MEASURED BY PROFESSIONALISM. THESE FINDINGS QUESTION THE USE OF HETEROGENEOUS INDICATORS FOR GOVERNMENTAL QUALITY AND SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THUS, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE SOCIAL CAPITAL THEORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL QUALITIES.
166	SINCE AT LEAST 2005, MEXICO HAS CONFRONTED A SEVERE SECURITY CRISIS THAT THREATENS TO UNDERMINE ITS RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. AN EFFECTIVE POLICE RESPONSE HAS BEEN HINDERED BY FRUSTRATED CITIZENS WHO DO NOT REPORT CRIME, COME FORWARD WITH INFORMATION, SERVE AS WITNESSES, OR SUPPORT THEIR POLICE. THIS FOMENTS A VICIOUS CYCLE WHEREBY INSECURITY AND CORRUPTION FOSTER DISSATISFACTION, WHICH YIELDS FURTHER INSECURITY AND CORRUPTION. BREAKING THIS CYCLE REQUIRES A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY CITIZENS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR POLICE. ONE VIEW HOLDS THAT DISCONTENT IS DUE TO POLICE CORRUPTION, BUT A SOMEWHAT RIVAL PERSPECTIVE CONTENDS THAT CITIZENS ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH SECURITY OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY USES COMPARATIVE SURVEY DATA FROM 14 MAJOR MEXICAN CITIES TO TEST THESE POTENTIALLY RIVAL APPROACHES. IT FINDS THAT BOTH CORRUPTION AND SECURITY OUTCOMES MATTER, BUT DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH BRIBERY HAS THE SINGLE LARGEST IMPACT ON DISSATISFACTION WITH THE POLICE.
167	NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM APPEARS IN EUROPE AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. IT IS DEVELOPPED THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONS OF ITALY (1947), GERMANY (1949), PORTUGAL (1976) AND SPAIN (1978). THE EUROPEANS REALIZED THAT THE JURIDICAL MODEL BASED ON THE STATUTES, IMPOSED BY THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ACCORDING TO THE IDEAS OF ROUSSEAU, WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS. FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THE UNITED STATES IT WAS DISCOVERED IN EUROPE THE NORMATIVE FORCE OF THE CONSTITUTION. THIS CREATES A NEW MODEL OF RULE OF LAW, AS AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS STAGES, THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, AND IT PRODUCES WHAT IS CALLED THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE JURIDICAL SYSTEM, WHICH BECOMES FULLY IMBUED WITH THE IDEOLOGY OF THE CONSTITUTION. ONCE MODERN CONSTITUTIONS ARE BASED ULTIMATELY ON THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON, THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON LIES AT THE HEART OF THE JURIDICAL SYSTEM, WHICH MUST BE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE.
168	THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A DIFFERENTIAL GAME OF TAX AVOIDANCE BY MODELING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A TAXPAYER AND THE TAX AUTHORITY. THE SOLUTION TO THE GAME IS A NONCOOPERATIVE NASH THAT DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES USED BY THE TAX AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE LEGISLATION AND THE COST BORNE BY THE TAXPAYER IN TAX COMPLIANCE. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED FOR THE VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) USING A CROSS-SECTION OF ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) AND NON-OECD COUNTRIES. VAT EFFICIENCY, DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF COLLECTIONS AS A SHARE OF CONSUMPTION TO THE STATUTORY RATE, RISES THE LOWER THE VAT RATE, THE LOWER THE SHARE OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN TAX REVENUE (PROXYING FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF TAX ADMINISTRATION), THE MORE PRO-COMPETITION THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN PRODUCT MARKETS (MEASURING NON-TAX INCENTIVES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE) AND THE BETTER THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS).
169	THIS PAPER EMPLOYS AND SCRUTINIZES ASEF BAYAT'S THEORY OF [THE] 'QUIET ENCROACHMENT' OF THE 'INFORMAL PEOPLE' IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO REFLECT ON CIVILITY AND GOVERNANCE IN JAMAICA. THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT IS THAT WHILE THE PRACTICES OF THE ECONOMICALLY DISPOSSESSED REPRESENT RATIONAL WAYS TO SURVIVE HARDSHIPS AND IMPROVE THEIR LIVES, THE ALLIANCE OF MEMBERS OF JAMAICA'S INFORMAL SPHERE WITH 'COMMUNITY DONS' FLIES IN THE FACE OF CIVILITY AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, ENGENDERING DESTRUCTIVE, CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR, WHICH UNDERMINES THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO REGULATE THE SPACE AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. THE ESSAY RECOGNISES THE VALIDITY OF THE EPISODIC MOBILIZATION OF 'PEOPLE ON THE MARGINS' IN JAMAICA AS A USEFUL, AUTONOMOUS ASPECT OF CIVIL SOCIETY, WITHOUT ROMANTICISING IT OR ABSTRACTING IT FROM ITS COUNTERPOINT TO THE STATE. IT HOWEVER MAINTAINS THAT SUCH A COLLECTIVITY, OPERATING VICARIOUSLY, EXERTS A BURDEN ON SOCIAL STABILITY AND COHESION WITH DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE.
170	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD REPLACING LIFETIME TENURE WITH TERM LIMITS FOR FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING U.S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. WE EMPLOY NOVEL DATA THAT WE COLLECTED FROM A NATIONWIDE SURVEY EXPERIMENT. WE FIND THAT ALTHOUGH PARTISANS ARE LESS SUPPORTIVE OF PROPOSALS FROM THEIR OPPONENTS, THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS EFFECT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN TODAY'S POLARIZED ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO FIND THAT A RESPONDENT'S SUPPORT FOR TERM LIMITS IS A FUNCTION OF HIS OR HER SUBJECTIVE IDEOLOGICAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT. FINALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT ALTHOUGH SUPPORT FOR TERM LIMITS IS GENERALLY HIGH, ONLY A MODEST SUBSET OF REFORM SUPPORTERS BELIEVE THAT TERM LIMITS SHOULD BE A TOP POLITICAL PRIORITY. THESE SUPPORTERS ALSO TEND TO EXHIBIT WEAKER LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW MORE GENERALLY. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF AN ISSUE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE.
171	THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW STUDY WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT THE SAME TIME PATIENTS IN FORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES, AND PARTIES IN RECURRING MENTAL HEALTH LAW PROCEEDINGS (MHLPS). WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ISSUES WITH THE RULE OF LAW THAT CAN ARISE WHEN MHLPS PRIORITIZE CONCERN FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE PATIENT OVER THE STRINGENT TEST OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF THE PARTY, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO BRING TO THE FORE THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS IT PRESENTS IN TERMS OF DISTRESS TO PATIENTS. DRAWING ON QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW ANALYSES, WE UNTANGLE THE APPARENT PARADOX OF MHLPS BEING DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE AS BOTH GUIDED BY CONCERN FOR PATIENTS'/PARTIES' MENTAL WELL-BEING AND AS DISTRESSING. WE TENTATIVELY RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER MHLPS MIGHT RISK BEING DISTRESSING TO THE PATIENT/PARTY, NOT DESPITE OF BUT IN PART BECAUSE OF COURT ACTORS' EFFORTS TO THE CONTRARY.
172	THE "PUTIN CONSTITUTION" OF 2020 IS A WATERSHED. IT MARKS THE END OF A PERIOD THAT BEGAN WITH PERESTROIKA, INCLUDED THE UPHEAVAL OF THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION, AND WHICH IN 1993 LED TO THE APPROVAL OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. ACCORDING TO THIS CONSTITUTION RUSSIA WAS A DEMOCRACY AND A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW THAT GUARANTEED HUMAN AND BASIC RIGHTS. THE REALITY WAS DIFFERENT. THE SOVIET LEGACY, AND ERRORS MADE DURING THE YELTSIN ERA, MADE IT HARDER TO ESTABLISH A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY. AFTER PUTIN BECAME PRESIDENT, THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY WIDENED. YET FOR TWO DECADES, THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP UPHELD THE ILLUSION OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. THIS HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO AN END. THE NEW CONSTITUTION REINFORCES INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITARIANISM AND PRESIDENTIAL ABSOLUTISM. THE LEGACY OF 1993 HAS BEEN DESTROYED.
173	IN SEEKING TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION, SAUDI ARABIA FACES CHALLENGES IN TRANSITIONING FROM A RENTIER ECONOMY TO A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS, A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC PLANS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A SOUND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM FOREIGN INVESTMENTS AND THE OUTCOME OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE ISSUES THAT HINDER THE COUNTRY FROM REACHING THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION TARGETED BY PREVIOUS PLANS. IT THEN PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY THE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE THAT CAN HELP SAUDI ARABIA TO BUILD AN EFFECTIVE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS A MEANS TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDY'S FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF ENHANCING PUBLIC SECTOR PRODUCTIVITY, FIGHTING CORRUPTION, AND ENABLING RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEMS AS KEY FACTORS IN CREATING A QUALITY KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SAUDI ARABIA.
174	THE CONCEPTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP OF THE PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AGENDA OVER THE LAST DECADE. GOOD GOVERNANCE IS SEEN AS A CENTRAL FACTOR IN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER WAS TO ANALYSE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT AND PREDICTING VARIABLES INCLUDING GDP PER CAPITA, HDI, GOVERNMENT SPENDING, ACCOUNTABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL, POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. A QUANTITATIVE ECONOMETRIC MODELLING METHODOLOGY WAS UTILIZED FOR THE DETERMINATION OF LONG AND SHORT-RUN RELATIONSHIPS USING AN ARDL MODEL. ALTHOUGH A LONGRUN RELATIONSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED, OF MORE IMPORTANCE WAS THE SHORT-RUN CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP. IT WAS FOUND THAT IN MOST CASES, EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE CAUSES CHANGES IN THE OTHER VARIABLES IN THE MODEL. EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT LEADS TO STRONG PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, AS WELL AS THE LITERATURE REVIEW, INDICATE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
175	AUTHORITARIAN RESPONSES TO RISING VIOLENT CRIME RATES HAVE BECOME A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN CENTRAL AMERICA. INSPIRED BY THEORIES OF AGENDA SETTING AND MEDIA FRAMING, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF NEWS MEDIA COVERAGE OF CRIME ON ATTITUDES TOWARD CRIME CONTROL. USING AN ORIGINAL SURVEY EXPERIMENT, IT TESTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIME NEWS, FEAR OF CRIME, TRUST IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, AND SUPPORT FOR AUTHORITARIAN CRIME CONTROL MEASURES IN GUATEMALA. IT FINDS THAT CRIME NEWS INFLUENCES SUPPORT FOR AUTHORITARIAN CRIME CONTROL VIA ITS EFFECT ON LOWERING CITIZEN TRUST IN GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. EXPOSURE TO CRIME NEWS ALSO AFFECTS SELF-REPORTED VICTIMIZATION RATES AND LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PROMOTING IRON FIST POLICIES. THESE FINDINGS NOT ONLY GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CRIME NEWS AND POLITICAL ATTITUDES BUT ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE POLITICS OF CRIME IN NEW OR FRAGILE DEMOCRACIES.
176	THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) BOASTS ONE OF THE STRONGEST OVERSIGHT SYSTEMS IN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, BUT IMPLEMENTING THE ECTHR'S RULINGS IS AN INHERENTLY DOMESTIC AND POLITICAL PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE COURT IN STRASBOURG AND THE DOMESTIC PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE COURT'S RULINGS BY LOOKING AT THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS AND POLITICS THAT SURROUND THE EXECUTION OF THE ECTHR'S JUDGMENTS. USING CASE STUDIES FROM THE UK AND RUSSIA, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES TWO FACTORS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE DOMESTIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COURT'S RULINGS: STRONG DOMESTIC, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DEDICATED TO IMPLEMENTING THE ECTHR'S JUDGMENTS AND AN OVERARCHING SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE AT HOME AND ABROAD FOR RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE STEPS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECTHR'S RULINGS.
177	OUR TIMES ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED, AND NOT VERY FAR FROM REALITY, AS EMERGENCY TIMES. THE CHALLENGES WHICH OUR SOCIETIES FACE SEEM TO DEMAND RESPONSES FAR BEYOND THE LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED IN THE FRAME OF THE RULE OF LAW. CARL SCHMITT LIVED AND WROTE IN THE MIDST OF A DARK AGE; HIS REFLECTIONS FUNCTIONED BOTH AS A WARNING ABOUT THE WEAKNESSES AND OMINOUS TRAITS PENDING UPON THE WEIMAR POLITICS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY AS AN INVITATION TO ASSUME A MUCH MORE FORCEFUL STRATEGY COPING WITH THE THREATS WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE LIBERAL REGIMES. THE REMEDIES PROPOSED INCLUDED EXTRAORDINARY EXECUTIVE POWERS, REINFORCED SOVEREIGNTY AND EVEN DICTATORSHIP. IN THIS ESSAY WE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE MAIN HINTS IN THIS ROAD TO AUTHORITARIANISM, EXAMINING THE LINKS BETWEEN SEVERAL CORE CONCEPTS OF CARL SCHMITT'S THEORETICAL PROPOSAL: SOVEREIGNTY, POWER AND EXCEPTION.
178	THIS BRIEF CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE CONCERNING GLOBAL LAW DRAWS ON THE AUTHORS' ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE. IT ARGUES THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW IS IN FACT CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL JUSTICE IN THE AFTERMATH OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES REMAINS TO BE SEEN. IN PARTICULAR, THE SMOOTH RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW AND THE PERCEPTION OF JUSTICE CAN BE CALLED INTO QUESTION, AS IT RELIES TOO HEAVILY ON THE IDEA THAT GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF WESTERNIZED FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW WILL AUTOMATICALLY INCULCATE A SENSE OF JUSTICE IN VICTIMIZED POPULATIONS, WHILE EN PASSANT CONTRIBUTING TO THE RESURRECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE CONNECTION TO BROADER ISSUES IN GLOBAL JUSTICE AND GLOBAL LAW WILL DRAW HEAVILY ON AMARTYA SEN'S RECENT CRITIQUE OF JOHN RAWLS' THEORY OF JUSTICE, IN WHICH THE FORMER EMPLOYS THE ANCIENT SANSKRIT NOTIONS OF NITI AND NYAYA.
179	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL SITUATION IN BOLIVIA. A COUNTRY WITH TRADITIONAL GOVERNANCE PROBLEMS, MARKED BY A SHARP DECLINE IN THE PRESTIGE AND AUTHORITY OF THE STATE, THE WEAKENING OF AN ALREADY DEBILITATED RULE OF LAW, THE COLLAPSE OF TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES, INCREASED ETHNIC AND REGIONAL TENSION AND A CLASH BETWEEN RIVAL VISIONS OF BOLIVIA'S FUTURE THAT DIFFER FUNDAMENTALLY. THE GOVERNMENT OF EVO MORALES SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMERGE FROM THE CRISIS AND REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE TO LEGITIMATE STATE AUTHORITY DURING THE PAST TUMULTUOUS YEARS, REBUILD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND CONGRESS, BROADEN EFFORTS AT IMPROVING MUNICIPAL AND DEPARTMENTAL GOVERNMENT, AND BEGIN A LONG OVERDUE EFFORT TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT AND FIGHT CORRUPTION. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS WAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM CLAIMED YEARS AGO BY HIS RELATED GROUPS, BUT THIS PROCESS HAS BECOME A REAL DISASTER.
180	THIS PAPER IS ABOUT THE USE OF SOCIAL HIERARCHIES AS TOOLS TO CONTROL SOCIETY IN EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DURING THE COMMUNIST ERA, AND WHY THOSE REGIMES WERE SO STABLE. ACCORDING TO THE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE DEVELOPED IN THIS ARTICLE THE CONSTRUCTIVIST SYSTEM INSTITUTED A SOCIALIST LEGAL ORDER AS A MEANS TO PRETEND THAT THE "RULE OF LAW" WAS STILL APPLICABLE. THE RESULTING CONSTRUCTIVIST REGIMES WERE PARTY-STATES, WHERE ALL STATE HIERARCHIES HAD PARALLEL STRUCTURES WITHIN THE COMMUNIST PARTY HIERARCHY, AND WHERE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS WAS REPLACED WITH A "HIERARCHIC BALANCING," A SPECIAL FORM OF LEADERSHIP THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY EXERTED OVER ALL INSTITUTIONS OF STATE ADMINISTRATION AND THE ARMED FORCES. THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM HELPED TO DECREASE THE TRANSACTION COSTS OF GOVERNANCE, AND THUS, ACHIEVE LOYALTY TO THE SYSTEM BY PARTY MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ALIKE, AND LOYALTY TO THE LEADERSHIP WITHIN COMMUNIST PARTY.
181	LITERATURE ON URBAN SAFETY IN LATIN AMERICA IS USUALLY ANCHORED IN ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENTS RELATED BOTH TO THE DETERRENCE AND BROADENING OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS. THESE IDEAS ARE CONSISTENT WITH MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANK AND NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVES. MANY OF THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT OF LATIN AMERICAN SOCIETIES. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS A REVISION OF THESE ISSUES ACROSS THREE DIMENSIONS, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO POLICE PERFORMANCE AND THE REDUCTION OF VIOLENCE. FIRST WE MUST CONSIDER LOCALITY AND DECENTRALIZATION AS A WAY OF FOSTERING CONTAINMENT POLICIES THROUGH THE IDEA OF INTER-SUBJECTIVE LIMITED ARRANGEMENTS. SECONDLY, WE MUST CONSIDER THE LEGITIMACY GIVEN TO THE SOCIAL CONTROL SYSTEM UNDERSTOOD AS CONGRUENCE BETWEEN PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTIVE ADOPTION OF DECISIONS. THIRDLY, CITIZEN EMPOWERMENT, AS EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND REDUCTION OF ASYMMETRY IN BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONTROL IS STUDIED.
182	WHAT DOES THE LAW DEMAND WHEN IT REQUIRES CITIZENS TO CONFORM TO STANDARDS OF REASONABLENESS? I PROPOSE AND DEFEND THE VIEW THAT THE LAW SHOULD DEMAND THAT CITIZENS CONFORM THEIR BEHAVIOR TO SOME ACTUAL CONDUCT IN SOCIETY. I CONTRAST THIS IDEA AGAINST WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE "EMPTY VESSEL" VIEW OF REASONABLENESS, WHERE THE STANDARD IS UNDERSTOOD TO FUNCTION LIKE AN EMPTY VESSEL IN THE LAW, ALLOWING COURTS TO USE VARIOUS NORMS AND MORAL JUDGMENTS TO DETERMINE WHAT SEEMS REASONABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE EMPTY VESSEL ACCOUNT IS THE MORE COMMON APPROACH FOR UNDERSTANDING REASONABLENESS, BUT IT LEAVES OBSCURE WHETHER AND HOW ASSESSMENTS ABOUT APPROPRIATE CONDUCT CONNECT WITH FACTS ABOUT CITIZENS' ACTUAL CONDUCT. I ARGUE FOR A "BINOCULAR" VIEW THAT FOCUSES OUR ATTENTION ON ACTUAL PRACTICES AND THEREBY ESTABLISHES HOW THESE STANDARDS PROVIDE A STABLE GUIDE TO CONDUCT AND SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW.
183	AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY WITH THE POWER TO CONSTRAIN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES IS COMMONLY THOUGHT TO BE THE FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT OBVIOUS WHY THOSE WITH POLITICAL POWER WOULD EVER TOLERATE THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY AN INDEPENDENT COURT. I OFFER AN EXPLANATION FOR INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT IS BASED ON ONGOING POLITICAL COMPETITION BETWEEN RISK-AVERSE PARTIES. AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS A MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THESE POLITICAL COMPETITORS CAN ENFORCE MUTUAL RESTRAINT. BUT SUPPORT FOR INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL REVIEW IS SUSTAINABLE ONLY WHEN (1) THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IS SUFFICIENTLY COMPETITIVE, (2) JUDICIAL DOCTRINE IS SUFFICIENTLY MODERATE, AND (3) PARTIES ARE BOTH SUFFICIENTLY RISK AVERSE AND FORWARD LOOKING. I EMPLOY A SIMPLE FORMAL MODEL TO SHOW HOW THESE VARIABLES INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL SUSTAINABILITY OF INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND I ALSO PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARY EMPIRICAL TEST THAT CONFIRMS THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESES.
184	SINCE ITS FOUNDING, HONG KONG HAD BEEN TROUBLED WITH CORRUPTION. EVENTUALLY, THE CORRUPTION BECAME SO SERIOUS AS TO THREATEN SOME OF THE BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF SOCIETY. IN RESPONSE, THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTED AN APPROACH DIFFERENT FROM ITS PAST EFFORTS. IT CREATED AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINST CORRUPTION (ICAC), WHICH IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS. ICAC NOT ONLY ELIMINATED MUCH OF THE CORRUPTION, BUT IT SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING PUBLIC ATTITUDES. ALTHOUGH ITS POWERS ARE ENORMOUS, ICAC BY AND LARGE HAS OPERATED WITHIN THE RESTRAINTS SET FOR IT. NEVERTHELESS, ITS EXISTENCE IS A POTENTIAL DANGER. ITS POWERS COULD BE ABUSED EVEN IN A SOCIETY CHARACTERIZED BY MODERATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN A SOCIETY WHOSE LEADERS ARE LESS RESTRAINED, NO LEGAL CHANGES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OPERATE ICAC AS THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF A POLICE STATE. ITS VAST AUTHORITY THEREFORE BECOMES A DIRECT, NOT MERELY AN IMPLIED, THREAT.
185	PEACEKEEPING DURING THE COLD WAR WAS PRIMARILY, AND IN SOME CASES EXCLUSIVELY, CHARGED WITH MONITORING CEASE-FIRES. THIS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY, AS PEACE OPERATIONS EVOLVED TO INCLUDE OTHER MISSIONS (E.G., RULE OF LAW, ELECTION SUPERVISION), MANY UNDER THE RUBRIC OF PEACEBUILDING. WHAT IS LACKING IS CONSIDERATION OF HOW THE DIFFERENT MISSIONS AFFECT ONE ANOTHER, SIMULTANEOUSLY AND IN SEQUENCES. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THAT GAP BY LOOKING AT THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF MISSIONS AND THEIR SUCCESS IN THE UN ORGANIZATION MISSION IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (MONUC), WHICH WAS MANDATED TO PERFORM EIGHT DIFFERENT MISSIONS OVER A DECADE. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN EACH OF THOSE MISSIONS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER GUIDED BY THEORETICAL LOGICS BASED ON THE "SECURITY FIRST" HYPOTHESIS AND MISSION COMPATIBILITY EXPECTATIONS. EARLY FAILURE TO STEM THE VIOLENCE HAD NEGATIVE DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCES FOR LATER PEACEBUILDING MISSIONS. NEVERTHELESS, MONUC'S ELECTION SUPERVISION MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL.
186	BUILDING ON THE RULING GIVEN IN THE ARANYOSI AND CALDARARU CASE, IN GENERALSTAATSANWALTSCHAFT (CONDITIONS DE DETENTION EN HONGRIE) THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE PROVIDED SOME CLARIFICATION CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE TEST DEVELOPED IN ITS FORMER CASE LAW REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT MECHANISM, FOCUSING ON THE PROHIBITION OF INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT IN PRISON. THE AUTHOR HIGHLIGHTS THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE LENGTH OF DETENTION AND THE ASSURANCES PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THE ISSUING MEMBER STATE REGARDING DETENTION CONDITIONS AND TRIES TO ASSESS WHETHER THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE PRECEDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. FURTHERMORE, SOME WORDS ARE DEVOTED TO HOW INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN THEY ARE PROVIDED BY THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES OF A STATE WHERE A RULE OF LAW CRISIS IS TAKING PLACE.
187	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE APPROPRIATION DYNAMICS OF INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING IN BURUNDI, WITH A FOCUS ON THE PERIOD FROM 2010 TO 2015. IF INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING IS MOST COMMONLY PRESENTED (AND DEBATED) AS PRACTICES LEANING TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT CAN ALSO BE USED TOWARDS UNDEMOCRATIC ENDS. THE CENTRAL CLAIM IS THE FOLLOWING: THE (MOST) RECENT AUTHORITARIAN TREND OBSERVED IN BURUNDI'S MAIN POLITICAL FORCE IN GOVERNMENT, THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR THE DEFENCE OF DEMOCRACY -FORCES FOR THE DEFENCE OF DEMOCRACY (CNDD-FDD), DID NOT ONLY OCCUR AGAINST INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING BUT ALSO THROUGH ITS APPROPRIATION AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THROUGH SELF-REINFORCING SUBVERSION TACTICS OF APPROPRIATION. THE ARTICLE CONCEPTUALIZES THESE TACTICS, EXAMINES THE FACTORS OF EMERGENCE AND CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE, AND PRESENTS THE MAIN EXPRESSIONS ALONG THREE MAJOR EDITORIAL LINES OF INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING: PLURALIST DEMOCRACY, VIBRANT CIVIL SOCIETY AND RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
188	IN STATE OF QUEENSLAND V CONGOO [2015] HCA 17 (13 MAY 2015), THE HIGH COURT APPLIED PRINCIPLES OF EXTINGUISHMENT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF MILITARY ORDERS UNDER REG 54 OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY (GENERAL) REGULATIONS 1940 (CTH) ON THE NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THE BAR-BARRUM PEOPLE. THE COURT'S SPLIT DECISION CASTS QUESTIONS OF EXTINGUISHMENT BACK TO THE 'LEGAL JUNGLE'. AMONGST THE THICKET, THE RE-EMERGENCE OF A 'RATIONALE OF EQUALITY' CAN BE GLIMPSED IN THE STATUTORY MAJORITY'S EMPHASIS ON THE STANDARD OF 'CLEAR AND PLAIN INTENTION'. THE REQUIREMENT OF A CLEAR AND PLAIN LEGISLATIVE INTENTION TO EXPROPRIATE EXISTING PROPERTY RIGHTS WITHOUT COMPENSATION IS WELL ESTABLISHED. ON THE 800TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAGNA CARTA, ITS EXTENSION TO THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF NATIVE TITLE WOULD ACCORD WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF LAW IN C 29 THAT '[N] O FREEMAN SHALL ... BE DESSEISED. BUT BY ... THE LAW OF THE LAND'.
189	THIS PAPER (RE-) EXAMINES TWO SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT HERACLITUS' FRAGMENT 22 B 52 DK, WHICH ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE SOURCES OF CONFUSION WHEN IT COMES TO ITS INTERPRETATION: THE MEANINGS OF THE LEXICAL ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE SAYING AND THE ANCIENT TESTIMONIES THAT REFER TO IT. THE RELEVANT ANCIENT SOURCES COMMONLY RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THEME OF THE UNITY OF OPPOSITES IN THE FRAGMENT AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE FRAGMENT'S WORDING YIELDS THE SAME CONCLUSION. IT RENDERS THE SAYING AS AN ORIGINAL TAKE ON THE POPULAR SUBJECT OF THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF HUMAN EXISTENCE: THE CENTRAL PARADOX OF THE PI EPSILON SIGMA SIGMA EPSILON IOTA ALPHA-PLAYING CHILD ILLUSTRATES THE ESSENTIAL UNIFORMITY BEHIND THE APPARENT CHANGEABILITY OF THE COURSE OF HUMAN LIFE. THUS, THE FRAGMENT MAY BE SEEN AS YET ANOTHER EXPRESSION OF THE UNIVERSAL RULE OF LAW AND REGULARITY CHARACTERISTIC OF HERACLITUS' PHILOSOPHY.
190	BETH SIMMONS AND ALLISON DANNER SUGGEST THAT LOW RULE OF LAW STATES JOIN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) TO COMMIT THEMSELVES CREDIBLY TO REFRAIN FROM CRIMINAL MEANS IN FIGHTING INSURGENTS, SIGNALING AN INTEREST IN NEGOTIATIONS AND CONTRIBUTING TO PROGRESS IN PEACE PROCESSES. CONTRARY TO THEIR THESIS, UGANDA REQUESTED ICC INVOLVEMENT AS AN ASSET IN ITS MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE REBEL LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY (LRA) WITHOUT IMPROVING THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES OF ITS SECURITY FORCES. WHILE THE ICC ARREST WARRANTS DID MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE PEACE PROCESS THROUGH FURTHER ISOLATING THE LRA, THEIR IRREVOCABLE NATURE BIASED CONFLICT RESOLUTION TOWARD A MILITARY RATHER THAN A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION. TO AVOID POLITICAL MANIPULATION OR COMPLICATING PEACE PROCESSES IN THE FUTURE, PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION SHOULD BE SEEN AS PART OF A POLITICAL PROCESS INVOLVING NOT ONLY THE STATE THAT REFERS A CASE, BUT ALSO LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS.
191	THE BIOPOLITICS OF MIGRANTS IS BASED ON THE ALLOW TO ENTER-RESIDE OR EXPEL BINOMIAL. IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE DESIGNED AROUND TWO AXES: FIRST, THE CONTROL OF MIGRATION IN TERMS OF THE LABOR MARKET AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ECONOMY AND, SECONDLY, THE POLICING AND PROSECUTION OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. TO ACHIEVE THE FIRST AXIS OF THE BINOMIAL, NAMELY ALLOW TO ENTER-RESIDE, STATES DEPLLOY MECHANISMS TO CONTROL IMMIGRANTS ENVISAGED AS A PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE. STATES ALSO CREATE CONTROL-PUNISHMENT MECHANISMS FOR MIGRANTS WHO VIOLATE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRY AND RESIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY. HERE BIOPOLITICS ON MIGRATION OVERLAPS WITH, OR TAKES SHAPE THROUGH, THE EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGNTY BY THE LEVIATHAN. THE CONTROL MEASURES AND SANCTIONS THAT GOVERNMENTS APPLY TO THE UNDOCUMENTED HAVE CREATED AN POWERFUL MACHINERY OF COERCION WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE POINT OF CONVERTING IT INTO AN EXPELLING STATE.
192	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN PERUVIAN POLITICS IN THE 1990S AND THE ADVANCES MADE IN SOME AREAS OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS ARE CONNECTED TO THE STRATEGIES PUT IN PLACE BY SOME SECTORS OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT AND TO THE OPENINGS PROVIDED BY THE FUJIMORI REGIME. SOME OF THE IMPACT OF NEOPOPULIST RULE ON POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IS SHOWN TO BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO WOMEN'S INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES DURING THIS PERIOD; YET THE WEAK RULE OF LAW AND THE POLITICAL USE OF THE WOMEN'S AGENDA BY AN INCREASINGLY QUESTIONABLE REGIME PLACED THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IN A COMPLEX POLITICAL PANORAMA. A DISAGGREGATED ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICS OF WOMEN'S CITIZENSHIP REVEALS THAT WOMEN FROM THE POPULAR SECTORS DID NOT BENEFIT FROM THE SAME PROGRESS IN THEIR RIGHTS CLAIMS AS WOMEN FROM THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT OR WOMEN IN PARTY POLITICS.
193	THE CONTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS TO EASTERN EUROPE'S RECENT HISTORY IS UNDEREXAMINED AND WIDELY SEEN AS MARGINAL. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS WERE IMPORTANT FORCES IN THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND CONTINUE TO GUARD AGAINST AUTHORITARIAN DRIFT AND THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER, ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS IN 1980S POLAND ORGANISED OPPOSITION AGAINST THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP AND HELPED LAY THE GROUND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. IN 2020S SERBIA, ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS PROTESTING AGAINST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT UNDERMINE THE WELLBEING AND LIVELIHOODS OF LOCAL POPULATIONS HAVE FORMED A DEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE TO ESTABLISHED POLITICAL ELITES. BOTH CASES DEMONSTRATE THE HISTORICAL AND ONGOING SIGNIFICANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS TO EASTERN EUROPE POLITICS AND SOCIETY AND UNDERLINE HOW ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS EXPOSE THE FLAWS AND VULNERABILITIES OF UNDEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. DRAWING ON HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND THE EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANTS, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS PROTECT, DEEPEN AND SHAPE DEMOCRACY AS PRACTISED AND EXPERIENCED.
194	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SENTENCING REMARKS IN ALL PUBLICLY REPORTED AUSTRALIAN CASES ON ASSISTED SUICIDE AND MERCY KILLING SINCE 1980. THEMES EMERGING FROM JUDICIAL REASONS FOR SENTENCING CONFIRM THAT MANY TRADITIONAL AIMS OF SENTENCING - SUCH AS SPECIFIC DETERRENCE, RETRIBUTION OR REHABILITATION - ARE INAPPOSITE IN CASES WHERE RELATIVES OR FRIENDS ACT OUTSIDE THE LAW TO END THE SUFFERING OF A LOVED ONE. PRONOUNCED LENIENCY IN SENTENCING, OBSERVED ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF CASES, DEMONSTRATES A GAP BETWEEN THE LAW ON THE BOOKS AND THE SENTENCES IMPOSED IN PRACTICE. WE IDENTIFY INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES, BOTH IN CHARGES LAID AND SENTENCES IMPOSED, WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW. WE CONCLUDE THAT CRIMINAL LAW SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDES BOTH TOO MUCH PROTECTION AND INSUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. WE RECOMMEND LAW REFORM TO ENABLE JUDGES TO BETTER DISTINGUISH BETWEEN VOLUNTARY AND NON-VOLUNTARY ASSISTED SUICIDES AND MERCY KILLINGS.
195	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EU INSTITUTIONS' RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. BY BUILDING ON A SYNTHESIS OF THE NEW INTERGOVERNMENTALISM AND THE EMERGENCY POLITICS APPROACH IT CONTENDS THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS AND LEGITIMACY OF DE NOVO BODIES LIKE THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (ESM) AND THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK (EIB) HAVE FALLEN PREY TO ITS INTERGOVERNMENTAL DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURE, WHEREAS THE ECB HAS PROVEN TO BE MORE RESILIENT. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AS THE TRADITIONAL ENGINE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION WAS ABLE TO FILL THE GAP WITH ITS LARGE-SCALE RECOVERY INSTRUMENT TERMED 'NEXT GENERATION EU' AND VIA THE CREATION OF A TEMPORARY LOAN-BASED INSTRUMENT TO SUPPORT NATIONAL SHORT-TERM WORK SCHEMES (SURE). THE HISTORIC JULY 2020 EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRODUCED POLICY OUTPUTS SUCH AS THE 'EMERGENCY BRAKE' AND THE DILUTED 'RULE OF LAW MECHANISM' THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN THE RIFT BETWEEN POLARIZED MEMBER STATES.
196	AS THE MOST FREQUENT AND MOST SUCCESSFUL USER OF THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM OF THE WTO, THE US HAS WELCOMED JUDICIAL CLARIFICATIONS BY WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES WHENEVER THEY CONFIRMED LEGAL CLAIMS OF THE US. YET, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INCREASINGLY REJECTS JUDICIAL FINDINGS AGAINST THE US TRADE RESTRICTIONS AS VIOLATING THE WTO PROHIBITIONS OF "ADD(ING) TO OR DIMINISH(ING) THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS PROVIDED IN THE COVERED AGREEMENTS." THIS CONTRIBUTION CRITICIZES THE ILLEGAL US 'BLOCKING' OF THE WTO APPELLATE BODY AND THE UNDERLYING, HEGEMONIC NATIONALISM AND PROTECTIONIST INTEREST GROUP POLITICS. IT SUGGESTS THAT REASONABLE AND RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS BENEFITTING FROM THE WTO TRADING, LEGAL AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS MUST RESIST ILLEGAL POWER POLITICS, FOR INSTANCE, BY SUPPORTING A WTO ADJUDICATION@ME.TOO "ENLIGHTENMENT CAMPAIGN" PRESSURING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REMEDIES IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AS PRESCRIBED BY PARLIAMENTS WHEN THEY APPROVED THE WTO AGREEMENT.
197	IN THE AFTERMATH OF ANTI-MUSLIM VIOLENCE IN GUJARAT, INDIA, IN 2002, NGOS AND ACTIVISTS ENCOURAGED SURVIVORS TO TESTIFY AGAINST HINDU PERPETRATORS IN COURT. THROUGH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL IN THE LOWER COURTS OF AHMEDABAD, I SHOW HOW STATE OFFICIALS AND PERPETRATORS USED LEGAL PROCEDURES TO TRANSFORM MUSLIM SURVIVORS INTO UNRELIABLE WITNESSES IN THE COURTROOM. THESE FORMAL AND INFORMAL TECHNIQUES TO DESTABILIZE MUSLIM WITNESSES ARE BEST UNDERSTOOD NOT AS BYPRODUCTS OF THE LAW'S FAILURE TO ADDRESS MASS VIOLENCE, BUT AS A LEGAL PERFORMANCE OF HINDU SUPREMACY. PROCEDURAL AND POSITIVISTIC APPROACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW FAILED TO ADDRESS THE LAW AS A PERFORMANCE EMBEDDED IN THE CONTEXT OF HINDU NATIONALISM IN GUJARAT. NOT ONLY DO SUCH TRIALS DISCREDIT WITNESSES OF MASS VIOLENCE, BUT THEY ALSO GIVE A LEGAL FORM TO THE SUBORDINATE STATUS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES WITHIN A MAJORITARIAN POLITICAL REGIME.
198	THE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (FTAS) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AIM AT PROTECTING TRANSNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS (PGS) - SUCH AS A RULES-BASED, TRANSATLANTIC MARKET - THAT COULD BE PROGRESSIVELY EXTENDED TO OTHER EUROPEAN AND NORTH-AMERICAN FTA MEMBERS AND SERVE AS A MODEL FOR REFORMING WORLDWIDE TRADE RULES AND GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND GOVERNANCE CAN PROTECT PGS MORE EFFECTIVELY IF CITIZENS ARE EMPOWERED AS 'DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPALS' TO HOLD MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS LEGALLY, DEMOCRATICALLY AND JUDICIALLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR GOVERNANCE FAILURES. THE LISBON TREATY ESTABLISHED A 'COSMOPOLITAN FOREIGN POLICY CONSTITUTION' REQUIRING 'PROTECTION OF ITS CITIZENS', 'STRICT OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW' AND RIGHTS-BASED MARKET REGULATIONS ALSO IN THE EU'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS. THIS CONTRIBUTION CRITICIZES EU POLICIES OF DISEMPOWERING CITIZENS IN FTAS AND UNDERMINING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. WITHOUT RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW, THE EU CANNOT OVERCOME ITS CRISES OF LEGITIMACY AND THE DISTRUST OF CITIZENS VIS-A-VIS INTERGOVERNMENTAL EU REGULATIONS.
199	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CASE STUDY FROM LIBERIA THAT FOCUSES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE REFORM AND WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY. IT EXPLORES THE LIBERIA NATIONAL POLICE'S (LNP) INNOVATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN 2003 AND 2013 TO RECRUIT MORE FEMALE OFFICERS AND TO TRAIN A SPECIALIZED UNIT TO ADDRESS SEXUAL- AND GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (SGBV). THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON TWO KEY GOALS OF THE LNP: REPRESENTATION, THROUGH THE EDUCATION SUPPORT PROGRAMME, AND RESPONSIVENESS, THROUGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S PROTECTION SECTION. ASSESSED BY THESE TWO METRICS, THE LIBERIAN POLICE REFORM CAN BE CONSIDERED A QUALIFIED SUCCESS, AS THE PERCENTAGE OF FEMALE OFFICERS ROSE FROM 2 TO 17 PER CENT, AND THE LNP IMPROVED ITS RESPONSE TO SGBV REPORTS. SUCCESS FACTORS INCLUDED THE TIMING, CONTEXT, LOCAL OWNERSHIP AND FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, THE SUSTAINABILITY AND OVERALL IMPACT OF THE REFORMS WAS SEVERELY HINDERED BY LOW TECHNICAL CAPACITY AND WEAK RULE OF LAW.
200	IN HER TRENCHANT CRITIQUE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH SETTLER-COLONIAL LAW, IN ITS SEEMINGLY PROGRESSIVE MANIFESTATION THROUGH THE MABO NATIVE TITLE LEGISLATION, IN FACT OPERATED AS A 'PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FORM OF NEOCOLONIAL PRACTICE', PENNY PETHER (1998: 130) DEMONSTRATES HOW THIS ASSERTION OF CONTEMPORARY NEOCOLONIAL PRACTICE WAS PREDICATED ON THE HIGH COURT'S REFUSAL TO ADDRESS THE CHARGED ISSUE OF ABORIGINAL SOVEREIGNTY - WITH ALL THE ATTENDANT FOUNDATIONAL RAMIFICATIONS THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ENTAILED. IN ADJUDICATING ON THIS ISSUE, AUSTRALIAN SETTLER-COLONIAL LAW WAS, IN PETHER'S (1998: 124) MEMORABLE PHRASE, ACTING AS 'A SPECIES OF EXCESS OF ITS OWN AUTHORITY'. IF, PETHER (1998: 116) ARGUES, MABO WAS MARKED BY WHAT 'THE JUDGMENT REFUSES TO DO' (THAT IS, ACKNOWLEDGE ABORIGINAL SOVEREIGNTY), THEN IT IS ALSO INSCRIBED, PARADOXICALLY, BY WHAT IT 'MAKES IMAGINABLE': THAT ABORIGINAL SOVEREIGNTY HAS NEVER BEEN EXTINGUISHED - DESPITE OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF COLONIAL RULE (OF LAW).
201	DEBATES ABOUND REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPETITION LAW AND ECONOMIC REGULATION AS ALTERNATIVE AND/OR OVERLAPPING MECHANISMS BY WHICH TO ADDRESS MARKET FAILURE. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A SERIES OF LEGAL POWERS THAT DEMONSTRATE A 'HYBRIDISED' NATURE, PITCHED BETWEEN THE CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTS OF COMPETITION LAW AND REGULATION: THE MARKET INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE UNDER THE UK'S ENTERPRISE ACT 2002, THE EU'S SECTOR INQUIRY PROCEDURE UNDER REGULATION 1/2003, ACCESS TO INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION UNDER PART IIIA OF AUSTRALIA'S COMPETITION AND CONSUMER ACT 2010, AND THE CONTROVERSIAL PROHIBITION ON 'UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION' UNDER SECTION 5 OF THE US'S FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT, WHILST EACH OF THESE POWERS AIMS TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKET SUPERVISION BY INCORPORATION OF COMPLEMENTARY ASPECTS OF EACH MECHANISM, THE CHOICE TO STEP OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF EACH GENERATES ITS OWN RISKS RELATING TO BOTH RULE OF LAW COMPLIANCE AND OVERALL EFFICIENCY.
202	THE PURPOSE OF SUPERVISION OF THE WHOLE FINANCIAL MARKET IS TO ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE MARKET, ITS STABILITY, SECURITY, AND TRANSPARENCY, AS WELL AS TO ENSURE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS. THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR CONCERNING BANKING SUPERVISION, INSURANCE AND PENSION SUPERVISION, SUPERVISION OF THE CAPITAL MARKET, AND SUPPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION LAWS OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT COMPANIES WHICH ARE PARTS OF FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATES. THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY PARTICULAR FORM OF ORGANIZATIONAL SUPERVISION OVER NATIONAL LEGISLATURES. DESPITE THIS, IN MANY MEMBER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UK, GERMANY AND POLAND, THE INTEGRATED SUPERVISORS FOR BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND CAPITAL MARKET DO OPERATE. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MARKET SUPERVISION IN THE UK, GERMANY AND POLAND WITH AN AIM TO COMPARE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.
203	ANY LEGAL SYSTEM CAN ONLY BE AS GOOD AS THE LEGAL PROFESSIONALS WHO MAKE IT WORK. CHINA'S JUDGES, PROCURATORS, LAWYERS AND NOTARIES ARE EMERGING AS QUITE SEPARATE PROFESSIONS, PRESENTLY NUMBERING AROUND 600,000. COULD THERE BE A LEGAL COMMUNITY AMONG THESE PROFESSIONALS, PERHAPS WITH OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LAW, SUCH AS THE TEACHERS IN CHINA'S 600 LAW SCHOOLS, OR EVEN THE POLICE? SUCH A COMMUNITY COULD BE A POWERFUL INFLUENCE TOWARD RULE BY LAW OR EVEN RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ARGUMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A COMMUNITY, THE FACTORS WHICH MIGHT PROMOTE OR HINDER THE EMERGENCE OF A LEGAL COMMUNITY AND THE PROSPECTS FOR ITS EMERGENCE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE HINDERING FACTORS ARE STRONGER, AND THAT SUCH A COMMUNITY IS UNLIKELY TO EMERGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND MAY NEVER EMERGE.
204	STARTING 1989, THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL EUROPE PROMOTED AND DEVELOPED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U). THE NEW WAVE OF EU ENLARGEMENT WAS MEANT TO TRANSFER INTO THE SOUTH-EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE THE GOALS OF PEACE, STABILITY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE COURSE OF INTEGRATION OF SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE IN THE EU AND THE ESSENTIAL CHANGES THAT ARE REQUIRED, THE TRANSITION TO THE FREE MARKET ECONOMY, THE CREATION OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT WILL BE BASED ON RULE OF LAW AND THE RESPECT THE HUMAN AND MINORITIES RIGHTS, THE POLITICAL PLURALITY AND THE MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM WITH DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. THE ARTICLE STATES THAT THE ENLARGEMENT TO THE SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE EU, AN ENLARGEMENT THAT REPRESENTS A HOPE FOR THE COMMON EUROPEAN REGION OF PEACE, COOPERATION, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT.
205	ADVOCATES OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ARGUE THAT INFORMAL, COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONS ARE BETTER PLACED TO PROVIDE INEXPENSIVE, EXPEDIENT AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FORMS OF JUSTICE. IN 1988, THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT EXTENDED JUDICIAL CAPACITY TO LOCAL COUNCILS (LCS) ON SIMILAR GROUNDS. DRAWING ON ATTEMPTS BY WOMEN IN SOUTHWESTERN UGANDA TO USE THE LCS TO ADJUDICATE PROPERTY DISPUTES, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES WHY POPULAR JUSTICE HAS FAILED TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMARY PROPERTY RIGHTS OF WOMEN. THE GAP BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE ARISES OUT OF MISCONCEPTIONS OF COMMUNITY. THE TENDENCY TO ASCRIBE A MORALITY AND AUTONOMY TO LOCAL SPACES OBSCURES THE ABILITY OF ELITES TO USE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PURPOSES OF SOCIAL CONTROL. IN THE LIGHT OF WOMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE THE 'RULE OF PERSONS' AND TO SEEK OUT ARBITERS WHOM THEY ASSOCIATE WITH THE 'RULE OF LAW', IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE UTILITY OF THE STATE TO ORDINARY UGANDANS SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED.
206	THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE THAT RELIANCE ON FOREIGN AID FROM WESTERN DONORS COMPELS REPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TO EMBRACE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS AND RESPECT CITIZENS' RIGHTS. HOWEVER, DONORS HAVE ANOTHER, POTENTIALLY MORE POWERFUL SOURCE OF FINANCIAL LEVERAGE: DEBT RELIEF. THIS PAPER EXPLOITS TWO FEATURES OF THE HEAVILY INDEBTED POOR COUNTRIES (HIPC) DEBT RELIEF INITIATIVE, LAUNCHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND WORLD BANK IN 1996, TO PROBE WHETHER WESTERN LEVERAGE HAS CONSTRAINED REPRESSION ACROSS AFRICA. FIRST, THE BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTIONS INITIATED DEBT RELIEF NEGOTIATIONS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS. SECOND, MANY RECIPIENTS WERE IN POWER LONG BEFORE HIPC NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN AND REMAINED AFTER THEY CONCLUDED. USING A DIFFERENCES-IN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATOR, I SHOW THAT THE DAILY RATE OF REPRESSION FELL BY BETWEEN 10% AND 30% DURING DEBT RELIEF NEGOTIATIONS. THIS EFFECT HOLDS ACROSS AUTOCRACIES AND DEMOCRACIES, AND DURING PERIODS OF SUSTAINED PROTESTS. WHEN DEBT CRISES WERE MORE SEVERE, DEBT RELIEF NEGOTIATIONS WERE EVEN MORE CONSTRAINING.
207	THE ARTICLE TAKES NOTICE OF THE NECESSITY TO SEPARATE INTERSECTING SCOPES OF THE REGULATED LEGAL ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY ADVOCATES, ATTORNEYS-AT-LAW, PATENT ATTORNEYS AND PARTIALLY BY NOTARIES AND NON-REGULATED (FREE) LEGAL ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY ANYONE ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM. BOTH OF THESE LEGAL ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED UNDER THE SAME SUBCLASS (69.10.Z) OF THE PKD (POLISH CLASSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES), ALTHOUGH ACCORDING TO THE OBLIG-ATORY REGULATIONS THE CONDITIONS FOR UNDERTAKING AND PERFORMING THEM ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. THE ARTICLE COMPRISES OF FINDINGS CONCERNING THE NATURE, SCOPE AND EFFECTS OF THE DEFECTIVENESS OF THE LEGAL ACTIVITY REGULATION IN POLISH LAW AND INDICATES DE LEGE FERENDA THE POSSIBLE METHODS OF FIXING IT. THE RESULTS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH HAVE A SIGNIFICANT MEANING NOT ONLY FOR THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO FOR THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE POLISH LEGAL SERVICES MARKET.
208	ONE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THE EXILE OF THE CHAGOS ISLANDERS AND THEIR INABILITY TO RETURN TO THEIR ANCESTRAL LAND IS THROUGH A READING OF THE CASE FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF POST-COLONIAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. CHAGOSSIANS HAVE STRONG LEGAL RIGHTS TO LAND AND REMEDIES OF COMPENSATION AND RETURN THROUGH A PURPOSIVE APPLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DEFINITION OF INDIGENOUS, MAGNA CARTA RIGHT TO ABODE AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW THAT COULD ADDRESS THEIR DISPOSSESSION. YET, THE INABILITY OF THOSE RIGHTS TO BE MEANINGFULLY APPLIED HAS BEEN CONSTRAINED BECAUSE OF THE POST-COLONIAL WAY THEY ARE LEGALLY INTERPRETED, CREATING A LEGAL VACUUM IN WHICH BASIC FAIRNESS AND SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY COMPROMISED. DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CONTINUED LEGAL DENIAL OF RETURN IN THE CONTEXT OF DECOLONISATION, ONGOING COLONIALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW MAKES SENSE OF THE LEGAL RECORD AND EXPLAINS THE EXPULSION OF THE ISLANDERS DESPITE THE MORAL MERITS OF RETURN.
209	THERE IS A COMMON ASSUMPTION THAT WHEN SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT (SFM) IS NOT PRACTISED THE REASONS ARE USUALLY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR LACK OF TRAINING IN APPLYING THOSE TECHNIQUES. WE TRACE THE INTERMITTENT DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES FOR SFM IN THE TROPICAL RAINFOREST OF GUYANA (SOUTH AMERICA), BEGINNING WITH THE CLASSICAL OBSERVATIONAL ECOLOGY AT MORABALLI CREEK IN 1929. WE REFERENCE THE DELIBERATE LACK OF APPLICATION OF SFM IN SPITE OF ACCESS TO SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND REPEATED TRAINING. IN THIS COUNTRY, A PRECARIOUS POLITICAL DEMOCRACY IS DESTABILISED BY THE GIGANTIC PROFITS FROM ILLEGAL LOGGING AND LOG TRADING WHICH SUPPORT CORRUPTION IN THE SECTOR AND GENERALLY ACROSS REGULATORY SYSTEMS. THE HIGHEST RATE OF GRADUATE EMIGRATION IN THE WORLD CONTRIBUTES TO THE DIFFICULTY OF CREATING THE CORE OF MORAL LEADERSHIP REQUIRED TO RISE ABOVE THE LOCAL TRADITION OF UNDER-THE-TABLE NEGOTIATION IN PLACE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
210	THE PAPER HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO PROBLEMS RELATED TO SPATIAL PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT FACED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS TO THIS PROCESS IN POLAND. THE PRIMARY AIM IS TO PRESENT THE MOST SERIOUS DILEMMAS IN RESPECT OF SPATIAL PLANNING AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL, WHICH IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN TERMS OF THE SPATIAL POLICY OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO IDENTIFY ISSUES WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, REQUIRE URGENT RESPONSE FROM THE STATE DUE TO THEIR ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SPACE. SURVEYS CARRIED OUT WITHIN THE KRAKOW METROPOLITAN AREA ALLOWED FOR DRAWING IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS. THUS IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE DEFECTIVE SPATIAL PLANNING SYSTEM, PERCEIVED THROUGH THE PRISM OF IMPERFECT PLANNING STUDIES, REQUIRES MODERNIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT WHICH SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED ONCE THE RULE OF LAW ON WHICH THE SPATIAL PLANNING SYSTEM IN POLAND IS BASED IS RECONSTRUCTED.
211	FROM THE LATE 1990S, IN RESPONSE TO GROWING UNREST AND CRIME, THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) PUT GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF THE "COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC SECURITY" (CMS) THAN IT DID ON LEGAL REFORM AS THE MAIN MEANS OF "MAINTAINING SOCIAL STABILITY" (WEIWEN). AFTER MORE THAN A DECADE, HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT THAT CMS IS HIGHLY INEFFICIENT, AND ITS IMPACT ON WEIWEN IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE MEASURES, MECHANISMS, AND LOGIC OF CMS IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN WHY IT DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED. BY ANALYZING DATA AND EXAMPLES OF CMS-SUCH AS EXPENDITURE ON POLICING AND PAYING INFORMANTS-THIS PAPER SHOWS IT IS PRECISELY THE ELEMENTS OF CMS THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT MAKE IT DOOMED TO FAILURE. INDEED, THE INCREASING DEPENDENCE UPON CMS, RATHER THAN THE LAW, REPRESENTS A STEP BACKWARD IN LEGAL AND POLITICAL REFORM.
212	INCOME INEQUALITY AND ITS ECONOMIC EFFECTS HAVE BECOME A MATTER OF GENERALIZED CONCERN. A CONSENSUS HAS RECENTLY EMERGED IN THE LITERATURE THAT INEQUALITY HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EXACT MECHANISMS DRIVING THIS EFFECT. USING PANEL DATA FROM 113 COUNTRIES OVER THE 1980-2010 PERIOD AS WELL AS DIFFERENT INDEXES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW INCOME INEQUALITY AFFECTS INVESTMENT IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS. IT DOCUMENTS THAT INEQUALITY SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASES INVESTMENT ONLY FOR POOR PROPERTY RIGHTS BUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT VANISHES AS PROPERTY RIGHTS IMPROVE. ANALYSING THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS REVEALS TWO MECHANISMS AT WORK. FIRST, WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT SECURED, INEQUALITY MAY INCREASE RENT-SEEKING ACTIVITIES BY THE WEALTHY ELITE AT THE EXPENSE OF INVESTMENT. SECOND, WHEN THE ACCESS TO THE CREDIT MARKET IS IMPERFECT, HIGHER INEQUALITY EXCLUDES THE POOR FROM THE MARKET, WHICH REDUCES INVESTMENT.
213	INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION (IBA), INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS (ICJ), AND UNITED NATIONS (UN) HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO REFORM MYANMAR'S LAWS REGARDING THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS PART OF LARGER RULE-OF-LAW INITIATIVES IN THE COUNTRY. PART OF SUCH EFFORTS ARE STRATEGIES TO CHANGE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT RULES TO MATCH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES IN THE REGULATION OF LAWYERS. THE PRESENT ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE DISCIPLINARY MECHANISMS FOR LAWYERS IN MYANMAR. THE ANALYSIS SEEKS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MYANMAR'S EXISTING DISCIPLINARY MECHANISMS FOR LAWYERS DEVIATE FROM INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS HELD BY THE IBA, ICJ, AND UN. THE ANALYSIS ARGUES THAT THE STRUCTURAL NATURE OF MYANMAR'S DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM RENDERS IT INCAPABLE OF MEETING INTERNATIONAL EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE IT SUSTAINS BRITISH COLONIAL LAWS THAT CENTRALIZED POWER OVER LAWYERS UNDERNEATH INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE. THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE DEVIATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL LEGAL TRANSPLANT EFFORTS.
214	OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, THE ACTIVE PROMOTION OF OR GOVERNMENT ACQUIESCENCE IN A SURGE OF PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION (PHE) HAS BECOME A COMMON PHENOMENON GLOBALLY. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND PITFALLS OF PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (PHEIS) USING QUESTIONNAIRES, INTERVIEWS AND DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS AS DATA GATHERING TOOLS. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERCEIVED AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAKE IN ADDRESSING THE WIDER DEMANDS OF ACCESS AND GENDER PARITY, AND LOCAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THE SECTOR IS EQUALLY LIABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF PITFALLS RELATED TO ITS POOR IMAGE, SUBSTANDARD QUALITY, ILLICIT BEHAVIOUR AND PROHIBITIVE REGULATIONS. IT ARGUES THAT IF THE CURRENT DEFICIENCIES OF THE SECTOR ARE TO BE ADDRESSED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY, MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF ENHANCING THE CAPACITY OF INSTITUTIONS, ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW AND ENGENDERING PUBLIC SUPPORT THROUGH IMPROVED DELIVERY AND IMAGE.
215	AS OF JULY 9, 2018, TURKEY ABANDONED THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM AND HAS ADOPTED A SUI GENERIS KIND OF PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THE SAID NEW GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM PROVIDES THE PRESIDENT, THE EXECUTIVE ORGAN OF THE TURKISH STATE, WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PRESIDENTIAL DECREES ON MATTERS RELATING TO EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, AND SUCH AUTHORITY THAT IS CONFERRED DIRECTLY BY THE CONSTITUTION "IS NEITHER DEPENDENT ON A PRIOR PARLIAMENTARY MANDATE NOR SUBJECT TO ANY SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL"(2). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY(3), AN IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE RELATING TO "THE RULE OF LAW" STATES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE POWER IS "ORIGINAL/PRIMARY", AND THAT, AS A RULE, THE EXECUTIVE ORGAN POSSESSES A SECUNDUM LEGEM AUTHORITY. AS SUCH, THE PROSPECTIVE EFFECTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL DECREES ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY WILL BE REVIEWED IN THIS STUDY BASED ON VARIOUS DISCUSSIONS MADE BY TURKISH PUBLIC LAW ACADEMICS.
216	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE MECHANISMS VIA WHICH EVALUATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS AFFECT TRUST IN JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. COURTS IN ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AMASS A 'RESERVOIR OF GOODWILL' AMONG THE PUBLIC, WHICH INSULATES THEIR PRESTIGE FROM THE POLARISING IMPACT OF CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS. SINCE THE JUDICIALISATION OF POLITICS IN YOUNG DEMOCRACIES IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, JUDICIARIES IN THESE COUNTRIES LACK THIS RESERVOIR. HIGH PROFILE JUDICIAL EVENTS SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS ARE THEREFORE LIKELY TO AFFECT THEIR STANDING AMONG THE PUBLIC. I ARGUE THAT THERE ARE TWO MECHANISMS DRIVING THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHICH ARE ACTIVATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE PROCEEDINGS: CITIZENS' VIEWS ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF DEFENDANT CULPABILITY. I TEST THE HYPOTHESES USING SURVEYS CONDUCTED DURING THE COURSE OF FUJIMORI'S TRIAL. THE RESULTS SHED LIGHT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-AUTHORITARIAN SETTINGS.
217	THERE IS AN EMERGENT INTEREST BY CRIMINOLOGISTS IN THEORISING PROBLEMS THAT ARISE WHEN STATES BREACH CONVENTIONAL LEGAL NORMS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE CRIMINALISATION OF 'WHISTLEBLOWING' BY MANNING, ASSANGE AND SNOWDEN THAT REVEALED ILLEGAL ACTIONS BY THE STATE AND MAJOR BREACHES OF US AND WESTERN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS. THE ARTICLE ASKS WHAT SUCH DEVELOPMENTS MEAN FOR THE CONCEPTUAL AND NORMATIVE STATUS OF POLITICS AND CRIME CONSTITUTED IN THE WESTERN LIBERAL FRAME? IT IS ABOUT CRIMINOLOGISTS WHO RELY ON THAT PARADIGM AND THE NEED TO COUNTER NEO-CONSERVATIVE AGENDAS. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE US. IT DRAWS ON THE WORK OF GERMAN THEORISTS SCHMITT AND BENJAMIN WHO STAND OUTSIDE THE LIBERAL TRADITION TO HIGHLIGHT HOW MODERN STATES FREQUENTLY SUSPENDS THE RULE OF LAW AND RELIES ON THEIR OWN SOVEREIGN POWER TO DECLARE 'STATES OF EMERGENCY' TO RENDER THEIR OWN CRIMINAL CONDUCT LAWFUL.
218	REAFFIRMING THE RULE OF LAW AND REDRESSING HARM TO RIGHTS ARE KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN THE SEARCH FOR A JUST AND SUSTAINABLE PEACE. POST-CONFLICT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGE TO ALIEN PROPERTY HAVE A LONG HISTORY. THE EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF INVESTMENT TREATIES AND RELEVANT PROTECTIONS CONTAINED THEREIN SUGGEST THAT INVESTMENT ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS MAY PLAY A ROLE IN RE-ESTABLISHING RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL NORMS POST-CONFLICT. TRIBUNALS MAY ALSO, HOWEVER, DETRACT FROM THE PEACEBUILDING PROCESS IF THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE BROADER CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY ARE OPERATING. THERE IS AN INHERENT TENSION IN URGING SPECIALIST, AD HOC BODIES WITH LIMITED JURISDICTION TO CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES, INTERESTS AND NORMS. YET, AS THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES, THE NATURE OF INVESTMENT TREATIES AND APPLICABLE PROTECTIONS, DEFENCES, JUSTIFICATIONS, AND PROCEDURAL TOOLS, AFFORD TRIBUNALS AVENUES TO TAKE A BROADER VIEW OF RELEVANT LEGAL NORMS AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS IMPLICATED IN THE CLAIM.
219	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA'S FORENSICS AND THEORY OF CRIMINALISTICS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY. A SOCIAL REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA OCCURRED IN THE EARLY 1990'S, AND THE NEW CONSTITUTION DECLARED RUSSIA TO BE A STATE OF LAW AND JUSTICE, AND PROCLAIMED THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRIORITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM. ACCORDING TO THESE PROCLAIMED PRIORITIES, MASSIVE JUDICIAL AND LEGAL REFORMS WERE INSTITUTED, AND ARE STILL LASTING. RUSSIA BEGAN PROGRESSING FROM THE INVESTIGATING TYPE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE TO A MORE CONTROVERSIAL ONE. THE CHANGES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE HOME AND FOREIGN POLICY HAVE HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE UPON THE CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN CRIMINALISTICS AS WELL. THE ADAPTATION TO NEW CONDITIONS OF LEGAL REALITY BECAME A MAIN TASK OF RUSSIAN CRIMINALISTICS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MODIFICATION OF RUSSIAN CRIMINALISTICS (BOTH FORENSIC AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES).
220	THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT PRESENTS NATION-STATES WITH A FAIRLY NOVEL OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, OR TO SIGNAL THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE RISKS IT POSES TO THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND FOREIGN POLICIES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE OF STATES TO ISSUE DECLARATIONS TO THE ICC TREATY-THE TREATY OF ROME-IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS STATES HAVE WITH INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW. WE DEVELOP TWO THEORETICAL ACCOUNTS TO EXPLAIN STATE PROCLIVITY TO ISSUE DECLARATIONS-THE NEED TO ADDRESS POWERFUL, DOMESTIC POLITICAL INTERESTS INVOLVED IN THE TWO-LEVEL BARGAINING THAT TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIES THE RATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, AND STATE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THROUGH THE USE OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF DECLARATIONS AND OUR FACTORS OF INTEREST, WE FIND SUPPORT FOR BOTH THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES.
221	ALTHOUGH THE FIRST PERSIAN LANGUAGE NEWSPAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN IRAN 170 YEARS AGO, IRANIAN JOURNALISM IS A TWENTIETH CENTURY CREATION, INDEED A PRODUCT OF THE 1906 CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION. THE PRESS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT PART IN THE REVOLUTION, ESPECIALLY BY PROMOTING THE DEMAND FOR THE RULE OF LAWS ENACTED BY PARLIAMENT, RATHER THAN DECREES ISSUED BY THE KING OR THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS. ONCE A CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN DECLARED, MANY JOURNALISTS FELT RELIEVED OF ALL RESTRICTIONS AND ENGAGED IN BITTER, PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THEIR OPPONENTS, INCLUDING THE MONARCH AND HIS FAMILY. MANY PAPERS ALSO OPPOSED A PRESS LAW THAT WAS PASSED SOON AFTER THE REVOLUTION, ARGUING THAT IT WAS MEANT TO SUPPRESS THEIR NEWLY-GAINED FREEDOM. FIVE MORE PRESS LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN IRAN SINCE THEN, BUT THE DEBATE OVER PRESS FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR RESOLUTION.
222	THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) IN COMMISSION V HUNGARY HIGHER EDUCATION RULED THAT THE LEGAL CONDITIONS INTRODUCED TO ENABLE FOREIGN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO CARRY OUT THEIR ACTIVITIES IN HUNGARY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH EU LAW. THE COMMISSION REFERRED HUNGARY TO THE CJEU, CLAIMING THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 2011 ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH HUNGARY'S COMMITMENTS AS A MEMBER OF THE EU WITHIN THE FOLLOWING FRAMEWORKS: THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE IN SERVICES (GATS); THE FREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT; THE FREE MOVEMENT OF SERVICES; THE PROVISIONS OF THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS RELATING TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM; THE FREEDOM TO FOUND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS; AND THE FREEDOM TO CONDUCT A BUSINESS. THIS NOTE EXPLAINS THAT COMMISSION V HUNGARY HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF THE ONGOING EFFORTS IN HUNGARY TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND THREATEN ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN THE EU
223	THIS PAPER EXAMINES AND UNCOVERS THE KEY DRIVERS OF E-PARTICIPATION PROGRESS OR GROWTH OVER THE YEARS, GLOBALLY AND REGIONALLY. THE AUTHORS USED FIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION MODEL ON A PANEL DATA OF VARIABLES GATHERED BY REPUTABLE WORLD ORGANIZATIONS FOR AN 8-YEAR PERIOD - ONE OF THE LARGEST EXAMINED TO DATE. THEY TESTED A RESEARCH MODEL INCLUDING GDP PER CAPITA, ICT INFRASTRUCTURE, SECONDARY EDUCATION ENROLMENT, TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND OUTPUTS, AND SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT E-PARTICIPATION PROGRESS IS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GDP PER CAPITA, AND ICT INFRASTRUCTURE. ANALYSES BASED UPON SIX GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS OF THE WORLD AND COUNTRIES' INCOME-LEVEL CLASSIFICATIONS (I.E., LOW, LOW-MIDDLE, HIGH-MIDDLE, HIGH) SHOW THAT DETERMINANTS OF E-PARTICIPATION PROGRESS VARY BY GEOGRAPHICAL AND INCOME-LEVEL CONTEXTS.
224	TAKING LIBERALISM'S MEASURE AS AN INDISPENSABLE YET INHERENTLY FRAGILE DESIGN GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT BY CONSENT, INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC RIGHTS, AND POLITICAL REPRESENTATION, MY WORK AT THE INTERSECTION OF IDEAS, INSTITUTIONS, AND METHODS TO APPRAISE BEHAVIOR HAS FOCUSED ON ORIGINS AND TRANSITIONS, MEMBERSHIP BOUNDARIES AND DOMINATION, AND AN UNSTEADY BONDING WITH THE OLDER REGIME MODEL OF DEMOCRACY. SHAPED BY EARLY AND LATER LIFE EXPERIENCES AND GUIDED BY THE GOOD FORTUNE OF STIMULATING NETWORKS AND ENABLING INSTITUTIONS, MY ANALYTICAL HISTORIES OF THOUGHT AND EVENTS, PRIMARILY IN THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE, HAVE ASKED WHEN AND WHY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES BECOME NORMATIVELY APPEALING (LESS CLOSED AND MORE TOLERANT) AND MORE EFFECTIVE (LESS VULNERABLE AND MORE SECURE). AS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST TRAINED IN HISTORY, I HAVE BEEN KEEN TO ADVANCE A DISCIPLINE THAT REFUSES TO BE ENCLOSED OR TOO CRISPLY DIVIDED INTO SUBFIELDS, OR, INDEED, TO CHOOSE BETWEEN QUESTS FOR CAUSALITY AND UNDERSTANDING.
225	THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY HAS, AS ONE OF ITS CHARACTERISTIC MANIFESTATIONS, WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, THE FORCE OF RES JUDICATA THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FINAL JUDGEMENTS OR EQUIVALENT RESOLUTIONS, WHICH IMPLY THAT IT IS NOT IMPUGNABLE AND ALSO ITS POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON OTHER CASES WITH A CONNECTION TO THE MATTER ALREADY SETTLED. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE FINAL JUDICIAL DECISIONS OF NATIONAL JUDGES, FOR VARIOUS REASONS (ERROR, OMISSION, A MANIFESTLY CONTRARY INTERPRETATION, ETC.) VIOLATE THE EUROPEAN UNION LAW AND, THEREFORE, AFFECT BOTH ITS PRIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN THE RELATIONS WITH NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT THE DILEMMA OF BALANCING THE PRINCIPLE OF RES JUDICATA WITH THE PRIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EU LAW IN SEVERAL CASES. THIS WORK AIMS TO DEVELOP AN APPROXIMATION AND REVIEW OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CASES RELATED TO THIS BALANCE UNTIL TODAY.
226	EUROPEAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES HAS GONE THROUGH FOUR PHASES. THE INTERWAR PERIOD WAS A TIME OF DEMOCRATIC WEAKNESS AND ETHNIC CONFLICT THAT CULMINATED IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR. WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A PERIOD OF DIVISION AND YET ALSO INTEGRATION, PARTICULARLY IN WESTERN EUROPE. WESTERN EUROPEANS SOUGHT TO TRANSCEND THE NATION-STATE THROUGH THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE END OF THE COLD WAR SUGGESTED THE VICTORY OF THIS CIVILIZING MISSION, BUT THAT SUGGESTION WAS NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCING-NOT BECAUSE OF THE RE-EMERGENCE OF ETHNIC CONFLICT, BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING TENSION BETWEEN POPULAR AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS BROUGHT THAT TENSION TO THE SURFACE AND PLACED A GREAT STRAIN ON THE WIDER INTEGRATION PROJECT. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW TO INTERPRET THIS ARC IN THE NARRATIVE OF EUROPEAN HISTORY. WAS UNIFICATION ALWAYS A DREAM WHILE DIVISION REMAINS A REALITY?
227	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FIELD OF LEGAL AUTOMATION, ITS ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS, THE WAYS IN WHICH LEGAL CONSTRAINTS AND SAFEGUARDS CAN BE EMBEDDED INTO TECHNOLOGY AND HOW THE LAW MAY GOVERN HUMAN BEHAVIOUR THROUGH CODES, IT ARCHITECTURES, AND DESIGN. BY STRESSING BOTH BENEFITS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF LEGAL AUTOMATION, THE ARTICLE DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THE LATTER IS SOMETHING "NEUTRAL RATHER, MAKING LEGAL REASONING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTOMATIC, SO THAT EVEN A MACHINE CAN PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND THIS INFORMATION, SHOULD BE CONCEIVED AS A SET OF CONSTRAINTS AND AFFORDANCES THAT TRANSFORM, OR RESHAPE, THE ENVIRONMENT OF PEOPLE'S INTERACTION AND MOREOVER, THE INTERPLAY OF HUMAN AND ARTIFICIAL AGENTS, THEREBY AFFECTING BASIC PILLARS OF THE (RULE OF) LAW. THE OVERALL AIM IS TO FLESH OUT GOALS AND VALUES THAT ARE AT STAKE WITH CHOICES OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEPENDENCE, DELEGATION AND TRUST, SO AS TO DETERMINE THE GOOD MIX BETWEEN LEGAL AUTOMATION AND PUBLIC DELIBERATION.
228	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO HISTORICALLY EXPLORE THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE 1982 CONSTITUTION, BOTH OF WHICH ARE MULTIPLE AND CAN, THEREFORE, BE EXAMINED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. THIS INCLUDES, FIRST OF ALL, THE HISTORICAL CHANGES OF THE UNITED FRONT AND THE POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS AND THE ISOLATION FUNCTION OF THEIR NON-POLITICIZATION. SECOND, IT INCLUDES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN AND THE UNIFICATION OF THE LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLE AND THE REPRESENTATION PRINCIPLE. LASTLY, IT INCLUDES THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW DESIGN OF CONSTITUTIONALISM WITH RULE OF LAW, PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS AT THE CORE, WHICH TO SOME EXTENT ALTERED THE SOCIETAL AND IDEOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE. BECAUSE OF THESE COMPONENTS, THE 1982 CONSTITUTION WAS ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE COMPLEX SOCIETAL CHANGES IN THE LAST 30 YEARS, THE SECRET OF WHICH LIES IN THE MULTIPLE COMPLEX STRUCTURE CREATED BY THIS HISTORY.
229	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ROLE THAT LOCAL CURRENCY BOND MARKETS (LCBMS) CAN PLAY IN THE LONG-TERM FINANCING OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) ECONOMIES, AND PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS WHICH MAY HINDER OR PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH MARKETS IN SSA. USING A NEW DATASET FOR 27 SSA COUNTRIES, OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT EARLIER RESEARCH ON SSA AND OTHER REGIONS, SHOWING THAT LCBM DEVELOPMENT IS RELATED TO COUNTRY SIZE, LARGER BANKING SYSTEMS, GREATER TRADE OPENNESS, AND BETTER REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND RULE OF LAW. FOREIGN INVESTOR PARTICIPATION BROADENS THE INVESTOR BASE AND CAN GIVE A BOOST TO LCBM DEVELOPMENT, YET IT MAY ALSO INCREASE VOLATILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS. HENCE, WITH A VIEW TO THE EXPERIENCE OF EMERGING ECONOMIES IN OTHER REGIONS, CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION SHOULD BE PURSUED ONLY VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND IN STEP WITH SOLID FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
230	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PHENOMENON OF VIOLENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE STATISTICS OF THE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE ARE PRESENTED AND THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS VIOLENCE ARE EXAMINED. IN THIS RESPECT THE INFLUENCE OF THE HISTORIC SOCIAL STRATIFICATION, THE INCEPTION OF APARTHEID, THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEM OF THE PAST AND POVERTY ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE CENTRAL THEORETICAL ARGUMENT OF THIS STUDY IS THAT CHURCHES AND CHRISTIANS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR. THIS ROLE CAN BE FULFILLED BY NURTURING A CULTURE OF RESPECT FOR THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN DIGNITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW AND NATION BUILDING. FURTHERMORE, CHURCHES AND CHRISTIANS CAN SET SIGNS OF HOPE IN THE SOCIETY BY BEING ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE ALLEVIATION OF POVERTY, THE RECOVERY OF FAMILY VALUES AND LIFE, THE NURTURING OF SOCIAL COHESION AND THE SETTING OF EXAMPLES OF NON-VIOLENT SOLUTIONS TO CONFLICTS.
231	IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT WHILE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS BOTH AN INTRINSIC AND AN INSTRUMENTAL GOOD, GOOD SCIENCE DOES NOT CONSIST IN MAXIMIZING SUCH KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT REGARD TO ANYTHING ELSE. RATHER, LIKE THE GOOD LIFE, OR THE GOOD SOCIETY, GOOD SCIENCE REQUIRES A CAREFUL WEIGHING AND BALANCING OF KNOWLEDGE AS A VALUE AND THE VALUES OF A FREE SOCIETY, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, THE INVIOLABILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE CONSTRAINTS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. SCIENCE IS, AND SHOULD BE, COMMITTED TO KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH, BUT A SCIENCE COMMITTED ONLY TO KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH IS A HOSTAGE TO FORTUNE, AND MAY FIND ITSELF, AT EVERY TURN, ALLIED WITH INHUMANITY AND INJUSTICE, ULTIMATELY UNDERMINING, THEREBY, THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF A FREE SOCIETY AND OF FREE INQUIRY ALONG WITH IT. VARIOUS HISTORICAL CASES OF MORALLY TAINTED SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ARE BROUGHT UP AND DISCUSSED ALONG THESE LINES.
232	A PROFUSION OF GOVERNANCE MEASURES HAS EMERGED OVER THE PAST DECADE. THE MAJOR ISSUE IS WHETHER GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY BY ITS ATTRIBUTES (THUS MEASURED BY PROCESS INDICATORS) OR ALSO BY ITS IMPACT (THUS MEASURED ALSO BY OUTCOME INDICATORS). THE ARTICLE CLASSIFIES THE EXISTING MEASURES IN THREE CATEGORIES-INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION, MEASURES OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND HUMAN RIGHTS, SPECIALIZED SURVEYS-AND DISCUSSES IN GREATER DEPTH THE TWO COMPREHENSIVE SURVEYS: THE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON THE GOVERNANCE ATTRIBUTES OF ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY AND RULE OF LAW; AND THE RECENT IBRAHIM INDEX OF AFRICAN GOVERNANCE, WHICH INCLUDES IN ITS 57 INDICATORS USEFUL OUTCOME DIMENSIONS BUT ALSO INDICATORS WEAKLY RELATED TO GOVERNANCE. STREAMLINING THE IBRAHIM INDEX TO WEED OUT THESE INDICATORS WILL IMPROVE ITS CLARITY AND UTILITY AND TURN IT INTO THE STANDARD MEASURE OF GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA-PERHAPS ALSO REPLICABLE FOR OTHER REGIONS.
233	GERMANY'S FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RIVALS THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN PROTECTING POLITICAL DEMOCRACY. ITS JURISPRUDENCE OF DEMOCRACY HAS SHAPED THE COURSE AND CHARACTER OF GERMAN POLITICS WHILE UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION ALLY PRESCRIBED "FREE DEMOCRATIC BASIC ORDER." IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS INVALIDATED REGULATIONS LIMITING THE RIGHTS OF MINOR PARTIES AND CONSTITUTIONALIZING MEASURES DESIGNED TO STABILIZE GERMANY'S SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT. THESE PURPOSES HAVE BEEN SERVED BY CONSTITUTIONAL DECISIONS ON VOTING RIGHTS, PUBLIC FUNDING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS, DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT, AND PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE LIMITING 5 PERCENT CLAUSE. THESE DECISIONS, ALONG WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE HESSIAN ELECTION REVIEW CASE - A REMINDER OF BUSH V. GORE-ARE CALCULATED TO MAKE POLITICAL REPRESENTATION BOTH RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE AND TO ANCHOR THE POLITICAL SYSTEM FIRMLY IN THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES AT THE HEART OF THE BASIC LAW.
234	IN THIS SHORT ESSAY THE AUTHOR SETS OUT TO DEMONSTRATE THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IN EXAMINING THE ROLE OF LEGAL PROFESSIONS AND SHED LIGHT ON THE SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED FIELD OF LEGAL SOCIOLOGY. IN THIS REGARD THERE ARE VALUABLE HISTORICAL ANALOGIES TO DRAW ON, BUT THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF CENTRAL EUROPE ALSO CONSTITUTE A RICH FIELD OF RESEARCH FOR EXPLORING THIS ROLE. GIVEN THAT CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS REGION STILL SUFFER FROM A POOR LEVEL OF LEGITIMACY AND THE EFFECTS OF A PRE-DEMOCRATIC CULTURAL BACKGROUND, THE IMPACT THAT PROFESSIONAL LEGAL ACTORS, AS ACTIVE AGENTS, HAVE ON THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY CAN BE OF EXCEPTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. IN NEWLY ESTABLISHED LEGAL TRADITIONS, LAWMAKERS BECOME THE ARCHITECTS OF THE EMERGING DEMOCRACY. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, THIS HISTORICAL ROLE IS ENCUMBERED BY AN ETATIST, PRE-DEMOCRATIC VALUE SYSTEM, WHICH IS THE LEGACY OF FORTY YEARS OF STATE SOCIALISM.
235	EIGHT TYPES OF CIVIC SPACES ARE IDENTIFIED AS A WAY OF ASSESSING TRENDS IN THE VITALITY OF CIVIL SOCIETY. IN PACIFIC ASIA, WITH ITS TRADITIONS OF STRONG, 'DEVELOPMENTAL' STATES, THE EMERGENCE OF CIVIC SPACES HAS LARGELY TAKEN PLACE THROUGH RESISTANCE AND INSURGENCE. HOWEVER, ONGOING POLITICAL REFORMS LEAD TO NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ROUTINE PROVISION OF CIVIC SPACES THAT ARE OPEN TO ALL AND ARE PROTECTED AGAINST STATE ABUSE BY THE RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE IMPACTS OF GLOBALISATION ON CIVIC SPACES ARE EMERGING, AS CITIES COMPETE FOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AND AS URBAN SPACES BECOME FRAGMENTED BY GLOBAL LINKAGES AND PRIVATISATION FOR COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. AGENDAS FOR CIVIC SPACE POLICIES THUS NEED TO PAY ATTENTION NOT ONLY TO PROGRESSIVE REFORMS IN STATE-CIVIL SOCIETY RELATIONS, BUT ALSO TO WAYS IN WHICH RELATIONS BETWEEN LOCALITIES AND GLOBALISATION ARE TRANSFORMING THE CONTENTS AND USES OF URBAN SPACES.
236	CONTEMPORARY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF TRANSITION IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES PROVES THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, AS WAS CLAIMED BY ADVOCATES OF THIS FIELD OF TRANSITION. THE ARTICLE ASSESSES INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE FIRST PHASES OF TRANSITION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPETING STRATEGIES: RAPID CHANGES VERSUS GRADUALISM. AFTER POINTING TO SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS DEBATE, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY AND PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A MARKET FOR INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPEAN TRANSITION COUNTRIES. THE MAIN CRITERION WHICH IS USED IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF A MARKET ECONOMY. IT CONCLUDES THAT UNDEVELOPED ENDOGENOUS FACTORS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE STILL DO NOT ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MARKETS FOR INSTITUTIONS. RELUCTANCE OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACT ACCORDING TO A LONG-RUN PERSPECTIVE IS AT PRESENT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT COMPENSATED BY THE PRESENCE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE.
237	FEAR OF CRIME IS A CONCERN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE RULE OF LAW IS IMPERFECTLY ENFORCED. I USE A CLUSTER -RANDOMIZED FIELD EXPERIMENT IN KENYA TO SHOW THAT REDUCING FEAR OF THEFT ALLOWS SMALL-SCALE FARMERS TO ADJUST THEIR PLANTING AND TIME USE DECISIONS, AS WELL AS INCREASING CROP YIELDS. I RANDOMLY ALLOCATED SUBSIDIZED WATCHMEN TO FARMERS IN KENYA, REDUCING THEIR PERCEIVED RISK OF THEFT. FARMERS OFFERED WATCHMEN WERE 14 P.P. MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CROPS THEY GREW FOR THE FIRST TIME OR GREW ON MORE LAND AS A RESULT OF IMPROVED SECURITY, SOLD MORE CROPS OFF-FARM, AND THEIR FARM OUTPUT PER ACRE WAS LARGER BY 15% OF THE CONTROL MEAN. THE INTERVENTION HAD POSITIVE SECURITY SPILLOVERS, AND LED TO FEWER ANGRY DISPUTES AMONG NEIGHBOURS. DESPITE THESE BENEFITS, THIS INTERVENTION IS NOT PROFITABLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL FARMER, SUGGESTING A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR COLLECTIVE SECURITY INTERVENTIONS.
238	THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO MEET THREE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BASED ON A DOCUMENTARY INVESTIGATION: 1. COMPARE THE LEVELS OF CO-RRUPTION REGISTERED IN CHILE, COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA AND MEXICO, 2. STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OTHER FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER OR HIGHER PRESENCE OF CORRUPTION IN THESE COUNTRIES. 3. IDENTIFY THE MOST RELEVANT CAUSES OF CORRUPTION IN THESE NATIONS AND THE PROGRAMS DEVELOPED TO DEAL WITH THEM. BA -SED ON THE CASES OF CHILE AND COSTA RICA, THE RULE OF LAW INDEX, THE EXECUTIVE OVERSIGHT, THE LIBERAL DEMOCRACY INDEX, THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND GDP PER CAPITA ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED. IN ADDITION, IT IS SHOWN THAT, IF THESE INDICATORS PRESENT POOR RESULTS, AS IS THE CASE IN COLOMBIA, GUATEMALA AND MEXICO, CORRUPTION INCREASES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT CAN BE SEEN THAT IF SUCH INDICATORS ARE FAVORABLE, AS IS THE CASE IN CHILE AND COSTA RICA, CORRUPTION DECREASES.
239	MANY DEVELOPING DEMOCRACIES SUFFER FROM PERSISTENT CORRUPTION AND RULE-OF-LAW VIOLATIONS. GROWING EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON ESTABLISHING ANTICORRUPTION INSTITUTIONS TO COMBAT THIS CULTURE OF IMPUNITY, BUT SUCCESS HAS BEEN MODEST. WE TACKLE THIS PUZZLE BY FOCUSING ON THE CALCULUS OF THE THREATENED CORRUPT ELITES IN UNDERMINING SERIOUS ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS. WE EXAMINE ELECTORAL MANIPULATION, AS CREDIBLE ANTICORRUPTION REFORMS MAY INCREASE PRESSURE ON CORRUPT ELITES TO FRAUDULENTLY MAINTAIN POWER IN ORDER TO CONTROL ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS. AT THE SAME TIME, ANTICORRUPTION REFORMS CAN DETER ELECTORAL MANIPULATION IF THEY SUFFICIENTLY RAISE THE COSTS OF LAWBREAKING. FOCUSING ON THE REPRESENTATIVE CASE OF ROMANIA AND USING A VARIETY OF DATA SOURCES, DIAGNOSTICS AND RESEARCH DESIGNS, WE SHOW HOW CREDIBLE ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS SYSTEMATICALLY INDUCE ELECTORAL MANIPULATION BY THE BACKLASH COALITION OF CORRUPT POLITICIANS. HOWEVER, THIS MANIPULATION IS CONSTRAINED BY ELECTORAL COMPETITION, WHICH MAY BE THE KEY TO LONGER-TERM POLITICAL CONSOLIDATION OF THESE "IMPERFECT" DEMOCRACIES.
240	THE INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) SYSTEM IS SUCH A MEANS TO AN END OF FURTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WIDER SOCIAL POLITICAL GOALS. WITH MAJOR PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF EXPROPRIATION AGAINST COMPENSATION, FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT, NATIONAL TREATMENT, MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT, FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY AND UMBRELLA CLAUSE, IT HELPS ESTABLISH A PREDICTABLE, TRANSPARENT, AND ENFORCEABLE LEGAL REGIME TO PROTECT FOREIGN INVESTORS' LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND LAWFUL INVESTMENT. AS CHINA INTENDS TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENTS BY OFFERING A STABLE BUSINESS OPERATION ENVIRONMENT, ITS SIGNING A LARGE NUMBER OF BITS AND FTAS MAY HELP REDUCE POLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC RISKS, WHICH GIVE STATES, BUSINESSES, AND INDIVIDUALS THE CONFIDENCE TO WORK IN A COORDINATED MANNER. THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOAL, RULE OF LAW STRATEGY, TENSE US-CHINA RELATIONS, IDEOLOGY OF MULTILATERALISM AND COMMUNITY OF COMMON DESTINY, ALL ADD UP TO CHINA'S INCLINATION TO INCREMENTAL BUT EFFECTIVE ISDS REFORM.
241	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE POSITION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU WITH REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT EMERGED DURING AND IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE EMU CRISIS. THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS INCREASED LEGAL INTEGRATION AND THEREFORE LED TO MORE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONTEXT OPENED THE POSSIBILITY FOR PLAINTIFFS TO CALL UPON THE CJEU. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE COURT RULINGS ON THIS MATTER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008: DOES THE COURT DEFEND SUPRANATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OR DOES IT TAKE NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CONCERNS INTO ACCOUNT? TO WHAT EXTENT DO THE COURT?S RULINGS REFLECT PARLIAMENTARY AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY? BASED ON A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK COMBINING A LEGAL AND A POLITICAL SCIENCE APPROACH, THE AIM IS TO ANALYSE WHICH TYPE OF SOVEREIGNTY THE COURT DEFENDS AND WHEN.
242	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD INSTITUTIONS IN HARNESSING THE GROWTH EFFECTS OF THE BULGING ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE POPULATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). THE PAPER UTILIZES A PANEL DATASET COMPRISING 39 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2002-13. BASED ON THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATOR, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT AN INCREASE IN THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE WORKING-AGE POPULATION HAS NO DIRECT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROWTH, EXCEPT THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF STRONG AND HIGH-QUALITY INSTITUTIONS. THE PAPER ALSO FINDS THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE THE SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONS THAT MATTER THE MOST IN REAPING THE DIVIDEND. THESE RESULTS DO NOT ONLY HIGHLIGHT THE PRIMACY OF STRONG INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO SHED LIGHT ON THE KEY INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS THAT NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED TO RAKE IN THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASING WORKING AGE POPULATION ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SSA.
243	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A "PARTICULARISTIC" CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY IMPORTANT TO TAIWANESE DEMOCRACY. THIS FORM OF LEGITIMACY, I SUGGEST, HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL FOR TAIWAN'S SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. AS EVIDENCE, I COMBINE ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD POLICE WORK WITH HISTORICAL CONSIDERATION OF A TYPE OF POLITICAL FIGURE EMERGENT IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC REFORM, WHICH I CALL THE "OUTLAW LEGISLATOR." I FOCUS MY ANALYSIS ON THE INSTITUTIONAL AND IDEOLOGICAL PROCESSES ARTICULATING LOCAL POLICING INTO THE WIDER POLITICAL FIELD. THE CENTER OF THESE PROCESSES IS A MODE OF POPULAR REPRESENTATION THAT POSITIONS THE OUTLAW LEGISLATOR AS A CRUCIAL HINGE ARTICULATING THE PARTICULARISTIC LOCAL ORDER WITH CENTRAL STATE POWERS. BY ANALYZING THE CULTURAL CONTENT OF THE DRAMATURGICAL WORK USED TO RECONCILE LOW POLICING WITH HIGHER-LEVEL STATE OPERATIONS, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW A PARTICULARISTIC IDIOM OF LEGITIMACY HELPS HOLD TAIWANESE DEMOCRACY TOGETHER.
244	ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL 1 TO THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR) GUARANTEES TO EVERY NATURAL OR LEGAL PERSON THE RIGHT TO PEACEFUL ENJOYMENT OF HIS POSSESSIONS. TAXATION AND ENFORCEMENT MEASURES RELATING THERETO ARE CONSIDERED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY AS SET OUT IN THE PRECEDING PROVISION. THE COURT HAS, ACCORDINGLY, DEVELOPED A CASE LAW REVIEWING THE COMPATIBILITY OF SUCH MEASURES WITH, AMONG OTHERS, THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY. ALTHOUGH THE COURT GRANTS A WIDE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION TO STATES AS TO TAXATION RATE, PROCEDURAL ENFORCEMENT RULES MIGHT COME UNDER DOSE SCRUTINY. OTHER SAFEGUARDS LAID DOWN IN THE CONVENTION, SUCH AS THE PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION, MIGHT FOSTER THE RULE OF LAW IN ISSUES OF TAXATION. THE STUDY PURPORTS TO UNDERLINE THE OFTEN UNDERESTIMATED POTENTIALITIES OF THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION TO TAXPAYERS.
245	ACCORDING TO MOST SCHOLARS, MONTESQUIEU ARGUES THAT FEAR THREATENS A LOSS OF SELF DISCONNECTED FROM THE EXERCISE OF REASON, FEAR IS AN EMOTION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM ACTING WITH ARTY KIND OF MORAL OR RATIONAL AGENCY. FEAR IS ALSO PREMISED ON THE LIQUIDATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY; INTERMEDIATE INSTITUTIONS AND PLURAL SOCIAL STRUCTURES ARE DESTROYED SO THAT DESPOTS CAN ACT WITH UNMITIGATED POWER AND VIOLENCE. I ARGUE THAT THIS VIEW DOES NOT CAPTURE MONTESQUIEU'S THEORY. IN MY ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT FEAR IS INTIMATELY CONNECTED TO OUR CAPACITY FOR REASON AND TO OUR SENSE OF SELF IT IS BUILT ON A NETWORK OF ELITES, THE RULE OF LAW, MORAL EDUCATION, AND THE TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. I CONCLUDE THAT TWENTIETH-CENTURY SOCIAL SCIENCE REMAINS TOO INDEBTED TO CONVENTIONAL INTERPRETATIONS OF MONTESQUIEU'S VIEWS, AND CONTEMPORARY THEORISTS WOULD BE BETTER SEWED BY THE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS PROPOSED HERE.
246	LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF TWO PROMINENT PUBLIC SECTOR REFORMSANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS AND HIGH-POWERED INCENTIVE SYSTEMSON THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF POLICY GOALS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND IN THE PRESENCE OF AN EXTRINSIC INCENTIVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CORRUPTION TO ACHIEVE PERFORMANCE TARGETS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES HOW PERFORMANCE REWARDS AND ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS JOINTLY AFFECT ADMINISTRATIVE OUTPUTS AND POLICY OUTCOMES. WE EXAMINE CHINA'S AIR POLLUTION CONTROL POLICY WITH PROVINCE-LEVEL PANEL DATA. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT PERFORMANCE REWARDS PROMPT ADMINISTRATIVE OUTPUTS THAT ARE LINKED TO THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE. ANTICORRUPTION ACTIVITIES HAVE SMALL SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THOSE OUTPUTS ONLY PRIOR TO THE INCEPTION OF HIGH-POWERED REWARDS, BUT HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON POLICY OUTCOMES, REGARDLESS OF THE MEASURE. THE INTRODUCTION OF PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES CONTRIBUTES TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF POLICY OUTCOMES ONLY WHEN THEIR MEASUREMENT IS SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT MANIPULATION.
247	AFTER PASSAGE OF THE 1988 CONSTITUTION OF BRAZIL, SUCCESSIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS WORKED TO BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN THE NATION'S FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS DEFENCE STRATEGY, THUS FOSTERING A DIALOGUE AMONG ADMINISTRATIONS AND CONSTITUENCIES UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT WAS UNDER THE LULA DA SILVA AND DILMA ROUSSEFF ADMINISTRATIONS THAT BRAZIL LAID OUT A GRAND STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE CONTROVERSIAL IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS OF 2016. THE ARGUMENT UNFOLDS FROM A CONSIDERATION OF BRAZIL'S DEVELOPMENT MODEL AND DOMESTIC POLITICS AS KEY STRUCTURAL VARIABLES IN ANALYSING THE CHALLENGES FACED IN THE CONCEPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS GRAND STRATEGY. THE ARTICLE IS ORGANISED INTO TWO SECTIONS: (1) THE SKETCH OF A GRAND STRATEGY: WHEN BRAZIL'S FOREIGN AND DEFENCE POLICIES CONVERGED; (2) AN AMBITION FRUSTRATED? OR, THE IMPACT OF BRAZIL'S DEVELOPMENT MODEL AND DOMESTIC POLITICS ON THE CONCEPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS GRAND STRATEGY.
248	THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ORGANIC LAW 8/2013 OF DECEMBER 9, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, ALLOWS EDUCATION AUTHORITIES TO SET THE SCHEDULE OF THE SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, INCLUDING RELIGION CLASSES. THIS HAS MEANT, IN SOME AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITIES, THE REDUCTION OF CLASS TIME OR THE LACK OF OFFER TO STUDY THE SUBJECT IN A LEVELS OR, IN THIS CASE, ITS OFFER WITHOUT GUARANTEEING RULE OF LAW. THIS HAS SUPPOSED THE INTERJECTION OF JUDICIARY RESOURCES WHICH THEY HAVEN'T WORKED, AS THE CURRENT SENTENCE OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE OF EXTREMADURA, WHICH DISMISSES THE APPLICATION OF BISHOPS FROM EXTREMADURA, BACUASE IT UNDERSTANDS THAT WHAT WAS SET OUT ARE ORDINARY LEGAL PROBLEMS AND THE VIOLATION PROCEDURE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SEEMS UNSUITABLE. THIS ANALYSIS DEFENDS, ON THE CONTRARY, THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN BROKEN SUCH AS 14, 16.3 AND 27.3 OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENT.
249	THE INTERSECTION OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION, PRIVACY LEGISLATION AND LIBRARY SERVICES MAY BE INTERPRETED AS THE RELATION BETWEEN TWO BODIES (LAW AND LIBRARY) AND HOW THEY INFLUENCE ONE ANOTHER DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. THIS MEANS LIBRARY SERVICES CAN BE SHAPED ENORMOUSLY BY BOTH FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PRIVACY LAWS. WE NOTICE THAT THERE ARE CASES IN VARIOUS CANADIAN COURTS INVOLVING DISAGREEMENTS CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FIELDS OF FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND PRIVACY WITH LIBRARIES. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF LEGISLATION AND STRONGER LIBRARY POLICIES MAY MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR USERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE SHARED LIBRARY RESOURCES AND SERVICES PROPERLY. FOR MANY LIBRARIES, THIS MEANS OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND PROFESSIONAL ETHICS CODES HAVE TO BE REVISED TO STRICTLY RESPECT THE USERS AND EMPLOYEES' CONFIDENTIALITY RIGHTS. THE RESEARCH METHOD USED FOR THIS PAPER INCLUDED A SEARCH OF RELEVANT CANADIAN COURT CASES AS CASE STUDIES.
250	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES FRENCH EXECUTIVES' AND LAWMAKERS' LEGITIMISATIONS OF THE INTERVENTION IN LIBYA WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF INTERVENTION. IT INVESTIGATES THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF INTERVENTION AND THE OPPOSITIONS THEY WERE CONFRONTED WITH. TO THESE ARGUMENTS BELONG A RE-EVALUATED DEMOCRATIC LEGACY OF FRANCE, AN IDENTIFICATION WITH THE LIBYAN PEOPLE, AND A DEBATE ON RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT AND THE RULE OF LAW IN WORLD POLITICS, WHICH HAVE A BROADER RELEVANCE FOR FRENCH ACTORNESS ABROAD. THE ARTICLE APPLIES THE ESSEX SCHOOL DISCOURSE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES FROM INTERPRETIVE POLICY ANALYSIS ON EXECUTIVE SPEECHES AND PARLIAMENTARY DOCUMENTS FOR STRUCTURING THE DEBATE AND FOR ESTIMATING THE STRENGTH OF IDEAS IN THEIR INTERDISCURSIVE CONFIGURATION. AN IDEAL-TYPICAL EXPLANATION OF THE LEGITIMISATION OF INTERVENTION AND OF THE CHOICE OF ONE POLICY OVER ANOTHER IS MADE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GOING TO WAR IN LIBYA EQUATED TO A QUESTION OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS.
251	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON HOW INSTITUTIONS SHAPE INNOVATIVE CAPACITY, BY FOCUSING ON HOW REGIONAL GOVERNMENT QUALITY AFFECTS INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE REGIONS OF EUROPE. BY EXPLOITING NEW DATA ON QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT, WE ASSESS HOW GOVERNMENT QUALITY AND ITS COMPONENTS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY) SHAPE PATENTING ACROSS THE REGIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS-WHICH ARE ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR THE ENDOGENEITY OF INSTITUTIONS-PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE OF A LINK BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THE CAPACITY OF REGIONS TO INNOVATE. IN PARTICULAR, INEFFECTIVE AND CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS REPRESENT A FUNDAMENTAL BARRIER FOR THE INNOVATIVE CAPACITY OF THE PERIPHERY OF THE EU, STRONGLY UNDERMINING ANY POTENTIAL EFFECT OF ANY OTHER MEASURES AIMED AT PROMOTING GREATER INNOVATION. THE RESULTS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEFINITION OF INNOVATION STRATEGIES IN EU REGIONS.
252	THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE WITNESSED THE REVIVAL OF MEDIATION AS A CHIEF METHOD OF LABOUR DISPUTE SETTLEMENT IN CHINA. WHILE THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT'S CAMPAIGN HAS REINVIGORATED THE USE OF MEDIATION IN ORDER TO CONTROL SOCIAL CONFLICTS AND MAINTAIN STABILITY, ITS EXPANSION AND EXTENSIVE DEPLOYMENT HAVE ALSO BEEN DRIVEN BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AS MEDIATION CAN BETTER SERVE THEIR POLICY PRIORITIES AND BUREAUCRATIC INTERESTS. NOT ONLY DOES THE EXTENSION OF MEDIATION PROVIDE LOCAL BUREAUCRATIC AGENCIES WITH FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETIONARY POWER TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS WITHOUT HAVING TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL MINIMUMS, IT ALSO LEGITIMIZES THE COURTS' "NON-LEGALISTIC APPROACH" TO SETTLING DISPUTE CASES. THE EXTENSIVE EMPLOYMENT OF MEDIATION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAS CHIPPED AWAY AT THE ROLE OF LEGAL PROCEDURES IN SETTLING LABOUR DISPUTES. THE REVIVAL OF MEDIATION EMBODIES A TENSION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROMOTED SINCE THE REFORM AND THE EXTRAJUDICIAL METHODS IT NEEDS FOR CONTROLLING CONFLICTS.
253	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A NORMATIVE POWER, AN ACTOR THAT NOT ONLY IS CONSTRUCTED ON A NORMATIVE BASIS, SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, MARKET ECONOMY, BUT MOST LIKELY HAS A PREDISPOSITION IN ACTING IN A NORMATIVE WAY, AND ALSO IN AN ALTRUISTIC MANNER IN THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. ONE SUCH TOOL OF PROMOTING ITS SET OF NORMS, AND CONVINCING OTHERS TO ACCEPT THEM IS THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY (ENP). THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EASTERN DIMENSION OF THE ENP AND THE EU'S NORM PROMOTION TOWARDS SOUTH CAUCASUS COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT DUE TO THE WAY THE EU'S INTERESTS ARE CONSTRUCTED AND DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THE AMBIGUITY OF THE EU'S POLICIES TOWARDS THIS AREA, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CAPACITY TO CONDUCT A NORMATIVE FOREIGN POLICY IS LOW.
254	SINCE THE 9 OF THE 11 EVENTS, THE US AND THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AFGHANISTAN IN ORDER TO FIGHT THE TALIBAN AND REINSTITUTE AFGHAN AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE CASE STUDY OF THE EU POLICE MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN - EUPOL-A - LAUNCHED IN 2007. THE POLICE REFORM IMPLEMENTED BY EUPOL, MODELED ON PREVIOUS POLICE MISSIONS, IS BASED ON THE SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR), WHICH FOCUSES ON IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW BY STRENGTHENING TWO SECTORS: POLICE AND JUDICIARY. AFGHANISTAN IS A UNIQUE CASE STUDY AS IT IS THE FIRST COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY (CSDP) MISSION LAUNCHED IN TIME OF WAR AND ILLUSTRATES DIVERGENT STRATEGIC OPINIONS WITHIN THE EURO-ATLANTIC COMMUNITY. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE OUTCOMES IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE CONSIDERABLE IMPLICATIONS ON THE FUTURE OF THE CSDP IN CIVILIAN MISSIONS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EU AS A CIVILIAN POWER.
255	THIS ARTICLE PROCEEDS IN THREE MAIN PARTS FIRST, IT PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF A MORAL PANIC THAT UNFOLDED DURING A SHORT PERIOD IN THE AUSTRALIAN STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES OVER WARRING MOTORBIKE OR BIKIE GANGS SECOND IT SKETCHES A RECENT HISTORY OF LAWS IN NEW SOUTH WALES THAT HAVE EXPANDED POLICE POWERS INCLUDING ANTI BIKIE GANG LAWS THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW POLICING AND CRIME CONTROL HAS BECOME POLITICISED SINCE 9/11 AND ACCORDINGLY THE EXTENSION OF POLICE POWERS HAS ENTAILED THE BLURRING OF THE FUNCTIONS OF POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES THIS IN TURN RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE RULE OF LAW THIRD THE ARTICLE INTERPRETS THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE BIKIE GANG WARS USING CLASSIC AND MORE RECENT MORAL PANIC THEORY AS WELL AS IDEAS AROUND THE NEW PENOLOGY THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING THE UTILITY OF APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF MORAL PANIC TO THE BIKIE CASE
256	THE RECENT GROWTH IN RESEARCH ON "GOOD GOVERNANCE" AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN PROPELLED BY EMPIRICAL FINDINGS THAT SHOW THAT SUCH INSTITUTIONS MAY HOLD THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN DEVELOPING AND TRANSITION COUNTRIES. WE ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT A KEY ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED, NAMELY, WHAT QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT (QOG) ACTUALLY MEANS AT THE CONCEPTUAL LEVEL. BASED ON ANALYSES OF POLITICAL THEORY, WE PROPOSE A MORE COHERENT AND SPECIFIC DEFINITION OF QOG: THE IMPARTIALITY OF INSTITUTIONS THAT EXERCISE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. WE RELATE THE IDEA OF IMPARTIALITY TO A SERIES OF CRITICISMS STEMMING FROM THE FIELDS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, PUBLIC CHOICE, MULTICULTURALISM, AND FEMINISM. TO PLACE THE THEORY OF IMPARTIALITY IN A LARGER CONTEXT, WE THEN CONTRAST ITS SCOPE AND MEANING WITH THAT OF A THREEFOLD SET OF COMPETING CONCEPTS OF QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT: DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND EFFICIENCY/EFFECTIVENESS.
257	FOR YEARS, NONGOVERNMENTAL TERRORISM IN LATIN AMERICA WAS CONSIDERED AN EPIPHENOMENON OF THE COLD WAR. THE PERSISTENCE OF THIS TYPE OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE 1990S, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY BELIED MANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ITS CAUSES BUT ALSO LED SCHOLARS TO REEXAMINE THE PHENOMENON. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE VALIDITY OF A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES BY APPLYING A POOLED TIME-SERIES CROSS-SECTION REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO DATA FROM 17 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1980 AND 1995. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT NONGOVERNMENTAL TERRORIST ACTS IN LATIN AMERICA ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN POORLY INSTITUTIONALIZED REGIMES CHARACTERIZED BY VARYING DEGREES OF POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL LIBERTIES, A DEFICIENT RULE OF LAW, AND WIDESPREAD HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT NONGOVERNMENTAL TERRORISM IN THE REGION TENDS TO SURFACE IN CYCLICAL WAVES; BUT IT FINDS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OR STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE INCIDENCE OF NONGOVERNMENTAL TERRORISM.
258	THERE IS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IS GOVERNANCE INFUSED WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF, INTER ALIA, EQUITY, PARTICIPATION, RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS AT ITS VERY CORE THE EXPANSION OF PEOPLE'S CHOICES AND THEIR INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THEIR LIVES. THEREFORE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE REINFORCES HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REINFORCES DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. EXTERNAL PARTNERS-THOSE ACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS-CAN POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO A COUNTRY'S TRANSITION TO AND CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE (AND, THEREBY, ITS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT) IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. EXTERNAL PARTNERS ACT THROUGH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE ENTRY POINTS TO DELIVER STRATEGIC SERVICES AND USE INDICATORS TO MEASURE THEIR RELATIVE PROGRESS. INDICATORS CAN BE VALUABLE TOOLS IN INFORMING EXTERNAL PARTNERS AND RECIPIENTS OF ASSISTANCE OF WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOES NOT WORK AND WHY. COPYRIGHT (C) 2001 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
259	POST-COLONIAL AFRICA HAS BEEN CAUGHT IN MILITARY COUPS AND CIVIL WARS. INCUMBENT LEADERS HAVE REFUSED TO STEP DOWN AND HAND OVER POWER POST-ELECTIONS OR AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO NOT GET VOTED OUT OF POWER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THREE MAIN CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA ARE MILITARY COUPS, LACK OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND ILLEGAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO ENTRENCH DE FACTO MONARCHY. TO COMBAT THIS, THE MALABO PROTOCOL, WHICH INTRODUCES CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OF THE AFRICAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, CRIMINALISES UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT ('UCG'). THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE PROGRESSION OF UCG FROM A VIOLATION OF THE DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES UNDER THE AFRICAN CHARTER TO A PROSECUTABLE CRIME UNDER THE MALABO PROTOCOL AND ANALYSES THE DIFFICULTIES AN ACTUAL PROSECUTION WILL FACE ON ACCOUNT OF VAGUE DEFINITION, LACK OF INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION AND THE MAJOR ROADBLOCK DUE TO HEADS OF STATE IMMUNITY UNDER THE PROTOCOL.
260	GROWTH IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF A BUSINESS. REGRETTABLY, THE IMPACT OF FAMILY INFLUENCE ON FIRM GROWTH IS LARGELY NEGLECTED. WE EXAMINE WHETHER FAMILY FIRMS HAVE A HIGHER GROWTH RATE THAN THEIR NONFAMILY COUNTERPARTS. BASED ON A LARGE SAMPLE OF FIRMS ACROSS 43 COUNTRIES OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD, WE SHOW THAT FAMILY FIRMS ON AVERAGE HAVE HIGHER GROWTH RATES THAN NONFAMILY FIRMS, AND THIS POSITIVE EFFECT IS GREATER FOR FAMILY FIRMS OPERATING IN STRONG NATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS WHICH ARE LESS CORRUPT, MORE DEMOCRATIC, MORE SUBJECT TO RULE OF LAW, AND HAVE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT POLICIES. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF FAMILY INFLUENCE ON FIRM GROWTH VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAMILY FIRMS AND DIFFERENT BUSINESS CYCLES. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT FAMILY CONTROL HAS AN ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROWTH RATES AND IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH FAMILY FIRM THEORY AND PRACTICE.
261	IN THIS ARTICLE WE ESTIMATE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PHYSICAL CAPITAL STOCK, HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK, OPENNESS AND LIBERALISATION IN ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE FOUR MAJOR ECONOMIES OF SOUTH ASIA. WE APPLY BOTH TIME SERIES AND PANEL DATA ANALYSIS FOR ESTIMATION. THE TIME SERIES ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT PHYSICAL CAPITAL STOCK POSITIVELY INFLUENCES ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE FOUR MAJOR SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES. THE INFLUENCE OF THE OTHER FACTORS VARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRIES IN THE LONG RUN. WHEN WE CONTROL FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, THE SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT DIMINISHES FOR EVERY COUNTRY. THE PANEL DATA ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATION IMPART POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE WHILE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW IMPARTS NEGATIVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON PCGDP OF THE COUNTRIES. THE STUDY SHOWS THE NEED FOR HIGHER INVESTMENT IN HUMAN CAPITAL, PHYSICAL CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IN SOUTH ASIA NEEDS ATTENTION, TO SUSTAIN GROWTH IN FUTURE.
262	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EVALUATES THE INTERPLAY AMONG COURTS WITH CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION IN ASIA. THIS IS DONE IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ASIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS (AACC). THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE AACC HAS TO DATE MADE ONLY A NOMINAL CONTRIBUTION TO CULTIVATING INTER-COURT RELATIONS IN FURTHERANCE OF COMMON GOALS AND ADVANCES THE CLAIM THAT ITS MEMBERS OUGHT TO RECTIFY THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS. ON THE ONE HAND, TRANSNATIONAL JUDICIAL ALLIANCES HAVE INSTRUMENTAL VALUE FOR PARTICIPATING COURTS IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR MANDATE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AACC CAN BE A USEFUL CONDUIT IN NURTURING AN ASIAN PERSPECTIVE TO THE GLOBAL JUDICIAL DISCOURSE ON CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. IN THAT VEIN, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE MOST SUITABLE MEANS TO ENABLE THE AACC TO OPTIMALLY DISCHARGE ITS ROLE TO HELP ADVANCE RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REGION.
263	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE GROWING TREND TO ENFORCE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AGREEMENTS OR WHAT I THINK ARE MORE FELICITOUSLY CALLED "REMEDIAL CLAUSES." I CRITICIZE THIS TREND ON THE GROUNDS THAT A PERMISSIVE APPROACH TO ENFORCING REMEDIAL CLAUSES CONTRAVENES IMPORTANT PUBLIC VALUES. ALTHOUGH MANY HAVE CLAIMED THE TRADITIONAL PRESUMPTION AGAINST SUCH CLAUSES IS MYSTERIOUS OR UNSUPPORTED, I CONTEND THAT THE TRADITIONAL PRESUMPTION AGAINST SUCH CLAUSES ENFORCES IMPORTANT VALUES CENTRAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THAT PRIVATE PARTIES SHOULD NOT DECIDE THEIR OWN CASES AND THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A SPECIAL INTEREST IN DECIDING WHAT REMEDIES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR BREACHES OF LEGAL DUTY. IN DELINEATING THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR TREATING REMEDIAL CLAUSES DIFFERENTLY THAN PERFORMANCE TERMS, I OFFER A DISTINCTIVE, LIBERAL, AND DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE ON CONTRACT AND CONTRACTUAL BREACH THAT ANSWERS THE COMMON ARGUMENTS OFFERED BY LIBERTARIANS AND LAW AND ECONOMICS SCHOLARS THAT FREEDOM OF CONTRACT REQUIRES THE CONTRARY.
264	IN THE SOCIAL CONTRACT, ROUSSEAU DECLARES THAT HE HAS GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF DISCUSSING THE EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF STATES. YET NUMEROUS TEXTSINCLUDING A RECENTLY RECONSTITUTED WORK ABOUT THE LAW OF WARSHOW THAT HE THOUGHT VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF WAR AND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING WAR SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. ROUSSEAU, IN CONTRAST TO HOBBES, LINKS WAR'S APPEARANCE TO THAT OF THE SOVEREIGN STATES; THE STATE OF WAR IS THEREFORE THE NECESSARY RESULT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. MOREOVER, HE CONSIDERS THE INTERNATIONAL LAW AS CHIMERICAL. HOW CAN HE THEN CONCEIVE A NON-UTOPIAN THEORY OF JUST WAR? MY HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HIS CONCEPTION OF THE LAW OF WAR IS DEDUCED FROM PRINCIPLES OF INTERNAL POLITICAL LAW AND ARISES FROM PRAGMATIC NECESSITY. THE STATE THAT DISCREDITS ITSELF IN ITS MANNER OF WAGING WAR WEAKENS ITSELF WHILE BELIEVING THAT IT IS REINFORCING ITSELF.
265	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT I CALL RELATIONAL JUSTICE, THE TYPE OF JUSTICE GROUNDED ON THE EMERGENCE OF PATTERNS OR SOCIAL RULES WHICH MAY BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL MODELS OF THE STATE. STEMMING FROM TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF MODELS - THE LEGAL MODELS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THOSE COMING FROM POLITICAL REPUBLICANISM-THIS PAPER STATES THE POSSIBILITY TO GROUND NEW POLITICAL BEHAVIORS AND FORMS ISSUED WITHIN THE EVOLUTION OF THE WEB 2.0 AND 3.0 ON DIALOGUE AND DIALOGICAL MODELS. SOME HUMANISTIC FORMS OF DIALECTICAL THINKING ARE THEREFORE COMING BACK AFTER HAVING BEEN ERASED FROM THE POLITICAL THOUGHT SINCE THE 16 C. BY THE POST-WESTPHALIAN STATES LEGAL FORMULAE. SOME SPECIFIC AND RECENT CASES OF WEB DISTRIBUTED PROBLEM SOLVING (POLITICAL CROWDSOURCING) ARE ANALYZED, SUCH AS SOCIAL MAPPING WITH USHAHIDI, AN OPEN PLATFORM TO MAP NATURAL DISASTERS AND VIOLENT CONFLICTS (EGYPT, LIBYA, SOMALIA).
266	THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON THE BRAM FISHER MEMORIAL LECTURE, DELIVERED IN NEW COLLEGE OXFORD IN NOVEMBER 2008. IT DRAWS ON MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AS A HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER IN ZIMBABWE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2008, AND DOCUMENTS THE ATTEMPTS MADE BY MYSELF AND OTHER LEGAL PRACTITIONERS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FACE OF CONSTANT ASSAULT ON THE PART OF THE STATE. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF THE EVENTS THAT PROVOKED MY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REALM OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, DESCRIBES MY BATTLES WITH THE CHIMANIMANI POLICE AND CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION (CIO) AS I ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT ROY BENNETT AND OTHER MDC MEMBERS. IT SPELLS OUT THE PERSECUTION THAT HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS RECEIVED, EXAMINES STATE PROPAGANDA AGAINST ZIMBABWE LAWYERS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE EFFORTS TO DERAIL THEIR WORK THROUGH VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, AS WELL AS DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF THIS ONSLAUGHT ON COLLEAGUES AND THEIR FAMILIES.
267	IN ITS BURMYCH AND OTHERS V. UKRAINE JUDGMENT OF OCTOBER 2017 THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS DISMISSED MORE THAN 12,000 APPLICATIONS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT ONLY REPETITIVE IN NATURE, BUT ALSO MUTATIS MUTANDIS IDENTICAL TO APPLICATIONS COVERED BY A PREVIOUS PILOT JUDGMENT RENDERED AGAINST UKRAINE. THIS RAISES FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AS TO THE ROLE OF THE COURT WITHIN THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL AS THOSE CONCERNING THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COURT AND THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS.
268	TO FIGHT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS EFFECTIVELY, GOVERNMENTS REQUIRE SUPPORT FROM SIGNIFICANT SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY. CITIZEN SUPPORT PROVIDES IMPORTANT LEVERAGE FOR EXECUTIVES, ALLOWING THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR POLICIES. YET WINNING CITIZENS' HEARTS AND MINDS IS NOT EASY. PUBLIC SECURITY IS A DEEPLY COMPLEX ISSUE. RESPONSIBILITY IS SHARED AMONG DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT; INFORMATION IS HIGHLY MEDIATED BY MASS MEDIA AND INDIVIDUAL ACQUAINTANCES; AND SECURITY HAS A STRONG EFFECT ON PEOPLES' EMOTIONS, SINCE IT THREATENS TO AFFECT THEIR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS-LIFE AND PROPERTY. HOW DO CITIZENS TRANSLATE THEIR ASSESSMENTS OF PUBLIC SECURITY INTO PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS STUDY DEVELOPS EXPLICIT THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF PUBLIC SECURITY AFFECT PRESIDENTIAL APPROVAL. THE ARGUMENTS ARE TESTED USING MEXICO AS A CASE STUDY.
269	MOST LEGAL SYSTEMS DENY CIVILIANS A RIGHT TO COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES THEY SUSTAIN DURING BELLIGERENT ACTIVITIES. ARGUMENTS FOR RECOGNISING SUCH A RIGHT ARE USUALLY DIVORCED, TO VARIOUS DEGREES, FROM THE MORAL AND LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE NOTION OF INFLICTING A WRONGFUL LOSS UNDER EITHER INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW OR DOMESTIC TORT LAW. MY AIM IN THIS ARTICLE IS TO ADVANCE A NOVEL ACCOUNT OF STATES' TORTIOUS LIABILITY FOR BELLIGERENT WRONGDOING, DRAWING ON BOTH INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND CORRECTIVE JUSTICE APPROACHES TO DOMESTIC TORT LAW. STRUCTURING MY ACCOUNT ON BOTH FRAMEWORKS, I ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE LOSSES THAT STATES INFLICT DURING WAR ARE PRIVATE LAW WRONGS THAT ESTABLISH A CLAIM OF COMPENSATION IN TORT. ONLY IN CASES WHERE THE IN BELLO PRINCIPLES ARE OBSERVED CAN LOSSES TO PERSON AND PROPERTY BE JUSTIFIED AND NON-WRONGFUL. OTHERWISE, THEY CONSTITUTE WRONGS, WHICH THOSE WHO INFLICT THEM HAVE DUTIES OF CORRECTIVE JUSTICE TO REPAIR.
270	BUKAVU IS A RAPIDLY GROWING CITY IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED EAST OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. IT IS HOME TO LARGE NUMBERS OF INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS). THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THESE IDPS AND EXPLORES THE STRATEGIES THEY USE TO CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS AND SETTLE THEIR EVERYDAY DISPUTES. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON A SOCIOLEGAL RESEARCH PROJECT FOR WHICH DATA COLLECTION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN MAY 2015 AND JUNE 2016. THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT HARDLY ANY ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED TO IDPS IN BUKAVU AND BOTH STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ON THEIR SITUATION. OUR DATA SHOW THAT THE MOBILIZATION OF PERSONAL CONNECTIONS IS KEY FOR IDPS TO FIND JUSTICE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. HELPING IDPS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKS IN TOWN COULD BE A STRATEGY FOR POLICY MAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS TO IMPROVE IDP'S ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND TO BETTER RESPECT THEIR RIGHTS.
271	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF CROSS-LISTING IN THE US ON DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY OF THE CROSS-LISTED STOCKS. WE USE A SAMPLE OF FIRMS FROM 31 DEVELOPED AND EMERGING ECONOMIES THAT CROSS-LISTED THEIR SHARES ON MAJOR US STOCK EXCHANGES THROUGH AN AMERICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPT (ADR) PRO-GRAM BETWEEN 1998 AND 2020. THE STUDY FINDS THAT DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY FOLLOWING A US CROSS-LISTING FOR BOTH DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKET FIRMS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FOR FIRMS IN DEVELOPED MARKETS, DOMESTIC TRADING ACTIVITY DECREASES BEFORE AND DURING THE CROSS-LISTING YEAR. HOWEVER, IT INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LONG-TERM, SUGGESTING EVIDENCE OF THE 'FLOW BACK' EFFECT. FOR FIRMS IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, THE ANTICIPATORY, IMPACT, INTERMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY ARE ALL SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE. WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE FOR THE 'BONDING HYPOTHESIS' SUGGESTING THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY ARE GREATER FOR CROSS -LISTED FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH LOW RULE OF LAW, WEAK INVESTOR PROTECTION AND BAD QUALITY OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION LONG-TERM.
272	THE PAPER PROVIDES A CASE STUDY ON HOW THE ORBAN REGIME IN HUNGARY HAS DEALT WITH CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) IN 2020-2021. DESPITE HAVING LED WORLDWIDE RANKINGS IN PANDEMIC-RELATED DEATH RATES SINCE THE SECOND PART OF 2020, THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT POLITICALLY SHAKEN BY COVID-19. INSTITUTIONALLY UNRESTRAINED, THE GOVERNING MAJORITY PERIODICALLY RENEWED EMERGENCY LEGAL REGIMES TO CONTROL PUBLIC DISCOURSES AND CURTAIL THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF OPPOSITION-LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE POLICY CONDUCT OF THE REGIME IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM, WHICH IS CONCEPTUALIZED ALONG A STRATEGY-BASED APPROACH TO POPULISM. IN THIS, AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM IS SEEN TO GENERATE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY FOR DISMANTLING THE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS HAD BEEN HAPPENING IN HUNGARY WELL BEFORE COVID-19 KICKED IN, BUT THE PANDEMIC PROVIDED ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS STRATEGY. MEANWHILE, FISCAL POLICIES BECAME INCREASINGLY EXPANSIONARY, SIGNALLING A PARTIAL RETURN TO THE PRACTICE OF PREELECTION OVERSPENDING.
273	THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN THE SEXES IS NOT ONLY A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT BUT IT ALSO IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT ALL OTHER AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES ON EMPLOYMENT INEQUALITY IN TURKEY. THEREFORE, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICT APPLICATIONS AND FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION IS INVESTIGATED WITH THE AUTO REGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (ARDL) MODEL AND IMPULSE RESPONSE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE IS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THE FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE FOR THE PERIOD 1988-2018. THESE FINDINGS MAY SUGGEST THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALSO NEED TO HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND THE RULE OF LAW TO BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES OFFER TO EMPOWER THE WHOLE SOCIETY INCLUDING WOMEN.
274	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON GOVERNMENTS' ATTEMPTS TO INTENSIFY CRISES FOR POLITICAL GAIN, AND IDENTIFIES A SERIES OF UNNECESSARY CRISIS MANAGEMENT RESPONSES THAT FOLLOW DISTINCTIVE POLICY OVERREACTION STYLES. IT IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT POLITICAL EXECUTIVES AT TIMES FACE INCENTIVES TO SHAPE VOTERS' PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE TIMING AND SCOPE OF A CRISIS, EVEN THOUGH NO CRISIS ACTUALLY EXISTS. ANALYSING TRUMP'S RESPONSE TOWARDS THE SO-CALLED 'INVASION' BY A CARAVAN OF ASYLUM SEEKERS, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THREE DISTINCTIVE CRISIS OVERREACTION POLICY STYLES: COMMUNICATING IN ABSOLUTES, PERFORMING IN ABSOLUTES, AND CHALLENGING THE RULE OF LAW. EACH OF THESE OVERREACTION STYLES INCLUDES A SPECIFIC SET OF TOOL PREFERENCES; AN ACTIVE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION; AND AN IMPOSITIONAL MANNER OF EXECUTION. BY HIGHLIGHTING THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF MARRYING THE CONCEPT OF CRISIS TO THE IDEAS OF POLICY OVERREACTION AND POLICY STYLE, THIS ARTICLE MAKES AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE POLITICS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT.
275	IN THIS ARTICLE WE ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CROSS-BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND THE QUALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING ON DOMESTIC INVESTMENT USING PANEL DATA FOR 22 EUROPEAN TRANSITION COUNTRIES FROM 2000 TO 2014. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE PROGRESS AND DURABILITY OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS HAVE A CRUCIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF CROSS BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES. OUR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CONTEMPORANEOUS CROSS-BORDER MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS HAVE A CROWDING-OUT EFFECT ON DOMESTIC INVESTMENT IN THE YEAR OF MERGER OR ACQUISITION, BUT THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR LAGGED LEVEL HAS A STRONG CROWDING-IN EFFECT ONE YEAR LATER. WE FIND THAT THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING AND THE RULE OF LAW NEGATIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN. POLITICAL STABILITY EXHIBITS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DOMESTIC INVESTMENT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND OVER TIME.
276	POLITICAL COMMENTATORS CLAIM THAT THE RULE OF LAW RELIES, IN PART, ON THOSE BOUND BY LAW HAVING A SENSE OF SHAME. I ELUCIDATE SHAME'S UNDERLYING STRUCTURE AND ITS ROLE IN LAW'S RULE THROUGH A STUDY OF AIDS IN PLATO'S LAWS AND PHAEDRUS. THE GREEK AIDS NAMES A FEELING IN WHICH ONE PULLS BACK FROM VIOLATING A LIMIT. IT SIGNIFIES SHAME, BUT ALSO REVERENCE, AWE, AND MODESTY. I ARGUE THAT AIDS IS AN AFFECT IN WHICH WE PAUSE BEFORE LIMITS AND ARE INVITED TO A PERCEPTION OF THE WHOLE, WHETHER IT BE OUR LIVES OR THE POLITY OR THE COSMOS, WHICH ANIMATES AND IS CONSTITUTED BY THOSE LIMITS. I THEN IDENTIFY AN IMPLICIT SENSE OF AIDS IN THE LAWS: REVERENCE FOR THE LAW-BOUND POLITY AS A FRAGILE WHOLE. SUCH REVERENCE SHARES SHAME'S BARE STRUCTURE, BUT OFFERS AFFECTIVE SUPPORT FOR LAW'S RULE THAT IS LESS VULNERABLE TO SHAME'S MORALIZING AND EXCLUSIONARY EFFECTS.
277	PUBLIC LAW SCHOLARSHIP IN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION OFTEN AIMS AT ELUCIDATING A CONNECTION BETWEEN LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES LIKE EQUALITY, DUE PROCESS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, IN THEIR QUEST TO REVEAL THE MORALITY OF PUBLIC LAW, COMMON LAWYERS OFTEN FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER SOURCES OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE TRADITIONAL FASCINATION WITH COURTS AS THE PRIMARY OR EXCLUSIVE ARBITERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES SHOULD BE TEMPERED AND SUPPLEMENTED BY RECOGNIZING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS WHO INTERPRET AND ENFORCE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS WHEN EXERCISING STATUTORILY DELEGATED LEGAL AUTHORITY. BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND TRIBUNAL IN ADVANCING EQUALITY RIGHTS, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT RECENT DECISIONS FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA WHICH RECOMMEND JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO REASONABLE, PROPORTIONATE, AND CONTEXTUALLY SENSITIVE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS CONCERNING HUMAN RIGHTS, INSTEAD OF RESORTING REFLEXIVELY TO CORRECTNESS REVIEW, WILL SERVE TO STRENGTHEN THE MORAL UNITY OF CANADIAN PUBLIC LAW.
278	DURING GUATEMALA'S 36-YEAR-LONG CIVIL WAR (1960-1996), CANADA'S ROLE IN RESPONSE TO THE CONFLICT DIVERGED FROM THE UNITED STATES' REALPOLITIK. IN CONTRAST TO U.S. POLICY OBJECTIVES DURING THE COLD WAR, THE CANADIAN DISTINCTIVENESS IN GUATEMALA WAS PREVALENT IN THE REALM OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY. THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY CONDEMNED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN GUATEMALA, SUPPORTED THE VARIOUS PHASES OF THE PEACE PROCESS, AND PARTICIPATED IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, SINCE 2003-2004, THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAS PROMOTED MINING INVESTMENTS TO THE DETRIMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CIVIL SOCIETY HAS DETERIORATED BOTH AT HOME AND IN GUATEMALA. THIS SHIFT CAN BE LINKED TO A SECURITIZATION PROCESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN THE NEOLIBERAL ORDER IN LATIN AMERICA AND A CHANGE IN THE IDENTITY-BASED INTEREST OF CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY DURING PRIME MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER'S ERA (2006-2015).
279	I DOCUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF DISCONTINUITIES IN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES OF SATELLITE-RECORDED NIGHTTIME LIGHTS PER CAPITA ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS, WITH GROWTH RATES OF NIGHTTIME LIGHTS INCREASING ABRUPTLY AS ONE CROSSES A BORDER FROM A SLOWER-GROWING COUNTRY INTO A FASTER-GROWING ONE. I SHOW THAT GROWTH DISCONTINUITIES ARE NOT DRIVEN BY ANY SPECIAL SET OF BORDERS, OR BY DIFFERENCES IN GEOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC CONDITIONS ON THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF BORDERS. I INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE EXPLANATIONS FOR GROWTH DISCONTINUITIES, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE DETERMINANTS OF GROWTH ACROSS BORDERS AND DIFFERENCES IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH BORDERS FORM BARRIERS TO FLOWS OF GOODS, CAPITAL OR PEOPLE. I PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE CONSISTENTLY HELPFUL IN EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN GROWTH BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES AT THEIR BORDER, AND CONCLUDE THAT NATIONAL-LEVEL VARIABLES SUCH AS INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES MAY HAVE RAPID AND IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON GROWTH.
280	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE USES AND CONSEQUENCES OF BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN SOCIAL CONTROL. AFTER TACKLING THE ISSUE OF DEFINING "BIG DATA", THE PAPER PRESENTS THE IMPLICATIONS OF BIG DATA IN THE PRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE. IT THEN FOCUSES ON SELECTED DOMAINS OF INFORMAL AND FORMAL SOCIAL CONTROL, SUCH AS POLICING AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE BEING RESHAPED BY BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS. BY FOCUSING ON THE IMPACTS OF PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS ON ECONOMIC-POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE BEING RESHAPED INTO AN "ALGORCRACY" THE RULE OF THE ALGORITHM. THIS PAPER THEN FOCUSES ON AUTOMATIZATION IN POLICING AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SETTINGS BY PRESENTING SPECIFIC PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS ALREADY IN USE OR IN TESTING IN PRE-TRAIL DETENTION, SENTENCING, AND PAROLE PROCEDURES. IT CONCLUDES BY PRESENTING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BIG DATA AND PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN SOCIAL CONTROL AND BY OFFERING REMEDIES FOR SUCH.
281	ISLAM IS A KIND OF RELIGION THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF AS A POLITICAL, JURIDICAL AND SOCIAL ORDER. THEREFORE, ISLAM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SECULAR STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS WITH A FREE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ORDER. THIS KIND OF POLITICAL AND JURIDICAL ORDER IS AN OUTCOME OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT THE RISE OF WHICH CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD ON THE BACKGROUND OF CIVILIZATION SHAPED BY CHRISTIANITY AND ITS GENUINE DUALISM OF RELIGION AND POLITICS, SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL POWER. ISLAM IS IN MANY ASPECTS THE ANTITHESIS OF SUCH A CIVILIZATION. YET, TO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF ISLAM, INCREASINGLY PRESENT IN EUROPEAN SOCIETIES, NEITHER A CHRISTIAN NOR A NATIONAL "LEITKULTUR" (GUIDING CULTURE) IS REQUIRED. THE LIBERAL SECULAR STATE ONLY DEMANDS ABIDANCE BY THE LAWS AND THE RULES OF SOCIAL EXISTENCE. TO FULLY ACCEPT THIS, HOWEVER, ISLAM MUST TURN INTO A RELIGION IN THE EUROPEAN-CHRISTIAN SENSE, GIVING UP ITS PRETENTION TO ESTABLISH A JURIDICAL AND SOCIAL ORDER BASED ON ITS RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS.
282	DURING THE 19TH CENTURY THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO WERE LIVING BASICALLY UNDER THE ARBITRARY ATTITUDE OF MEN AND NOT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE DESPOTISM OR AUTOCRATIC POSITION OF THE GOVERNORS WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE LAW. OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM EXISTED IN A PLACID IGNORANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION, ESPECIALLY FOR SLAVES, PRIMARILY THE CHILDREN. THUS, THE LAW, IN GENERAL, LOST ITS SENSE OF MAJESTY OR GRANDEUR OR JUSTICE; IT BECAME VARIABLE, CAPRICIOUS, ARBITRARY, SENSELESS: DEAD. IT WAS NOT, ANYMORE, A PRINCIPLE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE COMMON INDIVIDUALS: AS A RULE OF CONDUCT OR ACTION ESTABLISHED BY CUSTOM OR LAID DOWN BY A GOVERNING AUTHORITY. INSTEAD, THE PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNING BODY SAW THE LAW NOT ONLY AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER AND CONTROL, BUT ALSO, OF FEAR AND OPPRESSION. THE DEPRIVATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, LIBERTIES, INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF CHILDREN SLAVES, WHO WERE THE MOST AFFECTED, CONTINUED UP TO 1873, WHEN THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WAS FINALLY DECLARED IN PUERTO RICO,
283	THE UE IS FOUNDED ON A SET OF VALUES WHICH ARE MENTIONED IN AN EXPLICIT MANNER IN ART. 2 OF THE TEU: RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. VALUES WHICH THE SAME ARTICLE STATES THAT ARE COMMON TO THE MEMBER STATES. UNTIL NOW, THE PROTECTION OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES IS BASED ON THE MECHANISM FORESEEN IN ART. 7 OF THE TEU. THE EXISTENCE OF THIS MECHANISM THOUGH HAS NOT PREVENTED THE VIOLATION OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES BY SEVERAL OF THE MEMBER STATES FROM TAKING PLACE. THIS IS WHY THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHING OF A NEW MECHANISM - THE "COPENHAGEN MECHANISM" - WHICH WOULD BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MEMBER STATES ON A PERMANENT BASIS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE VIOLATIONS FROM TAKING PLACE, BUT WHICH WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE THE MOST SERIOUS PENALTIES TO THE MOST SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, INCLUDING THE EXPULSION OF THE UE.
284	THIS PAPER PROVIDES A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF A SCANDAL THAT BROKE IN MEXICO FOLLOWING PUBLICATION OF A BOOK THAT ACCUSED BUSINESSMEN AND POLITICIANS OF INVOLVEMENT IN CHILD TRAFFICKING AND PAEDOPHILIA. THE BOOK'S AUTHOR, LYDIA CACHO, WAS ABDUCTED, IMPRISONED, THREATENED WITH VIOLENCE AND CHARGED WITH DEFAMATION. AS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF COMPLICITY IN THE PROTECTION OF PAEDOPHILE RINGS SURFACED, A FIRESTORM OF PUBLIC ANGER AND MEDIA SCRUTINY FOCUSSED ON THE PLIGHT OF CACHO AND KEY POLITICAL FIGURES INCLUDING A STATE GOVERNOR. A RARE POLITICAL SPACE WAS THUS OPENED FOR A DEBATE ON CHILD RIGHTS. YET IT WAS A SPACE THAT CSOS AND CHILD RIGHTS NETWORKS FAILED TO EXPLOIT. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW CHILD RIGHTS DISCOURSE HAD LIMITED SALIENCE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CSOS WERE COMPROMISED, UNCOMMITTED AND DISUNITED. DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF A 'RIGHTS EFFECT', WE ARGUE THAT ADVOCACY FOR CHILD RIGHTS MUST NOT ASSUME A NATURAL FELLOWSHIP WITH DISCOURSES OF HUMAN RIGHTS GENERALLY, OR WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS, PRESS FREEDOMS AND RULE OF LAW.
285	THE UN AND THE WTO WERE EACH THE BRAINCHILD OF ONE IDEAL: THE IDEAL OF BUILDING A PEACEFUL LIBERAL WORLD ORDER. ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND OPENNESS ARE INDISPENSABLE ELEMENTS OF THIS NEW WORLD ORDER. BY PROVIDING A RULES-BASED SYSTEM FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE, AND BY INCREASING THE OPENNESS OF ITS MEMBERS' ECONOMIES, THE WTO CONTRIBUTES TO THE REALIZATION OF THIS IDEAL. THE WTO CANNOT FULFILL THIS FUNCTION WITHOUT THE COMMITMENT OF ITS MEMBER STATES. GOOD INTERNATIONAL CITIZENS ARE THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE ORGANIZATION IN ITS OBJECTIVES. GOOD CITIZENS ARE THOSE WHO PURSUE OPEN POLICIES, AND WHO ACTIVELY AND CONSTRUCTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION. THROUGH ITS INCREASINGLY OPEN TRADE REGIME, FULL COMMITMENT TO THE DOHA DEVELOPMENT AGENDA NEGOTIATIONS, AND ITS RESPECT FOR, AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE DECISIONS OF WTO JUDICIAL ORGANS, TURKEY IS INCREASINGLY FULFILLING ITS DUTIES TOWARDS THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY AS A GOOD INTERNATIONAL CITIZEN.
286	INFLAMMATION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR ADVERSE EFFECTS OF FINE PARTICULATE MATTER (PM2.5) ON THE LUNG SYSTEM; HOWEVER, ITS MECHANISMS REMAIN UNCLEAR. RATS WERE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF PM2.5 TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM OF SHORT-TERM EXPOSURE-INDUCED LUNG INFLAMMATION. THE REGULATION OF PI3K-AKT AND DNA METHYL-TRANSFERASE 3B (DNMT3B) WAS ASSESSED BY USING A PI3K INHIBITOR AND A DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE INHIBITOR. WE FOUND THAT PM2.5 COULD DECREASE INTERFERON-GAMMA (IFN-GAMMA) LEVELS AND INCREASE INTERLEUKIN 4 (IL-4), IL-5 AND IL-13 LEVELS IN BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE FLUID (BALF) TO PROMOTE EOSINOPHIL INFILTRATION AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO ALLERGIC PUL-MONARY INFLAMMATION. MOREOVER, THE CPG ISLAND METHYLATION RATE OF THE IFN-GAMMA PROMOTER AND THE PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF DNMT3B, PI3K AND P-AKT WERE INCREASED IN LUNG TISSUES AFTER PM2.5 EXPOSURE. BOTH INHIBITORS REVERSED THE CPG ISLAND HYPERMETHYLATION OF IFN-GAMMA. IN CONCLUSION, IN PM2.5-INDUCED LUNG INJURY, THE ACTIVATED PI3K-AKT PATHWAY, VIA AN INCREASE IN DNMT3B EXPRESSION, IS INVOLVED IN CPG HYPERMETHYLATION OF THE IFN-GAMMA GENE PROMOTER.
287	FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE CONGOLESE ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING (ASM) SECTOR HAS BEEN UNDERGOING REFORMS OF ITS GOVERNING STRUCTURES. A RECURRENT ARGUMENT SUPPORTING THE REFORMS - PREDOMINANTLY IN THE 3T ASM SECTOR (I.E. TIN, TANTALUM AND TUNGSTEN) - IS THAT ARTISANAL MINING FEEDS VIOLENCE (INCLUDING SEXUAL VIOLENCE), CONFLICTS, UNDERDEVELOPMENT, AND POVERTY. THE REFORMS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN TURN HAS TRIGGERED EMPIRICAL POLICY AND ADVOCACY RESEARCHES. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REFORMS. THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE FINDINGS GATHERED FROM THE LITERATURE ON THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE STATE IN GOVERNING 3T MINING. IT ARGUES THAT IN THE STUDY AREAS (I.E. NORTH-KIVU, SOUTH-KIVU AND TANGANYIKA), THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE STATE IN GOVERNING ARTISANAL MINING TEND TO BE SIMILAR, COMPLEX, AND ROOTED IN THE MINING HISTORY OF EASTERN DRC. RECENT ARMED CONFLICTS HAVE ONLY ADDED NEW LAYERS TO EXISTING CHALLENGES. IN ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES AND GIVEN THEIR COMPLEXITY, THE STATE HAS SUCCEEDED IN SOME AREAS BUT HAS FAILED IN PUTTING IN PLACE A COHERENT `MODEL' FOR GOVERNING THE 3T ASM SECTOR.
288	ON 4 JULY 2023, THE THIRD SECTION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) DELIVERED THE FIRST JUDGMENT ON THE COMPATIBILITY OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WITH HUMAN RIGHTS IN GLUKHIN V. RUSSIA. THE CASE CONCERNED THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY (FRT) AGAINST MR GLUKHIN FOLLOWING HIS SOLO DEMONSTRATION IN THE MOSCOW UNDERGROUND. THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY FOUND A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (RIGHT TO RESPECT FOR PRIVATE LIFE) AND ARTICLE 10 (FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION) OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR). REGARDING FRT, THE COURT CONCLUDED THAT THE USE OF HIGHLY INTRUSIVE TECHNOLOGY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE IDEALS AND VALUES OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CASE NOTE ANALYSES THE JUDGMENT AND SHOWS ITS RELEVANCE IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY DEBATE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SYSTEMS IN EUROPE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DECISION, WE ARGUE THAT THE COURT HAS LEFT CRUCIAL QUESTIONS UNANSWERED.(C) 2023 FRANCESCA PALMIOTTO AND NATALIA MENENDEZ GONZALEZ. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

289	A STRONG CIVIL SOCIETY IS A MANIFESTATION OF DEVELOPED DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND LAW. A DEVELOPED CIVIL SOCIETY IS ONE OF THE IDENTIFIERS OF EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES, AN EXAMPLE OF A MODERN STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, TO THE LEVEL OF WHICH MANY COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD STRIVE TO GROW. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF UKRAINIAN CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CHALLENGES DURING THE PRESIDENCY OF VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. ON THE ONE HAND, THIS TEXT STUDIES THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS IN VARIOUS SPHERES OF THE STATE APPARATUS, JUDICIAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS ANALYZED HOW CIVIL SOCIETY BECOMES ONE OF THE "SHADOW" GEOPOLITICAL PLAYERS THAT HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE ADOPTION OF KEY DECISIONS IN THE RUSSO -UKRAINIAN WAR. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES POSSIBLE DANGERS/RISKS/CHALLENGES FACED BY UKRAINIAN CIVIL SOCIETY DURING AND AFTER THE RUSSO -UKRAINIAN WAR.
290	RESEARCH NOTES THE BROAD COMPLICITY OF WHITE PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN HISTORICAL RACIAL VIOLENCE AND REPRESSION. THESE DISCUSSIONS EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACTORS IN PERPETRATING AND ENABLING THIS REPRESSION. EXTENDING THIS ASSESSMENT, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE CORONERS' FACILITATION OF WHITE RACIAL DOMINANCE THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE PERFORMANCES CONSTRUCTING WHITE INNOCENCE. USING CASES FROM POST-EMANCIPATION SOUTH CAROLINA, THE AUTHORS DOCUMENT RACE-RELATED PATTERNS OF EXCULPATORY EFFORT, THROUGH THE OMISSION AND CURATION OF EVIDENCE AMID THE POST-RECONSTRUCTION RISE OF WHITE SUPREMACIST REDEMPTION. THE AUTHORS THEORIZE THAT THESE EXCULPATORY EFFORTS HELPED SUSTAIN AN IDEOLOGY OF WHITE INNOCENCE AND INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY BY CONSTRUCTING A WHITE "LAW-ABIDING" PUBLIC. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT SUCH CORONER MISCONDUCT NOT ONLY DEGRADES THE RULE OF LAW BUT HAS BROADER IMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING ITS CORRUPTION OF THE CORPUS OF MORTALITY AND CRIME DATA. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT THESE ADMINISTRATIVE PERFORMANCES PERSIST IN PRESENT-DAY CORONER REPORTING, INCLUDING IN THE EXCULPATION OF RACIST POLICE VIOLENCE.
291	THE MEXICAN RULE OF LAW REQUIRES ESTABLISHING A LEGAL CONCEPT THAT DESCRIBE IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY THE "COLLABORATIVE ECONOMIES" IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE TRUE COLLABORATIVE ECONOMIES BASED ON THE COMMON GOOD, WHICH HELP IN THE SOLUTION OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS. THIS WOULD ALLOW TO CLASSIFY, SYSTEMATIZE AND REGULATE THE ACTIVITIES OF ONLINE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT CONTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE "COLLABORATIVE ECONOMY" IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY RESPOND TO THEIR OPERATIONAL PRACTICES. TO DEMONSTRATE THIS HYPOTHESIS, THE PRESENT PAPER FIRST PROVIDED A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO HELP IDENTIFY THE ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE A COLLABORATIVE ECONOMY OF THOSE WHO DO NOT; AS A SECOND STEP, IT CHOSE TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY THAT ALLOWED TO SHOW THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PLATFORMS BASED ON THE DEVELOPED ACTIVITY; WHAT ALLOWED THE THIRD STEP, TO ELABORATE A REGULATION PROPOSAL IN MEXICO, AND FINALLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE REFORMS WAS JUSTIFIED FROM THE CURRENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DIMENSION IN THE COUNTRY.
292	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES SOME CHANGES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND SOCIAL PHENOMENA OVER THIRTY YEARS OF TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. THE FINDINGS POINT AT VERY FREQUENT RADICAL CHANGES IN KEY INSTITUTIONS AND THE TENDENCY TO BELIEVE THAT PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED VIA FORMAL LEGISLATIVE APPROACH. MOST OF CROATIA'S MAIN PROBLEMS (POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL) ARISE FROM THE WRONG CHOICE AND PERFORMANCE OF DEMOCRATIC AND MARKET INSTITUTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF INTEGRATIONS. THE ADOPTED LEGISLATION HAS NOT PROVIDED FOR PREDICTABILITY, RELIABILITY, OR SYSTEM STABILITY IN KEY AREAS OF HUMAN INTERACTION. THE FINDINGS INDICATE AN AMBIVALENT ATTITUDE OF THE ACTORS TOWARDS THE STATE, THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER THREE DECADES OF TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION, THE FAILURE OF THE ESTABLISHED MODEL OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IS VISIBLE. IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE MODEL OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, THERE MUST BE AN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE POLITICAL ROLE MODEL AND THE CONSENSUS ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF SOCIETY.
293	CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN DECLINING CONTINUOUSLY AT A RAPID RATE SINCE 2011. IT DROPPED TO 6.7% IN 2016 BY MORE THAN 3% FROM NEARLY 10% AVERAGE GROWTH RATE DURING 1979-2010. AS FOR ITS CAUSES, THERE ARE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS AMONG CHINESE ECONOMISTS. ONE OF THE INTERPRETATIONS, WHICH IS HELD BY SOME SCHOLARS INCLUDING JUSTIN YIFU LIN, IS THAT EXTERNAL AND CYCLICAL FACTORS ARE THE MAIN CAUSES FOR THE DECLINE. THE AUTHOR DISAGREES WITH THIS VIEWPOINT AND HOLDS THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF ECONOMIC DECELERATION IS THE DELAY IN DEEP INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND STATE COERCIVE CAPACITY ARE TWO ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS FOR SUSTAINING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. CHINA MUST FURTHER ENHANCE ECONOMIC INCLUSIVENESS, AND ACCELERATE ITS TRANSITION INTO AN EFFICIENCY-DRIVEN AND INNOVATION-DRIVEN ECONOMY THROUGH DEEPENED COMPREHENSIVE MARKETIZATION REFORMS. MEANWHILE, IT SHOULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW TO BUILD A LIMITED GOVERNMENT THAT IS CAPABLE, ACCOUNTABLE, EFFECTIVE AND CARING.
294	MICRO AND SMALL ENTERPRISES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES RARELY UPGRADE AND GROW. THE REASONS ARE DISPUTED. RECENTLY, THE 'DOING BUSINESS' REPORTS STRONGLY INFLUENCED THE POLICY AGENDA, ATTRIBUTING SMALL ENTERPRISE STAGNATION MAINLY TO EXCESSIVE BUREAUCRACY AND OVER-REGULATION. THEY CLAIM A STRONG CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP RUNNING FROM REGULATORY REFORM AND FORMALISATION TO BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ADVOCATE REFORMS TO REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY AND COST OF REGULATION. OUR FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH IN THE PHILIPPINES, INDIA AND EGYPT CHALLENGE THIS VIEW. BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES ARE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE. ENTREPRENEURS WHO WANT TO FORMALISE ARE USUALLY ABLE TO DO SO. FORMALISATION USUALLY COMES AFTER A FIRM HAS UPGRADED, I.E. WHEN THE ENTREPRENEUR PERCEIVES THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF FORMALISATION OUTWEIGH ITS DISADVANTAGES. SUCCESS IN UPGRADING IS STRONGLY RELATED TO ENTREPRENEURIAL ATTITUDES AND SKILLS: KNOW-HOW, PROACTIVE SEARCH FOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, RISK-TAKING ATTITUDE AND CREATIVITY IN DEALING WITH FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND DEFICITS IN THE RULE OF LAW.
295	THIS RESEARCH PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE INCIDENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF GDP AND CO2 EMISSION. WE USE A STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS FRONTIER MODEL OF A SAMPLE OF TEN COUNTRIES, DURING THE PERIOD 1995-2013. BESIDES, WE EXPLAIN THE CO2 EMISSION AND GDP INEFFICIENCY BY THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH APPEARS IN THE EXAMINATION OF THE INTERRELATIONS WITHIN INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, CO2 EMISSIONS' EFFICIENCY AND GDP EFFICIENCY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTION'S QUALITY IN MAGHREB'S COUNTRIES IS DEFICIENT, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE UPRISING WHICH LEADS TO A HIGH LEVEL OF INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNFAVOURABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, IN THE GULF COUNTRIES, A GOOD INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SUCH AS CORRUPTION REDUCTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND SO ON WOULD PARTICIPATE TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES AND TO CREATE FAVOURABLE INSTITUTIONAL CLIMATE THAT HELPS PURSUING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. REGARDING CO2 EMISSIONS, THE ORIENTATION TOWARDS MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY COULD IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE.
296	THE DOMINANCE OF THE INTERNE AS A SHOPPING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL ALSO NECESSITATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF E-SERVICE QUALITY. USING MEANS-ENDS-CHAIN THEORY, WE DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT MODELS AND THE ASSOCIATED MULTIPLE MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO EXAMINE THIS CONSTRUCT. WE TEST THE MEASURES EMPIRICALLY USING META-ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES. WE ALSO SUMMARIZE THE IMPACT OF E-SERVICE QUALITY ON KEY OUTCOMES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, REPURCHASE INTENTIONS, AND WORD-OF-MOUTH, AS WELL AS THE MODERATING IMPACT OF THREE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS: COUNTRY CULTURE, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, AND INDUSTRY CONTEXT. RESULTS INDICATE THAT E-SERVICE QUALITY HAS FOUR UNDERLYING DIMENSIONS (WEBSITE DESIGN, FULFILMENT, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND SECURITY/PRIVACY) THOUGH THEIR RELEVANCE FOR OVERALL E-SERVICE QUALITY IS MODERATED BY COUNTRY-SPECIFIC (UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE, MASCULINITY, POWER DISTANCE, INDIVIDUALISM), REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC (FINANCIAL SECRECY, RULE OF LAW), AND INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC (SERVICES/GOODS, RETAILING/BANKING) FACTORS AS WELL AS RESEARCH-DESIGN FACTORS.

297	CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT "SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS" FIRST APPEARED IN SUPREME COURT JURISPRUDENCE IN THE DRED SCOTT CASE. SOME SCHOLARS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THAT THE SEEDS, OR EVEN THE FULL GROWTH, OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE APPEARED MUCH EARLIER. WHENEVER IT FIRST APPEARED, CONTROVERSY RAGES OVER WHETHER SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS IS A LEGITIMATE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION'S TWO DUE PROCESS CLAUSES. THE ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT BOTH THE HISTORICAL AND THE INTERPRETIVE CONTROVERSIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY MISPLACED. THERE IS A "SUBSTANTIVE" ELEMENT TO DUE PROCESS, NAMELY, ITS PROTECTION OF NORMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS AGAINST RULE BY DECREE. BUT THIS IS A FAR CRY FROM THE POLICY JUDGMENT ROLE NOW ROUTINELY ASSIGNED TO THE COURTS UNDER THE RUBRIC OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS. THE DRED SCOTT CASE DOES REPRESENT A TURNING POINT IN THE HISTORY OF DUE PROCESS, BUT NOT QUITE THE TURNING POINT IT IS USUALLY THOUGHT TO BE.
298	IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT A POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSE OF SOMALI PIRACY IS THE (ILLEGAL) OVERFISHING THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY'S WATERS, WHICH HAS DEPRIVED LOCAL FISHERS OF THEIR LIVELIHOODS, AND WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS ANOTHER FORM OF 'PIRACY'. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE THE ORIGINS OF THIS ARGUMENT USING BOTH HISTORICAL AND ECOSYSTEM JUSTICE FRAMEWORKS, AND ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF PIRACY IN SOMALIA IS A RESULT OF A COMBINATION OF STATE FAILURE, IUU FISHING, TOXIC WASTE DUMPING AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ECOSYSTEM. WE THEN PRESENT SOME POTENTIAL RESOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF PIRACY, WHICH REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED APPROACH, INCLUDING (I) THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A VIABLE SOMALI STATE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY; AND (II) ACTION TAKEN TO PREVENT ILLEGAL FISHING AND TOXIC WASTE DUMPING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE LOCAL FISHING INDUSTRY.

299	THE COLOMBIAN CONGRESS HAS BEEN ADOPTING DIFFERENT PARAMETERS THAT MODIFIED THE CALCULATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS CONTAINED IN THE LAW, BUT IN A MANNER WHICH IS PARTIAL AND NON CONCLUSIVE, MAKING ROOM FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE FOR ACADEMICS AND GENERATING CASE LAW THAT APPLY THOSE RULES DISREGARDING CONCEPTUAL AMBIGUITY AND IMPROPER LAW DRAFTING TECHNIQUE. THIS PAPER SHOWS THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL PARAMETERS DISTRIBUTED ON MANY LEGAL STATUTES AND THE NEED FOR INTERPRETATION AND INTEGRATION OF THOSE PARAMETERS IN ORDER TO GRANT LEGAL CERTAINTY AND SECURITY FOR THE CALCULATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND TERMS UNDER A DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICULATION OF ALL DISPOSITIONS ON THIS FIELD CLOSES LOOPHOLES ON LEGISLATION ALLOWING CORRECT COMPUTATION OF LEGAL TERMS OF HOURS, DAYS, MONTHS AND YEARS. FINALLY, RULES AND PRINCIPLES FOR THE CALCULATION OF TIME LIMITS AND TERMS ARE ANALYZED IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR LAWYERS AND JUDGES.
300	FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS, BURUNDI HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH POWERSHARING AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL LIBERALISATION, DEMOCRATISATION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THIS CONTRIBUTION ANALYSES THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS THE CONCEPT OF POWER-SHARING HAS HAD THROUGHOUT BURUNDI'S RECENT AND EXTREMELY VIOLENT POLITICAL TRANSITION, IN PARTICULAR DURING THE LENGTHY PEACE PROCESS. IT SHOWS HOW NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ACTORS HAVE FOUND INSPIRATION IN THE TOOLBOX OF CONSOCIATIONALISM TO NEGOTIATE AND DESIGN THE ARUSHA PEACE AND RECONCILIATION AGREEMENT FOR BURUNDI SIGNED IN AUGUST 2000 AND ITS POST-TRANSITION CONSTITUTION. POWER-SHARING HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ACHIEVING THE SHORT-TERM OBJECTIVE OF WAR TERMINATION. IT HAS ALSO DE-ETHNICISED POLITICAL COMPETITION AND REDUCED THE (POTENTIALLY) DESTABILISING EFFECT OF ELECTIONS. MEASURED AGAINST MORE AMBITIOUS STATE-BUILDING OBJECTIVES (DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABLE AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE), POWER-SHARING HAS (SO FAR) NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. SEVERAL FACTORS AND DEVELOPMENTS THREATEN THE "SURVIVAL" OF THE POWER-SHARING MODEL IN BURUNDI.
301	IN A NEW DATASET OF 1.3 MILLION FIRMS FROM OVER 100 COUNTRIES, I ESTABLISH A NUMBER OF REGULARITIES IN CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION. CONCENTRATION OF SALES AND EMPLOYMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN SMALLER COUNTRIES AND IN LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; THESE TWO FACTORS ALONE EXPLAIN ROUGHLY HALF THE CROSS-COUNTRY VARIATION IN CONCENTRATION. NEVERTHELESS, A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS OFFER ADDITIONAL EXPLANATORY POWER FOR CONCENTRATION. CONCENTRATION IS HIGHER IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER ENTRY COSTS FOR NEW FIRMS, IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER ANTITRUST POLICY, IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER RULE OF LAW, AND IN COUNTRIES WITH MORE BURDENSOME REGULATION. WEAK INSTITUTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CONCENTRATION ESPECIALLY IN INDUSTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE NATURALLY HIGH LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND CONCENTRATION ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN NONTRADABLE AND INVESTMENT-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES, SUGGESTING THAT NATURAL BARRIERS TO COMPETITION FACILITATE THE MONOPOLIZATION OF SECTORS ESPECIALLY WHEN INSTITUTIONS ARE WEAK.

302	THE PRESENT PAPER GIVES A BROAD OVERVIEW OF SEVERAL KEY BUILDING STONES OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IN EUROPE. CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE STRONGLY DRIVEN BY EUROPEAN STANDARDS: THE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES OF ART 6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE EU'S ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE. ALTHOUGH THEIR SCOPE OF APPLICATION IS LIMITED, BOTH REQUIRE ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS TO PROVIDE FOR EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND GIVE EFFECTIVENESS TO THE RULE OF LAW. NEVERTHELESS, STATES STILL ENJOY A LARGE DEGREE OF AUTONOMY REGARDING THE ORGANISATION AND PROCEDURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS, ALLOWING FOR A VARIETY OF MODELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS WILL BE DISCUSSED UNDER THE PREMISE THAT THE EXISTING SYSTEMS ARE NEITHER RIGID NOR CLOSED MODELS, BUT THAT EUROPEAN STANDARDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE CAN ALSO BE MET THROUGH COMBINING FEATURES FROM DIFFERENT MODELS, AS LONG AS THE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES OF ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE, TOGETHER WITH ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE AND THE JURISDICTIONS OF OTHER COURTS, FORM A CONSISTENT SYSTEM.
303	THE AUTHORS STUDY THE IMPACT OF RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL BANKS' ENGAGEMENT IN SECURITIES, INSURANCE, AND REAL ESTATE, AS WELL AS A MIX OF BANKING AND COMMERCE. THE MODEL SPECIFIES THE IMPACT AS A FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE (THE RULE OF LAW), WHICH ALLOWS THE AUTHORS TO INVESTIGATE TWO CONFLICTING HYPOTHESIS, I.E., THE RESTRICTION-ENHANCING HYPOTHESIS AND FACILITY-SUPPORTING HYPOTHESIS. THE FORMER EFFECT SUGGESTS THAT GOOD-GOVERNANCE ENHANCES THE HYPOTHESIZED ADVERSE EFFECT OF RESTRICTIONS, AND THE LATTER SUGGESTS THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE MITIGATES THIS ADVERSE EFFECT. THE STUDY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL BANKS' RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN SECURITIES AND INSURANCE, ALONG WITH RESTRICTIONS ON THE MIXING OF BANKING AND COMMERCE, REDUCE BANK PROFITS. HOWEVER, GOOD GOVERNANCE MITIGATES SUCH AN ADVERSE IMPACT, I.E., THE FACILITY-SUPPORTING HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED. RESTRICTIONS ON REAL ESTATE, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEEM TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BANK PROFITS. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO DIFFERENT SPECIFICATIONS.
304	AFTER IDENTIFYING A LACK OF ATTENTION TO ELECTORAL COURTS AND POST-ELECTORAL CONTESTATION OF ELECTIONS, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF COMPARATIVE CROSS-NATIONAL DATA ON ELECTION DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY CONSTRUCTING IDEAL TYPES OF ELECTORAL COURT SUCCESS AND FAILURE WITHIN ONE COUNTRY MEXICO, WHERE PRIMARY RESEARCH HAS PRODUCED NEEDED DATA. IT EXPOSES AUTHORITARIAN INCUMBENT/OPPOSITION BARGAINING OVER RULES OF MEXICO'S DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN THE RESOLUTION OF POST-ELECTORAL CONFLICTS IN MEXICO'S MUNICIPALITIES. IN IDENTIFYING LEGAL VERSUS EXTRA-LEGAL PATHS OF POST-ELECTORAL CONTESTATION, IT CONCEIVES OF A "RULE OF LAW" RATIO-THE RATIO OF EXTRA-LEGAL POST-ELECTORAL CONFLICTS TO LEGAL ELECTORAL COURT CASE FILINGS-TO INDICATE GRADUAL INCREASES IN OPPOSITION PARTY COMPLIANCE WITH ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS. UPON ESTABLISHING THE LAG BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THEM, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THIS GAP IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONDITIONS BEYOND THEIR MERE INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS, AND DEMONSTRATES THAT SUCH COMPLIANCE WITH INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT BE ASSUMED.
305	IN QUEENSLAND, USE OF PREIMPLANTATION GENETIC DIAGNOSIS (PGD) AND PRENATAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING (PND) IS LIMITED TO THE DETECTION OF AND ABSTENTION FROM EMBRYOS OR FOETUSES AFFLICTED WITH "SERIOUS" DISABILITIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A LEGISLATIVE DEFINITION OR WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS AMONG PHYSICIANS REGARDING THOSE DISABLEMENTS WHICH ARE SUFFICIENTLY "SERIOUS", IT BEGS THE QUESTION: IS QUEENSLAND'S CURRENT REGULATION OF PND AND PGD INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE IT LACKS CLARITY, STABILITY, AND CERTAINTY AND THUS ARBITRARILY RESTRICTS REPRODUCTIVE LIBERTIES? THIS ARTICLE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DETECTION OF GENETIC ABNORMALITIES VIA PGD AND PND WILL LEAD TO DIFFERING CLINICAL OUTCOMES PRE- AND POST-IMPLANTATION. WHILE THEIR UTILISATION FOR THE THERAPEUTIC PREVENTION OF "SERIOUS" HARM IS A JUSTIFIABLE INTRUSION ON REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY, THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONS' AND DISABLED COMMUNITY'S CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF DISABILITY ARE MALIGNED. QUEENSLAND'S ADOPTION OF A PERMISSIVE LICENSING REGIME FOR PGD AND THE INTERACTIONAL MODEL OF DISABILITY BY PHYSICIANS ADMINISTERING PND IS CONSIDERED.
306	THE TEXT PRESENTS REFLECTIONS ON THE ROLE AND STATUS OF THE THEORY OF LEGISLATION AND DEFENDS A CERTAIN TYPE OF MORE "REALISTIC" THEORY - THAT INCORPORATES THE PRACTICES OF LEGISLATORS IN FLESH AND BLOOD, THAT IS NOT LIMITED TO ABSTRACT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OR FAR FROM CONCRETE EXAMPLES, THAT ANALYSES INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES -, AS A STARTING POINT TO OFFER USEFUL ADVICE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO IMPROVING LAWS AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION. TO THIS END, TWO ASSUMPTIONS ARE EXPLAINED: THE RULE OF LAW AND LAW AS THE MAIN TOOL FOR SOCIAL CONTROL, WHICH REQUIRE THE RATIONALIZATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER WITH THE PRESENTATION OF REASONS FOR STATUES. NEXT, IT FOCUSES ON THE CORE CONCERNS OF THE THEORY OF LEGISLATION, EXPOSING SOME PROBLEMS COMMON TO THE AUTHORS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO THE SUBJECT. AFTER THAT, THE TWO CENTRAL ARGUMENTS ARE DEVELOPED, HIGHLIGHTING THE IDEA THAT THE POST-POSITIVIST CONCEPTION OF LAW IS A CONDITION FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORE "REALISTIC" THEORY OF LEGISLATION.
307	HIGHER TAX ENFORCEMENT IS CONSISTENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER INFORMALITY IN THE LITERATURE, WHEREAS THE EVIDENCE IS MIXED FOR OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING INFORMALITY. WE REVIEW THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECT OF TAX ENFORCEMENT ON INFORMALITY AND PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE IN THE FORM OF SUBSAMPLE TESTS OF THE EFFECT OF TAX ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFIED IN LIU-EVANS AND MITRA (ECON LETT 182:122-125, 2019). WE FIND RULE OF LAW, THE MOST COMMONLY USED PROXY FOR TAX ENFORCEMENT, HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND ROBUST NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INFORMALITY ACCORDING TO THE CONTINUOUS TREATMENT TEST DUE TO BELLONI ET AL. (REV ECON STUD 81:608-650, 2014). USING A STYLIZED GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, WITH CREDIT CONSTRAINED FORMAL AND INFORMAL FIRMS, WE CONDUCT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS TO STUDY THE ENFORCEMENT-WELFARE RELATIONSHIP FOR VARYING LEVELS OF ENFORCEMENT COSTS. WE SHOW THAT TAX-ENFORCEMENT IS ONLY DESIRABLE AS A POLICY TOOL FOR REDUCING INFORMALITY WHEN, CONTRARY TO EVIDENCE FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IN THE LITERATURE, ENFORCEMENT COSTS ARE VERY LOW (ALMOST ZERO).
308	THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IMPORTANT FORMAL CHANGES TO THE UNITED KINGDOM'S CONSTITUTION OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, INCLUDING DEVOLUTION TO NORTHERN IRELAND, SCOTLAND, AND WALES; THE INCORPORATION OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN DOMESTIC LAW; AND THE CREATION OF A NEW SUPREME COURT. THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE INFORMAL SEMANTIC CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE ACCOMPANIED THESE FORMAL CHANGES. IT FOCUSES ON SEVERAL CENTRAL CONCEPTS: PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, DEVOLUTION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. USING A RECENTLY DEVELOPED MACHINE LEARNING METHOD TO ANALYSE A MASSIVE CORPUS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE, THE ARTICLE GAUGES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CONCEPTS HAVE BECOME MORE (OR LESS) RELATED TO THE MEANING OF THE UK'S CONSTITUTION IN PARLIAMENTARY DISCOURSE. ULTIMATELY, THE ANALYSIS SUPPORTS SOME IMPORTANT THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE CLAIM THAT PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IS NOW A LESS SIGNIFICANT CONCEPT FOR THE MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTION THAN IT ONCE WAS.
309	THE MOBILIZATION OF LAW TO ADDRESS THE DEGRADATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IMPLICATES A WIDE RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS, ACTORS, AND MATERIALS. THIS ARTICLE MAPS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL MOBILIZATION. IT EXAMINES THE DIFFERENT THEORETICAL APPROACHES THAT ACCOUNT FOR WHY AND HOW GROUPS MOBILIZE THE LAW (OR DO NOT), INCLUDING EXPLANATIONS FOCUSING ON LAW; LEGAL OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURES; RESOURCES; AND/OR IDEAS, IDENTITIES, AND KNOWLEDGE. IT THEN CONSIDERS SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF STUDYING ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL MOBILIZATION AND HIGHLIGHTS RECENT EFFORTS TO OVERCOME THEM AND BROADEN THE SCOPE OF THE ANALYSIS. THE ARTICLE THEN IDENTIFIES FOUR TRENDS THAT ARE SHAPING THE MOBILIZATION OF LAW: (A) CHANGING FORMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND REGULATION; (B) SHIFTS IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING REPRESSION OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE UNDERMINING OF THE RULE OF LAW; (C) THE GROWING DIVERSITY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT; AND (D) THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE DEGRADATION ON THE VERY INSTITUTIONS, PROCESSES, AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE MOBILIZATION OF LAW.
310	BACKGROUND: TRADITIONAL MEDICINE (HERBAL MEDICINE, STANDARDIZED HERBAL MEDICINE, PHYTOPHARMACA (CLINICAL-BASED HERBAL MEDICINE), IMPORTED TRADITIONAL MEDICINE) IS AN INGREDIENT OR HERB INGREDIENTS IN THE FORM OF PLANT INGREDIENTS, ANIMAL INGREDIENTS, MINERAL INGREDIENTS, GALENIC PREPARATIONS, OR A MIXTURE OF SUCH INGREDIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR TREATMENT FOR GENERATIONS, AND CAN BE APPLIED BY THE NORMS PREVAILING IN THE SOCIETY. AIM: TO FIND OUT AND ANALYZE RELATED TO THE SUPERVISION AND REGISTRATION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE BRANDS IN INDONESIA. METHODOLOGY: THIS RESEARCH USES A QUALITATIVE METHOD WITH A NORMATIVE JURIDICAL APPROACH. DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES ARE CARRIED OUT THROUGH LIBRARY STUDIES. CONCLUSION: SUPERVISION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE BRANDS' REGISTRATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT TO THE MAXIMUM BY THE NATIONAL AGENCY OF DRUG AND FOOD CONTROL (NADFC). THIS AVOIDS THE PROBLEMS THAT WILL ARISE IN THE EVENT OF THE OBSCURITY OF THE SURVEILLANCE PROCESS. GOOD AND PROPER SUPERVISION MUST BE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE INDONESIA RECOGNIZES THE LAW'S EXISTENCE.
311	WHEN REBEL GROUPS WITH STATE-BUILDING AMBITIONS CAPTURE TERRITORY, WHO STAYS AND WHY? THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND AN ORIGINAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY IN THE IRAQI CITY OF MOSUL, WHICH WAS CONTROLLED BY THE ISLAMIC STATE FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS, I CONDUCT A MULTI-METHOD DESCRIPTIVE COMPARISON OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF "STAYERS" AGAINST "LEAVERS." I TEST AND FIND SOME QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SUPPORT FOR A THEORY OF COMPETITIVE GOVERNANCE: CIVILIANS WHO PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE UNDER IS RULE-RELATIVE TO THE IRAQI STATE-WERE MORE LIKELY TO STAY UNDER IS RULE THAN THOSE WHO PERCEIVED NO CHANGE OR A DETERIORATION, BUT DISPLACEMENT DECISIONS ARE MULTI-CAUSAL, INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC RESOURCES, SOCIAL NETWORKS AND FAMILY STRUCTURES, INFORMATION, THREAT PERCEPTIONS, AND IDEOLOGY. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW AND BAD GOVERNANCE BY STATES MAY AFFECT THE ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS OF CIVILIANS LIVING UNDER REBEL GOVERNANCE.
312	THINKING THROUGH JAKARTA, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF DECENTRING UNDERSTANDINGS OF CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY FOR ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION ACROSS THE POST-COLONY BY SHIFTING THE OPTIC AWAY FROM EUROPEAN-STYLE CAPITALISM. COLONIALISM, RACISM AND SLAVERY ENABLED THE HEGEMONY OF EUROPEAN-STYLE CAPITALISM, CHARACTERIZED BY NATION-STATES AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE BULK OF THE THEORIZING WITHIN GEOGRAPHICAL POLITICAL ECONOMY ELIDES ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE IT VIEWS THE WORLD FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE. CONCEPTUALIZING CAPITALISM'S RAGGEDY FRINGES (INFORMALITY, STATE ACTIONS AND THE MORE-THAN-HUMAN WORLD) AS MORE-THAN-CAPITALIST PRACTICES WITH THE CAPACITY TO UNRAVEL CAPITALIST NORMS, POSITIONAL CONJUNCTURAL ANALYSIS CAN PROVIDE THE METHODOLOGICAL SPACE TO THINK BEYOND THE NORTH ATLANTIC, CREATING SPACE FOR ENVISIONING ALTERNATIVES. OPERATIONALIZING THESE CLAIMS, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT INDONESIA'S POLITICAL ECONOMY EXCEEDS VARIEGATED EUROPEAN-STYLE CAPITALISM, AND THAT URBAN LAND TRANSFORMATIONS WITHIN JAKARTA ARE DEEPLY SHAPED BY ITS RAGGEDY FRINGES OF ELITE AND GRASSROOTS INFORMALITY AND MORE-THAN-HUMAN HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES OF FLOODING AND WATER MANAGEMENT.
313	"THE CANDLELIGHT PROTEST" OF 2016-2017 IN SOUTH KOREA CULMINATED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S RULING ON THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT PARK GEUN-HYE. THE COURT RELIED HEAVILY ON THE "BALANCING OF INTERESTS" TEST AS THE STANDARD OF JUDGMENT. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO REVEAL, FIRST, THE POVERTY OF LEGAL REASONING IN THE IMPEACHMENT CASE, AS WELL AS IN THE COURT'S RULINGS IN SOME OTHER RECENT CASES. SECOND, IT ARGUES THAT THE FATAL WEAKNESS OF THE "BALANCING" TEST DERIVES FROM THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE TEST ITSELF. IT SUGGESTS THAT IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN MOST CASES TO EXPECT AN OBJECTIVE AND FAIR MEASUREMENT IN THE COMPARISON OF RELEVANT LEGAL INTERESTS, WHERE QUANTIFICATION OF INTERESTS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. GIVEN THE INCOMMENSURABILITY OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS, IT SEEMS UNREALISTIC THAT JURISTS CAN FIND THE RIGHT ANSWERS IN HARD CASES. THE ARTICLE, NEVERTHELESS, PROPOSES THAT ALL LAWYERS SHOULD HAVE A "BELIEF IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIGHT ANSWER" IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW.
314	MEXICO INTRODUCED ITS FIRST UNIPERSONAL LIMITED LIABILITY ENTITY IN 2016, THE SOCIEDAD POR ACCIONES SIMPLIFICADA ("SAS").(1 )THE INTRODUCTION OF MEXICO'S SAS IS IN LINE WITH LEGAL DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA AS A WHOLE, WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT TREND TOWARDS INTRODUCING NEW UNIPERSONAL LIMITED LIABILITY ENTITIES THAT ARE SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR BURGEONING BUSINESS OWNERS AND EASE THE REQUIREMENTS OF OWNING A BUSINESS ENTITY. HOWEVER, THE MEXICAN SAS AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS IS UNIQUELY OVERLY RESTRICTIVE. TO REMEDY THIS, SOME OF THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE ENTITY SHOULD BE LIFTED TO FACILITATE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ENTITY. PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED FOR FURTHER REFORM ARE THE FIVE-MILLION-PESO TOTAL ANNUAL INCOME CAP, BAR ON SAS ENTITIES HAVING JURIDICAL PERSON SHAREHOLDERS, AND BAR ON SAS ENTITIES HAVING SHAREHOLDERS WHO ARE CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS IN ANOTHER MEXICAN ENTITY. THE EXCESSIVE RESTRICTIVENESS OF THE MEXICAN SAS ENTITY IS ILLUSTRATED FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES: LEGISLATIVE INTENT, RULE OF LAW, AND COMPARATIVE LAW.
315	THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL ISSUE FACING THE LEGAL WORLD IN JAPAN IS THE DRIVE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION LED BY PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE AND HIS LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY ( LDP). THIS PAPER SITUATES THE REVISIONIST MOVEMENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF POSTWAR JAPANESE POLITICS BEFORE DRAWING ON THEORETICAL LITERATURE IN CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES TO ANALYZE THE LDP'S DRAFT CONSTITUION TO REVEAL THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES AND TO ASSESS THE RISK THEY POSE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN JAPAN. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSED DRAFT CONSTITUTION ESCHEWS THE LANGUAGES OF THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION LIKE "A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF MANKIND", "INDIVIDUAL", OR "FRUITS OF THE AGE-OLD STRUGGLE OF MAN TO BE FREE", AND FORGOES THE BASIC LEGAL RATIONALITY IN FAVOR OF A MYTHICAL NARRATIVE OF NATIONAL ESSENCE, THEREBY REDUCING LAW TO THE REALM OF POLITICS AND INHIBITING THE ABILITY OF THE FORMER TO SERVE AS A CHECK AGAINST THE LATTER.
316	UKRAINE HAS PURSUED AN AGGRESSIVE "SHOCK THERAPY" APPROACH TO POLICE REFORM SINCE EARLY 2015, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FEBRUARY 2014 MAIDAN PROTESTS AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT. THIS APPROACH IS DESCRIBED AND EXAMINED IN LIGHT OF PREVIOUS 21ST CENTURY POST-SOVIET POLICE REFORM EFFORTS IN UKRAINE, GEORGIA, AND KYRGYZSTAN. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PRESSURES TO DEMONSTRATE REAL COMMITMENT TO CORRUPTION CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW SEEM TO HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR PUSHING UKRAINE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GEORGIAN SHOCK THERAPY MODEL. EARLY RESULTS ARE VERY PROMISING, BUT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES REMAIN, INCLUDING SUSTAINING THE REFORM POLITICAL COALITION, OVERCOMING BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE TO CHANGE, SURVIVING THE ARMED INSURGENCY IN EASTERN UKRAINE, DOWNSIZING THE OLD MILITSIYA, RESHAPING THE CULTURE OF CORRUPTION THAT PERMEATES THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT AND MUCH OF SOCIETY, AND CONVINCING THE CITIZENRY THAT THE NEW POLICE ARE TRULY COMMITTED TO SERVING THE PUBLIC, NOT REGIME PROTECTION.

317	OVER THE PAST DECADES, THE MUCH-DEBATED PUNITIVE TURN' HAS SUBSTANTIALLY TRANSFORMED THE FIELD OF CRIME POLICY. HOWEVER, A SIMULTANEOUS PREVENTATIVE TURN' HAS CHANGED THE ROLE OF THE STATE AT LEAST AS FUNDAMENTALLY. A CASE STUDY OF DUTCH CRIME POLICY SHOWS HOW PREVENTION BOTH COMPLEMENTS AND CONTRADICTS THE CLASSIC JUDICIAL APPROACH UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. NOT THE JUDGE AND JUDICIAL APPARATUS, BUT THE EXECUTIVE POWER IS PIVOTAL IN THE APPROACH TO CRIME. NOT THE LEGAL ORDER, BUT THE PUBLIC ORDER IS THE CENTRAL CONCERN. AND NOT THE DELINQUENT, BUT SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND ESPECIALLY THE POTENTIAL DELINQUENT ARE THE OBJECTS OF INTERVENTION. PREVENTION MAY BE A LOGICAL ANSWER TO THE CRIME AND SECURITY ISSUES OF LATE-MODERN SOCIETIES, BUT IT ALSO COMES AT A PRICE. WE ARE DEVELOPING TOWARDS A GUIDED SOCIETY', IN WHICH CITIZENS HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR AS LONG AS THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE - THAT IS, AS LONG AS THEY DO NOT POSE AN INCREASED RISK.
318	FROM HUGO CHAVEZ IN VENEZUELA TO GEERT WILDERS IN THE NETHERLANDS AND SARAH PALIN IN THE US, POPULIST LEADERS CLAIM TO OFFER MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE'. HOWEVER, MOST SCHOLARS ARGUE THAT POPULISM IS IN FACT A DEMOCRATIC PATHOLOGY, BECAUSE IT SEEKS TO BUILD A POLITICAL SYSTEM DEVOID OF THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT POPULISM MAINTAINS AN AMBIVALENT RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY POPULIST FORCES. DRAWING ON THE WORK OF ROBERT DAHL, I ARGUE THAT CURRENT MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULISM ARE OFFERING SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO TWO DILEMMAS THAT DO NOT HAVE A CLEAR DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION: THE BOUNDARY PROBLEM (HOW TO DEFINE THE PEOPLE?) AND THE LIMITS OF SELF-GOVERNMENT (HOW TO CONTROL THE CONTROLLERS?). MY ARTICLE SHOWS THAT POPULIST FORCES ARE POSING LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS, ALTHOUGH THEIR SOLUTIONS TEND TO BE MORE CONTROVERSIAL THAN HELPFUL.
319	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S (NSA) COUPLING WITH MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES FOR MASS SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS' COMMUNICATIONS AS A FORM OF STATE-FACILITATED STATE-CORPORATE CRIME. IT ADDRESSES THE WAYS THAT THE US SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMMES ARE VIOLATING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND ARE EXCESSIVELY SECRETIVE, IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS. FURTHERMORE, GIVEN THAT ATTACKING AND DEFAMING WHISTLE-BLOWERS IS A HALLMARK OF STATE-CORPORATE CRIME, THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES THE TREATMENT OF EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE CONTRACTOR WHO LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT THE NSA'S PROGRAMMES TO NEWS MEDIA. THE ARTICLE ALSO ADDRESSES HOW THIS WIDESPREAD AND SUSPICIONLESS SPYING IS ANTITHETICAL TO DEMOCRACY, UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND DISSUADING CRITICAL DIALOGUE ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY. WE CONCLUDE WITH AN EXAMINATION OF WHY SO MANY AMERICANS ARE APATHETIC ABOUT THESE PRIVACY VIOLATIONS, FOCUSING ON THE CONSUMERIST IDEOLOGY THAT PROMOTES WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE OF EFFORTS THAT ALLEGEDLY RESULT IN GREATER NATIONAL SECURITY.
320	ALTHOUGH THE STATE IN CHINA IS NO LONGER ALL ENCOMPASSING AS IT HAD BEEN DURING THE PRE-1979 CENTRALLY PLANNED PERIOD, IT STILL REACHES INTO NUMEROUS AREAS OF THE ECONOMY, NOTABLY THROUGH ITS CONTINUING OWNERSHIP OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES. AS A RESULT, CHINA POSES A PARADOX IN THAT IT HAS INCOMPLETE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW WHICH ARE THOUGHT TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH. THERE ARE, THOUGH, NUMEROUS INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A GRADUAL TRANSITION WHICH MAY HAVE MAINTAINED A STABLE GROWTH RATE IN THE PAST, BUT COULD HAMPER FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AS A KEY EXAMPLE, STATE-OWNED FIRMS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM FINANCIAL REPRESSION IN WHICH THEY RECEIVED PREFERABLE ALLOCATIONS OF CREDIT. THUS, CHINA'S HIGH SAVINGS RATE FUELS INVESTMENT WHICH HAS DRIVEN GROWTH, BUT IS INCREASINGLY INEFFICIENT AS CREDIT IS FUNNELLED TO THE LESS PRODUCTIVE SOES. THIS INEFFICIENCY POINTS TO THE NEED FOR LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS WHICH MAY CONFLICT WITH THE STILL BROAD BUT OPAQUE BORDERS OF THE CHINESE STATE.
321	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM TERRORISM IN RELATION TO COUNTER-TERRORIST LEGISLATION ACROSS THE WORLD BY EXAMINING MAJOR DEVELOPM ENTS IN THE JURISPRUDENCE, INCLUDING EXAMPLES FROM, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, SOUTH AFRICA, INDIA, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THROUGH THESE CASES, THE PATH FROM DEPORTATION TO DETENTION, TOTORTURE, CONTROL ORDERS AND FINALLY, SPECIAL TRIAL PROCEDURES IS EXAMINED. THE ARTICLE CONSIDER SHOW THE LAW MUST ADAPT TO THE NEW CHALLENGES IT NOW FACES; HOW COURTS, WHILE BEING THE GUARDIANS OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, HAVE TO ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE TERRORIST THREAT. THE ARTICLE THEN DRAWS SOME CONCLUSIONS REGARDING LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE, QUESTIONING WHETHER THE INCOMPLETE SECURITY WHICH COUNTER-TERRORIST MEASURES PROVIDE, JUSTIFIES THEIR EFFECT ON THE LIBERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE NEED TO HOLD ON TO THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF A PLURAL, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW, IN ORDER TO DEFEAT TERRORISM.
322	THE STUDY FOCUSES ON EVALUATION OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND ITS POSSIBLE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS. THE TEXT STEMS FROM THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS, ESPECIALLY HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONALISM, AND IT BASES ON THE CONCEPT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE SOURCE OF THE EVALUATION IS THE SCHEME OF THE WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE MATTERS, SUPPLEMENTED WITH RESEARCH OF OTHER INSTITUTIONS WORKING WITH INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. AUTHORS EVALUATE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS - VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, WHICH TOGETHER FORM AGGREGATE INDICATOR OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. OLD MEMBER COUNTRIES OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU-15) ARE CLASSIFIED INTO DIFFERENT MODELS OF CAPITALISM ACCORDING TO THEIR. DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN NEW MEMBER COUNTRIES (EU-10, EVENTUALLY EU-8) IN PERIOD 1996-2004 ILLUSTRATE BOTH INSTITUTIONAL ADJUSTMENT OF POSTCOMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND DYNAMICS OF THESE CHANGES AND THEIR CONVERGENCE TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAPITALISM.
323	IN THIS ARTICLE, I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FOUR FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVES ABOUT THE EU AND OUTLINE HOW THEY CONTINUE TO SHAPE EU POLITICS OF THE PRESENT DAY. THE FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVES ARE (1) THE EU AS A PEACE PROJECT, (2) THE NOTION THAT THE EU IS FORGED IN CRISIS, (3) THE SENSE THAT DEEPER ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE FOSTERS POLITICAL CHANGE AND (4) THE IDEA THAT LAW CAN REPLACE POWER POLITICS IN THE EU. IN ORDER FOR THE EUROPEAN PROJECT TO ADDRESS CURRENT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, POLITICAL POLARIZATION OR THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS, I ARGUE THAT EUROPEANS NEED TO CONFRONT THEIR PAST. HISTORY IS NOT ONLY THE RECOLLECTION OF EVENTS; IT REPRESENTS THE CONNECTIONS THAT THE PUBLIC AND ELITES WISH TO MAKE. SO, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP POLICY SOLUTIONS TO CROSS-BORDER ISSUES, EUROPEAN CONTEMPORARIES NEED TO CRITICALLY REVISIT PAST CONNECTIONS AND TO UNCOVER BLIND SPOTS. IF EUROPEANS REVISIT THE EU'S FOUNDATIONAL NARRATIVES, THEY MIGHT ALSO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHOULD CHANGE IN THE EU TODAY.
324	THIS PAPER RESPONDS TO HOLLY BREWER'S ARTICLE "CREATING A COMMON LAW OF SLAVERY FOR ENGLAND AND ITS NEW WORLD EMPIRE." BREWER TRACES A PROCESS BEGUN BY CHARLES I, IN COLLABORATION WITH HIS APPOINTED JUDGES, TO LEGALIZE THE BUYING AND SELLING OF PEOPLE IN ENGLAND AND ITS EMPIRE. BREWER'S WORK IS A MUCH-NEEDED RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEGAL PRECEDENTS THAT TRANSFORMED PEOPLE INTO CHATTEL, ENABLING THE BUSINESS OF SLAVERY IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES. YET RACE DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY ENGAGEMENT AS A CATEGORY OF ANALYSIS. MISSING IS AN ACCOUNT OF THE HISTORICAL PROCESSES WHEREBY LAWS ABOUT SLAVERY CONTRIBUTED TO RACIAL FORMATION. ALTHOUGH THE GLOBAL EXPANSION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE COINCIDED WITH A NEW EMPHASIS ON RULE OF LAW AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, BOUND LABOR AND PERSISTENT QUESTIONS OF RACE, GENDER, STATUS, AGE, NATION, AND BOUNDARY CALLED ATTENTION TO THE CONTRADICTIONS EMBODIED IN ENLIGHTENMENT THOUGHT AND ITS PROCLAIMED UNIVERSAL VALUES.
325	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW PARTICIPATORY ART CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LEGAL CHANGE. AS A CASE STUDY, IT DISCUSSES JONAS STAAL'S PROJECT OF NEW WORLD SUMMIT IN ROJAVA, A (SO FAR STILL) AUTONOMOUS REGION IN NORTH AND EAST SYRIA. IT OFFERS AN INTERESTING CASE, SINCE IT INVITES THE LAW TO INCLUDE WHAT IT HAS EXCLUDED SO FAR. TO BEGIN WITH, IT IS CLARIFIED HOW CHANGE IS CONCEIVED WITHIN LEGAL SYSTEMS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH LAW RESISTS RADICAL CHANGE, IT IS INVOLVED IN A CONSTANT PROCESS OF ADAPTATION TO ITS ENVIRONMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, STAAL'S PROJECT OF NEW WORLD SUMMIT IS DISCUSSED FROM A UTOPIAN PERSPECTIVE. ITS APPARENT IMPOSSIBILITY IS WHAT MAKES IT SO VALUABLE FOR LAW AND ITS DEVELOPMENT. BY ERECTING A PARLIAMENT FOR ROJAVA, IT PRESENTS A PICTURE OF HOW THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER COULD LOOK LIKE WHEN THINGS WERE DIFFERENT. AS SUCH, IT IS AN EXERCISE IN "UTOPIAN WORLD-MAKING".
326	EMERGENCIES ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE. LAWS THAT RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES CAN CREATE EXCEPTIONS TO RULES THAT PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS. IN LONG LASTING EMERGENCIES, THESE EXCEPTIONS CAN BECOME THE RULE, DILUTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERODING THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROMPTED STATES TO CHANGE RULES GOVERNING COMMERCIAL AND PERSONAL ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS. MANY GOVERNORS' EXECUTIVE ORDERS WERE CHALLENGED AS VIOLATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS OF THOSE AFFECTED. JUDGES ARE DECIDING WHETHER EMERGENCIES CAN JUSTIFY MORE RESTRICTIONS THAN WOULD BE PERMITTED IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHETHER SOME RIGHTS DESERVE MORE PROTECTION THAN OTHERS, EVEN IN AN EMERGENCY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES ONGOING LITIGATION INVOLVING EMERGENCY RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. THESE CASES SUGGEST THAT SOME JUDGES ARE ALTERING THE STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE STATE'S EMERGENCY POWERS IN WAYS THAT COULD PERMANENTLY STRENGTHEN SOME RIGHTS AND DILUTE OTHERS IN NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES.
327	THE RECENT UPSURGE OF POPULISM HAS PROMPTED A WAVE OF THEORETICAL REFLECTIONS ON CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. ECHOING MAX WEBER'S SOCIOLOGY OF LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY, BRUCE ACKERMAN'S REVOLUTIONARY CONSTITUTIONS: CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP AND THE RULE OF LAW STANDS OUT FROM THE CROWD BY PROVIDING AN AMBITIOUS TRICHOTOMY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY-REVOLUTIONARY, ESTABLISHMENTARIAN AND ELITIST-WITH A FOCUS ON THE REVOLUTIONARY PATHWAY. ENGAGING WITH ACKERMAN'S THEORETICAL MODELLING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY, I ARGUE THAT THE RESURGENCE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, AS EMBODIED IN WE THE PEOPLE IN POPULIST RHETORIC INDICATES THE CENTRALITY OF AUTHENTICITY IN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHENTICITY IS UNDERPINNED BY THE ETHICS OF BEING TRUE TO THE PEOPLE'S ORIGINALITY. YET, WITH THE ETHICS OF AUTHENTICITY ASSUMING ITS PATHOLOGICAL FORM, THE FOCUS HAS BEEN SHIFTING FROM MAKING SENSE OF THE CONSTITUTION TO THE PEOPLE'S SELF-IDENTIFICATION WITH INDIVIDUAL POLITICIANS. THE LATEST WAVE OF POPULISM CRYSTALLISES THE ANTI-ETHICS OF AUTHENTICITY IN OUR QUEST FOR LASTING CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY.
328	AT THE MOMENT, THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE SYSTEM OF RESPONDING TO CRISES IN THE HEALTH SECTOR LIE IN THE IMPERFECTION OF THE RESPONSE ORDER AND MANAGEMENT MECHANISMS THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE LEGAL REGULATION AND REFLECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES IN CHINA, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE CASE OF 2019 CORONAVIRUS. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGULATION OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN CHINA FOR THE PERIOD FROM THE END OF 2019. THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTING AND CONTROLLING THE EPIDEMIC IS SUBSTANTIATED, AND SHORTCOMINGS IN THE WORK TO COMBAT THE EPIDEMIC ARE ANALYSED. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO ISSUES OF INFORMING THE PUBLIC AND THE RULE OF LAW IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THE PROVISIONS OF THE LEGISLATION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES WERE ALSO EXAMINED. THE PAPER IS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY FOR CHINA, BUT FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD IN THE PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CORONAVIRUS.
329	LAW AND LAWYERS TEND TO BE SEEN AS EITHER PREFERENTIAL VICTIMS OF OR KEY COUNTERFORCES TO RISING ILLIBERALISM. BRAZIL OFFERS A GOOD TESTBED FOR THESE CLAIMS. BRAZILIAN DEMOCRACY HAS DETERIORATED CONSIDERABLY, AS EPITOMIZED BY THE ELECTION OF JAIR BOLSONARO IN 2018. YET, SINCE 2014, LAW AND LAWYERS HAVE BECOME EVER MORE CENTRAL TO BRAZIL'S FIELD OF STATE POWER. AS THE ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVE CAR WASH (LAVA JATO) GAINED MOMENTUM, BRAZILIAN JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS WERE CELEBRATED, LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY, AS CHAMPIONS OF TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND 'THE RULE OF LAW'. FOLLOWING A CLOSER LOOK AT CAR WASH, THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS SUCH IDEALIZATION OF LAW AND LAWYERS. DRAWING ON RESEARCH ON PRESS INTERVIEWS AND STATEMENTS BY CAR WASH LEGAL OFFICERS, I FIND THAT, THROUGHOUT THE CASE, THEY PRODUCED A 'POLITICAL GRAMMAR' THAT IS CLOSER TO ILLIBERALISM THAN MANY WOULD PREDICT. BASED ON RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SOCIOLOGY OF FIELDS, I ARGUE THAT THE PRODUCTION OF THESE GRAMMARS YIELDS SOCIETAL EFFECTS THAT DESERVE SCHOLARLY AND CIVIC ATTENTION.
330	RENEWABLE ENERGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION ARE HIGH ON THE INTERNATIONAL AGENDA, AS IS THE PROSPECT OF EXPANDING ACTIVITY NORTHWARDS TO ARCTIC WATERS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE REVIEW CORE ELEMENTS OF THE MARINE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS FOR AQUACULTURE FACILITIES AND OFFSHORE WIND FARMS IN NORWAY AND SCOTLAND. MANAGEMENT OF THESE SECTORS THROUGH STRATEGIC PLANNING, MARINE SPATIAL PLANNING AND LICENSING SYSTEMS FURTHERS RULE OF LAW VALUES SUCH AS STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY, MAKING INVESTMENT LESS RISKY. THE REVIEW ILLUSTRATES HOW THE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS ALSO FACILITATE FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY, BALANCING PREDICTABILITY CONSIDERATIONS AGAINST THE NEED TO ADAPT MANAGEMENT TO NATURAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, OR EVEN EFFECTIVE MULTI-USE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHAT ENDEAVOURS HAVE BEEN MADE TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PREDICTABILITY AND ADAPTABILITY IN THESE SECTORS IN NORWAY AND SCOTLAND. THIS STUDY OF MARINE MANAGEMENT REGIMES IN THE ARCTIC AND NORTHERN PARTS OF THE TEMPERATE NORTHERN ATLANTIC, AND THE VALUES UNDERPINNING THESE REGIMES, PROVIDES LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE ARCTIC.
331	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO RETRACE THE DAHRENDORF 'S ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INEQUALITY, LIFE CHANCES AND SOCIAL POLICY. DAHRENDORF 'S WAY OF CONCEIVING SOCIAL POLICY, FUNCTIONAL TO THE EXPANSION OF LIFE CHANCES, CONSTITUTES, IN FACT, AN ORIGINAL APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY IN TERMS NOT ONLY OF ANALYTICS BUT ALSO OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE. HE CONSIDERS THE PROBLEM OF INEQUALITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY A MATTER OF ENTITLEMENTS, NOT MERELY OF AVAILABLE WEALTH. TO PROPOSE THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE DAHRENDORF 'S THEORY, WE FOCUS ON THE MINIMUM BASIC INCOME AND THE ISSUE OF CIVIL RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP ON A TRANSNATIONAL/GLOBAL SCALE. THE CONCLUSIONS DISCUSS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE EXPANSION OF LIFE CHANCES REQUIRES A NEW SOCIAL POLICY BASED ON A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE, THE REFERENCE TO VALUES OF SOLIDARITY, LINKED TO THE ETHICS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, AND REQUIRES A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ANCHORED IN THE RULE OF LAW.
332	THE OLD QUESTION OF THE POSSIBLE EMPOWERMENT OF LAW OR THE JUSTIFICATION OF POWER - WHICH BLAISE PASCAL PARTICULARLY URGED - IS ANSWERED IN (POST-HEGEL) GERMAN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE DOCTRINE OF THE STATE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE SENSE OF A PUBLIC AUTHORITY AND STATE POWER BASED LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. RUDOLPH VON JHERING, MAX WEBER, CARL SCHMITT AND THEODOR LITT REPRESENT THIS APPROACH UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE 20TH CENTURY. UP TO THE PRESENT, THERE IS A CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF THE, INTROVERTED" THINKING OF THE, RECHTSSTAAT", THE RULE OF LAW (BY ERNST-WOLFGANG BOCKENFORDE), EVEN OBLIVION OF THE STATE (,,STAATSVERGESSENHEIT" AND, STAATSVERDRANGUNG" - BY JOSEF ISENSEE). THIS THE LAW DEVASTING THINKING OF, POWER" TAKES AN INTOLERABLE PHILOSOPHICAL EXACERBATION IN THE THESES OF GIORGIO AGAMBEN ON, BIOPOLITICS" AND THE ,,CAMP" AS THE NOMOS OF MODERNISM. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ANTITHESES HAS NOT YET FOUND THE NECESSARY ATTENTION IN THE GERMAN DOCTRINE - THE VOICE OF HANNAH ARENDT.
333	THIS IS THE SECOND ARTICLE IN A TWO-PART SERIES THAT ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING LAW AS IT AFFECTS THE RIGHTS TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. THIS ARTICLE USES THE RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST ARTICLE TO ESTABLISH A METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH LAW CAN BE MADE OR INTERPRETED IN THIS AREA. THE METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS THE ADJUDICATION OF COMMON LAW RIGHTS BY COURTS, JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF STATUTE AND THE MAKING OF LAWS. KEY AREAS OF LAW CONSIDERED ARE THOSE THAT PERMIT THE DETENTION AND USE OF RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES FOR CHALLENGING BEHAVIOURS' OR BEHAVIOURS OF CONCERN'. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT A RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH AND A METHOD TO ASSESS HOW LAW APPLIES IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT A THICK' RULE OF LAW CAN PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS.
334	THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS BECOME THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. AT THE CENTER OF THE CONTROVERSY LIES THE MECHANISM OF INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS), WHICH ALLOWS PRIVATE FIRMS LEGAL RECOURSE AGAINST GOVERNMENTS IF GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE HAS DEGRADED THEIR INVESTMENT. USING NEWLY RELEASED DATA COVERING 742 INVESTMENT DISPUTES, I ASSESS SOME OF THE CENTRAL CLAIMS ABOUT ISDS. I ARGUE THAT THE REGIME HAS INDEED UNDERGONE AN IMPORTANT SHIFT: A MAJORITY OF CLAIMS TODAY DEAL NOT WITH DIRECT TAKINGS BY LOW-RULE-OF-LAW COUNTRIES, BUT WITH REGULATION IN DEMOCRATIC STATES. SUCH INDIRECT EXPROPRIATION CLAIMS HAVE SEEN A PRECIPITOUS DECREASE IN THEIR ODDS OF LEGAL SUCCESS OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. THEY ARE ALSO FAR LESS LIKELY TO RESULT IN EARLY SETTLEMENT. THESE PARALLEL TRENDS MAY BE A RESULT OF A RISE IN STRATEGIC LITIGATION BY INVESTORS WHOSE AIM IS NOT ONLY TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION BUT ALSO TO DETER GOVERNMENTS' REGULATORY AMBITIONS.
335	STRONG INSTITUTIONS AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENTS ARE IMPERATIVE FOR ANY COUNTRY'S LONG-TERM PROSPERITY. YET THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS HAS PRESENTED A CONTINUOUS CHALLENGE FOR MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. USING RUSSIA AS A CASE, THIS STUDY BRINGS ATTENTION TO THE UNEXPECTED NEGATIVE IMPACT OF GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCE AND SHOWS THAT INSTITUTIONAL ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES HAVE ENABLED ECONOMIC ACTORS TO SOLVE FOR INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES AND CONSTRAINTS IN THE DOMESTIC REALM BY USING FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS, THEREBY LIMITING THE EMERGENCE OF A DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW REGIME. WE ARGUE THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES LOWER THE PROPENSITY OF ASSET-HOLDERS, NORMALLY INTERESTED IN STRONG INSTITUTIONS AT HOME, TO ORGANIZE COLLECTIVE ACTION TO LOBBY FOR BETTER INSTITUTIONS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE MAIN WAYS THROUGH WHICH RUSSIA'S CAPITAL-OWNERS MAKE USE OF FOREIGN LEGAL AND FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURES SUCH AS CAPITAL FLIGHT, THE USE OF FOREIGN CORPORATE STRUCTURES, OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTERS, REAL ESTATE MARKETS, THE ROUND-TRIPPING OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, AND RELIANCE ON FOREIGN LAW IN CONTRACT-WRITING AND FOREIGN COURTS IN DISPUTE-RESOLUTION.
336	MEXICO HAS EXPERIENCED THE WORST CRISIS OF VIOLENCE IN ITS CONTEMPORARY HISTORY AS A RESULT OF THE WAR ON ORGANIZED CRIME (DRUG-TRAFFICKING) LAUNCHED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN 2007. DURING THIS WAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY (ARMY, POLICE) HAVE COMMITTED COUNTLESS VIOLATIONS OF THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE APPLIES A QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF THE POLITICAL AND JURIDICAL INTERVENTION BY MEXICO'S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE OF MICHOACAN IN 2014. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT ATTACKED THE CRIMES GENERATED BY THE OPERATIONS OF ORGANIZED DELINQUENT GROUPS BY COMMITTING VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW ITSELF; AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE LAWLESSNESS WITH MORE LAWLESSNESS. THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT'S LACK OF ANY DEAR COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW WEAKENS THE ACTIONS IT IMPLEMENTS TO COMBAT DRUG CARTELS, AND CONTRIBUTES TO PERPETUATING THE CORRUPTION THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN STRUCTURAL CAUSES OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.
337	THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL CHANGES UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY HAS CAUSED CERTITUDES ABOUT POLAND'S ROLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION TO TOTTER. YESTERDAY'S MODEL PUPIL IS NOW CREATING SERIOUS PROBLEMS. THIS IS PROVEN BY THE LAUNCHING OF RULE OF LAW PROCEEDINGS AGAINST POLAND OVER ITS CONSTITUTIONAL COURT LAW. THE REFUGEE CRISIS SHOWS THAT EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY NO LONGER WORKS. THIS HAS LED TO DISILLUSIONMENT IN BRUSSELS AND BERLIN. BUT IN ENERGY, NEIGHBOURHOOD, AND RUSSIA POLICY, AS WELL AS IN THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE GAS PIPELINE NORD STREAM 2, POLAND NEEDS PRECISELY THESE TWO PARTNERS. POLAND IS AT RISK OF STRUCTURAL MARGINALISATION WITHIN THE EU, BECAUSE IT IS WITHDRAWING FROM CENTRAL FIELDS OF POLICY, SUCH AS THE EURO, SCHENGEN BORDER AGREEMENT, AND ASYLUM POLICY. THE LAW AND JUSTICE CAMP IS INCREASINGLY CALLING INTO QUESTION EU MECHANISMS OF FUNCTIONING. SIMULTANEOUSLY, EUROPE'S POSITIVE IMAGE IN SOCIETY IS ERODING. POLAND'S EUROPEAN CALLING FACES A HISTORIC TEST.
338	THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS POSITIONED ITSELF AGAINST THE MILITARIZED DISCOURSE OF THE BUSH-ERA GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT) BY ARTICULATING A RETURN TO THE RULE OF LAW'. AND YET, THE FIGURE OF THE US DECISION-MAKER REMAINS AS MASCULINIZED AND MILITARILY-ORIENTED AS EVER. I DEMONSTRATE THIS SEEMING INCONGRUITY THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF: FIRST, THE DECISION TO RENDER THE CHRISTMAS DAY (WOULD-BE) BOMBER OF 2009 TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, A DECISION FOR WHICH OBAMA WAS LABELLED WEAK' (HENCE FEMININE) ON TERRORISM; AND SECOND, THE KILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN BY THE US NAVY SEALS SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM, A DECISION WHICH REAFFIRMED OBAMA'S WARRIOR CREDENTIALS, SINCE IT PROVED THAT HE WAS THE STRONG' (HENCE MASCULINE) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. BOTH CASES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE HEGEMONY OF THE MASCULINE WARRIOR DECISION-MAKER' REMAINS PRIVILEGED AND FACILITATES THE RE-EMERGENCE OF THE GWOT WAR MACHINE', DESPITE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO CHANGE.
339	CHINA'S NEW LEADER, XI JINPING, HAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO SET CHINA ON ITS NEW PATH WITH CONSEQUENCES OF HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS. XI NOW HAS SUFFICIENT POWER AND THE LATITUDE TO SET RIGHT THE MISSTEPS MADE BY HIS PREDECESSORS, ADDRESS THE CALLS FOR POLITICAL REFORM, AND CONTINUE ON THE ROAD TO SOCIALISM. IF XI JINPING DOES NOT TAKE AN UNAMBIGUOUS STAND AGAINST DICTATORSHIP, ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW, AND INSTALL A SYSTEM OF MERITOCRACY WITH INTRA-PARTY DEMOCRACY, THEN POLITICAL INSTABILITY MAY INTENSIFY AND AFFECT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CPC) RULE. THE AUTHOR PRESENTS TEN CHALLENGES FOR XI, SOME OF WHICH ARE TO ENCOURAGE A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY; PUT IN PLACE ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL REFORM, FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH; ESTABLISH A NEW GLOBAL OUTLOOK; REEXAMINE MARXISM; REPOSITION THE CPC; AND REVIVE THE SCHOLAR-GENTRY CIVIL SERVICE. THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS TO LEAD A CULTURED AND MODERN CHINA INTO THE FUTURE.
340	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEFINE ECONOMIC SECURITY AS A COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO REDISTRIBUTE INCOMES THROUGH A STRONG GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BY PRACTICING RULE OF LAW, ELIMINATING CORRUPTION AND A GOVERNMENT THAT ACTS AS A FACILITATOR BY FORMULATING EFFECTIVE FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY AND REGULATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER USES TWO STAGE INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS AND CARRIES OUT SECOND ORDER ASYMPTOTIC TESTS TO ESTABLISH THE VALIDITY OF THE INSTRUMENTS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COURTS THAT IMPLEMENT NATIONAL LAWS EFFECTIVELY AND PUNISH CORRUPTION AND A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BALANCE BUDGETS AND INVESTMENT FRIENDLY MONETARY POLICY ENSURES ECONOMIC SECURITY BY MEANS OF WELFARE FRIENDLY OUTCOMES THAT FAVOR THE INCOMES OF THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS. THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE THAT REDISTRIBUTION TAKES PLACE FROM RICH TO THE POOR. AS A RESULT, INCOME AND WAGE INEQUALITIES FALL DOWN. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER ADDS TO THE LITERATURE ON INSTITUTIONS BY PROVIDING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND INEQUALITY.
341	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF REPORTING INCENTIVES ON FIRM RESTATEMENTS IN FOREIGN AND U.S. MARKETS. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER FINANCIAL REPORTING, USING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) RESULTS IN QUALITY DISCLOSURES, GIVEN DIFFERENCES IN INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKET FORCES. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE QUALITY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH IFRS AND U.S. GAAP BY CONCENTRATING ON FIRM RESTATEMENTS AS A MEASURE OF EARNINGS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUE OF RESTATEMENTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS HIGH IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. FURTHERMORE, FIRMS WITH BETTER LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HIGHER TRADITIONS OF LAW AND ORDER, TEND TO HAVE SMALLER RESTATEMENT AMOUNTS OR LESS EARNINGS MANIPULATION. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THE QUALITY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED UNDER IFRS AND ITS DEPENDENCY ON THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AND MARKET FORCES OF A COUNTRY.

342	IN THE TRANSITION COUNTRIES, POLITICS AND ECONOMICS ARE SO CONNECTED AND INTERRELATED THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO TAKE HIGH GOVERNMENTAL POSITIONS OR WHO HAVE ECONOMIC POWER ABUSE THEIR STATUS IN ORDER TO MAKE HUGE PROFITS AND COMMIT CRIMINAL ACTS WITHOUT IMPUNITY. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO INDICATE THE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS KIND OF CRIME AND ITS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THE ABUSE OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER RESULTS IN INCREASING ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, DECREASING CHANCES OF ENTERING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS, AND FALLING ECONOMIC GROWTH. BESIDES, THIS CONTRIBUTES TO CREATING FERTILE SOIL FOR POPULISM AND SUPPORTING POLITICAL ELITES THAT ARE NOT COMMITTED TO BUILDING RULE OF LAW, STABLE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND FAIR MARKET ECONOMY. AS A RESULT, CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE AND ITS INSTITUTIONS WEAKENS, WHILE THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM OF VALUES IN THE SOCIETY IS JEOPARDISED. IN THIS WAY, THE SOCIETY BECOMES THE VICTIM OF IRRESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS, AND OF THOSE WHO ABUSE THEIR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POWER.
343	IS IT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHETHER A GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO ELIMINATE ITS ACCOUNTABILITY OR AIMS FOR PUBLIC TRUST OR EFFICACY GROWTH? MOREOVER, WHICH ELEMENTS IN THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS DIFFERENTIATE VALID CRITICISM FROM AN ATTACK ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY? THIS PAPER PROPOSES AN ORIGINAL APPROACH TOWARD RECOGNIZING AN ATTACK ON THE JUDICIARY. WHILE PREVIOUS APPROACHES FOCUSED ON THE REFORMER'S MOTIVATION, ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, OR THE REQUIREMENT OF THE "TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY THE LAW," THIS APPROACH IS LOOKING FOR A KERNEL OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND FINDS IT IN SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR A JUDGE'S FREE AND IMPARTIAL DECISION. IN THE PAPER, CHANGES IN HUNGARY AND POLAND WILL BE COMPARED TO THE SLOVAK JUDICIAL REFORM SINCE 2020. WHILE AFTER THREE DECADES AFTER THE FALL OF STATE SOCIALISM, HUNGARY, POLAND, AND SLOVAKIA FACE SIMILAR PROBLEMS OF BACKSLIDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EMERGING POPULISM, DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS, INTERPRETATIONS, AND OUTCOMES OF THE JUDICIAL REFORMS CAN BE SEEN IN SLOVAKIA.
344	WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF ECOLOGICAL LIVABILITY IN CHINESE RURAL SOCIETY, THE ISSUE OF RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE HAS RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTION FROM THE CCP AND THE GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, DUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND THE "URBAN AND RURAL BINARY" STRUCTURE OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE, RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE FACES MANY DILEMMAS, SUCH AS LACK OF NORMATIVE STANDARDS, LACK OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE SUBJECTS, AND LACK OF JUDICIAL SECURITY. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION AND REALIZE ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A SOLUTION PATH FOR RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE IDEA OF THE COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE FOR HUMANITY. SPECIFICALLY, THIS SOLUTION PATH INCLUDES ESTABLISHING THE CONCEPTS OF COOPERATION AND GOVERNANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, IMPROVING VILLAGERS' PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, BALANCING ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS IN RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE, AND BUILDING A LONG-TERM MECHANISM FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN RURAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE.
345	PROVINCIAL MENTAL HEALTH ACTS IN CANADA CODIFY POLICE POWERS TO APPREHEND OR TAKE A PERSON TO A HEALTH FACILITY INVOLUNTARILY. THE ACTS PROVIDE LIMITED GUIDANCE ON THE SCOPE OF THESE POWERS AND HOW POLICE SHOULD CARRY OUT APPREHENSIONS. COURTS ADDRESS THESE POWERS IN A BODY OF CASES DEALING WITH OBSTRUCTION OR POSSESSION OFFENCES BUT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE ISSUE OF THE AUTHORITY TO APPREHEND. THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA'S DECISION IN R V LE (2019) ALTERS THE LANDSCAPE FOR INVOLUNTARY APPREHENSION IN CANADA BY IMPORTING FROM JURISPRUDENCE ON SEARCH AND SEIZURE A REQUIREMENT THAT A DETENTION NOT ONLY BE AUTHORIZED BY A REASONABLE LAW BUT ALSO THAT IT BE CARRIED OUT IN A REASONABLE MANNER. WE CONTEND THAT, IN ADDITION TO BEING AUTHORIZED TO APPREHEND, POLICE MUST CARRY OUT A REASONABLE APPREHENSION. DRAWING ON CASE LAW ON REASONABLY CONDUCTED SEARCHES, WE SET OUT CONDITIONS OF A REASONABLE APPREHENSION AND ANTICIPATE A JURISPRUDENCE THAT MAY BRING POLICE CONDUCT IN CLOSER CONFORMITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
346	THIS RESEARCH MAKES A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE ON THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF FISCAL POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY BY MODELING EMPIRICALLY THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON PUBLIC DEBT IN 27 TRANSITION COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2018. APPLYING ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (OLS), RANDOM EFFECTS, AND TWO-STEP GMM METHODS, THE RESEARCH GIVES EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM THE BACKGROUND THEORY THAT DEDUCING PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND IMPROVING GOVERNMENT REVENUE COULD PUSH GOVERNMENT DEBT LOWER. THE MAIN FINDINGS ESPECIALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CONTRIBUTES TO MAKING AN IMPACT ON PUBLIC DEBT. PARTICULARLY, WEAK GOVERNANCE IN CONTROLLING CORRUPTION LEADS TO HIGHER ACCUMULATION OF PUBLIC DEBT WHILE FINANCING TO IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN RELATION TO GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW AFTER CHANGES IN THE REGIME IN THOSE COUNTRIES INCREASES THE SIZE OF PUBLIC DEBT. THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER CONVINCE POLICYMAKERS OF CRUCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF BOTH FISCAL POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN MANAGING PUBLIC DEBT.
347	THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE SEA BY INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AMONG INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS. IN RETROSPECT, THE CREATIVE JURISPRUDENCE OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL BODIES WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW-MAKING PROCESS IN MANY CASES, WHILE THE EXPERIENCE OF FAILURE CANNOT BE IGNORED. IN THE PAST DECADE, THE STRENGTHENING OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAS BECOME A TENDENCY IN INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE CONTENT AND SCOPE OF DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATION HAS BEEN DISCOVERED, CONSOLIDATED AND EXTENDED. IN LIGHT OF THE EVOLUTION OF DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATION, THE METHODOLOGY OF LAW-MAKING BY INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL BODIES INCLUDES: INTER ALIA, INTERPRETATION, CROSS-REFERENCE OF PRECEDENTS, ANALOGY, AND ASSERTION. HOWEVER, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEGITIMACY, LAW-MAKING SHOULD NOT BECOME THE NORMAL FUNCTION OF INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL BODIES. BEARING IN MIND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND GOOD ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, THE LAWMAKING ACTIVITIES OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS SHOULD BE CURTAILED IN CERTAIN DEGREE.
348	THIS ARTICLE REVEALS AN EVOLVING JUDICIAL DOCTRINE, IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL POSTPONES, REMOVES, DISMISSES, OR EVEN DISMISSES IN LIMINE PETITIONS, DUE TO THE MERE EXISTENCE OF LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE WITH RESPECT TO THE PETITION'S ISSUE. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE WAY THE COURT USES THE DOCTRINE, AND OFFERS A NORMATIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS PHENOMENON. THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT THE JUDICIAL USE OF THE DOCTRINE LEADS TO DEPRIVATION OF THE PETITIONERS' RIGHTS, GIVES (TOO) MUCH POWER TO THE STATE LEGAL COUNSELS, LEANS ON UNCERTAIN AND UNFORESEEABLE SITUATIONS, AND DAMAGES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE JUDICIAL USE OF THE DOCTRINE PROMOTES AND ENHANCES CONSTITUTIONAL DIALOGUE, AS WELL AS PRESERVING JUDICIAL RESOURCES (AND JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY IN PARTICULAR) AND THE PROFESSIONALITY OF THE LEGISLATION. HENCEFORTH, THE ARTICLE ALSO INTRODUCES AN EFFORT TO BALANCE BETWEEN THE DOCTRINE DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCES, BY PRESENTING A SET OF CRITERIA FOR A MORE REASONED, COHERENT, AND ANALYTICAL USE OF THAT DOCTRINE.
349	THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON OBSERVING THE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC LIGHTS AT TWO ROAD CROSSINGS AND THREE JUNCTION CROSSINGS LOCATED IN BANGKOK, THAILAND. THE DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED FOR TRAFFIC LIGHT PHASES AND PEDESTRIAN LIGHT PHASES. ALL ARE PEDESTRIAN TWO-WAY CROSSINGS. EACH CROSSING WIDTH IS MEASURED. THE MINIMUM GREEN SIGNAL LENGTHS ARE COMPUTED USING THE CROSSING WIDTH INFORMATION. THESE ARE COMPARED WITH THE ACTUAL GREEN SIGNAL LENGTHS FOR ALL CROSSINGS. THE STUDY FINDS THAT ACTUAL GREEN SIGNAL LENGTHS ARE NOT ENOUGH. THE WARNING REMAINING TIME FOR PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS IS NOT ENOUGH THAT PEDESTRIANS NEEDS TO RUN TO GET THROUGH CAUSING UNSAFE CONDITIONS. PEDESTRIANS ALSO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE PEDESTRIANS RULE OF LAW THAT THEY SHOULD STOP WHEN WARNING OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC LIGHT SHOWING AS FLASHING. THE MINIMUM PEDESTRIANS GREEN INTERVAL LENGTHS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WITH PEDESTRIANS STARTUP LOST TIME AND CROSSING WIDTH. DISCIPLINARY: CIVIL ENGINEERING (TRAFFIC ENGINEERING).

350	OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST 39 YEARS' REFORMS, CHINA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THIS RAPID DEVELOPMENT, CHINA NOW FACES SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT HAVE CREATED ENORMOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES. TO CONFRONT THIS CRISIS, CHINA'S GOVERNMENT HAS ENTHUSIASTICALLY PROMOTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILISATION AND THE RULE OF LAW TO ADDRESS THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE (EEID) SYSTEM HAS CONSEQUENTLY BECOME AN IMPORTANT LINK IN CHINA'S NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. NEVERTHELESS, THE CURRENT SYSTEM EXHIBITS A RANGE OF SHORTCOMINGS, AND RECENT INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE AUGUST 2015 EXPLOSION IN TIANJIN HAVE BROUGHT SUCH ISSUES CLEARLY INTO THE PUBLIC'S FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S EEID SYSTEM, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND THE CAUSES OF KEY LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS. IT ARGUES THAT A ROBUST SYSTEM FOR IMPLEMENTING EEID AND BOTTOM-UP ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS WILL HELP CURB CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION.
351	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW FRAGMENTATION OF THE GLOBAL TRADE REGIME INTO PREFERENTIAL AGREEMENTS, BUILT ON A MULTILATERAL BASELINE OF WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) RULES, AFFECTS TRADE GOVERNANCE. THE ANALYSIS RELIES ON 105 INTERVIEWS WITH TRADE POLICY PROFESSIONALS IN CORE WTO MEMBERS AND A CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THICK' AND THIN' INSTITUTIONALISM TO CAPTURE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL TRADE GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE. THE WTO'S THICK INSTITUTIONALISM FACILITATES INSTITUTIONALIZED INTERACTIONS AMONG MEMBERS OF THE TRADE POLICY COMMUNITY THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSPARENCY AND DIALOGUE AND THE RULE OF LAW CHARACTER OF THE TRADE REGIME. IT SECURES THE CONTINUED BELIEF OF TRADE POLICY PROFESSIONALS IN THE WTO'S CENTRALITY IN TRADE GOVERNANCE. THE THIN INSTITUTIONALISM OF THE NETWORK OF PREFERENTIAL AGREEMENTS SPELLS THE RETURN TO A LA CARTE FORMS OF TRADE GOVERNANCE AND BENEFITS THOSE WITH THE TECHNICAL AND POLITICAL CAPACITY TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE. ONGOING INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS SHIFT GLOBAL TRADE GOVERNANCE AWAY FROM RULES-BASED BACK TO MORE POWER-BASED FORMS.
352	THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS ARTICLE IS IMPARTIALITY. IT IS ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A DEMOCRATIC STATE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT FOR JUDICIARY TO PLAY A CERTAIN ROLE. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON A THEORY THAT THE LEGISLATURE AIMS FOR THE IMPARTIALITY TO BE BOTH THE COURT'S (AS AN INSTITUTION) AND THE JUDGE'S, (AS A PERSON) FEATURE. THE AUTHOR POINTS TO A SIMILAR MEANING OF THE NOTIONS: AUTONOMY, INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY. MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE TERMS. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPARTIALITY FOR BUILDING AND ENHANCING THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THE JUDICIARY. THIS ANALYSIS TOUCHES ON THE IMPARTIALITY AS AN UNBIASED DECISION AS WELL AS THE IMPARTIAL DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURE. ANOTHER ASPECT DISCUSSED IN THIS ESSAY IS BUILDING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY'S IMPARTIALITY. IT'S ONE ISSUE TO RESPECT THE PROCEDURAL IMPARTIALITY SAFEGUARDS AND ANOTHER ONE TO CREATE A SOCIAL PERCEPTION OF THE COURT'S IMPARTIALITY.
353	THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT ANALYZING THE CURRENT ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZED IN IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC SETUP OF THE BRAZILIAN STATE. TO THIS END, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THROUGH A LITERATURE REVIEW AND APPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHETICAL DEDUCTIVE METHOD, THE EVOLUTION AND THE CURRENT APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND THIRD SECTOR. AS A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE IT WAS CONCEPTUALLY DEMONSTRATED WHAT DEMOCRACY STAND FOR, ITS FUNCTION TODAY, COLLATING CLASSIC AND CURRENT AUTHORS. THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE CLASSIC CONSTITUTIONAL PARADIGMS AND THE NEED FOR REALIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW NOW HAS BEEN SHOWN. THE CONCEPTS OF THE THIRD SECTOR AND ITS FUNCTION OF ACTING AS AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL CHANGE WERE ALSO ANALYZED. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE THIRD SECTOR IS AN INSTRUMENT THAT SEEKS THE REALIZATION OF CURRENT BRAZILIAN DEMOCRACY, BESIDES HAVING A ROLE OF SERVICE PROVIDER THAT WOULD IMMINENTLY BE A RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE STATE.
354	GOVERNANCE IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA PRESENTS EXTERNAL ANALYSTS WITH A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS HOW TO USE GENERAL POLITICAL SCIENCE MODELS TO ADEQUATELY CONCEPTUALIZE THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA-A HYBRID FORCE THAT AIMS TO COVER ALL POSSIBLE POLITICAL TERRITORY IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC AND PERFORM A FUNCTION WHICH IS MORE EXTENSIVE AND YET MORE ABSTRACT THAN POLITICAL PARTIES IN LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. USING THE THREE AREAS OF GOVERNMENT MODERNIZATION REFERRED TO BY FRANCIS FUKUYAMA-THE STATE, RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY-THIS ESSAY LOOKS AT THE WAYS IN WHICH THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS ENGAGED IN A PROGRESS OF PARTIAL REFORM, TACTICALLY CONCEDING SPACE FOR OTHER ACTORS IN SOME AREAS, WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THE CORE ISSUE FOR CONTROL-POLITICAL ORGANIZATION AND THE ARTICULATION OF BROAD OVERARCHING GOALS FOR CHINESE SOCIETY, AND HOW IT HAS ATTEMPTED TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE-CREATE A MODERN, DEVELOPED, MARKET ECONOMY WHILE STILL BEING GOVERNED BY A COMMUNIST PARTY EXERCISING A MONOPOLY ON POWER.
355	THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE REASONS THAT PROVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS A STRENGTH FOR THE TRANSITION PROCESSES OF POT IN COLOMBIA. IT EXPOSES THE WAYS IN WHICH LAND MANAGEMENT IS DEFINED THROUGH THE LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ITS URBAN MANIFESTATION PREVAILS AS AN EXPLICIT DETERMINANT OF HIGHER RANK, TO THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES, IN WHAT CONCERNS THE FORMULATION, ADOPTION, AND IMPLEMENTION OF A POT. THE AFOREMENTIONED SET OF DETERMINANTS ARE DESCRIBED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT BOTH THE CONSTITUTION OF 1991 AND THE SO CALLED CONSTITUTIONAL BLOCK SERVE AS PILLARS UPON WHICH THE ENVIRONMENT ACQUIRES THE STATUS OF BOTH FORMAL DETERMINANT AS WELL AS THAT OF VALID MATERIAL. BASED ON SUCH A JURIDICAL STATUS, AND FROM THE INCIDENCE OF THE ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF PROPERTY, THE ENVIRONMENT ACQUIRES BINDING POWER, WITH RIGHTS THAT IT ENCOMPASSES UNDER AN ADEQUATE TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO HOUSING.
356	THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION STRUGGLED THROUGHOUT ITS FIRST TERM TO LIVE UP TO ITS CAMPAIGN PROMISES TO REVERSE THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S COUNTERTERRORISM POLICIES AND TO GOVERN BY "RULE OF LAW" PRINCIPLES. IT IS CLEAR THAT MOST OF THESE POLICIES CONTINUED WITH MINIMAL CHANGES, AND SOME EVEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS TARGETED KILLINGS. THE MOST VISIBLE POLICY FAILURE HAS BEEN THE INABILITY TO CLOSE THE MILITARY PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY. EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS CLOSURE BECAME ENTWINED WITH TWO OTHER UNFULFILLED CAMPAIGN PROMISES-REJECTION OF THE USE OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS FOR PROSECUTING TERRORIST SUSPECTS AND HALTING THE PRACTICE OF INDEFINITE DETENTION OF UNCHARGED SUSPECTS. IN THIS ARTICLE I ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE RIVALRY FOR INFLUENCE BETWEEN WHITE HOUSE POLITICAL ADVISORS AND POLICY PRINCIPALS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH LEGAL ADVISORS, ON THE OTHER, ON THE FAILURE TO ROLL BACK BUSH'S COUNTERTERRORISM POLICIES.
357	CORRUPTION IS A UNIVERSAL AND SPECIFIC PHENOMENON OF MULTIFACTOR AND MULTI ASPECT CHARACTER AND IT EMBRACES A LOT OF SHADES AND TYPES. THIS ESTABLISHES A WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PHENOMENON IN SOCIAL SCIENCE AND LAW. CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY ARE TYPES OF FRAUD AND ARE LINKED WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TOO. ALTHOUGH CERTAIN TYPES OF CORRUPTION WILL DECLINE AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR GROWS AND CONSOLIDATES, OTHER NEW TYPES INVOLVING PRIVATE SECTOR FIRMS MAY INCREASE. COMMERCIAL CORRUPTION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS RELATION INSIDE OF AN ORGANIZATION AND AS RELATION BETWEEN FIRMS. WEAK INSTITUTIONS, AN UNCERTAIN RULE OF LAW, INSECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS, A LACK OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF SHORT TERM FOCUS THAT CAUSES CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN POLAND IS CONNECTED WITH SOCIAL DISTRUST AND SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE TOO. SUCH CORRUPTION IS A GENUINE THREAT AND CREATES NEW DANGERS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, CAUSES LOSS OF COMPETITIVENESS AND CREATES A SUBSTITUTE FOR FAIR MARKET AND COMPETITION IN THE POLISH ECONOMY AND ABROAD.
358	AS STATES GET STRONGER, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING INSURGENCY AND, IN TURN, THE OCCURRENCE OF CIVIL WARS. WHILE INTUITIVELY APPEALING, THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE LINKAGE BETWEEN STATE CAPACITY AND CIVIL WAR ONSET REMAINS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. TO DATE, THE ROLE OF STATE CAPACITY HAS BEEN CONCEPTUALISED AND MEASURED IN LIMITED WAYS THAT FOCUS MAINLY ON THE REPRESSIVE ABILITY OF THE STATE. IN THIS PAPER, WE BROADEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF STATE CAPACITY BY INCORPORATING AN IMPORTANT BUT NEGLECTED DIMENSION; INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND CIVIL WAR ONSET AND ARGUE THAT STATES CHARACTERISED WITH HIGH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ARE LESS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE CIVIL WAR. ANALYSIS OF CROSS-NATIONAL TIME-SERIES DATA FROM 1984 TO 1999 REVEALS THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, DEFINED AS FREEDOM FROM CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT, RULE OF LAW, AND BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN EXPLAINING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CIVIL WAR ONSET.
359	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL PARTY FINANCING IN MULTIPARTY KENYA. IT USES THE GOLDENBERG AND ANGLO-LEASING MEGA-SCANDALS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION, PARTICULARLY CAMPAIGN FINANCING, ARGUING THAT IT HAS INCREASED UNDER MULTIPARTY RULE AND AFFECTED THE NATURE OF GOVERNANCE. IT HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND COMPETITION, THE RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ILLEGAL FUNDS TO FINANCE THE KENYA AFRICAN NATIONAL UNION'S ELECTIONS IN THE 1990S WERE RAISED THROUGH THE GOLDENBERG AFFAIR, WHEREAS THOSE AIMED AT FINANCING THE NATIONAL RAINBOW COALITION'S ELECTIONS IN DECEMBER 2007 WERE TO BE RAISED THROUGH THE ANGLO-LEASING SCANDAL. CORRUPT CAMPAIGN FINANCING, THEREFORE, POSES A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IN THE COUNTRY. THE DEMOCRATIC SPACE CREATED AND EXPANDED BY MULTIPARTYISM HAS, HOWEVER, PROVIDED NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR WAGING THE WAR AGAINST CORRUPTION. IT IS IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE ARGUMENTS THAT THE CONCLUSION RAISES BROADER ISSUES FOR CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA.
360	DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS 1997-1998, SOUTH KOREA, INDONESIA, AND THAILAND RESORTED TO AN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) BAILOUT. IN EXCHANGE, THE IMF DEMANDED A SERIES OF REFORMS INTENDED TO PROMOTE RULE-BASED INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY FOUND IN ADVANCED WESTERN ECONOMIES, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW. USING PANEL DATA ANALYSIS FROM 1982 TO 2007, WE TEST EMPIRICALLY WHETHER JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, ONE OF THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL RULE-BASED INSTITUTIONS, CAN POSITIVELY EXPLAIN THE GROWTH OF THESE COUNTRIES AFTER THE CRISIS, AND FIND THE IMPACT OF REFORMS TO BE LIMITED. TO UNDERSTAND WHY, WE USE SOUTH KOREA AS AN EXAMPLE TO SHOW THAT TOP-DOWN REFORMS BY THE GOVERNMENT PREVENTED A SHIFT TOWARDS A RULE-BASED ECONOMY. DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT SELECTIVELY BAILING OUT BIG BUSINESSES, BIG BUSINESSES THAT SURVIVED THE CRISIS CAPTURED MARKET SHARES ONCE OWNED BY THE DISSOLVED BIG BUSINESSES, BECOMING TOO POWERFUL FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO REGULATE. THIS RESEARCH USES SOIFER'S THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK ON CRITICAL JUNCTURES.
361	IN THE RENAISSANCE OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION THEORY, A DIVISION HAS EMERGED BETWEEN "NEW PURPOSIVISTS," WHO ARGUE THAT STATUTES SHOULD BE INTERPRETED DYNAMICALLY, AND "NEW TEXTUALISTS," WHO ARGUE THAT STATUTES SHOULD BE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THEIR ORDINARY SEMANTIC MEANINGS. BOTH CAMPS, HOWEVER, REST THEIR THEORIES ON JURISPRUDENTIALLY AMBIVALENT COMMITMENTS. PURPOSIVISTS ARE JURISPRUDENTIAL REALISTS WHEN THEY MAKE ARGUMENTS ABOUT STATUTORY MEANING, BUT THEY ARE JURISPRUDENTIAL FORMALISTS IN THEIR VIEWS OF THE JUDICIAL POWER TO ENGAGE IN DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION. TEXTUALISTS ARE THE INVERSE; THEY ARE FORMALISTIC IN THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS OF STATUTORY MEANING BUT REALISTIC IN THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT JUDICIAL POWER. THE RELATIVE TRIUMPH OF TEXTUALISM HAS THEREFORE BEEN AN IMPORTANTLY INCOMPLETE TRIUMPH OF FORMALISM, AND IT HAS LEFT JUDGES AND SCHOLARS ALIKE IN A POSITION OF JURISPRUDENTIAL INCOHERENCE. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE AMBIVALENCE OF MODERN INTERPRETIVE THEORY AND THEN OFFERS SOME INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THE HARMS OF THIS AMBIVALENCE TO THE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES THAT BOTH SIDES ARE TRYING TO ADVANCE.
362	INFORMAL SYSTEMIC PRACTICES IN SERBIA EMBEDDED IN THE POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MILIEU IMPAIR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM EFFORTS. FORMAL RULES PRODUCE NO REAL INCENTIVES FOR ACHIEVING EFFECTIVE REFORM OUTCOMES AND SUPPRESSING THESE INFORMALITIES. EXTERNAL CONDITIONALITY PROVIDES INCENTIVES AS IT PUTS PRESSURE ON INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS TO PURSUE REFORMS, PROMISING THE OFTEN VAGUE BUT IMPORTANT PROSPECT OF EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP. ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE IN INITIATING CHANGE IN FORMAL PROCEDURES, EXTERNAL INCENTIVES STILL FALL SHORT OF DECONSTRUCTING INFORMAL PRACTICES THAT CIRCUMVENT WRITTEN NORMS AND STANDARDS, DESPITE PRESSURES AND CONDITIONALITY. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT PARALLELISM BETWEEN FORMAL RULES THAT EXIST ON PAPER, AND REALITY, WHICH IS RESISTANT TO THESE SAME RULES, RESULTS IN A "REFORM FAKING" SYNDROME CHARACTERIZED BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF FORMAL STANDARDS THAT THE SYSTEM FINDS DIFFICULT TO ABSORB, DESPITE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DEMANDS TO APPLY THEM. THE PAPER GOES ON TO ARGUE THAT THE EMBEDDED PRACTICE OF FABRICATING REFORMS CARRIES LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR SYSTEM STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
363	THERE IS A CONSENSUS AMONG POLICYMAKERS, LAWMAKERS, LEGAL SCHOLARS AND "WE THE PEOPLE" IN THE WESTERN WORLD, THAT DEMOCRACY IS A BLESSING. HOWEVER, HOW DO WE DEFEND DEMOCRACY FROM ANTI-DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PARTIES THAT AIM TO OVERTHROW THE DEMOCRATIC REGIME BY ABUSING THE GUARANTEES AND THE TOLERANCE OF DEMOCRACY? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE ARE THREE PUBLIC POLICY OPTIONS: THE TRADITIONAL MODEL THAT PERMITS THE DISSOLUTION OF ANTI-DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PARTIES; THE BUSINESS AS USUAL MODEL, THAT REGULATES SUCH PARTIES WITH ORDINARY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND CONTROLS THE CONDUCT OF THEIR MEMBERS VIA ORDINARY CRIMINAL LAW; AND FINALLY, THE STRATEGIC MODEL THAT EMPLOYS AN ELECTORAL SYSTEM ACCORDING TO WHICH POLITICAL PARTIES, LIKE THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC, HAVING MORE ENEMIES THAN SUPPORTERS ARE OSTRACISED. THAT SAID, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE ELECTORAL LAW IS THE MOST RULE-OF-LAW BASED MECHANISM TO SAFEGUARD DEMOCRACIES FROM ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PARTIES, NOT ALL ELECTORAL SYSTEMS ARE CAPABLE. ONLY THE ELECTORAL SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW FOR "STRATEGIC VOTING" CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE.
364	TODAY, CONCEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE WIDELY USED IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, BOTH TO DESCRIBE AND TO PROMOTE CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IN SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER COMMON VALUES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE PRESENT ARTICLE DEALS WITH A QUESTION SO FAR ADDRESSED ONLY CURSORILY-THE "WRITTENNESS" OF INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. CAN WE ASSUME THE EXISTENCE OF AN "UNWRITTEN" INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTION, OR DOES THE VERY CONCEPT OF A CONSTITUTION IN THE MODERN SENSE REQUIRE THAT A CONSTITUTION IS LAID DOWN IN WRITTEN FORM? THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF "WRITTENNESS" IN MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND ADDRESSES THE "ENGLISH EXCEPTION", THAT IS THE ABSENCE, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, OF A DOCUMENT CALLED "THE CONSTITUTION". THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A PLEA FOR TAKING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARACTER OF THE UN CHARTER MORE SERIOUSLY, ARGUING THAT THE IDEA OF AN UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DOES NOT PROVIDE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE.
365	COUNTRY RISK PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BUSINESS DECISIONS AND MAY INFLUENCE INVESTORS' INTEREST. THE AUTHORS OF THIS ARTICLE TRY TO FIND A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COUNTRY RISK INDICATORS, AND THE FINANCIAL REPORTING NUMBERS AND FINANCIAL MARKET INDICATORS. INVESTORS NEED HIGH QUALITY ACCOUNTING NUMBERS TO AVOID BAD DECISIONS. SOME COMPANIES TEND TO MANIPULATE THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTING NUMBERS BY USING EARNINGS MANAGEMENT OR OTHER TECHNIQUES. THE MEASUREMENT AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING QUALITY METRICS, TOGETHER WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE COUNTRY RISK INDICATORS CAN HELP INVESTORS IN FINDING GOOD BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO MEASURE AND ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE COUNTRY RISK ESPECIALLY THE RULE OF LAW COMPONENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION REPORTED BY 64 ROMANIAN LISTED COMPANIES, IN THE PERIOD OF 2007-2015. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF THE COUNTRY RISK ON THE QUALITY OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTS OF THESE COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY ON THE COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN SHAREHOLDERS.
366	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGITIMACY ACROSS 20 EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES (1990-2010). THE CLAIM IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE OF PARTIES AFFECTS LEVELS OF LEGITIMACY. A CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL DISCUSSION IS PRESENTED TO ESTABLISH THIS RELATIONSHIP. DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE IS CHARACTERISED BY TRUSTING PARTIES TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE ELECTORATE AND RESPONSIBLE IN GOVERNMENT. LEGITIMACY IS DEFINED AS A COMPOSITE MEASURE REPRESENTING SATISFACTION WITH PARTIES, COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS VOTER TURNOUT AND WILLINGNESS TO PROTEST. THE RESPONSIVENESS OF PARTIES APPEARS LESS REPRESENTATIVE ON PUBLIC CONCERNS AND GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY APPEARS CLOSER TO PARTY INTERESTS THAN TO THE GENERAL INTEREST. HENCE, A DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT' SEEMS TO HAVE EMERGED ACROSS EUROPE, MANIFESTED BY MORE ELECTORAL VOLATILITY, NEW PARTIES AND ALTERNATION IN GOVERNMENT AND LOWER SURVIVAL RATES OF GOVERNMENTS. THIS NEGATIVELY AFFECTS TRUST IN PARTIES, PARLIAMENT AND GOVERNMENT EFFICACY. HENCE, PARTY BEHAVIOUR HAS NOT STRONGLY CONTRIBUTED TO POLITICAL LEGITIMACY SINCE THE 1990S.
367	FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE LATEST CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENTS, REFLECTED ON 7/2003 OR 5/2010 ORGANIC LAWS, WE CAN CONCLUDE AN EAGERNESS IN TIGHTENING PENALTIES AND THEIR EXECUTION CONDITIONS, HINDERING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE LIBERTY OF CERTAIN CRIMINALS, EXPANDING THE SITUATIONS THAT INVOLVE THE CRIMINAL LAW AND EXTENDING THE INTERVENTION BEYOND THE PRISON RELEASE. EXPERT VOICES-WHICH HAVE BEEN SILENCED BY MEANS OF POPULAR AND POLITICAL ALARMIST SPEECHES THAT BLOW THE PROBLEM UP OUT OF ALL PROPORTION AND CAN GENERATE A DANGEROUS ASPIRATION OF "NO RISK" IN THE ORWELLIAN BIG BROTHER STYLE, BASED ON A PERCEPTION OF INSECURITY THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE CONNECTED WITH REALITY- DEFINE THIS PHENOMENON AS A CRIMINAL LAW "EXPANSION", A RETURN TO VON LISZT AND HIS "NEUTRALIZATION" OF "INCORRIGIBLE" CRIMINALS CONSTRUCT, WHOSE MAJOR ARCHETYPE IS "ENEMY CRIMINAL LAW", THAT IMPEND WITH THE END OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND DUE PROCESS OF LAW THAT HAVE TAKEN SO MUCH EFFORT TO REACH IN THE RULE OF LAW.
368	USING FIRM-LEVEL DATA FROM A WORLD BANK SURVEY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW LEGAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA RELATES TO VARIOUS FIRM DECISIONS. I FIND THAT A MORE ACTIVE COURT SYSTEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE INVESTMENT, MORE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY, MORE INNOVATION, AND MORE COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS. SPECIFICALLY, WHEN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM, FIRMS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER INVESTMENT RATES, HIGHER PROPENSITIES TO ADOPT NEW AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY, AND HIGHER PROBABILITIES OF DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THEY TEND TO HAVE MORE NONLOCAL SALES. THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH A SOPHISTICATED VERSION OF THE RIGHTS HYPOTHESIS, IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW EVENTUALLY REPLACES RELATION-BASED GOVERNANCE AS A SUPERIOR GOVERNANCE MECHANISM. I FIND TWO LIMITATIONS OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. THE COURT SYSTEM DOES A BETTER JOB FACILITATING THE GROWTH OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES THAN OF PRIVATE FIRMS, AND IT PROTECTS LOCAL FIRMS BETTER THAN NONLOCAL FIRMS.
369	THE MYANMAR RESISTANCE'S URGENT TASK IS TO PUSH THE HATED, BRUTAL MILITARY OUT OF POLITI-CAL POWER ONCE AND FOR ALL. JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER, IT SIMULTANEOUSLY NEEDS TO CREATE THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS FOR ANY FUTURE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO SUCCEED. THIS GOAL WILL REQUIRE ADDRESSING A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT EITHER HAVE LIN-GERED UNRESOLVED FOR MANY YEARS OR THAT HAVE GROWN OUT OF THE POST-2021 COUP AND SUBSEQUENT CONFLICT. THESE INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING THE SECURITY FORCES, DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM OF FEDERALISM, BUILDING RULE OF LAW, TACKLING LONG-STANDING IDEN-TITY ISSUES, AND REBUILDING AND REINVIGORATING THE ECONOMY. IT WILL ALSO NEED TO ESTABLISH AN INTERIM GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND DECIDE HOW TO MAINTAIN SECURITY AND BASIC GOV-ERNANCE DURING THE INEVITABLE TRANSITION PERIOD. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD STEP UP EFFORTS TO HELP THE RESISTANCE ACHIEVE BOTH OF THESE GOALS, INCLUDING BY INCREAS-ING AID, TRAINING AND SCHOLARSHIPS AND ESTABLISHING A "FRIENDS OF MYANMAR DEMOCRACY GROUP" TO COORDINATE APPROACHES.
370	CORRUPTION REMAINS A PERVASIVE GLOBAL ISSUE WITH FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIETIES, ECONOMIES, AND THE RULE OF LAW. TO EFFECTIVELY UNDERSTAND AND COMBAT THIS COM-PLEX PHENOMENON, A ROBUST METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATION IS ES-SENTIAL FOR SOCIO-PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE KEY ASPECTS OF CORRUPTION ANALYSIS, HIGHLIGHTING THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THE PROBLEM. IT EMPHASIZES THE NEED TO EXAMINE SYSTEMIC FACTORS SUCH AS INSTITUTIONAL WEAK-NESSES AND TRANSPARENCY DEFICITS, ALONGSIDE UNDERSTANDING THE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE MOTIVATIONS THAT DRIVE CORRUPT BE-HAVIOR. THE ARTICLE ADVOCATES FOR A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS, AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO UNRAVEL THE INTRICATE DYNAMICS OF CORRUPTION. BY DELVING INTO THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL IMPACTS OF CORRUPTION, THIS ANALYSIS CONTRIBUTES TO A COMPRE-HENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF CORRUPTION'S ROOTS AND CONSEQUENC-ES. THE INSIGHTS DERIVED FROM THIS METHODOLOGICAL EXPLORATION CAN INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION AND STRENGTHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF A JUST AND AC-COUNTABLE SOCIETY.
371	THE FOUNDERS' CONSTITUTION-THE ONE THEY HAD BEFORE THE REVOLUTION AND THE ONE THEY FOUGHT THE REVOLUTION TO PRESERVE-WAS ONE IN WHICH VIOLENCE PLAYED A LAWMAKING ROLE. AN EMBRACE OF VIOLENCE TO ASSERT CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS IS WORKED DEEPLY INTO OUR INTELLECTUAL HISTORY AND CULTURE. IT WAS ENTAILED UPON US BY THE FOUNDING GENERATION, WHO SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE "ARE ONLY AS FREE AS THEY DESERVE TO BE " AND THAT ONE COULD TELL HOW MUCH FREEDOM PEOPLE DESERVED BY HOW MUCH BLOOD THEY WERE WILLING TO SHED TO OBTAIN IT. THIS CONSTITUTIONALISM OF FORCE SURVIVED RATIFICATION. ITS LEGACY IS A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER THAT LEGITIMIZES THE VIOLENT ASSERTION OF RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY BY GROUPS OF ARMED WHITE MEN- A LEGACY THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S STATEMENT THAT THE JANUARY 6 INSURRECTION AMOUNTED TO "LEGITIMATE POLITICAL DISCOURSE. " WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS HERITAGE AND THE PRESSURE IT IMPOSES ON THE RULE OF LAW IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE TODAY'S AUTHORITARIAN CHALLENGES TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
372	THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT GOVERN ALL HUMAN INTERACTIONS. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE STATE BYPASSES LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, AS DOCUMENTED BY THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT. OTHER TIMES, JURISDICTIONS MAY BE MUTUALLY UNFRIENDLY AND REFUSE TO ENFORCE FOREIGN LAWS. BLOCKCHAINS CREATE TRUST BETWEEN CONTRACTING PARTIES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, ENABLING THEM TO TRANSACT FREELY AND INCREASE CONSUMER WELFARE. BLOCKCHAINS CAN ONLY SUPPLEMENT ANTITRUST IF THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS DO NOT IMPEDE THEIR DEVELOPMENT. THE LAW SHOULD THUS SUPPORT THE DECENTRALIZATION OF BLOCKCHAINS SO THAT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED MECHANISMS MAY TAKE OVER (EVEN IF IMPERFECTLY) WHERE THE LAW DOES NOT APPLY. WITH THAT IN MIND, WE JUSTIFY THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THAT APPROACH BY SHOWING THAT BLOCKCHAIN CAUSES AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS BY CREATING TRUST (PART 1), AND THAT IT MAY OVERALL INCREASE THE DECENTRALIZATION OF ECONOMIC TRANSACTIONS (PART 2). THE LAW SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHERE IT APPLIES (PART 3). WE CONCLUDE AFTERWARD (PART 4).
373	THIS PAPER AIMS TO REFLECT ON THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION CONCERNING PERSONAL INFORMATION USED IN THE USER PERSONALIZATION PROCESS ON THE INTERNET. IN THIS CONTEXT, SEARCH ENGINES HAVE NOW BECOME SO RELEVANT IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL CONTEXT THAT IT IS BEING DESCRIBED AS THE FORMATION OF A NEW ERA, ESSENTIALLY CHARACTERIZED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE SEARCH MECHANISMS ESTABLISH STRUCTURES ENABLING ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERNET AND EACH OF ITS USERS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF EACH USER AND HIS OR HER PERSONAL INFORMATION BUBBLE, ON THE OTHER. AS RESULT OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT, THE ARTICLE FOLLOWS THE DEDUCTIVE APPROACH AND THE MONOGRAPHIC PROCEDURE METHODOLOGIES, SEEKING TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE THREATS TO THE SCOPE OF PROTECTION OF THE INTERNET USER IN THE CONSTANT QUEST FOR PERSONALIZATION OF THE INFORMATION DESIRED, AND THE ROLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION OVER PERSONAL INFORMATION IN UPKEEPING PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS ESSENTIAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
374	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS A WIDELY DISCUSSED TOPIC IN MANY FIELDS INCLUDING LAW. LEGAL STUDIES SCHOLARS, PARTICULARLY IN THE DOMAIN OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTERNET LAW, HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR HOPES AND CONCERNS REGARDING AI. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO STUDY HOW CANADA'S COURTS HAVE REFERRED TO AI, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONINGS OF JUSTICES TO THE POLICY MAKERS WHO DETERMINE SOCIETY'S RULES FOR THE USAGE OF AI IN THE FUTURE. DECISIONS FROM ALL LEVELS OF BOTH CANADA'S PROVINCIAL AND FEDERAL COURTS ARE USED AS THE DATA SOURCES FOR THIS RESEARCH. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE FOUR LEGAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH AI HAS BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE CANADIAN CASELAW INCLUDING: LEGAL RESEARCH, INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS, TRADEMARKS AND ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT RECORDS. IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHORS USE THESE FINDINGS TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS FOR LEGAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS ON HOW TO DEVELOP COLLECTIONS AND REFERENCE SERVICES THAT ARE IN LINE WITH THE NEW INFORMATION NEEDS OF THEIR USERS REGARDING AI AND THE RULE OF LAW.
375	EU DIRECTIVES ON AML (ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING)/CTF (COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING) ENTAIL INVOLUNTARY PUBLIC POLICY-MAKING BY FOR-PROFIT PROFESSIONALS ON POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ISSUES. THIS RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ON THE ROLE OF PRIVATE ACTORS IN PUBLIC POLICY-MAKING APART FROM THEIR ROLES AS LOBBYISTS AND CONTRACTORS. FROM A DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE, THE INVOLUNTARY PUBLIC POLICY-MAKING BY EUROPEAN LAWYERS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC AS IT INVOLVES GUARDIANS OF THE RULE OF LAW WHO, WE ARGUE, ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY FORCED TO ACT AS AGENTS OF THE STATE. IN THE CASE OF AML/CTF, LAWYERS ARE WITHIN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM RATHER THAN OUTSIDE IT. WE SHOW THAT EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING HOW LAWYERS ARE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE STATE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SWEDEN DIFFER, AND THAT THE POLICY-MAKING STYLES LAWYERS APPLY IN PRACTICE WERE EITHER 'PRAGMATIC' (UK) OR 'EVASIVE' (SWEDEN). OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE A FIRST STEP IN UNDERSTANDING THE NEW ROLE OF FOR-PROFIT PROFESSIONALS AS INVOLUNTARY PUBLIC POLICY-MAKERS, AND ITS POSSIBLE EFFECTS.
376	BUREAUCRATIZATION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CRITICIZED PROCESSES BY NEOLIBERAL DISCOURSES BUT IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED OR FADED AWAY. IT HAS JUST EVOLVED AND FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT TARGETS. THUS FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LEGITIMATELY CONSTITUTED AUTHORITY LINKED TO PERIOD OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, THERE IS A TRANSITION TO A NEW EXCHANGE OF INTERESTS AND RESOURCES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPHERES, LEGITIMIZED BY HIGHER EFFICIENCY AND PROFITABILITY FOR ALL THE PARTNERS AND LEGISLATED THROUGH A SET OF RULES THAT ENHANCES ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CHANGES IN THE APPROACH OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IMPLY A SUBSTITUTION OF PUBLIC POLICIES AIMED AT BUILDING A NEW PRODUCTIVE AND SOCIAL FABRIC, WHICH WILL TURN INTO MONETARY POLICIES, HUMAN RESOURCES TRAINING AND MOBILIZATION, AND TIGHTER CONTROL ON SOCIAL DEMANDS. THESE POLICIES, HOWEVER, DO NOT REPRESENT A DE-BUREAUCRATIZATION OR A MORE HORIZONTAL PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, BUT RATHER A NEW BUREAUCRATIC REASON, WHERE THE EXISTING RULE OF LAW CONTRIBUTES TO A NEW GOVERNMENTALITY, WHERE THE MARKET PREVAILS ABOVE THE SOCIAL.
377	IN VIEW OF THE INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, WE EXAMINE THE RELEVANCE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT BY APPLYING BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING ON 37 VARIABLES ACROSS 60 COUNTRIES FROM 2000 TO 2006. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT TRUST IS A ROBUST AND POSITIVE DETERMINANT OF STOCK MARKET DEPTH AND LIQUIDITY, AND THAT TRUST IS THE MOST RELEVANT COMPONENT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN MARKET DEVELOPMENT. MACROECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE FORM OF INFLATIONARY CHANGES HAS A DAMPENING EFFECT ON TRUST IN THE TRADING OF STOCK. FURTHER, SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ITS COMPONENTS, PARTICULARLY TRUST, ARE MORE RELEVANT TO STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW, NON-ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (NON-OECD) AND ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CO-OPERATION (OIC) COUNTRIES THAT ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY LOWER FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. OUR RESULTS SEEK TO REINFORCE THE RELEVANCE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN COMPLEMENTING THE MUCH NEEDED REFORM OF STOCK MARKETS GLOBALLY. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
378	THE CENTRAL CONCERN OF THIS PAPER IS TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION: WHY DO FDI INFLOWS GO WHERE THEY DO IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES? AN UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH FACTORS WILL ASSIST AFRICAN POLICYMAKERS TO FORMULATE AND EXECUTE POLICIES FOR ATTRACTING FDI. OUR ESTIMATION RESULTS FROM CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSIONS FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2008 INDICATE THAT: (I) THERE IS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARKET SIZE AND FDI INFLOWS; (II) OPENNESS TO TRADE HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON FDI FLOWS; (III) HIGHER FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT HAS NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FDI INFLOWS; (IV) THE PREVALENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW INCREASES FDI INFLOWS; (V) HIGHER FDI GOES WHERE FOREIGN AID ALSO GOES; (VI) AGGLOMERATION HAS A STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT ON FDI INFLOWS; (VI) NATURAL RESOURCE ENDOWMENT AND EXPLOITATION (SUCH AS OIL) ATTRACTS HUGE FDI; (VII) EAST AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUB-REGIONS APPEAR POSITIVELY DISPOSED TO OBTAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF INWARD FDI. THE KEY POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
379	MEDIEVAL IRISH POETS MUST HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE LORE OF PROMINENT PLACES (DINDSENCHAS). SEVERAL SOURCES FROM THE 11TH TO THE 13TH CENTURIES INCLUDE SHORT PASSAGES, IN BOTH PROSE AND POETRY, WHICH TELL OF THE "TRADITION" OF PLACES. EACH TOPONYM IS THUS EXPLAINED THROUGH A PARTICULAR STORY, WHICH IS OFTEN FAR FROM HISTORICAL REALITY, BUT WHICH RECOUNTS THE EXPLOITS OF A HERO, A KING OR A GOD. AMONG THESE LEGENDS, THERE ARE, HERE AND THERE, ALLUSIONS TO THE LAW. THIS STUDY LOOKS AT RECENSION C OF THE DINDSENCHAS, WHICH IS IN A MANUSCRIPT AT THE LIBRARY OF RENNES. IT CONTAINS REFERENCES TO CONTRACTS, SURETIES, ORDEALS AND JUDGMENTS, WHICH SHOW THAT THE LAW WAS NOT CONFINED TO LEGAL TREATISES, BUT WAS OFTEN INCORPORATED INTO VARIOUS LITERARY FORMS, PARTICULARLY THE LEGENDS OF PROMINENT PLACES. THE LEGENDS THEREFORE OFTEN CONFIRMED THE RULE OF LAW TAUGHT IN LAW SCHOOLS, THEY WERE THE SPIRIT OF THE CUSTOM.
380	DOCUMENTING THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF STRUCTURAL POLICIES ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE HAS GENERATED TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE DEVELOPMENT LITERATURE. IN CONTRAST, CONTEMPORARY EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL POLICIES ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH. STRUCTURAL POLICIES SELDOM CHANGE SUFFICIENTLY IN THE SHORT RUN, AND ACCEPTED INSTRUMENTS TO CONTROL FOR ENDOGENEITY IN CROSS SECTIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS. IN THIS PAPER WE UTILIZE AN ELEVEN YEAR PANEL OF 26 TRANSITION COUNTRIES TO IDENTIFY SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL POLICIES THAT ARE LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT A TEN PERCENT CHANGE IN THE QUALITY OF STRUCTURAL POLICIES (OR THE RULE OF LAW) TOWARDS OECD STANDARDS IS SHOWN TO RAISE ANNUAL GROWTH BY ABOUT 2.5%. TO CONTROL FOR ENDOGENEITY, WE DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENT USING THE HIERARCHY OF INSTITUTIONS HYPOTHESIS AND FIND THAT IT HOLDS A ROBUST EXPLANATORY POWER. WE ALSO DOCUMENT THAT EARLY REFORMERS REAP THE GREATEST BENEFITS, BUT THAT IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO BEGIN STRUCTURAL POLICY REFORMS. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
381	THIS PAPER PRESENTS A WEIGHTED SCORING MODEL AS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN POSTCONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS IN TWO DISTINCT ENVIRONMENTS: ADVERSARIAL AND NONADVERSARIAL. THE MODEL IS INTENDED TO AID DECISION MAKERS IN PRIORITIZING, PLANNING, AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR POSTCONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS. WEIGHTED SCORING IS USED TO CONDUCT VALUE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE MIX OF RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN A FIXED BUDGET PORTFOLIO TO EITHER MAXIMIZE OVERALL VALUE OR TO STEER SUPPORT TOWARD A DESIRED COMBINATION OF CORE OUTCOMES. THE UTILITY OF THE MODEL LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO USE THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY EFFECTIVELY IN ANY POSTCONFLICT ENVIRONMENT TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS AND A STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING APPROACH. WHILE THE EVALUATION MEASURES OR METRICS MAY CHANGE IN EACH ENVIRONMENT, THE CORE OUTCOMES AND THE CENTRAL TASKS WHICH SUPPORT THOSE OUTCOMES HOLD REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF POSTCONFLICT ENVIRONMENT. THESE CORE OUTCOMES OF SECURITY, GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, ECONOMICS, AND SOCIAL WELLBEING, IF ACHIEVED, CONSTITUTE SUCCESS IN POSTCONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS.
382	THE FAIRNESS THEORY OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION HOLDS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE PUBLIC GOODS PRODUCED BY THE COOPERATIVE EFFORTS OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS HAVE A PRIMA FACIE OBLIGATION TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE IN RETURN BY OBEYING THE LAW. HOWEVER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PUBLIC BENEFITS CROSS BORDERS? IN AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD, HAVE POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS BEGUN TO EXTEND ACROSS BORDERS? ACCORDING TO SOME CRITICS, FAIRNESS THEORY LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CITIZENS WHO RECEIVE BENEFITS ACROSS BORDERS ACQUIRE POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS TO OBEY FOREIGN STATES. IN RESPONSE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT FAIRNESS THEORISTS AND THEIR CRITICS HAVE CONFUSED TRANSNATIONAL MORAL OBLIGATIONS BASED ON FAIRNESS WITH POLITICAL OBLIGATIONS, WHICH STILL LARGELY COINCIDE WITH THE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES OF STATES. THERE ARE TWO KEY STEPS IN THIS ARGUMENT: REFORMULATING THE FAIRNESS THEORY OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION SO THAT IT FOCUSES ON THE DISTINCTIVE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE RULE OF LAW; DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FAIRNESS AS A BASIS OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION AND FAIRNESS AS A REQUIREMENT OF JUSTICE.
383	PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CONFRONT A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETING CONSTITUTIONAL THEORIES, WHICH OFFER CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF HOW JUDGES SHOULD INTERPRET AND APPLY THE CONSTITUTION. ASSESSMENT OF SUCH THEORIES NEEDS TO BE BASED PARTLY ON NORMATIVE GROUNDS. MOREOVER, THERE IS A SURPRISING DEGREE OF IMPLICIT AGREEMENT AMONG CONSTITUTIONAL THEORISTS ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY OUGHT TO SATISFY. BESIDES "FITTING" EITHER THE TEXT OF THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION OR SURROUNDING CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE, CONSTITUTIONAL THEORIES SHOULD BE JUDGED BASED ON THEIR CAPACITY TO (I) MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW (II) PRESERVE FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL DEMOCRACY, AND (III) PROTECT A MORALLY AND POLITICALLY ACCEPTABLE SET OF SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS. DETERMINING WHICH CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY WOULD BEST PROMOTE THESE GOALS REQUIRES A PARTLY INSTRUMENTAL CALCULATION, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF WHO OUR JUDGES AND JUSTICES ARE LIKELY TO BE. NONETHELESS, THE NEED TO SELECT A THEORY ON INSTRUMENTAL GROUNDS DOES NOT JUSTIFY UNPRINCIPLED, CASE-BY-CASE MANIPULATION. A GOOD CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY SHOULD IMPOSE CONSTRAINTS ON THOSE WHO ACCEPT IT.
384	THE OBJECT OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW INVOLVES THE REALIZATION OF GENDER EQUALITY, AS A WAY TO REACH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PROTECTIVE SYSTEM AGAINST VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AS A SOCIAL, HISTORICAL, STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN BRAZIL , SHOWING THAT THESE AGGRESSIONS WERE ACCENTUATED BY THE PANDEMIC CONTEXT THAT WE ARE FACING. THE ANALYSIS STARTS FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORM, WHICH ESTABLISHES THIS EQUALITY, AS WELL AS FROM THE MARIA DA PENHA LAW, WHICH ESTABLISHES THE PROTECTIVE SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVE SHOWS A HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF THIS PROCESS, FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, AS SUBSTRATE FOR THE NEW PARADIGM OF FACING THE PROBLEM, ARRIVING AT THE LEGISLATIVE PRODUCTION THAT SUCCEEDED AND SUBSTANTIATED IT. THE METHOD APPLIED REFERS TO LEGAL AND DOCTRINAL REVIEW AND ANALYSIS. AS A PARTIAL RESULT, THE ADOPTION OF PERMANENT PUBLIC POLICIES OF THE STATE IS PROPOSED TO ACT, SOCIALLY, IN THE CONSTITUTIVE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE.
385	WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES AND EFFECTS ON THE VALUES, DIGNITY, AND SELF-ESTEEM OF THE INNOCENT AND THEIR BELOVED ONES. WHILE VIETNAM IS IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, RECENT AND SERIOUS WRONGFUL CONVICTION CASES SUGGEST A NEED TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CREDIBILITY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. USING SEVERAL CASES FOR EXAMPLES FROM VIETNAM, THIS STUDY EXAMINES TWO LEVELS OF FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS: (I) THE ACKNOWLEDGED CAUSES (THE TOP OF THE ICEBERG) AND (II) THE HIDDEN ROOTS (BENEATH THE SURFACE). IN ADDITION, WE COMPARE THE CASE OF VIETNAM TO THE FINDINGS FROM OTHER ASIAN NATIONS, NOTABLY THOSE OF EAST ASIA. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CAUSES FOR WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AND CULTURE, AND ERADICATION OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING AND INNOVATIVE REFORMS THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS. RELEVANT POLICY AND PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OFFERED TO DEAL WITH THE FACTORS LEADING TO WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS IN VIETNAM.
386	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LAW AND LEGAL MECHANISMS IN EGYPT HAVE NOT SIMPLY REINFORCED AUTHORITARIANISM BUT HAVE ALSO BEEN THE AVENUE THROUGH WHICH EMBRYONIC MOVES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN HALTED AND EVEN REVERSED. THE POLITICAL REGIME HAS UTILIZED LAW TO CONSOLIDATE ITS RULE, BOOST ITS LEGITIMACY, CRACK DOWN ON OPPOSITION AND DISSENT, AND RESTRICT FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS. IN EGYPT, LAW AND AUTHORITARIANISM HAVE NOT ONLY CO-EXISTED BUT ALSO HAVE INTERSECTED AND BEEN MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE. THE POLITICAL REGIME HAS USED LAWS TO LEGALIZE ITS AUTOCRATIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS A PRETEXT TO RESTORE ORDER AND STABILITY AND FIGHT TERRORISM. SINCE 2013, THE LAW HAS BEEN A TOOL NOT SIMPLY FOR AUTHORITARIANISM IN GENERAL BUT ALSO FOR THE RULING REGIME AND MILITARY INSTITUTION TO ASSERT CONTROL OVER SOCIETY, TO PLACE THEMSELVES OUT OF REACH OF LEGAL/CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS AND ACCOUNTABILITY EITHER BY ISSUING NEW LAWS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS OR ALTERING EXISTING ONES.
387	THE RISE OF POPULISM REPRESENTS A THREAT TO CONSTITUTIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. POPULIST GOVERNMENTS ARE A THREAT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER AND TO THE AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AGREEMENTS. THIS ARTICLE WILL, THEREFORE, LOOK AT THE SERIOUS THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT IS PRESENTED BY POPULISM. THIS FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, MULTILATERALISM, AND THE FUNDING RECEIVED BY NGOS NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS (NGOS) IS BASED ON THE PROMOTION BY POPULIST GOVERNMENTS THAT THE EDICTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE MERELY A MATTER OF COORDINATION AND INTERVENTIONISM. POPULISTS AND POPULIST GOVERNMENTS TRADITIONALLY PROMOTE THIS IDEAL THROUGH THEIR POLICIES, WHICH ARE ANTI-PLURALIST AND ARE FOCUSED ON A LIMITED SET OF AGENDA-SETTING GOALS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERNATIONAL GOAL-SETTING OF PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, ALONG WITH THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN NATIONS FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THIS ARTICLE WILL ASCERTAIN THE VERY REAL THREAT THAT IS POSED BY THE CONTINUED RISE OF POPULISM AND, IN PARTICULAR, A POPULIST GOVERNMENT.
388	SCHOLARSHIP ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS OSCILLATED BETWEEN THE PEDAGOGICAL VALUE OF MORAL MAGNANIMITY, SHOWN BY VICTIMS OF PAST ATROCITIES WHO CHOOSE TO FORGIVE THEIR WRONGDOERS, AND THE DETERRENT EFFECT OF IMPOSING PUNISHMENT ON THE OFFENDERS, WHICH INCLUDES MAKING RESTITUTION TO THE VICTIMS OF THEIR WRONGFUL ACTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE VIEWS OF TWO AFRICAN THINKERS ON THIS ISSUE, ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU WHO ARGUES FOR FORGIVENESS, AND WOLE SOYINKA WHO DEFENDS RESTITUTION AS A BETTER WAY TO EXPRESS RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF BOTH THE VICTIMS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT WHILE TRADITIONAL AFRICAN VALUES PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN THE PERSPECTIVES OF THESE THINKERS, THEY DO NOT, IN THEMSELVES, JUSTIFY EITHER OF THE TWO POSITIONS THEY ADVANCE. THE ARTICLE FURTHER CONTRASTS THE POSITIVE ROLE TUTU AND SOYINKA ASSIGN TO HISTORICAL MEMORY AND TRUTH-TELLING WITH THE STRATEGIES OF SOCIAL FORGETTING AND PUBLIC SILENCE EMBRACED IN SIERRA LEONE AND MOZAMBIQUE IN THEIR QUEST FOR POLITICAL RECONCILIATION.
389	IN RUSSIAN LAW, THE TERM "GOOD FAITH" ("GOOD CONSCIENCE") REFERS TO DIFFERENT CONCEPTS: "HONEST PRACTICE" AND "IGNORANCE OF THE FACT WHEN SUCH IGNORANCE GENERATES LEGAL CONSEQUENCES." THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATE THE EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS OF DISTINGUISHING OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE GOOD FAITH. THE QUESTIONS OF APPLICATION OF THE RULES ON SUBJECTIVE GOOD FAITH TO THE RELATIONS ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT, CIRCULATION AND PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ARE CONSIDERED. THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTENT OF THE LEGAL REGIME OF OBJECTS OF ABSOLUTE PROPERTY RIGHTS (THINGS, PROPERTY SECURITY, SHARE IN THE RIGHT OF COMMON PROPERTY, CORPORATE RIGHTS) ALLOWED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THE RULES ON SUBJECTIVE GOOD FAITH IS A NATURAL, NECESSARY ELEMENT OF THE LEGAL REGIME OF ANY OBJECT OF CIVIL TURNOVER, AND THE REAL QUESTION IS ONLY THE RECOGNITION OF SUCH AN ELEMENT OF THE LEGAL REGIME BY THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEFINITION OF THE FEATURES OF ITS APPLICATION.
390	CURRENTLY, AT LEAST THREE APPROACHES TO JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE COEXIST IN THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT: THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MODEL, THE COURTS SERVICE MODEL, AND THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE MODEL. ALTHOUGH DOCTRINAL AND CASE-SPECIFIC LITERATURES ABOUND ON THIS TOPIC, EXAMPLES OF CROSS-COUNTRY STUDIES EXPLAINING CHOICES ON THESE MODELS OF JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE ARE RATHER SCARCE. MORE PARTICULARLY, WE LACK SO FAR KNOWLEDGE ON HOW DIFFERENT FACTORS INTERACT IN LEADING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MODEL. THIS IS STRIKING, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL COUNCILS FOR THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, EXPLANATIONS ON THE CHOICES OF MODELS OF JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE ARE ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE INTRICATE ISSUE OF THE POLITICAL RATIONALITIES UNDERLYING MACROLEVEL DESIGN OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. USING QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND FOCUSING ON EUROPEAN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE IN THE FIELD. IT IS SHOWN THAT JUDICIAL COUNCILS ARE CREATED WHEN POSTAUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES IMPLEMENT NEW CONSTITUTIONS EITHER IN ROMANISTIC LAW COUNTRIES OR IN COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO EUROPEANIZING PRESSURES.
391	OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPORT OF CERTAIN UNIVERSAL NORMS, RULES AND PRACTICES TO OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ACADEMIC CIRCLES, THE CONCEPT IS CALLED "NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE". DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, STRONG COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE: THESE PRINCIPLES FORM THE CORE IDENTITY OF THE EU. BASED ON SHARED POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL TIES AMONG MEMBER STATES, THE EU HAS SOUGHT TO PROMOTE THESE NORMS ALSO IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, INCLUDING RUSSIA. HOWEVER, THE OUTBREAK OF THE VIOLENT CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE AT THE END OF 2013 CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EU HAS FAILED IN ITS PURSUIT IN RUSSIA DESPITE EXTENSIVE MUTUAL RELATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE EU. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE HOW CONSISTENT HAS THE EU BEEN IN DEFENDING AND PROMOTING EUROPEAN VALUES AND NORMS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND TO RUSSIA DURING THE UKRAINIAN CONFLICT.
392	THERE IS NO SPACE LAW IN CHINA MEANING THE LAW IS DISPROPORTIONALLY UNDER-DEVELOPED IN COMPARISON WITH CHINA'S SPACE CAPABILITIES AND LEGISLATION IN OTHER NATIONS. A MIXTURE OF HISTORICAL, POLITICAL, LEGAL, AND BUREAUCRATIC REASONS ACCOUNTS FOR THIS ABSENCE. SPACE LAW WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE 5-YEAR LEGISLATION PLAN OF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IN 2013. THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CONSENSUS ON THE NECESSITY AND IMPORTANCE OF THE ENACTMENT OF A SPACE LAW BECAUSE OF THE NEW EMPHASIS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INCREASING NEED TO IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, AND TO REGULATE ACTIVITIES AND INVESTMENT CONDUCTED BY UNCONVENTIONAL ACTORS. THE LEGISLATION MODEL AND ITS MAIN REGULATORY REGIMES HAVE BECOME CLEAR AFTER YEARS OF DISCUSSION, AND THE MAJOR CONTROVERSY OF THIS LAW IS WHETHER AND HOW TO REGULATE THE MILITARY PARTICIPATION IN SPACE ACTIVITIES AND STREAMLINE THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, TO WHICH THE RECENT MILITARY REFORMATION COULD PROVIDE SOME CLUES.

393	THIS IS THE FIRST ARTICLE IN A TWO-PART SERIES THAT ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING LAW AS IT AFFECTS THE RIGHTS TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS. SUCH LAWS INCLUDE THOSE WHICH PERMIT THE DETENTION AND USE OF RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES FOR CHALLENGING BEHAVIOURS' OR BEHAVIOURS OF CONCERN'. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY EXAMINING THE NATURE OF RIGHTS AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE OF LIBERTY AND SECURITY. BOTH ARE RECOGNISED NOT ONLY AS HUMAN RIGHTS BUT ALSO AS COMMON LAW RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE THEN DEVELOPS A RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH TO LAW THAT PROTECTS THESE RIGHTS. TAKING A THIN' VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS THE STARTING POINT, THE APPROACH EXPANDS THIS BY ADDING A REQUIREMENT TO RESPECT NOT ONLY COMMON LAW RIGHTS BUT HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RIGHTS-BASED APPROACH THEN ARGUES FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE REQUIRING THE PRIORITISATION OF RIGHTS OVER OTHER POLICY IMPERATIVES AND A COMMITMENT TO EQUAL CONCERN AND RESPECT.
394	THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE DEEPER SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC REASONS BEHIND THE BRITISH CHOICE OF LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE ADDRESS THE DETAILED RESULTS OF THE REFERENDUM AND THE LONG-STANDING SCEPTICAL BRITISH ATTITUDE TOWARDS EUROPEAN INTEGRATION; NEXT, WE ANALYSE THE NET BUDGETARY CONTRIBUTION THAT CHANGED ENORMOUSLY AFTER THE EASTERN ENLARGEMENT. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE RISE IN THE IMMIGRANTNATIVE RATIO HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EMPLOYEE'S PAY LEVEL IN CERTAIN AREAS, THEREFORE PRO-BREXIT CAMPAIGNERS HIGHLIGHTED MIGRATION AS ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS ARISING FROM EU MEMBERSHIP. INCREASING INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITIES AND A GROWING ANTI-ELITE SENTIMENT IN BRITISH SOCIETY, COUPLED WITH THE NEGATIVE IMAGE OF BRUSSELS BUREAUCRATS AND A BRITISH APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTINENTAL ONE, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE FINAL RESULT OF THE REFERENDUM. OUR ANALYSIS ENDS WITH A GLIMPSE INTO THE CLOSE FUTURE, EMPHASISING THAT THE FUTURE OF BRITISH-EU RELATIONS DEPENDS WHOLLY ON THE PRAGMATISM AND WISDOM OF THE NEGOTIATING PARTIES.
395	IN RECENT YEARS MANY ACADEMICS, SOCIAL ACTIVISTS AND NGOS HAVE TURNED TO INTERNATIONAL BODIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR HARMFUL AND ILLEGAL ACTS. SIGNIFICANT AMONGST THESE IS THE UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON ISSUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS. IN 2008, FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND CONSULTATION WITH STATES, CORPORATIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS, THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE RELEASED A SERIES OF GUIDELINES OUTLINING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF STATES AND CORPORATIONS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, AND OF BOTH TO ENSURE ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL AND NON-JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR VICTIMS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE UN GUIDELINES FAIL TO RECOGNIZE OR INCORPORATE THE EMPIRICALLY AND HISTORICALLY DEMONSTRATED IMPERATIVES THAT GUIDE TRANSNATIONAL GLOBAL CAPITALISM. WHILE GLOBAL CAPITALISM IS COMPLEX AND RIFE WITH CONTRADICTIONS, ITS RAISON D'ETRE IS ROOTED IN PROFIT MAXIMIZATION. THE PAPER SETS OUT ALTERNATIVE PROVISIONS WITH, WE ARGUE, GREATER POTENTIAL TO SUBJECT GLOBAL CAPITAL TO THE RULE OF LAW.
396	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE ON LEGAL THINKING BY STUDYING THE CASE OF GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TRACING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AT THE CORE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW MOVEMENT TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF LEGAL LANDSCAPE, I SUGGEST THAT GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, SUPPORTED BY THE UNDERLYING VALUES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, REFLECTS A DELIBERATELY CHOSEN APPROACH TO THE NEW NOMOS OF THE EARTH IN THE GLOBAL ERA. DISTANCED FROM THE WILL OF NATION-STATES, THE LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY OF GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE RECONSTRUCTED AROUND THE IDEA OF PUBLICNESS, SUGGESTING A NEW PARADIGM OF LAW BASED ON INTER-PUBLIC LEGALITY. I ARGUE THAT UNDER THIS NEW PARADIGM OF LAW, POLITICAL CALCULATION DISPLACES LEGAL REASONING. LEGALITY AMOUNTS TO THE DISPENSATION OF LEGAL WEIGHT AND IS THUS MERGED WITH POLITICS. GIVEN THE NON-PUBLIC, INTEREST-ORIENTED CHARACTER OF DIALOGUES IN THE POLITICS OF WEIGHTING, HOWEVER, GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SUGGESTS A POST-PUBLIC CONCEPTION OF LEGITIMACY.
397	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO PROVING A HYPOTHESIS THAT THE SPECIFICITY OF THE MODERN RUSSIAN STATE IS BEST REFLECTED IN THE METAPHOR OF PALACE EMPLOYED BY V.O. KLYUCHEVSKY FOR CHARACTERIZING THE RUSSIAN STATE THAT WAS FORMED AFTER PETER I'S DEATH. ACCORDING TO I. GLEBOVA, A "PALACE" REPRESENTS A RATHER INDEPENDENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT EMERGED AS A RESPONSE TO NEW CONDITIONS AND OLD STATE TRADITIONS RATHER THAN DEVIATION FROM THE "RIGHT" STATE (THE SOVIET "NATIONWIDE" OR WESTERN RULE OF LAW) OR ITS PERVERSION/"WORSENING" THAT CAN BE IMPROVED IF SOMEONE IS WILLING TO DO SO. THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THIS ISSUE (FOR THE BEGINNING SEE POLITEIA, 2011, NO 2) DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MAIN STABILIZER OF THE "PALACE" ORDER IS A MASS POST-SOVIET HUMAN TYPE - A DIRECT AND THE CLOSEST INHERITOR OF THE SOVIET PERSON WITH HIS/ HER EXPERIENCE, VALUES AND NORMS, STRATEGIES OF SELF-DEFENSE AND SOCIAL PROMOTION, ILLUSIONS, COMPLEXES AND PHOBIAS.
398	WITH A VIEW TO ESTABLISHING THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE OCCURRENCE OF STATE CAPTURE AND DIFFERENT FORMS OF CORRUPTION AND THE FEASIBILITY OF THEIR MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION, IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE HISTORICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXT OF TIMOR-LESTE ARE EXAMINED. THIS CONTEXT IS FOUND TO BE CONDUCIVE TO VARIOUS FORMS OF STATE CAPTURE AND SYSTEMIC GRAND AND PETTY CORRUPTION, AND TO BE RESISTANT TO CONVENTIONAL SHORT-TERM TECHNOCRATIC ANTICORRUPTION REMEDIES. WHILE THE LATTER ARE LIKELY TO HAVE PUBLIC RELATIONS BENEFITS THAT MAY BE HELPFUL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF POLITICAL STABILITY IN THE SHORT RUN, IT IS ARGUED THAT SIGNIFICANT ANTICORRUPTION PROGRESS IS A LONG-TERM ENDEAVOUR, ACHIEVABLE PRINCIPALLY THROUGH: SUSTAINED IMPARTIAL SERVICE DELIVERY THAT UNDERMINES BELIEF'S IN PATRONAGE; HASTENING-THROUGH GENERAL EDUCATION AND THE CREATION OF A CONDUCIVE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT FOR BUSINESS-THE EMERGENCE OF LEADERS OF INTEGRITY AND THE GROWTH OF A MIDDLE CLASS; AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.

399	WHILE MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CREATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC), THUS FAR LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE INADEQUACY OF THE STATUTORY GUIDANCE GOVERNING, THE COURT'S SENTENCING REGIME. THIS NOTE WILL EXAMINE THE PHILOSOPHIES GUIDING THE PUNISHMENT OF WAR CRIMINALS IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT, AND WILL ARGUE THAT ONLY A RETRIBUTIVIST APPROACH TO SENTENCING WILL ACHIEVE THE IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT GOALS OF THE ICC: TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS OF WAR CRIMES AND TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW. A REVIEW OF SENTENCING JUDGMENTS HANDED DOWN BY THE ICCS MOST RECENT PREDECESSORS, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND RWANDA, REVEALS A SYSTEMATIC FAILURE TO TRANSLATE HARSH RETRIBUTIVE RHETORIC INTO ADEQUATE PRISON SENTENCES. THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE TRIBUNALS INDICATES THAT FOR THE ICC TO BRING NEW LEGITIMACY TO INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW, IT MUST ADOPT MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT WAR CRIMINALS RECEIVE CERTAIN MINIMAL PUNISHMENTS AND SERVE OUT THEIR FILL SENTENCES.
400	THE EXISTING LITERATURE IS FILLED WITH MIXED FINDINGS ON THE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN PARTICULAR, PREVIOUS LITERATURE TREATS THE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN ISOLATION, WHILE WE EMPHASIZE THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, AND ESPECIALLY, ECONOMIC FREEDOM. USING DATA FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR, WE RE-EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND GROWTH AND ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY THE MIXED FINDINGS. THE SYSTEMIC LINK BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS INVESTIGATED BY EXAMINING A PANEL OF 54 COUNTRIES (2008-2018). THE RESULTS VALIDATE THAT OVERALL ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ITS SUBCOMPONENTS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, LIMITED GOVERNMENT SIZE, REGULATORY EFFICIENCY AND MARKET OPENNESS PROMOTE THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM NOT ONLY DIRECTS INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS TO ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY, BUT ALSO AFFECTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY ENCOURAGES HIGHER GROWTH RATES. THE FINDINGS CONTRADICT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT SOME MEASURES OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
401	THIS NOTE EXPLORES THE HOLDING, CONTEXT AND AFTERMATH OF THE JUDGMENTS WHICH DECLARED THE SO-CALLED MODIFIED LETTER TURNED COMMAIMMIGRATION EXCEPTION' SET OUT IN THE UK DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018 INCOMPATIBLE WITH, AND ASSUMED IT SUBJECT TO, THE (UK) GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR) RESTRICTIONS CLAUSE (ARTICLE 23). THE SUBSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THIS EXEMPTION'S USE TO THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPACTFUL IN ITSELF. HOWEVER, THIS CASE HAS MUCH WIDER SIGNIFICANCE. FIRSTLY, THE FINDING THAT THE RESTRICTIONS CLAUSE MANDATES GRANULAR SPECIFICITY PLACES IN JEOPARDY MANY EXEMPTIONS NOT ONLY IN THE UK BUT ALSO IN EU STATES. SECONDLY, THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS ARTICLE WAS ENGAGED IS QUESTIONABLE SINCE, AS REWORDED POST-BREXIT, IT IS RESTRICTED TO LIMITATIONS LAID DOWN IN DELEGATED LEGISLATION. NEVERTHELESS, THIS REWORDING DEPENDED ON POWERS LIMITED TO ADDRESSING POST-BREXIT TECHNICAL MODIFIED LETTER TURNED COMMADEFICIENCIES' AND SO IS ULTRA VIRES. THE COURT OF APPEAL SHOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THIS IN ORDER TO VINDICATE THE RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS.
402	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR THE BRAZILIAN STATE TO ACT ON THE INTERNALIZATION OF THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF PESTICIDES IN AGRICULTURE. THUS, THE RESEARCH PROBLEM IS: WHY DOES THE INTERNALIZATION OF NEGATIVE PESTICIDE EXTERNALITIES BE IMPORTANT FOR AN AGRICULTURAL POLICY THAT RESPECTS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS?. AS A METHODOLOGICAL STRATEGY, INITIALLY, IT IDENTIFIES SOME BRAZILIANS AND INTERNATIONAL POLICIES THAT SUPPORTED THE GREEN REVOLUTION. IT WAS THE GREEN REVOLUTION THAT DISSEMINATED AGRIBUSINESS AND INTENSIVE PESTICIDE USE. THE SECOND STEP INVESTIGATES THE NEGATIVE PESTICIDE EXTERNALITIES IN AGRICULTURE, FOOD, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE SHOWS SOME POLICIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED BY BRAZIL TO INTERNALIZATION THE NEGATIVES PESTICIDES EFFECTS. PESTICIDES VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS, SO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW MUST ACT TO REDUCE OR END THEM. IT PROPOSES SOME ACTIONS TO FACE THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF PESTICIDES. IT CONCLUDES THAT, AS THE PESTICIDES HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING BY STATE, ITS DISCOURAGEMENT MUST BE THE OBJECT OF EFFECTIVE PUBLIC POLICIES
403	THIS STUDY SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS AND REGULATORY SETTINGS ON THE PROFITABILITY OF ISLAMIC BANKS OPERATING IN THE ARAB MARKETS FROM 2003 TO 2017. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS UNDERSCORE THAT THE EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISM AND ITS DIMENSIONS IN PARTICULAR THE POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION IMPACT ISLAMIC BANKS' PROFITABILITY POSITIVELY. HOWEVER, THE REGULATORY SETTINGS AND ITS SUB-INDICES PARTICULARLY THE EXTENT OF DISCLOSURE AND EASE OF SHAREHOLDER SUITS HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. LIKEWISE, THE RESULTS OF TRADITIONAL DETERMINANTS INDICATE THAT THE PROFITABILITY OF ISLAMIC BANKS IS SHAPED BY THE BANK-SPECIFIC, INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC, AND COUNTRY AND GLOBAL-LEVEL DETERMINANTS. RESULTS ARE ROBUST AND CONSISTENT WITH ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATION PROCEDURES AND ALSO SUPPORT FOR THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE EFFECT OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY EXTERNAL GOVERNANCE'S DIMENSION AND INFLATION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY HAVE IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR REGULATORS, POLICYMAKERS, AND BANKS' MANAGERS.
404	COMMUNITARIANISM IS ONE OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL CURRENTS WITH THE GREATEST PRESENCE IN THE CURRENT ACADEMIC DEBATE, OPPOSING THE PREMISES OF LIBERALISM. THUS, COMMUNITARIANISM DEFENDS THE PREEMINENCE OF THE ETHICAL VALUES EXISTING IN COMMUNITIES AND THE IDEA OF MEMBERSHIP OVER THE NOTIONS OF RIGHTS AND JUSTICE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INFLUENCE OF COMMUNITARIAN PHILOSOPHY ON CRIMINAL LAW BY STUDYING THE CONFIGURATION OF A CRIMINAL LAW ARTICULATED ON THE DEFENSE OF COMMUNITARIAN ETHICAL VALUES. THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY ANALYZING THE COMMUNITARIANISM-LIBERALISM BINOMIAL. IT ALSO STUDIES THE POSITION OF THE DOCTRINE IN RELATION TO LIBERAL NEUTRALITY AND THE POSITIONS CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF AN ETHICAL MINIMUM. THE ESSAY ARGUES THAT CRIMINAL LAW SHOULD BE NEUTRAL WITHOUT REFLECTING THE DOMINANT VALUES OF A GIVEN COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF COMMUNITARIAN CRIMINAL LAW (THE CRIMINAL LAW OF THE ENEMY, THE CRIMINAL LAW OF APOROPHOBIA, AND POLITICAL CRIMES) ARE ANALYZED. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH THEIR INADMISSIBILITY IN THE FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC STATES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
405	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS AN APPROACH TO PEACE THROUGH A STRENGTHENING OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING A RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS AND THE PROMOTION OF TRUST IN LEGAL MECHANISMS, TO DEAL WITH LEGACIES OF VIOLENCE AND REPRESSION. A MAIN CRITIQUE OF THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE APPROACH IS THAT IT LEAVES UNTOUCHED THE INJUSTICES UNDERLYING CONFLICT AND THE STRUCTURAL CAUSES OF ABUSE. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE IN TURKEY APPLIED A TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE APPROACH TO THE KURDISH ISSUE, FOCUSING ON HOW IT HANDLED THE LEGACY OF FORCED MIGRATION AND VILLAGE EVACUATIONS FROM THE 1990S. THESE STATE REMEDIES TO DEAL WITH FORCED MIGRATION IGNORED POLITICAL DIMENSIONS AND CONTINUED INJUSTICES. AGAINST THIS CONTEXT, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CONCEPT OF SELF-ADMINISTRATION AS IT EMERGED IN THE COURSE OF THE STRUGGLE OF THE KURDISH MOVEMENT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A FORM OF DO-IT-YOURSELF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
406	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FACTORS UNDERLYING THE POLITICAL POSITIONING OF LAWYERS IN HONG KONG. IT RESPONDS TO CONTEMPORARY DEBATES ON THE SOCIOLOGY OF PROFESSIONS BY ARGUING THAT THE 'PROFESSIONAL PROJECT' - WHICH SEES SOCIAL STATUS AND MARKET MONOPOLY AS THE PROFESSION'S PRIMARY GOALS - CANNOT FULLY EXPLAIN LAWYERS' POLITICAL BEHAVIOUR UNDER STATE SOCIETY DYNAMICS. HONG KONG'S CASE IS PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE. ETHNICALLY CHINESE, YET PRACTISING BRITISH COMMON LAW, HONG KONG SAW ITS SOVEREIGNTY SHIFT FROM BRITAIN TO CHINA ON 1 JULY 1997. THE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS TWO BRANCHES OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS - HAS SINCE BECOME MORE APPARENT. WITH REFERENCE TO CAUSE LAWYERING, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLES OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, THE NATURE OF THE LAWYER CLIENT RELATIONSHIP AND LEGAL EDUCATION IN SHAPING THE POLITICAL ORIENTATION OF LAWYERS. IT OFFERS INSIGHT INTO HOW HONG KONG'S LEGAL PROFESSION MUST CONSTANTLY NEGOTIATE WITH A REGIME THAT HAS NOT TRADITIONALLY CHAMPIONED THE RULE OF LAW. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
407	ONE OF THE DEFINING MOMENTS IN KENYA'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE WAS THE DEFEAT OF KANU, THE PARTY THAT HAD BEEN IN POWER SINCE THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE IN 1963, BY THE NATIONAL RAINBOW COALITION, NARC IN 2002. THE VICTORY WAS HAILED AS A NEW DAWN THAT WOULD ENTRENCH GOOD GOVERNANCE, EQUITY, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. AFTER ALL, THE VICTORY WAS A CULMINATION OF MANY YEARS OF AGITATION AGAINST KANU DICTATORSHIP. FURTHERMORE, NARC WAS A MASS MOVEMENT WITH NATIONAL APPEAL AND LED BY RENOWNED ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT POLITICIANS, CIVIL SOCIETY, AND ACTIVIST INTELLECTUALS AND CLERGY. BUT, THESE ASPIRATIONS WOULD BE BETRAYED BY FRAGMENTATION OF ELITES IN NARC AND RE-INVENTION OF CORRUPTION BY THE SAME ELITES. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE NARC COLLAPSE TO THE COUNTRY'S POST-MOI DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS, MORE SO THE DIMINISHED ROLE OF INTELLECTUALS IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE. THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE URGENT NEED FOR ORGANIC INTELLECTUALS AND THE WAY FORWARD.
408	THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION BRINGS A PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION TO THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE IN CANDIDATE COUNTRIES, CREATING NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR PREVIOUSLY MARGINALIZED ACTORS. STUDYING THE DIFFERENTIAL EMPOWERMENT OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) ACTIVE IN THE AREA OF RULE OF LAW DURING AND AFTER CROATIAN MEMBERSHIP NEGOTIATIONS, THIS CONTRIBUTION MAKES TWO RELATED CLAIMS: ON THE ONE HAND, CROATIAN NGOS SUCCEEDED IN STRENGTHENING THEIR POSITION DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF THE PRE-ACCESSION PERIOD BY ACTIVELY USING NEW EUROPEAN UNION [EU] RELATED OPPORTUNITIES. ON THE OTHER, AN OVERRELIANCE ON EU LEVERAGE POSED IMPORTANT TEMPORAL AND SUBSTANTIVE LIMITS ON NGO EMPOWERMENT AND LED TO A RAPID DECLINE OF THEIR RELEVANCE IN THE POST-ACCESSION PHASE. THESE FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTORS' STRATEGIC CHOICES FOR THE FUNCTIONING AND OUTCOME OF DIFFERENTIAL EMPOWERMENT, AND SUGGEST THAT BOTH THE EU AND CANDIDATE COUNTRY NGOS NEED TO PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON FOSTERING IMPROVED DOMESTIC PRACTICES OF CIVIL SOCIETY INCLUSION THROUGHOUT THE ACCESSION PROCESS.
409	SAMOA HAS A DISTINCTIVE REPUTATION IN THE PACIFIC FOR POLITICAL STABILITY. OVER THE LAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY, SAMOA HAS ENJOYED THE RULE OF LAW, CONSISTENCY IN POLICY-MAKING, AND LAW AND ORDER WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERTAKING CRITICAL SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM. BY WAY OF CONTRAST, OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION HAVE NOTABLY SUFFERED COUPS, VIOLENT CONFLICT, ECONOMIC DECLINE, AND BREAKDOWNS IN LAW AND ORDER. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO SAMOA'S STABILITY, IN PARTICULAR THE POLITICAL DOMINANCE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION PARTY (HRPP), WHICH HAS RULED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 1988. THE HRPP HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING THE LOYALTY OF MEMBERS; KEEPING THE OPPOSITION WEAK; MANAGING, AND ARGUABLY TURNING TO ITS ADVANTAGE, THE GOVERNMENT'S BALANCE OF POWER WITH TRADITIONAL INSTITUTIONS; AND EFFECTIVELY LIMITING THE ABILITY OF THE MEDIA TO INFORM THE PUBLIC. WHILE THE RULE OF THE HRPP HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO SAMOA'S POLITICAL STABILITY, THIS HAS, HOWEVER, COME AT A PRICE.
410	THIS ARTICLE HELPS EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN POLITICAL TURMOIL OBSERVED IN THE MENA DURING THE ARAB SPRING. THE REGION'S MONARCHIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY SPARED OF VIOLENCE WHILE THE "REPUBLICS" HAVE NOT. A THEORY ABOUT HOW A MONARCHY'S POLITICAL CULTURE SOLVES A RULER'S CREDIBLE COMMITMENT PROBLEM EXPLAINS WHY THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE. USING A PANEL DATASET OF THE MENA COUNTRIES (1950-2006), I SHOW THAT MONARCHS ARE LESS LIKELY THAN NONMONARCHS TO EXPERIENCE POLITICAL INSTABILITY, A RESULT THAT HOLDS ACROSS SEVERAL MEASURES. THEY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS AND GROW THEIR ECONOMIES. THROUGH THE USE OF AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE THAT PROXIES FOR A LEGACY OF TRIBALISM, THE TIME THAT HAS ELAPSED SINCE THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION WEIGHTED BY LAND QUALITY, I SHOW THAT THIS RESULT RUNS FROM MONARCHY TO POLITICAL STABILITY. THE RESULTS ARE ALSO ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL EXPLANATIONS AND COUNTRY FIXED EFFECTS.
411	AMONG THE AESTHETIC CATEGORIES THAT APPEARS ONLY OCCASIONALLY IN ARENDT'S REFLECTIONS ON LITERATURE AND CULTURE IS THAT OF TRAGEDY. SHE THUS DEPARTS FROM A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HER CONTEMPORARIES, INCLUDING HEIDEGGER, FOR WHOM THE IDEA OF THE TRAGIC IS OF CENTRAL, EVEN DECISIVE IMPORTANCE. BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT ARENDT ENGAGES WITH THE EPOCHAL CHARACTER OF GREEK TRAGEDY IN HER "TRIAL REPORT," EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM. THE REASON HER ENGAGEMENT HAS GONE LARGELY UNRECOGNIZED IS THAT IT OCCURS IN CONNECTION WITH HER APPROPRIATION OF THE THEME FROM A YOUNG SCHOLAR NAMED YOSAL ROGAT, WHO PUBLISHED A PAMPHLET IN 1961 ENTITLED THE EICHMANN TRIAL AND THE RULE OF LAW. ATTENTIVE TO ROGAT'S EARLIER WORK, THIS ESSAY SHOWS THAT THE THEORY OF TRAGEDY DEVELOPED BY BENJAMIN INFORMS THE PERPLEXING CONCLUSION OF ARENDT'S REPORT, WHERE SHE GIVES VOICE TO THE WORDS SHE BELIEVES THE JERUSALEM JUDGES SHOULD HAVE PRONOUNCED WITH THEIR VERDICT.
412	THE DISTRIBUTION OF ATTENTION ACROSS ISSUES IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND OUTPUTS OF GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ISSUE-BASED THEORY OF THE DIVERSITY OF GOVERNING AGENDAS WHERE THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT-DEFENSE, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, THE ECONOMY, GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS, AND THE RULE OF LAW-ARE PRIORITIZED AHEAD OF ALL OTHER ISSUES. IT UNDERTAKES COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ISSUE DIVERSITY OF THE EXECUTIVE AGENDA OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND THE UNITED STATES OVER THE POSTWAR PERIOD. THE RESULTS OFFER STRONG EVIDENCE OF THE LIMITING EFFECT OF CORE ISSUES-THE ECONOMY, GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS, DEFENSE, AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS-ON AGENDA DIVERSITY. THIS SUGGESTS NOT ONLY THAT SOME ISSUES RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION THAN OTHERS BUT ALSO THAT SOME ISSUES ARE ATTENDED TO ONLY AT TIMES WHEN THE AGENDA IS MORE DIVERSE. WHEN CORE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT ARE HIGH ON THE AGENDA, EXECUTIVES PURSUE A LESS DIVERSE AGENDA-FOCUSING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR ATTENTION ON FEWER ISSUES. SOME ISSUES ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS IN EXECUTIVE AGENDA SETTING.
413	IN DRC V FG HEMISPHERE BOTH THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY OPINIONS IN THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL TREATED INTERNATIONAL LAW AS IRRELEVANT FOR THE DECISION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN ON THE BASIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE ALONE. THIS WAS A MISTAKEN COURSE WITH POTENTIALLY VERY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG. THE MINORITY TREATED DECISIONS TAKEN ON SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY BY HK COURTS IN THE PAST AS FROZEN INTO PRECEDENTS IN COMMON LAW AND THEREFORE DERIVING THEIR STRENGTH ONLY FROM THE COMMON LAW OF HONG KONG. ON THE OTHER HAND THE MAJORITY EFFECTIVELY DECIDED THAT ANY ISSUE COMING BEFORE IT WHICH INVOLVES INTERNATIONAL LAW IS AUTOMATICALLY A MATTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THAT IT IS UP TO THE PRC TO TELL THE HK COURTS WHAT IS THE INTERPRETATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN FUTURE HK COURTS SHOULD TREAT THE LAW OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AS SUI GENERIS HAVING NO IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR APPROACH TO OTHER INTERNATIONAL LAW QUESTIONS.
414	THE RIGHT TO A COURT (RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL) IS REGARDED AS A FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. WITH REGARD TO LIABILITY FOR OFFENSES WHICH DO NOT BELONG TO THE SO-CALLED CORE OF CRIMINAL LAW, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS ACCEPTED THE ADJUDICATION ON THIS LIABILITY BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY. HOWEVER, THE REQUIREMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 6 (I) OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE FULL JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY'S DECISION(S). THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER AND HOW THE SOLUTIONS ADOPTED IN GERMAN, FRENCH AND ENGLISH LAW MEET THE STANDARDS IN RELATION TO ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY OF A PENAL CHARACTER. THIS STUDY WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE CHARACTER OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES' DECISIONS REGARDING SUCH LIABILITY AND THE SCOPE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SUCH ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS IN THE FIELD OF THE PROTECTION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND COMPETITION.
415	IN APRIL 2021, THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THROUGH ORDER NO. 79, HAS REVISED ITS MARITIME TRAFFIC LAWS (MARITIME TRAFFIC LAWS REVISION-2021), WHICH WAS THEN ENFORCED ON SEPTEMBER 1 2021. THE REVISED LAW CONTAINS TEN CHAPTERS AND 122 ARTICLES THAT COMPREHENSIVELY DEAL WITH MARITIME TRAFFIC SAFETY AND STRENGTHENS CHINA'S MARITIME TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. IT APPLIES IN THE WATERS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF CHINA, WHICH IS NOT LIMITED TO THE TERRITORIAL SEA, AND REGULATES CHINESE SHIPS AT SEA. SOME REVISED PROVISIONS PUT FORWARD NEW REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS PRE-NOTICE FOR FOREIGN VESSELS IN SOME SEA AREAS, WHICH BRINGS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL INFLUENCE. AS A STATE PRACTICE, THIS NEW REVISION CAN BE SEEN AS AN INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN AMBIGUOUS CONCEPTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN IMPROVING THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
416	IN 1948 THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION PUT INTO EFFECT THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITIZENS TO EXERCISE AND DEMAND THESE RIGHTS, THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO LARGE GROUPS: CIVIL AND POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TEXT IS TO ANALYZE THE LEVEL OF ENFORCEABILITY OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS AND PARTICULARLY, THE LEVEL OF REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION IN ECUADOR. FOR THIS, THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH METHOD WAS ADOPTED TO RECORD THE MAIN HISTORICAL MILESTONES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHTS IN GENERAL AND OF THE SECOND GROUP IN PARTICULAR. AS A RESULT, IT IS FOUND THAT ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ARE LESS ENFORCEABLE THAN CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT EACH COUNTRY HAS UNDERTAKEN LEGAL REFORMS THAT MAKE THEM ENFORCEABLE ACCORDING TO THE SCOPE OF THEIR RULE OF LAW AND THE POLITICAL CLASS THAT GOVERNS IN EACH PERIOD.
417	WITH THE INCREASING MOBILITY OF THE RURAL POPULATION IN CHINA AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF RESIDENTS MOVING TO THE CITIES FOR WORK OR STUDY, RURAL SOCIETY IS FORMING A PLURALISTIC, INTEREST-CENTERED, "OPEN" SOCIAL NETWORKS RELATIONS THAT FOLLOWS THE MODERN RULE OF LAW CONTRACT. BASED ON CHINESE GENERAL SOCIAL SURVEY (CGSS) DATA, THE RESULTS OF THE EMPIRICAL STUDY FINDS THAT SOCIAL INSURANCE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF RURAL RESIDENTS IN CHINA, THAT IS, FORMAL SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN RURAL AREAS PROMOTES INFORMAL SOCIAL SECURITY MECHANISMS SUCH AS SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE GROUPING TEST SHOW THAT RURAL RESIDENTS IN CHINA'S DIFFERENT REGIONS WERE AFFECTED BY SOCIAL INSURANCE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SOCIAL INSURANCE HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN THE EASTERN REGION THAN IN THE MIDDLE AND WESTERN REGIONS. THE PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING METHOD WAS USED TO REDUCE THE SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS, AND THE FINDINGS OF THE PAPER WERE FOUND TO BE ROBUST.
418	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS A COUNTERINTUITIVE DYNAMIC OF NEOLIBERAL GLOBALIZATION. INDIA HAS CONTROVERSIALLY LIBERALIZED FOREIGN INVESTMENT RULES IN THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE FOOD RETAIL SECTOR. CRITICS ARGUE THAT INDIA BOWED TO PRESSURE FROM MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, CONSISTENT WITH A COMMON VIEW THAT UNDER NEOLIBERALISM MARKETS ECLIPSE STATE POWER. WE SUGGEST BY CONTRAST THAT POLICYMAKERS SEEK MULTINATIONAL FIRMS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR CAPACITY TO GOVERN FOOD MARKETS THAT FOR CENTURIES HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY NETWORKS OF LOCAL TRADERS. THESE TRADERS USE INFORMAL CONVENTIONS OF MARKET GOVERNANCE THAT HAVE LONG PROVEN RESISTANT TO CENTRALIZED STATE CONTROL. GLOBAL RETAILERS PROMISE TO TRANSFORM THESE OPAQUE, "TRADITIONAL" SYSTEMS INTO TRANSPARENT, "MODERN," SUPPLY CHAINS THAT COMPLY WITH LIBERAL RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THUS WE ARGUE THE TURN TO MULTINATIONAL CAPITAL SHOULD NEITHER BE UNDERSTOOD SIMPLY THROUGH THE LOGICS OF STATE CAPTURE OR WELFARE ECONOMICS, BUT RATHER ALSO AS A POLITICAL GOVERNANCE PROJECT THAT ILLUSTRATES HOW DIFFERENT KINDS OF MARKETS PRODUCE DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE STATE.
419	THE EXISTING STUDIES ON INNOVATION EXTENSIVELY FOCUSED ON SUCH ECONOMIC FACTORS AS FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS, TRADE OPENNESS, AND R&D INVESTMENTS. CONTRASTINGLY, NON-ECONOMIC FACTORS HAVE RECEIVED LESS RESEARCH ATTENTION IN THE INNOVATION LITERATURE. LOUSY GOVERNANCE MAY LEAD TO POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INEFFECTIVENESS. WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION WEAKENS THE ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICES AND RULE OF LAW AND MAY CONSEQUENTLY HAMPER INNOVATION. SIMILARLY, TERRORISM DETERS FLOWS OF INVESTMENT, INCREASES UNPRODUCTIVE COSTS, CAUSES BRAIN DRAINS, DECREASES R&D INVESTMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES AND FINALLY INHIBITS RATES OF INNOVATION. THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACTS OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, TERRORISM, FDI INFLOWS, AND TRADE OPENNESS UPON INNOVATION IN A LAGGARD COUNTRY: PAKISTAN. THE FINDINGS VIA THE ARDL CO-INTEGRATION APPROACH SHOW THAT LOUSY GOVERNANCE, TERRORISM AND FDI INFLOWS HAVE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON INNOVATION. TRADE OPENNESS POSITIVELY INFLUENCES INNOVATION, BUT ONLY IN THE LONG RUN. THE RESULTS ACROSS SEVERAL ROBUST CHECKS REMAIN THE SAME. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
420	IT HAS BEEN REPORTED BUT STILL NOT VERIFIED WHY COVID-19 INFECTION TRANSMITTED DIFFERENTIALLY ACROSS SOCIETIES. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF CULTURAL ORIENTATION TO THE DIFFERENTIAL SPREAD OF PRESENT PANDEMIC. INITIALLY, ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY, A TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ANALYSIS WITH INDEX OF HISTORICAL PREVALENCE OF DISEASES AS AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE IS USED TO CLAIM THE FINDINGS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER INDIVIDUALISTIC VALUES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COVID-19 INFECTIONS AND VICE-VERSA. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR A NUMBER OF RELATED CONFOUNDING FACTORS SUCH AS DENSITY OF POPULATION, PERCENTAGE OF URBAN POPULATION, UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE INDEX, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS INDICATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL SPREADING OF COVID-19 INFECTIONS ACROSS COUNTRIES AND HENCE PROVIDE A RATIONALE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING, GOVERNMENT'S INTERVENTIONS AND ADHERENCE TO GROUP NORMS FOR CONTAINMENT OF THIS PANDEMIC.
421	THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO DISCUSS THE MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ELEVATION OF BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, IN DOCTRINAL TERMS, BUT ALSO WHAT CAN BE MEASURED FROM THIS RIGHT IN AXIOLOGICAL TERMS. THERE IS, IN THIS WORK, A DOGMATIC, BUT ALSO A ZETETIC CONCERN ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION AND THE SENSE OF A STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW BY THEODOR VIEHWEG. THE QUESTIONS THAT CHALLENGED THIS RESEARCH WAS: WHAT DOES THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MEAN UNDER THE DOGMATIC APPROACH? HOW CAN THIS CONCEPT CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIAL CHANGE? THROUGH A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW, IT IS DEFENDED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW CONSISTS IN THE RECOGNITION OF A DOGMATIC NORMATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THAT DEMANDS, IN THE DECISION MAKING, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INTEREST OF THE BALANCED ENVIRONMENT, ON WHICH MAN DEPENDS AND IS A PART, ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES, BEFORE THE AXIOLOGICAL VALUE OF SUSTAINABILITY.
422	CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION WAS INFLUENCED BY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES THAT HAPPENED FOLLOWING THE END OF THE COLD WAR IN 1989. TRADITIONAL CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION AIMING TO BUILD A MONOLITHIC NATIONAL IDENTITY, DISSEMINATE AN IMAGE OF HOMOGENEOUS SOCIETY AND TRANSMIT THE KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED TOWARDS MODERN CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION CHARACTERISED BY AN EMPHASIS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY AND A CONCERN TO DEVELOP STUDENTS' POLITICAL PARTICIPATION SKILLS. THE TRANSITION TO MODERN CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN TURKEY STARTED WITH THE PUSHING OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS AND IS STILL UNDERWAY. DRAWING ON CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY EXPLORES WHAT KIND OF CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION THE 2018 SOCIAL STUDIES COURSES PROGRAMME OF STUDY ENVISAGES. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE NEW PROGRAMME INTENSELY REFLECTS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF TRADITIONAL CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THIS STUDY'S FINDINGS MIGHT LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME AND INCREASE THE SUCCESS OF FUTURE CURRICULUM REFORMS.
423	TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY TURKEY HAS BEEN SHAPED BY TWO CONFLICTING TRENDS: ALL-ENCOMPASSING REFORM IN ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF LAW THAT WERE TRANSFORMATIVE IF NOT ALTOGETHER PROGRESSIVE, AND AN INCREASING EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH FINALLY CULMINATED IN A NATION-WIDE EMERGENCY REGIME AND THE APRIL 2017 CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM. THE PRESSING QUESTION FOR MANY IS WHY THE PROMISING REFORM ERA WAS ABANDONED FOR CRUDE REPRESSION? IN THIS ESSAY, WE ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY CHALLENGING ITS VERY FOUNDATION AND POINTING INSTEAD TO AN ALTERNATIVE LINE OF INQUIRY CONCERNING TURKISH POLITICS AND SOCIETY, ONE THAT FOCUSES PRECISELY ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN REFORM AND REPRESSION. THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM OF APRIL 2017 COMPELS OBSERVERS AND SCHOLARS OF TURKEY TO REEVALUATE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN REFORM AND REPRESSION. RATHER THAN READING CONTEMPORARY TURKEY AS A CASE OF RELAPSE FROM REFORM INTO REPRESSION, AS MANY COMMENTATORS DO, WE SUGGEST APPROACHING REFORM AND REPRESSION AS CONCOMITANT AND COMPLEMENTARY MODES OF GOVERNMENT.
424	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES THAT PERTAIN TO THE FINANCING OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS DURING THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, BUT RARELY ADDRESSED BY ACADEMIC WRITERS. IT IS NOWADAYS INCONCEIVABLE TO CONDUCT AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN WITHOUT ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES. UNDER POLISH LAW, OPEN AND TRANSPARENT FINANCING OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN IS AIMED NOT ONLY AT ENSURING A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE ELECTION, BUT ALSO AFFECTS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTED AUTHORITIES. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ANALYSIS OF, PRIMARILY, ELECTION CAMPAIGNS PRECEDING THE ELECTIONS OF 2010 AND 2015. TO GIVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE INSIGHT INTO THE DISCUSSED ISSUES AND TO SHOW SOME DYNAMICS OF THE FINANCING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS, THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS HAVE BEEN COMPARED WITH THE DATA ON ALL THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HELD IN POLAND AFTER 1990.
425	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF THREE STUDIES (2000-01, 2009 AND 2014) OF ACTIVITY-RELATED FACTORS THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PROSECUTORS WORK MOTIVATION. AS PART OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONDENTS (MORE THAN A THOUSAND PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OF DIFFERENT SEX, AGE, EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND PLACE OF SERVICE) WERE OFFERED TO COMPLETE THE UNFINISHED SENTENCE, STATING THE REASONS FOR THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THEIR WORK. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MAIN FACTORS STABLY DEFINING PROSECUTORS PROFESSIONAL MOTIVATION (80% OF RESPONSES) WERE SOCIALLY-ORIENTED NATURE OF THE WORK, ITS FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY, HELPING PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE POOR, DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE. (SELF-ACTUALIZATION, CREATIVITY, PROFESSIONAL GROWTH, AND OTHERS.). OTHER ANSWERS (HIGH WAGES, THE PRESTIGE OF THE PROFESSION, STABILITY AND OTHERS.) WERE GIVEN MUCH LESS. THE PROBLEM OF THE RELIABILITY OF THE DATA AND AN IMPACT OF SOCIAL DESIRABILITY WERE DISCUSSED.
426	FROM MY EIGHTEEN YEARS OF WORK AT CHINA'S MINISTRY OF COMMERCE, OF WHICH OVER A DOZEN YEARS ON CHINA TYRO CASES,FROM THE FIRST-EVER U.S.-STEEL SAFEGUARDS TO MOST OF THE IMPORTANT CASES, I TRY TO PROVIDE IN THIS ARTICLE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING IN CHINA: WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM IS A PEACEFUL AND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO SOLVE TRADE ISSUES BETWEEN CHINA AND OTHER WTO MEMBERS, AND CHINA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONFIDENT IN THIS SYSTEM AS IT IS EXPERIENCING MORE AND MORE CASES. THE 'EVIDENCE' IS FOUND IN TRAINING COURSES AND SEMINARS ON THE WTO IN THE EARLY DAYS, ITS FIRST 'EXCITING' CASE, THE FIRST FIVE 'QUIET' YEARS, THE SECOND FIVE 'NOISY' YEARS, AND THE SUBSEQUENT 'NORMAL' YEARS. IT CONCLUDES BY INTRODUCING THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THIS AREA, POINTING OUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE CASES, I.E., THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, AND EXPECTING A BETTER FUTURE FOR BOTH CHINA AND THE WTO WITH ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND SCHOOL TEACHING.
427	ERITREA WENT THROUGH A CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS FROM 1995 TO 1997, WHICH RESULTED IN A TEXT THAT PROVIDES FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE TEXT WAS RATIFIED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, BUT NEVER IMPLEMENTED. THE UNITED NATIONS, THE USA AND THE EU SUPPORT THE 1997 CONSTITUTION. THEY HAVE CALLED ON ERITREA TO "(I) MPLEMENT (IT) FULLY AND WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY". THIS RECOMMENDATION IS CHALLENGED HERE. ERITREA IS MULTI-ETHNIC, MULTI-RELIGIOUS AND MULTI-LINGUAL. THE 1997 CONSTITUTION CREATES A HIGHLY CENTRALIZED STALINIST STRUCTURE THAT EXPERIENCE TEACHES DOES NOT WORK IN DEEPLY DIVERSE DEMOCRACIES. ERITREA REQUIRES A POWER SHARING CONSTITUTION, FABRICATED IN A PROPER NEGOTIATED PROCESS. IMPLEMENTING THE 1997 CONSTITUTION WOULD LIKELY BRING ERITREA'S TWO LARGE NATIONALITIES INTO CONFLICT WITH ITS EIGHT SMALLER NATIONALITIES WITH HIGH RISK FOR VIOLENT CIVIL STRIFE THAT COULD SPILL OVER INTO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. THIS IS CONCERNING FOR GEOPOLITICS AND WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.
428	IT IS WIDELY ARGUED THAT AN EMPOWERED JUDICIARY SUPPORTS BETTER GOVERNANCE BY STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND HELPING TO MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND STABLE, BUT HOW SOLIDLY THAT REASONING IS BASED IN FACT HAS NOT BEEN CAREFULLY ANALYSED. AS RECENT EVENTS IN ASIA ILLUSTRATE, APPARENTLY SIMILAR CONSTITUTIONAL CHOICES ABOUT COURTS CAN HAVE VERY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON POLITICAL LIFE AND ULTIMATELY GOVERNANCE. TO ADDRESS THE RELATIVE LACK OF EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION AND MORE CLOSELY INVESTIGATE THE NEXUS BETWEEN COURTS AND GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE FIRST PRESENTS A BASIC TYPOLOGY OF JUDICIAL POLITICS AND THEN APPLIES IT TO THAILAND, SINGAPORE, KOREA AND JAPAN. THE INTENT IS TO: (1) PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED AND MORE NUANCED VIEW OF THE UNFOLDING JUDICIALISATION PHENOMENON; AND (2) URGE CLOSER ATTENTION TO HOW SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR IN ASIA RELATE TO DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE. THE STUDY THUS OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ILLUMINATE LARGER ISSUES AT THE INTERSECTION OF JUDICIAL ENGAGEMENT AND POLITICAL GOVERNANCE AND TO ADVANCE A THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH.
429	THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS LINKED TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF A RULE OF LAW, GUARANTEES OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND COLLECTIVE CITIZEN INTERVENTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS. THAT IS WHY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL ACTS OF CENSORSHIP IN THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES, WHICH MUST BE STRICTLY LIMITED. IN RECENT DECADES, THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH THE WORK OF ITS TWO PROTECTIVE ORGANS (THE INTER AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS) HAVE PRODUCED REPORTS AND STATEMENTS RELATING TO CASES BROUGHT BY CITIZENS OF THE REGION IN WHICH IT WAS INTENDED TO UPGRADE THE DOMESTIC LAW OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL TO SET: CHILE, PARAGUAY, COSTA RICA AND ARGENTINA HAVE BEEN THE LEADING CASE, AND IN THE ARGENTINE CASE STATEMENTS ARE GENERATED INTERNALLY TO COLLECT THAT OTHER REGIONAL LAW TO UPDATE THE DOMESTIC JURISDICTION THAT DOES NOT PROTECT SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES.
430	MORE THAN 85% OF BANGLADESH'S 150 MILLION PEOPLE ARE MUSLIMS. BANGLADESH EARNS ITS TITLE AS "THE THIRD LARGEST MUSLIM COUNTRY OF THE WORLD" FOLLOWING INDONESIA AND PAKISTAN BECAUSE OF ITS ENORMOUS SIZE OF MUSLIM POPULATION. THEIR RELIGION, ISLAM, IS HOWEVER BECOMING A "MINORITY" DAY BY DAY. WHILEMUSLIMS IN THE WEST-IN SPITE OF BEING A MINORITY-ARE ENJOYING THEIR BASIC RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, THIS BASIC RIGHT IS INCREASINGLY BEING DENIED TO THE MUSLIMS IN BANGLADESH WHILE IT CONTINUES TO ASPIRE TO BECOME A "UNIQUELY SECULAR" SOCIETY. BASED ON A ROBUST CONTENT ANALYSIS AND INTERVIEWS, THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THE CURRENT REGIME IN BANGLADESH HAS TAKEN ON A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY OF SECULARIZATION WITH AN AIM TO EMASCULATE ISLAMIC INFLUENCE FROM POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE OF BANGLADESH. APART FROM UNDERMINING BASIC RELIGIOUS FREEDOM OF MUSLIMS, THE POLICY-WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE BOTH AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT-IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING HOSTILE TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, AND POLITICAL PLURALISM.
431	KOSOVO'S DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM SERBIA WAS FOLLOWED BY SPORADIC VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND, AND SHARPLY DIVIDED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. RUSSIA, CHINA, INDIA AND A MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S NATIONS OPPOSED WHAT WAS CHARACTERISED AS ETHNIC SEPARATISM. THE UNITED STATES AND MUCH OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SUPPORTED KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE AS THE LAST STEP IN THE NON-CONSENSUAL BREAK-UP OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. UN SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON SOUGHT TO DEFUSE THE CRISIS WITH A PACKAGE OF MEASURES INCLUDING THE DRAWDOWN OF THE UN MISSION THAT HAD ADMINISTERED KOSOVO SINCE 1999, SECURITY COUNCIL SUPPORT FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION RULE-OF-LAW MISSION, AND A STATUS-NEUTRAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH RECOGNISING AND NON-RECOGNISING COUNTRIES COULD COOPERATE WHILE KOSOVO'S TRANSITION CONTINUED. ALMOST THREE YEARS LATER, KOSOVO'S NEW INSTITUTIONS HAVE PROGRESSED SIGNIFICANTLY; SERBIA IS GOVERNED BY MODERATES FOCUSED ON THAT COUNTRY'S EUROPEAN FUTURE, AND THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY AND CIVIL PRESENCES ARE BEING REDUCED.
432	THE URBAN INSTITUTE (UI) WORKED WITH FIVE CITIES IN POST-SOVIET KYRGYZSTAN TO APPLY BETTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC LAND MANAGEMENT PLANS. KYRGYZSTAN TRANSFERRED PROPERTY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, BUT MUNICIPAL LAND MANAGEMENT HAD REMAINED POOR OWING TO A PROLIFERATION OF RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES, LACK OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, AND PASSIVENESS ON THE PART OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UI WORKED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE AN INVENTORY OF MUNICIPAL LAND, PUBLICIZE THE RESULTS, AND DEVELOP A STRATEGY THAT ARTICULATED PRINCIPLES FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THIS LED TO SEVERAL IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDING PROPER REGISTRATION OF PARCELS AND PROACTIVE POLICIES TO LEASE AND SELL LAND THROUGH OPEN COMPETITION. IT ALSO ESTABLISHED A MODEL FOR DETERMINING PUBLIC POLICY THAT COUNTERED CORRUPTION AND PUBLIC DELIBERATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS IN THE USE OF LOCAL ASSETS. DONOR INVOLVEMENT TO PROMOTE GOOD LAND LEGISLATION, THE PROPERTY REGISTRATION SYSTEM, AND DECENTRALIZATION WAS ALSO CRITICAL TO SUCCESS.
433	WEIMAR GERMANY'S FIRST FOREIGN MINISTER, COUNT BROCKDORFF-RANTZAU, PRESENTED THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE OF 1919 WITH A PAMPHLET OF DETAILED GERMAN COUNTERPROPOSALS TO THE PEACE TERMS. IN A CONCISE COVER LETTER, WHICH WAS TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BY THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE, THE EXPERIENCED DIPLOMAT BROCKDORFF-RANTZAU PUT FORWARD HIS MOST CONVINCING ARGUMENTS FOR A FAIR SETTLEMENT AT VERSAILLES. THOUGH THE COUNTERPROPOSALS WERE ULTIMATELY REJECTED, THIS RARE DOCUMENT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE ONLY DIRECT ATTEMPTS AT NEGOTIATION THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN GERMANY AND THE ALLIED POWERS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES BROCKDORFF-RANTZAU'S STYLE OF NEGOTIATION IN ORDER TO DISCERN WHETHER THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S HOPES FOR A BALANCED SETTLEMENT WERE BASED ON NAIVET, OR CYNICISM. BY OUTLINING THREE COHERENT THEMES IN HIS WRITINGS-ANGER/DEFENSIVENESS, COMPROMISE, AND THE RULE OF LAW-THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT BROCKDORFF-RANTZAU'S WORDS ARE INDICATIVE OF A MORE CYNICAL MOTIVATION BEHIND HIS SEEMINGLY PERSPICUOUS ARGUMENTS.
434	THIS ARTICLE IS A REJOINDER TO THE REBUTTAL LETTER AUTHORED BY JAIR BOLSONARO'S FORMER MINISTER OF HEALTH AND SECRETARY OF PRIMARY CARE TO OUR INITIAL ARTICLE, 'FROM BOLSONARO TO LULA: THE OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE IN BRAZIL DURING THE GOVERNMENT TRANSITION,' PUBLISHED IN THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT. WE AIM TO REFUTE THE CLAIMS THAT WE CONSIDER UNSUBSTANTIATED AND DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY, WHILE REITERATING THE RISKS POSED BY AUTHORITARIAN AND ANTIDEMOCRATIC FAR-RIGHT GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS BOLSONARISM IN BRAZIL, TO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. THIS POLITICAL THREAT IS GAINING MOMENTUM ACROSS SEVERAL COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, THEREBY ENDANGERING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONS, AND SOCIAL POLICIES. FURTHERMORE, WE EMPHASISE THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT LULA'S GOVERNMENT, WHICH ALIGN WITH THE PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED DURING THE GOVERNMENTAL TRANSITION PROCESS AND STRENGTHEN THE PROSPECTS OF RECONSTRUCTING AND FORTIFYING THE BRAZILIAN UNIVERSAL HEALTH SYSTEM.
435	THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL TOOLS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF EU FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND THAT THE MECHANISMS OF COOPERATION BETWEEN OLAF AND THE EPPO ARE SUITABLE TO FOSTER A FUNCTIONING COLLABORATION. HOWEVER, CRITICISMS STILL EMERGE, BOTH ON THE FUNCTIONING OF OLAF, AND AS REGARDS OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE EPPO AND ITS COOPERATION WITH NATIONAL PROSECUTORS. GUARANTEES FOR PRIVATE PARTIES INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS CANNOT BE IGNORED, AND SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM AND PROTECTION OF GUARANTEES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SEPARATE, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT NEXTGENERATIONEU (NGEU) RAISES FOR THE PROTECTION OF EU FINANCIAL INTERESTS. GUARANTEES SUCH AS LEGAL CERTAINTY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, ARE BASIC TENETS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH, AS SET OUT IN THE CONDITIONALITY REGULATION AND FURTHER CLARIFIED BY THE ECJ, IS IN ITSELF A CONDITION FOR EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING EU FINANCIAL INTERESTS.
436	DURING HIS FOUR YEARS AS PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S USE OF THE CLEMENCY POWER GENERATED CONSIDERABLE CONTROVERSY. MUCH SCHOLARSHIP DOCUMENTS THE FACT THAT HE IGNORED THE TRADITIONAL PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING AND APPROVING REQUESTS FOR PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS. TRUMP USED CLEMENCY TO FAVOR A ROGUES GALLERY OF CRONIES, CELEBRITIES AND THOSE WHOSE CRIMES SHOWED PARTICULAR CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW HOWEVER, FEW SCHOLARS HAVE EXAMINED THE JUSTIFICATIONS HE OFFERED WHEN HE GRANTED PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS. THIS PAPER FILLS THAT GAP. WE ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THE CLEMENCY POWER SITS UNEASILY WITH DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHEN PRESIDENTS USE THIS POWER THEY FEEL THE NEED TO SUPPLY JUSTIFICATIONS. WE REPORT ON A STUDY OF TRUMP'S CLEMENCY JUSTIFICATIONS THAT SUGGESTS THAT WHILE HIS CLEMENCIES THEMSELVES WERE OFTEN CONTROVERSIAL AND HIS MEANS OF COMMUNICATING ABOUT THEM UNCONVENTIONAL, THE REASONS HE GAVE FOR THEM WERE GENERALLY QUITE CONVENTIONAL AND CONTINUOUS WITH THE JUSTIFICATIONS OFFERED BY HIS PREDECESSORS FOR THEIR PARDONS AND COMMUTATIONS.
437	THE PAPER MADE AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON HOW INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE AFFECTS THE RISK PREFERENCE OF ENTERPRISES' OFDI BY USING THE SAMPLE OF A-SHARE LISTED COMPANIES IN CHINA FROM 2014 TO 2018 AND FURTHER EXPLORED HOW INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE AFFECTED ENTERPRISES' PREFERENCE FOR LOW-RISK INVESTMENT IN OFDI IN "THE BELT AND ROAD" AND OTHER COUNTRIES THROUGH FUZZY SET QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE RISK PREFERENCE OF ENTERPRISES' OFDI. SIX FACTORS, SUCH AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, FORM DIVERSIFIED CONFIGURATION FORMS AND INFLUENCE PATHS THAT AFFECT THE RISK PREFERENCE OF CHINESE ENTERPRISES' OFDI. THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS THAT "HIGH VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, LOW GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND LOW CORRUPTION CONTROL" WILL DRIVE ENTERPRISES' LOW-RISK INVESTMENT PREFERENCE IN "THE BELT AND ROAD" COUNTRIES; AND "LOW GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, LOW REGULATORY QUALITY AND HIGH LEGAL LEVEL" WILL DRIVE ENTERPRISES' LOW-RISK INVESTMENT PREFERENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
438	BACKGROUND: TRADITIONAL MEDICINE (HERBAL MEDICINE, STANDARDIZED HERBAL MEDICINE, PHYTOPHARMACA (CLINICAL-BASED HERBAL MEDICINE), IMPORTED TRADITIONAL MEDICINE) IS AN INGREDIENT OR HERB INGREDIENTS IN THE FORM OF PLANT INGREDIENTS, ANIMAL INGREDIENTS, MINERAL INGREDIENTS, GALENIC PREPARATIONS, OR A MIXTURE OF SUCH INGREDIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR TREATMENT FOR GENERATIONS, AND CAN BE APPLIED BY THE NORMS PREVAILING IN THE SOCIETY. AIM: TO FIND OUT AND ANALYZE RELATED TO THE SUPERVISION AND REGISTRATION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE BRANDS IN INDONESIA. METHODOLOGY: THIS RESEARCH USES A QUALITATIVE METHOD WITH A NORMATIVE JURIDICAL APPROACH. DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES ARE CARRIED OUT THROUGH LIBRARY STUDIES. CONCLUSION: SUPERVISION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE BRANDS' REGISTRATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT TO THE MAXIMUM BY THE NATIONAL AGENCY OF DRUG AND FOOD CONTROL (NADFC). THIS AVOIDS THE PROBLEMS THAT WILL ARISE IN THE EVENT OF THE OBSCURITY OF THE SURVEILLANCE PROCESS. GOOD AND PROPER SUPERVISION MUST BE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE INDONESIA RECOGNIZES THE LAW'S EXISTENCE.
439	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ORIGINS, STRUCTURE AND ROLE OF THE POLISH COUNTERTERRORISM SYSTEM, WHICH IS THEN SET AGAINST THE RISING THREAT POSED BY STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS EMPLOYING HYBRID WARFARE TOOLS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF ANTI-TERRORIST REGULATIONS, NOT ONLY IN COUNTERACTING TERRORIST GROUPS, BUT ALSO IN THE THWARTING OF OPERATIONS ENGAGED IN BY VARIOUS ENTITIES WAGING HYBRID WARFARE. WE ARGUE THAT LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPER PRESCRIPTIONS THAT SEEK TO TACKLE HYBRID THREATS. EXTENSIVE ANTI-TERROR INSTRUMENTS AND MEASURES IMPLEMENTED SINCE 2016 ARE AMONG THE KEY ELEMENTS IN THE CONTEMPORARY DEFENSE AND SECURITY DOCTRINE BEING PURSUED BY POLAND. HOWEVER, WHILE THE NEW REGULATIONS HAVE PROVIDED INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WITH STRONG POWERS THAT MARKEDLY ENHANCE THEIR CAPABILITIES REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF HYBRID THREATS, THE SAME FLEXIBLE LEGAL REGULATIONS, SUBJECT TO BROAD INTERPRETATION, MAY ALSO SERVE A PARTISAN AGENDA, AND THUS ENDANGER THE RULE OF LAW.
440	THE 2015 RELEASE OF HARPER LEE'S NOVEL GO SET A WATCHMAN LED TO A FRENZIED REACTION FROM ADMIRERS OF TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. THIS RUSH TO DECIPHER ATTICUS'S RACIAL ATTITUDES OVERSHADOWED LEE'S FULL UNVEILING OF IMPORTANT NEW DIMENSIONS IN THE FINCH FAMILY TALE. FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE HEART OF BOTH NOVELS IS THE MORAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEAN LOUISE "SCOUT" FINCH. SCOUT'S COMPLICATED EDUCATION IN CIVIC, MORAL, AND LEGAL VIRTUE REQUIRES READERS TO MAKE SENSE OF ATTICUS AS A TEACHER. HIS LESSONS ON JUSTICE AND HIS POLITICAL ACTIONS IN WATCHMAN ILLUMINATE HIS JURISPRUDENCE IN MOCKINGBIRD AS WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL RIGHTS TRADITIONS OF A JURIST SUCH AS HUGO BLACK. FINALLY, WATCHMAN COMPLETES THE ARC OF JEAN LOUISE'S EDUCATION BY ILLUSTRATING THE DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES OF POLITICAL LIFE WITHOUT FRIENDSHIP. READ TOGETHER, THE NOVELS OFFER A COHERENT AND EXTRAORDINARY COMMENTARY ON AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE AND THOUGHT.
441	THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS ACTIONS THAT APPEAR HOSTILE TO SCIENTISTS, SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, AND SCIENTIFIC DATA, LEADING SOME OBSERVERS TO ASSERT THAT A WAR ON SCIENCE IS UNDERWAY. A MORE PRECISE CHARACTERIZATION IS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ENGAGING IN A WAR ON REGULATORY SCIENCE, AS THESE ACTIONS TAKE AIM SPECIFICALLY AT REGULATORY SCIENCE-I.E., KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AND SYNTHESIS CARRIED OUT BY EPA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN THE COURSE OF DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT ("APA") AND OTHER LAWS MAY CONSTRAIN SOME ASPECTS OF THE WAR ON REGULATORY SCIENCE, PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW. INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND AGENCY NORMS ALSO CAN PROMOTE RULE OF LAW VALUES, BUT THEIR SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE GOOD FAITH OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTORS AND THE WILLINGNESS OF CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC TO PUSH HACK WHEN NORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGALITY ARE IGNORED. ABSENT SUCH PUSHBACK, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON REGULATORY SCIENCE COULD LEAD TO IRRATIONAL POLICIES AND THREATEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE.
442	THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2008 BROUGHT ABOUT A RAPID DEPRECIATION IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE HUNGARIAN FORINT (HUF). DEBTORS IN HUNGARY HAD BORROWED MONEY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES-ESPECIALLY THE SWISS FRANC-AND NOW FOUND THEMSELVES IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DETERIORATING SITUATION. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED INDEBTEDNESS REACHED ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. ON VARIOUS GROUNDS, CONSUMERS TOOK OUT NUMEROUS CIVIL LAW PROCEEDINGS TO CHALLENGE CONSUMER LOAN AGREEMENTS. QUESTIONS RAISED BY THESE LAWSUITS WERE, SEVERAL TIMES, BROUGHT TO HUNGARY'S SUPREME COURT, AND WERE THEN TAKEN TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE LEGISLATIVE ACTS AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAT ENSUED WERE SUBSEQUENTLY REVIEWED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF HUNGARY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CASE LAW THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT APPLIED IN THIS CRISIS SITUATION, AND BRINGS OUT THE LACK OF BALANCING CAPACITY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION. REFERRING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF BASIC RULE OF LAW, THE AUTHOR MAKES A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE NEW CONSTITUTIONAL IDEAS, MEASURES AND LEGAL SOLUTIONS THAT EMERGED.
443	THIS PAPER SCRUTINISES THE INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) MECHANISM, WHICH ALLOWS FOREIGN INVESTORS TO SUE HOST GOVERNMENTS FOR ANY REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECT PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. IT GIVES INVESTORS RIGHTS OVER HOST-STATES - AND LOCAL POPULATIONS - IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS. THE FOCUS OF THIS ARTICLE IS A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF HOW THE ISDS INSTITUTIONALISES A FRAMEWORK OF EXCEPTIONALITY THAT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM; ONE THAT CENTRES UPON THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF SUBJECTING PUBLIC REGULATION TO THE RATIONALITY OF THE MARKET. WE ARGUE THAT THIS PRIVATISED QUASI-LEGAL ARENA IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND SOCIALLY EMANCIPATORY PRACTICES. WHAT THIS REVEALS IS THAT THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS THAT MOBILISE AND SHAPE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW ARE CHARACTERISED BY CAPITALIST CLASS RELATIONS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME REFLECTIONS UPON THE MARKETIZATION OF PUBLIC REGULATION THROUGH THE ISDS, WHERE PROFITABILITY AND COST-REDUCTION ARE PRIORITISED OVER HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS.
444	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON RECENT FRENCH EFFORTS TO EXPAND LEGAL REGULATION OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS TO CHILDCARE. CONTROVERSIES OVER VEILED NANNIES' SERVE AS POINTS OF DEPARTURE FOR INVESTIGATING LAICITE - FRENCH SECULARISM - THROUGH WHICH RELIGION IS REGULATED. THE INVESTIGATION IS BASED ON FIELDWORK AMONG MUSLIM WOMEN IN MARSEILLE AND ON THE ANALYSIS OF LEGAL DECISIONS, OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, AND MEDIA. THE DEBATES ON WHETHER TO LEGISLATE ON RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS IN THE DOMAIN OF CHILDCARE REVEAL HOW THE LINE BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS, AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC IS CONTINUOUSLY REDRAWN THROUGH STATE EFFORTS TO CULTIVATE AND GOVERN (SECULAR) REPUBLICAN SELVES. DRAWING ON AGRAMA'S [2012A. QUESTIONING SECULARISM: ISLAM, SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN EGYPT. CHICAGO, IL: UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS] CONCEPTUALISATION OF SECULARISM AS A PROBLEM-SPACE', I ARGUE THAT LEGAL REGULATION OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS INSTITUTIONALISES A SECULAR SUSPICION' AT THE HEART OF EFFORTS TO IMAGINE AND GOVERN FRENCH SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE, A FUTURE IN WHICH MUSLIMS INCREASINGLY FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THEMSELVES.
445	ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON A FAIR MARKETPLACE, WHEREBY ALL FIRMS PLAY BY THE SAME RULES. EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW AND STRONG REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT REGIMES MAKE THIS POSSIBLE IN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. EMERGING MARKETS ARE MUCH LESS SUCCESSFUL IN REGULATING FIRMS, LEADING TO EXTENSIVE INFORMAL ECONOMIES REPLETE WITH UNREGULATED FIRMS. THESE UNREGULATED FIRMS UNDERCUT THE MARKET BY EVADING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEGITIMATE FIRM OPERATIONS, SKIRTING TAXATION AND DISCOURAGING INVESTMENT IN THE FORMAL MARKETPLACE. MANY EMERGING MARKET GOVERNMENTS HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS PROBLEM WITH FORMALIZATION PROGRAMS AIMED AT INCENTIVIZING THE MOVEMENT OF INFORMAL FIRMS INTO THE FORMAL ECONOMY. IN THIS PAPER, WE ASSESS A RECENT AND COMPREHENSIVE FORMALIZATION PROGRAM TO EVALUATE ITS STRATEGY AND SUCCESS. WE CONCLUDE THAT AN INCENTIVIZATION PROGRAM LIKE THIS ONE, AIMED AT REDUCING THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, MISSES THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES THAT LEAD TO HIGH LEVELS OF INFORMALITY. WE RECOMMEND A MORE NUANCED APPROACH THAT ADDRESSES PRODUCTIVITY BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORMALIZE MICRO-ENTERPRISES.
446	WHAT EFFECT DO PRO-MARKET ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE ON LABOUR RIGHTS? DESPITE SIGNIFICANT DEBATE IN POLICY AND ACADEMIC CIRCLES ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF ECONOMIC LIBERALISATION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE LABOUR RIGHTS EFFECTS OF PRO-MARKET POLICIES. EXTANT LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF MARKET-LIBERALISING POLICIES, SUCH AS TRADE AND INVESTMENT FLOWS, RATHER THAN DIRECTLY ASSESSING MARKET-FRIENDLY POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS. MOREOVER, THIS LINE OF RESEARCH HAS FOUND MIXED RESULTS ON HOW THESE OUTCOMES INFLUENCE LABOUR CONDITIONS. TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THIS LINKAGE, THIS ARTICLE COMBINES DATA ON FIVE DISTINCT POLICY AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC LIBERALISATION WITH DATA ON LABOUR RIGHTS FOR THE PERIOD 1981-2012. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRO-MARKET POLICIES - EXCEPT THE ONES INVOLVING RULE OF LAW AND SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS - UNDERMINE LABOUR RIGHTS. THUS WHILE THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH MARKET-SUPPORTING POLICIES, ECONOMIC LIBERALISATION COMES AT THE COST OF RESPECT FOR LABOUR RIGHTS.
447	THIS ARTICLE STARTS WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE CHINESE JUSTICE SYSTEM, PAST AND PRESENT, TO RECONSIDER INFORMAL JUSTICE (AMONG THE PEOPLE) AND FORMAL JUSTICE (OF THE STATE), EMPHASIZING ESPECIALLY THE INTERDEPENDENCE, OVERLAP, AND INTERACTION OF THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. IT THEN COMPARES THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK EMPLOYED BY THE RULE OF LAW INDEX OF THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT (WJP), TO BRING OUT THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SINITIC LEGAL TRADITION AND MODERN WESTERN JUSTICE, AND ALSO THE SHARP CONTRASTS BETWEEN CHINESE MEDIATION AND WESTERN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR). THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW A NUMBER OF INFLUENTIAL COMMON ASSUMPTIONS ARE MISTAKEN, AND HOW THE SINITIC LEGAL TRADITION REMAINS IMPORTANT IN CONTEMPORARY JUSTICE, NOT JUST OF CHINA BUT ALSO THE OTHER MAJOR EAST ASIAN CIVILIZATION COUNTRIES. THE PURPOSE IS TO SEARCH FOR A PATH THAT WOULD GO BEYOND THE EITHER/OR BINARY OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND THE WESTERN, AND THE PAST AND THE PRESENT.
448	USING SINGAPORE AS AN EXTENDED CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IDEA OF AUTHORITARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH IT IDENTIFIES AS A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT COMBINES REASONABLY FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS WITH A MODERATE DEGREE OF REPRESSIVE CONTROL OF EXPRESSION AND LIMITS ON PERSONAL FREEDOM. AFTER DESCRIBING OTHER VERSIONS OF NON-LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, INCLUDING "MERE" RULE-OF-LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN EXTENDED ANALYSIS AND CRITIQUE OF ACCOUNTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND COURTS IN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES. SUCH ACCOUNTS ARE LARGELY STRATEGIC AND INSTRUMENTAL, AND, I ARGUE, CANNOT FULLY EXPLAIN THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONS EVEN IN THOSE COUNTRIES. RATHER, I ARGUE, WHERE CONSTITUTIONALISM EXISTS IN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS, IT DOES SO BECAUSE THE RULES HAVE A MODEST NORMATIVE COMMITMENT TO CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY DESCRIBING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTHORITARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND OFFERING A MODEST DEFENSE OF ITS NORMATIVE APPEAL IN NATIONS WITH SPECIFIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS, SUCH AS A HIGH DEGREE OF PERSISTENT ETHNIC CONFLICT.
449	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON LEVELS OF WATER POLLUTION FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS BY SOME SPECIFIC INDUSTRY CATEGORY IN A SAMPLE OF OECD ECONOMIES. USING AN INSTITUTIONAL ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE ARE EMPIRICALLY EXAMINED. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE NEGATIVELY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH WATER POLLUTION ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS SPECIFIC INDUSTRY GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE THAT GOVERNANCE MATTERS FOR MITIGATING INDUSTRIAL WATER POLLUTION. THIS NOVEL PAPER ADDS TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON INDUSTRIAL WATER POLLUTION BY DEVELOPING A MODELING APPROACH THAT EMPIRICALLY EXAMINES QUESTIONS THAT HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN INSTITUTIONAL ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS AND DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING REAL LIFE ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT ARE COMMON ACROSS THE WORLD. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DRAWN. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
450	ANTI-JAPANESE SENTIMENT IN KOREA IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMIES AND SECURITY OF SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, WITH STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES. SOUTH KOREANS PASSIONATELY PROTEST WHEN JAPANESE POLITICIANS MAKE INSENSITIVE REMARKS ABOUT HISTORY OR CLAIM THE KOREAN-CONTROLLED ISLAND OF DOKDO AS TAKESHIMA. HOWEVER, ANTI-JAPANESE SENTIMENT IS INHIBITING COOPERATION WITH TOKYO THAT IS CLEARLY IN SOUTH KOREA'S INTERESTS, INCLUDING A RECENTLY SCUPPERED INTELLIGENCE-SHARING AGREEMENT. SEOUL NEEDS TOKYO'S HELP WITH NORTH KOREA, WHETHER FOR CONFLICT CONTINGENCIES OR FOR MOVING TOWARD OR REALIZING PEACEFUL UNIFICATION. PROBLEMS IN SEOUL-TOKYO RELATIONS CONCERN WASHINGTON IN THE AREA OF LOSS OF SECURITY-ENHANCING, COST-SAVING TRILATERAL COORDINATION. KOREAN AND JAPANESE SHARED VALUES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, ECONOMIC FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW CAN SUPPORT FURTHER ECONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL COOPERATION. SOUTH KOREA'S INTERESTS WOULD BE SERVED BY SHOWING LEADERSHIP IN RESUMING REGULAR DIPLOMACY IN NORTHEAST ASIA AND BY EMPHASIZING STRATEGIC COOPERATION RATHER THAN HISTORICAL ANIMOSITIES.
451	THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO CONTEXTUOLISE GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN RELATION TO CONFLICTS WITH SPECIOL MENTION TO CONFLICTS ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IS FRAMED WITHIN THE OEDIPAL COMPLEX OF THE DOMINANCE AND SUBMISSION MODEL WHEREBY DOMINANCE IS ASSERTED THROUGH VIOLENCE. THIS MODEL IS ALSO USED TO FRAME THE CONTEXT OF CONFLICTS AS A MASCULINE CONSTRUCTION. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE WITH REGARD TO RESPONSES FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL AND MEDICAL TREATMENT IN THE RESTORATION AND REHABILITATION OF POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF CONFLICTS HAS SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR HIV AND AIDS. INCUBATION PERIODS FOR THE HI VIRUS ARE DECREASED WHEN IT IS COUPLED TOGETHER WITH PSYCHOSOCIAL TRAUMA AND MALNUTRITION. THEREFORE, GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AND HIV AND AIDS HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF CONFLICTS DUE TO ADEQUATE RESPONSES IN THE ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO METE OUT TREATMENT.
452	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO ASSESS HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BEEN TREATED IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE WORLD BANK ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL (WBAT). IN SO DOING, THE WORK WILL NOT DELIVER A THOROUGH SYNOPSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISPRUDENCE, BUT RATHER A TOUR D'HORIZON OF ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS RELATED TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE ABOVE-NAMED TASK. THE NOTION OF TREATMENT INDICATES HERE THE TOOLS THROUGH WHICH WBAT JUDGES HAVE CHALLENGED INTERNATIONAL LAW. WBAT JUDGES HAVE UTILIZED BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE REFERENCES WHEN CONSIDERING INTERNATIONAL LAW; NEGATIVE TREATMENT HAS BEEN UTILIZED TO DIFFERENTIATE WBAT FROM OTHER JUDICIAL BODIES, WHILE POSITIVE TREATMENT HAS BEEN EMPLOYED TO SUPPORT THE REASONING OF THE WBAT. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE APPROACH OF THE WBAT WILL BE EXAMINED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH IF IT IS PRONE TO ACCEPTING INTERNATIONAL RULES. THE LEVEL OF RECEPTION OF EXTERNAL SOURCES IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN INDICATOR OF THE WBAT'S UNIVERSALISM OR PROVINCIALISM. THEREFORE, THE WORK TRIES TO DEMONSTRATE IF THE WBAT IS INCORPORATED INTO THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND IF THE TRIBUNAL MIGHT BE ALLEGED AS AN ANTI-FRAGMENTATION OR A HARMONIZING BODY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. LIKE THE OTHER INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS, THE WBAT IS A TRIBUNAL WITH A RESTRICTED SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANTI-FRAGMENTATION AS A COMPONENT OF ITS MANDATE. NEVERTHELESS, AS AN EVOLVING COURT, THE WBAT SHOULD BE FITTED TO THE PRESENT FRAGMENTED NORMATIVE SCENARIO. MOREOVER, THE WBAT IS A PROMINENT TRIBUNAL; ITS JURISPRUDENCE MIGHT HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE JURISPRUDENCE OF NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. AS SUCH, IT MIGHT THEORETICALLY DIMINISH FRAGMENTATION AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
453	THE REALISATION OF GLOBAL CARBON NEUTRALITY IS CRUCIAL FOR COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE. AS THE LARGEST EMITTER, CHINA DECLARED TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2060. HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE ENERGY STRUCTURE ARE FAR FROM BEING ACHIEVED. USING TIME SERIES DATA FROM 2001 TO 2019 AND THE ARDL-ECM METHOD, THIS PAPER EXPLORED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLIMATE POLICIES IN CONTROLLING CHINA'S CARBON EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL FACTORS SUCH AS ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ENERGY STRUCTURE ARE THE DETERMINANTS OF CARBON EMISSIONS. A GREEN PARADOX IS SHOWN SINCE INCREASING CLIMATE POLICY DENSITY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. THE MAIN REGULATORY GAPS IN CHINA'S CLIMATE GOVERNANCE INCLUDE WEAKNESSES IN THE RULE OF LAW, LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY, AND INSUFFICIENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR EQUITABLE ENERGY TRANSITIONS. A BINDING LEGAL SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO REALISE ABSOLUTE REDUCTION AND SECURE CARBON NEUTRALITY, ESPECIALLY ONE INCLUDING SPECIFIC CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, BINDING REDUCTION TARGETS, AND COMBINING ENERGY JUSTICE WITH REGULATORY EFFICIENCY.
454	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE OF ENFORCEMENT WITH DECISIONS OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE HYPOTHESES OF NONCOMPLIANCE, THE WAY IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL ELITES SEEK TO VIOLATE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, JUDICIAL DECISIONS, REVERSE THEM OR RETALIATE AGAINST COURT, AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIES USED BY IT TO OBTAIN COMPLIANCE. TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, THE RESEARCH IS DEVELOPED BASED ON BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH, WITH A TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, WHICH MAINLY INVOLVES THE PERSPECTIVES OF LAW, POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL SOCIOLOGY, AS WELL AS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-PROFILE CASES JUDGED BY THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. IN THE END, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT REAL POWER FACTORS, SUCH AS THE INTERESTS OF POLITICAL ELITES OR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, ARE DECISIVE FOR ANALYZING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS BY THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND ITS COMPLIANCE WHEN CONFRONTING POLITICAL INTERESTS, A SITUATION IN WHICH THE AUTHORITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT ARE TESTED, AND THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY MAY BE CALLED INTO QUESTION.
455	INDIA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY, HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A DEMOCRATIC DECLINE. SINCE COMING TO POWER IN 2014 AND WINNING REELECTION IN 2019, PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI AND THE BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ILLIBERAL AND AUTHORITARIAN. THE RULE OF LAW HAS DETERIORATED, RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES HAVE BEEN CURTAILED, AND SCHOLARS AND THE MEDIA HAVE BEEN SILENCED. IF ELECTORAL CONSTRAINT, CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND A FREE PRESS HAVEN'T SLOWED INDIA'S MARCH TOWARD ILLIBERALISM, WHAT CAN? IN NOVEMBER 2020, INDIA'S FARMERS BEGAN A HIGHLY ORGANIZED PROTEST AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. IN THIS RESEARCH NOTE, I ASK, HOW HAS THIS PROTEST PROTECTED INDIAN DEMOCRACY FROM FURTHER DEGRADATION, AND HAS IT RADICALLY ALTERED INDIA'S POLITICAL FUTURE? I ARGUE THAT THE FARMERS' PROTEST PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE VISION OF DEMOCRACY, ONE ROOTED IN RADICAL EGALITARIANISM. PROTESTING FARMERS HAVE ACTUALIZED THE SPIRIT OF DISSENT ENSHRINED IN THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION BY HOLDING THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO IT.
456	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE INJUNCTION IN S 75(V) OF THE CONSTITUTION AVAILABLE TO RESTRAIN GOVERNMENT ACTION THAT IS UNLAWFUL BUT DOES NOT AMOUNT TO JURISDICTIONAL ERROR THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROACHES TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL INJUNCTION IN THE RECENT HIGH COURT DECISION, SMETHURST V COMMISSIONER OF POLICE. USING CASES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES PRIOR TO FEDERATION, I WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INJUNCTION HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN ISSUED IN THE COURTS' EQUITABLE JURISDICTION TO PREVENT ANY AND ALL BREACHES OF THE LAW BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS. FURTHER, THE WIDE SCOPE OF THE INJUNCTION ALSO GIVES EFFECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LONG COMMON LAW TRADITION OF USING PRIVATE LAW PRINCIPLES TO HOLD OFFICIALS TO ACCOUNT. FINALLY, I WILL DISCUSS SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES THAT DERIVE FROM THIS CONCLUSION, SUCH AS THE RELEVANCE OF DISCRETIONARY FACTORS, MATERIALITY, AND ANY POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE CENTRALITY OF JURISDICTIONAL ERROR TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
457	THE CONCEPT OF A FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC (FOIP) IS TAKING FIRM HOLD AS A NEW CORE VISION OF JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY. IT HAS BEEN ENDORSED AT THE US-JAPAN AND GROUP OF SEVEN (G7) SUMMITS. SO FAR, HOWEVER, THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT DISCUSSION ABOUT SPECIFIC APPROACHES TO PROMOTE IT. IN PARTICULAR, THE DISCUSSION ON SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE REGION WHERE THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND THE INDIAN OCEAN MEET, HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT. SHOULD SOUTHEAST ASIA COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHINA, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FOIP WOULD BE HALVED. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A WESTERN PACIFIC UNION (WPU) AT THE HEART OF FOIP AS A LOOSE REGIONAL ASSOCIATION BY GROUPING THE WESTERN PACIFIC COUNTRIES INCLUDING JAPAN, MAJOR SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES (INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, AND VIET NAM), AUSTRALIA AND PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES. THE PROPOSED WPU AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE REGIONAL AND WORLD'S PEACE AND PROSPERITY, WHILE NOT CONFRONTING CHINA, BY UPHOLDING THE PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
458	ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF GLOBALISATION HAS BEEN POPULATION MOBILITY AS A RESULT OF FAMINE, CLIMATE WARMING AND WAR CONFLICTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. THIS FLOW OF REFUGEES, HOWEVER, IS OFTEN SEEN AS A MENACE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONCOMITANT WITH THE WESTERN LIFESTYLE. REFUGEES ARE NO LONGER REGARDED AS HUMAN BEINGS AND VICTIMS, BUT RATHER AS DANGER, EVEN AS POTENTIAL TERRORISTS, WHICH HAS LED MANY GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING THE AUSTRALIAN, TO DETAIN THEM INDEFINITELY IN DETENTION CENTRES WHERE THEY ARE CONFINED IN INHUMAN CONDITIONS. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER WILL BE TO DESCRIBE AUSTRALIAN IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND HOW CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIAN NARRATIVES ON AND BY REFUGEES ARE REFLECTING THIS SITUATION, MAINLY BY ANALYSING A SELECTION OF TEXTS FROM THREE RECENTLY PUBLISHED COLLECTIONS, NAMELY, A COUNTRY TOO FAR (2013), THEY CANNOT TAKE THE SKY (2017) AND SEABIRDS CRYING IN THE HARBOUR DARK (2017), AND BEHROUZ BOOCHANI'S NO FRIEND BUT THE MOUNTAINS (2018).
459	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCH INTO TAX FRAUD AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. INFORMED BY RESEARCH APPROACHES FROM ACROSS TAX LAW, PUBLIC ECONOMICS, CRIMINOLOGY, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, ECONOMICS OF CRIME, AND REGULATORY THEORY, IT ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS, AND THE LEGITIMACY, OF CURRENT APPROACHES TO COMBATING TAX FRAUD, BRINGING NEW DIMENSIONS TO PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED TRENDS IN CRIME CONTROL. IT ARGUES THAT, WHILST THE LAST DECADE HAS WITNESSED A SIGNIFICANT INTENSIFICATION OF MEASURES THAT PURPORTEDLY TARGET TAX FRAUD, PREFERENCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY GIVEN TO ENFORCEMENT MEASURES THAT MAXIMIZE REVENUE GAINS RATHER THAN COMBAT THE FRAUD ITSELF, EVEN WHERE THE EFFECT IS TO AGGRAVATE THE NON-REVENUE COSTS OF TAX FRAUD. THESE DEVELOPMENTS DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT FROM TAX FRAUD SUPPRESSION TO TAX FRAUD MANAGEMENT. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THIS SHIFT NOT ONLY UNDERMINES TAX EQUITY AND OVERALL TAX COMPLIANCE, BUT ALSO LEADS TO SELECTIVE TAX ENFORCEMENT, THUS REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE RULE OF LAW.
460	THE ORIGINAL 1920S DEBATE BETWEEN JOHN DEWEY AND WALTER LIPPMANN CONCERNED WHETHER THE MODERN ELECTORATE CAN MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE IN DEMOCRATIC SELF-RULE RATHER THAN BE RULED BY TECHNOCRATIC EXPERTS. LESS WELL KNOWN IS THE FURTHER DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THESE TWO THINKERS SPARKED BY LIPPMANN'S 1937 BOOK THE GOOD SOCIETY. THIS WORK WAS SEMINAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FREE MARKET NEOLIBERALISM AND IS LINKED TO BOTH F. A. HAYEK'S 1944 THE ROAD TO SERFDOM AND THE FOUNDING OF THE MONT PELERIN SOCIETY. THE CORE OF LIPPMANN'S POLITICAL THEORY IS A LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE COMPETITIVE MARKET AND A CONSTRAINT ON THE DEMOCRATIC STATE. DEWEY, FIERCE CRITIC OF CAPITALISM, HARSHLY REVIEWED LIPPMANN'S BOOK, INSISTING ON DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY, THOUGH HE FAILED TO SATISFACTORILY SPECIFY HOW THAT WOULD WORK. THIS SECOND DEWEY-LIPPMANN DEBATE IS A FORERUNNER OF CURRENT THEORETICAL DISPUTES OVER THE COMPATIBILITY OF NEOLIBERALISM AND DEMOCRACY.
461	FOLLOWING ON FROM A DIALOGUE BETWEEN JURGEN HABERMAS AND JOSEPH RATZINGER IN 2004 ON THE PRE-POLITIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, SOME KEY POINTS OF POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATIONS AND ONE STRUCTURAL DEFECT OF THE STATE ARE DISCUSSED: EVEN THE MOST DEMOCRATIC STATE TENDS TO THREATEN THE FREEDOM OF ITS CITIZENS. RATZINGER AND HABERMAS ASSIGN DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS TO RELIGIOUS FAITH IN ORDER TO REMEDY THIS AND RELATED DEFECTS: RATZINGER FOCUSES ON DEEP RELIGIOUS CONVICTION, HABERMAS ON CULTURAL CHRISTIANITY. AGAINST THESE VIEWS, THE THESIS HERE PUT FORWARD IS THAT THE PROPOSED REMEDIES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. RATHER, WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A METAPHYSICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE STATE AND OF MORALITY METAPHYSICAL IN THE CRITICAL KANTIAN SENSE - BASED ON THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND AND TO EVALUATE IN AN ADEQUATE WAY THE NECESSITY OF A MULTITUDE OF PARTICULAR DEMOCRATIC STATES AND THE SINGLENESS OF A UNIVERSAL ETHICAL COMMUNITY.
462	THE LOW-LEVEL MISDEMEANOR PROCESS IS A POWERFUL SOCIO-LEGAL INSTITUTION THAT BOTH REGULATES AND GENERATES INEQUALITY. AT THE SAME TIME, MISDEMEANOR LEGAL PROCESSING OFTEN IGNORES MANY FOUNDATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE VALUES SUCH AS DUE PROCESS, EVIDENCE, AND EVEN INDIVIDUAL GUILT. THESE FEATURES ARE LINKED: THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE CONCRETE MECHANISMS ENABLING THE MISDEMEANOR SYSTEM TO TAKE AIM AT THE DISADVANTAGED, RATHER THAN AT THE MERELY GUILTY. IN THE BOOK MISDEMEANORLAND, ISSA KOHLER-HAUSMANN DESCRIBES THE INEGALITARIAN WORKINGS OF THE MISDEMEANOR LEGAL PROCESS IN NEW YORK CITY AND HOW IT OPERATES AS A SYSTEM OF MANAGERIAL SOCIAL CONTROL OVER THE DISADVANTAGED EVEN WHEN IT STOPS SHORT OF CONVICTING AND INCARCERATING THEM. THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE BOOK'S KEY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BURGEONING SCHOLARLY DISCOURSE ON MISDEMEANORS AND THEN EXTENDS ITS INSIGHTS ABOUT NEW YORK TO ILLUMINATE THE BROADER DYNAMICS AND DEMOCRATIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE U.S. MISDEMEANOR PROCESS.
463	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE EFFECTS OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS OF A COUNTRY, ALONG WITH THE QUALITY OF SOME OF ITS KEY CHARACTERISTICS, ON INTERNATIONAL TOURISM INFLOWS AND THE REVENUES A COUNTRY DERIVES FROM THEM. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT INCREASES IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY REDUCE TRANSACTION COSTS AND RISKS FACED BY BOTH SUPPLIERS OF INTERNATIONAL TOURIST SERVICES AND TOURISTS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT COUNTRIES WITH "HIGHER QUALITY" OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS ARE LIKELY TO ATTRACT MORE INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS AND DERIVE MORE REVENUES FROM THEM. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED USING PANEL DATA DRAWN FROM 108 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2011. THE RESULTS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS. THIS STUDY FOUND THAT REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE THE MOST IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL TOURISM FLOWS. IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS MORE IMPACT ON TOURISM IN HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES THAN IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS, DIFFERENT MEASURES OF INTERNATIONAL TOURISM AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.
464	HOW CAN HUMANITARIAN ACTORS OPERATE IN A HOST STATE WITH SIGNIFICANT SUBNATIONAL VARIATIONS IN WILLINGNESS AND CAPACITY TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS? THIS IS AN ISSUE OF PRESSING IMPORTANCE, GIVEN THE EXPANSION OF HUMANITARIAN AID TO MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WITH GROWING STATE CAPACITY, BUT WITH PERSISTENT INFRASTRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN THEIR PERIPHERY. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE CHALLENGES AND POTENTIALITIES OF ENGAGING THESE STATES THROUGH THE CASE STUDY OF THE NORWEGIAN REFUGEE COUNCIL (NRC) IN COLOMBIA. IT DESCRIBES THE WAY THE NRC HAS LOCATED ITS OFFICES IN PERIPHERAL AREAS, AND HOW ITS ACTIVITIES HAVE FOSTERED THE RULE OF LAW, SUCCESSFULLY USING RIGHTS-BASED APPROACHES TO STRENGTHEN SUBNATIONAL STATE INSTITUTIONS, ACTIVATE AND MOBILISE CITIZEN DEMANDS AND BRIDGE NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THESE ACTIVITIES, OPERATED BY OFFICERS WITH EXTENSIVE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOCAL TRUST NETWORKS, CAN OPEN THE WAY FOR DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, BUT CAN ALSO PROVOKE BACKLASH FROM SUBNATIONAL ACTORS.
465	THE STUDY LOOKS INTO HOW GOVERNANCE QUALITIES OF DECENTRALIZED GOVERNMENTS MEDIATE THE IMPACTS OF DECENTRALIZATION ON DEVELOPMENT. BASED ON A SET-ORIENTED APPROACH, THE STUDY ANALYZED DATA FROM A NATION-WIDE SURVEY CONDUCTED WITH BUSINESS MANAGERS FROM ALL PROVINCES IN INDONESIA, AND FOUND EVIDENCE THAT, DESPITE THE COUNTRY'S UNIFORM DECENTRALIZATION REFORM, INDIVIDUAL PROVINCES EXHIBITED GREAT VARIATION IN THE QUALITIES OF THEIR VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES. NOTABLY, THESE QUALITIES ASSUMED NESTED RELATIONS, WITH ORDER AND SECURITY AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW SEEMINGLY BEING THE PRECONDITIONS OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROVISION AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' COORDINATION. MOREOVER, BUSINESS INVESTMENT DECISIONS (MEASURED AS STAFF EXPANSION AND PRODUCT INNOVATION) WERE FOUND TO VARY WITH SOME SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURAL CONDITIONS. THE RESULT PROVIDES EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE ARGUMENT THAT BOTH PHYSICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES ARE INSTRUMENTAL TO REALIZE THE SUPPOSED BENEFITS OF DECENTRALIZATION AND SUPPORTS THE RECENT CALL OF THE LITERATURE TO LOOK INTO THE POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEX IN THE PROCESS OF DECENTRALIZATION REFORM.
466	WE-MEDIA'S INFLUENCE ON JUDICIAL CREDIBILITY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPARENT IN THE CHANGING MODES OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION. INTERPRETATION OF A SAMPLE OF INFLUENTIAL LAWSUITS IN THE LIGHT OF REASON WILL REVEAL THE CORE ELEMENTS SHAPING THE PUBLIC'S JUDGEMENTS ON CRIMINAL CASES, INCLUDING BOTH INTERNAL ELEMENTS CENTERING ON TRUST, REPUTATION AND INTERACTION AND EXTERNAL ELEMENTS CENTERING ON TRANSACTION COSTS. OUR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF TRUST, REPUTATION AND INTERACTION IN THE PUBLIC'S VIEWS ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE PLUS A COMPARISON OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND THAT OF GRASSROOTS LEGAL OFFICIALS REFLECT THE FACT THAT UNDERLYING THESE RATIONAL CHOICES IS THE CLOUDING OF JUDICIAL CREDIBILITY DUE TO CONTRAVENTION OF THE RULES OF JUSTICE. IF WE ARE TO BUILD JUDICIAL CREDIBILITY, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ESTABLISH A SOUND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, A RELATIONSHIP BASED ON UPHOLDING THE IDEA OF RULE OF LAW AND RESPECTING THE RULES OF JUSTICE.
467	SINCE XI JINPING HAS TAKEN OFFICE IN 2012, CHINA'S POLITICAL REPRESSION HAS ONLY BUT INTENSIFIED SO THAT THE REGIME IS DEFINITIVELY TURNING AWAY FROM THE 1990S LEGAL REFORMS AND THE MANY EXPECTATIONS THAT FOLLOWED IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW AND OTHER RIGHTS FOSTERING. IN REPLACING THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN A LARGER PERSPECTIVE INCLUDING THAT OF A "SOCIALIST HARMONIOUS SOCIETY", WHICH HAD ALREADY SHADED A PARTICULAR LIGHT ON CHINESE REFORMS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO ENVISAGE CONTEMPORARY CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE IN AN EVOLUTIONARY AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK. IN DOING SO, IT STRESSES THE TENSIONS BETWEEN A LANGUAGE OF RIGHTS NOW FULLY INTEGRATED BY THE CHINESE CITIZENS AND THE POLITICS OF LAW USED, IN A LAST LEGAL DITCH STRUGGLE, BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AS A TOOL FOR SOCIAL STABILITY IN DISCIPLINING THE PEOPLE BY ALL MEANS INCLUDING BY THE THREAT OF ITS VERY LEGAL CREATIONS. IT THEN CONCLUDES IN REFLECTING UPON THE LEGAL CULTURE EMERGING OUT OF THIS GREAT DIVIDE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE STATE.
468	THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER, WHICH FOLLOWS A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE APPROACH, IS TO ASSESS WHETHER WITHIN COUNTRY CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE (E.G. IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT) AND CHANGES IN CORPORATE OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION CAN PREDICT A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF LATIN AMERICAN FIRMS. USING FIXED-EFFECT PANEL DATA MODELS WITH A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF FIRMS FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1997 TO 2013, WE OBSERVE THAT THE INVESTORS' RIGHTS AND THEIR LEGAL PROTECTION AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PREMIUM IN THE FIRM MARKET VALUE. CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS EXPECTED, IN IMMATURE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AS FOUND IN LATIN AMERICA, FIRMS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BOTH THE ASYMMETRIES OF INFORMATION AND THE MULTIPLE MARKET FRICTIONS TO BE OVERVALUED. SO, AS THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM DEVELOPS, FIRM VALUE DROPS. AT THE FIRM-LEVEL, RESULTS CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXPROPRIATION OF MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
469	CORPORATE OF JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW IS DONE BY A GROUP OF DIRECTORS AS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE CEO ASSIGNMENT BUT CORPORATE OF OTHER FIRMS SUCH CONDUCT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND CAN ALSO PAY A MANAGER TO MANAGE THEM INDIVIDUALLY THAT THIS A GREAT DAMAGE BECAUSE OF HIS INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS CONTRADICT INTERESTS OF THE FIRMS AND DIRECTOR, HE/SHE WILL BE TAKING A PERSONAL INTEREST AND THIS NOT ONLY FOR THE THIRD PARTIES BUT ALSO FOR PARTNERS WILL BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARM AND GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES. THE STUDIES IN THIS PAPER INDICATE THAT THE AUTHORITIES AND DUTIES OF MANAGERS IN JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES IN LAW STATED SEPARATELY BUT ABOUT THE OTHER TRADE, GENERALLY KNOWN AS A LAWYER AND REPRESENTATIVE. MANAGERS OF JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES MUST BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW AND THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' DECISIONS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BUT IN OTHER TRADE FIRMS, MOST OF THE MANAGERS' AUTHORITIES, IS GENERAL.
470	IN 2004, AN OUTBREAK OF OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE IN SEVERAL BATTERY FACTORIES IN SOUTH CHINA LED TO THE CADMIUM POISONING OF HUNDREDS OF WOMEN WORKERS. DRAWING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE WORKS OF ALFRED SCHUTZ AND GIORGIO AGAMBEN, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE LIVES OF CADMIUM-POISONED VICTIMS OFFER AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE CONCEPT OF "STRANGER", WHICH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A SPECIFIC FORM OF "BARE LIFE" IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA. EVIDENCE FROM IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS AND GROUP MEETINGS WITH DOZENS OF VICTIMS REVEALED NOT ONLY THEIR PHYSICAL PAIN, BUT ALSO THEIR EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL ESTRANGEMENT DUE TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING FROM THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS AND THE UPHILL STRUGGLE FOR COMPENSATION. FIELDWORK WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE 2010-12 PERIOD BOTH IN THE HOME VILLAGES/TOWNS TO WHICH VICTIMS HAD RETURNED AND IN GUANGDONG WHERE THEY STAYED BEHIND AND FOUGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS. THE VICTIMS' EXPERIENCE OF SUSTAINED ESTRANGEMENT SHEDS LIGHT ON CONTEMPORARY STATE POWER THAT EXERCISES PREROGATIVE IN SILENCING THE VICTIMS RATHER THAN ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW.
471	FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF LEGAL THEORY, THE PAPER DISTINGUISHES DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES AND REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES. THE FIRSTS ENACT TO PURSUE CONSTITUTIONAL PURPOSES; THE SECONDS ARE BOTH PRINCIPLES IN THE FORM OF ARGUMENTS AND DEFINITE RULES WHICH ARE APPLIED BY SUBSUMPTION. BASIC RIGHTS ARE REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES AS THEY HAVE NATURE BOTH OF ARGUMENTS, AS ALL THE PRINCIPLES, AND OF RULES. IF CONSEQUENTLY THE GREATER PART OF BASIC RIGHTS ARE RULES WHICH ARE APPLIED BY SUBSUMPTION, NORMATIVE CONFLICTS SHOULD BE SOLVED NOT BY BALANCING, BUT BY RECURRING TO CONSTITUTIONAL HIERARCHIES, WHICH THE INTERPRETATIVE ACTIVITY OF JUDGES IDENTIFIES AND DISCOVERS. FROM THIS IT RESULTS THAT ALEXY'S THEORY OF BALANCING IS A WRONG RECONSTRUCTION OF LEGAL REASONING. THIS THEORY FURTHERMORE BRINGS THE DANGER TO SUBTRACT JUDICIAL ACTIVITY TO THE BINDING FORCE OF THE LAW. ONLY BY THIS INTERPRETATION OF BASIC RIGHTS AS REGULATIVE PRINCIPLES IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET THE IDEA OF DIVISION OF POWERS INSIDE THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
472	FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IS A MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION PROBLEM WHERE THE LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY, THE RULE OF LAW, THE GOVERNANCE, THE CORRUPTION AND THE FINANCIAL FREEDOM ARE AMONG THE IMPORTANT CRITERIA TO CONSIDER BEFORE SUCH A DECISION IS MADE. USUALLY, THE COUNTRY PERFORMANCE ON THESE CRITERIA IS CALCULATED BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA AND INDEXES PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. DUE TO THE CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC TRENDS, THE VOLATILE DATA COULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE AN OPTIMAL INVESTMENT DECISION AND THUS EXPERTS' ASSERTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION MAKING METHODOLOGY TO BUILD A RANKING ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE NORTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES (EGYPT, LIBYA, TUNISIA, ALGERIA, MOROCCO AND MAURITANIA) FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL COUNTRIES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS A NOVELTY EXTENDED VERSION OF THE ELECTRE IV WHERE EXPERT'S JUDGMENT ON THE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT IS BASED ON AN IMPRECISE LIKERT SCALE WHICH ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER PARTIAL INFORMATION ON EXPERT'S OPINION.
473	LEGAL MOBILIZATION HAS SPREAD IN CHINA OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS AND IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED BY BOTH ACTIVISTS AND SCHOLARS AS A WAY TO ADVANCE DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. FOCUSING ON THE MOBILIZATION IN FAVOUR OF MIGRANT WORKERS AND ON POLITICALLY MODERATE PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BOTH MORE FREQUENT AND WIDELY HELD AS MORE SUCCESSFUL, I ARGUE TO THE CONTRARY THAT RESISTANCE AND REPRODUCTION OF POLITICAL DOMINATION ARE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE. PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION APPEAR AS NEW FORMS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION THAT CONSTITUTE AN INTERNAL REGULATION TO THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO EXPLAIN THE REGIME'S CAPACITY TO ADAPT AND ITS DURABILITY. THIS ARTICLE ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR NEW STRATEGIES DEVELOPED BY SOME LAWYERS THAT SHUN THE COURTS AND USE LAW TO 'EMPOWER CIVIL SOCIETY' AND THAT THUS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO STRUCTURAL REPRODUCTION. THOUGH ACTIVISTS ARE STRUGGLING TO TURN THEIR STRATEGIES INTO MORE INSTITUTIONALIZED PRACTICES, THEY REMAIN AN AD HOC MECHANISM OF INTERNAL CONTROL.
474	HOW DID POST-COMMUNIST TRANSFORMATIONS AFFECT PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS? WE MODEL A PSEUDO-PANEL WITH 89 COUNTRY-YEAR CLUSTERS, BASED ON THE AGGREGATION OF ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN 14 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1991 AND 2004, TO IDENTIFY THE MACRO AND INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS OF THE PUBLIC OPINION. WE FIND THAT: (I) WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING, ON AVERAGE PEOPLE APPRECIATE MORE EXTENSIVE REFORMS AND DISLIKE UNBALANCED REFORMS. THEY DISLIKE REFORMS WHEN THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT. (II) NOSTALGIA FOR THE PAST REGIME INCREASES WHEN WORSENING INCOME DISTRIBUTION OR HIGHER INFLATION INTERACT WITH MORE PRIVATIZATIONS OF STATE ENTEPRISES. (III) CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE PRESENT AND FUTURE ARE LARGELY EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN THE INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION. (IV) CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN THE EXTENT OF NOSTALGIA TOWARDS THE PAST ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN THE DETERIORATION OF STANDARDS OF LIVING. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
475	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES OF INDIVIDUALISATION AND CONSISTENCY IN SENTENCING. WHILE MOST SENTENCERS ADOPT A PRAGMATIC POSITION BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES, AN "INDIVIDUALIST" APPROACH, EXEMPLIFIED BY AN "INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS" METHODOLOGY IS THE DOMINANT SENTENCING PARADIGM. IT UNDERLIES THE AMBIVALENCE OR ANTIPATHY OF COURTS TO A WIDER USE OF STATISTICS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS APPROACH HAS ENCOURAGED AN UNPREDICTABLE SENTENCING SYSTEM WHICH PRODUCES UNNECESSARY APPEALS AND IS LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE. ACCORDING MORE WEIGHT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSISTENCY BY RECOGNISING APPROPRIATE USES OF STATISTICAL DATA MAY PROMOTE SENTENCING OUTCOMES WHICH REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW WHILE REDUCING UNJUSTIFIED COMPLEXITY IN THE SENTENCING TASK. THIS APPROACH WOULD NOT SACRIFICE DISCRETION TO INDIVIDUALISE SENTENCES BUT WOULD BRING INFORMATION RELATING TO CURRENT SENTENCING PRACTICES TO BEAR ON THE PROCESS OF SENTENCING IN INDIVIDUAL CASES. IN TURN, APPEALS RELATING TO THE MOST COMMON GROUND - MANIFEST EXCESS/LENIENCY - MAY BE REDUCED AND, WHERE THEY AROSE, BE MORE TRANSPARENT.
476	THIS ARTICLE USES A CROSS-COUNTRY ECONOMETRIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE DETERMINANTS FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN AFRICA. THE CONTRIBUTION IS 3-FOLD. FIRSTLY, WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES USED ELSEWHERE, SUCH AS ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES, MAY BE FLAWED. WE THEREFORE USE A DYNARNIC ONE-STEP GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATOR DUE TO ARELLANO AND BOND (1991). THE GMM-ESTIMATES IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF ROBUST DETERMINANTS OF FDI, NAMELY GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION, INFLATION RATE, INVESTMENT, GOVERNANCE (POLITICAL STABILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY BURDEN, RULE OF LAW) AND INITIAL LITERACY. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT GEOGRAPHY DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A DIRECT INFLUENCE ON FDI FLOWS TO AFRICA. NEITHER MARKET-SEEKING NOR RE-EXPORTING MOTIVES OF FDI SEEM TO DOMINATE, WITH DIFFERENT POLICY INSTRUMENTS BEING SIGNIFICANT IN THE DIFFERENT SPECIFICATIONS. THIS DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD POLICIES, BUT PROBABLY INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD POLICIES MADE BY GOOD INSTITUTIONS. INSTITUTIONS, IN THE FORM OF POLITICAL STABILITY SHOWED UP AS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF FDI.
477	THE CRITICS OF PETER BIRKS' INSISTENCE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRAW A MAP OF THE LAW FAIL TO APPRECIATE FULLY WHAT THIS MAPPING IS MEANT TO ACHIEVE. MAPPING THE LAW, PROPERTY UNDERSTOOD, DOES NOT SEEK TO DENY THAT THE LAW IS A DYNAMIC PHENOMENON. WHILE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW NEVER STANDS COMPLETELY STILL, RELIANCE UPON RELATIVELY STABLE CATEGORIES OF RESPONSE-GENERATING EVENTS OUGHT TO REMAIN A KEY FEATURE OF OUR COMMUNITY COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS AS TRUE OF EQUITY AS IT IS OF THE COMMON LAW MAPPING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THESE CATEGORIES IS A MEANS OF MANAGING COMPLEXITY AND ENABLING THE DISSEMINATION OF THE KEY FEATURES OF LEGALLY RELEVANT EVENTS. THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFICULT DISPUTES BEING RESOLVED ACCORDING TO LAW (AS OPPOSED TO THE PERSONAL AUTHORITY OF AN ADJUDICATOR) IS ENHANCED WHERE THE MAJOR CONTOURS OF THE LAW ARE, IN THIS WAY, RENDERED COMMUNICABLE AND INTELLIGIBLE TO ALL.
478	COUNTRIES IN THE THIRD WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION HAVE INTRODUCED COMPETITIVE ELECTIONS BEFORE ESTABLISHING BASIC INSTITUTIONS OF A MODEM STATE SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNORS. BY CONTRAST, COUNTRIES IN THE FIRST WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION BECAME MODERN STATES BEFORE UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE WAS INTRODUCED. BECAUSE THEY HAVE DEMOCRATIZED BACKWARDS, MOST THIRD-WAVE COUNTRIES ARE CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE DEMOCRACIES. INCOMPLETE DEMOCRACIES CAN DEVELOP ILL THREE DIFFERENT WAYS: COMPLETING DEMOCRATIZATION; REPUDIATING FREE ELECTIONS AND TURNING TO AN UNDEMOCRATIC ALTERNATIVE; OR FALLING INTO A LOW-LEVEL EQUILIBRIUM TRAP IN WHICH THE INADEQUACIES OF ELITES ARE MATCHED BY LOW POPULAR DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INCOMPLETE DEMOCRATIZATION IS SHOWN BY ANALYSING PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY DATA FROM THREE NEW DEMOCRACIES VARYING IN THEIR PREDECESSOR REGIMES: THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (A TOTALITARIAN PAST); THE CZECH REPUBLIC (BOTH A DEMOCRATIC AND A TOTALITARIAN PAST) AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA (FORMERLY AN AUTHORITARIAN MILITARY REGIME).
479	THIS IS A PAPER ABOUT THE NEED FOR ALGORITHMIC RIGHTS: THE RIGHT TO ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY AND ALGORITHMIC EXPLAINABILITY; THE RIGHT TO BE INFORMED IF WE ARE INTERACTING WITH AN AUTO-MATED SYSTEM; THE RIGHT NOT TO BE SUBJECT TO A DECISION BASED SOLELY ON AUTOMATED PROCESS-ING; AND THE RIGHT NOT TO DEPEND ON AN ALGORITHMIC SYSTEM FOR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FUNDA-MENTAL RIGHTS, BUT TO INSTEAD CHOOSE HUMAN INTERACTION IN ENSURING SUCH COMPLIANCE. THERE ARE SEVERAL ANGLES FROM WHICH THESE RIGHTS CAN BE DISCUSSED, BUT I WILL BE LOOKING AT THEM AS TOOLS OF EMPOWERMENT SUPPORTING THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION IN THE EU, WHERE THEY CAN HELP US MEET THE CHALLENGE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN AN ALGORITHM-BASED AND DATA-DRIVEN PUBLIC SECTOR, AND CAN IN THIS WAY HELP TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO IT.

480	THIS ARTICLE IS A REFLECTION ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTUALIST THEORIES TO THE FORMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE CURRENT CONCEPTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT IS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WITH REFLECTION FROM A THEORETICAL STUDY AND USES THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUE FROM A HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE PERSPECTIVE. THE APPROACH SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN CONTRACTUALIST THEORIES AND THE NOTION OF RIGHTS AND CITIZENSHIP, THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF STATE AND SOCIETY AND HOW SUCH THEORIES IMPACTED AND STILL IMPACT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS ADMINISTRATION, LIFE OF CITIZENS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL SYSTEM ITSELF, AND ITS RELEVANCE IN THE FEASIBILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND IN CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS A CONSTRUCTION ORIENTED FROM SUCH THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTIONS AND, BASED ON THEM, IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN THIS AREA OF LAW AS AN AREA THAT SEEKS TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE COMPETENCES AND AGAINST STATE ARBITRARINESS.
481	THE COURT OF APPEAL DECISION IN PRIVACY INTERNATIONAL V FOREIGN SECRETARY (2021) FOUND LAWFUL THE LONG-SECRET POLICY GOVERNING THE PURPORTED AUTHORISATION AND COMMISSION OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES AS PART OF THE WORK OF MI5 AND ITS INFORMANTS. THE COURT FOUND MI5 HAD A PUBLIC LAW POWER TO ENGAGE IN SUCH CRIMINALITY, HISTORICALLY UNDER THE ROYAL PREROGATIVE AND MORE LATTERLY AS AN IMPLIED POWER UNDER THE SECURITY SERVICE ACT 1989. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THESE FINDINGS THREATEN SERIOUS DAMAGE TO CORE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW AND SETTLED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE PREROGATIVE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH STATUTE. THEY POSTULATE A MUCH NARROWER IMPLIED LEGAL POWER UNDER THE 1989 ACT, AUTHORISING ONLY THE MAKING OF REPRESENTATIONS TO THE CPS ON WHETHER IT WOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO PROSECUTE. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A NARROW PATH FOR MI5 OFFICERS AND THEIR INFORMANTS TO AVOID LEGAL JEOPARDY FOR ACTIVITIES CORE TO ITS MISSION.
482	WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF DIGITAL DATA, DATA MINING (DM)-IN THE SENSE OF THE DISCOVERY OF VALUABLE STRUCTURES IN LARGE SETS OF DATA-IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF MANY TYPES OF RESEARCH. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES HOW COPYRIGHT AFFECTS DM BY ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS. IN SOME TERRITORIES, ACADEMIC DM IS LAWFUL IF RESEARCHERS HAVE LAWFUL ACCESS TO INPUT WORKS. IN OTHER TERRITORIES SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, LAWFUL DM ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES SPECIFIC CONSENT BY RIGHTS HOLDERS. BASED ON BIBLIOMETRIC DATA AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH DESIGNS, WE SHOW THAT WHERE ACADEMIC DM REQUIRES SPECIFIC RIGHTS HOLDER CONSENT: (1) DM PUBLICATIONS MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SHARE OF TOTAL RESEARCH OUTPUT, AND (2) STRONGER RULE OF LAW IS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS DM RESEARCH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EMPIRICALLY DOCUMENT AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) ON INNOVATION UNDER PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT COPYRIGHT EXCEPTIONS OR LIMITATIONS PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF DM RESEARCH.
483	ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRES CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE SECURE EXCHANGE. BUT WHEN STATES SELECTIVELY ENFORCE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS CAN MODERATE THE TRUST THAT BUYERS HAVE IN SELLERS. I ARGUE THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS PRODUCE MORAL HAZARD IN EXCHANGE BECAUSE THEY INTRODUCE BIASES IN EXPECTATIONS OF JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT. BUYERS AVOID TRADE WITH POLITICALLY CONNECTED SELLERS, AND, IN THIS CONTEXT OF UNEQUAL ENFORCEMENT, FORMAL CONTRACTS DISPROPORTIONATELY PROTECT POLITICALLY CONNECTED BUYERS. TO EXAMINE THESE FEATURES OF CONNECTIONS AND CONTRACTS, I CREATED A SALES BUSINESS IN SENEGAL AND RANDOMIZED WHETHER EMPLOYEES SIGNALED POLITICAL CONNECTIONS AND/OR OFFERED FORMAL CONTRACTS DURING TRANSACTIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT POLITICAL CONNECTIONS DECREASED BUYERS' WILLINGNESS TO EXCHANGE. FORMAL CONTRACTS INCREASED EXCHANGE, THOUGH PRIMARILY FOR CONNECTED BUYERS. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ASYMMETRIC POLITICAL CONNECTIONS CAN IMPEDE DAILY TRADE AND INTENSIFY ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN DEVELOPING CONTEXTS, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEMONSTRATING THE LIMITS OF STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR MITIGATING POLITICALLY DRIVEN MORAL HAZARD.
484	WITH A MEDIAN AGE ESTIMATED AT 18 YEARS, EAST AFRICA IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST REGIONS IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND WHAT VALUES AND NORMS SHAPE OR INFLUENCE THEM. ABOUT 7,000 INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGE OF 18 AND 35 WERE INTERVIEWED IN KENYA, TANZANIA, RWANDA AND UGANDA. YOUTH CONSTRUCTED THEIR IDENTITY ALONG FOUR DIMENSIONS; YOUTH (AGE-ASSOCIATED); NATIONALITY; FAITH; FAMILY. HOWEVER, COUNTRY, RELIGION, GENDER AND AGE INFLUENCED THE ORDERING OF IDENTITY. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RWANDA, EAST AFRICAN A TOLERANCE FOR RULE VIOLATION AND CORRUPTION WAS PREVALENT AMONG EAST AFRICAN YOUTH. THIS DIFFERENCE OFFERS HOPE BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES THAT RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, UNEQUIVOCAL COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE ENFORCED AND TRANSMITTED TO THE NEXT GENERATION, THE YOUTH. VALUES AND NORMS ARE SHAPED BY AND CO-EVOLVE WITH INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS OF THE WIDER SOCIETY.
485	IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, MEXICO HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO FURTHER PREVENTION, PROTECTION, AND PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS. THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNMENT HAS SIGNED INTERNATIONAL ANTI TRAFFICKING CONVENTIONS AND HAS TAKEN SOME ASPECTS OF WIDELY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF THIS CRIME AS A REFERENCE WHEN DRAFTING ITS ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION. HOWEVER, MEXICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE INTERPRETED HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THEIR OWN TERMS. MEXICO'S CURRENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION IS BASED ON A QUITE BROAD DEFINITION OF TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND SHOWS SERIOUS LIMITATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO THE MISIDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKERS, AS WELL AS TO RE-VICTIMIZATION. THIS ADDS TO MEXICO'S WEAK RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF INTEREST GROUPS WITH PARTICULAR AGENDAS/IDEOLOGIES THAT HAVE OBSTRUCTED REFORM. THE PRESENT ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THE IMPERATIVE NECESSITY TO MODIFY THE CURRENT ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION IN MEXICO AND PROVIDES SOME BASIC SUGGESTIONS FOR THIS MUCH-NEEDED REFORM.
486	IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE REGIONAL IMPACTS OF THE 1997 ASIAN CRISIS ON GOVERNANCE. WE USE WORLD BANK'S WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (I.E. WGI) WHICH INCLUDES SIX DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE. THESE SIX DIMENSIONS ARE "VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY", "POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE", "GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS", "REGULATORY QUALITY", "RULE OF LAW", AND "CONTROL OF CORRUPTION". THE SEVEN REGIONS THAT WE EXAMINE ARE NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN, EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC, SOUTH ASIA, SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, AND MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT, DUE TO THE CRISIS, WHILE THE OVERALL RANKINGS OF LATIN AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN, AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IMPROVED, THE OVERALL RANKINGS OF EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC, SOUTH ASIA, AND MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA DECLINED. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE RANKING OF NORTH AMERICA DUE TO THE CRISIS. BOTH PRE- AND POST-CRISIS, NORTH AMERICA HAS THE HIGHEST RANKING IN ALL SIX MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE.
487	IS THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM (DSS) IS A SUITABLE MODEL FOR INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES ARISING UNDER EUROPEAN UNION FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (EU FTAS)? ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO REPLICATE THE SYSTEM HAVE FAILED AT THE MULTILATERAL LEVEL, THE DSS IS HIGHLY SUITABLE TO THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE EU. FIRST, THE WTO HAS HELPED CREATE AN INTEGRATIVE SYSTEM, INVOLVING ALL STAKEHOLDERS, I.E. DISPUTANTS, STATES, AND THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF. SECOND, A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF THE DSS SHOWS THAT IT IS STRONGLY FOCUSED ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND NOT MERELY ON LITIGATION. FINALLY, UNLIKE INVESTMENT ARBITRATION, THE DSS HAS SEEMINGLY PRESERVED THE RULE OF LAW BY ALLOWING APPEALS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE APPELLATE BODY HAS GRADUALLY DEVELOPED INTO A 'REBELLIOUS' JUDICIARY, IMMUNE FROM POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. TRANSFERRING THESE KEY INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES TO THE INVESTMENT SPHERE WOULD NOT ONLY CONSTITUTE STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM BUT ALSO PROVIDE THE EU WITH AN INSTRUMENT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.
488	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PHENOMENON OF POLITICIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THREE OF ITS ASPECTS ARE IDENTIFIED AND INVESTIGATED: THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL REVOLUTIONS ON THE RULE OF LAW; THE PROBLEM OF LUSTRATION OF STATE EMPLOYEES; AND THE DEEPENING OF THE POLITICIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY. SOCIAL REVOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THE UKRAINIAN 2013-2014 SOCIAL REVOLUTION, ARE VIEWED AS A CONCEPT THAT CAN HAVE A DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON THE REFORM OF THE STATE MECHANISM AND, IN MANY WAYS, DETERMINE ITS FUTURE DESTINY. THE LUSTRATION PROCEDURE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE-A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE THAT STUDIES THE FUNCTIONING OF JUSTICE IN TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRACIES, UNDERGOES SPECIAL RESEARCH HEREIN. THE CLASSIFICATION OF LUSTRATION ACCORDING TO VARIOUS CRITERIA IS GIVEN. THE ARTICLE ALSO SHOWS THE PRACTICE OF A NUMBER OF STATES WHOSE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS FALL UNDER THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL JUSTICE. A SHOCKING CONCLUSION IS DRAWN THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ACQUITTALS IN NAZI GERMANY FOR NON-POLITICAL CRIMES WAS HIGHER THAN IN MODERN RUSSIA OR UKRAINE.
489	IT IS SETTLED THAT PARLIAMENT CANNOT FORMALLY DENY THE HIGH COURT ITS JURISDICTION TO REVIEW FOR JURISDICTIONAL ERROR UNDER S 75(V) OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR THE EXTENT TO WHICH PARLIAMENT CAN FUNCTIONALLY REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THIS JURISDICTION THROUGH NO-INVALIDITY CLAUSES OR OTHER DRAFTING MECHANISMS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A "THIN" VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, NAMELY NON-ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, WOULD PROVIDE THE LEAST CONTROVERSIAL, AND THEREFORE THE MOST ROBUST, FOUNDATION TO DEFINE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE HIGH COURT'S JURISDICTION UNDER S 75(V). THIS IS BECAUSE THE PROPOSITION THAT S 75(V) ENTRENCHES THE VALUE OF NON-ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST APPROACHES TO CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. THIS ARTICLE ALSO RECOGNISES HOW A NUMBER OF ENTRENCHED COMMON LAW CONCEPTS WILL LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE HIGH COURT'S JURISDICTION UNDER S 75(V) BUT DEMONSTRATES HOW THE VALUE OF NONARBITRARY GOVERNMENT CAN BE RECONCILED WITH THESE LIMITS VIA A RULE VERSUS STANDARD ANALYSIS.
490	DECENTRALIZED DECISIONS AMONG GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CAN CAUSE DRAMATIC INCONSISTENCIES IN BUREAUCRATIC DECISION MAKING. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYNTHETIC REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF BUREAUCRATIC DECISIONS AND REDUCING SUCH STREET-LEVEL ARBITRARINESS. FIRST, WE OFFER A TYPOLOGY TO UNIFY QUALITY ASSURANCE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES OFTEN TREATED IN DISTINCT SCHOLARLY LITERATURES. THIS SYNTHESIS REVEALS COMMON CHALLENGES BUT ALSO POINTS TO NOVEL HYBRID SOLUTIONS THAT BORROW ACROSS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. SECOND, ALTHOUGH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS LIMITED, OUR REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT ONGOING MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MONITORING, PEER REVIEW, AND PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE, ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN EX POST TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS AUDITS AND APPEALS. THIRD, PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND PAY EXACERBATE THE QUANTITY-QUALITY TRADE-OFF LONG OPINED ABOUT IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. WE OFFER SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE DIRECTIONS-MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE VITAL ROLE OF ACADEMIC-AGENCY RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS IN CRAFTING QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS-TO ADDRESS THIS ENDEMIC CHALLENGE TO BUREAUCRACY AND RULE OF LAW.
491	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CROATIAN AND MONTENEGRIN EU ACCESSION PATH AS A TWO-SIDED DISCIPLINING PROCESS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS. THE "SUCCESS" OF THE EU'S CIVILISING MISSION IN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS DETERMINED THROUGH THE FEEDBACK/DIALOGUE RELATIONSHIP FORMED BETWEEN THE EU AND THE CANDIDATE COUNTRY. I ANALYSE TWO ASPECTS OF THE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS: COOPERATION WITH THE ICTY AND THE RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS. IN CROATIA, THE DOMESTIC ELITES' DETERMINATION TO ENSURE THE MEMBERSHIP PAIRED UP WITH THE EU'S CIVILISING MISSION IN THE BALKANS. IN MONTENEGRO, THE EU MEMBERSHIP HAS NOT OUTRIGHT REPRESENTED THE MYTHICAL RETURN TO EUROPE, HENCE INITIALLY SELF-CIVILISING WAS NOT HIGH ON THE LIST OF THE PRIORITIES. MOREOVER, MONTENEGRO WAS THE SUCCESS STORY OF THE BALKANS AND THE EU INITIALLY DID NOT INSIST ON THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE WIDER EU ENLARGEMENT LITERATURE BY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZING THE CULTURAL STUDIES FRAMEWORK AND BY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OVERLOOKED FEEDBACK/DIALOGUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ACCESSION PROCESS.
492	THE PACE OF CAPITAL ACCUMULATION IN EAST ASIA HAS SIMPLY BEEN STUNNING. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE SOURCES OF THIS FAST ACCUMULATION AND MAKE PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. WE ESTIMATE A "CONVERGENCE" EQUATION FOR PHYSICAL CAPITAL PER CAPITA, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM AN OPEN ECONOMY GROWTH MODEL, USING A POOLED CROSS-COUNTRY, ACROSS-DECADE SAMPLE OF THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE ALSO CONDUCT PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT TWO DECADES. WE FIND THAT AN ECONOMY WITH A LOW LEVEL OF CAPITAL STOCK PER CAPITA TENDS TO EXPERIENCE FASTER ACCUMULATION SUBSEQUENTLY. ASIAN ECONOMIES HAVE CERTAINLY BENEFITED FROM THIS "CONVERGENCE EFFECT". BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS A LOW RULE OF LAW SCORE AND HIGH INVESTMENT GOODS PRICES HAVE WORKED AGAINST THEM. OUR PROJECTION SHOWS THAT, IF THOSE ECONOMIES WISH TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT PACE OF FAST CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, THE KEYS WOULD BE TO REDUCE DISTORTIONS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS.

493	ESTABLISHED CONCEPTS AND METHODS THAT TAKE CRIME AS A REFERENCE POINT TO STUDY FEAR OF CRIME AND PUNITIVENESS ARE CONSIDERED TOO NARROW TO UNDERSTAND THE BROADER BACKGROUND MOTIVES OF THESE PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES IT CAN NOW BE SHOWN THAT SOCIAL CHANGE AND SOCIAL PROTEST - COUPLED WITH A RISING CONSCIOUSNESS OF RISK BROUGHT ON BY AN INSECURE - WORLD CREATE OVERARCHING FEELINGS OF ANXIETY AND INSECURITY AMONG INDIVIDUALS INTO WHICH FEAR OF CRIME IS SUBSUMED AS RISK IS NEITHER A FACT NOR A THING BUT RATHER "A WAY OF THINKING", IT IS APPLIED TO ALL SORTS OF POSSIBLE THOUGH UNKNOWN CATASTROPHES AND IS THE INSPIRATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MASSIVE PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MEET THE UNKNOWN THE PURPORTED RISK POSED BY TERRORISM AND OTHER KINDS OF CRIME HAS MEANT THAT PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN USED TO SERIOUSLY RESTRICT CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS OTHERWISE GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION, TO THE POINT THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS LITTLE BY LITTLE BEING REPLACED BY A "GOVERNANCE THROUGH RISK".
494	WE DISCUSS POLITICAL ECONOMY MECHANISMS WHICH CAN EXPLAIN THE RESOURCE CURSE, IN WHICH AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF RESOURCE RENTS CAUSES A DECREASE IN THE ECONOMY'S TOTAL VALUE ADDED. WE IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH RESOURCE RENTS WILL ALTER THE INCENTIVES OF A POLITICAL LEADER. SOME OF THESE INDUCE GREATER INVESTMENT BY THE LEADER IN ASSETS THAT FAVOUR GROWTH (INFRASTRUCTURE, RULE OF LAW, ETC.), OTHERS LEAD TO A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC DROP IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, THE EFFECT OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE CAN BE HIGHLY NON-MONOTONIC. WE ARGUE THAT IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW RESOURCES AFFECT THE LEADER'S 'SURVIVAL FUNCTION', I.E. THE REDUCED-FORM PROBABILITY OF RETAINING POWER. WE ALSO BRIEFLY SURVEY DECENTRALIZED MECHANISMS, IN WHICH RENTS INDUCE A REALLOCATION OF LABOUR BY PRIVATE AGENTS, CROWDING OUT PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY MORE THAN PROPORTIONATELY. WE ARGUE THAT THESE MECHANISMS CANNOT BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUSLY STUDYING LEADER BEHAVIOUR.
495	INGLEHART AND NORRIS ARGUE THAT THE CORE CLASH BETWEEN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND THE WEST IS OVER ISSUES CONCERNING GENDER EQUALITY RATHER THAN DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, A COMPARISON BETWEEN ARAB AND NON-ARAB MUSLIM SOCIETIES IS ESSENTIAL BEFORE DRAWING THIS CONCLUSION. HERE, WE COMPARED NATIONS FROM EACH SOCIETY AND FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES TOWARD GENDER EQUALITY, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND RELIGIOUS IDENTITIES. WE ANALYZED MODELS PREDICTING SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY INCLUDING VIEWS TOWARD GENDER EQUALITY IN EACH SET OF COUNTRIES. IN NON-ARAB MUSLIM COUNTRIES, THERE WERE HIGHER LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, AND THOSE WHO SUPPORTED GENDER EQUALITY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY. THE REVERSE WAS TRUE IN THE ARAB MUSLIM COUNTRIES. WE ARGUE THAT FOR A COMPLETE AND UNBIASED FORM OF DEMOCRACY TO EMERGE IN THE ARAB MIDDLE EAST, A RULE OF LAW THAT WOULD PROTECT GENDER EQUALITY, MINORITY RIGHTS AND CITIZEN INCLUSION WOULD NEED TO BE INSTITUTED.
496	ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT ENCOMPASSES ALL GOVERNMENT ROLES AND ACTIVITIES, SHAPED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS). GOING WELL BEYOND ANALOGIES TO E-COMMERCE, IT ENCOMPASSES THE FOUR DOMAINS OF GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE STATE'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAMS; ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITIZEN AND THE RULE OF LAW (E-DEMOCRACY), ITS INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT E-GOVERNMENT BUILDS ON THREE EVOLVING FORCES: TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND GOVERNMENT ITSELF. IT HAS GIVEN RISE TO SEVERAL PHENOMENA THAT ARE REDEFINING THE PUBLIC SECTOR ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES. FOUR ASPECTS OF E-GOVERNMENT HAVE LASTING IMPACTS ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: CITIZEN-CENTERED SERVICE, INFORMATION AS A PUBLIC RESOURCE, NEW SKILLS AND WORKING RELATIONSHIPS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND MANAGEMENT MODELS. THE CHALLENGES OF E-GOVERNMENT ARE EVEN MORE ACUTE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO OFFERS SOLUTIONS. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN ALL COUNTRIES REQUIRES NEW THINKING AND LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT E-GOVERNMENT REALIZES ITS FULL POTENTIAL.
497	THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY VERIFIES RECENT EFFORTS OF EU POLICYMAKERS AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES TO APPLY THE EUROPEAN COHESION POLICY (ECP) AS A POSSIBLE COUNTER-CYCLICAL INSTRUMENT TO BOOST ECONOMIES IN THEIR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. COMPARED TO LIMITED COUNTRY-SPECIFIC STUDIES, WE ALLOW FOR AN ENDOGENEITY ISSUE BETWEEN THE BUSINESS CYCLES AND THE ECP PAYMENTS AND APPLY A SYSTEM GMM ESTIMATION FOR THE EU-28 RECIPIENT COUNTRIES SAMPLE IN THE TIME PERIOD 2000 2018. EVEN THOUGH THE OVERALL ECP PAYMENTS FOLLOW A PRO-CYCLICAL PATH, THE MODEL ESTIMATIONS FOR THE SUB-PERIODS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMING PERIODS REVEAL A TIME-VARYING CYCLICAL CHARACTER OF THE ECP. WHEREAS THE OBSERVED PROCYCLICALITY CAN BE MAINLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PERIOD 2000 - 2006, WE FIND THE CONDITIONAL COUNTER-CYCLICAL EFFECTS IN 2007 - 2013 AND 2014 - 2018, WHEN A LOWER PRICE LEVEL AND OBEYING THE RULE OF LAW SEEM TO HAVE AN EXTRA COUNTER-CYCLICAL DIMENSION, CONFIRMING A RATIONALE OF THE CONVERGENCE CRITERIA AND THE STABILITY AND THE GROWTH PACT.
498	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS NEWS COVERAGE OF SOUTH AFRICA AS IT RELATES TO THE CONTINUOUS OCCURRENCE OF XENOPHOBIA IN THE COUNTRY. THROUGH PURPOSELY SELECTED NEWS VIDEOS UPLOADED ON YOUTUBE, THE PAPER ADOPTS A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS RESEARCH METHOD GUIDED BY THE KEY WORDS 'SOUTH AFRICAN LEADERS, ELECTION SPEECH, XENOPHOBIA'. THIRTEEN VIDEOS WERE PURPOSIVELY SELECTED AND TRANSCRIBED FROM A LIST OF 18 VIDEOS DRAWN FROM THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF THE KEYWORD SEARCH ON . USING VAN DIJK'S IDEOLOGICAL SQUARE, THE QUALITATIVE DATA GENERATED INDICATE NARRATIVES THAT SPEAK TO IDEOLOGIES BINDING SOUTH AFRICANS TOGETHER AS A 'WE' AGAINST THE MIGRANT 'THEM'. THE BINDING 'WE' FACTORS INCLUDE THE HISTORICAL BLACK STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION, THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW. QUALITIES FOR 'THEM' (WHICH THE NARRATIVES SUGGEST SPARK XENOPHOBIA) INCLUDE VARIOUS PERCEIVED ACTS OF IMMIGRANT CRIMINALITY; THE RESULT OF WHICH IS ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND NEGATIVE INFLUENCES ON THE SOUTH AFRICAN PEOPLE.
499	WHILE THERE IS EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ON STATES AND KNOWLEDGE, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE FOCUS ON STATE IGNORANCE: INSTANCES WHERE STATES ARE IDENTIFIED AS LACKING KNOWLEDGE RELEVANT TO ADDRESSING SOCIAL PROBLEMS. WE PRESENT THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF HOW STATES PERCEIVE AND RESPOND TO IGNORANCE, DEVELOPING A TYPOLOGY OF RESPONSES (DENIAL, RESIGNATION, AND ELUCIDATION). WE TEST AND REFINE THE TYPOLOGY THROUGH ANALYZING STATE IGNORANCE OF UNAUTHORIZED MIGRATION IN GERMANY AND THE UK, 1990-2006. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES RESPONDED TO IGNORANCE THROUGH BOTH DENIAL AND RESIGNATION. HOWEVER, VARIATIONS IN CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURES AND BUREAUCRATIC CULTURES MEANT THAT "RESIGNATION" TOOK DISTINCT FORMS. IN THE UK, PRAGMATISM ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS OF STATE CAPACITY IMPLIED THAT OFFICIALS WERE SANGUINE ABOUT THEIR "IGNORANCE," WITH PRESSURE EMANATING FROM EXTERNAL POLITICAL SCRUTINY. IN GERMANY, BY CONTRAST, OFFICIALS FACED AN ACUTE CONFLICT BETWEEN BUREAUCRATIC AND LEGAL NORMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONSTRAINTS TO ENFORCEMENT. BOTH CASES REVEAL PROFOUND STATE AMBIVALENCE ABOUT ELUCIDATING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OVER WHICH THEY HAVE LIMITED CONTROL.
500	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES CAN BRING MUCH-NEEDED JOBS TO REMOTE LOCATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE TOO MANY EXAMPLES WHERE EXTRACTIVE PROJECTS BRING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. SOME RESEARCH HAS POINTED OUT THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN EXTRACTIVE PROJECT THAT BRINGS POSITIVE SPILLOVERS FOR COMMUNITIES AND ONE THAT DESTROYS COMMUNITIES AND POISONS THE ENVIRONMENT IS A STRONG RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OFTEN LACK STRONG LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION. FURTHERMORE, REMOTE LOCATIONS ARE USUALLY THE LAST SAFE HAVEN FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS STRICKEN BY POVERTY. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT, GIVEN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, HOME STATES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO MORE TO CONTROL THEIR OUTWARD INVESTORS, PARTICULARLY REGARDING EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES. THE ESSAY CONCENTRATES MOSTLY ON CANADIAN MINING COMPANIES GIVEN THE PLURALITY OF CONFLICTS INVOLVING THEM AND A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. THE ESSAY WILL ALSO ANALYZE CURRENT EFFORTS AT THE HOME STATE LEVEL TO REIN-IN THE CONDUCT OF EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES ABROAD AND ADVISE WHERE THEY MAY FALL SHORT.
501	AS THE EMERGENT USER-CENTRIC VISION OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS GAINING GROUND WORLDWIDE, THE TRADITIONAL LEGAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION CULTURE WILL BE CALLED TO EVOLVE AND JUDGING FUNCTIONS WILL BE CHALLENGED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THIS CULTURAL SHIFT IN CANADA. PROBLEM-SOLVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE NOW REQUIRES TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LITIGANTS AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS A CORNERSTONE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE ARGUMENT FROM THE JUDGE'S POINT OF VIEW. WE PUT FORTH THAT THE CANADIAN JUDGE IS NOW FACING THREE CHALLENGES WHEN DELIVERING JUSTICE: FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN TRUTH AND ACCESSIBILITY, ARBITRATING BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS AND SUPPORTING LITIGANTS WITH APPROPRIATE COEQUAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES. THROUGH THE LENS OF "SINGLE AND DOUBLE LOOP LEARNING", WE EXPLORE HOW THE JUDGE CAN FURTHER EFFICIENCY-DRIVEN STRATEGIES TO EMBRACE A RENEWED JUSTICIAL ROLE IN PROBLEM-SOLVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
502	FROM ITS INCEPTION INTO THE HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE, THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT (RTD) HAS BEEN CONTENTIOUS. NEVERTHELESS, AS RESULT OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF THE UN DECLARATION ON IT, THE RTD IS NOW A FAIT ACCOMPLI. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR ITS EFFECTIVE REALIZATION AND SUSTAINABILITY. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, STATES SHOULD ADOPT CONSTITUTIONALISM CHARACTERIZED BY SEPARATION OF POWERS AND RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW AND ADOPT HUMAN CENTERED DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, STATES SHOULD COOPERATE IN ADOPTING RESPONSIVE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND ENSURE THAT THESE POLICIES AS WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AT LARGE ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE REALIZATION OF THE RTD. SIMILARLY, TRANSNATIONAL COMPANIES SHOULD PLAY THEIR ROLE. IN THESE ENDEAVORS AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, GIVEN THE RELUCTANCE OF THE GLOBAL POWERS TO THE RTD, CHINA SHOULD USE ITS INFLUENCE IN THE G8, G20, AND THE BRICS TO PERSUADE OTHER POWERFUL STAKEHOLDERS TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE RTD.
503	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE OPPOSITE STANCES TAKEN BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ), THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) AND THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. ON THE ONE HAND, THE ICJ AND THE ECTHR RELIED ON THE EXISTENCE OF A CUSTOMARY RULE OF STATE IMMUNITY AS HIERARCHICALLY PREVAILING - EITHER IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER AS A JUS COGENS RULE OR IN STATE CONSTITUTIONS - OVER ANY COMMITMENTS TO HUMAN RIGHTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CONSIDERED THE NORMATIVE WEIGHT OF THE CONFLICTING PRINCIPLES AT STAKE. WHILE ACTING AS A GATEKEEPER OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, THE COURT DID NOT DISREGARD NORMATIVE IMPERATIVES STEMMING FROM INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EVENTUALLY STUCK A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LEGAL ORDERS ON A SUBSTANTIVE AND CONTEXTUAL BASIS. IN SO DOING, IT ENCOURAGED AN INNOVATIVE, COHERENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A WHOLE, ONE THAT THE ICJ WAS UNABLE TO CONSIDER.
504	THIS ARTICLE IS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE RIGHTS PROVIDED BY THE ARTICLE 47 OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION: THE RIGHT OF A FAIR TRIAL. IT IS NOT A NEW CONTRIBUTION OF THE CHARTER BUT A GUARANTEE WHICH HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY THE EU LAW FOR DECADES, FIRST APPEARED AS PROCEDURAL RIGHT, LATER RECOGNIZED AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF THE EU AND FINALLY EMBODIED IN THE CHARTER. THIS WORK REMINDS SUCH PROCESS OF RECOGNITION, PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE JUDICIAL REMEDIES PROVIDED BY THE EU LAW AND TO SOME SPECIFIC RULES WHICH AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE RIGHT OF A FAIR TRIAL IS DEVELOPED. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES UNDERLINING, ON ONE HAND, THE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL CARRIED OUT BY THIS LEGAL PROCESS AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, A FEW GAPS ON THE ISSUE WHICH ARE NEITHER RECENT NOR CONSISTENT WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COMPLETENESS OF SUCH RIGHT AS IT IS REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW TRADITION.
505	THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GUANXI OR PERSONAL CONNECTIONS IN CHINESE MANAGEMENT, ITS CONTRIBUTION TO TRUST IN BUSINESS DEALINGS, AND ITS RELATION TO ETHICAL JUDGEMENT IN CHINESE MANAGEMENT. THE PAPER BEGINS WITH A BACKGROUND TO THE TERM GUANXI WHERE IT ARGUES THAT PERSONAL CONNECTIONS WOULD BE AN ADEQUATE AND PREFERABLE TERM FOR GUANXI, SINCE ALTHOUGH THE PHENOMENON IN PRACTICE IS SPECIFIC TO CHINA IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO CHINA. GUANXI OR PERSONAL CONNECTIONS IN CHINA SHOULD BE SEEN AS PART OF CHINA'S TRADITIONAL CULTURE, BUT WITHOUT ATTACHING A MYSTICAL VALUE TO THE CONCEPT. UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON AND AWARENESS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH CHINESE BUSINESS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO TRUST BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND IN FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS. HOWEVER IT IS THROUGH A GRASP OF ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND A DEEPER AWARENESS OF MORALITY THAT PERSONAL CONNECTIONS CAN BE SOUNDLY BASED AND GOES BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW TO MEET CHINA'S POTENTIAL FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC SUCCESS.
506	DEPENDING ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENT IS INTERPRETED AS A PUBLIC GOOD, SURROUNDED BY A COMPLEX PROTECTIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, IN WHICH THE ISSUE OF SUPPRESSION OF NATIVE VEGETATION ON SPECIALLY PROTECTED AREAS ACQUIRES GREAT RELEVANCE. ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE WHEN, IN THE LEGAL AND DOCTRINAL ENVIRONMENT, DIFFERENT POSITIONS RELATIVE TO REGRAMENTO OF LAW. 12.651/2012 (NEW BRAZILIAN FOREST CODE). IN PARTICULAR, REGARDING THE MATTER OF THE REMOVAL OF VEGETATION IN PERMANENT PRESERVATION AREAS, WHOSE ILLUSTRATIVE LIST OF HYPOTHESES UTILITIES, SOCIAL INTEREST AND LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, GIVES BANKS THE BRINGING OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIMITS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL PROTECTION CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THEREFORE, THE RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE CONFLICTING POINTS AND PREVAILING NORMS AND ATTITUDES THAT CAN BE EQUATED TO THE SOLUTION OF IRREGULARITIES OR OMISSIONS OF PATERNAL NORMATIVE SYSTEM. TO THIS END, EMBRACING LEGAL, DOCTRINAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL, BASE IS USED BECAUSE, APPLIED THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD, UNDER THE BIAS OF A LEGAL-DOGMATIC PERSPECTIVE.
507	WHAT KIND OF CONSTITUTION IS EMERGING IN EUROPE? THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION. THE FIRST, A FOUNDATIONAL' APPROACH, REJECTS THE PREMISE: THERE CAN BE NO REAL CONSTITUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF A DEMOS', A FOUNDATION WHICH EXISTS ONLY NATIONALLY. THE SECOND, FREESTANDING' APPROACH, DEPICTS IT AS PARADIGMATIC OF A BROADER PHENOMENON OF COSMOPOLITAN CONSTITUTIONALISM, BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS GUARANTEED THROUGH A TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. REJECTING BOTH FOR THEIR FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AS A HISTORICAL PROCESS OF POLITY-BUILDING, A THIRD APPROACH, POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM', IS PROPOSED, CAPTURING THE DYNAMIC QUALITY OF CONSTITUTIONALISATION IN THE EU. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, WHAT IS EMERGING IN EUROPE IS A CONSTITUTION THAT REFLECTS A COMMON GOOD (PREDOMINANTLY CONCEIVED IN ECONOMIC TERMS), ALBEIT ONE WHICH IS LEGALLY, POLITICAL AND SOCIALLY CONTESTED. IT IS BY CAPTURING THIS COMPLEX PICTURE OF THE POLITICAL FORMATION OF EUROPE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION WILL BE MOST FRUITFULLY PURSUED.
508	BY FOCUSING ON THE INTERSECTION OF RECURRING UNIVERSES BETWEEN EDUARDO SACHERI'S LA PREGUNTA DE SUS OJOS (THE QUESTION IN THEIR EYES) AND ITS ADAPTION IN JUAN JOSE CAMPANELLA'S THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES (EL SECRET DE SUS OJOS), THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE PERSISTENCE OF CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF "PERVERSE FASCINATION" THAT THE FILM, UNLIKE THE BOOK ON WHICH IT IS BASED, TRIES TO PROVOKE IN ITS AUDIENCE. IT ANALYSES THE DISCURSIVE LINKS WITH A LANGUAGE MARKED BY A POLITICAL TENSION THAT EVIDENCES THE FAILURE OF A SOCIAL SYSTEM THAT SEEMS TO PLACE ITS COMMUNITY BEYOND THE CIVILIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES OF REASON (AGAMBEN 100). BRIEFLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE THRILLER EXPLORED IN CAMPANELLA'S FILM SERVES THE ARGENTINE DIRECTOR TO SPREAD THE IDEA OF NEW SOCIAL IMAGINARIES THAT PERPETUATE, BY A MELODRAMATIC IMAGINATION, THE PERCEPTION OF A CURRENT CHAOTIC COMMUNITY WITH NO PLACE FOR JUSTICE AND WHERE THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME UNNECESSARY.
509	LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER-BOTH ITS IDEAS AND REAL-WORLD POLITICAL FORMATIONS-IS NOT EMBODIED IN A FIXED SET OF PRINCIPLES OR PRACTICES. OPEN MARKETS, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, COOPERATIVE SECURITY, DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY, PROGRESSIVE CHANGE, COLLECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING, THE RULE OF LAW-THESE ARE ASPECTS OF THE LIBERAL VISION THAT HAVE MADE APPEARANCES IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS AND CHANGING WAYS OVER THE LAST CENTURY. I ARGUE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THREE VERSIONS OR MODELS OF LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER-VERSIONS 1.0, 2.0, AND 3.0. THE FIRST IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDEAS OF WOODROW WILSON, THE SECOND IS THE COLD WAR LIBERAL INTERNATIONALISM OF THE POST-1945 DECADES, AND THE THIRD VERSION IS A SORT OF POST-HEGEMONIC LIBERAL INTERNATIONALISM THAT HAS ONLY PARTIALLY APPEARED AND WHOSE FULL SHAPE AND LOGIC IS STILL UNCERTAIN. I DEVELOP A SET OF DIMENSIONS THAT ALLOW FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT LOGICS OF LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND IDENTIFY VARIABLES THAT WILL SHAPE THE MOVEMENT FROM LIBERAL INTERNATIONALISM 2.0 TO 3.0.
510	THE EMERGENCE OF CRIMINAL SECRET SOCIETIES IN POST-MAO CHINA HAS CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THE CRIMINAL SUBCULTURES, MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT, IMPOVERISHMENT, ECONOMIC INEQUALITY, RELATIVE DEPRIVATION, AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION THAT HAVE ARISEN FROM THE REFORM PROCESS. ALTHOUGH PERCEIVED AS THE ROOTS OF ORGANIZED CRIME WORLDWIDE, THESE VARIABLES HAVE GENERATED CRIME INCENTIVES - MAINLY AMONG DISADVANTAGED AND MARGINALIZED SOCIAL GROUPS-FAR STRONGER IN CHINA THAN IN MOST OF WESTERN SOCIETIES. THE FACTORS UNDERLYING ORGANIZED CRIME IN CHINA ARE NOT SIMPLY THE BY-PRODUCTS OF ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION, BUT RATHER RELATED TO THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY FLAWED REFORM POLICIES AND CHINA'S PARTICULAR POLITICAL CONTEXT. THESE PROBLEMS ACCOUNT TO A LARGE EXTENT FOR THE DOUBLE NATURE OF MANY CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AS BOTH ANTI-SOCIAL AND ANTI-STATE FORCES. THE REGIME'S CRACKDOWN ON ORGANIZED CRIME MAY HAMPER EFFORTS FOR GREATER SOCIO-POLITICAL PLURALISM. BUT IN THE LONG RUN, IT MAY STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND LEAD TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELEVANT REFORM POLICIES.
511	BEGINNING WITH THE ROLE OF 'STAKEHOLDERS' - THOSE WHOSE INTERESTS ARE, KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY, AFFECTED - IN THE SITING OF NOXIOUS FACILITIES, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO DEVELOP PRINCIPLES FOR ACCEPTABLE AND DEMOCRATICALLY ARRIVED AT POLICIES RELATED TO PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVANCES IN AND PRODUCTS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH WIDELY REGARDED AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR SUCCESS, THE PRINCIPLES UNDERPINNING STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT, SUCH AS REPRESENTATIVENESS, OFTEN ARE VIOLATED IN PRACTICE. USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE FAILURE TO SITE A HIGH-LEVEL NUCLEAR WASTE (HLW) REPOSITORY IN THE UNITED STATES, COMPLEXITIES RELATED TO THE PROPOSED PRINCIPLES ARE NOTED. BECAUSE SAFE DISPOSAL OF HLW TRANSCENDS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, OTHER PRINCIPLES ALSO ARE RECOMMENDED. THESE INCLUDE: 1. RECOGNITION OF THE INEVITABILITY OF UNCERTAINTY AND AGREED-UPON WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT; 2. DEVELOPMENT OF 'COMMUNITIES OF FATE' AND OF TRUST AMONG ALL STAKEHOLDERS; 3. BUILDING ON COMMON VALUES RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO THE WELL-BEING OF FUTURE GENERATIONS; AND 4. ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW.
512	THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION OF POWER IN THE EU. THE INTERACTION OF THE BODIES INVOLVED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS DESCRIBED. WEAKNESSES IN THIS PROCEDURE ARE ALSO NAMED, AS WELL AS POLICY AREAS THAT ARE WITHHELD FROM THE EU PARLIAMENT. THE SECOND CHAPTER LISTS MEASURES THAT HAVE LED TO POLITICAL REGRESSION IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, WHICH ARE NO LONGER IN LINE WITH THE RULES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE EU AND HAVE LED TO SEVERAL LAWSUITS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE.IN THE THIRD CHAPTER, SEVERAL PROPOSALS ARE PRESENTED WHICH SHOULD FURTHER DEVELOP THE EU INTO A REAL ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. HOWEVER, SOME KEY POINTS OF CRITICISM OF THIS GOAL ARE ALSO MENTIONED. THE FOURTH CHAPTER EXPLAINS THAT THE EU IS NOT ONLY A PURE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, BUT IS ALSO BASED ON COMMON VALUES, FOR EXAMPLE ON THE RULE OF LAW AND A COMMON SOLIDARITY, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR EUROPEAN COHESION.
513	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE VALUE-ADDED TAX GAP IN RELATION TO THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN SELECTED CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE TAX GAP IS CAUSED MAINLY BY TAX EVASION AND TAX AVOIDANCE OF THE VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) AND IS CALCULATED AS A SHARE, IN PERCENT, OF VAT TOTAL TAX LIABILITY. THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE USED TO REPRESENT QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, AND ALL SIX COMPREHENSIVE DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE HAVE BEEN USED: A) VOICE, ACCOUNTABILITY; B) POLITICAL STABILITY, ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE OR TERRORISM; C) EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT; D) QUALITY OF REGULATION; E) THE RULE OF LAW; AND F) CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE RESULTS SECTION SHOWS THE PROVEN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE VAT GAP AND THE WGI INDICATORS IN THE ANALYZED COUNTRIES USING STATISTICAL APPLICATION METHODS (CORRELATIONS) AND DATA FROM 2000 TO 2019. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR RELATED TO THE VAT GAP IS THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, THUS ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENTS TO ENHANCE THE ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES.
514	LAW IS A POWERFUL COMMITMENT DEVICE. BY ENTERING INTO A BINDING CONTRACT, A CONTRACTING PARTY CAN INVOKE THE COERCIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT POWERS OF STATES TO COMPEL ANOTHER PARTY TO PERFORM. MANY, IF NOT MOST, CONTRACTS ARE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT EVER INVOKING THESE COERCIVE POWERS; THEY OPERATE IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW. LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE FLIP SIDE OF LAW'S SHADOW: THE POSSIBILITY OF RELAXING OR SUSPENDING THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW, OR MAKING LAW ELASTIC. WHILE THIS MAY SEEM ANATHEMA TO THE "RULE OF LAW", IT IS NOT AN INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE, ESPECIALLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS. THE ELASTICITY OF LAW SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE INCOMPLETENESS OF LAW, THAT IS, THE INHERENT LIMITATION LAWMAKERS FACE IN TRYING TO ANTICIPATE ALL FUTURE CONTINGENCIES. IN THIS PAPER I WILL OFFER TWO TALES OF THE AMERICAN INSURANCE GROUP (AIG) TO ILLUSTRATE THE ELASTICITY OF CONTRACTS AS WELL AS OF LAW.
515	THIS STUDY ENDEAVOURS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCES OF TOURISM AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THEIR ASSOCIATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY USES PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS TO CONSTRUCT THREE REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INDICES FOR 134 COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2015 (BASED ON DATA AVAILABILITY). FIRST , THE REDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY INDICES ARE MOSTLY IMPROVED IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, WHILE THEY ARE DEGRADED IN SEVERAL HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. SECOND , IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ESPECIALLY REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW, ARE FOUND TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THIRD , BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TOURISM SPENDING ARE FOUND TO DEGRADE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. LASTLY , IT IS SURPRISING TO FIND THAT NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL TOURISM ARE EXACERBATED IN COUNTRIES WITH GOOD INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THESE RESULTS CALL FOR MORE PRUDENT POLICY-SETTING FOR THE TOURISM INDUSTRY, AIMED AT SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT. (C) 2021 INSTITUTION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.

516	THE EU FACES ONE OF THE DEEPEST CRISES SINCE ITS FORMATION. A DANGEROUS RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN SEVERAL MEMBER STATES UNDERMINES THE UNION'S COMMON VALUES AND PUTS EUROPE TO THE TEST. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW TO SUBSTANTIALLY ADDRESS VIOLATIONS OF EU VALUES IN JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE. UNFORTUNATELY, RELYING ON FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, EU SECONDARY LEGISLATION AND EVEN THE CHARTER WILL NOT HELP MUCH TO RESOLVE THIS VALUE CRISIS. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A DIFFERENT PATH AND CALLS FOR ENGAGING WITH ARTICLE 2 TEU ITSELF. YET THIS PROPOSAL RESTS ON A CRUCIAL PREMISE: THE JUDICIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE VALUES ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 2 TEU. BASED ON RECENT JURISPRUDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS, THIS ARTICLE WILL ELABORATE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF ARTICLE 2 TEU VALUES AND DEMONSTRATE HOW THEIR JUDICIAL APPLICABILITY CAN BE CONSTRUED. THE JUDGMENTS OF ASSOCIACAO SINDICAL DOS JUIZES PORTUGUESES, MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY ("L.M.") AND COMMISSION V. POLAND WILL BE AT THE HEART OF THIS PROPOSAL.
517	THIS WORK CONCERNS HEALTH SECTOR REFORM IN NIGERIA BETWEEN 2003 AND 2014. USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS, I INVESTIGATE THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THE REFORM, THE REFORM PROCESS, AND ITS OUTCOME. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ASSESS THE CONFORMITY OF THE POLICY REFORM TO SABATIER AND WEIBLE'S ADVOCACY COALITION FRAMEWORK (ACF) IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE APPLICABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, OF THE ACF IN POLICY ANALYSIS IN STABLE DEMOCRATIC AFRICAN STATES. IN THE ARTICLE, EXTERNAL SHOCK, POLICY SUBSYSTEM, STABLE PARAMETER, TECHNICAL EXPERTS, ADVOCACY COALITIONS, THE "DEVIL SHIFT," AND POLICY CORE BELIEFS-WHICH ARE BASIC COMPONENTS OF ACF-WERE ALL IDENTIFIED IN THE POLICY REFORM PROCESS. I CONCLUDE THAT THE ACF CAN BE APPLIED IN POLICY REFORM IN DEMOCRATIC AFRICAN STATES, SO LONG AS THERE IS THE RULE OF LAW, A SEPARATION OF POWERS, FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION, A FAIRLY STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND THE PRESENCE OF POLICY PARTICIPANTS WITH EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF THE POLICY ISSUES.
518	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION ON AUDITOR BEHAVIOR IN THE UNITED STATES. WE FIND THAT US FIRMS HEADQUARTERED IN MORE CORRUPT REGIONS PAY HIGHER AUDIT FEES, HAVE LONGER AUDIT REPORT LAGS, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A GOING CONCERN AUDIT OPINION. POLITICAL CORRUPTION IS A MANIFESTATION OF A WEAK INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND, AS SUCH, WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW. IN ADDITION, POLITICAL CORRUPTION ERODES THE PUBLIC'S BELIEF IN A POLITICAL SYSTEM AND REDUCES INTERPERSONAL TRUST. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AUDITORS ASSESS THE RISK AND TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THEIR CLIENTS BASED ON WHERE FIRMS ARE HEADQUARTERED. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO USING A 2SLS REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND A PROPENSITY-SCORE-MATCHED SAMPLE. THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE PRIOR RESEARCH ON POLITICAL CORRUPTION AND THE CLIENT RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES USED BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS. MOREOVER, THE CURRENT STUDY WILL BE HELPFUL TO REGULATORS CONSIDERING THE MORE EXPLICIT ROLE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS IN CORRUPTION RISK ASSESSMENT.
519	RIGHT OF ACCESS TO A COURT, ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 6 1 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS FORMS ONE OF THE BASIS FOR REINFORCEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO A COURT MAY BE LIMITED BY PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION REGULATING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND RULES OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURE. THE HIGHER THE HIERARCHY OF THE COURT, THE MORE LIMITS MAY BE PLACED ON THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO IT. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF ORGANISATION OF SUPREME JUDICIARIES IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE) AND MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED IN NATIONAL LEGISLATION FOR FILTERING APPLICATIONS TO THOSE JURISDICTIONS IN CIVIL CASES, IN LIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLES SET FORTH IN THAT REGARD BY THE EVER EVOLVING CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE EFFECTS OF ITS JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS ON NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS.
520	THIS PAPER ASKS IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE MOST COMMON LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED AND USED IN THE CURRENT ANTICORRUPTION TOOLKIT IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CORRUPTION AND IF SPECIFIC CONTEXTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED WHICH ENABLE OR DISABLE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION FOR CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE PAPER DRAWS ON DOCUMENTED PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND ANTICORRUPTION TOOLS FROM THE PAM, THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS DATABASE OF THE WORLD BANK, AND DOCUMENTS ADDITIONAL ONES, INCLUDING AN INDEX OF ANTICORRUPTION REGULATORY DENSITY, COMPRISING ANTICORRUPTION AGENCIES, EXISTENCE OF AN OMBUDSMAN, RESTRICTIONS TO PARTY FINANCE LEGISLATION AND OTHERS. WHILE ONLY FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES ARE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANT, THE INTERACTION OF SOME TOOLS WITH CONTEXT ELEMENTS, SUCH AS FREEDOM OF THE PRESS OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY ENHANCES THEIR IMPACT. THE PAPER ARGUES FINALLY THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME ANTICORRUPTION TOOLS IS STRICTLY DEPENDENT ON CONTEXT, ESPECIALLY THE EXISTENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE OTHERS REMAIN FULLY INSIGNIFICANT.
521	THE GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SHOW THAT MAINSTREAM LIBERAL ACCOUNTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE FAIL TO FULLY CAPTURE THE LATTER'S SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS AS A GENUINELY POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE OF CONTESTATION THAT IS NOT REDUCIBLE TO AN ETHICAL OR LEGAL UNDERSTANDING EITHER IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE OR OF FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN DEVELOPING THIS ACCOUNT IN MORE DETAIL, I FIRST DEFINE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WITH AN AIM OF SPELLING OUT WHY THE STANDARD LIBERAL MODEL, WHILE PROVIDING A USEFUL STARTING POINT, ULTIMATELY LEADS TO AN OVERLY CONSTRAINED, DOMESTICATED AND SANITIZED UNDERSTANDING OF THIS COMPLEX POLITICAL PRACTICE. SECOND, I PLACE THE POLITICAL PRACTICE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BETWEEN TWO OPPOSING POLES: SYMBOLIC POLITICS AND REAL CONFRONTATION. I ARGUE THAT THE IRREDUCIBLE TENSION BETWEEN THESE POLES PRECISELY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS POLITICIZING AND DEMOCRATIZING POTENTIAL. FINALLY, I BRIEFLY EXAMINE THE ROLE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACIES, ADDRESSING A SERIES OF RECENT CHALLENGES MADE IN RESPONSE TO THIS RADICALLY DEMOCRATIC UNDERSTANDING OF DISOBEDIENCE.
522	IT HAS BECOME CONVENTION IN RECENT YEARS TO TREAT THE BUILDING OF INSTITUTIONS AS THE CENTERPIECE OF SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC REFORM. THE CASE OF ESTONIA CHALLENGES THIS VIEW. ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS EVENTUALLY AROSE, ESTONIA BEGAN ITS TRANSITION BEREFT OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPOSEDLY SERVE AS THE REQUISITES OF ROBUST ACHIEVEMENT. THE INSTITUTIONS ONLY EMERGED AFTER AN IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN CORE OF LEADERS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES THAT LAID THE GROUNDWORK. IN PARTICULAR, THE IMPOSITION OF HARD BUDGET CONSTRAINTS SIDELINED POLITICAL CAPITALISTS OPPOSED TO THE RULE OF LAW BY SEVERING THEM FROM THE STATE SUBSIDIES, SOFT LOANS, AND OTHER PRIVILEGES ON WHICH THEY THRIVE. IN THE ABSENCE OF A POWERFUL CLASS OF POLITICAL CAPITALISTS, ESTONIAN GOVERNMENTS WERE FREE TO FORGE AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVE A COLLECTION OF INSTITUTIONS THAT SETS THE COUNTRY APART AMONG ITS POSTCOMMUNIST PEERS. GOOD INSTITUTIONS ARE DESIRABLE BUT NOT NECESSARY FOR POLICY REFORM, AND THEY ARE BETTER SEEN AS AUSPICIOUS KNOCK-ON EFFECTS THAN AS PRIME MOVERS.
523	THIS STUDY CONCEPTUALIZES THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AS A LEGACY-BOUND RESPONSE DRIVEN BY GEOPOLITICAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC DEPENDENCIES. IT EXAMINES THE RUSSIAN CASE, AND CONSIDERS HOW RUSSIAN ACADEMICS DEAL WITH COMPLEX SETS OF DEPENDENCIES AND RIVALRIES, WHILE SORTING EUROPEAN, ASIAN AND SOVIET DRIVERS IN UNIVERSITY POSITIONING AND PARTNERSHIP-BUILDING. THE PAPER RE-EVALUATES THE PATH DEPENDENCE PERSPECTIVE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION LITERATURE BY ARGUING THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONSTRUCTS AND CONVENIENCES THEY ARE PREDISPOSED TO SELECT, ACADEMICS HAVE A CHOICE TO EITHER COMPLY WITH, OR DEFY THE GOVERNMENTAL AND INSTITUTIONAL LEGACIES IMPOSED ON THEM. THE PREVALENCE OF ONE CHOICE OVER THE OTHER, AS WELL AS AN INCONSISTENCY OF CHOICES, SHAPES A COMPLICATED TRAJECTORY THAT CAN BE REFERRED TO AS "HYBRID" DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THE PROGRESSION OF "HYBRID" DEVELOPMENT BY REFLECTING ON THE RUSSIAN LEGACY OF IMPERIAL AMBITIONS AFFECTING THE FRAGILITY OF THE GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE OF KNOWLEDGE, POLICY DEVELOPMENT, COOPERATION AND RULE OF LAW.
524	IN SIERRA LEONE, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MARGINALISATION, AND EXPLOITATION FROM CHIEFS AND ELDERS PROMPTED YOUNG PEOPLE TO 'REVOLT' AGAINST THEM AND THE STATE IN SEARCH FOR ACCEPTANCE, RECOGNITION AND EMPOWERMENT. IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD, YOUTHS HAVE DRAWN ON CERTAIN TENETS OF THE LIBERAL PEACE INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, GOOD GOVERNANCE, DEVELOPMENT AND RULE OF LAW TO CREATE SPACES FOR EXERCISING 'RESISTING POWER' AS WELL AS NEGOTIATING WITH CHIEFDOM AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER, THIS HAS NOT BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE SINCE IN ADDITION TO RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM STATE ELITES, TRADITIONAL AUTHORITIES POSSESS MATERIAL AND COERCIVE POWER WHICH THEY HAVE USED TO CONTROL THE YOUTH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS CRUCIAL FOR CRITICAL PEACE RESEARCH TO MOVE BEYOND EXAMINING POWER RELATIONS BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL ACTORS AND LOCAL ACTORS TO ALSO EXAMINE POWER AND POWER RELATIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS LOCAL GROUPS AS THIS ALSO HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE NATURE OF PEACE BEING ESTABLISHED IN A POST-WAR SITUATION.
525	ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY PERFORMS SOCIAL AND LEARNING FUNCTIONS INDISPENSABLE FOR GREEN GROWTH. STILL FACING THE CHALLENGES OF A LACK OF LOCAL COMMITMENT AND LESS THAN OPTIMAL INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CHINA HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON GRANTING AND ENFORCING PUBLIC RIGHT TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION. THIS WILL HELP BUILD THE SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY FOR GREEN GROWTH THE RULE OF LAW, TRUST, SOCIAL ORGANIZING, CONSENSUS BUILDING, SOCIAL LEARNING, AND COLLECTIVE ACTION. A FOCUSED APPROACH IS DESIRABLE BECAUSE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY ARE LIMITED IN CHINA TARGETING POLLUTANTS AND SECTORS THAT EXERT THE MOST ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH RISKS AS WELL AS THOSE THAT NEED TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADE MOST URGENTLY. THEN, IN THE LONG RUN, ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY SERVES THE FUNDAMENTAL GOALS OF GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTAL DECISION-MAKING ON ENVIRONMENT-RELATED ISSUES IN CHINA, IN LINE WITH BOTH THE GREEN GROWTH FRAMEWORK AND THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT GOAL OF CONSTRUCTING A HARMONIOUS SOCIETY IN CHINA.

526	IN INDIA, THE PHRASE 'FAKE ENCOUNTER' REFERS TO THE EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLING OF A CIVILIAN FOLLOWED BY THE OFFICIAL CLAIM THAT THE VICTIM WAS A PAKISTANI INFILTRATOR KILLED IN A LEGITIMATE MILITARY ENCOUNTER WITH POLICE OR ARMY FORCES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WIDESPREAD PATTERN OF FAKE ENCOUNTERS IN KASHMIR VALLEY IN ORDER TO SHED LIGHT ON THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH VIOLENCE AND TERROR BECOME FICTIONALIZED AND FANTASTIC, WITH KASHMIRI BODIES GAINING A HEIGHTENED VISIBILITY IN A FALSIFIED FORM WITHIN A CULTURAL IMAGINARY OF NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. IDENTIFYING KASHMIR VALLEY AS A STATE OF EXCEPTION, I EXAMINE HOW THE SUSPENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW GIVES RISE TO NEW AGENTS AND HIERARCHIES OF POWER AND AUTHORITY AND NEW PATTERNS OF CRIMINALIZATION AND PARAMILITARIZATION THROUGHOUT KASHMIRI SOCIETY. I ALSO CONSIDER HOW THE INFORMALIZED PRACTICES OF FORCED DISAPPEARANCE, FICTIONALIZED TERROR, AND IMPUNITY FOR VIOLENCE ARE PRODUCED AND REPRODUCED THROUGH THE STRATEGIC MANUFACTURING OF PUBLIC CONSENT FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST KASHMIRIS THROUGHOUT INDIAN SOCIETY AT LARGE.
527	THE PAPER SETS OUT TO DEFINE LIBERALISM THROUGH A BRIEF OUTLINE OF ITS HISTORY, MORE ESPECIALLY ITS ENGLISH DEVELOPMENT, STARTING WITH MAGNA CARTA AND MOVING THROUGH THE UPHEAVALS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE VICTORIAN AGE TO SOME OF THE MODERN DEBATES, PARTICULARLY THAT BETWEEN FREEDOM AND EQUALITY. IT DISCUSSES HOW THE NATURAL LAW CONCEPT TURNED INTO HUMAN RIGHTS AND HOW THEORIES OF CONTRACT CURBED MONARCHICAL HIGH- HANDEDNESS, SO LEADING TO DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. WHILE LAISSEZ FAIRE AND INDIVIDUALISM ARE CONVENTIONALLY THOUGHT TO BE THE ESSENCE OF LIBERALISM, THIS CONCEPT IS CONTRADICTED BY THE COURSE OF REFORM IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND FURTHER STATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTION SINCE. FROM LOCKE TO ADAM SMITH TO L. T. HOBHOUSE IS A HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE. THE STRAND OF LIBERAL THOUGHT FROM MILTON'S AREOPAGITICA TO MILL'S ON LIBERTY IS ALSO BRIEFLY OUTLINED. THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND MARXISM IS TOUCHED ON, AND PATON BRIEFLY RELATED TO THE TRADITION.
528	2003 MARKED THE CENTENARY YEAR OF THE HIGH COURT, AN ANNIVERSARY WHICH PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT DEBATES ABOUT ITS ROLE IN THE AUSTRALIAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THE FIRST SECTION OF THIS ARTICLE CANVASSES DEBATES AROUND THIS QUESTION, CULMINATING IN A CONSIDERATION OF THE HIGH COURT'S 'NEW POLITICS'. THIS SETS THE FRAMEWORK FOR AN EXAMINATION OF EVENTS IN 2003 FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL AND OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, IN PARTICULAR THE EXECUTIVE. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXECUTIVE INTERVENTIONS IN RELATION TO THE JUDICIARY, AS WELL AS IMPORTANT CASES BROUGHT BEFORE THE HIGH COURT. IT ARGUES THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES IS ONLY LIKELY TO INCREASE WHERE CONTRADICTIONS OF PURPOSE ARISE BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS AND OBLIGATIONS, THE RULE OF LAW AND DOMESTIC POLICY OBJECTIVES. THIS ARTICLE IS THE THIRD IN A SERIES OF REVIEWS OF THE HIGH COURT FROM A POLITICAL-SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE PUBLISHED IN THE AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE.
529	EUROPE AND THE US, TWO OF THE GREAT UNIONS THAT SHAPE AND DEFINE THE MODERN WORLD, ARE MORE CLOSELY ALLIED THAN EVER. WE LIVE WITHIN A SHARED COMMUNITY OF VALUES - RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE BOUND TOGETHER NOT IN A FEDERAL UNITED STATES OF EUROPE, BUT A UNION OF NATION-STATES THAT EMBODY THOSE VALUES. SINCE ITS EARLY INCEPTION THE EU HAS SOUGHT TO CREATE PEACE AND STABILITY, AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE US TO THAT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. YET THERE ARE SOME ARTICULATE VOICES ALL TOO READY TO ARGUE THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE AND I GREW UP WITH ARE OUT OF DATE. PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OCEAN WHO CLAIM THE TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS REDUNDANT, AND THAT NATO IS SIMPLY A RELIC OF THE COLD WAR, EITHER BECAUSE, FOR THE US, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA MUST NOW TAKE PRECEDENCE OR, FOR EUROPE, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SO MUCH USE FOR OUR AMERICAN PARTNERS ANYMORE.
530	THE FIFTEENTH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY WAS THE LAST CONGRESS HELD IN THIS CENTURY AND THE FIRST WITHOUT STRONGMEN. WITH THE PASSING OF THE OLD REVOLUTIONARIES, THE JIANG ZEMIN-CENTERED THIRD-GENERATION LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY CHINA'S DRAMATIC SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGES. IT NOT ONLY MUST PROMOTE FURTHER ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ALSO COPE WITH NUMEROUS UNDESIRABLE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONSEQUENCES. THUS, JIANG TOOK INITIATIVES IN THE FOLLOWING THREE ASPECTS: FIRST, HE INITIATED AN IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN BY CALLING FOR A THIRD LIBERATION OF THOUGHT AND USING AIL POSSIBLE MEANS TO PROMOTE THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SECOND, HE CONSOLIDATED HIS "FORTRESS" BY RESHUFFLING PARTY PERSONNEL. THIRD, HE ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE DEMANDS FOR POLITICAL REFORM AND POLITICAL STABILITY BY PROPOSING TO DEVELOP DEMOCRACY WITHIN THE PARTY, INSTITUTE THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONSOLIDATE GRASS-ROOTS DEMOCRACY HOWEVER, WHETHER JIANG WILL BE CAPABLE OF REALIZING HIS NEW AGENDA WILL DEPEND ON THE TEST OF TIME.
531	GOVERNMENTS SEEK TO REDUCE PERVASIVE FIRM INFORMALITY FOR MULTIPLE REASONS: TAXES, FIRM GROWTH, RULE OF LAW, AND INFORMATION. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT IN MALAWI TO TEST THREE ALTERNATIVES TO ACHIEVING THESE GOALS: A) HELPING FIRMS OBTAIN A BUSINESS REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE THAT OFFERS FORMAL MARKET ACCESS BUT IMPOSES NO TAX OBLIGATIONS; B) HELPING FIRMS OBTAIN BOTH BUSINESS AND TAX REGISTRATION; AND C) SUPPLEMENTING BUSINESS REGISTRATION WITH A BANK INFORMATION SESSION. WE FIND INCREDIBLY HIGH DEMAND FOR OBTAINING A FORMAL STATUS THAT IS SEPARATE FROM TAX OBLIGATIONS, AND VERY LOW TAKE-UP OF TAX REGISTRATION. BUSINESS REGISTRATION ALONE HAS NO IMPACT ON FORMAL MARKET ACCESS OR FIRM PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, COMBINING REGISTRATION ASSISTANCE WITH THE BANK IN-FORMATION SESSION INCREASES FIRM SALES BY 20 PERCENT AND PROFITS BY 15 PERCENT. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE AD-VANTAGES OF SEPARATING BUSINESS AND TAX REGISTRATION, BUT ALSO THE NEED TO HELP FIRMS BENEFIT FROM THEIR NEW FORMAL STATUS.
532	THIS PAPER EXPLORES TWO MODELS OF PREFERENCE-FORMATION OF TRUST IN THE POLICE IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN: AN INSTITUTIONAL MODEL THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF BROAD ASSESSMENTS OF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE AND LEGITIMACY AND AN EXPERIENTIAL APPROACH FOCUSSED ON MORE NARROW EXPERIENCES OF VICTIMIZATION AND POLICE CONTACT. WE EXAMINE THESE FRAMEWORKS BASED ON THEORY AND ANALYSIS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND SURVEYS FROM THE AMERICAS BAROMETER 2014 (N = 34,798 RESPONDENTS T = 22 COUNTRIES). FINDINGS SHOW THAT RESPONDENTS WITH HIGHER CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT ALSO INDICATE HIGHER RATINGS OF TRUST IN THE POLICE. SIMILARLY, TRUST IS HIGHER AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NOT EXPERIENCED VICTIMIZATION OR BRIBERY OR WHO ANTICIPATED FASTER POLICE RESPONSE TIMES. AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TRUST IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT POSITIVELY RELATED TO RULE OF LAW. WE DRAW ON THESE FINDINGS TO OUTLINE AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL THAT COMBINES BOTH INSTITUTIONAL AND EXPERIENTIAL PERSPECTIVES.
533	FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT IS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROCESS THAT PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRY. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON MULTIDIMENSIONAL FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, AND ITS DIMENSIONS, SUCH AS, DEPTH, ACCESS, AND EFFICIENCY. WE USED A PANEL DATASET OF 85 EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES FROM 1996 TO 2018 FOR ANALYSIS. OUR FINDINGS BASED ON 2SLS ESTIMATION DEMONSTRATE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, ESPECIALLY ITS DEPTH, ACCESS, AND EFFICIENCY. THE BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT MOST OF THE KEY COMPONENTS (CONTROL OF CORRUP-TION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ENHANCE THE FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, SPLIT-SAMPLE ANALYSIS, ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENT, AND ESTIMATOR. THIS PAPER ALSO OFFERS USEFUL POLICY IMPLICATIONS TO THE STAKEHOLDERS IN EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES.(C) 2022 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.
534	WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM INFLUENCE DEMAND-SIDE CREDIT CONSTRAINTS. WE EXPLORE THE NOTION OF DISCOURAGED BORROWERS - FIRMS THAT CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR BANK CREDIT BECAUSE THEY ANTICIPATE REJECTION. EMPLOYING SURVEY DATA FROM 46 ECONOMIES, WE FIND THAT RAPID AND LESS COSTLY COURT PROCEEDINGS, LOWER PROCEDURAL COMPLEXITY IN COURT PROCESSES, AND HIGHER RECOVERY RATES UNDER BANKRUPTCY LEAD TO THE LOWER LIKELIHOOD OF BORROWER DISCOURAGEMENT. THESE RESULTS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG CREDITOR PROTECTIONS IN RELATION TO COMPANY REORGANIZATION AND LIQUIDATION. THE RESULTS CORROBORATE THE SUPPLY-SIDE VIEW THAT STRONG CREDITOR RIGHTS AND THEIR EFFICIENT ENFORCEABILITY ALLEVIATE BANKS' PARTICIPATION CONSTRAINTS IN THE LOAN MARKET, THEREBY ENCOURAGING SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES TO APPLY FOR CREDIT IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE ALSO FIND THAT DIFFERENCES IN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS, SUCH AS HIGHER REGULATORY QUALITY, BETTER CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND THE RULE OF LAW, LEAD TO LOWER RATES OF CREDIT SELF-RATIONING IN THE LOAN MARKET.
535	THIS PAPER FULFILLS A GAP IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND CORRUPTION ON THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF 31 OECD COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2002 TO 2015 INCLUSIVELY. TO ENSURE ROBUSTNESS IN OUR ESTIMATIONS, WE EMPLOYED SEVERAL ECONOMETRICS TECHNIQUES, INCLUDED CONTROL VARIABLES IN OUR MODELS, USED SEVERAL PROXIES FOR THE VARIABLES UNDER INVESTIGATION, SPLIT THE DATA INTO SUBGROUPS BASED ON THE DEGREE OF DEMOCRACY, AND REPEATED THE ANALYSIS FOR THESE GROUPS. OBTAINED FINDINGS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THE SIGN OF ALL THE CONTROL VARIABLES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE A-PRIORY THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY PROPOSE SEVERAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS ENHANCING SOCIAL COHESION THROUGH EDUCATION ON THE USE OF TAX CONTRIBUTIONS, REVISING BUDGET PROCEDURES TO ENSURE EFFICIENT SPENDING OF RESOURCES AND TO IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND REDUCING CORRUPTIVE PURSUITS BY TARGETING THE INFORMAL ECONOMY ACTIVITIES AND MODIFYING THE RULE OF LAW.
536	CHINA'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM SUPPORTS STATE-LED DEVELOPMENTALISM, WHEREBY RECENTLY REINSTATED LAWYERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONCENTRATE THEIR PRACTICE ON SERVICING MARKETIZED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FOR THE SAKE OF NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, CONTEMPORARY CHINESE LAWYERS, AS PART OF THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE INCREASINGLY MARKETIZED ECONOMY, ARE PRACTICALLY REQUIRED TO BEDEVELOPMENTAL LAWYERS, SO THEY BROADLY SHARE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CITIZENSHIP OF MOST CHINESE CITIZENS. SUCH STATUS OF CHINESE LAWYERS CORRESPONDS TO THE OVERALL SYSTEMIC ORDER OF CHINA AS A POST-SOCIALIST STATE IN WHICH SOCIO-ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION HAS BEEN ADVANCED FOR DEVELOPMENTAL PURPOSES WITHOUT ATTENDANT POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION (THAT IS, REFORMING THE PARTY-STATE DICTATORSHIP). WHILE MOST LAWYERS HAVE MANAGED TO SURVIVE OR SUCCEED IN THE CONTEXT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTAL INSTRUMENTALITY, THEIR PROFESSIONAL AUTHORITY AND INTEGRITY IN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN CHRONICALLY COMPROMISED BY BOTH THE ECONOMIC ORDER THAT REMAINS STATE-SEGMENTED AND THE POLITICAL DISCOURAGEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCACY.
537	JUDICIAL REVIEW IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD TO BE A REMEDY OF LAST RESORT, BUT THERE REMAINS LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROCESS CAN ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL REDRESS. THIS ARTICLE APPLIES THE RESULTS OF A STUDY INTO OMBUDSMAN JUDICIAL REVIEW TO CHART THE OUTPUTS OF THE VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROCESS AT WHICH AN OUTCOME CAN BE SECURED. THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT OMBUDSMAN JUDICIAL REVIEW DOES SECURE A SMALL LEVEL OF SUCCESS FOR CLAIMANTS BOTH IN AND OUT OF COURT BUT THAT THE RATE OF SUCH SUCCESS IS LOWER FOR CITIZEN CLAIMANTS THAN THE NORM IN ALL JUDICIAL REVIEW CASES. THE EXPLANATION PROVIDED FOR THIS PATTERN IS THAT ORGANISATIONALLY OMBUDSMAN SCHEMES HAVE LEARNT LESSONS FROM BEING REPEAT PLAYERS IN JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO INTEGRATE RULE OF LAW VALUES THAN MANY OTHER PUBLIC BODIES. CITIZEN CLAIMANTS, BY CONTRAST, INCLUDE A HIGH PROPORTION OF INEXPERIENCED LITIGANTS-IN-PERSON FOR WHICH THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCESS IS ILL-DESIGNED TO FACILITATE.
538	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO THEORIZE AND EXAMINE HOW TARGET COUNTRY GOVERNANCE QUALITY, TARGET COUNTRY MARKET POTENTIAL AND ACQUIRER'S PRIOR EXPERIENCE IMPACTS EQUITY PARTICIPATION IN CROSS-BORDER ACQUISITIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE HYPOTHESIZED EFFECTS ARE TESTED USING A SAMPLE OF 1,447 ACQUISITIONS UNDERTAKEN OVER AN 11-YEAR TIME BY US-BASED MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES (MNES) IN FOUR EMERGING MARKETS: BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA (BRIC). FINDINGS - ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT TARGET COUNTRY GOVERNANCE QUALITY (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) STRONGLY INFLUENCES EQUITY PARTICIPATION, AND MARKET POTENTIAL MODERATES THE INFLUENCE OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON EQUITY PARTICIPATION. FURTHER, FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT ACQUIRER'S TARGET COUNTRY ACQUISITION EXPERIENCE AMPLIFIES THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF MARKET POTENTIAL ON GOVERNANCE QUALITY-EQUITY PARTICIPATION RELATIONSHIP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY ADDS TO THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE OF EQUITY PARTICIPATION IN CROSS-BORDER ACQUISITIONS (CBAS) UNDERTAKEN BY FOREIGN MNES IN BRICS. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS IMPORTANT SINCE MNES ACROSS THE GLOBE INVEST IN BRIC UTILIZING CBA, AND RELATED RESEARCH REMAINS LIMITED.
539	ANY LIBERAL THEORY THAT WOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY THE QUESTION OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW IS BOUND TO ENGAGE WITH DISCRIMINATION-RELATED MATTERS, AND SO LONG AS ONE IS A LIBERAL ONE SHOULD OPPOSE ALL DISCRIMINATION COMING FROM THE STATE. THIS, HOWEVER, MAY BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD SINCE MANY CLASSICAL LIBERALS HAVE QUITE READILY OPPOSED PROGRESSIVE TAXATION BY INVOKING ITS DISCRIMINATORY NATURE. SOME LIBERALS WILL THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT ONE CANNOT ESTABLISH DIFFERENT TAX BRACKETS, LEST TAXATION BE ILLIBERAL. THIS PAPER ENDEAVOURS TO REFUTE THIS ASSUMPTION. PROGRESSION MAY BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL CONCERN FOR THE RULE OF LAW, PROVIDED LEGISLATIVE DISCRETION ON TAX-RELATED MATTERS IS DULY LIMITED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF GENERALITY, AS WELL AS BY A CERTAIN STANDARD OF REASONABLE LAWMAKING. THROUGH A CAREFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOUR CONCEPTS OF DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT, THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT PROGRESSIVE TAX ARRANGEMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE WELL-OFF, AND THAT IT CAN EFFICIENTLY FULFILL SOME LEGITIMATE CLASSICAL LIBERALS OBJECTIVES.
540	LEGALLY PROTECTED INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A CONSTRAINED STATE ARE DOCTRINES OF NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS-DERIVED DEVELOPMENT THEORY. BUT WHAT ABOUT CHINA? IT LACKS STRONG RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS CAN BE COLLECTIVE, CONTESTED AND AMBIGUOUS, AND THE STATE IS RELATIVELY UNCONSTRAINED AND MAINTAINS A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE ECONOMY; YET IT HAS SEEN IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO TAKE IT TO THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY. I ARGUE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF LEGAL/RATIONAL PROTECTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NETWORKS CAN PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PROPERTY PROTECTION, ALLOWING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - WITH POLITICAL PROTECTION SUBSTITUTING FOR LEGAL. THE NOVEL CLAIM I MAKE IS THAT AMBIGUITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AND SPACES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION, WITH THE BUILDING OF MEANING AND INSTITUTIONS FOUND IN A TRANSITIONAL STATE, WHERE RULES ARE UNCLEAR AND CONTESTED, AND WHERE FORMAL RULES CAN CATCH UP IF APPARENT SUCCESS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED.
541	THIS STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF INFORMAL CONSTRAINTS, PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS, ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. USING ARCHIVAL DATA FROM A PANEL SAMPLE OF 32 COUNTRIES-BETWEEN 2006 AND 2010-WE FIND THAT A HIGHER PROPORTION OF PROTESTANTISM IS ASSOCIATED WITH STRONGER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AFTER CONTROLLING FOR CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THE SOCIO-CULTURAL THEORY, WHICH POSITS THAT SOCIO-CULTURAL VARIABLES SUCH AS RELIGION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF AGENCY COSTS (CHARREAUX, 2004, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE THEORIES: FROM MICRO THEORIES TO NATIONAL SYSTEMS THEORIES, WORKING PAPER). THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTE TO THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTING, FINANCE, AND MANAGEMENT LITERATURE BY SHOWING THAT SOCIAL NORMS, ESPECIALLY RELIGION, HAVE A STRONG EFFECT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS FOR POLICY MAKERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ENHANCING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, ALLOWING THEM TO STRENGTHEN FORMAL CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS RULE OF LAW FOR COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS A LOW PROPORTION OF PROTESTANTS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
542	THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE DEFENSE AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS - AND OF THE OSCE'S BROADER HUMAN DIMENSION OF SECURITY - IN A CONTEXT OF WHAT COULD BE CALLED "MULTIPLE CRISES", I.E., THE CRISIS IN AND AROUND UKRAINE, THE REFUGEE CRISIS IN EUROPE, AND THE THREAT OF TERRORISM. WHILE THE INCLINATION MIGHT BE TO ADDRESS THESE CRISES WITH A CLASSICAL "POLITICO-MILITARY" APPROACH, THE ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT AN APPROACH BASED ON ENSURING THE HUMAN DIMENSION OF SECURITY - HUMAN RIGHTS, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTING TOLERANCE WHILE COMBATING DISCRIMINATION - IS JUST AS VITAL IF REAL AND LASTING RESOLUTIONS TO THESE CRISES ARE TO BE FOUND. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, WHILE THE CURRENT CRISES REPRESENT DANGERS IN RELATION TO SECURITY IN THE OSCE AREA, THEY ALSO REPRESENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REAFFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HUMAN DIMENSION AS PART OF THE OSCE'S COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THAT VERY SAME SECURITY.
543	DEVELOPMENT OPTIMISTS IN SOUTH ASIA HAVE ARGUED THAT ELECTORAL POLITICS AND THE REDUCED ROLE OF VILLAGES AS CENTRES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAVE LARGELY PUT AN END TO EXPLOITATION BY DOMINANT CASTES. ALTHOUGH THE POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE EMERGED OUT OF THESE CHANGES FALL SHORT OF THE IDEALIZED STANDARDS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, VARIOUS COMMENTATORS HAVE ARGUED THAT THEY NEVERTHELESS BENEFIT SUBORDINATE CLASSES. PARTHA CHATTERJEE EVEN ARGUES THAT THE AD HOC AND EXTRA-LEGAL NATURE OF THESE POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS - WHICH HE TERMS POLITICAL SOCIETY' - ACTUALLY SERVE POPULAR ENFRANCHISEMENT BETTER THAN THE LAW-BOUND ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SOCIETY, WHICH HE SEES AS CAPTIVE TO CAPITAL. ON THE BASIS OF VILLAGE ETHNOGRAPHY FROM THE PAKISTANI PUNJAB, I ARGUE THAT POLITICAL SOCIETY IS IN FACT INTEGRAL TO PROCESSES THAT DISPOSSESS PEOPLE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND TO THE REPRODUCTION OF ELITE POWER. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES HOW IT IS NOT THE COLD RATIONALITY OF THE STATE AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT DISENFRANCHISE SUBORDINATE CLASSES, BUT THEIR ABSENCE.
544	CONSERVATION-DEVELOPMENT CONFLICTS ARE PROBLEMS THAT CHALLENGE GLOBAL SOCIETY AND ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR CONSERVATION ECOLOGY RESEARCH. A REDLINE PARADIGM HAS EVOLVED AT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL IN CHINA AS A NEW ATTEMPT FOR BETTER RESOLUTION OF CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFLICTS, INCLUDING REDLINES FOR CROPLAND CONSERVATION, FORESTLAND CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT, PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT ZONES, RESTRICTED DEVELOPMENT ZONES, AND KEY ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION ZONES. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT OVERLAPS AMONG THESE REDLINES AND OTHER LAND RESOURCE DEMANDS ARE KEY SOURCES OF HOT DEBATES ABOUT PRACTICALITY. TO ADVANCE THE REDLINE PARADIGM AS A PRACTICAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TOOL, WE PROPOSE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING (1) STRENGTHENING THE EXECUTIVE CAPACITY OF REDLINE MANAGEMENT BY RULE OF LAW, (2) DEVELOPING CLOSER COLLABORATIONS AMONG DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL SECTORS, (3) CREATING MULTI-SOURCE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES THROUGH PAYMENT SCHEMES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, AND (4) PROMOTING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE REDLINE PARADIGM IN CHINA MAY SERVE AS AN EXAMPLE OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION FOR OTHER NATIONS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
545	SINCE 1978, CHINA HAS OPENED ITSELF TO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND HAS UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT LEGAL REFORM, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION. I ANALYZE THE ROLES THAT FOREIGN ACTORS AND STATE OFFICIALS HAVE PLAYED IN CHANGING CHINESE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE CHINESE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE ARBITRATION COMMISSION (CIETAC) AND PERSONAL RELATIONS, OR GUANXI.(1) FOREIGN INVESTORS, ATTORNEYS, AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE HELPING CHINA TO ADOPT FORMAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRAL INSTITUTIONS THAT FOLLOW INTERNATIONAL NORMS. IN THAT SENSE, FOREIGN ACTORS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. YET, FOREIGN INVESTORS ALSO ATTEMPT TO USE GUANXI TO GET AROUND CENTRAL REGULATIONS, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO INFORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE COMBINATION OF GUANXI AND FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS FOLLOWS A MODEL OF PATH DEPENDENT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. I USE THE TERMS, 'LAYERING' AND 'BRICOLAGE' TO ELUCIDATE THE WAYS THAT ACTORS COMBINE EXISTING INSTITUTIONS WITH NEW LEGAL FORMS INTRODUCED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS, ATTORNEYS, AND NGOS.
546	AS THE FIRST SURVEY OF THE TOPIC, THIS REVIEW COVERS ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM SINCE ITS EMERGENCE A CENTURY AGO, SHOWING A SIGNIFICANT RANGE OF HISTORICAL VARIATION. THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE SEPARATED BY A WATERSHED, THE LATE COMING OF THE AGE OF IDEOLOGY, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE CREATION OF PAKISTAN IN 1947, THUS PREDATING THE CONTEMPORARY RESURGENCE OF ISLAM BY SOME TWO DECADES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, ISLAM APPEARED AS A LIMITATION TO GOVERNMENT AND LEGISLATION, WITHOUT ANY PRESUMPTION THAT IT SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. IN THE SECOND PHASE, ISLAM CAME TO BE CONSIDERED THE BASIS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE STATE. IN THE INCIPIENT THIRD PHASE OF POSTIDEOLOGICAL ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM, WE WITNESS A RETURN TO THE IDEA OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT-THIS TIME AS THE RULE OF LAW ACCORDING TO A CONSTITUTION THAT IS NOT BASED ON BUT IS INCLUSIVE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM AS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION.
547	IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT (NPM) IS TYPICALLY USED TO IMPROVE EXISTING INSTITUTIONS DEMOCRATICALLY WHERE THE BUREAUCRACY IS ALREADY CONTROLLED THROUGH AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER IN MEXICO, IT IS BEING USED AS A TOP-DOWN REFORM STRATEGY WHERE SOLID INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS, RULE OF LAW, CHECKS AND BALANCES, CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM, AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS ARE ALL ABSENT OR INEFFECTIVE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ROBUST INSTITUTIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT, THIS USE OF NPM REFORM STRATEGIES FACES TWO BASIC DANGERS: (A) OVERRELYING: ON TECHNIQUES OVER SUBSTANTIVE REFORM AND (B) UNDERESTIMATING THE DIFFICULTY OF CHANGING THE EXISTING BUREAUCRATIC CULTURE. GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SITUATION IN MEXICO, THE MOST PROBABLE OUTCOME OF IMPLEMENTING NPM IDEAS IS SYMBOLIC RATHER THAN ACTUAL CHANGE. THAT IS, GOVERNMENT IS MOST LIKELY TO IMPLEMENT REENGINEERING TEAMS BUT TO RENDER THEM INEFFECTIVE BY RETAINING THE EXISTING VERTICAL AND AUTHORITARIAN STRUCTURE AND CULTURE. A CASE STUDY EVALUATING MEXICO CITY'S NPM-BASED ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM PROGRAM IS USED TO SUPPORT THESE CONCLUSIONS.
548	SINCE INDEPENDENCE, THE POLITICISATION OF ISLAM IN PAKISTAN HAS FOSTERED A CULTURE OF ATROCITIES AGAINST RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. THIS EXPLAINS WHY PAKISTAN TOPS THE LIST OF COUNTRIES AT THE RISK OF MASS KILLINGS. THE ISLAMIC REVIVALIST MOVEMENT THAT EMERGED UNDER THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP OF GENERAL ZIA-UL-HAQ DURING THE 1970S-80S IS OFTEN EQUATED WITH PAKISTAN'S DESCENT INTO RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE. THE CONTROVERSIAL BLASPHEMY LAWS MODIFIED UNDER HIS REGIME CONTINUE TO ABET ATROCITY CRIMES ACROSS PAKISTAN. THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS TO UNDERSTAND THE PREVALENCE OF HATE SPEECH AND INCITEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF RECENT EPISODES OF VIOLENCE, IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE STATE'S COMPLEX GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, ITS STRUGGLE TO COUNTER EPISODES THAT INCITE VIOLENCE, AND THE BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR KEY REFORMS ON BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL TO PUSH FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ATROCITY PREVENTION FRAMEWORKS.
549	THE LAST DECADE OR SO HAS WITNESSED INTENSIFYING EFFORTS BY CHINA TO RESHAPE ITS LE-GAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION. THESE EFFORTS ECHO ITS ADVANCEMENT OF THE "ONE BELT AND ONE ROAD INITIATIVE" AND A POLICY OF STRENGTHENING THE FOREIGN-RELATED RULE OF LAW. BUT THE MEASURES SO FAR HAVE BEEN PIECEMEAL AND WERE ADOPTED MAINLY BY THE SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT (SPC). LEADING LOWER CHINESE COURTS, THE SPC HAS ZEALOUSLY ADVANCED THE REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION BY DEVICES SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL COURTS (ICCS), ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTIONS, FORUM NON CONVENIENS AND DE JURE RECIPROCITY FAVOURING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS. SUCH EFFORTS MAY HELP MODERNIZE CHINA'S MECHANISM FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION, AND MORE ARE EXPECTED. ALTHOUGH WHAT THE SPC HAS BEEN DOING MOVES CLOSER TO THE GLOBAL MAINSTREAM AND IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK, DEEP REFORMS ARE STILL NEEDED BEFORE THE CHINESE INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LITIGATION REGIME CAN "GO GLOBAL".
550	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL, JUDICIAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS IN THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN FROM 2016 TO 2021. METHODOLOGY. THE SPECIFICITY OF THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE REQUIRES THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: THE SYSTEMS APPROACH, THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND THE INSTITUTIONAL METHOD. RESULTS. THE STUDY PROVIDES AN OBJECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REFORMS WHICH PRIMARILY AIM TO IMPROVE BENIN'S PERFORMANCE IN THE INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL, JUDICIAL AND ECONOMIC SECTORS. FROM OUR ANALYSIS IT RESULTS THAT IN THEIR GREAT MAJORITY, THE REFORMS IN BENIN ARE LIKELY TO IMPROVE IN THE LONG TERM THE LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE POPULATIONS, PLACING THE COMMON INTERESTS ABOVE THE PERSONAL INTERESTS. INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL REFORMS CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR CONSOLIDATING AND MODERNIZING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN BENIN. THE AUTHORS DRAW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF BENIN IN RECENT YEARS IS MAINLY THE RESULT OF ALL THE REFORMS UNDERTAKEN SINCE 2016.
551	RICK ABEL'S CLASSICPOLITICS BY OTHER MEANS (1995)USED SOUTH AFRICA TO ARGUE FOR LAW'S 'POTENTIAL NOBILITY', BUT IT DID SO AVOIDING A HEROIC MODE CHARACTERISTIC OF MUCH ANTI-APARTHEID WRITING. ABEL SHOWED HOW LAW COULD, WITH STRENUOUS EXERTION, BE TURNED INTO A DEFENSIVE SHIELD FOR THE OPPRESSED. AS A SWORD, HOWEVER, IT WAS 'TWO-EDGED'. IT ALLOWED THE POWERFUL TO FRUSTRATE OR OVERTURN HARD-WON SYMBOLIC VICTORIES. RECENTLY, THE HEROIC MODE HAS RETURNED TO SOUTH AFRICA. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, IN PARTICULAR, IS LAUDED FOR HAVING COMBATED 'STATE CAPTURE' UNDER DEPOSED PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA. A CLOSER EXAMINATION OF THIS PERIOD, HOWEVER, DOES MUCH TO VINDICATE ABEL'S EARLIER SCEPTICISM ABOUT LAW'S OFFENSIVE VALUE. THE SPECTACULAR DEPLOYMENT OF LAW TO FIGHT POLITICIANS' CRIMES HAS EXPOSED THE JUDICIARY TO UNEXPECTED POLITICAL THREATS. MEANWHILE, CIVIL SOCIETY'S EFFORTS TO ENTRUST JUDGES WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES SHIRKED BY THE GOVERNMENT HAS INEVITABLY ENTAILED THE SACRIFICE OF SOME RULE OF LAW VALUES.
552	THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN PRAISED FOR SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTING DEMOCRACY THROUGH ITS POLITICAL ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY BY INCENTIVIZING CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH STABLE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND IMPROVE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES. HOWEVER, RECENT DEMOCRATIC DOWNTURNS IN THE REGION HAVE BROUGHT INTO QUESTION THE QUALITY AND LONGEVITY OF DEMOCRACY THAT THE UNION PROMOTES. BY TRACING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRESS TOWARDS SATISFYING EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP REQUIREMENTS IN TWO COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS, MONTENEGRO AND SERBIA, I FIND THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S STANDARDS OF DEMOCRACY FALL SHORT OF REQUIRING STABLE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND LONG-TERM SUCCESSES IN PRODUCING POLITICAL SYSTEMS THAT RESPECT AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES, THE RULE OF LAW, AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. INSTEAD OF REQUIRING PROSPECTIVE MEMBER STATES TO COMPLY WITH ACCESSION CRITERIA, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ALLOWING THEM TO PROGRESS ALONG THE INTEGRATION PATH WITH ONLY PARTIAL COMPLIANCE, WEAKENING ITS OWN ABILITY TO INDUCE MEANINGFUL REFORMS.
553	WITH THE POPULARIZATION OF MOBILE TERMINALS, INFORMATION IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNIMPEDED, ALONG WITH THE ADVENT OF THE ERA OF BIG DATA. IT BRINGS BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES TO THE GOVERNANCE OF GOVERNMENT NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION. USING THE LITERATURE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND THE CASE ANALYSIS, COMBING THE RESEARCH RESULTS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN SCHOLARS, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION GOVERNANCE, CONCLUDES THAT HAVING INITIALLY BUILT A BIG DATA PLATFORM FOR NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION AND REALIZED THE TRANSFORMATION FROM MANAGING TO GOVERNING NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION, THE GOVERNMENT STRENGTHENS THE AWARENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW OF NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION GRADUALLY. ALSO, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT FULLY GRASPED THE OPPORTUNITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE BIG DATA, WITH IDEA, TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ETHICAL DILEMMA REMAINING. FINALLY, FROM THE THREE ASPECTS IT PROVIDES DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE A HEALTHY AND GREEN NETWORK PUBLIC OPINION ECOLOGY.
554	THE COURAGE PROJECT HAS CREATED AN OPEN-ACCESS E-DATABASE THAT COLLECTED NEW SOURCES, SUMMARIZED NEW KNOWLEDGE AND CREATED NEW NARRATIVES ABOUT A HITHERTO DIVIDED EUROPEAN CULTURAL HERITAGE: THE LEGACY OF DISSENT UNDER THE COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE. THE ROMANIAN COURAGE TEAM HAS HIGHLIGHTED A NEW SENSE OF BEING EUROPEAN, WHICH WAS EXPERIENCED BY MANY ORDINARY INDIVIDUALS WHO CREATED EVERYDAY MEANINGS AND CULTURAL PRACTICES AS IF THEY LIVED IN A FREE COUNTRY. THIS IDENTIFICATION WITH EUROPE IS REFLECTED IN PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PRIVATE COLLECTIONS CREATED BY THOSE WHO ENVISAGED STRATEGIES OF OPPOSING THE COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS THAT HAD REJECTED THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES UNDERPINNING THE EUROPEAN UNION: RULE-OF-LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, CIVIL LIBERTIES, ETC. THE OPPOSITE VALUES ARE REFLECTED IN THE COLLECTIONS CREATED BY THE ROMANIAN COMMUNIST SECRET POLICE, THE SECURITATE, WHICH REMIND OF A NON-DEMOCRATIC EUROPEAN PAST AND WARN AGAINST THE DANGER OF FORGETTING IT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THE EUROPEAN PROJECT IS FACING.
555	PERCEPTION RESEARCH CAN MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF THE LOCAL DIMENSION IN EU PEACEBUILDING. THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED IN THIS ARTICLE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS OF THE "LEGITIMACY," "EFFECTIVENESS," AND "CREDIBILITY" OF EU PEACEBUILDING PRACTICES, WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS FOR SUCCESSFUL PEACEBUILDING. RELYING ON THE CASE OF THE EU'S SUPPORT FOR SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) IN PALESTINE, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS-WHICH PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS EU-SPONSORED TRAINING AND CAPACITY-BUILDING PROGRAMS-DISPLAY CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT FOR LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING NORMS. YET, PERCEIVED DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE EU'S PEACEBUILDING RHETORIC AND ITS SSR ACTIVITIES HAVE SEVERELY UNDERMINED THE POTENTIAL OF THE EU'S LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING MODEL IN THE EYES OF PALESTINIAN STAKEHOLDERS. CRITICAL LOCAL PERCEPTIONS ARE FREQUENTLY ARTICULATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE EU'S OWN LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING DISCOURSE, POINTING TO A LACK OF INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SSR PROCESS AND DEFICITS IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
556	BASED ON AN ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE ENCLAVES IN INDIA AND BANGLADESH, THIS PAPER EXPLORES ENCLAVE DWELLERS LIVED EXPERIENCES OF VULNERABILITY WHERE LIFE IS TRAPPED IN-BETWEEN TWO STATES. THESE ENCLAVES ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED IN ONE COUNTRY BUT POLITICALLY AND LEGALLY BELONG TO ANOTHER. THE ABSENCE OF A HOME COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW AND THE IRREGULAR PRESENCE OF THE HOST COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGN POWER AND CONTROL CONSTRUCT, IN GIORGIO AGAMBEN'S TERMS, A 'SPACE OF EXCEPTION' WHERE EVERYDAY LIFE IS CHARACTERISED BY EXCLUSION FROM LEGAL RIGHTS, BUT NONETHELESS SUBJECT TO LAW, SOCIO-POLITICAL EXPLOITATION AND GENDERED VIOLENCE. BY SITUATING AGAMBEN'S 'BARE LIFE' IN THESE ENCLAVES, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTUALISATION OF BARE LIFE AS SOLELY A SOVEREIGN PRODUCTION PAINTS AN INADEQUATE PICTURE OF THE ZONE OF ABANDONMENT. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT IN ADDITION TO THE SOVEREIGN CREATION OF BARE LIFE, SOCIAL AND GENDERED DIMENSIONS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A NUANCED APPROACH TO THIS CONCEPT. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER LTD.

557	THE IDEA OF CREATING AN INTERNATIONAL POLICE FORCE (IPF) WAS FIRST MOOTED BY LORD DAVID DAVIES IN THE 1930S. IN 1963 U THANT, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THEN CLAIMED THAT HE HAD 'NO DOUBT THAT THE WORLD SHOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL POLICE FORCE'. YET OUR INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON STATES, THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND A CORRELATIVE 'INSIDE/OUTSIDE' DISTINCTION: A DISTINCTION WHICH IS RESISTANT TO THIS IDEA OF SOME FORM OF SYSTEMATIC INTERNATIONAL POLICING WRIT LARGE. INSTEAD OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IPF, A NEW FORM OF INTERNATIONAL POLICING HAS EMERGED THROUGH THE UNPRECEDENTED USE OF POLICE ABROAD AND THE POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION OF MORE SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL POLICING NORMS. THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT MAY NOT BE AS PERMANENT NOR AS WIDE RANGING AS EARLIER CONCEPTUALISATIONS THAT CONCERNED THEMSELVES WITH A MORE STRUCTURED MANAGEMENT OF INTERSTATE BEHAVIOUR, BUT, NONETHELESS, IT INCREASES THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING AN INTERNATIONAL ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
558	ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO MORE ICONIC, STALWART, AND ELOQUENT DEFENDER OF LIBERTY AND REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY THAN J. S. MILL, HE SOMETIMES ENDORSES NONDEMOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE REASONS BEHIND THIS SEEMING ABERRATION AND SHOWS THAT MILL ACTUALLY HAS COMPLEX AND NUANCED VIEWS OF THE TRANSITION FROM NONDEMOCRATIC TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPREHENSIVE AND PARALLEL MATERIAL, CULTURAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND CHARACTER REFORMS THAT MUST OCCUR, AND THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THEY WILL BE ENACTED. NAMELY, AN ENLIGHTENED DESPOT MUST CULTIVATE DEMOCRATIC VIRTUES SUCH AS OBEDIENCE, INDUSTRIOUSNESS, SPIRIT OF NATIONALITY, AND RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY IN THE POPULATION AND SIMULTANEOUSLY PREPARE THE WAY FOR HIS OWN DEMISE AND SECURE HIS OWN LEGITIMACY BY TRANSITIONING TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CHALLENGES RECENT SCHOLARSHIP THAT PAINTS MILL'S NONDEMOCRATIC VIEWS AS CRUDELY AND UNCRITICALLY IMPERIALIST, BECAUSE IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE AND ENGAGE SERIOUSLY WITH HIS SOPHISTICATED (IF ULTIMATELY PROBLEMATIC) THEORY OF INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT UNDER ENLIGHTENED COLONIALISM.
559	DESPITE HIGHLY PUBLICIZED EFFORTS BY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO CURB MUSIC PIRACY, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS CONTINUED TO ILLEGALLY DOWNLOAD AND SHARE MUSIC. THIS STUDY OBTAINED COLLEGE STUDENT RESPONSES TO SCENARIOS THAT MEASURED PERCEPTIONS OF THREE TYPES OF MUSIC THEFT: SHOPLIFTING A CD, ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADING, AND ILLEGALLY DOWNLOADING PLUS FILE SHARING. THE STUDENTS ALSO REPORTED THEIR OWN RECENT DOWNLOADING BEHAVIOR, COMPLETED A DEMOGRAPHICS QUESTIONNAIRE, AND RESPONDED TO A SERIES OF STATEMENTS THAT ASSESSED THEIR ATTITUDES REGARDING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LEGAL COMPLIANCE IN OTHER DOMAINS. THE DATA INDICATED THAT STUDENTS VIEWED DOWNLOADING AND FILE SHARING VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY VIEWED SHOPLIFTING IN TERMS OF ENDORSEMENT OF REASONS TO COMPLY WITH LAWS PROHIBITING THOSE BEHAVIORS. FURTHER, CONCERNS REGARDING PUNISHMENT (I.E. DETERRENCE), MORALITY BELIEFS, AND GENERALIZED OBLIGATION TO OBEY THE RULE OF LAW HAD THE STRONGEST RELATIONSHIPS TO SELF-REPORTED DOWNLOADING BEHAVIOR. RESPECT FOR THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAD THE WEAKEST RELATIONSHIP TO LEGAL COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH RESPONSES TO THE SCENARIOS AND STUDENTS' SELF-REPORT OF THEIR OWN DOWNLOADING BEHAVIOR.
560	THIS PAPER EXPLAINS WHAT IS MEANT BY THE STOCK OF LEGISLATION, THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS MANAGEMENT, WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO MANAGE IT AND THE DIFFERENT POLICIES, INSTITUTIONS AND TOOLS USED TO ENSURE ITS ACCESSIBILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLICITY. IT SHOWS HOW DIFFERENT APPROACHES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AT DIFFERENT TIMES FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES. A NUMBER OF TASKS NEED TO BE UNDERTAKEN TO MANAGE THE STOCK OF LEGISLATION IN ANY ENTITY OR COUNTRY. THESE ARE TO IDENTIFY THE STOCK OF LEGISLATION, TO STORE IT ELECTRONICALLY, TO REVIEW THE WHOLE OF THE STOCK TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIONS AND CONFUSION CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE AMENDMENTS AND FINALLY TO PUT IN PLACE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS TO MAINTAIN THE STOCK IN A WELL-MANAGED FORMAT. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THE STOCK OF LEGISLATION IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FLOW OF NEW LEGISLATION AS A MEANS OF MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION AND IN TURN THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW.
561	ARGENTINA INCORPORATED SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES INTO ITS CONSTITUTION IN 1994, UNIQUELY IMPORTING INTERNATIONAL LAW INTO ITS DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM. WHILE RECENT SCHOLARSHIP LINKS INTERNALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW TO OBEDIENCE, THE ARGENTINE EXPERIMENT HIGHLIGHTS THAT NAKED CONSTITUTIONALIZATION WILL NOT NECESSARILY ENHANCE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. AFTER ANALYZING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY'S DEBATES AND THE ENSUING FATE OF THE FRESHLY CONSTITUTIONALIZED HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES IN DOMESTIC COURTS, THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE PROBLEMS AND THE INCIPIENT PROMISES OF ARGENTINA'S CONSTITUTIONALIZATION EXPERIMENT MAY BE TRACED TO THE IDENTITY, ENTHUSIASM, AND COHESIVENESS OF THE TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS THAT COALESCED TO DRIVE THE INTERNALIZATION STRATEGY. FURTHERMORE, IN COUNTRIES LIKE ARGENTINA, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT FIRMLY ANCHORED, AN INTERNALIZATION STRATEGY THAT CENTERS ON LAW, AND LAW ALONE, IS UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED. A SUCCESSFUL INTERNALIZATION STRATEGY MUST BE A DYNAMIC, MULTIFACETED PROCESS THAT ENGAGES A MYRIAD OF TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS FROM SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AS WELL AS LEGAL, SPHERES.
562	LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ALMOST UBIQUITOUS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE LAST DECADES. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN RESTRUCTURED, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN RESHAPED, AND NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. BASICALLY, THIS IS A RESPONSE TO THE EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION IN THE SOCIETY. THE IDEOLOGICAL PREMISES UNDERLYING THESE PROCESSES ARE COMPLEX AND MANIFOLD. PARTLY, THEY REFER TO THE TRADITIONAL VALUES OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, WITH AN ACCENT ON AUTONOMY, PARTICIPATION, AND EFFICIENCY. PARTLY, THEY REFER TO FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF CENTRAL STEERING IN THE CONTEMPORARY STATE: RULE OF LAW, GEOGRAPHICAL REDISTRIBUTION, AND MACROECONOMIC STEERING. THIS VARIEGATED SET OF VALUES AND REQUIREMENTS HAS TO BE GIVEN SPACE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION. THIS IS WHY THE PROCESS OF REORGANIZATION CANNOT BE SUBSUMED UNDER A DICHOTOMY OF CENTRALIZATION AND DECENTRALIATION. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES IS TOO COMPLEX TO BE ACCOMMODATED BY SUCH A SIMPLE FORMULA, REQUIRING A REDEFINITION OF ITS ROLE IN SOCIETY.
563	LUIS ROBERTO BARROSO IS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LEGAL SCHOLARS IN LATIN AMERICA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CHALLENGE HIS THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY. BARROSO BELIEVES THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION STEMS FROM THREE DIFFERENT ROLES PERFORMED BY CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. FIRST, COURTS PLAY A COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN ROLE; SECOND, THEY HAVE ALSO A "REPRESENTATIVE ROLE." ALTHOUGH JUDGES LACK VOTES, THEY ARE BETTER POSITIONED THAN LEGISLATURES TO INTERPRET THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS VULNERABLE TO PARTISAN INTERESTS. FINALLY, COURTS CAN PERFORM AN "ENLIGHTENED ROLE"; THEY CAN BREAK THE POLITICAL INERTIA AND LEAD SOCIETY TO A BETTER FUTURE. ALTHOUGH THESE POWERS SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY, COURTS CAN ACT AS AN ENLIGHTENED VANGUARD AND PUSH HISTORY FORWARD IN THE INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS. WE ARGUE THAT THESE ROLES ARE CONCEPTUALLY INCONSISTENT AND THAT THE LAST TWO ROLES ARE NOT JUSTIFIED. WE CONCLUDE, IN ADDITION, THAT BARROSO'S THEORY OF JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY ENCOURAGES A POLITICIZATION OF ADJUDICATION AND CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
564	ONE OF THE MOST CITED AND INFLUENTIAL SOCIO-LEGAL ARTICLES IS BILL FELSTINER, RICK ABEL, AND AUSTIN SARAT'S 'THE EMERGENCE AND TRANSFORMATION OF DISPUTES: NAMING, BLAMING, CLAIMING HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS ', PUBLISHED IN 1981. FORTY YEARS LATER, THE NOTIONS AND FRAMEWORK OF THE ARTICLE ARE STILL HIGHLY RELEVANT. WE CONVENED FELSTINER, ABEL, AND SARAT FOR AN INTERVIEW ABOUT THE BACKGROUND TO THEIR ARTICLE, ITS RECEPTION, AND HOW THEY VIEW THE RECENT REFOCUS ON INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE INTERVIEW FOLLOWS THREE NARRATIVES. FIRST, IT EXPLORES THE SOCIAL RELATION BETWEEN THE AUTHORS AND THE ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT FROM WHICH THE ARTICLE EMERGED. SECOND, IT ADDRESSES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF RESEARCH. THIRD, IT POINTS TO WAYS IN WHICH WE, TODAY, ATTEMPT TO CREATE ACCESS TO OFFICIAL CHANNELS FOR PROBLEM SOLVING AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION AS WELL AS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECTING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF NAMING, BLAMING, AND CLAIMING WITH RESPECT TO JUSTICIABLE PROBLEMS.
565	USING A SAMPLE CONSISTING OF 1212 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS MADE UP OF FORTUNE 500 FIRMS AND THEIR MATCHING FIRMS FROM 1997 TO 2013, WE INVESTIGATE BOTH THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES OF FIRMS WITH AT LEAST ONE FOUNDER WHO MIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES AND MOTIVATION FOR SUCH MIGRANTS TO SET UP BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES INSTEAD OF THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES. WE FIND THE BOARDS OF FIRMS WITH AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT FOUNDER TO HAVE STATISTICALLY MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCES FROM BOARDS OF FIRMS WITHOUT ANY IMMIGRANT FOUNDER. SUCH BOARDS TEND TO BE BOTH SMALLER AND MORE INDEPENDENT AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HEADED BY CHAIRMEN WHO ARE NOT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (CEOS). WE ALSO FIND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT MIGRANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ESTABLISH BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES THE LOWER THEIR HOME COUNTRIES SCORE ON POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AS MEASURED BY THE WORLD BANK'S WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI).

566	FEMALE POLITICIANS IN LATIN AMERICA EXPERIENCE MYRIAD FORMS OF GENDER-BASED ABUSE, FROM PHYSICAL ATTACKS TO DEGRADING SEXUAL COMMENTARIES. ACTIVISTS HAVE FRAMED THIS PROBLEM AS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN POLITICS (VAWIP), AN EMPHASIS ON WOMEN'S POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL RIGHTS THAT REFLECTS THE POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE. IN LATIN AMERICA, BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS FOMENT IMPUNITY, NORMALIZING ACTORS' USE OF VIOLENCE TO MAINTAIN POLITICAL AND PATRIARCHAL POWER. CITIZENS' RIGHTS TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SECURITY ARE NOT PROTECTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO ELECT AND BE ELECTED HAVE RECEIVED SUBSTANTIVE PROTECTIONS FROM ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS AND ELECTORAL COURTS. CONSEQUENTLY, FRAMING VAWIP AS AN ELECTORAL CRIME REPRESENTS A CLEVER ACTIVIST STRATEGY-BUT ONE THAT RESEARCHERS CANNOT ADOPT WITHOUT LOSING EXPLANATORY POWER. FROM AN ACADEMIC STANDPOINT, VAWIP OVERLOOKS HOW WIDESPREAD IMPUNITY RESULTS IN THE ROUTINIZATION OF VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT STATE AND SOCIETY, LEADING TO POLICY SOLUTIONS NARROWLY TAILORED TO PUNISHING POLITICAL PARTIES AND PROTECTING ELITE WOMEN. SUCH REFORMS DO LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
567	AS CHINA'S 12-YEAR EXPERIENCE IN THE WTO HAS INDUCED AN AMBITIOUS GLOBAL VISION SO-CALLED "NEW SILK ROAD STRATEGY," ITS GLOBAL STATUS HAS LEVELED UP TO 'G2' OF THE WORLD. IN TERMS OF GLOBAL TRADE, CONSUMERS ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE GAINED MUCH FROM CHEAP CHINESE GOODS, AND CHINESE GROWTH HAS PROVIDED A HUGE MARKET FOR OTHER COUNTRIES' EXPORTS. THIS PAPER BRIEFLY ANALYZES TRADITIONAL ISSUES CONCERNING CHINA'S CASES IN THE WTO IN SUCH AREAS AS GOODS AND SERVICES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DISPUTE SETTLEMENT, MULTILATERAL AND REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS. IT ALSO TACKLES CHINA-RELATED ISSUES IN THE WTO INCLUDING INVESTMENT, COMPETITION, GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT, TRADE FINANCE, AND LABOR AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT CHINA NEEDS TO BE EQUIPPED WITH BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW AND GREATER ROOM FOR TRADE LIBERALIZATION. MOREOVER, THE WTO IS EXPECTED TO ENCOURAGE AND BOOST CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WHILE CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO POSE BOTH NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS TO THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM.
568	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT THAT EMERGES WHEN PRIVATE CORPORATIONS ENGAGE IN PUBLIC POLICY, EITHER BY PROVIDING CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS AND GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS (CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP) OR BY INFLUENCING THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND LOBBYING FOR THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS (STRATEGIC CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES). THIS DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT IS SIGNIFICANT, ESPECIALLY WHEN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS OPERATE IN LOCATIONS WHERE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS ARE WEAK OR EVEN FAIL, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS ABSENT AND THERE IS A LACK OF DEMOCRATIC CONTROL. THIS DEFICIT MAY LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE BUSINESS FIRM AND ITS CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES AND, THUS, TO A LOSS OF CORPORATE LEGITIMACY. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS CORPORATIONS MAY COMPENSATE FOR THE EMERGING DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT AND REESTABLISH THEIR LEGITIMACY BY INTERNALIZING DEMOCRATIC MECHANISMS WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS, IN PARTICULAR IN THEIR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND PROCEDURES. THE AUTHORS ANALYZE THE AVAILABLE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODELS WITH THE HELP OF A TYPOLOGY AND DISCUSS THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF A NEW FORM OF DEMOCRATIC CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.
569	TRUST IN THE JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION CONDITIONS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE VERY RULE OF LAW, AND CAN EVEN PROMOTE INTERPERSONAL TRUST AND, HENCE, SOCIAL CAPITAL. INFERRING ITS DETERMINANTS, WHICH IS WHAT I SEEK TO DO FOR THE SPANISH CASE, IS THEREFORE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. I FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF TRUST IS DEPENDENT ON THE ECONOMIC CYCLE (WITH EVIDENCE OF ANTICYCLICALITY) AND INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER THE SERVICE PROVISION IS DECENTRALIZED. THESE OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT CITIZENS EXPECT THE JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION TO PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN INSURING THEM AGAINST A NEGATIVE ECONOMIC SHOCK, UNLESS THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IS PARTICULARLY MARKED, WHILE THEY DO NOT EXPECT-INDEPENDENTLY OF THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY-DECENTRALIZATION TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE (OR ARE UNAWARE OF WHICH TIER OF GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS PROVISION). FINALLY, WE OBTAIN INDIRECT EVIDENCE THAT TRUST WOULD BE STRENGTHENED IF THE RESOLUTION RATE IN THE CIVIL JURISDICTION WERE TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY (BY AROUND 25%), WHILE IN THE CRIMINAL JURISDICTION THIS MARGIN OF IMPROVEMENT IS MODERATE.
570	THE FAMOUS DECISION BY DISTRICT JUDGE JOHN WOOLSEY LIFTING THE BAN ON THE PUBLICATION OF JAMES JOYCE'S NOVEL ULYSSES IN THE UNITED STATES CHANGES THE NATURE OF OBSCENITY LAW WHEN IT APPEARS IN 1933, BUT THE OPINION ITSELF IS DEFECTIVE IN WAYS THAT LEAD TOWARD AN UNWORKABLE LEGAL STANDARD IN FUTURE CASES. WHEN A DECISION IS ACCEPTED, BUT THE LOGIC FOR REACHING IT IS FAULTY, THE LAW SUFFERS IN A PARTICULAR WAY, AND THIS KIND OF DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MEANS AND ENDS IS OFTEN FOUND IN THE DECISIONS OF HIGH-PROFILE CASES. JUDGE WOOLSEY'S USE OF STANDARD RHETORICAL DEVICES TO HOLD HIS SEVERAL AUDIENCES IN PLACE IS, THEREFORE, WORTH EXAMINING BEYOND ITSELF. UNITED STATES V. ONE BOOK CALLED "ULYSSES" PROVIDES A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF HOW JUDICIAL RHETORIC PERSUADES THE AUDITORS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR A RULE OF LAW. PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD, THE OPINION CAN HELP AN ENGAGED CITIZENRY TO RECOGNIZE AND EVALUATE THE METHODS THAT CONTROL UNDERSTANDING IN A CONTROVERSIAL OPINION.
571	DO HIERARCHICAL POLITICS IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY SHAPE COLLEGIAL POLITICS ON THE U.S. COURTS OF APPEALS AND THUS INFLUENCE JUDICIAL VOTING AND CASE OUTCOMES? I DEVELOP A MODEL IN WHICH THE POLITICAL CONTROL OF THE DUAL LAYER OF HIERARCHY ABOVE THREE-JUDGE PANELS-FULL CIRCUITS AND THE SUPREME COURT-AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN JUDGE ON A THREE-JUDGE PANEL TO INFLUENCE TWO COLLEAGUES FROM THE OPPOSING PARTY. THE THEORY PREDICTS THAT PANEL MAJORITIES SHOULD BE MORE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY A SINGLE JUDGE OF THE OPPOSING PARTY-A "COUNTER-JUDGE"-WHEN THAT JUDGE IS ALIGNED WITH THE SUPREME COURT. EXAMINING THOUSANDS OF JUDICIAL VOTES IN MULTIPLE ISSUE AREAS, I SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF ADDING A COUNTER-JUDGE TO A PANEL IS INDEED ASYMMETRIC, AND VARIES BASED ON HIERARCHICAL ALIGNMENT. THE INTERACTION OF HIERARCHICAL AND COLLEGIAL POLITICS INCREASES THE SUPREME COURT'S CONTROL OF THE JUDICIAL HIERARCHY AND HELPS PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW.
572	THE PROCESSES OF ECONOMIC INTEGRATION INDUCED BY GLOBALIZATION HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CERTAIN TYPE OF LEGAL PRACTICE THAT CHALLENGES THE CORE VALUES OF LEGAL ETHICS. LAW FIRMS SEEKING TO REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE CORPORATE CLIENTS MUST EMBRACE AND SYSTEMATICALLY APPLY CONCEPTS OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING AND INSTALL CORPORATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES TO SUSTAIN COMPETITION FOR LUCRATIVE CLIENTS. THESE MEASURES BEAR A HIGH CONFLICT POTENTIAL WITH THE CORE VALUES OF LEGAL ETHICS. HOWEVER, WE OBSERVE IN PARALLEL A GLOBAL CONSOLIDATION OF THESE CORE VALUES THROUGH AN ENHANCED COOPERATION OF NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL BODIES, THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL CODES, AND COMPARATIVE LEGAL ETHICS TEACHING AND RESEARCH. FURTHERMORE, STATE REGULATION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS CONCERNED WITH PRESERVING THE CORE VALUES OF LEGAL ETHICS TO CONSERVE THE LAWYER'S ROLE IN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE DEFENDS THAT LEGAL ETHICS IS ADAPTING TO THE PRESSURES EXERTED BY "MANAGERIAL" APPROACHES TO LEGAL PRACTICE WITHOUT THIS ALTERING CORE VALUES THAT UNDERLIE LEGAL ETHICS.
573	IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, A GROWING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHOSE BASIC RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED HAVE FILED TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CLAIMS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. BY PLACING THE INDIVIDUAL AS A HOLDER OF BASIC RIGHTS AT THE CORE OF THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT, THE CAPABILITY APPROACH, AS PUT FORWARD BY AMARTYA SEN AND MARTHA NUSSBAUM, PROVIDES A FERTILE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS TRANSLATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LITIGATION. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT TRANSNATIONAL CLAIMS ARE PROBLEMATIC IN TWO REGARDS: 1) THEY UNDERMINE DEVELOPMENT BY DISCOURAGING FOREIGN COMPANIES FROM INVESTING IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE SOURCES OF TRANSNATIONAL CLAIMS AND BY WEAKENING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND JUDICIARIES; 2) THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS IS INADEQUATE BECAUSE FINANCIAL AND PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS PREVENT STAKEHOLDERS FROM DIRECTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS, AND BECAUSE ASSESSING DAMAGES AND ENFORCING AWARD JUDGMENTS WILL MOST LIKELY BE UNFAIR. THE PATH TO BE TAKEN INVOLVES DEVELOPING A STRONGER RULE OF LAW, STRONGER LOCAL INSTITUTIONS AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIARIES IN THOSE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHERE THE VIOLATIONS OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS TAKE PLACE.
574	THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE OF CHINESE CORPORATIONS IS PROMOTED IN TWO MAIN DIMENSIONS. ON THE ONE HAND, BASED ON EXTERNAL PRESSURE FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM SURROUNDING NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, CORPORATIONS NEED TO ADJUST THEIR PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REQUIREMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE IS BASED ON THE CONSENSUS OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY IN REGARDS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. THE MEMBERS OF CORPORATIONS, DUE TO THEIR AWAKENING TO THE IDEA OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INDEPENDENTLY ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THROUGH ECOLOGICAL OPERATION. THE LATTER IS MAINLY DEVELOPED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION COMPLIANCE BASED ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FACES PROBLEMS, SUCH AS CONFLICTS BETWEEN MULTIPLE VALUES, THE MISALIGNMENT OF COMPLIANCE SUBJECTS, AND THE LACK OF BINDING FORCE. IN FACT, THE PERCEPTION, PARTICIPATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITIES, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. SOFT LAW CAN BRING TOGETHER CORPORATE EMPLOYEES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE ETHICAL CONSENSUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE.
575	WE USE A COMBINATION OF EXTREME GRADIENT BOOSTING AND SHAP ADDITIVE EXPLANATIONS TO UNCOVER THE DETERMINANTS OF SOVEREIGN RISK ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2021. BY CONSIDERING NUMEROUS VARIABLES ESTABLISHED IN EXISTING LITERATURE WITHIN A SINGLE FRAMEWORK, WE IDENTIFY YEAR-BY-YEAR DETERMINANTS OF SOVEREIGN CREDIT RISK. TO GAGE THE LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY ASPECTS OF SOVEREIGN RISK, WE UTILIZE 5- AND 10-YEAR YIELD SPREADS AS PROXIES. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE KEY VARIABLES DRIVING SOVEREIGN RISK HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER TIME AND EXHIBIT SIMILARITIES IN BOTH LIQUIDITY AND SOLVENCY COMPONENTS. AMONG THE PROMINENT VARIABLES, VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE, INCLUDING THE CURRENT ACCOUNT, GDP GROWTH, PER CAPITA GDP GROWTH, AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE. PRIOR TO THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS, MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES, PARTICULARLY THE CURRENT ACCOUNT, HELD THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE IN EXPLAINING SOVEREIGN RISK. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE GFC, THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE VARIABLES DIMINISHED, GIVING WAY TO INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES, ESPECIALLY THE RULE OF LAW.
576	THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC, INSTITUTIONAL, AND CULTURAL FACTORS ON GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION. THE PRESENT RESEARCH CONSIDERS ONLY SOURCES FOR WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION CO -FINANCES INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTION CAPACITY; THUS, WE EXCLUDE HYDROELECTRIC POWER. THE ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS ARE INTERNAL CONSUMPTION AND NATIONAL INCOME, THE INSTITUTIONAL ONES ARE THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, AND THE CULTURAL ONES ARE THE NATIONAL CULTURAL INDICATORS OF HOFSTEDE.DATA COMPRISE THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOR THE 2007-2015 PERIOD, THE LONGEST TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNION HAS REMAINED MOSTLY UNCHANGED. WE EMPLOY RANDOM EFFECTS PANEL DATA MODELS AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING. OUR MAIN RESULTS EMPHASISE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF INTERNAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POWER DISTANCE, AND UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE. THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING POINTS OUT THREE BEHAVIOURAL GROUPS BASED ON THESE VARIABLES. TWO OF THEM ARE QUITE HOMOGENEOUS WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE COUNTRIES ON THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT.
577	WHILST REGIONAL PARTICIPATION ACROSS ASEAN INDUCES THE LIBERALIZATION OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE AS IT IS A KEY COMPONENT OF SUSTAINABILITY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE HOW GOVERNANCE QUALITY FACTORS INFLUENCED STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. THIS STUDY APPLIED THE PANEL LEAST SQUARE (PLS) AND PANEL COINTEGRATION FULL-MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (FMOLS) ESTIMATIONS TO GAUGE HOW QUALITY GOVERNANCE FACTORS IMPACT AN INTEGRATED ASEAN STOCK MARKET IN THE LONG RUN. THIS STUDY UTILIZED DATA FROM THE ASEAN EXCHANGES COVERING THE PERIOD 2002 TO 2020. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AS WELL AS POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE LACK OF VIOLENCE; MEANWHILE, RULE OF LAW NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. THIS IMPLIES THAT HIGHER-QUALITY GOVERNANCE IMPROVES THE STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE IN AN INTEGRATED MARKET.
578	THE G5 SAHEL (MAURITANIA, NIGER, BURKINA FASO, MALI AND CHAD) WAS FORMED TO COUNTER TERRORIST GROUP INSURGENCIES WITHIN ITS MEMBER STATES. EUROPEAN UNION INVOLVEMENT IN THIS EFFORT HAS REVOLVED AROUND ENHANCING POLITICAL DIALOGUE AND PEACEBUILDING STRATEGIES, BUT CHALLENGES PERSIST, ESPECIALLY THE THREAT OF SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS COMBINING FORCES WITH ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS. THE STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU STRATEGIES IN COMBATTING INSTABILITY IN THE SAHEL REGION. THIS MIXED-METHODS STUDY USES THE SECURITY-DEVELOPMENT NEXUS PERSPECTIVE CONCEPTUALLY, DRAWING QUALITATIVE DATA FROM SECONDARY SOURCES AND QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM THE FRAGILE STATES INDEX, CONSIDERING INDICATORS FOR GROUP GRIEVANCES; STATE LEGITIMACY; HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW; AND SECURITY APPARATUS. THE STUDY HYPOTHESISES THAT THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE G5 SAHEL REGION IS PRIMARILY A CONSEQUENCE OF BAD GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL DISCREPANCIES WITHIN THESE STATES. IT CONCLUDES THAT EU EFFORTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS ENHANCING LONG TERM STATE RESILIENCE INTERNALLY, TO BETTER WITHSTAND TERRORISM.
579	THIS PAPER DEPICTS THE DYNAMICS OF THE EU-TURKEY RELATIONS BEGINNING FROM THE SIGNING OF THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, I.E. THE ANKARA CONTRACT, TO DATE. IN ADDITION, IT AIMS TO SPECIFY THE FACTORS PREVENTING THE BILATERAL COLLABORATION AND ACHIEVEMENT OF EU MEMBERSHIP AS ASPIRED TO BY ANKARA. THE PAPER FOCUSES ON BOTH THE INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS ARISING ON TURKEY'S PATH TO EU MEMBERSHIP, NAMELY, THE WESTERNISATION TREND ORIGINATING FROM KEMAL ATATURK TIMES, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TURKEY, THE DEMOCRATISATION OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, REGIONAL SECURITY, TURKEY'S PART IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS, VISAFREE TRAVEL, GREEK-TURKEY RELATIONSHIPS, ANKARA'S STANCE TOWARDS CYPRUS, THE KURDISH PROBLEM, AND THE TURKEY-US AND TURKEY-RUSSIA RELATIONSHIPS. THE AUTHORS DISCUSS THE EU MEMBER STATES' ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE POLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN TURKEY AND THE WAY ANKARA LOOKS AT THE REQUIREMENTS PUT FORWARD BY THOSE MEMBER STATES. WE SUGGEST SEVERAL METHODS OF RAPPROCHEMENT AND BRIGHTER BILATERAL PROSPECTS.
580	ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES OF MATURE LEGAL SYSTEMS IS THE NEED TO BALANCE THE CONFLICTING DEMANDS OF STABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY. THE DEMAND FOR FLEXIBILITY IS AT ODDS WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF IMPARTIALITY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A CORNERSTONE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE, I EXPLORE THE WAY IN WHICH THE LAW COPES WITH THIS DILEMMA BY DEVELOPING THE IDEA OF TOLERANCE OF INCOHERENCE. I ARGUE THAT TOLERANCE OF INCOHERENCE EMERGES FROM THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE INFERENTIAL AND LEXICAL-SEMANTIC RULES THAT DETERMINE THE MEANING OF LEGAL SPEECH ACTS. I BASE THIS ARGUMENT ON AN INFERENTIAL MODEL OF SPEECH ACTS, WHICH I DEVELOP THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF GRADED SPEECH ACTS, AND ON THE IDEA THAT THE USE OF SPEECH ACTS IS GOVERNED BY MULTIPLE AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING CONVENTIONS. I SHOW HOW THIS TOLERANCE ALLOWS THE LAW TO RESOLVE THE TENSION BETWEEN DYNAMISM AND TRADITIONALITY, AND DISCUSS ITS SOCIOLOGICAL AND MORAL IMPLICATIONS.
581	WHILE THE AUSTRALIA-ISRAELI RELATIONSHIP ENCOMPASSES A CORDIAL BILATERAL COMRADESHIP, IT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT DIPLOMATIC SKIRMISHES THAT HAVE TESTED ITS REPUTATION AND STRENGTH. IN PARTICULAR, CONTROVERSIAL INTELLIGENCE LIAISONS COUPLED WITH RECURRING SECURITY-RELATED SCANDALS POSE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND CHALLENGES TO AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS. THIS ARTICLE WILL EXPLORE THE RATIONALE, EXECUTION AND HAZARDS OF THE AUSTRALIA-ISRAEL INTELLIGENCE RELATIONSHIP FROM AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE. WHEN DEALING WITH INTELLIGENCE EXCHANGE ACROSS NATIONS AND INFORMATION SHARING WITH ALLIES THAT MIGHT ENTAIL BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL ARRANGEMENTS, IT IS ARGUED THAT TRANSPARENCY AND SECRECY CAN CO-EXIST WHEN RECONCILED THROUGH ROBUST, INDEPENDENT AND WELL-RESOURCED NATIONAL OVERSIGHT INSTITUTIONS. IN AN ERA OF EXPANDING GLOBALISATION OF INTELLIGENCE, TARGETED ACCOUNTABILITY ADVANCES THAT ARE ADAPTIVE TO GLOBAL TRENDS MAY SERVE TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL COSTS AND DOWNSIDES OF TRANSNATIONAL INTELLIGENCE EXCHANGE WHILE RESPECTING THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF CITIZENS AND ENSURING THAT SOVEREIGNTY, HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS AND RULE OF LAW REMAIN PROTECTED.
582	BASED UPON INTERVIEWS, FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND CONTENT ANALYSES, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONTINUING FROM INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND PREPARATIONS DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISIONS TO ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL SUPERVISION COMMITTEE SYSTEM (THE SC SYSTEM) HAS TRANSFORMED CHINA'S PREVIOUS DUAL-TRACK ANTI-CORRUPTION SYSTEM INTO A SINGLE ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY MODEL IN THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL LOCATIONS. MERGING WITH THE PARTY'S DISCIPLINE INSPECTION COMMITTEES (DICS), THE SCS HAVE ABSORBED THE ANTI-CORRUPTION FORCE OF THE PROCURATORATES AND HAVE BECOME THE ONLY ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCY. THE LOCAL PARTY LEADERS' INFLUENCE IN ANTI-CORRUPTION SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASES. THE PARTY CENTER HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO MAINTAIN ITS CONTROL IN THE NEW MODEL, RATHER THAN RELINQUISHING CONTROL OR NECESSARILY PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. LACKING EMPOWERED OUTSIDERS AND MOTIVATED AGENCIES FOR PROVIDING SUPERVISION, THE SCS STILL RELY UPON STRONG POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AND THE SUPERVISION AGAINST MANIPULATION OF THEIR ANTI-CORRUPTION POWER IS URGENT.

583	A NUMBER OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) PROMOTES FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THIS FINDING CHIMES WITH PRONOUNCEMENTS AND POLICIES OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK (WB) AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IME). CONTRASTINGLY, AND ON THE BASIS OF A STUDY OF 34 COUNTRIES OVER A 20YEAR PERIOD, OUR STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE COMPARABILITY EFFECT OF FULL IFRS ADOPTION PORTEND A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE NET FDI OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS HAVE TWO KEY IMPLICATIONS. FIRST, IN THE CASE OF AFRICA, FOREIGN INVESTORS APPEAR TO BE CONCERNED WITH THE COSTS OF OPERATING IN AN IFRS-REGULATED ENVIRONMENT. SECONDLY, FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION, RATHER THAN IFRS ADOPTION, APPEAR MORE IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING OR ENHANCING THE LEVEL OF FDI IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

584	IN THIS ARTICLE WE ARGUE THAT EFFORTS IN INDONESIA TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE DISADVANTAGED WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM A PRAGMATIC APPROACH THAT TAKES LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF CUSTOM, VALUES AND SOCIAL RELATIONS INTO ACCOUNT AT LEAST AS MUCH AS LEGAL REFORM AND BUREAUCRATIC TRANSPARENCY. WE MAINTAIN THAT IN POST-SUHARTO INDONESIA 'JUSTICE' CAN BE CONCEPTUALISED AS THE INVERSE OF INJUSTICE AND IS MANIFESTED IN TERMS OF SOVEREIGN INTERESTS. IDEAL JUSTICE, SUCH AS ASSOCIATED WITH RULE OF LAW IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS, ASSUMES A FUNCTIONING OF GOVERNMENT AND JUDICIARY THAT MIGHT BRING ABOUT SUCH RESULTS. BUILDING ON OUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL AS ON THE ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE WE ARGUE THAT ENGAGING WITH THE ROLE AND MEANING OF JUSTICE SHOULD INVOLVE SOLID ETHNOGRAPHY OF JUSTICE-SEEKERS' LIFE-WORLDS, UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRATEGIES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDE JUSTICE, AND PAYING ATTENTION TO THE NETWORKS AND INTERACTIONS THAT CONNECT ACTORS IN AN EVER MOVING FIELD.
585	THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN LATIN AMERICA IS A PENDING ISSUE IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AND THE SUPPOSEDLY DEMOCRATICALLY CONSOLIDATED COUNTRIES. IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER, TWO CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY WILL BE EXAMINED - A REAL CONCEPT AND AN IDEAL CONCEPT-. I AM ASSESSING THE EMPIRICAL ELEMENTS THAT AFFECT THE STRENGTH OF DEMOCRACY IN THE PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION AND THE LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE AND WHICH PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS TO SOCIAL AFFAIRS, POLITICS AND ECONOMY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THE THEORY OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AND ITS RELEVANCE TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. TO UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION, REVISION OF REAL DEMOCRACY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IS REQUIRED. THE PAPER PROPOSES THREE INDICATORS ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE CONCEPT OF REAL DEMOCRACY NEEDS TO BE REVISED. THOSE INDICATORS ARE REGARDED TO BE ESSENTIAL TO LEGITIMIZE GOVERNMENT TODAY: ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPONSIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW.
586	THE DISCRETIONARY POWERS OF WELFARE STATE PROFESSIONALS ARE IN TENSION WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RECHTSSTAAT. EXTENSIVE USE OF DISCRETION CAN THREATEN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RELINQUISH DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS AND POLICIES. THESE TWO TENSIONS ARE IN PRINCIPLE INERADICABLE. BUT DOES THIS ALSO MEAN THAT THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH? ARE THERE MEASURES THAT MAY EASE THESE TENSIONS? WE INTRODUCE AN UNDERSTANDING OF DISCRETION THAT ADDS AN EPISTEMIC DIMENSION (DISCRETION AS A MODE OF REASONING) TO THE COMMON STRUCTURAL UNDERSTANDING OF DISCRETION (AN AREA OF JUDGMENT AND DECISION). ACCORDINGLY WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN STRUCTURAL AND EPISTEMIC MEASURES OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THE AIM OF THE FORMER IS TO CONSTRAIN DISCRETIONARY SPACES OR THE BEHAVIOUR WITHIN THEM WHILE THE AIM OF THE LATTER IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DISCRETIONARY REASONING. THE FOCUS IN THIS ARTICLE IS ON EPISTEMIC MEASURES THAT ARE INTERNALLY RELATED TO THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF ACCOUNTABILITY, NAMELY JUSTIFIED USE OF DISCRETIONARY POWER.
587	IN THE ABSENCE OF SLAVERY, WORKER AND EMPLOYER ENTER INTO AN ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT WHEREBY THE FORMER IS REGULARLY PAID BY THE LATTER. THE SYSTEMATIC NON-PAYMENT OF WAGES IN RUSSIA IS THE MOST TANGIBLE MANIFESTATION OF THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THAT COUNTRY AND REPRESENTS A POTENT OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT: OF EFFECTIVE TRADE UNIONISM. HOWEVER, THE WAGE ISSUE HAS TO BE SET IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WIDER MALAISE OF NONPAYMENT WHICH EXISTS, AND FOR WHICH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT MUST BEAR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE DILEMMAS WHICH THIS SITUATION PRESENTS TO THE UNION MOVEMENT AND SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS OF WHAT CAN AND SHOULD THE UNIONS DO ABOUT THE SITUATION? BECAUSE OF THE DEPTH OF THE CRISIS INFLICTED ON THE ECONOMY BY "SHOCK THERAPY", THE ANSWERS ARE NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS. WHILE NOT ABROGATING THEIR UNION FUNCTIONS, THE TRADE UNIONS MUST SEEK THE SATISFACTION OF REALISABLE POLITICAL DEMANDS.
588	THIS RESEARCH EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE MENA REGION FROM 1996 TO 2022. USING PANEL DATA, IT ASSESSED WHETHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS HAD DIFFERING IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. VARIOUS STATISTICAL METHODS, INCLUDING OLS, GMM, QUANTILE, AND U-TESTS, WERE EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THIS CORRELATION. OUR FINDINGS REVEALED A NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT (INSTITUTIONS AND MARKETS) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, CHARACTERIZED BY AN INVERTED U-SHAPED CURVE. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS INFLUENCED BY THE MENA REGION'S LIMITED FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND THE "VANISHING EFFECT". FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE FOUND TO HAVE AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT PLAYED A ROLE IN CONSTRAINING IT. CONVERSELY, FINANCIAL MARKETS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO GROWTH INITIALLY, BUT THIS EFFECT DIMINISHED OVER TIME, EVENTUALLY TURNING NEGATIVE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIVE INFLUENCES OF LIQUIDITY AND EXPORTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHILE NOTING THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY HAD ADVERSE EFFECTS.
589	CURRENTLY, RAISING THE AWARENESS AND RESPONSIBILITY OF AGENCIES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND CIVIL SERVANTS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE HANDLING OF VIOLATIONS, IN WHICH ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN DISCIPLINE AND DISCIPLINE OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE. HOWEVER, TO RAISE THE AWARENESS AND RESPONSIBILITY OF AGENCIES, ORGANIZATIONS, AND CIVIL SERVANTS IN PERFORMING THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A LEGAL MECHANISM FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC DISCIPLINE. VIETNAM'S LEGAL SYSTEM HAS SPECIFIC REGULATIONS ON DISCIPLINARY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CIVIL SERVANTS, HOWEVER, WHEN DETERMINING ACCOUNTABILITY, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND OBSTACLES. ON THE BASIS OF A STUDY OF VIETNAM'S LEGAL SYSTEM ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND DISCIPLINARY ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CIVIL SERVANTS; THIS STUDY FURTHER CLARIFIES THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE DISCIPLINE OF CIVIL SERVANTS, THEREBY PROPOSING SOME SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE LAW AND FURTHER ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE CIVIL SERVICE DISCIPLINE FOR CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE FUTURE.
590	IN AN INCREASINGLY UNCERTAIN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, IN WHICH WE ARE STILL TRYING TO PUT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BEHIND US WHILE TRYING TO MANAGE THE ILLEGITIMATE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE AS WELL AS THE INCREASINGLY TENSE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, EUROPE, AND JAPAN HAVE REAFFIRMED THEIR HISTORICAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TIES WITH TWO ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS, ONE ECONOMIC AND THE OTHER STRATEGIC, IN FORCE SINCE 2019. IN ADDITION, THE ASIAN CONTINENT HAS BECOME THE GEOPOLITICAL AXIS OF THE WORLD, AND JAPAN WANTS TO PLAY A RELEVANT ROLE THROUGH ITS FREE AND OPEN INDO-PACIFIC (FOIP) INITIATIVE, TO WHICH EUROPE HAS RESPONDED SOMEWHAT HESITANTLY. SHOULD EUROPE AND JAPAN CONTINUE TO DEEPEN THEIR RELATIONSHIP? WHAT ARE THE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT? THE APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK, IN OUR OPINION, SHOULD BE THE "RULES-BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER" OF WHICH THE TWO ACTORS ARE FIRM DEFENDERS, AND THE SHARED VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT UNITE THEM.
591	WHILE NIGERIA'S NATIONAL ASSEMBLY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ASSERTIVE SINCE THE START OF THE FOURTH REPUBLIC, LAWMAKERS CONTINUE TO BE HEAVILY ENGAGED IN CORRUPTION. SUCH RENT-SEEKING PRACTICES ARE COMMONLY REGARDED AS ANTITHETICAL TO DEMOCRATIZATION. IN THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, I ARGUE THAT INDIVIDUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC RENTS ACTUALLY SUPPORTS LEGISLATIVE INDEPENDENCE. BASED ON AN ORIGINAL DATASET OF 8TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MPS (2015-2019), I FIND THAT MEMBERSHIP OF LUCRATIVE COMMITTEES IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED TO THE NUMBER OF BILLS AND MOTIONS SPONSORED. I ALSO SHOW THAT WHILE LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES MAY BE SELF-SERVING, AN IMPORTANT SHARE ALSO APPEAR TO STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RESULT CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT MPS ACCESS TO RENTS IS NOT DETERMINED BY THEIR LOYALTY TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT, BUT RATHER BY THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP AND THE BUREAUCRACY. INCREASED MONETARY POWER IN TURN STRENGTHENS LAWMAKERS TO PLAY A MORE INDEPENDENT ROLE IN POLITICS.
592	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE RECENT DISCOURSE OF TURKEY'S GOVERNING JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AKP) ON THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING DE-EUROPEANISATION IN TURKEY AND THE INCREASING LACK OF CREDIBILITY OF TURKEY'S ACCESSION PROSPECTS. THE ANALYSIS IS INFORMED BY THE DISCOURSE MYTHOLOGICAL APPROACH, WHICH COMBINES THE ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL MYTH WITH CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (IN THIS CASE, THE DISCOURSE HISTORICAL APPROACH). ON THIS BASIS THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE INTERACTION OF AKP DISCOURSE WITH THE EU'S OWN POLITICAL MYTHOLOGY, MOST NOTABLY ITS (SELF) PORTRAYAL AS AN ENTITY FOUNDED ON SO-CALLED 'EUROPEAN' VALUES SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. RECENT AKP DISCOURSE, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO REVERSE THIS DEPICTION OF A TOLERANT, LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC EU BY ARGUING THAT THE EU IS UNABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THE INTOLERANCE AND XENOPHOBIA OF THE EUROPEAN PAST. IN CONTRAST, TURKEY ITSELF IS DEPICTED AS THE TRUE BEARER OF 'EUROPEAN' VALUES.
593	WITH A PRELIMINARY EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE CURRENT SCENARIO OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL STATE ARISING FROM THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE FOSTERS REFLECTIONS ON PARAMETERS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ECOLOGICAL EXISTENTIAL MINIMUM. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE ANALYZED A BIBLIOGRAPHIC COLLECTION THROUGH THE DEDUCTIVE-QUALITATIVE METHOD, WITH RESEARCH ON DOCTRINES, JOURNALS, AND OTHER ACADEMIC AND SCIENTIFIC RESOURCES. THE STUDY CONSISTS OF A LITERATURE REVIEW AIMED TO CONTRIBUTE, IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY, TO GREATER KNOWLEDGE IN THE AREA. FINALLY, FOR HIGHER AWARENESS ON THESE ISSUES, BRIEF NOTES WILL BE ADDRESSED REGARDING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO AN ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED, HEALTHY, ECOWORTHY, AND RESPECTED ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER LIFE FORMS. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE UNQUESTIONABLE CONTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO EXPAND SUCH GUIDELINES AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION, THUS GLIMPSING THE OVERCOMING OF ALIENATIONS AND THE PROMOTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS ON INTERGENERATIONAL COMMITMENT.
594	TRADE POLICY BARRIERS AND HIGH TRANSACTION COSTS HINDER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM TAKING THE FULL ADVANTAGES OF THE GLOBAL TRADING SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO HELP DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVERCOME THE PROBLEM, THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) LAUNCHED THE AID FOR TRADE (AFT) INITIATIVES IN ITS MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE HELD IN HONG KONG IN 2005. WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AFT INFLOWS ON BILATERAL TRADE COSTS FACING 133 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN THEIR LOCATION ON THE CONTOURS OF VARIOUS MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. OUR RESULTS FROM THE ESTIMATION OF A MIXED EFFECTS (RANDOM-INTERCEPT AND RANDOM-COEFFICIENT) MODEL INDICATE THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH AFT REDUCES BILATERAL TRADE COSTS. AN IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATION OF OUR FINDINGS IS THAT AN ECONOMICALLY ROBUST AND SUSTAINABLE REDUCTION IN BILATERAL TRADE COSTS FACING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF BOTH PROMULGATED AND EFFECTIVELY FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS REGULATORY POWER AND THE RULE OF LAW.
595	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY MUNICIPAL POLICE TO CONTAIN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE STATE OF MICHOACAN, MEXICO; SPECIFICALLY IN THE 'HOTLANDS' (TIERRA CALIENTE) IN THE 2000-2017 PERIOD. USING AN ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH BASED ON 35 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH KEY FIGURES AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL, WE FOUND THAT THE POLICE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONTROL THE ADVANCE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH THEY HAVE BECOME ALLIES OF DELINQUENT GROUPS. THE LACK OF LEGITIMACY OF THE POLICE EXPLAINS TO A LARGE EXTENT THEIR INEFFICIENCY. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY FACING MUNICIPAL POLICE FORCES IS TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE-OF-LAW, CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES, AND HAVE THE POLICE ADOPT THE ROLE OF MEDIATORS IN SOCIAL CONFLICTS. IMPLEMENTING STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF POLICE IN MEXICO ALSO DEMANDS ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL.
596	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS ON THE PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN INFRASTRUCTURE (PPI) PROJECTS BY THE TYPE OF GREENFIELD AND BROWNFIELD PROJECTS DURING THE RECENT PERIOD FOR 2002-2017 WITH 117 LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES, BY USING THE PPI AND THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS DATABASE OF THE WORLD BANK. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO ENRICHING THE EVIDENCE BY UPDATING THE SAMPLE TIME-HORIZON AND WIDENING THE COVERAGE OF SAMPLE ECONOMIES, AND BY DECOMPOSING THE PPI PROJECTS INTO GREENFIELD AND BROWNFIELD ONES. THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOW: THE INSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN PROMOTING THE PPI PROJECTS ARE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION; THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS ARE CONFIRMED TO BE GREATER ON THE GREENFIELD PROJECTS THAN ON THE BROWNFIELD ONES; AND THE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS THE MARKET SIZE OF AN ECONOMY ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT PROMOTERS OF THE PPI PROJECTS.
597	ROMA IN MACEDONIA SUFFER FROM DIRE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES DUE TO ECONOMIC FACTORS, SUCH AS HIGH RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY, AND SOCIAL FACTORS, INCLUDING DISCRIMINATION BY MEDICAL PROVIDERS. ALTHOUGH MACEDONIA ADMINISTERS A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR ITS CITIZENS, ROMA FREQUENTLY LACK ACCESS TO THIS SYSTEM IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE RIGHTS TO HEALTH AND EQUALITY ENSHRINED IN MACEDONIA'S CONSTITUTION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. APPLYING A HUMAN RIGHTS IN PATIENT CARE (HRPC) FRAMEWORK TO THIS PROBLEM, WE DISCUSS A FACIALLY NEUTRAL LAW THAT PREDICATED ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE FOR LOW-INCOME CITIZENS ON THE SUBMISSION OF A STATEMENT OF INCOME. THIS REQUIREMENT CREATED ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO CARE, WHICH WE DESCRIBE IN THIS ARTICLE. EVEN AFTER THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECLARED THE REQUIREMENT INVALID, THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE LAW IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE ARGUE THIS FAILURE THREATENED THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY AND FURTHER MARGINALIZED AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ROMA IN VIOLATION OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS.
598	AS IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES, IN AFGHANISTAN FORMAL AND INFORMAL JUSTICE HAVE TRADITIONALLY COMPETED FOR THE MONOPOLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. IN A STRUGGLE THAT BEGAN WITH THE BIRTH OF THE AFGHAN STATE, ITS LEADERS HAVE TRIED TO ASSUME THE MONOPOLY OF JUSTICE, DISPLACING TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS. BEFORE THEM, TRIBES AND CLANS HAVE FRIED TO PRESERVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE FROM THE STATE, RETAINING THE POWER TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE. THE NEW REGIME THAT EMERGED AFTER THE FALL OF THE TALIBAN, INITIALLY CONTINUED THIS TREND, TRYING TO TAKE THE MONOPOLY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. TIME WOULD SHOW THAT INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS, FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, COULD POSE AN ALLY; A POTENTIALLY NECESSARY ALLY. THIS WORK ANALYZES THE RATIONALE LEADING TO THIS CHANGE IN ATTITUDE, AS WELL AS OBSTACLES, ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL SYSTEMS HAVE SHOWN IN AFGHANISTAN.
599	THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IN CHINESE TRADITIONAL THOUGHTS INVOLVES SOME DIFFERENT THEMES AND CONNOTATIONS DUE TO THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF THE TERMS OF "PUBLIC" (GONG) AND "PRIVATE" (SI). AS FAR AS THE CORE NOTION CONCERNED, IT REFERS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE, BETWEEN COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL. CONFUCIANISM HOLDS AN IDEA NAMED "THE WORLD BELONGS TO ALL THE PEOPLE" (TIAN XIA WEI GONG), AND THINKS THAT THE WORLD AND THE STATE AREN'T THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OF SOVEREIGN. THEREFORE, THE SOVEREIGN'S RULE SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE. THIS NEEDS NOT ONLY THE SOVEREIGN'S VIRTUE OF IMPARTIALITY, BUT ALSO ESTABLISHING SOME INSTITUTION. CONFUCIANISM INSISTS THAT THE ESSENTIAL CONCEPTION OF PUBLIC(GONG) LIES IN REALIZING EVERY INDIVIDUALS BASIC INTERESTS AND THEIR BASIC PRIVATE RIGHTS UNIVERSALLY AND SUFFICIENTLY. SINCE THE TRADITIONAL MONARCHY HAMPERED THESE IDEAS TO BE REALIZED, THEN DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ARE INNER REQUIREMENTS OF CONFUCIAN IDEA OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.
600	FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF ODA OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES HAS REDUCED DESTITUTION IN POST-SOCIALIST AND POST-CONFLICT ETHIOPIA. IT HAS ALSO BOOSTED THE TECHNOCRATIC CAPACITY OF EXCLUSIONARY STATE INSTITUTIONS, WHILE DOUBLY ENFEEBLING THE FLEDGLING PRIVATE SECTOR AND INDEPENDENT POLITICAL AND CIVIC ORGANISATIONS. THIS AID-INSTITUTION PARADOX IS A PRODUCT OF AN ALIGNMENT OF DONOR-RECIPIENT STRATEGIC INTERESTS. THE FIVE MAJOR DONORS PURSUED GEOPOLITICAL AND POVERTY REDUCTION OBJECTIVES; AND THE NARROWLY BASED RULING ELITE SOUGHT TOTAL CAPTURE OF THE STATE, OWNERSHIP OF THE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND USE OF PRO-POOR GROWTH TO LEVERAGE LARGE AID INFLOWS AND TO SEEK DOMESTIC POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. BY COUPLING POVERTY REDUCTION WITH ADEQUATE SPACE FOR INCLUSIVE MARKET, CIVIC AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT, A FARSIGHTED COALITION OF DONORS COULD HAVE COMPLEMENTED CAPACITY BUILDING WITH THE PROMOTION OF STATE RESILIENCE. SCALED-UP AID CAN STILL BE DELIVERED, AS IN EASTERN EUROPE, CONDITIONAL ON MEANINGFUL MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
601	MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE 'DEATH OF THE WEST', A DEMISE THREATENED BY THE LOW LEVEL OF REPRODUCTION IN WESTERN COUNTRIES. THAT FATE IS CONTRASTED UNFAVOURABLY WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE POPULATIONS AND ECONOMIES OF LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, AND THE PROSPECT OF THE NUMERICAL AND POLITICAL MARGINALIZATION OF THE FORMERLY DOMINANT DEVELOPED WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT TRENDS IN EUROPEAN FERTILITY HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD AND THAT, WITH EFFORT AND SOME PAIN, THEIR CONSEQUENCES FOR AGE STRUCTURE ARE MANAGEABLE. MANY EUROPEAN SOCIETIES ALSO ENJOY THE ADVANTAGES OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL MATURITY, THE RESILIENCE OF ESTABLISHED CONSENSUAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE SIZES OF CHINA AND INDIA RAISE PROBLEMS OF RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY AND VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. CHINA RISKS FALLING INTO A LOW-FERTILITY TRAP, REINFORCED BY URBAN WORKING CONDITIONS UNFRIENDLY TO FAMILY FORMATION. TRADITIONAL PATRIARCHAL AND FAMILIST CULTURES MAY DEPRESS FERTILITY RATES TO UNHELPFULLY LOW LEVELS IN OTHER LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
602	FEW EMPIRICAL STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED HOW MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS) REACH IMPORTANT SOCIAL GOALS SUCH AS OUTREACH TO THE POOR. WHILE MFIS HAVE THE DUAL GOALS OF PURSUING BOTH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES, THE IMPACT OF THEIR PROFITABILITY ON OUTREACH CAN VARY. BASED ON THE INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS PERSPECTIVE, THIS STUDY PREDICTS THAT IF MFIS FOLLOW COMMERCIAL LOGIC, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO PURSUE HIGH PROFITABILITY RATHER THAN TO INCREASE OUTREACH; HOWEVER, IF MFIS FOLLOW SOCIAL-WELFARE LOGIC, THEY TEND TO TOLERATE RELATIVELY LOW PROFITABILITY AND TRY THEIR BEST TO EXTEND OUTREACH. THEREFORE, IN THE CURVE OF DISTRIBUTION OF MFIS' PROFITABILITY, THERE IS AN INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MFIS' PROFITABILITY AND OUTREACH TO THE POOR. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY A STATE-LEVEL INSTITUTION-THE RULE OF LAW. FOR OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSES, WE USE A DATA SET OF 3,785 ORGANIZATION-YEAR OBSERVATIONS FROM 1,129 MFIS ACROSS 98 COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS OF MULTILEVEL MIXED MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PREDICTIONS.
603	THIS PAPER APPLIES NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATORS TO EXAMINE THE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS-GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIP. BY USING DATA FOR THE TWENTY LARGEST ECONOMIES (GROUP OF TWENTY, G-20) THE DYNAMICS OF THE CONSIDERED RELATIONSHIP ARE ANALYZED FOR THE TIME PERIOD 1996-2010. SIX GOVERNANCE MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ANALYSIS (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AS HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY THE WORLD BANK. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS REVEAL A HIGH NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES' CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND THE EXAMINED GOVERNANCE MEASURES. THE RESULTS REVEAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ON THE NUMBER OF GOVERNANCE MEASURES INFLUENCING COUNTRIES' CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION LEVELS. IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE SUBJECT TO COUNTRIES' SPECIFIC REGIONAL AND DEVELOPMENT VARIATIONS. FINALLY, IT APPEARS THAT INCREASING THE QUALITY OF COUNTRIES' DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE FACTORS DOES NOT ALWAYS RESULT TO LOWER CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION LEVELS. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
604	DISCRETION IS AN INEVITABLE PART OF BUREAUCRATIC ACTION AND TAX DISCRETION IS POSITIONED BETWEEN THE TAX AUTHORITY'S IMMEDIATE CONCERN FOR MAXIMIZING REVENUE AND THE WIDER CONCERN FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE. STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE CONFLICTING CONCERNS IS MORE CHALLENGING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAN IN OTHERS. THE PAPER EXPLORES THE EXTENT OF TAX DISCRETIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) IN BANGLADESH. BASED PRIMARILY ON DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS, THE PAPER ADOPTS A SOCIAL SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE TO ARGUE THAT THE DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN THE BANGLADESH VAT REGIME INFRINGE TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS TO CERTAINTY, TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS AND HENCE THEY REQUIRE AN EFFECTIVE CONTROL MECHANISM FOR CONFINING, STRUCTURING AND CHECKING THESE DISCRETIONS. THE PAPER ALSO ARGUES THAT BESIDES STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE REVENUE AUTHORITY'S DISCRETION AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETIONARY BEHAVIOUR OF THE REVENUE AUTHORITY NEEDS TO BE STREAMLINED BY THE SOCIAL CONTROL THAT ENTAILS A PARADIGM OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AS WELL AS BY SPECIFIC WRITTEN GUIDELINES.
605	GOOD GOVERNANCE IS A BROAD CONCEPT USED BY MANY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO SPELL OUT HOW STATES OR COUNTRIES SHOULD BE GOVERNED. DEFINITIONS VARY, BUT THERE IS A CLEAR CORE OF COMMON PUBLIC VALUES, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY, EFFECTIVENESS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS QUITE LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT NATIONAL VIEWS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE REFLECT DIFFERENT POLITICAL CULTURES AND INSTITUTIONAL HERITAGES. FOURTEEN NATIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT ARE ANALYZED. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC VALUES CONVERGE AND THAT THEY MATCH MODEL CODES FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AS WELL AS CONCEPTIONS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE FROM OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. WHILE VALUES CONVERGE, THEY ARE BALANCED AND COMMUNICATED DIFFERENTLY, AND SEEM TO SOME EXTENT TO BE TRANSLATED INTO THE NATIONAL CULTURES. THE SET OF GLOBAL PUBLIC VALUES DERIVED FROM THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDE PUBLIC INTEREST, REGIME DIGNITY, TRANSPARENCY, NEUTRALITY, IMPARTIALITY, EFFECTIVENESS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND LEGALITY. THE NORMATIVE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AS EXPRESSED IN CODES, SEEMS TO IGNORE THE NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AND REINVENTING GOVERNMENT REFORM MOVEMENTS.
606	BANGLADESH HAS HAD A TROUBLED POLITICAL HISTORY SINCE GAINING INDEPENDENCE IN 1971 AND IS ALSO BELEAGUERED BY POVERTY AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS. IN PARTICULAR HOWEVER, CORRUPTION IS BLIGHTING ITS PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND DAMAGING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS A SECTORAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF CORRUPTION BY EXAMINING PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES OF USING HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES IN BANGLADESH THROUGH A LARGE SCALE QUANTITATIVE SURVEY. IT ALSO PRESENTS CASE STUDY RESEARCH WHICH ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF ANTI-CORRUPTION WORK BY TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL BANGLADESH (TIB) IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT: THE POOREST IN BANGLADESH ARE MOST PENALISED BY CORRUPTION; THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICE USERS RESULTING FROM TIB'S INTERVENTIONS AND THERE IS A NEED FOR COMMITTED POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IF ONGOING EFFORTS TO TACKLE CORRUPTION ARE TO BE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE.

607	BUDDHISM VIEWED GENERICALLY AS A BROAD CHURCH IS A RELIGIO-PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM WHICH PRESENTS A WORLD VIEW. THIS UNDERSTANDING OF BUDDHISM, IT IS ARGUED, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, HAS A BEARING ON CHURCH AND STATE RELATIONS. IN EXPLORING ASPECTS OF RELIGION AND STATECRAFT, THE PAPER ADOPTS A HISTORICAL-DOCTRINAL VIEWPOINTS RATHER THAN ONE BASED ON POPULAR BUDDHISM, I.E., THE DAY TO DAY PRACTICE VIEWED HISTORICALLY. THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY MANIFESTED IN MATTERS OF GOVERNANCE WAS FRAMED WITHIN A SPIRIT OF HUMANISM MARKEDLY EVIDENT IN THE EDICTS OF THE FAMED INDIAN EMPEROR ASOKA. IN MANY RESPECTS BUDDHIST IDEALS OF STATECRAFT EMBODYING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY, PROCEDURES OF GOVERNANCE AND THE SOCIAL POLICIES OF THE ASOKAN WELFARE STATE BEAR A STRIKING SIMILARITY TO ENLIGHTENMENT VALUES IN EUROPE. THIS REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCE OF EAST-WEST DICHOTOMIES, THE PAPER CONCLUDES, MAY CREATE THE SPACE FOR A CIVILIZATIONAL DIALOGUE, NOT A 'CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS.'
608	THE POWER TO PROSCRIBE TERRORIST ORGANISATIONS WAS ONE OF SEVERAL PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE POWERS PUT TO PARLIAMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON US TERRITORY ON 11 SEPTEMBER 2001. SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT OF THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL FOLLOWED A CRITICAL SENATE INQUIRY AFTER WHICH THE POWER WAS INSERTED INTO THE COMMONWEALTH CRIMINAL CODE. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENT HAS WOUND BACK MUCH OF THAT INITIAL REVISION, LEAVING AN EXECUTIVE POWER PERHAPS EVEN MORE POWERFUL THAN ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF THE POWER, PRIMARILY BY CONSIDERING THE APPLICATION OF KEY ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CASE TO THE POWER, AND CONCLUDES THAT IT BREACHES BOTH THE DOCTRINE OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THAT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS THE PROTECTION OFFERED TO CITIZENS AGAINST THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE OF THE POWER AND CONCLUDES THAT NEITHER THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY PARLIAMENT NOR THAT OFFERED BY JUDICIAL REVIEW IS LIKELY TO BE SUFFICIENT TO SALVAGE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY.
609	MOST THEORISTS ASSUME THAT THE CRIMINAL COURTS ARE NEUTRAL ARBITERS OF JUSTICE, PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND COURT RECORDS. THIS ESSAY CHALLENGES THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND EXAMINES THE COURTS AS A PLACE OF PUNITIVE EXCESS AND THE NORMALIZATION OF RACIAL ABUSE AND PUNISHMENT. THE ESSAY EXPLAINS THE HISTORIC ORIGINS OF THESE TRENDS AND EXAMINES HOW THE CATEGORIES OF "HARDENED" AND "MARGINAL" DEFENDANTS BEGAN TO ASSUME RACIALIZED MEANINGS WITH THE EMERGENCE OF MASS INCARCERATION. THIS TRANSFORMED THE CRIMINAL COURTS INTO A TYPE OF PUBLIC THEATER FOR RACIAL DEGRADATION. THESE PUBLIC PERFORMANCES OR "RACIAL DEGRADATION CEREMONIES" OCCUR WITHIN THE DISCRETIONARY PRACTICES AND CULTURAL NORMS OF MOSTLY WHITE COURTROOM PROFESSIONALS AS THEY EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THE DISPOSITION OF CASES IN THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OF LAW. I LINK THESE HISTORICAL FINDINGS TO A RECENT STUDY OF THE LARGEST UNIFIED CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES-COOK COUNTY, CHICAGO-AND DISCUSS COURT WATCHING PROGRAMS AS AN INTERVENTION FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR COURTS AND ITS LEGAL PROFESSIONALS.
610	ABIY AHMED WAS AWARDED THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE IN 2019 FOR HIS ROLE IN INITIATING PEACE TALKS IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE ETHIOPIAN DEMOCRACY. UNDER THE SLOGAN MEDEMER, HE PROMISED HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO UNITE THE MULTI-ETHNIC COUNTRY, RECONCILE CONFLICTS AND BRING BROTHERLY PEACE TO THE COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE TREATS THE WELKAIT QUESTION AS A LITMUS TEST TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN ETHIOPIA. THE IDENTITY QUESTION OF THE INDIGENOUS WELKAIT AMHARA WAS RAISED AND SUPPRESSED SINCE 1991. IN APRIL 2018, THE THEN NEWLY ELECTED ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER ABIY AHMED MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE WELKAIT AMHARA IDENTITY QUESTION COMMITTEE AND PROMISED THAT THIS CASE WOULD BE SOLVED WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. WITHIN THE STRUGGLE FOR RECOGNITION PARADIGM, THIS ARTICLE ASKS IF GOVERNMENT RESPONSES FOLLOW THE MEDEMER APPROACH OF RECONCILIATION, COOPERATION, RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY.
611	THE QUESTION OF EUROPEAN FOREIGN FIGHTERS IN SYRIA HAS TRANSFORMED SECURITY AND COUNTER-RADICALIZATION INTO IMPORTANT PILLARS OF THE LIBERAL SECULAR GOVERNANCE OF MUSLIMS IN EUROPE. BY EXPLORING HOW DUTCH INTEGRATION AND COUNTER-RADICALIZATION POLICIES CONNECT THE IDEA OF DANGER TO MUSLIMS AND ISLAM, DE KONING ANALYSES HOW ADMISSION TO THE DUTCH NATION-STATE IS REGULATED ACCORDING TO WHAT KIND OF DEFICIENCIES OUTSIDERS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE, LOCATING THEM IN IDEAS ABOUT 'RACE', CULTURE AND RELIGION. BY FOCUSING ON THE IDEA OF A RACIALIZATION OF DANGER, DE KONING ARGUES, FIRST, THAT, ALREADY PRIOR TO 9/11, A SECURITIZATION LOGIC EXISTED IN DUTCH POLICIES IN WHICH A FORM OF ISLAM THAT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE 'UNACCEPTABLE' WAS REGARDED AS A POTENTIAL DANGER TO SOCIAL COHESION AND THE RULE OF LAW. AND, SECOND, IN ANALYSING THE PROCESS OF RACIALIZATION, THAT WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ITS AMBIGUITIES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE RACIALIZATION OF MUSLIMS WORKS.
612	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, CONDITIONALLY, BY THE GOOD INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1996-2016. FOR THIS PURPOSE, OUR SURVEY USES THE PEDRONI PANEL COINTEGRATION TEST TO DETECT THE EXISTENCE OF A LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP, FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, AND SYSTEM GMM TO CHECK THE ENDOGENEITY PROBLEM. INDEED, FDI UNACCOMPANIED BY GOOD GOVERNANCE QUALITY (THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND SOUND REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) HAS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OVERALL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND FDI HAS A POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES USING THE FMOLS, DOLS AND S-GMM. THEN THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS AIMING AT ATTRACTING MORE FDI AND THUS IMPROVING THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH NEED TO AMELIORATE THE STRUCTURE GOVERNANCE ADDED TO THEIR BUSINESS CLIMATE.
613	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE MEANING OF THE CONCEPT OF GOOD PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY AND ITS IMPACT ON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE COLOMBIAN CASE. THE PAPER MAKES SOME PRECISIONS ON THE ORIGINS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN THE LIBERAL STATE, TO THEN CONTRAST THESE CHARACTERISTICS WITH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND GOOD PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW OF THE 21ST CENTURY. IT MAKES A PRESENTATION OF THE LEGAL CONTENT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A GOOD PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ITS MAIN CHARACTERISTICS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCHOLARSHIP AND THE MAIN LEGAL DOCUMENTS DEALING WITH THE SUBJECT, SUCH AS THE IBERO-AMERICAN CHARTER OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE CITIZEN IN RELATION TO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF 2013 AND THE EUROPEAN CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF 2000. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW THIS NEW CONCEPT IS APPLIED IN COLOMBIA, REPORTING SOME EXPERIENCES ADOPTED IN THAT COUNTRY WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT.
614	UNDER WTO AND WCO OBLIGATIONS AND ITS OWN INITIATIVES, CHINESE GOVERNMENT, LIKE OTHER GOVERNMENTS, ESPECIALLY CHINA CUSTOMS, IN THE RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE TRADE AND CUSTOMS PROCESS TO FACILITATE LEGITIMATE TRADE OF EFFICIENCY AND PROTECT PUBLIC INTEREST FOR COMPLIANCE. THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE NATIONALLY INTEGRATED CUSTOMS CLEARANCE PROCESS, ARE WELCOMED BY THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMUNITY THOUGH, UNCERTAINTIES AND CONCERNS REMAIN, PARTICULARLY ON NON-TARIFF TECHNICAL BARRIERS, TRANSPARENCY, CONSISTENCY, PERFORMANCE, AND STABILITY FOR RULING-MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION. WITH ALL THE PILOT PROGRAMS AND REFORM INITIATIVES ON INFORMED CUSTOMS AND TRADE FACILITATION AND COMPLIANCE, WE PROPOSE THAT A NEW ROUND CUSTOMS LAW AND REGULATION REVIEW, MODERNIZATION AND REVISION IS TIMELY DEMANDED FOR RULE OF LAW, LEGITIMACY, CONSISTENCY OF THE REFORMS. WE ENCOURAGE THE TRADE COMMUNITY, AT THE SAME TIME OF ENJOYING THE TRADE FACILITATION ADVANTAGES, TO INVEST AND IMPLEMENT IN CUSTOMS AND TRADE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, INCLUDING PROMISE, POLICY, PROCESS, PROCEDURE AND PEOPLE, TO AVOID COSTS ARISING FROM CUSTOMS AND TRADE COMPLIANCE CRISIS.
615	THIS ARTICLE IS A REFLECTIVE STUDY ON JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE QUEST FOR ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN COLOMBIA, WHICH AIMS TO EXPOSE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR ALL RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, IN COUNTRIES LIKE COLOMBIA THAT LEGITIMACY IS QUESTIONED, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLIC POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON REMOVING BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE, SUCH AS THE COST OF LITIGATION, EXCESSIVE FORMALISM, LACK EDUCATION RIGHTS, GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITATIONS, THE POWER OF THE LITIGANTS AND OTHER BARRIERS THAT PLAGUE SOCIETY. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE ACCENTUATED WITH THE PECULIARITIES OF THE COLOMBIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM, AS IT IS THE LEGAL PATRONAGE AND THE DECLINE OF THE STATE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY TO DISPENSE JUSTICE, SO HAVE BECOME THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO DISCUSS A REFORM OF THE JUSTICE THAT FOCUSES ON OPEN ACCESS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PERSONS, NECESSITATING A DISCUSSION ON THE CHALLENGES OF A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY BASED ON THE CITIZEN TO ENTER THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
616	CONTRACTING OUT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AS A STRATEGY FOR PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT FOR REDUCING COSTS, ALLEVIATING THE BURDEN ON GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PROVIDING SERVICES, AS WELL AS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PRACTICES THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. GENERALLY, THE SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT IN CAPITALIST LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT THAT EMPHASIZE RULE OF LAW, TRANSPARENCY, PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE MORE EFFICIENT, WHILE SOCIALIST REGIMES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE INEFFICIENT DUE TO THE LACK OF THESE FEATURES. THIS ARTICLE COMPARES TWO DISSIMILAR CASES OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION AND SHENZHEN SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE OF CHINA. AN EXAMINATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACT IN THE AREA OF PUBLIC HOUSING IN THESE CITIES REVEAL THAT THE SOCIALIST CITY OF SHENZHEN HAS ACHIEVED A HIGHER LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY, WHILE CAPITALIST HONG KONG LAGS BEHIND IN ESTABLISHING AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACTS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. THE FINDING CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO EFFICIENCY UNDER DIFFERENT IDEOLOGICAL REGIMES.
617	CENTRAL TO THE POST-CONFLICT DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN MOZAMBIQUE, THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE NATIONAL POLICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. FROM 2000, FAILURES TO DEMOCRATISE THE POLICE DURING THE 1990S LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF COMMUNITY POLICING, WHICH, IT WAS PROMISED, COULD ENGENDER 'A NEW CULTURE OF SECURITY' OF POLICE-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, CITIZEN INCLUSION AND ACCOUNTABLE STATE POLICING. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW STATE-INITIATED COMMUNITY POLICING WAS IMPLEMENTED IN A RURAL FORMER WAR-ZONE. BASED ON ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK IT ASKS WHAT LOCAL VERSIONS OF COMMUNITY POLICING MEANS FOR EVERYDAY POLICING PRACTICES AND WHERE THIS IS TAKING POLICE-CITIZEN RELATIONS. IT SHOWS THAT COMMUNITY POLICING WAS PRINCIPALLY USED BY THE LOCAL POLICE TO EXPAND STATE POLICE OUTREACH AND REASSERT SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY BY OUTSOURCING EXTRA-LEGAL TASKS TO YOUNG MEN. THE RESULT IS RECONFIGURED FORMS OF PHYSICAL AND SYMBOLIC POLICE VIOLENCE, WHICH REPRODUCE SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF PAST PARAMILITARY POLICING CULTURES.
618	WE TEND TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS THE DISCRETIONARY POWER, THROUGH ITS USE OF THE WRIT OF CERTIORARI, TO SELECT THE CASES IT WISHES TO DECIDE. THE COURT, HOWEVER, HAS NOT ALWAYS POSSESSED THIS DISCRETION. PROFESSOR HARTNETT TRACES THE HISTORY OF CERTIORARI IN THE COURT, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE UNPRECEDENTED EFFORTS OF CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT TO PROMOTE THE LANDMARK JUDGES' BILL OF 1925 AND THE UNCRITICAL DEFERENCE TO THE COURT SHOWN BY CONGRESS IN ENACTING IT. AFTER DESCRIBING WAYS IN WHICH THE COURT ASSERTED EVEN BROADER DISCRETION THAN CONGRESS PROVIDED, PROFESSOR HARTNETT QUESTIONS WHETHER CERTIORARI IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, THE NATURE OF JUDICIAL POWER, AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE QUESTIONING CERTIORARI, HE EMPHASIZES ITS IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY IN ENCOURAGING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO THINK OF THEMSELVES AS FINAL ARBITERS OF CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS BUT ALSO IN SHAPING SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
619	THE ANALYSIS OF DATA AND INFORMATION ON THE WEB HAS DEVELOPED INTO A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL FOR CATALOGUING FILES, PERSONAL CATEGORIES OR CLASSIFYING OBJECTIVES THAT UNLEASH A WIDE RANGE OF BENEFITS IN THE MOST VARIED FIELDS OF APPLICABILITY. THIS TECHNIQUE IS ALSO VERY USEFUL IN THE FIELD OF TAX ENFORCEMENT. IT CAN BE SAID THAT IN A DEVELOPED AND HIGHLY GLOBALISED SOCIETY THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TAX SYSTEM CANNOT BE IMMUNE TO THIS PHENOMENON. THIS IS BECAUSE, THROUGH THE ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF DATA IN DATABASES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAXIMISE THE ACTS AIMED AT CONTROL AND SUPERVISION OVER THE ACTIONS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS IN TAX MANAGEMENT ACTS. THROUGH THIS MASSIVE CATALOGUING IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT TO MITIGATE PHENOMENA SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL TAX EVASION AND FRAUD. HOWEVER, LIMITS AND PROBLEMS MUST BE IDENTIFIED, WHICH CANNOT BE NEGLECTED IN A RULE OF LAW, CALLING FOR IMPORTANT LIMITS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE ANALYTICAL MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD TAXPAYERS' LEGALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS AND INTERESTS.
620	THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON BANK DEPOSIT GROWTH BESIDES BANK-SPECIFIC AND MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES IN EUROPEAN TRANSITION ECONOMIES. GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) IS APPLIED TO ANALYZE THE PANEL DATA WHICH IS COLLECTED FROM THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS OF WORLD BANK OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2017. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY STRENGTHENS THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF DEPOSIT MOBILIZATION ON BANK DEPOSIT GROWTH. SPECIFICALLY, RULE OF LAW IS FOUND TO HAVE A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH BANK DEPOSIT. IN ADDITION, MACROECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING BROAD MONEY SUPPLY (M2) AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (RGDP) ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN BANK DEPOSIT GROWTH. HOWEVER, BANK-SPECIFIC FACTORS COMPRISING BANK EFFICIENCY AND BANK BRANCH EXPANSION DO NOT INFLUENCE BANK DEPOSIT GROWTH. ACCORDINGLY, THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY PROPOSE A CORE MESSAGE THAT TRANSITION COUNTRIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS SINCE THESE MAJOR INDICATORS COULD PROMOTE AND STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF BANK FUNDING.
621	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES AND DEVELOPS A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF ARGUMENTS DEMONSTRATING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF DRUG PROHIBITION POLICIES IN MEXICO. SOME OF THESE ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN USED TO VALIDATE RECREATIONAL AND THERAPEUTIC USES OF MARIJUANA, WHILE OTHERS REMAIN UNUSED AND UNEXPLORED. THERE ARE MORE THAN TEN CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMINGS THAT ARE USEFUL TO EVALUATE THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF PROHIBITIONIST DRUG POLICIES. THESE FRAMINGS CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO SUBCATEGORIES: RIGHTS-CENTERED AND NON-RIGHTS CENTERED. RIGHTS-CENTERED FRAMINGS ARE GROUNDED ON EQUALITY, HEALTH, AND THE FREE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERSONALITY. NON-RIGHTS-CENTERED FRAMINGS INCLUDE FEDERALISM, MARKET REGULATION AND PRESERVATION OF BASIC RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES. THIS PAPER DETAILS RESOURCES THAT MAY BE HELPFUL FOR JUDGES, POLICY MAKERS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN A HUMAN-RIGHTS OR CONSTITUTIONAL BASED APPROACH TO DRUG POLICY. AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY OF MEXICO REVEALS USEFUL ARGUMENTS TO EVALUATE THE LEGAL STATUS OF DRUG POLICY IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.
622	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF HUMANITARIANISM, AND THE REFUGEE REGIME RESHAPES REFUGEE LAWYERING. MUCH REFUGEE LAWYERING IS BASED ON A TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL PROTECTION - AND A FOCUS ON LEGAL AID, LAW REFORM ADVOCACY, AND SPECIFIC PROTECTION PROCEDURES (SUCH AS REFUGEE STATUS DETERMINATION). REFUGEE LAWYERING MUST NOW GRAPPLE WITH THE CHALLENGES OFFERED BY THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION. THIS ENTAILS IDENTIFYING EMERGENT PROTECTION ISSUES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE LAW AND LEGAL CLAIMS. TO THAT END, THE ARTICLE PUTS FORWARD SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE RISKS OF THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AS IT PERTAINS TO THE HUMANITARIAN SPACE, THE REFUGEE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND REFUGEE LAWYERING. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT LAW MAY BE "DISPLACED" BY TECHNOLOGY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING WHAT IT MEANS FOR REFUGEE LAWYERING AND FOR BEING ACCOUNTABLE TO THE NORMS AND VALUES OF RULE OF LAW STANDARDS, INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION, AND TO INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS.
623	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE INFLUENCE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ON FIRM INNOVATION IN TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEES) BY EXPLICITLY DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY AS DISTINCT INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS. WE INTEGRATE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND LEGITIMACY THEORY TO EXPLAIN THAT THE FAILURE OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT OF CORRUPTION WHICH ENCOURAGES FIRMS TO USE BRIBES TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC EXCHANGE. WE TEST OUR HYPOTHESES ON THE INNOVATION PERFORMANCE OF A SAMPLE (N = 1603) OF FIRMS IN 11 CEES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WEAK RULE OF LAW AND INEFFECTIVE BUSINESS REGULATIONS IN CEES PROPAGATE THE PERCEPTION OF CORRUPTION THAT INHIBITS FIRM INNOVATION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF BRIBERY ENABLES FIRMS TO TRANSFORM THIS ENVIRONMENT OF CORRUPTION INTO INNOVATION OUTCOMES. THE POLICY AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS OF OUR RESEARCH FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY AND OUR FINDINGS THAT BRIBERY ACTS AS THE GLUE THAT BINDS FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ARE FULLY DISCUSSED.
624	THIS IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON POST-GFC BANK RISK-TAKING BEHAVIOR. THIS STUDY IS CONDUCTED ON 730 BANKS FROM 19 EMERGING COUNTRIES COVERING THE PERIOD 2011-2016. WE USED SIX INDICATORS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AS A PROXY FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. BOTH STATIC PANEL AND DYNAMIC GMM ESTIMATION ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF THESE VARIABLES ON BANK RISK-TAKING; MEASURED BY Z-SCORE. WE EVIDENCED THAT INCREASING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CONTROLLING CORRUPTION, AND IMPROVING AGENTS' CONFIDENCE AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW REDUCE BANKS' RISK EXPOSURE AND IMPROVE BANKS' STABILITY. BESIDES SUPPORTING THE Z-SCORE MODEL, THE ROBUSTNESS TEST USING SIGMA(NIM) ALSO PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY QUALITY ON REDUCING BANK RISK. SURPRISINGLY, BOTH MODELS TEND TO INDICATE THAT IMPROVING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY INCREASE BANK RISK-TAKING IN EMERGING COUNTRIES. FURTHERMORE, OUR STUDY PROVIDES AN INTERESTING RECONCILIATION TO THE MAJOR DEBATE ON THE IMPACT OF SIZE ON BANK RISK.
625	JUDICIAL POWER IS CENTRAL TO DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. PUBLIC SUPPORT IS CRITICAL FOR ESTABLISHING AND PROTECTING IT. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT THIS SUPPORT IS ROOTED IN APOLITICAL FACTORS AND NOT DEPENDENT ON WHO IS IN POLITICAL POWER. BY CONTRAST, WE ARGUE THAT SUPPORT MAY BE DRIVEN BY INSTRUMENTAL PARTISAN MOTIVATIONS AND THEREFORE LINKED TO PARTISAN ALIGNMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE. WE TEST THE ARGUMENT WITH SURVEY EVIDENCE FROM 34 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO PROVIDE CAUSAL EVIDENCE, WE CONDUCT DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ANALYSES LEVERAGING GHANA'S THREE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITIONS SINCE 2000. ACROSS AFRICA, SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL POWER IS HIGH, WHILE TRUST IN COURTS IS LOWER. HOWEVER, PRESIDENTIAL CO-PARTISANS ARE LESS SUPPORTIVE OF HORIZONTAL JUDICIAL POWER OVER THE PRESIDENT AND MORE SUPPORTIVE OF VERTICAL POWER OVER THE PEOPLE. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTISAN ALIGNMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE IN SHAPING SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL POWER, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR AND LEGITIMACY.
626	CERTAIN MARINE LIVING RESOURCES OF SOUTH AFRICA ARE UNDER SEVERE THREAT FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME SYNDICATES IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL FISHERS. THESE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES ERODE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND LEAD TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEGRADATION AND THE PROLIFERATION OF GANGSTERISM. THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT APPROACH AS CUSTODIANS OF THE RESOURCES IS TO MAXIMISE THE RETURN FROM CONFISCATIONS. SAPS ARE NOT USING THE FULL POWER OF THE LAW TO ADDRESS POACHING OF MARINE LIVING RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY ABALONE, AS A PRIORITY CRIME AND DO NOT ALLOCATE THEIR RESOURCES COMMENSURATE WITH THE VALUE OF THE COMMODITY. AS A COUNTRY THAT IS BELEAGUERED BY FISHERIES CRIME, OVERFISHING AND EXPLOITATION, SOUTH AFRICA MUST TAKE A TOUGH STANCE AND SHOULD PURSUE CRIMINAL ORGANISATIONS WITH ALL THE POWER THAT THE STATE CAN MUSTER. IT MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT NATIONAL FISHERIES RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS IMPROVED SO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN BENEFIT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CONFORMING STRATEGY WOULD BE SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY UNPOPULAR, BUT THE FUTURE BENEFITS WILL OUTWEIGH THE OUTLAY.
627	THE EXISTENCE OF PUBLIC VALUES, AND THEREFORE OF PUBLIC MORALS, IS AN INTRINSIC CHARACTERISTIC OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE "THE MINIMUM VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY" (WEINSTOCK, "L'ACTUALITE DU BIEN COMMUN", 2004). HOWEVER, THIS COLLECTIVE ETHIC MUST CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENT OF NEUTRALITY, WHICH, IN A PLURALIST DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, IS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF BOTH INTENTION AND JUSTIFICATION. HOW THEN, IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE MET, TO JUSTIFY THE GRANTING OF EXEMPTIONS, RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL ETHICS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THIS COLLECTIVE ETHICS? BASED ON OUR FIELD OF RESEARCH (THE CONTEMPORARY USE OF THE OBJECTION WITHIN MORAL CRUSADES), WE WILL DEFEND THE IDEA THAT THEY SHOULD BE USED IN A RESTRICTIVE WAY. THEY ARE INDEED PART OF A DYNAMIC OF INTERSUBJECTIVITY, WHICH COULD HAVE BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE CONSEQUENCES. THEY COULD EVEN LEAD US TO QUESTION THE FRAMEWORK MAKING POSSIBLE INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMIES. EXEMPTION, THEREFORE, IS ONLY JUSTIFIED IF IT ALLOWS THE CONCILIATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
628	OVER THE DECADES, THERE HAS BEEN A RECURRENT AND SUSTAINED ARGUMENT THAT THE NIGERIAN STATE, LIKE ITS COUNTERPARTS IN AFRICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD, UNDERPERFORMS DUE TO LACK OF STATE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THE CONTEMPORARY COMPLEXITIES OF GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STATE OF GOVERNANCE IN NIGERIA AND ASSESSES THE FACTORS MILITATING AGAINST THE PROMOTION OF PUBLIC GOOD AND EFFECTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE DRAWS DATA FROM SECONDARY AND PRIMARY SOURCES, WHICH INCLUDE THE AUTHORS' CLOSE OBSERVATIONS OF EVENTS IN NIGERIA. GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN NIGERIA HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY SELF-INTEREST AND OTHER PRIMORDIAL CONSIDERATIONS, WHICH TAKE PRIORITY OVER THAT OF THE PUBLIC. THE STATE HAS FAILED IN THREE MAJOR AREAS: SECURITY OF LIVES AND PROPERTIES, PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROVISION OF VISIONARY LEADERSHIP. IN CONCLUSION, THE NATURE AND CHARACTERS OF THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP EXPLAINS THE NIGERIAN STATE INCAPACITY FOR EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE.
629	THIS PAPER APPLIES THE STATISTICAL CONCEPTS OF SIGMA-CONVERGENCE AND UNCONDITIONAL BETA-CONVERGENCE TO INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN SEVERAL COUNTRY GROUPS HIERARCHIZED TO THE DEGREE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION (E.G., EURO AREA). TWO SETS OF INDICATORS ARE EMPLOYED TO MEASURE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: FIRST, THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, AND SECOND, THE PRODUCT MARKET REGULATION INDICATOR OF THE OECD AND THE DOING BUSINESS DISTANCE TO FRONTIER INDICATOR OF THE WORLD BANK. THE AUTHORS CAN CLEARLY CONFIRM INSTITUTIONAL BETA-CONVERGENCE WITHIN THE EU AND ITS ASPIRANTS, WHICH IS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE NEW MEMBER STATES AND ACCEDING, CANDIDATE, AND POTENTIAL CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, EURO-AREA COUNTRIES CONVERGE ONLY IN THE AREA OF PRODUCT MARKET AND BUSINESS REGULATION-NOT IN THE AREA OF GOVERNANCE. IN FACT, THE AUTHORS SHOW EVIDENCE FOR BETA-DIVERGENCE IN RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE FIRST TWELVE EURO-AREA MEMBERS. CONCERNING SIGMA-CONVERGENCE, THE RESULTS ARE LESS CLEAR. ONLY THE EU INCLUDING THE EU-ASPIRANTS REDUCED THE CROSS-COUNTRY VARIANCE IN ALL ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
630	TENURE IS AN IMPORTANT FACET OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND A KEY PRINCIPLE UNDERPINNING THE RULE OF LAW, YET ITS PROTECTION VARIES MARKEDLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPIRICAL EXPERIENCE OF THREE PREEMINENT APPELLATE COURTS-THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA-AS EXAMPLES OF PREVALENT MODELS OF TENURE, NAMELY, LIFE TENURE, AGE LIMITS AND TERM LIMITS. DISSATISFACTION WITH TENURE ARRANGEMENTS IN EACH JURISDICTION HAS BEEN IMPELLED BY INCREASING HUMAN LONGEVITY, GROWING AWARENESS OF INCAPACITIES THAT ACCOMPANY AGEING AND CHANGING ATTITUDES TO AGE DISCRIMINATION. THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE LED TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS TO AMELIORATE THE PROBLEMS THAT INHERE IN DIFFERENT MODELS OF TENURE. HOWEVER, THE CHOICE BETWEEN MODELS, AND BETWEEN KEY PARAMETERS WITHIN EACH MODEL, REFLECT COMPLEX POLICY PREFERENCES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT HYBRID ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCORPORATE AGE LIMITS AND TERM LIMITS PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE COMPROMISE BETWEEN COMPETING POLICY OBJECTIVES.
631	COURT-BASED CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW AS A WAY OF CONTROLLING EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN POST SECOND WORLD WAR LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE WORLD. 1 CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE PRESERVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN INDEPENDENT. CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS ARE PERCEIVED AS IMPORTANT FACTORS OF STABILIZATION IN MANY COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY NEW OR FRAGILE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. 2 DUE TO THEIR POTENTIAL ROLE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS HAVE BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY STUDIED IN THE AREA OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND POLITICS. 3 IN THIS STUDY, THE TURKISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST ACTIVE IN EUROPE, WILL BE EXAMINED IN A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE BY CONSIDERING THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.
632	THE STATE, RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY ARE THE THREE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A MODERN POLITICAL ORDER. THE STATE CONCENTRATES AND USES POWER, WHILE LAW AND DEMOCRACY CONSTRAIN THE EXERCISE OF POWER, INDICATING THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT TENSION BETWEEN THEM. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY INTERACT IN THREE AREAS: CITIZEN SECURITY, PATRONAGE AND CLIENTELISM, AND THE FORMATION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY. IN ALL THREE AREAS, STATE AND DEMOCRACY ACT AT CROSS PURPOSES IN SOME DOMAINS, AND ARE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE IN OTHERS. THE REASON FOR THIS COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP IS THAT BOTH STATE AND DEMOCRACY ARE THEMSELVES COMPLEX COLLECTIONS OF INSTITUTIONS WHICH INTERACT ON A MULTIPLICITY OF LEVELS. UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND DEMOCRACY IS IMPORTANT IN POLICY TERMS BECAUSE MANY RECENT INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE ASSUME THAT STATE QUALITY AND DEMOCRACY ARE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE, SOMETHING THAT IS NOT FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE.
633	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER MANDATORY IFRS ADOPTION AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL LOWERS U. S. INVESTORS' PROPENSITY TO OVERWEIGHT DOMESTIC STOCKS IN THEIR COMMON STOCK PORTFOLIOS (GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS HOME BIAS). WE FIND THAT, ON AVERAGE, U. S. HOME BIAS DECREASES FOR COUNTRIES THAT MANDATE IFRS ADOPTION, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COUNTRY-FIXED EFFECTS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE REDUCTION IN THE U. S. HOME BIAS AFTER THE MANDATORY ADOPTION OF IFRS IS GREATER FOR COUNTRIES WITH LARGER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND THEIR DOMESTIC ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, FOR COUNTRIES WITH A STRICTER RULE OF LAW AND A COMMON LAW LEGAL ORIGIN, AND IN COUNTRIES WITH GREATER INCENTIVES TO REPORT HIGH-QUALITY FINANCIAL INFORMATION. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT A COMMON SET OF GLOBAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MATTERS FOR PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS OF U. S. INVESTORS AND THAT U. S. INVESTORS REGARD THE ENFORCEMENT OF STANDARDS TO BE A KEY FACTOR IN MAKING INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE THE U.S.
634	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC). THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ROME STATUTE OF THE ICC, AS WELL AS THOSE GOVERNING ITS FUNCTIONING, ARE FULLY IN LINE WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE UNION. THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL AS THE PRESERVATION OF PEACE AND THE STRENGTHENING OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO, AND A PRIORITY FOR, THE UNION, IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND AS PROVIDED FOR IN ARTICLES 2 AND 3 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION. THE SERIOUS CRIMES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE ICC ARE OF GREAT CONCERN FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH IS COMMITTED TO CO-OPERATION TO PREVENT SUCH CRIMES AND TO END IMPUNITY FOR THE PERPETRATORS. THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH FEATURES OF LEGAL REGULATION AND ACTIVITY OF THE EU ON IMPLEMENTING THE ROME STATUTE OF THE ICC AND SUPPORTING ITS FUNCTIONING.
635	JUST THIRTY YEARS OLD, WHEN HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE THE UNIVERSITY FOR REFUSING TO SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THE FASCIST REGIME, EDOARDO RUFFINI HAD ALREADY FULLY COMPLETED THE MOST ORIGINAL AND FERTILE STRETCH OF HIS EXPERIENCE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. CONSUMED IN FOUR YEARS, BETWEEN 1924 AND 1927, ABOUT A COMMON THEME OF INQUIRY - THE HISTORY OF THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE - IT IS STILL A WITNESS AT ALL ISOLATED IN THE PANORAMA OF ITALIAN LEGAL HISTORY. THIS PAPER, AFTER A BRIEF PRESENTATION OF THE INTELLECTUAL BIOGRAPHY OF THE AUTHOR, TRACES THE THEMES OF GREATEST INTEREST IN HIS WORK TO A HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT AND INSTITUTIONS OF ITALY DURING MIDDLE AGES: PERIOD THAT RUFFINI RECOGNIZED AS FUNDAMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DYNAMICS THAT ALLOWED MAJORITY PRINCIPLE TO ASSERT ITSELF (EVEN BEFORE THAT AS A RULE OF LAW) AS A PRACTICE OF POLITICAL ACTION OVER OTHER METHODS OF DELIBERATION, BOTH WITHIN THE CHURCH AND, SINCE HIS VERY FIRST APPEARANCES, IN THE AMBIT OF COMMUNAL ASSEMBLIES AND CONSULATES.
636	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE LIMITS OF THE FREEDOM OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN TURKEY. THE POLITICAL PARTY BANS CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THREATENING THE FREEDOM OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN TURKEY. THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE POLITICAL PARTIES COME TO THE FORE IN TWO DIFFERENT FORMS: DISSOLUTION AFTER THE MILITARY COUPS AND CLOSURE BY MEANS OF LEGISLATION. IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF THE CASE OPENED AGAINST THE AK PARTY, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE AND ADVISABLE TO APPLY AN AMENDMENT, BRINGING TURKISH JURISPRUDENCE IN SUCH MATTERS IN LINE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHOULD INTERPRET CASES OF THE DISSOLUTION OF POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF "SECULARISM" AND THE "UNITARY STATE" IN SUCH A WAY AS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF "THE RULE OF LAW" AND TO ALLOW DIFFERENT POLITICAL ALIGNMENTS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN A "HUMAN RIGHTS RESPECTING" AND "DEMOCRATIC" COUNTRY.
637	THIS IS THE REVISED DRAFT OF THE OPENING LECTURE GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR AT THE 2004 CONFERENCE OF ITALIAN SOCIETY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE IN PADUA. IN THE FIRST SECTION THE MAIN DEFINITIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES RULE OF LAW, ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY, INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPONSIVENESS, FREEDOM AND EQUALITY/SOLIDARITY ARE DISCUSSED. IN THE SECOND A KEY QUESTION IS ADDRESSED: IF WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE QUALITIES OF A DEMOCRACY HOW MUCH ARE THE PREVIOUS POLITICAL TRADITIONS OF THE COUNTRY RELEVANT? OTHER EXPLANATORY FACTORS, WHICH COMPLEMENT THE ROLE OF TIN AUTHORITARIAN LEGACY, ARE ALSO SUGGESTED AND A FEW KEY HYPOTHESES ARE PROPOSED. THE FINAL SECTION DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION, BUT ANALYSES OF THE IMPACT OF AUTHORITARIAN LEGACY IN A FEW COUNTRIES OF SOUTHERN EUROPE, SUCH AS PORTUGAL, SPAIN, AND ITALY (BUT NOT GREECE WHERE IT IS NOT RELEVANT) AND IN THE SOUTHERN CONE AS CHILE, ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, BRAZIL, WHERE THE QUALITY OF CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACIES IS QUESTIONED.
638	RISK MANAGEMENT INVOLVES TRACKING MARKET AND NON-MARKET LONG-RANGE RISKS, UNDERSTANDING THEIR ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND MANAGERIAL RESPONSES TO REDUCE RISK EXPOSURE. AS AN EMERGING MARKET, SOUTH AFRICA POSES A CHALLENGING ARRAY OF LONG-TERM POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS TO INVESTORS. RISKS SUCH AS CONCERNS ABOUT INCREASED COSTS, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, LIMITED CAPACITY TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, A VOLATILE CURRENCY, REGIONAL CONTAGION AND THE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC HEIGHTEN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. MANAGERIAL RESPONSES TO ANTICIPATE AND MITIGATE RISKS INCLUDE MATCHING MODE OF ENTRY WITH RISK TOLERANCE, SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE AND LOBBYING, MAINTAINING LOW TOLERANCE FOR CORRUPTION, SELECTING APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND BALANCING SHAREHOLDER AND STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS. THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PRESENTED, CONSISTING OF THREE ELEMENTS: TYPE OF RISK, IMPACT OF RISKS AND MANAGERIAL RESPONSE TO COUNTER ADVERSE RISK IMPACTS, MAY BE REFINED AND EXPANDED FOR POTENTIAL APPLICATION TO OTHER EMERGING MARKETS.

639	WHAT DO CITIZENS AND POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE IN MIND WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY? THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY AMONG BOTH ORDINARY CITIZENS AND POLITICAL ELITES IN TWO POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES, RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. DATA COLLECTED THROUGH PERSONAL INTERVIEWS IN 1992 AND 1995 REVEAL THAT THE MASS AND ELITE IN THESE POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES HOLD DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY. THE ELITE TEND TO EMPHASIZE LAW AND ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS THE CITIZENS STRESS FREEDOMS IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY. INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS, ESPECIALLY IN A POLITICAL PARTY, HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS ON THE CONSISTENCY AMONG ATTITUDES REFLECTING SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY ARE ALSO FOUND TO AFFECT THE PERCEIVED EXTENT TO WHICH THE CURRENT REGIME FITS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL'S IDEA OF WHAT A DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE LIKE.
640	THE PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS OF DEVELOPMENT IN ANY COUNTRY AND IT IS ALSO AN INDICATOR OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN VIETNAM, THERE ARE 54 ETHNIC GROUPS, OF WHICH 53 ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES; THESE ETHNIC MINORITIES ARE MOSTLY LOCATED IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AREAS, RUGGED TERRAIN, AND UNDERDEVELOPED SOCIAL -ECONOMIC. .. SO THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND LEGAL AWARENESS IS STILL DIFFICULT AND LIMITED. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE RESEARCH AUTHORS ANALYZE THE THEORETICAL ISSUES OF JUSTICE ACCESS AND LEGAL AWARENESS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES; RESEARCH LEGAL SERVICES; RESEARCH COAXIAL ALIGNMENT. THEREBY THE AUTHORS PROPOSE A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES OF ETHNIC MINORITIES IN VIETNAM. THE ARTICLE IS A RESEARCH RESULT UNDER THE TOPIC: 'BASIC AND URGENT ISSUES IN THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS IN ETHNIC MINORITY AND MOUNTAINOUS AREAS OF OUR COUNTRY', CODE CTDT.49.18 / 16-20
641	CITIZENSHIP IS A UNIVERSAL LEGAL CONCEPT AND NORM. BUT ITS MEANING AND IMPACT DIFFER. ITS CODIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION ARE SHAPED BY HISTORICAL TRAJECTORIES, POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND STATE/GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. STATE POLICY AFFECTS PERCEPTIONS OF CITIZENSHIP AND CIVIC BEHAVIOUR BY THOSE GOVERNED. THIS PAPER ENGAGES WITH CURRENT CHALLENGES RELATING TO CITIZENSHIP IN AFRICA SOUTH OF THE SAHARA. IT CENTRES ON ACADEMIC AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON CITIZENSHIP BUT ALSO DRAWS ON MEDIA REPORTS AND SECONDARY LITERATURE TO EXPLORE WHETHER PROMOTING AND EMBRACING A POSITIVE NOTION OF CITIZENSHIP CAN BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES AND GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS CITIZENS. COULD CIVIC EDUCATION BE CONSIDERED A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT IN SOCIAL STABILITY AND A SHARED IDENTIFICATION WITH THE COMMON GOOD? WE CONCLUDE BY MAKING A CASE FOR A SOCIAL CONTRACT, WHICH RECONCILES PARTICULARISTIC IDENTITIES (SUCH AS ETHNICITY) WITH CITIZENSHIP AND GOVERNANCE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AS AN INVESTMENT INTO ENHANCED TRUST IN A CITIZEN-STATE RELATIONSHIP.
642	THE IMPENDING CLOSE TO THE WAR IN SYRIA BRINGS TO THE FORE THE PROSPECT OF APPROXIMATELY 13 MILLION FORCIBLY DISPLACED PEOPLE CONSIDERING RETURNS TO PLACES OF ORIGIN IN THE COUNTRY. HOWEVER THE REATTACHMENT OF PEOPLE TO THEIR HOUSING, LAND AND PROPERTY (HLP) FACES A DAUNTING SET OF CHALLENGES-THE PROSPECT OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE, THE APPLICATION OF EXPROPRIATION LAWS, CONFISCATIONS AND POLITICAL AGENDAS. GREATLY AGGRAVATING THESE CHALLENGES IS THE REALITY THAT THERE WILL NOW NOT BE AN INTERNATIONALLY SUPERVISED AND FINANCED HLP RESTITUTION PROCESS APPLYING ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS IS THE NORM AFTER WARS. INSTEAD, FORMS OF LAND TENURE RESILIENCE WILL BECOME A PRIMARY INFLUENCE IN FACILITATING RESTITUTION AND STRENGTHENING TENURE SECURITY. WITH A FOCUS ON RURAL SYRIA, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THREE FORMS OF TENURIAL RESILIENCE WHICH ARE LIKELY TO PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN THE STABILIZATION AND RECOVERY OF THE COUNTRY, AND EXPLORES OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUPPORTING THESE.
643	THE STUDY INVESTIGATES THE SELF-ORGANIZATIONAL BASES OF DEMOCRACY. THE AUTHOR PROVES THAT SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY IS THE SELF-ORGANIZATIONAL BASIS OF DEMOCRACY. THE MAIN IDEA OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT THE SELF-ORGANIZATION OF DEMOCRACY HAS A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DIMENSION. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE SELF-ORGANIZATION BASES OF DEMOCRACY ARE SUCH STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY AS SOCIAL FEELINGS - VOLUNTARINESS, RESPONSIBILITY, OPENNESS, RESPECT, TOLERANCE, SOLIDARITY, HONESTY, HUMANNESS, TRUST, DEVOTION TO THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND SACRIFICE FOR THEM. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE ELEMENTS OF SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY ARE SUCH VALUES AS EGALITARIANISM, RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM, JUSTICE, THE PLURALITY OF VALUES, DEMOCRATIC COMPETITION, CIVIC PEACE AND COOPERATION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SOCIAL PHENOMENOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY IS THE BASIS FOR SUPPORT OF SUCH DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND PROCEDURES AS A DIVISION OF BRANCHES OF POWER, FAIR AND FREE ELECTIONS, THE SECRECY OF THE BALLOT, DELIBERATION, CONTROL OVER GOVERNMENT AND MULTIPARTY SYSTEM.
644	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS ON REGIONAL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT USING A PANEL DATA MODEL OF 11 EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES DURING 1996-2017. IT DIVIDES THE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS INTO SIX ECONOMIC FACTORS AND SIX LEGAL-POLITICAL FACTORS. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THE LEGAL-POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS HAVE A STRONGER IMPACT ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT THAN THE ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN EAST ASIA. IMPROVEMENT IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SUCH AS FISCAL FREEDOM, BUSINESS FREEDOM, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW CAN PROMOTE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IMPROVEMENTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF ENTERPRISES TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND IMPROVE THE STRENGTH OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THEREBY REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS AND MAKING THE FINANCIAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FAIRER AND MORE EFFICIENT. WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP BETTER. INSTITUTIONAL IMPACTS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES AND MYANMAR THAN IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA AND SINGAPORE.
645	THE PARADIGM OF NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM MEANT A QUALITATIVE CHANGE IN THE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING AND ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHT AND CONSEQUENTLY, AN EXPANSION OF THE JURISDICTIONAL FUNCTION OF CONTROL OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY. THIS HAS GENERATED SOME RISKS OF INTERFERENCE FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASES OF INTERPRETATION AND CONCRETION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEPTS FORMULATED WITH HIGH DEGREES OF INDETERMINACY, ON THE OCCASION OF THE RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS INVOLVING RIGHTS. THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO MAKE A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN ARGUMENTS OF THE ECUADORIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SENTENCES (10-18 CN AND 11-18 CN OF 2019) REFERRING TO EQUAL MARRIAGE, ACCORDING TO THE THEORY OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LIMITS OF THE CONTROL OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAWS, TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE CC HAS EXCEEDED ITS POWERS RELATED TO CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL AND BREAKS THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL BALANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
646	THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ORGANIZED CIVIL SOCIETY, WITH STRONG ACTION AND AUTONOMY IN RELATION TO THE STATE, ALLOWING THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ENVIRONMENT FAVORABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS). THE STUDY SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY WHICH ADAPTATIONS ALTERNATIVE OR HORIZONTAL ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO PROMOTE IN ORDER TO BE ADHERENT TO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK OF THE THIRD SECTOR (MROSC), AND BE ELIGIBLE TO TRANSACT WITH THE PUBLIC POWER. UNDER A QUALITATIVE, DEDUCTIVE AND SURVEY-BASED APPROACH, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT ISSUES THAT DO NOT START WITH THE DECISION OF THE CSO COMMUNITY HAMPER ITS WILLINGNESS AND PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ASPECTS THAT ADHERE TO THE MROSC, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RULES NEEDS TO EMANATE FROM THE COLLECTIVITY. IF THIS OCCURS FROM ANY EXTERNAL BODY, THE ORGANIZATION THAT ACCEPTS SUCH CONDITION WILL LOSE ONE OF ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH IS AUTONOMY.
647	DOES THE ART OF CRAFTING AND AMENDING A CONSTITUTION LEAD TO AN INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AMONG CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, AND IF SO, WHAT EFFECT DOES THAT HAVE ON COUNTRIES' DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE? DRAWING FROM THEORETICAL CLAIMS ON THE SEPARATION OF POWER AND ELECTORAL LEGITIMACY, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A CONCEPT THAT IDENTIFIES THE INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSISTENCY AND INCONSISTENCY IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE PRESIDENCY. EMPIRICALLY, THIS CONCEPT IS FOCUSED ON ALIGNING OR COUNTERBALANCING THE MODE OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE DE JURE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT. BASED ON A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE OF REPUBLICAN PARLIAMENTARY AND SEMI-PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EMPIRICAL TRENDS OF CONSISTENT AND INCONSISTENT DESIGN AND ADDRESSES THEIR EFFECT ON DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. THE FINDINGS SHOW A BALANCE BETWEEN CONSISTENT AND INCONSISTENT DESIGN IN TERMS OF QUANTITY. THE INFLUENCE ON DEMOCRATIZATION VARIES CONSIDERABLY ACROSS DIFFERENT MEASURES BUT I FIND SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR A POSITIVE EFFECT OF INCONSISTENCY ON LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
648	CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISONS OF CRIME ACROSS THE WORLD CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT HOMICIDE RATES ARE HIGHER IN MORE IMPOVERISHED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF FORMAL SOCIAL CONTROLS AS MEDIATORS BETWEEN SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND HOMICIDE HAS NEVER BEEN INVESTIGATED ACROSS A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. TO PROVIDE DATA ON THE EFFICIENCY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE WORLD, WE FOUND 1,223 EXPERTS AND HAD THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE, PROVIDING DATA FOR 145 COUNTRIES. RESULTS FROM STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS MODELS (AMOS) SHOW THAT ADVERSE SOCIAL CONDITIONS (COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND YOUTHFULNESS OF THE POPULATION) DOWNWARDLY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF FORMAL SOCIAL CONTROL (APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, LOW CORRUPTION RATE, EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND SATISFACTION WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES). LOW LEVELS OF FORMAL SOCIAL CONTROL LEAD TO HIGHER LEVELS OF HOMICIDE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE SOCIAL CONDITIONS ON HOMICIDE IS MEDIATED BY FORMAL SOCIAL CONTROL.
649	SCHOLARS HAVE LONG BEEN FASCINATED BY THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THEY START WITH A FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION: CAN INTERNATIONAL COURTS AFFECT HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW IS IMPLEMENTED? IN THIS REVIEW, WE LAY OUT FOUR OF THE MOST COMMON THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS FOR WHY INTERNATIONAL COURTS MATTER. WE THEN INTERROGATE THESE ACCOUNTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXAMINE THEIR VIEWS ON HOW MUCH INFLUENCE COURTS HAVE AND WHAT THE LIKELY WELFARE CONSEQUENCES ARE FOR THE SIGNATORIES OF AN AGREEMENT. IN SO DOING, WE IDENTIFY CRITICAL CONDITIONS THAT MUST OBTAIN FOR COURT INFLUENCE UNDER EACH OF THE ARGUMENTS. WE THEN BRING MORE RECENT SCHOLARSHIP TO BEAR ON THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THESE CONDITIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXAMINE WHAT RESEARCH ON THE STRUCTURE OF LAW, THE PREFERENCES OF JUDGES, AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IMPLIES ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS BASED ON THE FOUR FOUNDATIONAL ARGUMENTS. WE CONCLUDE WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
650	INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS PAY' COULD BE THE MANTRA OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE ON INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS: TYING THEIR HANDS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IS A MEANS FOR GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH THROUGH POLITICALLY COSTLY, BUT ULTIMATELY WELFARE-ENHANCING REFORMS. IT IS ARGUED IN THIS ARTICLE THAT THIS LOGIC HAS A LIMIT, WHICH CAN BE EMPIRICALLY OBSERVED. PAST A GIVEN POINT, FURTHER DEPTH OF INTEGRATION INCREASES ODDS OF BACKSLIDING. THIS BELIEF IS TESTED IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCESSION TO AN INSTITUTION WHOSE RULES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY SCRUTINISED: THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO). COUNTRIES WITH LOW RULE OF LAW ARE IMPOSED A RISK PREMIUM IN THE FORM OF DEMANDS FOR DEEPER CONCESSIONS, MAKING OVER-COMMITTING' POSSIBLE. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS USED TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEEPER COMMITMENTS LEAD TO BACKSLIDING. INDUSTRY-LEVEL ANALYSIS SUPPORTS THESE BELIEFS: DEEP COMMITMENTS LEAD TO INCREASED ODDS OF BACKTRACKING THROUGH A RANGE OF LEGAL AND EXTRA-LEGAL MECHANISMS. AMBITIOUS INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS CAN BACKFIRE.
651	THE NETWORK HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CHANNEL FOR CURRENT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, AND BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF UNIVERSITY LIFE. ALTHOUGH COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS VERY LIKE NETWORK BUT MOST COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS CANNOT USE THE NETWORK EFFECTIVELY. NETWORK WITH ITS OPENNESS AND VITALITY ALSO MAKES SOME COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FREELY, LACK OF MORAL SELF-DISCIPLINE IN THE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT. MORE AND MORE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAY ATTENTION TO THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT, BUT A FEW COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. SO, UNIVERSITIES NEED TO CARRY OUT EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW EDUCATION AND MORALITY EDUCATION FOR UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. COUNTRIES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE NETWORK LEGISLATION; REGULATE THE CONSTRAINTS ON THE NETWORK INFRINGEMENT AND CYBER CRIME. AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD PURIFY NETWORK ENVIRONMENT THROUGH TECHNICAL MEANS AND HELP COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS GROW UP HEALTHILY IN THE NETWORK ENVIRONMENT.
652	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE HOW INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT TREATIES INTERACT WITH THE TRANSITION FROM ARMED CONFLICT TO PEACE. WHILE THE PROTECTION OF FOREIGN INVESTORS IN CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENTS IS A NECESSARY REQUIREMENT FOR RE-ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AND ATTRACTING NEW CAPITAL THAT IS NEEDED FOR REBUILDING THE WRECKED ECONOMY, THE THREAT OF EXCESSIVE ARBITRATION CLAIMS MAY ALSO COMPLICATE THE DELICATE PROCESS OF CREATING A STABLE POLITICAL ORDER. THE ARTICLE COMPARES TRADITIONAL, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT METHODS OF SETTLING POST-CONFLICT INTERNATIONAL CLAIMS WITH INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION. UNLIKE INVESTORS, GOVERNMENTS WILL USUALLY BASE THEIR DECISION ABOUT RAISING A CONFLICT-RELATED CLAIM ON A NUMBER OF EXTRA-LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS, SUCH AS CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE PEACE. THESE CONSIDERATIONS WILL OFTEN REFLECT IN THE AMOUNT AND THE METHOD OF PAYMENT OF POST-CONFLICT COMPENSATION. THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE INVESTMENT ARBITRATION PRACTICE AND IDENTIFIES CERTAIN INTERPRETIVE TOOLS THAT TAKE BETTER ACCOUNT OF POST-CONFLICT REALITIES AND LEAD TO MORE BALANCED AWARDS.
653	AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II, F. A. HAYEK DENOUNCED THE THEN-POPULAR IDEA OF CENTRAL PLANNING BY ARGUING THAT, IF PURSUED TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION, IT WOULD ENTAIL TOTALITARIANISM. BUT THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO PROBLEMS. FIRST, JUDGING BY HIS EXAMPLE OF NAZI GERMANY, STATE CONTROL OVER THE ECONOMY APPEARS TO BE A CONSEQUENCE, NOT A CAUSE, OF THE MONOPOLIZATION OF POLITICAL POWER. SECOND, HE CONFLATED SOCIALISM AND MERE INTERFERENCE IN THE MARKET WITH CENTRAL PLANNING. THEREFORE, HISTORY DID NOT SO MUCH FALSIFY HAYEK'S PREDICTION AS BYPASS IT: ONCE THE VOGUE FOR CENTRAL PLANNING FADED IN THE WEST, HAYEK'S BOOK BECAME IRRELEVANTEXCEPT, IRONICALLY, IN GERMANY. THERE, IT WAS READ AS A MANIFESTO FOR GOOD PLANNING THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW. ALONGSIDE OTHER NEOLIBERAL WRITERS, HAYEK HAD A PROFOUND (IF LITTLE ACKNOWLEDGED) INFLUENCE ON THE SHAPE OF THE EMERGING FEDERAL REPUBLIC AND, THROUGH IT, ON THE WHOLE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.
654	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE TRANSITION FROM REVOLUTIONS TO CONSTITUTIONS IN EGYPT. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT TRANSITION, THE ARTICLE COMPARES EVENTS SINCE 2011 TO THE 1919 CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION AND THE 1952 FREE OFFICERS' MOVEMENT. IN COMPARING THESE THREE REVOLUTIONARY PERIODS AND THE CONSTITUTIONS THEY PRODUCED, THE ARTICLE MAKES TWO OVERARCHING CLAIMS: FIRST, A CONSTITUTION DOES NOT ARISE FROM THE FIAT OF WISE LAWGIVERS OR EXPERTS IN THE RULE OF LAW. RATHER, IT EMERGES FROM A CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL PROCESS IN WHICH COMPETING AGENTS AND INSTITUTIONS SEEK TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN INTERESTS. THIS COMPETITIVE PROCESS, HOWEVER, IS ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO CONSTITUTION-MAKING, CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS AND POLITICAL LIFE MORE WIDELY. SECOND, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THAT WHILE THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING IN EGYPT REVEAL DOMESTIC POLITICS, THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING ALSO DEMONSTRATES HOW SUCH DYNAMICS TAKE PLACE IN A GLOBAL POLITICAL CONTEXT. TOGETHER, THESE TWO CLAIMS POINT UP THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM IS JUST AS MUCH A POLITICAL MOVEMENT AS A LEGAL DOCTRINE.
655	THIS PAPER IS AN INVESTIGATION INTO AND A CRITIQUE OF THE IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION OF EAST ASIAN LEGAL TRADITION AS A 'LACK' IN THE JAPANESE COLONIAL PROJECT IN TAIWAN. ECHOING TEEMU RUSKOLA'S AND LAURA NADER'S CRITIQUES OF LEGAL ORIENTALISM BUT IN A SETTING THAT TRANSCENDS THE WEST/NON-WEST DIVISION, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE COLONISED PEOPLE'S SENSE OF LEGAL INFERIORITY- HOW THEY INTERNALISED ORIENTALISM WHILE CLAIMING LOCAL SUBJECTIVITYTHROUGH A FEMINIST LENS, DEMONSTRATING THE GENDER DIMENSION OF LEGAL ORIENTALISM. THE DISCUSSION BEGINS WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THE COLONISED PEOPLE'S 'LAGGING BEHIND' IN THE CIVILISING PROCESS AND THEIR 'LACK' OF RULE OF LAW IN COLONIAL EYES, FOLLOWED BY AN EXPLORATION OF THE 'LAG' AND 'LACK' DISCOURSES BOTH IN THE DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE APPLIED ITS CIVIL CODE IN THE COLONY OF TAIWAN AND IN TEXTS ON COLONIAL WOMEN'S LIBERATION, AND CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON HOW THE PERCEPTION OF 'LACK AS TRADITION' INFORMS THE NARRATIVES OF ORIENTALIST LEGAL HISTORY.
656	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE UNWIELDY STATE OF UK ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION IN 2013, AFTER 25 YEARS OF INNOVATION, AD HOC REFORM AND POLITICAL CHANGE. IT SHOWS THAT AN APPRAISAL OF UK ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION INVOLVES CONSIDERING MUCH MORE THAN PRIMARY LEGISLATION EMANATING FROM WESTMINSTER-SECONDARY LEGISLATION, DEVOLVED LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS, POLICY DOCUMENTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE NORMS ALL SERVE TO CONSTITUTE AND INFORM THE LEGISLATIVE PICTURE. THROUGH THIS WIDE ANALYTICAL LENS, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT CHARACTERISE UK ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION TODAY, FROM UNDERMINING OF THE RULE OF LAW DUE TO ITS INACCESSIBLE COMPLEXITY, TO OCCUPYING AN AWKWARD PLACE IN PUBLIC LAW TERMS. A PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS THE FRAGMENTATION OF LEGISLATION, AND THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CASE FOR INTEGRATING ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT UNDERMINE THE FLEXIBILITY AND INSTITUTIONAL EXPERTISE THAT MORE FOCUSED LEGISLATION ALLOWS. THE ARTICLE OFFERS NOT ONLY A METHOD FOR ANALYSING THE CURRENT UK ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATIVE LANDSCAPE, BUT SUGGESTS ROUTES FOR REFORM THAT MIGHT NOW BE CONSIDERED.
657	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION OF MAJOR CIVIL UPHEAVAL AND VIOLENT POLITICAL TURMOIL - HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS "ACTIVE POLITICAL FACTIONALISM" - THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE MEXICAN STATE OF OAXACA. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS WORK IDENTIFIES THE MAIN CAUSES OF EXTRA-INSTITUTIONAL PROTEST POLITICS OR UNCIVIL MODES OF POLITICAL ACTION THAT SERIOUSLY AFFECT POLITICAL STABILITY AND UNDERMINE DEMOCRATIC ADVANCEMENT. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTS OF TWO GROUPS OF EXPLANATORY FACTORS: I) DETERIORATED SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS (SUCH AS POVERTY AND INEQUALITY), AND II) INSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS (CORRUPTION, ELECTORAL EXCLUSION, A WEAK RULE OF LAW, AMONG OTHERS) IN A CONTEXT OF "SUBNATIONAL AUTHORITARIANISM." THE STUDY ALSO EXAMINES SOME OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH THESE VARIABLES OPERATE AND INTERACT WITH OTHER FACTORS (RESOURCES, OPPORTUNITIES, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, ETC.) TO GENERATE POLITICAL FACTIONALISM. THIS WORK FINALLY ASSESSES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE TWO GROUPS OF EXPLANATORY FACTORS. EVIDENCE PRESENTED HERE SHOWS THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF POLITICAL FACTIONALISM IN OAXACA, WHILE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT PREDOMINANT.
658	CHINA IS MOVING TOWARDS GREATER RULE OF LAW AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING CIVIL SOCIETY PARTICIPATION. CHINA'S AIDS RESPONSE HAS MOVED FROM DENIAL TO PRAGMATIC POLICY. THIS CHANGE HAS COME BOTH THROUGH GLOBAL INFLUENCE AND DOMESTIC PRESSURE AND LED TO ADOPTION OF MANY INTERNATIONAL NORMS FOR PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND CARE, SOMETIMES IN CONFLICT WITH CULTURAL ATTITUDES AND POLITICAL POSITIONS. CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CHINA'S AIDS NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) AND TRANSNATIONAL CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO TRANSFER OF NEW NORMS AND APPROACHES. POLICIES ON SEX WORKER RIGHTS, NGOS' ROLE IN GOVERNANCE, LEGAL PROTECTION FROM DISCRIMINATION, COMPENSATION FOR SOME INFECTED BY MEDICAL PROCEDURES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR ESSENTIAL MEDICINES HAVE BEGUN TO CHANGE. ADVOCACY AND EXPERT INPUT FROM DOMESTIC NGOS CONNECTED TO GLOBAL GROUPS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THESE SOFT POWER PROCESSES ACCOMPANYING GLOBALIZATION ARE CREATING INROADS EVEN IN CHINA REGARDING UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND PROTECTION OF CITIZEN'S INTERESTS.
659	WE EXAMINE SOURCES OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT OF FOREIGN FIRMS THAT CROSS-LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES AS AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (ADRS) BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005. WE ANALYZE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER AND DISPERSION OF ANALYST RECOMMENDATIONS ON FOREIGN FIRMS FOLLOWING THEIR CROSS-LISTING. WE FIND INCREASES IN ANALYST COVERAGE INTENSITY ACROSS ALL FOUR TYPES OF ADR PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY AMONG FIRMS THAT WERE LISTED ON ORGANIZED EXCHANGES (THE LISTING EFFECT), AND THOSE THAT ADOPTED CAPITAL RAISING ADR PROGRAMS (THE FINANCING EFFECT). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LISTING EFFECT IS MORE PERSISTENT THAN THE FINANCING EFFECT. ON THE OTHER HAND, REDUCTIONS IN RECOMMENDATION DISPERSION ARE OBSERVED MAINLY FOR FIRMS THAT CHOOSE NON-CAPITAL RAISING ADRS AND THOSE FROM EMERGING MARKETS. OVERALL, IMPROVEMENTS IN INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT ARE MORE PROFOUND AMONG FOREIGN FIRMS ORIGINATING FROM COUNTRIES WITH GREATER INFORMATION ASYMMETRY, NAMELY, COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER LEGAL TRADITION AND RULE OF LAW, AND COUNTRIES THAT ARE LESS FAMILIAR TO U.S. INVESTORS.

660	PAKISTAN HAD NO WORTHWHILE CIVIL SOCIETY AND HARDLY ANY MIDDLE CLASS IN 1947 DUE TO RAMPANT ILLITERACY AND ABSENCE OF AN INDEPENDENT MEDIA. THE MASSES WERE POOR, THE COUNTRY WAS DESCRIBED AN "ECONOMIC DESERT" AND THERE WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED INFLUX OF REFUGEES. THE COUNTRY LACKED THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AND INSTITUTIONS. THE CAPABILITY TO DEVELOP THEM WAS LACKING. THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREATS TO THE SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY TURNED IT INTO A SECURITY STATE. WEAK POLITICAL LEADERSHIP CREATED SPACE FOR CIVIL-MILITARY BUREAUCRACY. THIS LED TO THE CUT-OFF PERIODS IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, WHICH WAS DERAILED THRICE IN 1958, 1977 AND 1999. AT PRESENT, THE COUNTRY IS PARTIALLY DEVELOPED, THE MIDDLE CLASS IS GROWING AND CIVIL SOCIETY IS ASSERTIVE; A VIBRANT MEDIA HAS COME UP, AND MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IS LITERATE. THERE IS AN OVERALL URGE FOR PEACE. THE PEOPLE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR PREFERENCE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO HAVE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE.
661	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE TWO AUTHORS EXAMINE THE LEAP FROM BUSINESS MANAGEMENT TO CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF STAKEHOLDER THEORY. BECAUSE STAKEHOLDER THEORY WAS DEVELOPED FOR BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, THEY PROVIDE A THOROUGH ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGINAL FRAMEWORK. FURTHERMORE, TO ILLUSTRATE THE THEORY'S APPLICATION AS A RECENTLY ADOPTED PARAMETER FOR THE UNITED NATIONS, THEY USE FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL KOFI ATTA ANNAN'S 2004-REPORT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL, "THE RULE OF LAW AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES". PROCEEDING ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT WHILE ALL PREMISES ULTIMATELY MATCH TRADITIONAL POSITIONS IN GENERAL JURISPRUDENCE, IT APPEARS THAT STAKEHOLDER THEORY NEVERTHELESS FORCES THE UNITED NATIONS TO TAKE SIDES IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MANNER, ESPECIALLY PERTAINING TO RIGHTS-TYPOLOGY AND THE CREDENTIALS-CHECKING FOR THIS. FINALLY, SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS ARE DISTILLED AS PART OF AN ATTEMPT TO FORMULATE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR UNITED NATIONS JUSTICE MANAGERS AND ADMINISTRATORS.
662	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES COMPETING NOTIONS OF EQUALITY IN ARISTOTLE'S THEORY OF JUSTICE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MONEY FOR COMPARING UNEQUALS. WHILE POLITICAL JUSTICE REQUIRES AN "ARITHMETICAL" EQUALITY IN WHICH EQUAL PERSONS RECEIVE EQUAL SHARES, ARISTOTLE SUGGESTS THAT PERSONS ARE ACTUALLY UNEQUAL; NATURAL JUSTICE DEMANDS A "GEOMETRICAL" FORM OF EQUALITY IN WHICH UNEQUAL PERSONS RECEIVE UNEQUAL SHARES. A RESOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA CAN BE FOUND IN ARISTOTLE'S DISCUSSION OF RECIPROCITY IN WHICH HE DEMONSTRATES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MONEY IN EXCHANGE. MONEY, PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY, MAKES COMMENSURABLE PERSONS AND SKILLS WHERE NO COMMENSURABILITY IS APPARENT. AS A COMMENSURATING "MIDDLE TERM" BETWEEN UNEQUAL PERSONS AND THEIR PRODUCTS, MONEY IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF JUSTICE. IT PROVIDES AN ARTIFICIAL EQUALITY THAT CAN ALLOW POLITICAL JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW TO COME INTO BEING. THE CORE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARISTOTLE'S THEORY OF JUSTICE AND THOSE OF MODERN THEORISTS JOHN RAWLS AND ROBERT NOZICK ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.
663	INDONESIA'S ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMISSION AND ANTI-CORRUPTION COURT HAVE A CONVICTION RATE OF 100% IN THE 100 OR SO CASES PROCESSED THUS FAR. SOME OF THOSE CONVICTED FOR CORRUPTION HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF INDONESIA'S ANTI-CORRUPTION FRAMEWORK IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF ONE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISION, WHICH REMOVED SOME FLEXIBILITY FROM THE DEFINITION OF CORRUPTION UNDER THE CORRUPTION ERADICATION LAW. THAT FLEXIBILITY HAD ALLOWED DEFENDANTS TO BE CONVICTED FOR CORRUPTION IF THEY HAD CAUSED LOSS TO THE STATE AND ENRICHED ANOTHER PARTY AND, IN SO DOING, HAD BREACHED 'COMMUNITY STANDARDS'. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECIDED THAT 'COMMUNITY STANDARDS' WAS TOO VAGUE AND UNCERTAIN A NOTION TO GROUND A CONVICTION FOR CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS, DELIBERATELY AND EXPLICITLY, CIRCUMVENTED THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S DECISION. THAT MAY HAVE STRENGTHENED INDONESIA'S ANTI-CORRUPTION DRIVE, BUT IT HAS DONE SO AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
664	WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OPENNESS AND PER-CAPITA INCOME USING CROSS-COUNTRY DATA FROM 126 COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT TRADE LEADS TO A HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING IN FLEXIBLE ECONOMIES, BUT NOT IN RIGID ECONOMIES. BUSINESS REGULATION, ESPECIALLY ON FIRM ENTRY, IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, HIGHER EDUCATION, OR RULE OF LAW AS A COMPLEMENTARY POLICY TO TRADE LIBERALIZATION. SPECIFICALLY, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE STANDARD DETERMINANTS OF PER-CAPITA INCOME, OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT A 1%, INCREASE IN TRADE IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE THAN A ONE-HALF PERCENT RISE IN PER-CAPITA INCOME IN ECONOMIES THAT FACILITATE FIRM ENTRY, BUT HAS NO POSITIVE INCOME EFFECTS IN MORE RIGID ECONOMIES. THE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SCHUMPETERIAN "CREATIVE DESTRUCTION", WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF NEW BUSINESS ENTRY IN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, AND WITH PREVIOUS FIRM-LEVEL STUDIES SHOWING THAT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION COME LARGELY FROM AN INTRA-SECTORAL REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES.

665	THIS ARTICLE IS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COUNTRY CAN BREAK FREE FROM THE SHADOW OF FORMER PRESIDENT RENE AND HIS ONE-PARTY STATE. THE PAPER EXAMINES EIGHT KEY AREAS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE: THE CONSTITUTION AND RULE OF LAW; THE JUDICIARY; THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY; ELECTIONS; CIVIL SOCIETY; THE INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES; ECONOMIC LIFE; AND THE EXECUTIVE. ALTHOUGH IT FINDS SOME CHANGES FOR THE BETTER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, OLD HABITS REMAIN OF A POLITICISED JUDICIARY, A BLURRING OF THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PARTY AND STATE, REGIME POLICING, PARTISAN DISTRIBUTION OF STATE BENEFITS AND A CONSTRAINED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. IT CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE LIKELY ROLE OF THE FORMER INCUMBENT, GIVEN THAT HE STILL RETAINS THE CHAIR OF THE RULING PARTY AND SHOWS LITTLE SIGN OF ALLOWING THE NEW PRESIDENT TO BE HIS OWN MAN. THE LIKELIHOOD OF FURTHER GOVERNANCE PROGRESS FOR SEYCHELLES DEPENDS ON THE POLITICAL COURAGE OF PRESIDENT MICHEL.
666	VIRTUALLY NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES RAISED OBJECTIONS TO THE 1964 MILITARY TAKEOVER OF THE BRAZILIAN CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT. IN THE EARLY 1970S, HOWEVER, THE BRAZILIAN REGIME HAD BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH TORTURE AND THE ARBITRARY RULE OF LAW. BY THE END OF THAT DECADE, COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS HAD DEVELOPED INTO A YARDSTICK FOR MEASURING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES IN LATIN AMERICA. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT BETWEEN 1969 AND 1974, A SMALL GROUP OF DEDICATED CHURCH ACTIVISTS, EXILED BRAZILIANS, AND ACADEMICS INTRODUCED THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN LATIN AMERICA INTO THE U.S. NATIONAL BODY POLITIC. A NETWORK OF CONCERNED ACTIVISTS FASHIONED A SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE JOURNALISTS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE ABUSES TAKING PLACE UNDER THE GENERALS' RULE. THEIR ACTIVITIES HELPED ISOLATE THE MILITARY REGIME AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR A BROADER SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT WITH LATIN AMERICAN POPULAR STRUGGLES IN THE LATE 1970S AND 1980S.
667	THE FORMER COMMUNIST SOCIETIES OF EASTERN CENTRAL EUROPE (E.G. POLAND) REPEATEDLY EXPERIENCE BARRIERS AND BLOCKADES ON THE ROAD TOWARD AN OPEN, DEMOCRATIC, MARKET SOCIETY OF THE WESTERN TYPE. THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT MOST OF THE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO THE DEFICIENCY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES, THE CENTRAL OF WHICH IS TRUST. A THEORY OF TRUST IS PROPOSED, INFORMED BY THE AUTHOR'S EARLIER WORK ON 'SOCIAL BECOMING'. THE 'CULTURE OF DISTRUST' IS FOUND TO PERVADE POLISH SOCIETY AT ALL LEVELS OF SOCIAL LIFE. PART OF THAT SYNDROME DERIVES FROM THE LEGACY OF REAL SOCIALISM, BUT MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON CURRENT CONDITIONS: THE NEW 'RISK ENVIRONMENTS', WIDESPREAD ANOMIE, INEFFICIENCY OF POLITICAL ELITES, AND AN ENHANCED FEELING OF RELATIVE DEPRIVATION AFTER REVOLUTIONARY ELATION AND UNREALISTIC HOPES. TO RESTORE TRUST, AN INDISPENSABLE COMPONENT OF ROBUST SOCIAL TISSUE, THE CONSISTENCY OF REFORMS MUST BE SAFEGUARDED, THE RULE OF LAW METICULOUSLY OBSERVED, INTEGRATION WITH WESTERN DEMOCRACIES SPEEDED UP AND TRUST ITSELF TURNED INTO A RECOGNIZED SOCIAL VALUE.
668	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS COMMONLY CONSIDERED TO BE A REGULATORY GREAT POWER THAT PROJECTS EXTERNAL INFLUENCE BASED ON THE POWER VESTED IN ITS INTERNAL MARKET. RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN, HOWEVER, ABOUT WHY AND WHEN THE EU MOBILISES ITS MARKET POWER TO PUT DIRECT PRESSURE ON NON-COOPERATIVE COUNTRIES IN REGULATORY MATTERS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES A CRITICAL CASE OF SUCH POWER PROJECTION: THE 'BLACKLISTING' OF THIRD COUNTRIES. TESTING EXPECTATIONS DRAWN FROM SOME OF THE MAIN THEORIES OF EU POWER, IT FINDS THAT ELITE ACTION TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW BEST EXPLAINS WHY THE EU USES BLACKLISTING, WHEREAS BOTTOM-UP STAKEHOLDER PRESSURE EXPLAINS WHEN THIS TECHNIQUE IS USED. A COMBINATION OF THE THEORIES CAN THEREFORE EXPLAIN THE PUZZLING PATTERN OF WHERE BLACKLISTING SCHEMES WERE SET UP WITH REFERENCE TO EU NORMS AND PEGGED TO INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT EVENTUALLY APPLIED QUASI-EXCLUSIVELY TO TINY THIRD COUNTRIES. THESE FINDINGS CALL FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON EU MARKET POWER.
669	THE VANISHING CRITIQUE OF CAPITALISM WITHIN THE SEWOL MOVEMENT FOR TRUTH FINDING HAS REVEALED THE BARE FACE OF THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC ORDER AND ITS RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE SEWOL MOVEMENT AS THE BELLWETHER, IN A SYNCHRONIC SENSE, OF THE CANDLELIGHT PROTESTS THAT HAVE BECOME A MODALITY OF DIRECT ACTION IN SOUTH KOREA. I SEEK TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIFE POLITICS THAT HAS BECOME A KEY MARKER OF STRUGGLES AGAINST THE STATE-CAPITAL NETWORK SINCE THE 2000S. I ASCRIBE THE ANTINOMIES OF TRUTH FINDING AND MOURNING AND OF MASSACRE AND ACCIDENT IN THE SEWOL MOVEMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS THAT REGARDS THE 1987 MOMENT IN SOUTH KOREA AS AN IRREVOCABLE RUPTURE FROM DICTATORSHIP TO DEMOCRACY. THE SEWOL MOVEMENT ILLUMINATES HOW THE AXES OF ORGANIZATION AND SPONTANEITY AND OF REFORMISM AND REVOLUTION IN THE CANDLELIGHT PROTEST MOVEMENT ARE NOT SO MUCH BINARIES, OR OPPOSITIONS, AS HIEROGLYPHIC SIGNS OF THE DEMOCRATIC UNCONSCIOUS AND ITS EXCESSES THAT CONTEST THE TEMPORALIZATIONS OF THE CAPITALIST PRESENT.
670	DOES POLITICAL MISTRUST LEAD TO INSTITUTIONAL DISENGAGEMENT? MUCH WORK IN POLITICAL SCIENCE HOLDS THAT TRUST MATTERS FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, INCLUDING RECOURSE TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. SCHOLARS OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, RELYING LARGELY ON SURVEY RESEARCH, ARGUE THAT LOW TRUST DECREASES LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND COOPERATION, THREATENING THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND MOBILIZATION SCHOLARS, MEANWHILE, SUGGEST THAT TRUST DOES NOT DRIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM ENGAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THEIR SINGLE-CASE STUDY APPROACH MAKES ASSESSING THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR FINDINGS DIFFICULT. BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE COMPARATIVE FOCUS-GROUP STUDY IN TWO UNEVEN DEMOCRATIC STATES, CHILE AND COLOMBIA, WE SHOW THAT TRUST IS NOT THE PRIMARY FACTOR DRIVING JUSTICE SYSTEM ENGAGEMENT. RATHER, PEOPLE'S ENGAGEMENT DECISIONS ARE SHAPED BY THEIR EXPECTATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS FOR THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM AND BY THEIR POLITICALLY CONSTRUCTED CAPACITIES FOR LEGAL AGENCY. OUR STUDY OFFERS INSIGHTS OF RELEVANCE FOR ANALYSTS OF VARIOUS FORMS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN UNEVEN DEMOCRATIC STATES ACROSS THE GLOBE.
671	TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION (TE) COMPRISES TWO PRIMARY LEVELS: PERSONAL CHANGE AND ACTION. IT IS A PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING THE STRUCTURES OF INJUSTICE AND RECOGNIZING ONE'S CAPACITY TO RECTIFY THOSE ROOTS OF INJUSTICE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION (TE) IN MODERN RUSSIA'S EDUCATION SYSTEM. A DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL METHOD IS USED TO MEET THE AIM OF THE STUDY. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT, IN THEIR OPINION, HINDER THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RULE- OF-LAW STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE COUNTRY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF RUSSIA. THESE INCLUDE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ISSUES, THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY, PROPER EDUCATION, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, AND THE FORMATION OF ONE'S OWN DEVELOPMENT IDEOLOGY. SPEAKING ABOUT THE ONGOING INTERNAL PROCESSES IN RUSSIA, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RUSSIA'S GREAT WEAKNESS IS THE LACK OF A TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION AND FORWARD-LOOKING IDEOLOGY.
672	LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES HAVE DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS TO EMPOWER CITIZENS AGAINST THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE BRINGS ATTENTION TO AN OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT KEY, ACTOR IN THESE PROCESSES: THE LEGAL COMPLEX. I ARGUE THAT THE CONTENT OF REFORMS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW PARTIALLY REFLECTS THE INTERESTS OF POLITICALLY INFLUENTIAL COLLECTIVE LEGAL ACTORS. POLITICAL INFLUENCE IS DEFINED AS A FUNCTION OF ALLIANCES WITH CIVIL SOCIETY AND EMBEDDEDNESS WITHIN DECISION-MAKING ARENAS OF THE STATE. TO DEVELOP THIS ARGUMENT, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE SLOW BUILDING OF BRAZIL'S PUBLIC DEFENDERS' OFFICE (PDO). I ARGUE THAT THE OFFICE'S INITIAL INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS RESULTED FROM DEFENDERS' FRAGILE POLITICAL POSITION RELATIVE TO THAT OF PROSECUTORS AND THE BAR DURING BRAZIL'S CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITION. ITS EVENTUAL STRENGTHENING SIXTEEN YEARS LATER RESULTED FROM CHANGES TO THE LEGAL COMPLEX ALLIANCE IN ITS FAVOUR, THE FORMATION OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DEFENDERS AND CIVIL SOCIETY, AND INCREASED PDO ACCESS TO POLICYMAKING SPACES.
673	THE STATUS OF INDIA AS THE WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY IS OFTEN LAUDED, BUT THE RE-ELECTION OF THE OVERTLY HINDU NATIONALIST BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY IN 2019 HAS INCREASED CONCERNS ABOUT THE THREAT TO INDIA'S MULTINATIONAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. INDIA IS NOT THE ONLY DEMOCRACY FACING CHALLENGES RELATED TO MAJORITARIAN NATIONALISM; THERE HAS BEEN A WORLDWIDE RISE IN THE LANGUAGE OF MAJORITY 'RIGHTS' IN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. THE IMPORTANCE OF ANALYSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RIGHTS OF MAJORITIES ARE BEING INCREASINGLY INSTITUTIONALIZED WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS HAS THEREFORE INCREASED. IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY WHETHER TENDENCIES TOWARD ETHNIC DEMOCRACY ARE INCREASING (AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY DO SO). THERE MAY WELL BE RED FLAGS THAT EMERGE IN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS, HERALDING THE POTENTIAL DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A METHODOLOGY TO IDENTIFY DEGREES OF ETHNIC DEMOCRACY USING A COMBINATION OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL MEASURES AND ILLUSTRATES IT BY ASSESSING INDIA THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF ANTI-MUSLIM POLICIES AND RHETORIC.
674	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF UNFAIRNESS AND THEIR TENDENCIES TO THINK, FEEL, AND ACT IN RADICALIZING WAYS. VARIOUS THEORIES OF RADICALIZATION PROCESSES ARE REVIEWED THAT EXAMINE KEY ASPECTS OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS. THE REVIEW SHOWS THAT EXPERIENCED GROUP DEPRIVATION AND PERCEIVED IMMORALITY ARE AMONG THE CORE JUDGMENTS THAT CAN DRIVE MUSLIM RADICALIZATION, RIGHT-WING RADICALIZATION, AND LEFT-WING RADICALIZATION. SYMBOLS OF INJUSTICE, THE LEGITIMIZATION OF REVOLUTIONARY THOUGHT, AND THE EXPERIENCE OF UNFAIR TREATMENT CAN ALSO INCREASE RADICALIZATION. THE REVIEW ALSO EXAMINES CORE MODERATORS (E.G., UNCERTAINTY AND INSUFFICIENT SELF-CORRECTION) AND MEDIATORS (E.G., EXTERNALLY ORIENTED EMOTIONS) OF THE LINKAGE BETWEEN PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS AND CORE COMPONENTS OF RADICALIZATION (E.G., RIGIDITY OF THOUGHTS, HOT-COGNITIVE DEFENSE OF CULTURAL WORLDVIEWS, AND VIOLENT REJECTION OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE RULE OF LAW). THE REVIEW DISCUSSES HOW THE STUDY OF UNFAIRNESS AND RADICALIZATION CONTRIBUTES TO A ROBUST AND MEANINGFUL SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY.
675	FROM 1962 TO 1993, JORNAL DO BRASIL PUBLISHED "COLUNA DO CASTELLO", SIGNED BY JOURNALIST CARLOS CASTELLO BRANCO, ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS REFERENCES OF POLITICAL JOURNALISM IN THE COUNTRY. IT WAS READ BY INTELLECTUALS, POLITICIANS AND THE MILITARY, AS WELL AS INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENTS. IN THIS ARTICLE I ANALYZE HOW THE JOURNALIST PARTICIPATED IN THE DEBATE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE FIRST YEARS AFTER THE AI-5, FROM 1969 TO 1973. FROM THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN LAW, POLITICS AND HISTORY, THE JOURNALIST FOUND WAYS TO PUBLICIZE VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS IN THE DICTATORSHIP. AS AN INTELLECTUAL MEDIATOR, CASTELLO WAS ENGAGED IN SPREADING THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOUGHT TO MAKE INTELLIGIBLE THE POLITICAL-LEGAL PRINCIPLES THAT GUARANTEE HUMAN RIGHTS. FROM THE COMMON CHALLENGE OF RESISTANCE TO DICTATORSHIP THROUGH THE CIRCULATION OF REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE PRESS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE THE EXISTENCE OF RELATIONS OF SOLIDARITY AND DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIBERAL JOURNALISTS AND LEFT-WING MILITANTS.
676	THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLAIN THE DETERMINANTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL-EAST AND SOUTHEAST EUROPE AND THE FORMER USSR, WHICH CONSTITUTED QUITE A HOMOGENEOUS GROUP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD. THE PAPER CONCENTRATES ON THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS IN 24 POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES IN THE PERIOD 1989-2014, USING FOUR GROUPS OF INDICES: THE FREEDOM HOUSE'S POLITICAL FREEDOM MEASURE, THE INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM BY THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, THE WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AND THE TRANSITION INDICATORS PUBLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MAIN DRIVERS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TRANSITION COUNTRIES INCLUDED THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL PROXIMITY OF THESE COUNTRIES TO WESTERN EUROPE AND THE APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS (EU, NATO, WTO), WHICH ESTABLISHED CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET ECONOMY.
677	TODAY A GROWING NUMBER OF DECISIONS AFFECTING HUMAN LIBERTIES ARE TAKEN BY ALGORITHMS. THIS EVIDENCE RAISES A VAST NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE TRANSPARENCY OF SUCH TOOLS, THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ALGORITHMIC DECISION-MAKING AND THE SOCIETAL AND COGNITIVE IMPACTS OF SUCH ALGORITHMIC AUTOMATION. STARTING FROM WIENER'S FASCINATING INVENTION OF "CYBERNETICS", WHICH DEMOSTRATED THE ORIGINAL LINK BETWEEN THIS NEW SCIENCE AND THE VERY IDEA OF "PUBLIC GOVERNMENT", THIS PAPER MAPS THE INHERENT TENSION BETWEEN AI AND LAW. IT FOCUSES FIRSTLY ON THE IMPACT OF "CYBERNETIC REVOLUTION" ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, CONSIDERING THE TECHNOLOGICAL SWITCH FROM "MEANS" TO "SUBJECT" AND THEN ANALYSES SOME CASES INVOLVING THE USE OF PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS IN THE FIELDS OF CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE PAPER THEN EXAMINES AND CRITICIZES THE STANDARDS SET BY GDPR TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION FOR FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES. IT CONCLUDES BY CALLING FOR A NEW DOCTRINE OF "PRECAUTIONARY CONSTITUTIONALISM" THROUGH WHICH PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE GRANTED WITHIN DESIGNING NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
678	IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CENTRALIZED JUDICIAL REVIEW SYSTEM, THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE FRENCH CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL FULFILL A CRUCIAL ROLE AND EMBODY VERITABLE MILESTONES IN THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS MUCH IS UNCONTESTED AND, IN THE LIGHT OF THE EVOLUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION IN BOTH COUNTRIES, IS NOT CONTESTABLE. SUCH A PREMISE COULD EASILY SUGGEST THAT CYBER LAW HAS BECOME A CRUCIAL FIELD FOR ITALIAN AND FRENCH CONSTITUTIONAL CASE LAW, SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET'S INFLUENCE OVER ALMOST EVERY AREA OF LAW. BOTH THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE FRENCH CONSTITUTIONAL COUNCIL ( THE LATTER AT LEAST SINCE 2010) ARE ENDOWED WITH COMPETENCES THAT ALLOW THEM - AT LEAST IN THEORY - TO PERFORM AN EFFICIENT PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS RELEVANT TO THE INTERNET FRAMEWORK. DESPITE THE FEW JUDGMENTS CONCERNING THE INTERNET, THIS PAPER AIM TO ANALYZE CONSTITUTIONAL CASE LAW IN ORDER TO CONFIRM THIS HYPOTHESIS OR TO REFUTE IT.
679	THIS PAPER FIRST BRIEFLY EXAMINES THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA DECISIONS OF 2013 (ON COMPREHENSIVELY DEEPENING REFORM) AND 2014 (ON COMPREHENSIVELY MOVING FORWARD RULING THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW) WERE LAUNCHED. IT THEN ASSESSES THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE TWO DECISIONS. IT IS ARGUED THAT ALTHOUGH THE DECISIONS ARE SHORT OF INSPIRATION AND EXPECTATIONS FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS, THESE DECISIONS EFFECTIVELY RE-LAUNCHED LEGAL REFORMS IN CHINA, AND THAT MEASURES CONTAINED THEREIN ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR IMPROVING THE ACTUAL OPERATION OF THE LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. IT IS HOWEVER ALSO ARGUED THAT THE STRONG EMPHASIS ON PARTY LEADERSHIP, STRICT REQUIREMENTS ON IDEOLOGICAL CONTROL, TIGHT CONTROL OVER POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, OVER THE PRESS AND SOCIAL MEDIA, RELIGIOUS GROUPS AND MINORITY ACTIVISTS, POLITICAL DISSIDENTS, PUBLIC INTEREST LAWYERS ETC., AND THE IRRATIONAL REJECTION OF SUCH NOTIONS AS CONSTITUTIONALISM, CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE WILL SERIOUSLY SET BACK CHINA'S EFFORTS TOWARDS A GENUINE RULE OF LAW.
680	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SHOW IT IS ONLY IN LIGHT OF LEGAL CULTURE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE JURISPRUDENCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN BE EXPLAINED. EXAMINING THE CASE LAW CONCERNING THE EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE PROCEEDINGS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION RAISE QUESTIONS THAT STAND AT THE HEART OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER; THAT IS, THEY DEMAND THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE EU'S REGULATORY COMPETENCES ARE DRAWN. IN EFFECT, THE EU COURTS FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT EU CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS ARE IN ACCORD WITH THE RULE OF LAW OR, IN THE CONTEXT OF EU LAW, THE BORDERS OF THE EU'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY POWERS. AS SUCH, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF THE EU JUDICIARY. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED HERE TOGETHER WITH THE CONTINGENCY OF EU CLIMATE CHANGE LITIGATION ON EU LEGAL CULTURE.
681	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS FINDINGS FROM A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LATINO IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCES SEEKING HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE WAKE OF AN ANTI-IMMIGRANT "CRACKDOWN'' ORDINANCE SIMILAR TO ARIZONA'S SB 1070. PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, VIRGINIA'S 2007 "RULE OF LAW'' ORDINANCE ESCALATED LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS THAT TARGETED THIS POPULATION FOR DEPORTATION AND ORDERED STAFF TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE RECEIVE SOCIAL SERVICES OTHER THAN THOSE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE SOUGHT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS: (1) WERE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ABLE TO OBTAIN HEALTH CARE? (2) HOW DO IMMIGRANTS CHARACTERIZE THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH HEALTH PROVIDERS? DATA WERE GATHERED VIA SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N = 57) WITH LATINOS IN A LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD. ANALYSIS OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE NARRATIVES FOUND THAT MANY WERE DISSUADED FROM SEEKING CARE BECAUSE OF HIGH COSTS AS WELL AS LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OTHERS PERCEIVED THAT THEY WERE TREATED WITH INSENSITIVITY OR OUTRIGHT HOSTILITY-AND BELIEVED THIS TREATMENT WAS A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM SEEKING HELP.
682	THE PAPER ADDRESSES THE DILEMMA OF DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE POLICING METHODS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE HUMANE, SUSTAINABLE GOVERNANCE ADHERING TO THE RULE-OF-LAW BUT WHERE CONFLICT IS STILL CONTINUING, OFTEN DIRECTED AT MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THEMSELVES. IN BOTH BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTIONS THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT LOCAL POLICE CAN CONTRIBUTE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF THE POLICE VIS-A-VIS THE MILITARY IS NOT TO BECOME 'LITTLE SOLDIERS', DOING PROACTIVE COUNTER-INSURGENCY. INSTEAD, THEIR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IS TO RESPOND TO THE SECURITY NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LEGITIMACY OF STRUGGLING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS ROLE HAS BEEN ACCEPTED IN CONTEMPORARY WRITING BY MILITARY EXPERTS ON COUNTER-INSURGENCY AND IT ALSO REFLECTS RESEARCH ON THE ESSENTIAL ROLE POLICE CAN PLAY IN COUNTER-TERRORISM AND THE PREVENTION OF ORDINARY CRIME. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY, A TRAINING CURRICULUM IS SUGGESTED.
683	AS A NEW AND FLATTER ORGANIZATION REPLACES THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC ORGANIZATION, IT WOULD NEED MORE OF STRATEGIC PUBLIC MANAGEMENT. KEY DECISIONS IN TEAM PRODUCTION RELATE TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES FOR BOTH MONITORING OF REAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS THE REFORM OF THE STRUCTURING OF THESE ACTIVITIES. ONLY OUTCOME MEASURES COULD CONSTITUTE THE STARTING-POINT FOR PUBLIC SECTOR STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT. A CONCEPT OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT FOR PUBLIC SERVICES MUST INCLUDE A THEORY OF PUBLIC LEADERSHIP, RESULTING FROM THE MECHANISM OF CREDIT AND COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE TEAM PROVIDING SERVICES. A THEORY OF STRATEGIC PUBLIC MANAGEMENT MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS WELL AS INCLUDE THE IMPLICATIONS OF RULE OF LAW. GIVEN THE CRITICISMS OF THE RATIONAL DECISION MODEL, A THEORY OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE LESSONS FROM PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ABOUT BOUNDED RATIONALITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PATHOLOGIES OR ORGANIZED FOOLISHNESS IN PUBLIC ORGANIZATION.
684	ELECTIONS IN SERBIA IN 2008 PRODUCED THE FIRST CLEARLY PRO-EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT THERE SINCE THE MURDER OF PRIME MINISTER ZORAN DJINDIC IN 2003. THE ODD-COUPLE COALITION OF DJINDJIC'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE REMNANTS OF SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC'S SOCIALIST PARTY PUTS HIGH PRIORITY ON ATTAINING EU MEMBERSHIP. IT REJECTS KOSOVO'S DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF FEBRUARY 2008, BUT IT HAS RENOUNCED ANY USE OF FORCE TO RESTORE SERBIAN SOVEREIGNTY OVER KOSOVO. THE NEW SERBIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY ALLOWED THE EU RULE-OF-LAW TEAMS THAT ARE ADVISING INDEPENDENT KOSOVO TO DEPLOY IN SERB-MAJORITY NORTHERN KOSOVO IN DECEMBER 2008 AND IS WORKING WITH THEM TO SQUEEZE OUT OLD ULTRANATIONALIST PARTY BOSSES AND SMUGGLERS. ITS ACTIONS SUGGEST A FALLBACK OF SEEKING DE FACTO PARTITION OF NORTHERN KOSOVO FROM ALBANIAN-MAJORITY HEARTLAND KOSOVO. BELGRADE IS BARRED FROM EU MEMBERSHIP UNTIL FIND FINDS AND ARRESTS RATKO MLADIC, COMMANDER OF SERB TROOPS AT THE SREBRENICA MASSACRE OF ALMOST 8,000 UNARMED BOSNIAK MEN AND BOYS IN 1995.
685	HOW DOES THE U.S. SUPREME COURT REACH DECISIONS? SINCE THE 1940S, SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED ON TWO DISTINCT EXPLANATIONS. THE LEGAL MODEL SUGGESTS THAT THE RULE OF LAW (STARE DECISIS) IS THE KEY DETERMINANT. THE EXTRALEGAL MODEL POSITS THAT AN ARRAY OF SOCIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS PRODUCE JUDICIAL OUTCOMES. TO DETERMINE WHICH MODEL BETTER ACCOUNTED FOR JUDICIAL DECISIONS, WE USED SUPREME COURT CASES INVOLVING THE IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY SINCE 1972 AND ESTIMATED AND EVALUATED THE MODELS' SUCCESS IN ACCOUNTING FOR DECISIONAL OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS PERFORMED QUITE SATISFACTORILY, THEY POSSESSED DISTURBING WEAKNESSES. THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE OVERPREDICTED LIBERAL OUTCOMES, THE EXTRALEGAL MODEL CONSERVATIVE ONES. GIVEN THESE RESULTS, WE TESTED ANOTHER PROPOSITION, NAMELY THAT EXTRALEGAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS PRESENT CODEPENDENT, NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, EXPLANATIONS OF DECISION MAKING. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, WE OFFER AN INTEGRATED MODEL OF SUPREME COURT DECISION MAKING THAT CONTEMPLATES A RANGE OF POLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FORCES AND DOCTRINAL CONSTRAINTS.
686	HOFSTEDE'S SIX CULTURAL DIMENSIONS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO MEASURE THE CULTURE OF COUNTRIES BUT ARE CRITICIZED FOR ASSUMING THE HOMOGENEITY OF EACH COUNTRY. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE TWO MEASURES BASED ON HOFSTEDE'S CULTURAL DIMENSIONS WHICH TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HETEROGENEOUS STRUCTURE OF CITIZENS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. USING THESE IMPROVED MEASURES, WE STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF HETEROGENEOUS CULTURE AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY ON THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS MEASURED BY THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, WHICH ENCOMPASS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. WE USE A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL ALLOWING FOR DEPENDENCE IN SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DIMENSIONS AS WELL AS HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY IMPROVES SOME OF THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WHILE WORSENING OTHERS DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL HOFSTEDE CULTURAL DIMENSION. MOST NOTABLY, DIVERSITY IN THE POWER DISTANCE CULTURAL DIMENSION HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON POLITICAL STABILITY.
687	POPULIST CHIEF EXECUTIVES TEND TO WEAKEN DEMOCRACIES BY UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR INSIGHT INTO THE RESILIENCE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AGAINST SUCH THREATS, THIS ARTICLE TAKES A CLOSE LOOK AT HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN CONGRESS RESPONDED TO PRESIDENT DONALD J.TRUMP'S ATTACK ON THE LEGITIMACY OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS FOLLOWING HIS LOSS IN THE 2020 ELECTIONS. IT EXAMINES POST-2020 CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS' DECISIONS ABOUT PARTY POSITIONING, LEGISLATIVE PARTY LEADERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP, AND TRUMP'S STATUS AS PARTY LEADER. IN EACH SET OF DECISIONS, CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS PURSUED THEIR OWN INTERESTS RATHER THAN ECHOING TRUMP'S CLAIMS OR TAKING DIRECTION FROM HIM. CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS, HOWEVER, LARGELY DECLINED TO CRITICIZE TRUMP DIRECTLY IN LIGHT OF THEIR VOTERS' CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR HIM, SUPPORT THAT WAS EVIDENT IN THE 2022 REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES. THE OVERALL CONCLUSION IS THAT THE SELF-INTEREST OF SEPARATELY ELECTED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OFFERS A SIGNIFICANT, ALBEIT IMPERFECT DEFENSE AGAINST A POPULIST CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S BID FOR HEGEMONY.
688	IN CHINA, THE DIFFUSION OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IS EXTENSIVE, AS EVIDENCED BY THE COUNTRY'S INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE ACCESSIBILITY AND USAGE OF THE INTERNET, WEIBO, WECHAT, AND SHORT-VIDEO HOSTING SERVICES. CHINA'S RECENT WAVE OF LEGAL REFORM IS THE MANDATE OF JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF ADJUDICATORY PROCESS, COURT TRIALS, ADJUDICATORY DOCUMENTS, AND ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION. THE "RULE OF LAW" ENTAILS NOT ONLY AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEM BUT ALSO THE LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE POPULACE. HOW THE POPULACE APPRECIATES THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW AND, THUS, EMPLOYS IT TO PROTECT RIGHTS AND RESOLVE DISPUTES ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE OPTIMAL FUNCTIONING OF ALL LEGAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS. LEGAL ENCULTURATION WILL RESULT IN LEGALLY CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUALS WHO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. GIVEN THAT THE DIFFUSION OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN CHINA HAS BEEN RAPID AND WIDESPREAD, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY CAN FACILITATE BOTH JUDICIAL TRANSPARENCY AND LEGAL ENCULTURATION IN CHINA.
689	DRAWING ON THE INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX ALONG WITH ITS SUB-COMPONENTS ARE ANALYSED AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE CHOICE BETWEEN WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY AND JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS FROM INDIA IS EMPIRICALLY TESTED. THE RESULTS OF THE BINARY LOGISTIC MODEL REVEAL THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ALL ITS SUB-COMPONENTS ARE DECISIVE FACTORS IN EXPLAINING THE CHOICE OF ENTRY MODES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT SIZE, AND MARKET OPENNESS POSITIVELY DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OVER JOINT VENTURE WHILE REGULATORY EFFICIENCY AND OVERALL ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX ARE NEGATIVE REGRESSORS WHILE CONTROLLING FOR MARKET SIZE AND MARKET STABILITY. THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF THE STUDY IS THAT FOREIGN MARKET ENTRY CHOICE FROM AN ECONOMIC FREEDOM PERSPECTIVE IS NOT PRESENT IN THE EXTANT LITERATURE, SO THIS STUDY ENRICHES THE LITERATURE IN THIS REGARD. FURTHER, BESIDES THE EXPECTED PROBABILITY OF CHOOSING A PARTICULAR ENTRY MODE, THE MARGINAL CHANGE ACROSS THE VARIABLES IS ALSO ANALYSED.
690	PUBLIC SUPPORT IS CENTRAL TO THE EMERGENCE OF JUDICIAL POWER. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT CITIZEN COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW SUSTAINS THIS SUPPORT. AN IMPLICATION IS THAT SUCH COMMITMENTS SHOULD PROTECT COURTS FROM PARTISAN BACKLASH FOLLOWING CONTENTIOUS RULINGS. BUT THIS REMAINS LARGELY UNTESTED. THE KENYAN SUPREME COURT'S HISTORIC 2017 ELECTIONS RULINGS PROVIDE AN UNUSUAL OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THIS EXPECTATION. AFTER ANNULLING THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT'S VICTORY, THE COURT UPHELD HIS CONTROVERSIAL REPEAT-ELECTION WIN. WITH DATA FROM A NATIONAL PANEL SURVEY-CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE REPEAT ELECTION-WE FIND IMPORTANT PARTISAN-BASED WITHDRAWALS/INCREASES IN JUDICIAL-POWER SUPPORT. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES ATTENUATED PARTISAN BACKLASH; SOME WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS AMPLIFICATION. HOWEVER, PARTISAN LOSERS MAINTAIN MODERATELY HIGH SUPPORT DESPITE BACKLASH. RESULTS ADVANCE DEBATES ABOUT PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL POWER AND PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT PUBLIC REACTIONS TO ASSERTIONS OF JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IN NEW DEMOCRACIES AND ELECTORAL AUTOCRATIC REGIMES.
691	THE LITERATURE HAS DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF STATE INSTITUTIONS AND RULE OF LAW IN THE PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIZATION. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE CRUCIAL RELEVANCE OF DYNAMIC AND REPEATED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS IN NON-HOMOGENOUS POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, MOST RESEARCH LACKS SYSTEMATIC ANALYSES ON THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENTS, PARTIES AND PARTY SYSTEMS AFTER CIVIL WARS. WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF ELECTORAL SYSTEMS OR VETO RIGHTS AFTER POWER-SHARING AGREEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TRANSFORMATION OF REBEL GROUPS INTO POLITICAL PARTIES IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTIES WITHIN PARLIAMENTS HAS BEEN LARGELY IGNORED. THEREFORE, BY COMBINING CONFLICT STUDIES, INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN PERSPECTIVES AND PEACEBUILDING APPROACHES, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A RESEARCH AGENDA ON THE OVERLOOKED ROLE PLAYED BY PARLIAMENT AS A CRUCIAL ARENA FOR A BETTER ANALYSIS, IN THE LONG TERM, OF POWER-SHARING MECHANISMS AND STATE-BUILDING, POST-WAR POLITICAL FRAMING AND NARRATIVES, ETHNIC OUTBIDDING AND PARTY MODERNIZATION STRATEGIES.
692	CHINA'S DISASTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONTAINS NO LAW-BASED PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS; HOWEVER, THE NATIONAL LEADER'S INSTRUCTIONS (PISHI IN CHINESE) PLAY A SIMILAR ROLE TO DISASTER DECLARATIONS, WHICH INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF DISASTER RELIEF. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHAT AFFECTS PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER INSTRUCTIONS WITHIN AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHINA'S DISASTER POLITICS DEPEND ON A CRISIS THRESHOLD SYSTEM FOR OPERATION AND THAT THE PUBLIC AND SOCIAL FEATURES OF DISASTERS ARE AT THE CORE OF THIS SYSTEM. CHINA'S POLITICAL CYCLE HAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DISASTER POLITICS. A CHANGE IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HAS A SIGNIFICANT BEARING ON PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER INSTRUCTIONS, REFLECTING THE STRONG INFLUENCE OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW AND BENEFITING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF DISASTER POLITICS RESEARCH, UNLOCKING THE BLACK BOX OF CHINA'S DISASTER POLITICS AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES WILL BENEFIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL STUDY.
693	COLOMBIA'S CONSTITUTION OF 1991 ESTABLISHED CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AS ONE OF THE BASIC FOUNDATIONS FOR CONSOLIDATING A SOCIAL STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. OBEYING THIS MANDATE, DIFFERENT PARTICIPATION INSTANCES WERE CREATED THAT. ACCORDING TO THE NORM, THESE INSTANCES IMPEL CITIZENS TO COMPLY WITH THIS MANDATE. HOWEVER, ADEQUATE MECHANISMS FOR THE INSTANCES' OPERATION WERE NOT IMPLEMENTED. FACED WITH THIS SITUATION, CITIZENS AUTONOMOUSLY CREATED OTHER NON-FORMAL INSTANCES IN WHICH THE STRUCTURING ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION MAY BE IDENTIFIED. THE PRESENT PAPER ANALYZES THIS TENSE SITUATION BY COMPARING NORMATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOTH SCENARIOS AND SEEKS TO IDENTIFY IN WHICH OF THEM IS PARTICIPATION BEST REPRESENTED, FROM THE STARTING POINT OF THEIR FOUNDATION, INCLUDING THEIR ACTIVE PRACTICE AND CONTROL OF POLITICAL POWER. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT AT PRESENT, FORMAL SCENARIOS ARE NOT ADEQUATE MEANS FOR CITIZENS TO INTERVENE ASSERTIVELY IN THE CONFORMATION, PRACTICE AND CONTROL OF POLITICAL POWER, BECAUSE IT DOES NOT BRING THE NECESSARY REPRESENTATIVENESS AND LEGITIMACY.
694	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO RESEARCH, THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY, THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES (NEW EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERS) AND CROATIA, IN THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2012. IN ORDER TO PROVE THE HYPOTHESIS, WE WILL USE PANEL ANALYSIS OF TRANSITION ECONOMIES AND CROATIA, NAMELY THE ARELLANO-BOND DYNAMIC PANEL ANALYSIS. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES TWO DEPENDENT VARIABLES (GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA [G.D.P./P.C.]AND THE SHARE OF EXPORT IN G.D.P.) AND FIVE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (TOTAL HERITAGE INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (W.G.I.) GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS INDICATOR, W.G.I. RULE OF LAW INDICATOR, CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX AND THE INDEX OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF TRANSITION COUNTRIES AND CROATIA, WHICH CREATES PRECONDITIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE GROWTH RATE OF THE CROATIAN ECONOMY.
695	A FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A "CIRCULATORY SYSTEM" OF THE STATE, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR ITS EXISTENCE. A KEY ROLE IN THIS SYSTEM BELONGS TO PUBLIC FUNDS. THAT IS WHY ISSUES OF IMPROVING EFFICIENT STATE AUDIT ARE BECOMING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NOWADAYS. ACCORDING TO "LIMA DECLARATION OF GUIDELINES ON AUDITING PRECEPTS" : AUDIT IS NOT AN END IN ITSELF BUT AN INDISPENSABLE PART OF A REGULATORY SYSTEM WHOSE AIM IS TO REVEAL DEVIATIONS FROM ACCEPTED STANDARDS AND VIOLATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, EFFICIENCY, EFFECTIVENESS AND ECONOMY OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT EARLY ENOUGH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IN INDIVIDUAL CASES, TO MAKE THOSE ACCOUNTABLE ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY, TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION, OR TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT - OR AT LEAST RENDER MORE DIFFICULT - SUCH BREACHES (LIMA DECLARATION, 1977). WHEREAS LIMA DECLARATION SETS ESSENTIAL PREMISES FOR REALLY INDEPENDENT AND, AS A RESULT, EFFECTIVE STATE AUDIT WHICH IS THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, TRANSPARENCY OF STATE AUDIT ACTIVITIES BECOMES REASONABLY IMPORTANT.
696	VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS IS A ZOONOTIC DISEASE TRANSMITTED BY A VECTOR OF GLOBAL IMPORTANCE, WHICH INVOLVES DOGS AS RESERVOIRS. THE "ELIMINATION OF RESERVOIRS" IS SPECIFICALLY DETERMINED AS A CONTROL MEASURE IN THE MANUAL DE VIGILANCIA E CONTROLE DE LEISHMANIOSE VISCERAL [MANUAL OF SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL OF VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS] PUBLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SURVEILLANCE OF THE BRAZILIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE ELIMINATION OF SEROPOSITIVE DOGS IN BRAZIL, USED TO CONTROL VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS, HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE. THIS PAPER RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY INSTRUMENT BASED ON CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND ANALYSIS OF THE BRAZILIAN LAW, HELD FROM THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE AND THE RECOGNITION OF ANIMALS AS SENTIENT BEINGS. IT CONCLUDES THAT AN IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION AND A REVIEW OF ANIMAL EXTERMINATION PRACTICE IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW IS NEEDED AND THE ADOPTION OF PREVENTIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE METHODS TO ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH WITHOUT PROVIDING EITHER EMOTIONAL COSTS TO DOG OWNERS NOR BURDENING THE PUBLIC BUDGET.
697	DEMOCRACIES PURSUE PEACEFUL CONFLICT RESOLUTION WITH EACH OTHER AS WELL AS IN THEIR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. THIS 'EMPIRICAL LAW' IS KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC PEACE (PAX DEMOCRATICA), BUT IT LACKS A PERSUASIVE THEORETICAL EXPLANATION. UTILIZING PSYCHOLOGY, DEMOCRATIC PEACE CAN BE EXPLAINED BY FRUSTRATION-AGGRESSION AND PROXIMITY THEORIES. THE SUBSTANCE OF DEMOCRACY INCLUDES THE CULTURE OF FREEDOM AND EQUALITY. FREEDOMS REDUCE FRUSTRATION AND THUS INSTIGATION TO AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR. NONVIOLENCE IS ALSO ENCOURAGED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROXIMITY - REDUCTION IN HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE. HORIZONTAL CLOSENESS DEPENDS ON SHARED IDENTITY - CIVIC NATIONALISM, CIVIC CULTURE, AND HUMANISM/CIVILITY; VERTICAL CLOSENESS DEPENDS ON EQUALITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND POPULAR ELECTIONS WITH A GENERAL RIGHT TO VOTE AND HOLD OFFICE. IN CONCLUSION, REDUCED FRUSTRATION AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL PROXIMITY DIMINISH AGGRESSION AND FACILITATE PEACEFUL CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THE SOURCES OF DEMOCRATIC PEACE THUS LIE IN THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL PREREQUISITES OF DEMOCRACY ITSELF. DEMOCRACY AND PEACE CANNOT BE INTRODUCED OR PRESERVED WITHOUT THESE PRECONDITIONS.
698	IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMAND FOR JUDGES TO BE OBJECTIVE. ETHICAL CODES SHOW THAT OBJECTIVITY DEPENDS ON RULES ENABLING INDIVIDUALS TO COUNTER THEIR SUBJECTIVITY. YET THESE CODES FOCUS ON JUDGES' GENERAL BEHAVIOUR WHILE METHODOLOGY STRIVES FOR OBJECTIVITY IN THE JUDGES' CORE TASK OF APPLYING THE LAW ON A SPECIFIC CASE. VARIOUS METHODS ARE EXAMINED WHETHER THEY GUARANTEE OR AT LEAST CONTRIBUTE TO AN OBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW WITHIN THE EXISTING MARGIN OF INTERPRETATION. CONSCIOUS APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY IS ELABORATED UPON AS A DEMAND OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ALREADY LIMITS CONTROL OF THE EXTERNAL RESULT OF THE ADJUDICATION PROCESS, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE INTERNAL PROCESS OF APPLYING THE LAW THAT TAKES PLACE ONLY INSIDE THE JUDGE'S HEAD. THUS, IT IS UP TO EACH JUDGE TO ENSURE OBJECTIVITY BY INTERNALLY BINDING THEMSELVES TO A CONSCIOUS APPLICATION OF METHODS - THEREFORE CONSTITUTING AN ETHICAL DEMAND.
699	MANY BELIEVE THAT DUTIES SHOULD BE AT THE ESSENCE OF CITIZENSHIP. THIS PAPER DISMISSES THIS VIEW, USING EU LAW AS THE MAIN CONTEXT OF ANALYSIS, BY MAKING FIVE INTERRELATED CLAIMS. (1) THERE ARE NO EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE DUTIES OF EU CITIZENSHIP; (2) SUCH DUTIES WOULD LACK ANY LEGAL-THEORETICAL FOUNDATION, IF THE CONTRARY WERE TRUE; (3) LEGAL-THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP ARE LACKING ALSO AT THE MEMBER STATE LEVEL; (4) EU LAW PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN UNDERMINING THE ABILITY OF THE MEMBER STATES WHERE RESIDUAL DUTIES REMAIN TO ENFORCE THEM; (5) THIS DEVELOPMENT IS PART OF A GREATER EU INPUT INTO THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE MEMBER STATES AND REFLECTS A GENERAL TREND OF DE-DUTIFICATION OF CITIZENSHIP AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC WORLD. IF THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE CORRECT, IT IS TIME TO STOP CATEGORISING EU CITIZENSHIP DUTIES AMONG THE DESIDERATA OF EU LAW.
700	THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE NORMAL VALUE DETERMINATION OF NME AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRIBUTING TO DOHA ANTIDUMPING REFORM DELIBERATION. FROM DOMESTIC TO INTERNATIONAL ARENAS, ANTIDUMPING DEVELOPMENT SEES THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT PATERNALISTIC DISCRETION TURNING ANTIDUMPING INTO A DISTRIBUTIVE INSTRUMENT CHALLENGING CONSTITUTIONALISM. DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDE OF THE 1950S, NME METHODOLOGY'S OBSESSION WITH NATIONAL DIVIDE TURNS FREE TRADE FROM TRADERS' COMMUTATIVE EXCHANGE TO NATIONS' DISTRIBUTIVE PREDATION. NME DISTRIBUTIVE DISCRETION, THOUGH AGAINST THE FREE MARKET PRINCIPLE, IS IRONICALLY USED TO ACCUSE FOREIGN ECONOMIES OF NOT BEING FREE-MARKET ENOUGH. WHEN PRODUCTS AND PRODUCERS ARE GIVEN CERTAIN STATUS VIA NATIONALITY INSTEAD OF TREATED INDIVIDUALLY, ANTIDUMPING DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN A PROCESS "FROM STATUS TO CONTRACT" AND BACK. THEREFORE, IT IS TIME TO DE-LEGITIMIZE THE NME METHODOLOGY, AND THE SUCCESS OF ANTIDUMPING REFORM LIES IN LIMITING RATHER THAN DEFERRING TO GOVERNMENTS' PATERNALISTIC DISCRETION, THUS STRENGTHENING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF WTO.
701	IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, MANY AMERICAN STATES AND LOCALITIES ARE UNDERTAKING THEIR OWN LEGAL REFORMS. THE NEW STATE AND LOCAL LAWS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED BY IMMIGRANT-RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY PRE-EMPTED THE FIELD. THE LAWSUITS BRING A NEW NARRATIVE VOICE-THAT OF JUDGES-INTO THE BOILING U.S. IMMIGRATION DEBATE. JUDGES ENGAGE THE CONTROVERSY OVER LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AS THEY HAVE OTHER CONTENTIOUS DISPUTES, BOTH AS PRAGMATIC DECISION-MAKERS AND AS SPOKESPERSONS FOR JUSTICE. THE TENSIONS THIS DUAL ROLE ENTAILS ARE EXPLORED HERE IN THE CONTEXT OF A SINGLE, CONTROVERSIAL CASE. CLOSE-UP ANALYSIS OF THE JUDGE'S NARRATIVE STRATEGY REVEALS A RANGE OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES TO CREATE MORAL DISTANCE FROM A DECISION, COMBINED, IRONICALLY, WITH THE ENLISTMENT OF MORAL THEMES TO JUSTIFY THE RULING. THE INTER-TWINING OF RULE-OF-LAW AND JUSTICE RHETORIC MIRRORS AND ALSO SHAPES A BROADER POLITICS OF JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES.
702	WHETHER GLOBALIZATION IMPROVES OR UNDERMINES HUMAN RIGHTS IS NOT A MATTER THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE SHORT TERM. GLOBALIZATION IS THE SECOND "GREAT TRANSFORMATION" SPREADING CAPITALISM OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD. MANY OF ITS SHORT-TERM EFFECTS WILL BE NEGATIVE. NEVERTHELESS, ITS MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS MAY WELL BE POSITIVE, AS IT IMPELS SOCIAL CHANGES THAT WILL RESULT IN GREATER MOVES TO DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC REDISTRIBUTION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTION OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. CAPITALISM IS A NECESSARY, THOUGH HARDLY SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR DEMOCRACY: DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST POLITICAL SYSTEM TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE NON-WESTERN WORLD WILL FOLLOW THE EXACT SAME PATH TO PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT THE WESTERN WORLD FOLLOWED. NO INTERNATIONAL LAW OBLIGED THE WEST TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS DURING ITS OWN ERA OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION. THUS, THE WEST COULD PRACTICE SLAVERY, EXPEL SURPLUS POPULATIONS, AND COLONIZE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANING WERE NOT PROHIBITED.
703	SCHOLARS LOOSELY AFFILIATED WITH THE "CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL" (E.G., POCOCK, SKINNER, VIROLI, AND PETTIT) ACCENTUATE RULE OF LAW, COMMON GOOD, CLASS EQUILIBRIUM, AND NON-DOMINATION IN MACHIAVELLI'S POLITICAL THOUGHT AND REPUBLICANISM GENERALLY BUT UNDERESTIMATE THE FLORENTINE'S PREFERENCE FOR CLASS CONFLICT AND IGNORE HIS INSISTENCE ON ELITE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THEY OBSCURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH MACHIAVELLI IS AN ANTI-ELITIST CRITIC OF THE REPUBLICAN TRADITION, WHICH THEY FAIL TO DISCLOSE WAS PREDOMINANTLY OLIGARCHIC. THE PRESCRIPTIVE LESSONS THESE SCHOLARS DRAW FROM REPUBLICANISM FOR CONTEMPORARY POLITICS REINFORCE RATHER THAN REFORM THE "SENATORIAL," ELECTORALLY BASED, AND SOCIOECONOMICALLY AGNOSTIC REPUBLICAN MODEL (DEVISED BY MACHIAVELLI'S ARISTOCRATIC INTERLOCUTOR, GUICCIARDINI, AND REFINED BY MONTESQUIEU AND MADISON) THAT PERMITS COMMON CITIZENS TO ACCLAIM BUT NOT DETERMINE GOVERNMENT POLICIES. CAMBRIDGE SCHOOL TEXTUAL INTERPRETATIONS AND PRACTICAL PROPOSALS HAVE LITTLE CONNECTION WITH MACHIAVELLI'S "TRIBUNATE," CLASS-SPECIFIC MODEL OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT ELABORATED IN THE DISCOURSES, ONE THAT RELIES ON EXTRA-ELECTORAL ACCOUNTABILITY TECHNIQUES AND EMBRACES DELIBERATIVE POPULAR ASSEMBLIES.
704	THIS ARTICLE RELATES CONTEMPORARY EFFORTS TO REFORM FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE POLICYMAKING WITH RECENT CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL COURTS' APPROACH TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE LEGALITY OF AGENCY ACTION. THESE CHANGES COALESCE INTO A MOVEMENT TOWARD A ''DELEGALIZATION'' OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, BY WHICH THE AUTHOR MEANS THE PURPOSEFUL EFFORT BY POLICYMAKERS AND JUDGES TO FREE AGENCIES FROM THE BINDING NORMS THAT CONTROL THE PROCESS AND CONTENT OF THEIR DECISIONMAKING. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THESE REVISIONS IS TO UNDERMINE THE AGENCY'S ROLE AS THE CENTRAL DECISIONMAKER IN SHAPING AND IMPLEMENTING PUBLIC POLICY, AS WELL AS TO COMPROMISE THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY AS GUARANTOR OF THE LEGITIMACY AND LEGALITY OF THAT POLICY. THUS, WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE CHANGES SIGNAL A PROFOUND RETHINKING OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. THIS RETHINKING FUNDAMENTALLY CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND WITH IT, THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT MAKES THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE ACCEPTABLE TO AMERICAN SOCIETY.
705	THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE ROLE PLAYED BY LEGAL CLINICS IN DEVELOPING THE SKILLS OF LAW STUDENTS BY INTEGRATING THEM WITH THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF THE LAW. THIS STUDY ALSO EXPLAINS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LEGAL CLINICS IN SUPPORTING WEAK AND MARGINALIZED GROUPS THAT CANNOT BEAR THE COSTS AND BURDENS OF LAYERS AND PROMOTING PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN ADDITION, THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGAL CLINIC AT AN-NAJAH NATIONAL UNIVERSITY IN PALESTINE AS A CASE STUDY. THIS STUDY SHOWS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF LEGAL CLINICS IN BOTH PARTICIPATING IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND ENHANCING STUDENTS' SKILLS. THE RESEARCHER USE A MIXED APPROACH TO COLLECT THE NEEDED DATA THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND CONTENT ANALYSIS IN A DESK RESEARCH METHOD. THE RESEARCHER HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL CLINICS IN PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH PRACTICAL SKILLS AND IMPROVING THEIR AWARENESS OF THEIR RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO COME FROM UNPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES.
706	ACCORDING TO HANNAH ARENDT, THE ORIGINAL MATRIX OF TOTALITARIANISM IS TO BE BE IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTRADICTORY LOGIC FEEDING THE NATION-STATE. IT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF TENSION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSALISTIC VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY ON THE ONE HAND, AND A PARTICULARISTIC SUBSTANCE, BASED ON THE MATERIAL CHARACTER OF A SENSE OF BELONGING INSPIRED BY ORGANIC CONCEPTIONS OF THE SOCIAL BOND, ON THE OTHER. THE THESIS OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS THAT HANNAH ARENDT'S REFLECTIONS SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO A TRAGIC, BUT UNREPEATABLE PAST. CONTEMPORARY SOVEREIGN AND NATIONALIST POPULISM ALSO TENDS TO DENY PLURALISM AND POLITICAL AND IDENTITY DIFFERENTIATION. IN THE POPULIST IMAGINATION, THERE IS ONLY ROOM FOR A "COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE" WHERE RELATIONS BETWEEN CITIZENS ARE THE EXPRESSION OF A PREPOLITICAL UNITY BASED ON A SENSE OF BELONGING INSPIRED BY ORGANIC CONCEPTIONS OF THE SOCIAL BOND AND WHICH, IN PRINCIPLE, THEREFORE EXCLUDES EVERY DISSONANT VOICE.
707	THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS REMAINS A DEFINING FEATURE OF AMERICAN LAW DESPITE CHALLENGES TO ITS LEGITIMACY AND EFFICACY. EVEN SO, THERE IS SPACE BETWEEN THE ROLE THAT STARE DECISIS CURRENTLY PLAYS AND THE POTENTIAL THAT IT OFFERS. THE GAP IS EVIDENT IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. THOUGH THE JUSTICES CONTINUE TO UNDERSCORE THE FUNDAMENTAL STATUS OF STARE DECISIS, THE COURT'S OPINIONS SOMETIMES SEEM QUICK TO DEPART FROM PRECEDENTS WHOSE REASONING HAS FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR. USING BIVENS V. SIX UNKNOWN NAMED AGENTS AS A CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW THE COURT CAN INVIGORATE THE DOCTRINE OF STARE DECISIS IN PURSUIT OF A STABLE AND IMPERSONAL RULE OF LAW. VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF MODERN INTERPRETIVE PHILOSOPHY, BIVENS MIGHT WELL BE ANACHRONISTIC. YET BY COMMITTING THEMSELVES TO PRECEDENTS OF PRECISELY THAT SORT, THE JUSTICES CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT CHANGES IN JUDICIAL PERSONNEL-AND ATTENDANT SHIFTS IN THE PREVAILING WINDS OF LEGAL THEORY-DO NOT ALWAYS TRANSLATE INTO CHANGES IN THE LAW.
708	PURPOSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS REVISITED. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A PANEL COINTEGRATION METHODOLOGY AND CAUSALITY ANALYSIS ARE APPLIED TO 27 POSTSOCIALIST ECONOMIES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2016. FINDINGS UTILIZING THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AS A MEANS OF ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS, IT IS FOUND THAT IN THE LONG RUN, ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE SHORT RUN, REGULATORY QUALITY RETAINS A POSITIVE EFFECT, BUT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY DEMONSTRATE A PUZZLING NEGATIVE EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT MERITS FURTHER ANALYSIS. IN EXPLORING THE CAUSAL DIMENSION OF OUR VARIABLES, SUPPORTING EVIDENCE OF THE STRONG LINKS BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS PROVIDED, HENCE RENDERING ROBUST RESULTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, IT IS THE FIRST TIME THAT AN ARDL METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH ADDRESSES POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY ISSUES, IS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GROWTH IN THE CONTEXT OF POSTSOCIALIST ECONOMIES.
709	IN RESPONSE TO THE REPUBLICAN REVIVAL OF THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION, A NUMBER OF 'RADICAL', 'LABOUR' AND 'WORKPLACE' REPUBLICANS HAVE CRITICISED THE LIMITATIONS OF PHILIP PETTIT'S ACCOUNT OF FREEDOM AND GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT THE MISSING LINK IN THESE DEBATES IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPUBLICANISM AND SOCIALISM. SEEKING TO BRING THIS CONNECTION BACK INTO VIEW IN HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL TERMS, THE ARTICLE DRAWS FROM CONTEMPORARY RADICAL REPUBLICANS AND THE WRITINGS OF KARL KAUTSKY AND ROSA LUXEMBURG TO PROPOSE A SOCIALIST REPUBLICAN THEORY OF FREEDOM AND GOVERNMENT. THIS CONSISTS OF A CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM AS COLLECTIVE AUTONOMY AND A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRATIC VISION OF A DECENTRALISED STATE WITH PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, WORKER-CONTROLLED WORKPLACES, COMMUNITY-DIRECTED INVESTMENT AND A POLITICAL CULTURE OF SOLIDARITY AND PUBLIC-SPIRITEDNESS. THIS THEORY OF SOCIALIST REPUBLICANISM SEEKS TO OVERCOME THE WEAKNESSES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RESPECTIVE INDEPENDENT THEORY AND SHOULD APPEAL TO REPUBLICANS AND SOCIALISTS ALIKE.
710	IN THE LAST DECADE UN PEACE OPERATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO EXPLICITLY SEEK STABILIZATION' IN THE STATES TO WHICH THEY ARE DEPLOYED. DESPITE THE TERM BEING INCLUDED IN THE TITLES OF FOUR MISSIONS, THREE OF WHICH ARE AMONGST THE FOUR LARGEST OPERATIONS CURRENTLY DEPLOYED, AND STABILIZATION ACTIVITIES BEING INCLUDED IN THE MANDATES, THERE IS NO UN-WIDE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM. INSTEAD, THE MANDATES INCLUDE VARYING ACTIVITIES UNDER THE HEADING OF STABILIZATION DEPENDING ON THE MISSION. CONCURRENTLY, STABILIZATION MISSIONS HAVE SEEN THE USE OF LANGUAGE SUCH AS ROBUST POSTURE' AND ACTIVE PATROLLING', INCREASED LOGISTICAL CAPABILITIES FROM WESTERN MILITARY HARDWARE, THE ENCROACHMENT OF A COUNTER-TERRORISM RHETORIC, OPERATIONS ALONGSIDE HOST STATE FORCES, AND AN EMPHASIS ON (RE)ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGAL EFFECTS THESE TRENDS COULD HAVE. DUE TO THE COMPETING INTERESTS INTRODUCED BY STABILIZATION IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MANDATES ISSUED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL REQUIRE FURTHER CLARITY AND HARMONISATION TO PREVENT THE PURSUIT OF LASTING PEACE FROM BEING UNDERMINED.
711	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF COPYRIGHT INDUSTRIES FOR THE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES AND ARGUES THAT CRIMINAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IS A WIDESPREAD OFFENSE, PRODUCING MAJOR ECONOMIC LOSSES FOR STAKEHOLDERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CREATIVITY, AND RAISING SIGNIFICANT CYBERSECURITY AND RULE OF LAW CONCERNS. THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY THERE IS A NEED FOR CRIMINAL PROTECTION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND OUTLINES THE U.S. FRAMEWORK. IN A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH, BASED ON A LARGE CORPUS OF DATA, CONSISTING OF CASES BROUGHT TO FEDERAL COURTS, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 506 OF TITLE 17 OF THE U.S. CODE, AND PRESS RELEASES AND REPORTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDUSTRY GROUPS, SECTION 3 DESCRIBES THE FORMS AND EXTENT OF THE PHENOMENON. SECTION 4 DISCUSSES ESSENTIAL ASPECTS INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION OF THESE CASES. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CASES BROUGHT TO COURTS VERSUS THE CRIMINAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGING REPORTS AND ESTIMATES, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THIS CRIMINAL PHENOMENON IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER-PROSECUTED AND PROPOSES A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT COULD IMPROVE THE CRIMINAL PROTECTION OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS.
712	THROUGH PARTICIPATORY OBSERVATION AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH THIRTY-FOUR PRACTITIONERS, THIS ARTICLE PIERCES THE VEIL OF THE DYNAMICS OF CHINA'S PRETRIAL DETENTION SYSTEM BY LOOKING INTO VARIOUS SOCIO-LEGAL FACTORS WHICH MAY AFFECT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CHINA. WHEN THE PROSECUTORS MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON DETENTION IN PRACTICE, A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS STATE COMPENSATION, PERFORMANCE-BASED EVALUATION AS WELL AS JUDICIAL ECOLOGY SUCH AS PUBLIC OPINION, POWER STRUGGLE, AND JUDICIAL COORDINATION ALL PLAY A ROLE. THE DYNAMICS OF CHINA'S DETENTION SYSTEM, THROUGH GOVERNING THE PROSECUTORS' DAILY OPERATIONS AND THE PROCURATORATE'S ROUTINE POLICY-MAKING, OFTEN DISTORT THE PRETRIAL DETENTION SYSTEM THAT IS MAINLY REGULATED BY THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW AND IN PRACTICE, RESULT IN A HIGH RATE OF CUSTODY. THE DYNAMICS ALSO SUGGEST A NON-AUTONOMOUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CHINA, MEANING THAT EXTRA-LEGAL FACTORS USUALLY INFLUENCE, COMPLICATE, AND SOMETIMES EVEN RE-DIRECT CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
713	SINGAPORE EXEMPLIFIES WHAT CHINA STRIVES FOR: RESILIENT AUTHORITARIANISM DESPITE ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL STABILITY. BUT LESSONS CHINESE OBSERVERS DRAW FROM THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN CITY-STATE HAVE BEEN SELECTIVE, LEADING TO MISCONCEPTIONS. WE FOCUS ON THREE KEY AREAS IN WHICH CHINESE OBSERVERS CLAIM INSPIRATION FROM THE "SINGAPORE MODEL." THE FIRST, SINGAPORE'S "ASIAN VALUES" DISCOURSE WHICH IS SEEN TO PROVIDE AN IDEOLOGICAL DEFENSE OF NON-DEMOCRATIC RULE, OVERESTIMATES THE IMPACT OF TOP-DOWN CONSERVATIVE CULTURALISM WHILE UNDERESTIMATING THE DIFFICULTY OF PROPAGATING CONFUCIANISM IN OFFICIALLY STILL COMMUNIST CHINA. SECOND, WHILE ELECTIONS IN SINGAPORE ARE SEEN TO BOLSTER THE RULING PEOPLE ACTION PARTY'S LEGITIMACY IN SINGAPORE, THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO SUCH A LIMITED EXTENT IN CHINA THAT ANY LEGITIMATION GAIN IS UNLIKELY. FINALLY, THE CHIEF LESSON DERIVED FROM SINGAPORE'S FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, THE IMPORTANCE OF A COMMITTED LEADERSHIP, IGNORES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SINGAPORE, A LEGACY OF COLONIALISM VERY DIFFERENT FROM CHINA'S POST-TOTALITARIAN TRAJECTORY.
714	KAZAKHSTAN RANKS CONSISTENTLY LOW ON MEASURES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND THE RULE OF LAW MORE GENERALLY.(1) ECHOING THESE EVALUATIONS, EXISTING LITERATURE EMPHASIZES THE DEGREE TO WHICH INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS SHAPE PROPERTY RELATIONS IN PERSONALIST, AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, LIKE KAZAKHSTAN. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT FORMAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE LAW AND COURTS FAIL TO RESTRAIN OR OTHERWISE INFLUENCE STATE AGENTS' RENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOR. IN EFFECT, THEY SERVE PRIMARILY AS ORNAMENTATION. REGARDLESS, THESE EXPLANATIONS FAIL TO EXPLAIN WHY BOTH CITIZENS AND THE STATE REGULARLY TURN TO THESE INSTITUTIONS TO SETTLE PROPERTY DISPUTES. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON CONFLICTS OVER EMINENT DOMAIN AND FINDS THAT IN THESE CASES THE LAW PROVIDES LOWER AND UPPER BOUNDS FOR OFFICIALS' RENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOR. WITHIN THESE LIMITS, LAW COMBINES WITH INFORMAL PRACTICES TO DETERMINE LEGAL OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH THE LAW AND COURTS SOMETIMES PROVIDE CITIZENS WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR LIMITED REDRESS, THEY ALSO HELP FACILITATE AND LEGITIMIZE OFFICIALS' USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT.
715	THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW DIRECT ACTIONS AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALISABLE THROUGH PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION. FOR 53 YEARS IT HAS HELD ON TO ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE STANDING CRITERIA IN (NOW) ARTICLE 263 TFEU, SEVERELY LIMITING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL BUT THE MOST SPECIFIC OF CASES. THE CRITICISM OF THIS INTERPRETATION HAS BEEN COPIOUS AND STRONG, NEWLY INVIGORATED IN RECENT YEARS BY ARGUMENTS ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE AIMS NOT TO ADD TO THE CRITICISM BUT TO OFFER A COMPELLING EXPLANATION OF THE 'WHY' BEHIND THE COURT'S REASONING. BY MAKING USE OF A FRAMEWORK THAT ADDRESSES A SUPREME COURT'S INTERPRETATIVE LIMITS REGARDING LOCUS STANDI, THIS ARTICLE WILL NOT ONLY SHED LIGHT ON THE PAST BUT EQUALLY EXPLAIN WHY THE COURT HAS CHOSEN TO REJECT PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION, IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE SEEM COUNTER-INTUITIVE.
716	THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC IS ANALYSED WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF LIMITED AND OPEN ACCESS ORDERS. BEFORE WORLD WAR I, IMPERIAL GERMANY HAD DEVELOPED INTO A MATURE LIMITED ACCESS ORDER WITH RULE OF LAW AND OPEN ECONOMIC ACCESS BUT LACK OF COMPETITION IN POLITICS. AFTER WORLDWAR I AND INFLATION, WEIMAR GERMANY DEVELOPED TOWARD AN OPEN ACCESS ORDER; OPEN ACCESS WAS NOT, HOWEVER, SUSTAINABLE AND COLLAPSED IN 1930-31. THIS CASE OF A FAILED OPEN ACCESS ORDER SUGGESTS REFINING THE FRAMEWORK OF LIMITED AND OPEN ACCESS ORDERS IN FURTHER WORK. IT SHOWS THAT THE POLITICAL PROCESS OF "CREATIVE DESTRUCTION'' MIGHT RESULT IN DISSOLUTION OF OPEN ACCESS AND THAT THE POLITICAL SYSTEM NEEDS THE CAPACITY OF EFFICIENTLY CREATING LEGITIMACY IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OPENNESS. THE FAILURE OF WEIMAR GERMANY ALSO INDICATES THAT THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEM MIGHT WORK AS A DESTABILIZING FACTOR OF OPEN ACCESS AND THAT THE NATION-STATE PERSPECTIVE OF THE LIMITED AND OPEN ACCESS ORDER FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO BE SUPPLEMENTED BY AN INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE.
717	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES A SELECTION OF ARCHIVAL RECORDS CREATED AND PRESERVED IN RELATION TO THE ABORIGINAL OUTLAW JIMMY GOVERNOR. IT FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR UPON A SPECIAL DIARY KEPT BY THE OFFICERS GUARDING HIM DURING HIS TIME IN THE CONDEMNED CELL AT DARLINGHURST GAOL IN 1900-01. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THESE RECORDS AND THE VARIOUS MICROFILM AND DIGITAL SURROGATES USED BY SCHOLARS IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDANCES OF THEIR SPECIFIC MATERIALITY. IT ADVANCES AN ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW THESE PARTICULAR ARCHIVAL RECORDS FUNCTION AS EVIDENCE OF LAW, DUTY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. WHEREAS IN THE PAST JIMMY GOVERNOR'S STORY HAS PRIMARILY BEEN TOLD IN THE GENRE OF LAW-BREAKING, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE ARCHIVAL RECORDS INSTEAD REVEAL HIM AS AN AGENT OF LAWMAKING. WHEN EXAMINED AS PAGES AND AS PAPER, THE VARIOUS DOCUMENTS THAT COMPRISE THE JIMMY GOVERNOR ARCHIVE PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN A COLONIAL SOCIETY ON THE BRINK OF FEDERATION.
718	THE REGULATION-BY-ENFORCEMENT CRITIQUE HAS MADE AN IMPACT AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND SCHOLARS ARE BEGINNING TO TURN THIS CRITIQUE AGAINST OTHER AGENCIES. USING THIS CRITIQUE, THIS NOTE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FEDERAL COMBINATION RULES FOR THE LENDING-LIMIT LAW SHOULD BE REWRITTEN. UNDER THE LENDING-LIMIT LAW, NATIONAL BANKING ASSOCIATIONS MAY LEND ONLY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEIR UNIMPAIRED CAPITAL AND UNIMPAIRED SURPLUS TO ANY ONE BORROWER. ALTHOUGH THE COMBINATION RULES INCLUDE SEVERAL PER SE RULES PURSUANT TO WHICH LOANS MADE TO TWO BORROWERS WILL BE AGGREGATED, THEY ALSO GRANT THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC) THE POWER TO DETERMINE AD HOC WHETHER TO AGGREGATE TWO LOANS. THIS POWER TO DETERMINE ON AN AD HOC AND EVEN ON A POST HOC BASIS WHETHER A VIOLATION OF THE LAW HAS OCCURRED IS AN AFFRONT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND IS UNFAIR TO THE INDUSTRY. THE COMBINATION RULES SHOULD BE AMENDED TO REMOVE THE OCC'S POWER TO MAKE AD HOC DETERMINATIONS.
719	IN THIS ARTICLE WE SEEK THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF EXPOSING AND CONTRASTING TWO OF THE VARIOUS TRADITIONS THAT HAVE THOUGHT THE PROBLEM OF STATE OF EXCEPTION IN THE LAST DECADE. ON THE ONE HAND, WE WILL USE THE CONCEPTUAL TOOLS OF PHILOSOPHERS SUCH AS GIORGIO AGAMBEN OR ROBERTO ESPOSITO TO PRESENT OUR RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS: IS STATE OF EXCEPTION A STRUCTURAL OR A TEMPORARY NEED OF THE RULE OF LAW STATES? ON THE OTHER HAND, WE WILL INTEND TO ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION THROUGH THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL LITERATURE THAT HAS BEEN POINTING THE RISKS OF PREVENTIVE SOVEREIGN POWER THAT EMERGES IN EXCEPTIONAL TIMES, SINCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DICTATORSHIP TO CURRENT TIMES. OUR THREAD WILL BE THE POLITICAL IDEAL OF PREVENTING WHAT IS UNKNOWN AND UNPREDICTABLE, THE POWER KNOWLEDGE THAT IT GENERATES AND ITS DEMOCRATICAL RISKS. IN THIS SENSE, OUR CONCLUSION WILL DEFEND THAT THE LEGAL ANALYSIS IS UNSATISFACTORY, AS IT DOES NOT ENVISAGES ALL THE NORMATIVE EFFECTS OF NORMALIZATION OF EXCEPTION PROCESS.
720	A QUALITY JUDICIARY IS AN ESSENTIAL INSTITUTION IN EVERY SOCIETY. THE ROLE OF A JUDICIARY IS TO ADJUDICATE THE LAWFUL OUTCOME OF DISPUTES. THE JUDICIARY HAS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING THE CRUCIAL HUMAN RIGHT OF EVERY MEMBER OF A SOCIETY TO BE PROTECTED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE NEED FOR A QUALITY JUDICIARY TO ADHERE TO THE CORE VALUES OF INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIALITY, INTEGRITY, FAIRNESS, TRANSPARENCY AND DILIGENCE. THE AUTHOR ALSO ARGUES THAT THE REAL WORK OR QUALITY OF COURTS CANNOT BE MEASURED BY ARBITRARY BUSINESS TOOLS SUCH AS KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. RATHER, HE MAINTAINS THAT COURTS SHOULD AIM TO DO JUSTICE ACCORDING TO LAW AND MAINTAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. TO DO SO A QUALITY JUDICIARY SHOULD ADAPT ITS PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE TIMES. THE AUTHOR GOES FURTHER TO SUGGEST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE GROWTH OF LITIGATION AND ITS INCREASING COMPLEXITY.
721	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE EXPORT, IMPORT, AND TOTAL TRADE DETERMINANTS USING REDUCED FORM EQUATIONS FOR SIX PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES (PICS) WITH AN INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - AFIXED EFFECTSMODEL, CONTROLLING FORAR(1) ERRORS, USING PANEL DATA FOR SELECTED PICS IS UTILIZED. CONTROLLING FOR COMMON DETERMINANTS OF TRADE, FOUR INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY: GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; RULE OF LAW; REGULATORY QUALITY; AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE TESTED. FINDINGS - THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS INDICATE THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY VARIABLES MATTER FOR IMPROVED LEVELS OF TRADE. THE RESULTS ALSO PROVIDE CONFIRMATION THAT THE APPRECIATION OF CURRENCY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY HARM TRADE; HIGHER LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFUSION ARE VITAL FOR IMPROVED TRADE; AND THAT GRADUAL LIBERALIZATION OF TRADE THROUGH TARIFF REDUCTION STRONGLY FACILITATES MORE TRADE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY CLEARLY POINTS OUT THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE SELECTED COUNTRIES IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF TRADE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER EXPRESSES THE VIEW THAT INSTITUTIONS MATTER FOR ENHANCED TRADE.
722	SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-LEGAL TRANSFORMATIONS SINCE SEPTEMBER 11TH HAVE ATTRACTED SCHOLARLY INVESTIGATIONS IN PURSUIT OF IDENTIFYING THE PRECISE NATURE OF A NEWLY CONFIGURED FORM OF POWER. IN THE COURSE OF SUSPENDING LAW, THE US GOVERNMENT HAS INSTITUTED CONTROVERSIAL TACTICS IN THE WAR ON TERROR, MANY OF WHICH ARE DEEMED ILLEGAL UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW (I.E., THE UNLAWFUL ENEMY COMBATANT DESIGNATION, TORTURE, AND THE WAR IN IRAQ). THIS WORK ATTENDS TO RECENT ANALYSES ON SOVEREIGNTY, GOVERNMENTALITY, COUNTER-LAW, AND STATES OF EXCEPTION IN AN EFFORT TO ELABORATE ON STATE IMPUNITY SINCE IT IS REGARDED AS AN IMPORTANT PHENOMENON WARRANTING GREATER EXPLORATION. DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HOLD SPECIFIC GOVERNMENT ACTORS RESPONSIBLE, KEY COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGIES PERPETUATE SERIOUS STATE CRIMES. THE ARTICLE SITUATES THOSE TRANSGRESSIONS WITHIN A CONCEPTUAL CONTEXT THAT DEEPENS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF POWER IN A POST-9/11 WORLD WHILE INVITING FURTHER CRITIQUE ON THE WAR ON TERROR AS IT UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTIONS.
723	SINGAPORE'S GOVERNING ELITE IS LESS BUREAUCRATIC AND LESS SEPARATED FROM PRIVATE INTERESTS THAN COMMONLY THOUGHT. THE BUREAUCRACY HAS LITTLE INDEPENDENT STRENGTH AND THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IS ENTWINED WITH LEADING MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, PARTICULARLY THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, TO THE POINT THAT THE LINE BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IS FREQUENTLY INDISTINCT. GIVEN THAT DEMOCRATIC OR INTEREST-GROUP CONSTRAINTS ARE MINIMAL, TRANSPARENCY LOW AND THE RULE OF LAW IN DOUBT, WHY SINGAPORE'S ACTIVIST ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE NOT DECAYED INTO A SEARCH FOR PRIVATE REWARDS IS RATHER PUZZLING. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SINGAPORE'S RECORD OF SOUND GOVERNMENT RESTS ON INFORMAL GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS ATTRIBUTES OF THE FORMAL GOVERNMENT SECTOR. THE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ENCOMPASS NOMINALLY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTORS IN A SYSTEMATIZED WAY, STRUCTURING THE INCORPORATION OF PRIVATE ACTORS TO EMBED THE VALUES OF PERFORMANCE-BASED MERIT AND WORKING WITH, NOT AGAINST, GOVERNMENT. THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS, HOWEVER, FRAGILE AND MAY BE SHOWING SIGNS OF DECAY.
724	SINCE THE IRRUPTION OF MARXISM AND ANARCHISM, A CENTURY AND A HALF HAVE PASSED. BUT CAPITALISM HAS SHOWN GREAT RESILIENCE DESPITE SEVERAL MAJOR ECONOMICAL CRISES. IN THIS SCENARIO OF UNFULFILLED PROMISES, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES WHAT REMAINS, IN THE XXI CENTURY, OF THESE LEFT-THE EXTREMIST OR REVOLUTIONATAY ONE-THAT DOES NOT ACCEPT THE PROCEDURES OF THE RULE OF LAW, REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY, OR, SIMPLY, POLITICAL PLURALISM AND THAT, INSTEAD, LEGITIMIZES THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES. TO DO THIS, WE USE CARL SCHMITT'S CONCEPT OF THE POLITICS AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, AND WE EXPOSE THE WAY IN WHICH THAT LEFT CONCEIVES POLITICS, THE RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS ANTAGONISTS ON THE POLITICAL SCENE, THE WAY OF ACCESSING POWER, AS WELL AS SOME RELEVANT BRUSHSTROKES TO THE DEVISED MODEL OF SOCIETY. ALL OF WHICH ALLOWS US TO VERIFY, NOT ONLY THE SURVIVAL OF THESE DISCOURSES, BUT ALSO THE PRESENCE OF MANY ELEMENTS SHARED AMONG ALL OF THEM.
725	THIS COMMENT ON ERMIONI XANTHOPOULOU'S INSIGHTFUL ARTICLE STARTS BY REVISITING THE NATURE AND ROLE OF TRUST IN THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW) PROCEDURE, CONSIDERING THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) (FROM ARANYOSI/CALDARARU TO BIVOLARU/MOLDOVAN). IT IS ARGUED THAT TRUST IS DISTINCT FROM THE PRESUMPTION OF RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT UNDERLIES MUTUAL RECOGNITION. THE EXERCISE OF TRUST IS NOW MONITORED BY THOSE COURTS, AS A MEANS OF PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THIS REHABILITATES THE PROPER MEANING OF TRUST, WHICH CAN BE REINFORCED BY ASSURANCES. PRISON CONDITIONS AND LEGAL CHANGES AFFECTING THE RULE OF LAW ARE ANALYSED IN THIS LIGHT, AS 'DRIVERS OF DISTRUST'. IN SUM, DISTRUST CAN LEGITIMATELY PROVIDE IMMEDIATE PROTECTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THE SPECTRE OF DISTRUST CAUSES THE APPRECIATION OF TRUST, WHICH IN TURN IS BENEFICIAL FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
726	COMPARATIVE ANALYSES ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL- AND STRUCTURAL-LEVEL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT MIGHT NOT BE EVIDENT WHEN EXAMINING THESE INDICATORS IN A SINGLE NATION. IN THIS STUDY, THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUBLIC'S SELF-REPORTED TRUST IN THEPOLICE WERE EXAMINED IN 105 NATIONS. WE ANALYSED THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THREE THEORETICAL PROPOSITIONS: SOCIAL INTEGRATION, DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PERCEPTIONS OF CRIME. WITH RESPECT TO THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS, THE PUBLIC EXPRESSED THE MOST TRUST IN THE POLICE IN NATIONS WITH A GREATER ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A HIGHER PER CAPITA GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. CITIZENS IN COUNTRIES PERCEIVED TO BE MORE CORRUPT WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE THEIR POLICE WERE TRUSTWORTHY. INCONSISTENT WITH EXPECTATIONS, INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL FACTORS, SUCH AS PERCEPTIONS ABOUT CRIME, RISKS OF BEING VICTIMISED, AND PRIOR HISTORIES OF VICTIMISATION ALSO EXERTED AN INFLUENCE ON THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTIONS OF TRUST..
727	THE RISE OF THE OWNERSHIP CONCENTRATION HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLICY QUESTIONS IN THE NEWLY FORMING DEMOCRACIES AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE. THE SO-CALLED OLIGARCHS HAVE ATTRACTED GREAT INTEREST DUE TO THEIR INFLUENCE IN POLICY-MAKING, WHEREBY THEY PURSUED THEIR OWN AGENDA. MUCH LESS SYSTEMATIC ATTENTION HAS BEEN, HOWEVER, DEVOTED TO HOW THEY DO SO. IN THIS ARTICLE, I USE THE CONCEPT OF WEALTH DEFENCE TO SCRUTINIZE THE STRATEGIES OF BULGARIAN OLIGARCHS FOR SECURING THEIR FORTUNE IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1989 AND 1997. THIS ARTICLE REVEALS, CONTRARY TO THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE'S ASSUMPTIONS, THAT IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW WAS LACKING, THE OLIGARCHS DID NOT RESORT PREFERABLY TO AN ACTUAL ASSUMPTION OF POWER BY HOLDING A STATE OFFICE. SINCE THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE WEAK, THEY RE-INSURED THEIR PROPERTY BY EMPLOYING A DIFFERENT SET OF STRATEGIES TO ENSURE RISK DIVERSIFICATION.
728	HOW ARE EXTENSIVE INTERNET CONTROL, SURVEILLANCE AND RESTRICTED ONLINE ANONYMITY RECONCEPTUALIZED INTO VIRTUES OF EFFECTIVE STATE GOVERNANCE, RATHER THAN VIOLATIONS OF CIVIC RIGHTS? THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INSTRUMENTALIZED OSTENSIBLY SOUND LEGITIMATIONS - COUNTERING TERRORIST AND EXTREMIST PROPAGANDA, COMBATTING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY - TO BRING ABOUT A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN INTERNET FREEDOM. WHILE THESE POLICIES HAVE BEEN WIDELY STUDIED, SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINING HOW THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LEGITIMATES AND CULTIVATES POPULAR SUPPORT FOR RESTRICTING ONLINE FREEDOMS REMAINS SCARCE. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE STUDIES HOW RESTRICTIONS OF INTERNET FREEDOM ARE FRAMED IN POLITICAL AND MEDIA DISCOURSES. IT FOCUSES ON THE CASE OF TELEGRAM, A POPULAR MESSAGING APPLICATION THAT WAS BANNED IN RUSSIA IN APRIL 2018 FOR ITS REFUSAL TO PROVIDE THE FSB WITH ACCESS TO ENCRYPTED MESSAGES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION. IT FINDS THAT MEDIA FRAMING OF THE BAN WAS MORE DIVERSE THAN THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENTAL LINE. WHILE NATIONAL SECURITY FRAMING WAS IMPORTANT, THE 'RULE OF LAW' FRAME OCCURRED MOST FREQUENTLY, AND CONSPIRACY FRAMING WAS MARKEDLY INFREQUENT.
729	WHEN WE REFER TO THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF A RIGHT, WE MEAN ANY INALIENABLE UNIVERSAL FREEDOM OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT HAS BEEN WON THROUGH UNINTERRUPTED STRUGGLE AND, IN THEORY, PROTECTED BY INTERNATIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS. THE PHENOMENON OF GLOBAL DEMOGRAPHIC AGING RAISES MULTIPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE EXERCISE OF THE SOCIAL POLICY OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND THROUGH THIS, EXPRESSES THE RESPECTIVE LEVEL OF THE RULE OF LAW. MOREOVER, MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT OR EVEN PREVENT OLDER PEOPLE FROM ENJOYING THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND ACCESSING QUALITY HEALTH SERVICES ARE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO FREELY EXERCISE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS. THEREFORE, IN THIS REVIEW, AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH OF THIS PARTICULAR AGE GROUP OF HEALTH USERS AND ITS PROTECTION AND PROMOTION, AS WELL AS THE ULTIMATE OBLIGATION OF THE STATE TOWARDS ITS REALIZATION.
730	DO MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HAVE SIMILAR ANTICORRUPTION EFFECTS IN OECD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES? DESPITE PROMINENT CAUTIONS AGAINST "NEW ZEALAND" REFORMS WHICH ENHANCE MANAGERIAL DISCRETION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SCHOLARS HAVE NOT ASSESSED THIS QUESTION STATISTICALLY. OUR ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS GAP THROUGH A CONJOINT EXPERIMENT WITH 6,500 PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THREE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND ONE OECD COUNTRY. OUR EXPERIMENT ASSESSES WEBERIAN RELATIVE TO MANAGERIAL APPROACHES TO RECRUITMENT, JOB STABILITY, AND PAY. WE ARGUE THAT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH INSTITUTIONALIZED CORRUPTION AND WEAK RULE OF LAW-YET NOT OECD COUNTRIES WITHOUT SUCH FEATURES-"UNPRINCIPLED" PRINCIPALS USE MANAGERIAL DISCRETION OVER HIRING, FIRING, AND PAY TO FAVOR "UNPRINCIPLED" BUREAUCRATIC AGENTS WHO ENGAGE IN CORRUPTION. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THIS ARGUMENT: MANAGERIAL PRACTICES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER BUREAUCRATIC CORRUPTION IN OUR SURVEYED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, YET HAVE LITTLE EFFECT IN OUR OECD COUNTRY. ALLEGED "BEST PRACTICES" IN PUBLIC MANAGEMENT IN OECD COUNTRIES MAY THUS BE "WORST PRACTICES" IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
731	THIS PAPER PRESENTS AND EVALUATES BROWN'S ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF HATE SPEECH. HIS ANALYSIS IS SEEN AS A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ADEQUATE DEFINITION OF THE TERM HATE SPEECH AS AN ORDINARY CONCEPT, WHICH BROWN UNDERSTANDS AS AN EQUIVOCAL IDIOM AND FAMILY RESEMBLANCE CONCEPT. HOWEVER, AS FAR AS THE CONCEPT OF HATE SPEECH AS A LEGAL TERM IS CONCERNED AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF BROWN'S CONCEPTION ON THE LEGAL REGULATION OF HATE SPEECH IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IT SUGGESTS THAT BROWN'S APPROACH APPEARS PROBLEMATIC. INDEED, IN THE SPHERE OF LEGAL (ESPECIALLY CRIMINAL) REGULATION OF HATE SPEECH THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES TO RESPECT THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, I.E. TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO DEFINE THE TERM HATE SPEECH AS A LEGAL CONCEPT AS UNIVOCALLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT CRIMINAL REGULATION OF HATE SPEECH POSES POTENTIALLY A SERIOUS THREAT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP.
732	THIS ARTICLE USES ROLE THEORY TO STUDY BRITISH MILITARY INTERVENTION IN THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR DURING DAVID CAMERON'S PREMIERSHIP. IT ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND THE CAMERON GOVERNMENT'S LIMITED WILLINGNESS TO USE FORCE (OR WILLINGNESS TO USE LIMITED FORCE) IN THE CONFLICT AS A PRODUCT OF ROLE CONTESTATION IN PARLIAMENT. BY ANALYSING THREE DEBATES PRECEDING VOTES ON MILITARY ACTION IN AUGUST 2013, SEPTEMBER 2014 AND DECEMBER 2015, IT SHOWS HOW MPS DEBATED WHETHER BRITAIN SHOULD PLAY THREE DISTINCT ROLES-OF 'FAITHFUL ALLY', 'RESPONSIBLE GREAT POWER' AND 'RULE OF LAW STATE'-AND DISCUSSED HOW FAR FULFILLING EACH ROLE MEANT BEING WILLING TO INTERVENE MILITARILY. THEIR DISAGREEMENTS, THE ARTICLE ARGUES, UNDERMINED THE COHERENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S PREFERRED STRATEGY, BUT DID SO WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY DELEGITIMISING THE IDEA OF USING FORCE-HENCE ITS CONSTRAINED COMMITMENT TO INTERVENTION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT INVOLVING PARLIAMENT IN DECISIONS ABOUT MILITARY ACTION MAKES IT AN IMPORTANT SITE FOR DOMESTIC ROLE CONTESTATION OF THIS SORT.
733	THE GROWING OPPORTUNITIES OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTION AND ITS SPECIFIC INFLUENCE ON THE PROCESSES OCCURRING AT THE CURRENT STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE CURRENT IMPORTANCE OF THIS STUDY. THIS NECESSITATES AN OBJECTIVE NEED TO EXAMINE THE CONCEPT AND ESSENCE OF WELFARE STATE (SOCIAL STATE), AS WELL AS TO ANALYZE THE CIVIL SOCIETY AS AN ELEMENT INFLUENCING ITS FORMATION, ENSURING THE PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT AND FORMATION OF REAL RULE-OF-LAW DEMOCRATIC STATE. THUS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO STUDY THE CURRENT STATE OF CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTION AND TO JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR ENSURING THE HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL SECURITY FOR ITS CITIZENS, ON THE BASIS OF SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, BUSINESS STRUCTURES AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE MAIN RESEARCH METHODS THAT ENABLED TO COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE THE STUDIED PROBLEM WERE THE ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL AND REGULATORY LEGAL ACTS, STUDY OF THE FOREIGN EXPERIENCE. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF LEGAL REGULATION ANALYSIS AND PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE FORMATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTION IN KAZAKHSTAN.
734	ACCORDING TO UNCERTAINTY MANAGEMENT THEORY (UMT), ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE HELPS INDIVIDUALS TO COPE WITH UNCERTAINTY. EMPLOYEES WILL THUS RESPOND STRONGER TO ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE WHEN UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH. WE CONTRIBUTE TO UMT BY HIGHLIGHTING POOR SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SPECIFICALLY, WEAK RULE OF LAW, LOW HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND HIGH INCOME INEQUALITY, AS SALIENT SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY. WE ARGUE THAT WHEN THESE CONDITIONS ARE UNFAVORABLE, THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE ON EMPLOYEE REACTIONS WILL BE STRONGER THAN WHEN THEY ARE MORE FAVORABLE. WE TEST OUR ARGUMENTS USING A META-ANALYSIS OF 279 STUDIES INVOLVING 315 SAMPLES FROM 31 COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POOR SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS RAISE THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE ON THE ONE HAND AND TASK PERFORMANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIOR ON THE OTHER BUT NOT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORK BEHAVIORS. OUR STUDY RESPONDS TO RECENT CALLS TO PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON CONTEXTUAL FACTORS AND TO CLOSE THE MACRO-MICRO GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE.
735	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AFFECT REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS RECEIVED SUPPORT IN BOTH THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL LITERATURE. GLOBALIZATION HAS ALSO, THOUGH NOT UNANIMOUSLY, BEEN FOUND TO AFFECT GROWTH OUTCOMES. BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO STRANDS OF THE LITERATURE, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EXISTENCE AND STRENGTH OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GLOBALIZATION ON REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH USING A PANEL DATASET COVERING 82 COUNTRIES AND SPANNING 25 YEARS (1986-2010). DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION TECHNIQUES ARE EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY KEY COMPONENTS OF 'INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY': THE RULE OF LAW, CIVIL LIBERTIES AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS REVEAL THAT WHILE 'INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY' ROBUSTLY AND POSITIVELY AFFECTS GROWTH, THE DIRECT EFFECT OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT AND THE INTERACTION EFFECTS, PERHAPS AS A CONSEQUENCE, ARE MUTED OVER THE REVIEW PERIOD. DIRECT AND INTERACTION EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION ON GROWTH ARE, HOWEVER, OBSERVED FOR THE SUB-SAMPLE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
736	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE REVIEW OF LEGALITY IN COMPOSITE PROCEDURES -I.E. EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES WHERE NATIONAL AND EU AUTHORITIES DECIDE JOINTLY. IT EXPLORES HOW EU COURTS DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, IRREGULARITIES OCCURRING AT NATIONAL LEVEL ARE RELEVANT FOR THE LEGALITY OF FINAL DECISIONS ADOPTED AT EU LEVEL. IT PRESENTS TWO CLAIMS: FIRST, THAT EU COURTS HAVE DEVELOPED A DIFFERENTIATED DOCTRINE OF "DERIVATIVE ILLEGALITY", OR "CONTAMINATION EFFECTS" FROM NATIONAL TO EUROPEAN STAGES, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL AT WHICH DISCRETION IS LOCATED. SUCH ILLEGALITY IS CATEGORICALLY EXCLUDED WHERE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES PREDETERMINE THE PROCEDURE'S OUTCOME, AND ADMITTED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHERE THE EU LEVEL ENJOYS DISCRETION TO DIVERGE FROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL. SECOND, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CASE LAW'S REJECTION OR LIMITATION OF DERIVATIVE ILLEGALITY IN COMPOSITE PROCEDURES ALLOWS THE ECJ TO OBSERVE FOUR CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES: THE PROHIBITION OF EU COURTS TO REVIEW NATIONAL MEASURES, THE AUTONOMY AND UNIFORMITY OF EU LEGAL ORDER, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
737	SINCE ESTABLISHING THEIR SELF-PROCLAIMED CALIPHATE IN SYRIA AND IRAQ, ISLAMIC STATE'S COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY HAS PROVED EFFECTIVE IN RECRUITING FOREIGN JIHADIST FIGHTERS AND PEOPLE TO IMMIGRATE TO THE REGION TO LIVE, AS WELL AS RADICALISING PEOPLE WHO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME STATE TO THEIR CAUSE. THIS ARTICLE IS A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE IMPACT THIS STRATEGY HAS HAD ON RUSSIA AND UK AND ANALYSES THE THREAT CASED TO BOTH STATES IN THE RECRUITMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO ISLAMIC STATE'S CAUSE AND HOW THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM AGENCIES CAN COUNTER THIS WITHIN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THEY OPERATE WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE THE POSITIONS OF RUSSIA AND THE UK SINCE THE STATES HAVE DIFFERENT VIEW OVER CONFLICTS IN MIDDLE EAST, BESIDES THAT BRITAIN JOINED THE US' COALITION. RUSSIA HAS GOT A BROADER COUNTER-TERRORISM LEGISLATION THAT IS MORE EFFECTIVE BEING COMPARED TO THE BRITISH ONE. AT THE SAME TIME THE STATES NEED TO COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS AGAINST GLOBAL ISLAM RADICALIZATION.
738	THE RISE OF RIGHTS TALK' IN CHINESE CONTENTIOUS POLITICS ATTRACTS NUMEROUS ATTENTIONS AND DEBATES. DOES IT INDICATE THE RISE OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS CONSCIOUSNESS' AND THE RETREAT OF THE STATE, OR THE CONTINUATION OF THE MASS'S RULES CONSCIOUSNESS' AND THE STATE'S CONTROL? BASED ON A DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF TEXTS DURING A TEN-YEAR STRUGGLE FOR PENSION RIGHTS, I ARGUE THAT THE DISCOURSES USED BY THE PROTESTING WORKERS DEPENDED ON CONCRETE CONTEXTS AND POWER RELATIONS, AND THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN FROM THE STATE PROMOTED THE WORKERS' RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION TO THEIR INTEREST REQUESTS. THE STRATEGIC EMPLOYMENT OF RIGHTS TALK' BY THE WORKERS, ON ONE SIDE, DISPLAYED THE STATE'S SYMBOLIC DOMINATION, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED THE RADICALIZATION OF PROTESTS; ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT SUGGESTED THAT ONLY THROUGH THE REALIZATION OF RULE OF LAW' COULD THE STATE'S MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL CONTENTIONS TURN FROM SHORT TERM CONTAINMENT TO LONG RANGE INSTITUTIONAL ABSORBING.
739	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE VAGUENESS, AND THE INTERPRETATIVE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS (IIAS) AND DEVELOPS A NEW NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING THESE TREATIES. IT FOCUSES ON THE HISTORICAL EMBEDDING OF INVESTMENT PROTECTION AS A MEANS OF FACILITATING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS UPON ITS SYNTHETIC PUBLIC LAW NATURE. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT A TELEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO INTERPRETATION IMPOSES BOUNDARIES ON THE MEANING OF SUBSTANTIVE IIA PROVISIONS. THE ARTICLE THEN ELABORATES HOW THE TRANSNATIONAL DIMENSION OF IIAS PROVIDES A BENCHMARK, WHICH IS THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION OFFERED TO ECONOMIC ACTORS AGAINST INTERFERENCE BY THE STATE IN COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. THE ARTICLE THEN SHOWS HOW THE RESULTING CHALLENGES OF COMPARATIVE PUBLIC LAW COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE METHODOLOGY OF RE- AND PRE-STATEMENT OF TRANSNATIONAL UNIFORM PRINCIPLES': SOPHISTICATED AND DETAILED RULES STRIKING THE PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVATE ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND THE PUBLIC REGULATORY INTEREST, SO AS TO PROVIDE MORE LEGAL CERTAINTY FOR BOTH INVESTORS AND HOST STATES.
740	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE COUNTRY-LEVEL DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUDIT PROFESSION IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES AND WHETHER THIS DEVELOPMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH AUDIT QUALITY AND AUDITOR CHOICE. I FIND THAT AUDIT QUALITY IS HIGHER FOR CLIENT COMPANIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WITH A MORE DEVELOPED AUDIT PROFESSION, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR RULE OF LAW AND INVESTOR PROTECTION. SPECIFICALLY, BIG 4 CLIENT COMPANIES' TOTAL AND ABNORMAL ACCRUALS ARE BOTH LOWER, AND EARNINGS ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER AUDIT PROFESSION DEVELOPMENT (APD). HOWEVER, THESE RESULTS HOLD ONLY FOR COMPANIES AUDITED BY A BIG 4 AUDITOR. RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT STRONGER APD IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER LIKELIHOOD THAT A CLIENT COMPANY HIRES A BIG 4 AUDITOR. MY FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE THAT EXPLORES DIFFERENCES IN AUDIT QUALITY AND DETERMINANTS OF AUDITOR CHOICE, THE LITERATURE THAT EXPLORES CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES IN AUDIT PROFESSIONS, AND RESEARCH ON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AUDIT INSTITUTIONS IN EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES.
741	THE ARTICLE CONCENTRATES ON THE CORE ISSUE OF WALTHER SCHUCKING'S SCIENTIFIC EFFORTS AND HIS LITERARY PRODUCTION AS A PUBLICIST - THE IDEA OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. IT BEGINS BY SITUATING SCHUCKING'S METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH, NOTABLY HIS DESIRE TO MOVE BEYOND LEGAL POSITIVISM, BEFORE MOVING ON TO ANALYSE SCHUCKING'S SPECIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE NOTION OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION. SCHUCKING ARGUED THAT THE GENERAL MOTTO 'PEACE THROUGH LAW' SHOULD BE ATTAINED BY A 'REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION' OF THE WORLD AND STATED THAT A RELEVANT TREND TOWARDS A TRUE RULE OF LAW ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WAS ALREADY ON ITS WAY. IN FACT, SCHUCKING WENT EVEN FURTHER AND POSTULATED A WORLD CONFEDERATION 'WELTSTAATENBUND' AS THE CENTREPIECE OF THE REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE KEY FOR THE REALIZATION OF ALL FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE FIELD. HAVING ASSESSED FEATURES OF SCHUCKING'S REFORM PROGRAMME, WHICH HE PUT FORWARD WITH CONSIDERABLE CONSISTENCY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SCHUCKING IS RIGHTLY SEEN AS A PIONEER WHO BROKE NEW GROUND IN ANALYSING THE PHENOMENON OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION.
742	THIS ARTICLE TRACES A CIVIL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUIT FROM DISPUTE TO DECISION TO EXPLORE HOW ENVIRONMENTAL LAW WORKS, AS WELL AS HOW LAWYERS AND LITIGANTS TRY TO WORK THE LAW. DETAILING GROUND-LEVEL ENCOUNTERS WITH A LEGAL SYSTEM PROMOTED AND CAREFULLY WATCHED BY POLITICAL ELITES OFFERS A FRESH PERSPECTIVE ON THE WAYS THE PAST 30 YEARS OF LEGAL REFORMS HAVE AFFECTED THE EXPERIENCE OF CHINA'S COURT USERS. AMID ACCOUNTS OF FINANCIAL STRESS, LAWYER CLIENT TENSIONS AND THE HUNT FOR ELITE ALLIES, WHAT EMERGES IS A STORY OF VARIATION. ALTHOUGH PLAINTIFFS AND LAWYERS AGREE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CASES ARE HARD AND WRINGING CONCESSIONS OUT OF POLLUTERS REQUIRES REMARKABLE PERSISTENCE, THE PROCESS SOMETIMES CREAKS FORWARD SO THAT APPRAISALS ARE CONDUCTED ON TIME, HELP IS SOLICITED AND COMPENSATION WON. HOW CHINESE COURTS WORK (AND HOW WELL THEY WORK) DEPENDS ON LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AN INSIGHT THAT SUGGESTS THAT DISAGGREGATING EXPANSIVE CONCEPTS LIKE RULE OF LAW IS A HELPFUL WAY TO EXPLORE COMPLEXITY INSTEAD OF GLOSSING OVER IT.
743	ARE NATURAL RESOURCES A "CURSE" OR A "BLESSING"? THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EITHER OUTCOME IS POSSIBLE. THIS PAPER SURVEYS A VARIETY OF HYPOTHESES AND SUPPORTING EVIDENCE FOR WHY SOME COUNTRIES BENEFIT AND OTHERS LOSE FROM THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THESE INCLUDE THAT A RESOURCE BONANZA INDUCES APPRECIATION OF THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE, DEINDUSTRIALIZATION, AND BAD GROWTH PROSPECTS, AND THAT THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE MORE SEVERE IN VOLATILE COUNTRIES WITH BAD INSTITUTIONS AND LACK OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRACIES, AND UNDERDEVELOPED FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. ANOTHER HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A RESOURCE BOOM REINFORCES RENT GRABBING AND CIVIL CONFLICT ESPECIALLY IF INSTITUTIONS ARE BAD, INDUCES CORRUPTION ESPECIALLY IN NONDEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, AND KEEPS IN PLACE BAD POLICIES. FINALLY, RESOURCE RICH DEVELOPING ECONOMIES SEEM UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CONVERT THEIR DEPLETING EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCES INTO OTHER PRODUCTIVE ASSETS. THE SURVEY ALSO OFFERS SOME WELFARE-BASED FISCAL RULES FOR HARNESSING RESOURCE WINDFALLS IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. (JEL O47, Q32, Q33)
744	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF DEFERENCE IN CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES IN THE CONTEXT OF MINORITY RIGHTS CLAIMS. IT REVIEWS PREVAILING JUSTIFICATIONS AGAINST JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, ARGUING THAT CONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE EXISTENCE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR INCLUSIVE GOVERNANCE ARE KEY TO DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ROLE AND INDEED, DUTY OF THE COURT. PARTING COMPANY WITH THE COURT'S EMPHASIS ON DEFERENCE AND SOCIAL CONSENSUS IN W V REGISTRAR OF MARRIAGES, IT ARGUES THAT COURTS HAVE AN ELEVATED RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE INTERPRETIVE ISSUES ON SUBSTANTIAL GROUNDS BASED ON PRINCIPLE OR META-PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN STRUCTURAL GROUNDS LIKE DEFERRAL TO MAJORITY VIEWS IN MINORITY RIGHTS CLAIMS. THIS IMPOSES A GREATER BURDEN ON THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO SERVE AS A CONDUIT FOR MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN CONTENTIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AND MORE BROADLY AS A FORUM FOR DELIBERATIVE PARTICIPATION BY MARGINALISED COMMUNITIES. WHILST IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE SAFEGUARDS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES BE RIGOROUSLY OBSERVED, A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF SCRUTINY IN SUCH INSTANCES COMPLEMENTS, RATHER THAN UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW.
745	THE PAPER EXPLORES THE ROLE OF JACQUES LACAN'S ETHICS OF PSYCHOANALYSIS IN DEBATES IN LAW AND LEGAL PHILOSOPHY. IT PROCEEDS BY CONSIDERING A DEBATE BETWEEN SLAVOJ ZIZEK AND JUDITH BUTLER OVER LACAN'S CONCEPT OF THE REAL, WHICH FORMS PART OF A LARGER DISCUSSION OVER THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW (BUTLER ET AL. 2000). THROUGH REFERENCE TO DISCUSSIONS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND ETHICS BASED ON THE ANTIGONE TRAGEDY, I ARGUE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ZIZEK AND BUTLER'S POSITIONS SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE CORRECTNESS OF THEIR READING OF LACAN, BUT IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL COMMITMENTS THAT INFORM THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS. I EXPLAIN THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS DEBATE OVER ONE OF LACAN'S MOST ENIGMATIC CONCEPTS, THEREBY SHOWING HOW LACAN'S THEORY CAN BE USED TO RETHINK THE POLITICS OF LAW IN LIGHT OF THE INCREASED EMPHASIS ON ETHICS IN CONTEMPORARY LEGAL DEBATES.
746	IT HAS BEEN WIDELY ARGUED THAT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS NECESSARY FOR PEACE AND SECURITY AND THAT IT PROMOTES RECONCILIATION. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW ATTEMPTS TO EXAMINE THESE CLAIMS WITH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR FORMER YUGOSLAVIA ON POLITICAL THINKING AND BEHAVIOR IN SERBIA. IT FINDS THAT THE ICTY HAS HAD THUS FAR LITTLE DIRECT IMPACT ON SERB LEADERS AND POLITICAL PARTIES, THE RULE OF LAW, OR CIVIC SOCIETY. WHAT IMPACT THE COURT HAS HAD HAS BEEN INDIRECT, THE PRODUCT OF A NETWORK OF OTHER ACTORS LIKE THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. THESE NETWORK MEMBERS MAKE REFERENCE TO THE ICTY AS THEY TRY TO MANAGE BALKAN POLITICS. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT WHILE INTERNATIONALIZED CRIMINAL COURTS MAY PUNISH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND DEVELOP LEGAL NORMS AND PROCEDURES, "JUDICIAL SHOCK THERAPY" IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. THE ICTY HAS NOT YET PUSHED SERBIA IN A MORE LIBERAL POLITICAL DIRECTION, WHICH IS A FOUNDATION FOR PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN THE BALKANS.
747	KHATAMI WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN IN 1997. HE CAME TO POWER WITH THE PROMISE OF CREATING AN ISLAMIC CIVIL SOCIETY AND BRINGING ABOUT POLITICAL REFORM, RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM, AND RELIGIOUS DEMOCRACY. HE ADVOCATED SUCH VALUES AS TOLERANCE, MODERATION, RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY, AND DIALOGUE AT THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ARENAS. KHATAMI ASSIGNED SCHOOLS THE TASK OF CREATING PIOUS, MORAL, POLITICISED, AND EMPOWERED INDIVIDUALS WITH A STRONG IRANIAN-ISLAMIC IDENTITY, CAPABLE OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WEST. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE PILLARS OF KHATAMI'S THOUGHTS AND ASSESS WHETHER HIS REFORMIST AGENDA IS REFLECTED IN FORMAL SCHOOLING. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PREVAILING EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND VALUES ILLUSTRATES THAT ALTHOUGH SOME OF KHATAMI'S IDEALS ARE REFLECTED, SCHOOLS ARE STILL PAROCHIAL, SEPARATING 'US' FROM 'THEM', WITH NO ATTEMPT TO PREPARE THE YOUNG FOR GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP. IRANIAN SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO REMAIN BASTIONS OF CONSERVATISM AND IDEOLOGY.
748	THE PAPER DESCRIBES HOW NGOS, LAWYERS' ASSOCIATIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY REACTED TO THE SUICIDE OF A YOUNG MAN FROM GUINEA WHILE DETAINED IN TURIN'S PRE-REMOVAL DETENTION CENTRE (CPR), WHERE MIGRANTS ARE DETAINED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF DEPORTATION. DEPRIVATION OF FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY CRIMINAL RECORD ENTAILS A LEGAL SCANDAL, SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGES THE RULE OF LAW: THE LIMITATION OF FREEDOM IS RESERVED TO NON-EU CITIZENS WHO NOW COME UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF LAY JUDGES (JUSTICE OF THE PEACE), DESPITE DECISIONS ON PERSONAL FREEDOM ARE EXCLUSIVELY HANDLED BY FULL PROFESSIONAL JUDGES. FURTHERMORE, THE LEGAL GROUND FOR THE DETENTION OF UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS IS SURPRISINGLY FRAGILE AND FRAGMENTARY, OFTEN RESORTING TO MERE MINISTERIAL CIRCULARS WHERE A LAW SHOULD BE MANDATORY. DEFYING ALMOST 25 YEARS OF INDIFFERENCE, SILENT ACCEPTANCE AND IGNORANCE, THE NETWORK OF ACTIVISTS LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO SHUT THE CPR DOWN, PUBLISHING THE BLACK BOOK ON TURIN'S CPR AND RAISING THE PUBLIC ATTENTION AGAINST THE SEGREGATION OF MIGRANTS THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES.
749	WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER BANKS USE LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS TO SMOOTH INCOME AND WHETHER THIS BEHAVIOUR IS INFLUENCED BY FOREIGN BANK PRESENCE, OWNERSHIP AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DIFFERENCES ACROSS AFRICAN COUNTRIES. WE EXAMINE 370 BANKS FROM 21 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2021. WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT AFRICAN BANKS USE LLPS TO SMOOTH THEIR INCOME WHEN THEY ARE MORE PROFITABLE DURING ECONOMIC BOOM OR RECESSION. INCOME SMOOTHING IS PERSISTENT (I) AMONG BANKS WITH A WIDELY DISPERSED OWNERSHIP, (II) AMONG BANKS WITH STRONG GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP AND (III) AMONG BANKS WITH WEAK GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP. INCOME SMOOTHING IS ALSO PERSISTENT IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GREATER CORRUPTION CONTROL, BETTER REGULATORY QUALITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY. IN CONTRAST, MODERATE CONCENTRATED OWNERSHIP REDUCES BANK INCOME SMOOTHING. BANK INCOME SMOOTHING IS ALSO REDUCED IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE STRONG RULE OF LAW, HIGH GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, STRONG FOREIGN BANK PRESENCE AND STRONG VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT EFFECTIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CAN CONSTRAIN THE EXTENT OF INCOME SMOOTHING BY AFRICAN BANKS.
750	THE EARLY PHASE OF ZYGMUNT ZIEMBI & NACUTE;SKI'S THEORY OF LAW INTERPRETATION WAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE LATE 1950S AND EARLY 1970S. FROM THE VERY OUTSET, VALUES WOULD FEATURE PERMANENTLY IN THE THEORY AS COMPONENTS OF THE AXIOLOGICAL SYSTEM OF THE LEGISLATOR. CERTAIN VALUES, SUCH AS LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LAW AND SOCIAL LIFE, BECAME CENTRAL TO TWO INTERPRETATIONS: STATIC AND DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION, RESPECTIVELY. ZIEMBI & NACUTE;SKI WAS THE FIRST POLISH LEGAL THEORIST TO DEFINE FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION AS A PARADIGM THAT INVOKES THE LEGISLATOR'S VALUES. AS HE ARGUED, TWO TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION: ANALOGIA LEGIS OR EXTENSIVE INTERPRETATION HAVE THEIR EFFECT ANCHORED IN THE ADOPTED VALUES, THUS PREVENTING CASES WHICH HAPPEN TO BE STRONGLY JUSTIFIED AXIOLOGICALLY BY SUCH VALUES FROM BEING EXCLUDED FROM REGULATION. VALUES ALSO ENABLE IDENTIFICATION OF THE NORMS -CONCLUSIONS DERIVED THROUGH ANALOGIA JURIS AND ARGUMENTA A FORTIORI . BY PROVIDING GROUNDS FOR THE POSTULATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, VALUES ULTIMATELY SAFEGUARD THE LEGAL SYSTEM FROM ABUSE.
751	SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE POLITICALLY FRACTURED LANDSCAPE OF MEDIEVAL WESTERN EUROPE WAS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE EVOLUTION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW. IN MAKING THIS ARGUMENT, SALTER AND YOUNG (2019) HAVE RECENTLY EMPHASIZED THAT THE CONSTELLATION OF POLITICAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES WAS POLYCENTRIC AND HIERARCHICAL; HOLDERS OF THOSE RIGHTS WERE RESIDUAL CLAIMANTS TO THE RETURNS ON THEIR GOVERNANCE AND SOVEREIGN. THE LATTER CHARACTERISTICS-RESIDUAL CLAIMANCY AND SOVEREIGNTY-IMPLY A CLEAR DELINEATION OF JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES AND THEIR INTEGRITY. HOWEVER, HISTORIANS' DESCRIPTION OF THE "FEUDAL ANARCHY" THAT FOLLOWED THE TENTH-CENTURY DISINTEGRATION OF THE CAROLINGIAN EMPIRE DOES NOT SUGGEST CLEARLY DELINEATED AND STABLE BOUNDARIES. IN THIS PAPER, I HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF THE PEACE OF GOD MOVEMENT IN THE 11TH AND 12TH CENTURIES IN DELINEATING AND STABILIZING THE STRUCTURE OF POLITICAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL POLITICAL ECONOMY, THE PEACE OF GOD MOVEMENT PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN THE EARLY MEDIEVAL ERA AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES.
752	ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE GREATLY INFLUENCED THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND NEW PARADIGMS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED ACCORDINGLY. GOVERNANCE, ONE OF THESE APPROACHES, DEALS WITH CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES SUCH AS CHANGING THE STATE-CITIZEN RELATIONSHIP, STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY, IMPROVING THE SERVICE PROVISION CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND ARE DISCUSSED AT GLOBAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS STUDY, THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON DEMOCRACY IS INVESTIGATED. ACCORDINGLY, THE THEORETICAL CLAIM THAT GOVERNANCE HAS AN IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY IS TESTED WITH AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS USING QUANTITATIVE DATA. IN ORDER TO TEST THIS CLAIM, DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE INDICES ARE ANALYSED STATISTICALLY. BASED ON THESE DATA, VARIOUS CORRELATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSES CAN BE MADE. AS A RESULT, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT GOVERNANCE HAS A VERY HIGH EFFECT ON DEMOCRACY. MOREOVER, THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF CORRELATION AND EFFECT BETWEEN THE SUB-DIMENSIONS OF BOTH INDICES.
753	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF REMITTANCE INFLOWS ON DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE ALSO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN ENHANCING REMITTANCES' EFFECT IN REDUCING DEFORESTATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT OVERALL REMITTANCES REDUCE DEFORESTATION. WE SHOW THAT REMITTANCES' REDUCTION EFFECT ON DEFORESTATION IS GREATER IN MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES THAN IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. CONSIDERING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE, AND IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW ACT TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION. MOREOVER, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ENHANCES THE IMPACT OF REMITTANCES ON REDUCING DEFORESTATION IN THE ENTIRE SAMPLE AND IN MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST, IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY DOES NOT COMPLEMENT REMITTANCES TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT, TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION RATES, THE FOCUS SHOULD NOT ONLY BE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BUT TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT, ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. (C) 2019 UNIVERSITY OF VENICE.

754	DURING AND AFTER THE EUROMAIDAN, THE UKRAINIAN SOCIETY EXPERIENCED AN EMERGENCE OF NON-STATE GROUPS THAT COMBINED ELEMENTS OF CIVIC ACTIVISM AND PARAMILITARISM. THEY OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE STATE AND OFTEN USED EXTRA-LEGAL VIOLENCE TO RESTORE LAW AND ORDER, DELIVER JUSTICE, AND PROTECT UKRAINE FROM EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREATS. THEIR CONDUCT CLOSELY RESEMBLES VIGILANTISM. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE BODY OF CRIMINOLOGICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON VIGILANTISM IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE DIVERSE LANDSCAPE OF VIGILANTE GROUPS IN POST-EUROMAIDAN UKRAINE. IT EXPLORES THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE VIGILANTE GROUPS, THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT, AND THE POLITICAL AND BUSINESS ELITES; ANALYZES THE LEGAL BOUNDARIES OF VIGILANTISM IN UKRAINE; AND DISCUSSES THE OUTCOMES OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE FOR DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW PARADIGM FOR THEORIZING POPULAR MOBILIZATION IN UKRAINE AND SHEDS LIGHT ON IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS OF THE FORMATION OF AN INFORMAL SYSTEM OF POLICING AND JUSTICE.
755	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW AN ILLIBERAL REGIME WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CAN HINDER THE MOBILIZATION OF CITIZENS AND CIVIL ACTORS BY CREATING AN ATMOSPHERE OF "AMBIGUITY". IN OUR ANALYSIS, WE FIRST DISCUSS THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTION OF 2011, WHICH PROVIDES THE DRIVING FORCE OF THE REGIME, AND NEXT USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE MIGRATION CRISIS SHOW HOW THIS ATMOSPHERE OF AMBIGUITY IS CREATED. WE ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE PRESENT, OPPONENTS OF THE REGIME ARE DISHEARTENED TO ACT BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE RELYING ON THE LOGIC OF CONSTITUTIONAL OTHERING, DIVIDING THE WORLD INTO ITS ENEMIES AND FRIENDS AND SHIFTING FROM THE RULE OF LAW TO RULING BY LAW. WHILE THE REGIME'S GAUDY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST IMMIGRANTS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS), THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY, THE EU OR GEORGE SOROS ARE OMNIPRESENT, WE AIM TO GO DEEPER AND HIGHLIGHT THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THE REGIME MANAGES TO DISCOURAGE CITIZENS FROM VOICING THEIR DISCONTENT.
756	IN A CONTEXT OF VARIOUS CRISES IN THE COUNTRY (POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, ETHICAL, LEGAL), THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PRESENT A SPECIFIC, THAT OF TAX FORECLOSURES, WHICH IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND CAN EXEMPLIFY THE OTHERS. HERE IT IS ARGUED THAT A PART OF IT COME FROM A STRATEGY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES TO EXTEND INDEFINITELY SUCH JUDICIAL ACTIONS, ALTHOUGH CONTRARY TO CLEAR LEGAL PRECEPTS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS ARE NOT FAVORABLE EVEN FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW. TO DEVELOP THAT ARGUMENT, IT WAS SOUGHT TO USE TRADITIONAL BUT INTERDISCIPLINARY DOGMATIC SOURCES, CREATING THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT TO STUDY LEGISLATION AND JURISPRUDENCE OF REGENCY, NOTABLY A RELEVANT DECISION OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE. IN IT, PREVIOUS PARAMETERS HAVE ABRUPTLY CEASED TO BE APPLIED, WHICH IS TYPICAL OF A TROUBLED TIME. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, IT WAS IDENTIFIED HOW THE ATTORNEYSIN-FACT, AS PUBLIC ADVOCATES, CAN BE FUNDAMENTAL IN OVERCOMING THE CRISIS. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THE STRATEGY OF GIVING GREATER LEGAL SECURITY, VALUING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
757	THERE IS A GROWING LITERATURE CRITIQUING THE UNREFLECTIVE APPLICATION OF BIG DATA, PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND MACHINE-LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS. SUCH METHODS MAY REFLECT BIASES RATHER THAN REASONED DECISION MAKING. THEY ALSO MAY LEAVE THOSE AFFECTED BY AUTOMATED SORTING AND CATEGORIZING UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIS OF THE DECISIONS AFFECTING THEM. DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS, MACHINE-LEARNING EXPERTS ARE FEEDING JUDICIAL OPINIONS TO ALGORITHMS TO PREDICT HOW FUTURE CASES WILL BE DECIDED. WE CALL THE USE OF SUCH PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN JUDICIAL CONTEXTS A JURISPRUDENCE OF BEHAVIOURISM AS IT RESTS ON A FUNDAMENTALLY SKINNERIAN MODEL OF COGNITION AS A BLACK-BOXED TRANSFORMATION OF INPUTS INTO OUTPUTS. IN THIS MODEL, PERSUASION IS PASSE; WHAT MATTERS IS PREDICTION. AFTER DESCRIBING AND CRITIQUING A RECENT STUDY THAT HAS ADVANCED THIS JURISPRUDENCE OF BEHAVIOURISM, WE QUESTION THE VALUE OF SUCH RESEARCH. WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT OF PREDICTION MODELS NOT BASED ON THE MEANING OF IMPORTANT PRECEDENTS AND FACTS MAY ENDANGER THE CORE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES.
758	CONSIDERING THE HIGH NUMBER OF EX-CONVICTS IN BRAZIL AND THE NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES THEY FACE IN THE PROCESS OF RESOCIALIZATION, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THIS AREA, SEEKING TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THERE IS A LEGAL DUTY IN THE BRAZILIAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC POLICIES AIMED AT REINTEGRATING SUCH INDIVIDUALS INTO THE LABOR MARKET. AFTER ANALYZING THE RELEVANCE OF THE EXERCISE OF THE WORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESOCIALIZATION, AS WELL AS ITS CONNECTION WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT INTEGRATE THE ESSENTIAL CORE OF THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONSTITUTION, BY INSTITUTING A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW THROUGHOUT MULTIPLE NORMATIVE PROVISIONS, CONFERRED A DUTY OF SOCIAL INCLUSION TO THE BRAZILIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, IMPOSING ON IT THE OBLIGATION OF ADOPTING PUBLIC POLICIES THAT INCREASE THE ACCESS OF THE EX-CONVICTS TO THE LABOR MARKET, CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR SOCIAL REINTEGRATION.
759	WHILE CLAIMS ABOUND REGARDING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE'S IMPORTANCE FOR DEMOCRACY BUILDING IN TRANSITIONING COUNTRIES, EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATIONS OF THESE REMAIN LIMITED OR HAVE PRODUCED CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE DEBATES BY INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION BUILDING IN UGANDA - LOOKING IN PARTICULAR AT THE RULE OF LAW, THE SECURITY FORCES AND PARTICIPATION. IT DOES SO BY EXPLORING THE CAUSAL MECHANISMS LINKING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE TO DEMOCRACY, THAT IS, THE MEANS THROUGH WHICH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE EXERTS ITS IMPACT. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS WIDELY EXPECTED TO IMPACT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION BUILDING THROUGH THREE MECHANISMS: (DE)LEGITIMATION, REFORM, AND EMPOWERMENT. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT IN UGANDA, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE'S IMPACT THROUGH THESE IS MORE CIRCUMSCRIBED THAN HAS SO FAR BEEN ASSUMED, AND THAT IT SOMETIMES IMPACTS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION BUILDING NEGATIVELY. THE UGANDAN EXPERIENCE FURTHERMORE SUGGESTS THAT IN CONTEXTS OF ARMED CONFLICT AND A HYBRID REGIME, EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CAN SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION BUILDING SHOULD BE LOWERED.
760	A STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE PRESENCE OF FUNCTIONING EQUITY MARKETS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF AN ADVANCED MARKET-BASED FINANCIAL SYSTEM. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT EQUITY MARKETS FUNCTION MORE EFFICIENTLY IN THE PRESENCE OF SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. BUT HOW DO THESE TWO ASPECTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT INTERACT? THAT IS, DOES THE PERFORMANCE OF A STOCK EXCHANGE SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR CAN IT ACTUALLY HINDER IT? EXAMINING MONTHLY DATA FOR 21 TRANSITION ECONOMIES OVER A SHIFTING MONTHLY WINDOW FROM 1989 TO 2012, AND USING A FIXED-EFFECTS SPECIFICATION WITH DRISCOLL-KRAAY STANDARD ERRORS, I FIND SUPPORT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROPERTY RIGHTS AND STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. WHILE A WELL-FUNCTIONING STOCK MARKET MAY HELP REINFORCE PROPERTY RIGHTS THROUGH DEMONSTRATION EFFECTS, A STOCK MARKET THAT HAS BECOME "TOO SUCCESSFUL" MAY ENTRENCH INTERESTS AND LEAD TO PROPERTY RIGHTS-ERODING POLICIES.
761	THE WORK OF THE MARTYROLOGIST JOHN FOXE ENSURES THAT THE BURNINGS DOMINATE MODERN ACCOUNTS OF THE CAMPAIGN WAGED AGAIN PROTESTANTISM IN THE REIGN OF MARY I (1553-8). DRAWING ON OTHER SOURCES, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY, A LESS NOTICED BUT MORE COMMON PENALTY IMPOSED UPON PROTESTANTS. IT DESCRIBES THE TYPES OF FORFEITURE THAT OCCURRED AND ANALYSES THEIR LEGAL BASIS; IT CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE PENALTY AND HIGHLIGHTS MEANS OF EVASION. BY EXAMINING FORFEITURE, THE ARTICLE EXTENDS AND ENHANCES THE DEBATE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MARIAN RELIGIOUS POLICY AND ABOUT THE DEGREE OF SUPPORT THAT THE REGIME COULD COMMAND. FORFEITURE, IT IS SHOWN, COULD BE A POWERFUL FORM OF COERCION, BUT DEPENDED UPON POPULAR POLITICS TO BE EFFECTIVE. SUBSEQUENT EFFORTS IN ELIZABETH I'S REIGN TO OBTAIN RESTITUTION SUBSTANTIATE THE ARTICLE'S THESIS THAT A DEEP-ROOTED BELIEF IN THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRAINED THE PENAL RELIGIOUS POLICIES OF EARLY MODERN ENGLAND.
762	THE HLA HART MEMORIAL LECTURE, DELIVERED AT OXFORD ON 24 MAY 2016. THE LECTURE CONSIDERS HOW THE ADVENT AND GROWTH OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY IS POSING CHALLENGES FOR THE TRADITIONAL THEORIES OF CONTRACT, AND FOR THE DUTIES OF THE STATE WITH REGARD TO CONTRACTUAL ORDERING. IN PARTICULAR, THE LECTURE CONSIDERS THE LACK OF 'FIT' BETWEEN CERTAIN PREVALENT
763	THE 5000-YEARS UNINTERRUPTED CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE EMBODIES THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL WISDOM OF THE CHINESE NATION AND IS A SOURCE OF PRIDE FOR THE CHINESE NATION. IT HAS PROVIDED EXTREMELY RICH RESOURCES AND TREASURES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IT HAS BEEN INHERITED VERTICALLY, EVOLVED INTERGENERATIONALLY AND RESERVED CONTINUOUSLY. ORIGINATING FROM BOTH THE HISTORICAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND FROM MARXIST HISTORICAL MATERIALISM, THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS PROFOUNDLY INFLUENCED NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. THE COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNANCE OF POLITICS, LAW, AND MORALITY IN ANCIENT CHINA, AS REFLECTED IN THE RITES OF ZHOU, A BOOK OF THE WESTERN ZHOU DYNASTY (1027-771 BC) ON CULTURAL IDEOLOGY AND POLITICAL STRUCTURE, PROVIDES AN EARLY WORK ON THE GOVERNANCE OF ANCIENT CHINA. CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE HAS REMAINED PROGRESSIVE, AND WITH THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE NATION, IT IS NOW IMPORTANT TO PROMOTE CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW ERA.
764	IN SOME MEMBER STATES, DOCTRINE AND CASE LAW OF NATIONAL COURTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THAT, UNDER CURRENTLY APPLICABLE EUROPEAN ELECTORAL LAW, ELECTIONS TO THE EP ARE OF A SECOND-ORDER, WHEREBY EUROPEAN ISSUES GIVE WAY TO PURELY DOMESTIC ONES. IN ANY EVENT, THIS DOES NOT HINDER THE POSITION OF THE EP AS A GENUINE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER, WHICH, ABOVE ALL, DEMANDS EFFECTS FROM ELECTORAL LAW THAT IT CANNOT PROVIDE, SINCE THE INTENSITY WITH WHICH AN ELECTION IS EXPERIENCED DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES EXTERNAL TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF. WHAT ELECTORAL LAW CAN GUARANTEE INSTEAD IS THE PERIODIC HOLDING OF FREE ELECTIONS. AND THAT REQUIRES ENSURING THAT THE EP IS APPOINTED BY THE FREE EXPRESSION OF THE OPINION OF ALL (AND ONLY) EUROPEAN CITIZENS; THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE VOTE IS DETERMINED BY RATIONAL CRITERIA; THAT THE ELECTORAL FORMULA ALLOWS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL CURRENTS; AND THAT THE "RULE OF LAW" IS RESPECTED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.
765	DISPOSSESSED OF HIS CHAIR, BANNED FROM SCIENTIFIC AND ACADEMIC ARENAS AND UNABLE TO TOLERATE "THE REDUCTION TO A CASTE OF PARIAHS", GINO FANO LEFT TURIN FOR SWITZERLAND IN 1938, SETTLING IN LAUSANNE. HE WOULD REMAIN THERE UNTIL 1945, ENGAGING IN THREE AREAS: SOLIDARITY, TEACHING IN THE COURSES ORGANIZED FOR ITALIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS INTERNED IN THE LAUSANNE AND HUTTWIL CAMPS; AND DISSEMINATION, THROUGH A SERIES OF CONFERENCES ON ITALIAN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY THAT HE HELD AT THE CERCLE MATHEMATIQUE. IN THIS PAPER WE WILL FOCUS ON THE SWISS PERIOD OF FANO'S PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL TRAJECTORY, SEVEN YEARS GENERALLY DISMISSED AS THE UNPLEASANT AND UNJUST EPILOGUE OF A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SCIENTIFIC LIFE, AND THAT BY CONTRAST ARE NOT, IN THE MEASURE THAT THEY RETURN A BROADER NARRATIVE: THAT OF JEWISH SCHOLARS, TRAINED IN THE BELLE EPOQUE OF SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONALISM, WHO SAW THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW DENIED BY RACE THEORIES, AND WHO WITNESSED THE PERVERSION OF COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCES UNDER TOTALITARIAN REGIMES.
766	HOW DO CORRUPT PRACTICES EVOLVE INTO THE ALMOST COMPLETE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE STATE, AND WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR A MAFIA STATE TO EMERGE? IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TRACE VENEZUELA'S POLITICAL TRAJECTORY UNDER PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ AND ITS CAUSAL CONNECTION TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF A MAFIA STATE UNDER PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO BY IDENTIFYING CRITICAL JUNCTURES THAT OCCURRED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIONS OF PRESIDENTS CHAVEZ AND MADURO. THESE CRITICAL JUNCTURES FIRST LAID THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE MAFIA STATE, ALBEIT UNINTENTIONALLY, AND THEN ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE STATE. THE INCREMENTAL ABOLITION OF GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS STARTED BY CHAVEZ AND CONTINUED BY MADURO IN THE CONTEXT OF DRAMATIC DECLINE IN OIL PRODUCTION CREATED AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES COULD THRIVE. BY THE END OF THIS PROCESS, VENEZUELA HAD EVOLVED INTO A COMPLEX KLEPTOCRACY IN WHICH NO RULE OF LAW OR INSTITUTIONS WERE CAPABLE OF OR WILLING TO OPPOSE THE EXECUTIVE AND ITS LOYAL MILITARY AND IRREGULAR FORCE ALLIES. THUS, A MAFIA STATE IS BORN.
767	THIS CONTRIBUTION DISCUSSES SPECIAL SECTORAL TAXES AND ANALYSES THE CJEU JUDGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ON THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EU LAW. THESE TAXES HAVE AROUSED PARTICULAR ATTENTION BECAUSE THEY ARE LEVIED ON SALES WITH PROGRESSIVE RATES. AS THEY MAINLY AFFECT LARGE BUSINESSES OWNED BY NON-DOMESTIC PERSONS, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TOOK ACTION AGAINST SUSPECTED ILLEGAL STATE AID. THE COMMISSION HAS STILL FAILED TO DEFEND ITS POSITION BEFORE THE EU JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE LITERATURE HAS EXTENSIVELY CRITICIZED THE CJEU-JUDGMENTS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO AUTHOR HAS ARGUED THAT MEMBER STATES' MEASURES LEADING TO COVERT STATE AID AND INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE POPULIST STATE'S ABUSE OF POWER AND THAT ABUSES ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO THE DECLINE OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THESE JURISDICTIONS. AS THINGS STAND TODAY, THE EU LEGAL INSTRUMENTS HAVE NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNVEILED THE TYPE OF ABUSE. THE PRESENT PAPER SEEKS TO EXPLAIN HOW THE. MEMBER STATES COULD COMMIT ABUSES OF TAXATION POWER WHEN APPLYING SPECIAL SECTORAL TAXES.
768	ARTICLE 7 OF THE TREATY ON THE EUROPEAN UNION ENVISAGES A MECHANISM FOR RESPONDING TO BREACHING BY MEMBER STATES THE VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROCLAIMED BY THE UNION, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF SANCTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE EU STRUCTURES ARE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THIS MECHANISM, DESPITE THE REASONS FOR ITS APPLICATION. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE HISTORY OF THIS CLAUSE IN EUROPEAN LEGISLATION AND THE FIRST ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE DUBIOUS DECISIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES. THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE CASES OF POLAND AND HUNGARY IN LIGHT OF DISCUSSIONS TO INITIATE THE ARTICLE 7 PROCEDURES AGAINST THESE COUNTRIES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT SUCH AN OUTCOME IS UNLIKELY. IT IS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE CLAUSE WAS DELIBERATELY FORMULATED SO THAT IT ALLOWS TO LIMIT THE ACTIONS OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS, TO LEAVE DECISIONS IN THE HANDS OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SETTLE THE DISPUT THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS. THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO INFLUENCE VALUES-VIOLATING MEMBER STATES.
769	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (PCAOB) INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION PROGRAM ON COMPANIES' FINANCING AND INVESTING DECISIONS. DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES REGRESSION ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT COMPANIES RESPOND TO THEIR AUDITOR RECEIVING A "DEFICIENCY-FREE'' INSPECTION REPORT BY ISSUING ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL CAPITAL AMOUNTING TO 1.4 PERCENT OF ASSETS AND INCREASING INVESTMENT BY 0.5 PERCENT OF ASSETS. THESE EFFECTS ARE LARGER FOR (1) FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED COMPANIES AND (2) COMPANIES LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE THERE IS NO REGULATOR OR THE REGULATOR DOES NOT CONDUCT INSPECTIONS. FURTHER, THE EFFECT ON FINANCING DECISIONS IS STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WITH (1) LOW CORRUPTION, (2) STRONG RULE OF LAW, AND (3) HIGH REGULATORY QUALITY. DESCRIPTIVE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT INSPECTIONS INCREASE THE USE OF FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN DEBT CONTRACTS, WHICH IS LIKELY ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH INSPECTIONS GENERATE REAL EFFECTS. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE VALUE OF PCAOB INSPECTIONS IN MITIGATING FINANCING FRICTIONS FOR NON-U.S. COMPANIES.
770	PANDEMIC VIOLENCE AND CRIMINALITY ARE ANATHEMA TO A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. AND YET, IN LATIN AMERICA, BOTH OPERATE SIDE BY SIDE. ILLICIT ACTIVITY HAS PROPAGATED PRECISELY BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC STATES OF THE REGION HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE AT ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW VIA PUBLIC SECURITY MECHANISMS LIKE THE POLICE. THIS INEFFECTIVENESS HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT OF POLICE FORCES. HENCE, AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR STUDENTS OF STATE-BUILDING AND DEMOCRATISATION IS: WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF THE POLICE? WE ARGUE THAT POLICE FORCES THAT ARE LOCAL AND UNPROFESSIONAL WILL BE LESS TRUSTED AND VIEWED AS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THEIR MORE CENTRALISED AND PROFESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS OF STATE AND FEDERAL POLICE. IN SHORT, WE FIND THAT CENTRALISATION AND PROFESSIONALISATION MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CRIME VICTIMISATION AND POLICE CORRUPTION ON THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE POLICE IN MEXICO. THESE FINDINGS ARE DRAWN FROM AN ANALYSIS OF THE NATIONAL SURVEY OF VICTIMISATION AND PERCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC SECURITY (ENVIPE) IN MEXICO FOR 2012 AND 2018.
771	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPERIENCES OF MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES OVER THE PERIOD 1960-2014 FOCUSING ON TWO GROUPS OF COUNTRIES. THE "CONVERGENCE SUCCESS" GROUP INCLUDES MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES WHICH HAVE GRADUATED TO A HIGH-INCOME STATUS OR HAVE ACHIEVED RAPID CONVERGENCE PROGRESS. WHEN AN ECONOMY IN THE "NONSUCCESS" GROUP EXPERIENCED GROWTH DECELERATION AND FAILED TO ADVANCE TO A HIGH-INCOME STATUS, WE DEFINED SUCH EPISODES AS THE "MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP." WE OBSERVE NO CLEAR PATTERN THAT THE RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF GROWTH DECELERATION WAS HIGHER FOR UPPER MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES, THEREBY REFUTING THE "MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP HYPOTHESIS." THE PROBIT REGRESSIONS SHOW THAT "CONVERGENCE SUCCESSES" TEND TO MAINTAIN STRONG HUMAN CAPITAL, A HIGH WORKING-AGE POPULATION RATIO, EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, LOW-PRICED INVESTMENT GOODS, AND HIGH LEVELS OF HIGH-TECH EXPORTS AND PATENTS. ADDING TO UNFAVORABLE DEMOGRAPHIC, TRADE, AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS, RAPID INVESTMENT EXPANSION, HASTY DEREGULATION, AND HURRIED FINANCIAL OPENING COULD CAUSE THE "NONSUCCESSES" TO FALL INTO THE MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP.
772	EVERY YEAR, MORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED DEFENDING THE ENVIRONMENT THAN ARE SOLDIERS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND AUSTRALIA ON OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENTS IN WAR ZONES COMBINED. DURING THE LAST 15 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF BOTH DEATHS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENDERS, AND THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEY OCCUR, HAVE INCREASED. RECORDED DEATHS HAVE INCREASED FROM TWO PER WEEK TO FOUR PER WEEK OVER THIS PERIOD. THESE DEATHS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO CONFLICT OVER NATURAL RESOURCES, ACROSS A RANGE OF SECTORS. OF 683 TOTAL DEATHS, >230 WERE RELATED TO MINING AND AGRIBUSINESS BETWEEN 2014 AND 2017. WE FIND THAT RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION INDICES ARE CLOSELY LINKED TO PATTERNS OF KILLINGS. USING SPATIAL DATA, WE INVESTIGATE THE DRIVERS OF THESE CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE AND SEEK TO IDENTIFY WHO MAY BE MOST AT RISK AND WHY. WE ARGUE THAT BUSINESSES, INVESTORS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AT BOTH ENDS OF THE CHAIN OF VIOLENCE NEED TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE.
773	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT LEGAL EDUCATION IS CURRENTLY GRAPPLING WITH THREE NARRATIVES OF TECHNOLOGY'S ROLE IN EITHER AUGMENTING, DISRUPTING OR ENDING THE CURRENT LEGAL SERVICES ENVIRONMENT. IT IDENTIFIES EACH OF THESE NARRATIVES WITHIN FEATURES OF CURRICULUM DESIGN THAT RESPOND TO LEGAL PROFESSIONAL ARCHETYPES OF HOW LAWYERS REACT TO LAWTECH. IN TRACING HOW THESE INFLUENTIAL NARRATIVES AND ASSOCIATED ARCHETYPES FEATURE IN THE LAW CURRICULUM, THE ARTICLE MAPS THE EVOLVING INTERSECTION OF LAWTECH, THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND LEGAL SERVICES DELIVERY IN LEGAL EDUCATION. IT CONCLUDES BY PROFFERING THE ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE OF 'ADAPTIVE PROFESSIONALISM', WHICH EMPHASISES THE COMPLEX AND CONTEXTUAL NATURE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION, AND THEREFORE PROVIDES A MORE COHERENT DIRECTION FOR ADAPTATION OF THE LAW CURRICULUM. THROUGH THIS MORE NUANCED AND GROUNDED APPROACH, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT LAW SCHOOLS MIGHT EQUIP LAW GRADUATES TO EMBRACE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS WHILE HOLDING ON TO ESSENTIAL NOTIONS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT, ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW.
774	THE US INITIATED A SECTION 301 INVESTIGATION AGAINST CHINA IN 2017. SUCH A UNILATERAL INVESTIGATION HAS RUN COUNTER TO THE EXPLICIT COMMITMENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. EVEN THE BASICALLY REASONABLE 'FOUR CORNERS' DEFENSE CAN NEITHER APPLY NOR JUSTIFY THIS INVESTIGATION. CONSEQUENTLY, ESPECIALLY BASED ON THE PANEL'S ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS, THE CONDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY CONFIRMED BY THE PANEL OF DS152 CASE IN THE WTO SHOULD BE UNTENABLE IN THIS LATEST SPECIFIC CONTEXT. BY REUTILIZING THIS GLOBALLY AVERSIVE TOOL, THE UNITED STATES COULD POSSIBLY PROVE ITSELF TO BE AN UNRELIABLE PARTNER AND THIS WOULD UNAVOIDABLY INCUR SEVERE REPUTATIONAL COSTS AND OTHER POTENTIAL HARMS TO ITSELF FURTHERMORE, THIS MIGHT, TO SOME DEGREE, UNDERMINE OR EVEN UNDO THE ADVANCES ACHIEVED IN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IN WORLD TRADE AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WTO. ALL IN ALL, ONLY MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SOLUTIONS ARE MOST DESIRABLE, EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE FOR BOTH CHINA AND THE US.
775	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE JAMES ELLIOT CONSTRUCTION CASE DELIVERED ON 27 OCTOBER 2016. IN ITS DECISION, THE COURT HAS FOR THE FIRST TIME AFFIRMED ITS JURISDICTION TO INTERPRET HARMONISED TECHNICAL STANDARDS ON A PRELIMINARY REFERENCE. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, WE ARGUE THAT THE DECISION MARKS AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH IN THE EVOLUTION OF EU LAW BY RECOGNISING HARMONISED TECHNICAL STANDARDS AS PART OF UNION LAW. THIS OPENING OFFERS NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR LITIGATING TECHNICAL STANDARDS AND ASSURING THE CENTRALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE INTERNAL MARKET. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ANALYSING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISION IN RELATION TO THE MERONI DOCTRINE, THE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE ACCESS TO THE ACTS OF THE UNION AND THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE IMPACT THAT GREATER LITIGATION OVER HARMONISED TECHNICAL STANDARDS MAY HAVE ON THE CASELOAD OF THE COURT.
776	THIS PRESENTATION CONSIDERED THE TENSION BETWEEN THE GLOBAL CHARACTER OF GENETIC TECHNO-SCIENCE AND ITS LOCAL APPLICATION IN SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS. IT PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE WAY IN WHICH TECHNICAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM ETHICAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IN KEY POLICY DELIBERATIONS AND NOTED THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS DIVISION OF INTELLECTUAL LABOUR ON CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDES TO FORENSIC GENETICS. IT ALSO CRITICISED THE ADEQUACY OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE INVESTIGATIVE UTILITY OF A RANGE OF FORENSIC GENETIC TECHNOLOGIES AND SUGGESTED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL 'OBSERVATORY' CAPABLE OF COLLATING COMPARATIVE DATA ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USES OF FORENSIC GENETICS IN SUPPORT OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS. THE PROVISION OF SUCH DATA IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF FUTURE DELIBERATIONS OF FORENSIC GENETICS AND THE DESIGN OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS THAT WILL GOVERN THEIR USES.

777	CHINA HAS BECOME THE THIRD LARGEST SOURCE OF OUTWARD DIRECT INVESTMENT (ODI). THIS PAPER STUDIES HOW INSTITUTIONS IN THE HOST COUNTRIES AFFECT THE LOCATION CHOICES OF CHINA'S ODI. BASED ON A DEAL-LEVEL SAMPLE FROM 2002-2011, THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY TESTS HOW POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTRD OF CORRUPTION IN THE HOST COUNTRIES AFFECT THE LOCATION CHOICES OF CHINA'S ODI. ON TOP OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, WE STUDY THE EFFECTS OF TAX EVASION AND NATURAL RESOURCES IN HOST COUNTRIES, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. WE FIND THAT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE HOST COUNTRIES ARE NOT MAJOR CONCERNS OF THE ODI, WHILE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE LOCATIONS OF ODI. IN ADDITION, CHINA'S ODI TENDS TO AVOID COUNTRIES WITH STRICT LEGAL SYSTEMS. TAX EVASION AND RESOURCES ARE ALSO MAJOR MOTIVES OF CHINA'S ODI. GENERAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND TAX EVASION ARE SUBSTITUTES IN CHINA'S ODI LOCATION DECISIONS.
778	DRAWING ON THE HISTORICAL INSTITUTIONALISTS' EMPHASIS ON THE EFFECTS OF IDEAS ON POLICY MAKING, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC IDEAS AND IDEOLOGIES ON CHINA'S TRADE POLICY MAKING WITH REGARD TO THE SIGNING OF THE WTO AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES IN 1999. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT TRADE LIBERALIZATION IN CHINA WAS A RESULT OF TOP CHINESE LEADERS' EMBRACE OF NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMIC IDEAS WHICH CONCEIVE A SMALL ROLE FOR THE STATE IN THE MARKETPLACE, MAINLY AS THE REGULATOR OF THE MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND AS THE ENFORCER OF THE RULE OF LAW, RATHER THAN AS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE MARKETPLACE. TOP CHINESE LEADERS' SOCIALIZATION WITH NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMIC IDEAS ENABLED THEM TO FORGE A POLITICAL CONSENSUS TO LINK STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE (SOE) REFORMS WITH SPEEDY WTO ACCESSION AND LED TO CHINA'S MAJOR CONCESSIONS IN WTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES IN 1999 WHICH WERE INCONCEIVABLE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO.
779	THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW THE BOOSTING APPROACH CAN SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS IN TWO WAYS: (1) AS A PREDICTIVE TOOL TO FORECAST CORPORATE PERFORMANCE, AND RANK ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE VARIABLES ACCORDING TO THEIR IMPACT ON PERFORMANCE, AND (2) AS AN INTERPRETATIVE TOOL TO GENERATE ALTERNATING DECISION TREES THAT CAPTURE THE NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIP AMONG ACCOUNTING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE PERFORMANCE. WE COMPARE OUR RESULTS USING ADABOOST WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION, BAGGING, AND RANDOM FORESTS. WE CONDUCT 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS ON ONE SAMPLE EACH OF S&P 500 COMPANIES, AMERICAN DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS (ADRS) OF LATIN AMERICAN COMPANIES AND LATIN AMERICAN BANKS. ADABOOST RESULTS INDICATE THAT LARGE COMPANIES PERFORM BETTER THAN SMALL COMPANIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE COMPANIES HAVE A LIMITED LONG-TERM ASSETS TO SALES RATIO. PERFORMANCE IMPROVES FOR LARGE LAADR COMPANIES WHEN THE COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE IS CHARACTERIZED BY A WEAK RULE OF LAW. IN THE CASE OF S&P 500 COMPANIES, PERFORMANCE INCREASES WHEN THE COMPENSATION FOR TOP OFFICERS IS MOSTLY VARIABLE.
780	WITH ITS KADI-JUDGMENT, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) FIRMLY REJECTED THE FIRST INSTANCE KADI/ YUSUF-JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (CFI). THE ECJ MADE UNAMBIGUOUSLY CLEAR THAT COMMUNITY LAW, IN PARTICULAR ITS BASIC, CORE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS VALUES PREVAIL OVER ANY INTERNATIONAL LAW OBLIGATIONS OF THE EC AND ITS MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND THE UN CHARTER. AS A CONSEQUENCE THEREOF' INDIVIDUALS TARGETED BY UN SANCTIONS MUST HAVE ACCESS TO FULL JUDICIAL REVIEW IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING PROCEDURAL RIGHTS AS GUARANTEED BY THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR). AS A RESULT, THE ECJ PROVED THAT THE COMMUNITY IS INDEED BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM - HOW IMPORTANT IT MAY BE - CANNOT BE USED AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR COMPLETELY ABROGATING EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AS GUARANTEED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND ITS MEMBER STATES.
781	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES ALGERIA'S GROWTH COMPETITIVENESS IN RELATION TO MAGHRIB AND NON-MAGHRIB COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE USES THE PILLARS OF GROWTH COMPETITIVENESS MODEL. ACCORDING TO THIS, GROWTH COMPETITIVENESS RESTS ON THREE PILLARS: MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. WE OPERATIONALISE THIS MODEL BY APPLYING A STATISTICAL CLUSTER PROCEDURE TO DATA FOR 101 COUNTRIES FOR 2003. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALGERIA HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH GHANA, TANZANIA, INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, SENEGAL AND SRI LANKA THAN IT DOES WITH ITS NEIGHBOURING MOROCCO OR TUNISIA. FROM A MAGHRIB PERSPECTIVE, ALGERIA HAS THE LEAST STABLE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND SLOWEST TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS. THE COUNTRY WASTES THE MOST OF ITS ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND HAS THE LOWEST CREDIT RATING AND WEAKEST RULE OF LAW. IT IS ALSO THE LEAST INNOVATIVE AND HAS ACHIEVED THE LEAST IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER. ON THE WHOLE, ALGERIA LAGS FAR BEHIND MANY COUNTRIES. WE EXPLAIN THE REASONS FOR THIS BY USING IBN KHALDUN'S THEORY OF THE RISE AND FALL OF DYNASTIES.
782	IN THE WAKE OF 'END OF IDEOLOGY' PREDICTIONS OF THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY, NATIONALIST IDEOLOGIES AND DISCOURSES HAVE PROVEN STRIKINGLY RESILIENT, AS HAVE AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES RELYING ON NATIONALISM FOR THEIR LEGITIMACY AND POWER. MEANWHILE, SO-CALLED LIBERAL POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS AND THEORISTS WHO CLAIM COMMITMENTS TO RIGHTS AND JUSTICE MAKE ARGUMENTS THAT INVIGORATE NATIONALIST SUBJECTIVITIES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ESSAY EXPLAINS HOW EVEN THOSE WHO ARE CRITICAL OF NATIONALIST, AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES NONETHELESS USE A VOCABULARY THAT REINVIGORATES JACQUES DERRIDA'S 'SOVEREIGN BEAST'. INSIGHTS FROM MIGUEL DE CERVANTES AND FRANZ KAFKA ARE USED TO AMPLIFY ENGIN ISIN'S TIMELY IF NOT URGENT ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THEORIZING CITIZENSHIP AS ENACTMENTS THAT ARE CREATIVE, INNOVATIVE, AND AUTONOMOUS, AND NOT AS A STATUS DERIVED FROM MEMBERSHIP. PLATO'S VIEWS ON JUSTICE AND THE 'HEALTHY POLITEIA', AS WELL AS EXAMPLES OF CREATIVITY WITHIN EXISTING GOVERNMENTS ARE ELUCIDATED TO FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE BENEFITS OF THEORIZING NEW SCRIPTS FOR CITIZENS OVER PROPOSING NEW THEORIES FOR GOVERNMENTS.
783	PLEA BARGAINING IS ONE OF THE PROCEDURAL TOOLS INTRODUCED INTO THE NIGERIAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ENSURE QUICK DISPENSATION OF JUSTICE, SAVE TIME AND RESOURCES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT ON A TRIAL, AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF PRISON CONGESTION IN THE COUNTRY. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE APPLICATION OF THIS PROCEDURAL TOOL IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN CORRUPTION CASES IN NIGERIA. IT ARGUES THAT PLEA BARGAINING IS USED BY THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRIME COMMISSION (EFCC) MAINLY TO RECOVER LOOTED RESOURCES FROM THE CULPRITS WITHOUT GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW AND THE ESSENCE AND PURPOSES THAT PUNISHMENT SERVES. ALSO, THE APPLICATION OF PLEA BARGAINING IN VARIOUS CORRUPTION CASES HAS RESULTED IN LIGHTER PUNISHMENTS FOR THE CULPRITS. THE PAPER DRAWS ON DETERRENCE THEORY TO ARGUE THAT THE WAY PLEA BARGAINING IS BEING APPLIED IN CORRUPTION CASES MAY ENCOURAGE CORRUPT PRACTICES, RATHER THAN DETER OFFENDING. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE OUTCOME IN FIGHTING CORRUPTION IN NIGERIA, THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE UPHELD.
784	TWO FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS UNDERPIN MODERN DEMOCRACY: THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. INDEED, DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY REQUIRES FREE AND EQUAL PARTICIPATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS TO REACH ITS IDEALISED FORM. HOWEVER, SUCH PARTICIPATION IS OFTEN OMITTED FROM THE CREATION OF AUSTRALIAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO A LACK OF A DUTY, AT COMMON LAW OR IN STATUTE, IMPOSED ON FEDERAL RULE-MAKERS TO CONSULT WITH THE IMPACTED POPULATION PRIOR TO THE INSTRUMENT'S DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. AT COMMON LAW, THE CONSULTATION DEFICIENCY IS DUE, PARTLY, TO ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS THAT AFFECT A BROADER CLASS BEING A POLICY MATTER, AND OFTEN UNTOUCHABLE BY THE JUDICIARY; WHEREAS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT INDIVIDUALS, THE RULE-MAKER IS LIKELY BOUND BY THE RULES OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS. IN STATUTE, ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGH LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS TO IMPOSE A GREATER DUTY TO CONSULT WITH THOSE IMPACTED BY ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS; HOWEVER, THESE HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.
785	IDENTIFYING MECHANISMS ABLE TO SUSTAIN COSTLY COOPERATION AMONG SELF-INTERESTED AGENTS IS A CENTRAL PROBLEM ACROSS SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION IS PEER PUNISHMENT: WHEN AGENTS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SANCTION DEFECTORS, CLASSICAL BEHAVIORAL EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT COOPERATION CAN TAKE ROOT. OVERLOOKED FROM STANDARD EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT REAL-WORLD HUMAN PUNISHMENT-THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE-IS INTRINSICALLY NOISY. HERE WE SHOW THAT STOCHASTIC PUNISHMENT FALLS SHORT OF SUSTAINING COOPERATION IN THE REPEATED PUBLIC GOOD GAME. AS PUNISHMENT NOISE INCREASES, WE FIND THAT CONTRIBUTIONS DECREASE AND PUNISHMENT EFFORTS INTENSIFY, RESULTING IN A 45% DROP IN GAINS COMPARED TO A NOISELESS CONTROL. MOREOVER, WE OBSERVE THAT UNCERTAINTY CAUSES A RISE IN ANTISOCIAL PUNISHMENT, A MUTUALLY HARMFUL BEHAVIOR PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIETIES WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW. OUR APPROACH BRINGS TO LIGHT CHALLENGES TO COOPERATION THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY ECONOMIC RATIONALITY AND STRENGTHENS THE CASE FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF NOISE-AND NOT JUST BIAS-ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR.
786	ALTHOUGH LATIN AMERICA PLAYS A MINIMAL ROLE IN DEBATES ON THE 'LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER', SCHOLARS RECOGNIZE THE REGION'S INFLUENCE ON INTERNATIONAL LAW, NORMS, AND INSTITUTIONS. WE CONTEND THAT THESE LATIN AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORDER SPRING FROM A TRADITION OF 'REPUBLICAN INTERNATIONALISM', ROOTED IN THE REGION'S DOMESTIC POLITICAL TRADITIONS AND PRACTICES. REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWER, ASSOCIATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAD IMPORTANT COROLLARIES IN LATIN AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, INCLUDING SOVEREIGN EQUALITY, CONFEDERATION AND REGIONAL COOPERATION, AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARBITRATION. THESE REPUBLICAN INTERNATIONALIST IDEAS SHAPED LATIN AMERICA'S DIPLOMATIC TRADITIONS AND ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND BEYOND. ATTENTION TO REPUBLICAN INTERNATIONALISM AND LATIN AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS DEMONSTRATES HOW ACTORS BEYOND THE NORTH ATLANTIC SHAPED THE ORIGINS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER. THIS STUDY ALSO ADVANCES DEBATES ON THE SOURCES OF THE LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER BY DEMONSTRATING THE DISTINCTIVE INFLUENCE OF REPUBLICAN IDEAS AND PRACTICES.
787	THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE WAY IN WHICH THE NOTION OF COMPETING CONSTITUTIONALISMS ILLUSTRATES AND EXPLAINS THE EVOLUTION OF POLAND'S INSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE DURING AND FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION FROM COMMUNIST RULE. THE PAPER CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF VARIANTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM ON CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESSES. WHILE RECENT THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND ILLUSTRATE CHALLENGES TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM SEVERAL DECADES AFTER POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION, THIS PAPER TRACES PROCESSES BY WHICH CITIZENS AND POLITICAL ELITES ACCEPT OR REJECT THE LEGITIMACY OF PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS, INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS. THE CONSTITUTION-DRAFTING PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE SOLIDARNOSC TRADE UNION FACILITATES AN ORIGINAL AND COMPARATIVE EXAMINATION OF THESE TOPICS. APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF COMPETING CONSTITUTIONALISMS TO THE ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUSLY UNSTUDIED ARCHIVAL, TEXT, NARRATIVE INTERVIEW AND SURVEY DATA, THE STUDY EXPOSES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE POLITICS OF CONSTITUTION MAKING ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE SYMBOLIC, SUBSTANTIVE AND AXIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM ON THE OTHER.
788	HOW DO GERMAN INTRA-PARTY TRIBUNALS MANAGE INTERNAL CONFLICTS? MORE SPECIFICALLY, WHY DO THEY ACCEPT SOME CASES FOR TRIAL BUT REJECT OTHERS? REQUIRED BY LAW TO STRICTLY ADHERE TO IMPLEMENT RULE OF LAW STANDARDS, GERMAN INTRA-PARTY TRIBUNALS ARE DESIGNED TO INSULATE CONFLICT REGULATION FROM POLITICS. MEANWHILE, RESEARCH ON JUDICIAL POLITICS HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS IN ACCEPTING CASES FOR TRIAL. BUILDING ON THE LATTER, WE DEVELOP A THEORY THAT EMPHASIZES TRIBUNALS' POLITICAL CONCERNS SUCH AS WINNING ELECTIONS. WE TEST OUR HYPOTHESES WITH A MIXED-EFFECTS LOGIT MODEL ON A NOVEL DATA SET COVERING 1088 TRIBUNAL DECISIONS IN SIX GERMAN PARTIES FROM 1967 UNTIL 2015. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT POLITICAL FACTORS EXERT A STRONG EFFECT ON TRIBUNAL CASE ACCEPTANCE. TRIBUNALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT CASES WHEN SUFFERING ELECTORAL LOSS AND AFTER LOSING GOVERNMENT OFFICE. MOREOVER, TRIBUNALS DISMISS CASES MORE EASILY WHEN THEIR PARTIES DISPLAY RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF POLICY AGREEMENT.
789	THIS ESSAY USES THE APPELLATE JUDICIAL OPINIONS IN MORE THAN 800 SUITS FOR FREEDOM FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TO ANALYZE THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY ANTEBELLUM JUDGES INCLUDED WHEN ISSUING THEIR DECISIONS. JUDGES USED ARGUMENTS THAT MIRRORED BROADER DEBATES BETWEEN ABOLITIONISTS AND PRO-SLAVERY ADVOCATES, WHILE ALSO UPHOLDING THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN DOING SO, THEY SOUGHT TO DEFEND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM FROM THE MANY CHALLENGES BROUGHT BY AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER ANTI-SLAVERY ACTIVISTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL BELIEFS ABOUT SLAVERY, JUDGES OFTEN CHOSE TO FRAME THEIR WRITTEN OPINIONS AROUND APPEALS TO MORALITY. THE USE OF MORAL ARGUMENTS ALLOWED JUDGES TO ANTICIPATE THE POSITIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS AND THEN RENDER THESE IDEAS IRRELEVANT IN THE FACE OF POSITIVE LAWS SUPPORTING SLAVERY. THE DECISIONS THEY MADE HAD REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR FUTURE LEGAL PATHWAYS TO FREEDOM, AND THE WAYS JUDGES CHOSE TO STRUCTURE THEIR DECISIONS REVEAL BOTH AWARENESS AND ANXIETY OVER THE POWER OF JUDICIAL CHALLENGES TO THE INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY.
790	THE EU INSTITUTIONS AND AGENCIES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY INVOLVED IN ENFORCING EU LAW DIRECTLY VIS-A-VIS PRIVATE ACTORS. A NUMBER OF SUCH EU ENTITIES HAVE ALSO ACQUIRED THE SO-CALLED EMERGENCY POWERS, WHICH ALLOW INTERFERENCE WITH THE LEGAL POSITION OF A PRIVATE PARTY. GIVEN THE LACK OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, THE QUESTION THAT THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES IS WHETHER RELEVANT SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW IN SUCH SITUATIONS TO PREVENT THE ABUSE OF EXECUTIVE DISCRETION BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. WHAT ARE THE RELEVANT SAFEGUARDS IN THE EMERGENCY IN THE EU IN THE FIRST PLACE? HAVING ANALYSED RELEVANT EU LEGISLATION AND CASE LAW, THE ARTICLE OFFERS A COMPLETE OVERVIEW OF ALL THE EXISTING EU ENTITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY POWERS AND SHOWS A GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EU LEGISLATOR HAS REGULATED PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS IN RELEVANT LAW. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHAT SAFEGUARDS NEED TO BE ENSURED IN AN EMERGENCY AND ARGUES FOR CLARITY OF LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORKS IN THIS RESPECT.
791	TRANSNATIONAL INFORMATION SHARING AMONG SECURITY AGENCIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BEYOND HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY MORE IMPORTANT OVER THE PAST DECADES. CENTRALISED DATABASES AND NUMEROUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL NETWORKS NOW FACILITATE COOPERATION AND INFORMATION SHARING. HOWEVER, SHARING INTELLIGENCE MAY NOT ONLY CONFLICT WITH THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (DATA PROTECTION/PRIVACY; PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE), BUT ALSO WITH THE ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE OF INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BUILT UPON SECRECY. POLICE AGENCIES OFTEN KEEP KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THEIR STRATEGIES SECRET AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. INTELLIGENCE SERVICES BUILD THEIR WORK AND STRATEGIES UPON SECRECY EVEN MORE. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE VARIATIONS OF SECRECY THAT CAN BE OBSERVED FOR POLICE AGENCIES AND SECRET SERVICES, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFORMATION SHARING AMONG SECURITY AGENCIES, SECRECY, TRUST, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN A NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE, THE PAPER EXPLORES ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS OF HOW SECRET THE WORK OF SECURITY AGENCIES SHOULD BE IN DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW SYSTEMS AND HOW ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE IMPROVED WITHOUT MAKING THESE INSTITUTIONS WORK LESS EFFECTIVELY.
792	THIS PAPER AIMS AT ANALYZING POPULAR PARTICIPATION MECHANISMS IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AS A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD. IT IS FOUND THAT, IN BRAZIL, DESPITE BEING ALREADY COVERED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN FORCE, POPULAR PARTICIPATION IS LIMITED TO SPECIFIC TIMES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING PROCEDURE, WEAKENING ITS ROLE OF SUPPORTING DECISION-MAKING BY THE GOVERNMENT AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ADOPT SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FAIR MEASURES. ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS OF A DEMOCRATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW IS THAT CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT (AND DUTY) TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN DECISION MAKING THAT MAY AFFECT ENVIRONMENTAL BALANCE. THE RESEARCH USED, IN ADDITION TO THE LEGAL-COMPARATIVE METHOD, THE LEGAL AND PROPOSITIONAL ONE IN ORDER TO SUGGEST THE NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS AND THE EXPANSION OF THE PARTICIPATION INSTRUMENTS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT EVALUATION PROCEDURES IN THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF FOREIGN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
793	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOME ADVANTAGE (HA) IN ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL (SOCCER). HA IS THE TENDENCY FOR TEAMS TO PERFORM BETTER WHEN PLAYING ON THEIR HOME GROUND THAN WHEN PLAYING AWAY. NATIONAL VARIATIONS IN HA ARE FOUND TO BE RELATED TO NATIONAL CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS. HA TENDS TO BE ELEVATED IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF COLLECTIVISM AND IN-GROUP FAVORITISM, AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE GOVERNANCE IS PRONE TO CORRUPTION AND WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT STRICTLY ADHERED TO. THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCEPT OF HA AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON THAT DERIVES FROM THE INFLUENCE OF SPECTATORS ON THE MATCH OFFICIALS. HA IS ALSO FOUND TO BE ELEVATED IN COUNTRIES WITH DIVERSE TERRAIN, BUT THE EFFECTS OF CULTURE PERSIST EVEN WHEN DIVERSITY OF TERRAIN IS CONTROLLED FOR. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE HYPOTHESIS THAT HA IS ELEVATED IN THE PRESENCE OF LARGE CROWDS OR POTENTIALLY VIOLENT SPECTATORS WAS NOT SUPPORTED.
794	IN DECEMBER 2013, THE COURT AT FIRST INSTANCE IN BONN RULED ON WHETHER GERMANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY COMPENSATION TO VICTIMS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE AIRSTRIKE ORDERED BY A GERMAN COLONEL IN 2009 IN KUNDUZ. WHEREAS THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH REJECTS LIABILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR SOVEREIGN ACTS IN ARMED CONFLICTS, THE COURT HELD THAT THE RULES OF GERMAN GOVERNMENTAL LIABILITY (AMTSHAFTUNG) DO-IN PRINCIPLE-APPLY TO ILLEGAL SOVEREIGN ACTS IN CONTEMPORARY ARMED CONFLICTS. HOWEVER, THE COURT DID NOT ADMIT THE CLAIM ON ITS MERITS. THIS JUDGMENT CAN, NONETHELESS, BE PLACED WITHIN THE LINE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS TO BE RESOLVED BY LAW AND NOT POLITICS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORY OF GERMAN JURISPRUDENCE REGARDING VICTIMS' COMPENSATION FOR HARM SUFFERED RESULTING FROM VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW. IT SUMMARIZES AND ASSESSES THE KUNDUZ JUDGMENT AND EXPLAINS WHY APPLYING LEGAL LIABILITY TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR SOVEREIGN ACTS IN BELLO IS A LOGICAL STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
795	PRIVATE AUTONOMY IS CURRENTLY ADVANCED AS A BASIS FOR THE LEGAL ENFORCEABILITY OF PRIVATE SELF-GOVERNANCE OF FAMILIES THROUGH CONTRACTUAL AND CORPORATE INSTRUMENTS, AKIN TO PRE-MODERN HOUSE LAWS OF PROMINENT FAMILIES. PRIVATE SELF-GOVERNANCE OF THE FAMILY IS DEVELOPED THROUGH TOOLS OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE (CORPORATE) GOVERNANCE. FAMILY GOVERNANCE THUS AIMS AT ORGANISING COMMITTED COLLECTIVE OWNERSHIP, AS STEWARD, WITHIN THE CURRENT GENERATION, AND DISTRIBUTION TO NEXT GENERATIONS, OF FAMILY ASSETS AND VALUES. FAMILIES, AND PROFESSIONAL FAMILY ADVISERS OF ALL SORTS, INCREASINGLY TAKE AN INTEREST IN FAMILY GOVERNANCE, WHILE CURRENTLY NO SOUND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IS AT HAND. THIS FLAW GIVES RISE TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTY. A MAJOR COMPLICATION IN THIS REGARD IS THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO FAMILY GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE HORIZONTAL EFFECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNING AND THE GOVERNED FAMILY MEMBERS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT A FIRST EXPLORATION OF THE MATTER FROM A BELGIAN PERSPECTIVE.
796	ZOMBIE COMPANIES EMERGED IN CHINA FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REASONS, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF EARLIER EXPANSIONARY ECONOMIC POLICIES. HAVING BEEN KEPT ALIVE THROUGH SUBSIDIES FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REASONS MORE RECENTLY ZOMBIE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF AMBITIOUS ELIMINATION POLICIES IN CHINA. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN TARGETS FOR ZOMBIE COMPANY ELIMINATION AND THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS IN ZOMBIE MARKET EXITS. YET AN EXAMINATION OF CASE LAW REVEALS LIMITED USAGE OF INSOLVENCY LAWS IN THE PROCESSES USED AND THIS IS UNSURPRISING GIVEN THE NASCENT STATE OF INSOLVENCY LAW AND SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS NECESSITATING ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACHES. IN RECOGNISING EXISTING LIMITATIONS THIS PAPER ADVOCATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HYBRID APPROACH TOWARDS ZOMBIE COMPANY ELIMINATION, USING MARKET BASED EXIT APPROACHES WHILE RECOGNISING THAT ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE SOCIAL SERVICES AND AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE CASES. USING A STEEL INDUSTRY CASE STUDY IT CONSIDERS HOW A GREATER ROLE FOR CREDITORS AND INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATORS CAN AID IN MARKET BASED APPROACHES, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS TO JUDICIAL AND COURT CAPACITY TO HANDLE INSOLVENCY CASES.
797	STUDIES OF CLIENTELISM TYPICALLY ASSUME THAT POLITICAL MACHINES DISTRIBUTE REWARDS TO PERSUADE OR MOBILIZE THE EXISTING ELECTORATE. WE ARGUE THAT REWARDS NOT ONLY INFLUENCE ACTIONS OF THE ELECTORATE, BUT CAN ALSO SHAPE ITS COMPOSITION. ACROSS THE WORLD, MACHINES EMPLOY VOTER BUYING TO IMPORT OUTSIDERS INTO THEIR DISTRICTS. VOTER BUYING DEMONSTRATES HOW CLIENTELISM CAN UNDERPIN ELECTORAL FRAUD, AND IT OFFERS AN EXPLANATION OF WHY MACHINES DELIVER REWARDS WHEN THEY CANNOT MONITOR VOTE CHOICES. OUR ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT VOTER BUYING DRAMATICALLY INFLUENCES MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN BRAZIL. A REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGN SUGGESTS THAT VOTER AUDITSWHICH UNDERMINED VOTER BUYINGDECREASED THE ELECTORATE BY 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND REDUCED THE LIKELIHOOD OF MAYORAL REELECTION BY 18 PERCENTAGE POINTS. CONSISTENT WITH VOTER BUYING, THESE EFFECTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN MUNICIPALITIES WITH LARGE VOTER INFLOWS, AND WHERE NEIGHBORING MUNICIPALITIES HAD LARGE VOTER OUTFLOWS. FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO AN ALTERNATIVE RESEARCH DESIGN USING A DIFFERENT DATA SET.
798	BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SOVIET GENERAL PROCURACY AND PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL PROSECUTORS, AS WELL AS ON CENTRAL STATE AND PARTY ARCHIVES, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE GENERAL PHENOMENON OF PROTECTION OF PARTY MEMBERS FROM PROSECUTION FOR ECONOMIC CRIMES AFTER THE WAR. THE AUTHOR SHOWS TO WHAT EXTENT THESE PRACTICES OF PROTECTION REFLECTED NOT ONLY THE EXISTENCE OF INFORMAL OR CRIMINAL ECONOMIC PRACTICES, AND LOCAL CLIENTELISM, BUT ALSO CONFLICTS OF LEGITIMACY WITHIN PATTERNS OF DISCIPLINING AND CRIMINALIZING BEHAVIORS, CONFRONTING THE LAW AND JUSTICE APPARATUS, ITS NORMS, PROCEDURES AND VALUES WITH THOSE OF THE PARTY. CONFRONTED WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE PROSECUTION TO PUT INTO PRACTICE THE EXTRAORDINARILY HARSH LAW OF JUNE 1947 AGAINST THEFT OF PUBLIC PROPERTY, NOTABLY LETHAL FOR THE WHOLE SOVIET PEOPLE, THE PARTY SYSTEMATIZED AND ORGANIZED PROTECTION AND DEFENSE OF ITS OWNS MEMBERS. A KEEN LOOK AT THE CHRONOLOGY SHOWS THE CONFLUENCE OF TWO TRENDS, I.E. SPONTANEOUS LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL RESPONSES TO A HARSH REPRESSIVE CAMPAIGN, AND A FINALLY CENTRALIZED PHENOMENON SEARCHING TO SOFTEN THE REPRESSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR PARTY MEMBERS. THE FORCE OF THE LAW IN IMPLEMENTING NEW VALUES AND PUNISHING SOME ECONOMIC BEHAVIORS, WHEN ENDORSED BY THE JUSTICE AND POLICE OFFICIALS, WAS COUNTERACTED AND MODIFIED BY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL NETWORKS RAMIFIED TO MOSCOW. USING LOCAL AND PROVINCIAL EXAMPLES, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES, ON THE ONE HAND, THE ANXIETY OF PROSECUTORS, CONSIDERING THEMSELVES THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW, BUT AT THE SAME TIME PARTY MEMBERS AND RELIANT ON THE LOCAL PARTY ORGANIZATION, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOW SENSE OF JUSTICE AND THE CONTEMPT FOR LAW OF PARTY MEMBERS, WHO WERE ULTIMATELY CONDEMNED ONLY WHEN PROTECTION BY THE PARTY FAILED. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES EPISODES OF THE DAILY LIFE OF PROSECUTORS, SUMMONED TO COME TO THE PARTY COMMITTEE FOR A MIMICKED TRIAL. THESE EPISODES ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF CERTAIN SECTORS OF SOVIET SOCIETY TO ACCEPT THE RULE OF LAW AND OF PHENOMENA OF NEGOTIATION AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THESE PRACTICES OF LEGAL PROTECTION BY THE PARTY (AS BY THE STATE AND THE ARMY FOR THEIR OFFICIALS) OPERATED AS THE REMNANTS OF THE ANCIENT SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE, BY ESTATES (SOSLOVIE). THEY OFFER A VIEW ON THE SOVIET SOCIETY AFTER THE WAR WHICH WAS GENUINELY SEGMENTED AND STRATIFIED AND WHERE THE RULE OF LAW WAS CONFRONTED WITH CONTRADICTORY INTERPRETATIONS AND EVEN OPENLY REJECTED WHEN APPLIED TO CERTAIN PEOPLE AND IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE JUSTICE APPARATUS, THE PROSECUTION.
799	A SETTLEMENT AMONG CONFLICTING PARTIES IS USUALLY REGARDED AS AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO A JUDICIAL DISPUTE, BUT SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN THE RICH AND THE POOR CAN ALSO BE A SYMPTOM OF UNEQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. WE DEVELOP A MODEL OF SETTLEMENTS THAT TAKES WEALTH DISPARITY BETWEEN THE PARTIES INTO ACCOUNT, AS THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM MUST EXERT COSTLY EFFORT IN COURT. RICHER LITIGANTS CAN DRIVE A HARDER BARGAIN, AND ACHIEVE A MORE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT PRICE (THE PRICE EFFECT ), BUT SO CAN POORER LITIGANTS IF THEY HAVE CONNECTIONS OR KNOW THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BETTER, E.G., POLICE OFFICERS. WE PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRICE EFFECT USING DATA ON CRIMINAL TRAFFIC OFFENSES IN RUSSIA, WHERE THE PROCESS ALLOWS FOR CIVIL-STYLE VICTIM-DEFENDANT SETTLEMENTS. IN LINE WITH THE THEORETICAL PREDICTION, WE FIND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SETTLE MORE OFTEN AS DEFENDANTS (AND LESS OFTEN AS VICTIMS) THAN THEIR COMPARABLE WEALTH GROUP. OTHER POTENTIAL REASONS, LIKE JUDICIAL BIAS, FAIL TO EXPLAIN THESE DIFFERENCES. THE PRICE EFFECT HIGHLIGHTS THE FAILURE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO PROVIDE EQUAL JUSTICE. (C) 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

800	MANY JURISDICTIONS ARE EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY AS A POTENTIAL GATEKEEPER FOR NEW COURT PROCESSES. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE LESS RELIANCE ON LEGAL AID AND FIVE UP JUDICIAL RESOURCE, POLICY MAKERS ARE KEEN TO EMBRACE "ONLINE COURT" SOLUTIONS, AND "DIGITAL BY DEFAULT" APPROACHES TO RESOLVING LEGAL PROBLEMS FOR LITIGANTS IN PERSON. IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ONLINE SMALL CLAIMS PROCESS HAS REPLACED THE COURT BUILDING, WITH AN END-TO-END PATHWAY-STYLE ONLINE PROCESS WHICH PROVIDES LEGAL ADVICE, MEDIATION, AND ACCESS TO AN ONLINE JUDGE. IN THE UK, PLANS ARE AFOOT FOR ALL CIVIL CASES UNDER 25,000 POUND TO BE REFERRED TO AN "ONLINE COURT". IN THE RECENT CASE OF R. (ON THE APPLICATION OF UNISON) V LORD CHANCELLOR, (1) LORD REED SAID THAT THE COURT IS MORE THAN A SERVICE TO THE USER AND ACCESS TO THE COURTS IS NOT OF VALUE ONLY TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN A DISPUTE BUT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIETY. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ONCE MUCH OF THE WORK OF THE COURT IS ONLINE AND THEREFORE THE INSTITUTION OF THE COURT IS NOT A PLACE OR A BUILDING, HOW CAN WE MEASURE WHETHER THE SERVICE PROVIDED TO LITIGANTS IS FAIR ? WILL TECHNOLOGY CHANGE THE WAY WE USE THE LEGAL PROCESS SO THAT THE TRADITIONAL VISION OF THE COURT HAS TO BE AMENDED OR QUALIFIED AND HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE PRINCIPLE OF OPEN JUSTICE ? THIS PAPER WILL CONSIDER WHETHER THE PRINCIPLE OF OPEN JUSTICE CAN BE UPHELD EFFECTIVELY IN THIS NEW TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT. OPEN JUSTICE EXISTS TO PROTECT THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC TO BE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COURT; BOTH THROUGH THEIR ABILITY TO ATTEND INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THE RIGHT OF THE MEDIA TO BE IN THE COURTROOM AND TO INFORM MORE BROADLY OPEN JUSTICE HAS BEEN UPHELD BY THE SENIOR JUDICIARY IN SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC CASES SUCH AS SCOTT V SCOTT(2) AND R. V SUSSEX JUSTICES EX P. MCCARTHY.(3) OPEN JUSTICE IS GUARANTEED AS PART OF A RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL, SUCH AS IN ART.6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS: "EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO A FAIR AND PUBLIC HEARING". THE QUESTION OF OPENNESS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THEREFORE THE DESIGN OF THE ONLINE COURT. THIS PAPER ENVISAGES THAT FOR THE PRINCIPLE TO BE EFFECTIVE IT SHOULD BE REIMAGINED FOR A NEW VIRTUAL CONTEXT.
801	WE DEMONSTRATE THAT ARBITRAGE RISK, CONSTRUCTED USING THREE MEASURES - NOISE TRADER RISK, TRADING COST AND INFORMATION UNCERTAINTY - CAN PREDICT THE RETURN OF STOCKS CROSS-SECTIONALLY IN CHINA. THE FINDINGS ARE BROADLY CONSISTENT EVEN WHEN OUT-OF-SAMPLE TESTS ARE CONDUCTED USING THE FAMA-MACBETH CROSS-SECTIONAL REGRESSION APPROACH. WE ALSO CONSTRUCT HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIOS USING THE INFORMATION ARISING FROM ARBITRAGE RISK AND FIND THE EXISTENCE OF ABNORMAL RETURNS WHICH IS ROBUST TO THE USE OF VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS CONSTRUCTED BY RE-SAMPLING THE OBSERVATIONS THROUGH MULTIPLE APPROACHES (E.G., BY MARKET CAPITALIZATION AND BY BOOK-TO-MARKET RATIO). LASTLY, WE RECONSTRUCT OUR PORTFOLIOS BY CONSIDERING THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE CHINESE STOCK MARKET (E.G., THE DOMINANCE OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS). OUR TRADING STRATEGIES AGAIN SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN ABNORMAL RETURNS, SUGGESTING THAT ARBITRAGE RISK CAN BE USEFUL TO CONSTRUCT EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS IN CHINA.
802	THE SUBJECT. THE AUTHORS ANALYZE THE PROCESS AND RESULTS OF 30 YEARS OF REFORMING JUDICIAL ACTIVITY IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA, FORMULATE AND SUBSTANTIATE THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF PROMISING TRANSFORMATIONS AND SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR CONTINUING THE REFORM, INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS. THE PURPOSE IS TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RUSSIAN JUDICIAL REFORM NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY INCLUDES THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL AND FORMAL LEGAL METHODS. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THE COURT IS ONE OF THE MOST DEMOCRATIC AND CIVILIZED TOOLS FOR RESOLVING SOCIAL CONFLICTS AND PROTECTING HUMAN INTERESTS. JUDICIAL REFORM IS A CONCEPTUALLY FORMED, CARDINAL AND PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION CARRIED OUT IN THE HISTORICAL PERIOD IN ORDER TO ORGANIZE THE OPTIMAL MODEL OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY OF ITS FUNCTIONING TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE. THE RUSSIAN COURT WAS TRANSFORMED, BECAME THE REAL JUDICIARY POWER AND TOOK ITS PLACE IN THE STATE MECHANISM DURING THE REFORM PERIOD. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS BUILT ON NEW PRINCIPLES, PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION WAS UPDATED, A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO IMPROVE THE STATUS OF THE COURT AND ITS ROLE IN SOCIETY. IT IS NECESSARY TO GENERALIZE THE EXISTING PRACTICE AND REGULATE ALL PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION OF THE JUDICIAL CORPS AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL. WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PROCESS CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT. JUSTICE AS A SOCIAL AND LEGAL VALUE AND A SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL GOAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN RUSSIAN DOMESTIC POLICY AND STRATEGIC PROJECTS. THE STRATEGY AND TACTICS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY, MORE ACTIVE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN TOOLS IN IT, WHILE ENSURING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THIS PROCESS, ARE PARTICULARLY IN DEMAND IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, THE CONCLUSION IS MADE THAT JUDICIAL REFORM IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY. HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR SOCIAL INFLUENCE HAS NOT BEEN EXHAUSTED. THEREFORE, CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS AND SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER TRANSFORMATIONS, INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN FORMULATED AND SUBSTANTIATED.
803	THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FULL-SCALE AGGRESSION, WHICH BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 24, 2022 BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AGAINST UKRAINE, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE UKRAINIAN -JAPANESE BILATERAL DIALOGUE. JAPAN HAS PUBLICLY SUPPORTED THE INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE, AND HAS STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE RUSSIAN INVASION AS WELL. ALONG WITH THIS, TOKYO TOOK PROACTIVE STEPS TO PROMOTE THE IDEA OF SUPPORTING AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE IN ITS CONFRONTATION AGAINST THE AGGRESSOR. SPECIFICALLY, JAPAN TOOK ACTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF COOPERATION WITH VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER MULTILATERAL FORMATS (UN, G7, G20, ASEAN + JAPAN, NATO, CENTRAL ASIA PLUS JAPAN ETC.). JAPAN ENDEAVORED TO BRING THE ATTENTION OF ALL PARTNERS WITHIN INTERNATIONAL FORMATS TO THE RUSSIAN INVASION, EMPHASIZING THAT THE AGGRESSION COMMITTED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS A CRIMINAL ACT AND A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THAT JAPAN IN ITS APPEALS AND ACTIVITY TO SUPPORT UKRAINE PRIMARILY EMPHASIZES THE VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BY RUSSIA: JAPAN DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF PART OF UKRAINIAN TERRITORY AND ALSO CONDEMNS THE CHANGE OF THE STATUS QUO BY FORCE. BASED ON THE PROCESSED SOURCES AND HISTORIOGRAPHY, IT FOLLOWS THAT TOKYO'S OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE RUSSOUKRAINIAN WAR WAS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS: POSTULATING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS BY JAPAN; SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE WITHIN JAPAN; THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE AND OFFENCES, CAUSED BY RUSSIA AND RUSSIAN TROOPS ON UKRAINIAN TERRITORY. JAPAN ALSO STRIVES TO PREVENT TERRITORIAL CONFLICTS IN THE FAR EAST, AND IF SUCH CONFLICTS OCCUR, TOKYO INTENDS TO ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF WESTERN COUNTRIES, WITH WHICH IT IS APPLYING SANCTIONS PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. THE ARTICLE REVEALS THE ACTIVITY OF JAPAN, DIRECTED TOWARDS SUPPORTING UKRAINE IN VARIOUS MULTILATERAL FORMATS. THROUGHOUT 2022, IN COOPERATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WITHIN THE G7, JAPAN CONSISTENTLY IMPOSED SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA. IN OTHER CASES JAPAN DIRECTED ITS EFFORTS TOWARDS INFLUENCING THE OPINIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE DIALOGUE REGARDING THE WAR. IN PARTICULAR, AT THE UN LEVEL JAPAN TOOK PART IN DRAFTING RESOLUTIONS CONCERNING THE CONDEMNATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AND IN COOPERATION FORMATS SUCH AS ASEAN + JAPAN, G20, APEC ETC., IT FOCUSED ON RHETORIC, EMPHASIZING THE ILLEGAL NATURE OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE AND THE NECESSITY OF EXERTING PRESSURE ON THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION BY THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
804	GIVEN THE NUMBERS DISPLACED AS PART OF THE MEANS AND METHODS OF THE ARMED CONFLICT DURING THE WAR IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA BETWEEN 1992-95, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE RETURN PROCESS HAS BEEN LONG AND DRAWN OUT. NEVERTHELESS, A REMARKABLE PROCESS OF POST-WAR RECONCILIATION HAS QUIETLY DRAWN TO COMPLETION IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA. IN LESS THAN A DECADE AFTER THE END OF THE WAR, OVER 90 PER CENT OF THE 211,871 CLAIMS FOR THE RESTITUTION OF REAL PROPERTY MADE BY INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) AND REFUGEES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. ANNEX 7 OF THE DAYTON AGREEMENT, THE AGREEMENT ON REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS, PROVIDED FOR THE RETURN OF IDPS AND REFUGEES, BUT IT WAS THE OBJECT OF OBSTRUCTION IN THE MID TO LATE 1990S. HOWEVER, BY THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST DECADE OF THE 21 ST CENTURY, RESTITUTION WAS ALL BUT COMPLETE. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS TURN-AROUND EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BOSNIANS WHO BENEFITED DIRECTLY. IT IS A MODEL, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, FOR THE RESOLUTION OF MANY OTHER CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD IN WHICH LAND IS A MAJOR ISSUE. WHILE A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DRAMATIC ACCELERATION OF THE RESTITUTION PROCESS IN BOSNIA, CERTAINLY THE UNEXPECTED STAYING POWER -AND, INDEED, CONCERTED ACTION ON PROPERTY RESTITUTION-OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PLAYED ITS PART. A 'CARROT AND STICK' STRATEGY MANIFESTED ITSELF IN HIGH-PROFILE FUNDING, ADMITTANCE TO INTERNATIONAL BODIES, AND THE REMOVAL OF OBSTRUCTIVE OFFICIALS. AS THIS PAPER SHALL ARGUE, THE GREATEST FACTOR IN SEEING THE PROCESS THROUGH TO THE END WAS THE SHIFT FROM A PROCESS THAT FOCUSED PRIMARILY UPON ETHNICALLY-LINKED 'RETURN', SOMETIMES AT THE EXPENSE OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, TO ONE THAT WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE RECOGNITION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS WAS POSSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. UNIQUELY, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CONVENTIONS WERE INCORPORATED DIRECTLY INTO POST-WAR BOSNIAN DOMESTIC LAW. INFLUENCED BY THIS, LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES IN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY PROGRESSIVELY SLANTED THE PROCESS IN FAVOUR OF SIMPLE, ALMOST INTUITIVE, RIGHTS RECOGNITION. SHIFTING AWAY FROM THE EMPHASIS ON 'RETURN' REMOVED A SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT FROM IMPLEMENTATION AND, COMBINED WITH GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE 'RULE OF LAW', NARROWED THE SCOPE FOR THE SYSTEM TO BE MANIPULATED AND THWARTED. THIS, THEREBY, DE-POLITICISED RESTITUTION.
805	DESPITE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE, AFGHANISTAN CONTINUES TO GRAPPLE WITH DAUNTING RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES. CORRUPTION REMAINS A GNARLY OBSTACLE, WITH THE JUSTICE SECTOR ESPECIALLY MIRED IN GRAFT. A FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM CONTRIBUTING TO THE JUSTICE SECTOR WOES HAS BEEN THE DEFICIENT STATE OF THE LEGAL EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE OUTDATED AND BIFURCATED MODEL OF AFGHAN LEGAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN LARGELY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE REALITIES OF THE EVOLVING AFGHAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE PRESSING NEEDS OF THE WIDER JUSTICE SECTOR. IN THE MIDST OF THE DOOM AND GLOOM, HOWEVER, A QUIET, METHODICAL, AND RADICAL APPROACH TO LEGAL EDUCATION HAS BEEN UNFOLDING AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF AFGHANISTAN (AUAF) FOR THE PAST DECADE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES AUAF 'S BACHELOR OF ARTS AND LAWS (BA-LLB) PROGRAM IN DETAIL AND PARSES ITS EVOLUTION, INCLUDING SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES, IN DEVIATING FROM THE TRADITIONAL AND FLAWED APPROACH TO LEGAL EDUCATION IN AFGHANISTAN. IN SETTING THE CONTEXT, THE ARTICLE WILL FIRST PROVIDE BRIEF OVERVIEWS OF THE AFGHAN LEGAL EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED AUAF. THE ARTICLE WILL THEN TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO THE VARIOUS FACETS OF THE AUAF LAW PROGRAM, INCLUDING ITS EARLY DAYS, LEGAL STUDIES CERTIFICATE PROGRAM, BA-LLB PROGRAM DESIGN, EMPHASIS ON LEGAL PLURALISM, AND INNOVATIVE TEACHING MATERIALS. IT WILL ALSO EXPLORE OTHER KEY ASPECTS INCLUDING THE LANGUAGES OF INSTRUCTION, FACULTY, PROGRAM MONITORING AND EVALUATION, PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH, LEGAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, AND STUDENTS. WITH ONLY FOUR COHORTS OF BA-LLB GRADUATES, THE PROGRAM IS STILL RELATIVELY NASCENT. A NUMBER OF CONCRETE MEASURES ARE NEEDED TO CONSOLIDATE THE LAW PROGRAM AND INCREASE ITS IMPACT. THESE INCLUDE EXPANDING THE CURRICULUM AND TEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, FURTHER EMPHASIZING PRACTICAL LEGAL EDUCATION, AND INCREASING COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AFGHAN INSTITUTIONS. RUSHING GRADUATE PROGRAMS, WHILE REINFORCEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION BECKON, WOULD BE PREMATURE. IN EMERGING AS A SUCCESSFUL AND INNOVATIVE MODEL FOR LEGAL EDUCATION IN AFGHANISTAN, THE PROGRAM HAS BENEFITTED FROM A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AT VARIOUS LEVELS TO TRULY OWN, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENT ITS CURRICULAR AND PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, THE PROGRAM'S EMPHASIS ON A GRADUAL AND INCREMENTAL APPROACH TOWARDS GROWTH, GROUNDED IN THE REALITIES OF AN EVOLVING CONTEXT, HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO ITS SUCCESS. IN THE QUEST TO REVAMP THE JUSTICE SECTOR, THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AUAF LAW PROGRAM MAY SHED LIGHT ON LONG-TERM AND COST-EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TOWARDS IMPROVING LEGAL EDUCATION AND, IN TURN, THE RULE OF LAW IN AFGHANISTAN AND OTHER POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES.
806	ON FEBRUARY 26, 2016, PRC LAW ON THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES IN DEEP SEABED AREAS WAS ADOPTED. AS A LANDMARK MARINE LEGISLATION, THIS LAW WAS FORMULATED IN LINE WITH THE UNCLOS, THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITY, AND THE PRC CONSTITUTION. IT OPENED A BRAND NEW ERA OF MARINE DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION FOR CHINA UNDER THE STRATEGIC BACKGROUND OF MARITIME POWER. FACING THE LIMITATION AND CHALLENGES ABOUT THE ECOSYSTEM AND RISK PREVENTION BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE UNCLOS AND THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY 1992, THE MARITIME POWERS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CHINA, HAVE BEEN MAKING DOMESTIC LEGISLATION ON THE EXPLOITATION AND PROTECTION OF SEABED RESOURCES BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES CHINA'S POLICY FOR THE EXPLOITATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 'AREAS' IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNCLOS, AND MAKES A FURTHER INTERPRETATION ON CHINA'S RELATED DOMESTIC LEGISLATIONS AND PRACTICE.
807	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CALVIN'S UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF RADICAL POLITICAL CHANGE DURING THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT CALVIN HAD AN ORGANIC UNDERSTANDING OF CHURCH, GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE. THESE THREE ENTITIES ARE INTERWOVEN AND INTERACT ON THE BASIS OF THE COVENANT AND CIVIL CONTRACT. CALVIN'S APPROACH, HOWEVER, IS NOT LIMITED TO THE COVENANT, BUT HAS A SURPRISING RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. HE INTEGRATED THEOLOGICAL, JURISTIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS IN HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE. IT IS FURTHER SHOWN THAT CALVIN'S HIGH REGARD FOR CIVIL GOVERNMENT, ENTRENCHED THE CORPUS CHRISTIANUM, EVEN THOUGH HE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN ECCLESIASTICAL AND CIVIL GOVERNANCE. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT CALVIN HAD A FUNDAMENTAL INFLUENCE ON MANY OF THE POLITICAL CONCEPTS WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED WITHIN MODERN DEMOCRACIES.
808	IN MANY WAYS, PANAMA HAS COME INTO ITS OWN. ITS RUNNING OF THE PANAMA CANAL IS INDISPUTABLY SUCCESSFUL, ITS POST-NORIEGA ELECTIONS APPEAR TO BE RELATIVELY CORRUPTION FREE, THE MULTIBILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION OF THE CANAL AND THE MODERNIZATION OF ITS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM ARE IN FULL SWING-ALL OSTENSIBLY SIGNS OF A DEVELOPED COUNTRY, BUT APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING. DIG DEEPER, AND PERILS EMERGE: AN INCREASE IN GANGS AND DRUG TRAFFICKING, A HUGE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE WEALTHY AND THE POOR, AND AN EMERGING THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. EXAMINING THESE PERILS AND PROGRESS DEMONSTRATES THAT PANAMANIANS DO NOT YET ENJOY FULL CITIZENSHIP; INSTEAD, "CLIENT-SHIP" STILL DOMINATES.
809	DRAWING ON FIRST-HAND EMPIRICAL DATA, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW GUANXI DYNAMICS FACILITATE JUDICIAL CAREER MOBILITY IN CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. BASED ON THE VARYING PERCEPTIONS AND BEHAVIOURS OF JUDGES WITH RESPECT TO GUANXI, WE DISTINGUISH GUANXI DYNAMICS: THE DEFAULT OVERT-GUANXI AND THE EMERGING COVERT-GUANXI. IN THE FORMER, JUDGES PERCEIVE GUANXI AS BEING JUSTIFIED BY SOCIAL NORMS AND EMPLOY GUANXI PRACTICE OPENLY AND SOMETIMES ABUSIVELY. IN THE LATTER, JUDGES ADOPT A MORE PRUDENT ATTITUDE TOWARDS GUANXI AND EMPLOY IT IN A MORE DEVIOUS AND DECEPTIVE MANNER. THEY COMPLY WITH FORMAL PROCEDURES AND GRANT AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PROFESSIONALISM, WHICH DISGUISES GUANXI'S GENUINE INFLUENCE AND MAINTAINS FORMALISTIC LEGITIMACY. THESE DYNAMICS HAVE EVOLVED IN STEP WITH INCREASES IN MARKET COMPETITION, INSTITUTIONAL CERTAINTY AND POLITICAL CONTROL THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THE 2000S; THE COVERT-GUANXI MODE IS GRADUALLY SUPPLANTING THE OVERT-GUANXI MODE, ILLUSTRATING THE CONTINUED PERSISTENCE OF GUANXI IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA.
810	THROUGH INDIVIDUAL AND/OR COLLECTIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES AFFECTED BY DEMOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES, TOP MANAGERS SHAPE THE CORPORATE CULTURE AND DETERMINE THE OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS OF AN ORGANIZATION. THUS, TOP MANAGEMENT ATTRIBUTES AFFECT THE ADOPTION OF CRITICAL COMPANY-WIDE PRACTICES. THIS OPINION PAPER DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF, AND URGES ACADEMIC ATTENTION TO, THE ROLE PSYCHOLOGICAL CAPITAL PLAYS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOP MANAGER ATTRIBUTES AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GREEN ACCOUNTING PRACTICES ADOPTION IN A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) CONTEXT. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE ELABORATED UPON.
811	BASED ON KANT'S POLITICAL THOUGHT, THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A RULER'S POWER AND FREEDOM, LAW AND MORALITY. THE ASSUMED EXTERNAL FREEDOM IS TO BE GUARANTEED TO INDI-VIDUALS BY A VALID POLITICAL AUTHORITY (SOVEREIGN); HOWEVER, THE AUTHORITIES DO NOT HAVE TO OBEY THE LAW, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FREEDOM OF CITIZENS IS THREATENED. THUS, A TENSION APPEARS BETWEEN THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OBEDIENCE TO AN UNJUST LAW. FROM AN AUTHORITY'S PERSPECTIVE, PEACE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MORAL DEVELOPMENT, AND FROM A MORAL PERSPECTIVE, THE RULE OF LAW IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN ETHICAL PERFECTION. THIS LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM CAN BE JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF KANT'S ASSUMPTIONS, AS SOME LIBERAL INTERPRETATIONS OF KANT'S THOUGHT PROPOSE. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH THE REVOLUTIONARY MOMENT IS POSSIBLE WITHIN KANT'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, IT IS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THAN MOST LIBERAL AUTHORS POINT OUT AND HAS NO LINK TO THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF REVOLUTION.
812	WHY HAVE OUR SOCIETIES BECOME SO DEEPLY DIVIDED, WHICH IS INIMICAL TO DEMOCRACY? HOW DO GROWING DISTRIBUTIONAL CONFLICTS IMPACT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES? WHY DOES FAKE NEWS TAKE OFTEN PRECEDENCE OVER TRUTH? WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO AVERT THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDERMINED BY THE RULE OF THE MOB? IT MAY BE THAT THE CURRENT CRISES (PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC) ARE HARBINGERS OF A NEW TURNING POINT IN THE EVOLUTION OF CAPITALISM. THIS EVOLUTION IS INTERLOCKED WITH CYCLES OF IDEAS, OF PUBLIC POLICIES, AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. A MIXED ECONOMY TOOK SHAPE OVER TIME, IN WHICH A PUBLIC SECTOR AND A PRIVATE SECTOR COHABIT, BASED ON MARKET DYNAMISM, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WITH THE SHARES HELD BY THE TWO SECTORS SHIFTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH HISTORICAL AND LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE DEBATE THAT HAS STARTED AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS IS ABOUT THE PATH OF CAPITALISM, OF THE MIXED ECONOMY, OF DEMOCRACY. WE NEED TO STEER THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION VIA WISE POLICIES. SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY RELATES TO THE URGENCY TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT.
813	RESEARCH FINDS THAT PERSONAL EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE OR CRIME INCREASES POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. THE EFFECTS OF FEAR, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED. SINCE THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF BECOMING A VICTIM, THIS SUGGESTS AN IMPORTANT BUT UNEXPLORED CHANNEL FROM CRIME TO POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. MOREOVER, IF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE OR CRIME ARE ALSO AFRAID OF FUTURE EXPOSURE, EXISTING ESTIMATES CONFLATE THE EFFECTS OF PAST EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE OF FEAR OF FUTURE EXPOSURE. WE FOCUS ON AFRICA, WHICH HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HOMICIDES AND OTHER FORMS OF SERIOUS CRIMES. WE FIND THAT FEAR OF CRIME ACCOUNTS FOR 10%-23% OF THE EFFECT PREVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO DIRECT EXPOSURE. WE FURTHER FIND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF FEAR AND VICTIMISATION ON POLITICAL ATTITUDES. WHEREAS VICTIMS OF CRIMES HAVE MORE AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL ATTITUDES, PEOPLE WHO ARE FEARFUL OF CRIME ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY AND HOLD OTHER ATTITUDES THAT ARE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. VICTIMISATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER FOCUS ON IN-GROUP (ETHNIC) IDENTITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BROADER NATION.
814	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS HOW AN INTERVENING SECURITY FORCE CAN IMPLEMENT THE RELEVANT COMPONENTS OF THE SUITE OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS ON WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY (WPS). THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE PAPER IS A GENERIC OPERATIONAL CYCLE COMPRISED OF PRE-PLANNING, PLANNING, CONDUCT, AND TRANSITION. SPECIFIC TASKS IDENTIFIED IN THE RESOLUTIONS ARE ORGANISED IN THIS GENERIC OPERATIONAL CYCLE. THE TASKS ARE THOSE COMMONLY LED BY SECURITY FORCES, OR DIRECTED BY GOVERNMENT, AND INCLUDE: CONFLICT ANALYSIS OR INTELLIGENCE; DELIBERATE PLANNING; FORCE STRUCTURE; POPULATION PROTECTION; FEMALE ENGAGEMENT; SUPPORT TO THE RULE OF LAW; SECURITY SECTOR REFORM; AND DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILISATION AND REINTEGRATION. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THE AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE, WITH ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES FROM MILITARIES OF CANADA, IRELAND, SWEDEN AND THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS ORGANISATIONAL EXPERIENCES FROM NATO AND THE UNITED NATIONS. THE PAPER DRAWS ON OPERATIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN AFGHANISTAN, RWANDA, YUGOSLAVIA AND EAST TIMOR. OVERALL, THE PAPER MAKES A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO THE MILITARY OPERATIONALISATION OF THE WPS AGENDA.
815	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE ROMAN INQUISITION IN MALTA DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHEN MUCH OF ITS SEVERITY HAD DECLINED. IT PRESENTS EVIDENCE FROM PRIMARY SOURCES IN MALTA'S INQUISITORIAL ARCHIVES TO DOCUMENT UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE MALTESE TRIBUNAL AND, IN THE PROCESS, DEMOLISHES VARIOUS MYTHS ABOUT THIS INSTITUTION. IT PROVES THAT MOST OF THE CHARGES RESULTED FROM SELF CONFESSIONS AND THAT THE ACCUSED WOULD BE ARRESTED ONLY AFTER A PROLONGED INVESTIGATION. THOUGH HE WAS NOT SUPPLIED WITH THE NAMES OF HIS ACCUSERS THESE DID CROP UP DURING INTERROGATION. THEY WERE ALSO TO BE FOUND IN THE TRANSCRIPT THAT A DEFENDANT WAS GIVEN TO PREPARE HIS DEFENSE WITH AND HE WAS EVEN ABLE TO CONFRONT HIS ACCUSERS FACE TO FACE. THE DEFENDANT WAS PERMITTED TO HAVE A LAWYER TO ASSIST HIM AND COULD BRING HIS OWN WITNESSES. JUDICIAL TORTURE WAS RARELY USED AND SENTENCES WERE DECIDED WITH MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION SO THAT THE INNOCENT WOULD NOT BE PUNISHED. IT IS MORALLY INCORRECT TO CONDEMN LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE BUT IT MUST BE SAID THAT THE ROMAN INQUISITION FOLLOWED THE RULE OF LAW.
816	SPAIN AND MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE GOING THROUGH A CRITICAL STAGE THAT ENDANGERS THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF CIVILIZATION AND PROTECTION OF SOCIAL RIGHTS WHICH ARE THE STANDARD OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THE EMERGENCE OF THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS IMPACT ON MEMBER STATES, ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHTS AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE SOCIAL ONES, IMPOSE A CRITICAL REFLECTION SINCE ON THE EUROPEAN SCENE THERE IS NOT A SHARED CONCEPT. IN THE SPANISH SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, MANY OF THE SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE PLACED IN CHAPTER III OF TITLE I AS GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICY. THE ANALYSIS OF THIS REGULATORY BODY OF THE CONSTITUTION IS PROBLEMATIC INSOFAR AS IT RAISES THE PROBLEM OF REDIRECTING THE CONTENT OF SUCH RULES TO LEGAL STRUCTURES IN ORDER TO ENSURE GUARANTEE LEVELS WHICH APPROXIMATE THEM TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A EUROPEAN MODEL OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY. THE PROBLEM OF THE WELFARE STATE (IN SPAIN AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES) AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.
817	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE SCEPTICISM THAT HAS HAUNTED THE DEBATE OVER THE EXTENT TO WHICH FUDGES AND JUDICIAL METHODS CAN OR SHOULD ACCOMMODATE CONTESTED VALUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. IN SO DOING, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS BRIEFLY CERTAIN CULTURAL THEORIES ASSOCIATED WITH JEAN-FRANCOIS LYOTARD, JACQUES DERRIDA AND IN PARTICULAR; MICHEL FOUCAULT. EYEING POSTMODERN THINKERS, BROADLY SPEAKING, THEY REFLECT ESTABLISHED VALUES, OPPOSING WHATEVER THEY CONSIDER TO BE AUTHORITARIAN AND INSTEAD, ENCOURAGE RELATIVISM AND PLURALISM. THE AUTHOR THEN LOOKS AT THE CHARGE THAT OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS REFLECT AND IMPLEMENT ARBITRARY GOVERNANCE BY EXAMINING WHAT ''SOVEREIGNTY" REALLY MEANS IN AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY AND, BEFORE THAT, ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY. THE SLITHER CONCH IDES BY EXPLORING FACTORS WHICH BEAR ON JUDGING AND JUDICIAL METHOD. GROUPED AS INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. PRINCIPLES AND DOCTRINES AND PROCEDURAL MATTERS, AND PROPOSES THAT IF THE DISCUSSED SCEPTICISM IS TO BE DIRECTED TO THE EXERCISE OF REASON IN JUDICIAL METHOD OR TO THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW, IF WOULD NEED TO HAVE A GREATER APPRECIATION OF OUR PAST AND THE BALANCES DEVELOPED IN OUR SYSTEM DESIGNED TO COUNTER ARBITRARY GOVERNANCE.
818	MAKING A FIRST SKETCH OF PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES ARISING FROM EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW I WANT TO PRESENT A SERIES OF MORE OR LESS OBVIOUS, AND MORE OR LESS INTERRELATED DILEMMAS, OR EVEN 'DOUBLE BINDS'. (I) DEEPENING THE COMMUNITY BECOMES INCOMPATIBLE WITH WIDENING MEMBERSHIP. (II) NATIONAL STATES SEEM BOTH NECESSARY FOR AND OBSTRUCTIVE IN ARTICULATING TRANSNATIONAL PROBLEMS. (III) THE MORE DEMOCRACY IS NEEDED AS A WARRANT FOR THE PUBLIC EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER IN EUROPE, THE MORE THE VERY CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY ON A EUROPEAN SCALE EVADES UNDERSTANDING. (IV) EUROPEAN UNITY PRESUPPOSES A UNIFYING RULE OF LAW, WHILE MEMBER STATES HAVE RADICALLY DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF THIS PRINCIPLE. (V) EVEN THE VERY CORE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, THE COMMON MARKET, IS SUBJECT TO TWO CONFLICTING AND, INDEED, INCOMPATIBLE DOCTRINES OF COMPETITION. IN EXPLAINING THE NATURE OF EACH DILEMMA I WILL TRY TO TAKE MY CUE FROM THE MAASTRICHT TREATY WHEREVER THIS SEEMS SUITABLE. THEN I WILL ELABORATE ON THE JURISPRUDENTIAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN IT. FINALLY, EACH SECTION WILL BE CLOSED BY AN ATTEMPT TO STATE THE NATURE OF THESE PROBLEMS IN PHILOSOPHICAL TERMS.
819	THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC POWER. IN INTERPRETING THIS PRINCIPLE, THE LITHUANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS DEFINED IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONING OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH REQUIRES NOT ONLY SEPARATION OF THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO ENSURING A BALANCE BETWEEN THEM. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE STATING THAT 'IN LITHUANIA, STATE POWER IS EXECUTED BY THE SEIMAS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE JUDICIARY' IS THE STARTING POINT FOR REVEALING THE CONTENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL POWERS BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES SPECIFIED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND PRESENTS SOME CASES OF VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS THAT HAVE BEEN EXAMINED BY THE LITHUANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THESE ISSUES ARE ANALYZED IN THE CONTEXT OF CHALLENGES TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IN OTHER CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
820	RESEARCH HAS INDICATED LIMITED EFFECTS OF FORMAL GOVERNANCE MEASURES ON SECURITIES FRAUD PREVENTION IN EMERGING MARKETS DUE TO THE WEAK RULE OF LAW. WE PROPOSE THAT HIERARCHICAL INCONSISTENCY, MISALIGNED RANK ORDERING IN FORMAL ORGANIZATIONAL AND INFORMAL SOCIAL HIERARCHIES OF THE CORPORATE ELITE, CAN PROVIDE A NOVEL MONITORING MECHANISM TO REDUCE SECURITIES FRAUD. LEADERS AT THE TOP OF THE TWO INCONSISTENT HIERARCHIES CAN FEEL DISTRESSED AND MOTIVATED TO ENGAGE IN CONTESTATION AND CHALLENGE EACH OTHER'S AUTHORITY, THUS PROVIDING CHECKS AND BALANCES AND PREVENTING GROUPTHINK. THIS MONITORING EFFECT IS LIKELY TO BE STRONGER WHEN EITHER OF THE TWO HEADS HAS DOMINANT AND UNEQUIVOCAL SUPERIORITY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HIERARCHY, MAKING THEM PARTICULARLY DISTRESSED BY THE HIERARCHICAL INCONSISTENCY AND PRONE TO CONTEST. WE TEST OUR ARGUMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLICLY LISTED FAMILY-CONTROLLED FIRMS IN CHINA, WHERE BUSINESS AND FAMILY HIERARCHIES MAY CONFER SUPERIORITY TO DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE CORPORATE SECURITIES FRAUD LITERATURE BY UNDERSTANDING HOW FORMAL ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES AND INFORMAL SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS INTERACT AND JOINTLY INFLUENCE GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS IN EMERGING MARKETS.
821	THIS STUDY IS ABOUT THE LEVEL AND FACTORS OF INFORMALITY CONCERNING THE FRESH MEAT MARKET IN THE PREFECTURE OF TIRANA-ALBANIA. SAMPLE DATA FOR 200 HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BEEN USED TO CARRY OUT THE STUDY. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, LINEAR AND LOGISTIC MULTINOMIAL ECONOMETRIC MODELING TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE LEVEL OF INFORMALITY IS 34%, WHILE ITS MAJOR FACTORS ARE THE LEVEL OF PRICE, AS WELL AS SAFETY AND QUALITY OF MEAT. OTHER DETERMINANTS ARE HOUSEHOLD'S INCOME AND CONSUMPTION QUANTITY AND INEFFECTIVE PUBLIC MONITORING SYSTEM, WHILE THE EDUCATION OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S HEADER SEEMS OF DUBIOUS EFFECT. IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE IMPROVING THE LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS AND THE TAX SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW TO PREVENT INFORMAL SELLING AND STIMULATE LEGAL TRADE. DESIGN AND MAINTAIN A PRO-POOR BUSINESS POLICY FOR A POSITIVE INVESTMENT CLIMATE ENCOURAGING EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME GENERATION IS A PRIORITY. RIGOROUS CONTROL OF PRODUCTION STANDARDS AND STIMULATION OF GOOD FARMING PRACTICES AS WELL AS IMPROVING DETECTION AND THE USE OF REPRESSIVE MEASURES WOULD BE SOME NECESSITIES BUT ALSO TOUGH CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE.
822	THE COUP THAT DEPOSED PRESIDENT JOAO MELCHIOR GOULART IN 1964 STARTED IN A 21-YEAR PERIOD OF PROFOUND RUPTURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW. POLITICAL RIGHTS WERE PERSECUTED, MANDATES ANNULLED, NEWSPAPERS CENSORED AND OCCUPIED. TORTURE AND REPRESSION BECAME THE FOCUS, EVEN THOUGH WE MAY FIND IMPORTANT FOCI OF RESISTANCE TO THE DICTATORSHIP. NATIONAL CONGRESS UNDERWENT A CLEANUP OPERATION AND SOME PARTIES - SUCH AS THE PARTIDO TRABALHISTA BRASILEIRO (PTB) - BECAME THE PREFERRED TARGET OF THIS PERSECUTION. IN THE STATES, THIS POLITICAL CLEANSING FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THAT OCCURRED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. GOVERNORS WERE DEPOSED, DEPUTIES AND COUNCILORS HAD THEIR MANDATES ANNULLED AND THE CIVIL SERVICE SUFFERED REPRISALS. POLITICAL DISPUTES THAT HAD BEEN CULTIVATED IN PREVIOUS YEARS TOOK ON A NEW SHAPE WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF CONSERVATIVE SECTORS. THIS WORK INTENDS TO ANALYZE THE POLITICAL DISPUTES AND RIVALRIES OBSERVED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 1964 COUP IN THE STATE OF AMAZONAS, STRESSING THE PROCESS IN WHICH GOVERNOR PLINIO RAMOS COELHO (PTB) WAS OVERTHROWN AND THE NEW GOVERNOR ARTHUR CESAR FERREIRA REIS TOOK OFFICE.
823	SOUTH KOREA HAS ACHIEVED UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN HISTORY. THIS COUNTRY, WHICH HAD BEEN AMONG THE POOREST IN THE WORLD UNTIL THE EARLY 1960S, BECAME ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING ECONOMIES BY THE MID-1990S AS DEMONSTRATED BY HIGH PER-CAPITA INCOME AND WORLD-CLASS INDUSTRIES. IN THE EARLY 1960S, KOREA HAD MUCH OF THE CHARACTERISTICS SHARED BY MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TODAY, SUCH AS PREVALENT POVERTY, LOW ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY, LOW LEVELS OF TECHNOLOGY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOCIETY, INSUFFICIENT CAPITAL, POOR ENDOWMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES, OVER-POPULATION IN A RELATIVELY SMALL TERRITORY, AND INTERNAL POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND EXTERNAL THREATS TO ITS SECURITY. KOREA HAS SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES AND ACHIEVED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A SINGLE GENERATION. KOREA'S SUCCESS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ELECTIVE DEMOCRACY BY THE 1990S. WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS? THIS ARTICLE, APPLYING A RECENTLY DEVELOPED THEORY OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT, EXPLORES THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS OF KOREA'S DEVELOPMENT AND DRAWS LESSONS FROM ITS SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT.
824	THIS PAPER STUDIES HOW INSTITUTION QUALITY, THROUGH THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDEX, AFFECTS PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION IN 17 COUNTRIES OF MENA REGION. BY TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT POOR GOVERNANCE LEADS TO HIGHER ACCUMULATION OF MENA PUBLIC DEBT OVER THE PERIOD, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ONLY THREE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUPPORT WELL THIS HYPOTHESIS. THESE VARIABLES ARE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE INDEX, REGULATORY QUALITY INDEX AND RULE OF LAW INDEX. MOREOVER, THE ESTIMATES SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INDIRECT IMPACT OF BAD GOVERNANCE OPERATING VIA DECREASED GDP GROWTH. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS OF THESE COUNTRIES WHICH ARE CURRENTLY FACING MAJOR FISCAL AND EXTERNAL IMBALANCES DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF WAR AND TERRORIST ATTACKS, LOW OIL PRICES AND A DECLINE IN TRADE. SOUND PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT REPRESENTS AN URGENT TASK ESPECIALLY THAT PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS OFTEN FIND THEIR ORIGINS IN THE LACK OF ATTENTION PAID BY POLICYMAKERS TO THE COSTS OF BAD GOVERNANCE AND WEAK MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT (C) 2017 ECONOMIC SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA, QUEENSLAND.

825	THIS PAPER PROPOSES A REALIST VERSION OF LIBERAL THEORY. REALIST LIBERALISM DENIES THAT SOCIETIES MUST (OR CAN) REST ON EVEN A THIN NORMATIVE CONSENSUS; DISBELIEVES IN REGULATIVE IDEALS; AND DECOUPLES LIBERAL POLITICS AND SOCIAL CRITIQUE FROM NEOKANTIAN PROJECTS OF RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION. DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM THE SCOTTISH RATHER THAN THE GERMAN ENLIGHTENMENT, IT FOCUSES INSTEAD ON INSTITUTIONAL DIVISIONS OF LABOR, UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES, AND THE FURTHERANCE OF HUMAN INTERESTS THAT ARE PARTLY COMMON AND PARTLY CLASHING. IT ANALYZES A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES -INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, THE MARKET, THE WELFARE STATE, COMPETITIVE REPRESENTATIVE AND PARTISAN DEMOCRACY, TOLERATION, AND FREE SPEECH -THAT REVEAL THEMSELVES IN PRACTICE TO SERVE A WIDE AND INDEFINITE VARIETY OF HUMAN INTERESTS. EACH OF THESE AND OTHER LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS ENABLE A PARTICULAR RANGE OF HUMAN PURPOSES. AND EACH MAY BE SUBJECTED TO NORMATIVE CRITIQUE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT EXCLUDES IMPORTANT SECTORS OF SOCIETY FROM ITS BENEFITS, IS UNFAIRLY RIGGED BY POWERFUL ACTORS, OR DISPLAYS SYSTEMATIC AND EXCESSIVE BIAS WITH REGARD TO THE RANGE OF INTERESTS IT PROMOTES.
826	EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES MUST PROVE THEIR RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR EU MEMBERSHIP. THE COMMISSION ADMINISTERS THEIR ACCESSION PROCESSES FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF CONDITIONALITY. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW DOMESTIC CONDITIONS AND DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE CONDITIONALITY PRINCIPLE AFFECT POLICY OUTCOMES. IT REVIEWS THE ARGUMENTS MADE IN THE LITERATURE ON EU CONDITIONALITY AND APPLIES THEM TO THE POLICY AREAS OF MINORITY RIGHTS AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN CROATIA AND MACEDONIA. BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE COMMISSION'S CONDITIONALITY WHILE THEIR DEMOCRATIC ACHIEVEMENTS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY. THEREBY, THE TWO COUNTRIES OFFER A FRUITFUL GROUND TO EVALUATE THE LESSONS DRAWN FROM THE 2004- 07 ENLARGEMENT. WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REMAINED QUITE UNCLEAR ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DOMESTIC AND EU- RELATED DETERMINANTS OF EFFECTIVE CONDITIONALITY, I ARGUE THAT DOMESTIC INFLUENCES VARY STRONGLY ACROSS THE RESEARCHED POLICY AREAS. IN COMPARISON, THE POLITICAL- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMMISSION SHOW CLEAR IMPACTS ON POLICIES IN CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. MATERIAL INCENTIVES OFFERED BY THE EU ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE EARLY PHASES OF THE ACCESSION PROCESS.
827	FOR RELATIONS AMONG INDIVIDUALS TO BE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND NOT BY THE "LAW" OF THE STRONGEST, THE "RES PUBLICA" MUST STAND TALL. THIS SUBORDINATION OF PRIVATE TO PUBLIC IS WHAT MAKES THE STRUCTURE OF LAW INTELLIGIBLE AND DEPENDABLE. IT IS THE WEST'S RESPONSE TO AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL SITUATION EXPERIENCED BY ALL HUMAN CIVILIZATIONS IN THEIR VITAL NEED TO METABOLIZE SOCIETY'S POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE BY REFERRING POWER TO AN ORIGIN WHICH BOTH LEGITIMATES AND LIMITS IT. THE CONTAINMENT OF INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS THUS NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON THE CONDITION OF THE RES PUBLICA WHICH IS THE BEARER OF WHAT ULPIAN CALLS "SACRED THINGS." THIS DOGMATIC FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN TAKEN UP ACROSS THE WORLD, IN STEP WITH WESTERN DOMINATION. BUT THIS MODEL IS BEING UNDERMINED BY WESTERN COUNTRIES THEMSELVES IN THEIR ASPIRATION TO FREE LEGAL SYSTEMS FROM THEIR DOGMATIC FOUNDATIONS AND INVERT THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE RELATION. IGNORANCE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF POWERS UNDERPINNING GOVERNMENT BY LAWS IS TAKING US BACK TO GOVERNMENT BY MEN, THAT IS, TO FEUDAL WAYS OF HYBRIDIZING THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE.
828	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION WITH EMPHASIS ON THE LOOSENING OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE REFLEXES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RETROGRESSION TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON THE INTANGIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CONCEPT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REGRESSION AND THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF PESTICIDES IN BRAZIL AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (RIGHT TO FOOD, HEALTH, ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT, AMONG OTHERS). THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES HOW THE LOOSENING OF LEGISLATIONS ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION. THUS, THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE STATE'S INVOLVEMENT AND ITS ACTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO GUARANTEE, PROTECT AND PRESERVE FUNDAMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. THE METHOD TO BE USED IS THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE, WITH THE REALIZATION OF A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CANNOT HAVE SETBACKS, BEING A LIMITER OF STATE
829	JOHANNES CHAN IS RENOWNED FOR ESPOUSING AND DEFENDING A LEGALIST VIEW OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO CONTRAST HIS LEGALIST THEORY OF JUDICIAL BEHAV-IOUR WITH THE STRATEGIC SCHOOL. USING FIVE ICONIC CASE STUDIES FROM THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY AS A DESCRIPTIVE CLAIM, THE LEGALIST SCHOOL DOES NOT REFLECT ACTUAL JUDICIAL PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE DISPUTES THAT MATTER. IT FURTHER ARGUES WHY, AS A NORMATIVE CLAIM, THIS LEGALIST ACCOUNT MAY NOT BE THE WISEST OPTION FOR JUDGES WHO SEEK TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AND THEIR INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY IN HONG KONG. IN CLOSING, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW CHAN'S THOUGHTS HAVE EVOLVED, WITH CHAN NOW SEEMINGLY ACCEPTING THAT THE STRATEGIC SCHOOL, AS BOTH DESCRIPTIVE AND NORMATIVE ACCOUNTS OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR IN HONG KONG, IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE CITY'S TURN TOWARDS AUTHORITARIANISM. IF WE READ CHAN CORRECTLY, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE HAS OVER TIME BECOME, IN SUB-STANCE, MORE SANGUINE ABOUT STRATEGIC JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING THAN HE ADMITS.
830	THE U.S. COURTS OF APPEALS DO NOT BEHAVE AS ONE; THEY HAVE DEVELOPED CIRCUIT-SPECIFIC PRACTICES THAT ARE PASSED DOWN FROM ONE GENERATION OF JUDGES TO THE NEXT. THESE DIFFERENT NORMS AND TRADITIONS (SOME WRITTEN DOWN, OTHERS NOT) EXIST ON A VARIETY OF LEVELS: RULES GOVERNING ORAL ARGUMENT AND THE PUBLISHING OF OPINIONS, EN BANC PRACTICES, SOCIAL CUSTOMS, CASE DISCUSSION NORMS, LAW CLERK DYNAMICS, AND EVEN SELF-IMPOSED CIRCUIT NICKNAMES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DESCRIBE THESE VARYING "CIRCUIT PERSONALITIES " AND THEN ARGUE THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY TO THE VERY SURVIVAL OF THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS. CIRCUIT-SPECIFIC NORMS AND TRADITIONS FOSTER COLLEGIALITY AND OTHER RULE-OF-LAW VALUES AND, IN SO DOING, SERVE AS A CRITICAL COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE PERNICIOUS NATIONALIZATION AND PARTISAN POLITICS OF FEDERAL JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. MAKING USE OF BOTH EMPIRICAL MEASURES AND INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH EIGHTEEN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS JUDGES, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW SAME-CIRCUIT APPEALS JUDGES FORGE A UNIQUE AND CONSEQUENTIAL BOND WITH EACH OTHER. THIS IS TRUE OF DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN APPOINTEES; IT IS TRUE OF
831	CHINESE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) PLAY A KEY ROLE NOT ONLY IN CHINA' DOMESTIC MARKET, BUT ALSO IN IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA (GOC)'S AMBITIOUS BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE. ACCORDINGLY, CHINESE SOES HAVE INCREASINGLY FALLEN BACK ON INVESTOR-STATE INVESTMENT ARBITRATION TO PROTECT THEIR INVESTMENTS IN HOST STATES. A RECURRENT ISSUE ARISING IN ARBITRAL PROCEEDINGS CONCERNS WHETHER CHINESE SOES SHOULD BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS IN VIEW OF THE CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN CHINESE SOES AND THE GOC. THIS ARTICLE SETS FORTH TWO ARGUMENTS. FIRST, APPLYING THE RELEVANT ILC ARTICLES TO CHINESE SOES, THE ARTICLE MAKES A LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR A CHINESE SOE TO BE DENIED STANDING AS A QUALIFIED CLAIMANT IN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION. SECOND, NOTWITHSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT CHINESE SOES IN THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE, THE ARTICLE MAKES A POLICY ARGUMENT THAT THE DENIAL OF CHINESE SOES' STANDING BEFORE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS IS NOT ONLY UNHELPFUL IN ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS, BUT ALSO UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT.
832	COLOMBIA'S TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROVISIONS FOR VICTIMS AND WOMEN IN PARTICULAR, HAVE ATTAINED GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE STATUS. WHAT WILL BE THE REAL IMPACT FOR VICTIMS OF THE CIVIL WAR? HOW CAN THE RULE OF LAW HELP COLOMBIA FIND THE ROADS TO JUSTICE? BASED ON A 2010-2014 IN-DEPTH, MULTI-METHOD STUDY OF THE LEGAL MOBILIZATION STRATEGIES OF DISPLACED WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS, WE ARGUE THAT THE EXAMINATION OF WOMEN'S TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE REDUCED TO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SOPHISTICATED AND CELEBRATED LEGAL AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK. WE SUGGEST THAT A POSSIBLE WAY OF DEVELOPING A MORE COMPLEX TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE NARRATIVE IS TO EXAMINE WHAT THE TURN TO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS A SHIFT FROM: BY HIGHLIGHTING THE TEMPORAL AND TEMPORARY ASPECTS OF LAWS, LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND LEGAL IDENTITIES IN THE COLOMBIAN ARMED CONFLICT, WE CAN ACHIEVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PREVIOUS LEGAL TRANSITIONS HAVE MEANT FOR THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF VICTIMS. WE SUGGEST THAT THIS APPROACH CAN BE USEFUL FOR DEVELOPING ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVES FOR APPRAISING HOW THE POST-CONFLICT FRAMEWORK PLAYS OUT FOR VICTIMS.
833	THE SWEDISH SOLUTION TO THE LEGAL HANDLING OF PROFESSIONAL CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL IN HEALTHCARE IS DESCRIBED. NO LEGAL RIGHT TO CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL FOR ANY PROFESSION OR CLASS OF PROFESSIONAL TASKS EXISTS IN SWEDEN, REGARDLESS OF THE RELIGIOUS OR MORAL BACKGROUND OF THE OBJECTION. THE BACKGROUND OF THIS CAN BE FOUND IN STRONG CONVICTIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE PROVISION AND RELATED CIVIC DUTIES, AND IDEALS ABOUT RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION. EMPLOYEE'S REQUESTS TO CHANGE WORK TASKS ARE HANDLED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS WITHIN THE FRAMES OF LABOUR LAW, ENSURING FULL VOLUNTARINESS, AND ALSO EMPLOYER'S PRIVILEGE REGARDING THE ORGANISATION AND DIRECTION OF WORK, AND DUTIES OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TWO COMPLICATING ASPECTS OF THIS SOLUTION RELATED TO THE INCLUSION OF 'ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL' SERVICE PROVIDERS IN A NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE, AND PROFESSIONAL INSISTENCE ON CONSCIENTIOUS REFUSAL RIGHTS TO ACCEPT LEGALISED ASSISTED DYING ARE DISCUSSED. THE LATTER IS FOUND TO UNDERMINE THE PRAGMATIC REASONS BEHIND RECENT ATTEMPTS BY PROLIFE GROUPS TO CHALLENGE THE SWEDISH SOLUTION RELATED TO LEGAL ABORTION IN COURTS.
834	PURPOSE - UNHAPPINESS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS THAT CAUSE POLITICAL UNREST IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) REGION IN RECENT YEARS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE MATTERS ON HAPPINESS IN THE MENA REGION WHILE CONTROLLING FOR OTHER RELEVANT DETERMINANTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER APPLIES PANEL RANDOM EFFECTS REGRESSION ANALYSES BY USING DATA FROM 14 MENA COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD OF 2009-2011. FINDINGS - THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT HIGHER LEVEL OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE HAPPINESS IN THE REGION. FURTHERMORE, THE PAPER FINDS THAT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION VARIABLES HAVE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH HAPPINESS BUT ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - MOST STUDIES IN THIS AREA COVER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. SINCE FINDINGS FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES MIGHT NOT BE DIRECTLY TRANSFERABLE TO EMERGING ECONOMIES SUCH AS MENA COUNTRIES, THEREFORE, MORE WORK IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE POLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF HAPPINESS IN THIS REGION.
835	THIS PAPER SITUATES THE CHALLENGES OF ETHICAL LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF METAPHYSICS. I ARGUE THAT THE CHALLENGES OF ETHICAL LEADERSHIP IN AFRICA ARE FUNDAMENTALLY METAPHYSICAL. THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE SOURCES OF METAPHYSICAL CONFLICTS IN AFRICA - THE CLAN, THE CULTS, AND RELIGION. TRAPPED BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE CLAN AND THE IDEALS OF THE MODERN STATE, AFRICAN LEADERS HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH COMPETING DEFINITIONS OF REALITY, COMPETING NOTIONS OF SOVEREIGNTY, CONFUSING CONCEPTS OF PERSONAL IDENTITY AND THE SUPREME BEING, CONFUSION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPACE, AND SO FORTH. THESE METAPHYSICAL CONFLICTS CAUSE WHAT I REFER TO AS SCHIZOPHRENIA IN LEADERSHIP LEADING TO A COMPROMISE IN HEALTHY ETHICAL BEHAVIOR. THE WAY OUT OF THIS UNHEALTHY ETHICAL CLIMATE IS A CONSCIOUS EFFORT BY LEADERS TO RECREATE THE STATE AND INCULCATE A NEW METAPHYSICAL WORLDVIEW THAT TRANSCENDS THE CULTIC METAPHYSICS OF THE CLAN. TO ACHIEVE THIS, I SUGGEST A HOLISTIC AND GLOBAL FOCUS IN LEADERSHIP TRAINING, EMPHASIS ON SOCIAL SECURITY, MASS EDUCATION, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW.
836	SCHOLARS AND JUDGES COMMONLY MAINTAIN THAT COURTS REQUIRE INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY IN ORDER TO BE AN EFFECTIVE INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT SUCH LEGITIMACY DEPENDS ON JUDGES MAKING LEGALLY PRINCIPLED, NEUTRAL DECISIONS. TWO PRINCIPAL WAYS JUDGES CAN SIGNAL THE NEUTRALITY OF DECISIONS ARE THE SIZE OF THE MAJORITY COALITION AND THE TREATMENT OF PRECEDENT: OPINIONS WITH LARGER MAJORITIES OR GROUNDED IN PRECEDENT PROJECT TO THE PUBLIC THAT THEY WERE DECIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THUS BASED ON IMPARTIAL DECISION-MAKING CRITERIA. WE USE AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN TO TEST WHETHER THESE TWO DECISION ATTRIBUTES INFLUENCE ATTITUDES TOWARD DECISIONS, PRESENTING INDIVIDUALS WITH MOCK NEWSPAPER ARTICLES REPORTING ON COURT DECISIONS IN WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY VARY MAJORITY COALITION SIZE AND TREATMENT OF PRECEDENT. OUR DATA SHOW THAT WHEN THE COURT PRODUCES A UNANIMOUS (RATHER THAN DIVIDED) DECISIONAL COALITION AND WHEN IT FOLLOWS (RATHER THAN OVERRULES) PRECEDENT, INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO AGREE WITH AND ACCEPT A DECISION, EVEN IF THEY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY PREDISPOSED TO DISAGREE WITH A GIVEN COURT OUTCOME.
837	PROPOSED AS AN ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY TO LIBERALISM, CONTEMPORARY REPUBLICANISM ARTICULATES A SYSTEMATIC THEORY OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION. DOES IT MAKE SENSE, HOWEVER, TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIBERALS AND REPUBLICANS ALONG THE LINES OF FREEDOM? THIS ARTICLE ANSWERS IN THE NEGATIVE, MAINTAINING THAT THE DISTINCTION IS PURCHASED AT THE COST OF MISDESCRIBING LIBERAL THEORY. FOCUSING ON THE WORK OF QUENTIN SKINNER AND PHILIP PETTIT, I MAINTAIN THAT THE MISCHARACTERIZATION TAKES PLACE AT TWO LEVELS. THE FIRST IS THE LINK THAT IS DRAWN BETWEEN THOMAS HOBBES AND CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY LIBERALS. THE SECOND HAS TO DO WITH REPUBLICANS' REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH LIBERAL FREEDOM TAKES ROOT AND IS MADE POLITICALLY DEFENSIBLE. THIS FRAMEWORK, I ARGUE, COMPRISES A CONSTELLATION OF OTHER CONCEPTS, SUCH AS CONSENT, PUBLICITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THAT ARE PART AND PARCEL OF LIBERAL FREEDOM. ONCE THESE FEATURES ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, WHAT EMERGES IS A VIEW OF LIBERALISM THAT MEANS SOMETHING LESS THAN BEING FREE FROM ANY AND ALL CONSTRAINTS, BUT WHICH ALSO MEANS SOMETHING MORE THAN BEING FREE FROM ACTUAL INTERFERENCE.
838	THIS PAPER USES A MULTI-EQUATION MODEL TO ACHIEVE AN OVERALL STUDY OF TWO KEY FACTORS WHICH EXPLAIN GROWTH, TECHNOLOGY AND INSTITUTIONS. THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE PROCESS OF THE ACCUMULATION OF THESE FACTORS AND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP ARISING AMONG THEM. A THEORETICAL MODEL IS GIVEN, TOGETHER WITH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE JOINT IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN A WIDE-RANGING SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1985 AND 1997. THIS PAPER ALSO CONTRIBUTES CERTAIN NOVEL ASPECTS IN THE VARIABLES EMPLOYED. THUS, AN INDICATOR OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND AN INDEX REFLECTING INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE BEEN USED. THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDICATOR CONSIDERS HEALTH, FORMAL EDUCATION, INFORMAL EDUCATION AND ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCE. IT EMBRACES A WIDER RANGE OF FACTORS THAN THE VARIABLES CONVENTIONALLY USED IN EMPIRICAL STUDIES. AS TO THE INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE INDEX, IT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED ON THE BASIS OF SIX INSTITUTIONAL SUB-INDICES, COMPRISING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THUS, THE INDEX CONSTRUCTED CAPTURES A GREATER WEALTH OF THE ITEMS CORNMONLY COVERED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSTITUTIONS.
839	BASED ON A LARGE CORPUS OF SPEECHES, INTERVIEWS, PUBLIC MEETINGS, WRITINGS, AND OTHER PRONOUNCEMENTS, THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE DISCOURSE OF THE LAST BRITISH HONG KONG GOVERNOR, CHRIS FATTEN, IN THE FIVE YEARS LEADING UP TO THE CHANGE OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER HONG KONG FROM BRITAIN TO CHINA, IN 1997. THE THESIS OF THE PAPER IS THAT IN ITS FOCUS ON FOUR ISSUES-THE FREE MARKET ECONOMY, THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRACY-EACH OF WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO HIGHLIGHT AN ASPECT OF WHAT FATTEN PROMOTED AS BRITAIN'S LEGACY TO I-LONG KONG, FATTEN'S DISCOURSE CAN BE CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF A MYTH CONCERNED WITH ENSURING THAT BRITAIN COULD WITHDRAW FROM ITS LAST MAJOR COLONY WITH HONOUR. THE PAPER ANALYSES FOUR DISCURSIVE STRATEGIES USED BY FATTEN IN THE PROMOTION OF HIS MYTH: THE TRANSFORMATION OF OLD POLITICAL GENRES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW ONES, PRESUPPOSITION, INVOLVEMENT (THE USE OF INDEXICALS), AND LEXICAL STRUCTURING AND REITERATION. AS SUCH, THE PAPER IS PRESENTED AS A CASE STUDY IN THE CREATION OF MYTHICAL DISCOURSE IN THE FIELD OF POLITICS.
840	THE TERM "MULTI-CRISIS" REFERS TO THE OCCURRENCE OF MULTIPLE CRISES SIMULTANEOUSLY, OFTEN STEMMING FROM GEOPOLITICAL RISKS. THESE RISKS CAN CAUSE SOCIETAL DISRUPTION AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY, AS EVIDENCED BY THE WATER CRISIS, STAGFLATION, COVID-19, POPULATION GROWTH, AND WARS. HENCE, IT IS CRITICAL TO MITIGATE GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AND PROMOTE PEACE. THESE RISKS CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. OUR STUDY FOCUSES ON HOW THE ABOVE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES CAN INFLUENCE THE OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY OF G20 ECONOMIES. WE MEASURE TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY (TFP) USING MALMQUIST (MPI) AND MALMQUIST-LUENBERGER (MLPI) PRODUCTIVITY INDICES WITH A BOOTSTRAP APPROACH. WE COMPARE THE TFP OF G20 ECONOMIES, DECOMPOSED INTO G7, BRICS, AND OTHER G20 COUNTRIES EXCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND FIND THAT ON AVERAGE, THE BRICS HAVE ACHIEVED HIGHER TFP THAN THE G7. THE G7 PERFORMANCE IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INNOVATION, WHILE THE BRICS PERFORMANCE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO CATCHING-UP ACTIVITIES. INTERESTINGLY, WEAKER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE PARADOXICALLY LINKED TO HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY PERFORMANCE IN THE G20.
841	THE NOTES I SHARE IN THIS ARTICLE ARE THE RESULT OF RESEARCH CONDUCTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DOCTORAL PROGRAM IN RULE OF LAW AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA. THIS RESEARCH, BASED ON A QUEER THEORETICAL-EPISTEMOLOGICAL APPROACH, SEEKS TO ANALYSE AND BRING TOGETHER THE SPANISH AND BRAZILIAN LEGAL OVERVIEWS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF TRANS RIGHTS, IN VIEW OF RECONSTRUCTING POLICIES THAT CONTEMPLATE THE DEMANDS OF TRANS MOVEMENTS. THE STARTING POINT FOR MY RESEARCH IS A DEPATHOLOGISING AND HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE. IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE, I PRESENT THE CONTENT OF MY INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS ITS DELIMITATION, OBJECT AND OBJECTIVES. THEN, I ADDRESS THE DIFFICULTIES THAT ARISE WHEN BRINGING A QUEER ANALYSIS CLOSER TO THE STUDY OF LEGISLATION, CASE LAW AND PUBLIC POLICIES - AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED FROM THAT. FINALLY, I PRESENT A SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS TO QUEER THE STUDY OF LAW; THAT IS, HOW TO COMBINE RESEARCH METHODS TO ENCOMPASS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES AND FAVOUR A TRANS/DISCIPLINARY DIALOGUE, AS WELL AS HOW TO EMBRACE EXISTING CONTRADICTIONS IN A CRITICAL LEGAL INVESTIGATION.
842	ALTHOUGH INSTITUTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR ACHIEVING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENTALLY ADJUSTED EFFICIENCY, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR BOTH. EMPLOYING A TWO-STAGE DOUBLE BOOTSTRAP DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS, THE PAPER FIRSTLY ESTIMATES THE BIAS-CORRECTED ENVIRONMENTALLY ADJUSTED SCORES FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION OVER THE PERIOD 2000-2018. THEY WERE THEN REGRESSED TO EXPLORE THE MAIN AND INTERACTION EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS ON EFFICIENCY BY USING A BOOTSTRAPPED-TRUNCATED REGRESSION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT UNLIKE BETTER PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS THAT BROUGHT EFFICIENCY GAINS, MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND LESS POWERFUL GOVERNMENT UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED ENVIRONMENTALLY ADJUSTED EFFICIENCY. A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT BETWEEN POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS SLIGHTLY REINFORCED THE FAVORABLE EFFECT OF THE FORMER AND DECREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LATTER ON EFFICIENCY. THE RESULTS PROVIDE A NEW EMPIRICAL INSIGHT INTO THE ONGOING DEBATE ON THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION-DRIVEN CHANGES IN AN ECONOMY.
843	THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE POLITICAL CRISIS THAT HAS UNFOLDED IN VENEZUELA (AROUND THE COMPETING CLAIMS TO THE PRESIDENCY BY JUAN GUAIDO AND NICOLAS MADURO), IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS THAT HAVE ENABLED THAT CRISIS. THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT VENEZUELA PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF "SELF-NEGATING CONSTITUTIONALISM." A SELF-NEGATING CONSTITUTION IS ONE THAT, BY NEGATING ITS OWN POSITION AS THE EXCLUSIVE, SELF-CONTAINED SOURCE OF DEMOCRATIC AUTHORIZATION FOR A GIVEN POLITY, ULTIMATELY CEASES TO SERVE AS THE LAST INSTANCE FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF INSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS, INCLUDING CONFLICTS ABOUT THE PROPER LOCUS OF REPRESENTATION OF THE "SOVEREIGN" DEMOS, THEREBY UNDERMINING THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REPLACING THE RULE OF LAW WITH EXTRALEGAL POWER AS THE MECHANISM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF POLITICAL DISPUTES. AS THE PAPER WILL SHOW, THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT THE VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTION HAS DONE BY OUTSOURCING THE COMPETENCY TO "TRANSFORM THE STATE" TO AN INSTITUTION SUPPOSEDLY AUTHORIZED BY THE PEOPLE'S "ORIGINAL CONSTITUENT POWER."
844	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT POLITICAL STABILITY WAS THE MAIN PARADIGM OF THE UN ADMINISTRATIVE MISSION IN KOSOVO (UNMIK). UNMIK HAS PURSUED THIS GOAL AT THE EXPENSE OF DEMOCRATIZATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND A CLEAR VISION FOR KOSOVO. AN INSISTENCE ON WORKING WITH LOCAL POLITICAL ELITES WITH THE AIM OF MAINTAINING STABILITY HAS GREATLY EMPOWERED THESE ELITES, AT THE COST OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. AS A MISSION THAT HAS OPERATED WITH AN OPEN-ENDED MANDATE AND WITHOUT AN EXIT STRATEGY, UNMIK CO-OPTED THE LOCAL POLITICAL ELITES AND GAVE TACIT APPROVAL TO THEIR CLIENT-PATRON LOGIC OF GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTIVE AFFAIRS IN EXCHANGE FOR ACHIEVING WHAT WE CALL "NEGATIVE STABILITY" AND POSTPONING A FINAL RESOLUTION OF KOSOVO'S POLITICAL STATUS. IN THE PERIOD FOLLOWING THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE AND EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX) DEPLOYMENT, THE SAME POLITICAL ELITES CONSOLIDATED THEIR POWER AND CONTINUED TO BUILD THEIR CLIENTELIST NETWORKS AND AVOID PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT DESPITE MASSIVE INVESTMENTS, EULEX, LIKE UNMIK, HAS PRIORITIZED STABILITY AT THE COST OF DEMOCRATIZATION.
845	STATE CAPTURE IS A FORM OF INSTITUTIONALIZED PARTICULARISM WHEREBY ELITE ACTORS MANIPULATE POLICY FORMATION TO THEIR OWN MATERIAL AND POLITICAL INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD. IN KOSOVO, A COMPETITIVE FORM OF STATE CAPTURE EMERGED DURING THE POSTWAR PERIOD AS THE COUNTRY'S MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES FIERCELY COMPETE FOR CONTROL OVER STATE SPOILS. WHAT MAKES THE CASE OF STATE CAPTURE IN KOSOVO STAND APART FROM MOST COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IS THE EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION OF KOSOVO'S STATE-BUILDING PROCESS. THIS RAISES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION: GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS OF INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION AND THE STRENGTHENING OF STATE INSTITUTIONS, HOW HAS CORRUPTION BECOME INCREASINGLY PERVASIVE IN KOSOVO UNDER INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION? THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT THE STABILITY PARADIGM HAS DRIVEN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE CREATED CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO STATE CAPTURE, WHICH INDIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION IN KOSOVO. THE WEST'S CHOICE OF STABILITY AND SECURITY OVER DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW WILL HAVE LONG-TERM AND ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR KOSOVO'S STATE FORMATION.
846	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE STUDY THE EMERGENCE OF AN EXTRACTIVE INSTITUTION THAT HAMPERED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ITALY FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY: THE SICILIAN MAFIA. SINCE ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE LATE 1800S, THE REASONS BEHIND THE RISE OF THE SICILIAN MAFIA HAVE REMAINED A PUZZLE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARGUE THAT THE MAFIA AROSE AS A RESPONSE TO AN EXOGENOUS SHOCK IN THE DEMAND FOR ORANGES AND LEMONS, FOLLOWING LIND'S DISCOVERY IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THAT CITRUS FRUITS CURED SCURVY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE CLAIM THAT MAFIA APPEARED IN LOCATIONS WHERE PRODUCERS MADE HIGH PROFITS FROM CITRUS PRODUCTION FOR OVERSEAS EXPORT. OPERATING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW, THE MAFIA PROTECTED CITRUS PRODUCTION FROM PREDATION AND ACTED AS INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND EXPORTERS. USING ORIGINAL DATA FROM A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IN 1881-1886 ON SICILIAN TOWNS, THE DAMIANI INQUIRY, WE SHOW THAT MAFIA PRESENCE IS STRONGLY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION OF ORANGES AND LEMONS. THE RESULTS HOLD WHEN DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES AND SEVERAL CONTROLS ARE EMPLOYED.
847	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE CHINESE SOCIETY IN THE QING DYNASTY THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVE OF VALUE RATIONALITY, AND THE PURPOSE IS TO REVEAL THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE QING DYNASTY IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE TIME, IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF CAPITALISM EMERGE OF ITSELF AND PERISH OF ITSELF THAT IS GIVEN HERE WHY HAS NOT BEEN A COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCURATE STATEMENT. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT: BECAUSE OF THE BELIEF THAT THE SOCIETY IN THE QING DYNASTY HELD THE THE LIFE BELIEF OF PRACTICAL REASON(VALUE REASON). THE WHOLE SOCIETY WAS SHOWING TAKING HUMAN CENTER, BASING ON THE PRESENT, AND THE LACK OF THE SPIRIT OF THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATTENTION TONE. SO THAT THE SOCIETY IS FULL OF SUCH AS ENJOYING PLEASURE IN GOOD TIME, AND THE RULE OF LAW AND GENERALLY APPEARING IN CONSISTENT THAN OTHER ASPECTS OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF THE PATRIARCHAL ETHICAL SPIRIT OF SOCIAL HISTORICAL PHENOMENON. THESE PHENOMENA WERE RELATED TO THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AT THAT TIME.
848	INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE, LIKE ALL CONTEMPORARY MODES OF GOVERNANCE, INCREASINGLY OPERATES BY MEANS OF QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS. ISSUES SUCH AS CORRUPTION, THE RULE OF LAW, ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE GENERALLY TRANSLATED INTO NUMBERS AND INDICATORS. AS QUANTIFICATION BECOMES EVER MORE CENTRAL TO GOVERNANCE, IT IS CRITICAL TO EXAMINE THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS WITHIN WHICH MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS ARE DEVELOPED. A COMPARISON OF FOUR CULTURAL APPROACHES TO MEASURING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN GLOBALLY SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN WHAT IS MADE VISIBLE AND WHAT IS DISAPPEARED IN EACH ONE. MOREOVER, THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN POWER AND RESOURCES. THOSE GENERATED BY BETTER RESOURCED ORGANIZATIONS COME TO DOMINATE THE DEFINITION OF A PHENOMENON, SUCH AS VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND THE WAY IT IS UNDERSTOOD. ULTIMATELY, THIS SHAPES THE WAY IT IS GOVERNED. SINCE REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE DEPEND ON WHAT QUANTITATIVE DATA MAKES VISIBLE, THESE SLIPPAGES HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER MASSON SAS.

849	MANY CITIZENS OF OUR PUTATIVELY UNIFIED WORLD REGARD AS SERIOUS DISCOURSE, RATHER THAN AS SYMPTOMS OF IDEOLOGY, THE WEST'S POSTURING ABOUT ITS COLONIAL INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH. SCRUTINIZING THE CULTURAL MISSION OF SOME KEY IMPERIAL "MODERNIZERS", ONE FINDS THAT THE FIRST THREE BRITISH AUTHORS OF GRAMMARS OF BANGLA (A.K.A. BENGALI) MASSIVELY NEGLECTED THEIR LANGUAGE LEARNING RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRODUCED SHODDY WORK, WHICH THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COLLEAGUES UNCRITICALLY ADMIRED. ON THESE SHAKY FOUNDATIONS OF CULTURAL "KNOWLEDGE" THE BRITISH BUILT A "RULE OF LAW" WHOSE JUDGES, BEFORE THEY DESCENDED ON BENGAL, "STUDIED" ITS LANGUAGE AND CULTURE FROM "TEXTBOOKS" THAT REFLECTED THE LOW STANDARDS SET BY THEIR PREDECESSORS IN THE CULTURAL SECTOR OF THE COLONIAL ENTERPRISE. UNACCEPTABLE ASYMMETRIES IN CULTURAL STUDY CONTINUE TO THIS DAY. UNTIL A CRITICAL NUMBER OF WESTERN ACADEMICS MAKE AMENDS BY ATTAINING ADEQUATE PROFICIENCY IN THE LANGUAGES OF THE SOUTH AND MANIFESTING SUCH SERIOUS LITERACY IN THE WRITING THAT THEY INFLICT ON THEIR PUBLIC, THE CLAIM THAT WESTERN "ACADEMICS" HAVE ESTABLISHED ANY BIAS-FREE "SCIENCE" OF LANGUAGES, CULTURES OR SOCIETIES MUST BE DISMISSED AS PREMATURE.
850	ANNULMENT UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION OFFERS A LIMITED REMEDY ON THE BASIS OF A FEW CAREFULLY CIRCUMSCRIBED GROUNDS. RECENTLY, LOSING PARTIES HAVE ATTACKED AWARDS FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF REASONS. SOME AD HOC COMMITTEES DECIDING THESE REQUESTS FOR ANNULMENT HAVE TAKEN A BROAD VIEW OF THEIR POWERS. THEY HAVE GIVEN SOME GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT AN EXTREMELY WIDE INTERPRETATION THEREBY BLURRING THE LINE BETWEEN ANNULMENT AND APPEAL. FOR INSTANCE, A PERCEIVED MISTAKE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF A RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN REGARDED AS AN EXCESS OF POWERS FOR FAILURE TO APPLY THE PROPER LAW. ONE AD HOC COMMITTEE WENT BEYOND THE REASONS FOR ANNULMENT PUT FORWARD BY THE APPLICANT. IT ACTIVELY SEARCHED FOR ADDITIONAL GROUNDS AND EVENTUALLY ANNULLED THE AWARD FOR A REASON NOT RELIED UPON BY THE APPLICANT. SOME AD HOC COMMITTEES HAVE GONE BEYOND THE TASK GIVEN TO THEM BY THE ICSID CONVENTION, OFFERING GENERAL CRITICISM AND ADVICE TO TRIBUNALS. THE RISK THAT AN ICSID AWARD WILL BE ANNULLED IS NOW HIGHER THAN THAT A NON-ICSID AWARD WILL BE SET ASIDE BY A COMPETENT DOMESTIC COURT.
851	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DETERMINANTS OF FLOW OF FOREIGN AID IN THE 20 ASIAN COUNTRIES IN A PANEL FRAMEWORK. THE MODEL INCLUDES THE FOREIGN AID, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, SIX MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE, ALONG WITH THE PURELY ECONOMIC VARIABLES WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS CONTROL VARIABLES. ESTIMATION ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT BY USING POOLED ANNUAL TIME SERIES DATA FROM 2002 TO 2008 IN THE FRAMEWORK OF FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. RELEVANCE OF GMM (1991) AND GMM (1998) ESTIMATES WERE ALSO EVALUATED. WE FIND THAT THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IMPACT OF PAST YEAR'S AID FLOW AND REGULATORY QUALITY ON THE CURRENT YEAR'S AID FLOW WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE IMPACT OF EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES, POLITICAL STABILITY AND CONTROL OVER CORRUPTION ON THE CURRENT YEAR'S AID FLOW, WEAK EVIDENCE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF POPULATION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW ON THE CURRENT YEAR'S AID FLOW AND WEAK EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ON THE CURRENT YEAR'S AID FLOW.
852	ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION IS REDUCING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STATE BOUNDARIES. WE HAVE A GLOBAL ECONOMY BUT LACK THE INSTITUTIONS NECESSARY FOR A GLOBAL POLITY. UNILATERAL ACTION BY A WOULD-BE HEGEMON IS UNTENABLE IN THE LONG TERM AND HENCE THERE IS A NEED TO DISCUSS OUR INSTITUTIONS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF GLOBALIZATION HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED ASYMMETRICALLY, PLACING POOR PEOPLE IN POOR COUNTRIES AT A DISADVANTAGE, ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE FREE MOVEMENT OF LOW-SKILLED LABOUR AND THE CREATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, A TARGET OF THE CRITICS OF GLOBALIZATION, SHOULD BE SEEN AS A WELCOME EXTENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND A COUNTERWEIGHT TO UNILATERALISM. MORE GENERALLY, GLOBAL ECONOMIC LIBERALISM SHOULD BE BALANCED BY INSTITUTIONS WHICH PROVIDE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS AND INTERNATIONAL MECHANISMS TO FINANCE THEM. ALL OF THIS IMPLIES A FURTHER WEAKENING OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND A NEED TO ENSURE THAT GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS ARE DEMOCRATIC AND CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PEOPLE WORLDWIDE FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE.
853	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE WIDENING ECONOMIC GAP BETWEEN FRANCOPHONE AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, AND TO SUGGEST A STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT. IN MERELY THREE DECADES, SOUTH KOREA HAS MOVED FROM ECONOMIC OBSCURITY TO AN ECONOMIC POWER HOUSE AND HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR JOINING THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE WORLD ECONOMY. THIS BASIS COMPRISES AN EDUCATED POPULATION, A QUALITY CIVIL SERVICE, A SKILLED AND HIGH PRODUCTIVITY LABOUR FORCE, QUALITY AND COMPETITIVELY PRICED UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS, A DYNAMIC AND COMPETITIVE PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR, AN EFFICIENT NATIONAL BANKING SECTOR, AN EXPORT-LED GROWTH STRATEGY AND A SOUND MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK. GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE GRADUALLY TAKING HOLD. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SINGLE FACTOR: THE RESOLVE OF THE KOREAN LEADERS TO MOVE THEIR COUNTRY TO THE WORLD CENTRE STAGE. THE BASIC LESSON FROM THE KOREAN EXPERIENCE FOR AFRICA IS THAT ECONOMIC POVERTY CAN BE REVERSED QUITE RAPIDLY PROVIDED THAT THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP DISPLAYS AND MAINTAINS THE WILL AND THE VISION TO DO SO.
854	THE LOCAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS BUDGET REVIEW AND SUPERVISION IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO "EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD AND IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD" UNDER THE CHANGES OF THE CURRENT MAJOR CONTRADICTIONS. USING THE MULTI PERIOD DID METHOD, WE FOUND THAT AFTER THE REVISION OF THE REGULATIONS, THE LOCAL PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD PUBLIC SERVICE EXPENDITURE BIAS AND EXPENDITURE EFFICIENCY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. THIS CONCLUSION IS STILL VALID AFTER CONSIDERING A SERIES OF ROBUSTNESS TESTS AND POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS. THE SPECIFIC WAYS FOR IT MAINLY INCLUDE THE CONSTRAINT ON THE OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOR OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE SIGNAL TRANSMISSION FUNCTION OF THE LPC'S SUPERVISION. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MORE EFFECTIVE MEDIA ATTENTION, MORE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT RULE OF LAW ENVIRONMENT, GREATER FINANCIAL PRESSURE AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES CAN ALL AFFECT THE EFFECT OF LPC'S SUPERVISION OF SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THE RESEARCH CONCLUSION SHOWS THAT THE ROLE OF LPC SUPERVISION SHOULD BE FURTHER PLAYED TO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD AND PROMOTE THE CONSTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
855	THE FIVE NEW CENTRAL ASIAN STATES THAT EMERGED FROM THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION BEGAN A PROCESS OF STATE CAPACITY BUILDING AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR TERRITORIES. EVEN THOUGH EACH ONE HAS ITS PARTICULARITIES, THE CONTINUITY OF AUTOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS IS A COMMON FACTOR AMONG THEM. THE PRIVILEGED GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF CENTRAL ASIA AS A MANDATORY STEP BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA, AND ITS FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE ENERGY SECURITY OF WORLD GREAT POWERS, MAKE THE REGION INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT WITHIN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS OF THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. THIS MIGHT BE A FACTOR OF ANALYSIS THAT AFFECTS CHANGES AND CONFIGURATIONS IN THE POLITICAL ARENA. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXTERNAL FACTORS INFLUENCE DOMESTIC POLITICS BY DRAWING ON THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES AND DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, HISTORICAL LIAISONS AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS SECURITY AFFAIRS, INTERNATIONAL TRADE, INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN OIL AND GAS PIPELINES, AND COMPETENCE FOR SCARCE WATER RESOURCES IN THE REGION.
856	AT THE TIME OF WRITING, AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE, NAMED COVID-19, HAS SPREAD GLOBALLY, RESULTING IN THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. FOR THIS REASON, MORE THAN EVER IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW TO ALLOW GOVERNMENTS SUFFICIENT DISCRETION, FLEXIBILITY, AND POWERS TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCIES, SUCH AS COVID- 19, WHILE RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW. NOTABLY, THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS WHERE STATES CAN RESTRICT OR DEROGATE FROM CERTAIN HUMAN RIGHTS. YET, WHAT ARE THE MORAL PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD GUIDE DEMOCRACIES WHEN DEALING WITH THE LIMITATION OR SUSPENSION OF RIGHTS IN TIMES OF PUBLIC EMERGENCIES? THROUGH THE LENSES OF UTILITARIANISM AND LIBERALISM, THIS PAPER AIMED AT PROVIDING BOTH A LEGAL AND A PHILOSOPHICAL OVERVIEW OF THE LIMITATION, OR SUSPENSION, OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS - SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH OF THIS PAPER IS, THEREFORE, FUNDAMENTAL IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT SITUATION. IN OTHER WORDS, THE LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH OF THIS PAPER WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT CHALLENGES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DURING TIMES OF CRISIS. TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.
857	IN THIS ARTICLE I CONSIDER A PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH THE QUESTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY OCCUPIES A CENTRAL PLACE, NOT SO MUCH AS A REGULATOR OF THE INSTITUTIONS ON WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS BASED, BUT ABOVE ALL AS A CONCEPT THAT REGULATES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROTECTED BY THEM. ASSUMING THE PRISON CONTEXT AS A SUITABLE PLACE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT, I REFLECT ON THE ROLE OF VIOLENCE AS A MORAL (OR MORALISING) ELEMENT OF HUMAN DIGNITY IN ITS "HORIZONTAL APPLICATION". I INTEND TO REFLECT ON TWO INTERRELATED ASPECTS: ON THE ONE HAND, THE "SOCIALITY OF VIOLENCE", WHERE EACH INDIVIDUAL - VALUING DIFFERENTLY HIS ROLE AND STATUS IN THE INTERACTION - CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY A PERPETRATOR AND A VICTIM OF VIOLENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, MY REFLECTION TAKES UP THE IDEA OF A "CONTINUUM OF VIOLENCE", ACCORDING TO WHICH VIOLENCE PERMEATES AND CHARACTERISES INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE ACTION WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY THE CHANGE OF CONTEXT OR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS FIND THEMSELVES (IN THIS CASE, PRISON).
858	SOFT LAW IS A PUZZLE. IT SHAPES A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC DECISION MAKING, BUT ITS CONTENTS ARE SAID TO LIE BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE LARGELY UNCHARTED TERRAIN OF SOFT LAW IN CANADA. IT IS ORGANIZED IN THREE PARTS. PART I EXAMINES THE EXISTING TREATMENT OF SOFT LAW IN CANADIAN JURISPRUDENCE, INCLUDING SOFT LAW'S RELATIONSHIP TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONCEPTS SUCH AS THE STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS AND THE CONSTITUTION. PART II PROPOSES THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW FRAMEWORK TO CHARACTERIZE SOFT LAW, TERMED THE "SPECTRUM APPROACH." THIS APPROACH AIMS TO ASSIST COURTS IN RESPONDING TO THE INFLUENCE AND VARIATIONS OF SOFT LAW IN CANADIAN SOCIETY, AND TO BEGIN TO ASSESS SOFT LAW ON ITS OWN TERMS, RATHER THAN IN RELATION TO OTHER CONCEPTS. FINALLY, PART III APPLIES THE SPECTRUM APPROACH TO A CASE STUDY OF ONTARIO UNIVERSITY FREE SPEECH POLICIES. IN SUM, WE ARGUE THAT SOFT LAW IS A POWERFUL, PRACTICAL FORCE IN CANADIAN SOCIETY THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT BY THE COURTS.
859	SOME COUNTRIES REACHED, IN 2015, THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOAL OF REDUCING MATERNAL MORTALITY TO 96 OR LESS MATERNAL DEATHS PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS. OTHERS, HOWEVER, DID NOT. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE STRENGTH OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL MORTALITY AND EACH OF THE SIX COMPONENTS OF GOVERNANCE-A POLITICAL DETERMINANT SCARCELY EXPLORED IN THE LITERATURE-IN 174 COUNTRIES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE GREATER THE GOVERNANCE, THE LOWER MATERNAL MORTALITY, INDEPENDENTLY OF A COUNTRY'S WEALTH. WE USED ALL SIX INDICATORS OF THE WORLD BANKS WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS PROJECT IN 2015: GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE. FINDINGS WERE ENCOURAGING AS MATERNAL MORTALITY IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF MEDIUM-INCOME COUNTRIES WITH LOWER GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY. TO ACHIEVE THE POST-2015 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL ON PREVENTABLE MATERNAL MORTALITY-WHICH PERSISTS DESPITE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT-ALL GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS ARE ESSENTIAL AND REPRESENT INTERDEPENDENT CORNERSTONES.
860	IN THE LITERATURE ON SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR), THERE IS A DEBATE BETWEEN MAINSTREAM ANALYSTS OF POST-9/11 APPROACHES, WHO ARGUE THAT SECOND-GENERATION SSR (2GSSR) IS EMERGING IN SOME CONTEXTS, AND POST-COLONIAL CRITICS, WHO ARGUE THAT DESPITE DISCURSIVE CHANGES, WESTERN-DRIVEN, SECURITIZED PRACTICES STILL DOMINATE. THIS ARTICLE BRIDGES THOSE VIEWS, BUILDING ON LARZILLIERE'S (2016) IDEA THAT THE DIFFUSION OF GLOBAL POWER OFFERS SOUTHERN ACTORS ROOM FOR MANEUVER TO CONSTRUCT ALTERNATIVES TO FIRST-GENERATION SSR. GROUNDING THE DEBATE IN THE HAITIAN CASE, THE PAPER EXPLORES THE MIXED RECORD OF POLICE AND RULE OF LAW REFORM IN THAT RELATIVELY PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHILE SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE USED HAITI'S MARGIN FOR MANEUVER TO ADVANCE 2GSSR, POWERFUL ACTORS ARE PRIVILEGING NARROW SECURITY GOALS IN A POLITICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT THAT GREATLY CONSTRAINS THE CONSOLIDATION OF A NEW APPROACH. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SITUATING THE UNCERTAIN GAINS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE IN HAITI IN COMPARATIVE THINKING ABOUT THE UNEVEN PROSPECTS FOR 2GSSR IN DIVERSE FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES (FCAS).
861	INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW UNDERWENT A PROFOUND PARADIGM SHIFT DURING THE 1990'S AND INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AS A RESPONSE TO GLOBALIZATION, AND TO A LEGITIMACY CRISIS SPARKED BY UNRESOLVED STRUCTURAL ISSUES FROM THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT) ERA AND TENSIONS SURFACING IN GATT CASE LAW AROUND 'TRADE AND' ISSUES. INVESTMENT LAW TODAY IS UNDERGOING A SIMILAR LEGITIMACY CRISIS FOR SIMILAR REASONS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES AND INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION. WE ARGUE THAT INVESTMENT LAW IS RIPE FOR A SIMILAR PARADIGM SHIFT, AWAY FROM THE DOMINANT VIEW OF INVESTMENT LAW AS A PRIVATE ORDERING SYSTEM TO PROTECT CAPITAL, WITH ROOTS IN CONTRACT LAW AND COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION, AND TOWARDS RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT LAW TODAY IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE SYSTEM MEANT TO ENSURE JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ONE ASPECT OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS, THE ALLOCATION OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THIS PARADIGM SHIFT HAS NORMATIVE, STRUCTURAL AND DOCTRINAL IMPLICATIONS, WHICH WE EXPLORE, AND PROMISES TO HELP RESTORE LEGITIMACY TO INVESTMENT LAW AS IT ALSO IMPROVES SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES.
862	THE LISBON TREATY'S DEPILLARISATION OF JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS (JHA) COOPERATION REPRESENTS A MAJOR BREAK FROM THE PAST. IT OPENS THE WAY FOR THE FULL INVOLVEMENT OF THE COMMISSION, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, AN INVOLVEMENT THAT IS BOUND TO INFLUENCE THE SUBSTANTIVE SCOPE, AND PERHAPS LIBERALISE, LEGAL AND POLICY OUTPUT IN THE YEARS AHEAD. A DIFFERENT FORM OF COOPERATION IN AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE INSTITUTIONALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY IS DIGGING OUT ITS SPACE WITHIN THE PRESENT, SECURITY-ORIENTED AND TRADITIONALLY EXECUTIVE-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE. THE STOCKHOLM PROGRAMME AND THE PROPOSED ACTION PLAN ARE A REFLECTION OF THIS. PRESENT IN THEM ARE ASPECTS OF THE HAGUE PROGRAMME AND THE LOGIC OF CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE. BUT THERE ALSO EXIST VESSELS OF LESS IDEOLOGY-DRIVEN POLICIES, PRAGMATIC RESPONSES TO JHA CHALLENGES AND RESPECT FOR CITIZENS' RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHETHER THE LATTER PARADIGM, WHICH IS WRAPPED UP WITHIN THE LOGIC OF SECURITY, REMAINS CONFINED AND CRAMMED IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR WILL BE GIVEN ROOM TO GROW REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
863	NOT ONLY CAN AN EMPIRICAL SOCIOLOGY OF LAW IN PRISON DEEPLY CHALLENGE LEGALISM, BUT IT CAN DO SO WHILE AVOIDING THE UNIVOCAL CRITICAL READING THAT SEE THE INMATES RIGHTS CLAIMING ACTIVITIES AS BEING PROMISED TO FAIL, OR ELSE AS SURREPTITIOUSLY STRENGTHENING THE DOMINATION. IN CONTRADISTINCTION, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE PLURAL AND AMBIVALENT EFFECTS OF THE MOBILIZATION OF LAW IN PRISON. AFTER A HISTORICAL FLASHBACK ON THE CONTEXT OF WHICH RIGHTS ISSUE WAS SHAPE IN POST-1968 FRANCE, OUR CONTRIBUTION RELIES ON NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS AND SOURCES (ARCHIVES, INTERVIEWS, OBSERVATIONS, DOCUMENT ANALYSIS), WHICH ALLOWS US TO FOCUS LESS ON THE WELL-KNOWN INEFFICIENCY THAN ON HIGHLIGHTING A SERIES OF CONTRADICTIONS RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE NORMS. FOR EXAMPLE WE SHOW THE DEPRECIATION OF CERTAIN PRACTICAL KNOW-HOW. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENTIAL MANAGEMENT OF ILLEGALISMS WITHIN PRISON SHOWS THE LIMITS OF READING PRISON LIFE THROUGH A SIMPLISTIC OPPOSITION BETWEEN "RULE OF LAW" AND "ZONE OF LAWLESSNESS". NEITHER PANACEA NOR TRAP, LAW'S PROGRESSION IN PRISON IS SHOWN TO BE PRAGMATICALLY STRUCTURED IN SITUATIONS BY PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES OPENED UP BY IT.
864	THE AUTHOR BEGINS BY ASSERTING THAT "CONTEMPT" PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DECISIONS ON THE SENTENCES TO BE METED OUT TO CRIMINALS, SUBSTANTIATING THIS ASSERTION WITH REFERENCE TO EXAMPLES. SUCH A PHENOMENON IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE LEGAL MODEL ON WHICH THE PENAL CODE IS GROUNDED, WHICH DEFINES PUNISHMENT AND SENTENCING IN TERMS FIRST OF GUILT AND SECONDLY OF POTENTIAL THREATS TO SOCIETY. SUBSEQUENTLY THE AUTHOR INQUIRES INTO THE REASONS WHY THIS UNLAWFUL DISTORTION OF THE PENAL SYSTEM HAS REMAINED UNIDENTIFIED AND HENCE UNADDRESSED, PROCEEDING FROM THERETO DISCUSS THE FUNCTIONS AND EFFECTS OF A "POLICY OF CONTEMPT" AND THE ROLE PLAYED BY PENAL JURISDICTION AS A SOURCE OF SOCIAL UNCONSCIOUSNESS. CONSEQUENCES AND HAZARDS FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE INDICATED. THE PSYCHOANALYTIC VIEWPOINT SUBSTANTIATES THE FACT THAT THE LAW HAS VERY SOUND REASONS FOR NOT LEGITIMIZING CONTEMPT. IN PENAL JURISDICTION, CONTEMPT IS NOT ONLY UNLAWFUL BUT ALSO UNETHICAL: ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW IS AN ETHICAL IMPERATIVE. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS IMPERATIVE, PSYCHOANALYTIC SUPPORT IS REQUIRED, NOTABLY TO ENHANCE THE PROFESSIONALISM OF LAWYERS AND JUDGES.
865	AFTER RAISING DOUBTS ABOUT FOUCAULT'S APPROACH TO LAW-POWER, IN THE LIGHT OF VARIOUS ACTS OF RELIGION-INSPIRED VIOLENCE ON AND AFTER 11 SEPTEMBER 2001, A CASE IS MADE AGAINST THIS APPROACH, BASED ON THE CHARGE THAT FOUCAULT TIES LAW FAR TOO TIGHTLY TO WHAT HE CALLS NEGATIVE POWER. HE MAKES LAW PART OF JURIDICO-SOVEREIGNTY POWER, A FORM OF POWER HE REGARDS AS OUTMODED, WITH AN OUTMODED COMMITMENT TO SOVEREIGNTY AND THE STATE. IT IS ARGUED THAT IN ATTEMPTING TO SEPARATE LAW FROM WHAT HE SEES AS THE POSITIVE POWER OF MODERN GOVERNMENTALITY, FOUCAULT NEVER UNDERSTANDS LAW'S ROLE AS A PART OF A CRUCIAL BALANCE - BETWEEN POLITICAL POWER, MILITARY POWER, THE SOCIAL, THE CULTURAL, THE LEGAL, AND THE ECONOMIC - A BALANCE THAT TRIES TO ACHIEVE BOTH INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND THE SECURITY TO ENJOY THAT FREEDOM. AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING LAW, AND OF UNDERSTANDING SOVEREIGNTY AND THE STATE - THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW - IS PRESENTED AS A MUCH BETTER ROUTE TO AN APPRECIATION OF LAW'S PART IN THE BALANCE.
866	THE FIRST DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SAW A MARKED RISE IN THE NUMBER OF RECORDED MURDERS IN BRITISH-RULED BURMA. THE SENTENCE FOR MURDER PRESCRIBED BY THE INDIAN PENAL CODE-IN FORCE IN BURMA AS A PROVINCE OF BRITISH INDIA-WAS DEATH OR TRANSPORTATION FOR LIFE. HOWEVER, WHILE BURMA'S MURDER COUNT WAS RISING SHARPLY, THE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS TAKING PLACE IN THE PROVINCE'S JAILS REMAINED BROADLY STABLE, WITH PERHAPS A TENDENCY TO FALL, AND INDEED IT FELL DECISIVELY AT THE END OF THE 1930S. BY THAT POINT, A HIGH STANDARD OF EVIDENCE WAS BEING INCREASINGLY DEMANDED FOR CONVICTION FOR MURDER AND INCREASINGLY THE DEATH PENALTY WAS BEING IMPOSED ONLY WHEN MURDER HAD CLEARLY BEEN PREMEDITATED. IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN MURDER CASES, THE RULE OF LAW HAD BEEN MARKEDLY TIGHTENED. THE FOCUS IN THE ARTICLE WILL BE ON THE LOCAL PRESSURES, ON THE PRACTICES AND PERSPECTIVES OF BURMA'S COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION AND OF THE BURMESE THEMSELVES THAT LED IN TIME TO A DECISIVE FALL IN THE NUMBER OF CONVICTED MURDERERS WHO WERE HANGED FOR THEIR CRIME.
867	THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARACTER OF THE UNION LEGAL ORDER BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT SECONDARY SOURCES OF UNION LAW ARE NOT INFRINGING THE PRIMARY SOURCES, INCLUDING THE CHARTER OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CFR). THE LATTER'S IMPORTANCE AS A VALID INSTRUMENT TO BE INVOKED AGAINST MEASURES THAT ARE EXCESSIVE IN THEIR INTERFERENCE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HAS RECENTLY BEEN REINFORCED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) IN THE JUDGMENTS IN CASES SUCH AS C-694/20, ORDE VAN VLAAMSE BALIES AND OTHERS, AND JOINED CASES C-37/20 AND (DAC6) AND 5AMLD WHICH REMINDED THAT THIS IS THE CASE EVEN WHEN RULES ARE MOTIVATED BY IMPORTANT COLLECTIVE INTERESTS. THESE INCLUDE THE COMBAT AGAINST TAX EVASION AND TAX FRAUD AND ENHANCING BROADLY UNDERSTOOD TRANSPARENCY AND ARE AGREED UPON AND ARE 'VALIDATED' BY A UNION'S LEGISLATURE. THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED ARE NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED. UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE LIMITS LIE IS DECISIVE FOR VALID LAW MAKING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS FOR EFFECTIVELY INVOKING THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES.
868	THIS STUDY COMPLEMENTS THE EXTANT LITERATURE BY ASSESSING THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS IN FOOD SECURITY IN GHANA FOR THE PERIOD 1980-2019. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES TECHNIQUE AND GOVERNANCE IS CATEGORIZED INTO POLITICAL (ENTAILING POLITICAL STABILITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY), ECONOMICAL (CONSISTING OF REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS), AND INSTITUTIONAL (ENTAILING CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW) GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS. THE STUDY FINDS THAT THE ENGAGED GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY IN GHANA. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED WITH SPECIFIC EMPHASIS ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.

869	LEGAL SCHOLARS' REFLECTIONS ON "LAW IN A TIME OF CRISES" MAY LEAD TO THE QUESTION OF WHEN SOCIAL, POLITICAL, INTERNATIONAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES ACTUALLY DEVELOP INTO A LEGAL CRISIS. THE ANSWER CAN BE COMPLEX WHEN THE MATTER IS ADDRESSED BY AN ITALIAN LEGAL SCHOLAR LOOKING THROUGH THE PRISM OF DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND HISTORY. MOREOVER, ITALY'S EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE ADOPTION OF A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION DOES NOT NECESSARILY PROTECT THE LEGAL ORDER FROM EVERY CRISIS. EVEN A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM BASED ON HUMAN DIGNITY, COMBINED WITH THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW MAY NOT PREVENT DANGEROUS DRIFT. RECENTLY, TWO CRISES, IN THE SHAPE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT SEVERELY CHALLENGED ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE, GROUNDED AS THIS IS IN POST-WAR REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND VALUES. FOR THIS REASON, LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE HAD TO REFLECT AGAIN ON A DIFFICULT QUESTION: ARE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES WRITTEN IN 1947 ENOUGH TO COUNTER THE POTENTIAL NON-DEMOCRATIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE PANDEMIC AND OF THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT?
870	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DIRECT AND INTERACTIVE IMPACTS OF TRADE FACILITATION AND INSTITUTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH (SEG) FOR 41 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN ECONOMIES FROM 2005 TO 2019. THE STUDY EXPLORES THE COMPONENTS OF TRADE FACILITATION FOCUSING ON COSTS, DOCUMENTS AND DAYS (EXPORTS AND IMPORTS) WITH THE AGGREGATED INDEX (TFINDEX) AND INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY AND VIOLENCE, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, USED ON GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE RELIES ON THE TWO-STEP DYNAMIC-SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS ESTIMATOR, ACCOUNTING FOR ENDOGENEITY, SIMULTANEITY, MEASUREMENT ERROR AND REVERSE CAUSALITY CONCERNS. THE STUDY FINDS THAT FACILITATING TRADE PROCEDURES IS A VIABLE OPTION FOR ACHIEVING SEG IN THE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA REGION. IN ADDITION, INSTITUTIONS DRIVEN BY GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND REGULATORY QUALITY ARE BOOSTERS TO SEG IN THE REGION. LASTLY, THE INTERACTIVE IMPACTS OF TRADE FACILITATION AND INSTITUTIONS POSITIVELY PREDICT THE SEG. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ACHIEVING EFFICIENT TRADING PROCEDURES AND A STURDY INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WILL ENHANCE FULL EXPLORATION OF THE GROWTH POTENTIAL IN SEG.
871	HOMICIDE ENGENDERS BROAD MORAL CONCERNS IN SOCIETY, AND ITS AFTERMATH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A BAROMETER FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY. OF ALL HOMICIDES COMMITTED, HOWEVER, ONLY SOME LEAD TO ARREST, TO PROSECUTION AND ULTIMATELY TO CONVICTION IN COURT. SO FAR, NO STUDY HAS ASSESSED THE ENTIRE FLOW OF HOMICIDE CASES THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BASED ON A NATIONWIDE SAMPLE. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO FILL THIS EMPIRICAL VOID BY DESCRIBING THE ENTIRE FLOW OF HOMICIDE CASES AND ASSESSING THE SIZE OF OUTFLOW AT EACH STAGE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FUNNEL IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR A 20-YEAR PERIOD. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS TWO MAIN FINDINGS: FIRST, THE VAST MAJORITY OF SUSPECTS FIRST IDENTIFIED BY THE POLICE ARE ULTIMATELY SENTENCED FOR A HOMICIDE. SECOND, EVEN IN A COUNTRY WITH LOW HOMICIDE RATES AND HIGH RULE OF LAW INDICES, SELECTION TAKES PLACE AT ALL STAGES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FUNNEL. WHILST OUTFLOW MOSTLY CENTRES AROUND EXCEPTIONAL CLEARANCE AND LEGAL FACTORS, FUTURE WORK SHOULD ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXTRA-LEGAL CHARACTERISTICS PLAY A ROLE IN CRIMES THAT ARE BEING INVESTIGATED AS POTENTIAL HOMICIDES.
872	DESPITE HIGH ESTIMATED GAINS OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IMPLEMENTATION, PROGRESS ON THE MACRO, MESO AND MICRO LEVEL IS SLUGGISH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE, FROM A THEORETICAL ECONOMICS PERSPECTIVE, HOW FOUR BARRIERS -TECHNOLOGICAL, MARKET, INSTITUTIONAL AND CULTURAL -CAN PREVENT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. THE BARRIERS THAT CURRENTLY HINDER A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FROM DEVELOPING ARE IDENTIFIED AND A MAPPING OF THESE BARRIERS IS PERFORMED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE INTERDEPENDENT AND ENTANGLED. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT EVEN SMALL BARRIERS COULD STOP THE EMERGENCE OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. EVEN THOUGH A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS DIFFERENT FROM OUR TRADITIONAL "LINEAR" ECONOMY, THE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS IN THIS PAPER GIVES NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME RULES AS A TRADITIONAL ECONOMY. THERE WILL BE PROPERTY RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND PRICE SIGNALS GUIDING THE ECONOMY. IF SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL PARTS OF A MARKET ARE LACKING, A WEAKER CIRCULAR ECONOMY THAN OTHERWISE POSSIBLE WILL MATERIALIZE. (C) 2021 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
873	DESPITE GROWING SCHOLARLY ATTENTION, FEW STUDIES HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION AND PATTERNS OF CHINESE INTERNET POLICIES. WE CREATED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE OF NATIONAL-LEVEL CHINESE INTERNET LAWS AND POLICIES BETWEEN 1994 AND 2017 AND CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS OF 358 POLICY DOCUMENTS USING CONTENT ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. WE FOUND THAT (1) AMONG THE 71 GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INVOLVED IN CHINESE INTERNET REGULATION, THERE ARE CENTRAL-PERIPHERAL DYNAMICS AS WELL AS COMPLEX NETWORKS OF COLLABORATION; (2) ALTHOUGH MORE THAN 40% OF REGULATIONS CONCERN INFORMATION SERVICES, THE OVERALL REGULATORY EMPHASIS HAS EVOLVED FROM INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE TO ONLINE CONTENT TO DIGITAL ECONOMY; AND (3) WHILE CHINESE INTERNET POLICIES HISTORICALLY FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLE OF "RULE BY DIRECTIVES" INSTEAD OF "RULE OF LAW," DOMINATED BY LOW-LEVEL POLICIES, LEADING TO BOTH ARBITRARINESS AND ADAPTABILITY, RECENT STATE EFFORTS AIM TO STREAMLINE POLICYMAKING. OVERALL, OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO DEBATES ON THREE CORE ISSUES IN INTERNET GOVERNANCE FROM A CHINESE PERSPECTIVE: WHO (SHOULD) REGULATE THE INTERNET? WHAT ISSUES (SHOULD) FALL UNDER REGULATORY OVERSIGHT? AND HOW SHOULD THE INTERNET BE REGULATED VIA WHAT MECHANISMS?
874	THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE OF INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT IN MODULATING THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON 44 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS EMPLOYED AS THE EMPIRICAL STRATEGY, AND CO2 EMISSIONS PER CAPITA IS USED TO MEASURE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. BUNDLED AND UNBUNDLED GOVERNANCE DYNAMICS ARE EMPLOYED, NOTABLY POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY/NO VIOLENCE AND "VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY"), ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (ENCOMPASSING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY), INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW), AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE (A COMPOSITE MEASURE OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE). THE FOLLOWING MAIN FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, THE UNDERLYING NET EFFECT IN THE MODERATING ROLE OF INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE GOVERNANCE-CO2 EMISSIONS NEXUS IS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN REGRESSIONS PERTAINING TO POLITICAL GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. SECOND, THERE ARE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS FROM THE RELEVANCE OF INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT IN MODULATING THE EFFECTS OF REGULATION QUALITY, ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, AND GENERAL GOVERNANCE ON CO2 EMISSIONS. THE SIGNIFICANT AND INSIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ARE ELUCIDATED. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
875	THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANK STABILITY, NATIONAL FRAMEWORK, AND MARKET STRUCTURE AND THUS ENLIGHTEN THE POLICY-MAKING PROCESS IN REGIONAL BANKING CONSOLIDATION. THE ANALYSIS WAS RESTRICTED TO 64 LISTED COMMERCIAL BANKS IN INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE, THAILAND, AND THE PHILIPPINES, ALSO KNOWN AS ASEAN-5 BY USING THE FIXED EFFECT MODEL. THIS STUDY FOUND THE FOLLOWING: A HIGHER LEVEL OF POLITICAL STABILITY HAD INCREASED THE LEVEL OF BANK STABILITY; A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE RULE OF LAW DECREASED THE LEVEL OF BANK STABILITY; A HIGHER LEVEL OF MARKET CONCENTRATION DECREASED THE LEVEL OF BANK STABILITY. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS. FIRSTLY, THE IMPROVEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND SYSTEMS THAT LEAD TO POLITICAL STABILITY IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN THE BANKING SECTOR. SECONDLY, THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IMPROVEMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE THE BANK STABILITY. THIRDLY, AN INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS NEEDED TO INCREASE THE STABILITY OF THE BANK. FOURTHLY, EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN ASEAN COUNTRIES MUST BE FOLLOWED BY AN INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS IN GOVERNANCE AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS.
876	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CREATION OF SPACES OF LEGAL MARGINALIZATION FOR ANTI-MINING ACTIVISTS IN THE REGION OF CAJAMARCA, PERU. CENTRAL STATE INTERESTS IN PROMOTING THE COURSE OF EXTRACTIVE 'DEVELOPMENT' HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY UNDERMINED MANY OF THE LEGAL CONDITIONS FOR POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND RIGHTS ASSUMED IN 'DEVELOPED' LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC STATES. BASED ON A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS IN CAJAMARCA, I EXAMINE HOW LEGAL MARGINALIZATION IS EXPERIENCED IN A NATION-STATE WHERE CITIZENS ARE "GUARANTEED" FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN AND INDIGENOUS RIGHTS. I HIGHLIGHT TWO PROCESSES: THE TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION OF CONGA MINE CASES FROM CAJAMARCA TO LAMBAYEQUE AND THE SYSTEMATIC ARCHIVING OF ACTIVISTS' CLAIMS. THESE PROCESSES REVEAL THE MANNER IN WHICH POLITICAL ACTORS CO-PRODUCE PARADOXICAL SPACES OF LAW THAT ARE PLAYED OUT IN THE DAILY LIVES OF ACTIVISTS. I ARGUE THAT THE "RULE OF LAW" IS RENDERED FLEXIBLE AND THAT MEMBERS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES AND GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE LEGALLY-RECOGNIZED RONDAS CAMPESINAS, ARE ACTIVELY POSITIONED IN MARGINALIZED LEGAL SPACES OUTSIDE THE FUNCTIONING OF REGULAR JURIDICAL PROCESSES.

877	THE SO-CALLED GOOD GOVERNANCE MODEL REQUIRES PERFECT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE, EFFICIENT, EQUITABLE, REPRESENTATIVE, RESPONSIVE AND TRANSPARENT AND THAT RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDINGLY, THE GOOD GOVERNANCE MOVEMENT PROMOTES A VARIETY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORMS WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROMOTING ALL KINDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS AT ONCE IS IN QUESTION, BECAUSE THAT COULD OVERWHELM THE REFORM CAPABILITY OF COUNTRIES, AND MORE IMPORTANT, SOME REFORMS CAN COMPETE WITH, RATHER THAN COMPLEMENT, ONE ANOTHER. SUCH SCENARIOS ARE POSSIBLE, AND THE IMPLICATION IS CLEAR: ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM DISCOURSE MUST CONSIDER HOW TO BEST SEQUENCE AND PRIORITIZE REFORMS, THE OUTCOMES OF WHICH MUST BE IDENTIFIED. THE EXPERIENCES OF JAPAN AND SINGAPORE OFFER SOME INSIGHT INTO THIS. THIS STUDY FIRST CODIFIES ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS BY USING THE CONCEPTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE THEMES, AND IT SYSTEMATICALLY TRACES, COMPARES AND CONTRASTS REFORMS IN BOTH COUNTRIES IN LIGHT OF THESE THEMES. THIS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE SEQUENCES IN WHICH ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS EVOLVED IN THOSE PLACES CONTRIBUTED TO DISSIMILARITIES IN THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS TODAY.

878	SCHOLARS AND PUNDITS HAVE USUALLY DEPICTED BARACK OBAMA AS A PRISONER OF PARTISAN RANCOR IN CONGRESS, WHICH HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY FIERCE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE. WE ARGUE, TO THE CONTRARY, THAT HE HAS ACTIVELY - IF SOMETIMES RELUCTANTLY - EMBRACED THE ROLE OF PARTY LEADER, EVEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUREAUCRACY, THE ARENA IN WHICH THE MODERN PRESIDENCY'S CLAIM TO TRANSCEND PARTISANSHIP WAS NURTURED. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PUBLIC CELEBRATION OF UNILATERALISM - TYPIFIED BY THE "WE CAN'T WAIT" INITIATIVE - IS EMBLEMATIC OF A FAR-REACHING DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE PRESIDENCY AND AMERICAN POLITICS: THE RISE OF AN EXECUTIVE CENTERED PARTY-SYSTEM, WHICH RELIES ON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AND PRESIDENTS TO PRONOUNCE PARTY DOCTRINE, RAISE CAMPAIGN FUNDS, CAMPAIGN ON BEHALF OF THEIR PARTISAN BRETHREN, MOBILIZE GRASS ROOTS SUPPORT AND ADVANCE PARTY PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THIS DEVELOPMENT POSES HARD CHALLENGES TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT UNDERGIRDS IT, OBAMA'S INNOVATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE TACTICS MAY BE THE HARBINGER OF A NEW PARADIGM THAT EXTOLS UNILATERAL PRESIDENTIAL POLICYMAKING AS A HABITUAL SOLUTION TO PARTISAN POLARIZATION.
879	THE SCOPE AND STRUCTURE OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ) ADVOCACY HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN TWO PRINCIPAL WAYS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. FIRST, INTERNATIONAL TJ ADVOCACY HAS GREATLY EXPANDED ITS PURPOSE. WHILE IT USED TO BE AIMED PRIMARILY AT DISCRETIONARY MECHANISMS FOR SOCIETIES TO DEAL WITH PAST VIOLENCE, IT IS NOW INCREASINGLY LEGALIZED AND DIRECTED AT BROADER ISSUES, SUCH AS POSTCONFLICT PEACE ACCORDS, AND EVEN LONGER-TERM GOALS, SUCH AS INSTITUTING DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND A CULTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS LEGALIZATION OF TJ ADVOCACY HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF TJ AS A NORM OR STANDARD PRACTICE FOR STATE BEHAVIOR AFTER CONFLICT. SECOND, INTERNATIONAL TJ ADVOCACY HAS BECOME MUCH MORE PROFESSIONALIZED AND SPECIALIZED. THE PROFESSIONALIZATION TREND HAS LED TO INCREASING CALLS FOR TANGIBLE INDICATORS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TJ PROJECTS, WHICH, IN TURN, HAVE LED TO INCREASING TEMPLATIZATION OF 'BEST PRACTICES' AROUND WHICH MOST PROFESSIONAL INTERNATIONAL TJ NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) CONVERGE. AFTER PRESENTING EVIDENCE OF THIS IMPORTANT TRANSFORMATION, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TJ FIELD.
880	THE LITERATURE ON FISCAL ADJUSTMENT FOCUSES ON THE DETERMINANTS OF "SUCCESSFUL" ADJUSTMENT EPISODES THAT GENERATE DESIRABLE OUTCOMES :SUCH AS LOWER DEBT LEVELS), BUT IT GENERALLY IGNORES WHETHER AN ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED OR NOT. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE NOTION OF ADJUSTMENT NEED, WHICH IS A PERIOD OF SEVERE FISCAL DISTRESS THAT SIGNALS A CLEAR NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION. THIS NEW CONCEPT ALLOWS THE AUTHOR TO EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHY COUNTRIES GET INTO FISCAL DISTRESS, WHY SOME ARE ABLE TO FISCALLY CONSOLIDATE WHEN REQUIRED, AND WHY OTHERS ARE UNABLE TO ADJUST DESPITE AN EVIDENT NEED TO DO SO. FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, STRONG SCORES FOR BROAD MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (E.G. RULE OF LAW INDICES) ARE FOUND TO HELP AVOID SITUATIONS OF FISCAL DISTRESS, BUT WEAKER SCORES CHARACTERIZE THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ACTUALLY MANAGE TO MAKE LARGE ADJUSTMENTS. FOR ADVANCED COUNTRIES, THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF BUDGETARY INSTITUTIONS: FISCAL RULES CONTRIBUTE TO AVOIDING SITUATIONS OF FISCAL DISTRESS, AND FISCAL PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IMPROVE THE ODDS OF IMPLEMENTING ADJUSTMENTS.

881	IN THE DAYTON AGREEMENT THAT MARKED THE END OF THE CONFLICT IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN 1995, THE TWO ENTITIES COMPRISING THE STATE AGREED TO SECURE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS TO ALL PERSONS, INCLUDING CHILDREN. THEREAFTER, THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDED PRIMACY TO THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS OVER DOMESTIC LAW. FURTHER, BOSNIA LOOKS TOWARD THE EUROPEAN UNION WITH HOPE OF MEMBERSHIP. THUS, BOSNIAN CRIMINAL LAW IS IN THE MIDST OF REFORM TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION OF CHILDREN IN CONFL ICT WITH THE LAW. ACCORDINGLY, THE STRATEGY AGAINST JUVENILE OFFENDING WAS ADOPTED TO IMPROVE RESPECT FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. IT FORESEES THE ADOPTION OF A JUVENILE JUSTICE ACT, THE CREATION OF A JUVENILE COURT, AND THE APPOINTMENT OF SPECIALIZED PROFESSIONALS. SECONDLY, IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DIVERSION AND ALTERNATIVES TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THESE TWO AIMS IN THE LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND THE NEED FOR RULE OF LAW REFORM. THE PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED IN IMPLEMENTING DIVERSION, AND LOCAL INITIATIVES TAKEN TO RECTIFY THESE SHORTCOMINGS ARE ALSO ADDRESSED.
882	THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO IDENTIFY, WHAT CHANGES, TRENDS AND TENDENCIES ARE VISIBLE IN DEFINING CRIME, AND RETHINKING AND REFORMING CRIMINAL LAW AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN POST-SOVIET LITHUANIA. THE CHRONOLOGICAL LIMITS ARE THE FIRST DECADE OF LITHUANIA'S INDEPENDENCE. LITHUANIA IS CONTEXTUALISED IN THE POST-SOVIET REGION, THUS MAPPING AND TRACKING THE TRANSITION OF ITS POST-SOVIET CRIMINAL PROSECUTION SYSTEM. IN THIS REGION, AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE USSR, THE TENSION WAS CONSTANTLY GROWING BETWEEN: A) THE DECLARED DREAM OF THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION; AND B) THE GROWING RATE AND VISIBILITY OF CRIME. LITHUANIA, AS A PART OF THESE PROCESSES, USED LOCAL LAW TALENTS AND WESTERN LEGAL AID TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF REESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. BUT ALTHOUGH SUCCESSFUL IN SOME RESPECTS ( FOR INSTANCE, IN DEALING WITH THE MOST VISIBLE AND THREATENING FORMS OF ORGANISED CRIME), THE COUNTRY DID NOT MAKE ENOUGH PROGRESS IN OTHERS ( FOR INSTANCE, THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW CRIMINAL AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION CODE TOOK A LONG TIME, AS DID THE WESTERN-ORIENTED REFORM OF THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION PROCESS).
883	7HIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION WITH EMPHASIS ON THE EASING OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES. 7HE OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE REFLEXES OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RETROGRESSION TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SPECIAL EMPHASIS WAS PLACED ON THE INTANGIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE CONCEPT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REGRESSION AND THE SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. 7HE ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE USE OF PESTICIDES IN BRAZIL AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (RIGHT TO FOOD, HEALTH, ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT, AMONG OTHERS). 7HIS STUDY IDENTIFIES HOW THE RELAXATION OF LEGISLATION ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES VIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF PROHIBITION OF RETROGRESSION. THUS, THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE STATE'S LINK AND ITS ACTIONS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO GUARANTEE, PROTECT AND PRESERVE FUNDAMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. THE METHOD TO BE USED IS THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE, WITH THE REALIZATION OF A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION CANNOT HAVE SETBACKS, BEING A LIMITER OF STATE POWER.
884	DESPITE BECOMING A LEGISLATIVE ACTOR COMPARABLE TO THE COUNCIL AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE LISBON TREATY, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (EP) STILL LACKS THE POWER TO EFFECTIVELY SCRUTINIZE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) LAW AND POLICIES BY THE AGENCIES OF THE AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE (AFSJ). THE CASE OF FRONTEX HAS DEMONSTRATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SUCCESSFUL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS AT STAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTIVITIES AT THE EXTERNAL BORDERS TO HALT IRREGULAR MIGRATION FLOWS AND OTHER ILLEGAL CROSS-BORDER ACTIVITIES. ABUSES IN THIS REGARD HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, FORCING THE EU INSTITUTIONS TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE EP'S POWERS TO SCRUTINY AFSJ AGENCIES AFTER THE PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT OF THEIR MANDATES IN THE LAST DECADE, AND SUGGESTS SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENHANCE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THESE AGENCIES TO FULLY RESPECT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE VALUES ON WHICH THE EU IS BASED.
885	ROMANIA RANKS AT THE EXTREME LOW END IN EASTERN EUROPE IN TERMS OF HOFSTEDE CULTURAL INSIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND CORRUPTION-POTENTIALLY LIMITING GOVERNANCE QUALITY FOR RESTRICTING RESOURCE CHANNELING. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE WHETHER THESE SHORTCOMINGS FLOW OVER INTO THE DEGREE OF CORPORATE INSIDER TRADING PROFITABILITY AT THE FIRM LEVEL. CONSISTENT WITH HIGH POWER DISTANCE, LOW INDIVIDUALISM, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, EXECUTIVES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS EXTRACT HIGHER RETURNS. THE CONJECTURED MONITORING CONSTRAINT OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON REDUCING PROFITABLE TRADING. SECOND, MEDIA REPORTING OF FIRM-RELATED SCANDALS ONLY RESTRAINED INSIDER PROFITABILITY IN FIRMS WITH GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP-CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL FORBEARANCE OF CORRUPTION AND SANCTION FROM THE USE OF POLITICALLY CONTROLLED ASSETS. THIRD, THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS REVEALED BOTH A CRISIS OF INEPT TRADING CONSISTENT WITH HIGH UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE AND ALSO HIGHLY PROFITABLE TRADES FOR A LIMITED SET OF EXECUTIVES WHO UNDERTOOK SHORT-TERM REVERSAL STRATEGIES. OUR EXPLORATORY MICROANALYSIS SUGGESTS A PROTOTYPE TO HIGHLIGHT AREAS REQUIRING GOVERNANCE AND INVESTOR ATTENTION IN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
886	THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON BIODIVERSITY LOSS USING GLOBAL DATA CONSISTING OF 115 COUNTRIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE MEASURE BIODIVERSITY LOSS USING DATA ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THREATENED SPECIES OF AMPHIBIANS, BIRDS, FISHES, MAMMALS, MOLLUSKS, PLANTS, AND REPTILES. THE DATA WERE COMPILED FROM THE RED LIST PUBLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE (IUCN). FOR CLIMATE CHANGE VARIABLES, WE HAVE INCLUDED TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND THE NUMBER OF NATURAL DISASTER OCCURRENCES. AS FOR THE CONTROL VARIABLE, WE HAVE CONSIDERED GOVERNANCE INDICATOR AND THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. BY EMPLOYING ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE WITH ROBUST STANDARD ERROR AND ROBUST REGRESSION (M-ESTIMATION), OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ALL THREE CLIMATE CHANGE VARIABLES - TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND THE NUMBER OF NATURAL DISASTERS OCCURRENCES - INCREASE BIODIVERSITY LOSS. HIGHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALSO IMPACTED BIODIVERSITY LOSS POSITIVELY. ON THE OTHER HAND, GOOD GOVERNANCE SUCH AS THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW REDUCES BIODIVERSITY LOSS. THUS, PRACTICING GOOD GOVERNANCE, PROMOTING CONSERVATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASSES WOULD ABLE TO MITIGATE BIODIVERSITY LOSS.
887	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, COURTS AND COMMENTATORS HAVE OFTEN TREATED THE CLASS ACTION AS THOUGH IT WERE A MONOLITH, LIMITING THEIR ANALYSIS TO THE PARTICULAR CLASS FORM THAT JOINS TOGETHER A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMS FOR MONETARY RELIEF THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE MYOPIC FOCUS ON THE AGGREGATED-DAMAGES CLASS ACTION HAS LED TO UNDER THEORIZATION OF THE OTHER CLASS-ACTION SUBTYPES, WHICH SERVE FAR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND HAVE FAR DIFFERENT EFFECTS, AND HAS ALLOWED THE ONGOING BACKLASH AGAINST THE AGGREGATED-DAMAGES CLASS ACTION TO AFFECT THE OTHER SUBTYPES IN AN UNDIFFERENTIATED MANNER. THE FAILURE TO CONFINE THIS BACKLASH TO ITS INTENDED TARGET HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE OTHER CLASS FORMS, HARMING THE INTERESTS OF BOTH LITIGANTS AND THE JUDICIARY. IN PARTICULAR, IN CIVIL-RIGHTS CASES INVOLVING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF OBSTACLES TO CLASS TREATMENT POSE A THREAT TO REMEDIAL EFFICACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. COURTS, LAWMAKERS, AND SCHOLARS SHOULD THEREFORE ENGAGE IN A BROADER ANALYSIS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE SUBTYPES SET FORTH IN THE MODERN CLASS-ACTION RULE.
888	THE INSTITUTION OF ACTIVE EUTHANASIA HAS BEEN LEGAL IN COLOMBIA SINCE 2015. IN CALIFORNIA, THE REGULATION ON PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE WILL COME INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2016. THE LEGAL INSTITUTION OF ACTIVE EUTHANASIA IS NOT ACCEPTED UNDER THE LAW OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, HOWEVER, PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE IS ACCEPTED IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES. THE RELATED REGULATION IN OREGON IS IMITATED IN OTHER MEMBER STATES. IN SOUTH AMERICA, -COLOMBIA IS NOT THE FIRST COUNTRY TO LEGALIZE ACTIVE EUTHANASIA: ACTIVE EUTHANASIA HAS BEEN LEGAL IN URUGUAY SINCE 1932. THE NORTH AMERICAN LEGAL TRADITION MARKEDLY DIFFERS FROM THE SOUTH AMERICAN ONE AND BOTH ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW. IN HUNGARY AND IN MOST EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES, SOLELY THE PASSIVE FORM OF EUTHANASIA IS LEGAL. IN THE BENELUX COUNTRIES, THE ACTIVE FORM OF EUTHANASIA IS LEGAL BECAUSE THE SUPRANATIONAL LAW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DOES NOT PROHIBIT IT. NOTWITHSTANDING, EUROPEAN UNION LAW DOES NOT PRESCRIBE LEGALIZATION OF EITHER THE ACTIVE FORM OF EUTHANASIA, OR THE PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE.
889	DESPITE BEING ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT MODERN PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION, INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION (ID) IS TO A LARGE EXTENT ABSENT FROM THE SOCIOLOGICAL DEBATE OVER MODERN FREEDOM, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY TWO OTHER PRINCIPLES: THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND CAPITALIST MARKETS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ANALYSE THE EFFECTS OF ID ON INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. TO BRING ID INTO THE DEBATE, I DESCRIBE THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERMEDIARY SOCIAL PROCESSES THAT TRANSLATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS MACRO-LEVEL PROPERTY INTO CONDITIONS OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM ON THE MICRO-LEVEL. FOUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS FOLLOW FROM MY ANALYSIS: FIRSTLY, THAT INCLUDING ID PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE OPTIMISTS' WHO THINK FREEDOM HAS BEEN DEMOCRATIZED IN POST-WAR WESTERN SOCIETIES; SECONDLY, THAT TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF MODERN FREEDOM, WE NEED TO INCLUDE A NEW CATEGORY OF SOCIAL FREEDOM PROVIDED BY ID: SUBSTANTIAL' FREEDOM; THIRDLY, THAT SOCIAL EXCLUSION IS THE MAJOR THREAT TO INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM IN ID SOCIETIES; AND LASTLY THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP A CONCEPT OF POSITIVE' SOCIAL FREEDOM, IN WHICH SOCIAL STRUCTURE NOT ONLY CONSTRAINS, BUT ALSO ENABLES INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM.
890	IN THIS ARTICLE WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS THE DIMENSIONS OF ANALYSIS FOR EVALUATING AND CHARACTERIZING THE CONCEPT OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE REPORTS AND OPINIONS PRODUCED BY BRAZILIAN COURTS OF AUDIT. THE STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING ATTRIBUTED TO ACCOUNTABILITY. BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, CATEGORIES ARE DEVELOPED FOR ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS BY THESE COURTS. TWO DIMENSIONS OF ACCOUNTABILITY WERE IDENTIFIED: THE FORMAL DIMENSION, WHICH INVOLVES THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROCESS IS CONDUCTED AND PRODUCES ITS RESULTS; AND THE SUBSTANTIVE DIMENSION, INVOLVING WHAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL OF THE PROCESS, THAT IS, THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC AGENTS, THEIR ACTIONS AND DECISIONS, AND MAKING THEM KNOWN AND COMMUNICATED TO SOCIETY. THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTINGUISHING THESE TWO DIMENSIONS IS TO PERMIT A MORE OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE REPORTS AND OPINIONS PRODUCED BY THOSE COURTS IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT THE ESSENCE OF THE PROCESS OF ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, BUT WITHOUT FALLING INTO THE COMMON TRAP IN THIS KIND OF ANALYSIS OF FOCUSING ON THE FORMAL DIMENSION AND IGNORING THE ESSENTIAL, THE SUBSTANTIVE DIMENSION.
891	THIS ARTICLE APPLIES A TWO-TIERED CONTRIBUTION MODEL TO ASCERTAIN THE DETERMINANTS OF DONORS' PARTICIPATION AND CONTRIBUTION LEVELS TO GIVING AID FOR CONTROLLING HIV/AIDS IN AFRICA. BAYESIAN SPATIAL ESTIMATES FOR THE TWO-TIERED MODEL ARE PRESENTED FOR 22 DONOR COUNTRIES THAT GAVE AID TO 48 RECIPIENT COUNTRIES DURING 2000-2007. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE PUBLIC NATURE OF HIV/AIDS CONTRIBUTIONS BY INCLUDING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OTHER DONORS AS A DETERMINANT AT BOTH PARTICIPATION AND EXPENDITURE STAGES, ALONG WITH STANDARD DETERMINANTS OF GENERAL ASSISTANCE. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ACCOUNT FOR ALTRUISTIC, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, LOCATION, INSTITUTIONAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. DONOR'S REACTION TO SPILLOVERS DIFFERS IN THE TWO STAGES, THEREBY SUPPORTING THE TWO-TIERED ESTIMATES OVER THE SINGLE-STAGE TOBIT ESTIMATES. AID FOR AIDS IN AFRICA IS MOTIVATED BY A COMPLEX MIX OF STRATEGIC (PUBLICNESS), ALTRUISTIC, AND DONOR SELF-INTERESTS. KEY FACTORS AT BOTH STAGES INCLUDE DONORS' SPILLOVERS, RULE OF LAW, PAST COLONIAL TIES, SHARING A COMMON LANGUAGE, TRADE, AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV. A HOST OF ROBUSTNESS TESTS ARE PRESENTED.
892	CHINA JOINED THE WTO IN 2001 UNDER EXCEPTIONALLY UNFAVOURABLE, NON-RECIPROCAL AND ASYMMETRIC TERMS OF MEMBERSHIP. CHINA'S LESS-THAN-EQUAL STATUS RAISES DIFFICULT LEGAL QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WTO, AS THEY CALL INTO QUESTION THE NORMATIVITY OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE THE WTO SYSTEM. IT IS ARGUED THAT, IN DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY CASES INVOLVING CHINA'S WTO-PLUS OBLIGATIONS, RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION SHOULD GENERALLY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE MEANING OF AN AMBIGUOUS PROVISION, AS A VALUE-ORIENTED INTERPRETATIVE APPROACH IN FAVOUR OF THE EQUILIBRIUM OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF CHINA AND IN DEFERENCE TO THE UNIFORMITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE WTO LEGAL SYSTEM. FOR BILATERAL TRADE RELATIONS TO BE MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS AND MORE BALANCED, MAJOR WTO MEMBERS SHOULD OFFER EQUAL STATUS TO CHINA IN THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM, IN EXCHANGE FOR CHINA'S FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ITS WTO COMMITMENTS AND GREATER CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD TRADING SYSTEM. THIS ENTAILS THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECIPROCAL AND COOPERATIVE TRADE POLICIES ON BOTH SIDES.
893	TWO ANALOGIES LIE AT THE CORE OF PROFESSOR WALDRON'S ARTICLE. THE FIRST IS THE CLAIM THAT THE STANDARD ANALOGY BY WHICH THE STATE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW IS LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL IN DOMESTIC LAW IS MISLEADING; THE STATE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW IS MORE LIKE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN DOMESTIC LAW. THE SECOND IS THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW IS (OR IS LIKE) A SPECIES OF PUBLIC LAW AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH BY DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEMS. I EXAMINE BOTH CLAIMS, ARGUING (A) THAT EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THE FIRST ANALOGY IT DOES NOT GET US TO THE DEEPER LEVELS OF RESPECT AND COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT WALDRON ARGUES FOR, AND (B) THAT THE 'FLOATING NORMATIVITY' INHERENT IN THE SECOND CLAIM LEADS WALDRON TO OVERLOOK THE SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS LEAVES WALDRON'S POSITION WEAKEST WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE MOST TO OFFER: NAMELY, IN INSTANCES WHERE OUR COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL LAW ON ONE HAND AND THE RULE OF LAW ON THE OTHER SEEM TO PULL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
894	ONE OF THE MOST POLARIZING DEBATES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW IS HOW THE GOAL OF PEACE SHOULD FIGURE INTO THE WORK OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS. THE FRESHLY MINTED CRIME OF AGGRESSION LANDS THE JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PEACE VERSUS JUSTICE DILEMMA AND WILL CHALLENGE THE COURT TO PROVE ITS VALUE FOR ADVANCING PEACE IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES WHILE BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND MAINTAINING ITS LEGITIMACY. THIS ARTICLE, THE FINAL INSTALLMENT IN THE AUTHOR'S TRILOGY ON THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION, EXPLORES THE GAPS, AMBIGUITIES AND CONTRADICTIONS WOVEN INTO THE DEFINITION OF THE CRIME AND EVALUATES THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH WELL-INTENTIONED INTERNATIONAL JUDGES MIGHT ATTEMPT TO DO JUSTICE WHILE PROMOTING PEACE THROUGH DECISIONAL LAW FOCUSING ON THREE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS: THE SCOPE OF SELF-DEFENSE, THE STATUS OF HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION UNDER THE UN CHARTER AND THE CHARACTER OF AN ARMED ATTACK. ULTIMATELY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPTS OF PEACE AND JUSTICE THAT WILL PERMIT INTERNATIONAL JUDGES TO PUNISH AGGRESSION WHILE PROMOTING PEACE.
895	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLAIN ERRORS IN THE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION OF KOREA. GENERALLY SPEAKING, A CONSTITUTION CONSISTS OF TWO KINDS OF RULES: ORGANIZATIONAL RULES AND THE LIMITING RULES. HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION OF OUR COUNTRY ATTACHES TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE FORMER WHILE NEGLECTING THE LATTER THAT DEFINES THE LIMITS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY. THE REASON FOR SUCH A NEGLECT IS THAT THE CONSTITUTION STARTS FROM THE FALSE PREMISE THAT GOVERNMENT IS OMNIPOTENT AND MORALISTIC, NAMELY FROM THE ROMANTIC PLATONIC-HEGELIAN VIEW OF THE STATE. THE ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE FOR AN UNLIMITED DEMOCRACY, AND OUR GOVERNMENT IS LIMITLESS IN ITS POLITICAL POWER; SO THE CONSTITUTION SUFFERS FROM "FATAL CONCEIT" (HAYEK 1988). IN ORDER TO LIMIT THE POLITICAL POWER AND TO PROTECT PERSONAL FREEDOM EFFECTIVELY, LIMITING RULES HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED INTO THE CONSTITUTION. THE RULE OF LAW, OR THE POLITICAL IDEAL OF LIBERALISM, CAN BE PROPOSED AS THE RULE THAT EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAINS THE ARBITRARY POWER OF GOVERNMENT. IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO LIVE TOGETHER IN PROSPERITY, FREEDOM, AND PEACE.
896	TOP ADMINISTRATORS OF THE LARGEST AMERICAN MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS WERE SURVEYED REGARDING INTERROGATION LAW AND PRACTICE. MAJOR FINDINGS INCLUDE: (1) MOST BIG CITY POLICE ADMINISTRATORS DO NOT WISH TO OVERTURN MIRANDA; OFFICERS IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS COMPLIED WITH MIRANDA RULES. ADMINISTRATORS AGREED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE MAJORITY OPINIONS IN BOTH U.S. V. PATANE AND MISSOURI V. SIEBERT. (2) ADMINISTRATORS DISAGREED WITH THE PRACTICE OF DELIBERATELY EVADING MIRANDA RULES KNOWN AS INTERROGATION 11 OUTSIDE MIRANDA." (3) THREE-QUARTERS OF THE RESPONDENTS DISAGREED WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT AGGRESSIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERROGATION CAUSES FALSE CONFESSIONS. (4) THREE-FIFTHS OF BIG CITY POLICE ADMINISTRATORS FAVORED THE VIDEOTAPING OF INTERROGATION SESSIONS. (5) DISCIPLINING OFFICERS FOR MIRANDA VIOLATIONS IS UNCOMMON. THE SURVEY INDICATES "WHOLESALE" COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL RULES DESIGNED TO GUIDE POLICE INTERROGATIONS. HOWEVER, SUPPORT FOR VIOLATIONS IS SUFFICIENT TO BE OF CONCERN FOR A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT ESPOUSES THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH SOME FAILURES TO COMPLY ARE A RESULT OF FREQUENT CHANGES IN MIRANDA LAW BY THE SUPREME COURT, POLICE AGENCIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE ACTIONS OF OFFICERS.
897	THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN PROHIBITIVE LAW AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS AT THE CENTRE OF DEBATES ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, POLITICAL INTERESTS REMAIN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR NOT ONLY IN DETERMINING AND TEMPERING THE HUMANITARIAN IMPULSES OF STATES, BUT ALSO FOR GAUGING THEIR MORE GENERAL ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION DEBATE ONLY HAS MEANING IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH THERE IS GENERAL, ROUTINE ADHERENCE TO THE NON-INTERVENTIONIST NORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, CODIFIED AS ARTICLE 2(4) OF THE UN CHARTER. THE 'BUSH DOCTRINE' OF PRE-EMPTIVE SELF-DEFENCE ALTERS THE POLITICAL AND POLITICO-LEGAL CONTEXT THAT HAS UNTIL NOW GIVEN THE HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION DEBATE ITS MEANING AND IMPORTANCE. GIVEN THIS, TOGETHER WITH A MORE GENERAL LOOSENING OF THE STRICTURES PROHIBITING OR LIMITING THE USE OF FORCE, THERE IS GOOD CAUSE FOR CONCERN ABOUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE POST-1945 INTERNATIONAL ORDER. THE DEBATE ABOUT HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION CAN NO LONGER ABSTRACT THE TENSION BETWEEN LAW AND MORALITY FROM A POLITICAL ARENA THAT IS FACING SUCH PROFOUND CHALLENGES.
898	OBJECTIVESTO IDENTIFY, DESCRIBE, AND CLASSIFY THE CASES OF HEALTH CORRUPTION PRESENT IN SELECTED WESTERN [THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK)] AND CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPEAN (POLAND AND SLOVAKIA) COUNTRIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.METHODSA RAPID REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED, EVALUATING DATA FROM 11 MARCH 2020 TO 15 APRIL 2021. INFORMATION SOURCES INCLUDED MEDLINE VIA WOS, IBSS VIA PROQUEST, SCOPUS, AND GRAY LITERATURE.RESULTSTHIRTEEN CASES WERE IDENTIFIED ACROSS THE FOUR COUNTRIES. THE PRIMARY TYPE OF HEALTH CORRUPTION IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WAS PROCUREMENT CORRUPTION, WHILE MISUSE OF (HIGH) LEVEL POSITIONS WAS THE MOST PREVALENT IN CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. ACTORS FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS WERE MOST INVOLVED IN CASES. THE RULE OF LAW AND ANTI-CORRUPTION WATCHDOGS REPORTED MOST CASES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS, WHILE THE MEDIA REPORTED CASES IN POLAND AND SLOVAKIA.CONCLUSIONTHE DIFFERENCES IN TYPES OF CORRUPTION IN WE AND CEE COUNTRIES EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO CONTEXTUALIZE THE APPROACH TO TACKLE CORRUPTION. THUS, FURTHER RESEARCH IN PREVENTING AND TACKLING CORRUPTION IS A VITAL AND NECESSARY UNDERTAKING DESPITE THE INHERENT OF CONDUCTING HEALTH CORRUPTION RESEARCH.
899	THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN A PROPERTY RIGHTS MODEL OF FIRM ORGANIZATION WITH SEQUENTIAL PRODUCTION. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BASED ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND TRANSACTION-LEVEL TRADE DATA OF SLOVENIAN FIRMS REVEALS THAT THE STRENGTH OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION IN THE SUPPLIER'S LOCATION AFFECTS FIRMS' ORGANIZATIONAL CHOICES WHENEVER SUPPLIER INVESTMENTS ARE SEQUENTIAL COMPLEMENTS. IN THIS CASE, WHEN A FIRM MUST TRANSMIT KNOW-HOW TO EACH SUPPLIER, AND MORE KNOWLEDGE IS ACCRUED AS PRODUCTION MOVES DOWNSTREAM, BETTER IPR INSTITUTIONS LEAD TO LOWER INCIDENCE OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION OVER OUTSOURCING, PRINCIPALLY AT MORE DOWNSTREAM STAGES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHOICE IS FAR LESS RESPONSIVE TO IPR PROTECTION FOR SEQUENTIAL SUBSTITUTES. MOREOVER, WE SHOW THAT IMPROVING IPR AND CONTRACTING INSTITUTIONS (E.G. RULE OF LAW) MAY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON FIRM BOUNDARIES. OUR FINDINGS CONFORM WITH A PROPERTY RIGHTS MODEL IN WHICH THE QUALITY OF THE IPR REGIME GOVERNS KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN, ULTIMATELY DRIVING FIRM ORGANIZATION THROUGH THE SUPPLIERS' INCENTIVE STRUCTURE.
900	THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO CONSIDER WAYS FOR INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS IN MODERN JURISPRUDENCE MAIN CONTENT. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT INTERPRETATION WILL RESULT IN A GENERAL CONCLUSION OR A SUM OF CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE SUBJECT OF INTERPRETATION IN THE PROCESS OF CLARIFYING THE RULE OF LAW (LEGAL NORMS) USING THE ENTIRE SET OF INTERPRETATION METHODS, WHICH IS ADEQUATE TO THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THIS RULE AND MEETS THE CRITERIA OF TRUTH AND CORRECTNESS OF THE RESULT OF INTERPRETATION... METHODOLOGY: THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH IS PRESENTED AS COMPARATIVE-LEGAL AND SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS, FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, INTERPRETATION METHOD, HERMENEUTIC METHOD AS WELL AS METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS. CONCLUSIONS. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE PROCEDURE FOR ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF INTERPRETATION SHOULD BE AS FOLLOWS: GRAMMATICAL INTERPRETATION - TELEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION - CLARIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE OF THE ESSENCE OF LEGAL NORM CONTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW - SYSTEMATIC INTERPRETATION - SPECIAL LEGAL INTERPRETATION - LOGICAL INTERPRETATION - FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION - HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION - REPEATED APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATION PROCEDURE WHEN RECEIVING NEW DATA.
901	SEPARATION OF POWERS IS ONE OF THE IDEAS WITH PROFOUND THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. THE BIRTH OF THE THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS MARKED THE TRANSITION FROM THE BARBARIC USE OF POWER IN AUTHORITARIAN SOCIETIES TO THE EXERCISE OF CIVILIZED POWER IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. THEREFORE, SEPARATION OF POWERS IS CONSIDERED AN OBJECTIVE NECESSITY IN DEMOCRATIC STATES, A CONDITION TO ENSURE THE PROMOTION OF LIBERAL VALUES, AND A CRITERION FOR ASSESSING THE EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW WHERE PEOPLE'S SOVEREIGNTY PLAYS A PARAMOUNT ROLE. ON THE WAY TO PERFECTING POLITICAL THINKING, THE THEORY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS DEVELOPED INTO A COMPLETE SYSTEM IN THE MAIN PHILOSOPHY OF JOHN LOCKE. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ON ANALYZING LOCKE'S IDEOLOGY OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE BASIS AND SOME PRINCIPLES OF POWER DIVISION, AND THE ROLES OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF GOVERNMENT POWER AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM.
902	IN VIEW OF THE EDITION OF THE NEW MIGRATION LAW BY THE BRAZILIAN LEGISLATOR, MOTIVATED BY THE INCREASE OF HUMAN MOBILITY IN GLOBAL TERMS, AS WELL AS BY THE NECESSITY OF ADAPTING THE INFRACONSTITUTIONAL MIGRATION LEGISLATION TO THE PRECEPTS OF THE 1988 CONSTITUTION, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RESEARCH OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC BASIS AND STUDY OF THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION, IN WHICH THE COMPARATIVE AND DIALOGICAL METHOD WAS USED, CONTEXTUALIZES MIGRATORY FLOWS IN THE ERA OF GLOBALIZATION, MARKED BY THE RETURN OF DISCRIMINATORY AND XENOPHOBIC DISCOURSES, ANALYZES THE LOGIC OF THE FOREIGN STATUTE OF 1980 AND SEEKS TO VERIFY WHETHER ACT 13,445/2017 PROVIDES, IN FACT, A MORE DIGNIFIED TREATMENT FOR MIGRANTS BY THE BRAZILIAN STATE. TO THIS END, IT ALSO PROPOSES SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN DIGNITY, THE FOUNDATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL AND THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER BASED ON HUMAN RIGHTS, IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THAT OVERCOMING THE RESTRICTIVE LOGIC OF THE FOREIGN STATUTE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PROTECTION OF OF THE HUMAN BEING AS AN END IN ITSELF.
903	WAS NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM THE ONLY POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT PATH IN EASTERN EUROPE AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF REAL SOCIALISM? HOW DID THE RESTORATION OF CAPITALISM IN THE FORMER EASTERN BLOC AFFECT THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE WORLD? IS THE SUPPORT OF WORKERS AND LOWER CLASSES FOR RIGHT-WING POPULISTS THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EASTERN EUROPE FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS SINCE THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL A PERMANENT PHENOMENON? BY ASKING THESE QUESTIONS, THE AUTHORS POINT OUT THAT THE OFFENSIVE OF THE FAR RIGHT BEGAN IN EUROPE BEFORE THE 2015 MIGRATION CRISIS AND THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND THAT IT COINCIDED WITH THE WEAKENING OF LEFTIST WORKERS' PARTIES. THIS PROCESS BEGAN IN THE 1990S AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE EASTERN BLOC. WHAT CAN STOP THIS PROCESS AND CHANGE THE SITUATION? THE SOLUTION IS TO SHOW THAT ANOTHER MODEL IS STILL POSSIBLE: GREATER EGALITARIANISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SOCIOPOLITICAL ALTERNATIVE, HOWEVER, MUST SIMULTANEOUSLY OPPOSE TWO POWERFUL FORCES: NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM AND NATIONALIST POPULISM. JEL CODES: B50, P30, P34, P36
904	WE ANALYZE A SAMPLE OF 3,293 IPOS FROM 29 COUNTRIES TO INVESTIGATE THE FIRM, INDUSTRY, AND COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO EARNINGS MANAGEMENT DURING THE IPO PROCESS. WE FIND THAT IPO FIRMS TEND TO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE DISCRETIONARY ACCRUALS (DCA) BOTH PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE IPO, SUGGESTING THAT IPO FIRMS TEND TO ENGAGE IN PRE-IPO EARNINGS MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FIND THAT USING A PROXY FOR EARNINGS MANAGEMENT IN THE IPO YEAR MAY LEAD TO BIASED CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING PRE-IPO EARNINGS MANAGEMENT. FIRMS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FUTURE (FIRMS WITH HIGH LEVERAGE, AND FIRMS BACKED BY A VENTURE CAPITALIST) ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN PRE-IPO EARNINGS MANAGEMENT. FIRMS OPERATING IN COUNTRIES WITH A SUPERIOR RULE OF LAW ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN EARNINGS MANAGEMENT. LASTLY, WE FIND THAT FIRMS MAY ENGAGE IN PRE-IPO EARNINGS MANAGEMENT IN PART TO AVOID RETURNING TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO RAISE MORE FUNDS (CAPITAL MARKET STAGING). THIS RESULT IS ROBUST TO POSSIBLE ENDOGENEITY BIAS STEMMING FROM MANAGEMENT SELF-SELECTION.
905	THE GOOD COUNTRY INDEX (GCI) MEASURES COUNTRIES' CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL PROSPERITY IN DOMAINS SUCH AS PEACE, CLIMATE AND HEALTH. IT IS KNOWN THAT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND WEALTH CAN ENHANCE A COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO BE 'GOOD'. HOWEVER, PAST RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE COGNITIVE ABILITY OF A SOCIETY - AND OF ITS INTELLECTUAL CLASSES IN PARTICULAR - AS WELL AS EDUCATION AND BACKGROUND FACTORS SUCH AS CULTURE AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY, MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. USING CORRELATIONS, CROSS-SECTIONAL PATH ANALYSES AND LONGITUDINAL PATH ANALYSES, WE EXAMINED THE GAS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: AVERAGE COGNITIVE ABILITY, COGNITIVE LEVEL OF INTELLECTUAL CLASSES, EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY, CULTURE (INDICATED BY RELIGION), CONSANGUINITY, EDUCATION, POLITICS (RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY) AND WEALTH (GDP PER CAPITA). THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP BETWEEN MEASURES OF POLITICS AND THE GCI (E.G., FREEDOM; EMPIRICALLY R = .76 TO .84). THE MOST IMPORTANT VARIABLE FOR EXPLAINING INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE GC I WAS THE COGNITIVE LEVEL OF INTELLECTUAL CLASSES (AROUND R = .72), FOLLOWED BY INDICATORS OF CULTURE (R = .64 TO .69). BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE INTELLECTUAL CLASS APPROACH ARE DISCUSSED.
906	MANY ARGUE THAT DURING CONFLICT, EXECUTIVE POWER EXPANDS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE JUDICIARY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A COMMON CONJECTURE, NO SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF CONFLICT AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE EXISTS. WE ARGUE THAT CONFLICT, RATHER THAN STRICTLY INHIBITING INDEPENDENCE, IS INSTEAD A CRITICAL JUNCTURE THAT INCREASES THE POSSIBILITY OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. WE ASSESS THIS CLAIM IN THREE WAYS: CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSES OF (1) DE FACTO AND (2) DE JURE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AFTER THE ONSET OF CONFLICT, AND (3) A CASE STUDY OF STATUTORY AND JURISDICTIONAL CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE U.S. CIVIL WAR. EACH ILLUSTRATES THAT CONFLICT ONSET IS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF CHANGING LEVELS-BOTH DECREASES AND INCREASES-RATHER THAN UNIDIRECTIONAL DECREASES IN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. WE THEN PRESENT PRELIMINARY HYPOTHESES AND ANALYSES FOR THREE FACTORS THAT, GIVEN CONFLICT ONSET, SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER IMPROVED OR WORSENED CONDITIONS FOR THE JUDICIARY. THIS STUDY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH ON CONFLICT, COURTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN BOTH POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL STUDIES.
907	DESPITE BEING TRADITIONALLY SEEN AS THE LARGEST THREAT TO DEMOCRATIZATION, COUPS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ARGUED TO PROVIDE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. CENTRAL TO POST-COUP DEMOCRATIZATION IS THE BELIEF THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN EXERT SUFFICIENT LEVERAGE TO COERCE COUP-BORN GOVERNMENTS TO ALLOW A TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE. WE CONTRIBUTE TO THIS YOUNG BODY OF WORK BY THEORIZING THAT LESS COERCIVE ASPECTS OF TRANSNATIONAL ECONOMICS CAN PROMPT COUP-BORN GOVERNMENTS TO VOLUNTARILY TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE. IN SHORT, WE ARGUE THAT COUPS IN STATES THAT ARE MORE CLOSELY TIED TO THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY THROUGH TRADE DEPENDENCE, AND ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO LOSS OF INVESTOR CONFIDENCE DUE TO RELIANCE ON HIGH CONTRACT INTENSIVENESS, WILL SEE COUP-BORN GOVERNMENTS ATTEMPT TO LEGITIMIZE A NEW GOVERNMENT AND TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW BY SWIFTLY STEPPING DOWN. A CROSS-NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF OVER 200 COUPS FROM 1950 TO 2010 PROVIDES STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE ARGUMENT, AS TRADE DEPENDENCE AND CONTRACT INTENSIVE MONEY ARE FAR STRONGER DETERMINANTS OF POST-COUP DEMOCRATIZATION THAN OTHER FACTORS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATIZATION.
908	IN PREVIOUS WORK REGARDING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) ARRANGEMENTS THE THEORETICAL RATIONALES AND EMPIRICAL RESULTS HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON ANALYZING THE IMPORTANCE OF QUANTITATIVE FEATURES RELATED TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS DERIVING FROM PUBLIC DEFICITS, THE EXISTENCE OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE GAP AND THE EFFICIENCY HYPOTHESIS. THUS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING DETERMINANTS BEHIND THE PROLIFERATION AND EXECUTION OF PPPS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE THAT NON-FINANCIAL (SUCH AS POLITICAL, LEGAL AND MACROECONOMIC) DETERMINANTS HAVE IN ESTABLISHING A PPP, AS WELL AS THE FACTORS THAT ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF A COUNTRY TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THROUGH PPPS IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT REPRESENTED BY ECONOMIC FREEDOM, COMPETITIVENESS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PPPS, AS WELL AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM, WHERE REGULATORY QUALITY AND EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF A PPP. THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF PPPS ARE ALSO KEY FACTORS IN MAKING A COUNTRY MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR ESTABLISHING PPPS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. APM AND IPMA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
909	OVER TWO DECADES OF EXTERNAL EFFORTS AT INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN SOMALIA HAVE FAILED TO REVIVE A FUNCTIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT THERE. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS, NOT LEAST OF WHICH ARE POWERFUL LOCAL INTERESTS IN PERPETUATING WEAK GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, FACILITATING CORRUPTION AND OTHER ILLICIT ACTIVITIES. BUT SOME NOTABLE SUCCESSES HAVE OCCURRED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, BOTH WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS. MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE SOURCES OF FORMAL GOVERNANCE IN SOMALIA'S FAILED STATE, PROVIDING BASIC SECURITY AND SERVICES VIA LEGITIMATE AND RESPONSIVE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION, INFORMAL HYBRID GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS, DRAWING ON A COMBINATION OF CUSTOMARY AUTHORITY, SHARIA COURTS, BUSINESS LEADERS, WOMEN'S MARKET GROUPS, AND PROFESSIONALS, HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL SOURCE OF ROUTINIZED, LEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW IN SOMALIA. EXTERNAL ACTORS HAVE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND THEIR PLACE IN WIDER STATE-BUILDING EFFORTS. WHERE EXTERNAL AID HAS HELPED WITH LOCAL AND INFORMAL GOVERNANCE IN SOMALIA, IT HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CALIBRATED AND BASED ON CLOSE CONTEXTUAL KNOWLEDGE, NOT TEMPLATE-DRIVEN PROJECTS.
910	MOUSSEAU, MICHAEL. (2012) CAPITALIST DEVELOPMENT AND CIVIL WAR. INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY, DOI: 10.1111/J.1468-2478.2012.00734.X ?(C) 2012 INTERNATIONAL STUDIES ASSOCIATION CAPITALISM HAS EMERGED AS A FORCE FOR PEACE IN STUDIES OF INTERSTATE CONFLICT. IS CAPITALISM ALSO A FORCE FOR PEACE WITHIN NATIONS? THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW A MARKET-CAPITALIST ECONOMYONE WHERE MOST CITIZENS NORMALLY OBTAIN THEIR LIVELIHOODS CONTRACTING IN THE MARKETCREATES CITIZEN-WIDE PREFERENCES FOR UNIVERSAL FREEDOM, PEACE, AND THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. PRIOR RESEARCH HAS CORROBORATED THE THEORYS PREDICTIONS LINKING MARKET-CAPITALISM WITH LIBERAL PREFERENCES, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND PEACE AMONG NATIONS. HERE, GRANGER TESTS OF CAUSALITY SHOW THAT MARKET-CAPITALISM CAUSES HIGHER INCOME, BUT HIGHER INCOME DOES NOT CAUSE MARKET-CAPITALISM, AND FROM 1961 TO 2001 NOT A SINGLE CIVIL WAR, INSURGENCY, OR REBELLION OCCURRED IN ANY NATION WITH A MARKET-CAPITALIST ECONOMY. MARKET-CAPITALISM IS THE STRONGEST VARIABLE IN THE CIVIL CONFLICT LITERATURE, AND MANY OF THE MOST ROBUST RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS LITERATURE ARE SPURIOUSINCLUDING INCOME, STATE CAPACITY, AND OIL-EXPORT DEPENDENCY.
911	THIS PART OF THE SURVEY COVERS MATERIALS REFLECTING CHINESE PRACTICE IN 2007 RELATING TO (I) FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (GENERAL POSITION; RESPECT OF SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY; NON-INTERVENTION OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS; RULE OF LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL); (II) INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY (NUCLEAR POLICY AND NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT; NON-PROLIFERATION; AGAINST TERRORISM; PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS; NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR ISSUE; IRANIAN NUCLEAR ISSUE; MYANMAR SITUATION; AFGHANISTAN SITUATION; DARFUR SITUATION IN SUDAN; HAITI SITUATION); (III) CHINA'S TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY (TAIWAN; TIBET; XISHA ISLANDS AND NANSHA ISLANDS; DIAOYU ISLANDS); (IV) INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE SEA (DELIMITATION OF EAST CHINA SEA; OKINOTORI REEF (CHONGZHINIAO JIAO); DELIMITATION OF THE OUTER LIMITS OF CONTINENTAL SHELF BEYOND 200 NAUTICAL MILES; INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITY; NAVIGATION; POLLUTION FROM VESSELS); (V) INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE OUTER SPACE (PEACEFUL USE OF THE OUTER SPACE; APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE OUTER SPACE TREATY IN CHINA'S COURTS); (VI) INDIVIDUALS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (NATIONALITY; NORTH KOREAN ASYLUM-SEEKERS IN CHINA; DIPLOMATIC PROTECTION AND CONSULAR PROTECTION; EXPULSION OF ALIENS).
912	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE LOGIC OF VIOLENCE OF THE JNIM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MALIAN CIVIL WAR. AFTER A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE MALIAN CONFLICT, THIS ARTICLE WILL APPLY BENJAMIN LESSING'S MODEL ON THE LOGIC OF VIOLENCE IN CRIMINAL WARS TO JNIM. THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF LESSING'S MODEL, THIS ARTICLE WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW JNIM'S INSURGENCY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A CASE OF VIOLENT CORRUPTION IN THE CONTEXT OF A WAR OF CONSTRAINT. COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS, THIS PAPER WILL SHOW FIRSTLY, HOW THE MALIAN CIVIL WAR SHOULD BE CONCEIVED AS A WAR OF CONSTRAINT RATHER THAN A WAR OF CONQUEST; SECONDLY, HOW JNIM IS USING VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO RESTRICT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOME REGIONS WHICH ARE STRATEGIC ALSO FOR ITS FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BY ADOPTING THIS NEW FRAMEWORK, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME SOME CONUNDRUMS CHARACTERISING THE DEBATE ON THE MALIAN INSURGENCY AND TO HIGHLIGHT SOME RELEVANT TOPICS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
913	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS AND ANALYZES THE EU VALUES COMPLIANCE MECHANISM AS SET UP IN REGULATION 1141/2014, AND AMENDED BY REGULATION 2018/673, ON THE STATUTE AND FUNDING OF EUROPEAN POLITICAL PARTIES AND EUROPEAN POLITICAL FOUNDATIONS. IT ASSESSES TO WHAT EXTENT THIS REGULATION, THAT HAS BEEN PERCEIVED AND PRESENTED AS TARGETING "POPULISTS," PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TO ILLIBERAL POLITICS AT EU LEVEL, AND WHAT LESSONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM ITS ORIGIN FOR THE APPLICATION OF OTHER VALUES COMPLIANCE BASED INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS ARTICLE 7 TEU. FOR THAT PURPOSE IT TRACKS THE REGULATION'S DRAFTING HISTORY IN CONSIDERABLE DETAIL AND CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE OUTCOME. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE REGULATION OFFERS A LIMITED AND LIMITING FRAMEWORK TO ACT AGAINST ILLIBERAL POLITICAL FORCES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, BECAUSE IT IS UNLIKELY TO WORK IN DISCIPLINING MAINSTREAM POLITICAL GROUPS AND PARTIES THAT HARBOR ILLIBERAL ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ARTICLE 2 TEU-RELATED PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS MEMBER STATES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES ELEMENTS OF THE MECHANISM THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP SHAPE A MORE EFFECTIVE EU RESPONSE TO RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING ACROSS EUROPE.
914	THE INDO-PACIFIC, CONSTRUCTED EITHER AS A REGION, SUPER-REGION OR NON-REGION, IS CURRENTLY A HOTLY CONTESTED MAP-MAKING PHENOMENON. VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND CULTURES, WASHED BY THE WATERS OF THESE AMORPHOUS OCEANIC BOUNDARIES AND SEA SPACES, ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING TO ESTABLISH EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIAL CLAIMS OVER THESE WATER SPACES BY INVOKING STORIES AND NARRATIVES TAKEN FROM PRE-COLONIAL, COLONIAL AND POST-COLONIAL ERAS. THESE STORIES ARE OFTEN USED IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEGITIMATE "NATURAL", AND MORE ESSENTIALIST RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CERTAIN CULTURES AND/OR NATION-STATES WITH THEIR SURROUNDING SEAS. THESE NARRATIVES BOTH CHALLENGE THE BROADER INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AND ITS RULE OF LAW, AND CREATE INTERNAL NARRATIVES, STRENGTHENING DOMESTIC AND NATIONAL SUPPORT FOR STATE-BUILDING PROGRAMS IN THE REGION/S. BUT THE INDO-PACIFIC IS MORE THAN A CONTESTATION BETWEEN NATION-STATIST IMAGINATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS. IT ALSO INVOKES STORIES WHICH SEEK TO DEVELOP AND CELEBRATE A SHARED "MARITIME REGIONALISM" BEYOND THE EXCLUSIVE AND USUALLY DOMINANT POLITICS OF NATION-STATES. FINALLY, A THIRD INTERPRETIVE CATEGORY IS USED: THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INDO-PACIFIC AS A GLOBALISED "NON-SPACE".
915	THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE THE STRATEGIES BY WHICH A NUMBER OF INTELLECTUALS IN CHINA HAVE STAKED OUT A LIBERAL POSITION IN THEIR WORK OVER THE LAST DECADE, DOING SO IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION NOT ONLY FROM RIVAL INTELLECTUAL GROUPS BUT ALSO THE STATE'S IDEOLOGICAL MACHINERY. THE WRITINGS OF THESE INTELLECTUALS TAKE UP THEMES INHERENT TO THE LIBERAL POLITICAL TRADITION, INCLUDING DEMOCRACY, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW. COLLECTIVELY, THEY SEEK TO REVIVE LIBERAL IDEAS AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE POLITICAL REFORMS, WORKING AT A TIME WHEN NEW LEFT AND NEW CONFUCIAN DISCOURSES HAVE RISEN TO POSITIONS OF PROMINENCE IN INTELLECTUAL CIRCLES, EACH OF WHICH REINFORCE THE CULTURAL NATIONALISM OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR OWN WAYS. IN RESPONDING TO THIS INTELLECTUAL LANDSCAPE, LIBERAL THINKERS HAVE RECKONED WITH FOUR MAJOR AREAS OF CONCERN IN THEIR WORK: THE MEANING OF CHINA'S 20TH-CENTURY HISTORY, PARTICULARLY THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION; THE SOCIAL INEQUALITY CREATED BY MARKET REFORMS; STATISM AS A DISCOURSE OF POWER THAT OPENLY REJECTS EURO-AMERICAN POLITICAL MODELS; AND CULTURAL PLURALISM AS A GROUNDING IDEA FOR 21ST-CENTURY CHINA.
916	THE ARTICLE USES THE CASE OF JAPAN TO ARGUE THAT THE THEORY OF OPEN ACCESS ORDER ADVOCATED BY NORTH AND HIS COLLEAGUES GOES BEYOND WHAT IS NECESSARY. ALTHOUGH THEIR THEORY OF OPEN ACCESS ORDER EXPLAINS THE WEST RELATIVELY WELL, IT DOES NOT ALWAYS APPLY TO CONTEMPORARY NON-WESTERN COUNTRIES. SIMILAR TO THE CASE OF INDIA EXAMINED ELSEWHERE, THE CASE OF JAPAN REVEALS THAT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IS THE OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND THE INTERCONNECTED INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREAS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, FINANCIAL MARKET, RULE OF LAW, AND HUMAN RESOURCE ACCUMULATION. IN OTHER WORDS, COUNTRIES WITHOUT OPEN ACCESS IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IF THEY ENSURE OPEN ACCESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND DEVOTE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO ESTABLISHING THE NECESSARY INTERCONNECTED INSTITUTIONS EXAMINED IN THIS ARTICLE. FURTHER RESEARCH ELSEWHERE ON SINGAPORE AND CHINA WILL SHED MORE LIGHT ON THIS DEBATE.
917	EUROPEAN LEGISLATORS MUST INCREASINGLY DEAL WITH ISSUES RELATED TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. RELIGION IS A FREQUENT TOPIC OBLIGING THEM TO DO SO. IT IS NOT DIRECTLY PART OF THE EU'S COMPETENCES BUT IS A SOURCE OF VALUES UNDERLYING POLICY CHOICES AND A TRICKY POLITICAL OBJECT. RELYING ON THE FINDINGS OF A SURVEY ABOUT WHAT MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (MEPS) BELIEVE AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THESE BELIEFS, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES POTENTIAL TENSIONS CREATED BY RELIGION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY THE EU. A FIRST PART SHOWS HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT EUROPEAN LAW MEETS RELIGION, AND HOW IT LEAVES AMPLE ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY BUT ALSO FOR DIVERGENT INTERPRETATIONS. A SECOND PART STATES THAT MEPS AGREE LARGELY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION BETWEEN POLITICS AND RELIGION, BUT MAY BE DIVIDED WHEN IT COMES TO DRAWING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS. THE CONCLUSION POINTS OUT THE LIMITS OF THE RULE OF LAW TO PREVENT CONFLICTS AND SUGGESTS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS MAY INSPIRE SUPPORT AS WELL AS CAUSE RESISTANCE TO EUROPEANIZATION.
918	THE CRIMINAL LAW FRAMEWORKS OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS AND MILITARY INTERVENTIONS OFTEN REVEAL AN URGENT REQUIREMENT FOR REFORM. THE PROMOTION OF FAIR AND EFFECTIVE JUSTICE SYSTEMS, THE RULE OF LAW AND TRANSITION FROM CONFLICT TO PEACE FREQUENTLY NECESSITATES THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW STATE LEGISLATION. LEGAL TRANSPLANTS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AS A LEGISLATIVE TOOL TO BRING ABOUT POST-CONFLICT LEGAL CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE USE OF TRANSPLANTED LAW IN THESE SITUATIONS HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL AND HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR ADOPTING IT. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE JUSTIFICATION FOR EMPLOYING LEGAL TRANSPLANTS TO DEVELOP NEW POST-CONFLICT CRIMINAL LAWS BY ASSESSING THEIR PRACTICAL UTILITY AND THE MOTIVATIONAL RATIONALE FOR EMPLOYING THEM. IT REVIEWS THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON TRANSPLANT FEASIBILITY AND REFLECTS ON THE EXPERIENCE OF PREVIOUS CRIMINAL LAW LEGAL TRANSPLANTS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY PROPOSING AN EVALUATIVE TEST FOR PRIOR APPLICATION TO POST-CONFLICT CRIMINAL LEGAL TRANSPLANTS TO ASSESS THEIR PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS AND TO GAUGE THE NECESSITY FOR LATER CHANGE AND ADAPTATION.
919	THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP OF PERSONAL QUALITIES OF STUDENTS OF MOSCOW UNIVERSITIES, WITH SOME ELEMENTS OF JUSTICE. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THE EXISTENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERSONAL QUALITIES OF STUDENTS AND THEIR PERCEPTUAL ATTITUDES TOWARD THE IMAGE OF A TERRORIST. IN PARTICULAR, THE HIGH INTELLECTUAL LEVEL IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER PROPENSITY TO ATTRIBUTE CRIMINAL TRAITS SUCH AS RADICALISM, SENSITIVITY, ANXIETY. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE LEVEL OF LEGAL AWARENESS OF STUDENTS IS MORE DEPENDENT ON SOCIAL FACTORS, THE DOMINANT ROLE OF WHICH IS PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF TRAINING IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THE TRAINING OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS RULE OF LAW. RESULTS OF THE STUDY SUGGEST THAT STUDENTS LAWYERS HAVE MORE ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP AND SEVERE LEVELS OF JUSTICE. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATED THE PROSPECTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS DIRECTION, THE WAYS OF CORRECTION PROVEN IN THE STUDY QUESTIONNAIRE.
920	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A DIFFERENT THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF THE ROLE OF DOMESTIC COURTS WHEN ENGAGED IN JUDICIAL REVIEW OF DECISION-MAKING BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. MANY DOMESTIC COURTS IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES OPERATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A 'PUBLIC-LAW MODEL' WHEN ADJUDICATING QUESTIONS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, UNDERWRITTEN BY RESPECT FOR DOCTRINES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS. DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY OF DOMESTIC-COURT DECISIONS IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE PUBLIC LAW MODEL'S FOCUS ON CONCEPTS OF 'BINDINGNESS' AND HIERARCHY BETWEEN JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANS CAN LEAD TO DISTORTED OUTCOMES WHEN APPLIED TO DECISION-MAKING BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, THE AUTHOR PROPOSES A DIFFERENT THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE, DESCRIBED AS THE 'DIALOGUE MODEL', OF COURTS WHEN ENGAGING IN THE REVIEW OF SECURITY COUNCIL DECISION-MAKING. THE IDEA IS THAT DOMESTIC COURTS SHOULD CONFINE THEMSELVES TO TOOLS OF 'INTERPRETATION' AND 'DECLARATION' IN THEIR APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, SO AS TO POSITION THEIR JUDGMENTS IN A MORE THEORETICALLY SUPPORTABLE WAY IN THE BROADER LEGAL CONTEXT.
921	ON 31 OCTOBER 2012 THE SUPREME COURT OF ENGLAND AND WALES HANDED DOWN ITS JUDGMENT IN RAHMATULLAH V SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE [2012] UKSC 48. THE CASE CONCERNS AN APPLICATION FOR HABEAS CORPUS BROUGHT BY A CITIZEN OF PAKISTAN ORIGINALLY DETAINED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM IN IRAQ BEFORE BEING TRANSFERRED INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE UNITED STATES. RAHMATULLAH ADDRESSES IMPORTANT ISSUES CONCERNING THE EXTRATERRITORIAL REACH OF HABEAS CORPUS UNDER ENGLISH LAW IN RESPECT OF PERSONS HELD IN THE CUSTODY OF A FOREIGN STATE, AS WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE CASE MAY BE CONSIDERED A LEGAL VICTORY FOR PERSONS DETAINED WITHOUT TRIAL BY THE US IN FACILITIES THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE COURTS. HOWEVER, IN REALITY ANY STRENGTH IN THE ARM OF THE LAW IS DRAINED BY THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO THE CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 'FORBIDDEN TERRITORY' FOR THE COURTS, OVER THE COURT'S RULING AND THE UK'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE CASE IS EXAMINED IN THE LIGHT OF SIMILAR JURISPRUDENCE FROM US AND AUSTRALIAN COURTS.
922	IN SOME WESTERN COUNTRIES WITH MUSLIM MINORITIES, THERE HAS BEEN DEBATE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT THE ROLE OF SHARI'A IN THE CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC FAMILY LAW. IN AUSTRALIA THERE HAS BEEN A NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO THE ADOPTION OF SHARI'A, AS THIS FORM OF LAW HAS BEEN SEEN AS DIVISIVE, PATRIARCHAL, AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. UNDERLYING THESE RESPONSES TO SHARI'A HAS BEEN THE IMPLICATION THAT ISLAMIC LAW WAS/ IS BACKWARD AND PATRIARCHAL WHEREAS WESTERN LAW WAS/IS BOTH SECULAR AND EGALITARIAN. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DO THREE THINGS: FIRST, TO SHOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH MATRIMONIAL SETTLEMENTS BY MUSLIMS IN DIVORCE CASES REFLECT A VARIETY OF PERSONAL PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES TOWARD SHARI'A AND AUSTRALIAN FAMILY LAW; SECOND, TO EXAMINE THE VALUES OF AUSTRALIAN LAW AND HOW LAW AS A "FORM OF PRACTICE" EXCLUDES MUSLIM VALUES; AND THIRD, TO SITUATE THIS DEBATE WITHIN THE MULTIPLE MODERNITY THESIS AND ARGUE THAT, TO MOVE THE MATTER FURTHER, WE SHOULD LOOK INTO WORKING TOWARD A NEW MULTIFAITH PRAGMATIC MODERN PROJECT.
923	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (THE COURT) RELATING TO THE RIGHTS OF TRAVELLING PEOPLES. IN ITS EARLY CASE LAW ON THIS TOPIC, THE COURT'S APPROACH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WAS TO ENSURE EQUALITY OF TREATMENT. THIS APPROACH APPEARS LAUDABLE, BUT IN PRACTICE IT FUNCTIONED AS A FAILURE TO PROTECT DIFFERENCE, OR IDENTITY, ESPECIALLY MINORITY IDENTITIES; OR, WHEN DIFFERENCE WAS RECOGNISED, IT WAS RECOGNISED AS A PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS MORE RECENTLY UNDERTAKEN A REAPPRAISAL OF ITS APPROACH. IN ESSENCE, AND ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE SCOPE FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, THE COURT HAS MOVED TO ABANDON A JURISPRUDENCE OF SAMENESS OR EQUALITY IN FAVOUR OF ELABORATING A JURISPRUDENCE OF DIFFERENCE. THE COURT NOW RECOGNISES THAT LAW APPLIES DIFFERENTIALLY BY REFERENCE TO CULTURE AND ETHNICITY, AND ALSO THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS POSITIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (THE CONVENTION) TO PROTECT DIFFERENCE, OR MINORITY IDENTITIES, FROM BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION.
924	THIS WAS THE FIRST ASSESSMENT OF MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCE GOVERNANCE ON KOH TAO, A SMALL ISLAND IN THE WESTERN GULF OF THAILAND. THE STUDY ASSESSED PERCEPTIONS OF GOVERNANCE OF MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES AMONG NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES AND KOH TAO RESIDENTS ON THE BASIS OF GOVERNANCE COMPONENTS LAW, INSTITUTIONS AND PROCESS AND GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES TRANSPARENCY, PARTICIPATION, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. GOVERNANCE TO DEAL WITH THE ANTICIPATED CONTINUED GROWTH IN MARINE-BASED TOURISM IS CHALLENGED. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND GOVERNANCE WEAKNESSES, WHICH, IF THEY ARE NOT ADDRESSED, WILL BE OBSTACLES TO THE FUTURE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF KOH TAO. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THAT SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNANCE WILL BE KEY TO MAINTAINING SUSTAINABLE USE OF MARINE AND COASTAL RESOURCES ON THE ISLAND AND ENSURING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY, WHICH DEPENDS ON THESE RESOURCES. WE SUGGEST A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN APPLY GENERALLY IN COUNTRIES WISHING TO CONSERVE MARINE AND COASTAL BIODIVERSITY AND USE THOSE RESOURCES SUSTAINABLY ON COASTS AND ISLANDS.

925	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ON PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT DURING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS OF 2008-2009. LEVERAGING A UNIQUE CROSS-NATIONAL DATASET ON PORTFOLIO FLOWS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS IN SEPTEMBER 2008, IT SHOWS THAT COUNTRIES WITH BETTER INSTITUTIONS - THOSE WITH MORE (OR LESS) DEMOCRATIC, MORE (OR LESS) CONSTRAINED OR MORE ACCOUNTABLE POLITICAL SYSTEMS - WERE NO LESS VULNERABLE TO PORTFOLIO OUTFLOWS THAN COUNTRIES WITH WORSE INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, COUNTRIES WITH BETTER GOVERNANCE PRIOR TO THE CRISIS - THOSE WITH BETTER REGULATORY APPARATUSES, RULE OF LAW, PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND THOSE CONSIDERED LESS POLITICALLY RISKY - EXPERIENCED LOWER NET PORTFOLIO CAPITAL OUTFLOWS AFTER LEHMAN. GOVERNANCE IS IN FACT THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF PORTFOLIO CAPITAL FLOWS DURING THE GLOBAL FLIGHT TO LIQUIDITY, WHILE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS PERFORM POORLY. THE FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ONTO THE POLITICAL FACTORS THAT MEDIATED HOW THE COLLAPSE OF LEHMAN AFFECTED NATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS THE WORLD OVER, AND HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR LITERATURES ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS FOR BROADER TOPICS OF INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNANCE, AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.
926	BETTER DEVELOPED LEGAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS RESULT IN GREATER AVAILABILITY OF RELIABLE FIRM-SPECIFIC INFORMATION. WHEN STOCK PRICES REFLECT MORE FIRM-SPECIFIC INFORMATION THERE WILL BE LESS STOCK PRICE SYNCHRONICITY. THIS PAPER TRACES THE EXPERIENCE OF CHINA, AN ECONOMY UNDERGOING DRAMATIC INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN THE LAST 20 YEARS WITH RICH VARIATION IN EXPERIENCES ACROSS PROVINCES. WE SHOW THAT STOCK PRICE SYNCHRONICITY IS LOWER WHEN THERE IS INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN TERMS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL PLURALISM ON SYNCHRONICITY. A MORE PLURALISTIC REGIME REDUCES UNCERTAINTY AND OPAQUENESS REGARDING GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS AND THEREFORE INCREASES THE VALUE OF FIRM-SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT REDUCES SYNCHRONICITY.

927	THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF PLANNING INSTRUMENTS IN EFFECTIVE SOCIAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR OF PUBLIC POLICIES AND BUDGETS. THE RESEARCH USED THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD, FROM THE READBACK OF THE DOCTRINE ON THIS SUBJECT PRODUCTION, WITH PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE REPRESENTED BY MODELS THAT SET OUT TO OVERCOME THE HUGE GAP BETWEEN ABSTRACT NORMATIVE PREDICTION AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS IN THE REAL WORLD. FROM THE DELIMITATION OF THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC POLICY, SOUGHT TO CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC POLICY AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, OUTLINING THE CONTOURS OF ITS ANATOMY AND FUNCTIONALITY. IT ALSO SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC POLICY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE THAT THOSE ENGAGED IN THE FULFILLMENT OF SUCH GENRE. TO REACH THIS GOAL, DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF PROHIBITION OF INADEQUACY AND THE INERTIA IN THE PRODUCTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC POLICIES AIMED AT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. SIMILARLY, INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF THE BUDGET IN CONTROL OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SOCIAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC MANAGEMENT.
928	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO RESEARCH THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN SEE COUNTRIES (ALBANIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, BULGARIA, CROATIA, MACEDONIA, MONTENEGRO, ROMANIA AND SERBIA) AND ITS IMPORTANCE IN ATTRACTING FDI INFLOWS. SEVERAL REGRESSION MODELS ARE CREATED TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHOSEN LOCATION DETERMINANTS. THE MODELS INCLUDE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ABOUT THE TRANSITION PROGRESS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, BUT ALSO VARIABLES ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SEE REGION SUCH AS GDP PER CAPITA, GROWTH RATE, INFLATION AND WAGES. THE RESULTS OF THE PANEL DATA ANALYSIS INDICATED THE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS (GDP P.C. AND INFLATION) TO FDI INFLOWS, WHILE AMONG INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, ONLY CORRUPTION, LARGE SCALE PRIVATISATION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE AND FOREX SYSTEMS, AND OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FDI INFLOWS. PROPERTY RIGHTS FREEDOM AND SMALL SCALE PRIVATISATION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES. WHEN WE REDUCE MULTICOLLINEARITY, WE CONCLUDE THAT GDP P.C., INFLATION, THE TRADE AND FOREX SYSTEMS, CORRUPTION AND OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE REFORM REMAIN SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES IN EXPLAINING THE ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF FDI INFLOWS.
929	CRIME CONTROL HAS LONG BEEN THE PRIMARY GOAL OF CHINA'S PRE-TRIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE GENUINE NATURE OF CRIME CONTROL IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE BY REVIEWING THE HISTORICAL FORMATION OF THIS RATIONALE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, BY LOOKING AT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE-TRIAL PROCESS IN THE DIFFERENT PERIODS SINCE THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE PURSUIT OF CRIME CONTROL IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRE-TRIAL JUSTICE IN CHINA IS UNDER THE PRESSURE OF POLITICAL NEEDS. ALTHOUGH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS SO FAR MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE CHINA'S PRE-TRIAL PROCESS IN TERMS OF ITS PROCEDURALISM AND LEGALIZATION, THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AT THIS STAGE HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT ALTHOUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE OF LAW IS EXPECTED TO IDEOLOGICALLY REVOLUTIONIZE CHINA'S PRE-TRIAL PROCESS, THE DEEP-ROOTED POLITICAL CULTURE OF OVERRIDING POLITICAL STABILITY OVER EVERYTHING IS UNLIKELY TO RULE OUT THE PARTY'S INFLUENCE ON THE PRE-TRIAL PRACTICES.
930	IN THE FACE OF PRESSURES TO EXPAND THE RULE OF LAW, IN 2004, JAPAN INTRODUCED A NEW LAW SCHOOL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PRODUCE MORE AND BETTER QUALIFIED LAWYERS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY THE NEW LAW SCHOOL SYSTEM SOLUTION WAS SELECTED FROM AMONG OTHER ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS REFORMING THE NATIONAL BAR EXAM, ABOLISHING MANDATORY LEGAL TRAINING, REFORMING EXISTING LEGAL EDUCATION, OR REDEFINING THE JURISDICTION OF LAWYERS. I ARGUE THAT THE LAW SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS ADOPTED BECAUSE THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT CO-OPTED PRO-LAW SCHOOL SCHOLARS AND OTHER REFORMISTS. ALTHOUGH AMERICAN-STYLE LAW SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN JAPAN, POWER HAS NOT YET SHIFTED ENTIRELY FROM THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT TO THE PRO-LAW SCHOOL SCHOLARS; WHILE THE LEGAL ESTABLISHMENT MAY NO LONGER HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THE JAPANESE JUDICIAL ARENA, IT REMAINS POWERFUL BECAUSE IT SUCCESSFULLY CO-OPTED PRO-AMERICAN ELITES INTO JUDICIAL REFORM. BY ANALYZING THE CASE OF THE JAPANESE LAW SCHOOL SYSTEM, THIS ARTICLE INDICATES THAT TRANSPLANTS OF GLOBAL INSTITUTIONS MAY OFTEN BE MORE SYMBOLIC THAN PRACTICAL DUE TO CO-OPTATION TACTICS USED BY POWERFUL LOCAL ACTORS.
931	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE PROSPECTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN NON-WESTERN SOCIETIES. IT FOCUSES ON SOUTH AFRICA, ONE OF THE NEWEST AND MOST ADMIRED LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, AND IN PARTICULAR ON ITS EFFORTS TO RECOGNIZE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN TRADITIONS SURROUNDING WITCHCRAFT AND RELATED OCCULT PRACTICES. IN 2004, PARLIAMENT PASSED A LAW THAT PURPORTS TO REGULATE CERTAIN OCCULT PRACTITIONERS CALLED TRADITIONAL HEATERS. TODAY, LAWMAKERS ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO GO FURTHER AND CRIMINALIZE THE PRACTICE OF WITCHCRAFT ITSELF. THIS ARTICLE PRESSES TWO ARGUMENTS. FIRST, IT CONTENDS THAT THE 2004 STATUTE IS COMPATIBLE WITH LIBERAL PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL CITIZENSHIP AND THE RULE OF LAW. SECOND, IT WARNS AGAINST OUTLAWING WITCHCRAFT AS SUCH. SUBJECTING SUSPECTED SORCERERS TO CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT BASED ON GOVERNMENTAL DETERMINATIONS OF GUILT THAT MANY WILL PERCEIVE TO BE UNPRINCIPLED WOULD WORK TOO MUCH DAMAGE TO INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND NATIONAL UNITY, AMONG OTHER VALUES. THESE ARGUMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF LIBERALISM TO RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL RESURGENCE OF RELIGIOUS TRADITIONALISM, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE TRADITIONALISTS MAY COMPRISE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENRY.
932	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXTEND THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON INTERNET ADOPTION AND CORRUPTION BY ANALYZING THE FACTORS IMPACTING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF INTERNET ADOPTION ON CORRUPTION REDUCTION IN THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (BENIN, BURKINA FASO, CAPE VERDE, COTE D'IVOIRE, GAMBIA, GHANA, GUINEA, GUINEA-BISSAU, LIBERIA, MALI, NIGER, NIGERIA, SENEGAL, SIERRA LEONE, AND TOGO). THE STUDY USES FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECT PANEL DATA TECHNIQUES COVERING 17 YEARS (2003-2019), TO EXPLOIT THE TIMES SERIES NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ITS DETERMINANTS. IN ADDITION, IT AIMS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF INTERNET ADOPTION ALONG WITH OTHER CONTROL VARIABLES ON CORRUPTION. THE ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOW THAT PER CAPITA INCOME, HUMAN CAPITAL, AGE, POPULATION DENSITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN ECOWAS. THE FINDINGS REVEAL ALSO THAT INTERNET ADOPTION AFFECTS POSITIVELY THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION CONTROL; THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASE IN INTERNET USERS OF 1% IMPLIES AN INCREASE IN CORRUPTION CONTROL BETWEEN 0.05% AND 0.06%.
933	THE SURVIVAL OF AUTHORITARIANISM HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES IN RECENT YEARS. APART FROM POWER SHARING WITHIN THE RULING GROUP AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY, THE FOCUS IS ALSO ON HOW AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES CONSOLIDATE THEIR POWER THROUGH "RULE BY LAW." BY ANALYZING AND COMPARING VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE DATA IN CHINA, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT THE CCP DID BECOME MORE PROACTIVE IN ITS LEGISLATION DURING THE XI PERIOD. THERE WAS A RAPID INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BILLS, FASTER DELIBERATION, AND A SHIFT IN THE MAJOR DRAFTING AUTHORITIES FROM THE FORMER STATE COUNCIL TO THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC) AND SPECIFIC PARTY-STATE INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS REGARD, COMPREHENSIVE LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE STRENGTHENS RULE BY LAW RATHER THAN THE RULE OF LAW. A REVISION OF THE ORGANIC LAW OF THE NPC, RENDA ZUZHI FA] IN 2021 INCREASED THE POWER OF THE NPC STANDING COMMITTEE (NPCSC), AND LEGISLATION WAS MADE MORE FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT. THE LAW ALSO STRENGTHENED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE LEGISLATING AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.
934	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE SCOPE AND LIMITS OF THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION (ART. 47 CFR) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY (CFSP). THIS RIGHT HAS BEEN BROADLY INTERPRETED BY THE ECJ IN A WAY THAT TRANSFORMS THIS POLICY. THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION IS USED AS A VEHICLE TO ASSERT THE COURT'S JURISDICTION BUT ALSO TO EXTEND ACCESS TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO THIRD COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF FORMER HEADS OF STATE OR GOVERNMENT WHO ARE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE BROAD SCOPE OF THE RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, RESULTING FROM VARIOUS STRANDS OF THE CASE LAW, IS A WELCOME DEVELOPMENT IN THE CFSP, WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE NATURE OF THE EU AND WITH ITS FOUNDING VALUES. YET, IN THE VENEZUELA RULING (CASE C-872/19 P), THE INTERPRETATION OFFERED BY THE ECJ STRETCHES THE LIMITS OF ARTICLE 47 CFR AND OF THE RULE OF LAW TOO FAR.
935	THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION IN THE HEALTH SECTOR DURING TROIKA'S INTERVENTION PERIOD (2011-2015), TAKING AS CRITERION THE CONCERN WITH THE APPLICATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES, IN TERMS OF DEGREE AND DIVERSITY. THE INTENTION IS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PUBLIC ACTION PROMOTED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS DEVELOPED SEEKING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. FIFTY MEASURES OF THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, DISTRIBUTED BY NINE INTERVENTION AREAS, WERE ANALYZED, BASED ON DOCUMENTAL ANALYSIS, SUPPORTED ON THE LAW AND ON OTHER OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE THAT DEMONSTRATE A MORE TRANSVERSAL CONCERN ARE CLEARLY THAT OF "TRANSPARENCY" AND OF "EFFECTIVENESS/EFFICIENCY", PRESENT IN EIGHT OF THE NINE INTERVENTION AREAS. THE CONCERN WITH "ORIENTATION TO CONSENSUS" IS ESSENTIALLY PRESENT IN THE MEASURES CLASSIFIED AS AGREEMENTS, "INDEPENDENCE" IN THE ETHICS AREA, THE "STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW" IN THE CONTROL AREA AND "EQUITY/INCLUSION" IN THE AREA OF THE CITIZEN IN THE CENTRE OF THE NHS.
936	BASED ON EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS OF CANADIAN JUDGES, THIS PAPER EXPLORES TWO DISTINCT WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO SENTENCING. THE FIRST OF THESE HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND VIEWS HARSH SENTENCES AS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENCE OF A PUBLIC THAT HAS BEEN POLITICALLY CONSTRUCTED AS BEING REPRESSIVE. THE SECOND HAS ITS ORIGINS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND CONSIDERS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED AS THE BEST WAYS TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENCE OF A WHOLE OTHER PUBLIC, NAMELY ONE THAT IS VIEWED AS BEING LEGALLY WELL INFORMED. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT, WHILE THE FIRST PERSPECTIVE ENCOURAGES HARSHER PUNISHMENT AND A WORRYING RISE IN PENAL POPULISM, THE SECOND RESISTS AND IS PROTECTED FROM THIS BY ITS STRICTLY LEGAL FOUNDATIONS. AS SUCH, IT CAN - AND SHOULD - SERVE AS A BASIS FOR REFORM OF THE POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE.
937	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE COOPERATION OF FRONTEX WITH THIRD COUNTRIES IN INFORMATION SHARING IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH EU'S CONSTITUTIONAL NORMATIVE RULES AND VALUES. SINCE MORE THAN A DECADE, BORDER CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS POLICIES INSTRUMENTAL TO MIGRATION CONTROL. THE SHIFT TOWARDS RISK MANAGEMENT IN MANY AREAS OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE HAS IMPLIED THAT EU'S ACTION AT THE EXTERNAL BORDERS IS BUILT UPON A COMBINATION OF POLICIES OF SECURITIZATION OF MIGRATION AND EXTERNALIZATION OF BORDER MANAGEMENT. AGAINST THIS THEORETICAL BACKGROUND, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EXTERNAL COMPETENCES OR POWERS OF FRONTEX, MAPPING IN PARTICULAR PRACTICES OF INFORMATION SHARING WITH THIRD COUNTRY AUTHORITIES, WHICH ARE FUNCTIONAL TO RISK ANALYSIS, ONE OF THE CORE TASKS OF FRONTEX. IT ANALYSES WORKING ARRANGEMENTS, INTELLIGENCE SHARING COMMUNITIES AND COOPERATION TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE ARTICLE FURTHER DISCUSSES THE LEGAL CHALLENGES THESE TYPES OF COOPERATION BRINGS TO THE EU, AS A GOVERNANCE SYSTEM BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THESE ARE INDICATED IN TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY CHALLENGES.
938	RECENT RESEARCH HAS PROVIDED BROAD ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HIGH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS; BUREAUCRATS SHOULD BE IMPARTIAL AND RECRUITED ON MERIT, PUBLIC POWER SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRIVATE GAIN, THERE SHOULD BE RULE OF LAW, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS SHOULD BE SECURE. MANY SCHOLARS ARGUE THE REASON WHY, IN SPITE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE, RECENT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS HAVE HAD LIMITED SUCCESS IS THAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF INCUMBENT ELITES. CONSTRAINING ELITES IS, THEREFORE, CRUCIAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION FUNCTIONS AS ONE SUCH CONSTRAINT ON ELITE BEHAVIOR, AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO FORM COLLUSIVE COALITIONS. WHEN THE ECONOMY IS CONCENTRATED TO A FEW SECTORS, ELITE INTERESTS ARE MORE UNIFORM MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ORGANIZE. HOWEVER, AS THE ECONOMY BECOMES MORE DIVERSE, COLLUSION BECOMES HARDER AND ELITES MUST SETTLE FOR IMPARTIAL INSTITUTIONS MORE OFTEN. I TEST THE THEORY USING CROSS-NATIONAL TIME SERIES DATA COVERING THE LAST 25 YEARS; THE RESULTS CORROBORATE THE THEORY, AS THE ECONOMY OF A COUNTRY BECOMES MORE DIVERSE, INSTITUTIONS BECOME MORE IMPARTIAL.
939	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS EVIDENCE OF A GLOBAL TREND OF AUTOCRATIZATION. THE MOST VISIBLE FEATURE OF DEMOCRACY - ELECTIONS - REMAINS STRONG AND IS EVEN IMPROVING IN SOME PLACES. AUTOCRATIZATION MAINLY AFFECTS NON-ELECTORAL ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY SUCH AS MEDIA FREEDOM, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND THE RULE OF LAW, YET THESE IN TURN THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THE MEANINGFULNESS OF ELECTIONS. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVES UNDER DEMOCRATIC RULE, 2.5 BILLION PEOPLE WERE SUBJECTED TO AUTOCRATIZATION IN 2017. LAST YEAR, DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES WERE IN DECLINE IN 24 COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD, MANY OF WHICH ARE POPULOUS SUCH AS INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES. THIS ARTICLE ALSO PRESENTS EVIDENCE TESTIFYING THAT MEN AND WEALTHY GROUPS TEND TO HAVE A STRONG HOLD ON POLITICAL POWER IN COUNTRIES WHERE 86% OF THE WORLD POPULATION RESIDE. FURTHER, WE SHOW THAT POLITICAL EXCLUSION BASED ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS IN PARTICULAR IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY SEVERE. FOR INSTANCE, THE WEALTHY HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POWER IN COUNTRIES HOME TO 1.9 BILLION OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION OVER THE PAST DECADE.
940	CONSTITUTIONAL LAW INCLUDES PRINCIPLES OF ESSENTIAL INTEREST TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THEORETICALLY HOW CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY INFLUENCES FINDING SOLUTIONS TO CONFLICTS OF HIERARCHY, JURISDICTION AND COMPETITION. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED, WHOSE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF JURISDICTION AND COMPETENCE COMPLEMENT THE ONE OF HIERARCHY, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE AND WHEN DEALING WITH CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT HIERARCHICAL LEVELS, WHEN THIS CASE IS NOT INVOLVED, IT CAN BE CONSIDERED THE OTHER TWO, ON MATTERS OF TERRITORY OR WHERE TWO OR MORE COURTS OR AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN PRESENT, WHICH MAY BE RESOLVED THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE, JUDICIAL OR LEGISLATIVE BODIES, WITH GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE LATTER BODY TO WHICH THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE, REPEAL AND REFORM LAWS. IN CONCLUSION, CONFLICTS OF JURISDICTION CAN BE RESOLVED THROUGH THE DECISIONS OF LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL BODIES, WHILE THE HIERARCHY ESTABLISHES THE VALIDITY OF A HIERARCHICALLY SUPERIOR RULE OVER A LOWER ONE, ALL LEGAL BODIES MUST CONFORM TO CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND NOT CONTRADICT ITS NORMS, SO THAT THE SOURCE OF RIGHT IS THE MAGNA CARTA.
941	THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE PRESENCE OF AN INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATAL CRIMES AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND ACTIVISTS AND INCOME PER CAPITA FOR A GROUP OF 34 COUNTRIES FROM 2002-2013. USING PANEL DATA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES, THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, DEFORESTATION, HOMICIDE RATES, AND NATURAL RESOURCE DEPENDENCE. WE THUS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE SAFETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS, WHERE AT SOME POINT IN COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTAL MURDERS DECREASE WITH ADDITIONAL INCOME. FURTHERMORE, OUR RESULTS OFFER SUPPORT TO THE FINDINGS OF THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF WORKING GROUP II OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH IMPLY THAT PHYSICAL SECURITY IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTES IS LIKELY AN ENVIRONMENTAL AMENITY WHICH IS INCREASINGLY IN DEMAND, ESPECIALLY AS INCOMES GROW. ADDITIONAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BACKGROUND LEVEL OF FATAL CRIMES (EXCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MURDERS) IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MURDERS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCREASED FOREST COVER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MURDERS CAN BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE THEREBY CONFOUNDING FORESTRY-BASED POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS.
942	IN RECENT TIMES, THE DISAFFECTION WITH THE POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY MAINLY DUE TO UNREST SPARKED BY BOTH THE MANAGEMENT OF ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS AS THE REITERATION OF DIFFERENT EPISODES OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION. NO DOUBT THIS HAS INTENSIFIED THE CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION, AS OLD AS THE REPRESENTATION ITSELF, AND EXACERBATED THE CRITICAL ROLE THEY PLAY IN TODAY'S POLITICAL PARTIES. NOT SURPRISINGLY, THESE DYSFUNCTIONS OBSERVED BRING NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF VARYING EXPERTISE AT MANAGING THE PUBLIC INTEREST BUT ALSO MORE STRUCTURAL REASONS SUCH AS THE FACT THAT THE WEAK INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION MECHANISMS HAS LED TO THE STATE PARTIES EXHIBITS AN EXTREMELY OPAQUE AND OPERATING OLIGARCHIC, IN TURN, IS THE SOURCE OF ALL KINDS OF EXCESSES, INCLUDING CORRUPTION OR "COLONIZATION" OF MOST INSTITUTIONS. IN SHORT, THE SO PERVASIVE POWER OF THE PARTIES HAS UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW AND SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITED THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF DEMOCRACY TO LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR CITIZENS TO DECIDE ON THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY. THIS SITUATION CALLS FOR A GREATER BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN IT AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES.
943	THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON TENGIZ, A MULTINATIONAL OIL PROJECT SITUATED ON THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF THE CASPIAN SEA IN KAZAKHSTAN, OPERATED BY CHEVRON SINCE 1993. THE FIRST LARGE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP IN THE POST-SOVIET SPACE, TENGIZCHEVROIL WAS CELEBRATED AS A "MODEL" ENTERPRISE FOR EAST-WEST COOPERATION AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR. IN 2005-2008, ITS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SUSTAINED OPERATIONS OF NEARLY 100 COMPANIES THAT EMPLOYED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IRONICALLY, THE ECONOMIC BOOM AT TENGIZ THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED BUSINESS MARKET AND LABOR DEMAND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WORKER RIOTS IN 2004-2006. THE RIOTS TOOK PLACE WITHIN A SECURE INDUSTRIAL ENCLAVE THAT HAD BEEN CREATED AS PART OF THE CORPORATE EFFORT TO PROTECT THE OIL COMPANY'S INVESTMENT AND TO ENSURE A SMOOTH OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE TENGIZ ENCLAVE AND THE UNDERLYING FORCES THAT SHAPED LAWLESS PRACTICES WITHIN IT, INCLUDING CORRUPTION AND LABOR ABUSES THAT SPARKED THE RIOTS. IT ALSO EXPLAINS THE FAILURE OF THE STATE TO BRING THE RULE OF LAW TO TENGIZ CONNECTING LAWLESSNESS TO INTERNATIONAL OIL CONTRACTS.
944	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES EVIDENCE OF, AND PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO, SECRECY-RELATED INFORMATION ACTIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED TO CIRCUMVENT ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT POLICY AND LAW. THESE INFORMATION ACTIONS MAY ALSO BE USED TO COVER UP SUCH CIRCUMVENTIONS AFTER THE FACT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SECRECY AS A NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTION AND ITS IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY, SECRECY-RELATED INFORMATION ACTIONS ARE DESCRIBED ACCORDING TO METHODS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT. NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTIONS ARE WILLFUL AND DELIBERATE ACTS DESIGNED TO KEEP GOVERNMENT INFORMATION FROM THOSE IN GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC ENTITLED TO IT. NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTIONS SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES. NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTIONS USED BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO VIOLATE POLICIES AND LAWS DURING THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR ARE IDENTIFIED, ANALYZED, AND CATEGORIZED BY TYPE. THE RELATIVE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTIONS ON ENLIGHTENED CITIZEN UNDERSTANDING IS DEMONSTRATED USING A NEGATIVE INFORMATION ACTION MODEL BY ASSIGNING A LOCATION ACCORDING TO TYPE ON A CONTINUUM OF ENLIGHTENED CITIZEN UNDERSTANDING. FINDINGS ARE COMPARED WITH DEMOCRATIC THEORY AND CONSPIRACY DOCTRINE.
945	IN THE ABSENCE OF SECURE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, NEO-CLASSICAL POLITICAL ECONOMY WOULD HAVE EXPECTED CHINA AND VIETNAM TO PERFORM BADLY. HOWEVER, BOTH ECONOMIES HAVE RECORDED RAPID GROWTH IN RECENT DECADES. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN THIS THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPERTY RIGHTS REGIME IN STATE ENTERPRISES IN VIETNAM'S SECOND CITY AND COMMERCIAL CENTRE, HO CHI MINH CITY. IT ARGUES THAT BY THE LATE 1990S THE PROPERTY REGIME IN MANY FIRMS IN THE CITY HAD EVOLVED SO FAR THAT THEY HAD BEEN EFFECTIVELY PRIVATISED. ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS RESTED NOT ON THE RULE OF LAW BUT ON THE ABILITY OF A COMPANY'S REAL OWNERS TO RESIST OUTSIDE ENCROACHMENT. THIS IN TURN HAD TO DO WITH THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF CLIENTELIST INTERESTS LOCATED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE PARTY-STATE, ALTHOUGH NOT PERFECT, PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE ON THIS BASIS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR AND ENFORCEABLE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH TO OCCUR. THE ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED WITH TWO CASE STUDIES WHICH OFFER RICH INSIGHTS INTO THE REAL NATURE OF PROPERTY UNDER A REFORMING STATE SOCIALIST REGIME.
946	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE DETERMINANTS OF MILITARY SPENDING IN AFRICA BY CONSIDERING THE ROLE PLAYED BY INSTITUTIONS. WITH DATA OBTAINED BETWEEN THE YEARS 1996-2019, THE DRISCOLL AND KRAAY FIXED EFFECTS, THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM), AND THE BAYESIAN MODEL AVERAGING (BMA) ESTIMATORS ARE USED. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GOVERNMENT SIZE, TRADE FREEDOM, ECONOMIC RISK, AND POLITICAL RISK DECREASE MILITARY SPENDING, WHEREAS GOVERNMENT STABILITY AND MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS ARE FOUND TO RAISE IT. USING ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES, WE FIND THAT CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISH MILITARY SPENDING IN AFRICA. IN ADDITION, CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS, THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT TRADE OPENNESS AND TOTAL NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING, WHILE GDP PER CAPITA, INFLATION, AND FOREIGN DEBT STOCKS INCREASE IT. LOOKING AT STRATEGIC DETERMINANTS, ARMS IMPORTS, URBAN POPULATION, AND ETHNIC TENSIONS POSITIVELY AFFECT AFRICAN MILITARY EXPENDITURES. ROBUSTNESS CHECKS SHOW THAT THESE RESULTS CHANGE ONCE REGIONAL SPECIFICITIES ARE CONSIDERED. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS COULD BE AN ENGINE FOR EVOLUTION IN AFRICA'S MILITARY SPENDING.
947	THE BRAZILIAN CASE OF LAVA JATO STARTED WITH A SCANDAL INVOLVING THE MASSIVE MALFEASANCE OF CORPORATE AND POLITICAL ELITES IN RELATION TO THE STATE-RUN OIL COMPANY PETROBRAS. THE SCOPE OF THE CORRUPTION WAS UNPRECEDENTED. POLITICIANS AND PETROBRAS EMPLOYEES RECEIVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS (IF NOT BILLIONS) OF DOLLARS IN KICKBACKS BETWEEN 2004 AND 2012. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INNOVATIONS PROMOTED BY THE LAVA JATO CASE. THIS NEW JURISPRUDENCE HAS NOT ONLY PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN BREAKING A LONG-LASTING TRADITION OF IMPUNITY IN BRAZIL, BUT IT HAS ALSO GENERATED MUCH CONTROVERSY. ON THE ONE HAND, MANY BRAZILIAN CITIZENS WELCOMED THE CHANGES, AS THEY ALLOWED JUDGES TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES FACED BY COURTS IN PREVIOUS CORRUPTION CASES. ON THE OTHER HAND, OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT THE CASE IS NOT SOLIDLY GROUNDED IN RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. INSTEAD OF TAKING SIDES IN THIS DEBATE, THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO REFRAME IT BY ARGUING THAT THERE MAY BE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NOVEL INTERPRETATIONS, BUT THERE MAY ALSO BE COSTS AND RISKS.
948	I COME TO GRIPS WITH THE DEONTOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROPORTIONALITY THAT ASSERTS THAT THIS DOCTRINE IGNORES RIGHTS AND SLIPS INTO THE UTILITARIAN MAXIMISATION OF SOCIETAL INTERESTS. I OFFER A FOUR-PRONGED CLASSIFICATION OF THE DEONTOLOGICAL STRUCTURES UNDERLYING THE SETTLEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF RIGHTS AND PRINCIPLES. TWO OF THESE STRUCTURES ARE SCALAR: BALANCE DEONTOLOGY AND THRESHOLD DEONTOLOGY. THE OTHER TWO ARE NONSCALAR: DEROGATION DEONTOLOGY AND HIERARCHY DEONTOLOGY. I ARGUE THAT PROPORTIONALITY RELIES ON THE SCALAR STRUCTURES, BUT NONETHELESS SETS MUCH STORE BY RIGHTS. THEREFORE, THE DEONTOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF PROPORTIONALITY IS MISPLACED. HOWEVER, I CLAIM THAT PROPORTIONALITY IS SIMILAR TO UTILITARIAN BALANCING IN ITS PRACTICAL IMPORT. LIKE UTILITARIAN BALANCING, PROPORTIONALITY ALLOWS JUDICIAL ARBITRARINESS BY RECOMMENDING COURTS TO ADOPT AN INTUITIONIST DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURE. BASED ON THIS POINT, I OFFER A REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPORTIONALITY. INSTEAD OF AN INTUITIONIST APPROACH, I DEFEND A COMMITTAL METHOD OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION BASED ON HIERARCHY DEONTOLOGY. THE POINT OF THIS PROCEDURE IS TO INTRODUCE PRIORITY RULES VIA MORAL DELIBERATION. I SUBMIT THAT A RULE-BASED KIND OF DEONTOLOGISM COHERES BETTER WITH RULE OF LAW VALUES.
949	IN RECENT YEARS, LEADING MEMBERS OF RUSSIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAVE ADAPTED THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY TO THE RUSSIAN LEGAL CONTEXT, TO EXPLAIN AND LEGITIMIZE THE COUNTRY'S AUTHORITARIAN TURN UNDER PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. THIS DEVELOPMENT REFLECTS A BROADER TREND IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, WHERE POPULIST AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC LEADERS SEEK TO IDENTIFY "NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS" THAT CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO LAW AND LEGAL PRACTICES ON THE DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, IN ORDER TO DENY OR RESTRICT CERTAIN BASIC PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND/OR HUMAN RIGHTS. IN RUSSIA, SEVERAL OFFICIALS AND POLICY MAKERS, AMONG THEM CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT VALERY ZORKIN (2018), HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISCUSSION. WE ARGUE THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY DISCOURSE HAS BEEN USED BY RUSSIAN COURTS TO EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW ON THE ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN STATE AND ITS SUBJECTS. WE PLACE THIS DEBATE IN ITS WIDER LEGAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT AND HIGHLIGHT HOW IT CONFORMS WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION INTRODUCED IN SPRING 2020.
950	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES CHANGES IN THE PREFERENCES CONCERNING RESTRICTIONS ON MINORITY FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF EQUITIES AMONG POWERFUL GROUPS OF DOMESTIC ASSET HOLDERS IN RUSSIA. IN THREE EPISODES BETWEEN 1992 AND 2006, LOCAL BUSINESS INTERESTS OPPOSED THE EASING OF THE RULES FOR MINORITY FOREIGN OWNERSHIP WHILE THEY COMPETED FOR CONTROL OVER DISPUTED ASSETS. ONCE THEY GAINED OUTRIGHT CONTROL OF THOSE ASSETS, THE WINNING GROUPS BEGAN FAVORING LOWERING THE BARRIERS TO PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT INFLOWS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS LIQUIDITY AND INVESTMENT, AND ALSO AID THEIR EFFORTS TO LEGITIMIZE OWNERSHIP RIGHTS. THIS ACCOUNT OF FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN RUSSIA SUGGESTS THAT DOMESTIC ECONOMIC ELITES CHANGE THEIR PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL OPENNESS POLICIES DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF ONGOING CONTESTS FOR CONTROL OVER THE RELEVANT ASSETS. SCHOLARS OF FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES SHOULD CONSIDER HOW CONTESTABILITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN INFLUENCE THE PREFERENCES OF KEY DOMESTIC GROUPS TOWARD POLICIES THAT ENABLE OR RESTRICT THE PROCESS OF FINANCIAL INTERNATIONALIZATION.
951	THE MECHANISM OF PREVENTIVE NON-CONVICTION-BASED SEIZURE AND CONFISCATION OF ASSETS DERIVED FROM CORRUPT ACTS OFFERS AN INTRICATE INTERPLAY OF CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAW NORMS. THE PREVENTIVE SEIZURE AND CONFISCATION APPROACH IS ANALYZED AS TO ITS FUNCTIONS, PURPOSES, AND NORM-CHANGING EFFECTS. THE NORMATIVE CHANGE IS OBSERVED IN THE PREVENTIVE CONFISCATION AS THE DECISION OF THE JUDICIAL OR QUASI-JUDICIAL ORGANS IS BASED ON THE DEGREE OF DANGER POSED BY THE RELEVANT PERSON AND CORRUPT ACTIVITY ON A SUSPICION-BASED INQUIRY, THUS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR CRIMINAL CONVICTION. THE NORMATIVE SIDE OF THE MECHANISM OF PREVENTIVE CONFISCATION SEEKS TO IMMUNIZE THE LAWFUL ECONOMY FROM A CONTAMINATION BY THE ILL-PROCURED ASSETS THROUGH CORRUPTION. THE APPROACH INCLUDES VARIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PREVENTIVE MECHANISM ALSO FOCUSES ON MEASURING THE LIKELIHOOD TO COMMIT ILLEGAL ACTS IN THE FUTURE, AND MANAGEMENT AND USAGE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ILLEGAL CORRUPT ACTIVITY FOR SOCIALLY ORIENTED GOALS.
952	THE QUESTION OF HOW ORDINARY COURTS IN NEW AND EMERGING DEMOCRACIES MAY GAIN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE REMAINS AN UNDERSTUDIED SUBJECT COMPARED TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL COURT COUNTERPART. THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF TAIWAN, THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS AND EXPANDS UPON THE CONCEPT OF POWER DIFFUSION FROM THE EXTANT LITERATURE, ARGUING THAT THE GROWING POWER OF TAIWAN'S PRIVATE CORPORATE SECTOR LED THE DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY KUOMINTANG (KMT) TO GRANT INDEPENDENCE TO THE ORDINARY COURTS AS A MEANS TO CHECK AGAINST THIS THREAT, BECAUSE THE EXCESSIVE RENT-SEEKING AND CORRUPTION BROUGHT ABOUT BY THESE EMPOWERED CORPORATIONS WERE THREATENING THE NATION'S SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC MODEL AND ITS RULE OF LAW. ALSO, DUE TO THE CORPORATE SECTOR'S GROWING INFLUENCE ON THE RULING PARTY ITSELF, THE KMT LEADERSHIP HAD TO DEVISE STRATEGIES THAT CAN CREDIBLY COMMIT TO ORDINARY COURT INDEPENDENCE, WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE REVERSED THEREAFTER. THIS UNIQUE IMPLICATION GUIDES A QUALITATIVE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS THAT REINTERPRETS THE HISTORICAL EVENTS SURROUNDING THE JUDICIAL REFORMS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE MID-1990S. THE RESULTS YIELD STRONG EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY.
953	THIS PAPER ENCAPSULATES THE OUTPUTS OF A SWISS AGENCY FOR DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION (SDC) FUNDED PROJECT THAT AIMED TO IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF HIV GOVERNANCE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL IN MALAWI AND ZAMBIA BY ENCOURAGING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN AN EFFORT TO MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF LOCAL RESOURCES. THE METHODOLOGY FOR THIS PROJECT, DEVELOPED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR DEMOCRACY IN AFRICA (IDASA) AND SDC, INCLUDED A BAROMETER WHICH ASSESSED PERCEPTIONS OF DISTRICT HIV GOVERNANCE AMONG KEY STAKEHOLDERS. PERCEPTIONS WERE GATHERED ON GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION AND EQUITY. THE STAKEHOLDERS RANGED FROM ADMINISTRATORS, POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANISATIONS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON THE SUPPLY SIDE AND CITIZENS ON THE DEMAND OR BENEFICIARY SIDE. THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH INDICATE SPECIFIC SECTOR GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT MAY BE GENERALISED TO GOVERNANCE. COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY APPEAR TO BE MAJOR ISSUES UNDERPINNING THE BOTTLENECKS AND SHORTCOMINGS IN THE HIV SECTOR GOVERNANCE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. INFORMATION GAPS HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ACCOUNTABILITY DEFICITS AND COORDINATION DEFICIENCIES. ADDRESSING THESE MATTERS WOULD MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES AND LESSEN DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL FUNDING SOURCES.
954	THIS ARTICLE INTEGRATES PREVIOUSLY MISSING COMPONENTS OF GOVERNMENT QUALITY INTO THE GOVERNANCE-PIRACY NEXUS IN EXPLORING GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS BY WHICH GLOBAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF IPRS ARE EFFECTIVELY TRANSMITTED FROM INTERNATIONAL TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL IN THE BATTLE AGAINST PIRACY. IT ASSESSES THE BEST GOVERNANCE TOOLS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST PIRACY AND UPHOLDING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPRS). THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF IPR LAWS (TREATIES) IN TACKLING PIRACY THROUGH GOOD GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS IS ALSO EXAMINED. FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT: (1) WHILE ALL GOVERNANCE TOOLS UNDER CONSIDERATION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE INCIDENCE OF PIRACY, CORRUPTION-CONTROL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON; (2) BUT FOR VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY, IPR LAWS (TREATIES) ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN TACKLING PIRACY THROUGH GOVERNMENT QUALITY DYNAMICS OF RULE OF LAW, REGULATION QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, CORRUPTION-CONTROL, AND PRESS FREEDOM. HENCE, THE NEED FOR A POLICY APPROACH MOST CONDUCIVE TO EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT IS TO IMPLEMENT AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF BOTH IPRS AND COROLLARY GOOD GOVERNANCE POLICIES. MOREOVER, OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE RELEVANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE MEASURES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WISHING TO COMPLEMENT THEIR EMERGING IPR REGIMES.
955	THIS PAPER USES THE METAPHOR OF A PRESSURE COOKER TO HIGHLIGHT HOW WATER PROBLEMS IN SPAIN ARE HIGHLY GEOGRAPHICAL AND SECTORIAL IN NATURE, WITH SOME SPECIFIC HOTSPOTS WHICH RAISE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WHOLE WATER COMPLEX SYSTEM, TURNING MANY POTENTIALLY SOLVABLE WATER PROBLEMS INTO 'WICKED PROBLEMS'. THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE TENDENCY FOR WATER GOVERNANCE TO BE HYDROCENTRIC, WHEN OFTEN THE DRIVERS AND IN TURN THE "SOLUTIONS" TO SPANISH WATER PROBLEMS LIE OUTSIDE THE WATER SPHERE. THE PAPER ANALYZES OF THE CURRENT WATER GOVERNANCE SYSTEM BY LOOKING AT WATER GOVERNANCE AS BOTH A PROCESS, AND ITS KEY ATTRIBUTES LIKE PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY, EQUITY AND RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS AN ANALYSIS OF WATER GOVERNANCE AS AN OUTCOME BY LOOKING AT EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF WATER USE IN SPAIN. IT CONCLUDES ON THE NEED TO HAVE A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE ON THE INTERACTIONS OF WATER GOVERNANCE AS A PROCESS AND AS AN OUTCOME AND POTENTIAL SYNERGIES AND ARGUING THAT WATER GOVERNANCE IS AN INHERENTLY POLITICAL PROCESS WHICH CALLS FOR STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM BY LOOKING AT THE INTERACTIONS OF THESE DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE ATTRIBUTES.
956	AS CHINA BECOMES INCREASINGLY INFLUENTIAL IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINESE ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AND POLICY PROCESSES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN THE RATE AND SCALE OF CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS FROM LOCAL TO INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. CURRENTLY, HOWEVER, CHINESE CONSERVATION VALUES, POLICIES AND PRACTICES ARE NOT WELL-INTEGRATED. WE IDENTIFY FOUR SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO CONSERVATION IN CHINA THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS POOR INTEGRATION: WEAK RULE OF LAW; UNCLEAR LAND TENURE; TOP DOWN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY: AND DISCONNECTS BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION. TO ADVANCE CHINA TOWARD AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SECURE FUTURE, WE SUGGEST THAT COMBINING TRADITIONAL CHINESE ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES WITH CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL CONSERVATION PRACTICES WILL HELP TO CREATE A 'CONSERVATION WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS'. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL VALUES SHOULD REPLACE MODERN SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT. RATHER, WE SUGGEST THAT, GIVEN THE CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN CHINA TODAY, USING TRADITIONAL VALUES TO FRAME CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT MAY CREATE STRONGER SOCIETAL SUPPORT FOR CONSERVATION IMPLEMENTATION.

957	THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE INTERRELATION OF LAW AND ECONOMICS IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PAPER DESCRIBES THE CURRENT PROMOTION OF LAW REFORM BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WORLD BANK AS THE PRODUCT OF NEOLIBERAL ECONOMIC THEORY. THE ANALYSIS EXAMINES THE ROLE OF LAW HISTORICALLY AS AN EXPRESSION OF ECONOMIC ORTHODOXY, ARGUING THAT THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS HAS DETERMINED THE SHAPE OF LAW REFORMS, POINTING THEM TO THE DEFINITION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, AIMING TO SEPARATE POLITICS FROM ECONOMICS. THE RELATIVE FAILURE OF THESE POLICIES IN THEIR APPLICATION TO COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM COMMUNISM LED TO THE EXPANSION OF THE REFORM AGENDA TO INCLUDE MARKET-SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS, AMONG THEM THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER ASSESSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS EXPANSION MEANS THAT THE ROLE OF THE LAW AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF REGULATION TO MARKET HAVE CHANGED SUFFICIENTLY TO DENOTE A POST-WASHINGTON CONSENSUS. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE USE OF LAW REFORM TO IMPOSE WHAT NEOLIBERALISM CONSIDERS 'RATIONAL' SOLUTIONS UNDERMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING AND TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES.
958	WHAT IMPACT HAS THE INTERNET HAD ON AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES? THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF THE CHANGING NATURE OF PUBLIC OPINION AS WELL AS "VIRTUAL" POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN CHINA VIA AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF MESSAGES POSTED ON THE ON-LINE FORUM OF QIANGGUO LUNTAN (STRONG COUNTRY FORUM). THE DISCUSSIONS CENTER ON FOUR SEPARATE YET INTERTWINED CATEGORIES OF ISSUES: (1) THE "SAN-NONG" ISSUE: NONGYE (AGRICULTURE), NONGCUN (VILLAGE), AND NONGMIN (FARMERS); (2) EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY; (3) THE ROLE AND REFORM OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC) AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE (CPPCC); AND (4) THE RULE OF LAW. BY CONTRASTING THE OFFICIAL COVERAGE OF THE THEMES THAT APPEAR IN RENMIN RIBAO (PEOPLE'S DAILY), AN EXPLORATION OF QIANGGUO LUNTAN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REVEAL POLITICAL MEANINGS THAT DEMONSTRATE CHANGING PUBLIC DISCOURSE IN THE PRC AFTER A QUARTER CENTURY OF REFORM AND OPENING UP. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT A NASCENT PUBLIC SPACE FOR "VIRTUAL" CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, ALBEIT WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, CAN BE FOUND IN ON-LINE FORUMS IN CHINA.
959	SOVEREIGN SPREADS AND THE LEVEL OF BUREAUCRATIC DIVERSION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING VARY WIDELY ACROSS EMERGING ECONOMIES AND ARE CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER. WE BUILD A SOVEREIGN DEFAULT MODEL WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSTRAINED TO USE CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS TO DELIVER PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THESE FACTS. THE DIVERSION POLICY PA-RAMETERS ARE ESTIMATED USING DATA ON PUBLIC RESOURCES AND MONITORING EFFICIENCY AND USED TO CALIBRATE THE MODEL. WE USE DATA ON THE AVERAGE GIFT NEEDED TO BE GIVEN TO WIN PUBLIC CONTRACTS IN A COUNTRY AS A MEASURE OF BUREAUCRATIC DIVERSION BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO QUAN-TIFY DIVERSION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES WHEREAS TAX EVASION IS HARD TO MEASURE. WE TIE DOWN THE EFFICIENCY LEVEL TO THE RULE OF LAW INDEX. WE SHOW THAT ECONOMIES WITH LOW MONITORING EFFICIENCY DISPLAY HIGHER DIVERSION LEVELS AND HIGHER DEFAULT RISK (AND SPREADS) THAN THOSE WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY. THESE RESULTS EMERGE BECAUSE DEFAULTS REDUCE DIVERSION LEVELS AND THIS BENEFIT FROM DEFAULT IS HIGHER FOR LOW MONITORING EFFICIENCY ECONOMIES, WHICH ENCOUR-AGES DEFAULT. (C) 2023 ELSEVIER B.V.

960	IN HIS 1786 ESSAY ON THE PANTHEISM CONTROVERSY, 'WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ORIENT ONESELF IN THINKING?', KANT IMPLIES THAT 'THE MAXIM OF REASON'S SELF-PRESERVATION [SELBSTERHALTUNG]' IS REASON'S FIRST PRINCIPLE FOR ORIENTING ITSELF IN THINKING SUPERSENSIBLE OBJECTS. BUT KANT DOES NOT CLEARLY EXPLAIN WHAT THE MAXIM OR PRINCIPLE OF REASON'S SELF-PRESERVATION IS AND HOW IT FITS INTO HIS LARGER PROJECT OF CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY. NOR DOES THE SECONDARY LITERATURE. THIS ARTICLE RECONSTRUCTS KANT'S DISCUSSION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF REASON'S SELF-PRESERVATION IN `WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO ORIENT ONESELF IN THINKING?' IT SUGGESTS THAT THIS PRINCIPLE IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS THE DISCIPLINE OF PURE REASON. THE PRINCIPLE OF REASON'S SELF-PRESERVATION PERFORMS THE SAME METHODOLOGICAL FUNCTION THAT KANT ASSIGNS TO THE DISCIPLINE OF PURE REASON. THIS PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHES THE RULE OF LAW IN REASON AND SUBJECTS REASON TO ITS OWN LAWS. IN SO DOING, IT PREVENTS REASON'S DIALECTICAL ERRORS AND ALSO GROUNDS REASON'S FAITH (VERNUNFTGLAUBE), WHICH IN TURN SYSTEMATICALLY CONDITIONS THE PRACTICAL USE OF REASON.
961	YY THE EXPERIENCE OF COVID-19 HAS TAUGHT US MANY THINGS, NOT LEAST THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT JOHN MILTON TERMED 'GIBBERISH LAW'. LAW DRAFTED AMIDST THE 'THRONG AND NOISES OF IRRATIONAL MEN'. THE CLOSER PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THE ATTEMPT TO REGULATE 'GATHERINGS' DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, INCLUDING THE RE-INVENTION OF A BESPOKE CRIME OF 'MINGLING'. A JURISPRUDENTIAL CURIOSITY WHICH, IT WILL BE SUGGESTED, IS SYMPTOMATIC OF A BROADER MALAISE. AN ASSAULT ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH IS ONLY TOO FAMILIAR; MUCH, IT MIGHT BE SAID, LIKE THE ARRIVAL OF A PANDEMIC. THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE WILL REVISIT THREE PARTICULAR GATHERINGS, IN PART TO DEBUNK THE MYTH OF THE UNPRECEDENTED. BUT ALSO TO INTRODUCE SOME THEMES, LITERAL AND FIGURATIVE, OF MASKING AND MUDDLE. THE CONJURING OF WHAT SHAKESPEARE CALLED 'ROUGH MAGIC'. THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE WILL THEN TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE JURISPRUDENTIAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS CONJURATION. THE FINAL PART WILL VENTURE SOME LARGER CONCERNS, ABOUT THE CRISIS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IN THE 'AGE OF COVID'.
962	THE PHENOMENON OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS DRIVEN MUCH OF THE ATTENTION OF ACADEMICS, PRACTITIONERS AND POLICY MAKERS. A CORRECT AND DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP RATES WILL ADVANCE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF USEFUL MEASURES THAT INCREASE ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED BASED ON AVERAGE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, HOW THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE LEVEL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP VARIES WITH THE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTS TO FILL THE RESEARCH GAPS IN THIS FIELD. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP AT DIFFERENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP LEVELS, THE FUZZY SET QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS APPROACH IS EMPLOYED. RESULTS SHOW THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS IS DETERMINED BY THE COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY: VOICE ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ANALYZE IN FUTURE STUDIES THE MOTIVATION TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR, BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN OPPORTUNITY AND NECESSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
963	THIS CRITICAL STUDY ANALYZES IN DETAIL THE AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF 29 OCTOBER 2015 AND THE AWARD OF 12 JULY 2016 IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ARBITRATION. AFTER BRIEFLY INTRODUCING THE PROJECT AND THE STUDY AND DESCRIBING THE BACKGROUND TO AND COURSE OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ARBITRATION AND THE POSITION OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, THE STUDY MOVES TO ADDRESS ONE BY ONE THE FOLLOWING MATTERS: JURISDICTION; ADMISSIBILITY; HISTORIC RIGHTS; THE STATUS OF CHINA'S NANSHA QUNDAO AND ZHONGSHA QUNDAO; THE LEGALITY OF CHINA'S ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA; DUE PROCESS AND EVIDENCE. THE STUDY CLOSES WITH THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRIBUNAL'S MANY ERRORS DEPRIVE ITS AWARDS OF VALIDITY AND THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. INCLUDED AS ANNEXES ARE FIVE USEFUL OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON JURISDICTION, THE TWO AWARDS, CHINA'S TERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY AND MARITIME RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, AND CHINA'S ADHERENCE TO THE POSITION OF SETTLING THROUGH NEGOTIATION THE RELEVANT DISPUTES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE PHILIPPINES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.
964	WORKERS' REMITTANCE AND COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVED IN SUB-SAHARA AFRICA (SSA) INCREASED FROM USD 1.398 BILLION IN 1980 TO USD 4.834 BILLION IN 2000 AND SOARED TO USD 21.101 BILLION IN 2010. THE IMPACT OF REMITTANCE ON RECIPIENT ECONOMY REQUIRES FURTHER EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION AS THERE HAS NOT BEEN CONSENSUS ON WHETHER REMITTANCE INDUCES FINANCIAL PRODIGALITY OR INVESTMENT IN AFRICA. DIFFERING FROM EXTANT STUDIES, THIS STUDY EMPLOYED RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AS INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THIS IS WITH A VIEW TO EXPLORING HOW INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND FINANCIAL DEPTH INTERACT WITH REMITTANCE TO INFLUENCE INVESTMENT IN 44 AFRICAN COUNTRIES (1995-2010). THE MAJOR FINDING FROM THE STUDY, INTER ALIA, IS THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND FINANCIAL DEPTH PLAY COMPLIMENTARY ROLE IN INFLUENCING REMITTANCE FOR INVESTMENT IN AFRICA. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE IMPACT OF AFRICA'S MONEY IN AFRICA WILL BE ENHANCED IN THE PRESENCE OF RELIABLE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND VIABLE FINANCIAL SECTOR. THUS, THE SIDE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL PRODIGALITY THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH REMITTANCE CAN BE AMELIORATED.
965	THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES IN EAST ASIA HAVE BECOME LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES WITH VIBRANT DEVELOPMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW. SCANT ATTENTION, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN PAID TO PARTICULAR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR EAST ASIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM. THIS PAPER UTILIZES THE APPROACH OF CONSTITUTIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY TO RE-EXAMINE POSTWAR CONSTITUTION-MAKING IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN. IT RE-EXAMINES SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THESE CONSTITUTION-MAKING EXPERIENCES AND ANALYZES THEM FROM FOUR PERSPECTIVES: CONSTITUTION-MAKING AND WAR SITUATIONS, QUESTIONABLE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORSHIP, CONSTITUTION-MAKING AND DECOLONIZATION, AND FINALLY CONSTITUTION-MAKING AND NATIONALISM. BY RECONSTRUCTING THESE POSTWAR CONSTITUTION-MAKING STORIES, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT THE THREE CONSTITUTION-MAKING EXPERIENCES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THREE CONSTITUTION-MAKING MODELS INCLUDING: CONSTITUTION-MAKING AS PROMOTING DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTION-MAKING AS NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, AND CONSTITUTION-MAKING AS NATIONAL INCLUSION. IT CONCLUDES THAT EAST ASIA CONSTITUTION MAKING IS NEITHER OF ANY MERE BORROWING FROM NOR OF ANY RESISTANCE AGAINST "WESTERN CONSTITUTIONALISM." RATHER, POSTWAR CONSTITUTION-MAKING EXPERIENCES IN EAST ASIA HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND RE-DEVELOPED INTO DISTINCTIVE, YET COMPARABLE, MODELS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM FOR GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS TO LEARN.
966	USING CHINA'S 2008 ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX (EIT) REFORM, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF EIT ON CORPORATE INNOVATION COMPREHENSIVELY. BASED ON ACCURATE IDENTIFICATION OF THE DIRECTION OF CHANGES IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE, WE INTRODUCE TWO DUMMY VARIABLES OF TAX RATE DECLINE AND ESCALATION TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF EIT CHANGES SIMULTANEOUSLY. USING THE FIRM-LEVEL DATASET FROM CHINA'S A-SHARE LISTED COMPANIES, WE FIND THAT THE INNOVATION LEVEL OF TAX-RATE-DECLINING ENTERPRISES WILL INCREASE BY 0.2%, WHEREAS THE INNOVATION LEVEL OF TAX-RATE-INCREASING ENTERPRISES WILL DECREASE BY 0.4%. THE DYNAMIC EFFECT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED PROMOTING AND INHIBITORY EFFECTS ARE CONTINUOUS. HETEROGENEITY ANALYSES REVEAL THAT THE CHANGES IN THE EIT RATES HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE INNOVATION LEVEL OF ENTERPRISES WITH HIGH INNOVATION DEMAND, MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES, ENTERPRISES IN A HIGH RULE OF LAW ENVIRONMENT, AND ENTERPRISES IN THE EASTERN REGION. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EIT REFORM ON CORPORATE INNOVATION AND GUIDES HOW TO BETTER OPTIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH POLICIES.
967	THIS SYMPOSIUM WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF "CONTROLLING THE COURT THROUGH A BROKEN CONFIRMATION PROCESS: `HOW TO FIX IT GOING FORWARD?'" BUT BEFORE WE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WE MUST ANSWER: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED? DO WE NEED TO FIX THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS BECAUSE IT ENABLES TROUBLING OUTCOMES OR BECAUSE THE PROCESS ITSELF RAISES CONCERNS? MY ESSAY WILL ADDRESS BOTH QUESTIONS, SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS BOTH A SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEM AND A NORMATIVE ONE. EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS COULD ELICIT DIFFERENT ANSWERS. THE NORMATIVE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS ITSELF UNDERMINES RULE OF LAW AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY (OR AT LEAST ITS APPEARANCE). THE SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEM IS THAT THE COURT'S RULINGS ARE WRONG, OUT OF STEP WITH BROADLY HELD PUBLIC VIEWS, AND DANGEROUS TO DEMOCRACY ITSELF. I ARGUE IT IS MISGUIDED TO THINK WE CAN DEFER FIXING THE SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEM AND ADDRESS ONLY THE NORMATIVE PROBLEM INITIALLY. THIS COURT POSES A DIRECT THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND THUS WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THAT EXISTENTIAL DANGER.
968	TAX COMPLIANCE IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC REVENUES, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES THAT CAN IMPROVE PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC GOODS. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TAX COMPLIANCE (TAXPAYERS' BEHAVIOR), PUBLIC TRUST IN POLITICIANS (TRUST IN AUTHORITIES), AND THE RULE OF LAW (POWER OF THE AUTHORITIES). THE ANALYSIS USES UNBALANCED PANEL DATA FOR 68 COUNTRIES FROM 2007-2017 AND ON CLUSTERS OF COUNTRIES. A POSITIVE SHOCK IN TRUST POSITIVELY AFFECTS TAX COMPLIANCE IN THE SHORT TERM IN THE CASE OF EAST EUROPE, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, AND CONFUCIAN ASIA CLUSTERS. A POSITIVE SHOCK IN POWER POSITIVELY AFFECTS TAX COMPLIANCE IN THE CASE OF THE ANGLO AND AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST CLUSTERS. TRUST AND POWER IMPACT TAX COMPLIANCE AND DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE ANALYZED GROUPS. A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE TAXPAYER MIGHT BE OBTAINED BY PROVIDING WELL-FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS, BEING OPEN AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT THEIR WORK, AND INSTILLING CONFIDENCE. THESE ASPECTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ANY ECONOMY BECAUSE THE RESULTS MAY BE RELATED TO INCREASED COMPLIANCE.
969	IN ITS FIRST SEASON, ISRAELI TELEVISION THRILLER FAUDA PROCLAIMED AN UTTER SYMMETRY BETWEEN ISRAEL "PROPER" AND ITS OCCUPIED TERRITORIES, BY HUMANIZING HAMAS MILITANTS AND TREATING THEM AS EQUALS TO THE ISRAELI CHARACTERS. THROUGHOUT THE STORY THE JEWISH WARRIOR'S BODY BECOMES A SITE FOR THE DETONATION OF EXPLOSIVES AND A POTENTIAL VEHICLE FOR SUICIDE BOMBINGS, IN A FALSE BUT INTRIGUING REENACTMENT OF THE TRAUMA OF THE SECOND INTIFADA, WHICH HAS BEEN REPRESSED IN ISRAELI CONSCIOUSNESS. IN THIS UNWITTING MANIFESTATION OF JEWISH MARTYRDOM, THE FACADE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE STATE OF ISRAEL IS DISMANTLED IN WHAT SEEMS LIKE A RELIGIOUS BATTLE BETWEEN CLANS. THE DISCOURSE OF PAIN IN THE SERIES SUGGESTS A STREAM OF CONSTANT RETRIBUTION IN A VICIOUS CIRCLE THAT CAN NEVER HISTORICIZE THE ALLEGEDLY ETERNAL CONFLICT AND WORK THROUGH ITS TRAUMATIC RESIDUES. NONETHELESS, THIS DYNAMIC OF RETRIBUTION AND MARTYRDOM ALSO INFORMS A MULTILAYERED STRUCTURE WHEREBY THE SECULAR, MODERN JEW RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS BY ENGAGING WITH ARABNESS IN THE THEATRE OF MISTA?ARAVIM: IN BECOMING ARAB HE ALSO BECOMES, FINALLY, A JEW.
970	THE PAPER DEALS WITH AN ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS INFLUENCING THE COUNTRY RISK. WE EXAMINATE ECONOMICAL AND POLITICAL FACTORS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE COUNTRY RISK. WE PROVIDE ASSESSMENT BASED ON COUNTRY THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COUNTRIES FACE, AS WELL AS ON THE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENTS. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PAPER WE PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF COUNTRY RISK, WE DISCUSS IDEAS OF RENOWNED AUTHORS FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN REGARD TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC VARIABLES THAT MIGHT AFFECT COUNTRY RISK. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS AN ANALYSIS CONSISTING OF TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SELECTED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS ON THE RISK OF SELECTED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BASED ON AN ECONOMETRIC MODEL USING PANEL REGRESSION. WE CONCLUDE THE GDP PER CAPITA, INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT, GROSS GOVERNMENT DEBT, CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION AND POLITICAL CONTROL INDEX OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE MAIN FACTORS INFLUENCING COUNTRY RISK IN OUR ANALYSIS. BASED ON THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WE SELECT GROUPS OF COUNTRIES WITH HIGHEST SIMILARIETIES AND ANALYSE THEM IN DETAIL.
971	DRAWING ON MEDIA REPORTS PUBLISHED DURING SOUTH AFRICA'S COVID-19 LOCKDOWN, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT VIOLENT POLICING OF BLACK MEN IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOWNSHIPS WAS DRIVEN BY RACIAL STEREOTYPES WHICH DEPICT BLACK MEN AS UNRULY, DEFIANT, VIOLENT AND AGGRESSIVE. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS' USE OF VIOLENCE IS ROOTED WITHIN THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCT OF HEGEMONIC MASCULINITIES IN WHICH VICTIMS ARE POSITIONED AS VILLAINS, WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS POSITION THEMSELVES AS HEROES WHO ARE SIMPLY ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE USE OF VIOLENCE AFFIRMS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS' SENSE OF MANHOOD WHILE UNDERMINING, SHAMING AND MARGINALISING YOUNG BLACK MEN'S SENSE OF MANHOOD. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE POSITS THAT THE LOCKDOWN REGULATIONS GAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ADDITIONAL POWER AND AUTHORITY, BOLSTERED BY THE PANIC AND FEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID-19, TO FURTHER CRIMINALISE YOUNG BLACK MEN. POLICING IS NOT JUST A SAFETY ACT BUT A GENDERED PHENOMENON WHICH DRAWS ON OTHER DISCOURSES OF RACE AND CLASS IN JUSTIFYING CERTAIN ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST POOR, BLACK WORKING-CLASS MEN.
972	STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION SEEMS TO HAVE "BYPASSED" THE SECONDARY SECTOR IN AFRICA. UNFORTUNATELY, THE NATIONAL EXPERIENCES OF "FACTORY LESS" DEVELOPMENT ARE VERY SCARCE AND IDIOSYNCRATIC TO SERVE AS A MODEL (CADOT ET AL., 2016). THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES BY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS ON THEIR INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCES. DATA USED TO ESTIMATE THE DIFFERENT DYNAMIC PANEL MODELS SPECIFIED WITHIN THE PERIOD 1997-2016 ARE FROM THE WORLDWIDE DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS AND THE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHED LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS AS KEY DETERMINANTS OF INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCES OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO VARIABLES IS ROBUST TO VARIOUS SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES. THE FOLLOWING INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES SEEM TO HAVE THE HIGHEST IMPACTS ON INDUSTRIALIZATION: POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF AFRICAN INSTITUTIONS WILL THEREFORE ALLOW THE CONTINENT TO PERFORM BETTER THAN ITS CURRENT 1.6% SHARE OF THE WORLD WIDE'S MANUFACTURING VALUE ADDED.
973	STUDIES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OVERWHELMINGLY FOCUS ON WHETHER STATES EXPROPRIATE OR PROTECT PROPERTY, OVERLOOKING THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF WHETHER PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS WILL USE STATE INSTITUTIONS. BY CONTRAST, I ARGUE THAT THE SUPPLY OF FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS OFTEN FAILS TO ENSURE FIRMS WILL RELY ON THE STATE FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION. INSTEAD, FIRMS FREQUENTLY AVOID FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND TURN TO ILLEGAL STRATEGIES BASED ON VIOLENCE OR CORRUPTION. WHETHER FIRMS ADOPT LEGAL STRATEGIES DEPENDS ON: (1) FIRM-LEVEL PRACTICES AND BELIEFS THAT IMPEDE THE USE OF LAW, (2) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ILLEGAL STRATEGIES, AND (3) COORDINATION PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM FIRMS' EXPECTATIONS ABOUT EACH OTHER'S STRATEGIES. DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH FIRMS, LAWYERS, AND PRIVATE SECURITY AGENCIES, AS WELL AS AN ORIGINAL SURVEY OF RUSSIAN ENTERPRISES, I ILLUSTRATE HOW "DEMAND-SIDE" FACTORS LED TO A SURPRISING INCREASE IN RUSSIAN FIRMS' RELIANCE ON FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES NOT ONLY ATTENTION TO STATE INSTITUTIONS' EFFECTIVENESS, BUT ALSO TO PRIVATE ACTORS' STRATEGIES.
974	STARTING WITH A CURSORY HISTORY OF THE CONCEPTS "RECHTSSPRICHWORT" ('LEGAL PROVERB'), "RECHTSSPRUCH" ('LEGAL RULING') AND "RECHTSSATZ" ('LEGAL PRINCIPLE') THIS PAPER SHOWS (I.) THE FUNCTION OF THE IMAGINARY (III.) AND DISCURSIVELY BASED LEGAL PROVERBS IN KAFKA'S NOVEL "THE TRIAL". K. BELIEVES THAT THE LEGAL PROVERBS ARE THE LINGUISTIC EXPRESSION OF LEGAL RULINGS AND THEREFORE GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW. CONSEQUENLY HE BASES HIS DEFENCE ON LEGAL PRINCIPLES (IV., VI.), WHICH HE BELIEVES, WRONGLY OF COURSE, TO BE ANCHORED IN THE CRIMINAL LAW OF HIS TIME. THIS POSITION IS, HOWEVER, UNDERMINED BY THE NON-CODIFIED, ORAL TRANSMISSION OF LEGAL RULINGS. THE ARGUMENT OF THE GAOLER SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THEM TO LEGITIMISE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW WHICH IS NOT REGULATED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION BY PRE-EXISTING WRITTEN TEXTS, AS IN CONSTITUTIONAL STATES, BUT IN WHICH LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW COINCIDE (V., VII., VIII.). I WOULD LIKE TO ARGUE THAT THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW BECOMES REALITY IN THE INQUISITORIAL LOGIC OF THE PERMANENT PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION IN WHICH K. FINDS HIMSELF (II.).
975	INDICATORS ARE RAPIDLY MULTIPLYING AS TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND PROMOTING A VARIETY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND REFORM STRATEGIES AROUND THE WORLD. THERE ARE INDICATORS OF RULE OF LAW, INDICATORS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN, AND INDICATORS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AMONG MANY OTHERS. INDICATORS ARE WIDELY USED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. THERE ARE INCREASING DEMANDS FOR "EVIDENCE-BASED" FUNDING FOR NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR THE RESULTS OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS TO BE QUANTIFIABLE AND MEASURABLE. THE RELIANCE ON SIMPLIFIED NUMERICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF COMPLEX PHENOMENA BEGAN IN STRATEGIES OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND HAS RECENTLY MIGRATED TO THE REGULATION OF NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE TURN TO INDICATORS IN THE FIELD OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INTRODUCES A NEW FORM OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR RELATIONS OF POWER BETWEEN RICH AND POOR NATIONS AND BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE DEPLOYMENT OF STATISTICAL MEASURES TENDS TO REPLACE POLITICAL DEBATE WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. THE GROWING RELIANCE ON INDICATORS PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF THE DISSEMINATION OF THE CORPORATE FORM OF THINKING AND GOVERNANCE INTO BROADER SOCIAL SPHERES.
976	THE PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DELIBERATIVE PROCEDURES OF POLITICAL WILL FORMATION TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES TODAY. TO BEGIN WITH, FOUR FUNCTIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY ARE DISTINGUISHED: SECURING INTERNATIONAL PEACE, GUARANTEEING LEGAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL PEACE DOMESTICALLY, AND PRODUCING GOOD ACTIVE CITIZENS. THE FOLLOWING PART OF THE ARGUMENT DISTINGUISHES FOUR STRUCTURAL FEATURES CHARACTERISTIC OF DEMOCRATIC REGIMES: STATENESS, RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL COMPETITION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE RULERS. THIRDLY, A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTS CONCERNING DEMOCRACY'S ACTUAL FAILURES AND SYMPTOMS OF MALFUNCTIONING IS PRESENTED. IN THE FINAL SECTION, TWO FAMILIES OF INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED AS REMEDIES FOR THE OBSERVED DEFICIENCIES OF DEMOCRACY ARE EXPLORED: THOSE LEADING TO A BETTER AGGREGATION OF GIVEN PREFERENCES OF THE CITIZENS AND THOSE AIMED AT IMPROVING THE PROCESS OF PREFERENCE FORMATION ITSELF. IT IS THE LATTER, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE FIELD OF DELIBERATIVE POLITICS THAT IS INVESTIGATED AT SOME LENGTH. BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF DELIBERATIVE PROCEDURES AND ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF DELIBERATIVE STRUCTURES ARE DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE THEORY AND EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY.
977	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH GUARANTEES THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, IN THE CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING FROM NON-VIOLENT DIRECT ACTION BY PROTESTERS AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IT DOES SO WITH REFERENCE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE'S ADVISORY OPINION IN THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS CASE, STRASBOURG CASE LAW, AND DOMESTIC CASES IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS WERE PROSECUTED FOR CAUSING DAMAGE AT MILITARY BASES. IT ARGUES THAT SINCE THE RULE OF LAW IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, INTERFERENCE BY A STATE WITH THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION CANNOT BE 'NECESSARY IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY' FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 10(2) UNLESS IT IS SHOWN TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW. IT ALSO REVEALS THE POTENTIALLY POWERFUL INTERACTION OF NATIONAL LAW, INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT REMARKS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF SELF-HELP AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.
978	THE CONTEMPORARY DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF EUROPEAN POLITICS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON TWO THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES. THE MORE PESSIMISTIC ANALYSTS PREDICT A GROWING INSTABILITY IN EUROPE. THEY FOCUS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF OVERALL POWER RESOURCES IN EUROPE AND, HENCE, DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF BOTH THE END OF BIPOLARITY AND THE PRESUMED RISE OF A UNITED GERMANY'S POWER. THE MORE OPTIMISTIC ANALYSTS BUILD THEIR HOPES ON THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES IN EASTERN EUROPE WHICH COULD LEAD TO A PEACEFUL ZONE OF CIVIL SOCIETIES AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ALL OF EUROPE. THE LATTER VIEW PERCEIVES THE DOMESTIC STRUCTURE OF STATES AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR SHAPING INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. BY CONTRAST, WE CONTEND THAT BOTH APPROACHES EXHIBIT WEAKNESSES BY NOT ACCOUNTING FOR THE ADVANCED INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF CONFLICT MANAGEMENT IN EUROPEAN POLITICS. INSTEAD A THIRD PERSPECTIVE IS OFFERED WHICH IMPLIES A DISTINCT INTERPRETATION OF THE HISTORY AS WELL AS THE PRESENT STATE OF EAST-WEST RELATIONS AND, FURTHER, SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THE PREREQUISITES OF AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR, STABLE PEACE IN EUROPE.
979	THE 'FREE ENTERPRISE' SYSTEM IS A NORMATIVE CORNERSTONE OF MANY LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONS AND A FORMATIVE PRINCIPLE OF NEOLIBERAL LEGALITY. HOWEVER, THE WAY IN WHICH THIS ECONOMIC MODEL SHAPES THE LEGAL FIELD AND CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED. THOUGH LAWYERS, JUDGES, AND LEGAL EXPERTS HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LEGAL BUTTRESSING OF THE FREE ENTERPRISE MODEL, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE SHAPING OF NEOLIBERAL LEGALITY FROM THE PERIPHERY OF THE JURIDICAL SYSTEM. WE ARGUE THAT THE RISE OF NEOLIBERAL LEGALITY IN LATIN AMERICA OWES MUCH TO THE LEGAL IMAGINARY CRAFTED BY BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS. IN LINE WITH THIS, WE EXAMINE THE 'NORM ENTREPRENEURSHIP' UNDERTAKEN SINCE THE 1940S BY AN ORGANIZATION BARELY NOTED IN MAINSTREAM HISTORIES OF NEOLIBERALISM: THE INTER-AMERICAN COUNCIL FOR COMMERCE AND PRODUCTION (IACCP). DRAWING ON THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND ARCHIVAL WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE IACCP'S ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE TO GIVE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SOCIAL LEGITIMACY AND ESTABLISH FREE ENTERPRISE AS A SOCIO-LEGAL NORM AND A SOURCE OF PUBLIC LAW.
980	AFRICA, OVER THE PAST YEARS, HAS PUT VARIOUS MEASURES IN PLACE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CARBON EMISSIONS. ACHIEVING NET ZERO CARBON HAS CAUSED THE CONTINENT RESEARCHERS TO INVESTIGATE VARIOUS CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. THEREFORE, THE POLITICAL SYSTEM CANNOT BE LEFT OUT SINCE IT PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN DECISION-MAKING. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO PREVIOUS LITERATURE ANALYZING THE EMPIRICAL EFFECT OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON CARBON EMISSIONS. THE STUDY IS FOCUSED ON 52 AFRICAN COUNTRIES WITH DATA FROM 1996 TO 2021. PANEL QUANTILE AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS ARE USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE RESULT INDICATES THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTRIBUTES TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL STABILITY WHICH PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION; HOWEVER, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RENEWABLE ENERGY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH PROMOTE ECOLOGICAL SUSTAINABILITY. ACCORDING TO THE AFOREMENTIONED, IT IS CRUCIAL FOR GOVERNMENTS TO INCLUDE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES, PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE IN AFRICAN NATIONS. FURTHERMORE, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD PUT RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE TO CONTROL THE TRADE OF HIGH-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES.
981	DISCIPLINE FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND OFFICIALS IS A SPECIFIC TYPE OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, PRESCRIBED BY LAW AND ARISING ON THE BASIS OF LAW. THE LAW ON DISCIPLINE FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND OFFICIALS REPRESENTS THE INEVITABLE TREND OF A DEMOCRATIC, FAIR, AND CIVILIZED STATE -THE RULE OF LAW. THE STATE MANAGES SOCIETY BY LAW, WHICH MEANS THAT THE STATE HAS USED THE LAW TO INFLUENCE AND REGULATE SOCIAL RELATIONS IN ORDER TO STABILIZE AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL ORDER. IT IS NECESSARY TO REALIZE THAT DISCIPLINING CIVIL AND OFFICIALS IS A FORM OF HANDLING OFFICIAL ERRORS, THEREBY IMPROVING PUBLIC SERVICE ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, CERTAIN PRINCIPLES MUST BE ADHERED TO IN PUNISHING PEOPLE WORKING FOR STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS. ON THE BASIS OF STUDYING THEORETICAL ISSUES RELATED TO DISCIPLINING; LEGAL DOCUMENTS OF THE STATE OF VIETNAM, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO FIND OUT THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CIVIL SERVANT DISCIPLINE AND OFFICIAL DISCIPLINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH VIETNAM LAW; POINTED OUT A NUMBER OF LEGAL INADEQUACIES, THEREBY PROPOSING SOME SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE LAW ON DISCIPLINING CIVIL SERVANTS AND OFFICIAL IN THE FUTURE.
982	THE STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER EFFECTIVE AUDIT COMMITTEES, GENDER-DIVERSE BOARDS, AND CORRUPTION CONTROLS AFFECT THE LEVEL OF VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES OF ASIAN BANKS. FURTHER, WE ANALYZE WHETHER DIRECTORS' EXPERIENCE MODERATES THE IMPACT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE INDEPENDENCE, AUDIT COMMITTEE MEETINGS, BOARD GENDER DIVERSITY, AND CORRUPTION CONTROLS ON VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES. WE USE DATA FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS OPERATING IN SIX ASIAN COUNTRIES, I.E., CHINA, INDIA, PAKISTAN, MALAYSIA, HONG KONG, AND SINGAPORE. FOR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS, WE APPLY SEVERAL ROBUST STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. WE FIND THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS WITH EFFECTIVE AUDIT COMMITTEES, GENDER-DIVERSE BOARDS, AND CORRUPTION CONTROLS TEND TO DISCLOSE LESS INFORMATION VOLUNTARILY AS THEY PERCEIVE LIMITED BENEFITS FROM OPTIONAL DISCLOSURES. FURTHER, WE FIND UNIQUE EVIDENCE THAT DIRECTORS' EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATES THE IMPACT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE INDEPENDENCE, AUDIT COMMITTEE MEETINGS, BOARD GENDER DIVERSITY, AND CORRUPTION CONTROLS ON VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURES OF ASIAN BANKS. OUR UNIQUE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPRIETARY COST THEORY. FURTHER, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS OPERATING IN COUNTRIES THAT MAINTAIN RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS TEND TO DISCLOSE LESS INFORMATION VOLUNTARILY.
983	THIS CONTRIBUTION IS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BOLOGNA PROCESS IN THE STUDIES OF LAW, AS IT ENTAILED THE COMMODIFICATION OF THE CURRICULUM THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF PRIVATE INTERESTS IN DETERMINING THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE DEGREE. THIS, NOT ONLY WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE VALUE OF EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE AS COMMON AND STRUCTURAL GOODS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY, BUT ALSO IMPLIED THE INCORPORATION OF THE HUMAN CAPITAL THEORY IN THE CREATION OF THE NEW ACADEMIC CURRICULA, CORNERING SUBJECTS RELATED TO RIGHTS HUMAN RIGHTS, PHILOSOPHY OR THEORY OF LAW, ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW, DEONTOLOGY OF LAW, AMONG MANY OTHERS, WHICH HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THIS PROCESS AND THE NEOLIBERAL VALUES PROMOTED BY GLOBALIZATION. FACED WITH THIS REALITY, WHICH POSES A DANGER TO THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW STATE ITSELF, THE INCORPORATION OF THE LEGAL CLINICAL MODEL IS SUGGESTED, IN ORDER TO RECOVER SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BOLOGNA PLAN LEFT ASIDE, CONSIDERED AS BASIC IN THE TRAINING OF FUTURE LEGAL EXPERTS.
984	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO QUALITATIVELY ASSESS THE SCOPE OF DIASPORA CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH MACEDONIA. THE AUTHOR'S KEY ARGUMENT IS THAT DIASPORA PRESENTS AN INDISPENSABLE SOURCE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR HELPING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. THE AUTHOR COLLECTED QUALITATIVE DATA AND USED EXISTING QUANTITATIVE DATA, AND SET THEM IN AN EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DIASPORA WORKS POSITIVELY FOR THE ECONOMIC AND, BROADLY SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH MACEDONIA. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN ASSESSED AS POSITIVE. THE MORE SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE EXISTING ON THE ROLE OF REMITTANCES IN DEVELOPMENT SUPPORTS THEIR POVERTY-ALLEVIATION ROLE, AS WELL THEIR ACTING AS INFORMAL SOCIAL PROTECTION FOR THE RECEIVING HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT IN NORTH MACEDONIA'S DEVELOPMENT REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERUTILIZED, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF DIASPORA INVESTMENT. THE INSUFFICIENTLY SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IN DEALING WITH THE ISSUE, GOVERNMENT INEFFICIENCY AND THE PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND THE (DEFICIENCY IN) RULE OF LAW ARE IDENTIFIED KEY STUMBLING BLOCKS.
985	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO APPREHEND THE JOHN DEWEY'S SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY AS A HERMENEUTIC STANDPOINT FOR THE ENRICHED READING AND PRACTICE OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO EDUCATION, UNDER THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. TO THIS END, IT PERFORMS A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH, REVIEWING THE AUTHOR'S MAIN WORKS ON THE SUBJECT. WITHIN THE PRAGMATIST PHILOSOPHICAL RECONSTRUCTION PROPOSAL, EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY ARE UNDERSTOOD AS INSEPARABLE COMMUNICATIVE EXPERIENCES. THEY COULD PERFORM THE EMANCIPATION'S PROJECT OF ENLIGHTENMENT. BEYOND THE POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION, THE DEMOCRACY ARISES AS COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE OF SOLVING SOCIAL CONFLICTS. EDUCATION IMPLIES THE ENDLESS PROCESS OF COGNITIVE AND MORAL GROWTH. IT MEANS LEARNING OF THINKING, ACTING AND LIVING TOGETHER REFLECTIVE HABITS, IN DIALOGICAL INTERACTION. IT INVOLVES AN EDUCATIVE EXPERIENCE, CONSTITUTED BY THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES: DERIVATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT OF LIFE EXPERIENCES; EDUCATION BASED ON PROBLEM SOLVING; PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL CONTENT; DIALOGICAL INTERACTION; AND PEDAGOGICALLY ORIENTED EDUCATION. IN THIS WAY, EDUCATION LEADS THE INDIVIDUAL TO MORAL-COGNITIVE AUTONOMY, AND AT THE SAME TIME EMPOWERS HIM TO THE COMMUNITARIAN AND SHARED EXPERIENCE WHICH CHARACTERIZES DEMOCRACY.
986	WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO CONTRACT SINCE GRANT GILMORE FAMOUSLY PRONOUNCED IT DEAD IN 1974? THIS ARTICLE POINTS A WAY PAST THEORETICAL PARALYSIS CAUSED BY THE PERPLEXING MISMATCH BETWEEN DOCTRINE DEVISED FOR LIVING AND BREATHING CONTRACTS, AND BEHAVIORS OF COURTS AND CONTRACTING PARTIES PRODUCED BY WHAT WE REFER TO AS "ZOMBIE EXCHANGE." "ZOMBIE CONTRACTS" ARE NOT THE SAME AS CONTRACTS PRODUCED FROM WHAT WE CALL "ARCHETYPAL EXCHANGE," BUT IT IS OFTEN HARD NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGAL FORM IN WHICH ZOMBIE CONTRACTS CLOTHE THEMSELVES. YET INDIVIDUALS LIKELY FEEL THE PRE-MORTEM PULL OF A MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO AS PROMISED BECAUSE THE ZOMBIE CONTRACT USES THE SHELL OF ARCHETYPAL EXCHANGE TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION OF A PROMISE THAT SHOULD BE KEPT. THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHY CONTRACT ZOMBIFICATION IS COSTLY: INDIVIDUALS TRUST THE RULE OF LAW LESS, RESPECT CONTRACTS LESS, ARE LESS ABLE AND LESS WILLING TO CONSUME IMPORTANT DISCLOSED INFORMATION, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO RETALIATE IN ASOCIAL OR ILLEGAL WAYS. WE ULTIMATELY PROPOSE A MEANS OF REDUCING THESE COSTS WITH AUGMENTED TRANSPARENCY THROUGH A NEUTRAL SOURCE.
987	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS A LITTLE-KNOWN PROVISION OF AUSTRALIAN STATUTE LAW WHICH CONDITIONS THE RIGHT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS COURTS ON THE PERMISSION OF A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. THIS PROVISION RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION PROTECTS THE RIGHT OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO ACCESS AUSTRALIAN COURTS TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR CLAIMED WRONGS. SEVERAL ARGUMENTS ARE MADE. FIRST, RULE OF LAW CONCERNS WITH LIMITS TO THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO PRACTICALLY ACCESS COURTS ARE CONSIDERED. A RELATED, BUT SEPARATE, ARGUMENT MIGHT BE MADE FROM THE HIGH COURT'S PAST ACCEPTANCE OF NOTIONS OF "EQUAL JUSTICE". IT CONSIDERS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPLIED RIGHT TO ACCESS COURTS, SOURCED IN CH III OF THE CONSTITUTION. IT CONSIDERS WHETHER A RIGHT TO ACCESS COURTS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE EXISTING IMPLIED FREEDOM OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION, SINCE MANY CLAIMS AFFECTED BY THIS APPROVAL REQUIREMENT WOULD CONCERN ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC FUNCTIONS. FINALLY, IT CONSIDERS WHETHER CONDITIONING THE HEARING OF A LEGAL ACTION ON THE PERMISSION OF A PUBLIC OFFICIAL MIGHT OFFEND THE "INSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY" OF A CH III COURT.
988	SINCE THE LATE 1990S, THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF SCHOLARSHIP ON SOUTH ASIAN LEGAL HISTORY. THIS ARTICLE SITUATES THE NEW LITERATURE WITHIN THE LONGER TRADITION OF POSTCOLONIAL SOUTH ASIAN LEGAL STUDIES, FOCUSING ON WORK WRITTEN BY LAWYERS AND HISTORIANS. THE FIRST WAVE OF SOUTH ASIAN LEGAL STUDIES EMERGED IN WHAT HISTORIANS WOULD CALL THE LONG 1960S FROM A GROUP OF AMERICAN LAWYERS AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WORKING ON THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE EXPERIENCE OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN INDIA. THE SECOND WAVE, WHICH HAS CONCENTRATED ON THE THEMES OF GENDER AND RELIGION IN BRITISH INDIA, HAS BEEN SHAPED BY DIFFERENT INFLUENCES, NAMELY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INDIAN WOMEN'S MOVEMENT AND IN INDIAN LEGAL EDUCATION DURING THE 1980S AND 1990S. THE SURVEY CONSIDERS WHETHER THE NEW SCHOLARSHIP IS OVERLY FOCUSED ON ELITES, THE STATE, THE COLONIAL PERIOD, AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SOURCES. IT ALSO IDENTIFIES REGIONAL CROSSCUTTING THEMES THAT HAVE GENERATED RESEARCH ON SOUTH ASIA BEYOND INDIA, PARTICULARLY CONSTITUTIONALISM, STATES OF EMERGENCY, AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION; BUDDHIST LEGAL STUDIES; GENDER; AND RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.
989	FOOD SECURITY IS RELATED TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL MANKIND LIFE, SOCIAL HARMONY AND NATIONAL STABILITY. THE EXISTING RELATED FOOD SAFETY LEGAL SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY HAS MANY DEFECTS; RESEARCH ON THE ASPECT OF FOOD SAFETY LEGAL SYSTEM HAS A GAP COMPARED WITH THE WESTERN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. STUDY OF FOOD SAFETY LEGAL SYSTEM HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR IMPROVING THE CURRENT SITUATION OF FOOD SAFETY SUPERVISION, PROMOTING THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF FOOD INDUSTRY, ENHANCING THE SUPERVISION EFFICIENCY OF REGULATORS, AND MAINTAINING THE SOCIAL STABILITY. BASED ON THE COMPARISON OF CHINESE AND FOREIGN FOOD SAFETY LEGAL SYSTEM, THIS PAPER ANALYZED THE CURRENT SITUATION AND EXISTING PROBLEMS OF FOOD SAFETY LEGAL SYSTEM AND DREW LESSONS FROM LAW SYSTEM OF FOREIGN ADVANCED FOOD SAFETY. IN ADDITION, THIS ARTICLE BUILT A NEW SCIENTIFIC IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PUT FORWARD SOME FEASIBLE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE CONCEPTS OF FOOD SAFETY AND THE DEFECTS OF THE LAW SYSTEM OF FOOD SAFETY IN CHINA COMBINED WITH THE REALITY OF OUR COUNTRY.
990	AFGHANISTAN IS A STATE PARRY TO INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) AND OBLIGED TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE ALLEGATIONS OF WAR CRIMES, GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN THE COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS INTO WAR CRIMES IN AFGHANISTAN, THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE THE CRIMINALS, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS (NGOS) IN ADDRESSING THE PAST AND PRESENT WAR CRIMES. IN THIS CONTEXT, NGOS CAN RAISE THEIR VOICE FOR ICC INVESTIGATIONS WHICH WILL PRESSURIZE GOVERNMENT IN TAKING NECESSARY STEPS TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ENABLE IT TO INVESTIGATE WAR CRIMES AND NAB THE PERPETRATORS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT, DUE TO THE INABILITY AND UNWILLINGNESS OF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE, NGOS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FURTHERING THE AIMS OF THE ICC IN AFGHANISTAN BY HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE THOSE MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES. NONETHELESS, THERE HAS TO BE CLOSE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL CIVIL SOCIETY TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND PUTTING AN END TO THE CULTURE OF IMPUNITY FOR STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.
991	THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION CONFRONTS THE GROWING PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION BY PROVIDING FOR THE PROMPT RETURN OF THE CHILD TO THEIR HOME COUNTRY. HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATION THAT IMPLEMENTS THE HAGUE CONVENTION IN THE UNITED STATES CONFERS CONCURRENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION FOR CASES BROUGHT UNDER THE TREATY. THIS VAST JURISDICTIONAL GRANT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO DELAY IN CASE RESOLUTION, INCONSISTENT INTERPRETATION, AND UNRESOLVED CASES AND HAS FRUSTRATED THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION WHICH SEEKS TO EXPEDITE THE CHILD'S RETURN. AT THEIR CORE, HAGUE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS ARE CHOICE OF FORUM CASES IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT AND THE CONVENTION DEPENDS ON RECIPROCITY AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AMONG CONTRACTING STATES. CONSOLIDATING HAGUE CONVENTION PROCEEDINGS WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WOULD ENCOURAGE UNIFORM INTERPRETATION OF TREATY PROVISIONS AND ALLOW EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP AMONG JUDGES. THIS WILL PROMOTE THE INTERESTS OF PARENT AND CHILD VICTIMS BY FACILITATING THE PROMPT RETURN AND EVENTUAL RESOLUTION OF THE UNDERLYING CUSTODY CONTROVERSY WHILE STRENGTHENING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PERFORMANCE UNDER THE HAGUE CONVENTION.
992	THIS ARTICLE RETRACES THE HISTORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO NORMATIVE TECHNIQUES WHOSE COMPETITION BECAME CLEAR FROM THE END OF THE 18(TH) CENTURY: "LAW" AND "MEASURE". BASED ON A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF FRENCH AND GERMAN SOURCES OF THE LAST TWO CENTURIES, THE AUTHOR FOCUSES ESPECIALLY ON THE CONCEPT OF MESURE DE POLICE OR POLIZEI MASSNAHME IN ORDER TO DISCOVER THE VERY CHARACTER OF AN INSTITUTION, THE POLICE, WHICH DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE CLASSICAL DISTINCTION OF CONTINENTAL LEGAL SYSTEMS BETWEEN LAW AND FACT. DESPITE OF THE GUARANTEES OFFERED BY A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, POLICE CLAIMS "FREE HANDS", NAMELY THE IGNORANCE OF THE LAW. THUS ITS POWER IS GROUNDED ON A RELATIVE CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE RULE AND THE EXCESS, THE TAMING OF THE SITUATION BEING THE REAL CRITERION THE POLICE FORCE IS LED BY. RECENT EVENTS LIKE THE MISUSES OF POLICE DURING THE G8 IN GENOA IN 2001 CONFIRM THE LONG LASTING HISTORY OF AN INSTITUTION WHICH CAN HARDLY FIND A COMPROMISE WITH THE IDEA OF LIMIT.
993	WHAT CONSTITUTES 'LAW' IN THE EFFLORESCENT FIELD OF 'GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A 'SOCIAL FACT' CONCEPTION OF LAW, EMPHASIZING SOURCES AND RECOGNITION CRITERIA, BUT IT EXTENDS THIS HARTIAN POSITIVISM TO INCORPORATE REQUIREMENTS OF 'PUBLICNESS' IN LAW. 'PUBLICNESS' IS IMMANENT IN PUBLIC LAW IN NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC JURISPRUDENCE, AND INCREASINGLY IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, WHERE IT APPLIES TO PUBLIC ENTITIES RATHER THAN TO IDENTIFIABLE GLOBAL PUBLICS. PRINCIPLES RELEVANT TO PUBLICNESS INCLUDE THE ENTITY'S ADHERENCE TO LEGALITY, RATIONALITY, PROPORTIONALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND SOME HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE GROWING USE OF PUBLICNESS CRITERIA IN PRACTICES OF JUDICIAL-TYPE REVIEW OF THE ACTS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE ENTITIES, IN REQUIREMENTS OF REASON-GIVING, AND IN PRACTICES CONCERNING PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY. ADHERENCE TO REQUIREMENTS OF PUBLICNESS BECOMES GREATER, THE LESS THE ENTITY IS ABLE TO RELY ON FIRMLY ESTABLISHED SOURCES OF LAW AND LEGAL RECOGNITION. 'PRIVATE ORDERING' COMES WITHIN THIS CONCEPT OF LAW ONLY THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. WHILE THERE IS NO SINGLE UNIFYING RULE OF RECOGNITION COVERING ALL OF GAL, THERE IS A WORKABLE CONCEPT OF LAW IN GAL.
994	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES VARIATION IN VOTER SUPPORT FOR EXTREME-RIGHT PARTIES IN EASTERN EUROPE, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE NEW EU MEMBERS. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT IS A REACTION TO CORRUPTION AND THE ABSENCE OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY, AND THAT EXTREMISTS THRIVE IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRACIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK. MOREOVER, IT SHOWS THAT THE ACCESSION PROCESS AND EU CONDITIONALITY CONTRIBUTED TO EMPTYING THE POLICY-ORIENTED ISSUE SPACE, AND THAT AS EU CONDITIONALITY HAS WITHERED AWAY, SO TOO HAVE RAPID IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. VARIATION IN CROSS-NATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE EXTREME RIGHT IS THEREFORE A REACTION TO THE CONVERGENCE OF THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES ON THE MOST SALIENT POLICY ISSUE OF THE LATE 1990S-JOINING THE EU. THE TECHNOCRATIC AND BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OF EU ACCESSION, WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DECLINING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, CONTRIBUTED TO A 'VACUUM' EFFECT IN THE POLICY SPACE THAT LED TO PARTY COMPETITION BASED ON IDENTITY-BASED APPEALS, SUCH AS ETHNIC HATRED, AND SET THE STAGE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE EXTREME RIGHT IN EASTERN EUROPE.
995	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS TWO QUESTIONS: WHY DO ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS SUCH AS THE IMMIGRATION REFUGEE BOARD RESORT TO DEVELOPING GUIDELINES, AND WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES AND VALUES WHICH LEGITIMIZE THESE INITIATIVES? THE ROLE OF TRIBUNALS IN POLICY-MAKING AND/OR POLICY-IMPLEMENTING RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO WHOM ARE TRIBUNALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF GUIDELINES WHERE THE FUNCTIONS OF A TRIBUNAL - ESPECIALLY THE ADJUDICATIVE FUNCTIONS - ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF GOVERNMENT? THE AUTHORS SEEK TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE DYNAMICS OF TRIBUNALS' ROLE IN THE POLICY PROCESS. THEY PROPOSE A CLASSIFICATION OF GUIDELINES BASED ON THE FUNCTION THEY PERFORM IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK UNDERLYING GUIDELINES. THE AUTHORS EXPLORE HOW A LEGAL ANALYSIS OF GUIDELINES MIGHT SHED ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF A NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF GUIDELINES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND UNSTABLE.
996	ALTHOUGH PEACEBUILDERS DO NOT OPERATE FROM A COMMON TEMPLATE, LIBERAL VALUES SO DEFINE THEIR ACTIVITIES THAT THEIR EFFORTS CAN BE CALLED "LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING." MANY POSTCONFLICT OPERATIONS ASPIRE TO CREATE A STATE THAT CONTAINS THE RULE OF LAW, MARKETS, AND DEMOCRACY. GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING IS RE-CREATING THE CONDITIONS OF CONFLICT; STATES EMERGING FROM WAR DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONS OR CIVIC CULTURE TO ABSORB THE PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL AND MARKET COMPETITION. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE PROBLEMS AND DANGERS, THERE IS AN EMERGING CALL FOR GREATER ATTENTION TO THE STATE AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION BEFORE LIBERALIZATION. THESE CRITIQUES, AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM RECENT OPERATIONS, POINT TO AN ALTERNATIVE-REPUBLICAN PEACEBUILDING. DRAWING FROM REPUBLICAN POLITICAL THEORY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES OF DELIBERATION, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND REPRESENTATION CAN HELP STATES AFTER WAR ADDRESS THE THREATS TO STABILITY THAT DERIVE FROM ARBITRARY POWER AND FACTIONAL CONFLICT AND, IN THE PROCESS, DEVELOP SOME LEGITIMACY. REPUBLICAN PEACEBUILDING IS NOT ONLY GOOD FOR POSTCONFLICT STATES; IT ALSO IS APPROPRIATE FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACEBUILDERS, WHO ALSO CAN EXERCISE ARBITRARY POWER.
997	IN THIS ARTICLE, EMPIRICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPMENT IN NORWAY IN THE 19TH CENTURY ARE LINKED WITH THEORETICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING METHODOLOGY. THE TERM "ANALYTIC METHODOLOGY" IS INTRODUCED, AND IT IS CLAIMED THAT ONLY THREE ANALYTICAL LOGICS EXIST: INDIVIDUALISM, COLLECTIVISM AND SITUATIONALISM. THESE FORM THE COMMON METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HISTORY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CONCEPT "HISTORICAL SITUATIONALISM" IS COINED. IT IS ARGUED THAT WE CAN COMBINE INDIVIDUALISM AND COLLECTIVISM, AND CONSTRUCT A METHOD OF SOLVING THE STRUCTURE-ACTOR PROBLEM IF WE INTRODUCE THE HISTORICAL SITUATION-THE TIME-FRAME-AS A THIRD DIMENSION. THIS IS DEMONSTRATED IN MY ACCOUNT OR OUR ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY 1814-1900: THE RELATION BETWEEN POLITICAL ORGANIZATION (ACTOR) AND BUREAUCRATIC PRAXIS (STRUCTURE) WAS DETERMINED BY THE SITUATION. IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY, WE HAVE TWO MAJOR SITUATIONAL TURNING POINTS; THE FIRST IN 1814, WHEN NORWAY CUT LOOSE FROM THE DANISH "ABSOLUTISTIC STATE" AND DEVELOPED A "RULE-OF-LAW STATE," THE SECOND IN 1945, WHEN THE LABOR PARTY CAME TO POWER AND STARTED THE DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS THE "POLITICAL STATE" OF TODAY.
998	THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES STRUGGLE TO ACCOMPLISH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; NEVERTHELESS, ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ISSUES CAN BE RESOLVED BY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION IN THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE COUNTRIES FOR THE TIME PERIOD OF 2002 TO 2019. FIXED EFFECT, OLS, AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT ESTIMATORS WERE APPLIED TO THE PANEL DATA FOR ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOWS THAT ENERGY FROM FOSSIL FUELS, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION BY RISING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSION. RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE AND INNOVATION CLAUDIA CURVE IS VALID IN THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE COUNTRIES. IN THE PRESENCE OF QUALITY INSTITUTIONS, COUNTRIES CAN ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY BY EXPANDING THEIR USE OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS TO THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
999	COVID-19 IS AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS THAT FACES THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD. THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO GOVERNMENT WORK CULTURES, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER HAS SHOWN HOW THESE GOVERNMENTS REACT TO THE CRISIS CAUSED BY COVID-19. WE ANALYSE STRATEGY, POLICY, AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT WHEN FACING COVID-19 AND GIVE A RESULT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRISIS GOVERNANCE FIELD. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARGUE THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN HIGH INCOME, UPPER-MIDDLE INCOME, AND LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES IS GUIDED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES. DATA USED IN THIS RESEARCH WAS OBTAINED FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE WORLD BANK. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAVE GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, SUCH AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION.
