0	THE PROBLEMS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND LEGAL UNCERTAINTY ARE GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FIELD OF LAWMAKING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THUS, THE THREATENING CONSEQUENCES OF THIS ARE THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW AROUND THE WORLD AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF UKRAINIAN CITIZENS APPLYING TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR). THE ARTICLE TRACES THE BRIEF GENESIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF "RES JUDICATA", EMPHASIZES THE VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS AND FORMS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, AND CLARIFIES TWO GROUPS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR IT. IN THE STUDY, THE MAIN ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE PECULIARITIES OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE ARTICLE IS AIMED AT DETERMINING THE FEATURES AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS BASED ON ANALYSIS AND GENERALIZATION OF ECTHR DECISIONS. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT IN THE GENERALIZED FORM THE ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CERTAINTY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDES: REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERPRETATION (IN PARTICULAR, JUDICIAL) OF NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS AND SEPARATE NORMS; LEGALITY OF RESOLVING LEGAL CONFLICTS AND ELIMINATING GAPS IN CURRENT LEGISLATION; STABILITY OF COURT DECISIONS; UNITY OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE. THE CASE LAW OF EUROPEAN JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS IN MATTERS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE POSITION THAT THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN EACH CASE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTS OF THE CASE, THEIR ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF IDENTITY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM, AS WELL AS THEIR PRONENESS, A COMBINATION OF STABILITY AND DYNAMISM, GENERAL AND SPECIAL. RESEARCH METHODS USED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE INCLUDE ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION, DEDUCTION, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, FORMAL-LEGAL AND LOGICAL-LEGAL METHODS.
1	JUDICIAL REFORM IN AFGHANISTAN IS SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED BY SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION THAT HAS RESULTED IN LOW LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE AND WEAK RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS IN THE AFGHAN JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH REFERENCE TO 70 INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN KABUL. BUILDING ON LEGAL PLURALISM AND A POLITICAL ECONOMIC APPROACH, THE SHORTCOMINGS AND CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CORRUPTION IN THE AFGHAN JUSTICE SECTOR ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THESE RANGE FROM LOW PAY, RESULTING IN BRIBERY; CRIMINAL AND POLITICAL INTRUSION INTO THE JUDICIARY; NON-ADHERENCE TO MERITOCRACY, WITH POORLY EDUCATED JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS; AND LOW FUNDING IN THE JUDICIAL SECTOR RESULTING IN WEAK CASE TRACKING AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACHES: UNDERSTANDING CORRUPTION FROM A NON-WESTERN APPROACH AND EMPHASIS ON RELIGION, MORALITY AND ETHICS IN ORDER TO CURB IT.
2	WE ARGUE THAT THE NEOLIBERAL TRADITION AND NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REFORMS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR EFFECTIVELY ERODE THE CORE (LIBERAL) DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND TRANSPARENCY. THE TENSION BETWEEN PUBLIC LAW AND MANAGERIALLY-INFLUENCED GOVERNMENTAL POLICY IS IN PRACTICE RESOLVED BY THE EMERGENCE OF WHAT WE CALL "SHADOW MANAGEMENT" IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHEREBY MANAGERIAL DECISIONS THAT CLASH WITH CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ARE DEALT WITH IN INTERNAL MEMOS OR CONSULTANCY REPORTS AND HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC VIEW. THE CONSEQUENCE IS A DUALITY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, WHICH POTENTIALLY REDUCES PUBLIC TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS AND UNDERMINES THEIR DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY. FINALLY, WE ARGUE THAT WHEN GOVERNMENTAL NEOLIBERAL POLICY CLASHES WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, THE LIKELY EFFECT IS THAT THE POPULAR INSTITUTION OF THE (GOVERNMENTAL OR PARLIAMENTARY) OMBUDSMAN, ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED FOR LEGAL SUPERVISION OVER CIVIL SERVANTS, TAKES ON THE NEW DECEPTIVE ROLE OF PROVIDING PSEUDO-LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR NEOLIBERAL REFORM, MAKING NEOLIBERALISM AND OMBUDSMEN A PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC COMBINATION FROM A DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVE. WE SUPPORT OUR CONTENTIONS BY A CASE STUDY OF SWEDISH HIGHER EDUCATION AND HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE MECHANISMS WE HIGHLIGHT ARE GENERAL IN NATURE.
3	THE CENTRAL AFRICAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY COMMUNITY (CEMAC) IS AN ORGANISATION OF STATES OF THE CENTRAL AFRICA SUB-REGION THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AMONG MEMBER STATES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PLAUSIBLE AIMS AND LAUDABLE OBJECTIVES THAT GAVE RISE TO CEMAC, ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE NOT BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE SYNDROME OF CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL CATALYST TO DEVELOPMENTAL ENDEAVOURS OF GOVERNMENTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE. TO ENABLE THE FULFILMENT OF ITS PRIMARY OBJECTIVES, CEMAC HAS ADOPTED SEVERAL ANTI- CORRUPTION LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. PARADOXICALLY, YEARS AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE LAWS, CORRUPTION INDEXES HAVE CONTINUALLY PORTRAYED CEMAC NATIONS AS TAKING THE LEAD IN THE HIERARCHY AS THE MOST CORRUPT NATIONS IN AFRICA AND THE WORLD AT LARGE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PLACE AND ROLE OF CEMAC AS REGIONAL REGULATOR OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION WITHIN ITS MEMBER STATES. FIRST, THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE LEGAL ANTI-CORRUPTION FRAMEWORK IN CEMAC AND OTHER REGIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION TREATIES IN AFRICA. DOES CORRUPTION NOW NOT MAKE A MOCKERY OF THE PURPOSE OF CEMAC AS WELL AS RAISING QUESTIONS AS TO WHY CEMAC WAS CONCEIVED AND HAS NOT YET DELIVERED? THE ARTICLE UNDERLINES THE GROWING NUMBER OF CORRUPTION CASES AND REPORTS WITHIN CEMAC TO ILLUSTRATE THIS. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EXISTENCE OF CONSTRAINTS ON MEMBER COUNTRIES OF CEMAC IN RELATION TO CORRUPTION. ANTI-CORRUPTION ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ARE REVIEWED AS WELL AS THE LEGAL INCENTIVES FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE INTEGRITY. THIRD, THE ARTICLE SCRUTINISES THE VALUE ADDED BY THE CEMAC TREATY WITHIN THE SUB-REGION OVER THE AFRICAN UNION ANTI-CORRUPTION INSTRUMENT AND CONCLUDES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN CEMAC MEMBER STATES.
4	MANY ASIAN GOVERNMENTS REGARD RUSSIA'S WAR WITH UKRAINE AS A DISTANT EVENT WITH LIMITED IMPACT ON THE REGION BEYOND RAISING FOOD AND ENERGY PRICES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE CONSIDERED THE GEOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE WAR, THEY HAVE LARGELY FOCUSED ON WHETHER IT INCREASES THE RISK OF CHINA ATTACKING TAIWAN. BUT THE WAR HAS STRAINED THE RULE OF LAW AND IS ENTRENCHING DIVISIONS ALONG IDEOLOGICAL LINES, INTRODUCING UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY INTO ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS. IT HAS ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. ASIAN GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE ALERT TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND THEIR NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. FOR THEM TO CONDEMN RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE AND DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW WOULD NOT BE BLINDLY SUPPORTING THE WEST, AND WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THEIR NATIONAL INTERESTS. THE WEST MUST ALSO DO ITS PART TO AVOID WORSENING GEOPOLITICAL FAULT LINES. IN PARTICULAR, FRAMING GREAT-POWER COMPETITION AS A BATTLE BETWEEN AUTOCRACIES AND DEMOCRACIES IS UNHELPFUL.
5	COLOMBIA HAS GONE THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSFORMATIONS IN REGARDS OF JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION ALL OF THEM AIMED AT IMPROVING THE ACCESS TO THE PROCESSES AND THEIR CELERITY. REGARDING THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM, IT WAS PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT AN ACCUSATORY SYSTEM, WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO NEW MEASURES THAT HAVE GENERATED DISCUSSION. ONE OF THEM, MAYBE THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN MORE DEBATED IN THE ACADEMIC FIELD, IS THE PRINCIPLE OF OPPORTUNITY, WHICH GRANTS JUDGES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICE OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS PAPER ANALYZES IF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, ESTABLISHED BY LAW 906 OF 2004, ACHIEVES TO SETTLE THE SOCIAL CONFLICT GENERATED BY CRIME, AS WAS PROPOSED BY THE CRIMINAL PROCESS OF THE SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. FOR THAT PURPOSE THIS PAPER TURNED TO A DOCUMENTAL STUDY AND TO THE FINALISTIC THEORY OF LAW.
6	MATTHEW LEWANS'S AND ADRIAN VERMEULE'S BOOKS DEMONSTRATE THE TRIUMPH OF A THAYERIAN APPROACH TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, WHICH SEES LEGAL INTERPRETATION AS A SHARED ENTERPRISE, OVER A DICEYIAN ONE, WHICH VIEWS IT AS THE EXCLUSIVE PROVINCE OF COURTS. THEIR HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE, AND ANALYTIC TREATMENTS EXPOSE THE DEPTH OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA IN WHICH COURTS HAVE COME TO ACCEPT THAT THE FUNCTIONAL REASONS FOR LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES - SOME COMBINATION OF THE AGENCIES' GREATER EXPERTISE, SPECIALIZATION, CAPACITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY - ALSO JUSTIFY JUDICIAL DEFERENCE. THESE DEMONSTRATIONS REVEAL HOW MUCH OF OUR ACCUMULATED LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RESURGENT DICEYIAN CRITICS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SEEK TO CAST ASIDE. WHILE LARGELY FELLOW TRAVELLERS, THESE BOOKS HOLD DIFFERENT LESSONS ABOUT THE SCOPE AND GROUNDS OF LAW. FOR VERMEULE, THE DIMINISHED PLACE OF COURTS AMOUNTS TO A LARGER ABNEGATION OF LAW. BUT THE RETREAT OF COURTS ENTAILS A RETREAT OF LAW ONLY IF ONE HOLDS ON TO AN IDENTIFICATION OF LAW WITH THE COURTS. IN CONTRAST, FOR LEWANS, LEGITIMATE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO AGENCIES IS CONDITIONED ON AGENCIES COMPLYING WITH THE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES OF FAIR PROCESS AND PUBLIC REASON GIVING. AS A RESULT, FOR LEWANS, JUDICIAL DEFERENCE DOES NOT MARK A DIMINUTION OF LAW BUT, RATHER, AN OCCASION FOR JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL VALUES THAT APPLY INDEPENDENTLY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES. THESE BOOKS THUS LEAVE US TO ASK: DOES LAW DIMINISH AS COURTS RECEDE OR DOES IT STILL INHERE, PERHAPS EVEN MORE URGENTLY, IN ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES?
7	ARMED CONFLICT IS PARTICULARLY DESTRUCTIVE TO SOCIO-LEGAL RELATIONS REGARDING LAND AND PROPERTY. RECONSTRUCTION PRIORITIES INCREASINGLY INCLUDE THE REFORM OF PROPERTY LEGISLATION AS PART OF EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE CAUSES AND REASONS FOR CONTINUATION OF CONFLICTS. HOWEVER, A PERVASIVE PROBLEM IS THAT POSTWAR LAWS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONNECT WITH INFORMAL ON-THE-GROUND DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING PERCEPTIONS OF SPATIALLY-BASED RIGHTS AS POPULATIONS PURSUE LIVELIHOODS, GRIEVANCES AND ASPIRATIONS. LEFT UNATTENDED, THE PROBLEM CONSTITUTES A POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT FOR A RETURN TO CONFLICT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THIS CONNECTION FOR POSTWAR SIERRA LEONE, IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES AND QUESTIONS OF POTENTIAL UTILITY. THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTING POSTWAR LAND TENURE LAWS WITH INFORMAL SOCIO-LEGAL REALITIES. FOR SIERRA LEONE, A PRIMARY ISSUE IS THE PRESENCE OF A LARGE POPULATION WITHOUT ACCESS TO LAND, TENURE INSECURITY DISCOURAGING INVESTMENT, LARGE-SCALE FOOD INSECURITY AND RURAL UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE SIGNIFICANT SWATHES OF ARABLE AND PREVIOUSLY CULTIVATED LAND STANDS IDLE.
8	REVIEWING AND COMMENTING ON LIENAU'S BOOK RETHINKING SOVEREIGN DEBT, POLITICS, REPUTATION, AND LEGITIMACY, THIS PAPER AGREES WITH MOST OF HER POINTS, AIMING AT SUPPORTING AND COMPLEMENTING RATHER THAN CONTRADICTING HER LINE OF ARGUMENT. IT WANTS TO CORROBORATE HER POINTS AS WELL AS TO BRING UP ASPECTS THAT THE BOOK DOES NOT DISCUSS. IT PRESENTS TWO MAIN COMMENTS ON THE MORE CIVILIZED TREATMENT OF SOVEREIGN DEBTORS BEFORE WWII, AND ON THE ROLE OF THE BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTIONS AFTER 1945 THAT - AS LIENAU CORRECTLY NOTES CHANGED THE POSITON OF DEBTORS FUNDAMENTALLY. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT GOING FURTHER BACK INTO HISTORY THAN THE BOOK DID, NAMELY SOVEREIGN DEBTS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, STRONGLY CORROBORATES LIENAU'S LINE OF ARGUMENT REGARDING THE PERIOD BEFORE WWII. THE PAPER COMPLEMENTS THE ROLE OF THE BRETTON WOODS INSTITUTIONS WITH FURTHER FACTS, ARGUING THAT THEIR STRONGLY STATIST VIEW IS ALSO SELF-SERVING AND HELPFUL TO SUPPORT MULTILATERAL LENDING PRACTICES VIOLATING THESE INSTITUTIONS' STATUTES. FINALLY, THE NEW TENDENCY BACK TO A NON-STATIST REGIME SHE RIGHTLY OBSERVES IS COMMENTED ON, POINTING OUT THAT PRESENT DEBT MANAGEMENT IN THE EUROZONE CONSTITUTES A CONSIDERABLE BACKLASH.
9	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES RECENT TRENDS OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND DEPORTATION POLICIES IN FRANCE, FOCUSING ON A MAJOR TENSION WITH WHICH THESE POLICIES HAVE LONG HAD TO ENGAGE. THIS TENSION HAS BEEN BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, A TENDENCY TOWARDS INCREASED REPRESSION OF UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION, AS THIS HAS LED TO A WIDER USE OF DETENTION AND GREATER DISCRETIONARY POWERS FOR FRENCH POLICE AND IMMIGRATION OFFICERS, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FRENCH REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT ENTAIL MINIMUM PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF FOREIGNERS AND A GENERAL LIMITATION OF STATE VIOLENCE AGAINST ALL MIGRANTS. THE ARTICLE FIRST PRESENTS THE FRENCH DETENTION AND DEPORTATION PROCESSES AND A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EVOLUTION. IT THEN RETRACES THE HISTORY OF MIGRANT DETENTION PRACTICES IN FRANCE, AND THE IMPORTANT SHIFTS THEY HAVE UNDERGONE SINCE THE EARLY 2000S. THE LAST SECTION OF THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE TRANSFORMATIONS FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION ON THE GROUND AND FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL MANAGEMENT' OF UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRATION IN FRANCE MORE GENERALLY.
10	CAN, AND WILL, LAWYERS POLICE THEIR CLIENTS? THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE PRIVATE FRONT-LINE WORKERS OF THE FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE ON MONEY LAUNDERING (FATF). THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A STUDY OF HOW SWEDISH LAWYERS PERCEIVE AND HANDLE OBLIGATIONS TO POLICE CLIENTS WITHIN FATF STYLE RISK-BASED ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING/COUNTER TERRORISM (AML/CTF) REGULATION. WE FIND THAT THE LAWYERS WERE RELUCTANT TO TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AML/CTF, AND THAT THEIR FRONT-LINE WORK WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS BEING COMPLIANT ENOUGH. RELATEDLY, WE IDENTIFY SEVERAL PRACTICES OF SEPARATION THAT SERVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE CONFLICTING AIMS AND INTERESTS IN THE EVERYDAY OF THIS FORM OF PRIVATE POLICING. ANOTHER FINDING IS THAT THE LAWYERS BY AND LARGE POSITION THEMSELVES AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ACTORS, AND VIEW RISKS OF AML/CTF AS KNOWABLE. NEVERTHELESS, LAWYERS EXPERIENCED A PRINCIPLE CLASH BETWEEN BEING 'NOT BANKS', AND BEING FRONT-LINE WORKERS FOR FATF. IN PARTICULAR, THE LAWYERS PERCEIVED THEIR ROLE AS FRONT-LINE WORKERS TO BE MORE COMPLEX DUE TO THEIR PROFESSIONAL NORMS AND ETHICS ON CLIENT PRIVILEGE, AND WHAT THEY SAW AS THE PROPER ROLE OF LAWYERS, BEING IN CONFLICT WITH THE OBLIGATION TO REPORT CLIENTS AND THEIR TRANSACTIONS. IN CONCLUDING, WE SUGGEST THAT PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE OF FRONT-LINE WORKERS WHEN DEVISING REGULATORY TOOLS MAY BE A WAY TO PROMOTE ENGAGEMENT IN 'TRUE' CRIME PREVENTION ON THEIR PART.
11	SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998 IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION IN THE USE OF DRUG DETECTION DOGS, THE MOST COMMON TOOL OF OLFACTORY SURVEILLANCE, HAS TAKEN PLACE WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE DEBATE, WITHOUT SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND IN THE ABSENCE OF A CODE OF PRACTICE. IN CONTRAST, THE USE OF THE DOGS IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA AND IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SUPREME COURT DECISIONS, AND IN NEW SOUTH WALES, OF PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION AND AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW BY THE NEW SOUTH WALES OMBUDSMAN. THIS PAPER WILL ARGUE THAT THE DIFFICULT LEGAL ISSUES RAISED BY OLFACTORY SURVEILLANCE ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE RAISED BY OTHER FORMS OF `NEW SURVEILLANCE' IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT THE FAILURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES IN THE CASE OF OLFACTORY SURVEILLANCE COULD AMOUNT TO A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR THE REGULATION OF OTHER SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES.
12	THE 2007 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN KENYA WERE FOLLOWED BY MORE THAN 1,000 DEATHS AND THE FORCIBLE DISPLACEMENT OF PERHAPS 350,000. THIS WAS THE RESULT, IN PART, OF FRUSTRATIONS FROM THE MISCOUNTING THAT ASSURED PRESIDENT KIBAKI'S RE-ELECTION, AND THE ENSUING VIOLENT REPRESSION OF PROTEST AND DISSENT. MOST OF THESE DEATHS AND DISLOCATIONS, HOWEVER, WERE CAUSED BY ETHNIC TERRORISM, UNDERTAKEN PERIODICALLY BY KENYAN POLITICIANS SINCE THE 1991 TRANSITION TO WHAT PAUL COLLIER LABELS 'DEMOCRAZY'. ETHNIC TERRORISM, PART OF THE DYNAMIC OF VIOLENCE THAT OFTEN PLAGUES DEMOCRATISATION IN THE POOREST NATIONS, SEEKS TO ADVANCE THE FORTUNES OF ONE ETHNIC GROUP BY FOSTERING A MILITANT, FEARFUL IDENTITY, AND USES EXTREME VIOLENCE TO SPUR ETHNIC CLEANSING, TO THE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE OF ITS PATRONS. THIS LONG-TERM DYNAMIC IN KENYA HAS FEATURED WIDESPREAD USE OF TRIBAL MILITIAS, SEXUAL VIOLENCE, AND IMPUNITY FOR ITS PERPETRATORS, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE, UNLESS KENYA'S POLITICAL CLASS COMPLIES WITH THE WAKIREPORT, WHICH CALLS FOR THE ORGANISERS AND FINANCIERS OF THE VIOLENCE TO BE PROSECUTED.
13	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW FRENCH LAW DEFINES AND DEALS WITH UNDESIRABLE AND UNRETURNABLE MIGRANTS IN A TIME WHEN THE POLITICAL CONTEXT IS PARTICULARLY TENSE. "UNDESIRABILITY" REFERS TO THE SITUATION OF MIGRANTS WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO A DEPORTATION MEASURE AS THEY ARE DEEMED A THREAT TO PUBLIC POLICY, WHILE "UNRETURNABILITY" REFERS TO MIGRANTS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO A DEPORTATION MEASURE THAT CANNOT BE ENFORCED. I WILL DISCUSS THE WAY FRENCH AUTHORITIES ASSESS THE UNDESIRABILITY OF NON-NATIONALS, AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ENJOY A WIDE DEGREE OF DISCRETION IN THIS RESPECT. I WILL THEN PROPOSE A TYPOLOGY OF THE REASONS FOR UNRETURNABILITY, WHICH ARE NUMEROUS AND NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MIGRANT THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE DEPORTATION MEASURE. FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL FOCUS ON THE TOOLS FRENCH LAW PROVIDES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF UNDESIRABLE AND UNRETURNABLE MIGRANTS. IN THIS RESPECT, I WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE EITHER SUBJECT TO DE FACTO UNLIMITED RESTRICTIONS TO LIBERTY, OR LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES WITH A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THAT COMES WITH LOWERED RIGHTS. WE WILL SEE THAT ULTIMATELY, THEY FIND THEMSELVES TRAPPED BETWEEN LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AND LEGAL LIMBO, THUS THEY ARE "EXPELLED" FROM THE RULE OF LAW.
14	THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS GROWING INCREASINGLY AND THUS IT BECOMES NECESSARY FROM A RULE OF LAW APPROACH TO SET AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF LEGAL GUARANTEES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER A LEGAL CONFLICT ARISES. FURTHER, ACCORDING TO THOSE RULE OF LAW STANDARDS AND THE ORTHODOX PARADIGM, CONTROL AND GUARANTEES PERTAIN ULTIMATELY TO THE JUDICIAL BODIES. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THIS ASPECT FROM A TWOFOLD PERSPECTIVE. ON THE ONE HAND, JUDICIAL BODIES ARE, AS ALREADY STATED, THE LAST RESORT TO CONTROL THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IT NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED, WHETHER ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE, AS IT STANDS TODAY, IS AN ADEQUATE TOOL TO RESPOND TO THAT NEED. THIS QUESTION HAS ALREADY BEEN ASKED BY SOME AND IT REQUIRES FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS SO BECAUSE THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF SELECTING JUDGES AND THE INTERNAL ORGANISATION OF JUDICIAL BODIES PROBABLY REQUIRE A REVISION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY COMPETENCES TO FULFIL THEIR FUNCTIONS. IN THIS SENSE, THE SUPPORT OF TECHNICIANS OR THEIR INTEGRATION IN THE JUDICIAL BODIES THEMSELVES ARE ASPECTS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, ANOTHER TOPIC NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED, NAMELY THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BY JUDICIAL BODIES IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS OR BY OTHER ACTORS TAKING PART IN THE PROCESS. AMONG THE QUESTIONS TO DEAL WITH, A RELEVANT ONE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PREDICTION SYSTEMS CONCERNING JUDICIAL DECISIONS (TO BE MENTIONED HERE ALSO THE RECENT AND POLEMICAL PROHIBITION IN FRANCE REGARDING PUBLICITY OF THOSE DATA) OR USE OF ALGORITHMS IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE.
15	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF VALUE FOR MONEY (VFM) AUDITS WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF COMPLIANCE AUDIT, AND TO CLASSIFY THE PERFORMANCE AUDITS CARRIED OUT BY THE SWEDISH NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE (SNAO) DURING ITS FIRST SIX YEARS AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE AUDIT ORGANIZATION REPORTING TO PARLIAMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE EMPIRICAL DATA WERE GATHERED FROM ALL OF THE 150 AUDIT REPORTS PUBLISHED BY THE SNAO FROM ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 2003 TO THE END OF 2008. SEMINARS WERE ARRANGED TO DISCUSS THE CLASSIFICATIONS FOR VALIDATION. FINDINGS - THE FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL VFM AUDITS (THE "THREE ES") IS UNUSUAL. MOST AUDITS CARRIED OUT BY THE SNAO COMBINE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXTENDED VFM AUDITS WITH COMPLIANCE AUDIT. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY AUDIT HOW THE GOVERNMENT AND/OR CENTRAL AGENCIES FULFIL THEIR MANDATES (FROM GOOD TO BAD). ON THE OTHER, THEY AUDIT HOW THE GOVERNMENT AND/OR CENTRAL AGENCIES ADHERE TO LEGISLATION, RULES AND POLICIES (RIGHT OR WRONG). IN SOME CASES, THE SNAO EQUATES COMPLIANCE AUDIT WITH PERFORMANCE AUDIT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE AUTHORS HAVE VERBALISED AND VISUALISED PERFORMANCE AUDIT ACTIVITIES OF INTEREST NOT ONLY TO STATE AUDITORS, BUT ALSO TO EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. ONE PRACTICAL IMPLICATION IS THAT THE SWEDISH NATIONAL AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE SNAO THAT IS PARTLY BASED ON THE NATIONAL REPORT OF THIS STUDY, AND HAS PROPOSED A STRONGER FOCUS ON THE THREE ES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY ADDRESSES A NEW APPROACH IN TERMS OF A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME FOR PERFORMANCE AUDITS, CONSISTING OF EIGHT TYPES OF VFM AUDITS AND THREE DEGREES OF COMPLIANCE AUDIT, AND CREATING 24 POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS.
16	LIABILITY IN NATIONAL SECURITY MATTERS HINGES ON CURBING BOTH OFFICIAL MYOPIA AND HINDSIGHT BIAS. THE FRAMERS KNEW THAT OFFICIALS COULD BE SHORT-SIGHTED, PRIORITIZING EXPEDIENCE OVER ABIDING VALUES. JUDICIAL REVIEW EMERGED AS AN ANTIDOTE TO MYOPIA OF THIS KIND. HOWEVER, THE FRAMERS RECOGNIZED THAT UBIQUITOUS SECOND-GUESSING OF GOVERNMENT DECISIONS WOULD ALSO BREED INSTABILITY. BALANCING THESE CONFLICTING IMPULSES HAS PRODUCED JUDICIAL OSCILLATION BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND DEFERENCE. RECENT DECISIONS ON BIVENS CLAIMS IN THE WAR ON TERROR HAVE DEFINED EXTREMES OF DEFERENCE OR INTERVENTION. CASES LIKE ASHCROFT V. IQBAL AND ARAR V. ASHCROFT DISPLAY A CATEGORICAL DEFERENCE THAT REWARDS OFFICIALS' MYOPIA. ON THE OTHER HAND, COURTS IN PADILLA V. YOO AND AL-KIDD V. ASHCROFT MANIFEST AN EQUALLY CATEGORICAL INTERVENTIONISM THAT INSTITUTIONALIZES HINDSIGHT BIAS. TO BREAK WITH THE CATEGORICAL CAST OF BOTH DEFERENTIAL AND INTERVENTIONIST DECISIONS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES AN INNOVATION-ELICITING APPROACH. INSPIRED BY REMEDIES FOR COGNITIVE BIAS AND REGULATORY FAILURE, IT GIVES OFFICIALS A STAKE IN DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVES TO BOTH OVERREACHING AND ABDICATION. OFFICIALS WHO CAN DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALTERNATIVES IN OTHER CONTEXTS THAT ARE BOTH PROPORTIONAL AND PROXIMATE IN TIME TO THE INSTANT CASE BUY FLEXIBILITY AND DISMISSAL OF THE LAWSUIT BEFORE THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY PHASE. BY LEVERAGING OFFICIALS' EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE, THE INNOVATION-ELICITING APPROACH TAMES THE "PENDULAR SWINGS" IN POLICY THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY IN BOUMEDIENE V. BUSH VIEWED AS UNDERMINING BOTH LIBERTY AND SECURITY.
17	THIS STUDY USES RULE OF LAW (I.E., INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY; IQ) AS A THRESHOLD VARIABLE AND REVISITS THE NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATURAL RESOURCE RENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH UNDER THE RESOURCE CURSE HYPOTHESIS. THE RESEARCH UTILIZES THE PANEL DATA OF 14 RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE THRESHOLD LEVEL(S) AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS USING CONVENTIONAL GIS STANDARD ERROR AND WHITE-CORRELATED STANDARD ERROR MODELS. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF TWO SIGNIFICANT THRESHOLD EFFECTS, INDICATING A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RESOURCE RENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH WHEN A COUNTRY'S IQ IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD LEVEL OF -1.28 AND WITHIN THE RANGE -1.28 TO -1.37. HOWEVER, BELOW THE THRESHOLD LEVEL OF -1.37, THE RESOURCE CURSE STARTS TO OPERATE, IMPEDING ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATION OF SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHODS OF MOMENT (GMM). THEREFORE, IN CONTRAST TO LINEAR AND EXOGENOUS THRESHOLD ESTIMATIONS, THIS PAPER SHOWS THE REQUIRED IQ THRESHOLD LEVELS FOR SSA RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES WHERE THEY CAN ENSURE ECONOMIC GROWTH USING THEIR NATURAL RESOURCE WINDFALLS. FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ENDOGENOUS NONLINEARITIES MAY CONCEAL BOTH THE REQUIRED MINIMUM THRESHOLD LEVELS OF COUNTRIES TO MAINTAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF IQ. THUS, WE RECOMMEND POLICYMAKERS AND RESEARCHERS CONSIDER THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF THE THRESHOLD EFFECTS OF IQ TO ALLOW FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH.
18	THE POLICE ARE THE INITIAL FACES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMENCE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AND THUS HOLD SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNCTIONING LAW AND ORDER. AS KEY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE, THE INTEGRITY OF THE POLICE IN ALL SOCIETIES IS PIVOTAL TO RETAIN PUBLIC TRUST IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRESERVATION OF INTERNAL SECURITY. WHEN POLICE CORRUPTION IS EXPOSED OR IS PERCEIVED BY THE PUBLIC TO BE PREVALENT, CONFIDENCE IN AND COMMUNAL RELATIONS WITH THE POLICE FORCE BECOME DISJOINTED. POOR CREDIBILITY OF THE POLICE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE GOVERNMENT. NEGATIVE PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF BOTH THE POLICE AND GOVERNMENT ARE PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME IN VIOLENTLY DIVIDED SOCIETIES OR STATES UNDERGOING ARMED CONFLICT. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE MAIN CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF POLICE CORRUPTION IN HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS TO INTRODUCE A RANGE OF PREVENTION STRATEGIES TO COMBAT IT AND RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN POLICING AND GOVERNANCE. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT A HOLISTIC ANTICORRUPTION STRATEGY, RATHER THAN A LINEAR ONE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RAISE AWARENESS, INCREASE PAY TO DETER PETTY FORMS OF CORRUPTION, INSTALL INDEPENDENT ANTICORRUPTION AGENCIES, AND PERIODICALLY ROTATE POLICE OFFICERS TO INCREASE POLICE INTEGRITY AND LOYALTY FOR THE HOST COUNTRY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THESE MULTIFACETED PREVENTION STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED WITHIN A POLICE FORCE THAT IS FACED WITH A VIOLENTLY DIVIDED SOCIETY TO REAFFIRM PUBLIC SUPPORT AND DETER SUPPORT FOR ARMED ANTI-GOVERNMENTAL OPPOSITIONAL GROUPS.
19	GUMERSINDO DE AZCARATE (LEDA, 1840- MADRID, 1917) WAS ONE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL LAW PROFESSOR AND POLITICIAN IN CONTEMPORARY SPAIN. HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SO-CALL KRAUSIST MOVEMENT THAT PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SPANISH CULTURE AND POLITICS AFTER THE REVOLUTION OF 1868. FROM BOTH, JOURNALS AND UNIVERSITY HE DEFENDED THE LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES THAT LEAD TO HIS IDEAL: A RULE OF LAW. IN THAT CONTEXT HE SUPPORTED THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF 1869, REGARDED BY AZCEIRATE FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE AS THE BEST ONE IN SPANISH MODERN HISTORY. WHEN THE RESTORATION TOOK PLACE IN 1874 AND A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY INSPIRED IN FRENCH DOCTINAIRES' POLITICAL THEORY WAS SET UP, AZCARATE CRITICISED IT PROPOSING TO LOOK OVER THE CONSTITUTION OF ENGLAND AS A MODEL. ACCORDING TO HIS INTERPRETATION OF ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT OR THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SOCIETY WAS THE KEY PRINCIPLE FOR BUILDING A TRUE DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE FREE ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUALS, A DECENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATION, AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL POWER AND PUBLIC OPINION AS THE VERY SOURCE, GUIDE AND LIMIT OF ALL THE POWERS OF THE STATE. FROM 1886 UP TO 1916 AZCEIRATE BECAME MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVE IN THE INTITUTE FOR SOCIAL REFORMS (1903) THAT TRIED TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES.
20	ON FEBRUARY 21, 2012, MEMBERS OF THE RUSSIAN PUNK BAND PUSSY RIOT STORMED THE HISTORIC CATHEDRAL OF CHRIST THE SAVIOR IN MOSCOW AND PERFORMED A "PUNK PRAYER" TO PROTEST THE POLICIES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN'S GOVERNMENT. THE BAND MEMBERS' SUBSEQUENT ARRESTS AND PROSECUTIONS SET OFF A GLOBAL FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM. WHILE SOME CRITICS FOCUSED ON THE DISPROPORTIONATE SENTENCES HANDED DOWN BY THE COURT FOLLOWING THE BAND'S CONVICTIONS, OR THE MEANING OF JUSTICE METED OUT BY AN UNJUST REGIME, THE MAINSTREAM REACTION WAS BY AND LARGE ONE OF DISBELIEF AT SUCH AN APPARENTLY EGREGIOUS CRACKDOWN ON FREE SPEECH. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT SUCH CRITICISM LARGELY MISSED THE MARK BY CASTING THE PUSSY RIOT AFFAIR IN TERMS OF FREE SPEECH, DESPITE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PUNK ROCKERS WOULD HAVE FACED A SIMILAR FATE EVEN UNDER AMERICAN FREE SPEECH LAW-A TRADITION OF PROTECTED SPEECH MORE ROBUST THAN ANY OTHER. INSTEAD, CRITICISM OF THE INJUSTICE PERPETRATED BY THE PROSECUTIONS IS BETTER AIMED AT THE INADEQUATE PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS OF A RUSSIAN JUDICIARY IN DESPERATE NEED OF REFORM. AS RUSSIANS ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN THEIR JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THEY WOULD LIKELY BE MUCH MORE AMENABLE TO INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE PUSSY RIOT PROSECUTIONS DID NOT TRAMPLE ON FREE SPEECH RIGHTS BUT WERE NONETHELESS UNJUST DUE TO THE LACK OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS ACCORDED TO THE BAND MEMBERS. SUCH AN APPROACH, BY MORE ACCURATELY CRITICIZING THE REAL ISSUES RUSSIA'S FLEDGLING DEMOCRACY FACES, PROMISES TO FURTHER RUSSIA'S DEVELOPMENT BY KEEPING LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN ELECTORATE AND THE WEST.
21	THIS ARTICLE EXPANDS UPON THE IDEA THAT REPEAT PLAYERS INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW BY SETTLING CASES THEY ARE LIKELY TO LOSE AND LITIGATING CASES THEY ARE LIKELY TO WIN. THROUGH EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL OPINIONS INTERPRETING THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, IT SHOWS HOW THE RULE-MAKING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LITIGATION PROCESS AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND THE JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF STATUTORY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW EARLY JUDICIAL OPINIONS MIGHT INFLUENCE LATER JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW. ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS MAY SUCCESSFULLY MOBILIZE THE LAW TO GAIN BENEFITS IN THEIR DISPUTES, THAT SUCCESS OFTEN REMOVES THEIR EXPERIENCES FROM THE JUDICIAL DETERMINATION OF RIGHTS, LIMITING LAW'S CAPACITY TO PRODUCE SOCIAL CHANGE. THIS PARADOX OF LOSING BY WINNING SEPARATES THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION FUNCTION OF COURTS FROM THEIR LAW-MAKING FUNCTION AND RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW.
22	THIS PAPER IS PROVOKED BY ROSALIND DIXON'S BOOK ON RESPONSIBLE JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THE ARGUMENTS EXPRESSED BY THE AUTHOR. THE PAPER DEALS WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN SERBIA, AS THE MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FOR A RESPONSIVE JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE MAIN PREMISE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES, ALMOST UNKNOWN IN PROFESSIONAL CIRCLES, AND THEIR SERVILE RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ACTS AS A GUARDIAN OF CONTROVERSIAL EXECUTIVE POLICIES. THE AUTHOR BRIEFLY DESCRIBES THE ORIGINS OF THE SERBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE LEVEL OF ITS INDEPENDENCE. SOME RELEVANT CASES ARE PRESENTED THAT DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL STRATEGIES APPLIED BY JUDGES WHICH SUPPORT THE THESIS THAT JUDGES ALLOW POLITICAL AND OTHER FACTORS TO INFLUENCE THEIR DECISIONS. THE AUTHOR ALSO PRESENTS HUMAN RIGHTS CASES THAT ILLUSTRATE A VERY FORMALISTIC APPROACH OF THE COURT THAT INFLUENCES ITS OWN LEGITIMACY AND LACK OF SUPPORT.
23	KOSOVO IS ONE OF SEVERAL WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THE NEXT ROUND OF ACCESSION TO THE EU. LIKE BOSNIA, SERBIA, AND CROATIA, IT IS ALSO A COUNTRY IN WHICH THE HISTORY OF CONFLICT IS RECENT AND THE BENEFITS OF EU MEMBERSHIP OUGHT TO BE A STRONG ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENTICEMENT TO MEET THE STANDARDS NECESSARY FOR MEMBERSHIP. YET, INSTEAD OF MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OF THE POST-CONFLICT SOCIETY TOWARDS DEMOCRATIZATION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND A ROBUST HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME, THE PROSPECT OF EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERSHIP APPEARS TO BE LEADING TO SUPERFICIAL LEGAL CHANGES WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE TENSIONS BETWEEN INTERNAL CHALLENGES TO LEGAL CHANGE AND EXTERNAL PRESSURES FOR REFORM, ADDING TO THE LITERATURE ON THE DECOUPLING OF EUROPEANIZATION AND DOMESTIC CHANGE IN CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. A SHORT ANALYSIS OF ONE POLICY AREA, WOMEN'S PROPERTY RIGHTS, ILLUMINATES THE GAPS BETWEEN LEGAL CHANGE AND ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS HOW AND WHEN A CHANGE IN LAW CAN LEAD TO SOCIAL CHANGE. IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT LEGAL CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EU CONDITIONALITIES MAY BEGIN SUPERFICIALLY, BUT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT CAN EVENTUALLY LEAD TO DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND A MORE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT OF LAW.
24	THE POWER OF THE STATE TO EXCLUDE CRIMINALS FROM PARLIAMENT IS LIMITED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND EUROPEAN GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHT TO PASSIVE SUFFRAGE. THE MAIN POINTS OF FRICTION BETWEEN THE RESTRICTIONS ESTABLISHED IN THE SPANISH LEGAL SYSTEM WILL BE IDENTIFIED, CONSIDERING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE EURO-PEAN CONSTITUTIONAL HERITAGE. THE CASE LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL THEN BE EXAMINED TO ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES POSED BY THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF TRANSCENDENTAL AREAS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS.
25	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT SPARKED BY DJOKOVIC'S ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA, UNVACCINATED, TO CONSIDER THE FORMS OF CITIZENSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE RISE OF NATION BRANDING AND ITS ATTENDANT FORMS OF COMMERCIAL NATIONALISM. THE COMBINATION OF COMMERCIAL AND NATIONAL IDENTITY HIGHLIGHTS THE CONVERGENCE OF THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMERCIAL NATIONALISM. THIS IS A CONTEXT IN WHICH CONSUMER SOVEREIGNTY RECONFIGURES AND DISPLACES CIVIC COMMITMENTS. TO EXPLORE THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS VERSION OF CITIZENSHIP AND THE TENSION BETWEEN ITS EXISTENCE AND ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS, WE INTERVIEWED 12 SERBIAN AUSTRALIANS SHORTLY AFTER THE DJOKOVIC INCIDENT (MARCH-MAY 2022) AND CONDUCTED A MEDIA TEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF SERBIAN AND AUSTRALIAN MEDIA. WE ARGUE THAT DJOKOVIC BECAME AN AVATAR FOR THE ELEVATION OF A CONSUMERIST VERSION OF CITIZENSHIP IN WHICH THE SOCIAL CONTRACT FEATURED AS A FORM OF OPPRESSION FROM WHICH CONSUMERS-AS-KING CAN EXEMPT THEMSELVES.
26	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRATEGIC RHETORIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATION. IT FIRST TRIES TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SOPHISTICAL MANIPULATION AND VALID STRATEGIC ARGUMENTATION. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, THE AUTHOR TRIES TO GIVE A NEW MEANING TO THE OLD ARISTOTELIAN TRIPARTITION BETWEEN LOGOS, ETHOS, AND PATHOS. THEN, HE USES CHAIM PERELMAN'S THEORY OF ARGUMENTATION TO SHOW THAT THE STANDARD OF RATIONALITY IN PRACTICAL REASONING IS A SPECIFIC ONE. AFTER HAVING CLARIFIED THE VERY CONCEPT OF STRATEGIC ARGUMENTATION, THE AUTHOR DISTINGUISHES IT FROM THE NOTION OF PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATION. HE TRIES TO SHOW THAT IF THE LATTER IS COMPLETELY REPLACED BY THE FORMER, THE DANGER EXISTS THAT VICTIMIZATION AND MORALS "A LA CARTE" WILL GENERATE A DEFEAT OF CRITICAL THOUGHT.
27	A HISTORICAL RETELLING OF EUROPEAN COMPETITION POLICY IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE RULES IN THE TREATIES AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THE HISTORIAN MUST NAVIGATE TREACHEROUS WATERS BETWEEN CONTRASTING TREATY STIPULATIONS IN THE ECSC AND IN THE EEC TREATIES, INITIAL ATTEMPTS AT RIGOROUS IMPLEMENTATION BUT WITH LIMITED EFFECT ON THE GROUND, AND A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ONLY IN THE 1980S DID THE COMMISSION ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THE ECJ'S SUPPORTIVE CASE LAW. THESE BENEFITS CAME DUE TO A FORTUNATE CONJUNCTURE OF POLITICAL, ECONOMICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FACTORS.
28	IN MARCH 1910, AFTER TWO YEARS OF SUSTAINED SURVEILLANCE BY THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT, A YOUNG INDIAN REVOLUTIONARY NATIONALIST, VINAYAK DAMODAR SAVARKAR (1883-1966), WAS ARRESTED IN LONDON AND EXTRADITED TO INDIA FOR TRIAL. AMONG THE CHARGES HE FACED WAS THE CURIOUS ONE OF SEDITION. USING SAVARKAR AS THE STARTING POINT - AND CONCLUDING WITH GANDHI'S OWN ENCOUNTER WITH SEDITION - THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT SEDITION LAW HAD A CRITICAL, AND EXTENDED, LIFE IN THE COLONIAL CONTEXT, ALLOWING THE USE OF WHAT WERE SEEN AS DANGEROUS WORDS TO BE EVIDENCE OF CONSPIRACY LONG AFTER THE METROPOLE HAD ABANDONED THE PRACTICE. THE COLONIAL STATE'S RESPONSE TO REVOLUTIONARY NATIONALISM GAVE RISE TO TWO PRINCIPAL COLONIAL WEAPONS AGAINST ANTI-COLONIAL NATIONALISM (WHETHER MANIFESTED IN SAVARKAR'S CALL FOR ARMED REBELLION OR GANDHIAN NONVIOLENT NONCOOPERATION). THE FIRST WEAPON WAS SURVEILLANCE, A DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY OF STATE CONTROL THAT PLACED AN INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG 'REVOLUTIONARIES' UNDER SYSTEMATIC MONITORING. THEY WERE PLACED UNDER SURVEILLANCE TO MONITOR NOT JUST WHAT THEY WERE DOING, BUT ALSO WHAT THEY WERE THINKING, WRITING, AND SPEAKING. THE SECOND AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT WEAPON OF THE COLONIAL STATE IN INDIA WAS SEDITION LAW. WHILE SEDITION HAD A LONG HISTORY IN BRITAIN, THE MODERN HISTORY OF SEDITION WAS IN FACT INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO COLONIAL RULE. THE HISTORY OF COLONIAL SURVEILLANCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEDITION LAW STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE REAL DANGER POSED BY ALL NATIONALISTS, REVOLUTIONARY AND OTHERWISE, LAY IN A VIOLENCE THAT WAS FAR MORE RHETORICAL AND SYMBOLIC THAN PHYSICAL, FOR WHAT WAS REALLY AT STAKE WAS THE FUNDAMENTAL LEGITIMACY OF COLONIAL RULE.
29	THE TERM "GOOD GOVERNANCE" IS UNSETTLED IN ITS MEANING. THROUGH THE 1980S AND 1990S, DONOR COUNTRIES AND INSTITUTIONS TRENDED TO MAKE AID CONDITIONAL UPON REFORMS IN THE RECIPIENT COUNTRY, WHICH WAS FOUND LARGELY INEFFECTIVE IN ENCOURAGING REAL POLICY CHANGES. MORE RECENTLY, DONORS, SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE UNITED STATES, ARE INCREASINGLY INSISTING UPON PERFORMANCE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AS A PREREQUISITE FOR AID, A PRACTICE CALLED "SELECTIVITY". THIS IS A MEANS OF REQUIRING A RECIPIENT STATE TO DEMONSTRATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF ITS COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REFORMS. THERE ARE NO OBJECTIVE STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING GOOD GOVERNANCE: SOME ASPECTS INCLUDE POLITICAL STABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY AND WEAK GOVERNANCE ARE LINKED, MAKING SELECTIVITY DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. FOR REFORMS TO SUCCEED, DOMESTIC SUPPORT, OWNERSHIP, AND COMMITMENT ARE CRUCIAL, AS ARE THE RECIPIENT'S CULTURAL CONTEXT AND HISTORY.
30	EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW DEMONSTRATES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AND COSMOPOLITAN CONCEPTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION CAN PROTECT CONSUMER WELFARE AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN "WESTPHALIAN CONCEPTIONS" OF "INTERNATIONAL LAW AMONG SOVEREIGN STATES". THE OBVIOUS "GOVERNANCE FAILURES" TO CONCLUDE THE DOHA ROUND NEGOTIATIONS AND PREVENT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE 2008, CLIMATE CHANGE AND UNNECESSARY POVERTY ARE DUE TO MULTILEVEL "REGULATORY FAILURES", INCLUDING LACK OF LEADERSHIP BY THE G20 COUNTRIES FOR PROTECTING THE "GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS" OF AN EFFICIENT WORLD TRADING, FINANCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW SYSTEM. MERCANTILIST CONCEPTIONS OF "MEMBER-DRIVEN GOVERNANCE" AND OF INADEQUATE "RECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS" NEGLECT THE "HORIZONTAL" AS WELL AS "VERTICAL" INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS AND THE NEED FOR THEIR DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT AND LEGITIMIZATION BY CITIZENS AND PARLIAMENTS. THE "SYSTEMIC FAILURES" OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL POWER POLITICS BASED ON "LEGAL NATIONALISM" ARE DISCUSSED BY USING THE ANALYTICAL TOOLS OF "PUBLIC GOODS THEORY" AND "CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY" FOCUSING ON FIVE "COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEMS" ITNPEDING EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF INTERDEPENDENT, CITIZEN-DRIVEN "PUBLIC GOODS". THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS OF THE PAPER IS THAT EFFICIENT AND LEGITIMATE, MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE OF INTERDEPENDENT TRADING, ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS REQUIRES STRONGER "STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION" AND PROTECTION OF TRANSNATIONAL "RULE OF LAW" FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS AS A CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRAINT ON THE "RULE BY MEN", THEIR "RULE BY LAW" AND THE "UBIQUITY" OF SELFISH ABUSES OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REGULATORY POWERS.
31	THE IMPETUS FOR WRITING THIS ARTICLE CAME FROM THE NOTION OF MUHAMMAD HAMIDULLAH, A RENOWNED TWENTIETH-CENTURY ISLAMIC SCHOLAR. HE HAS DESCRIBED THE MADINAH CHARTER AS THE WORLD'S FIRST WRITTEN CONSTITUTION. AS THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONS CONTAIN CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES EMBEDDED WITHIN THEM, SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH INCLUDES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE, SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE OBJECTIVES AND FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE MADINAH CHARTER. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY ADOPTED IN THIS ARTICLE IS A DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS BY REFERRING TO THE MADINAH CHARTER AS DISCUSSED IN THE BOOK BY HAMIDULLAH, THE PROPHET'S ESTABLISHING A STATE AND HIS SUCCESSION. FROM THE OBJECTIVES AND FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE MADINAH CHARTER, THE ARTICLE EXTRACTS SOME SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE OBJECTIVES AND FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES EMBEDDED IN A MODERN CONSTITUTION. THIS BRINGS OUT THE ARGUMENT OF WHETHER THE MADINAH CHARTER CAN BE RECOGNISED AS THE WORLD'S FIRST WRITTEN CONSTITUTION DESPITE NOT BEING CATEGORISED AS A MODERN CONSTITUTION.
32	ENSURING NATIONAL SECURITY IS THE KEY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE AND ITS RECOGNITION IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA. THE MOST ACUTE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FIELD OF ENSURING NATIONAL SECURITY UNDER MARTIAL LAW ARE STUDIED AND DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE INDICATED SOCIALLY IMPORTANT SPHERE IS ALSO MADE, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH CERTAIN STEPS ARE PROPOSED REGARDING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE PROTECTION OF KEY NATIONAL SECURITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS, EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND NECESSITY OF PROPER OBSERVANCE OF THE RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF CITIZENS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION EVEN DURING MARTIAL LAW OR ANY OTHER CRISIS OR EMERGENCY SITUATION. THE AUTHORS HIGHLIGHTED THE KEY ELEMENTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE REAL RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE, WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE SHOULD BE NO COMPROMISE, AND WHICH, ACCORDINGLY, SHOULD BE RELIABLY PRESERVED BY THE STATE IN THE FORM OF ITS COMPETENT AGENCIES.
33	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF LEGAL PROBLEMS OF CIRCULATION OF VIRTUAL ASSETS IN CHARITABLE AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE FORMATION OF PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THEM. THE PRACTICE OF THE USE OF VIRTUAL ASSETS BY THE NATIONAL BANK OF UKRAINE, PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS BUSINESS ENTITIES AND NON-BUSINESS ENTITIES, IS HIGHLIGHTED. IT WAS SUBSTANTIATED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF AN APPROPRIATE SYSTEM OF LEGAL REGULATION, SUCH PRACTICE LEADS TO A VIOLATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF ITS CONSTRUCTION, AMONG WHICH THE LEADING ROLE PLAYED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF "GREY ZONES" IN A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE VIRTUAL ASSET'S CIRCULATION SPHERE, IS AN UNACCEPTABLE PHENOMENON FOR THE RULE OF LAW. ITS OVERCOMING IS THE MAIN TASK OF LAW AS A SOCIAL REGULATOR AND THE STATE AS THE GUARANTOR OF THE RIGHT OF ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. IT IS NOTED THAT THE LAG IN THE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE CIRCULATION OF VIRTUAL ASSETS IS OBVIOUS, WHICH IS DUE TO THE DELAY OF ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE KEY TO THIS AREA OF RELATIONS LAW OF UKRAINE "ON VIRTUAL ASSETS". CONSEQUENTLY, FOR THE PERIOD UNTIL THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THIS LAW, IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO USE THE METHOD OF AN ANALOGY OF THE LAW TO EXTEND TO VIRTUAL ASSETS (CORRESPONDING TO THE FEATURES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OR CURRENCY VALUES) THE LEGAL REGIME OF THESE INSTRUMENTS OR VALUES, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE POSITIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, LAW-MAKING OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND JUDICIAL PRACTICE. BASED ON THE PRACTICE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES, IT IS NOTED THAT RECEIPT BY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS OF VIRTUAL ASSETS AS A DONATION OR CREDITING OF FUNDS FROM THEIR SALE OR EXCHANGE TO THE ACCOUNT OF A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, CREATES CERTAIN RISKS BOTH FOR SUCH ORGANIZATION AND FOR THE BENEFACTORS. ACCORDINGLY, IN ORDER TO PREVENT CASES OF CREDITING CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS' ACCOUNTS WITH VIRTUAL ASSETS OBTAINED BY CRIMINAL MEANS, IT IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A REGULATORY OBLIGATION OF SUBJECTS OF PRIMARY MONITORING TO IDENTIFY AND VERIFY EXACTLY THE PERSON WHO MAKES THE DONATION (PRIMARY BENEFACTOR) OR PAYMENT FOR GOODS/SERVICES (PRIMARY PAYER) (EXPERIENCE OF THE USA AND GREAT BRITAIN).
34	THE DIFFERENCE OF JUDICIAL OPINION IN THE SUPREME COURT IN EVANS PROVOKES REFLECTION ON FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. A STATUTE THAT ON ITS FACE SEEMS TO PERMIT A GOVERNMENT MINISTER TO OVERRIDE A JUDICIAL DECISION OF WHICH HE DISAPPROVES INEVITABLY RAISES ACUTE CONCERN; THE CORRECT READING OF THE STATUTE DEPENDS ON THE MOST PERSUASIVE INTEGRATION OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, PLACING THE TEXT WITHIN ITS WIDER CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. THE JUSTICES DEPLOYED DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN LAW, FACT, AND PUBLIC INTEREST IN RATHER DIFFERENT WAYS, REFLECTING THEIR DIVERGENT INTERPRETATIVE APPROACHES. THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IS ALSO OF PARTICULAR INTEREST - CENTRAL TO THE LEGAL ISSUES ARISING, ON ONE VIEW, BUT LARGELY IRRELEVANT ON ANOTHER. AT THE ROOT OF THESE DISAGREEMENTS LIE CONTRASTING CONCEPTIONS OF LAW AND ADJUDICATION.
35	HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BEEN A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN US-CHINA RELATIONS FROM THEIR VERY BEGINNING. IN THE EARLY YEARS THE ISSUE WAS ONE-WAY, WITH WASHINGTON CONSTANTLY CRITICIZING POLITICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL INEQUITIES IN MAOS CHINA. CHINA HAS FOUGHT BACK, POINTING TO DEFICIENCIES IN THE US SYSTEM WHILE PROCEEDING IN RECENT YEARS TO IMPLEMENT A LARGE-SCALE PROGRAM OF DETENTION AND INCARCERATION TARGETING MUSLIM MINORITIES IN XINJIANG. NEITHER THE UNITED STATES NOR ANY OTHER COUNTRY OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION CAN COMPEL ADHERENCE TO HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS IN CHINA. BUT SETTING AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH ADHERENCE DOES GET NOTICED, AND IF A PRESIDENT BIDEN ALIGNS WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER, RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW, REFUSES TO ENDORSE DICTATORS, AND URGES THE US SENATE TO APPROVE AND RATIFY ALL THE UN CONVENTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS, HE MIGHT BE MORE PERSUASIVE IN URGING BEIJING TO CHANGE ITS DIRECTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. BUT THIS IS ONLY CONCEIVABLE IF PURSUED IN THE CONTEXT OF A NEW US POLICY OF COMPETITIVE COEXISTENCE WITH CHINA, AND NOT STRATEGIC CONFRONTATION.
36	WHILE EXISTING RESEARCH ON TERRORIST GROUP TERMINATION EXAMINES NUMEROUS FACTORS EXPLAINING WHY SOME TERROR GROUPS END THEIR CAMPAIGNS OF VIOLENCE, THESE STUDIES DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE IMPACT THAT THE ACTORS WHO ACTIVELY FIGHT THESE GROUPS HAVE ON THE PROBABILITY OF A GROUP'S DEMISE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF GENDARMERIES ON TERRORIST GROUP TERMINATION. GENDARMERIES MAY EITHER CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO THE COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS OF THE STATE WITH THEIR POLICING AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, OR THEY MAY UNDERMINE THESE EFFORTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY BECOME UNACCOUNTABLE TO THE STATE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. LAX ACCOUNTABILITY MAY LEAD TO PRINCIPLE-AGENT PROBLEMS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE RISK OF THOSE GROUPS ENGAGING IN REPRESSIVE OR RENT-SEEKING ACTIONS, WHICH CAN UNDERMINE SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE TERROR GROUP. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COMPETING WAYS IN WHICH GENDARMERIES CAN AFFECT COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ARE CONDITIONED BY THE BUREAUCRATIC EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE IN MANAGING THE ACTIVITIES OF GENDARMERIE FORCES AND BY THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS OF EMPIRICAL ANALYSES REVEAL THAT HAVING GENDARMERIES INCREASES A TERRORIST GROUP'S CHANCE OF ENDING THEIR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE BUT DECREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF A GROUP'S DEMISE IN STATES MARKED BY LOWER BUREAUCRATIC EFFECTIVENESS AND WEAK RULE OF LAW.
37	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND OF COVID-19 RELATED MEASURES INTRODUCED DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE VISEGRAD GROUP. THESE COUNTRIES INTRODUCED MEASURES WITHIN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT MAY BE VIOLATION AGAINST THE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A MIXED APPROACH METHODOLOGY IS USED. FIRSTLY, THE EXAMINED COUNTRIES ARE ANALYSED AND COMPARED FROM THE ASPECT OF CONSTRUCTIONAL LAW AND POLITICAL SCIENCE IN THE FORM OF CASE STUDIES. THEN, EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS LIMITED TO TWITTER CONTENTS. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT, HOWEVER, IN EVERY ANALYSED COUNTRY, THE MEASURES CHALLENGE THE EUROPEAN VALUES THESE ARE NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA EQUALLY. WHILE SLOVAKIA IS DISPLAYED FROM A COOPERATIVE ASPECT, THE CZECH REPUBLIC HAS A FEW CRITICS. POLAND AND HUNGARY HAVE A BIASED, NEGATIVE REPUTATION FILLED WITH HEAVY CRITICS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE LIMITATION OF THIS PAPER LIES IN THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, AS SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BASED ON KEYWORD SEARCH AND WITHIN A DEFINED TIME SCOPE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - FINDINGS HELP DECISION-MAKERS CONCENTRATE ON AND MODIFY THEIR COMMUNICATION CONCERNING THE EXTRAORDINARY REGULATIONS DURING A WORLDWIDE CRISIS, SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FEEDBACK OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ANALYSED IS VALUABLE FOR POLITICIANS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS WELL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE SOCIO-POLITICAL IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAVE NOT BEEN ELABORATED IN THE LITERATURE YET WITH RESPECT TO THE V4 COUNTRIES. THE V4-COUNTRIES ARE A SPECIAL ENTITY AS AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL PLATFORM WITHIN THE EU, WHOSE REPUTATION AS DEMOCRACIES IS RATHER HETEROGENEOUS.
38	WHETHER DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE BREEDS CORRUPTION, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT PRACTICE DEMOCRACY, IS HIGHLY DEBATABLE. USING PRIMARY DATA FROM INTERVIEWS AND RELEVANT SECONDARY DATA FROM MEDIA REPORTS AND SCHOLARLY WORK, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ADDRESS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION: DOES DEMOCRACY FUEL CORRUPTION IN GHANA'S FOURTH REPUBLIC? ALTHOUGH 20% OF PARTICIPANTS BELIEVED THAT DEMOCRACY BREEDS CORRUPTION, ABOUT 80% DISAGREED. THE STUDY INDICATES THAT DEMOCRACY DOES NOT NECESSARILY BRING ABOUT CORRUPTION; RATHER, WHAT FUELS CORRUPTION IS HOW DEMOCRACY IS PRACTICED. BASED ON THE STAGE/AGE OF DEMOCRACY THESIS, THIS STUDY DOES NOT SUGGEST LESS CORRUPTION IN A DICTATORSHIP COMPARED TO DEMOCRACY. INSTEAD, THE STUDY INDICATES THAT DESPITE ITS DEMOCRACY BEING OVER 29 YEARS OLD, CORRUPTION IS STILL PREVALENT BECAUSE GHANA HAS A FLAWED DEMOCRACY THAT HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT ROBUST ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS TO CONTROL CORRUPTION EFFECTIVELY. THE THEORETICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATION IS TO AVOID A LENGTHY PERIOD OF THE FLAWED/ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY PHASE AND MOVE TO THE MATURE DEMOCRACY PHASE BY, FOR EXAMPLE, ENSURING A SUSTAINED POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO COMBATTING CORRUPTION AND STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE JUDICIARY. THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND CORRUPTION.
39	TODAY, THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT CASES OF EXCESSIVE USE OF POLICE FORCE HAVE BECOME A SERIOUS SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM THAT IS URGENT TO ADDRESS. FOR THIS REASON, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ACCURACY OF THEIR FRAME OF REFERENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN ORDER TO VISUALIZE DIFFERENT VIABLE OPTIONS FOR REGULATION AND TREATMENT IN THE MEXICAN CONTEXT.
40	AS ERIC BLAIR, THE YOUNG GEORGE ORWELL SERVED IN THE INDIAN IMPERIAL POLICE IN BURMA FROM 1922 TO 1929, A TIME OF GROWING BURMESE DISCONTENT WITH BRITISH RULE. HE WROTE ABOUT BURMA IN A NOVEL, BURMESE DAYS, AND A NUMBER OF NON-FICTIONAL WRITINGS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF THE LAW-AND-ORDER REGIME ORWELL SERVED IN BURMA, ESPECIALLY IN THE LIGHT OF RACIAL SELF-INTEREST AND BRITAIN'S COMMITMENT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND TRACES THE ISSUES OF RACE AND THE LAW TO HIS LAST NOVEL, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR.
41	THE "ESTABLISHED BY LAW" CRITERION RECENTLY EMERGED AS AN INDEPENDENT ELEMENT OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR), THROUGH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS' (ECTHR'S) JUDGMENT IN ASTRAOSSON V. ICELAND. THE CRITERION IMPOSES THE OBLIGATION ON STATES TO APPOINT JUDGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. ITS EMERGENCE OCCURRED AT A PRECARIOUS MOMENT IN EUROPEAN INTERGOVERNMENTAL POLITICS, WITH ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN STATES EXHIBITING TACTICS AIMED AT SOFTENING OBSTACLES TO THEIR GOVERNING POWERS, UPHELD BY THEIR RESPECTIVE JUDICIARIES. THROUGH A DIALOG BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION (EFTA) COURT, THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU), AND THE ECTHR, THE "ESTABLISHED BY LAW" CRITERION HAS NOW EMERGED IN THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY FOR THWARTING SUCH TACTICS. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE STORY OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IS TOLD THROUGH HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN SUPRANATIONAL COURTS AND THROUGH THE ICELANDIC BACKSTORY OF THE ASTRAOSSON CASE. THIS STORY REVEALS IMPORTANT NUANCES IN HOW THE CASE LAW NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WITH REGARDS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL FORCES AT STAKE. THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH OF THE ECTHR IN ASTRAOSSON IS ALSO ANALYZED IN CONTEXT WITH LON FULLER'S RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE OF CONGRUENCE, WHICH PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE MERITS OF THE COURT'S TACTIC.
42	NEVER BEFORE HAS IT BEEN MORE CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE PROSPECT OF NATURAL DISASTERS THAT AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD EVERY YEAR. EFFICIENT MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN DOMESTIC DISASTER RELIEF (MI/DDR) IS SUPPOSED TO FACILITATE DISASTER RESPONSE OPERATIONS. THIS PAPER, BASED ON A CASE STUDY OF CHINESE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY'S ENGAGEMENT IN DDR, AIMS TO THEORIZE THE KEY LEGAL VARIABLES OF MI/DDR AND OFFER AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR IT. THIS PAPER THEORIZES FIVE KEY LEGAL DYNAMICS: LEGITIMACY, DOMAIN, COMMAND, SUPPORT, AND COST. IT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT MI/DDR IS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, A FUNCTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SHOULD BE ONE OF THE VISIBLE WAYS THROUGH WHICH A GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATES THE RULE OF LAW. THE INSUFFICIENCY OF CHINESE MI/DDR WITHIN THE CURRENT LEGAL UNDERPINNING ILLUSTRATES THE NEED TO RECONSIDER THE RE- STRUCTURING AND APPLICATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LEGAL DYNAMICS. THIS STUDY PROPOSES THAT COMPARATIVE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS ISSUE.
43	THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO PRESENT A CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS OF PRO-POOR GROWTH IN 80 COUNTRIES IN 237 GROWTH SPELLS DURING THE PERIOD 1984-2001. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE THE PAPER PROPOSES A NEW MEASURE OF PRO-POOR GROWTH THAT CAPTURES GAINS AND LOSSES OF GROWTH RATES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSUMPTION. THE GAINS IMPLY PRO-POOR GROWTH, WHILE THE LOSSES IMPLY ANTI-POOR GROWTH. THE STATISTICAL TEST CARRIED OUT IN THE PAPER SHOWS THAT REGIONAL LOCATION OF COUNTRIES HAS A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH THE PRO-POORNESS OF GROWTH. THE PAPER ALSO ATTEMPTS TO TEST FOR THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GROWTH PATTERNS AND CERTAIN VARIABLES THAT THE LITERATURE HAS IDENTIFIED AS SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS OF GROWTH AND INEQUALITY. OUT OF MANY VARIABLES, THE PAPER FOCUSES ON FOUR, NAMELY, INFLATION, THE SHARE OF AGRICULTURE IN GDP, OPENNESS TO TRADE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
44	THE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A CALAMITY. INCOMPETENT LEADERS HAVE TURNED A NATURAL DISASTER INTO A NATIONAL CATASTROPHE. THE CATASTROPHE UNMASKS A WEAK RULE OF LAW THAT IS CLOSER TO A REIGN OF MEN THAN IT IS TO A GOVERNMENT OF LAWS. LOUSY LEGAL METHODS PREDATING COVID-19 ALLOWED TRAGEDY TO HAPPEN. THIS ARTICLE SUMMARISES THE LEGISLATIVE-LIKE RESPONSES TO COVID-19 AND IDENTIFIES SYSTEMIC FAILURES, I.E. COVID-19 PREEXISTING VULNERABILITIES.
45	THE STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS THAT ARE FOUND IN LAWMAKING PROCESS IN ROMANIA. IT WILL BE STRUCTURED IN FOUR SECTIONS, IN WHICH WILL BE ADDRESSED, IN SUCCESSION, THE REQUIREMENTS DRAWN FROM CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATIONS IN MATTERS OF LAWMAKING PROCESS IN ROMANIA, THEN THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES DRAWN FROM THE LEGISLATION OF RULES REGARDING THE LEGISLATIVE TECHNIQUE. FURTHER, REPORTING TO THE IDEAS EXPRESSED IN THE FIRST TWO SECTIONS, THERE WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED THE WORST SHORTCOMINGS, BY THE CONTENT AND CONSEQUENCES, AND IN THE LAST PART OF THE STUDY WILL BE REVEALED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THEY PRODUCE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND, IMPLICITLY, ON BUSINESSES ENVIRONMENT. ALSO, THERE WILL BE OUTLINED SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE.
46	IN COMBATING TERRORISM, DEMOCRACIES CANNOT OVERSTEP THE LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND BY THE TAUTOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH CONVERGES WITH THE FIRST ONE. THIS IS NOT COUNTERACTED BY THE REPROACH OF BEING A SELF-ASSERTIVE DEMOCRACY, REGARDED AS A NEGATIVE CONCEPT BY THE MAJORITY OF THE SPANISH LITERATURE. DEMOCRACY IS NOT AN ETHICALLY NEUTRAL REGIME. DEMOCRACY MUST BE AS STRONG AS REQUIRED TO PROTECT ITS OWN VALUES.
47	HIGHLIGHTING LEGAL-GOVERNMENTAL TECHNIQUES BY WHICH THE PUBLIC IS CONCEPTUALISED AS THE MARKET AND MARKET ACTIVITY AS PUBLIC AGENCY, THIS ARTICLE POSES INDIA AS A KEY SITE FOR A GLOBALISED ANALYSIS OF NEO-LIBERAL GOVERNANCE. IT OPENS A GENEALOGY FOR INDIA'S EMERGING MARKET' GOVERNANCE THAT EXTENDS BACK TO COLONIAL MODERNISATION, HIGHLIGHTING TIES BETWEEN A COERCIVE STATE, ITS BENEVOLENT PERFORMANCE AND THE MAKING OF A MARKET SOCIETY. SUCH A LONG VIEW CHALLENGES THE FREE MARKET VS. STRONG STATE OPPOSITION SO CENTRAL TO CONTEMPORARY NEO-LIBERAL THOUGHT. IT ALSO CALLS ATTENTION TO THE NEXUS BETWEEN POWERS OF EMERGENCY AND EMERGING MARKETS. ELABORATING, THE ESSAY ENGAGES FOUCAULT'S ANALYSIS OF NEO-LIBERAL POLITICAL ECONOMY TO READ RECENT INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE ON FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PUBLIC INTEREST.
48	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BY ECONOMIC COURTS OF UKRAINE AND THEIR LEGAL NATURE IS DISCLOSED. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS OF "JURISDICTION" AND "JUSTICE" IS DETERMINED; THE AUTHOR FORMULATES THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OUTLINES ITS MAIN ELEMENTS; THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND ITS VARIANTS IS DISCLOSED; CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE REASONABLENESS OF THE TERMS OF THE COURT'S CONSIDERATION OF THE CASE ARE PROPOSED; IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE JUDGMENT IS THE FINAL STAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND ONE OF THE MAIN CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR HAS PROVED THAT THE CURRENT ECONOMIC PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE IS BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVITY OF JUDICIAL BODIES AND WAYS OF ITS IMPROVEMENT ARE SUGGESTED.
49	THIS DOCUMENT PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT, RESULTS AND SCOPE OF A DOCTORAL THESIS INVESTIGATION WHOSE GENERAL OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP OF TEACHING MANAGERS IN THE PROCESSES OF THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE OFFERED BY THE LUIGI PIRANDELLO SCHOOL (BOGOTA DC) AND THE CAMPESTRE REINO BRITANICO GYMNASIUM (TENJO), LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CUNDINAMARCA, COLOMBIA. FROM A CAUSAL CORRELATIONAL INVESTIGATION, WITH A MIXED APPROACH AND A NON-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MANAGERIAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, PEDAGOGICAL AND COMMUNITY PROCESSES WAS ANALYZED, REGARDING THE LEADERSHIP FUNCTION OF TEACHING MANAGERS. THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS ANALYZED FROM A BROAD CONCEPTION WHERE EDUCATION IS, ABOVE ALL, A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, AND AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE.
50	THIS ESSAY REFLECTS ON SOCIAL POLICY AS A PARADIGM ON WHICH RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC THEORY RESTS; CONSEQUENTLY, IT DESCRIBES THE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE POLICY MODELS OF THE 'SOCIAL RIGHTS BASED STATE' AND THE 'SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY' AS THEY IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC POLICY WHICH, AT PRESENT, TO BE SUCCESSFUL, REQUIRES FIRM AND CONCERTED ACTION BY THE STATE AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE HIGHLIGHT THE PARTICULAR VALUE THAT PUBLIC-PUBLIC AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE ALLIANCES (APP)-HAVE IN ACHIEVING THE PURPOSES OF 'SOCIAL RULE OF LAW' IN COLOMBIA. FINALLY, WE EMPHASIZE THE USEFULNESS OF APPS IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND DISCUSS RELEVANT EXPERIENCES CARRIED OUT BOTH BY INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AGENCIES AND BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN BOGOTA.
51	BACKGROUNDONE HEALTH APPROACH ADVOCATES REALIZING THE BEST HEALTH AND HARMONIOUS SYMBIOSIS OF HUMAN, ANIMAL AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH CROSS-BORDER, MULTI-SECTORAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COOPERATION. THE GOOD GOVERNANCE MODEL IS THE LEADING FACTOR FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE. IN ORDER TO TACKLE THE COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN THE ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, THE VARIATION OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WAS ANALYZED BY A SET OF INDICATORS WITHIN THE ONE HEALTH SYSTEM.METHODTHE CAPACITY OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE WAS ASSESSED AFTER ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET OF INDICATORS FOR THE ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE INDEX (OHGI) FOLLOWING THE METHODOLOGY OF THE GLOBAL ONE HEALTH INDEX. THE DATA TO CALCULATE OHGI WAS COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS DATABASE SOURCES, INCLUDING THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, THE WORLD ORGANIZATION FOR ANIMAL HEALTH, AND OFFICIAL HEALTH-RELATED INSTITUTIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES. EIGHT INDICATORS (INCLUDING 19 SUB-INDICATORS) WERE EMPLOYED IN THE OHGI SYSTEM TO COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATE THE CAPACITY OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE IN 146 COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.RESULTSAMONG THE 146 COUNTRIES SCORED IN THE OHGI SYSTEM, THE AVERAGE SCORE WAS 34.11, WITH A MEDIAN SCORE OF 31.49, RANGED FROM 8.50 TO 70.28. MOST COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER OHGI SCORES COME FROM EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, EAST ASIA AND THE PACIFIC AND NORTH AMERICA, WHILE COUNTRIES WITH THE LOWER OHGI SCORES ARE ALMOST FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. SIX COUNTRIES SCORED MORE THAN 65 POINTS, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, SWEDEN, GERMANY, NETHERLANDS, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND FINLAND, INDICATING THAT THESE COUNTRIES ARE RELATIVELY MATURE IN MOST ASPECTS OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, THERE WERE SOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH OHGI SCORED LOWER THAN 15. THEREFORE, THE GAP BETWEEN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER OHGI SCORES AND THOSE WITH LOWER OHGI SCORES IS MORE THAN 60.CONCLUSIONSGOOD GOVERNANCE ON ONE HEALTH IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR TO MEASURE ONE HEALTH'S GOVERNANCE CAPACITY. THE POLITICAL STABILITY, THE LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE CAPACITY. ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN URGENTLY TO CLOSE THE GAP OF ONE HEALTH GOVERNANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT REGIONS.
52	THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT ABORIGINAL USE OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE SHOULD BE LEGALISED WITHIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. ABORIGINAL PEOPLES HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER S. 35(1) OF THE CONSTITUTION ACT, 1982. THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA DECIDED IN HAIDA THAT IF A CANADIAN GOVERNMENT POSSESSES KNOWLEDGE, REAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE, THAT ITS ACTIONS MAY AFFECT ABORIGINAL INTERESTS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY PROTECTED UNDER S. 35(1), THAT GOVERNMENT THEN HAS DUTIES TOWARDS THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLES CONCERNED. THESE DUTIES CAN INCLUDE GIVING PRIOR NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED ACTION, OR EVEN INTERIM ACCOMMODATION OF THE ABORIGINAL INTERESTS PENDING FINAL RESOLUTION. IF THE CANADIAN STATE UNDERTAKES AN ACTION THAT 1) THREATENS HARM TO OR INTERFERENCE WITH AN ABORIGINAL INTEREST AND 2) IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS A FAILURE TO UPHOLD ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER HAIDA AND 3) THE ACTION IS COMMENCED BEFORE THE INTERIM HEARING CONTEMPLATED BY HAIDA CAN BE INITIATED, ABORIGINAL PEOPLES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TO BLOCK THAT ACTION. THE IDEA IS THAT THE ACTION REFLECTS A FAILURE BY THE STATE TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW WITH RESPECT TO ABORIGINAL RIGHTS AND THEREFORE SHOULD DISENTITLE THE STATE FROM ENFORCING SUCH ACTION THROUGH CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
53	THE PAPER AIMS TO REVIEW THE NEW POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN POLAND, A COUNTRY THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A MAJOR GAME CHANGER WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE. WHEN THE ROLE MODEL OF EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND FORMER COMMUNISTS SATELLITES BECOMES A POLITICAL SURFACE FOR A TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY, A POLARIZED APPROACH USED BY LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY IN ORDER TO SECURE AND BOOST ITS POWER, ANOTHER UNCERTAINTY FALLS IN EUROPE. IN ITS SECTIONS, THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS LED TO LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY'S POLITICAL WIN, THE VITAL AND UNDESIRED THREAT THAT QUICK AND ROUGH POLITICAL MEASURES POSE TO THE RULE OF LAW SYSTEM AND THE RULING PARTY POLITICAL VIEW THAT AIMS TO SECURE AND BOOST ITS POWER IN THE PERILS FROM ITS PROXIMITY, BY ADOPTING A DOUBLE STANDARD POLICY, ONE DISTANT FROM EU'S VALUES AND ANOTHER CLOSE TO NATO'S CORE INTERESTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PAPER EXAMINES THOUGHTFULLY THE DOUBLE STANDARD ISSUE OF WARSAW'S NEW CABINET IN A EUROPEAN UNION THAT HARDLY COPES WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF CRISIS AND AN UNFORESEEN SECURITY LANDSCAPE THAT WITH A NATO TROOPS DEPLOYMENT IN EASTERN EUROPE WILL ESTABLISH, IF NOT A NEW COLD WAR MIND SET, AT LEAST A FROSTY VIEW FROM BOTH RUSSIA AND THE WEST. BY PLAYING A NEGATIVE GAME CHANGER ROLE AND CHOOSING TO CONSIDER A PREVALENCE OF SELF-INTERESTS AMONG ITS EUROPEAN AND EURO-ATLANTIC PARTICIPATION, POLAND FINDS ITSELF IN A RACE THAT MAY DISRUPT DEMOCRACY FOR SECURITY CAUSES, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUDED.
54	THIS ARTICLE WILL ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO 'CRISES' THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS FACING: THE SO-CALLED 'MIGRATION' OR 'REFUGEE CRISIS' AND THE CRISIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, THE TWO CRISES FIND THEIR POINT OF CONNECTION IN THE RESPONSES TO MIGRATORY FLOWS PUT IN PLACE BY THE EU AND SOME OF ITS MEMBER STATES. THE INCREASING MIGRATORY PRESSURE ON EUROPEAN EXTERNAL BORDERS HAS INDUCED SOME GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT A RESTRICTIVE AND SECURITY-DRIVEN APPROACH, CARRIED OUT, ON THE ONE HAND, BY REINFORCING BORDER CONTROLS AND SURVEILLANCE, AND, ON THE OTHER, BY SEEKING THE COOPERATION OF NON-EU COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO CURB MIGRATORY FLOWS, CONTAIN DEPARTURES, AND TACKLE THE MOVEMENTS OF MIGRANTS TOWARDS EUROPE. THESE 'SECURITISATION' AND 'EXTERNALISATION' STRATEGIES ARE IN CONTRAST WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER TWO PERSPECTIVES: ON THE ONE HAND, THEY VIOLATE SOME OF ITS ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL CERTAINTY, DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION, AND CONTROL; ON THE OTHER, THEY BREACH THE SAME PRINCIPLE INSOFAR AS THEY LEAD TO SEVERE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. AS FOR THE FIRST ASPECT, MIGRATION AND BORDER CONTROL POLICIES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE BY FRONTLINE STATES THROUGH A GROWING PROLIFERATION OF ATYPICAL, INFORMAL, AND NON-TRANSPARENT MEASURES OF MIGRATION GOVERNANCE, WHICH, SOUNDING 'LEGAL' WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING SO, ALLOW LEGISLATIVE, PROCEDURAL AND DEMOCRATIC FRAMES TO BE AVOIDED EXAMPLES IN THIS SENSE MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN THE SO-CALLED EU-TURKEY STATEMENT OR IN THE INFORMAL, OVER-SIMPLIFIED COOPERATION ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BY SOME EU FRONTLINE MEMBER STATES WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES, AS IN THE CASE OF ITALY AND NIGER. AS FOR THE SECOND ASPECT, THE IMPACT ON THE RULE OF (HUMAN RIGHTS) NU; OF THE RESPONSE OF SOME EU MEMBER STATES TO THE MIGRATION CRISIS MAY BE MEASURED THROUGH THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, BY CONSIDERING THE DECISIONS CONCERNING THE MOST SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF MIGRANTS' RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE PROHIBITIONS OF REFOULEMENT AND OF COLLECTIVE EXPULSION, AS WELL AS CASES OF ILLEGAL DETENTION AND DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY.
55	IN THE FACE OF A RAPID DECLINE OF RULE OF LAW STANDARDS IN A NUMBER OF EU MEMBER STATES, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER THE HELSINKI PROCESS OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE (OSCE), WHICH WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN STRENGTHENING THE POLITICAL COMMITMENTS TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEIR DEFENDERS DURING THE COLD WAR AND THEREAFTER, CAN STILL DELIVER FOR DEFENDERS IN THE EU TODAY. IT DISCUSSES ISSUES RELATED TO THE CONCERN OF THE OSCE'S FADING RELEVANCE IN ITS HUMAN DIMENSION AND THE ROLE EU MEMBER STATES (EUMS) PLAY IN ITS DECLINE. IN REVIEWING THE EU'S DIPLOMATIC PRACTICE WITHIN THE OSCE, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT IN ITS QUEST FOR UNITY, THE EU HAS GROWN INTO A CARTEL OF SILENCE, EFFECTIVELY WEAKENING THE OSCE'S FOUNDATIONAL LOGIC OF PEER REVIEW AS IT IS UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS IN A FORUM THAT WAS CREATED FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE. THE ARTICLE THEN RECOMMENDS A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH OSCE'S INSTITUTIONS AND POLITICAL BODIES COULD DEVELOP THEIR WORKING METHODS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PARTICULARLY EU CIVIL SOCIETY EXPERTISE WHILE ALSO BEING OPEN TO THEIR CALLS FOR OSCE ACTION.
56	AS IT IS CURRENTLY LEGALLY CONSTITUTED, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POWERS - UNITED STATES, CHINA AND RUSSIA-FOR THE MOST SERIOUS CRIMES THAT CAN BE COMMITTED IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM (UNLESS THEIR MEMBERS COMMIT THE CRIMES ON THE TERRITORY OF A STATE THAT HAS RATIFIED THE ICC). IT IS HARD TO SEE THE RESTRICTED JURISDICTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE BALD PLACING OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL COMMUNITY ABOVE THE LAW WHILE THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY REMAINS SUBJECT TO IT. AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT IS THAT IT IS FOUNDED ON STATE CONSENT. BUT THIS DOES NOT GET THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT ENTIRELY OFF THE HOOK. I WILL ARGUE THAT THE CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT IS ARBITRARY AND IN VIOLATION OF FUNDAMENTAL NORMS OF JUSTICE AND THAT THIS THREATENS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT. WE ARE FACING A LEGITIMACY DILEMMA BETWEEN THE NEED FOR STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE CREATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
57	HUMAN DIGNITY HAS BECOME A CENTRAL LEGAL CONCEPT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IS INCREASINGLY USED IN JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE IT IN THEIR NATIONAL LEGISLATION. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ACKNOWLEDGED VAGUENESS OF THE CONCEPT, ACADEMICS AND JUDGES HAVE IDENTIFIED MANY DIFFICULTIES IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES IT POSES TO THE RULE OF LAW. CONSEQUENTLY, FROM A DOCUMENTARY METHODOLOGY THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO DEVELOP AND PROPOSE, FROM THE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN DIGNITY, A SERIES OF PRINCIPLES THAT CAN BE APPLIED IN JUDICIAL DECISIONS TO ACHIEVE A DEEP COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE USEFULNESS OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, TRIES TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOW WIDELY RECOGNIZED, BOTH BY SUPPORTERS AND CRITICS OF THE JUDICIAL USE OF THIS CONCEPT. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN DIGNITY MUST HAVE A DECISIVE INFLUENCE ON THE FORMATION, NOT ONLY OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW BUT ALSO OF PROCEDURAL LAW. IT MUST BECOME A CRITERION FOR THE NEED FOR MEASURES TO PREVENT THE ABUSE OF PROCEDURAL RIGHTS, THE DISTORTION OF JUSTICE AND THE DELIBERATE EVASION OF ITS MAIN TASK.
58	FOLLOWING THE RUSSIAN FULL-SCALE INVASION OF UKRAINE IN 2022, THE 'DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDER' PARTIES IN HUNGARY (FIDESZ) AND POLAND (LAW AND JUSTICE) TOOK DIFFERING STANCES ON RUSSIA, BRINGING THEIR POSITIONS ON THE RULE OF LAW (ROL) CONFLICT AND WITHIN THE BROADER ALLIANCE OF POPULIST RADICAL RIGHT (PRR) PARTIES INTO QUESTION. BUILDING ON AND ADVANCING THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING AND PRR PARTY COOPERATION, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF EXOGENOUS SHOCKS TRIGGERED BY EXTERNAL AUTHORITARIAN ACTORS ON THESE TYPES OF COLLABORATIONS. A DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE VOTING PATTERNS OF FIDESZ, LAW AND JUSTICE AND OTHER PRR PARTIES IN THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT (EP) IS UNDERTAKEN, AND THEIR STANCES TOWARDS RUSSIA AND THE ROL CONFLICT BEFORE AND AFTER THE INVASION ARE WEIGHED. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE INVASION DID NOT INFLUENCE THE DYNAMICS OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. DESPITE THE RHETORIC, IT ACTUALLY BROUGHT FIDESZ AND LAW AND JUSTICE CLOSER TOGETHER. WHILE THE ATTACK LED TO A CONVERGENCE OF ASSERTIVENESS TOWARDS RUSSIA AMONG THE PRR PARTIES, THE PUTIN REGIME REMAINS A DIVISIVE ISSUE WITHIN THE PRR FAMILY. THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS TOWARDS RUSSIA DID NOT AFFECT THE SUPPORT OF PRRS FOR THE BACKSLIDERS.
59	THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN WIDELY PERCEIVED AS AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, MANY CASES IN POSTCOLONIAL COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TWO MAY NOT ALWAYS BE STRONGLY RELATED. DRAWING FROM THE CASE OF INDONESIA, WE FOUND THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CAN ALSO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A DISTINCTLY ILLIBERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK. INSTEAD OF BEING OBSTACLES, LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AND LAWLESSNESS ARE IN SOME WAYS INSTRUMENTAL IN FACILITATING PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CONSTITUTING THE FAILURE OF LEGAL REFORM. THIS MEANS THAT ILLIBERAL LEGALISM IS NOT AN EXCLUSIVE CHARACTERISTIC OF TRANSITIONAL STATES NOR NECESSARILY THE RESULT OF A CULTURAL FEATURE OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES WHERE MULTIPLE LEGAL SYSTEMS COEXIST. RATHER, ILLIBERAL LEGALISM IS AN OUTCOME OF A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN SOME COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH WHERE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WORK AS AN INSTRUMENT OF RULE. WHILE THERE IS NO SINGLE MODEL OF ILLIBERAL LEGALISM, THE INDONESIAN CASE REPRESENTS AN EXAMPLE WHERE AN ILLIBERAL POLITICO-LEGAL SYSTEM COEXISTS WITH A PREDOMINANTLY RENT-SEEKING ECONOMY. THE INDONESIAN CASE WAS ANALYSED BASED ON FIELDWORK CONDUCTED IN JAKARTA FROM DECEMBER 2019 TO JANUARY 2020 AND SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED UNTIL THE TIME OF WRITING.
60	PURPOSE THIS WRITING REVEALS HONG KONG'S ROLE AS THE CENTER OF CHINA RESEARCH. BEFORE REFORM AND OPENING IN 1979, THE BRITISH COLONY WAS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE ALL INTERNATIONAL CHINA EXPERTS STOPPED OVER AND OBTAINED THE LATEST AND THE MOST ACCURATE ACCOUNTS OF PRC. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER ANALYZES HOW HONG KONG SERVES AS THE INTELLECTUAL MECCA THROUGH EXAMINING THE LIVES OF CHINA SCHOLARS AMID BUILDING UP THEIR INTERNATIONAL PROFILES. WHAT PROMPTED THEM TO JOIN THE CHINA FIELD? HOW WERE THEIR LIVES LIKE IN THE BRITISH CROWN COLONY? THIS PAPER ALSO UNVEILS THE ROLES OF THE TWO RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS PLAYED ON COMMUNIST CHINA STUDIES: UNIVERSITY SERVICES CENTER (USC) AND UNION RESEARCH INSTITUTE (URI). IN ADDITION TO RELYING ON ARCHIVAL CORRESPONDENCES, PERSONAL INTERVIEWS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. FINDINGS DESPITE BEING THE MECCA OF PRC RESEARCH, HONG KONG WAS NOT THE FIRST DESTINATION FOR MOST ASPIRING CHINA SCHOLARS FROM THE WEST. MOST OF THESE WESTERN SCHOLARS DID NOT EVEN PLAN TO DEVOTE THEIR WHOLE WORKING LIVES TO THE STUDY OF CHINA. THROUGH LUCK, DRAFT AVOIDANCE AND GENEROUS GRANTS FROM FORD AND CARNEGIE FOUNDATIONS, THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN BECAME INTERNATIONALLY ICONIC FIGURES OF EAST ASIAN RESEARCH. TO COMPLETE THEIR PH.D. THESES AND SUBSEQUENT CHINA-RELATED PROJECTS, HONG KONG WAS A "MUST-GO" DESTINATION FOR THEM. UNDER THE FULL PROTECTION OF THE UNION JACK, THESE SCHOLARS ENJOYED THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK, WRITE, RESEARCH AND PUBLISH. GOD BLESSED HONG KONG WITH SUCH A UNIQUE POLITICAL STATUS AMID THE COLD WAR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE 155 ARGYLE STREET WAS THE ART DECO COMPOUND WHERE RED CHINA EXPERTS PRODUCED MOST GROUNDBREAKING SCHOLARSHIPS. IT WAS NOT ONLY A TWO-STORY STRUCTURE WHERE THEY ACQUIRED THEIR FIRST-HAND RESOURCES BUT A PLATFORM WHERE ANY CHINA-RELATED TOPICS WERE DISCUSSED OPENLY UNDER THE AUSPICES OF BRITISH COLONIAL RULE OF LAW. DESPITE CLAIMING THEMSELVES AS APOLITICAL, BOTH USC AND URI WERE PRODUCTS OF US CONTAINMENT POLICY AGAINST COMMUNISM. EVEN SO, THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT NEVER PROHIBITED THE TWO'S OPERATIONS. THROUGH THIS PAPER, READERS WILL ALSO DISCOVER HOW YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN BECAME INSPIRED INTO A CAREER IN CHINA STUDIES.
61	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A LEGAL COMMUNITY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, ESTABLISHED IN A SINGLE MARKET THROUGH EUROPEAN LAW. THIS IS TIED TO LANGUAGE AND TRANSLATION INTO 24 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES, EACH WITH EQUALLY AUTHENTIC STATUS. HOWEVER, THIS LEADS TO CONSIDERABLE LEGAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEMBER STATES AND UNDERSCORES THE DOMINANCE OF ENGLISH, AT THE COURT OF JUSTICE THAT OF FRENCH (MONOLINGUALISM), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE NO LEGAL FOUNDATION. RULE-OF-LAW ORDER (RECHTSSTAATLICHKEIT) IS CREATED BY THE EUROPEAN REFERENCE LANGUAGE SYSTEM (EUROPAISCHES REFERENZSPRACHENSYSTEM), WHICH IS PRESENTED HERE AS A TOOL FOR THE URGENTLY REQUIRED REFORM OF THE LANGUAGE LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION: NOT HAVING A HEGEMONIAL FOCUS ON A SINGLE LANGUAGE (AND THUS ON A SINGLE LEGALWORLD) OR ON THE EXCLUSIVITY OF SOME FEW LANGUAGES, IT OFFERS A LEGAL-LINGUISTIC BASIS OF COMMUNICATION WITH ALL TREATY LANGUAGES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR A CLEAR EUROPEAN LAW AND PROSPERITY. THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES OF THE MEMBER STATES THUS PRESERVE THE MOTHER TONGUE REALITY OF THE CITIZENS IN THE SENSE OF THE SUBSIDIARITY PRINCIPLE (MULTILINGUALISM). IN THIS WAY, THE CITIZENS AND THEIR UNION ACQUIRE A LEGALLY VALID VOICE AND IDENTITY. THIS SEEMS NECESSARY IN THE FACE OF THE PRESENT RESTRUCTURING OF THE WORLD, IN ORDER TOMAINTAIN PEACE FOR THE PEOPLE IN EUROPE AND TO CONTINUE PROMOTING THEIR WELL-BEING. THE BASIS IS LEGAL LINGUISTICS (RECHTSLINGUISTIK).
62	THE PRINCIPIA IURIS THEORY OF LAW COULD BE DISTINGUISHED BY THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES: BY THE SUBJECT MATTER IT DEALS WITH (I. E. SEMANTIC ASPECT); BY ITS PURPOSE (I. E. PRAGMATIC ASPECT); AND BY THE METHOD USED TO CONSTRUCT IT (I. E. SYNTACTIC ASPECT). REGARDING THE SEMANTIC POINT OF VIEW IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS BEING BOTH A WIDE AND ELASTIC THEORY OF LAW (DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT ALMOST ANY LEGAL SYSTEM) AS WELL AS A NORMATIVIST AND REALIST ONE (GIVEN THAT IT EMBRACES THE NORMATIVE AND THE FACTUAL ASPECTS OF THE LEGAL PHENOMENON). IN THE PRAGMATIC ASPECT, THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE THEORY IS TO REDEFINE THE THEORETICAL AND NORMATIVE PARADIGM OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, IN ORDER TO MAKE BOTH ITS PRINCIPLES AND THE DIVERGENCES BETWEEN THE LEGAL PRACTICES AND THESE PRINCIPLES VERY CLEAR. BUT THE PRIME NOVELTY OF PRINCIPIA IURIS IS THAT IT USES THE AXIOMATIC METHOD IN ITS RECONSTRUCTION, THUS ALLOWING A CLEARER AND MORE LOGICAL CONTROL OF ITS THESES.
63	THE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES OF ANY MODERN SYSTEM OF LAW, AND THUS, IT IS ALSO OF OUR CRIMINAL COURT PROCEEDINGS. FOR A LONG TIME, THE SPANISH CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL ACT, HAS LACKED A REGULATION IN RELATION TO INVESTIGATIVE ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ORIGINATED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE APPEARANCE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES, AND THIS HAS CREATED NOT FEW PROCEDURAL NEW PROBLEMS. THE LEGAL REFORM UNDERTAKEN BY THE ACT 13/2015, DATED OCTOBER 5TH, AIMS AT SOLVING THIS SITUATION OF LACK OF SUFFICIENT LEGISLATION. WE STUDY IN THIS PAPER THE DEMANDS ARISEN FROM THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE WITH THE INTENTION OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE NEW ACT 13/2015 PROPERLY DEFINES THE MODALITIES AND THE SCOPE OF THE POWER ATTRIBUTED TO AUTHORITIES, SO AS TO AFFORD INDIVIDUALS WITH AN ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY. WE INTEND TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT, AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES, INTROMISSIONS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS RECOGNIZED BY SECTION 18 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION CARRIED OUT AS PART OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WOULD BE LEGITIMATE.
64	THE POPULARIZATION OF EDUCATION ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPULSION LAW IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR EPIDEMIC SITUATIONS IN CHINA REFERS TO THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY AN EDUCATIONAL SUBJECT AIMED AT AN EDUCATIONAL OBJECT PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING AND MASTERY OF KNOWLEDGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE COMPULSION. THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNMENT'S LEGAL ABILITY TO PREVENT AND CONTROL BEHAVIOR, ENHANCE PEOPLE'S AWARENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROVIDE A STRONG LEGAL BASIS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF MAJOR EPIDEMICS. OTHER AIMS ARE TO CULTIVATE CITIZENS' LEGAL BELIEFS, RESTRAIN CITIZENS' CONDUCT, AND MAINTAIN A STABLE SOCIAL ORDER. HOWEVER, PROBLEMS ARISE IN THE SUBJECT, CONTENT, AND MODE OF THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO DISCUSS COMPULSORY EDUCATION IN THE CONTEXT OF MAJOR EPIDEMIC SITUATIONS, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR A FAVORABLE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, THE STRENGTHENING OF INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION, AND THE GUIDANCE OF PUBLIC OPINION ON ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT. WE SHOULD ALSO IMPROVE EDUCATION SUBJECTS TO ENHANCE THE LEGAL QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANS, PERFECT THE EDUCATION CONTENT, ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATIVE COMPULSION IN EPIDEMIC SITUATIONS, AND DELIVER EDUCATION IN CAMPUS ONLINE CLASSES.
65	CODIFICATION CONVENTIONS AND DRAFT ARTICLES COMPLETED BY THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION ARE OFTEN-AND INCREASINGLY-INVOKED BY COURTS, TRIBUNALS, GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AS 'REFLECTIONS OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW'. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE FACTORS EXPLAINING THE AUTHORITY THAT THESE 'NON-LEGISLATIVE CODIFICATIONS' HAVE COME TO ENJOY IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL REASONING. MOVING BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL EXPLANATIONS OF CODIFICATION CONVENTIONS AS EVIDENCE OF STATE PRACTICE AND ILC DRAFT ARTICLES AS THE TEACHING OF PUBLICISTS, IT CONSIDERS HOW, AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS (RELATING TO AUTHORSHIP, REPRESENTATION AND PROCEDURE) AND TEXTUAL FACTORS (INCLUDING PRESCRIPTIVE FORM AND THE ABSENCE OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'CODIFICATION' AND 'PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT') CONVERGE TO CONVEY THE IMAGE THAT THE RESULTING TEXTS CONSTITUTE THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE RESTATEMENT OF THE EXISTING LAW. IT THEN ASSESSES THIS PHENOMENON IN LIGHT OF THE POLITICAL IDEAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. WHILE NON-LEGISLATIVE CODIFICATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO ENHANCING THE CLARITY, CONSISTENCY AND CONGRUENCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE FACT THAT THEY MAY PORTRAY NOVEL RULES AS REFLECTING EXISTING LAW INEVITABLY RAISES LEGALITY CONCERNS.
66	IN EARLIER SCHOLARSHIP ON TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES THAT BECAME COLONISED, RELATIONS BETWEEN IMPORTED LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INDIGENOUS CUSTOMS THAT HAD LONG OPERATED WITH QUASI-LEGAL EFFECT ARE OFTEN STUDIED IN TERMS OF CONFLICT AND OPPOSITION, TO SHOW HOW WESTERN OR EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS PROGRESSIVELY DISPLACED WHAT EXISTED BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL. IN HER MORE RECENT STUDIES OF LEGAL PLURALISM, HOWEVER, LAUREN BENTON ARGUES PERSUASIVELY FROM MANY HISTORICAL EXAMPLES AND CASES THAT INDIGENOUS CULTURE AND CONTINGENT HISTORICAL SITUATIONS ARE MAJOR FORCES THAT MEDIATE LEGAL DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE. THOUGH ACKNOWLEDGING HER DEBT TO HOMI BHABHA'S THEORISING OF HYBRIDISED SUBJECTS AND THEIR DISRUPTIONS OF ASYMMETRICAL COLONIAL RELATIONS, BENTON NONETHELESS CRITIQUES BHABHA'S ASSUMPTION OF `A PREEXISTING AND RELATIVELY CONSTANT CULTURAL DIVIDE' (BENTON AND MUTH 2000).
67	THE DEMOCRACY'S PRINCIPLE CAN BE UNDERSTAND AS A EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLE, DEEPLY LINKED TO THE SAME EXISTENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT IN EACH OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, OF THE EUROPEAN UNION RIGHT. THIS CHARACTER OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY IS SHOWED IN THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE TERM AND IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONCEPT AS A GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, BUT ALSO THE OTHER PRINCIPLES THAT ARE RELATED TO IT SUCH AS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE, THE CONSTITUTION'S SUPREMACY PRINCIPLE, THE SUBMISSION TO THE LAW, THE LEGAL SECURITY'S PRINCIPLE ALL THE EQUALITY PRINCIPLE.
68	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN RECONQUEST, REPOPULATION AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF CASTILIAN AS AN OFFICIAL WRITTEN LANGUAGE. WHILE RECENT RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON HOW THE CASTILIAN MONARCHY SOUGHT TO INVENT WRITTEN CASTILIAN AS A SACRED SCRIPT COMPARABLE TO LATIN, ARABIC AND HEBREW, OR SIMPLY AS A PRESTIGIOUS LANGUAGE OF CULTURE, MY READING OF SIETE PARTIDAS IS MORE CONCERNED WITH VERNACULAR WRITING AS A REGULATORY PRACTICE AND VERNACULAR WRITINGS AS ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS SANCTIONED BY THE CROWN TO FACILITATE THE SOCIO-JURIDICAL CONTROL OF REPOPULATED SPACES AND PEOPLES. ULTIMATELY, THE PRACTICAL DEMANDS OF TERRITORIAL CONQUEST WERE MORE CRITICAL TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF SPANISH WRITING THAN ANY PURELY CULTURAL CONCERNS THE CROWN MAY HAVE HAD.
69	ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE EUROPEANIZATION OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC MODELS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALKANS. HOWEVER, RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL CRISES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA HAVE FAILED TO ENSURE THAT ALL CANDIDATE STATES HAVE REACHED THE REQUIRED DEGREE OF STABILITY IN THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS BEFORE ACCESSION. WHY DID THE EU FAIL TO SCREEN OUT THOSE APPLICANTS THAT AS YET LACKED SUFFICIENTLY STRONG DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, DESPITE THE GREAT EFFORTS MADE DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS? BY CLARIFYING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EU VALUE ORDER AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS OF THE MEMBER STATES, REVISITING THE EVOLUTION OF THE EU VALUE-PROTECTING MECHANISM, AND ANALYZING THE SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS BEHIND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISES IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE OVERHASTY PACE OF THE ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS, AND THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT VALUE-PROTECTING MECHANISM WAS UNABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY EMPOWER CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE CANDIDATE STATES, ARE IMPORTANT REASONS FOR THE WEAKNESS OF THE CURRENT MECHANISM.
70	THE DECISION OF MARTIN J IN MINERALOGY PTY LTD V WESTERN AUSTRALIA PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF DOMESTIC ARBITRAL AWARDS AND, IN PARTICULAR, COUNSELS AGAINST BRINGING ENFORCEMENT APPLICATIONS ON AN EX PARTE BASIS.
71	WE INVESTIGATE THE RESOURCE CURSE PHENOMENON USING THE AFRICAN GOVERNANCE INDEX THAT RANKS AFRICAN COUNTRIES ACCORDING TO THEIR GOVERNANCE QUALITY. FIRST, WE ALLOW COUNTRIES TO ENDOGENOUSLY SELECT IN GOOD- AND BAD-GOVERNANCE GROUPS. SECONDLY, USING AN ARELLANO-BOND DYNAMIC PANEL-DATA ESTIMATION. WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT ON BAD-GOVERNANCE COUNTRIES OF THE ENDOWMENT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT (I) THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TODAY DEPENDS ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN RECENT YEARS AND (II) THAT THE RESOURCE ENDOWMENT TODAY WILL PRODUCE A LAGGED EFFECT ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF THE RESOURCE CURSE PROBLEM.
72	ON 21 JUNE 2007, THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER JOHN HOWARD DECLARED WAR. IN RESPONSE TO THE LATEST IN A LINE OF REPORTS ABOUT CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE, HE DECLARED A 'ATIONAL EMERGENCY' AND SWIFTLY SUSPENDED THE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION ACT 1975 (RDA). 1 HE DEPLOYED OVER 600 MILITARY PERSONNEL, FEDERAL AUSTRALIAN POLICE AND THE AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION (ACC) INVESTIGATORS INTO 73 TARGETED ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL AUSTRALIA. AS A RESULT, THESE COMMUNITIES SAW ALCOHOL AND PORNOGRAPHY BANNED, MANDATORY INCOME QUARANTINING REGIMES INTRODUCED, COMMUNITY ASSETS SEIZED AND THE GOVERNMENT COMPULSORILY REACQUIRING ABORIGINAL LAND ON FIVE-YEAR LEASES.
73	THE PRESENT STUDY DEVELOPS A THEORETICAL ARGUMENT THAT RESEARCH ON POLICE USE OF FORCE SHOULD BEGIN TO EXAMINE THE PHENOMENON IN TERMS OF POLICE OCCUPATIONAL TEMPLATES ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL ESCALATION OF FORCE PARADIGM. INVESTIGATING POLICE USE OF FORCE THROUGH THE LENSES OF OCCUPATIONAL TEMPLATES (E. G., THE SYMBOLIC ASSAILANT AND THE ASSHOLE) MAY PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE GOALS OF POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY APPLIED THE FORCE-I. E., WHETHER THEY PRIMARILY WISHED TO CONTROL SUSPECTS FROM A DISTANCE, OR RETALIATE FOR AN AFFRONT TO THEIR AUTHORITY. THE STUDY USES AN ANALYTICAL STRATEGY DESIGNED TO EXAMINE A CATEGORICAL USE OF FORCE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, WHICH RELAXES THE ASSUMPTIONS OF RANK-ORDER, IN AN EFFORT TO DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS OF FORCE BASED ON A SET OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. THOUGH THE DATA ARE SEVERELY LIMITED, THE STUDY FINDS EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE USE OF OCCUPATIONAL TEMPLATES IN THE EXAMINATION OF USE OF FORCE.
74	THE AIM OF THIS ESSAY IS TO STUDY THE ORIGIN AND THE MEANING OF THE WORD DEMOKRATIA, AS WELL AS OF THE REGIME REFERRED TO BY IT AND ITS CONSTITUTING INSTITUTIONS IN CLASSICAL GREECE. I WILL EXAMINE, FIRST, (1) THE ORIGIN AND PRIMITIVE MEANING OF THE TERM. THEN I WILL REVIEW (2) THE INSTITUTIONS OF ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY AS THEY WERE EXPOUNDED BY ARISTOTLE (OR BY ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES) IN THE ATHENIAN CONSTITUTION (ATHENAION POLITEIA). THIRDLY, (3) I WILL ANALYZE THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE FIVE SPECIES OF DEMOCRACY AS FOUND IN ARISTOTLE'S POLITICS, BOOKS IV-VI. ONCE I HAD STIPULATED THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE SPECIES, (4) I WILL TURN TO THE ARISTOTELIAN CONCEPTION OF THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, REPUBLIC AND OLIGARCHY. THE STUDY OF THE NOTION OF DEMOCRACY AND ITS TRADITIONAL ALTERNATIVE REGIME, OLIGARCHY, WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT (5) EXPLORING THE CAUSES OF SEDITION AND INSTABILITY, TO WHICH BOTH THESE REGIMES ARE PRONE. FINALLY, (6) I WILL TREAT THE QUESTION ARISTOTLE LEFT OPEN FOR POSTERITY: IS "DEMOCRACY" THE RULE OF LAW OR THE RULE OF THE MASSES?
75	THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE LAW VERIFICATION IN THE LIGHT OF THE WORK OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS BODIES. THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES SEVERAL AREAS OF SUCH ANALYSIS - DAILY, ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY, AND ALSO ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ISSUE OF CORRUPTION AND ITS CONTROL IN THE FRAMEWORK OF PROVIDING THE RULE OF LAW IN VERIFICATION PRACTICE.
76	WE ADVANCE RESEARCH ON HUMAN CAPITAL AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY AND POSIT THAT, IN ORDER TO GENERATE VALUE, SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP REQUIRES DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF HUMAN CAPITAL THAN COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE DEVELOP A MULTILEVEL FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE THE COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC HUMAN CAPITAL, OF NATIONAL CONTEXT AND ITS MODERATING EFFECT ON THE HUMAN CAPITAL-ENTREPRENEURSHIP RELATIONSHIP. WE FIND THAT SPECIFIC ENTREPRENEURIAL HUMAN CAPITAL IS RELATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT IN COMMERCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND GENERAL HUMAN CAPITAL IN SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND THAT THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN CAPITAL DEPEND ON THE RULE OF LAW.

77	TERRORISM STANDS AT THE EVOLUTIONARY PEEK OF THE EXPANSION OF WESTERN CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEMS. THIS EVOLUTION CONTRADICTS MANY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF WESTERN CRIMINAL LAW, TO THE EXTENT THAT A REAL "CRIMINAL LAW" FOR ENEMIES APPEARS ON THE NEAR HORIZON OF PENAL LEGISLATION. THE BASIC ARGUMENT HERE IS THE IDEA THAT CRIMINAL LAW IS AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT TO FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. YET A THOROUGH ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THIS OVERSTATES THE PREVENTIVE CAPACITY OF THE PENAL SYSTEM. TO THE CONTRARY, GIVEN THE COMMUNICATION STRATEGY EMBODIED IN TERRORISM, A PENAL OVERREACTION COULD BE QUITE DYSFUNCTIONAL FOR THE OBJECTIVE OF FIGHTING TERRORISM: IN PARTICULAR, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A REAL SOLUTION IN PREVENTIVE TERMS, IT MAY CAUSE A CONTAMINATION EFFECT THAT COULD MODIFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE OVERALL PENAL LAW SYSTEM.
78	THIS WORK ANALIZES THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIVATE AUTONOMY IN THE AFFECTIVE RELATIONS CONTEXT. IT APPROACHES THE LEGAL FUNDAMENTS OF THE CONTEMPORARY FAMILY, WHICH IS ESSENCIALY BASED IN COOPERATION AND TAKES ON NEW CHARACTERISTICS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE HUMAN DIGNITIES' PROMOTION WILL BE ACOMPLISHED IN THE CORE OF THE FAMILY BY THE FULL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICES, BE IT IN THE CONSTITUTION WAY OF THE FAMILIAR UNITY BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE HOMOSEXUAL UNION RIGHTS. THE PRIVATE AUTONOMY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FREEDOM, AUTONOMY AND VOLITION TO ALOUD THE LEGAL PROTECTION TO THE HOMOSEXUAL FAMILY. THROUGH THIS POINT OF VIEW, WE'LL ANALISE THE MARRIAGE AS PROPOSED IN THE CIVIL CODE, VERIFYING IF THE LEGAL DISCIPLINE MATCHES WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPOLOGY. THE MARRIAGE WILL BE ANALIZED IN THE CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY'S HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ITS MEANS OF PROCREATION, HERITAGE PROTECTION AND OF INDISSOLUBILITY CARACTERISTICHS CHANGE AND IS BECOMING AN ENVIRONMET TO SAFEGUARD PLURARITY, HUMAN DIGNITY PROMOTION, EQUALITY PRESERVATION AND THE NON-DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL SUSTAIN THE POSSIBILITY OF HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGE ACHIEVEMENT BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES ABOVE MENTIONED. WE SUSTAIN THE THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEAN OF PROMOTING HOMOSEXUAL AND HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES EQUALITY IS, PRECISELY, ALOUD THEM TO SAFEGUARD THE SAME RIGHTS. WE ADVOCATE THAT THE MARIAGE CONCESSION MUST BE DONE BY THE CONTITUCIONAL COMAND FORCE OF EQUALITY, INDEPENDENTLY OF CONSIDERATIONS ON THE GENDER.
79	DO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WHO HAVE TAKEN AN AFFIRMATIVE OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, HAVE ANY LEGITIMATE CLAIM TO DISOBEY THE LAW? WE ARGUE THAT THEY DO. INDEED, THE NATURE OF LAW ITSELF REQUIRES OFFICIALS TO HAVE SOME MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THE SECONDARY RULES OR IF ONE PREFERS, THE ASSOCIATIVE OBLIGATIONS, UPON WHICH THEIR AUTHORITY IS BASED. WHEN INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES AND OFFICIAL BEHAVIOR MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR OFFICIALS TO SUBORDINATE GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY TO THE RULE OF LAW, THEN OTHER OFFICIALS MAY BE EXCUSED FROM LEGAL CONSTRAINTS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY. WE USE ARGUMENTS FROM LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL THEORY TO ILLUSTRATE THIS NARROW EXCUSE.
80	SELF-GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS CAN AID THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC LEGAL REFORM, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDS ON BUILDING MEANINGFUL LINKAGES OF TRUST AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE JUDGES THEY REPRESENT.
81	THE INCREASING INTEREST OF LEGAL ACADEMIA ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND ITS GROWING ENFORCEMENT BY THE JUDICIARY IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS HAS STARTED TO NORMALIZE A DOCTRINE THAT WAS CONSIDERED CONTROVERSIAL AND EXTRAORDINARY. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO CAST SOME DOUBTS ON THE USE OF THIS DOCTRINE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COURT THAT ENFORCES IT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AMENDMENT ITSELF. IN THE FIRST SECTION IT WILL QUESTION THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DOCTRINE BY RECOURSE TO LEGAL THEORY, FOCUSING NOT ONLY ON THE IDEA OF CONSTITUENT POWER, BUT ALSO ON THOSE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE SECOND SECTION, SOME COMPARATIVE CASES OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WILL BE ANALYZED, FOCUSING ON THOSE WHERE THE JUDICIARY ITSELF WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE AMENDMENT. FINALLY, FROM A NORMATIVE AND CONCEPTUAL STANDPOINT, A DIALOGIC APPROACH TO THE APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE WILL BE PROPOSED, TO MITIGATE THE FACT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS CAN BECOME AN UNACCOUNTABLE ACCOUNTABILITY-HOLDER.
82	THIS CONTRIBUTION DRAWS ATTENTION TO HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF JUSTICE TO DEAL WITH REQUESTS THAT ARE EITHER MADE DIRECTLY OR MAY PROVE INDIRECTLY TO BE RELEVANT TO MUSLIMS WHO CLAIM THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND FAITH IN CONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN SOCIETIES. THE ANALYSIS IS DISTRIBUTED OVER TWO DISTINCT BUT COMPLEMENTARY ILLUSTRATIONS OF SUCH CLAIMS. THE POSITION DEFENDED HERE IS THAT THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY LIES IN ENABLING ADHERENTS OF ALL RELIGIONS AND BELIEFS, AND THUS ALSO MUSLIMS, TO PARTICIPATE TO THE SAME EXTENT, FULLY AND ACTIVELY, IN SOCIAL LIFE, BOTH AS CITIZENS AND AS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. THE CHALLENGE LIES IN FINDING THE BALANCE BETWEEN LOOKING AFTER THE INTERESTS OF THE MAJORITY SOCIETY AND MEETING THE NEEDS AND WISHES OF MINORITY GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PERCEIVED TO BE 'NEW'.</P>
83	THE POLITICAL OUTLOOK OF THE SO-CALLED 'ANONYMUS IAMBLICHI' (DK 89) HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY IN THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE, WITH SOME COMMENTATORS JUDGING HIM TO BE A COMMITTED DEMOCRAT, WHILE OTHERS SEE IN HIM A PARTISAN OF ARISTOCRACY OR EVEN OLIGARCHY. THIS DISAGREEMENT IS NOT SURPRISING, FOR THE TEXT CONTAINS PASSAGES THAT SEEM TO PULL IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT WE MOVE BEYOND THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL OLIGARCH-OR-DEMOCRAT MODEL TRADITIONALLY EMPLOYED AND INSTEAD APPROACH THE ISSUE FROM A FRESH ANGLE, APPLYING THE MORE NUANCED TYPOLOGY FOR UNDERSTANDING ANCIENT SOCIAL CRITICISM ('REJECTIONIST' VS 'IMMANENT') DEVELOPED BY JOSIAH OBER. THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY SITUATING THE AUTHOR WITHIN THE SOCIAL LANDSCAPE OF CLASSICAL ATHENS. THE RESULTING CHARACTERIZATION PRESENTS THE AUTHOR AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A DISTINCTIVE SOCIAL TYPE: THE ATHENIAN 'RICH QUIETIST', WHO PREFERS PRIVATE ECONOMIC ENDEAVOURS TO ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AND WHO IS IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF HOW DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY TREATS ITS WEALTHY CITIZENS. THIS CHARACTERIZATION HELPS MAKE BETTER SENSE OF THE SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY POLITICAL INDICATIONS IN THE TEXT. IN PARTICULAR, FRAGMENTS 6 AND 7 SHOULD BE READ AS A SINGLE LINE OF ARGUMENT, WHICH TAKES THE FORM OF AN 'IMMANENT CRITIQUE' OF CONTEMPORARY ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY. ACCORDING TO 'ANONYMUS IAMBLICHI', DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY RIGHTLY PRAISES THE RULE OF LAW AS A DISTINCTIVE DEMOCRATIC VALUE, BUT IT FALLS DISAPPOINTINGLY SHORT OF THAT IDEAL IN ITS TREATMENT OF ITS OWN WEALTHY ELITE CITIZENS.
84	SINCE DMITRY MEDVEDEV'S DESIGNATION BY VLADIMIR PUTIN AS HIS CANDIDATE TO REPLACE HIM AS RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY MEDVEDEV'S ELECTORAL VICTORY AND HIS INAUGURATION ON 7 MAY, MANY ANALYSES HAVE TRIED TO PREDICT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE NEW PRESIDENT, AND THE DIFFERENCES IN COMPARISON TO HIS MENTOR AND PREDECESSOR. MEDVEDEV'S STATEMENTS DURING THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN HAVE HAD A GREAT IMPACT, AND MANY HAVE INTERPRETED THEM AS AN EVIDENCE OF A MORE OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC ATTITUDE THAN PUTIN'S. BUT AFTER EXAMINING THE SAME STATEMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF MEDVEDEV'S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, WE HAVE TO MODERATE THAT OPTIMISM.
85	BASED ON THE UPDATED DOGMATIC OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, THROUGH THE METHODOLOGY OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REVIEW AND DOCUMENT ANALYSIS, THIS RESEARCH ANALYZES THE BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL NORMS THAT REGULATE THE BIOSAFETY IN THE COUNTRY, IN PARTICULAR THE LAW 11.105 OF 2005 FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHECKING IF THIS SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF THE ECOLOGICALLY BALANCED ENVIRONMENT AND TO GUARANTEE THE POPULATION'S QUALITY OF LIFE. CONSIDERING THAT THE USE OF TRANSGENIC ORGANISMS IN RURAL FARMING ENHANCES ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS, IT'S ESSENTIAL THE STUDY OF BIOSAFETY NORMS IN VIEW OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW STATE. THE COMPREHENSION OF THE BRAZILIAN BIOSAFETY STRUCTURE DEMANDS THE STUDY OF ITS EPISTEMOLOGICAL BASES FROM BIOETHICS, AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT THAT SPREAD INTERNATIONALLY SINCE 80'S AND WHICH WAS EXPRESSED IN VARIOUS CONVENTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS. IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES, INFLUENCED BY WESTERN RATIONAL MODERNIZATION PROCESS, BIOSAFETY IS AT THE HEART OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, AS PROCEDURES AND SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES EXERT LARGE EFFECTS, AND INCREASINGLY MORE REPRESENTATIVE, ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE THAT THE BRAZILIAN BIOSAFETY SYSTEM HAS CONFLICTING ASPECTS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW STATE, BOTH IN DEMOCRATIC AND ECOLOGICAL TERMS, RESULTING FROM LEGAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS.
86	THE POSITIONING OF ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW DEPENDS ON ITS UNIQUE VALUE, GOAL AND FUNCTION. FROM THE BEGINNING, ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW HAS HAD A GREAT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC MISSION, AND CAN BECOME A "SUPER LAW" WITH A GRAND VALUE GOAL AND A POWERFUL FUNCTION IN ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT. THE UNIQUENESS OF THE INTERNET, IN CAPITAL, TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELS, EASILY ALLOWS INTERNET PLATFORMS TO GROW ANARCHICALLY, AND TO HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION WITH ANTI-MONOPOLY CONCERNS. INTERNET ANTI-MONOPOLY POLICY SHOULD FIRST EXPAND ITS THINKING AND ELEVATE ITS STANCE IN MACRO VALUE, AND SEEK APPROPRIATE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC TECHNICAL PATHS. CHINA'S INTERNET PLATFORM ANTI-MONOPOLY POLICY CANNOT SIMPLY FOLLOW TODAY'S INTERNATIONAL AND SUPERFICIAL TREND, WHICH DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AND MAY CONCEAL VARIOUS INTERESTS. INSTEAD, CHINA'S INTERNET PLATFORM ANTI-MONOPOLY POLICY SHOULD ACTIVELY FOLLOW, RESPECT AND SERVE THE SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT INTERESTS OF CHINA'S DIGITAL ECONOMY, OPERATING IN A TIMELY FASHION AND AT THE RIGHT LOCATION, IN WAYS THAT ARE OPPORTUNE, MODERATE AND MODEST. IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE COMMITTED TO THE INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S INTERNET INDUSTRY AND TO INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. INTERNET ANTI-MONOPOLY POLICY SHOULD ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW, BUILD A CORRESPONDING RULE SYSTEM, ENSURE OBJECTIVITY, NEUTRALITY AND RATIONALITY, AND PREVENT IRRATIONALITY AND OVER-EXCITEMENT.
87	MAFIA ORGANIZATIONS HAVE LONG BEEN A THREAT TO CHINESE SOCIETY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAFIA ORGANIZATIONS IN CHINA HAVE EXPERIENCED FOUR STAGES: FORMATION, DYING OUT, RESURGENCE, AND RECURRENCE. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE GOVERNANCE OF MAFIA ORGANIZATIONS AND HAS SUPPRESSED MAFIA FORCES WITH SOME NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS. IN JANUARY 2018, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CARRIED OUT A NATIONWIDE SPECIAL CAMPAIGN, "SWEEPING AND ELIMINATING EVILS" [SAO HEI CHU' E], TO CRACK DOWN GANGS' CRIMES IN CHINA. DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS ACTIONS, THE RECENT CAMPAIGN HAS CHANGED ITS FOCUS FROM "FIGHTING" [DA] TO "SWEEPING" [SAO], SHOWING THE CHANGING FOCUS OF BEIJING'S STRATEGY IN THE CRACKDOWN ON MAFIA ORGANIZATIONS. IN VIEW OF THIS, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF CHINA'S GOVERNANCE OF MAFIA ORGANIZATION CRIMES IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT FROM A HISTORICAL, NORM-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. ON THE BASIS OF A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAFIA ORGANIZATIONS IN CHINA, THIS STUDY, DRAWING ON THE CURRENT SITUATION, DISCUSSES THE PROCESS AND MAIN STRATEGIES OF THE MAFIA ORGANIZATION GOVERNANCE, AND ANALYSES THE REASONS FOR AND THE PROBLEMS IN THE SPECIAL CAMPAIGN "SWEEPING AND ELIMINATING EVILS" IN THE NEW ERA. THIS STUDY ALSO PROVIDES PLANS AND SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO ADVANCE THE CAMPAIGN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
88	PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF STOCK MARKET VALUATION ON HAPPINESS AMONG STOCK INVESTORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSED HOW THE STOCK MARKET AFFECTS THE OVERALL HAPPINESS OF A COUNTRY. WE CONDUCTED FURTHER EXPLORATION OF ADDITIONAL MECHANISMS THAT MODERATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STOCK MARKET VALUATION AND HAPPINESS LEVEL. BASED ON A 68-CROSSCOUNTRY DATASET FROM 2010 TO 2017, WE EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STOCK MARKET VALUATION AND HAPPINESS. WE FOUND THAT THE STOCK MARKET INDEX WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF HAPPINESS. FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED THAT THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WAS WEAKER IN COUNTRIES WITH AN UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH (HIGH GINI) BUT STRONGER IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR ENDOGENEITY USING INSTRUMENT VARIABLES, LAG VARIABLES, AND CHANGE MODELS. ADDITIONAL TEST RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE HIGHER STOCK MARKET INDEX AND THE HIGHER HAPPINESS LEVEL WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATED BY POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION.
89	DEVELOPMENTS IN DATA ANALYTICS, COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES HAVE DRIVEN ALL BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT TO OUTSOURCE AUTHORITY TO MACHINES IN PERFORMING PUBLIC FUNCTIONS-SOCIAL WELFARE, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, COURTS. COMPLEX STATISTICAL ALGORITHMS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS ARE BEING USED TO AUTOMATE DECISION-MAKING AND ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. CONTROVERSIES HAVE EMERGED REGARDING THE OPAQUE NATURE OF SUCH SCHEMES, THE UNINTENTIONAL BIAS AGAINST AND HARM TO UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS, AND THE BROADER LEGAL, SOCIAL AND ETHICAL RAMIFICATIONS. STATE V LOOMIS, A RECENT CASE IN THE USA, WELL DEMONSTRATES HOW UNRESTRAINED AND UNCHECKED OUTSOURCING OF PUBLIC POWER TO MACHINES MAY UNDERMINE HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. WITH A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE CASE, THIS ARTICLE UNPACKS THE ISSUES OF THE 'LEGAL BLACK BOX' AND THE 'TECHNICAL BLACK BOX' TO IDENTIFY THE RISKS POSED BY RAMPANT 'ALGORITHMIZATION' OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS TO DUE PROCESS, EQUAL PROTECTION AND TRANSPARENCY. WE FURTHER ASSESS SOME IMPORTANT GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS AND SUGGEST WAYS FOR IMPROVING THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF AI-FACILITATED DECISIONS. AS AI SYSTEMS ARE COMMONLY EMPLOYED IN CONSEQUENTIAL SETTINGS ACROSS JURISDICTIONS, TECHNOLOGICALLY INFORMED GOVERNANCE MODELS ARE NEEDED TO LOCATE OPTIMAL INSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS THAT STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF ALGORITHMIZATION.
90	CHINESE OFFICIALS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO A POLICY KNOWN AS INFORMATISATION, CONNECTING INDUSTRY ONLINE, TO UTILISE TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TACKLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS IN CHINA. HOWEVER, VARIOUS RECENT LAWS HAVE MADE FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY FIRMS UNEASY ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. WILL THESE NEW LAWS, UNDER CHINA'S STATED POLICY OF "NETWORK SOVEREIGNTY" ("WANGLUO ZHUQUAN") AFFECT CHINA'S ABILITY TO ATTRACT FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY FIRMS, TALENT AND IMPORTANTLY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS? WILL THEY SLOW CHINA'S TECHNOLOGY AND SMART CITY DRIVE? THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER INTERNATIONAL FEARS OF CHINA'S NEW CYBER SECURITY LAW ARE JUSTIFIED. IN PARTS I AND II, THE PAPER ANALYSES WHY CHINA NEEDS A CYBER SECURITY REGIME. IN PARTS III AND IV IT EXAMINES THE LAW ITSELF. (C) 2017 MAX PARASOL. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
91	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON AND WEIGHS THE MAIN BENEFITS AND RISKS OF INTRODUCING AND DEPLOYING TECHNOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS FOR JUSTICE, AS WELL AS THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECT ON FAIRNESS. THE REPLACEMENT WITH AND COMPLEMENTARY USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS IN LIGHT OF THEIR APPLICATION IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE DIGITAL AGE ARE CONSIDERED. THE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT RISKS THAT ARISE FROM THE INTRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY INSTRUMENTS ARE ANALYSED. TAKING AN AXIOLOGICAL APPROACH THAT ASSUMES THE A PRIORI VALUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, JUSTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, WE EVALUATE THE MAIN DANGERS THAT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM ENTAILS. WITH THE HELP OF FORMAL LEGAL AND COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHODS, AS WELL AS THE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF OPEN SOURCES ON THE CAPABILITIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE BIAS OF ALGORITHMS, THE ARTICLE FILLS IN THE GAPS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL OF TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE USE OF ALGORITHMS IN DECISION-MAKING. IT IS NOTED THAT SOME TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE USUAL BEHAVIOUR OF ALL ACTORS IN THE DIGITAL ERA, CHANGE THE NATURE OF INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE QUESTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ALGORITHMIC JUSTICE IS CONSIDERED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF FAIRNESS AND NON-DISCRIMINATION. THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE USE OF ALGORITHMS CAN IMPROVE PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS BUT EMPHASISES A CAREFUL AND BALANCED APPROACH TO OTHER ELEMENTS OF FAIRNESS.
92	THE PRESENT PAPER REVIEWS THE ACTIVITY OF PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF ADVOCATES AS A FACTOR OF TRANSFER FROM LIMITED ACCESS ORDER TO OPEN ACCESS ORDER, IN TERMS OF THE THEORY OF NORTH, WALLIS AND WEINGAST. USING THE ANALYSIS OF THE EXPERIENCE OF ADVOCATES' COLLECTIVE ACTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE PAPER PROPOSES A MODEL EXPLAINING THE PROCESS OF MOBILIZATION OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY FOR COUNTERING THE VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW BY THE RULING ELITE. IT SHOWS THAT COLLECTIVE ACTION OF ADVOCATES PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE EFFICIENCY OF SUCH COLLECTIVE ACTION IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY DEPENDS ON THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF ITS LEGAL ASSOCIATION (IN TERMS OF DONER & SCHNEIDER (2000)) AND ON THE POSITION OF THE PROFESSIONAL ELITE THAT IS HEADING IT. THE ELITE OF THE ADVOCATES' COMMUNITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS CONFRONTED BY A DIFFICULT CHOICE BETWEEN IDENTIFYING ITSELF WITH THE NATIONAL POLITICAL ELITE AND THE NEED TO RESPOND TO THE DEMAND OF GRASS-ROOTS MEMBERS OF THE PROFESSION REGULARLY ENCOUNTERING VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE AUTHORITIES. ON THE EXAMPLE OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES, WE SHOW, HOW THE CHOICE OF PROFESSIONAL ELITE LEADS TO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, AND MAKE CONCLUSIONS FOR THE SITUATION IN RUSSIA.
93	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF EUROPEAN QUALITY STANDARDS OF THE LAW TO PROMOTE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WORK BEGUN IN UKRAINE ON UPDATING THE CIVIL LEGISLATION. THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE PROCESS. SUCH A PROCESS PRIMARILY CONTRIBUTES TO THE ASSERTION OF THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE HUMAN PERSON, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, AND THE PRIORITY OF MAN OVER THE STATE; IMPROVING THE MECHANISMS OF PROTECTION AND PROPER PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, THEIR EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND JUSTICE. THE LATTER ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF COUNTERACTING THE SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH HAS LED THE STATE OF UKRAINE (AS WELL AS OTHER STATES) TO TAKE STEPS TO LIMIT OR REDUCE HUMAN RIGHTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, IS NOT ALWAYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. GENERAL AND SPECIAL METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WERE USED IN THIS STUDY, NAMELY METHODS: ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, FORMAL-LOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONAL, ALONG WITH SOME EMPIRICAL METHODS. THE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY IS THAT THE MATERIALS SUMMARIZED IN THE RESEARCH AND THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE AUTHORS ARE RELEVANT FOR FOREIGN LEGISLATORS, REGARDING BRINGING NATIONAL LEGISLATION TO GLOBAL TRENDS IN PRIVATE LAW AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR) PRACTICE AND OTHER EUROPEAN UNION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE QUALITY OF LAW IN EUROPE, THE AUTHORS MADE SEVERAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE CIVIL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE UPDATE IN ITS SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATION SHOULD CONCERN NOT ONLY THE QUALITY OF NORMS GOVERNING CERTAIN CIVIL (PRIVATE) RELATIONS, BUT ALSO THE QUALITY OF NORMS REGARDING ACTS OF THE CAUSAL INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS, BASED ON THE CASE-LAW OF THE ECHR FOR NATIONAL LEGISLATION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS.
94	RICH ECONOMIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE COINCIDENCE OF, ON THE ONE HAND, HIGH STATE CAPACITY AND, ON THE OTHER, WELL-FUNCTIONING MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEY HAVE STATES THAT ARE POWERFUL AND CENTRALIZED AND YET ALSO LIMITED. FURTHERMORE, RELATIVELY LOW RATES OF SHADOW ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND TAX EVASION SUGGEST THAT CITIZENS PERCEIVE THEIR STATES' LIMITATIONS TO BE CREDIBLE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT A STATE'S ABILITY TO BE CREDIBLY LIMITED MAY FACILITATE ITS INVESTMENTS IN STATE CAPACITY. CONSISTENT WITH THIS, WE EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL LINK BETWEEN HISTORICAL TRADITIONS OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS AND STATE CAPACITY TODAY. WE REPORT THAT MEDIEVAL AND EARLY MODERN REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY EXPERIENCES POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH HIGHER TAX REVENUES, SMALLER SHADOW ECONOMIES, GREATER STATE CONTROL OF VIOLENCE AND YET FEWER STATE RESOURCES DEDICATED TO VIOLENCE. RELATIVE TO TAX REVENUES, THE EVIDENCE REGARDING SHADOW ECONOMIES AND VIOLENCE IS MORE ROBUST TO VARIOUS CONTROLS AND SAMPLES.
95	THE 15-M MOVEMENT AND THE SOCIAL MOVEMENTS THAT BECAME STRONGER THANKS TO 15M (A MOVEMENT AGAINST EVICTIONS, AGAINST LABOR REFORM, AGAINST AUSTERITY AND AGAINST THE CURTAILING OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS) HAVE BEEN A REACTION AGAINST THE NEOLIBERAL MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS WHOSE GENESIS WAS ALSO CAUSED BY NEOLIBERAL PRACTICES. TO FACE THESE CONFLICTS, THE STATE HAS DEVELOPED A POLICE, JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE ARSENAL TO REGULATE AND REPRESS PROTEST. THUS, A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE TERM `DEMOCRACY' AS A GUARANTEE OF SOCIAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES, AS WELL AS THE CLAIM FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT AND CITIZEN PARTICIPATION, HAS BECOME A NEW INTERPRETATIVE FRAMEWORK TO QUESTION THE PERFORMANCE OF THE REPRESSIVE APPARATUS OF THE STATE. THE STUDY OF ANTIREPRESSION IN CATALONIA SHOWS THAT REPRESSION AGAINST PROTEST HAS ALSO SERVED TO MAKE VISIBLE THE LIMITS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IF PROTEST HAS MANAGED TO UNMASK REAL POWER RELATIONS, THE REPRESSION OF PROTEST, IN THE CATALAN CASE, PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN A SOCIAL DEBATE - WHICH HAS ALSO REACHED THE INSTITUTIONS - ON CRIMINAL GUARANTEE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THESE ANTIREPRESSIVE COUNTER HEGEMONIES, ALTHOUGH LIMITED BY A GROWING CRIMINAL STATE, HAVE MEANT A REAL CHALLENGE FOR THE STATE AND ITS CRIMINAL SYSTEM.
96	THIS ESSAY ILLUSTRATES, THROUGH CERTAIN MEASURES TAKEN BY THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT DURING THE COVID19-EPIDEMIC, HOW THE VERY NATURE OF ILLIBERAL REGIMES DETERMINES THEIR WAYS OF DEALING WITH NATIONAL CRISES. HOW AT TIMES THAT CALL FOR UNITY, THEY OPT FOR INCREASING POLARIZATION; HOW INSTEAD OF TRANSPARENCY, THEY CHOOSE TO RESTRICT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; AND HOW THEY USE THE CRISIS TO FURTHER WEAKEN CHECKS AND BALANCES INSTEAD OF REINFORCING PUBLIC TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT BY STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE. THE ESSAY ALSO ARGUES THAT DESPITE THE UNDENIABLE DIFFICULTIES SUCH SITUATIONS POSE TO HUMAN RIGHTS WORK, THEY ALSO PRESENT A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO-MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN BEFORE-RE-EXPLAIN AND RE-PRESENT HUMAN RIGHTS AS A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE TO ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY-MAJORITY AND MINORITY ALIKE. THE EXPERIENCE THAT IN CRISIS SITUATIONS BELONGING TO THE MAINSTREAM MAY NOT PROTECT ONE FROM BECOMING VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED TO ABUSES BY THOSE IN POWER, MAY ENABLE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATES TO BETTER CONVEY THE MESSAGE THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS CRUCIAL TO A WELL-FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY, WHILE AN ILLIBERAL REGIME DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION AGAINST SUCH INSTANCES OF GOVERNMENT OVERREACH.
97	PURPOSE: IN COLOMBIA, THERE IS A RECURRING PROBLEM OF MASS DETENTIONS, AND ARBITRARY PRACTICES AND INAPPROPRIATE USE OF POWER HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY FREQUENT WHEN A CITIZEN IS DEPRIVED OF HIS OR HER LIBERTY. THE SOCIAL STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW IS FOUNDED ON THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE STRUCTURED OR OPERATE BASED ON IGNORANCE OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. METHODOLOGY: DEFINING THE LINES OF JURISPRUDENCE AND THE SCOPE OF PATRIMONIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ACTIONS FOR DIRECT REPARATION IN PROCESSES OF UNJUST DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY IN THE THIRD SECTION OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE ACQUIRES IMPORTANCE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LEGAL SCIENCES. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE CONCEPTUAL CLARITY ON THE CURRENT RECOGNITION OF EXTRA-PATRIMONIAL DAMAGES IN COLOMBIA. FINDINGS: THIS IS CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR THE STATE, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR STATE RESPONSIBILITY, GENERATING A PATRIMONIAL DETRIMENT. CONCLUSIONS: SUBJECTING LEGAL PROCEDURES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW IS THE SAFEST WAY TO AVOID FAILURES OR VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS THAT SUBSEQUENTLY GENERATE THE STATE'S OBLIGATION TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY AND REPAIR DAMAGES BY MEANS OF COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES, WHETHER THESE ARE PATRIMONIAL OR EXTRA-PATRIMONIAL.
98	THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-COUNTRY EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE, MEASURED THROUGH SIX CLUSTERS OF GOVERNANCE DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD BANK, AND THE QUALITY OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, CAPTURED THROUGH THE RANKING ON THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, ALSO ASSESSED BY THE WORLD BANK., THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE INFLUENCE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS USING A CLASSIFICATION OF ECONOMIES OF ALL COUNTRIES WITH POPULATION OF MORE THAN 30,000 CITIZENS, DIVIDED ON INCOME GROUPS SUCH AS LOW INCOME, LOWER MIDDLE INCOME, UPPER MIDDLE INCOME, HIGH INCOME NON-OECD AND HIGH INCOME OECD. THE FINDINGS SHOW THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF SOME GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SUCH AS 'GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS' OR 'REGULATORY QUALITY' ON THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, FOR ALL COUNTRIES, WHILE 'THE RULE OF LAW' AND 'CONTROL OF CORRUPTION' ARE VERY DETERMINING FACTORS FOR THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT ESPECIALLY FOR COUNTRIES CLASSIFIED IN HIGH INCOME CATEGORIES: MOREOVER, THIS PAPER COULD REPRESENT AN ARGUMENT FOR THE RELEVANCE OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY FOR THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, HIGHLIGHTING THE NECESSITY TO PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO ENSURING GOOD GOVEMANCE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES.
99	UNDISPUTED LETTERS OF PAUL AND ACTS OF THE APOSTLES ARE REPLETE WITH DETAILS OF THE GENTILE MISSIONARY'S MULTIPLE IMPRISONMENTS, SO MUCH AS TO QUALIFY HIM A 'JAILBIRD' DESCRIPTION. PAUL'S INCARCERATION IN HEROD'S PALACE FOR 2 YEARS (AC 23:34-35), HIS ARRAIGNMENT BEFORE GOVERNOR FELIX AND SUBSEQUENT DETENTION FOR 5 DAYS BEFORE PLEA (ACTS 24) ON CHARGES OF INCITING PUBLIC VIOLENCE, BEING A RINGLEADER OF A CULTIC FACTION AND CAUSING DISTURBANCES IN THE JERUSALEM TEMPLE, RESONATE WITH THE CONTENTIOUS ARRESTS AND IMPRISONMENT WITHOUT BAIL AND TRIAL OF MEMBERS OF OPPOSITION POLITICAL PARTIES IN ZIMBABWE. CONSISTENT WITH NEW TESTAMENT PASSAGES THAT EXHORT CARING FOR PRISONERS AND THE NEED TO GRANT JUSTICE TO THOSE FACING TRIAL, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW INMATES IN ZIMBABWEAN PRISONS HAVE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN RIGHTS HISTORY BETWEEN 2018 AND 2022. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW THE NEW TESTAMENT CAN BE DEPLOYED TO GRAPPLE WITH DISTRESS CALLS EMERGING FROM ZIMBABWE'S PRISON WALLS AS PART OF ADVOCACY FOR JUDICIAL REFORMS IN THE COUNTRY'S QUEST FOR RULE OF LAW. AT THE END, THE ARTICLE RECOMMENDS WAYS IN WHICH CHURCHES IN ZIMBABWE CAN TAP FROM NEW TESTAMENT PASSAGES HOW TO OPERATE AN EFFECTIVE PRISON MINISTRY IN LIAISON WITH THE PRISONS AND CORRECTIONAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE. THE ARTICLE EMPLOYS QUALITATIVE METHODS OF SOCIO-HISTORICAL AND ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSES TO DISCUSS HOW HUMAN RIGHTS PITFALLS IN PAUL'S IMPRISONMENTS PRESENT REMEDIAL LESSONS IN ZIMBABWE'S QUEST FOR JUDICIAL REFORMS. CONTRIBUTION: DEPLOYMENT OF THE BIBLE TO REDRESS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE. DEMONSTRATION OF HOW EARLY CHRISTIAN LITERATURE CAN DIALOGUE WITH CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN SITZ IM LEBEN FOR SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION.
100	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING ACCORDING TO WHICH UNILATERAL AND EXTRATERRITORIAL SANCTIONS ARE A THREAT TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. IT SHOWS THAT SANCTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AS RESPONSES TO CHALLENGES TO GLOBAL SECURITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE CENTRALISED ACTION BY THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) ENCOUNTERS LIMITATIONS. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS TWO EXAMPLES OF EXTRATERRITORIAL SANCTIONS THAT MAY BE LAWFUL IN THIS SENSE: THOSE EXPANDING ON THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF RESTRICTIVE MEASURES DECIDED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, AND THOSE MAPPING ON CERTAIN MEASURES RECOMMENDED BY THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, COUNTERMEASURES MAY PROVIDE THE LEGAL BASIS TO SUPPORT OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL UNILATERAL AND EVEN EXTRATERRITORIAL MEASURES, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT SUCH MEASURES ACT AS GAP-FILLERS TO ENSURE THE WIDEST POSSIBLE COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITARIAN NORMS AND MAY ULTIMATELY STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
101	DWORKIN'S AND OTHER ANALYTIC/POSITIVIST PHILOSOPHERS' THEORETICAL APPROACH TO LAW LEADS INEXORABLY TO POLITICIZATION, TOTALITARIANISM, LESS JUSTICE, LESS TRUST IN GOVERNMENT, AND LESS TRUTH. A MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH IS FULLER'S, WHICH IS BASED ON EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST. THAT IS ALSO THE APPROACH TRADITIONALLY USED IN THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE USES A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE TWO WESTERN TRADITIONS, THEIR HISTORY, AND THEIR MOST PROMINENT LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS TO EXPLICATE HOW AND WHY DWORKIN'S AND FULLER'S APPROACHES ARE CONSISTENT AND INCONSISTENT WITH THOSE TRADITIONS, FOLLOWED BY A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY PROMINENT INTERNATIONAL NGOS. DWORKIN'S APPROACH, WHICH GROWS OUT OF ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY, IS UNWORKABLE BECAUSE LIKE ALL SCIENTISTIC THEORIES, IT TREATS HUMAN BEINGS MECHANISTICALLY, DE-EMPHASIZING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, IGNORING THE NEED FOR INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE, AND IT ASSUMES AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING, ALL-POWERFUL GOVERNMENT OF EXPERTS TO MAKE LEGAL DECISIONS FOR A COLLECTIVITY. UNDER FULLER'S COMMON LAW APPROACH, THE PROPER ROLE OF LAW IS TO MANAGE CONFLICT, AS IT CANNOT BE PREVENTED AND CANNOT ALWAYS BE RESOLVED, THUS BUILDING THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AS UNBIASED AND APOLITICAL AS POSSIBLE. THIS CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW PLACES LAW ABOVE GOVERNMENT, MINIMIZES POLITICIZATION, INCENTIVIZES PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND IS THE ONLY TRUE COMMON GOOD AMONG MEN.
102	THIS ARTICLE CONCERNS A TOPIC THAT IS NOT NEW, BUT IT REMAINS CURRENT: THE PARTICIPATORY CONSTRUCTION OF THE CRIMINAL DECISION IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE RULED BY LAW. STARTING FROM THE CONCEPTS OF RULE OF LAW, OF GUARANTISM AND OF DEMOCRACY, IT SEEKS TO RENEW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EQUAL AND DIALECTICAL PARTICIPATION OF THE PARTIES, THROUGH THE ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM, FOR THE COMPOSITION OF A FAIR AND LEGITIMATE CRIMINAL JUDICIAL DECISION. IT IS ARGUED, FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, THAT THE PARTIES SHOULD TAKE THE ROLE OF PROTAGONISTS IN THE PROCEDURAL SCENARIO, SINCE THE DECISION SHOULD BE BUILT IN A PARTICIPATORY WAY, I.E., BASED ON THE ARGUMENTS AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED, THUS REDUCING THE GAPS THAT FAVOR JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND DECISIONISM. IT IS PROPOSED, THEREFORE, THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE CONCRETE CASE (ACCEPTANCE OR DISMISSAL OF THE INFORMATION OR INDICTMENT, GRANT OR REJECTION OF A CRIMINAL PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, CONVICTION OR ACQUITTAL) SHOULD BE ELABORATED WITH SUPPORT ON THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE LITIGANTS, FROM THE CONTRAST OF THEIR ARGUMENTS AND OF THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED, IN ADVERSARIAL PROCEEDINGS, IN THE REGULAR COURSE OF THE PROCESS.
103	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE VIOLATION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. THE RIGHT TO AN INDEPENDENT COURT IS NOT ONLY A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE IN THE RULE OF LAW (ARTICLE 2 TEU, ARTICLE 19(1)), BUT ALSO ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ARTICLE 47 CFR). JEOPARDISING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ONE OF THE EU COUNTRIES SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS. LEAVING THE STANDARD OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY RESULTING FROM THE ECHR JURISPRUDENCE, THE ARTICLE SUMMARISES THE CURRENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CJEU CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE IMPARTIALITY OF JUDGES AT TWO LEVELS: GENERAL (OR SYSTEMIC), AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPERATION OF THE EAW. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES PRESENT SITUATION IN POLAND AND RECENT JUDGMENTS OF THE CJEU IN "POLISH CASES" - ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF EXECUTING THE EAW AND EVALUATING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM IN POLAND.
104	THE PAPER EXAMINES POSSIBLE EU ENLARGEMENT IN WESTERN BALKANS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW CORRUPTION. ABSTRACT TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL WARNS FROM THE RISKS OF ACCELERATION AND SPREADING OF CORRUPTION IN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION BETWEEN STATES WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTEGRITY, AND DRAWS AMBITIOUS GUIDELINES FOR OPTIMAL ANTICORRUPTION POLICY. THE PAPER AIMS FOR POLICY ADVICES CONCERNING PROPER ANTICORRUPTION POLICY. THE METHOD IS, FIRST, TO COMPARE THE CANDIDATE STATES TO THE CURRENT 28 EU STATES IN TERMS OF CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. SECOND, THE PAPER SURVEYS RELEVANT ECONOMIC LITERATURE ON THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION, WHICH SHOWS THAT IN COUNTRIES, THAT ARE IMPRINTED BY BOTH CORRUPTION AND BAD GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, A STRAIGHTFORWARD ATTACK ON CORRUPTION IS HOPELESS, AND IT MAY EVEN BE ECONOMICALLY DETRIMENTAL. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT FOLLOWING THE GUIDELINES GIVEN BY TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL IS A TOO WINDING PATH TO TAKE, AND IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SET INTEGRITY AS A PRECONDITION FOR ENTRY. OPTIMAL POLICY TO AVOID THE CONTAGION OF CORRUPTION IS TO FOCUS NOT ON THE CANDIDATES, BUT ON THE EXISTING EU28, AND PARTICULARLY ON CLOSE NEIGHBORS OF THE CANDIDATES. THIS CAN BE DONE BEST BY CONCENTRATING ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, NAMELY BY STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE OECD ANTICORRUPTION CONVENTION. THE EU SHOULD PRESSURE ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES TO UNIFORM COMMITMENT TO THAT PROJECT. AFTER THE ENTRANCE, THE ROOTING OUT OF CORRUPTION AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF FORMAL GOVERNANCE IN THE NEW MEMBER STATES CAN THEN BE CARRIED OUT IN DUE COURSE.
105	TAX LAW HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE A DATA-CENTRIC DISCIPLINE THROUGH THE YEARS. THE STRUGGLE AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TAX AVOIDANCE AND EVASION HAS PUSHED THE EUROPEAN UNION TO PASS A NUMBER OF DIRECTIVES REGULATING THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND THE TAXPAYERS' DUTY TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION AND DATA CONCERNING THEIR BUSINESS AND INVESTMENTS.THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS DAC6 (DIRECTIVE ON ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION, COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2018/822) A QUALITATIVE CHANGE IN THIS SCENARIO, AS IT APPEARS TO ERODE THE CLIENT-ATTORNEY PRIVILEGE. IT IMPOSES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, A DUTY OF TRANSPARENCY TO INTERMEDIARIES SUCH AS CONSULTANTS AND (POTENTIALLY) LAWYERS WHICH IS IN COLLISION WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, EVENTUALLY CASTING A SHADOW ON THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE AND (INDIRECTLY) THE RULE OF LAW. THE CENTRAL PART OF THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EXTENSION OF THE PRIVILEGE IN TAX LAW, TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO CURB TAX AVOIDANCE AND TO PRESERVE THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. THE FINDINGS ARE THAT THE CLIENT-ATTORNEY RELATIONSHIP IS ONE OF THE PILLARS THE RULE OF LAW IS BUILT ON, IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED IN THE FIELD OF TAXATION TOO AND EVENTUALLY THAT NO DIRECTIVE OR REGULATION HAVE THE POWER TO WAIVE IT.THE CONCLUSION IS THAT DAC6 IS TO BE CONSIDERED A STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION BY THE EUROPEAN LEGISLATOR AS THE FIRST RULING OF THE CJEU (COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION) SEEMS TO CONFIRM.
106	STEPPING UP LEGISLATION IN THE FOREIGN-RELATED FIELD IS A FOUNDATION AND PREREQUISITE FOR ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS IN A COORDINATED MANNER. IT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT LINK IN THE PROMOTION OF THE SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM WITH THE CONSTITUTION AS THE CORE, AS PROPOSED IN THE REPORT TO THE 20TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC). SINCE CHINA INTRODUCED THE REFORM AND OPENING-UP POLICY IN 1978, CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE FOREIGN-RELATED FIELD HAS EVOLVED FROM INITIAL FORMULATION TO MATURE FRAMEWORK, AND CHINA'S LEGISLATION IN THE FOREIGN-RELATED FIELD HAS MAINTAINED DISTINCT CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS AND CONTEMPORARY FEATURES. CURRENTLY, CHINA'S LEGISLATION IN THE FOREIGN- RELATED FIELD FOCUSES ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND ON HIGH-LEVEL OPENING- UP. IT CONTINUOUSLY STRENGTHENS THE CONNECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS WITH THAT IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, AND CONSISTENTLY PROMOTES THE CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM OF EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION. FURTHERMORE, LEGISLATION IN THE FOREIGN-RELATED FIELD IN CHINA STILL HAS ISSUES TO ADDRESS, WHICH INCLUDE THE INCONCLUSIVE STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, A RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE DOMESTIC APPROACH IN EXERCISING EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION, AND A LIMITED SCOPE OF LEGAL LIABILITY. TO BETTER RESPOND TO THE NEED OF LEGISLATION IN BUILDING A HUMAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE AND TO ENHANCE CHINA'S RIGHT TO INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DISCOURSE IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, CHINA NEEDS TO MOVE FASTER TO INTRODUCE THE LAW ON FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THIS LAW SHOULD REFLECT THE BASIC POSITIONS, PRINCIPLES, AND POLICIES THAT CHINA UPHOLDS IN MATTERS OF FOREIGN RELATIONS, AS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT TO THE 20TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS. FURTHERMORE, CHINA SHOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE LEGISLATION IN KEY AREAS OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND INCREASE THE PREEXISTING PUNITIVE MEASURES FOR RESPONDING TO ACTIONS THAT HARM NATIONAL SECURITY BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. LEGISLATION SHOULD ALSO BE STRENGTHENED TO COUNTER SANCTIONS AND INTERFERENCE, AND SUPPORTING MEASURES SHOULD BE ADOPTED TO ENSURE THE EFFECT OF RELEVANT LEGISLATION. IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC AND TRADE RELATIONS, CHINA SHOULD INCORPORATE HIGH-STANDARD INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE RULES IN RELEVANT LEGISLATIONS, AND SHOULD LEGALIZE THE REPLICABLE AND PROMOTABLE LEGAL RULES IN THE BUILDING OF FREE TRADE ZONES. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXISTING JURISDICTIONAL SYSTEM AND INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION SYSTEM SHOULD BE PROMOTED.
107	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIX DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF POLITICAL RISK IN A COUNTRY AND ITS SPREAD FOR A SAMPLE OF 12 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE METHODOLOGY APPLIED CONSISTS OF PANEL ESTIMATORS WITH FIXED EFFECTS. IN ADDITION, A PANEL DATA MODEL WITH INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES IS CONSIDERED TO TACKLE WITH POTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF ENDOGENEITY IN THE MODEL. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THERE IS A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL RISK AND SOVEREIGN SPREAD IN LATIN AMERICA, I.E., GREATER POLITICAL RISK IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER SOVEREIGN SPREAD. THIS EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN THE POLITICAL RISK IS ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW OR LOW-QUALITY REGULATION IN THE COUNTRY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE MAIN LIMITATION OF THIS STUDY CONCERNS THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF ENDOGENEITY WHICH MIGHT EXIST BETWEEN SOVEREIGN RISK AND POLITICAL RISK MEASURES, WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED WITH THE ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY USED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE OF SOVEREIGN RISK BY STUDYING THE DIMENSION OF POLITICAL RISK IN DETAIL. SPECIFICALLY, SIX DIMENSIONS OF POLITICAL RISK ARE STUDIED. ADDITIONALLY, IT PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS PERIOD, REGARDING THE DETERMINANTS OF SPREADS ON LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIES.
108	THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE EU AS A NORMATIVE POWER HAS BECOME A CENTRAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IN THE FIELD OF EUROPEAN STUDIES. THIS CONCEPT HIGHLIGHTS THE EU'S ROLE IN THE PROMOTION OF NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES, PARTICULARLY THOSE CONCERNING ITS CORE VALUES AS LAID OUT IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE LISBON TREATY: HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF ACADEMIC WORKS ON NPE HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE EU'S EXTERNAL ACTION, THERE IS A GROWING TREND TO APPLY THIS CONCEPT TO THE STUDY OF MEMBER STATES THAT CHALLENGE THE CORE VALUES OF THE EU. THIS PAPER TAKES A STEP FURTHER IN THAT ENDEAVOR THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF SPANISH MEDIA DISCOURSES ON THE EU, AND THEIR ROLE IN THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EU AS A NORMATIVE POWER, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. SPECIFICALLY, OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON HOW THE EU'S COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE REFLECTED IN DOMINANT MEDIA DISCOURSES ON THE EU IN SPANISH MEDIA. TO CONDUCT OUR STUDY, SIX NATIONAL SPANISH MEDIA OUTLETS WERE SELECTED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: OWNERSHIP; IDEOLOGY; CONSUMPTION; AND IMPACT. A FINAL SAMPLE OF 540 NEWS ITEMS PUBLISHED BETWEEN JULY 2021 AND MARCH 2022 WERE SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS. USING A QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH THAT INCLUDES CONTENT ANALYSIS AND CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS, WE ANALYZED THE MAJOR DISCOURSES IDENTIFIED IN RELATION TO THE EU, FOCUSING ON THOSE IN WHICH THE CONSTRUCTION (OR DECONSTRUCTION) OF THE EU AS A NORMATIVE POWER IS MORE PREVALENT. WE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO UNFOLD HOW THIS CONSTRUCTION IS PROJECTED INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY.
109	THIS PAPER TRACES THE EVOLUTION IN THINKING AMONG SCHOLARS AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE POSTWAR PERIOD, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RISE AND FALL OF UNIVERSAL THEMES OF DEVELOPMENT. FOR MUCH OF THIS PERIOD, UNIVERSAL THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT PREVAILED, BEGINNING WITH VARIOUS VERSIONS OF MODERNIZATION, STATE-LED THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT PREVAILED IN THE FIRST THREE POST-WAR DECADES AND THAT OFTEN YIELDED DISAPPOINTING OUTCOMES. THESE WERE SUPPLANTED BY IN MANY RESPECTS THE CONVERSE POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS: NEO-LIBERAL ('WASHINGTON CONSENSUS') POLICIES THAT EMPHASIZED THE ROLE OF MARKETS AND THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THESE POLICIES ALSO OFTEN YIELDED DISAPPOINTING OUTCOMES. THIS PERSPECTIVE IN TURN WAS LARGELY DISPLACED IN THE 1990S BY AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE AND QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS A MAJOR DETERMINANT OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS BUT, LIKE PRIOR UNIVERSAL THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT, CAME TO RECOGNIZE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE MIXED TO POOR RECORD OF DONOR-SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THAT THERE IS NO GENERAL BLUEPRINT FOR THE DESIGN OF POLITICAL, BUREAUCRATIC, AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE PAPER GOES ON TO ARGUE THAT WHILE REJECTION OF UNIVERSAL THEORIES OF DEVELOPMENT IS GENERALLY TO BE WELCOMED, THERE ARE DANGERS IN SUCCUMBING TO AN EXTREME FORM OF RELATIVISM WHERE EACH COUNTRY 'MUST WRITE ITS OWN HISTORY.' THESE DANGERS ARE ILLUSTRATED BY REFERENCE TO THE EVOLVING AND SOMETIMES INCONSISTENT VIEWS OF TWO PROMINENT LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARS - DAVID TRUBEK AND BRIAN TAMANAHA - WITH RESPECT TO THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPMENT.
110	MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IS ESSENTIAL TO OVERCOMING POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATION SHORTFALLS JEOPARDIZING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. BESIDES IMPROVING OUR ECOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WILDLIFE, REMOTE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ALSO ALLOW US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE TO USE WILDLIFE AS SENTINELS OF COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.WE ILLUSTRATE THIS SENTINEL POTENTIAL OF WILDLIFE USING GPS TRACKING OF LARGE SCAVENGERS WITH COMPLEMENTARY FUNCTIONAL TRAITS (I.E. 21 GRIFFON VULTURES AND 13 WOLVES) TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH EU SANITARY REGULATIONS ALLOWING LIVESTOCK CARCASS DISPOSAL IN THE FIELD.WILDLIFE SENTINELS ALLOWED THE SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF 489 LIVESTOCK CARCASSES LEFT IN THE FIELD, WHICH REVEALED AN IMPORTANT MISMATCH BETWEEN ON-PAPER AND IN-REALITY IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REGULATIONS. WHILE <45% OF THE CARCASSES WERE PLACED IN AUTHORIZED AREAS, COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE CRITERIA REQUIRED BY THE REGULATIONS ON LIVESTOCK CARCASS DISPOSAL (E.G. FROM CARCASS CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SPECIES, AGE OR PRODUCTION SYSTEM TO ITS LOCATION FAR AWAY FROM WATER, BUILDINGS OR ROADS) RANGED FROM 0% TO 4.2%, WITH NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGIONS WITH UNEVEN IMPLEMENTATION.MAJOR GAPS IN COMPLIANCE POINTED TOWARDS INSUFFICIENT AND OVER-BUREAUCRATIZED DESIGNATION OF SCAVENGER FEEDING ZONES, WHERE LIVESTOCK CARCASS DISPOSAL IS AUTHORIZED. THE INDISCRIMINATE NATURE OF DISTANCE CRITERIA FROM CARCASSES TO WATERCOURSES, BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE FURTHER AFFECTED COMPLIANCE.SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. GPS-TAGGED SCAVENGERS ALLOW THE ON-GROUND MONITORING OF CARCASSES, THE ADDRESSING OF POTENTIAL RISKS FOR WILDLIFE, LIVESTOCK AND HUMAN HEALTH, THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND WOULD IMPROVE ESTIMATES OF CARCASS AVAILABILITY, SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTING TO MORE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATION ENFORCEMENT. OUR RESULTS SHOW THE HUGE POTENTIAL OF GPS-TAGGED WILDLIFE AS SENTINELS FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE TO ENHANCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW.
111	LEGAL CERTAINTY IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE FOR INDIVIDUALS' AUTONOMY, AS LACK OF CERTAINTY PREVENTS THE PLANNING OF FUTURE ACTIVITIES AND MAKING RATIONAL DECISIONS. AS OTHER KEY LEGAL PRINCIPLES, IT COMPRISES AN AXIOLOGICAL QUALITY WHICH INFLUENCES THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL RULES AND THE APPLICATION OF STATUTORY LAWS. THUS, IT SHOULD BE ADHERED TO BY ALL BRANCHES OF STATE POWER. ITS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROMOTE SEVERAL VALUES THAT ARE ALL IMPORTANT FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS: THE RULE OF LAW, PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS, GENERAL TRUST IN LAW, PREVENTION OF ARBITRARY DECISION-MAKING, INADMISSIBILITY OF RETROACTIVITY. HOWEVER, IN SOME LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. THESE DIFFERENCES ALSO INFLUENCE THE EXTENT AND LIMITS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AS IT MAY NOT MEAN TOTAL RIGIDITY AND PREVENT NECESSARY CHANGES IN STATUTORY LAWS AND DECISION-MAKING. THE REASONABLE BALANCE IS INFLUENCED BY ITS AXIOLOGICAL CONTENT. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE INTERPRETATION PRACTICE OF THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITH THE AIM TO DETERMINE THE PARTIAL VALUES INHERENT TO THE PRINCIPLE AND CATEGORISE THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR IMPORTANCE. SEVERAL PARTIAL OBJECTIVES WERE DETERMINED BY QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE KEY PARTIAL OBJECTIVES INCLUDE PROTECTION OF THE VALUES COMPRISING A GENERAL TRUST IN THE LAW, INDIVIDUALS' LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS, AND A CERTAIN DEGREE OF PREDICTABILITY OF LAWS, ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE AND COURTS' DECISIONS (UNIFORMITY, TRANSPARENCY, INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND STABILITY). HAVING IDENTIFIED THESE VALUES, FURTHER RESEARCH MAY BE CONDUCTED AS TO HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE UPHELD.
112	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY'S (CMA) PROPOSALS TO LOWER THE STANDARD OF REVIEW OF CERTAIN ANTITRUST DECISIONS IN THE COMPETITION APPEAL TRIBUNAL (CAT) FROM A MERITS APPEAL TO JUDICIAL REVIEW PRINCIPLES OR SOME OTHER LIMITED BASIS, WHILE RETAINING THE CAT'S 'FULL JURISDICTION' OVER FINES, AND TO AMEND THE CAT'S RULES OF PROCEDURE TO RESTRICT THE ADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE ON APPEAL AND THE USE OF ORAL TESTIMONY. THE ARGUMENT DEVELOPED IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT SUCH PROPOSALS ARE: (I) IN CONFLICT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW; (II) INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998 (HRA98); (III) A STEP BACK EVEN FROM THE OFTEN CRITICIZED STANDARD OF REVIEW APPLIED BY THE UNION COURTS IN RESPECT OF EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S DECISIONS; (IV) INAPPROPRIATE AS A MATTER OF POLICY. IF THE CURRENT REGIME NEEDS IMPROVING TO REDUCE THE COST AND LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS, THEN THREE OPTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED: (I) MOVING FROM A MERITS APPEAL TO A MERITS REVIEW (OPTION 1); (II) STRENGTHENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE DECISION-MAKING PANEL WITHIN THE CMA (OPTION 2), WHILE LOWERING THE STANDARD OF REVIEW TO JUDICIAL REVIEW PRINCIPLES; (III) ESTABLISHING A PROSECUTORIAL MODEL (OPTION 3). OPTION 3 IS THE MOST RADICAL BUT SHOULD BE GIVEN SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AS IT IS LIKELY TO BE THE BEST SUITED TO ACHIEVING THE POLICY OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING THE COST AND LENGTH OF COMPETITION PROCEEDINGS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RETAINING RIGOROUS SCRUTINY OF THE FACTS AND ECONOMIC EVIDENCE, WHICH IS KEY TO ENSURING NOT ONLY THE FAIRNESS, AND THEREFORE THE LEGITIMACY, OF THE SYSTEM, BUT ALSO ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
113	SINCE 2015, POLAND HAS EXPERIENCED A BACKSLIDING IN DEMOCRATIC AND RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. THE RULING PARTY, "LAW AND JUSTICE," HAS ADOPTED A SERIES OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AFFECTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF COURTS AND CHECKS AND BALANCES MECHANISMS. SOME REFORMS WERE COPIED FROM HUNGARY, WHICH, AS THE FIRST MEMBER STATE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, STARTED THE WAY TOWARD ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN CONTEMPORARY EUROPE. DESPITE PRESSURE FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE PROCESS OF CHANGES IN POLAND DID NOT STOP. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT METHODS IMPLEMENTED TO DISMANTLING DEMOCRACY, AS THEY CAN BE USED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER ALSO ANALYZES DIFFERENT FORMS OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL RESISTANCE TOWARD NON-DEMOCRATIC CHANGES, INCLUDING THE SPECIAL ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND LAWYERS, AS WELL AS MONITORING AND JUDICIAL MECHANISMS USED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION.
114	INTER-COMMUNAL AND INSURGENT VIOLENCE HAS BEEN ENTRENCHED IN NORTHEAST INDIA FOR DECADES. AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, ATTACKS AGAINST CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FORCES ARE IN ABEYANCE. THIS DOWNTURN REFLECTS THE CONSOLIDATION OF LOCAL REGIMES OF CORRUPTION AND REPRESSION. NEW DELHI TOLERATES AND EVEN SUPPORTS SUCH LOCALIZED AUTOCRACY AS A MEANS TO MANAGE SECURITY THREATS.
115	HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES ARE PRESENT TODAY IN ALMOST EVERY AREA OF SOCIETY AND, ACCORDINGLY, OCCUPY A SPECIAL PLACE IN IT. DUE TO THE FACT THAT MODERN UKRAINE IS IN A TRANSITIONAL STATE OF CREATING LEGAL, STATE AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, THE PROCESS OF FORMATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE NATURE OF LEGAL RELATIONS IN A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. AFTER ALL, RELATIONS IN CIVIL SOCIETY SHOULD BE FORMED ON THE BASIS OF AWARENESS OF THE INALIENABILITY AND NON-REPUDIATION OF NATURAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY SHOULD BE BASED ON THE POSITIVE LEGISLATION OF THE STATE. THEY ARE THE KEY TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. ENSURING HUMAN RIGHTS IS THE CRITERION BY WHICH THE ACHIEVED LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IN THE STATE IS ASSESSED. THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS CAN BE CALLED CONSOLIDATION IN THE BASIC LAW OF THE PROVISION THAT A PERSON, HIS LIFE AND HEALTH, HONOR AND DIGNITY, INTEGRITY AND SECURITY ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE HIGHEST SOCIAL VALUE, AND DETERMINING THE PRIORITY OF UNIVERSAL VALUES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT, IN FACT, DIRECTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN LAW, IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN GENERAL LEGAL STANDARDS THAT ALLOW US TO MOVE ON TO A NEW QUALITATIVE COEXISTENCE OF NATIONS IN THE MODERN WORLD ON SUBSTANTIAL HUMANISTIC PRINCIPLES. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING THE ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS AND SPECIFICS OF PROTECTING EVERYDAY HUMAN RIGHTS, THE ARTICLE EXAMINED THE NEW HUMAN RIGHTS THAT EXIST IN POST-MODERN SOCIETY, WHICH TODAY ARE CALLED THE RIGHTS OF THE "FOURTH GENERATION".
116	IN THIS ESSAY WE REVIEW PHENOMENA ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESS OF RUPTURE WITH THE ONE-PARTY REGIME (INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUCIONARY PARTY) THAT GOVERNED IN MEXICO, BETWEEN 1929 AND 2000, A YEAR THAT OPENED THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, BUT THAT IN TURN CONTRIBUTED TO THE FRACTURE OF THE SIX LARGE AND HISTORIC DRUG CARTELS. THE RISE TO POWER OF NEW POLITICAL FORCES IN THE COUNTRY BECAME THE BREAKDOWN OF TRADITIONAL CORRUPTION PACTS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE EMERGENCE OF SMALL CRIMINAL ASSOCIATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL POWER STRUCTURES IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHY, INAUGURATING FORMS OF EXTREME VIOLENCE AND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FORCED DISPLACEMENT OF POPULATION AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF PEOPLE. THE ATOMIZATION OF THE BIG CARTELS LED TO THE EMERGENCE OF UNPRECEDENTED SOCIAL, BOTH RURAL AND URBAN, LOCATED IN A SCENARIO THAT SUSANA ROTKER NAMED CITIZENSHIPS OF FEAR. THE EXPRESSION SYNTHESIZES THE CRACKING OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC MODEL, THE ARENDTIAN CLOSURE OF "THE RIGHT TO HAVE RIGHTS", TYPICAL OF AN OPEN SOCIETY.
117	STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN WOMEN ACHIEVING SOME DEGREE OF ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE THROUGH EMPOWERMENT AND A DECLINE IN GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV). HOWEVER, INADEQUATE FUNDING HAS BEEN A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, WHILE FOREIGN AID HAS BEEN SEEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE. FOREIGN AID FOR PROMOTING WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GENDER EQUALITY IS IMPROVING IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. YET, ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL STATISTICS, THE FREQUENCY OF GBV IN AFRICA IS AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. GIVEN THIS, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF WOMEN'S AID AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FACTORS THAT CAN REDUCE GBV USING BOTH CROSS-SECTIONAL AUTOREGRESSIVE LAGS TO INVESTIGATE SHORT- AND LONG-RUN IMPLICATIONS AND THE PANEL VECTOR CORRECTION MODEL TO EXAMINE THE SHOCK EFFECT OF AID ON OTHER VARIABLES. ALSO, THE MEDIATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND WOMEN'S AID ARE CONSIDERED. THE METRICS USED FOR THE FACTORS THAT REDUCE GBV ARE FEMALE CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL, THE SECONDARY SCHOOL GENDER PARITY INDEX, THE GENITAL MUTILATION PREVALENCE RATE, AND THE METRICS FOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ARE THE RULES OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. THE IMPLICATIONS FROM THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT ENHANCING THE LEGAL STRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN AFRICA, GIVEN THE LOW COEFFICIENT VALUES TO REDUCE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION; MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO INCREASE THE ENROLMENT OF FEMALE STUDENTS THROUGH THE MAXIMISATION OF WOMEN'S AID IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF REDUCING GENDER VIOLENCE. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY AIDS IN THE REDUCTION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN; GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS INSIGNIFICANT. ALSO, THEY SHOW THAT WOMEN'S AID ALSO REDUCES FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION, ALBEIT AT A LOW RATE. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY CALL FOR STRONG ENHANCED GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND FUNDING TO END THE PRACTICE OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FEMALE EDUCATION IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN.
118	IN 2009, NICARAGUA EXPERIENCED THE INTENSIFICATION OF THREE TENDENCIES THAT HAVE DEFINED THE COUNTRY'S POLITICS SINCE THE FRENTE SANDINISTA DE LIBERACION NACIONAL (FSLN), LED BY DANIEL ORTEGA, RETURNED TO POWER IN JANUARY OF 2007. THESE TENDENCIES ARE: THE EROSION OF THE FRAGILE DEMOCRACY THAT EMERGED AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY THE FSLN IN THE 1980S; THE FRAGMENTATION AND POLARIZATION OF NICARAGUAN SOCIETY; AND, THE COUNTRY'S INCREASING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEPENDENCY ON THE GOVERNMENT OF HUGO CHAVEZ AND THE REGIONAL INTEGRATION PROJECT KNOWN AS ALTERNATIVA BOLIVARIANA YARN INS AMERICAS (ALBA). THESE THREE TENDENCIES SHARE A COMMON ROOT: DANIEL ORTEGA'S ASSUMPTION THAT THE ELECTORAL VICTORY OF THE FSLN IN NOVEMBER OF 2006 REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING A SECOND PHASE OF THE SANDINISTA REVOLUTION THAT CAPTURED POWER IN 1979 AND THAT CAME TO AN END WITH THE ELECTORAL DEFEAT OF THE FSLN IN 1990.
119	THERE HAS BEEN A LONG-RUNNING DEBATE OVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME AND HAPPINESS. THE EASTERLIN PARADOX AND THE PARADOX OF UNHAPPY GROWTH ARE BOTH DISCUSSED AT LENGTH IN THE LITERATURE. THE TRADITIONAL REDUCED FORM REGRESSION MODEL, HOWEVER, LIMITS THE STRUCTURE OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT CAN BE ESTIMATED. THIS LIMITATION IS THE MOTIVATION FOR AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH THAT CAN UNCOVER MORE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELL-BEING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY USES PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS TO REVEAL THE UNOBSERVED LATENT VARIABLES THAT GOVERN THE CO-MOVEMENT OF SEVERAL WELL-BEING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES. TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS ARE FOUND: THE FIRST HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON ALL OF THE VARIABLES, WHEREAS THE SECOND HAS OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON WELL-BEING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AUXILIARY REGRESSIONS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRST COMPONENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW AND THE SECOND IS CORRELATED WITH FREEDOM FROM REGULATION.
120	CHINA HAS ENACTED A NUMBER OF COMPANY LAW STATUTES SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THESE DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CORPORATE FORM AS A VEHICLE FOR BUSINESS ACTIVITY. IN THE 1993 AND 2005 COMPANY LAWS, AND IN NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS TO THESE LAWS, CHINESE LEGISLATORS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN WELL ATTUNED TO MODERN CORPORATE LAW IDEAS AND CONCEPTS. NEVERTHELESS, THESE COMPANY LAWS REFLECT SOME IMPORTANT CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS THE DOMINANT ROLE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND OF THE IMPACT OF THE STATE IN CHINESE COMPANIES. CHINESE COMPANY LAW HAS CLEARLY EVOLVED IN THE SHADOW OF A STRONG AUTHORITARIAN STATE. THIS HAS INFLUENCED THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES KEY ISSUES REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPANY LAW IN CHINA SINCE 1993 AND SUGGESTS THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN APPRECIATION OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS UPON THE EFFECT OF COMPANY LAW UPON CHINESE COMPANIES.
121	IN ITS RECENT JUDGMENTS IN RUMSFELD V PADILLA, HAMDI V RUMSFELD AND RASUL V BUSH, THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES REJECTED THE EXECUTIVE'S CLAIM THAT IT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST CONNECTIONS WITHOUT ANY JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, NEVERTHELESS, THE SUGGESTION THAT THESE DECISIONS CONSTITUTE A MAJOR SETBACK FOR THE US ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE LEGAL PARAMETERS OF THE 'WAR ON TERROR' IS MISLEADING. FOR THE COURT HAS UPHELD, IN PRINCIPLE, THE GOVERNMENT'S POWER TO DESIGNATE TERRORIST SUSPECTS AS 'ENEMY COMBATANTS' AND TO HOLD THEM WITHOUT CHARGING THEM WITH A CRIMINAL OFFENCE OR ACCORDING THEM PRISONER-OF-WAR STATUS UNDER THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS. AND IT IS EXACTLY THIS CREATION OF A SPECIAL CATEGORY OF DETAINEES, NOT ENVISAGED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW, THAT UNDERLIES THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE GOVERNMENT'S TREATMENT OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROCEDURAL RULES SUGGESTED BY THE SUPREME COURT FOR THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ` ENEMY COMBATANT' DETENTIONS ARE SO DEFERENTIAL TO THE EXECUTIVE THAT THEY COULD RENDER THE REVIEW ALL BUT MEANINGLESS. MOREOVER, SEVERAL CONTROVERSIAL ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S POST-SEPTEMBER 11 DETENTION POLICIES ARE NOT ADDRESSED BY THE DECISIONS AT ALL. THE SUPREME COURT, IT IS ARGUED, HAS MISSED THE CHANCE TO IMPOSE ON THE EXECUTIVE A CLEAR FRAMEWORK, BASED ON STANDARDS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, GOVERNING THE DETENTION OF ALLEGED TERRORISTS.
122	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR PRESENTS THIRTEEN THESES ON THE IMPACT THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS AND CAN HAVE ON A SOCIAL AND LEGAL LEVEL. STARTING WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE CHARACTERS OF CYBERSOCIETY, HE CONSIDERS THE POTENTIALITIES AND RISKS OF THE FUTURE USE OF AI, DEALING WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND BALANCES OF POWERS.
123	TAX AUTHORITIES BOTH IN AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED STATES ASPIRE TO TREAT TAXPAYERS FAIRLY. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE ASPIRATIONS HAVE BEEN RECOGNISED IN FORMAL LEGAL RULES IN BOTH JURISDICTIONS. IT SHOWS THAT THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS ENACTED A NUMBER OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE FAIR TREATMENT OF TAXPAYERS AND PROVIDE FORMAL SANCTIONS AGAINST THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR FAILURES TO TREAT TAXPAYERS FAIRLY. IN CONTRAST, IN AUSTRALIA, THE TAX OFFICE'S COMMITMENT TO TREAT TAXPAYERS FAIRLY REMAINS LITTLE MORE THAN AN ASPIRATION OR MORAL DUTY. THERE HAS BEEN MINIMAL RECOGNITION BY EITHER THE JUDICIARY OR THE LEGISLATURE OF ANY LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE TAXPAYER RIGHT TO FAIR TREATMENT. FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO JURISDICTIONS, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF LESSONS FOR AUSTRALIA FROM THE UNITED STATES' APPROACH TO PROVIDING TAXPAYERS WITH LEGAL RIGHTS TO FAIR TREATMENT.
124	LEGAL SCHOLARS' INTEREST IN SHAKESPEARE HAS OFTEN FOCUSED ON CONVENTIONAL LEGAL RULES AND PROCEDURES, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE OR MEASURE FOR MEASURE. THOSE PLAYS CERTAINLY REVEAL SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE, BUT WITHIN STABLE, PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES, WHICH ENJOY A GENERALLY WELL-FUNCTIONING LEGAL ORDER. IN CONTRAST, SHAKESPEARE'S FIRST HISTORICAL TETRALOGY EXPLORES THE CONDITIONS FOR THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF A LEGAL SYSTEM, IN TERMS NOT UNLIKE THOSE DESCRIBED BY HOBBES A HALF-CENTURY LATER. THE FIRST TETRALOGY'S DEEPLY COLLAPSED, QUASI-ANARCHIC SOCIETY LACKS ANY FUNCTIONING LEGAL REGIME. ITS POWER POLITICS ARE NOT, AS IN MANY OF SHAKESPEARE'S OTHER PLAYS, MERELY LATENT, LURKING BENEATH THE PATINA OF AN OTHERWISE FUNCTIONING LEGAL ORDER. THEY PERVADE ALL OF SOCIETY. DISSENTING FROM A LONG CRITICAL TRADITION, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE FIGURE OF HENRY VI DOES NOT MERELY REPRESENT ANTIQUATED MEDIEVALISM OR INEPT RULE. THROUGH HENRY'S CONSTANT RECOURSE TO LEGAL PROCESS, ARBITRATION AND ANTI-MILITARISM, THE FIRST TETRALOGY GOES BEYOND QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO ESTABLISH A FUNCTIONING LEGAL ORDER. IT EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY, AND MEANING, OF A JUST ONE.
125	OVER THE PAST DECADE, THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS DEPRIVED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF BRITISH SUBJECTS OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP. THIS POLICY, KNOWN AS DENATURALIZATION, HAS BEEN APPLIED WITH PARTICULAR HARSHNESS IN CASES WHERE FOREIGN-BORN SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IS PART OF A GLOBAL TREND. IN RECENT YEARS, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE EITHER DEBATED OR ENACTED DENATURALIZATION STATUTES. BUT BRITAIN REMAINS AN OUTLIER AMONG WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. SINCE 2006, THE UNITED KINGDOM HOME SECRETARY HAS REVOKED THE CITIZENSHIP OF AT LEAST 373 BRITONS, OF WHOM AT LEAST 53 HAVE HAD ALLEGED LINKS TO TERRORISM. THIS IS MORE THAN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF REVOCATIONS BY CANADA, FRANCE, AUSTRALIA, AND NETHERLANDS COMBINED. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE TROUBLING, AS THE RIGHT TO BE SECURE IN ONE'S CITIZENSHIP HAS BEEN A CORNERSTONE OF THE POSTWAR EUROPEAN LIBERAL POLITICAL ORDER, AND OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS.
126	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EVALUATE CRITICALLY THE EVOLUTION OF THE PREVENTIVE PARADIGM OF SECURITY LAW BY FOCUSING ON THE CRIMINALISATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF MOBILITY WHICH HAS BEEN LABELLED AS 'TERRORIST TRAVEL.' THE ARTICLE WILL HIGHLIGHT THE IMPACT OF THE POLITICAL IMPERATIVE OF TACKLING THE PHENOMENON OF 'FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS' ON THE EMERGENCE OF A GLOBAL PREVENTIVE PARADIGM OF CRIMINALISATION OF TRAVEL. THE ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PREVENTIVE PARADIGM OF CRIMINALISATION OF TRAVEL IN EU LAW, AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE OF COUNTER-TERRORISM AS RENEWED BY THE FIGHT AGAINST 'FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS.' THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON THE EMERGENCE OF A MULTI-LEVEL PARADIGM OF CRIMINALISATION OF 'TERRORIST TRAVEL', WHILE THE SECOND PART WILL FOCUS ON THE SURVEILLANCE OF TRAVEL THROUGH THE COLLECTION, TRANSFER AND ANALYSIS OF PASSENGER NAME RECORD (PNR) DATA. THE ARTICLE WILL CAST LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF THE POLITICAL RHETORIC ON THE FIGHT AGAINST 'FOREIGN TERRORIST FIGHTERS' IN THE EVOLUTION OF THIS PARADIGM AND HIGHLIGHT THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS MULTI-FACETED SYSTEM OF CRIMINALISATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF TRAVEL POSE FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. A KEY CHALLENGE IN THIS CONTEXT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ABLE TO UPHOLD ITS INTERNAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS IN THE EVOLUTION OF A GLOBAL PARADIGM OF CRIMINALISATION OF TRAVEL.
127	SCHOLARS HAVE UNDERSTOOD ARISTOTLE'S THEORY OF EQUITY IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. ON THE ONE HAND, SOME CLAIM THAT EQUITY IS AN EXTRA-NORMATIVE CRITERION, THAT IS, IT GOES BEYOND THE LAW AND REACHES A SUPRA-LEGAL LEVEL IDENTIFIED WITH A METAPHYSICAL ORDER OF NATURAL JUSTICE. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME HOLD THAT EQUITY IS INTRA-NORMATIVE, THAT IS, THE JUDGE RECTIFIES LEGAL JUSTICE WITHOUT GOING BEYOND ITS LIMITS. CONSIDERING THIS SECOND POINT OF VIEW AND BY USING A METHODOLOGY THAT COMBINES LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOME OF THE MAIN THEORIES ABOUT EMOTIONS IN ANCIENT GREECE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT EQUITABLE JUDGES SHOULD NOT HAVE BROAD DISCRETION ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE'S THOUGHT. TO HOLD THAT CLAIM, I WILL MAINLY ADDRESS THE ROLE OF EMOTIONS IN THE FORMATION OF JUDGMENT AND THE POWER THEY HAVE TO ENDANGER THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING JUST AND RATIONAL JUDICIAL DECISIONS.
128	AS IN MOST COUNTRIES, HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION (HRE) IN HONG KONG HAS NEVER BEEN HIGH ON THE EDUCATIONAL AGENDA. IN 2009, A COMPULSORY SUBJECT, LIBERAL STUDIES (LS), WHICH COULD BE USED AS A PLATFORM FOR HRE, WAS INTRODUCED. THE HONG KONG INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION LAUNCHED A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WHICH, AS ONE OF ITS OBJECTIVES, STUDIED LS TEACHERS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE FIRST PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HRE. THEN, THE POTENTIAL OF HRE IN LS WILL BE DISCUSSED, FOLLOWED BY AN INTRODUCTION OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE RESEARCH DESIGN AND FINDINGS WILL BE PRESENTED. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THERE IS A LARGE GAP BETWEEN TEACHERS' UNDERSTANDINGS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. SINCE LS TEACHERS' ATTITUDES ARE CRUCIAL FOR EFFECTIVE HRE, THE FINDINGS ARE QUITE STRIKING. THE PAPER ENDS WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH, POLICY FORMULATIONS, AND TEACHER PREPARATION.
129	SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INTERNET, CHINA'S NETWORKED PUBLIC SPHERE HAS BECOME A CRITICAL SITE IN WHICH VARIOUS ACTORS COMPETE TO SHAPE PUBLIC OPINION AND PROMOTE OR FORESTALL LEGAL AND POLITICAL CHANGE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW MEMBERS OF AN ONLINE PUBLIC, THE TIANYA FORUM, CONCEPTUALIZED AND DISCUSSED LAW IN RELATION TO A SPECIFIC EVENT, THE 2008 SANLU MILK SCANDAL. WHEREAS PREVIOUS STUDIES SUGGEST THE CHINESE STATE EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS CITIZENS' LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS VIA PROPAGANDA, THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEGALITY BY THE TIANYA PUBLIC WAS NOT A TOP-DOWN PROCESS, BUT A COMPLEX NEGOTIATION INVOLVING MULTIPLE PARTIES. THE CHINESE STATE HAD TO COMPETE WITH LAWYERS AND OUTSPOKEN MEDIA TO FRAME AND INTERPRET THE SCANDAL FOR THE TIANYA PUBLIC AND IT WAS NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. DATA SHOW FURTHER HOW THE ONLINE PUBLIC FRAMED THE FOOD SAFETY INCIDENT AS INDICATIVE OF FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS ROOTED IN CHINA'S POLITICAL REGIME AND CRITIQUED THE STATE'S INSTRUMENTAL USE OF LAW.
130	THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE HOW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IMPACTS AND AFFECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED ON 25TH MAY 1981 AND IS ACTIVE TILL TO DATE, AND WHETHER PUBLIC GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THESE COUNTRIES. THE STUDY'S SAMPLE INCLUDES THE SIX GCC COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD OF 1996-2019. THE STUDY MODEL TESTS THE EFFECTS OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE WHICH ARE THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH ARE THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (ANNUAL GDP GROWTH IN %), GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH (ANNUAL IN %) AND GDP CURRENT US$) USING A MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODEL (THE FIXED EFFECT APPROACH). IN THIS STUDY, ONLY FOUR WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WERE SELECTED: THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, THIS IMPACT WAS EXAMINED USING SEVERAL CONTROL VARIABLES, INCLUDING LABOR FORCE, WORKING CAPITAL, OIL PRICE, INFLATION RATE, POPULATION, AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX. THE DATA ON DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES WAS COLLECTED FROM THE WORLD BANK OFFICIAL WEBSITE. IT IS FOUND THAT THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A POSITIVE, STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, MOREOVER, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATORY QUALITY HAVE POSITIVE, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE CONTROL VARIABLE'S RESULTS CONCERN THE LABOR FORCE, WORKING CAPITAL, OIL PRICE, INFLATION RATE, POPULATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX EXPLAINED FURTHER IN THE STUDY.
131	ARE LEGAL NORMS ISSUED BY THE STATE PURSUING THE CONCRETION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ADEQUATE LIMITS TO LEGAL DECISIONS? WE CONSIDER THAT WHETHER USING LEGAL TEXTS GRANTING HUMAN RIGHTS IS A VALUE CONCERN QUESTION: SPECIFICALLY A PROBLEM OF INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THOSE LEGAL TEXTS. DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT IN THE TEXT THEMSELVES BUT IN THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE APPLICATION OF THOSE LEGAL NORMS ISSUED BY THE STATE. IF THIS THESIS IS RIGHT THEN TO STUDY THE ETHNOMETHODS AND THE SOCIAL SEMANTICS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITIES, COULD ENABLE US TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND LEGAL DECISION-MAKING AND THE CHANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS TO BE MORE EFFICACIOUS ONCE THEY ARE IN LEGAL TEXTS.
132	MAGNA CARTA WAS INTRODUCED INTO CHINA AROUND THE MID-19TH CENTURY UNDER THE CONTEXT THAT LEARNING FROM THE WEST WAS THEN A TREND FOR CHINESE POLITICIANS AND THE ACADEMIA TO MODERNIZE CHINA. THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONALISM ORIGINATING FROM MAGNA CARTA WAS CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE MODELS FOR CHINA TO REFERENCE. EVEN THOUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN THE LATE QING DYNASTY FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CHINA, THE STRIVE FOR RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN CHINA WAS NEVER DISRUPTED FROM THEN ON. IN THE FIRST CENTURY OF MAGNA CARTA'S INTRODUCTION INTO CHINA, THE ACADEMIA USED THE IDEAS OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW EMBEDDED IN MAGNA CARTA TO INFLUENCE CONSTITUTIONALITY IN CHINA, ESPECIALLY TO PUSH FORWARD THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY. EVEN THOUGH THE CONSTITUTIONALISM WAS NOT FINALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE RESEARCH ON MAGNA CARTA INSPIRED THE IDEA OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CHINA. IN ADDITION, THE CHINESE ACADEMIA REALIZED THAT WHAT CHINA SHOULD LEARN WAS THE SPIRIT OF MAGNA CARTA, AND THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM SHALL BE BASED ON THE CONTEXT OF CHINESE HISTORY AND CULTURE.
133	THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE CURRENT STATE OF PUBLIC LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IN CHINA, WHICH WE REGARD AS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF AND AN EMPIRICAL INDICATOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN LEGAL CULTURE. USING DATA FROM THE 2004 SURVEY ON INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF LEGAL REFORMS IN CHINA WE FIRST DEMONSTRATE THE RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF PUBLIC LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IN CHINA AND THE STARK DISPARITIES BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL POPULATIONS. WE FURTHER EXPLORE FACTORS THAT CALL EXPLAIN THE VARIATIONS THROUGH MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. WE FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION, INCOME, RESIDENCY, AND MODE OF PRODUCTION. EXPOSURE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD SERVES AS A LEARNING PROCESS ABOUT FUNCTIONS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND THE MEDIA PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISSEMINATING LEGAL INFORMATION. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOCUSING ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM OR LEGAL ISSUES ALSO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT CHANNEL FOR THE PUBLIC TO ACQUIRE PRACTICAL LEGAL KNOWLEDGE. WE CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING POTENTIAL APPROACHES TO INCREASING CHINESE PUBLIC LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND NARROWING THE DISPARITIES, INCLUDING INCREASING THE POPULATION'S EDUCATION AND INCOME LEVELS AND BROADENING ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND COVERAGE BY THE MEDIA.
134	THE BELGIAN EUTHANASIA ACT OF 2002 DECRIMINALIZES THE PRACTICE OF VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA IN BELGIUM.(1,2) IT GRANTS LEGAL AUTHORIZATION TO A PATIENT TO REQUEST TO BE EUTHANIZED BY A PHYSICIAN IF THE FORMER IS SUFFERING FROM UNBEARABLE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ILLNESS WITH NO HOPE OF RECOVERY AND IF CERTAIN LEGAL, MEDICAL, AND ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. CONCURRENTLY, IT DECRIMINALIZES THE PRACTICE OF VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA BY A PHYSICIAN, TO DEPART FROM THE TRANSCENDENTAL FIRST DO NO HARM ROLE OF THE HIPPOCRATIC PHYSICIAN TO BECOME A 'FOR HIRE TO EITHER CURE OR TO KILL' ROLE OF THE PRE-HIPPOCRATIC PHYSICIAN.(3,4) ALTHOUGH THE ACT AXIOMATICALLY UPHOLDS THE DRAFTERS' ORIGINAL INTENT TO ALLOW FOR THE LAWFUL PRACTICE OF VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA, CERTAIN PERTINENT SECTIONS IN THE ACT ARE PROBLEMATICALLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE, ALLOWING FOR ARBITRARY INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW. THE PAPER WILL HIGHLIGHT THE FATALLY FLAWED PERTINENT SECTIONS FOLLOWED BY PROPOSALS FOR REFORM.
135	THE SOCIAL STATE IS A HISTORICAL TYPE OF STATE THAT HAS DEEPENED AND BROADENED THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF LIBERAL STATES, AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND DEPTH DEPEND ON CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION AND THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC STRATEGY. THUS, SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE EU HAS INTENSIFIED THE PRESENCE AND RELEVANCE OF SOCIAL OBJECTIVES IN ITS ECONOMIC STRATEGY, PRESENTING THEM AS NECESSARY FOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SUCCESS OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT. AMONG THE LESSONS LEARNED, THE CHANGE IN THE FISCAL PARADIGM AND THE MOBILIZATION OF INSTRUMENTS TO CORRECT INEQUALITIES STAND OUT, ALTHOUGH GREATER COORDINATION OF THE MEMBER STATES IS NEEDED. IN THIS REGARD, THE STRENGTHENING OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN PILLAR OF SOCIAL RIGHTS AND THE REFORM OF THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER ARE PROPOSED. WHEN IT COMES TO MEASUREMENT, IN THE LAST 30 YEARS SOME INDEXES HAVE BEEN CREATED TO MEASURE WELL-BEING, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, HAPPINESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE, AND A MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE HAS BEEN PROPOSED BASED ON POVERTY PREVENTION, ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND LABOR MARKET, SOCIAL INCLUSION AND NON-DISCRIMINATION, HEALTH AND INTERGENERATIONAL JUSTICE. CHILE JOINED THIS MEASUREMENT IN 2019 AND HAS MARGIN FOR IMPROVEMENT IN SOME DIMENSIONS. THESE DATA CAN HELP TO SUPPORT ADEQUATE LEGISLATION AND GOOD GOVERNMENT ACTION, IN VIEW OF A FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN THE COUNTRY.
136	THIS IS THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE TALK GIVEN BY MR MALIK R DAHLAN AT THE 2011 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW. AN EXPERT IN ISLAMIC GOVERNANCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE WIDER ARAB WORLD, MR DAHLAN POINTED OUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF UNDERLYING ETHICAL VALUES AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ISLAMIC FINANCE INDUSTRY, WHICH ARE ALSO POSITIVE ASPECTS THAT CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO "CONVENTIONAL" FINANCE.
137	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE CONCEPT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, BY EXAMINING FIRSTLY ITS GENERAL DEFINITION AND CONSIDERING ITS ANATOMY ON THE BASIS OF ITS TWO MAIN MANIFES-TATIONS: ITS STATUS AS A NECESSARY QUALITY FOR A COURT OR TRIBUNAL OF A MEMBER STATE TO BE CONSIDERED AS SUCH WITH REGARD TO PRELIMINARY RULINGS AND ITS NATURE AS A SINE QUA NON REQUISITE OF THE RULE OF LAW. LIKEWISE, SOME CONSIDERATIONS ARE MADE ON THE CONSE-QUENCES OF SUCH CONFIGURATION WITHIN THE UNION'S OWN LEGAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS ITS INTERACTION WITH OTHER STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THAT DIALOGUE WITH THE COMMUNITY STANDARD.
138	THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAS THE MOST CASES PENDING BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN STRASBOURG. RECENT STUDIES ON THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA INDICATE THAT RUSSIANS ARE VIGOROUSLY LITIGATING BEFORE DOMESTIC COURTS AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS, DESPITE LOW LEVELS OF TRUST IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. YET, IS CLAIM MAKING INSIDE THE COUNTRY THE CAUSE OF THE BURGEONING CASELOAD PENDING BEFORE THE COURT? THIS REVIEW ESSAY EVALUATES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF JUDGMENTS AND CLAIMS COMING FROM RUSSIA AND MAPS OUT RECENT LITERATURE ON THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LITIGATION WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN PARTICULAR, IT PUTS FORWARD A RESEARCH AGENDA FOR STUDYING THE ACTORS BEHIND LITIGATION AND THE TYPES OF CASES THEY BRING TO THE COURT. FURTHERMORE, THE ESSAY PROPOSES HOW WE MIGHT ANALYZE SOME OF THESE COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE ECTHR FROM A SOCIOLEGAL PERSPECTIVE.
139	IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FUNDAMENTAL RESULTS IN PUNISHING CORRUPTION CRIME, WE SHOULD ADHERE TO THE LEGAL ANTI-CORRUPTION PATTERN, ADVANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND MAKE ANTI-CORRUPTION STANDARDIZED AND INSTITUTIONALIZED. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE SHOULD REFORM AND IMPROVE THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE FOR CORRUPTION CRIME IN CHINA. PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT PROCEDURE FOR CORRUPTION CRIME MAINLY INCLUDE: THE PRESUMPTION RULES FOR CORRUPTION CRIME HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE ABSENCE OF STIGMA WITNESS EXEMPTION SYSTEM, THE WITNESS PROTECTION SYSTEM, THE INVESTIGATION JURISDICTION ARE NOT PERFECT, THE SUPERVISION OF INVESTIGATION IS WEAK, THE LACK OF ABSENTEE TRIAL SYSTEM FOR CORRUPT CRIME, THE NON-INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF OFF-SITE TRIAL, TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION MEASURES MAY BE ABUSED, AND DIFFICULTIES IN PERSON SOUGHT FOR CORRUPTION AND ASSET RECOVERY. TO REFORM AND IMPROVE THE PROCEDURE FOR CORRUPTION CRIME IN CHINA, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR CORRUPTION CRIME BE SET UP AS APPROPRIATE, RELEVANT CONTENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (UNCAC) SHOULD BE REASONABLY ABSORBED, AND EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO PROMOTE THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE REFORM ACHIEVEMENTS IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF CORRUPTION CRIME.
140	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND EXAMINES THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE US, OROMOS IN ETHIOPIA, AND SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SUDANESE IN SUDAN EMERGED, AND THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF THESE MOVEMENTS IN A GLOBAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE. IT SPECIFICALLY EXPLORES FOUR INTERRELATED ISSUES. FIRST, THE PAPER DEALS WITH SOME THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INSIGHTS. SECOND, THE PIECE EXPLAINS HOW THE RACIALIZED CAPITALIST WORLD SYSTEM AND ITS POLITICAL STRUCTURES FACILITATED THE CREATION OF THE STATES OF THE US, ETHIOPIA, AND SUDAN AND LEGALIZED RACIAL/ETHNONATIONAL OPPRESSION, COLONIALISM, EXPLOITATION, AND CONTINUED SUBJUGATION. THIRD, IT EXPLAINS COMPARATIVELY THE PROCESSES, DEVELOPMENTS, OBJECTIVES, AND OUTCOMES OF THESE MOVEMENTS. FINALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AS THE PROMOTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL SELF-DETERMINATION AND DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
141	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEMALE PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL MANAGEMENT AND THE QUALITY OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES. OUR RESEARCH IS DESIGNED AS A COMPARATIVE IMPACT STUDY IN WHICH WE SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTION OF FEMALE POLITICAL COMMITMENT EXPRESSED BY THE SHARE OF WOMEN IN NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS, ON FOUR REFERENTIAL INDICATORS, NAMELY THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATIVE REGULATIONS, THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT/ ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN THIS SENSE, WE OPERATED A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CORRELATION AND DETERMINATION, BASED ON THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION, WITH THE AIM OF EVALUATING THE EXPLANATORY CONTRIBUTION OF THE FEMINIZATION OF POLITICAL MANAGEMENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE LISTED PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT COMPONENTS, IN DIFFERENT AREAS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF INCREASED FEMALE REPRESENTATION IN SHAPING A MORE INCLUSIVE AND EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK WITHIN EU.
142	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES OF RECENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPMENT IN ALBANIA. EUROPEANIZATION AND TRANSITION ARE IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INTERPLAY BETWEEN DEMOCRATIZATION, POLITICAL STABILIZATION AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM. KEY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM ARE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED. THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THAT ARE ANALYZED: POLICY-MAKING CAPACITY AND HORIZONTAL COORDINATION AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL, CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM AND THE MODERNIZATION OF HUMAN POTENTIALS MANAGEMENT, DECENTRALIZATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEMS OF ALBANIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY HISTORIC LEGACY, ESPECIALLY FROM THE COMMUNIST PERIOD, AND BY THE INSTABILITY OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS. THE PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS IS TO IDENTIFY THE PRIORITIES IN REFORMING POLITICO-ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM IN ALBANIA AND TO PROPOSE A SEQUENTIAL REFORM PATTERN. THIS IS BECAUSE ALBANIA LACKS POLITICAL, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PREREQUISITES TO CARRY OUT A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ALL AT ONCE.
143	STATES BURDENED WITH CONFLICT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE UNDESIRABLE DESTINATIONS FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) DUE TO,INTER ALIA, POLITICAL INSTABILITY,REGULATORY UNPREDICTABILITY, AND EXPROPRIATION RISK. HOWEVER, WE DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW BASED ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REAL OPTION THEORIES. WE ANALYZE A DATASET OF FDI LOCATION DECISIONS MADE IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR BY 250 US FIRMS ACROSS 44 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR ENERGY RESERVES, THE RESULTS SHOW COUNTER-INTUITIVELY, THAT CIVIL WAR AND TERRORISM RISKS, AND TERRORIST EVENTS ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH US INVESTMENT IN OIL AND GAS. US SUBSIDIARIES ALSO SHOW HIGH LEVELS OF OWNERSHIP COMMITMENT. IT IS TEMPTING TO CONCLUDE THAT US OIL AND GAS IS A WHOLLY UNIQUE, RESOURCE-BOUND CASE, BUT WE ARGUE THAT THIS DISCONNECT MAY HAVE OCCURRED FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST, A THREAT OF CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE CAN MAKE MNES EXERCISE THEIR GROWTH OPTIONS AND EXPAND RESOURCE EXTRACTION SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. SECOND, POLITICAL INSTABILITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO HIGHER LEVELS OF FDI EXPROPRIATION RISK. ON THE CONTRARY, INSTABILITY CANREDUCETHE INCENTIVES FOR THE STATE TO SEIZE ASSETS FROM TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR MNES,I.E.IT MAY REDUCE EXPROPRIATION RISK. JUST AS THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD' GOVERNANCE CAN CONSTRAIN A STATE FROM EXPROPRIATION, THERE ARE THEORETICAL REASONS WHY BAD' GOVERNANCE RESULTING FROM INSTABILITY AND INCAPACITY MAY DO SO, TOO.
144	SOCIAL AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ARE GAINING IMPORTANCE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, DIGITALISATION, AND OTHER SOCIETAL CHANGES. WHEN EXERCISING SOCIAL RIGHTS, PROCEDURAL ELEMENTS SHOULD BE SEEN - BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES - AS FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE WELFARE STATE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND GOOD ADMINISTRATION, AND NOT AS AN EXCUSE FOR A BUREAUCRATIC ATTITUDE. IN VIEW OF THE MULTIFUNCTIONALITY OF SOCIAL PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THEIR CASUAL-FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR A CRITICAL VALUE-BASED EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT REGULATION, THE RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES CONDUCTED BY THE 16 SOCIAL WORK CENTRES (SWCS) IN SLOVENIA. A SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE INFORMATIONAL CALCULATION OF SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS, SUCH AS CHILD BENEFITS, KINDERGARTEN SUBSIDIES OR STATE SCHOLARSHIPS -BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS PROCEDURES INVOLVING SOCIAL RIGHTS IN SLOVENIA, WITH OVER ONE MILLION CASES ANNUALLY. DRAWING UPON A NORMATIVE ANALYSIS, AVAILABLE STATISTICS, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH SWCS MANAGERS AND SURVEYS AMONG EMPLOYEES, THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THE RESPONSE OF SWCS TO THE CRISIS HAS IMPROVED. HOWEVER, LARGELY DUE TO THE LACK OF COORDINATION ON THE PART OF THE LINE MINISTRY, THE SIMPLIFICATIONS INTRODUCED MAINLY BENEFIT THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RATHER THAN PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE PARTIES TO THE PROCEDURE. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A NEED TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO PROVIDING THE PARTIES WITH ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF GOOD PUBLIC GOVERNANCE.
145	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES PUT IN PLACE BY THE FOUNDING FATHERS FAILED TO STOP THE MANY ATTACKS BY PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY (INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT). THE RESULT IS AN EROSION OF WRITTEN NORMS (ARTICLE III, FIRST AMENDMENT, EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE) AND OF UNWRITTEN NORMS. AMONG THE LATTER, THE REFUSAL TO PUBLISH HIS INCOME TAX RETURN AND TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS (AND THE APPEARANCE OF CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS) BY PLACING HIS HOLDINGS IN A BLIND TRUST. THE RESULT IS BOTH A DETERIORATION OF US INSTITUTIONS AND VALUES AND A SHIFT TOWARDS AN ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
146	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE "PROTECTIVE POTENTIAL" OF THE GLOBAL COMPACTS ON REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS VIS A VIS EXISTING COMMITMENTS TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO NORMATIVE FRAMEWORKS IS SCRUTINISED TO ESTABLISH THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE TWO MIGHT BE MUTUALLY SUPPORTIVE OR CONTRADICTORY, SINCE THIS DETERMINES THE COMPACTS' CAPACITY TO INFORM THE INTERPRETATION OF EU FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITHIN THE COMMON EUROPEAN ASYLUM SYSTEM (CEAS). THIS PAPER EXPLORES THIS PROTECTIVE POTENTIAL THROUGH THREE OF THE COMPACTS' KEY GUIDING PRINCIPLES: RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-REGRESSION, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION. THE COMPACTS' COMMITMENTS TO THE FIRST TWO ARE PRESENTED AS SITES OF COHERENCE WHERE THE COMPACTS CONCRETELY EXPRESS PRE-EXISTING PROTECTIONS WITHIN EU LAW AND PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE MIGRATION SPHERE. HOWEVER, THE COMPACTS' PRINCIPLE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION REVEALS AN AREA OF FRICTION WITH EU PRIMARY LAW. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE CAN ADDRESS THE INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATORY SYSTEM UNDERPINNING EU LAW. WITHIN THE EU, RATHER THAN UNDERMINING INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPACTS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFINE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING EU FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS APPLICABLE TO MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES.
147	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES TEACHING REFLECTION SKILLS AS A MEANS TO INCULCATE STUDENTS' CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO JUSTICE. ARISING OUT OF UNDERSTANDINGS OF PROFESSIONALISM, THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS MODEL CODES OF CONDUCT FOR SOLICITORS, LAWYERS HAVE AN ETHICAL DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING THE JUSTICE OF LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM. LEARNING HOW TO REFLECT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF BEING ABLE TO FULFIL THIS DUTY, AND CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION AS A METHOD WITHIN LEGAL EDUCATION IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO REFLECT. THEY LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH 'DISORIENTING MOMENTS' AND TO MAKE SENSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF LEGAL PRACTICE THROUGH A PROCESS OF SELF-REFLECTION AND REFLECTION ON LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH REFLECTION CAN BE TAUGHT TO EMPHASISE THE INTEGRATION OF VALUES, EMOTIONS, THINKING AND ANALYTICAL SKILLS IN FORMING LAWYERS WHO ARE WELL- ROUNDED LAWYERS. A GROWTH MINDSET WHICH RECOGNISES THE ABILITY OF BRAINS TO CONSTANTLY CHANGE AND GROW IS A RADICAL AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH SUPPORTS THE NURTURING OF LAWYERS' ABILITY TO REFLECT AND CONTINUE TO FULFIL THEIR ETHICAL DUTY TO WORK TOWARDS JUSTICE IN SOME FORM.
148	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT RUI BARBOSA'S ROLE AT THE HAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE OF 1907 AND HIS SPEECH AT THE BUENOS AIRES LAW SCHOOL, IN 1916, ARE A CONTINUUM. ON BOTH OCCASIONS, HE NOT ONLY DEFENDED THE SAME PRINCIPLES, THE RULE OF LAW OVER FORCE AND THE JURIDICAL EQUALITY OF NATIONS, AND MAINLY, FOUGHT THE SAME ENEMY: A DOCTRINE, THE 'BORUSSIAN MILITARIST DOCTRINE'. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A CONTEXTUALIST HISTORIOGRAPHY, THIS TEXT RECREATES THAT STRUGGLE. THIS WORK EMPLOYS THE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF APPROACH AS WELL AS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOURCES.
149	THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE FROM 2016 TO 2019 ON THE INTERPRETATION OF 'JUDICIAL AUTHORITY' IN ARTICLE 6(1) FD-EAW ESSENTIALLY EXAMINES WHETHER A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR CAN BE AN ISSUING JUDICIAL AUTHORITY AND IF SO, HOW MEMBER STATES' SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING EAWS ENSURE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION FOR THE PERSON CONCERNED. FOR THE ADVOCATE GENERAL, APPLYING THE COURT'S 'RULE OF LAW' JURISPRUDENCE, EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION WHEN DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY IS INVOLVED CAN ONLY BE ASSURED BY A BODY WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, BEING A COURT. THE COURT'S BROADER APPROACH OF INCLUDING PUBLIC PROSECUTORS WITH SUFFICIENCY OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE EXECUTIVE AND REQUIRING THEIR DECISIONS TO BE AMENABLE TO REVIEW BY A COURT, WHEN APPLIED IN PRACTICE ARGUABLY FALLS SHORT OF THE REQUISITE STANDARD OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION. THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT ACCESS TO THE INTERPRETATIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT BY PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ACTING AS JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND EU COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS WOULD NOW BE BETTER SERVED BY THE DESIGNATION IN ALL MEMBER STATES OF A COURT AS THE ISSUING JUDICIAL AUTHORITY FOR THE FD-EAW. THIS IS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE UNIQUELY COERCIVE NATURE OF THE EAW IN TERMS OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY; THE DIFFERENCES IN MEMBER STATES' INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUBLIC PROSECUTORS AND THE POST-LISBON EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
150	THIS STUDY ANALYSES HOW THE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE HEART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE RULE OF LAW, IS ADAPTING TO THE IRRUPTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES. THEREFORE, AFTER FOCUSING ON THE ROLES AND FUNCTIONS THAT ALGORITHMS CAN ASSUME IN THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR POLYHEDRAL AND MULTI-FACETED CHARACTER, IT WILL REFLECT ON THE NEED FOR A EUROPEAN PROCEDURAL STATUTE OF AI. TO THIS END, IT WILL CONSIDER WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO REGULATE THE << ALGORITHMIC DUE PROCESS OF LAW >>, WHICH REQUIRES RETHINKING THE BASIC CATEGORIES OF LAW, THROUGH COMPATIBILITY JUDGEMENT, AND THE STATE OF THE ISSUE, REFERRING TO HOW IT IS PROGRESSIVELY BEING REGULATED AND ESPECIALLY TO THE PROPOSAL FOR AN EU REGULATION ON AI, ADOPTED IN APRIL 2021, WHICH AIMS TO BUILD AN << ECOSYSTEM OF GUARANTEES >>.
151	THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WAS RECENTLY FACED WITH THE DELICATE QUESTION OF WIZEN IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR A TRIAL COURT TO REMOVE A DELIBERATING JUROR WHO REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE COURT'S INSTRUCTIONS ON THE LAW. IN AN OPINION WITH A MULTIPURPOSE AGENDA, JUDGE JOSE CABRANES NOT ONLY SET FORTH A STANDARD FOR TRIAL COURTS TO USE WHEN CONSIDERING REMOVING A JUROR DURING DELIBERATIONS PURSUANT TO RULE 23(B) OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, BUT ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH CONDEMN THE PRACTICE OF JURY, NULLIFICATION AND CHAMPION THE IMPORTANCE OF SECRET AND PRIVATE JURY DELIBERATIONS. GIVEN THE DIVERSE AIMS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE OPINION IN UNITED STATES V. THOMAS, 116 F.3D 606 (2ND CIR: 1997), IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY HAVE BOTH HAILED AND DECRIED IT. THE OPINION, WHILE LOGICALLY SOUND AND ON ITS FACE QUIRE LIMITED, DOES SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. AS SUCH, THE OPINION CALLS FOR CLOSE SCRUTINY.
152	WE STUDY THE CAUSAL EFFECTS OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ON FIRM ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION BY EXPLOITING A QUASI -EXPERIMENT PROVIDED BY A PILOT REFORM PROGRAM ON ENVIRONMENTAL TRIBUNALS. USING THE DATA ON CHINESE LISTED COMPANIES IN HEAVY POLLUTION INDUSTRIES, WE FIND THAT FIRM ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES FOLLOWING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TRIBUNALS WITH A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATION. IN ADDITION, THIS FINDING IS MORE SIGNIFICANT IN SUBSAMPLES WITH STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES, LARGER FIRMS, AND REGIONS WITH DEEPER GREEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND WORSE JUDICIAL ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL TRIBUNALS BOOST FIRM ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION THROUGH STRENGTHENING JUDICIAL INTERVENTION, ESPECIALLY ENHANCING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND INCREASING PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. OUR PAPER PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE PUSHING POWER OF ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND THE WEAK VERSION OF THE PORTER HYPOTHESIS. ALSO, IT SERVES AS A REFERENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL TRIBUNALS IN CHINA AND FOR OTHER POLICYMAKERS WHO MAY CONCERN.
153	IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES INTEREST RATES VARY INVERSELY WITH THE RISK OF DEFAULT, WHICH ITSELF IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE BORROWER'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. THE FORMER RELATIONSHIP DEPENDS ON THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE LAW. WHERE THE LAW IS MARKEDLY BIASED IN FAVOUR OF CERTAIN GROUPS, THESE GROUPS WILL PAY A SURCHARGE FOR CAPITAL. LEGAL POWER, AS MEASURED BY PRIVILEGES BEFORE THE LAW, THUS UNDERMINES FINANCIAL POWER, THE CAPACITY TO BORROW CHEAPLY. DEVELOPING THIS ARGUMENT, THIS ARTICLE ALSO TESTS IT THROUGH JUDICIAL RECORDS FROM OTTOMAN ISTANBUL, 1602-1799. THREE PRIVILEGED OTTOMAN GROUPS-MEN, MUSLIMS AND TITLED ELITES-ALL PAID RELATIVELY HIGH INTEREST RATES CONDITIONAL ON VARIOUS LOAN CHARACTERISTICS.
154	WASHINGTON DC IS NOT ONLY A CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY PROMOTION PROGRAMS BY GOVERNMENT FUNDED AND PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS AND THINK TANKS. WASHINGTON DC HAS ALSO ATTRACTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR LOBBYISTS, POLITICAL CONSULTANTS AND THINK TANKS FROM AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL FORCES AND KLEPTOCRATS WHO HAVE LITTLE IN COMMON WITH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN VALUES. BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF THESE ILLICIT FUNDS FROM STATE OFFICIALS AND OLIGARCHS WHO ARE SEEKING TO INGRATIATE THEMSELVES WITH AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION. POLITICAL CONSULTANTS, LOBBYISTS, LAWYERS AND THINK TANKS WHICH RECEIVE FUNDS FROM SUCH SOURCES ARE PART OF A BIGGER PROBLEM OF REVERSE CORRUPTION AND CYNICISM AND THE EXPORT OF AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES FROM UKRAINE AND POST-SOVIET STATES TO THE WEST. THIS WAS CLEARLY SEEN IN THE HIRING OF PAUL MANAFORT, VIKTOR YANU-KOVYCH'S LONG-TIME POLITICAL CONSULTANT BY US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP'S PROMISE TO 'DRAIN THE (WASHINGTON) SWAMP' RINGS HOLLOW AFTER IT WAS REVEALED HE ACCEPTED FUNDS FROM A UKRAINIAN OLIGARCH WHO HAD EARLIER DONATED FUNDS TO THE CLINTON'S (READER 2016).

155	IN 1867, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PASSED ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL-MINDED AND DRACONIAN LAWS EVER CREATED IN COLONIAL INDIA. KNOWN AS THE MURDEROUS OUTRAGES ACT', THIS LAW GAVE COLONIAL OFFICIALS ALONG THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER WIDE POWERS TO TRANSGRESS INDIA'S LEGAL CODES IN ORDER TO SUMMARILY EXECUTE AND DISPOSE OF INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED AS FANATICS'. ARGUMENTS FOR THE CREATION AND PRESERVATION OF THIS LAW INVARIABLY CENTRED AROUND CLAIMS ABOUT THE PURPORTEDLY EXCEPTIONAL' CHARACTER OF FRONTIER GOVERNANCE, PARTICULARLY THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A REGION THAT EXISTED IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF WAR AND CRISIS. FAR FROM BEING PERIPHERAL IN ITS IMPACT, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THIS LAW BOTH DREW UPON AND ENABLED A WIDER LEGAL CULTURE THAT PERVADED INDIA IN THE WAKE OF 1857. IT ARGUES THAT THIS LAW WAS A SIGNAL EXAMPLE OF BRITISH ATTEMPTS TO MASK THE BRUTE POWER OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THROUGH LEGALISTIC TERMS, AND WAS ALSO EVOCATIVE OF A DISTINCTLY WARLIKE' LOGIC OF COLONIAL LEGALITY.
156	IN JANUARY 2023, ISRAEL'S NEWLY FORMED COALITION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LIKUD PARTY BEGAN TO PROMOTE A REFORM THAT WOULD ALTER THE NATURE OF THE REGIME AND UNDERMINE THE DEMOCRATIC TENETS OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THE ARTICLE DETERMINES THAT THE PLANNED GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL DIVERGES SHARPLY FROM THE HISTORIC PATH OF "THE LIKUD," AND DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE WORLDVIEW AND POLICIES HELD BY THE PARTY'S FOUNDING FATHER AND LEADER FOR OVER THREE DECADES, MENACHEM BEGIN. IN THIS RESPECT, WHAT IS REFERRED TO BY THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AS A "JUDICIAL REFORM" IS IN FACT A TWO-FOLD PROJECT THAT AIMS TO REFORM THE REGIME AS WELL AS THE FOUNDATIONAL POLICIES OF LAW UPHELD BY THE RULING POLITICAL PARTY IN ISRAEL FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES. THE ARTICLE SHEDS LIGHT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE IDEOLOGY ATTRIB-UTED TO THE "RIGHT" AND THE "LEFT" IN ISRAEL'S POLITICAL HISTORIOGRAPHY AND DETERMINES THAT THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PROPOSED REFORM ARE NOT INTRINSIC TO RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGY AND SHOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS SUCH. THE SHARP DEPARTURE REVEALED BY THE RIGHT-WING REFORM POLICY AND ITS IDEAS ON QUESTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE AT THIS WATERSHED MOMENT PROVIDE A THEORETICAL-HISTORICAL BASIS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND PROCESSES.
157	IN THE SEMINAL WORK OF JURGEN HABERMAS, THE THEORY OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE FROM 1962, THE PUBLIC IS CONCEIVED OF AS THE FORUM WHERE THE STRUCTURE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IS COMBINED WITH THE STATE AS AN AUTHORITY STRUCTURE. IT IS THE QUINTESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY. THIS BOOK GAVE A SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC VIEW OF THE CRITICAL POTENTIAL OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE IN LATE MODERN SOCIEITES - THAT IS, UP TO THE SIXTIES. THE PUBLIC WAS INFUSED WITH STRATEGIC ACTION AND HAD DEGENERATED BECAUSE OF A PROPAGANDISTIC AND COMMERCIALIZED PRESS. LATER ON HABERMAS DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOCIETY UNDERSTOOD AS A SYSTEM AND AS A LIFEWORLD (CF. THEORY OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION, 1981). THIS CHANGED THE THEORETICAL STATUS OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE, BUT IT WAS STILL HELD TO PLAY A DECISIVE ROLE IN MODERN POLITICS. NEW QUESTIONS AND NEW PROPOSALS HAVE EMERGED ON THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND REACHED THROUGH THE PARLIAMENTARY COMPLEX AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF CAPITAL AND ESTABLISHED PARTIES. THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IS AN INDICATOR OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE STILL BEING ABLE TO FULFILL ITS CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. IN HIS NEW BOOK FAKTIZITAT GELTUNG (1992) HABERMAS DEMONSTRATES HOW THE PUBLIC SPHERE IS A SENSITIVE SENSOR OF SOCIAL PATHOLOGIES AND DYSFUNCTIONS AND, IN ADDITION TO CONTROLLING THE POLITICO-ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM, ALSO MANAGES TO INFLUENCE AND TRANSFORM IT. IN THIS BOOK HABERMAS DEVELOPS A PROCEDURALIST CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY BASED ON DISCOURSE THEORY WHICH IS A WORKABLE ALTERNATIVE TO REALIST, LIBERAL AND REPUBLICAN CONCEPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY.
158	AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION AND THE END OF THE COLD WAR, THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE MADE THE TRANSITION TO THE CAPITALIST MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT IN A VERY SHORT SPACE OF TIME. THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THIS TRANSITION CAN BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD IF ONE CONSIDERS THAT IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PROCESS OF (WEBERIAN) STATE CREATION, THE STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY, THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONHOOD AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADEQUATE SOCIAL POLICIES. NONETHELESS, THE DIFFERENCES IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL POLICIES BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE ARE SO LARGE THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS TRANSITION WERE VERY DIVERSE ALSO, AS WE CAN OBSERVE TODAY.
159	THIS PAPER SEEKS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE TRENDS OF CONTEMPORARY ETHICISATION IN VARIOUS AREAS OF LIFE, FROM BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY TO SCIENCE AND POLITICS, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE LEGAL DOMAIN. THE KEY QUESTION IS: HOW DOES NOWADAYS IMMENSELY ENLARGED ETHICISATION OF THE LIFEWORLD RELATE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATING LEGALITY FROM MORALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS THE MINIMUM OF MORAL IN THE SOCIETY? THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS ANALYSIS IS THOMASIUS' DIVISION OF NATURAL LAW INTO HONESTUM, DECORUM AND IUSTUM, AS WELL AS KANT'S DICHOTOMY OF THE METAPHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DOCTRINE OF LAW AND VIRTUE IN THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS. THIS FRAMEWORK REPRESENTS THE PINNACLE OF THE DEMAND OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT ERA FOR A SEPARATION OF THE SPHERES OF LEGALITY AND MORALITY. THE QUESTION IS RAISED AS TO WHETHER CONTEMPORARY ETHICAL TENDENCIES UNDERMINE THE LEGACY OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS. BASED ON THIS DICHOTOMOUS MODEL, THE IMPACT OF THE RECENT EXPANSION OF PROFESSIONAL, MEDICAL, SCIENTIFIC, BUSINESS AND OTHER FORMS OF ETHICS, THE MASSIVE ESTABLISHMENT OF ETHICS COMMITTEES, POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, AND THE MEDIATION OF PUBLIC OPINION ON THE FRAMEWORK OF HUMAN FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS IS FURTHER ELABORATED. BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION, TWO EXEMPLARY CASE STUDIES FROM CROATIA ARE PRESENTED-THE NORMATIVE FLAWS OF A CODE OF ETHICS AND THE MISUSE OF AN ETHICAL BODY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. THE CONCLUSION ELABORATES HOW CONTEMPORARY ETHICISATION CAN PRODUCE GOOD RESULTS BY PROMOTING LEGAL ISSUES AND LEGAL PROTECTION. HOWEVER, IT SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE LIMITS AND UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. THE SEPARATION OF MORALITY AND LAW IS AN IMPORTANT LEGACY OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. THE UNBRIDLED AND EXTENSIVE ETHICISATION OF VARIOUS SPHERES, THOUGH, CAN BE DEVASTATING TO GOOD ORDER AND WELL-BEING IN THE CONTEMPORARY INCREASINGLY PLURALISTIC AND MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. THEREFORE, THE IMPARTIAL TRIBUNALS SHOULD JUDGE BY THE CENTURIES-OLD AND ESTABLISHED STANDARDS OF JUSTICE; THEY DO IT MORE EQUITABLY THAN THE PROVISIONAL ETHICAL COMMITTEES AND THE AD HOC APPOINTED COMMISSIONERS WOULD. ETHICS MAY CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH THE INNER SIDE OF ACTION AND MAXIMS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ETHICAL MAXIMS ARE NOT ALWAYS BOUND TO EXTERNAL COMPULSION. THE FULL REALISATION OF HUMAN FREEDOM DEPENDS ON THIS ESSENTIAL DISTINCTION, WHICH EVERY SOCIETY SHOULD CAREFULLY DETERMINE AND REGULATE.
160	UNTIL RECENTLY, INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS DID NOT CAUSE ANY PUBLIC REACTION AND WERE CONSIDERED IRRELEVANT TO EVERYDAY LIFE. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EXISTING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS FROM NAFTA, THROUGH TPP, TO TTIP AND CETA, WHICH ARE IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS OR RATIFICATION, HAS SHOWN THAT THEY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE DAILY LIVES OF CITIZENS AND AFFECT THE ENTIRE SOCIETY AND ECONOMY. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NEGOTIATED AND CONCLUDED BY NEGLECTING ETHICAL PRINCIPLES, DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES, AND HUMAN RIGHTS, WHERE ONLY ECONOMIC INTERESTS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. IN THIS PAPER WE WILL EXPLORE HOW THESE AGREEMENTS UNDERMINE UNIVERSAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND DEMOCRATIC STANDARDS THROUGH THE ISDS MECHANISM, IMPOSING THE ECONOMIC INTEREST OF LARGE CAPITAL AGAINST THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY, THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL REFER PARTICULARLY TO THE WORK OF ALFRED-MAURICE DE ZAYAS, THE UNITED NATIONS INDEPENDENT EXPERT ON THE PROMOTION OF A DEMOCRATIC AND EQUITABLE INTERNATIONAL ORDER (ALSO KNOWN AS SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR), WHO IN HIS REPORTS TO THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND IN MEDIA APPEARANCES FIERCELY CRITICISES THE ISDS MECHANISM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN AGREEMENTS SUCH AS CETA AND TTIP.
161	WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL INFORMATIZATION, THE INTERNET HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT CHANNEL FOR GLOBAL INFORMATION DISSEMINATION. THE WIRELESS NETWORK SPACE AND THE REAL SPACE ARE INTERTWINED AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY. FOR EXAMPLE, IT CAN EFFECTIVELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN CITIES, REGIONS, AND COUNTRIES. WIRELESS NETWORK CRIME AND WIRELESS NETWORK SPACE SECURITY ISSUES INVOLVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, INVOLVE ALL ASPECTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY. IN THE AGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, THE CURRENT SITUATION OF CYBERCRIME CAN BE EXPRESSED BY DATA AS FOLLOWS: THE ONLINE CRIME RATE IS HIGH. ACCORDING TO RELEVANT STATISTICS, NEARLY 5 MILLION INTERNET USERS ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS CASES EVERY YEAR DUE TO THE USE OF THE INTERNET. THIS ARTICLE STARTS WITH THE DIGITAL FORENSICS OF WIRELESS NETWORK CRIME AND WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND DISCUSSES THE COMPOSITION, CHARACTERISTICS, EXISTING PROBLEMS, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIONS OF THE CURRENT WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. BY COMPARING THE WIRELESS NETWORK SECURITY LAWS OF CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, USING THE LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION (LDA)-GIBBS MODEL AND THE K-MEANS ALGORITHM TO ANALYZE THE DATA, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON WIRELESS NETWORK SPACE GOVERNANCE. THE COMBINATION OF DIGITAL FORENSICS ANALYSIS BASED ON CYBERCRIME AND SPACE GOVERNANCE CAN IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SECURITY WORK. AT PRESENT, THE WORLD HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS IN CYBERSPACE, BUT IT STILL FACES SEVERE CHALLENGES. IN THE FACE OF NEW SITUATIONS AND NEW MEASURES, IT IS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN LEGISLATION, IMPROVE RELEVANT SYSTEMS, AND STRENGTHEN SUPERVISION CAPACITY. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH PERFECT TECHNICAL MEANS AND SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT THIS GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED.
162	IN MCGIRT V. OKLAHOMA, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT FOUND THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MUSCOGEE (CREEK) NATION, WHICH WERE SET IN 1866 AND WHICH ENCOMPASS A LARGE SWATH OF PRESENT-DAY OKLAHOMA, REMAIN INTACT. ALTHOUGH NON-INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HAD SETTLED ON THE LAND IN DROVES BY THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE COURT HELD THAT THE LAND REMAINS "INDIAN COUNTRY" UNTIL CONGRESS EXPLICITLY INDICATES OTHERWISE. BECAUSE CONGRESS NEVER SO INDICATED, THE RESERVATION IS UNDIMINISHED. MCGIRT MARKED A MASSIVE SHIFT IN THE COURT'S APPROACH TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER RESERVATION BOUNDARIES REMAIN IN FORCE; DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY HAD PREVIOUSLY FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN THE COURT'S RULINGS IN THIS ARENA. THE COURT HAS RELIED ON SIMILAR HISTORICAL EVIDENCE TO INFORM ITS ANALYSIS OF A CLOSELY RELATED SET OF QUESTIONS: THOSE PERTAINING TO WHETHER INDIGENOUS NATIONS' SOVEREIGN POWERS OVER THEIR RESERVATIONS EXTEND TO NON-INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT MCGIRT'S REPUDIATION OF A CONTEXT-DRIVEN INQUIRY IN THE FORMER LINE OF CASES HAS RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE LATTER. IN PARTICULAR, THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT THE TYPES OF EVIDENCE AND THE MODES OF REASONING THAT MCGIRT REJECTS HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO THE COURT'S DOCTRINE OF "IMPLICIT DIVESTITURE," WHICH HOLDS THAT INDIGENOUS NATIONS HAVE LIMITED AUTHORITY OVER NON-INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ON RESERVATIONS. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT MCGIRT AND IMPLICIT DIVESTITURE ARE INCOMPATIBLE. THIS NOTE CONCLUDES THAT THE COURT, HAVING UNDERMINED ITS THEORY OF IMPLICIT DIVESTITURE, SHOULD APPLY MCGIRT'S MODE OF ANALYSIS TO QUESTIONS INVOLVING INDIGENOUS NATIONS' TERRITORIAL AUTHORITY OVER RESERVATIONS.
163	WHAT INTERPRETATIVE ROLE CAN THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) NORMS PLAY IN THE CURRENT DISCUSSION ON THE GLOBALIZATION OF LAW IN GENERAL? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THE ARTICLE FIRSTLY HIGHLIGHTS FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE THE FRAGMENTARY EFFECTS OF THE PHENOMENA OF GLOBALIZATION ON LAW IN GENERAL TO SET THE DISCURSIVE PLAYING FIELD. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE AUTHOR SHOWS POTENTIAL NORMATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL ANSWERS PROVIDED BY IHL ON THE TRULY GLOBAL PHENOMENON OF ARMED CONFLICTS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND NORMATIVE REINTERPRETATIONS OF IHL NORMS IN THE INTERDEPENDENT SYSTEM OF CUSTOMARY RULES AND TREATY-BASED RULES, THE ARTICLE DRAWS A LINE OF RECEPTION FROM THE NORMS OF THE ST. PETERSBURG DECLARATION (1868) TO THE INFLUENTIAL CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (2005) AND RECENT IHL CONVENTIONS SUCH AS THE CONVENTION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS (2008). THEREBY, A SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE BROAD GLOBAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE RELEVANT IHL NORMS DESPITE ITS RATHER WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS.
164	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF A US LAW, CALLED ALIEN TORT STATUTE (ATS), ON THE OVERSEAS OPERATIONS OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WITH REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THE LAW HAS THE POTENTIAL OF CREATING SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND OPERATIONAL RISKS FOR THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (MNCS) BY ALLOWING FOREIGN CITIZENS TO BRING CASES IN THE US COURTS FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER REVIEWS THE RELEVANT CASE LAW AND THE DECISIONS OF THE US HIGHEST COURT IN OUTLINING THE EXPANDING SCOPE OF CORPORATE CULPABILITY AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY. FINDINGS - THE PAPER UNDERTAKES A CAREFUL CRITIQUE OF THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE MNCS AS TO THE SCOPE AND REACH OF THE LAW. IT CONCLUDES THAT THESE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT TENABLE IN TERMS OF MNCS' OWN PROFESSED COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. IT ALSO FINDS THAT THE LAW'S INTENT AS INTERPRETED IN VARIOUS DECISIONS OF THE US FEDERAL COURTS HAS LED TO FURTHER CLARITY AND SPECIFICITY AS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE MNCS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - MNCS MUST TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR OVERSEAS OPERATIONS ARE NOT IMPLICATED IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. SPECIFIC APPROACHES ARE SUGGESTED TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW.
165	THE INVESTIGATION REVEALS SHORTCOMINGS IN THE ARGUMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE ON THE RECOGNITION OF ARTICLE 366-1 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE AS NOT BEING IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION, IN TERMS OF:(A) THE COURT'S LACK OF AUTHORITY TO CRIMINALIZE SOCIALLY DANGEROUS ACTS; (B) LACK OF ARGUMENTATION ON THE ABSENCE OF SOCIAL HARM IN THE NON-SUBMISSION OF A DECLARATION AND IN THE PRESENTATION OF INACCURATE INFORMATION; (C) POSITIVE FOREIGN EXPERIENCE; (D) CONFORMITY OF ARTICLE 366-1 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF UKRAINE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE EMPLOYS A SET OF LEGAL RESEARCH METHODS, INCLUDING TERMINOLOGICAL, SYSTEMIC-STRUCTURAL, FORMALLOGICAL, AND COMPARATIVE-LEGAL. IT IS STRESSED THAT:(A) THE CRIMINALIZATION OF A SOCIALLY HARMFUL ACT IS A MATTER FOR THE LEGISLATOR, NOT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE, TO DECIDE; (B) THE DECISION DOES NOT PRESENT OR REFUTE ANY ARGUMENT ON THE ELEMENT OF SOCIAL HARMFULNESS RELATING TO THE NON-SUBMISSION OF A DECLARATION AND THE DECLARATION OF INACCURATE INFORMATION. ON THE BASIS OF THE INVESTIGATION, IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE DECISION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ON THE RECOGNITION OF ARTICLE 366-1 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY SUBSTANTIATED.
166	THE COMPARISON OF THE LAW ON INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AND THE LAW ON THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA WITH THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, DOCUMENT 8301 AND THE RECOMMENDATION 1402 OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE OF 26 APRIL 1999 HAS SHOWN PARTIAL HARMONISATION OF THE LEGISLATION REGULATING THE CROATIAN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM WITH EUROPEAN DOCUMENTS. THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE CHOSEN MODEL OF THE CROATIAN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM, POINTS OUT SOLUTIONS TO CERTAIN PROBLEMS, AND SUGGESTS A MODEL THAT WOULD MANAGE TO ACHIEVE THE MAIN PRINCIPLES - THE RULE OF LAW, LEGALITY, POLITICAL IMPARTIALITY, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS.
167	AIM. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE MEDIATION PRINCIPLES AND FEATURES OF THEIR APPLICATION IN THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF UKRAINE. METHODS. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF ENACTED REGULATIONS AND THEIR COMPARISON IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE STUDY OF LITERATURE, INCLUDING WORKS BY AUTHORS OF BOTH LEGAL AND OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES WHERE MEDIATION IS USED AS A MEANS OF COMPROMISE, INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGY, MEDICINE, ECOLOGY, ALONG WITH THE USE OF TOOLS AND COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE STUDY OF LAW. TO STUDY THE PROSPECTS AND EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF MEDIATION PRINCIPLES IN THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, SOCIOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS. THE RESULTS OF STUDY SHOWED THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDIATION PRINCIPLES ARE APPLIED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PECULIARITIES OF NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. NOTWITHSTANDING, SUCH PRINCIPLES AS THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY (EQUAL RIGHTS) OF THE PARTIES, THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLUNTARINESS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND MEDIATOR BEHAVIOUR (INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY, TRUST AND JUSTICE) ARE APPLIED IN MOST OF THE STUDIED NATIONAL MODELS OF MEDIATION, CONSEQUENTLY THEY CAN BE CALLED FUNDAMENTAL. THE SURVEY RESULTS HAVE REVEALED THE READINESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT TO INTRODUCE MEDIATION AS A TOOL FOR RESOLVING CONFLICTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. CONCLUSIONS. THE SPECIFICS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDIATION PRINCIPLES IN UKRAINE AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH.
168	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE VENICE COMMISSION TO THE "EUROPEAN COMMON HERITAGE", A NOTION WHICH WAS INTRODUCED ESPECIALLY FOR HELPING THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY. ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE EXAMPLES OF THE VENICE COMMISSION'S WORK IS THE CODE OF GOOD PRACTICES IN ELECTORAL MATTERS WHICH HAS HAD A STRONG IMPACT ON THE LEGISLATION OF SEVERAL STATES AND ON MANY DECISIONS TAKEN BY INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THE PAPER COMPARES TWO DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO THE REPORTS AND OPINIONS OF THE VENICE COMMISSION. FIRSTLY, THE ARTICLE STUDIES THE RESPONSE TO THE OPINION ON THE SPANISH ORGANIC LAW 15/2015 WHICH GAVE NEW POWERS OF EXECUTION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THE OPINION DID NOT LEAD TO A CHANGE IN THE LAW, ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE GUIDED THE REACTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN THE CRISIS WITH CATALONIA. SECONDLY, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE HIGH DEGREE OF INFLUENCE OF THE VENICE COMMISSION ON THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS FOLLOWED THE VENICE COMMISSION'S OPINIONS TO CONFRONT THE INFRINGEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND.
169	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON HOW THE CONTROL OF THE JUDICIARY OVER THE LEGISLATURE HAS INCREASED IN THE LAST DECADES AND THE REASONS FOR ALTERED BALANCE OF POWERS IN THE ICELANDIC CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM ARE EXPLORED. EARLIER THEORIES OF PARLIAMENTARY PRECEDENCE OVER OTHER BRANCHES OF STATE POWER ARE IN TRANSITION. THERE IS A GROWING TREND TOWARDS THE BALANCING OF POWERS, IN WHICH THE COURTS MONITOR THAT LEGISLATION COMPLIES WITH THE CONSTITUTION. A COMPARISON IS MADE WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS OF DENMARK AND NORWAY WHICH POINTS AT THE SAME DIRECTION. THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN 1995 HAVE AFFECTED THE INTERPRETATION METHODS OF THE ICELANDIC COURTS AND STRENGTHENED THEIR SUPERVISORY ROLE. IDEAS UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE REMEDIES FOR INDIVIDUALS ARE PREVAILING OVER THE IDEA OF PREFERRED POSITION OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER VIS-A-VIS THE JUDICIARY. THE COURTS SEE IT AS A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ADJUDICATE WHETHER A LEGISLATIVE ACT CONFORMS WITH CONSTITUTIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THE SUPREME COURT OF ICELAND HAS REFERRED TO THE WIDE DISCRETION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE FIELD OF FISCAL POWERS, SUCH AS REGARDING TAXATION AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. HOWEVER, EVEN WHERE LEGISLATION AIMS AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL POLICIES, THE DISCRETION OF ALTHINGI IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITS. THE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL CONTROL REQUIRES THAT ALTHINGI MUST ASSESS CAREFULLY WHETHER LEGISLATION WHICH LIMITS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED HUMAN RIGHTS CONFORMS WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY.
170	POOR PEOPLE ARE OFTEN DENIED ACCESS TO THE COURTS DUE TO EXPENSIVE LEGAL FEES. PREVENTING FREE ACCESS TO JUSTICE VIOLATES A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE AND UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL NORMS. THE RECOGNITION OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW AS OUTCOMES AND FACILITATORS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE 2030 AGENDA. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT PROVIDING AFFORDABLE AND TIMELY ACCESS TO JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS AND LEGAL AID SERVICES WILL HELP ACHIEVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) 16 TARGETS OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS. INDIAN LAW SCHOOL CLINICS HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIZED CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION. THE ADVOCATES ACT OF 1961 REQUIRES AN AMENDMENT TO ALLOW LAW STUDENTS AND FACULTY TO REPRESENT PRO BONO CLIENTS. THE STUDY INFERS THAT COMPLETELY INSTITUTIONALIZING THE LAW SCHOOL LEGAL AID CLINICS AS PART OF CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION IS A POWERFUL PLATFORM TO PROMOTE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO ALL.
171	THE PREVAILING VIEW IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PRACTICE IS THAT A STATE DOES NOT WAIVE ITS IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION BY MERELY CONSENTING TO ARBITRATION. YET, IN THE CONTEXT OF ARBITRATION BETWEEN STATES AND PRIVATE PARTIES, EXECUTION IMMUNITIES HAVE EMERGED AS A VERY SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARBITRAL AWARDS. WHEN IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION ALLOWS STATES TO ESCAPE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE FREELY UNDERTAKEN, AND WHEN IT WITHHOLDS FROM CLAIMANTS THE FRUITS OF A FAVOURABLE AWARD, THE BENEFITS OF ARBITRATION BECOME ILLUSORY. THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE PREVAILING VIEW IS NO LONGER COMPELLING BECAUSE, IN THE CONTEXT OF ARBITRATION, DEFERENCE TO STATE IMMUNITY IS MISPLACED AND IMPOSES AN UNJUSTIFIED LIMIT ON THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE THE PRESUMPTIVE EFFECT OF WAIVING IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION. THE PROPOSED WAIVER MAY BE VIEWED AS FOLLOWING FROM THE OBLIGATION THAT THE SOVEREIGN VOLUNTARILY UNDERTAKES WHEN SUBMITTING TO ARBITRATION, AND TRACKS THE NORMATIVE EVOLUTION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THE DOCTRINE OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND ARBITRATION LAW.
172	CAN A CONSTITUTIONAL NORM BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL? THIS IDEA SEEMS, AT FIRST SIGHT AS A SELF-CONTRADICTION. UNCONSTITUTIONALITY IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO THOSE ORDINARY LAWS, INFERIOR TO THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH VIOLATE IT. CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, IN CONTRAST, CARRY AN EQUAL NORMATIVE STATUS AS THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF AND OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS. THE QUESTION OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS RECENTLY AROSE IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. ON 10 SEPTEMBER 2009, THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL ACT NO 195/2009 COLL, ON SHORTENING THE FIFTH TERM OF OFFICE OF THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HELD THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT WAS AN INDIVIDUAL, SPECIFIC DECISION AND RETROACTIVE, THUS VIOLATING THE UNAMENDABILITY PROVISION (ART 9( 2)) IN THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH PROHIBITS AMENDMENTS TO THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S DECISION IN A BROADER COMPARATIVE AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE AND FOCUSES, MAINLY, ON FOUR ISSUES: FIRST, THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S AUTHORITY TO SUBSTANTIVELY REVIEW CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS; SECOND, THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF REVIEW WHEN EXERCISING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS; THIRD, THE 'INDIVIDUAL, SPECIFIC' CHARACTER OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT; AND FOURTH, ITS ALLEGED RETROACTIVE APPLICATION. THE ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT WHILE THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WAS GENERALLY CORRECT IN CLAIMING AN AUTHORITY TO SUBSTANTIVELY REVIEW EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, THIS WAS NOT THE APPROPRIATE CASE IN WHICH TO ANNUL A CONSTITUTIONAL ACT.
173	THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE IN A BROAD SENSE, THE RIGHT TO A REAL REMEDY AND RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY JUDICIAL REVIEW, CONSTITUTES A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT OF A EUROPEAN UNION BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW AND MUTUAL RECOGNITION AS WELL AS A COUNCIL OF EUROPE WILLING TO GUARANTEE THE JURISDICTION OF STANDARDS OF PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (EQUIVALENT PROTECTION). HOWEVER, THE GLOBAL RISKS OF TODAY'S SOCIETY AND THE NEED FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE (SOMETIMES MORE THAN EFFICIENT) INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ARE OPENING FISSURES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RIGHT OF DEFENSE, CAUSING A DOUBLE NEGATIVE EFFECT: THE WEAKENING OF EUROPEAN IDENTITY AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF THE ATTACKS GENERATED BY NATIONALIST AND EUROSCEPTIC PHENOMENA
174	INTRODUCTION: THE ARTICLE PROVIDES THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE CONCEPT "LEGAL FORM" IN FAMILY LAW. IT IS NOTED THAT THE LEGAL FORM HAS ALREADY BEEN DEFINED BY RULE OF LAW AND THE DEVELOPED FAMILY RELATIONS IN SOCIETY, BUT SO FAR THE LEGAL FORM AS AN ELEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC COGNITION OF FAMILY LAW HAS NOT ATTRACTED ATTENTION OF SCIENTISTS. PURPOSE: TO CONSIDER THE LEGAL FORM IN FAMILY LAW APPLYING SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS IN CIVIL LAW. TO PRESENT THE AUTHOR'S DEFINITION OF THE LEGAL FORM AS A GENERAL CONCEPT AND OF THE LEGAL FORM OF A SUBJECT'S ACTIVITY AS A SPECIAL CONCEPT. METHODS: SOME METHODS OF FORMAL LOGIC - ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION, IN THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXTRAPOLATION, ARGUMENTATION, GENERALIZATION, ANALOGY HAVE BEEN USED. RESULTS: WITH THE HELP OF THESE METHODS, THE LEGAL FORM IS DEFINED AND IDENTIFIED IN FAMILY LAW. THE AUTHORS HAVE MANAGED TO UNITE THE DOCTRINES WHICH ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE IN CIVIL LAW CONCERNING THE LEGAL FORM AND TO MAKE INDEPENDENT CONCLUSIONS WITHIN THE BRANCH OF FAMILY LAW. THUS, THE AUTHORS FOCUS, FIRST OF ALL, ON TYPES OF THE LEGAL FORM, THEIR FEATURES, AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE LEGAL FORM IN CIVIL AND FAMILY LAW. CONCLUSIONS: THE DATA RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH CAN BE TAKEN AS A BASIS FOR THE THEORY OF THE LEGAL FORM IN FAMILY LAW.
175	THE PAPER IS DEVOTED TO THE SOCIOLOGICAL TURN IN LAW STUDIES IN RUSSIA. THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW IS A NEW CONCEPT FOR THE RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGY AND IS NOT WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A DISCIPLINE WITH OWN DEVELOPED THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH METHODS. ONE OF THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE NEW SOCIOLOGY OF LAW IN RUSSIA WAS THE CREATION IN 2009 OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW (IRL) IN THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY AT SAINT PETERSBURG. THE MISSION OF THE INSTITUTE IS TO FACILITATE JUDICIAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT REFORMS AND TO UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA. THIS GOAL IS PURSUED BY MEANS OF ACADEMIC AND POLICY-ORIENTED STUDY CONDUCTED WITHIN THE RESEARCH TRADITION KNOWN AS LAW AND SOCIETY, WHICH IS WAY BEYOND PURE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW AND TAKES ADVANTAGE OF RELATED DISCIPLINES, SUCH AS ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY, NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS, LAW AND ECONOMICS, POLITICAL SCIENCE AND OTHERS. IN THE BRIEF OVERVIEW, THE AUTHOR ADDRESSES FOUR MOST INTERESTING AREAS OF STUDIES. FIRST, IT REFERS TO EXTRA-LEGAL INFLUENCES ON COURT DECISIONS THAT CAN RESULT IN REGULARITIES IMPLICIT IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS IN ARBITRATION AND CIVIC COURTS IN RUSSIA. SECOND, IT PROVIDES SOCIOLOGICAL VIEWS ON JUDGES AS A PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY. THIRD, IT PROPOSES AN INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAT ARE OVERWHELMINGLY BIASED TOWARDS PROSECUTION. FOURTH, IT DISCUSSES ISSUES OF COPYRIGHT LAW AND ITS IMPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY UNDER FASTER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES. REVIEWING THE FOURTH RESEARCH AREAS, THE AUTHOR DEMONSTRATES HOW SOCIOLOGISTS CHALLENGE THIS AUTONOMY OF LAW AND STUDY EXTERNAL SOCIAL INFLUENCES. THUS, THEY SHOWS "LAW IN ACTION" IN A REAL SOCIETY.
176	THE WAR IN UKRAINE HAS DRAGGED ON SINCE 2014, CAUSING AN UNPRECEDENTED HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, LOSS OF LIFE AND SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE REGION. HOWEVER, ITS EFFECTS HAVE NOT BEEN LIMITED TO UKRAINE ALONE: THE IMPACT OF THE WAR ON EU LAW AND POLICY HAS BEEN PROFOUND AND FAR-REACHING, AS THE EU HAS CONTINUED TO BASE ITS RESPONSE ON LAW AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES ARISING FROM THE WAR. IN THIS CONTEXT, SANCTIONS REPRESENT ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO ADDRESS RUSSIA'S AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE, BUT ALSO ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX, AS THEIR DESIGN, ADOPTION AND ENFORCEMENT RAISE NUMEROUS LEGAL ISSUES. THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE BASIC LEGAL REGIME APPLICABLE TO SANCTIONS AND HOW THE EU IS ADDRESSING, ON THE BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE LEGAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR APPLICATION.
177	THIS ARTICLE GRAPPLES WITH THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF THE PAST IN ROMANIA, IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF "JUDICIAL LUSTRATION" MEASURES. IT ARGUES THAT DECOMMUNIZATION AND LUSTRATION POLICIES, WHICH COULD NOT BE PURSUED IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE COLLAPSE OF STATE SOCIALISM IN 1989, WERE WEAPONIZED MUCH LATER AND USED IN ORDER TO ADVANCE OTHER PURPOSES. IN 2006, AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL VETTING PROCEDURE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EU-DRIVEN FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, WAS REPURPOSED BY THE CENTER-RIGHT AS A LUSTRATION INSTRUMENT. IN THE SAME YEAR, THE DISMANTLING OF AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE CREATED AFTER 1991 IN THE JUSTICE MINISTRY (SIPA) TO MONITOR 'VULNERABILITIES' IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS SET IN MOTION A LONG SERIES OF FAILED ATTEMPTS TO BRING CLOSURE TO THE QUESTION REGARDING THE SERVICE'S ARCHIVES, FOMENTING CONTINUITIES OF SUSPICION UNTIL TODAY. MORE RECENTLY, IN 2018, A FORM OF 'MOCK-JUDICIAL LUSTRATION' HAS BEEN USED BY THE POLITICAL LEFT TO DEFLECT OR AT LEAST DELEGITIMIZE REPRESSIVE ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES. THE NEW "LUSTRATION PROCEDURE" IMPLICITLY EQUATED THE RECENT COOPERATION BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, WITH PAST PRACTICES OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE COMMUNIST SECURITATE. THESE THREE EPISODES OF 'DEALING WITH THE PAST' ARE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO SHOWCASE PATH-DEPENDENCIES. SUCH PATH-DEPENDENCIES ARE NOT LINKED ONLY WITH CARRYOVERS FROM OR THROWBACKS TO THE COMMUNIST PAST. RATHER, PRE- AND POST-COMMUNIST DEFICIENCIES OF MODERNIZATION, COMBINED MORE RECENTLY WITH GAPS IN POST-ACCESSION MONITORING BY THE EU COMMISSION, CREATE CONTINUITIES OF PERIPHERAL INSTRUMENTALISM. VARIOUS NARRATIVES, SUCH AS DECOMMUNIZATION, THE FIGHT AGAINST GRAFT, JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE USED TO LEGITIMIZE SHORT-TERM CONSEQUENTIALISM, EVINCING A RESILIENT, STRUCTURAL RESISTANCE TO LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL NORMATIVITY.
178	HOW DOES FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION INFLUENCE FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND THE PROBABILITY OF A FISCAL CRISIS? DISCRETE CHOICE ANALYSIS USED WITH PANEL DATA REVEALS THAT CRISIS PROBABILITY IS ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY WITH SPENDING DECENTRALIZATION AND NEGATIVELY WITH VERTICAL FISCAL IMBALANCE. THESE EFFECTS ARE PREVALENT IN COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF TAX REVENUE DECENTRALIZATION, WHILE A STRONGER RULE OF LAW MITIGATES SUCH ADVERSE DECENTRALIZATION EFFECTS. THE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT REDUCED RISK SHARING AGAINST LOCAL SHOCKS UNDER TAX REVENUE DECENTRALIZATION DESTABILIZES THE SUSTAINABILITY OF A NATION'S FISCAL SYSTEM. THEREFORE, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD BE COGNIZANT OF THE UNDESIRABLE IMPACTS OF DECENTRALIZATION ON FISCAL CRISIS AND INDISCIPLINE.
179	THE CURRENT PAPER IS HEAVILY INDEBTED TO STEVEN PINKER'S THEORY OF LEVIATHAN. HE MADE INGENIOUS THEORETICAL AND HISTORICAL USE OF THE ONE-OFF PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAME (=THE PACIFIST'S DILEMMA GAME) AND DEMONSTRATED HOW THE STATE, AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS FOR CONTROLLING VIOLENCE, SOLVES THE HOBBESIAN PROBLEM OF ANARCHY. WE ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT CENTRALIZED AUTHORITARIAN SOLUTIONS TO THE PACIFIST'S DILEMMA GAME CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM A FEW, SPECIFIABLE PROBLEMS THAT CAUSE POLITICAL VIOLENCE, AND CITIZENS' VIOLENCE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, AND THAT DECENTRALIZED COOPERATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE PACIFIST'S DILEMMA GAME, ARISING FROM ITERATED SOLUTION CONCEPTS, ARE CAPABLE OF SOLVING THESE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS. A DECENTRALIZED COOPERATIVE SOLUTION TO THE PACIFIST'S DILEMMA GAME, WITHOUT THE SOVEREIGN, IS NOT ONLY A FEASIBLE, BUT, ALSO, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AN EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE EQUILIBRIUM. THERE ARE SEVERAL THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS THAT HAVE REACHED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME CONCLUSION. THESE INCLUDE THE FOLK THEOREM BY ROBERT AUMANN, THE THEORY OF RECIPROCAL ALTRUISM BY ROBERT TRIVERS, AND THE STRATEGIC SIMULATIONS AND MODELS OF THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION BY ROBERT AXELROD AND WILLIAM D. HAMILTON. CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, BASED ON CITIZENS' EQUAL POLITICAL RIGHTS AND ON THE RULE OF LAW, INCORPORATES SOME OF THE KEY LOGICAL COMPONENTS OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED MODELS OF DECENTRALIZED COOPERATION. IT IS NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, AS SUCH, BUT IT DOES SOLVE SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND INSTABILITY THAT HAVE PLAGUED CENTRALIZED AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT. THE PAPER THUS PROVIDES A NEW THEORETICAL OUTLOOK UPON THE PACIFYING EFFECTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
180	WITH THE RISE OF DEEPFAKES AND SYNTHETIC MEDIA, THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AND POLITIZED. DEEPFAKES CAN BE USED TO SPREAD FAKE NEWS, INFLUENCE ELECTIONS, INTRODUCE HIGHLY REALISTIC FAKE EVIDENCE IN COURTS AND MAKE FAKE PORNO MOVIES. EACH OF THESE APPLICATIONS POTENTIALLY HAS A BIG IMPACT ON SOCIETY, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE QUESTION THIS ARTICLE SHALL ASSESS IS WHETHER THE CURRENT REGULATORY REGIME SUFFICES TO ADDRESS THESE POTENTIAL HARMS AND IF NOT, WHICH ADDITIONAL RULES AND PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE ADOPTED. IT WILL DISCUSS SEVERAL POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION REGIME, LIMITATIONS TO THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND EX ANTE RULES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF USE OF DEEPFAKE-TECHNOLOGIES.

181	THIS PIECE REFLECTS RATHER ADMIRINGLY ON THE METHODS AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF MARTIN KRYGIER'S VARIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT EXAMINES HIS USE OF THE IDEA OF THE TELOS OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONTRASTING IT WITH THE APPROACHES OF THEORISTS WHO SEEK TO ANALYSE THE ESSENCE OR 'ANATOMY' OF THE RULE OF LAW IDEA OR OF LAW ITSELF. IT THEN EXAMINES HIS NOTION OF HOW THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE TEMPERING OF POWER. LARGELY AGREEING WITH KRYGIER'S CONCEPTION, THE ESSAY NEVERTHELESS SUGGESTS THAT THE PROJECT MIGHT BE IMPROVED BY FOCUSING ON THE TELOS OR SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF LAW RATHER THAN THOSE CLAIMED TO BE IMMANENT IN THE RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO NUDGES KRYGIER TO DEEPEN THE METAPHOR OF TEMPERING BY CLARIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER KEY CONCEPTS SUCH AS LIBERTY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRACY.
182	ABOLISHING THE PROMOTION OF THE NORMS OF MODERN RUSSIAN LAW ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE CITIZENS TO FOLLOW AN ACCEPTABLE FOR SOCIETY AND STATE BEHAVIOR. THE LACK OF A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THE NOTION OF "DEPOTATORY NORM OF LAW", AS WELL AS THE INSUFFICIENT THEORETICAL ELABORATION OF THE FEATURES LAID DOWN IN ITS BASIS, PUTS THE LEGISLATOR IN A DIFFICULT POSITION IN FORMULATING THE ABOLITION OF PROMOTION OF LEGAL NORMS, AND ALSO IN THE COURSE OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.
183	SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY ATTRIBUTES TO THE STATE THE ROLE OF "GUARANTOR" OR "PROTECTOR" AGAINST THE SOCIAL VIOLENCE IT IS MEANT TO PACIFY. WE MUST, HOWEVER, DISTINGUISH ON THIS MATTER BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT THEORISTS OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. THE MOST DIFFICULT COMPARISON TO MAKE, BUT ALSO THE MOST ENLIGHTENING ONE, IS THAT BETWEEN HOBBES AND ROUSSEAU. ROUSSEAU CRITICIZES HOBBES, BUT OFTEN INSPIRES HIMSELF FROM HIM, AND IN PARTICULAR IN HIS THEORY OF SOVEREIGNTY. THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO AUTHORS USUALLY BEARS ON THE MATTER OF THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. OUR APPROACH WILL BE TO SHIFT THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THIS QUESTION BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RECENT STUDIES ON THE MATTER OF WAR IN ROUSSEAU. IT IS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ORIGINS AND THE NATURE OF VIOLENCE THAT THE ESSENTIAL CHIASM BETWEEN THE TWO AUTHORS OCCURS. FOR HOBBES, THE STATE AND THE LAW PUT AN END TO A VIOLENCE THAT PRE-EXISTS THEM AND THAT RISES AS SOON AS MAN MEETS MAN. FOR ROUSSEAU, VIOLENCE AND CONFLICT HAVE AS THEIR FIRST POINT OF ORIGIN THE STABILIZATION, BY THE STATE AND THE LAW, OF THE UNEVEN AND COMPETITIVE SOCIAL STATUSES. HENCE THE INTIMATE TENSION WHICH RUNS THROUGHOUT ROUSSEAU'S WORK REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE STATE. DEPENDING ON ITS END AND THE TERMS OF ITS INSTITUTIONS, IT CAN EQUALLY WELL BE DESCRIBED AS A DOMINATING POWER OR A MEANS OF EMANCIPATION AND HARMONIZATION OF DIVERGENT INTERESTS.
184	THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT AN OUTLINE OF THE VIEWS OF THE POLISH LEGAL THEORIST JOZEF NOWACKI (1923-2005). THE CLAIM PUT FORWARD IS THAT NOWACKI WAS THE CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE OF HANS KELSEN'S NORMATIVISM IN POLISH LEGAL THEORY. THE PAPER BEGINS WITH A SHORT HISTORICAL SKETCH PRESENTING THE RECEPTION OF HANS KELSEN'S VIEWS IN POLISH JURISPRUDENCE, NOTING THAT IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD THE COMMUNIST AUTHORITIES BELIEVED THAT NORMATIVISM WAS AT ODDS WITH THE THEN PREVAILING SYSTEM OF ACTUALLY EXISTING SOCIALISM. DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM GERMAN-SPEAKING AUTHORS, NOWACKI REJECTED THE IDEOLOGY PREVAILING IN POLAND AT THAT TIME AND BECAME A STAUNCH ADVOCATE OF THE NORMATIVIST STANCE, IN PARTICULAR WITH REGARD TO THE THEORY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE SECOND PART OF THE PAPER DISCUSSES NOWACKI'S VIEWS REGARDING THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE THIRD AND LAST PART PRESENTS NOWACKI'S CRITIQUE OF THE CASE-LAW OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
185	THE ATTITUDE OF PAST UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATIONS TO PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, PARTICULARLY BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNING THE USE OF FORCE, HAS OFTEN SEEMED AMBIVALENT, OR SOMETIMES DECIDEDLY HOSTILE (WHERE THE CONDUCT OF THE UNITED STATES ITSELF WAS CALLED IN TO QUESTION). THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE ATTITUDE OF MANY OF THOSE WITH POWER OR INFLUENCE IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION (PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE 'NEO-CONSERVATIVES'), AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR OFTEN THINLY DISGUISED CONTEMPT FOR PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH MIGHT SEEK TO CONSTRAIN THE EXERCISE OF UNITED STATES POWER. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT WHILE THE ACADEMIC ARGUMENTS WHICH SEEK TO JUSTIFY THIS AMERICAN 'EXCEPTIONALISM' ARE WORTHY OF SERIOUS EXAMINATION, THEY ARE ULTIMATELY INADEQUATE AND IN THE INTERESTS OF NEITHER THE REST OF THE WORLD, NOR, FINALLY, THE UNITED STATES ITSELF.
186	THE SOCIOLEGAL COMPLIANCE LITERATURE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT COMPLIANCE IS MOTIVATED BY FEAR, DUTY, OR SOCIAL LICENSE PRESSURE, RELIES ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE OFTEN SPECIFIC TO THE DEVELOPED WORLD. ARE DEVELOPING WORLD CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW STATE CAPACITY, NOT CONDUCIVE TO REGULATORY COMPLIANCE? ALONG THE OPEN INDIA-NEPAL BORDER, I EXAMINE VARIATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH WOOD-TAKING REGULATIONS IN CONTIGUOUS CONSERVATION AREAS LOCATED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I FIND THAT WIDESPREAD POVERTY, WHICH MAKES THE COST OF COMPLIANCE FOR LARGE SWATHS OF THE POPULATION EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES COMPLIANCE RATES. I GO ON TO SHOW THAT THERE ARE POLICIES THAT EVEN CASH-STRAPPED, WEAKLY-INSTITUTIONALIZED STATES CAN ADOPT THAT MAKE COMPLIANCE MORE AFFORDABLE. THESE POLICIES, AND THE RESULTING PROGRAMS, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPLIANCE.
187	JUDGES INCREASINGLY ALTER OR VETO GOVERNMENT DECISIONS. THE AIM IS TO EXPLAIN THIS `JUDICIALIZATION' OF BRITISH POLITICS. EXISTING THEORIES FOCUS ON WHAT THE JUDGES' WANT FOR THEMSELVES, OR THEY FOCUS ON CHANGES TO SOCIAL ATTITUDES. BUT A KEY VARIABLE, OFTEN OMITTED IN RESEARCH, IS THE LAW ITSELF. IF THE MEANING OF LAW IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WE SHOULD EXPECT A GREATER ROLE FOR ADJUDICATION IN POLITICS. A DESCRIPTIVE TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF 8278 SECTIONS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LEGISLATION BETWEEN 1920 AND 2010 DEMONSTRATES A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INDETERMINATE LANGUAGE USED BY PARLIAMENT TO COMMUNICATE WITH GOVERNMENT AND THE COURTS. THIS INCLUDES POLICY SPACES WITH HIGH JUDICIALIZATION: IMMIGRATION, HOMELESSNESS AND ANTI-DISCRIMINATION.
188	IN 2013 THE NETHERLANDS LOST ITS STANDARD BEARER IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF ILLNESS, PIETER HENDRIK KOOIJMANS DIED AT THE AGE OF 79 ON 13 FEBRUARY 2013. SOME TIME BEFORE HIS ILLNESS THE AUTHOR HAD AN EXTENSIVE AND FRANK INTERVIEW WITH JUDGE KOOIJMANS WHO REFLECTED ON HIS LIFE AND WORK, ESPECIALLY ON HIS INTELLECTUAL FORMATION, HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESSENCE AND CORE FUNCTIONS OF LAW, HIS EXPERIENCES AS UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE, HIS IDEAS ON REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, AND THE GREAT CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS PORTRAIT SHOWS A FINE MAN WITH A STRONG SENSE OF JUSTICE WHO WAS FULLY DEDICATED TO THE SUBSTANCE OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW WITHOUT TURNING A BLIND EYE TO ITS SHORTCOMINGS AND RELATIVE INFLUENCE IN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. THE INTERVIEW IS PRECEDED BY AN INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUDES WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON HIS LONG AND PRODUCTIVE LIFE IN THE SERVICE OF PEACE, JUSTICE, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH THE LAW.
189	LAW IS - AND HAS LONG BEEN - A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF (POST-) COLONIAL ORDERS. IT IS COMMONPLACE WISDOM THAT THE WESTERN CENTRE DOMINATES THE EASTERN PERIPHERY, NOT ONLY THROUGH OUTRIGHT FORCE BUT ALSO VIA INSTITUTIONS AND IDEAS. EUROPEANS AND AMERICANS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BRINGING 'CIVILISATION,' BE IT CHRISTIANITY, 'MODERNITY' OR LAW, TO PEOPLES THEY PERCEIVE AS LESS CIVILISED. DESPITE THE COMMON PRACTICE OF APPLYING DIFFERENT RULES TO DIFFERENT PEOPLES, COLONISERS OFTEN SEE THE LACK OF UNIFORMITY OF LAW IN THE COLONIES AS A FAILURE, IF NOT A NECESSARY EVIL, FOR THE 'UNCIVILISED' COLONISED NATIVE. FOR COUNTRIES THAT NARROWLY ESCAPED SUBJUGATION TO EUROAMERICAN COLONIALISM, SUCH AS CHINA AND JAPAN, THE SENTIMENT OF THE HUMILIATION ENDURED WHEN BEING FORCED TO 'OPENUP' AND ADOPT WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE.
190	IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE AMBITIOUS CARBON PEAK AND NEUTRALITY TARGETS, CHINA IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVISING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT LAW. THIS STUDY IS DEVOTED TO THE PROPOSITION OF HOW TO INCORPORATE ACTIVITIES REGULATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INTO THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA). THIS STUDY IS INSPIRED BY THE EMBEDDING THEORY, WHICH PROVIDES THE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES TO BE REGULATED BY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL NORMS. THIS FRAMEWORK REQUIRES A RELEVANCE AND COST ANALYSIS OF THE THREE INDICATORS REQUIRED TO REGULATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES: ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, AND LEGAL SUPPORT. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE STRUCTURE OF CHINA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSESSMENT (GGEA) SYSTEM AND THAT OF THE EIA SYSTEM ARE CLOSELY RELATED AND THAT THE GENERATION AND TRANSACTION COSTS INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTION EMBEDDING ARE LOW. THIS RESULT SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMBEDDING THEORY FOR ACHIEVING INSTITUTIONAL COUPLING. IN CONCLUSION, THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN OUTLOOK ON THE DIRECTION OF THE REVISION OF CHINA'S EIA LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BUILDING A RULE OF LAW PATHWAY FOR GGEA WITH "4EM-3CS-3RC" AS THE CORE.
191	AIR POLLUTION BRINGS UNCOUNTABLE SERIOUS INFLUENCES ON HUMAN LIFE DURING THE LAST DECADE. THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO COMPARE ECONOMIC LIBERALISM WITH ECONOMIC FEDERALISM IN EXAMINING THE PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. ECONOMIC ANALYSTS HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS WITH ONE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT ARGUING THAT AIR POLLUTION IS THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A FREE ECONOMY RATHER THAN THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, WHILE ANOTHER SUPPORTS LIBERAL ECONOMICS AND VICE VERSA. AFTER DEVELOPING A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, THE STUDY USES THE TECHNIQUE OF FUZZY SET QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (FSQCA) TO EXAMINE HOW THE RULE OF LAW, THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, REGULATORY EFFICIENCY, AND THE OPENNESS OF THE MARKET INFLUENCE AIR POLLUTION IN COUNTRIES ACROSS THE REGION. THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES TWO SOLUTIONS WITH GOVERNMENT SIZE BEING FOUND TO BE A NECESSARY AND CORE CONDITION THAT INFLUENCES AIR POLLUTION. THE STUDY THUS PROVIDES INSIGHTS AND SUGGESTS THAT GOVERNMENT SPENDING, TAXATION, AND OTHER FINANCIAL HEALTH POLICIES CAN BE USED AS KEY SOURCES TO CONTROL AIR POLLUTION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.
192	THIS ARTICLE EXTENDS THE ENDURING DEBATE OVER THE BALANCE OF CENTRAL VERSUS LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL TO CHINA'S CORNERSTONE OF STATE COERCIVE CONTROL: THE PUBLIC SECURITY (CIVILIAN POLICE) SYSTEM. A RECENT SERIES OF STUDIES ARGUES THAT DURING THE 1990S CENTRAL AUTHORITIES MADE TERRIFIC PROGRESS IN REGAINING INFLUENCE OVER LOCAL OFFICIALS ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUE-AREAS. THIS STUDY, BY CONTRAST, ARGUES THAT EACH POLICY SECTOR IN CHINA HAS DEVELOPED ITS OWN HISTORICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SET OF "LESSONS" THAT HELP STRUCTURE POWER IN THAT SECTOR. LIKEWISE, THE PARTICULAR ISSUES IN EACH POLICY SECTOR CREATE UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR "PRINCIPALS" TRYING TO MONITOR THEIR "AGENTS." REGARDING INTERNAL SECURITY, THE HISTORICAL LESSONS THE PARTY HAS DERIVED FROM PAST SECURITY CRISES COMBINE WITH THE UNIQUELY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES OF MONITORING POLICE ACTIVITIES TO CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH LOCAL PARTY AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER OVER POLICING. THE MANY INSTITUTIONS INTENDED TO HELP CENTRAL AUTHORITIES CONTROL, OVERSEE AND MONITOR LOCAL POLICING ACTUALLY PROVIDE WEAK CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT. THESE OBSTACLES TO CENTRAL LEADERSHIP CREATE TREMENDOUS ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO BUILDING RULE BY LAW IN CHINA.
193	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES A SERIES OF ISSUES THAT ARISE IN RELATION TO THE METHODOLOGY OF CONDUCTING A CRITIQUE OF LEGAL IDEOLOGIES. IT ADDRESSES THE ATTEMPT BY THE SHEFFIELD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC LAW TO FORMULATE AND APPLY AN 'IMMANENT' MODEL OF CRITIQUE THAT BUILDS UPON THE POSITION DEVELOPED BY THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL OF CRITICAL SOCIAL THEORY. WE ADDRESS DIFFICULTIES THAT ARISE WITH THE SHEFFIELD SCHOOL'S INTERPRETATION OF THIS MODEL OF CRITIQUE, NOT LEAST THE PROBLEMS WITH ITS ATTEMPT TO APPLY A CLEAR-CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHOLLY INTERNAL, IMMANENT AND EXTERNAL MODES OF CRITIQUE. OUR OVERALL AIM IS TO FORMULATE A MORE ADEQUATE MODEL OF IDEOLOGY CRITIQUE THAT IS ABLE TO OVERCOME THE VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE DISCOVERED WITHIN THE SHEFFIELD SCHOOL'S MODEL. WE ARGUE THAT THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT RELAPSING BACK INTO THE NO LESS SERIOUS CONTRADICTIONS WHICH CAN ARISE WITH EXTERNAL MODES OF CRITIQUE. THESE MERELY SUPERIMPOSE READY-MADE CRITERIA OF ASSESSMENT UPON THE OBJECT OF THEIR ANALYSIS, WITHOUT FIRST ESTABLISHING THEIR APPROPRIATENESS.
194	PAULINE KLEINGELD ARGUES THAT ACCORDING TO KANT IT WOULD BE WRONG TO COERCE A STATE INTO AN INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION, DUE TO THE WRONGNESS OF PATERNALISM. ALTHOUGH I AGREE THAT KANT OPPOSES THE WAGING OF WAR AS A MEANS TO PEACE, I DISAGREE WITH KLEINGELD'S ACCOUNT OF THE REASONS WHY HE WOULD OPPOSE COERCING A STATE INTO A FEDERATION. SINCE SHE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE BROADER QUESTION OF THE PERMISSIBILITY OF INTERSTATE COERCION, SHE DOES NOT PROPERLY ADDRESS THE NARROWER QUESTION OF WHETHER COERCION TO COMPEL A STATE TO JOIN A FEDERATION CAN BE PERMISSIBLE. I REVISE AND SUPPLEMENT HER ARGUMENTS.
195	THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN WHY ALTHOUGH SPAIN HAS NOW A CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRATIC REGIME IT IS STILL WEAKLY AND AMBIGUOUSLY PROMOTING DEMOCRACY OR EVEN GOOD-GOVERNANCE ABROAD. RECENT EVENTS SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS MADE EVEN MORE URGENT TO CONCENTRATE ON DEMOCRATIC ASSISTANCE IN MAGHREB NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE DESPITE ITS SHORTCOMINGS MIGHT OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NON-INTRUSIVE DEMOCRATIC PROMOTION. HOWEVER, AS THE CASE OF ALGERIA SHOWS IN THE LAST 3 YEARS AND BEFORE, SPANISH FOREIGN POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION ACTORS ARE MANIFESTLY RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN SUCH A COURSE OF ACTION. OBVIOUS DEPENDENCE ON ENERGY SUPPLY (HYDROCARBONS) IS CHALLENGED AS THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS. ALTERNATIVELY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT LONG PRACTICES IN SPANISH "ARAB" FOREIGN POLICY, UNREFORMED FOREIGN SERVICE, EUROPEANIZATION OF SPAIN'S FOREIGN POLICY AND THE "SECOND TO FRANCE PLAYER SYNDROME" BEST ACCOUNT FOR SPAIN'S AMBIGUITY WITH GOVERNANCE AND ITS SLOW ABANDON OF STATUS QUO POLICIES.
196	THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES REGULATORS' INCREASING DISCRETIONARY PRACTICES IN THE INNOVATION SECTORS AND EXAMINES WHETHER INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW IS PREPARED FOR THIS SUPERVISORY EVOLUTION. AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE THREE CASES STUDIED, VERY OFTEN TECHNOLOGY LAWS THEMSELVES DO NOT ENTAIL SUFFICIENT SPECIFICATION, AND THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVILY ORIENTED TOWARD PRINCIPLES MORE SO THAN RULES TO ALLOW FOR INNOVATION. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW TO ENSURE THAT THESE 'PRINCIPLES' ARE CONSISTENTLY AND PREDICTABLY APPLIED. GATS ARTICLE VI:1WAS DESIGNED TO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN TACKLING SITUATIONS IN WHICH A GENERAL SCHEME DOES NOT MAKE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC SERVICE SUPPLIERS, BUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS SCHEME IS NOT REASONABLE, OBJECTIVE OR IMPARTIAL. THE PROVISION, HOWEVER, IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY FORCEFUL IN A MANNER THAT SAFEGUARDS DUE PROCESS AND COUNTERS THE POTENTIAL ABUSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWER.
197	THE IDEA OF THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS WITH THE LAW ON EDUCATION AIMS TO CLARIFY HOW TO MANAGE SOCIETY AND WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF EACH COUNTRY WITH DIFFERENT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF APPROACH, THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT EDUCATION LAW TO CLARIFY MONTESQUIEU'S LEGAL SPIRIT IN TERMS OF LAW. THE REPORT USES ANALYTICAL, COMPARATIVE, SYNTHESIS, AND JUSTIFICATION METHODS TO DESCRIBE THE CONTROL OF STATE POWER IN DIFFERENT STATES. MONTESQUIEU'S LEGAL THOUGHT DEMONSTRATED THE DOMINANT ABILITY OF THE LAW IN A STATE-OWNED SOCIETY TO REGULATE SOCIAL RELATIONS AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL ORDER. SO ANY FORM EDUCATES THAT. THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE EDUCATION LAW TO BE HANDLED IN EACH COUNTRY.
198	THE ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF "PERVERSION OF LAW" IN ITS THREE FIGURES: ESCAPE OF LAW, DISCRIMINATORY LEGALITY AND AUTARCHY ZONE, DISCUSSING AT LAST SIX CASES OF PERVERSION OF LAW. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT "TO PERVERT THE LAW" MEANS TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM PUBLIC CONTROL, GIVING LAWFUL APPEARANCE TO ARBITRARY ACTS. BASED ON THAT CONCEPT, THE PAPER DESCRIBES "PERVERSION OF LAW" CASES WITHIN CTNBIO, SPORTS LAW, FISCAL POLICY, CITY LAW, TAX SECRECY AND INTERNSHIP WORK.
199	ANARCHISM OFTEN SETS ITSELF AGAINST THE LAW. HOWEVER, THE ALTERNATIVE VISION ADVANCED BY ANARCHISM FACES THEORETICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER, CASE STUDIES OF ANARCHIST COMMUNITIES REVEAL PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES, AND RESORT TO THE VERY BEHAVIOUR FOR WHICH ANARCHISM CRITICISES THE LAW. NEVERTHELESS, THE VALUES INHERENT IN LAW ARE STRONGLY ALIGNED WITH THOSE CHAMPIONED BY ANARCHISM. ULTIMATELY, LAW AND ANARCHISM NEED NOT BE ANTITHETICAL; THEY CAN BE MUTUALLY HELPFUL.
200	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO REFLECT ABOUT THE REVITALIZATION, NOWADAYS, OF THE DISCOURSE JUSTIFYING TORTURE IN CERTAIN FIELDS OF THE POLITICAL THOUGHT AND THE LEGAL PRACTISE. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE BASIC ASPECTS OF THE DOCTRINE THAT, SINCE THE SUBLIMATION OF THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL POSITION OF THE CHIEF OF EXECUTIVE POWER IN THE NEW EMPIRE, DEVELOPS AN STRATEGY IN FAVOUR OF THE LEGITIMACY OF TORTURE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL ACTION. AFTER ANALYZING THE DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS WICH CLAIM FOR THE LAWFULNES OF TORTURE, THE AUTHOR ASSERTS THE EXISTENCE OF A CONCEPTUAL CONNECTION BETWEEN TORTURE AND ILLEGALITY, A PHENOMENOLOGICAL CONTRADICTION BETWEEN LAW AND TORTURE
201	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS, ON THE ONE HAND, TO EXPLAIN WHAT CLIENTELISM IS THROUGH A DESCRIPTION OF ITS CHARACTERISTICS IN ITS CURRENT ARGENTINEAN FORM. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WILL EVALUATE CLIENTELISM FROM A LEGAL AND POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE PURPOSES, WE WILL DISTINGUISH CLIENTELISM FROM LEGITIMATE POLITICS, AND THEN OFFER A CRITICAL EVALUATION IN CASE THERE WERE ANY DIFFERENCES. REGARDING THE FIRST OBJECTIVE, IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO RESORT TO SOME KIND OF CANONICAL DEFINITION, BROAD ENOUGH TO GRASP DIFFERENT CLIENTELISTIC PHENOMENA. THEN, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN ITS ARGENTINEAN PARTICULARITIES, NOTING THAT IT HAPPENS TO BE A SPECIALLY INTERESTING KIND OF CLIENTELISM BECAUSE OF ITS REFINEMENT AND BREADTH. AS TO THE SECOND OBJECTIVE, WE WILL OPPOSE TO THE REASONING THAT EQUATES CLIENTELISM AND LEGITIMATE TYPES OF POLITICAL ACTION. WE WILL ARGUE THAT ORDINARY POLITICS IS DIFFERENT AND THAT, IN FACT, THIS DIFFERENCE TURNS CLIENTELISM ILLEGITIMATE. CRITICISM AGAINST CLIENTELISM MAY INCLUDE EMPIRICAL APPROACHES BUT, AS THESE ONLY SHOW DEFICIENCIES OF A PARTICULAR PUBLIC POLICY, THEY LACK THE ABILITY TO BE EXTENDED TO OTHER CASES. ALTERNATIVE CRITICISM MAY BE MORE INTERESTING, BUT IT WILL NECESSARILY BE WEAKER AS IT MAY ONLY REVEAL A MODEL OF CITIZENS AND POLITICAL RELATIONS UPON WHICH CLIENTELISM IS GROUNDED.
202	THE IDEA OF ARTIFICIAL LEGAL INTELLIGENCE STEMS FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THEN CALLED JURIMETRICS. IT WAS BASED ON AN ALGORITHMIC UNDERSTANDING OF LAW, CELEBRATING LOGIC AS THE SOLE INGREDIENT FOR PROPER LEGAL ARGUMENTATION. HOWEVER, AS OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES HAS NOTED, THE LIFE OF THE LAW IS EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN MERELY LOGIC. MACHINE LEARNING, WHICH DETERMINES THE CURRENT WAVE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, IS BUILT ON DATA-DRIVEN MACHINE EXPERIENCE. THE RESULTING ARTIFICIAL LEGAL INTELLIGENCE MAY BE FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF PREDICTING THE CONTENT OF POSITIVE LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DISCUSS THE ASSUMPTIONS OF LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW AND CONFRONT THEM WITH THOSE OF COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS. AS A TWIN ARTICLE TO MY CHORLEY LECTURE ON LAW AS INFORMATION, THIS SHOULD INFORM THE EXTENT TO WHICH ARTIFICIAL LEGAL INTELLIGENCE PROVIDES FOR RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION IN LEGAL DECISION MAKING.
203	DO EASTERN EUROPEAN COURTS EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAIN POLITICIANS AND UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW? CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF GRAND (HIGH-LEVEL) CORRUPTION CAN FURTHER THE CENTRAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE LAW BY DEMONSTRATING THAT EVEN POWERFUL POLITICAL ACTORS HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE LAWS OF THE LAND. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE EASTERN EUROPEAN CORRUPTION PROSECUTION DATABASE, WHICH CONTAINS ENTRIES FOR ALL CABINET MINISTERS (927 IN TOTAL) WHO SERVED IN A GOVERNMENT THAT HELD OFFICE IN ONE OF SEVEN POST-COMMUNIST EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE THE LATE 1990S. THE SYSTEMATIC DATA COLLECTION REVEALS THAT BULGARIA, ROMANIA AND MACEDONIA CONSISTENTLY INDICT MORE MINISTERS THAN CROATIA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AND POLAND; SLOVAKIA HAS BARELY INDICTED ANYONE. WE AIM TO START A RESEARCH AGENDA BY FORMULATING HYPOTHESES ABOUT WHICH COUNTRIES WILL SEE MORE CORRUPTION PROSECUTIONS AND WHICH MINISTERS' CHARACTERISTICS WOULD MAKE THEM MORE LIKELY TO FACE THE COURT. WE USE THE DATABASE TO BEGIN TESTING THESE HYPOTHESES AND FIND SOME EVIDENCE FOR SEVERAL ASSOCIATIONS. WE FIND NO STRONG EVIDENCE THAT EU CONDITIONALITY OR MEMBERSHIP RAISES THE PROFILE OF THE GRAND CORRUPTION ISSUE OR LEADS TO MORE INDICTMENTS. PARTY POLITICS SEEMS TO AFFECT THE FREQUENCY OF CORRUPTION INDICTMENTS MORE THAN THE STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOR OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. INDICTMENT RATES ARE LOWER WHEN A FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY CONTROLS THE GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUAL MINISTERS FROM JUNIOR COALITION PARTNERS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO INDICTMENT THAN OTHER MINISTERS. THE EXISTENCE OF A SPECIALIZED ANTI-CORRUPTION PROSECUTION OR A MORE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY DO NOT SEEM TO LEAD TO THE INDICTMENT OF MORE MINISTERS ON CORRUPTION CHARGES. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS AVENUES OF FUTURE RESEARCH THAT OUR DATABASE OPENS, BOTH FOR THE ANALYSIS OF COUNTRY-LEVEL AND INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL VARIATION. (C) 2018 THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

204	IN RECENT DECADES, THE COURTS, PARTICULARLY ON A TRANSNATIONAL LEVEL, SEEM TO HAVE ADOPTED A LAW-MAKING FUNCTION THAT WAS TRADITIONALLY EXCLUSIVE TO PARLIAMENTS. THIS TREND IS OFTEN PROBLEMATISED AS A HOLLOWING-OUT OF DEMOCRACY. BY FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ACTION AND ON CLAIMANTS, INSTEAD OF ON ADJUDICATION, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT A DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT IS IN ORDER. IT DRAWS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A NORMATIVE CONNECTION BETWEEN LAW AND DEMOCRACY (AS MADE EXPLICIT BY JURGEN HABERMAS AND INGEBORG MAUS); AND YET IT ARGUES THAT PRECISELY BECAUSE LEGAL ACTION REMAINS LARGELY UNCONSIDERED, CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF DEMOCRACY FAIL TO EMBRACE AN IMPORTANT SHIFT FROM A LEGALISTIC VERSION TOWARDS A FULLY PROCEDURAL VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN DEFENDING THIS POSITION, HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY TO QUESTION THE TENDENCY OF THE GERMAN LEGAL TRADITION TO GIVE SUBSTANTIVE LAW PRIORITY OVER THE PROCEDURAL POSITION OF INDIVIDUALS. BY TURNING TO BERNHARD WINDSCHEID'S CONCEPT OF A CLAIM OR TITLE (ANSPRUCH), IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT THE POTENTIAL OF SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS REMAINS UNEXPLORED AS LONG AS ITS CORE ELEMENT - THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ACTION - IS UNDERESTIMATED. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT, IN FACT, TAKING LEGAL ACTION CAN AT TIMES UNFOLD ITS OWN "COUNTER-POLITICS," WHICH MATTERS FOR DEMOCRACY.
205	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS INTERPRETED THE RIGHT TO INTERPRETATION UNDER ARTICLE 6(3)(E) ECHR-A TOPIC WHICH, DESPITE ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE, HAS RECEIVED, TO DATE, VERY LIMITED SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. THE KEY FINDING IS THAT WE ARE WITNESSING A 'CAUTIOUS EVOLUTION': THE COURT HAS PROGRESSIVELY-YET SIMULTANEOUSLY CAUTIOUSLY-DEVELOPED THE STANDARDS AND GUARANTEES OF THIS RIGHT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RIGHTS OF DEFENCE UNDER ARTICLE 6(3) ECHR AND A REQUIREMENT OF THE FAIR TRIAL. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES, IN PARTICULAR, ON (I) HOW GENERAL INTERPRETATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE STRASBOURG COURT WERE APPLIED BY THE COURT IN ITS JURISPRUDENCE CONCERNING THE SAID PROVISION; (II) ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE OVERALL FAIRNESS OF THE TRIAL AND ARTICLE 6(3)(E) ECHR; AND (III) ON ARTICLE 6(3)(E) ECHR AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL ASSISTANCE/LEGAL AID AND THE RIGHT TO INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES POSSIBLE AREAS OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THIS RIGHT.
206	SINCE THE 1990S THE PROMOTION OF RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DEVELOPMENT. MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL DONORS HAVE ADOPTED IT AS A STAND-ALONE OBJECTIVE AND/OR INCLUDED IT AS A FEATURE OF THEIR GOOD GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HUMAN RIGHTS OR DEMOCRACY AGENDAS. WHILE THE DEFINITIONAL DEBATES ABOUT RULE OF LAW ABOUND,(1) TO SOME SCHOLARS THE 'DEGREE OF APPARENT INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS STRIKING'.(2) INDEED, THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS 'ANALOGOUS TO THE NOTION OF THE GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT EVERYONE IS FOR IT, BUT HAVE CONTRASTING CONVICTIONS ABOUT WHAT IT IS'.(3) ITS PERCEIVED IMPORTANCE IS CERTAINLY REFLECTED IN THE MILLIONS OF AID DOLLARS SPENT EVERY YEAR ON DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AIMED AT ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.(4)
207	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND GOVERNANCE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. IT SUBMITS A TWOFOLD MESSAGE ARGUING, ON THE ONE HAND, THAT THE CHANGE TO GOVERNANCE SO FORCEFULLY PROPAGATED BY THE PRODI COMMISSION IS A CONTINUATION OF MUCH OLDER EFFORTS TO COPE WITH THE INADEQUACIES INHERENT IN EUROPE'S INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN (IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE COMMUNITY METHOD) THROUGH ADAPTATIONS TO THE REGULATORY NEEDS OF THE INTEGRATION PROJECT. THE SECOND PART OF THE MESSAGE CONCERNS THOSE TENSIONS BETWEEN THESE INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS AND THE UNION'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW, OR WITH THE VERY IDEA OF LAW-MEDIATED, POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE RULE. IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THESE TENSIONS, THE CHANGE TO GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A COMPENSATORY SHIFT TO A CONFLICT OF LAWS APPROACH IN THE (RE) CONCEPTUALISATION OF EUROPEAN LAW IN GENERAL AND EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE IN PARTICULAR. ON THE BASIS OF SUCH A CONFLICT OF LAWS CONCEPTION OF EUROPEAN LAW, NOT ONLY CAN THE LATTER'S EFFECT ON NATIONAL LAW BE LEGITIMISED IN A WAY COMPATIBLE WITH DEMOCRACY, BUT ALSO THE NEW (AND NOT SO NEW) FORMS OF EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE CAN BE DEMARCATED AND CONSTITUTIONALISED ADEQUATELY.
208	CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED THAT COMMERCIAL COMMON LAW IS NOT DEVELOPING AS IT SHOULD DUE TO DISPUTES BEING RESOLVED BY CONFIDENTIAL INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION WHERE THE MAJORITY OF AWARDS ARE NOT PUBLISHED, AND THE RESULTANT LACK OF PRECEDENTS. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO QUESTIONS OF THE LEGITIMACY OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION AND WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS BEING UNDERMINED BY THE NON-PUBLICATION OF AWARDS OR BY THE DIVERSION OF DISPUTES TO ARBITRATION RATHER THAN LITIGATION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MEANING OF PRECEDENTS IN THIS CONTEXT AND THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER BEING LOST' TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION COMPARED TO THOSE MADE IN AUTHORITATIVE COMMON LAW SUPERIOR COURTS OF RECORD. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE NUMBER OF AWARDS OF PRECEDENTIAL VALUE (APV) IS SMALL COMPARED TO THE VOLUME OF COMMERCIAL JUDGMENTS OF THOSE COURTS, AND THAT THE PERCEIVED LOSS OF PRECEDENTS DOES NOT SUPPORT EITHER PUBLICATION OF AWARDS NOR DETERMINATION OF DISPUTES BY COURTS RATHER THAN BY TRIBUNALS. PRECEDENT MIGHT INSTEAD BE ENHANCED BY A WIDER RIGHT OF APPEAL FROM AWARDS AND BY PUBLICATION OF THE APPEAL DECISIONS.
209	THIS ESSAY DEALS WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE THEORIES OF THE CONCEPT OF MATERIAL CONSTITUTION. THESE THEORIES CHARACTERIZE FOR THEIR LOOKING FOR A BASEMENT OF LAW AT THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY, NOT REDUCED TO THE MERE BEING INTO FORCE OF THE STATUTES. IT HAS BEEN THIS WAY SINCE THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE OF THE 19TH CENTURY, BASED ON HISTORIC GROUNDS WHICH LINK TO SAVIGNY. THIS THEORY IS BASED UPON THE IDEA OF THE LEGAL ORDER OF THE NATION, WHICH LOGICAL EXPRESSION IS THE LAW OF THE STATE. THIS COHERENCE WOULD DISAPPEAR AT THE 20TH CENTURY, DUE TO THE CONTROVERSIAL USE OF THE NOTION OF MATERIAL CONSTITUTION AS OPPOSED TO THE LAW OF THE PARLIAMENT, UNDERSTOOD AS MERE FORMAL LEGISLATION. ONLY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE CENTURY IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND THE SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR A THEORY THAT TRIES TO TAKE UP AGAIN THE ORIGIN OF THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION IN THE DEEP ASPECT OF THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY. IN ITALY, COSTANTINO MORTATI IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE.
210	THIS REPORT SEEKS TO DISCUSS THE THREATS TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND EXPLORE HOW TO DEVISE A NEW PATH TOWARDS DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND THE CHALLENGES FACED: CIVIL WAR, SECTARIAN AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS, ETHNIC AND NATIONAL TENSIONS, INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND REGIONAL WARS, AND SOCIETAL VIOLENCE. THE IMPACT ON DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION, ESPECIALLY THE SENSE OF THREAT, WHETHER LITERAL OR THEORETICAL, LED TO THE TENDENCY OF DEMAGOGIC TOWARDS A POPULIST OUTLOOK IN PLURALISTIC SOCIETIES, GENERATING REACTIONS ACROSS OTHER SOCIETIES SUFFERING FROM EXTERNAL ALIENATION AND INTERNAL TYRANNY. THE WORLD IS CURRENTLY FACED WITH THE DECLINE OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL WHICH HAS LED US TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, PEACEFUL TRADING OF POWER, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND SOVEREIGNTY. THE POPULISTS ATTEMPT TO EXPLOIT THE IDEAS OF THE STEREOTYPICAL, ESPECIALLY ON HATRED OF THE OTHER, AND THE XENOPHOBIA AGAINST FOREIGNERS WHEN FACED WITH THE WAVE OF ASYLUM AND MIGRATION SEEKERS, DIMINISHING FREEDOMS AND CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS, COUPLED WITH THE REJECTION OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROTECTIONIST POLICY. VICTORIES SUCH AS BREXIT OR DONALD TRUMP'S IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD SCENES OF FEAR AND HATRED OF 'THE OTHER', ENCOURAGING INTOLERANCE AND EXTREMISM. THIS LED TO A RISE IN POLICIES AGAINST FOREIGNERS, MIGRATION, TERRORISM, ISLAM AND PROTECTIONIST ECONOMICS. THIS REPORT WILL LOOK AT A FUTURE BEYOND TRADITIONAL DEMOCRACY, DISCOVERING WHAT THE NEXT STAGE IN DEMOCRACY WILL BE, IN TERMS OF THE SURVIVAL OF SOCIETY, RAISING PROBLEMATIC QUESTIONS: IS DEMOCRACY, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR DYNAMICS, ABLE TO RESPOND TO THE CHANGING REALITIES, AND WHETHER IT CAN RENEW ITSELF AND OVERCOME SOME OF ITS ISSUES TO INVENT NEW METHODS AND LITERATURE?
211	DEVELOPING INTERNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, APART FROM DIFFICULTIES CONCERNING ITS DEFINITION, FACES CERTAIN WELL-KNOWN PROBLEMS - RANGING FROM ITS PLURALISTIC MODE OF CREATION TO ITS ENFORCEABILITY, BUT HAS ALSO TO SCRUTINISE ITS AIMS. IF ITS AIM IS TO AT LEAST PROVIDE A GLOBAL REFERENCE FRAMEWORK FOR CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS - SINCE SERVING AS A COMMON SET OF VALUES DOES REACH ITS OWN LIMITS RATHER QUICKLY EG CONCERNING FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN SOCIETY OR SUSTAINABILITY - IT HAS TO BE INCLUSIVE IN NATURE. CERTAIN AREAS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS - VIA UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW OR TREATY MONITORING BODIES SUCH AS CAT - OR WTO LAW INTERACT CLOSELY WITH NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND/OR REGIONAL INTERNATIONAL LAW (ECHR) AND OR REGIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL/PUBLIC LAW (EG EU LAW). THEREFORE, THEIR IDEAS MAY BE TAKEN UP - VOLUNTARILY THROUGH COURTS OR ACADEMIA, DUE TO EXAMINATION MECHANISMS THROUGH GOVERNMENTS OR TRIBUNALS - BE MODIFIED (IF NECESSARY TO FIT INTO A NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OR SUPRANATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK) AND TRANSPORTED BACK INTO THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY (EG AS FEEDBACK WITHIN A WTO CASE OR AN UPR). THIS, HOWEVER, IS EVENT DRIVEN. THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE A CAREFULLY CONCEPTUALISED COHERENT LAW SUCH AS NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS. NATIONAL (AND LAND CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH MAY ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT IDEALS) CONSTITUTIONS IN GENERAL SERVE SEVERAL FUNCTIONS: AS SET OF VALUES EG IN THE AREA OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, FOR STRUCTURING THE STATE FUNCTIONS BY SETTING UP INSTITUTIONS AND MODES OF OPERATION, AND AS REFERENCE FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF NORMS EG IN COURT CASES. THEIR OVERALL PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE A COHERENT INNER REGIME. NEVERTHELESS, BY PROMOTING CERTAIN SELECTED 'INSTITUTIONALISABLE' CONSTITUTIONAL IDEAS (FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW INITIATIVE) WE CAN AIM TO STRIVE FROM A FRAGMENTED TOWARDS A MORE COHERENT GLOBAL FRAMEWORK.
212	THE RISE OF SOMALI PIRACY IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY LED TO A SWIFT RESPONSE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED BY NAVAL FORCES IN THE HIGH SEAS EXERCISING UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION. AS THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR MARITIME PIRACY, THE SUSPECTS WERE PROSECUTED IN NATIONAL COURTS USING DOMESTIC LAWS. THE UNITED STATES PROSECUTED A HANDFUL OF CASES USING ITS PIRACY STATUTE PASSED IN 1909, WHICH INCORPORATES INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT PRESCRIBES MANDATORY LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR THOSE CONVICTED. ALTHOUGH THE DEFINITION OF THE CRIME OF PIRACY IN THE UNITED STATES EVOLVES ALONG WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE PUNISHMENT IS AN OUTLIER THAT DEVIATES FROM GLOBAL NORMS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PUNISHMENT FOR PIRACY IN THE UNITED STATES MUST ALSO EVOLVE WITH INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE BECAUSE A CHANGING DEFINITION OF A CRIME COUPLED WITH A FIXED PUNISHMENT MAY LEAD TO RULE OF LAW VIOLATIONS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE RESULTS.
213	THE CONCEPT OF WHOLE-PROCESS PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY CAN BE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF FOUR THE RULE OF LAW DIMENSIONS: CONTINUOUS DEMOCRACY, AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY, EXTENSIVE DEMOCRACY AND CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY. CONTINUOUS DEMOCRACY MEANS THAT DEMOCRACY PROVIDES A CONTINUOUS AND UNINTERRUPTED MECHANISM IN TERMS OF STAGE, TIME AND SPACE, WHICH CAN ENSURE THE CONTINUOUS PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS. AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY IS NOT ONLY EMBODIED CREATION OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CONDITIONS FOR THE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE CHANNELS AND METHODS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS, BUT IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE, INCLUDING THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THE MINORITY. EXTENSIVE DEMOCRACY MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE FULLY AND DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS AS WELL AS THEIR OWN AFFAIRS, FROM THE OPERATION OF THE STATE SYSTEM TO SOCIAL LIFE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, AND FROM PRE-ELECTION TO POST-ELECTION. CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY IS A MEANS OF REALIZING PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY IN THE WHOLE PROCESS. IT APPLIES CONSULTATION AND SEEKS TRUTH, AIMING AT BUILDING CONSENSUS. MOREOVER, IT INTEGRATES VARIOUS CHANNELS OF CONSULTATION, AND INTEGRATES DEMOCRACY INTO ALL ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) AND GOVERNMENT AND IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE PEOPLE'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE.
214	AS OF THE VALIDITY OF THE GENERAL CODE OF THE PROCESS, THERE HAS BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF A NORMATIVE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE DEVICE PRINCIPLE, AS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE CIVIL CASSATION RESOURCE, AND THE POWER GRANTED TO THE SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, TO JUDGE THE SENTENCES THAT, OSTENSIBLY, VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES. THIS WORK DESCRIBES THE HISTORICAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ORIGIN OF THE CIVIL APPEAL, AS A MODERN INSTITUTION, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE COLOMBIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. THE WORK ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM FROM A DOGMATIC PERSPECTIVE THAT INCLUDES THE HISTORICAL, DOCTRINAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE CIVIL CASSATION APPEAL, TO ESTABLISH THAT THIS LEGAL INSTITUTION IS OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGIN AND THAT, THEREFORE, ONE OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSES IS THE PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES.
215	THIS STUDY GOES BEYOND FIRM-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF MULTI-LAYER MONITORING MECHANISMS ON NARRATIVE DISCLOSURE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) REGIONS. BY USING A NEO-INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND ANALYZING DATA FROM 154 NON-FINANCIAL FIRMS BETWEEN 2015 AND 2018, THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT THE DEPTH OF NARRATIVES IN MENA COUNTRIES FALLS SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS AFTER THE GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE GUIDANCE. IN ADDITION, BOTH FIRM AND NATIONAL MONITORING MECHANISMS PUT ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON MANAGEMENT TO INCREASE THE CONTENT OF NARRATIVE REPORTS. THE FIRM MONITORING MECHANISMS PRESENTED IN BOARD INDEPENDENCE, GENDER DIVERSITY, AND INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP ENHANCE THE RICHNESS OF NARRATIVE SECTIONS. CONSIDERING THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATIONS QUALITY, THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE UNIQUENESS OF THE MENA NATIONAL MECHANISMS AFFECTS THE FIRM-LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH CAUSES REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AMONG MENA FIRMS. FURTHERMORE, THE QUALITY OF NATIONAL MONITORING MECHANISMS MODERATES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL OWNERSHIP ON THE DEPTH OF THE NARRATIVE INFORMATION, SINCE FIRMS OWNED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND OPERATING IN HIGHLY REGULATED COUNTRIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO DISPLAY DEEPER NARRATIVES. THIS STUDY PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF BOTH FIRM AND NATIONAL MONITORING MECHANISMS ON THE DEPTH OF NARRATIVES, DRAWING ON EVIDENCE FROM INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES WITH DIVERSE BOARDS IN TERMS OF INDEPENDENCE AND GENDER AND OPERATING IN HIGHLY REGULATED COUNTRIES. THIS WORK OFFERS UNIQUE INSIGHTS FROM THE NEO-INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, WHICH ASSERTS THAT FIRMS ADOPT SOCIAL NORMS AND RULES INTO THEIR OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURES TO GAIN SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE AND LEGITIMACY.
216	CONCEIVED AS A CONTRIBUTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE REFORM OF CONFINEMENT CONDITIONS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CASE OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION (UNTERSUCHUNGSHAFT) IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY FROM WORLD WAR 2 UNTIL TODAY, STARTING WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THIS REGIME HAS CONSTANTLY BEEN OPEN TO CRITICISM. THE EXCESSES OF AS WELL AS THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE REMAND SYSTEM HAVE INDEED CONTINUALLY BEEN CRITICISED SINCE AT LEAST THE ORDER REGULATING THIS PARTICULAR REGIME, WHOSE FIRST VERSION DATES BACK TO 1953. MOREOVER, THE CRITIQUE OF THIS NORMALIZED EXCEPTION MIGHT END UP CALLING INTO QUESTION THE STRENGTH OF THE ETAT DE DROIT AS A WHOLE. THEREFORE, MANY REFORM PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, WITHOUT CHANGING MUCH ON THE GROUND. WHY IS IT THAT A SYSTEM THAT IS UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED AS IRREGULAR AND EVEN OUTRAGEOUS PERSISTS AS IT DOES? IN ORDER TO HELP TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS ARTICLE FIRST PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL MOTIVES STRUCTURING THE CRITIQUE OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION: THAT IT IS A LEGAL LOOPHOLE; ITS DISPROPORTIONATE USE; ITS JUDICIAL UNFAIRNESS; THE PRISON SCANDALS; THE SOPHISTICAL CONTROL. IT THEN TRIES TO EXPLAIN THE NOTABLE DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF REMAND PRISONERS OVER TWO DECADES BY PLACING THIS QUANTITATIVE TREND IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A GLOBAL REDISTRIBUTION OF STATE COERCION.
217	THIS STUDY TRIES TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF LAW INSIDE A SOCIETY IN INDONESIAN CRIMINAL POLICY AND ITS THEORETICAL CONFLICTS. IN ADDITION, THIS STUDY TRIES TO DETERMINE THE SOCIETAL PERCEPTION OF THE NEW INDONESIAN CRIMINAL CODE AND ITS REPERCUSSIONS. THIS INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TRADITIONALLY. THIS STUDY WILL EXAMINE THE LAW IN ITS WRITTEN FORM AND AS CONCEPTS, IDEALS, VALUES, MORALITY, AND JUSTICE, ALSO KNOWN AS IDEOLOGICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND MORALISTIC LEGAL CONCEPTIONS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT IN INDONESIAN CRIMINAL POLICY, THE LAW IN SOCIETY HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED AS A SOURCE OF POSITIVE LAW. THE EXISTENCE OF A LAW THAT LIVES IN A SOCIETY IN INDONESIA'S CRIMINAL POLICY CAN BE SEEN, FOR INSTANCE, IN EMERGENCY LAW NO. 1 OF 1951 REGARDING "TEMPORARY MEASURES TO ORGANIZE UNITY OF THE STRUCTURE OF POWER AND PROCEDURES OF CIVIL COURTS," LAW NO. 14 OF 1970 REGARDING "THE BASIC PROVISIONS ON JUDICIAL POWER" WITH SEVERAL AMENDMENTS, AND EVEN IN THE CONSTITUTION, NAMELY ARTICLE 32 OF THE 1950 PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA. YET, THEORETICAL DEBATES REGARDING ITS EXISTENCE PERSIST. IN ADDITION, THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 2 (1) OF LAW NO. 1 OF 2023 ABOUT THE CRIMINAL CODE REDUCES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LAWS IN SOCIETY SO THAT THEY ARE ONLY UNDERSTOOD AS CUSTOMARY LAW. REDUCING THIS MEANING CAN LEAD TO INJUSTICE AND UNDERMINE OTHER SOCIAL STANDARDS IN CONTEMPORARY INDONESIAN SOCIETY. THESE MAY EVEN BE VIEWED AS CRIMINAL POLICIES THAT ARE DISCRIMINATORY AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC.
218	THIS PAPER WILL EXPLORE THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE KOREAN REFORMIST INTELLECTUALS' ADOPTION OF NEW PUBLIC VALUES AND NORMS IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY MOST STUDENTS OF KOREAN POLITICAL THOUGHT OF THE TIME ARGUE THAT THE REFORMISTS' RECEPTION OF THE NEW VALUES AND NORMS WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL FACTORS, THAT IS, THE COMING OF THE WEST AND THE SUBSEQUENT DESTABILIZATION OF THE TRADITIONAL EAST ASIAN INTERNATIONAL ORDER. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE FAILED TO FIND THE MECHANISM CONNECTING THE CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE REFORMISTS' ADOPTION OF NEW VALUES AND NORMS. THIS STUDY LOOKS FOR THE MECHANISM IN THE CHANGE IN THE REFORMISTS' WAY OF VIEWING THE WORLD. THE REFORMISTS SUPPORTED MODERN VALUES AND NORMS, LIKE MAN'S INNATE RIGHTS, INCREASED LIBERTY AND EQUALITY FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NORMATIVELY RIGHT OR SUPERB, BUT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD WESTERN WEALTH AND POWER AS THE RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THESE VALUES AND NORMS. THAT IS TO SAY, THEY ASSESSED THE WORLD ON THE BASIS OF EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS. THIS FACTUAL VIEW OF THE WORLD LED THEM TO CONSTRUCT NEW CONCEPTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND GOVERNMENT. THROUGH THE NEW IDEAS OF VALUES AND NORMS, HUMAN BEINGS, AND GOVERNMENT, THEY INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A NEW SOCIETY. THIS INDICATES THAT, AT LEAST IN THE VALUE SYSTEM OF THE REFORMISTS, THERE WAS A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THAT ERA. HOWEVER, THIS SHIFT WAS NOT ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF WESTERN INFLUENCES AT THE TIME BECAUSE SIRHAK SCHOLARS IN CHOSON'S CONFUCIAN TRADITION HAD ALREADY DEVELOPED THIS PERSPECTIVE OF THE WORLD IN THE 18TH CENTURY. IN THIS RESPECT, THERE IS CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE SIRHAK SCHOLARS AND THE REFORMISTS.
219	THERE IS A TENSION INHERENT WITHIN ANY LEGAL SYSTEM BETWEEN RESOLVING DISPUTES EFFICIENTLY AND ENSURING THAT JUSTICE IS ACHIEVED IN THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS GREATER TENSION, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE COMMON LAW DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT IN ORDER TO EVALUATE ITS WORTH AS A PUBLIC GOOD, AND THEN SEEKS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) SERVES TO DEVALUE OR DESTROY THIS PUBLIC GOOD. IT ARGUES THAT THERE IS A TRIPARTITE CORRELATION BETWEEN "HARD CASES", THE PUBLIC VALUE OF PRECEDENT ACHIEVED THROUGH ADJUDICATION, AND THE TENDENCY OF PARTIES TO DESIRE A THIRD-PARTY DETERMINATION. THUS, THOSE ADR PROCESSES THAT PROVIDE THIRD-PARTY DETERMINATION WILL ATTRACT HARD CASES, WITH A CORRESPONDING DECLINE IN BOTH ADJUDICATION AND THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT.
220	WHILE THE ABRUPT DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION INTO ITS COMPONENT REPUBLICS WAS SEEN BY MANY AS AN ERA DE NOVO, AND THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR OUTLAWING WARFARE AND WIDESPREAD CONFLICT, OTHERS WITHIN THE ANALYTIC COMMUNITY REGARDED THIS TURNING-POINT AS BOTH AN 'END' AND A 'BEGINNING'. THOUGH THE WORLD HAD SEEMINGLY MOVED BEYOND BIPOLARITY, EVENTS IN MANY GLOBAL CORRIDORS SERVED AS SHARP DEMYSTIFICATION OF CATACLYSMIC EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPOSITIONS OF A NEW AGE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY. THE COLD WAR WAS, HOWEVER, A DEVELOPMENT OF ENORMITY THAT WAS CONGRUOUS WITH RENEWED CONFLICT AND CONFRONTATION, YET IT ENABLED THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) TO ASSUME A GREATER ROLE WITHIN THE ORBIT OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, INCLUDING PEACE OPERATIONS AND MEDIATION. IN SPITE OF ITS NEW REACH AND FUNCTIONS, THE UN'S EARLY EXPERIENCE IN PEACE-BUILDING AS WELL AS SECURITY AND STABILIZATION OPERATIONS PROVED WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT FOR RESOLVING CONVENTIONAL CONFLICT BETWEEN PRECARIOUS NATION-STATES. IT SOME CASES, THE ROLE ASSUMED BY THE UN AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES PROVED INJURIOUS TO REGIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF THE ERITREAN-ETHIOPIAN WAR, THIS ARTICLE EXEMPLIFIES THE UN'S DEFICIENCY IN INTERNATIONAL MEDIATION AND THAT MANIFESTATIONS OF NATION-BUILDING DETRACTED FROM ITS RESPONSIVE CAPACITY TO EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION INTENDED TO INDUCE A SPEEDY AND SOLID PEACE-AGREEMENT. ERGO, WHILE THE UN WAS NOT PREPARED TO HANDLE A SITUATION WITH LARGE SET-PIECE BATTLES INVOLVING CONVENTIONAL ARMED FORCES, THE CONDUCT OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION PRECIPITATED A WAR THAT HAS LASTED WELL BEYOND ITS OWN NATURAL EXPIRATION, AND ONCE AGAIN PROVING THE UNSUITABILITY OF THE UN TO MANAGE INTERNATIONAL PEACE-BUILDING OPERATIONS AMID SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE.
221	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF SCIENTISTS CONCERNING THE RATIONAL STRUCTURING AND IMPROVING OF PRINCIPLES OF THE TAX SYSTEM. THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON THE AMBIGUITY OF THE VIEWS OF SCIENTISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE PLACE AND ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL TAX PRINCIPLES AS THE COMPONENTS OF THE TAX SYSTEM. THE ISSUE OF IMPROVEMENT OF THE TAX LAW SYSTEM AND ITS RATIONAL STRUCTURING OF PRINCIPLES IN UKRAINE CONTINUES TO BE RELEVANT. THE ROLE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF TAX LAW SINCE UKRAINE'S INDEPENDENCE AS PART OF THE UKRAINIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, HAS INCREASED IN MODERN LIFE IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE PERFORMANCE. THE AUTHORS OF THIS ARTICLE FOCUS ON THE AMBIGUITY OF THE VIEWS OF SCIENTISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE PLACE AND ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL TAX PRINCIPLES AS THE COMPONENTS OF THE TAX SYSTEM. THE BACKGROUND OF THIS RESEARCH CAUSED ON THE URGENT NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFICITIES OF SCIENTIFIC VIEWS OF SCIENTISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ON TAX PRINCIPLES. THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE IS TO IMPROVE THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF MODERN UKRAINIAN SYSTEM OF TAXATION PRINCIPLES AND REVIEW PRINCIPLES OF A. SMITH DEVOTED TO ISSUES OF INDIVIDUAL TAXING. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ON ISSUES OF STUDIES THE TAX PRINCIPLES ARE INDICATING THE DECLARATIVE CHARACTER OF ENSHRINED IN THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE PRINCIPLES OF TAX LAW. THE ESSENCE OF THESE 11 PRINCIPLES OF TAX LAW IS A DIRECT CONTINUATION OF TAX PRINCIPLES OF SCIENTISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF ENSHRINED IN THE GENERAL PART OF THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE PRINCIPLES OF TAX LAW IS PROBLEMATIC IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATIONS OF THE SPECIAL PART OF THIS TAX CODE.
222	IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT APPROVED TWO DECREE-LAW, LATER RATIFIED BY PARLIAMENT, CONFERRING THE PRIME MINISTER THE POWER TO ADOPT THE REGULATION TO IMPLEMENT THE SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES. THE ESSAY DEALS WITH THE COMPATIBILITY OF SUCH A NORMATIVE METHOD WITH THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION, IN PARTICULAR WITH THE PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE EXERCISE OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER BY THE GOVERNMENT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS (ART. 77) AND THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT ENSHRINED BY ART. 16 OF THE ITALIAN BASIC LAW.
223	THE ARTICLE DISC USSES THE PROJECTION OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU) POWER UNDER CONDITIONS OF CONTESTED STATEHOOD IN ITS 'NEAR ABROAD'. USING THE EU'S MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX) AS A CASE STUDY, THE ARTICLE UNPACKS THE VARIOUS LEVERS OF EXTERNAL EU INFLUENCE AND EXPLORES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH EUROPEAN POLICY-MAKERS BECOME ENTANGLED IN THE 'EXISTENTIAL DISCOURSE' OF HIGHLY POLARIZED SOCIETIES WITH COMPETING STATEHOOD CLAIMS. THE CONTESTATION OF THESE CLAIMS (BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY) PRODUCES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR EU ACTORNESS, AFFECTING BOTH SELF-ASCRIBED (INTERNAL TO THE EU) AND EXTERNAL (AMONGST THE EU'S INTERLOCUTORS) ASPECTS OF EU PRESENCE, WHICH, IN TURN, SHAPES THE EU'S ABILITY TO DEPLOY AND CO-ORDINATE ITS CAPABILITIES ON THE GROUND. IT IS BY REFERENCE TO THIS 'PRESENCE-CAPABILITIES' NEXUS THAT THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PLANNING AND EARLY DEPLOYMENT OF EULEX IN KOSOVO.
224	THE IMPACT OF THE COVID 19 LOCKDOWN OF WESTERN COUNTRIES HAS HAD EXTENSIVE COVERAGE, BUT FOR OTHER COUNTRIES, LIKE MYANMAR, LITTLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN SHARED IN THE WESTERN MEDIA. YET THE IMPACT ON EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES THERE HAS BEEN JUST AS GREAT, INCLUDING CLOSURE OF WORKPLACES AND UNIVERSITIES, THE WEARING OF MASKS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVELLERS FROM OUTSIDE MYANMAR. WHEN A PLANNED PROGRAMME OF FACE-TO-FACE LEGAL RESEARCH TEACHING IN MAY 2020 COULD NOT BE OFFERED, ANOTHER MEANS HAD TO BE FOUND TO DELIVER A COURSE WHICH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED THE PREVIOUS YEAR. IN THIS ARTICLE RUTH BIRD OUTLINES HOW THE COURSE WENT AHEAD EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS IN LOCKDOWN IN MELBOURNE, WHILE HER COLLEAGUES AND PARTICIPANTS WERE LOCKED DOWN IN YANGON.
225	THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND EXCEPTION, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CONTAINED WITHIN DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS, WERE SET TO OPERATE IN ALGERIA, MOROCCO AND TUNISIA AS A MECHANISM OF BASIC CONTROL AND MAINTENANCE OF LIBERAL AUTOCRACIES. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY MODEL WAS USED FOR THE SURVIVAL OF REGIMES IN TIMES OF INSTABILITY AND SOCIAL UNREST, LEADING IN SOME CASES TO THE SUSPENSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS FOR MANY YEARS. NEVERTHELESS, THESE PROVISIONS WERE MODIFIED OR LIFTED WHEN THE REGIME HAD TO SHOW A MORE CONVINCING STAKE TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN 2011.
226	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WAS A GENUINE STRESS TEST FOR SOCIETIES AROUND THE GLOBE. SOCIETAL VALUES WERE PUT UNDER PUBLIC SCRUTINY, WHIE FEAR REIGNED SUPREME ALLOWING LARGE MARGINS OF MANEUVER FOR GOVERNMENTS IN TAKING RESTRICTIVE MEASURES PROMISING AT LEAST TO WIN SOME TIME FOR HEATH SYSTEMS TO ADAPT TO THE NEW CHALIENGES. ALONG WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS GOVERNMENTS, JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AND SOCIETIES AT LARGE HAD TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY FUNCTION TO FACE THE PANDEMIC. IN THIS PAPER WE WILL PRESENT A CASE STUDY ON ROMANIA AND THE USAGE OF SANCTIONING MECHANISMS BY THE POLICE AND GENDARMERIE DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, MARCH 16-MAY 14, 2020. WE WILL EXPBRE THE CHALIENGES REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF A SOUND LEGAL BASIS FOR RESTRICTIVE MEASURES IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RESTRICTIONS WITH A FOCUS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF TWO ENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONS - THE ROMANIAN POLICE AND THE GENDARMERIE - IN THIS PROCESS. IN TIMES OF CRSIS, OR PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF CRISIS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ENJOYS EVEN MORE POWER THAN USUAL, THE GOVERNMENTAL ACTION MUST BE TRANSPARENT TO BUILD TRUST AND ENSURE THAT ABUSES DO NOT HAPPEN. MOREOVER, THE DATA GATHERED DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF COVID-19 COULD HELP SHAPE PUBLIC POLICIES FOR THE SUBSEQUENT WAVES WITH THE VIEW TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY WHITE POSSIBLY DECREASING THE RESTRICTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
227	IN JANUARY 2004 TOOK PLACE THE DEBATE CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE BAVARIAN CATHOLIC ACADEMY BETWEEN THEN CARDINAL RATZINGER AND THE INFLUENTIAL DEFENDER OF LAICISM, PHILOSOPHER JURGEN HABERMAS ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS IN OUR DAYS. THE DIALOGUE NEVERTHELESS WAS NOT AT ALL TENSE. SURPRISINGLY, FOR THE MOST PART, THE COINCIDENCES WERE MORE THAN THE DISCREPANCIES. IN THIS ESSAY, THE AUTHOR TRIES TO EVIDENCE THE CULMINATING GUIDELINES OF THAT EVENT.
228	THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY THAT APPEARS AFTER 1991, WHERE RESTRUCTURING THE STATE FROM THIS CONCEPT, AS WE MOVE FROM A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW TO A STATE OF LAW, WHICH IS DESIGNED AS A GENERAL CLAUSE, WHICH CROSSES TRANSVERSALLY THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS WHY ITS CONTENTS DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPERIOR TEXT, WHICH IS WHY THIS CLAUSE HAS MULTIPLE CONCRETIONS, BEING THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY, ONE OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT REALIZATIONS.
229	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE MOVEMENT TO ADOPT DEMOCRACY DURING THE ENLIGHTENMENT PERIOD, KOREA'S FIRST INTELLECTUAL ATTEMPT TO FUSE CONFUCIANISM AND DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER FIRST EXPLORES HOW ENLIGHTENMENT INTELLECTUALS ADOPTED THE DEMOCRATIC CONCEPT OF RULE BY THE PEOPLE (MINCHI) ON CONFUCIAN SOIL, WHERE EXPLICITLY DEFINED CONCEPTS AS RULE OF THE PEOPLE (MINBON) AND FOR THE PEOPLE (WIMIN) WERE NOT EXTANT. THEN THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THEY ADOPTED THE VALUE OF LIBERTY, A CONCEPT FOCUSING ON THE RIGHTS OF BOTH PARTIES ENGAGED IN A BILATERAL CONTRACT, BASED ON THE CONFUCIAN TRADITION THAT EMPHASIZED MORALITY IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ETHICAL ORDER CENTERING ON EXCHANGE OF DUTY FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT. THE FINDINGS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: FIRST, IN ADOPTING THE WESTERN PRINCIPLE OF RULE BY THE PEOPLE, KOREAN ENLIGHTENMENT INTELLECTUALS FOCUSED ON MAKING THE LATENT CONFUCIAN COUNTERPART PRINCIPLES MANIFEST. SECOND, THEY CLUNG TO CONFUCIAN TRADITION BY MATCHING THE WESTERN NOTIONS OF LIBERTY (RIGHT) AND RULE OF LAW WITH THE CONFUCIAN IDEAS OF MUTUAL BENEFIT AND RULE OF VIRTUE.
230	MARKET AND GOVERNMENT FAILURES LED TO THE FORMATION OF MULTI-STAKEHOLDER INITIATIVES (MSIS) AS AN ALTERNATIVE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE (EITI) IS ONE OF THESE. THE IMPACT ASSESSMENTS OF EITI YIELD MIXED RESULTS. THE VARIATION IN IMPACT MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFERENCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EITI STANDARD. THE AUTHORS IMPLEMENTED AN ORDERED LOGIT REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONTEXTUAL FACTORS AND COUNTRIES' LEVEL OF EITI COMPLIANCE. THE AUTHORS USED THE 2013-2015 WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGIS) TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF GOVERNANCE IN MEMBER COUNTRIES. THE EITI INTERNATIONAL SECRETARIAT'S QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF COUNTRIES' COMPLIANCE WITH THE EITI SAFEGUARD REQUIREMENTS WAS USED AS A PROXY FOR EITI COMPLIANCE. THE AUTHORS FOUND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEPTION OF POLITICAL FREEDOM AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFEGUARD REQUIREMENTS. THIS FINDING SUPPORTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC SPACE IN MAKING MSIS EFFECTIVE. THE AUTHORS ALSO FOUND THAT STATES THAT ARE PERCEIVED TO BE MORE CORRUPT, INEFFECTIVE AND HAS WEAK RULE OF LAW ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLY WITH THE EITI REQUIREMENTS. THE FINDINGS ON FREEDOM AND CORRUPTION ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS MODELS. COUNTRIES MAYBE COMPLYING WITH EITI TO IMPROVE THEIR REPUTATION AND BENEFIT FROM INCENTIVES A COMPLIANCE STATUS IN EITI BRING.

231	THIS ARTICLE DEEPENS AND EXEMPLIFIES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AESTHETICS, IDEOLOGY, AND POLITICS BY STUDYING A CASE OF AESTHETIC INTERVENTION IN PUBLIC SPACE: THE PARQUE BIBLIOTECA ESPANA PROJECT IN MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA. IN THIS WAY, FROM A QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH USING MIXED RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS, THIS WORK WILL LEAD US TO OBSERVE HOW THE AESTHETICS OF THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW WAS USED AS AN AESTHETIC/POLITICAL TOOL TO CONFRONT SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN MEDELLIN.
232	A CENTRAL MESSAGE DELIVERED BY THE HIGH COURT IN PLAINTIFF M61/2010E V COMMONWEALTH; PLAINTIFF M69 OF 2010 V COMMONWEALTH IS THAT AUSTRALIA'S CONSTITUTION AND COMMON LAW TRADITION DO PROVIDE SOME GUARANTEES AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE UNFAIRNESS AND THE ARBITRARY USE OF POWER, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A BILL OF RIGHTS. THE CASE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COURTS FACING DOWN ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT OF IMMIGRATION DECISION-MAKING. THIS TIME, THE FOCUS WAS ON THE SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING ASYLUM CLAIMS OUTSIDE OF AUSTRALIA'S "MIGRATION ZONE". IN A UNANIMOUS JUDGMENT, THE HIGH COURT RULED THAT TWO TAMIL ASYLUM SEEKERS DENIED REFUGEE PROTECTION ON CHRISTMAS ISLAND DID HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR DETERMINATIONS MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW. THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RULING FOR BOTH THE CURRENT REGIME AND PLANS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL PROCESSING CENTRE IN EAST TIMOR.
233	PRETEROSSI ADVANCES WHAT IN HIS OPINION ARE BOTH THE MAIN MERITS AND THE MAIN RISKS TOO OF THE THESIS ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAW AND POWER AS SUSTAINED BY FERRAJOLI IN PRINCIPIA IURIS. SPECIFICALLY, THE ATTEMPT TO DECONSTRUCT AND OVERCOME THE TRADITIONAL DICHOTOMY FORMAL RATIONALITY/SUBSTANTIVE RATIONALITY WITH A COMPLEX NOTION OF VALIDITY AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAW AND POWER IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST POWERFUL THOUGH SLIPPERY POINTS OF THE THEORY. IN PRETEROSSI'S OPINION, THE TENSION BETWEEN RATIONALITY AND WILL SHOULD ALWAYS AND UNAVOIDABLY BE PRESENT AT THE VERY CORE OF ANY SOCIETY, FAR MORE, AT THE VERY CORE OF LAW, WHATEVER ITS RELATIONS WITH POLITICS MIGHT BE (POLITICS IS INTERNAL TO LAW AND THE CONSTITUENT ACT IS BOTH FACTUAL AND NORMATIVE). CONSEQUENTLY, LEGAL THEORY MUST BE PREVENTED AGAINST FALLING INTO ANY SORT OF DISGUISING OR CONCEALING RECONSTRUCTION OF THAT UNAVOIDABLE TENSION.
234	MAJOR INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WORLD BANK, AFRICAN UNION, AND INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAVE MADE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBUST GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS A "SACRED UTTERANCE" SINCE THE 1990S. OUR STUDY AIMED TO REFUTE THIS COMMON THINKING BY EXAMINING HOW GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES HAVE AFFECTED THE EXPANSION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET IN 47 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FROM 2008 TO 2019. USING THE AVAILABILITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL AS A PROXY FOR FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT, OUR ARTICLE DEPARTED FROM EXISTING LITERATURE WHICH USED STOCK EXCHANGE CHARACTERISTICS AS BENCHMARKS FOR GROWTH IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET. THE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES COMPRISE THE SIX GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INDICES: CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE MODEL'S CONTROL VARIABLES INCLUDE GDP PER CAPITA, INFLATION, AND TRADE OPENNESS. OUR FINDING SUGGESTS THAT A GREAT QUALITY GOVERNANCE CLIMATE IS SIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING THE GROWTH OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET IN AFRICA USING THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH WITH CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS. CONSIDERING THESE FINDINGS, OUR RESEARCH MAKES THE CASE THAT SOLID INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS MIGHT ENCOURAGE THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL SYSTEMS GROWTH IN AFRICA. THEREFORE, THE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT RATE IN THE AFRICAN REGION WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE THROUGH STRENGTHENING LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS TO FACILITATE FINANCIAL INCLUSION.
235	THIS ARTICLE STARTS FROM THE OBSERVATION THAT IN CLASSICAL ATHENS THE DISCOVERY OF DEMOCRACY AS A NORMATIVE MODEL OF POLITICS HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING NOT ONLY A POLITICAL AND A LEGAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME A PHILOSOPHICAL ENTERPRISE. REFLECTIONS ON THE CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL LAW AND ON THE MEANING OF PUNISHMENT CAN GREATLY BENEFIT FROM REFLECTIONS ON ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY AS A GERM FOR OUR CONTEMPORARY DEBATE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN A DEMOCRACY. THREE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ATHENIAN MODEL WILL BE ANALYSED: THE SELF-INSTITUTING CAPACITY OF A DEMOCRACY BASED ON PARTICIPATORY AND REFLECTIVE CITIZENSHIP, POLITICAL POWER AS THE CAPACITY OF CITIZENS FOR CO-OPERATING AND CO-ACTING WITH OTHERS, AND THE CRIME OF HUBRIS AS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IN ATHENIAN CRIMINAL LAW. THESE ANALYSES WILL LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES OF A DEMOCRATIC LEGAL ORDER LIES IN ITS CAPACITY OF RECOGNIZING THE FRAGILITY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AND OF DEVELOPING WORKABLE AND EFFECTIVE STANDARDS OF JUSTICE IN THAT CONTEXT. A RELATIONAL CONCEPTION OF CRIMINAL LAW AND PUNISHMENT, BASED ON PROPORTIONALITY, REFLEXIVITY, MUTUAL RESPECT AND RESPONSIBILITY FITS BEST WITH A DEMOCRACY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
236	OUR STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON HEALTH SYSTEM OUTCOMES, UTILIZING WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND ANALYZING DATA FROM 158 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2001 AND 2020. WE EMPLOYED PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO CREATE A COMPOSITE INDEX OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND CONDUCTED VARIOUS TESTS TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMETRIC MODEL. THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER VARIABLES, IN HEALTH OUTCOMES WAS ESTIMATED USING FIXED EFFECTS AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) MODELS. HIGH-INCOME AND LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES WERE ANALYZED SEPARATELY. THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REVEALED THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AS MEASURED BY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INFANT MORTALITY RATES AND A POSITIVE IMPACT ON LIFE EXPECTANCY. SIMILARLY, VARIABLES SUCH AS GDP, MEAN YEARS OF SCHOOLING, TOTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE, AND URBANIZATION RATE SHOWED A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH INFANT MORTALITY RATES AND A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH LIFE EXPECTANCY. CONVERSELY, THE LOGARITHM OF CO2 EMISSIONS EXHIBITED A POSITIVE EFFECT ON INFANT MORTALITY RATES AND A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON LIFE EXPECTANCY. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN DETERMINING HEALTH OUTCOMES. IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC AND MERITOCRATIC SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENT, EFFICIENT TAX AND SUBSIDY SYSTEMS, OPTIMAL BUDGET ALLOCATION, IMPROVED PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND ENHANCED ACCESS TO PRIMARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THE INFLUENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES COMPARED TO LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. IN CONCLUSION, OUR STUDY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN SHAPING HEALTH SYSTEM OUTCOMES. ENHANCING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE OVERALL ADVANCEMENT OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, ENCOMPASSING GOVERNANCE, INFRASTRUCTURE, EDUCATION, AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. IT IS CRUCIAL TO PRIORITIZE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES, TO ACHIEVE BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE.
237	ON 12TH MARCH 2018, THE IRISH HIGH COURT REFUSED TO EXECUTE THREE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANTS ISSUED BY POLISH AUTHORITIES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE POLISH JUSTICE SYSTEM. INSTEAD, THE IRISH COURT REFERRED TWO QUESTIONS FOR A PRELIMINARY RULING IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE TEST DEVELOPED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IN ARANYOSI E CALDARARU WITH REGARD TO THE POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION OF INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT MAY APPLY IN THE EVENT OF A POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. THE AUTHOR TACKLES THIS TOPIC AND TRIES TO ASSESS WHETHER THE POLISH ISSUING AUTHORITIES MAY STILL BE REGARDED AS JUDICIAL IN NATURE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS POLAND IS FACING.
238	BROUSSEAU, ERIC, SCHEMEIL, YVES, AND SGARD, JEROME - BARGAINING ON LAW AND BUREAUCRACIES: A CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT IS LINKED TO THE RISE OF AN INTEGRATED AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMY AND POLITY THAT ALLOW A MAXIMAL DIVISION OF LABOR AND INNOVATION. THIS PROCESS RELIES ON TWO INTERTWINED DYNAMICS. FIRST, IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATED BY THOSE WHO CALL FOR MORE AUTONOMY, RESULTING IN A PROGRESSIVE EQUALIZATION OF RIGHTS. SECOND, DEVELOPMENT OF A CAPABLE AND IMPARTIAL STATE IS A PREREQUISITE TO IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS, INCLUDING THEIR TRANSLATION INTO SERVICES DELIVERED TO CITIZENS. THE MUTUAL EXPANSION OF THESE DYNAMICS RELIES ON A VERTICAL NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE ELITE AND THE GOVERNED. THE GOVERNED CALL FOR RIGHTS THAT ARE MORE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AND MORE EXTENDED. THE RULING ELITE CAN GRANT THESE RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN ITS LEGITIMACY AND HENCE ITS RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY. THIS MODEL ALLOWS DISCUSSING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF VARIOUS PATHS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN PROCESSES OF DEVELOPMENT BY IDENTIFYING THE POTENTIAL VIRTUOUS DYNAMICS AND HINDERING FACTORS.

239	THE CONFIGURATION OF THE JUDICIAL POWER DESIGNED BY THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1978 IS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF A UNIQUE BODY OF JUDGES AND MAGISTRATES WHO IS IN CHARGE ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS OF EXERCISING THE JURISDICTIONAL FUNCTION. WE HAVE TO ADD TO THESE CHARACTERISTICS THE IRREMOVABILITY, RESPONSIBILITY AND EXCLUSIVE SUBMISSION TO THE EMPIRE OF THE LAW OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED PUBLIC SERVANTS, THEREBY ENSURING THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXISTENCE OF A STATE GOVERNED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO REFLECT AND TO ANALYZE THE EXCEPTIONS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF JURISDICTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT CONTROVERSIAL SUPPOSITIONS THAT SEEM TO QUESTION THE RESERVATION OF JURISDICTION OF THE JUDGES AND THE SPANISH COURTS.
240	THE FIGHT AGAINST THE PANDEMIC, WHICH THUS FAR HAS PROVED A SUCCESS IN GERMANY, HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED RESTRICTION ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. NEVERTHELESS, THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION, RESPECTING THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY AND THE ESSENCE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE SUSPENSION OF THOSE RIGHTS IS NOT RECOGNISED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THE BASIC LAW. HEALTH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WAS ESSENTIALLY BASED ON THE ORDINARY FEDERAL LAW CONCERNING PROTECTION AGAINST INFECTIONS. THE REGULATIONS OF THE FEDERATION MEMBER STATES, WHICH ESTABLISHED THE ESSENTIAL MEASURES, WERE BASED ON THAT. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ALL RESTRICTIONS WAS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY LEGAL IMPEDIMENTS. UNTIL NOW, CASE LAW HAS ONLY MADE CORRECTIONS IN A FEW CASES. THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE REMAINED UNTOUCHED. GERMANY'S FEDERAL STRUCTURE HAS MADE IT NECESSARY TO COORDINATE THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE MEMB(E)R STATE GOVERNMENTS. THIS HAS LED TO A PLURALITY OF MEASURES WHICH HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN JUSTIFIED (B)Y THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY.
241	THE RECENT CASE LAW OF THE CJEU ON ARTICLE 19 TEU HAS CONFIRMED TIME AND AGAIN THE EXTREMELY BROAD MATERIAL SCOPE OF THIS PROVISION. AT THE SAME TIME, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE VERY BROAD PREROGATIVES OF NATIONAL JUDGES TO REFER PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS TO THE COURT, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT, AT LEAST POTENTIALLY, ALMOST ALL ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS HAVING A CONNECTION WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE CAN END UP IN A WAY OR ANOTHER BEFORE THE LUXEMBOURG COURT. AFTER SOME INITIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT FORECASTED THAT ADMISSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN PRELIMINARY RULING CASES COULD PLAY A TRUE LIMITATIVE ROLE, MORE RECENT RULINGS MAKE APPARENT THAT THE COURT HAS TURNED BACK TO A RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE AND OPEN POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE `RELEVANCE CRITERION'. THE SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND POTENTIAL IMPACT IN NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF ARTICLE 19 TUE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW EMERGES THEREFORE AS THE CRUCIAL QUESTION TO BE SOLVED BY THE CJEU.
242	CAN A FEW PRIMARILY WESTERN STATES EXPAND THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS, INCORPORATING THE UNWILLING OR UNABLE STANDARD? EVEN ON A TRADITIONAL READING OF CUSTOMARY LAW FORMATION, THE ANSWER IS NO BECAUSE PROPONENTS HAVE FAILED TO ATTRACT CONSISTENT AND WIDESPREAD SUPPORT. WHAT IS MORE, USING OUR INTERACTIONAL INTERNATIONAL LAW APPROACH, WE SHOW THAT EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF LAW CONCERNS. THE CURRENT STATE OF WORLD POLITICS HAS PERHAPS CAUGHT PROPONENTS OF THE UNWILLING OR UNABLE STANDARD IN A DIFFICULT BIND. WE SUGGEST HOW PROPONENTS MIGHT CAREFULLY DEVELOP THE LAW ON SELF-DEFENCE AGAINST NON-STATE ACTORS.
243	SUSTAINABLE LOCAL SETTLEMENT IN THE AREA OF REFUGE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE DURABLE SOLUTIONS TO DISPLACEMENT, BUT NOT SO MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS (IDPS) SELF-SETTLE IN URBAN SETTINGS. BASED ON TWO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS CARRIED OUT AMONGST IDPS IN AN URBAN SETTING IN THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED EAST OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC), THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE MAIN STAGES OF SETTLEMENT OF IDPS, RANGING FROM BEING HOSTED TO BECOMING A FORMAL OWNER OF A PLOT. COMBINING THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES FROM REFUGEE STUDIES AND LAND STUDIES, THE PAPER INVESTIGATES TO WHAT EXTENT THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF SETTLEMENT BRING TENURE SECURITY TO IDPS. POLICY OFTEN ASSUMES THAT FORMAL OWNERSHIP IS DESIRABLE AS IT PROVIDES TENURE SECURITY AND SUBSEQUENTLY ECONOMIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR DATA SHOW THAT EVEN FORMAL OWNERSHIP DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE TENURE SECURITY WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS LACKING AND THAT OBTAINING 'ACCESS' TO A PROPERTY IS MORE CRITICAL THAN OBTAINING RIGHTS. YET, IDPS NEVERTHELESS CONTINUE TO ASPIRE OWNERSHIP THAT IS AS FORMAL AS POSSIBLE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS RELATED TO THE SOCIAL STATUS OF OWNERSHIP THAT HELPS TO TRANSFORM SOMEBODY FROM AN OUTSIDER THAT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE CITY TO A RESIDENT THAT IS ENTITLED TO CLAIM HER/HIS RIGHT TO THE CITY AND BENEFIT FROM THE ADVANTAGES THAT COME WITH BELONGING TO URBAN SPACE. THERE IS THUS A STRONG MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL STATUS AND CONNECTIONS ON THE ONE HAND AND TENURE SECURITY AND ACCESS TO HOUSING ON THE OTHER HAND THAT FEED INTO PEOPLE'S SENSE OF BELONGING.
244	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RESURGENCE OF A CERTAIN QUASI-RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OF NUCLEAR THREAT WITHIN THE POST-9/11 POLICYMAKING OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION; A DISCOURSE WHICH HAS INFLECTED AMERICAN NUCLEAR POLICYMAKING THROUGHOUT THE PAST SIXTY YEARS, BUT WHICH HAS PROVEN PROFOUNDLY DISSONANT WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL LANDSCAPE OF THE EARLY TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. DRAWING UPON CARL SCHMITT'S CONCEPT OF "POLITICAL THEOLOGY," I ELUCIDATE THE MANNER IN WHICH NUCLEAR WEAPONS TECHNOLOGY HAS SERVED SINCE 1945 TO UNDERGIRD A POWERFUL PRAXIS OF AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY-A SOVEREIGNTY THREATENED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE DISSEMINATION OF NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND BY THE EVER-BURGEONING REGULATORY MECHANISMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. ULTIMATELY, I ASSERT THAT THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL THEOLOGY NOT ONLY PROVIDES US WITH AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF DECIPHERING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S ESCHATOLOGICAL POLICYMAKING LANGUAGE, BUT THAT IT CLARIFIES WHAT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DISCOURSE OF NUCLEAR THREAT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION'S ENDEAVOR TO BOLSTER THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE US-PARTICULARLY OF ITS EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
245	IN THE YEARS SINCE 9/11, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY DISCOURSE HAS HEIGHTENED CONCERNS AROUND EXTREMISM, POSITIONING THIS AS THE KEY THREAT THAT STATES NEED TO ADDRESS IN ORDER TO PREVENT AND COMBAT TERRORISM. POLITICALLY, ENACTMENT OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION CURTAILING EXTREMIST EXPRESSIONS HAS BEEN INTERNATIONALLY AUTHORISED AND ENCOURAGED AND IN MAY 2016 THE UNITED KINGDOM ('UK'), SPEARHEADING A LIBERAL STATE TREND TOWARDS RIGHTS-RESTRICTIVE APPROACHES TO EXTREMISM, ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO ENACT LEGISLATION IMPOSING A RANGE OF CIVIL SANCTIONS ON THOSE PUBLICLY EXPRESSING EXTREMIST VIEWS. BUT LAWS SUCH AS THIS RESTRICT THE CORE DEMOCRATIC RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND SO MUST COMPLY WITH THE TRIPARTITE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESTRICTIONS ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 19(3) OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS ('ICCPR') TO BE LEGITIMATE. USING THE UK TO DYNAMICALLY EXEMPLIFY THE ISSUES, THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE MANNER IN WHICH THE LAWS CURTAILING EXTREMIST EXPRESSIONS COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW.
246	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO SILENCE AND TO PRIVACY AND THE IMPORTANT GOAL OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUTH. IT TRACES EXCLUSIONARY RULES FROM THE INQUISITORIAL RULES RELATING TO NULLITIES, TO MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY AND JURISPRUDENTIAL RULES FOR EXCLUDING ILLEGALLY GATHERED EVIDENCE.
247	WE DEFEND IN THE PAPER THAT THE LOGICAL-TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONALISM AND THE DEPERSONALIZATION OF POLITICAL SUBJECTS, ASSUMED FOR POLITICAL LIBERALISM AS BASIS OF JUSTIFICATION OF THE CONTEMPORARY PLURALIST DEMOCRACY, DO NOT ALLOW THE FACING OF THE GROWING FASCISM BY THE FACT THAT THEY MINIMIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND DEPOLITICIZE THE SOCIAL SUBJECTS, INDIVIDUALIZING AND PERIPHERIZING THEM. SO, IN POLITICAL LIBERALISM, SUBJECTS WITH NO CLASS BELONGING AND NO CLASS LINKING LOSS THEIR POLITICAL PROTAGONISM, WHICH BECOMES CENTRALIZED AND STREAMLINED BY BASIC STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY OR BY SOCIAL SYSTEMS AS STRUCTURES WITH NO SUBJECT, NON-POLITICAL AND NON-NORMATIVE ONES, BASICALLY WITH AN INSTRUMENTAL CHARACTER. WE ARGUE THAT THIS LIBERAL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE NEEDS TO BE COMPLEMENTED WITH TWO FUNDAMENTAL POINTS OF MARXISM, NAMELY, THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL-ECONOMIC CLASS AS A MACRO-STRUCTURAL SUBJECT THAT, IN ITS CONFLICTS, COUNTERPOINTS, CONSENSUS AND HEGEMONIES, STREAMLINES WIDE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES, AND THE QUESTION OF THE CRITIC OF IDEOLOGY, THAT IS, THE PERFORMING OF A PERSPECTIVE OF POLITICAL ACTIVISM AND SOCIAL CRITICISM BASED ON THE CLASS PLACE AND THE CLASS EXPERIENCES, OF A SOCIAL SUBJECT THAT ORGANIZES ITSELF, COMPREHENDS ITSELF AND ACTS AS SOCIAL-ECONOMIC CLASS.
248	IN THIS ARTICLE, I SHOW THAT THE GREAT HUMAN RIGHTS DEBATES OF GERMANY'S EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, WHICH FOCUSED ON TORTURE IN THE EIGHTEENTH AND THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE NINETEENTH, WERE WAGED NOT PREDOMINANTLY IN THE COURTS OF LAW, BUT FAR MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IN THAT OF PUBLIC OPINION. CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE ABOUT EACH CENTURY'S MOST FAMOUS HUSBAND-KILLER, MARIA KATHARINA WACHTLER (1750-88) AND CHRISTIANE 'NANETTE' RUTHARDT (1804?-45), SHOWS THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS - UNDERSTOOD HERE AS THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND THE RIGHT NOT TO BE TORTURED - OWED MORE TO LITERARY PORTRAYALS IN THE PRESS THAN TO LEGAL ARGUMENT. ALONG THE WAY, I CONTEST SOME COMMON ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING SVEN KRAMER'S ASSERTION THAT THE EDUCATED ELITE PREDOMINANTLY OPPOSED TORTURE DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, AND RICHARD EVANS'S CLAIM THAT EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY PAMPHLETS INEVITABLY TOOK THEIR CUE FROM THE AUTHORITIES IN THEIR PORTRAYAL OF CRIMINALS AND CRIMES.
249	THE PROCESS OF STATEBUILDING IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE 2001 HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY A DIVERSE SET OF PROBLEMS, INCLUDING THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF EARLY POLITICAL DECISIONS, THE CHOICE OF INSTITUTIONAL FORMS THAT HAVE FOSTERED DYSFUNCTIONAL POLICY-MAKING, AND THE SLIDE TOWARDS A NEOPATRIMONIAL SYSTEM COMBINING BUREAUCRACY WITH PATRONAGE. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE HAD A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON THE STATEBUILDING ENTERPRISE, LEAVING AN AMBIGUOUS LEGACY AS AFGHANISTAN PROCEEDS TOWARDS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PHASES OF ITS MODERN HISTORY.
250	THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY, THOUGH SO FAR IN BETTER SHAPE THAN EUROPE, IS FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF VERY SLOW GROWTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ITS TENDENCY TO VOLATILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED IN 2008-09, WHEN RUSSIAN GDP FELL MORE THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER LARGE COUNTRY. LOOKING AT THAT EXPERIENCE AND AT CURRENT CONCERNS, IT SEEMS THAT RUSSIA HAS BOTH DEMAND-SIDE (SLOW WORLD GROWTH, UNCERTAIN FUTURE OIL PRICES) AND SUPPLY-SIDE (FALLING LABOUR FORCE) PROBLEMS. THE CONTINUING FAILURE TO PROVIDE SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR BUSINESS PROBABLY COMPOUNDS THESE DIFFICULTIES.
251	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES REFLECTIONS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. AFTER A BRIEF HISTORIC, IT IS ANALYZED THE APPEARANCE AND AWARENESS OF THESE RIGHTS NOW DAYS, EVEN THOUGH THEY CONTINUE TO BE NEGLECTED AND AFFRONTED. REMEMBERING THAT HUMANITY HAS WATCHED A LONG DUTY ENFORCEMENT ONLY GIVING SPACE TO THE RIGHTS IN THE LAST TWO CENTURIES. THE DISREGARD OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS IN CAPITALISTIC AND COMMUNIST REGIMES IS STUDIED, AS WELL AS THE INSERTION OF THESE RIGHTS IN TO THE DIFFERENT LEGISLATION OF THE STATES.
252	THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT WAS INTENDED TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATION AND HARM FROM OTHER PEOPLE. RACISM IS NOT THE ONLY THING PEOPLE NEED PROTECTION FROM. AS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT IS NOT CONFINED TO ITS HISTORICAL ORIGIN AND PURPOSE, BUT IS AVAILABLE NOW TO PROTECT ALL HUMAN BEINGS, INCLUDING ALL UNBORN HUMAN BEINGS. THE SUPREME COURT CAN DEFINE "PERSON" TO INCLUDE ALL HUMAN BEINGS, BORN AND UNBORN. IT SIMPLY CHOOSES NOT TO DO SO. SCIENCE, HISTORY AND TRADITION ESTABLISH THAT UNBORN HUMANS ARE, FROM THE TIME OF CONCEPTION, BOTH PERSONS AND HUMAN BEINGS, THUS STRONGLY SUPPORTING AN INTERPRETATION THAT THE UNBORN MEET THE DEFINITION OF "PERSON" UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. THE LEGAL TEST USED TO
253	WITH THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF MY COUNTRY'S MARINE ECONOMY, HUMAN SOCIETY IS DEMANDING MORE AND MORE MARINE RESOURCES AND SPACE, RESULTING IN SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE MARINE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MARINE ECOLOGY AND IMPROVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE RESOURCES, THIS PAPER STUDIES THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF MARINE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BASED ON THE BACKGROUND OF WIRELESS NETWORK INFORMATION FUSION. BY STUDYING THE STATUS QUO OF SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MARINE PORTS AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA, BUILDING A WIRELESS NETWORK INFORMATION FUSION PLATFORM, INTEGRATING WIRELESS NETWORK INFORMATION INTO MARINE ECOLOGICAL SURVEYS, COLLECTING DATA THROUGH WSN NODES, AND COMPARING WIRELESS NETWORK INFORMATION FUSION WITH TRADITIONAL METHODS, THE EFFICIENCY OF MARINE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF MARINE POLLUTION METHODS IN DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME COORDINATE THE RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND BUILD A SUSTAINABLE MARINE ECOLOGY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE MONITORING EFFICIENCY BASED ON WIRELESS NETWORK INFORMATION FUSION IS MORE THAN 25% HIGHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL MONITORING METHOD, AND THE RECOGNITION EFFICIENCY AFTER 3 MONTHS IS STILL MORE THAN 20% HIGHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL METHOD. THIS SHOWS THAT INFORMATION FUSION IN WIRELESS NETWORKS CAN PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LEGAL SYSTEM FOR MARINE ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.
254	LAW PROFESSORS AND POLITICAL SCIENTISTS GENERALLY SUBSCRIBE TO OPPOSED THEORIES OF SUPREME COURT DECISION MAKING. LAW PROFESSORS, TO A GREAT DEGREE, ADHERE TO AN INTERNAL VIEW: SUPREME COURT JUSTICES DECIDE CASES ACCORDING TO LEGAL RULES, PRINCIPLES, AND PRECEDENTS. POLITICAL SCIENTISTS FOLLOW AN EXTERNAL VIEW: JUSTICES DECIDE CASES ACCORDING TO THEIR POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES OR PREFERENCES. THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS AN INTERPRETIVE-STRUCTURAL THEORY THAT HARMONIZES THESE SEEMINGLY OPPOSED VIEWS. THIS INTERPRETIVE-STRUCTURAL THEORY NOT ONLY EXPLAINS WHY THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VIEWS OFTEN ARE BOTH EFFECTIVE BUT ALSO WHY, SOMETIMES, ONE APPROACH MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE OTHER. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY COMPARING THE INTERPRETIVE-STRUCTURAL THEORY WITH THE "NEW INSTITUTIONALISM" THAT IS EMERGING IN POLITICAL SCIENCE.
255	MANY SCHOLARS AND ANALYSTS STATED THAT MULTICULTURALISM FAILED AND BLAMED IT FOR FOSTERING RADICALIZATION IN PLURALIST SOCIETIES. SUCH ANALYSES SEEM HOWEVER TO BE SIMPLISTIC. OTHER DYNAMICS, SUCH AS SOCIAL ACCELERATION AND THE EROSION OF SOCIAL SECURITIES ARE IN FACT AT WORK. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MEANING OF RADICALIZATION AND THE PROCESS OF THE "IDEOLOGIZATION OF CULTURES", HIGHLIGHTING THAT AN "IDENTITY TRAP" CAN BE FOUND IN BOTH SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS OF MULTICULTURALISM AND EVEN INTERCULTURALISM AND IN NEW NATIONALIST IDEOLOGIES. IT THEN DISCUSSES THE IDEA OF LOCALIZING AND PROCEDURALIZING CONFLICTS, MATCHING SUCH A LEGAL APPROACH TO PLURALISM WITH A NECESSARY POLITICAL ONE. THE VALUE OF PLURALISM CAN IN FACT ONLY BE AFFIRMED BY MEDIATING AND 'TAKING SERIOUSLY' THE DEMANDS OF SOCIAL ACTORS. TO ARTICULATE SUCH CLAIMS IN TERMS OF "POLITICS OF DIFFERENCE" IS A LOSING MOVE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS APPROACH HAS SUCCEEDED IN REVEALING THE LIMITS OF MODERN UNIVERSALISM. ON THE THEORETICAL LEVEL, OUR EFFORTS SHOULD BUILD ON THE LONGSTANDING WORK CARRIED OUT BY CRITICAL THEORIES IN GENERAL AND FEMINIST THEORY IN PARTICULAR TO SEEK TO RENDER UNIVERSALISM MORE INCLUSIVE. INDEED, SUCH A CONCEPTION OF UNIVERSALISM, WHICH TAKES SHAPE AND CONTENT FROM THE MULTIPLICITY OF STRUGGLES AND IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTANTLY FORMING CAN INSPIRE NOT ONLY THE STRUGGLE FOR RIGHTS BUT ALSO POLITICAL ACTION WHICH, INSTEAD OF BREAKING APART INTO MULTIPLE IDENTITY-BASED DEMANDS, IDENTIFIES THE COMMON OBJECTIVES TO BE PURSUED.
256	MANY WORKS ARE WRITTEN ON THE VALUE OF JUSTICE. JUSTICE REPRESENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY A UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE AND AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF LEGAL REGULATION. "JUSTICE" SEARCHES HAVE GENERATED THE LAW AS A CULTURAL AND SOCIAL PHENOMENON. AS A CLASSICAL AUTHOR HAS FAIRLY NOTICED, "NOTHING REVOLTS US MORE THAN INJUSTICE: ALL OTHER EVIL WE SHOULD BEAR IS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH IT". UNDOUBTEDLY, IN THE FIRST PLACE, JUSTICE REQUIREMENT CONCERNS THE CRIMINAL LAW SPHERES. PUBLIC RELATIONS IN THIS SPHERE OF LEGAL REGULATION MAKE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT, BOTH ON HUMAN LIFE AND ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIETY.
257	THE CURRENT GEOLOGICAL TRANSITION IMPLIES THE NECESSITY OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN DOMINANT SOCIAL PRACTICES TO COPE WITH AN EMERGING UNSTABLE GLOBAL SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL COMPLEX, WHICH IS BEING SHAPED BY COMPREHENSIVE, IRREVERSIBLE AND UNCERTAIN HUMAN AGENCY. ALONG WITH SUSTAINABILITY, ISSUES OF JUSTICE ARE CRUCIAL IN THIS CONTEXT INCLUDING CLIMATE JUSTICE, WHICH ADDRESSES THE MOST NOTORIOUS PHENOMENON OF THE TRANSITION TO THE ANTHROPOCENE, I.E. CLIMATE CHANGE. SUCH A PARADIGM SHIFT IMPLIES THE NEED TO GO BEYOND ESTABLISHED PRACTICES IN RESEARCH AND EXPLORING NEW NARRATIVES. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A POSSIBLE NARRATIVE OF THE CIVILIZATIONAL PATTERNS THAT LED TO THE HUMAN TRANSFORMATION OF THE PLANET, AND SHOWS THE LIMITS OF BUSINESS-AS-USUAL RESPONSES TO CONFRONTING THE GLOBAL CRISIS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE GEOLOGICAL TRANSITION, AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR LIMITED ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY AND JUSTICE IN THE ANTHROPOCENE. THE NARRATIVE DEPLOYED HERE HIGHLIGHTS THE CENTRALITY OF A PARTICULAR FORM OF VISION IN MODERNITY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HIERARCHIES THROUGH THE DI-VISION BETWEEN THE IN-DI-VIDUAL AND THE EXTERNAL WORLD, I.E. NATURE, WHICH IS UNTENABLE IN THE ANTHROPOCENE.
258	INSTITUTIONS ARE MADE UP OF THE INTERPLAY OF THREE COMPONENTS: (1) FORMAL RULES, (2) ACTUAL PRACTICES AND (3) NARRATIVES (THE TWO LATTER ONES ARE REFERRED TO JOINTLY AS INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS). HOWEVER, LAWYERS IN POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES DO NOT SEE LAW THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIST LENSES, BUT OFTEN NURTURE A FALSE AND SIMPLISTIC IDEA OF THE LAW: THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE THE SUM OF RULES, OFTEN DISREGARDING THE ACTUAL PRACTICES OF THE RULES' ADDRESSEES AND NARRATIVES ATTACHED TO THE LAW (ENCOMPASSING EVERYTHING FROM THE RAISON D'ETRE AND GOAL OF THE INSTITUTION, ITS SYMBOLISM, THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE SURROUNDING IT, AND SOCIAL ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE INSTITUTION). THIS RESTRICTED VIEW MAKES HUNGARIAN LAWYERS BLIND AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ALSO DEFENCELESS AGAINST RECENT AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES. INSTITUTION-BUILDING HAS BEEN A MODERATELY SUCCESSFUL FEAT IN HUNGARY. TO PUT IT MORE PESSIMISTICALLY, IT HAS PARTIALLY FAILED SINCE THE END OF SOCIALISM, IN PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL PRACTICES AND NARRATIVES. IN THE HUNGARIAN CONTEXT, CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEMS OF INSTITUTION-BUILDING SUGGESTS TWO GENERAL CONCLUSIONS: ON THE ONE HAND, THE LACK OF UNISON AMONG THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS (RULES, PRACTICES, NARRATIVES) RENDERS INSTITUTIONS LESS STABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY LESS CAPABLE OF INDUCING COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW; ON THE OTHER, THE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER PROSPERITY TO THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING OF 2010/11 FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INSTITUTION-BUILDING. THIS INSTITUTIONALIST VIEW OF THE LAW YIELDS TWO MAIN SPECIFIC FINDINGS: (1) HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT BESIDES HONEST DETERMINATION, THE RADICAL INSTITUTIONAL OVERHAUL OF A COMPLETE LEGAL SYSTEM CAN ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PRESENCE OF EXTERNAL PRESSURE, THE EFFECT OF WHICH HAS UNFORTUNATELY DECREASED WITH HUNGARY'S ACCESSION TO THE EU. THAT IS, INSTITUTION-BUILDING SHOULD GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL AND EU OBLIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN MORE SOBER POLITICAL MOMENTS TO GUARANTEE THAT THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY WILL NOT LATER ENTER INTO A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MODE. (2) TAKING ELEMENTS BEYOND MERE RULES MORE CONSCIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT, SUCH AS ACTUAL PRACTICES AND NARRATIVES IN THE REALM OF LEGISLATION, THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW AND LEGAL TRAINING WOULD IDEALLY RESULT IN THE GRADUAL REINFORCEMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE CULTURAL ELEMENTS. THIS, HOWEVER, REQUIRES POLITICAL ACTION, MORE PRECISELY THE ADJUSTMENT OF FORMAL RULES. SINCE THIS IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE INCUMBENT DECISION-MAKERS, OVERCOMING THE IMPASSE SEEMS UNLIKELY FOR THE TIME BEING.
259	MACRO-HISTORICAL CHANGES IN THE PRACTICES AND STRUCTURES OF ORGANIZED VIOLENCE HAVE THEIR OWN REGULARITIES THAT REQUIRE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE STEADY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE STRUCTURES ARE DETERMINED BY THE MAIN TRENDS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION SUCH AS DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH, THE EXPANSION AND COMPLICATION OF POLITIES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND WEAPONS. THE INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF BOTH THE CYCLICALITY AND THE DIRECTION AND IRREVERSIBILITY OF THESE CHANGES ARE CONSIDERED. THE PRACTICES OF ORGANIZED VIOLENCE HAVE CHANGED CONSIDERABLY, AND MANY OF THOSE UNACCEPTABLE TODAY WERE ONCE COMMON, SOCIALLY APPROVED, AND EVEN OBLIGATORY. HYPOTHETICAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN FORMULATED FOR THE EMERGENCE, SPREAD, AND TERMINATION OF SUCH PRACTICES, WHICH ARE ALWAYS CONNECTED WITH THE NATURE AND OUTCOME OF POLITICAL STRUGGLE, AS WELL AS WITH THE CHANGE OF WORLDVIEWS CONSISTING OF PRIMARILY MORAL, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES AND CORRESPONDING NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES. THE INEVITABLE COSTS OF THE GROWTH OF VIOLENCE STRUCTURES ARE ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEADERS GAINING POLITICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND CLAIMS TO POWER, WHICH IS FRAUGHT WITH CONSPIRACIES, REVOLTS, AND SIMILAR PHENOMENA THAT UNDERMINE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STABILITY. THESE COSTS GENERATE CONCERNS OF THE RULERS AND ELITES TO CONTROL THE VIOLENCE STRUCTURES. THREE BASIC FORMS OF SUCH CONTROL HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED AS "IDEAL TYPES," THOSE OF PATRIMONIAL-CHARISMATIC CONTROL BASED ON EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE RULER, CONFLICT-REPRESSIVE CONTROL WITH DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER STRATEGIES, AND BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL INVOLVING SUBORDINATION TO FORMAL RULES. THE LAST TYPE INCLUDES TWO VERSIONS, WITH A RELIANCE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF POWER AND ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LAW. THE SOCIAL AND MENTAL FOUNDATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW IN INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF STATE VIOLENCE ARE EXAMINED.
260	THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT HOW "SYSTEMIC" IRREGULARITIES OR BREACHES OF LAW IMPUTABLE TO EU MEMBER STATES ARE DEFINED IN KEY LEGAL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE EU BUDGET - NOTABLY WITH REGARDS TO AGRICULTURAL, STRUCTURAL AND RECOVERY FUNDS, AND WITH REGARDS TO THE CONDITIONALITY REGULATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT "SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES" ARISE WHERE THE FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE DAMAGED OR PUT AT RISK BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS MEANT TO PROTECT THESE INTERESTS IN A MEMBER STATE ARE CONSIDERED DEFICIENT THEMSELVES. THE SCOPE OF THESE SYSTEMS VARIES WITH DOCUMENTS: SOME SYSTEMS ARE DEFINED IN SECTORAL LEGISLATION AND ONLY HAVE RELEVANCE FOR SPECIFIC FUNDING PROGRAMMES; OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE A MORE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARACTER AND ARE LINKED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN EU MEMBER STATES. MOREOVER, THE SEVERITY OF SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES CAN BE GRADED ON A SCALE. THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS REGARDING THE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES WHICH CAN BE IMPOSED ON MEMBER STATES FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE EU BUDGET - HOW MUCH EU FUNDING SHOULD BE WITHHELD FROM THEM. IT IS ALSO ARGUED THAT THE RATIONALES UNDERLYING THE IMPOSITION OF FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES - PUTTING THE EU BUDGET OUT OF HARM'S WAY OR INCENTIVIZING CHANGE TO REDUCE RISK? - HAVE IMPLICATIONS PERTAINING TO THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES.
261	THIS PAPER SETS OUT WHY LAND EXPROPRIATION IS A HIDDEN DANGER OF THE RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE; A DANGER THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY CAPTURED IN LEGISLATION AND THAT RISKS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING THE POOR. MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE RISKS AND IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT ON STATES' ACCESS TO LAND. THE LEGAL MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH STATES CAN OBTAIN RIGHTS OVER LAND IS EXPROPRIATION, BUT A FAIR EXPROPRIATION PROCESS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS THAT ARE (PARTLY OR COMPLETELY) LACKING IN MANY COUNTRIES: EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF PEOPLE'S LAND RIGHTS; A LEGALLY DETAILED EXPROPRIATION PROCESS AND ADEQUATE ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT IT; AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE AFFECTED POPULATIONS. CLIMATE CHANGE EXACERBATES THE PROBLEMS THAT MANY STATES HAVE WITH THEIR EXPROPRIATION PROCESSES: IT BRINGS NEW AND MORE COMPLEX QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF EXPROPRIATION; PROVOKES MORE URGENT EXPROPRIATIONS; AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS THE POOREST PEOPLE. BASED ON LEGAL ANALYSIS AND EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, THIS PAPER LOOKS INTO THE CASE OF MOZAMBIQUE IN THE AFTERMATH OF CYCLONE IDAI TO SHOW HOW ISSUES RELATED WITH EXPROPRIATION ARE A HIDDEN DANGER FOR MANY MOZAMBICANS, BUT ALSO FOR CITIZENS OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.
262	ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS AGREE THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMOTING HIGH QUALITY FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FAVOURABLE CAPITAL MARKET OUTCOMES. WE TEST THREE NEW ENFORCEMENT PROXIES FROM BROWN, PREIATO AND TARCA (2014) THAT FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING ENFORCEMENT. WE EXAMINE FIRMS' INFORMATION ENVIRONMENTS, REPRESENTED BY THE ERROR IN ANALYSTS' CONSENSUS FORECASTS AND THE EXTENT OF DISAGREEMENT AMONG ANALYSTS, AS INDICATED BY FORECAST DISPERSION. FOR FINANCIAL YEARS ENDING FROM 2003 TO 2009, WE CONSTRUCT A SAMPLE OF 357,034 FIRM-MONTH OBSERVATIONS ON THE ERRORS AND DISPERSION OF ANALYSTS' EARNINGS FORECASTS FOR 10,769 FIRMS DOMICILED IN THOSE 39 COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT HIGHER SCORES FOR ALL THREE PROXIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER ERROR AND LESS DISAGREEMENT IN FORECASTS. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT THE INDICES HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPLANATORY POWER WHEN PREVIOUSLY USED ENFORCEMENT PROXIES (SUCH AS KAUFMANN ET AL.'S 2010 RULE OF LAW MEASURE) ARE INCLUDED IN THE REGRESSION MODELS, POINTING TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SPECIFIC MEASURES OF ACCOUNTING ENFORCEMENT. WE CONCLUDE THAT ACCOUNTING ENFORCEMENT MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT IN SECURING FAVOURABLE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES THAN HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REALISED, BECAUSE RESEARCHERS COMMONLY HAVE USED NOISIER, MORE GENERAL LEGAL PROXIES FOR ENFORCEMENT THAT UNDERSTATE ITS MARGINAL EFFECTS.
263	THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS WITNESSED A NUMBER OF CRISES IN RECENT YEARS: THE EUROCRISIS, THE WAR IN UKRAINE, COVID-19 AND A RULE OF LAW CRISIS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL AND HEALTH CRISES, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S LEGAL SYSTEM AND IN PARTICULAR THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS ALSO FACED A CRISIS OF AUTHORITY, LINKED TO BUT SEPARATE FROM THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS. AUTHORITY CONSTITUTES A SOCIAL RELATION INVOLVING A SUPERIOR, A SUBJECT AND A RANGE OF ACTION WHEREBY THE COMMANDS OF THE SUPERIOR PROVIDE INDEPENDENT REASONS FOR ACTION ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECT. THIS PAPER WILL ANALYSE THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN LIGHT OF THIS DEFINITION, ARGUING THAT ITS AUTHORITY FLOWS FROM ITS ROLE AS THE DEFINITIVE (OR AUTHORITATIVE) INTERPRETER OF UNION LAW, AMPLIFIED BY A SERIES OF JUDGMENTS ON THE NATURE OF THE UNION LEGAL ORDER AND UNDERPINNED BY A VISION OF THE UNION LEGAL ORDER AS AUTONOMOUS, EFFECTIVE AND INTEGRATED. ITS POSITION OF AUTHORITY RESTS ON NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND SUPREME COURTS SHARING THIS VISION OF THE UNION LEGAL ORDER AND ITS PRE-EMPTIVE CHARACTER VIS-A-VIS THEIR OWN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS. THIS PAPER WILL ANALYSE THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE VIS-A-VIS NATIONAL SUPREME AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT CHALLENGES POSED BY THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AMONGST OTHERS.
264	TODAY'S MOST ADVANCED SOCIETIES ARE STRUCTURED AROUND THREE NORMATIVE ELEMENTS: RULE OF LAW, MEETING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS, AND CONSTRAINED INEQUALITY. THESE ARE CULTURALLY DEEPLY ENTRENCHED TO THE POINT THAT CITIZENS ARE EXPECTED FULLY TO SUBORDINATE THEIR DIVERSE PERSONAL INTERESTS AND VALUES TO THEIR SHARED COMMITMENT TO THEIR SOCIETY'S JUST AND FAIR FUNCTIONING. THIS ENTRENCHED NORMATIVE EXPECTATION OF IMPARTIALITY IS SURPRISING: A MOTHER GIVING A FAVOR TO HER OWN BELOVED CHILD IS WIDELY DENOUNCED IF SHE DOES SO IN THE EXECUTION OF A PUBLIC OFFICE. HARSH AS SUCH CONDEMNATION OF NEPOTISM MAY APPEAR, IT IS A KEY PRECONDITION FOR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SOCIETIES YET CREATED. ARGUABLY, THE LONGTERM SURVIVAL OF HUMANITY REQUIRES AN ANALOGOUS CIVILIZATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT ON THE GLOBAL PLANE. THERE, AS WELL, JUST AND FAIR RULES AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CAN PERSIST ONLY IF THOSE ENTRUSTED WITH THEIR DESIGN AND OPERATION ARE EXPECTED TO BE STRICTLY IMPARTIAL IN THE EXECUTION OF THEIR PUBLIC ROLES AND HENCE WIDELY DENOUNCED FOR ANY FAVORITISM TOWARD THEIR HOME COUNTRY. REFLECTING A MERE MODUS VIVENDI, THE CURRENT STATE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS INVOLVES THE OPPOSITE EXPECTATION: THAT AGENTS OPERATING AT THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL WILL ACT TO ADVANCE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND VALUES OF THEIR HOME STATE. SUCH NATIONAL NEPOTISM PREVENTS THE EMERGENCE OF A WORLD ORDER BASED ON SHARED VALUES, WHICH HUMANITY URGENTLY NEEDS TO MASTER THE GREAT CHALLENGES POSED BY NATIONALLY CONTROLLED ADVANCED WEAPONS AND OTHER DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES, BY CLIMATE CHANGE, POLLUTION, AND RESOURCE DEPLETION, AND BY SUPRANATIONAL LOBBYING RESULTING IN INEFFICIENT AND UNSTABLE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN LEAD TO MASSIVE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.
265	THE VENEZUELAN SUPREME COURT HAS VOIDED ALMOST ALL OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY'S STATUTES AND OTHER DECISIONS IN 2016. THE OPPOSITION PARTIES OBTAINED A CLEAR VICTORY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS OF DECEMBER 2015 AND HAVE A DECISIVE MAJORITY IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. IN CONTRAST, THE SUPREME COURT RESPONDS TO THE INTERESTS OF THE VENEZUELA UNITED SOCIALIST PARTY. OBVIOUSLY POLITICAL CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE, BUT THE ARGUMENTS ARE CLOTHED IN CONSTITUTIONAL ROBES. THE CONFLICT IS USED TO ANALYZE THE ISSUES OF LEGITIMACY OF JUDGES AND LEGISLATIVE BODIES IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
266	THE RE-PROMULGATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IN 1908 UPTURNED THE LATE OTTOMAN POLITICAL SYSTEM, WHICH INCLUDED NOT JUST ITS POLITICAL STRUCTURE BUT ALSO THE BUREAUCRATIC SYSTEM. THOUSANDS OF BUREAUCRATS WERE DISMISSED FROM STATE SERVICE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POSITIONS. HAVING ORGANIZED THE PURGES WITH LIMITED POLITICAL POWER, THE COMMITTEE OF UNION OF PROGRESS (CUP) ACHIEVED A STRONG POLITICAL PROJECT THAT CONTRIBUTED TO CONTROLLING THE ACTUAL STATE APPARATUS. IN FACT, THE CONSENSUS IN THE LITERATURE IS THAT PURGING THE MASSES HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICE PREVALENT IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THIS, THUS, CHALLENGES THE WIDELY HELD NOTION THAT THE CUP'S LEADERSHIP PREFERRED INSPECTING THE GOVERNMENT FROM BACKSTAGE BEFORE 1913. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE CUP'S POWER IN ACTION DURING THE EARLY CONSTITUTIONAL PERIOD. FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE TENSIKAT LAW, THIS STUDY PRIMARILY EXAMINES THE LEGISLATIVE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE CUP TO DEFINE THE NATURE OF POWER RELATIONS SHARED BY VARIOUS ACTORS.
267	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF PERSECUTION BY STUDYING THE INTENSITY OF THE BLACK DEATH POGROMS IN THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT COMMUNITIES GOVERNED BY ARCHBISHOPRICS, BISHOPRICS, AND IMPERIAL FREE CITIES EXPERIENCED MORE INTENSE AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS THAN DID THOSE GOVERNED BY THE EMPEROR. WE SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL FRAGMENTATION EXACERBATED COMPETITION FOR THE RENTS GENERATED BY JEWISH MONEYLENDING, WHICH MADE JEWS MORE VULNERABLE DURING PERIODS OF CRISIS.
268	CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO CHINESE LEGAL ACADEMIA IN LATE 1980'S, AND GAINED GREAT ATTENTIONS IN THE FOLLOWING DECADE. LATER ON, HOWEVER, CHINESE JURISTS SHOWED LITTLE INTEREST IN EXPLORING MORE OF CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARS AS INDETERMINISTS, DECONSTRUCTIONISTS, EXTREMISTS AND NIHILISTS. THIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE TYPICAL, GROSS MISCONCEPTIONS OF CHINESE JURISTS TO CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, AND EXPLORES THE REASONS OF SUCH MISCONCEPTIONS. THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE HOPES THAT HIS REPRESENTATION OF CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP WOULD HELP TO REOPEN THE DOOR FOR FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND THEIR AUDIENCES IN CHINA. REMARKS ON HOW TO APPROACH CRITICAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP FURTHER FROM A CHINESE PERSPECTIVE ARE PROVIDED AT THE END OF THIS ARTICLE.
269	THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE SCOURGE OF CORRUPTION, COMMITTED BY OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC SERVANTS, HAVE BEEN DELEGITIMIZING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW IN PERU DURING THE PERIOD 2010 -2022.
270	THE SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE COVERAGE OF GUARANTEES OF PUBLIC SERVICES LOYALTY IN UKRAINE. IT IS PROPOSED TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF GUARANTEES TO ENSURE THE LOYALTY OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN UKRAINE: APPEALS OF DECISIONS, ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ENTITIES ON THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN COURT (ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS); CONTROL OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ENTITIES ON THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES; APPEALS OF INDIVIDUALS (CITIZENS AND STATELESS PERSONS) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF UKRAINE "ON APPEALS OF CITIZENS"; BRINGING PUBLIC SERVANTS TO RESPONCIBILITY FOR REFUSING TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN TYPE OF PUBLIC SERVICE. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LEGAL GUARANTEES OF LOYALTY OF PUBLIC SERVICES PROVISION LIE IN: ASSURANCE OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF A HUMAN AND A CITIZEN IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING VARIOUS PUBLIC SERVICES; COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC SERVICES; IMPROVING THE STATE IMAGE REPRESENTED BY SUBJECTS OF THESE SERVICES; IMPROVING THE LEGAL AWARENESS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICES, WHICH WILL BE MANIFESTED IN STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE; IMPROVING THE MECHANISM OF PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICES BY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ENTITIES, ETC.
271	HOW TO RESTORE CITIZENS' TRUST AND COOPERATION WITH THE POLICE IN THE WAKE OF CIVIL WAR? WE REPORT RESULTS FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF THE LIBERIAN NATIONAL POLICE'S (LNP) "CONFIDENCE PATROLS" PROGRAM, WHICH DEPLOYED TEAMS OF NEWLY RETRAINED, BETTER-EQUIPPED POLICE OFFICERS ON RECURRING PATROLS TO RURAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS THREE LIBERIAN COUNTIES OVER A PERIOD OF 14 MONTHS. WE FIND THAT THE PROGRAM INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF THE POLICE AND LIBERIAN LAW, ENHANCED SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND REDUCED THE INCIDENCE OF SOME TYPES OF CRIME, NOTABLY SIMPLE ASSAULT AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE PROGRAM DID NOT, HOWEVER, IMPROVE TRUST IN THE POLICE, COURTS, OR GOVERNMENT MORE GENERALLY. WE ALSO OBSERVE HIGHER RATES OF CRIME REPORTING IN TREATMENT COMMUNITIES, CONCENTRATED ALMOST ENTIRELY AMONG THOSE WHO WERE DISADVANTAGED UNDER PREVAILING CUSTOMARY MECHANISMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION. WE CONSIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR POST-CONFLICT POLICING IN LIBERIA AND WEAK AND WAR-TORN STATES MORE GENERALLY.
272	RESEARCH WITH HUNDREDS OF MOSTLY INDIGENOUS MAYA WORKERS IN THE EXPORT PROCESSING PLANTS (MAQUILAS) OF HIGHLAND GUATEMALA HAS REVEALED A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE FACTORIES, PERCEIVED RIGHTS, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LABOR LAWS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS DISJUNCTION, EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE PLIGHT OF WORKERS MUST ENGAGE THE COMPLEX CONDITIONS OF THE CURRENT LABOR REGIMES. MAQUILAS OPERATE IN CONTEXTS THAT ARE VIRTUALLY EXEMPT FROM REGULATION AND CONFLATE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ORDERS, PRECLUDING A CLEAR PERSPECTIVE ON ISSUES OF RIGHTS AND LEGAL CLAIMS. IN THE NEW GEOGRAPHIES OF POWER, WORKERS IN TRANSNATIONAL FACTORIES FALL INTO THE INTERSTICES BETWEEN STATE AND NONSTATE SPACES AND LOSE THEIR RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS IN THE PROCESS.
273	THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE LAW AND ITS ROLE IN THE POLITICAL STABILITY OF THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN. IN ADDITION, IT AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE RULE OF JUSTICE'S LAW IN PROTECTING ALL CITIZENS TO OBTAIN THEIR RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, WHETHER CIVIL, ECONOMIC, OR POLITICAL. ALSO, THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO RECOGNIZE THE JORDANIAN LAW TEXTS HELPING STABILIZE THE POLITICAL SITUATION AND TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES WITH CONFIDENCE AND SOLIDITY TO ACHIEVE GROWTH AND PROSPERITY. THE RESEARCHER USED THE INDUCTIVE METHOD, THROUGH HER RESEARCH BY INVESTIGATING IN SEVERAL BOOKS OF LAW, AND ALSO THROUGH HER WORK AND EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF LAW, AND AS A PROFESSOR IN ONE OF THE JORDANIAN UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS THROUGH HER LIFE AS A CITIZEN IN THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN. THE RESEARCHER CONCLUDED THAT THE JORDANIAN LAW HAD A GREAT IMPACT ON THE POLITICAL STABILITY OF THE STATE FROM WITHIN.
274	THIS RESEARCH PAPER DESCRIBES THE TRAINING OF LAWYERS IN LAW SCHOOL, TAKING AS A STARTING POINT A MEMORISTIC AND ENCYCLOPEDIC TEACHING TRANSLATED INTO A TRANSMISSIONIST PEDAGOGICAL MODEL, TO THE INCLUSION OF PRACTICAL ACTIVITIES THE LEGAL STUDIES, KNOWN AS CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION AND INFLUENCED BY IDEOLOGIES OF LEGAL REALISM, MORE CONSISTENT WITH A SOCIAL PEDAGOGIC MODEL. HOWEVER THERE IS A NEED FOR A LAW STUDENT COMMITTED TO THE SOCIAL ORDER AND THEREFORE IT IS PROPOSED THAT CLINICAL LEGAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE A CURRICULUM THAT WOULD ENABLE THE POPULARIZATION OF THE LAW, AS IT ALSO PROVIDES A PRACTICAL EDUCATION OF THE LAW FROM THE ACADEMIC POINT OF VIE. THIS CAN PROVIDE BOTH ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITED ECONOMIC RESOURCES, AS THE APPROPRIATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF PARTICULAR LEGAL CASES, A PROCESS IN WHICH UNIVERSITY TEACHING IS PRESENT AS A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TOOL THAT WILL MAKE THIS PROCESS POSSIBLE.
275	RECENT POLITICAL SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINING THE INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OF THE RIGHTS REVOLUTION HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES A LESS WELL-KNOWN LINE OF SUPREME COURT CASES CONCERNING GOVERNMENT LIABILITY THAT HAVE UNDERMINED EFFECTIVE PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. I EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE COURT'S "PROCEDURAL ASSAULT" ON PRIVATE CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT AND POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO THE RECENT PROTESTS IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI, AND ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE COUNTRY REGARDING POLICE USE OF FORCE. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE WAYS IN WHICH THE COURT HAS UNDERMINED A CORE STRAND OF THE RIGHTS REVOLUTION, I ASSESS THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS AS THEY RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS.
276	THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF HISTORICAL LEGACIES OF THE HABSBURG AND OTTOMAN EMPIRES ON DEMAND FOR LITIGATION IN CONTEMPORARY ROMANIA IN CRIMINAL CASES. IT FINDS THAT NOWADAYS A KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO HISTORICAL ZONES IS THAT IN THE HABSBURG COUNTIES DEMAND FOR LITIGATION INCREASES IF THE INCOME GOES UP; IN THE OTTOMAN COUNTIES, HOWEVER, THE DEMAND REMAINS CONSTANT. FURTHERMORE, THE DEMAND FOR LITIGATION IN POOR COUNTIES IS SMALLER IN HABSBURG THAN IN OTTOMAN COUNTIES. WE PROVIDE SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS TO THIS PHENOMENON AND COMPARE IT TO THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF CULTURE OF JUDICIAL APPEALS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
277	IN 2003, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC LAUNCHED ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS REFORMS IN LATIN AMERICA FOR ITS PRISON SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED IN THE SO-CALLED NEW PRISONS, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN PRISONERS' CONDITIONS AND EXPERIENCES -INCLUDING VARIATION BY RACE AND NATIONAL ORIGIN. APPROXIMATELY 10 % OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC ARE FOREIGNERS, THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE HAITIAN NATIONALS. DUE LARGELY TO DIPLOMATIC DISPUTES OVER LEGAL STATUS OF HAITIAN MIGRANTS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, HAITIAN PRISONERS FACE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING LACK OF LEGAL DOCUMENTATION, POVERTY, LITTLE ACCESS TO LAWYERS, AND LANGUAGE DIFFERENCES. THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON DATA FROM A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2017-2018 IN 17 DOMINICAN PRISONS, WITH A SAMPLE OF OVER 1,200 SURVEY RESPONSES. OVER 100 INTERVIEWS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED DURING THIS PERIOD. AFTER ANALYZING THE CONDITIONS OF HAITIANS INCARCERATED IN DOMINICAN PRISONS, COMPARED TO DOMINICANS AND TO OTHER FOREIGN NATIONALS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE OBSTACLES AND OPPORTUNITIES RAISED BY THE STRATEGIES ADOPTED BY THE HAITIAN AND DOMINICAN GOVERNMENTS, IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVING THE CONDITIONS AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR HAITIANS WHO ARE INCARCERATED.
278	THE FORMATION OF THE STATE-LEGAL SYSTEM IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A MODEL. THIS IS CONVENIENT FOR A MORE DETAILED STUDY OF HISTORICAL AND LEGAL PROCESSES. THIS MODEL DOES NOT COMPLETELY COINCIDE WITH HISTORICAL REALITY, BUT IT REFLECTS THE MAIN LAWS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE STATE AND LAW. THIS PROCESS IS CONSIDERED ON THE EXAMPLE OF MEDIEVAL CASTILE. THERE THE LAW DEVELOPED IN A SPIRAL. DEVELOPED LEGAL FORMS INHERITED FROM ROME WERE REPLACED BY PRIMITIVE BARBARIC LAW, AND THEN RETURNED TO THE PATTERNS PROPOSED BY ROMAN LAW, BUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL. THIS EVOLUTION CORRESPONDED TO THE FORMATION OF STATE (PUBLIC) POWER. IN THE DESCRIBED MODEL, THE FOLLOWING STAGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED. ROMANIZATION OF THE LOCAL POPULATION, THE ARRIVAL OF ROMAN LAW. VISIGOTHIC CONQUEST, THE CREATION OF VULGAR ROMAN LAW MIXED WITH GERMANIC CUSTOMS. THE ARAB CONQUEST, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EMERGING SYSTEM. CASTILE'S ABANDONMENT OF THE PREVIOUS LEGAL SYSTEM, A RETURN TO REGULATION BY CUSTOM. FIXING CUSTOMS IN COURT DECISIONS, THE EMERGENCE OF PRECEDENTS (FAZANAS). THE INFLUENCE OF THE ROYAL ADMINISTRATION ON THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED STATE-LEGAL SYSTEM, THE CREATION OF FUERO. DEVELOPMENT OF ROYAL WRITTEN LAW BY MEANS OF ABSTRACT RULES OF LAW. THE PECULIARITY OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS A FACT THAT PERIODS COULD NOT BE RIGIDLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER. LEGAL FORMS AT EACH STAGE COEXISTED AND INTERACTED. EACH INSTRUMENT REGULATED LEGAL RELATIONS IN ITS OWN SPHERE. ANOTHER FEATURE IS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW WENT FROM A NARRATIVE (A STORY ABOUT LAW, SATURATED WITH EMOTIONS, VALUES, MORALITY) TO AN ABSTRACT FACELESS RULE OF LAW, THE SOURCE OF WHICH WAS PUBLIC POWER.
279	GROWTH OF EMERGING ECONOMIES, POLICY COMMITMENTS TO BIOFUELS AND VOLATILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A MARKED INCREASE IN THE PACE AND SCALE OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN LAND-BASED ENTERPRISES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICY AND PRACTICE ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMARY RIGHTS PROTECTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF LARGE-SCALE LAND ACQUISITIONS THROUGH A DOCUMENT REVIEW AND CASE STUDY ANALYSES FROM GHANA, MOZAMBIQUE, TANZANIA, AND ZAMBIA. FINDINGS POINT TO THE DIFFICULTY OF SAFEGUARDING CUSTOMARY RIGHTS EVEN IN COUNTRIES PROVIDING "BEST PRACTICE" LEGAL PROTECTIONS, AND POINT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF HUMAN AGENCY IN SHAPING OUTCOMES.

280	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE NORWEGIAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT 'HJEMMEFRONTEN' (THE HOME FRONT, HF) AS A POLITICAL INTEREST GROUP DURING THE EXILE GOVERNMENT'S FORMULATION OF PROVISIONAL LAWS MEANT FOR THE POSTWAR RECKONING WITH NORWEGIAN COLLABORATORS AND FOREIGN WAR CRIMINALS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE RESISTANCE THROUGH ITS JUDICIAL COMMITTEE IN OSLO HAD A DECISIVE IMPACT ON THE FINAL VERSIONS OF THREE DECREES THAT, THOUGH CONSTITUTIONALLY CONTESTED, FORMED MOST OF THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE JUDICIAL SETTLEMENT AFTER 1945. IT IS SHOWN HOW THE INTERVENTION OF THE HF IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS DURING 1944 AND 1945 EXACERBATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENAL DECREES PASSED IN LONDON. COMPARED TO OTHER WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OCCUPIED BY NAZI GERMANY THE INFLUENCE OF THE RESISTANCE OVER THE WORDING OF TREASON LAWS ALMOST CERTAINLY IS UNIQUE.
281	AS HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE INCREASINGLY GAINED IMPORTANCE AT THE EUROPEAN UNION LEVEL, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE REMAINING SCOPE OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION UNDER THE EU-UK TRADE AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT. WHILE SOME INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS REMAIN APPLICABLE, THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DID NOT BECOME PART OF THE TRADE AND COOPERATION AGREEMENT (TCA). THE CONSEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE INTERNATIONALISED NE BIS IN IDEM PRINCIPLE, ARE ANALYSED. FURTHERMORE, THE CONDITIONALITY OF THE TCA IN GENERAL AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONALITY FOR JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS ARE DISCUSSED. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE RISK THAT COOPERATION MAY CEASE AT ANY MOMENT IF ANY MEMBER STATE OR THE UK LEAVE THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS HIGHLIGHTED. LASTLY, THE AUTHORS RAISE THE PROBLEM OF THE LACK OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, AS THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS NO LONGER COMPETENT.
282	THE ARTICLE RAISES THE ISSUE ON THE TRANSFORMATIONAL JUSTICE RELATING TO THE THEORY OF POLICY TOWARDS THE PAST. THE LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH CAN NOT ONLY ALLOW TO EXACT COMPENSATION FOR THE HARMFUL HISTORY BUT ALSO BE USED TO OPPOSE IT ACTIVELY, PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF COMING TO TERMS WITH HISTORY. TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, IN ORDER TO COMPREHEND HOW THE INSTRUMENT OF LAW WAS USED BY THE STATE IN THE TRANSFORMATIONAL JUSTICE PROCESS, ONE SHOULD REFER TO THE JURISPRUDENCE. AN OVERVIEW OF THE POST-WAR ERA PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL DEBATE OVER THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IS CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHOR TO BE A STARTING POINT TO FORMULATE A GENERAL CONCEPT OF THE NECESSITY OF REFERRING TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW IN ANY PROCESS OF SETTLING ACCOUNTS WITH THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, THE OTHER COUNTRIES' EXPERIENCE WHICH WENT THROUGH THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS, AS WELL AS THEIR SCHOLARLY ACHIEVEMENTS, MAY ALSO BE OF INVALUABLE HELP TO POLAND WITH ITS DIFFICULTIES IN SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH THE DIFFICULT PAST.
283	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE USE AND MEANING THAT FRANCISCO ZARCO ASSIGNED TO SOME OF THE KEY CONCEPTS OF HIS POLITICAL THOUGHT DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF HIS LIFE. FOR THIS, THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED DURING THIS PERIOD IN EL SIGLO DIEZ Y NUEVE WERE ANALYZED, PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY WERE WRITTEN. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO DELVE INTO THE RICHNESS AND COMPLEXITY OF THE POLITICAL THOUGHT OF THE INTELLECTUAL FROM DURANGO, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS, NOT ONLY TO THE PREVAILING LIBERALISM OF THE TIME, BUT ALSO TO OTHER IDEOLOGICAL CORPUS, SUCH AS DEMOCRACY AND REPUBLICANISM.
284	CONTEMPORARY DEBATES ABOUT THE ROLE OF LAW IN DEVELOPMENT OFTEN HEAD IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THE FIRST CONSIDERS QUESTIONS OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT' AND ASKS: HOW CAN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE HELP STRENGTHEN LAWS AND JUSTICE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES? A SECOND, MORE RECENT FOCUS INVOLVES THE 'LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT', AND QUESTIONS HOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DEVELOPMENT IS OR SHOULD BE REGULATED BY LAW. THIS PAPER ARGUES FOR THE NEED TO MAKE A GREATER LINK BETWEEN THOSE LINES OF DEBATE. A SERIES OF REAL-LIFE SCENARIOS ARE PRESENTED TO SHOW HOW ENSURING LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE DEPENDS ON WELL-FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEMS IN COUNTRIES RECEIVING ASSISTANCE. AS A RESULT, BOTH DONORS AND RECIPIENT COUNTRIES MAY HAVE TO CONFRONT CHALLENGES IN PROMOTING APPROPRIATE LEGAL SYSTEMS IF THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT REGULATING DEVELOPMENT. CONVERSELY, A FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND SUFFICIENTLY THE REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENT COULD LEAD TO UNREALISTIC OR THIN ACCOUNTS OF HOW TO PROMOTE LAWS AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
285	THIS ARTICLE ENGAGES ONE OF THE IMPORTANT GAPS IN THE LITERATURE ON PARTY SYSTEM EFFECTS: THE CONSEQUENCES OF PARTY SYSTEM CHANGE. WE DISCUSS HOW EXISTING EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO PARTY SYSTEM CHANGE DO NOT ACTUALLY CAPTURE THE CHANGEABILITY OF PATTERNS OF PARTY COMPETITION, WHICH IS THE MOST DIRECT UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM "PARTY SYSTEM." WE PROPOSE A MEASURE THAT DOES EXACTLY THIS: THE INDEX OF FLUIDITY. APPLYING THIS MEASURE TO COUNTRIES IN SOUTH EAST ASIA, WE SHOW THAT PARTY SYSTEM CHANGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HARMFUL EFFECTS, INCLUDING LOWER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND DETERIORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
286	IN MODERN SOCIETIES PLURALISM DOES NOT SPONTANEOUSLY LEAD TO SENSUS COMMUNIS BUT TO RELATIVISM: MY TRUTH, MY MORALITY, MY RELIGION - AND: MY RIGHTS. THE RESULTING CONLICTS CANNOT BE RESOLVED ON THE BASIS OF PRIVATE MORALITY AND RELIGION - SUCH AS IN CHRISTIANITY OR ISLAM. CONLICTS CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY MEANS OF A LAW THAT IS EQUAL FOR EVERYONE. A LAW THAT IS EQUAL AND JUST CAN ONLY BE ENFORCED IN A PARTICULAR FORM OF THE STATE - IN A STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THIS STATE HAS THE SOURCES OF THE NORMS TO WHICH EVERYONE IS BOUND IN THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF HUMAN RIGHTS. KANT ESTABLISHES THE IDEA OF COSMOPOLITANISM IN A LEGAL SENSE, NOT THROUGH ETHICS, BUT THROUGH THE THEORY OF LAW. THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN HIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL REALISM AND HIS IDEALISTIC METAPHYSICAL JUSTIICATION OF LAW THROUGH REASON. IT IS POINTLESS TO CRITICIZE HIS IDEALISM. IT IS MORE PROITABLE TO PUT FORWARD A RE-READING THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW KANT CAN GAIN IN CONTEMPORARY SIGNIICANCE IF HIS METAPHYSICAL JUSTIICATIONS ARE DISPENSED WITH. IN THE INTEREST OF CURRENT THEORIES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE STATE, KANT'S THEORY OF RIGHTS OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A PRAGMATIC FUNCTIONAL THEORY. KANT'S CRITICAL ANTHROPOLOGY REQUIRES A COSMOPOLITANISM THAT DOES NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE LAW OF HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT WHICH FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF A CRITIQUE OF THE STATE AND ECONOMIC VIOLENCE.
287	WE HEREBY OFFER A NUMBER OF REFLECTIONS ON THE REFERENDUM AS THE ULTIMATE DEMOCRATIC TOOL, IN ORDER TO MAKE EMPHASIS ON ITS BITS AND BOBS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW TO BE LOOKED AT.
288	IN THE LAST DECADESWE HAVE WITNESS THE RE-OPENING OF THE DEBATES ON A POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR TORTURE, AS WELL AS A GROWING AND WELL-FOUNDED CONSCIENCE OF THE NEED OF ITS TOTALABOLITION. THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT EXPLORING AND REVISITING FOR CRITICISM THE DISCOURSES AND POLICIES BEHIND THE SUPPORT TO SUCH A DEGRADING PRACTICE.
289	EUGEN PUSIC WAS A MEMBER OF THE CROATIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND ARTS FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS. THE PAPER DESCRIBES HIS ROLE AND ANALYSES HIS FUNCTIONS IN THIS INSTITUTION. PUSIC'S FUNCTIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF THE ACADEMY INCLUDED THE POST OF DEPARTMENT'S SECRETARY; THE POSITION OF EDITOR OF THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL RAD; THE POSITION OF HEAD OF THE CABINET FOR LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCES JURAJ KRIZANIC; THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT OF THE WORKING GROUP LAW AND SOCIETY BASIC RESEARCH; ETC. HE ALSO WORKED ON THE DOCUMENTS THROUGH WHICH THE ACADEMY ADDRESSED THE PUBLIC (HE INITIATED THE EDITION CROATIA - GIVENS AND ORIENTATIONS, COORDINATED THE PROJECT, AND WAS AN EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER; HE WAS ONE OF THE INITIATORS OF THE DECLARATION ON KNOWLEDGE IN 2002, ETC.). FURTHER, HE WAS ACTIVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COUNCIL FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION, JUDICIARY, AND THE RULE OF LAW (HE INITIATED ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 2004 AND PRESENTED PAPERS AT 8 OUT OF 11 ROUND TABLES, FOLLOWED BY THE BOOKS). PROFESSOR PUSIC WAS ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES HE PREPARED SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES, LECTURES, PUBLIC DEBATES AND WAS ACTIVE IN MANY OTHER FIELDS.
290	THE ESSAY PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF A DEBATE THAT HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE PRIMARILY ON THE COLUMNS OF A BLOG SYMPOSIUM ON THE PRESTIGIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BLOG VERFASSUNGSBLOG ON CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION IN HUNGARY. GIVEN THAT HUNGARY IS THE POSTER CHILD FOR HYBRID, ILLIBERAL REGIMES, THE DISCUSSION TRANSCENDS HUNGARY AND GIVES INSIGHTFUL AD- DITIONS TO THE ILLIBERALISM LITERATURE, TARGETING AN AUDIENCE BEYOND LEGAL SCHOLARS. THE STARTING POINT OF THE DEBATE PERTAINS TO THE CLASSIC DILEMMA OF LEGAL POSITIVISM VS. NATU- RAL LAW, AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER CONSTITUTIONAL RULES OF DUBIOUS DEMOCRATIC NATURE CAN BE REPLACED IN VIOLATION OF LEGALITY, FOR EXAMPLE IN AN EXTRA -PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 'HYBRID REGIMES', OR 'ELECTIVE AUTOCRACIES' AND THE PHENOMENON ON OF 'ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM' PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK AND SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION DEBATE, AS IT IS PLACED IN REGIMES INSTITUTIONALIZE 'HEGEMONIC PRESERVATION', 'AUTHORITARIAN ENCLAVES' AND 'BIONIC APPOINTMENTS' HIJACKING THE VOCABULARY AND IMAGI- NATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND ENTRENCHING LEGAL PROVISIONS WHICH REMAIN BE- YOND THE REACH OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS. THE FIRST PART PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL SCENE. THE SECOND PART FIRST DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THREE DIMENSIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION -DEBATE: THEORETICAL, POLITICAL AND PRO- CEDURAL, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DISCUSSES TWO FOCAL POINTS OF THE SYMPOSIUM: THE ROLE OF CON- STITUTIONS IN ILLIBERAL REGIMES AND IN CONSTITUTIONAL RESURRECTION, AND THE ROLE OF INTERNA- TIONAL AND EU LAW AS A TOOL FOR A LEGAL REVOLUTION.
291	BRAZIL DESCENDED INTO A MAJOR POLITICAL CRISIS AFTER THE 2013 MASS DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST ELECTORAL CORRUPTION AND FAILURE TO FULFIL CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS. THIS TURMOIL DESTABILIZED THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND SEVERELY IMPACTED THE BEHAVIOUR OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE USE OF POLITICAL MANDATES AND INSTITUTIONAL PREROGATIVES, CONTRARY TO ESTABLISHED SOCIAL NORMS AND TRADITIONAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW, BECAME UNEXCEPTIONAL. IN THIS ARTICLE, OPERATION CAR WASH, THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT DILMA ROUSSEFF, AND THE PROCESS TO SAVE THE MANDATE OF HER SUCCESSOR, PRESIDENT MICHEL TEMER, ARE ANALYSED AS SUCCESSIVE EXAMPLES OF' CONSTITUTIONAL HARDBALL' THAT DOMINATED BRAZILIAN POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL LIFE, LEADING THE COUNTRY TO A PERIOD OF 'CONSTITUTIONAL MALAISE' OR 'CONSTITUTIONAL REGRESSION.' THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THIS CYCLE OF INSTITUTIONAL RETALIATIONS, ROOTED IN THE CLASH BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL ESTABLISHMENTS (REPRESENTED BY OPERATION CAR WASH), ON THE STABILITY OF BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
292	ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA SEEMS TO BE COMMONPLACE UNDER THE GUISE OF CULTURE AND RELIGION. THIS RESEARCH EXPLORED THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND CULTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME. PERCEPTIONS OF DIFFERENCES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WERE ASSESSED WITH A VIEW TO FINDING AN INTERFACE WITH THE UNIVERSAL REGIME. THE STUDY BUILDS ON SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS USING ACADEMIC JOURNALS, BOOKS, AND ONLINE PUBLICATIONS. IN CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THE KEY QUESTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS SEEMS TO BE WHETHER IT IS THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OR COLLECTIVE RIGHTS THAT SHOULD HAVE PRIMACY IN POLITY GOVERNANCE. WHAT IS STRIKING IS THAT MOST AFRICAN DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONS RECOGNIZE THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, THE NON-APPLICATION OF THIS HAS LED TO DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE AND THIS PARADOX IS A SOURCE OF BAD GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE BEST RADAR TO ENSURE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS WOULD BE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL RIGHTS IN AFRICA.
293	MARTIN KRYGIER GROUNDS HIS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN A VISCERAL AVERSION TO UNTEMPERED POWER. THIS ESSAY DEPLOYS THESE CONCEPTS IN A PORTRAIT OF WAYS CHINA'S NOTABLE LAWYER ACTIVISTS CONFRONT POWER IN THIS MOST CONSEQUENTIAL SITE OF STRUGGLE AT THE PRESENT HISTORICAL MOMENT. DRAWING HEAVILY ON THE WORDS OF LAWYERS IN THE VANGUARD OF DEFENSE OF BASIC LEGAL FREEDOMS, THE ESSAY SKETCHES BRIEFLY HOW CHINA'S NOTABLE ACTIVIST LAWYERS CONSTRUE THE "UNCONTROL, UNPREDICTABILITY, AND UNRESPECT" OF UNBRIDLED POWER AS IT IS EXERCISED BY THE INSATIABLE MONOPOLY OF CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTY, ITS FAILURES TO ERECT CHECKS AND BALANCES WHEN RESTRAINT OF POWER IS MOST CRITICAL, ITS DEPLOYMENT OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW TO LEGITIMIZE THE ABUSE OF POWER, ITS RELIANCE ON UNTAMED INSTITUTIONS OF A POLICE STATE, AND ITS DISEMPOWERING OF CIVIL SOCIETY AS A FUNDAMENTAL BUTTRESS FOR RULE OF LAW. IN THE SPIRIT OF KRYGIER, THE ESSAY CONCLUDES WITH LAWYERS' VISION OF TEMPERED POWER THROUGH RULE OF LAW IN CHINA.
294	IN THE 1988 CHARTER, ENVIRONMENTAL PRO-TECTION EXPRESSES CONSTITUENT COMMANDS THAT ARE NOT OPTIONAL AND COMPEL ALL GOVER-NMENTSTRUCTURES, AS WELL AS SOCIETY, TO ASSU-ME POSTURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DICTATES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, BELONGING TO THE CORE OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY. THE COMPETITION OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONO-MIC INTERESTS, ALSO SAFEGUARDED BY THE CONS-TITUTIONAL TEXT, WITH THE PROTECTION OF NATU-RAL RESOURCES AIMED AT A DIGNIFIED EXISTENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS, CONTEXTUALIZES DEFICIENCIES AND OMISSIONS IN THE PROVISION OF ENVIRONMEN-TAL POLICIES THAT REQUIRE A REACTION FROM THE CONSTITUTED POWERS SO THAT THE UNCONSTITU-TIONAL FAULT IS NOT PERPETUATED. JURISDICTION REPRESENTS ONE OF THE WAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTITUTION, FORMALLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY LEGITIMIZED BY THE PRIN-CIPLES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, AS ILLUSTRATED BY RECENT BRAZILIAN COURTS' APPROACHES TO THE SILENCE OR DEFAULT BY THE BRAZILIAN LEGISLATOR OR EXECUTIVE POWER. THE CHANGE IN TRADITIO-NAL PARADIGMS, HOWEVER, AFFECTS LEGAL RELA-TIONSHIPS AND IS NOT IMMUNE TO CRITICISM, WHICH REQUIRES REFLECTION AND ANALYSIS BY THE LEGAL COMMUNITY. THE STUDY USES THE DE-DUCTIVE METHOD, PROPOSING TO EXAMINE THE PROBLEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEOCONSTITUTIO-NAL GUIDELINES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AND CARRIES OUT EXPLORATORY, BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND DOCUMENTAL RESEARCH TO APPRECIATE RE-CENT JURISDICTIONAL CONSTRUCTIONS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEC-TION IN BRAZIL.
295	THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SHANGHAI PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE IMMEDIATELY HIT INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC HEADLINES. ON FACE VALUE, THE FREE TRADE ZONE IS A VARIATION TO THE LONG-ESTABLISHED SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES SET UP BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MORE THAN THREE DECADES AGO IN ORDER TO ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA. IN SUBSTANCE, THE FREE TRADE ZONE IS USED BY CHINA'S NEW LEADERSHIP AS A MORE AMBITIOUS TESTING GROUND FOR MORE LIBERAL ECONOMIC REFORMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS NOT ONLY INTO THESE DEEPENING ECONOMIC REFORMS BUT ALSO INTO THE INHERENT POLITICAL DIFFICULTIES AND SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPLEMENTING THESE PLANS FROM A LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE.
296	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE INTERPRETIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF LEGISLATIVE INACTION. SECTION I CONSIDERS THE NATURE OF ARGUMENTS BASED ON LEGISLATIVE INACTION. SECTION II EXPLORES THE PRACTICAL, CONCEPTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS WITH TRYING TO RELY ON LEGISLATIVE INACTION AS AN INTERPRETIVE AID. SECTION III CONCLUDES THAT ATTEMPTS TO DRAW INFERENCES FROM LEGISLATIVE INACTION ALONE ARE DEEPLY FLAWED, BUT THAT INFERENCES MIGHT LEGITIMATELY BE DRAWN FROM INACTION IF IT FORMS PART OF THE CONTEXT AGAINST WHICH THE LEGISLATION IS ENACTED. EVEN THEN, HOWEVER, THERE ARE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN DETERMINING WHAT INFERENCES TO DRAW.
297	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES SEVERAL AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES IN SYRIA SINCE 1971 AND DEMONSTRATES THAT, SINCE THE 2011 UPRISING, ITS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME HAS SUCCESSFULLY REMAINED RESILIENT INSTEAD OF COLLAPSING. THE POST-2011 SYRIAN GOVERNMENT UNDER AL-ASSAD IS NO LONGER THE BA'THIST GOVERNMENT OF OLD, ALBEIT STILL AUTOCRATIC BUT ADEPT AT ADAPTING TO HOSTILE CHANGING POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS. AL-ASSAD'S REGIME NO LONGER RELIES ON BA'ATH PARTY LOYALTY AND APPEARANCES OF LEGITIMACY BUT BOTH DURING AND POST-WAR HAS DEPENDED MORE ON SOCIAL RE-ENGINEERING TO SUSTAIN ITS POLITICAL, ECONOMIC POWER. THE SYRIA EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES THAT, WHEN THREATENED, AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES MAY THICKEN THE LAYERS OF THEIR AUTOCRATIC RULE TO SUSTAIN THEIR GRIP ON POWER, EVEN CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF ITS CITIZENRY TO CREATE A NEW POPULATION TO RULE. WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS USED URBAN PLANNING, HOUSING, AND PROPERTY LAWS TO RE-ENGINEER ITS DEMOGRAPHICS SO THAT FRIENDLY FOREIGN NATIONALS WILL RECEIVE PERMANENT CITIZENSHIP AND DISPLACE INDIGENOUS CITIZENS.
298	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES COLON-RIOS'S RECONSTRUCTION OF THE IDEA OF CONSTITUENT POWER IN RELATION TO HIS INTERPRETATIONS OF ROUSSEAU AND SCHMITT. IT DISTINGUISHES A REPUBLICAN READING OF CONSTITUENT POWER AS IMMANENT TO THE JURIDICAL ORDER FROM SCHMITT'S ATTEMPT TO JOIN CONSTITUENT POWER WITH DICTATORSHIP.
299	THIS REVIEW CONSIDERS COMPETING MODELS OF EMERGENCY LEGAL REGULATION IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. DRAWING ON RESEARCH IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY, IT CRITICIZES RECENT DEBATES ABOUT EMERGENCY POWERS AMONG LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS FOR IGNORING THE INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS OF MODEM EXECUTIVE POWER, ESPECIALLY IN PRESIDENTIAL REGIMES. CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIVISTS (E.G., HARVEY MANSFIELD, MICHAEL STOKES PAULSEN, JOHN YOO), DEFENDERS OF THE EXTRALEGAL MODEL OF EMERGENCY ACTION (OREN GROSS, MARK TUSHNET), AND COMMON LAWYERS (DAVID COLE, DAVID DYZENHAUS) ARE CRITICIZED FOR FAILING TO CONSIDER THE PATHOLOGIES LIKELY GENERATED BY THEIR PROPOSALS IN AN INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THE EXECUTIVE POSSESSES INCENTIVES FOR DECLARING, PERPETUATING, AND EXPLOITING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. ONLY A LEGAL FORMALIST PERSPECTIVE ON EMERGENCY GOVERNMENT (E.G., BRUCE ACKERMAN) PAYS SUFFICIENT ATTENTION TO THE INSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS OF THE CONTEMPORARY EXECUTIVE.
300	OVER THE LAST YEARS LATIN AMERICA HAS EXPERIENCED AS NEVER BEFORE THE EXPANSION OF VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO MANY STUDIES, THIS PHENOMENON IS CLOSELY LINKED TO INEQUALITY AND MANIFESTS ITSELF IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THIS MEANS THAT VIOLENCE IN LATIN AMERICA DOES NOT HAVE A UNIQUE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR. THE GOAL OF THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION IS TO SEEK A DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM AND TO EXPLORE WHAT MIGHT BE THE CAUSES OF INSECURITY IN THE REGION BASED ON INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VARIABLES AND INDICATORS. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS CONSIDERED THAT FACTORS SUCH AS INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS, CORRUPTION, INEQUALITY AND SOCIAL CAPITAL INFLUENCE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, OR AT LEAST IN DIFFERENT DEGREES, WHEN EXPLAINING WHY THE LATIN AMERICAN SUB-CONTINENT IS SUCH A VIOLENT REGION WHILE BEING A TERRITORY IN PEACE.
301	DEMOCRACY IS THE DEFINING TERM OF THE HUMAN SOCIETY AT THE BEINNING OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM. ITS VICTORY OVER DIFFERENT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEMS OF THE XXTH CENTURY PUT IT IN AN UNGRATEFUL AND PARADOXICAL SITUATION IN THE SAME TIME. IT IS A PARADOXICAL SITUATION BECAUSE ITS SUCCESS BROUGHT TO IT, IN THE SAME TIME, A MAJOR DILUTION OF ITS 'STRONG' MEANINGS. IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION BECAUSE THE SAME SUCCESS MADE IT BE THE ONLY POLITICAL GOAL AT THE LEVEL OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN SOCIETY, EVERY LOCAL FAILURE AFFECTING ITS INTEGRATOR MESSAGE. BECAUSE OF THIS, ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT DEMOCRACY MUST START FROM THE MOMENT WHEN WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY MEANS AND WE MANAGE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECT FROM IT. THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS ARE MORE VALID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ROMANIAN DEMOCRACY. IN THE LAST DECADES, IT HAD A SINUOUS WAY AND THIS SINUOSITY DERIVES NOT ONLY FROM THE LACK OF STRUCTURAL BASIS OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM IN ROMANIA, BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY THE RESULT OF LACK OF VIABLE MECHANISMS OF CONTROLLING THE POLITICAL POWER BY CITIZENS. THIS STUDY TRIES TO IDENTIFY, IN A CLASSICAL LIBERAL TRADITION, SOME MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN ROMANIA.
302	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT DEMOCRACY IN VENEZUELA RECORDED IN THE LAST DECADE, AND SPECIFICALLY THE SUSTAINED PROCESS OF INSTITUTIONAL DECAY, DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL, UNDERSTANDING THE LATTER AS A BREACH OF THE CONSTITUTION AS SUPREME LAW, REAL ABSENCE OF DIVISION OF PUBLIC AND VIOLATION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT OCCUR IN A CONTEXT OF PRECARIOUSNESS OF INSTITUTIONS AND DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES OF THE FABRIC, PARALLEL TO A PERSONALIZATION OF POLITICS WITH CUTTING TRENDS MESSIANIC AND AUTHORITARIAN.
303	ACEMOGLU AND ASSOCIATES ARGUE THAT RESISTANCE TO DEMOCRATISATION WILL BE STRONGER WHERE INEQUALITY IS HIGH. PIKETTY SHOWS THAT SHIFTS AT THE UPPER END OF THE DISTRIBUTION MAY BE HISTORICALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN OVERALL MEASURES OF INEQUALITY. IN THAILAND, THE HIGH LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY HAS EASED SLIGHTLY SINCE 2000, BUT THERE IS A "1% PROBLEM" AS PEAK INCOMES ARE GROWING FASTER THAN THE AVERAGE. NEWLY AVAILABLE DATA SHOW THAT INEQUALITY OF WEALTH IS VERY HIGH. AT THE TOP OF THE WEALTH PYRAMID, FAMILY HOLDINGS OF COMMERCIAL CAPITAL ARE GROWING. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF TOP ENTREPRENEURS HAVE EMERGED WITHIN THE PAST GENERATION. A SECOND TIER OF THE WEALTH ELITE HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST GENERATION FROM RISING PROPERTY VALUES, FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AND PROFESSIONAL INCOMES. ALTHOUGH THEIR INDIVIDUAL WEALTH IS MUCH LESS THAN THE CORPORATE ELITE, THEIR NUMBERS ARE MUCH GREATER. THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROSPERING "1%" AND THE EMERGENCE OF THE SECOND-TIER WEALTHY MAY CORROBORATE ACEMOGLU'S PROPOSITION, BUT THERE ARE TENSIONS WITHIN THE WEALTH ELITE WHICH MAY FAVOUR DEMOCRACY.
304	IN FRONT OF A POSTMODERN CONTEXT, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO RETURN TO FORMAL CONCEPT OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF RIGHT, IN ORDER TO PROMOTE A PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION ON THE JUSTIFYING ASSUMPTIONS OF THIS TYPE OF POLITICAL REGIME. TO REMAIN CRITICALLY ANALYZED THE ARGUMENTS OF THAT IDEOLOGICAL LEGAL- POLITICAL SKETCH, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE INFLUENCE OF KANT'S THOUGHT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC EVALUATIVE PROMOTION.
305	AS IT HAS HAPPENED IN SOME OTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA, VENEZUELA HAS EXPERIENCED A DELICATE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS OVER THE LAST DECADES. IN THIS PAPER, THERE ARE ANALYZED ASPECTS RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, THE JUDICIARY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN VENEZUELA. THIS PAPER PRETENDS TO COME UP WITH SOME LESSONS LEARNT AS WELL AS SOME CHALLENGES WICH ARE INTODUCED TO BY THIS POLITICAL EVOLUTION IN VENEZUELA, MAINLY TOUGHT THE EXAMINATION OF THE 2007 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROJECT.
306	WHILE POPULIST RULE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY PREVALENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, MUCH OF OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ITS IMPLICATIONS REMAINS ANECDOTAL AND CONTRADICTORY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CONDUCT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LARGE-N CROSS-NATIONAL TEST OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF POPULIST RULE TO DATE. USING DATA ON 19 LATIN AMERICAN STATES, WE FIND THAT POPULISM'S IMPLICATIONS ARE MOSTLY NEGATIVE: (1) POPULIST REGIMES TEND TO ERODE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY; (2) PARTICIPATION RATES ARE NOT HIGHER UNDER POPULIST GOVERNMENTS OR FOR POPULIST CAMPAIGNERS; AND (3) POPULIST RULE, EVEN UNDER LEFT-WING POPULISTS, IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MORE REDISTRIBUTION THAN NON-POPULIST DEMOCRATIC RULE. WE PERFORM INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATIONS AND A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY OF POPULISM.
307	THE ENVIRONMENTAL SECTOR IS AN INTERESTING REALM IN CHINESE POLITICS TO OBSERVE FACTORS SUCH AS THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NEW MEDIA ACTIVISM IN BOTTOM-UP COMMUNICATION AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, ESPECIALLY DURING THE 40 YEARS OF REFORM AND OPENING UP. TOP-DOWN EFFORTS TO CURB ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE PRIMARILY TO ADDRESS INCREASING PUBIC DISCOMFORT DUE TO POLLUTION AND RELATED PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY VISIBLE IN CHINA DESPITE THEIR APPLICATION OF STABILITY MAINTENANCE MECHANISMS SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL POLICE. IT IS THEREFORE NOTEWORTHY TO DEEPLY ANALYSE THE ACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE INCREASING SCALE OF MOVEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF NEW MEDIA ACTIVISM (OCCURRING DUE TO THE PUBLIC'S INTERACTIONS THROUGH WECHAT, WEIBO, QQ, ETC.) IN SHAPING THE TRAJECTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENTS IN CHINA. HOW ARE THESE AVENUES SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM POLICY MAKING APPARATUS? IS THE GOVERNMENT WILLING TO INCORPORATE THE INTERESTS DEVELOPED IN THESE CHANNELS TO POLICY MAKING REALMS? HOW THESE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES ARE INFLUENCING THE STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA IN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. THE STUDY EMPLOYS AGENCY-STRUCTURE FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NEW MEDIA ACTIVISM AND THE SINGLE PARTY RULING POLITICAL STRUCTURE WITH THE SUPPORT FIELDWORK DATA FROM CHINA. THE STUDY EXAMINES POLICY DOCUMENTS, OFFICIAL DECLARATIONS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. PUBLIC ATTITUDE TOWARDS NEW MEDIA ACTIVISM, AND SO ON, IN ORDER TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING ON THE POLITICS OF ECOLOGY IN THE PRC.
308	THE STRATEGIC POSITION NIGERIA OCCUPIES IN THE WEST AFRICA SUB-REGION AND IN AFRICA AT LARGE IS LARGELY REFLECTED IN THE SIZE OF ITS POPULATION; ITS POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND ECONOMIC POTENTIALS. FOR THESE REASONS, PEACE AND STABILITY IN NIGERIA, NATURALLY REFLECTS IN AFRICA, PARTICULARLY, IN WEST AFRICA. SINCE THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE BEGAN IN 1999, NIGERIANS HAVE LOOKED TOWARDS EACH GENERAL ELECTION WITH TREPIDATION DUE TO THE UNHEALTHY SIGNALS EMERGING FROM POLITICAL ACTIVITIES SUPERVISED BY THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (INEC). WITH EACH GENERAL ELECTION - 1999, 2003 AND 2007 - THE POLITY IS HIGHLY HEATED UP BY THREATS OF VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION. WORDS LIKE THE "COUNTRY WILL BURN IF...," "THE MASSES OF THIS COUNTRY WILL REVOLT IF...." INEC, BEING THE 'IF' FACTOR. INEC HAS SINCE 1999, PROGRESSIVELY SHOWN ITSELF AS A BODY INCAPABLE OF ABIDING BY LAW AND OR UPHOLDING FAIRNESS AND NON-PARTISANSHIP IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES. OPPOSITION POLITICIANS AND INDEED THE VOTERS CONCLUDE EVEN BEFORE ELECTIONS ARE HELD THAT INEC WOULD MANIPULATE THE VOTES IN FAVOUR OF ITS PREFERRED POLITICAL PARTY, AND THUS BEGIN TO LOOK FOR WAYS AND MEANS - INCLUDING VIOLENT PROTESTS - OF DEFENDING THEIR VOTES. THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE FAILURES OF INEC, NOT FROM THE AUTHORS' SUBJECTIVE PERSPECTIVE, BUT FROM FACTS AND FIGURES GATHERED FROM DECIDED CASES AND THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THOSE CASES. THE WORK DISCUSSES THESE FAILURES; IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE WEAKNESSES OF INEC AS WELL AS PROPOSED SOLUTIONS.
309	COSTA GAVRAS SHOT MISSING IN 1982, A FILM IN WHICH HE CRITICIZES US POLICIES IN LATIN AMERICA THROUGH CHARLES HORMAN'S CASE, AN EXAMPLE OF THE PHENOMENON OF ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES OF PERSONS, WHICH CONSTITUTES AN INTERNATIONAL CRIME. THE MOVIE FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE SENSE OF IHERING'S EXPRESSION "THE STRUGGLE FOR LAW".
310	SCHOLARS WHO EXAMINE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OFFER VARIOUS THEORIES REGARDING ITS DEVELOPMENT. SOME ARGUE THAT IT SERVES AS A TYPE OF INSURANCE FOR REGIMES WHO BELIEVE THEIR MAJORITY STATUS IS IN JEOPARDY. OTHER SCHOLARS ARGUE THAT INSURANCE THEORY DOES NOT OFFER AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION UNTIL STATES DEMOCRATIZE. WE ARGUE THAT PART OF THE EXPLANATION FOR THESE MIXED RESULTS INVOLVES THE INADEQUACY OF INSURANCE THEORY AS A COMPLETE EXPLANATION. OUR PAPER DEVELOPS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL THEORY THAT FOCUSES ON THE INTERPLAY OF CONSTRAINTS ON RULING ELITES DERIVED FROM LEVELS OF POLITICAL COMPETITION WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT, THE POTENTIAL FOR SOCIAL COMPETITION WITHIN THE STATE, AND REGIME TYPE. WE TEST OUR ARGUMENT USING A DATASET OF APPROXIMATELY 145 COUNTRIES OVER FORTY YEARS, AND OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS RELATED TO THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE ENCOUNTERED BY THE EXECUTIVE. ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION IN THE STATE, POLITICAL COMPETITION, AND REGIME TYPE EACH HAS A CONDITIONAL EFFECT ON THE OBSERVATION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
311	USING DATA ON 75 COUNTRIES FOR SIX YEARS IN THE PERIOD 1995-2003, THIS PAPER ANALYZES EMPIRICALLY WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LABOR MARKET. ACCORDING TO THE REGRESSION RESULTS, A LEGAL SYSTEM CHARACTERIZED BY A DEPENDENT JUDICIARY, BIASED COURTS, A LACK OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND A LACK OF INTEGRITY INCREASES UNEMPLOYMENT AND LOWERS THE EMPLOYMENT LEVEL. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT SEEMS TO BE SUBSTANTIAL, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE.
312	SUBJECT AND SCOPE: THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY IS A PILLAR OF DEMOCRATIC STATES, AS IS COLOMBIA. THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION ISSUED IN 1991 GIVES A NEW CONNOTATION TO THIS PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS CHOSEN TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLIED WITH IN COLOMBIA. THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS DEALT WITH THE SUBJECT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, WHICH GIVE THE GUIDELINE TO ANALYZE THE SCOPE AND REPERCUSSION THAT THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE HAS IN LABOR MATTERS, ON WHICH THE STABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEPENDS IN PART. CHARACTERISTICS: THE DOCUMENT WILL ALLOW TO STUDY THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL PROVISIONS ON THE SUBJECT, AS WELL AS THE POSITION OF THE JURISPRUDENCE AND DOCTRINE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY IN LABOR RELATIONS IN THE COUNTRY. IT IS VITAL TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, AND AMONG THEM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY, ARE A GUARANTEE FOR THE CITIZEN PARTICIPANT OF THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, WHERE THE PRIMORDIAL THING IS THE RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY AND THE HUMAN PERSON; THEREFORE, SOMETHING VITAL FOR HIM/HER AS WORK IS PROTECTED. FINDINGS: EQUALITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN ALMOST ALL JURISDICTIONS OF THE WORLD; THEREFORE, REVIEWING ITS LEGAL ROOTS AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION SINCE THE 1991 CHARTER IS PREPONDERANT IN THIS STUDY. IT IS TRANSCENDENTAL THAT EQUALITY EXISTS IN LABOR RELATIONS, BECAUSE IF IT DOES NOT EXIST, INEQUITABLE RELATIONS WILL RESULT.
313	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES PART OF THE MOST RECENT INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTION ON LAW & DEVELOPMENT BASED UPON THREE RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOKS: TWO COLLECTIONS OF ESSAYS ORGANIZED BY THOMAS CAROTHERS AND BY DAVID M. TRUBEK AND ALVARO SANTOS, AND A MONOGRAPH BY KENNETH DAM. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THERE IS ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHETHER LAW IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC OUTCOMES IN DEVELOPING SOCIETIES GIVEN THE EXISTENCE OF INFORMAL METHODS OF SOCIAL CONTROL; WHETHER THERE ARE INSURMOUNTABLE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL OR CULTURE OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE LEGAL REFORM; AS WELL AS, ASSUMING EFFECTIVE LEGAL REFORM IS FEASIBLE, WHAT TYPES OF REFORMS ARE CONDUCIVE TO DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT TYPES OF ACTORS OUGHT TO IMPLEMENT THEM. WE ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LEGAL REFORMS UPON DEVELOPMENT, THE RELEVANT EMPIRICAL LITERATURE IS INCONCLUSIVE ON MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND COUNSELS CAUTION ABOUT THE WISDOM OF CONTINUING TO INVEST SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES IN PROMOTING LEGAL REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITHOUT FURTHER RESEARCH THAT CLARIFIES THESE ISSUES.D
314	CONSTITUTION AS THE HIGHEST LEGAL AND POLITICAL DOCUMENT IN ANY POLITICAL COMMUNITY IS THE REGULATOR OF ALL MATTERS AND AFFAIRS AND SPECIFIES MODERATE RELATIONS BETWEEN AUTHORITIES. COMMITMENT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT LAW CLOSES THE DOORS AND POSSIBILITIES OF DICTATORSHIP AND GUARANTEES HUMAN DIGNITY AND INDIVIDUALS' SANCTITY AND FREEDOM AND FACILITATES ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THE MAJORITY OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE NOT ABSOLUTE; EVEN THERE IS NO RELATION BETWEEN FUNDAMENTALITY OF RIGHTS AND ITS ABSOLUTENESS. IN GENERAL VIEW, WE CAN SPECIFY THAT IN THE CONSTITUTION OF ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, FREEDOM HAS NEVER BECOME AN ABSOLUTE AND NON-DISCIPLINED ISSUE; BUT THE LEGISLATOR HAS DECREED SOME OF ITS RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE OBJECTIVES AND IDEALS OF HUMANITY AND BY STUDYING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THEREBY IT HAS PROVIDED NECESSARY INTERNAL COHESION AND COORDINATION AMONG ITS COMPONENTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES LIMITATION OF INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND ITS PRINCIPLES IN THE CONSTITUTION OF IRAN.
315	THE CENTRAL THEME IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF HANS KELSEN, PUBLISHED IN GERMAN IN 2006, AND EDITED IN SPANISH BY THE UNIVERSIDAD EXTERNADO DE COLOMBIA THIS YEAR, IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL OF AUSTRIA IN 1920 AND THE PROCESS THAT LED TO ITS DISSOLUTION FOR POLITICAL REASONS. IT IS EVIDENT THAT DICTATORIAL REGIMES OR AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS CANNOT COEXIST WITH TRUE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL.
316	THIS ARTICLE TRY TO MAKE A SCHEMATIC PRESENTATION OF CONCEPTS LIKE BIOPOLITICS, DISCIPLINARY POWER, CONTROL SOCIETY, DISCIPLINARY SOCIETY AND OTHERS WHICH ARE RELATED SINCE ITS ORIGINAL SOURCE; THE WORK ON TECHNOLOGIES OF POWER BY THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER MICHEL FOUCAULT, SHOWING HOW THESE ARE INSEPARABLE IN HIS WORK OF THE ILLEGALISMS TO WHICH IT GOES DIRECTED AND OF THE TYPE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY ARE INSERTED. BESIDES THIS ARTICLE WANTS TO RESCUE A POWER TECHNOLOGY LESS REFERENCED, THE SEMIOTECHNIQUE, AND DEMONSTRATES HOW IT IS USEFUL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF POWER IN A SPECIFIC CASE: THE SECURITY POLICY AND CITIZEN COEXISTENCE WHICH REACTIVE THIS EXERCISE OF POWER MODE, FRAMING IN THE PRACTICES MASS SURVEILLANCE AND SPACES CONTROL THAT EXTENDED FOR CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY.
317	THE ESSAY DEALS WITH RALF DAHRENDORF'S REFLECTIONS ON THE CRISIS OF CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACY. AFTER DESCRIBING HIS PROCEDURALIST, REALIST AND ELITIST CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY, THE ARTICLE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION DAHRENDORF'S ANALYSIS OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS THAT ARE ENTAILING << SERIOUS AND DEEP TROUBLES >> FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF DEMOCRACY. TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS BASED ON THE NATION- STATE HAVE LOST THEIR POLITICAL RELEVANCE. ACCORDING TO DAHRENDORF'S LIBERAL POINT OF VIEW, WESTERN DEMOCRACIES ARE NOW FACING AUTHORITARIAN RISKS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STRONG CHECKS AND BALANCES AND CITIZENS' APATHY. THE ESSAY ENDS WITH THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE REMEDIES DAHRENDORF CONSIDERS AS NECESSARY TO RESTORE PEOPLE'S CONTROL OVER POLITICAL POWER.

318	THE CONSTITUTIONALISM'S SUCCESS AS A TOOL TO UNDERSTAND AND ORGANISE OUR POLITICAL REALITIES FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES UNIVERSALLY RECOGNISED AS LEGITIMATE HAS LED US TO APPLY IT OVER THE NEW ARISING SPACES BEYOND THE NATION-STATE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE BRIEFLY THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION AS WELL AS TO RAISE CURRENT DEBATES SUCH AS THE PROSPECT OF AN EFFECTIVE REALIZATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AT A GLOBAL SCALE; THE OBSTACLES TO CONSTITUTIONALISE REGIONAL SPACES (ESPECIALLY THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A PARADIGMATIC AND ADVANCED EXAMPLE); THE SITUATION OF THE DEMOCRACY; AND THE RISKS FOR THE OWN CONSTITUTIONALISM AS A THEORETICAL CONCEPT.
319	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RATIONALE OF ADEIA (IMMUNITY) IN THE FIFTH-CENTURY ATHENIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. IT ARGUES THAT ADEIA WAS DESIGNED TO GRANT A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE EFFECT OF A LAW IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR ANY PERMANENT LEGAL CHANGE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ORIGIN OF ADEIA AND THE RELEVANT IDEOLOGY UNDERPINNING THE LEGAL PROCEDURE. IT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEGAL PROCEDURE AND ANALYSES THE EXTENSIVE USE OF ADEIA FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PROFANATION OF THE MYSTERIES AND THE MUTILATION OF THE HERMS IN 415 BC. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE USE OF ADEIA FOR PUBLIC INVESTIGATION AND EMERGENCY POWERS IN CLASSICAL ATHENS.
320	DISPUTE RESOLUTION INSTITUTIONS FACILITATE AGREEMENTS AND PRESERVE THE PEACE WHENEVER PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPERFECT. IN WEAK STATES, STRENGTHENING FORMAL INSTITUTIONS CAN TAKE DECADES, AND SO STATE AND AID INTERVENTIONS ALSO TRY TO SHAPE INFORMAL PRACTICES AND NORMS GOVERNING DISPUTES. THEIR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE BARGAINING AND COMMITMENT, THUS LIMITING DISPUTES AND VIOLENCE. MASS EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS THAT PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) ARE COMMON EXAMPLES OF THESE INTERVENTIONS. WE STUDIED THE SHORT-TERM IMPACTS OF ONE SUCH CAMPAIGN IN LIBERIA, WHERE PROPERTY DISPUTES ARE ENDEMIC. RESIDENTS OF 86 OF 246 TOWNS RANDOMLY RECEIVED TRAINING IN ADR PRACTICES AND NORMS; THIS TRAINING REACHED 15% OF ADULTS. ONE YEAR LATER, TREATED TOWNS HAD HIGHER RESOLUTION OF LAND DISPUTES AND LOWER VIOLENCE. IMPACTS SPILLED OVER TO UNTRAINED RESIDENTS. WE ALSO SAW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: MORE EXTRAJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT AND (WEAKLY) MORE NONVIOLENT DISAGREEMENTS. RESULTS IMPLY THAT MASS EDUCATION CAN CHANGE HIGH-STAKES BEHAVIORS, AND IMPROVING INFORMAL BARGAINING AND ENFORCEMENT BEHAVIOR CAN PROMOTE ORDER IN WEAK STATES.
321	JUDICIAL CONTROL OVER PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAS SPRUNG FROM THE CONCEPT OF DIVISION OF POWERS AND FROM THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE WISH TO ENFORCE THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE TERRITORIES THAT WERE LATER PART OF YUGOSLAVIA, ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE BEGAN TO DEVELOP IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THERE EXISTED DIFFERENT LEGAL REGULATION AND ORGANISATIONAL SOLUTIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE DUE TO THE THEN STATE AND CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS INTERRUPTED ONLY BETWEEN 1945 AND 1952. AFTER THE NEW STATES WERE CREATED IN THE FORMER YUGOSLAV TERRITORY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 1990S, JUDICIAL CONTROL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING ON THREE BASES: COMMON TRADITION, THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS OF EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND PARTICULARITIES OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. THE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN FLUCTUATING BETWEEN YUGOSLAV TRADITION AND EUROPEAN MODERNISATION. IT IS ORIENTED TOWARDS A WIDER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE COURT PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND TOWARDS STRICTER JUDICIAL CONTROL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE MAIN CHALLENGES ARE: ESTABLISHMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE COURT(S); INTRODUCTION OF ORAL CONTRADICTORY HEARING; INTRODUCTION OF SECOND INSTANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM; WORK OVERLOAD IN ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS; RELATION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS; NECESSARY IMPROVEMENTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATION OF JUDGES; ETC.
322	DURING THE FRANCO REGIME THERE WERE ISSUED SEVERAL LEGAL TEXTS, SUCH AS THE LABOUR CHARTER LAW (1938) AND THE CHARTER OF RIGHTS LAW (1945), WHICH RECOGNIZED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOR SPANIARDS. THE RIGHTS GRANTED INCLUDED, AMONG OTHERS, THE RIGHT TO WORK AND THE RIGHT TO SERVE THE COUNTRY IN PUBLIC AREAS. THROUGH AN HISTORICAL REVIEW, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONCLUDE ABOUT THREE IMPORTANT ISSUES: THE IDEOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT UNDERPINNED THE CIVIL RIGHTS' CONCEPTIONS DURING THE FRANCO REGIME; THE WAY HOW RIGHTS RECOGNITION WAS JUSTIFIED WITHIN AN AUTOCRACY, THAT HAD ITSELF BEEN DECLARED ANTAGONISTIC TO MODERN DOCTRINES WHICH HISTORICALLY HAD VINDICATE HUMAN RIGHTS (I.E., CONSTITUTIONALISM, POLITICAL LIBERALISM OR SOCIAL DEMOCRACY); AND THE POLICY AND LEGAL SCOPE APPLIED TO RECOGNIZE THOSE RIGHTS.
323	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE OF COUNSEL BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR TASKS UNDER THE STATUTE OF THE COURT AND THE LEGAL VALUE OF THEIR PLEADINGS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. PLEADINGS OF COUNSEL CONSTITUTE STATE PRACTICE FOR THE FORMATION OF CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW AND TREATY INTERPRETATION, AND THEY ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LITIGATING STATE UNDER THE LAW ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY. ACCORDINGLY, IN PRINCIPLE, COUNSEL PRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE LITIGATING STATE, WHICH IN PRACTICE APPROVES IN ADVANCE THE PLEADINGS. THIS CONSIDERATION IS RELEVANT IN DISCUSSING THE ROLE OF COUNSEL ASSISTING STATES IN POLITICALLY SENSITIVE CASES, WHERE THERE IS NO NECESSARY CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE VIEWS OF THE STATES AND THOSE OF THEIR COUNSEL. ESPECIALLY WHEN LESS POWERFUL STATES ARE PARTIES TO THE RELEVANT DISPUTES, THE AVAILABILITY OF COMPETENT COUNSEL IN POLITICALLY SENSITIVE CASES SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED SINCE IT ADVANCES THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL FUNCTION.
324	SINCE 2010 THE EU HAS BEEN IN AN 'EMERGENCY' SITUATION DUE TO THE EURO CRISIS, WHERE THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT BY THE EU INSTITUTIONS, NOTABLY THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY OUT OF STEP WITH THE EU TREATIES AND THE NATURAL MEANING OF THE PROVISIONS DEFINING THE MANDATE OF THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE EU'S ECONOMIC POLICY POWERS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO THE EURO CRISIS. THE DISCUSSION WILL FOCUS ON THE PRINGLE DECISION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU AND THE ESM JUDGMENT OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (HEREAFTER 'FCC'), IN WHICH BOTH COURTS HAD TO CONSIDER THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM (HEREAFTER 'ESM') WITH THE EU TREATIES AND, IN THE CASE OF THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, ALSO WITH THE GERMAN CONSTITUTION KNOWN AS THE GRUNDGESETZ. FURTHER BUT LESS DETAILED CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN TO OTHER DECISIONS HANDED DOWN BY BOTH COURTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EURO CRISIS SINCE 2011. IN RELATION TO THE PRINGLE DECISION, THE AUTHOR WILL SUMMARIZE THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE DECISION AND ANALYSE THE COURT'S LEGAL ARGUMENTATION TO JUSTIFY ITS CONCLUSIONS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COURT'S GENERAL APPROACH EXHIBITS FEATURES WHICH AFFORD THE COURT GREAT FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE UNDERHAND ACCOUNT OF EXTRA-LEGAL FACTORS OF JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING, NOTABLY POLITICAL GOALS AND INSTITUTIONAL SELF-INTEREST. IN PRINGLE, HOWEVER, THE COURT EXPLOITS THE VAGUENESS AND NORM UNCERTAINTY IN ITS GENERAL APPROACH TO THE MAXIMUM, TO A POINT WHERE LEGAL REASONING NO LONGER IMPOSES ANY MEANINGFUL CONSTRAINTS ON JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. THE AUTHOR FURTHER SHOWS THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE'S PRAGMATIC AND POLITICALLY COMPLIANT RESPONSE TO THE EURO CRISIS IS MIRRORED BY THE APPROACH OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (HEREAFTER 'FCC') WHICH, IN ITS JUDGMENTS ON THE LEGALITY OF THE GREEK FINANCIAL AID MEASURES, THE EUROZONE'S TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT RESCUE FUNDS, AND THE ECB'S SO-CALLED OUTRIGHT MONETARY TRANSACTIONS ('OMT') UNLIMITED BONDS BUYS PROGRAMME EFFECTIVELY ABANDONED MOST CENTRAL TENETS OF ITS LONG-ESTABLISHED AND WELL-CONSIDERED CASE LAW ON THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EU AND NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE EU'S SUPRA-NATIONAL AUTHORITY CONFINED BY THE EU TREATIES.
325	DOES AN INFORMAL INSTITUTION GRANT POLICE WIDE LATITUDE TO USE LETHAL FORCE IN ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL? EVIDENCE FROM EXTENSIVE FIELDWORK AND A SAMPLE OF POLICE HOMICIDE PROSECUTIONS IN BUENOS AIRES AND SAO PAULO INDICATE THAT AN INFORMAL INSTITUTION IS AT WORK IN CASES INVOLVING THE KILLING OF A VICTIM PERCEIVED AS A VIOLENT CRIMINAL BUT NOT IN MORE ROUTINE CASES OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. IN THE LATTER CASES, THE PROBLEM IS MORE PROPERLY CHARACTERIZED AS A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM TO GATHER THE REQUISITE INFORMATION TO SUPPORT A PROSECUTION.
326	IN THE GLOBAL ARENA, THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BRICS COUNTRIES - BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND SOUTH AFRICA - COVERS AROUND 42% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DYNAMIC EMERGING ECONOMIES. INITIALLY, THE BRICS COOPERATION WAS SUGGESTED AS AN IDEA, AND IT WAS LATER WELCOMED AS A NEW ADDITION TO THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE DEBATE ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE BRICS COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY HELD TEN CONSECUTIVE SUMMITS OF HEADS OF STATE PLUS A LARGE NUMBER OF MEETINGS AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL. THE COOPERATION DESCRIBES ITSELF AS A "COOPERATION AND DIALOGUE" PLATFORM, BUT IT HAS NONETHELESS SIGNED A NUMBER OF BINDING TREATIES AND, NOTABLY, ESTABLISHED THE NEW DEVELOPMENT BANK (NOB) AS A PERMANENT INSTITUTION HEADQUARTERED IN SHANGHAI (CHINA). THE COOPERATION HAS ALSO MET WITH RESISTANCE, CRITICISM AND PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE OVERALL COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD. THE DIVERSITY AND REMOTE LOCATIONS OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES HAVE ALSO BEEN THOUGHT OF AS AN OBSTACLE TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL COOPERATION AND THEIR ABILITY TO PLAY AN ACTIVE PART IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. THE MAIN CHALLENGE THUS LIES IN THEIR ABILITY TO OVERCOME THEIR DIFFERENCES AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN DESIGNING THE FUTURE GLOBAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC WORLD ORDER. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE DEBATE, THE PRESENT PAPER THEREFORE ASKS WHETHER THE BRICS COOPERATION CONSTITUTES A NOVEL MODEL OF REGIONALISM WITH MULTILATERAL ASPIRATIONS, AND WHAT ROLE LAW AND, NOTABLY, THE "RULE OF LAW" CAN PLAY IN THIS IMPORTANT TASK. THE PAPER INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BRICS COOPERATION NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED IN LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL TERMS, AND POSSIBLY TO PROCEED FROM COOPERATION VIA CONSOLIDATION TO THE CODIFICATION OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT SOURCES OF GLOBAL LAW.
327	THE HISTORICAL STAGE OF FORMATION AND EVOLUTION OF DOMESTIC STATE AND LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE FIELD OF SAFETY AND A LAW AND ORDER ON THE RAILROADS OF THE SOVIET STATE (INCLUDING PASSING THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF BELARUS) IN RELATION TO A CONCRETE HISTORICAL POLITICAL SITUATION IS ANALYZED. IN ARTICLE THE STANDARD LEGAL AND DEPARTMENTAL ACTS GOVERNING THE PUBLIC RELATIONS, DEVELOPING IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OF RAILWAY TRANSPORT, LEGAL STATUS OF THE STATE BODIES DEALING WITH ISSUES OF SAFETY AND A LAW AND ORDER ON THE RAILROADS ARE INVESTIGATED; THE MOST WIDESPREAD THREATS TO INTERESTS OF THE STATE, SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS SPHERE OF THE RELATIONS WHICH ARE ACTUAL ALSO THE PRESENT ARE ALLOCATED.
328	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN LAW, POLITICS, AND THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT IN AFRICA. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER AFRICAN DEMOCRACIES ENJOY RELATIVELY BETTER GOVERNMENT QUALITY (GQ) COMPARED TO THEIR COUNTERPARTS WITH MORE AUTOCRATIC INCLINATIONS. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES AND FIXED EFFECTS WITH DATA FROM 38 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1994-2010. POLITICAL REGIMES OF DEMOCRACY, POLITY, AND AUTOCRACY ARE INSTRUMENTED WITH INCOME LEVELS, LEGAL ORIGINS, RELIGIOUS DOMINATIONS, AND PRESS FREEDOM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GQ DYNAMICS OF CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATION QUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. FINDINGS SHOW THAT DEMOCRACY HAS AN EDGE OVER AUTOCRACY WHILE THE LATTER AND POLITY OVERLAP. AS A POLICY IMPLICATION, DEMOCRACY ONCE INITIATED SHOULD BE ACCELERATED TO EDGE THE APPEALS OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES.
329	INDIA SHOULD NEGOTIATE ROBUST DISPUTE SETTLEMENT CHAPTERS IN ITS FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (FTAS). THROUGH APPROPRIATE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THOSE CHAPTERS, INDIA SHOULD PURSUE THREE GOALS, NAMELY, THE SWIFT, JUST RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES, DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMON LAW ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE, AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION. INDIA'S PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS WILL HELP IT EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION, AND COUNTER THE PROSPECT OF AN AUTHORITARIAN CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) ESSENTIALLY DICTATING HOW TRADE AND INVESTMENT DISPUTES ARE TO BE RESOLVED. HOWEVER, FOR INDIA TO PURSUE SUCH NEGOTIATIONS, IT MUST FIRST RESOLVE ITS BIPOLAR APPROACH TO TRADE POLICY, BETWEEN NEHRUVIAN SOCIALISM AND MARKET-ORIENTED REFORMISM, WHICH HAS PARALYSED IT FROM PURSUING AN AGGRESSIVE FTA AGENDA AMIDST UNDERSTANDABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEXUS AMONG TRADE, GROWTH, AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION. THAT MEANS IT WILL HAVE TO DE-EMPHASIZE ITS CURRENT - AND QUIXOTIC - POLICY OF ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT (SELF-RELIANT INDIA).
330	THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (ECJ) IS OF CRUCIAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE PROCESS OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION BASED ON THE VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY TAKING PLACE IN THE EU. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN POLAND THAT BEGAN IN THE END OF 2015 HAS CHALLENGED THE SYSTEMIC POSITION OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. IT RESULTED IN A NEW MODEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION, AND IN THIS NEW MODEL THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, STRIPPED OF ITS COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN POWER, CANNOT BE PERCEIVED AS THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE POSTULATES THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PRESENT CASE LAW OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN EUROPEAN MATTERS IS MADE THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE PRE-2016 (I.E. BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS). BASED ON THAT ASSUMPTION, THE CURRENT REVERSAL IN THE CASE LAW OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CONCERNING THE ECJ IS ANALYSED AND ASSESSED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN POLAND IS THE DEPARTURE FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, WHICH ARE FOUNDATIONAL-IN LIGHT OF THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE INTEGRATION PROCESS-FOR THE AXIOLOGICAL IDENTITY OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES. THIS ARTICLE ALSO SHOWS HOW THE PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS DEVELOPED IN THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE PRE-2016 COULD HAVE SERVED TO AVOID THE CURRENT CONFLICT WITH THE ECJ, AND HOW THOSE NOTIONS ARE MISUSED IN THE CURRENT JURISPRUDENCE OF THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT.
331	LOOKING AT EGYPT BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE ARAB SPRING, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE INTERSECTION OF CHRISTIAN COPTS, THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, THE EGYPTIAN ARMY, MODERATE MUSLIMS AND SECULAR GROUPS. IN TURN, IT EXAMINES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES TOWARD EGYPT. IT DISCLOSES THE SURPRISING FINDING THAT THE ONLY CONSISTENT ASPECT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY TOWARD EGYPT HAS BEEN OUTREACH TO AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD. AT NO TIME BEFORE OR AFTER THE BROTHERHOOD'S ASCENT TO PROMINENCE IN EGYPTIAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY DID THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE SUPPORT OF THE BROTHERHOOD CONDITIONAL. AT NO TIME DID IT USE US LEVERAGE - GIVEN THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AND MILITARY AID EGYPT WAS DEPENDING ON, AND GIVEN THE NEW EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT'S DESIRE FOR PRESTIGE IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY-TO PRESSURE THE MORSI GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND THE IMPARTIAL RULE OF LAW. ARGUING THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY AT ITS BEST IS ROOTED IN DEMOCRATIC IDEALS, THIS PAPER ASKS WHETHER THE UNITED STATES, WHILE RESPECTING THAT EGYPTIANS MUST CHOOSE THEIR LEADERS AND THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM, COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO ENCOURAGE A POSITIVE STRATEGIC, MORAL AND POLITICAL OUTCOME.
332	UNTIL THE FIRST HALF OF THE XX CENTURY THE CODIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE AND ACTIVISM OF PRIVATE AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION WITH RESULTS NOT FAVORABLE TO THE INTERESTS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SUCH SITUATION HAS CAUSED A DECREASING ROLE OF NGO WITH CORRESPONDING INCREASE AND DOMINANT ROLE OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN THE ELABORATION OF UNIFORM LAW WITH A NEGATIVE REACTION OF NGO DURING THE PHASE OF APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNIFORM LAW INTO THE VARIOUS NATIONAL ORDER. TO AVOID SUCH INCONVENIENCE DETRIMENTAL TO THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE UNIFORM LAW IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO RESTORE A PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE INVOLVEMENT OF NGO IN THE PHASE OF THE ELABORATION OF UNIFORM LAW IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PREPARATORY WORKS WITHIN THE UN INSTITUTIONS WHICH SHALL PRESERVE THE SUCCESS OF UNIFORM LAW AND ITS PREVAILING EFFECT ON THE CORRESPONDING NATIONAL PROVISIONS WHERE THE UNIFORMITY REQUIRES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MANDATORY PROVISIONS NAMELY TOWARDS STATES AND PRIVATE ENTITIES. IN LIGHT WITH SAID CONCLUSION IT MAY ALSO BE EMPHASIZED THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS WITHIN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE OF THE VARIOUS SOURCES TOWARDS THE MOST ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS FOR A UNIFORM LAW SUITABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE.
333	THE PAPER ANALYSES THE MECHANISM OF A PENAL ORDER AS A CONSENSUAL PROCEDURE AIMED AT RELIEVING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CASES OF MINOR CRIMINAL OFFENCES BY AVOIDING A TRIAL. THE STUDY AIMS TO ANALYSE THE CROATIAN NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK AND CASE LAW IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE DISTINCTIVE TRAITS OF THE PENAL ORDER PROCEDURE IN A COMPARATIVE LEGAL CONTEXT, DISCLOSE THE PROCEDURAL REALITY AND DETECT ITS SHORTCOMINGS. THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ISSUING OF A PENAL ORDER, THE JUDICIAL CONTROL OF THE INDICTMENT REQUESTING A PENAL ORDER, THE DEFENCE RIGHTS IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ISSUING OF A PENAL ORDER AND THE POSITION OF THE VICTIM. THESE KEY ELEMENTS WERE RESEARCHED THROUGH NORMATIVE, THEORETICAL AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GERMAN, AUSTRIAN, ITALIAN AND FRENCH LAW AND CONCLUSIONS WERE TESTED IN THE CASE LAW OF THE MUNICIPAL CRIMINAL COURT IN ZAGREB AND THE MUNICIPAL COURT IN SPLIT. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH REVEAL THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE PENAL ORDER TO GRAVER OFFENCES PUNISHABLE BY FIVE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT AND TO MORE SEVERE PENALTIES SUCH AS DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY, AS WELL AS DEVIATIONS FROM SOME FUNDAMENTAL CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES INHERENT IN THE PENAL ORDER PROCEDURE, RAISE THE QUESTION OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES FOR THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM.
334	MOST MASTER OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (MPA) AND MASTER OF PUBLIC POLICY (MPP) PROGRAMS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FOCUS EXTENSIVELY ON POLICY ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT, AND LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND ADMINISTRATION (NASPAA), THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (ASPA), AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT (APPAM) HAVE DETERMINED THAT THESE AREAS COMPRISE THE CORE INTELLECTUAL AND PRACTICAL DIMENSIONS OF THE MPA AND MPP DEGREES. THE OMISSION OF REQUIRED CURRICULA THAT EMPHASIZE THE LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEORY AND PRACTICE SHOULD BE OF CENTRAL CONCERN TO THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EDUCATION COMMUNITY. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCE AS WELL AS A WIDE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE RULE THE OF LAW AFFECTS NEARLY EVERY DIMENSION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IF MPA/MPP GRADUATES ENTER THE PUBLIC SECTOR WORKFORCE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY CAN BE HELD PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY LIABLE IF THEY VIOLATE CITIZENS' CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHTS, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EDUCATORS HAVE NOT PROVIDED THEM WITH SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS NECESSARY FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY COMPETENT PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT.
335	HOW AND WHY ARE UNIVERSALIST MODES OF POLITICAL THOUGHT TRANSFORMED INTO CULTURALLY ESSENTIALIST AND EXCLUSIONARY PRACTICES OF GOVERNANCE AND LAW? THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THIS QUESTION BY ANALYZING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND LIBERALISM IN EAST ASIA. IT ARGUES THAT LIBERALISM, PARTICULARLY AS IT WAS USED IN ATTACKING CONFUCIANISM, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN EMBEDDING IDEAS OF CULTURAL PARTICULARISM AND CULTURAL ESSENTIALISM IN THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT AND LAW IN BOTH CHINA AND JAPAN. BOTH CONFUCIANISM AND LIBERALISM ARE SELF-IMAGINED AS UNIVERSALIST TRADITIONS, THEORETICALLY APPLICABLE TO ALL GLOBAL SOCIETIES. YET IN PRACTICE BOTH HAVE REGULARLY BEEN DEFINED IN CULTURALLY DETERMINED, CULTURALLY EXCLUSIVIST TERMS: CONFUCIANISM AS "CHINESE," LIBERALISM AS "BRITISH" OR "WESTERN." THE MEETING OF CONFUCIAN AND LIBERAL VISIONS OF UNIVERSALISM AND GLOBALISM IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY EAST ASIA PROVIDES AN INTRIGUING CASE STUDY FOR CONSIDERING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN UNIVERSALISM AND CULTURAL EXCLUSIVISM. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY GLOBAL LIBERALISM IN ATTACKS UPON THE PREVIOUS CONFUCIAN ORDER IN EAST ASIA, DEMONSTRATING THE COMPLICITY OF LIBERALISM IN NEW, CULTURALLY ESSENTIALIST AND PARTICULARIST CONSTRUCTIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND LAW IN BOTH CHINA AND JAPAN.
336	PURPOSE THIS STUDY, A SYMPOSIUM, AIMS TO EXPLORE THE DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION, IMPACT OF CROSS-COUNTRY INCOME-VARIATIONS ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION, DO HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES REALLY UPLIFT THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND DOES THE HIGHER FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX INDICATE THE LARGER ECONOMY? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY ADOPTS THE PANEL DATA MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY FURTHER ADOPTS THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS RATHER THAN SARMA'S APPROACH TO CALCULATE THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX. FINDINGS BASED ON THE DATA OF WORLD BANK, UNITED NATIONS, INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND, WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS, THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO NEXUS BETWEEN INCOME VARIATIONS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION, AS THE STUDY REVEALS THAT SOME LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX SUCH AS THAILAND (2.8538FII), BRAZIL (1.9526FII) AND TURKEY (0.8582FII). IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AGE DEPENDENCY RATIO AND URBANIZATION HAVE A NOTEWORTHY IMPACT ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION THAT ACCUMULATIVELY DESCRIBE THE 83% OF THE MODEL. WHEREAS, IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES, MERELY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND URBANIZATION HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE ON THE GROWTH OF FINANCIAL REVOLUTION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION THAT DESCRIBES THE 70% OF THE TOTAL. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE BIGGEST LIMITATION IS THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS PAPER IS ITS TECHNIQUE, WHICH IS USED IN THIS PAPER TO CALCULATE THE FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO 40 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES BASED ON INCOME, WHICH COULD HELP TO BOOST FINANCIAL INCLUSION, AND ULTIMATELY, IT LEADS THEM TOWARD ECONOMIC GROWTH.
337	WE DELVE INTO PERFORMANCE AND RISKINESS OF SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS (SC) INVESTMENT FUNDS WHILE CONSIDERING THE SALIENT ROLE OF HOME COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS AS PROXIED BY FREEDOM INDICATORS - NAMELY, ECONOMIC FREEDOM WITH ITS FIVE UNDERLYING COMPONENT AREAS - IN ADDITION TO THE PERSONAL AND OVERALL HUMAN FREEDOM OF COUNTRIES/REGIONS AS RELATED TO THE HOME BASE CURRENCY OF THOSE FUNDS. FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE AND INCLUDING NONLINEAR CONSIDERATIONS, EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ADVANCES IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ITS CONSTITUENT AREAS, AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES IN PERSONAL FREEDOM, HAVE A CONSISTENT SIZEABLE POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SC FUNDS BUT ALSO A SLIGHT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THEIR RISKINESS, ATTESTED TO BY VARIOUS ROBUSTNESS TESTS. WE ARTICULATE THE ADDED FINANCIAL BENEFITS TO BE GAINED WHEN BOTH SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FEATURES AND FREEDOM INFRASTRUCTURE ARE PRESENT, CONFIRMING THAT FREEDOM INDICATORS MATTER. THERE IS SUBTLE EVIDENCE THAT CHANGES IN LEGAL STRUCTURE AND SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, AS WELL AS SOUND MONEY, SHOW A STATISTICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON PERFORMANCE ACROSS VARIOUS SPECIFICATIONS. IN ACCORD WITH WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE RULE OF LAW, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT WITHOUT SOUND MONEY, A FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM, AND ENTRENCHED PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE PERFORMANCE OF SC FUNDS IS STALLED. & COPY; 2023 ECONOMIC SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA, QUEENSLAND.

338	THE VENICE COMMISSION WAS CREATED IN 1990, AS A PART OF A WIDER, GENEROUS PROJECT TO HELP THE FORMER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES WITH PROVISION OF WESTERN EXPERTISE. THE FLEDGLING EASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES WERE MEANT TO BE ABLE, IN THEIR EFFORT TO BUILD CONSTITUTIONAL, RULE OF LAW STATES, TO TAP AT SHORT NOTICE ON THE KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM OF AN APOLITICAL CONSTITUTIONAL AREOPAGUS. THE COMMISSION PROVED ADROIT AT THIS TASK AND ITS EARLY TRACK RECORD GENERATED A REPUTATIONAL SNOWBALL EFFECT. MORE AND MORE JURISDICTIONS HAVE JOINED IT AS MEMBERS, OBSERVERS OR SPECIAL STATUS ENTITIES, SPANNING NOW ALMOST ALL CONTINENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY ENGAGED IN AN INTENSE, FAST-PACE EFFORT AT MULTI-LAYER COOPERATION, LIAISING WITH BOTH OTHER STRUCTURES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE SYSTEM AND WITH COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (EU, OSCE/ODHIR, EVEN THE IMF). FOR INSTANCE, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RECENT EU POPULIST CRISES', THE EU COMMISSION HAS INCREASINGLYRELIED ON ITS COUNCIL OF EUROPE COLLEAGUE, IN ORDER TO PUT OUT THE POPULIST FIRE WITH THE HELP OF A GENUINE EXPERT IN THE FIELD OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW'. IN ITS NEWER ROLE, HOWEVER, THE VENICE COMMISSION HASOFTEN DISPLAYED AN UNSETTLING DEGREE OF MILITANCY, ALSO BY WAY OF CROSS-HYBRIDIZING POLICY IMPERATIVES AND NORMATIVE CRITERIA. ITS COUNTRY REPORTS AND GUIDELINES ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE WITH TRADITIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF VARIOUS CONCEPTS AND INSTITUTIONS (AND,FREQUENTLY ENOUGH, WITH ONE ANOTHER). BY THE SAME TOKEN, SUCH DETERMINATIONS REINFORCE, IN A VICIOUS CIRCLE, PREEXISTING DEFICIENCIES OF PROCEDURAL, METHODOLOGICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN. THE PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMISSION'S RECENT WORK, WITH A FOCUS ON RECENT ROMANIAN DEVELOPMENTS, COMPARATIVELY ASSESSED.
339	THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED BY DOMESTIC COURTS RELYING ON THE NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY. THESE CHALLENGES ARE NO LONGER LIMITED TO THE SOLANGE CASE LAW OF THE GERMAN BUNDESVERFASSUNGSGERICHT (BVERFG) AND THE CONTROLIMITI DOCTRINE OF THE ITALIAN CORTE COSTITUZIONALE. MORE RECENTLY, THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT INTRODUCED THE NOTION OF 'HISTORICAL CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY' - AT A TIME WHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY ARE IN RETREAT IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE EU. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU (CJEU) MISSED A FORMIDABLE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THE OUTER LIMITS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY UNDER ARTICLE 4(2) OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION IN TARICCO II. GIVEN PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL AS PARALLEL LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, IT CAN BE EXPLAINED WHY THE CJEU CHOSE TO SIDE-STEP THE ISSUE. HOWEVER, IN THE CORTE COSTITUZIONALE, THE CJEU FOUND A COOPERATIVE AND EU LAW-FRIENDLY INTERLOCUTOR WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT TO CLARIFY THESE LIMITS ON ITS OWN TERMS. THE CJEU CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT HIDE FROM THIS ISSUE FOREVER. THE NEXT DOMESTIC COURT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE MAY BE LESS INTERESTED IN JUDICIAL DIALOGUE AND MORE IN UNDERMINING THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW IN EVER MORE EXTENSIVE WAYS.
340	DESPITE ITS GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THERE HAS BEEN NOT TOO MUCH ACADEMIC INTEREST IN THE DOCTRINAL STRUCTURE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATED POWERS IN ART. 20 (2) (2) BASIC LAW SINCE 1949. MANY CONTRIBUTIONS CLAIMED THAT THE PRINCIPLE HAD NO NORMATIVE VALUE IN ITSELF, ONLY BEING THE SUM OF THE MORE SPECIFIC NORMS IN THE CONSTITUTION. BUT EVEN A FIRST LOOK AT THE CASE MATERIAL SHOWS THAT THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MAKES A REGULAR AND WIDE USE OF THE PRINCIPLE. THIS FACT AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGING THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF THE IDEA OF SEPARATED POWERS MAKE IT NECESSARY TO THINK OVER A SYSTEMATIC FRAME FOR THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE. AFTER AN ANALYSIS OF CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS OF THE COURT AND THE LITERARY DISCUSSION THE CONTRIBUTION TRIES TO DEVELOP A NEW ACCOUNT FOR A SYSTEMATIC DOCTRINE OF THE CONCEPT OF "SEPARATED POWERS" THAT STRESSES THE FACT THAT ART. 20 (2) (2) BASIC LAW DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THREE POWERS WITHOUT NECESSARILY SEPARATING THEM: THIS IS THE REASON TO NAME THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE "GEWALTENGLIEDERUNG", I.E. "ARRANGEMENT" OF POWERS. THE CENTRAL ASSUMPTION OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT THE MAIN FUNCTION OF A THREE-PARTED GOVERNMENT IS THE DISSOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC COLLECTIVE SELF-DETERMINATION AND THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM BY RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. DEMOCRACY AND RECHTSSTAAT ARE CODIFIED IN ART. 20 BASIC LAW. BOTH ENJOY THE SAME NORMATIVE VALUE, AND BOTH STAY IN A POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. INSTEAD OF SOLVING THIS CONFLICT BY ANY SUBSTANTIAL PRIORITY RULE THE CONSTITUTION DISSOLVES IT BY A GOVERNMENTAL DIVISION OF LABOUR IN WHICH THE LAW-PRODUCTION OF THE THREE BRANCHES DEVELOPS FROM THE OPEN, POLITICIZED, FUTURE-ORIENTED AND GENERAL FORM OF LEGISLATIVE DECISIO-NMAKING TO THE LEGALLY DETERMINED, PASTORIENTED AND HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. BETWEEN THESE TWO POLES ACTS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AS A MEDIATING STRUCTURE. THIS RECONSTRUCTION IS INTEGRATED INTO THE DOCTRINE OF THE BASIC LAW AND USED TO GIVE A SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL DEFINITION OF THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM, THE MEANING OF FEDERALISM FOR THE CONCEPT OF A THREE-PARTED GOVERNMENT, AND THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITHIN THIS SYSTEM.
341	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT WILL DISPLAY AN EVER-INCREASING PHENOMENON OF MEMBER STATES' INFRINGEMENTS OF EU MIGRATION AND ASYLUM LAW AS AN INSTANCE OF THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SOLIDARITY AND DISCUSS THE REASONS BEHIND IT. IT WILL BE SUGGESTED THAT EU INTER-STATE SOLIDARITY IS JUST AS MUCH ABOUT RESPECTING EU LAW, AS IT IS ABOUT HELPING EACH OTHER, AS THE LATTER CANNOT SUBSIST WITHOUT THE FORMER. SECOND, THE PAPER WILL CONSIDER WHETHER THE EXISTING MECHANISMS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS ARE SUFFICIENT AND DISCUSS THE NEW MECHANISMS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED-PARTICULARLY THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY AND OTHER CONDITIONALITY INSTRUMENTS. WHEN ADDRESSING THE REASONS BEHIND THE FREQUENT VIOLATIONS, THE TEXT WILL IDENTIFY TWO GROUPS OF REASONS, THE FIRST GROUP BEING APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE OF EU LAW, AND THE SECOND ONE SPECIFICALLY TO EU MIGRATION AND ASYLUM LAW. IN THIS CONTEXT, MEMBER STATES' VIOLATIONS WILL BE CONSTRUED AS THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL WITHDRAWAL OR RETRENCHMENT FROM CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COMMONLY ADOPTED EU MIGRATION AND ASYLUM LAW. THIS WILL BE EXPLAINED BY RELYING ON THE NOTION OF "SPILLBACK" OR DISINTEGRATION (AS OPPOSED TO FURTHER EUROPEAN INTEGRATION BASED ON THE NEOFUNCTIONALIST CONCEPT OF "SPILLOVER' EFFECT INTO MORE POLICY AREAS) AND ON THE CONCEPTS OF "EXIT" AND "VOICE" CONCEIVED BY ALBERT HIRSCHMAN AND DEVELOPED FURTHER BY JOSEPH WEILER IN HIS SEMINAL WORK "THE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPE".
342	DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE BY MODERN INTERNATIONAL LAW IN REGULATING THE USE OF FORCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, ARMED CONFLICTS REMAIN A DAILY REALITY EVEN AFTER THE ADOPTION OF THE UN CHARTER. THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF ARMED CONFLICTS IS DETERMINED BY HUMANE VALUES THAT ARE COMMON TO ALL MANKIND AND DO NOT DEPEND ON CONSIDERATIONS OF CULTURAL RELATIVISM.
343	THE TEXT AN INTRODUCTION THAT GIVES WAY TO BENEFITS - ARGUMENTS TO JUSTIFY THE CONSTITUCIONALITY OF OFFICE, THE PRIORITY OF THE RULES, THE PRINCIPLE "IURA NOVIT CURIA", THE INCONVENIENCES GENERATED INSIDE THE PROCEDURAL SYSTEM AS A RESULT CONTROL CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE, THE EXISTENCE OF CONTRADICTORY AND CHALLENGING PART, AND THE PRESUMPTION OF LEGITIMACY OF THE RULES. NEXT, THE CONSIDER THE FIGURE OF BROAD DISCUSSION AND SPECIFIC RUPTURE WITH THE BALANCE AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND FINALLY OUR VIEW OF PROBLEM, IT IS AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL AND CONSISTENCY TO THE DESING PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION, AND THERE, EQUALITY, FARINESS AND CERTAINTY IN LEGAL RELATIONS, TO CONCLUDE THE CONSTITUTIONAL VS CONTROL DUTY OF IMPARTIALITY OF JUDGES AS CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE, THE LIMITATION OF THE POWERS OF THE JUDGE AS GUARANTEE FOR THE CITIZEN, AND THE INAPPLICABILITY OF THE APHORISM "IURA NOVIT CURIA" IN EXISTING GUARANTOR OF PROCEDURAL MODEL.
344	IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT HAS ACTED TO RESTRICT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS. THE LEGALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC ATTENTION AND LITIGATION IN THE COURTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TAKE A THEORETICAL VIEW OF THE QUESTION OF LEGALITY IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY. WE CHARACTERISE THE CHALLENGES THAT EMERGENCIES POSE TO THE ORDINARY LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON PUBLIC POWER, SUCH AS FORMAL LIMITATIONS REQUIRING STATUTORY AUTHORISATION, PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ABUSE. WE THEN RELATE THESE CHALLENGES TO TIMELESS QUESTIONS IN LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUBJECTION OF POLITICAL POWER TO LEGAL RULES, ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MERE PRETENCE AND ROBUST COMMITMENTS TO LEGALITY, AND ABOUT LAW'S LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY AND ITS LEGITIMATE COERCION. FOCUSING ON QUESTIONS MOST RELEVANT TO THE NEW ZEALAND CONTEXT, WE FIRST EXAMINE THE VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AUTHORISATION OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTION BY LEGAL RULES, AND EXPLAIN WHY A FORMAL FIXATION ON 'AUTHORISATION' IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVE THESE VALUES. WE THEN SHOW HOW LEGALITY'S VALUE IN SUPPORTING LAW'S AUTHORITY AND GUARDING AGAINST ILLEGITIMATE COERCION DEPENDS (AT LEAST IN PART) UPON ITS EVEN OPERATION AMIDST THE CONTEXTUAL AND CONTESTED REALITIES OF THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWER.
345	IN THIS ARTICLE I COMPARE MICHAEL OAKESHOTT'S AND JURGEN HABERMAS' RESPECTIVE ACCOUNTS OF MORALITY, RATIONALITY AND POLITICS. I SHOW THAT THEY BOTH THEORISE THE CONDITIONS OF THE MODERN POLITICAL COMMUNITY AS A CIVIL ASSOCIATION, AND I ARGUE THAT THIS COMPARISON ENABLES US TO CHALLENGE PREDOMINANT UNDERSTANDINGS OF EACH THINKER AND TO ADDRESS CRITICISMS LEVELLED AGAINST THEM. I DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CONTEXTUALIST AND HEGELIAN ASPECTS OF HABERMAS' EARLIER WORK ARE CARRIED OVER INTO HIS LATER WORK ON DISCOURSE ETHICS AND THAT HE PUTS FORWARD A MORE SITUATED UNDERSTANDING OF RATIONALITY AND MORALITY THAN IS USUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED. I ALSO SHOW THAT OAKESHOTT IS NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD CONSERVATIVE AND IN SOME RESPECT HE CAN BE SEEN AS A FORERUNNER OF DELIBERATIVE POLITICS. HOWEVER, THIS COMPARISON TAKES US BEYOND AN EXERCISE IN INTERPRETATION, AND I ALSO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE PRACTICAL POSSIBILITIES RESIDING IN THE WORK OF OAKESHOTT AND HABERMAS. INDEED, IT IS MY CONTENTION THAT EACH OF THEIR APPROACHES HAS MUCH TO OFFER IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF PLURALISM CHARACTERISTIC OF CONTEMPORARY MULTICULTURAL SOCIETIES AND THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE WORKS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A CONTEMPORARY THEORY OF CRITICAL REPUBLICANISM.
346	BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WAS CREATED AS A RESPONSE TO THE TRUST CRISIS THAT SWEPT THE WORLD IN THE WAKE OF THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. BITCOIN AND OTHER BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS WERE PRESENTED AS A "TRUSTLESS" ALTERNATIVE TO EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN GOVERNMENTS. YET, WHILE THE TRUSTLESS NATURE OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN HEAVILY QUESTIONED, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE AS TO WHAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES ACTUALLY BRING TO THE TABLE IN PLACE OF TRUST. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS FROM THE EXTENSIVE ACADEMIC DISCUSSION ON THE CONCEPTS OF "TRUST" AND "CONFIDENCE" TO ARGUE THAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A 'TRUSTLESS TECHNOLOGY' BUT RATHER A 'CONFIDENCE MACHINE'. FIRST, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A REVIEW OF THE MULTIFACETED CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO CONCEPTS. SECOND, THE CLAIM IS MADE THAT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY RELIES ON CRYPTOGRAPHIC RULES, MATHEMATICS, AND GAME-THEORETICAL INCENTIVES IN ORDER TO INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THE OPERATIONS OF A COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEM. YET, SUCH AN INCREASE IN CONFIDENCE ULTIMATELY RELIES ON THE PROPER OPERATION AND GOVERNANCE OF THE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN-BASED NETWORK, WHICH REQUIRES TRUSTING A VARIETY OF ACTORS. THIRD, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLYCENTRIC GOVERNANCE THEORY TO EXPLORE THE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES OF BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS, IN LIGHT OF THE TENSION BETWEEN PROCEDURAL CONFIDENCE AND TRUST.
347	PECULIARITY OF PRISONERS' CORRECTION IS CONNECTED WITH THE SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL STRATIFICATION AND NORMS OF CRIMINAL SUBCULTURE THAT EXIST IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT: COMMITTING ILLEGAL ACTS FOR THEM IS HABITUAL, ORDINARY. TRADITIONAL MEANS OF CORRECTION ARE CONNECTED WITH THE FORMATION OF NON-CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR ON THE VERGE OF LEGITIMACY AND CRIMINALITY - MARGINAL OR CONFORMIST LAWFUL BEHAVIOR. ON THE ONE HAND, ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCH OBJECTIVES IS A PARAMETER OF POSITIVE DYNAMICS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PERSON, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS A WEAK GUARANTEE OF THE FURTHER LAWFUL WAY OF LIFE OF THE PRISONER AFTER RELEASE. IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE FACT THAT OUTSIDE OF A PENAL INSTITUTION THERE ARE NO DETERRENTS WHICH DO NOT ALLOW THE MARGINAL BEHAVIOR TO TRANSFORM INTO THE ILLEGAL ONE, WHICH CAUSES A HIGH LEVEL OF POST-PENAL RECIDIVISM. CORRECTION SHOULD NOT COVER EXCLUSIVELY THE PENAL SPHERE OF ACTIVITY OF THE PRISONER AND BE SHOWN ONLY IN PREVENTING PENAL RECIDIVISM. CORRECTION OF PRISONERS SHOULD CONSIST IN CREATION OF STRONG, STABLE MOTIVES FOR NOT COMMITTING A CRIME AFTER RELEASE, IRRESPECTIVELY FROM THE CHANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS COMMITTING. IT IS REQUIRED TO SHAPE THE PRISONER'S SOCIALLY-ACTIVE MODEL OF THE LAWFUL BEHAVIOR BASED ON THE INTERNAL CONVICTION OF THE PERSON IN THE INADMISSIBILITY OF COMMITTING A CRIME. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THE MOTIVATION OF BEHAVIOR OF PRISONERS WITH ITS EXTERNAL POSITIVISM CAN HAVE A MARGINAL, NOT SOCIALLY-ACTIVE CHARACTER. TRADITIONAL MEANS OF CORRECTION ARE PERCEIVED NEGATIVELY BY PRISONERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FORCED CHARACTER, RELIGION ACTS AS A BUFFER BETWEEN PRISONERS AND THE ADMINISTRATION, RELIGIOUS IDEAS ARE COMMON FOR PRISONERS AND INFLUENCE THEM POSITIVELY. SPIRITUAL AND MORAL WORK OF THE CHURCH ESSENTIALLY SUPPLEMENTS, IF NOT REPLACES THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE OF PENAL INSTITUTIONS, FOR CLERGYMEN AND THEIR ASSISTANTS GIVE THIS QUESTION OF MORE TIME THAN THE ADMINISTRATION DOES. UNLIKE COOPERATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PENAL INSTITUTION, COOPERATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IS NOT REPREHENSIBLE IN THE CRIMINAL WORLD. RELIGION IS A CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL AND LEGAL CULTURES OF PRISONERS. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL MEANS OF CORRECTION (EDUCATIONAL WORK, SOCIALLY USEFUL WORK, GENERAL EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL INFLUENCE), PARTICIPATION OF THE CONVICTED PRISONER IN THE ACTIVITY OF RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IS DIRECTED ON THE FORMATION OF INTERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIENTATIONS PREVENTING FURTHER CRIMES NOT FOR THE FEAR OF RESPONSIBILITY, BUT FROM THE COMPREHENSION OF INADMISSIBILITY OF SUCH ACTIONS. THIS INFLUENCE IS DIRECTED ON THE FORMATION OF A SOCIALLY-ACTIVE LAWFUL BEHAVIOR DESCRIBED BY THE MOST ADVANCED STAGE OF THE POSITIVE MOTIVATION OF THE PERSON.
348	I ARGUE THAT WE CANNOT HAVE LEGAL ORDER WITHOUT JUDGES WHO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES THAT TRANSCENDS THE LAW OF THEIR LAND. BUT THIS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, RATHER THAN OF THE MORAL CONTENT OF THE LAW. MOREOVER, THE REASON WE CANNOT HAVE LEGAL ORDER WITHOUT JUDGES IS THAT LAW MUST CLAIM NOT ONLY AUTHORITY BUT ALSO LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OVER ITS SUBJECTS. IT FOLLOWS THAT THE WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ANY KIND OF ANALYSIS OF CASES IN ORDER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT JUDGES SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT DO REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS SCEPTICAL ABOUT JUDICIAL REVIEW OPENLY REVISE A FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENT-THE PRACTICALLY UNREALIZABLE COMMITMENT TO HAVE LAW WITHOUT JUDGES. BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMMON LAW TRADITION, INCLUDING RONALD DWORKIN, TO ATTEND MORE TO THE INDEPENDENT STATUS OF LEGALITY. IN SUM, THE FOCUS ON THE QUESTION ` WHAT IS A JUDGE?' BRINGS WITH IT ATTENTION BOTH TO THE IDEA OF LEGALITY AND TO THE SPECIFIC AUTHORITY OF LAW.
349	THE STUDY PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING DEMOCRATIC REGIMES IN LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN ANALYSED IN RECENT YEARS. TO THIS END, THE TEXT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS: THE FIRST CONTAINS A CRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE LITERATURE THAT ANALYSES THE PROCESSES OF TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO DEMOCRATIC ONES, WHILE THE SECOND EXAMINES HOW ANALYSTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE DEMOCRATIC REGIMES THAT EXIST IN THE REGION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE SECOND PART CONTAINS THREE SECTIONS THAT BRIEFLY COVER THE FOLLOWING ISSUES: THE WAYS IN WHICH THIS TYPE OF DEMOCRACIES HAS BEEN DESCRIBED, WHAT THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN THE NATURE OF THE REGIMES AND DEMOCRACY AND, FINALLY, THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DEBATE ON THE "QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY". IN THIS LAST SECTION, THE AUTHOR PLACES EMPHASIS ON THE DILEMMA EXPERIENCED BY ANALYSTS ATTEMPTING TO STUDY THE SUBJECT OF DEMOCRACY FROM AN EMPIRICAL OR NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE.
350	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES ENACTED DURING THE EMERGENCY SITUATION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE SOURCES OF LAW AND OF THEIR IMPACT ON ALREADY DISCRIMINATED OR VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF THESE MEASURES ON WOMEN, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, MIGRANTS AND DETAINEES. THE DESCRIBED SITUATION HAS THEREFORE CHALLENGED THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM.
351	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES MACHIAVELLI'S AND SCHMITT'S VIEWS ON EMERGENCIES. BOTH PHILOSOPHERS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR EMPHASIS ON THE UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF POLITICS, WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY CAPTURED BY LEGAL NORMS. THUS, THEY BOTH STATE THAT EVERY POLITICAL ORDER REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE WHO COULD ACT BEYOND LAWS DURING EMERGENCIES. FOR MACHIAVELLI, THIS FIGURE IS CALLED A DICTATOR; FOR SCHMITT, IT IS THE SOVEREIGN. THE AUTHOR AIMS TO SHOW THAT, DESPITE THIS APPARENT SIMILARITY, MACHIAVELLI AND SCHMITT CONCEPTUALIZE THE EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT MANNER. MACHIAVELLI REGARDS DICTATORSHIP MERELY AS A LEGAL INSTRUMENT BOUND BY THE CONSTITUTION. A DICTATOR ONLY ACTS TO PROTECT THE EXISTING ORDER, WHICH HE CANNOT ALTER. ON THE CONTRARY, SCHMITT'S CONCEPTUALIZATION OF EXCEPTION SUGGESTS THAT THE SOVEREIGN IS NOT BOUND BY ANY LEGAL NORM. SOVEREIGNTY IMPLIES THAT THIS EXTRAORDINARY FIGURE CAN SUSPEND AND EVEN ALTER THE EXISTING LEGAL ORDER. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MACHIAVELLI'S AND SCHMITT'S DIVERSE ATTITUDES TOWARDS LAW STEMS FROM THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE NATURE OF POLITICAL UNITY. WHILE MACHIAVELLI PERCEIVES POLITY AS COMPOSED OF TWO DISTINCT GROUPS WITH INCOMPATIBLE INTERESTS, SCHMITT DEFINES POLITY AS A HOMOGENOUS ONE. FOR MACHIAVELLI THE SURVIVAL OF POLITICAL UNITY DEPENDS ON A MIXED CONSTITUTION AND RESPECT FOR LAWS THAT HOLD SOCIETY TOGETHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SCHMITT, IT DEPENDS ON THE PRESERVATION OF ITS HOMOGENEITY.
352	LARRY MAY MAKES SOME IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS ABOUT HOBBES ON LAW AND PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NOTION OF EQUITY FOR HOBBES, BOTH AS A MORAL LAW AND AS A (POSSIBLY LIMITING) REQUIREMENT OF A SOVEREIGN'S LAWMAKING AUTHORITY. I AM GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF MAY'S PROJECT WHILE REMAINING SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE CONCLUSION THAT A SELFRESTRAINING SOVEREIGN IS A GENUINELY LIMITED SOVEREIGN.
353	THIS PAPER SHOWS WHY CORRUPTION IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO DETECT UNDER CHINA'S SYSTEM OF DECENTRALIZED AUTHORITARIAN RULE, WHICH I CALL A "RULE OF MANDATES." LOCAL OFFICIALS MUST PURSUE HIGH PRIORITY POLITICAL TARGETS BUT HAVE IMMENSE DISCRETION OVER WHICH LAWS TO IMPLEMENT. A RELATIVE STANDARD FOR CORRUPTION CONSEQUENTLY ARISES SINCE NON-IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS MAY BE MANDATE-SERVING OR MAY BE CORRUPT; AND DETERMINING WHICH REQUIRES EXTRA INFORMATION ON WHY NON-IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRED. THE THEORY IS SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE FROM ORIGINAL SURVEY AND CASE RESEARCH ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE VILLAGE ELECTIONS LAW. I DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS FOR ANTICORRUPTION EFFORTS, DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH. (C) 2013 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
354	PROFESSOR VANBERG RECEIVED THE TITLE OF PROFESSOR HONORIS CAUSA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BUCHAREST FOR HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS. ON THIS OCCASION, HE MADE A BRIEF PRESENTATION OF THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GERMAN ORDOLIBERALISM AND ITS IMPACT. HE FURTHER DEVELOPED ON HOW THE FREIBOURG SCHOOL REFLECTED UPON THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS NEEDED FOR THE CREATION OF AN ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION.
355	CHILD MARRIAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE RAISED THE LEGAL AGE OF MARRIAGE, BUT THE INCIDENCE OF EARLY MARRIAGE REMAINS HIGH. WE PROPOSE A SIMPLE TEST FOR WHETHER LAWS ARE EFFECTIVE IN DETERRING EARLY MARRIAGE AND APPLY IT TO DATA FROM BOTH THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEYS (DHS) AND MULTIPLE INDICATOR CLUSTER SURVEYS (MICS) COVERING OVER 100 COUNTRIES USING STATISTICAL TESTS DERIVED FROM THE REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY LITERATURE. BY THIS MEASURE, MANY COUNTRIES ARE NOT ENFORCING THE LAWS ON THEIR BOOKS, AND ENFORCEMENT MAY BE NOT BE IMPROVING OVER TIME. WE ARGUE THAT SURVEY DATA PROVIDES A SIMPLE WAY TO TEST IF LAWS ARE BEING ENFORCED AND ARE BINDING, AND INTERPRET OUR RESULTS TO SHOW THAT LEGAL CHANGE NEEDS TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY BETTER ENFORCEMENT AND GREATER MONITORING TO BE EFFECTIVE.
356	ALTHOUGH THE FIGURE OF THE WISE JUDGE MAY BE A UNIVERSAL TROPE, RESPECT IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ACCORDED EVERY PERSON WHO PASSES JUDGMENT ON ANOTHER. TO BE PERCEIVED AS LEGITIMATE, JUDGES MUST OCCUPY AN INSTITUTIONAL STATUS WITH THE POWER TO DECIDE CONTROVERTED CASES AND MUST HAVE ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED OR EVEN SACRED KNOWLEDGE AND MORAL AUTHORITY. HISTORICALLY, ASIAN JUDGES COULD CLAIM LEGITIMACY THROUGH THEIR CONNECTION TO TRANSCENDENT LEGAL PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS DHAMMA OR DAO OR SHARI'A. IN CONTEMPORARY ASIA, HOWEVER, CONCEPTIONS OF LAW AND LEGAL LEGITIMACY HAVE BECOME PLURALISTIC, CONTESTED, AND CONTRADICTORY. JUDGES MAY TO SOME EXTENT RETAIN A CONNECTION TO THE SACRED AND THE TRANSCENDENT, YET THAT CONNECTION IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT IN ITSELF TO INSULATE THEIR JUDGMENTS -OR THEIR CHARACTER- FROM CRITICISM. HOW, THEN, CAN THE "GOOD JUDGE" BE DISTINGUISHED FROM JUDGES WHO FALL SHORT OF THE MARK? IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE, FIVE DISTINGUISHED SCHOLARS EXPLORE THE CRISIS OF LEGITIMATION AS IT AFFECTS JUDGING AND JUDGMENT IN SRI LANKA, INDIA, CHINA, INDONESIA, AND THAILAND.
357	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO REVIEW SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE WORK OF THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL THEORIST FRANZ NEUMANN, THE AUTHOR OF BEHEMOTH. THE STRUCTURE AND PRACTICE OF NATIONAL SOCIALISM (1942). AGAINST THE CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SOCIALISM AS A FORM OF "STATECAPITALISM" (F. POLLOCK, M. HORKHEIMER), NEUMANN ARGUES THAT GERMAN FASCISM SHOULD BE READ AS A FORM OF "TOTALITARIAN MONOPOLY CAPITALISM", THAT PRESERVES THE PRIMACY OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND THREATENS ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THE MODERN IDEA OF STATE. NEUMANN'S STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POWER, LAW AND SOVEREIGNTY.
358	TO DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF THE PRO-CONSUMER PRINCIPLE, THE HISTORICAL-LEGAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE DOGMATIC POSTULATES THAT SEEK THE REESTABLISHMENT OF EQUILIBRIUM IN LEGAL RELATIONS IS STUDIED, CONSIDERING IT AS ONE OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW. LIKEWISE, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE AXIOM IS INVESTIGATED, STARTING FROM THE EXAMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOR, WHICH IN TURN CONSTITUTES THE FRAMEWORK OF FAVOR DEBITORIS, FAVOR DEBILIS, AS WELL AS ITS CONNECTION WITH THE RULE OF INTERPRETATION CONTRA PROFERENTEM. THIS EXPLORATION IS PERTINENT SINCE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE IS CONSTITUTED AS A PREC-EDENT OF THE PRO-CONSUMER PRINCIPLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLE IS APPROACHED FROM THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IT SHARES THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS THAT INSTITUTE THE OTHER GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW, BEARING IN MIND THE ROLE ASSIGNED TO IT IN THE LEGISLATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES, CONCLUD-ING WITH THE OBSERVATION OF ITS MANIFESTATIONS IN THE COLOMBIAN LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS ITS APPLICATION BY THE LEGAL OPERATORS, WHO ARE GENERALLY MAKING USE OF THE INTERPRETATIVE FUNCTION, MAKE DECISIONS IN FAVOR OF THE CONSUMER WHEN DOUBTS OR AMBIGUITIES ARISE WITHIN THE CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP.
359	THE THEMATIC PLURALITY AND THE PROLIXITY OF THE TEXTS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF COLOMBIA OF 1991 ALLOW IT TO BE STUDIED AND CONSIDERED FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND CRITERIA, BOTH DOCTRINAL AND ARGUMENTATIVE. ON THIS OCCASION, WE WILL PROCEED TO DEMARCATE THOSE FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT THAT ALLOW US TO HIGHLIGHT ITS CORRELATION WITH THE POSTULATES THAT, REGARDING THE THEORY OF NATURAL LAW, JAVIER HERVADA HAS ESTABLISHED. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE CRITERIA OF A DIALOGICAL METHODOLOGY WILL BE USED, THROUGH WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A KIND OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS AND THE POSTULATES THAT HERVADA EXPRESSES, WHICH ARE TYPICAL OF THE SO-CALLED NATURAL LAW.THE METHOD USED IN THIS RESEARCH DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM THE METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE USED, SINCE IT CORRESPONDS TO THE DIALOGICAL CRITERIA BETWEEN TEXTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONCEPTUAL REASONING THAT DENOTES THE CONCEP-TUAL IDENTITY BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHARTER AND THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW. NATURAL, EXPRESSED IN THE WORK OF HERVADA.WITH THIS PAPER WE INTEND TO ADDRESS A CONCEPTUAL PROBLEM THAT DEMANDS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CRITERIA OF A CONCEPTUAL ASPECT OF LAW, SUCH AS NATURAL LAW, BE CLARIFIED FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE, WITH AN APPARENTLY NEUTRAL TEXT, IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT IT REFERS TO ITS IDEOLOGICAL SOURCE, SUCH AS THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF COLOMBIA, WHICH IN ITS PRACTICAL DEVELOPMENT, AND MORE IN THE EVOLUTION, WHICH THE JUDICIARY HAS GIVEN IT, HAS BEEN VALUED FROM THE CRITERIA OF LEGAL POSITIVISM, OF LEGAL REALISM, AND EVEN FROM THE ORBIT OF IUS-NATURALISM.
360	DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHINA'S ATROCITIES IN XINJIANG IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA'S HISTORICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH UN AND ITS HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES AUTOCRACIES' IMPACT ON THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. IT ARGUES THAT THAT RATHER THAN CREATING NEW LAW THAT TURNS INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A WHOLE (MORE) AUTHORITARIAN, THE CHINESE PARTY-STATE IS PRIMARILY-AND EVEN MORE DANGEROUSLY-CORRODING ITS INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES, WHILE EXPANDING NEO-TOTALITARIAN GOVERNANCE DISCOURSES AND PRACTICES TO THE GLOBAL LEVEL. THE AUTOCRATIC CORROSION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW INSTITUTIONS IS EXACERBATED BY ATTEMPTS TO WEAKEN ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW FROM WITHIN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, AMOUNTING TO SYNERGIC CORROSIVE EFFECTS. YET, THE CORROSION OF PRACTICES NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS MUST NOT BE EQUATED WITH THE ELIMINATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS POWERFUL IDEAS UNDERPINNING RESPONSES TO THE INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED HERE.
361	AGAINST RECENT CRITICISM, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY INDEX (EDI) HAS SCALE PROPERTIES THAT ARE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE NORMATIVE PREMISES OF THE INDEX'S CONSTRUCTION LOGIC. EMPIRICALLY, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE EDI DEVIATES FROM ALL OTHER INDICES OF DEMOCRACY IN A PERFECTLY INTENDED WAY THAT INCORPORATES SUBSTANTIATING QUALITIES OF DEMOCRACY WHICH THE OTHER INDICES NEGLECT. AS A RESULT, THE EDI OUTPERFORMS ALL OTHER DEMOCRACY INDICES IN ITS ASSOCIATIVE STRENGTH WITH KEY THEORETICAL CORRELATES OF DEMOCRACY, CONDITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL. FROM A SUBSTANTIVE POINT OF VIEW, THE EDI IS THE MOST RELIABLE AND VALID INDEX OF DEMOCRACY THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.
362	TO FACILITATE THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF PATIENTS' RIGHTS LAWS, SOME COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE DEVELOPED PATIENT OMBUDSMAN SYSTEMS. ABOUT 20 MENT. NOWADAYS, THE COUNTRY HAS OMBUDSMEN IN EACH OF ITS 19 COUNTIES. SINCE 2001 THE PATIENT OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION GOT ITS LEGAL BASIS THROUGH THE ACT ON PATIENTS' RIGHTS. THE MAIN ROLE OF THIS PROFESSIONAL IS TO SAFEGUARD PATIENTS AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES QUALITY. IN ORDER TO REALIZE THAT OMBUDSMEN GIVE GUIDANCE, HELP PATIENTS HAVING THEIR PROBLEMS CLARIFIED WITH THE HEALTH SERVICE AND BRING CASES TO THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY AND TO THE SYSTEM FOR ECONOMIC COMPENSATION. BASED ON EUROPEAN AND IN PARTICULAR NORWEGIAN EXPERIENCE, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSS THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE PATIENT OMBUDSMAN SCHEME.
363	THERE HAS BEEN MUCH TALK OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN RECENT YEARS, BUT THE CHANGES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TAKING PLACE HAVE OFTEN DIFFERED MARKEDLY FROM THOSE THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS PROFESSED TO ESPOUSE AND HAVE SHAKEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WITHOUT FOLLOWING ANY COHERENT OVERALL PLAN. WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS ARE NOT WITHOUT SHORTCOMINGS; THE CONVENTIONS THAT HELD THE OLD BRITISH CONSTITUTION IN PLACE ARE IN ANY CASE DIFFICULT TO CODIFY OR ENFORCE. BUT A PRESSING PROBLEM WITH AN UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION IS THAT THERE IS NO SPECIAL MECHANISM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. RECENT REFORMS HAVE THEREFORE BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY AND SPIN. THE CURE IS NOT SIMPLE.(1) AS A TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR SIR JOHN BAKER QC, WHO HAS SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE EDITORIAL BOARD SINCE THE ECCLESIASTICAL LAW JOURNAL'S FOUNDATION AND ENERGETICALLY CONTINUES TO DO SO,(2) I AM PLEASED TO REPRODUCE THE LIGHTLY EDITED TEXT OF HIS BRITISH ACADEMY MACCABBAEAN LECTURE.(3) DELIVERED IN 2009, THOUGH STILL TOPICAL TODAY, IT PROVIDES A CAUTIONARY CRITIQUE OF THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM'S UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION WHICH I HOPE WILL SERVE AS A PRELUDE TO AN OCCASIONAL SERIES OF ARTICLES AND COMMENT IN THE PAGES OF THIS JOURNAL CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF THE SPIRITUAL WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE ESTABLISHED NATURE OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. MATTERS THAT HAVE BEEN IGNORED OR MARGINALISED IN THE RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION INCLUDE THE ROLE OF THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS AND ARCHBISHOPS AND THE ECCLESIASTICAL PATRONAGE EXERCISED BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR. [EDITOR]
364	ONE WAY IN WHICH LAW PROTECTS DIGNITY IS BY ENFORCING HUMAN RIGHTS PROVISIONS THAT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT DEGRADATION. BUT, AS LON FULLER AND OTHERS HAVE OBSERVED, LAW'S CONNECTION WITH DIGNITY IS ALSO DEEPER AND MORE PERVASIVE THAN THIS. IN THE WAY THAT ITS REQUIREMENTS ARE PRESENTED, IN ITS PROCEDURES, IN ITS SPONSORSHIP OF ARGUMENTATION, IN TREATING PEOPLE AS EQUALS, EVEN IN THE DISTINCTIVE WAY IN WHICH IT MAKES USE OF COERCION, LAW TREATS HUMANS AS DIGNIFIED AGENTS, CAPABLE OF SELF-CONTROL, WITH A GOOD SENSE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS, AND AN ABILITY TO RESPOND INTELLIGENTLY TO ITS DEMANDS.
365	THE AFFINITIES LINKING AS WELL AS DIFFERENCES DIVIDING THE THOUGHT OF THOMAS MORE AND THE THOUGHT OF SHAKESPEARE DESERVE OUR ATTENTION FOR THE LIGHT SUCH COMPARATIVE SCRUTINY CASTS UPON EACH MAN'S POSITION WITH RESPECT TO ISSUES OF THEIR TIME AND IN REGARD TO QUESTIONS CONTINUALLY BECKONING TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH ONCE MORE. THEIR MUTUAL CONCERNS INCLUDE MORAL CULTIVATION, STATESMANSHIP, THE CHARACTER OF REGIMES IN HEALTH AND IN DISORDER, THE NATURE OF LAW DIVINE AND HUMAN, THE RELATION THAT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE. AN INQUIRY INTO BOTH MORE'S EXPLICITLY CONVEYED ARGUMENTS TOGETHER WITH SHAKESPEARE'S LARGELY IMPLICIT COURSE OF REASONING SHOULD BEGIN BY NOTING THEIR APPARENT AGREEMENT UPON MORAL AND CIVIL CONCERNS. YET SUCH AN INVESTIGATION SHOULD PROCEED TO MATTERS BEARING UPON FAITH AND REASON, ISSUES IT APPEARS ARE VIEWED DIFFERENTLY BY THE TWO THINKERS. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST THE DIVERGENCE THAT COMES TO SIGHT IN COMPARING MORE'S DEDICATION TO PRESERVING INDEPENDENCE OF CHURCH FROM CIVIL AUTHORITY WITH SHAKESPEARE'S APPARENT ENDORSEMENT OF A TUDOR ERASTIAN SETTLEMENT.(1)
366	IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT POLICING CAN BE DEFENDED AS CONSISTENT WITH THE EQUALITY OF ALL BEFORE THE LAW - BUT NOT BY DENYING THAT POLICING OCCUPIES A SPECIAL PLACE IN OUR LEGAL ORDER THAT IS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO CERTAIN ANCIEN REGIME PRIVILEGES. IN ORDER TO DEFEND THE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES OF POLICING, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE ANCIEN REGIME PRIVILEGES THAT THEY IN SOME RESPECTS RESEMBLE. THE CRUCIAL CONCEPTUAL TOOL FOR MAKING THAT ARGUMENT IS THE IDEA OF PUBLIC OFFICE. POLICING, I ARGUE, IS A PUBLIC OFFICE AND LIKE OTHER PUBLIC OFFICES, IT COMES EQUIPPED WITH A NUMBER OF SPECIAL RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES, POWERS, AND IMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT GENERALLY POSSESSED BY ALL PERSONS IN THEIR PRIVATE CAPACITY. BUT THAT SITUATION IS NO CHALLENGE TO THE EQUALITY OF ALL PERSONS BEFORE THE LAW. THOSE SPECIAL RIGHTS DO NOT BELONG TO THE OFFICE-HOLDER AS THEIR PRIVATE PROPERTY, TO DO WITH THEM JUST AS THEY WOULD LIKE. THEY BELONG, INSTEAD, TO THE OFFICE ITSELF, AND THEY MAY BE EXERCISED ONLY BY SOMEONE DULY APPOINTED TO THE OFFICE (WHO MAY ALSO BE DULY REMOVED FROM OFFICE) AND ONLY IN PURSUIT OF THE PURPOSES THAT DEFINE HER OFFICE. THE IDEA OF PUBLIC OFFICE IS WHAT MAKES POSSIBLE A NECESSARY AND ACCEPTABLE KIND OF INEQUALITY - THAT BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PERSONS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE COLLECTIVE PERSON OF THE STATE ON THE OTHER - WHILE MAINTAINING THE KIND OF EQUALITY THAT MATTERS, WHICH IS THE EQUALITY OF ALL PERSONS VIS-A-VIS ONE ANOTHER.
367	THIS STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS TO SHOW INCREASING PRESSURES OVER THE CENTRAL BANK OF TURKEY (CBT) THROUGHOUT THE PAST DECADE WHERE THE CBT GIVES INTO SUCH PRESSURES, DESPITE THE CENTRAL BANK LAW, WHICH ENSURES TOOL INDEPENDENCE. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CBT REFLECT RECENT POLITICAL CHANGES WHERE THE GOVERNMENT INCREASED ITS CONTROL OVER STATE INSTITUTIONS, FOLLOWING RISING COSTS OF LOSING OFFICE. HOWEVER, THIS TREND NOT ONLY HAS ECONOMIC COSTS SUCH AS A RESTRICTED CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE PRICE STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH BUT IT ALSO LIMITS HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS.
368	REGULATORY ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL DEGREE OF AMBIGUITY, WHICH HAS TO BE COUNTERBALANCED WITH A SPECIFIC LEGAL FRAMEWORK. A CLEAR LEGAL DEFINITION OF THE GENERAL INTEREST AND A DETAILED MOTIVATION BY THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE PROPORTIONALITY OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO BE IMPOSED, WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE EFFICIENT JURISDICTIONAL CONTROL OF ALL ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATORY ACTIVITY. BY DOING THIS, LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE PROTECTION OF COMPANIES AND USERS' RIGHTS WOULD BE REINFORCED.
369	THE CREATION OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION AGAINST CORRUPTION (ICAC) IN FEBRUARY 1974 WAS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN HONG KONG SINCE 1945. NOT ONLY DID MAJOR CORRUPTION SYNDICATES DISAPPEAR FROM THE FABRIC OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE COLONY, BUT THE POPULAR ACCEPTANCE OF BRIBERY AS A COMPONENT OF SOCIAL LIFE ALSO FADED AWAY. SIR MURRAY MACLEHOSE, WHO SERVED AS GOVERNOR OF HONG KONG BETWEEN 1971 AND 1982, WAS REGARDED BY LOCALS AS THE MAVERICK BEHIND THIS MIRACLE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE GENESIS OF THE ICAC COULD BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS A PRODUCT OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFORTS OF MACLEHOSE AND HIS PREDECESSORS. THE INITIATIVE SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED IN THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF THE RISING TENSION BETWEEN LONDON AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. IN A WAY, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ICAC HELPED PRE-EMPT LONDON'S INTERVENTION IN THIS MATTER. ALSO, DESPITE A PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF UNBRIDLED SUPPORT FOR THE CRUSADE AGAINST CORRUPTION, MACLEHOSE'S RESOLVE WAS SEVERELY TESTED DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE ICAC, AND HE DID CONTEMPLATE MODERATING THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION, EVEN BEFORE THE PARTIAL AMNESTY IN 1977.
370	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A TYPOLOGY OF DIMINISHED SUBTYPES OF RECHTSSTAAT. BUILDING ON A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND GERMANY, AN IDEAL TYPE OF RECHTSSTAAT IS IDENTIFIED. TH IS DEFINITION PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR THE CREATION OF SUBTYPES, WHICH ARE STRUCTURED INTO TWO CATEGORIES. FIRST, FOUR DIMINISHED SUBTYPES OF RECHTSSTAAT ARE DEFINED: INCONSISTENT, ARBITRARY, PARTLY-IMPLEMENTED, AND EXCLUDED. SECOND, THREE DIFFERENT CAUSES FOR THE DEFICIENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED: LACK OF CAPACITIES (LOC TYPE), POWERFUL INTERESTS SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE RULES (PIAR TYPE), AND HIGH ACCEPTANCE OF ALTERNATIVE NORM SYSTEMS (HAAS TYPE). THE LATTER TWO TYPES OF CAUSES, PIAR AND HAAS, ARE LARGELY IGNORED IN LEGAL REFORM STRATEGIES AND YET - ACCORDING TO OUR APPROACH IN THIS ARTICLE - THEY ARE MORE PREVALENT EMPIRICALLY THAN THE FIRST TYPE.
371	DEVELOPING LITERATURE ON LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY U.S. IMMIGRATION RHETORIC HAS FAILED TO ATTEND ADEQUATELY TO THE CHARACTER OF SOVEREIGNTY CLAIMS IN CONTEMPORARY IMMIGRATION POLITICS. THIS ESSAY DEMONSTRATES THE CENTRALITY OF SOVEREIGNTY DISCOURSE BY EXAMINING TEXTS CREATED BY THE STATE, SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC AFFAIRS VIDEOS PRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED BY A REGIONAL MEDIA SERVICES OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE (INS) BETWEEN 1992 AND 2000. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT BORDER IMAGERY FEATURED IN INS MEDIA FUNCTIONS METONYMICALLY AS BOTH A SYMBOL AND AN INDEX OF U.S. SOVEREIGNTY.
372	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL LAW. THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW IN THE CRIMINAL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE ARE INVESTIGATED. IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CRIMINAL LAW OF UKRAINE INCLUDE THE MAIN PROVISIONS ESTABLISHED BY LAW OR DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM IT, PROVIDE A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTENT OF THIS BRANCH OF LAW AND ARE USED IN THE LEGISLATIVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE BODIES. USING DIALECTICAL AND HISTORICAL METHODS, THE GENERAL LAW PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW ARE ANALYZED. THE CONTRADICTION PROBLEMS OF SOME CRIMINAL LAW INSTITUTES WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ARE REVEALED USING THE COMPARATIVE METHOD AND THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS. THE CONCLUSION FOCUSES ON THE NEED TO DEFINE THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES AS A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF CONDUCT OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS AND THE COURT, WHICH PERMEATES ALL STAGES OF THE PROCESS, BASED ON THE PROCEDURAL COERCION OF THE STATE, AND WHICH AIMS TO GUARANTEE OBTAINING SUITABLE AND ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN GENERAL.
373	AMPLE OFFICIAL EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS THE MOST CORRUPT IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. DONALD TRUMP'S OVERALL PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR NOT ONLY RESEMBLED, BUT AMPLIFIED THAT OF MAJOR WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINALS. THIS PAPER HAS TWO MAIN FOCI. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT GOVERNMENT CRIMINALITY AND CORRUPTION WERE FACILITATED BY RATIONALES AND EXCUSES THAT DENIED EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CONDEMNATION OF SUCH ACTS. SECOND, IT CONSIDERS HOW THESE DEFENSES WERE WEAPONIZED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS PART OF A MUCH LARGER AND MORE DELIBERATE "WAR ON WHITE-COLLAR CRIME" MORE GENERALLY. AS A RESULT, ENORMOUS EFFORTS ARE NECESSARY TO RESTORE AND STRENGTHEN REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT REGIMES, AND TRANSCEND DEEPENED POLITICAL CLEAVAGES ON SUCH MATTERS. THROUGH A NEW HYBRID NEUTRALIZATION TECHNIQUE, NORMALIZATION OF CONDEMNING THE CONDEMNERS, TRUMP EXACERBATED EXISTING POLITICAL DIFFERENCES AND INFLUENCED SUPPORTERS TO AT ONCE IGNORE GOVERNMENT CRIME AND CORRUPTION, AND ACCEPT NEW MORAL NARRATIVES THAT FLEW IN THE FACE OF SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF CRIMINALITY.
374	THE TOPIC OF JUSTICE HAS BARELY RECEIVED ATTENTION IN LATIN AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCES. THIS WORK EXAMINES THE RECENT EVOLUTION OF LITERATURE ON THIS ISSUE. PARTICULAR EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON JUDICIAL REFORM AS A NEW PERSPECTIVE OF ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS ON JUDICIAL POLITICS IN MEXICO.
375	IN THIS STUDY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE MEXICAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM IS ANALYZED CONSIDERING THE APPROACHES DERIVED FROM THE WORK OF SERGIO GARCIA RAMIREZ AND LUIS FELIPE GUERRERO AGRIPINO. ON THIS BASIS, SOME QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THE CONDITIONS OF EMERGENCE OF THIS FIGURE ARE ANALYZED, AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS RELATED TO ITS CONCEPTUAL DELIMITATION. ALL THIS WITH A VIEW TO SUSTAINING THAT IT IS AN INSTITUTION THAT WEAKENS THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW AND THE PROJECT OF GUARANTEED CRIMINAL LAW.
376	HIGHLIGHTING A NUMBER OF SHORTCOMINGS IN THE LEGISLATION ON REFERENDUM, THE PRESENT STUDY PROPOSES SOME SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR CORRECTION, USING IN THIS RESPECT THE EXPERIENCE AND GUIDELINES GOVERNING THE MATTER IN DEMOCRATIC STATES. LIKEWISE, IT UNDERLINES THE ADVANTAGES OF PUTTING TOGETHER INTO AN ELECTION CODE BOTH THE ELECTORAL LAW AND THE LAW ON THE ORGANIZATION AND HOLDING OF A REFERENDUM.
377	WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS, VENERATED BY SOME AND REVILED BY OTHERS, WAS VERY MUCH HIS OWN MAN, DISDAINING HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE BENCH AND THE WORK THEY PRODUCED. FOR HIM, THE POINT OF JUDGING WAS SIMPLY TO DO JUSTICE. HOWEVER, JUSTICE IS NOT ALWAYS SELF EVIDENT, AND LEGAL NORMS AND VALUES, LIKE OBJECTIVITY AND STARE DECISIS, ARE IGNORED AT A HIGH COST. NOR, AS IT TURNS OUT, WAS HIS CAREFULLY CARVED AUTHENTIC PERSONA MORE THAN A MASK OF LIES.
378	THE PROBLEMATIC NATURE OF NEOPOPULISM IS OBVIOUS FOR ALL TO SEE. IT IS DIFFICULT THEREFORE TO AVOID AN UNILATERAL AND UNQUESTIONED APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT. IN PARTICULAR, WHAT IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULISM AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. SOME SCHOLARS SUSTAIN THAT NEOPOPULISM COULD SUBVERT THE RULES OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, SOME OTHERS ARE CONVINCED THAT NEOPOPULISM IS CAPABLE TO HAND BACK POWER TO PEOPLE. AN IMPORTANT STARTING POINT FOR A NOT BIASED APPROACH COULD BE REPRESENTED BY ROBERT DAHL'S THEORY OF DEMOCRACY, THAT ALLOWS US TO POINT OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH NEOPOPULISM COULD BECOME A DANGER TO DEMOCRACY OR, ON THE CONTRARY, A CORRECTIVE FOR IT.
379	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE PROCESS OF RE-DEMOCRATIZATION IN BRAZIL THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION OF 1946 AND THE CONSTITUTION OF 1988. BOTH CONSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED A TURNING POINT FROM DICTATORSHIP TO DEMOCRACY TO ESTABLISH A DEMOCRATIC STATE. THE STUDY OF THE MEANING OF ITS LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES IN EACH MOMENT OF HISTORY HELP TO UNDERSTAND AND WORK HARDER TO BUILD A REAL DEMOCRACY IN BRAZIL.
380	THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW INDEX THAT FOCUSES ON CAPTURING THE EXTENT OF DEMOCRACY IN A COUNTRY USING NOT ONLY THE EXISTENCE OF RULES BUT ALSO THE EXTENT OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THE MEASURE, BASED ON THE AXIOMATICALLY ROBUST FRAMEWORK OF (ALKIRE AND FOSTER, J PUBLIC ECON 95:476-487, 2011), IS ABLE TO MODERATE THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRATIC RULES BY THEIR ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. BY DOING THIS WE HAVE A MEANINGFUL WAY OF CAPTURING THE NOTION OF A PARTIAL DEMOCRACY WITHIN A CONTINUUM BETWEEN NON-DEMOCRATIC AND DEMOCRATIC, SEPARATING OUT SITUATIONS WHEN THE RULES EXIST BUT ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED WELL. WE CONSTRUCT OUR INDEX USING V-DEM DATA FROM 1900 TO 2010 FOR OVER 100 COUNTRIES TO MEASURE THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION ACROSS THE WORLD. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WE CAN TRACK THE PROGRESS IN DEMOCRATIZATION, EVEN WHEN THE REGIME REMAINS EITHER A DEMOCRACY OR AN AUTARCHY. THIS IS THE NOTION OF PARTIAL DEMOCRACY THAT OUR IMPLEMENTATION-BASED INDEX MEASURES THROUGH A WIDE-BASED INDEX THAT IS CONSISTENT, REPLICABLE, EXTENDABLE, EASY TO INTERPRET, AND MORE NUANCED IN ITS ABILITY TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRACY.
381	THIS PAPER PURPORTS AN INTERPRETATION OF THE ARISTOTELIAN THEORY OF EQUITY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN ARGUMENTATIVE APPROACH TO LAW. ONCE THE MAIN IDEAS OF THE LEGAL PHILOSOPHY OF ARISTOTLE ARE FRAMED IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS MORAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY (NAMELY, VIRTUE THEORY AND STATE THEORY), THE IMPLICATIONS OF EQUITY FOR THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL REASONING ARE DRAWN IN THE FORM OF TWELVE THESES AGAINST LEGAL FORMALISM.
382	THE AUTHOR BEGAN WORKING IN EASTERN EUROPE IN CONNECTION WITH HIS PROJECT TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF U.S. CONSTITUTIONALISM FOLLOWING THE U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL BICENTENNIAL IN 1987. THIS LED HIM TO ORGANIZE A CONFERENCE ON CONSTITUTIONALISM IN EASTERN EUROPE IN 1990 AND TO COLLABORATE IN PROJECTS ON THE PROGRESS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE REGION SINCE THAT TIME. THE QUESTION THE AUTHOR ADDRESSES IS WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROMISE APPARENT IN 1989 AND FOLLOWING HAS BEEN FULFILLED TWO DECADES LATER.
383	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT REGIME UNDER PRESIDENT ABDEL FATAH SISI HAS ESTABLISHED A MILITARY ELECTORAL AUTHORITARIAN STATE WITH A NON-DOMINANT PARTY ELECTORAL SYSTEM. COUPLED WITH EGYPT'S LONG TRADITION OF NEPOTISM, CRONYISM, AND PATRONAGE NETWORKS, THE NEW ELECTION LAWS PERPETUATE A FRAGMENTED, DEPOLITICIZED PARLIAMENT WHEREIN NO MOBILIZED OPPOSITION CAN TAKE SHAPE TO CHALLENGE THE MILITARY STATE. THE CAUSE OF EGYPT'S CURRENT DEPOLITICIZATION, HOWEVER, IS NOT A WEAK CENTRAL PARTY BEHOLDEN TO THE PRESIDENCYAS WAS THE CASE UNDER SADAT AND MUBARAKBUT RATHER HUNDREDS OF RENT-SEEKING PARLIAMENTARIANS WITH NO PARTY AFFILIATION. SISI INTENTIONALLY STRUCTURED THE PARLIAMENT TO CONSIST OF OVER 400 INDIVIDUAL, SELF-INTERESTED ACTORS VULNERABLE TO BRIBERY OR COERCION TO KEEP THEM DEPOLITICIZED AND COMPLIANT. THIS STRATEGY FACILITATES PURGING ANY PARLIAMENTARY FIGURES WHO EMERGE TO CHALLENGE EXECUTIVE POWER.
384	IN THE MAIN, HAYEK FAVORED RULES THAT APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL AND LOCATED SUCH RULES IN TRADITION, BEYOND CONSCIOUS CONSTRUCTION. THIS LED HAYEK TO ATTACK KEYNES'S IMMORALISM, I.E., THE POSITION THAT ONE SHOULD BE FREE TO CHOOSE HOW TO LEAD ONE'S LIFE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT IMMORALISM MAY BE COMPATIBLE WITH HAYEK'S ENTERPRISE SINCE HAYEK MISINTERPRETED KEYNES, WHO DID NOT ADVOCATE THE DISSOLVING OF ALL INFORMAL RULES FOR EVERYBODY. BY AVOIDING THIS MISINTERPRETATION, IMMORALISM CAN BE SEEN AS INSTITUTIONAL EXPERIMENTATION AT THE MARGIN, WHICH HAYEK HIMSELF FAVORED.
385	AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES SOMETIMES PROFESSIONALIZE THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS TO GOVERN MORE EFFECTIVELY. YET WHEN QUASI-AUTONOMOUS COURTS RULE IN CONTRADICTION TO POPULAR CONCEPTIONS OF RIGHT AND WRONG-POPULAR MORALITY-IT MIGHT THREATEN CITIZENS' TRUST IN THE REGIME. WE USE THE CASE OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THIS "MORAL-LEGAL DILEMMA"-THE COMPETING NEEDS OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE SATISFACTION OF POPULAR JUSTICE CONCERNS. FOUR CASE STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN COURT RULINGS CONFLICT WITH POPULAR MORALITY, THE PARTY-STATE SELECTIVELY ALTERS DECISIONS, SO LONG AS INTERVENTION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY JEOPARDIZE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. TWO ONLINE SURVEY EXPERIMENTS THEN ASSESS CITIZENS' REACTIONS TO MORAL-LEGAL CONFLICT IN COURT RULINGS. WE FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE "MORAL DISSONANCE" WHEN LEGAL DECISIONS CONFLICT WITH POPULAR MORALITY. WE DO NOT FIND THAT MORAL-LEGAL CONFLICT IN COURT RULINGS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERMINES INDIVIDUALS' TRUST IN THE REGIME. OUR ANALYSIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR MORE ATTENTION TO THE MORAL FOUNDATIONS OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE.
386	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE DYNAMICS OF TRANSITIONS AND SECURITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY IN RUSSIA. IT CONSIDERS BOTH THE LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CULTURE IN RUSSIA ON THE BASIS OF THE FORMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CHALLENGES FOUND IN THIS PROCESS. DURING THE THREE PERIODS OF RUSSIAN TRANSITIONS UNDER STUDY IN THIS ARTICLE, ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY HAS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF ATTEMPTS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE NEW IDEALS IN AN OLD ADMINISTRATIVE CULTURE. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT, DURING THESE TRANSITIONS, UNCERTAINTIES AND UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES HAVE INTENSIFIED TRADITIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS THAT HAVE EXCEEDED OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS. AS A RESULT, THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF NEW PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES AND WAYS OF THINKING HAS BEEN DIFFUSE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY REMAINS LEGALISTIC.
387	IN THE 1960S AND EARLY 1970S, TWO POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN CHILE, ONE LED BY EDUARDO FREI AND THE OTHER BY SALVADOR ALLENDE, ACHIEVED REMARKABLE VICTORIES IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. THEY BOTH VOWED TO BRING ABOUT RADICAL CHANGE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW. UNFORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, BOTH ADMINISTRATIONS FAILED TO ACHIEVE THEIR OBJECTIVES. THIS ARTICLE, FOCUSING ON THE 30-YEAR PERIOD THAT PRECEDED THESE TWO ELECTORAL VICTORIES, ARGUES THAT FREI AND ALLENDE'S SEEMINGLY INORDINATE FAITH IN THE VIRTUES AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND STEMMED FROM A PECULIAR FORM OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH IT DESCRIBES AS LEGALITY WITHOUT COURTS.
388	THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO DEFINE THE CONCEPT AND ESSENCE OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF LAW BASED ON THE GENERALIZED ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC, JOURNALISTIC, AND REGULATORY SOURCES. RESULTS. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULES OF LAW IS AN INTELLECTUAL AND VOLITIONAL ACTIVITY OF AN INTERPRETER, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT UNDER THE PRINCIPLES AND BY MEANS OF INTERPRETATIONS AND AIMED AT CLARIFYING AND/OR SPECIFYING THE CONTENT OF THE RULES OF LAW TO UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THEM IN PRACTICE CORRECTLY AND UNIFORMLY. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. IT MAY BE ENSHRINED IN SPECIAL ACTS OF INTERPRETATION, SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL COMMENTARY ON LEGISLATION, DOCTRINAL SOURCES AND OTHER EXTERNAL FORMS OF INTERPRETATION.
389	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS CRITICALLY THE POLITICAL CHALLENGES FACING HONG KONG'S "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" POLICY FOLLOWING THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT AND TO EVALUATE THE TERRITORY'S DEMOCRATIC AND AUTONOMOUS FUTURE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A CRITICAL, CONTEXTUAL, AND ANALYTICAL APPROACH HAS BEEN ADOPTED TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR POST-UMBRELLA MOVEMENT HONG KONG. FINDINGS - THE CONTRADICTIONS EMBEDDED IN THE "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" POLICY HAVE BECOME APPARENT SINCE THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT AROSE AND HONG KONG'S POLITICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FUTURE IS AS PROBLEMATIC AS ITS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN, THOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN HONG KONG AND BEIJING SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE CRITICAL EVALUATION OFFERED BY THIS PAPER IS NO SCIENTIFIC PREDICTION. SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF THIS KIND IS SUGGESTIVE RATHER THAN DEFINITIVE. THE INFORMED DISCUSSION OFFERED BY THIS PAPER WILL HELP READERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES INHERENT IN BEIJING'S "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" POLICY AND THE TORTUOUS PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN HONG KONG. THE CONCLUSION DRAWN IN THE PAPER POINTS TO A POSSIBLE WAY OUT OF THE POLITICAL IMPASSE THAT IS FACING POST-UMBRELLA MOVEMENT HONG KONG. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER IS A PIONEERING STUDY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL CONFLICT BETWEEN BEIJING AND HONG KONG SINCE 1997, THE CONCLUSION OF WHICH MAY HAVE IMPORTANT POLITICAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CHINA AND HONG KONG.
390	DEMOCRACY IN THE PHILIPPINES IS A PARADOX. IT WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY IN THE REGION TO TOPPLE AUTHORITARIAN RULE. SIGNS OF A VIBRANT DEMOCRACY ARE EXTENSIVE: HIGH VOTER TURNOUT, CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEORETICALLY PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY AND SAFEGUARD RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. YET THE FLAWS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ARE ALSO EXTENSIVE: ELITE DOMINANCE, INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESS, AND WIDESPREAD ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE, WHICH SUGGEST TRUE REPRESENTATION IS LARGELY ILLUSORY. CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY HAVE BECOME CENTRAL TO POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THE PHILIPPINES, AS SEEN IN DEBATES ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND THE HOPES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTION OF REFORM CANDIDATE BENIGNO AQUINO III AS PRESIDENT IN 2010. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINES HOW OLIGARCHIC STRUCTURES AND DYSFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS THREATEN THE EMERGENCE OF TRUE DEMOCRACY IN THE PHILIPPINES.
391	AS POLICYMAKERS AND RESEARCHERS FOCUS MORE ON THE QUESTION OF THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THEY HAVE REQUIRED MEASURES OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE TO SET POLICY OR TO CONDUCT ANALYSES. A NUMBER OF MEASURES OF THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE HAVE BEEN CREATED. AMONG THESE ARE THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, WHICH RANK COUNTRIES ON SIX ASPECTS OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE'. CRITICS HAVE FOCUSED ON PROBLEMS OF BIAS OR LACK OF COMPARABILITY THAT RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF THESE INDICATORS. HOWEVER, A MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS THAT OF WHETHER THE INDICATORS HAVE 'CONSTRUCT VALIDITY' - WHETHER THEY MEASURE WHAT THEY PURPORT TO MEASURE. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY OF THE INDICATORS AND RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER RESEARCHERS AND POLICYMAKERS ARE RELYING ON WRONG DATA, RATHER THAN POOR DATA.
392	BETWEEN THE MID-1990S AND THE MID-2010S, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WAS DISTINCTLY OPEN TO THE WESTERN OFFER OF DEMOCRACY-ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. IT COOPERATED WITH A NUMBER OF WESTERN ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW, VILLAGE ELECTIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY, AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN CHINA. WHY DID THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ENGAGE WITH DEMOCRACY PROMOTERS WHO TRIED TO DEVELOP THESE DEMOCRATIC ATTRIBUTES WITHIN CHINA? THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDED TO USE WESTERN AID TO ITS ADVANTAGE. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD LAUNCHED GOVERNANCE REFORMS TO STRENGTHEN ITS REGIME LEGITIMACY, AND CHINESE OFFICIALS FOUND THAT WESTERN DEMOCRACY ASSISTANCE COULD BE USED TO FACILITATE THEIR OWN GOVERNANCE-REFORM PROGRAMS. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE PROCESS OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGIC INTENTION TRANSLATED INTO POLICIES OF SELECTIVE OPENNESS, AND INCLUDES EVIDENCE FROM FIRSTHAND INTERVIEWS, PROPAGANDA MATERIALS, AND RESEARCH BY CHINESE EXPERTS. THE FINDINGS SHOW HOW DEMOCRACY PROMOTERS AND AUTHORITARIAN LEADERS HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF LIMITED DEMOCRATIC REFORM WITHIN NONDEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. EMPIRICALLY, REFLECTING ON THE SO-CALLED GOLDEN YEARS OF CHINA'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WEST SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S SURVIVAL STRATEGY THROUGH AUTHORITARIAN LEGITIMATION.
393	LEGAL POSITIVISTS LIKE H.L.A. HART ASSERT THAT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE MORALITY TO EXIST; IN FACT IT INSISTS ON THE SEPARATION OF LAW AND MORALITY. RELYING ON LON FULLER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES AGAINST THAT PROPOSITION BY SUGGESTING THAT MORALITY IS NECESSARILY PART OF LAW. USING PIERRE BOURDIEU'S THEORY OF FIELD AND CAPITAL, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SOCIAL VALUES ARE INHERENTLY A PART OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE POSITIVIST VIEW OF LAW HAS A DEFICIENT THEORY OF JUSTICE THAT CAN BE USED TO SECURE INJUSTICE AGAINST DISADVANTAGED GROUPS IN SOCIETY. IN THIS WAY, I CONCEPTUALIZE LAW AS A FIELD OF CONTESTATION. THIS VIEW ENABLES THE POSITION THAT THOSE WHO MOBILIZE THE RIGHT MIX OF RESOURCES, SUCH AS ECONOMIC CAPITAL, SOCIAL CAPITAL, CULTURAL CAPITAL, POLITICAL CAPITAL, AND SYMBOLIC CAPITAL, ARE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS OR ADVANCE THEIR INTERESTS. DRAWING ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL DISCRETION, AND STARE DECISIS, THIS WORK ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW SOCIAL FACTORS ARE INEXTRICABLE FROM LAW'S CREATION.
394	THIS ARTICLE IS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE VITAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU, FOCUSING ON A SPECIFIC AND CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW: JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. RECENTLY, THE CJEU STARTED TO USE ARTICLE 19 (1) OF TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION AND ARTICLE 47 OF THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS A BASIS FOR ENFORCING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE MEMBER STATES IN CASES WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN ANY EXPLICIT CROSS-BORDER ELEMENTS. THIS IS HOW SOME PROVISIONS OF THE HEAVILY CRITICIZED REFORM OF THE POLISH JUDICIARY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DECLARED AS CONTRARY TO EU LAW BY THE CJEU. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT ONLY POLAND WHERE JUDGES FACE DIFFICULTIES. THE MAIN SUBJECT OF THIS ARTICLE IS A HUNGARIAN CASE: A PRELIMINARY REFERENCE ISSUED BY A HUNGARIAN JUDGE QUESTIONING HIS OWN INDEPENDENCE. JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT PRIMARILY THREATENED BY EXPLICIT LEGAL PROVISIONS BUT BY THE FACT THAT THE FORMER HEAD OF THE JUDICIARY ADMINISTRATION REGULARLY MISUSED HER COMPETENCE TO INVALIDATE JUDICIAL APPLICATIONS OVER SEVERAL YEARS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE HUNGARIAN PRELIMINARY REFERENCE AND ITS CHANCES IN LIGHT OF THE CJEU'S RECENT, RESPECTIVE CASE LAW, ESPECIALLY THE PRELIMINARY RULING CONCERNING THE POLISH NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY, THE KRS (KRAJOWA RADA SADOWNICTWA) AND THE DISCIPLINARY CHAMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT (JOINED CASES C 585/18, C 624/18 AND C 625/18).
395	GIVEN THE CENTRALITY OF LAW IN THE CREATION, DECISION-MAKING, AND IMPACT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, THE DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSES AMONG SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND THE NECESSITY FOR CHINA TO ARTICULATE ITS REASONS PUBLICLY FOR ITS ACTIONS WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE ROLES THAT CHINA PLAYS WITHIN THE SECURITY COUNCIL ILLUMINATE AND CLARIFY ITS APPROACHES TO THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW LAW SERVES AS A CONSTITUTIONAL-NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THE SECURITY COUNCIL MUST FUNCTION, FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF HOW THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN TURN MAY SERVE AS A LOCUS OF DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSES THAT DELINEATE, INFLUENCE, AND CONSTRAIN ITS MEMBERS' STATE BEHAVIOURS. IT CHALLENGES THE VIEW THAT LAW PLAYS A LIMITED ROLE ON MATTERS OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY BY EXPLORING CHINA'S VOTING BEHAVIOUR IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT IT HAS PROFFERED. IT ALSO DISCUSSES HOW CHINA MAY RESPOND TO A DRAFT SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION AIMED AT ITS CONDUCT OTHER THAN SIMPLY BY VETOING IT, AND HOW IT HAS TAKEN A PROACTIVE ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY THROUGH THE SECURITY COUNCIL.
396	QUESTIONS CONCERNING RES JUDICATA AND LIS PENDENS IN INVESTMENT ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS REMAIN A SUBJECT OF ACADEMIC DISCUSSIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE "TRIPLE IDENTITY TEST". THE NECESSITY OF A MORE COHERENT APPROACH TO THE MATTER IS A PRESSING ISSUE AMIDST THE CRITICISMS OF THE INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. FINDING VIABLE SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT MULTIPLE/PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTRADICTING DECISIONS IS CRUCIAL IN FURTHER STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN INVESTMENT ARBITRATION.
397	THE MANDATE OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) INCLUDES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AND THE PROMOTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS COMPONENTS OF ITS GOAL OF BUILDING AN OPTIMUM WORLD ORDER. BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT AN OPTIMUM WORLD ORDER CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT FIRST SECURING A MINIMUM OF PEACE AND SECURITY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE RUSSIAN ` SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION' AGAINST UKRAINE, WHICH COMMENCED ON 24 FEBRUARY 2022, POSES A GRAVE THREAT TO HUMANITY, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE INVASION ITSELF, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS LAUNCHED BY A NUCLEAR POWER. IT HAS EXPOSED THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE UN SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY. WHILE THE INCOMPLETE AND HENCE INEFFECTIVE UN SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COLD WAR FOR THE FIRST 50 YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE, PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW GEOPOLITICAL STRUGGLES. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE PAST AND PRESENT EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONSTRUCT A NEW WORLD ORDER BASED ON THE LESSONS IT LEARNT FROM TWO WORLD WARS. PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY AND SELF- DETERMINATION, THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF FORCE, AND THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES ARE CORNERSTONES OF THE WORLD ORDER EMBODIED IN THE UN CHARTER. BUT REFORM OF THE COMPOSITION AND PROCEDURES OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL, INCLUDING POTENTIAL JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ITS DECISIONS, ARE CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. GIVEN THE GRAVE IMPACT OF THE UKRAINE CRISIS ON MILLIONS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS IN UKRAINE AND WORLDWIDE, THE WAR SHOULD BE RESOLVED EXPEDITIOUSLY, PLACING THE PLIGHT OF THOSE VICTIMS OVER AND ABOVE THE STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE PARTIES DIRECTLY INVOLVED.
398	THE AUTONOMY OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IS PUT ON THE MOST SEVERE TEST WHEN THEY ARE UNDER ATTACK BY OTHER ORGANS OF THE STATE. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE WESTERN LEGAL TRADITION FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND THE CONCEPTS OF INSTITUTIONS', PATH DEPENDENCE' AND RULE OF LAW'. UNDER THIS PERSPECTIVE, LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE AN AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT WITH CHARACTERISTICS THAT MUST BE EXPLAINED BY THEIR EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS. THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT INSTITUTIONAL THEORY DESERVES CLOSER ATTENTION WHEN STUDYING LAW AND POLITICAL POWER AND TO PLACE MORE THE REFINED NOTIONS OF THE WESTERN LEGAL TRADITION AND THE RULE OF LAW FROM LEGAL RESEARCH INTO THE THEORETICAL APPROACH OF INSTITUTIONAL THEORY. BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN NAZI GERMANY IT SEEKS TO TEST THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF INSTITUTIONAL THEORY TO LEGAL PHENOMENA.
399	THIS ARTICLE IS DEDICATED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WITHIN THE GENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE ECHR IN VARIOUS WAYS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF RESTRICTIONS OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THEIR OWN NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT: 1) THE STATE AND PUBLIC SECURITY OR ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE COUNTRY; 2) THE PREVENTION OF RIOTS OR CRIMES; 3) HEALTH OR MORALS OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF OTHERS; 4) THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY OR TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY; 5) PROTECTING THE REPUTATION OF OTHERS; 6) THE PREVENTION OF DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION; 7) MAINTAINING THE AUTHORITY AND IMPARTIALITY OF JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES. THE RESEARCH DEFINES A COMMON FEATURE OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES' APPLICATION,TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES NECESSARY IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. THE AUTHORS UNDERLINE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THE RESTRICTIONS DISTORT THE ESSENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT FALL UNDER SUCH DEROGATIONS. THE ARTICLE UNDERLINES THAT THE RESTRICTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF ANY STATE AND MODERN SOCIETY. SUCH RESTRICTIONS SHOULD BE OF A LEGAL NATURE AND SHOULD BE IMPOSED ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL INTEREST - NATIONAL SECURITY, LAW AND ORDER, THE PROTECTION OF MORAL NORMS, AND THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF OTHER PERSONS WHEN THE RIGHT OF ANOTHER PERSON IN A LEGITIMATE BALANCE PREVAILS. THE EMERGENCE OF CHALLENGES TO HUMAN RIGHTS DOES NOT NEGATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, AND THEY CONTINUE TO OPERATE, WHICH TESTIFIES TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND GUARANTEES THE INVIOLABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE WHEN RESOLVING SPECIFIC CASES ON HUMAN RIGHTS RESTRICTIONS.
400	THIS ARTICLE BEGINS EXPLAINING THE ARISTOTELIAN REDUCTION OF RHETORIC TO PERSUASION, WHICH CAME TO DETERMINE WESTERN TRADITION UNTIL MODERN TIMES. TO UNDERSTAND ARISTOTLE'S METHODOLOGY THE AUTHOR THEN WANTS TO DISCUSS THE CONCEPT OF ENTHYMEME, THE "RHETORICAL SYLLOGISM," IN ARISTOTLE'S OWN WORDS. IN ORDER TO TRY A REALISTIC CRITIQUE ON THE ARISTOTELIAN RHETORIC, MORE ADEQUATE TO A RHETORIC OF MODERN LAW, THE AUTHOR WILL SUGGEST THREE EPISTEMOLOGICAL POINTS OF DEPARTURE, THREE THESES, AND THE THREE LEVELS OF RHETORIC THAT SUPPORT THEM.
401	IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC OF NORTH MACEDONIA BY DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC ON MARCH 18, 2020, A STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS ESTABLISHED, WHICH IN ADDITION TO INTENSIFIED MEASURES TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, ALSO IMPLIED THE INTRODUCTION OF A SPECIAL LEGAL REGIME WHOSE BASIC CHARACTERISTICS ARE: DEVIATION FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND TAKING OVER BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIMIT BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND TO TAKE INTERVENTION MEASURES BY THE EXECUTIVE POWER IN ECONOMICS, EDUCATION, LABOR RELATIONS, AND OTHER SPHERES OF SOCIAL LIFE. IN THIS REGARD, THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS ACTIVATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PERFORM ITS LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION. UNLIKE OTHER CONSTITUTIONS THAT REGULATE IN MORE DETAIL THE POWERS OF THE GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL, ENACTMENT OF DECREES WITH THE FORCE OF LAW AND OTHER REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE RESTRICTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY, THE CONSTITUTION OF NORTH MACEDONIA DOES NOT CONTAIN SPECIAL PROVISIONS ON THE GOVERNMENT POWERS, EXCEPT ENACTING DECREES WITH THE FORCE OF LAW. DUE TO SUCH A CONSTITUTIONAL GAP, THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER SUCH REGULATIONS REMAIN IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM EVEN AFTER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY CEASES. THE CONSTITUTION OF NORTH MACEDONIA ONLY STIPULATES THAT THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT DECREES WITH THE FORCE OF LAW LASTS UNTIL THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, WHICH IS DECIDED BY THE PARLIAMENT, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE SITUATION WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED NOT BY THE DECISION OF PARLIAMENT BUT BY THE DECISION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. WITH THIS PAPER AUTHORS BY EXPLAINING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A GENERALLY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN STANDARD IN SUCH SITUATIONS, USING: NORMATIVE LEGAL METHOD, COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD, INTENTIONAL, SYSTEMATIC AND OBJECTIVE INTERPRETIVE METHODS, WILL FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE JUDICIAL CONTROL OF DECREES WITH THE FORCE OF LAW BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF NORTH MACEDONIA, IN TERMS OF TO WHAT EXTENT THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY WAS RESPECTED IN THE ADOPTION OF SUCH DECREES WHICH DEROGATED EXISTING LAWS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF CITIZENS.
402	AT THE END OF THE VERSES 44TH, 45TH, AND 47TH OF THE SURAT AL-MAMODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RINGIDA, IT IS SEEN THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY WHAT ALLAH HAS REVEALED ARE DESCRIBED AS UNBELIEVERS, OPPRESSORS, AND FASIQS WITH THE GENERAL EXPRESSION. ESPECIALLY IN VERSE 44TH OF THE SURAH, THE FACT THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY ALLAH'S REVELATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS MISBELIEVERS HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF DEBATE SINCE THE EARLY PERIOD. MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE MUFASSIRS ABOUT WHO ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SCOPE, WHO ARE THE ADDRESSEES OF THE VERSE, WHETHER THE" KUFR" HERE IS BLASPHEMY IN THE FORM OF DENYING ALLAH AND LEAVING THE RELIGION, OR IS IT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF "KUFR". AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD FROM THE INFORMATION IN THE SOURCES REGARDING THE ASBAB AL-NUZUL OF THESE VERSES WERE REVEALED AS THE JEWS DESTROYED THE PROVISIONS SET BY ALLAH IN THE TORAH, CHANGED THEM WITH VARIOUS WAYS, AND DISCRIMINATED BETWEEN PEOPLE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND APPLIED THEM. WITH THE RELEVANT VERSES IN SURAH AL-MAMODIFIER LETTER RIGHT HALF RINGIDA, ALL THESE INJUSTICES, LAWLESSNESS, AND UNFAIRNESS WERE MADE AWAY AND THE JEWS WHO COMMITTED THEM WERE STRONGLY CRITICIZED. IN THIS REGARD, IT IS SEEN THAT SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE REASON FOR THE VERDICT OF THE RELEVANT VERSES AND INTERPRETED THE CHARACTERIZATIONS IN THE VERSE AS INFIDELS, CRUEL, AND FASIQS AS COVERING ONLY THE JEWS WHO COMMITTED THESE ACTS. HOWEVER, EVEN IF THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE RELEVANT VERSES SHOWS THAT THESE VERSES ARE ABOUT THE JEWS, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE SCOPE OF THE VERSE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THEM. BECAUSE BOTH THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MESSAGES OF THE QUR'AN IN GENERAL AND THE FACT THAT THE ADDRESS IN THE VERSES CAME IN A PUBLIC WAY DO NOT ALLOW THESE PROVISIONS TO BE ALLOCATED ONLY TO A CERTAIN GROUP. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF ISTINBAT, THE FACT THAT THE REASON FOR MAKING A RELIGIOUS PROVISION IS SPECIFIC DOES NOT PREVENT THE GENERALIZATION OF IT. WHEN CONSIDERED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PRINCIPLES WE HAVE EXPLAINED, IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT NARROWING DOWN THE PROVISIONS OF THE VERSES BY ALLOCATING THEM ONLY TO A CERTAIN GROUP IS NOT A CORRECT APPROACH. IN THIS ARTICLE, IT IS AIMED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE RICHNESS OF MEANING THAT EMERGES WHEN THE RELEVANT VERSES ARE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF INDICATIONS IN THE FIQH METHOD. WHEN THE VERSES WITHIN OUR SUBJECT ARE EVALUATED IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF INDICATIONS, IT IS SEEN THAT THESE VERSES INDICATE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROVISION IN FORCE CANNOT BE AVOIDED. IN THE RELEVANT VERSES, IT'S CONCLUDED THAT IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF LAW SUCH AS THE REALIZATION OF JUSTICE, THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, NO ONE'S BEING PRIVILEGED IN THE SIGHT OF THE LAW, THE POWERS OF THE HEAD OF STATE ARE LIMITED, THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR IJTIHAD WHERE ALLAH'S CLEAR JUDGMENT EXISTS.
403	THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT THE CONTEMPORARY MANIFESTATIONS OF RIGHT-WING POPULISM IN EUROPE OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD, AT LEAST IN PART, AS REACTIONS TO A DISTINCTIVE FORM OF POSTWAR EUROPEAN SOCIETY, WHICH I WILL CALL HERE EMBEDDED CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE POPULIST REACTION TO EMBEDDED CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY GENERALLY TAKES A CONSERVATIVE FORM. THIS CONSERVATISM IS EXPRESSED IN RATHER DIFFERENT WAYS (RANGING FROM ETHNORELIGIOUS VIEWS TO 'ILLIBERAL LIBERAL' ONES), BUT AT THE SAME TIME POPULISM DISPLAYS A SHARED CORE OF CRITICISMS ON LIBERALISM, AND IN PARTICULAR REGARDING THE INTERNATIONALIZED OR GLOBAL VERSION OF LIBERALISM. IN THE ARTICLE, I WILL START WITH A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE EMERGENCE OF POSTWAR SOCIETY IN THE FORM OF EMBEDDED CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, USED AS A BACKCLOTH FOR THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL VIEWS OF LIBERAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE LAW IN CONSERVATIVE POPULIST THINKING. I WILL, THEN, FOCUS ON POPULISTS' CRITICAL VIEWS OF LIBERALISM AND 'GLOBALISM', ANALYZED IN THE FORM OF CONTEMPORARY ARTICULATIONS OF (CONSERVATIVE) POPULISM IN BOTH EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE (HUNGARY AND POLAND), AND WESTERN EUROPE (FRANCE, ITALY, THE NETHERLANDS). IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITIES AND CRITICAL POSITIONS, I DISCUSS FOUR THEMES: ABSTRACTNESS AND INAUTHENTICITY, IDENTITY THREAT, DOMINATION, AND LEGAL FUNDAMENTALISM.
404	THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) IS AN INTERNATIONAL COURT OPERATING IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. ITS JUDGMENTS ARE NOT GIVEN DIRECT EFFECT IN NATIONAL LAW. IN THIS SENSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF LEGAL PLURALISM BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW. BUT THE ECTHR HAS CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS IN NATIONAL LAW THROUGH THE WEIGHT PLACED ON THE COURT'S PRACTICE BY NATIONAL COURTS. THEREFORE, CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ARE APPLICABLE IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ECTHR AND NATIONAL COURTS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE TRANSNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE COURT, AND HOW THIS SHOULD GUIDE THE ROLES OF, RESPECTIVELY, THE ECTHR AND NATIONAL COURTS.
405	REGARDING POLITICAL OBLIGATION, THE THEORY OF FAIR PLAY STATES THAT, IF A PERSON WHO IS PART OF AN ADVANTAGEOUS COOPERATIVE SCHEME BENEFITS FROM THE EFFORTS OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS, HE HAS TO BEAR THE BURDENS OF COOPERATION; OTHERWISE, HE WOULD VIOLATE HIS DUTY OF FAIR PLAY, THAT IS, TO RECIPROCATE THE BENEFITS OBTAINED. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, THE POLITICAL OBLIGATION HAS A PRIMA FACIE CHARACTERISTIC, WHICH ALLOWS THE POSSIBILITY OF THINKING ABOUT FORMS OF JUSTIFIED DISOBEDIENCE AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR LAW OR GOVERNMENTAL ACT. THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WELL-KNOWN ARE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, PROTEST AND CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION.
406	SOUTH AFRICA'S INVOCATION OF ITS DISASTER MANAGEMENT ACT IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONA VIRUS, COVID-19, PRESENTS A CLEAR JUNCTURE IN ITS CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE WAYS IN WHICH POWER FUNCTIONS AND THE DYNAMICS AND SIGNIFICATION IT CONVEYS ARE CENTRAL TO HOW THE STATE IS COMMANDED AND HOW LAW IS COMMUNICATED. UNDER THE STATE OF DISASTER, AN ABNORMALITY ASSUMES DOMINANCE. THE TECHNIQUES OF POWER THAT ARE MANDATED UNDER THE ACT CHARGES THE EXECUTIVE TO DIRECTLY CONFRONT COVID-19, THE NAMED ENEMY AND SCAPEGOAT. THE PRESENCE OF BOTH THE NORMATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND AN EXCEPTION, FOLLOWING CARL SCHMITT, CREATES AN UNEASY SYNTHESIS. IT REQUIRES THE EXECUTIVE TO CLAIM AUTHORITY. YET, WITH THE ACT INVOKED IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTION AND THEREBY THE PEOPLE REMAINING SOVEREIGN, EXECUTIVE POWER REMAINS STUNTED. THIS STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICA'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 HIGHLIGHTS THE UNRESOLVED TENSIONS PRESENT WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES DECLARE EMERGENCIES. THE DISASTER SEES SOUTH AFRICA ENTER A SITUATION WHEREBY IT IS CONFRONTED WITH UNPRECEDENTED LEGAL AND POLITICAL CHALLENGES. ITS RESPONSE CONJURES EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS REGARDING ITS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AND LEGAL STRUCTURES.
407	THIS ARTICLE IS PART OF THE LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION OF THE MEXICAN STATE, THE MOST RECENT OF ITS EXPRESSIONS WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF MEXICO CITY, WHOSE PREVIOUS VALIDITY AN INTEGRATION OF THE CONSTITUENT POWER, TRANSGRESSES THE DOCTRINAL FORMALISMS TO SUCH EFFECT. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT IT IS A REGULATORY LAW OF THE SUPREME STANDARD, WHOSE ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF INCLUSION AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PLACES IT AS A CATALYST DOCUMENT OF THE CLAIMS OF A SOCIETY AT RISK. LIKEWISE, WE SHOW THE INCONSISTENCIES IN ONE OF ITS CHAPTERS THAT ENGENDERS ALL THE THEORETICAL DISCUSSION ON JUSTICE AND SECURITY. IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES ARE CONCATENATED TO IUS NATURALISM TO BE DECLARATIVELY A LOCAL CONSTITUTION OF ADVANCED WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO MAINTAIN THE KANTIAN PRINCIPLE THAT MUST GOVERN EVERY HUMAN BEING; THEIR INSTRUMENTATION IS CONTRASTED WITH THE DAILY REALITY OF THE INHABITANTS TO GIVE RISE TO THE HELLERIAN IDEA OF NORMALITY AND NORMATIVITY. THE JUDICIARY AND ITS INTEGRATION INTO THIS CONSTITUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GAPS GIVING RISE TO WHAT FUELS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY. IN THIS FRAMEWORK OUR REFLECTION IS MOLDED TO STRUCTURE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THIS REGULATION UNDER THE KELSENIAN PYRAMID.
408	CORRUPTION IS A PHENOMENON THAT HAS RECEIVED GLOBAL ATTENTION FROM ACADEMICS, POLICY MAKERS AND INTERNATIONAL DONORS. CORRUPTION MAY BE DEFINED AS THE ABUSE OF POWER FOR PRIVATE GAIN. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE BRIBERY, EXTORTION, RENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR, CRONYISM, PATRONAGE, NEPOTISM, EMBEZZLEMENT, GRAFT AND ENGAGEMENT WITH CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. HOWEVER, PATRONAGE, NEPOTISM AND GIFT GIVING ARE FREQUENTLY VIEWED IN MANY ASIAN AND AFRICAN CULTURES AS ACCEPTABLE PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE EFFICIENCY AND SMOOTH RELATIONSHIPS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THESE PRACTICES IN CONTEXTS INCLUDING AFGHANISTAN, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, RUSSIA, CHINA AND SOUTH ASIA, DISCUSSES VARIOUS RATIONALES FOR THESE PRACTICES, AND SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PRACTICES CAN BE RECONCILED WITH INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE IMPLICATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ANTICORRUPTION PROTOCOL TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (APUNCAC) AND THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A BODY OF UNITED NATIONS (UN) INSPECTORS TO INVESTIGATE CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AND REFER CASES TO DEDICATED DOMESTIC ANTICORRUPTION COURTS. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT UN INSPECTORS AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS AGAINST CORRUPTION ARE NOT INCOMPATIBLE WITH TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PRACTICES. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS UPON THE EXPERIENCES OF HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE, WHERE CORRUPTION WAS ENDEMIC, TO DEMONSTRATE THAT LOCAL CULTURAL NORMS CAN BE RAPIDLY CHANGED WHEN INDEPENDENT INSPECTORS ARE ESTABLISHED AND RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FREE FROM MANIPULATION BY DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES.
409	WHAT DOES ADOPTING AN AUSTRALIAN IDENTITY MEAN? THIS IS A PERSONAL JOURNEY, AS WE COME FROM A CATALAN BACKGROUND. IT IS A REFLECTION ON CONTEMPORARY MELBOURNE LIFE, PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO IMMIGRATION WAVES AND WAYS OF LIFE IN OUR NEW COUNTRY. HOWEVER, TO INTEGRATE EXPERIENCES AND EVERYDAY MEMORIES INTO A GENERAL FRAMEWORK, WE WILL OFFER A PRELIMINARY COMPARATIVE SCHEME BETWEEN BOTH CULTURES. WE WILL EXPLORE THE SYSTEM OF CULTURAL REPRODUCTION, DIFFERENTIAL MULTICULTURALITY, THE EMERGENCE OF POLITICAL RIGHTS, AND THE INSTITUTIONAL CREATION OF CULTURAL AND POLITICAL IDENTITIES IN BOTH COUNTRIES.
410	A NUMBER OF THE STUDIES ON INTERNATIONAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS) RULE OUT THAT THEY ARE AUTONOMOUS OR CAPABLE OF SELF-DIRECTING THEIR PROCESSES OF CHANGE. THE CASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA (CICIG) MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SEE PRECISELY TO WHAT DEGREE AN IO IS AUTONOMOUS. THROUGH DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF CICIG, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE ORGANIZATION ADJUSTED AND REINTERPRETED ITS MANDATE AS A RESULT OF A PROCESS OF INTERNAL AND AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS. THIS EVIDENCE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE ABOUT THE IOS AS SELF-DIRECTED ACTORS.
411	THE MEDIA HOOP-LA ABOUT EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS OBSCURED A LESS FLASHY YET MORE VITAL - AND PHILOSOPHICALLY RELEVANT - PART OF THE STORY, NAMELY THE MORAL AND POLITICAL SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH HE ACTED TO MAKE THE HITHERTO COVERT SCOPE AND SCALE OF NSA SURVEILLANCE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE. HERE I ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD INTERPRET SNOWDEN'S ACTIONS AS MEETING MOST OF THE DEMANDING TESTS OUTLINED IN SOPHISTICATED POLITICAL THINKING ABOUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. LIKE THOREAU, GANDHI, KING AND COUNTLESS OTHER (FORGOTTEN) GRASS-ROOTS ACTIVISTS, SNOWDEN HAS IN FACT ARTICULATED A POWERFUL DEFENSE OF WHY HE WAS MORALLY OBLIGATED TO ENGAGE IN POLITICALLY MOTIVATED LAW-BREAKING. HE HAS ALSO UNDERTAKEN IMPRESSIVE EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN HOW HIS ACTIONS ARE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM ORDINARY CRIMINALITY, AND WHY THEY NEED NOT CULMINATE IN RECKLESS LAWLESSNESS. IN FACT, HIS EXAMPLE CAN PERHAPS HELP US ADVANCE LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC IDEAS ABOUT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. FIRST, IT HIGHLIGHTS SOUND REASONS WHY, PACE THE ORTHODOX VIEW, THE ACCEPTANCE OF PUNISHMENT BY THOSE ENGAGING IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS A PRECONDITION OF ITS LEGITIMACY. SECOND, SNOWDEN REMINDS US THAT OURS IS AN ERA IN WHICH INTENSIFIED GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES DIRECTLY SHAPE EVERY FEATURE OF POLITICAL EXISTENCE. DEFENDERS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE NEED TO UPDATE THEIR REFLECTIONS ACCORDINGLY.
412	THE ONGOING DEBATE IN POLAND REGARDING THAT COUNTRY'S SOVEREIGNTY AND ITS MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ITS ROOTS IN PART IN THE PERIOD OF TRANSFOR-MATION THAT FOLLOWED THE FALL OF COMMUNISM IN 1989, DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THE NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY PLAYED INTO IT. HOWEVER, THE NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY ONLY EMERGED WITH POLAND'S ACCESSION TO THE EU IN 2004. IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIRST PERIOD OF POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL CASE LAW CONCERNING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE EU AND RECENT CASE LAW, MARKED BY A SUPPOSED CONFLICT AT THE LEVEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS. THIS LAST APPROACH IS NOT CONVINCING BUT CAN ONLY BE QUESTIONED AFTER THE RESTORATION OF NOR-MALITY IN THE POLISH JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS.
413	THIS PAPER AIMS TO SHOW THE MODIFICATIONS OPERATED TO THE CLASSIC FORMULATION OF SOVEREIGNTY AS A RESULT OF ITS ADJUSTMENT TO THE NEW PARADIGM OF THE DEMOCRATIC AND CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF. IN THE END, IT ANALYZES THE NOTION OF SHARED SOVEREIGNTY IN ARGENTINA AND THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND INTERNATIONAL.
414	MY MAIN CONCERN IN THIS PAPER IS TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE JUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO THE EXECUTIVE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CAMEROON. I PORTRAY HOW AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRY PURPOSELY FAIL TO INVEST THE JUDICIARY WITH SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE. IN SO DOING, I LOOK AT THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE DOMINEERING EXECUTIVE ENTITY AND THE PREVAILING HOBBESIAN CONCEPTION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS ACCORDING TO WHICH POWERS MUTUALLY DIVIDED DESTROY EACH OTHER. MY INVESTIGATION REVOLVES AROUND THE IDEA AS TO KNOW WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE POLITICAL INTRUSION AND INTERFERENCE TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE WHEN SUCH INTRUSION AND INTERFERENCE HAVE BECOME INHERENT AND CONSUBSTANTIAL TO THE MODUS OPERANDI OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM ITSELF. VARIOUS STUDIES ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE AVAILABLE BUT THE PECULIARITY OF THE CURRENT ONE IS NOT ABOUT THE EXTENT OR LIMITATION TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BUT IT QUESTIONS WHETHER THIS INDEPENDENCE EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE STUDY FURTHER INNOVATES BY PROVIDING A THEORY BASED APPROACH WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE JUDICIAL MOTIVATIONS AS WELL AS THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE EROSION OF THE LIBERAL POLITICAL THEORY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CAMEROON.
415	THIS CREATIVE PIECE COMBINES NON-FICTION, POETRY AND FICTION TO IMAGINE THE VOICES OF A REFUGEE, A MARKET VENDOR, A SOLDIER AND A DISSIDENT ADDRESSING THE QUESTION OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN MYANMAR. DRAWING PRIMARILY FROM MY EXPERIENCES WORKING WITH BURMESE LAWYERS AND REFUGEES ON THE THAILAND-MYANMAR BORDER, THE PIECE FIRST PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE EFFORTS IN MYANMAR, AND THEN SHIFTS TO VOICES INSPIRED BY PEOPLE WHOM I MET ALONG THE WAY - IN REFUGEE CAMPS, SELLING VEGETABLES, RECOVERING FROM PRISON. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE TOO OFTEN IGNORES THESE QUIETER VOICES. THE VOICES THAT I ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE, HOWEVER, ARE FRUSTRATINGLY UNHELPFUL, FREQUENTLY EVASIVE AND LARGELY AMBIVALENT ABOUT JUSTICE. I EXPECTED PASSIONATE CONDEMNATION OF PAST WRONGS AND OUTRAGE AT GOVERNMENT ABUSE. THE QUIETER VOICES DEFIED MY EXPECTATIONS. THE POETRY AND VIGNETTES, THEREFORE, REFLECT A MORE NUANCED, LYRICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT PARTIALLY SURRENDERS TO THE PASSING OF TIME AND THE POWERLESSNESS THAT PEOPLE FEEL IN THE FACE OF DISTANT AUTHORITY.
416	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS A CLASSICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES, THE SETS, ACCORDING TO THE LAW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EXECUTIVES AND INDEPENDENT REGULATIONS. THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THE PRESENT AND VALIDITY OF THIS CLASSIFICATION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF OUR TIME, ANALYZING THE PROBLEMS, POINTING OUT ITS MAJOR BANKRUPTCIES, AND ESTABLISHING CRITERIA AND PROPOSALS FOR PROGRESS IN THE REFORM OF THIS CONSTRUCTION. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE APPLICATION OF THIS CLASSIFICATION WITH LOCAL REGULATIONS, WHICH HAS ITS OWN CHARACTERISTICS.
417	THE PAPER IDENTIFIES DEFICIENCIES IN EXISTING CONCEPTS OF "SOCSIAL STATE". A RETROSPECTIVE OF FORMING THE CONCEPT AND ITS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION IS OFFERED AND ITS CRITERIA ARE ANALYZED. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE SOCIAL STATE IS A COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL, IDEOLOGY-DRIVEN DESIGN. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS HIS OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM.
418	THE ARTICLE, PART OF A WIDER RESEARCH ON "LAW WITHOUT POLITICS" - CONCERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE REGULATION ACTIVITY OF THE INDEPENDENT ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES -, ANALYSES THE REGULATION POWERS OF THE ANTICORRUPTION AUTHORITY (ANAC) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CARRYING OUT OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS LAW (D.LGS. N. 50/2016). IT FOCUSES ESPECIALLY ON THE "GUIDELINES" OF THE ANAC AND THEIR POSITION IN THE SYSTEM OF THE SOURCES OF LAW: IN FACT, THESE PRESENT NORMATIVE CHARACTERS, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE MADE BY A NON-REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTION.
419	THE GENERAL TENDENCY FOR POST-COMMUNIST STATES HAS BEEN TO ADOPT STRONG OR 'THICK' CONSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE KIND OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION WHICH WILL ACHIEVE STRONG CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAS CHOSEN TO ADOPT A STRONG PRESIDENTIAL REGIME TOGETHER WITH A POTENTIALLY 'THICK' CONSTITUTION WHICH GIVES FAR-REACHING HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND CONSTITUTIONALIZATION POSSIBILITIES. THE RESULT IS A RATHER THIN CONSTITUTION, BUT WHICH AT PRESENT SEEMS TO CONFORM TO THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE RUSSIAN STATE.
420	THE WORK OF THE MID-VICTORIAN JURIST, AV DICEY, HAS HAD A REMARKABLE INFLUENCE ON BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL THOUGHT, NOT LEAST IN ESTABLISHING THE ORTHODOX FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYERS CONTINUE TO WORK. THAT LEGAL POSITIVIST FRAMEWORK HAS, HOWEVER, RECENTLY BEEN CHALLENGED BY JURISTS ADVOCATING WHAT IS GENERALLY CALLED COMMON LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM. ACCEPTING THE CORE OF SENSE IN DICEY'S ACCOUNT, THEIR OBJECTIVE HAS BEEN TO REVISE SOME OF THE JURISPRUDENTIAL UNDERPINNINGS OF HIS FRAMEWORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF SHOWING THAT THE DOMINANT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BRITISH SYSTEM IS NOT SOVEREIGNTY BUT LEGALITY. MARK WALTERS NOW BUILDS ON THIS REVISIONARY WORK BY OFFERING A NEW HISTORICALLY INFORMED STUDY OF DICEY'S LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THE ORTHODOX INTERPRETATION OF DICEY AS A LEGAL POSITIVIST IS ITSELF MISCONCEIVED. WALTERS ARGUES THAT, PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD, DICEY HAD A MORE NUANCED APPRECIATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOVEREIGNTY AND LEGALITY THAN IS COMMONLY APPRECIATED. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE EXAMINES WALTERS'S EXERCISE AND ASSESSES ITS CONTEMPORARY SIGNIFICANCE.
421	MANY STUDIES ON INTERNATIONAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS) RULE OUT THERE BEING AUTONOMOUS OR CAPABLE OF SELF-DIRECTING THEIR PROCESSES OF CHANGE. THE CASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA (CICIG) MAKES IT POSSIBLE PRECISELY TO OBSERVE TO WHAT DEGREE AN TO IS AUTONOMOUS. THROUGH DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS AND INTERVIEWS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CICIG, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE ORGANIZATION ADJUSTED AND REINTERPRETED ITS MANDATE AS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS OF INTERNAL AND AUTONOMOUS DECISIONS. THIS EVIDENCE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE ABOUT IOS AS SELF-DIRECTED ACTORS.
422	THE POLISH PEOPLE REMAIN STAUNCHLY IN FAVOUR OF THE CONCEPT OF A EUROPEAN UNION. PARADOXICALLY THOUGH, THERE HAS BEEN STRONG AND CONTINUED ELECTORAL SUPPORT FOR LAW AND JUSTICE (PIS), ITS RULING PARTY, DESPITE ITS INSISTENCE ON PRECIPITATING AND THEN CONTINUING MULTIFACETED CONFLICTS WITH EU INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INTERNAL STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN POLAND AND THE ATTITUDES TO THE EU OF POLAND'S LEADERS; THE ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT THOSE ATTITUDES HAVE DEEPENED PRE-EXISTING DIVISIONS OVER INTEGRATION. BY FUSING THE TRIPLE MODERNIZATION THEORY OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION WITH A TWO-DIMENSIONAL CONCEPT OF PARTY-BASED EUROSCEPTICISM, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW PIS'S AMBIGUOUS DISCOURSE ON EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, COMBINED WITH AN INCREASINGLY INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH TO THE EU BY THE POLISH ELECTORATE-AND THAT ELECTORATE'S DEEPENING POLARIZATION-HAVE SECURED STEADY SUPPORT FOR PIS FROM OSTENSIBLY EUROPHILE VOTERS.
423	THE MOST IMPORTANT PROMISE OF THE LEGACY OF LEGAL REALISM IS ITS ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF LAW, WHICH IS IRREDUCIBLE TO ONE OR ANOTHER MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR JURISPRUDENTIAL SCHOOL, AS A SET OF INSTITUTIONS DISTINGUISHED BY THE DIFFICULT ACCOMMODATION OF THREE CONSTITUTIVE YET IRRESOLVABLE TENSIONS: BETWEEN POWER AND REASON, BETWEEN SCIENCE AND CRAFT, AND BETWEEN TRADITION AND PROGRESS. THIS ARTICLE DEFENDS THIS VIEW THROUGH A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF BRIAN LEITER'S AMBITIOUS AND PROVOCATIVE ACCOUNT OF LEGAL REALISM, WHOSE LEGACY HE DESCRIBES AS NATURALISED JURISPRUDENCE. I ARGUE THAT LEITER UNDERSTATES THE REALIST INDETERMINACY CRITIQUE OF PEDIGREED SOURCES, MISSES THE REALIST DISTINCTION BETWEEN DOCTRINE (OR PEDIGREED SOURCES) AND LAW, AND ERRS IN CLASSIFYING LEGAL REALISTS AS TACIT HARD POSITIVISTS. BY STUDYING THESE MISTAKES AND REFINING HIS NATURALISTIC CLAIMS, I REVEAL WHY LEITER MUST ALSO BE INCORRECT IN REDUCING LEGAL REALISM TO A DESCRIPTIVE THEORY OF ADJUDICATION. LEITER'S ACCOUNT OBSCURES THE REAL LEGACY OF LEGAL REALISM.
424	A SIMPLE ENDOGENOUS GROWTH MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO CHARACTERIZE CREDIT RATIONING THROUGH THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROCESS. THE MODEL SHOWS THAT CREDIT RATIONING ON INVESTMENT LOANS DECREASES AS CAPITAL ACCUMULATES AND THE ENFORCEMENT COST DECREASES. WE FIND THAT THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTEREST RATE FACTOR (LENDING INTEREST RATE/DEPOSITING INTEREST RATE) HAS A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE CREDIT RATIONING PROBABILITY. HOWEVER, SIMULATIONS SHOW THAT THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTEREST RATE SPREAD THROUGH THE CAPITAL ACCUMULATION PROCESS DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE OF THE ENFORCEMENT COST. IN THE EMPIRICAL PART OF THE PAPER, WE CONSIDER FIFTY-TWO COUNTRIES, AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, OVER THE PERIOD 1995-2005. WE CONFIRM THE THEORETICAL FINDINGS RELATIVE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTEREST RATE SPREAD AND INTEREST RATE FACTOR WITH CAPITAL ACCUMULATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, FOR ECONOMIES ENDOWED WITH COSTLY CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, THE INTEREST RATE FACTOR COULD BE A BETTER PROXY OF CREDIT RATIONING THAN THE INTEREST RATE SPREAD.

425	AT PRESENT, COUNTRIES FROM EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND OTHER REGIONS TRY TO ACCOMPLISH, AT THE SAME TIME, BUT WITH DIFFERENT DEGREE OF SUCCESS, BOTH DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN SOME CASES, ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAS BEEN BLOCKED OR HAS ALREADY CEASED TO HAVE ANY PRIORITIES, WHICH IMPLIES A GREAT HINDRANCE FOR DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER IS FOCUSED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN LATIN AMERICA, FROM THE SECOND HALF OF THE 90S UP TO THE CURRENT TIMES, STARTING FROM A RETROSPECTIVE EXERCISE ON THAT CONTEXT IN PAST TIMES. IT HAS BEEN, ESPECIALLY FOCUSED ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHILE, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, PERU, COSTA RICA, AND BRAZIL, WHERE ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAS BEEN INCREASING; ALSO, ON THOSE WHERE IT HAS EXPERIENCED A NOTABLE DESCENT: VENEZUELA, ECUADOR, BOLIVIA, NICARAGUA, AND ARGENTINA.
426	THE PRESENT WORK ANALYSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICS AND MORALITY IN DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY OF JURGEN HABERMAS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRESUPPOSITIONS OF THIS POLITICAL THEORY. UNLIKE WHAT THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHER CURRENTLY RAISES, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE RECONSTRUCTIVE SENSE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC THEORY ALLOWS TO JUSTIFY SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BY MAKING EXPLICIT THE NORMATIVE-MORALS PRESUPPOSITIONS ALWAYS RECOGNIZED IN INTERSUBJECTIVE PROCEDURES OF RATIONAL DELIBERATION THAT SUCH THEORY ESTABLISHES. AS A RESULT OF THIS ARGUMENTATIVE STRATEGY IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE PHILOSOPHER MUST COMMIT HIMSELF TO RECOGNIZE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE CONCEPT OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY WOULD BE RADICALLY ALTERED.
427	ON 3RD NOVEMBER 2007 GENERAL PARVEZ MUSHARRAF IMPOSED A STATE OF EMERGENCY ON PAKISTAN. DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THE JUDICIARY WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN, THE MEDIA SELECTIVELY CENSORED AND MANY LAWYERS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WERE ARRESTED. WHILE THE LOWER CLASSES REMAINED RELATIVELY SILENT AND CARRIED ON WITH THEIR DAILY ROUTINES, AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVEMENT AGAINST MUSHARRAF, BUT MORE SO PRO-DEMOCRACY AND PRO-JUDICIARY, SWEPT THE COUNTRY. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE POLITICAL CONCERNS OF A SPECIFIC (UPPER-MIDDLE CLASS) CLASS SUBCULTURE, THE EXTRAORDINARY MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROTEST. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROTEST WAS ORGANISED AND NEGOTIATED WAS PROFOUNDLY ROOTED IN CLASS DIVISIONS AFFECTING CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN THE FIELD OF NEW MEDIA, AND THAT WHERE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN NEW AND OLD MEDIA OCCURRED, THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SIGNIFICANTLY INVOLVE OTHER CLASSES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW META-MEDIATIC OUTPUTS AND PRODUCTIONS AIMED PRIMARILY AT A FOREIGN AUDIENCE NEVERTHELESS HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE PAKISTANI PUBLIC SPHERE, ALTHOUGH IT CONFUTES THEORIES THAT NEW MEDIA CAN PRODUCE SOCIAL CHANGE AT A GREAT SPEED. THE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, MONITORING OF INTERNET BLOGS AND VIDEOS, COLLECTION OF ARTICLES IN THE ENGLISH PRESS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE PROTEST.
428	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A COMPARATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY OF APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THIS FACTOR IS TRADITIONALLY USED BY THE EU AND THE WEST TO CRITICIZE THE POLICIES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, COMBINING PRESSURE AND ENCOURAGEMENT IN ORDER TO WESTERNIZE THEM. TO ACCEPT AND PRACTICALLYL IMPLEMENT THE WESTERN CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, MODERN CHINA, HAVING CARRIED OUT RAPID SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND SCIENTIFIC-TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, NOT ONLY DID NOT CHANGE ITS POLITICAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO BEGAN TO REFORM THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING. IDEOLOGICAL INERTIA AND SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PROBLEM DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING IN EUROPE HOW, WHILE RETAINING THE SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY, CHINA BECAME THE SECOND ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, ACQUIRING GLOBAL PRIMACY AND PROMOTING ITS MODEL, WITHOUT SETTING, LIKE THE WEST, SPECIAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES, AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, INCLUDING THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH HAVE A HISTORICAL, DYNAMIC CHARACTER, AND A VERY DIVERSE IMPLEMENTATION. IN THE SOCIO-PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE, THE COMPETITION BETWEEN THE CONSTRUCTIVIST AND FUNCTIONAL APPROACHES IN THE FORMS OF THE LIBERAL-BOURGEOIS AND SOCIALIST SYSTEMS IS DEVELOPING BETWEEN THE EU AND THE PRC.
429	THE US IS NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL FORCE ON THE WORLD SCENE CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR PROTECTIONS AS A MEANS OF 'HUMANIZING' THE ONGOING GLOBALIZATION OF THE CAPITALIST ECONOMY. THIS PAPER RAISES CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE US ADVOCACY OF TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR STANDARDS AND NORMS BY CRITICALLY EXAMINING THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF US TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR PROTECTIONS. BY MEANS OF A SURVEY OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR PROTECTIONS PRESENTLY ENDORSED BY THE US, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THEIR INTERNAL LEGAL WEAKNESSES - IN PARTICULAR, THEIR FAILURE TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE MINIMAL RUDIMENTS OF MODERN FORMAL LEGALITY - RENDER THEM AT BEST INEFFECTIVE AND AT WORST AN INSTRUMENT FOR ATTEMPTS TO ASSURE THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC HEGEMONY OF THE US, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE PARTS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH THE US HAS TRADITIONALLY PLAYED A DOMINANT ROLE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNDERSTANDABLE APPEAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR STANDARDS, THE US MODEL OF TRANSNATIONAL LABOUR PROTECTIONS REPRESENTS A FALSE HUMANITARIANISM WHICH THUS FAR HAS BORN FEW FRUITS FOR LABOUR EITHER IN THE US OR ABROAD.
430	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE PART PLAYED BY COLLECTIVE MEMORY IN THE CURRENT THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND. THE STARTING POINT IS THE CONCEPT OF COMMEMORATIVE LAWMAKING AND A CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF THE USE OF THE CONCEPT OF MEMORY LAWS IN RECENT SCHOLARSHIP. AN ANALYSIS OF FRAMING OPERATIONS PERFORMED BY PIS MEMORY POLITICS OFFERS EXAMPLES OF HOW THE NOTION OF COMMEMORATIVE LAWMAKING CAN BE DEPLOYED IN ORDER TO EXPLORE TECHNIQUES OF LEGAL GOVERNANCE OF MEMORY, INCLUDING BRICOLAGE (ILLUSTRATED BY THE CASE OF POLISH CONSTITUTION OF 1997), RETOUCH (EXEMPLIFIED BY RECENT REFORM OF POLISH JUDICIARY) AND RE-STYLIZATION (ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACT ON NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF REMEMBRANCE OF 2018). THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH AN EXPLORATION OF THE INTRINSIC CONNECTION BETWEEN THE THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND AND MEMORY POLITICS OF THE CURRENT POLISH GOVERNMENT, ACCOMPANIED BY A DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF LAW AND MEMORY STUDIES.
431	THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE RELATION BETWEEN TORTURE AND LAW. IT DEALS WITH ITS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE RELATED CONCEPTUAL TENSIONS. PROCEEDING FROM THE RECENT DEBATE ON THE LEGITIMACY OF TORTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SO-CALLED WAR ON TERROR, THE PAPER CONSIDERS RELEVANT ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE RELEGALIZING SOLUTION. IT FINALLY ATTEMPTS A CRITICAL STRATEGY THAT POINTS OUT WHAT IN THE END IS THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM: THE CONCEPT OF LAW.
432	GENERALLY SPEAKING, ONE COULD THINK THAT MARKET AND DECENTRALIZATION ARE COMPATIBLE AND, THEREFORE, SO ARE DECENTRALIZATION AND NEOLIBERALISM. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN DECENTRALIZATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH (NEO) LIBERALISM, THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT IS A DISCOURSE COMING FROM, FOR EXAMPLE, MILTON FRIEDMAN OR RONALD REAGAN. THIS ESSAY ATTEMPTS TO SHOW THAT (NEO) LIBERAL DISCOURSE CAME NOT ONLY FROM THE SO-CALLED LIBERTARIAN THINKERS, IT ALSO CAME FROM TRADITIONALIST CONSERVATIVES (NASH, 1987[1976]) LED BY RICHARD WEAWER, PETER VIERECK, RUSSEL KIRK, FRAN MEYER AND BARRY GOLDWATER. THEREFORE, SUCCESS OF THE (NEO) LIBERALISM PROPOSAL IN DECENTRALIZATION MATTERS REQUIRED: 1) THE CONVERGENCE OF LIBERTARIANISM AND TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT; 2) THAT TRADITIONAL CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT DEMONSTRATE THAT CONTEMPORARY CONSERVATIVISM IS CONSTITUTIONALIST. THUS, THE ( NEO) LIBERAL IDEA IS FORMED BY THE TRIUMVIRATE OF CONSTITUTION-DECENTRALIZATION (STATES' RIGHTS)-MARKET ECONOMY.
433	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF OPORTUNIDADES, MEXICO'S CONDITIONAL CASH TRANFERS PROGRAM, ON REPORTING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN TO THE POLICE. I USE SPECIALIZED SURVEY DATA TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL REPORTS TO THE POLICE FOR POOR WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED SPOUSAL ABUSE PRIOR TO PARTICIPATING IN OPORTUNIDADES. THE IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY FOR THIS PAPER CONSISTS OF TWO INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES THAT ARE BASED ON INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OPORTUNIDADES: I) DROP OUT VARIATION CAUSED BY THE TYPE OF HOSPITAL AVAILABLE IN ANY GIVEN LOCALITY (E.G. FEDERAL VERSUS STATE-RUN) AND II) THE ROLL-OUT IN THE DENSIFICATION PROCESS. FINDINGS INDICATE AN INCREASE OF 30.2% IN THE REPORTING RATES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RECEIVING OPORTUNIDADES. I PROPOSE SEVERAL CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH TREATMENT MIGHT WORK INTO THE FINAL OUTCOME: I) ASSIMILATION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS; II) AN INCREASE OF TRUST IN THE POLICE; AND III) A NEW EQUILIBRIUM IN THE MARRIAGE MARKET IN WHICH MORE FUTURE DISSOLUTIONS AND FEWER RECONCILIATIONS OCCUR AMONG ABUSED BENEFICIARY WOMEN.

434	THIS PAPER DEFINES A 'CRISIS OF SOVEREIGNTY' IN RELATION TO THE STATUS OF LEGAL AUTHORITY WITHOUT THE NATIONSTATE AS AN ULTIMATE REFERENT. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF A DEBATE BETWEEN TWO INFLUENTIAL STRANDS OF LEGAL THEORY KNOWN AS LEGAL POSITIVISM AND NATURAL LAW, IT SUGGESTS ONE CURRENT FORM OF RESPONSE IS A RENEWAL IN NATURAL LAW THEORY, WHICH DE-EMPHASISES THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS IN FAVOUR OF THE IDEA OF THE COMMON GOOD OF A POLITICAL COMMUNITY. THROUGH REFERENCE TO THE ARISTOTELIAN CONCEPTS OF POLITICS AND NATURE THAT ARE OFTEN INVOKED IN THESE THEORIES, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPT OF LAW IN NEW NATURAL ACCOUNTS, WHILE MANIFESTLY FOUNDED ON RATIONAL PRINCIPLES, STILL RETAINS A THEOLOGICAL CORE.
435	BASED ON INTERDISCIPLINARY AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, ESPECIALY OF CONCRETE EXPERIENCES IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PUBLIC POLICY FOR ARMED POLICE ACTION IN BRAZIL.
436	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE STATUS OF FOREIGN PRECEDENTS IN NATIONAL COURTS. IT EXAMINES POSSIBLE REASONS FOR COURTS REFERRING TO THEM AND CONCLUDES THAT, ABSENT SOME INCORPORATING CONVENTION, JUDGES CANNOT EVER BE SAID TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REFER TO THEM. BUT IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THERE IS NOTHING UNPRINCIPLED ABOUT NATIONAL COURTS CHOOSING TO TREAT FOREIGN PRECEDENTS AS PERSUASIVE AUTHORITY, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THERE ARE SOME GOOD REASONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION, FOR CAUTIONING AGAINST THIS. IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT NO SATISFACTORY ARGUMENT CAN BE ADDUCED TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION THAT A NATIONAL COURT MUST NEVER RELY ON FOREIGN PRECEDENT AS THE SOLE REASON FOR MODIFYING THE INDIGENOUS COMMON LAW - THOUGH IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY THAT JUDGES WOULD EVER NEED (STILL LESS WANT) TO RELY ON FOREIGN PRECEDENT IN THIS WAY.
437	I ARGUE THAT PROCESS AND SUBSTANCE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THE PUBLIC LAW FORM AND THAT THE FORM CONDITIONS THE CONTENT OF THE LAW. THE REDUCTION OF A POLITICAL PROGRAMME TO THE EXPLICIT TERMS OF A STATUTE INVOLVES A CONVERSION OF POLICY INTO PUBLIC STANDARDS, WHICH PRODUCES A KIND OF LEGAL SURPLUS VALUE. IT BRINGS INTO BEING A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PUBLIC STANDARD - ONE THAT PERMITS THE OPERATION OF THE PRINCIPLES IDENTIFIED BY LON L. FULLER AS THE DESIDERATA OF THE INNER MORALITY OF LAW, AND WHICH ENABLES INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS OF RIGHT BASED ON LEGAL PRINCIPLE TO BE ADJUDICATED.
438	NEOREPUBLICANISM MAY BE DEFINED AS THE ATTEMPT BY CURRENT POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, PHILOSOPHER'S, HISTORIANS, LAWYERS, AND OTHERS TO DRAW OIL A CLASSICAL REPUBLICAN TRADITION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ILL ATTRACTIVE PUBLIC PHILOSOPHY INTENDED FOR CONTEMPORARY PURPOSES. THREE MAIN IDEAS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY PROMINENT IN THE NEOREPUBLICAN LITERATURE. FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT IS THE CONCEPTION OF A FREE PERSON AS ONE WHO DOES NOT LIVE TINDER THE ARBITRARY WILL OR DOMINATION OF OTHERS. SECOND IS THE ASSOCIATED CONCEPTION OF A FREE STATE AS ONE THAT ATTEMPTS TO PROMOTE THE FREEDOM OF ITS CITIZENS WITHOUT ITSELF COMING TO DOMINATION THEM. AND THIRD IS THE CONCEPTION OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP AS CONSISTING IN A VIGILANT COMMITMENT TO PRESERVING THE STATE IN ITS DISTINCTIVE ROLE AS AN UNDOMINATING PROTECTOR AGAINST DOMINATION. THE AIM OF THE NEOREPUBLICAN RESEARCH PROGRAM IS TO RETHINK ISSUES OF LEGITIMACY AND DEMOCRACY, WELFARE AND JUSTICE, PUBLIC POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, FROM WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK THAT THESE BASIC IDEAS PROVIDE.
439	ENFORCEMENT IS CRITICAL TO GUARANTEE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS FOR NATURE CONSERVATION. ERRONEOUSLY ASSUMING AN EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THE FORMAL IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION ON PAPER AND ITS PRACTICAL ENFORCEMENT IN REALITY CAN RESULT IN BIASED CONCLUSIONS WITH POTENTIAL TO ILL-INFORM CONSERVATION ACTIONS AND INFLUENCE STAKEHOLDER PERCEPTIONS. HERE, USING AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EUROPEAN SANITARY REGULATIONS EC 1069/2009 AND EU 142/2011 TO MANAGE LIVESTOCK CARCASSES FOR WILDLIFE CONSERVATION IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THE LEGAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE REGULATIONS DOES NOT MEAN EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IN PRACTICE. WHEN INTERVIEWED, MORE PORTUGUESE FARMERS DECLARED TO LEAVE CARCASSES IN THE FIELD WITHOUT OFFICIAL AUTHORIZATION, THAN THEIR SPANISH COUNTERPARTS, WHO WERE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO SO. THIS UNFORESEEN RESULT WAS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY GPS-TRACKED VULTURES FEEDING ON LIVESTOCK CARCASSES AVAILABLE IN THE PORTUGUESE COUNTRYSIDE, CONTRASTING TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED CONSIDERING THE SANITARY REGULATIONS APPROVED AT EACH COUNTRY AT THE TIME OF THIS STUDY. ACCORDINGLY, WHILE AGREEING WITH THE GLOBAL TREND FOR WEAK ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION, OUR RESULTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AGAINST ASSUMING THAT THE FORMAL IMPLEMENTATION ON PAPER OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS EQUALS THEIR REAL IMPLEMENTATION ON THE GROUND. WE HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS (NOT ASSUME) OBSERVANCE OF AND COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AND PROPOSE SOME WAYS TO IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT USING AS AN EXAMPLE THE ABOVE REFERRED SANITARY REGULATIONS. COMMUNICATION-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO PUBLICIZE THE REGULATIONS, REDUCING BUREAUCRATIC BURDEN, AND ON-GROUND MONITORING TO ASSESS OBSERVANCE AND COMPLIANCE HAVE STRONG POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE ENFORCEMENT. OVERLOOKING IMPLEMENTATION GAPS CAN GIVE RISE TO BIASED INTERPRETATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE LEGAL TOOLS WITH CONSEQUENCES AT BOTH, THE SCIENTIFIC AND CONSERVATION ARENAS.
440	THE WORK STARTS WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF REHABILITATION AND THE PROHIBITION OF INHUMAN TREATMENTS WHICH STEM FROM THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION (ARTICLE 27, THIRD PARAGRAPH) AND THE PRISON ACT (LAW NO. 354/1975). STARTING FROM A STUDY OF STATUTORY LAW AND ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION THE PAPER PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE "INFRA-PENALTIES" IN THE ITALIAN CRIMINAL SYSTEM IN ORDER TO BRING OUT CRITICAL POINTS AND QUESTIONABLE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION.
441	SINCE ITS CREATION IN AUGUST 2003, THE INDONESIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S DECISIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON INDONESIAN POLITICS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT NGOS HAVE HAD A CRUCIAL AND UNDERAPPRECIATED ROLE IN DETERMINING BOTH WHICH CASES REACH THE JUSTICES, AS WELL AS THE CONTENT OF THE COURT'S FINAL DECISIONS. BASED ON AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF CASES ADJUDICATED BETWEEN AUGUST 2003 AND OCTOBER 2013, IT FINDS THAT NGOS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THE MAJORITY OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS CLAIMS, RESULTING IN SOME OF THE COURT'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND FAR-REACHING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, THE JUSTICES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO QUOTE PETITIONS SUBMITTED BY NGOS, MEANING THAT INFORMATION NGOS INCLUDE IN THEIR BRIEFS SHAPES THE JUSTICES' UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES AT STAKE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS HAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE INFLUENCE OVER INDONESIAN POLITICS AND POLICY THAN IS COMMONLY RECOGNIZED.
442	THE OBJECT OF PROTECTION OF LABOUR LAW IS THE EMPLOYEES WAGE. THE TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE MODE OF PROVIDING PERSONAL SERVICES HAVE REDUCED THEIR RANGE AND EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PROTECTION HAVE ENCOUNTERED WITH FLEXIBILIZATION PROCESSES AND THE INCREASING OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THIRD PARTIES AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT,WHETHER IN ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE OR IN NO SUBORDINATION OF ANY KIND. TWO TYPES OF WORK OUTSIDE THE OBJECT OF PROTECTION OF LABOR LAW ARE VOLUNTARY WORK AND UNPAID WORK AT HOME. THE CHALLENGES OF PROTECTION INVOLVE GIVING VALUE TO ALL KINDS OF WORK, WHICH IMPLICATES REFORMULATING LABOUR LAW AND SOCIAL SECURITY BASIC PRINCIPLES.
443	FOLLOWING THE DISPUTED 2007 KENYAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF VIOLENCE ERUPTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY ADDING TO THE HISTORY OF TROUBLED ELECTIONS IN AFRICA. THIS PAPER OFFERS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE ON THE ISSUES THAT TRIGGERED THE ELECTORAL VIOLENCE, ITS INCIDENCE, AND IMPACTS. USING TWO SURVEYS CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION WE FIND THAT ONE OUT OF THREE KENYANS WAS AFFECTED BY THE VIOLENCE REGARDLESS OF THEIR ETHNICITY AND WEALTH. THE CHANCES OF BEING A VICTIM OF VIOLENCE WERE HIGHER IN AREAS WITH LAND CONFLICTS AND WHERE POLITICALLY-CONNECTED GANGS OPERATED. VIOLENCE, WHICH WAS MAINLY TRIGGERED BY THE PERCEPTION THAT THE ELECTION HAD BEEN RIGGED, INCREASED SUPPORT TOWARD LAWLESSNESS, REDUCED TRUST AND SOCIAL CAPITAL AMONG COMMUNITIES.

444	IT IS OFTEN HELD THAT PLANNING THEORY HAS LITTLE INFLUENCE ON PLANNING PRACTICE. SOME SPEAK OF AN EVIDENT 'THEORY-PRACTICE GAP'. IN REALITY, THE OPPOSITE SEEMS TO BE THE CASE. THE SO-CALLED 'THEORY-PRACTICE GAP' IS NOT THE MAIN ISSUE AT ALL; THE REAL QUESTION IS 'WHICH THEORY FOR WHAT KIND OF PRACTICE'? ASSUMING THIS VIEW, THE ARTICLE PRESENTS TWO DIFFERENT THEORIES OF PUBLIC REGULATION: THE TELEOCRATIC APPROACH AND THE NOMOCRATIC APPROACH. THEY CAN BE INTERPRETED AS GENERAL APPROACHES REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE STATE, BUT THE ARTICLE FOCUS PARTICULARLY ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACCEPTING THEM IN THE SPECIFIC FIELD OF LAND-USE REGULATION. FOR THE TELEOCRATIC APPROACH, PLANNING MUST BE THE CENTRAL AND MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF LAND-USE REGULATION, WHILE FOR THE NOMOCRATIC APPROACH PLANNING HAS ONLY A SECONDARY ROLE AND DIFFERENT KIND OF REGULATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPOSED.
445	THIS RESEARCH PAPER HAS AS MAIN OBJECTIVE TO ANALYZE THE TRANSITION FROM A CRISIS OF LEGAL POSITIVISM TO THE RULE OF THE PRINCIPLES IN THE STAGE AT THE NEW LAW. IN ORDER TO DO SO, WE STATE - HYPOTHETICALLY- THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NATURAL LAW ENOUGH REASONS HAS BEEN DEFINED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE THE RULE OF THE NEW LAW. IN REGARD TO VALIDATE THIS VIEW, THE PRESENT PAPER IS BASED UPON A BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESIGN, WHICH IS ALSO EPISTEMOLOGICALLY SUPPORTED IN A HERMENEUTIC HISTORICAL STUDY, SINCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS OF LEGAL POSITIVISM TO THE RULE OF THE PRINCIPLES IN THE NEW LAW, WITHOUT ANY PROFOUND INTERPRETATION OF CHARACTERISTICS, ELEMENTS AND CRITERIA THEY CONTAIN.
446	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE PROCESS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE LAW 9/2008, APPROVED BY THE BASQUE PARLIAMENT IN JUNE OF 2007, ABOUT SUMMONS AND REGULATION OF A POPULAR CONSULTATION IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PUBLIC OPINION IN THE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BAEQUE COUNTRY ABOUT THE DECISION OF OPENNING A NEGOTIATION PROCESS TO REACH THE PEACE AND THE POLITICAL NORMALIZATION.
447	CONSTITUTIONAL DISMEMBERMENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN CONSEQUENCES ATTACHED TO CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT ALBERT'S BOOK ANALYSES. AFTER HAVING ANALYZED ALBERT'S DEFINITION, THE PRESENT ESSAY FOCUSES ON THE PRACTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DISMEMBERMENT VIA REFERENDUM AND DISCUSSES WHETHER, IN TIMES OF POPULISM AND DEMOCRATIC DECAY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN SHOULD PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC MEASURES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE POLITICAL OPPOSITION FROM THE ALLEGIANCE BETWEEN THE POPULIST LEADERSHIP AND THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. BUILDING ON THE EXISTING LITERATURE AND ON A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING THE PROS AND CONS OF INTRODUCING SPECIAL PROTECTIONS FOR POLITICAL MINORITIES DURING CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDA TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY AGAINST POPULIST DEVIATIONS, SUGGESTING THE NEED TO PROVIDE FURTHER STUDIES IN THIS FIELD.
448	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A READING OF THE PAINTING NATIVE DIGNITY (1860) BY ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN ARTIST S T GILL. IN TREATING THE PAINTING FIRST AS AN ARTEFACT, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW A DISCOURSE OF DIGNITY IS EMBEDDED IN IT, IN A WAY THAT REGISTERS ITS CONSTITUENT UNDERSTANDINGS, ANXIETIES, AND CONTRADICTIONS. THE RESULT IS A GENEALOGY OF 'NATIVE DIGNITY' THAT TRACES ITS MOVEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA - A MOVEMENT THAT REVEALS ITS TERRIBLE COST FOR ABORIGINAL PEOPLES. WHILE THE PRICE OF 'NATIVE DIGNITY' MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN APPARENT IN EUROPE, IN THE SEARING ANTIPODAL LIGHT IT BECAME ALL TOO CLEAR THAT THE CONCEPT, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD THE DIGNITY OF ALL HUMANS, UPHELD ONLY THE DIGNITY OF EUROPEAN MAN; THAT THIS SUPPOSEDLY NATURAL PROPERTY REMAINED AN ARTIFICIAL ONE THAT ABORIGINAL PEOPLES COULD POSSESS ONLY IF REMADE IN THE IMAGE OF THE EUROPEAN. IF THAT IS WHAT THE PAINTING REVEALS WHEN ANALYSED AS AN ARTEFACT, THEN JUST AS IMPORTANT IS WHAT IT REVEALS WHEN SEEN AS AN ARTWORK. HERE THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE CONTRADICTION THAT LINGERED IN 'NATIVE DIGNITY' WAS INNERVATED BY THE PAINTING - HOW NATIVE DIGNITY CONFRONTED ITS EUROPEAN AUDIENCES WITH NERVE-FORCE, REVEALING LIKE A HARLEQUIN IN A PUBLIC SQUARE THE UNDERBELLY OF EUROPEAN MAN'S NATIVE DIGNITY.
449	WHICH INTERPRETIVE TASKS SHOULD BE DELEGATED TO MACHINES? THIS QUESTION HAS BECOME A FOCAL POINT OF "TECH GOVERNANCE" DEBATES. ONE FAMILIAR ANSWER IS THAT WHILE MACHINES ARE CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING TASKS WHOSE ENDS ARE UNCONTROVERSIAL, MACHINE DELEGATION IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR TASKS THAT ELUDE HUMAN CONSENSUS. AFTER ALL, IF HUMAN EXPERTS CANNOT AGREE ABOUT THE NATURE OF A TASK, WHAT HOPE IS THERE FOR MACHINES? HERE, WE TURN THIS POSITION AROUND. WHEN HUMANS DISAGREE ABOUT THE NATURE OF A TASK, THAT SHOULD BE PRIMA FACIE GROUNDS FOR MACHINE DELEGATION, NOT AGAINST IT. THE REASON HAS TO DO WITH FAIRNESS: AFFECTED PARTIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF PARTICULAR CASES. INDETERMINATE DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENTS-THOSE IN WHICH HUMAN DISAGREE ABOUT ENDS-ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE IN THAT, FOR ANY GIVEN CASE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIKELY OUTCOMES WILL DEPEND ON A SPECIFIC DECISION MAKER'S VIEW OF THE RELEVANT END. THIS INJECTS AN IRREDUCIBLE DYNAMIC OF RANDOMIZATION INTO THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NON-REPEAT PLAYERS. TO THE EXTENT MACHINE DECISIONS AGGREGATE ACROSS DISPARATE VIEWS OF A TASK'S RELEVANT ENDS, THEY PROMISE IMPROVEMENT ON THIS SPECIFIC DIMENSION OF PREDICTABILITY. WHATEVER THE OTHER VIRTUES AND DRAWBACKS OF MACHINE DECISION-MAKING, THIS GAIN SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND FACTORED INTO GOVERNANCE. THE ESSAY HAS TWO PARTS. IN THE FIRST, WE DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DETERMINACY AND CERTAINTY AS EPISTEMIC PROPERTIES AND FASHIONING A TAXONOMY OF DECISION TYPES. IN THE SECOND PART, WE BRING THE FORMAL POINT ALIVE THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF CRIMINAL SENTENCING.
450	THIS ARTICLE IS INSCRIBED WITHIN LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION OF THE MEXICAN STATE, THE MOST RECENT OF ITS EXPRESSIONS WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF MEXICO CITY, WHOSE VALIDITY PRIOR TO AN INTEGRATION OF THE CONSTITUENT POWER VIOLATES THE DOCTRINAL FORMALITIES FOR SUCH EFFECT. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT IT IS A REGULATORY LAW OF THE SUPREME NORM, WHOSE PROGRESS IN TERMS OF INCLUSION AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PLACES IT AS A CATALYST DOCUMENT FOR THE CLAIMS OF A SOCIETY AT RISK. LIKEWISE, WE SHOW THE INCONSISTENCIES IN ONE OF ITS CHAPTERS THAT ENGENDERS THE ENTIRE THEORETICAL DISCUSSION ON JUSTICE AND SECURITY. IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES ARE CONCATENATED WITH JUS NATURALISM TO BE DECLARATIVELY NAMED AN ADVANCED LOCAL CONSTITUTION, WHOSE AIM IS TO MAINTAIN THE KANTIAN PRINCIPLE THAT SHOULD GOVERN ALL HUMAN BEINGS; ITS INSTRUMENTATION IS CONTRASTED WITH THE DAILY REALITY OF THE INHABITANTS TO EMERGE THE HELLERIAN IDEA OF NORMALITY AND NORMATIVITY. THE JUDICIARY AND ITS INTEGRATION IN THIS CONSTITUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GAPS THAT GAVE RISE TO WHAT FUELS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROVERSY. OUR REFLECTION IS MOLDED IN THIS FRAMEWORK TO STRUCTURE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF THIS REGULATION UNDER THE KELSENIAN PYRAMID.
451	BOTH CARL SCHMITT AND GIORGIO AGAMBEN DRAW ON THE ANCIENT GREEK CONCEPT OF NOMOS AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT UNDERPINNING THEIR LEGAL THEORIES. AIMING TO RESTORE THAT CONCEPT TO ITS PRE-SOPHISTIC MEANING, THEY GRANT CENTRAL WEIGHT TO A PIECE OF POETRY IN WHICH PINDAR FAMOUSLY PROCLAIMS THAT 'LAW (NOMOS) IS KING OF ALL', GUIDING BOTH MORTALS AND IMMORTALS WHILE 'JUSTIFYING THE UTMOST VIOLENCE WITH A POWERFUL HAND'. FOR SCHMITT AS FOR AGAMBEN, THIS MEANS THAT THE PINDARIC FRAGMENT EXPOSES THE VIOLENT ORIGINS OF LAW THAT NORMATIVIST JURISPRUDENCE TYPICALLY SHIELDS FROM VIEW. FOR ONE THING, I WILL EXPLAIN IN THIS ARTICLE WHY SCHMITT'S AND AGAMBEN'S USE OF THE FRAGMENT IS AT ODDS WITH ANY ACCEPTABLE INTERPRETATION OF IT IN ITS WIDER LITERARY AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, PERHAPS, MY AIM IS ULTIMATELY TO RECONSTRUCT A PINDARIC JURISPRUDENCE AS IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE PREFERRED TO THAT OF BOTH SCHMITT AND AGAMBEN.
452	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE ISSUE - LARGELY NEGLECTED IN THE TRANSITION LITERATURE - OF THE RELATIVE WEIGHTS OF THE PRIVATIZED SECTOR AND THE GENERIC PRIVATE SECTOR (OF DE NOVO PRIVATE FIRMS) IN THE EMERGING PRIVATE SECTOR OF POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION. THE PRESENT WRITER POSITS THAT THE RELATIVE WEIGHT OF EACH IN THE AGGREGATE SHARE OF A PRIVATE SECTOR (GENERALLY EXPANDING OVER TIME AS TRANSITION PROGRESSES) STRONGLY INFLUENCES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, BOTH DURING CORRECTIONAL RECESSION AND DURING RECOVERY AND EXPANSION PERIOD. ANOTHER, INTERRELATED ISSUE CONSIDERED HERE IS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE EVOLVING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND THE EXPANSION OF THE GENERIC PRIVATE SECTOR, THAT IS THE MOST DYNAMIC ONE IN THE TRANSITION ECONOMY. IT IS TRUE THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN A STAPLE OF A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS, ARTICLES, AND PAPERS. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE CONCENTRATES ON ONE COMPONENT OF A PRIVATE SECTOR ONLY, THAT IS THE GENERIC PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT LOOKS BEYOND THE 'HOLY TRINITY' OF TRANSITION (STABILIZATION, LIBERALIZATION, AND PRIVATIZATION) TOWARDS A WIDER INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF POLITICAL LIBERTY, LAW AND ORDER. THE FOREGOING WIDER FRAMEWORK, AND THE EMERGING GENERAL TRUST, MATTERS AS MUCH - IF NOT MORE - FOR THE PRESENT WRITER AS THE STANDARD TRANSITION PROGRAM. IT IS THE RELATIVE DYNAMICS OF BOTH COMPONENTS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AFFECTED BY BOTH STANDARD TRANSITION PROGRAMS AND THE ABOVE-MENTIONED WIDER INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, THAT IS OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE FOR THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION. IN THE LAST PART OF THE ARTICLE I WILL TRY ALSO TO ANSWER, TENTATIVELY, THE QUESTION UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES THE WIDER INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK MAY EMERGE IN THE TRANSITION PROCESS.

453	LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE TRANSITION TO A LOW-CARBON SOCIETY. AFTER EXPLAINING UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXPECTATIONS ARE LEGITIMATE, THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THOSE EXPECTATIONS WHOSE FRUSTRATION UNDERMINES THE ABILITY TO PLAN, INFRINGES BASIC MORAL RIGHTS, OR IS EXTREMELY COSTLY FOR ITS BEARER MIGHT JUSTIFY A DEVIATION IN THE BASELINE OF JUSTICE IN FAVOUR OF THE EXPECTATION HOLDER. PEOPLE SHOULD BE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE LIKELY FRUSTRATION OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID THE FRUSTRATION OF THEIR EXPECTATIONS, ADAPT THEIR LIFE PLANS AND MINIMISE COSTS. SINCE THE FRUSTRATION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE IN THE TRANSFORMATION TO A LOW-CARBON SOCIETY, PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE PROTECTION OF THE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE WHO CANNOT BE MATERIALLY COMPENSATED. STILL, IF TWO GROUPS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MATERIAL COMPENSATION, WE SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY TO PROTECTING THE EXPECTATION OF THOSE WHO CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THE SAME LIFE PLAN AS BEFORE IF THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE FRUSTRATED.
454	THE DRAFT ANTICORRUPTION PROTOCOL TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (APUNCAC) SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT AGGRESSIVE MEASURES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION AND IMPUNITY, INCLUDING UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS WHO WOULD CONDUCT INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AND HAND CASES TO DEDICATED DOMESTIC ANTICORRUPTION COURTS. APUNCAC IS DESIGNED TO BE A FREE-STANDING PROPOSAL. HOWEVER, IT COULD BE COMBINED WITH JUDGE MARK WOLF'S PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION COURT (IACC). AN ADVANTAGE OF COMBINING IACC + APUNCAC IS THAT THE COMBINATION DEFUSES THE KEY ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE IACC. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT LEADERS OF NATIONS THAT CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE ENDEMIC CORRUPTION MIGHT FIND IT POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT TO ADOPT THE PROPOSED REFORMS. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES OF COMBINING IACC + APUNCAC. THE COMBINATION WOULD ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT CORPS OF ELITE INVESTIGATORS, ENDOW THEM WITH STRONG POWERS TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND ENABLE THEM TO REFER CASES TO DEDICATED ANTICORRUPTION COURTS STAFFED BY JUDGES VETTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON CRIME PREVENTION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. APUNCAC ESTABLISHES MECHANISMS TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY OF JUDGES SERVING DEDICATED ANTICORRUPTION COURTS. BY ADDRESSING THE KEY ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE IACC, THE PROPOSAL TO COMBINE IACC + APUNCAC MAY ENABLE BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT IN NATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC SUPPORT IN ORDER TO SECURE RATIFICATION.
455	THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY OF THE DISCIPLINE ADOPTED IN ITALY TO DEAL WITH THE COVID-19 EMERGENCY MUST BE EVALUATE ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND REASONABLENESS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO ASSESSMENTS IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO OBJECT TO. THE EVOLUTION OF THE SAID DISCIPLINE HIGHLIGHTS HOW LEGALITY AND OPPORTUNITY HAVE BOTH PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GOVERNMENT CHOICES.
456	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE DECISION BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL IN UGARTECHE WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT PERUVIAN CONSTITUTION AND PERU'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. OF SPECIAL INTEREST ARE THE ARGUMENTS OF THE COURT THAT IT IS NOT UP TO A CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATOR TO REDEFINE THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE BECAUSE THAT ATTRIBUTION RESTS WITH THE LEGISLATOR OR WITH THE POWER TO INTRODUCE A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM.
457	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE CONSISTS ON MAKING AN ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENCE OF THE KIND OF STATE ON THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THEREFOR IN THE FIRST PART THE CONCEPT OF STATE OF LAWS IS USED WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HISTORICAL AND NEW CONSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED UN THE LAST YEARS. THE SECOND SECTION STUDIES THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE COLOMBIAN LAW PARADIGM AND ITS ENSHRINNING IN A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, ITS CONSEQUENCES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATEMENT AND THE NECESSITY TO REALICE A SPECIFIC STUDY OF THE SUBJECT.
458	IN THE POSTCOMMUNIST COUNTRIES' CANDIDATE TO THE EUROPEAN MEMBERSHIP, THE EU AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE EXERCISED A HEAVY PRESSURE ON DOMESTIC ELITE TO PROMOTE THE ADOPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND JUDICIAL CAPACITY. RELYING ON A WIDE SET OF INTERVIEWS WITH THE KEY ACTORS OF THE EUROPEAN AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS, THIS ARTICLE WILL DISCUSS THE LOGIC OF ACTION OF THE JUDICIAL REFORMS ADOPTED IN POLAND, CZECH REPUBLIC, AND HUNGARY IN TWO POLICY SUBFIELDS: THE GOVERNANCE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE GOVERNANCE OF THE COURT. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT THE PROCESSES OF REFORM HAVE BEEN DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY THE NATIONAL ACTORS WHO HAD BEEN EMPOWERED DURING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE EU.
459	THE ARTICLE LOOKS FOR EXPLANATIONS FOR THE OVERTHROWS OF THREE ECUADORIAN PRESIDENTS, WHICH HAVE MARKED THE CULMINATING POINTS OF A DECADE OF INSTABILITY. IT ANALYSES INTO THE FIELD OF THE SOCIAL MOBILIZATIONS THAT PRECEDED EACH ONE OF THOSE FACTS, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ITS SOCIAL COMPOSITION AND THE OBJECTIVES OF ITS MEMBERS. IN THE FINAL PART, SOME HYPOTHESES ARE SET OUT ABOUT THE MOBILIZATION AGAINST GUTIERREZ' GOVERNMENT. IT SUGGESTS THAT EXPLANATIONS OF RACISM AND CLASISM ARE NOT VALID. RATHER, IT CONNECTS THE EXPLANATION TO THE SPROUTING OF DEMOCRATIC VINDICATIONS ORIGINATED SO MUCH IN THE LOW YIELDS OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM LIKE IN THE DICTATORIAL CHARACTER OF THE LAST GOVERNMENT.
460	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE INTERRELATION OF OUTER APPEARANCE AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF MODERN CHINESE COURT BUILDINGS WITH THE PARTY-STATE'S STRATEGY OF BUILDING REGIME LEGITIMACY. THE SPATIAL ELEMENT OF THIS RELATION IS EXPLORED IN FOUR DIFFERENT COURT BUILDINGS IN KUNMING, CHONGQING, SHANGHAI AND XI'AN. IT IS ARGUED THAT COURT BUILDINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMPOWERMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WHO APPEAR AS PARTIES IN TRIALS. COURTHOUSES ALSO FACILITATE THE COURTS' FUNCTION OF EXERCISING SOCIAL CONTROL AND THE APPLICATION OF AN INSTRUMENTALIST APPROACH TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC TRIALS. BOTH THE GROUNDING OF COURT BUILDINGS IN THE PAST AND THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL MODELS OF A MODERN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY ARE ASPECTS OF CONSOLIDATING REGIME LEGITIMACY.
461	OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS OR SO, THE WORLD BANK HAS EXPANDED ITS RULE OF LAW AGENDA BY MOVING INTO THE AREA OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THIS TURN TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, HOWEVER OBVIOUS IT MAY BE FROM A DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE, WAS - AND STILL IS - A CONTROVERSIAL STEP. THIS IS BECAUSE THE WORLD BANK, LIKE MOST OTHER MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS, IS PROHIBITED BY ITS BASIC LEGAL DOCUMENT, THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT, FROM INTERFERING IN THE POLITICAL AFFAIRS OF ITS MEMBERS. IT MUST MAKE ITS DECISIONS ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ONLY. FOLLOWING THE 2011 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT, WHICH MADE THE CASE FOR WORLD BANK INVOLVEMENT IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE, IN EARLY 2012 THE BANK'S LEGAL VICE PRESIDENCY RELEASED THE LEGAL NOTE ON BANK INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR AND A STAFF GUIDANCE NOTE: WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACTIVITIES. THIS PAPER SHOWS HOW THE LEGAL NOTE AND THE GUIDANCE NOTE, BY OFFERING NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORLD BANK'S MANDATE AND OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR, SEEK TO INCORPORATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM WITHIN THE WORLD BANK'S GOVERNANCE AGENDA. IT ARGUES THAT THE INTERPRETATION OFFERED BY THESE DOCUMENTS IS UNCONVINCING IN ADDRESSING THE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE POLITICAL PROHIBITION CLAUSE, BEING THE INJUNCTION TO DECIDE ON THE BASIS OF ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ONLY AND THE PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. AS A RESULT, THE LEGAL NOTE DOES NOT ENTIRELY SUCCEED IN ITS MISSION TO PROVIDE '...A GENERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING WHICH INTERVENTIONS BY THE BANK IN THIS SECTOR WOULD FALL WITHIN THE WORLD BANK'S MANDATE UNDER ITS ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT'. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING THAT SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS IN THE LEGAL NOTE AND THE GUIDANCE NOTE CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE PURPOSE OF THIS NEW LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF THE MANDATE, WHICH IS NOT SO MUCH TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT LEGAL ARGUMENT, BUT RATHER - AND ABOVE ALL - TO PLAY [TO] CONSTITUENCIES WITH DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND MAINTAIN THE MYTH OF A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD BANK'S MANDATE AND MISSION.
462	HOW DO RUMORS EMERGE AND SPREAD? ONE EXPLANATION EMPHASIZES SOME FORM OF CRISIS AND UNCERTAINTY AS THE FACILITATING CONDITION AND ANOTHER STRAND OF RESEARCH FOCUSES ON MICRO-LEVEL DYNAMICS TO EXPLAIN HOW SOME GROUPS ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO RUMORS THAN OTHERS. THIS ARTICLE APPLIES FRAMING THEORY TO EXAMINE A RUMOR THAT LED TO VIOLENCE THAT KILLED FARKHUNDA MALIKZADA IN AFGHANISTAN IN MARCH 2015 AND THREE SEPARATE PROTESTS AGAINST THE INCIDENT. FOCUSING ON HOW DIFFERENT GROUPS UNDERSTAND AND REINTERPRET RUMORS, THE ARTICLE MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN RUMOR AS AN INFORMATIONAL SHORTCUT AND AN INSTRUMENT OF DELIBERATE MANIPULATION OF INFORMATION.
463	THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ("CJEU") IN THE CASE OF GOOGLE SPAIN SL V AGENCIA ESPANOLA DE PROTECCION DE DATOS (AEPD)(2) ["THE GOOGLE DECISION"] TO REQUIRE GOOGLE TO ENFORCE A RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN HAS CAUSED A FURORE AND SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT IN INTERNET REGULATION.(3) IT IS SETTING UP THE SEARCH ENGINE AS A FORM OF INTERNET GOVERNMENT AND FRACTURING THE BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY AND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IN THE CONNECTED WORLD. IN A WORLD WHERE WE HAVE BECOME ATTUNED TO FULL EXPOSURE BY ROUTINELY SIGNING OVER ACCESS TO INFORMATION, PRIVACY IS NO LONGER THE ISSUE - THE REAL CONCERN IS CONTROL. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF WHETHER WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY ANYMORE, WHO SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND WHERE AND HOW A GLOBAL CONVENTION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION MIGHT BE ACHIEVED.

464	IN THIS PRESENTATION I ARTICULATE SOME CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE MULTICULTURAL CONSTITUTION IN LATIN AMERICA AS IT WAY RECENTLY ENACTED IN SOME ANDEAN COUNTRIES LIKE BOLIVIA AND ECUADOR. THE MULTICULTURAL CONSTITUTION, AS A PROCESS OF EMANCIPATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN LATIN AMERICA HAS PROVOKED NOT ONLY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE TRADITIONAL LEGAL ARCHITECTURE OF LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM BUT ALSO PERMITTED THE USE OF THE CONSTITUTION AS A COUNTER-HEGEMONIC AND DECOLONIZING INSTRUMENT.. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION OF INDIGENOUS JUSTICE AND ITS OWN DISTINCT FORMS OF LEGAL PRODUCTION, HAS CHALLENGED THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF FORMAL LAW. PARADOXICALLY, THE RE-EMERGENCE OF INDIGENOUS LAW AND JUSTICE WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE USE OF FORMAL AND LEGAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH HISTORICALLY HAD BEEN USED TO STRENGTHEN COLONIAL DOMINANCE OVER INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. I WILL ANALYZE VERY BRIEFLY THE CASE OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF CHIBULEO AND THEIR OWN SYSTEM OF JUSTICE STRESSING THE EMANCIPATORY AND SOCIAL COHESION EFFECTS WHICH HAVE RESULTED FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUTONOMOUS INDIGENOUS JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON SOME THEORETICAL TOOLS PROVIDED BY GLOBALIZATION STUDIES AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SCHOLARSHIP AND FOCUSED ON THE TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE THAT GLOBAL COUNTER-HEGEMONIC SOCIAL MOVEMENTS HAVE PLAYED IN THE DE-CONSTRUCTION OF TRADITIONAL STATE IN A CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION IN SOME COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA.
465	DAME ROSALYN HIGGINS DBE QC DELIVERED THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT THE CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE, 'DEVELOPING DEMOCRACY: CONVERSATIONS ON DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN INTERNATIONAL, EUROPEAN AND COMPARATIVE LAW', ON FRIDAY 8 MAY AT THE DIVINITY SCHOOL OF ST JOHN'S COLLEGE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. THIS ADDRESS EXAMINES THE PLACE OF DEMOCRACY IN INTERNATIONAL LAW, FOCUSING ON INSTRUMENTS FROM THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO THE MONTEVIDEO CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES. THESE INSTRUMENTS ILLUSTRATE THAT DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT FOR RECOGNITION OF STATEHOOD. RATHER, THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY AS A SIGNIFICANT VALUE IS EVIDENT IN HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS WHICH SUGGEST THAT DEMOCRACY, RATHER THAN BEING A FREE-STANDING LEGAL CONCEPT, IS INTERTWINED WITH CONCEPTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ADDRESS CONCLUDES BY REFLECTING ON THE MOST RECENT TRAJECTORY OF DEMOCRACY AS A CONCEPT AMONGST THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMUNITY.
466	IN THE LAST DECADE BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES TO LEGAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR. EXAMPLES ARE REFORM IDEAS AND PROGRAMMES USING CONCEPTS SUCH AS 'ACCESS TO JUSTICE' AND 'LEGAL EMPOWERMENT.' THESE APPROACHES SHARE A COMMON CONCERN THAT LEGAL INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BENEFIT THE POOR, AND THAT THEIR NEEDS AND PREFERENCES SHOULD FORM THE BASIS FOR LEGAL REFORMS. PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THESE APPROACHES ARE IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVES TO INEFFECTIVE PRE-EXISTING LEGAL REFORM PRACTICES WHICH WERE BASED ON 'THE RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY.' THIS PAPER CRITICALLY DISCUSSES THE CONTENT, CONTEXT AND MERITS OF SUCH BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHILE THESE APPROACHES OFF ER ADVANTAGES, THEY SHOULD NOT SUBSTITUTE BUT COMPLEMENT PRE-EXISTING LEGAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION PRACTICES AND THE RULE OF LAW PARADIGM ON WHICH THEY ARE BASED. THE EMERGENCE OF THESE NEW APPROACHES SHOWS HOW MUCH LEGAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION IS A FIELD OF TRENDS, WHERE DOUBTS ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS FORCE LEGAL REFORMERS TO REGULARLY SHIFT FROM ONE PARADIGM TO THE NEXT, ENTHUSIASTICALLY APPLAUDING THE SEEMINGLY NEW, WHILE SACRIFICING THE CARICATURIZED OLD.
467	THIS COMMENTARY ANALYSES THE JUDGMENT ISSUED BY THE CJEU IN THE CASE C-78/18 THAT CONFRONTS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AGAINST HUNGARY ON THE OCCASION OF THE ADOPTION OF THE TRANSPARENCY LAW OR LEX NGO, WHICH IMPOSES OBLIGATIONS OF PUBLICITY, REGISTRATION AND DECLARATION TO THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVE FOREIGN FUNDS. THE JUDGMENT, ISSUED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF AN INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE BROUGHT BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, ESTABLISHES THAT HUNGARY HAS INCURRED IN A BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE APPLICABLE TREATIES BY VIOLATING ARTICLES 63 TFEU AND 12, 7 AND 8 OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EU. THIS WORK CARRIES OUT A CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE LEGAL ARGUMENTS OF THE GRAND CHAMBER, THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ADVOCATE GENERAL AND THE SCHOLARLY WRITINGS ON THE ISSUES AT STAKE, AND EXAMINES THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE UNION TO CURB THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIANISM AND THE PERSISTENT BREACH OF ITS VALUES BY ITS MEMBER STATES.
468	ON 14 DECEMBER 2017, THE ASSEMBLY OF STATES PARTIES OF THE ROME STATUTE DECIDED TO ACTIVATE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT'S JURISDICTION OVER THE CRIME OF AGGRESSION. IN DOING SO, IT HOWEVER SEEMS TO HAVE RESCINDED THE KAMPALA AMENDMENT ADOPTED IN 2010, AND IN PARTICULAR, THE NEED FOR STATE PARTIES TO EVENTUALLY OPT OUT FROM THE COURT'S AGGRESSION-RELATED JURISDICTION. THIS REVERSAL, WHILE BEING MORE IN LINE WITH THE ROME STATUTE THAN THE KAMPALA AMENDMENT ITSELF, RAISES NEW (AND OLD) AND CHALLENGING LEGAL QUESTIONS WHICH ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS ARTICLE.
469	PART 1 OF THIS PAPER (PUBLISHED IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE) DOCUMENTED COMPARATIVE CASE LAW IN A NUMBER OF AREAS - FROM THE SINGLE MARKET TO THE DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE, EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT, ESM TREATY AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW - WHERE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS HAVE BEEN LEVELLED DOWNWARDS IN THE CONTEXT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF EU LAW IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES. HERE, PART 2 OF THE PAPER PROPOUNDS THE CONCEPT OF 'SUBSTANTIVE CO-OPERATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM', EXPLORING HOW EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW DISCOURSE COULD BE RECALIBRATED TOWARDS A GREATER RESPONSIVENESS TO SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. PART 2 STARTS BY OUTLINING AN INCREASING SHIFT FROM THE MINDSET AND VOCABULARY OF CLASSIC, COMPARATIVE (CONTINENTAL) EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, TO A MORE FORMAL, PROCEDURAL, THIN VERSION OF EU CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHERE THE KEYWORDS ARE SUPREMACY, UNIFORMITY, DIRECT EFFECT, AUTONOMY, EFFECTIVENESS AND TRUST. INDEED IN THE CONTEXT OF DEMOCRACY AND LEGITIMACY IN TRANSNATIONAL GOVERNANCE, SOME SCHOLARS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 'EROSION', 'TWILIGHT' OR 'DECLINE' OF CONSTITUTIONALISM OR 'THE END OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AS WE KNOW IT'. MORE RECENTLY, EURO CRISIS MEASURES HAVE PROMPTED HEIGHTENED CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROLONGED AND PERHAPS EVEN IRREVERSIBLE SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE RECHTSSTAAT AND DEMOCRACY. YET IN THE MAINSTREAM EU AND TRANSNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW DISCOURSE, SUCH CONCERNS HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED LIMIT-ED ATTENTION. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE REASONS FOR THE SHIFT IN THE PARADIGM OF CONSTITUTIONALISM ON THE BASIS OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF EU LAW AND OF TRANSNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND ARGUES THAT SUCH A SHIFT IS NOT THE ONLY WAY FORWARD. THE PAPER THEN PROCEEDS TO OUTLINE SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW A MORE SUBSTANTIVE VERSION OF CO-OPERATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM COULD BE OPERATIONALISED IN PRACTICE. THIS INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROBING AND PROACTIVE ROLE FOR THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, SUPREME COURTS AND NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS, AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF MECHANISMS IN THE EU INSTITUTIONAL AND JUDICIAL FRAMEWORK FOR GREATER RESPONSIVENESS TO CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND CONSTITUTIONAL DIVERSITY.
470	AN EARLIER PAPER SHOWED THAT AN ECONOMY COULD BE TRAPPED IN AN EQUILIBRIUM STATE IN WHICH THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW LED TO ASSET-STRIPPING AND THE PREVALENCE OF ASSET-STRIPPING LED TO THE ABSENCE OF A DEMAND FOR THE RULE OF LAW, HIGHLIGHTING A COORDINATION FAILURE. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS MORE CAREFULLY AT THE DYNAMICS OF TRANSITION FROM A NON-RULE-OF-LAW STATE. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES A COMMITMENT PROBLEM AS THE CRITICAL FEATURE INHIBITING THE TRANSITION: THE INABILITY, UNDER A RULE OF LAW, TO FORGIVE THEFT. THIS CAN LEAD TO THE PERPETUATION OF THE NON-RULE-OF-LAW STATE, EVEN WHEN IT MIGHT SEEM THAT THE ALTERNATIVE IS PARETO-IMPROVING.
471	IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT JURIDICAL ROOT TO THE PROBLEM OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE IN MALAYSIA. THAT ROOT IS HOBBISM, AN AUTHORITARIAN CONCEPTION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY AS A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. I SHOW ITS INFLUENCE BY FOCUSING ON THREE PIVOTAL EVENTS IN MALAYSIA'S LEGAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY. THE ANALYSIS AIMS TO PROVIDE A MORE NUANCED PICTURE OF THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN MALAYSIA AND TO SUGGEST THAT THESE FACTORS ARE NOT PURELY POLITICAL; THEY ALSO HAVE A BASIS IN HOW OFFICIALS CONCEIVE OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. MY ARGUMENT SHOWS THAT THE INFLUENCE OF HOBBISM HAS WORKED IN BOTH WAYS TO PRODUCE THE PROBLEM OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN MALAYSIA. IT HAS SUBVERTED WELL-MINDED OFFICIALS FROM AFFIRMING THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WHILE ALLOWING AUTHORITARIAN POLITICIANS TO EXPLOIT HOBBISM TO SERVE THEIR AUTHORITARIAN AIMS. I ARGUE THAT HOBBISM IS SO WELL ENTRENCHED IN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL CULTURE THAT MALAYSIAN LAW AND POLITICS WILL NOT EASILY TRANSITION TO MORE MEANINGFULLY EXPRESS A COMMITMENT TO SERVE THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
472	THE AUTHOR ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP FIVE CRITICAL RESEARCH GUIDELINES FROM TOMMASO GRECO'S WORK ENTITLED "THE LAW OF TRUST". THE FIVE CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ARE DEDICATED TO: THE AUTONOMY OF THE SUBJECT; THE NATURE OF SOLIDARITY; THE PARADIGM OF EQUITY; THE CLAIM OF THE SUBJECT AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM; THE RESPONSIBILITY IN OBEYING AND DISOBEYING A LEGAL SYSTEM.THE PREMISE OF THESE FIVE PERSPECTIVES, WHICH ARE BOTH AN INSTRUMENT OF ANALYSIS AND PROPOSALS FOR IN-DEPTH STUDY, IS RECOGNISED IN THE GENERAL MERIT OF GRECO'S BOOK OF ATTEMPTING A REFOUNDING OF LAW ON THE BASIS OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE PROTAGONISM OF THE HUMAN SUBJECT.
473	THE RECOGNITION OF THE HUMAN BEING, THEIR LIFE, HEALTH, HONOR, DIGNITY, INVIOLABILITY, AND SECURITY, AS THE HIGHEST SOCIAL VALUE IS A KEY PRINCIPLE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF UKRAINE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE SPECTRUM OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF IN-DEPTH THEORETICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS. THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE MODERN PERCEPTION OF HUMAN VALUE, REACHING THE DEPTHS OF THE BIRTH OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, THE REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS IN THE EUROPEAN PAST, THE WORLD WARS, AND THE ADOPTION OF THE UN UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE REFLECTED IN MANY STATES' CONSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING MODERN UKRAINE'S. AT THE SAME TIME, CERTAIN PROBLEMS ARE OBVIOUS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONTENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS BETWEEN WESTERN AND EASTERN CIVILIZATIONS, CHRISTIAN AND MUSLIM BELIEFS, AND THE DIVERSE CONSTITUTIONAL DECLARATIONS WITH THEIR LEGISLATIVE IMPLEMENTATION, AS WELL AS THE SEPARATION OF NEW HUMAN RIGHTS, PROBLEMS THAT ARE INCREASINGLY ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS.
474	THE PRESENT ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EU POSSESSES AN ARSENAL OF TOOLS TO ADDRESS DISSUASIVELY RULE OF LAW PROBLEMS IN THE MEMBER STATES. THIS SHOWS THE DOUBLE NATURE OF THE EU'S SEPARATION OF POWERS PROBLEM. WHEREAS SOME STATES SUFFER FROM RULE OF LAW DECLINE AND A LACK OF LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS, THERE IS A RISK OF THE CRUMBLING OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AT THE EU LEVEL, TOO, WHERE INSTITUTIONS FAIL TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS RULE OF LAW VIOLATIONS. AGAINST THE EU INSTITUTION'S LACK OF FORCEFUL ACTION TOWARDS RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING, DOMESTIC COURTS TRY TO PROTECT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE INCREASINGLY VIA PRELIMINARY REFERENCES. ALSO, THEY ATTEMPT PREVENTING THE PROLIFERATION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF RULE OF LAW DECLINE VIA JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN THE MUTUAL TRUST/MUTUAL RECOGNITION DOMAIN. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES TO WHAT EXTENT PRELIMINARY RULINGS CAN MAKE UP FOR THE FAILURE TO USE ADEQUATE EU TOOLS OF RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
475	THE CLASSICAL DISPUTE OVER THE AUTONOMY OR DEPENDENCE OF LAW REGARDING OTHER FIELDS OF HUMAN ACTION HAS BEEN LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND MORALS AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE OBLIGATORY NATURE OF LAW. IN THIS PAPER WE APPROACH THIS DISCUSSION FROM THE ALTERNATIVE POINT OF VIEW OF THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE SOURCES OF LAW AND, PARTICULARLY, OF OBJECTIVITY OF THE JUDICIAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS THAT PRODUCE/MODIFY/EXTINGUISH THE LAW (THE SOURCES OF LAW). ALONG THESE LINES, WE ARGUE THAT THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE SOURCES OF LAW ENTAILS A NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LAW, ON THE ONE HAND, AND A GIVEN ANTHROPOLOGICAL-AXIOLOGICAL ORDER. MORE ACCURATELY, IT ENTAILS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LAW AND A GIVEN -NOT CONVENTIONAL- TYPOLOGY OF INTENTIONAL ACTION.
476	THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME HAS ENCOURAGED SOME COMMENTATORS TO CONSTRUCT LINEAR, 'PROGRESS NARRATIVES' WHEN WRITING ON THE HISTORY OF THE FIELD. SUCH NARRATIVES DEPICT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW AS SUBJECT TO GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT, STARTING AS A HIGHLY POLITICISED, ABSTRACT COLLECTION OF PRINCIPLES, BUT EVENTUALLY EMERGING AS A NEATLY CONTOURED, LEGITIMATE FRAMEWORK. HOWEVER, FROM ITS INCEPTION, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW HAS BEEN INSEPARABLE FROM THE SELECTIVE APPLICATION (OR NON-APPLICATION) AS WELL AS SELECTIVE CREATION (OR NON-CREATION) OF LAW. SELECTIVITY HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS FORMS OVER THE DECADES, AND IN SOME INSTANCES, HAS PROVEN TO BE USEFUL. HOWEVER, AS LONG AS SELECTIVITY CONTINUES TO EXIST, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW WILL REMAIN AT ODDS WITH OUR WIDER CONCEPTIONS OF LAW.
477	IN THIS CONTRIBUTION WE SKETCH THE MOST IMPORTANT THEMES OF WILLEM WITTEVEEN'S WORK. RATHER THAN PROVIDING AN ACADEMIC OVERVIEW WE USE ONE OF HIS FAVOURITE METAPHORS, THAT OF THE HOUSE, TO SHOW THE BREADTH OF HIS INTERESTS AND THE APPROACH THAT CHARACTERIZES BOTH HIS WRITINGS AND HIS PUBLIC ACHIEVEMENTS. ALTHOUGH MOST LEGAL SCHOLARS WILL KNOW OF HIS WORK ON LEGISLATION AND THE RECHTSSTAAT, HIS INTEREST IN LEGAL THEORY, LITERATURE AND ART IS EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT TO UNDERSTAND HIS CONTRIBUTION TO LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. HIS WORK IS UNIFIED BY HIS RHETORICAL STANCE, WHICH WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO DIFFERENT VOICES OF THE PRESENT AND THE PAST.
478	THERE ARE CURRENTLY A NUMBER OF LEGAL MECHANISMS WITHIN AFRICAN REGIONAL ORGANISATIONS AIMED AT DETERRING MILITARY COUPS AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT. CONSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTIES WITHIN POST-COLONIAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE GROWTH OF REGIONAL SECURITY INITIATIVES LED TO THE CREATION OF THESE MECHANISMS, AND AS RECENT PRACTICE SHOWS THEY ARE PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. USING CONTEMPORARY CASE STUDIES THIS PAPER ASSESSES HOW THESE MECHANISMS EVOLVED AND EXPLORES THE LEGAL IMPACT THAT THEY ARE HAVING.
479	A RELIGIOUS PRACTICE -THE USE OF THE INTEGRAL VEIL- OPENED AN IMPORTANT DEBATE ON THE LIMITS OF PUBLIC ORDER IN RELATION TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. FOLLOWING THE ETUDE OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE ADOPTED IN 2010, SEVERAL DISTINCTIONS WERE MADE: BETWEEN A MATERIAL AND IMMATERIAL CONCEPTION OF PUBLIC ORDER, BETWEEN ITS CLASSICAL CONCEPTION AND A RENEWED ONE AND, ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL, BETWEEN THE LIBERAL AND THE "REPUBLICAN" CONCEPTION. THE LINK BETWEEN PUBLIC ORDER AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE IT MAINTAINS WITH OTHER FREEDOMS, SINCE POLITICAL HISTORY HAS UNITED THEM IN REFLECTING ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE MODERN STATE. THE SEARCH AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE LIMITS OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM LEADS TO A MORE GENERAL QUESTIONING OF THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL MODEL OF THE HUMAN COMMUNITY. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS DEBATE ON THE CONTENT OF PUBLIC ORDER IS BASED ON WHETHER RELIGIONS, BEYOND RESPECTING PUBLIC ORDER IN THE STRICT SENSE, CAN BE REQUIRED TO RESPECT THE MORAL ORDER OF A SECULARIZED SOCIETY.
480	IN RECENT YEARS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN DEPLOYED BY ONLINE PLATFORMS TO PREVENT THE UPLOAD OF ALLEGEDLY ILLEGAL CONTENT OR TO REMOVE UNWARRANTED EXPRESSIONS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE TRAINED TO SPOT OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT AND TO REMOVE IT, BLOCK IT, OR FILTER IT OUT BEFORE IT IS EVEN UPLOADED. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FILTERS OFFER A ROBUST APPROACH TO CONTENT MODERATION WHICH IS SHAPING THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT IN NORM SETTING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IS POTENTIALLY GAME-CHANGING FOR DEMOCRACY. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FILTERS CARRY CENSORIAL POWER, WHICH COULD BYPASS TRADITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES SECURED BY LAW. THEIR OPAQUE AND DYNAMIC NATURE CREATES BARRIERS TO OVERSIGHT, AND CONCEALS CRITICAL VALUE CHOICES AND TRADEOFFS. CURRENTLY, WE LACK ADEQUATE TOOLS TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP BY INTRODUCING AN ADVERSARIAL PROCEDURE- - CONTESTING ALGORITHMS. IT PROPOSES TO DELIBERATELY INTRODUCE FRICTION INTO THE DOMINANT REMOVAL SYSTEMS GOVERNED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. ALGORITHMIC CONTENT MODERATION OFTEN SEEKS TO OPTIMIZE A SINGLE GOAL, SUCH AS REMOVING COPYRIGHT-INFRINGING MATERIALS OR BLOCKING HATE SPEECH, WHILE OTHER VALUES IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, SUCH AS FAIR USE OR FREE SPEECH, ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED. CONTESTING ALGORITHMS INTRODUCE AN ADVERSARIAL DESIGN WHICH REFLECTS CONFLICTING VALUES, AND THEREBY MAY OFFER A CHECK ON DOMINANT REMOVAL SYSTEMS. FACILITATING AN ADVERSARIAL INTERVENTION MAY PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES BY KEEPING SOCIETY IN THE LOOP. AN ADVERSARIAL PUBLIC ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM COULD ENHANCE DYNAMIC TRANSPARENCY, FACILITATE AN ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC ARTICULATION OF SOCIAL VALUES USING MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS, AND RESTORE SOCIETAL POWER TO DELIBERATE AND DETERMINE SOCIAL TRADEOFFS.
481	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE OBSTACLES TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE APPROACHES THAT CAN HELP TO OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES. DEMOCRACY IS NEVER PERFECT BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES OF DEVELOPING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, YET THE DRAWBACKS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY ARE CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY. WE CONSIDER PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AS AN ELEMENT OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY INTEGRATED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE POWER OF THE CENTRE WITH THAT OF THE CONSTITUENT MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. WE UNDERSCORE THE ROLE OF NOMOCRACY, BY WHICH WE MEAN PROMOTING THE POWER OF EQUITABLE LEGAL AND OTHER SOCIAL RULES OVER THE POWER OF THE CENTRE. IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, THE FUNCTIONING OF RULES FACES GREATER OBSTACLES THAN IN OTHER FORMS OF DEMOCRACY. THUS, THE PROFESSIONALISM OF PLANNERS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN FORMULATING THESE RULES; IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHEN THE CHALLENGES OF ESTABLISHING RULES ARE MAJOR OR INSUPERABLE. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO TYPES OF PLANNING PROFESSIONALISM: TELEOCRATIC (BASED PRIMARILY ON TECHNOCRATIC SKILLS) AND NOMOCRATIC (BASED ON THE NOMOCRATIC LIBERAL APPROACH). WE RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FORMER, BUT OUR MAIN CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEBATE ON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS TO EMPHASIZE THE CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE AND PRIORITY OF NOMOCRATIC PROFESSIONALISM IN OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES OF CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT AND THE SHORTCOMINGS OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. TO TEST OUR CONCLUSIONS, WE EXPLORE THE PRACTICE OF CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING BIKEWAY NETWORKS IN SEVERAL LARGE BULGARIAN CITIES, WHERE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS FRUSTRATED BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE TELEOCRATIC APPROACH AND THE LACK OF NOMOCRATIC TRADITIONS.
482	JOURNALISTS IN MEXICO FACE HUNDREDS OF ATTACKS EACH YEAR, RANGING FROM ONLINE HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION TO OUTRIGHT MURDER. THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE TYPICALLY CLAIMS THAT MURDERED JOURNALISTS ARE THE VICTIMS OF GENERAL CRIMINAL VIOLENCE. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT DESPITE THE RAMPANT VIOLENCE IN MEXICO, THE MURDER OF JOURNALISTS CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTRY'S GENERAL CRIMINAL VIOLENCE PROBLEM ALONE. INSTEAD, THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THE TARGETING, AND EVEN POLITICAL TARGETING OF JOURNALISTS. FIRST, JOURNALISTS ARE AT A MUCH HIGHER RISK OF BEING MURDERED THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. SECOND, THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN HOMICIDE RATES AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION AND AMONG JOURNALISTS VARIES CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN MEXICAN STATES. WHILE RECENT SCHOLARSHIP HAS SHOWN THAT SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS CAN SUCCESSFULLY REMAIN AUTHORITARIAN DESPITE DEMOCRATIZATION AT THE CENTRAL OR FEDERAL LEVEL, THIS LITERATURE HAS LARGELY IGNORED THE USE OF POLITICAL KILLINGS IN SUBNATIONAL UNDEMOCRATIC REGIMES. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO UNDERSTAND THE MURDER OF JOURNALISTS NOT JUST AS A PROBLEM OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE, BUT ALSO OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, AND THEREBY CONNECTS THE FINDINGS TO THE EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP ON SUBNATIONAL AUTHORITARIANISM.
483	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE APPEAL TO LAW AS THE BASIS FOR CIVIC IDENTITY AND POLITICAL BELONGING UNDER CONDITIONS OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY. BEGINNING BY ASSESSING THE DESCRIPTIVE UTILITY OF THE CONCEPT OF SECULARISM', THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SECULARISM IS BEST APPROACHED AS A REPERTOIRE OF MOVES AVAILABLE IN NEGOTIATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY, FOCUSING THEN ON ONE SUCH MOVE EVIDENT IN THE CONTEMPORARY PROJECT OF LIBERAL SECULARISM: THE ASSERTION, IN THE FACE OF THE CHALLENGES POSED BY RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY, THAT TO BELONG TO THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY MEANS, ABOVE ALL ELSE, TO BELONG TO LAW. THIS SHIFT OF OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW' TO THE DIAGNOSTIC CENTER OF CIVIC BELONGING IS EXPLORED BY TURNING TO TWO CASE STUDIES DRAWN FROM THE LEGAL ENCOUNTER WITH ISLAM IN CANADA: THE DEBATE OVER OFFICIAL RECOGNITION OF SHARIA LAW AND CONTROVERSIES SURROUNDING THE NIQAB. HAVING ASSESSED THE IMPLICATIONS THAT THIS MOVE HAS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGEMENT OF RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCE, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS SYMBOLIC APPEAL TO LAW - WHEREBY LAW BEGINS TO STAND AS A KIND OF SYNECDOCHE FOR THE SECULAR STATE - AND ASSESSES THE EFFECT OF THIS ALIGNMENT OF LAW AND BELONGING ON THE POLITICS OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY.
484	IN POLITICAL SCIENCE, WE DEAL WITH A SERIES OF IDEAS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY POLITICAL IDEALS. IN COMPARATIVE POLITICS, WE NEED CONCEPTS THAT ARE ABLE TO "TRAVEL" ACROSS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS AND CAPABLE OF BEING MEASURED. INCLUSION IS AN EQUIVOCAL NOTION IN WHICH BOTH ASPECTS CONVERGE: ON THE ONE HAND, INCLUSION IS USED AS A CODE FOR NORMATIVE CLAIMS REGARDING, FOR EXAMPLE, PARTICIPATION, EQUALITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE AND RECOGNITION. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT CAN BE APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL FOR ASSESSING A QUALITY OF POLITICAL REGIMES. HOW CAN INCLUSION BE DEFINED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS VALUE ORIENTATION AND SERVE AT THE SAME TIME AS AN EMPIRICAL CONCEPT FOR SYSTEMATIC-QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH? COMBINING THE PERSPECTIVES OF DEMOCRACY AND CITIZENSHIP THEORY-TWO STRANDS THAT RUN PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER WITHOUT MUCH INTERACTION-I DEFINE AND OPERATIONALIZE INCLUSION AS A PROPERTY OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS. STARTING FROM A NORMATIVE CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY AND CITIZENSHIP THAT LEADS TO A PROCEDURAL DEFINITION, I CONCEIVE OF DEMOCRATIC INCLUSION AS CIVIC AND POLITICAL INCLUSION AND LAY OUT DIMENSIONS FOR COMPARATIVELY ASSESSING POLITICAL REGIMES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INCLUSIONEXCLUSION.
485	THIS PAPER TRIES TO POINT OUT THAT THE THREE CONSECUTIVE CRISES (THE TRIPLE CRISIS) IN THE NEW MEMBER STATES (NMS) HAVE CLAIMED THE HEAVY SOCIAL PRICE THAT HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DRASTIC "BACKSLIDING OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES". THESE COUNTRIES UNDERWENT A TRANSFORMATION RECESSION IN THE EARLY NINETIES AND, ONCE MEMBERS OF THE EU, THEY FELL INTO THE POST-ACCESSION CRISIS, FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THE GLOBAL CRISIS. ORIGINALLY, THEIR POPULATIONS REACTED TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE AUTHORITARIAN RULE WITH A "REVOLUTION OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS", SO UNDER THE LABEL OF DEMOCRACY THEY EXPECTED A WESTERN WELFARE STATE "OVERNIGHT", THUS AFTER TWENTY YEARS THE DISAPPOINTMENT HAS BEEN TRAGIC. THIS PAPER APPROACHES THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY IN NMS FROM THE SIDE OF THE TRIPLE CRISIS IN GENERAL AND FROM THAT OF HUNGARY IN PARTICULAR. ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE VERY TEMPTING TO GENERALIZE ON THE NMS BACKSLIDING, THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER IS ON "THE COUNTRY I KNOW BEST", I.E. ON HUNGARY WITH ITS IDIOSYNCRASIES.
486	THIS PAPER ANALYZES CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AS IT PERTAINS TO THE POWERS, COMPOSITION, SELECTION PROCEDURES, AND DURATION OF THE MANDATE OF SUPREME COURTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNALS IN 17 LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1900 AND 2009. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ORIGINAL DATABASE THAT CONTAINS THE TEXT OF ALL CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLES IN THE CENTRAL ORGANS OF THE JUDICIARY. THE PAPER RELIES ON THIS INFORMATION TO DEMONSTRATE TO WHAT DEGREE THE JOB STABILITY OF MAGISTRATES CAN BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS THAT REGULATE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. OUR ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES THAT THE SURVIVAL OF MAGISTRATES IS DETERMINED BY THE STABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, RATHER THAN ANY SPECIFIC LEGAL CONTENT.
487	NORMATIVE REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE USE OF ANIMALS IN EXPERIMENTS AND EDUCATION RAISE NUMEROUS CONTROVERSIES AND MUCH SOCIAL DISCUSSION. ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS FORM OF SOCIAL ACTIVITY IS THE USE OF CONSTITUTIONAL, SUBJECTIVE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION. COMPETENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS ENCOUNTER NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. ATTEMPTS TO ASSESS, EVALUATE, AND VERIFY WHETHER THE APPLICANTS' GOALS AND INTENTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE AXIOLOGICAL PREMISES OF THE STATUTORY NORMS OCCUR. THE STUDY REVEALS VETERINARY, LEGAL, AND MORAL ASPECTS OF REQUESTS FOR ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THE USE OF ANIMALS IN TESTING AND TEACHING PROCEDURES. THE CONTROVERSIAL CONCEPT OF ABUSE/MISUSE OF THE SUBJECTIVE RIGHT TO ACCESS INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN A CRITICAL, MULTIFACETED WAY. OBLIGATIONS OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF VETERINARY SURGEONS CONCERNING LABORATORY ANIMALS AND PUBLIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THEM ARE DISCUSSED. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CONSISTENCY OF NORMATIVE REGULATIONS ARE ASSESSED. INTERPRETATIONAL POSTULATES ARE INDICATED.
488	THIS WORK ANALYSES THE INNER STRUCTURE AND THE LOGICAL CONDITIONS OF "UNDERSTANDING" IN THE FIELD OF LAW, TAKING FOR REFERENCE ANDREI ' S MARMOR PROPOSAL. THE ANALYSIS LEADS TO THE THESIS OF THE NECESSARY CONNECTION BETWEEN COMPREHENSION AND SEMANTIC REALISM. STANDING UPON THIS THESIS, I ARGUE THAT, THE MORE LEGAL DISCOURSES ASSUME THE POWER TO AUTONOMOUSLY CREATE THEIR OWN MEANING, THE LESS THEIR INTELLIGIBILITY AND THEIR CHANCES OF BEING UNDERSTOOD. THIS GENERAL THESIS IS SUSTAINED ON TWO MAIN ARGUMENTS. FIRST, THE INHERENT DARKNESS OF THE REFERENCE OF CONCEPTS WHOSE MEANING IS HELD TO BE PURELY CONVENTIONAL. SECONDLY, THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SAVING THE PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING FROM THE CLASSICAL MUNCHHAUSEN TRILEMMA.
489	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, EITHER DIRECTLY OR VIA A SPILLOVER EFFECT, HAS A DETERRENT EFFECT ON WHITE COLLAR CRIMES. USING DATA ON NEARLY 150 NATIONS AND VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT, INCLUDING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR NON-VIOLENT CRIMES, WE CONSIDER TWO WIDELY PREVALENT WHITE-COLLAR CRIMES-CORRUPTION AND THE SHADOW ECONOMY. NESTING THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IN THE BROADER LITERATURE ON DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION AND THE SHADOW ECONOMY, WE FIND THAT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN GENERAL REDUCED BOTH CORRUPTION AND THE SHADOW ECONOMY, AND THE DETERRENT EFFECT ON THE SHADOW ECONOMY WAS RELATIVELY MORE PREVALENT. ADDING SOME EMPIRICAL INSIGHTS TO THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS SURROUNDING THE DESIRABILITY OF MAXIMAL PUNISHMENTS, RESULTS SHOW SOME TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF PUNISHMENT.
490	KENYA'S 2010 CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS DEVOLVED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND INCLUDED A QUOTA DESIGNED TO SECURE A MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT. WHILE THE 2017 ELECTIONS YIELDED THE COUNTRY'S HIGHEST PROPORTION OF WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT IN HISTORY VIA BOTH ELECTED AND APPOINTED POSITIONS, MANY POLITICAL ENTITIES STILL FELL SHORT OF THE NEW GENDER RULE, LEAVING THEM IN NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION. THE 2017 ELECTIONS REVEAL A TENSION: WHILE DEVOLUTION RAISED THE STAKES OF LOCAL ELECTIONS AND THE QUOTA HAS IMPROVED WOMEN'S POLITICAL INCLUSION, THESE REFORMS HAVE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE POWER OF POLITICAL PARTIES, THE WAY CAMPAIGNS ARE FINANCED, CULTURAL IDEAS ABOUT WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP, AND THE PERVASIVENESS OF VIOLENCE IN KENYAN ELECTIONS. DRAWING ON DATA FROM BOTH THE NATIONAL AND COUNTY LEVELS, THIS ARTICLE MAPS THESE PERSISTENT OBSTACLES TO WOMEN'S POLITICAL INCLUSION AND ARGUES THAT INCREASING WOMEN'S POLITICAL POWER WILL REQUIRE BOTH THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTION, AS WELL AS A BROADER CONSIDERATION OF HOW POWER OPERATES AND IS CONSOLIDATED.
491	BY COMPARING THE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MILL AND HAYEK'S THEORY OF LIBERTY, THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT SOME SIMILARITIES IN THE ECONOMIC THEORIES OF MILL AND HAYEK ARE ACTUALLY BASED ON DIFFERENT RATIONALES. IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO FIND A COMMON THREAD IN MILL AND HAYEK TO PROVIDE REASONABLE GUIDANCE FOR SOCIAL POLICY CAN BE PROMISING ONLY IF WE CAN FIND THE COMMON GROUND FROM THEIR SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY. WHILE ANALYZING THE RATIONALES BEHIND THEIR OPINIONS REGARDING THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT AND TAXATION POLICIES, THIS PAPER WILL FOCUS ON EXPLORING THE ROLE OF TWO PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE. THIS WILL CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL JUSTICE AND LIBERTY AS WELL AS THEIR STATUS IN RELATION TO THE ULTIMATE PRINCIPLE OF RULES IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MILL AND HAYEK. THIS PAPER WILL OFFER AN EXPLANATION WHY, IN MILL'S UTILITARIAN PHILOSOPHY, THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE ALIGNS WITH THE REAL FREEDOM OF EVERYONE, BUT IN HAYEK'S PHILOSOPHY, IT IS A HINDRANCE.
492	RECENT CROSS-NATIONAL STUDIES OF THE INSTITUTIONAL PREREQUISITES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE IDENTIFIED COMMON LAW SYSTEMS AS SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF CIVIL LAW. THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT ALL COMMON LAW SYSTEMS SHARE A SIMILARITY OF STRUCTURE AND LAW WHICH CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT FACILITATING INVESTMENT AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT. YET, DUE TO ITS EVOLUTIONARY NATURE, COMMON LAW IS NOT EVERYWHERE THE SAME, NOR IS THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMON LAW SIMILAR IN ALL COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER MAKES THIS POINT BY EXAMINING THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF COMMON LAW IN INDIA AND KENYA, IN ORDER TO COMPARE THEIR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND HISTORIES. BOTH OF THESE COUNTRIES ADOPTED COMMON LAW THROUGH ITS TRANSPLANTATION IN THE CONTEXT OF COLONIAL DOMINATION RATHER THAN ORGANICALLY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES, THOUGH SHARING THE COMMON LAW, HAD VERY DIFFERENT COLONIAL EXPERIENCES OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, ONCE KENYA AND INDIA ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE, POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTED INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE APPLICATION OF LAW IN EACH COUNTRY.
493	BY THE FRANCOVICH Y FACTORTAME III DECISIONS, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE HAS INAUGURATE A NEW TYPOLOGY OF COMMUNITY LAW REMEDIES MORE INVASIVE THAN THE TRADITIONAL STATE SHAPE; THUS RAISING STRONG TENSIONS ON THE MUNICIPAL MODELS OF STATE LIABILITY. THIS CHANGE MIRRORS ONLY PARTIALLY ON ITS OWN TYPOLOGY SHAPED ON THE FAMOUS THREE BASIC CONDITIONS (PARADIGM IN THE LEGAL-GRAMMAR SENSE); IT OUTLINES A NEW WAY TO CONCEIVE LAW AND SOCIETY, NOT ONLY BASED UPON THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTION OF THE STATE AND ITS INSTITUTIONS, AS THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENT (PARADIGM IN THE META-LEGAL SENSE). THE PRINCIPLE OF STATE LIABILITY WAS INSERTED IN THE LEGAL SCENARIO NOT BY MEANS OF A "CONSTITUTIONAL" CHOICE, BUT BY THE DISCURSIVE METHOD WHOSE POWER RESTS ON THE ABILITY OF CONVINCING NATIONAL JUDGES. WHEREAS THE DOCTRINAL IMPULSE PROVOKES THE COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL LAW AWAKENING ("EPPUR SI MUOVE!" IN THE FAMOUS GALILEO EXCLAMATION), IT HAS ALSO DRAWN THE "SCHEME OF THE CRISIS" OF THE OLD PARADIGMS. THE PROCESS OF CROSS-FERTILISATION BASES ON THE "BREACH SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUSLY" THAT KEEPS A SIGNIFICANT ANALOGY WITH THE CONCEPT OF FRENCH FAUTE ADMINISTRATIVE INCLUDING FAUTE LOURDE AND FAUTE SIMPLE. IT IS THE RESULT OF AN ESSENTIAL COMPARISON FROM THE NATIONAL SYSTEMS TO THE ECJ. THE NATIONAL SYSTEMS GRADUALLY COME CLOSER TO THIS STATE LIABILITY PARADIGM, ALTHOUGH WITH REMARKABLE RESISTANCES. THIS IS THE DESCENDANT PHASE OF THE CROSS-FERTILISATION PHENOMENON. THE PLURALITY OF CULTURAL CONCEPTIONS OF FAULT AND STATE LIABILITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY A STRONG PROTECTION OF THE MUNICIPAL MENTALITES, BUT ON THE CONTRARY HAS TO CONTRIBUTE TO DISCOVER THE SEVERAL GRAMMATICAL ENDINGS OF THE CULTURAL PARADIGM: THE COMMUNITY TORT "AS AN HYBRID OF COMMUNITY AND NATIONAL RULES"
494	REJECTING ALL KNOWLEDGE CLAIMS CONCERNING RIGHT AND WRONG IN MATTERS PRACTICAL JAMES BUCHANAN CONCURRED WITH LEGAL POSITIVISM THAT INVALID LAW CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED BY ITS SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT BUT ONLY BY AN INHERITED DEFECT IN ITS FACTUAL CREATION. BEYOND CORRECT CREATION BUCHANAN PROPOSED AS A QUASI-NATURAL LAW CONSTRAINT THAT UNANIMITY IN THE SHADOW OF INDIVIDUAL VETO POWER MUST AT LEAST BE CONCEIVABLE IF A NORM IS TO BE LAW. THE EMERGING HYBRID CONCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IS SYMPTOMATIC FOR BUCHANAN'S NEVER-ENDING BUT ULTIMATELY FUTILE EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE KANTIAN IDEALS OF INTERPERSONAL RESPECT INTO CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS WITHOUT IMPOSING THEM AS PERSONAL VALUES.
495	THIS PAPER EXPLORES SOME OF THE REASONS WHY CAPITALISM EXPERIENCES PERIODIC CRISES OF LEGITIMACY AND ASKS WHETHER RICHARD EPSTEIN'S "SIMPLE RULES" HEURISTIC CAN HELP. THE CURRENT LEGITIMACY PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALSO IN A LOW GROWTH SITUATION. THIS MEANS THAT SOME POLICY INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO INCREASE LEGITIMACY MAY NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE. THE "SIMPLE RULES" HEURISTIC CAN HELP AS A GUIDE TO REFORMS THAT WOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THE LEGITIMACY PROBLEM, WHILE AVOIDING MAKING THE GROWTH PROBLEM WORSE.
496	"POPULISM" APPEARS EVERYWHERE: A FREQUENTLY PROFFERED ASSESSMENT-OR PERHAPS DIAGNOSIS-OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD. BOTH ITS SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS EMPHASISE ITS NEWNESS. BUT ITS PHISIOGNOMY, CAUSES, AND IMPACT ON LEGAL ORDERS AND INSTITUTIONS ARE A MATTER OF DEEP CONTROVERSY. IN A FEW WORDS, ITS CONTOURS AND CORE COMPONENTS ADAPT TO DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. POPULIST FORCES BACK A VARIETY OF AGENDAS, WHICH OFTEN OVERLAP IN A MORE RHETORICALLY THAN CONCRETE WAY.THE AUTHORS OF THIS ISSUE DIVIDE THEMSELVES AMONG OPPONENTS TO POPULISM AND MODERATELY OPTIMISTIC OBSERVERS. IN THIS RESPECT, POPULISM HAS PROBABLY BECOME A CATALYST BOTH FOR ITS SUPPORTERS AND DETRACTORS. POPULISM IDENTIFIES THROUGH IDEAS THAT RALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF DISCONTENTS. BUT ALSO OPPONENTS IDENTIFY AS POPULISTS THE PERCEIVED THREATS TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AS THEY UNDERSTAND THEM.DEFINING POPULISM HAS NOT SIMPLY PROVEN TO BE A SYSYPHEAN TASK; IT HAS ALSO SHOWED THAT IT IS ALL BUT EASY TO PIN DOWN WHAT A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IS MADE OF. CONTEMPORARY DEBATES ABOUT THE FATE OF DEMOCRACY NEED TO ABANDON METAPHYSICS FOR A MORE REALISTIC, DOWN-TO-EARTH APPROACH THAT IS SENSITIVE OF THE SPECIFICITIES OF EACH CONSTITUTIONAL SETTING.
497	HOW DOES THE CHINESE STATE MAINTAIN ITS LEGITIMACY AND MANAGE LABOR CONFLICTS DURING ITS TRANSITION TO MARKET ECONOMY? THROUGH DETAILED ANALYSIS OF A 10-YEAR STRUGGLE BY A GROUP OF STATE WORKERS TO DEFEND THEIR PENSIONS BY ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH STATE AGENTS, THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE THE CIRCULAR FEATURE OF THE STATE AND HOW THIS CIRCULAR STATE FUNCTIONS TO ABSORB THE LABOR CONTENTIONS. THIS STATE IS COMPOSED OF THREE INTERSECTING CIRCLESA CIRCLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PETITION OFFICES, A CIRCLE BETWEEN PETITION OFFICES AND COURTS, AND A CIRCLE BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND THE CENTER. ON THE ONE HAND, THE CIRCULATION OF THE WORKERS' CASE IN THIS CIRCULAR BUREAUCRATIC FIELD ELONGATES THE STRUGGLES OF THE WORKERS AND PREVENTS THE RADICALIZATION OF THEIR RESISTANCE; ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS CIRCLE PROMOTES THE CIRCULATION AND INCULCATION OF STATIST CAPITALS AMONG WORKERS. THIS PROCESS REALIZES BOTH THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW STATE AND THE SYMBOLIC DOMINATION OF THE RESISTING WORKERS.
498	THE LEGAL ORDER IS NOT THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM AND CANNOT BE SELF-SUSTAINED; WE MUST RELY MAINLY ON OFFICIALS WHO SUSTAIN IT. THE PAPER GIVES THE BASIC DESCRIPTIVE ELEMENTS OF EMPLOYEE DISCRETION AND SHOWS ITS MODUS OPERANDI IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. EMPLOYEE DISCRETION AS THE MIXTURE OF CARE, GENERALISATION AND LEGAL PROTECTION IS ONE OF THE LEGAL STATE'S CORNERSTONES AND REPRESENTS THE CONSTANT SOURCE OF ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE LATTER'S STRUCTURE AND THE QUALITY OF (EACH) GOVERNMENT. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF BEHAVIOUR OF COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEE DISCRETION CAN BE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED, WHILE FOR ITS BETTER PREDICTION, DIGITAL-ERA GOVERNANCE IS NEEDED IN CONNECTION WITH CO-PRODUCTION. THE PAPER GIVES THROUGH THE ELABORATION OF EMPLOYEE DISCRETION THE ADDITIONAL ARGUMENT FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF CO-PRODUCTION AND BASED ON THAT GIVES FUTURE PATHS ALSO FOR LEGAL SCIENCE.
499	THE SOCIAL STATE RECOGNIZES THE PRIMACY OF LAW AND INALIENABLE RIGHTS GUARANTEES, AN AREA IN WHICH NO DEROGATION IS DEVELOPED RATIONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED BY THE CONSTITUTION AS "POLITICAL HERITAGE" OF THEIR OWNERS. THESE GUARANTORS OF HUMAN DIGNITY ARE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT ARE FIRST, PRIORITY AND MAIN FEATURES WHICH MAKE THEM FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL OTHERS IN ITS SCOPE AND IRREDUCIBLE TO OTHER GENERAL STATEMENTS. THEY ARE THE SOURCE AND FOUNDATION OF THE RULES AND ORDER, THE CAUSE OF POSITIVE LAW. MEET THEM - THE PRINCIPLES - WHILE LEGITIMIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS OF THAT STATE, BECAUSE THEY MEAN THE BUDGETS OF CONSENSUS ON WHICH TO BUILD A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. COLOMBIA, AS INDICATED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN ITS FIRST ARTICLE IS A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, ITS PRINCIPLES MUST THEREFORE BE AIMED AT PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE ITSELF. WITH THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM, THE CONSTITUTION, IT OPENS THE DOORS TO THE BLOCK TO MAKE MORE EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND GUARANTEES IN THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, WHICH INDICATES THAT CONTRIBUTE NOT ONLY TO THE INTERPRETATION, SCOPE AND APPLICATION THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT BUT DETERMINED THE FUNCTIONAL EXISTENCE OF PROCEDURAL RULES AND IN TURN THIS ORDINANCE, IS REQUIRED TO FULFILL THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, ESPECIALLY IN EXERCISE REGULATORY POWER OF THE PUNITIVE POWER OF THE STATE, MAINLY THROUGH THE GREAT GUIDING PRINCIPLE INSPIRATION OF THIS ARTICLE, DUE PROCESS. DUE PROCESS, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT UNDER ARTICLE 29 OF THE CONSTITUTION, UPDATES CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PREVAILING HUMAN DIGNITY BEFORE ANY OTHER ALLOCATION THAT IS GRANTED TO STATE THEIR PRINCIPLES BEING PROTECTED; BECAUSE A PROCESS CAN NOT FULFILL ITS MISSION OF RECOGNIZING THE RIGHTS ENSHRINED IN THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW, BUT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO CONFORM TO SUCH WARRANTIES AS A REALITY RATHER THAN A SIMPLE STATEMENT. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS ARTICLE I WILL REFER TO DUE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND THAT THIS ASPECT IS THE MOST FEEL VULNERABLE CITIZENS IN THEIR LEGAL TASK, ESPECIALLY ITS APPLICATION WITH THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AS A TOOL FOR OVERCOME THE CHAOS THAT IS OCCURRING IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND NOT CAUSE A DIVORCE BETWEEN THE PROVISIONS OF CURRENT REGULATIONS FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DUE PROCESS AND REALITY.
500	THE PRESENTE ARTICLE INTENTS TO ESTABLISH SOME INDICATIVE POLITICAL BASIS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED STATE DEMOCRATIC INTERVENTION, SUITABLE TO A EMERGENT COUNTRY, TO FACE UP THE CRIMINALITY PROBLEM, FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL SOCIETY PROJECT, STATE AND LAW APPROVED IN 1988.
501	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LON FULLER'S THEORY OF LAW AND LUIGI FERRAJOLI'S LEGAL GUARANTEEISM. IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT FULLER'S PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND FERRAJOLI'S PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL GUARANTEEISM SHARE THE SAME GROUNDS. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE LATTER CAN BE READ IN THE LIGHT OF THE FORMER. HOWEVER, THAT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT PRINCIPLES OF GUARANTEEISM HAVE A CONSTITUTIVE DIMENSION OF CRIMINAL LAW THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT FERRAJOLI ATTRIBUTED TO THEM. SIGNIFICANT RUPTURES OF AND EXCEPTIONS TO PRINCIPLES SUCH AS LIABILITY, PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, THE EXCLUSIVE SUBMISSION OF THE JUDGE TO THE LAW, ETC., GIVE RISE NOT TO ILLIBERAL OR AUTHORITARIAN INSTANCES OF CRIMINAL LAW, AS FERRAJOLI ARGUED, BUT TO A SORT OF NON-LEGAL INSTANCE OF SOCIAL CONTROL INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FORM LAW.
502	THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF REEDUCATION-THROUGH-LABOR (LAOJIAO) AS A FORM OF ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENT IN CHINA IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL JUNCTURES, EVENTS, AND ACTORS THAT HAVE PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRACTICE OVER TIME. FOCUSING MOST OF ITS ATTENTION ON THE ABOLITION OF THE RTL SYSTEM ANNOUNCED IN THE THIRD PLENUM DECISION OF 2013 AND THE SUBSEQUENT USE OF A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS TO HOUSE FORMER RTL DETAINEES, IT OUTLINES A SHIFT TOWARD MORE DIVERSE AND DIFFERENTIATED MEANS OF ADDRESSING BOTH POLITICAL OPPOSITION AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN CHINA. IN MAKING THIS CLAIM, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW APPROACH OF AUTHORITARIAN CONTROL OVER THE LEGAL SYSTEM, ONE CAPABLE OF HANDLING A WIDER ASSORTMENT OF OFFENDER-TYPES AND THEREFORE BETTER-ABLE TO PROTECT CCP HEGEMONY.
503	ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IS GENERALLY SEEN AS A COMPONENT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. WHILE THE FORMER HAS DEVELOPED IN NIGERIA LARGELY THROUGH THE COMMON LAW, THE LATTER IS A RELATIVELY EMERGING IDEAL THAT HAS ELUDED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA. FOR DECADES, CORRUPTION AND MALADMINISTRATION HAVE BECOME THE CENTRAL PROBLEMS FACING THE COUNTRY. THE PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED AND ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF POOR GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE AS AN ELEMENT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN NIGERIA. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE PROBLEMS ARE THE RESULTS OF MISUSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS. ALTHOUGH EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS THROUGH LEGAL AND INTITUTIONAL REFORMS, HOWEVER, THE PROBLEMS STILL PERSIST. USING THESE TWIN CONCEPTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THEY FAILED TO APPROACH THE PROBLEMS FROM THE 'INSIDE-OUT'. THE ARTICLE PARTLY ATTRIBUTES THE FAILURE OF THE REFORMS TO THE RESTRICTIVE APPROACH IN ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE, A 'TOP-BOTTOM' APPROACH BEQUETHED BY THE COMMON LAW AND INCORPORATED INTO THE GENERAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. WHILE ADVOCATING FOR A 'BOTTOM-UP' APPROACH WHICH CONSTRAINS THE EXERCISE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AT ALL LEVELS, FROM THE INDIVIDUAL 'STREET LEVEL BUREAUCRAT' TO THE TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF CHECKS AND BALANCE, OPPENNESS, TRANSPERANCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN DECISION-TAKING SUCH THAT OFFICIAL DISCRETION MAY BE REASONABLY CONSTRAINED WITHOUT JEOPARDISING ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY.
504	CONFLICTS OVER RURAL LAND EXPROPRIATION, WHICH HAVE INTENSIFIED OVER THE PAST DECADE IN CHINA, POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE COUNTRY'S SOCIAL STABILITY AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH CONFLICTS ARE INEVITABLE UNDER CHINA'S CURRENT POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM. AFTER A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE PRESENT SITUATION IN CHINA AND AN OVERVIEW OF CHINA'S LAND REGIME, THE ARTICLE FIRST ANALYZES REASONS FOR THE ESCALATION OF LAND CONFLICTS, INCLUDING THE VAGUE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC INTEREST, THE INADEQUATE COMPENSATION, AND THE AMBIGUOUS NATURE OF COLLECTIVE LAND OWNERSHIP. IT THEN ARGUES THAT EVEN THE FEW EXISTING RIGHTS OF RURAL PEASANTS UNDER THE PRESENT LAND REGIME ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTED DUE TO CHINA'S POOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ELUCIDATES THAT IMPUNITY WITH REGARD TO ILLEGAL LAND GRABBING IS COMMON IN CHINA FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT ALL HAVE ROOTS IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S MONOPOLY OVER CHINESE SOCIETY. WITH NO FUNDAMENTAL REFORM TO CHINA'S PARTY POLITICS, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES, THERE WILL BE NO EFFECTIVE MEASURE TO PREVENT FURTHER CONFLICTS OVER LAND IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
505	WHAT HAPPENS TO A PUBLIC, DOMESTIC INSTITUTION WHEN ITS AUTHORITY IS DELEGATED TO A PRIVATELY RUN, TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTION? I ARGUE THAT OUTSOURCING TRADITIONALLY NATIONAL LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRANSNATIONAL BODIES CAN LEAD TO THE STAGNATION OF DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. I EXAMINE THIS THROUGH A STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION (ICA), A WIDELY USED SYSTEM OF CROSS-BORDER COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. I ARGUE THAT ICA PROVIDES COMMERCIAL ACTORS AN "EXIT OPTION" FROM WEAK PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, REDUCING PRESSURE ON THE STATE TO INVEST IN CAPACITY-ENHANCING REFORM. I FIND THAT THE ENACTMENT OF STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR ICA LEADS TO THE GRADUAL EROSION OF THE CAPACITY OF DOMESTIC LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WITH ALREADY WEAK LEGAL SYSTEMS. I TEST THE MECHANISM DRIVING THIS DYNAMIC USING DISPUTE DATA FROM THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. I FIND THAT PRO-ARBITRATION LAWS INCREASE THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION BY NATIONAL FIRMS, SUGGESTING THAT FIRMS USE ICA AS AN ESCAPE FROM DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO DEBATES ON GLOBALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS WORK ON THE SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS.
506	THE CONSTITUTION OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC WAS PROGRESSIVE AND PROMISINNG IN MANY RESPECTS. HOWEVER, IT ESTABLISHED PARLIAMENTARISM ONLY HALF WAY, WITH A PARLIAMENTARY RIGHT TO OVERTROW GOVERNMENT, BUT WITH THE RIGHT TO SELECT AND APPOINT THE CHANCELLOR IN THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT, WHO COULD ALSO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT AT WISH, AND HAD EXTENSIVE EMERGENCY POWERS. THE DEMERITS OF THAT DESIGN, FOR WHICH HUGO PREUSS, THE DRAFTER OF THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION, HAD RELIED ON A THEORY OF PARLIAMENTARISM DEVELOPED BY THE ALSATIAN JURIST ROBERT REDSLOB, CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENTUAL FAILURE OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHEREAS THE OFT-BLAMED INSTRUMENTS OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY DID NOT. THE MAIN REASONS WHY THE FIRST GEMAN DEMOCRACY FAILED ARE FULLY EXTERNAL TO THE CONSTITUTION.
507	COMBINING THE INSIGHTS OF EU-SPECIFIC RESEARCH ON BACKSLIDING AND COALITIONS WITH THE LITERATURE ON THE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION OF AUTOCRATS, WE ARGUE THAT RIGHT-WING POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN HUNGARY AND POLAND HAVE COALESCED TO ADVANCE THEIR RESPECTIVE PROJECTS OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. WE IDENTIFY THREE DISTINCT BUT INTERTWINED USES OF THE COALITION: (1) MUTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED WITHIN THE SUPRANATIONAL ARENA AIMED AT LIMITING THE EU'S SANCTIONING CAPACITIES; (2) LEARNING IN THE FORM OF TRANSFER OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING POLICIES; AND (3) DOMESTIC LEGITIMATION. THREE FACTORS HAVE DRIVEN COALESCENCE PATTERNS: INTERSECTING INTERESTS, IDEOLOGICAL PROXIMITY, AND THE EU'S DECISION RULES REGARDING SANCTIONS.
508	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WHILE THE JURORS' ACQUITTAL OF THE FAMOUS TERRORIST VERA ZASULICH HAS OFTEN BEEN INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF SYMPATHY FOR 'A DESPERATE GIRL, PREVIOUSLY UNDERESTIMATED LEGAL AND POLITICAL CLAIMS ALSO PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE TRIAL. THE KEY LEGAL EXPERTS AT THE TRIAL - HER DEFENSE ATTORNEY ALEKSANDROV AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT KONI - INTERPRETED ZASULICH'S ATTEMPT ON TREPOV'S LIFE AS AN ACT OF SOCIETAL SELF-DEFENSE: ZASULICH WAS PRESENTED AS A VICTIM OF A SOCIETY WHICH COULD NO LONGER TOLERATE ARBITRARINESS BY AUTHORITIES. THE FLOGGING OF POLITICAL PRISONER BOGOLYUBOV FOLLOWING TREPOV'S ILLEGAL ORDER MADE ZASULICH DESPERATE TO TAKE REVENGE IN ORDER TO ALERT RUSSIAN SOCIETY OF THE HUMILIATING ARBITRARINESS AND THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRUCTURES OF LATE IMPERIAL RUSSIA. HER VICTIMIZATION HIGHLIGHTED HER "MORAL RIGHT" TO ACT AS A DEFENDANT OF TRUE LAW AND LEGALITY IN RUSSIA. THIS IDEA OF "MORAL RIGHT," WHICH EMPOWERED ZASULICH TO ACT IN DEFENSE OF SOCIETY, WAS SUPPORTED BY KONI'S CONCEPTUALIZATION OF LAW AND STATE POWER AS AN EMBODIMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S WILL AND RESPONSIBILITY THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION WAS ELABORATED IN DETAIL IN HIS SCHOLARLY LEGAL WRITINGS SCHOLARSHIP ON THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. THE ARTICLE BRINGS TOGETHER KONI'S THEORY AND HIS PRACTICAL ROLE IN ZASULICH'S ACQUITTAL AND DEMONSTRATES TENSIONS BETWEEN THE GREAT REFORMS AND THEIR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIMITATIONS.
509	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO STUDY THE LEGAL ASPECTS OFTHE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THERESEARCH METHODOLOGY INCLUDED THE USE OF GENERAL AND SPECIALSCIENTIFIC METHODS OF KNOWLEDGE, SUCH AS: DIALECTIC, HISTORICAL-LEGAL,FORMAL-LOGICAL, HERMENEUTICS, GENERALIZATION AND COMPARISON. ITSHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIEDFOUR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES WITH AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES(EL SALVADOR, CUBA, NICARAGUA AND VENEZUELA). THE LEGAL ASPECTS OFTHE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME OF EACH SELECTED COUNTRY WERE CONSIDERED. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT AREAS OF ANALYSIS WERE COVERED AND CHARACTERIZED IN THE COURSE OF THE WORK: (GOVERNMENT, PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, LEGISLATION AND PRISONERS' RIGHTS). IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES HAS COMMON LEGAL ASPECTS OF AUTHORITARIANISM, INCLUDING THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT OR GOVERNMENT, CONTROL OF THE JUDICIARY AND LEGISLATURE, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF DYNAMICSOF CORRUPTION AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
510	IT IS WIDELY REGARDED AS ILLEGITIMATE FOR LEGAL SYSTEMS TO RETROACTIVELY ALTER THE SENTENCES ASSIGNED BY THE COURTS TO OFFENDERS ONCE THOSE SENTENCES HAVE BECOME FINAL. SUCH RETROACTIVE CHANGES ARE DEEMED TO VIOLATE 'FAIR NOTICE' REQUIREMENTS AND TO UNREASONABLY UPSET THE EXPECTATIONS OF SENTENCED OFFENDERS. YET IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH RETROACTIVE SENTENCING CHANGES FROM RETROACTIVE CHANGES TO LEGAL PROHIBITIONS. I CONTEND THAT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE FORMER ARE MUCH LESS CONVINCING THAN THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE LATTER, ESPECIALLY WHEN RETROACTIVE SENTENCING CHANGES WOULD BRING SENTENCES MORE IN LINE WITH PROPORTIONALITY CONSTRAINTS. THE MORE CONVINCING ARGUMENTS AGAINST RETROACTIVE SENTENCING CHANGES ARE PRACTICAL ONES; THEY WOULD UPSET NEGOTIATED PLEAS AND CONFOUND THE SENTENCING OF REPEAT AND MULTIPLE OFFENDERS.
511	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN INTERPRETATION OF VLADIMIR NABOKOV'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO POLITICAL THEORY AS SEEN PRIMARILY THROUGH THE LENS OF HIS NOVEL INVITATION TO A BEHEADING. ALTHOUGH MOST FREQUENTLY INTERPRETED AS AN INDICTMENT OF TOTALITARIANISM, THE NOVEL DEPICTS A FORM OF CRUELTY PRACTICED NOT ONLY BY TOTALITARIANS, BUT ALSO BY THE RULERS AND CITIZENS OF MILDER POLITICAL ORDERS, INCLUDING LIBERALISM. THE NOVEL SUGGESTS THAT SUCH CRUELTY IS MORE INSIDIOUS THAN THAT FAMILIAR TO READERS OF DYSTOPIAN NOVELS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF ITS UNIVERSALITY. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT NABOKOV'S CONTRIBUTION TO LIBERALISM MAY BE FOUND IN THE SURPRISING COHERENCE BETWEEN HIS AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES AND HIS ART, BOTH OF WHICH CRITIQUE THE IMPOSITION OF GENERAL IDEAS ON EITHER PERSONS OR BOOKS. WHAT EMERGES IS A PICTURE OF AESTHETIC LIBERALISM IN WHICH NABOKOV'S MODEL FOR THE IDEAL LIBERAL CITIZEN IS NEITHER THE SENSITIVE ARTIST NOR THE APOLITICAL AESTHETE, BUT RATHER THE CAREFUL READER.
512	IN FRANCE THE CRITICAL LITERATURE ON DEMOCRACY IS IN BOTH RICH AND LONG LASTING. MUCH OF THIS LITERATURE FOCUSES NOT ON DEMOCRACY AS A REGIME, BUT ON DEMOCRACY AS A FORM OF SOCIETY. ON SUCH AN ISSUE DOMINIQUE SCHAPPER'S LAST BOOK, L'ESPRIT DEMOCRATIQUE DES LOIS, MUST BE CONSIDERED AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, THE CURRENT CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY IS NOT PROVOKED NOT SO MUCH BY ITS MISSING ACHIEVEMENTS, BUT BY ITS SAME PHILOSOPHICAL PREMISES PUSHING THE HOMO DEMOCRATICUS TO INCREASE ALWAYS HIS EXPECTATIONS.
513	THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS IN WHAT SENSE SOLIDARITY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN ESSENTIAL VALUE AT THE FOUNDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, FIRSTLY, BY CONTRASTING THE VIEW THAT IT IS A VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL ETHICS WITH ITS UNDERSTANDING AS A VALUE OF PUBLIC ETHICS; AND THEN, BY CONTRASTING THE PREDOMINANT NEOLIBERAL ASSUMPTIONS IN OUR SOCIETY WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOLIDARITY AS AN ESSENTIAL VALUE AT THE FOUNDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THUS, IT CONCLUDES WITH THE NEED TO ATTEND TO THE BALANCE THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO EXIST BETWEEN THE VALUES OF THE PUBLIC ETHICS OF MODERNITY.
514	THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW THE CJEU HAS DEVELOPED A NEW INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 19.1 TEU, THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ASSERT HIS JURISDICTION OVER NATIONAL LEGISLATION ON JUDICIAL MATTERS. ACCORDING TO THIS GROUND-BREAKING CASE-LAW, JUDICIAL MATTERS FALL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT ONLY REFER TO NATIONAL JUDGES, BUT ALSO TO EUROPEAN JUDGES. IN ADDITION, THE CJEU HAS GONE ONE STEP FURTHER BY STARTING TO DELINEATE AND DEVELOP THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN JUDICIARY, IN WHICH THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE.
515	INTERNAL PARTY RIFTS IN THE NEPALI GOVERNMENT PREOCCUPIED LEADERS, WHO SQUANDERED OPPORTUNITIES TO PREPARE A COHERENT RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE PANDEMIC RESULTED IN A FOUR-MONTH LOCKDOWN, WITH WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO CRITICISM WAS TO PROPOSE LEGISLATION RESTRICTING CITIZENS' RIGHTS, PROMPTING ACCUSATIONS OF CREEPING AUTHORITARIANISM. CONTINUED TENSIONS ALONG NEPAL'S BORDERS LED TO ESCALATED RHETORIC. THE CRISES OF 2020 EXACERBATED EXISTING PROBLEMS WITH GOVERNANCE, SOCIAL INEQUALITY, AND POVERTY.
516	THIS COMMENTARY DISCUSSES THE DECISION IN R (NICKLINSON) V MINISTRY OF JUSTICE;(1) IT WILL ARGUE THAT THE COURT SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE USE OF THE DEFENCE OF NECESSITY. IT ARGUES THAT THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE OF THE LAW SHOULD BE TO OUTLAW EUTHANASIA OR ASSISTED SUICIDE, BUT ALSO TO RECOGNISE THAT IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THESE SHOULD BE PERMITTED. THE USE OF THE DEFENCE OF NECESSITY PERMITS THIS NUANCED RESPONSE TO THE ISSUE. THE COMMENTARY ALSO ARGUES THAT THE TREATMENT OF SUICIDAL AND ELDERLY PEOPLE IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAN CREATING THE CORRECT LEGAL RESPONSE TO ASSISTED DYING.
517	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE MAIN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN HAITI IN THE LAST 22 MONTHS. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE COUNTRY HAS ATTAINED SOME DEGREE OF POLITICAL STABILITY AS A RESULT OF THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF AN ELECTORAL PROCESS AND THE CONCOMITANT ELECTION OF RENE PREVAL AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY. HAITI, FURTHERMORE, HAS SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY TRIGGERED BY A MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN PARTLY POSSIBLE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS STABILIZATION MISSION IN HAITI (MINUSTAH), WHICH, JOINTLY WITH THE HAITIAN STATE, HAVE WORKED TO TACKLE ACUTE PROBLEMS, IN PARTICULAR LACK OF SECURITY. THESE IMPROVEMENTS NOTWITHSTANDING, THE GENERAL OUTLOOK OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS POLITICAL STABILITY REMAIN FRAGILE GIVEN ITS SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS AND ITS EXTENSIVE DEPENDENCE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
518	WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF BANK FINANCING ON REGIONAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES IN CHINA. WE PRESENT CONTRASTING FINDINGS ON THE ROLE OF QUANTITY VS. QUALITY OF BANK FINANCING ON SMALL BUSINESS FORMATION IN CHINA: WHILE WE DOCUMENT A CONSISTENT, SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF BANK FINANCING AND NEW VENTURE FORMATION, WE FIND THAT THE QUANTITY OF SUPPLIED CREDIT IS INSIGNIFICANT. WE REPORT THAT FORMAL INSTITUTIONS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO REGIONAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS SUBSTITUTE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR FINDINGS ALSO REVEAL THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT TENDS TO SUPPLEMENT BANK FINANCING IN PROMOTING REGIONAL ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES.
519	WHILE RECOGNIZING THE HEURISTIC LIMITS OF THE CONCEPT "DEMOCRATIC QUALITY" THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MEASURING DEMOCRACY OVER TIME IS THE MOST ADEQUATE WAY TO IDENTIFY, DISCUSS AND ANALYZE ITS PRESENCE IN EVERY COUNTRY. "DEMOCRATIC QUALITY" SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON BOTH CONCEPT ELABORATION AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES BECAUSE IT SYNTHETIZES TWO POLITICAL PROCESSES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE REGION IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS: DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. THIS CATEGORY ALLOWS US TO DEFINE THE CURRENT STATE OF LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF THEIR INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC LIFE. WE CAN THUS, AT LEAST IN THEORY, OBSERVE AND PROPOSE AN INTEGRATED IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING POLITICAL REGIMES IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH MODERN REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACIES ARE REORGANIZED IN TERMS OF THEIR NEW ATTRIBUTES AND RIGHTS. BASED ON THESE PREMISES, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TWO INTERRELATED PATHS OF ANALYSIS: A) CONSIDERING THE MODEL OF "DEMOCRATIC QUALITY" TO ANALYZE LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES AND CHARACTERIZE THEIR PRESENT PROBLEMS; AND B) EXAMINING THE RELEVANCE OF THIS MODEL'S HEURISTIC POWER. THE MAIN THESIS HOLDS THAT NOT EVEN THE MOST VISIBLE LONG OR SHORT- TERM TRANSFORMATIONS UNDERGONE BY OUR DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL LEGAL CODES, SINCE ITS INCEPTION, ARE SUFFCIENT IN AND OF THEMSELVES TO BRING US CLOSER TO THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY MODEL, OR IN OTHER WORDS, TO THE BASIS OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW.
520	IUS-RATIONAL THINKING ON WHICH IS BASED THE RECOGNITION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF 1812 CONFLICTED WITH ROUSSEAU'S CONCEPT OF LAW, EXPRESSED IN ART. 4 OF CADIZ CONSTITUTION. INDEED, FROM THE IUS-RATIONAL STANDPOINT, WERE NOT APPLICABLE TO LAWS THAT SHOULD "PRESERVE" THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS, THE VALIDITY CRITERION OF CONVENIENCE OR UTILITY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD ACCORDING TO GENERAL WILL, AS ALL OTHER LAWS, BUT THE UNAVAILABLE AND IRREDUCIBLE CONTENT OF EACH RIGHT PREFIXED TO LEGISLATOR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LAW, AS SUCH, COULD NOT BE UNFAIR FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF LEGITIMACY, SINCE NEITHER IN ITS ORIGIN -COMING FROM A STIPULATED CONSENT-EITHER IN ITS NATURE -BECAUSE IS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENACTED ON THEMSELVES-, IT COULD NOT BE SAID THAT A LAW COULD BE UNJUST, "SINCE NO ONE IS WRONG ABOUT HIMSELF." IF THE LAW WAS PRESENTED AS A NORM WHICH COMMANDS AND PROHIBITIONS ARE FAIR, GIVEN THEIR FORMAL, PROCEDURAL AND MATERIAL ATTRIBUTES, WHAT SENSE MIGHT HAVE TO REQUIRE IN ADDITION THAT THE LAWS HAD TO BE WISE AND JUST? THE ANSWER IS THAT AGAINST THE SUBJECTIVISM OF ROUSSEAU'S VOLUNTARIST CONTRACTUALISM LINKED TO THE CONCEPT OF LAW, STOOD THE RATIONALIST POSITIVISM OF A RIGID CONSTITUTION. THIS OPPOSITION IS WHAT ARTICLE 4 OF CADIZ CONSTITUTION WAS TRYING TO SOLVE, BY MEANS OF TRY CONCILIATION BETWEEN WHAT IS DUE ACCORDING TO MORAL JUSTICE AND WHAT IS GOOD AS CONVENIENT OR USEFUL.
521	WHAT USE (IF ANY) MAY BE MADE OF SETTLED PRACTICE IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION AND WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ITS USE? DEBATE ABOUT THE USE OF SETTLED PRACTICE IS OFTEN FRAMED IN TERMS OF A TENSION BETWEEN LEGAL CERTAINTY, ON THE ONE HAND, AND LEGAL CORRECTNESS IN GIVING EFFECT TO PARLIAMENT'S WILL, ON THE OTHER. THAT ACCOUNT PRESENTS A FALSE CHOICE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE USE OF SETTLED PRACTICE AND ARGUES THAT IT HAS A LEGITIMATE ROLE TO PLAY IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION AND ONE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PREVAILING APPROACH OF THE COURTS TO STATUTORY INTERPRETATION.
522	THE RULING ELITE OF ARMENIA, STRONGLY ATTACHED TO ITS SOVIET RECENT PAST, BEGAN THE LONG AND DIFFICULT TRANSITION TOWARDS A DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY REGIME. THE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS ADVANCED QUITE DIFFICULTLY, AS OLD TOTALITARIAN MENTALITIES REPRESENTED A REAL OBSTACLE IN THEIR PATH. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, A CIVIL SOCIETY BEGAN TO DEVELOP, AND WESTERN DEMOCRATIC VALUES STARTED TO PERMEATE ARMENIA. THIS PROCESS CHANGED THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SOCIETY, GENERATING IN THE EARLY 2000S A STRONG CONFRONTATION BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NEO-COMMUNIST NOMENKLATURA, ON ONE SIDE, AND THOSE OF DEMOCRATIC FORCES AND CIVIL SOCIETY, ON THE OTHER. THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES OF PRESIDENTS ROBERT KOCHARIAN AND SERZH SARGSYAN HELD ARMENIA CAPTIVE UNTIL 2018. FORMER PRESIDENT SARGSYAN'S LATEST ATTEMPT TO EXTEND HIS POWER, FOLLOWING PUTIN'S MODEL, BY TAKING OVER THE POSITION OF THE PRIME MINISTER, CAUSED A HUGE WAVE OF DISCONTENT. AT THE HEAD OF THOSE SOCIAL MOVEMENTS WAS THE PUBLICIST AND POLITICIAN NIKOL PASHINYAN, UNDER WHOSE LEADERSHIP A REAL "VELVET REVOLUTION" TOOK PLACE IN ARMENIA, WHICH LED TO THE OUSTING OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TO EARLY PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS AND, FINALLY, TO A TRULY DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REGIME, OPEN TO REFORMS AND TO THE MODERNIZATION OF THE COUNTRY.
523	THERE APPEARS TO BE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLIC TOLERANCE FOR CELEBRITIES WHO MISBEHAVE AND BREAK THE LAW. THIS HAS GIVEN RISE TO CONCERNS THAT CELEBRITIES ARE BAD ROLE MODELS WHO ARE GLAMORIZING ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE WRONG TO SUGGEST THAT CELEBRITY ANTICS ARE UNIFORMLY TOLERATED AND ACCEPTED BY THE PUBLIC. THE REPUTATION OF SOME CELEBRITIES IS UNDOUBTEDLY SERIOUSLY AFFECTED WHEN THEY BREACH MORAL, LEGAL AND SOCIAL CODES, WHILE OTHER CELEBRITIES SUFFER FEW ADVERSE EFFECTS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPORTANCE OF GENDER AND CLASS IN ASCERTAINING THE LIMITS OF PERMISSIVENESS THAT APPLY TO CELEBRITY WRONGDOING. FEMALE CELEBRITIES OF A LOWER-CLASS STATUS ARE OFTEN SUBJECTED TO VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PUBLIC SCRUTINY AND PUNITIVE MEDIA COMMENTARY. THIS POINT WILL BE ILLUSTRATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE BRITISH REALITY TV STAR JADE GOODY AND HER FALL FROM GRACE FOLLOWING PUBLIC OUTCRY ABOUT HER TREATMENT OF HER CO-CONTESTANT SHILPA SHETTY ON CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER 2007.
524	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE REASONS FOR WHICH INSANE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD COMMITTED PATRICIDE WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SENTENCED TO DISMEMBERMENT (LINGCHI) UNDER THE QING DYNASTY (1644-1911), THE MOST SEVERE FORM OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THAT COULD BE CALLED FOR IN THE STATE'S ADMINISTRATIVE AND PENAL CODE. THIS EXTREME HARSHNESS RAN CONTRARY TO SEVERAL "THEORETICAL" FOUNDATIONS OF CHINESE TRADITIONAL LAW, FIRST AND FOREMOST THE PRINCIPLE OF CRIMINAL INTENT. THROUGH THE STUDY OF SUCH CRIMINAL CASES, AND OTHERS LEGALLY AFFILIATED TO PATRICIDE, SPANNING THE SEVENTEENTH TO THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, IT UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PARENT AND HIS CHILD, WHICH WAS PROMINENT IN CHINA'S MORAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT AT THE TIME. IT ALSO STRESSES THE ROLE OF POLITICAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE IMPERIAL STATE AND TO THE UPHOLDING OF THE LEGALITY OF ITS JUDICIAL PROCESS. EVEN THOUGH LEGAL TOOLS EXISTED IN THE QING CODE, WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED FOR A MORE LENIENT APPROACH, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE QING AUTHORITIES' ONGOING EFFORT AT DEFINING SPECIFIC LEGAL PROCEDURES FOR INSANE HOMICIDES, LINGCHI WAS SYSTEMATICALLY APPLIED TO INSANE PATRICIDES UNTIL THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, WHEN THE FAR-REACHING LEGAL REFORMS IMPLEMENTED DURING THE LAST YEARS OF THE IMPERIAL REGIME PROGRESSIVELY OPENED THE WAY FOR THE RECOGNITION OF THE LEGAL IRRESPONSIBILITY OF INSANE INDIVIDUALS.
525	THIS REVIEW ADDRESSES THREE QUESTIONS SURROUNDING AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY AND STATE CAPITALISM IN CHINA. FIRST, WHAT IS LEGALITY, AND DOES IT EXIST IN CHINA'S LENINIST SINGLE-PARTY STATE? SCHOLARS WHO CHARACTERIZE THE SYSTEM AS ORDER MAINTENANCE FIND THE ABSENCE OF LEGALITY. THOSE EMPLOYING DUAL-STATE AND INSTRUMENTALIST VIEWS OF LAW FIND PARTIAL LEGALITY. SCHOLARS PROMOTING THE NOTION OF BARE LEGALITY FIND COMPLETE LEGALITY. SECOND, DOES AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY STRENGTHEN REGIME LEGITIMACY? SCHOLARS AGREE THAT THE STATE SEEKS LEGITIMATION THROUGH ITS EMBRACE OF AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH TESTS THIS CLAIM. THIRD, IS CHINA IN TRANSITION FROM PLAN TO MARKET, AND WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LAW IN STATE CAPITALISM? THE TELEOLOGY OF THE TRANSITION PARADIGM OVERLOOKS ILLIBERAL UNDERPINNINGS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND FACTOR MARKETS. ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS HELP EXPLAIN REGIME RESILIENCE, ECONOMIC GROWTH, ECONOMIC CRISIS, AND INEQUALITY IN CHINA. BOTH THE INSTITUTION OF THE DUAL STATE AND THE PERPETUATION OF PLAN ELEMENTS REINFORCE STATE POWER.
526	WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE AND CONSTITUTIONAL OF LAW, REPLACING THE STATE LAW IN ITS VERSION MERELY LEGISLATIVE, MANY TRANSFORMATIONS HAVE OCCURRED. ONE OF THE MOST EVIDENT OCCURS IN THE JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY. IF BEFORE THE JUDGE WAS JUST THE MANIFESTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL, TODAY ITS PERFORMANCE SPACE HAS CHANGED. IT GAINED IN AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM OF INTERPRETATION, BUT ALWAYS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF A SINGLE DIRECTION: THE GUARANTEE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AND IN THIS SCENARIO COMES TO ITS PERFORMANCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. WITH THEIR PROTECTION ERECTED TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, NEW INSTRUMENTS WERE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THEM. AMONG THEM, THERE IS THE POLLUTER-PAYER PRINCIPLE, CLEAR EXPRESSION AND EVIDENT INTERVENTION IN THE PRIVATE SPACE IN THE NAME OF DEFENDING THE COLLECTIVE HERITAGE.
527	CHINA'S FISCAL AND TAXATION LAW REFORM IS AT A CRITICAL STAGE SINCE CHINESE ECONOMY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO CONSIDER COMPROMISING INTERESTS AND CONFLICTS FROM ALL SOURCES, SUCH AS THE SOCIAL BENEFIT NETWORK, REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AVIDITY, INTERNATIONALIZING CURRENCIES, FOSTERING A PHILANTHROPIC CULTURE, AND GROWING AS A LEADER IN THE WORLD MARKET. THESE UNDERTAKINGS ALL DEMAND A MODERN, HANDY FISCAL AND TAXATION LAW SYSTEM. ON THE OTHER HAND, AFTER TWO DECADES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 1994 TAX SHARING SYSTEM, THE ORIGINAL INITIATIVE OF STRENGTHENING CENTRALIZED CONTROL MIGHT NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE NEEDS OF BALANCING DECENTRALIZATION AND LOCAL FINANCING DEMANDS, IN ADDITION TO THE TROUBLESOME TAXPAYERS' PROTECTION, TAX JUDICATURE REFORM, AND WORSENING ENVIRONMENTAL IRREGULARITIES. ADMITTEDLY, CHINA'S FISCAL AND TAXATION LAW REFORM FACES NEW CHALLENGES AND INCENTIVES. RIGOROUS INTERNATIONAL TAX FRAMEWORKS AND MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL COOPERATION DRIVE CHINA TO RESPOND AS AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE GIANT AND A RESPONSIBLE GAME PLAYER. SUCH INTERNATIONAL TAX POLICY ORIENTATIONS CREATE ANOTHER LAYER OF INCENTIVES AND NECESSITY FOR CHINA TO FINE-TUNE ITS DOMESTIC FISCAL AND TAXATION LEGAL FRAMEWORK, RANGING FROM PROMOTION OF FREE TRADE ZONES, GLOBAL SOURCING PRACTICE AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, RENEGOTIATION OF OUTDATED TAX TREATY ARTICLES, MORE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN CONSEQUENTIAL OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS, TO WTO PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE REVIEW, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX DISPUTE RESOLUTION. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, NO MATTER THE EXTENT TO WHICH FEASIBLE, PLAUSIBLE OR PRAGMATIC PROPOSALS ARE PRESENTED, A TOP LEVEL ARCHITECTING AND A SERIOUS PURSUIT TO UPGRADE CITIZENS' LIVELIHOOD MUST BE PRIORITIZED IN EARNEST.
528	THIS ANALYSIS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW IN FIVE NEWLY DEMOCRATIZED NATIONS IN EAST ASIA SHOWS THAT DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES THE JUDICIARY HAS COME TO PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT POLITICAL ROLE IN SOUTH KOREA, TAIWAN AND INDONESIA. CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IN THESE THREE COUNTRIES ARE MORE ACTIVE IN COUNTERBALANCING EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS HOWEVER CONTRASTS WITH THE EXPERIENCES OF THAILAND AND MONGOLIA WHERE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS WERE UNABLE TO FULFILL A SIMILAR FUNCTION. THE DISCUSSION FOR POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS CROSS-NATIONAL VARIANCE IN COURT PERFORMANCE SUPPORTS THE CRITIQUE IN PARTS OF THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AGAINST PURELY INSTITUTIONAL, CULTURAL AND STRUCTURAL EXPLANATIONS. RATHER, THE DEGREE OF POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY AND DIFFUSION OF POLITICAL POWER ARE CRITICAL DETERMINANTS FOR UNDERSTANDING WHY POLITICIANS COMPLY WITH COURT JUDGMENTS, OR ATTEMPT TO MARGINALIZE JUSTICES. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, COMPLIANCE AND THE AREA OF JUDICIAL REVIEW MATTERS. IN THIS REGARD, ONE LESSON OF THE EAST ASIAN COMPARISON IS THAT A TOO EARLY INTRODUCTION OF REVIEW OF SEPARATION OF POWER CONFLICTS COULD ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS WORSE, BY THREATENING THE COURT'S AUTHORITY AND MARGINALIZING ITS INFLUENCE. THIS REPRESENTS A DANGER OFTEN NEGLECTED IN THE DEMOCRATIZATION LITERATURE THAT CLAIMS JUDICIAL CONTROL OF HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS WOULD NECESSARILY HELP TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY.
529	THE DARK SIDE OF THE CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES (NTR) IS THE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS (CO2) RESULTING FROM THE EXTRACTION OF NTR AS WELL AS THE INCREASING LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE ECONOMY. BESIDES, THE MASSIVE EXPANSION AND GROWTH OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAVE ALSO MEANT ITS CO2 IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, THUS MAKING CHINA ONE OF THE LEADING CONTRIBUTORS TO GLOBAL WARMING. HENCE THE CURRENT STUDY FILLS A KNOWLEDGE VACUUM BY ANALYZING THE RELATIONSHIPS GOVERNING NTR AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION (TIN) IN COUNTERING THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE DUE TO CO2, BY REVISITING THE EKC IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT THROUGH "QUANTILE AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG" (QARDL). THE RESULTS VALIDATE THE EKC WHERE NTR CONSUMPTION WORSENS THE ENVIRONMENT FURTHER; HOWEVER, TIN IS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION IN COUNTERING CO2. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINDINGS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS NEED TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF NTR WITHOUT CONCEDING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND PROSPERITY.
530	AS THE IDIOM GOES, BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER. THIS ANCIENT PROVERB IS FREQUENTLY USED TO PORTRAY THE PHENOMENON OF PEOPLE ASSOCIATING WITH THOSE WITH HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS AND TASTES. HOWEVER, IN THE NAME OFWEIQUANLAWYERS, MYRIAD LAWYERS FLOCK TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENT BELIEFS AND DIVERSE VALUES. WITHIN THIS POOL OF LAWYERS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE LAWYERS WHO ARE DRIVEN BY PUBLIC INTEREST, SOME LAWYERS WHO HAVE EAGERLY LABELLED THEMSELVES ASWEIQUANLAWYERS ARE PROFIT-ORIENTED IN NATURE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROVIDE A NEW TYPOLOGY TO PRESENT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OFWEIQUANLAWYERS, BY JOINTLY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LAWYERS' MOTIVATIONS AND ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES. IN THIS REGARD,WEIQUANLAWYERS IN CHINA CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO FOUR IDEAL TYPES: ROUTINE PRACTITIONERS, RATIONAL ACTIVISTS, PROGRESSIVE REFORMERS, AND CYNICAL CRITICIZERS.
531	EXECUTIVE TERM LIMITS ARE EVIDENTLY UNDER STRESS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS. ONE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE EVADED IS THROUGH THE FORMAL REVISION OR ABROGATION OF A CONSTITUTION. SUCH A PROCESS ACCELERATES A PERNICIOUS CYCLE IN WHICH CONSTITUTIONAL NON-COMPLIANCE BEGETS CONSTITUTIONAL INSTABILITY, WHICH IN TURN BEGETS SUBSEQUENT NON-COMPLIANCE. SUCH A NON-COMPLIANCE CYCLE IS A CORE PROBLEM IN LAW, AND ONE THAT DESERVES MORE CAREFUL EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS DOMAINS. THIS ESSAY UNEARTHS ORIGINAL HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF TERM-LIMIT PROVISIONS AND EXECUTIVE TENURE IN AN EFFORT TO ILLUMINATE AND EVALUATE THE PHENOMENON. A BACKGROUND CONCERN IS THAT OF INTERNATIONAL (AND DOMESTIC) APPROACHES TO TERM-LIMIT EVASION. ONE INTELLECTUAL RESPONSE IS THAT OF MILITANT DEMOCRACY. THE LOGIC OF THAT APPROACH WOULD IMPLY THE ENTRENCHMENT AND PROTECTION OF TERM LIMITS, WHICH WOULD PRESUMABLY DISRUPT THE CYCLE OF NON-COMPLIANCE.
532	MARX'S THESES ON HUMAN RIGHTS ARE MAINLY ENCOMPASSED IN HIS YOUTH WRITINGS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE ARTICLE ON THE JUDENFRAGE OF 1844. IN THIS TEXT MARX TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE "RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITIZEN" AFFIRMED IN THE FAMOUS DOCUMENTS OF THE BOURGEOIS REVOLUTIONS. HIS MAIN THESE ARE TWO. THE FIRST IS THAT THE RIGHTS OF THE CITIZEN "EMANCIPATE", THAT IS, THEY FREE THE INDIVIDUAL FROM A STATE OF SUBMISSION, ONLY AS A PUBLIC SUBJECT. THE SECOND THESIS IS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ACTUALLY EMANCIPATE THE BOURGEOIS, ARE THOSE OF THE SELFISH INDIVIDUAL. THEREFORE, THE POLITICAL EMANCIPATION PRODUCED BY BOURGEOIS REVOLUTIONS, IS NOT HUMAN EMANCIPATION. THIS REDUCTIONIST VIEW OF THE MODERN IDEA OF RIGHTS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE MARXIAN CONCEPTION OF LAW AND POLITICS IN GENERAL. ON THESE LIMITATIONS, THE AUTHOR INVITES TO RE-READ THE ANALYZES AND CONSIDERATIONS DEVELOPED BY NORBERTO BOBBIO IN HIS LONG DIALOGUE WITH MARXIST THINKERS.
533	IN RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A GRADUAL SHIFT IN THE DANISH GOVERNMENT'S GUIDELINES REGARDING CHILDREN IN NEED OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARDS TO CHILDREN LIVING IN DENMARK ON A PROCEDURAL RESIDENCE. THIS MEANS THAT CHILDREN SEEKING ASYLUM ARE INCREASINGLY TREATED SOLELY AS A MATTER OF IMMIGRATION LAW, AND NOT AS A MATTER OF SOCIAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES AND CHALLENGES THIS POLITICAL SHIFT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, AND DEBATES WHETHER IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW.
534	WHOEVER PUNISHES IS SOVEREIGN. THOSE WHO PUNISH FAIRLY - OR LEGITIMATELY - ARE SOVEREIGN. AT LEAST THAT IS HOW IT WAS YESTERDAY. BUT IS IT STILL THE CASE TODAY? SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE. NEITHER ARE PUNISHMENTS. WHAT IS THE RESULT? WE DO NOT KNOW. I WILL TRY TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGE OF SOVEREIGNTY IN CRIMINAL LAW THROUGH THE DRAFT REGULATION ON THE COLLECTION OF ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE. I AM GOING TO DISCUSS THREE AXES TO SET THE FRAMEWORK FOR A CRITIQUE. - WHAT WE KNOW - WHAT CHANGES - WHAT WE CAN HOPE FOR OR FEAR.
535	A PREVIOUS ARTICLE IN THIS JOURNAL PRESENTED A CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE POLITICAL LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE AND ITS OPERATIONALISATION FOR 72 COUNTRIES C. 2000. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN UPDATED DATASET OF STATE LEGITIMACY FOR 52 COUNTRIES C. 2008 USING THE SAME CONCEPTUALISATION. IT PRESENTS A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE COMPARATIVE RESULTS OF THE TWO DATASETS.
536	THE AUTHOR ARGUES AGAINST THE ATTEMPT TO FIX ONCE AND FOR ALL THE FEATURES AND PREROGATIVES THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE HUMAN NATURE AS AN ALL-EMBRACING CONCEPT. ON THE BASIS OF A TARGETED APPROACH TO THE CONCEPT OF DISCRIMINATION, SHE EXAMINES A CONCEPT WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE CLEAR: THAT OF HUMAN NATURE. THIS CONCEPT HAS PLAYED, AND STILL PLAYS, A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENABLING LAW TO COUNTERACT DISCRIMINATION. IF WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THIS CONCEPT HAS ON LAW, WE WILL NEED TO CLARIFY ITS MEANING AND NATURE, AND ULTIMATELY ITS RELATION TO LAW. THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT IT IS MISGUIDED TO GROUND LAW IN THIS CONCEPT, ESPECIALLY AS THAT WOULD CARRY THE RISK OF PREVENTING LAW FROM REFLECTING THE NATURAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL DIFFERENCES AMONG INDIVIDUALS.
537	WALDRON SMITHERS WAS HIGHLY CRITICAL OF ATTLEE'S POST-WAR LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND PLACED MUCH WEIGHT ON HAYEK HAVING DEDICATED THE ROAD TO SERFDOM TO 'THE SOCIALISTS OF ALL PARTIES'. ACCORDINGLY, SMITHERS WAS ASSIDUOUS IN COMBATING WHAT HE SAW AS A DANGEROUS TURN TOWARDS MIDDLE-WAY POLICY WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY IN THE LATE 1940S.
538	THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS LEGAL REGULATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBJECTS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. MAIN CONTENT. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS SCIENTIFIC AND REGULATORY APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF "SUBJECT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS", CLASSIFICATION OF SUBJECTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS HAS BEEN RESEARCHED. METHODOLOGY: MATERIALS AND METHODS RESEARCH BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF DOCUMENTARY SOURCES. THE BASIS IS THE DIALECTICAL METHOD OF COGNITION OF THE FACTS OF SOCIAL REALITY, ON WHICH THE FORMAL LEGAL AND COMPARATIVE LEGAL APPROACHES ARE LARGELY BASED. CONCLUSIONS. LEGAL STATUS OF SUBJECTS INVOLVED IN ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DEPENDS DIRECTLY ON ITS LEGISLATIVE DEFINITION, BUT ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVE OR PASSIVE FORMS OF PERFORMING FUNCTIONS OF THE PARTIES AND OTHER PROCEDURAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CALP) OF UKRAINE, DEPENDING ON THEIR INTEREST ARE DIVIDED INTO PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE RESPECTIVE CASE (PARTIES, THIRD PARTIES, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PARTIES AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THIRD PARTIES) AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS (WITNESS, EXPERT, SPECIALIST, ETC.).
539	THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF POPULISM DO NOTHING IF NOT REINFORCE THE NEED TO REDEFINE DEMOCRACY. POPULISM HAS RETURNED TO STAY, SO IT IS NECESSARY TO ANALYZE "POPULIST REASON"; AND FROM THE POST-MARXIST PERSPECTIVE THIS MEANS THE WORK OF MOUFFE AND LACLAU. A REVIEW OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO UNDERSTAND POPULIST MOVEMENTS IS ALSO IMPERATIVE TO CONFRONT THE FICTION OF ONE 'PEOPLE' VERSUS THE REAL AND PLURAL POPULATION. HOWEVER, CONSTITUTIONALISM WILL BE OUR ANSWER TO RESOLVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARADOX: ON THE ONE HAND, POPULAR POWER IS ABSOLUTE; ON THE OTHER HAND, GOVERNMENT BY AND FOR THE CITIZENRY AND, WITH IT, LEGAL LIMIT TO THE EXERCISE OF POWER. NOWADAYS, IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO SEEK A NEW DEFINITION OF POPULISM (SOFT IDEOLOGY, DISCOURSE, POLITICAL STRATEGY, PATHOLOGY), BUT WE NEED TO CONDEMN ITS SYMBIOSIS WITH DEMOCRACY AS VOX POPULI VOX DEI. POPULISM IS NOT THE REDEMPTION OF DEMOCRACY, BUT ITS WORST ENEMY. SO, WE HAVE TWO ALTERNATIVES: EITHER POPULISM IS REDIRECTED THROUGH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ANCHORING IN INDIVIDUAL HUMAN DIGNITY AND INTANGIBLE RIGHTS, OR THE UNLIMITED POWER OF THE PEOPLE AND ITS TOTALITARIAN EMBODIMENT WILL MEAN THAT THE DEMOCRACY'S DAYS ARE NUMBERED.
540	A WIDESPREAD-YET FOR THE MOST PART UNTESTED-PROPOSITION ABOUT NATIONALISM IS THAT IT PROMOTES POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, AND THEREBY UNDERGIRDS PEOPLE'S ALLEGIANCE TO THEIR STATE AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SUPPORT AND COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THIS ARTICLE RECONSIDERS THE GENERAL PROPOSITION THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF SURVEY DATA FROM UKRAINE. USING MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, THE STUDY ISOLATES FOUR DIMENSIONS OF NATIONHOOD AND EXPLORES HOW THEY MIGHT AFFECT THREE DIMENSIONS OF CITIZEN LOYALTY. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT ALL THREE TYPES OF CITIZEN LOYALTY ARE INFLUENCED BY ONE OR MORE DIMENSION OF NATIONHOOD. MOREOVER, ALL FOUR ASPECTS OF NATIONHOOD HAVE AN IMPACT ON CITIZEN LOYALTY, THOUGH ONLY PARTICULAR TYPES OF NATIONHOOD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULAR DIMENSIONS OF SUCH LOYALTY. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS THUS REVEALS STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS TO THE NOTION THAT NATIONALISM PROMOTES POLITICAL OBLIGATION AND POLITICAL OBEDIENCE.
541	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE JURISPRUDENTIAL ARGUMENTS ELABORATED IN DAVID DYZENHAUS'S THE LONG ARC OF LEGALITY. IN PARTICULAR, IT LOOKS INTO THE MAIN CLAIM OF THE BOOK: THAT THE FACT OF "VERY UNJUST LAWS' IS CENTRAL TO ILLUMINATING THE IDEA OF LAW'S AUTHORITY, THE ELABORATION OF WHICH DYZENHAUS TAKES TO BE THE PURPOSE OF LEGAL THEORY. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES DYZENHAUS'S OWN NORMATIVE PROPOSAL IN THIS MATTER, WHICH CONSISTS OF A VERSION OF LEGAL POSITIVISM COMMITTED TO LON FULLER'S PRINCIPLES OF THE INTERNAL MORALITY OF LAW, WITH THE COROLLARY OF A CONCEPTION OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE AS BOUND TO A DUTY TO APPLY THESE INTERNAL PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY WHEN EXERCISING THEIR MAIN FUNCTION. WHILE I CAST SOME DOUBTS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTING THE JUDGE'S FUNCTION THAT WAY, IN THE END I CELEBRATE DYZENHAUS'S ATTEMPT AT REFINING LEGAL POSITIVISM'S IDENTITY, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING DEBATE WITH CONTEMPORARY ANTI-POSITIVISM.
542	THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE POLICY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THERE ARE REASONS TO NOTE THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO ANALYZE THE REGIONAL DETAILS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES TO COUNTER CORRUPTION-RELATED CRIMES THROUGH THE LEGAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL WAYS OF IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTION. IN THE ARTICLE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE CRIMINAL LAW ISSUES RELATED TO THE FIGHT AGAINST SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA. IN THE EARLY 90S OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE COUNTRY REPLACED COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY WITH MARKET IDEOLOGY. TO FULFILL THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY, THE DIALECTICAL METHOD OF COGNITION OF SOCIAL AND LEGAL PHENOMENA AND CONCEPTS IS USED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND INTERDEPENDENCE. HE CONCLUDES THAT HUMAN VALUES AND MORAL PRINCIPLES HAVE CHANGED. THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA FOR DECADES. ENDLESS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CORRUPTION HAVE BECOME A CONVENIENT SCREEN NOT ONLY FOR INCOMPETENT OFFICIALS. POPULAR WITH THE PEOPLE, THE "DISEMBARKATION" OF HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS CREATES A SEMBLANCE OF "MOVEMENT," ALTHOUGH NO REAL ACTION IS TAKEN.
543	THE ARTICLE RECONSTRUCTS SYSTEMATICALLY A DEFINITION ANALYTICALLY DENSE OF THE FACTUAL POWERS. BY FOCUSING ON THE IMPLICATIONS FACTUAL POWERS IN LATIN AMERICA, THE ARTICLE INQUIRIES INTO THE RESISTANCE OF THESE POWERS TO THE STATE OF LAW, EVIDENCING THEIR PROPENSITY TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN PRIVATE INTERESTS AND IMPOSE THEM ON SOCIETY AT LARGE. ON ITS TURN, THE AUTHOR ELABORATES A DIAGNOSIS OF THE CULTURAL EXPANSION OF FACTUAL POWERS IN MEXICAN SOCIETY, DEMONSTRATING THAT THEIR IN FLUENCE EXPRESSES AND REINFORCES POLITICAL DEFICIENCIES, LEGAL VOIDS AND CULTURAL PAUCITY, IDENTIFYING THE IDEOLOGICAL PREPONDERANCE OF PRIVATE TELEVISION.
544	THE PROBLEM OF THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENTLY URGENT. THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY STRENGTHENING SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND BY COMPLICATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. THE QUESTION OF THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT IS EXAMINED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE CONTEXT OF BASES AND MANIFESTATIONS SIGNS OF THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT. IN PARTICULAR THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE STRUCTURE OF RULES OF LAW AS A SIGN OF ITS SYSTEMATIZATION THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF SYMPTOMS OF SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT IN RELATION WITH STRUCTURE AND THE ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW. BASIC APPROACHES OF STRUCTURING THE RULES OF LAW ARE HIGHLIGHTED AND ANALYZED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT. THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT HAS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL EXPRESSION WITH RESPECT TO THE RULE OF LAW. RULE OF LAW IS THE PRIMARY CELL OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT. THE STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE SYSTEM UNITY OF ONE MODEL OF BEHAVIOR, TOWARDS THE PARTICULAR RESULT OF SOCIAL REGULATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE STRUCTURE OF SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW PREDETERMINES AND REFLECTS THE TYPICAL BEHAVIOR OF SUBJECT OF LAW WITH A PARTICULAR SET OF ELEMENTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP REGULATED BY IT. STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT - CONCEPT THAT REFLECTS THE STRUCTURE OF THE RIGHT AS A WHOLE. THE STRUCTURAL CONNECTIONS OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT PIERCE ALL RULES OF LAW. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW SEPARATELY FROM THE STRUCTURES OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT, SINCE THE STRUCTURAL CONNECTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE STANDARD OF RIGHT - BY SYSTEM OF RIGHT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE STRUCTURE OF ITS PRIMARY CELLS IN EXACT FIGURES. THIS ARTICLE REVEALS THE FOLLOWING ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF RIGHT IN THE STRUCTURE OF ITS NORMS: 1) THE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW OBJECTIVELY FUNCTION UNDER THE ACTION OF SYSTEM RELATIONS IN THE RIGHT; 2) THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM INTERACTION OF HYPOTHESIS, DISPOSITION AND SANCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE CONNECTIONS OF THOSE (HYPOTHESIS, DISPOSITION AND SANCTION) ARE CAUSED BY THE MEANINGFUL SIGNS OF A PARTICULAR RULE OF LAW, WHICH REFLECTS THE SPECIFIC RULE OF BEHAVIOR IN THE SPECIFIC SHEAR OF SOCIAL RELATIONS OR IN THE COMPLEX OF THEIR SYSTEM INTERACTION. THE STRUCTURE OF A RULE OF LAW IS LARGELY PREDETERMINED BY THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT MEDIATION OF SOCIAL RELATION SINCE THE CONTENT OF A NORM IS FORMED WITH PARTICIPATION OF STATE IN THE PROCESS OF THE REALIZATION OF LEGAL POLICY. CONSIDERABLE ROLE IN THE DETERMINATION OF SUCH MEANINGFUL COMPONENT IS PLAYED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF RIGHT; 3) RULE OF LAW AS THE MICRO-SYSTEM IN THE SYSTEM OF THE RIGHT FORMATION, INTEGRATED IN THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT BY THE RELATIONS OF STRUCTURE WITH OTHER LEGAL STANDARDS, IT HAS ITS OWN PURPOSEFUL ORIENTATION AND SPECIFIC CHARACTER; 4) SPECIFICALLY, THE RULE OF LAW CAN ACT RELATIVELY INDEPENDENTLY, STABLY AND BE AUTONOMOUS, THAT NONE OF ITS ELEMENTS CAN ACHIEVE. THIS MAKES APPARENT THE PROPERTY "OF THE EMERGENCE" OF THE RULE OF LAW. 5) IN THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS "FACTUALITY" OF THE SYSTEM OF RIGHT IS REVEALED, I.E. EXPRESSION IN THE ELEMENTARY UNITS OF THE SYSTEM OF PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE INHERENT TO THE SYSTEM AS WHOLE AND WHICH COMPOSE ITS QUALITATIVE SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
545	THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN JOHN BORNEMAN AND RICHARD ASHBY WILSON EXAMINES SEVERAL OF THE KEY QUESTIONS FOR LAW AND POLITICS THAT HAVE COME TO THE FORE SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR. BEGINNING WITH BORNEMAN'S CONTRIBUTIONS OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES, IN WHICH HE ELABORATES THE CONCEPTS OF ACCOUNTABILITY, CARE, AND AFFECT, BOTH AUTHORS THEN ENGAGE WITH HOW THESE ISSUES EMERGE IN THEIR OWN RESEARCH IN DIFFERENT LOCALES. THEY ARGUE FOR THE GLOBAL RELEVANCE OF THESE CONCEPTS FOR THE RECENT AUTHORITARIAN TURN AND INCREASINGLY VOCAL DEMANDS FOR JUSTICE. DRAWING ON THE HISTORY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL STUDY OF KINSHIP AND LAW, THEY ASK HOW PSYCHOANALYTIC UNDERSTANDINGS OF VIOLENCE AND THE DOMESTIC SPHERE MIGHT POSE NEW QUESTIONS IN CONTEMPORARY DEBATES. THEY ASSESS, IN TURN, THE PLACE OF RETRIBUTION IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE STRATEGIES SUCH AS CRIMINAL TRIALS AND TRUTH COMMISSIONS, THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CARE IN QUERYING RELATIONALITY AFTER POLITICAL VIOLENCE, THE RELATION OF AFFECT AND REVENGE TO JUSTICE, THE CHANGING GENDER OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RECIPROCITY IN BOTH VIOLENCE AND CARE, THE ROLE OF AGGRESSION AND THE DEATH DRIVE IN PRODUCING AND REDRESSING VIOLENCE, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LAW TO TRAUMA WORK.
546	LAW AND ORDER DENOTES A NEGATIVE FORM OF PEACE SECURED AMONG THE MEMBERS OF A GIVEN SOCIAL OR POLITICAL ORDER. MINIMALLY, IT IS AN APPEAL TO RESTORE PUBLIC ORDER TO CONDITIONS CLASSED AS DISORDERLY, OR TO DEFEND IT AGAINST POTENTIAL OR ARTICULATED THREATS. BUT WHAT COUNTS AS PUBLIC DISORDER, AND WHY IS IT A PROBLEM FOR ANY GIVEN SOCIAL OR POLITICAL ORDER? ALTHOUGH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENTISTS TEND TO CONCUR THAT IT IS DETERMINED BY TRADITION AND CONVENTION, FOR SOME, THE FACT OF DISORDER IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO BACK PROJECTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ORDER MAINTENANCE. OTHERS EMPHASIZE THAT FACTS ABOUT DISORDER ARE THEMSELVES SOCIALLY MADE. LAW AND ORDER IS NOT A NEUTRAL CATEGORY FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISORDER, LET ALONE FOR INTERVENTION. IT IS AN IDEOLOGICAL OR DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCT THAT ITSELF WARRANTS SCRUTINY. FOR STILL OTHERS, IT IS NOT JUST AN ELEMENT OF IDEOLOGY BUT A COMPONENT IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF NEOLIBERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH NEEDS TO BE STUDIED IN TERMS OF ITS FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURAL EFFECTS. AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO QUERY WHETHER LAW OUGHT TO BE CONJOINED WITH ORDER AT ALL. THEY ARGUE THAT NO STABLE OR NECESSARY RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT THE VERY IDEA OF LAW AND ORDER IS INCONGRUOUS; THAT LAW AND DISORDER OR LAW OR ORDER IS APPOSITE.
547	TRADITIONAL POLICY REFORMS OF THE TYPE EMBODIED IN THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS HAVE BEEN OUT OF ACADEMIC FASHION FOR DECADES. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF A PAPER THAT CONVINCINGLY REJECTS THE EFFICACY OF THESE REFORMS. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEFINE GENERALIZED REFORM AS A DISCRETE, SUSTAINED JUMP IN AN INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, WHOSE COMPONENTS MAP WELL ONTO THE POINTS OF THE OLD CONSENSUS. WE IDENTIFY 49 CASES OF GENERALIZED REFORM IN OUR DATASET THAT SPANS 141 COUNTRIES FROM 1970 TO 2015. THE AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE REFORMS IS POSITIVE, SIZEABLE, AND SIGNIFICANT OVER 5- AND 10- YEAR WINDOWS. THE RESULT IS ROBUST TO DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS FOR DEFINING REFORM AND DIFFERENT ESTIMATION METHODS. WE ARGUE THAT THE POLICY REFORM BABY WAS PREMATURELY THROWN OUT WITH THE NEOLIBERAL BATHWATER.
548	THE RELEVANCE OF THE ARTICLE IS STIPULATED BY THE NECESSITY TO STUDY A SPECIFIC TYPE OF LEGAL EDUCATION - LEGAL CLINICAL EDUCATION. HOWEVER, LEGAL CLINICS ARE THE BASIS FOR THE PRACTICAL TRAINING AND STUDENTS' PRACTICE IMPLEMENTATION I.E. THEY ALLOW TO TRANSFER THE OBTAINED THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE INTO THE PRACTICAL ONES. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE PECULIARITIES OF FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED EDUCATION IN UKRAINE IN GENERAL, AND IN IMITATION OF THE LEGAL CLINIC "ISTYNA" OF DNIPROPETROVSK STATE UNIVERSITY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS ACTIVITIES, IN PARTICULAR, AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE PROSPECTS OF THE LEGAL CLINICAL MOVEMENT. THE BASIC METHODS IN THE STUDY OF THIS ISSUES ARE THE FOLLOWING: THE HISTORICAL METHOD; THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS. THE METHOD OF PREDICTION TO DETERMINE THE PROSPECTS FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL CLINICAL EDUCATION IN UKRAINE IN THE CONTEXT OF INTEGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN EDUCATIONAL AREA AND THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT WAS ALSO APPLIED. THE ARTICLE ELUCIDATES THE CONCEPT "LEGAL CLINICAL EDUCATION", FOCUSES ON THE NECESSITY FOR THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION, AND DETERMINES THE PROSPECTS OF ACHIEVING QUALITY RESULTS OF LEGAL CLINICAL EDUCATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS COMPONENTS IN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL EDUCATION BY THE IMITATION OF THE LEGAL CLINIC "ISTYNA" OF DNIPROPETROVSK STATE UNIVERSITY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THE MATERIALS OF THE ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL IN FUTURE STUDIES OF THE LEGAL CLINICS ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEPT LEGAL OF EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT IN UKRAINE.
549	PURPOSE: TO PERFORM A RATHER CRUDE, SKEPTIC ANALYSIS OF THE FUTURE SIGNING OF THE PEACE AGREEMENT IN LA HABANA, CUBA WITH THE INSURGENT GROUP FUERZAS ARMADAS REVOLUCIONARIAS DE COLOMBIA-EJERCITO DEL PUEBLO (FARC-EP) SO THAT INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. DESCRIPTION: THIS ARTICLE STARTS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT POST-CONFLICT IS THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO MACROECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT THE STATE MUST FACE. THEN, INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES IN WHICH A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN LIVED ARE CONSIDERED AND SOME CONDITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED IN ORDER NOT TO REPEAT THE RESULTS. IT CONTINUES WITH THE ANALYSIS OF COLOMBIAN INSTITUTIONS ENGAGED IN WAR AND THEIR EVOLUTION PATHS ARE SUCCINCTLY PROPOSED. POINT OF VIEW: THE FOREGOING PROVES THAT COLOMBIA DESERVES THE PEACE AWAITED FOR SO LONG BY THE ENTIRE SOCIETY BUT WITH SUSTAINABLE RESULTS, DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OBTAINED IN CENTRAL AMERICA. THE CENTRAL THESIS OR POINT OF VIEW DEFENDED IS THAT PEACE IS MORE THAN A SIGNATURE. IT MUST BE AN INTEGRATED SET OF LONG-TERM ACTIONS INSTEAD OF STRATEGIES STRUCTURED IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT. CONCLUSIONS: COLOMBIA IS NOT PREPARED FOR PEACE UNDERSTOOD AS SOCIAL JUSTICE.
550	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN CASES OF SUSPENSION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH JURISPRUDENCE IN UKRAINE, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA). HE MADE THE COMPARATIVE METHOD. ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATION, THE NUMBER OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN UKRAINE BY THE AUTHORITY AND MISCONDUCT OF MEDICAL DOCTORS IS ABOUT 2% PER POPULATION, MY FIGURE THAT RISES TO 30% IN EUROPE AND IS THE STABLE YES IN THE US AND IS 28%. 32%. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE ARTICLE IS OFTEN AREA IDENTIFY SPECIALIZATIONS IN THE MEDICAL OFFICE OCCURS WITH THE MAYOR BASED ON UKRAINIAN JURISPRUDENCE (DATA FROM UKRAINE'S ONLY STATE JUDICIAL DECISION REGISTER FROM 2016 TO 2019). IN ADDITION, THE STUDY ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF THE MAIN INFLUENCES ON THE ABILITY OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONS. FROM COUNTING THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SURGEONS, GYNECOLOGISTS, PARAMEDICS, AND ANESTHESIOLOGISTS ARE THE MOST PRONE TO DEVIATION AND MEDICAL ERROR. KEY PROPOSED CRITERIA HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS MEDICAL ERRORS DIFFER FROM MEDICAL WRITING.
551	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE NATURE OF PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY IN COLOMBIA, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF INTELLIGENCE. IT ASKS WHAT PROBLEMS EXIST AS A BY-PRODUCT OF PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES, AND ADDITIONALLY EXPLORES WHETHER THERE EXISTS A FRAMEWORK OF SOCIETAL NORMS THAT A STATE AGENCY MIGHT CO-OPT TO OVERSEE AND REGULATE THOSE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE RECEIVED GOVERNMENT TRAINING IN INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH. THIS STUDY OFFERS THREE CASE STUDIES OF PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY, EVALUATES THE RESULTING RISK OR THREAT TO CITIZEN SECURITY AND PRIVACY, AND PRESENTS A NOVEL, NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO CONTROL PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. THE PRESENT AUTHOR'S APPLICATION OF SPEARIN'S ANALYSIS OF FOUR FORMS OF PRIVATE SECTOR RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD THE PUBLIC; NAMELY, POLITICAL, JUDICIAL, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY, RESULTS IN THE FINDING THAT THE ETHOS OF GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE UNDERLIES A FEASIBLE APPROACH TO THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S MANAGEMENT OF PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE.
552	(1)AFGHANISTAN'S JUSTICE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY AT A CRUCIAL AND TROUBLED STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL DETERMINE ITS EFFECTIVENESS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE PHENOMENON OF CORRUPTION INSIDE JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. BY INTEGRATING THE ANALYSIS OF NARRATIVES OF CORRUPTION WITH THE OBSERVATION OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE AND A CRITICAL APPROACH TO THE RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS, I ARGUE THAT IN AFGHANISTAN, THE PHENOMENON OF CORRUPTION CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF ITS DOUBLE INSTITUTIONALISATION, WHEREBY MECHANISMS OF EXCHANGE AND OF COMPENSATION, BOTH ALREADY AFFIRMED AT THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL PRACTICE, FIND A POSSIBILITY OF REAFFIRMATION (OF RE-INSTITUTIONALISATION) IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM ITSELF. THE CREATION OF AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT DEPENDS ON INTERNATIONAL AID, THE CONSOLIDATION OF A STATE APPARATUS OVER-DETERMINED BY WARLORDISM AND FOREIGN INFLUENCES, AND THE PROCESS OF LEGAL MODERNISATION ITSELF ALL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE RE-INSTITUTIONALISATION AND RADICALISATION OF CORRUPTION. BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THIS SCENARIO, I ADOPT AN ETHNOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION ON THE WORK OF JUDGES AND ON THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ITSELF.
553	THE END TO THE WAR IN LIBERIA, ALONG WITH QUALITY LEADERSHIP AND A LARGE UN PRESENCE HAS LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR A SUCCESSFUL PEACE PROCESS. NOW THE DELICATE PART OF THE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY-BUILDING VIABLE, EQUITABLE, AND DURABLE SOCIAL RELATIONS, INSTITUTIONS AND LEGAL CONSTRUCTS. A POTENTIALLY VOLATILE PART OF ANY POSTWAR SCENARIO IS THE INABILITY OF LAND RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS TO PERFORM IN AN EFFECTIVE, LEGITIMATE, EQUITABLE MANNER. REFORM OF LAND TENURE VIA POLICIES, LAWS, INSTITUTIONS, AND CAPACITY, NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A MANNER THAT IS ABLE TO ATTEND TO BOTH THE LAND RIGHTS RELATED CAUSES OF CONFLICT, AND THE TANGLE OF LAND PROBLEMS BROUGHT ON BY THE WAR ITSELF. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN LIBERIA, AND EXAMINES THE PRIMARY SET OF LAND TENURE PROBLEMS IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS FOR DEALING WITH THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF POSTWAR LAND TENURE, AND THE LIBERIAN CASE. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
554	IN MY REPLY TO JEREMY WALDRON'S ARTICLE 'ARE SOVEREIGNS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW?', I DRAW UPON AND IN SOME WAYS EXPAND WALDRON'S IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. FIRST OF ALL, I SUGGEST THAT WALDRON'S ARGUMENT ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW CAN BE USED TO ILLUMINATE HOW WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW OVER SOVEREIGN STATES, BUT ALSO HOW SOME OF SOVEREIGN STATES' RESIDUAL INDEPENDENCE OUGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM LEGITIMATE INTERNATIONAL LAW. SECONDLY, I ARGUE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PEDIGREE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW PLAYS A ROLE WHEN ASSESSING HOW INTERNATIONAL LAW BINDS DEMOCRATIC SOVEREIGN STATES AND WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW CAN AND OUGHT TO BENEFIT THEIR INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS. FINALLY, I EMPHASIZE HOW WALDRON'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW OUGHT TO BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS IN PRIORITY HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND FOR WHAT SOURCES CAN BE REGARDED AS SOURCES OF VALID LAW.
555	THE LINK BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE COURTS HAS BECOME MORE PROMINENT IN RECENT TIMES, WITH COURTS AND JUDGES BEING DESCRIBED AS THEULTIMATE VANGUARDOF BROAD ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS, AND THE RIGHTS BEING DESCRIBED ASGAME-CHANGING LEGAL TOOLS OVER WHICH JUDGES HAVE SUBSTANTIAL POWER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE INFANCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE SLOW RATE AT WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING GENERALLY (AND IN AFRICA IN PARTICULAR), SCHOLARS HAVE OBSERVED THAT THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE GAP WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SPECIFIC TASKS AND ROLES THAT COURTS HAVE TO PERFORM WHEN IT COMES TO ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS, AND THEIR OVERALL NET CONTRIBUTION TO ADVANCING THE TYPE OF INTERESTS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS SEEK TO PROMOTE. BECAUSE COURTS OFTEN HAVE TO BALANCE THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND DEVELOPMENT (WHICH IS ACUTELY NEEDED IN MOST AFRICAN STATES), THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE COURTS HAVE BEEN PLAYING IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT SOLELY BASED ON A NUMBER OF AFRICAN CASE LAW.
556	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EU'S IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS AND TURKEY. IT ENQUIRES INTO THE REASONS BEHIND THE PATCHY RECORD OF RULE-OF-LAW REFORMS IN TURKEY, CROATIA AND ALBANIA BY EXAMINING JUDICIAL REFORMS IN RESPONSE TO THE EU ACCESSION REQUIREMENTS. IT ARGUES THAT A CREDIBLE EU ACCESSION PERSPECTIVE AND AN ADEQUATE DEGREE OF STATE CAPACITY ARE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR EXPLAINING THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RULE-OF-LAW STANDARDS IN EU ACCESSION COUNTRIES. THE GENUINE, PARTIAL OR NON-ALIGNMENT OF THE RULING ELITES' DOMESTIC INCENTIVES WITH THE EU INCENTIVES IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF RULE-OF-LAW TRENDS IN THE WESTERN BALKANS AND TURKEY.
557	AFTER FORMING PART OF THE CAROLINGIAN EMPIRE, THE COUNTIES OF THE HISPANIC MARCH BEGAN A PROCESS OF SOCIAL FEUDALISATION THAT WILL LEAD TO DE FACTO INDEPENDENCE FROM THE EMPIRE AND THE FORMATION OF A FEUDAL POLYARCHY PROGRESSIVELY DIRECTED BY THE COUNT OF BARCELONA. THE TRANSFORMATION OF FEUDAL USES AND USAGES INTO CUSTOMARY LAW WILL GIVE WAY TO THE FEUDAL MONARCHY OF THE COUNTS OF BARCELONA WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ITS CURIA, WILL DRIVE THE WRITING OF THE USATGES OF BARCELONA, A FEUDAL CODE OF TRANSITION THAT REGULATES THE PROBLEMS GENERATED BY A SOCIETY THAT REVOLVES AROUND FIEFS, CASTLES AND AN ORDER OF LEGITIMACY BASED ON PERSONAL FIDELITY, BUT WHICH, AT THE SAME TIME, INTEGRATE THE TRADITION OF THE LIBER IUDICIORUM OF THE VISIGODS AND ARE CONCERNED WITH SHAPING THE LEGAL FIGURES OF THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCIPALITY OF CATALONIA. THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PRINCIPALITY OF CATALONIA IN THE LEGAL CULTURE OF THE EUROPEAN IUS COMMUNE WILL PROMOTE THE REBIRTH OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY (IURISDICTIO) AND THE LAW OR CONSTITUTION AS A SOURCE OF LAW. THE STRUGGLE FOR THE DIRECTION OF SOCIETY BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND THE PRINCIPALITY WILL PROPITIATE THE GRADUAL TRANSITION FROM THE MONISTIC FEUDAL MONARCHY (WHERE ONLY THE PRINCE CAN MAKE THE CONSTITUTIONS) TO A DUALISTIC STATE MONARCHY (WHERE THE CONSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE AGREED IN THE PARLAMENT BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND THE THREE ESTATES OF THE GENERAL OF CATALONIA). THE STUDY OF THE JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL LITIGATION BETWEEN THE KING AND THE VISCOUNT OF CARDONA AND THE REFORMIST PROJECTS OF THE UNIVERSAL JUSTICE OF THE CROWN OF ARAGON PROMOTED BY THE CORTS ALLOWS US TO CALIBRATE THE VALUE THAT WAS GRANTED TO THE CONTROL UNILATERAL OF THE KING OR AGREED WITH THE ESTATES- OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND THE CORRELATIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
558	INDIA'S POLICY OF PUBLIC CONSULTATION IN THE LEGISLATION PROCESS IS CURRENTLY NOT MANDATORY. THE CONCEPT OF PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY AND INCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC HAS PROVEN TO BE AN INVALUABLE ADDITION TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, AND THE ABSENCE OF THE SAME HAS LED TO INSTANCES OF WIDESPREAD PROTEST AND DISCONTENTMENT. THE POLICY OF PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY WAS INTRODUCED IN 2014. HOWEVER, CERTAIN BILLS PASSED POST-2014 HAVE WITNESSED PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER ITS LACK OF CONSULTATION AND MAJORITY STAKEHOLDERS' ADVERSE EFFECTS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY AND PROVIDE FOR A MANDATORY METHOD TO BE FOLLOWED WHILE IMPLEMENTING A MANDATORY PROCESS OF PRE-LEGISLATIVE SCRUTINY. A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL STRUCTURE IS ONE THAT IS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW, THERE WILL BE NO POLITICAL FUTURE. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, WITH THE RULE OF LAW AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, INEQUALITY, AN OPEN PARLIAMENT, AND AN AUTONOMOUS JUDICIARY AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. THE REQUISITE DATA WAS GATHERED FROM WRITTEN AND ONLINE MEDIA IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RULE OF LAW. ONLY THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE STATE INSTITUTIONS WILL ENABLE A FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC TO THRIVE.
559	MUCH OF THE EXISTING HISTORICAL WORK ON POLITICS IN INDEPENDENT ZAMBIA STRESSES THE COUNTRY'S COMPARATIVE LACK OF RACIAL TENSION. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, AS ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA, RACIAL IDEAS WERE DEPLOYED IN THE EARLY YEARS AFTER THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE IN 1964 AND FOUND EXPRESSION IN THE COMPETING FORMS OF NATIONALISM THAT MANIFESTED THEMSELVES WITHIN THE GOVERNING UNITED NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE PARTY. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE CASE OF JAMES SKINNER, A WHITE ZAMBIAN OF IRISH DESCENT AND HEAD OF THE COUNTRY'S JUDICIARY, WHO IN JULY 1969 WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER HE SUPPORTED THE DECISION OF A WHITE HIGH COURT JUDGE TO ACQUIT TWO WHITE PORTUGUESE SOLDIERS WHO HAD ILLEGALLY CROSSED INTO ZAMBIA FROM ANGOLA. DRAWING ON ARCHIVAL, NEWSPAPER AND ORAL SOURCES, I ARGUE THAT THE SKINNER CASE WAS A TOUCHSTONE FOR DIVERGENT INTRA-PARTY VISIONS OF ZAMBIA AS AN INDEPENDENT NATION: VISIONS THAT PLAYED OUT THROUGH RACIAL AND REGIONAL SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS. SLOGANS DEPLOYED DURING THE CAMPAIGN TO OUST SKINNER, MOST NOTABLY 'A WHITE MAN WILL NEVER BE A ZAMBIAN', SHED LIGHT ON HOW THE CONSTRUCTION OF ZAMBIAN POLITICAL ATTITUDES, NATIONAL IDENTITY AND CITIZENSHIP BECAME CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH RACIAL IDENTITIES. ZAMBIA WAS NOT THE EXCEPTION WITHIN SOUTHERN AFRICA THAT IT HAS COMMONLY BEEN ASSUMED TO BE.
560	WITH ITS STRONG IDEOLOGISATION, HUNGARY'S NEW CONSTITUTION PRESENTS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE AMONG EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, CRITICISM THAT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IS ABANDONING THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT TRUE. THE CONSTITUTION DOES HAVE SOME FLAWS WITH REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW, BUT OVERALL IT REMAINS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. NONETHELESS, IT PROVIDES SOME STARTING POINTS FOR A ILLIBERAL MAJORITY TO CURTAIL THE RULE OF LAW.
561	THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM IS HEAVILY BASED ON THE SIGNATURE OF CONVENTIONS AND THE RECOGNITION OF INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL BODIES BY THE STATES. BUT NOTABLE DIFFERENCES EXIST, WHICH BEG QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE APPLICATION OF THE DECISIONS OF THE REGIONAL BODIES AND THE POSSIBLE IMPACT ON THE DOMESTIC LAW OF A STATE WHERE THE NATIONAL LEGAL NORMS ARE NOT ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH THOSE OF THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. BRAZIL AND THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM (IHRS) HAVE A RELATION WHICH ILLUSTRATES IN DETAIL THIS REALITY. TO UNDERSTAND THE PARTICIPATION OF THE BRAZILIAN STATE, IT IS VITAL TO GRASP THE IMPACT OF LATIN AMERICA ON THE ELABORATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR THE AMERICAN DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MAN AND THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS WITH THIS CONTEXTUALIZATION THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND IN LARGE PART THE VARIABILITY OF THE INTENSITY OF THE BRAZILIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPETENCE OF THE IHRS. FOR HISTORICAL REASONS, THE MEETING OF THE PAST AND THE PRESENT IN REGARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN BRAZIL IS TUMULTUOUS. WHILE THE IHRS USED TO HAVE IN THE PAST AN APPROACH AIMING AT THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, IT EVOLVED TOWARDS AN EMPHASIS ON EGALITARIAN POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND LEGAL APPROACHES. THE IHRS' JURISPRUDENCE IS THEREFORE A LEGAL BINDING FOR THE PROMOTION OF NATIONAL JUSTICE AT THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND LEGAL LEVELS. THE AFTERMATH OF DICTATORSHIPS CONSEQUENTLY STILL HAS INFLUENCE ON THE BRAZILIAN RULE OF LAW.
562	THE PERSISTENCE OF CORRUPTION AMID INTENSIFIED ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVES SUGGESTS THAT ENTITLEMENT NOTIONS UNDERPINNING INVOLVEMENT IN CORRUPT PRACTICES DESERVE GREATER ATTENTION. RECENT EVIDENCE FROM AFRICA'S ENERGY SECTOR EMPHASISES THE FUNCTIONALITY OF CORRUPTION AS AN UNSANCTIONED REMEDIATION RESPONSE TO (PERCEIVED) ENTRENCHED ENERGY INJUSTICES. THESE INSIGHTS ARE ABSENT FROM RECENT CORRUPTION AND ENERGY JUSTICE SCHOLARSHIP. IN KENYA, UNEVEN SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICAL GRIDS, RED TAPE IN GRID CONNECTIONS, 'UNJUST' ELECTRICITY BILLING SYSTEMS, AND LOWER ENERGY OUTPUT OF DECENTRALISED SOLAR PV SYSTEMS COMPELLED CERTAIN ENERGY USERS TO EMPLOY SURREPTITIOUS STRATEGIES TO GAIN OR EXPEDITE ELECTRICAL GRID ACCESS. LACKADAISICAL ENFORCEMENT OF NET METERING TARIFF REGULATIONS IN GHANA HAS DENIED CUSTOMERS ENTITLEMENTS TO ELECTRICITY CREDITS TO MITIGATE AGAINST 'UNJUST' TARIFFS. MEANWHILE, GHANA'S MAIN ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTOR (ECG) CONTINUES TO BILL NET-METERED CUSTOMERS TO COMPENSATE FOR (POTENTIAL) UNBRIDLED TARIFF DEFAULTING. SOME DISGRUNTLED CUSTOMERS DELIBERATELY DEFAULTED ON TARIFF PAYMENTS TO 'COMPENSATE' THEMSELVES UNTIL ECG THREATENED TO DISCONNECT THEM FROM THE GRID. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS SURVEY EVIDENCE FROM GHANA AND KENYA SHOWING WHY ENERGY USERS AND ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS JUSTIFY ADHERENCE TO 'TIT-FOR-TAT' NORMS AND OTHER 'BINDING PRECEDENTS' WHICH CONTRAVENE THE LAW. WE ARGUE THAT ENERGY INJUSTICE AND CORRUPTION ARE INTRINSIC TO THE 'ELECTRIFICATION REGIMES' OF BOTH COUNTRIES, WITH BLATANT VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW BOTH CONSTRAINING AND ENABLING ENERGY ACCESS. THE PREDOMINANTLY WESTERN-FRAMED ENERGY JUSTICE SCHOLARSHIP MAY BENEFIT FROM A MORE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LEGALITY AND NECESSITY IN NON-WESTERN ENERGY SECTORS.
563	IN THIS CONTRIBUTION I ADDRESS THE TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAT THREATENS A STATE'S MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE, MEANING THAT THE STATE'S COMPETENCE TO PROVIDE CITIZENS WITH ELEMENTARY SECURITY IS CHALLENGED. THE QUESTION IS, WHETHER ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE STATE TO WARD OFF THESE THREATS (SHOULD) FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. A CENTRAL PROBLEM IS THE INDETERMINACY THAT IS INHERENT IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY, IMPLICATING THAT ADEQUATE MEASURES AS WELL AS CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS TO BE IMPOSED ON SUCH MEASURES CANNOT EASILY BE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE. THIS INDETERMINACY RAISES TWO INTERRELATED ISSUES. FIRSTLY, THE ISSUE OF WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO SPEAK OF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION WHEN THE EXISTING JURISDICTION IS CHALLENGED AS SUCH. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE INDETERMINACY CALL FOR INHERENTLY UNLIMITED POWERS OF THE STATE, IMPLYING THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS CRIMINAL JURISDICTION DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY? SECOND-IF CRIMINAL JURISDICTION IS NOT IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE STATE OF EMERGENCY-THE ISSUE OF WHAT CRIMINAL LIABILITY COULD MEAN IN SUCH A STATE NEEDS TO BE CONFRONTED. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE INDETERMINACY INHERENT IN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY JEOPARDISE CRIMINAL LIABILITY BECAUSE SUCH INDETERMINACY ENGENDERS SEVERE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE STANDARDS AGAINST WHICH THE RELEVANT ACTIONS ARE TO BE JUDGED? BOTH ISSUES WILL BE DISCUSSED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, ASSUMING THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY IS BOTH THE COMPETENCE TO SUSTAIN THE MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE AND THE POSSIBILITY TO CONSTRAIN THE POWERS OF THE STATE.
564	THE LIMITATION OF NULLITY APPEALS TO CASES OF 'SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE CORRECTNESS OF THE FACTS' ON WHICH THE LOWER COURT BASED UPON ITS DECISION IS IN CONFORMITY MATH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. IT DOES NOT VIOLATE THE PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS PROTECTED BY ARTICLE 6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS OR THE RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW PROTECTED BY ARTICLE 7 OF THE AUSTRIAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. DESPITE THE RESTRICTIVE APPLICATION IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF AUSTRIA, THE LIMITATION IS PROPORTIONATE UND THUS CONSTITUTIONAL, AS SUCH LIMITATIONS ONLY APPLY TO RULINGS BY A PENAL OF LAY JUDGES.
565	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THREE DISTINCT PATTERNS OF INVESTMENT BEHAVIOR BY VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY SECTOR START-UPS IN CHINA. THE FIRST PATTERN IS THE SERVICE-ORIENTED, TECHNOLOGY-LIGHT INVESTMENT BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY THE FOREIGN VENTURE CAPITALIST FIRMS NOT FOUNDED BY ETHNIC CHINESE. THE SECOND PATTERN IS THE TECHNOLOGY CREATION INVESTMENT PATTERN EXHIBITED BY FOREIGN FIRMS FOUNDED BY ETHNIC CHINESE AND EMBEDDED IN ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITIES. THE THIRD PATTERN CONSISTS OF LOCAL STATE-FUNDED CHINESE VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS THAT CHOOSE EITHER TO INVEST IN STATE-DIRECTED PROJECTS OR OPT OUT OF INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY START-UPS ENTIRELY. WHAT EXPLAINS THE DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR BETWEEN THE STRICTLY FOREIGN AND THE ETHNIC CHINESE-EMBEDDED FOREIGN FIRMS ARE THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THESE FIRMS HONED THEIR SKILLS. THE DIFFERENT LEARNED EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM OPERATING IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS EXPLAINS WHY THE FOREIGN FIRMS AVOID INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY-GENERATING ACTIVITIES IN CHINA WHEREAS THE ETHNIC CHINESE FIRMS ARE WILLING TO DO SO DESPITE CHINA'S NOTORIOUS WEAK INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS REGIME. THE POLITICAL FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINANCE IN CHINA EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOR AND ESSENTIAL FAILURE OF THE LOCAL STATE-RUN VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS. THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT SEVERAL DISTINCT, SEPARATE AND NON-CLASHING INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONCURRENTLY OPERATING WITHIN CHINA AND SHAPING THE BEHAVIOR OF VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS THERE.
566	ACHIEVING A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION, WHICH PROMOTES EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE, AND OVERSIGHT OF THAT DISCRETION TO ENSURE POLITICAL RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN A CLASSIC AND ENDURING ISSUE IN PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION LITERATURE. THIS STUDY JOINS THE DIALOGUE BY EXAMINING THE QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA, WHERE POWER IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AND THERE ARE NOT MANY CHECKS AND BALANCES. BY EXAMINING ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION IN WORK SAFETY REGULATION, THIS STUDY ARGUES THAT IN CHINA'S CONTEXT, THE TENSION BETWEEN EFFICIENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS IS LESS EXPLICIT AMONG THE LEGISLATURE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY POWERS, BUT MORE EXPLICIT BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL POWERS. IN OTHER WORDS, IF LOCAL BUREAUCRACIES HAVE CONSIDERABLE DISCRETIONARY POWER, THEY MAY USE THIS POWER TO ACHIEVE LOCAL INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF NATIONAL GOALS. TO IMPROVE LOCAL BUREAUCRACIES' POLITICAL RESPONSIVENESS, THE CHINESE LEADERS HAVE ADOPTED BOTH LEGAL AND MANAGERIAL MEASURES. ON THE ONE HAND, ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CURBED THROUGH ELABORATE LEGISLATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, MANAGEMENT REFORMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BRINGING LOCAL LEADERS' GOALS IN LINE WITH NATIONAL ONES. CHINA'S EFFORTS TO BALANCE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY AND POLITICAL RESPONSIVENESS SUGGEST THAT EACH COUNTRY MUST CHOOSE SOLUTIONS IN KEEPING WITH ITS OWN CONTEXT AND PROBLEMS.
567	LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IS AN INSEPARABLE PART OF THE BROADER RIGHT OF DEFENCE. ANY PERSON UNDER PROSECUTION IS ENTITLED TO AN ARRAY OF MINIMUM GUARANTEES, AMONG WHICH IS THE HAVE ADEQUATE TIME AND MEANS AVAILABLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIS DEFENCE AND TO COMMUNICATE CONFIDENTIALLY WITH COUNSEL OF THEIR CHOICE. IN THE CASE OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH COUNSEL, TOGETHER WITH FORMAL SECRECY OF COMMUNICATIONS, RECOGNIZED IN THE ART. 18.3 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION, CONCURS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SECRECY, ALSO SUBSTANTIAL IN NATURE, WHICH IS PROFESSIONAL SECRECY, ARISING FROM THE ESPECIAL NATURE OF WHAT IS BEING COMMUNICATED AND GIVEN THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTNERS. THEREFORE, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERCEPTION OF THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED ONLY FROM THE UNIQUE VIEWPOINT OF ART. 18.3 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION, BUT ALSO IN LIGHT OF THE RIGHT TO A DEFENCE PROCLAIMED IN ITS ART. 24. WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE RIGHTS NOT TO SUFFER LACK OF DEFENCE AND TO HAVE LEGAL COUNSEL CAN BE SUBJECTED TO THE NEED TO PRESERVE OTHER RIGHTS OR CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED VALUES, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESTRICTIVE MEASURE TO THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IS BASED ON PROPORTIONALITY. THEREFORE, IT SHOULD BE ASSESSED WHETHER THAT RESTRICTIVE MEASURE IS BALANCED OR PROPORTIONATE, AS THE RESULT OF THERE BEING MORE ADVANTAGES OR BENEFITS TO THE GENERAL INTEREST THAN DAMAGES TO OTHER CONFLICTING RIGHTS OR VALUES. OUR LEGISLATOR HAS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR THE INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE LAWYER SOLELY IN THE CASE OF TERRORISM CRIMES. HOWEVER, IF IT IS ACCEPTED THAT TERRORISM IS NOT THE ONLY CRIME FOR WHICH SOCIETY MUST DEFEND ITSELF WITH EXTRAORDINARY MEANS IS THE LEGISLATOR WHO MUST BALANCE THE NEED TO INCLUDE OTHER CASES. THE ACTION OF THE COURT CAN ONLY REFER TO A PARTICULAR CASE, WHICH IMPLIES THE NEED, AT THE OUTSET, FOR THE LEGISLATOR TO ESTABLISH, IN AN ABSTRACT WAY, THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MEASURE, ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW THAT INSPIRES COURT ACTION. THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY SHOULD INSPIRE BOTH THE DECISIONS FOR THE LEGISLATOR WHEN FORESEEN SUCH POSSIBILITY AND THE ACTIONS OF THE COURT IN SUCH A CASE. AN OBJECT OF SPECIAL INTEREST HAS BEEN THE INTERPRETATION OF ART. 51 OF THE ORGANIC LAW 1 / 1979 OF IMPRISONMENT, THAT GOVERNS COMMU-NICATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE OF THOSE WHO ARE DETAINED IN PRISONS. SPECIAL REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME OF MONEY LAUNDERING, SINCE OUR APPLICABLE LAW ESTABLISHES CERTAIN SPECIALTIES THAT CAN AFFECT THE RIGHT OF DEFENCE.
568	IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT PROCEDURAL FORMALISM UNDERMINES ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY BY FOSTERING RENT-SEEKING AND CORRUPTION. WE CHALLENGE THIS VIEW BY ARGUING THAT A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURES FOSTER ECONOMIC GROWTH BY INCREASING THE PREDICTABILITY OF COURT DECISIONS, WHICH LEADS TO MORE TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHER INVESTMENT LEVELS. WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH OF 15 JUDICIAL PROCEDURES. EMPLOYING A STANDARD GROWTH MODEL, WE FIND IN A CROSS-SECTION OF 67 COUNTRIES THAT TIMELINESS, WRITTEN-AS OPPOSED TO ORAL-PROCEDURES, AND THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON GROWTH, WHEREAS THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT PROCEDURAL ACTIONS AS WELL AS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS. OUR RESULTS PARTIALLY CONTRADICT THE RESULTS OF FORMER STUDIES BASED ON THE LEX MUNDI DATASET.
569	THEME AND SCOPE: FROM DAY TO DAY THE DISPLACED ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CONTEMPT AND HUMILIATION. THE EFFECT IT HAS IS PERHAPS NOT APPRECIATED BY THE INHABITANT OF CALI, WHO, ON THE CONTRARY, SEES THEM AS A PROBLEM AND A SOCIAL BURDEN. HOWEVER, THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE IS OPPOSED TO THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS OF THOSE WHO NOW OCCUPY THEIR LANDS. CHARACTERISTICS: THE DISPLACED ARE FORCED TO CAMOUFLAGE THEMSELVES IN SOCIETY AND LEAVE BEHIND PRODUCTION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND LEARN TO EARN THEIR LIVING. SOCIETIES TRANSFORM, ESPECIALLY IN COLOMBIA FOR BEING A COUNTRY AT WAR. FINDINGS: THE SOCIAL REALITY THAT THE DISPLACED LIVE IN CALI AND THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS FOR GUIDING THE ATTITUDE AND HELP THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THESE COLOMBIANS WHO, DUE TO EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ARE FORCED TO KNOCK ON DOORS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A FINAL SOLUTION TO THEIR PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, IT WILL EXPAND THE VIEW OF THE COLOMBIAN VIS-A-VIS THE DISPLACED SO THAT IT IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE NEWS, BUT THAT ONCE ON THE STREET IS INVISIBLE TO THE CITIZEN. THE STATE MUST PREPARE ITSELF TO FACE THE NEW CHALLENGES POSED BY SOCIETY, DISPLACEMENT BEING ONE OF THEM. CONCLUSIONS: THE DISPLACED ARE PAID MORE ATTENTION WHEN THEY FLEE THAN WHEN THEY DIE.
570	THE PAPER TRIES TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A NARROW CONNECTION BETWEEN CONCEPTIONS OF THE LAW AND CONCEPTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL ETHICS. ESPECIALLY, IT SUPPORTS THAT THE FORMALIST (AND/OR POSITIVIST) CONCEPTIONS OF THE LAW TEND TO CONCEIVE THE JUDICIAL ETHICS AS A DIFFERENTIATED ETHICS RESPECT OF THE GENERAL ETHICS. ON THE CONTRARY, THE POSTPOSITIVIST CONCEPTIONS OF THE LAW TEND TO CONCEIVE THE JUDICIAL ETHICS AS AN APPLIED ETHICS.
571	CURRENTLY, RESEARCH ON THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IS FLOURISHING, AND MORE AND MORE ISSUES ARE WORTHY OF EXPLORATION. THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IS UNIQUE AMONG THE FIVE MAJOR LEGAL SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. IT IS THE ONLY ANCIENT SECULAR LEGAL SYSTEM, AND THE ONLY ANCIENT SECULAR LEGAL SYSTEM TO HAVE BEEN DISSEMINATED BY NON-COERCIVE MEANS. THE OPENNESS OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IS A POWERFUL PROOF THAT TRADITIONAL CHINESE LAW PLAYS A ROLE IN IMPORTING AND EXPORTING LEGAL POLICIES AND MEASURES FROM AND TO OTHER STATES. INDEED, THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT IN RESEARCH ON THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF THEM CAN HELP TO COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND TRADITIONAL CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEEPEN THE RESEARCH ON THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS REVIVAL AND TO THE INHERITANCE OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE. IN ADDITION TO COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSIONS, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO FILL GAPS AND ADVANCE THE RESEARCH ON THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM.
572	THE ARTICLE RECALLS THE TRIPLE-PRONGED NORMATIVE STRUCTURE OF FAMILIAR LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC THEORISTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, WHO ARGUED THAT CONSCIENTIOUS LAW-BREAKING SHOULD REST ON POLITICAL, MORAL AND LEGAL CLAIMS. IN OPPOSITION TO A CERTAIN TENDENCY AMONG RECENT THEORETICIANS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TO REDUCE THIS COMPLEX MULTI-PRONGED NORMATIVITY TO ONE OR TWO PRONGS (I.E. THE POLITICAL OR THE MORAL), I USE THE CASE OF EDWARD SNOWDEN'S WHISTLE-BLOWING TO ILLUSTRATE AND DEFEND THE TRIPLE-PRONGED APPROACH. IN PARTICULAR, ANY SOUND AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE MODEL OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE NEEDS TO HIGHLIGHT ITS LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS: CONSCIENTIOUS LAW-BREAKING SHOULD BE CONCEIVED AS ULTIMATELY RESTING ON - OR EXPRESSING BASIC FIDELITY TO - THE LAW OR LEGALITY. ONLY BY TAKING THIS LEGAL PRONG SERIOUSLY CAN CIVIL DISOBEDIENTS FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PLURALISTIC CHARACTER OF MODERN SOCIETIES. AGAINST SOME RADICAL CRITICS, I ARGUE THAT THIS LEGAL APPROACH DOES NOT IN FACT NECESSARILY FAVOR THE LEGAL OR POLITICAL STATUS QUO. DESPITE THE MANY STRENGTHS OF KIMBERLEY BROWNLEE'S MODEL OF CONSCIENTIOUS LAW-BREAKING, IT MISSES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGAL PRONG AND SOMETIMES RESTS ON A PROBLEMATIC ANTI-LEGALISM. CONSEQUENTLY, SHE OFFERS AN INCOMPLETE MODEL OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THAT CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAIN WHY SNOWDEN AND OTHERS WHOSE ACTIONS FALL UNDER THE RUBRIC OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE RELY SO EXTENSIVELY ON LEGAL ARGUMENTS.
573	IT IS OBSERVED IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT IN NATIONAL STATES AND FEATURES POWERFULLY WITHIN CONTEMPORARY 'GOOD-GOVERNANCE' PROMOTION IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH BY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (DFIS). HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW IS PREDOMINANTLY USED TO EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF STABILITY OF CONTRACT AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY IN CONNECTION WITH TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (TDPS) AND DOES NOT SO MUCH FOCUS ON THE GENERAL STABILITY OF (E.G. INDIGENOUS) RIGHTS, ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS. THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVIATE FROM A NARROW INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND INCLUDE THE ROLE OF ALL TYPES OF ACTORS IN SAFEGUARDING THIS RULE OF LAW.
574	THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE SOCIAL CRISIS IN ATHENS FACED BY SOLON DURING HIS ARCHONSHIP IN 594/3 BC. AFTER FOCUSING ON THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF ARISTOTLE AND PLUTARCH'S ACCOUNTS OF THE CRISIS, WE AIM TO REVIEW DIFFERENT APPROACHES OF MODERN SCHOLARSHIP TO THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN ATHENS. IN THE SECOND PART WE ARGUE TO WHAT EXTENT SOLON'S POEMS, PARTICULARLY FR. 36W, SHOW A POLITICAL RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOCIAL GROUPS THAT SOMEHOW TAKES THE SOCIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIAL GROUPS INTO THE REALM OF THE POLIS. THE WRITTEN LAW INTENDS TO MEDIATE THE INDIVIDUAL OR CLASS INTERESTS THAT, ULTIMATELY, HAVE LED TO STASIS, OR SOCIAL CONFLICT. IN CONCLUSION WE DRAW ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE EVENTS TO THE MODERN DEBATE ON THE RELATION BETWEEN POWER, VIOLENCE AND LAW.
575	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE MODEL OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN STATE AND THE ELEMENTS THAT COMPOSE IT, STARTING FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE THAT MAY EXIST IN THE RETRIBUTIVE MODEL AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. THE GENERALIZED CONCEPT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS STUDIED WITH RESPECT TO ITS INCIDENCE IN PRAXIS. THE MAIN RESULTS OF THE ANALYTICAL STUDY ALLOWED THE GENERATION OF A THEORETICAL AND LEGAL BASIS ON THE MODEL STUDIED, WHOSE CONCLUSIONS ARE AIMED AT EXPLAINING HOW RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR A TRUE PROCEDURAL MATERIALIZATION OF THE VICTIMS AND PERSONS INVOLVED IN A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS FOUND THAT THE MODEL ITSELF IS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT HAS ITS OWN BASES AND NORMATIVE DEVELOP-MENT WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN STATE, AS WELL AS A UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC JURISPRUDENTIAL BASIS.
576	DESPITE ITS LATE START, CHINA HAS BECOME THE WORLD'S LARGEST GREEN BOND MARKET IN A VERY SHORT TIME. THIS EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO ITS UNIQUE RULES SYSTEM, WHICH HAS ALSO MADE CHINA A 'GAME CHANGER' TO THE GREEN BOND MARKET. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO EXPLAIN THE GENERATION MECHANISM OF THE 'GAME CHANGER' BY COMPARING THE RULES SYSTEMS OF CHINA AND THE INTERNATIONAL GREEN BOND MARKET AND EXAMINING THE PARTICULARITIES OF CHINA'S FINANCIAL MARKET. UNLIKE THE INTERNATIONAL GREEN BOND MARKET, WITHIN WHICH 'SOFT LAWS' ARE FORMED FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND ARE DRIVEN BY INVESTORS' JOINT EFFORTS, STOCK EXCHANGES, INTERMEDIARIES, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, CHINA'S GREEN BOND MARKET IS PROVIDED WITH A TOP-DOWN SYSTEM OF RULES, WHICH ARE DOMINATED BY PUBLIC DEPARTMENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY MANIFESTS AS A SERIES OF 'HARD LAWS.' THESE RULES PROVIDE A VARIETY OF FAVORABLE MEASURES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF GREEN BONDS, AND GREATLY STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEWLY EMERGED PRODUCT UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE LIBERALIZATION OF CHINA'S BOND MARKET IS LIMITED AT PRESENT. NONETHELESS, THIS ARTICLE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT AMID EXISTING FINANCIAL MARKET AND REGULATION SYSTEMS IN CHINA, THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN BOND MARKETS NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE 'REGULATORY ARBITRAGE' BROUGHT ABOUT BY REGULATORY DECENTRALIZATION AND SHOULD OVERCOME THE IMPERFECTION OF IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS. THEREFORE, THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF GREEN BONDS SHOULD BE EXERCISED UNIFORMLY BY THE CSRC, AND AN EFFECTIVE CONSTRAINT AND DISCIPLINARY MECHANISM SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.
577	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE IMPACT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE RUINS OF PALMYRA LEADS VOLNEY TO PROJECT THE EXHUMATION OF THE MEANING OF RUINS IN GENERAL. THE RUINS THEN BECOME LIVING BEINGS FULL OF TEACHINGS. THESE INCLUDE, FIRST, THOSE RELATING TO EQUALITY (AND FREEDOM AND JUSTICE); AND ALSO, THE DIVINITY OF ITS AUTHOR, THAT IS, MAN AS THE UNIQUE SUBJECT OF HISTORY, THE ROMANTIC EXALTATION OF BEAUTY AND A WEAK PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY THAT RECORDS THE TERRIBLE POWER OF EVIL OVER TIME AND THAT MITIGATES FINALLY WITH AN ALLUSION TO PROGRESS AND ITS FORM OF FUTURE MANIFESTATION: THE LIBERAL STATE, WHICH WILL NO LONGER CEASE WITH TIME. OUR DISCUSSION EXPLORES THE PROFOUND CONTRADICTIONS OF HIS DISCOURSE: THE MORALIZATION OF HIS VISION OF THE RUINS, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY DISTORTS ITS MEANING; THE EXCUSE FOR A COLONIAL POLICY, WHICH DERIVES FROM ITS PROTECTION; THE AMBIGUOUS DESCRIPTION AS BARBARIANS OF THOSE WHO DESTROY THEM, APPLICABLE EQUALLY TO FANATICS AND ENLIGHTENED; THE NAIVE MORALISTIC VISION OF THE ROLE OF EVIL IN HISTORY OR THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE END OF HISTORY, EMBODIED IN THE UNIVERSAL STATE OF LAW FOR WHICH FRANCE WILL ACT AS A GUIDE, AND ITS INCISIVE CRITICISM OF REAL EUROPE AND FRANCE.
578	THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE HIDDEN CONNECTION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN BALANCING AND THE LIVING CONSTITUTION. IN THIS RESPECT, ACCEPTING BALANCING AS A MECHANISM OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION ASSUMES THE NEED TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE CONSTITUTION AS A LIVING INSTRUMENT. IN EFFECT, BALANCING REQUIRES A MODEL OF CONSTITUTION FLEXIBLE AND MOLDABLE, STANDARD THAT THE LIVING CONSTITUTION PRECISELY PROMOTES. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THIS CONNECTION BY DESCRIBING THE EXPERIENCE OF AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AT THE END OF THE XIX CENTURY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE XX CENTURY. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR POINTS OUT THE TENSIONS THAT THE BINOMIAL BALANCING-LIVING CONSTITUTION INTRODUCES WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONALISM.
579	NOWADAYS, THE RIGHT TO A BALANCED ENVIRONMENT IS ESTABLISHED BY SEVERAL STUDIES. THIS RIGHT IT'S A KEY FOR THE OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS TO BE CONCRETIZED, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO HEALTH, ADEQUATE HOUSING, PRIVACY AND DIGNITY. THUS AT THE INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AS IN THE CASE OF BRAZIL, IT ADOPTS AND APPROVES THE RIGHT TO ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENT AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. THOSE COUNTRIES WHO ADOPT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION STANDARDS, CONCERNING FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS, ARE KNOWN AS SOCIO-DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW. NEVERTHELESS, ISSUES SUCH AS MISMANAGEMENT AND CORRUPTION STOP THESE RIGHTS FROM MATERIALIZING, LEADING TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES, VIOLATING RIGHTS GUARANTEED AS FUNDAMENTAL IN THE CONSTITUTION AND STIRRING AWAY FROM THE FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRACY.
580	SOUTH AFRICA IS TORN BETWEEN THE PERSISTENCE OF AN EXCLUSIONARY SOCIOECONOMIC STRUCTURE MARKED BY DEEP POVERTY AND EXTREME INEQUALITY ON THE ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER THE SYMBOLIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RUPTURE PRESENTED BY THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY. THIS RELATIONSHIP PRODUCES A HIGHLY UNSTABLE SOCIAL ORDER IN WHICH INTRA-ELITE CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE ARE GROWING, CHARACTERISED BY NEW FORMS OF VIOLENCE AND THE REPRODUCTION OF OLDER PATTERNS OF VIOLENCE, A SOCIAL ORDER THAT CAN BE CHARACTERISED AS VIOLENT DEMOCRACY. I ANALYSE THREE DIFFERENT FORMS OF SUCH VIOLENCE - THE STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF COERCION, ASSASSINATION, AND THE MOBILISATION OF COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE. THE PREVAILING FORMS OF POLITICS MAY SHIFT QUITE EASILY BETWEEN AUTHORITARIANISM, CLIENTELISM AND POPULISM, AND INDEED EXHIBIT ELEMENTS OF ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME. VIOLENT PRACTICES ACCOMPANY EACH OF THESE POLITICAL FORMS, AS VIOLENCE REMAINS A CRITICAL RESOURCE IN A STRUGGLE FOR ASCENDANCY WHICH DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE UNABLE TO REGULATE.
581	TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IS A CRIME AND A HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION THAT AFFECTS MOST STATES ACROSS THE GLOBE, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE COMMONWEALTH CARIBBEAN. THEREFORE, IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, GOVERNMENTS HAVE RUSHED TO ENACT ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAWS WITH A LEVEL OF ALACRITY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. WHILE THE ENACTMENT OF THESE LAWS IS BOTH NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE, SOME HAVE PUSHED THE LIMITS OF WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE IN A FREE AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME OF THE PROSECUTION PROVISIONS OF ANTI-TRAFFICKING NORMS ENACTED BY CARIBBEAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENCROACHED OR THREATEN TO ENCROACH UPON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ACCUSED PERSONS. IT CONDUDES THAT UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS OF REGIONAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAWS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS AS A MATTER OF URGENCY, AS THEY CAN POTENTIALLY BE CHALLENGED BY TRAFFICKERS WITH THE RESULT BEING THAT, IF SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED, TRAFFICKERS MAY ESCAPE LIABILITY FOR CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED ON MERE TECHNICALITIES.
582	WE ARE AT A CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET. NATION STATES AROUND THE WORLD ARE LAUNCHING MAJOR NEW INITIATIVES TO REGULATE THE INTERNET, BOTH DIRECTLY AGAINST USERS AND BY REGULATING THE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTENT SERVICES. THE GIANT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT CONTROL THE BULK OF THE COMMERCIAL INTERNET ARE THEMSELVES UNDER UNPRECEDENTED SCRUTINY FOR THE POLICIES THEY SET, THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE, AND THE CHOICES THAT GO INTO DESIGNING THEIR ARCHITECTURE. IN MY NEW BOOK, LAWLESS, I ARGUE THAT IN THIS MOMENT OF CHANGE THERE IS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY FOR US ALL TO RETHINK HOW THE INTERNET SHOULD BE GOVERNED, HOW POWER IS HELD TO ACCOUNT, AND WHOSE VALUES PREVAIL.(1) (C) 2019 NICOLAS SUZOR.

583	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PERTINENCE OF RELIGIOUS DISCOURSES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. HE EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR NORMATIVE REINSERTION OF RELIGIOUS DISCOURSES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE COMMON IDEAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS DESIGN IS PRESENTED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONTEMPORANEITY AND THE OBSERVATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE RELIGIONS TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE OBJECTIVE OF FRATERNITY AND SOLIDARITY BETWEEN THE CITIZENS WITH DIFFERENT AXIOLOGICAL ORIENTATIONS. JURGEN HABERMAS'S DISCOURSE THEORY ANALYZES THAT CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES ARE EXPERIENCING THE POST-SECULARIZATION PROCESS AND THE RESURGENCE OF RELIGIONS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHER BELIEVES THAT RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS HAVE THE NORMATIVE CONTENT AND LEGITIMACY THAT IS LACKING IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND POLITICAL ACTORS. THE WORLD RELIGIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SOCIAL ACTIONS AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF SOLIDARITY WITH THEIR FAITHFUL. AT THE POST-METAPHYSICAL LEVEL OF GROUNDING OF THE POLITICAL FORM, RELIGIOUS DISCOURSES CAN MOTIVATE CITIZENS TO COMMUNICATIVE ATTITUDE AND UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL NORMS THAT SHOULD GOVERN A JUST AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY. IN THIS SENSE, THE EXPERIENCE OF SELF-ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE RELIGIONS ON THEIR DOCTRINES AND PRINCIPLES OF FAITH CAN COLLABORATE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN RELIGIOUS AND NON-RELIGIOUS CITIZENS. FINALLY, THE ANALYSIS OF THE CATHOLIC EXPERIENCE OF SELF-REFLECTION ON ITS DOCTRINES AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE VARIOUS RELIGIONS HAS BECOME THE EXAMPLE OF DIALOGUE FOR RELIGIOUS ENTITIES IN THE SECULAR WORLD.
584	MICRO AND MACRO LEVEL IMPACTS OF OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING ARE FAR FROM CLEAR. THUS THERE ARE SOME WELL-FOUNDED RATIONALES FOR AND AGAINST OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF MISINFORMED AND ILL GUIDED VIEWPOINTS. USING INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AS A LENS, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE DRIVERS OF OFFSHORE BUSINESS PROCESS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING. WE EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH REGULATIVE RULES, SOCIAL RULES, CULTURALLY SUPPORTED HABITS AND SUBCONSCIOUSLY ACCEPTED RULES AND CUSTOMS INFLUENCE ASSESSMENT, SELECTION AS WELL AS CONTINUATION OF OUTSOURCING PROJECTS. MANAGERIAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED. (C) 2007 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
585	THE ALTERNATIVES TO THE JUDICIALIZATION OF THE INTERSUBJECTIVE CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS PROLIFERATE STIMULATED BY THE NEED TO OFFER AGILE SOLUTIONS TO THE LITIGATION, AND TO FACE ALSO FOR THIS ROUTE THE PROBLEMATICS GENERATED BY THE COLLAPSE OF THE JURISDICTIONAL ORGANS. THE INTRAJUDICIAL MEDIATION RECEIVES A PROTAGONISM EMPHASIZED BETWEEN THE ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROCESS, VERY RELEVANT IN THE AREA OF THE CIVIL JURISDICTION, GAINS PROGRESSIVELY AREA IN THE FRAME OF THE PENAL JURISDICTION. NEVERTHELESS THE CONTENTIOUS - ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION HAS NOT TURNED OUT TO BE TRADITIONALLY RECEPTIVE TO THIS FORMULA. THIS WORK PROPOSES TO ANALYZE THE DIFFICULTIES THAT AVOID IN THIS ORDER THE SUCCESS OF THE ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO THE JUDICIALIZATION OF THE CONFLICT, AS WELL AS TO EXPLORE THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY THAT COULD BE MORE FAVOURABLE TO A TREATY SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE.
586	OVER RECENT DECADES A JUDICIALIZATION PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES HAS TAKEN PLACE. YET, THE JUDICIALIZATION OF PROCEDURES REMAINS MEANINGLESS IF THE PROCEDURES ARE NOT USED AND ACCEPTED BY DISPUTING STATES IN PRACTICE. PROMINENT THEORETICAL APPROACHES POINT TO DIFFERENT CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED. REALISM EMPHASIZES THE INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF POWER, INSTITUTIONALISM STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES, AND LIBERALISM POINTS TO THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL SETTING OF THE PARTICIPATING STATES. THE ARTICLE CONFRONTS THESE THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS WITH STATES' ACTUAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOR IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGIME, THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME AND THE REGIME ON THE PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE 1970S/80S AND 1990S/2000S, RESPECTIVELY. ITS MAIN FINDING IS THAT, COMPARED TO REALISM AND LIBERALISM, INSTITUTIONALISM FARES BETTER IN EXPLAINING THE JUDICIALIZATION OF STATES' DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOR.
587	ALBERT VENN DICEY'S LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOKS ON PUBLIC LAW IN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION-BUT IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD. DICEY IS GENERALLY THOUGHT TO HAVE ADOPTED AN ANALYTICAL OR POSITIVIST METHOD WITH A VIEW TO CODIFYING THE UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION AS A SET OF RULES, BUT THIS CHARACTERIZATION OF HIS WORK SITS UNEASILY WITH THE BOOK'S COMPARATIVE AND HISTORICAL REFERENCES AND ITS UNDERLYING 'WHIG' POLITICS. LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION IS THEREFORE THOUGHT TO BE THEORETICALLY CONFUSED OR EVEN DUPLICITOUS AND OF LITTLE VALUE TO LAWYERS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS TODAY. THIS ESSAY CHALLENGES THIS VIEW OF DICEY AND HIS FAMOUS BOOK. IT EXAMINES DICEY'S UNPUBLISHED LECTURE NOTES AND PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE AS WELL AS HIS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS AS A LEGAL SCHOLAR AND WRITER IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY DICEY'S OWN IDEAS ABOUT THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF HIS WORK. THE RESULT IS A 'DICEY' THAT MIGHT NOT BE RECOGNIZED TODAY-ONE WHO EMBRACED A LEGAL THEORY THAT INTEGRATED ANALYTICAL, HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE AND NORMATIVE ELEMENTS OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION TOGETHER THROUGH DISCURSIVE NARRATIVES ABOUT GENERAL PRINCIPLES. READ AS AN INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN A TEXTBOOK OF LEGAL RULES, LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION REGAINS ITS THEORETICAL COHERENCE AND IT MAY OFFER VALUABLE LESSONS FOR UNDERSTANDING CONSTITUTIONALISM TODAY.
588	AT THE HEART OF THE TENSION BETWEEN STATE AUTONOMY AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER STATES SHOULD WILLINGLY RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM OF ACTION FOR THE SAKE OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, TRADE, COMMUNICATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. DAVID HUME OFFERS SURPRISING INSIGHTS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. HE ARGUES THAT THE SAME INTERESTS IN COOPERATION ARISE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS STATES AND THAT THEIR INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE SAME PRINCIPLES. DRAWING ON HIS MODEL OF DYNAMIC COORDINATION, I WILL RECONSTRUCT THE HUMEAN CASE FOR DEVELOPING INTERNATIONAL LAW INTO A MORE ROBUST LEGAL SYSTEM AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE LIMITATION OF HUME'S ACCOUNT OF JUSTICE FOR SUCH A RECONSTRUCTIVE PROJECT. HUME'S LESSONS ARE ENDURING; WE MUST STRENGTHEN THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT ALLOW STATES AND INDIVIDUALS TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF ITS PROTECTIONS, SUCH AS NONOPTIONAL RULES THAT ARTICULATE A MORAL MINIMUM, COURTS WITH COMPULSORY JURISDICTION, AND STRONGER MECHANISMS OF ENFORCEMENT.
589	WHILE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT POLITICS MATTER FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC INTEGRATION OF THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN GIVEN SHORT SHRIFT IN THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE. I ARGUE THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS RAISES THE QUANTITY AND THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO POTENTIAL MEMBER STATES DURING THE BARGAINING PHASE OF A TRADE AGREEMENT. IN TURN, THIS INFLOW OF INFORMATION REDUCES THE NEGOTIATION PERIOD OF AN AGREEMENT AND, IN DOING SO, DAMPENS THE TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. AS A RESULT, COUNTRIES WITH GOOD INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO FORM TRADE AGREEMENTS. USING ORIGINAL DATA ON BOTH THE FORMATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS AND THE DURATION OF NEGOTIATIONS, I QUANTITATIVELY TEST THIS ARGUMENT. THE RESULTS STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IS A CRUCIAL DRIVER IN EXPLAINING THE RECENT WAVE OF REGIONALISM.
590	NATIONAL IDENTITY IS A LEGAL CATEGORY OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW WHICH IS BEING CONTROVERSIALLY INTERPRETED IN A SOVEREIGNTIST VEIN BY SOME POLITICAL LEADERS AS WELL AS BY CERTAIN NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IN RECENT YEARS. WE ARE WITNESSING A RECENT JUDICIAL TREND IN LINE WITH THE RISE OF AUTOCRATIC AND POPULIST POLITICAL MOVEMENTS WHICH DEFEND A MODEL OF ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN OUR CONTINENT, PARTICULARLY IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. IT IS THEREFORE HELD AN EXTENSIVE CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY SEEKING TO ARTICULATE AN ABSOLUTE AND IMPONDERABLE MECHANISM OF NATIONAL RESISTANCE TO THE ACTION OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CRITICALLY ANALYSE THIS NATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE, WHICH RAISES SERIOUS DOUBTS OF COMPATIBILITY WITH A HISTORICAL, LITERAL AND SYSTEMATIC INTERPRETATION OF THE TREATIES, ESPECIALLY WITH THE VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. TO THIS END, A STUDY OF THE ORIGINS AND HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THIS PROVISION, A CATEGORISATION OF THE NOTION OF NATIONAL IDENTITY, A NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS, AND THE CONCEPT OF EUROPEAN IDENTITY WILL BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO QUESTION THE DEFLECTED JURISPRUDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PROMOTED BY SOME NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS FROM EASTERN EUROPE.
591	RIGHTS ARE THE BACKBONE OF BOTH THE CONCEPT OF POWER CONTROL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIFIC THEORY OF STATE LEGITIMACY: THE LIBERAL MODEL. IN THE COLOMBIAN CASE, THE DRAFTING OF THE 1991 CONSTITUTION BROUGHT ABOUT A DIFFERENT FORM OF STATE MODEL. THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT EXAMINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS RIGHTS MODEL, ITS CONFIGURATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFINITION. TO THIS END, THE ROLE OF POLITICAL FORMULA AND THE VALUES OF THE 1991 CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM ARE ADDRESSED FIRST. THEN, THE PROBLEM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IS EXPLORED, WHICH NOT ONLY ESTABLISHES A DISCOURSE TO SUBSTANTIATE THE POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO ENABLES THE VERY EXERCISE OF RIGHTS. FINALLY, RIGHTS ARE DEFINED WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONTEMPORARY LEGAL THEORY.
592	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE WIDESPREAD AND EQUIVOCAL DIAGNOSIS THAT ATTRIBUTES THE FAILURE OF THE JUSTICE REFORM AND THE CRISIS OF VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY IN MEXICO TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM'S BROKEN INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL DESIGN. USING CONCEPTS FROM BOTH POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY, AND THROUGH A HISTORICAL REINTERPRETATION OF THE PLACE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL COLLAPSE AND THE INABILITY OF THE STATE TO CONTROL CRIMINAL VIOLENCE ARE THE RESULT OF THE PERSISTENT POLITICAL SUBORDINATION OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE EXECUTIVE POWER, OF ITS DELIBERATE INSTITUTIONAL PRECARIOUSNESS AND ITS CAPTURE BY PRIVATE INTERESTS AND CRIMINAL ACTORS. THE STRUCTURAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN REPRODUCED IN THE CYCLE OF THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, AND HAS WORSENED IN THE CONTEXT OF A CONSERVATIVE FEDERAL ARRANGEMENT CONSTITUTED BY SUBNATIONAL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO A GENUINE REFORM OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.
593	SINCE THE 2010S, BOTTOM-UP ANTI-CORRUPTION MOBILIZATIONS HAVE BROKEN OUT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OF SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE. BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA IN 2014 AND MACEDONIA IN 2015 AND 2016 WERE AMONGST THE STATES IN DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC TRANSITION IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS TO EXPRESS THEIR DISCONTENT AGAINST A RULING CLASS BLAMED FOR CORRUPTION. ALTHOUGH TRIGGERED BY DIFFERENT EVENTS, THESE MOBILIZATIONS PRESENT A NUMBER OF SIMILARITIES. BUILDING ON QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS AND ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATION OF INTERACTIONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE DISCURSIVE STRATEGIES THAT MOVEMENT ORGANIZERS USED TO FRAME THEIR CLAIMS AND THE PROTESTORS' IDENTITY IN BOTH COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WAYS IN WHICH PROTEST LEADERS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES APPROPRIATED THE TOPIC OF CORRUPTION "FROM BELOW" TO DELEGITIMIZE THE RULING CLASS USING SIMILAR MOTIVATIONAL, IDENTITY AND DIAGNOSTIC FRAMES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROTESTS BEING SPURRED BY DIVERSE EVENTS. FURTHERMORE, IT ELUCIDATES THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AMONG THE PROGNOSTIC FRAMES, THAT IS, THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION.
594	LIKE COURTS IN DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, COURTS UNDER AUTHORITARIANISM PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF COMPLEX ECONOMIES. IN PARTICULAR, SCHOLARS SUGGEST THAT AUTHORITARIAN JUDICIARIES ARE COMMONLY ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATION IN THE CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC DISPUTES BETWEEN FIRMS. YET BECAUSE REGIME INSIDERS ARE OFTEN CONNECTED TO FIRMS, JUDGES HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES TO CONSIDER THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR DECISIONS EVEN IN AREAS OF THE LAW WHERE THEY ARE ALLEGEDLY MORE INDEPENDENT. IN THIS ARTICLE, I PROPOSE A NEW THEORY ABOUT THE ROLE OF CORPORATIONS' POLITICAL BACKGROUND IN COMMERCIAL LAWSUITS. USING A DATA SET ON THE LITIGATION OUTCOMES OF FIRMS IN CHINA, I FIND THAT THE COMPOSITION OF A FIRM'S BOARD MEMBERSHIP IS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF ITS LAWSUIT OUTCOMES. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF CORPORATE BOARD MEMBERS WITH POLITICAL CONNECTIONS LEADS TO A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF LAWSUIT SUCCESS. THE RESULTS POINT TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE SELECTIVE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THEORY.
595	THE DRAFT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW << TO PROTECT THE NATION >> PRESENTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN PARIS ON 13TH NOVEMBER 2015 HAD AS AN AIM TO INCLUDE IN THE CONSTITUTION THE NOTION OF STATE OF URGENCY AND TO EXTEND DEPRIVATION OF NATIONALITY TO FRENCH BY BIRTH. THIS TWO FACES OF THE GOVERNMENT DRAFT WERE THE ORIGIN OF AN INTENSE POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE. FIRSTLY, THIS DEBATE FOCUSED ON THE PRINCIPLE CONSISTING ON INCLUDING IN THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE OF URGENCY, WHICH IS AN EXCEPTION STATE WHOSE ORIGIN IS IN THE 3RD APRIL 1955 ACT. MOREOVER, THE QUESTION OF DURATION OF THE STATE OF URGENCY WAS ALSO DISCUSSED: DOES THIS EXCEPTION STATE RISK GIVING BIRTH TO A << STATE OF NECESSITY >> THAT THE TERRORIST THREAT TENDS TO MAKE PERMANENT? THE EXTENSION OF DEPRIVATION OF NATIONALITY TO FRENCH BY BIRTH HAS ALSO BEEN HIGHLY DISCUSSED REGARDING THE OPPORTUNITY OF ITS INCLUSION IN THE CONSTITUTION AND ITS MODALITIES. PARTICULARLY, BOTH CHAMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WERE NOT ABLE TO AGREE ON THE ISSUE OF STATELESSNESS. THEY HAVE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN A CONTRADICTION WHICH, APART FROM POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, FINALLY EXPLAINS THE FAILURE OF THE DRAFT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: WAS THERE NEED TO MAKE PREVAIL A STRICT EQUALITY AMONG FRENCH WITH AN ONLY NATIONALITY AND THOSE WITH SEVERAL NATIONALITIES AND ASSUME THE RISK OF STATELESSNESS, OR WAS THERE NEED TO PREVENT THE RISK OF STATELESSNESS AND TREAT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY?
596	ON THE BASIS OF DATA OBTAINED FROM A COMPREHENSIVE SOCIAL SURVEY ACROSS TWENTY-EIGHT PROVINCES, MUNICIPALITIES AND AUTONOMOUS REGIONS IN 2005 (CGSS2005), WE HAVE CONDUCTED QUANTITATIVE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTES AND CHINESE CITIZENS' PURPOSIVE INSTITUTIONAL CHOICES IN DEALING WITH SUCH DISPUTES. OUR STUDY FOUND THAT WHERE ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTES ARE CONCERNED, TODAY'S CHINESE CITIZENS ARE BY NO MEANS APATHETIC ABOUT THE LAW. HOWEVER, PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS MEAN THAT SOME OF THEM RESORT TO OTHER MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION THAN JUDICIAL OR QUASI-JUDICIAL PROCEDURES. IN ACTUALITY, A TWO-TRACK SYSTEM EXISTS IN CHINESE CITIZENS' RESOLUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTES; THAT IS, THEY HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR (QUASI-) JUDICIAL CHANNELS AND FOR PARTY/GOVERNMENT CHANNELS IN THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES OF THIS KIND. IN ADDITION, DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS SHOW A GREAT VARIETY OF PREFERENCES IN TERMS OF CHOICE OF CHANNELS FOR DEALING WITH SUCH DISPUTES. ON THE BASIS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WE ARGUE FOR FURTHER REFLECTION ON THE THEORY AND METHODOLOGY OF THIS KIND OF RESEARCH TODAY AND CALL ON THEORETICAL RESEARCH AND INSTITUTION BUILDING TO SHOW A GENUINE UNDERSTANDING OF AND RESPECT FOR CITIZENS' WISHES.
597	THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW RECENT CHANGES IN CHINA'S LEGAL CULTURE ARE BEING INFLUENCED BY THE TWO PHILOSOPHIES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE CURRENTLY EMPHASISED BY THE COUNTRY'S LEADERSHIP; THAT IS, THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL HARMONY. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, THE ARTICLE UNCOVERS THE ESSENCE OF CHINA'S CURRENT LEGAL CULTURE - THAT IS, THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL HARMONY, AND ANALOGISES IT WITH THE ALLOY OF CONFUCIANISM AND LEGALISM IN DYNASTIC CHINA. THIS ARTICLE POS ITS THAT THE EFFORT TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW ('CPL) (2012) COMPLETES THE TRANSITION OF CHINA'S LEGAL CULTURE BECAUSE IT ACCOMPLISHES A SUBSTANTIVE MIXTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL HARMONY. THE ARTICLE THEN SCRUTINISES THE CPL AMENDMENTS BY CLASSIFYING THEM INTO TWO GROUPS IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR MAIN FUNCTIONS - THAT IS, TO CONSOLIDATE THE RULE OF LAW AND TO LEGALISE SOCIAL HARMONY - AND DISCUSSES HOW THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL HARMONY ARE FURTHER PROMOTED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THROUGH THE FIRST-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CPL. A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF THE QUESTIONS ARISING FROM THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL HARMONY UNDER THE CPL - WHICH TOUCHES UPON THE BASIS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND EVEN THE ENTIRE LEGAL REGIME - PRECEDES THE CONCLUSION OF THE ARTICLE.
598	OWNERSHIP IS NOT LIKELY TO STAND OUT IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS AS EITHER THE MOST CENTRAL OR THE MOST ILLUMINATING CASE OF AN OFFICE. AND, YET, I WILL ARGUE IN THIS ARTICLE THAT THE IDEA OF OWNERSHIP AS AN OFFICE IS ESPECIALLY REVEALING OF A TENSION BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF AN OFFICE AND THE NORMATIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF OFFICES IN A LEGAL ORDER, A TENSION THAT PROPERTY LAW RESOLVES IN A PARTICULARLY REVEALING WAY WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP. THE TENSION BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF OFFICE AND ITS NORMATIVE SIGNIFICANCE AMOUNTS TO THIS: WHEREAS OFFICES ARE ALWAYS CAPABLE OF VACANCY BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPERSONAL POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY SEPARABLE FROM THE OFFICE-HOLDER, THE LAW ABHORS VACANCIES IN PRINCIPLE. IN EARLIER ARTICLES, I HAVE EXPLAINED HOW HORROR VACUI MOTIVATES PROPERTY LAW'S CONCERN 'TO SEE THAT THE OFFICE OF OWNERSHIP IS FILLED.' IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY VACANCY IN OFFICE AMOUNTS TO A DEFECT IN THE LEGAL ORDER ITSELF - IN BRIEF, BECAUSE VACANCY UNDERMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS AND, ULTIMATELY, THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW AS A SYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING AUTHORITY. I WILL ARGUE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR VACANCY IN OFFICES COMBINED WITH LAW'S HORROR VACUI LEADS TO POSSESSION AS A DEFAULT PROCEDURE FOR APPOINTMENT TO OFFICES, IN GENERAL, AND THE OFFICE OF OWNERSHIP, IN PARTICULAR.
599	IN 1953, CONGRESS SUPPLANTED THE TRIBAL CIVIL LAW ON SOME AMERICAN-INDIAN RESERVATIONS WITH THE CIVIL LAW OF THE US STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED. IN THE VEIN OF CROSS-NATIONAL LITERATURE ON LAW AND FINANCE, I DEMONSTRATE THAT CONGRESS'S ACTION REDUCED EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ACTORS' UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS ON SOME RESERVATIONS. USING NOVEL DATA ON 20,000 HOME LOANS TO TRIBAL MEMBERS GUARANTEED BY A US HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (1996-2013), I FIND A CAUSAL EFFECT AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL: MORTGAGE HOLDERS GOVERNED BY US STATE CIVIL LAW PAY CONSISTENTLY LOWER INTEREST RATES. THUS, EXTERNALLY IMPOSED LAW GENERATES LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS. NONETHELESS, QUALITATIVE EXTENSIONS SUGGEST THAT NEITHER THE PRESENCE NOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT OFFSETS MANY TRIBES' PRIORITIZATION OF THEIR SOVEREIGNTY, RATHER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT CAN RESULT FROM COMPROMISING IT.
600	NEARLY EVERY READER OF JAMES HARRINGTON HAS TAKEN HIS THEORY THAT PROPERTY IS THE FOUNDATION OF GOVERNMENT TO BE HIS CENTRAL AND MOST ENDURING CONTRIBUTION TO POLITICAL THOUGHT. OPERATING WITHIN THIS STANDARD READING, MOST OF THE EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ON HARRINGTON HAS FOCUSED ON DERIVATIVE ISSUES, SUCH AS THE ACCURACY AND DEPTH OF HIS ECONOMIC READING OF ENGLISH HISTORY, OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH HIS MECHANISTIC ACCOUNT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS DISPLACED MORE TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTS OF CIVIC VIRTUE. BUT THE STANDARD READING IS INCOMPLETE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS PUZZLING ON THIS READING WHY HARRINGTON SHOULD SINGLE OUT THOMAS HOBBES AS HIS CHIEF OPPONENT. TO DEMONSTRATE THE INCOMPLETENESS OF THE STANDARD READING, THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE A RELATIVELY NEGLECTED ASPECT OF OCEANA: NAMELY, THE SHARP CONTRAST DRAWN THROUGHOUT THE WORK BETWEEN THOSE COMMUNITIES ORGANIZED AS AN EMPIRE OF LAWS AND THOSE ORGANIZED AS AN EMPIRE OF MEN. AS IT TURNS OUT, HARRINGTON STRIKES UPON A DEEP PROBLEM, NOT NOTICED BY PREVIOUS AUTHORS IN THE CLASSICAL REPUBLICAN TRADITION, BUT NEVERTHELESS LYING AT THE VERY CONCEPTUAL CORE OF REPUBLICAN THEORY. EXAMINING THIS PROBLEM IN DETAIL IS BOTH INTERESTING IN ITS OWN RIGHT, IN SO FAR AS IT SHEDS LIGHT ON SOME CENTRAL ISSUES IN REPUBLICAN THEORY, AND IN THE RENEWED HISTORICAL APPRECIATION IT BRINGS TO OUR READING OF HARRINGTON AS WELL.
601	ONE OF THE UNEXPECTED EFFECTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN POLAND THAT BEGAN AT THE TURN OF 2015 IS THE EXPANSION OF DIFFUSE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF STATUTES. THE POLISH CONSTITUTION ADOPTS A CENTRALISED MODEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW, BUT IN THE CASES THEY HEAR COMMON COURTS STILL INDEPENDENTLY DISAPPLY STATUTES THAT VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS. THEIR STATED GROUNDS FOR DOING SO FOCUS ON THE NEED TO ACT IN THE PLACE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL, WHICH HAS LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM THE POLITICAL POWER. AS WELL AS THE NECESSITY OF CONTINUED EFFECTIVE PRESERVATION OF THE CONSTITUTION'S PRIMACY AND OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THIS NEW JUDICIAL PRACTICE, DESCRIBES THE RATIONALE FOR ITS ADOPTION AND ANALYSES ITS CONSEQUENCES FROM THE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE. THE TREND IS CAPABLE OF BEING DESCRIBED IN THEORETICAL TERMS, WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THIS ARTICLE'S RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS THAT THE COURTS' ACTIVITIES ARE CHANGING THE LAW-IN-ACTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW IN POLAND, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMULATION AND ACTIVATION OF A DEFENSIVE MECHANISM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
602	WHILE MUCH OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON CORRUPTION LOOKS AT THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION ON MACRO VARIABLES SUCH AS GROWTH RATES AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A DEPARTURE BY FOCUSSING ON VICTIMS OF CORRUPTION BY USING MICRODATA TO COMPARE CIVILIAN AND BUSINESS CORRUPTION. THIS STUDY FINDS THAT BUSINESSES FACE A STRONGER INCIDENCE OF BRIBE DEMANDS THAN INDIVIDUALS. THOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DETERMINANTS OF THE TWO FORMS OF BRIBE VICTIMIZATION, THERE ARE ALSO SOME SIMILARITIES. POLICIES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE DIFFERENCES AND THE SIMILARITIES.
603	THIS PAPER ARGUES AGAINST A THESIS OF FERNANDO ATRIA THAT CONSIDERS (NEO)CONSTITUTIONALISM TO BE A PRE-MODERN LAW THAT PARTICIPATES IN A CYCLE OF APPLICATION OF LAW THAT HE CALLS "ARBITRARINESS TO PERFECTION". THERE ARE TWO OBJECTIONS TO THIS THESIS. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF MEN AND THE GOVERNMENT OF LAWS WHICH, ACCORDING TO AGUILO, IS A DISTINCTION THAT TENDS TO BE EXAGGERATED; WHILE, FOR ATIENZA, THE IDEA OF THE GOVERNMENT OF LAWS PRESUPPOSES A FORMALIST RATIONALITY, WHEN IT COULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH A MORE OPEN FORM OF RATIONALITY. THE SECOND OBJECTION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT ALSO PRESUPPOSES THAT THE ONLY ENDS THAT COUNT IN LAW ARE THE ENDS OF LAW ITSELF (CERTAINTY, PREDICTABILITY) AND NOT THE ENDS OF POLITICS. I SHOW HOW MODERN LAW HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT PURSUES AND MUST PURSUE OTHER ENDS (PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, REDISTRIBUTION, WELFARE, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, AMONG OTHERS). FINALLY, I SUSTAIN THAT THE JUDGE IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL OR POST-POSITIVIST MODEL DOES NOT HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF ARBITRARILY CHOOSING TO RESOLVE BY PONDERING OR TO RESOLVE BY APPLYING RULES, AS SUGGESTED BY THE THESIS OF ARBITRARINESS TO PERFECTION.
604	STATE CAPACITY HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DISCUSSED CONCEPTS IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL ECONOMY. IN THIS SURVEY WE ARGUE THAT THE STUDY OF ECONOMIC HISTORY PROVIDES VITAL INSIGHTS INTO THE PROCESS THROUGH WHICH MODEM STATES HAVE ACQUIRED 'STATE CAPACITY'. BY EVALUATING THE PROCESS OF STATE BUILDING ACROSS A RANGE OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA, WE ARE ABLE TO 'DECOMPRESS' THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE CAPACITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. OUR ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES THE VARIEGATED NATURE OF THE STATE BUILDING PROCESS. WE FOCUS ON RECENT RESEARCH THAT HELPS TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS THAT RELATE STATE CAPACITY TO ECONOMIC GROWTH.
605	THE STUDY OF THE DOCTRINE OF THE OMBUDSMAN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND ADEQUATE TO THE SOCIAL REALITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN GENERAL AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN PARTICULAR. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE MODEL OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS' PROTECTION DEVELOPED BY THE OMBUDSMAN, WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS EMPHASIZES THE ORIGINALITY OF THE CONTROL PARAMETER. THEN PROPOSES A SYSTEMATIZATION OF ITS FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN FOUR CATEGORIES AND SUMMARIZES THE ESSENTIAL CONTENT OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS, IN DIALOGUE WITH MODERN TRENDS OF THE THEORY OF RIGHTS. IT CONCLUDES WITH A PROPOSAL FOR THE FUTURE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TASK UNDERTAKEN BY THE OMBUDSMAN, BASED ON INCREASED SUPPORT OF ITS MODES OF ARGUMENT IN THE THEORY OF RIGHTS.
606	CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS STAND AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS, AS THE NEWLY FORMED RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT EXEMPLIFIED DURING RUSSIA'S TIME OF TROUBLES BETWEEN 1991 AND 1993. ONE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CASE FROM THAT PERIOD HAD PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. THE RUSSIAN COURT CONSIDERED THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION (CPSU) AND THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (CP RSFSR). THE SEVEN MONTH LONG HEARING TESTED THE COURT'S STAMINA AND RESOLVE. DESCRIBED BEFORE IT BEGAN AS 'RUSSIA'S NUREMBERG', WAS THE COMMUNIST PARTY CASE A TURNING POINT IN RUSSIA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PAST, OR WAS IT A STAGED SHOWPIECE WITH NO REAL IMPACT? THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S LONGEST CASE AND ITS EFFECTS. (C) 2007 THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
607	THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IS ENSHRINED IN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LAW AROUND THE WORLD. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THE SIMPLE ARGUMENT THAT THE FOCUS ON THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE RATE OF PROSECUTIONS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS SHOULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF ALLEGED TRAFFICKERS' RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL, AS A FAILURE TO UPHOLD FAIR TRIAL RIGHTS PLACES THEM AT RISK OF UNFAIR PROSECUTION. I CONSIDER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL LEGAL REGIME REGULATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL PROVIDES FOR THESE FAIR TRIAL RIGHTS, SUGGEST THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSES OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW EXIST IN A STATE OF TENSION AGAINST THE AIMS OF THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME, AND CONCLUDE THAT FURTHER EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE LEGAL EXPERIENCES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS IS NECESSARY.
608	THIS ARTICLE RESPONDS TO WILLIAM SCHEUERMAN'S ANALYSIS OF EDWARD SNOWDEN AS SOMEONE WHOSE ACTS FIT WITHIN JOHN RAWLS' ACCOUNT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE UNDERSTOOD AS A PUBLIC, NON-VIOLENT, CONSCIENTIOUS BREACH OF LAW PERFORMED WITH OVERALL FIDELITY TO LAW AND A WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT PUNISHMENT. IT REJECTS THE NARROW RAWLSIAN NOTION IN FAVOUR OF A BROADER NOTION OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE UNDERSTOOD AS A CONSTRAINED, CONSCIENTIOUS AND COMMUNICATIVE BREACH OF LAW THAT DEMONSTRATES OPPOSITION TO LAW OR POLICY AND A DESIRE FOR LASTING CHANGE. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT, ACCORDING TO RAWLS' UNDULY NARROW CONCEPTION, EDWARD SNOWDEN IS NOT A CIVIL DISOBEDIENT. BUT, ACCORDING TO THE MORE PLAUSIBLE, BROADER CONCEPTION, HE IS. IT THEN IDENTIFIES SOME ADVANTAGES OF THE BROADER CONCEPTION IN CONTEMPORARY ANALYSES OF NEW FORMS OF DISOBEDIENCE, INCLUDING GLOBALIZED DISOBEDIENCE AND DIGITAL DISOBEDIENCE.
609	WHY ARE SOME COUNTRIES GOVERNED MUCH MORE POORLY THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT JUDGING BY THEIR DEGREE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT? IN PARTICULAR, WHY ARE MOST COUNTRIES OF POST-SOVIET EURASIA, ACCORDING TO NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL EVALUATIONS OF QUALITY OF STATE GOVERNANCE, SIMILAR TO UNDERDEVELOPED THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND LAGGING BEHIND THEIR POST-COMMUNIST COUNTERPARTS IN EASTERN EUROPE? IN SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, V.GEL'MAN REFERS TO THE ANALYSIS OF FACTORS AND MECHANISMS THAT EXPLAIN THE FORMATION OF "BAD GOVERNANCE" IN POST-SOVIET EURASIA. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES SUCH EXPLANATIONS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT AS "LEGACY OF THE PAST", DYNAMICS OF REGIME CHANGES AND INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS POSSIBLE WAYS AND MEANS TO OVERCOME "BAD GOVERNANCE" AND PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH OF THIS PHENOMENON.
610	THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF RUSSIAN LEGISLATION ON THE NOTARY ACTIVITY OF SHARIC A COURTS WITH REGARD TO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING LANDED PROPERTY. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS AS TO THE 'TRADITION' OF MUSLIMS' LAND RIGHTS CAUSED A SUBSTANTIAL LOOPHOLE IN THE APPLICATION OF COLONIAL SUBSTANTIVE LAWS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE RUSSIAN STATE ATTEMPTED TO RETAIN LAND OWNERSHIP FOR ITSELF BY INTRODUCING REGULATIONS THAT FORMALLY RESTRICTED MUSLIMS' LAND RIGHTS TO POSSESSION AND USUFRUCT; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION NEVER ESTABLISHED REGULATIONS THAT ENSURED THAT THESE LAWS WOULD BE ENFORCED BY SHARIC A COURTS AND FAILED TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE APPLICATION OF ISLAMIC LAW. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT HOW THE COLONIAL DEFINITION OF MUSLIMS' LAND RIGHTS WAS LARGELY DISREGARDED WHEN THE MUSLIM JUDICIARY NOTARIZED TRANSACTIONS ON LAND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIC A. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COLONIAL LEGISLATION WITH REGARD TO LAND IN TURKESTAN STEMMED FROM THE FAILURE TO REFORM ISLAMIC PROCEDURAL LAW, A PROCESS THAT WOULD HAVE ENTAILED CODIFYING IT.
611	IF POPULISTS CAPTURE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS WILL CHANGE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DOES NOT ACT AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE RULING MAJORITY BUT RATHER AS A TOOL FOR THE RULING MAJORITY ITSELF TO ADVANCE ITS INTERESTS. THIS ARTICLE UNPACKS THIS ASPECT OF POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH I REFERRED TO AS THE INSTRUMENTAL ABUSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT PRESENTS AND ANALYSES FIVE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES BY WHICH POPULISTS CAN ABUSE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS AN INSTRUMENT AGAINST OPPOSITION. THESE TECHNIQUES ARE THE 'GOVERNING, DO NOT DISTURB' TECHNIQUE, CONSISTING IN NOT QUASHING UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS; THE LEGITIMATION TECHNIQUE, THROUGH WHICH POPULISTS JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS; THE DELEGATION TECHNIQUE, THROUGH WHICH POPULISTS SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY FOR POTENTIALLY UNPOPULAR ACTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT; THE OUTRIGHT COUNTER-OPPOSITION TECHNIQUE, THROUGH WHICH POPULISTS CAN ACHIEVE THE LIQUIDATION OF THEIR OPPONENTS; AND THE EXTRA-LEGAL TECHNIQUE, INVOLVING THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY OF JUDGES IN THE MEDIA.
612	AMERICAN LIBERALISM EMERGED BEFORE THE MOST FAMOUS EUROPEAN LIBERAL INTELLECTUALS PUT THEIR PENS TO PAPER. IT WAS GROUNDED PARTLY ON LIBERAL IDEAS THAT WERE IN THE AIR BEFORE THOSE WORKS WERE WRITTEN, BUT MOSTLY ON THE ATTRACTIVE COMMUNITIES GENERATED BY LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES. AMERICAN LIBERALISM IS EMPIRICALLY, RATHER THAN THEORETICALLY, GROUNDED. THIS PAPER USES EXCERPTS FROM COLONIAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DOCUMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE LONG HISTORY OF LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE TERRITORIES THAT BECAME THE UNITED STATES. AMERICAN LIBERALISM IS AN EVOLUTIONARY RATHER THAN AN INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON.
613	THE PRESENT WORK DISCUSSES WHICH LAW NATURE OF THE RULES MADE BY INDEPENDENT REGULATORY COMMISSION. THESE AUTHORITIES ARE PARTICULARLY INHERENT TO THE REGULATORY STATE, WHO HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE RULES OF LAW REGIME. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISCUSS WHAT LAW NATURE OF THESE RULES AND THE LAW REGIME TO BE FOLLOWED. THUS, WE START THE EXPLANATION OF STATE FUNCTIONS AND ITS EVOLUTION, FROM ITS DESIGN TO THE PRESENT DAY, IN WHICH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION DEMANDED AN OVERHAUL, ALTHOUGH MANY STILL REMAIN "STUCK" TO THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY. AT THE END, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE RULES DEVELOPED BY THE INDEPENDENT REGULATORY COMMISSION HAVE LAW NATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACT, SPECIFICALLY REGULATION EXECUTIVE (OR AUTHORIZED REGULATION), RESULTING FROM A SECONDARY DELEGATION, FROM THE INSTITUTE OF DELEGALIZATION.
614	SINCE THE INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL, AND BEHAVIOURAL CONTEXTS AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING POWER DISTRIBUTIONS ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT IN POOR COUNTRIES, AS SPELLED OUT IN THIS PAPER, THE LAW AND ECONOMICS LITERATURE AS DEVELOPED IN RICH COUNTRIES NEEDS TO BE SERIOUSLY MODIFIED IF IT IS TO BE OF RELEVANCE TO FORMER COUNTRIES.

615	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HIT NEPAL HARDER IN 2021 THAN IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, RESULTING IN THOUSANDS DEAD, MILLIONS OF LIVELIHOODS LOST, FOOD ACCESS CONSTRICTED, EDUCATIONS UPENDED, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVASTATION. IN THE MIDST OF THIS, POLITICAL LEADERS WERE PREOCCUPIED WITH POWER POLITICS, LEAVING THE COUNTRY ILL-EQUIPPED TO MANAGE THE COVID-19 CRISIS. FRAGILE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND NORMS WERE UNDERMINED BY THE INABILITY OF LEADERS TO PRIORITIZE GOVERNANCE. ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND CONTINUED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS FURTHER EXACERBATED THE COUNTRY'S WOES.
616	DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR, STATELESSNESS ERUPTED SUDDENLY - AN ANOMALY AT A TIME WHEN NATIONS WERE FIGHTING EACH OTHER AT GUNPOINT. THE STATELESS OF GERMAN ORIGIN IN BELGIUM DISCOVERED THEIR LEGAL STATUS TO BE A RESOURCE TO OPPOSE CLAIMS ON THEM BY THE GERMAN (AND BELGIAN) STATE. AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR, THE BELGIAN STATE TOOK REVENGE ON THE GERMANS IN THEIR MIDST BY CONFISCATING THEIR PRIVATE PROPERTY. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHETHER THE PROPERTY OF THE STATELESS OF GERMAN ORIGIN WAS CONSIDERED AS ENEMY PROPERTY. ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL LAW OPPOSED SUCH A POSITION, BELGIAN NATIONALISTS INSISTED ON PUNISHING ALL GERMANS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEGAL STATUS.
617	NORTHERN MACEDONIA IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF INSTABILITY WITHIN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA DUE TO THE WELL-KNOWN GEOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE ALBANIAN MINORITY AND THE DENOMINATION, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEEN OVERCOME. HOWEVER, A SEMI-PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT EMERGES THAT IS NOT DISSIMILAR FROM OTHER CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHICH, TRANSCENDING THE CLASSIC DUVERGER MODEL, IS CHARACTERIZED BY A PREDOMINANCE OF PARLIAMENTARY CENTRALITY OPPOSED TO THE HEAD OF STATE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS. ONLY A PRESIDENT WITH A STRONG PERSONALITY APPEARS TO BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT ACTION, THROUGH HIS POWER AS A MAGISTRATE OF INFLUENCE AND PERSUASION. OTHERWISE, THE NATIONALIST GRUEVSKI'S PRIME MINISTER DECADE WAS CHARACTERIZED BY AUTHORITARIANISM WITH A HYBRID REGIME OR AN ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THUS, THE POLITICAL, INSTITUTIONAL, HISTORICAL AND INTERETHNIC CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY DID NOT, THEREFORE, FAVOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE SEMI-PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM TOWARDS A "STRONG PRESIDENT" MODEL.
618	THIS PAPER AIMS TO FILL THE VOID IN THE LITERATURE BY ANSWERING THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTION: TO WHAT EXTENT HAS THE CHINESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONALIZED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FOR ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE OF AGENT CONTROL OF LOCAL LAND USE IN CHINA? FOCUSING ON THE STATED PURPOSES, SPECIFIED ACTORS, AND INSTALLED MECHANISMS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, AN INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE NATIONAL LAND USE REGULATIONS AND POLICIES ENACTED BETWEEN 1947 AND 2012. IT WAS FOUND, WITHOUT INSTITUTIONALIZED INPUT AND SURVEILLANCE FROM BOTTOM-UP BY INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS), THE TOP-DOWN APPROACHES REMAINED INEFFECTIVE AND,LAND USE WAS MAINLY LEFT FOR MANIPULATION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE RURAL-URBAN DICHOTOMY AND LACK OF INSTITUTIONALIZED PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN LAND USE DECISION-MAKING HAVE COMPROMISED EQUAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERS, ERODED PUBLIC TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND LED TO SOCIAL UNREST. THUS, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS NOT ONLY TO DIRECTLY CONTROL THE DISCHARGE OF DISCRETIONARY POWER BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, BUT ALSO TO EMPOWER THE PUBLIC FOR HOLDING THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR LAND USE DECISIONS.

619	OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY CONSIDERED THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE EFFEC-TIVEMESS OF LOCKDOWN MEASURES DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. EARLIER STUDIES FOCUSING ON CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FOUND AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LOW CASE NUMBERS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CULTURAL TIGHTNESS. MEANWHILE, INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH AND INCOME LEVELS REVEALED A PUZZLING NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES AND DEATHS. METHODS: DATA AVAILABLE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2021 WERE USED TO ANALYSE THE DYNAMIC IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCKDOWNS. THE CROSS-SECTIONAL DIMENSION OF COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA WAS COMBINED WITH THE TIME-SERIES DIMENSION OF PANDEMIC-RELATED MEASURES, USING ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES DEALING WITH PANEL DATA. FINDINGS: GREATER STRINGENCY OF LOCKDOWN MEASURES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER CASES. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH ENHANCED THIS NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP. COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEFINED AND ESTABLISHED LAWS PERFORMED BETTER FOR A GIVEN SET OF LOCKDOWN MEASURES COMPARED WITH COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER INSTITUTIONAL STRUC-TURES. CULTURAL TIGHTNESS REDUCED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LOCKDOWNS, IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS FINDINGS AT CROSS-SECTIONAL LEVEL. CONCLUSION: INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTH PLAYS A GREATER ROLE THAN CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF LOCKDOWNS. THESE RESULTS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONS FOR PANDEMIC CONTROL. (C) 2021 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES.
620	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES COLOMBIAN SPORT POLICY FROM THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE PRESENT. THE TEXT EVALUATES HOW POLICIES WERE CONNECTED TO THE EBBS AND FLOWS OF COLOMBIAN POLITICS AND THE CLIENTELIST STRUCTURES THAT CHARACTERISE THE COUNTRY'S PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. IT SHOWS THE WAY IN WHICH SPORT POLICY WAS CHALLENGED, TRANSFORMED, AND OVERSEEN BY CIVIL SERVANTS AND GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES SOME INSIGHT INTO THE INFLUENCE THAT INDIVIDUALS SUCH AS ATHLETES, COACHES, AND SPORTS ENTREPRENEURS HAD ON THE EVOLUTION AND RATIONALITY OF THE POLICIES ENACTED AFTER 1925. IT SHOWS HOW ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MOTIVES RESTRICTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOME OF THESE POLICIES AMONGST WOMEN, AFRO COLOMBIANS, AND INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT BOTH THE STATE AND SOME SECTORS OF CIVIL SOCIETY, INTERESTED IN PROMOTING ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES AS A SYMBOL OF PROGRESS AND MODERNITY, HAVE BEEN EQUALLY INFLUENTIAL IN THE ORGANISATIONAL MODEL OF COLOMBIAN SPORT.
621	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES IN MALAWI. IT EXPLORES THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND FINDS THAT THE SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY MALAWI'S CONSTITUTION HAS MANIFEST WEAKNESSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPOSITION OF THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSION (JSC) IS NARROW AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF MALAWIAN SOCIETY; THERE ARE ALSO NO PROCEDURES FOR THE JSC TO FOLLOW IN ITS OPERATIONS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE SYSTEM FOR APPOINTING JUDGES HAS A BEARING ON THE EVENTUAL CHARACTER AND INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIARY ITSELF, HENCE IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALIGN IT WITH THE CONSTITUTION'S IDEALS. IN CONCLUSION, THE ARTICLE MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING BY BROADENING THE JSC'S COMPOSITION, ADOPTING A LAW TO STIPULATE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT PROCEDURES FOR THE JSC AND ALSO CURBING PRESIDENTIAL POWERS IN RELATION TO JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS.
622	THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS IT RELATES TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AND FOCUSES ON HOW INSTITUTIONS AFFECT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF RESERVATION AND RESERVE ECONOMIES. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS TO RESERVATION AND RESERVE LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, WHETHER COMMUNAL OR INDIVIDUAL, ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF PRODUCTIVITY. POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS STABLE AND PREDICTABLE TO TRIBAL MEMBERS AND TO NON-NATIVES ALSO IMPROVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LIVING ON RESERVATIONS AND RESERVES. RESEARCH REVIEWED HERE ALSO SHOWS THAT CULTURE AND ACCULTURATION ARE IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. ALTHOUGH OUR EMPHASIS IS ON NORTH AMERICA, THE FINDINGS ARE APPLICABLE TO INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND SHED LIGHT ON GROWTH QUESTIONS THAT LOOM LARGE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.
623	THIS PAPER LIES AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO LARGER PROJECTS, ONE ON KANT'S LEGAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE OTHER ON THE RELATION BETWEEN PRIVATE LAW AND DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE. IT USES THE KANTIAN IDEA OF PRIVATE ORDERING TO EXPLAIN THE PLACE OF PRIVATE LAW IN WHAT JOHN RAWLS HAS DESCRIBED AS THE "DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITY" BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL. I EXPLAIN WHY PRIVATE LAW IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHAT, FOR RAWLS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL SUBJECT OF JUSTICE - THE COERCIVE STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY. I ARGUE THAT PRIVATE LAW IS ONLY A SYSTEM OF RECIPROCAL LIMITS ON FREEDOM, PROVIDED THAT THOSE LIMITS ARE GENERAL IN THE RIGHT WAY. I ALSO ARGUE THAT THE BEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT RAWLS'S EMPHASIS IN PUBLIC PROVISION OF ADEQUATE RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES IS IN PARALLEL TERMS: THEY ARE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS TO THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MORAL PREREQUISITES FOR A SHARE PUBLIC SPHERE.
624	THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW CORRUPTION, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND TERRORIST FINANCING COULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH AN ANTICORRUPTION PROTOCOL TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION (APUNCAC). APUNCAC SEEKS TO ESTABLISH UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS, DEDICATED ANTICORRUPTION COURTS, AND AGGRESSIVE MEASURES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN AND REPORT ACCURATE BENEFICIAL OWNER INFORMATIONWHEN FUNDS ARE TRANSMITTED INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO DETER MONEY LAUNDERING. APUNCAC WOULD ALLOW PRIVATE LITIGANTS TO COMMENCE A RACKETEER INFLUENCED AND CORRUPT ORGANIZATIONS (RICO) CIVIL ACTION AND RECOVER THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THEIR DAMAGES. THESE PROVISIONS CREATE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE LITIGANTS TO FIGHT CORRUPTION THROUGH CIVIL ACTIONS. THE PROVISIONS LEVERAGE PRIVATE INTERESTS AND ALIGN THESE INTERESTS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. APUNCAC ALSO INCLUDES TREATY PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT APUNCAC IS IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF COMPLEMENTARITY. APUNCAC IS DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT, RATHER THAN REPLACE, EXISTING DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS.
625	REGARDLESS OF CONSIDERING DECISION MAKING A WORK OF THE DEVIL, SUPPORT FOR THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT EXPRESSES JINGER, SCHMITT AND HEIDEGGER'S ABSOLUTE REJECTION OF THE PREVAILING SYSTEM, AND THE DESIRE TO AVOID THE CATASTROPHIC SITUATION INTO WHICH GERMANY COULD LEAD. TO ENDOW THE RULER WITH EXCEPTIONAL POWER HAS TWO OBJECTIVES: THE IMMEDIATE, TO PUT AN END TO A CORRUPT REGIME THAT WAS DESTROYING THE VOLKGEIST. THE OTHER WAS TO ADAPT THE SITUATION TO A PROFOUND REFORM THAT WOULD HALT THE PROCESS OF DECADENCE, IDEA THAT HAD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND THAT WAS CREATING A NIHILISTIC MENTALITY IN PART OF THE SOCIETY. GERMANY HAD COME BEFORE OTHER COUNTRIES TO THE PROCESS IN WHICH THE BOURGEOIS MENTALITY, WHICH SOUGHT SECURITY AND DISREGARDED THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT, AND THE COLLECTIVIST MENTALITY CONVERGED, WHICH DEFENDED THE INTERNATIONALIZATION AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE GERMAN NATION, AS A DETERMINED NEED TO COMPOSE HUMANITY. JINGER, SCHMITT AND HEIDEGGER WILL REJECT BOTH VERSIONS. SCHMITT WILL BE THE MOST REALISTIC. HIS POLITICAL CONCEPTS ARE GOING TO TAKE ON A DIMENSION THAT WILL TRANSCEND ITS TIME. THE THREE OF THEM WILL WANT TO PUT AN END TO THE FALSEHOOD THAT DOMINATED THE POLITICAL, MORAL AND LEGAL SUPERSTRUCTURE, AND THAT PREVENTED A MINIMAL AUTHENTICITY OF THE DASEIN. THAT IS WHY THEY EXPECTED THE RULER TO TEMPORARILY UNITE THE POTESTAS WITH THE DECISION-MAKING POWER OF THE AUCTORITAS, IN ORDER TO RECOVER THE LOST ORDER. WOULDN'T THE SAME POLITICAL CATEGORIES APPEAR WITH DIFFERENT CONTEXTS? COULD IT BE THAT DISORDER SITUATIONS WILL ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY A TEMPORARILY DECISIONIST RULER?
626	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE ONE OF THE MOST WIDESPREAD CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES DEVELOPED BY ROBERT ALEXY'S THEORY OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE MAXIM OF PROPORTIONALITY, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO WEIGHTING AS A METHOD AIMED AT RESOLVING CONFLICTING ANTINOMIES BETWEEN PRINCIPLES - OPTIMIZATION COMMANDMENTS THAT DETERMINE THAT SOMETHING IS CARRIED OUT TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, ACCORDING TO THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL POSSIBILITIES. IT SEEKS, THEREFORE, TO QUESTION WHETHER THE TREATMENT OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES CARRIED OUT BY THE GERMAN MASTER, ACCORDING TO THE PREMISES HE RAISED IN HIS THEORY, COULD ERECT OBSTACLES TO THE CONTROL OF THE LEGALITY AND CONSTITUTIONALITY OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE ENTRY OF THE JUDGE'S PRACTICAL REASONING IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE JUDICIAL DECISION. THE FOCUS OF THIS WORK IS THE DISCUSSION ON JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN WEIGHING CONFLICTING PRINCIPLES, IN ORDER TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THE SUPPOSED RATIONALITY OF THE METHOD PROPOSED BY THE THEORY OF LEGAL ARGUMENTATION, QUESTIONING THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY OF ITS USE IN THE SOLUTION OF CASES PRESENTED TO THE JUDICIARY.
627	THE ARTICLE'S RELEVANCE IS BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICE IS A RELATIVELY NEW INSTITUTION, THE CREATION OF WHICH WAS COMPLETED LAST YEAR. HOWEVER, ANALOGS OF SUCH A SERVICE OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES (IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED STATES, CANADA). EFFECTIVE MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER DURING THE COURT HEARING IS ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE REFORM PROCESSES OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE, WHICH MUST DIRECTLY MEET EUROPEAN STANDARDS. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE ISSUE OF RESEARCH OF THIS INSTITUTION IN UKRAINE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES IN THE FUNCTIONING OF ITS COUNTERPARTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IS RELEVANT. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICE AND ITS ANALOGS IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE OBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT ARISE IN THE FIELD OF SECURITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE PRINCIPLES OF FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICE AND ITS ANALOGS. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY IS A SET OF GENERAL AND UNIQUE METHODS OF COGNITION, IN PARTICULAR: DIALECTICAL, HISTORICAL, DESCRIPTIVE, METHODOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS, AND GENERALIZATION-COMPARATIVE LAW, STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONAL AND ANALYTICAL. ANALYZING THE EXPERIENCE OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN ORGANIZING THE ACTIVITIES OF SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICE, IT WAS EMPHASIZED THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST OF JUDGES IN SUCH JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICES AND THE CLOSE COOPERATION OF THE LATTER WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT THE FORMATION AND OPERATION OF INSTITUTIONS AS THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION SERVICE DIRECTLY DEPEND ON FINANCIAL SUPPORT, ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES, AND PERSONNEL POLICY.
628	IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS, ADMINISTRATIVE ETHICAL PRACTICES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR DETERMINING THE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND A CRUCIAL ELEMENT TO BE INCORPORATED IN BUILDING CITIZEN TRUST. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ASSESS HOW UNETHICAL ACTIONS AFFECT THE GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING CITIZENS' TRUST. FIELD SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY SENDING QUESTIONNAIRES TO 1000 PAKISTANI CITIZENS WHO WERE ABOVE THE AGE OF 20, HAVING MINIMUM EDUCATION OF HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. THE RESPONSE RATE WAS 53.3%. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND CITIZEN TRUST AND A NEGATIVE MODERATING EFFECT OF UNETHICAL ACTIONS. THE FINDINGS MAY BE PRACTICALLY USEFUL FOR BOTH RESEARCH AND POLICY MAKING, SINCE IT INVESTIGATED THE CITIZENS' PERSPECTIVE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, CITIZEN TRUST AND UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. THE FINDINGS EMPHASIZE ADDRESSING THE ETHICAL MODELING AND RE SHAPING OF THE BEHAVIOR OF PUBLIC SECTOR SPECIFICALLY IN PAKISTAN, HENCE, IT OPENS THE WAY FOR FUTURE STUDIES ON THE REFLECTION OF ETHICS AND CULTURE ON GOOD GOVERNANCE AND CITIZEN TRUST.

629	IN MAY 2020, THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECIDED THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, A DECISION BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOULD OR COULD BE IGNORED BY A NATIONAL COURT, WHICH WOULD HAVE THE LAST WORD TO DECIDE ON THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EU TREATIES OF A MEASURE ADOPTED BY AN EU INSTITUTION OR BODY. THE CONTRIBUTION EXAMINES, WHETHER THIS GERMAN DECISION IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EU TREATIES AND CONCLUDES THAT IT THIS IS NOT THE CASE.
630	POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AND DECAY IS ONE OF THE MOST STUDIED TOPICS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE. THE ISSUE CONTINUES TO OCCUPY MANY POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND IS ALSO HIGHLY EMPIRICALLY RELEVANT - NOT LEAST IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT UPRISINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER DEMOCRACY CAN AND WILL MAKE HEADWAY IN THIS REGION, AS IT HAS BEEN RESISTANT THUS FAR TO THE EMERGENCE OF DEMOCRACY. THESE SOCIETIES ARE DEEPLY 'PATRIMONIALISED'; THAT IS, THE PRACTICE OF PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS STRUCTURES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY. THIS REVIEW ESSAY DISCUSSES TWO RECENT BOOKS THAT CAST NEW LIGHT ON HOW COUNTRIES CAN OVERCOME SUCH FUNDAMENTAL OBSTACLES TO DEMOCRATISATION AS PATRIMONIALISM. MOST RECENTLY, FUKUYAMA HAS OFFERED A COMPREHENSIVE REINTERPRETATION OF HUMAN HISTORY WITH THE ORIGINS OF POLITICAL ORDER, BUT ONE THAT IS BROADLY IN LINE WITH THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING IN NORTH, WALLIS AND WEINGAST'S VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL ORDERS: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERPRETING RECORDED HUMAN HISTORY. HOWEVER, BOTH CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO APPLY TO CONTEMPORARY CASES OF DEMOCRATISATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW ARTICLE IS TO SKETCH A STARTING POINT FOR SUCH A CONTEMPORARY ANALYSIS, WHICH COULD ALSO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE PROSPECTS FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. FUKUYAMA, F.

631	THIS PAPER, BASED ON THE LATEST JUDICIAL DECISIONS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELEVANT LITERATURE COMMENTS, DEALS WITH MUTUAL TRUST PRINCIPLE RELATED TO HRS PROTECTION, ESPECIALLY RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES. THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL TRUST RENOWNED FOR BEING A MILESTONE OF THE EU AREA OF FREEDOM SECURITY AND JUSTICE COMES FROM THE MUTUAL CONFIDENCE IN THE RULE OF LAW AS EUROPEAN INTEGRATION FOUNDATION. MEANWHILE, THE CJEU DECIDED RECENTLY FIVE CASES CONSIDERING POLISH JUDICIARY INDEPENDENCE. THE ANALYSIS OF THESE JUDICIAL DECISIONS GIVES A CLEAR PICTURE OF A MEMBER STATE THAT NEITHER APPLIES EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION PRINCIPLE OF ARTICLE 19 OF THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EU NOR GUARANTEES A RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL UNDER ART. 47 OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EU. THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION OF THIS ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE LIMITS OF MUTUAL TRUST IN REFERENCE TO POLAND. IN CASE C-216/18, PPU/LM COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU FOR THE FIRST TIME DEALT WITH POLISH JUDICIAL SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES THAT UNDERMINED TRUST OF IRISH HIGH COURT EXECUTING POLISH EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW). INSPIRED BY THE STRASBOURG JURISPRUDENCE AND THE POSITIONS OF NATIONAL COURTS THE CJEU ACCEPTED DECENTRALIZED JUDICIAL REVIEW OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN MEMBER STATES. DEVELOPING PREVIOUS JURISPRUDENCE BASED ON CASES: C-411/10 AND C-493/10 N.S AND C-404/15, ARANYOSI/CALDARARU THE COURT OF JUSTICE IN PPU/LM ADOPTED THREE-STAGE TEST AND TAUGHT THE NATIONAL COURTS EXECUTING EAW ABOUT THE STEPS THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN IN CASE OF MISTRUST TO FAIRNESS OF TRIAL IN THE ISSUING STATE. THIS PAPER COMMENTS A FEW OF THE MASTERFUL CJEU DECISIONS BALANCING GENERAL RISK OF MUTUAL TRUST SUSPENSION TOWARDS POLAND WITH ANOTHER GREAT RISK OF RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL DIVERSIFICATION IN MEMBER STATES. ONE COULD SAY - "BETWEEN - SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS". HOWEVER, RECENT JUDGMENTS OF THE CJEU CONSIDERING POLISH COURTS INDEPENDENCE PROVE THAT MUTUAL TRUST CANNOT BE ABSOLUTE, ESPECIALLY IN RESPECT TO FAIR TRIAL. THE FINAL CONCLUSION IS THAT NATIONAL COURTS THAT ARE IN CHARGE OF DILIGENT EXAMINATION OF PROCEDURAL STANDARDS BEYOND THEIR OWN STATES, ON THE ONE HAND, MISTRUST POLISH PROCEDURAL STANDARDS, ON THE OTHER, DO NOT HANDLE EFFICIENT INSTRUMENTS, EXCEPT FOR DIALOGUE, TO SUPERVISE THEIR PEERS FROM ANOTHER MEMBER STATE.
632	SINCE 2006, THAILAND HAS WITNESSED AN UNPRECEDENTED SURGE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO SCRUTINIZE ELECTED POLITICIANS IN THE NAME OF THE RULE OF LAW. DEMOCRACY, ARGUED CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUDGES, COULD ONLY BE CONSOLIDATED IF THE RULE OF LAW WAS MAINTAINED. BUT EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE CONSTITUTIONAL CASES SUGGESTED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WAS ACTUALLY WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE POWERFUL ELITE MINORITY TO OBSTRUCT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS UNDER THE PRETEXT OF PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ANTAGONISTIC POSITION BREWED RESENTMENT AND VIOLENCE WHICH JEOPARDIZED THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S LEGITIMACY AS A NEUTRAL POLITICAL ARBITER. THE 2014 COUP D'ETAT SHOWED THAT ONCE AGAIN THE COUNTRY HAS FAILED TO CONSOLIDATE ITS DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS FAILURE SUGGESTS THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NOTION OF ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY.
633	BUILDING CONSTITUTIONALISM AFTER AUTHORITARIANISM IS A CENTRAL CONCERN OF OUR TIMES. MARTIN KRYGIER'S WORK ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGES OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE STRUGGLE TO ENHANCE CONSTITUTIONALISM IN POST-SOCIALIST SOCIETIES IN PARTICULAR. I SHOW HOW MARTIN'S THEORETICAL CONCERNS WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM AFTER AUTHORITARIANISM MOVE FROM ACADEMIA TO THE WORLD THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF THE AUSTRALIA MYANMAR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY PROJECT. MARTIN'S WORK AFFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND TIME IN FOSTERING AND RENEWING UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE USE OF LAW AND THE LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS.
634	THE MORAL IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IS A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY, EMBODIED IN U.S. LAW IN THE DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES. MANY SCHOLARS, HOWEVER, HAVE WORRIED THAT THE RULE-OF-LAW REQUIREMENT THAT THE LAWS BE GENERAL ORDINARILY INTERPRETED AS A COMMAND OF "FORMAL EQUALITY"-FORBIDS STATES FROM PURSUING GENUINE ("SUBSTANTIVE") EQUALITY, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN GROUPS DIVIDED BY LINES OF SOCIAL HIERARCHY. THEY HAVE SIMILAR WORRIES ABOUT THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. IN THIS ARTICLE, I AIM TO PUT THOSE WORRIES TO REST. FIRST, I SHOW THAT THE FORMAL EQUALITY INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW (AND OF EQUAL PROTECTION) IS LOGICALLY INCOHERENT. THEN, DRAWING ON A NOVEL ACCOUNT OF HOW TO DETERMINE THE EXPRESSIVE MEANING OF A LAW, I SHOW THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE RULE OF LAW AND EQUAL PROTECTION COMPATIBLE WITH EGALITARIAN JUSTICE, BUT THAT THEY POSITIVELY DEMAND AT LEAST A BASIC LEVEL OF EGALITARIAN JUSTICE, IN THE FORM OF THE COMMAND TO ELIMINATE SOCIAL HIERARCHIES EMBEDDED IN THE LAW. FROM THIS, I CONCLUDE THAT THE LEGAL IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW CONTRIBUTES TO, RATHER THAN THREATENS, CRITICAL PROJECTS AIMED AT THE ELIMINATION OF SOCIAL HIERARCHY. POLITICAL RADICALS, ASSOCIATED IN THE LAW WITH, INTER ALIA, MARXISM, FEMINISM, CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES, CRITICAL RACE STUDIES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENTS, HAVE LONG BEEN SKEPTICAL OF THE LEGAL IDEALS TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LIBERALISM. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THEY SHOULD LEARN TO LOVE THE RULE OF LAW.
635	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT AS A CLASS OF LITIGANT, AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS PARTICULAR CLASS OF LITIGANT PRESENTS FOR THE COURT. THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN SOCIETY IS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH, TOGETHER WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE RULE OF LAW DIRECTLY IMPACTS ON THE COURT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT DISCHARGES ITS PRIMARY SOCIETAL FUNCTION. IT IS ADVANCED THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE COURT TO ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES OF INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WAYS IN WHICH THE COURT'S CAPACITY TO DISCHARGE ITS SOCIETAL FUNCTION IS IMPAIRED WHEN IT ENGAGES WITH THE SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT, THUS PREVENTING STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. ULTIMATELY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SELF-REPRESENTED LITIGANT CAN PROPERLY BE VIEWED AS A CHALLENGE TO JUSTICE.
636	DOES THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW? THAT IS A HARD QUESTION, AND IN THIS ARTICLE, I SEEK TO EXPLAIN WHY. PUT SIMPLY, THE QUESTION IS HARD BECAUSE OUR ANSWER WILL DEPEND ON OUR BROADER THEORY OF HOW TO INTERPRET A CONSTITUTION. IF ONE COMMITS TO THE THEORY OF ORIGINALISM, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW. YET IF ONE COMMITS TO OTHER POPULAR AND CREDIBLE THEORIES - SUCH AS PERFECTIONISM OR PRAGMATISM - ONE MAY REASONABLY FORM THE VIEW THAT THE CONSTITUTION DOES SUBSTANTIALLY GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE EARLIER PARTS OF THIS ARTICLE, I ESTABLISH THIS LINK BETWEEN INTERPRETIVE THEORIES AND THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. IN THE LATTER PARTS OF THE ARTICLE, I GO ABOUT DISCREDITING ONE INTERPRETIVE THEORY - ORIGINALISM. HAVING DISCREDITED ORIGINALISM, I CONCLUDE THAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE OTHER INTERPRETIVE THEORIES, SUCH AS PERFECTIONISM AND PRAGMATISM SERIOUSLY. IPSO FACTO, WE MUST TAKE SERIOUSLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE CONSTITUTION, ON ITS BEST INTERPRETATION, DOES GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONCLUSION IS IN TENSION WITH THE WORK OF LISA BURTON-CRAWFORD, TO WHICH THIS ARTICLE IS A RESPONSE.
637	THE ESSAY EXPLAINS WHY AND HOW LATIN AMERICAN SOCIETIES, DURING THE PERIOD OF 1930 TO 1980, ACCEPTED THE DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF POPULIST REGIMES; WHY THESE POLITICAL SYSTEMS PERPETUATED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME; WHAT MECHANISMS WERE EMPLOYED TO MANAGE INTERNAL ORDER; WHY AND HOW THE DESTRUCTION OCCURRED IN THE DECADE OF THE 1980S; WHY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21(ST) CENTURY CERTAIN FORMS OF POPULIST-DEMAGOGIC APPEALS IN THE LATIN- AMERICAN POLITICAL PANORAMA RETURNED TO THE SCENE; WHY THE STATE IN LATIN AMERICA REACHED SUCH LOW LEVELS OF INSTITUTIONALISM HALFWAY THROUGH THE 20(TH) CENTURY; WHY THE DISCOURSE OF MIXED RACES TRANSFORMED ITSELF INTO THE CENTRAL ELEMENT, CAPABLE OF UNITING THE COMPLEX MAGMA FORMED BY STRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY; AND WHY ''OLD NATIONALISMS'' ARE GIVING WAY TO NEW METHODS AND ALTERNATIVE DISCOURSES ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF IDENTITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21(ST) CENTURY.
638	WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A LEGAL SYSTEM'S FOREIGN-FACING ELEMENTS AND ITS DOMESTIC ONES? CONTRARY TO "DUALISTIC" THEORIES ("DUALISM," "LEGAL DUALISM," THE "DUAL STATE," ETC.) WHICH MAY SUGGEST THAT A SINGLE LEGAL SYSTEM MAY ENCOMPASS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT REGIMES REGARDING FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC LEGAL QUESTIONS, THIS ARTICLE TAKES THE VIEW THAT GAPS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN-FACING AND DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF A LEGAL SYSTEM MAY THREATEN THAT SYSTEM'S LEGITIMACY. COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FOREIGN/EXTERNAL AND DOMESTIC/INTERNAL ASPECTS OF A LEGAL SYSTEM COULD BE MEASURED ACROSS A RANGE OF CATEGORIES, INCLUDING PROVISION OF JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, AND EFFICIENCY. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE. AS USED IN THIS ARTICLE, DIFFERENCE MEANS BOTH THE NATURE AND SOURCE OF LAW (E.G., FOREIGN LAW, NON-STATE LAW, RELIGIOUS LAW, CUSTOMARY LAW, ETC.) AND OF LEGAL AUTHORITIES (I.E., IN TERMS OF RACE, ETHNICITY, GENDER, AND NATIONALITY). THE QUESTION POSED IS WHETHER A LEGAL SYSTEM CAN REGARD DIFFERENCE DISPARATELY BETWEEN ITS FOREIGN-FACING AND DOMESTIC ASPECTS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION THROUGH A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) AND THE UNITED STATES, THE TWO MOST POWERFUL ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD AND WHICH ARE LOCKED IN A TRADE-CUM-TECH WAR. THE QUESTION OF THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENCE HAS PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE. HOW WE CHARACTERIZE AND ANALYZE THE PRC LEGAL SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FROM THE VANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES, AS HOW THE PRC DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM MAY SHAPE ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND TRADE PARTNERS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, IN PARTICULAR, IS BOTH GENERALLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND MAY AFFECT U.S. ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICY. MISUNDERSTANDING RESULTS IN A NUMBER OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES ACROSS A RANGE OF IMPORTANT ISSUES, INCLUDING SUBOPTIMAL COMPETITION WITH CHINA ON DEVELOPMENTAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME STATES, AS WELL AS DIFFICULTIES IN U.S.-CHINA COORDINATION ON GLOBAL PROBLEMS (E.G., POVERTY, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND HEALTH), WITH COMPETITION AND COORDINATION NOT BEING MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, THIS ARTICLE IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO ANALYZE CHINA'S "FOREIGN-RELATED 'RULE OF LAW'" (SHEWAI FAZHI) REFORMS AT THE INTERSECTION OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW WHICH PURPORT TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA'S DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM AND NON-DOMESTIC LAW, EXPOSING CHINA TO GREATER DEGREES OF DIFFERENCE. THE ARTICLE IS COMPRISED OF TWO SETS OF COMPARISONS: ONE IS WITHIN AND THE OTHER IS BETWEEN LEGAL SYSTEMS-THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. IT FINDS THAT IN THE U.S. CASE, THERE IS, BROADLY, CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S PRIVILEGING OF U.S. LAW EXTRATERRITORIALLY AND THE STATUS OF FOREIGN LAW DOMESTICALLY. HOWEVER, THE CHINESE CASE IS MARKED BY GROWING DIVERGENCE BETWEEN ITS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL-FACING APPROACHES TO FOREIGN LAW. WHEREAS THE UNITED STATES HAS HISTORICALLY EMBRACED VERSIONS OF LEGAL EXCEPTIONALISM (BOTH EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY), CHINA HAS INTRODUCED REFORMS WHICH ORIENT IT TOWARD A RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL LAW AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES THAT I CALL LEGAL COSMOPOLITANISM, THE SELECTIVE INTEGRATION OF FOREIGN LAWS AND THEIR AUTHORITIES INTO CHINESE LAW AND, CONVERSELY, THE WORLDING OF CHINESE LAW. LEGAL COSMOPOLITANISM IS PREDICATED ON CHINA'S CENTRALITY IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT AND PROMOTED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) AND CHINESE ACADEMICS WHO SEEK TO POSITION THE PRC AS A LEADER OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AS A CORRECTIVE TO U.S. RACIAL CAPITALISM. HOWEVER, CHINA FACES A NUMBER OF OBSTACLES IN BUILDING LEGAL COSMOPOLITANISM, AMONG THOSE, ITS DOMESTIC LAW APPROACHES TOWARD DIFFERENCE MAY BE TRENDING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, WIDENING THE GAP BETWEEN THE FOREIGN-FACING AND INTERNAL ASPECTS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. AS A RESULT, LEGAL COSMOPOLITANISM REMAINS ASPIRATIONAL. INSPIRED BY LEGAL REALISM, DECOLONIZATION THEORY, AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY, AND INFORMED BY A COMPARATIVE OUTLOOK, THE BROAD CLAIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT THE TRAJECTORY OF EXTERNALLY-FACING LEGAL REFORM ENCOUNTERS DIFFICULTY ESCAPING THE CORRESPONDING FEATURES OF DOMESTIC LAW. AS A GENERAL OBSERVATION, DUE TO BOTH DOMESTIC PRESSURES AND EMBEDDEDNESS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, LEGAL SYSTEMS DEVELOP TOWARDS NORMATIVE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THAT SYSTEM'S INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL-FACING RULES AND AUTHORITIES. WHEREAS THE PRC IS PURPORTING TO BUILD A "FOREIGN-RELATED 'RULE OF LAW'" THAT IS ECUMENICAL, PLURI-LEGAL, AND HYPER-DIVERSE, FOR THE MOST PART, ITS DOMESTIC LAW REMAINS STRIKINGLY UNITARY, HOMOGENOUS, AND "STATE -LED." FURTHERMORE, RECENT STRAINS OF NATIONALISM, PROTECTIONISM, AND EVEN XENOPHOBIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, BUT ESPECIALLY IN CHINA, HAVE FURTHER CLOSED OFF THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. THIS PARADOXICAL STATE OF AFFAIRS OF SIMULTANEOUS OPENING AND CLOSURE HAS REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA'S GOAL OF BECOMING A LEADER OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHICH ENTAILS BUILDING GLOBAL LAW. FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, POLICY-MAKERS NEED TO GRASP THIS PICTURE FOR NOT ONLY IMPROVING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA BUT ALSO WITH THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
639	IN SOUTH AFRICA, MUNICIPAL NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LEGISLATION PROMOTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SUFFICIENT WATER IS BOTH A FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A BETRAYAL OF THAT RIGHT. JUDICIAL INTERVENTION HAS PROMPTED FORMALISTIC COMPLIANCE WITH WATER LAW, BUT THE UNDERLYING COMMITMENT TO SUFFICIENT WATER REMAINS UNFULFILLED. DOES THE INABILITY OF COURTS TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL JUSTICE DESPITE ENFORCING SOCIAL LEGISLATION CONFIRM THE THESIS THAT COMMITMENTS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO SOCIAL JUSTICE ARE INCONSISTENT, THAT UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW MAY NOT ADVANCE SOCIAL JUSTICE? THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS INCONSISTENCY THESIS, ARGUING THAT THE RULE OF LAW CAN ACCOMMODATE SOCIAL JUSTICE IF IT DEMANDS NORMATIVE CONGRUENCE ALONGSIDE CONGRUENCE WITH FORMAL RULES. EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES AND THE MULTIFARIOUS NORMATIVE DEMANDS ON OFFICIALS CREATE A CONDITION OF NORMATIVE INCONGRUENCE THAT IMPEDES THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, EVEN AS COURTS COMPEL CONGRUENCE WITH FORMAL RULES.
640	TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE ETA ANNOUNCED ITS DISSOLUTION. SINCE THEN, A GOOD PART OF SPANISH SOCIETY HAS ESTABLISHED THE IDEA THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS INFRINGED A "DEFEAT" ON THE CRIMINAL GANG. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE RESULTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ACTION THROUGH THE STUDY OF LEGISLATION AND SOME SPECIFIC ELOQUENT CASES RESOLVED BY THE COURTS TO REVALIDATE OR REJECT, IF POSSIBLE, THE THEORY OF DEFEAT. IN ADDITION, IN THE CRIMES OF TERRORISM, THE RESPONSE OF THE RULE OF LAW TO VICTIMS THROUGH CORRECTIVE OR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MECHANISMS IS TRANSCENDENTAL, ON WHICH QUALITY IS ALSO A BRIEF REVIEW.
641	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTORS TO BECOME MORE ENGAGED IN ITS PURSUIT OF PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR MASS, SUSTAINABLE MECHANISMS, WHICH INCREASE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE. IT DOES SO BY DEMONSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATING FINANCE AS THE KEY HINDRANCE TO INDIVIDUALS' ACCESSING JUSTICE. FINALLY, IT SETS OUT TWO EMERGING AREAS THAT WOULD BE WORTHY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND SUPPORT BY THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY BUT WHICH HAVE AT PRESENT RECEIVED SCANT TO NO ATTENTION BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF 'RULE OF LAW' OR 'JUSTICE REFORM' EFFORTS.
642	THERE IS AN UNDENIABLE CONNECTION BETWEEN ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THE EMERGING CONCEPT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. ATTEMPTS TO RESTRICT STANDING OF COMMUNITY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS TO CHALLENGE EXERCISES OF EXECUTIVE POWER AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENT DUE TO SO-CALLED 'ENVIRONMENTAL LAWFARE', AND THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER BARRIERS, UNDERMINE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, AND THEREFORE, HAVE A REAL TENDENCY TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. AT A TIME WHEN TRUST IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IS IN DECLINE IN AUSTRALIA, ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT ACCESS TO JUSTICE WARRANT CLOSE EXAMINATION AS TO THEIR JUSTIFICATION AND EFFICACY.
643	HOW ARE GLOBAL NORMS TRANSLATED INTO LOCAL CONTEXTS? I EXAMINE THE TRANSLATION OF THREE RULE-OF-LAW NORMS IN POSTCONFLICT GUATEMALA: THE UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD, THE RIGHT TO ACCESS PUBLIC INFORMATION, AND BEST PRACTICES FOR INTERNATIONAL RULE-OF-LAW COMMISSIONS. THESE CASES, I ARGUE, DO NOT FIT ESTABLISHED MODELS FOR DIFFUSION, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH STANDARD BARGAINING APPROACHES, NORM SOCIALIZATION FRAMEWORKS, AND NORM LOCALIZATION THEORY. INSTEAD, RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION TRIGGERED DOMESTIC CONTESTATION AND, SUBSEQUENTLY, WHAT I TERM AN "INTERACTIVE TRANSLATION LOOP." THESE PROCESSES CHANGED THE MODES OF INTERACTION AMONG RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTERS AND HOW THE NORMS ULTIMATELY TRANSLATED INTO THE GUATEMALAN CONTEXT. I DEMONSTRATE THAT A CRITICAL VARIABLE, THE PRECISION OF INTERNATIONAL NORMS, CONDITIONS THE LEEWAY AVAILABLE FOR SUCH TRANSLATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT MY FRAMEWORK TRAVELS TO OTHER CASES, IT OFFERS AN IMPORTANT CORRECTIVE TO ESTABLISHED THEORIES OF HOW GLOBAL NORMS TRANSLATE INTO LOCAL CONTEXTS.
644	SEVERAL RESEARCHES HAVE SHOWN THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO LIFE SATISFACTION. ONLY A FEW STUDIES, HOWEVER, HAVE EXAMINED WHICH ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM (SMALL GOVERNMENT SIZE, QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, SOUND MONEY, TRADE OPENNESS OR NO REGULATION) DRIVE THIS RELATIONSHIP. FURTHERMORE, MOST STUDIES CONSTRUE THE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AS ADDITIONAL TO THE INFLUENCE OF INCOME PER CAPITA ON LIFE SATISFACTION. NO RESEARCH HAS STUDIED THE POTENTIAL MEDIATING ROLE OF INCOME PER CAPITA OR OTHER MEDIATORS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND LIFE SATISFACTION. IN ORDER TO FILL THESE GAPS, THIS PAPER AIMS (1) TO INVESTIGATE WHICH ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM ARE MOST RELATED TO LIFE SATISFACTION, AND (2) TO TEST WHETHER THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE MEDIATED BY INCOME AND TRUST. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 120 COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT LIFE SATISFACTION IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND NEGATIVELY RELATED TO SMALL GOVERNMENT SIZE. INCOME PER CAPITA MEDIATES THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF THE QUALITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM ON LIFE SATISFACTION. TRUST IS FOUND TO MEDIATE THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF THE QUALITY OF LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF SMALL GOVERNMENT SIZE ON LIFE SATISFACTION, BUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE INDIRECT EFFECTS DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDICATORS USED. WE FIND NO SIGNIFICANT DIRECT EFFECTS FROM THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDICATORS ON LIFE SATISFACTION.
645	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ISSUE OF MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIA. FORMATION OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF RUSSIA'S MODERNIZATION STRATEGY. THE RELEVANCE AND OBJECTIVE NEED TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SPHERE OF LIFE IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY IS DETERMINED BY THE INEFFICIENCY OF EXISTING POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, OUTDATED PRINCIPLES, METHODS, TECHNOLOGIES OF ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT, THEIR INCONSISTENCY WITH MODERN REALITIES, EFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND GLOBAL EXTERNAL CHALLENGES. THE OBJECTIVE MEANING OF MODERNIZATION IS DETERMINED BY MODERN RUSSIAN CONDITIONS, THE NATURE OF ISSUES AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT REQUIRE THEIR URGENT SOLUTION. THE STUDY PURPOSE IS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR THE INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS GOAL REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF THE BASIC CONDITIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS AND PRIORITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ITS MODERNIZATION. AS A METHODOLOGICAL BASE FOR THE STUDY, THE WORK INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES AND METHODS: SYSTEMIC, STRUCTURAL-FUNCTIONAL APPROACHES, SOCIOLOGICAL, LOGICAL, HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE METHODS, AS WELL AS ANALYSIS OF CONDITIONS AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL LIFE OF MODERN RUSSIA. AS A RESEARCH RESULT, WE CAME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS: 1. MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS AN OBJECTIVELY NECESSARY PROCESS. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE RESULT OF CONSENSUS, BUT A COMPETITION BETWEEN INNOVATORS, CONSERVATIVES AND OBSERVERS. 2. THE STRATEGIC GOAL OF MODERNIZING THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY IS TO MAKE RUSSIA ONE OF THE LEADING SOVEREIGN POWERS, WITH A REPUBLICAN DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT, IN WHICH A PERSON LIVES FREELY AND COMFORTABLY. 3. MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM SHALL COVER THE INSTITUTIONAL (STATE, PARTIES), COMMUNICATIVE, REGULATORY AND SPIRITUAL AND IDEOLOGICAL SUBSYSTEMS OF RUSSIA. 4. THE RESULT OF DEMOCRATIC MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM SHALL BE THE FORMATION OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS THAT REALLY REFLECT AND EXPRESS THE INTERESTS OF SOCIAL GROUPS AND STRATA AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMATION OF SOLIDARY COMMUNITY. 5. CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF IDEAS AND VALUES UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, AND CAPABLE OF UNITING VARIOUS LAYERS AND GROUPS TO CARRY OUT MODERNIZATION. 6. AS A RESULT OF MODERNIZATION OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AS A SYSTEM OF DETERMINING GOALS AND PRIORITIES, THE INNOVATIVE MECHANISM BECOMES AN INHERENT ATTRIBUTE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY. THIS IS THE STRATEGIC GOAL OF MODERNIZATION IN RUSSIA.
646	CHINA'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND TRADE EXPANSION SINCE THE 1980S IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS, WHICH LIFTED MORE POPULATIONS OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY THAN ANY OTHER TIME AND PLACE IN HISTORY. THIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY TRADE-LED DEVELOPMENT POLICIES SUCCESSFULLY ADOPTED BY CHINA. CHINA ALSO JOINED THE WTO IN 2001, AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH ITS TRADE PARTNERS, AND IS SUBJECT TO WTO LEGAL DISCIPLINES REQUIRING THE TRANSPARENCY OF ITS TRADE-RELATED DECISIONS AND PROCEDURES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CHINA'S ECONOMIC REFORM, WHICH LED TO ITS ACCESSION INTO THE WTO, AND REVIEWS CHINA'S TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES UNDER THE WTO. IN ADDITION, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES CHINA'S PARTICIPATION IN THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE. THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERN AS TO WHETHER CHINA WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING (DSU). THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT CHINA HAS BECOME AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT AND HAS MAINTAINED WELL UNDER THE TERMS OF THE DSU.
647	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS RACIAL SEGREGATION IN `ALIEN WARDS' ACROSS NORTH QUEENSLAND BETWEEN FEDERATION AND THE 1950S. COLOURED PATIENTS WERE PUT IN THESE WARDS EVEN IF THEY WERE BRITISH SUBJECTS AND NOT `ALIENS' UNDER THE LAW. IN CONTRAST, WHITE PATIENTS WHO WERE LEGALLY ALIENS WERE PLACED IN NORMAL WARDS. AS WELL AS HOSPITALS IN THE NORTH, `CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS' SUCH AS THE LARGE DUNWICH BENEVOLENT ASYLUM ON STRADBROKE ISLAND ALSO HAD AN `ALIEN WARD'. THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT FUNDED RACIAL SEGREGATION IN `ALIEN WARDS 'AND ENDORSED LESS FAVOURABLE TREATMENT FOR THEIR OCCUPANTS, NOT LEAST DURING A BUBONIC PLAGUE OUTBREAK IN 1921.
648	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A LEGAL ANALYSIS SUPPORTING THE RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN HUMAN RIGHT TO ISRAELI CITIZENSHIP FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF EQUALITY IN ISRAEL-PALESTINE. IT DOES SO BY ASSESSING THE WORKINGS OF ISRAELI CITIZENSHIP IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OF THE NATION-STATE AND SETTLER COLONIALISM AND IN LIGHT OF THE ONE-STATE REALITY. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATING THE TWO FRAMEWORKS AS COMPLEMENTARY, RATHER THAN MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, IN ANALYSES INVOLVING PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE STRUGGLE FOR PALESTINIAN EQUALITY IS NOT ONLY A LEGAL ONE BUT ALSO A MORAL ONE, THE SUCCESS OF WHICH DEPENDS UPON A NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONING OF LAW IN SETTLER COLONIALISM.
649	THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC HAS TRIGGERED AN EMERGENCY WITHOUT PRECEDENT TO WHICH THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM HAS ATTEMPTED TO RESPOND BY RESORTING TO EXTRA-ORDINEM REGULATIONS. THIS ESSAY INTENDS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE GOVERNMENT MEASURES ADOPTED ARE FORMALLY LEGITIMATE, GIVEN THAT THEY ARE FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTION.
650	AN UNRESTRICTED STATE WHOSE RIGHTS AND POWERS HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED BEFOREHAND IS A VERY IMPORTANT THREAT TO THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE, AS A RESULT OF EVERY POWER WHOSE BORDERS ARE NOT DRAWN TO THE LAW, THE CONCEPT OF ARBITRARINESS EMERGES, AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING THAT IS DESIRED BASED ON OPPRESSION OR FORCE. THEREFORE, FRIEDRICH AUGUST VON HAYEK ARGUE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE AN AUTHORITY LIMITED BY LAWS, RATHER THAN HAVING UNLIMITED POWER AND AUTHORITY. THE AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO MOVE FROM THE LIBERAL THINKER FRIEDRICH AUGUST VON HAYEK'S LIMITED POWER-LIMITED THE STATE UNDERSTANDING; REVEAL THE THOUGHTS OF THE ABOUT IN WHICH SITUATIONS (MARKET ECONOMY, PRESENTATION OF SERVICE AND PROTECTION OF FREEDOM) THE STATE HAS AUTHORITY AND HOW IT CAN BE USED.
651	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PENAL DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA OVER THE LAST SIX DECADES TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS IN WHICH POPULIST PUNITIVENESS FUNCTIONS IN THE CHINESE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXTS. IT ARGUES THAT POPULIST PUNITIVENESS IN CHINA IS A 'TOP-DOWN' PROCESS WHEREBY MANIPULATIVE POLITICAL ELITES PLAY ON PUBLIC ANXIETIES AND FEARS OF CRIME AND SOCIAL INSECURITY TO SERVE DIFFERENT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. WHILE PUBLIC SENTIMENT WAS PROMOTED AND REFLECTED IN PENAL POLICY IN REVOLUTIONARY (1950S-1970S) AND REFORM (1970S-1990S) CHINA, THEIR INFLUENCE, IN THE POST-REFORM ERA (2000S-), HAS BEEN BLOCKED OR FILTERED BY THE POLITICAL WILL DUE TO THE EMERGENCE OF A SERIES OF MODERATE POLITICAL AGENDAS. A NEW PENAL POLITICS THAT FAVORS PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE OVER PUBLIC OPINION TO SERVE THE COUNTRY'S SOFT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY IS NOW TAKING SHAPE IN CONTEMPORARY PENAL REGIME TO PREVAIL CHINA'S POLICY-MAKING POWER AND PROCESS.

652	THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS THE AUTHOR'S RESPONSES TO FIVE CRITICS OF HIS BOOK LAW AS A LEAP OF FAITH WHOSE CRITICISMS APPEAR IN THIS JOURNAL. THE CRITICS ARE KIMBERLEY BROWNLEE, ANTONY HATZISTAVROU, KRISTEN RUNDLE, SARI KISILEVSKY AND NICOLA LACEY. THE CRITICISMS AND RESPONSES PICK UP THE FOLLOWING FIFTEEN THEMES FROM THE BOOK: LAW, MORALITY, SOCIETY, EXPLANATION, CONTINUITY, RATIONALITY, ENDS, INSTRUMENTS, VALUES, JUSTICE, ALLOCATION, GAMES, MODALITIES, GENERALITIES, JURISPRUDENCE.
653	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES SYMMETRIC AND ASYMMETRIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX AND SUSTAINABLE STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT (SMD) IN PAKISTAN. ECONOMIC FREEDOM CONSISTS OF FOUR CONSTRUCTS NAMELY RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY EFFICIENCY, GOVERNMENT SIZE AND OPEN MARKET. THE STUDY USES NONLINEAR AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (NARDL) AND ARDL MODELS COVERING ANNUAL TIME SERIES DATA (1993-2020). THE RESULTS AFFIRM SIGNIFICANT NONLINEAR RESPONSES OF THE STOCK MARKET FOR POSITIVE & NEGATIVE DECOMPOSITIONS OF THE INDEX WITH ITS CERTAIN COMPONENTS THAT WERE UNADDRESSED BEFORE. THE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY EFFICIENCY DO NOT IMPACT SMD, WHILE GOVERNMENT SIZE AND OPEN MARKET SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT SUSTAINABLE SMD. SIGNIFICANT BI-DIRECTIONAL GRANGER CAUSALITY EXISTS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE OPEN MARKET. EVIDENCE OF BI-DIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY FROM SMD TO THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY EFFICIENCY HAS ALSO BEEN FOUND. THE ARDL FRAME INDICATES THAT LESSER GOVERNMENT-INTERVENED FINANCIAL MARKETS SUPPORTED BY THE RELAXED RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY EFFICIENCY, AND FRAUD-FREE MARKET MECHANISMS SHALL LEAD TO SUSTAINABLE STOCK MARKET DEVELOPMENT. OPEN MARKET AND GOVERNMENT SIZE ULTIMATELY BECOME SIGNIFICANT WITH NEGATIVE COEFFICIENTS. THE PROOFS OF ASYMMETRY PAVE THE WAY FOR INTRODUCING MODIFIED OR STRUCTURAL IMPLICATIONS BY REPLACING RECOMMENDATIONS OF ARDL WITH NARDL FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE POLICY-MAKING WITH ACCURATE FORECASTING. THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EXTRICATE PRECARIOUSNESS IN FUTURE DECISION-MAKING BY ADDING CREDENCE TO EARLIER CONCLUSIONS.
654	IN THIS STUDY, I EXAMINE WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERNAL CONTROL REPORTING (MEASURED THROUGH THE PRESENCE/ ABSENCE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES) AMONG FOREIGN AND U.S. FIRMS. I ALSO EXAMINE THE RELATION BETWEEN INTERNAL CONTROL REPORTING AND THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS USED BY FIRMS (I.E., U.S. AND FOREIGN) IN THEIR SUBMITTED SEC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OVERALL, MY RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOREIGN FIRMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT MATERIAL WEAKNESSES THAN U.S. FIRMS. FURTHERMORE, FOREIGN FIRMS THAT SUBMIT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE PREPARED USING U.S. GAAP OR PREPARED USING THEIR DOMESTIC STANDARDS AND THEN RECONCILED TO U.S. GAAP ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. SINCE COUNTRY SPECIFIC POLITICAL FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE REPORTING OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES I ALSO EXAMINE WHETHER RULE OF LAW IMPACTS THE REPORTING OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. MY RESULTS INDICATE THAT FOREIGN FIRMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS STRONG RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT MATERIAL WEAKNESSES AND FOREIGN FIRMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT MATERIAL WEAKNESSES. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN FIRMS THAT PREPARE THE SEC SUBMITTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS USING IFRS ARE LESS LIKE TO REPORT MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN STRONG RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES AND THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT RELATION BETWEEN IFRS FIRMS AND MATERIAL WEAKNESS REPORTING IN WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES.

655	THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT TWO CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES GOVERN THE ELECTION OF JUSTICES AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE 16 GERMAN STATE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS: DEMOCRACY AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE RECRUITMENT OF CANDIDATES, THE VOTE ON NOMINEES IN STATE PARLIAMENTS, AND THE COMPOSITION OF BENCHES OF THE COURTS IN QUESTION SUPPORT THIS ASSUMPTION. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT A PARTISAN TAKEOVER OF GERMAN STATE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS HAS TAKEN PLACE. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITIES REQUIRED FOR AN APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES OF STATE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS SEEM LESS CRUCIAL THAN IS OFTEN ASSUMED.
656	AFTER A REVIEW OF THE COLOMBIAN CASE AND EVALUATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS ON THE FIGURE OF PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND AREAS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH CLEARLY ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SAME, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE EXISTENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL GAPS THAT CAN BE ABUSED. THEREFORE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE 1991 CONSTITUTION IS A TEXT VULNERABLE TO THE LEADER, BASED ON GOOD FAITH AND IN THE WISE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE, HOWEVER, CAN NOT BE CATALOGUED AS NEITHER GOOD OR BAD, BUT AS FLEXIBLE.
657	THE PRESENT PAPER IS A FIRST APPROXIMATION ON THE DIVERSE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISM IN LATIN AMERICA, STARTING FROM SOME COMMON REFERENCES: FRENCH REVOLUTION, COMPARATIVE LAW, AND ALLUSIONS TO MODERNITY.
658	THE PAPER DEALS WITH BOBBIO'S REFLECTION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT AND PRESENTS THE LAW AS IN-DISPENSABLE TOOL TO PUT SOCIETY ON THE ROAD TO COMMON GOOD. THE ANALYSIS ARGUES THAT THE PROBLEM OF GOOD GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE ANSWERED BY THE SIMPLE SELECTION OF GOOD RULERS. RATHER, THE GOOD GOVERNMENT REQUIRES A COMMITMENT TO STRUCTURE POWER SO THAT LIMITS AND RE-ASONS TO ITS USE CAN BE GIVEN. IN THIS LIGHT, THE LAW REPRESENTS THE WHEREWITHAL TO ENSURE GOOD GOVERNMENT. IN LAST SECTION, BOBBIO'S ARGUMENTS CONCERNING LAW AS PATH TO GOOD GOVERNMENT ARE DISCUSSED LOOKING AT HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE QUEST FOR PEACE.
659	THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS (REVENUE REDISTRIBUTION, DIRECT PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS IN KIND, AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE OR COMPENSATION) OF LOGGING CONCESSIONAIRES TO AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN CAMEROON, GHANA, LIBERIA AND REPUBLIC OF CONGO. THE RESEARCH DRAWS ON A FULL DESK-REVIEW OF RELEVANT LEGAL TEXTS, AND CONSULTATION WITH LEADING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS WORKING IN THE FOREST SECTOR IN THE FOUR COUNTRIES. IT APPEARS THAT THE LEGAL FOUNDATION OF SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS IS MAINLY SHAPED BY NATIONAL CONTEXT, AND THEREFORE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES CAN BE OBSERVED ACROSS COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THEY ARE COMPLEX, INCOMPLETE AND PRECARIOUS, PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELITE CAPTURE, AND COMMUNITIES - AND THE STATE - NOT REAPING THE BENEFITS THEY ARE OWED BY LAW. A KEY CONCLUSION IS THAT LEGALITY-LICENSING SCHEMES SUCH AS UNDER A VOLUNTARY PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (VPA) WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) TEND TO DOWNPLAY SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS COMPARED TO OTHER ASPECTS OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE.
660	ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS KEY FOR BUILDING AND CONSOLIDATING PEACE AND ENHANCING SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN FRAGILE AND POST-CONFLICT STATES. SINCE THE 2000S, LEGAL EMPOWERMENT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR APPROACHES TO IMPROVE SUCH ACCESS, AND A GROWING LITERATURE HAS PRESENTED MIXED EVIDENCE ON THE QUALITY OF ITS OUTCOMES. WE EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF A LOCALLY PROVISIONED LEGAL AID PROGRAM ON JUSTICE-SEEKERS' USE OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION FORA, LEGAL AGENCY, AND TRUST IN JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014 IN 26 MUNICIPALITIES OF RURAL BURUNDI. WE CONSIDER ITS EFFECTS ON 486 BENEFICIARIES USING VARIOUS PROPENSITY SCORE-MATCHING METHODS AND DATA ON NON-BENEFICIARIES FROM TWO DISTINCT CONTROL GROUPS (N = 3,267). FORTY-EIGHT INTERVIEWS WITH KEY INFORMANTS HELP DISCUSS JUDICIAL PRACTICES. WE FIND THAT THE PROGRAM INCREASED THE USE OF COURTS BUT NOT TRUST IN THE JUDICIARY. IT HAD NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT JUSTICE-SEEKERS' PERCEPTION OF THE TREATMENT THEY RECEIVED IN COURTS, ALSO KNOWN AS PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, SHAPED THEIR PERCEPTION OF ACCESSING JUSTICE. QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE ALSO POINTS TO A POSSIBLE 'WATCHDOG EFFECT': IN SOME CASES, THE PRESENCE OF A LEGAL ADVISER MAY HAVE PUSHED JUDGES TO BETTER COMPLY WITH PROCEDURES. WHILE LEGAL AID PROGRAMS CAN IMPROVE ACCESS TO COURTS, IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN AN EROSION OF JUDICIAL 'FORUM SHOPPING' OR THAT TRUST IN STATE INSTITUTIONS IS REINFORCED AND RIGHTS FULLY REALIZED.
661	THE CONCEPT OF THE EQUAL VOTE HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY STUDIED IN THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON ELECTORAL SYSTEMS. HERE WE OFFER A THEORY THAT CLARIFIES AND QUANTIFIES THE TERM. WE DIFFERENTIATE FOUR DISTINCT ELEMENTS WITHIN THE IDEA OF "EQUAL SUFFRAGE", ASSIGNING THREE OF THEM WITH A QUANTITATIVE AND MEASURABLE VARIABLE. SINCE THE EQUAL VOTE HAS AN ENORMOUS PRESENCE IN MANY DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS, CONCEPTUALIZATION AND QUANTIFICATION SHOULD HELP TO DETERMINE THE EXACT MEANING OF THE EXPRESSION AS WELL AS TO PREVENT VIOLATIONS OF VOTING EQUALITY. "EQUAL SUFFRAGE", IS A SUBJECTIVE RIGHT AND CAN BE QUANTIFIED. THIS SHOULD HELP COURTS TO PROTECT IT.
662	IN THIS ARTICLE I COMPARE THE FIRST AND LAST EDITION OF THE INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENCE OF LAW, WRITTEN BY GUSTAV RADBRUCH. I FOCUS ON THOSE ASPECTS THAT DELINEATE HIS CONCEPT OF LAW, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND MORAL, MODEL OF STATE, JUDICIAL CREATION OF LAW, ETC. THE RESULT IS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORICAL AND VITAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TWO EDITIONS; THE FIRST WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR, WHILE RADBRUCH WAS A YOUNG TEACHER. THE SECOND WAS PUBLISHED DURING THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC, AT A TIME AT WHICH OUR AUTHOR HAD BEEN MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND HAD BECOME A WELL-KNOWN JURIST AND PROFESSOR.
663	THE ARTICLE TAKES UP THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM OF THE SO-CALLED DISOBEDIENCE OF JUDGES AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE EXPERIENCES OF THE POLISH DEPARTURE FROM CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN 2015-2020. THE SPECIAL ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF A JUDGE IN THE STATE IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON HER FREEDOM OF OPINION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. OPENLY MANIFESTING OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT POLICY, WHICH IN THE CASE OF AN ORDINARY CITIZEN IS ONLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, MAY BE DESCRIBED AS CONTROVERSIAL AND CONTRARY TO APPLICABLE ETHICAL REGULATIONS. THE MAIN THESIS OF THIS PAPER IS THE ASSERTION THAT ALTHOUGH JUDGES WHO ACT AS IMPARTIAL ARBITRATORS IN DISPUTES SHOULD GENERALLY REFRAIN FROM OSTENTATIOUSLY OPPOSING THE ACTIONS OF POLITICAL AUTHORITIES, THEY ARE NOT DEPRIVED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PROTEST. ALSO IN THE EXERCISE OF OFFICE, AND NOT OUTSIDE THE SPHERE OF THEIR DUTIES, JUDGES SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OVERRIDING MORAL VALUES THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE LEGAL ORDER, AND NOT THE VALUES OR DECLARATIONS GUIDING THE GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THE INTEGRITY OF THE JUDGE, WHICH PRESCRIBES RESTRAINT IN STATEMENTS AND ACTIONS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, AS WELL AS THE CARE FOR THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HELD, SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH ABSOLUTE SUBORDINATION TO THE LEGISLATURE OR THE EXECUTIVE, EVEN IF THE JUDGE IS OBLIGED TO APPLY THE LAW. THE TRADITIONAL ATTITUDE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY, CONSISTING IN FOCUSING ONLY ON THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW IN INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THE LACK OF ANY POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT, IS BEING REVIEWED IN THE FACE OF THE SPREAD OF MAJORITARIANISM AND THE LAW ABUSE AS NORMAL TECHNIQUES OF EXERCISING PUBLIC AUTHORITY. THE DISOBEDIENCE OF JUDGES-ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT TO DEFEND AT FIRST SIGHT-MAY SEEM TO BE THE ONLY POSSIBLE WAY TO DRAW PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THE CORRUPTION OF THE STATE SYSTEM. THE 'DISOBEDIANT' JUDGES CAN EVEN BE ASSIGNED THE ROLE OF 'WHISTLEBLOWERS', WHICH SHOULD HELP TO EASE THEIR LEGAL LIABILITY OR THEIR FUTURE REHABILITATION.
664	THE FUTURE LOOKED BRIGHT FOR ARGENTINA IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. IT HAD ALREADY ACHIEVED HIGH LEVELS OF INCOME PER CAPITA AND WAS MOVING AWAY FROM AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT TOWARDS A MORE OPEN DEMOCRACY. UNFORTUNATELY. ARGENTINA NEVER FINISHED THE TRANSITION. THE TURNING POINT OCCURRED IN THE 1930S WHEN TO STAY IN POWER, THE CONSERVATIVES IN THE PAMPAS RESORTED TO ELECTORAL FRAUD, WHICH NEITHER THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, OR JUDICIAL BRANCHES CHECKED. THE DECADE OF UNCHECKED ELECTORAL FRAUD LED TO THE SUPPORT FOR JUAN PERON AND SUBSEQUENTLY TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
665	A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE EXISTS ON THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN COMBATING CORRUPTION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF LITERATURE ON THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISES, INSTITUTIONS, AND CORRUPTION. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: HOW DOES INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MATTER IN AFFECTING CORRUPTION DURING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE USE A RECENTLY RELEASED HISTORICAL PANEL DATASET CALLED V-DEM FOR OVER 130 COUNTRIES DURING 1800-2020. THE RESULTS SUGGEST SOME HETEROGENOUS EFFECTS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CRISIS AND HOW WE MEASURE IT. FOR EXAMPLE, STRONG INSTITUTIONS CAN CONTROL CORRUPTION IN CASES OF POLITICAL AND CIVIL VIOLENCE AND ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, BUT THE EFFECT DISAPPEARS IN OTHER CRISES SUCH AS DEMOCRACY BREAKDOWNS, COUPS, ARMED-CONFLICT AND CIVIL-WAR AND CURRENCY, INFLATION, AND DEBT CRISIS. FURTHERMORE, STRONG INSTITUTIONS IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES PREVENT CORRUPTION IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY DURING POLITICAL AND CIVIL VIOLENCE.
666	AN APPROPRIATE DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL FOR FIRMS TO ENABLE THEM ALIGN ASSET STRUCTURE TO LIABILITIES TO PREVENT A MISMATCH. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF FIRM-LEVEL AND INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ON DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE IN SELECTED AFRICAN COUNTRIES. USING PANEL GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENT THAT ADDRESSES ENDOGENEITY PROBLEM; OUR FINDINGS REVEAL A DYNAMIC PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT TO OPTIMAL DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE. FURTHERMORE, FIRM-LEVEL VARIABLES (LEVERAGE, ASSET STRUCTURE AND FIRM SIZE) PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE CONTRACTING COST, SIGNALLING AND MATCHING PRINCIPLE THEORIES OF DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURE. RESULTS OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES SUGGEST THAT BETTER DEVELOPED INSTITUTIONS PROMOTE LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITY STRUCTURES.
667	IN THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION, A ZEALOUS JUDICIAL DEFENSE OF PROPERTY IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE IDEA OF "THE RULE OF LAW." CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HOLDS THAT THE TAKINGS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT VINDICATES BOTH PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW BY FORECLOSING ARBITRARY, LAWLESS STATE ACTION. BUT THE STANDARD STORY LINKING PROPERTY RIGHTS, LEGALITY, AND A CONSTRAINT ON ARBITRARY GOVERNANCE IS MORE COMMONLY STIPULATED THAN ANALYZED. THIS ARTICLE USES AN APPARENT SHARP BREAK IN TAKINGS JURISPRUDENCE, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT'S JUNE 2021 DECISION IN CEDAR POINT NURSERY V. HASSID, TO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGALITY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. TO THAT END, IT OFFERS FIRST A CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF THE SHARP RUPTURE THAT CEDAR POINT MAKES IN TAKINGS JURISPRUDENCE. NOT ONLY IS THE COURT'S RESULT DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IN TERMS OF PRECEDENT OR TRADITIONAL LEGAL METHODS, IT ALSO DESTABILIZES A PREVIOUSLY SETTLED AND REASONABLY PREDICTABLE LITIGATION LANDSCAPE. AS A RESULT, IT SEEDS PROFOUND UNCERTAINTY ON THE LEGAL GROUND BECAUSE IT SIGNALS A DISSOLUTION OF THE CONSTRAINING EFFECT FORMERLY REALIZED BY STANDARD TOOLS OF LEGAL REASONING. THERE IS, FURTHER, NO OBVIOUS WAY FOR THE COURT TO RESTORE STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY TO THE DOCTRINE WITHOUT DRAWING NEW, ARBITRARY LINES. IN CONSEQUENCE, TAKINGS LAW WILL LIKELY ABIDE IN CONFUSION, NOT CERTAINTY, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. CEDAR POINT'S VINDICATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS HENCE COMES AT THE PARADOXICAL COST OF DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE SPACE FOR DECISIONS UNGUIDED BY LAW BY ONE GROUP OF OFFICIALS IN THE JUDICIARY.A CLOSE READING OF CEDAR POINT INVITES A MORE GENERAL AND ABSTRACT ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLEX, NUANCED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. DRAWING ON THE GENERAL JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORIES OF H.L.A. HART AND OTHER LEGAL POSITIVISTS, I USE THE DECISION AS A LAUNCHING POINT FOR A LARGER EXPLORATION OF WAYS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE INCOMPLETELY REALIZED TO PARADOXICAL AND EVEN SOCIALLY HARMFUL EFFECT. PLACING PROPERTY AT THE CENTER OF THE RULE OF LAW, I SUGGEST, CAN BE CONSISTENT WITH, OR EVEN AN INCITEMENT TO, SERIOUS DEROGATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. DOING SO CAN UNDERMINE RULE-OF-LAW GOALS, SUCH AS CONSTRAINING ARBITRARY RULE. THIS SUGGESTS A NEED TO DECENTER PROPERTY RIGHTS IN ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO EXPLORE, IN MORE NUANCED AND GROUNDED FASHION, HOW THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW MEDIATES SYSTEMIC VALUES OF LEGALITY AND PREDICTABILITY. IN SHORT, IF WE VALUE THE RULE OF LAW, IT MAY IN GENERAL BE APPROPRIATE TO TAKE A MORE SKEPTICAL, AND SO MORE CONTINGENT, VIEW OF BOTH PROPERTY AS A LEGAL INSTITUTION, AND ALSO THE COURTS AS A SOURCE OF LEGALITY AND STABILITY.
668	THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY IS A MULTILATERAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY THE MOST OFTEN-INVOKED INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WORLDWIDE. A REVIEW OF THE CASE LAW UNDER THE TREATY SHOWS THAT ITS PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED AND APPLIED INCONSISTENTLY BY ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS AND DOMESTIC COURTS. CONSIDERING THE FINANCIAL AND REPUTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION FOR BOTH THE INVESTOR AND THE STATE, A LACK OF 'LEGAL CERTAINTY' ADVERSELY AFFECTS ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES VARIOUS INCONSISTENCIES, SOME OF THE CAUSES, AND PROPOSES SOLUTIONS THAT COULD ENHANCE LEGAL CERTAINTY IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDER THE TREATY. THIS IS A TIMELY CONTRIBUTION AS THE ENERGY CHARTER CONFERENCE HAS RECENTLY TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS TO MODERNISE THE TREATY BY APPROVING A LIST OF TOPICS FOR REFORM, AND IS NOW CONSIDERING TOOLS TO IMPLEMENT FUTURE REFORM MEASURES.
669	THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO FORM A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING AND RESOLVING A SET OF TASKS OF POLICE ACTIVITIES THAT GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS IN MODERN SOCIETY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MOST TYPICAL NEGLIGENCE IN THIS AREA INCLUDES VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS SUCH AS THE INSTALLATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THEM WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF THE CRIME, INCORRECT CHARACTERIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE INFRACTIONS, THE VIOLATION OF THE PROCEDURAL ORDER OF ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION, CASES OF UNJUSTIFIED DETENTION WITHOUT PREPARATION OF REPORTS, AS WELL AS EXCEEDING THE LEGAL DEADLINES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE SET OF MEANS OF APPEAL IN PROCEEDINGS CONCERNING ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES, WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO AS THE INSTITUTION OF THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. COMMON EUROPEAN APPROACHES TO THE LEGAL REGULATION OF POLICING AND THE INFLUENCE OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW AND DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE GUARANTEE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN POLICING WERE ANALYZED.
670	AS NEW TECHNOLOGIES MAKE POSSIBLE NEW MODES OF WAR, THEY CAUSE TENSION IN THE PREVIOUSLY PREVAILING CONCEPTUAL CATEGORIES. THIS IS EVIDENT, AS THE PRACTICE OF TARGETED KILLING BY GOVERNMENTS HAS INCREASED IN FREQUENCY AND PROMINENCE, LARGELY DUE TO THE AMERICAN USE OF ARMED DRONES AROUND THE WORLD. THE ESSAYS IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE EXPLORE HOW NORMS, RULES, AND LAWS THAT MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT WERE SETTLED HAVE BEEN ROILED BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES OF TARGETED KILLING. THIS INCLUDES RULES ON SOVEREIGNTY, TERRITORY, DUE PROCESS, AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CIVILIAN AND COMBATANT. THE ESSAYS SKETCH AN IMPLICIT RESEARCH PROGRAM AROUND THE RECURSIVE RELATION BETWEEN RULES AND PRACTICE. I DRAW THESE OUT INTO A MORE GENERAL MODEL FOR SCHOLARSHIP AT THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS AND BETWEEN CONCEPTS AND PRACTICES.
671	SINCE THE FALL OF SOCIALISM IN EASTERN EUROPE, THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, AND SOME STATES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL DONOR STATES HAVE INITIATED WIDE-SCALE LEGAL-AID PROGRAMMES TO ASSIST THESE STATES IN THEIR TRANSITION FROM SOCIALISM TO A MARKET ECONOMY. WHEREAS THE AID FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS VIS-A-VIS RECIPIENT STATES IS OFTEN AGREED UPON SPECIFIC CONDITIONALITIES, THE DONOR STATES DESIGN THEIR FOREIGN LEGAL AID ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES WITH REFERENCES TO UNIVERSAL GOALS. CURRENTLY, VARIOUS DONOR STATES PROVIDE LEGAL AID TO UZBEKISTAN. GIVEN THE FACT THAT UZBEKISTAN IS THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC THAT STILL BEARS MULTIPLE TRACES OF A SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM AND ADDITIONALLY INTEGRATES INDIGENOUS INFORMAL LAW, THIS RESEARCH PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF HOW DIFFERENT DONOR STATES BASE THEIR LEGAL-AID ACTIVITIES ON ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES AND LEVELS OF GRAVITY, AND HOW RECEPTIVE THE HYBRID STRUCTURE OF UZBEKISTAN'S LAW IS TOWARDS SUCH AID.
672	THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE NEW CIVIL LIABILITY REGIME OF THE STATE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE RECENTLY APPROVED IN THE ANGOLAN LEGAL SYSTEM. THE PROVISION OF THIS CIVIL LIABILITY REGIME REVEALS, ON THE ONE HAND, THE IMPORTANCE THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION HAS ASSUMED IN THIS COUNTRY AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DUTY TO COMPENSATE WHENEVER THAT PRINCIPLE IS VIOLATED, THUS MATERIALIZING, AT THE LEVEL OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LIABILITY OF THE STATE. WHILE IN TERMS OF PRINCIPLES IT CAN BE STATED THAT THE OLD MAXIM "THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG " HAS BEEN SET ASIDE, A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE REGIME ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND, ON THE ONE HAND, THAT NOT ALL SOLUTIONS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE BASIC PREMISES OF THE THEORY OF CIVIL LIABILITY OF THE STATE AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS MAY CREATE AREAS OF IRRESPONSIBILITY, PUTTING THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LIABILITY AFFIRMED AT CONSTITUTIONAL LEVEL INTO CRISIS.
673	THE CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH AFRICA IS LAUDED WORLDWIDE FOR ITS PROGRESSIVENESS. THIS PAEAN STATUS NOTWITHSTANDING, THERE IS AN INCREASING SENSE THAT THE CONSTITUTION'S TRANSFORMATIVE IDEALS ARE GRADUALLY SLIPPING OUT OF REACH. INEQUALITY PERSISTS, WHILE CORRUPTION AND POVERTY ARE INCREASINGLY CRIPPLING THE COUNTRY. THERE IS NO GAINSAYING THAT A CONSTITUTION THRIVES ON ITS BLACK LETTER AND ITS SPIRIT. THE CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH AFRICA RECOGNISES THIS TRUISM BY EXPRESSLY PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN VALUES, SOME OF WHICH ARE EXPLICIT, WHILE OTHERS ARE IMPLICIT. ONE VALUE THAT IS NOT EXPLICIT IN THE VALUES LAID DOWN IN S 1 OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND HAS NOT FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPERIOR COURTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, IS THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MORALITY. THE DOCTRINE BROADLY IMPOSES A MORAL OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE TOTALITY OF THE ETHOS OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE ANIMATING QUESTION THAT THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE IS WHETHER THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MORALITY IS MISSING BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE REALISATION OF ITS LOFTY TRANSFORMATIVE IDEALS. BASED ON AN EMERGENT PARADIGM OF CRITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE ARTICLE HYPOTHESISES THAT THE IDEALS OF TRANSFORMATION WILL BE ATTAINED WHEN THOSE TO WHOM THE CONSTITUTION APPLIES FEEL THE INNATE MORAL OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE TOTALITY OF ITS ETHOS.
674	THE COMMENTARY HIGHLIGHTS THE ANALYSIS OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS' TECHNOCRAT IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING MULTILATERAL POLICY DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS BY PREVENTING, PROTECTING, AND PROSECUTING CRIMES AGAINST THEM. BEING UNESCO THE LEADING COORDINATING UN AGENCY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE POLICIES, THE LESSONS LEARNT FROM THE FIRST DECADE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN PLAN OF ACTION ON SAFETY OF JOURNALISTS AND THE ISSUE OF IMPUNITY ARE THE CROSSCUTTING ELEMENT OF THIS COMMENTARY, PARTICULARLY AIMING TO SUGGEST AREAS OF RESEARCH THAT COULD FURTHER SUPPORT EVIDENCE-BASED POLICYMAKING.
675	IN CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL THEORY, TALKING ABOUT RIGHTS NOT ONLY MEANS TALKING ABOUT THE NORMATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT IT ALSO BECOMES A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CORE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS CONSTRUCTION NOT ONLY RESPONDS TO A BROAD CRITERION OF NORMS THAT ESTABLISH GUARANTEES BUT ALSO DEVELOPS FROM A DOUBLE VISION, BOTH OF A POLITICAL AND LEGAL ORDER, WHERE THE STATE, THROUGH ITS EXISTENCE AND OPERATION, ESTABLISHES THE CONSIDERATIONS TO WHICH ANY SUBJECT CAN ACCESS. SUCH CONSIDERATIONS ARE PRESENTED IN A DOUBLE CATEGORY: HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIS WORK, THROUGH THE USE OF A QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY AND DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, AIMS TO POINT OUT THE COINCIDING AND DIFFERENTIAL ASPECTS BETWEEN ONE CATEGORY AND ANOTHER.
676	THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LEGAL AND NON-LEGAL VALUES CAN BE MADE FROM THE ASPECT OF LEGAL SYSTEM ANALYSIS. SINCE THE CONTENT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF NORMS THAT ESTABLISH SUCH CONTENT, THE PROBLEM OF THE IDENTIFICATION IS CRUCIAL FOR ANY KIND OF CONSIDERATION OF LEGAL VALUES. IN DISCOURSE OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARS, WE CAN RECOGNIZE ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY VALUES WHICH ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTING SOCIAL PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE SUCH AN APPROACH TO LEGAL VALUES AS OPPOSITE TO THE POSITIVISTIC ACCOUNT OF THE LAW AND TO ANALYSE THE MAIN OBJECTION TO THIS NON-POSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE.
677	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES HAVE CONSTITUTED A HIGHLY DISCUSSED TOPIC ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MILLENNIUM ECOSYSTEM ASSESSMENT. THIS IS IN PARTICULAR VALID FOR THE LITERATURE IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AND RELATED ECONOMIC SCIENCES. THE TOPIC HAS GAINED LESS ATTENTION IN OTHER SOCIAL SCIENCES AND UP UNTIL NOW LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE HARDLY TAKEN UP THE ISSUE FOR AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS. MOREOVER IN THE LEGAL PRACTICE THE TERM HAS NOT PLAYED ANY SUBSTANTIAL ROLE APART FROM ITS INCLUSION IN SOFT LAW DOCUMENTS THAT LACK CONCRETE AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF INCLUSION OF THE TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS WITH SUCH MECHANISMS. STARTING FROM A NEUTRAL POSITION, IT DISCUSSES THE POTENTIALS AND PITFALLS OF SUCH AN INCLUSION IN THE LIGHT OF THE ONGOING CONTRADICTORY DISCOURSE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THIS IS DONE BY AN IN-DEPTH REVIEW OF EXISTING ACADEMIC LITERATURE AS WELL AS BY EMPIRICAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH ON EU-LAW, AND BY A CASE STUDY. THIS CASE STUDY CONCERNS THE ON-GOING ASSESSMENT OF THE INCLUSION OF THE TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICES INTO A BINDING LEGAL ACT OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) ON INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES. THE ANALYSIS ALSO COVERS PRIMARY DATA DERIVED FROM QUESTIONNAIRES AND INTERVIEWS COMPLETED BY A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM TWO MEMBER STATES OF THE EU. THE RESULTS PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF THE INCLUSION OF THE TERM ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THIS PARTICULAR CONTEXT OF BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE REGIONAL INTEGRATION LAW BASED ALSO ON A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE. THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EU-REGULATION CAN PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT FOR SIMILAR SITUATIONS OF COORDINATED LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LAW-MAKING AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT. THESE SITUATIONS CAN OCCUR BEYOND A NATION'S BORDERS OR WITHIN. SIMILAR RESEARCH HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET ACCORDING TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE AUTHORS. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF THIS CONTRIBUTION PROVIDE INNOVATIVE INSIGHTS INTO AN ONGOING LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE WITH BINDING RULES ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND USEFUL HINDS FOR SIMILAR OTHER PROSPECTIVE ATTEMPTS WORLDWIDE.
678	AMERICAN IDEOLOGY HAS TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED A BELIEF IN LAW, AND ONE MIGHT UNDERSTANDABLY HAVE EXPECTED HOLLYWOOD MOVIES TO INCORPORATE AND CONVEY THIS MAJOR IDEOLOGICAL TENET. HOWEVER, THE MOST POPULAR LAW MOVIES OF RECENT DECADES REJECT THE BELIEF IN LAW AND INSTEAD PORTRAY LAW AS FLAWED AND UNRELIABLE. THIS DECIDED CINEMATIC ANTI-LEGALISM DERIVES FROM HOLLYWOOD CINEMA'S STANDARDIZED FORMS AND FEATURES, ITS POLITICAL ALIGNMENT, AND ITS FINANCIAL IMPERATIVES.
679	THE ARTICLE INTENDS TO DESCRIBE THE NORMATIVE IDEOLOGY PRESENT IN JUDICIAL MOTIVATION CALLED STATE LEGISLATURE. TO FULFILL THAT PURPOSE WILL BE TRACKED ON THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF THE TERM "LEGAL REASONS", SHALL BE PROVIDED A BRIEF HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT CONCEPT, WE WILL EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND ITS RELATION TO THE LEGAL SYLLOGISM, AND FINALLY WE WILL STATE THE REASONS OF DISAPPOINTMENT OR LOSS OF ITS HEGEMONY. TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED PURPOSE, WE WILL DELVE INTO HEGEMONIC CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL
680	IN THE TRADITIONAL LITERATURE AND LEGAL THEORY, THE THEME OF LAW AND EROS HAS BEEN NEGLECTED AND MISUNDERSTOOD FOR A LONG TIME. THIS RESEARCH RECONSTRUCTS THE LEGAL COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNANCE NETWORK IMAGE AND DESCRIBES MULTIPLE LEGAL DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM PROCESS OF EROTIC GOVERNANCE DEEPLY, BASED ON THE LEGAL PLURALISM IN JOURNEY TO THE WEST. THE FINDING REVEALS THAT EROTIC GOVERNANCE CRISIS OF STATE LAW CREATED OPPORTUNITY AND MOTIVATION FOR LEGAL PLURALISM AND THE PATTERN FROM THE NATIONAL ONE-DIMENSIONAL RIGID CONTROL TO THE COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL GOVERNANCE NETWORK DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY AND LIMITATIONS OF POWER TRANSITION STRATEGY, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE DIRECTION OF LEGAL "META GOVERNANCE" THROUGH SOCIAL EROS.
681	MUCH CONTEMPORARY WRITING ABOUT LAW TREATS POPULAR CULTURE AS A CREATURE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND THE PHENOMENON OF MASS MEDIA. THIS MISUNDERSTANDS BOTH ITS CONTINUITY WITH TRADITIONAL FORMS, AND THE PRECISE DIFFERENCES THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY CREATES. POPULAR CULTURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF LAW AND JUSTICE APPEAL TO A LONGSTANDING TRADITION EVIDENT IN FAMILIAR ARCHETYPES OF COWBOYS AND SUPERHEROES. INDEED, SUCH A TRADITION REACHES BACK TO MUCH OLDER CHRISTOLOGICAL MODELS OF JUSTICE AND SUBJECTIVITY, WHICH MODERNISM HAS DEFLECTED BUT NEVER DESTROYED. ON THE OTHER HAND, HI-TECH MEDIA EMBEDS THOSE TRADITIONS IN TECHNOLOGY'S LANGUAGE OF PASSIVITY AND ITS STRANGE BUT INSISTENT ERASURE OF THE PAST. UNDER CONDITIONS OF THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD, POPULAR CULTURE APPEARS NOT AS THE MEMORY OF PAST THINKING ABOUT LAW, BUT AS AN ECHO. THE IRONY IS THAT WHILE POPULAR CULTURE'S PRESENTATIONS OF LAW APPEAL TO A SUBSTANTIVE TRADITION, THEIR FORMAL HYPER-MODERNITY NOT ONLY NEGATES THAT PAST BUT UNDERMINES THE PLURALIST AND DISCURSIVE OPENNESS WHICH ARE ITS WELL-SPRING. IN A WORLD SHORN OF FAITH IN THE TRADITIONAL STRUCTURES SUSTAINING THE 'MORAL ECONOMY' AND A MORAL LEGALITY, THE APPEAL TO SIMPLY TRUST IN AN INARTICULABLE JUSTICE OPENS THE PROSPECT NOT OF SALVATION BUT OF LEGAL TYRANNY.
682	IN DEMOCRATIC AND PLURALIST SOCIETIES, ALTHOUGH THE OVER-EXPANSION OF CONSCIENTIOUS CLAIMS GIVES RISE TO INCREASING CONCERN, THE RECOGNITION OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION IS A NECESSARY TOOL, NOT ONLY IN ORDER TO MANAGE RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY, BUT ALSO TO BUILD A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY. IN ITALY, ALTHOUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT DOES NOT EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZE A RIGHT TO CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COVERAGE OF THE RIGHT IS GROUNDED ON A JOINT READING OF VARIOUS ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE INCREASING NUMBER OF NEW SHAPES OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION, AND NEW ACTORS CLAIMING THE RIGHT, CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION CAN BE CONSIDERED A NEW STRESS TEST FOR THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE NEW TENSIONS BETWEEN CONSCIENTIOUS CLAIMS AND NEW SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS, WITH A VIEW TO EXPLORING NEW STRIKING BALANCES AIMED AT NEGOTIATING CONFLICTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SETS OF VALUES.
683	THIS ESSAY COMMENTS CRITICALLY A BOOK ON JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE BY PABLO LUCAS MURILLO DE LA CUEVA, PROFESSOR AND MAGISTRATE AT THE SUPREME COURT. IT FOCUSES ON THE BOOK'S OPPORTUNITY, ITS CONTENTS, THE PERSPECTIVES USED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THE ESSENTIAL THESIS SUSTAINED. THE BOOK IS A CLEAR AND REASONED JUSTIFICATION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SELECTION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SPANISH JUDICIAL COUNCIL. BUT IT STUDIES, AS WELL, OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES RAISED BY JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN SPAIN COMBINING THE THEORETICAL APPROACH OF A PROFESSOR AND THE PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF A MEMBER OF SPANISH JUDICIARY.
684	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MEASURES (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW) IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE EMPIRICAL STUDY IS BASED ON PANEL TECHNIQUES (UNIT ROOT TESTS AND CAUSALITY) IN THE PERIOD 2002-2017. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW CAUSE AN INFLOW OF FDI AT THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN FOUND BETWEEN POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LOW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND INFLOW OF FDI. THUS, THE STUDY RECOMMENDED THAT STRONGER INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES CAUSE A HIGHER INFLOW OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS.
685	IS DIGITAL PIRACY-UNDERSTOOD AS ILLEGALLY ACCESSING OR USING COPYRIGHTED WORKS, SUCH AS THROUGH A FILE-SHARING PLATFORM-MORALLY WRONG? SUCH PIRACY TYPICALLY FALLS INTO THE INTRIGUING CATEGORY OF SELF-INTERESTED LAW BREAKING, PERFORMED DELIBERATELY AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A PRINCIPLED DISAGREEMENT WITH THE LAW. EXISTING TREATMENTS OF THE ETHICS OF PIRACY FAIL TO CONSIDER THE FULL SWEEP OF MORAL CONSIDERATIONS IMPLICATED BY SUCH LAW BREAKING, COLLAPSING THE QUESTION INTO DECEPTIVELY NARROW ENQUIRIES. I ARGUE THAT THERE ARE MANY REASONS, SOME STEMMING FROM QUITE SURPRISING SOURCES, FOR RESPECTING COPYRIGHT LAW, EVEN FOR THOSE WHO THINK THE LAW IS UNJUST, ARE SCEPTICAL OF THE LAW'S DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY, AND ARE FRUSTRATED AT THE IMMORAL BEHAVIOUR OF LARGE CORPORATE CONTENT PROVIDERS.
686	LAW FIRMS, BARS AND LAWYERS ASSOCIATIONS QUALIFY AS 'ENTERPRISES' IN THE SENSE OF ALL INTERNATIONAL CSR NORMS SUCH AS THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT, THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES, THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES AND ISO 26000 GUIDANCE ON SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THUS, THESE CSR NORMS APPLY TO LAW FIRMS AND LAWYERS IN PRINCIPLE. LAWYERS ARE, HOWEVER, NOT ONLY SERVICE PROVIDERS. THEY HAVE ALSO AN OFFICIAL FUNCTION BASED ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE COURTS. THEREFORE, THE APPLICATION OF CSR NORMS HAS TO BE ADAPTED TO THE SPECIFIC ROLE AND DUTIES OF THE LAWYERS. THIS APPLIES IN PARTICULAR TO THEIR CAPACITY (1) AS ENTERPRISES AND SUPPLIERS OF SERVICES, (2) AS GATEKEEPERS CONCERNING THE 'CSR-COMPLIANCE' OF THEIR CLIENTS, AND (3) AS 'LEGAL' ADVISORS. AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS LAWYERS' INDEPENDENCE. BESIDES CERTAIN LEGALLY DEFINED RESPONSIBILITIES, LAWYERS ARE NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THEIR CLIENTS AND THEIR DEEDS. A MORE FAR-REACHING RESPONSIBILITY, BASED ON 'SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS' IN LINE WITH THE UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES, RISKS UNDERMINING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE ATTORNEYS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AS THE EXAMPLES FROM THE NAZI REGIME AND MCCARTHY ERA SHOW. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.
687	RECENT LEGAL REFORMS IN CHINA, PARTICULARLY AMENDMENTS IN 2014 TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAW, HAVE ENCOURAGED ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (ENGOS) TO EMBRACE LEGAL STRATEGIES IN THEIR ADVOCACY. HOWEVER, THE WIDER SIGNIFICANCE OF SUCH STRATEGIES REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED AND UNDERESTIMATED. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IN XIAMEN, FUJIAN PROVINCE, WHERE AN ENGO, INCENSED BY THE CONVERSION OF WALKWAYS INTO PARKING SPACES, LED THE FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE LAWSUIT IN THE NAME OF 'PEDESTRIANS' RIGHTS' IN CHINA IN EARLY 2015. BASED ON DIGITAL ETHNOGRAPHY AND PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, THE CASE ILLUSTRATES THREE SALIENT POINTS: FIRST, LEGAL MOBILIZATION IS CONFLICT-LADEN AND CONFRONTATIONAL; SECOND, DEPOLITICIZED LEGAL ACTIONS BELIE THE DEVELOPMENT OF POPULAR CRITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS; AND THIRD, PROFESSIONAL TIES HAVE BECOME MORE INSTRUMENTAL THAN CONNECTIONS WITH STATE OFFICIALS. THE NET RESULT IS THEN AN EMBEDDED ACTIVISM THAT EVINCES DISEMBEDDING TENSIONS. THIS QUESTIONS CONVENTIONAL EXPECTATIONS OVER CHINESE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM, THAT IT IS NON-CONFRONTATIONAL AND OVERDEPENDENT ON PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS. IN ADDITION TO ELUCIDATING THE DISEMBEDDING PROCESSES AND EXPERIENCES ABSENT IN PREVIOUS ENGO LITERATURE, THIS EXPLORATORY RESEARCH OFFERS A SNAPSHOT OF LAWFUL ACTIVISM AMONG ENVIRONMENTALISTS, ILLUSTRATING THE WIDER OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES ACCOMPANYING 'THE TURN TO LAW'.
688	IN THIS CONTRIBUTION WE WILL EXPLORE SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE VISION OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE (AMI) FOR LAW AND LEGAL PHILOSOPHY. AMI CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MONITORS AND ANTICIPATES HUMAN BEHAVIOUR WITH THE AIM OF CUSTOMISED ADAPTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT TO A PERSON'S INFERRED PREFERENCES. SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT DEPENDS ON DISTRIBUTED HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE THAT RAISES A HOST OF UNSETTLING QUESTIONS AROUND CAUSALITY, SUBJECTIVITY, AGENCY AND (CRIMINAL) LIABILITY. AFTER DISCUSSING THE VISION OF AMI WE WILL PRESENT RELEVANT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY OF TECHNOLOGY, INSPIRED BY THE POST-PHENOMENOLOGICAL POSITION TAKEN BY DON IHDE AND THE CONSTRUCTIVIST REALISM OF BRUNO LATOUR. WE WILL POSIT THE NEED TO CONCEPTUALISE TECHNOLOGICAL NORMATIVITY IN COMPARISON WITH LEGAL NORMATIVITY, CLAIMING THAT THIS IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE IMPLICATIONS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AMI. LASTLY WE WILL INVESTIGATE TO WHAT EXTENT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES CAN AND SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRIMINAL LAW, AND WE WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF NON-HUMAN DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
689	THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC HAS CHALLENGED AN ARRAY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN COMPLEX AND UNPRECEDENTED WAYS. LITTLE ACADEMIC WORK, HOWEVER, HAS CONSIDERED THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON CANADA'S COURTS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PARTIALLY FILL THAT GAP BY EXPLORING THE CANADIAN COURT SYSTEM'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 AND THE PROSPECTS FOR ADMINISTERING JUSTICE AMID DISASTERS, ALL THROUGH THE LENS OF RESILIENCE. AFTER TAKING A FORENSIC LOOK AT HOW THE COURT SYSTEM HAS MANAGED THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT ON BY COVID-19, WE ARGUE THAT FEATURES OF RESILIENCE SUCH AS SELF-ORGANIZATION, FLEXIBILITY, LEARNING, AND REFLEXIVE PLANNING CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE DURING FUTURE SHOCKS. WE PROPOSE THAT THE BUSINESS OF JUDGING DURING SHOCKS CAN BECOME MORE INTEGRAL TO THE BUSINESS AS USUAL OF COURT SYSTEMS. IMAGINING SUCH A RESILIENT COURT CAN BE A WAY TO STEP FROM COVID-19 TO THE FUTURE OF CANADA'S COURT SYSTEM.
690	THE EXPERIENCE OF A MIGRATION CRISIS (2015 AND 2016) ON THE EDGE OF SCHENGEN AND EU TERRITORY HAS DEMONSTRATED TWO DIVERGENT DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES. FROM BOTH THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING DEMAND TO PROTECT THE EU'S EXTERNAL BORDERS. THIS REQUIRES TRUST IN BOTH NATIONAL AND EU (FRONTEX) AUTHORITIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE GUARDIANS OF NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN SECURITY. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, NEGATIVE SENTIMENTS TOWARDS MIGRANTS HAVE INCREASED AND CONTINUE TO ARISE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS WITHIN MEMBER STATES. THESE DIVERGING PERSPECTIVES ARE STRUGGLING TO DEVELOP HAND IN HAND WITH THE CURRENT AND REQUESTED ROLE OF THE FRONTEX AGENCY. THERE ARE RISING TENSIONS CONCERNING THE LEGALITY OF MEASURES INTRODUCED ON EXTERNAL BORDERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE EU TERRITORY EFFECTIVELY. THERE IS ENORMOUS DISPARITY BETWEEN THE REQUESTED NORMS AND STANDARDS, AND EU AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH MIRRORS THE STRONG ANTI-MIGRANT SENTIMENT WITHIN CEE MEMBER STATES. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE DISPARITY BETWEEN EU AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS WITH THE MEASURES BEING INTRODUCED ON THE EU'S EXTERNAL BORDER WITH THE WESTERN BALKAN STATES. IT ALSO AIMS TO ANALYZE THE MEDIUM-TERM IMPACT OF THIS DISPARITY AT A NATIONAL AND EU LEVEL FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EFFICIENCY, SOLIDARITY AND LEGALITY. THE MIGRANT INFLUX MAY BE ADDRESSED AS AN EXAMPLE OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW THESE THREE PRINCIPLES OF EU LAW ARE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN CEE MEMBER STATES AS A PART OF THE (POLITICAL, GEOGRAPHICAL AND CULTURAL) MAP OF EUROPE.
691	WHY DO AUTHORITATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS SOMETIMES THRIVE EVEN IN DOMINANT-PARTY REGIMES? THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AS A KEY DETERMINING FACTOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL ENTRENCHMENT OF WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION VIA PRIVATE CORPORATE EQUITY TRANSFERS. SINCE THE POLICY THREATENS PRIVATE CAPITAL, THE DOMINANT PARTY WOULD WANT TO AVOID MASSIVE CAPITAL FLIGHT BY CREDIBLY COMMITTING TO A RESTRAINED PRACTICE OF INDIRECT EXPROPRIATION THROUGH AN AUTHORITATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THAT CAN APPLY A BRAKE TO THE POLICY WHEN IT GOES TOO FAR. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN IN-DEPTH CASE STUDY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH INCLUDES CONDUCTING AN EXPERT SURVEY ON JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THAT TESTS A CRUCIAL OBSERVABLE IMPLICATION OF THE THEORY, AS WELL AS PERFORMING PROCESS TRACING THAT INVOLVES INTERVIEWING SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS ELITES.
692	THE PAPER COMPARES THE INVOLVEMENT OF FOUR REGIONAL ECONOMIC COURTS IN LEGAL DISPUTES MIRRORING CONSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CRISES AT NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEVELS. THESE FOUR JUDICIAL BODIES OF THE EU, THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY, THE EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY AND THE CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM HAVE ALL FACED VARIED FORMS OF RESISTANCE TO THEIR INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR GENERAL AUTHORITY. BY COMPARING THESE FOUR CASE-STUDIES FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES INSTITUTIONAL AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THE UNEVEN RESISTANCE. WHILE THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC COURTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND EAST AFRICA WERE SUBJECT TO BACKLASH FROM THE MEMBER STATES, THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA AVOIDED BACKLASH BUT AT THE PRICE OF ACHIEVING ONLY A NARROW AUTHORITY.
693	AUSTRALIA WAS ONCE A WORLD LEADER IN PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION. TODAY, PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY HAS BEEN UNDERMINED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERLY WIDE DELEGATIONS, UNCRITICAL BI-PARTISAN SUPPORT FOR MEASURES, PARTY DISCIPLINE RESTRAINING OVERSIGHT, ABUSE OF THE DISALLOWANCE PROCEDURE AND PARLIAMENTARY RECESSES TO AVOID PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY, AND INTEREST-GROUP CAPTURE WITHIN GOVERNMENT. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS HAS BEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORTHODOXY IN AUSTRALIA THAT THE COURTS DO NOT INTERVENE IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARLIAMENT AND THE EXECUTIVE. THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT ORTHODOXY. I ARGUE THAT THE COURTS HAVE A PROPER AND NECESSARY ROLE IN PRODDING PARLIAMENTARY OVERSIGHT OF EXECUTIVE POWER, SPECIFICALLY IN THE DELEGATED LEGISLATIVE SPHERE.
694	OVER 10 YEARS AGO, FELD AND VOIGT (2003) INTRODUCED AN INDICATOR FOR OBJECTIVELY MEASURING THE ACTUAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND DEMONSTRATED ITS UTILITY IN A LARGE CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES. THE INDICATOR HAS BEEN WIDELY USED, BUT ALSO CRITICIZED. MANY NEW INDICATORS FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SINCE. YET, ALL OF THEM ARE BASED ON SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS BY EXPERTS OR CONFINED TO MEASURING THE LEGALLY PRESCRIBED LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS MORE RECENT OBJECTIVE DATA ON DE JURE AND DE FACTO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE (JI) AND STRONGLY CONFIRMS PREVIOUS RESULTS THAT DE JURE JI IS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY RELATED TO ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEREAS DE FACTO JI IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ROBUSTLY CORRELATED WITH GROWTH. IN ADDITION, WE SHOW THAT THE EFFECT OF DE FACTO JI DEPENDS ON THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, BUT NOT ON A COUNTRY'S INITIAL PER CAPITA INCOME. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
695	IN DISCUSSIONS OF IMPUNITY, SUCH AS THE ONE SURROUNDING THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, THE CONCEPT OF IMPUNITY ITSELF HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY UNATTENDED. EXAMINING THE CONCEPT MORE CLOSELY REVEALS THAT WE USE IT IN BOTH THIN AND THICK SENSES, THE THIN RELATING TO A CONCERN ABOUT THE VALUES OF PUNISHMENT AND THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THE THICK TO A BROADER NOTION OF EQUALITY, OF WHICH CRIMES BEING PUNISHED (EQUALLY) IS ONE ASPECT, BUT NOT THE TOTALITY OF THE ISSUE. ONLY A THICK VERSION OF IMPUNITY CAPTURES ALL THAT MAKES IT A PROBLEM WE CARE GREATLY ABOUT. ACCORDING TO THIS CONCEPTION, WHAT MAKES IMPUNITY A PROBLEM IS PRIMARILY A FAILURE TO ENSURE EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. THIS CAN SHOW UP IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WHEN A CRIME IS NOT PROSECUTED OR PUNISHED BECAUSE THE OFFENDER BELONGS TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BEYOND THE REACH OF THE LAW. SECOND, WHEN A CRIME IS NOT PROSECUTED OR PUNISHED BECAUSE THE VICTIM BELONGS TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE DEEMED LESS IMPORTANT IN THE EYES THE LAW. INSTITUTIONS AND COURTS OF LAW END IMPUNITY, FIRST AND FOREMOST, BY RESTORING THE EXPERIENCE OF EQUALITY AGAINST PRIVILEGE AND BRUTE POWER. THIS SETS AN IMPORTANT CHALLENGE TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, BECAUSE WHILE THE COURT MAY SERVE MANY IMPORTANT VALUES, ITS CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL FORMATION AND ITS POLITICAL CONTEXT SEEM TO UNDERMINE ITS CAPACITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO END IMPUNITY IN THE THICKER SENSE.
696	THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE XVI CENTURY'S REFORMATION DOCTRINE IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE GROUNDING OF THE LEGITIMACY OF CIVIL POWER, OF ITS LIMITS AND OF THE CONTROL THAT POPULAR WILL EXERCISE ON IT. DEPARTING FROM LUTHERAN POSITION, OF TOTAL SUBMISSION TO THE SOVEREIGN, TO THE INCENTIVE TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE BY JOHN KNOX (IN JUST THIRTY FIVE YEARS), THE THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF CIVIL POWER WAS COMPLETELY REELABORATED TO ACCOMMODATE THE DEEP TRANSFORMATIONS IN SOCIETY, NAMELY THE CHANGING FROM MONARCHIC SOVEREIGNTY TO POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RISING OF RATIONAL LIMITS TO THE RULER'S WILL.
697	THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED ITS JURISPRUDENCE RELATED TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT WAYS. THE COURT HAS RIGHTLY BEEN APPLAUDED FOR ABANDONING ITS REQUIREMENT THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BE PROVED 'BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT' AND FOR ENDORSING THE CONCEPT OF INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION, ALLOWING IT, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, TO BEGIN TO FIND STATES FROM 'EASTERN EUROPE' IN VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTION FOR HAVING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ESPECIALLY ROMA APPLICANTS. WHILE WELCOME, THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD NOT DETRACT FROM THE NEED TO CONTINUE ASKING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: WHY HAS IT TAKEN DECADES FOR THE COURT TO START FINDING A VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 ON GROUNDS OF RACE? WHY ARE CASES, SUCH AS MENSON V. UNITED KINGDOM CONCERNING THE SLOW REACTION OF THE POLICE IN INVESTIGATING THE LETHAL ATTACK OF A BLACK MAN, NOT FOUND ADMISSIBLE? CAN WE EXPECT THE COURT, CREATED IN A REGION WHICH LARGELY BUILT ITSELF UPON COLONIALISM, TO GENERATE MECHANISMS FIT TO TACKLE RACISM? IN THE PAST, JUDGES THEMSELVES HAVE PROVIDED THE MOST VIRULENT CRITIQUE OF THE COURT'S INABILITY TO TACKLE RACISM. MIGRANTS STILL REMAIN TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR PROGRESSIVE STANCE IN RELATION TO ARTICLE 14 CLAIMS BASED ON GROUNDS OF RACE.
698	IN MARCH 1999, THE PEOPLE OF PARAGUAY FOUND THEMSELVES AT AN HISTORICAL CROSSROADS. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, THE LEGACY OF THE 35-YEAR STROESSNER DICTATORSHIP CONTINUED TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF DEMOCRATIC ACTORS TO MAKE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY. THE OLD ONE-PARTY RULE OF THE COLORADOS CONFRONTED BY INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL PRESSURE FOR TRANSFORMATION, LED TO A POLITICAL CRISIS THAT CHALLENGED BOTH NEOLIBERAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND THE LINGERING AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM OF THE DICTATORSHIP. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES A MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATER PROJECT SPONSORED BY THE PARAGUAYAN GOVERNMENT, THE PEACE CORPS AND THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, IN WHICH THE JOINT EFFORT REVEALED TENSIONS BETWEEN EMERGENT FORMS OF DEMOCRATISATION AND THE GOALS OF CAMPESINOS AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. STRUGGLES FOR IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT INTERTWINED WITH NEOLIBERAL MODES OF GOVERNANCE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME YEARS OF LOCAL AUTHORITARIAN RULE. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SOUGHT A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN GOVERNING THEIR AFFAIRS, WHICH LED TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF JUNTAS DE SANEAMIENTO OR 'SANITATION COUNCILS'.
699	BASED ON 2010 TO 2019 CHINESE OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (OFDI) PANEL DATA FROM 39 HOST COUNTRIES, THIS PAPER STUDIES THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HOST COUNTRY CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CHINESE OFDI. THE OLS REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CULTURAL TOLERANCE AND TRUST IN THE HOST COUNTRIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CHINESE OFDI, WHICH ARE ROBUST ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM GMM TESTS. FURTHER ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT CULTURAL TOLERANCE IS MORE POSITIVELY RELATED TO CHINESE OFDI IN HOST COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEGISLATION AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM, WHILE CULTURAL TRUST IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CHINESE OFDI IN HOST COUNTRIES WITH LOWER LEGISLATION AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM. IN ADDITION, HIGHER CULTURAL TOLERANCE AND TRUST PROMOTE CHINESE OFDI IN COUNTRIES WITH GREATER CULTURAL DISTANCE. UNLIKE TRADITIONAL STUDIES BASED ON CULTURAL DISTANCE IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE, USING MORE REPRESENTATIVE CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS, THIS PAPER PROVIDES REFERENCES TO CHINESE OFDI DECISION-MAKING BASED ON THE ROOT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HETEROGENEOUS CULTURAL INFLUENCES.
700	CAN ARBITRATION AND MANDATORY MEDIATION BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO A COURT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS?
701	ALTHOUGH MOST SCHOLARS TRY TO CONCEIVE IMMANUEL KANT'S THEORY OF LAW AND HIS MORAL THEORY AS BELONGING TO A SYSTEM, THERE IS A DIFFICULTY THAT CHALLENGES MOST OF THE INTERPRETERS: IF THERE IS A MORAL CONTENT THAT INFORMS HOW POSITIVE LAW SHOULD BE ENACTED, AND HENCE IF MORALS COULD EVALUATE LAW, WHY DOES KANT SAY THAT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND RESISTANCE TO LAW CANNOT RATIONALLY BE ALLOWED? THIS APPARENT INCONGRUENCE ACQUIRES ANOTHER SIGNIFICANCE WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES THAT KANT ESTABLISHES BETWEEN LAW AND MORALS. IF WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT, WE WILL REALIZE THAT KANT OPERATES A RADICAL SEPARATION BETWEEN MORALS AND LAW, WHICH CAN NO LONGER DERIVE ITS CONTENT FROM MORALS, BUT INSTEAD LOOKS FOR AN INCREASINGLY MORE POLITICAL FOUNDATION IN MODERNITY.
702	MOST SCHOLARLY WRITINGS FOCUS ON THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF INFORMAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. IT DEVELOPS A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING SUCH INSTITUTIONS. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE NORMATIVE EVALUATION OF INFORMAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS IS HIGHLY CONTEXT-SPECIFIC. DEPENDING ON THEIR HISTORICAL TRAJECTORIES, DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS MAY EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT INTERESTS. BECAUSE OF THIS, WHEN EVALUATING INFORMAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, BALANCING THE SAME VALUES MAY YIELD DIFFERENT RESULTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. THE RECENT TREND TOWARDS FORMALIZATION, SUPPORTED BY SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH THE SPREADING NARRATIVE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, EMPHASIZING PRINCIPLES SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY OR INCLUSION, PRINCIPLES THAT GENERALLY STAND IN TENSION WITH INFORMALITY. THIS ARTICLE CAUTIONS AGAINST EMERGING SUPRANATIONAL TEMPLATES INSENSITIVE TO LOCAL PRACTICE.
703	BOTH CRITICS AND ENDORSERS OF THE NEW LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM (NLAC), AS THE WAVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS CARRIED OUT IN VENEZUELA, ECUADOR AND BOLIVIA BETWEEN 1999 AND 2009 IS REFERRED TO, AGREE THAT THESE REFORMS HAVE ALTERED THE COUNTERMAJORITARIAN CONTROL DEVISES IN THE ABOVE COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THIS FINDING SHOWS SOME CONCEPTUAL FLAWS RELATING TO SEVERAL ASPECTS SUCH AS: A) THE NATURE OF THE COUNTERMAJORITARIAN CONTROL DEVICES; B) THEIR LOGIC OF RELATIONSHIP WITH DEMOCRACY; C) WHAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THESE DEVICES REVEALS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF DEMOCRACY ITSELF; D) THE ENTITY WHERE THESE DEVISES AND DEMOCRACY OPERATE, AND FINALLY E) THE ACTUAL NOVELTY OF NLAC COMPARED TO THE PAST WHICH, FROM SOME PERSPECTIVE, LACKED A DEVELOPED SYSTEM OF COUNTERMAJORITARIAN CONTROL. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NEW CONCEPTUAL APPROACH TO RESOLVE, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONCEPTUAL DILEMMAS WHICH NEED TO BE CLARIFIED BEFORE AN EMPIRICAL WORK COULD BE PROPERLY TACKLED.
704	THE COMMENTED JUDGEMENT CONCERNS THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN APPOINTMENT TO THE OFFICE OF A JUDGE IN A PROCEDURE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY A LEGAL DEFECT. IN THE JUDGEMENT IN QUESTION THE SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT HELD THAT A JUDGE OR AN ASSISTANT JUDGE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE COURT APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND IS A(N) (ASSISTANT) JUDGE IN THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND A EUROPEAN JUDGE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE EU TREATIES AND ARTICLE 6(1) OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS EVEN IF THE PROCEDURE PRECEDING THE APPOINTMENT MAY HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE (A POTENTIALLY LEGALLY DEFECTIVE PROCEDURE). AGREEING WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED VIEW, THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT, FIRSTLY, THE DEFINITIVE NATURE OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND DOES NOT, ACCORDING TO THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN STRASBOURG AND OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, PROVIDE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHETHER EACH JUDGE PROVIDES SUFFICIENT GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY DUE TO THE PROCEDURE PURSUANT TO WHICH SHE OR HE WAS APPOINTED. SECONDLY, THE IN ABSTRACTO TEST TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN SOME JUDGEMENTS OF BOTH COURTS (EXAMINING THE LAW AS REGARDS THE LEGALITY OF THE APPOINTMENTS OF JUDGES) ASSESSING THE INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF JUDGES AND WHETHER A COURT IS ESTABLISHED BY LAW, AS OPPOSED TO THE IN CONCRETO TEST APPLIED IN SOME OTHER JUDGMENTS OF BOTH COURTS (CONCERNING THE CONDUCT OF A GIVEN JUDGE IN A GIVEN CASE, PRECLUDING THE QUESTIONING OF JUDGEMENTS SOLELY ON THE GROUND THAT THEY WERE ISSUED BY PERSONS APPOINTED AT THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY), INFRINGES THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, WHICH CONSTITUTES AN ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIRDLY, SUCH DUALISM IN EUROPEAN JURISPRUDENCE CONSEQUENTLY LEADS TO A DESTABILISATION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, WHICH IS OPPOSED BY THE JUDGEMENT UNDER COMMENT.
705	PURPOSE: THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ADVANCES IN THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE CZECH PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SINCE THE 1990S. TRANSPARENCY IS SUBTLY INTERTWINED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY, PROMOTES DEMOCRACY, AND HELPS TO PREVENT MISUSE OF POWER OR OTHER TYPES OF ILLEGAL ACTING. THUS, THE RIGHT TO ACCESS INFORMATION MUST BE INTERPRETED BROADLY ENOUGH, YET THERE ARE OTHER RIGHTS SUCH AS PRIVACY OR TRADE SECRETS WHICH MUST BE RESPECTED AT THE SAME TIME. THE PAPER THEREFORE EXPLAINS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE RIGHTS THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THROUGH YEARS OF COURT INTERPRETATION. IT EXPLORES THE ADVANCES IN THE COURTS' VIEWS AND THE RESULTING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHOR STUDIES THE CRUCIAL PROVISIONS OF THE ACT ON FREE ACCESS TO INFORMATION. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE INTERPRETATION BY THE CZECH SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT AND THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE MOST QUESTIONABLE ISSUES - SUCH AS THE DETERMINATION OF WHICH PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE CONSIDERED OBLIGED ENTITIES, THE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE DUTY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION, REMEDIES, AND PAYMENTS FOR COMPLICATED DATA SEARCHES - THE PAPER SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE PAST 23 YEARS. THE PAPER ALSO SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OUTCOMES OF THE ANALYSIS, I.E. THE CONFIRMED ADVANCES, AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY OD ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES WHICH SHOULD THEORETICALLY RESULT THEREFROM. FINDINGS: THE CASE LAW ON THE INTERPRETATION OF INDIVIDUAL LEGAL PROVISIONS IS RATHER FAVOURABLE TO A BROAD ACCESS TO INFORMATION, RESTRICTING THE EXEMPTIONS AND OTHER OBSTACLES. HOWEVER, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN ORDER TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE GAINS IN THE AREA OF FREE ACCESS TO INFORMATION BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE CAREFULLY ARGUED CASE LAW AND SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENTS OF THE OBLIGED ENTITIES APPROACH, THE RESULTING ACCOUNTABILITY STILL NEEDS TO BE ELABORATED. ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD: THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE BY ADDRESSING THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF LAWS ON TRANSPARENCY ISSUES. IT SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF COURT SUPPORT TO AN INTERPRETATION BROAD ENOUGH TO BALANCE OTHER RIGHTS, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. IT PROVIDES A BACKGROUND FOR FURTHER RESEARCH OF THE CONSEQUENCES, I.E., ACCOUNTABILITY. ORIGINALITY/SIGNIFICANCE/VALUE: AN OVERVIEW OF THE EVOLUTION OF COURT DECISIONS INTERPRETING CONTROVERSIAL LEGAL PROVISIONS IS PROVIDED. THE GAPS BETWEEN THE ADVANCES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE THEORETICALLY RESULTING ACCOUNTABILITY ARE IDENTIFIED.
706	THE RATIFICATION AND DOMESTICATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS COULD BE USED AS INDICES TO DETERMINE A STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF, AND RESPECT FOR, HUMAN RIGHTS. WITHIN MUNICIPAL LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE JUDICIARY IS ONE OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FULFIL THESE TASKS. AS ONE OF THE ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT, IT CAN PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DEFINING THE CONTENT AND EVOLUTION OF BOTH DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. EVEN THOUGH A STATE PARTY TO NUMEROUS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS, A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF CAMEROON'S INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS REVEALS THAT THERE IS A CONSPICUOUS INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THESE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS AND THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE POWER OF THE JUDICIARY, AS STIPULATED IN THE CONSTITUTION, IS VERY LIMITED. THIS PAROCHIAL MANDATE HAS HAD A HEAVY TOLL ON FIRST, THE DEMOCRATIC EVOLUTION OF THE COUNTRY; AND SECONDLY, ON ENSURING THE PROMOTION, PROTECTION OF, AND RESPECT FOR, HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE JUDICIARY IN CAMEROON SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN ENHANCING DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. TO DO THIS, THE JUDICIARY MUST UNDERGO A PARADIGM SHIFT FROM A COMPLACENT AND DISTURBING JUDICIAL INERTIA TO JUDICIAL ACTIVISM.
707	SINCE 2001, CHINA HAS, OVERALL, RESPECTED THE COMMITMENTS IT MADE WHEN IT JOINED THE WTO. HOWEVER, NO "WTO SPIRIT" HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT MIGHT HAVE LED IT TO GO BEYOND THE LETTER OF THESE COMMITMENTS, AND VERY MANY NON-TARIFF BARRIERS ARE STILL IN PLACE. IN VIEW OF THE MODERNISATION OF ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK, IS THERE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD ENABLE FOREIGN COMPANIES TO FIND THEIR PLACE MORE EASILY IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING MARKET, OR DO STRUCTURAL OBSTACLES STAND IN THE WAY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS HOPED FOR BY ITS MAIN PARTNERS?
708	THIS STUDY'S MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO BUILD AN INTER-RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROBLEMS GENERATED BY A DEVELOPING DEMOCRACY AGAINST THE POSSIBLE EXISTING OBSTACLES TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIAL CONTROL IN CONTEMPORARY BRAZIL. SO, SEEK TO CONFRONT AND DEBATE THROUGHOUT CONTEMPORARY HISTORY WHICH CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A DEVELOPED DEMOCRACY, PERMEATING IN THE PROBLEMS OF THE MODERN STATE, WHICH PRESUPPOSE A POLITICAL MOBILIZATION OF SOCIETY. ALSO, SEEKS TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING ISSUES SUCH AS THE NEED FOR FORMATION OF A CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION WITH TRADITION AND AWARENESS OF THEIR ROLE IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE. FROM THIS, THE WORK INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OR NOT OF A SUBSTANTIAL DEMOCRACY AND NOT ONLY FORMAL AND ITS IMPLICATIONS REGARDING THE SEARCH FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE CITIZEN AS A CITIZEN OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE. THAT IS: WHICH ARE THE BURDENS BORNE BY THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THE ARENAS OF DEBATE AND REFLECTION ARE TENTATIVELY OFFERED OR HARDLY EFFECTED, SEEKING TO BREAK UP WITH BUREAUCRATS AND STATE DECISION-MAKING MODEL THAT PREVAILED IN THE FORMATION OF THE MANAGEMENT MODEL OF RES PUBLIC IN BRAZIL.
709	MANUEL ATIENZA'S THEORETICAL PROPOSAL, EXPRESSED IN EL DERECHO COMO ARGUMENTACION, CONTAINS A POTENTIAL FACTOR FOR THE SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF LEGAL PRACTICE. THROUGH THE CATEGORIES AND CONCEPTS OF HANNAH ARENDT, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE INCIDENCE OF POST-POSITIVIST CURRENTS IN POLITICAL CHANGE, SPECIFIC ARGUMENTATION AS A FORM OF POLITICAL ACTION IN FAVOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW.
710	THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS IN RUSSIA. THE STUDY IS BASED ON DATA COLLECTED THROUGH PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION IN RUSSIAN CRIMINAL COURTS IN 2014-2015. I FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING TOPICS: PUBLIC ACCESS TO JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, THE ORIENTATION OF JUDGES TOWARDS THE AUDIENCE, CEREMONIAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES OF SOCIAL INTERACTION AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE SOCIAL STATUS OF A DEFENDANT DURING TRIALS. IN THE THEORETICAL SECTION, I OUTLINE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A THEATRICAL PLAY AND A COURT HEARING. UNLIKE IN A THEATER, IN A COURTROOM PLAYING A ROLE HAS CONSEQUENCES. HOWEVER, THE CONCEPT OF PERFORMANCE REMAINS USEFUL IN DESCRIBING COURT HEARINGS. THE ARTICLE OFFERS THREE EXPLANATIONS OF THE PERFORMATIVITY OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS: POLITICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROACHES IS RELATES TO THE TYPE OF AUDIENCE FOR WHICH TRIALS ARE PERFORMED: ORDINARY CITIZENS, THE JUDGE, OR THE DEFENDANT. ANALYZING THE RESULTS OF OBSERVATIONS, THE STUDY TRIES TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHO IS THE MAIN AUDIENCE IN RUSSIAN COURTS. THE RELUCTANCE TO MAKE COURT HEARINGS MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE TO LAY PEOPLE, DISREGARD FOR PROCEDURAL RULES, THE VIOLATION OF DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS, THE FREQUENTLY REDUCED PROCEDURES FOR EXAMINING CRIMINAL CASES-ALL THESE FACTORS AFFECT PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF RUSSIAN COURTS AS PLACES WHERE FAIR JUSTICE IS PRODUCED. I CONCLUDE THAT TRIALS IN RUSSIA ARE A THEATER WITHOUT A PUBLIC, AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT ADVERSITY, AND A RITUAL WITHOUT SACREDNESS. JUDGES ARE ENGAGED IN ROUTINE BUREAUCRATIC ACTIVITIES WHERE LITTLE SPACE REMAINS FOR MAKING PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENTS AND APPLYING JUDICIAL DISCRETION.
711	ORIGINAL AND MAGISTERIAL, PATRICK MACKLEM'S THE SOVEREIGNTY OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTS RADICALLY FROM THE MORAL AND POLITICAL CONCEPTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW (IHRL) THAT DOMINATE THE LITERATURE. RATHER THAN GROUNDING HUMAN RIGHTS ON FEATURES OF OUR SHARED HUMANITY (THE MORAL, ORTHODOX CONCEPTION) OR ON THEIR ROLE IN GLOBAL POLITICS (THE POLITICAL CONCEPTION), MACKLEM CLAIMS THAT THE POINT AND PURPOSE OF IHRL IS TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE STRUCTURE AND OPERATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ITSELF AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ITS DISTRIBUTION OF SOVEREIGNTY TO SOME ENTITIES - STATES - AND NOT OTHERS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I SUGGEST THAT MACKLEM'S MITIGATION THEORY SUCCEEDS ADMIRABLY IN EXPLAINING VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS THAT MORAL AND POLITICAL THEORIES ARE HARD-PRESSED TO EXPLAIN, SUCH AS COLLECTIVE RIGHTS AND LABOUR RIGHTS. THE GREAT VIRTUE OF HIS THEORY IS THAT IT RECOGNIZES THE POTENT ABUSES INTERNATIONAL LAW'S DISTRIBUTION OF SOVEREIGNTY MAKES POSSIBLE AND THEN CALLS ON IHRL TO SERVE A REMEDIAL AND LEGITIMATING FUNCTION FROM WITHIN INTERNATIONAL LAW ITSELF. MACKLEM, HOWEVER, SUBSCRIBES TO A POSITIVIST LEGAL THEORY THAT IS CLOSER TO JOHN AUSTIN'S COMMAND THEORY THAN IT IS TO HLA HART'S OR JOSEPH RAZ'S POSITIVISM. AS A CONSEQUENCE, MACKLEM STRUGGLES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE AUTHORITY OF IHRL. I SUGGEST A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT THAT WOULD LET MACKLEM'S THEORY ACCOUNT FOR IHRL'S AUTHORITY. THE WAY FORWARD IS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A RELATIONAL CONCEPTION OF IHRL. THIS CONCEPTION TRADES ON A CRITERION OF LEGITIMACY ACCORDING TO WHICH IHRL'S AUTHORITY IS CONSTITUTED BY ITS CAPACITY TO EMPOWER LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO SPEAK IN THE NAME OF, OR ON BEHALF OF, WHOMEVER IS SUBJECT TO THEM.
712	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE REGULATORY HANDBOOKS PRODUCED BY THE NEW REGULATORS FOR SOLICITORS AND BARRISTERS, THE MAIN LEGAL PROFESSIONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES, FOLLOWING THE LEGAL SERVICES ACT 2007. IT FOCUSES ON THE NEW CODES OF CONDUCT AND THE 10 HIGH-LEVEL REGULATORY STANDARDS THAT ARE A FEATURE OF EACH HANDBOOK. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH KEY INTERESTS HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE HANDBOOKS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVES OF THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS AND THEIR PUBLICATIONS, INCLUDING THEIR PREVIOUS CODES OF CONDUCT. IT IS FOUND THAT THE BARRISTERS' AND SOLICITORS' CODES PROJECT DIFFERENT ETHICAL ORIENTATIONS TOWARDS THE SUPPOSEDLY UNIVERSAL 'STANDARD CONCEPTION OF THE LAWYER'S ROLE' BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF NEUTRALITY AND PARTISANSHIP. THE ORIGINS, MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HIGH-LEVEL STANDARDS ARE CONSIDERED. THEY ARE FOUND NOT TO REFLECT THE CONTENT OF THE CODES OF CONDUCT OR TO COMMUNICATE CHERISHED ELEMENTS OF THE PROFESSIONS' HISTORICAL NARRATIVES. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF THE PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONS OF REGULATION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION.
713	THE PIECE RESPONDS TO CRITICS OF SCHEUERMAN'S END OF LAW: CARL SCHMIT IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. DESPITE OUR DISAGREEMENTS, THE BOOK'S CRITICS AND I SHARE THE VIEW THAT SCHMITT SPEAKS TO OUR TIMES, ALBEIT IN DEEPLY TROUBLING WAYS. PRECISELY HOW AND WHY SCHMITT REMAINS PERTINENT, HOWEVER, REMAINS A MATTER OF DISPUTE. INSPIRED BY THE UN-SCHMITTIAN HOPE THAT DELIBERATION MIGHT BUTTRESS OUR COMMON QUEST TO OVERCOME DEMOCRACY'S PRESENT CRISIS, MY RESPONSE ENDEAVOURS TO IDENTIFY THOSE DISAGREEMENTS. THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THEM SATISFACTORILY, MY AIM IS TO ADVANCE OUR CONVERSATION. MOST IMPORTANT, THE CRITICS AND I DISAGREE SOMEWHAT ABOUT HOW BEST TO UNDERSTAND SCHMITT'S RELATIONSHIP TO CONTEMPORARY AUTHORITARIAN POPULISM.
714	PUBLIC POLICIES DESIGNED TO ADVANCE GOVERNANCE REFORM WITHOUT THE CORRESPONDING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS THAT SECURE DEMOCRATIC VALUES CAN EXACERBATE THE POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLICIES' TARGETS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES INDIA'S POST-LIBERALIZATION CHANGES THROUGH THE GOVERNANCE PARADIGMS OF NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOCRACY. USING THE CASE OF DIRECT BENEFITS TRANSFER REFORM, IT TRACES THE EMERGENCE OF TECHNOCRACY AS A GOVERNANCE PARADIGM. IT DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF TECHNOCRACY'S COMPLEMENTARITY WITH CONTEMPORARY POPULISM FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF SOCIAL CITIZENSHIP. IT MAKES A CASE FOR A NEO-WEBERIAN TRANSFORMATION THROUGH A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO A LEGAL APPROACH TO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THE PUBLIC'S FAITH IN THE ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF EMANCIPATION AND SOCIAL PROGRESS. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY IN NON-WESTERN CONTEXTS, IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRIORITIZATION OF MANAGERIAL INNOVATIONS IN GOVERNMENT OVER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. IN THAT CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES TWO CENTRAL POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS: CENTER DOT THE POWERS OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION SHOULD BE EXERCISED TRANSPARENTLY AND BY ESTABLISHING A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP TO THE FORMALLY STATED POLICY OBJECTIVES. CENTER DOT THE OPERATIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE SHOULD BE STRUCTURED IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE GOALS OF BOTH DISTRIBUTIVE AND PROCEDURAL JUSTICE.
715	THIS ARTICLE RESPONDS TO JOCELYN STACEY'S "THE ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY AND THE LEGALITY OF DISCRETION IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW." IN HER ARTICLE, STACEY ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH THE LEGITIMACY OF UNFETTERED EXECUTIVE DISCRETION TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, BUT THE JUSTIFICATION THAT SHE PROVIDES IS NOT UP TO THE TASK. SHE ASSERTS THAT ALL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE EMERGENCIES, BUT SHE DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE SO. SHE PROPOSES TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM OF EXECUTIVE DISCRETION BY REDEFINING THE RULE OF LAW, THEREBY RENDERING IT AN EMPTY SHELL. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE RULE OF LAW DO NOT PUSH IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. INSTEAD, IT IS THE LOSS OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT ALLOWS GOVERNMENTS TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT THEY WISH ALTERNATIVELY TO SAVE AND SACRIFICE. THE SOLUTION TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW DEMANDS IS NOT UNFETTERED DISCRETION BUT BETTER ABSTRACTION IN RULES OF GENERAL APPLICATION. BOUNDLESS AUTHORITY TO RESPOND TO "ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY" IS AN UNBEARABLE LICENCE TO MAKE THINGS UP ON THE GO.
716	THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF A MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE FACTOR FOR THE STABILITY AND CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY. TURKEY HAS HAD A WEAK MARKET ECONOMY WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW, CAUSED IN PART BY AN UNPLANNED AND IRRATIONAL STATE ALLOCATION OF RENTS. JUST AS THE EUROPEAN UNION PROMOTED DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND GREECE, IT CAN ACCELERATE THE TRANSFORMATION OF TURKEY'S ECONOMY AND FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION OF TURKEY'S DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THE POSTPONEMENT OR INTERRUPTION OF TURKEY'S ACCESSION PROCESS RISKS INCREASING POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN TURKEY AND THE REGION. INTEGRATION IS IN THE INTERESTS OF BOTH THE EU AND TURKEY.
717	THE RULE OF LAW IS CENTRAL TO OUR NOTION OF GOVERNANCE AND OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. THE IDEAL OF A KNOWABLE, REGULAR, PUBLIC LAW SHIMMERS IN THE DISCOURSE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IT STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE ARBITRARY AND OFTEN DESPOTIC LAW OF MEN, IN WHICH THOSE WITH ABSOLUTE POWER RULE ABSOLUTELY. BUT THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS. TO MOVE PAST THE IDEALISM IS TO ENTER A CONTESTED REALM WHERE COMPETING THEORIES SEEK TO CLAIM THE MANTLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THIS ARTICLE CANNOT CLAIM TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE OVER THE PRECISE MEANING OR CONSTRUCT OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT DOES SEEK TO CONSIDER THE ROLE THAT JURY NULLIFICATION PLAYS IN OUR REPUBLICAN DEMOCRACY. IN SO DOING, A MORE NUANCED CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW EMERGES-ONE GROUNDED IN THE DAILY REALITIES OF THE LIVES THE LAW WOULD GOVERN. THIS NEW VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW INCLUDES, IF NOT AT TIMES ENCOURAGES, THE POSSIBILITY OF NULLIFICATION. JURY NULLIFICATION ERODES THE FORMAL PARADIGM SURROUNDING LAW. THE AUDACITY OF A JUROR DEFINING LAW SPEAKS OF SOME SMALL SPACE WHERE LAW IS CONSTRUCTED AND GIVEN MEANING OUTSIDE THE HALLS OF FORMAL GOVERNMENT. IT SUGGESTS A LAW THAT IS MORE THAN THE WRITTEN WORD OF STATUTES, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, OR JUDICIAL OPINIONS, BUT IS AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE WRITTEN WORD AND THE CITIZEN'S INTERPRETATION OF THAT WORD. IN ITS VERY NATURE, NULLIFICATION POINTS TO A CITIZEN JUROR AS A SOURCE OF THE LAW ITSELF. IT PUSHES AGAINST STATIC CONSTRUCTS OF LAW AND SEEKS TO INJECT COMMUNITY-BASED IDEALS OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY INTO THE LARGER BODY OF LAW. IN PLACING NULLIFICATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE RECOGNIZES THE DEMOCRATIC FUNCTION OF THE CRIMINAL JURY AND ASSERTS THAT NULLIFICATION PROMOTES THAT FUNCTION. IN DOING SO, IT CONSIDERS HOW THE CITIZEN'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEVELOPED IN LIGHT OF CHANGING NOTIONS ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JURY'S ROLE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW, CONCLUDING THAT NULLIFICATION IS CONSISTENT WITH NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW; INSTEAD, NULLIFICATION PROMOTES AN ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE CITIZEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND DECONSTRUCTION OF THE LAW ITSELF
718	THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE CONDITIONS AND ABSOLUTE POVERTY REDUCTION IN BRICS COUNTRIES FROM 1997 TO 2011. THE STUDY EMPLOYS KAO'S COINTEGRATION FOLLOWED BY FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (FMOLS) AND DUMITRESCU-HURLIN CAUSALITY TESTS. THE INVESTIGATION IS BASED ON SIX INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES OF GOVERNANCE CONDITIONS (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW) THAT EXPLAIN HOW THE POVERTY RATE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY DEEP-ROOTED POOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE STUDY'S MAJOR FINDING SHOWS THAT RULE OF LAW IS THE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNANCE CONDITION THAT DIRECTLY HELPS IN POVERTY REDUCTION IN BRICS COUNTRIES. OTHER GOVERNANCE CONDITIONS AFFECT POVERTY RATES VIA INCOME AND DISTRIBUTION EFFECTS. THIS SUPPORTS THE ASSERTION THAT STRICT COMPLIANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IS THE SIGNIFICANT GOVERNANCE CONDITION FOR POVERTY REDUCTION. WHEREAS, IN THE SHORT-RUN ONLY ECONOMIC GROWTH SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO ABSOLUTE POVERTY REDUCTION. THEREFORE, BRICS COUNTRIES SHOULD FOCUS ON GROWTH-ENHANCING SECTORS AND STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW TO ACHIEVE LOWER POVERTY RATES.
719	THE PAPER FOCUSES ON AN UNDERSTUDIED ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATES AND THEIR DIASPORAS-EMIGRATION POLICIES ATTRACTING DIASPORA INVESTMENT. I FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER RULE OF LAW FACE PARTICULARLY STRONG INCENTIVES TO ADOPT DIASPORA ENGAGEMENT POLICIES AND ENGAGE IN INITIATIVES ATTRACTING DIASPORA INVESTMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER RULE OF LAW. THIS ARGUMENT IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH AN INVESTMENT GAME BETWEEN MIGRANT INVESTORS AND GOVERNMENTS WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS OF RULE OF LAW. IT IS TESTED BY USING THE DATA FROM MULTIPLE LEVELS OF ANALYSIS: ORIGINAL AND EXISTING DATA EXAMINING THE INSTANCES WHEN TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS REACH OUT TO THEIR DIASPORAS FOR INVESTMENT AND BILATERAL FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND MIGRATION DATA.
720	THE MONTERREY CONSENSUS INCLUDES THE IDEA THAT FOREIGN AID IS MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN TARGETED TO COUNTRIES WITH SOUND INSTITUTIONS. WE EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH FOREIGN AID, BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL, IS "SELECTIVE" IN TERMS OF DEMOCRACY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THAT MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE IS MORE SELECTIVE THAN BILATERAL AID IN TARGETING COUNTRIES WITH GOOD RULE OF LAW. "SELECTIVITY" IS A NEW PHENOMENON. DURING 1984-89, BOTH BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AID HAD SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH RULE OF LAW; BY 2000-03 THIS HAD SHIFTED TO A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP FOR MULTILATERAL AID, AND A POSITIVE BUT STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP FOR BILATERAL AID.

721	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS DEPENDENT ON CO-OPERATION WITH ITS NEIGHBOURS TO CREATE A "SPACE OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW". THEREFORE, TOPICS OF DOMESTIC AND JUDICIAL POLICY - ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION, DOMESTIC SECURITY, THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM - ARE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY. FURTHERMORE, HOME AFFAIRS POLICY AND JUDICIAL POLICY ARE INSEPARABLE FROM DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, THE KEY ISSUES IN THE ENP AS A WHOLE. HOWEVER, IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER CONDITIONALITY IS EFFECTIVE AS LEVERAGE FOR TRANSFORMATION. FURTHERMORE, CONFLICTING AIMS EXIST BETWEEN CO-OPERATION IN SECURITY POLICY AND REFORM GUIDELINES IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS ARE THEREFORE MODEST SO FAR.
722	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A BRUTALLY CONDENSED HISTORY OF THE EGYPTIAN LEGAL ELITE, TRACING THEIR RISE TO POWER FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGAL REFORMS IN THE LATE 19TH CENTURY, THEIR FALL IN THE 1950S, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A RENEWED ELITE STATUS BASED ON 'RULE OF LAW' REFORMS INTRODUCED SINCE THE 1990S. I ARGUE THAT 'RULE OF LAW' REFORMS HAD A CONSIDERABLE EFFECT IN RAISING THE PRO. LE OF EGYPTIAN LEGAL PRACTITIONERS AND EMPOWERING THEM AS INSTRUMENTAL DECISION MAKERS ON MULTIPLE QUESTIONS OF PUBLIC CONCERN. IN PARTICULAR, I ARGUE THAT THE HISTORY OF THE EGYPTIAN LEGAL ELITE MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO EITHER EMBRACE THE RULE OF LAW AS A PANACEA OR DISMISS IT OUT OF HAND AS A COLONIAL PLOY.
723	WE USE A HAND-COLLECTED DATASET OF FIRM-LEVEL FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN CHINA TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF HOME COUNTRIES' INSTITUTIONAL ELEMENTS ON THE INVESTMENT COMOVEMENT BETWEEN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC FIRMS. WE FIND THAT FOREIGN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED FINANCIAL MARKETS OR A STRONG RULE OF LAW EXPERIENCE LESS COMOVEMENT WITH CHINESE DOMESTIC FIRMS. OUR EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS A CONTINGENCY IMPACT BETWEEN THE TWO CHANNELS OF HOME COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS; THE CAPITAL MARKETS EFFECT EXISTS ONLY FOR FOREIGN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH STRONG RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS THE RULE-OF-LAW EFFECT HOLDS ONLY FOR FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED FINANCIAL MARKETS. FINALLY, WE SHOW THAT FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH BETTER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY EXHIBIT GREATER INVESTMENT EFFICIENCY THAN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER INSTITUTIONS.
724	THE RULE OF LAW IS A FOUNDATION OF THE LIBERAL STATE. THE US 'WAR ON TERROR' UNDER PRESIDENTS BUSH AND OBAMA THREATENED AND VIOLATED THE RULE OF LAW IN MULTIPLE WAYS. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS THOSE CHALLENGES AND ANALYSES HOW US INSTITUTIONS RESPONDED IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE CAPACITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO RESIST POLITICAL PRESSURE IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS.
725	THE PRESENT ARTICLE AIMS THE REFLECTION ABOUT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RIGHTS TO SECURITY AND PUBLIC PEACE, VISUALISED AT THE CONCRETE LEVEL AND LED TO DISCUSSION IN THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH THE CLAIM OF NON-COMPLIANCE WITH A FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPT (ADPF) N. 187, EMPHASIZING THE ESSENCIALITY OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ASSEMBLY FOR THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF DEMOCRACY.
726	THIS STUDY PROVIDES A PRESENTATION OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST WITHIN THE SLOVAK APPROACH TO LEGAL SCIENCE. THE SECOND DIMENSION IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST AT THE TIME OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPRESS THE RULE OF LAW. THIS HYPOTHESIS CONFRONTS THE LEGAL PRACTICE OF THE SLOVAK ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES WITH THE GOVERNMENT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE REQUIREMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PART OF THE STUDY , ESPECIALLY IN THE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS OF THE LEGITIMACY OF DECISIONS MADE THAT DIRECTLY INTERFERED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ADDITION TO CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, SEVERAL DECISIONS OF THE SLOVAK AND CZECH JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ARE THE BASIS OF THE SUBJECT UNDER REVIEW IN ADDITION TO CONFIRMING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE STUDY ALSO DRAWS ATTENTION TO SEVERAL CRITICAL MOMENTS OF SLOVAK PRACTICE DURING A PANDEMIC. IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS THE ISSUE OF PROPORTIONALITY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPORTIONALITY TEST. IN ADDITION TO THE MEDICAL DIMENSION, THE FIGHT AGAINST A PANDEMIC IS ALSO A TEST OF THE RULE OF LAW BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES.
727	ALTHOUGH CRIMINAL JURISDICTION IS USUALLY EXERCISED BY GOVERNMENTS, OFFENCES CAN ALSO BE PROSCRIBED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND PUNISHMENT CAN BE IMPOSED BY INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE LEGITIMACY OF SUCH EXERCISES OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JURISDICTION. IT REASONS THAT CRIMINAL LAW CAN PLAUSIBLY BE JUSTIFIED AS A COOPERATIVE INSTITUTION THAT ACHIEVES THE PUBLIC GOOD OF A RULE OF LAW, WITH ITS ATTENDANT BENEFITS OF SOCIAL PEACE AND EQUAL DIGNITY OF PERSONS. IT THEN ARGUES THAT SUCH A BENEFICIAL RULE OF LAW REQUIRES A PUNISHING AUTHORITY WITH THE EXECUTIVE CAPACITY TO PROTECT THOSE IT CLAIMS TO REGULATE. IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT CRIMINAL PROHIBITIONS MAY NOT BE JUSTIFIABLE IF THEY CANNOT BE ENFORCED SYSTEMATICALLY. BECAUSE THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM GENERALLY LACKS THE EXECUTIVE CAPACITY REQUIRED FOR A RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT IS JUSTIFIABLE AS SUPPORTIVE OF A RULE OF LAW ONLY IN RARE CIRCUMSTANCES. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER AN ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSIVE RATIONALE CAN, NEVERTHELESS, JUSTIFY OCCASIONAL PROSECUTIONS AS USEFUL IN LEGITIMIZING INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN NORMS. IT QUESTIONS WHETHER THE EXPRESSIVE BENEFITS OF SUCH PROSECUTIONS CAN OUTWEIGH THE EXPRESSIVE RISKS OF PROMISING PROTECTION THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM CANNOT DELIVER.
728	THE THEME OF THE BOOK SYMPOSIUM 'THE RULE OF LAW IN TRANSNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS' IS, AS BHATT'S CONCESSIONAIRES, FINANCIERS AND COMMUNITIES (2020) AND LANDER'S TRANSNATIONAL LAW AND STATE TRANSFORMATION (2020) HIGHLIGHT, RIPE FOR CRITICAL REFLECTION. THE TWO BOOKS REVEAL THE POWER WIELDED BY PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT ACTORS IN THE CO-CONSTITUTION OF LEGAL NORMS, OFTEN AT THE EXPENSE OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPMENT-INVESTMENT SETTINGS. THE CO-CONSTITUTION OF LEGAL NORMS BY PRIVATE ACTORS VIA 'CONTRACTS', 'POLICIES' AND 'INTERMEDIARIES' (BHATT, LANDER AND TAEKEMA, BOOK SYMPOSIUM INTRODUCTION IN THIS ISSUE) DEVELOPMENT PERMEATES RULE OF LAW IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, INCLUDING IN WAYS THAT AFFECT THE APPLICATION OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS. OF COURSE, RULE OF LAW MAY BE DEFINED BY 'THICK' CONCEPTIONS HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS AS A JUST SYSTEM OF LAWS 'CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND STANDARDS' (UN SECRETARY GENERAL, 2004, PARA. 6) OR 'THIN' CONCEPTIONS WITH MORE FORMALISTIC REQUIREMENTS THAT DO NOT PRESCRIBE POLITICAL OR SOCIAL VALUES. DEONTOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ASIDE, EVEN IN ITS 'THINNEST' CONCEPTION, RULE OF LAW MEANS THAT LEGAL NORMS 'SHOULD BE PUBLICLY PROMULGATED; BE PREDICTABLE IN THEIR APPLICATION; APPLY TO ALL CITIZENS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS; AND BE SUBJECT TO SOME FORM OF NEUTRAL ADJUDICATION IN THE EVENT OF DISPUTES AS TO THEIR INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION' (TREBILCOCK, 2011, P. 209). YET, RULE OF LAW HAS OFTEN BEEN APPLIED 'TO FAVOUR ENTRENCHED ELITES OVER RESISTANCE GROUPS, VESTED INTERESTS HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS OVER CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, OFFICIAL ACTORS OVER UNOFFICIAL ACTORS AND PROPERTY OWNERS OVER PROTESTORS' (SIMPSON, 2012, P. 9).
729	THE RECENT INTRODUCTION OF THE "DONATION-BASED LEGAL PERSONALITY" CLASSIFICATION IS A MILESTONE IN THE ONGOING PROCESS OF PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGULATION OF RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA. ITS IMPLEMENTATION, HOWEVER, MAY BE CONFRONTED BY BOTH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL OBSTACLES. BASED ON JUDICIAL REVIEW AND FINDINGS OF RESEARCH FIELDWORK CONDUCTED IN SOME OF THE MAJOR BUDDHIST TEMPLES IN CHINA, THIS STUDY DISCUSSES THE JUDICIAL, SOCIAL AND PRACTICAL DILEMMAS OF CONFERRING DONATION-BASED LEGAL PERSONALITY ON BUDDHIST TEMPLES. IT REVEALS THAT THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE LAND AND PROPERTY OWNERSHIP OF BUDDHIST TEMPLES ARE COMPLEX AND THAT THE UNIQUE TRADITIONAL INTERNAL ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE OF BUDDHIST TEMPLES HAS POSED CHALLENGES TO CONFERRING DONATION-BASED LEGAL PERSONALITY UPON THEM.
730	IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP AND LINKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND TAX COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOUR ACROSS TAXPAYERS IN EAST MALAYSIA OTHERWISE KNOWN AS BORNEO. THE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING OF PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES. FOUR PROXIES OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY WERE EXAMINED IN THE STUDY, NAMELY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (VA), POLITICAL STABILITY (PS), GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (GE), AND RULE OF LAW (RL). RESULTS INDICATE THAT ONLY POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE TAX COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOUR POSITIVELY, WHILE THE OTHER TWO PROXIES OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS SHOWED OTHERWISE WITH INSIGNIFICANT FINDINGS. THE CURRENT FINDING SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAINTAIN STABILITY IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND PROMOTE A STRINGENT WITH THE EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW TO ENCOURAGE SUBSTANTIAL PARTICIPATION IN TAX COMPLIANCE BEHAVIOUR.
731	PLATO'S REPUBLIC AND LAWS ARE CONVENTIONALLY UNDERSTOOD TO OFFER RIVAL AND INCOMPATIBLE VIEWS OF THE BEST POLITICAL REGIME, WITH THE FERMER CHAMPIONING THE A-LEGAL RULE OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE LATTER THE RULE OF LAW. AGAINST THIS VIEW, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS FIRST THAT LAW IS IN NO SENSE ABSENT FROM THE REPUBLIC, AND SECOND THAT THE RULE OF LAW ADVOCATED IN THE LAWS IS ESTABLISHED ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES USED TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF PHILOSOPHERS IN THE REPUBLIC. THUS THE TWO DIALOGUES DO NOT OPPOSE EACH OTHER, BUT CONSTITUTE TWO STAGES IN A LARGER INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF POLITICS LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RULE OF PHILOSOPHY NOR TO THE RULE OF LAW SIMPLY, BUT TO THE GOOD ITSELF AS THE RULE AND MEASURE OF BOTH.
732	HOW DO DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ORDER IN WAYS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO GROWTH? CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARSHIP ASSOCIATES ORDER, DEMOCRACY, AND GROWTH WITH CENTRALIZED RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE TEST THE ROBUSTNESS OF MODERN ASSUMPTIONS BY TURNING TO THE CASE OF ANCIENT ATHENS. DEMOCRATIC ATHENS WAS REMARKABLY STABLE AND PROSPEROUS, BUT THE ANCIENT CITY-STATE NEVER DEVELOPED EXTENSIVELY CENTRALIZED RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS. DRAWING ON THE "WHAT-IS-LAW" ACCOUNT OF LEGAL ORDER ELABORATED BY HADFIELD AND WEINGAST (2012), WE SHOW THAT ATHENS' LEGAL ORDER RELIED ON INSTITUTIONS THAT ACHIEVED COMMON KNOWLEDGE AND INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY FOR ENFORCERS IN A LARGELY DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF COERCION. OUR APPROACH PROVIDES FRESH INSIGHTS INTO HOW ROBUST LEGAL ORDERS MAY BE BUILT IN COUNTRIES WHERE CENTRALIZED RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS HAVE FAILED TO TAKE ROOT.
733	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS THAT MEXICAN CITIZENS FACE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE PUBLIC INSECURITY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE MAIN ISSUE IS THE ABSENCE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN PUBLIC SECURITY APPARATUS AND THE JUDICIARY IN MEXICO RESTRICTS BOTH THE GOVERNMENTS' AS WELL AS THE CITIZENS' ABILITY TO REDUCE INSECURITY AND VIOLENCE. THIS IN TURN CONTRIBUTES TO A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY AND THE ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHOR ANALYSES CURRENT SITUATION OF INSECURITY AND VIOLENCE AND THE INADEQUACY OF SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS, RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO RULE OF LAW. BY COMPARING VARIOUS INDICES AND INDICATORS ABOUT DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW CITIZENS' VISION TO THE PROBLEM AND PROVIDES AN AGENDA FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
734	THIS STUDY FRAMES THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS CONSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AGREED IN THE AMERICAN CONVENTION OF SAN JOSE'S PACT. OUR ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE PROTECTION OF POLITICAL RIGHTS STATED BY VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA AND ECUADOR IN THEIR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ENSURE THE PARTICIPATION OF CHARACTERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW STATE. THE CONDITION TO INCREASE THE LEVELS OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE THE CORRECT APPLICATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RISKS OF DELEGATIVE DEMOCRACIES IN NICARAGUA, VENEZUELA AND ECUADOR, WERE DEFINED IN THIS DOCUMENT THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF DEFINITIONS AND TYPOLOGIES OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS.
735	"[I]N ORDER TO FULLY ABOLISH THE OPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS PRODUCED BY SLAVERY, NEW DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE CREATED ..." - W.E.B. DUBOIS THIS ARTICLE WILL BRING TOGETHER, IN A NOVEL WAY, THREE CRITICAL THEMES OR CONCEPTS-SETTLER COLONIALISM, IMMIGRATION PLENARY POWER, AND RULE OF LAW. THE U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY HAS NATURALIZED RACIALIZED SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRATIFICATION AND SUBORDINATION. PLENARY POWER, A COURTMADE DOCTRINE FOUNDED UPON SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONALISM, IS ONE OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DARK, ANTI-DEMOCRATIC UNDERCURRENTS OF OPPRESSION. THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT, THE CONTEMPORARY BAN ON MIGRATION OF PERSONS FROM MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES, AND THE CAGING OF ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE JUSTIFIED AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN RULE OF LAW, SANCTIONED BY THE JUDICIARY VIA PLENARY POWER. PLENARY POWER'S LEGITIMACY IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN FACT, IT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS LAWLESS BECAUSE IT HAS REPRESENTED A POLITICIZED EXCUSE BY THE JUDICIARY TO DECLINE JURISDICTION, OR TO PROVIDE LOWER LEVELS OF SCRUTINY TO ACTS OF CONGRESS LIMITING THE RIGHTS OF PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS. WHILE IMMIGRATION PLENARY POWER HAS BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED BY IMMIGRATION SCHOLARS, NONE HAVE CONSIDERED IT THROUGH THE LENS OF SETTLER COLONIALISM IN CONJUNCTION WITH A THEORY OF RULE OF LAW TO ADDRESS THE WAYS IN WHICH IT UNDERMINES RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE WILL DIRECTLY TAKE ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER RULE OF LAW CAN FACILITATE CHALLENGING THE RACIALIZING AND SUBORDINATING FUNCTION OF IMMIGRATION PLENARY POWER. ULTIMATELY, THE PLENARY POWER DOCTRINE MAY HELP DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PROBLEM WITH "RULE OF LAW" MAY NOT BE THAT IT MEANS TOO MANY THINGS TO TOO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT THAT IT MEANS ONE THING, PREDETERMINED BY THE HISTORY OF THE SETTLER COLONIAL PROJECT.
736	THE UKRAINIAN STATE, LIKE ANY STATE THAT SEEKS TO ASSERT ITSELF IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND ENSURE THE PROPER STANDARD OF LIVING OF THE POPULATION, HAS THROUGHOUT ITS EXISTENCE PAID AND CURRENTLY PAYS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. THE VERY STATE OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS AN INDICATOR OF THE STATE'S INTEREST IN OBSERVING THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF A PERSON, WHICH IN TURN IS THE BASIS FOR RECOGNIZING SUCH A STATE AS A LEGAL STATE, I.E. ONE WHERE THE LAWS THAT ESTABLISH THE BASIC RIGHTS OF A PERSON AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR NONCOMPLIANCE BOTH FOR ANOTHER PERSON AND FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE. THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL STATE IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF ALL INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN IT, IN PARTICULAR, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, THEREFORE, A SPECIAL PLACE AMONG THE ISSUES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS OCCUPIED BY THE ISSUE OF JUSTICE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT, IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH THE TOPIC OF THE MENTIONED STUDY IS EXTREMELY RELEVANT. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE STATE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IN THE OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IN UKRAINE. THE AUTHORS USED DIALECTICAL, FORMAL-LEGAL, AXIOLOGICAL, LOGICAL-LEGAL, HERMENEUTIC METHODS, AS WELL AS THE METHOD OF CONTENT ANALYSIS, GENERALIZATION, MODELING, COMPARISON, ANALOGY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL SELFGOVERNMENT. THESE SHORTCOMINGS INCLUDE THE POLITICIZATION OF THE JUDICIARY, THE LACK OF COMPETENCE OF JUDGES, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.
737	THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE ENFORCEMENT AND VALIDITY OF THE BRAZILIAN NATIONAL SECURITY LAW (FEDERAL LAW NO. 7.170/1983) IN THE 2020S, CONSIDERING THAT SUCH ACT WAS CREATED AT THE END OF THE BRAZILIAN MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO. THIS WORK RAISES THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SUCH A FACT IS POSSIBLE WITHIN A CONTEXT OF A LOW-LEVEL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESS, MARKED BY THE OBLIVION OF THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED DURING THE AUTOCRATIC PERIOD AND WHICH DID NOT CARRY OUT THE INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS NECESSARY TO PURGE ALL DICTATORIAL LAWS. FROM A METHODOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, THIS ARTICLE USES HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE AND THE LITERATURE REVIEW IS FOCUSED ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE FROM THE AREAS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, POLITICAL SCIENCE AND HISTORY. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION ON THE SUBJECT IS ALSO ANALYZED, AS WELL AS NEWS FROM NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISTIC SITES.
738	IN THIS PAPER, WE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZE DECISIONS MADE BY THE PERUVIAN CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL FROM 1996 TO 2006 IN AMPARO CASES, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. WE ASK THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: IN THESE TYPES OF CASES, WHAT CONDITIONS LED THE TRIBUNAL TO ASSERT ITSELF AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE? THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF TRIBUNAL DECISIONS DURING THE PRESIDENCIES OF ALBERTO FUJIMORI AND ALEJANDRO TOLEDO, WE FIND THAT THE TRIBUNAL IS MORE LIKELY TO RULE AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE, AS THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE EXECUTIVE DECREASES AND AS THE SHARE OF CONGRESSIONAL SEATS OF THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY DECLINES. FURTHER, THE TRIBUNAL IS MORE WILLING TO DECIDE CASES AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE IN AREAS THAT MOST PERVADE ITS DOCKET, SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREAS OF PENSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT. THESE FINDINGS ADD TO THE COMPARATIVE AND AMERICAN JUDICIAL POLITICS LITERATURE BY SHOWING THAT HIGH COURTS, EVEN RELATIVELY WEAK ONES, FOLLOW POLITICS, BUT THAT CASE SUBJECT AREA AND PREVALENCE MAY TEMPER THIS TENDENCY.
739	WE ARE LIVING IN TIMES OF CHANGE, TURBULENCE AND TRANSITION. THE OVERALL PHENOMENON DESCRIBING THE CONCEPTUAL CONSTITUTIONAL OUTLOOK OF THE LAST DECADES (OR AT LEAST THE PERIOD FROM 2009 ONWARDS) CAN BE DEFINED AS CONSTITUTIONAL POLYCRISIS. CONSTITUTIONAL POLYCRISIS RESULTS FROM A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS WHICH THIS WRITER HAS DEFINED ELSEWHERE AS THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL REASONS FOR ITS EMERGENCE, UNFOLDING AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS ARTICLE IS A CONTINUATION OF THE WRITER'S PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON CONSTITUTIONAL POLYCRISIS, TRANSITORY CONSTITUTIONALISM AND EMERGENCY CONSTITUTIONALISM. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO THREE CONCEPTUAL CRISES THAT SERVE AS GENERAL PRECONDITIONS AND DETERMINANTS AND THUS AS THE FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLYCRISIS. THESE ARE THE CRISIS OF HIERARCHY, THE CRISIS OF TERRITORIALITY AND SPATIALITY AND THE CRISIS OF THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIVIDE. HISTORICALLY, HIERARCHY, THE TERRITORIALITY OF POWER AND THE CLEAR PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIVIDE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FACTORS MARKING ENTRY INTO THE PHASE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNITY. THEIR CURRENT CRISIS PROMOTES A TRANSITION TO A NEW STAGE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CIVILISATION CHARACTERISED BY POST-TERRITORIAL AND ATERRITORIAL FORMS OF POWER, SEPARATION OF POWER FROM ITS TERRITORIAL CONSTRAINTS SO THAT TERRITORY IS NO LONGER THE NECESSARY PRECONDITION OF POWER, AND THE EMERGENCE OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND SOCIETAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AS PHENOMENA GOING BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL RESTRAINTS OF MODERN HIERARCHICAL AND TERRITORIALLY-BASED CONSTITUTIONALISM. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO OUTLINE WHAT MAY CONSTITUTE THE "NEW NORMAL" AND HOW CAN WE DEFINE NORMALITY IN TIMES OF MULTITUDE CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSITIONS AND EMERGENCY CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE DEGREE OF PERMISSIBLE CONFLICT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND PREVENTS CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLOSION. IT ALSO ATTEMPTS TO CONSIDER WHAT THE CORE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IS IN TIMES OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLYCRISIS.
740	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ESTABLISH IF THE CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRATIC MODEL IS GUIDED AND BASED ON SPREADING FEAR AND TERROR TO EXTERMINATE THE "ENEMY." TO DO THIS, THE FIRST THING IS TO NOTE THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF GUIDED DEMOCRACY AND REVERTED TERRORISM BOTH SPENT LEGALLY AND SOCIOLOGICALLY. THEN DIFFERENTIATING ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY AS "NATIONAL SECURITY" WERE IDENTIFIED AS WELL AS THE DISRUPTIVE, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL METHODS, AND, FINALLY, THE USE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW OF THE ENEMY. WITH THESE ELEMENTS, IT WILL BE DEFINED IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO AFFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF GUIDED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTORS AND CRITERIA DESCRIBED ABOVE.
741	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES AND ANALYSES THE AUTHORITARIAN DIMENSION OF JUDICIAL IDEOLOGY OF THE SLOVENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. IT IS BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH MEASURING THE PRESENCE OF JUDICIAL IDEOLOGY AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SLOVENIA IN THE SELECTED PERIODS OF 1993-1997, 2002-2006, AND 2011-2016 WITHIN THE FIRST THREE EIGHT-YEAR MANDATES. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW AUTHORITARIAN THE SLOVENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS BEEN IN ITS JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING DURING THE MENTIONED YEARS. OUR RESEARCH ILLUSTRATES THAT ALL THREE MANDATES OF THE SLOVENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHOW A PREFERENCE FOR A CENTRAL IDEOLOGICAL POSITION WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTHORITARIAN DIMENSION OF JUDICIAL IDEOLOGY AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE DESCRIBED AS AUTHORITARIAN IN THEIR DECISION-MAKING.
742	THERE IS A TENDENCY IN CONTEMPORARY CONTRACT LAW FOR JUDGES TO "NEVER SAY NEVER" AND PERMIT AN OPEN-ENDED EXCEPTION FROM THE RULE. THIS NEBULOUS EXCEPTION IS DESIGNED TO CATER FOR THE RARE INSTANCE WHERE APPLICATION OF THE RULE WOULD BE UNDESIRABLE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE. HOWEVER, THIS KIND OF IMPRECISE EXCEPTION IS DELETERIOUS IN TERMS OF THE UNPREDICTABILITY IT GENERATES, AS WELL AS THE ATTENDANT INCREASES IN TIME AND COSTS THAT RESULT. THE " NEVER SAY NEVER" APPROACH IS TO BE DISCOURAGED IN CONTRACT LAW WHERE COMMERCIAL PREDICTABILITY, WHILE CERTAINLY NOT INVIOLABLE, NONETHELESS REMAINS A WEIGHTY GOAL DESERVING OF CONTINUED DEFERENCE.
743	ALTHOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND EQUITY RETURNS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE LITERATURE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA (MENA) EQUITY MARKETS WERE USUALLY EXCLUDED. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO FILL IN THIS GAP BY EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX AND EQUITY MARKET RETURNS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR A NUMBER OF CONTROL VARIABLES. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON EQUITY MARKET RETURNS, WHICH ARE NOT EXPLAINED BY BUSINESS-CYCLE CONTROL VARIABLES RELATED TO EXPECTED RETURNS, AND THAT LEGAL STRUCTURE AND SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.

744	FOR IMPERIAL BRITAIN, IT HAS OFTEN BEEN STATED, THE INTRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW WAS A CARDINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND INDEED THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT OF EMPIRE. BUT THIS IS A VIEW THAT HAS ALSO BEEN STRONGLY CHALLENGED. FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT OFTEN AT TIMES OF CRISIS, MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW COLLIDED WITH THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COLONIAL STATE TO SECURE SOCIAL ORDER, WITH THE STATE THEN TURNING TO EMERGENCY MEASURES, FORSAKING THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL PROCESS. IN THE EARLY 1930S, THE COLONIAL STATE IN BURMA FACED A MAJOR REBELLION, AND INDEED EMERGENCY MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED TO TRY THE LARGE NUMBER OF REBELS CAPTURED. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE, DRAWING ON A SUBSTANTIAL COLLECTION OF FILES CREATED BY THE TRIALS AND THE APPEALS THAT AROSE FROM THEM, ARGUES THAT, WITHIN THAT EMERGENCY REGIME, LONG-ESTABLISHED LEGAL PROCESSES WERE RETAINED TO A STRIKING DEGREE. IN FACT, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES, AT A TIME OF SEVERE CHALLENGE TO THE COLONIAL ORDER, MAINTAINING THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL PROCESS BECAME STILL MORE CRITICAL IN THE COLONIAL MIND, FOR WERE IT TO BE FORSAKEN, THOSE CHARGED WITH RUNNING THE COLONIAL STATE WOULD BE FORCED TO QUESTION ITS - AND THEIR - VERY PURPOSE.
745	THIS ARTICLE, BASED ON A RESEARCH PROJECT, STUDIES THE NEW NOTION OF THE FAMILY INSTITUTION ARISEN WITH THE EXPEDITION OF THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION IN 1991 SINCE IT RECOGNIZED AND PONDERED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FAMILY IN THE COLOMBIAN STATE'S STRUCTURE AS BEING THE MAIN NUCLEUS OF SOCIETY. LIKEWISE, DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S RULINGS REGARDING THIS MATTER ARE ANALYZED, ESPECIALLY, THOSE PROJECTING SOCIAL REALITY OF INHABITANTS, PRIMARILY, THE FAMILIES DWELLING IN LA PAZ NEIGHBORHOOD IN BARRANQUILLA.
746	USUALLY THE PRESENT-DAY UNDERSTANDING OF AFRICA DOESN'T LOOK BACK BEYOND ITS COLONIAL PAST. BUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF AFRICAN NATION STATES WITH THE WESTERN SYSTEM OF A STRONG AND ACCOUNTABLE STATE AND AN OPEN CIVIL SOCIETY HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PRECOLONIAL SYSTEM OF IN-GROUP SOLIDARITY AND VERTICAL NETWORKS UNDER PATERNALISTIC AUTHORITY. THE WESTERN POLITICAL ORDER DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE OF BEING ADOPTED IF THE TRADITIONS OF SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND PERSONALIZED RELATIONSHIPS CANNOT BE INTEGRATED INTO IT. THIS NEED COMES IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT BY THE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE IMPERSONAL AND FUNCTIONALIZED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF NEOLIBERALISM IN THE WEST ITSELF, WHICH INCREASINGLY EVOKES NEO-TRIBAL REACTIONS IN SEARCH FOR NEW IN-GROUP SOLIDARITY AND IDENTITY. WHILE AFRICA IS GRAPPLING TO ADOPT THE WESTERN SYSTEM, WESTERN SOCIETIES RETURN TO THE TRIBAL HERITAGE, IT SEEMS. THIS ESSAY MAKES A PLEA TO LOCATE THE NEED AND DESIRE FOR BELONGINGNESS IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES. THEY CULTIVATE STRONG BONDS OF SOLIDARITY AND COOPERATIVE NETWORKS. THEIR TEMPORARY EXISTENCE AND FAST RHYTHMS OF CHANGE PREVENT THEM FROM SLIPPING OFF INTO THE OLD EXCLUSION MECHANISM OF THE TRIBAL EXISTENCE, WHICH IS SO DANGEROUS IN POLITICS. BOTH WESTERN AND AFRICAN SOCIETIES MAY FIND A NEW FUTURE BY LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER'S PAST.
747	AN EXPANDING LITERATURE ASSERTS THAT NON-US FIRMS ACHIEVE A UNIQUE VALUATION PREMIUM FOR LISTING ON US EQUITY MARKETS. IN THIS PAPER WE TEST THE UNIQUENESS OF THE US FOREIGN LISTING PREMIUM BY EXAMINING THE PREMIUM ACHIEVED BY FOREIGN LISTINGS ACROSS A GLOBAL SET OF STOCK EXCHANGES. WE HIGHLIGHT THAT THE DOCUMENTED VALUATION PREMIUM FOR LISTING ON US EXCHANGES IS NOT UNIQUE BUT COMMON TO MANY HOME AND HOST MARKETS INCLUDING US FIRMS THAT LIST ABROAD. THE CROSS-SECTIONAL VARIATION IN THE VALUATION PREMIUM APPEARS TO HAVE LITTLE ASSOCIATION WITH SUCH CROSS-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES AS INVESTOR PROTECTION RULES, LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE, OR ACCOUNTING DISCLOSURE STANDARDS. RATHER THE PREMIUM APPEARS MOST RELATED TO VARIATION IN PRE-LISTING VALUATION RATIOS. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
748	JEFFREY GOLDSWORTHY'S BOOK, PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY: CONTEMPORARY DEBATES, OFFERS A MODERN DEFENCE OF THE DOCTRINE OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY. BUT IT FAILS TO OFFER A SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR INTERPRETATION OF THE STATEMENT THAT PARLIAMENT CAN DO ANYTHING EXCEPT LIMIT ITS POWERS, A STATEMENT OPEN TO MANY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS. IN 1972, DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES BILL, LAW OFFICERS DECLARED THAT IT WAS LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR PARLIAMENT TO ABRIDGE ITS SOVEREIGNTY. IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ACT 1972, THE DOCTRINE HAS UNDERGONE A SUBTLE ALTERATION OF MEANING. THE EUROPEAN UNION ACT 2011 ALSO POSES PROBLEMS FOR GOLDSWORTHY'S POSITION SINCE IT IMPOSES A REFERENDUM REQUIREMENT ON ANY SIGNIFICANT FUTURE TRANSFER OF POWER TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. SUCH LEGISLATION CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE MANNER AND FORM INTERPRETATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY; AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE COURTS CAN DISAPPLY LEGISLATION INFRINGING HUMAN RIGHTS REMAINS OPEN. QUESTIONS OF THE SORT, 'CAN PARLIAMENT DO X?', ARE BETTER REPLACED BY QUESTIONS OF THE SORT 'WHAT ARE THE RULES WHICH REGULATE PARLIAMENT?'. GOLDSWORTHY'S WORK CONSTITUTES A BRAVE ATTEMPT TO RESCUE THE ESSENTIALLY METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINE OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY. NEVERTHELESS, THE DOCTRINE SEEMS TO OBSCURE RATHER THAN CLARIFY CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES.
749	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE PHENOMENA OF THE JUDICIALISATION OF POLITICS AND THE CITIZENISATION OF THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN LATIN AMERICA IN RECENT YEARS. THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY PRESENTING A DEFINITION OF THESE PHENOMENA, AFTER WHICH THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THE PHENOMENA THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT AREAS: THE CHANGES IN CIVIL SOCIETY THAT HAVE LED TO A DISCOVERY OF LAW AND THE LANGUAGE OF LAW; INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND SPECIFICALLY THE REFORMS OF JUDICIAL POWER IN RECENT YEARS, AND THE CHANGES IN THE LEGITIMISATION DISCOURSE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AROUND THE CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND CITIZENSHIP OF RIGHTS.
750	STUDYING THE INDEPENDENCE OF JORDAN'S JUDICIARY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR APPRECIATING CURRENT STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC REFORM. IN THIS ARTICLE, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS CRITICALLY EXPLORED THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF JORDAN'S LEGAL SYSTEM, ITS POLITICAL CULTURE AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL POLICY INITIATIVES. A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS ARE ADVANCED IN A BID TO ENCOURAGE ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT THE CENTRAL ROLE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY MUST PLAY IN ADVANCING THE INTERESTS OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN FUTURE REFORM EFFORTS WHETHER IN JORDAN OR THE WIDER ARAB REGION.
751	THIS PAPER ADVANCES A FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE UK CONSTITUTION. IT EXPLORES HOW THE UK CONSTITUTION DISCHARGES THREE MINIMUM 'CONSTITUTING', 'LEGITIMATING' AND 'LIMITING' FUNCTIONS THAT CITIZENS LIVING IN MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES MAY LEGITIMATELY EXPECT ALL CONSTITUTIONS - IRRESPECTIVE OF FORM - TO PERFORM. THIS FUNCTIONAL ENQUIRY BREAKS WITH DOMINANT TRENDS IN THE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT REMAIN FOCUSED ON THEORISING THE CONSTITUTION'S UNDERLYING POLITICAL OR LEGAL NATURE OR, LIKEWISE, IDENTIFYING ITS ULTIMATE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY. IN ADDITION TO OFFERING A RICHER DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE, THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES, NORMATIVELY, AN INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PARLIAMENT TO DISCHARGE THE UK CONSTITUTION'S THREE MINIMUM FUNCTIONS. RECOGNISING THAT INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY UNLOCKS FRESH INSIGHTS INTO TWO CONSTITUTIONAL CONUNDRUMS: THE LEGITIMACY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THE STATUS OF 'CONSTITUTIONAL STATUTES'. AT THE SAME TIME, IT ALSO EXPOSES DEFICIENCIES AND TENSIONS IN RELATION TO THE QUALITY OF PARLIAMENT'S INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON MATTERS OF MINIMUM CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONING.
752	DURING THE LAST YEARS, THE LGBT (LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER AND INTERSEX) POPULATION HAS BECOME A PROTAGONIST ON THE COUNTRY'S AND THE CONTINENT'S PUBLIC SPHERE. BY MEANS OF SOCIAL MOBILITY, THE LGBT MOVEMENT HAS ACHIEVED THE RECOGNITION OF ITS RIGHTS WITH THE CREATION OF LAWS. THIS ARTICLE WILL GO OVER THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND MOBILIZATIONS DONE THROUGHOUT THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS OVER THE CAMPAIGNS ORIENTED TOWARDS THE FORMATION OF CITIZENSHIP, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT AIM TO REINFORCE RESPECT AND ACKNOWLEDGE DIVERSITY AS TOP-NOTCH VALUES IN SOCIETY.
753	WITH PROMINENCE OF THE TYPICAL FEATURES OF DIGITAL ERA, PARTICULARLY THAT PEOPLE'S ACTIVITIES AND SOCIAL LIVES ARE BECOMING MORE DIGITALIZED, AND HUMANS HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW DIGITAL IDENTITY, THE PRESENTATION AND REGULATION OF DIGITAL IDENTITY BECOMES AN EMERGING THEME. BASED ON THESE FEATURES OF DIGITAL ERA, A SLEW OF CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN, INCLUDING THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY, PREVENTING ALGORITHMIC BIAS, AND BALANCING THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC ACQUISITION AND DATA CONTROLLED BY A FEW. CONSEQUENTLY, PROTECTING DIGITAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE EMBEDDED IN PUBLIC POLICIES, TO BETTER BALANCE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS AMONG VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. ESTABLISHING DUAL PROTECTION MECHANISMS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW IS THEREFORE FITTING AND PROPER, AND THE FUTURE LEGISLATION MAY TARGET THE SCENARIO-BASED PROTECTION OF PERSONAL RIGHTS.
754	THIS PAPER PROPOSES A METHOD FOR MEASURING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS A MEANS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GLOBAL GOAL 16 OF THE UNITED NATIONS AGENDA. THIS METHOD IS THE PRIMARY ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY THE QUALITY OF THE RULES OF THE JUDICIARY AND ACCESS TO A COURT IN ORDER TO MONITOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA OF JUSTICE. IN THE RECENT YEARS, THE U.N. DREW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT QUALITATIVE CHANGES SHOULD BE EVALUATED THROUGH QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS. THE AUTHORS' METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON THE FAIR TRIAL STANDARD FORMULATED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS BASED ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC SERVICES STANDARD OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THIS INDEXING METHOD HELPS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT LEVEL OF LEGAL GUARANTEES IN THE RULES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND DRAFT LEGISLATION, AND TO ESTABLISH THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FAIR TRIAL PRINCIPLES. INDEXING THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE HAS ANOTHER POSITIVE EFFECT - IT HELPS TO MONITOR THE LOCAL SITUATIONS AND EVERY LEVEL OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. PUTTING THIS METHOD INTO PRACTICE WILL ENCOURAGE AVOIDANCE OF THE ADOPTION OF BILLS THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE LEVEL OF LEGAL GUARANTEES AND WILL ASSIST ATTEMPTS TO MONITOR ITS DYNAMICS. IT COULD PROMOTE THE INTRODUCTION OF EFFECTIVE PROCEDURES AND BETTER ACCESS TO COURT, ENSURE THE IMPROVED ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALL PUBLIC JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS AT ALL LEVELS AND SUPPORT OVERALL SOCIETAL WELLBEING.
755	THE INSTITUTIONS IMPROVEMENT IS ONE OF PRINCIPAL CONDITIONS FOR THE TRANSITIONAL AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES GROWTH. THIS STUDY ON THE BASES OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH INVESTIGATES THE NECESSITY OF USING THE CONCEPT "INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY" IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCHING, PROVES THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AS A RESULT OF IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF ECONOMIC AGENTS ROOTING IN ECONOMIC AGENTS' MENTALITY. THE INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY IS AN OBLIGATORY ATTRIBUTE OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, BECAUSE INSTITUTIONS HAVE CAPABILITY TO GENERATE NOT ONLY "CERTAINTY" BUT ALSO "UNCERTAINTY" AND "RISKS" FOR ECONOMIC AGENTS. THE INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS KNIGHTIAN UNCERTAINTY REFLECT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF CHANGES OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND BASIC INSTITUTIONS (ETHIC, ETHNIC, CULTURAL, IDEOLOGY, POLITICAL, BUSINESS AND SO ON), AND THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF IT INFLUENCES ON ECONOMIC AGENTS' BEHAVIOR. IN THIS CONNECTION IT NEEDS TO SPECIFY THE INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY FROM POLITICAL RISKS AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY. LEADING REASONS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY ARE PRESENTED ON THE MICRO-LEVEL AT PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS WIDESPREAD IN MARKET AND IN PRE-MARKET ECONOMIES. ON THE MACRO-LEVEL THE CONCEPT OF INSTITUTIONAL UNCERTAINTY IS REFLECTING NOT ONLY UNPREDICTABILITY OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, BUT ALSO UNIQUENESS OF COMBINATIONS OF DRIVING FORCES OF TRANSITION TO NEW FRAMES OF ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. SOME DIRECTIONS OF USING THIS CONCEPT AT INVESTIGATION OF HISTORIC INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN MODERN TRANSITIONAL AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES ARE CONSIDERED IN THE LAST PARTS OF THE STUDY.
756	CENTRAL AMERICA'S NORTHERN TRIANGLE IS INFAMOUS FOR HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENT CRIME AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, PRODUCING "IMPUNITY STATES" IN WHICH VIOLENCE TYPICALLY GOES UNPUNISHED. THAT VIOLENCE REFLECTS THE BROADER IMPUNITY OR "TRANSITIONAL INJUSTICE" THAT HAS PERSISTED SINCE THE PEACE ACCORDS AND TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY OF THE 1980S AND 1990S. SEVERAL "POSTTRANSITIONAL" TRIALS FOR PAST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN RECENT YEARS IN GUATEMALA WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING EFFORTS IN THE PROSECUTORIAL AGENCY, LED BY A UNIQUE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS AWAY FROM BROAD IMPUNITY MAY ALSO BE SEEN IN THE 2015 "GUATEMALAN SPRING," IN WHICH A SITTING PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO RESIGN AND SUBMIT TO PROSECUTION IN CONNECTION WITH A CORRUPTION SCANDAL. COMPARISONS OF GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR, AND HONDURAS SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING IS NECESSARY BEFORE "POSTTRANSITIONAL JUSTICE," OR AN END TO IMPUNITY MORE GENERALLY, CAN BE POSSIBLE.
757	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF EU MEMBER STATE CULTURE ON THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE UNION FROM A CONSTRUCTIVIST PERSPECTIVE. IT ASCERTAINS THAT THE PRESENT DISINTEGRATION IS A RESULT OF A LONG-TIME EXISTING EUROPE-WIDE ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION DESCRIBED BY ZEEV STERNHELL. ITS PATTERNS WERE ALWAYS PART OF EU LAW AS WELL AS DOMESTIC POLICY-MAKING; ONLY ITS STRENGTH AND RELEVANCE WERE DIFFERENT. AS A RESULT, EU POLICIES EXISTED LIKE MATERIALS IN A DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM: ANTAGONISTIC PROCESSES LIKE INTEGRATION AND DISINTEGRATION WERE MELDING IN EU COOPERATION, AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE SAME SYSTEM. WITHOUT PROPER CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER, THE SYSTEM CAN CONTAIN MORE AND MORE PATTERNS WHICH REVERSE COOPERATION AND CAUSE TENSIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ANTI-ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGATE THE COOPERATION, BUT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE AND, THROUGH THIS, THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH EUROPEAN NATIONS BUILD THEIR COOPERATION.
758	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE KEY VALUES THAT WE ARGUE SHOULD UNDERPIN AN INDEX OF THE LEGITIMACY OF THE GOVERNANCE OF ONLINE INTERMEDIARIES. THE AIM IS ULTIMATELY TO ALLOW SCHOLARS TO RANK THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF INTERMEDIARIES AGAINST CORE HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE IN A WAY THAT ENABLES COMPARISON ACROSS DIFFERENT INTERMEDIARIES AND OVER TIME. THIS WORK BUILDS ON THE EFFORTS OF A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCHERS ALREADY WORKING TO SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATE THE GOVERNANCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERMEDIARIES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT OUR REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT TO DATE, USING THE DIGITAL CONSTITUTIONALISM LITERATURE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION.
759	THIS REFLECTION ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE THE GENERAL PENSION SYSTEM IN COLOMBIA, EMPHASIZING THE CURRENT SITUATION OF WORKERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, GIVEN THAT POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THEIR LABOR RIGHTS ARE PRESUMED, WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY ENSHRINED IN THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION, THE RIGHT TO SOCIAL SECURITY IN PENSION. FOR ITS PART, ALTHOUGH THE MAGNA CARTA MAKES REFERENCE IN ARTICLE 48 TO SECURITY AS AN INALIENABLE RIGHT, IT STATES IT IN A GENERAL WAY, BUT IN THE CASE OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS, THE LEGAL CONTENT LACKS SPECIFICATION, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IGNORANCE OF ITS RIGHTS AS THEIR WORK IS NOT CONFIGURED WITHIN THE FORMALITIES OF A CONTRACT. THE APPROACH IS QUALITATIVE INDUCTIVE, WHICH ALLOWS TO KNOW MORE IN DEPTH THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE PHENOMENON. LIKEWISE, THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS WILL BE HERMENEUTIC AS IT ALLOWS THE INTERPRETATION OF BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN RELATION TO THE RIGHT TO A PENSION
760	AGRIBUSINESS IS A SOURCE OF WEALTH FOR BRAZIL. LEGISLATION IMPOSES PARAMETERS FOR ITS SUSTAINABLE IMPLEMENTATION. BUT, DOES AGRIBUSINESS IN FACT COMPLY WITH SUCH LEGAL PRECEPTS? WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND LAW IN THE PROCESS OF ALIGNING ECONOMIC GROWTH WITH PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT? THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO CONTRIBUTE TO POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, BASED ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH AND THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD. IT WAS CONCLUDEDT HAT AGRIBUSINESS POLICIES HAVE SUCCUMBED TO MARKET INTERESTS. THE THEORY OF HUMAN CAPABILITIES CAN GUIDE THE CREATION OF PUBLIC POLICIES IN THE SECTOR.
761	SINCE THE UPHEAVAL OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION DECADE (1966-1976), POST-MAO CHINA HAS WITNESSED A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF UNPRECEDENTED LEGAL REFORM. CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS AND CITIZEN LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THEY PIT INDIVIDUAL LITIGANTS AGAINST THE AUTHORITARIAN CHINESE STATE, ARE TWO POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF LAW. WE EXAMINE AND CRITICALLY ASSESS THE SOCIOLEGAL SCHOLARSHIP ON CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL REFORM AS IT HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO SHIFTS IN THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM REGARDING LEGAL REFORM AND POLITICAL LIBERALISM IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE. ADDITIONALLY, WE OFFER BOTH THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR ENHANCING THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF SOCIOLEGAL RESEARCH IN CHINA.
762	THE PRESENT ARTICLE HAS AS OBJECTIVE THE PROBLEM OF THE LIMITS AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF PARTICIPATION IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM, FOR THIS REASON, SOME DISCUSSIONS WAGED BY JURISTS OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. SOME CONCEPTIONS POINTED TO A POSSIBILITY OF REACHING SOCIALISM THROUGH SOCIAL LAW AND STATE, OTHER WAYS OF DOING CAPITALISM, WHILE OTHER THEORIES AIMED, ON THE CONTRARY, TO EMPHASIZE PRECISELY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF RADICALLY MOVING REALITY BY MAKING USE OF THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE TIME. THIS MOSAIC OF RICH THEORIES OF THE STATE, OF POLITICS AND OF THE CONSTITUTION WILL SERVE TO CRITICIZE SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND TO POINT OUT THE POSSIBILITIES IN SUBSCRIBERS AND THE CONDITIONS SITUATED IN THEM.
763	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF SOUTH AFRICA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE VALUES EMBODIED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES OF THE UN SYSTEM AND ARGUES FOR A RE-EMPHASIS OF A RIGHTS-BASED FOREIGN POLICY GUIDED BY A NON-ALIGNMENT LOYAL ONLY TO THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORKS ESTABLISHED BY THE UN FOR GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. IT IS ARGUED THAT SOUTH AFRICA'S FOREIGN POLICY SHOULD BE MEASURED MAINLY IN TERMS OF ITS WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AS REPRESENTED BY THE UN, AND ITS SUPPORT OF THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORKS CODIFIED BY THE UN AS RELEVANT REFERENCE POINTS FOR ANY COUNTRY'S POLICY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT SOUTH AFRICA, DESPITE ITS CLAIMS OF BEING IN UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT OF SUCH RIGHTS-BASED AGENDA, MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO BETTER IF LESS GUIDED BY STRATEGIC PARAMETERS.
764	WE EXAMINE WHETHER THE AUTONOMY OF A COUNTRY'S CENTRAL BANK (CB) REDUCES THE PROBABILITY OF A BANKING CRISIS. WE TAKE A FINE-GRAINED APPROACH TO CB AUTONOMY BY DISENTANGLING ITS VARIOUS COMPONENTS AS WELL. IN ADDITION, WE LOOK AT THE JOINT EFFECTS OF CB AUTONOMY AND THE LEGAL TRADITION ON THE PROBABILITY OF A BANKING CRISIS IN A COUNTRY. USING THE CROSS-COUNTRY DATA FOR CB INDEPENDENCE FOR THE PERIOD OF 1980-1989, AND BOTH BINARY AND ORDERED LOGIT ESTIMATION MODELS, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT A COUNTRY'S CB WITH MORE AUTONOMY IN AGGREGATE CAN LESSEN THE PROBABILITY OF A BANKING CRISIS. WHEN THE CB'S AUTONOMY IS DISENTANGLED WITH RESPECT TO ITS RESPONSIBILITIES, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT THE LONGER THE TENURE OF THE CB'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE LOWER THE PROBABILITY OF A BANKING CRISIS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE PROBABILITY OF A BANKING CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY IS REDUCED EVEN MORE IF THE RELATIVELY MORE AUTONOMOUS CB CAN PERFORM ITS DUTIES IN LINE WITH THE COUNTRY'S STRONGER LAW-AND-ORDER TRADITION. WE ALSO CARRY OUT SOME COUNTERFACTUAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ALONG THESE LINES. COPYRIGHT (C) 2011 JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.
765	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES CONFRONT US AS AN ONGOING EMERGENCY. THE EPISTEMIC FEATURES OF SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT RELIABLY DISTINGUISH EX ANTE BETWEEN BENIGN POLICY CHOICES AND CHOICES THAT MAY LEAD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE - ARE THE SAME FEATURES OF AN EMERGENCY. THIS MEANS THAT, LIKE EMERGENCIES, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES POSE A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FOR THE RULE OF LAW: THEY REVEAL THE NECESSITY OF UNCONSTRAINED EXECUTIVE DISCRETION. DISCRETION IS WIDELY LAMENTED AS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, WHICH UNDERMINES BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF. THROUGH THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CRITIQUE OF THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF DISCRETION IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND SUGGESTS HOW AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BOTH CONSTITUTE AND CONSTRAIN THE STATE'S REGULATIVE AUTHORITY OVER THE ENVIRONMENT.
766	WE STUDY THE FREQUENCY OF RESTATEMENTS BY FOREIGN FIRMS LISTED ON U.S. EXCHANGES. WE FIND THAT THE RESTATEMENT RATE OF U.S.-LISTED FOREIGN FIRMS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF COMPARABLE U.S. FIRMS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE DEPENDS ON THE FIRM'S HOME COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS. FOREIGN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH A WEAK RULE OF LAW ARE LESS LIKELY TO RESTATE THAN ARE FIRMS FROM STRONG RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES. WHILE THE LOWER RATE OF RESTATEMENTS CAN REPRESENT AN ABSENCE OF ERRORS, IT CAN ALSO INDICATE A LACK OF DETECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF ERRORS AND IRREGULARITIES. WE INFER THE EFFECT OF DETECTION AND DISCLOSURE BY ASSOCIATING THE FREQUENCY OF RESTATEMENTS WITH THE QUALITY OF THE FIRM'S INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM. WE FIND THAT ONLY U.S. FIRMS AND FOREIGN FIRMS FROM STRONG RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES SHOW A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RESTATEMENT FREQUENCY AND INTERNAL CONTROL WEAKNESSES. FIRMS FROM WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION. WE INTERPRET THESE FINDINGS AS HOME COUNTRY ENFORCEMENT AFFECTING FIRMS' LIKELIHOOD OF DETECTING AND REPORTING EXISTING ACCOUNTING MISSTATEMENTS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FOR U.S.-LISTED FOREIGN FIRMS, LESS FREQUENT RESTATEMENTS CAN BE A SIGNAL OF OPPORTUNISTIC REPORTING RATHER THAN A LACK OF ACCOUNTING ERRORS AND IRREGULARITIES.
767	THE EU AND US ARE ESTABLISHED LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC POWERS, HAVING A SHARED POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL TRADITION. AS SUCH, THE PROMOTION OF DEMOCRACY IS CRITICAL TO THEIR FOREIGN POLICIES IN AREAS THEY DEEM TO BE OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO THEIR CORE INTERESTS. FURTHER, THE EU AND ITS DEMOCRATIZATION EFFORTS AS PART OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY AND STRATEGIC INTERESTS CAN BE VIEWED THROUGH THE 'FORTRESS EUROPE' CONCEPT AND HEGEMONIC STABILITY THEORY. FOR THE EU AND THE US, CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA ARE THE MAJOR AREAS FOR DEMOCRACY PROMOTION EFFORTS, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELATED EU AND US POLICIES PUBLISHED IN OPEN SOURCES AND ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE LOGIC OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS, EU AND US DEMOCRATIZATION EFFORTS COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS AN OSCILLATION BETWEEN CORE INTERESTS AND VALUES PROMOTION. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOSS OF APPEAL DUE TO SOCIO-POLITICAL-ECONOMIC ISSUES IN THE EU AND THE US, COMBINED WITH A RELATIVE LACK OF SUCCESS, AND COMPETITION BETWEEN ENTRENCHED ELITE POWER STRUCTURES AND ALTERNATIVE POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES. THE CRITICAL POINT IS THAT BOTH THE REGIONS OF CENTRAL ASIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA ARE POSTCOLONIAL AREAS IN WHICH WESTERN DEMOCRACY EFFORTS ARE BEING REALIZED THROUGH THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL LEVEL FOR SPREADING "SOFT POWER" TO INFLUENCE INTERNAL POLICY. THE KEY FINDINGS FOR BOTH REGIONS ARE BEING INTERPRETED FROM THE POSTCOLONIAL PERSPECTIVE: "DEMOCRATIZATION" IS THE PROCESS THAT NEEDS TO BE REVISED AS SOME CULTURAL AND METROPOLITAN DOMINANCE IN BOTH REGIONS PREVAILS IN EVERYDAY SOCIAL LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE POWER OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE IN CENTRAL ASIA DOES NOT MAKE REGIONAL ELITES FOLLOW THE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION STRUGGLING FOR THEIR NATIONAL IDENTITY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ERA, AS CENTRAL ASIAN ELITES AND SOCIETY DO NOT WISH TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT IN THE REGION. IN THE CASE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE AREA WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY COMMUNISM AT THE LEVEL CENTRAL ASIA WAS. THE AREA IS QUICKLY ADAPTABLE TO THE EXTERNAL (IN THIS CASE, THE US) DEMOCRATIZATION EFFORTS FOR MAKING A SOCIETY WITH LIBERAL VALUES AND MULTICULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT MAKES THEM DIFFERENT FROM OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN THE REGION IS MORE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ACCESS TO THE BEST EDUCATION AND WESTERN VALUES.
768	THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL'S (SDG) BLUEPRINT TO GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY EXEMPLIFIES THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE TREND TOWARDS THE DISPLACEMENT OF LAW BY INDICATORS. INDICATORS PURPORT TO PRODUCE OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT AND COMPARISON, A DESIRABLE TRAIT FOR INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES THAT STRUGGLE TO BOLSTER THE LEGITIMACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY NORMS. THIS PAPER ADOPTS A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO INDICATORS BY TAKING SERIOUSLY THEIR LIMITATIONS, WEAKNESSES, AND DANGERS, BUT ALSO THEIR POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY OBJECTIVES. WE EXPLORE A REFRAMING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND INDICATORS IN COMPLEMENTARY, NOT ADVERSARIAL, TERMS. SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THIS COMPLEMENTARITY ARE EXPLORED, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF THE SDGS FOR EVALUATING THE INSTRUMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL REGIMES, AS WELL AS THE WAYS THAT INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY LAW SUPPLEMENTS THE SGDS BY PROVIDING LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR VIOLATIONS OF STATE-SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY, WE ARGUE THAT LAW AND LEGAL NORMATIVITY MAKE INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE, CONTRIBUTIONS THAT METRICS AND OTHER MANAGERIAL AND TECHNOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNANCE CANNOT MAKE.
769	THE CHINESE POLITICO-LEGAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMPONENT THEREOF, HAS LONG BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INTENSE ACADEMIC AND POLICY INTEREST, DESPITE ITS INCREASINGLY 'SOFT' FEATURES. A MULTIYEAR ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY SOME LOOSENING OF GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL MECHANISMS BUT, BY WESTERN STANDARDS, THIS HAS BEEN A DISTINCTLY SLOW JOURNEY. THE ACQUISITION OF POWER BY THIS RAPIDLY RISING INTERNATIONAL PLAYER HAS ALSO GIVEN RISE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF A COMBINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL STATE CAPABILITIES AND AN AMBIVALENT POSTURE TOWARDS HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WIDELY CONCEIVED. IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVES, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY RESORTING TO SOCIAL SCIENCE-TYPE METHODOLOGICAL TOOLS AND EMPLOYING THEM IN ORDER TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORKINGS OF A RULE-BASED REGIME THAT STRADDLES DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL TERRITORY. CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, YET THE TASK HAS NOT BEEN APPROACHED EXHAUSTIVELY AND ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN AN INTERMITTENT AFFAIR. AN ELABORATE AND STRUCTURED LITERATURE REVIEW IS UNDERTAKEN HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING GAPS ON THIS SPECIFIC FRONT AND CONCRETE STRATEGIES TO NARROW THEM MATERIALLY.
770	NOT ONLY DOES PLATO'S LAWS PRESENT LIKELY THE MOST THOROUGH DEFENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ANNALS OF POLITICAL THOUGHT, IT ALSO CONTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE TEACHING ON HOW THE STEADY RULE OF LAW WORKS. I STRIVE TO ILLUMINATE PLATO'S IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF THE FUNCTIONING OF LAW BY INTERPRETING HIS THOUGHTS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WRITTEN LAW, ON THE ONE HAND, AND UNWRITTEN LAW-WHICH INCLUDES PRIMARILY HABITS-ON THE OTHER. MY ESSAY ANALYZES SEVERAL RELATED THEMES FROM PLATO'S LAWS, SUCH AS THE REASON WHY GOOD HABITS ARE ELEMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW; THE ROLE OF HABITUATION IN AND FOR POLITICAL EDUCATION; AND THE USE OF PLAY AND PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IN THE PROCESS OF HABITUATION. FINALLY, THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING HOW PLATO'S TEACHING IN THE LAWS CAN STRENGTHEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LAW RULES.
771	THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ROLE AND POWERS OF THE NINTH EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT OVER THE PAST 2,5 YEARS. IT IS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE TENDENCY TO STRENGTHEN THE ROLE AND INFLUENCE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE EU, WHICH WAS LAID DOWN IN THE LISBON TREATY, HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THESE CHANGES WERE MOSTLY OBSERVED IN SUCH AREAS AS DRAFTING AND APPROVAL OF THE EU BUDGET, INCLUDING THE LONG-TERM ONE, ECONOMIC POLICY, RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, INCLUDING LAWMAKING AND CONTROL OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THIS PROCESS IS NOT A LINEAR AND IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY TEMPORARY SETBACKS, AS IT HAPPENED, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LEAD CANDIDATE. IT IS REVEALED THAT THE POSITIONS OF THE LEADING EUROPEAN PARTIES: CONSERVATIVES AND SOCIAL DEMOCRATS CONSTANTLY WEAKENS, THE REPRESENTATION OF OTHER PARTIES, INCLUDING EUROSCEPTIC AND POPULIST ONES, IS EXPANDING. CONCLUSION IS DRAWN THAT THE TENDENCY OF THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE REDUCTION OF THE EUROPEAN PARTIES IS GOING TO REMAIN.
772	THE ARTICLE READS GARCIA MARQUEZ'S JOURNALISTIC NOVEL NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING AGAINST THE GRAIN, DEMONSTRATING ITS POTENTIAL FOR INTERROGATING UNIFYING NARRATIVES ABOUT GLOBAL LEGALITY. THE ARGUMENT HAS SEVERAL PARTS. FIRST, IT BUILDS UPON A CAREFUL TEXTUAL AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE LITERARY WORK IN QUESTION, PARSING OUT THE SUGGESTIVE COMPLEXITIES OF THE NOVEL'S NARRATIVE VOICE AND METAPHORS AS THEY CONFRONT ISSUES OF TRANSNATIONAL LEGITIMACY. SECONDLY, IT EXAMINES HOW GARCIA MARQUEZ'S NARRATIVE, PERHAPS UNINTENTIONALLY, ENGAGES WITH AND BUTTRESSES THE SELECTIVE SUSPENSION OF LEGALITY IN COLOMBIA ("THE EXCEPTION"). SPECIAL ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM MOVEMENT IN THIS CONTEXT, AS WELL AS TO THE NOVEL'S GRAPPLING WITH THE CONTRADICTIONS OF REASSERTING LEGALITY THROUGH LAWLESS MEANS. HEURISTICALLY, NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING IS THEN MEASURED AGAINST CONTEMPORARY JUDICIAL DECISIONS. IN CLOSING, THE ARTICLE SITUATES THE NOVEL WITHIN THE PANORAMA OF CONTEMPORARY LEGAL AND LITERARY STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE GLOBAL DRUG TRADE.
773	CONSERVATION REGULATIONS ARE INSTRUMENTAL FOR EFFECTIVE NATURE PRESERVATION, BUT SEVERAL COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES JEOPARDIZE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR OBJECTIVES, WITH STRONG POTENTIAL TO ERODE THEIR LEGITIMACY. UNDERSTANDING HOW SUCH DEFICITS IMPACT ON STAKEHOLDERS' PERCEPTIONS IS A MATTER OF CONCERN IN PURSUING TRULY EFFECTIVE TOOLS. HERE, USING AS CASE STUDY THE HETEROGENEOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF EU SANITARY REGULATIONS WHICH ALLOW LIVESTOCK CARCASSES TO BE LEFT IN SITU IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA, WE EVALUATED HOW UNEVEN IMPLEMENTATION AFFECTS FARMERS' PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS SCAVENGERS. WE INTERVIEWED 109 FARMERS AT THE BORDER BETWEEN SPAIN, WITH DESIGNATED SCAVENGER FEEDING ZONES (SFZS), AND PORTUGAL, WHERE SFZS ARE STILL UNDER WAY. WE DETECTED A DEFICIT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EUROPEAN SANITARY REGULATION AND A LOW KNOWLEDGE OF THIS LEGISLATION BY FARMERS (10%), WHICH LED TO MARKED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES IN THE PERCEPTION OF FARMERS ON SCAVENGERS. DESPITE BEING EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM SFZS, SPANISH FARMERS VALUED SCAVENGERS WORSE THAN PORTUGUESE FARMERS. THIS UNEXPECTED OUTCOME WOULD BE MEDIATED BY CA. 95% OF THE SPANISH FARMERS INTERVIEWED (N = 48) STILL USING THE CARCASS COLLECTION SYSTEM SET AFTER THE OUTBREAK OF THE MAD COW DISEASE, INSTEAD OF ADOPTING THE NEW RULES ALLOWING CARCASSES ABANDONMENT AT SFZS. CONTRASTINGLY, CA. 28% OF THE PORTUGUESE FARMERS (N = 61) LEFT LIVESTOCK CARCASSES IN THE FIELD WITHOUT OFFICIAL APPROVAL. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE INITIAL HYPOTHESIS OF MORE POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF SCAVENGERS BY FARMERS LEAVING LIVESTOCK CARCASSES IN SITU, WHILE WARNING AGAINST ASSUMING EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF SANITARY REGULATIONS IN REALITY. WORRYINGLY, AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF SPANISH FARMERS TOWARDS VULTURES, THESE IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES COULD TURN OUT TO AN EMERGENT FARMER-WILDLIFE CONFLICT, WHICH CAN JEOPARDIZE SCAVENGER CONSERVATION.
774	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW AND TARIFFS ON ILLEGAL TRADE IN CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCS) CONTROLLED BY THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL. SINCE DATA ON ILLEGAL TRADE IS NOT AVAILABLE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TEST ANY THEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT SMUGGLING. THE PAPER, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROBLEM BY DEVELOPING A MODEL OF ILLEGAL TRADE IN CFCS THAT DERIVES PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW AND TARIFFS ON BOTH LEGAL AND ILLEGAL IMPORTS OF CFCS. THEN THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS CONCERNING LEGAL IMPORTS ARE TESTED USING PANEL DATA ON CFC CONSUMPTION. USING THE ESTIMATES OF LEGAL IMPORTS, INFERENCES ABOUT ILLEGAL TRADE ARE MADE. THE BASIC FINDINGS INDICATE THAT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DEGREE OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION AND THE LEVEL OF TARIFFS IS NEEDED FOR THE CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA ON ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE REPORTED TO INTERNATIONAL MONITORING AGENCIES.
775	THE ARTICLE TALKS ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S STRATEGY AND DOCTRINE TO BUILD CHRIST'S SOCIAL KINGDOM DURING THE PONTIFICATES OF LEON XIII AND PIUS XI. THE AIM IS TO OFFER A POLITICAL CONTEXT FOR ALCEU AMOROSO LIMA'S ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF A NATION'S ORGANIC CONSTITUTION, THE PROJECT THAT GUIDED BRAZILIAN CATHOLICS' DEMANDS IN THE 1933-4 CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY. THE RESEARCH USED BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND DOCUMENTAL SOURCES, IN ADDITION TO A CONTEXTUAL AND CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE MATERIAL RESEARCHED.
776	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EUROPEANIZATION AND EU INTEGRATION IN THE FIELD OF JUDICIAL POLITICS. IT CLAIMS THAT THE PROCESS OF EUROPEANIZATION ENGENDERS CONTENTION WHICH CREATES DEMANDS FOR INCREASED SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNANCE. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS DUALITY, THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE WAVES OF REFORMS AIMING TO CONSOLIDATE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE NEW MEMBER STATES OF THE EU. WHAT IS AT STAKE FROM A POLITICAL AND NORMATIVE POINT OF VIEW IS THE POST-CONDITIONALITY DEBATE, THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE COPENHAGEN DILEMMA AND - CONVERSELY - THE NEED TO DEFINE AT THE EU LEVEL A SET OF EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS AND INSTRUMENTS OF COMPLIANCE. EMPIRICALLY, THE ARTICLE DISCLOSES THE DEAD ANGLES OF EUROPEANIZATION AND REVEALS THAT POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IN THE COPENHAGEN FRAMEWORK CREATES FUNCTIONAL AND POLITICAL PRESSURES FOR FURTHER INTEGRATION. IN THE FIELD OF JUDICIAL POLITICS, THE POWER OF THE EU OSCILLATES BETWEEN SPILL-OVER AND SPILL-BACK.
777	RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) COMES IN MANY FORMS, ONE OF WHICH IS THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF DOMESTIC COURTS IN ADDRESSING IHL-RELATED CASES. THIS ARTICLE TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT THE STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF IHL BY DOMESTIC COURTS, ELABORATES ON THE SPECTRUM OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO NATIONAL JUDGES WHEN FACED WITH IHL-RELATED CASES, AND DESCRIBES THE FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF COURTS IN ADOPTING A PARTICULAR POSTURE. IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT EVEN IF THE STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS ARE FULFILLED, THIS WILL NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN THE NORMATIVE APPLICATION OF THE LAW. IT APPEARS THAT NATIONAL JUDGES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEFINING THEIR OWN ROLES AS INDEPENDENT ORGANS FOR OVERSEEING THE STATE'S ACTS DURING ARMED CONFLICTS. IN THAT REGARD, THE ARTICLE OUTLINES A FEW SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON THE CHOICES COURTS MAKE AND THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THEM TO EFFECTIVELY HANDLE IHL-RELATED CASES.
778	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE MORAL PERMISSIBILITY OF VARIOUS DEFENCES OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU) VALUES AGAINST THEIR VIOLATION IN EU MEMBER STATES. THIS REQUIRES, FIRST, A COHERENT INTERPRETATION OF EU VALUES AS THE VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY; SECOND, A CLEAR NOTION OF WHEN THEY ARE VIOLATED; THIRD, A THEORY OF HOW LIBERAL DEMOCRACY CAN BE DEFENDED WITH MEASURES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY THEMSELVES; AND, FINALLY, A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE EU'S ROLE IS IN THIS DEFENCE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE FOR THE EU TO COMBINE A NUMBER OF POLITICAL, CULTURAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND LEGAL RESPONSES IN A CONCENTRIC DEFENCE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AS LONG AS THEY RESPECT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE AND DO NOT RELY ON PROBLEMATIC NOTIONS OF COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY.
779	TURKEY IS A CASE OF A MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRY THAT HAS KNOWN AN EXPERIENCE OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THE HISTORICAL PASSAGES THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE PATH TO DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY HAVE CONFIGURED THE CURRENT SET OF POWERS. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE HOW THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS IN TURKEY IS RELEVANT IN PROCEDURAL, SUBSTANTIVE, AND RESULT TERMS. IN THE FIRST PART IS UNDERTAKEN A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MODERNIZATION AND DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION CARRIED OUT BY TURKEY, ALSO ON THE BASIS OF THE ABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL CRITERIA. THE SECOND PART INVESTIGATES EIGHT DIMENSIONS IN WHICH DEMOCRACY SPREADS ITS EFFECTS IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY OF TURKEY.
780	WE INVESTIGATE THE DETERMINANTS OF THE FACT THAT MOST COUNTRIES CANNOT BORROW INTERNATIONALLY IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES (ORIGINAL SIN). OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES AND STRONG MACROECONOMIC POLICY STANCE WITH SOUND INSTITUTIONS ARE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR REDEMPTION FROM ORIGINAL SIN. ORIGINAL SIN APPEARS TO BE PERSISTENT AND DETERMINED ALSO BY THE VARIABLES WHICH ARE BEYOND THE SOLE CONTROL OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. CONSEQUENTLY, REDEMPTION FROM IT AND SATISFYING THE BLESSED TRINITY OF INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY, FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES AND SOUND INSTITUTIONS MAY REQUIRE AN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE THAT WILL ALLOW COMPLETE MARKETS FOR ALL CURRENCIES MEETING THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS.

781	WHY ARE JUDICIAL REVIEW MECHANISMS BEING INCORPORATED INTO SO MANY DEMOCRATIZING STATES? THIS STUDY ANALYZES WHY POLITICIANS CREATE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL INSTITUTION WITH THE AUTHORITY TO OVERRULE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. IT SHEDS LIGHT ON THE ROLE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS PLAY IN THE CONSOLIDATION PHASE OF A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, FOCUSING ON ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES WITH NO TRADITION OF INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL REVIEW OR OF DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNANCE-RUSSIAN PAST PRACTICES AND HISTORICAL PRECEDENT DO NOT SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF ALL INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IN RUSSIA, AND YET A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT NOW EXISTS. MOREOVER, DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRANSITION FROM THE SOVIET STATE TO THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC, THERE WERE THREE ATTEMPTS TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL REVIEW MECHANISM ONLY ONE OF WHICH COULD BE TERMED A SUCCESS. THIS ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE SELF-INTERESTED CALCULATIONS OF POLITICIANS IN FORMING EACH OF THESE THREE INSTITUTIONS, DEMONSTRATING THAT POLITICAL ACTORS ESTABLISH A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO ENHANCE THEIR DEMOCRATIC CREDIBILITY.

782	THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORES POLICE VIOLENCE DURING THE RIOTS IN LONDON AND GEZI PARK PROTESTS IN ISTANBUL. THIS STUDY PUTS FORTH THAT THE RISE OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE IN THE UK AND THE EROSION OF PLURAL DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY CLARIFY THE PARADOX OF STATE INTERVENTION BECAUSE THE TWO STATES PRIORITIZED RAPID REPRESSION OF UPRISING WITHOUT CONSOLIDATING PUBLIC TRUST AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE SOCIETY. THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY REVEALS THAT THE LIBERAL AND NON-RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE CAPITALIST RULING SYSTEM IN THE UK CONTAIN SIMILAR FRACTIONS OF STATE REPRESSION WHEN COMPARED TO THE AUTHORITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE CAPITALIST RULING SYSTEM IN TURKEY. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT POLICE VIOLENCE ENDURES THE SOCIAL CONTROL OF DISSIDENT COMMUNITIES WHILE IT MAINTAINS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF DIFFERENT CAPITALIST RULING SYSTEMS IN THE PERIODS OF SOCIAL UNREST.
783	BASED ON A STUDY ON THE THEORY OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO QUESTION THE SUPPOSED ONTOLOGICAL LINK BETWEEN REPRESENTATION, ELECTION AND DEMOCRACY THAT SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF ELECTORAL REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ANALYSIS, IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SO-CALLED REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM IS BASED ON A SEMANTIC IMPRECISION THAT CONFUSES THE CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF ITS NATURE, SINCE, WHEN CREATED, AT THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY, POLITICAL REPRESENTATION WAS THOUGHT AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA AND IN A NEGATION OF A TRUE REPRESENTATION. INDEED, WHEN EXAMINING THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM, WE WILL SEE THAT, BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF AN ORGAN DOES NOT DERIVE FROM ITS WAY OF DESIGNATION BUT FROM THE NATURE OF THE POWER EXERCISED BY IT, AS PIERRE BRUNET EXPLAINS. THUS, IT CAN BE CONFIRMED THAT REPRESENTATION, IN PUBLIC LAW, IS NOT PROCEDURAL BUT FUNCTIONAL, WHILE THE ELECTION IS ONLY A SIMPLE PROCESS OF SELECTING RULERS WHICH DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CREATE ANY TYPE OF REPRESENTATION. HENCE, THE THEORY OF THE STATE ORGAN WILL BE PRESENTED AS BEING MORE APPROPRIATE TO EXPLAIN THE LOGIC OF THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM. FINALLY, WE CONCLUDE THIS RESEARCH BY EMPHASIZING THE FACT THAT, WHILE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION STILL REMAIN IN FORCE TODAY, THE UNIVERSALIZATION OF SUFFRAGE AND THE STRENGTHENING OF POPULAR PARTICIPATION HAVE HELPED TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE MODERN REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM, WHICH, AS BERNARD MANIN SAYS, COULD BE DEFINED AS MIXED.
784	BETWEEN 2005 AND 2013, THE RUSSIAN STATE DUMA PASSED LEGISLATION RESTRICTING THE ACTIVITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS (HRDS). ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES COMPLICATE THEIR WORK, THIS STUDY CONTENDS THAT RUSSIAN HRDS CREATIVELY MANAGE CONSTRAINTS. THROUGH AN INTERVIEW STUDY, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENCE IN DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES BY IDENTIFYING THE COPING PRACTICES OF TWO GROUPS OF HRDS: OPPOSITION YOUTH ACTIVISTS IN MOSCOW AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS IN THE NORTHERN CAUCASUS. HERE, WE ARGUE THAT THOSE ACTIVISTS AT HIGH RISK OFTEN REINVENT THEIR TACTICS TO COUNTER CURTAILING LEGISLATION, EXPERIMENT WITH THE BOUNDARIES OF POLICE VIOLENCE AND MANAGE THE FEAR OF FELLOW ACTIVISTS.
785	CORRUPTION IS A "POISON" WHICH SQUANDERS GOVERNMENT RESOURCES, DETERS INVESTMENT AND IS DETRIMENTAL TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. IT FLOURISHES IF PEOPLE IN AUTHORITY ARE DISHONEST AND CORRUPT, THE STATE INSTITUTIONS ARE WEAK, AND THERE IS POLITICAL INSTABILITY, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNANCE AND DISREGARD OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT CAN BE CURBED IF THERE IS HONEST LEADERSHIP, MERITOCRACY, FINANCIAL CONTROL, DECENTRALIZATION, VIBRANT CIVIL SOCIETY AND MEDIA, TRANSPARENCY AND RULE OF LAW.
786	EVER SINCE ITS BIRTH, THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS HAS FACE A RELATIVELY SEVERE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AND REALISTIC INTERNAL MOTIVATION. THROUGH THE EXPLORATION OF INSTITUTIONALIZING AUTHORIZED LEGISLATION, THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES HAS FORMED A MULTI-LEVEL NORMATIVE SYSTEM. FIVE AREAS REPRESENTED BY INVESTMENT SYSTEM REFORM, TRADE FACILITATION, FINANCIAL REFORM, ADMINISTRATION, AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS CONSTITUTE THE CORE CONTENTS OF THE LEGAL INNOVATION OF PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF THE ZONES IS A TOP-LEVEL DESIGN OF CHINA'S RESPONSE TO THE COMPLICATED INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND, THE INEVITABLE REQUIREMENT TO PROMOTE INSTITUTION-BASED OPENING-UP, THE CENTRALIZED EMBODIMENT OF HIGH STANDARD ECONOMIC AND TRADE RULES, THE INEVITABLE WAY TO IMPROVE SOCIAL AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, AND THE EXPERIMENTAL FIELD TO PROMOTE THE PRACTICE AND INNOVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW REFORM. WITH THE UPGRADE AND EXPANSION OF PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HAINAN FREE TRADE PORT, THE ZONES FACE CORRESPONDING CHALLENGES OF CAPACITY UPGRADE, REPLICATION AND PROMOTION, AND PILOT ACCELERATION, WHICH NEED TO FURTHER EXPAND THE FUNCTION OF INTEGRATED INNOVATION, IN LINE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE STANDARDS, TO PROMOTE DEEPENING REFORM AND ACHIEVE HIGH QUALITY DEVELOPMENT. THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA'S PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES SHOULD ADHERE TO THE COMBINATION OF THE POSITIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PROBLEM ORIENTATION, FURTHER CLARIFY THE POSITIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF HIGH-LEVEL OPENING UP, AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S TOP-LEVEL DESIGN FOR THE LEGISLATION OF THE PILOT ZONES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA'S PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES.
787	CURRENT TRENDS INTENSIFY THE LONGSTANDING PROBLEM OF HOW THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE WELFARE STATE. WELFARE PROGRAMS ARE BEING REDESIGNED TO INCREASE THEIR CAPACITIES TO ADAPT TO RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS AND TO TAILOR THEIR RESPONSES TO DIVERSE CLIENTELES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS CHALLENGE THE UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY DEVELOPED IN THE WARREN COURT ERA. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON AN EMERGING MODEL OF ACCOUNTABLE ADMINISTRATION THAT STRIVES TO RECONCILE PROGRAMMATIC FLEXIBILITY WITH RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. THE MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE REFORM OF STATE CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES SYSTEMS, BUT IT HAS POTENTIALLY BROAD APPLICATION TO PUBLIC LAW. IT ALSO HAS NOVEL IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCH BASIC RULE-OF-LAW ISSUES AS THE CHOICE BETWEEN RULES AND STANDARDS, THE RELATION OF BUREAUCRATIC AND JUDICIAL CONTROL, THE PROPER SCOPE OF JUDICIAL INTERVENTION INTO DYSFUNCTIONAL PUBLIC AGENCIES, AND THE JUSTICIABILITY OF "POSITIVE" (OR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC) RIGHTS.
788	THE MAIN ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM IN CEE. IN PARTICULAR, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WAS ANALYZED USING A SYSTEM OF INDICATORS: POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF TERRORISM; EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES; QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY; RULE OF LAW; CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE REASONS OF APPLICATION FAILURES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND CONSEQUENCES OF ITS INTRODUCTION ARE OUTLINED. ALSO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE KEY FEATURES OF THE SIGMA PROGRAM, WHICH FORMED THE PRECONDITIONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE CEE COUNTRIES. THE REFORM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CLARIFIED. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS INFLUENCED BY SUCH INDICATORS AS: POLITICAL STABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE PRIORITY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND RULE-MAKING ACTIVITIES.
789	SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY, THE CHINESE ECONOMY HAS FACED SEVERAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, INCLUDING THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19, WHICH HINDERS GROWTH BOTH AT THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. HOWEVER, SUCH UNEVEN ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ARE NOT INDEPENDENT BUT ARE LINKED WITH THE VOLATILITY IN OTHER ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PRICES OF NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE ADDING THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (CONTROL OVER CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW) AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM FROM Q-1 1996 TO Q-4 2021. MOREOVER, THE MODERATING ROLE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAS ALSO BEEN TESTED IN THE LONG AND SHORT RUN THROUGH BOOTSTRAP AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGGED (BARDL) ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE. THE INITIAL FINDINGS CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF THE STATIONARITY PROPERTIES OF THE DATA AND THE LONG-TERM EQUILIBRIUM RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIABLES. LIKEWISE, THE LONG AND SHORT-RUN RESULT CONFIRMS THAT VOLATILITY IN THE PRICES OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND CORRUPTION IMPEDES GROWTH IN CHINA. YET, THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM HAS BEEN OBSERVED AS SIGNIFICANTLY PRODUCTIVE IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER THE LONG RUN. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT MODERATING ROLE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM IN DAMPENING/STRENGTHENING THE NEGATIVE/POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATURAL RESOURCES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, RESPECTIVELY. CONVERSELY, THE SHORT-TERM FINDINGS FURTHER REFLECT THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC PROGRESSION. OVERALL, THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT CHINA SHOULD FORMULATE RESILIENT-BASED POLICIES BY PROMOTING FREE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE SHOCKS OF COVID-19 ON NATURAL RESOURCE PRICES, EMPOWER THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL CORRUPTION FOR ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT.
790	SCHOLARS REMAIN DIVIDED OVER THE MEANING OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CHINESE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE ROLE OF LAW IN EMERGENCIES IN CHINA. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE DEBATES SURROUNDINGCHINA'S RULE OF LAW CLAIMS; SOME OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN PANDEMIC CONTROL MEASURES TAKEN IN WUHAN DURING THE EARLYOUTBREAK, INCLUDING THE CASE OF LI WENLIANG AND THE WUHAN LOCKDOWN; AND THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THOSE MEASURES
791	MULTIDIMENSIONAL MEASURES (COMPOSITE INDICATORS, INDICES, RATINGS, LEAGUE TABLES) CAN EFFECTIVELY UNDERPIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA-DRIVEN NARRATIVES IN SUPPORT TO POLICY. A CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS THE USE OF THESE MEASURES. WE REVIEW SOME GOOD AND BAD PRACTICES FROM THE RECENT LITERATURE. WE THEN DISCUSS BRIEFLY A DECALOGUE TO DEVELOP A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MEASURE. WE ARGUE IN FAVOR OF A MULTI-MODELING APPROACH TO REPRESENT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN AGGREGATE MEASURE PRIOR TO DRAWING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY MAKING. FINALLY, WE TRY TO ESTABLISH A LINK BETWEEN THE ANALYTIC USE OF WELL-DESIGNED AGGREGATE MEASURES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST CULTURE OF EVALUATION OF POLICIES BASED ON EVIDENCE. AN APPLICATION OF THESE CONCEPTS AND TOOLS TO THE RULE OF LAW INDEX DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT IS GIVEN.
792	IN THE WAKE OF THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL CRISIS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY, MILLIONS OF VENEZUELANS HAVE FLED TO NEIGHBORING COLOMBIA. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TEMPORARY SHELTERS IN COLOMBIA MEET THE NEEDS OF VENEZUELAN NEWCOMERS-AND WHY, IN MANY CASES, THEY DO NOT. USING THE FRAMEWORK OF TEMPORAL UNCERTAINTY, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW PERIODS OF WAITING PERPETUATE A FORM OF VIOLENCE ON MIGRANTS WHICH SHELTERS ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE. FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE CHALLENGES OF SHELTER WORK IN THIS CONTEXT AND THE OBSTACLES FACING ONE OF THE LARGEST MIGRATIONS IN THE WORLD TODAY.
793	IN TODAY'S SOCIETY, THE OPEN COURT PRINCIPLE CAN SOMETIMES CLASH WITH THE NEED FOR SECRECY ON NATIONAL SECURITY, NATIONAL DEFENCE, AND OTHER GROUNDS. GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD TO DEVISE SOLUTIONS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW WHILE KEEPING IN MIND THOSE CONCERNS. DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, CANADA HAS SET UP A SYSTEM OF SECRET HEARINGS UNDER THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE SYSTEM, WHILE PROVIDING SECURITY-CLEARED SPECIAL ADVOCATES FOR AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS, WHO CAN ACCESS SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THE AUTHORS SEEK TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON TWO QUESTIONS: HOW DO SECRET HEARINGS WORK AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO THEY ABIDE BY THE RULE OF LAW? THROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE MAJOR CANADIAN CASES ON SECRET HEARINGS UNDER THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE SYSTEM-ALMREI, CHARKAOUI, MAHJOUB, HARKAT, AND JABALLAH-AND INTERVIEWS WITH PRACTITIONERS INVOLVED IN THE SPECIAL ADVOCATE SYSTEM, THE AUTHORS PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON WHAT THE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE, AND HOW IT FITS WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE FEDERAL COURT'S DEVELOPMENT OF PROCEDURAL NORMS AND THE CONCERNS THESE UNCODIFIED NORMS RAISE FOR THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE SPECIAL ADVOCATE SYSTEM HAS PRODUCED HIGH-QUALITY LEGAL WORK, THERE IS REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT IS ABLE TO CONSTRAIN ARBITRARY DECISION MAKING IN SECRET HEARINGS.
794	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES A PARTICULAR VERSION OF CONTEMPORARY THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW: THE ROUTINIZATION OF EMERGENCY POWERS. ALTHOUGH THE GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC SINCE 2020 HAS CERTAINLY EPITOMIZED THE SUDDEN INFATUATION WITH STATES OF EMERGENCY (SOES), THEY HAVE A LONGER HISTORY OF BECOMING A NEW MODEL OF GOVERNMENT THAT HAS COME TO SATURATE OUR CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL HORIZON, AS EVERY CRISIS (TERRORISM, PANDEMIC, CLIMATE) SEEMS TO CALL FOR ITS OWN SOE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE UNPRECEDENTED PERMANENCE OF SOES IN CONTEMPORARY PARADIGMS OF GOVERNMENT. IT FIRST SITUATES THE CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE OF SOES IN THE LONGER HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL FRAME OF STATES OF EXCEPTION. IT THEN READS THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY RISE OF THE RULE-OF-LAW PARADIGM THAT IS LARGELY UNDERGIRDED BY AN AMBITION TO TAME THE EXCEPTION AS A CHALLENGE TO THIS STATE OF EXCEPTION FRAMEWORK. HENCE ITS FAILURE TO PROVIDE A RELEVANT LENS FOR ANALYZING CONTEMPORARY SOES. THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF RECENT FRENCH EXPERIENCES OF AN SOE, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT RATHER THAN DEROGATE TO OR SUSPEND THE LEGAL ORDER, CONTEMPORARY SOES ARE INTENSELY JURIDICAL AND CLAIM TO BE FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IN THAT, THEY SET A DANGEROUS TRAP: AS THEY BORROW THE FORMS AND LANGUAGE OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONTEMPORARY SOES THREATEN TO SUBVERT THE MODEL'S MEANING AND SENSE FROM THE INSIDE.
795	IN THIS ARTICLE, I OFFER A FRAMING OF THE DEBATES AROUND MANDATORY MEDIATION THAT REST ON THE PREMISE THAT A LEGITIMATE CIVIL JUSTICE PROCESS DEPENDS ON UNHINDERED ACCESS TO AN ADJUDICATIVE SYSTEM, WHICH MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS A PROCEDURAL RIGHT. THIS IS A KEYSTONE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND A VALID LEGAL SYSTEM THAT DESERVES THE AUTHORITY THAT IT ASSERTS IS CONTINGENT ON THIS. MY CENTRAL THESIS IS THAT REQUIRING MEDIATION (WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE RULE OF LAW) BEFORE ALLOWING FULL ACCESS TO ADJUDICATION COMPROMISES THE PROCEDURAL RIGHTS OF LEGAL SUBJECTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. SUCH A MANDATE IS, THEREFORE, AN IMPROPER EXERCISE OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. THIS DOES NOT, HOWEVER, MEAN THAT MEDIATION CANNOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN ENHANCING THE CIVIL JUSTICE COMMITMENT TO HUMAN DIGNITY. THE BENEFITS THAT ABOUND IN MEDIATION SHOULD BE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MEDIATION CAN (WHEN IT FUNCTIONS WELL) OFFER AUTONOMOUS, EMPOWERED DECISION-MAKING. THE ANALYSES THAT I OFFER HERE PAVE THE ROAD FOR DETERMINING, PRAGMATICALLY, HOW MEDIATION SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEMS, SUCH THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE LEGAL CLAIMS ADJUDICATED IN A SYSTEM THAT CENTRALIZES THE RULE OF LAW AND MAY ALSO CHOOSE AN EQUITABLE AND WELL-STRUCTURED MEDIATION SYSTEM THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS RAISED BY CRITICAL RACE AND FEMINIST SCHOLARS ABOUT INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
796	CURRENTLY, BESIDES TRADITIONAL NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, THERE ARE THREE GENERAL APPROACHES TO CONSTITUTIONALISM IN THE WORLD: TRANSNATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM, THEOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND PARTY-STATE CONSTITU-TIONALISM. THE FOCUS OF THIS ARTICLE IS ON LARRY BACKER'S RESEARCH CONCERNING CHINA'S PARTY-STATE SYSTEM. PARTY-STATE CONSTITUTIONALISM IS ROOTED IN MARXISM-LENINISM, AND WAS INITIALLY PUT INTO PRACTICE BY THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN ITS EARLY YEARS LARGELY FOLLOWED IN THE USSR'S FOOTSTEPS AND DEVELOPED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM UNDER THE TRADITIONAL SOVIET FRAMEWORK. HOWEVER, SINCE 1982, THE CHINESE PARTY-STATE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM HAS UNDERGONE SEVERAL MAJOR REFORMS, AND CHINA HAS BEEN GRADUALLY TRANSFORMING INTO A SINGLE-PARTY CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. GROUNDED IN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE PARTY AND THE STATE, THIS NEW CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL SERVES TO FURTHER THE RULE OF LAW, REAFFIRM THE PARAMOUNT AUTHORITY OF THE CONSTITUTION, AND DYNAMICALLY BALANCE THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S (CCP'S) LEADERSHIP POSITION WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE CCP, BEING AN ARTICULATOR OF SOCIAL NORMS AND VALUES, PROVIDES THE SUBSTANTIVE NORMS AND VALUES THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THE RULE-OF-LAW CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTION, IN TURN, SERVES TO LIMIT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTY, SO THAT THE CCP WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW.
797	THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW A HOST COUNTRY'S LEGAL ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCES INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE (IJV) PARTNER SELECTION CRITERIA. EMPIRICAL RESULTS BASED ON SURVEY DATA COLLECTED ON 169 IJVS REVEALED THAT HOST-COUNTRY RULE OF LAW PERCEPTIONS NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE APPROPRIATION AND COORDINATION COST CONCERNS, WHICH POSITIVELY INFLUENCE PARTNER-RELATED CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, THESE CONCERNS MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS OF HOST-COUNTRY RULE OF LAW AND PARTNER-RELATED CRITERIA. JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES (2009) 40, 779-801.
798	CURRENT EVENTS (CORSICA, YUGOSLAVIA, ETC.) SOMETIMES GIVE FLASHES OF INSIGHT INTO THE RELATION OF OUR SO-CALLED DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE USE OR PERVERSION OF LAW AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO SERVE NON-DEMOCRATIC ENDS CONSTITUTES A DANGER FOR SOCIETY AND FOR THE VERY CREDIBILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM: BOTH THE SETTING-UP AND THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE ESSENTIAL CRITERIA OF A SOCIETY'S SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONING.
799	THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IS CONSTITUTED BY MEANS OF THE INTERNAL TENSION BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS BECAUSE, BESIDES ITS OWN FUNCTIONS, SINCE LAW MUST REGULATE INTERPERSONAL OR COLLECTIVE CONFLICTS OF ACTION WHILE POLITICS MUST CARRY OUT COLLECTIVE PROGRAMS OF ACTION, EACH ONE MUST PERFORM RECIPROCAL FUNCTIONS CONCERNING THE OTHER, SINCE POLITICS, AS AN INSTRUMENTAL POLE, MUST PROVIDE JURIDICAL NORMS WITH THE CAPACITY OF COACTION, WHILE LAW, AS A NORMATIVE POLE, MUST LEND ITS OWN LEGITIMACY TO POLITICAL DECISIONS. FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AN INTER-SUBJECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY IS NECESSARY BASED ON THE THEORY OF DISCOURSE ACCORDING TO WHICH SOVEREIGNTY IS NOT LOCALIZED IN ANY CONCRETE SUBJECT, BUT IS DISPERSED IN THE BROAD NET OF COMMUNICATION THAT UNDERLIES THE PUBLIC SPHERE, WHERE THE COMMUNICATIVE POWER IS FORMED, BEING CAPABLE TO NEUTRALIZE THE SOCIAL POWER OF PRESSURE GROUPS AND FORM A PUBLIC OPINION THAT ORIENTATES DECISION MAKING AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER OF THE RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS.
800	ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2020, THE UNITED STATES SANCTIONED TWO INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) OFFICIALS, UNDER AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED 3 MONTHS PREVIOUSLY. IN RESPONSE, OVER TWO-THIRDS OF ICC STATES PARTIES ISSUED OR JOINED PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUPPORTING THE COURT. WHY DID SOME ICC MEMBERS CONDEMN THE SANCTIONS OR OTHERWISE EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE COURT, WHILE OTHERS DID NOT? WE BEGIN BY DOCUMENTING VARIATION IN THE TYPE AND TIMING OF STATEMENTS BEFORE PROPOSING AND TESTING A THEORY FOCUSED ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN SECURITY DEPENDENCE ON THE UNITED STATES AND DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW NORMS. WE FIND THAT STATES MORE DEPENDENT ON THE UNITED STATES FOR SECURITY WERE LESS LIKELY TO ISSUE STATEMENTS; FURTHERMORE, AMONG STATES THAT ISSUED STATEMENTS, SECURITY DEPENDENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING WEAKER-AND FEWER-STATEMENTS. CONVERSELY, STATES WITH STRONGER DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW ISSUED STRONGER-AND MORE-STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH RULE OF LAW WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING ANY STATEMENT.
801	MOST POST-CONFLICT RECONCILIATORY EXERCISES MAKE IT INCUMBENT UPON SURVIVORS TO FORGIVE, AND SEEK CLOSURE AS A DEMONSTRATION OF 'MOVING ON'. VARIOUS ANTHROPOLOGISTS HAVE CRITICIZED RECONCILIATION AND RELATED FORMS OF 'ALTERNATIVE JUSTICE' EXTENSIVELY BUT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF MAINTAINING SOCIAL BONDS AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS INTRODUCTION, I REFLECT CRITICALLY ON THE INTERDISCIPLINARY SCHOLARSHIP ON RECONCILIATION, APOLOGY, AND FORGIVENESS, AND THEORIZE IRRECONCILIATION AS A LESS EXAMINED LENS OF ANALYSIS. RATHER THAN BEING IN OPPOSITION TO 'PEACE', IRRECONCILIATION ALLOWS US TO INTERROGATE THE STATUS QUO BY REFUSING TO FORGIVE ENDEMIC IMPUNITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFTERMATH OF STAGED PROCESSES OF JUSTICE AND THE ABSENCE-PRESENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE JRAI, I ETHNOGRAPHICALLY EXPLORE IRRECONCILIATION'S LINKS WITH LAW, AESTHETICS, TEMPORALITY, RESISTANCE, AND CONTROL TO LOCATE ITS MULTIPLE ANALYTICAL MANIFESTATIONS. IRRECONCILIATION ALLOWS AN IMPORTANT EXAMINATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN PROCESSES OF UNRESOLVED GENOCIDAL INJUSTICES AND DEBATES RELATING TO SLAVERY, BLACK LIVES MATTER, AND INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSES.
802	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES GOVERNMENT QUALITY DETERMINANTS OF ICT ADOPTION USING GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS ON A PANEL OF 49 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2000-2012. ICT IS MEASURED WITH MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION, INTERNET PENETRATION AND TELEPHONE PENETRATION RATES WHILE ALL GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS FROM THE WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE CONSIDERED, NAMELY: POLITICAL GOVERNANCE (CONSISTING OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND "VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY"); ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE (ENTAILING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND REGULATION QUALITY) AND INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE (ENCOMPASSING THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL). THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE POSITIVE SHORT-RUN AND NEGATIVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION. SECOND, THE RULE OF LAW HAS A POSITIVE (NEGATIVE) SHORT-RUN (LONG-TERM) EFFECT ON INTERNET PENETRATION. THIRD, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL HAVE POSITIVE SHORT-RUN AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON TELEPHONE PENETRATION. INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE APPEARS TO BE MOST SIGNIFICANT IN DETERMINING ICT ADOPTION IN SSA.
803	WITH THE GENERAL ELECTIONS OF NOVEMBER 2010, STATE RULE IN MYANMAR ENTERED A PROCESS WIDELY SEEN AS A TRANSITIONIF STALLEDTO DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. SUCH TRANSITION NARRATIVES HAVE POSITED NORMATIVE RULE OF LAW AND ARBITRARY RULE OUTSIDE LAW AS OPPOSING LOGICS, AND OPPOSING PRACTICES. A SIMILAR DICHOTOMY IS FOUND IN STUDIES OF LABOUR INFORMALISATION IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, WHERE INFORMAL LABOUR IS UNDERSTOOD AS ANTITHETICAL TO LEGALLY PROTECTED EMPLOYMENT. ARGUING OTHERWISE, THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS INTERVIEW AND ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA TO PURSUE AN ANTHROPOLOGY OF STATE FORMATION AS A MEANS OF READING FORMALITY AND INFORMALITY AS COMPLEMENTARY, RATHER THAN CONFLICTING, LOGICS OF STATE PRACTICE. DRAWING ON GAVIN SMITH'S NOTION OF SELECTIVE HEGEMONY, I HOLD THAT STATE ACTORS IN MYANMAR HAVE PURSUED VARIED PROJECTS OF RULE OVER A HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE OF LABOUR RELATIONS. IN THIS RESPECT, RULE OF LAW IS ALWAYS SELECTIVE, AND INFORMALITY EXHIBITS NOT SO MUCH AN ABSENCE OF STATE RULE AS AN INDIRECT MODALITY OF RULE.
804	MOST EVIDENCE FOR THE RESOURCE CURSE COMES FROM CROSS-COUNTRY GROWTH REGRESSIONS SUFFERS FROM BIAS ORIGINATING FROM THE HIGH AND EVER-EVOLVING VOLATILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES. THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDING NEW CROSS-COUNTRY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF RESOURCES IN INCOME PER CAPITA. NATURAL RESOURCE DEPENDENCE (RESOURCE EXPORTS) HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INCOME PER CAPITA, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WITH BAD RULE OF LAW OR BAD POLICIES, BUT THESE RESULTS WEAKEN SUBSTANTIALLY ONCE WE ALLOW FOR ENDOGENEITY. HOWEVER, THE MORE EXOGENOUS MEASURE OF RESOURCE ABUNDANCE (STOCK OF NATURAL CAPITAL) HAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INCOME PER CAPITA EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR GEOGRAPHY, RULE OF LAW AND DE FACTO OR DE JURE TRADE OPENNESS. FURTHERMORE, THIS EFFECT IS MORE SEVERE FOR COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LITTLE DE JURE TRADE OPENNESS. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO USING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY (EXPROPRIATION AND CORRUPTION INSTEAD OF RULE OF LAW).
805	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE DILEMMA OF HOW TO FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN SECURITY AND LIBERTY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. IT SHOWS HOW DIFFERENT IMPLIED PRESUPPOSITIONS CONCERNING THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY, THE SIZE OF THE PERCEIVED THREAT AND THE MAIN PROTECTED VALUE (STATE VS. CONSTITUTION) SHAPE THE DEBATE. THE ARTICLE ALSO GIVES A MAP OF THE US AND GERMAN DISCOURSES CONCERNING LIFE SAVING TORTURE (RETTUNGSFOLTER), AND CONCLUDES THAT IN ORDER TO CLARIFY POSITIONS, DIFFERENT QUESTIONS (DE CONSTITUTIONE LATA QUESTIONS, DE LEGE LATA QUESTIONS, DE LEGE FERENDA QUESTIONS AND MORAL QUESTIONS) HAVE TO BE SEPARATED.
806	THIS SHORT REPLY CLARIFIES AND DEFENDS THE ARGUMENT PRESENTED IN "THE ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY AND THE LEGALITY OF DISCRETION IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW." IT RESPONDS TO THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE, AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE, IN PARDY'S CRITIQUE "AN UNBEARABLE LICENCE." THE REPLY FURTHER DEVELOPS THE PUBLIC-JUSTIFICATION CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ARGUING THAT IT IS AT HOME WITHIN CANADIAN PUBLIC LAW. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT THIS CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW HIGHLIGHTS POSSIBILITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.
807	RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF SINGAPORE'S NATIONHOOD, AN OBVIOUS AND UNBRIDGEABLE DISCONNECT APPEARED BETWEEN ITS LEADERSHIP'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND THE ASPIRATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM OF ITS LEGAL COMMUNITY. SINGAPORE'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP HAS SPENT MUCH ENERGY ARTICULATING A "PRAGMATIC" IDEOLOGY ON POLITICAL GOVERNANCE PLACING PRIMACY ON ECONOMIC PROGRESS, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND NATION-BUILDING AND EMPHASISING A "COMMUNITARIAN" APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP'S CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW SMACKS OF A "THIN" ONE. THE GOVERNMENT RELIGIOUSLY ADHERES TO LEGAL FORMALITIES, RATHER THAN SUBSTANTIVE THEORIES OF POLITICAL MORALITY, TO LEGITIMISE ITS ACTIONS, IF PRIMARILY FOR THE INSTRUMENTAL ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE SEMINAL COURT OF APPEAL CASE OF CHNG SUAN TZE V MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT'S IMMEDIATE AND HARD-HITTING CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS - OVERRULING THE COURT'S DECISION ON A PREVENTIVE DETENTION CASE - CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED ITS INTENT TO ENSURE THAT THE SINGAPORE JUDICIARY ACCEPT ITS LIMITED ROLE AND THAT THE JUDICIARY ACCEPT A CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED BY THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES IN DETAIL HOW THE SINGAPORE JUDICIARY'S ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S "THIN" CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS A DIRECT BEARING ON THE APPROACH TAKEN TOWARDS CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION IN SINGAPORE.
808	CONSTITUTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS IS A GENERAL TERM FOR CITIZENS' KNOWLEDGE, OPINIONS, IDEAS AND THINKING ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. IT NOT ONLY DRIVES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO SERVES AS AN INDICATOR FOR THE EXTENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE COURSE OF SOCIAL CHANGE, CONSTITUTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS CONSTITUTES AN INNER SPIRITUAL FORCE WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. IT IS A FORCE FOR CHANGE IN ITSELF, ESPECIALLY AS "A CULTURAL SOFT POWER" THAT REMOLDS NORMATIVE JUDGMENTS AND VALUE BASES. A STABLE AND MATURE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR THE BENIGN OPERATION OF SOCIAL CHANGE. OVER THE PAST 60 YEARS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE SOCIETY HAS FOLLOWED A TORTUOUS PATH, BUT DUE TO CITIZENS' CONSTITUTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS THE 1954 AND 1982 CONSTITUTIONS WERE ALWAYS VEHICLES AND FORCES FOR SOCIAL COHESION AND HARMONY. THE WAY TO IMPROVE SUPERVISION OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION IS TO TRULY MAKE RULE OF LAW THINKING CENTERED ON CONSTITUTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INTO THE BASIC VALUE CONSENSUS OF CITIZENS AND DIFFERENT GROUPS AT THE LEVEL OF THE NATION, THE GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY. ADHERING TO THE CONCEPT OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND EXPLORING WAYS AND MEANS OF ADOPTING A MORE REASONABLE, PRAGMATIC AND OPEN APPROACH TO ITS IMPLEMENTATION WILL PROVIDE A SOLID CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION FOR THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW AND WILL ADVANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RULE OF LAW CHINA.
809	THE THIRD PLENARY SESSION OF THE 11TH CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA HELD IN 1978 MARKED THE INITIATION OF THE POLICY OF REFORM AND OPENING UP IN CHINA, BEGINNING A NEW CHAPTER IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM. THE FIRST CHINESE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW WAS PROMULGATED THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND WAS REVISED TWICE IN 1996 AND 2012. ALTHOUGH REMARKABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE, THE LEVEL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S CRIMINAL PROCEDURE MUST STILL BE IMPROVED TO MEET THE GOAL OF MODERNIZING THE CRIMINAL RULE OF LAW.
810	NEW NATIONAL SECURITY (NNS) REPRESENTS A TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY'S SOCIOLOGICAL PARADIGM ON WHICH THE LAW IS BASED ON AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY MULTIPLE ACTORS, WIDE COVERING, LOW PREDICTABILITY, SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTION, DUAL NATURE, AND RAMPANT DIFFUSION. THE EMERGENCE AND EXPANSION OF THE NNS PROMPTS A HIGHLY ADVANCED PERSPECTIVE TO THE RULE OF LAW AT BOTH THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, SPECIFICALLY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LAW. IN THIS CONTEXT, TRADITIONAL APPROACHES, 'INTERNATIONAL APPROACH' OR 'NATIONAL APPROACH,' ARE INSUFFICIENT, SO THAT A NEW 'MANAGERIAL APPROACH' IS THUS NEEDED. THE LEGAL PRACTICE IN RELATION TO NATIONAL SECURITY OF CHINA, A RISING GREAT POWER, ATTRACTS CLOSE ATTENTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHINESE CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY HAS ITS OWN 'CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS,' HOW CHINA WILL ENFORCE ITS NATIONAL SECURITY LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW REMAINS TO BE SEEN. THE NNS WILL LEAD PROFOUND SOCIOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION UPON WHICH ALL LEGAL ORDERS ARE BASED.
811	PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREND IN JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS IN THE LAST DECADE IN FRAGILE STATES AND DEVELOPING SOCIETIES HAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. THIS TREND IS PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE POOR TRACK RECORD OF INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT TRANSFORMING FORMAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS INTO WELL-FUNCTIONING SYSTEMS THAT MEET THE IDEALS OF WESTERN RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO REFLECTS AN EFFORT TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS AN EMPIRICAL FACT - IN MANY SOCIETIES, INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS ARE THE PRIMARY LOCUS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE IGNORED. HOWEVER, THE RHETORICAL RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMAL SYSTEMS HAS FAR OUTPACED CHANGE IN STRATEGIES OR EVEN PROGRAMMING. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS, BUT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS A NORMATIVE ONE. INTERNATIONAL ACTORS REGARD THE ALTERNATIVE PARADIGMS OF JUSTICE OFFERED BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS DESIRABLE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY OFF ER ACCESSIBLE AND RESTORATIVE REMEDIES IN WAYS THAT DO NOT CONTRAVENE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. HERE, THE RECOGNIZED ADVANTAGES TEND TO BE OUTWEIGHED IN THE MINDS OF MANY DEVELOPMENT ACTORS BY THE PERCEIVED FAILURE OF INFORMAL SYSTEMS TO COMPLY WITH THESE NORMS - ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS. THE DILEMMA THIS POSES HAS RESULTED IN TWO PRIMARY APPROACHES. THE FIRST ASSUMES THAT INFORMAL SYSTEMS ARE INHERENTLY AND IRREMEDIABLY INCONSISTENT WITH WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND THEREFORE THE FORMAL SYSTEM MUST BE THE PRIMARY, IF NOT SOLE, FORUM FOR ADJUDICATING DISPUTES INVOLVING WOMEN. THE SECOND APPROACH SEEKS TO ENGAGE WITH INFORMAL SYSTEMS WITH THE AIM OF TRANSFORMING THEM TO COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, WHILE RETAINING THE POSITIVE FEATURES OF ACCESSIBILITY, FAMILIARITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. THIS NOTE NOTE DISCUSSES AND ANALYSES THE LIMITATION OF THESE TWO APPROACHES. ULTIMATELY, IT IS ARGUED HERE, THEY ARE FLAWED. THIS NOTE PRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF PROBLEMATIZING WOMEN'S ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND CORRESPONDING WAYS OF ADDRESSING THE INEQUALITY. RATHER THAN FOCUS ON SELECTING, PROMOTING OR CHANGING THE FORMAL OR INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, INTERVENORS NEED TO EMBRACE PROCESSES OF SOCIAL CHANGE AS THE MEANS FOR INSTITUTING LEGAL CHANGE.
812	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE DYSFUNCTIONALITIES OF POLISH DEMOCRACY THAT HAS SEEN THE STABILITY OF THE POWER-OPPOSITION SYSTEM DISTURBED; AND SOCIETY LEFT SUFFERING UNDER THE TOTALITY OF POLITICAL POLARISATION. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WITHIN A POLARISED SOCIETY ONLY ONE SOLUTION CAN BE THE LEADING ONE, THE SOCIETY AND THE STATE, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY DIVIDED, WHICH HAS NOT ONLY IMPACTED POLISH SOCIETY'S IMAGE OF ITSELF, BUT ALSO POLAND'S STANDING AND RELATIONS ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA CAN BE TRACED TO MULTIPLE EVENTS THAT STARTED YEARS BEFORE POLAND BECAME BESET BY A CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE WILL ANALYSE POLITICAL AND LEGAL CHANGES IN POLAND WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC FRAMES, WHICH NO LONGER FULFIL THE PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TASKS. IT WILL ALSO MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN AFFECTIVE POLITICAL POLARISATION AND DYSFUNCTIONS OF DEMOCRACY THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A WORSENING OF THE STABILITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. FINALLY, IT WILL SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE COUNTRY'S DYSFUNCTIONALITY ON BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAGES.
813	THE RISE OF THE SYNTHETIC OPIOID EPIDEMIC HAS TIME AND TIME AGAIN BROUGHT CRITICISM ON CHINA AND INDIA, THE WORLD'S TWO MAIN PRODUCERS OF FENTANYL AND ITS CHEMICAL PRECURSORS. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO STRENGTHEN REGULATIONS OVER FENTANYL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION, THOUGH ITS EFFECTS ON GLOBAL DRUG GOVERNANCE REMAIN UNDER SCRUTINY. THIS STUDY USED QUALITATIVE AND COMPARATIVE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT REGULATORY LANDSCAPE FOR FENTANYL, INCLUDING ITS EFFICIENCY AND POTENTIAL LOOPHOLES IN CHINA AND INDIA. IT CONCLUDES THAT ALTHOUGH BOTH CHINA AND INDIA ARE ACTIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY ATTEMPTING TO STEP AWAY FROM THE GLOBAL FENTANYL SUPPLY CHAIN, THESE EFFORTS REMAIN INEFFECTIVE DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL LOOPHOLES, NAMELY INADEQUATE LEGISLATION AND FRAGMENTED REGULATORY STRUCTURES. FROM INSIGHTS GAINED ON GLOBAL DRUG GOVERNANCE, WE RECOMMEND A BINDING INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION CONCENTRATED ON CONTROLLING FENTANYL AND ITS RELATED SUBSTANCES, WITH FURTHER BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL COOPERATION AMONG STATES AS NECESSARY COMPLEMENTATION.
814	MOST CRITICISM AND EXPOSITION OF JOHN RAWLS'S POLITICAL THEORY HAS FOCUSED ON HIS ACCOUNT OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE RATHER THAN ON HIS SUPPORT FOR LIBERALISM. BECAUSE OF THIS, MUCH OF HIS ARGUMENT FOR PROTECTING THE BASIC LIBERTIES REMAINS UNDER EXPLAINED. SPECIFICALLY, RAWLS CLAIMS THAT REPRESENTATIVE CITIZENS WOULD AGREE TO GUARANTEE THOSE SOCIAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE TWO MORAL POWERS, BUT HE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN WHY PROTECTING THE BASIC LIBERTIES WOULD GUARANTEE THESE SOCIAL CONDITIONS. THIS GAP IN HIS ARGUMENT LEADS TO TWO PROBLEMS. FIRST, THE RAWLSIAN ARGUMENT FOR THE PRIORITY OF LIBERTY WOULD FAIL IF THE GAP COULD NOT BE FILLED. HIS ARGUMENT WOULD STILL SUPPORT THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS, BUT THESE FREEDOMS WOULD BE TREATED LIKE OTHER PRIMARY GOODS AND REGULATED BY THE DIFFERENCE PRINCIPLE. SECOND, WITHOUT A FULL ARGUMENT, THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT REASON TO FAVOR RAWLS'S LEFT-LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF THE BASIC LIBERTIES OVER A MORE RIGHT-LEANING CONCEPTION THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE THE PROTECTION OF FREE-MARKET RIGHTS. TO ADDRESS THESE TWO PROBLEMS, THIS PAPER FILLS IN THE GAP IN ORDER TO BETTER EXPLAIN RAWLS'S FULL ARGUMENT FOR EGALITARIAN LIBERALISM.
815	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE BASIS AND REALITY OF INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY AND THE UNIVERSALITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS FROM AN ISLAMIC PERSPECTIVE. THE AUTHOR CALLS FOR PRINCIPLED COMMITMENT AND SYSTEMATIC RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW TO ENCOURAGE MUSLIMS TO ABANDON TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF JIHAD. SIMILARLY, SINCE THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL, THE ABSENCE OF THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY AND VIABILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS.
816	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE NATURE OF MOB RULE AND RULE OF LAW, ARGUING THAT AMERICAN HISTORIES OF LYNCHING INDICATE IT HAS BEEN A FORM OF STATE-SANCTIONED VIOLENCE RATHER THAN A RESULT OF 'LAWLESSNESS.' THE ARTICLE FURTHERMORE ARGUES THAT PRO-LYNCHING DISCOURSES REMAIN UBIQUITOUS IN CONTEMPORARY US CULTURE, DESPITE OSTENSIBLE REJECTION OF THE PRACTICE. THE PERSISTENCE OF PRO-LYNCHING IDEOLOGIES AND 'MODERN-DAY LYNCHINGS' INDICATES THE ONGOING NEED FOR ANTI-LYNCHING MOVEMENTS; BUT, MY ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THESE MOVEMENTS WILL BE MOST SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY CRITIQUE THE RULE OF LAW RATHER THAN IDEALIZE IT.
817	THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT WHICH IS RECENT, PROMINENT, AND DEEPLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY. AS IT IS PRESENT IN THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF LAW, IT IS, HOWEVER, CONSTANTLY EVOLVING. AS AN "OBJECTIVE RULE OF LAW", DIGNITY MUST BE RECONCILED WITH SOME OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IN PARTICULAR FREEDOM. HOWEVER, IT'S STILL EVOLVING TOWARDS A "SUBJECTIVE RULE OF LAW". THE FRENCH NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE FOR ETHICS(CCNE) PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING THIS CONCEPT THROUGH ITS STATEMENTS. (C) 2014 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER MASSON SAS.
818	WORKER CO-OPERATIVES GENERALLY EMBRACE DEMOCRACY IN THEIR OWNERSHIP AND DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE COMMITMENT TO A FLAT ORGANISATIONAL HIERARCHY, IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUAL WAGE POLICY, AND THE PURSUIT OF A STRONG ETHICAL POLICY POSITION THESE CO-OPERATIVES ON THE HIGHLY PRINCIPLED SIDE OF THE CO-OPERATIVE LANDSCAPE IN THE UK. THIS PAPER DRAWS ON AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF FIVE SUCH PRINCIPLED WORKERS' CO-OPERATIVES OPERATING IN A MOST ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONTEXT, THE UK CAPITALIST MARKET ECONOMY. THE STUDY EXPLORES COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING AND THE PERSONAL INVESTMENT AS TWO IMPORTANT POLITICAL ASPECTS. WORKPLACE DEMOCRACY AND THE PERSONAL ARE INTERLINKED PARADIGMS FOR POLITICAL PRAXIS - AS PRACTICED DEMOCRACY, IMMANENT CRITIQUE OF THE HEGEMONIC CORPORATE WAY OF ORGANISING WORK, AS WELL AS PREFIGURING A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. TAKING THE PERSPECTIVE OF RADICAL WORKER CO-OPERATIVES, THIS ARTICLE CATERS TO AN URGENTLY NEEDED CONCEPTUALISATION OF RADICAL DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP AT WORK.
819	PURPOSE: THE INVESTIGATION IS AIMED AT DETERMINING THE MITIGATION AND CORRECTION MEASURES USED BY THE STATE TO REMEDY THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY MINING COMPANIES IN THE EL OASIS NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF CERTEGUI, DEPARTMENT OF CHOC& TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROVISIONS OF LAW 99 OF 1993 AND OF LAW 70 OF 1993 (BLACK COMMUNITIES ACT), ARTICLE 29. METHODOLOGY: A PROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS IS MADE TO KNOW IN DETAIL THE EFFECTS OF THE MINING ACTIVITY IN THE EL OASIS NEIGHBORHOOD. THE LAWS THAT ARE PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO CLARIFY THE COMPLIANCE OF THE STATE IN THE AREAS THAT ARE FAR AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF CERTEGUI. FINDINGS: AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, THERE ARE SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN FACING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, MATERIALIZED IN THE ADOPTION OF MORE SUITABLE PERSONNEL. THIS IS BECAUSE UNIVERSITIES ARE JUST BEGINNING TO TRAIN IN SPECIALIZATIONS AND UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS AGRARIAN LAW OR LAND LAW, AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION IS IN FULL ACADEMIC RECOGNITION THAT MANAGES AND PROMOTES PUBLIC POLICIES BASED ON SOIL SUSTAINABILITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A LACK OF CONTROL OF THE DAMAGES PRODUCED BY MINING COMPANIES. CONCLUSIONS: TO DATE, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DID NOT EXPRESS THE NORMATIVE SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT OF BIOCULTURAL RIGHTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT, IN THE INTERNAL LAW, THIS ANTECEDENT DOES EXIST, WHICH IS AN EVENT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE ECOLOGICAL REVOLUTION.
820	HONG KONG HAS BEEN THE LABORATORY OF AN EXTRAORDINARY CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERIMENT. CHINA'S "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" MODEL FOR HONG KONG SEEKS TO PRESERVE A COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW TRADITION WITHIN A SOCIALIST PARTY-STATE, AN AMBITION THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED. THE EXPERIMENT HAS NOT GONE SMOOTHLY, GIVEN THE ACUTE IDEOLOGICAL TENSIONS BETWEEN PRO-DEMOCRACY FORCES IN HONG KONG AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, BUT FOR DECADES HONG KONG ENJOYED THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSIDERABLE FREEDOMS WHILE BEING FIRMLY UNDER CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY.1 THE STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE OF HONG KONG'S LIBERAL RULE OF LAW WAS LARGELY OWING TO THE STURDY GROUNDWORK LAID SINCE 1984 - THE YEAR IN WHICH THE SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION ON THE QUESTION OF HONG KONG WAS SIGNED - IN THE YEARS RUNNING UP TO THE 1997 HANDOVER AND THE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT GROUNDWORK IN THE POST-HANDOVER YEARS. INDEED, TAKING THE LONG VIEW, THE PERIOD SPANNING ROUGHLY THE TEN YEARS PRIOR TO THE HANDOVER UP TO 2019 CAN PROBABLY BE CONSIDERED ONE ERA IN HONG KONG'S CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY - A HOPEFUL, AND AT TIMES THRIVING, ERA FOR THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW. ERAS DO NOT COME FROM NOWHERE; THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED. THIS FESTSCHRIFT PAYS TRIBUTE TO THE WORK OF PROFESSOR JOHANNES CHAN SC (HON), A KEY ARCHITECT OF HONG KONG'S LIBERAL COMMON LAW SYSTEM. JOHANNES IS REMARKABLE NOT ONLY FOR THE EXTENT OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BUILDING THE SYSTEM, BUT ALSO FOR THE BROAD RANGE OF HIS CAPACITIES. IN THE NEARLY FOUR DECADES OF HIS ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER SPANNING THE YEARS OF (WHAT WAS IN HINDSIGHT) A BRIGHT ERA FOR HONG KONG'S LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, HE WAS A LEGAL SCHOLAR, A TEACHER, A BARRISTER, THE DEAN OF A LAW SCHOOL, A LEADER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL. IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO FIND ANYONE ELSE WHO
821	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE GOVERNANCE OF THE SECURITY SECTOR IN SITUATIONS OF ARMED CONFLICT, AND THE ROLE OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN CONFLICT MANAGEMENT. SPECIFICALLY, IT SEEKS TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE SECURITY SECTOR HAS HELPED TO ADVANCE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES IN MINDANAO, OR WHETHER ITS ACTIVITIES HAVE AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION. USING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA, THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE CORE SECURITY SECTOR - THE ARMED FORCES, THE POLICE, AND ALSO THE AUXILIARY FORCES, THE USE OF WHICH WAS EXPANDED DURING THE ARROYO ADMINISTRATION. BEYOND THAT, IT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF THE CIVILIAN ACTORS, PARTICULARLY CLANS AND ELECTED POLITICIANS WITH AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS OVER ARMED UNITS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE LINK BETWEEN GOOD SECURITY SECTOR GOVERNANCE AND CONFLICT PREVENTION USING MAGUINDANAO, A PROVINCE IN MINDANAO IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES, AS A CASE STUDY WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE 2009 MAGUINDANAO MASSACRE.
822	THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE KEY CONCLUSIONS OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE. IT ANALYSES THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES AT THE MAIN STAGES OF THE IMPLEMENTED JUDICIAL REFORM AND HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PROPER ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIARY. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ECTHR, WHICH ENSHRINE LEGAL POSITIONS ON ISSUES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EFFECTIVE JUSTICE: THE INADMISSIBILITY OF THE USE OF INDEPENDENCE GUARANTEES OF JUDGES TO AVOID LEGAL LIABILITY; THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE INSTITUTION OF THE JURY; AND BALANCED AND STRATEGIC PLANNING OF FURTHER REFORMS IN THE FIELD OF JUSTICE.
823	ON 20 MAY 2019, THE AD HOC OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP APPOINTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS TO STUDY THE FUTURE NEGOTIATION PROCESS OF A GLOBAL PACT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, GAVE A TURN TO THE NEGOTIATIONS POSTPONING SEVERAL YEARS ITS OUTCOME AND RENOUNCING TO ITS CONVENTIONAL NATURE. THE CHANGE OF COURSE THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED ALSO AFFECTS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSAL OF THE PACT PRESENTED BY FRANCE THAT PURSUED THE ADOPTION OF A GENERAL TREATY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE FRENCH PROPOSAL HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE TEXT PREPARED BY THE "CLUB DE JURISTES" -A NON-STATE ACADEMIC ACTOR-, WHICH AFTER BEING ENDORSED BY FRANCE HAD BECOME THE SOFT LAW INSTRUMENT THAT TRIGGERED THE ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION 72/277 OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. ITS ULTIMATE GOAL WAS TO CODIFY THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND RECOGNIZE THIRD-GENERATION RIGHTS THAT WOULD ALLOW CIVIL SOCIETY TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. IN THE NEW VISION OF THE PACT, THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION IS ON IMPROVING THE APPLICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, A GOAL THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH THE ADOPTION OF A DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES RESPECTFUL OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF STATES IN 2022 COINCIDING WITH THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STOCKHOLM DECLARATION ON THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENT.
824	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE IDEA, BOTH IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, OF DEFINING TERRORISM. USING SECTION 1 OF THE UK'S TERRORISM ACT 2000 AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SINGLE DEFINITION OF TERRORISM IS INVARIABLY BROAD OWING TO THE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. THIS IS DAMAGING TO THE 'PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY' AS RECOGNIZED IN BRITISH PUBLIC LAW AND THE ECHR. MOREOVER, THIS PROBLEM IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE INCREASING APPLICATION OF COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION TO NON-INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICTS. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE SUGGESTS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION: MULTIPLE DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM WHOSE BREADTH IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH THEY ARE DESIGNED. FEARS THAT SUCH AN APPROACH MAY AMOUNT TO AN 'EXPRESSION OF INCONSISTENCY' WILL BE ADDRESSED BY ARGUING THAT LAW'S CAPACITY TO SHAPE AND FRAME PUBLIC AND POLITICAL DEBATE ON THE CONCEPT OF TERRORISM IS OVER-EXAGGERATED. LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM THEREFORE SHOULD REMAIN PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE LEGAL RATHER THAN POLITICAL FUNCTION OF DEFINING TERRORISM.
825	THIS ARTICLE DELVES INTO THE MULTIFACETED LANDSCAPE OF STATE POLICY SOURCES IN UKRAINE, EXAMINING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN LEGAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS. DRAWING INSIGHTS FROM POST-SOVIET SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, THE STUDY IDENTIFIES FOUR CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES THAT FRAME THE UNDERSTANDING OF STATE POLICY SOURCES: LEGAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL. AS THE 21ST CENTURY UNFOLDS, MARKED BY INFORMATION PROGRESS, GLOBALIZATION, AND EVOLVING NOTIONS OF STATEHOOD, THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN SCHOLARS, THINKERS, AND POLITICAL PRACTICES ON THE UKRAINIAN DOCTRINE OF STATE POLICY BECOMES EVIDENT. THE DISCOURSE AROUND STATE POLICY SOURCES IS CHARACTERIZED BY NUANCED DEBATES ABOUT THE DOMINANCE OF LEGAL VERSUS POLITICAL ACTS, THE ROLE OF POLITICAL WILL, AND THE EVOLVING NATURE OF POLICY FORMULATION IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA. THE ARTICLE UNDERSCORES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN LEGAL FOUNDATIONS AND POLITICAL INTENTIONS IN STATE POLICY FORMULATION. WHILE RECOGNIZING THE COMPLEXITIES INHERENT IN EACH APPROACH, IT ARGUES FOR A COHESIVE FRAMEWORK THAT INTEGRATES LEGAL NORMS, POLITICAL INTENTIONS, ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS, AND SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVES TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE STATE POLICIES. THE EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OF STATE POLICY SOURCES IN UKRAINE SERVES AS A TESTAMENT TO THE INTRICATE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TRADITIONAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND THE EVOLVING FORCES OF THE MODERN WORLD.
826	APUNCAC IS A DRAFT INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION, STRENGTHENING UNCAC'S PROVISIONS AND ADDING MECHANISMS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. 'CORRUPTION' INCLUDES PUBLIC OFFICIALS ABUSING THEIR POWERS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES AN ESPECIALLY INSIDIOUS FORM: WHEN LAWS ARE CREATED AND APPLIED TO DENY EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. RULING ELITES CONTROL THE EXECUTIVE AND PARLIAMENT, TO PASS LAWS THAT SELECTIVELY TARGET AND DISADVANTAGE A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. OUR EMPIRICAL DATA COMES FROM A HISTORICAL CASE, MASSIVE GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED WAGE THEFT FROM WESTERN AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINAL WORKERS BETWEEN 1901 AND 1972. WE USE THESE DATA TO ANALYSE HOW THIS KIND OF CORRUPTION WORKS IN PRACTICE, TO EVALUATE APUNCAC'S MEASURES AND STRATEGIES, TO SEE WHAT SPECIFIC MEASURES MIGHT BE USED OR MODIFIED, AND WHERE APUNCAC MIGHT NEED SUPPLEMENTING. WE ARGUE THAT ARTICLE 4(3) COULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT, ESPECIALLY SUPPORTED BY OTHER ARTICLES AND PROCESSES, SUCH AS DEDICATED INDEPENDENT COURTS AND STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL COURTS. WE EVALUATE TWO SCENARIOS: THE FIRST SCENARIO IS PROSPECTIVE, ASSUMING THAT APUNCAC IS ADOPTED. WE EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF APUNCAC IN DETERRING FUTURE CORRUPTION INVOLVING SELECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE LAW. THE SECOND SCENARIO IS RETROSPECTIVE. WE EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE SUPPORT THAT APUNCAC MIGHT PROVIDE REGARDING COURT ACTIONS THAT SEEK REDRESS FOR POTENTIAL LITIGANTS, SUCH AS WA ABORIGINAL PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED IN THE PAST.
827	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PROBLEM OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN LAW IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE NORMS RELATED TO DRUG SMUGGLING. IT IS PROPOSED TO CONSIDER THE PREVENTION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OFFENSES RELATED TO DRUG SMUGGLING THROUGH THE HARMONIZATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE INTERACTION OF INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC NORMS OF PROCEDURAL LAW. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SYSTEM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORMS OF LAW, ON WHICH THE EFFECTIVE ACHIEVEMENT OF GOALS IN THE SUPPRESSION OF CRIME IN THE SPHERE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING DEPENDS. BASED ON THE STUDY OF THE MATERIAL, IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT THE MECHANISM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORMS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IS NOT QUITE SIMPLE: ON THE ONE HAND, THE APPEAL TO FOREIGN LEGAL NORMS IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEORIES ARE MODELED ON THE DAMAGE TO ONE'S OWN LEGAL SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF UNJUSTIFIED BORROWINGS FROM OTHER LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS CAN BE USED IN THE PRACTICAL ACTIVITIES OF CUSTOMS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
828	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ENIGMATIC. BROADLY SPEAKING, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT LEGAL MECHANISMS FOR SOCIAL CONTROL (OR 'INSTITUTIONS', TO USE NORTH'S WORDS) PLAY A MAJOR ROLE. NEVERTHELESS, THE IMPACT OF LEGAL ORGANIZATION ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. DESPITE THE PROGRESS ATTAINED BY MAJOR STUDIES IN RECENT YEARS, THEY HAVE NOT DEFINITIVELY RESOLVED WHETHER LAW IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, OR RATHER A SUPPORTING ELEMENT THEREOF, MUCH LESS WHETHER A PARTICULAR LEGAL SYSTEM IS NECESSARILY AND UNIVERSALLY OPTIMAL. THE FAILURE OF COLLECTIVIZATION IS EVIDENT. HOWEVER, THE OPEN MARKET MODEL HAS MULTIPLE VARIANTS OF THE STATE'S ROLE AND THE DEGREES OF REGULATION. A FIRST APPROXIMATION CHALLENGING THE RELEVANCE OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THIS TOPIC NOTES THE FREQUENT CONFUSION BETWEEN LEGAL SYSTEM, LEGAL RULE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC ORGANIZATION, POLITICAL SYSTEM, SUBSTANTIVE LAW, AND LEGAL PRACTICE. THE CONFUSION PRODUCES UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION. THE DOING BUSINESS REPORTS ASPIRE TO MEASURE THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS IN A COUNTRY, WITHIN ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO THE OFT-ADVANCED IDEA, THIS APPROACH INVOLVES AN ASSESSMENT, NOT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WITHIN ITS FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION BUT RATHER OF PUBLIC POLICIES AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. IN THIS REGARD, HASTY CONCLUSIONS RECOGNIZING A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EASE OF DOING BUSINESS AND MEMBERSHIP IN A PARTICULAR LEGAL FAMILY ARE OF DUBIOUS VALIDITY. EVALUATING LEGAL SYSTEMS PER SE REQUIRES AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPER APPLICABILITY OF RULES THAT FALL WITHIN THE CORPUS OF THE LAW, THE PREDICTABILITY OF LEGAL SOLUTIONS AND THE SUBSTANTIVE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS RECOGNIZED BY LEGAL RULES. THIS APPROACH PERFORCE RAISES THE QUESTION OF LEGAL CERTAINTY. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEX OF LEGAL CERTAINTY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO AN ANALYSIS OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC, WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTE OF THE LAW IN VARIOUS NATIONAL SYSTEMS AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORMS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES RATIONALES FOR A LEGAL CERTAINTY INDEX.
829	THIS ARTICLE IS THE RESULT OF A RESEARCH PROJECT COMPLETED BY THE AUTHOR IN 2012. IT FOCUSES ON THE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY OF THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SPENDING, THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE EVOLUTION OF LEGISLATION, JURISPRUDENCE AND DOCTRINE, INCLUDING AN EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW OF COMPARATIVE LAW AND OBSERVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SPENDING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SANTANDER. THE METHODOLOGY DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR DIEGO LOPEZ IN THE BOOK "THE RIGHT OF JUDGES" IS USED TO MAKE THE JURISPRUDENTIAL ANALYSIS, PRESENTING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: IS THERE A DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SPENDING IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THAT CAN CLARIFY THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CONCEPT EXPRESSED IN THE LETTER? IS THERE A DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SPENDING IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THAT CAN BROADEN THE CONCEPT EXPRESSED IN THE LETTER AND CLARIFY THE UNCERTAINTY GENERATED THROUGH THE ART. 41 OF THE EOP? IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IN THE NATIONAL CONTEXT, THE CONCEPT IS UNCERTAIN, UNKNOWING THE INTENSION OF THE FIRST CONSTITUENT AND, IN THE LOCAL CONTEXT, THE EXISTENCE OF A CONSIDERABLE MARGIN OF DISCRETIONALITY FROM THE ADMINISTRATION REGARDING ITS APPLICATION WAS OBSERVED.
830	DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MANY GOVERNMENTS ESTABLISHED IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. DUE TO A RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE RIGHT TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, RELIGION WAS PLACED IN THE CATEGORY OF "NON-ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY" AND WAS, THEREFORE, UNPROTECTED. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, THIS PAPER TRIES TO OFFER A REFLECTION ON THE RELEVANCE OF THE DUAL NATURE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS AN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE RIGHT, SINCE THE CURRENT CRISIS HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DIMENSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS VULNERABLE WHEN THE LEGAL MODEL DOES NOT OFFER AN ADEQUATE INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE TO THE COLLECTIVE DIMENSION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
831	THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE RESULTS OF POLICE REFORM IN THREE POST-YUGOSLAV STATES THAT VARY IN TERMS OF LOCAL OWNERSHIP. USING SURVEY, FOCUS GROUP, AND INTERVIEW DATA GATHERED IN KOSOVO, SERBIA, AND MACEDONIA, WE FIND THAT THE PUBLIC PERCEIVES THE POLICE FORCE CREATED AND TRAINED BY INTERNATIONAL OVERSIGHT AS MORE CAPABLE AND LEGITIMATE WHEN COMPARED TO POLICE FORCES THAT GREW UNDER LOCAL OWNERSHIP. INSULATION FROM POLITICAL AND SOCIETAL INFLUENCE LED TO A MORE CAPABLE AND LEGITIMATE POLICE FORCE IN KOSOVO, WHILE THE POLITICIZATION OF THE POLICE FORCE UNDER LOCAL OWNERSHIP UNDERMINED ITS CAPACITY AND LEGITIMACY IN MACEDONIA AND SERBIA.
832	IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT A LACK OF DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AMONG YOUNGSTERS, MANY GOVERNMENTS INTENSIFY THEIR EFFORTS TO STIMULATE DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AND REDUCE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN ADVANTAGED AND DISADVANTAGED ADOLESCENTS. ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY TRY TO DO THIS IS BY ON-SITE CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE INCLUDE VISITS TO A GOVERNMENT INSTITUTION, INTERACTION WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE REENACTMENT OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. YET, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS ACTUALLY BOOST DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT AND COMPENSATE INEQUALITIES IN DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF ON-SITE CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION ON (INEQUALITIES IN) DEMOCRATIC ENGAGEMENT. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT POTENTIAL EFFECTS ARE TRULY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ON-SITE CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM, I ISOLATE THE HYPOTHESIZED CAUSAL EFFECTS BY EMPLOYING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE ESTIMATION, REDUCING SELECTION EFFECTS, AND CONTROLLING FOR PRE-TEST SENSITIZATION AND TIME PERIOD. MOREOVER, I ASSESSED WHETHER THE EFFECTS LAST OVER THE COURSE OF A SCHOOL YEAR. THE NEWLY COLLECTED DATA CONSIST OF FOUR WAVES AMONG 585 STUDENTS IN THIRTY CLASSES AND THREE SCHOOLS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF ON-SITE CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION NEED TO BE TEMPERED: THE MAIN DUTCH ON-SITE CITIZENSHIP PROGRAM HAS A ROBUST AND LASTING EFFECT ON POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE, BUT NOT ON POLITICAL ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS. MOREOVER, THE PROGRAM GENERALLY DOES NOT REDUCE PRE-EXISTING INEQUALITIES.
833	THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON 11 MARCH, 2020. SERBIA DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY (SOE) ON 15 MARCH, JUST DAYS AFTER THE COUNTRY'S FIRST OFFICIAL CASE, PART OF AN UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL WAVE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSES, WITH STATES REACTING DIFFERENTLY TO THE THREAT OF THE VIRUS. DECISION MAKERS IN SERBIA OPTED TO DECLARE A SOE, FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DECREES AND MINISTERIAL ORDERS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE SERBIAN GOVERNMENT'S INITIAL RESPONSE. THE LEGISLATION IN FORCE IN MARCH 2020 IS ANALYSED TO EXPLORE WHAT POSSIBILITIES AND INSTRUMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN USED, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON LEGISLATION REGARDING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND DISASTER RESPONSES, WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE DECLARATION OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF LEGITIMATE RESTRICTIONS TO FIGHT THE OUTBREAK. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE FULL POTENTIAL OF ALL AVAILABLE MEASURES AND INSTRUMENTS WAS NOT EXHAUSTED, ESPECIALLY REGARDING LEGISLATION RELATING TO AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.
834	THE PASSIVE FORM OF EUTHANASIA IS LEGALIZED ALMOST IN EVERY CIVILIZED COUNTRY. ITS ACTIVE FORM IS NOT A GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL INSTITUTION. IN EUROPE, ACTIVE EUTHANASIA IS LEGALIZED ONLY IN THE NETHERLANDS, BELGIUM, LUXEMBOURG AND SWITZERLAND. IN AUSTRALIA, THE ACT ON THE RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL OF 1995 LEGALIZED THE INSTITUTION OF ASSISTED SUICIDE, WHICH IS NOT IDENTICAL TO ACTIVE EUTHANASIA. THE DIFFERENCE LIES IN THE FACT THAT LEGALIZED ACTIVE EUTHANASIA MEANS THAT THE AUTHOR OF A MURDER IS NOT PUNISHABLE (UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES), WHILST ASSISTED SUICIDE IS NOT ABOUT MURDER, RATHER ABOUT SUICIDE. IN THE FIRST CASE, THE PATIENT IS KILLED ON HIS OR HER REQUEST BY SOMEONE ELSE. IN THE SECOND CASE, THE PATIENT HIMSELF OR HERSELF EXECUTES THE ACT OF SELF-KILLING (BY THE ASSISTANCE OF A HEALTHCARE WORKER). IN AUSTRALIA, THE INSTITUTION OF ASSISTED SUICIDE WAS REPEALED IN 1997. ASSISTED SUICIDE IS LEGAL IN FOUR USA MEMBER STATES: IN VERMONT, WASHINGTON, MONTANA AND OREGON. IN URUGUAY, THE ACTIVE FORM OF EUTHANASIA HAS BEEN LEGAL SINCE 1932.
835	WIDESPREAD MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION IN SOCIETY, ACCELERATED BY COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA, CONSTITUTE AN ASSAULT ON TRUTH ITSELF. TO PREPARE STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE THIS TREACHEROUS NEW TERRAIN, SCHOOLS CAN STRIVE TO BUILD A CULTURE OF EVIDENCE. STUDENTS AND CITIZENS IN A CULTURE OF EVIDENCE SHARE A COMMITMENT TO TRUTH, ARE OPEN TO CHANGING THEIR MINDS, MAINTAIN A SKEPTICAL MINDSET, AND ASK FOR EVIDENCE FOR PROBLEMATIC CLAIMS. THE SIMPLE ACT OF ASKING 'HOW DO WE KNOW?' CAN BECOME A HABIT, ONE THAT ATTENDS TO THE QUALITY OF SOURCES AND EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTATION. ESTABLISHING TRUTHS-RATHER THAN TRANSMITTING THEM-PRODUCES A MORE SOPHISTICATED AND NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF KNOWLEDGE AND HOW IT IS PRODUCED. IF TRADITIONAL SCHOOLING WAS FOCUSED UPON TRANSMITTING MASSES OF ESTABLISHED TRUTHS, INQUIRY-BASED APPROACHES REVEAL THE HIDDEN PROCESS OF HOW THOSE TRUTHS WERE ESTABLISHED. ANY FIELD CAN BENEFIT FROM INCORPORATING MORE OF ITS HISTORY INTO ITS CONTENTS. STUDENTS LEARN THAT A GIVEN DOMAIN OF KNOWLEDGE WASN'T ALWAYS SO CLEAR, SIMPLE AND SELF-EVIDENT, BUT WAS THE PRODUCT OF CONFLICT AND CONFUSION AND RESEARCH OVER TIME. THIS MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD BETTER PREPARE CITIZENS FOR THE SHIFTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM RESEARCHERS AND EXPERTS DURING THE PANDEMIC, FOR EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION, SCHOOLING SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND ARE TRYING TO DISCOVER, RATHER THAN JUST WHAT IS KNOWN. ATTENTION TO ONGOING RESEARCH IN MOST FIELDS CAN UNSETTLE THE PERCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE AS OVERLY FIXED AND PERMANENT.
836	THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT CONTEMPORARY ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE BRAZILIAN STATE, FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE CONFLICT BETWEEN FREEDOM AND LEGAL CERTAINTY, AND HOW THIS TENSION SHOWS ITSELF IN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL GUIDELINES FOR THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT STATE, LATER STATE OF LAW, AND THE CURRENT REPERCUSSIONS ON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE ROLES ASSIGNED AMONGST STATE AND FREE ENTERPRISE.
837	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CAMEROON'S APPROACH TO JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOCUSING ON ITS POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE EXECUTIVE. THE ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE JUDICIARY IN CAMEROON IS EXCESSIVELY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE EXECUTIVE, A POSITION WHICH HAS RESULTED TO THE ABSENCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. IT ALSO CONTENDS THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IS NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY AND TO REFORM THE INSTITUTIONS OF JUDICIAL INSULATION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE BALANCE BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
838	PROMPTED BY GRINDLE'S IDENTIFICATION OF A NEXT-STEPS APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE USES THE EXPERIENCE OF MOGADISHU'S POLICE FORCE TO CONSIDER THE MINIMAL CONDITIONS OF GOVERNANCE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS DEVELOPMENT-RELATED CHALLENGES. AT ONE LEVEL, THE INTRODUCTION OF DEVELOPMENT-ORIENTED GOVERNANCE IS OBSTRUCTED BY THE INABILITY OF INTERNATIONAL ACTORS TO INFLUENCE LOCAL POWER BROKERS OR MITIGATE THE DISTRUST AND INSECURITY AFFECTING DAILY LIFE IN A CITY SUCH AS MOGADISHU. MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, THE CAPACITY OF AN APPROACH PREDICATED ON CONTEXTUALLY-BASED ANALYTICS IS LIMITED BY ITS ADVOCATES' UNDERSTANDING GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT IN TECHNICAL TERMS ALIGNED TO LIBERAL GOALS, RATHER THAN AS ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES RELIANT ON NEGOTIATION AND TRUST-BASED RELATIONSHIPS. IN PRACTICE, MINIMAL GOVERNANCE HAS MORE TO DO WITH THE STABILITY NEEDED FOR PEOPLE TO GO ABOUT THEIR EVERYDAY BUSINESS IN RELATIVE SAFETY THAN WITH DEMOCRACY OR POVERTY REDUCTION. FOR SUCH REASONS, THE NEW DIAGNOSTICS IS A REFINEMENT OF EXISTING APPROACHES, RATHER THAN A SIGNIFICANT ANALYTICAL ADVANCE.
839	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ANALYSE THE SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY (SA) MECHANISMS THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ESTABLISHED IN CAMBODIA. THESE INITIATIVES TAKE PLACE IN A SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT MARKED BY PERVASIVE NEO-PATRIMONIAL STRUCTURES. OUR FOCUS IS ON THE STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED BY STATE ACTORS, CSOS AND ORDINARY CITIZENS (MEDIATED BY NEO-PATRIMONIAL STRUCTURES) - STRATEGIES THAT DEMONSTRATE A NEO-PATRIMONIAL TRAP INTO WHICH SA INITIATIVES HAVE FALLEN, WHEREBY OFFICIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY LINES HAVE BEEN UNDERMINED. THESE STRATEGIES ARE: TO FOCUS SA ACTIVITIES ON LOCAL LEVEL AUTHORITIES WHO HAVE NO MEANS OR POWER TO INTRODUCE CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE OR TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES, AND TO ALLOW SA PRACTICES TO EMERGE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO NOT THREATEN ACTUAL AUTHORITARIAN DISTRIBUTION OF POWER, NORMS AND PRACTICES OF CLIENTELISTIC EXCHANGE, AND THE BENEFITS OBTAINED THROUGH PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONS. AS A RESULT, CITIZENS HAVE NOT BEEN EMPOWERED TO DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY BUT, PARADOXICALLY, HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO TAKE OVER SOME GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS, IN TURN, STRENGTHENS THE NETWORKS OF CLIENTELISM AND PATRONAGE. THESE INSIGHTS INDICATE THE WEAK POTENTIAL OF EXTERNALLY-IMPOSED SA MECHANISMS IN AN AUTHORITARIAN AND NEO-PATRIMONIAL SETTING IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY PARTLY COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING ACCOUNTABILITY. THE FINDINGS ARE BASED ON A TWO-YEAR STUDY CONDUCTED USING A COMBINATION OF QUALITATIVE SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS AND AN ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH.
840	WE DESCRIBE AND PUT FORWARD AN EGALITARIAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM FOR THE SPANISH CONGRESS OF DEPUTIES, WHICH, IN CONTRAST TO THE PROPOSALS SUBMITTED UP TO THE PRESENT DAY, WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE CONSTITUTION TO BE AMENDED. THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION ON WHICH IT IS BASED COULD ALSO BE APPLIED TO OTHER DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS.
841	THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE LITERATURE THAT HAS INVESTIGATED FIRMS' READINESS TO CONFRONT COMPETITION FROM INFORMAL (UNREGISTERED) FIRMS BY RESPONDING THROUGH INTENSIFIED PRODUCT INNOVATION ACTIVITIES. DRAWING ON THE BOUNDED RATIONALITY PERSPECTIVE, WE UNRAVEL NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREAT FROM INFORMAL COMPETITORS AND PRODUCT INNOVATION BY IDENTIFYING TWO EXTERNAL CONTINGENCIES (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND REGULATORY QUALITY) AND TWO INTERNAL CONTINGENCIES (EXPORT INTENSITY AND TOP MANAGER'S SECTOR EXPERIENCE). IN THIS WAY, THE STUDY ACKNOWLEDGES THE IMMENSE DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST ACROSS DEVELOPING MARKETS, FOCUSING ON POST COMMUNIST SOCIETIES CHARACTERIZED WITH A MEDIUM LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, LIMITED MARKET SIZE, AND WEAK INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AN EMPIRICAL PROTOTYPE OF THIS TYPE OF CONTEXT IS EXEMPLIFIED IN EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. THEREFORE, OUR MODEL ESTIMATES THE EFFECT OF THE THREAT FROM INFORMAL COMPETITORS ON PRODUCT INNOVATION BY TESTING FIRM-LEVEL DATA FROM FIVE COUNTRIES WITH EU CANDIDATE STATUS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT DIRECT AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREAT FROM INFORMAL COMPETITORS AND PRODUCT INNOVATION IS STRENGTHENED WHEN: 1) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION IS WEAKER, 2) REGULATORY QUALITY IS HIGHER, 3) THE FIRM IS AN INTESIVE EXPORTER, AND 4) THE FIRM'S TOP MANAGERS HAVE LESS EXPERIENCE.
842	WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE POLITICAL BASIS FOR ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND CONSTRUCTED OUR OWN VARIABLES OF POLITICAL REGIMES' CLASSIFICATION FOR THE YEARS 1820-2000. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN DEMOCRACY INDICATORS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS REQUIRES, FIRST AND FOREMOST, DUE GUARANTEES FOR PERSONAL IMMUNITY. DISCRETIONARY ARRESTS AND PROPERTY SEIZURES UNDERMINE ANY FORMAL GUARANTEES OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, LOW TAXATION BENEFITS, ETC. PERSONAL IMMUNITY SHOULD BE DEFENDED EVEN FOR "UNPLEASANT" PERSONS OR FOR THE POSSIBLE POLITICAL OPPONENTS OF THE COUNTRY'S RULER.
843	THE THIRD SECTION OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE AS GUARANTOR OF THE PROCESSES THAT SEEK DIRECT REPARATION OF THE VICTIMS THAT DEMANDS THAT THEY BE REPAIRED AND THAT IT BE DECLARED THAT AN UNLAWFUL DAMAGE WAS PRESENTED EITHER BY THE DIRECT ACTION OR POSSIBLE OMISSION OF STATE ENTITIES. THAT IS WHY SAID ENTITY HAS RAISED AND DEVELOPED A SERIES OF PRESUMPTIONS, WHICH HAVE SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR GRANTING AND LIQUIDATING, AND IN SOME CASES, FOR DENYING THE RECOGNITION OF ALLEGED DAMAGES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A PRESENTATION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS RAISED AND DEVELOPED BY THE COUNCIL OF STATE IN ORDER TO ANALYZE EACH ONE OF THEM, IN ORDER TO VERIFY IF THEY CONSTITUTE TRUE SUCCESSES IN FAVOR OF COMPREHENSIVE REPARATION AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF A EFFICIENT JUSTICE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, OR IF THEY REPRESENT AN ABSURDITY IN THE FACE OF SAID IDEALS.
844	'AN OCEAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE' IS AN IDEA THAT WAS PROPOSED BY CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING IN APRIL 2019. THIS IS A POLITICAL PROPOSAL WHICH NEEDS FURTHER INTERPRETATION: WHAT IS ITS LEGAL BASIS; WHAT ARE ITS MAIN CONTENTS; HOW CAN THIS PROPOSAL BE IMPLEMENTED? IN LIGHT OF THESE QUESTIONS, THIS FORUM STUDIES RELATED THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES. THE PROPOSAL OF, 'AN OCEAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE' PROVIDES A NEW IDEA FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL OCEAN GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING CHINA, SHOULD ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF BUILDING CONSENSUS AND BUILD A SENSE OF, 'AN OCEAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE', WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES, AS WELL AS INITIATING MORE PRACTICAL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL COOPERATION, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE RESILIENT COMMON DEVELOPMENT. THIS CONFERENCE REPORT SUMMARISES THE CORE ISSUES DISCUSSED DURING THE CONFERENCE, WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESSENCE OF THE MEETING.
845	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE CAPACITY OF THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONS AND GOVERNANCE TO COUNTERACT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE SHORTFALL. IT ARGUES THAT THE TANGIBLE IMPACT OF THE TREATY ON THE STATES' PRACTICE HAS BEEN LIMITED BY VARIOUS ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS FACTORS. THE FORMER ARE IDENTIFIED AS DIRECTLY LINKED TO CONTENT OF THE DOCUMENT AND REFER TO THE ACCURACY OF THE DRAFTING. THE LATTER ARE ROOTED OUTSIDE THE TEXT AND BEYOND THE CHARACTER OF THE CHARTER AND INCLUDE ISSUES RELATING TO THE STATES' RELUCTANCE TO RATIFY THE DOCUMENT, CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS UNDERMINING IMPLEMENTATION ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND THE WEAK INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES OF ENFORCEMENT.
846	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICS AS MANIFEST IN THE PRACTICE OF 'STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRACY'. BY GLANCING BACK TO DEBATES ABOUT CITIZENSHIP AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BETWEEN THE TWO WORLD WARS, IT SETS CONTEMPORARY CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLITICAL CONSTITUTION IN BROADER CONTEXT. IN DOING SO, IT DISCLOSES A FUNDAMENTAL DIVISION BETWEEN CONCEPTIONS OF THE STATE DERIVED FROM ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE ON THE ONE HAND, AND ANCIENT ATHENIAN POLITICAL PRACTICE ON THE OTHER. IT FINDS IN THE TRAGIC DILEMMAS POSED FOR STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRATS-BY THE COMPETING CLAIMS ON THEIR VALUES-A TEST OF INDIVIDUAL MORAL AGENCY AND OF DEMOCRACY AS THE MANAGEMENT OF DIVERSITY. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN OUR ESTIMATION OF STREET-LEVEL BUREAUCRACY IS NOT SO MUCH THE PURITY OF THE 'JUDICIAL MIND' AS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE 'DEMOCRATIC SOUL' AND THE 'CONNECTED SOCIETY'.
847	THE INCORPORATION OF AGENCIES INTO COLOMBIA'S ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE HAS GENERATED PROFOUND DEBATES ABOUT THE NEED TO CREATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES THAT DIFFER FROM TRADITIONAL ONES. SUCH INCORPORATION IS ALL THE MORE PROBLEMATIC WHEN THESE NORTH AMERICAN AGENCIES ARE INTRODUCED WITHOUT ANY REAL ANALYSIS OF THE LOCAL TRADITION AND CULTURE. THE SITUATION BECAME MORE COMPLICATED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNDISPUTED FACT THAT THE VALUES AND PHILOSOPHIES OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION STRUCTURE IN COLOMBIA ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE PREDOMINANT VALUES IN THE UNITED STATES. HENCE, THIS PAPER PROVIDES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INSTITUTION AND OF ITS CREDULOUS AND IMPULSIVE ADOPTION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS INTO OUR REALITY.
848	POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES' PROCESSES ON THEIR WAY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE EXTENSIVELY PROCEEDED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THEIR TRANSITION FROM COMMUNISM TO DEMOCRACY. THE REGIME CHANGE LED TO A PROCESS OF "COMING TO TERMS WITH THE PAST" IN THE SENSE THAT THESE COUNTRIES TOOK TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MEASURES FOR THE CRIMES AND PRACTICES OF THE FORMER AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. IN THIS REGARD, ALBANIA IS A CASE WORTH CONSIDERING AS A PART OF THE CURRENT EU ENLARGEMENT AGENDA. AS A COUNTRY THAT WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE ETHNIC WARS BETWEEN THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIAN COUNTRIES, ALBANIA EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENT HISTORICAL PACE OF A COMMUNIST PAST WITH ITS PECULIARITIES. THIS ARTICLE MAINLY AIMS TO ANALYSE ALBANIA'S COMING TO TERMS WITH ITS COMMUNIST PAST AND THUS THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED IN ITS EU PROCESS. THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THE ARTICLE IS TWOFOLD: FIRST, EU IMPACT WAS LIMITED WHEN ALBANIA STARTED ITS TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PERIOD IN THE 1990S. THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT PROGRESS IN THE EU PROCESS OF ALBANIA IN TERMS OF EU CANDIDACY WAS ENHANCED IN THE 2000S AND THE IMPACT OF THE STRICT EU CONDITIONALITY BECAME EVIDENT IN THESE YEARS AS WELL. SECONDLY, THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IN WHICH THE RIVALRY BETWEEN RUSSIA AS WELL AS CHINA, AND THE WEST IS AT ITS PEAK IN THE SO-CALLED WESTERN BALKANS REGION, COULD ALLOW ALBANIA TO BE MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE EU, WHICH IN TURN MAY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR DEEPER REFORMS TO COME TO TERMS WITH ITS PAST.
849	ALTHOUGH KYRGYZSTAN HAS RECENTLY WITHSTOOD TWO COUP D'ETATS (OR SO-CALLED "REVOLUTIONS") AND A BOUT OF ETHNIC VIOLENCE, THE POLITICIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BY SUCCESSIVE PRESIDENTS PORTENDS A TROUBLESOME FUTURE. THE 2017 TRANSITION FROM ALMAZBEK ATAMBAEV TO SOORONBAI JEENBEKOV GAVE WAY TO THE FORMER'S ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT. A SERIES OF OTHER PRIOR ARRESTS AND INCARCERATIONS OF (FORMER) PARLIAMENTARIANS INDICATE THAT KYRGYZSTAN'S PRESIDENTS ARE REGULARLY MANIPULATING THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO PERSECUTE AND NEUTRALIZE THEIR RIVALS. THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT THE REPETITIVE RUPTURING OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WILL USHER IN AN ERA OF HEIGHTENED ILLIBERALISM, ELITE UNCERTAINTY, AND THE FURTHER DISCREDITING OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, THEREBY PLACING THE STATE ON THE BRINK OF FAILURE. THE MASS UPRISING IN RESPONSE TO THE OCTOBER 2020 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTORAL RESULTS AND MOST RECENT COUP D'ETAT INDICATE THAT THE PROSPECTS OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC SUFFERING A COLLAPSE ARE REAL.
850	THE ARTICLE HAS AS OBJECT THE MOST STRIKING TRACES OF CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, USING AS PARAMETERS OF ANALYSIS, ON THE ONE HAND, CONCRETIZING ROLE OF CERTAIN DYNAMICS IN RELATION TO GUIDELINES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OR TRENDS IN MOST CHAPTERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL SYSTEM.
851	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE MULTI-FACETED IMPACT OF HOST COUNTRY RISKS ON THE SUCCESS OF PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THE AUTHORS MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXOGENOUS AND ENDOGENOUS RISKS, DIFFERENTIATING THOSE THAT ARE COMPLETELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE FIRM FROM THOSE IN WHICH FIRMS MIGHT EXERT SOME DEGREE OF INFLUENCE TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH DRAWING ON LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES, THE AUTHORS ANALYZE A SAMPLE OF 10,350 PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN 126 COUNTRIES FROM 1997 TO 2014. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF EXOGENOUS RISK ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER PROBABILITY OF PROJECT SUCCESS, WHEREAS THEY FIND NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FOR ENDOGENOUS RISK. ORIGINALITY/VALUE BY POINTING TO THIS DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT, THIS STUDY MAKES A CONTRIBUTION TO THE CURRENT DEBATE IN THE LITERATURE ON PRIVATE PARTICIPATION PROJECTS.
852	HEALTH CRISES PRODUCE TRANSVERSAL EFFECTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ORDER. DURING THE COVID-19 HEALTH CRISIS, NORMATIVE POWER HAS BEEN AFFECTED IN THE EYES OF CITIZENS. CHALLENGED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, LEGAL NORMS HAVE LOST MUCH OF THEIR NORMATIVE FORCE AND THEIR VALUE IN THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS. IN THE FACE OF THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH NORMATIVE POWER HAS BEEN FRAGMENTED, IT SEEMS URGENT TO ENGAGE WITH REFORM IDEAS THAT LOOK TO RENEW THE FUNCTION OF LEGAL NORMS AND THE PROCESS OF THEIR CREATION. APPLYING THE TOOLS OF LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING AND ADOPTING A MORE PARTNERSHIP-BASED THAN SOVEREIGN CONCEPTION OF THE NORMATIVE FUNCTION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DESIRABLE CHANGES TO NORMATIVE CULTURE.
853	THERE IS NO POINT IN DENYING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN FOR THE STATE OF JUDICIAL DIALOGUE IN EUROPE. IT VINDICATES THE POSITION OF THE BVERFG AS A COURT DESERVING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR ADVANCING THE LAW IN THE CRUCIAL FIELD OF DATA PROTECTION. NEVERTHELESS, RESTRICTING THE SCOPE OF ANALYSIS TO THE NARROW CONTEXT OF JUDICIAL DIALOGUE MISSES THE WIDER CONTEXT OF THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CERTAIN EU MEMBER STATES. IN THIS RESPECT, IT IS OF THE HIGHEST SIGNIFICANCE THAT THE DECISIONS ON THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE IMAGINED NORMATIVE HIERARCHY BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND EU LAW THAT PROVIDED THE BASIS FOR THE BVERFG'S JURISPRUDENCE EVER SINCE SOLANGE I AND MAASTRICHT. MOREOVER, BY REASSERTING THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW, THE BVERFG STRENGTHENS THE POSITION OF EMBATTLED JUDGES IN POLAND FACING DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW. THE CONCERN SHOWN BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE FIRST SENATE FOR THE SITUATION IN POLAND CORROBORATES THIS READING.
854	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONCEPT OF LAW HART SUGGESTS A MISTAKEN ASSIMILATION BETWEEN CONDUCT THAT IS "NON-OPTIONAL" AND CONDUCT THAT IS "OBLIGATORY" (I.E. CONDUCT THAT IS EITHER COERCED OR SUBJECT TO AN OBLIGATION). THIS SUGGESTED ASSIMILATION VITIATES THE ARGUMENT OF THE WHOLE BOOK, LEADING HART TO NEGLECT THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE LAW TYPICALLY TRACKS, CORROBORATES OR CONSTITUTES POWER RELATIONS. IT IS TRUE THAT, FAMOUSLY, ATTENTION IS PAID, IN THE CONCEPT OF LAW, TO NORMATIVE, LEGAL POWERS. BRUTE SOCIAL POWER, AND LAW'S RELATION TO IT, HOWEVER, ARE LARGELY OVERLOOKED. THIS, IN A WAY, HART'S BLIND SPOT.
855	COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD DOCUMENT THEIR STATUTORY LAW IN OFFICIAL LEGAL DATABASES (OLD), BUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PROVIDE EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO (STATUTORY) LAW REMAINS UNEXAMINED. IDEALLY, AN OLD SHOULD BE (I) PROVIDED ONLINE AND FREE FOR ALL WITHOUT REQUIRING REGISTRATION OR PAYMENT, (II) SEARCHABLE WITH REGARD TO STATUTES' TITLES, (III) SEARCHABLE WITH REGARD TO THE FULL TEXTS OF STATUTES, (IV) PROVIDED IN A REUSABLE TEXT-BASED FORMAT AND (V) COMPREHENSIVE IN ITS COVERAGE OF AT LEAST THE LAWS CURRENTLY IN FORCE. TO HIGHLIGHT THE NATURE OF OLDS AS CONSUMER PRODUCTS, WE BORROW A TERM FROM BUSINESS OPERATIONS RESEARCH AND REFER TO A DATABASE FULFILLING THESE BASIC CRITERIA AS A 'MINIMUM VIABLE' OLD. WE SURVEY 204 STATES AND JURISDICTIONS TO ASSESS HOW FAR THEIR COUNTRY-LEVEL OLDS ADHERE TO THE MINIMUM VIABILITY STANDARD. WE FIND THAT ONLY 48% OF THEM DO; 12% OF STATES DO NOT SEEM TO OFFER ANY ONLINE OLD AT ALL; AND A FURTHER 40% OF COUNTRIES OFFER LEGAL DATABASES THAT LACK AT LEAST ONE OF THE CRITERIA LISTED ABOVE. THE QUALITY OF LEGAL ACCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION (WITH EUROPE FARING THE BEST), ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND A POPULATION'S OVERALL INTERNET USAGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COMPARATIVE LEGAL RESEARCH FACES CONSIDERABLE HURDLES WHEN DEALING WITH THE GLOBAL SOUTH; THAT METADATA-ENRICHED DIGITALISATION OF LEGAL CORPORA STILL REMAINS A DESIDERATUM FOR AT LEAST HALF THE WORLD; AND THAT THE INACCESSIBILITY OF LAW MAY CARRY HIGH COSTS FOR LEGAL PRACTITIONERS AND THE WIDER PUBLIC.
856	WE EXAMINE HOW VARIATION IN ANTISEMITISM ACROSS COUNTRIES CAN BE EXPLAINED BY ECONOMIC FREEDOM. WE PROPOSE TWO MECHANISMS. FIRST, THE MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM, THE GREATER THE SCOPE OF MARKET ACTIVITIES. IF PEOPLE PERCEIVE JEWS AS PARTICULARLY SKILFUL AT DOING BUSINESS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS, A GREATER RELIANCE ON MARKETS CAN INCREASE ANTISEMITISM. SECOND, A KEY TYPE OF INSTITUTION UNDERGIRDING THE MARKET IS AN EFFECTIVE AND FAIR LEGAL SYSTEM, OR THE RULE OF LAW. THE STRONGER THE RULE OF LAW, THE SMALLER THE RISK FOR EXPLOITATIVE BEHAVIOUR, AND THE LESS HOSTILE PEOPLE WILL BE TOWARDS GROUPS SEEN AS EXPLOITERS. IF JEWS ARE SEEN AS SUCH, MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM REDUCES ANTISEMITISM. WE USE THE ADL GLOBAL 100 SURVEY OF ANTISEMITIC ATTITUDES AND RELATE THEM, FOR UP TO 106 COUNTRIES, TO THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM OF THE WORLD INDEX AND ITS FIVE AREAS. OUR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS CONFIRM THE TWO PREDICTIONS: THE MORE ECONOMIC OPENNESS, THE MORE ANTISEMITISM; AND THE STRONGER THE RULE OF LAW, THE LESS ANTISEMITISM. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MARKETS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS JEWS.
857	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPARING THE POLICY-MAKING RIGHTS OF THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CZECH REPUBLIC, HUNGARY, LITHUANIA, POLAND AND UKRAINE). THE RIGHT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION TO OPPOSE THE GOVERNMENT FORMED BY THE RULING MAJORITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THE APPLICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES (DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW) IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES DEMONSTRATES THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF FRAGMENTATION, POLARIZATION AND CARTELIZATION OF THE OPPOSITION. THE RULE OF LAW INDEX 2021 EXPLICITLY SHOWS THAT, AMONG THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SURVEYED, LITHUANIA RANKS 18TH, THE CZECH REPUBLIC 22ND, POLAND 36TH, HUNGARY 69TH AND UKRAINE 74TH. THE RULE OF LAW INDEX REFERS TO LIMITATIONS OF GOVERNMENT POWERS, ABSENCE OF CORRUPTION, OPEN GOVERNMENT AND OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THE MISSION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, THE DISTANCE (NOT ONLY IDEOLOGICAL) BETWEEN THE RULING MAJORITY AND THE PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE ABILITY TO FORM GOVERNMENT, PARTICIPATION IN POLICY MAKING, SCRUTINY OF STRATEGY AND (POPULIST) GOVERNMENT POLICY.
858	THE "RETURN OF THE STATE" AS AN ECONOMIC ACTOR HAS LEFT SCHOLARS AT A LACK OF THEORETICAL TOOLS TO CAPTURE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STATE-DOMINATED BUSINESS SYSTEMS. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT ANY TYPE OF STATE INTERVENTION IN THE ECONOMY IS TOO EASILY QUALIFIED AS A SIGN OF "AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM," WHICH HAS LED SCHOLARS TO LUMP TOGETHER COUNTRIES AS DIVERSE AS CHINA, SINGAPORE, AND NORWAY UNDER THAT HEADING. RATHER THAN CONSIDERING ANY TYPE OF STATE INTERVENTION IN THE ECONOMY AS AUTHORITARIAN, WE PROPOSE A MORE SOPHISTICATED CONCEPTUALIZATION, WHICH DISTINGUISHES TWO BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE DOMAINS AND CONCEIVES OF THE "RETURN OF THE STATE" AS THE EROSION OF ONE OR BOTH OF THEM. THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION ALLOWS US TO CLEARLY DISTINGUISH A SHIFT FROM AN IDEAL-TYPICAL MARKET-BASED "REGULATORY CAPITALISM" TO "STATE CAPITALISM" OR "AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM," RESPECTIVELY. WE USE INTERVIEW DATA WITH BUSINESS LEADERS IN AN EXTREME CASE OF THE RETURN OF THE STATE TO IDENTIFY THE NATURE OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH AN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT ERODES THESE PRIVATE-PUBLIC DIVIDES. WE ARGUE THAT A FOCUS ON THESE CONSTITUTIVE MECHANISMS OF THE EROSION OF PRIVATE-PUBLIC DIVIDES ALLOWS US TO DEFINE "AUTHORITARIAN CAPITALISM" IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT A USEFUL TOOL TO UNDERSTAND CONTEXTS BEYOND THE CHINESE CASE IN WHICH IT FIRST EMERGED.
859	THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH FIRMS' RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (R&D) LEVELS ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS IN CHINA BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 680 EUROPEAN UNION (EU) FIRMS OVER THE PERIOD OF 1998-2008. EMPLOYING PANEL DATA ESTIMATION APPROACHES AND FURTHER AUGMENTED WITH THE CROSS-VALIDATION TECHNIQUE, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT EU FDI IN CHINA IS INFLUENCED BY THE HOST COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS, RENDERING SUPPORT TO THE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY. OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AND R&D HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON FDI INFLOWS IN CHINA. FURTHER ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE COEFFICIENT FOR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND R&D IS POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT AFTER WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION (WTO) ENTRY IMPLYING THAT THE EFFECTS OF REFORMS FOLLOWING THE WTO ENTRY MUCH OUTWEIGH THE IMPACT OF RULE OF LAW IN EU FIRMS' DECISIONS TO INVEST IN CHINA. WE ALSO FIND EVIDENCE THAT EU FIRMS TEND TO ADJUST THEIR FDI LEVELS IN CHINA IN AN ATTEMPT TO REACH THE DESIRED INVESTMENT LEVEL.
860	THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES IN DETAIL THE STATE EVOLUTION MECHANISM. THE AUTHORS SHOW THAT MANY DIFFERENT THEORIES AND DOCTRINES, VARIOUS SCHEMES FOR TYPOLOGIZING THE EVOLUTIONARY FORMS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LONG HISTORY OF THE EXISTENCE OF LEGAL, PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES. THE WORK CONTENT INCLUDES THE DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF DEVELOPING RIGOROUS THEORIES OF THE EVOLUTION OF STATE FORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLEXITY AND AMBIGUITY OF PARTICULAR HISTORICAL PROCESSES OF STATE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT. THE AUTHORS DISTINGUISH AND CONSIDER THE EVOLUTIONARY FEATURES OF THE MODERN STATE, JUSTIFY THAT THE MODERN STATE AS A HISTORICAL TYPE POSSESSES A NUMBER OF FEATURES THAT ARE NOT INHERENT ( OR INHERENT ONLY IN PART) IN BOTH THE TRADITIONAL AND THE PROTO-MODERN STATE, WHICH FORM ITS EVOLUTIONARY FEATURES, SPECIFICITY OF FUNCTIONING AND EVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATION. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND ANALYZES FOUR MAIN INNOVATIVE STAGES IN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF MODERN POLITICAL DOMINATION: CIVIL STATE, RULE-OF-LAW STATE, DEMOCRATIC RULE-OF-LAW STATE AND SOCIAL RULE-OF-LAW STATE.
861	AMID THE RAPID EXPANSION OF OIL PALM PLANTATIONS, THE INDONESIAN MINISTRY OF FORESTRY FINDS ITS AUTHORITY OVER THE FORESTED AREAS (KAWASAN HUTAN) UNDER PRESSURE AND CONTINUES TO PURSUE STRATEGIES TO LEGALLY MAINTAIN THE AREAS WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION. COMBINING INSIGHTS FROM LEGAL STUDIES WITH POLITICAL ECONOMY, THIS ARTICLE APPLIES THE CONCEPT OF POLITICAL FORESTS TO CONTEMPORARY CONTESTATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO INDONESIA'S FORESTED AREAS. ESTABLISHING LEGAL CERTAINTY AND RULE OF LAW ARE WIDELY ASSERTED TO BE IMPORTANT BUT NEVER FULLY ACHIEVED. TWO CASES DEMONSTRATE THIS: THE FIRST FOCUSES ON THE NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION OF OVERLAPPING PERMITS IN THE KAWASAN HUTAN BETWEEN THE CENTER AND THE REGION IN CENTRAL KALIMANTAN PROVINCE. THE SECOND EXAMINES THE MANEUVERS OF THE MINISTRY OF FORESTRY TO (RE)ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY OVER KAWASAN HUTAN BY CLASSIFYING PALM OIL AS A TREE CROP. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE WIDESPREAD QUEST FOR CERTAINTY AND RULE OF LAW IS QUIXOTIC BECAUSE IT IGNORES THE REALITIES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, INCLUDING SOCIAL CONFLICT, BENEATH THE VENEER OF LAW.
862	THE PRESUMED LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SUGGESTS THAT AN OPERATIONAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS KEY TO DEVELOPMENT. THE RESEARCH SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY HOW THE DECISION TO DETAIN AN ACCUSED PERSON AFFECTS HIS OR HER SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION. DATA WAS COLLECTED IN KENYA, MOZAMBIQUE AND ZAMBIA. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF THE COERCIVE POWER OF THE STATE EXERCISED THROUGH THE DEPRIVATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIBERTY HAS SERIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. WHILE DETENTION PENDING TRIAL IS JUSTIFIABLE SOMETIMES, WE ARGUE THAT IT IS OVER-USED, FREQUENTLY RESULTING IN EXCESSIVELY LONG DETENTION. THE DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO BE AGENTS OF THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT, INFRINGING ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR DEPENDENTS. STATES CAN JUSTIFY SUCH INFRINGEMENTS ONLY IF THEIR COERCIVE POWER IS USED WITHIN THE AMBIT OF DEMOCRATIC AND RIGHTS-RESPECTING LAWS COMPLYING WITH HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS.
863	OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS RAPIDLY CARVED OUT FOR ITSELF A CRITICAL ROLE IN DEFENDING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS AGAINST THE ONGOING PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL BACKSLIDING UNFOLDING IN POLAND. AWARE OF THE RAPID DEMOCRATIC DECLINE FACING THE COUNTRY, THE COURT HAS RECENTLY DECIDED TO COMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGY VIS-A-VIS THE POLISH CRISIS BY MAKING USE OF INTERIM MEASURES. SINCE EARLY 2022, IN FACT, THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY RESORTED TO ITS POWERS UNDER RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE PROTECTION TO POLISH JUDGES FACING DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS DUE EITHER TO THEIR OFF-BENCH MOBILISATION AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORMS OR TO THE JUDICIAL APPLICATION OF EUROPEAN STANDARDS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS ENSHRINED IN ART. 6(1) ECHR, AS WELL AS IN ART. 19 TEU AND ART. 47 OF THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS FAR FROM OBVIOUS IN LIGHT OF THE COURT'S PRACTICE UNDER RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT AND OFFERS A FIRST APPRAISAL OF THE REASONS UNDERLYING THE COURT'S MORE ACTIVE STANCE TO THE USE OF INTERIM MEASURES IN THE POLISH CRISIS.
864	A COMMON PHENOMENON IN TAX ADMINISTRATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS THAT TAX IS COLLECTED, NOT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF LAW, BUT ACCORDING TO INFORMAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AND TAX COLLECTORS. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NOVEL EXPLANATION OF THIS PHENOMENON IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECENTRALIZATION. ADMINISTRATIVE DECENTRALIZATION IS DEFINED AS THE CONCENTRATION OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS AT THE LOWEST RANKS OF A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED BUREAUCRACY. DECENTRALIZATION INCREASES THE COMMUNICATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW AND CHANGES THE STRUCTURE OF TAXPAYERS' COSTS IN OBTAINING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE LAW. AS A RESULT, THERE EMERGES A 'SEMI-COMPLIANT' TYPE OF BEHAVIOUR, INVOLVING MANY TAXPAYERS WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLIANT UNDER A RULE-BASED SYSTEM, WHERE TAX IS REMITTED AND COLLECTED DESPITE BOTH SIDES' BEING UNDER-INFORMED ABOUT THE LAW. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS DYNAMIC HAS FRUSTRATED TAX ADMINISTRATION REFORM IN CHINA AND, INTERESTINGLY, EXPLAINS THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF THE TAX PROFESSIONS AND OF TAX LITIGATION.
865	SUBJECT AND SCOPE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ESTABLISH THE EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF JUDICIAL POLICE FUNCTIONS. CHARACTERISTICS: THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS AN ANALYSIS OF FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THE COLOMBIAN CASE (I) DUE TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFLICT IN COLOMBIA BY THE CONCENTRATION OF JUDICIAL POLICE FUNCTIONS IN THE CUERPO TECNICO DE INVESTIGACION (CTI) OF THE FISCALIA GENERAL DE LA NACI6N, THE HIGH NUMBER OF OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES LINKED TO THIS ESSENTIAL BODY IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE JUDICIAL BODY IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING PUNISHABLE ACTS; AND (II) DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCURSION OF PERSONNEL LINKED TO CONDUCT, CONTRARY TO THE LEGAL ORDER, IN THE EXERCISING OF THEIR ASSIGNED FUNCTIONS. FINDINGS: OBLIGATIONS FORM THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY IN THE CIVIL FIELD; AND LEGAL ACTS AND FACTS ARE THE SOURCE OF OBLIGATIONS. FROM THE ILLEGAL ACT, LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FINDS ITS LEGAL BASIS IN THAT IT FORCES THE PERSON WHO HAS CAUSED A LOSS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE COMMITTED. CONCLUSIONS: THE TRANSITION FROM THE ABSOLUTE STATE TO THE STATE OF LAW AND LATER TO THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW BROUGHT, AMONG OTHER CONSEQUENCES, THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE UNACCOUNTABLE STATE TO THE STATE THAT IS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGES CAUSED BY ITS AGENTS.
866	THE IDEALS OF JUDICIAL DUTY AND THE LAW CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY REALISED IN AFRICA WHERE THERE IS A THEORY OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH SOUGHT TO SUGGEST THAT SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS ARE LESS IMPORTANT FOR THE SUBJECTS OF LAW ON THE CONTINENT. RIGHTS, WHETHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC OR CIVIL AND POLITICAL IN NATURE, MUST BE SEEN AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THAT LIGHT, ANY CONCEPTION OF RIGHTS BY ANY COURT THAT DISCOUNTS SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS CONSTITUENCY IS A NEGATION OF THE IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF LAW ON THE CONTINENT. DEMOCRACIES IN AFRICA AND CONSISTENT WITH THEIR TRUE PLURAL CUSTOMARY VALUES CANNOT SUSTAIN A THEORY OF LAW AND RIGHTS THAT BIFURCATE THE STRUCTURE OF RIGHTS. RIGHTS ARE RIGHTS AND MUST BE CONCEIVED AND ENFORCED WITHOUT ANY NOMINATIVE CLASSIFICATION THAT DISCOUNTS THEIR UNITY; IT IS THE BEST WAY THAT RULE OF LAW CAN HAVE A BETTER MEANING FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE CONTINENT AS SUBJECTS OF THE LAW SO ENACTED.
867	IN OCTOBER 2014, THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A "SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS." SINCE THEN A GROUP OF CHINESE POLITICAL ELITES THAT WE REFER TO AS NEW LEGALISTS HAS BEEN CALLING FOR ETHNIC CONFLICT TO BE MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE DEEPLY EMBEDDED AND HIGHLY POLITICIZED PROBLEM OF ETHNIC CONFLICT IN CHINA LENDS CREDENCE TO THE LEGALIST POSITION THAT NEW LAW-BASED APPROACHES ARE NEEDED, ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL PROBLEMS ARISE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW. THERE ARE FOR INSTANCE POWERFUL FACTIONS IN THE COUNTRY SUPPORTING THE CONTINUATION OF REPRESSIVE POLICIES OR SELECTIVE ETHNIC PREFERENTIALISM, AND THERE ARE RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF LEGAL AWARENESS IN ETHNIC-MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND GENERAL INADEQUACIES IN THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM. WE ARGUE THAT AN ELITE GROUP OF NEW LEGALISTS IN CHINA IS ATTEMPTING TO RESHAPE ETHNIC-MINORITY POLICY IN ORDER TO BREAK FREE FROM THE EVERYDAY PROTEAN POLITICS OF ETHNIC RELATIONS THAT IS BASED LARGELY ON A NEGATIVE CYCLE OF VIOLENT CONFRONTATION AND FINANCIAL COMPENSATION.
868	BUILDING UPON A MANIFESTO IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AGE OF 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE', WE, THE TRANSATLANTIC REFLECTION GROUP ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AGE OF 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE', HAVE RECONVENED TO DRAFT A SECOND CONSENSUS MANIFESTO THAT CALLS FOR THE EFFECTIVE AND LEGITIMATE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS CONCERNING AI SYSTEMS. IN DOING SO, WE RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANT AND COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF STANDARDS AND COMPLIANCE PRACTICES. WHEREAS THE FIRST MANIFESTO FOCUSED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC LAW-MAKING AND TECHNOLOGY, THIS SECOND MANIFESTO SHIFTS FOCUS FROM THE DESIGN OF LAW IN THE AGE OF AI TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW. CONCRETELY, WE OFFER 10 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDRESSING THE KEY ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGES SHARED ACROSS TRANSATLANTIC STAKEHOLDERS. WE CALL ON THOSE WHO SUPPORT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO SIGN THIS MANIFESTO. THE FIFTH EDITION OF THE ATHENS ROUNDTABLE ON AI AND THE RULE OF LAW WILL TAKE PLACE ON NOVEMBER 30TH AND DECEMBER 1ST, 2023. IT WILL DELVE INTO PRESSING GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES POSED BY FOUNDATION MODELS AND GENERATIVE AI ACROSS JURISDICTIONS.
869	LAWYERS' PARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL LIFE MARKS THE MATURITY OF A COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW. LAWYERS ARE WELL EQUIPPED TO BE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AND SHOULD PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION THAT GOES BEYOND THEIR ROLE IN DEALING WITH INDIVIDUAL CASES. THE LEGAL PROFESSION FUNCTIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS: PARTICIPATING IN LEGISLATION AND PROMOTING LEGAL PROGRESS; ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITIES IN GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS; INFLUENCING THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF JUST POLICIES; ACTING AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC; RESPONDING TO THE CLAIMS OF DIFFERENT INTEREST GROUPS; ETC. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE RULE OF LAW, AS EVIDENCED IN THE INFILTRATION OF COMMERCIALISM INTO THE PROFESSION, GIVING ABSOLUTE PRIORITY TO CLIENTS' INTERESTS, AND EXCESSIVE LITIGATION. TO KEEP THESE DOWNSIDES UNDER CONTROL, WE NEED A LEGAL CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL BASIS THAT ARE A GOOD FIT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO UPDATE TRADITIONAL MINDSETS, ADOPT RIGHTS-BASED STANDARDS, UPHOLD THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW, AND PROMOTE THE FORMATION OF A LEGAL COMMUNITY.
870	WHETHER NATIONAL (CONSTITUTIONAL) COURTS ARE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW OF THE DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IS NOT ONLY A CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION, BUT ALSO ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIVE ISSUES IN EUROPEAN AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS FIRSTLY THE GENERAL AND OFTEN EMOTIONAL CRITICISM OF NATIONAL ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW IN GENERAL AND ANSWERS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHETHER NATIONAL ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW REPRESENTS A THREAT OR RATHER AN ASSET TO THE RULE OF LAW AT A NATIONAL, EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. IT ARGUES THAT A NATIONAL ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW IS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT TO SUPERVISE THE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIARY PROVIDED THAT IT IS NOT ABUSIVE OF THE LAW. SECONDLY, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PSPP JUDGMENT AND THE POLISH ULTRA-VIRES DECISION OF OCTOBER 21, 2021. IT CONCLUDES THAT ONLY THE ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW OF THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A RULE OF LAW BASED CONTROL. THE FINAL ARGUMENT IS THAT A RULE OF LAW BASED ULTRA-VIRES REVIEW SHOULD BE SEEN AS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN THE CURRENT PROCESS OF DELIMITING VERTICAL AUTHORITY.
871	ALTHOUGH SOME ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ELUCIDATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE AND HOUSING PRICES, THE EXISTING LITERATURE STILL PROVIDES LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MEDIATING MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE CORRELATES WITH HOUSING PRICES. THIS STUDY SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATES HOW THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND HOUSING PRICES IS SENSITIVE TO PUBLIC SATISFACTION, AND HOW THE CONNECTION IS HETEROGENEOUS ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS. USING PANEL DATA OF CHINESE CITIES OVER THE PERIOD 2014-2017, OUR ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATION RESULTS INDICATE THAT LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE MAY ENLARGE FINANCIAL LOANS AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND THEN RAISE HOUSING PRICES, WHICH IS ROBUST TO DIFFERENT SPECIFICATIONS. MOREOVER, THE RELATIONSHIP IS HETEROGENEOUS ACROSS CITY GROUPS AND SENSITIVE TO THE DEGREE OF SATISFACTION WITH THE RULE OF LAW QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE MEDIATING ROLE OF FINANCIAL LOANS IS LARGER THAN THAT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT. IN THE STAGE OF EMERGING ECONOMIES' PURSUIT OF THE RULE OF LAW, OUR FINDINGS HAVE USEFUL IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTROL RAPIDLY RISING HOUSING PRICES BY REDUCING LOANS AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT.
872	JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AGENCY BEHAVIOR IS OFTEN CRITICIZED AS EITHER INTERFERING TOO MUCH WITH AGENCIES' DOMAINS OR DOING TOO LITTLE TO ENSURE FIDELITY TO STATUTORY DIRECTIVES AND THE RULE OF LAW. BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF AGENCY ACTIONS THAT BLATANTLY FLOUT SETTLED ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW DOCTRINE. THIS PHENOMENON, WHICH WE TERM "REGULATORY SLOP," REQUIRES COURTS TO REINFORCE THE NORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW BY ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED DOCTRINE AND PAYING CAREFUL ATTENTION TO REMEDIAL OPTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DOCUMENT NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF REGULATORY SLOP AND CANVASS HOW THE TRUMP AGENCIES HAVE FARED IN COURT THUS FAR. WE CONTEND THAT TRADITIONAL CRITIQUES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW CARRY LITTLE FORCE IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHER, REGULATORY SLOP SHOULD BE OF CONCERN REGARDLESS OF ONE'S POLITICAL LEANINGS BECAUSE IT THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW. RATHER THAN ARGUE FOR A CHANGE TO SUBSTANTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW DOCTRINE, THEREFORE, WE TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT COURTS' REMEDIAL OPTIONS IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. WE CONCLUDE THAT A STRONG APPROACH TO REMEDIES CAN SEND CORRECTIVE SIGNALS TO AGENCIES THAT REINFORCE BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW VALUES AND THE RULE OF LAW.
873	SINCE THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, ACROSS NORTH ATLANTIC COUNTRIES, COUNTERTERRORISM LAW HAS BEEN AN AREA OF RELENTLESS, HIGHLY PRIORITIZED, LEGAL PRODUCTION THAT OFTEN CHALLENGES RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF UNITED KINGDOM COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION AND, DRAWING FROM JURISPRUDENCE, STATE THEORY, AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, CONSTRUCTS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BROADER SHAPE, FUNCTION, AND LOGIC OF LAW. IT STARTS BY ASSESSING THE DYNAMIC TENSION BETWEEN AUTHORITARIAN AND DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTES MODERN LAW, THUS SETTING THE OVERALL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH COUNTERTERRORISM LAW PERTAINS. IT PROCEEDS TO ANALYZE U.K. COUNTERTERRORISM LAW, BY JUXTAPOSING IT TO ITS UNITED STATES COUNTERPART AND BY DECIPHERING THE KEY TRENDS INTO WHICH ITS PROVISIONS COMBINE. BASED ON THIS ACCOUNT, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF COUNTERTERRORISM LAW FOR THE LAW-FORM, THAT IS, FOR THE ARTICULATION BETWEEN LEGAL CONTENT, LOGIC, AND INSTITUTIONALITY. IT FINDS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE CONTENT AND LOGIC OF COUNTERTERRORISM LAW ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES, THEY ARE DEVELOPED IN AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ADHERENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PARADOX, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT COUNTERTERRORISM LAW SIGNALS THE ADVENT OF AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY, A RECONFIGURATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WHERE THE LATTER HOLDS ITS INSTITUTIONAL SHAPE, BUT COMES TO CONSIST OF, AND BE DRIVEN BY, AUTHORITARIAN CONTENT AND PURPOSES. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY, COMPARES IT TO EXISTING APPROACHES TO COUNTERTERRORISM LAW, AND INDICATES ITS PLAUSIBILITY FOR U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM JURISPRUDENCE.
874	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONCEPTUAL AND HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEVELOPMENT. IT ARGUES THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT REPRESENT THESE TWO IDEAS HAVE HAD LITTLE ENGAGEMENT, AND YET THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THEIR AREAS OF CONCERN. GIVEN THAT THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS 2015 HAVE STRONGLY EMBRACED GOOD GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND WE HAVE BECOME ADEPT AT DEFINING AND ARTICULATING THE RULE OF LAW, THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT TO ENGAGE WITH CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM TO USE "DEVELOPMENTAL OPERATIVITY", AS I CALL IT, TO ADVANCE ITS OBJECTIVES IN PRACTICE.
875	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE, AND STRUCTURAL ANALYSES OF VARIOUS PROCESSES DESCRIBED AS DEMOCRATIZATION OR DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS. THE OPENING SECTIONS ADDRESS THE MEANING AND GENERAL THEORIES OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE EMERGENCE OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION STUDIES. STRUCTURAL ASPECTS, DIFFERENT ACTORS, THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND ROUNDTABLE TALKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECT OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS ARE DISCUSSED, AND CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN DEMOCRATIZATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE ANALYZED IN THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS. FINALLY, PROBLEMS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND DEALING WITH THE AUTHORITARIAN PAST ARE CONSIDERED AS AN INTRINSIC PART OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS.
876	IN THE SUMMER OF 2019, PROTESTERS TOOK TO THE STREETS OF HONG KONG. AFTER THOUSANDS OF ARRESTS FOR PROTEST-RELATED OFFENCES, AMNESTY FOR STREET PROTESTERS WAS PROPOSED BUT NOT ADOPTED, PRIMARILY ON THE GROUND THAT AMNESTY WOULD UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON COMPARATIVE EXPERIENCES AND THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT FOUR VALUE-BASED RATIONALES FOR PROTEST AMNESTY - RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC RESPONSIVENESS, VIRTUE AND POLITICAL TRUST - AND CONSIDERS THE RELEVANCE OF EACH IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF HONG KONG. IN DOING SO, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE DISTINCTIVE AND OVERLOOKED CONTEXT OF STREET PROTEST IN THE LITERATURE ON AMNESTIES.
877	THIS STUDY EXPLORES STATE STABILITY USING VARIOUS GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS. WE FIND STABILITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE CAPACITY AND PUBLIC GOODS, THE LEGAL-RATIONAL STATE, LEGITIMACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION, INCOME/CAPITA AND DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY, LEGITIMACY, RULE OF LAW AND SECULARITY. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND DEBT DEPENDENCY UNDERMINE STABILITY. REVENUE COLLECTION, CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW, INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND EXPORTS CAN BE IMPORTANT TO STABILITY EVEN IN THE FACE OF INCOMPLETE DEMOCRACY AND LOWER GDP PER CAPITA. THESE FACTORS ARE RELATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT IN LOW-INCOME STATES.
878	THIS NOTE ANALYZES NEPAL'S ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AFTERMATH OF ITS TEN-YEAR CIVIL WAR. IT COMPARES NEPAL'S TREATMENT OF PERSONS IMPLICATED IN GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL FRAMEWORK SURROUNDING A STATE'S INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN ITS USE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS. IT ARGUES THAT NEPAL'S FAILURE TO BRING EITHER ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS AGAINST OFFICIALS ACCUSED OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND ITS RELIANCE INSTEAD ON TRUTH COMMISSIONS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND VIOLATES THE COUNTRY'S INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS.
879	THE DEMANDS OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FOR THE FULL RESPECT OF THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY, IN WHICH THE CRIMINAL JURISDICTION IS INCLUDED, IS ONE OF THE DISPUTES CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW IS FACING NOW AS A LEGAL POLITICAL MODEL. THE CHANGE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PARADIGM IS NEEDED TO PROMOTE A FULL RESPECT POLICY OF ALL PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. TO RATIONALLY SOLVE THESE DISPUTES, IS REQUIRED FIRST THAT THE MEXICAN RULE OF LAW'S THEORICAL MODEL AND POLITICAL PROJECT FIT THE GUARANTOR CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL; AND SECONDLY, THE ALIGNMENT OF THE LEGISLATION AND LEGAL OPERATION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS.
880	SENTENCING IS MEANT TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW. NUMEROUS ASSUMPTIONS UNDERPINNING CURRENT SENTENCING PRACTICES ARE BEING QUESTIONED MORE AND MORE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES FOUR ASSUMPTIONS BY QUESTIONING THEIR VALIDITY. EACH OF THE EXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN UNDERPINNING THE PRESENT PUNITIVE PARADIGM OF SENTENCING. CONSEQUENCES OF CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO A PUNITIVE PARADIGM APPROACH TO SENTENCING ARE BEING SHOWN TO INCLUDE FOSTERING RECIDIVISM AND CONTRIBUTING TO A SPREAD OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT BEYOND THE EXISTING PRISON POPULATION. THE THESIS ADVANCED IS THAT A PUNITIVE PARADIGM IN SENTENCING DILUTES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SENTENCING AS AN AID TO THE RULE OF LAW.
881	WHILE STUDIES OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN INSTITUTIONS HAVE LONG BEEN A PART OF THE PUBLIC OPINION LITERATURE, SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA'S LOWER COURTS HAS BEEN MISSING. THIS IS TROUBLING, ESPECIALLY SINCE SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS INTEGRAL TO A DEMOCRACY AND SUPPORT FOR COURTS ESSENTIAL TO THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. I OFFER AN EXPLANATION OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR LOWER COURTS, FINDING THAT EXPERIENCE WITH COURTS, PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FAIRNESS OF COURT PROCEDURES, AND CHOICES MADE OVER INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN ALL PLAY A ROLE IN EXPLAINING THE PUBLIC'S SUPPORT FOR STATE COURTS.
882	CROATIA'S ACCESSION TO NATO, AND SOON THE EUROPEAN UNION, PRESUPPOSES THAT ITS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM HAS ALREADY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF IN-DEPTH REFORMS BASED ON SOUND DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES AND THE RULE OF LAW. HAS THIS, IN FACT, BEEN THE CASE? THIS ARTICLE ANSWERS THIS QUESTION AND IN DOING SO BREAKS DOWN THE INTELLIGENCE REFORMS UNDERTAKEN INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES. IT CONCLUDES THAT CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE, ORGANIZATION, OVERSIGHT, AND ACCOUNTABILITY, ALONG WITH PRESSURES TO JOIN EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS, HAVE HELPED CROATIA DEVELOP AN INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM INCREASINGLY RESPECTFUL OF DEMOCRATIC NORMS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
883	MUCH OF THE CURRENT DONOR DISCUSSION OF GOVERNANCE TAKES PLACE OUTSIDE OF A HISTORICAL OR THEORETICAL CONTEXT. THIS ARTICLE LOCATES THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE WITHIN RECENT POLITICAL SCIENCE, DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS LITERATURE. THE REVIEW FOCUSES ON ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, TRANSPARENCY, AND PREDICTABILITY OR THE RULE OF LAW, AND INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THESE VARIABLES UPON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. IT CONCLUDES THAT DONORS CAN BEST ASSIST GOOD GOVERNANCE TO DEVELOP BY HELPING TO FOSTER CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH DEVELOPING SOCIETIES CAN PUSH THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER THE ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND RULE OF LAW THAT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES.
884	THE FIELD OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN A RECOGNIZABLE ONE FOR APPROXIMATELY A HALF-CENTURY. HOWEVER, EVALUATIONS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT ENDEAVOR APPEAR OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVE. FAILURE OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DUE TO A LACK OF EITHER TALENT OR MONEY. SOME OF THE WORLD'S BEST LEGAL TALENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE PROBLEMS, AND VERY LARGE SUMS OF MONEY HAVE BEEN SPENT. THE FAILURE APPEARS RATHER TO HAVE BEEN CONCEPTUAL, AS SUGGESTED BY THE NEED FOR AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY. SO SOME CRITICAL CONSIDERATION APPEARS NECESSARY OF THE MAIN UNDERLYING CONCEPTS WHICH HAVE DRIVEN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. SUBSEQUENT ATTENTION WILL BE GIVEN TO AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY, THAT OF SUSTAINABLE DIVERSITY IN LAW. THE RULE OF LAW HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A USEFUL CONCEPT IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD; IT COULD WELL BE REPLACED BY THE RULE OF LAWS.
885	WITH THE RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW IS COMMITTED TO GUIDE THE PRACTICE THAT LEGITIMIZES ITS EXISTENCE TOWARDS THE PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF EVERY HUMAN BEING. THE PRO PERSON PRINCIPLE IS A PROMINENT PIECE IN THIS NEW HISTORICAL STAGE OF THE RULE OF LAW, SINCE ITS APPLICATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD LEGAL PRACTICE TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE VALUES. CONSIDERING THE ABOVE, THE CENTRAL ISSUE THAT THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND POINTS TO THE MEANING AND SCOPE OF THE PRO PERSONA PRINCIPLE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHERE IS THE RADICAL AND OBJECTIVE JUSTIFICATION OF ITS VALIDITY?
886	IN RECENT YEARS THE CREEPING DETERIORATION OF DEMOCRATIC RULE WORLDWIDE HAS BECOME A MAJOR PREOCCUPATION ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF RESEARCH FIELDS AND DISCIPLINESESPECIALLY PUBLIC LAW AND POLITICAL SCIENCEAS SCHOLARS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF EVOLVING THREATS TO A BROAD RANGE OF DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. MANY TERMS ARE NOW USED TO REFER TO THE INCREMENTAL DEGRADATION OF DEMOCRATIC RULE WORLDWIDE, OR DEMOCRATIC DECAY'. ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM. AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM. POPULIST CONSTITUTIONALISM. BAD FAITH CONSTITUTIONALISM. DE-CONSTITUTIONALISM. CONSTITUTIONAL RETROGRESSION. CONSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE. CONSTITUTIONAL ROT. CONSTITUTIONAL DECAY. DEMOCRATIC DECONSOLIDATION. DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING. AUTHORITARIANISATION. AUTHORITARIAN BACKSLIDING. RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING. DEMOCRATIC EROSION. DEMOCRATIC RECESSION. THE LIST GOES ON. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONCEIVING OF THIS SCATTERED CROSS-DISCIPLINARY LITERATURE AS A RESEARCH FIELD AND PROVIDING AN ACCOUNT OF RECENT CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT CAN HELP TO MAP A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING LANDSCAPE, MAXIMISE THE ANALYTICAL UTILITY OF KEY CONCEPTS, IDENTIFY RESONANCES AND DUPLICATION AMONG CONCEPTS AND ACROSS DISCRETE LITERATURES, AND CAN HELP TO ENSURE THAT THIS EMERGING QUASI-FIELD DEVELOPS IN A MORE COHERENT AND RIGOROUS MANNER.
887	THIS PAPER SUMMARIZES THE METHODOLOGY OF THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) PROJECT, AND RELATED ANALYTICAL ISSUES. THE WGI HAS COVERED OVER TWO HUNDRED COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, MEASURING SIX DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE STARTING IN 1996: VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE AGGREGATE INDICATORS ARE BASED ON SEVERAL HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL UNDERLYING VARIABLES, TAKEN FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF EXISTING DATA SOURCES. THE DATA REFLECT THE VIEWS ON GOVERNANCE OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS AND PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND NGO SECTOR EXPERTS WORLDWIDE. WE ALSO EXPLICITLY REPORT MARGINS OF ERROR ACCOMPANYING EACH COUNTRY ESTIMATE. THESE REFLECT THE INHERENT DIFFICULTIES IN MEASURING GOVERNANCE USING ANY KIND OF DATA. WE FIND THAT EVEN AFTER TAKING MARGINS OF ERROR INTO ACCOUNT, THE WGI PERMIT MEANINGFUL CROSS-COUNTRY AND OVER-TIME COMPARISONS. THE AGGREGATE INDICATORS, TOGETHER WITH THE DISAGGREGATED UNDERLYING SOURCE DATA, ARE AVAILABLE AT <WWW.GOVINDICATORS.ORG>.
888	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES RICHARD POSNER'S CRITIQUE OF EA. HAYEK'S LEGAL THEORY AND CONTRASTS THE TWO THINKERS' VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE NATURE OF LAW, KNOWLEDGE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. POSNER CONCEIVES OF LAW AS A SERIES OF DISPARATE RULES AND AS PURPOSIVE. HE BELIEVES THAT A JUDGE SHOULD EXAMINE AN INDIVIDUAL RULE AND COME TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THE RULE IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AVAILABLE. HAYEK, ON THE OTHER HAND, CONCEIVES OF LAW AS A PURPOSE-INDEPENDENT SET OF LEGAL RULES BOUND WITHIN A LARGER SOCIAL ORDER. FURTHER, POSNER, AS A LEGAL POSITIVIST, VIEWS LAW AS AN ORDER CONSCIOUSLY MADE THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF JUDGES AND LEGISLATORS. HAYEK, HOWEVER, VIEWS LAW AS A SPONTANEOUS ORDER THAT ARISES OUT OF HUMAN ACTION BUT NOT FROM HUMAN DESIGN. FOR HAYEK, LAW AS A SPONTANEOUS ORDER-OF WHICH THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE COMMON LAW-CONTAINS AND TRANSMITS KNOWLEDGE THAT NO ONE PERSON OR COMMITTEE COULD EVER KNOW AND, THUS, REGULATES SOCIETY BETTER THAN A PERSON OR COMMITTEE COULD. THIS LIMITS THE SUCCESS OF JUDGES IN CONSCIOUSLY CREATING LEGAL RULES BECAUSE A JUDGE IS LIMITED IN THE FORETHOUGHT NECESSARY TO CONNECT A RULE TO OTHER LEGAL AND NON-LEGAL RULES AND IN WHAT HAYEK TERMED "THE KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF TIME AND PLACE. " THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES POSNERS ARGUMENT THAT HAYEK. MISUNDERSTOOD THE "RULE OF LAW" AS THE "RULE OF GOOD LAW. " CONTRARY TO POSNER, IN THE VIEW HAYEK CAME TO ESPOUSE IN HIS LATER WORK, THE COMMON LAW EMBODIES THE RULE OF LAW IN A WAY THAT POSITIVIST CREATIONS OF LAW DO NOT. WHEN JUDGES CONSCIOUSLY MAKE LAW, IT IS THOSE HUMAN ACTORS, NOT THE "LAW" AS SUCH, THAT "RULE. " MIEN LAW ARISES OUT OF A SPONTANEOUS ORDER, HOWEVER, IT IS THE LAW THAT RULES. JUDGES MERELY ARTICULATE IT. POSNER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE TWO PROCESSES AND, THEREFORE, SEES A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF "GOOD" LAW THAT HAYEK DOES NOT. THIS IS BECAUSE FOR HAYEK, THE RULE OF LAW IS MEANINGFUL ONLY IN A LIBERAL SOCIETY WHERE LAW ARISES OUT OF A SPONTANEOUS ORDER.
889	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE VALUES ASCRIBED TO THE LIVES OF NON-CITIZENS BY THE IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT'S SECURITY CERTIFICATE PROCESS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR STATE POWER AND POLITICAL FREEDOM. UNDER THE IMPERATIVE OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE "WAR ON TERROR," THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE FUNCTIONS AS A MOMENT OF LEGAL EXCEPTION FOR THE ASSERTION OF SOVEREIGN POWER AND LEGITIMATION. THIS COMPROMISES THE RULE OF LAW AND DENIES BASIC LEGAL PROTECTION TO NON-CITIZEN DETAINEES. THE FIRST SECTION OF THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES OF THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE USE OF DETENTION AND EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE DEROGATES THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND SECTION CONSIDERS HOW ERODING THE RULE OF LAW OPENS A SPACE OF EXCEPTION FOR THE EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGN, UNMITIGATED STATE POWER THAT IS GROUNDED IN THE DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA OF CITIZENSHIP STATUS SO AS TO IMPLICATE FOREIGNNESS IN THE PRODUCTION OF DANGER. THE FINAL SECTION ADDRESSES HOW THE SECURITY CERTIFICATE CONFIGURES FREEDOM AS COMMENSURATE WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY OBJECTIVES OF THE "'WAR ON TERROR", EXPOSING THE LIMITATIONS OF LIBERAL FREEDOM IN RELATION TO MODERN STATE POWER.
890	I ARGUE THAT HANS KELSEN ANTICIPATED THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF JEREMY'S WALDRON'S ARTICLE: THE IDEA THAT THE PLACE OF NATION STATES IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IS AKIN TO THAT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES IN THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER, AND THUS AS WIELDING DELEGATED RATHER THAN ORIGINAL AUTHORITY. FOR BOTH WISH TO UNDERSTAND SOVEREIGNTY AS A KIND OF METAPHOR FOR THE UNITY OF A LEGAL SYSTEM RATHER THAN AS A PRE-LEGAL ENTITY. HOWEVER, LEGAL POSITIVISM IS UNABLE TO MAKE THE MOVE TO CONCEIVING OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT WAY, SINCE THE POSITIVIST PREJUDICE AGAINST NATURAL LAW HAS THE RESULT THAT THE IDEA OF A PRE-LEGAL SOVEREIGN IS REPRESSED IN ONE PLACE ONLY TO POP UP IN MULTIPLE OTHERS. IN ISSUE IN THIS DEBATE ARE TWO CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, A POSITIVISTIC CONCEPTION THAT THE RULE OF LAW CONSISTS MAINLY OF DETERMINATE RULES AND A FULLERIAN CONCEPTION IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDERSTOOD AS FACILITATING A CERTAIN PROCESS OF REASON AND ARGUMENT. SINCE WALDRON SEES THE ATTRACTION OF THE LATTER CONCEPTION, AND SINCE THAT CONCEPTION AVOIDS THE PROBLEM OF THE PESKY SOVEREIGN, I SUGGEST THAT WALDRON SHOULD EMBRACE IT.
891	THE CHAPTER BEGINS WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE DRAFT DEFINITION OF TERRORISM IN THE UN AD HOC COMMITTEE ON TERRORISM, A DEFINITION WHICH COVERS BOTH TERRORIST BLACKMAIL AND INTIMIDATION OF TARGET AUDIENCES BUT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE TERRORIST GOAL OF IMPRESSING POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL CONSTITUENCIES WITH THEIR "PROPAGANDA BY THE DEED". IT DISTINGUISHES THEN BETWEEN A MILITARY RESPONSE TO TERRORISM, BASED ON MAXIMUM FORCE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LAWS OF WAR, AND A LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE, BASED ON MINIMAL USE OF FORCE, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW. SUBSEQUENTLY TWELVE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE OUTLINED AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO HUMAN RIGHTS IS CLARIFIED. NEXT A DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO TERRORISM AND COUNTERING TERRORISM FOLLOWS. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TERRORISM PREVENTION BRANCH OF THE UN OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME ARE DISCUSSED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE THREE-PRONGED UN STRATEGY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THE CHAPTER ENDS BY STRESSED THAT UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS AND EFFECTIVE ANTI-TERRORIST MEASURES ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE. ON THE CONTRARY: HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE ESSENTIAL TOOLS IN THE EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM.
892	THE RULE OF LAW HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHERISHED AS ONE OF THE KEY INSTITUTIONS CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFORMATION OF HONG KONG FROM 'A BARREN ROCK' INTO A GLOBAL CITY. THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION'S RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN TESTED BY SPORADIC POLITICAL TURBULENCE DURING THE 150 YEARS OF BRITISH RULE. DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND OTHER KEY PRINCIPLES OF ENGLISH LAWS HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED BY POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY WHEN THE COLONIZERS FELT THREATENED BY CHALLENGES FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. THE 1967 RIOTS WAS ONE OF THOSE DIFFICULT TIMES. DESPITE THE FACADE OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR FIRMNESS AGAINST DISTURBANCES ENJOYED BY THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT, THE EXERCISE OF SOME OF THESE EMERGENCY POWERS, PARTICULARLY THE POWERS TO DETAIN AND DEPORT, REMAINED HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. WITH NORMALIZATION OF THE ANGLO-CHINESE RELATIONSHIP IN MIND, THE CONFRONTATION PRISONERS CONSTITUTED A STUMBLING BLOCK FOR RENEWING THE FRIENDSHIP WITH BEIJING. THE VARIOUS ATTEMPTS MADE BY LONDON AT PRESSURIZING THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT FOR EARLY RELEASE OF THESE PRISONERS ATTEST TO THE PREVALENCE OF POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY OVER THE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW UNDER COLONIAL RULE.
893	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GOVERNANCE QUALITY AT COUNTRY LEVEL AND STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY INVESTIGATES THE INFLUENCE OF CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON ALL-SHARE INDEX OF THE STOCK MARKETS OF THE SIX GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC) COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY IS ANCHORED ON TWO THEORIES - THE EFFICIENT MARKET HYPOTHESIS (EMH) AND INSTITUTIONAL THEORY. THE STUDY EMPLOYS PANEL DATA SPANNING FROM 2006 TO 2017. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE AND RULE OF LAW EXHIBIT A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE, WHILE REGULATORY QUALITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT, BUT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY DEVOID OF VIOLENCE HAVE STRONG IMPACT ON STOCK MARKET RETURNS. SIMILARLY, IMPROVED STOCK MARKET RETURNS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF MARKET AS INVESTORS ARE ALWAYS WARY OF THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE MARKET. THIS STUDY HAS CRUCIAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE GCC COUNTRIES AND STOCK MARKET PARTICIPANTS.
894	WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY ABOUT THE 2014 FIFA WORLD CUP THAT MEASURED ATTITUDES ABOUT FIFA, PLAYERS, AND OFFICIALS IN 18 LANGUAGES WITH 4600 RESPONDENTS FROM 29 COUNTRIES. SIXTY PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS PERCEIVED FIFA OFFICIALS AS BEING DISHONEST, AND PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES WITH LESS INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION AND STRONGER RULE OF LAW PERCEIVED FIFA OFFICIALS AS BEING MORE CORRUPT AND LESS COMPETENT RUNNING THE TOURNAMENT THAN PEOPLE FROM COUNTRIES WITH MORE CORRUPTION AND WEAKER RULE OF LAW. IN CONTRAST, RESPONDENTS EVALUATED PLAYERS AS SKILLED AND HONEST AND MATCH OFFICIALS AS COMPETENT AND HONEST. WE DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS FOR PERCEPTIONS OF CORRUPTION IN GENERAL.
895	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE INFLUENCES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS' EFFICIENCY THROUGH THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE. TO THIS EFFECT, THE STUDY EMPLOYS A TOBIT INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES TECHNIQUE WITH DATA FROM 22 AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2018. THE STATE ANTIQUITY INDEX, RECENTLY PROVIDED BY ANG AND FREDRIKSSON (2018), IS USED TO CAPTURE STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE WHEREAS RULE OF LAW, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE THE INDICATORS OF THE GOVERNANCE QUALITY. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, INFLUENCES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS' EFFICIENCY. THE NATURE OF THE DIRECT EFFECT IS NEGATIVE, WHILE THAT OF THE INDIRECT EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE GOVERNANCE INDICATOR CONSIDERED. INDEED, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE IS MODERATED BY THE STRICT APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND AMPLIFIED BY CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, AND EXCESSIVE REGULATION. THUS, TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE ON THE EFFICIENCY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, OLDER AFRICAN STATES SHOULD: I) PROMOTE STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ALTERNATION OF POWER, AND II) RELAX REGULATION AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION.
896	PURPOSE THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL ACCESS IN MODERATING THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON INSURANCE CONSUMPTION IN 42 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES USING DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2004-2014. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TWO LIFE INSURANCE INDICATORS ARE USED, NOTABLY: LIFE INSURANCE AND NON-LIFE INSURANCE. SIX GOVERNANCE MEASUREMENTS ARE ALSO USED, NAMELY: POLITICAL STABILITY, 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY', GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, CORRUPTION-CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE GENERALISED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) AND LEAST SQUARES DUMMY VARIABLE CORRECTED (LSDVC) ESTIMATORS. FINDINGS ESTIMATIONS FROM THE LSDVC ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT WHILE THE FOLLOWING MAIN FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED FROM THE GMM. FIRST, FINANCIAL ACCESS PROMOTES LIFE INSURANCE THROUGH CHANNELS OF POLITICAL STABILITY, 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY', GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL. SECOND, FINANCIAL ACCESS ALSO STIMULATES NON-LIFE INSURANCE VIA GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS OF POLITICAL STABILITY, 'VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY', GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATION QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION-CONTROL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS RESEARCH COMPLEMENTS THE SPARSE LITERATURE ON INSURANCE PROMOTION IN AFRICA BY ENGAGING THE HITHERTO UNEXPLORED ROLE OF FINANCIAL ACCESS THROUGH GOVERNANCE CHANNELS.
897	THE STUDY UTILIZES A FREQUENCY DOMAIN APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A GRANGER CAUSALITY RUNNING FROM GOVERNANCE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH EXISTS IN TWELVE ASIAN COUNTRIES, CLASSIFIED AS "FREE", "PARTLY FREE", AND "NOT FREE" COUNTRIES, OVER THE PERIOD OF 1996-2014. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOUTH KOREA, "FREE" COUNTRIES EXHIBITED NO SIGNIFICANT CAUSALITY RUNNING FROM MOST DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. FOR "PARTLY FREE" COUNTRIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INDONESIA AND THAILAND, RULE OF LAW GRANGER CAUSES ECONOMIC GROWTH. AS FOR "NOT FREE" COUNTRIES, THERE EXISTS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSALITY RUNNING FROM MOST DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE, ESPECIALLY FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW, TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. GENERALLY SPEAKING, VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE LEAD TO MORE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN "NOT FREE" COUNTRIES WHEN COMPARED TO "FREE" AND "PARTLY FREE" COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT POLICY MAKERS IN "NOT FREE" COUNTRIES SHOULD OPT TO PAY MORE ATTENTION ON THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE, SPECIFICALLY AROUND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW, IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE FUTURE GROWTH RATE OF REAL GDP PER CAPITA.

898	THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE AND EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BRAZILIAN JUDICIARY AND THE STATE OF EXCEPTION FROM THE LEGAL-DOGMATIC PERSPECTIVE. THE LAWFUL STATE OF EXCEPTION CONSISTS OF STATES OF DEFENSE AND SIEGE, CONSTITUTIONALLY RULED SITUATIONS, WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW. THE UNLAWFUL STATE OF EXCEPTION, ON THE OTHER HAND, STEMS FROM THE COMPLETE FAILURE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO COMPLY WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL MISSION, AND VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW. AN ERROR COMMITTED BY THE JUDICIARY IS NOT ENOUGH TO CONFIGURE THE UNLAWFUL STATE OF EXCEPTION, IN VIEW OF THE CALIBRATION RULE INHERENT TO THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING RES JUDICATA. A JURISDICTIONAL ERROR ONLY CONFIGURES A STATE OF EXCEPTION WHEN IT RESULTS FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL COLLAPSE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE CORRECT DISCLOSURE OF IMPLICIT NORMS OR THE CORRECT CONTROL OF DISCRETION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, WHICH ONLY OCCURS UPON DISRESPECT TO THE PROPER EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. RESISTANCE TO AN ERRONEOUS JURISDICTIONAL ACT IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AS A GENERAL RULE. HOWEVER, WHEN A JURISDICTIONAL ACT CONSTITUTES A SERIOUS INJUSTICE, RESISTANCE IS ALLOWED WITHOUT AMOUNTING TO A BREACH OF THE EXISTING LAW.
899	IN AFGHANISTAN, RULE OF LAW PROJECTS HAVE PLACED A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON REBUILDING COURTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT INSTITUTIONS. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE CRITICAL ELEMENT OF DEFENCE, PARTICULARLY CRIMINAL DEFENCE SERVICES FOR THE POOR. YET, WITHOUT DEFENCE LAWYERS, THERE CAN BE NO RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN AFGHANISTAN AND THE INDISPENSABLE ROLE THAT DEFENCE LAWYERS ARE PLAYING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, ILLUSTRATED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FOUNDATION. BY PROVIDING EARLY AND EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATION TO THEIR CLIENTS, LAWYERS ENSURE THAT AFGHANISTAN'S NEW LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED ARE IMPLEMENTED.
900	FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES (FRTS) REPRESENT ONE OF THE CUTTING-EDGE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BIG DATA FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES. THE USES OF THESE BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES ARE WIDESPREAD IN OUR CITIES. HOWEVER, THEY MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS ABUSES AGAINST THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE AND MINORITIES, OR EVEN IN NEW KINDS OF MASS SURVEILLANCE. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON "REAL-TIME" AND "LIVE" USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, ONE OF THE MOST DISCUSSED DEPLOYMENTS OF FRTS. THE ANALYSIS ADDRESSES, FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL POINT OF VIEW, WHETHER BANNING THESE TECHNOLOGIES IS INEVITABLE, OR WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REGULATE THEM IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEIR USE WHILE PROTECTING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AT STAKE AND PRESERVING DEMOCRATIC ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IS THE STANDARD FOR DEFINING APPROPRIATE REGULATORY MEASURES. THE ARTICLE STARTS OFF BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF HOW FRTS WORK AND SOME OF THE CONSEQUENT ETHICAL, TECHNICAL, SOCIETAL AND LEGAL CONCERNS THAT ARISE. IT THEN PROVIDES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF EU DATA PROTECTION LEGISLATION AND THE AI ACT PROPOSAL TO EXAMINE THEIR STRENGTHS AND SHORTCOMINGS IN ADDRESSING THE PROPORTIONATE USE OF FRTS.
901	A CENTRAL QUESTION IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS IS WHETHER THERE ARE ADEQUATE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THE EXECUTIVE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES CAUSAL EVIDENCE OF HOW INCREASING CONSTRAINTS ON THE EXECUTIVE-VIA REMOVAL OF PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION IN JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS-PRO-MOTES THE RULE OF LAW. THE AGE STRUCTURE OF JUDGES AT THE TIME OF THE REFORM AND THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE LAW PROVIDE US WITH AN EXOGENOUS SOURCE OF VARIATION IN THE TERMINATION OF PRESIDENTIAL DIS-CRETION IN JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES DETERIORATES THE RULE OF LAW. EVEN ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THE JUDICIARY AND THE PRESIDENT MATTERS. (JEL D72, K40, O17)
902	THE NECESSITY TO CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL EXTERNALITIES IS ALMOST INVARIABLY GIVEN AS JUSTIFICATION FOR COMMAND-AND-CONTROL REGULATION AND OTHER FORMS OF STATE INTERVENTION IN RELATED MARKETS. WHEN EVEN MENTIONED, COMMON LAW REMEDIES THAT PROTECTED ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS FOR CENTURIES ARE QUICKLY DISMISSED AS EITHER BEING UNWORKABLE OR INEFFECTIVE. A REVIEW OF THE COMMON LAW EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS. INDEED, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT COMMON LAW WAS TOO EFFECTIVE, WHICH LED TO SPECIAL INTEREST DEMAND FOR STATUTE LAW. THE RULE OF POLITICS MAY BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO RENT SEEKERS THAN THE RULE OF LAW AND MARKETS.
903	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DOCTRINAL SUPPORT FOR THESE COMPETING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ELEVENTH AMENDMENT AND LOOKS FOR WAYS TO RECONCILE THE TWO LINES OF CASES. IT ARGUES THAT MOST OF THE CASES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO SUPPORT THE ''FORUM-ALLOCATION'' INTERPRETATION WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ''IMMUNITY-FROM-LIABILITY'' INTERPRETATION IF READ TO ESTABLISH A RIGHT TO RELIEF AGAINST STATE OFFICIALS WHO VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW, AS OPPOSED TO THE STATES THEMSELVES. THE ARTICLE THEN CONSIDERS THE RULE-OF-LAW RAMIFICATIONS OF ADOPTING THE ''IMMUNITY-FROM-LIABILITY'' INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUDES THAT, AS LONG AS REMEDIES AGAINST STATE OFFICIALS REMAIN AVAILABLE, THE LATTER INTERPRETATION COMPORTS REASONABLY WELL WITH RULE-OF-LAW VALUES.
904	IN THIS STUDY, WE MODEL THE SCHUMPETERIAN GROWTH THEORY IN A SIMPLE DISCRETE-TIME FRAMEWORK IN WHICH BOTH ECONOMIES AND INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED. INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BORROW FROM AN IMPERFECT FINANCIAL MARKET TO DEVELOP AN ECONOMY. A GOVERNMENT CAN ADOPT TWO POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE BORROWING CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND, AS A RESULT, ENHANCING ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: THE RULE OF LAW' AND INDUSTRIAL POLICIES'. WE INTERPRET MARKET-ORIENTED REFORM IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES AS A SHIFT FROM INDUSTRIAL POLICIES', EXEMPLIFIED AT THE EXTREME BY THE TRADITIONAL PLANNED ECONOMY, TO THE RULE OF LAW'. THE PRESENTED MODEL SHOWS THAT BOTH STRATEGIES COULD BE THE BEST CHOICE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.
905	SEPARATIST VIOLENCE IN THE NORTHEAST AGAINST STATE TARGETS IS INCREASINGLY RARE. INSTEAD, VIOLENCE IS DIRECTED TOWARD INTER-COMMUNAL ATTACKS, INTERFERENCE IN REGIONAL POLITICS, AND CRIMINALITY. WEAK RULE OF LAW HAS ALLOWED SEPARATIST ORGANIZATIONS TO SURVIVE AS CRIMINAL RACKETS AND BY PROVIDING VIOLENCE TO POLITICIANS, EVEN AS THEY HAVE LOST POPULAR SUPPORT AND THE CENTER'S MILITARY PENETRATION OF THE NORTHEAST HAS ADVANCED. THERE IS A NEED FOR POLICY REEVALUATION IN LIGHT OF THE EVOLVING NATURE OF VIOLENCE IN THE REGION. BOTH POLITICAL AND MILITARY STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH SEPARATIST INSURGENCY DO NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS WEAKNESSES IN RULE OF LAW, THE TRUE SOURCE OF ONGOING TURMOIL IN THE REGION.
906	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE AFFECTED HONG KONG'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH RATE IN THE PAST 20 YR. WE FIND THAT DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY HAS DETERIORATED SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THE CHANGEOVER OF SOVEREIGNTY IN 1997, WHILE THE RULE OF LAW HAS REMAINED STRONG AND STABLE. EMPIRICAL RESULTS FROM AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG BOUNDS TESTS SHOW A POSITIVE LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWTH AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, AND GRANGER CAUSALITY TESTS REVEAL THAT DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY CAUSES THE GROWTH RATE OF GDP IN THE SHORT RUN. THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE ROBUST TO CONTROL FOR THE EFFECTS OF INVESTMENT AND THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 1997.
907	ACCORDING TO NEW GROWTH THEORIES, PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF SIX PUBLIC GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, INCLUDING VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DURING THE 2002-2013 PERIOD. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL GOVERNANCE INDICATORS EXCEPT REGULATORY QUALITY HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW HAD THE LARGEST IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHILE POLITICAL STABILITY HAD THE LOWEST IMPACT.
908	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAW AND SOCIAL NORMS AND IN PARTICULAR, THE CASE OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE IN GROUPS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS A SOCIAL NORM INTERFACING THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS OF SOCIETY WITH THE INFORMAL ONES. AS SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, NORMS SHOULD ALSO BE ANALYZED AT THE SOCIETAL LEVEL - A LEVEL OF ANALYSIS THAT NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMIC ACCOUNTS HAVE FAILED TO ADDRESS DUE TO FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES OF CURRENT ECONOMIC THEORY. THEORIES DEVELOPED IN PSYCHOLOGY PROVIDE A GOOD WORKING FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIAL NORM ANALYSIS IN GENERAL AND OF LEGAL COMPLIANCE (RULE OF LAW) IN PARTICULAR. EXTANT EVIDENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENT ARGUMENT.
909	IN THIS ARTICLE I PRESENT A CRITIQUE OF EFFORTS TO EXTEND THE "RULE OF LAW MODEL" TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY THE TRANSFER OF AMERICAN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. I EXAMINE A POPULAR AMERICAN LITERARY TEXT, STEVEN VINCENT BENET'S THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER, TO REVEAL A BASIC CONTRADICTION BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN AMERICAN LEGAL CULTURE. I ANALYZE THE RULE OF LAW MODEL AS A DISCOURSE, RELATING THE TRANSFER OF THESE CONTRADICTORY VALUES TO UNINTENDED RESULTS OF LEGAL REFORM RECENTLY REPORTED IN COSTA RICA. FINALLY, I PRESENT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW TRANSFERRING THE VALUES OF AMERICAN LEGAL CULTURE THROUGH LEGAL REFORMS IS RELATED TO JUDICIALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
910	INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-BANK FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURES HAS BROUGHT INCREASED CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR BAILOUTS AND THE RESULTANT MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO DERIVATIVES CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES. WE CONSIDER THE LAYERS OF PROTECTION THAT DERIVATIVES CENTRAL CLEARING PARTIES (CCPS) HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPECTATION OF REGULATORY RESCUE. WE THEN PROVIDE A MODEL OF THE TENSION BETWEEN THE DESIRE FOR EX POST RESCUE OF A SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN EX ANTE DISCIPLINE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE MODEL ILLUSTRATES THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD LEAD TO RELAXATION OR TIGHTENING OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATOR'S DISCRETION FOR RESCUE. WE CONSIDER EXAMPLES OF FAILURES OF DERIVATIVES CCPS IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS. (C) 2016 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.
911	JUSTICE JACKSON'S CONCURRING OPINION IN THE YOUNGSTOWN STEEL SEIZURE CASE IS SEEN AS A REJECTION OF UNLIMITED PRESIDENTIAL POWER AND A SUGGESTION THAT PRESIDENTS SHOULD, WHEN POSSIBLE, ACT WITH CONGRESS RATHER THAN UNILATERALLY. HOWEVER, HIS FAMOUS TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK CAN BE EXPLOITED. AFTER 9/11, BOTH THE BUSH AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS CLAIMED STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION WHEN NONE EXISTED IN ORDER TO LEND LEGITIMACY TO WHAT WERE IN FACT UNILATERAL ACTIONS AND/OR FOUND WAYS AROUND CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS. IN MOST CASES, CONGRESS AND THE COURTS FAILED TO SET MEANINGFUL LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE POWER. THE RESULT IS THAT NATIONAL SECURITY POWER HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF THE PRESIDENT, CLOAKED BY THE DUBIOUS CLAIM THAT PRESIDENTS ARE ACTING PURSUANT TO STATUTORY AUTHORITY. CONGRESS AND THE COURTS CAN AND SHOULD GIVE MEANING TO JACKSON'S TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK BY REJECTING IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIMS THAT EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTION IS SUPPORTED BY STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND BY APPLYING CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS TO JOINT ACTION BY THE ELECTED BRANCHES. THIS WOULD RESTORE MEANING TO THE TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO DEFINE AND SET LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE POWER.
912	FEMINIST TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ) HAS GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE STUDY OF JUSTICE IN THE RUINS OF WAR, NOTABLY AROUND PROSECUTING WARTIME RAPE. AT THE SAME TIME, SCHOLARS HAVE OBSERVED LIMITATIONS TO THIS RESEARCH AGENDA SUCH AS EXTERNALLY-DRIVEN DEFINITIONS GENDERED HARMS AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. THIS PAPER EXPLORES TWO NOVEL AREAS FOR FEMINIST TJ RESEARCH: 'EVERYDAY GENDERED HARMS' AND CUSTOMARY JUSTICE. BASED ON A THREE MONTH FIELD STUDY OF BARAZA, A CUSTOMARY JUSTICE MECHANISM IN PARTS OF SOUTH KIVU, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, I EXPLORE THREE CASES OF 'EVERYDAY' HARMS AGAINST WOMEN: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, POLYGYNOUS RELATIONSHIPS AND WITCHCRAFT. THROUGH A SUBSTANTIVE EXAMINATION OF THESE BARAZA CASES, I HIGHLIGHT HOW STUDYING THE CONTEXTUALISED FUNCTIONING OF CUSTOMARY JUSTICE MECHANISMS PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS INTO DIFFERENT AREAS OF FEMINIST TJ SCHOLARSHIP, INCLUDING WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE TRANSITION, JUSTICE FOR HARMS AGAINST WOMEN, AND ADVANCING GENDER EQUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PAPER ADDS TO THE BROADER TJ LITERATURE BY ENGAGING WITH LOCAL TJ NEEDS AS THEY PERTAIN TO PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIFE IN TRANSITION.
913	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE POSITION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE MODERN STATE AND THE SCIENCE OF ADMINISTRATION AMONG OTHER SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. THE RESEARCH SUBJECT OF THE ARTICLE IS PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION PRESENTED - IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE SCIENCE OF ADMINISTRATION - AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT CONSTITUTES A PARTICULAR SYSTEM. ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTOOD IN THIS WAY IS DEEMED AS A LEGAL PHENOMENON. THE ESSENCE OF ADMINISTRATION, REGARDLESS OF THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE STATE, IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY. THIS MEANS THAT ITS STRUCTURE AND FORMS OF ACTION ARE STRICTLY REGULATED BY THE LAW. THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS IMPACTED BY VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. MOREOVER, THE INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO VERY DIVERSE. THE ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, DESPITE BEING AN OBJECT OF INTEREST OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES, IS PRIMARILY AN OBJECT OF RESEARCH WITHIN THE LAW. THE FIRST BASIC CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM THE ARTICLE IS TO INDICATE THAT, DUE TO ADMINISTRATION'S CONNECTION TO THE LAW AND THE REQUIREMENT TO USE ONLY THOSE FORMS OF ACTION THAT ARE PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW, THE PRIMARY DISCIPLINE WITHIN WHICH WE SHALL ANALYZE THE RULES OF THE FUNCTIONING OF ADMINIS-TRATION IS THE LAW. ON THIS BASIS, A SECOND CONCLUSION IS PRESENTED THAT THE SCIENCE OF ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A SUBDISCIPLINE OF THE LAW. IN ADDITION, ADMINISTRATION IS A SCIENTIFIC SUBDISCIPLINE THAT, USING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF EXTRALEGAL SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES, WILL ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EXPEDIENCY OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S ACTION, HOWEVER BASED ON THE BOUNDARIES SET BY LAW.
914	ON 16 FEBRUARY 2022, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) RULED IN PLENARY COMPOSITION ON THE ACTIONS FOR ANNULMENT BROUGHT BY HUNGARY AND POLAND AGAINST REGULATION 2020/2092. THE ECJ UPHELD THE REGULATION, AFFIRMING ITS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE TREATIES AND EUROPEAN UNION (EU) LAW. IN DOING SO THE COURT DELIVER TWO JUDGMENTS OF SEMINAL CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING FOR THE EUROPEAN UNION: BUILDING ON ITS PREVIOUS JURISPRUDENCE ON EU PRINCIPLES AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND ON THE BASIS OF THE TEXT OF THE REGULATION, THE COURT TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER A SYSTEMIC AND NORMATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EU VALUES OF ART.2 TEU, DEFINING EU IDENTITY AND SETTING A SOLID PRECEDENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE EU VALUES VIS-A-VIS THE MEMBER STATES THAT DELIBERATELY CHALLENGE THOSE VALUES. HOWEVER, SUCH CONSTITUTIONAL RELEVANCE MUST BE ASSESSED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE EU: EVEN IN LIGHT OF THIS POSSIBLE TRANSFORMATION FOSTERED BY THE DECISIONS AT HAND, WE MUST BE AWARE THAT THE EU CAN PROTECT ITS OWN IDENTITY BUT ONLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CONFERRED COMPETENCIES. THE FOLLOWING COMMENTARY AIMS TO ADDRESS THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONDITIONALITY JUDGMENTS WITH REGARD TO FOUR MAIN ASPECTS THAT EMERGE FROM THE DECISIONS: THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE REGULATION AND THE ISSUE OF EU CONFERRED COMPETENCIES; THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISIONS FOR THE NORMATIVE NATURE OF THE VALUES OF ART.2 TEU; THE LINK BETWEEN SOLIDARITY AND CONDITIONALITY AND FINALLY, THE FUTURE AND GENERAL IMPACTS OF THE DECISIONS FOR THE EU INTEGRATION PROCESS.
915	THE DRAFT EUROPEAN CONSTITUTION CRAFTED IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF 9/11 IN NEW YORK AND THOSE TAKEN PLACE IN MOSCOW, MADRID, WAS CONCLUDED SHORTLY BEFORE THE ATTACKS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN LONDON IN 2005, INCLUDING WHAT IS CALLED A SOLIDARITY CLAUSE (ART. 42) AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION MODALITIES (ART. III-329), HOWEVER AFTER VARIOUS VICISSITUDES, IT WAS NEVER RATIFIED BY THE MEMBER STATES AND FELT INTO OBLIVION; WHILE IT REMAINED A DRIVING FORCE IN THE SUBSEQUENT LISBON TREATY IN FORCE SINCE 2009 AS, SECTION 222 IN THE FIFTH PART UNDER TITLE VII.
916	THE MILITARY DETENTION FACILITY AT THE GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE IS THE MOST ENDURING MANIFESTATION OF THE US "WAR ON TERROR." IT IS ALSO MATERIALLY AND SYMBOLICALLY CENTRAL TO US TORTURE, WAR CRIMES, AND OTHER EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF LAW IN THE POST-9/11 ERA. SINCE THE FIRST DETAINEES ARRIVED IN 2002, GUANTANAMO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONTROVERSY AND DEBATE, AS WELL AS A KEY SETTING FOR LEGAL CHALLENGES TO GOVERNMENT POLICIES. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE LEGACY OF THE PRISON AND THE MILITARY COMMISSIONS ACROSS FOUR ADMINISTRATIONS. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE LACK OF A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OR SHARED NARRATIVE ABOUT WHAT GUANTANAMO MEANS OR HAS MEANT IS A PRODUCT OF ENTRENCHED PARTISANSHIP THAT CHARACTERIZES CONTEMPORARY US POLITICS MORE BROADLY. GUANTANAMO'S CONFOUNDING LEGACY REFLECTS THE LACK OF A NATIONAL CONSENSUS ABOUT THE ROLE OF LAWS AND COURTS AS GUARANTORS OF EVEN THE MOST BASIC RIGHTS.
917	DESCRIPTION: THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONSIDER THE PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION ON THE FUNCTIONING OF COURT DECISIONS AS ONE OF THE TYPES OF COURT DECISIONS. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS COURT RULINGS IN THE CIVIL PROCEDURE OF UKRAINE. THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF JUDGMENTS IN CIVIL PROCEEDINGS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE BASIS OF THE COMPLEX USE OF GENERAL SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIAL METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, NAMELY: DIALECTICAL, FORMAL AND DOGMATIC, SYSTEM ANALYSIS, SYSTEM AND STRUCTURAL, HERMENEUTIC, LEGAL AND COMPARATIVE, LEGAL AND MODELING, METHOD OF THEORETICAL GENERALIZATION. RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH. THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF COURT DECISIONS IS ANALYZED. THE NOTION OF A COURT DECISION, A COURT DECISION IS DEFINED, AND ALSO THE PROVISIONS OF NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS ON THIS ISSUE ARE CONSIDERED. THE FEATURES INHERENT IN A COURT DECISION AND A COURT DECISION IN PARTICULAR, AS WELL AS THE RULES FOR ISSUING COURT DECISIONS ARE CONSIDERED. PRACTICAL MEANING. THE CLEAR SYSTEM OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A COURT DECISION AS A PROCEDURAL DOCUMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT IS ESTABLISHED. VALUE / ORIGINALITY. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO REVEAL THE ESSENCE OF THE COURT DECISION AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE MECHANISM FOR REGULATING LEGAL RELATIONS.
918	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES BOTH THEORETICALLY AND HISTORICALLY THE CORE FEATURES OF AUTHORITARIAN ADJUDICATION. IT ATTEMPTS TO OFFER AN IDEAL TYPE OF WHAT COULD MEAN A FULL ASSERTION OF AUTHORITARIANISM IN THE CONTEXT OF ADJUDICATION. IT AIMS TO DO SO BY FIRST HIGHLIGHTING THE VALUE OF INSIGHTS THAT CRITICAL LEGAL HISTORY CAN BRING TO THE CURRENT DISCUSSION OF POPULISM. SECOND, IT EXPLORES THE PARADIGM OF THE EXCEPTION THAT IT AIMS TO REVISE AND GROUND IN A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INTERWAR PERIOD. THIRD, IT CONSIDERS THE INTELLECTUAL AND PRACTICAL LINES OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN CURRENT REACTIONS TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE HISTORICAL ROLE OF THE MILITARY IN MODERNITY BY DRAWING ON THE EXAMPLE OF ROMANIA. IN A FINAL PART, IT PROVIDES A REFLECTION ON THE CONFUSION BETWEEN LAW, POLITICS, AND MILITARY CONCERNS AS A SPECIFIC FEATURE OF MODERN AUTHORITARIANISM.
919	FROM INITIALLY DEFINING NEW GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AS EXTERNAL TO "TRADITIONAL" FORMS OF EU LAW, A NUMBER OF ACADEMIC SCHOLARS HAVE BEGUN TO ARGUE THAT METHODS LIKE THE OMC CAN BE SEEN AS INDICATIVE OF A BROADER "TRANSFORMATION" OF EUROPEAN LAW-MAKING. THE TRANSFORMATION THESIS RELIES ON SEEING THE OMC AS AN EVOLVING LEGAL MECHANISM, IN WHICH FEATURES SUCH AS PEER REVIEW, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF 'NEW' CONSTITUTIONAL ACTORS, CAN TAKE THE PLACE OF TRADITIONAL FORMS OF LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND PARTICIPATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE TRANSFORMATION THESIS REMAINS EMPIRICALLY UNDER-DEVELOPED. TAKING THE NEW STREAMLINED OMC PROCESS IN SOCIAL INCLUSION AND SOCIAL PROTECTION AS ITS STARTING POINT, THIS PAPER WILL SEEK TO REMEDY THAT GAP. THE PAPER EVALUATES THE TRANSFORMATION THESIS USING INTERVIEW DATA GAINED FROM THE RECENT COMMISSION EVALUATION OF THE OMC SPSI ( CONDUCTED FROM 2005-2006). WHILE THE OMC SPSI DISPLAYS EVIDENCE FOR A NUMBER OF ITS FEATURES - IT ALSO DISPLAYS SOME OF THE LIMITS OF THE 'TRANSFORMATION' IDEA. WHILE THE OMC AS IT STANDS INDICATES ELEMENTS OF A MORE 'DYNAMIC' FORM OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUBSIDIARITY IN THE EU ORDER, ITS LACK OF CRITICAL REVIEW AND TRANSPARENCY, AND FAILURE TO INCLUDE LOCAL OR REGIONAL ACTORS CASTS DOUBT ON ITS SUITABILITY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR TRADITIONAL LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS. AS MUCH AS 'TRANSFORMATION' MAY OFFER AN ATTRACTIVE FUTURE FOR EU LAW, ITS DYNAMIC VISION FOR OPEN COORDINATION REMAINS LARGELY UNREALISED.
920	AN IDEAL CITIZEN CENTRIC SOCIETY WEDDED TO THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE ALWAYS KEEPS ITS LAWS IN MOTION TO BUILD AN EGALITARIAN AND JUST ORDER. AESTHETIC VIRTUE OF LAW LIES IN THE REALISATION OF JUSTICE AND THE CREATION OF AN EGALITARIAN ORDER. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE APPROACH OF THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA (SCI) TOWARDS COVID-19 PANDEMIC THROUGH SUO MOTU PROCEEDINGS FROM VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES OF JURISPRUDENCE AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED TO HAVE STRIVED INTENSIVELY WITH FULL VIGOUR BUT THE RESPONSE DUE TOLACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND INTENSE GRAVITY OF THE CATASTROPHE, THE EFFORTS OF THE GOVERNMENT APPEARED NEGLIGIBLE. IT WARRANTED PROMPT REVISIT OF PRIORITIES WHICH COMPELLED THE SCI TO INTERVENE AND EVALUATE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE EXECUTIVE ACTION. FURTHERMORE, IT IMPELLED TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF THE SCI IN RESPONDING TO THE COMMUNITY'S SENSE OF JUSTICE AND HUMANISING JUSTICE. THE PAPER PRESENTS THE SOLUTION TO THE PARADOX GENERATED OUT OF THE INHERENT FRICTION BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND RESISTANCE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS BY A POPULIST GOVERNMENT. THE SCOPE OF THE DISCUSSION HAS PRIMARILY BEEN CONFINED TO ORDERS OF THE SCI IN SUO MOTU HEARINGS AND EXAMINED ACCORDINGLY.
921	THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON THE NORMATIVE ACTS ISSUED BY THE BOLSONARO GOVERNMENT, WHICH ALTERED THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY MANAGEMENT COUNCILS' THAT MAKE UP THE FEDERAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE ADOPTED METHOD IS THE ANALYTICAL-DEDUCTIVE ONE, FROM THE THEORETICAL REFLECTION OF THE CURRENT LEGISLATION ON THE MANAGEMENT COUNCILS AND THE LITERATURE DEALING WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE AND THE AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM. THE OUTCOME OF THE PROPOSED ANALYSIS IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S NORMATIVE ACTS ON THE NATIONAL MANAGEMENT COUNCILS VIOLATE THE DEMOCRATIC PARAMETERS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, CONSTITUTING ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM.
922	THE CONCEPT OF GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS (GNH) - OR THE IDEA THAT A NATION'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY SHOULD HAVE AS ITS GOAL THE MAXIMIZATION OF A PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS, RATHER THAN THE MAXIMIZATION OF THEIR ECONOMIC OUTPUT - IS APPEALINGLY PERSUASIVE IN ITS HUMANISTIC SIMPLICITY. WHEN HE FIRST ARTICULATED THE CONCEPT IT IN 1979, THE 4TH DRUK GYALPO (HEREDITARY KING) OF BHUTAN SIGNALED TO THE WORLD THAT BHUTAN'S INTEGRATION INTO THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY MUST NOT BE PREMISED ON THE BLIND ACCEPTANCE OF STANDARD DEFINITIONS OF DEVELOPMENT 'PROGRESS,' BUT THAT INSTEAD THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INSIST ON ITS OWN DEFINITION OF SUCCESS - FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT ALSO ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, PRESERVATION OF CULTURE AND COMMUNITIES, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. IN RETROSPECT, BHUTAN'S INSISTENCE ON THE LATTER COURSE SEEMS PARTICULARLY PRESCIENT. TODAY, GNH IS SEEN AS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF SO-CALLED ALTERNATIVE VISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND IS ATTRACTING GLOBAL ATTENTION FROM A GROWING NUMBER OF POLICY MAKERS, DIPLOMATS, SCHOLARS, TOURISTS, JOURNALISTS, AND EVEN RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED TRUTH-SEEKERS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF GNH FOR BHUTAN'S LAWMAKERS, LAWYERS, LEGAL ACADEMICS, AND FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS. THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON LAW AND DEVELOPMENT, BUT FLIPS THE ANALYSIS TO SPECULATE NOT ON HOW LEGAL REFORMS DO (OR DO NOT) PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BUT RATHER HOW A UNIQUE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY MIGHT IN TURN INFLUENCE THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL SECTOR.
923	THE CONSTITUTION OF A STATE IN DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT IN WHAT IS INDONESIA TODAY IS JUST ONE OF THE POSSIBLE STORIES OF HISTORY. TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE AND WHAT WILL DETERMINE INDONESIA'S FUTURE AND TRANSFORMATIONS, THIS PAPER OFFERS AN APPROACH TO THE STRUCTURING AXIS OF INDONESIA'S NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION; IT ALSO ANALYSES THE PROCESS THAT LED TO THE REPLACING OF THE POLITICAL REGIME ESTABLISHED BY SUKARNO AFTER INDEPENDENCE BY SUHARTO'S "NEW ORDER", AND ITS CONSOLIDATION AND CRISIS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO POLITICAL TRANSITION, THEN TO THE PRESENT DEMOCRATIC REGIME IN CONSOLIDATION AND TO THE OVERCOMING OF INDONESIA'S HISTORICAL CHALLENGES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AND THE CHALLENGES INDONESIA FACES IN THE FUTURE.
924	DO WE FACE A RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY LAW? THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO LAW THAT IS FAIRLY APPLIED AND ENFORCED. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS REQUIRES THAT THOSE BOUND BY THE LAW NOT BE THE JUDGES IN THEIR OWN CASE. DOES NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYERING MEET THIS STANDARD? AND IF NOT, WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THAT? THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. IT BEGINS BY DEMONSTRATING A KEY SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM: THERE ARE ALMOST NO EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS ON NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYERING. CONGRESS AND THE COURTS HAVE MOSTLY OPTED OUT OF MAKING DECISIONS IN CASES INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY, OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO DISCIPLINE A HEGEMON, AND THE PRESS AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ARE CONSTRAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE MATTERS ON WHICH THEY SEEK TRANSPARENCY ARE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, CLASSIFIED, AND THUS REVEALING THEM IS A CRIME. IN SHORT, THE ORDINARY CHECKS DO NOT APPLY. THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL OVERSIGHT MEANS THAT THOSE INTERPRETING THE LAW ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THE LAWYERS FOR THE VERY SAME ACTORS REGULATED BY THAT LAW MEMBERS OF THE U.S. EXECUTIVE BRANCH. DRAWING ON HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYERS FROM THE LAST FOUR PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATIONS, THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE GROUP OF LAWYERS MOST CENTRALLY INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING NATIONAL SECURITY LAW QUESTIONS, NOW KNOWN AS "THE LAWYERS GROUP." EVEN AT ITS BEST, THE LAWYERS GROUP PROCESS WAS INSUFFICIENT TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IN APPARENTLY IGNORING MANY OF THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL SECURITY AUTHORITY, HAS LAID BARE PROBLEMS THAT EXISTED ALL ALONG. IN DOING SO, IT HAS CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN NATIONAL SECURITY LAWYERING AS WE MOVE INTO A NEW PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION. IT IS UP TO US TO SEIZE IT.
925	MARKET-INALIENABILITY HAS A CENTRAL PLACE IN DEVELOPED SOCIETIES THAT EMBRACE PRIVATE LAW INSTITUTIONS AND A TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE POLITY IN UNDERWRITING, MANAGING, AND PRESERVING THOSE INSTITUTIONS. MARKET-INALIENABILITY IS A FORM OF NON-COMMODIFICATION. TAKING UP THE ISSUE OF WHAT THINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE TREATED AS COMMODITIES, I FIRST CRITIQUE A MODE OF INQUIRY-A TRADITIONAL VIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS-THAT FINDS NO PROBLEM WITH COMMODIFICATION OF ANYTHING WHATSOEVER. COUNTER TO THIS MODE OF REASONING, I REVIEW TWO POINTS OF VIEW THAT CONSIDER SOME KINDS OF COMMODIFICATION WRONGFUL. FINDING NEITHER OF THESE ANTI-COMMODIFICATION THEORIES SATISFACTORY, I REVIEW IN SOME DETAIL THE EXAMPLE OF BABY-SELLING TO SHOW THE DILEMMAS OF COMMODIFICATION AND THE COMPLEXITY OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT. I THEN TURN TO THE PRACTICE OF STANDARDIZED FINE-PRINT CONTRACTS ("BOILERPLATE") THAT ROUTINELY WAIVE THE BACKGROUND LEGAL RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE THEM. THIS PRACTICE OF USING CONTRACT TO ESCAPE BASIC RIGHTS COMMODIFIES SOME RIGHTS THAT OUGHT TO BE MARKET-INALIENABLE. SUCH RIGHTS SHOULD REMAIN PERMANENTLY IN THE CARE OF THE POLITY AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS OBJECTS OF TRADE.
926	THIS ARTICLE ELUCIDATES THE MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING THE ROLE AND MANDATE OF TAX ADMINISTRATIONS AND THE CONSEQUENTIAL CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES THAT THESE EVENTS POSE TO DEMOCRACY, IN PARTICULAR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, THERE HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE EVOLUTION WHEREBY TAX ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE MOVED FROM BEING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, STATED DIFFERENTLY, ENFORCING TAX LAWS, AND COLLECTING TAX REVENUES, TOWARDS BEING PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE EMERGENCY MANDATES THAT WERE ENACTED AMIDST IT FACILITATED VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE TAX ADMINISTRATION, TO GAIN GREATER NUMBERS OF MANDATES AND TO OPERATE WITHOUT BOUNDARIES DUE TO THE ONGOING CRISIS. HOWEVER, THE EXTENSION OF THE MANDATE GIVEN TO TAX ADMINISTRATIONS WAS ALREADY NOTICEABLE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WITH SWEDEN BEING ONE GOOD EXAMPLE, A PRE-EXISTING PROCESS THAT THE AUTHOR ARGUES HAS BEEN ENABLED AND EXACERBATED BY THE LAST THREE DECADES OF INTERNATIONAL TAX DEVELOPMENTS AT THE OECD AND EU LEVELS IN CONNECTION TO THE REGULATION OF INTERNATIONAL TAX COMPETITION AND HARMFUL TAX PRACTICES. SWEDEN IS USED AS A CASE STUDY, BUT THE FINDINGS ARE APPLICABLE TO A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE TOPIC AND SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSIONS.
927	RESPECT FOR THE VALUES LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU) WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS THAT LED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (FRA). WHILE NEITHER THE TREATIES NOR THE REGULATION ESTABLISHING FRA ENVISAGE AN EXPLICIT ROLE FOR THE FRA WITH RESPECT TO ARTICLE 7 TEU, ITS ASSISTANCE MAY BE SOUGHT IN THIS CONTEXT EVEN THOUGH THE CONTOURS OF SUCH AN EVENTUAL ASSISTANCE REMAINS TO BE CLARIFIED. BY CONTRAST, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION MAY APPROACH THE FRA SHOULD THE COMMISSION REQUIRE ITS ASSISTANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK IT ADOPTED IN 2014. THE COUNCIL AND THE PARLIAMENT COULD SIMILARLY REQUIRE THE FRA'S ASSISTANCE. IT IS HOWEVER SUBMITTED THAT A MORE STRUCTURED DIALOGUE AND THE REGULAR PROVISION OF DATA AND ANALYSIS, INCLUDING VIA THE FRA, WOULD MAKE THE EU SYSTEM OF MONITORING RESPECT FOR EU VALUES WITHIN THE EU ITSELF MORE OPERATIONAL AND HELP PREVENT DOUBLE STANDARDS.
928	FOLLOWING THE WORK OF MORLINO (2012) AND KATZ AND MORLINO (2012), WE EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN VENEZUELA UNDER HUGO CHAVEZ. WE ARGUE THAT BY THE END OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, VENEZUELA BECAME A HYBRID REGIME. IN THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH OPERATED AS A DEMOCRACY, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY WAS LOW; IN OTHER INSTANCES, THE REGIME EXHIBITED CLEAR AUTOCRATIC FEATURES.
929	HAYEK'S THE ROAD TO SERFDOM HAS BEEN INTERPRETED AS A GENERAL WARNING AGAINST STATE INTERVENTION IN THE ECONOMY.(1) WE REVIEW THIS ARGUMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH HAYEK'S LATER WORK AND DISCERN AN INSTITUTIONAL THESIS ABOUT WHICH FORMS OF STATE INTERVENTION AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS COULD THREATEN PERSONAL AND POLITICAL FREEDOM. ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS POSE A THREAT IF THEY ALLOW FOR COERCIVE INTERVENTIONS, AS DESCRIBED BY HAYEK IN THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY: BY GIVING SOMEONE THE POWER TO FORCE OTHERS TO SERVE ONE'S WILL BY THREATENING TO INFLICT HARM, IN THE ABSENCE OF GENERAL RULES OF CONDUCT. ACCORDING TO THE LOGIC OF THE ARGUMENT, WELFARE-STATE PROVISIONS ARE NOT COERCIVE INSOFAR AS THEY DO NOT ALLOW THE IDENTIFICATION AND DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS. BY CONTRAST, WE CLAIM THAT A STRUCTURE OF COERCION IS LIKELY TO EMERGE FROM THE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL NATURE OF PROTECTIONIST INSTITUTIONS AND IMMIGRATION RESTRICTIONS CURRENTLY ADVOCATED BY THE RADICAL RIGHT.
930	SUBJECT AND SCOPE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WORK IS TO ANALYZE THE IMPORTANCE OF LABOR LAW AS APPLIED IN COLOMBIA, AND HOW IT HAS HAD AN INTERNATIONAL IMPACT. IT EXAMINES BOTH ITS ORIGIN AND ITS LINK WITH THE COLOMBIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE 1991 CONSTITUTION IN THIS AREA. CHARACTERISTICS: THE PAPER BEGINS BY EXPLORING THE BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH ON LABOR ISSUES IN COLOMBIA AND THEN DELVES INTO THE ISSUE OF REINFORCED LABOR STABILITY FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR COLOMBIA TO FURTHER INCORPORATE INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ON LABOR MATTERS, WITHOUT RESORTING TO TUTELA AS A PROTECTION MECHANISM. FINDINGS: BASED ON THE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE, IT IS EVIDENT THAT COLOMBIA HAS A LONG WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF THE INCORPORATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES IN LABOR MATTERS. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT RESORTING TO TUTELA AS THE ONLY FORM OF PROTECTION IS EMPHASIZED. CONCLUSIONS: COLOMBIA IS A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW IN CONSTANT GROWTH, AND IN THIS PROCESS IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PROTECTION OF THE LABOR RIGHTS OF WOMEN, WHO ARE SUBJECTS OF PROTECTION AND MUST ENJOY THEIR RIGHTS.
931	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE TRANSITION OF LIBERATION MOVEMENTS INTO POLITICAL PARTIES AND WHETHER THAT GUARANTEES GOOD GOVERNANCE OR NOT. SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE COLD WAR, THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATIC STATES HAS INCREASED ON ALL CONTINENTS. AFRICAN STATES BEGAN TO EXPLORE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE FROM INDEPENDENCE AND THE END OF APARTHEID. FURTHERMORE, THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE FOUGHT BY MANY AFRICAN MOVEMENTS LED TO INDEPENDENCE AND 'DECOLONISATION'. THE EMERGENCE OF THESE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS WAS TO EMANCIPATE AND LIBERATE THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES SO THAT THE RULE OF OPPRESSIVE IMPERIALISTS SUCH AS THE BRITISH COULD COME TO AN END. THE TRANSITION OF THE FORMER COLONIAL STATES ENSURED THAT THE MOVEMENTS WHICH FOUGHT THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE TURNED INTO POLITICAL PARTIES. THE STUDY USES THE CASES OF THE ZIMBABWE AFRICAN NATIONAL-PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF) IN ZIMBABWE AND THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS (ANC) IN SOUTH AFRICA TO INTERROGATE THE TRANSITION INTO POLITICAL PARTIES AND EXAMINE IF GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BECAUSE OF THAT. THE STUDY HAS FOUND THAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF FORMER LIBERATION MOVEMENTS TURNING INTO POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE NOT HAD THE FORESEEN INTENTIONS. WITH THE NEOPATRIMONIAL THEORY, THE STUDY SUBSTANTIALLY EXAMINES WHETHER ZANU-PF AND THE ANC HAVE BEEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OR AGAINST THE DYNAMICS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE INFORMED BY LIBERALISM VALUES.
932	THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THIS ARTICLE LIES IN ITS CONCEPTUAL FRAMING WHICH IS A CONTEXTUALISATION OF THE PROBLEM OF EXCEPTION IN THE COLONIAL AND 'POSTCOLONIAL' PERIOD OF CAMEROON. THE COUNTRY WAS TECHNICALLY COLONISED BY GERMANY AND FOLLOWING THE VERSAILLES TREATY, WAS LATER TRANSFERRED TO FRANCE AND BRITAIN UNDER A MANDATE OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. FOLLOWING LEGAL AND HISTORICAL INVESTIGATIONS, I ASSESS HOW THE PERMANENT RECOURSE TO A STATE OF EXCEPTION WITHIN THE COLONY WAS CENTRAL TO EUROPEANS' TACTICS IN THEIR STRATEGIES OF CONTROL AND DOMINATION OF COLONISED PEOPLE. I FURTHER EXAMINE HOW THE COUNTRY'S COLONIAL PAST STRONGLY INFLUENCES CURRENT STATE STRUCTURES THROUGH A BASIC RELIANCE ON EMERGENCY LAWS WHICH HAVE BECOME NORMALISED TO A POINT WHERE THE LAW'S FORCE HAS BEEN REDUCED TO THE ZERO POINT OF ITS OWN CONTENT.
933	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ENGAGEMENT FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS EXAMINE CSR ENGAGEMENT ACROSS 83 DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES FOCUSING ON FOUR POTENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS: THE RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION AND EXPOSURE TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE LEVEL OF HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CSR ENGAGEMENT IN BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW WAS ONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CSR ENGAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES WHEREAS THE LEVEL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WAS FOUND HAVING NO ASSOCIATION WITH CSR ENGAGEMENT ACROSS BOTH DEVELOPED ECONOMIES AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE EFFECT OF MACROINSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES ON AGGREGATE CSR ENGAGEMENT PRACTICES ACROSS 83 DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES WAS EXAMINED; HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS DID NOT ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE RELEVANCE OF THESE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AT THE MICRO OR MEZZO LEVEL AND HOW THEY INTERPLAY WITH FIRM-LEVEL FACTORS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY OFFER SOME IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS THAT IMPACT CSR ENGAGEMENT FROM BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED ECONOMY CONTEXTS. NOT ONLY WILL THESE FINDINGS ENCOURAGE REGULATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CALL FOR ENHANCED CSR ENGAGEMENT, IT WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE ACCOUNTING AND ASSURANCE PROFESSION'S EFFORTS TO EVALUATE ORGANIZATIONAL RISK AND MITIGATE CORPORATE OPPORTUNISTIC USE OF CSR DISCLOSURE. THE FINDING THAT STRENGTHENING A COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW ENHANCES CSR ENGAGEMENT IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES IS FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE CURRENT DEBATE IN THE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE REGARDING MANDATING FIRM CSR DISCLOSURE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION AND ENCOURAGING FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE OVERALL SOCIAL WELL-BEING OF ALL ECONOMIES, WHEREAS DEVELOPING ECONOMIES CAN FURTHER ENCOURAGE CSR ENGAGEMENT BY ENHANCING THEIR RULE OF LAW.
934	WE ARE LIVING IN THE AGE OF ONLINE INFORMATION. KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION ARE INCREASINGLY ACCESSED THROUGH THE INTERNET, AND THE CATCH-CRY 'I'LL JUST GOOGLE THAT!' NOW HAS A FIRM PLACE IN THE VERNACULAR. FOUNDED IN 1998, GOOGLE.COM HAS HAD UNPRECEDENTED SUCCESS IN CHANGING THE WAY WE LOOK FOR AND FIND ONLINE INFORMATION. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES RESULTS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ON HOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THE PROCESS OF ACCESSING FAMILY LAW INFORMATION IN A POST-SEPARATION CONTEXT. IT DISCUSSES THREE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THIS EXPERIENCE REVEALED IN THE DATA, WHICH ARE ANALYSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPACT AND USE OF GOOGLE AND OTHER SEARCH ENGINES AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE. THE ARTICLE OFFERS SOME INSIGHTS ABOUT HOW BEST TO MAKE USEFUL LEGAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO NON-LAWYERS.
935	THE THREAT OF TERRORISM AND RISKS OF RADICALIZATION PERVADE MODERN LIFE. UNIVERSITIES ARE NO EXCEPTION, ESPECIALLY AS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE TO RECRUITMENT BY EXTREMIST GROUPS. NONETHELESS, THE DECISION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) GOVERNMENT TO PLACE UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE STATUTORY PREVENT DUTY,' REQUIRING THEM TO HAVE DUE REGARD TO THE NEED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING DRAWN INTO TERRORISM,' IS CONTROVERSIAL. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND TO THIS NOVEL DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY OF HARD AND SOFT POWER SECURITY STRATEGIES. IT ASKS WHY UNIVERSITIES IN THE UK HAVE BEEN CO-OPTED AS AGENTS OF COUNTERTERRORISM AND REFLECTS ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PREVENT DUTY FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, NOT LEAST FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM. IT CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING WHETHER THIS SECURITY OBLIGATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LARGER ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
936	IN ADDRESSING WHETHER THE FIELD OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY DEMANDS INTERNAL SELF-REGULATION OR EXTERNAL STATE INTERVENTION, THE AUTHORS LOOK AT THE DISTINCT YET AT ONCE INTERRELATED NOTIONS OF ETHICS, DEONTOLOGY AND LAW. THE DISTINCTNESS OF THESE CONCEPTS RELATES NOT ONLY TO THEIR OPTIONAL AND/OR OBLIGATORY NATURES, BUT ALSO TO THE GROUP AND/OR GROUPS THEY INFLUENCE AND/OR REGULATE. THE INTERRELATED NATURE OF THESE CONCEPTS SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE COMPLIMENTARY PARADIGMS IN AS MUCH AS THEY COLLECTIVELY FORM A FRAMEWORK OF INDIVIDUAL, PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIETAL NORMS. GIVEN THE EMERGENCE OF BOTH LEGAL PLURALISM AND SELF-REGULATION OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, IT IS BELIEVED THAT NEITHER SELF-REGULATION NOR STATE INTERVENTION IS IN ITSELF APPROPRIATE. RATHER, IT IS CONTENDED THAT ONLY A PLURALISTIC SYSTEM-INCORPORATING ETHICS, DEONTOLOGY (SELF-REGULATORY MODELS) AND LAW (STATE REGULATORY MODEL) CAN EFFECTIVELY AND COMPREHENSIVELY REGULATE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THAT IT MAY EFFICACIOUSLY AND APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THE CONTINUALLY EMERGING ISSUES RAISED BY CONTEMPORARY MEDICINE.
937	FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGDS) AND INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS (IIS) WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE COMMON METHODS USED IN EVALUATIONS OF ALL KINDS OF PROJECTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AS RESOURCES ARE OFTEN LIMITED, EVALUATORS MUST CAREFULLY CHOOSE METHODS THAT YIELD THE BEST INFORMATION FOR THEIR PARTICULAR PROGRAM. A CONCERN WITH FGDS AND IIS IS HOW WELL THEY ELICIT INFORMATION ON POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE TOPICS; VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT DIFFERENCES IN DISCLOSURE BY METHODOLOGY IN THE DOMAIN OF JUSTICE. USING FGDS (N = 16) AND IIS (N = 46) FROM A USAID PROJECT IN HAITI, WE SYSTEMATICALLY CODED RESPONSES BASED ON A SHARED ELICITATION GUIDE AROUND ACCESS TO AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND PERFORMED THEMATIC AND STATISTICAL COMPARISONS ACROSS THE TWO METHODS. WE INTRODUCE THE CONTINUOUS THOUGHT AS THE NOVEL STANDARD UNIT FOR STATISTICAL COMPARISON. PARTICIPANTS IN IIS WERE STATISTICALLY MORE LIKELY TO PROVIDE THEMES RELEVANT TO GENDERBASED VIOLENCE. IMPORTANTLY, SENSITIVE THEMES EXTRACTED IN IIS (E.G., RELATED TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE, ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS, AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE) DID NOT EMERGE IN FGDS. GIVEN THESE RESULTS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS TO THE FGD, PRIORITIZING INTERVIEWS OVER FOCUS GROUP MODALITIES MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO GUIDE TARGETED, EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING ON JUSTICE OR OTHER SOCIALLY SENSITIVE TOPICS.
938	WHY DO SOME PEOPLE EVALUATE STATE SUPREME COURTS AS MORE LEGITIMATE THAN OTHERS? CONVENTIONAL ACADEMIC WISDOM SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE EVALUATE COURTS IN NONPARTISAN WAYS, AND THAT PEOPLE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THEY EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL COURT DECISIONS AND HOW THEY EVALUATE THE COURT'S LEGITIMACY MORE BROADLY. WE CHALLENGE THIS IDEA BY ARGUING THAT PEOPLE'S PARTISAN IDENTITIES HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON HOW PEOPLE EVALUATE THE IMPARTIALITY OF COURTS, JUST AS THEY DO OTHER ASPECTS OF THE POLITICAL WORLD. USING ORIGINAL SURVEY EXPERIMENTS, VALIDATED BY EXISTING OBSERVATIONAL SURVEY DATA, WE SHOW THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE STATE SUPREME COURTS AS BEING MORE IMPARTIAL WHEN COURTS ISSUE DECISIONS THAT MATCH THE IDEOLOGICAL PREFERENCES OF THEIR PREFERRED POLITICAL PARTY, WHILE COURT DECISIONS AT ODDS WITH THEIR PARTY'S POLICY GOALS DIMINISH PEOPLE'S BELIEF THAT COURTS ARE IMPARTIAL ARBITERS OF THE LAW. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS OF CITIZEN PERCEPTIONS OF IMPARTIALITY ERODE EVALUATIONS OF STATE COURT LEGITIMACY, WHICH MAKES THEM WANT TO LIMIT THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS.
939	ALTHOUGH A WINNER-LOSER GAP IN POLITICAL SUPPORT IS PRESENT IN MOST DEMOCRACIES, IN SOME COUNTRIES LOSERS ARE MORE CONTENT THAN IN OTHERS. EARLIER RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS MAY AFFECT THE SIZE OF THE GAP. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ARGUE THAT THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN TYPE OF INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE SIZE OF THE WINNER-LOSER GAP. A WELL-FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY ON THE INPUT-SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND HIGH QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT ON THE OUTPUT-SIDE SIGNIFICANTLY NARROWS THE GAP IN SUPPORT BETWEEN ELECTORAL WINNERS AND LOSERS IN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACIES.
940	PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND STATE IN POST-SOCIALIST RUSSIA ARE ANALYZED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SOCIALIST PERSPECTIVE. THE ARTICLE DEVELOPS IDEAS OF ACADEMICAN V.S. NERSESYANTS THAT SOCIALISM HAS CREATED PRECONDITIONS FOR TRANSITION TO A DIFFERENT SOCIAL ORDER, PROVIDING A NEW STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL PRINCIPLE OF FORMAL EQUALITY. THIS POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT USED IN POST-SOCIALIST RUSSIA. NON-LEGAL NATURE OF PRIVATIZATION OF OUR COMMON SOCIALIST LEGACY HAS GENERATED A FUSION OF NEO-FEUDAL POWER AND PROPERTY, NOT ONLY BLOCKING MOVEMENT FOR A JUST LAW AND LEGAL STATE, BUT AMOUNTING TO RETURN TO CAPITALISM. IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, PROSPECTS OF ADVANCEMENT OF RUSSIA IN THE LEGAL DIRECTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY, ENSURING REAL POLITICAL COMPETITION AND THE LEGITIMIZATION OF PROPERTY BY THE SOCIAL CONTRACT BETWEEN MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF PRIVATIZATION AND THE REST OF SOCIETY.
941	RECENT SCHOLARSHIP HAS INSISTED ON A MORE HISTORICALLY ATTENTIVE APPROACH TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. THIS ARTICLE FOLLOWS THEIR LEAD BY ARGUING THAT THE DOMINANT UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE RELIES ON A CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION AND A HISTORICAL MISTAKE. CONCEPTUALLY, THE LITERATURE FAILS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN VIOLATING A LAW AND DEFYING THE AUTHORITY OF A LEGAL ORDER. HISTORICALLY, THE LITERATURE MISREADS THE EXEMPLARY CASE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA. WHEN READ IN ITS PROPER CONTEXT, WE CAN SEE KING WAS NOT JUST A CIVIL DISOBEDIENT, VIOLATING THE LAW IN A WAY THAT SHOWS FIDELITY TO THE LAW. HE WAS A RADICAL DISOBEDIENT, CHALLENGING THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEGAL ORDER. AS SUCH, HE WAS PART OF A LONG TRADITION OF RADICAL DISOBEDIENCE, EXTENDING BACK THROUGH MILITANT STRIKES OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT. THE CHARACTER OF THIS DISOBEDIENCE WAS EVIDENT, BOTH TO ITS MAIN PROTAGONISTS, LIKE KING AND EUGENE V. DEBS, AND TO ITS MAJOR OPPONENTS, ESPECIALLY THE COURTS. IN RECONSTRUCTING THESE HISTORICAL CASES, I REVISE THE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE LITERATURE AND DEMONSTRATE THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THE RADICAL DISOBEDIENCE CONCEPT.
942	SCHOLARLY WORKS ON JUDICIAL POPULISM TEND TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LANDMARK JUDGMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND APEX COURTS. NONETHELESS, THE EXAMINATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF ORDINARY COURTS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS THEY SHAPE THE LIVES OF CITIZENS AND CAN STRENGTHEN OR CURB POPULIST POLITICS. IN THIS PAPER I ANALYZE A PHENOMENON EMERGING IN THE ADJUDICATION OF HUNGARIAN ORDINARY COURTS WHICH CAN BE LABELLED `EVERYDAY JUDICIAL POPULISM'. BASED ON CASE STUDIES AND EMPIRICAL SCRUTINY I ARGUE THAT THE POLITICAL POPULISM OF THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BOTH A DIRECT AND AN INDIRECT, BUT CLEARLY DETECTABLE, IMPACT ON JUDICIAL PRACTICE. AS REGARDS THE LATTER, THE GOVERNMENT CAN MANIPULATE (THROUGH ITS MEDIA) PUBLIC OPINION IN CERTAIN COURT CASES, AND JUDGES TAKE THIS OPINION - AS THE `VOX POPULI' - INTO CONSIDERATION IN THEIR DECISION-MAKING. AT THE END OF THE PAPER I EXAMINE THE INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE FACILITATED THE EMERGENCE OF JUDICIAL POPULISM.
943	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS FOR A CONCEPT OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION USEFUL FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW. FIRSTLY THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS USED IN THE LITERATURE TO ANALYZE THE CONCEPT ARE CLASSIFIED. A PRINCIPAL-AGENT MODEL IS CHOSEN AS THE BEST OPTION. ONE MAIN PROBLEM IN THIS MODEL IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CONCRETE RULES GOVERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGENT AND PRINCIPAL AND THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM WHICH DETERMINES, PARTIALLY, THE PRESENCE OF A POLITICALLY CORRUPT ACTION. THOSE RULES ARE DEFINED FROM THE CLASSICAL CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF TRUST AS A FAR MORE COMPLEX NOTION THAN THAT OF POLITICAL CONFIDENCE. THIS CONCEPT PRESUPPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF SOME ETHICAL RULES FOR POLITICIANS IN CHARGE OF PUBLIC OFFICES, THE PRESENCE OF A QUALIFIED DUTY TO UPHOLD LAW AND A PERMANENT PROCESS OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CLASSIC NOTION IS THEN ANALYSED FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY PERSPECTIVE IN THE RICH EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM SINCE THE LAST DECADE OF THE XXTH CENTURY. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE NOLAN REPORT, THE NEW CODES OF CONDUCT AND THE REFORMULATION OF THE MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY DOCTRINE. SUCH A CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY CANNOT BE EXTRAPOLATED TO SPAIN SO THE ARTICLE FINISHES WITH SOME GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONDUCT RULES THAT, IN LAST INSTANCE, WILL ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION.
944	ACCION DE CUMPLIMIENTO LOOKS FOR FORCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHO REFUSE TO OBEY THE LAWS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS TO DO IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THE PARTICULARS ATTRIBUTIONS OF PUBLIC POWER. THE ARTICLE 87 OF THE CONSTITUTION REGULATES THIS CONCEPT, AND THE LAW 393 OF 1997 DEVELOPS IT. IN THE PARAGRAPH OF ITS ARTICLE 9; IT ESTABLISHES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF APPLICATION OF THE SAID ACTION WHEN IT COMES ABOUT NORMS THAT ESTABLISH EXPENSES. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CONSIDERED IN ACCORDANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION SUCH RESTRICTION AND THE STATE COUNCIL****, IN SOME OF ITS DECISIONS, HAS SUPPORTED THAT, BECAUSE IT LIMITS A CONSTITUTIONAL NORM, THIS IS ADMISSIBLE ONLY IF IT COMES ABOUT NORMS THAT ORDER THE INCLUSION OF NEW EXPENSES IN THE BUDGET, BECAUSE BEING APPROPRIATED AND WITH AVAILABILITY CERTIFICATES AND BUDGETARY REGISTER, THE ENTITY DOESN'T HAVE DISCRETIONARY TO DECIDE THE EXPENSE. BECAUSE SUCH A DEBATE, AND GIVEN THE CONSENSUS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY IN BUDGETARY SUBJECT, IT IS NECESSARY A DETAILED ANALYSIS AIMING TO DELIMIT ITS NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK, ESPECIALLY IN PUBLIC EXPENSIVE SUBJECT.
945	A BODY OF JURISPRUDENCE IS EMERGING IN AFRICA'S MOST ACTIVE REGIONAL COURTS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF NATIONAL JUDICIARIES. THIS ARTICLE REVEALS THAT WHILE REGIONAL CASE LAW RELEVANTLY ECHOES EFFORTS BY MUNICIPAL COURTS TO SAFEGUARD THEMSELVES, CIRCUMSTANCES DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH CASE LAW REQUIRES GREATER CONTEXTUALIZATION ACROSS SYSTEMS. IN THIS REGARD, THE TRADITIONAL PARADIGM OF LINKING INDEPENDENCE TO EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS DOES NOT EMPIRICALLY STAND THE TEST OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF INDEPENDENCE FACTORS, EXECUTIVE-FREE REGIMES HAVE NOT PROVED EFFECTIVE IN SAFEGUARDING INDEPENDENCE, AND LEGAL TRADITIONS OR JUDICIAL SYSTEMS HAVE INCREASINGLY BECOME IRRELEVANT TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY INDEPENDENCE REGIME. FACTORS THAT TRANSCEND THE TRADITIONAL DETERMINANTS OF EXECUTIVE CONTROL INCLUDE THE NATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE COURT INVOLVED, AND THE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF THE JUDICIAL STRUCTURE OF THE COUNTRY OR REGION. NOTABLY, THE DISCUSSION ALSO REVEALS THE NEED TO STRIKE A CRITICAL BALANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND INTER-STATE DIRECTIVE POLICY TOWARDS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS SET OUT IN THE AFRICAN CHARTER.
946	MICHAEL MANDELBAUM'S DEMOCRACY'S GOOD NAME: THE RISE AND RISKS OF THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT (2007) PROVIDES A VALUABLE ANALYSIS OF THE SUCCESS OF DEMOCRACY IN THE MODERN WORLD BUT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH REMAINING QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH: (I) THE DEFINITION OF DEMOCRACY; (II) THE LINKAGE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND (III) THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. POLITICAL ELASTICITY (PE) THEORY IS USED TO EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, PARTICULARLY THE LINKAGE BETWEEN EFFECTIVE DECENTRALIZATION AND CENTRALIZATION. TO ILLUSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF PE THEORY, SEVERAL COMPARATIVE CASE STUDIES (CHINA AND INDIA; BANGLADESH AND VIETNAM) ARE INTRODUCED IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION OF WHY IS IT THAT AUTHORITARIAN STATES (FOR EXAMPLE, CHINA AND VIETNAM) ARE SOMETIMES MORE SUCCESSFUL IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN RAISING STANDARDS OF LIVING, THAN THEIR MORE DEMOCRATIC COUNTERPARTS. FINALLY, AT THE CONCLUSION, THE QUESTION IS RAISED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF DEMOCRACY TO CORRUPTION. IN SO DOING, LORD ACTON'S PROVOCATIVE ASSERTION, 'POWER TENDS TO CORRUPT AND ABSOLUTE POWER, TO CORRUPT ABSOLUTELY', IS ADDRESSED, INCLUDING A COMPARISON OF AUTHORITARIAN SINGAPORE AND DEMOCRATIC JAMAICA, SUGGESTING: (I) THAT POLITICAL POWER, IF PERSUASIVE, IS NOT NECESSARILY CORRUPTIVE; (II) LIBERAL OR PARTISAN DEMOCRACY TENDS TO CORRUPT AND LAWLESS DEMOCRACY, TO CORRUPT ABSOLUTELY AND (III) AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES MAY RECOGNIZE THAT CONTROLLING CORRUPTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR LEGITIMACY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.
947	CARL SCHMITT, WHATEVER HIS CLEAR DEFICIENCIES AS A HUMAN BEING AND EXCESSES IN HIS OVERALL THOUGHT, IS, BY ANY OBJECTIVE MEASURE, ONE OF THE LEADING JURISPRUDENTIAL FIGURES OF THE 20TH CENTURY. AND THE QUESTIONS HE RAISED - ABOUT THE INEVITABLY OF DISCRETIONARY DECISION-MAKING IN THE AGE OF THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE; THE BREAKDOWN OF LIBERAL PARLIAMENTARISM; OR THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT 'EMERGENCIES' MUST PLAY IN ANY COGENT JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORY, TO NAME ONLY THREE - CONTINUE TO RESONATE VERY MUCH INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. WILLIAM SCHEUERMAN IS AT BEST AMBIVALENT, IF NOT HOSTILE, TO MANY ASPECTS OF SCHMITT AND SCHMITTIAN THEORY, BUT HE PRESENTS SCHMITT'S IDEAS WITH REMARKABLE CLARITY THAT ENABLES THE READER TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT TO READ AND TO WRESTLE WITH HIM.
948	FRANCIS FUKUYAMA WROTE REFLECTIONS OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE TECHNICALLY FOR CHINESE READERS TO UNDERSTAND HIS IDEAS IN AN ACCURATE WAY. I THINK IT IS NOT TRUE TO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF RULE OF LAW DEPENDS ON RELIGION ACCORDING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THE HISTORY OF LAW. MEANWHILE, THE HYPOTHESIS STILL NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED THAT THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ONLY APPEARS THROUGH THE VOTE, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT BY VOTE ONLY LEADS TO STABILITY IN SOME DEGREE BUT INEFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN ALMOST ALL OF THE UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. A GOVERNMENT WITHOUT GOVERNANCE CANNOT BE CALLED ACCOUNTABLE; IT EVEN HAS NO MORALITY IF WE CONSIDER HUNTINGTON'S IDEA. IT SEEMS THAT FUKUYAMA'S THREE INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS SHOULD BE SEEN AS A REVISITED VERSION OF THE END OF HISTORY. FOR INSTANCE, IT IS NOT OBJECTIONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT CHINA LACKS THE FACTS OF RULE OF LAW SINCE IT HAS NO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE SINCE THESE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT EVEN PERFORM WORSE THAN CHINA. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE SHOULD NOT SIMPLY JUDGE THE FACTS OF RULE OF LAW BY THIS SINGLE STANDARD. MEANWHILE, CHINA IS ALWAYS CRITICIZED THAT IT LACKS ACCOUNTABILITY; HOWEVER, THE RESPONSIVENESS OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO PEOPLE'S APPEALS MIGHT BE THE MOST PROMPT AND COMPREHENSIVE IN ALL OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FUKUYAMA'S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CHINA REMAINS LOCKED INTO THE OLD IMPRESSION OF CHINA AS VIEWED BY THE WESTERN WORLD. IN FACT, THE ACCURATE WAY OF UNDERSTANDING CHINA SHOULD BE 'FINDING HISTORY IN CHINA'. I AGREE THAT WHATEVER REGIME IT IS, IT NEEDS TO BE REFORMED AND CHANGED WITH TIME. AS FOR CHINESE GOVERNMENT, THE REFORM DOES NOT HAPPEN IN A SINGLE FIELD OF THE RULE OF LAW AS FUKUYAMA MENTIONED, BUT IN THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A LIMITED GOVERNMENT WITH CAPACITY AS A GOAL IN THE FUTURE.
949	THE PROJECT OF GOVERNANCE, WHICH HAS BEEN HERALDED AS A CONTEMPORARY ADVANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, HAS A VERY OLD LINEAGE. SINCE THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MODERN DISCIPLINE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS DEVISED A NUMBER OF DOCTRINES DIRECTED AT SHAPING AND REFORMING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NON-EUROPEAN STATE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE EXERTS AN EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON THE THINKING OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN PART BECAUSE IT IS CONNECTED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS, THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE IN THIS "AGE OF RIGHTS". THE LINK SUGGESTS THAT THE THIRD WORLD STATE IS THE FOCUS OF CONCERN: IT IS THE ABERRANT THIRD WORLD STATE WHICH BOTH VIOLATES RIGHTS AND ENGAGES IN BAD GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER CRITIQUES THE STANCE THAT THE PROBLEM OF ADDRESSING INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE CAN BE LARGELY ACHIEVED THROUGH THE PROJECT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE WHICH WOULD REFORM THE THIRD WORLD STATE. IT SEEKS TO ARGUE THAT DEMOCRATIC EXPERIMENTALISM, NOT THE SO-CALLED "MCDONALDIZATION" (GLOBALIZATION AS HOMOGENIZATION) OF THE WORLD, IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT "MCDONALDIZATION" MINIMIZES THE COMPLEX WAY IN WHICH THE LOCAL INTERACTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL.
950	IMPUNITY IS INCREASINGLY BEING RECOGNIZED AS A PHENOMENON THAT IS AT ONCE OFTEN BOTH THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF SOME OF THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN LATIN AMERICA AS WELL AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME OF THE CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES INVOLVED IN MEASURING THE PHENOMENON OF IMPUNITY, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON LATIN AMERICA. THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES THE CORRELATION BETWEEN IMPUNITY AND OTHER PROBLEMS GOVERNMENTS FACE, SUCH AS INSECURITY, VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION AND INEQUALITY. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE THE METHODOLOGY OF THE 2015 GLOBAL IMPUNITY INDEX THAT IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR ANALYZING THESE PHENOMENA.
951	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SET OF THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL REFLECTIONS THAT ARISE FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DOCTORAL THESIS WORK WHOSE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF LEADERSHIP OF TEACHING MANAGERS IN THE PROCESSES OF THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (QMS) FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT AND ASSURANCE OF THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE OFFERED BY THE LUIGI PIRANDELLO SCHOOL (BOGOTA DC) AND THE CAMPESTRE REINO BRITANICO GYMNASIUM (TENJO) LOCATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CUNDINAMARCA, COLOMBIA. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS IN RELATION TO THE PERCEPTION OF THE TEACHING STAFF REGARDING THE QMS PROCESSES, IN ADDITION TO THE FINDINGS OF THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF THE RESEARCH, ENABLED A CRITICAL REFLECTION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ACHIEVING AND ENSURING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW, WHERE THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE.
952	IN THE ARTICLE THERE IS THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW IN RUSSIA, UKRAINE, KAZAKHSTAN AND TURKMENISTAN, REFLECTING THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PRODUCTION OF JUVENILE. SAMPLING STATES WHOSE LEGISLATION IS COMPARED WITH THE RUSSIAN, INFORMED DECISION IN THEIR NEW CODES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN 2012-2014. RULE OF LAW IN THE PRODUCTION OF JUVENILE IN EACH OF THEM, AS IN RUSSIA, BASED ON THE RULES OF ATTRIBUTION OF INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION IN CASES OF CRIMES OF MINORS TO SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE LAW OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE PROMISING POSITION, WHICH CAN BE CLAIMED IN THE RUSSIAN CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
953	CURRENTLY LEGAL HERMENEUTICS PRESENTS SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, SINCE, IN VIEW OF INDETERMINATE LEGAL CONCEPTS, THE JUDGE IS REQUIRED TO PLAY A HIGHLY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE ON THE SEMANTIC CONTENT OF THE STATEMENTS UNDER ANALYSIS, A SITUATION CONDUCIVE TO THE EMERGENCE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM. THE PRESENT ARTICLE ANALYSES WHAT IS JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND ITS POSSIBLE VALIDITY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE RULE OF LAW. WITH THIS IN MIND, WE INVESTIGATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEM AND BETWEEN LEGAL SYSTEM AND LEGAL HIERARCHY; A NUMBER OF POSTMODERN LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE EMERGENCE OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM; THE DEFINITION OF JUDICIALISATION AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, FREE CONVINCING OF THE JUDGE AND PRO-JUDICIAL ACTIVITY, AND THE RISK TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN THE FACE OF A POSSIBLE DICTATORSHIP OF THE JUDICIARY BRANCH. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE RESULTS SOUGHT BY OUR RESEARCH, THE METHOD OF APPROACH WE USED IS THE EMPIRICO-DIALECTIC, BASED ON THE USE OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND LEGISLATIVE SOURCES. AS BACKGROUND, WE USE A REFERENCE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LINGUISTIC TURN, INSPIRED BY THE LOGICAL-SEMANTIC CONSTRUCTIVISM OF PAULO DE BARROS CARVALHO. IN CONCLUSION, BASED ON THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK ADOPTED, WE POINT OUT THAT JUDICIAL ACTIVISM HAS NO VALIDITY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
954	THIS STUDY COMPLEMENTS THE EXTANT LITERATURE BY ASSESSING HOW THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY MODULATE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT DYNAMICS (I.E. TOURISM RECEIPTS AND TOURISM EXPENDITURE) TO AFFECT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN TERMS OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) PER CAPITA. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON 47 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA) WITH DATA FOR THE PERIOD 2002-2018 AND THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS. THE STUDY FINDS THAT: (I) THE RULE OF LAW MODULATES BOTH TOURISM RECEIPTS AND TOURISM EXPENDITURE FOR OVERALL POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND (II) POLITICAL STABILITY MODULATES TOURISM RECEIPTS FOR AN OVERALL POSITIVE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
955	WE EXAMINE THE DIRECT EFFECT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) ON INEQUALITY AND INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE ICT AND INEQUALITY RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE REINFORCED BY GOVERNANCE INDICATORS OF DEMOCRACY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY. USING THE PANEL DATASET OF 46 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1984-2018 AND DYNAMIC TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT ESTIMATOR, WE FOUND THAT ICT MEASURES OF INTERNET, FIXED BROADBAND AND MOBILE CELLULAR SUBSCRIPTION DIRECTLY REDUCE INEQUALITY, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS CAN REINFORCE THE ICT AND INEQUALITY LINKS. WE EXECUTE A THRESHOLD ANALYSIS THAT IL-LUSTRATES THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF DEMOCRACY, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL STABILITY IN FACILITATING THE ICT AND INEQUALITY RELATIONSHIPS IN AFRICA.
956	THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS PAPER IS WHAT KIND OF REFORMS ARE NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THAT LATIN AMERICAN POLICE FORCES MEET WHAT BAYLEY CALLS 'THE DEMOCRATIC CRITERIA': 1) POLICE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO LAW, NOT TO GOVERNMENT; 2) POLICE PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION; 3) THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS ON THE USE OF POLICE FORCE THAT ARE ENFORCED BY INSTITUTIONS EXTERNAL TO THE POLICE FORCE; 4) THE POLICE FORCE'S PRIORITY IS THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS AS INDIVIDUALS AND PRIVATE GROUPS, NOT THE STATE. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS THE TYPES OF REFORMS THAT ENSURE THAT A POLICE FORCE IS ABIDING BY THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER A DEMOCRATIC REGIME. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME CASES THE TWO PROBLEMS ARE SO ENTANGLED THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS POLICE REFORM WITHOUT ADDRESSING EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE CRIME. HOWEVER, AS WE ARGUE IN THE PAPER, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. IN MANY COUNTRIES IT SEEMS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE TWO.
957	INEQUALITY AND GENDER ECONOMIC EXCLUSION ARE MAJOR POLICY CONCERNS FACING SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IN THE POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES 'THRESHOLDS' OF INEQUALITY THAT SHOULD NOT BE EXCEEDED IF GOVERNANCE IS TO PROMOTE GENDER ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION. THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON 42 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA USING ANNUAL DATA FROM 2004 TO 2014. THE EMPIRICAL WORK UTILISES THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS. THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED. FIRST, INEQUALITY (I.E. THE GINI COEFFICIENT) LEVELS THAT COMPLETELY NULLIFY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON FEMALE LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION ARE 0.708 FOR POLITICAL STABILITY, 0.601 FOR VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY, 0.588 FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, 0.631 FOR REGULATORY QUALITY, 0.612 FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND 0.550 FOR CORRUPTION-CONTROL. SECOND, INEQUALITY THRESHOLDS AT WHICH FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT CAN NO LONGER BE MITIGATED BY GOVERNANCE CHANNELS INCLUDE: 0.561 FOR POLITICAL STABILITY AND 0.465 FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIRD, INEQUALITY LEVELS THAT COMPLETELY DAMPEN THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE ON FEMALE EMPLOYMENT ARE 0.608 FOR POLITICAL STABILITY, 0.580 FOR VOICE & ACCOUNTABILITY, 0.581 FOR GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND 0.557 FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AS THE MAIN POLICY IMPLICATION, FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE TO PROMOTE GENDER ECONOMIC INCLUSION, INEQUALITY LEVELS SHOULD NOT EXCEED SUCH THRESHOLDS.
958	CARL SCHMITT'S CRITIQUE OF LIBERALISM INCLUDES A SPECIFIC ATTACK ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL COHERENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A COMPONENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, A VIEW HE IDENTIFIES WITH THE WIDER LIBERAL TRADITION. DESPITE HIS ASSOCIATIONS WITH NAZISM IT HAS BEEN TAKEN UP RECENTLY BY POST-MODEM CRITICS OF LIBERALISM. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES SCHMITT'S CLAIMS AND THEN COMPARES THEM WITH WHAT REPRESENTATIVE LIBERALS ACTUALLY SAY ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. THE FINDING IS THAT AT LEAST TWO MAJOR THINKERS - LOCKE AND BURKE - SHOW NONE OF THE IGNORANCE OR NAIVETE WITH WHICH SCHMITT CHARGES THE TRADITION. CONCEPTS SUCH AS THE EXCEPTION ARE RECOGNIZED AND INCLUDED IN THEIR POLITICAL ANALYSES - BUT, UNLIKE SCHMITT, NOT IN THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS.
959	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE DEPENDENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ON AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND A LEGAL PROFESSION, THE RULE OF LAW BEING LESS VULNERABLE WHERE AN INDEPENDENT BAR EXISTS. THE COMMON LAW TRIAL IS THE ULTIMATE VINDICATION OF JUSTICE AND IT RELIES ON AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE BENCH AND THE BAR. THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE INTERPLAY AND THE RECIPROCAL DUTIES AND RIGHTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT. DUTIES INVOLVING THE KEEPING OF AN ACCURATE TRIAL RECORD, ENSURING THAT PROCEEDINGS DISPLAY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REGULARITY, GUARDING AGAINST THE DANGERS OF PUBLICITY, IDENTIFYING THE RELEVANT ISSUES OF LAW AND FACT, THE TENDERING OF EVIDENCE, THE CONTROLLING OF THE EVIDENCE, FORMULATING JURY DIRECTIONS AND FINAL ADDRESSES AMONG OTHERS, ARE EXAMINED.
960	WE PROVIDE LARGE-SCALE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AND HEALTH POLICIES, VACCINATION, POPULATION MOBILITY, AND COVID-19-RELATED TWITTER NARRATIVES ON THE SPREAD OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION. USING MULTIPLE-LEVEL FIXED EFFECTS PANEL DATA MODEL WITH WEEKLY DATA FOR 27 EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD OF MARCH 2020-JUNE 2021, WE SHOW THAT GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSE POLICIES WERE EFFECTIVE BOTH IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 INFECTION CASES AND DEATHS FROM IT, PARTICULARLY, IN THE COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW. VACCINATION EXPECTEDLY HELPED TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF VIRUS CASES. REDUCTIONS IN POPULATION MOBILITY IN PUBLIC PLACES AND WORKPLACES WERE ALSO POWERFUL IN FIGHTING THE PANDEMIC. NEXT, WE IDENTIFY FOUR CORE PANDEMIC-RELATED TWITTER NARRATIVES: GOVERNMENTAL RESPONSE POLICIES, PEOPLE'S SAD FEELINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC, VACCINATION, AND PANDEMIC-RELATED INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. WE FIND THAT SAD FEELINGS' NARRATIVE HELPED TO COMBAT THE VIRUS SPREAD IN EU COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS ALSO REVEAL THAT WHILE IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH RULE OF LAW INTERNATIONAL POLITICS' NARRATIVE HELPED TO REDUCE THE VIRUS SPREAD, IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW RULE OF LAW THE EFFECT WAS STRICTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE LATTER FINDING SUGGESTS THAT TRUST IN POLITICIANS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONFRONTING THE PANDEMIC.
961	IF AN ARBITRATION SYSTEM, HYPOTHETICALLY DISCONNECTED FROM STATES, WERE TO SEEK TO REPLICATE THE RULE OF LAW BEYOND THE STATE, IN ITS OWN TRANSNATIONAL ORDER, WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? THIS QUESTION, WHICH SEEMS CURRENT GIVEN THE PROLIFERATION OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND THE CONTINUING RISE OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, FORMED AN IMPLICIT THEME OF THE SCHOLARSHIP KNOWN AS THE SCHOOL OF DIJON. SOME 30 YEARS AGO, THE SCHOOL OF DIJON ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF NON-NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS REVOLVING AROUND ARBITRATION MECHANISMS, SUCH AS THE LEX MERCATORIA. OVER THE YEARS, THEIR CLAIM DEVELOPED INTO THE ARGUMENT THAT THESE SYSTEMS' OWN LEGALITY FORMS A BASIS FOR CLAIMS OF AUTONOMY FROM THE STATE, THE PRESENCE OF LAW DISPENSING FROM THE NEED FOR CONTROL BY ANOTHER LEGAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, FIRST, THAT THIS LINE OF ARGUMENTS IS AN ENTHYMEME, AS THE CONCEPT OF LAW HAS BEEN THE OBJECT OF A NEAR WHOLESALE ESCHEWAL OF DEFINITIONAL ATTENTION BY THE SCHOOL OF DIJON AND ITS KINDRED THEORIES. THE ARTICLE THEN MAINTAINS THAT ANY CONCEPT OF LAW USED FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED RHETORICAL AND POLITICAL PURPOSES OUGHT TO INCLUDE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT THEN EXAMINES THE GUISE THAT THE RULE OF LAW TAKES WHEN APPLIED TO TRANSNATIONAL ADJUDICATIVE NORMATIVE ORDERS INSTEAD OF NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS.
962	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING, WHICH ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH RULE OF LAW INITIATIVES AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. JUDICIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS ADDRESS EVERYTHING FROM LEADERSHIP COMPETENCIES AND SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW OF HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION TO CLIENT SERVICE AND COMMUNICATION, SKILLS TRAINING ON DOCKET MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, JUDICIAL EDUCATION IN SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME BIG BUSINESS BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE WORLD BANK ALONE SPENDS APPROXIMATELY U.S. $24 MILLION PER YEAR FOR FUNDED PROJECTS PRIMARILY ATTENDING TO IMPROVING COURT PERFORMANCE. AND YET, THE SPECIFICS OF JUDICIAL EDUCATION REMAINS UNKNOWN IN TERMS OF ITS PLACE IN THE INDUSTRY OF RULE OF LAW INITIATIVES, THE NUMBER OF JUDGES WHO ACT AS EDUCATORS, AND THE MECHANISMS THAT SECURE THEIR PARTICIPATION. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE JUDGES' EXPERIENCES; IN PARTICULAR, THE JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ISRAEL WHO WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF JUDICIAL TRAINING. LAWYERS, DEVELOPMENT PRACTITIONERS, JUSTICE EXPERTS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING JUDGES. LESS WELL KNOWN IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH JUDGES THEMSELVES INTERACT INTERNATIONALLY AS LEARNERS, EDUCATORS, AND DIRECTORS OF TRAINING INSTITUTES. WHILE MUCH SCHOLARLY ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO FINDING A GLOBAL JURISTOCRACY IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, SCHOLARS HAVE, OVERLOOKED THE ROLE THAT JUDGES PLAY IN THE TRANSNATIONAL MOVEMENT OF IDEAS ABOUT COURT STRUCTURE, LEGAL PROCEDURE, CASE MANAGEMENT, AND COURT ADMINISTRATION. SIMILARLY, SCHOLARSHIP EXAMINES THE WAY LEGAL NORMS CIRCULATE, THE SOURCE OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, AND THE WAY "TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL PROCESSES" INCREASE THE ROLE OF COURTS WITHIN NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. THERE IS LITTLE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION, HOWEVER, TO JUDGES AS ACTORS IN THESE TRANSNATIONAL PROCESSES. THIS ARTICLE SITUATES JUDICIAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS AS AN EXAMPLE OF JUDICIAL INVOLVEMENT IN NON-CASE RELATED LAW REFORM. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE INSTRUMENTAL CONNECTION BETWEEN JUDICIAL EDUCATION AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARGUING THAT INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL EDUCATION BECAME A SOLUTION AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE PROBLEM A RULE OF LAW DEFICIT WAS BEING IDENTIFIED. THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES WHETHER INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL EDUCATION CAN STAND AS AN INSTANTIATION OF A GLOBAL JUDICIAL DIALOGUE. JUDGES HAVE IMMERSED THEMSELVES IN FOREIGN RELATIONS. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, LESS STRATEGIC IN PUSHING THEIR IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA THAN LITERATURE ABOUT JUDGES AND POLITICS WOULD SUGGEST. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT JUDGES EXPERIENCE POLITICS AS A SERIES OF PARTIAL CONNECTIONS, WHICH RESEMBLE MOST LEGAL ACTORS' ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PERSONAL AND THE POLITICAL.
963	THIS ESSAY IS MEANT TO DRAW THE PRINCIPLE OUTLINES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIFIC MODERN ISSUE OF PENALTY. DERIVING FROM AN EROSION OF AUGUSTINE'S DOMINATING PARADIGM OF RETRIBUTION AS A BALANCE OF TWO EQUIVALENT "EVILS" THE LEGITIMATION OF MODERN PUNISHMENT WAS NOT SOUGHT IN EFFICIENT DETERRENCE ONLY - AS UTILITARIAN PHILOSOPHERS SUGGESTED. MORE DEEPLY, A MODERN JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF KANT, FICHTE AND HEGEL BY SUCCESSIVELY UNFOLDING ITS CLOSE RELATION TO THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM. THIS DOES NOT ONLY STRESS THE CRIMINAL'S OWN RESPONSIBILITY BUT ALSO RELIES ON THE CONDITION OF A DEVELOPED RULE OF LAW. AS A RESULT PUNISHMENT WAS NOT ONLY MEANT TO RESTORE SOVEREIGNTY, OFTEN BASED ON A SOCIAL CONTRACT, BUT ALSO THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATION OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. ADHERING TO A SUBSTANTIAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MODERN STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW THIS CONCEPT OF PENAL LAW DRAWS A MARKED DISTINCTION BETWEEN "PUNISHMENT" AND "WAR" AND ALSO SETS A CLEAR LIMIT TO TENDENCIES OF EXPANDING CRIMINALITY BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW. REGARDING ITS PHILOSOPHICAL IMPACT IT PREDOMINANTLY MUST BE PUT FORWARD AGAINST ALL MEASURES WHICH NEGATE OR EXTINGUISH THE CRIMINAL'S PERSONALITY AS A WHOLE, SUCH AS TORTURE, DEATH PENALTY OR LIFE IMPRISONMENT.
964	THE ATTENTION OF SCHOLARS AND POLICYMAKERS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE GREEN ECONOMY HAS BEEN ON INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE TOPIC HAS NOT BEEN EXHAUSTIVELY INVESTIGATED. THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE IMPLICATIONS OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS ON SUSTAINABLE GREEN ECONOMY IN TURKEY UTILIZING A TIME SERIES DATA SPANNING FROM 1996 TO 2019. THIS STUDY EMPLOYED PERRON AND LEE-STRAZICICH UNIT ROOT TEST IN THE PRESENCE OF STRUCTURAL BREAK POINT FOR EXAMINING THE STATIONARITY PROPERTIES OF THE SERIES AND FMOLS, CCR, AND ARDL FOR ESTIMATING THE LONG AND SHORT-RUN EFFECT OF THE FINANCIAL REGULATIONS ON CARBON PRODUCTIVITY. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND INFLATION HAVE A SIGNIFICANT LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP WITH CARBON PRODUCTIVITY AS CONFIRMED BY FMOLS AND CCR, WHILE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND INFLATION WERE CONFIRMED BY ARDL TO HAVE LONG-RUN CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CARBON PRODUCTIVITY. IN ADDITION, OUR STUDY FOUND THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND INFLATION HAVE A SHORT-RUN CAUSAL EFFECT ON CARBON PRODUCTIVITY. FINALLY, THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT FINANCIAL REGULATIONS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE GREEN ECONOMY IN TURKEY AND AS SUCH SHOULD BE ACCORDED ADEQUATE ATTENTION BY THE POLICY MAKERS.
965	AFTER MANY WAVES OF DEMOCRATISATION A NEW TYPE OF CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION HAS BECOME THE FOCUS OF SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. SOME RESEARCHERS CLAIM THAT THE CURRENT EROSION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BETTER IF THE PHENOMENON IS COMPARED TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY DICTATORSHIPS. MANY OTHERS ARGUE THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY IS A SELF-DESTRUCTION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY THROUGH DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES AND UNDER THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEW SYSTEM, AND OFFERS ANOTHER APPROACH. IT SHOWS THAT IN A NORMATIVE SENSE DEMOCRACY TODAY IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THAT IS WHY A KEY ATTRIBUTE OF CONTEMPORARY AUTHORITARIANISM, A SUI GENERIS SYSTEM BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND DICTATORSHIP, IS A PRETENCE OF DEMOCRACY. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT MECHANISMS OF PRETENCE CAN BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE HELP OF CONSTITUTIONAL MARKERS, WHICH ALLOW A RELIABLE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND AUTHORITARIANISM. CONSTITUTIONAL MARKERS CAN BE REVEALED ON TWO LEVELS: FIRST, BY A SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AND PRACTICE AND SECOND, BY EXPLORING THE DEEP STRUCTURE OF THE FALSE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SYSTEM.
966	COUNCILS OF THE JUDICIARY HAVE SPREAD IN EUROPE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO A CENTRAL ASPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW: THE INDEPENDENCE OF COURTS AND JUDGES UNDER THEIR AUTHORITY. HOWEVER, A RECENT SURVEY OF THE EUROPEAN NETWORK OF COUNCILS OF THE JUDICIARY SHOWED THAT, IN SOME COUNTRIES, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GROUPS OF JUDGES THAT PERCEIVE THEIR JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS DISRESPECTFUL OF THEIR AUTONOMY. WHILE IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS DENMARK OR BELGIUM JUDICIAL DISTRUST OF THE COUNCIL SEEMS TO BE ANECDOTAL, IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS SPAIN A STRIKING 36 PER CENT OF RESPONDENT JUDGES HAD SUCH NEGATIVE VIEWS OF THE INSTITUTION. WITH THE AID OF MULTI-VALUE QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE CAUSES OF THIS PARADOXICAL PHENOMENON. IT IS ARGUED THAT JUDGES HOLD SUCH NEGATIVE OPINIONS OF COUNCILS OF THE JUDICIARY AS THE RESULT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND SOCIO-LEGAL CONDITIONS: THE RANGE OF POWERS OF THE COUNCILS, THEIR CONTROL BY POLITICAL ELITES AND INTEREST GROUPS, AND THE DEGREE OF JUDICIAL CORRUPTION.
967	THE AUTHORS ARGUE, USING HISTORICAL EXAMPLES FROM FINANCE, THE PRODUCTION OF WINE AND MUSIC, THAT COMPETITION WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT REGULATION, PRODUCES DESIRABLE OUTCOMES.
968	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON MATERIAL FROM GEOFFREY GUNN'S HO CHI MINH IN HONG KONG: ANTI-COLONIAL NETWORKS, EXTRADITION AND THE RULE OF LAW (CAMBRIDGE: CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2021).
969	THE WORLDWIDE POPULIST WAVE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A PERCEPTION THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW IS CURRENTLY IN A STATE OF CRISIS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW FAR POPULIST GOVERNMENTS HAVE CHALLENGED PREVAILING INTERPRETATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE ARTICLE LINKS STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF POPULISM WITH AN ANALYSIS OF POPULIST GOVERNMENTAL STRATEGIES AND ARGUMENTATIVE PRACTICES. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT, IN THEIR RHETORIC, POPULIST GOVERNMENTS PROMOTE AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS A MERE LAW OF COORDINATION. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY REFLECTED IN THEIR LEGAL PRACTICES WHERE AN INSTRUMENTAL, CHERRY-PICKING APPROACH PREVAILS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT POLICIES OF POPULIST GOVERNMENTS AFFECT THE CURRENT STATE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ON TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS: IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE, THEIR PRACTICES ALTER THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH LEGAL RULES ARE INTERPRETED AND, IN THE LEGAL SPHERE, POPULIST GOVERNMENTS PUSH FOR CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ESTABLISHED INTERNATIONAL LEGAL RULES. THE ARTICLE SUBSTANTIATES THESE PROPOSITIONS BY FOCUSING ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERVENTION AND FOREIGN FUNDING FOR NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS.
970	DE MOOR'S BIOGRAPHY ILLUSTRATES HOW PEOPLE AND IDEAS TRAVELLED BETWEEN AND WITHIN NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL SPACES. HE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE CIRCULATION OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE TRANSNATIONAL EPISTEMIC COMMUNITY, MORE PRECISELY BETWEEN THE CAMBRIDGE COMMISSION AND THE LONDON INTERNATIONAL ASSEMBLY. IN THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND THE PLACE OF NATION STATES WITHIN IT, DE MOOR CAME TO EMBRACE THE IDEA THAT STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW HAD TO BE RECALIBRATED AND THAT, AS A LOGICAL CONCLUSION, WAR CRIMES COULD BE PROSECUTED INTERNATIONALLY. IN LONDON, HE BECAME AN ADVOCATE FOR A UNIVERSAL ORGANIZATION BACKED BY AN INTERNATIONAL COURT AND AN INTERNATIONAL ARMED FORCE. HE ENVISIONED AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM GOVERNING THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER.
971	THEORY TELLS US THAT WEAK RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS DETER CROSS-BORDER INTEGRATION, DETER INVESTMENT RELATIVE TO TRADE, AND INHIBIT TRADE FINANCE. DRAWING ON A SURVEY OF MORE THAN 300 CHINESE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE DOING OR HAVE DONE BUSINESS IN NORTH KOREA, WE CONSIDER HOW INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ADDRESSED THESE PROBLEMS IN A SETTING IN WHICH RULE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS ARE PARTICULARLY WEAK. GIVEN THE APPARENT RELIANCE ON HEDGING STRATEGIES, THE RAPID GROWTH IN EXCHANGE WITNESSED IN RECENT YEARS MAY PROVE SELF-LIMITING, AS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ERODE AND THE RISK PREMIUM RISES. INSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT WELFARE IMPLICATIONS, AFFECTING THE VOLUME, COMPOSITION, AND FINANCIAL TERMS OF CROSS-BORDER EXCHANGE. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
972	EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP AND HUMAN RIGHTS INVOLVES, AMONG OTHER AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SUBJECT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP, LOYALTY TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A PARTICIPATORY POLITICAL CULTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP CAN BE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THREE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OR MODELS OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP THAT INVOLVE DIFFERENT DEMOCRATIC EXERCISES. LOYALTY TO THE RULE OF LAW INVOLVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POLITICAL IDENTITY, AND NOT ONLY A PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL AND ETHNIC IDENTITY, AND SO ON, BUT ALSO, FINALLY, EDUCATION OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PARTICIPATORY POLITICAL CULTURE. THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO ELUCIDATE THE ABOVE CONCEPTS AND TO ANALYSE HOW THEY ARE TREATED IN SPECIFIC TEXTBOOKS ON EDUCATION FOR CITIZENSHIP AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
973	RECENT COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEMS, OR POLICE STATES, HAVE PAID SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE POLICE. YET ISSUES OF POLICING AND POLICE REFORM ARE VITAL TO DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. FIVE RECENT BOOKS HIGHLIGHT KEY ISSUES OF POLICING, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW. FROM A STRATEGIC CHOICE PERSPECTIVE THE POLICE ARE A CRUCIAL (THOUGH SOMETIMES UNRELIABLE) BARGAINING TOOL IN THE NEGOTIATING GAME OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. AN ORGANIZATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HIGHLIGHTS DEBATES OVER POLICE-MILITARY RELATIONS, REFORM OF POLICE NORMS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONS FOR OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE THE POLICE MIRROR ENDURING SOCIAL TENSIONS THROUGH DEBATES OVER PAST POLICE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND SUPPRESSION OF POOR AND MARGINALIZED CITIZENS.
974	THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ETHICS AND THE DIRECT INFLUENCE OF POLITICS ON HOW ETHICS BODIES FRAME THEIR OPINIONS HAVE BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED AND EXPLORED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO WHAT KIND OF NORMATIVE INSTRUMENT "ETHICS" AS AN INSTITUTIONAL PHENOMENON HAS BECOME IN THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AND WHICH INSTITUTIONAL POWERS IT HAS DEPENDED ON. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE RISE OF ETHICS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTEXT, WHERE ETHICS, CONSTRUCTED AS AN ISOLATED SET OF VALUES, HAS BEEN EXPLOITED FOR ITS SYMBOLIC CAPACITY TO EVOKE CITIZENSHIP, HAS BECOME QUITE FORMALIZED AS TO CERTAIN FEATURES, AND HAS ACQUIRED THE POTENTIAL TO REDEFINE THE TRADITIONAL DIVISIONS OF POWERS IN THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
975	MANY PHILOSOPHERS, PAST AND PRESENT, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ERADICATE THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY. THE MOST INTERESTING AND MOST AMBITIOUS ATTEMPT TO DO SO, COMES FROM THOSE PHILOSOPHERS WHO CLAIM THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS IN PRINCIPLE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REPEL THIS LATTER ATTACK. IN ORDER TO DO SO, I INVESTIGATE THE ANALOGY BETWEEN SOVEREIGNTY AND INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY. THE RESULTING CONCEPTION OF SOVEREIGNTY, 'SOVEREIGNTY AS AUTONOMY', SHOWS THAT SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE UTTERLY COMPATIBLE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS CONCEPTION CONSERVES WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE NORMATIVE CORE OF OUR MODERN NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY: WHEN SPEAKING OF SOVEREIGNTY, WE INVOKE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM WHICH A POLITICAL COMMUNITY CAN CONSCIOUSLY UNDERSTAND ITSELF AS AN AUTONOMOUS AGENT.
976	SUBSEQUENT TO PRECEDENTS LIKE SOLANGE AND KADI, JUDGMENT NO. 238 HANDED DOWN BY THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, REPRESENTS NOVEL JURISPRUDENCE THAT RAISES FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISTINCT LEGAL ORDERS. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION AIMS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE JUDGMENT REPRESENTS AN INSTANCE OF SO-CALLED 'CONSTRUCTIVE CONTESTATION' BY DOMESTIC COURTS AGAINST INTERNATIONAL LAW NOT ADHERING TO FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IT ARGUES THAT, EVEN THOUGH IN THE SHORT TERM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SEEMINGLY FAVOURS HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THEREFORE, ALSO FOSTERS A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW, STRONG REASONS CAN BE BROUGHT FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF THE OPPOSING INTERPRETATION. IN THE LONG RUN, THIS JUDGMENT MAY HAMPER THE SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION AND THE (INTERNATIONAL) RULE OF LAW.
977	RUSSIA UNDER YELTSIN HAS BEEN REPLETE WITH FAILURE. UNTIL THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE INTRODUCED, RUSSIA WILL REMAIN A LAND OF ANARCHY AND UNPLEASANT SURPRISES.
978	THIS ARTICLE ENQUIRES INTO THE ARGUMENTS HELD BY THE CONSTITUENT MEMBERS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE. FOR THAT, MPS TURNS OCCURRED BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER 1931 ARE ANALYSED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE TWO RIVAL VIEWS ON THE STATE WITHIN THE CONSTITUENT CORTES OF THE SPANISH SECOND REPUBLIC ARE TO A GREAT EXTENT THOSE ALTERNATIVES HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE OPPOSITION. BOTH PORTRAY THE IDEOLOGICAL DISPUTES ABOUT, ON THE ONE HAND, A MODEL OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, DEFENDED BY THE FIRST COALITION GOVERNMENT; AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, A PROPOSAL OPPOSED TO BROADENING SOCIAL RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT, WHEREAS IN FAVOUR OF STRENGTHENING BASIC INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN THE CONSECUTION OF THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW TO REFORM THE CONSTITUTION OF 1876.
979	THIS ESSAY COMMENTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW BY DRAWING ON STANLEY HOFFMANN'S 1961 LANDMARK ARTICLE 'INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW'. I START WITH TWO GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW: HENKIN'S LAW AND DEMOCRATIC COMPLIANCE. FOR EACH, I WILL NOTE HOW STANLEY HOFFMANN'S DIFFERENTIATIONS WITHIN INTERNATIONAL LAW PRESENTED IN 'INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW' PROVIDE A VALUABLE CONTEXT FOR BETTER INTERPRETATION OF THE PATTERNS SCHOLARS HAVE OBSERVED. I CONCLUDE WITH THE PROBLEM OF DOMESTIC DEMOCRACY AND THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW AS FOUNDATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW. I WILL SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE LESS THAN PERFECT FOUNDATIONS AND ARE INSTEAD RIVALS AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. I WILL ILLUSTRATE THIS WITH COMMENTS ON RECENT US AND EUROPEAN JURISPRUDENCE.
980	THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT AND DISCUSS THE IDEA OF MATERIAL JUSTICE DEVELOPED BY MAX WEBER THROUGHOUT HIS WORK ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, AND ITS EFFECTS IN JUSTICE IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES. IT AIMS TO MAKE A CRITIC OF THE BASIC PREMISES OF LEGAL POSITIVISM IN THE LIGHT OF THE WEBERIAN THOUGHT AND DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ETHICAL CHARACTER OF THE LAW, AND THE NEED TO ENFORCE THE VALUES AND CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT FOR THE SOCIETY AND THE POLITICAL GOALS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE CHALLENGE IS TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES IMPEDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THE CONDITIONS THAT DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICS AND ECONOMY IN LAW TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT LAWS ARE PROPERLY ESTABLISHED.
981	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF CREDIT ACCESS IN MODULATING GOVERNANCE FOR GENDER-INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN 42 COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WITH DATA SPANNING THE PERIOD 2004-2014. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS IS USED AS EMPIRICAL STRATEGY. FINDINGS THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS ARE ESTABLISHED: FIRST, CREDIT ACCESS MODULATES GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW TO INDUCE POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON INCLUSIVE "PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION." SECOND, CREDIT ACCESS ALSO MODERATES POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW FOR OVERALL NET POSITIVE EFFECTS ON INCLUSIVE SECONDARY EDUCATION. THIRD, CREDIT ACCESS COMPLEMENTS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS TO ENGENDER AN OVERALL POSITIVE IMPACT ON INCLUSIVE TERTIARY EDUCATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED WITH EMPHASIS ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.
982	IN RESPONSE TO CALLS FOR AN AMNESTY AS ONE OF THE MEASURES TO BRING TO AN END THE 5-MONTH CONFLICTS ARISING FROM THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE EXTRADITION BILL, THE HKSAR GOVERNMENT SAID THAT IT HAS NO POWER TO GRANT AN AMNESTY AND THAT TO DO SO IS AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE REFUTES BOTH ARGUMENTS, AND ARGUES THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT LEGAL MEANS TO ALLOW THE HKSAR GOVERNMENT TO GRANT AMNESTY TO BOTH THE PROTESTERS AND THE POLICE; THAT GRANTING IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION ON GROUNDS OF PUBLIC INTEREST IS NOT CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW; AND THAT, IN LIGHT OF FOREIGN EXPERIENCE, THE SITUATION IN HONG KONG IS RIPE FOR A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THE GRANTING OF AMNESTY.
983	WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK OF FRIEDRICH AUGUST VON HAYEK, THIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF LAW FOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THE SYSTEMATIC PLACE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW IN HAYEK'S WORK IS TO BE FOUND IN HIS DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN TWO FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ORDER IN SOCIETY. THE THEORETICAL RELATION BETWEEN THE ORDER OF A SOCIETY AND ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IS EXPRESSED EMPIRICALLY. COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER REALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW REGULARLY HAVE A HIGHER INCOME PER CAPITA. WITH RESPECT TO TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES, IT THEREFORE COULD BE STATED THAT THE SUCCESS OF TRANSITION DEPENDS ALSO ON THE GRADE OF THE REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THOSE COUNTRIES.
984	LEGAL MOBILIZATION IS A CONTESTED TOPIC. THERE IS LITTLE CONSENSUS AMONG SCHOLARS REGARDING WHAT LEGAL MOBILIZATION IS, LET ALONE HOW IT FUNCTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE SEPARATION OR BALANCE OF POWERS DOCTRINE, THE LATTER WHICH CONCERNS THE FORMAL MANDATES OF PUBLIC ACTORS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS IN RELATION TO RULE OF LAW AS A FORM OF GOVERNANCE. WE ARGUE THAT THE USE OF LAW BY CIVIC ACTORS TO ADVANCE SOCIAL CHANGE SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE USE OF LAW BY STATES AND OTHER POWERFUL ACTORS TO SUBVERT THE RULE OF LAW OR TO SUPPRESS CRITICAL VOICES. THUS, IN DISTINGUISHING LEGAL MOBILIZATION FROM LAWFARE, WE ARGUE THAT LEGAL MOBILIZATION AS A LEGITIMATE FORM OF COUNTERPOWER TO LAWFARE HAS EMERGED AS A VIABLE AND IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF GOVERNANCE. PRAGMATICALLY SPEAKING, THE ILLEGITIMATE USE OF LAW BY AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES AND CORPORATIONS, THE EXISTENCE OF CORRUPTION AND BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LIMITATIONS OF FORMAL RULE OF LAW MECHANISMS TO DELIVER IMPARTIAL JUSTICE HAVE FORCED LEGAL ADVOCATES TO THINK CREATIVELY. IN THIS PAPER, AFTER CONCEPTUALIZING LEGAL MOBILIZATION AND LAWFARE AS OPPOSING USES OF LAW, WE ANALYSE THE POTENTIAL OF LEGAL MOBILIZATION AS COUNTERPOWER IN RELATION TO THE TRIAS POLITICA DOCTRINE, DRAWING ON A CASE STUDY OF MOBILIZING SINTI, ROMA AND TRAVELLER RIGHTS IN THE NETHERLANDS TO ANALYSE HOW LAW IS USED TO RESIST LAWFARE AND PURSUE SOCIAL JUSTICE.
985	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, NEXT TO A CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL TRADITION OF ROMAN LIBERTY, OFTEN LABELLED 'NEO-ROMAN' OR 'REPUBLICAN', WE SHOULD ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EXISTENCE OF, AT LEAST, TWO OTHER CONCEPTIONS OF LIBERTY, WHICH HAVE SO FAR REMAINED OCCLUDED UNDER THE PROMINENCE OF CICERO'S IDEAS AND THE APPROPRIATION OF THEM BY LATER THINKERS. BY ANALYSING THE DEBATE IN OPPOSITION AND IN FAVOUR OF SUMPTUARY LAWS ENACTED FROM THE 3RD CENTURY BC ONWARDS, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES A FIRST NOTION OF LIBERTY WHICH COINCIDED WITH THE ABSENCE OF ANY EXTERNAL LEGAL CONSTRAINTS UPON THE CITIZENS' PRIVATE LIFE AND WAS, THEREBY, INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS SPHERE. THE SECOND INTELLECTUAL FAMILY OF CONCEPTS EQUATED LIBERTAS TO THE ABSENCE OF CONSTRAINTS FROM ONE'S OWN PASSIONS AS WELL AS THE POSSESSION OF THE CAPACITY TO PURSUE SOMETHING WORTH PURSUING FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW, LIBERTY ALSO RESIDED IN THE SUPREMACY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE THIRD NOTION OF LIBERTAS, ELABORATED BY CICERO IN THE DE RE PUBLICA AND DE LEGIBUS, IDENTIFIED LIBERTY WITH THE ABSENCE OF ARBITRARY DOMINATION TO ACHIEVE ONE'S OWN ENDS AND RESIDED IN THE SUPREMACY OF THE RULE OF LAW. ITS PRESERVATION DEPENDED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE RELATED CIVIC STATUS OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
986	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT FEELING COMPASSION (AND OTHER RELATIONAL EMOTIONS) MAKES AN IMPORTANT, BENEFICIAL DIFFERENCE IN ADJUDICATION, AS IT IMPROVES THE EXERCISE OF THE PERSPECTIVAL IMAGINATION - THAT IS, IT HELPS A JUDGE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND, AND TO BETTER DESCRIBE, A SITUATION AS ANOTHER PERSON EXPERIENCED IT. EVEN WHERE A JUDGE HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED CAPACITY FOR EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY (THESE BEING COGNITIVE AND EVALUATIVE PROCESSES THAT ARE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM EMOTIONS), THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE GAINED BY A JUDGE ACTUALLY FEELING COMPASSION. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DISTORTION OF UNDERSTANDING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF FEELING COMPASSION, ANY SUCH FEELING HAS TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE ROBUST EXERCISE OF THE PERSPECTIVAL IMAGINATION - THAT IS, BY IMAGINING MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES (INCLUDING SOMETIMES CONSTRUCTING IMAGINARY ONES), SO AS TO AVOID PRIVILEGING ANY ONE PERSPECTIVE OVER OTHERS. IT IS FURTHER ARGUED THAT THIS IMAGINING BY FEELING', AS I CALL IT IN THIS PAPER, IS NOT A THREAT TO IMPARTIALITY OR THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IN FACT A CONDITION OF IT. IT IS PART OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOM WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. IMAGINING BY FEELING HELPS JUDGES TO BETTER HEAR' A GREATER DIVERSITY OF THOSE WHO COME BEFORE THEM, AND THUS HELPS THE JUDICIARY TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW.
987	STARTING IN 2014, BRAZILIAN POLITICS WAS SHAKEN UP BY THE LAVA JATO (LJ) OPERATION, A LAW-CENTERED ANTICORRUPTION INITIATIVE. LJ UNVEILED A LARGE CORRUPTION SCHEME IN BRAZIL'S NATIONAL OIL COMPANY PETROBRAS, WHICH INVOLVED PETROBRAS DIRECTORS, POLITICAL PARTY OFFICIALS, AND LARGE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES. LJ WAS BOTH DISRUPTIVE AND CONTENTIOUS. TO SOME, IT STARTED A NEW CHAPTER IN BRAZILIAN HISTORY, MARKED BY GREATER RESPECT FOR THE "RULE OF LAW" AND A COLLECTIVE "STATE OF MIND" CONCERNED WITH "ENDING IMPUNITY" AND BUILDING INTEGRITY IN POLITICS AND BUSINESSES. TO OTHERS, IT CONTRIBUTED TO UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, PAVING THE WAY FOR AN AUTOCRATIC LEADER-THE CURRENT BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS FURTHER LIGHT ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS BY LOOKING AT LJ AS A SITE OF "LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS" PRODUCTION. EMPIRICALLY, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON CONVERSATIONS GENERATED BY LEAD LJ PROSECUTORS ON A MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM (FACEBOOK) FROM 2017 TO 2019. CONSIDERING THIS BODY OF DATA, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: "WHEN PROSECUTORS AND 'THE PEOPLE' TALKED ABOUT LJ, WHAT DID THEY TALK ABOUT?" MY FINDINGS SUPPORT THE MORE SKEPTICAL VIEWS OF THE OPERATION. THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN LJ PROSECUTORS AND THEIR FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS SUPPORTED THE CO-PRODUCTION OF A CULTURAL SCHEMA AVERSE TO THE "RULE OF LAW." THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND ANTICORRUPTION RESEARCH.
988	MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS SEEKING TO OVERCOME THE "LIABILITY OF FOREIGNNESS" THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR OVERSEAS MARKETS FACE AN IMPORTANT TENSION IN CHOOSING BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES. FIRMS WHO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIGH-STATUS LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COOPERATION AND REDUCED CONFLICT WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. HOWEVER, THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS OF THIS STATUS CLIMBING STRATEGY MAY BE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN BECAUSE STAKEHOLDERS WITH LOW-STATUS, PARTICULARLY THOSE OUTSIDE THE FORMAL POLITICAL STRUCTURE, ARE MORE LIKELY TO INCREASE THEIR CONFLICT AS THE FIRM BECOMES INCREASINGLY DISTANT FROM THEM. AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY OF BRIDGING STRUCTURAL HOLES IN THE HOST COUNTRY STAKEHOLDER NETWORK ALSO FACES THEORETICAL LIMITS AS ACCESS TO SCARCE INFORMATION AND RESOURCES IS LIKELY TO ENGENDER CONFLICT WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THE STATUS CLIMBING STRATEGY IS MORE ATTRACTIVE WHERE INSIDER CONNECTIONS DOMINATE (I.E., THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK) WHILE THE BRIDGING STRATEGY IS MORE ATTRACTIVE IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONGER RULE OF LAW. IN OTHER WORDS, WE SHOW THAT AS THE RULE OF LAW STRENGTHENS, MULTINATIONAL ENTRANTS FOCUS MORE ON WHAT THEY KNOW RATHER THAN WHOM THEY KNOW. OUR ANALYSES USE A HAND-CODED DATA SET OF ALMOST 52,000 MEDIA-REPORTED STAKEHOLDER INTERACTIONS THAT CAPTURE THE NETWORK OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG 4,623 STAKEHOLDERS FROM 19 GOLD-MINING COMPANIES OPERATING 26 MINES IN 20 COUNTRIES, AND THE EVOLUTION OF THESE NETWORKS FROM 1993 UNTIL 2008.
989	OBJECTIVE IS DEMOCRACY NECESSARY FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE? ALTHOUGH IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THAT THERE IS A NATURAL CONNECTION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE, THERE IS REMARKABLY LITTLE EMPIRICAL WORK THAT TESTS THIS RELATIONSHIP CROSS-NATIONALLY. METHODS IN THIS ARTICLE, I FIRST FOCUS ON DISTINGUISHING ASPECTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND SEPARATE THEM CONCEPTUALLY FROM DEMOCRACY. SECOND, I OUTLINE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF REGIME MODELS THAT REPRESENT MODELS FOR EMULATION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIRD, USING DATA FROM 115 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2011, I QUANTITATIVELY ANALYZE WHICH OF THESE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN PRODUCING GOOD GOVERNANCE (WHICH IN PART EXPLAINS THE APPEAL OF SOME MODELS OVER OTHERS). RESULTS THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE (1) EITHER NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONE-PARTY REGIMES AND DEMOCRACIES IN TERMS OF THE PROMOTION OF RULE OF LAW OR EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD; AND (2) SOME TYPES OF SEMI-AUTHORITARIAN ONE-PARTY REGIMES ARE BETTER AT PROMOTING RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE THAN OTHER TYPES OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES-EQUALLY AS WELL AS DEMOCRACIES. CONCLUSION CONTRARY TO MUCH OF THE LITERATURE, DEMOCRACY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE NECESSARY FOR GOOD "ENOUGH" GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, IN THE LONG RUN, FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE "RULE OF LAW" TO FIRMLY TAKE ROOT (WHERE REGIME ELITES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY LAW), DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS MUST BE ULTIMATELY DEVELOPED.
990	THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE EXTINCTION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY OF POPULAR PARTICIPATION FAILS TO FULFILL THE FUNDAMENTAL DUTY OF NOT VIOLATING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE FIRST CHAPTER PRESENTS THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE ARTICLE, WHICH USES THOMAS S. KUHN'S EPISTEMOLOGY AND PARADIGM CONCEPT, REFORMULATED AS A DISCIPLINARY MATRIX IN HIS POST-CRITICAL WORKS, IN DIALOGUE WITH THE PROCEDURAL PARADIGM OF HABERMASIAN DISCURSIVE DEMOCRACY. IN THE SECOND CHAPTER, A REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND THE NORMATIVE-POLITICAL BASIS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND HUMAN DUTY TO RESPECT THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER IS CARRIED OUT, NOT PRACTICING ACTS OR MAKING SPEECHES THAT ATTEMPT AGAINST IT. IN THE THIRD CHAPTER, THROUGH A LOGICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHODOLOGY OF THE SEDIMENTED THEORIES, WE STUDY THE NORMATIVE ACT THAT EXTINGUISHED THE POLICY OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC COUNCILS AND ADIN 6.121-DF, FILED AGAINST THAT ACT. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES IN THE JUDGMENT LEGAL MATRICES STILL IN CONFLICT IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT ALL STF JUDGES EMPHASIZE THE VIRTUES OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY IN THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW PARADIGM. FINALLY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE EXTINCTION OF THE COUNCILS IN AN UNRESTRICTED WAY VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL DUTY OF NOT VIOLATING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, IN THE LIGHT OF HABERMAS' DISCURSIVE THEORY OF DEMOCRACY.
991	LEGAL POSITIVISM DOMINATES IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN IT AND NATURAL LAW, BUT CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WORK OF THOMAS HOBBES - THE ``FOUNDER'' OF THE POSITIVIST TRADITION - REVEALS A VERSION OF ANTI-POSITIVISM WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE CONTOURS OF THAT DEBATE. HOBBES'S ACCOUNT OF LAW TIES LAW TO LEGITIMACY THROUGH THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL ORDER IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING THE ORDER OF CIVIL SOCIETY; AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF LEGAL ORDER ARE STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IS INTRINSICALLY LEGITIMATE. I FOCUS ON HOBBES'S NEGLECTED CATALOGUE OF THE LAWS OF NATURE. ONLY THE FIRST GROUP GETS MUCH ATTENTION. ITS FUNCTION IS TO FACILITATE EXIT FROM THE STATE OF NATURE, AN EXIT WHICH HOBBES SEEMS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE. THE SECOND GROUP SETS OUT THE MORAL PSYCHOLOGY OF BOTH LEGISLATORS AND SUBJECTS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING LEGAL ORDER. THE THIRD SETS OUT THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH AN ORDER. THE SECOND AND THIRD GROUPS SHOW HOBBES NOT CONCERNED WITH SOLVING AN INSOLUBLE PROBLEM OF EXIT FROM THE STATE OF NATURE BUT WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEGITIMATE ORDER. BECAUSE A SOVEREIGN IS BY DEFINITION ONE WHO GOVERNS THROUGH LAW, HOBBES'S ABSOLUTISM IS CONSTRAINED. GOVERNMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IS GOVERNMENT SUBJECT TO THE MORAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF LEGAL ORDER.
992	THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON THE INTERNATIONAL NOTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL "SUSTAINABILITY" FROM THE NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE. AS A NORM, IT HAS BEEN COMMONLY ANALOGISED TO "JUSTICE" - MEANING THE FAILURE TO UPHOLD SUCH WOULD CONSTITUTE A "WRONG". AT ITS FACE VALUE, THIS POSITIVE UNDERSTANDING SHOULD BE WELCOMED AS IT SIGNALS AND PROMOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE TAKES THE ROLE OF THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND ARGUES THAT THIS ANALOGY DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. IT HAS OVER-GLORIFIED THE NOTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE INJUSTICE IS - AT LEAST IN THEORY - AN ABSOLUTE WRONG IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT UNSUSTAINABILITY IS NOT. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PUBLIC IS BEING INCREASINGLY INSTILLED WITH THE NORMATIVE IDEA THAT UNSUSTAINABILITY IS WRONG. ON THE OTHER HAND, UNSUSTAINABLE ACTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY OUTLAWED AND MAY EVEN BE ENDORSED. THIS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS PERCEPTION BECAUSE THE LAW, IN EFFECT, IS SELECTIVELY ALLOWING AND SANCTIONING DIFFERENT ACTS INVOLVING THE EXACT SAME WRONG. THIS GOES AGAINST THE RULE-OF-LAW REQUIREMENT OF CONSISTENCY. IF THE WORLD TRULY CARES ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY, IT SHOULD BE ACCORDED THE SAME PARAMOUNT STATUS AS "JUSTICE", SO THAT IT WILL BE UPHELD TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE EXTENT. IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, THERE IS STILL A PRESSING NEED TO STATE THE STANDING OF THE NORM, ACCURATELY, TO AVOID CREATING AN EXPECTATION GAP AND CAUSING FURTHER HARM TO THE RULE OF LAW.
993	THE PAPER FOCUSES ON THE POTENTIAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ANALYSING THE EFFECTIVE OPERATION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. THIS APPROACH LINKS NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO LEGAL RESEARCH. APPLYING ADVANCED SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY OF LAW, THE PAPER ANALYSES HOW SOCIAL AND LEGAL CHANGE AFFECT DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY, AND FOCUSES THE ANALYSIS ON A COMPARATIVE SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES ALONG A GEOGRAPHICAL ROUTE LINKING ASIA WITH EUROPE AND VICE VERSA, VAGUELY REMINISCENT OF THE HISTORICAL SILK ROADS ON LAND AND BY SEA. SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY SUGGESTS ANALYSING SOCIAL AND LEGAL CHANGE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS OF WORLD SOCIETY RATHER THAN FROM A NORMATIVE LEGAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH HAS INDIVIDUAL TERRITORIAL STATES AND THEIR NATIONAL STATE LAW AS A POINT OF REFERENCE. THE FUNCTIONAL SYSTEMS OF WORLD SOCIETY, SUCH AS FAMILIES (THE FAMILY SYSTEM), ECONOMICS (THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM), POLITICS (THE POLITICAL SYSTEM), CIVIL SOCIETY AND LAW (THE LEGAL SYSTEM) CAN BE SEEN AS BOTH EXERTING STRESS ON EACH OTHER AND ADJUSTING TO THIS STRESS BY A STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN LOCAL POPULATIONS WITH SUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL ADAPTABILITY TOWARDS A HIGHER DIFFERENTIATION OF ALL SOCIAL STRUCTURES. THE RULE OF LAW EMERGES AS A SPECIAL PATTERN OF THIS STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIATION WHICH COMPOUNDS THE STRUCTURAL ADAPTABILITY OF ABOVE ALL IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WORLD-WIDE. IN TURN, THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONDITION FOR INCREASING THE ADAPTIVE FLEXIBILITY OF SOCIAL STRUCTURES IN LOCAL POPULATIONS. THE RULE OF LAW IS, THEREFORE, A CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN THE ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY. THIS PATTERN IS NOT HISTORICALLY GIVEN ONCE AND FOR ALL. NOR IS IT LINKED TO PARTICULAR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS. UNDERSTOOD IN THIS WAY, THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT A NORMATIVE POLITICAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL WISH-LIST BUT A SOCIAL PHENOMENON WHICH CAN PROVIDE COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW WITH A USEFUL SET OF INDICATORS FOR DESCRIBING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY AND ITS LAW.
994	THE ARTICLE IS DEDICATED TO THE RESULTS OF THIRTY YEARS ACTIVITY OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW (VENICE COMMISSION OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE), WHICH IS A RECOGNIZED EXPERT CENTER IN THE FIELD OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. RUSSIA HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING IN ITS WORK SINCE 2002. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO SHOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE VC EXPERT OPINIONS' PROBLEMATICS FROM THE GENERAL PROBLEMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TO THE SPECIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTIONS, THE ASSESSMENT OF ELECTORAL SYSTEMS, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUSTICE, GUARANTEES OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. THIS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS CONTRIBUTES TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN STAGES OF THE COMMISSIONS' FORMATION ARE CONSIDERED. THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE EXPANSION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL SPHERE OF VENICE COMMISSION'S INFLUENCE AND THE STRENGTHENING OF ITS ROLE IN THE POLITICAL-LEGAL AND SCIENTIFIC-LEGAL FIELDS. THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO FILL AN OBVIOUS GAP IN THE DOMESTIC SCIENCE OF COMPARATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, SINCE THERE ARE ONLY A FEW SPECIAL WORKS DEDICATED TO THE VENICE COMMISSION. THE ARTICLE SETS OUT TASKS THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHAPING OF NEW DIRECTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL SCIENCE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE COMMISSION AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THE WORK IS INTENDED FOR SCIENTISTS SPECIALIZING IN COMPARATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, TEACHERS AND STUDENTS STUDYING THE LAW OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. AN OPTIONAL SEMINAR ON THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE VENICE COMMISSION WAS ORGANIZED AT THE MASTER'S PROGRAM OF THE INSTITUTE OF LEGISLATION AND COMPARATIVE LAW UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.
995	DUE TO ITS IMPORTANCE, LANDSCAPE SHOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC LEGAL PROTECTION. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES ITS VALUE AS A RESOURCE THAT INFLUENCES THE QUALITY OF LIFE, AS A VITAL ELEMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND FOR THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRY. FURTHERMORE, LANDSCAPE IS IDENTIFIED AS A COLLECTIVE RIGHT PROTECTED BY THE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION, THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN TERRITORIAL MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING DECISIONS.
996	IN THIS COMMENTARY, THE LEGAL DISCOURSES IN CONFLICT EVOLVING AROUND THE 2014 OCCUPY MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG ARE ANALYSED WITH LEMKE'S THEORIZATION OF TEXTUAL SEMANTICS AND GOFFMAN'S PARTICIPATION FRAMEWORK. SPECIFICALLY, I ANALYSE THE THEMATIC PATTERNS OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN THE TELEVIZED MEETING BETWEEN THE HKSAR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF HONG KONG FEDERATION OF STUDENTS ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM ON 21 OCTOBER2014. IT IS REVEALED THAT BOTH SIDES NOT ONLY CONSTRUCT DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO SHOW DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONAL STANCES TOWARDS HONG KONG AND CHINA. I THEN PROPOSE A MORE PLURAL UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER AND EXPLORATION OF THE OTHER'S DISCOURSE HISTORIES AS ONE STRATEGY AND THE FIRST STEP TO GOING BEYOND BINARISM ON THE ROAD OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN HONG KONG.
997	THE INTENSIFICATION OF THE CHALLENGES, THREATS AND RISKS OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND THE UNREADINESS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIES TO RESIST THEIR DESTABILIZING EFFECTS LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW PARADIGM OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER, AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF WHICH IS CORRUPTION. THE SPREAD OF CORRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL DIMENSION INTENSIFIES THE DISPARITIES IN THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEMS AND CREATES OBSTACLES TO THE LEGAL AND SOCIO-POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE COUNTRY, AS THIS DESTRUCTIVE PHENOMENON PENETRATES NOT ONLY THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUT ALSO THE ECONOMY, POLITICS AND SOCIETY, AND IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POPULATION, WHICH IS MANIFESTED IN THE ENRICHMENT OF A SMALL PROPORTION AND THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. THE ARTICLE DEFINES THE ESSENCE OF CORRUPTION SUBSTANTIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POPULATION. THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF NORMATIVE AND LEGAL SUPPORT OF COUNTERACTING CORRUPTION IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IN UKRAINE IS CARRIED OUT. A STUDY OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND UKRAINE DURING 2018-2021 IS CONDUCTED. BASED ON MULTIFACTOR (CLUSTER) ANALYSIS USING THE K-MEANS METHOD, THE GROUPING OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND UKRAINE BY THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX IS CARRIED OUT, WHICH ALLOWED TO DISTINGUISH THREE GROUPS AMONG THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION: (1) HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHICH HAVE A HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE AND LOW LEVELS OF CORRUPTION; (2) HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHICH PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT CORRUPTION IS HIGH ENOUGH; (3) COUNTRIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF QUALITY OF LIFE, INCLUDING UKRAINE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE COUNTERACTION TO CORRUPTION, THE MAIN MEASURES TO COMBAT THIS DESTRUCTIVE PHENOMENON HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH REQUIRES THE IMPROVEMENT OF CURRENT LEGISLATION AND ITS HARMONIZATION WITH INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS.
998	IN RECENT YEARS, THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS DECLARED THAT ITS GOVERNANCE MUST DOMINATE OVER ALL ASPECTS OF LAW-MAKING AND ENFORCEMENT, DECLARING THAT ITS LEADERSHIP MUST BE IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF GOVERNING THE COUNTRY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. CONTEMPORANEOUS TO THIS NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THE LAW-PARTY NEXUS IS A PROPAGANDA PUSH TO INTEGRATE MORAL VALUES INTO THE LAW. THIS PAPER IS ABOUT MORALIZING GOVERNANCE IN THE XI JINPING ERA. IT EXPLORES THE IDEOLOGY BEHIND THE PROMOTION OF THIS MORALS-LAW INTEGRATION, FOCUSING ON THE SOCIALIST CORE VALUES IN THE LEGAL REALM UNDER THE CURRENT XI JINPING ADMINISTRATION. WE DO SO FROM TWO INTERRELATED PERSPECTIVES. THE FIRST EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND MORALITY. HERE, WE ARGUE THAT THE PARTY'S CALLS FOR A LAW-MORALITY AMALGAM CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A FORM OF PAN-MORALISM. THE SECOND LOOKS AT THE SUPREMACY OF PARTY RULE, EXTENDING THE THEORY OF THE LEVIATHAN PROPOSED BY THOMAS HOBBES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTY'S MORALITY PUSH. THIS TWO-PRONGED ARGUMENT ENABLES US TO ASSERT THAT THE XI JINPING ADMINISTRATION IS CREATING A VIRTUOUS LEVIATHAN.
999	IN THIS PAPER I REASSESS THE PLACE OF PLATO'S LAWS IN THE HISTORY OF LEGAL THOUGHT. THE LAWS HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED TO PRESENT A NATURAL LAW THEORY OF LAW. I ARGUE INSTEAD THAT IT PRESENTS A POSITIVIST ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE OF LAW. THROUGH ANALYSIS OF SOME KEY PASSAGES OF THE LAWS I ARGUE THAT IN THAT DIALOGUE LAW IS IDENTIFIED WITH CONCLUSIONS OF ENKRATIC CIVIC REASON THAT MAY SYSTEMATICALLY CONFLICT WITH PRECEPTS OF SUBSTANTIVE MORAL REASON. I ALSO ARGUE THAT IN THE LAWS THE RULE OF LAW IS A PRECONDITION OF A LEGAL SYSTEM BUT LACKS INHERENT MORAL SIGNIFICANCE. FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO OBTAIN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF RULERS AND SUBJECTS WHICH IS GROUNDED ON POLITICAL PRAGMATISM AND NOT ON MORAL CONSIDERATIONS.
