0	THIS PAPER APPLIES THE RULE OF LAW TEST TO EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ADOPTED TO COMBAT A NATIONAL DISASTER IN SOUTH AFRICA. A DECLARATION OF A NATIONAL STATE OF DISASTER, SUCH AS A PANDEMIC, TRIGGERS EMERGENCY POWERS WHICH ENABLE THE EXECUTIVE TO MITIGATE THE DISASTER, ASSIST AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC, PROVIDE RELIEF, AND PROTECT PROPERTY. HOWEVER, EMERGENCY POWERS PROVIDE A PRETEXT FOR THE EXECUTIVE TO LIMIT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND TO CURTAIL THE ENJOYMENT OF FREEDOMS. THESE UNPRECEDENTED POWERS ALSO POSE A RISK OF ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWER, WHICH CAN ONLY BE PREVENTED IF THE PROMULGATION, ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF EMERGENCY REGULATIONS CONFORM TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, RATIONALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE UNDERSTOOD AS TENETS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH AFRICA. THEY REQUIRE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO RESPECT, PROTECT AND PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO VIOLATION BY THE STATE. GIVEN THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE LITIGATION AGAINST THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ADOPTED IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THIS PAPER ALSO DISCUSSES THE ENSUING CASE LAW TO ILLUSTRATE THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TEST TO A NATIONAL DISASTER.
1	LOOKING AT HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS PROTECTED, DEFENDED, OR EVEN ADVANCED BY NON-STATE ACTORS OPERATING BELOW THE STATE LEVEL IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING HOW RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES GET RECOGNIZED, OPERATIONALIZED, AND IMPLEMENTED. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A GROWING STRAND OF SCHOLARSHIP LOOKING AT HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS PROTECTED AND BOLSTERED 'FROM BELOW.' IT DOES THIS BY EXPLORING THE ROLE OF A SPECIFIC TYPE OF CIVIL SOCIETY ACTOR IN THE DOCUMENTATION AND INVESTIGATION OF SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AND EFFORTS AT ACCOUNTABILITY, NAMELY THE UNIVERSITY. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THERE HAS BEEN A TRANSFORMATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS FACT-FINDING AND HOW IT IMPACTS THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMES. UNIVERSITIES, OFTEN THROUGH THEIR LEGAL CLINICS, ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY EFFORTS. IT EXPLORES WHAT IMPLICATIONS THE ROLE OF INDEPENDENT DOCUMENTER OR INVESTIGATOR HAS FOR ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN PROTECTING AND ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW. IT CALLS FOR GREATER RECOGNITION OF SOCIETAL ENGAGEMENT WITH UNIVERSITIES AND FOR MORE RESEARCH ON THE IMPACTS OF UNIVERSITIES AND STUDENTS ON ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL CRIMES.
2	THE EUROPEAN OMBUDSMAN IS A NEW KIND OF 'AGENT', WHOSE STATUS AND ROLE REMAIN UNCLEAR. ON THE ONE HAND, IT IS FORMALLY A PARLIAMENTARY BODY, DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE CONTROL OF EU INSTITUTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIONS BY MEPS; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PROFILE AND ROLE OF THIS ORGAN IS CLOSE TO THAT OF A COURT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE HYBRID NATURE OF THIS ORGAN IS THE REASON FOR ITS SUCCESS. THE POWERS OF THE OMBUDSMAN, LIMITED AS THEY ARE, GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMBINE THE INSTRUMENTS OF PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY AND JUDICIAL CONTROL IN AN ORIGINAL WAY. AS SUCH IT IS WELL EQUIPPED TO SCRUTINIZE THOSE AGENTS WHICH CANNOT BE SUBMITTED TO CLASSIC PARLIAMENTARY CONTROLS WITHOUT LOSING THEIR INDEPENDENCE, AND THEREBY HELPS TO RECONCILE EXECUTIVE DELEGATION WITH PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.
3	THE SUBJECT CAPABLE OF LIBERAL LEGALITY OUGHT TO BE REVISED SUCH THAT THE SELF-SUFFICIENT AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUAL COHABITS WITH A PASSIVE SELF ALWAYS ALREADY BURDENED WITH RESPONSIBILITIES SHE DID NOT CHOOSE. THIS ESSAY USES THE PHILOSOPHY OF EMMANUEL LEVINAS TO DELINEATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THIS NEW SUBJECTIVITY TO LIBERAL THEORIES OF JUSTICE, AND REVEALS A PRODUCTIVE AMBIVALENCE WITH REGARD TO JUSTICE RESIDING WITHIN RULE OF LAW SCHOLARSHIP: WHY IS IT THAT WE SOMETIMES HAVE TO TRANSGRESS THE RULE OF LAW IN ORDER TO DO JUSTICE TO WHAT IT STANDS FOR? EMERGING DEBATES ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION HELP US THINK THROUGH THIS QUESTION IN ITS CONCRETE URGENCY. THE LINKAGE THEN DEMONSTRATES THAT LAW'S JUSTICE EXISTS ONLY AS A DELICATE AND NEVERCONCLUDED BALANCING PROCESS BETWEEN THE DEMANDS OF ETHICS AND THOSE OF POLITICS-A PROCESS OF BALANCING THAT IS MIRRORED IN THE NEW ACCOUNT OF A SUBJECT WHO ASPIRES TO JUSTICE AND THEREFORE MAKES JUSTICE BEYOND STRICT LEGALITY POSSIBLE. AMBIVALENCE IS INEVITABLE, BUT ITS EFFECTS ARE NOT LIMITED TO NIHILISTIC RESIGNATION. RATHER, AMBIVALENCE CAN POINT OUT FOR US MANI-FEST RESPONSIBILITIES TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY LIBERALISM'S AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUALIZED SUBJECT.
4	CHINA AND WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE REPEATEDLY PORTRAYED EACH OTHER AS POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL ADVERSARIES IN CYBERSPACE. YET, BOTH SIDES PROCLAIM THAT THEY SUBSCRIBE TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT CYBER OPERATIONS MUST BE SUBJECTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES FIVE KEY ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CYBERSPACE, WHICH ARE ORDINARILY UNDERSTOOD AS AREAS OF CONTENTION: (1) PREFERRED METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW; (2) COMPETING MODELS OF CYBERSPACE GOVERNANCE; (3) APPLICATION OF SOVEREIGNTY TO CYBERSPACE; (4) QUESTION OF MILITARIZATION OF CYBERSPACE; AND (5) LEGALITY OF CYBER ESPIONAGE. OUR ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS INACCURATE TO VIEW CHINA AND THE WEST AS SHARPLY DIVIDED AND COMPETING CAMPS. RATHER, THE EMERGING PICTURE REVEALS A WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS AND VIEWS THAT REFLECT AN OVERALL TRAJECTORY OF CONVERGENCE, EVEN IF MODEST IN SCOPE AND VELOCITY.
5	IN RECENT TIMES, THE CJEU HAS STARTED TO DEVELOP ITS JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO THE "RULE OF LAW CRISIS" IN SOME MEMBER STATES. ON THE ONE HAND, THIS NEW TREND HAS EMERGED ALSO AS A REACTION TO SOME NATIONAL REFORMS CONCERNING ASYLUM AND MIGRATION LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CJEU IN PROTECTING THE EU FOUNDING VALUES HAS DEPLOYED ITS "TRADITIONAL" COMPETENCES ATTRIBUTED TO IT BY THE EU TREATIES, NAMELY THE MECHANISMS OF THE PRELIMINARY RULING PROCEDURE AND THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS CONTRIBUTION AIMS AT INVESTIGATING THIS NEW CJEU'S JURISPRUDENCE THROUGH THE LENS OF THE GLOBAL COMPACTS ON REFUGEES AND MIGRATION. THIS WILL LEAD US TO REFLECT ON HOW THE CJEU'S CASELAW COULD BE SEEN AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS, AT LEAST WITHIN THE EU, AND INDIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASING COMPLIANCE WITH SOME OF THE COMMITMENTS LAID DOWN IN THE GLOBAL COMPACTS, REGARDLESS OF THE POSITION TAKEN BY SOME RECALCITRANT EU MEMBER STATES WITH RESPECT TO THESE DOCUMENTS.
6	GLOBAL EFFORTS TO PROTECT BIODIVERSITY AND SLOW DEFORESTATION RELY HEAVILY ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTED AREAS; LAND SET ASIDE THAT CANNOT BE DEFORESTED OR DEVELOPED. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE MACRO-LEVEL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND VARIATION IN AVOIDED DEFORESTATION FROM PROTECTED AREAS. USING RECENT GLOBAL SATELLITE DATA FROM 2000 TO 2012, I ESTIMATE THE COUNTRY-LEVEL AVOIDED DEFORESTATION OF PROTECTED AREAS ESTABLISHED IN THIS PERIOD VIA NEAREST-NEIGHBOR MATCHING. I THEN USE WEIGHTED LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSIONS TO EXPLAIN COUNTRY-LEVEL VARIATION IN ESTIMATED AVOIDED DEFORESTATION AS A FUNCTION OF A COUNTRY'S GOVERNANCE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRY LEVEL CONTROLS. ACROSS 71 COUNTRIES IN THIS STUDY PERIOD, PROTECTED AREAS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION CONTROL AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, PROTECTED AREAS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN MORE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL STABILITY AND AVOIDED DEFORESTATION FROM PROTECTED AREAS.
7	THE AFRICAN CONTINENT HAS BEEN BESIEGED A BY VAST RANGE OF PROBLEMS IN MODERN TIMES. THESE INCLUDE ABNORMALLY HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY; INCESSANT OUTBREAKS OF WAR; INEPTITUDE OF ITS LEADERS AND THEIR RELUCTANCE TO RELINQUISH POWER; CORRUPTION; AND PERSISTENT UNDER-DEVELOPMENT. THESE PROBLEMS STEM PRINCIPALLY FROM THE FAILURE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ON THE CONTINENT. IT IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE INABILITY OF THE LAW TO RULE, AND TO PROVIDE A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR GROWTH AND NATION BUILDING. THIS ARTICLE TRACES ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE CONTINUED FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA TO THE FOUNDATIONAL LAW IN MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES, THE CONSTITUTION, AND IN PARTICULAR, THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTION IS MADE.
8	THE RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF THE CORE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER - THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION - JURISDICTION OF THE COURT ON THE BASIS OF A COMBINED READING OF ARTICLES 2 AND 19 TEU - PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY - PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER - LIMITS TO THE SCOPE OF APPLICATION OF EU LAW
9	THE 21ST CENTURY MAY SAFELY BE CALLED THE 'URBAN ERA'. THE YEAR 2007 MARKED THE MOMENT WHEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MODERN HISTORY, OVER 50% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVED IN URBAN AREAS. BY THE YEAR 2050 ALMOST 70% OF HUMANITY IS PROJECTED TO BE URBAN, I.E., A HUMAN SETTLEMENT WITH USUALLY A HIGH POPULATION DENSITY AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WHILE THE ROLE OF LARGE CITIES, METROPOLITAN AREAS AND URBAN REGIONS HAS BEEN INCREASING, THE POLITICAL DOMAIN OF THE STATES, OF WHICH THESE CITIES OR REGIONS CONSTITUTIONALLY FORM PART, SEEMS TO BE CONTINUOUSLY SHRINKING. AND ALTHOUGH THE RISE OF THE URBAN IS UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SOVEREIGN-STATE MODEL, THE IDEA OF STATES AS HAVING FINAL AUTHORITY IS SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED. THIS IS CAUSED BY AT LEAST TWO SIMULTANEOUSLY OCCURRING TRENDS: THE TRANSFER OF TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UPWARDS, TO THE INTERNATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL, THROUGH PROCESSES OF GLOBALIZATION AND A DEVELOPMENT DOWNWARDS, TO THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL (OR EVEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR DISTRICT), THROUGH PROCESSES OF DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONALIZATION. THESE COMBINED TRENDS HAVE BEEN CALLED GLOCALIZATION, A PROCESS EXEMPLARY FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF MODERN SOCIETY, IN WHICH AUTHORITY SHIFTS FROM HIERARCHY TO NETWORKS, AND THE AUTONOMY AND UNITY OF THE CENTRAL AND SOVEREIGN STATE ARE UNDER PRESSURE. THIS SPECIAL ISSUE IS THE FRUIT OF A WORKSHOP ORGANIZED AT TILBURG LAW SCHOOL ON 25 NOVEMBER 2022, DEDICATED TO THE EXPLORATION OF SEVERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES POSED BY WHAT WE HAVE DUBBED URBAN CONSTITUTIONALISM.
10	MODERN DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS MEDIATE THE TENSION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH INSTITUTIONS THAT CHECK UNRESTRAINED POPULAR RULE WITH EXPERT JUDICIAL BODIES. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT THAT EXISTED IN ANCIENT ATHENS, WHERE CHECKS ON POPULAR RULE COEXISTED WITH STRONG POPULAR CONTROL. JUDICIAL REVIEW IN ATHENS, HOWEVER, RAISED TWO ADDITIONAL THREATS TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW: UNPREDICTABILITY AND PARTISANSHIP. WE COMBINE A FORMAL MODEL WITH HISTORICAL EXEGESIS TO SHOW HOW THE STRATEGIC INCENTIVES OF ATHENIAN INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, ALONG WITH A STRONG SOCIETAL CONSENSUS ON THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, WERE NECESSARY INGREDIENTS FOR DISPELLING BOTH THREATS. IN ATHENS, INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIVE TO CITIZENS' DEMANDS EXISTED ALONGSIDE A ROBUST RULE OF LAW. THIS CASE STUDY PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ALLOWING US TO REFLECT ON THE FEASIBILITY OF EXTENSIVE DEMOCRATIC INPUT TO THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW.

11	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE USEFULNESS TO BUSINESS EDUCATION OF AESTHETICS, LITERATURE AND THE ANCIENT IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. RECENT FINANCIAL SCANDALS HAVE EXPOSED A RANGE OF VULNERABILITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND, INCREASINGLY, BIG BUSINESS IS SEARCHING FOR ETHICAL ANSWERS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP THE NECESSARY CRITICAL, ANALYTICAL AND EMPATHIC QUALITIES OF, IN PARTICULAR, THE BUSINESS STUDENT IN ORDER THAT FUTURE GLOBAL CORPORATE LEADERS MIGHT ALSO BE MORAL MANAGERS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE ABSTRACT YET FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS REWORKED IN ORDER TO WIDEN ITS APPLICATION TO BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ENSURE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE INTELLECTUAL SENSIBILITIES NEED TO BE STIMULATED BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES FORMAT, LOOKING TO VARIOUS EXAMPLES FROM THE LIBERAL ARTS. THE PAPER PROPOSES GREATER ATTENTION TO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CLASSICS, AS THE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM FICTION ARE HIGHLY PERTINENT TO MODERN LEADERSHIP AND CORPORATE CONDUCT IN GENERAL. FINDINGS - THERE IS A RELATIVELY NEW LITERARY GENRE OF BUSINESS BOOKS WHICH IS INSPIRED BY CLASSIC AND POPULAR WORKS OF LITERATURE, FOR EXAMPLE POWER PLAYS: SHAKESPEARE'S LESSONS IN LEADERSHIP; HOWEVER, SUCH BOOKS ARE YET TO APPEAR REGULARLY ON BUSINESS SCHOOL RECOMMENDED READING LISTS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS FOR A RADICAL CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT STYLE, ONE BEING THAT THE SINGLE-MINDED PURSUIT OF PROFIT HAS RECENTLY PRODUCED AN UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE PAPER PROPOSES THAT, BY PLACING A GREATER EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPING THE INTELLECTUAL AND EMPATHIC SENSIBILITIES, FUTURE MANAGERS MAY BE ABLE TO ADOPT A MORE CONSCIONABLE APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND WIDER SOCIETAL CONCERNS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AN ALARMINGLY AMORAL AND INEPT SET OF GLOBAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, THE PAPER URGES A RADICAL RETURN TO A CLASSICAL OR LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION FOR THE BUSINESS STUDENT. A RE-IMAGING OF THE TRADITIONAL RULE OF LAW ALSO PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR DECIDING THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION; TAILORED TO MEET THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE MODERN BUSINESS COMMUNITY.
12	THE CONCERN WITH CITIZENSHIP IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS IS ESPECIALLY NOTICED WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE THAT MOVE TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. IN FACE OF THAT ISSUE, THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT "THE RIGHT TO HAVE RIGHT" OF THE DISPLACED. CURRENTLY, IN THE CONTEXT OF WARS IN THE EAST, SOME OF WHICH INCLUDE DIRECT INTERFERENCE BY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE SITUATIONS OF EXTREME POVERTY THAT AFFLICT OTHER REGIONS OF THE GLOBE, A LARGE QUANTITIY OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING. THESE DISPLACED HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A HARD TIME ATTAINING JUDICIAL PROTECTION THROUGH THE BASIC RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP RECOGNIZED FOR NATIONALS. IN FACE OF THIS REALITY, THE TEXT AIMS TO CONFRONT THE ISSUE OF THE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS' GRANTING LEGITIMACY, WITH THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING CITIZENSHIP AS A CAPABILITY THAT IS INDEPENDENT FROM A PERMANENT LINK WITH A STATE POWER CENTER.
13	IMPROVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS THE COMMON GOAL OF MODERN REFORMS TO THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CASE MANAGEMENT IS THE METHOD INITIATED BY THE JUDICIARY AND LAW REFORM BODIES TO CONTROL THE CONDUCT OF CIVIL PROCEEDINGS TO ENSURE THAT THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE OF ENHANCING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS ACHIEVED. THE QUESTION POSED BY THIS ARTICLE IS, DO THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF CASE MANAGEMENT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW? THE PROCEDURAL PHILOSOPHY UNDERLYING CASE MANAGEMENT REQUIRES JUDGES TO RATION THE PROCEDURAL DEVICES WHICH TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO PARTIES. SUCH RATIONING WILL SOMETIMES IMPEDE THE ABILITY OF A PARTY TO ACQUIRE FACTS TO SUPPORT A CASE OR PREVENT A PARTY FROM PRESENTING AN ARGUABLE CASE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PRINCIPLED RATIONING OF PROCEDURAL PROCESSES IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE WITHOUT DEROGATING FROM THE PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT SETTLEMENT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO ADJUDICATION AND THE RULE OF LAW.
14	THIS ESSAY EXAMINES HOW BEIJING'S ESCALATING CRACKDOWN ON HONG KONG HAS SYSTEMATICALLY IMPOSED AUTHORITARIAN POLICIES THAT UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, ABANDONING CHINA'S COMMITMENTS BOTH TO THE HONG KONG PEOPLE AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. MAIN ARGUMENT CONFIDENCE IN THE "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" MODEL CHINA PROMISED HONG KONG HAS SLOWLY DRAINED AWAY IN THE YEARS SINCE THE 1997 HANDOVER. IN 2019, AS "ONE COUNTRY" SEEMED SET TO GOBBLE UP "TWO SYSTEMS" UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A PROPOSED LAW TO ALLOW THE EXTRADITION OF ACCUSED FROM HONG KONG TO THE MAINLAND, THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG STAGED ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST EVER PROTESTS TO DEMAND THE AUTONOMY, RULE OF LAW, AND BASIC FREEDOMS THEY WERE PROMISED IN THE CITY'S BASIC LAW. IN THE FACE OF GOVERNMENT INDIFFERENCE AND AGGRESSIVE POLICE TACTICS, THESE PROTESTS MORPHED INTO A CONFRONTATION THAT CARRIED ON FOR MONTHS THROUGHOUT THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. IN 2020, BEIJING RESPONDED WITH A TOTAL CRACKDOWN, IMPOSING A NATIONAL SECURITY LAW THAT UNDERMINED THE CORE LIBERAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE LONG SUSTAINED HONG KONG. TO ENSURE ABSOLUTE CONTROL, BEIJING THIS YEAR AMENDED THE BASIC LAW TO IMPOSE NEW RULES UNDER WHICH ELECTORAL COMMITTEES CAN BAR FROM THE POLITICAL PROCESS ANYONE DEEMED DISLOYAL TO THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY REGIME. THE NEW RULES CREATE AN ELECTORAL MODEL THAT PROFOUNDLY VIOLATES THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO HONG KONG. POLICY IMPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND ORGANIZATIONS CAN PLAY A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE BY FOCUSING ON MEETING GRASSROOT CONCERNS. IN THIS REGARD, RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT FOR AUTONOMOUS TERRITORIAL ENTITIES, SUCH AS HONG KONG, COULD BE CONDITIONED ON ADHERENCE TO RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENTS TO SECURE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO ENCOURAGE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT ON CRITICAL ISSUES RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS OUGHT TO BE MULTILATERAL, TARGETED, AND INVOLVE CLEAR MESSAGING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IF CHINESE AND HONG KONG OFFICIALS REMAIN INDIFFERENT TO BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS, IMMEDIATE POLICIES WILL NEED TO FOCUS ON THE EXIT AND IMMIGRATION CONCERNS HONG KONG RESIDENTS WILL FACE AS THEY SEEK TO ESCAPE THE REPRESSIVE CONDITIONS BEING IMPOSED.
15	INTERNATIONAL LAW EXISTS IN THE SLIPPERY ZONE BETWEEN ABSTRACT SPECULATION ON BINDING PRINCIPLES AND REALISTIC DEFERENCE TO POWER. THE POSITION OF HUGO GROTIUS AS 'FATHER' OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, THIS ARTICLE WILL SUGGEST, RESULTS FROM THE WAY LATER LAWYERS HAVE APPRECIATED HIS SUGGESTION THAT WHEN HUMAN BEINGS ENTER THAT ZONE, THEY WILL DISCOVER A TENDENCY TO SUBORDINATE THEMSELVES TO 'RULES' THAT IS LACKING FROM OTHER LIVING CREATURES. GROTIUS THEN USES THIS ASSUMED TENDENCY TO EXPLAIN THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH MEMBERS OF GOOD SOCIETIES AGREE TO LIVE IN PEACE AND EXPECT MUTUAL BENEFITS FROM COOPERATING WITH EACH OTHER. THE SAME TENDENCY ALSO ENTITLES THEM TO PUNISH THOSE WHO QUESTION THE BENEFICIAL NATURE OF THESE RULES OR LAY DOWN OBSTACLES TO THEIR EXPANSION. THE IMPORTANCE OF GROTIUS IN THE HISTORY OF LEGAL THOUGHT IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE IDEA (THOUGH NOT THE EXPRESSION) OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' EMERGES IN DE IURE BELLI AC PACIS (1625) AS A POWERFUL JUSTIFICATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF A POST-FEUDAL, COMMERCIAL STATE.
16	PROCEDURAL STANDARDS OF PARTICIPATION HAVE THE CAPACITY TO STRUCTURE AND CONSTRAIN THE EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY. FOCUSING ON THE WAY DECISIONS ARE FORMED, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE DEPLETION OF SUCH STANDARDS IN PROCESSES OF RECEPTION OF TRANSNATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL DECISIONS WITHIN THE EU POTENTIALLY LEADS TO SITUATIONS OF UNRESTRAINED AUTHORITY AND CAN CONSTITUTE A CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT SETS OUT THE BASIS FOR A CONCEPTUAL AND NORMATIVE ANALYSIS UNDERPINNING THE ARGUMENT THAT PROCEDURAL STANDARDS OF PARTICIPATION CAN BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE DEPLETION OF SUCH STANDARDS IS ONE FACET OF A BROADER PROBLEM. INTERTWINED DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES THAT CUT ACROSS EU AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE CHALLENGE THE ABILITY OF LAW TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE ACTION. THE CHALLENGES THAT INTERNATIONALIZED RULEMAKING PROCEDURES POSE TO LAW CAN ONLY BE APPREHENDED IF THEY ARE SEEN IN THEIR ENTIRETY AS SEGMENTS OF A BROADER REGULATORY CYCLE. ON THIS BASIS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES THAT OPERATE THE SUBSTANTIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT SITES OF GOVERNANCE. HAVING AN EU FOCUS, THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CURRENT REALITIES OF THE DIFFUSION OF POWER RESULTING FROM INTERNATIONALIZATION.
17	ANARCHY IS OFTEN CONTRASTED WITH LAW, ORDER, OR SECURITY. BUT ANARCHIST SOCIETIES, BY WHICH I MEAN SOCIETIES THAT LACK A MONOPOLY OF COERCIVE FORCE, NEED NOT BE LAWLESS. THEY CAN DEVELOP SOPHISTICATED LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT REGULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR MEMBERS AND PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS. INTERNATIONAL LAW, MARKET ANARCHISM, AND OTHER MODELS OF ANARCHISM SUCH AS THE ONE PROPOSED BY CHANDRAN KUKATHAS ALREADY EXHIBIT OR COULD PLAUSIBLY EXHIBIT COMPLEX LEGAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS. I WILL SHOW THAT INSOFAR AS THESE MODELS RELY ON CONSENT, THEY ALL SHARE SIMILAR STRUCTURAL FLAWS, NAMELY, THAT THEY CANNOT MEET BASIC RULE-OF-LAW VALUES SUCH AS EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND ACCESS TO LEGAL REMEDIES FOR WRONGS THAT EMBODY AND RESPECT INDIVIDUAL MORAL EQUALITY, EVEN MINIMALLY CONCEIVED. THE IMPLICATION OF THIS ARGUMENT IS NOT TO VINDICATE STATE-BASED LEGAL SYSTEMS. RATHER IT IS TO SHOW THAT LEGAL SYSTEMS, STATE-BASED OR NOT, MUST HAVE A STRONG NONCONSENSUAL, COERCIVE ELEMENT: THE PROCESS OF MAKING, APPLYING, AND ENFORCING LAW MUST, TO SOME EXTENT, BE SEVERED FROM CONSENT IF LAW IS TO PERFORM ITS FUNCTION OF PROVIDING FOR MINIMAL JUSTICE.
18	THE WORLD BANK AND IMF ATTRIBUTE UNDERDEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA TO THE PRACTICE OF DIRECTING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THROUGH CENTRALIZED PLANNING. THEY PRESCRIBE PRIVATIZATION AND ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION TO RESTRUCTURE AFRICAN ECONOMIES, PROMOTE COMPETITION, REDUCE THE SCOPE FOR CORRUPTION, AND PROMOTE GOOD GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, INADEQUATE CHECKS ON POLITICAL POWER PERMIT AFRICAN ELITES TO SUBVERT THESE REFORMS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS A CASE STUDY OF SIERRA LEONE TO ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THE NEED FOR AN INTERNATIONAL AGENCY SUCH AS THE UN TO PROVIDE THE CAPACITY TO INVESTIGATE, EXPOSE AND CHECK CORRUPTION BY EMPLOYING UN INSPECTORS WHO ARE IMMUNE TO PRESSURE FROM POWERFUL AFRICAN ELITES. THIS TYPE OF CHECK ON CORRUPTION IS NECESSARY TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
19	SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE U.N. HAS PROVIDED A FORUM FOR THE ELABORATION AND PROMOTION OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL LIFE. IN THE CONTEXT OF CRIME PREVENTION AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE, SEVERAL STANDARDS, NORMS, AND GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN CREATED. PERHAPS THE MOST WIDELY STATED YET LEAST UNDERSTOOD GENERAL PRINCIPLE AT THE CORE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE HAS BEEN THE NOTION OF THE "RULE OF LAW." PERSONS, AGENCIES, AND GOVERNMENTS FROM DISPARATE REGIONAL, CULTURAL, AND LEGAL BACKGROUNDS SEEM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONCEPT POSITIVELY. INDEED, IT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS AN ESSENTIAL FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENT OF A JUST SOCIETY AND AS A PREREQUISITE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER FIRST ATTEMPTS TO CHART THE HISTORY OF THE "RULE OF LAW" IN TERMS OF ITS DEFINITION AND INTERNATIONAL PROMOTION. SECOND, IT OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE U.N. OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IS THEN DISCUSSED WITH A VIEW TO DETERMINING THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH AS TOOLS IN ASSISTING GOVERNMENTS WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING THAT THE U.N. DEVELOP A UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, POTENTIALLY A MORE EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR DEVELOPMENT.
20	THE LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF CHINA'S STATE GOVERNANCE IS "GOVERNING PARTY-CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCES-PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES-THE PEOPLE." THE "GOVERNING PARTY-CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCES" LINK IN THE CHAIN INVOLVES POLITICAL CONSULTATION THROUGH PEOPLE'S CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCES. THE "GOVERNING PARTY-CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCES-PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES" LINK INVOLVES A PROCESS OF OBTAINING LEGITIMACY FOR THE PARTY'S VIEWS BASED ON POLITICAL CONSULTATIONS WHICH ARE THEN TRANSLATED INTO THE NATIONAL WILL BY THE SYSTEM OF PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES. THE "PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES-THE PEOPLE" LINK INVOLVES THE TWO-PRONGED LOGIC OF ELECTIONS AND GOVERNING THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW. THE "GOVERNING PARTY-THE PEOPLE" LINK IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PARTY'S MASS LINE, WHICH ESSENTIALLY INVOLVES SOCIAL CONSULTATION. CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY USUALLY INCLUDES THE POLITICAL CONSULTATION IN THE "GOVERNING PARTY-CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCES" LINK AND THE SOCIAL CONSULTATION IN THE "GOVERNING PARTY-THE PEOPLE" LINK IN THE CHAIN, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE SYSTEM OF PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES. THIS LOGICALLY DETERMINES THE INNER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP, CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS FORM OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND SHAPES THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY. THAT IS, IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING, A CIRCULAR SYSTEM CONSISTING OF "POLITICAL CONSULTATION-LEGISLATIVE CONSULTATION-SOCIAL CONSULTATION" IS CREATED TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTUAL SYSTEM.
21	IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO, THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, CHERISHED FOR CENTURIES AS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE IN A DOMESTIC LEGAL CONTEXT, HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION FROM INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNITED NATIONS HAS DEVOTED SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT AND TIME TO STUDYING AND DEFINING THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION OF THE CONCEPT, TO CONCRETIZING SPECIFIC LEGAL CONSEQUENCES, AND TO APPLYING THE CONCEPT TO ITS OWN MANDATE AND WORK, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE PRESENT ARTICLE ENQUIRES INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS ADVANCED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE UN CHARTER. TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THE CONCEPT BE SAID TO BE INHERENT IN THE CHARTER, ALTHOUGH THE TERM ITSELF DOES NOT APPEAR IN ITS TEXT? COMPARING THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE CHARTER WITH THE RULE OF LAW AS DEVELOPED BY THE UN, THE ARTICLE OBSERVES A PROGRESSIVE EXPANSION OF THE CONCEPT IN SEVERAL DIMENSIONS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME ITS PERSISTENT VAGUENESS.
22	THE ARTICLE IS THE RESULT OF ORIGINAL RESEARCH AND COMPREHENSIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS, REGARDING IMPORTANT HISTORIOGRAPHICAL PUBLICATIONS AND REGULATIONS (MOSTLY THE CONSTITUTION), WHICH WERE ACCEPTED IN THE EARLY 1900S, IN PARTICULAR IN 1917-1919. THIS RESEARCH COVERS A PERIOD IN EUROPEAN HISTORY THAT INCLUDES THE EVENTS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR, REVOLUTIONS, COUPS D'ETAT, CIVIL WARS, WHICH IN THE HISTORY OF UKRAINE SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAME A PERIOD OF THE UKRAINIAN NATION-BUILDING ATTEMPTS. DURING THIS PERIOD, GENDER LEGISLATION WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN UKRAINE. IN OUR ARTICLE, AN AUTHOR PRESENTED A HISTORICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF GENDER LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE IN 1917-1919; AND AN ANALYSIS OF THE GENDER SITUATION IN UKRAINE IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL PROCESSES. ALSO, AN AUTHOR DETERMINED FEATURES OF JURIDICAL CONSOLIDATION OF GENDER EQUALITY FOR WOMEN AND MEN IN THIS PERIOD OF HISTORY. TO DEVELOP THE TOPIC, AN AUTHOR USED THE FOLLOWING SCIENTIFIC METHODS: HISTORICAL-SYSTEM METHOD; HISTORICAL-GENETIC METHOD; COMPARATIVE-HISTORICAL METHOD; CONTENT ANALYSIS; ANALYSIS-DISCOURSE. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE WAS A HISTORICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF GENDER LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE IN 1917-1919, AND IDENTIFICATION OF NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED THE PROCESS OF LEGAL CONSOLIDATION OF GENDER EQUALITY IN UKRAINE IN THIS PERIOD. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED THAT THE INCEPTION AND FORMATION OF THE NATIONAL IDEA OF GIVING WOMEN EQUAL RIGHTS WITH MEN IN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE DATED BACK TO THE MID-1850'S. SINCE THEN, IN UKRAINIAN LANDS, WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP WAS DEFINED AS A SOCIO-POLITICAL PHENOMENON. ALTHOUGH IN THE EARLY 1900'S, LEGISLATION IN THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN AND RUSSIAN EMPIRES ENSHRINED GENDER INEQUALITY AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. FROM THE MID-1900'S TO THE 1920S, THE FIRST WAVE OF FEMINISM' ACCOMPANIED THE POPULARIZATION OF LIBERAL IDEAS IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND IN PARTICULAR IN RUSSIA (WHICH AT THAT TIME INCLUDED THE DNIEPER UKRAINE). WHICH INDICATED THE AGGRAVATION OF THE WOMEN'S ISSUE DURING THAT PERIOD. CHANGES IN GEOPOLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE EARLY 1900 S (WORLD WAR I, THE COLLAPSE OF THE RUSSIAN AND AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN EMPIRES, THE REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS OF 1917 IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, ETC.) CONTRIBUTED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE GENDER LEGISLATION IN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. PARTICIPATION OF UKRAINIAN AND RUSSIAN WOMEN IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR AS OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BECOME A FACTOR IN THE BLURRING OF GENDER ROLES DURING WARTIME. AFTER THE FEBRUARY REVOLUTION, WOMEN'S REVOLUTIONARY-FEMINIST SENTIMENTS HAD REACHED THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF INCANDESCENCE. THE ACTIVE PUBLIC POSITION OF WOMEN FORCED THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA (ITS POSITIONS WERE PRECARIOUS AND NEEDED ELECTORAL SUPPORT) TO LOOK AT WOMEN AS ON THE SUBJECTS OF ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SUFFRAGE. ALL OF THIS CREATED THE GROUND FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION O F GENDER LEGISLATION. AS A RESULT, ON APRIL 15, 1917, UKRAINE, TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA, BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WOMEN WERE GIVEN SUFFRAGES. THE LEADERS AND IDEOLOGISTS OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC WENT FAR BEYOND THE IDEA OF GIVING WOMEN ONLY EQUAL SUFFRAGE. THEY DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF GENDER EQUALITY AND OFFICIALLY ENSHRINED THE EQUALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN CONCERNING ALL LEGAL RELATIONS ARISING IN THE STATE IN THE NORMS OF THE 1918 CONSTITUTION OF THE UPR (WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY, WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED). THEREFORE, UNLIKE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, IN APRIL 1918, UKRAINE BECAME ALMOST THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE AT THE INITIAL STAGE OF STATE FORMATION THE CONSTITUTION DECLARED THE EQUALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN FOR THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF RIGHTS. THIS WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENDER LEGISLATION OF THAT PERIOD. THIS IS EXPLAINED BOTH BY THE SPECIAL ATTITUDE TO WOMEN, WHICH WAS FORMING FOR A CERTAIN TIME IN UKRAINIAN SOCIETY, AND THE SOCIAL ORIENTATION OF IDEOLOGUES AND LEADERS OF THE CENTRAL COUNCIL OF THE UPR IN BUILDING A NEW NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF EQUAL IN ALL RIGHTS CITIZENS. THE DECISIVE FACTOR IN THIS PROCESS WAS THE ACTIVE PUBLIC POSITION OF WOMEN, WHICH CONFIRMED THE DESIRES AND NEEDS OF WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. THIS HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE PROCESS OF WOMEN'S EMANCIPATION AND HAD DESTROYED THE ESTABLISHED GENDER MODEL OF "DOMOBUD". HOWEVER THE DEFEAT OF THE UKRAINIAN STATE FORMATIONS (HETMANATE, OTAMANSH-CHINA, THE VICTORY OF THE BOLSHEVIK POWER IN DNIEPER UKRAINE) AND FURTHER CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL ACCENTS OF THE BOLSHEVIK GOVERNMENT FROM GENDER TO CLASS STRUGGLE, REFLECTED IN THE 1919 USSR CONSTITUTION INTERRUPTED THE LEGAL CONSOLIDATION OF WOMEN'S AND MEN EQUALITY. WOMEN OF WESTERN UKRAINE FIRST RECEIVED SUFFRAGE IN OCTOBER 1918 (CONSTITUTION OF THE WESTERN UKRAINIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC). THE 1919-1920 OCCUPATION OF WESTERN UKRAINIAN LANDS LED TO THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF GENDER LEGISLATION IN WESTERN UKRAINIAN LANDS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRIES THAT OCCUPIED THEM (CZECHOSLOVAKIA, POLAND, AND ROMANIA) BEFORE THE REUNIFICATION OF UKRAINIAN LANDS WITHIN THE USSR (1939-1945). THUS, FROM THE NORMS OF GENDER LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN UKRAINE IN 1917-1919, AT THAT TIME ONLY THE SUFFRAGE OF WOMEN WAS REALIZED. THE BEGINNING OF EQUAL RIGHTS JURIDICAL CONSOLIDATION FOR WOMEN AND MEN AROUND THE WORLD WAS DUE TO THE INTENSIFICATION OF LIBERAL AND FEMINIST MOVEMENTS, BUT IN UKRAINE ALSO DUE TO OF SOCIALIST AND OF UKRAINIAN NATIONAL POLITICAL MOVEMENT AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DOCTRINE "THE RULE OF LAW". WHICH WAS FURTHER DEVELOPED IN THE WORLD AND OVER TIME BECAME A BASIC PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC STATES, AND IN PARTICULAR UKRAINE.
23	THE EUROPEAN UNION VIEWS THE SPREAD OF ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND RULE OF LAW TO COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM DICTATORSHIP AS AMONG ITS PRIMARY GOALS WHEN CONSIDERING COUNTRIES AS CANDIDATES FOR MEMBERSHIP. EXISTING LITERATURE OFTEN SUGGESTS THAT EU MEMBERSHIP CONFERS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS ON THE ACCESSION COUNTRIES, AND THESE COUNTRIES ARE WILLING TO UNDERGO COSTLY AND DIFFICULT REFORMS TO REAP THESE BENEFITS. THROUGH STRICT MEMBERSHIP CONDITIONS, MEMBER STATES FORCE ACCESSION COUNTRIES TO COMMIT TO DEMOCRACY. DRAWING ON THEORETICAL WORK IN THE FIELDS OF LAW, POLITICS, AND ECONOMICS, THIS ARTICLE REASSESSES THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM. IT ARGUES THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE REFORMS REQUIRED OF WOULD-BE MEMBERS COULD HAVE THE PERVERSE EFFECT OF UNDERMINING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LEGITIMATE LAW IN TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRACIES. USING AN AGENT-BASED MODEL, THE ARTICLE ELUCIDATES A THEORY IN WHICH PLACING LAWS ON THE BOOKS AROUND WHICH NO SOCIETAL CONSENSUS EXISTS CAN CREATE PERVERSE INCENTIVES FOR CITIZENS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MAY LEAD TO AN EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
24	THE ARTICLE POSES THE QUESTION AND OFFERS SOME INDICATIONS OF HOW BEST TO SUPPORT THE ENHANCEMENT OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PLURAL LEGAL ENVIRONMENT IN SOMALILAND TODAY. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF SOME EXTERNALLY-SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO ENGAGE TRADITIONAL JUSTICE CONCEPTS AND ACTORS AND TO ENHANCE THE 'MODERN' JUSTICE SECTOR, THE QUESTION IS POSED WHETHER THE MEAGER RESULTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF EMBEDDED 'DEVELOPMENT' ASSUMPTIONS. WHERE RELEVANT PARTS OF SOCIETY ARE NOT WILLING TO EMBRACE WOMEN'S RIGHTS, NEITHER TRADITIONAL NOR FORMAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS WILL DELIVER. IF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE INTO THE WORLD OF THE OFTEN COMPLEX LOCAL POWER STRUCTURES AND POLITICAL ECONOMY THEY WOULD DETECT THAT SOCIAL NORMS ARE ONLY MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. SOMALILAND SHOWS LOCAL SOCIETIES AND CONCEPTS OVERRIDING AND CONDITIONING THE APPLICATION OF FORMAL LAWS WITH NO FIRM EVIDENCE THAT THE PREVAILING STATE AND JUDICIAL CENTRIC APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING CAN ACTUALLY TRANSLATE, IN THE SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM AT LEAST, INTO MORE JUSTICE FOR WOMEN AND POSITIVE SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGES AS A WHOLE. ATTENTION IS THEN CALLED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN'S OWN ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCY IN CHARTING A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY FORWARD AND TO THE NEED FOR MORE ENCOMPASSING APPROACHES TO SOCIAL CHANGE RATHER THAN NARROW JUSTICE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS.
25	THE TRADITIONAL PRIVATE, BIPOLAR MODEL OF CIVIL LITIGATION HAS COME UNDER STRAIN IN A WORLD OF MASS PRODUCTION AND EVEN MASS LAW. THE RESULT IS THAT THE COURTS ARE DECIDING THE SAME QUESTIONS OF FACT OR LAW IN MULTIPLE PROCEEDINGS. MULTIPLICITY CAUSES WASTE AND VEXATION, CREATES A RISK OF INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES AND RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION WHERE A COURT CREATES A PRECEDENT THAT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS NOT BEFORE THE COURT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MULTIPLICITY, AND THE RISK OF INCONSISTENCY THAT GOES WITH IT, IS ANTITHETICAL TO LEGAL PROCESS USING THEORETICAL ANALYSIS, INCLUDING RAWLS'S TRIPARTITE CLASSIFICATION OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE CONCEPTS, AND DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE. IT CONCLUDES BY EXAMINING DIFFERENT METHODS FOR AVOIDING INCONSISTENCY AND ARGUES FOR THE ADOPTION OF MANDATORY LEGAL PROCESS FOR ALL PERSONS WISHING TO ASSERT CLAIMS OR DEFENCES THAT GIVE RISE TO COMMON QUESTIONS.
26	THERE IS AN INCREASING TREND AMONG POLICY MAKERS AND TAX ADMINISTRATORS TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO TAX OFFSHORE TRUSTS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW THIS APPROACH MAY LEAD TO THE VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CASE OF AUSTRALIA AND CHINA. IN AUSTRALIA, SEVERAL COMPLEX RULES ARE ENACTED TO CLOSE THE 'GAPS' IN THE LAW. WHILE IN CHINA, THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT RULES TO ELABORATE THE VAGUE LAWS SURROUNDING TAXATION OF OFFSHORE TRUSTS. THIS ARTICLE WILL DISSECT WHAT A TRUST IS AND HOW THE RULES WORK IN PRACTICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS VIOLATED IN THESE JURISDICTIONS.
27	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CCP'S 'FALUN GONG PROBLEM" WITH REFERENCE TO PRC LAW AND POLICY ON "HERETICAL CULTS," PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PROBLEM FOR THE ONGOING STRUGGLE TO ESTABLISH HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. OFFICIAL PRC COMMENTARY CONTENDS THAT THE FALUN GONG NOT ONLY COMMITTED CRIMINAL ACTS BUT ALSO WILFULLY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW ITSELF. HUMAN RIGHTS CRITICS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE US COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, HAVE, ON THE OTHER HAND, ATTACKED THE PRC FOR A "REPRESSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK" THAT THREATENS HUMAN RIGHTS. THE "ALUN GONG PROBLEM" IS AN IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE LAW HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRANSCEND THE CONCEPTUAL BIAS OF PAST CRIMINAL LAW ON COUNTER-REVOLUTION. THE RELATED POLITICIZATION OF THE LAW THROUGH A REVIVED PRINCIPLE OF "FLEXIBILITY" CHALLENGES THE INTERNAL PROCESS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND THE RECENT REFORM FOCUS ON THE BALANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND PUBLIC ORDER.
28	UNDER MOHUK, THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF A FOREIGN COURT IN TURKISH LAW DO NOT INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE DECISION BE LOYAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. WHEREAS, IF A FOREIGN JUDGEMENT INFRINGES ON THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW OF THE STATE, THEN THE ENFORCEMENT REQUEST WILL BE REJECTED DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF PUBLIC POLICY. THE COURT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A PART OF RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. ALTHOUGH, TURKISH PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW (PIL) ACT NO 5718 ARTICLE 50 CONSIDERS ONLY FOREIGN COURT DECISIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT, THE DEFINITION OF A COURT IS NOT REGULATED IN THIS ACT WHEREAS IT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR CONSIDERATION. THE PROCESS OF A FOREIGN COURT JUDGEMENT SEEKING ENFORCEMENT IN TURKISH LAW SHOULD NOT INFRINGE THE RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL AND ALSO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF TURKISH PROCEDURAL LAW. FOR THAT REASON, THE JUDGMENT PROCESS OF THE FOREIGN COURT SHOULD ALSO BE CONFORM TO THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW. IN THIS STUDY, THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF DECISIONS RENDERED BY A MEDIATOR IS ALSO EXAMINED FROM THE POINT OF ENDING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN PARTS AS FINAL. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN PAYMENT ORDERS ARE DISCUSSED IN A PERSPECTIVE WHETHER THEY WERE BEING AS A COURT DECISION AND ALSO WHETHER THEY WERE CONSIDERED AS AN AWARD OR NOT.
29	AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE HAS EMERGED RECENTLY THAT INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) IN DEVELOPING REGIONS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING LATIN AMERICA. MUCH OF THIS WORK HAS FOCUSED ON WHETHER AUTHORITARIAN OR DEMOCRATIC RULE IS BETTER FOR ATTRACTING FDI. CURIOUSLY, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO UNPACKING REGIME TYPE TO SEE WHETHER SPECIFIC POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES RELATED TO JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT FDI DETERMINANTS. BASED ON PANEL DATA ANALYSIS AND OUR OWN SURVEY OF US CORPORATIONS, WE FIND THAT JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF FDI IN LATIN AMERICA.
30	THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND CONCEPTUALIZES THE STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE PARTY-STATE AND PROPOSES A "DUAL NORMATIVE SYSTEM" AS A FRAMEWORK TO INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY OF CHINA. THIS FRAMEWORK HAS FOUR COMPONENTS: (1) STRUCTURAL INTEGRATION OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP OR THE PARTY) AND THE STATE; (2) RESERVED DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO THE STATE; (3) BIFURCATION OF STATE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES; AND (4) COHABITATION OF THE TWO NORMATIVE SYSTEMS: ONE OF THE PARTY AND ONE OF THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE POLITICAL REFORMS IN CHINA SINCE THE 1980S HAVE NOT SEPARATED THE POWER OF THE PARTY AND THE STATE, BUT HAVE CREATED AN INCREASINGLY INSTITUTIONALIZED DUAL NORMATIVE SYSTEM THAT IS MORE COMPLEX COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS FUSED SYSTEM, YET MORE PLIABLE TO ADJUSTMENTS AND MORE OPEN TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS, INCLUDING TO THAT OF THE "PARTY-STATE CONSTITUTIONALISM", WHICH INTERPRETS THE "DRULE OF LAW" AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF THE PARTY.
31	AS CRIME RATES RISE, DOES PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW WANE? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CITIZENS' REACTIONS TO THE CURRENT CRIME EPIDEMIC IN CENTRAL AMERICA. AN ANALYSIS OF SURVEY DATA GAUGES THE IMPACT OF CRIME AND INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE ON CITIZEN SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT CRIME HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ERODE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE LAW, BUT THE LINKAGE IS MEDIATED BY NATIONAL CONTEXT.
32	HONG KONG CITIZENS IN 1995 CHOSE THE MOST DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE IN THEIR 150-YEAR HISTORY, YET CHINESE LEADERS INSIST THE ELECTION WAS ''UNFAIR AND UNREASONABLE'' AND DID ''NOT TRULY REFLECT THE WILL OF THE HONG KONG PEOPLE.'' THEY HAVE VOWED TO ABOLISH THAT LEGISLATURE IMMEDIATELY UPON ASSUMPTION OF SOVEREIGNTY IN 1997. BRITAIN HAS CONCEDED ALL MAJOR POINTS TO CHINA AND HAS AGREED TO POSTPONE THE CREATION OF THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL UNTIL 1997. THERE IS CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT CHINA HAS NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS HONG KONG'S GREATEST LEGACY AND WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO ITS EXISTENCE AND TO ITS DYNAMIC ECONOMY. ITS ATTACK ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS A MAJOR THREAT. THERE ARE ENLIGHTENED VOICES WITHIN CHINA'S LEADERSHIP. THEY MUST PREVAIL IF HONG KONG IS TO SURVIVE.
33	FROM A LATIN-AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE, EVEN IN A CONTEXT WHERE THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK OR HAS BEEN VERY WEAK, THE ROLE OF HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS HAS BEEN AND IS VERY RELEVANT IN TERMS OF DOCUMENTING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND SEEKING AND BRINGING JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THOSE VIOLATIONS, AS WELL AS ACTING AS A GUARDIAN ANGEL TO THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM. THE ROLE OF NGOS WITHIN THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFIC POLITICAL AND THE LEGAL-NORMATIVE CONTEXT ON THE CONTINENT. INDEED, THE ROLE PLAYED BY HUMAN RIGHTS NGOS IN THE AMERICAS HAS RESPONDED/RESPONDS TO THE POLITICAL REALITY OF REPRESSIVE REGIMES AND PRESENT-DAY FRAGILE DEMOCRACIES STRUGGLING TO UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. FURTHERMORE, THE LEGAL-NORMATIVE CONTEXT, I.E. THE AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTERPRETATION GIVEN BY THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO ITS PROVISIONS, HAS ALSO GIVEN AND GIVES NGOS AMPLE SPACE TO INTERACT THROUGH DIFFERENT METHODS AND STRATEGIES IN A LESS ACTIVE TO A VERY ACTIVE MANNER WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING BODIES FROM 1959 ON.
34	MAKING THE AUTHORITY OF OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS MORE STANDARDIZED AND LAW-BASED IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE PROCESS OF DEEPENING FINANCIAL REFORM AND ESTABLISHING FISCAL AND TAXATION SYSTEMS GOVERNED BY LAW. TO DO SO, CHINA NEEDS TO CLARIFY FURTHER THE LEGAL DIVISION OF AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL AND PROTECT AND PROMOTE ITS EXERCISE THROUGH LEGAL MECHANISMS. GOVERNMENTS ARE GIVEN POWERS SO THAT THEY MAY EFFECTIVELY PROTECT CITIZENS' BASIC INTERESTS. ON THE PREMISE OF CLARIFYING THE BOUNDARIES OF GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, WE SHOULD USE LEGAL MEANS AND OBSERVE THE PRINCIPLE OF RESTRAINT IN DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY OF OFFICE. THE CRITERIA FOR THE DIVISION HAVE BOTH ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ASPECTS. ECONOMIC CRITERIA ARE MORE BASIC; LEGAL CRITERIA MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PATTERN OF DIVISION DERIVED FROM ECONOMIC CRITERIA. THE AUTHORITY OF OFFICE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO LEGISLATIVE SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT. THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM ALLOCATES POWERS OF LEGISLATIVE SUPERVISION QUITE RATIONALLY, BUT SUPERVISION OF JUDICIAL POWERS IN PARTICULAR SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY CENTRALIZED. IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT, SOME SPACE IS LEFT FOR THE DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM, AND THERE IS QUITE OBVIOUS HOMOGENEITY OF POWERS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THE LEGAL DIVISION OF AUTHORITY OF OFFICE REQUIRES THAT BASIC PRINCIPLES BE STIPULATED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT A BASIC FISCAL LAW BE DEVISED THAT CLARIFIES THE POWERS OF ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. ALLOCATION OF FISCAL POWERS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE TRANSFER PAYMENT SYSTEM, TOGETHER WITH BUDGET CONSTRAINTS, WILL PROVIDE AN INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE FOR THE DIVISION OF THESE POWERS. FUNDAMENTALLY, THE LEGAL CONFIRMATION OF A SYSTEM OF CIVIL RIGHTS CAN PROMOTE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATUTORY POWERS.
35	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO READ CLOSELY THE TANNAITIC MATERIAL PERTAINING TO JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND LEGAL JUSTICE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RABBIS ARE NOT SIMPLY CLARIFYING CERTAIN SPECIALIZED QUESTIONS ABOUT COURTROOM PROCEDURE BUT ARE SERIOUSLY ENGAGING A CORE FACET OF ROMAN IMPERIAL AND HELLENISTIC IDEOLOGY: THE BENEFITS AND DEFICITS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT AS OPPOSED TO LATER, TALMUDIC RABBIS, THE TANAAIM ARE PARTICULARLY STRICT WITH REGARD TO PERSONAL, JUDICIAL DISCRETION - IN OTHER WORDS, THAT RATHER THAN STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN LAW AND WISDOM, THEY ALLOW ONLY FOR RULE-BASED DECISION MAKING. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE TANAAIM NOT ONLY OPT FOR RULE-BOUND DECISION MAKING, BUT THAT THEY DO SO WITH A FULL AWARENESS OF WHAT IS LOST FROM BROADER IDEALS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE WHEN JUDGES ARE REQUIRED TO ABIDE, ALMOST MECHANICALLY, BY THE RULES. THE TANAAIM THEREBY CONTRIBUTED TO CONTEMPORARY QUESTIONS IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF DISEMPOWERED ROMAN PROVINCIALS FOR WHOM THE RULE OF LAW MEANT LESS AS POLITICAL PROPAGANDA AND MORE AS A MEASURE OF STABILITY IN UNCERTAIN TIMES.
36	A COMMON POSITION ADOPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS THAT ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AFTER VIOLENT INTERNAL CONFLICT IS AN ESSENTIAL PREREQUISITE IN THE TRANSITION FROM WAR TO PEACE. IN PRACTICAL TERMS, THIS OFTEN TRANSLATES INTO PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMES DIRECTED AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR. RARELY IS RULE OF LAW ACKNOWLEDGED IN RELATION TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. THIS HAS SEVERAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY IN SOCIETIES WHERE PUBLIC MISMANAGEMENT, BAD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION RUN HIGH, AND ESPECIALLY IF ONE CONSIDERS THESE ISSUES AS CONSTITUTING A LARGE PART OF THE REASON FOR STATE 'FAILURE'. BUT, A NEW TREND IS NOW VAGUELY DISCERNIBLE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ACTORS INVOLVED IN REBUILDING WAR-SHATTERED SOCIETIES THAT GIVES PRIORITY TO THE RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM. LIBERIA PROVIDES, IN THIS REGARD, AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE THROUGH THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TRANSITIONAL NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA AND DONOR AGENCIES, WHERE INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS WILL HAVE CO-SIGNING AUTHORITY OVER A NUMBER OF BUDGETARY ISSUES, AND WHERE NATIONAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL BE STRENGTHENED IN ORDER TO COMBAT ARBITRARY GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION.
37	I DEVELOP A THEORY OF SPATIAL DIFFUSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHERE "SPACE" IS CONCEPTUALIZED AS SHARED MEMBERSHIPS IN ECONOMIC INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS). I ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW DIFFUSES AS A RESULT OF ECONOMIC COMPETITION AND SOCIALIZATION. OUTSIDE EVALUATORS, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL LEADERS, ACTIVISTS, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, INTERNATIONAL FIRMS AND INVESTORS, OFTEN ASSESS STATES' ATTRACTIVENESS AS A BUSINESS VENUE BY COMPARING THEM TO SIMILAR STATES. THE NATURAL REFERENCE GROUP FOR SUCH COMPARISONS IS NOT JUST GEOGRAPHICAL NEIGHBORS, BUT ALSO STATES WITH SHARED MEMBERSHIPS IN ECONOMIC IOS. RESPONDING TO THIS EVALUATION, STATES IDENTIFY MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN REFERENCE GROUPS AND VIEW THEM AS COMPETITION FOR INVESTMENT. AS A RESULT, STATES WITHIN THE SAME REFERENCE GROUPS CONVERGE ON ISSUES RELATED TO LOWERING DOMESTIC ECONOMIC RISKS, WHICH ARE REFERRED TO BY THE UMBRELLA TERM "DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW." THE RESULTING PROCESS OF POLICY CONVERGENCE IS FURTHER AIDED BY SOCIALIZATION. SOCIALIZATION MAY INVOLVE EMULATION OF POLICIES OF SIMILAR STATES OR "ACTIVE" LEARNING THROUGH NORM ENTREPRENEURS, WHO USE THE REFERENCE GROUPS FOR BOTH EVALUATION AND ACCESS TO THEIR TARGET AUDIENCES. I CAPTURE THE THEORIZED SPATIAL PROCESSES USING A MULTIPARAMETRIC SPATIOTEMPORAL AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL (M-STAR) AND FIND SUPPORT FOR THE PREDICTION.
38	IN A REPORT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN AUGUST 2004 THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL SAID THAT THE RULE OF LAW' IS A CONCEPT AT THE VERY HEART OF THE UN'S MISSION. IN SEPTEMBER 2015 THE UN AGREED A SET OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (STGS) FOR 2015-30, WHICH CAME INTO FORCE ON 1 JANUARY 2016. GOAL 16.3 OF THE SDGS ENSHRINES A COMMITMENT BY ALL UN MEMBERS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, AND TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL'. IN MARCH 2016 THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW, KNOWN AS THE VENICE COMMISSION, PUBLISHED A REPORT WHICH SAID THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONCEPT OF UNIVERSAL VALIDITY. IT OBSERVED THAT IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES STATES REFER TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS. THE RULE OF LAW IS EXPRESSLY MENTIONED IN A UNITED KINGDOM STATUTE: SECTION 1 OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM ACT 2005 SAYS THAT THE ACT DOES NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE STATUTE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW; NOR DOES ANY OTHER UK STATUTE. THERE IS NO LEGALLY BINDING DEFINITION ANYWHERE.
39	IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM, WHICH HAS EXTENSIVE CONTENT, TO BUILD SOCIALISTIC POLITICAL CIVILIZATION. SOCIALISTIC POLITICAL CIVILIZATION INCLUDES LOTS OF ASPECTS, SUCH AS POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS CIVILIZATION, POLITICAL SYSTEM CIVILIZATION, POLITICAL BEHAVIOR CIVILIZATION AND CIVILIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. COMRADE JIAN ZEMIN POINTS OUT, THE RULE OF LAW BELONGS TO THE CATEGORY OF POLITICAL CONSTRUCTION; IT IS ONE OF THE CONTENT OF POLITICAL CIVILIZATION. DURING THE NEW HISTORICAL ERA OF BUILDING THE WELL-TO-DO SOCIETY IN AN ALL-ROUND WAY, TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND TO BUILD THE SOCIALIST COUNTRY RUNNING BY LAW IS NOT ONLY THE IMPORTANT CONTENT AND SYMBOL OF SOCIALISTIC POLITICAL CIVILIZATION, BUT ALSO THE NECESSARY INSURANCE AND WAY TO BUILD IT. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDY ON THE MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING PROBLEMS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BY THE RULE OF LAW WITH TRIANGULAR FUZZY INFORMATION. THEN, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TRIANGULAR FUZZY HAMACHER CORRELATED GEOMETRIC (TFHCG) OPERATOR. WE HAVE EXPLOITED THE TFHCG OPERATOR TO MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE DECISION MAKING TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BY THE RULE OF LAW WITH TRIANGULAR FUZZY INFORMATION. IN THE END, AN EXAMPLE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BY THE RULE OF LAW WITH TRIANGULAR FUZZY INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH.
40	THIS CONTRIBUTION DISCUSSES HOW THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) ADAPTED TO THE WORKING CONDITIONS UNDER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WHILE RESPECTING THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. THE ARTICLE FIRST EXAMINES WHAT THE RULE OF LAW MEANS IN THE UN CONTEXT. ON THIS BASIS, THE ARTICLE THEN CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENT COVID-19-RELATED EMERGENCY MEASURES TAKEN BY THE UN WITH A FOCUS ON FOUR OF THE UN PRINCIPAL ORGANS: THE SECRETARIAT, THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AND THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE. OVERALL, THE UN HAS SUCCEEDED IN MAINTAINING PUBLIC TRUST, INCLUDING THE TRUST OF ITS MEMBER STATES, IN RESPONDING TO AND RECOVERING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BECAUSE IT CONTINUED TO RESPECT STANDARDS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW DURING THE PANDEMIC. MOREOVER, THE UN HAS LEARNED IMPORTANT LESSONS THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO ADAPT EVEN BETTER TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES.
41	NATIONAL CONTACT POINTS (NCPS), WHICH SUPPORT THE OECD GUIDELINES FOR MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES, ARE OFTEN INVOKED AS A RELIABLE STATE-BASED MECHANISM FOR HOLDING TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR BUSINESS-RELATED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SCRUTINIZE THE ABILITY OF NCPS TO OFFER EFFECTIVE REMEDY THROUGH THE LENS OF AN OFTEN-QUOTED SUCCESS STORY (THE CASE OF THE POST-COLONIAL BREWERY BRALIMA-HEINEKEN AT THE DUTCH NCP) AND THROUGH A FEW EXISTING STUDIES THAT EXAMINE FACTORS THAT CURTAIL OR ENHANCE THE POSSIBILITY OF NCP MECHANISMS TO DELIVER EFFECTIVE REMEDY. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST SPECIFIC 'ACTIONS FOR EFFECTIVENESS' IN THE FORM OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING NCPS AS A TOOL TO DELIVER EFFECTIVE REMEDY. ZOOMING OUT, WE EXTEND SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON HOW OUR FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE THAT NCPS ARE EXPRESSIONS OF A LARGER SYSTEMIC PROBLEM SURROUNDING THE ROLE OF LAW WITHIN MARKET GLOBALIZATION AND THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION ON THE MAKING OF NORMS, CHANGING LEGAL AUTHORITY AND BASIC FAIRNESS UNDER CONDITIONS OF STARK POWER IMBALANCE. SUPPORTING THIS APPROACH ARE HISTORICAL FACTORS WHICH MAKE THE OECD GUIDELINES AND NCPS RIPE FOR SUCH CONCEPTUALIZATION.
42	ONCE A RARELY DISCUSSED ISSUE, CORRUPTION HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DEBATED PROBLEMS IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIZATION. FOR POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, CORRUPTION HAS REPRESENTED A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE, UNDERMINING THEIR PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A TRADITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF DEMOCRACY, THERE IS PROMISE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION WHEN THERE IS POLITICAL WILL TO COMBAT IT. THE CASE OF ROMANIA DEMONSTRATES THAT EUROPEAN UNION (EU) PRESSURE, ELECTORAL PRESSURE AND THE POLITICAL WILL OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL LEADERSHIP COMBINED TO SECURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND COMBATING CORRUPTION IN THE ROMANIAN JUDICIARY BETWEEN 1997 AND 2006.
43	UNTIL RECENTLY, THE CONCEPT OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' (ROL) WAS EXCLUSIVELY USED IN RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER OF THE STATE. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, HOWEVER, IT HAS ENTERED THE VOCABULARY OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARS AND EXPERTS. THIS JOURNEY OF ROL FROM THE DOMESTIC TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE HAS PROVOKED FIERCE DEBATES BETWEEN PRACTITIONERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, NOTABLY BECAUSE, FAR FROM BEING A MERE DOCTRINAL CONTROVERSY, IT GAVE RISE TO PRACTICES IMPINGING ON THE EXERCISE OF POWER AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND ENABLING DIVERSE INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO INTERFERE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF TARGET STATES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IN A SOMEWHAT PARADOXICAL WAY, THESE DEVELOPMENTS IMPAIR THE CONCEPT OF ROL RATHER THAN EXPANDING IT INTO NEW DOMAINS. INDEED, WHILE THE ESTABLISHED CONCEPT OF ROL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT PRESUPPOSED THE PRINCIPLES OF SOVEREIGNTY AND NON-INTERVENTION, CURRENT REFORMULATIONS OF ROL WEAKEN THEM WHILE MAKING NEW INTERVENTIONIST PRACTICES EASIER. ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL RATIONALIZATIONS USED IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY EU AND UN CRISIS MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS MAKES THIS CLEAR. DRAWING ON INSIGHTS GAINED FROM LEGAL THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE CONCEPT OF ROL CANNOT SIMPLY BE TRANSPOSED INTO THE 'INTERNATIONAL' REALM WITHOUT HAMPERING ITS INTERNAL COHERENCE.
44	JOHN LOCKE PRESENTS SELF-DEFENSE IN A WAY SIMILAR TO AMERICAN STAND YOUR GROUND LAWS: LETHAL RETRIBUTION IN THE NAME OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. INTERROGATING A COMMON LAW DISTINCTION-JUSTIFIABLE VERSUS EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE-HIGHLIGHTS HOW LOCKE SUPPORTS BOTH (1) A LAW OF NATURE GROUNDED IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND ACHIEVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT AND ACTION (JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE) AND (2) A RULE OF LAW FOUNDED ON COLLECTIVE FREEDOM AND EQUALITY AND ACTUALIZED THROUGH EXTERNAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROCEDURES REMOVED FROM INDIVIDUAL CONTROL (EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE). ALTHOUGH LOCKE'S RADICAL VERSION OF JUSTIFIED HOMICIDE INSUFFICIENTLY CONSIDERS HOW BIAS AND SELF-INTEREST DISTORT JUDGMENT AND UNDERCUT THE RULE OF LAW, EXCUSABLE HOMICIDE'S REQUIREMENT OF RETREAT MIGHT AMELIORATE SEVERAL EFFECTS OF BIAS. THIS ANALYSIS OF LETHAL SELF-DEFENSE IMPROVES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LOCKE'S POLITICAL THOUGHT AND PROVIDES A LENS FOR ASSESSING CURRENT CONTROVERSIES OVER STAND YOUR GROUND THAT HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR LIBERAL GOVERNMENT.
45	NOTWITHSTANDING THE WELL-KNOWN DIFFERENCES THAT RUN THROUGH CULTURES AND TRADITIONS, THE WEST HAS NEVER STOPPED TRYING TO EXPORT ITS OWN LAW INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD. DURING AND AFTER THE COLONIAL ERA SIMILAR ENDEAVORS WERE SPREADING WESTERN VIEWS ON HOW LEGAL ISSUES ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND HANDLED, THEREBY BROADENING THE WEST'S AREA OF INFLUENCE ON GLOBAL LEGAL AFFAIRS. MORE RECENTLY, THESE EFFORTS HAVE OVERLAPPED WITH (AND HAVE BEEN BLURRED BY THE RHETORICAL VEIL OF) SO-CALLED LEGAL GLOBALIZATION. THE FOCUS OF THIS ARTICLE IS ON THE ATTITUDES AND METHODS UNDERPINNING THE ONGOING WESTERN ATTEMPTS TO TRANSPLANT THE TWO PILLARS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, I.E., DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, INTO OUTSIDE CONTEXTS. CONFRONTED WITH PROCESSES THAT CONCERN DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEMS, THIS ARTICLE CANNOT BUT TAKE A COMPARATIVE LAW APPROACH. SUCH AN APPROACH ENTAILS A CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS AND WILL ENABLE AN ANALYSIS OF DATA THAT ARE USUALLY EITHER DISCARDED OR UNDERRATED IN MAINSTREAM LEGAL DEBATES. THUS NOTIONS, IDEAS, AND DEBATES ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY WILL BE REAPPRAISED FROM A COMPARATIVE LAW POINT OF VIEW IN ORDER TO BOTH UNEARTH THEIR INTIMATE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS AND TO SCRUTINIZE THEIR POTENTIAL FOR BEING TRANSPLANTED OUTSIDE WESTERN SOCIETIES. THE ANALYSIS WILL SHOW HOW THIS POTENTIAL, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT EXISTS, CAN ONLY BE EXPLOITED THROUGH A RADICAL SHIFT FROM THE USUAL WAY IN WHICH THE WEST APPROACHES THE LEGAL SETTINGS IT AIMS TO CHANGE.
46	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE REFERS TO JUDGEMENTS MADE ON THE BASIS OF FACTS AND IN THE LIGHT OF THE LAW. JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE LIES IN MAKING SURE THAT JUDGES ARE NOT INFLUENCED BY ANY OUTSIDE PARTY OR THE JUDGE'S OWN PERSONAL INTERESTS, NOR BY ANY FEAR OF DEFAMATION OR THREATS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE VIETNAMESE JUDICIARY UNDERSTANDS ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT CITIZENS AGAINST UNLAWFUL ACTS OF GOVERNMENT, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE PILLARS OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE STUDY USED A HISTORICAL AND ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE THE DATA COLLECTED FROM PROCURATORS, LEGAL ARCHIVES AND LIBRARIES. DURING THE DATA COLLECTION, THE FOCUS WAS ON THE VIETNAMESE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER RELATED ACTS. THE STUDY CAME ACROSS A LOT OF LIMITATIONS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS JUDICIAL REFORMS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE WINGS OF THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALWAYS GO TOGETHER. THE STUDY ALSO SUGGESTED THAT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE SHOULD BE SEEN AS THE DEMAND OF SOCIETY AND THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE SHOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS.
47	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE THEORETICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND ABOUT ITS DEFINITION BY LOOKING AT SITUATIONS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS PUT TO THE TEST - STATES OF EMERGENCY. STATES OF EMERGENCY AND LAWS OF EXCEPTION HAVE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, ONE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC BEING THAT LEGISLATIVE POWER IS SHIFTED TO THE EXECUTIVE - IN OTHER WORDS, DEMOCRACIES BECOME LESS DEMOCRATIC. BY ANALYSING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NATURE OF EMERGENCIES AND THE STRUCTURE OF STATES OF EMERGENCY, THEIR INTERCONNECTION WILL BECOME MORE TRANSPARENT. IT WILL LOGICALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT RULES REGARDING STATES OF EXCEPTION CONCERN ONLY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES AND THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS TO CONTINUE ITS RULE ALSO WITHIN TIMES OF CRISIS. I WILL ARGUE THAT THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT A CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW ONLY WORKS IN DEMOCRACIES AND IS THEREFORE INAPPLICABLE TO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. HAVING ESTABLISHED THAT, THIS ARTICLE ADDS TO THE LEGAL-THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULES OF EMERGENCY POWERS BY ELABORATING THEM ON THE BASIS OF THE CONCEPTS DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS.
48	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THERE IS AN ASCENDING CONSENSUS THAT THE EUROPEAN MIDDLE AGES WERE PERVADED BY A NUMBER OF CONSTITUTIONALIST NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT FACILITATED THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY, THE MODERN STATE, AND THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE REVIEW OF THIS LITERATURE ALSO SHOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE ATTEMPT TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLAIN THE ORIGINS OF THESE NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHAT SO FAR SEEMS TO BE THE MAJOR "ORIGINS'' HYPOTHESIS, NAMELY, THAT THESE NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS WERE A CONTINGENT PRODUCT OF THE SECULAR-RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS IN THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES, REINFORCED BY THE REDISCOVERY OF ROMAN LAW AND THE POLITICAL THEORY OF ARISTOTLE. THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH AN ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS, WHICH TRACES THESE DEVELOPMENTS FROM LATENT TENSIONS BETWEEN CHURCH AND RULERS ALREADY PRESENT IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES, AND AN ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE TWO POSITIONS IS MADE. THE DISCUSSION DRAWS IN EVIDENCE FROM WESTERN EUROPE AND THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE IN BOTH THE EARLY AND HIGH MIDDLE AGES. TO THAT CONFLICT OF FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WE OWE THE RISE OF CIVIL LIBERTY. IF THE CHURCH HAD CONTINUED TO BUTTRESS THE THRONES OF THE KING WHOM IT ANOINTED, OR IF THE STRUGGLE HAD TERMINATED SPEEDILY IN AN UNDIVIDED VICTORY, ALL EUROPE WOULD HAVE SUNK DOWN UNDER A BYZANTINE OR MUSCOVITE DESPOTISM. FOR THE AIM OF BOTH CONTENDING PARTIES WAS ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY. BUT ALTHOUGH LIBERTY WAS NOT THE END FOR WHICH THEY STROVE, IT WAS THE MEANS BY WHICH THE TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL POWER CALLED THE NATIONS TO THEIR AID. LORD ACTON
49	THE ADOPTION OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY INSTITUTIONS HAS BECOME A CRUCIAL ASPECT OF RULE OF LAW PROJECTS WORLDWIDE. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS (NHRIS) IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE PROCESS BY WHICH SUCH LEGAL MODELS AND IDEAS ARE ADOPTED AND BORROWED FROM GLOBAL ACTORS, AND THE RELIANCE ON REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL NETWORKS. THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF INDONESIA AND MYANMAR, IT EXAMINES SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS AND SOURCES OF 'ASIAN LEGAL TRANSPLANTS', PARTICULARLY THE ROLE OF REGIONAL NETWORKS AS SOURCES OF LEGITIMACY. IT ARGUES THAT THE SUB-REGIONAL NHRI NETWORK IN SOUTHEAST ASIA HAS EVOLVED AS AN ALTERNATIVE SITE OF LEGITIMACY, AND THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH A NHRI IN SOUTHEAST ASIA MAY RELY ON IT DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THE REGIME IT OPERATES UNDER, BUT ALSO ON THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE NHRI WITHIN THE REGIONAL NETWORK.
50	THE THIRD MILLENIUM WILL BE A DEFINING PERIOD FOR THE FUTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS WORLDWIDE. IN THE SECOND MILLENIUM, RUDIMENTARY CONCEPTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS EMERGED, EVOLVED, EXPANDED AND ULTIMATELY WERE WOVEN INTO AN INTRICATE AND DETAILED WEB OF RIGHTS THAT HAS BEEN GLOBALLY ENUNCIATED, BUT NOT YET UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AND ENFORCED. SINCE WORLD WAR II, DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OCCURRED AT AN ESCALATING PACE. THE UN AND THE WORLD COURT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS HAVE BEEN CREATED, AND REGIONAL COURTS AND REGIONAL SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED. THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION THAT RULERS OF NATIONS MUST BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. AT THE CLOSE OF THE SECOND MILLENIUM WE ARE WITNESSING THE FIRST EVER INDICTMENT OF A SITTING RULER FOR VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW. DESPITE IMPORTANT PROGRESS, MANY OBSTACLES MUST BE OVERCOME BEFORE THE RULE OF LAW WILL PREVAIL GLOBALLY. (C) 1999 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
51	BORROWING LAWS AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER IS USED AS A WAY TO IMPROVE A LEGAL SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM IS THAT TRANSPLANTING FOREIGN LAWS OR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS DOES NOT TAKE PLACE IN A LEGAL CULTURAL VACUUM. TRANSPLANTING DIFFICULTIES ARE OBVIOUS WHEN BORROWING TAKES PLACE IN THE FORM OF WHOLESALE ABSORPTION, BUT EVEN SELECTIVE BORROWING HAS ITS OWN OBSTACLES. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SO-CALLED PATH DEPENDENCE FOR LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION. THE AIM IS TO HIGHLIGHT TRANSPLANTATION DIFFICULTIES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF LEGAL HISTORY. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PATH DEPENDENCE IS ADDRESSED AS A WAY OF ILLUSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LAW'S PAST TO THE TRANSPLANTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A FORMALIST AND A SUBSTANTIVE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND IT DISCUSSES TWO ILLUSTRATIVE CASES: CHINA AND POLAND.
52	THE EXPRESSION "RULE OF LAW" IS MULTIFACETED AND ENTAILS A COMPLEX NETWORK OF CONCEPTS. ALTHOUGH THE EXPRESSION IS USED FREQUENTLY, ITS INTENDED MEANING IS OFTEN CONNECTED TO THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT IS INVOKED. AS THE RULE OF LAW IS SO OFTEN USED IN A CONTEXTUAL MANNER, ITS CONCEPTUAL UNDERPINNINGS ARE OFTEN ONLY PARTIALLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE HISTORICITY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ANALYZES THE CONCEPTS CONTAINED WITHIN THE EXPRESSION IN ORDER TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION OF THEIR MEANING, IMPORTANCE, AND IMPLICATIONS. A THEME PERSISTING THROUGHOUT THE ARTICLE IS THAT OF THE THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW, BOTH IN GENERAL AND IN OUR CANADIAN CONTEXT. AN IMPORTANCE OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT THE AUTHOR, HAVING PROVIDED THE READER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ALSO PROVIDES THE READER WITH THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE, DISCERN, AND BE VIGILANT AGAINST THE THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE IS PART I OF A TWO-PART SERIES.
53	THIS PAPER USES THE CONCEPT OF THE "RULE OF LAW" TO COMPARE QING CHINA AND BRITISH INDIA. RATHER THAN USING THE RULE OF LAIC INSTRUMENTALLY, THE PAPER EMBEDS IT IN THE HISTORIES OF STATE POWER AND SOVEREIGNTY IN CHINA AND INDIA. THREE THEMES, ALL FRAMED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF MAN AS OPPOSITIONAL YET PARADOXICALLY INTERTWINED NOTIONS, ORGANIZE THE PAPERS COMPARISONS: THE ROLE OF A DISCOURSE OF LAIC IN SIMULTANEOUSLY LEGITIMIZING AND CONSTRAINING THE POLITICAL AUTHORITY IF THE STATE; THE ROLE OF LAIC AND LEGAL PROCEDURES IN SHAPING AND DEFINING SOCIETY; AND THE ROLE OF LAIC IN DEFINING AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ORDER BASED OIL CONTRACT, PROPERTY, AND RIGHTS. A FOURTH SECTION CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGIS FOR THE HISTORICAL TRAJECTORIES OF CHINA AND INDIA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. TAKING LAIC AS ALL INSTRUMENT OF POWER AND ALL IMAGINED REALM THAT NONE-THELESS ALSO TRANSCENDED POWER AND OPERATED OUTSIDE ITS AMBIT, THE PAPER SEEKS TO BROADEN THE HISTORY OF THE "RULE OF LAW" BEYOND ENRO-AMERICA.
54	HUNGARIAN LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP IS DOMINATED BY A FORMAL, "TECHNICAL" CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THIS IS EVEN TRUER IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS FACT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY ANALYSING THE CASE-LAW OF THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITH REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND CRIMINAL STATUTES. IN CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINT PROCEEDINGS THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS RULED OUT LEGAL CERTAINTY ISSUES FROM THE REVIEW OF LEGAL NORMS AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS BY STATING THAT LEGAL CERTAINTY IS NOT A VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE AND DOES NOT RAISE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR ARGUES FOR THE CLAIM THAT CONCEIVING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CERTAINTY AS A FORMAL AND TECHNICAL VALUE WHICH IS ISOLATED FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL MORALITY, CAN LEAD TO A NARROW AND WEAK PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CERTAINTY ISSUES ARE REGARDED AS AMORAL VALUES, (CRIMINAL) NORMS CAN BECOME SERVANTS OF POLITICAL INTERESTS WHERE HIGHLY UNJUST LAWS CAN BE HELD TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL.
55	THIS ARTICLE PUTS IN THE CENTRE THE INCREASINGLY NOTABLE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AS A FORM AND ITS ACTUAL PRACTICE IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON SLOVENIA. IT DOES SO BY FOLLOWING MARTIN KRYGIER WHO HAS LONG INSISTED WITH REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW THAT "WE WOULD DO WELL TO EXPLORE [...] THE SOCIOLOGY OF THE RULE OF LAW.'' AS HE HAS NOTED, "THIS IS A SOCIAL SCIENCE THAT DOES NOT QUITE YET EXIST''. AS A RESULT, ESPECIALLY LAWYERS HAVE SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH STUDYING THE RULE OF LAW IN CONCEPTUAL TERMS, LIMITING THEMSELVES TO DRAWING A LAUNDRY LIST OF FORMAL REQUIREMENTS THAT AN IDEAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD MEET HERE AND THERE, INDEED EVERYWHERE. WHAT HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED, HOWEVER, BY ACADEMICS AND INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS ALIKE, IS A SOCIAL DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE FORMAL LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS TOO OFTEN IGNORED THE BROADER SOCIAL CONTEXT, WHEREIN, RATHER THAN IN THE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES, LIES "A GREAT DEAL THAT MATTERS MOST TO WHETHER LAW CAN RULE.'' THE SAME CONCLUSION AS TO THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE APPLIED TO A WIDER NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. LEST WE ARE LEFT WITH A PARTIAL, SUPERFICIAL OR EVEN FLAWED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT, OUR FOCUS MUST BE CENTRED ON THE CONSTITUTIVE SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THE LATTER'S SOCIOLOGICAL DIMENSION SHALL NOT REMAIN OUTSIDE LEGAL THEORY, AS IT HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN THE CASE SO FAR. TO PREVENT THAT THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHAT IS IT IN THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN SOCIETIES, SUCH AS HUNGARY, POLAND AND SLOVENIA, THAT INHIBITS THE FORMAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY TO DELIVER ITS INTENDED EFFECTS IN PRACTICE? IN PURSUIT OF THE ANSWERS, THE ARTICLE WILL BE BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE PARTS. FIRST, WE ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AS IT HAS DEVELOPED BOTH IN THE SLOVENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE AND IN THEORY. HAVING PASSED THE CONCEPTUAL THRESHOLD, THE NEXT PART WILL OUTLINE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, AS APPLIED TO THE SLOVENIAN CASE. OF COURSE, DUE TO THE SPACE CONSTRAINTS THE DISCUSSION WILL BE NECESSARILY SCHEMATIC AND WILL BE USED TO RESPOND TO THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION OF THIS ARTICLE, WHICH BOILS TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE MAIN SOCIAL FACTORS THAT HINDER THE ACTUAL EMERGENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN SLOVENIA. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE WILL CLOSE DOWN WITH SOME NORMATIVE PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING THE STATE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL EUROPE IN THE NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE.
56	RESEARCH BACKGROUND: TOURISM SECTOR IS CONSIDERED AS A DRIVING FORCE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND UNDERSTANDING FACTORS THAT DETER THE FLOW OF TOURISTS AND HINDER ITS DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR ALL ACTORS INVOLVED IN THIS INDUSTRY.PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, AND TERRORISM ON TOURISM IN 14 COASTAL STATES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA BASED ON THE UNITED NATIONS CLASSIFICATION.METHODS: THE SHORT AND LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, TERRORISM AND TOURISM ARE RESPECTIVELY ANALYZED THROUGH DUMITRESCU AND HURLIN CAUSALITY TEST AND LM BOOTSTRAP COINTEGRATION TEST TAKING NOTICE OF THE PRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY AND CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCE.FINDINGS & VALUE ADDED: THE CAUSALITY ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON TOURISM ONLY IN THE SHORT RUN. THE COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS UNCOVERS THAT TERRORISM NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE TOURISM IN ALBANIA, ALGERIA, EGYPT, AND TUNISIA, BUT IMPROVEMENTS IN CORRUPTION ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE TOURISM IN ALBANIA, ALGERIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, GREECE AND ITALY. LAST, THE RULE OF LAW HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON TOURISM IN EGYPT, GREECE, AND ISRAEL. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE RULE OF LAW CAN ALSO BE A KEY FACTOR FOR TOURISM DEVELOPMENT VIA COMBAT WITH CORRUPTION AND TERRORISM. BASED ON SOME UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS, THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS POSITION AS THE WORLD'S LEADING TOURIST DESTINATION, BUT TO MAINTAIN THIS COMPETITIVE POSITION, IT IS CRUCIAL TO RECOGNIZE AND ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT RESPOND TO ALL KEY CHALLENGES FACED BY THIS SECTOR.
57	IN AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE PHENOMENON, EXISTING STUDIES POSTULATE INSTITUTIONAL AND NORMATIVE MODELS BUT TREAT THEM AS CONTENDING AND MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EXPLANATIONS. THIS APPROACH IS BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY FLAWED. EXTANT INSTITUTIONAL MODELS FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS HAVE AN IMPACT ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF REQUISITE NORMATIVE FACTORS. SIMILARLY, NORMATIVE MODELS FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NORMATIVE FACTORS HAVE THE HYPOTHESIZED IMPACT ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. SINCE THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN INTERACTION EFFECT IS OVERLOOKED, EXISTING EMPIRICAL MODELS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE ARE MISSPECIFIED. THIS STUDY FILLS THE GAP BY INTRODUCING A MULTIPLICATIVE INTERACTION MODEL. THIS STUDY PRESENTS EVIDENCE THAT, CETERIS PARIBUS, FOR DEMOCRATIC DYADS IN WHICH THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL AND NORMATIVE CONSTRAINTS IS HIGH, THE LIKELIHOOD OF INTERSTATE DISPUTES IS LOWER THAN FOR NONDEMOCRATIC DYADS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE DEMOCRATIC PEACE PHENOMENON SHOULD BE SEEN PRIMARILY AS AN OUTCOME OF INSTITUTIONAL AND NORMATIVE CONSTRAINTS WORKING TOGETHER.
58	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL. THE PRACTICAL POWER OF THE COUNCIL IS CONSTITUTED AT THE INTERSECTION OF ITS LEGAL FRAMING, ITS POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, AND THE INTERESTS OF POWERFUL STATES. THIS SOMETIMES MEANS THE COUNCIL HAS LESS POWER THAN IS ASSIGNED TO IT BY THE UN CHARTER, BUT IT OFTEN MEANS THAT IT HAS MORE. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COUNCIL SITS WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM, THE LEGAL LIMITS ON ITS ACTION ARE INTERPRETED IN LIGHT OF PRIOR COUNCIL PRACTICE, AND THUS THE MEANING OF 'COMPLIANCE' AND 'VIOLATION' OF THE CHARTER CHANGES OVER TIME. SOME TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE CHARTER ARE UNDERSTOOD AS INFORMAL AMENDMENTS TO IT; OTHERS ARE SEEN AS THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY THAT IMPEL ENFORCEMENT ACTION. THIS AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW AND PRACTICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IS INHERENT IN THE IDEA OF THE 'INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW'. THE COUNCIL STRADDLES THE UNSTABLE BOUNDARY BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS, BOTH UNDERMINING AND REINFORCING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM.
59	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CENTRALITY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN NEO-LIBERAL IDEOLOGY. IT ARGUES THAT NEO-LIBERALISM IS NOT SIMPLY A ONE-DIMENSIONAL SET OF ECONOMIC IDEAS DIRECTED AT PROMOTING THE FREE MARKET, BUT IS AN IDEOLOGY WITH BROADER POLITICAL DIMENSIONS. AT THE CORE OF NEO-LIBERALISM IS A SERIOUS DOCTRINE ABOUT POLITICS AND THE PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. NEO-LIBERALS LIKE F.A. HAYEK, MILTON FRIEDMAN AND JAMES BUCHANAN RECOGNISED THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING MARKET ORDER, A CORRESPONDING POLITICAL ORDER IS A VITAL COROLLARY. HOWEVER, THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT A NUMBER OF CONTRADICTIONS AND TENSIONS SIT AT THE HEART OF THE NEO-LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF POLITICS: THOSE THAT EXIST BETWEEN FREEDOM AND THE STATE, LIBERTY AND DEMOCRACY, AND LAW AND LEGISLATION. THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT ONE OF THE MOST DAUNTING TASKS FACING NEO-LIBERAL POLITICIANS AND THEORISTS IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WILL BE TO OVERCOME THE CONSTITUTIONAL "IGNORANCE' OF WESTERN DEMOCRACIES AND INSTITUTE A FRAMEWORK OF RULES, CONVENTIONS OR PROCEDURES THROUGH WHICH THE POWERS OF GOVERNMENT CAN BE ADEQUATELY CONSTRAINED.
60	THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS HAS RESULTED IN THE TRIPLING OF RULINGS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NEW MECHANISMS TO TACKLE IT. NEVERTHELESS, THE ABOVE RULINGS AND MECHANISMS SET SIGHTS ON A PARTICULAR DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, NAMELY THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, DESPITE ITS PROTEAN AND MULTIFACETED NATURE. THE FIGHT AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS TAKES SHAPE IN THE SO-CALLED RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY REGULATION AS WELL AS IN TECHNO-MANAGERIAL MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN SEMESTER, THE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE FACILITY AND THE EUROPEAN STRUCTURAL AND INVESTMENT FUNDS. WHILE FINANCIAL SANCTIONS AIM AT RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW, THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A SERIES OF CRITICISMS; HISTORICALLY FINANCIAL SANCTIONS ARE SAID TO FOLLOW THE OUTLAWRY OF WAR PROCLAIMED BY THE BRIAND-KELLOGG PACT THROUGH THE MAXIME "NEVER AGAIN DECLARE OR TAKE PART IN WAR", WHICH BRINGS ABOUT A "NEW LEGAL ORDER". IF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS BECOME THE STANDARD WAY OF APPLYING EUROPEAN RULES, THESE WOULD NOT ALWAYS BE CLEAR-CUT AS REGARDS THE PROTECTION OF COMMON VALUES.
61	BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2002, THE CZECH EU COUNCIL PRESIDENCY CAME TO AN END. CZECHIA WAS HOLDING THE ROTATING COUNCIL PRESIDENCY FOR THE SECOND TIME AND LIKE IN 2009 ITS PRESIDENCY TRIO WAS ROUNDED OUT BY THE PRECEDING FRENCH PRESIDENCY AND THE FOLLOWING SWEDISH ONE. THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CZECH PRESIDENCIES WAS THE CHANGED INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. WHILE THE 2009 PRESIDENCY TOOK PLACE ON THE VERGE OF THE ENTRANCE INTO FORCE OF THE LISBON TREATY, THE TREATY NEVERTHELESS ONLY CAME INTO EFFECT IN DECEMBER 2009, A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER THE CZECHS PASSED THE PRESIDENCY BATON TO THE SWEDES. THE 2022 CZECH PRESIDENCY WAS THUS THE FIRST THAT THE COUNTRY HELD UNDER THE LISBON RULES. THESE RULES CURTAILED THE ROLE OF THE ROTATING PRESIDENCY IN TERMS OF PRESIDING OVER THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL AS WELL AS THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PRACTICALITIES OF THE CZECH PRESIDENCY WERE AFFECTED BY THE SUDDENLY CHANGED INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT FOLLOWING THE RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE. THE CZECH PRESIDENCY AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENCY TRIO HAD TO REVISE THEIR PRIORITIES AND THE ENTIRE EU WAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. THIS SPECIAL FORUM CONTAINING SEVEN ARTICLES PROVIDES AN EARLY ANALYSIS THAT ENGAGES THE EXISTING SCHOLARLY LITERATURE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF CZECHIA AT THE HELM OF THE EU.
62	THE RULE OF LAW IS A CHECK ON POWER, REQUIRING EQUALSUBJECTION OF EVERYONE TO THE LAW, IRRESPECTIVE OF WEALTH OR STATUS. POWER ISNOT THE EXCLUSIVE PRESERVE OF THE STATE, HOWEVER, ESPECIALLY WHERE RIVALLED BY PRIVATEENTITIES THAT RISE, IN EFFECT, ABOVE THE LAW. TODAY'S TECH GIANTS THROW THERULE OF LAW OUT OF KILTER BY ASSUMING THE TRAPPINGS OF THE STATE- ONE EVEN HASITS OWN "SUPREME COURT"- WHILE SHUNNING ITS ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY SEEK TO DISSUADE,CAPTURE AND EVADE ANY ATTEMPT BY THE STATE TO MITIGATE THE HARMS ARISING FROMTHEIR BUSINESS MODELS. POLICYMAKERS SCRAMBLING FOR INNOVATIVE LEGISLATIVETECHNIQUES ARE UNLIKELY TO REPAIR THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXTREME CONCENTRATION OFCORPORATE POWER SO LONG AS UNDERLYING SOCIAL INJUSTICES AND OVER-DEFERENCE INDEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS GO UNCHALLENGED. LEVIATHAN, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENTOR CORPORATION, CANNOT COEXIST WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
63	THIS ARTICLE POINT OUT THE PROGRESSIVE ENRICHMENT BY WHICH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS CONCEPT HAVE GONE THROUGH, PROVIDING TO HOLDERS -GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUALS- NOT ONLY RIGHTS, LIBERTIES, POWERS AND IMMUNITY BUT ALSO THE OBLIGATION TO RESPECT, DEFEND, GUARANTEE AND PROMOTE ALL THEM REGARDLESS THE CONDUCT DISPLAYED BY THE HOLDER IN THIS FIELD. WITH THIS IN MIND, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES ARBITRATION DEFINITION AND MAIN CHARACTERISTICS, HIGHLIGHTING ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION PROPOSING A SYSTEMATIC READING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
64	WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION ON THE RULE OF LAW AFTER CIVIL WAR? RULE OF LAW REQUIRES NOT ONLY THAT STATE AUTHORITIES ABIDE BY LEGAL LIMITS ON THEIR POWER, BUT ALSO THAT CITIZENS RELY ON STATE LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS TO ADJUDICATE DISPUTES. USING AN ORIGINAL SURVEY AND LIST EXPERIMENT IN LIBERIA, I SHOW THAT EXPOSURE TO THE UN MISSION IN LIBERIA (UNMIL) INCREASED CITIZENS' RELIANCE ON STATE OVER NONSTATE AUTHORITIES TO RESOLVE THE MOST SERIOUS INCIDENTS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE, AND INCREASED NONSTATE AUTHORITIES' RELIANCE ON LEGAL OVER ILLEGAL MECHANISMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION. I USE MULTIPLE IDENTIFICATION STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT A CAUSAL INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS, INCLUDING AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES STRATEGY THAT LEVERAGES PLAUSIBLY EXOGENOUS VARIATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF UNMIL PERSONNEL INDUCED BY THE KILLING OF SEVEN PEACEKEEPERS IN NEIGHBORING COTE D'IVOIRE. MY RESULTS ARE STILL DETECTABLE TWO YEARS LATER, EVEN IN COMMUNITIES THAT REPORT NO FURTHER EXPOSURE TO PEACEKEEPERS. I ALSO FIND THAT EXPOSURE TO UNMIL DID NOT MITIGATE AND MAY IN FACT HAVE EXACERBATED CITIZENS' PERCEPTIONS OF STATE CORRUPTION AND BIAS IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT THAT THESE APPARENTLY ADVERSE EFFECTS DISSIPATED OVER TIME. I CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING IMPLICATIONS OF THESE COMPLEX BUT OVERALL BENEFICIAL EFFECTS.
65	THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) WILL COMMEMORATE ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2015. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, WTO HAS ACCEPTED THIRTY-FOUR NEW MEMBERS RANGING FROM SOME OF WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMIES TO SOME OF THE LEAST DEVELOPED. OF THEM, CHINA'S ACCESSION HAS BEEN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC EVENTS. 'THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE WTO, FOR CHINA AND FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION', SAID THE WTO'S DIRECTOR-GENERAL, MIKE MOORE, COMMENTING ON THE APPROVAL OF CHINA'S ACCESSION ON 10 NOVEMBER 2001. CHINA'S MEMBERSHIP OF THE WTO HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS FOR BOTH THE WTO AND CHINA. THE WTO HAS NOT ONLY MADE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO THE STRENGTH AND STABILITY OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY HELPING TO BOOST TRADE GROWTH, RESOLVE NUMEROUS TRADE DISPUTES AND SUPPORT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO INTEGRATE INTO THE TRADING SYSTEM, BUT ALSO PLAYED A PIVOTAL ROLE IN STRENGTHENING MULTILATERALISM, ESTABLISHING AN INCLUSIVE WORLD ECONOMIC ORDER AND PROMOTING AN OPEN, RULES-BASED AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. SINCE ADMISSION TO THE WTO, CHINA NOT ONLY BECAME THE LARGEST TRADING NATION OF GOODS IN 2013, BUT ALSO HAS SET A NEW BLUEPRINT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN 2014. NO DOUBT, THE RULE OF LAW IN TRADE ENCOURAGED BY THE WTO HAS PROMOTED AND WILL FURTHER PUSH THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. THE WTO PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW IN TRADE IN CHINA IN AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING FIVE DIMENSIONS: THE OPTIMIZATION OF CHINA'S TRADE INSTITUTIONS, THE LEGALIZATION OF CHINA'S TRADING SYSTEM, THE STRENGTHENING OF CHINA'S TRADE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY, THE PROMOTION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW ON CHINA'S TRADE-RELATED GOVERNMENTAL DECISIONS AND THE PERFECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S TRADE.
66	THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AS THE CORE OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW, IS A COMPLEX REALITY THAT HAS DIFFERENTIAL ASPECTS IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES, ACCORDING TO THEIR PREVIOUS LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION, THEIR LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE NATURE AND INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE JUDICIAL POWERS AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.
67	POLITICAL CRISES, TERRORISM, POROUS INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARIES, COUPS D'ETAT, AND SOCIO-POLITICAL UPHEAVALS ALL UNDERLINE THE NEED TO RETHINK WHAT SECURITY MEANS IN THE SAHEL REGION. WHILE INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL APPROACHES TO SECURITY STILL TAKE PREDOMINANTLY MILITARY AND MACRO-POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES, THERE IS A NEED TO ETHNOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIBE AND ANALYSE SECURITY FROM BELOW. TO THIS END, CITIZENS' OWN INITIATIVES SHOULD BE CENTRAL TO CONTEMPORARY ANALYSES OF AFRICAN PEACEMAKING INTERVENTIONS. THIS ARTICLE TAKES THE GROWING AND DIVERSE MOVEMENTS OF SELF-DEFENCE GROUPS IN BURKINA FASO AND MALI AS A STARTING POINT FOR ANALYSING HOW SECURITY CAN BE SEEN FROM BELOW', OFTEN IN INTERACTION WITH AND SOMETIMES EVEN IN OUTRIGHT CONTRADICTION WITH THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE LOCAL SELF-DEFENCE GROUPS CONSTITUTE A CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW, ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK IN MALI AND BURKINA FASO REVEALS A HIGH DEGREE OF ADAPTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF THESE MOVEMENTS. THIS ARTICLE FURTHERMORE DISCUSSES METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WHEN DOING ETHNOGRAPHIC RESEARCH IN DANGEROUS TERRAINS, DRAWING ON FIELDWORK IN THE SAHEL, AND CONSIDERS IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY OF SECURITY FROM BELOW' FOR THE WIDER STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.
68	A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IS EMERGING IN MEXICO TO ADDRESS INVESTMENT AND EXPROPRIATION DISPUTES. ASSURANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, UNDERSTOOD AS INDEPENDENT LEGAL PROCESS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, IS A KEY ELEMENT. ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW ASSUMED GROWING IMPORTANCE AS MEXICO'S HISTORICAL EXPROPRIATIONS PROGRESSED, QUESTIONS PERSISTED AS TO ITS EFFECTIVE APPLICATION. MEXICO'S OPENING TO GLOBAL COMPETITION FOR INVESTMENT IN THE 1990S DEMANDED A GREATER BASIS FOR TRUST IN SUCH APPLICATION. MEXICO ACCORDINGLY PROVIDED BY TREATY TO DEFER INVESTMENT AND EXPROPRIATION DISPUTES WITH TREATY COUNTRY INVESTORS TO BINDING INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. TO ADDRESS RULE OF LAW CONCERNS MORE BROADLY, MEXICO REFORMED ITS CONSTITUTION IN 1994 TO INCREASE ITS FEDERAL JUDICIARY'S INDEPENDENCE. MORE RECENTLY, FEDERAL JUDICIAL REVIEW HAS BENEFITED FROM THE MEXICAN CONSTITUTION'S INCREASED RIGIDITY CONSEQUENT TO THE FADING OF SINGLE PARTY RULE. RECENT CASES, INCLUDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE METALCLAD INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECLARATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF TREATIES RELATIVE TO LEGISLATION, AND THE COURT'S RESOLUTION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL DISPUTE BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR, DELINEATE THE EMERGING DESIGN AND ASSOCIATED, INNOVATIVE JUDICIAL DOCTRINE.
69	REREADING GROTIUS IN 2019 AS A SEQUEL TO THE 1990 AND 2009 EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS ON 'THE POLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW', AT A TIME OF STAGGERING GLOBAL INEQUALITY, MARTTI KOSKENNIEMI ASKS WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM GROTIUS ABOUT THE 'TENDENCY [OF HUMANS] TO SUBORDINATE THEMSELVES' TO LAW AND, I MAY ADD, THE LIMITS OF THAT TENDENCY. WHILE I AGREE WITH KOSKENNIEMI THAT GROTIUS' RULE-OF-LAW' CONCEPTION MAY HELP US UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT BACKLASH AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, I SUGGEST AN ALTERNATIVE READING OF THIS CONCEPTION THAT MAY ASSIST US EVEN MORE. GROTIUS' UNDERSTANDING OF HUMANS AND OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECTIVE AND DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE AS COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW HELPS US SEE THE CRY 'TAKE BACK CONTROL' AS 'INDIGNATION' ABOUT THE (SOCIAL) INJUSTICES AND GLOBAL INEQUALITY THAT INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS (RE)PRODUCE AND AS A CRY FOR JUST INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. KOSKENNIEMI'S FOREWORD RIGHTLY ASKS: WHAT IS 'REQUIRED OF US'? I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT BACKLASH AS AN INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS AS WELL AS A CRISIS OF SELFHOOD. READING GROTIUS MAY ENCOURAGE US TO INCLUDE CRITICAL LANGUAGE OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE IN OUR 'BRICOLAGE' TO ADDRESS 'LEGITIMATE POPULAR GRIEVANCE' ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND ADDRESS THE HUMAN DESIRE FOR JUST INSTITUTIONS ALSO AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
70	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW IS UNDERGOING A PARADIGM SHIFT, WHICH WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS. A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF LEGAL MACHINERY, INSTITUTIONS, AND PROCESSES IS OCCURRING IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE. NOW, MORE THAN EVER BEFORE FOREIGN POLICY DECISION-MAKING OCCURS IN THE SHADOW OF THE LAW. THE CONCEPTION OF A NEW RULE OF LAW IS AT STAKE; APPROPRIATE TO THE PRESENT STATE OF GLOBAL POLITICS, AS IT AIMS TO MANAGE HEIGHTENED POLITICAL CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE THROUGH LAW. THE IMPACT OF THE JURIDICAL PARADIGM SHIFT IS PRIMARILY DISCURSIVE. THE EXPANDED LEGAL DISCOURSE REPRESENTED BY THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM CONTRIBUTES A RHETORIC THAT BOTH ENABLES AND CONSTRAINS POLITICS; BUT WHOSE CONSTRUCTIVE POTENTIAL IS NOT INFINITELY MALLEABLE. UNDERSTANDING THIS PARADIGM SHIFT REQUIRES NEW INTERPRETIVE PRINCIPLES, WHICH IS THE LARGER PROJECT FOR WHICH THIS ARTICLE LAYS THE FOUNDATION.
71	THE BASIC LAW, CONSTITUTING THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATION REGION, DRAWS A UNIQUE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE POWER OF FINAL INTERPRETATION AND THE POWER OF FINAL ADJUDICATION. UNLIKE COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS, AUTHORITATIVE INTERPRETATION IS INVESTED OUTSIDE THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL COURT SYSTEMS IN THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS. THE APPROACH MARKS A CLEAR DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS INTEGRAL TO THE RULE OF LAW IN A COMMON LAW SYSTEM. YET IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT IT ERODES THE VALUES THAT THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SCOPE OF THE INTERPRETIVE POWER, THE CHARACTER OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE AND THE FREQUENCY AND WAY IN WHICH THE POWER IS EXERCISED TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL EFFECT OF STANDING COMMITTEE INTERPRETATION OF HKSAR COURTS. IT CONCLUDES THAT DESPITE THE POTENTIAL TENSIONS INHERENT IS SUCH A SYSTEM, THE PROVISIONS OF THE BASIC LAW ENSURE THAT THE DECISIONS OF HKSAR COURTS ARE RESPECTED, EVEN IF THEIR INTERPRETATIONS ON OCCASION GIVE WAY.
72	THE EU'S FOUNDATIONAL VALUES DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW ARE SHARED BY THE MEMBER STATES AND ROOTED IN THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS. CONSTITUTIONAL PLURALISM RECOGNISES THE LEGITIMACY OF PARALLEL LEGAL SYSTEMS. PLURALISM HOWEVER CANNOT PROVIDE ANSWERS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DESIGN AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOUNDATIONAL VALUES, WHICH REQUIRE HOMOGENEOUS ACCEPTANCE THROUGHOUT THE UNION. DEFICIENCIES AFFECT THE ENTIRE UNION LEGAL ORDER. THE ARGUMENT OF NATIONAL IDENTITY IN ART. 4(2) TEU MUST NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A MEANS TO UNDERMINE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW, BUT IS AN EU-LAW INTERNAL COUNTERBALANCING INSTRUMENT. THIS IS OF RELEVANCE BECAUSE, WHEN ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES, THE ENFORCEMENT UNDER ART. 7 TEU MAY INTERFERE WITH EFFECTIVELY INTERNAL MATTERS OF MEMBER STATES. IN ORDER TO PROTECT COMMON VALUES THE EU HAS TO AVAIL ITSELF OF SAFEGUARDING COMPETENCES UNDER UNION LAW, EVEN IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF APPLICATION OF EU LAW STRICTO SENSU (THE ACQUIS). USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED THAT VALUE PROTECTION IS A PREDOMINANTLY POLITICAL TASK THAT CALLS FOR POLITICAL SOLUTIONS TOGETHER WITH EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW DIALOGUES, AND NEEDS EU INSTITUTIONS TO ACT AS FACILITATORS AND GUARDIANS OF THE TREATIES BY MAKING USE OF THE ENFORCEMENT INSTRUMENTS UNDER ART. 7 TEU AND ART. 258 TFEU. IN PARALLEL, A CULTURE OF VALUES COULD BE FOSTERED BY AN EVIDENCE-BASED MONITORING WITHIN A NEW INSTRUMENT OF CVM FOR ALL (COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM).
73	DOES THE EU HAVE ENOUGH LEVERAGE TO POLICE THE RULE OF LAW IN MEMBER STATES? THIS ARTICLE FIRST OUTLINES HOW THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE IS FUNCTIONALLY ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS BREACHES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT ARGUES THAT EU LAW ENTAILS "STRUCTURAL OBLIGATIONS" FOR MEMBER STATES TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THEIR LEGAL SYSTEMS. TO THE EXTENT RESPECTING SUCH STRUCTURAL OBLIGATIONS IS INDISPENSABLE FOR OBSERVING SPECIFIC EU LAW RULES, THEIR BREACH CAN BE THE TARGET OF INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS. THE ARTICLE THEN ANALYSES THE EU'S LEVERAGE TO GUARANTEE THE AUTHORITY OF EU LAW IN CASE OF MEMBER STATES' NON-COMPLIANCE WITH FINES IMPOSED IN THAT PROCEDURE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE RECOVERY OF FINES BY SET-OFF AGAINST EU MONEY ENABLES EFFECTIVE POLICING IF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS DEFICIENT, AND CONSTITUTES, THEREFORE, AN ESSENTIAL CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER.
74	FACED WITH GROWING PRESSURES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF LEGAL WORK, THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COMMUNITY HAS FOCUSED ATTENTION ON SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. TAKING A WORKPLACE PERSPECTIVE, THIS STUDY DEVELOPS AND TESTS AN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL MEASURE OF SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CANADIAN PUBLIC SECTOR. RESULTS FROM A NATIONAL SURVEY OF GOVERNMENT-EMPLOYED LAWYERS REVEAL THAT INCREASING WORK DEMANDS HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON PERCEIVED ABILITY TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW IN THE DAILY EXECUTION OF WORK TASKS. THIS NEGATIVE PRESSURE IS MODERATED BY SOCIAL SUPPORT IN THE WORKPLACE, WITH DIMINISHING EFFECT. LAWYERS IN CRIMINAL LAW PRACTICE APPEAR MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY WORK DEMANDS THAN THOSE IN CIVIL OR COMMON LAW PRACTICES.
75	ENFORCEMENT OF THE EU COMPETITION RULES, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO CARTELS AND CARTELISTS, INVOLVES A COMPLEX JURISDICTIONAL PATCHWORK, CHARACTERISE BY INCONSISTENCY BUT ALSO A STRONG PUBLIC RHETORIC WHICH MASKS POLICY AND PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES, APPLICATION OF THE RULES TO DIFFERENT LEGAL CATEGORIES OF ACTOR, GEOGRAPHICAL AND JURISDICTIONAL DIVERSITY, AND THE UNEVEN USE OF ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AND SANCTIONS GIVE RISE TO A NUMBER OF RULE OF LAW ISSUES IN THE FORM OF INCONSISTENT TREATMENT, UNCERTAINTY AND LACK OF PROPORTIONALITY. THE DISCUSSION HERE MAPS OUT AND ILLUSTRATES THESE PROBLEMS AND SUGGESTS THAT THESE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH A MORE CRITICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE CLAIMS MADE FOR DETERRENCE AS AN ENFORCEMENT IMPERATIVE IN THIS CONTEXT.
76	ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REACTIONS TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IS TAKING EMERGENCY MEASURES BASED ON NECESSITY. NOWADAYS, IT IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT DUE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE THREATENING FACTORS TO THE SOCIETY, COLLECTIVE SECURITY IS PERMANENTLY AT SERIOUS RISK. THEREFORE, THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS THE NORMAL STATE OF OUR TIME. ACCORDING TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE CHANGED IN FAVOUR OF PUBLIC INTEREST AND SECURITY AS ONE OF ITS ELEMENTS. THUS, THE CENTRAL ISSUE OF THIS IDEA, CALLED EXCEPTIONALISM, IS HOW TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN RIGHTS AND PUBLIC SECURITY. IN RESPONSE, DIFFERENT THEORETICAL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD. THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT EXTRA-LEGAL MEASURES APPROACH THAT, BY EMPHASISING ON UNUSUAL PRACTICES, FIRST AVOIDS THE NORMALISATION OF EMERGENCY ACTIONS AND THEIR GENERALISATION TO NORMAL SITUATIONS, SECONDLY, IT PREVENTS US TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN NOTIONS OF 'US AND THEM', FINALLY, POINTS OUT THE NEED FOR AN EX-POST RATIFICATION, IS JUSTIFIABLE IN THE LIGHT OF FOUCAULT'S IDEA OF GOVERNMENTALITY.
77	ALTHOUGH THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA HAS RECOGNISED THE RULE OF LAW AS A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, IT IS RARELY REFERRED TO BY LOWER COURTS. THE NEW SOUTH WALES COURT OF APPEAL CASE, WOOLWORTHS LTD V PALLAS NEWCO PTY LTD (2004) 61 NSWLR 707, PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AUSTRALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. WOOLWORTHS WAS HEAVILY BASED ON PLAINTIFF S157/2002 V COMMONWEALTH (2003) 211 CLR 476 AND ENFIELD CITY V DEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT COMMISSION (2000) 199 CLR 135, TWO HIGH COURT DECISIONS WHICH EMPHASISED THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. IN WOOLWORTHS, THE COURT OF APPEAL REFRAINED FROM EXPLICITLY UTILISING RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE AND DISTINGUISHED AN ASPECT OF THE HIGH COURT'S REASONING IN PLAINTIFF S157. THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE REGARD IS HAD TO THE RULE OF LAW, COURTS AT ALL LEVELS SHOULD ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT.
78	THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHETHER DEMOCRATIZATION, UNDER CERTAIN HISTORICAL CONDITIONS, MAY RELATE TO THE DETERIORATING RULE OF LAW. FOCUSING ON MEXICO CITY, WHERE POLICE CORRUPTION IS SIGNIFICANT, THIS STUDY ARGUES THAT THE INSTITUTIONALIZED LEGACIES OF POLICE POWER INHERITED FROM MEXICO'S ONE-PARTY SYSTEM HAVE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED ITS NEWLY DEMOCRATIC STATE'S EFFORTS TO REFORM THE POLICE. MEXICO'S DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION HAS CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT OF PARTISAN COMPETITION THAT, COMBINED WITH DECENTRALIZATION OF THE STATE AND FRAGMENTATION OF ITS COERCIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS, EXACERBATES INTRASTATE AND BUREAUCRATIC CONFLICTS. THESE FACTORS PREVENT THE GOVERNMENT FROM REFORMING THE POLICE SUFFICIENTLY TO GUARANTEE PUBLIC SECURITY AND EARN CITIZEN TRUST, EVEN AS THE SAME FACTORS REDUCE CAPACITY, LEGITIMACY, AND CITIZEN CONFIDENCE IN BOTH THE POLICE AND THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED STATE. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT WHEN DEMOCRACY SERVES TO UNDERMINE RATHER THAN STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW, MORE DEMOCRACY CAN ACTUALLY DIMINISH DEMOCRACY AND ITS QUALITY.
79	THIS ARTICLE IS A REPLY TO RUIPING YE'S ARTICLE ON CHINA'S JOURNEY TOWARDS SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. YE ARGUES THAT DESPITE A STRING OF LEGAL REFORMS, CHINA REMAINS A SYSTEM OF RULE BY LAW RATHER THAN RULE OF LAW. YE PROVIDES TWO MAIN OBSERVATIONS. ONE IS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S INSTRUMENTAL PERCEPTION OF LAW, AND THE OTHER IS THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S NEED TO MAINTAIN LEGAL LEGITIMACY. THIS ARTICLE AGREES WITH YE'S TWO OBSERVATIONS, AND EXTENDS THE DISCUSSION FURTHER TO THE FUTURE OF SUCH A RULE BY LAW OR WHAT OTHER SCHOLARS CALL AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY. BY HIGHLIGHTING AN INTENSELY DEBATED ISSUE ON WHETHER TO FURTHER LEGALIZE OR CONSTITUTIONALIZE THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S ABSOLUTE RULE, THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS THE GRADUAL AND FORMATIVE FUNCTION OF LAW IN BRINGING PROFOUND CHANGE. PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY ARE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF LEGITIMACY GENERATED BY AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY AND THE EFFICACY OF A LEGAL TRANSFORMATION FROM WITHIN.
80	THIS PAPER AIMS TO CHALLENGE THE DISPARAGEMENT OF NON-STATE ISLAMIC SYSTEMS OF LAW THAT HAS ESTABLISHED FIRM ROOTS IN CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW IDEOLOGY AND PRACTICE AROUND THE WORLD, FROM INDIA TO ONTARIO. IN THIS RESPECT, RULE OF LAW IDEOLOGY HAS TENDED TO IGNORE ACTUAL MECHANICS AND PROCEDURES OF LAW, NOT ONLY IN LEGAL VENUES OUTSIDE THE STATE'S DIRECT CONTROL, BUT ALSO IN THE STATE'S COURTS THEMSELVES. WITH RESPECT TO NON-STATE LEGAL VENUES-AND ESPECIALLY NON-STATE ISLAMIC LEGAL VENUES-SUCH IDEOLOGY UNDERSTANDS AND DESCRIBES THE PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT IT FINDS IN THESE NON-STATE VENUES AS CRUDE AND UNDERDEVELOPED AT BEST, AND ILLIBERAL AND IN VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AT WORST. WHILE OTHER SCHOLARLY WORK HAS VIVIDLY DEMONSTRATED THE VARIOUS TRANSFORMATIONS AND MUTATIONS THAT ANY STATE'S 'IDEAL LEGAL PROCEDURE' EXPERIENCES AS IT IS PUT INTO REAL-WORLD PRACTICE BY A STATE'S COURTS AND JUDGES, THIS PAPER MAKES A CONVERSE MOVE. USING A CASE-STUDY FOCUSED ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPERIENCES OF AN INDIAN MUSLIM WOMAN, 'AYESHA', WHO RECENTLY USED A DELHI DAR UL QAZA TO EXERCISE HER ISLAMIC DIVORCE RIGHTS IN INDIA, THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW A NON-STATE ISLAMIC LEGAL VENUE BEHAVES IN WAYS WHICH ARE HIGHLY EVOCATIVE OF RULE OF LAW IDEOLOGY'S IDEALIZATION OF STATE COURTS AND HOW THEY (SHOULD) OPERATE PROCEDURALLY. IN DOING SO, THIS PAPER PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR PARTHA CHATTERJEE'S THESIS AS TO HOW ELITE AND SUBALTERN DOMAINS-UNDERSTOOD HERE TO BE EMBODIED IN BOTH STATE AND NON-STATE LEGAL VENUES, RESPECTIVELY-ARE PRODUCTS OF 'MUTUALLY CONDITIONED HISTORICITIES'. IN THIS CASE, THE FOCUS IS ON THE STATE'S CONDITIONING OF THE NON-STATE. AS A RESULT, RULE OF LAW IDEOLOGY'S STATE-ORIENTED CRITIQUE OF THE (ISLAMIC) NON-STATE IS MISTAKEN BECAUSE, AS THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES, THE NON-STATE IS PRODUCED IN CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE; ONE CANNOT CRITIQUE THE ONE (NON-STATE) DOMAIN WITHOUT REALIZING HOW THAT CRITIQUE IMPLICATES THE OTHER (STATE) DOMAIN.
81	THIS RE-EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND BUSINESS, AND HOW IT MAY BE CHANGING IN RELATION TO INTERNATIONALIZATION, RESPONDS ESPECIALLY TO SOME PROPONENTS OF RELATIONAL CAPITALISM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LAW OR WEBERIAN CAPITALISM, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA. IT REJECTS THE CONCEPTUALIZATION AS A DICHOTOMY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNICAL LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND RELATIONAL OR FAMILIAL RESOURCES, AND SUGGESTS THAT SUCH THEORIES MAY BE TRACED TO THE CONTEXTS IN WHICH THE PREVAILING SOCIOLEGAL EXAMINATIONS OF THAT RELATIONSHIP WERE CONSTRUCTED, LINKING THEM IN PARTICULAR TO SOCIOLEGAL SCHOLAR SHIP IN THE UNITED STATES. IT PROVIDES EXAMPLES FROM CASE STUDIES BASED ON THE AUTHORS' RESEARCH IN MEXICO, AND A REREADING OF THE LITERATURE ON JAPAN, AND CONCLUDES WITH A FRESH LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS OF WHETHER AND, IF SO, WHY, THE EXPORT OF THE US-STYLE 'RULE OF LAW' MAY BE GAINING GROUND IN NEW AND OLD FRONTIERS.
82	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ASK WHAT THE IMPACT IS OF THE ROLE OF THE EU ADMINISTRATION IN RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES IN TERMS OF (CHANGES TO) THE RULE OF LAW. A RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY IN SOME CASES CREATES EXCEPTIONS TO RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES THAT BIND THE AUTHORITIES TO PROCEDURAL RULES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THESE EXCEPTIONS CAN BECOME MORE PERMANENT AND EVEN CHANGE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER OF THE EU. WE ARTICULATE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH EMERGENCIES, AND DISCUSS HOW THE EU COURT HAS INTERPRETED AND DEVELOPED THIS FRAMEWORK IN TWO KEY DECISIONS. WE THEN ASK WHETHER THIS FRAMEWORK OFFERS ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW IN CASES OF MAJOR HEALTH EMERGENCIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES CAN BEND AND EVEN BREAK RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE EU ADMINISTRATION, AND ADVOCATE FOR MORE LEGAL GUIDANCE ON PROPORTIONALITY, WHICH MAY OFFER BETTER SAFEGUARDS SUITED FOR PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF AFFECTED PARTIES.
83	CAMBODIA'S TRIALS OF THE LEADERS OF THE KHMER ROUGE RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS PROCESS OF HISTORICAL ACCOUNTABILITY WILL HAVE A BROADER IMPACT ON CAMBODIAN POLITICAL CULTURE. A REASONABLE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE TRIALS WILL RESTORE CAMBODIANS' FAITH IN THE RULE OF LAW, A FAITH UNDERMINED BY THE FAILURE OF THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE MISCREANTS FOR 30 YEARS. BASED ON A 2007 NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY - CONDUCTED WELL BEFORE THE TRIALS BEGAN - THE AUTHORS FIND THAT CAMBODIANS HOLD A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR STRICT ADHERENCE TO LEGAL UNIVERSALISM. BECAUSE SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS SO STRONG, THE TRIALS ARE UNLIKELY TO MAKE IT STRONGER. UNDERSTANDING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES REQUIRES THAT THE STATE OF SOCIETY PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF JUSTICE PROCESSES BE UNDERSTOOD SO THAT CHANGE CAN BE MEASURED. MOREOVER, CULTURAL VALUES MAY BE JUST AS LIKELY TO BE CAUSES OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES AS RESULTS.
84	CHINA HAS UNDERGONE RAPID URBANISATION OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES. RESEARCH HAS SEEMED TO SUGGEST THAT URBANISATION HAS RESULTED IN LAND EXPROPRIATION. AS LOCAL OFFICIALS BEGAN TO TAKE RURAL LAND FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT, REVENUES FROM LAND LEASES BECAME AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INCOME FOR LOCAL PUBLIC BUDGETS. DESPITE ITS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC BUDGETS, LAND GRABBING IN CHINA HAS STARTED TO DECREASE SINCE XI JINPING TOOK POWER IN THE FALL 2012. WITH THIS AS A STARTING PREMISE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT XI'S CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN HAS IMPACTED UPON LOCAL OFFICIALS' INCENTIVES FOR LAND EXPROPRIATION. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE CHINESE REGIME'S ADVOCACY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATIONS IN THE INTENSITY OF THE CORRUPTION CRACKDOWN.
85	THE THIRD ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE JOURNAL "HERALD OF CIVIL PROCEDURE" "2016 KAZAN ARBITRATION DAY: THE RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONAL GOVERNANCE" WAS HOSTED BY THE LAW FACULTY ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2016. THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE EVENT TOOK PLACE IN THE HALL OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE KAZAN UNIVERSITY, FOLLOWED BY AN ACADEMIC DISCUSSION ON LEGAL ISSUES OF THE SYMPOSIUM. THE SYMPOSIUM PARTICIPANTS AND INVITED GUESTS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE MOST CURRENT AND TOPICAL ISSUES OF CIVIL PROCEDURAL LAW, TO PRESENT THE LATEST RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN ACADEMIC WORKS IN THIS DIRECTION TO COLLEAGUES, TO OFFER FURTHER WAYS OF DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEMPORARY CIVIL PROCEDURE, AND TO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE AND ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE. THE SYMPOSIUM DISCUSSED BOTH THE ISSUES THAT DIRECTLY RELATED TO ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AS WELL AS THE MOST RELEVANT NEWS IN THE FIELD OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS IN GENERAL.
86	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE VIOLENT COUP IN FIJI IN 2000 LED BY GEORGE SPEIGHT IN WHICH THE MULTIRACIAL GOVERNMENT OF MAHENDRA CHAUDHARY WAS OVERTHROWN. THE ARTICLE GIVES AN INSIDER'S ACCOUNT OF A SUBSEQUENT CRIMINAL TRIAL OF SOME SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES WHO HAD SUPPORTED SPEIGHT, INCLUDING THE VICE-PRESIDENT OF FIJI. THEY WERE CHARGED WITH TAKING TREASONOUS OATHS OF OFFICE TO SERVE IN A REBEL GOVERNMENT UNDER SPEIGHT AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGITIMATE HEAD OF STATE, PRESIDENT RATU SIR KAMASISI MARA, WAS STRUGGLING TO PREVENT THE NATION FROM DESCENDING INTO TOTAL CHAOS AND ANARCHY. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS HOW THE TRIAL HAD IMPORTANT RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS DEVELOPING SOUTH PACIFIC NATION.
87	THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DOUBLE GENEALOGY OF INDICATORS AS INSTRUMENTS OF GOVERNANCE. THESE HAVE THEIR ROOTS BOTH IN THE USE OF STATISTICAL TOOLS FOR NORMATIVE PURPOSES BY STATES AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDICATORS WITHIN FIRMS AS PREFERRED INSTRUMENTS OF 'NEW MANAGEMENT'. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT SOCIAL INDICATORS NOT ONLY CONVEY INFORMATION, BUT ARE GENUINE TOOLS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND THAT, FOR THIS REASON, THEIR LEGITIMACY DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THEIR ACCURACY, BUT ALSO ON THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY. IF INDICATORS ARE INTENDED TO PRODUCE OR EFFECTIVELY PRODUCE REGULATORY EFFECTS, THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE ESSAY ENDS BY FORMULATING FOUR MAIN PRINCIPLES THAT THESE INDICATORS SHOULD COMPLY WITH.
88	LONG CHERISHED BY LIBERAL POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS, TODAY THE RULE OF LAW IS INCREASINGLY VIEWED AS A NECESSARY REQUIREMENT, OR EVEN SILVER BULLET, FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE PAST DECADE HAS SEEN THE RISE OF A VERITABLE INDUSTRY-MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS, GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, AND NONGOVERNMENTAL AID ORGANIZATIONS-COMMITTED TO PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY WITHIN CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT THEORY AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE WORLD BANK'S DEVELOPMENT MODEL. IT ASKS HOW AND WHY THE BANK HAS EMBRACED THE RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE, AND OFFERS A BRIEF GENEALOGY OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE BANK'S THEORIZING. IT ARGUES THAT THE BANK'S INTEREST IN LAW WAS PRIMARILY A RESPONSE TO THE CRITIQUE AND FAILURE OF ITS NEOLIBERAL POLICIES AND IDENTIFIES THE NEW DISCOURSE'S AFFINITIES WITH THE RISE OF NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS AND "GOOD GOVERNANCE" IN THE 1990S. UNDER THE BANK'S VIEW, THE LAW'S VALUE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO PROVIDE A STABLE INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE PREDICTABILITY NECESSARY FOR MARKETS TO OPERATE. THE ROLE OF LAW IS REDUCED TO THE FACILITATION OF UTILITY MAXIMIZING EXCHANGE AND OPTIMAL MARKET ALLOCATION, A VIEW THAT INFORMS MANY OF THE BANK'S SPECIFIC LAW REFORM PROJECTS. MORE A RHETORICAL SHIFT THAN A FUNDAMENTAL BREAK IN DEVELOPMENT THEORIZING, THE BANK'S TURN TO LAW ACTUALLY UNDERGIRDS MANY CONTINUED NEOLIBERAL ASSUMPTIONS AND MASKS A CONTINUATION OF NEOLIBERALISM'S CORE TENETS. THE NEW DISCOURSE IS ATTRACTIVE PRECISELY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES STRONG IDEOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEOLIBERAL AGENDA.
89	THE RULE OF LAW IS FREQUENTLY CLAIMED TO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR - IF NOT A NECESSARY ELEMENT - FOR ADVANCING INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AMONG THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS CONFORMITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN THOUGHT TO ADVANCE ARE ECONOMIC GROWTH, LEGAL COMPLIANCE, AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY. YET, AS MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE OBSERVED, ANY ATTEMPT TO DRAW STRAIGHTFORWARD CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THESE AIMS WILL INEVITABLY BE FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE EXIST A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT CONFORMITY TO THE RULE OF LAW CONSISTS IN. IN THIS PAPER, I DRAW ATTENTION TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMPETING "THIN" AND "THICK" CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. UNDERSTANDABLY, THE THIN CONCEPTION'S RELEVANCE FOR ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT AIMS HAS OFTEN BEEN OVERLOOKED IN FAVOR OF THE THICK CONCEPTION'S. NEVERTHELESS, I OFFER HERE A DECISION-THEORETIC ANALYSIS OF THE THIN CONCEPTION'S RELATIONSHIP TO GROWTH, COMPLIANCE, AND RESPECT FOR DIGNITY THAT JUSTIFIES SPECIAL FOCUS ON ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THESE AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, I ARGUE THAT, ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, MEMBERS OF A STATE WHICH VIOLATES THE THIN CONCEPTION WILL HAVE LESS INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE IN PRO-GROWTH CONDUCT AND/OR MORE INCENTIVE TO ENGAGE IN ANTI-GROWTH CONDUCT, LESS INCENTIVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND/OR MORE INCENTIVE TO NOT COMPLY, AND WILL HAVE LESS INCENTIVE TO PERFORM ACTIONS THAT WILL YIELD THEM GREATER UTILITY AND/OR MORE INCENTIVE TO PERFORM ACTIONS THAT WILL YIELD THEM LOWER UTILITY. IN TURN, THIS ANALYSIS PREDICTS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIOLATIONS OF THE THIN CONCEPTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, LEGAL COMPLIANCE, AND THE AMOUNT OF UTILITY MEMBERS OF THE STATE'S DECISIONS WILL YIELD THEM.
90	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE USE AND PROLIFERATION OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION (IN PARTICULAR, THE PROSPECTUS AND PRODUCT DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (PDS) DISCLOSURE REGIMES UNDER THE CORPORATIONS ACT 2001 (CTH)). THE ARTICLE PRESENTS DATA SHOWING THAT THESE REGIMES SUFFER FROM INCONSISTENCY, EXCESSIVE FRAGMENTATION, AND A LACK OF PROPER OVERSIGHT. THESE DEFECTS, WHICH DERIVE IN PART FROM THE PROLIFERATION AND UNDER-REGULATION OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION, UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGIMES BY CONFLICTING WITH RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES IN PARTICULAR THAT THE CURRENT USE OF DELEGATED LEGISLATION IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT SCRUTINY REGIME CREATE PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO COMPLEXITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND REGULATORY CAPTURE. THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT CREATES FURTHER ACCOUNTABILITY PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING OPTIONS FOR REFORMING THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL LIMITS ON THE DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS, AS A CONTRIBUTION TO EFFORTS TO REMEDY SOME OF THESE ISSUES.
91	INTERNATIONAL LAW IS OFTEN REGARDED AS AN OMNIPOTENT FORCE, WHICH, AS A CONSEQUENCE, SUBORDINATES THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THOSE WHO CONSIDER LAW IN ITS LOCAL CUSTOMARY FORM. FRAMED IN THE CONTEXT OF VULNERABLE REFUGEE GROUPS DISPLACED THROUGH CONFLICT AND BEYOND THEIR NATIONAL JURISDICTION, THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES DISCOURSES OF LEGAL PLURALISM AND LEGAL EMPOWERMENT. INCORPORATING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH FROM ZA'ATARI REFUGEE CAMP THIS ARTICLE WILL IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS WHICH REFUGEES FACE WHEN ACCESSING FORMAL LEGAL SERVICES. IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE LEGAL PROCESS, SYRIAN COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE EMERGED OFFERING ALTERNATIVE AVENUES TO PURSUE CIVIL, RELIGIOUS AND CRIMINAL CLAIMS, PROVIDING A LEVEL OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT. THESE GROUPS PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY WHEREBY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS CAN BE REINCORPORATED WHERE THEY ARE OTHERWISE ABSENT.
92	THE TRAGIC, AND OFTEN SHAMEFUL, DISCRIMINATION AGAINST AUSTRALIANS OF GERMAN ORIGIN FOSTERED DURING THE WORLD WARS HAD MANY CONSEQUENCES. NO DOUBT, SOME OF YOU CARRY THE EMOTIONAL SCARS OF INJUSTICE DURING THOSE TIMES AS PART OF YOUR BACKGROUNDS OR FAMILY HISTORIES. LET ME AS GOVERNOR-GENERAL, SAY TO ALL WHO DO HOW PROFOUNDLY SORRY I AM THAT SUCH THINGS HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY. THE CONSTITUTION. IS AN INSTRUMENT FRAMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANY TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS, TO SOME OF WHICH IT GIVES EFFECT, AS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN SEPARATING THE JUDICIAL POWER FROM OTHER FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, OTHERS OF WHICH ARE SIMPLY ASSUMED. AMONG THOSE I THINK THAT IT MAY FAIRLY BE SAID THAT THE RULE OF LAW FORMS AN ASSUMPTION.
93	STRATEGIC LAWSUITS AGAINST PUBLIC PARTICIPATION (SLAPPS) - THE RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING - GOVERNANCE OF HISTORICAL MEMORY - ACADEMIC FREEDOM - EU DRAFT DIRECTIVE ON PROTECTING PERSONS WHO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION FROM MANIFESTLY UNFOUNDED OR ABUSIVE COURT PROCEEDINGS
94	THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE EFFECT THAT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY ARE HAVING UPON THE DISCIPLINE OF LAW IN ACADEMIA, THE PRACTISING PROFESSION AND THE COURTS. IT GIVES EXAMPLES OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING AND ARGUES THAT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE USED TO ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW. IT MAKES SEVERAL PROPOSALS: THAT UNIVERSITIES ADOPT A HYBRID OF ONLINE AND IN-PERSON LEARNING; THAT THE RAW MATERIALS OF THE LAW BE MADE AVAILABLE ONLINE FOR FREE; THAT PUBLISHERS TRANSFORM JOURNAL ARTICLES INTO INTERCONNECTED ONLINE RESOURCES; THAT FIRMS TAKE ADVANTAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND COMPETE VIGOROUSLY TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF LEGAL SERVICES; THAT LAWYERS BE OPEN MINDED AND MOTIVATED ABOUT USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES; AND THAT COURTS ADOPT ELECTRONIC LITIGATION PLATFORMS BUT RESIST RECEDING INTO CYBERSPACE.
95	HOW DOES THE DETERIORATION OF RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA IN RECENT YEARS AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO MOVE AWAY FROM AN EXPORT PATTERN DOMINATED BY NATURAL RESOURCES? WE INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION USING THREE DATASETS FOR RUSSIA'S BILATERAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR GOODS, SERVICES AND INVESTMENT AT DISAGGREGATED LEVEL WITH ITS PARTNER COUNTRIES OVER THE WORLD. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE DETERIORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA SINCE 2003 HAS AFFECTED THE LONG-RUN TRADE PERFORMANCE OF RUSSIA IN SOPHISTICATED AND TECHNOLOGY-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURED GOODS, AS WELL AS ITS INWARD INVESTMENTS WITH ADVANCED ECONOMIES. IT IS PRECISELY THIS TYPE OF TRADE THAT RUSSIA SHOULD NURTURE TO DIVERSIFY AWAY FROM HYDROCARBONS EXPORT DEPENDENCE. OUR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWS THAT RUSSIA REMAINS TO A LARGE EXTENT AN OUTLIER WITHIN THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. IT EXPORTS DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS TO PARTNER COUNTRIES WHICH ARE OR HAD BECOME MEMBERS OF THE WTO OVER OUR PERIOD OF ANALYSIS. RUSSIA'S TRADE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE ACCESSION OF THESE COUNTRIES TO THE WTO. RUSSIA ITSELF FINALLY ACCEDED TO THE WTO IN JULY 2012 AMIDST SIGNS OF A MODEST IMPROVEMENT OF ITS RULE-OF-LAW INDICATORS.
96	FROM THE EARLY YEARS OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX TO THE PRESENT, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS ENGAGED IN WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED "CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS" FROM THE DICTATES OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, ALWAYS IN A TAXPAYER-FAVORABLE DIRECTION. A PROMINENT CURRENT EXAMPLE IS THE IRS'S "DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL" POLICY WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEE-RETAINED FREQUENT FLIER MILES; IN A 2002 ANNOUNCEMENT (WHICH, AS OF 2012, IS STILL IN FORCE), THE IRS INDICATED THAT SUCH MILES WERE TECHNICALLY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF GROSS INCOME, BUT THAT THE IRS HAD NO INTENTION OF ENFORCING THE LAW. THIS ESSAY DESCRIBES AND EVALUATES THE PHENOMENON OF ADMINISTRATIVELY-CREATED CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS FROM THE CODE. AFTER DEFINING THE CONCEPT OF CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS AND EXPLAINING WHY SUCH DEVIATIONS ARE SOMETIMES ATTRACTIVE TO TAX ADMINISTRATORS, THE ESSAY OFFERS A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY OF CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS, PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE PRE-1984 TREATMENT OF A MISCELLANY OF FRINGE BENEFITS OF EMPLOYMENT, AND TO A SPATE OF RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THE IRS WOULD NOT ENFORCE THE CODE'S ANTI-LOSS-TRAFFICKING RULES IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS. THE ESSAY ALSO EXPLAINS HOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS HAS DEPENDED ON THE ABSENCE OF THIRD-PARTY STANDING IN TAX LITIGATION, AND HOW THE LACK OF ANY JUDICIAL CHECK ON UNAUTHORIZED GIVEAWAYS BY TAX ADMINISTRATORS THREATENS RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. IT CONCLUDES WITH A PROPOSAL FOR LEGISLATION AIMED AT RETAINING THE PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF CUSTOMARY DEVIATIONS WHILE ASSUAGING RULE-OF-LAW CONCERNS.
97	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES LOCAL CONTESTATION AGAINST THE EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX), MANIFESTING ITSELF IN LOCAL ACTORS PUBLICLY DEMANDING A CHANGE IN THE MISSION'S MANDATE AND/OR ITS OPERATIONS. THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW EULEX'S ACTIONS AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS ARE PERCEIVED AND REACTED UPON BY THE LOCAL ACTORS. IT SHOWS THAT LOCAL CONTESTATION IS MAINLY FUELED BY (1) CONFLICTING SOVEREIGNTY CLAIMS BY THE MAJORITY ALBANIANS AND THE MINORITY SERBS; (2) THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOVEREIGNTY BY PARTS OF SOCIETY AS ENTAILING EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY; AND (3) DISSATISFACTION WITH THE MISSION'S EFFECTIVENESS. BY ADDRESSING EULEX FROM A BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVE-THAT OF THE LOCAL ACTORS-THE ARTICLE UNDERLINES THE LIMITATIONS OF EU POLICIES IN POST-CONFLICT KOSOVO.
98	THERE IS CURRENTLY A WIDESPREAD VIEW THAT THE EU IS IN CRISIS. THIS CRISIS IS NOT ONLY FINANCIAL, BUT, MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT TOUCHES UPON THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE UNION AS SET OUT IN ARTICLE 2 TEU AMONG THEM, A PRINCIPLE THAT HAS SERVED AS THE CORNERSTONE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION ALREADY FROM ITS EARLY STAGES SEEMS PARTICULARLY THREATENED: THE RULE OF LAW. DUE TO ENDEMIC CORRUPTION, WEAK INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES, OR INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR JUDICIAL LEVELS, SOME EU MEMBER STATES PRESENT SO GRAVE DEFICIENCIES IN GUARANTEEING THE RULE OF LAW THAT THEIR CONFORMITY WITH BASIC EU STANDARDS IS SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED. ALTHOUGH IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE EU CANNOT STAY INACTIVE IN THE FACE OF SUCH GRAVE DEFICIENCIES, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW POTENTIAL RESPONSES FIT WITH THE OVERALL EU CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DISCUSSION BY DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCY IN THE RULE OF LAW.
99	JOE MA'S LAWYER, LAWYER, A FILM ABOUT A LAWYER'S ATTEMPT TO RESCUE HIS FORMER SERVANT FROM A FALSE ACCUSATION OF MURDER IN THE COLONIAL COURTS OF HONG KONG, WAS RELEASED IN 1997, THE PIVOTAL YEAR OF HONG KONG'S RETROCESSION TO CHINA AND A TIME WHEN ANXIETIES ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW WERE VERY MUCH IN THE AIR. A QUINTESSENTIALLY 'HONG KONG' MOVIE, IT CASTS THE COMEDIAN STEPHEN CHAU-ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC FIGURES IN HONG KONG CINEMA - AS THE LAWYER. THE FILM'S BOX-OFFICE SUCCESS CAN TO A GREAT EXTENT BE TRACED TO ITS CLEVER USE OF PUNS AND CONVENTIONS IN CANTONESE, THE DIALECT SPOKEN IN HONG KONG. MOREOVER, AS A FILM WITH A SPECIFICALLY LEGAL FOCUS, IT RESONATED WITH AUDIENCES BY RAISING RELEVANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGAL CONSTRUCTION OF HONG KONG IDENTITY, THE PLACE OF ENGLISH LAW IN A FORMER COLONY, AND THE FUTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CITY AFTER ITS RETURN TO CHINA. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A DIALOGUE BETWEEN LAW AND FILM BY ARGUING THAT LAWYER LAWYER CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A POST-COLONIAL CRITIQUE OF THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT WILL TAKE THE WORK OF THE ENGLISH JURIST ALBERT VENN DICEY AS ITS FOCUS, FOR DICEY'S SEMINAL WRITINGS ON THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION IS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE KEY TO THE POPULARISATION OF THE TERM 'RULEOF LAW' IN THE COMMON LAW WORLD. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE BUILDS ON THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON 'LAW AND FILM' STUDIES, ESPECIALLY WORKS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL THEORY AND FILM STUDIES, AND EXTENDS THEIR FRAME OF ANALYSIS TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE GENRE OF FILM RESPONDS TO THE DISSEMINATION OF ENGLISH CONSTITUTIONAL IDEAS TO FORMER COLONIES IN EAST ASIA.
100	AS THE WORLD CONDEMNS THE GENOCIDE, MYANMAR AND DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI'S GOVERNMENT DENIED IT AND REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT AND ARGUED THAT IT SANCTIONED UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER PROBLEMATISES THESE QUESTIONS:, WHAT IS THE RULE OF LAW IN MYANMAR? AND WHY DO THEY DENY IT? THIS STUDY IS QUALITATIVE IN WHICH PAGES OF TRANSCRIPTS OF SPEECHES PERUSED TO FIND THEMES, SETTINGS, AND MEANINGS ATTRIBUTED TO PROBLEMATISING DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI AND THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-COLONIAL MYANMAR. THESE SPEECHES DELIVERED IN PUBLIC FROM 2016-2018. IN ANALYSING HER SPEECHES, THE PAPER USES FOUCAULDIAN DISCOURSE ANALYSIS. ON THE PART OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI, IT FOUND THAT PROBLEMATISING HER ACTIONS AND SILENCE OVER THE ROHINGYA GENOCIDE INFLUENCED HER LATE FATHER'S ROLE. SHE CONTINUED TO CLAIM THAT HER MILITARY FATHER IS THE FATHER OF THE BURMESE MILITARY. SHE HAD SPECIAL RELATIONS IN INCARCERATION WITH THE ARMY GENERALS DURING HER HOUSE ARREST. SHE FOCUSED ON THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION WHICH SHE PROMISED IN THE 2015 ELECTION. THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT THIS RULE OF LAW HAS PURELY POLITICAL NARRATIVES BECAUSE THE GENERALS ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE. THIS PAPER SUBSUMES ONGOING LEGAL REFORMS IN MYANMAR.
101	A UNIQUE FEATURE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS IN CHINA IS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANS HAVE ENJOYED A NEAR MONOPOLY STATUS IN INTERPRETING RULES. THE HIGH CENTRALIZATION OF POWERS COMBINED WITH THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE CHECKS LEADS TO PROBLEMS WHICH IN TURN JEOPARDIZE THE LEGITIMACY OF INTERPRETATIONS MADE BY ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANS. IN THE SHORT RUN, WHILE THIS MONOPOLY STATUS WILL NOT BE CHANGED FUNDAMENTALLY, THE PROBLEMS MAY BE ALLEVIATED THROUGH THE "SELF-CONSTRAINTS" ADOPTED WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND APPLIED IN ORDER TO COMPLY, MORE EFFECTIVELY, WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE "RULE OF LAW". MEANWHILE, EXTERNAL FACTORS ARE PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAW, INCLUDING THE SUPERVISION FROM CIVILIANS, TAX PROFESSIONALS AND NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL TAX COMMUNITY.
102	SOMETIMES SECRECY IN LAW IS REQUIRED TO PROTECT VULNERABLE WITNESSES OR SUPPRESS SENSITIVE EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE TERROR ATTACKS OF 11 SEPTEMBER 2001, GOVERNMENTS IN LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES HAVE INCREASED SECRECY AND THE USE OF CLANDESTINE PROCEDURES UNDER THE PRETEXT OF SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SECURITY. IN MANY INSTANCES, THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ERODED CIVIL LIBERTIES, INFRINGED UPON CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES, AND HAD NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS HAVE ONLY LIMITED CONSTITUTIONAL EXPRESSION, IT IS HOPED THE DOCTRINE OF REPRESENTATIVE AND RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT WILL ACT AS SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. CONVERSELY, DRAWING ON EXAMPLES RANGING FROM THE REGULATION OF IMMIGRATION TO THE CONTROL OF SERIOUS ORGANISED CRIME, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT ESCALATING SECRECY IN THE CURRENT ERA HAS A CORRUPTING EFFECT ON DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE RULE OF LAW.
103	THE STATE HAS BECAME ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE POLITICAL STORY AND AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT FOR SOCIAL AND REGIONAL INTEGRATION IN TO SAFEGUARD FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, IN ADDITION TO A LEGAL RESTRICTION OF POWER ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW. NATIONAL STATE IS IN CRISIS AS A RESULT OF GLOBALIZATION, THE PROBLEMS SCALE AND THE NEW LEADING RULE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME SUPRANATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THIS NEW INTERNATIONAL JURIDICAL ORDER, WILL HAVE TO FACE UP TO PRINCIPLES, WARRANTIES AND VALUES OF A DEMOCRACY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS THE POINT IN WHICH WE CONSIDER. WHY THIS DEBATE ABOUT EUROPEAN AND LATIN AMERICA IS SO IMPORTANT.
104	EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC SECTOR DECISION MAKERS ARE COGNITIVELY BIASED. SUCH BIASES CAN LEAD TO POOR PUBLIC POLICY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE TRADITIONAL FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN DEBIAS DECISION MAKERS. IN PARTICULAR, I CLAIM THAT GENERAL ABSTRACT RULES ERODE MANY BIASES. CONSTRUAL LEVEL THEORY IS USED TO SUPPORT THIS CLAIM.
105	PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO, INDONESIA'S FIRST DIRECTLY ELECTED PRESIDENT, WAS SWEPT INTO OFFICE ON A WAVE OF POPULAR SUPPORT, BUT WAS FACED WITH A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF CHALLENGES, EACH DEMANDING A PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. AMONG THE MOST IMMEDIATELY PRESSING, CALLING FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT, WERE: FIRST, THE NEED TO ASSERT POLITICAL CONTROL AND TO BUILD AN EFFECTIVE POLITICAL COALITION; SECOND, THE NEED TO SECURE GRASS-ROOTS DEMOCRACY BY ENSURING THAT REGIONAL ELECTIONS WERE EFFECTIVELY CARRIED OUT; THIRD, THE NEED TO COPE WITH THE ACEH TSUNAMI CRISIS AND ACHIEVE A PEACEFUL RECONCILIATION WITH THE FREE ACEH MOVEMENT; AND FOURTH, THE NEED TO RESOLVE A SERIES OF SOCIOECONOMIC POLICY 'GROWTH VERSUS EQUITY' DILEMMAS, TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTORS TO STIMULATE EXPORT-LED GROWTH, WHILE SECURING BASIC NEEDS AND ANTI-POVERTY SOCIAL PROGRAMMES. AFTER BRIEFLY NOTING HOW YUDHOYONO AND HIS ADMINISTRATION RESPONDED TO THESE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS DURING ITS FIRST 20 MONTHS IN OFFICE (TO JUNE 2006), THE PAPER THEN DISCUSSES AT GREATER LENGTH THREE MORE FUNDAMENTAL AND INTRACTABLE SETS OF PROBLEMS, NAMELY, THE URGENT NEED TO IMPLEMENT JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, AND TO LAUNCH A WIDE-RANGING ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN; THE NEED TO CONFRONT THE RESURGENCE OF MILITANT ISLAMIC TERRORISM, BOTH INTER-COMMUNAL AND AL-QAEDA-INSPIRED, AND TO MOUNT A ROBUST ANTI-TERRORIST CAMPAIGN; AND FINALLY THE INTENSE AND CONVOLUTED PROBLEM OF INTER-SECTARIAN ANIMOSITIES, AND THE CLASH OF RELIGIOUS VERSUS SECULAR VALUES, THE RECONCILIATION OF WHICH WILL BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO SECURING SOCIAL STABILITY, DEMOCRATIC PLURALISM, NATIONAL UNITY AND INDONESIA'S FUTURITY.
106	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR AN INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH TO CRIMINALISATION SCHOLARSHIP, DRAWING ON HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE METHODOLOGIES, AND ON THE RESOURCES OF SEVERAL DISCIPLINES INCLUDING LAW, SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE. IT GOES ON TO SKETCH THE SORT OF RESEARCH AGENDA WHICH IS IMPLIED BY THAT APPROACH, WITH A VIEW TO LAYING THE INTELLECTUAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR A BROAD POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CRIMINALISATION WITHIN MODERN SOCIETIES COMMITTED TO THE RECHSSTAAT/RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW THIS FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED OUT OF RECENT WORK IN THE APPARENTLY DISCRETE FIELDS OF HISTORICAL AND OF COMPARATIVE STUDIES, OF DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS OF CRIMINAL LAW, AND OF SOCIO-POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT IN MODERN SOCIETIES. THE MAIN OUTLINES OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SET OUT IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE, WHICH THEN MOVES ON TO CONSIDER HOW THEY MAY BE BROUGHT INTO DIALOGUE SO AS TO INFORM THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FURTHER RESEARCH AGENDA. THIS AGENDA, WHICH SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BUILDING OF A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLACE OF CRIMINALISATION AND PUNISHMENT WITHIN THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF SOCIAL ORDER WHICH SHARE A COMMITMENT TO RECHTSSTAAT/RULE OF LAW IDEALS, IS SKETCHED IN THE THIRD PART OF THE PAPER. IN CONCLUSION, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH A RESEARCH AGENDA IMPLIES AN EXPANSIVE CONCEPTION OF PUNISHMENT AND SOCIETY SCHOLARSHIP.
107	THE RULE OF LAW IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN COUNTRIES UNDERGOING TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIANISM TO DEMOCRACY. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, ONE THAT IS IMPARTIAL AND INSULAR. IN EASTERN EUROPE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION HAS PRODUCED TWO MODELS OF JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION: JUDICIAL SELF-MANAGEMENT AND THE EXECUTIVE MODEL. ROMANIA IS A CASE OF THE FORMER, THE CZECH REPUBLIC AN INSTANCE OF THE LATTER. COMPARISON OF THE TWO CASES SUGGESTS THAT WHILE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PRESERVATION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE ORGANISATION OF THE JUDICIARY ARE IN A RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP. THE ORGANISATION OF THE JUDICIARY IS NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHICH IN TURN GUARDS AGAINST THE POLITICISATION OF JUDICIAL MANAGEMENT, WITH ITS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND ULTIMATELY THE RULE OF LAW.

108	THE BOLIVIAN PRESIDENCY IS A PRECARIOUS POSITION, NOT ONLY BECAUSE SO MANY PRESIDENTS HAVE LEFT OFFICE UNDER DURESS, BUT BECAUSE FORMER PRESIDENTS ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL JEOPARDY. THE CASE OF EDUARDO RODRIGUEZ VELTZE ILLUSTRATES THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN BOLIVIA AND THE POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS THAT SUSTAIN IT. RODRIGUEZ WAS A RESPECTED CHIEF JUSTICE OF BOLIVIA'S SUPREME COURT. HE RELUCTANTLY ASSUMED THE PRESIDENCY DURING A POLITICAL CRISIS AND SHEPHERDED THE COUNTRY THROUGH PEACEFUL ELECTIONS IN 2005 THAT BROUGHT EVO MORALES TO THE PRESIDENCY. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CHARGED WITH TREASON IN A CASE THAT INVOLVED THE TRANSFER FROM THE BOLIVIAN MILITARY TO THE UNITED STATES OF SOME OBSOLETE SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES. THE RODRIGUEZ CASE WAS POLITICALLY IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL FOR THE MORALES GOVERNMENT, BUT ONLY BRIEFLY, AND THE MOMENT PASSED. NOW, THE CASE'S OBSCURITY AND THE FECKLESSNESS OF THE BOLIVIAN COURTS HAVE LEFT RODRIGUEZ IN LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIMBO. FULL DISCLOSURE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REGARDING ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE MISSILES CASE MIGHT CLEAR RODRIGUEZ'S NAME.
109	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY ANALYSES A SET OF WAR CRIMES TRIALS, CONDUCTED BY THE BRITISH COLONIAL AUTHORITIES IN POST-WORLD WAR II SINGAPORE, WHICH DEALT, AMONG OTHERS, WITH THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF DESERTING BRITISH INDIAN ARMY SOLDIERS. WHILE SEEMINGLY OBSCURE, THESE TRIALS ILLUMINATE IMPORTANT LESSONS ABOUT RULE OF LAW DYNAMICS IN WAR CRIMES TRIALS. ALTHOUGH THESE TRIALS WERE INTENDED BY THEIR ORGANIZERS TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF BRITISH COLONIAL RULE, THEY RESULTED IN UNEXPECTED ACQUITTALS AND CONVICTION NON-CONFIRMATIONS. ON THE ONE HAND, BY APPLYING BRITISH MILITARY LAW AS A BACK-UP SOURCE OF LAW WHEN PROSECUTING 'VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS AND USAGES OF WAR', THE BRITISH CONTRAVENED THE RULE OF LAW BY RETROSPECTIVELY SUBJECTING THE JAPANESE DEFENCE TO UNFAMILIAR LEGAL STANDARDS. ON THE OTHER HAND, BY BINDING THEMSELVES TO A PRE-EXISTING AND RELATIVELY CLEAR SOURCE OF LAW, THE BRITISH WERE CONSTRAINED BY THE RULE OF LAW EVEN AS THIS EMPOWERED THE JAPANESE DEFENCE. THESE FINDINGS SPEAK TO BROADER DEBATES ON THE CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, BY PROVOCATIVELY SUGGESTING THAT, FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE, WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IN A BODY OF LAW IS ITS CLARITY, ACCESSIBILITY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS RATHER THAN ITS SOURCE OR ITS PURPORTED 'UNIVERSALITY'.
110	IN CASE WHEN THE CRITERIA FOR THE VALIDITY OF INTERPRETATIVE DIRECTIVES ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED AND A POLITICAL DISPUTE ARISES, THE DISPUTE PARTICIPANT MAY REFER TO SUCH INTERPRETATIVE DIRECTIVES, THE USE OF WHICH WILL DETERMINE THE CONTENT OF THE LAW AND DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THE POLITICAL DISPUTE. IN THIS WAY A CRISIS OF THE LEGAL ORDER IN POLAND HAS OCCURRED. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE UNDEFINED STATUS OF THE DIRECTIVES OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION, THE RESULTING NEED FOR LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW, THE ROLE OF LEGAL VIEWS (LEGAL DOCTRINE) POSSIBLE IN THIS RESPECT AND THE VALIDATION ROLE OF THE INTERPRETATION CUSTOM IN LEGAL DOCTRINE. THE ARTICLE CONSISTS OF FOUR PARTS. THE FIRST ONE DESCRIBES THE PHENOMENA THAT HAVE DISRUPTED THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO THE SOURCES OF LAW. THE SECOND PART DESCRIBES THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO THE SOURCES OF THE LAW. THE THIRD ONE PROVES THAT THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO THE SOURCES OF LAW, IN WHICH THE MAIN ROLE IS FULFILLED BY NORMATIVE ACTS, IS INCORRECT, THIS PART ALSO INDICATES THAT THE KEY ROLE IN THIS RESPECT IS PLAYED BY SPONTANEOUS RULES OF LAW INTERPRETATION. THE FOURTH PART INDICATES THE NEED TO LEGITIMIZE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERPRETATION CUSTOM IN JUDICIAL DOCTRINE. THE RESEARCH MATERIAL INCLUDES PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE IN POLAND, PRACTICE OF LAW INTERPRETATION AND SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON LAW INTERPRETATION. THE RESEARCH MATERIAL WAS EXAMINED MAINLY USING THE METHOD OF LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS.
111	THERE IS A LONG-STANDING DEBATE IN THE LITERATURE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRENGTHENING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER EXPLOITS A RECENT CHINESE JUDICIAL REFORM IN ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION, WHICH CHANGED THE JURISDICTION RULE FROM INTRA-REGIONAL TO TRANSREGIONAL, TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF IMPROVED JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ON PROTECTING PRIVATE ENTITIES AGAINST POTENTIAL ABUSES OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY. WE FIND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFULLY SUING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AFTER THE REFORM, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DEFENDANTS ARE MORE POWERFUL GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND WHEN THE PLAINTIFFS ARE INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS WITH FEWER LEGAL RESOURCES THAN FIRMS. BUT THIS EFFECT IS MORE LIMITED FOR HIGHER-LEVEL GOVERNMENTS. THE REFORM ALSO RESULTS IN INCREASED CASE FILINGS, PROLONGED TRIAL TIME, AND ENHANCED JUDICIAL QUALITY. IN ADDITION, IT RAISES THE AWARENESS OF BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND CITIZENS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, INCREASES FIRM ENTRY, AND WORSENS GENERAL PUBLIC ATTITUDES TOWARD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS TRANS-REGIONAL JURISDICTION AS A NEW SOURCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN A PARTY STATE AND ITS POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS. (C) 2023 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
112	ANTILIBERAL CONCEPTS CALLING THE RULE OF LAW INTO QUESTION HAVE AN EASY JOB WITH FORMER LEFTISTS, FOR IN THOSE CIRCLES NORMATIVE UNIVERSALS HAVE NEVER BEEN ESTEEMED. HOWEVER, AS EXPERIENCE IN GERMANY IN THE PAST TWO CENTURIES REVEALS, AN ELEMENT OF NATURAL LAW THAT LIES WITHIN MARXISM - A HUMANITARIAN NORMATIVE ELEMENT ENCOMPASSING THE IDEAS OF EQUALITY, FREEDOM, AND JUSTICE - SHOULD AND MUST BE PRESERVED.
113	THE THIRD WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY TWO INNOVATIVE THEORETICAL CLAIMS THAT PROCEDURAL REGIME ATTRIBUTES HAVE SYSTEMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES UNDER DEMOCRACY AND AUTHORITARIANISM. MANY "RULE OF LAW" CLAIMS ASSOCIATE DEMOCRACY WITH LOWER RISKS AND GREATER PREDICTABILITY OVER OUTCOMES THAN AUTHORITARIANISM. THE "INSTITUTIONALIZED UNCERTAINTY" CLAIM EXPECTS NEARLY THE OPPOSITE PATTERN. EACH HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIME SUPPORT AND THUS FOR REGIME (IN)STABILITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT NEITHER APPROACH EFFECTIVELY CAPTURES GLOBAL PATTERNS OF RISK AND PREDICTABILITY. A RECONSIDERATION SHOWS THAT BOTH APPROACHES MISCHARACTERIZE BOTH REGIME TYPES. PREDICTABILITY IS SHOWN TO VARY AT LEAST AS MUCH ACROSS AS BETWEEN THE TWO REGIME TYPES. THIS IS THE RESULT OF FACTORS EXOGENOUS TO PROCEDURES, SUCH AS STRUCTURES OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC CONFLICT. AS A RESULT, THESE STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS, RATHER THAN REGIME FEATURES ALONE, EXPLAIN OUTCOMES SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC INSTABILITY AND CONSOLIDATION. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THIS IS THE CASE.
114	MARY KALDOR'S RECENT WORK ON SECURITY CULTURES IS ROOTED IN A PUZZLE: IF THE TERM SECURITY IS BY ITS VERY NATURE COMPLEX AND AMBIGUOUS, WHY DO WE KEEP DOING THE SAME THINGS AND MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES? HER ANSWER: SECURITY CULTURES, OR SHARED STYLES OF DOING SECURITY. SHE ARGUES THAT WE NEED TO FIND 'NODAL POINTS'AEURO"OR EXPERTS IN THEIR CONTEXT-AND DISRUPT THEIR WAY OF OPERATING THROUGH 'SECURITY EXPERIMENTS'. THIS REFLECTS RECENT ARGUMENTS IN MY FIELD OF RULE OF LAW REFORM AND ELSEWHERE. DRAWING ON THESE ARGUMENTS, MY EXPERIENCES OF RULE OF LAW REFORM AND THEORY FROM THE SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE, I ASK WHETHER KALDOR'S CALL FOR SECURITY EXPERIMENTS MAY ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPRODUCTION OF THE SAME MISTAKES. I ARGUE THAT THE INDETERMINACY OF THE CORE IDEA DISTINGUISHES FIELDS SUCH AS RULE OF LAW REFORM AND SECURITY. IT ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THEM, AS ANY STATEMENT THAT ORDERS THESE FIELDS IS SUBJECT TO BEING CAPTURED BY EXPERTS AND MOBILIZED AS A RESOURCE IN THEIR CONTESTS. I THEN LOOK AT THE TRAINING CURRICULUM OF THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN MALTA TO EXPLORE HOW EXPERIMENTATION MIGHT BE CONSERVATIVE, RATHER THAN DISRUPTIVE, ARGUING THAT EXPERTS MAY INOCULATE THEMSELVES AGAINST CRITIQUE BY USING THE SOPHISTICATED RHETORIC OF EXPERIMENTS, WHILE HIDING THEIR AGENCY AND DECISIONS BEHIND THE VENEER OF BEING RESPONSIVE.
115	THE AUTHOR WORRIES THAT THE RULE OF LAW WAS DIMINISHED WHEN PARLIAMENT RE-ENACTED SECTION 213(1.1) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE. THIS "OFFENCE" IS A REFURBISHED VERSION OF THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROHIBITION AGAINST COMMUNICATING IN PUBLIC FOR PROSTITUTION, WHICH WAS INVALIDATED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN 2013. ON ITS FACE, SECTION 213(1.1) APPEARS TO CREATE AN OFFENCE TO OFFER SEXUAL SERVICES NEAR SELECT PUBLIC PLACES WHERE MINORS MIGHT BE PRESENT. BUT ON THE GROUND, SECTION 213(1.1) IS NOT ACTUALLY OPERATING AS AN OFFENCE AT ALL - AT LEAST ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT POLITICIANS RESPONSIBLE FOR PASSING SECTION 213(1.1) INTO LAW AND POLICE OFFICERS WHO LOBBIED FOR ITS RE-ENACTMENT. BY DELVING INTO THE LAWMAKING PROCESS, THE AUTHOR DISCOVERS EVIDENCE THAT SECTION 213(1.1) WAS INSTEAD RE-ENACTED TO OPERATE AS A WARRANTLESS DETENTION POWER. IF THE DEBATE BETWEEN LEGISLATORS AND POLICE IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY, DE FACTO DETENTION UNDER SECTION 213(1.1) APPEARS TO SERVE AS A MEANS TO TWO ENDS: (1) TO EXTRICATE PEOPLE WHO SELL SEX OUT OF THE INDUSTRY; AND (2) TO COLLECT EVIDENCE OF GRAVER OFFENCES BY PIMPS AND JOHNS. NEITHER OF THESE TWO ENDS INVOLVE CHARGING THE CITIZENS WHO ARE TECHNICALLY CRIMINALIZED UNDER SECTION 213(1.1), YET WHO ARE OTHERWISE CLOAKED IN MORAL BLAMELESSNESS BY LEGISLATORS AND POLICE. DESPITE THE BENEVOLENT MOTIVES OF LEGISLATORS AND POLICE, THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES FOUR INTERCONNECTED RULE OF LAW PROBLEMS WITH DE FACTO DETENTIONS UNDER SECTION 213(1.1): UNACCOUNTABILITY TO LAW, MISALLOCATION OF POWER, UNANSWERABILITY TO CITIZENS, AND INACCESSIBILITY TO JUSTICE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT DISTORTING A CRIMINAL OFFENCE INTO A DE FACTO DETENTION POWER DEPRIVES PEOPLE NOT ONLY OF CONSTRAINED CHOICES, BUT ALSO OF VITAL PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS, WITHOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT SEEK THE ANSWERS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND JUSTICE THAT EVERYONE DESERVES.
116	THE REALITY OF RECENT YEARS HAS SHOWN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE CONSCIOUSLY SEEKING TO UNDERMINE SYSTEMATICALLY UNION'S KEY VALUES. IT IS THEN THAT WE HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE INADEQUACIES OF ART. 7 TEU TO ADDRESS SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES AGAINST THESE VALUES, ALLOWING FOR AN UNFORTUNATE IMPASSE IN THE COUNCIL. HOWEVER, SINCE THE END OF 2017, A SERIES OF FUNDAMENTAL JUDGEMENTS HAVE REVEALED THE ECJ'S FIRM WILL TO ACT AS GUARDIAN OF THE ORTHODOXY OF THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IN ORDER TO PROTECT AT LEAST JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE MEMBER STATES. IN THIS CONTEXT, INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURES THROUGH THE ACCELERATED PROCEDURE AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE INTERIM MEASURE OF SUSPENSION UNDER THE WARNING OF LARGE FINES HAVE PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF REACTING TO THIS CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW. ALSO BEFORE THE UNION ITSELF, THE COURT OF JUSTICE TRIES TO MAKE PREVAIL THE DIFFERENT PROFILES OF THE RULE OF LAW, ALTHOUGH IN SOME AREAS THE BALANCE IS UNCONVINCING. AS LONG AS THIS CONTINUES, THERE IS CERTAINLY A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE UNION'S CONTROL OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW BY ITSELF AND THE OPPOSITE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ITS MEMBER STATES.
117	THIS PAPER SEEKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE TENSION BETWEEN IMPLEMENTING LAW AND ORDER AND RESPECTING RULE OF LAW IN FRENCH FOOTBALL STADIUMS. IT SHOWS THAT, DUE TO LOW FOOTBALL CROWD DISORDER AND TO GOVERNMENT FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED SUBURBS AS KEY LOCI OF SOCIAL UNREST, FRENCH COUNTER-HOOLIGANISM REMAINED UNTIL RECENTLY EVENT-LINKED RATHER THAN EMBEDDED IN A GLOBAL STRATEGY. PRESENT LEGAL PROVISIONS AND POLICE MEASURES ARE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES, THEREBY LEADING TO MANY DIFFERENT CONFUSIONS IN TERMS OF VALUE RANKING, OBJECTIVES TO BE REACHED, AND MEANS TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES.
118	LINKS AMONG COMPLIANCE, RULE OF LAW, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE ESSENTIAL AND INDIVISIBLE, ALTHOUGH NOT SUFFICIENT ALONE TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS CAN BE IMPROVED BY UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING THE TWO MAIN THEORETICAL APPROACHES: LOGIC OF CONSEQUENCES, AND LOGIC OF APPROPRIATENESS. COMPLIANCE CAN BE IMPROVED MORE BY COMBINING THE TWO APPROACHES. FURTHER WORK TO DISAGGREGATE BOTH THE STATE AND THE FIRM, AND TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF BIASES, HEURISTICS, AND FRAMING IN ACTOR'S COMPLIANCE CALCULATIONS, REMAINS TO BE DONE AND PROMISES IMPORTANT INSIGHTS.
119	THIS ARTICLE IS AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE POLITICAL STYLE OF THE ROMANIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PSD), WHICH, DESPITE BEING A MAINSTREAM CENTER-LEFT PARTY, HAS SHIFTED FROM A LATENT TO A CRYSTALIZED POPULIST RHETORIC. USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF PARTY SPEECHES AND PRESS STATEMENTS FROM 2015-2019, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE POLITICAL STYLE OF THE PARTY BECAME MORE POPULIST AS THE DOMESTIC JUSTICE SYSTEM BEGAN TO PRESSURE LEADING PSD POLITICIANS. THE DATA REVEAL AN INTERSECTION BETWEEN POPULIST RHETORIC AND INSTITUTIONALIST DISCOURSE WHEN THE PSD WAS TRYING TO AMEND THE RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS.
120	'RULE BY MEDIA' IS A TRANSLATION OF THE CHINESE WORDS MEIZHI'. ALTHOUGH COMMENTATORS HAVE GIVEN DIFFERENT MEANINGS TO THE EXPRESSION, IN THIS PAPER THE TERM MEANS THAT THE MEDIA IS CAPABLE OF HELPING TO RESOLVE CERTAIN SOCIAL ISSUES EFFECTIVELY THROUGH PUBLIC EXPOSURE. CHINA IS IN A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS MARKED BY THE UNIQUE 'CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS'. ANTI-CORRUPTION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF RULE OF LAW. THE CHINESE MEDIA, WHICH IS MAINLY CONTROLLED BY THE STATE, HAS PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CRACKING DOWN ON CORRUPTION IN RECENT YEARS. CAN A STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA PLAY AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN ANTI-CORRUPTION CASES? CAN THE PRESENT CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PART SUCCEED IN ITS PURSUIT TO RULE OF LAW THROUGH CONTROLLED EXPOSURE OF CORRUPTION, WHILE MAINTAINING ITS PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM? THESE ARE THE ISSUES TO BE EXAMINED IN THE PAPER. THE AUTHOR IS OF A VIEW THAT THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY APPEARS TO FOLLOW THE CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY OF SELF-RESTRAINT AND SELF-PURIFICATION, WHICH CLAIMS THAT A PERSON SHALL IMPROVE HIMSELF BY CULTIVATING HIS INTERNAL BODY AND SPIRIT AS WELL AS NOURISHING HIS MORAL CHARACTERISTICS, IN ITS EFFORT TO MOVE TO RULE OF LAW WITH 'CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS'. IT IS YET TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY LEAD TO THE CREATION OF A WORKABLE POLITICAL SYSTEM DIFFERENT FROM THE WESTERN MODEL OF RULE OF LAW. CRACKING DOWN ON CORRUPTION IN ANY CASE IS ALWAYS A POSITIVE STEP FOR CHINA TO MOVE TO A SOCIETY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
121	THIS ARTICLE TURNS UPSIDE DOWN THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM OF "LEARNING EFFECTS", WHICH SUGGESTS THAT WHEN LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TRADE WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, MORE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES AND THOSE WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW, THE LESS-DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WILL GRADUALLY DEMOCRATISE AND ADOPT AND IMPROVE THEIR DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW. IT EXPLORES WHETHER CLOSER ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH CHINA, AN UNDEMOCRATIC COUNTRY WITH POOR RULE OF LAW, WOULD UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG. BY EXAMINING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS (FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS, FREE PROVISION OF SERVICES, FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND FREE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS) AND THE WORLD BANK GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND THE PRESS FREEDOM INDEXES OF FREEDOM HOUSE AND REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS, THIS ARTICLE FINDS, GENERALLY, THAT CLOSER ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH CHINA UNDERMINES PRESS FREEDOM IN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG AND THAT TRADE DEPENDENCE ON CHINA FOR SERVICES IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO HONG KONG'S PERFORMANCE IN THE GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS.
122	THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SPECIAL ISSUE, AND THE BOOKS TO WHICH THEY RELATE, ARE PREMISED ON THE IDEA THAT THE RULE OF LAW RELATES TO PRIVATE RELATIONSHIPS. I CHALLENGE THAT IDEA. BY EXPLORING SOLELY THEORETICAL IDEAS, I ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW - AS IT IS USUALLY DEFINED - DOES NOT RELATE TO PRIVATE RELATIONSHIPS AND, IN CONSEQUENCE, THE NEXUS NECESSARY TO INVOKE A RULE OF LAW-SOLUTION IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OUTLINED IN THE BOOKS IS ABSENT.
123	PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF LAWYERS HAS BEEN SHAPED AS A MULTIPLE ETHICS, THUS MAKING DIFFICULT TO SHOW THE UNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND ITS COMMON MORAL ORIENTATION. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS A UNITARY RECONSTRUCTION OF LEGAL ETHICS RESTING ON THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL KINDS OF LAWYERS.
124	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT INTERNATIONALLY ENDORSED PEACE AGREEMENTS ENTRENCH THE RESTRUCTURING OF POWER RELATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN 'NEW WARS'. IT CHARACTERIZES NEW WARS AS 'MUTUAL ENTERPRISES' IN WHICH NETWORKS OF STATE AND NONSTATE ACTORS ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE FOR ECONOMIC AND/OR POLITICAL GAIN. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE WAY IN WHICH SUCH NETWORKS SUBVERT EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT A RULE OF LAW, PRIMARILY USING THE EXAMPLE OF BOSNIA. IT ARGUES THAT EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE SUCH NETWORKS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS OR DEMOCRATIC POLITICS FACE HUGE OBSTACLES. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN AMBIGUOUS, SOMETIMES GOING WITH THE GRAIN OF EXISTING POWER RELATIONS FOR GEO-POLITICAL REASONS OR FOR STABILITY AND SOMETIMES UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS. ONLY WHERE GRASS ROOTS ACTORS HAVE DIRECTLY ACCESSED INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS OR WHERE LOCAL ACTIVISTS HAVE WORKED WITH MUNICIPALITIES HAVE THERE BEEN SOME OPENINGS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING WHAT A 'NEW PEACE' MIGHT INVOLVE.
125	IN A CONCURRING JUDGMENT IN THOMAS V MOWBRAY, A HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA CASE TURNING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF TERRORISM-RELATED CONTROL ORDERS, CALLINAN J OFFERS A RE-EVALUATION OF THE COURT'S EARLIER DECISION IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CASE TO CURTAIL EXECUTIVE POWER. ACCORDING TO CALLINAN J, FACTUAL MATTERS KNOWABLE (BUT NOT KNOWN) AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIER DECISION MIGHT HAVE GIVEN RISE TO A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. IN A DISSENTING JUDGMENT BY KIRBY J IN THE SAME CASE THE COURT'S REASONING IN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CASE IS ROBUSTLY DEFENDED. THESE CONTESTED ISSUES CONNECT WITH THE THEORETICAL DISPUTE BETWEEN 'COMMON LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM' AND 'CONSTITUTIONAL POSITIVISM' ANALYSED BY DYZENHAUS IN THE CONTEXT OF STATES OF EMERGENCY WHERE THE LIMITS OF EXECUTIVE ACTION AND THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING FACTS BECOME PARTICULARLY SALIENT. THEY PRESS THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS IN THE MUNICIPAL SPHERE.
126	THIS PAPER HAS AS ITS STARTING POINT THE FACT THAT, DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, A DUALISTIC MODEL OF SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS BEEN ASSUMED, WHICH IS LIMITED TO CONTRASTING POLITICAL POWER WITH JURISDICTIONAL POWER. SUCH A REDUCTION WITH RESPECT TO THE CLASSICAL TRINITY CAUSES THE CONFUSION OF THE RESPECTIVE POSITIONS OF THE PARLIAMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT, AS IF THEY WERE NOT BODIES ENDOWED WITH DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL PROFILES, GIVEN THEIR DIFFERENT DEGREE OF CONNECTION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE GOVERNMENT, AS A MORE AGILE AND DYNAMIC INSTITUTION, WHICH SERVES AS THE CENTRE OF ORIENTATION AND IMPULSE OF STATE ACTION, HAS ACQUIRED A GROWING ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY FUNCTIONS, AT THE COST OF DEVALUING THE POSITION ATTRIBUTED TO THE PARLIAMENT. THIS PRE-EMINENCE, OFTEN EXCESSIVE, IS SEEN, TODAY, IN THE EXERCISE OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, DESPITE THE FRAGMENTED SITUATION OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION THAT HAS EXISTED IN SPAIN SINCE 2016. THE RESULTING CHANGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER, WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, CAUSES A REDUCTION IN THE GUARANTEES AVAILABLE TO THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW. REVERSING THIS SITUATION REQUIRES BOTH CORRECTING THESE DYSFUNCTIONS AND SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVING THE POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO PARLIAMENT. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS NONE OTHER THAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS ALWAYS IN GREAT NEED OF LIMITS AND CONTROLS THAT CONTAIN POWER AND ENSURE FREEDOM.
127	IN THE LAST FEW DECADES, AND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007-2008, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE US DOLLAR HAS BEEN MOUNTING. A BROAD-BASED THEORETICAL DEBATE ON THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES HAS BEGUN. THERE IS A LARGE BODY OF STUDIES THAT SEES THE ORIGIN OF AN INTERNATIONAL MONEY AS A MARKET-LED PROCESS. IN THIS VIEW, BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES WILL VERY SOON LOSE ITS ECONOMIC PRE-EMINENCE THE US DOLLAR WILL CONSEQUENTLY SHARE ITS INTERNATIONAL ROLE WITH OTHER CURRENCIES OR EVEN BE REPLACED BY THE RENMINBI. IN THIS PAPER WE CONTEST THIS ARGUMENT, FOCUSING ON THE CONDITIONS THAT MAKE A FIAT MONEY ACCEPTABLE IN INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. TRUST IN A TYPE OF MONEY LIKE THIS NEEDS AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT GUARANTEES THE PROPERTY RIGHTS OF CURRENCY HOLDERS. THIS FRAMEWORK IMPLIES A HIGH LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY AND A HIGH LEVEL OF STATE CAPABILITY IN THE INTERNATIONAL BALANCE OF POWER. SINCE AT PRESENT NO OTHER CURRENCY FULFILS THESE TWO REQUIREMENTS AT THE SAME TIME, THE DOMINANCE OF THE US DOLLAR AS AN INTERNATIONAL MONEY IS GOING TO LAST. (C) 2017 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.

128	THIS ARTICLE IS A MACRO STUDY ON CHINA'S REGIONAL ETHNIC AUTONOMY (REA). USING A CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH, IT TAKES THE EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF REA AS A PROCESS TRANSFORMING FROM DISCOURSE POLITICS TO RULE OF LAW. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP), THE MINORITY GROUPS, THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCACY NETWORK AND THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS AND OTHER ACTORS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROCESS, AND THEY USE THE STRATEGIES OF PROMISING, ENCOURAGING, SHAMING AND MOBILISING. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE PROCESS OF REA TRANSFORMATION WILL BE DIVIDED INTO FIVE STAGES: SELF-ENTRAPMENT, TIGHTENING-UP, DISCURSIVE-PRACTICES STAGE, REGULATIVE STAGE AND PRACTICES-CONSISTENT STAGE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT IN THE FINAL STAGE, GENUINE RULE OF LAW AND WELL-INSTITUTIONALISED DEMOCRACY WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY WHICH MINORITY RIGHTS AND THEIR AUTONOMOUS POWER COULD BE FULLY RESPECTED, WELL PROTECTED AND FACILITATED.
129	IT IS A LONG DEBATE OVER WHETHER RULE OF LAW IS RELIABLE IN CHINA, WHEN SOME CHINESE REGULATIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DECIDED FOR POLITICAL INTERESTS RATHER THAN THE LAW ITSELF. FURTHERMORE, CHINESE COURT DECISIONS ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT ACCORDING WITH STATUTES, EVEN THOUGH THE LATTER ARE PROPERLY WRITTEN. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THESE ISSUES BY COMPARING THE LEGISLATION REASONING AND ENFORCEMENT OF COMPETITION LAW IN CHINA, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WILL NOT LEAD TO ENDORSEMENT OF OR OBJECTION TO THE VIEW THAT RULE OF LAW IS PROPERLY ENFORCED IN CHINA, BUT IT SHALL BE AN INEVITABLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CHINESE JUDICIARY TO DEMONSTRATE EFFORTS IT HAS TAKEN.
130	INTRODUCTION. TODAY, OVERCOMING INCOME INEQUALITY AND POVERTY IS THE BASIS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE ACTUALIZATION OF INNOVATIONS, THE SCIENTOMETRIC SUBSTANTIATION OF THE DOCTRINAL ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE INTERDISCIPLINARY BASIS OF LAW AND THE ECONOMY OF INNOVATIONS AS A RUDDER OF EQUAL ACCESS OF ACTORS TO ECONOMIC CHANCES IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL PLATFORM OF EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DYNAMICS. PROBLEM STATEMENT. THE VECTOR OF RESEARCH IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF MODERN KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING THE RULE OF LAW ON THE ECONOMIC LEVERS OF FORMING AN ECONOMIC AND LEGAL PLATFORM FOR EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DYNAMICS AND FOR REDUCING INCOME INEQUALITY. PURPOSE. ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, SUBSTANTIATION OF ITS DRIVING FORCE FOR EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DYNAMICS AND WELFARE GROWTH. MATERIAL AND METHODS. THE BASIS OF THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IS THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL AXIS OF THE RESEARCH DISCOURSE.ANALYTICAL, HISTORICAL AND METHOD OF RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTOMETRIC THEORETICAL WORKS, FORECASTING, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ANALYSIS, EMPIRICAL METHOD. RESULTS. A VECTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CONCEPT OF PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS IN THE INFORMATION ECONOMY WITH A VIEW TO IMPROVING WELFARE BY ACTIVATING THE QUALITY OF HUMAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN INITIATED. CONCLUSIONS. SCIENTIFIC AND THEORETICAL DYNAMICS OF THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW ON A CROSS-SECTORAL BASIS OF LAW AND ECONOMICS AS A DRIVER OF EQUAL ACCESS OF ACTORS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL PLATFORM FOR THE MODERN DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE OVERCOMING OF INEQUALITY.
131	FOR OVER A YEAR, THE THEN MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED GRANTING PERMANENT PROTECTION TO REFUGEES WHO CAME BY BOAT. HIS NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAD PROMISED TO RE-INTRODUCE A TEMPORARY PROTECTION REGIME, BUT CAME TO POWER WITHOUT THE NUMBERS TO PASS NECESSARY LEGISLATION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIS POLICY OBJECTIVE, THE MINISTER CHOSE TO ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF LEGALLY DUBIOUS TACTICS TO FORESTALL AND DELAY GRANTING PERMANENT PROTECTION, AS REQUIRED BY THE LAW. IN DOING SO, THE MINISTER NAVIGATED SKILFULLY THROUGH THE HOLES IN AUSTRALIA'S INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AND AUSTRALIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE SAGA OF SCOTT MORRISON AND TEMPORARY PROTECTION VISAS IS THEREFORE A TELLING STORY ABOUT THE FRAGILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIA AND DEMONSTRATES HOW A DETERMINED EXECUTIVE CAN UPEND THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER.
132	ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS OFTEN AIM TO IMPLEMENT A PUBLIC GOVERNANCE MODEL SUITABLE FOR A PARTICULAR TASK, BUT THEY FREQUENTLY LACK EMPIRICAL BASIS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE RELEVANT CASE LAW FOLLOWING THE DECISIONS OF SOCIAL WORK CENTRES IN SLOVENIA IN ORDER TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE LAWFULNESS OF THEIR WORK AS GROUNDS FOR THEIR REORGANISATION. AN ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED OF 213 HIGHER COURT JUDGMENTS ISSUED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT CASE LAW REGARDING SOCIAL WORK CENTRE CASES AT THE HIGHEST COURTS IN SLOVENIA IS RATHER CONSISTENT, BUT REVEALS SOME GAPS TO BE BRIDGED IN THE FUTURE, E.G. THE RECOGNITION OF PARTICIPATIVE PROCEDURAL STANDARDS AND MORE FLEXIBLE ORGANISATION. THE CASE LAW IN QUESTION SHOWS THAT FIELD LEGISLATION CAN BE MORE PRINCIPLE-ORIENTED AND RELATED REFORMS CAN BE CARRIED OUT IN SLOVENE SOCIAL WORK CENTRES AND BEYOND.
133	RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY-LEGAL TRANSPLANTS FROM HIGH-TO LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES-HAS ENDURED DESPITE PERSISTENT CRITIQUES. A KEY REASON FOR THIS, WE ARGUE, IS THE ABSENCE OF POSITIVE THEORIES OF PRAXIS THAT CAN INSTANTIATE ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPTS SUCH AS RULE OF LAW. WE DISCUSS THE EMERGENCE OF ONE NASCENT ALTERNATIVE, THE WORLD BANK'S JUSTICE FOR THE POOR PROGRAM, LOCATING IT WITHIN BROADER TURNS TO EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO DEVELOPMENT. IN DOING SO, WE ARGUE THAT RULE OF LAW REFORM MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE POLITICS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS AND THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL FORUMS IN AND THROUGH WHICH RULES SYSTEMS EMERGE. AS SUCH, A PRIMARY TASK OF EXTERNAL AGENCIES IS TO HELP FORGE AND SUSTAIN SUCH FORUMS, TO RECOGNIZE THE DEEP IMBRICATION BETWEEN THE PROCESS NORMS OF THESE FORUMS AND THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW BEING PRODUCED, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH ENSUING DELIBERATIONS REST ARE BOTH SOUND AND ACCESSIBLE. WE CONCLUDE WITH AN EXPLORATION OF THE CHALLENGES OF THIS APPROACH, FROM METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES IN BUILDING AN EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION TO POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO RULE OF LAW REFORMERS THEMSELVES.
134	IT IS NOT A NOVELTY FOR SOCIETY TODAY THAT WE ARE IMMERSED IN THE TRANSFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW LAW THAT IT COMES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE INTERRELATION OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT CREATED IN THE WORLD OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, AND ON THE OTHER, OF THE CONSTANT ADVANCEMENT OF ALREADY ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEIR NEW GENERATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REFLECT ON HOW THESE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES HAVE INFLUENCED AND STILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FIELD OF LAW BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
135	CONTEMPORARY BRITISH COUNTER-TERRORIST LEGISLATION IS DOMINATED BY 'COUNTER-LAW' IN RICHARD ERICSON'S TERMS: BY USING LAW AGAINST LAW, IT SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER SUPPORTS THIS PROPOSITION BY DEVELOPING A DETAILED 'ARCHETYPAL' ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW CONSIDERED AS A CRITICAL IDEAL, DRAWING ON FULLER'S 'MORALITY OF LAW'. THE RULE OF LAW IS IDENTIFIED WITH FOUR TENDENCIES IN LAW TOWARDS GREATER UNIVERSALITY, KNOWABILITY, FOLLOWABILITY AND JUSTIFIABILITY - AND 'COUNTER-LAW' WITH TENDENCIES TO BLOCK OR REVERSE ALL OF THESE. COUNTER-LAW TENDENCIES IN CONTEMPORARY COUNTER-TERRORIST LEGISLATION ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE PROLIFERATION OF INCHOATE, PREPARATORY AND SITUATIONAL OFFENCES. THIS CRITIQUE IS ALSO RELATED TO CONTEMPORARY DEBATES ON LAW AND COUNTER-LAW; IT IS ARGUED THAT CRITIQUES WHICH RELATIVISE OR HISTORICISE THE LIBERAL MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW FALL SHORT BY FAILING TO ENGAGE WITH IT ON ITS OWN TERMS, THEREBY UNDERVALUING ITS UTILITY AS A NORMATIVE RESOURCE. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING THE RANGE, SIGNIFICANCE AND GRAVITY OF THE DEPARTURES FROM THE RULE OF LAW THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, CONSIDERING SOME COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND DRAWING CONCLUSIONS FOR POLICY-MAKERS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS.
136	CORRUPTION IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S DEVELOPING ECONOMIES TODAY. WORLD BANK STUDIES PUT BRIBERY AT OVER $1 TRILLION PER YEAR ACCOUNTING FOR UP TO 12 OF THE GDP OF NATIONS LIKE NIGERIA, KENYA AND VENEZUELA. THOUGH LARGELY IGNORED FOR MANY YEARS, INTEREST IN WORLD WIDE CORRUPTION HAS BEEN REKINDLED BY RECENT CORPORATE SCANDALS IN THE US AND EUROPE. CORRUPTION IN THE DEVELOPING NATIONS IS SAID TO RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS. MASS POVERTY HAS BEEN CITED AS A FACILITATING CONDITION FOR CORRUPTION JUST AS AN INABILITY TO MANAGE A SUDDEN UPSURGE IN MINERAL REVENUES HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH BREEDING CORRUPTION AND ADVENTUROUS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT AMONG PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA. VIRTUALLY ALL DEVELOPING NATIONS THAT HAVE SERIOUS CORRUPTION PROBLEMS ALSO HAVE VERY LIMITED ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND A VERY WEAK ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN SUCH NATIONS, CORRUPTION REPRESENTS A REGRESSIVE TAXATION THAT BEARS HARD ON THE POOR. IT HAS A DAMPENING EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENT AND IT COULD RESULT IN THE PRODUCTION OF INFERIOR GOODS AS COMPANIES FIND WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE UNDER-THE-TABLE PAYMENTS. FINALLY, CORRUPTION IS A DANGEROUS THREAT TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF SOME OF THE DEVELOPING NATIONS THEMSELVES. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT NEW URGENT INITIATIVES ARE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THE DANGERS POSED BY CORRUPTION IN THE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. THEY INCLUDE MAKING THE ECONOMIES OF THESE NATIONS MORE OPEN BY THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE GOVERNMENT FROM THE PRODUCTIVE SECTOR AND BY THE ABOLITION OF UNNECESSARILY STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS CONDUCT. THE RULE OF LAW NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED IN THESE NATIONS AND THOSE COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA AND VENEZUELA SHOULD IGNORE SCRUPLES OVER SOVEREIGNTY AND SEEK FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR OIL WEALTH. FINALLY, MULTINATIONALS SHOULD BE MADE TO DISCLOSE ALL THE PAYMENTS THEY MAKE IN DEVELOPING NATIONS TO SUCH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OR TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL WHERE THEY CAN BE REVIEWED BY ANYONE INTERESTED.
137	A MODERN POLITICAL SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THREE SETS OF INSTITUTIONS: A MODERN, IMPERSONAL STATE, RULE OF LAW, AND MECHANISMS FOR DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. CHINA DEVELOPED THE MODERN STATE MORE THAN TWO MILLENNIA AGO, BUT HAS YET TO ACHIEVE A REAL RULE OF LAW LIMITING STATE POWER, AND HAS NO DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. CURRENT CHINESE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY REPLICATES MANY FEATURES OF DYNASTIC RULE, INCLUDING TOP-DOWN ORGANIZATION AND UPWARD, RATHER THAN DOWNWARD, ACCOUNTABILITY. THE SYSTEM IS UNBALANCED, WITH INSUFFICIENT CONSTRAINTS ON EXECUTIVE POWER, RISKING EMERGENCE OF THE 'BAD EMPEROR' PROBLEM. THE CURRENT ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN IS UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF A TRUE RULE OF LAW. TRANSITION TO A MORE FULLY MODERN POLITICAL SYSTEM SHOULD SEQUENCE RULE OF LAW BEFORE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, PLACING REAL CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON STATE POWER AND ONLY GRADUALLY OPENING UP THE SYSTEM TO GREATER POLITICAL PLURALISM.
138	REQUIREMENT THAT TRIBUNALS BE ESTABLISHED BY LAW - EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS - EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS - FAIR TRIAL - RULE OF LAW - SEPARATION OF POWERS - PUBLIC TRUST
139	THIS ARTICLE USES INNOVATIVE DIGITAL RESEARCH METHODS TO EVALUATE THE MODERATION OF IMAGES THAT DEPICT WOMEN'S BODIES ON INSTAGRAM AGAINST THE WESTERN LEGAL IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE CONTESTED RULE OF LAW VALUES OF FORMAL EQUALITY, CERTAINTY, REASON GIVING, TRANSPARENCY, PARTICIPATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FEMALE FORMS ARE THE FOCAL POINT FOR OUR INVESTIGATION DUE TO WIDESPREAD CONCERNS THAT THE PLATFORM IS ARBITRARILY REMOVING SOME IMAGES OF WOMEN'S BODIES AND, POSSIBLY, PRIVILEGING CERTAIN BODY TYPES. AFTER EXAMINING WHETHER 4944 LIKE IMAGES DEPICTING (A) UNDERWEIGHT, (B) MID-RANGE AND (C) OVERWEIGHT WOMEN'S BODIES WERE MODERATED ALIKE, WE IDENTIFY AN OVERALL TREND OF INCONSISTENT MODERATION. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT UP TO 22 PER CENT OF IMAGES ARE POTENTIALLY FALSE POSITIVES-IMAGES THAT DO NOT APPEAR TO VIOLATE INSTAGRAM'S CONTENT POLICIES AND WERE REMOVED. THE PLATFORM'S OPAQUE MODERATION PROCESSES, HOWEVER, MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER IMAGES WERE REMOVED BY INSTAGRAM OR BY THE USER. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE APPARENT LACK OF RULE OF LAW VALUES IN THE PLATFORM'S MODERATION PROCESSES, AND INSTAGRAM'S LARGELY UNFETTERED POWER TO MODERATE CONTENT, ARE SIGNIFICANT NORMATIVE CONCERNS WHICH POSE AN ONGOING RISK OF ARBITRARINESS FOR WOMEN AND USERS MORE BROADLY. WE PROPOSE WAYS THAT PLATFORMS CAN IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY, AND ADVOCATE FOR THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL METHODS FOR EMPIRICAL, LEGAL ANALYSIS OF PLATFORM GOVERNANCE. THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE CRUCIAL TO HELP IDENTIFY ARBITRARINESS WHERE IT EXISTS AND TO ALLAY THE SUSPICIONS AND FEARS OF USERS WHERE IT DOES NOT.
140	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TEXT IS TO OFFER A CLASSIFICATION OF THE ETHICAL VISIONS IN CIRCULATION IN THE CURRENT DEBATE CAPABLE OF IDENTIFYING WHICH OF THEM ARE COMPATIBLE OR NOT WITH THE CONCEPT AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE TEXT STARTS FROM THE ANALYSIS OF SOME THOUGHT MODELS PRESENT IN ANIMALIST, FEMINIST AND DECOLONIAL ETHICAL VISIONS TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS OF COMPATIBILITY AND PROBLEMS OF CARICATURE, THAT IS, WHICH OF THESE VISIONS DEVELOP TENSIONS AND INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH OR OFFER CARICATURED VISIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. BASED ON THESE REFLECTIONS, THE TEXT PROPOSES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ETHICS OF IDENTITY AND ETHICS OF COEXISTENCE AND OUTLINES THE GENERAL LINES OF A MULTINORMATIVE INSTITUTIONAL MODEL THAT ALLOWS BOTH TO COEXIST DEMOCRATICALLY IN THE SAME POLITICAL COMMUNITY.
141	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'JUSTICE' IMPLICATIONS OF USING ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ODR) PLATFORMS AS TECHNOLOGY-MEDIATED INTERFACES FOR SMALL CLAIM DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. DATA IS OBTAINED FROM A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF CONSTRUCTION STAKEHOLDERS, ADMINISTERED USING DIRECT NON-RANDOM SAMPLING OF PROFESSIONAL CONTACTS WITH THE AUTHORS. DATA IS ANALYSED USING SAS 9.4 (SAS INSTITUTE, CARY, NC) ON A WINDOWS 7 PLATFORM. SURPRISINGLY, STUDY FINDINGS DO NOT SUGGEST ANY 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'JUSTICE' IMPLICATIONS FOR SMALL CLAIM ODR. TENTATIVELY, THIS CONCLUSION SUPPORTS WIDER USE OF ODR. THE ORIGINALITY OF THE STUDY IS THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE ACADEMIC AND PRACTITIONER INTEREST IN VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR), BOTH PRACTITIONER USE AND ACADEMIC STUDY OF ODR REMAIN SPARSE. THUS, THIS STUDY SERVES AS A FOUNDATION FOR FURTHER EMPIRICAL EXPLORATION OF ODR AS A NASCENT COMPONENT OF ADR. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD. APM AND IPMA. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
142	MANY COMMENTATORS HAVE MENTIONED THE FACT THAT MICHAEL OAKESHOTT DESCRIBES THE AMERICAN FOUNDING AS A "RATIONALIST" PROJECT. BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACTUAL CHARACTER OF HIS CRITICISMS. THIS ESSAY FIRST CONSIDERS THE CRITIQUE ON ITS OWN TERMS BEFORE TURNING TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE THAT OAKESHOTT RECOMMENDS, WHICH IS DESIGNATED "THE RULE OF LAW." SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS EMERGE FROM THIS ANALYSIS. FIRST, OAKESHOTT'S CONCEPT OF RATIONALISM STILL HAS PURCHASE IN THE PRESENT DAY. SECOND, IT CAN BE APPLIED TO CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN LAW AND POLITICS AS A WAY OF ILLUMINATING CERTAIN WIDESPREAD POLITICAL TENDENCIES. AND FINALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE BOTH TO APPROPRIATE HIS CRITIQUE AND SIMULTANEOUSLY TO MODERATE IT SUCH THAT IT PROVES BENEFICIAL FOR THINKING ABOUT OUR CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES.
143	USING CROSS-COUNTRY PANEL DATA AND EMPLOYING THE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) METHOD, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL TRUST ON ECONOMIC EXCHANGE BETWEEN CHINA AND ITS MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS OVER THE PERIOD 2005?2013. SOCIAL TRUST SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES BILATERAL TRADE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) BETWEEN CHINA AND ITS PARTNERS, AND THIS EFFECT IS MUCH STRONGER IN NONMEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) THAN OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES. FURTHER EXPLORATION SUGGESTS THAT THE HETEROGENEITY COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE SUBSTITUTION RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL TRUST AND THE RULE OF LAW: SOCIAL TRUST MATTERS MORE IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAKER. WE ALSO .FIND THAT THE IMPACT OF TRUST ON TRADE AND FDI IS WEAKER IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GREATER LANGUAGE SIMILARITY TO CHINA, ARE ADJACENT TO CHINA, OR ARE COMMON-LAW-ORIGIN COUNTRIES. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, IN IMPLEMENTING THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND COMPANIES SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON EACH COUNTRY?S LEGAL NORMS BUT ALSO ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO THE ROLE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC EXCHANGE.
144	THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE LITERATURE HIGHLIGHTS VARIOUS TRADE-OFFS INVOLVED IN THE CHOICE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LUSTRATION AS A TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MEASURE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW INTERNATIONAL LEGAL BODY RULINGS ON LUSTRATION LAWS HAVE INTERPRETED RULE-OF-LAW VERSUS JUSTICE CONCERNS. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION HAVE EXPLORED POSSIBLE INFORMATION PROBLEMS, DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS, EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ISSUES, AND BUREAUCRATIC LOYALTY CONCERNS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF LUSTRATION. THREE FINDINGS EMERGE FROM THEIR LEGAL RULINGS. FIRST, CONTRARY TO POPULAR NOTIONS, INTERNATIONAL LEGAL BODIES ARE NOT ANTILUSTRATION. THE INSTITUTIONS ARE ENGAGING WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FAIR IMPLEMENTATION, NOT THE LEGALITY, OF LUSTRATION LAWS. SECOND, THE PRIORITIZING OF JUSTICE CONCERNS DURING THE TRANSITION EFFORTS IS HIGHLIGHTED AS A WAY TO LAY A STRONG DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATION. THIRD, THE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF PLACING RULE OF LAW IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT, THEREBY SITUATING POST-COMMUNIST SOCIETIES WITHIN OTHER POSTTOTALITARIAN REGIME-BUILDING NARRATIVES.
145	THIS ARTICLE SCRUTINISES THE EU'S RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN THE ENP COUNTRIES IN MOLDOVA, UKRAINE AND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES, MOROCCO AND TUNISIA. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THERE ARE VARIATIONS IN POLICY OUTCOMES ACROSS POLICY INITIATIVES OWING TO THE CONTESTED NATURE OF THE POLICY OBJECTIVE AND THE DIFFERENCES IN THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS. SHE DRAWS ON BUREAUCRATIC POLITICS TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT. IN CONCLUSION SHE OBSERVES THAT THE OBSERVED POWER STRUGGLES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY THE EU EITHER AS A STRATEGIC OR A NORMATIVE POWER. EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATIONS ARE DRAWN FROM THE EU'S ANTI-DRUGS, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND JUDICIAL REFORM POLICIES
146	THE UNION'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS HAS WORSENED AND HAS LED TO AMPLE REACTIONS FROM ACADEMIA AND EU INSTITUTIONS. MOST NOTABLY, THE SITUATION IN POLAND CULMINATED IN THE ACTIVATION OF THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE 7(1) TEU BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE 258 TFEU MAY YIELD A FILLY COMPLEMENTARY, YET MORE EFFECTIVE, MEANS ALONGSIDE EXISTING MEASURES TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY SPECIFIC AND EPISODIC VIOLATIONS OF EU LAW, BUT ALSO A GENENAL SITUATION IN A MEMBER STATE AS A SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCY IN THE RULE OF LAW. CONSCIOUS OF SUGGESTIONS MADE BEFORE US IN THIS REGARD, WE OFFER A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE INFRINGEMENT ACTION DE LEGE DATA BY ENGAGING, STEP-BY-STEP, WITH THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE HURDLES TO OVERCOME IN THIS ATTEMPT.
147	THE CONCEPT OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW HAS DEVELOPED IN A FORM DISTINCT FROM, BUT RELATED TO, THE RULE OF LAW AT THE DOMESTIC (OR EUROPEAN) LEVEL. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NOTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THEN, AFTER EXPLAINING THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF INVESTMENT PROTECTION AND ITS DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM, SETS THESE AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT CONCLUDES BY LOOKING AT HOW THE EUROPEAN UNION'S PROPOSAL FOR A MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT COURT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AUGMENTING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IN THE FIELD OF INVESTMENT PROTECTION.
148	GLOBALISATION REQUIRES A COMPETITION LAW REGIME SINCE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE OVERALL STATE ECONOMIC POLICY. FOR COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD THAT ARE FACING GLOBALISATION, A SOUND FRAMEWORK OF COMPETITION LAW IS CRUCIAL FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF PRIVATE RESTRAINTS ON TRADE, SUCH AS BOYCOTTS AGAINST FOREIGN FIRMS, AND OF ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION. IN PARTICULAR, COMPETITION LAW PLAYS A PROMINENT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS FOLLOWED IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET IN MODERN SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ISSUES ARISING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE KOREAN ECONOMY AND COMPETITION LAW, AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESS IN THE PROGRESS OF COMPETITION POLICY, AND SUGGESTS PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.
149	THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW PLATO BOTH DRAWS ON ATHENIAN IDEAS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO REFINES AND REFORMS IN ACCORD WITH HIS PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS. LIKE THE ATHENIANS, PLATO ALSO BELIEVES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF OFFICIALS, BUT TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH. THE ATHENIANS REQUIRED ALL OFFICIALS TO SUBMIT THEIR ACCOUNTS TO THE LOGISTAI SELECTED BY LOT EACH YEAR AND ALLOWED AVERAGE CITIZENS TO BRING CHARGES BEFORE THE EUTHYNOI, WHO INTRODUCED CASES TO COURT (ATH. POL. 48,4-5). PLATO STRONGLY BELIEVES IN THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT PLACES THE TASK IN THE HANDS OF SCRUTINEERS, WHO ARE APPOINTED BY ELECTION AND NOT BY LOT (LEG. 715C, 874E-875D). PLATO ALSO BELIEVES STRONGLY IN THE IMPORTANCE OF FAIRNESS IN PROCEDURE AND ADOPTS SEVERAL ATHENIAN PROCEDURES WHILE ALSO INTRODUCING REFORMS. IN ATHENS THERE WAS EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND IN ACCESS TO OFFICE, BUT PLATO THOUGHT THAT DEMOCRACY TOOK THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TOO FAR. AS A RESULT, PLATO INTRODUCES DIFFERENT PENALTIES AND DIFFERENT RIGHTS FOR MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT CENSUS CLASSES, FOR CITIZENS AND FOREIGNERS (854C-855A) AND FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN (944A-C).
150	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PEACEBUILDING IN KOSOVO SINCE 1999. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EU' S POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES IN KOSOVO IN THE AFTERMATH OF KOSOVO'S UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE TRACK RECORD OF THE EU RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX) AND ITS INVOLVEMENT IN SECURITY SECTOR REFORM. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL OWNERSHIP PRINCIPLE AND THE LOCAL PERCEPTIONS AND LEGITIMACY OF EULEX. IT OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF THE OBSTACLES AND CHALLENGES FACED BY THE MISSION.
151	THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO BRING CLASSES BACK INTO EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF ACCESS TO CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE, FOCUSING ON THE LINKAGE BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA. WE DEFINE SIX CLASSES, THE ELITE CLASS, THE OLD MIDDLE CLASS, THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS, THE SELF-EMPLOYED GETIHU, THE WORKING CLASS, AND FARMERS, AND THEN EXAMINE CLASS DIFFERENTIALS IN CHOOSING LEGAL RESOLUTIONS TO CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTES, BOTH ACTUAL AND HYPOTHETICAL ONES. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM A NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY IN 2005, WE SHOW THAT THE ELITE AND THE NEW MIDDLE CLASSES ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THE OTHER CLASSES TO PREFER THE LAW TO OTHER FORMS OF RESOLUTIONS IF THEY WERE TO ENCOUNTER ANY DISPUTES; BUT AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO, CLASS DIFFERENTIALS DISAPPEAR TO A LARGE EXTENT, BUT THE URBAN-RURAL DIVIDE REMAINS. AMONG THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CIVIL DISPUTES, THE ELITE AND THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION. THE RULING ELITES, IN ALLIANCE WITH THE NEW MIDDLE CLASS, COULD BE THE MAJOR POLITICAL AGENTS IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA.
152	THIS PAPER REFLECTS ON THE CONCEPTUAL APPROACH ADOPTED, IN INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE, TO THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. IT PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING, IN INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE, OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEVELOPMENT. IT DOES SO BY LOOKING ESPECIALLY AT THE PRACTICE OF THE UN, AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT MANY EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES. AFTER FIRST EXAMINING THE PREDOMINANT PARADIGM IN THE RULE OF LAW FIELD ADOPTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY UNTIL 2010, AND THE EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE THEREAFTER, IT CONCLUDES THAT THE OBSERVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A GIVEN COUNTRY IS DETERMINED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURES, CULTURAL NORMS, INSTITUTIONS AND LAWS. ON THIS BASIS, AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE ADOPTED CONCEPTS OF RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, IT FINDS THE INCREASING RECOGNITION BY THE UN OF THE MUTUALLY REINFORCING IMPACT OF THESE NOTIONS AS ADEQUATE. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS GREATER ATTENTION TO BE PAID TO SEVERAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OBSERVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE MAIN RECIPIENTS OF THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THIS FIELD. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IT INDICATES AREAS FOR REFORM.
153	THE WAR IN UKRAINE TRIGGERED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT THE EUROPEAN UNION LEVEL. THE SPEED AT WHICH THE EU HAS ACHIEVED PROGRESS ON SANCTIONS, MIGRATION AND DEFENSE IS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE. BUT THE RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AGAINST UKRAINE HAS ALSO SERVED AS A PRETEXT FOR PUTTING ASIDE INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROVIDED ADDITIONAL POLITICAL RATIONALES FOR INACTION AGAINST MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLATION OF EUROPEAN VALUES, AS WELL AS TRIGGERED THE DEEPENING OF DOUBLE STANDARDS IN SEVERAL FIELDS. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT USING THIS CRISIS AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR FURTHER INACTION IN THE CONTEXT OF EU VALUES IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE COURSE OF ACTION. THE UNION MUST NOT DELAY FURTHER THE NEED TO ACT TO HALT THE INSIDIOUS EROSION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN ITS OWN BORDERS BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL.
154	THE ECJ HAS NOT SO FAR DEVELOPED A SINGLE, CONSISTENT APPROACH TO CASES IN WHICH THE RIGHT TO ACCESS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IS EXERCISED BY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANISATIONS PURSUING THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAUSE (PRIVATE WATCHDOGS). WHILE IN SOME CASES THE LUXEMBOURG JURISPRUDENCE HAS FOLLOWED A RESTRICTIVE APPROACH, SUPPORTING INTERESTS AND SECONDARY LAW PROVISIONS CONFLICTING WITH TRANSPARENCY, IN OTHER IT HAS UNCONDITIONALLY ENDORSED A SUPREME CHARACTER OF THE ACCESS RIGHT. THIS CONTRIBUTION CONFRONTS BOTH OF THE APPROACHES WHENEVER THE ACCESS RIGHT EXERCISED BY PRIVATE WATCHDOGS HAS CLASHED WITH CONFIDENTIALITY STEMMING FROM SECONDARY LAW PROVISIONS: FROM STATE AID, STAFF RULES, DATA PROTECTION, ANTITRUST AND BEYOND. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MOST OFTEN THE JUDICIAL STANDARD RESTRICTING THE ACCESS RIGHT INTERFERES WITH A FEEDBACK RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHEN PROPERLY CONSTRUED AND APPRAISED, MAY FORM A BASIS FOR AN ARGUABLY MORE UNIFORM AND STABLE JUDICIAL STANDARD.
155	MEXICO FACES INTENSE RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES VIS-A-VIS SOCIETY (CRIME, INFORMAL MARKETS, ETC.) AND THE STATE (CORRUPTION, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, ETC.). ONE FACTOR LINKING THESE TWO DIMENSIONS IS THE LACK OF LEGITIMACY. MEXICANS RARELY TRUST THE LAW, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, OR THEIR POLITICIANS. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS, DIMENSIONS AND CHALLENGES OF THIS ASPECT OF THE DOMINANT MEXICAN POLITICAL DISCOURSE. FOLLOWING A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE MEXICAN POLITICAL CULTURE AS IT RELATES TO QUESTIONS OF LEGITIMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, I ARGUE THAT THESE FACTORS GENERATE AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF CORRUPTION, AN ANTI-STATE AND HENCE PRO-SOCIETY BIAS, AND AN AMBIGUOUS POLITICAL SITUATION, AND, IN TURN, CRAFT AN ENVIRONMENT FEEDING CORRUPTION, AND NON-SYSTEMIC BEHAVIOR. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING NOT ONLY THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTABLISHING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES OF DOING SO, BUT ALSO THE NEED TO PRIORITIZE THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE STATE AND STATE OFFICIALS BASED ON A STRATEGY OF STRENGTH ENING CIVIL SOCIETY.
156	VIOLENCE AND INSECURITY IN LATIN AMERICA IS A CLAIM FOR THE COMMISSIONING OF "MANO DURA" POLICIES. DESPITE ITS POPULARITY, THOSE POLICIES HAVE SHOWN LOW EFFECTIVENESS. IN FACT, THEY ARE USUALLY THE PATH TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE REPRESSION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS. ACTUALLY, THOSE GROUPS ARE DOUBLY VICTIMIZED BY ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFICULT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITION AND BY THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE OF VIOLENT GOVERNMENT ACTION. THIS PAPER, ANALYSES FOUR CASES, IN FOUR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES: BRAZIL, MEXICO, COLOMBIA AND GUATEMALA THROUGH THE LENSES OF "VIOLENT PLURALISM" APPROACH. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR A THEORETICAL APPROACH BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND VIOLENCE VERSUS THOSE APPROACHES THAT CONSIDER VIOLENCE AS A MALFUNCTION OF STATE.
157	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S ROLE IN THE ITALIAN LEGAL ORDER, PARTICULARLY FOCUSSING ON THE PARADOX OF A COURT THAT IS AT THE SAME TIME SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND GUARDIAN OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS PARADOX EMERGES IN A CLEAR MANNER WHEN THE COURT IS CALLED TO RULE ON AUSTERITY MEASURES. TO DO THIS, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE MAIN, UNPRECEDENTED DEVELOPMENTS THAT AFFECTED THE "UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION" DURING THE TIMES OF EURO-CRISIS. THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES A FIRST SEASON OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S CASE LAW ON THE CRISIS LEGISLATION (2011-2014), CHARACTERIZED BY A CAUTIOUS AND PARTLY AMBIGUOUS APPROACH. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COURT'S CASE LAW. THE ARTICLE GOES INTO THE DETAILS OF THREE RECENT AND NOTABLE JUDGEMENTS, REVEALING A NEW APPROACH OF THE COURT TO THE CRISIS LEGISLATION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT UNLIKE A WIDE PERCEPTION, THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AFFECTED THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT' ROLE IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT MANNER. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE COURT'S RECENT DECISIONS TO OVERRULE ITS SETTLED CASE LAW WITH REGARD TO THE TEMPORAL EFFECTS OF ITS JUDGEMENTS RAISE SERIOUS CONCERN WITH REGARD TO THE ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW.
158	THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN THE LODESTAR GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE NORMATIVE IMPACT OF THIS PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN INCREASING IN THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT, IN PARTICULAR IN CASES DEALING WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTUAL CORE OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE CONVENTION SYSTEM AS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF "EUROPEAN PUBLIC ORDER". SUBSEQUENTLY, THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL NORMATIVE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXPLORED AS WELL AS THE COURT'S STATEMENT THAT THE PRINCIPLE IS "INHERENT IN ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE CONVENTION". ON THIS BASIS, AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS IS UNDERTAKEN OF THE APPLICATION IN RECENT STRASBOURG CASE-LAW OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AS A FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIC COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR REFLECTS ON THE "SYMBIOTIC" RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIELD OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE STRASBOURG COURT AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
159	COMPOSITE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES - EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF UNION COURTS TO REVIEW NON-BINDING NATIONAL PREPARATORY ACTS - NO JURISDICTION OF UNION COURTS TO ENFORCE NATIONAL LAW - AUTONOMY AND UNIFORMITY OF EU LAW - NO JUDICIAL CONTROL POSSIBLE OF VIOLATION OF DOMESTIC LAW BY NATIONAL AUTHORITIES - NATIONAL RULE OF LAW GAP - JUDICIAL REVIEW, EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION, AND PRINCIPLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGALITY
160	THE CITY OF MOSCOW CONTINUES TO ENFORCE A RESTRICTIVE RESIDENCE REGISTRATION REGIME SIMILAR TO THE PROPISKA SYSTEM THAT PREVAILED IN THE SOVIET ERA-DESPITE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, FEDERAL STATUTORY PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING THAT RIGHT, AND CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULINGS THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IN THIS NOTE, DAMIAN SCHAIBLE ARGUES THAT THE CONTINUED RESTRICTIONS REPRESENT MORE THAN SIMPLY AN ONGOING VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF MOSCOW'S ILLEGAL RESIDENTS; THEY ARE ALSO AN INDICATOR OF RUSSIA'S IMPERFECT TRANSITION TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A PRACTICAL OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT TRANSITION.
161	WHEN I WAS ASKED TO SERVE AS GOVERNOR GENERAL OF CANADA, I DISCOVERED I HAD MUCH TO RELEARN. DESPITE MY BACKGROUND AS A LAW STUDENT, PROFESSOR, AND DEAN, I HAD TO REVISIT THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND CONVENTIONS OF OUR CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY AS THEY RELATE TO THE AUTHORITY AND FUNCTION OF THE CROWN IN CANADA. MY RE-EDUCATION ENABLED ME TO DEVELOP AN EVEN DEEPER ADMIRATION FOR HOW PRECIOUS THE RULE OF LAW IS IN OUR COUNTRY, HOW THIN AND VULNERABLE ITS VENEER CAN BE, AND HOW VITAL IT IS IN MOVING CLOSER TO JUSTICE. EVEN MORE, MY RE-EDUCATION REVEALED FOR ME ANEW THAT THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF LAW IS A HOLLOW PURSUIT IF WE DO NOT USE IT TO STRIVE TOWARD JUSTICE.
162	TO REALIZE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GREEN ECONOMY, IT IS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. AS A NEW DRIVING FORCE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT, GREEN ECONOMY IS ANALYZED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COORDINATING ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER FULLY ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF GREEN ECONOMY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT. BASED ON THE INHERENT RELATIONSHIP, THE RULE OF LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ARE CONDUCIVE TO PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ALSO PLAY A CONTINUOUS ROLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT. AREAS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ALSO HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. DRIVEN BY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, GREEN ECONOMY CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY, AND FURTHER PROMOTE THE COORDINATED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE RESULTS OF THE CASE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT, IN THE PROPORTION OF THE GREEN ECONOMY WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT, COMPARED WITH THE TRADITIONAL POLICIES AND REGULATIONS, IT GREATLY REDUCES THE AGGRAVATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND HAS A POSITIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY. IT CAN NOT ONLY EFFECTIVELY ACCELERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ALSO REALIZE THE REFLECTION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GREEN ECONOMY AND PROMOTE THE OPTIMIZATION OF ECONOMIC STRUCTURE.
163	THE AUTHOR CRITICALLY EXPOSES THE LABOR PROBLEMATIC OF THE WORKER AT THE SERVICE OF THE PERUVIAN STATE SUBJECT TO THE REGIME OF THE SO-CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE CONTRACT (CAS) AND AIMS TO DETERMINE THAT, IN LABOR MATTERS, THE STATE APPLIES THE RULE OF LAW MAKING IT PREVAIL OVER THE PRINCIPLE LEGAL, TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE WORKER, THUS AFFECTING THE PRINCIPLES AND LABOR RIGHTS EXISTING IN THIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP. LIKEWISE, IT HAS THE PURPOSE OF VERIFYING THAT THE STATE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE WORKER SUBJECT TO SAID LABOR REGIME, THE RIGHT TO THE TIME OF SERVICES ACQUIRED NOR THE PROTECTION AGAINST THE ARBITRARY DISMISSAL. THE INVESTIGATOR CONCLUDES THAT, DUE TO THE UNDUE PREVALENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW OVER THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE CONTRACT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT AFFECTS PRINCIPLES AND LABOR RIGHTS, SO IT RAISES THE MODIFICATION OF THE CAS REGIME SO THAT ALL LABOR RIGHTS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE STATE WORKER.
164	A STRONG INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH EMBEDS RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, IS CRITICAL TO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT DRIVE. IN GENERAL, THE EFFECTIVENESS AND PREDICTABILITY OF THE JUDICIARY, QUALITY OF CONTRACT ENFORCEMENTS, INCLUDING PROPERTY RIGHTS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, STABILITY OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ARE INDISPENSABLE TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS IN RESOURCE-SCARCE COUNTRIES, NECESSITATING THIS STUDY. EMPLOYING THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES ON ANNUAL TIME SERIES DATA COVERING THE PERIOD FROM 1970 TO 2020 AND THE FULLY MODIFIED OLS (FMOLS) AND DYNAMIC OLS (DOLS) FOR ROBUSTNESS CHECK, THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS SHOW THAT REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND RULE OF LAW MATTER TO FDI INFLOWS IN NIGERIA. POLITICAL STABILITY AND EXCHANGE RATE ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO FDI, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (MEASURED BY ICT) HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FDI, WHILE INFLATION RATE (A PROXY FOR MACROECONOMIC POLICY ENVIRONMENT) AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE NEGATIVELY RELATED TO FDI INFLOWS. BASED ON THE FOREGOING FINDINGS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SOUND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS BE DEVELOPED, IN ADDITION TO AN EFFICIENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORT FDI INFLOWS. INCREASED INVESTMENT IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, STABLE POLITICAL AND MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND A COMPETITIVE EXCHANGE RATE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT WAYS OF PROMOTING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOWS IN NIGERIA.
165	ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW IS UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT THE "ANTI-LEGAL TEMPER" THAT EMERGED IN THE 1920S, WHEN LEONARD WHITE'S MANAGERIALISM LARGELY DISPLACED FRANK GOODNOW'S EMPHASIS ON THE INTIMACY OF LAW AND ADMINISTRATION. ALTHOUGH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS A DISTINGUISHED SUBFIELD OF SCHOLARSHIP AND PRACTICE WITHIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, THE CONSENSUS VIEW WITHIN THE PROFESSION SEEMS TO BE THAT LAW IS ONE OF MANY CONSTRAINTS ON ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION RATHER THAN ITS SOURCE, A CHALLENGE TO ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP RATHER THAN ITS GUIDING PRINCIPLE. IN ADDITION TO UNACCEPTABLY NARROWING THE RANGE OF VALUES INFUSING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, SUCH A VIEW UNDERMINES THE PROFESSION'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DESIGN OF OUR GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS AT A TIME WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED. TO FULFILL ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MUST COMMIT ITSELF TO THE RULE OF LAW AS AN INSTITUTION THAT SECURES ITS LEGITIMACY.
166	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER CIVIL SERVANT VALUES IN CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS REFLECT DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS (I.E., RULE OF MORALITY VS. RULE OF LAW). THE QUESTION IS HIGHLY RELEVANT BECAUSE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE RECENTLY UNDERGONE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION, AND THEIR MUTUAL DEALINGS AND INTERACTIONS HAVE INCREASED AND GAINED IMPORTANCE. A PILOT SURVEY AND A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF CODES OF CONDUCT WERE USED TO ESTABLISH A VALUE SET THAT WAS TESTED IN AN EXPLORATORY SURVEY OF CHINESE (N = 68) AND DUTCH (N = 45) CIVIL SERVANTS. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT VALUE PREFERENCES REFLECTED ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS LESS CLEARLY THAN EXPECTED, AND VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW TRADITION WERE IN SOME INSTANCES MORE IMPORTANT FOR CHINESE THAN FOR DUTCH RESPONDENTS. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS ARE OFFERED.
167	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE AUSTRALIAN COALITION GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPT TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE CODE FOR THE TENDERING AND PERFORMANCE OF BUILDING WORK 2016 (CTH) ('2016 CODE'). IT TRACES THE EVOLUTION OF THE SEPARATE SCHEME OF CONSTRUCTION REGULATION ADOPTED IN 2005 FOLLOWING THE COLE ROYAL COMMISSION, THE SUBSEQUENT LABOR GOVERNMENT CHANGES TO THIS SCHEME, AND THE INITIATIVES OF THE COALITION GOVERNMENT SINCE 2013. THE ARTICLE THEN CONSIDERS THE USE OF PROCUREMENT GUIDELINES TO IMPLEMENT WORKPLACE REFORM IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SINCE 1997, FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE NEW PROCUREMENT RULES IN THE 2016 CODE. THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXAMINED AS A BASIS FOR ANALYSIS OF ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF ITS REINSTATEMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF THE PROCUREMENT RULES IN THE 2016 CODE IS PARTLY AIMED AT RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW - NARROWLY CONCEIVED AS ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW - BUT IS ALSO A MECHANISM TO REDUCE UNION POWER AND ENHANCE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.
168	IN THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM, DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE GLOBAL SOCIETY ARE DEEPLY CHALLENGING THE INTERNATIONAL LAW. INDEED, TODAY WITH NEW FACTORS ALTERING THE SPATIAL, STRUCTURAL AND REGULATORY DIMENSION OF STATE AND HUMANS RELATIONS, AT THE DOMESTIC AND AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER REMAINS IN ITS CRISIS OF IDENTITY. ON THE ONE HAND, THE PREDOMINANCE OF LIBERAL AND NON-FORMALISTIC SYSTEMS INCREASES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN POWER, LAW AND JUSTICE, WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, MULTILEVEL ACTION IS ENCOURAGED AND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE PROMOTED. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS, WHILE THE TOPIC OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO MARK THE COURSE OF THESE CHANGES AND TO LIMIT THE NEW SOVEREIGN POWERS OR ACTION FORUMS, THERE IS NO CONSENSUS EITHER ON ITS SCOPE OR ON ITS LEGAL STATUS. RATHER, IT IS CONCEIVED AS A "CIVILIZING TEST" UNDER CERTAIN STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES OR VALUES: CERTAINTY, PREDICTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. IN ORDER TO TEST SUCH A PURPOSE, IT IS PROPOSED AS A FIELD OF STUDY THAT STABILIZATION OPERATIONS - AND THEIR CHANGING BASIC PRINCIPLES-SHOULD NOT ONLY BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE COUNTRIES OR REGIONS WHERE THEY OPERATE.
169	ON 22 OCTOBER 2020, THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL OF POLAND RULED THAT AN ABORTION DUE TO FOETAL IMPAIRMENT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTROVERSIAL RULING AS WELL AS ITS MAIN TENETS, FOCUSING ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROFFERED BY THE TRIBUNAL AND ON THE RULE OF LAW CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION. AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF ABORTION IN POLAND SINCE 1945, THE ARTICLE OFFERS A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK USED IN THE POLISH ABORTION DEBATE. BASED ON A CLOSE READING OF THE TRIBUNAL'S RULING AND THE DISSENTING OPINIONS, THE ARTICLE POINTS OUT THE PARTICULARITIES IN THE TRIBUNAL'S ENGAGEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS JURISPRUDENCE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION IS YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF THE CRISIS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND HAS FOUND ITSELF SINCE 2015. IT BEARS EVIDENCE TO THE CLOSING OF THE JURISPRUDENTIAL HORIZON CAUSED BY THE POLITICAL CHANGE WHICH HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN POLAND SINCE 2015, CONSISTING OF THE REDUCTION OF THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DEBATES AS A REFERENCE IN POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. THE RULING IS THEREFORE A PORTENT OF POLAND'S FUTURE COMPLIANCE WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS IN HUMAN RIGHTS MATTERS.
170	THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE MOST IMPORTANT THEORIES THAT HAVE REFLECTED ON THE REASONS WHY THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED (LEAVING ASIDE THE THEORY OF THE STATE CLASSICAL AUTHORS, AS THEY DID NOT DEVELOP THEIR WRITINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM). IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE REASONS THAT COULD JUSTIFY DISOBEYING THE LAW. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT AN ETHICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW EXISTS IN A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. FOLLOWING THIS, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL MORAL REASON WITH MORE WEIGHT THAN THE FIRST, WHICH MAY JUSTIFY BREACHES OF THE LAW. NATURALLY, DISSIDENCE AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW FOR IDEOLOGICAL REASONS IS NOT ALWAYS JUSTIFIED, EVEN THOUGH MORAL REASONS ARE INVOLVED. THEREBY, TO CONCLUDE THE PAPER ASSESSES THE POSITION THE LEGAL SYSTEM CAN, AND SHOULD, ADOPT, WHEN CONFRONTED WITH AN ETHICALLY MOTIVATED INFRINGEMENT OF THE LAW.
171	THE PROBLEM OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LAW AND ORDER IS RELEVANT TO ANY MODERN SOCIETY. THE ARTICLE TRIES TO ANALYZE THIS RELATIONSHIP, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT JUDICIAL, POLICE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. THE NAMED CONCEPTS ARE CLOSELY INTERCONNECTED, BUT ARE NOT IDENTICAL. THEY ARE CORRELATED AS CAUSE AND EFFECT: THERE IS A RULE OF LAW, THERE IS NO RULE OF LAW. ONE SUGGESTS THE OTHER. THE RULE OF LAW AS CONCRETE REALITY LOGICALLY PRECEDES THE RULE OF LAW AS A DOCTRINE, THE CONNECTION HERE IS HARD, CAUSAL. THE PROCESS IS ONE. LAW AND ORDER: A REAL INDICATOR OF THE STATE OF LEGALITY, REFLECTS THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS, THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL LEGAL REGULATIONS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS THE END RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, THE OBJECTIVE OF LEGAL REGULATION, SINCE IT IS FOR THE FORMATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT LAWS ARE ISSUED, THUS LIKE OTHER REGULATORY LEGAL ACTS, VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND BODIES AND, ABOVE ALL, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, THE CONTROL SYSTEM, VARIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS.
172	SCHOLARS TYPICALLY DISCUSS THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT, RATHER THAN A PRACTICAL REALITY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FAILURE. THE MEMPHIS MASSACRE OF 1866 PROVIDES A VALUABLE CASE STUDY IN THE FAILURE OF FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER THE CIVIL WAR, IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, THERE WAS A MASSIVE INFLUX OF FORMER SLAVES, COTERMINOUS WITH THE STATE STRIPPING FORMER CONFEDERATES OF THEIR RIGHT TO HOLD OFFICE. IN MAY 1866, RACIAL TERROR ENFOLDED THE CITY, AND FOR THREE DAYS POLICE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS LED A MASSACRE OF DOZENS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN. THE CITY WAS SET ABLAZE, RESULTING IN MASS BURNING OF HOMES, SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, AND BUSINESSES; AND RAPES, BEATINGS, AND ROBBERIES OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. THE MEMPHIS MASSACRE WAS ONE OF MANY RACE RIOTS THAT OCCURRED IN THE RECONSTRUCTION SOUTH, PRECIPITATED IN PART BY THE RADICAL DEVELOPMENTS INTENDED TO PROMOTE EQUAL CITIZENSHIP FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR, THE RESISTANCE OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS, AND CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL ORDER. YET, THE LOCAL RESPONSE WHOLLY FAILED TO PROVIDE ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL REMEDIES TO THE VICTIMS OF THE MASSACRE. IN FACT, NO LOCAL ACTION WAS EVER TAKEN TO BRING THOSE RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE FOR THE HEINOUS ACTS COMMITTED. THE PERPETRATORS OF RACIAL VIOLENCE THEMSELVES BELIEVED THAT THEIR ACTIONS WERE ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW-FUELED BY A PERCEPTION THAT THE NEW FREEDOMS AND ECONOMIC LIBERTY OF FREEDMEN WERE CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTION. IN CONSIDERING THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE UTILIZES THE MEMPHIS MASSACRE AS A CASE STUDY TO EXAMINE HOW INDIVIDUALS INTERPRET, UNDERSTAND, AND ABIDE BY THE SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATION OF FORMAL LAW AND PROCEDURE. THE ARTICLE PLACES THE MASSACRE IN CONTEXT WITH OTHER RACE RIOTS-BOTH IN THE SAME PERIOD AND DECADES AFTER. WHAT WAS THE SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW? WAS IT THE NOTIONS OF RACIAL INFERIORITY OR WHITE RACIAL SUPREMACY PERPETUATED BY WHITE CITIZENS? OR WAS IT THE IDEALS OF EQUALITY THAT INFORMED THE PASSAGE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT? TURNING TO THE PASSAGE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES HOW POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS CANNOT PREVENT RACIAL TERROR WHERE INDIVIDUALS DO NOT ADHERE TO THE UNDERLYING IDEALS OF FUNDAMENTAL EQUALITY AMONG PERSONS. CONSIDERING THE AT-TIMES SUCCESS AND AT-TIMES FAILURE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO PROTECT EQUAL RIGHTS AMONG CITIZENS, THE FORMAL AND PROCEDURAL LAW CANNOT BE SELF-EXECUTING, BUT REQUIRES THE INDIVIDUAL-AND THE STATE-TO GUARANTEE THE EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP.
173	CHINA INCREASINGLY RELIES ON ITS LEGAL SYSTEM TO REGULATE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THERE IS, HOWEVER, WIDESPREAD FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE LAW, WHICH PERIODICALLY LEADS TO SOCIAL CRISES AND POPULAR UNREST. THE CHINESE STATE IS NOT, OF COURSE, ALONE IN EXPERIENCING THIS, BUT IT RESPONDS TO ENFORCEMENT FAILURES IN DISTINCTIVE WAYS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ONE SUCH RESPONSE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE ROLE PLAYED BY THE ENFORCEMENT CAMPAIGN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM. WE FOCUS ON ONE CAMPAIGN IN PARTICULAR: THE CAMPAIGN THAT WAS WAGED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2007 TO REDRESS THE CHRONIC FAILURE TO PAY WAGES. CHINESE ENFORCEMENT CAMPAIGNS ARE NOT SIMPLY DIRECTED AT SECURING GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAW. THEY ARE INTEGRALLY LINKED TO CYCLES OF LAW REFORM IN THE PRC. WHILST THEIR MAIN IMPACT IS ON ENFORCEMENT, THEY ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INFLUENCING THE DRAFTING OF LEGISLATION AND THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE DOCUMENTS THE IMPACT OF THIS CAMPAIGN ON THE PRODUCTION OF LAW: IN SPEEDING UP THE ITERATIVE PROCESS OF LAWMAKING, INTERPRETATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION, WITH PRODUCTION OF IMPORTANT REFORMS TO EXISTING LABOUR LAW IN 2007 AND 2008. IT IS THE STRONG PLANNED NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND ITS EMPHASIS ON STATE LEADERSHIP OF LAWMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT THAT CONTINUES TO SHAPE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
174	ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS OF TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY WEAK SUPPORT FOR RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS FROM CITIZENS OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE 'OWNERS', NEW INSTITUTIONS ARE OF LITTLE USE. A CRUCIAL TASK CURRENTLY FACING CEE DEMOCRACIES IS THEREFORE THE FORMULATION OF POLITICS AND STRATEGIES THAT COULD HELP SUSTAIN THE MORE THOROUGH DEMOCRATIZATION OF THESE SOCIETIES. IT IS CITIZENS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL TO BOOSTING THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION, AS REPRESENTATIVES OF CIVIL SOCIETY WHO SUPPORT, AND ARE INVOLVED IN, VARIOUS POLITICAL INITIATIVES, GROUPS, AND ACTIVITIES, THE SCOPE OF WHICH EXTENDS BEYOND POLITICAL PARTIES AND PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS TO ENCOMPASS A NUMBER OF OTHER BOTTOM-UP ASSOCIATIONS AND GROUPS. THE ESSAY PRESENTS A COUPLE OF EVERYDAY SCENES FROM THE 'POST-COMMUNIST' WORLD AIMED TO CAPTURE THE REALITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE OF CITIZENS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH VARIOUS RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER SITUATIONS IN THEIR SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS. THE STORYLINES PRESENTED BELOW ARE THOSE OF OUR FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES; THEY REVEAL THEIR DILEMMAS, CONCERNS AND EVERYDAY THOUGHTS.
175	THE 1928 TRIAL OF JOSE DE LEON TORAL, ASSASSIN OF MEXICAN CAUDILLO ALVARO OBREGON, AFFORDED PRESIDENT PLUTARCO ELIAS CALLES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES THAT THE REVOLUTION HAD YIELDED A NATION OF LAWS PREDICATED ON SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES. SUMMARY EXECUTIONS OF CATHOLICS HAD ALLOWED DETRACTORS AND EVEN SYMPATHETIC OBSERVERS TO QUESTION THE DEPTH OF CIVIC VALUES IN MEXICO. THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW AUTHORITIES DELIBERATELY PRESENTED THE HEARING AS THE CONCRETE REALIZATION OF CALLES'S CLAIM THAT HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONS THAT EMBODIED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION. ALTHOUGH THE CHRISTIAN IDIOMS PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION SUPPORT RECENT SCHOLARLY ARGUMENTS REGARDING DEIST TENDENCIES WITHIN REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGIES, THIS ARTICLE POINTS OUT THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S EMPHASIS ON ITS SPIRITUAL CONVICTION SOUGHT TO BOLSTER THE CLAIM THAT ANTICLERICALISM WAS NOT ANTIRELIGIOUS BUT RATHER NECESSARY FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
176	FACING SIMILAR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, BOTH CHINA AND PRE-DEMOCRATIC TAIWAN HAVE APPLIED THE SAME STRATEGY TO IMPLEMENT STRUCTURAL REFORMS, A MODEL CHARACTERIZED BY "THE RULE OF LAW WITHOUT DEMOCRACY." ONE FASHIONABLE OPINION HAS BEEN THAT THE MODEL IN CHINA WILL FOLLOW ITS LIFE CYCLE IN TAIWAN AND EVENTUALLY LEAD TO DEMOCRATIZATION, AFTER THE PROGRESS IN OVERALL REFORMS. ALTHOUGH SEASONED POLICYMAKERS HAVE OFTEN EXPRESSED THIS VIEWPOINT, IT HAS SURPRISINGLY NOT BEEN SCRUTINIZED IN DETAIL BY EXISTING LEGAL LITERATURE. BY COMPARING THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE OF TAIWAN'S TOTAL TRANSITION WITH THAT OF CHINA'S, THIS ARTICLE REFUTES THIS CONVERGENCE THEORY. FIRST OF ALL, THE EXAMINATION OF THE MODEL IN TAIWAN UNVEILS PROMINENT LIMITS THAT HAVE PREVENTED THE RULE OF LAW FROM TAKING ROOT UNTIL YEARS AFTER DEMOCRATIZATION. SECONDLY, THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES FOUR FACTORS THAT HAVE TRANSCENDED THE LIMITS OF THE MODEL IN TAIWAN, BUT THEY EITHER DO NOT EXIST, OR HAVE MINOR OR OPPOSITE EFFECTS IN CHINA. THESE FACTORS ARE (1) THE FUSION OF THE EARLY TRANSPLANTED LEGAL SYSTEM IN MAINLAND CHINA AND THE JAPANESE COLONIAL LEGACY OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT IN TAIWAN; (2) AN INWARD-LOOKING NATIONALISM THAT EMPOWERED THE REFORMIST WING OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC; (3) COMPETITIVE LOCAL ELECTIONS AS AN ALTERNATIVE PLATFORM FOR ENFORCING LAWS AND ADVANCING CONSTITUTIONALISM; AND (4) THE PRESSURE EXERTED BY GEOPOLITICS AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY PLACING CONSTRAINTS ON THE AUTHORITARIAN STATE. THE ABSENCE OF THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT IN A VERY DIFFERENT FINAL OUTCOME OF THE MODEL IN CHINA. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CHALLENGING THE THEORIES ABOUT AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY, WHICH GENERALLY DEPICT AUTHORITARIAN RULES AS TRANSITIONAL AND PRESUME A LINEAR TRANSITION. RATHER, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THE NONLINEAR, CONTEXT-DEPENDENT, AND FUNCTIONALIST APPROACH BE ADOPTED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND TRAJECTORIES OF THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT IN TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES.
177	THIS PAPER SHOWCASES THE WEAKNESSES OF EU ENLARGEMENT LAW AND DEMONSTRATES HOW ONE MEMBER STATE - NAMELY, GREECE - IS NOTABLE FOR ABUSING THIS WEAKNESS, FOR HARMING THE CANDIDATE COUNTRIES, THE EU, AND THE INSTITUTIONS ALIKE, FOR STRIPPING THE EU POSITION OF ITS PREDICTABILITY, AND FOR UNDERMINING THE EU COMMISSION'S EFFORTS. ACCORDINGLY, GREECE HAS SEVERELY INCAPACITATED THE KEY PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW COMPONENT OF THE EU'S ENLARGEMENT REGULATION, TURNING IT INTO A RANDOMISED POLITICAL GAME AND IGNORING ANY LONG-TERM GOALS OF STABILITY, PROSPERITY, AND PEACE THAT THE PROCESS IS TO STAND FOR. FOLLOWING A WALK THROUGH GREECE'S ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF ENLARGEMENT ROUNDS, THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE DUTY OF LOYALTY - WHICH IS PRESUMABLY ABLE TO DISCIPLINE MEMBER STATES THAT UNDERMINE THE COMMON EFFORT - SHOULD FIND A NEW MEANING IN THE CONTEXT OF EU ENLARGEMENT.
178	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE REACTIONS BY POLITICAL ACTORS TO THE RULING OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ON THE DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE CATALAN PARLIAMENT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT POLITICAL FRAMINGS OF THE RULING CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THE LEGALIST, ATTITUDINAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ACADEMIC MODELS OF JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR. AS WILL BE SHOWN, THESE MODELS HAVE A NORMATIVE DIMENSION, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THESE IMPLICATIONS ARE SKILFULLY CAPTURED AND EXPLOITED BY POLITICAL ACTORS AS PART OF A WIDER BATTLE FOR THE FRAMING OF THE RULING. THE RULE OF LAW THUS BECOMES POLITICISED AS A RESULT OF THE TENSION AROUND THE JUDICIALISATION OF THE SO-CALLED CATALAN 'SOVEREIGNIST PROCESS'.
179	THE STATUTORY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN AUSTRALIA CONFER POWERS OF DECISION-MAKING UPON GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, RESTRICT HOW THESE POWERS ARE TO BE EXERCISED BY REFERENCE EITHER TO STATED CRITERIA OR IN SOME INSTANCES TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THESE RESTRICTIONS PERFORM DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR STRUCTURE, FORM AND LANGUAGE: FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY BE IN THE FORM OF JURISDICTIONAL, DELIBERATIVE OR PURPOSIVE RULES. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS HOW THE OFFSHORE RESOURCES LEGISLATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND SOME EXAMPLES OF THE ONSHORE RESOURCES LEGISLATION OF QUEENSLAND ADDRESS THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN DETERMINING WHETHER THERE IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
180	AMOS PUBLISHED THE FIRST EDITION OF SCIENCE OF LAW WITH APPLETON'S INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERIES IN 1874. HE EMPHASIZED THE ROLES OF EMPIRICAL ASSEMBLY AND INDUCTIVE SYNTHESIS IN LEGAL GENERALIZATION, THE CAPACITY OF JURIDICAL INFORMATION TO BE PRESENTED IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER, ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMON LAW'S INDEPENDENCE FROM POLITICS, METAPHYSICS AND MORALITY, AND THE FACILITATIVE ROLE OF LAW IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION. AMOS THUS TRADED ON THE CONVENTIONS OF THE VICTORIAN NATURAL SCIENCES TO APPEAL TO POPULAR SENTIMENT AND THEREBY GARNER SUPPORT FOR JUDGE-MADE LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT THE SCIENTIFIC CONVENTIONS ON WHICH HE TRADED HAD TYPICALLY BEEN FILTERED THROUGH AND RECONFIGURED BY POPULAR UNDERSTANDINGS OF THOSE SCIENCES.
181	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ORIGINS, CHARACTERISTICS, AND PROBLEMS OF ISRAELI LEGAL CULTURE. THE ANALYSIS, BASED ON A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND EMPIRICAL FINDINGS, SEEKS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN GENERAL, AND IN ISRAEL IN PARTICULAR, FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE. IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE 'RULE OF LAW' WAS ORIGINALLY IMPOSED BY THE POLITICAL ELITE, AND GRADUALLY BECAME PART OF THE POLITICAL CULTURE. AT FIRST, THE 'RULE OF LAW' WAS A SET OF PROCEDURES IMPOSED AND MANAGED BY THE ELITE, BUT LATER A RHETORIC OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND A GREATER SENSITIVITY FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WERE GENERATED. CRUCIAL ISSUES ARE EXPOSED: THE SEVERE TENSIONS BETWEEN JEWISHNESS AND DEMOCRACY, MINORITY RIGHTS OF THE ARAB ISRAELIS, THE SUPERVISION, OVER THE ARMY AND THE SECURITY SERVICES, MILITARISM VERSUS DEMOCRACY, EXCESSIVE ADJUDICATION, LEGAL REFORMS, CIVIL RIGHTS IN ISRAEL, AND MILITARY OCCUPATION. THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE ISSUES POINTS TO THE DEEPER TENETS OF ISRAELI LEGAL CULTURE, AND TEACHES US ABOUT LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN A NON-WESTERN POLITICAL SETTING WHICH IS EXPERIENCING PROCESSES OF AMERICANIZATION.
182	IN R (UNISON) V LORD CHANCELLOR (EQUALITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION INTERVENING) THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT FEES FOR BRINGING CLAIMS IN THE EMPLOYMENT TRIBUNAL WERE UNLAWFUL BOTH UNDER COMMON LAW AND AS A MATTER OF EU LAW. THE JUDGMENT HAS VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ANY SYSTEM IN WHICH THE ENFORCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT OR SOCIAL RIGHTS IS LEFT TO INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, THE PARADIGMATIC MODEL ADOPTED IN THE UK. RECENT GOVERNMENT POLICY HAS IGNORED THE PUBLIC FUNCTION OF INDIVIDUAL TRIBUNAL CLAIMS IN DELIVERING EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AT THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL, EXEMPLIFIED BY THE THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND JUSTIFICATIONS WHICH LAY BEHIND THE INTRODUCTION OF FEES. THE SUPREME COURT'S ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE COMMON LAW RIGHT OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS IN SHARP CONFLICT WITH THESE POLICIES. I DISCUSS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES AND THE PARALLEL PRINCIPLES IN EU LAW AND UNDER ARTICLE 6 OF THE ECHR. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE JUDGMENT FOR CASES REJECTED, DISMISSED OR NOT BROUGHT OWING TO FEES, AND ITS LONGER-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPEDIMENTS TO ACCESS TO COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT WITH BREXIT ON THE HORIZON. THE JUDGMENT REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT TRIUMPH OF THE RULE OF LAW OVER THE INCREASED MARKETISATION OF LEGAL RIGHTS.
183	THE DEBATE ON THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU IS MAINLY TAKING PLACE FROM AN EU LAW POINT OF VIEW, STEMMING FROM THE ANALYSIS OF CJEU JUDGMENTS AND ITS INTERPRETATION OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PRIMARY EU LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ONLY BY COMPREHENDING THE GLOBAL CONTEXT OF RISE OF POPULISM AND DELEGITIMATION OF THE JUDICIARY MAY WE REALISE THE RISKS THAT NATIONAL JUDGES AND CJEU STARTED TO TAKE WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE OF THIS DISCUSSION. AN OVERVIEW IS MADE OF THE GLOBAL TREND OF DELEGITIMATION OF THE JUDICIARY, REFERRING TO THE EXAMPLE OF POLAND. THE AUTHOR THEN ANALYSES HOW THE CJEU AND NATIONAL COURTS, WHILE DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW, ARE ALSO MUTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR OWN PROTECTION AGAINST EXTERNAL THREATS, AND WHY THAT DIALOGUE IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP THE DEBATE JURIDICAL, AS A WAY OF AVOIDING WHAT THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES AS THE "POPULIST TRAP TO THE JUDICIARY".
184	SCHOLARS HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN HOW IN EUROPE REGIMES IN DEMOCRATIC DECAY (E.G. POLAND, HUNGARY) TAKE ALL SORTS OF MEASURES TARGETING AND MARGINALIZING POLITICAL OPPONENTS. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AUTHORITARIAN BY NATURE, THE MEASURES ARE CAST IN A LEGAL FORM. ACCORDING TO SOME SCHOLARS THIS KIND OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE OF LAW CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD AS A DUAL STATE, NAMELY A COMBINATION OF THE NORMATIVE STATE (THE RULE OF LAW) AND THE PREROGATIVE STATE (THE PURE-POLITICAL OR ARBITRARY-WILL OF THOSE IN POWER). BUILDING ON THESE INSIGHTS, THE PRESENT PAPER MAKES TWO NEW OBSERVATIONS. FIRST, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS DISTINCTIVELY WELL SUITED TO CATER FOR THE CREATION OF A DUAL STATE. BY DISTINCTIVELY I MEAN BETTER THAN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW. IN FACT, I ARGUE THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW CONSTITUTES A DUAL STATE IN AND OF ITSELF COMBINING NORMATIVE AND PREROGATIVE STATE ELEMENTS WITHIN A SINGLE AREA OF LAW, IN WAYS THAT CANNOT BE DONE UNDER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW. SECOND, NOT ONLY REGIMES IN DEMOCRATIC DECAY BUT ALSO LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES MAKE USE OF THE DUAL STATE NATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE PAPER ILLUSTRATES THIS POINT WITH TWO TECHNIQUES WHEREBY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES USE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TO CIRCUMVENT OR PERVERT THE NORMAL OPERATION OF CRIMINAL LAW, NAMELY CRIMMIGRATION AND THE ALIEN DETENTION OF CITIZENS. MY UNDERLYING NORMATIVE POINT IS TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE INHERENT AUTHORITARIAN POTENTIAL OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW.
185	CRITICISM HAS LONG BEEN LAID ABOUT CHINA'S UNWILLINGNESS TO SUBSCRIBE TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS, THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES. THE UNITED NATIONS AND WESTERN STATES AND SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT HUMAN RIGHTS AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY UNDERLAIN BY A WESTERN RULE-OF-LAW MODEL ARE PREREQUISITES TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNMENTAL LEGITIMACY. IS AUTHORITARIANISM IN CHINA INCOMPATIBLE WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY? IS THE RULE OF LAW REJECTED ENTIRELY BY THE STATE APPARATUSES IN CHINA? IS THERE REALLY NO HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION UNDER CHINA'S CONSTITUTION AND LAWS? HAS CHINA'S APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW EVOLVED SINCE ITS REALISATION OF THE ROLES IT MAY PLAY IN SHAPING INTERNATIONAL LAW? WHAT DO THE CHINESE PEOPLE THINK OR WANT ABOUT CHINA'S POLITICAL REFORM VIS-A-VIS HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES? WITH CHINA'S RISE IN THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL ORDER, THESE QUESTIONS RAISE IMPORTANT ISSUES THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES.
186	THE RULE-OF-LAW-BACKSLIDING IN SOME MEMBER STATES HAS SUBVERTED NOT ONLY ONE OF THE EU FUNDAMENTAL VALUES BUT ALSO TRUST AMONG NATIONAL AUTHORITIES WHEN IMPLEMENTING EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANTS (EAW). HOWEVER, WHEN EVALUATING THE EXECUTION OF EAWS ISSUED BY COUNTRIES EXPERIENCING RULE-OF-LAW CRISES, THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU (CJEU) SOUGHT TO PRESERVE JUDICIAL COOPERATION AND IMPOSED A RATHER "TOP-DOWN" VIEW ON MUTUAL TRUST AMONG MEMBER STATES. THIS APPROACH SEEMINGLY DISREGARDS THE (DIS)TRUST WHICH HAS EMERGED IN THE EU DUE TO RULE-OF-LAW-BACKSLIDING AND FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PSYCHO-SOCIOLOGICAL NATURE OF TRUST. DRAWING ON THE TRUST LITERATURE, THE PAPER OFFERS NOVEL CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS TO RETHINK MUTUAL TRUST IN THE EAW FRAMEWORK. NOTABLY, IT CRITICALLY ASSESSES SOME OF THE GAPS IN THE CJEU'S INTERPRETATION OF MUTUAL TRUST AND ADVANCES SUGGESTIONS TO EMBED EMPIRICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CONCEPTUALISATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN TRUST IN PRACTICE AND IN PRINCIPLE.
187	THE FUNDAMENTALS OF EUROPEAN UNION IS COMPOSED OF BY. BASIC VALUES. REGULATED IN ARTICLE 2 IN LISBON TREATY. IT HAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE COMPARED TO THE PRINCIPLES AND VALUES OF RULE OF LAW WHICH LEADS TO DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE UNION IN RECENT YEARS. IN THIS STUDY, IT IS AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE PROGRESS, IMPORTANCE AND LEGAL NATURE OF BASIC VALUES ON WHICH EUROPEAN UNION IS BASED, CONTROL MECHANISM IN THE CASE OF INFRINGEMENT OF THESE VALUES, PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROCEDURE OF PROTECTING RULE OF LAW THAT IS PROVIDED BY EUROPEAN COMMISSION BY ACCOMMODATING THE CASE OF POLAND AS A CURRENT ISSUE.
188	FACED WITH THE OPACITY OF OTHER MINDS, WE CAN EITHER CONFIRM THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF KNOWING OR TRY TO MAKE OTHER MINDS TRANSPARENT. AMONG THE AMAZONIAN SHUAR, TWO OPPOSED REGIMES OF INTENTION MANAGEMENT EMBODY THESE TWO OPTIONS. ONE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREDATORY AGENCY OF ARUTAM, THE SPIRIT OF PROMINENT ELDERS; THE OTHER ONE WITH THE PACIFYING AGENCY OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD. SECRET VISION QUESTS AND DIALOGIC DUELS GENERATE AN INSTABILITY OF PERSPECTIVES AND A RULE OF SELF, PREMISED ON THE OPACITY OF PERSONS. BY CONTRAST, PROJECTS OF STATE LEGIBILITY, THE OMNISCIENT CHRISTIAN GOD, AND THE PUBLIC CHARACTER OF BIBLICAL REVELATIONS CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THAT IS, A REGIME OF INTENTIONS IN WHICH PERSONS ARE TRANSPARENT AND PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN PUBLIC. THE NOVELTY OF THIS MODE OF GOVERNING OPACITY BEARS EMPHASIS ON AND CONTRASTS WITH THE ARGUMENTS STRESSING CONTINUITY IN AMAZONIAN ENGAGEMENTS WITH ALTERITY.
189	THE RULE OF LAW AS A GLOBALLY RECOGNISED CONCEPT IS MULTI-FACETED (CHESTERMAN, 2008). IN THE COMMON-LAW TRADITION, IT IS CONCEIVED THROUGH A FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE FRAMEWORK. IN ESSENCE, IT CENTRES ON THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW OVER THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF POWER AND THE FORMAL LEGALITY OF THE LAW (TAMANAHA, 2004, P. 115; COTTERRELL, 1992, P. 157). THE RULE-OF-LAW CONCEPT HAS BEEN CRITICISED AS BEING OF UNIQUE EUROPEAN ORIGIN, WHERE PLURAL SOCIAL ORGANISATION AND UNIVERSAL NATURAL LAW CONSTITUTE ITS TWO PRECONDITIONS (UNGER, 1977, PP. 80-110). IT HAS, HOWEVER, BEEN ADVOCATED AROUND THE WORLD AS ONE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE LEADING TO MODERNITY, WHERE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LAW BASED ON THE FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW SERVES AS A STRONG SYMBOL FOR A MODERN SOCIETY (DEFLEM, 1996, P. 5).
190	THE CONFLICT BETWEEN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG REGARDING THE ISSUE OF HOW MUCH AUTONOMY HONG KONG WOULD RETAIN IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY INTENSE, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE OCCUPY CENTRAL MOVEMENT AROSE IN 2014. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE "RULE OF LAW" POLICY UNDER XI'S GOVERNMENT AND ANALYZES HOW AND WHY THE CCP'S RULE OVER HONG KONG WAS STRENGTHENED. ALTHOUGH XI PROMOTES THE "RULE OF LAW," IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE IN DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER, FIRST, OUTLINING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE "RULE OF LAW" DURING XI JINPING'S ERA AND EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW IN DEMOCRACY AND THE ONE IN CHINA. SECOND ANALYSIS IS REVEALING THE PERSONAL AFFAIRS AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PARTY APPARATUS TO SEE THE LINKAGE OF THE "RULE OF LAW" POLICY UNDER XI'S GOVERNMENT WITH THE CCP'S CONTROL OVER HONG KONG, AND THIRD IS EXAMINING THE REFLECTION AND RHETORIC OF THE CCP'S "RULE OF LAW" GOVERNANCE OVER HONG KONG BASED ON THE POLITICIANS' DISCOURSES. THIS PAPER REVEALS THAT THE "RULE OF LAW" WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IMPLIES STANDARDIZING THE LAW, CENTRALIZING THE POWER, AND STABILIZING SOCIETY. THE CCP HAS CONTINUALLY CLAIMED TO BE "GOVERNING HONG KONG ACCORDING TO LAW" BUT THE CCP WOULD ONLY ACCEPT THE "RULE OF LAW" WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND, OF COURSE, WITHOUT DEMOCRATIZATION.
191	THE EXISTENCE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL IS THE ESSENTIAL CORNERSTONE IN ANY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. WITHOUT A CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN A PLURALIST DEMOCRACY WITH A REAL RULE OF LAW. THE TUNISIAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE DIFFICULT AND HAMPERED LIFE OF THE TUNISIAN CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE THAT CROSSED TWO AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES: A "REVOLUTION"; AND THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY. IT IS IN THE LATTER PHASE THAT THE CREATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PROVED TO BE THE PARAMOUNT ELEMENT IN THE PASSAGE FROM A PROCEDURAL DEMOCRACY TO A SUBSTANTIVE DEMOCRACY.
192	ON THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHOR MAKES A THEORETICAL JOURNEY ACROSS THE HISTORY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. IT NOT ONLY AFFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONSTITUTION AS A GUARANTEE TO THE EXERCISE OF LIBERTIES, BUT ALSO EXPOSES THE DOCTRINES OPPOSED TO CONSTITUTIONALISM AS WELL AS THE MODERN DOCTRINES THAT PRETEND TO PUSH FORWARD THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW.
193	RENDERED IN DECEMBER 2019, THE VAVILOV DECISION SETS THE CONTEMPORARY ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION ON THE MERITS. ON THIS OCCASION, THE SUPREME COURT EXPRESSED THE DESIRE TO ADD A CERTAIN DEGREE OF CERTAINTY AND CONSISTENCY TO THIS FIELD OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE NEW APPROACH'S PROPENSITY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THE ANALYSIS BEGINS WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THERE EXISTS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INSTABILITY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY CHARACTERIZED THE LAW OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THE FAILURE OF PREVIOUS APPROACHES TO ADEQUATELY GUIDE REVIEWING COURTS IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THEIR MISSION, WHICH CONSISTS OF BALANCING THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY. IN LIGHT OF EARLIER CASE LAW, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE VAVILOV DECISION OFFERS THE PROSPECT OF GREATER CERTAINTY IN DETERMINING THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF REVIEW, BUT THAT THE RISK OF INSTABILITY REMAINS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD. INDEED, WHILE THE SUPREME COURT'S GUIDANCE IN THIS REGARD GENERALLY REFLECTS A CONCERN TO ALLEVIATE THE TENSION UNDERLYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY PRINCIPLES, SOME OF THE MAJORITY JUSTICES' ASSERTIONS, NAMELY THAT CERTAIN STATUTORY PROVISIONS "RELATING TO THE SCOPE OF A DECISION MAKER'S AUTHORITY" MAY INVOLVE ONLY ONE INTERPRETATION, MAY WEAKEN THE SELF-DISCIPLINE OF REVIEWING COURTS ON WHICH JUDICIAL DEFERENCE IS BASED.
194	THE AUTHOR WELCOMES THE INCLUSION OF THE PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH AMONG THE BINDING PROVISIONS OF THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED STRADDLING STOCKS AGREEMENT, BUT ARGUES THAT TO CONCEIVE OF THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE SOLELY AS AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL RULE OF LAW IS TO MISS ITS MOST VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND POLICY. THE PRINCIPLE IS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE IN FRAMING ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RELEVANT LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND IN ENHANCING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF CONSERVATION MEASURES. THE AUTHOR SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE MANNER IN WHICH PRECAUTION AS A PRINCIPLE OR GENERAL CONCEPT MAY INFLUENCE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRADDLING STOCKS AGREEMENT AND OTHER LEGAL TEXTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN ECOSYSTEM ORIENTATION WITHIN INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES LAW.
195	THIS PAPER SURVEYS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION ON FRONTIER ZONES IN SOUTH AMERICA: THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION; THE SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THE TEMPORALITY OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN SOME OF THE ELEMENTS SHAPING THE ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF FRONTIER ZONES. THESE ISSUES ARE DISCUSSED BY EXPLORING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE DRAWN FROM THE URUGUAY-BRAZIL BORDER (SOUTH CONE) AND THE NORTHERN ANDEAN SEGMENT OF THE COLOMBIA-VENEZUELA BORDER. REGIONAL INTEGRATION HAS FOSTERED INTER-STATE DIALOGUE, THE PROMOTION OF TRADE AND THE GROWTH OF CROSS BORDER INVESTMENTS BUT FRONTIER ZONES REMAIN PARTIALLY HOSTAGE OF UNILATERAL NATIONAL POLICIES. THE ILLICIT DRUG TRADE AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ARE SHOWN TO PROMOTE INFORMAL REGIONAL INTEGRATION BY ITS INCREASING ASSOCIATION WITH LEGAL ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TO DETAIN THE PROCESS STUMBLE ON THE CONVERGENCE OF EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE 'NORMAL ORDER' IN THE CONTEMPORARY STRUCTURE OF SOVEREIGN POWER.
196	AS AN IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SELF-GOVERNANCE EXPLORATION FOR THE CHINESE NATION, THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO HUMAN RULE-OF-LAW CIVILIZATION, AND SHOULD BE REINTERPRETED FROM THREE DIMENSIONS: HISTORICAL TRADITION, PREVAILING PRACTICE, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. FOLLOWING THE CONSTANT LOGIC OF RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA, CHINESE RULE-OF-LAW MODERNIZATION MARKS A NEW ERA OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM AND IS A SPECIFIC EMBODIMENT OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION IN THE DOMAIN OF RULE OF LAW. THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) HAS EXPLORED THE CHINA'S SOCIALIST RULE-OF-LAW PRACTICE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, CARRIED FORWARD THE ESSENCE OF FINE CHINESE RULE-OF-LAW CULTURE, AND LEARNED FROM OTHERS' IMPORTANT RULE-OF-LAW ACHIEVEMENTS, MODERNIZING THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE NEEDS OF CHINA. FURTHERMORE, XI JINPING THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW, ADAPTING TO THE TIMES TO PROMOTE THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE NATION, UNDERSTANDS AND GRASPS THE BASIC LAWS OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE, THE LAWS OF SOCIALIST RULE-OF-LAW BUILDING AND THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW-BASED HUMANE CIVILIZATION DEVELOPMENT. THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS THEREBY BEEN REVISED AND EXPANDED THROUGH LINKING HISTORY WITH REALITY, THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE WITH THE DOMESTIC ONE, AND THEORY WITH PRACTICE. SURELY, THE UPDATED CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM WITH CHINA CHARACTERISTICS AND WITH WORLD SIGNIFICANCE WILL RETURN TO GLOBAL CENTRE-STAGE IN RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT. ALSO, THE UPDATED CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW ERA WILL EMBRACE THE REVIVAL OF CHINESE RULE-OF-LAW CIVILIZATION, WHILE THE CHINESE RULE-OF-LAW MODERNIZATION WILL ADVANCE THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE NATION.
197	CHINA'S FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS ACHIEVED UNDER WEAK LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE LITERATURE ATTRIBUTES THIS COUNTER-EXAMPLE OF LAW-FINANCE-GROWTH NEXUS TO (A) ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS IN CHINA SUCH AS INCENTIVES, REPUTATION AND RELATIONSHIPS AND (B) A WELL-FUNCTIONING XINFANG SYSTEM WITH COMMON LAW FEATURES. IN RECENT YEARS, CHINA HAS MADE INCREASING EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN ITS RULE OF LAW. THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) HAS TAKEN THE LEAD BY LAUNCHING A FAR-REACHING CAMPAIGN AGAINST CORRUPTION, ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF INSPECTION TOURS, AND PROMULGATING A LARGE NUMBER OF REGULATIONS. WE ARGUE THAT USING REGULATIONS TO COMPLEMENT LAWS IS EFFECTIVE: CPC HAS ENOUGH BUREAUCRATIC PROWESS TO CRACK DOWN ON CORRUPTION WHEREAS THE COURTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBVERSION BY POWERFUL INTERESTS. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE DRAWBACKS OF THIS APPROACH: REGULATIONS AIMING AT EX ANTE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE PROCEDURAL FORMALISM AND LIMIT THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES.
198	RESEARCH LINKING CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT IS A HALLMARK OF RECENT EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, MANY POSTCOMMUNIST STATES HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY MAKING SUCH COMMITMENTS AND SPURRING GROWTH. MANY ARGUE POLITICAL POLARIZATION PREVENTS STATES FROM REFORMING LAWS AND PROTECTING PROPERTY RIGHTS IN SOME COUNTRIES WHEREAS SINGLE-PARTY GOVERNANCE RENDERS STATE PROMISES INCREDIBLE IN OTHERS. I ANALYZE POOLED CROSS-SECTIONAL TIME-SERIES DATA FOR TWENTY-FOUR POSTCOMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE EFFECTIVE CONSTRAINTS AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS ACT AS DEMOCRATIC COMMITMENT MECHANISMS RENDERING GOVERNMENT POLICIES CREDIBLE.
199	IN BRITAIN'S EMPIRE ACROSS ASIA AND AFRICA FROM THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY, TWO POLITICAL-LEGAL PRINCIPLES WERE CENTRAL TO COLONIAL MODERNITY, LAW AND ORDER, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE TWO PRINCIPLES SECURED THE LEGITIMATION OF COLONIAL RULE, IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO RULED. IT IS STRIKING THEN TO SEE THAT IN LATE COLONIAL BURMA, IN THE 1920S AND 1930S, THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER AND TO EMBED THE RULE OF LAW. VIOLENT CRIME SOARED WHILE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FAILED HOPELESSLY FOR SERIOUS OFFENCES. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH SENIOR BRITISH OFFICIALS IN BURMA NAVIGATED THE DISJUNCTURE BETWEEN THE IMPERIAL PRINCIPLES THAT WERE CENTRAL TO COLONIAL JUSTIFICATION AND BURMA'S REALITY. PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY, THEY DID SO BY PUTTING BLAME FOR THE SOARING CRIME RATES AND THE FAILURES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FIRMLY ON THE BURMESE. IN THE EARLY 1940S, HOWEVER, WITH THE END OF COLONIAL RULE CLEARLY IMMINENT, THE LEGITIMATION OF THE COLONIAL PRESENCE BECAME OF LESS PRESSING IMPORTANCE, AND THE FAILURE OF COLONIAL PRACTICE TO LIVE UP TO ITS IDEOLOGICAL RHETORIC COULD NOW BE MORE OPENLY FACED.
200	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A SUBSTANTIAL NEW INTERPRETATION OF AESCHYLUS' ORESTEIA, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LITERARY TEXTS TO DEAL WITH THE QUESTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND ONE OF WESTERN JURISPRUDENCE'S FOUNDING DOCUMENTS. PERHAPS IN PART BECAUSE OF IT HAS FALLEN UNDER THE SHADOW OF ANTIGONE, THE PLAY HAS TENDED TO SUFFER FROM A REDUCTIONIST READING IN WHICH LEGAL REASON TRIUMPHS OVER THE PASSIONS. THE PRESENT ARTICLE REREADS THE TEXT DRAWING ON RECENT SCHOLARSHIP ON AESCHYLUS' WORK. IT ARGUES THAT THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE FURIES HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD: THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY EXPRESSIONS OF VIOLENCE AND PASSION; ON THE CONTRARY, THEY ARE THE MOST LEGALISTIC OF ALL THE FIGURES IN THE PLAY. THE MODEL OF JUDGMENT INTRODUCED BY ATHENA IN THE RESOLUTION OF ORESTEIA DOES NOT PIT LAW AGAINST EMOTION, OR FEUD AGAINST PROCESS, BUT JUDGMENT AGAINST LAW. THE TRILOGY BEGINS BY PRESENTING THE UNCERTAINTY OF LANGUAGE AS LAW'S CURSE, AND THE CERTAIN APPLICATION OF THE LAW ITS CURE; IT CONCLUDES BY RADICALLY REFRAMING THE QUESTION. NOW THE ILLUSORY CERTAINTY OF LAW IS THE CURSE - AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF LANGUAGE ITS CURE. ATHENA'S WAY POSITIONS LEGAL JUDGMENT AS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MERE FOLLOWING OF RULES. THE ARTICLE THEN GOES ON TO SHOW THAT THIS APPROACH NOT ONLY CASTS A NEW LIGHT ON ORTHODOX JURISPRUDENCE. IT IS OF PROFOUND RELEVANCE TO THE WORK OF GIORGIO AGAMBEN AND THE THEORY OF SOVEREIGNTY HE HAS FAMOUSLY EXPOUNDED IN HOMO SACER. WHAT ULTIMATELY SEPARATES ATHENA'S RULE OF LAW FROM MERE DECISIONISM OR AGAMBEN'S EXECUTIVE AND UNLIMITED SOVEREIGNTY ARE THE EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS TO WHICH SHE PURPOSELY SUBMITS HERSELF. ATHENA DEMONSTRATES A VISION OF JUDGMENT AS A PARTICIPATORY AND TRANSFORMATIVE PROCESS. ABOVE ALL, SHE INSISTS ON THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PUBLIC LEGAL ARGUMENT AND PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN A DISCOURSE OF LEGAL LEGITIMACY, WHICH IS NOT SIMPLY LIMITED TO JUDGES OR PARTICULAR LEGAL DECISIONS. ON THE CONTRARY, ATHENA CONNECTS THE RULE OF LAW TO A CONTINUING DISCUSSION OF LEGAL VALUES AND JUDGMENTS WHICH IS NEVER FINALLY SETTLED, AND IN WHICH ALL OF US, AS CITIZENS OF ATHENS, ARE PARTICIPANTS.
201	AN INCREASING POLITICAL CONTESTATION OF THE EXISTING PRIVATE-PROPERTY ORDER CAN CURRENTLY BE OBSERVED. WITH SERIOUS DEMANDS FOR EXPROPRIATION, EVEN OUTSIDE MARGINALIZED SPLINTER GROUPS, A CONCEPT IS RETURNING THAT HAS LARGELY DISAPPEARED FROM THE FOCUS OF POLITICAL THEORY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE ARTICLE AIMS AT A DECIDEDLY POLITICAL-SCIENTIFIC EXAMINATION OF THE LEGAL INSTITUTION OF EXPROPRIATION BY LOCATING THE CONCEPT IN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. SHIFTING BETWEEN THE POLES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ON THE ONE HAND AND A POTENTIALITY OF DEMOCRATIC CONTESTATION OF THE PROPERTY ORDER ON THE OTHER, IT IS MADE CLEAR THAT THE CONCEPT OF EXPROPRIATION HIGHLIGHTS THE APORIAS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE THESIS IS PRESENTED BY MEANS OF A THEORETICAL-HISTORICAL CONTOURING USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE INTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ON EXPROPRIATION IN THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC AND, IN PARTICULAR, WITH A MORE IN-DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THE POSITIONS OF CARL SCHMITT AND OTTO KIRCHHEIMER, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY FIGURED AS ANTIPODES. WHILE SCHMITT SEEKS TO MAKE PLAUSIBLE A FAR-REACHING REJECTION OF EXPROPRIATION POTENTIALS WITH A NARROW CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, KIRCHHEIMER FOCUSES ON AN EXTENSIVE INTERPRETATION OF DEMOCRATIC POWER OF DISPOSITION OVER THE PRIVATE-PROPERTY ORDER. THE WEIMAR CRISIS YEARS ARE EXAMINED AS A KIND OF "LABORATORY" IN ORDER TO PROFIT FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF CRISIS-INDUCED SEARCHING AND TO WORK OUT A POLITICAL SCIENCE THEORETICAL LANGUAGE FOR CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSIONS OF EXPROPRIATION.
202	IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING AWARENESS BOTH IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW IN CHINESE EFFORTS TO BRING ORDER IF NOT JUSTICE TO SOCIETY AND THE WORLD. EVEN THE MOST ADMIRING STUDENTS OF CHINESE LEGAL HISTORY, HOWEVER, HAVE REJECTED THE IDEA THAT THE CHINESE EVER SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AS OPPOSED TO RULE BY LAW INCLUDING, ESPECIALLY AND CRITICALLY, THE SUBORDINATION OF THE RULER TO LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES. THIS ARTICLE USES A FRESH CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE ENTIRE CHINESE HISTORICAL RECORD FROM EARLIEST KNOWN TIMES TO THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY CE TO ARGUE THAT, ACCORDING TO A COMMONLY AGREED UPON DEFINITION OF "THE RULE OF LAW," WE CAN DISCERN SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF REGIMES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S PAST THAT INCLUDED BOTH THE IDEAL AND, IN MANY CASES, THE REALITY OF HOLDING THE RULER ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LAW. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS SUGGESTED SHIFT IN THE PARADIGM OF CHINESE LEGAL HISTORY FIR CHINESE POLITICS IN THE PERIOD SINCE 1950 CE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN ANOTHER VENUE.
203	IN THIS PAPER, IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT SECURITY, ALTHOUGH IT HAS VARIED ITS ADJECTIVISM, AS "PUBLIC", "CITIZEN", "NATIONAL", IS A HUMAN RIGHT THAT MUST BE GUARANTEED BY THE STATE. BUT TODAY THE MECHANISMS OF ENFORCEABILITY AND JUSTICIABILITY THAT THE MEXICAN STATE HAS FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE INEFFECTIVE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE MEXICAN STATE CONCEIVES CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, GIVEN THE REFORM OF ARTICLE ONE IN 2011 AS "PRINCIPLES", THAT IS, AS "MANDATES OF OPTIMIZATION" (ALEXY), OR AS "CONSTITUTIVE RULES". THE IMPACTS THAT FOLLOW ARE THAT IF THEY ARE "PRINCIPLES" THEY CAN BE REALIZED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE; IF THEY ARE "NORMS" UNDERSTOOD AS "CONSTITUTIVE RULES" AND ARE NOT OBEYED, THERE IS RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE AND THEY IMPACT ON THE EXISTENCE, OR NOT, OF A RULE OF LAW.
204	SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE IN 1922, GOVERNMENTS HAVE CONSENTED TO, AND ACTIVELY USED, AN EVER LARGER NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL COURTS, QUASI-JUDICIAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES AND AD HOC ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES OVER THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. SUCH JUDICIAL CLARIFICATION OF DISPUTED INTERPRETATIONS OF INCOMPLETE, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS REDUCES NOT ONLY THE NEGOTIATION COSTS OF GOVERNMENTS BY DELEGATING THE CLARIFICATION OF CONTESTED FACTS AND LEGAL CLAIMS TO INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY ADJUDICATION. JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING AT INTERGOVERNMENTAL, TRANSNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND PRIVATE LEVELS ALSO SUPPLEMENTS RULE-MAKING AND OFFERS CITIZENS JUDICIAL REMEDIES FOR DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS AND INTERESTS. MODERN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW INCREASINGLY COMPLEMENTS INTERGOVERNMENTAL, LEGISLATIVE, AND ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE BY MULTILEVEL 'JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE' SO AS TO PROTECT RULE OF LAW MORE EFFECTIVELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF CITIZENS (SECTION I). THIS CONTRIBUTION CRITICIZES THE ONE-SIDEDLY POWER-ORIENTED PERCEPTIONS OF WTO LAW AS 'INTERNATIONAL LAW AMONG STATES, (SECTION II) AND THE RELATED PERCEPTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL JUDGES AS DEPENDENT AGENTS OF STATES (SECTION III). CIVIL SOCIETY, PARLIAMENTS AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS SHOULD ENCOURAGE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JUDGES TO COOPERATE IN THEIR LEGAL TASK OF INTERPRETING CITIZEN-ORIENTED INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW 'IN CONFORMITY WITH PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW', AS EXPLICITLY PRESCRIBED IN THE VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES (VCLT). THE LEGAL COHERENCE OF MULTILEVEL JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE DEPENDS ON PROTECTING PRINCIPLES OF PROCEDURAL AS WELL AS SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE AND A COMMON CONCEPTION OF 'RULE OF LAW' NOT ONLY IN INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS AMONG STATES, BUT ALSO VIS-A-VIS THEIR CITIZENS ENGAGED IN, AND BENEFITING FROM, INTERNATIONAL TRADE (SECTIONS IV-VIII).
205	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH POLICING THE EXTERNAL BORDERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), AN ISSUE THAT RECENTLY HAS WITNESSED SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTERNALISATION OF THE FIGHT AGAINST UNDOCUMENTED MIGRATION. AFTER A PRESENTATION OF THE CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS UNDERPINNING THE RESEARCH (1), THE PAPER PRESENTS THE EU AGENCY FRONTEX AND ITS ORIGIN, TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES (2). THE NEXT SECTION WILL FOCUS ON FRONTEX-LED OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT AT THE SOUTHERN MARITIME BORDER (3), IN ORDER TO CRITICALLY LOOK AT ISSUES ARISING IN THIS CONTEXT (4), WITH REFERENCE TO THEIR LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS OF MY ANALYSIS WILL BE DISCUSSED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTERNALISATION OF MIGRATION POLICIES, ARGUING THAT THE EU AND MEMBER STATES (MSS) HAVE ENGAGED INTO A MULTIPLE EXERCISE OF VENUE SHOPPING, TO CONCLUDE WITH A (HOPEFUL) OUTLOOK ON THE FUTURE, WITH THE LISBON TREATY PROVIDING NEW POSSIBILITIES TO FIX CURRENT PROBLEMS (5).
206	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE A CONCEPTION OF THE VALUE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY THAT COULD BE SOUNDLY CONSIDERED COHERENT WITH THE NORMATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RULE-OF-LAW STATE. I ARGUE THAT WE NEED TO DEPART FROM A SOMEHOW -AS I WILL ARGUE-PURELY FORMAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY SUCH VALUE AND TO CONSIDER THAT THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDED WITH A SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT.
207	THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF TORTURE IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW; HOWEVER, IN THE COURSE OF THE RECENT DEBATE ON RESCUE TORTURE", IT HAS BEEN QUALIFIED CONSIDERABLY. ON THE BASIS OF A REAL CASE, THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE HOW ADOLESCENTS INTERPRET THE DILEMMA AND IN HOW FAR THEY TAKE ASPECTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW INTO CONSIDERATION. IT WAS EXPECTED THAT, WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE SYSTEMIC-TRANSPERSONAL JUDGMENTS, THE REJECTION OF TORTURE AND THE APPEAL TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW WOULD INCREASE. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THIS HYPOTHESIS; HOWEVER, THEY ALSO REVEAL STRONG CONTEXT-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS AND A HIGH DISCREPANCY BETWEEN A GENERAL AND A CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
208	ASSERTIONS OF EXTRATERRITORIAL JURISDICTION HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY FREQUENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY. ALTHOUGH A USEFUL RESPONSE TO TRANSNATIONAL CRIME, SUCH ASSERTIONS ARE OFTEN HIGHLY POLITICISED AND USED BY STATES TO FURTHER UNILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES. FURTHER, SOME ASSERTIONS OF EXTRATERRITORIALITY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND DO NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS. WHILE PRINCIPLES SUCH AS COMITY AND REASONABLENESS MAY ASSIST IN PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF STATES, THEY DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EXTRATERRITORIALITY SHOULD BE TREATY-BASED RATHER THAN UNILATERAL, AND DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES MUST APPLY EQUALLY TO EXTRATERRITORIAL ASSERTIONS OF JURISDICTION AND TERRITORIAL ASSERTIONS. FURTHER, PRINCIPLES TO GUIDE EXERCISES OF PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION IN RELATION TO AN ASSERTION OF EXTRATERRITORIALITY NEED TO BE DEVELOPED AND MADE AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF A MODEL LAW.
209	ENGLISH LAW IS CENTRAL TO THE HISTORY OF COLONIAL HONG KONG. TRADITIONAL COLONIAL HISTORIANS CONCEPTUALISE IT AS A GIFT TO THE COLONISED, AND IT IS STILL WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY HONG KONG CITIZENS TODAY AS A CORE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE CITY'S CONTINUED GROWTH AND PROSPERITY. THE TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH EMBRACES THE PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND OFFERS SUCH SAFEGUARDS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGACY OF BRITISH COLONIAL RULE, A LEGACY THAT IS VERY OFTEN CITED TO DISTINGUISH THE LEGAL AND SOCIETAL DEVELOPMENT OF HONG KONG FROM THAT OF ITS NEIGHBOUR ACROSS THE BORDER, MAINLAND CHINA. THIS ARTICLE, DRAWING ON UNEXPLORED ARCHIVAL MATERIALS, CHALLENGES THIS WIDELY ACCEPTED NARRATIVE, THEREBY SEVERING THE LINK BETWEEN COMMON LAW'S LEGAL PAST AND PRESENT IN HONG KONG. THROUGH A CLOSE READING OF A WIDELY REPORTED COURT CASE CONCERNING STUDENTS' ANTI-JAPAN MOVEMENT IN 1919, THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM PRACTISED IN PRE WORLD WAR II HONG KONG PLAYED A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE IN REINFORCING AN AUTHORITARIAN FORM OF COLONIAL LAW AND ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S STRATEGIC AIM OF MAINTAINING ITS OVERSEAS TERRITORIAL AND ECONOMIC POSSESSIONS THAN IN SAFEGUARDING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.
210	MOST COMPARATIVE WORLD REPORTS ON GOVERNANCE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND RULE OF LAW CONSISTENTLY SUGGEST THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS BEEN AMONG THE TOP 20 COUNTRIES IN CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND RESPECT OF RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME OF THE FACTORS AND ACTORS THAT ACHIEVE THIS RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF ETHICS MONITORING AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION IN THE U.S. PUBLIC SERVICE. FOUR FACTORS ARE PROPOSED TO BE OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE: DEMOCRACY'S PRINCIPLES, PROCEDURES, AND PROCESSES; COMMUNALIZATION AND INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICAL STANDARDS; THE ROLE OF PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT; AND IRRATIONALIZATION OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR.
211	THE APPLICABILITY OF THE IDEAL WE CALL 'THE RULE OF LAW' (ROL) IN INTERNATIONAL LAW (IL) IS COMPLICATED BY (1) THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO OVERARCHING WORLD GOVERNMENT FROM WHOM WE NEED PROTECTION (OF THE SORT THAT THE ROL TRADITIONALLY OFFERS) AND IT IS ALSO COMPLICATED BY (2) THE FACT THAT IL AFFECTS STATES, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALS (FOR WHOSE SAKE WE USUALLY INSIST ON ROL REQUIREMENTS). THE ARTICLE USES BOTH THESE IDEAS AS POINTS OF ENTRY INTO A CONSIDERATION OF THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ROL IN IL. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE 'TRUE' SUBJECTS OF IL ARE REALLY HUMAN INDIVIDUALS (BILLIONS OF THEM) AND IT QUERIES WHETHER THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY NEED ARE REALLY BEST SECURED BY GIVING NATIONAL SOVEREIGNS THE BENEFIT OF ROL REQUIREMENTS IN IL. FOR EXAMPLE, A NATIONAL SOVEREIGN'S INSISTENCE THAT IL NORMS SHOULD NOT BE ENFORCED UNLESS THEY ARE CLEAR AND DETERMINATE MAY MEAN THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE FEWER PROTECTIONS AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. MORE RADICALLY, IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO THINK OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNS MORE AS 'OFFICIALS' OR 'AGENCIES' OF THE IL SYSTEM THAN AS ITS SUBJECTS. ON THIS ACCOUNT, WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE ANALOGOUS SITUATION OF OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES IN A MUNICIPAL LEGAL SYSTEM: ARE OFFICIALS AND AGENCIES IN NEED OF, OR ENTITLED TO, THE SAME ROL PROTECTIONS AS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS? IF NOT, THEN MAYBE IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO THINK THAT SOVEREIGN STATES ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME ROL PROTECTIONS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AS INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL.
212	STRONG GOVERNANCE IS VITAL FOR DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES TO PROMOTE RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND DISCOURAGE NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. THE PRESENT RESEARCH EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN PAKISTAN, INDIA, BANGLADESH, AND SRI LANKA USING DATA FROM 1996 TO 2019. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE STUDY USES DIFFERENT ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES TO FIND THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH ON OIL, NATURAL GAS, COAL, HYDROELECTRICITY, AND RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ALL INVESTIGATED RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, REGULATORY QUALITY MEASURES ALSO INCREASE ALL TYPES OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. EXCEPT FOR NATURAL GAS, THE IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NEGATIVE, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS POSITIVELY AFFECTS ALL ENERGY SOURCES. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON NATURAL GAS CONSUMPTION. POLITICAL STABILITY HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES AND A POSITIVE IMPACT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. THE MAGNITUDES OF THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MOST GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE FOUND TO BE LARGER ON NONRENEWABLE SOURCES THAN RENEWABLE SOURCES. THE TESTING OF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND GOVERNANCE NEXUS IS SCANT IN GLOBAL LITERATURE AND IS MISSING IN SOUTH ASIAN LITERATURE. HENCE, THE STUDY RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO HOW SOUTH ASIAN ECONOMIES CAN BE MORE SUSTAINABLE IN ENERGY USE BY ENHANCING GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN THE ECONOMIES. PARTICULARLY, THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION CONTROL, GOVERNANCE, REGULATORY QUALITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH TO HELP MAINTAIN A SUSTAINABLE BALANCE OF RENEWABLE AND NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. MOREOVER, THIS ISSUE NEEDS FURTHER ATTENTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AS GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WOULD PLAY AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE ENERGY.
213	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE ORIGIN OF CHINESE LEGALISM, ITS MAJOR PROPOSITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS. IT COMPARES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINESE LEGALISM AND OTHER CHINESE PHILOSOPHIES INCLUDING CONFUCIANISM, TAOISM AND MOHISM. IT ALSO DISCLOSES THE DIFFERENCE OF CHINESE LEGALISM AND WESTERN LEGALISM IN RELATION WITH MORALITY. WESTERN LEGALISM DEFENDED THE RULE-OF-LAW BUT ARGUED AGAINST THE MORALITY OF LAW. IN CONTRAST, CHINESE LEGALISM, ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY PRE-QIN ERA, DID NOT SEPARATE MORALITY FROM LAW. HOWEVER, THE FIDELITY TO LAW IN CHINESE LEGALISM WAS INTERPRETED AS THE FIDELITY TO THE MONARCH, AND THUS BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE WESTERN RULE-OF-LAW.
214	ANY RULE OF LAW CONTAINS A RULE AND THE LEGAL ENERGY NECESSARY FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE PROCESS OF RULEMAKING, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. THE RULE OF LAW IS MATERIAL. IT IS A SYSTEM THAT CONSISTS OF TWO ELEMENTS. IN THE RULE OF LAW, THE LEGISLATOR FIXES THE RULES OF CONDUCT. ITS IMPLEMENTATION ASSUMES A CERTAIN DYNAMICS THAT ENSURES THE MOVEMENT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. WITHOUT THIS ELEMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY, ITS STAGES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. A RULE OF LAW IS NOT A MONOLITH, BUT A COMPLEX MATERIAL SYSTEM, THE STUDY OF WHICH CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RULEMAKING, CURRENT LEGISLATION AND THE PRACTICE OF ITS APPLICATION. THUS, A RULE OF LAW CONSISTS NOT ONLY OF ONE RULE, BUT ALSO OF THAT PART OF IT THAT PROMPTS THE RULE TO BE REALIZED, I.E. LEGAL ENERGY, WITHOUT WHICH IT (THE NORM) IS DEAD, I.E. IT IS NOT ABLE TO "WORK", ACT. A RULE OF LAW IS AN ACCUMULATOR OF LEGAL ENERGY, WHICH IN ITS SCOPE AND IMPACT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF NORM, ITS BELONGING TO A CERTAIN BRANCH OF LAW AND THE FORM OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION: FINE, REPRIMAND, DETENTION, IMPRISONMENT, ETC. LEGAL ENERGY PROVIDES THE DYNAMICS OF THE RULE OF LAW, ITS IMPLEMENTATION. THE FORMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE APPLICATION, THE USE OF LEGAL ENERGY, ENSURING ITS DYNAMICS. IN SCIENCE, FOUR FORMS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORMS OF LEGAL MATTER ARE DEFINED, THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO TALK ABOUT FOUR FORMS OF MANIFESTATION OF LEGAL ENERGY: COMPLIANCE, EXECUTION, USE, APPLICATION. THIS IS MANIFESTED IN DETAIL IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NORMS OF ANY BRANCH OF RUSSIAN LAW, INCLUDING LABOR LAW. AT PRESENT, IT IS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO INVESTIGATE THE LEGAL ENERGY, NOT ONLY TO EXPLAIN THIS ELEMENT OF THE LEGAL NORM, BUT ALSO TO INVESTIGATE THE DYNAMICS OF ITS USE, FORMULATE A GENERAL APPROACH TO THE MOVEMENT, DYNAMICS OF THE LEGAL NORM, A UNIT OR A SET OF UNITS OF ITS MEASUREMENT, USE.
215	TODAY, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES ARE FAR MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE LAWS ENACTED BY CONGRESS, COVER FAR MORE PAGES IN THE RELEVANT LEGAL CODES, ACCOUNT FOR FAR MORE REGULATORY COMMANDS, AND HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON AMERICAN ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. ALTHOUGH ADMINISTRATIVE RULES CAN PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC BEN FIT, LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE SCOPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORIY AND ON THE PROCESSES BY WHICH IT IS EMPLOYED PROVIDE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS. COURTS, WHEN ASKED, CAN REVIEW THE LEGALITY OF THESE RULES; COURTS ALSO CAN STAY RULES' EFFECTIVENESS PENDING REVIEW, BOTH PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO AND REDUCING COSTS ENTAILED BY RULES OF QUESTIONABLE LEGALITY. HOLDING RULES IN ABEYANCE UNTIL THY CAN BE REVIEWED OFTEN IS THE BEST-AND AT TIMES THE ONLY-VEHICLE FOR GUARANTEEING A MEANINGFUL REVIEW. CANONS OF DEFERENCE TO BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL DISCRETION SHOULD BE REVISITED IN LIGHT OF THE VAST REACH OF FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION, THE CONCENTRATED IMPACT REGULATIONS OFTEN HAVE ON SPEQFIC INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES, AND THE FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT STAYING RULES' EFFECTS IS CRITICAL TO LIMITING ADMINISTRATIVE ADVENTURISM AND AVOIDING IRREPARABLE HARM. GREATER ATTENTION TO THE HARM FROM FAILURE TO STAY QUESTIONABLE RULES CAN PROTECT RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, PRESERVE LIBERTIES THAT WERE CENTRAL TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, AND PROVIDE SPACE FOR SERIOUS EVALUATION OF THE RULES' CONSISTENCY WITH LAW.
216	AFTER LONG NEGLECTING ISSUES OF CITIZEN SECURITY AND JUSTICE, DEMOCRATISATION THEORISTS HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO RECOGNISE THE, IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. YET THEORISING THE CONSTRUCTION OF STATE INSTITUTIONS OF SECURITY AND JUSTICE HAS TENDED TO BE PIECEMEAL AND DIVORCED FROM BROADER THEORETICAL DEBATES. USING THE CASE OF POST-WAR,EL SALVADOR, THIS ARTICLE FIRST ARGUES THAT JUSTICE AND SECURITY ARE TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR THE SURVIVABILITY AND EVERYDAY RELEVANCE OF DEMOCRACY, GIVEN THAT CRIME IS THE CHIEF THREAT TO SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY. SECOND, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES COMPETING VIEWS OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORM. IT FINDS SUPPORT FOR PATH-DEPENDENT 'MODE-OF-TRANSITION' APPROACHES THAT POSTULATE HEIGHTENED AGENCY TO ADOPT NEW RULES AND REFORM INSTITUTIONS DURING UNCERTAIN TRANSITION PERIODS. HOWEVER, MORE SCEPTICAL CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL THEORISTS. ARE RIGHT INSOFAR AS THE FORMAL REMOVAL OF AUTHORITARIAN STRUCTURES AND PERSONNEL IS EASIER THAN THE INFORMAL TRANSFORMATION OF STATE PRACTICES AND OF SOCIETY'S ATTITUDES ABOUT STATE SERVICES. THE ARTICLE ALSO FINDS THAT SECURITY (I.E., MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE AND POLICE) REFORMS OPERATE DIFFERENTLY TO JUDICIAL REFORMS, WHICH WERE MORE DIFFICULT AND WERE LESS TIED TO THE COUNTRY'S PEACE PROCESS. THE INTERACTION OF THESE REFORM PROCESSES WITH A POST-WAR CRIME WAVE HELPS EXPLAIN WHY INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CONSIDER EL SALVADOR'S, REFORMS A SUCCESS STORY, BUT MANY SALVADOREANS DO NOT.
217	STATES INVOLVED IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTES HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS WITH REGARD TO RESOLVING THEIR DISPUTES. WHAT TYPES OF STATES ARE MORE LIKELY TO RESORT TO LEGAL METHODS OF PEACEFUL RESOLUTION IN ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THEIR TERRITORIAL DISPUTES? WE POSIT THAT TWO SEPARATE MECHANISMS AFFECT STATES' DECISIONS TO CHOOSE LEGAL METHODS OF PEACEFUL RESOLUTION: THE LEGAL MECHANISM - DOMESTIC RULE-OF-LAW, AND THE POLITICAL MECHANISM - WIN/LOSS RECORD. RULE-OF-LAW BASED ARGUMENTS CANNOT FULLY EXPLAIN STATES' BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ARBITRATION AND ADJUDICATION. IT IS THE INTERPLAY OF BOTH OF THESE MECHANISMS THAT EXPLAINS THE STRATEGIC CHOICES MADE BY STATES WITH REGARDS TO ARBITRATION AND ADJUDICATION. WE EXPLAIN WHY SOME HIGH RULE-OF-LAW STATES RETURN TO BINDING METHODS, WHILE OTHERS TURN TO DIFFERENT FORUMS, AND WHY LOW RULE-OF-LAW STATES CONSIDER BINDING METHODS. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF ALL ATTEMPTS AT PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF TERRITORIAL DISPUTES FROM 1985 TO 2006 SHOW THAT HIGH RULE-OF-LAW STATES ARE MORE LIKELY TO RETURN TO INTERNATIONAL BINDING VENUES ONLY IF THEY HAVE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THESE METHODS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FIND THAT LOW RULE-OF-LAW STATES ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THEIR RECORD OF SUCCESSES/FAILURES WHEN RESORTING TO INTERNATIONAL BINDING VENUES. OVERALL, THE EFFECT OF REGIME TYPE/RULE-OF-LAW IS CONDITIONED BY PAST SUCCESSES AND FAILURES IN INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTION VENUES.
218	THE PAST 20 YEARS HAVE WITNESSED AN INCREASE IN THE ATTENTION THAT THE INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN POLICY RESPONSES HAVE DEVOTED TO IRREGULAR IMMIGRATION AND TRANSNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME, WITH THE FACILITATORS PACKAGE BEING AMONG THE PROTAGONISTS OF THE CRIMINALISING APPROACH ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN LEGISLATOR. MORE SPECIFICALLY, PROVISION WAS DRAFTED AND RATIFIED WITH THE AIM TO TACKLE IRREGULAR MIGRATION BY STRENGTHENING THE PENAL FRAMEWORK ON THE FACILITATION OF UNAUTHORISED ENTRY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) EXTERNAL BORDERS IN 'THE STRICT SENSE, AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUSTAINING NETWORKS WHICH EXPLOIT HUMAN BEINGS'. NEVERTHELESS, ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN ACHIEVING THE STATED GOALS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE EU REGULATORY FITNESS PERFORMANCE PROGRAMME (REFIT) ASSESSMENT BY THE EU COMMISSION RELEASED IN 2017, THE ACADEMIC JUDGMENT HAS TAKEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION, LABELLING THE PROVISION AS EXEMPLARY OF THE PREVENTIVE ROLE TAKEN BY EU CRIMINAL LAW. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE THE TRANSPOSITION OF THE FACILITATORS PACKAGE BY THE ITALIAN LEGISLATORS AND TO EXAMINE ITS APPLICATION WITHIN THE NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK, IN ORDER TO SCRUTINISE THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THE SYMBOLIC APPLICATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW PROVISION IS HAVING ON THE ITALIAN JURISDICTION IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW (PARTICULARLY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY).
219	THE ARTICLE CONCERNS THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF COURTS CONTROLLING THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ON THE DIRECTION OF ITS ACTIVITIES AND THE CONTENT OF ISSUED DECISIONS. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONCERNS SOVEREIGN INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS THAT AFFECT THE SPHERE OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO SEEK AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER INDEPENDENT JUDGES ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF MANAGEMENT IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, WHICH IS CHARACTERISED BY ELEMENTS OF POLITICS AND (REGARDLESS OF THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION) WHETHER SUCH PARTICIPATION IS ALLOWED OR (EVEN) NECESSARY IN MODERN RULE OF LAW STATES. THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE COURTS CONTROLLING THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE REFORMATORY OR EXCLUSIVE CASSATION POWERS, THEY INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. AT THE SAME TIME, SUCH INFLUENCE NOT ONLY DOES NOT VIOLATE THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IS EVEN SOMETIMES NECESSARY. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT COURTS SHOULD INTERFERE IN THE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE IN EVERY CASE.
220	MUCH SCHOLARSHIP IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY LITERATURE HAS INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC ADVANTAGE ON SOVEREIGN BOND RATINGS BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES (CRAS). MISSING FROM EARLIER WORK, HOWEVER, IS INQUIRY INTO THE EFFECTS ON BOND RATINGS OF FACTORS THAT LOWER POLITICAL RISK, SUCH AS ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRESENCE OF A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM, AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. USING PANEL DATA FOR UP TO THIRTY-SIX DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2006, WE FIND THAT RULE OF LAW, STRONG AND INDEPENDENT COURTS, AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BOND RATINGS. POLICYMAKERS WANTING TO OBTAIN HIGHER BOND RATINGS AND INCREASED REVENUE FROM BOND SALES WOULD DO WELL TO HEED THE MESSAGE CONTAINED IN THESE FINDINGS.
221	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND RULE OF LAW IN POLAND HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY UNDER CHALLENGE BEFORE NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN COURTS. DEPARTING FROM A CASE STUDY OF JUDGE ZUREK, AN EMBLEMATIC FIGURE OF THE POLISH JUDICIAL COMMUNITY PROSECUTED FOR CRITICIZING THE POST-2015 JUDICIAL REFORMS, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES HOW THE EUROPEAN HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK CAN PLAY OUT IN A PARTICULAR CASE OF A JUDGE DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW IN HIS COUNTRY. AFTER HAVING OUTLINED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS PROSECUTION, IT FOLLOWS HIS JOURNEY TO LUXEMBOURG AND STRASBOURG. NAMELY, IT LAYS OUT THE LEGAL ISSUES BEFORE THE COURTS AND EXAMINES THE STANDARDS THEY ESTABLISH, COMMENTING ON HOW THEY TRANSLATE INTO PROSPECTS OF REDRESS. IT FINDS THAT, WHILE BOTH THE CJEU AND THE ECTHR ESTABLISH STANDARDS ON COURT TRANSFERS, JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, PREMATURE TERMINATION OF OFFICE OR THE LINK TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, THE LEVEL OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE REQUIRED FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION CREATES A PARADOX.
222	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE STUDY OF RIOS ROSAS' WORK. HE WAS ONE THE KEY FIGURES DURING THE PROCESS OF THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY SPANISH PARLIAMENTARIANISM AND ALSO PLAYED A PRIOR ROLE IN A PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH WAS CONSOLIDATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF THE SPANISH POLITICAL LIFE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGITIMACY, OBEDIENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, DEFENSE OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND MODERNISATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION.
223	POLAND'S CONFLICT WITH THE EU OVER THE POLISH GOVERNMENT'S JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE NORMS OF RULE OF LAW HAS INTENSIFIED. POLAND IS UNWILLING TO RECOGNIZE A RULING FROM THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE THAT DECLARED THE DISCIPLINARY CHAMBER, THE CENTRE-PIECE OF THE POLISH REFORM, ILLEGAL. WARSAW REFUSES TO PAY THE FINES IMPOSED. IN OCTOBER 2021, POLAND'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED THAT THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW CONTRADICTED THE POLISH CONSTITUTION. THE SHRILL WORD "POLEXIT" MADE THE ROUNDS. THE POLISH GOVERNMENT HAS OPTED FOR CONFRONTATION WITH THE EU. THERE ARE DOMESTIC POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS, AS SUPPORT FOR THE RULING LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY IS IN DECLINE. BUT RADICALIZATION AND CONFRONTATION WILL LEAD TO A DEAD END.
224	THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE PANDEMIC CAUSED BY COVID-19 CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MANY GLOBAL RISKS FACED BY OUR SOCIETIES, ONE OF THOSE RISKS THAT HAVE ARRIVED TO STAY. THAT, THEREFORE, DEMANDS A RESPONSE OUT OF A STATE OF EXCEPTIONALITY. THE PAPER ALSO WARNS OF THE RISKS AND INSECURITY FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS POSED BY THE DELAY IN THE TIME OF EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES, AND ADVOCATES REGULATION BY ORGANIC LAW OF HEALTH EMERGENCY SITUATIONS-THE CURRENT ONE OR THOSE THAT WE MAY EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE-. THE QUESTION OF HOW WE ASSESS THE RISKS AND WHAT RESPONSES WE REGULATE IN ADVANCE TO FACE THEM CONSTITUTES TODAY AN IMPER-ATIVE FOR THE DEFENSE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
225	IF THERE IS ANY AREA OF GOVERNMENT IN WHICH ONE WOULD EXPECT TO LOCATE THE RULE OF LAW, IT WOULD BE IN THE COURTS. AND, IF THERE IS ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE DESERVING THE PROTECTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT WOULD BE THE ACCUSED UNABLE TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE SIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A RIGHT TO ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL, AND BOTH SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND FEDERAL STATUTE EXTEND THAT RIGHT TO INDIGENT DEFENDANTS IN CRIMINAL CASES WHILE ESTABLISHING THAT THE REPRESENTATION PROVIDED IS AT LEAST MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE. HOWEVER, WHILE THESE RIGHTS EXIST ON PAPER, THEIR PROTECTION HAS GONE WANTING IN PRACTICE AS THE COMPETING GOALS OF FEDERAL JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE STARVED INDIGENT DEFENSE OF SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND HAVE FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THE ATTORNEYS AND REPRESENTATION PROVIDED ARE ADEQUATE. INDEED, AS FEDERAL JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS BECOME MORE 'PROFESSIONALLY' FOCUSED - DEFERRING TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERTISE OF STAFF MEMBERS AND EMPHASIZING COST-EFFECTIVE, RESULTS-ORIENTED MANAGEMENT - INDIGENT CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS HAVE SEEN THE ADEQUACY OF THEIR REPRESENTATION FALL, IN TURN THREATENING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER TELLS THAT STORY BY SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPLAINING THE GROWTH OF JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN THE UNITED STATES AND SHOWING HOW THE FEDERAL COURTS' INCREASED FOCUS ON BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES AND STAFF EXPERTISE IN COST CONTAINMENT HAVE ENDANGERED THE MOST VULNERABLE PARTIES IN THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASES. AS SUCH, THE FEDERAL COURTS' OVER-RELIANCE ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEORY AND THEIR FAILURE TO BALANCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION WITH OTHER CENTRAL GOALS THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR VERY COURTROOMS. THERE IS A WAY OUT OF THIS MORASS, WHICH A COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL COURTS HAS EVEN RECOMMENDED: INDEPENDENCE OF THE DEFENSE FUNCTION FROM THE COURTS' ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES. BARRING THAT CHANGE, A CENTRAL CONSTITUTIONALLY-PROTECTED RIGHT WILL REMAIN AT RISK.
226	GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PRESSING CONCERN, PARTICULARLY IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. BECAUSE GREENHOUSE GASES ARE A KEY CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS TIED TO EMISSIONS. THE STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE HOW THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), TERTIARY EDUCATION, AND RULE OF LAW COULD BE UTILIZED MORE EFFECTIVELY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE STUDY USED DATA FROM 30 LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) AND 10 HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES (HICS), AS GROUPED BY THE WORLD BANK, FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2000 AND 2014. IN THIS STUDY, SUM OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION IS THE RESPONSE VARIABLE AND GDP VALUE, GROSS ENROLLMENT IN TERTIARY EDUCATION, RULE OF LAW INDEX ARE THE KEY EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. INDEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TEST AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS WERE APPLIED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE STUDY FOUND A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF GDP ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS [0.722, (0.653, 0.790), P < 0.01] FOR LMICS AND [-0.605, (-0.728, -0.482), P < 0.01] FOR HICS. FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION, THE REGRESSION MODEL COEFFICIENT IS [-0.187, (-0.274, -0.100), P < 0.01], AND [0.480, (0.356, 0.603), P < 0.01], RESPECTIVELY FOR THE LMICS AND HICS. AND THE RULE OF LAW INDEX [-0.046, (-0.112, 0.020), P = 0.170], AND [0.099, (-0.028, -0.227), P = 0.125] FOR LMICS AND HICS RESPECTIVELY CAME OUT AS STATISTICALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT ALTHOUGH FROM THE MEAN TEST, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAN OF THE VARIABLE RULE OF LAW OF LMCS AND HICS IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT [P < 0.01] THUS, IT HAS SOME IMPACT ON THE EFFICIENT USE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT IN THE LMICS, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE HIGHLY POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH GDP AND THE NEGATIVE COEFFICIENT FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION INDICATES IT HOLDS DOWN THE EMISSIONS. FOR THE HICS, IT IS EVIDENT THAT GDP IS NOT A MAJOR DRIVER AND POSITIVE SIGNIFICANCE FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION INDICATES THAT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS MAY RESULT FROM EXTRAVAGANT OPERATIONS THAT MIGHT BE LINKED WITH HIGHER TERTIARY EDUCATION, WHICH REQUIRES FURTHER ANALYSIS.
227	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DEPOSITION OF THE OTTOMAN GOVERNOR OF EGYPT BY CAIRO'S SOLDIERS IN 1676, AND A SUBSEQUENT COURT CASE, IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN OTTOMAN POLITICS DURING THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY. I SHOW THAT IN THE COURT CASE, THE SOLDIERS SOUGHT TO CONSTRAIN THE ACTIONS OF FUTURE OTTOMAN GOVERNORS BY ESTABLISHING LEGAL LIMITS ON THEIR AUTHORITY. I ARGUE THAT THE SOLDIERS DISPLAYED A CONSTITUTIONAL SENSIBILITY: A BELIEF THAT THE CONDUCT OF GOVERNMENT WAS BOUND BY RULES, AND THAT COURTS WERE THE PLACE TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE THESE RULES. THIS ALLOWS US TO SEE THE FREQUENT REBELLIONS IN THE SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN A NEW LIGHT: AS PART OF AN EMERGING CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT WAS CENTRAL TO THE EMPIRE'S TRANSFORMATION FROM A PATRIMONIAL MONARCHY INTO AN EARLY MODERN BUREAUCRATIC STATE.
228	SOCIAL ORDER, TO REMAIN STABLE, NEEDS THE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. SUCH CONSENT REQUIRES NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION. THE RATIONAL FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DEMOCRATIC STATE RESTS ON THE PRESUMPTION OF THE EQUALITY OF EVERY CITIZEN. MALE DOMINATION OF FEMALES NEVERTHELESS REMAINS UNIVERSAL EVEN IN THE MOST ADVANCED DEMOCRATIC NATION STATES BECAUSE IT IS LEGITIMIZED BY THE SHARED ASSUMPTION THAT PATRIARCHY REFLECTS THE WILL OF GOD OR IS DICTATED BY NATURE. FREUD'S DIAGNOSIS OF PATRIARCHY AS A COLLECTIVE NEUROSIS OF THE GROUP MIND NEGATES EVERY POSSIBLE NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION THAT CAN BE MADE FOR GENDER HIERARCHY. FREUD MADE EXTENSIVE REFERENCES TO MYTH IN DEVELOPING HIS ANALYSIS OF THE NEUROTIC FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL ORDER. AN ANALYSIS OF THE STRUCTURE OF MYTH SUGGESTS THAT IDEOLOGICAL SEDUCTION RATHER THAN GOD, NATURE OR BIOLOGY DETERMINES MALE DOMINANCE. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
229	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLORE PORTUGAL'S PERFORMANCE IN SOME AREAS THAT CAN BE INCLUDED IN A WIDE CONCEPT OF EUROPEANIZATION: THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND EDUCATION. IT STARTS WITH A BRIEF REFERENCE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY SINCE THE EUROPEAN ACCESSION TO CONCLUDE THAT WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE SINGLE CURRENCY PORTUGAL ENTERED INTO A PHASE OF CLEAR ECONOMIC DIVERGENCE, MAKING IT AN EXCEPTION WITHIN THE EU. SECTION 2 IS DEVOTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW A MODERN AND UPDATED LEGAL SYSTEM CAN HAVE AN OUTCOME THAT THREATENS SOME BASIC FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING SOCIAL INEQUALITY. THE LAST SECTION FOCUSES ON SOME PROBLEMS AFFECTING EDUCATION. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SECONDARY EDUCATION SYSTEM AND TO ISSUES RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS.
230	THIS ARTICLE INFORMALLY EXPLORES SELECTED ACADEMIC LAW LIBRARY RESEARCH GUIDES GENERALLY AND MORE SPECIFICALLY DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION GUIDES TO SHOW HOW THESE GUIDES SUPPORT DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
231	FROM AN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL THEORY PERSPECTIVE, THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF ASCRIBING HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS, IN THE FORM OF INTERNATIONAL OR EXTRATERRITORIAL LAW, ONTO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS (TNCS). THE MAJOR POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS IN FAVOUR OF EXTENDING HUMAN RIGHTS DUTIES TO INCLUDE TNCS BECOME DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF ADVOCATES' CLAIMS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS RULES, RATHER THAN A SOVEREIGN'S LEGAL RULES, ARE NECESSARILY THE RULES THAT ARE TRULY AUTHORITATIVE AND/OR IN LINE WITH A 'GLOBAL RULE OF LAW'. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES CONCEPTS SUCH AS AUTHORITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND JUXTAPOSES THESE CONCEPTS: FIRSTLY, WITH ONE ANOTHER; SECONDLY, WITH THE LEGAL STATUS QUO ABOUT JURISDICTION OVER COMPANIES; AND THIRDLY, WITH CORPORATIONS' DE FACTO TRANSNATIONALITY IN THE CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES KEY SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COMPANIES, STATES, AND INDIVIDUALS, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE RELEVANCE OF THESE DISTINCTIONS TO THOSE AGENTS' POTENTIAL HUMAN RIGHTS DUTIES. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT THE 'TNC AND HUMAN RIGHTS' PROJECT IS WELL WORTH PURSUING, BUT ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS THAN THOSE CURRENTLY ENDORSED BY LEGAL AND POLICY ANALYSTS, AND IT SUGGESTS IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
232	THIS STUDY SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE HOW ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND THE RULE OF LAW AFFECT THE ONSET OF ETHNIC WAR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHILE SEVERAL EMPIRICAL STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED THE ROLES OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE RULE OF LAW ON LARGE-SCALE CIVIL WAR, MOST ETHNIC WARS DO NOT REACH THE INTENSITY OF CIVIL WAR. AS A CONSEQUENCE, WE HAVE A WEAK UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GLOBALIZATION AND RULE OF LAW AFFECT THE RISK OF ETHNIC WAR. THIS STUDY LINKS THE LITERATURES ON ETHNIC WAR, GLOBALIZATION, AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND EXAMINES THE CONCOMITANT EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND RULE OF LAW ON LOW-INTENSITY ETHNIC WAR ONSETS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT BOTH CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF ETHNIC WAR BECAUSE EACH CONSTRAINS STATE POWER AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ENHANCES OPPORTUNITIES FOR ETHNIC INCLUSION. ANALYSES OF 140 COUNTRIES FROM 1997 TO 2010 SHOW THAT BOTH ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE RISK OF LOW-INTENSITY ETHNIC WAR, AND THE DISCRIMINATION OF ETHNIC POPULATIONS INCREASES THIS RISK. TO FACILITATE PEACE AT LOCAL LEVELS, INTERNATIONAL POLICY MAKERS AND STATES SHOULD PROMOTE GLOBAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND ETHNIC INCLUSION.
233	IN THIS PIECE, THE TEXT OF A PUBLIC LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG BY LORD NEUBERGER, A NON-PERMANENT JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL, THE SPEAKER IDENTIFIES THE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THEN FOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE REQUIREMENT FOR GENUINE ENFORCEABILITY, IN PARTICULAR, THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ACHIEVING GENUINE ENFORCEABILITY.
234	CATEGORIES REFLECT PARTICULAR THEORIES ABOUT THE WORLD IN THE FORM OF CAUSAL AND PERFORMATIVE CLAIMS. UNLIKE ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE THE MAINSTAY OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, THESE DISCRETE ENTITIES CONSIST OF THE CONTRADICTION OF BEING EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND YET HARD TO ANALYZE. AN IMPORTANT OBSTACLE TO THE EXPLORATION OF CAUSAL CLAIMS ABOUT CATEGORIES (E.G. NATIONS) IS THE LIMITED DIVERSITY OF OBSERVED CASES. WE PROPOSE THE USE OF METHODOLOGIES THAT TAKE GREATER EXPLORATORY ACCOUNT OF CAUSAL COMPLEXITY AND THAT RESPECTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CASE NARRATIVES FOR THE EXPLICIT DECISIONS MADE TO ARRIVE AT THEORETICAL CLAIMS. ONE SUCH METHODOLOGY IS QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS DEVELOPED BY CHARLES RAGIN. THIS METHOD IS APPLIED TO DATA PROVIDED BY TWO INDEPENDENT LINES OF STUDY (I.E. RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNANCE AND VARIETIES OF CAPITALISM) TO SHOW HOW THE IDENTIFICATION, AND ADOPTION, OF PROTOTYPES IS COMPLEX. THROUGH THE USE OF LOGIC (E.G. DE MORGAN'S LAW) AND REDUCTIVE INFERENCES, WE EXPLORE THE SPACE OF OBSERVED AND UNOBSERVED CONFIGURATIONS, SHOWING HOW THE IDENTIFICATION OF INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATIONS RELIES UPON LOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE RARELY MADE EXPLICIT. THE ANALYSIS REJECTS THE HYPOTHESIS OF RULE OF LAW AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND QUALIFIES THE INSTITUTIONAL PROTOTYPES OF CORPORATISM AND MARKET AS USEFUL DESCRIPTIONS OF THE VARIETIES OF CAPITALISM.

235	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE POTENTIAL TRADE SPILLOVERS OF CHINESE POLICIES TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND DISCUSSES HOW NATIONS MIGHT WORK COLLABORATIVELY AT THE WTO TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. CHINESE LEADERS ARE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND HAVE LONG IGNORED CHINESE EMPLOYMENT LAWS (AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL LAW) THAT COULD EMPOWER WORKERS. CHINESE LEADERS HAVE NOT MADE SUFFICIENT EFFORT TO EITHER EDUCATE WORKERS AND MANAGERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE LAW (DEMAND SIDE OF THE LAW) OR TO EDUCATE POLICYMAKERS THROUGHOUT CHINA AS TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LAW (SUPPLY SIDE). THE FAILURE TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS HAS DISTORTED TRADE. NORMS REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW UNDERPIN THE GATT/WTO BUT THEY ARE IMPLICIT. CHINA BECAME THE FIRST (BUT NOT ONLY) NATION TO HAVE EXPLICIT RULE OF LAW OBLIGATIONS. CHINA WAS "REQUIRED TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW THROUGHOUT ALL OF ITS TERRITORIES." I SUGGEST A WAY IN WHICH WTO MEMBERS CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO CHINA TO IMPROVE ITS RULE OF LAW.
236	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AND THE RULE OF LAW, SHOWING THAT ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION PROPERLY CONCEIVED IS NOT ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH A PARTICULAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW BUT COULD ALSO BECOME A VEHICLE ALLOWING THE EXECUTIVE TO EXPRESS ITS COMMITMENT TO THAT PRINCIPLE. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, THIS IS POSSIBLE IF, FIRST, DISCRETION IS CONCEIVED THROUGH THE METAPHOR OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN RULERS AND RULED; AND, SECOND, WE ENDORSE A SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT VIEWS ALL THREE CONSTITUENTS OF THE STATE - LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL, AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES - AS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT OF PREVENTING ARBITRARY ACTION BY PUBLIC POWERS. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THESE DYNAMICS IN THE CONCRETE SETTING OF THE AUTHOR'S EXPERIENCE AS ASSOCIATE DEAN OF A LAW SCHOOL, IN ORDER BOTH TO SEE HOW THE THEORETICAL MODEL OF DIALOGUE TRANSLATES INTO PRACTICE AND TO IDENTIFY THE PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF THE THEORY THAT MIGHT REQUIRE FURTHER INQUIRY AND EMPIRICAL RESEARCH.
237	AUTHORS HAVE ARGUED THAT COUNTERTERRORISM MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH 'THE RULE OF LAW.' OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS APPROACH IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT PLURAL POLITICAL STRUCTURES LIMIT THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO TERRORISM AND THAT STATE AGENTS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEIR RESPONSE IS EXCESSIVE. SCHOLARS WHO FOCUS ON SOCIAL MOVEMENTS REJECT THIS ASSUMPTION. WE EXAMINE THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO ANTI-STATE VIOLENCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND BETWEEN 1969 AND 1994. IN 1982, SINN FEIN DID MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN AN ELECTION TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND ASSEMBLY. FOLLOWING THE ELECTION, IT IS ALLEGED THAT STATE AGENTS FOLLOWED A 'SHOOT-TO-KILL' POLICY AND SHOT DEAD IRISH REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES INSTEAD OF ARRESTING THEM. WE FIND EVIDENCE SUGGESTING SUCH A POLICY AND CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS.
238	RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN THE METEORIC RISE OF THE CONCEPT OF AN 'INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL COURT' IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS: FOR EXAMPLE, DUBAI ESTABLISHED THE DUBAI INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CENTRE COURTS IN 2004, QATAR FOLLOWED SUIT IN 2009 AND SIMILAR COURTS HAVE BEEN SET UP SINCE IN SINGAPORE, KAZAKHSTAN, CHINA, GERMANY, FRANCE AND THE NETHERLANDS. MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE DISCUSSING THE PRACTICALITIES OF SUCH COURTS BUT LITTLE THOUGHT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR, AND THEORETICAL PROBLEMS POSED BY, SUCH COURTS. IN GENERAL, SUCH COURTS ARE JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF PARTY AUTONOMY; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT PARTY AUTONOMY IS THE ONLY, OR EVEN THE MAIN, CONSIDERATION IN INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. STATES ALSO HAVE A CLEAR INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT DISPUTES ARE DECIDED IN THEIR JURISDICTION TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT AND VIABILITY OF THEIR OWN LEGAL SYSTEM. OTHER THEORETICAL ISSUES WHICH ARISE REGARDING SUCH COURTS INCLUDE WHETHER JUSTICE IS A COMMODITY WHICH CAN BE BOUGHT AND SOLD AND THE POTENTIAL USE OF SUCH COURTS TO 'WHITEWASH' THE SERIOUS RULE OF LAW CONCERNS THAT EXIST IN THE ORDINARY COURTS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.
239	THE GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN MOST IN ASSERTING INDEPENDENT EXECUTIVE COMPETENCE PURSUANT TO THE PRESIDENT'S JOINT ROLES AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES AND AS HEAD OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. ONE OF ITS LEGACIES IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS AN UNSETTLED MATTER, BOTH INTELLECTUALLY AND PRACTICALLY. WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE UNDER EMERGENCY CONDITIONS MAY BE REQUIRED, IT IS UNLIKELY TO OCCUR. ANALYSIS SHOULD CONSIDER HOW TO IMPROVE THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF MICROSTRUCTURES WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS OPTIONS FOR INSTITUTING DESIGN CHANGES BUT CONCLUDES THAT NO SUCH OPTION IS COMPELLING, GIVEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOOD LAWYERING ABOUT CONTENTIOUS ISSUES WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IT RECOMMENDS SYSTEMATIC DELIBERATION ABOUT "BEST PRACTICES" IN EXECUTIVE BRANCH LAWYERING-WITH THE AMBITION OF ARTICULATING A PRACTICAL THEORY ON THE DUE PROCESSES OF GOVERNANCE THAT ENCOMPASSES THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
240	LEGAL AND ECONOMIC SCHOLARSHIP GENERALLY ASSUMES THAT PEOPLE WEIGH COSTS AND BENEFITS IN RESPONDING TO LEGAL RULES. THIS SAME SCHOLARSHIP OFTEN ASSUMES, HOWEVER, THAT TRIAL JUDGES APPLYING THE LAW DO NOT COMPARE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THEIR OWN EFFORT WHEN IMPLEMENTING LEGAL RULES. CONSIDERATION OF TRIAL COURT EFFORT RESULTS IN THE SO-CALLED ENFORCER'S DILEMMA, A SIMILAR PROBLEM THAT INFECTS THE DECISION OF PLAINTIFFS TO BRING SUIT. SUPPOSE THE TRIAL COURT DEVOTES LOTS OF ITS OWN EFFORT IN EVERY CASE FULLY TO MINIMIZE ERRORS; IT NEVER TRIAGES THE CASES, DISMISSING ON THE PLEADINGS OR ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT. KNOWING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NEGLIGENCE IS APT TO RESULT IN LIABILITY, RELATIVELY FEW WILL VIOLATE THE LEGAL RULE IF THEY COULD AVOID DOING SO AT A REASONABLE COST. THE POOL OF DEFENDANTS CAUSING ACCIDENTS WILL THEN CONSIST MAINLY OF THOSE WHO WERE NONNEGLIGENT. UNDERSTANDING AS MUCH, THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD NOT WASTE ITS OWN EFFORT OR JUDICIAL TIME CONFIRMING WHAT IT KNOWS TO BE TRUE. INSTEAD, THE TRIAL COURT HAS AN INCENTIVE TO DEVIATE, TO DISMISS THE CASES AFTER A CURSORY INVESTIGATION, CONTRADICTING OUR INITIAL ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE TRIAL COURT'S BEHAVIOR. GIVEN THIS PROFITABLE DEVIATION, GAME THEORISTS SAY THAT LOOKING CLOSELY AT EVERY CASE THAT COMES IN THE COURTHOUSE DOOR CANNOT BE AN EQUILIBRIUM. INSTEAD, WITH TRIAL COURTS OPERATING UNDER BUDGET CONSTRAINTS WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ONLY EQUILIBRIUM INVOLVES TREATING LIKE CASES DIFFERENTLY. GIVEN THE SAME FACTS, SOMETIMES THE COURT LOOKS CLOSELY AT THE MERITS, MEANING THEY LET THE CASE PROCEED BEYOND DISMISSAL OR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. OTHER TIMES THEY DO NOT YET THIS TRIAL COURT STRATEGY IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER POINTING OUT THIS PERSUASIVE FEATURE OF EX POST ADJUDICATION, THE CONCLUSION TURNS TO APPELLATE REVIEW AS A POSSIBLE FIX. IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS "FIX" SUFFERS THE SAME PROBLEM.
241	THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN THE COURSE OF RECENT YEARS PUBLISHED A SET OF RELEVANT DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EU. THESE TARGETED INITIATIVES ARE FOCUSED ON EU MEMBER STATES, WHILE THEY ALMOST COMPLETELY FAIL TO ADDRESS THE NEGOTIATIONS WITHIN THE ACCESSION PROCESS OF THE ASPIRING MEMBER STATES. BEARING THIS IN MIND, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CHALLENGE THE APPROACH TAKEN BY SOME AUTHORS WHO CLAIM THAT THE EUROPEAN CONDITIONALITY CAN UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW AND LEAD TO REGULATORY FRAGMENTATION AND FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE. TO THAT END, THE PAPER OFFERS A HYBRID MODEL, WHICH THE AUTHORS WANT TO USE TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE INTERNAL PROCESS OF STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN EU MEMBER STATES, AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THE ONGOING RULE OF LAW RELATED NEGOTIATION PROCESS IN THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA. THE OFFERED THEORETICAL MODEL COMBINES ELEMENTS OF THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONALITY, THE SOCIAL LEARNING AND LESSON-DRAWING MODELS. FINALLY, THE PAPER PROVIDES CERTAIN PROPOSALS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE FRAMEWORK FOR JUDICIAL REFORM IN ASPIRING MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
242	WE USE WORLDWIDE FIRM-LEVEL DATA TO STUDY HOW WOMEN-LED FIRMS DIFFER FROM MALE-LED FIRMS IN PRODUCTIVITY, AND INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE DIFFERENCES. WOMEN-LED FIRMS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN COUNTRIES WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW, GENDER EQUALITY, AND STRONGER INDIVIDUALISTIC CULTURE, AND IN SMALL FIRMS AND SERVICES INDUSTRIES. RELATIVE TO MEN-LED FIRMS, WOMEN-LED ONES HAVE LOWER LEVELS AND GROWTH OF LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, BUT SIMILAR LEVELS OF TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY. THE DISADVANTAGE IS MAINLY IN MANUFACTURING FIRMS, NONEXISTENT IN SERVICE FIRMS, AND ONLY IN SMALL FIRMS. FURTHERMORE, THE DISADVANTAGE IN PERFORMANCE FOR WOMEN-LED FIRMS IS SMALLER FOR COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER GENDER EQUALITY AND LOWER BURDENS OF HOUSEHOLD CHORES AND DOMESTIC CARE FOR WOMEN. FINALLY, IT IS SMALLER WHERE THERE IS LESS EMPHASIS ON PERSONAL NETWORKS, LESS COMPETITION FROM INFORMAL FIRMS, AND THE CULTURE IS MORE COLLECTIVE. THE STUDY DOES NOT FIND THAT THE FEMALE LEADER DISADVANTAGE IS AMPLIFIED IN CORRUPT ENVIRONMENTS. (C) 2022 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.
243	IN RECENT YEARS, WIDESPREAD CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROPOSED REFORMS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN POLAND POSING A RISK TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE COUNTRY. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSED REFORMS ALSO THREATENS THE MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES, WHICH IS THE BACKBONE OF JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN CIVIL MATTERS. IT WILL SHOW HOW MUTUAL TRUST UNDERPINS THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION OF JUDGMENTS UNDER VARIOUS EU REGULATIONS AND DISCUSSES TO WHAT EXTENT THESE REGIMES ALLOW FOR EXCEPTIONS TO MUTUAL RECOGNITION IN CASE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS CONCERNS IN THE MEMBER STATE OF ORIGIN OF A JUDGMENT. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) MAINTAINS A STRICT APPROACH TO SUCH CASES, ALLOWING FOR EXCEPTIONS ONLY IN EXTREME CASES. THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) IS SHOWN TO BE DEFERENTIAL TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE CJEU IN THIS REGARD.
244	THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018 IS THE CORNERSTONE OF UK LEGISLATION DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH THE LEGAL DIMENSION OF BREXIT. IT BRINGS THE ENTIRE ACQUIS OF EU LAW INTO UK LAW IN ORDER TO AVOID REGULATORY BLACK HOLES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR. THE ACT EMBODIES A TWOFOLD LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY: EU LAW BROUGHT INTO UK LAW THEREBY IS TO BE MADE FIT FOR PURPOSE BY EXIT DAY, WITH NECESSARY CHANGES BEING MADE BY STATUTORY INSTRUMENT; PARLIAMENT CAN THEN DECIDE AT GREATER LEISURE THEREAFTER WHETHER IT WISHES TO RETAIN, AMEND OR REPEAL THIS LEGISLATION. THE BURDEN PLACED ON PARLIAMENT IS UNPRECEDENTED, ALL THE MORE SO GIVEN THE EXIGENCIES OF TIME IN WHICH THE CHANGES ARE TO BE MADE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLICATES THE PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS OF THE 2018 ACT, AND THE CONCERNS AS TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE AND THE RULE OF LAW RAISED BY THE LEGISLATION. THE TENSIONS IN THE DRAFTING PROCESS ARE MADE APPARENT, AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE RESULTING TEXT ARE REVEALED.
245	IN THIS PAPER, WE ADDRESS THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, PRESENTING SOME USEFUL PERSPECTIVES FOR ITS ANALYSIS AND EDIFICATION, AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE SET THE ELEMENTS THAT, AFTER ITS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT, CONFIGURE ITS ESSENTIAL BASIC CONTENT. THIS CONTENT SHOWS THAT, FOR THERE TO BE AN AUTHENTIC RULE OF LAW, THE POWER MUST BE LIMITED AND SUBJECT TO LAW, THERE MUST BE A SEPARATION AND BALANCE OF ITS FUNCTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS, AN EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL CONTROL IN ITS EXERCISE, IN ADDITION TO THE RECOGNITION AND EFFECTIVE OR ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. WITH THIS OBSERVATION, WE ALSO APPROACH SOME THEORETICAL MODELS THAT, FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS, RAISE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, AND WE CONCLUDE WITH AN APPROXIMATION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE AS AN ADVANCED EXPRESSION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
246	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LINK BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN A EUROPEAN CONTEXT, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR). IT IS ARGUED THAT THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) ON THE SUBJECT IS BEST UNDERSTOOD BY REFERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE CONVENTION TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IS LESS CONTROVERSIAL THAN CRITICS ASSERT. MOREOVER, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, ON THE NORMATIVE LEVEL, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS SHARE A COMMON BASE. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES, HOWEVER, THAT THE USE OF HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS IS UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS.
247	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT MEMBER STATES COMPLY WITH EU OBLIGATIONS IN TERMS OF PROCESS AND OUTCOME. THE AIM IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW NORM-CONFORM BEHAVIOUR UNFOLDS, OR FAILS TO UNFOLD, IN AN INTERACTION BETWEEN A MEMBER STATE AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. THE EMPIRICAL FOCUS IS ON RECENT RULE OF LAW CRISES IN FRANCE, HUNGARY AND ROMANIA. THE ARGUMENT IS THAT MEMBER STATES ENGAGE IN SYMBOLIC AND/OR CREATIVE COMPLIANCE, DESIGNED TO CREATE THE APPEARANCE OF NORM-CONFORM BEHAVIOUR WITHOUT GIVING UP THEIR ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES. THE CASES ILLUSTRATE THAT CREATIVE AND SYMBOLIC COMPLIANCE STRATEGIES MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED BY MEMBER STATES BECAUSE THEY ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO DISENGAGE FROM CONFLICTS IT JUDGES TOO COSTLY AND YET MAINTAIN ITS CREDIBILITY, AND ARE CONDITIONED BY THE VISIBILITY OF FAILURE TO CHANGE FACTS ON THE GROUND. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT, AT TIMES, NOT ONLY IS COMPLIANCE SYMBOLIC, BUT ALSO TO SOME EXTENT IS ENFORCEMENT.
248	THE LITERATURE ON EUROPEAN UNION (EU)-TURKEY RELATIONS HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON EXPLAINING THE GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (AKP)'S POST-2005 EUROPEANIZATION RATHER THAN ANALYSING THE MORE PUZZLING QUESTION OF WHY SOME REFORMS PERSISTED AS OPPOSED TO OTHERS DESPITE THE FALLING CREDIBILITY OF EU MEMBERSHIP IN THE SAME PERIOD. TO FILL THIS GAP, THE PAPER STUDIES THE AKP'S DIFFERENTIAL 'EUROPEANIZATION' CONCERNING CIVILIANIZATION, RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. WHILE REFORMS TARGETING CIVILIANIZATION PERSISTED OVER THE YEARS, DEMOCRATIC PROGRESS IN THE OTHER TWO AREAS RATHER STALLED AFTER 2007. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS VARIATION IS INDUCED BY AKP'S CHANGING DOMESTIC POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT NEEDS. SPECIFICALLY, AKP USED THE EU REFORM PROCESS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICAL SURVIVAL FOLLOWED BY POWER CONSOLIDATION AFTER 2007.
249	DATA PROTECTION IS GENERALLY SURMISED AS ANTITHETICAL TO STATE SURVEILLANCE AND REGULATORY INTRUSIVENESS INTO THE MEASURES THAT BUSINESSES ADOPT TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA. THIS ORIGINATES IN AN ANCIENT, WEST-ROOTED UNDERSTANDING OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' AS THE ULTIMATE SHIELD OF 'THE PRIVATE' SPHERE AGAINST 'THE PUBLIC' SOVEREIGN POWER. THEREFORE, THROUGH WESTERN LENSES, DATA PROTECTION AND STATE SECURITIZATION OF CITIZENS' DATA CANNOT BE BUT A DICHOTOMY. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES SUCH A PRESUMPTION, ARGUING THAT A NO LESS LEGITIMATE VIEW OF WHAT THE 'RULE OF LAW' STANDS FOR GIVES RISE TO BOTH A VERTICAL AND A HORIZONTAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS PRIVACY REGULATION. BY SCRUTINIZING THE CATHAY PACIFIC DATA BREACH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR PASSENGERS' RECORDS IN TERMS OF CORPORATE LIABILITY, THIS ANALYSIS POSITS THAT CHINA AND ONE OF ITS SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS, HONG KONG, DISPLAY THE FACETS OF A HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL POLICY APPROACH TO DATA PROTECTION RESPECTIVELY. COMPARATIVE OBSERVATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT AGAINST A CONTEXT OF INCREASINGLY PERVASIVE CYBERATTACKS, A FAIR DEGREE OF STATE OVERSIGHT IN CORPORATE CYBERSPACE REGULATION IS NOT NECESSARILY TO BE REJECTED. IN FACT, STATE 'INTERVENTIONISM' TO PREVENT CYBERATTACKS SEEMS A LEGITIMATE OUTLOOK ON DATA PROTECTION, WHICH, WHILE POSSIBLY IMPAIRING CITIZENS' PRIVACY VERTICALLY VIS-A-VIS THE GOVERNMENT, GREATLY ENHANCES SUCH A PRIVACY HORIZONTALLY BY CONSTRAINING EXPOSURE TO DATA MISAPPROPRIATION BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL (HOME AND FOREIGN) CYBERCRIMINALS. THESE TWO 'CHINESE' APPROACHES CAN BE SYNTHESIZED AND MIGHT, INDEED, COALESCE INTO AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, TO BE BASED ON MODERATE STATE ASSERTIVENESS TO PREVENT DATA BREACHES IN THE CYBERSPACE.
250	AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE USSR, RUSSIA AND OTHER FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS ADOPTED DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS TO SIGNAL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THEY BECAME DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS, DESPITE ALMOST TWO DECADES OF THE ALLEGED DEMOCRATIZATION, MANY POST-SOVIET STATES STILL DISPLAY AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES OF POLITICAL JUSTICE, WHOSE DOUBLE STANDARDS RESEMBLE MORE THE COMMUNIST 'SOCIALIST LEGALITY' RATHER THAN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE SOVIET LEGACY OF `TWOFOLD CONSTITUTIONALISM', WHICH MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE POLITICIZED TRIALS AGAINST CITIZENS OF UKRAINE IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHORTLY AFTER THE ILLEGAL ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA IN 2014 AND DURING THE ONGOING MILITANT INSURGENCY SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF RUSSIA IN EASTERN UKRAINE. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT RUSSIA AND MANY OTHER POST-SOVIET STATES INHERITED FROM THE USSR AN UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION OF EXTRALEGAL TRADITIONS AND PRACTICES THAT NOWADAYS CAN TRUMP ANY LEGAL PROVISION AND DETER THE TRANSITION FROM THE COMMUNIST REGIME TO THE RULE OF LAW.
251	THE EUROPEAN TRAVEL INFORMATION AND AUTHORISATION SYSTEM (ETIAS) WILL PROFILE VISA EXEMPT THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS USING A SCREENING RULES ALGORITHM TO MAKE AUTOMATED PREDICTIVE RISK ASSESSMENTS. BY USING THE SCREENING RULES ALGORITHM AS A CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES IF THE ETIAS REGULATION, AND THE LEGAL SAFEGUARDS IT ESTABLISHES FOR THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, COMPLY WITH FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE LEGALITY REQUIREMENTS AS DEFINED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THREE LEGALITY CHALLENGES ARE IDENTIFIED: [1] THE REGULATORY DESIGN OF ETIAS RAISES ISSUES IN RELATION TO THE FORESEEABILITY, CLARITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF LAW, AS WELL AS INSUFFICIENT LIMITS TO DISCRETION. [2] THE ETIAS SCREENING RULES ALGORITHM REPRESENTS A DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS A NEW FORM OF ARBITRARINESS THROUGH 'ALGORITHMIC DISCRETION'. [3] THE SAFEGUARD OF MANUAL (HUMAN) PROCESSING IN CASE OF A 'HIT' IS NOT A PANACEA FOR THE IDENTIFIED LEGALITY CHALLENGES.
252	THOMAS AQUINAS'S NOTION ON LAW, TYRANNY AND RESISTANCE SERVED AS A LIMITATION ON GOVERNMENTAL POWERS. WHEN THOSE WHO BEAR THE LAW COMMAND THINGS WHICH EXCEED THE COMPETENCE OF SUCH AUTHORITY, THE SUBJECT IS FREE TO OBEY OR DISOBEY. THE FUNCTION OF THE LAW CULMINATES IN TWO MAXIMS: QUANTUM AD VIM COACTIVAM LEGIS AND QUANTUM AD VIM DIRECTIVAM. WITH REGARD TO THE FORMER, THE PRINCE IS ABOVE THE LAW (LEGIBUS SOLUTUS). IT IMPLIES THE PRINCIPLE OF SALUS REIPUBLICAE SUPREMA LEX, WHICH MEANS THAT THE SAFETY OF THE STATE IS THE SUPREME LAW. ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE PROPERTY, LIBERTY AND LIFE (BASIC INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS) ARE SUBORDINATE TO OR EVEN SACRIFICED FOR THE SUPPOSED PUBLIC GOOD. WITH REGARD TO THE LATTER, THE PRINCE'S POWER SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE LAW. THE VIS DIRECTIVE LIMITS THE AUTHORITY OF THE PRINCE. THIS PRINCIPLE IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NOTION IS CONCOMITANT WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ENTRENCHED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH AFRICA, ACT 108 OF 1996. THE IDEA OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ALSO BOLSTERED BY THE ENTRENCHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO PROTECT BASIC INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. HEREAFTER THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE PRINCE OR STATE TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. IT ALSO MEANS THAT THE PRINCE OR BRANCHES OF STATE MUST OBEY THE LAW. IF THE PRINCE OR STATE ACTS WITHOUT LEGAL AUTHORITY, IT IS ACTING LAWLESSLY, WHICH IS AGAINST THE NOTION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
253	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE INCREASINGLY PREVALENT IDEA THAT SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, WE HAVE MOVED INTO A STATE OF PERMANENT EMERGENCY AND AN ABANDONMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS THIS IDEA, SHOWING THAT HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY HAVE ACTUALLY PLACED EMERGENCY POWERS AT THE HEART OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A MEANS OF ADMINISTERING CAPITALIST MODERNITY. THIS SUGGESTS WE NEED TO RETHINK OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF EMERGENCY MEASURES IN THE "WAR ON TERROR" AND, MORE GENERALLY, TO RECONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND VIOLENCE.
254	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EXCLUSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN DISPUTE SETTLEMENT FROM TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG. OTHER THAN A POWER-BASED PROVISION TO RESOLVE ANY PROBLEMS THROUGH CONSULTATION, THE CLOSER ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENT (CEPA) BETWEEN THE CENTRAL PEOPLES GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY RULES OR PROCEDURES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES. THE POLITICIZATION OF DISPUTE SETTLEMENT FAVOURS THE FREEDOM OF INFORMALITY BUT COMPROMISES CERTAINTY OF IMPLEMENTATION, EFFICIENCY OF CONSISTENCY, AND TRANSPARENCY OF JUSTICE, ALL NECESSARY FOR FURTHER AND FAIRER TRADE CREATION AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. THIS ARTICLE, THEREFORE, CALLS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN TRADE RELATIONS BETWEEN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG WITH A PROPOSAL FOR A QUASI-ADJUDICATIVE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM FOR CEPA THAT COMPLEMENTS THE POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION WITH AN ADJUDICATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ARBITRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.
255	THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW ORIGINATE FROM THE THEORY OF NATURAL LAW, WHICH WAS THE POPULAR BELIEF DUE TO THE CHRISTIANITY DOCTRINE. THERE WAS LESS NATURAL LAW TRADITION IN CHINESE HISTORY, IN SPITE OF THE EXISTENCE OF POSITIVIST JURISPRUDENCE AND HISTORICAL JURISPRUDENCE WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO THE WESTERN TRADITION. IN ORDER TO BUILD CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW IN THE PRESENT ERA, CHINA NEEDS THE SUPPORT OF THE DOCTRINE OF NATURAL LAW. THE STRUCTURING OF THE CHINESE NATURAL LAW THEORY WHICH COMPRISES BOTH CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE AND CHINESE LEGAL THOUGHT, IS A HOLY MISSION FOR CHINESE CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS.
256	THIS TEXT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT UP ABOUT THE SECULARITY OF THE STATE. SUCH MISUNDERSTANDINGS GENERATE AN UNJUSTIFIED STIGMA IN RELATION TO THE CONFESSIONALISM OF THE STATE AND LEAD TO THE WRONG PERCEPTION THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE GUARANTEE OF A DEVELOPED SOCIETY NECESSARILY PRESUPPOSES A RUPTURE WITH THE CHURCH.
257	ACHEBE'S TWO NOVELS OF COLONIZATION, THINGS FALL APART AND ARROW OF GOD, ONE WRITTEN JUST BEFORE AND ONE JUST AFTER INDEPENDENCE, BOTH BEGIN WITH THE THREAT OF WAR BETWEEN VILLAGE GROUPS. IN THE FIRST, WAR IS AVERTED BY THE GROUPS THEMSELVES, NEGOTIATING COMPENSATION ON THE BASIS OF RECIPROCITY. IN THE SECOND, WAR IS NOT AVOIDED AND LEADS DIRECTLY TO INTERVENTION BY THE BRITISH, WHO ASSERT A MONOPOLY ON VIOLENCE AND JUSTIFY IT ON THE BASIS OF THE DESIRABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT THEY IMPOSE. I READ ACHEBE'S NOVELS NOT AS HISTORICAL NARRATIVES BUT AS PARABLES OF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. RECIPROCITY (THE BASIS OF VENGEANCE BUT ALSO OF A GIFT ECONOMY) IS OPPOSED TO THE LAW (IMPOSED BY A SOVEREIGN AND LEGITIMIZED BY ITS DISINTERESTED ARBITRATION). THE INTEREST THAT ACHEBE EXPRESSED IN MODELS LIKE RECIPROCITY, WHICH DO WITHOUT THE STATE, DISAPPEARED AFTER INDEPENDENCE, WHEN NIGERIANS HAD THEIR OWN STATE. NEVERTHELESS, BOTH NOVELS EXPRESS A DEEP AMBIVALENCE ABOUT THE LAW AND THE VIOLENCE REQUIRED TO IMPOSE IT.
258	THE QUEST FOR LEGITIMACY OF POLITICAL DECISIONS IS THE MAIN SUBJECT OF POLITICAL ETHICS, AND THE ANSWER TO IT IS USUALLY SEEN IN A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE DEMOCRATIC DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND THE RULE OF LAW. YET, IN CRISIS SITUATIONS, FOR INSTANCE CAUSED BY TERRORIST THREATS, THIS FRAMEWORK IS PUT TO THE TEST: IS IT POSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY EXCEPTIONS FROM THE RULE OF LAW? THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DISCUSS VARIOUS FORMS OF EXCEPTIONS AND TO LEARN FROM THE COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES IMMANUEL KANT, CARL SCHMITT, AND GIORGIO AGAMBEN HOW TO DEFINE EXCEPTIONS IN LAW AND ETHICS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM. BASED ON THESE INTERPRETATIONS AND ILLUSTRATED BY A VARIETY OF EXAMPLES POLITICAL ETHICS CAN PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF SOUND POLITICAL JUDGEMENT, AND BY THUS AVOIDING NEGATIVE PROCESSES OF "FRAMING" OR "AUTO-IMMUNITY".
259	OUR CONSTITUTION PLACES AUTHORITY OVER IMMIGRATION LAW IN THE HANDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT IT ENTRUSTS THE RULE OF LAW'S FATE PRIMARILY TO THE CARE OF THE STATES. TODAY, SO-CALLED SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS ARE SEEKING TO THWART NOT ONLY THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT THE BEDROCK PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS, NOT OF MEN. IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL BRIEFLY EXAMINE THE NATURE AND HISTORY OF THE SANCTUARY JURISDICTION MOVEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS. I WILL THEN EXPLAIN HOW TEXAS TOOK A LEADERSHIP ROLE BY PASSING SENATE BILL 4 BOLD LEGISLATION TO END THE LAWLESSNESS OF SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS. FINALLY, I WILL DETAIL HOW TEXAS ACTED PROPERLY AND WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WHY THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO INVALIDATE THE STATUTE FAIL AS A MATTER OF LAW.
260	CORRUPTION WAS ALWAYS INTRINSIC TO ALL TYPES OF ECONOMY, BUT THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAD THE SMALLEST LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND THIS RULE WORKED OPPOSITE. BUT RECENTLY, THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM HAS INCREASED AND CHANGED SHARPLY AROUND THE WORLD. THIS NEGATIVE PHENOMENON IN A LONG RUN IS ABSORBING ALMOST ALL EXECUTIVE BRANCHES. SO, THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO ANALYZING THE MAIN SPHERES AND AREAS OF CORRUPTION. RESULTS SHOWED THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE HIGH RATES IN A CORRUPTED SOCIETY. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE REASONS AND ROOTS OF CORRUPTION BEHAVIOR. REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOR THE RULE OF LAW INDEX AND CORRUPTION INDICATORS IS CARRIED OUT WITH A FOCUS ON THE RELATION BETWEEN ROL INDEX AND CPI, GCI. THE DIRECT LINK BETWEEN ROL INDEX AND CPI IS CONFIRMED EMPIRICALLY (R-2 = 0,9155). ALSO, AN INDIRECT LINK BETWEEN ROL INDEX AND GCI (R-2 = 0,9294), ROL INDEX AND ESG INDEX IS CONFIRMED (R-2 = 0,7209). THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS WAS GIVEN TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT THE INTEGRATED ANTI-CORRUPTION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE TANGENT SPHERES: PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, JUSTICE, EDUCATION AND MEDICINE, ET. MAJOR APPROACHES THAT DEFINE THE RULE OF LAW WERE CLARIFIED WITH THE AIM TO PROVE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NON-COMPLIANCE OF RULE OF LAW AND THE APPEARANCE OF CORRUPTION AS A PHENOMENON. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME PRINCIPLE THAT DEFINES THE FREEDOM TO LIVE WORTHILY WITHOUT CORRUPTED ACTIONS THAT DESTROY PEOPLE'S INDEPENDENCE FIRSTLY FROM THE SHADOW ECONOMY AND SECONDLY FROM DISHONEST BEHAVIOR FROM DIFFERENT DEPENDENT OFFICIALS.
261	THIS ARTICLE DISMANTLES THE MYTH THAT THE EU'S FAILURE TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE RISE OF AUTOCRATIC MEMBER GOVERNMENTS HAS BEEN DUE TO ITS LACK OF ADEQUATE TOOLS. THE EU HAS USED THIS EXCUSE REPEATEDLY TO JUSTIFY ENGAGING IN WHAT LAURENT PECH CALLS A NEW INSTRUMENT CREATION CYCLE - REACTING TO ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW NOT BY DEPLOYING EXISTING TOOLS BUT BY WASTING TIME CREATING NEW ONES. THE REPETITION OF THIS CYCLE HAS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF A RULE OF LAW RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINE - A REDUNDANT ASSEMBLAGE OF MOSTLY USELESS INSTRUMENTS OSTENSIBLY DESIGNED TO HELP THE EU ADDRESS BACKSLIDING. THE POINTLESSNESS OF MANY OF THESE TOOLS IS UNDERSCORED WHEN WE LOOK CLOSELY AT THE FEW SIMPLE BUT POTENTIALLY POWERFUL, MACGYVER-LIKE TOOLS THAT THE EU HAS HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL ALL ALONG, BUT WHICH EU LEADERS HAVE FAILED TO USE ROBUSTLY TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY.
262	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXTENSION OF COMPETENCE TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) IN THE AREA OF IMMIGRATION POLICY. THROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ITALY, FRANCE AND THE NETHERLANDS OF CJEU DECISIONS ON EXPULSION AND FAMILY REUNIFICATION IT IS SHOWN THAT AN EU RULE OF LAW HAS DEVELOPED THAT CAN CONSTRAIN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS. THIS MEANS THAT THE EU CAN NO LONGER BE CONCEPTUALIZED IN THE AREA OF IMMIGRATION POLICY AS MERELY AN EXTERNAL VENUE TO WHICH MEMBER STATES ESCAPE' IN ORDER TO CIRCUMVENT LEGAL CONSTRAINTS AT NATIONAL LEVEL. THE GROWING ROLE OF THE CJEU FORCES INSTEAD A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF IMMIGRATION LAW AND POLICY IN EUROPE.
263	I ARGUE THAT SCHMITT WAS A FAUX JURIST AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND 'SCHMITTEAN' LOGIC. THIS IS A LOGIC WHICH AIMS TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW WHICH IS NOT UNIQUE TO SCHMITT AND IS AT PLAY IN OUR CONTEMPORARY WORLD.
264	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE CHINESE LEGAL-JUDICIAL REFORM THAT WAS UNFOLDING IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY (1901-37): I.E., WHY AND HOW CERTAIN TYPES OF VIOLENT CRIMES WERE CATEGORIZED AND PUNISHED OUTSIDE THE CRIMINAL CODE AND THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LAW THAT WERE ADOPTED AS THE LAW OF THE LAND AND APPLIED IN COURT. IT WILL REVEAL A CONTINUOUS TENSION BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND DUE PROCESS THAT GUIDED THE LEGAL-JUDICIAL REFORM AND WERE INSISTED ON BY JUDICIAL OFFICIALS AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DESIRE OF PROVINCIAL AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS TO RESORT TO "QUICK JUSTICE" TO PUNISH AND DETER VIOLENT CRIMES. AN ANALYSIS OF THAT TENSION WILL HELP TO ILLUMINATE NOT ONLY CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUT ALSO AN IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF PROVINCIAL AND COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PRACTICES IN EARLY-TWENTIETH-CENTURY CHINA.
265	THE CONCEPT OF PROTECTION OF DISTRESSED CITIZENS ABROAD WAS BORN INSIDE THE MAINSTREAM OF THEORIES ON 'LAW OF NATIONS' IN THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN CENTURIES. FOR A LONG TIME, THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN BASED ON THE STRICT RELATION BETWEEN STATE AND 'ITS' SUBJECTS. SINCE 1992, THE NEW LEGAL ORDER OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU) LAW HAS GIVEN ZEST TO THE NOVEL CONCEPT OF PROTECTION OF EUROPEAN CITIZENS ABROAD, SO THAT ANY EU COUNTRY CAN INTERVENE TO PROTECT UNREPRESENTED EUROPEANS IN THIRD COUNTRIES. RULE OF LAW AND MEMBER STATE ACCOUNTABILITY ARE TWO BASIC MILESTONES IN EU LAW AND WELL-SETTLED CASE LAW OF THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE, SO THAT THE TRADITIONAL THEORIES ON STATE IMMUNITY AND ON DISCRETIONARY POWER OF CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC AGENTS CANNOT REASONABLY BE MAINTAINED. THE PRESENT STUDY WILL CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS ON ARTICLE 23 OF THE TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (TFEU), WHERE THE BASIC PROVISION ON PROTECTION OF EUROPEANS ABROAD IS ENSHRINED.
266	TAKING ITS CUE FROM A REMARKABLE INSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVE OWING TO THE GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER, THIS ESSAY CONTESTS SOME OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE INFORMED LIBERALISM'S COSMOPOLITAN TURN. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARGUMENT ADDRESSES THE WAY IN WHICH LIBERAL LEGAL THOUGHT HAS HANDLED A DOCTRINE WIDELY KNOWN AS "THE RULE OF LAW". THE TEXT CHALLENGES THE UNIVERSALIZING DRIVE HAVING INFORMED THE DISSEMINATION OF "THE RULE OF LAW" AND THE ATTENDANT MARGINALIZATION OF CULTURE IN THE FORM OF THE DECREDIBILIZATION OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE. THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT "COMPARATIVE LAW" CAN OFFER A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LIBERAL SELF TO REVISIT ITS UNIFORMIZING IDEOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS - ALTHOUGH NOT "COMPARATIVE LAW" OF THE MAINSTREAM BRAND.
267	WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DIVING INTO A WIDER STUDY ON THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL ACTORS IN THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE PRESENT WORK PRESENTS A METHODOLOGICAL PROPOSAL TO EMPIRICALLY EXPLORE THE WAY IN WHICH NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS INFLUENCE THE DISSEMINATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AMONG JUDICIAL ACTORS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. IT ALSO PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR, IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN. THIS LAST ISSUE IN THE HOPE THAT LARGER INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES WILL MAKE THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS MORE FEASIBLE, WHICH WOULD ALSO POSITIVELY AFFECT THE STATE OF RULE OF LAW AND THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY.
268	SCHOLARS HAVE FOUNDED GOVERNMENT LIABILITY ON VARIOUS SOURCES. THERE ARE STRONG OPINIONS IN FAVOUR OF GROUNDING GOVERNMENT LIABILITY ON THE "RULE OF LAW" OR RECHTSTAAT. NEVERTHELESS, WHEN THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES VACUOUS OR CONTRARY TO THE NORMATIVE REALITY OR THE CURRENT CASELAW, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO RESORT TO ANOTHER FOUNDATION. THIS OTHER FOUNDATION, AS FAR AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, CAN PROVIDE A MORE FIRM AND PERMANENT GROUNDING TO JUSTIFY GOVERNMENT LIABILITY. SUCH IS THE CASE OF JUSTICE.
269	GLOBALIZATION CAN UNDERMINE AS WELL AS ENABLE PUBLIC DISCOURSE AT THE NATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL, AND SUPRANATIONAL LEVELS. A CHALLENGE FOR POLITICAL THEORY IS TO IMAGINE HOW A GLOBAL PUBLIC REALM MIGHT BE CONSTITUTED. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC REALM HAS FLOURISHED IN STATES WHOSE CITIZENS ARE RELATED UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, ONE MIGHT ASK WHETHER THIS MODEL OF CIVIL ASSOCIATION CAN BE EXTENDED TO A BROADER AND POTENTIALLY UNIVERSAL CONTEXT. GIVEN THE CONTINGENT OBSTACLES TO A GLOBAL STATE, REALIZING CIVIL ASSOCIATION GLOBALLY IMPLIES A UNIVERSAL CONFEDERATION OF RULE-OF-LAW STATES. IF THE PUBLIC REALM MEANS FREE DELIBERATION ON THE LAWS OF A CIVIL ASSOCIATION, THE 'GLOBAL PUBLIC REALM' WOULD INCLUDE DELIBERATION AT ALL THREE LEVELS.
270	CORRUPTION AND SHADOW ECONOMY ARE TWO CRITICAL PROBLEMS WHICH FEED EACH OTHER AND POSE AN OBSTACLE AGAINST THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH WEAK FUNDAMENTALS. CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION AFTER THE DOWNFALL OF THE BERLIN WALL. THIS STUDY RESEARCHES THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW ON SHADOW ECONOMY IN 11 TRANSITION ECONOMIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE OVER THE 2003-2015 TERM WITH PANEL COINTEGRATION AND CAUSALITY TESTS CONSIDERING HETEROGENEITY AND CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCE. THE COINTEGRATION COEFFICIENTS REVEALED A COMPLEMENTARY INTERPLAY BETWEEN SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY AND CORRUPTION. FURTHERMORE, THE CAUSALITY ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A BILATERAL CAUSALITY BETWEEN CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND SHADOW ECONOMY IN ALL THE CROSS-SECTION UNITS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A TWO-WAY CAUSALITY BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND SHADOW ECONOMY ONLY IN BULGARIA, CZECH REPUBLIC, POLAND AND ROMANIA. FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS ONE-WAY CAUSALITY FROM RULE OF LAW TO SHADOW ECONOMY IN CROATIA, ESTONIA, HUNGARY, SLOVAKIA AND SLOVENIA.
271	THE POST-COLD WAR RULE OF LAW AGENDA IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO REFORMS THAT ENHANCE GENDER EQUALITY. THE FOCUS OF REFORM EFFORTS HAS REFLECTED A POST-COLD WAR EMPHASIS ON CREATING A SUITABLE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE MARKET. IN THIS CLIMATE ANY GAINS FOR GENDER EQUALITY HAVE BEEN LIMITED AND HARD WON. THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS ARE: GAINS IN CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS HAVE HAD LIMITED PRACTICAL REACH; OFFICIAL DISCUSSION OF GENDER INEQUALITY IN PROPERTY REMAINS DISCONNECTED FROM RELEVANT BROADER PROCESSES SUCH AS RESTRUCTURING OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; THE REFORM AGENDA HAS NOT ENGAGED WITH INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, YET THESE HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GENDER RELATIONS; THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVE UNDER-INVESTMENT IN NON-COMMERCIAL JUDICIAL REFORM; AND CHANGES TO LABOUR REGULATION HAVE BEEN EFFECTED THROUGH SUB-LEGISLATIVE AND NON-TRANSPARENT PROCESSES AND HAVE NOT BEEN INTERROGATED FOR THEIR FAILURE TO BENEFIT WORKERS IN GENERAL, AND IN SECTORS DOMINATED BY WOMEN IN PARTICULAR.
272	HLA HART AND JOSEPH RAZ ARE USUALLY INTERPRETED AS BEING FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED TO LON FULLER'S ARGUMENT IN THE MORALITY OF LAW THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE OF MORAL VALUE. HART AND RAZ ARE THOUGHT TO MAKE THE 'INSTRUMENTAL OBJECTION', WHICH SAYS THAT THESE PRINCIPLES ARE OF NO MORAL VALUE BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY PRINCIPLES DERIVED FROM REFLECTION ON HOW TO BEST ALLOW THE LAW TO GUIDE BEHAVIOUR. RECENTLY, MANY THEORISTS HAVE COME TO FULLER'S DEFENCE AGAINST HART AND RAZ, REFUTING THE 'INSTRUMENTAL OBJECTION' AND AFFIRMING THE NON-INSTRUMENTAL MORAL VALUE OF CONFORMITY TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ALTHOUGH THIS MORAL VALUE SHOULD BE AFFIRMED, THE ORTHODOX VIEW IS INCORRECT, BECAUSE HART AND RAZ NEVER UNDERSTOOD THEIR ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTAL OR 'PURPOSIVE' VALUE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AS DENIALS OF THEIR MORAL VALUE, AS A CLOSE READING OF THEIR WORK SHOWS.
273	PRESIDENT VICENTE FOX INTRODUCED A SERIES OF MEASURES AGAINST PRODUCTION AND SALE OF MATERIAL CONTRAVENING COPYRIGHT LAWS, THE SO-CALLED "WAR AGAINST PIRACY." THIS PROGRAM STEMS FROM THE LEGAL STRUCTURES PROMOTED BY GLOBAL NEO-LIBERALISM AND MAKES POLICE ACTION TARGET POPULAR MARKETS AND STREET TRADING. FOX THUS OPENED A NEW CYCLE OF CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND INFORMAL DEALERS IN MEXICO. THIS PROCESS IS VISIBLE IN SAN JUAN DE DIOS MARKET IN GUADALAJARA, WHERE PIRATE PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED. THE FIRST-HAND EVIDENCE COLLECTED IN THIS MARKET LEADS TO AN ANALYSIS OF PIRACY RAIDS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEXICO OF THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION.
274	ASSAULTS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF NATIONAL COURTS IN SOME MEMBER STATES POSE A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND MAY IMPAIR THE ENFORCEMENT AND UNIFORM APPLICATION OF EU LAW. IN ORDER TO COUNTERACT THIS THREAT, THE EU SHOULD CONSIDER SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THOSE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS. IT IS SUBMITTED HERE THAT INVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATION, DESPITE ITS FLAWS, COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS RESPECT, DUE TO ITS INHERENT FEATURES MAKING IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESILIENT TO ATTACKS FROM ILLIBERAL OR AUTOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS THAN NATIONAL COURTS. THIS ARTICLE IS ALSO CRITICAL OF THE ECJ'S RECENT ACHMEA JUDGMENT. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPT OF REDUNDANCY, AS USED IN ENGINEERING TO DESCRIBE DUPLICATION OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS OR . FUNCTIONS OF A SYSTEM WITH THE INTENTION OF INCREASING RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE, OFFERS A BETTER RESPONSE TO CURRENT THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW THAN STRENGTHENING OF THE JUDICIAL MONOPOLY OF THE ECJ AND NATIONAL COURTS UNDER ARTICLE 19 TEU.
275	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE EFFECT THAT CONFORMITY TO THE RULE OF LAW HAS ON THE ENDS WHICH MIGHT LEGITIMATELY BE PURSUED WITHIN A LEGAL SYSTEM. THE NEAT DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE CHALLENGED: EVEN APPARENTLY FORMAL CONCEPTIONS NECESSARILY AFFECT THE CONTENT OF LAW AND NECESSARILY ENTAIL THE PROTECTION OF CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. WHAT REMAINS OF THE FORMAL/SUBSTANTIVE DICHOTOMY IS, IN FACT, A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH GUARANTEE THE SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE OF EACH AND EVERY LAW AND THOSE WHICH ENTAIL SOME COMMITMENT TO BASIC REQUIREMENTS OF JUSTICE WHILE NEVERTHELESS LEAVING ROOM FOR UNJUST LAWS. ULTIMATELY, THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMPETING THEORIES OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCERNS THE NATURE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LEGALITY AND JUSTICE, NOT WHETHER THERE IS ANY SUCH CONNECTION AT ALL.
276	THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS A POLITICAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE. IT RESTS ON THE EXPECTATION THAT GOVERNMENTS WILL ABIDE BY THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SO DEFINES WHAT COUNTS AS APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR FOR STATES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS AN EMPIRE OF GLOBAL LEGALISM THAN AS AN ANARCHIC WORLD OF SOVEREIGN STATES. LEGAL JUSTIFICATION IS THE LINGUA FRANCA OF LEGITIMATION CONTESTS AMONG GOVERNMENTS, AS STATES STRIVE TO SHOW THAT THEIR PREFERRED POLICIES ARE LAWFUL AND THAT THOSE THEY OPPOSE ARE UNLAWFUL. SEEING THE WORLD THIS WAY HELPS TO SHOW THE POLITICAL CONTENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW: NEITHER A NEUTRAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUSTAINS ALL VIEWPOINTS NOR AN INHERENTLY PROGRESSIVE CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL ORDER, INTERNATIONAL LAW IS A POLITICAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE THAT ADVANCES SOME INTERESTS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS, AND OUR ATTENTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARD ASSESSING WHICH INTERESTS ARE SERVED BY THE TURN TO GLOBAL LEGALISM AND AT WHOSE EXPENSE.
277	THERE IS A LEGEND COUNTING THAT HUMBOLDT WOULD BE A KANTIAN. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGEND IS TO ENLIST KANT ON THE SIDE OF THE LIBERALISM AND TO INCREASE THE CONFUSION BETWEEN LIBERALISM AND REPUBLICANISM. THE PRESENT STUDY OBJECTS TO THESE IDEOLOGICAL STRATEGIES. IT SHOWS THAT HUMBOLT IS MUCH MORE CLOSE TO EDMUND BURKE AND TO THOSE WHO TRIED TO THWART THE REPUBLICAN REFOUNDATION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY BY OPPOSING TO IT A CONCEPTION OF THE STATE WHICH RESTS CERTAINLY ON THE RULE OF LAW BUT WHICH IS PRIMARILY LIBERAL AND AIMS ONLY AT A MINIMAL REGULATION OF THE STRUGGLE OF ALL AGAINST ALL. THIS FRONTLINE REMAINS A TOPICAL ISSUE.
278	ALTHOUGH RULE OF LAW IS OFTEN REGARDED AS A SOLUTION FOR RELIGIOUS CONFLICT, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE ROLE OF LEGAL PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS IN HARDENING BOUNDARIES AND SHARPENING ANTAGONISMS AMONG RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES. USING CASE STUDIES FROM SRI LANKA, INDIA, MALAYSIA, AND PAKISTAN, WE HIGHLIGHT FOUR SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH LEGAL PROCEDURES, STRUCTURES, AND INSTRUMENTS CAN FURTHER POLARIZE ALREADY EXISTING RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS. THESE MECHANISMS INCLUDE THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS AND CHOREOGRAPHY OF LITIGATION (SRI LANKA), THE STRATEGIC USE OF LEGAL LANGUAGE AND COURT JUDGMENTS BY POLITICAL AND SOCIORELIGIOUS GROUPS (INDIA), THE ACTIVITIES OF PARTISAN ACTIVISTS WHO MOBILIZE AROUND LITIGATION (MALAYSIA), AND THE EXPLOITATION OF PUBLIC ORDER LAWS IN CONTEXTS FRAMED BY ANTAGONISM TARGETING RELIGIOUS MINORITIES (PAKISTAN).
279	THIS ARTICLE APPRAISES EFFECTIVENESS IN OPERATIONAL CONFLICT PREVENTION. BY FOCUSING ON THE EUROPEAN UNION RULE OF LAW MISSION (EULEX) IN KOSOVO, IT ASSESSES THE MOST EXTENSIVE CIVILIAN COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY MISSION SO FAR. CONTRARY TO PREVAILING ASSESSMENTS, IT POSITS THAT EULEX, DESPITE ITS CHALLENGES AND DEFICIENCIES, PRESENTS POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OPERATIONAL CONFLICT PREVENTION, AND PEACE-BUILDING IN GENERAL. THIS IS UNCOVERED THROUGH STRUCTURED FOCUSED ANALYSIS ACCORDING TO EFFECTIVENESS CRITERIA AND SUCCESS INDICATORS THAT ALLOW FOR IDENTIFICATION OF AND DISTINCTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES AND LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS, CONSIDERING BOTH MEANS APPLIED AND ENDS ACHIEVED. IN SO DOING, THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE GENERAL LITERATURE ON OPERATIONAL CONFLICT PREVENTION AND ON THE SPECIFIC CASE OF KOSOVO. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS BASED ON FIELDWORK AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH EU PERSONNEL, GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS IN KOSOVO, AND INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS.
280	THE CURRENT ROMANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, ESTABLISHED IN 1991, HAS UNDERGONE NUMEROUS FORMAL AND INFORMAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST 25 YEARS. THE MAIN ISSUES THAT AROSE IN THE DECADE SINCE THE COUNTRY'S ADHESION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION WERE THE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW GUARANTEE IN ROMANIA. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO PRESENT A CRITICAL OVERVIEW OF THE ACTUAL ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN THE ROMANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, IN THE DIFFERENT CONTEXTS THAT LINK THE COURT WITH 'OTHERS', IE MAINLY WITH STATE POWERS (THE COURT ITSELF BEING AND INDEPENDENT ORGAN, PLACED OUTSIDE THE JUDICIAL POWER).
281	THIS PAPER EXAMINES REGIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE IN RUSSIA AS A MICROCOSM OF THE STRUGGLE FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH OF STATE POWER TO ASSERT ITS IMPORTANCE, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO SEPARATION OF POWERS. WE CONSIDER THE SITUATION OF REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND REGIONAL CHARTER COURTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN SOME PLACES TO OVERSEE COMPLIANCE WITH THE REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTION OR REGIONAL CHARTER. WE NOTE THAT THE LIMITED NUMBER OF THESE COURTS CONTRASTS STRONGLY WITH THE WIDESPREAD INSTITUTION OF THE REGIONAL OMBUDSMAN (PLENIPOTENTIARY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS). WE ALSO SEE THAT IN RECENT YEARS COURTS IN SOME REGIONS HAVE ENCOUNTERED A PUSHBACK FROM THE OTHER BRANCHES OF STATE POWER. THE STRENGTH OF THE RESULTING DEFENCE OF THE COURTS' LEGAL STATUS GIVES US SOME CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND RULE OF LAW ARE BEING STRONGLY SUPPORTED IN SOME REGIONS.
282	THE FORUM TO WHICH INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES ARE REFERRED FOR ADJUDICATION IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. THIS IS BECAUSE IT BRINGS INTO PLAY FACTORS SUCH AS WHO ADJUDICATES THE DISPUTE, WHICH LAW THE FORUM SHOULD APPLY, THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE OUTCOME OF THE FORUM, AND THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO A LOSING PARTY IN ORDER TO CHALLENGE THE OUTCOME. THERE ARE TWO MAIN FORUMS TO WHICH INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES ARE REFERRED, NAMELY INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION, AND LITIGATION BEFORE THE COURTS OF A HOST STATE. INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION IS THE MAINSTREAM FORUM, AS INVESTMENT TREATIES SUPPORT IT. BOTH FORA HAVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION IS EXPENSIVE, IT TAKES TIME TO CONCLUDE, AND IT LACKS AN APPEAL MECHANISM. LITIGATION FACES CHALLENGES SUCH AS: A POOR STATE OF RULE OF LAW; THERE MAY BE NO GUARANTEE OF AN EFFICIENT AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM BY A HOST STATE; LOCAL COURTS MAY LACK INDEPENDENCE; AND LITIGATION MAY TAKE TIME TO CONCLUDE, THUS RESULTING IN COSTLY LITIGATION. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE PROS AND CONS OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AND LITIGATION, AND CONCLUDES THAT LITIGATION IS INDISPENSABLE IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION, WHILE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION CAN BE NECESSARY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS POOR, ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE DISPENSED WITH WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS SATISFACTORY. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT NOTES THAT INVESTORS GENERALLY PREFER INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. IN THE AFRICAN CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE USE OF THE AFRICAN JUSTICE SCOREBOARD AS A GATEWAY TO THE COURTS OF HOST STATES. THE SCOREBOARD WILL ENSURE THAT INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES ARE ONLY REFERRED TO THE COURTS OF HOST STATES THAT HAVE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
283	THE PRESENT PAPPER AIMS TO ANALYSE THE CULTURAL HERITAGE RESTORATION, DESTROYED DURING THE VANDALISM ACTS IN THE THREE POWER'S SQUARE IN BRASILIA, ON JANUARY 8TH OF 2023, AS A TOOL FOR REINFORCE THE BRAZILIAN DEMOCRATIC STATE RESTORATION OF CULTURAL PROPERTY DESTROYED BY ACTS OF VANDALISM AT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIARY BRANCHES, ON JANUARY 8, 2023, AS A MEANS OF STRENGTHENING THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO PROPOSES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURAL GOODS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN THE ATTACK ON THE BUILDINGS, WHICH CAUSED SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL DAMAGE TO THE COUNTRY. ALL IN ALL, ITS RESTORATION TRANSLATES INTO THE REINFORCEMENT OF AN UNSHAKEABLE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. LASTLY, IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE POLITICAL POLARIZATION OF THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION AND THE VIOLENCE COMMITTED ON JANUARY THE 8TH, ALTHOUGH THREATENING THE DEMOCRACY, DO NOT QUALIFY AS AN ACT AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
284	THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION OVER ILLICIT ACTIVITIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA IS THE FOCUS OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE. IT IS POSITED THAT ENHANCEMENT OF THE ORDRE PUBLIC AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REQUIRES THE PRIOR ESTABLISHMENT OF PRECISE, FORESEEABLE AND ACCESSIBLE DOMESTIC LAWS, AS WELL AS OF THE REQUISITE JURISDICTIONAL NEXUS BETWEEN THE FORUM STATE AND THE ILLICIT ACTIVITY. ACCORDINGLY, THE ISSUE OF LEGISLATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTION OVER SUCH ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS THE SMUGGLING OF MIGRANTS, DRUG TRAFFICKING AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM WILL BE CANVASSED. THESE ACTIVITIES AND THE THREATS THEY POSE FOR THE SECURITY AND THE PUBLIC ORDER OF THE STATES BORDERING THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA LOOM LARGE IN THE CURRENT DISCOURSE OVER ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN THE REGION. HOWEVER, THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION HAS MAINLY BEEN ENFORCEMENT AS SUCH, AND NOT THE NEED FOR PRIOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTION.
285	THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE EFFECTS OF FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND LEGAL ASPECTS ON THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONTROL ON CORRUPTION. OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY CAN REDUCE INFORMATION ASYMMETRY AND, THUS, THE EXISTING DISCRETIONARY POWER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO ARGUE THAT FISCAL TRANSPARENCY AND A STRONG LEGAL SYSTEM MIGHT BE ABLE TO INCREASE THE EXPECTED COST OF CORRUPTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE DETERRENT EFFECT AGAINST CORRUPTION, ONCE IT INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF CORRUPT OFFICIALS, POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS BEING CAUGHT, REPRESENTING IMPORTANT ASPECTS ABLE TO INCREASE THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONTROL ON CORRUPTION. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 82 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2006-2014 AND USING PANEL DATA METHODOLOGY, OUR STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY GUIDELINES SINCE THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MORE TRANSPARENT FISCAL PRACTICES BRING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN TERMS OF CORRUPTION PERCEPTION. MOREOVER, THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW ON THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONTROL ON CORRUPTION BECOMES GREATER AS FISCAL TRANSPARENCY INCREASES (THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW ON THIS PERCEPTION INCREASES WITH FISCAL TRANSPARENCY IMPROVEMENTS). THE FINDINGS ALSO REVEAL THAT A STRONG LEGAL SYSTEM (REPRESENTED BY A STRONG RULE OF LAW, INTEGRITY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND IMPARTIAL AND EFFECTIVE COURTS THAT GUARANTEE LAW ENFORCEMENT) INCREASES THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONTROL ON CORRUPTION.
286	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE MAIN CONTRADICTIONS EXISTING IN ECUADOR FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS; THE NEW LEGAL THEORY, WHICH SEEKS TO TRANSFORM THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, PROPOSING FOR IT; GREATER STATE INTERVENTION AND CREATION OF EGALITARIAN DEMOCRATIC SPACES AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AMONG STATE AGENCIES AND INSTITUTIONS. FOR THIS REASON, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE CONSOLIDATION OF NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM IN ECUADOR, AS AN IDEOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL THEORY OF LAW. IN ORDER TO CHARACTERIZE THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE CONSOLIDATION OF NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM IN ECUADOR, THE PESTEL METHODOLOGY BASED ON NEUTROSOPHIC COGNITIVE MAPS IS USED, WHICH CONSTITUTES A TOOL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ANALYZES POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, ECOLOGICAL AND LEGAL FACTORS. A DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT THAT DEALS WITH THE PRETENTIOUS MATERIALS OF THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM IN ECUADOR, FROM ITS CONTEXTUALIZATION.
287	THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM SETS THE PARAMETERS SUPPORTED BY THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD GUIDE THE ACTIONS OF INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIETY, AS WELL AS IN THE STAGE OF THE STATE ORGANIZATION IS THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT THAT BRINGS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS TO ACHIEVE GENERAL WELFARE.
288	THE RESEARCH PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE IS A PRODUCT OF MY U.S. SUPREME COURT FELLOWSHIP IN THE OFFICE OF THE COUNSELOR TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE. FOUNDED IN 1973 BY FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN BURGER, THE PURPOSE OF THE SUPREME COURT FELLOWS PROGRAM IS TO BRING MID-CAREER PROFESSIONALS INTERESTED IN JUDICIAL BRANCH GOVERNANCE TO WASHINGTON TO HELP ADVANCE THE MISSION AND GOALS OF THE JUDICIARY. WORKING FOR AN OFFICE THAT SERVES AS AN EXTENSION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S CHAMBERS PROVIDED UNPARALLELED ACCESS TO LEARN FIRST-HAND (A) HOW THE FEDERAL COURTS ARE MANAGED AND OPERATED; (B) HOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES DIRECTS THE MANAGERIAL, BUDGETARY, AND POLICY PRIORITIES OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY; AND (C) HOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT CULTIVATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES TO SECURE THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM TO CARRY OUT ITS CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND JUDICIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON SEQUESTRATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICY AND BUDGETARY ISSUE CURRENTLY AFFECTING THE U.S. FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM, AND A TOPIC THAT WAS A FOCAL POINT DURING MY FELLOWSHIP YEAR. CURRENTLY, EXTREME BUDGET CUTS ARE PROHIBITING THE FEDERAL COURTS AND JUDICIAL BRANCH AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE INDIVIDUALS THEY SERVE. IF CONGRESS CONTINUES ENFORCING THE SEQUESTER, THE THIRD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER IN AN EFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE, AND RESPONSIVE MANNER. CONSEQUENTLY, THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES IS IN JEOPARDY.
289	THIS CROSS-DISCIPLINARY CONTRIBUTION ASKS, WHY THE EROSION OF RULE OF LAW AS PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC BACKLASH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN 'EASTERN EUROPE'. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE QUESTION IS ABOUT PRESTIGE, IN WHICH POLAND AND HUNGARY ARE STRUGGLING FOR A GREATER STATUS AND SOCIAL RECOGNITION AS 'MIDDLE POWERS'. IN THIS SEARCH OF PRESTIGE LONG HISTORY MATTERS, AND PRESTIGE AND POWER IS EASILY CONSIDERED TO HAVE A PRIORITY BEFORE THE RULE OF LAW, AS PRACTICE BEFORE THEORY, AND 'REALISM' BEFORE 'LIBERALISM'. AT FIRST, THE ARTICLE REVISITS THE POLITICS OF CARTOGRAPHY AND UPDATES DEBATES OF NAMING, AS THE CONCEPTS OF 'EASTERN EUROPE', 'CENTRAL EUROPE', OR 'EAST CENTRAL EUROPE' REMAIN CONTESTED. FURTHERMORE, THE EXPERIENCE OF DIFFERENCE IS LOCATED IN IDEAS OF SEPARATING 'EAST' AND 'WEST' AND TO THE STATUS OF DEMOCRACY ON THE CONTINENT. AS THE ARTICLE PARTICULARLY COMPARES POLAND AND HUNGARY, SPECIAL CHAPTERS ARE DEDICATED TO THEIR CENTURIES OLD HISTORIES AND MUTUAL FRIENDSHIP. EMPIRICAL EXAMPLES COME FROM CURRENT DISCUSSIONS ON 'ILLIBERAL' AND 'FLAWED' DEMOCRACY AS THE POLISH THREE SEAS INITIATIVE.
290	INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION, ALSO CALLED INVESTMENT ARBITRATION, IS OFTEN ACCUSED OF HARMING DEVELOPING STATES FACING ECONOMIC HARDSHIP FOR THE BENEFIT OF A WEALTHY FEW FROM THE GLOBAL NORTH. ITS PROPONENTS RESPOND THAT IT IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IMPARTIALLY, AND THAT ITS INCREASED USE CLARIFIES INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE THE EMPIRICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE USES AND FUNCTIONS OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION, WITH AN ORIGINAL DATASET THAT COMPILES OVER 500 ARBITRATION CLAIMS FROM 1972 TO 2010. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT UNTIL THE MID-TO-LATE 1990S, INVESTMENT ARBITRATION WAS MAINLY USED IN TWO WAYS. ON THE ONE HAND, IT WAS A NEO-COLONIAL INSTRUMENT TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF DEVELOPED STATES. ON THE OTHER, IT WAS A MEANS TO IMPOSE THE RULE OF LAW IN NON-DEMOCRATIC STATES WITH A WEAK LAW AND ORDER TRADITION. BUT SINCE THE MID-TO-LATE 1990S, THE MAIN FUNCTION OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE GUIDEPOSTS AND DETERMINE RIGHTS FOR INVESTORS AND HOST STATES, AND THUS TO INCREASE THE PREDICTABILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT REGIME. IN DOING SO, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO FAVOUR THE 'HAVES' OVER THE 'HAVE-NOTS', MAKING THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT REGIME HARDER ON POORER THAN ON RICHER COUNTRIES.
291	USING PANEL DATA FOR THE YEARS 2006-2015, THIS STUDY EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW AS AN INSTITUTION ON BANGLADESH'S EXPORTS TO 28 EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES (EU28) BASED ON GRAVITY MODEL ANALYSIS. TWO-STEP ECONOMETRIC RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH BANGLADESH'S EXPORTS, AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. FURTHERMORE, EXPORTS OF BANGLADESH ARE DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC SIZE, MARKET SIZE, AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE AS WELL AS RULE OF LAW. THESE RESULTS ARE SUGGESTIVE OF AN IMPORTANT JOINT ROLE FOR BOTH TRADE AND INSTITUTIONS IN THE LONG RUN.
292	MICHAEL TREBILCOCK IS PASSIONATELY COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF THE POOR. AS PART OF THIS PROJECT, HE HAS WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ON THE EFFORT TO BOLSTER THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND TO IMPROVE THE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS FOUND IN THESE COUNTRIES. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF HIS RECENT BOOK ON THIS SUBJECT, RULE OF LAW REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT (WRITTEN WITH RON DANIELS), THIS ESSAY EXAMINES TREBILCOCK'S METHOD AND PHILOSOPHIC ORIENTATION AND SHOWS HOW HIS MORAL SENSIBILITIES HAVE LED HIM TO DEPART FROM THE CLASSIC TENETS OF LAW AND ECONOMICS AND TO OPEN NEW VISTAS FOR THIS BRANCH OF LEGAL ANALYSIS.
293	AMID HEATED DEBATES OVER UNCURBED CORRUPTION IN THE JUDICIARY, OVER PROFESSIONALIZATION OR POPULARIZATION OF THE PEOPLE'S JUDGE, LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE JUDGMENT MAKING PROCESS, INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND SO ON, A NEW ROUND OF JUDICIAL REFORM WAS LAUNCHED IN MARCH 2009 WITH THE RELEASE OF "THIRD FIVE-YEAR AGENDA FOR THE REFORM OF PEOPLE'S COURTS" BY THE SUPREME COURT OF PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. FEW IN-DEPTH STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE HOWEVER, TO REVEAL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE CONTROVERSIES AND LEGAL REASONING AS A BASIC SKILL OF LEGAL PRACTICE AND RESEARCH. THIS PAPER COMPARES AND ANALYZES HOW THE ALLIED SWISS AND CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEMS FACILITATE JUSTICE THROUGH REASONED JUDGMENT, AND CONCLUDES THAT LEGAL REASONING IS A STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN THE CHINESE JUDICATURE, LEGAL EDUCATION, AND LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, A DEFICIENCY WHICH IS THE ROOT OF VARIOUS PROBLEMS FUELLING CURRENT DEBATES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CHINA'S LEGISLATURE, JUDICIARY, AND LEGAL EDUCATION POLICY MAKERS FOR HOW TO STRENGTHEN LEGAL REASONING AND THEREBY RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE ON-GOING LEGAL REFORM.
294	MAGNA CARTA IS OFTEN HERALDED AS THE FOUNDATION STONE FOR THE SUBSEQUENT EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ENGLAND. BUT WHAT MADE IT ENFORCEABLE AND ENSURED THAT ITS TERMS WERE ADHERED TO BY SUBSEQUENT MONARCHS? THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AN INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNT OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND THAT DRAWS ON THE WORK OF NORTH, WALLIS AND WEINGAST (2009). I ARGUE THAT THE MAGNA CARTA SHOULD BE SEEN AS JUST ONE EPISODE IN THE LONG PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A CENTRALIZED BUT CONSTRAINED STATE IN ENGLAND. SIMILAR DOCUMENTS TO MAGNA CARTA WERE COMMON THROUGHOUT MEDIEVAL EUROPE. IT WAS THE SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF A CONSENSUS-BASED TAX STATE THAT WAS OF DECISIVE IMPORTANT FOR THE LATER EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN MEDIEVAL AND EARLY MODERN ENGLAND. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
295	COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY (CSDP) POLICE/RULE OF LAW MISSIONS IN THE WESTERN BALKANS ARE INCREASINGLY GUIDED BY EXTERNALLY IMPOSED NORMATIVE AGENDAS THAT RESPOND PRIMARILY TO EU INTERNAL SECURITY NEEDS RATHER THAN FUNCTIONAL IMPERATIVES OR LOCAL REALITIES. IN LINE WITH THESE NEEDS, EU POLICE REFORM EFFORTS TEND TO PRIORITISE EFFECTIVENESS AND CRIME FIGHTING OVER LONGER-TERM DEMOCRATIC POLICING AND GOOD GOVERNANCE REFORMS. IN PRACTICE THIS MEANS THAT POLICE REFORM INITIATIVES ARETECHNOCRATICALLY ORIENTED, YET VALUE RIDDEN FITTING EU SECURITY CONCERNS AND NEEDS. AS A RESULT, THE POLICE REFORM PROCESS CAN BE-AND OFTEN IS-DISCONNECTED FROM THE POLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC REFORMS NECESSARY FOR LONGTERM STABILITY AND SUSTAINABLE PEACE. POLICE ASSISTANCE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA HAS BEEN SHAPED BY A DETERMINED ALBEIT QUESTIONABLE FOCUS ON ORGANISED CRIME AND CORRUPTION. THE FOCUS OF EU POLICE REFORM IN MACEDONIA ON PRIMARILY CRIME-FIGHTING ASPECTS OF POLICING HAS COMPROMISED THEFUNCTIONING OF THE MACEDONIAN POLICE. SIMILARLY, THE POLITICS OF (NON-) RECOGNITION OF KOSOVO'S SELF-PROCLAIMED INDEPENDENCE AND THE INTRUSIVENESS OF EULEX KOSOVO'S EXECUTIVE MANDATE CONTRAVENE MEETING LOCAL CHALLENGES.
296	IN HIS RECENT BOOK, IAN HURD ARGUES THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW IS PERVASIVE AND FOUNDATIONAL IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS HEGEMONIC OVER STATES. WHILE THE BOOK IS PROVOCATIVE AND COMPELLING, IT FAILS TO CONVINCE ON TWO CORE POINTS. FIRST, HURD DOES NOT OFFER A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS REALISM. INDEED, THE BOOK COULD UNWITTINGLY REINFORCE THE REALIST STANCE THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW IS SIMPLY POWER POLITICS IN DISGUISE. SECOND, THE BOOK OFFERS A PROBLEMATIC CONCEPTION OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. WHAT HURD DESCRIBES IS AT BEST A RULE BY LAW, OR PERHAPS MORE APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED AS A TRAVESTY OF THE RULE OF LAW.
297	THE FATE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN FRAGILE STATES RESTS IN RELIGIOUS POLITICS. THREE DEFINING PERIODS OF SOMALI POLITICS ILLUSTRATE THIS ARGUMENT. FIRST IS THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME OF MOHAMED SIAD BARRE IN SOMALIA (1969-1991). THIS DICTATORSHIP USED RELIGION TO RULE BY LAW. THE REGIME EXECUTED RELIGIOUS LEADERS FOR DISAGREEING WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERPRETATION OF ISLAM. SECOND IS THE RISE OF ISLAMIC COURTS IN MOGADISHU, SOMALIA'S CAPITAL CITY (1991-2007). THE ISLAMIC COURTS APPREHENDED CRIMINALS, EXPELLED WARLORDS, AND PROVIDED SPACES FOR SOMALIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES PEACEFULLY. THIRD IS THE BREAKAWAY OF SOMALILAND (1991-PRESENT). SOMALILAND HAS ADVANCED ISLAMIC LEGAL PRINCIPLES TO BUILD PEACE AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE THREE PERIODS DEMONSTRATE HOW RELIGIOUS POLITICS TRANSFORM LAW AND SOCIETY.
298	THE POSSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE A "DIRECT ACTION" TO CHALLENGE THE NORMS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BEFORE THE JUDGE OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY IS NOT A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE INSTITUTION. "FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS" DOES NOT REQUIRE, AS SUCH, THAT THE JUDGE OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PARLIAMENTARY STATUTES SHOULD GRANT THEIR PROTECTION. WHAT ALLOWS DISTINGUISHING THE DIFFERENT MODELS IS THE DEGREE OF THE CONCENTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THESE BASIC TASKS: PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, CONSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS DEPENDS UPON VARIOUS FACTORS: HOW EXHAUST THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL REVIEW SHOULD BE, WHAT KIND OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPERVISION MAY BE (PREVENTIVE OR CORRECTIVE), THE NUMBER OF THE ORGANS CHARGED WITH THIS TASK, AND THE NUMBER OF ITS COMPONENTS. THE QUESTION OF THE LIMITATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS RISEN, BECAUSE THE MORE EXHAUSTIVE ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS INTENDED, THE LESS INTENSE, GENERATING A PARADOXAL WEAKNESS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND THE COMPLETENESS PRINCIPIE. A PHENOMENON APPEARS: THE MUTATION OF THE "MONOMICRODICASTIC" PRINCIPIE AND THE COMPLETENESS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL REVIEW.
299	THIS ARTICLE'S CONCERN IS TO STUDY, BRIEFLY, TWO ISSUES THAT IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW HAVE A CLOSE RELATION WITH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, AS THEY ARE DEFINED BY THE INTERNATIONAL LAW INSTRUMENT, SUCH AS THE INTERAMERICAN DEMOCRATIC CHARTER OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. BOTH ISSUES ARE RELATED WITH THE TOTAL REFORM OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL LAW, WHICH FINALIZED WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE NEW POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE (NCPE, IN SPANISH). ABOUT THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE ARTICLES ANALYSES THE MODEL OF STATE IT PROPOSES, THE DIVISION OF POWERS AND THE JUDICIARY. ITS CONCLUSION IS THE NECESSITY OF MODIFYING THE CONSTITUTION, BECAUSE OF THE NON REGULAR CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING ITS APPROBATION.
300	HOW DO FIRMS ENSURE SECURE EXCHANGE WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK AND CONTRACTING INSTITUTIONS PRIVILEGE THE POLITICALLY CONNECTED? IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, FIRMS MAY USE SOCIAL, FORMAL, OR POLITICAL HEURISTICS WHEN SELECTING BUSINESS PARTNERS, BUT HOW THESE FACTORS JOINTLY IMPACT EXCHANGE REMAINS UNDERSTUDIED. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DEVELOP THESE THEORETICAL MECHANISMS AND TEST THEIR IMPACT WITH A CONJOINT EXPERIMENT ADMINISTERED TO 2389 FORMAL AND INFORMAL FIRMS IN SENEGAL. I FIND EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF ALL THREE THEORIES: TO VARYING DEGREES, SOCIAL, STATE, AND POLITICAL FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPACT FIRMS' SENSE OF DEAL SECURITY AND LIKELIHOOD OF EXCHANGE. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OF FORMAL PREDICTORS OF EXCHANGE EVEN IN AN OVERWHELMINGLY INFORMAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND ALSO ESTABLISH THE COUNTERVAILING EFFECTS OF POLITICAL CONNECTIONS ON TRADE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT FIRMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES MUST CONTEND WITH AN INTRICATE POLITICAL CALCULUS TO ENSURE THEIR GROWTH.
301	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS IN THE MIDST OF WHAT COULD BE DEEMED THE BIGGEST THREAT TO ITS CURRENT ORDER SINCE ITS INCEPTION: MEMBER STATES BACKSLIDING ON EU FOUNDING VALUES. INDEED, THE EU IS SHOWING NO SIGN OF HAVING THE RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING CRISIS UNDER CONTROL IN STATES SUCH AS HUNGARY AND POLAND, A DECADE SINCE THE FIRST SIGNS OF POPULIST TAKEOVERS EMERGED. SINCE THE FOUNDATIONAL VALUES OF LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY WERE FIRST CHALLENGED IN THESE TWO CENTRAL EASTERN EUROPEAN (CEE) COUNTRIES, SIMILAR ISSUES IN OTHER MEMBER STATES HAVE ALSO COME TO LIGHT, SUCH AS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND MALTA, AMONGST OTHERS. HOWEVER, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC STABILITY OF OTHER STATES THAT ALSO ACCEDED TO THE EU IN 2004. THIS PAPER IS A STOCKTAKING EXERCISE WHICH AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN RELATION TO THE FIDELITY OF LATVIA TO THE FOUNDING EU VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW 18 YEARS SINCE IT BECAME AN EU MEMBER. IT WILL EXAMINE THE STATE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN LATVIA DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS. ATTACKS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE THE MAIN BATTLEGROUND ON WHICH THE EU IS FIGHTING HUNGARY AND POLAND, AND A VALUE THAT IS CONSIDERED CENTRAL TO THE EU'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND LATVIA'S CURRENT STATE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN ORDER TO BUILD A BROADER PICTURE OF THE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ALL MEMBER STATES. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL HELP TO FIGHT THE EU'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS AND THE RISE OF POPULISM. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER SO THAT THE EU CAN STAND UNITED AGAINST AN EVER MORE AGGRESSIVE RUSSIA TO THE EAST.
302	DURING THE RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING CRISIS IN POLAND SINCE LATE 2015, CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS) HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE STRUGGLES TO DEFEND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. CSOS COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH JUDGES AND SUPPORT THEIR 'JUDICIAL RESISTANCE'. THIS ARTICLE HAS THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES: DESCRIBE AND ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDGES AND CSOS; SHOW THE EVOLUTION - BOTH CONTINUITY AND DISCONTINUITY IN THEIR RELATIONS OVER TIME; ASSESS WHETHER CSOS' ACTIVITIES ARE OF ANY PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND THEREFORE WORTH ATTENTION. THE CSO-JUDICIAL RELATIONSHIP IS ANALYZED FOR THREE PERIODS: 1976-1989, THE YEARS BEFORE THE TRANSFORMATION OF POLAND FROM A 'PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC' TO A DEMOCRACY; 1989-2015, THE TIME OF BUILDING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW; 2015-2020, THE TIME OF DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW FROM A POPULIST ATTACK. DRAWING ON SOURCES INCLUDING YEARS OF PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION PROVIDING UNIQUE AND INSIDER KNOWLEDGE, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE ACTIVITIES AND OUTPUTS OF CSOS AND JUDGES FOCUSING ON THEIR INTERACTIONS AND COOPERATION. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT CSOS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT CSOS' CURRENT ENGAGEMENT AND INPUT IS NOT AN EXTRAORDINARY, AD HOC PHENOMENON, BUT RATHER ONE THAT AROSE FROM THE PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE JUDICIARY AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT WHAT WE WITNESS IN POLAND IS AN UNPRECEDENTED PHENOMENON, BOTH IN THE CHARACTER OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDGES AND CSOS, AND THE SCALE AND DIVERSITY OF THEIR COOPERATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT CSOS ARE UNDERAPPRECIATED, INCLUDING BY ACADEMIA, THEIR WORK IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED, AND THEIR ROLE IN THE LEGAL COMPLEX CAN BE SEEN AS A PARTLY LOST OPPORTUNITY. IF NOTICED, APPRECIATED, AND SUPPORTED CSOS ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ROLE COULD BE MORE MEANINGFUL.
303	THE CONCEPT OF DEMOCRACY OUGHT TO BE APPROACHED BY EXAMINING ITS ESSENTIALS AS CONTENTS OF THE TERM. IT SHOULD BE KNOWN FROM THE OUTSET THAT DEMOCRACY EXPRESSES BOTH PRINCIPLES AND IDEAL. THAT IS, PRINCIPLES, WHICH THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY WISH TO BE GIVEN PRACTICAL EXPRESSION IN THE LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE SOCIETY; AND IDEALS WHICH PROVIDE GOALS TOWARD WHICH MAN IN SOCIETY SHOULD CONSTANTLY ASPIRE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE SOCIETY. FROM THE FORE-GOING, THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER SHALL NOT BE ADHERED OR CENTERED ON THE DEFINITION OF DEMOCRACY ALONE BUT RATHER ON THE ESSENCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ON WHICH THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRACY AS A POLITICAL IDEOLOGY AND SYSTEM STANDS AND RESTS. MEANING THAT, IT IS TO THEMATIZE THAT WITHOUT AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A FUNCTIONAL RULE OF LAW, SUCH DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM BECOMES A SHAM AND POINTLESS. AND FOR PROPER INSIGHT OF THIS PAPER, THEREFORE, ITS METHODOLOGY SHALL BE PURELY EXPOSITORY, CRITICAL AND ANALYTICAL. THIS IDEA AND IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ANY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, IF GIVEN A PRIORITY WILL PORTRAY GOOD GOVERNANCE IN HUMAN SOCIETY.
304	THE CONCILIATORY PROFILE OF LAWYERS IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW AND THE LATEST TRENDS IN THIS PROFESSION ARE ANALYZED IN THIS PAPER. THE NEGOTIATOR PROFILE CAN BE ASSUMED APPLYING ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS FOR PROBLEM-SOLVING AND COMMUNITY, RESTORATIVE, AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MODELS. THIS CRITICAL APPROACH AIMS TO SERVE AS A REFERENT IN THE PROCESSES OF CURRICULUM TRANSFORMATION, ACCREDITATION, AND IN GENERAL TERMS, QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OF LAW PROGRAMS. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE KIND OF LAWYERS WANTED FOR THE FUTURE IS UNAVOIDABLE AND THE SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY SHOULD THOROUGHLY CARRY IT OUT FOR THE PROCESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THIS PAPER COMES ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT "THE IMPACT OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN SOCIAL RULE OF LAW: A CASE STUDY OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT GRADUATE STUDENTS OF UNIVERSIDAD DE LA COSTA", PERFORMED IN 2011.
305	PLACING CONSTRAINTS ON ELECTED OFFICIALS IS THOUGHT TO BIND THEIR HANDS AND RENDER GOVERNMENT POLICIES CREDIBLE. IN TURN, CREDIBLE POLICIES ATTRACT INVESTMENT BECAUSE INVESTORS CAN EXTEND THEIR POLICY AND REGULATORY TIME HORIZONS. YET, A SCHOLARSHIP ON LMICS SUGGESTS THAT TOO MANY CONSTRAINTS ON POLICYMAKERS MAY PRECLUDE NECESSARY REFORMS, WHICH REPELS CAPITAL. I MOTIVATE THE STUDY WITH AN EXAMPLE FROM LIBERIA. THEN, I EVALUATE POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS AND FDI FOR 182 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2022 AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONSTRAINTS ON GOVERNMENTS AND FDI; IN PLACES WITH HIGH RULE OF LAW, CONSTRAINING GOVERNMENT ATTRACTS FDI. IN CONTRAST, HIGH CONSTRAINTS PUSH INVESTMENT AWAY IN CONTEXTS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS LOWER. THE LOGIC IS THAT CONSTRAINING GOVERNMENT MAKES CREDIBLE HIGH-INCOME GOVERNMENTS' PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS TO PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER, THE VERY SAME CONSTRAINTS ON GOVERNMENT MAY PREVENT LMICS FROM MAKING CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. CONSTRAINING GOVERNMENT THUS PREVENTS DESIRABLE REFORMS UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH I ILLUSTRATE BY RETURNING TO THE LIBERIA EXAMPLE IN THE DISCUSSION. ULTIMATELY, THIS STUDY RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT UNIVERSAL BENEFITS EMERGING FROM POLICY CREDIBILITY AND EXTENDS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, CREDIBLE COMMITMENT, AND FDI.
306	THE SUBJECT OF THIS ARTICLE IS THE NORMS OF CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS THE AUTHOR'S VISION OF THE PROBLEM CONCERNING THE STRUCTURE OF THE NORMS OF CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN LAW. THE FOLLOWING TASKS WERE SOLVED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL: 1) TO SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW; 2) TO ANALYZE THE ARGUMENTS OF BOTH SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS OF THE THREE-TIER STRUCTURE OF THE LOGICAL RULE OF LAW; 3) SUBSTANTIATE THE TWO-TIER STRUCTURE OF PRESCRIPTIVE NORMS; 4) DETERMINE THE STATUS OF SPECIALIZED LEGAL NORMS AND THEIR TYPES; 5) TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AUTHOR'S VISION OF SPECIALIZED LEGAL NORMS. THE AUTHOR USES A SYSTEM OF METHODS SUCH AS: GENERAL PHILOSOPHICAL (DIALECTICAL-MATERIALISTIC), GENERAL SCIENTIFIC (ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION, ETC.), SPECIAL (PHILOLOGICAL, ETC.), PRIVATE SCIENTIFIC (FORMAL-DOGMATIC, INTERPRETATION, ETC.) METHODS. CONCLUSIONS. THE AUTHOR IS NOT A SUPPORTER OF THE THREE-TIER STRUCTURE OF THE LOGICAL NORM OF LAW. IT SEEMS THAT THEORY AND LEGAL PRACTICE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE STRUCTURE OF NORMS-PRESCRIPTIONS (REGULATORY AND PROTECTIVE), RESPECTIVELY HIGHLIGHTING THE HYPOTHESIS AND DISPOSITION AND THE HYPOTHESIS AND SANCTION. AS FOR THE SPECIALIZED NORMS OF LAW (DECLARATIVE, NORM-PRINCIPLES, DEFINITIVE, OPERATIONAL), THEY INCLUDE SUCH STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS AS A SUPPOSED HYPOTHESIS AND A REAL DISPOSITION. CONFLICT NORMS AS A KIND OF SPECIALIZED NORMS INCLUDE A REAL HYPOTHESIS AND A REAL DISPOSITION.
307	IN EARLY 2021, THE HIGH COURT HELD BY A 4:3 MAJORITY IN MZAPC V MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND BORDER PROTECTION THAT AN APPLICANT IN JUDICIAL REVIEW PROCEEDINGS BEARS THE ONUS OF PROVING THAT A LEGAL ERROR COMMITTED IN THE COURSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING BY REASON OF ITS MATERIALITY CONSTITUTES A JURISDICTIONAL ERROR. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS SUPPORT FOR THE POSITION OF THE MINORITY JUDGES BY PROMOTING AND EXPANDING UPON THE OBJECTION TAKEN BY GORDON AND STEWARD JJ ON THE BASIS OF PRESERVING THE RULE OF LAW. IT CONTENDS THAT THE PRINCIPLED RECONCILIATION OF THREE CONSIDERATIONS, NAMELY THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWER BE JUSTIFIED, THE PROTECTIVE QUALITIES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH JURISDICTIONAL ERROR FINDS EXPRESSION AND TAKES MEANING, REQUIRES THAT THE EXECUTIVE BEAR THE ONUS OF DEMONSTRATING THE IMMATERIALITY OF ITS LEGAL ERROR AS A MEANS OF DEMONSTRATING THAT ITS ERROR IS NON-JURISDICTIONAL.
308	THE JURIST A. V. DICEY'S STUDY OF THE LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION (1885) HAS BEEN SINCE ITS PUBLICATION THE DOMINANT ANALYSIS OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AND THE SOURCE OF ORTHODOXY ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CANONICAL STATUS HAS OBSCURED THE ORIGINALITY OF DICEY'S IDEAS IN THE HISTORY OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL THOUGHT. DICEY REWORKED THE TRADITIONAL IDEA OF SOVEREIGNTY INTO TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS - LEGAL AND POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY - IN ORDER TO SQUARE THE COMMON LAW NOTION OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF PARLIAMENT WITH THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA OF THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE. HE FORGED A NEW CONCEPT - 'THE RULE OF LAW' - TO EXPLAIN THE LEGAL BASIS OF LIBERTY IN COMMON LAW COUNTRIES IN A MANNER THAT WAS BOTH BENTHAMITE AND CONSTITUTIONALIST. FINALLY, HE PROVIDED A DEMOCRATIC AND ANTI-FEDERALIST RATIONALE FOR MAINTAINING THE UNION OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. THIS MAJORITARIAN, CENTRALIST AND UTILITARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING PRODUCTS OF VICTORIAN SCHOLARSHIP. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO RECOVER IT IN ITS ORIGINAL CONTEXT AND, IN SO DOING, TO SHOW THE VALUE OF REINTEGRATING LEGAL THOUGHT INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF MODERN BRITISH HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT.
309	"CIVILIZATIONS DIE FROM SUICIDE, NOT BY MURDER." ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE IN THE PRESENT PAPER I AM GOING TO ANALYSE THE DISCOURSE ABOUT THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RESPONSES TO THE TERRORIST CHALLENGE IN THE US AND IN EUROPE (ESPECIALLY IN GERMANY).1 BESIDES SHOWING THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE DISCOURSE IS COMPLICATED BUT ALSO SURPRISINGLY SIMILAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF IMPLIED PRESUPPOSITIONS EXPLAIN DISAGREEMENTS IN THE DEBATES. I AM ALSO GOING TO ARGUE ON A PRAGMATIC2 BASIS THAT A NEW PARADIGM (OR RATHER: LOOSENING OUR IDEA) OF THE RULE OF LAW IS UNNECESSARY, EVEN DANGEROUS AS WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO TACKLE THE ORIGINAL CHALLENGE FOR WHICH RULE OF LAW WAS DEVELOPED, NAMELY THE LIMITATION OF OR FIGHT AGAINST THE ARBITRARY USE OF GOVERNMENT POWER. GIVING UP THIS IDEA, ESPECIALLY AN INTEGRAL PART OF IT, THE PROHIBITION OF TORTURE, WOULD ALSO ENDANGER THE IDENTITY OF WESTERN SOCIETIES. IN EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS, ON AN AD HOC BASIS, THE BREACH OF CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS MIGHT, HOWEVER, BE MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES OR THE CONSTITUTION AS A WHOLE. BUT THE ILLEGALITY OF THESE ACTS HAS TO REMAIN CLEAR.
310	THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE SHOWS THE EXPERIENCES OF REFORM IN CRIMINAL MATTER IN SOME COUNTRIES OF LATIN AMERICA SUCH AS ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, AND MEXICO, IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE RELATION BETWEEN AND IMPORTANCE OF THE JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EMERGING DEMOCRACIES, THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND ELIAS DIAZ'S CONCEPT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW RULE OF LAW. A COMPARISON OF THE RESEARCH DONE IN THESE COUNTRIES WAS MADE, DEFINING COMMON INDICATORS. THE TEXT SHOWS HOW ALTERNATIVE JUSTICE HELPS TO STRENGTHEN THE RELATION BETWEEN JUSTICE AND CITIZENSHIP, FOR IT ALLOWS THE PARTICIPATION OF THE VICTIM AND ACCUSED PARTIES IN ORDER TO REACH A DAMAGE REPARATION AGREEMENT. IN THE SAME WAY, THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED, SUCH AS THE CONFLICT RESOLUTION ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS IN MEXICO, BRAZIL AND COLOMBIA, THE TRIALS BY JURY IN ARGENTINA, AS WELL AS THE DEFICIENCIES THAT MUST BE REPAIRED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN FULL.
311	THE TEXT AIMS TO PORTRAY THE EMERGENCE OF THE CRIMINALITY MYTH SINCE 90S, ESPECIALLY IN SAO PAULO. THIS IS NOT AN HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CRIMINAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT EMERGE FROM THE DIFFICULTIES ON MANAGE THE RULE OF LAW. BY ALL ODDS, THE NUANCES OF REALITY POINTED IN THE TEXT ARE ADEQUATE TO PUT IN DIFFERENT SIDES THE SOCIAL IRRATIONALITY AND THE JURIDICAL FORMALISM.
312	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS UK GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSAL TO RE-INTRODUCE AN ACCELERATED APPEALS SYSTEM FOR DETAINED ASYLUM SEEKERS THROUGH RESORT TO LEGISLATION. PREVIOUSLY, A SIMILAR SYSTEM, THE `DETAINED FAST TRACK, WAS RULED UNLAWFUL LARGELY ON THE BASIS THAT IT LACKED PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, A CORE TENET OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. IT ADOPTS A FOR-MAL NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN PROTECTING ASYLUM SEEKER'S RIGHTS, AS A SUB-GROUP OF `UNWANTED MIGRANTS'. THIS IS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM AND LEGAL CHALLENGES TO IT TO EXPLORE THE DEFICIENCY OF LEGALITY OF THE SYSTEM AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. THREE STAGES OF THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM ARE EXAMINED, ITS INCEPTION, ITS SURVIVAL OF EARLY LEGAL CHALLENGES AND ITS EVENTUAL DEMISE TO EXPOSE THE MARGINALISATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SAFEGUARDS.
313	LAW, BY ITS VERY NATURE, IS HUMAN AND HUMANE. THE HUMANITY OF LAW MEANS THAT LAW IS A PRODUCT OF MAN AND IS INTENDED FOR MAN. THE HUMANENESS OF LAW, HOWEVER, MEANS THAT HUMAN DIGNITY AND WELL-BEING MUST BE THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF LAW. LAW, THEREFORE, DOES NOT EXIST WITHOUT A SUFFICIENT ETHICAL FOUNDATION. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, AND A LEGAL CULTURE BASED ON IT REQUIRES A PARTICULARLY STRONG ANCHORING OF LAW IN ETHICAL VALUES. THE GREATEST THREATS TO ETHICS AND LAW ARE (1) ETHICAL DEFICITS IN AREAS OF SOCIETY ON WHICH LAW (CO-)DEPENDS, (2) EXTREME AUTHORITARIAN AND TOTALITARIAN REGIMES, AND (3) AUTONOMOUS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAPABLE OF TURNING AWAY FROM HUMANS OR EVEN TURNING AGAINST AND OVERCOMING HUMANS. IN THE FIRST TWO CASES, THE HUMANENESS OF LAW IS CRITICALLY REDUCED OR EVEN EXTINGUISHED; IN THE LAST CASE, BOTH THE HUMANENESS AND THE HUMANITY OF LAW ARE EXTINGUISHED, WHICH IS THE WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIO. ALL THESE DANGERS MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN TIME AND ADEQUATELY AVERTED, AND REGULAR EFFORTS MUST BE MADE TO PRESERVE THE ETHICAL VALUES AND THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
314	OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS OF REFORM AND OPENING-UP, CHINA HAS GRADUALLY IMPLEMENTED A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH ESSENTIALLY GUARANTEES A NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIS SIGNIFICANT TRANSFORMATION OF THE REGIME UNDERLIES SOCIAL RELATIONS IN TODAY'S CHINA. CHINESE WORKERS' DEMANDS, WHETHER OVER WAGES, RESTRUCTURING PLANS, RELOCATIONS OR UNPAID OVERTIME, ARE FORMULATED IN A "LANGUAGE OF RIGHTS" THAT IS BASED ON A SET OF RULES AND LAWS KNOWN TO THE WORKERS. AT THE CENTRE OF THESE NEW AND COMPLEX DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF NEW RIGHTS AND THE ABSENCE OF A RULE OF LAW, TWO PHENOMENA DESERVE PARTICULAR ATTENTION: ON THE ONE HAND, THE EMERGENCE OF A SINICISED "PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION" SYSTEM, AND THE GRADUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ORIGINAL FORM OF COLLECTIVE NEGOTIATION ON THE OTHER. THE PRESENT ARTICLE ADDRESSES THESE TWO FORMS OF MOBILISATION BY REPLACING THEM IN THEIR CONTEXT: THE AUTHORITARIAN CHINESE STATE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO IMPLEMENT SOME REFORMS, YET IS NOT READY TO QUESTION THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF ITS EXISTENCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE ADVANCEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS OF CHINESE LAW APPEAR IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONTRADICTIONS AND HESITATIONS OF THE BEIJING REGIME.
315	NATIONS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE GLOBE HAVE BEEN BATTLING OVER COPYRIGHT PROTECTION LAWS, WITH INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS PRESSURING DEVELOPING NATIONS TO ADOPT "WESTERN-STYLE" COPYRIGHT REGIMES. THESE BATTLES ARE ESCALATING AS COPYRIGHT PIRACY GROWS, WHILE DEVELOPING NATIONS STRUGGLE TO FORMULATE REFORMS THAT WILL PROTECT THEIR OWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS WELL AS THAT OF INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS. CHINA IS AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF THESE DEBATES. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND MOST RECENTLY IN 2015, CHINA HAS RELEASED TRANSFORMATIVE NEW PROPOSALS TO REFORM ITS COPYRIGHT LAWS. THIS ARTICLE BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST SCHOLARLY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CHINA'S REFORMS CRITIQUES CHINA'S NEW PROPOSALS. MORE BROADLY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES CHINA'S COPYRIGHT REFORMS AS A CASE STUDY OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW IN EMERGING ECONOMIES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WESTERN GOVERNMENTS AND BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN MISGUIDED IN PRESSURING CHINA TO ADOPT OR TRANSPLANT WESTERN-STYLE COPYRIGHT LAWS. INSTEAD, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, FOR CHINA TO CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTIONS, CHINA SHOULD ADOPT A MORE RULES BASED APPROACH SIMILAR TO THE COPYRIGHT REGIMES OF JAPAN AND TAIWAN.
316	THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE (OHR) IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA HAS BEEN MANDATED TO GUARANTEE THAT FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE DAYTON PEACE AGREEMENT IS ACHIEVED, INCLUDING RESPECT FOR THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW AS A KEY CONDITION FOR LASTING PEACE. HOWEVER, THE POWER TO VET, DISMISS AND BAN PUBLIC OFFICIALS FROM PUBLIC LIFE AT THE OHR'S DISCRETION SEEMS TO BE EXERCISED IN INCREASING TENSION WITH SOME ESSENTIAL DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE UN PEACEKEEPING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, THIS ANOMALY COULD BE EXPLAINED BY THE NEED FOR SOME TRANSITIONAL EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. FURTHERMORE, EMERGENCY DEROGATIONS ARE USUALLY ALLOWED FOR IN ALL FUNCTIONING INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEMS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ABSENCE OF A PUBLIC AND THOROUGH REVISION OF THE HARSHNESS OF SOME DEROGATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THEIR CONNECTION TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES BEYOND THE STRICT DAYTON FRAMEWORK, RAISES SUSPICIONS ABOUT THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS AGAINST SUCH EXCEPTIONS REQUIRED BY THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEMS. AFTER 13 YEARS OF EXCEPTIONAL RULE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA (BIH), COULD THIS BE THE TIME FOR REVISION? THE ARTICLE OFFERS REFLECTIONS ON POSSIBLE LEGAL SCENARIOS.
317	THE PROBLEM OF THE HIDDEN EVIDENCE IN THE SPEED CONTROL, MAINLY THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE OBTAINED THROUGH INSIDIOUS MEANS, SURREPTITIOUS OR HIDDEN. THE COMPATIBILITY OF THIS QUESTION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND WITH THE RESPECT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
318	IN THE "NEW WORLD ORDER," SOMALIA IS CHARACTERIZED AS A DEVIANT SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY BY WESTERN COUNTRIES. THIS CHARACTERIZATION IS MAGNIFIED BY FOCUSING UPON ARMED CONFLICTS AMONG DIFFERENT GROUPS IN SOMALIA AND IS MARKED BY A NEGLECT OF GLOBAL FORCES AND HISTORY, INCLUDING INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVES. THE BENCHMARK FOR JUDGING THE NATURE AND SCALE OF SUCH CRISES IS THE CONDITION OF STATELESSNESS, MEASURED BY THE ABSENCE OF A CENTRAL POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND THE MODERN CLAIM OF AN OSTENSIBLE UNIVERSAL RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE ATTEMPTED REPLACEMENT OF SACRED PLACES AND KINSHIP IDENTITIES OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES WITH THE IDENTITY OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER THAT EMPHASIZES SELF-INTERESTED AND SELF-MAXIMIZING INDIVIDUALS, I.E., WESTERN INDIVIDUALISM, HAS LED NOT TO A MELTING POT, BUT A BOILING POT. THE SOMALIS, AS WITH MANY OTHER ETHNIC AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, DO NOT FIND A MEANINGFUL SENSE OF LIFE BY BEING DEFINED AS MODERN INDIVIDUALS VIA THE STATE. ANY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DISENTANGLING SOMALIA AND SIMILAR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES FROM CURRENT AND FUTURE CRISES MIGHT BENEFIT FROM RECOGNITION AND ACCOMODATION TO THEIR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF LIFE AND SYSTEMS OF GOVERNANCE. MOREOVER, FUTURE WORK SHOULD INCLUDE EXPLICATIONS OF THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL HEGEMONY, THE INCREASING ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN ADVANCING FOREIGN POLICY, MILITARY INTERVENTIONS UNDER THE FACADE OF PEACEKEEPING, AND THE ACCELERATION OF A MARKET ECONOMY OSTENSIBLY DIRECTED BY GLOBAL FORCES SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND.
319	THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION IN AFRICA AND FOCUSES ON THE EFFECT OF ICT DIFFUSION ON CORRUPTION. USING A SAMPLE OF 47 AFRICAN COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1996 TO 2014, EMPIRICAL FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF HIGH CORRUPTION INERTIA IN AFRICA AND SHOW THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS THE STRONGEST FACTOR DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION. RESULTS REVEAL THAT AFRICAN ECONOMIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THE ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFECTS OF ICT ADOPTION ONLY ONCE A THRESHOLD OF RULE OF LAW IS REACHED. THUS, POLICIES BASED ON THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND MOBILE PHONES ARE CORRUPTION EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING CORRUPTION IN AFRICA BUT NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED BY GREATER LAW BRIBERY ENFORCEMENT.
320	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CONFUCIAN AND WESTERN TRADITIONS SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE RELATION BETWEEN MORALITY, LAW AND GOOD ADMINISTRATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COMMON OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE RULE OF MAN AND THE RULE OF LAW AS REFLECTING THE BASIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TRADITIONS IS INADEQUATE. CONFUCIANISM CAN BE BETTER CHARACTERIZED POSITIVELY AS THE RULE OF MORALITY. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTICED THAT THE RULE OF LAW' IS INCREASINGLY BEING INTRODUCED INTO THE CHINESE ADMINISTRATION. SIMILARLY, EVEN THOUGH THE WESTERN TRADITION CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RULE OF MAN' CANNOT BE AVOIDED, AND THAT MORALITY IS IMPORTANT. BOTH TRADITIONS OPPOSE THE RULE OF MAN, IN AS FAR AS IT REFERS TO SOMEONE ACTING OUT HIS SELFISH PREFERENCES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT GOOD ADMINISTRATION REQUIRES OFFICIALS WITH BOTH GOOD MORALITY AND RESPECT FOR THE LAW; WHETHER THIS IS A KIND OF CONVERGENCE IS A MATTER OF DEBATE. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS THIS ARTICLE STUDIES CONFUCIAN AND WESTERN ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS IN RELATION TO THE NOTION OF GOOD ADMINISTRATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COMMON CHARACTERIZATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONFUCIAN TRADITION IN TERMS OF THE WESTERN REVILED RULE OF MAN' IS MISGUIDED. RATHER THAN UNDERSTANDING THE POSITIVE MORAL CONNOTATIONS OF THE CONFUCIAN GOOD ADMINISTRATOR IT ASSOCIATES THEM WITH A SPECIFIC NEGATIVE NOTION; AT THE SAME TIME, OVERSTRESSING THE WESTERN RULE OF LAW' MAY OBSCURE THE NEED FOR MORAL PERSONS FOR GOOD ADMINISTRATION.
321	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NEW DEMOCRACIES OF THE THIRD WAVE BY DEVELOPING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE CORE ELEMENTS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND BY CONSTRUCTING A NEW DATABASE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE. THE PERFORMANCE IS SHOWN TO BE UNEVEN IN TWO MAIN WAYS. FIRST, THE INSTITUTIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ADVANCE WHILE INDIVIDUAL AND MINORITY RIGHTS LANGUISH. SECOND, PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONAL ATTRIBUTES COEXIST UNCOMFORTABLY, AS DO PARTICULAR RIGHTS. A COMPARISON OF BRAZIL, COLOMBIA, AND GUATEMALA COMPLEMENTS THE BIG PICTURE DRAWN FROM THE DATABASE AND FOCUSES ON THE SPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN CREATE THE GENERAL POLITICAL CONTOUR, OF THE WAVE. THE UNEVEN DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE OF THESE CASES IS MAINLY EXPLAINED BY THE COMBINATION OF PERSISTENT OLIGARCHIC POWER AND A LARGELY UNACCOUNTABLE MILITARY. YET UNEVEN PERFORMANCE, AND THE IMPERFECT RULE OF LAW IN PARTICULAR, DOES NOT NECESSARILY PREVENT DEMOCRATIC SURVIVAL.
322	THIS REVIEW ARTICLE DRAWS OUT SOME OF THE MAJOR JURISPRUDENTIAL LESSONS THAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES OF JUDICIAL POLITICS IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES. SUCH REGIMES NEED TO PORTRAY THEMSELVES AS RESPECTFUL OF THE RULE OF LAW TO PROLONG THEIR GRIP ON POWER; THEY THEREFORE TOLERATE INDEPENDENT COURTS, BECAUSE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS EMBLEMATIC OF A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE REGIME MUST CONTEND WITH AN UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECT OF INDEPENDENT COURTS: JUDGES MAY USE THEIR INDEPENDENCE TO CHECK THE REGIME, LIMITING ITS POWER. AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WILL THUS EMPLOY STRATEGIES TO CONTAIN JUDICIAL POWER, PRODUCING A DIALECTIC OF EMPOWERMENT AND CONSTRAINT WITH RESPECT TO COURTS. AMONG THE LESSONS HIGHLIGHTED IS THAT ATTEMPTS BY AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO CONTAIN COURTS STRAIN FORMAL RULE OF LAW CONDITIONS (CONDITIONS REQUIRING, INTER ALIA, THAT LAWS COMPRISE RULES THAT ARE CLEAR, NON-CONTRADICTORY, STABLE, AND GENERALLY PROSPECTIVE, AND THAT OFFICIAL ACTION MATCH DECLARED RULE), SUGGESTING THAT THE FORMAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IMPOSES SUBSTANTIVE LIMITS ON ARBITRARY POWER; AND THAT THE DIALECTIC OF EMPOWERMENT AND CONSTRAINT EXHIBITS A PROBLEM OF DOMINATION WITH RESPECT TO COURTS, AS PART OF A LARGER PROBLEM OF DOMINATION OF LEGAL SUBJECTS.
323	THE JURIDICAL STRUCTURE INVOLVES THE CHOICE OF A LEGAL MODEL FORMED BY ABSTRACTION, OR IDEALIZATION, OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROJECT. THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY THE CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF THE MANY-SIDED CRITICISM OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. METHODOLOGY: A CONCRETE HISTORICAL METHOD WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE VARIETY OF CRITICISM OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW FROM KARL MARX TO THE PRESENT, EXCLUDING THE CONCEPT OF DENIAL OF LAW. RESULTS: UNLIKE CRITICISM BY MARX AND MANNHEIM OF LAW IN TERMS OF IDEOLOGY, CONTEMPORARY THEORISTS CRITICIZE THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW FROM THEIR OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL POSITIONS SUCH AS IGNORING THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC SOCIO-CULTURAL CONDITIONS THAT GENERATE SPECIAL LEGAL NORMS AND RELATIONS, IS OFTEN EXPLOITED TO POSITION THESE NORMS AND RELATIONS AS NATURAL AND UNIVERSAL. IN THE OPPOSITE CASE, THE EXISTENCE OF UNIVERSAL LEGAL KNOWLEDGE (EPISTEMIC RELATIVISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATIVITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF LEGAL FACTS) AND UNIVERSALLY VALID LEGAL NORMS (MORAL AND LEGAL RELATIVISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATIVITY OF THE MEANINGS OF LEGAL IDEAS, CONCEPTS AND NORMS) IS DENIED, SINCE IDEAS AND VALUES ALWAYS DEPEND ON THE VIEWS OF COGNITIVE OR MORAL SUBJECT. CONCLUSION: WHILE MODERN LAW AND SOCIETY NEED MULTIDIMENSIONAL CRITICISM FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, THEN THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES PROTECTION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF LAW.
324	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE LANGUAGE OF EU LEADERS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EU ASYLUM LAW BY TRIGGERING DEROGATIONS, EXCEPTIONS AND AMENDMENTS. IT COMPARES THIS PROCESS WITH REGARDS TO THE 2015 REFUGEE CRISIS, THE BELARUS BORDER CRISIS AND THE CURRENT UKRAINIAN CRISIS TO PORTRAY HOW THE REACTION TO SIMILAR FACTS DIFFERS AND, HENCE, TO SHOW HOW EU ASYLUM POLICY SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF RULE OF LAW. AS THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE UNFOLDS, ONE CAN OBSERVE HOW STRONGLY THE NARRATIVE OF EU LEADERS DIFFERS REGARDING THESE REFUGEES COMPARED TO THOSE FROM, E.G., SYRIA AND AFGHANISTAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. IT SHOWS A "U-TURN" OF THE EU'S AGENDA SINCE 2015. HENCE, IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT THE PROBLEM LIES LESS IN SUFFICIENT CONTINGENCIES FOR A SUDDEN INFLUX, BUT RATHER A FEELING - OR LACK - OF SOLIDARITY. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASYLUM APPLICANTS BASED ON THEIR NATIONALITY. TO THE CONTRARY, REFUGEE PROTECTION BUILDS ON THE PROHIBITION OF DISCRIMINATION. THIS HAS POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU. HENCE, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW EU LEADERS "TALK" THEIR WAY INTO APPLYING OR NOT APPLYING EU LAW AND EVEN CREATE EU LAW AT THEIR WILL SIMPLY BY DESCRIBING THE ARRIVALS AS A SECURITY THREAT, A "HYBRID ATTACK" OR INSTEAD AS NEIGHBORS IN NEED, AS "FAMILY".
325	MAINSTREAM DISCOURSES TEND TO TREAT LAND DISPOSSESSION AS A 'DEVELOPING' COUNTRY PROBLEM THAT ARISES DUE TO WEAK/CORRUPT LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INADEQUATE PROPERTY INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE UNSETTLES SUCH DISCOURSES BY EXAMINING EXPROPRIATIONS FOR ECONOMIC 'DEVELOPMENT' IN THE UNITED STATES-A COUNTRY TYPICALLY DEEMED TO HAVE STRONG PROPERTY INSTITUTIONS AND A STRONG RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON VARIOUS EXAMPLES, I PROPOSE THAT EXPROPRIATION IN THE US IS NEITHER RIGOROUSLY CONDITIONAL NOR PARTICULARLY EXCEPTIONAL. WHILE MOST 'TAKINGS' LAWS ARE SUPPOSED TO RESTRICT THE STATE'S POWER, THIS RESTRICTION HINGES ON THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC USE, PURPOSE, NECESSITY, OR INTEREST. AND IN MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE US, THESE CONCEPTS ARE NOW DEFINED BROADLY AND VAGUELY SO AS TO INCLUDE PRIVATE FOR-PROFIT PROJECTS. ULTIMATELY, THE CONTENTS, INTERPRETATION, AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW ARE SUBJECT TO SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUGGLES; THIS POINT IS HABITUALLY OVERLOOKED IN THE RULE OF LAW 'SOLUTIONS' TO LAND GRABBING-. FOR THESE REASONS, TITLING/REGISTRATION PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, ARE LIKELY TO TRANSFORM RATHER THAN 'SOLVE' DISPOSSESSION IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
326	MANY STUDIES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED A SUBSTANTIAL "BUREAUCRACY DOMINATION" IN PROCEDURES RELATING TO MIGRANTS' ACCESS TO TERRITORY. THIS FORM OF DOMINATION IS MARKED BY HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY AND ARBITRARY PRACTICES, ENACTED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES OF THE STATE. ONLY MINOR ATTENTION, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO THE ARBITRARINESS OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND TO THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN GENERAL IN THE NUMEROUS PROCEEDINGS THAT INCREASINGLY AFFECT THE PATH OF MIGRANTS. THIS PATH IS THE MAIN OBJECT OF THIS PAPER. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON ITALIAN CASE LAW IN EXPULSION AND DETENTION PROCEEDINGS OF IRREGULAR THIRD COUNTRY NATIONAL CITIZENS AND ASYLUM SEEKERS AND PRESENTS QUALITATIVE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON DECISIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPETENT NATIONAL AUTHORITIES. THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN ANALYSED USING A SELECTION OF THEORETICAL TOOLS, ALL REFERABLE TO THE GENERAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE JUDICIAL DECISIONS ON PRE-REMOVAL DETENTION PROCEEDINGS IN TWO CASE STUDIES ARE EXAMINED: THE JURISPRUDENCE ON DETENTION OF IRREGULAR MIGRANTS, IN DIFFERENT OFFICES OF THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IN ITALY; AND THE CASE LAW ON DETENTION OF ASYLUM SEEKERS IN THE ORDINARY TRIBUNAL OF ROME. THE ASSUMPTION UNDERLYING THE RESEARCH IS THAT VARIOUS CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW MAY HAVE DIFFERENT EXPLANATORY POWER WHEN IT COMES TO EXPLAINING THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS. TO VERIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS, THE STUDY PROPOSES AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAIN RULE OF LAW DOCTRINES IN THE WESTERN TRADITION OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL THOUGHT AND APPLIES THE METHOD OF HISTORICAL-CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF SIX THEORETICAL MODELS OF THE RULE OF LAW WAS VERIFIED AGAINST THE DATA WITH THE VIEW TO HIGHLIGHT THE VIRTUES AND VICES OF THE RESPECTIVE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORKS. THIS ARTICLE REACHES A TWO-FOLD CONCLUSION. FIRST, AS FAR AS THE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORKS ARE CONCERNED: THE RESULTS OF THE TWO CASE STUDIES CANNOT BE FULLY EXPLAINED BY ANY OF THE MODELS CONSIDERED IN THIS STUDY. THIS FACT ALONE CASTS DOUBTS ON THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF THESE THEORIES AND CALLS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING MORE GENERALLY. SECONDLY, A KEY FINDING OF THE STUDY REGARDING THE NOTIONS OF DISCRETION AND ARBITRARINESS IS THAT THE JUDICIAL APPROACH WHICH ASSURES THE HIGHEST PROTECTION OF RIGHTS IS ALSO THE ONE THAT IS MOST EASILY INFLUENCED BY ARBITRARINESS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THIS PARADOX CAN BE EASILY DISSOLVED BY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PLURAL DIMENSIONS OF ARBITRARINESS. IF WE CONSIDER ARBITRARINESS FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, I.E. AS AN ILLEGAL DECISION, IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT THE AUTHORITY THAT MOST USES ITS DISCRETIONARY POWERS IS ALSO THE ONE MOST AT RISK OF ABUSING THESE DISCRETIONARY POWERS AND HENCE OF EXERCISING ARBITRARY POWER. HOWEVER, IF WE CONSIDER ARBITRARINESS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PHILOSOPHICAL-POLITICAL THEORY, I.E. AS A FORM OF DOMINATION CHARACTERISED BY THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION, IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT THE JUDICIAL APPROACH WHICH ASSURES THE HIGHEST PROTECTION OF RIGHTS IS ALSO THE ONE THAT TAKES ITS OWN ROLE AS GUARANTOR OF THESE RIGHTS AND OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC LEGAL ORDER AS SUCH MOST SERIOUSLY. THIS JUDICIAL APPROACH THUS MOST OFTEN RISKS EXERCISING ITS POWER IN CRITICISABLE WAYS, AS COMPARED TO AN AUTHORITY MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
327	FOOTBALL (SOCCER) PROVIDES A USEFUL PRISM FOR ANALYSIS OF THE LONG TRANSITION OF THE SERBIAN STATE AND SOCIETY SINCE 1991. TO A STRIKING EXTENT, THE WORLD OF PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL AND THE ATTENDANT PHENOMENA OF FINANCIAL CORRUPTION AND FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM HAVE INFORMED BOTH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND THE CURRENT CONCERTED ATTEMPT TO CREATE A "EUROPEAN SERBIA." DURING THE 1990S, FOOTBALL IN SERBIA TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE CRIMINALIZATION OF THE SERBIAN STATE. SINCE 2000, THE PERSISTENT PHENOMENA OF CRIME, VIOLENT HOOLIGANISM AND LETHARGIC REFORMS HAVE MIRRORED THE DIFFICULT AND HALTING TRANSITION OF THE POST- MILOSEVIC STATE. ALTHOUGH RECENT EVENTS HIGHLIGHT THE RELUCTANCE OF THE SERBIAN AUTHORITIES TO CONFRONT THESE PROBLEMS, BOTH GOVERNMENT AND SPORTS OFFICIALS ARE COMING TO SEE REFORM OF SERBIAN FOOTBALL AS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
328	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INDIVIDUALIZATION OF PUNISHMENT AND THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE BETWEEN THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THE PREVENTIVE AND REHABILITATIVE PURPOSES OF THE CRIMINOLOGICAL SCIENCE WERE SHARED ON BOTH SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC, BUT WERE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED IN DIFFERENT MANNERS, DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENT LEGAL ORDER SHAPED BY THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW AND THE EUROPEAN RECHTSSTAAT. WHILE THE U.S. SYSTEM ACCEPTED THE INDETERMINATE PUNISHMENT INTRODUCING A CLEAR-CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE VERDICT AND THE SENTENCE, AS A COMPROMISE NOT TO NULL IFY THE NULLUM CRIMEN PRINCIPLE BY INDIVIDUALIZING THE TREATMENT OF THE GUILTY OFFENDER, THE EUROPEAN PENAL CODES BASED ON A STRICT LEGALITY INTRODUCED THE DUAL-TRACK SYSTEM AS A WAY TO RECONCILE REPRESSION AND PREVENTION. BOTH THE BIPHASIC TRIAL AND THE SECURITY MEASURES AFFECTED THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND GAVE THE BALANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL SAFEGUARDS AND SOCIAL SECURITY NEW CHARACTERISTICS, SHOWING THE POSSIBILITY TO MOULD THE RULE OF LAW ACCORDING TO THE HISTORICAL, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT.
329	ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW IS ESTABLISHED AS AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARD, THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE CONCEPT HAVE VIRTUALLY DISAPPEARED, TO THE POINT WHEREBY THE RULE OF LAW IS NOW OFTEN CONCEIVED OF AS SOMETHING NEUTRAL, MEASURABLE BY VARIOUS INDICATORS. HOWEVER, BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW ASSUMES A CERTAIN TYPE OF STATE AND A CERTAIN CONCEPTION OF THE LAW, PARTICULARLY ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE. THESE INCONVENIENT TRUTHS WERE RAISED IN A SURVEY CONDUCTED AMONG SEVERAL HUNDRED DEFENDANTS IN THE IVORY COAST. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS DISCONNECTED FROM SOCIETAL REPRESENTATION, PRACTICAL NORMS, AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION THAT IS CRUCIAL TO ITS VERY EXISTENCE. THROUGH AN ACTION-RESEARCH APPROACH, A MIXED METHODS ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY'S QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA SHOWS THAT DESPITE THE CONTEMPORARY REVISION OF NORMS, THERE IS NO SYSTEMATIC RE-EVALUATION OF PRETRIAL DETENTION. FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AIMS TO IMPOSE OF STANDARDS WHICH ARE DISCONNECTED FROM ENDOGENOUS NOTIONS OF LAW AND JUSTICE, WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE LOCAL REALITIES OF MEDIATION PROCESSES. THE FOCUS ON PRETRIAL DETENTION HIGHLIGHTS THE PARADOXICAL NATURE OF A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM PROCESS THAT IS TOTALLY DISSOCIATED FROM ITS ADMINISTRATIVE FOUNDATIONS.
330	MAGNA CARTA'S STATUS AS A TOUCHSTONE OF MODERN THINKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW RESTS ON SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN MYTHS. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE INFLUENCE OF MAGNA CARTA ON MODERN CONSTITUTIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF FORMATION AS WELL AS CONTENT. THE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT MAGNA CARTA'S RELEVANCE IS, IF ANYTHING, ON THE RISE, EVEN IF THE CAUSAL CHAINS LINKING IT TO CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS ARE WEAK-LINKED AND DISTANT. WE SPECULATE ON THE MYSTERIOUS PROCESSES THAT PRODUCE INFLUENCE AMONG LEGAL TEXTS, ARGUING THAT CHAMPIONS AND EMPIRE ARE CRUCIAL FACTORS IN THE CASE OF MAGNA CARTA. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC.

331	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES. WE OF STRUCTURAL REFORM, COMPRISING MARKETIZATION, RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRATIZATION THE EXTENT OF CORRUPTION CONTROL IN FORMER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER FOUND THAT THE PROGRESS HAD A CRUCIAL IMPACT ON B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
332	ALMOST ALL LATIN AMERICAN STATES HAVE EMBARKED UPON SIGNIFICANT LEGAL REFORM THAT PROPOSES THE "RULE OF LAW" AS A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEMS OF THE PAST AND FOR THEIR "REDEMOCRATIZATION". THE CRITIQUE OF LAW BY THE FRENCH SOCIOLOGIST PIERRE BOURDIEU COULD EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT, DESPITE SEVERAL LEGAL REFORMS, THE REGION IS STILL KNOWN FOR ITS "INEQUALITIES". POVERTY AND GROWING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF VULNERABILITY IN LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACIES, WHICH CHALLENGE THE STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THE BOURDIEUSIAN CRITIQUE, THE RULE OF LAW CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INEQUALITY AND, IRONICALLY, CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE STARTING POINT FOR SOLUTIONS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE CRITICISM OF PIERRE BOURDIEU LEADS TO A THEORY OF LAW THAT SERVES AS A REAL TOOL FOR SOCIAL CHANGE.
333	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES CONTEMPORARY TRENDS IN THE DEPORTATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS, FOCUSING ON THE PAST AND PRESENT SITUATION OF THE CENTRES DE RETENTION ADMINISTRATIVE, FRENCH CONFINEMENT FACILITIES WHERE DEPORTEES AWAIT THEIR REMOVAL. STUDYING THE DIFFERENTIAL ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION, WE ARGUE THAT THE 'RULE OF LAW', THOUGH INTEGRATED WITH THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OF DEPORTATION, HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A WAY TO MORE EASILY 'GOVERN' THE DEPORTED POPULATION.
334	TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER THE EUROPEAN UNION IDENTIFIED HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AS A TOP ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED IN BULGARIA, THE COUNTRY REMAINS THE MOST CORRUPT MEMBER STATE. THIS ARTICLE ASKS WHY DESPITE STRONG CONDITIONALITY BEFORE ACCESSION IN 2007 AND A SPECIALLY TAILORED COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM (CVM), THE EU HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN EFFECTIVELY ASSISTING MANAGEMENT OF CORRUPTION IN BULGARIA. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE CVM AND ARGUES THAT SINCE BULGARIA'S ACCESSION IN 2007, EXTERNAL PRESSURE FROM THE EU IS A NECESSARY BUT INSUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR CHANGE. THE EU NEEDS CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS (CSOS) TO BE AN EMPOWERED AND TRUSTWORTHY DOMESTIC PARTNER, IN ORDER FOR THE CVM TO ACHIEVE THE RULE OF LAW IN BULGARIA. THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT THE EU HAS SET ITSELF UP FOR FAILURE EVEN BEFORE IT ESTABLISHED THE CVM, BECAUSE IT DID NOT NOURISH AN DOMESTICALLY ACTIVE, STRONG AND PRO-EU CSOS.
335	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES VARIOUS APPROACHES TO THE PURPOSES OF STATE CONTROL. THE AUTHOR COMES TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF THE THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF STATE CONTROL: THE RULE OF LAW, ENSURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES, AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. WITH RESPECT TO INTERNAL CONTROL, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE GOALS HAS FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIENTATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION.
336	PEACE IS CONCEIVABLE ONLY AS A LEGAL ORDER. ACCORDING TO HANS KELSEN, A LEGAL ORDER IS BY ITS VERY NATURE A 'COERCIVE ORDER'. THUS, PEACE AND COERCION ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, BUT REFER TO EACH OTHER IN THE CONCEPT OF LAW. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, WE ELABORATE AND PROBLEMATIZE THE PARADOXICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COERCION AND PEACE IN THEORETICAL AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. FOR THIS, WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ARBITRARY FORCE AND LEGAL ENFORCEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF WORLD-ORDER POLITICS. WHILE WE ARGUE IN FAVOR OF PEACE THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE ALSO EMPHASIZE THE ELEMENT OF ARBITRARINESS IN THE CONCEPT AND HISTORICAL FORMATION OF LAW. THIS IS TO SAY THAT THE STABILIZATION OF PEACE THROUGH LEGAL COERCION GOES HAND IN HAND WITH ITS SIMULTANEOUS DESTABILIZATION. THE TEXT UNFOLDS THIS DILEMMA WITH REFERENCE TO THE EVOLUTION OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF LEGITIMIZING THE USE OF FORCE FROM PAST TO PRESENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE DILEMMA CANNOT BE OVERCOME, BUT IT CAN BE MITIGATED THROUGH THE CREATION OF A RULE OF LAW, WHICH ALLOWS FOR A REFLEXIVE TREATMENT OF THE TENSION BETWEEN PEACE AND COERCION.
337	THE WESTERN BALKANS EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES FACE RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN HUNGARY OR POLAND DID AT THE TIME OF THEIR ACCESSIONS IN 2004. DESPITE EXTENSIVE EU CONDITIONALITY AND SUPPORT, WITH 16% OF EU PRE-STRUCTURAL FUNDS DEDICATED BETWEEN 2014 AND 2020 TO RULE OF LAW PROJECTS, GOVERNANCE INDICATORS SHOW NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS (ECA) ALSO FOUND LITTLE IMPACT IN ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CANDIDATE COUNTRIES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, HOWEVER, DOES REPORT SIGNS OF PROGRESS. BY DRAWING ON PUBLIC PROCUREMENT DATA FROM THE TWO SECTORS CONCENTRATING MOST PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, NAMELY HEALTH AND CONSTRUCTION, BETWEEN THE YEARS 2017 AND 2019, THIS PAPER SOLVES THE DILEMMA OF HOW ALLEGEDLY SUCCESSFUL REFORMS CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT MUCH IMPACT. BY DIRECTLY MEASURING GOVERNMENT FAVOURITISM IN PROCUREMENT, BEFORE AND AFTER EU-DRIVEN REFORMS, THE PAPER FINDS THAT EVOLUTION HAS SO FAR BEEN LIMITED DESPITE PROVING THE EFFECT OF CERTAIN INTERVENTIONS. THE PARADOX IS EXPLAINED BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF VERSATILE BEHAVIOUR BY THE MAIN RENT OWNERS AND THE INCREASING DISCRETIONARY POWER OF ALBANIA'S GOVERNING PARTY.
338	ATTEMPTED SECESSIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, KOSOVO AND SOMALILAND) AND COUPS D'ETAT (FOR EXAMPLE, MADAGASCAR AND HONDURAS IN 2009) PROMPT CONTESTATION OVER WHETHER OR NOT LEGAL STATUS IS TO BE CONFERRED ON LOCAL EXERCISES OF DE FACTO AUTHORITY. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDING HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN ESTABLISHED BY VICTORY IN A TRIAL BY ORDEAL: A REGION INITIALLY INTEGRAL TO AN EXISTING STATE SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHES ITSELF AS AN INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGN UNIT ONLY WHERE ITS SECESSION MOVEMENT CREATES -USUALLY BY DECISIVE VICTORY IN AN ARMED STRUGGLE - FACTS ON THE GROUND THAT APPEAR IRREVERSIBLE; AN INSURGENT FACTION SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHES ITSELF AS A GOVERNMENT WHERE IT OVERTHROWS AN EXISTING CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND SECURES - EVEN IF AT BAYONET-POINT - WIDESPREAD POPULAR ACQUIESCENCE. INSOFAR AS IT IS PERCEIVED AS LITTLE MORE THAN AN IMPRIMATUR FOR 'MIGHT MAKES RIGHT' AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, THIS 'EFFECTIVE CONTROL DOCTRINE' IS MANIFESTLY OFFENSIVE TO A RULE-OF-LAW SENSIBILITY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER'S DISPOSITION TO DEFER TO THE OUTCOME OF INTERNAL CONFLICTS, ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS ARE AVAILABLE WHERE A STATE MANIFESTLY FAILS TO EMBODY THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE ENTIRETY OF THE TERRITORIAL POPULATION, OR WHERE A GOVERNMENT MANIFESTLY FAILS TO REPRESENT THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY THAT THE STATE ENCOMPASSES. THESE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS, HOWEVER, FAR FROM GENERATING NEW GENERALLY APPLICABLE DOCTRINES, TEND INELUCTABLY TO HAVE AN AD HOC CHARACTER.
339	COMPELLING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON WHETHER INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) IS SYSTEMATICALLY BIASED AGAINST POOR RESPONDENT STATES HARDLY EXISTS. WE FOCUS ON DISENTANGLING THE EFFECTS OF THE RESPONDENT STATE'S PER-CAPITA INCOME AND THE STRENGTH OF DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW ON ISDS OUTCOMES. WE FIND THAT BOTH HIGHER INCOME AND STRONGER THAN 'NORMAL' RULE OF LAW REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF INVESTOR WINS IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES.
340	HOW DID THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW BECOME STUNTED IN SICILY DURING THE 19(TH) CENTURY? THE WORK OF ECONOMIST YORAM BARZEL, PARTICULARLY HIS PROPERTY-RIGHTS APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF STATE FORMATION, IS UNIQUELY SUITED TO UNDERSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ITALY'S UNIFICATION PROCESS TO SECURE THE RULE OF LAW IN SICILY DURING THE 19TH CENTURY. THIS FAILURE CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A LACK OF A CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE STATE FORMATION PROCESS. I ARGUE THAT THIS LACK OF CREDIBLE COMMITMENT MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ABOLITION OF PREVIOUSLY EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY INSTITUTIONS AS AN INDEPENDENT COLLECTIVE ACTION MECHANISM, AS WELL AS PRIOR CONSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENTS THAT EXISTED IN THE KINGDOM OF SICILY. THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY OVER THE SECURITY AND LEGAL DEFINITION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OVER LAND RAISED THE TRANSACTION COSTS OF COMPETING FOR RESOURCES THROUGH PRODUCTIVE SPECIALIZATION AND MARKET EXCHANGE. IN TURN, IT REDUCED THE RELATIVE COSTS OF COMPETITION FOR LAND OWNERSHIP AND THE USE OF ENFORCEMENT THROUGH OTHER MEANS, SUCH AS RENT SEEKING OR ORGANIZED CRIME.
341	LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FORM A PART OF THE REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, AND RESPONDING TO SUCH LAWSUITS CONSTITUTES AN UNAVOIDABLE PART OF GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, IN THE CONTEXT OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION HAS BEEN VIEWED AS A DISTINCTIVELY VALUABLE INSTITUTION FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. MOREOVER, THE JUDICIARY IS PORTRAYED AS THE KEYSTONE TO THIS INSTITUTION AND TO THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL: THE MORE POWERFUL AND COMPETENT IS THE JUDICIARY, THE MORE IT IS ABLE TO "CONSTRAIN GOVERNMENT" THROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW. THROUGH EMPIRICAL AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF OVER TWO DECADES OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION IN CHINA AGAINST ONE OF THE STATE'S ESSENTIAL BRANCHES, TAX COLLECTION, I CHALLENGE THE UTILITY OF THIS NORMATIVE CONCEPTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION. USING CONCEPTUAL TOOLS THAT APPLY ACROSS LEGAL SYSTEMS AND REGULATORY AREAS, I SHOW THAT WHILE LITIGANT BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT OFFER USEFUL EXPLANATIONS OF LITIGATION PATTERNS SUCH AS CASE VOLUME AND THE PLAINTIFF WIN RATE, THE RELEVANCE OF JUDICIAL QUALITY IS BARELY DISCERNIBLE. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE INTUITIVE IDEA THAT JUDICIAL REVIEW CAN OPERATE ONLY WHEN A PRIVATE PARTY BRINGS SUIT, AND WHETHER AND WHEN THEY WILL DO SO CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE RULE OF LAW MAY FAIL IN CERTAIN BASIC WAYS THAT EVEN A COMPETENT AND WELL-SUBSIDIZED JUDICIARY CANNOT REMEDY.
342	DESPITE DECADES OF RESEARCH ON HOW, WHY, AND WHEN COMPANIES MANAGE EARNINGS, THERE IS A PAUCITY OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF EARNINGS MANAGEMENT WITHIN MULTINATIONAL FIRMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE WHERE COMPANIES MANAGE EARNINGS USING A SAMPLE OF 2,067 U.S. MULTINATIONAL FIRMS FROM 1994 TO 2009. WE PREDICT AND FIND THAT FIRMS WITH EXTENSIVE FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES HAVE MORE FOREIGN EARNINGS MANAGEMENT THAN COMPANIES WITH SUBSIDIARIES IN LOCATIONS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS STRONG. WE ALSO FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT PROFITABLE FIRMS WITH EXTENSIVE TAX HAVEN SUBSIDIARIES MANAGE EARNINGS MORE THAN OTHER FIRMS AND THAT THE EARNINGS MANAGEMENT IS CONCENTRATED IN FOREIGN INCOME. APART FROM THESE RESULTS, WE FIND THAT MOST EARNINGS MANAGEMENT TAKES PLACE IN DOMESTIC INCOME, NOT FOREIGN INCOME.
343	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE JBS BUSINESS GROUP THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2017. IN ADDITION, AN EXPOSITION OF THE CONCEPT OF DENUNCIATION IN HISTORY AND IN THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM IS MADE WITH A FOCUS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE RESEARCH IS OF A QUALITATIVE NATURE AND ITS CORPUS INVOLVES DIVERSE BIBLIOGRAPHY, PRECAUTIONARY ACTIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC MINISTRY OF BRAZIL. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THE DENUNCIATION OF THE JBS BUSINESS GROUP ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY THE INTENSE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION IN WHICH BRAZILIAN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE INVOLVED. IT ALSO EXPOSES THAT POLITICIANS AND HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN BRAZIL EVADE THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES OF GOOD PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND SEEK PRIVATE BENEFITS IN A PROCESS OF LEGITIMIZING CORRUPTION, WHICH RESULTS IN A CORROSIVE THREAT AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAW.
344	CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE TRANSATLANTIC TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (TTIP) FOR THE ARCHITECTURE OF GLOBAL (ECONOMIC) GOVERNANCE, INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES SOME OF THE MOST PERTINENT SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCES TTIP IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE, BASED ON THE SHAPE THE AGREEMENT IS CURRENTLY TAKING. THE ARTICLE'S MAIN ARGUMENTS ARE THAT DESPITE REPRESENTING INNOVATION AND ADDED VALUE IN SOME AREAS, TTIP MAY PRODUCE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IN AT LEAST THREE RESPECTS. FIRSTLY, IT WILL CATER TO AN IMBALANCE IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE AREA OF INVESTMENT PROTECTION; SECONDLY, BY PROVIDING A WAY OUT FOR THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION'S (WTO) TWO MOST ACTIVE LITIGANTS, IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE DE-JUDICIALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW; AND THIRDLY, IT CREATES POTENTIAL FOR A FIERCE BACKLASH FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD AS REGARDS THE GLOBAL PROMOTION OF AN OVERTLY TRANSATLANTIC REGULATORY AND NORMATIVE AGENDA.
345	TO CONTEXTUALIZE PEACE AS AN OBJECTIVE OF 'SOCIAL RULE OF LAW', IT'S NECESSARY TO START BY UNDERSTANDING IT AS A PATH THAT GOES BEYOND ABANDONING WEAPONS AND ENDING CONFLICT. THIS IS A PATH THAT IS CONSTANTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY SOCIETY AND ITS INSTITUTIONS, THIS PATH HAS ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE, SUCH AS: DEMOCRACY, PARTICIPATION, CITIZENSHIP AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC POLICIES ORIENTED TO AN INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY, WHERE THE POINT OF DEPARTURE IS THE INDIVIDUAL, THE COLLECTIVE AND THE ENVIRONMENT; NOT EXCLUSIVELY FROM THE ECONOMIC. THEREFORE IT'S NECESSARY TO CONTEXTUALIZE, IN A GENERAL OVERVIEW, SOME OTHER ELEMENTS TO PREPARE THE WAYS TO CONSTRUCT PEACE.
346	THE PAPER ANALYSES HOW CORRUPTION AFFECTS THE RULE OF LAW IN SLOVENIAN LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENTS THROUGH QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF CORRUPTION CASES AND INTERVIEWS. WE DISCOVERED THAT CORRUPTION, ITS INFLUENCE ON LOCAL SOCIETY IS INCREASING, WHERE EVERYONE (ESPECIALLY MAYORS) ATTEMPTS TO AVOID OBLIGATIONS AND FIND LOOPHOLES INTO THE LAW IN ORDER TO BENEFIT. THERE IS A COMMON BELIEF THAT ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR AND NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THE RULE OF LAW IS DUE TO HUMAN GREED AND THE ROLE OF INFORMAL NETWORKS. THE MAIN CONSEQUENCES ARE INCREASING LEVELS OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS, MISTRUST IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, INEQUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION.
347	OVER THE LAST DECADE, A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF DEMOCRACY HAVE SOUGHT TO DEVELOP MEANS OF FRAMING AND ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND IDENTIFYING WAYS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE REVIEW THE RECENT EFFORTS TO CONCEPTUALIZE AND MEASURE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY BY WAY OF INTRODUCING A COMPREHENSIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING SOME ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. NEXT, WE PRESENT AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN BASED ON THE SUB-DIMENSIONS FORMULATED BY MORLINO - SPECIFICALLY, RULE OF LAW, ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, COMPETITION, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, AND RESPONSIVENESS. WE FIND THAT IN THE AREAS OF ACCOUNTABILITY, PARTICIPATION, AND FREEDOM, TAIWAN HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS. HOWEVER, TAIWAN'S YOUNG DEMOCRACY STILL HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREAS OF THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY, AND RESPONSIVENESS.
348	INDONESIA IS AN EMERGING POWER, BUT ONE PROBLEM PARTICULAR TAINTS THE SUCCESS STORY: CORRUPTION. WHILE CORRUPTION AFFECTS ALL PUBLIC POLICIES, ITS DISASTROUS EFFECTS ARE MOST VISIBLE IN FORESTRY. INDONESIA IS STILL HOME TO THE THIRD LARGEST RAINFORESTS IN THE WORLD, BUT THE COUNTRY IS LOSING ITS FORESTS FAST. ONE MAIN DRIVER OF DEFORESTATION IS ILLEGAL LOGGING. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THEREFORE A KEY TO STOP OR AT LEAST TO SLOW DOWN INDONESIA'S DEFORESTATION RATE. THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN KEEN TO SUPPORT THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT IN ITS FIGHT AGAINST ILLEGAL LOGGING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EUROPEAN FOREST LAW ENFORCEMENT GOVERNANCE AND TRADE POLICY (FLEGT). IN SEPTEMBER 2013, BRUSSELS AND JAKARTA HAVE SIGNED A FLEGT VOLUNTARY PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (A FELGT-VPA, MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS "TIMBER PACT"). UNDER THE TIMBER PACT, JAKARTA PROMISES AN OVERHAUL OF ITS FOREST GOVERNANCE. THIS REFORM OF FOREST GOVERNANCE IS COSTLY TO THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT, IN FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL TERMS. AFTER ALL, MANY ACTORS PROFITED FROM THE OLD SYSTEM. THE QUESTION ARISES WHY THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO THE TIMBER PACT. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ANALYSIS, A RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE IS TAKEN TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, FOCUSING ON THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL GAINS FOR THE DECISION-MAKERS. THE SECOND PART LOOKS AT THE ISSUE FROM A CONSTRUCTIVIST ANGLE AND SHOWS HOW THE NORM "FIGHT ILLEGAL LOGGING" FITTED INTO THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK OF INDONESIAN POLITICS. BY COMBINING A RATIONALIST AND A CONSTRUCTIVIST PERSPECTIVE, A BROAD PICTURE OF SUCCESSFUL EU NORM DIFFUSION IS PAINTED.
349	BY THE MID-FIRST CENTURY BC, QUAESTIONES PERPETUAE (STANDING COURTS) WERE THE PRINCIPAL TRIBUNALS BEFORE WHICH CHARGES OF OFFENCES AGAINST THE ROMAN RES PUBLICA WERE TRIED. THE EXTANT WRITINGS OF THE ROMAN STATESMAN AND ORATOR M. TULLIUS CICERO ARE OUR MAIN SOURCE AS TO THE ARGUMENTS WHICH WERE DEPLOYED BEFORE THESE COURTS AS BEING RELEVANT TO THEIR DETERMINATION OF THE CHARGES PRESENTED TO THEM. CASES OF MAIESTAS (TREASON) SOMETIMES RAISED QUESTIONS OF LAW AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG DIFFERENT ORGANS OF THE RES PUBLICA, BUT CICERO ARGUED THAT SUCH CASES ALSO REQUIRED THE COURTS TO DECIDE WHETHER DEFENDANTS HAD ACTED AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE RES PUBLICA BY REFERENCE TO SUBSTANTIVE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. CICERO APPEARS ALSO TO HAVE ARGUED THAT WIDE PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN RELATION TO OTHER OFFENCES TRIED BEFORE THE QUAESTIONES PERPETUAE. THE COURTS' WILLINGNESS TO ENTERTAIN SUCH ARGUMENTS DETRACTED FROM THE CLARITY OF THE RULES THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO APPLY, AND ALTERED THE NATURE OF THEIR OWN FUNCTION, AS TRIALS WERE POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMED INTO ARENAS OF POLITICAL JUDGMENT. IN CONSEQUENCE, THE QUAESTIONES PERPETUAE DID NOT OPERATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. RECOGNITION OF THESE FEATURES OF THE QUAESTIONES PERPETUAE MAY ASSIST IN EXPLAINING WHY THESE COURTS WERE OF QUESTIONABLE LEGITIMACY, WERE INEFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE CONSTRAINT ON THE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER, AND FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE WHICH L. CORNELIUS SULLA MAY HAVE ENVISAGED FOR THEM.
350	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES IF THE STRENGTH OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IMPACTS ON THE TRADE IN INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE HIGH-INCOME OECD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION OF RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY WITH THE EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. OUR EMPIRICAL FINDINGS ALSO REVEAL A NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION OF CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT WITH THE EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE CONCLUDE THAT STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS CAN FACILITATE HIGHER LEVELS OF TRADE IN INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

351	DECOMPOSITION OF INTERNATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY OF THE MODERN STATE IN EUROPE ALSO PRODUCES AN IMPACT IN LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY IN COLOMBIA. IMPACT THAT INDUCES IN TO A CRISIS OF DEMOCRATIC ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL STATE. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE THE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GOVERNMENT COVERING THE PERIOD FROM 2002 TO 2010 OR ALVARO URIBE VELEZ GOBERNMENT AND RELATE THIS CRISIS TO THE WARMONGER TREATMENT THAT IS MADE TO THE POLITICAL ENEMY IN THIS PERIOD OF GOVERNMENT, CRISIS THAT PREVENTS ANY POSSIBILITY OF REINSERTING TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE IS DIVIDED INTO TWO STAGES, THE FIRST WHICH ANALYZES THE RECONFIGURATION OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS LEADING TO THE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WORLD, AND A SECOND, WHICH IS INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS ON THE COLOMBIAN STATE THROUGH CARIOUS REFORMS TO JUSTICE AND GOVERNMENT IN THE PERIOD BY THE URIBE GOVERNMENT. ALL THIS TO CONCLUDE THAT A PUNITIVE DISCOURSE ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN THE DEMOCRATIC APPEARANCE OF THE SOCIAL STATE, INVOLVE INCREASING DECLINE OF THE ALTERNATIVES FOR NEGOTIATING WITH AN ARMED ENEMY AND A SOCIAL INSERTION GIVEN THAT IS PREFERRED ITS ANNIHILATION THAN THE REINSTATEMENT IN DEMOCRACY.
352	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING LITERATURE ON ART. 7 TEU BY SHOWCASING THE STRONG AND WEAK POINTS OF THIS PROVISION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ON-GOING RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN HUNGARY AND POLAND - BACKSLIDING WHICH THREATENS THE VERY FABRIC OF EU CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE GENERAL CONTEXT OF THE EU'S INSTITUTIONAL REACTIONS TO THE SO-CALLED "REFORMS" IN POLAND AND HUNGARY, WHICH ARE AIMED AT HIJACKING THE STATE MACHINERY BY THE POLITICAL PARTIES IN CHARGE. NEXT IT INTRODUCES THE BACKGROUND OF ART. 7 TEU AND THE HOPES THE PROVISION WAS ENDOWED WITH BY ITS DRAFTERS BEFORE MOVING ON TO ANALYSIS OF ITS SCOPE AND ALL THE MECHANISMS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING THE KEY PROCEDURAL RULES GOVERNING THEIR USE. THE AUTHOR POSITS THAT IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO PUT OUR HOPES IN ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND POLICIES TO COMBAT THE CURRENT RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING, AND THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY OUTLINING THREE POSSIBLE SCENARIOS TO REVERSE THE BACKSLIDING, NONE OF WHICH ARE (NECESSARILY) CONNECTED WITH ART. 7 AS SUCH.
353	THE ROLE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR IS CENTRAL IN REDUCING INCOME INEQUALITY - THE GOAL OF SDG 10 - BY FACILITATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES MAY ALSO UNDERMINE THIS EFFECT. WE ARGUE THAT SUSTAINABLE BANKING GENERATES BIDIRECTIONAL TRUST TO OVERCOME INSTITUTIONAL WEAKNESSES, PARTICULARLY THE WEAK RULE OF LAW. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM 46 COUNTRIES AGGREGATING DATA OF 1060 BANKS OVER 2010-2017 SHOWS THAT SUSTAINABLE BANKING LESSENS INCOME INEQUALITY IN WEAK RULE OF LAW SETTINGS. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST AFTER INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF BANK DIGITALISATION. THIS STUDY HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE BANKING EXPANSION INTO WEAK INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND DEMONSTRATES BANKS' EFFORTS IN THEIR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING INEQUALITY.
354	IN ESTABLISHING THE ASEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, ASEAN POLITICAL ELITES EMPHASISED THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW ADOPTED IN THE ASEAN CHARTER MIRRORED UN REFORMS THAT RECOGNISED THE RULE OF LAW AS INTERLINKED WITH DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS COMMITMENT RAISES QUESTIONS, GIVEN THE VARIOUS TACTICS EMPLOYED BY THE GROUPING'S AUTHORITARIAN AND POST-AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO SILENCE DISSENT. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY ASSESSES THIS APPARENT SHIFT IN REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. IT FIRST MAPS THE INCLUSION OF RULE OF LAW RHETORIC IN AGREEMENTS SINCE ASEAN'S FOUNDATION, AND THEN EXAMINES THE FORM AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS. IT FINDS THAT DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY RETAINED THE SCOPE FOR PROTRACTED POLITICAL AND BUREAUCRATIC NEGOTIATION BETWEEN DISPUTING PARTIES, AND "OPT OUT" CLAUSES THAT ENABLE THEIR CONTINGENT APPLICATION. THESE FINDINGS UNDERMINE CLAIMS REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A "RULES-BASED COMMUNITY", AND INDICATE THE CONTINUATION OF RULE BY LAW RATHER THAN RULE OF LAW. THE EMPHASIS PLACED ON ASEAN'S RULE OF LAW REFORMS BY ELITES SUGGESTS, THEN, THE REBRANDING OF THIS POLITICAL PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF THE ASEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY SO AS TO CREATE CONFIDENCE FOR INVESTORS IN THE REGION'S JURIDICAL ENVIRONMENT.
355	IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA WERE AT THE EPICENTRE OF THE CENTURY-LONG CONFLICT BETWEEN CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM; MORE SPECIFICALLY, BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE THROUGH LAW. BY THE EARLY 1990S, SOCIALISM IN THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE DECAYED FROM WITHIN LEAVING IN ITS WAKE ECONOMIC MISERY AND INTELLECTUAL EMPTINESS. YET, SOCIALISM IS RAISING ITS HEAD ONCE AGAIN. THIS NEW VARIANT OF SOCIALISM, WHICH I CALL LIBERAL SOCIALISM', HAS ONE CRITICAL DIFFERENCE THAT SETS IT APART FROM ITS PREDECESSORS. UNLIKE ALL THREE TYPES OF SOCIALISM IN THE LAST CENTURY - FASCISM, NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM - LIBERAL SOCIALISM IS NOT IMPOSED FROM THE TOP DOWN; IT IS EMERGING FROM THE BOTTOM UP. THE INCENTIVE EFFECTS OF INCREASING REDISTRIBUTIONAL GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMMES MAP A ROAD TO LIBERAL SOCIALISM BY INFLUENCING THE MEDIAN VOTER AND WEAKENING PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, ELECTION RESULTS IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AND AT STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS IN THE UNITED STATES, SUGGEST THAT THE MEDIAN VOTER HAS NOT MOVED TO THE LEFT. AT THE SAME TIME, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF CREDIBLE AND STABLE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS RELATIVE TO ALL OTHER PROPERTY RIGHTS ARRANGEMENTS. THUS, LIBERAL SOCIALISM IS A REAL THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW BUT ITS SUCCESS IS FAR FROM CERTAIN.
356	THE RECOGNITION OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION UNDER EUROPEAN UNION LAW AFFECTS NATIONAL REGULATIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE COMPETENCE TO REGULATE AND ACT UPON MATTERS RELATING TO THE ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE NATIONAL JUDICIARY IS AN EXCLUSIVELY STATE COMPETENCE, NOT TRANSFERRED BY THE STATES. HOWEVER, OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS BEEN IMPLYING THAT NATIONAL MEASURES CONCERNING THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CANNOT BE CONTRARY TO THE REGULATIONS ON JUDICIAL PROTECTION AS RECOGNISED BY THE UNION. THIS EUROPEAN REGULATION WORKS AS A LIMIT TO THOSE NATIONAL MEASURES RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO REVIEW THEIR "EUROPEANNESS". THESE PAGES SHOW ON WHICH LEGAL BASES, IN WHICH CASES AND WITH WHICH MECHANISMS THIS REVIEW IS TAKING PLACE.
357	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE THE CONSEQUENCES OF FOLLOWING TWO DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF LAW FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, PROVIDED BY FRIEDRICH VON HAYEK AND CARL SCHMITT. THE CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH THIS EXPLORATION IS CARRIED OUT IS THE POLITICAL SCENE OF TURKEY SINCE DECEMBER 2013. IT IS FIRST ARGUED THAT WHILE THE HAYEKIAN UNDERSTANDING OF LAW STRENGTHENS THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, THE SCHMITTIAN UNDERSTANDING UNDERMINES THEM. SECONDLY, IT IS ARGUED THAT JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY GOVERNMENT IN TURKEY HAS FOLLOWED THE SCHMITTIAN UNDERSTANDING OF LAW AT LEAST SINCE DECEMBER 2013 AND THIS IN TURN HAS UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY.
358	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POWER OF ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES TO ASSESS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LEGISLATION ('ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW'), TAKING EXAMPLES FROM SWEDISH PUBLIC LAW. THE SWEDISH CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY REQUIRES ALL PUBLIC BODIES TO ENGAGE IN ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW WHEN NECESSARY. IN THIS WAY, SWEDISH ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES HAVE THE RIGHT AND DUTY TO ACT AS GUARDIANS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS COMPETENCE RELATES TO THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF SWEDISH PUBLIC LAW, WHICH DEVIATES FROM MOST OTHER EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS BY ORGANIZING ALL STATE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES AS SEPARATE PUBLIC ORGANS DETACHED FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MINISTRIES. THE SWEDISH CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION IS PARALLEL TO EU LAW REQUIREMENTS ON NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANS TO SET ASIDE NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN CONFLICT WITH DIRECTLY APPLICABLE EU LAW ('THE COSTANZO OBLIGATION'). AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF PRACTICAL EXAMPLES IN SWEDISH LAW, THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CHALLENGES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES TO ENGAGE IN CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. THESE INCLUDE THE RISK OF DISTURBING CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES BY PUTTING LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES ON PAR WITH THE PARLIAMENT. THE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS OF LACK OF LEGAL EXPERTISE AND THE PROBLEM OF INDEPENDENCE IN PRACTICE ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONCEPT OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW HAS A POTENTIAL TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
359	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW, REVISING MY PREVIOUS VIEW AND CRITICISING SOME ALTERNATIVES. IT FOCUSES ON THE RULE OF LAW'S AIM TO AVOID ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT, AND ON ITS RELATION TO THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT GOVERNMENT ACTION WILL MANIFEST AN INTENTION TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE GOVERNED. AS SUCH, IT IS ALMOST A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE LAW'S ABILITY TO MEET OTHER MORAL DEMANDS, AND IT FACILITATES COORDINATION AND COOPERATION INTERNALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
360	THE LAW IS, ON THE ONE HAND, ALWAYS TO SOME EXTENT AN EXPRESSION OF THE DOMINANT POLITICAL POWER AND IDEOLOGY, WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS RELATIVELY AUTONOMOUS TOWARDS POLITICS AND OTHER VALUE-NORMATIVE SOCIAL PHENOMENA, SUCH AS MORALITY, CUSTOMS, AND RELIGION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT FROM THE DEEPEST ONTOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE THE SEPARATE EXISTENCE OF LAW AND POLITICS IS AN ILLUSION, THIS SEPARATION MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND MAINTAINED IN OUR SOCIAL LIFE. THE MORE AUTONOMOUS THE LAW, THE MORE IT DEVELOPS ITS SPECIFIC IDEOLOGY. THE LATTER CAN EITHER SERVE AS AN APPROPRIATE COUNTERBALANCE TO THE EXCESSIVE TENDENCIES OF POLITICS, OR IT CAN BE ABUSED FOR DIFFERENT POLITICAL PURPOSES. IN THE FIRST CASE, WE CAN SPEAK ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE OF THE LAW VS. POLITICS, WHILE IN THE SECOND CASE ITS ROLE IS (SELF)DESTRUCTIVE. IN THE FIRST CASE DIFFERENT CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS SERVE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, WHILE IN THE SECOND CASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH PHENOMENA ARE BLURRED, WHICH LEADS TO AUTHORITARIANISM OR TOTALITARIANISM.
361	THE CONCEPT OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS DIFFICULT FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ARTICULATE, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO OLDER ADULTS. THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES ITS MEANING, HOW VARIOUS ENTITIES DEFINE AND MEASURE IT, AND DETAILS HOW THIS ISSUE OF GENERATIONS IS ORGANIZED AROUND THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S RULE OF LAW INITIATIVE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK.
362	THIS ARTICLE EMPLOYS THE IMAGE OF THE ANTISYZYGY, THE YOKING OF OPPOSITES, AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC AND UNRESOLVED TENSIONS BUILT INTO THE VERY IDEA OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. IT DESCRIBES THE EU AS A FORMING A SUPRANATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL SPACE WHICH DOES NOT SUPERSEDE NATION STATES, BUT INSTEAD SEEKS TO PRESERVE THEIR SPECIFIC IDENTITIES WHILE PROMOTING AND PROTECTING THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES THEY ARE CALLED UPON TO EMBODY AS LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES. THE ARTICLE THEN CRITICALLY EXAMINES CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UK SUBSEQUENT TO ITS DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SUGGESTS THAT, PARADOXICALLY, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH HELD THE POST-WAR POST-IMPERIAL UNITED KINGDOM TOGETHER AND, WITHOUT IT AND OUTSIDE IT, WE MAY ANTICIPATE THE UK'S IMMINENT DISSOLUTION INTO ITS ORIGINAL CONSTITUENT NATIONS - BREXIT LEADS INEXORABLY TO BREUK-UP.
363	THIS PAPER PROPOSES THE CREATION OF A NEW NONSTATE PUBLIC SPACE TO DEFEND THE "COMMONWEAL" IN WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. THE SERIOUS CRISIS OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS REQUIRES THE CREATION, FROM CIVIL SOCIETY, OF NEW COMPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. THESE INSTITUTIONS MUST HAVE THE DEFENCE OF THE "COMMONWEAL" AS THEIRS FIRST OBJECTIVE. THESE NONSTATE INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF VOLUNTARISM, TRANSPARENCY AND CIVIC COMMITMENT. IN THE FIRST SECTION WE HAVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE POLICIES WHICH ARE NOW QUESTIONING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES: THE NEO-LIBERALISM AND AUTHORITARIANISM (1). THE SECOND PART PRESENTS THE LIMITS OT THE GARANTIST AND NEOCONSTITUCIONALIST THEORIES IN FRONT OF THE CURRENT AUTHORITARIAN AND NEOLIBERAL DERIVES IN THE THE RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS (2). THE TEXT CONCLUDES CLAIMING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ANTHROPOLOGY OF DEMOCRACY THAT OPENS DE DOOR TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS NEW INDEPENDENT PUBLIC SPACE OF THE RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS (3)
364	THIS ARTICLE CRITICISES H. L. HO'S ARGUMENT THAT THE EXCLUSION OF IMPROPERLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE CAN BEST BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF A 'POLITICAL' RATHER THAN 'EPISTEMIC' CONCEPTION OF THE CRIMINAL TRIAL. IT ARGUES THAT AN EPISTEMIC CONCEPTION OF THE TRIAL, AS AN INSTITUTION PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ARRIVING AT ACCURATE VERDICTS ON THE PART OF AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL FACTFINDER, IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE COURT ALSO HAS A DUTY TO UPHOLD OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE SEEN AS CONCERNED WITH UPHOLDING MORAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF VICTIMS AS WELL AS DEFENDANTS. THE 'VINDICATION PRINCIPLE', REQUIRING DECISIONS ON EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF BOTH THESE SETS OF RIGHTS, IS DEFENDED AS BEING CONSISTENT WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND WITH THE EPISTEMIC CONCEPTION OF THE TRIAL.
365	THE STUDY FINDS THAT OPEN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ONLY HAVE EFFECT ON ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, BUT ON SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE MECHANISMS OF RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE ROLE OF RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE EMPHASIZED IN THIS STUDY, BECAUSE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN MEDIATING OPEN GOVERNMENT AND PROSPERITY. UNLESS MECHANISMS LIKE REGULATION FORMULATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE NOT PUT INTO PRACTICE; OPEN GOVERNMENT ITSELF WILL NOT BE A DRIVING FORCE TO A PROSPEROUS SOCIETY.
366	THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CORRUPTION AND POVERTY, INEQUALITY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED WIDELY IN THE INDONESIAN CONTEXT. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON POLITICAL LEGITIMACY IS STILL UNDERSTUDIED, PARTICULARLY FOR POST-SOEHARTO INDONESIA. HENCE, WE ARE LEFT WITH MANY PUZZLES AND A BAFFLING PICTURE OF POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. THIS RESEARCH CORRECTS THIS PICTURE AND AIMS TO ASCERTAIN TWO INTERRELATED QUESTIONS: (A) HOW AND IN WHAT WAY DOES CORRUPTION ERODE POLITICAL LEGITIMACY? AND (B) WHAT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CORRUPTION DETERIORATES LEGITIMACY? A QUALITATIVE AND A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH METHOD ARE DEPLOYED TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS. THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT CORRUPTION IS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, SUGGESTING THAT CORRUPTION ERODES CITIZENS' TRUST IN THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, POLITICAL ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS. THE QUALITATIVE MODEL REINFORCES THE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS THAT CORRUPTION UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, HIJACKS DEMOCRACY AND ERODES PEOPLE'S TRUST IN POLITICAL ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS.
367	NEWS ABOUT THE FIRST BABY BORN AFTER A MITOCHONDRIAL REPLACEMENT TECHNIQUE (MRT; SPECIFICALLY MATERNAL SPINDLE TRANSFER) BROKE ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2016 AND, IN A MATTER OF HOURS, WENT GLOBAL. OF SPECIAL INTEREST WAS THE FACT THAT THE MITOCHONDRIAL REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE HAPPENED IN MEXICO. ONE OF THE SCIENTISTS BEHIND THIS WORLD FIRST WAS QUOTED AS HAVING SAID THAT HE AND HIS TEAM WENT TO MEXICO TO CARRY OUT THE PROCEDURE BECAUSE, IN MEXICO, THERE ARE NO RULES. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLORE MEXICO'S RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO MITOCHONDRIAL REPLACEMENT TECHNIQUES AND SHOW THAT, IN FACT, CERTAIN INSTANCES OF MRTS ARE PROHIBITED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND OTHERS ARE PROHIBITED AT THE STATE LEVEL. ACCORDING TO OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW, THE SCIENTISTS BEHIND THIS FIRST SUCCESSFUL MRT PROCEDURE BROKE FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING ASSISTED FERTILIZATION RESEARCH.
368	GOVERNMENTS THAT LEVY PREDATORY REGULATION AND PROVIDE FEW WEAK LEGAL INSTITUTIONS DRAW BUSINESSES INTO THE UNOFFICIAL ECONOMY AND COMPEL THEM TO HIRE PRIVATE PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS. BASED ON A SURVEY OF SHOPKEEPERS IN THREE CITIES IN RUSSIA. WE FIND THAT RETAIL SHOPS FACE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF PREDATORY REGULATION AND HAVE FREQUENT CONTACTS WITH PRIVATE PROTECTION RACKETS. IN ADDITION, WE SHOW THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF REGULATION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKER LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF CONTACT WITH A PRIVATE PROTECTION ORGANIZATION. WE ALSO FIND THAT SHOPKEEPERS VIEW PRIVATE PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS PRIMARILY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR STATE-PROVIDED POLICE PROTECTION AND STATE-PROVIDED COURTS. THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AS A COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC TRANSITION.
369	A PROMINENT HYPOTHESIS TO EXPLAIN THE DURABILITY OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES FOCUSES ON THE OFFICIAL ADOPTION OF LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY OFFERS A NOVEL EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO TEST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL CONSTRUCTION AND REGIME LEGITIMATION, DRAWING ON A QUASI-EXPERIMENT AND ORIGINAL PANEL SURVEY IN RURAL CHINA. USING DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE, SUBGROUP, AND TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ANALYSES, IT FINDS THAT THE CHINESE STATE'S PROJECT OF LEGAL CONSTRUCTION POWERFULLY SHAPES THE LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF ORDINARY RURAL CITIZENS AND THAT STATE-CONSTRUCTED LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS ENHANCES REGIME LEGITIMACY. THE STUDY ALSO PRESENTS QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL MECHANISM LINKING STATE-CONSTRUCTED LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND REGIME LEGITIMACY: THE EXPANSION OF LOCAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE STATE-RUN LEGAL-AID CENTERS IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE INSTITUTIONAL FOCUS IN DEBATES ABOUT AUTHORITARIAN DURABILITY BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE AT THE INTERSECTION OF STATE AND SOCIETY.
370	SMALL WARS ARE OFTEN MIXED CIVIL-INTERNATIONAL WARS CHARACTERIZED BY EXTREMES OF MUTUAL HATRED. STILL, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF WAR SETS THE STANDARDS FOR ALL ARMED CONFLICTS. WAR-DECISION LAW REGULATES RECOURSE TO ARMED FORCE. WAR-CONDUCT LAW GOVERNS BELLIGERENT PRACTICE. THERE ARE TWO JUSTIFICATIONS FOR RECOURSE TO ARMED FORCE: ENFORCEMENT ACTION ORDERED BY THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL AND INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE SELF-DEFENSE. DESPITE THE PRINCIPLE OF NONINTERVENTION, INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN FREQUENT IN SMALL WARS. THE DIFFICULTY WITH APPLYING WAR-DECISION LAW TO SMALL WARS ARISES FROM THE FACT THAT SUCH WARS ARE OFTEN NOT CONVENTIONAL WARS, MAKING DETERMINATION OF AGGRESSION DIFFICULT. APPLICATION OF WAR-CONDUCT LAW CONFRONTS DIFFICULTIES WITH DETERMINING BELLIGERENT STATUS, DEALING WITH GUERRILLA AND TERROR TACTICS, PRESERVING THE BAN ON CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, AND PROTECTING PRISONERS OF WAR AND OCCUPIED POPULATIONS IN SMALL WARS. THE BEST SANCTION FOR THE LAWS OF WAR IS SELF-ENFORCEMENT BY RESPONSIBLE BELLIGERENTS.
371	THE LITERATURE CONTAINS TWO CONCEPTS OF CORRUPTION WHICH ARE OFTEN CONFUSED WITH ONE ANOTHER: CORRUPTION AS TWISTED CHARACTER (POLLUTION), AND CORRUPTION AS DISLOYALTY. IT ALSO CONTAINS TWO SITES FOR CORRUPTION: THE CORRUPTION OF INDIVIDUALS, AND THE CORRUPTION OF ENTIRE INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS A STATE OR A LEGISLATURE. THIS PAPER FIRST DRAWS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE POLLUTION AND DISLOYALTY CONCEPTS OF CORRUPTION IN THE INDIVIDUAL CONTEXT, AND THEN DEFENDS A CONCEPTION OF DISLOYALTY CORRUPTION ACCORDING TO WHICH THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE IS AN AGENT WHO USES POWERS DELEGATED TO HER FROM HER PRINCIPAL AS HER OWN. THEN, THE PAPER SHIFTS GEARS TO THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, ARGUING THAT THE BEST ACCOUNT OF INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION IN THE EXTANT LITERATURE IS OF THE POLLUTION KIND. IT THEN FILLS THE REMAINING LOGICAL SPACE BY LAYING OUT A CONCEPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL CORRUPTION AS DISLOYALTY AND EXPLAINING ITS MORAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE POLITICAL LEGITIMACY OF A DEMOCRACY.
372	THE PENDING DECISION ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT (BCRA) PROMPTS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD ALLOW BCRA'S INCREASES IN HARD-MONEY SPENDING LIMITS TO STAND IF BCRA'S BAN ON SOFT-MONEY IS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL-THAT IS, WHETHER THE COURT SHOULD "SEVER" THE SOFT-MONEY BAN FROM ANY REMAINING CONSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS OF THIS SWEEPING LEGISLATION. IN THIS ARTICLE, MICHAEL D. SHUMSKY ARGUES THAT, WHEN CONFRONTED WITH UNAMBIGUOUS DIRECTIVES EITHER TO SEVER OR TO INVALIDATE A STATUTE IN ITS ENTIRETY, FEDERAL COURTS ARE BOUND BY CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO THESE STATUTORY PROVISIONS, INCLUDING THE SEVERABILITY CLAUSE CONGRESS ENACTED AS PART OF BCRA. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTIVE REGARDING SEVERABILITY, SHUMSKY CONTENDS THAT PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT POINT TOWARD SEVERING PARTIALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL STATUTES.
373	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN REDRESSING CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES COMMITTED AGAINST THE WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN. MAINSTREAM DISCOURSE APPROACHES THE SITUATION BINARILY, OBLIGING WOMEN TO CHOOSE BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND OFTEN DISTANT HUMAN RIGHTS, ON THE ONE HAND, OR PROXIMATE CULTURAL/RELIGIOUS NORMS, ON THE OTHER, IN ORDER TO ADJUDICATE GENDER CRIMES. THIS CAN LEAD EITHER TO EXTERNALIZED JUSTICE OR, IN THE CASE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AFGHAN LOCAL LAW, TO RENEWED VICTIMIZATION OF WOMEN IN THE NAME OF REDRESSING ABUSES SUFFERED BY OTHER WOMEN. LOCAL LAW IN AFGHANISTAN IS REFLECTED IN CODES SUCH AS THE PASHTUNWALI. THE PASHTUNWALI CONSISTS OF A BLEND OF CUSTOM AND PRACTICE THAT EMERGES FROM A CONTEXT OF EMBEDDED CONFLICT AND IS FILTERED THROUGH AN ISLAMIST LENS. THE PASHTUNWALI PROPOUNDS A RESTORATIVE APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE IN WHICH THE ABUSE IS RECTIFIED WHEN THE FAMILY OF THE ABUSER TRANSFERS MONEY, GOODS, ANIMALS OR, PREFERENTIALLY, YOUNG GIRLS RECENT LITERATURE ON LAW AND CULTURE, THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT CUSTOM AND CULTURE IN AFGHANISTAN AS OPERATIONALIZED THROUGH THE PASHTUNWALI ARE POLITICALLY CONTINGENT (AND AT THE MOMENT DEFINED BY PATRIARCHAL ELITES) INSTEAD OF STATICALLY OR IMMUTABLY OPPRESSIVE TO WOMEN. IF THOUGHTFULLY CONSTRUCTED, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT COLLECTIVE ROLE THAT TRANSCENDS THE ADJUDICATION OF INDIVIDUAL GUILT OR INNOCENCE. THEY CAN PLURALIZE THE NUMBER OF DOMESTIC ACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEFINITION OF CUSTOMARY AND CULTURAL NORMS. THIS IMPLIES THAT TRANSITIONAL CRIMINAL INTERVENTIONS COULD PLAY A DEMOCRATIZING ROLE INSOFAR AS THEY COULD ADVANCE CLAIMS BY ALL MEMBERS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO A RIGHT TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE FORMULATION OF CUSTOMARY LAW. IN THE END, THIS ARTICLE LINKS TRANSITIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE TO THE INNOVATIVE CONCEPTION OF FREEDOM WITHIN CULTURE, INSTEAD OF FREEDOM FROM CULTURE.
374	THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY OR RULE OF LAW IS AN INSTITUTION OF PUBLIC LAW WHICH STATES THE WAY CONSTITUTIONAL BODIES SHOULD ACT. AT THE SAME TIME IT WORKS AS A MECHANISM TO CONFER RESPONSIBILITIES TO OFFICIALS WHEN THEY SURPASS THE LIMIT OF THEIR PROSECUTIONS. THE UNIVERSITIES ALTHOUGH ENJOY AUTONOMY THEY CANNOT OBVIATE THE RULE OF LAW. WITH THE NEW VENEZUELAN CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT ON TODAY SITUATION RELATED TO UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY AND TRY TO FIND A GREATER CONSENSUS TO ACCOMPLISH SUSTENANCE AND STRENGTHEN AUTONOMY. THE PRESENT RESEARCH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH OUT A BIOGRAPHICAL, DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL DESIGN. AS CONCLUSION IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT IS NECESSARY A VERY DETAILED SURVEILLANCE OF THE ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY THE AUTONOMICAL UNIVERSITIES. IT IS NECESSARY TO ADJUST THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY TO DIMINISH THE EXCESSIVE ABUSE AND THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.
375	THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE DOCTRINE OF CIVIL RIGHTS DEVELOPED BY THE "REVIVED" (VOZROZHDENNOE) SCHOOL OF NATURAL LAW IN LATE IMPERIAL RUSSIA. THIS DOCTRINE WAS NOT ONLY OF THEORETICAL BUT OF CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL VALUE AS WELL. IT BECAME THE BASIS FOR THE RULE-OF-LAW THEORY DEVELOPED BY RUSSIAN LIBERAL LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, CAUSED A VIRTUAL REVOLUTION IN THE RUSSIAN INTELLECTUAL ELITE'S CONSCIOUSNESS, AND INFLUENCED THE LIBERATION MOVEMENT. THE PAPER DRAWS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF SOURCES, INCLUDING ACADEMIC AND JOURNALISTIC WORKS OF LIBERAL-MINDED RUSSIAN LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS, E.G., PAVEL NOVGORODTSEV, VLADIMIR SOLOV'EV, EVGENII TRUBETSKOI, BOGDAN KISTIAKOVSKII, VLADIMIR GESSEN, AND OTHERS. THE PAPER SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORIANS, HISTORIANS OF INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT AND LAW.
376	THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN MAY 2000 TO ENCOURAGE INCREASED TRADE AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). IT PROVIDES ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES WITH DUTY FREE ACCESS TO THE US MARKET FOR OVER 1800 PRODUCTS IN ADDITION TO THOSE AVAILABLE UNDER THE GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (GSP). THE BENEFITS EXTEND THROUGH 2025. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE LINK BETWEEN US TRADE PREFERENCES UNDER AGOA AND BENEFICIARY COUNTRY EXPORTS. USING A LARGE US IMPORT DATABASE, THE STUDY EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH AGOA INFLUENCES EXPORT PERFORMANCE. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE MODERATING ROLES OF RULE OF LAW AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. THE RESULTS LARGELY INDICATE THAT AGOA HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON BENEFICIARY COUNTRY EXPORTS. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT RULE OF LAW MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGOA AND EXPORT PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT AGOA WILL TARGET FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) TO SSA FROM OTHER ADVANCED REGIONS SUCH AS THE EU TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE US MARKET. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF FDI APPEARS TO BE WEAK IN MODERATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADE PREFERENCES (TARIFF CONCESSIONS) AND EXPORTS FROM BENEFICIARY COUNTRIES TO THE US MARKET.
377	THE AUTHORS OUTLINE IN THIS REPORT ON URUGUAY BETWEEN 1975 AND 2005: THE DEEPENING OF THE AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM BEGUN IN 1973; HIS ENDING IN 1985 AND, SINCE THEN, THE TRANSITION TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.
378	KOSOVO'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS PLAYED A ROLE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE IN THE COUNTRY'S RECENT HISTORY. THE AUTHOR USES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN LIGHT OF THE WORK AND HISTORY OF OTHER EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. THIS APPROACH SHEDS LIGHT ON THE COURT'S CURRENT ROLE BY ANALYZING KOSOVO'S CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY, WHICH SHOWS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RADICAL BREAK WITH THE PAST. THIS APPROACH REVEALS THE FACT THAT KOSOVO'S CURRENT CONSTITUTION DOES NOT REFLECT THE MATERIAL CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY OF KOSOVO. THIS RADICAL BREAK WITH THE PAST IS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S TRAGIC HISTORY, IN WHICH CASE THE FIGHT FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM MEANS A FIGHT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY. IN THIS BATTLE FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE COURT HAS BEEN GIVEN VERY BROAD JURISDICTION AND A ROLE TO PLAY IN PAVING THE WAY FOR KOSOVO TO MOVE TOWARD EURO-ATLANTIC INTEGRATION IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE. BEFORE REACHING THIS CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE SPECIFICITIES OF KOSOVO'S TRANSITION, COMPARING IT WITH OTHER FORMER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES. AMONG THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN KOSOVO ARE THE ROLE AND POSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING AND THE OVERALL DESIGN OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE IN KOSOVO. THROUGHOUT THE ARTICLE, A CONCLUSION EMERGES THAT PUTS KOSOVO'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE FIGHT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM OF LIBERAL WESTERN PROVENANCE.
379	WE DENY THAT ASYMMETRICAL INFORMATION IS A MARKET FAILURE. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS CASE, WE SUBJECT TO CRITICAL SCRUTINY THE STRONGEST CASE FOR THIS THESIS: THE VIEW THAT LAWS PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING ARE VIABLE, NECESSARY, OR COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
380	IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT POLITICAL DEBATE IN CATALONIA ON THE RIGHT TO DECIDE, THE AUTHOR TRIES TO CLARIFY IN LEGAL TERMS THE SCOPE OF THE EXPRESSION "RIGHT TO DECIDE" AND TRIES TO IDENTIFY WHAT CAN BE PROTECTED AND TO WHAT EXTENT IN INTERNATIONAL LAW. TO THIS END, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE PRINCIPLES AND NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT MAY BE RELEVANT IN THIS CONTEXT: FIRST, THE PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE INTERNAL DIMENSION OF THIS PRINCIPLE, AND, SECOND, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IN INTERNATIONAL LAW CONSTITUTE AN INSEPARABLE TRIAD. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT IN CURRENT INTERNATIONAL LAW IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE SHALL BE THE BASIS OF THE AUTHORITY OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT ALL POLITICAL CLAIMS MUST BE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE BASIS ON WHICH TO BUILD FAIR AND EQUITABLE SOCIETIES.
381	THIS PAPER AIMS AT MAKING USE OF THE ARGENTINEAN SOCIAL SCIENTIST GUILLERMO O'DONNELL'S THEORIES ON DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM, WHICH WERE USED AS THEORETICAL BASES TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC ISSUES IN URBAN STUDIES, SUCH AS THE STRUGGLES CONCERNING ACCESS TO CITY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIAL PROCESS AGENTS (THEIR RECOGNITION AS CITIZENS) AS WELL AS THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF URBAN LAWS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON REPRODUCTION OF ILLEGALITY IN URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THE QUESTIONS PUT FORWARD BY GUILLERMO O'DONNELL LIE IN THE CORE OF THE URBAN NETWORK FORMATION PROCESS AND THE LAND USE LAW, REFLECTING ON THE SUITABILITY OF HIS HYPOTHESES IN SUCH CONTEXT. AS A STARTING POINT, A NEIGHBORING CONFLICT CASE IN ONE OF RIO DE JANEIRO'S BIGGEST SLUMS IS ANALYZED. IN SUCH CASE SOME INTERESTS IN GOODS DIRECTLY RELATED TO URBAN STANDARD OF LIVING ARE EMPHASIZED. BASED ON THIS CASE, SOME IMPORTANT DISCUSSION POINTS ARE IDENTIFIED, WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH TWO TOPICS FUNDAMENTAL TO DEMOCRATIC THEORY REVISION: THE AGENCY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE AIM IS TO MAKE A CRITICAL ANALYSIS ON THE CASE'S DECISION AND ON THE ROLE OF STATE WHEN DEALING WITH URBAN DEVELOPMENT CONTRADICTIONS AS WELL AS EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF COURTS IN THE URBAN GOVERNANCE.
382	THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBSTANTIAL AND SUSTAINED INVESTMENT IN THE ENERGY SECTOR CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED TO PRIVATE INVESTORS THROUGH THE GLOBAL NETWORK OF BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES (BITS), INCLUDING INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) ARE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE ENERGY SECTOR. HOWEVER, THE ISDS SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN SO SIGNIFICANT IN ENCOURAGING INVESTMENT IS UNDER ATTACK. AN INTENSE AND PUBLIC DEBATE IS ON FOOT. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE WAYS IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TREATY SYSTEM AND ISDS ARE DEVELOPING TO ACHIEVE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVATE RIGHTS AND PUBLIC INTERESTS, PARTICULARLY GIVEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, RESPONDING TO CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE SURVEYS REACTIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN SUBSTANTIVE STANDARDS OF PROTECTION UNDER BITS, AS WELL AS THE WAYS IN WHICH THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF SELF-CALIBRATION TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC CONCERNS, NAMELY IN RESPECT OF TRANSPARENCY, STATE COUNTERCLAIMS, LEGISLATIVE DISCRETION, AND THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW GENERATION OF BITS ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DIVIDE. FINALLY, THE AUTHORS CONSIDER HOW ARBITRATION, INCLUDING ISDS, HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC INTEREST, THE GROWTH OF THE RULE OF LAW AROUND THE WORLD. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT WHILE A RANGE OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE INVESTMENT TREATY SYSTEM CAN AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED, THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND ISDS ARE VITAL COMPONENTS OF THE ENERGY INDUSTRY, INTEGRAL TO OUR FUTURE ENERGY SECURITY AND KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO GLOBAL STABILITY THROUGH THEIR PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
383	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE BUILDING OF DEMOCRATIC LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL UNDER THE 1988 FEDERAL CONSTITUTION WITH ITS LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES, VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED BY SOCIETY AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. IN OPPOSITION, THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION INAUGURATED IN 2019 UNDERMINES THIS RULE OF LAW THROUGH TRAGIC CHOICES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTED POWERS, AS WELL AS THE LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL POPULATION ARE STRUCTURED AND ORGANIZED ACCORDING TO THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BUT THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS IS AGAINST TO THE LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT. THE RESEARCH USED THEORETICAL AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH BASED ON BIBLIOGRAPHICAL, DOCTRINAL AND ACCESS TO MEDIA AND WEBSITES, WITH A METHOD OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING. THE RESULT IS THE DEMONSTRATION THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION DECISIONS WEAKEN THE PUBLIC POLICIES PLANNED BY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION IN DESIGNING OF THE DEMOCRATIC LAND-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. THE CONCLUSION IS THE ALICE IN WONDERLAND INTENDED BY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION FOR THE LAND-ENVIRONMENT SECTOR HAS TURNED INTO DANTE'S HELL.
384	RECENT RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT WESTERN DONORS WORKING IN CHINA HAVE CHANNELLED MOST OF THEIR FUNDS TO GOVERNMENT-AFFILIATED ENTITIES, INCLUDING STATE-AFFILIATED THINK TANKS, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, RATHER THAN TO GRASSROOTS CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS. A MORE STATE-CENTRED APPROACH MAY HAVE MADE SENSE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE REFORM ERA, WHEN FEW NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS EXISTED IN CHINA THAT COULD SERVE AS EFFECTIVE PARTNERS TO WESTERN DONORS. YET THE RAPID GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY SECTOR IN CHINA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS MEANS THAT A NUMBER OF NEW ACTORS ARE DOING VERY IMPORTANT WORK ON A RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT WESTERN FUNDING FOR NEWLY-FORMED GRASSROOTS CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS IS CRUCIAL TO THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE CIVIL SOCIETY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE GRASSROOTS GROUPS CAN OFTEN MAKE FULLER USE OF KEY ADVOCACY TOOLS, SUCH AS INTEREST GROUP MOBILISATION, MEDIA ADVOCACY, AND STRATEGIC LITIGATION, THEY MAY IN SOME CASES BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IN PURSUING PROGRESSIVE GOALS THAN ACADEMIC OR GOVERNMENT-AFFILIATED ENTITIES. WESTERN DONORS ACTIVE IN CHINA SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF THE RAPIDLY-CHANGING CIVIL SOCIETY LANDSCAPE IN CHINA AND MAKE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR FUNDING STRATEGIES ARE IN LINE WITH THE EVOLVING COUNTRY CONTEXT.
385	THIS ARTICLE GRAPPLES WITH THE TRICKY ISSUE OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN POST-SOEHARTO INDONESIA. IT RECOGNIZES THE GREAT STRIDES THE COUNTRY HAS MADE TOWARD ESTABLISHING A RIGHTS-BASED DEMOCRACY. THIS INCLUDES ATTEMPTS TO TACKLE THE LEGACIES OF DECADES-LONG AUTHORITARIANISM - FOR INSTANCE, THOSE TIMES WHEN STATE ELITES HAVE PUT SELF-INTERESTEDNESS ASIDE TO COOPERATE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW INSTITUTIONS THAT PROMOTE GENUINE DEMOCRATIZATION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN INDONESIA WILL CONTINUE TO BE BEDEVILED DUE TO THE POOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF A DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. UNTIL STATE ELITES AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS PREDICTABLY CAN BE RELIED UPON TO ENFORCE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAW THEMSELVES, THEN A MEANINGFUL DEEPENING OF INDONESIA'S ELITIST/ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY WILL BE UNOBTAINABLE.
386	BY REFERENCE TO LEGAL POSITIVISM AND HART'S CONCEPT OF LAW, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT POPULISM TARGETS AND AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF RECOGNITION. IN PARTICULAR, POPULISM EXPLOITS THE AMBIGUITIES IN THE NATURE OF THIS SOCIAL RULE, BY ADVOCATING THE EXTENSION OF THE GROUP WHOSE CONSENSUS DETERMINES THE CRITERIA OF LEGAL VALIDITY FROM THE RESTRICTED SPHERE OF JUDGES AND OFFICIALS, TO THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. POPULISM INSTRUMENTALISES THE FUNCTIONS OF THE RULE OF RECOGNITION, AIMING TO PROVOKE UNCERTAINTY IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH A SHIFT AND, THUS, ALTER THE CONTENT OF THE RULE. INFILTRATING CONCEPTS WITH MEANINGS THAT SUIT ITS ENDS AND REORDERING THE CRITERIA OF LEGAL VALIDITY, POPULISM PRIORITISES AN ABSOLUTE FORM OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY OVER A THIN, DUBIOUS VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. NEVERTHELESS, THE LATTER'S AMBIGUITY ALLOWS POPULISM TO CLAIM THAT THE RULE OF LAW STILL FORMS PART OF ITS RULE OF RECOGNITION.
387	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CONFLICTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIDEO SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. WITH THIS PURPOSE, TWO RECENT CASES RESOLVED BY THE HIGH COURTS OF JUSTICE ARE REVIEWED. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE MAIN CONSIDERATIONS OF SUCH SENTENCES, THE AUTHOR DEVELOPS THREE ASPECTS THAT HE CONSIDERS PROBLEMATIC: THE SCOPE OF THE CONCEPT OF PRIVACY, ADVOCATING FOR A BROAD SENSE OF THIS RIGHT, ALSO EXTENDED TO THE PUBLIC SPHERE; THE IMPORTANCE THAT UNDERLIES THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF INTRUSION TO PRIVACY; AND THE NECESSARY BALANCE OF INTERESTS VIA THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY.
388	IN THIS PAPER THE SIGNIFICATION AND ORIGINS OF THE IDEA OF RULE OF LAW ARE SUMMARIZED, DISTINGUISHING ITS CLASSICAL SENSE FROM THAT ILLUMINIST AND BINDING IT WHAT APPEARS TO BE NECESSARY WITH VIRTUE ETHICS AND TO THE NOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THEREBY, THE COMPLETE FORMULA OF COMMON GOOD OF GENERAL JUSTICE WILL ROOT IN THE SUPREMACY OF LAW, WHICH IS THAT OF PRACTICAL-ETHICAL REASON, ALONG WITH THE PRESENCE OF MORAL VIRTUES BOTH IN RULERS AND SUBJECTS, AS WELL AS THE RESPECT FOR THE NATURAL RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS.
389	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN (SSA) COUNTRIES. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES (I) THE INTERACTING IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW ALONGSIDE OTHER SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES TO DETERMINE FOREIGN CAPITAL INFLOW (FCI) BASED ON EACH ECONOMIC SSA BLOC; AND (II) THE CHARACTERISTIC DRIVERS OF FCI, IMPACTING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE SSA COUNTRIES. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, STATIC MODELS, LEAST SQUARE DUMMY VARIABLES (LSDVS) AND THE DYNAMIC SYSTEM GENERAL METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM) WERE EMPLOYED AS THE STUDY'S ESTIMATING TECHNIQUES. BASED ON THE RESULT OF THE LSDV, FOOD SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT FCI IN THE SUB-ECONOMIC BLOCS IN THE REGION. ONLY SIX COUNTRIES ACROSS THE FOUR ECONOMIC BLOCS RESPONDED TO FOOD SECURITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MODEL. THE DYNAMIC SYSTEM-GMM PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF FIVE SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES AND THREE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES CONTRIBUTING TO FCI. THE FINDINGS REVEALED (I) REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE GOVERNANCE VARIABLES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED FCI; AND (II) FOOD SECURITY FAILED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT FCI IN THE SSA REGION. HOWEVER, INFLATION, LIFE EXPECTANCY, THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX, EXCHANGE RATE AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH IMPACTED FCI SIGNIFICANTLY. IN THE AGGREGATE, INFLATION, REGULATORY QUALITY, EXCHANGE RATE AND THE HUMAN CAPITAL INDEX EXHIBITED POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS, WHILE OTHER VARIABLES SUCH AS LIFE EXPECTANCY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW APPEARED SIGNIFICANT BUT INVERSELY IMPACTED FCI IN THE SSA REGION. THE KEY POLICY IMPLICATION RECOMMENDATION FROM THIS STUDY IS THAT A GOOD LEGAL FRAMEWORK COULD MODERATE THE FLOW OF FOREIGN CAPITAL IN FAVOUR OF GROWTH AS IT CREATES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION.
390	MID-2000S LATIN AMERICA WITNESSED SERIOUS POLICY DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE MODES, DELIVERY METHODS AND GOALS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE (ECEC). MEXICO IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ECEC TO WORKING MOTHERS AND YOUNG FAMILIES. HOWEVER, BEHIND POLICY DISCOURSE LIE VERY REAL SECURITY CONCERNS FOR SERVICE USERS. THIS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY INCIDENTS SUCH AS THE 2009 DEATH OF 45 CHILDREN AT A DAYCARE, AN EVENT WHICH WOULD SEVERELY UNDERMINE POLICY DEVELOPMENT. USING A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK, WE ARGUE THAT SECURITY CONCERNS TRUMPED OTHER ISSUES FOR USERS, INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CURRICULUM, AND DERAILED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ECEC POLICIES. WE USE AN ORIGINAL DATABASE OF 2005-2013 NEWS REPORTS ON ECEC FOR TWO MEXICAN NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS TO ESTABLISH THE NARRATIVE FOR THAT PERIOD. WE ARGUE THAT UNTIL GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW CONCERNS ARE ADDRESSED, NO AMOUNT OF DISCOURSE AND POLICY DESIGN WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN THIS VITAL AREA.
391	THE NEW OWN-INITIATIVE REPORT THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IS PREPARING HAS THREE AIMS: TO PROVIDE A FORMAL EVALUATION OF THE RECENT INITIATIVES BY THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL; TO PRESENT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE; AND TO DO SO IN THE FORM OF A LEGISLATIVE REPORT, SO AS TO OBTAIN A FORMAL REACTION FROM THE COMMISSION. THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE PROPOSED SEVERAL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU. IT IS TIME TO PUT THEM INTO A COHERENT SYSTEM. THE REPORT WILL FOCUS ON FIVE ISSUES: THE BODY FOR A PERMANENT COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY MONITORING OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE EU; THE ROLE OF THE AGENCY FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS; WHETHER AND HOW INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURES SHOULD BE REVISITED IN THIS CONTEXT; WHAT A PROPER PRE-ARTICLE 7 TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU) PROCEDURE SHOULD LOOK LIKE; AND WHAT A VALID LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES SHOULD BE.
392	GORTON AND WINTON (1998) LINK THE SIZE OF THE BANKING SYSTEM IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES TO FINANCIAL STABILITY. WE PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR NOTION THAT THE SIZE OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WILL BE SMALLER IN THESE COUNTRIES. THIS EFFECT HOLDS EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW AND/OR LEGAL ORIGIN, AND OTHER RELEVANT VARIABLES. TRANSITION ECONOMY STATUS, THUS ADDS ADDITIONAL EXPLANATORY POWER TO TRADITIONAL LAW AND FINANCE EXPLANATIONS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. CLASSIFICATION OF TRANSITION ECONOMIES BY LEGAL ORIGIN REVEALS THAT RUSSIAN LEGAL ORIGIN HAS A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWS CLAIMS ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR/GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) TO BE 46 TO 60 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, AND 23 TO 39 PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER IN NON-SOVIET TRANSITION ECONOMIES COMPARED TO COUNTRIES OF ENGLISH LEGAL ORIGIN. THERE IS A POSITIVE RELATION BETWEEN CLAIMS ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE RULE OF LAW FOR A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF COUNTRIES.
393	LEGAL INDICATORS, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS RULE OF LAW INDICATORS, GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, OR INDICATORS OF PUBLIC SERVICE PERFORMANCE, ARE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF THE PERFORMANCE OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. THEY ARE USED BOTH AS SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOCIETIES AND AS MEANS OF GOVERNING THEM (TECHNOLOGIES OF GOVERNANCE). AS A RESULT, THESE INDICATORS HAVE BEGUN TO ATTRACT CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION FROM SCHOLARS, POLICY MAKERS, AND OTHER ACTORS. KEY ISSUES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: WHEN, WHY, AND BY WHOM ARE VARIOUS KINDS OF LEGAL INDICATORS PRODUCED? ARE THEY RELIABLE AND VALID? HOW INFLUENTIAL ARE THEY? GIVEN THEIR INFLUENCE, SHOULD THEY BE REGULATED, AND IF SO, HOW? THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS RECENT EFFORTS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. THE OVERARCHING THEME IS THAT ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER.
394	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON FINANCIAL ANALYSTS' FORECAST ACCURACY AND FORECAST UNCERTAINTY. I EMPLOY AN INTERNATIONAL SAMPLE OF 71 COUNTRIES CLASSIFIED INTO TWO SUBSAMPLES OF ADVANCED ECONOMIES AND EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES TO CAPTURE UNDERLYING HETEROGENEITY. THE EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY INVOLVES A DYNAMIC PANEL ANALYSIS THAT TESTS FOR PERSISTENCE WHILE IT CONTROLS FOR ENDOGENEITY. THE MAIN FINDING SHOWS THAT CORRUPTION INCREASES FORECAST UNCERTAINTY AND REDUCES FORECAST ACCURACY, THOUGH SOME VARIABILITY IS OBSERVED ACROSS COUNTRIES. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIPS, I ALSO INVESTIGATE TWO OTHER CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH CORRUPTION COULD AFFECT ANALYSTS' FORECASTS USING INTERACTIONS TERMS WITH EARNINGS MANAGEMENT AND RULE OF LAW. EARNINGS MANAGEMENT AMPLIFIES THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION ON FORECAST ACCURACY, WHEREAS THE RULE OF LAW MITIGATES IT. ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS FURTHER DEMONSTRATES THAT ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS ENHANCING LEGAL ENFORCEMENT AND PROVIDING GREATER FREEDOM, IMPROVE ANALYSTS' FORECAST ACCURACY.

395	THERE IS A HEALTHCARE CRISIS IN DEVELOPING AND RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED COUNTRIES THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BURDEN OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND THE RAPID RISE OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THE FIRST LINE OF TREATMENT FOR BOTH COMMUNICABLE AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IS THE USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS. ALMOST ALL DRUGS DEEMED TO BE "ESSENTIAL MEDICINES" BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ARE OFF-PATENT AND AVAILABLE AS GENERICS AND NEARLY ALL OF THE PATENTED, BRAND-NAME ESSENTIAL MEDICINES ARE DEEPLY DISCOUNTED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, OFTEN MATCHING GENERIC PRICES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS, ONE-THIRD OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL MEDICINES. THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT PATENTS OR PRICE ARE MAJOR BARRIERS TO MARKET ACCESS, OR CAUSATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES, IN DEVELOPING AND RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED MARKETS. THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, LIKE ALMOST ALL INDUSTRIES, USES DIFFERENTIAL PRICING WORLDWIDE WHEREIN PRICES ARE INVERTED TO THE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND. THE REAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE MONEY, POWER, POLITICS, AND IDEOLOGIES, WHICH MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN MARKET FAILURE, CORRUPTION, AND THE LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO CREATE STABLE, ETHICAL, AND LAW-ABIDING GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE PRODUCTS ARRIVE WHERE THEY ARE DESTINED WITHOUT DELAY, DIVERSION, THEFT, OR UNNECESSARY TARIFFS. THERE IS A NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, ROADS, COMMUNICATIONS, HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES, PROVIDER COMPLIANCE, PATIENT ADHERENCE, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATORY STRUCTURES AND PROTECTIONS. ENHANCED STATE CAPACITY TO SERVE INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW-INCLUDING HARMONIZED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION-ARE INTEGRAL TO PROMOTING GLOBAL HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE, IN WHICH PHARMACEUTICALS PLAY A VITAL ROLE. THERE ARE NO QUICK-FIX SOLUTIONS.
396	CONSTRUCTING AN ASSESSMENT INDEX SYSTEM OF LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF A CITY PROVIDES A DATA BASIS AND AN EMPIRICAL BASIS FOR CHINA???S URBAN CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HIGHLIGHTS ITS CHARACTERISTICS IN THE ERA OF BIG DATA. A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THIS INDEX SYSTEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDEX SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE BASED ON A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CORE CONTENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF A CITY, AND THEN TO DETERMINE THE CONNOTATION OF LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF A CITY. THIS SERVES AS THE STARTING POINT FOR CONSTRUCTING THE INDEX SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE A SOLID GRASP OF THE INDEX THEORY, ADHERE TO THE METHOD OF INDEX SETTING, BREAK DOWN THE CONCEPT OF LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF A CITY INTO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INDICATORS ACCORDING TO THE TYPES AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE INDICATORS AND CONTINUE TO VISUALIZE AND OPERATIONALIZE THEM UNTIL THE CONTENT CAN BE MEASURED. AS A WHOLE, THIS FORMS A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT INDEX SYSTEM. OF COURSE, THE CONTENT OF THE INDEX SYSTEM IS NOT FIXED AND NEEDS TO BE CONSTANTLY TESTED AND ADJUSTED IN PRACTICE.
397	THE QUESTION ADDRESSED BY THIS PAPER IS WHETHER LAWS THAT ARE PERFECTLY CONSTITUTIONAL (I.E., COMPLY WITH ALL CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR ALL RELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS) CAN NEVERTHELESS BE DEPRIVED OF THEIR LEGAL EFFECT BECAUSE THEY OFFEND SOME PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY 'YES': LEGAL INTERPRETERS REGULARLY ENGAGE IN A NON-CONSTITUTIONAL FORM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT DENIES LEGAL VALIDITY TO STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT VIOLATE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THE PAPER GIVES THREE EXAMPLES: VIOLATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-CONTRADICTION; VIOLATIONS OF THE PROHIBITION ON EXCESSIVELY VAGUE STATUTES; AND VIOLATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT LIKE CASES BE TREATED ALIKE. AS THE PAPER ARGUES, THIS LAST PRINCIPLE IS, AT BOTTOM, A REQUIREMENT OF RATIONALITY, SO THAT IRRATIONAL STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE REGULARLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR LEGAL EFFECTS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF THE INCREASING CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
398	THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS ON WILLIAM E SCHEUERMAN'S THE END OF LAW AND THE VALUE OF THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW. IT PUTS SCHEUERMAN'S CONCERNS ABOUT SCHMITT'S ATTACKS ON THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW IN DIALOGUE WITH SCHMITT'S THEORY OF 'LEGAL REVOLUTION'. IT ARGUES THAT, ALTHOUGH SCHMITT WAS NEITHER A LIBERAL NOR A DEMOCRAT, HIS WORK ON LEGAL REVOLUTION CAN HELP LIBERALS RESPOND TO POPULIST ATTACKS ON LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL ESSENTIALS.
399	MANY STATES GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDE FOR MERCY POWERS, MOST PROMINENTLY THE POWER TO GRANT PARDONS. THIS RAISES A POTENTIAL CONFLICT: THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT LIKE CASES BE TREATED ALIKE. MERCY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS USUALLY UNDERSTOOD AS BEING UNFETTERED BY LEGAL PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF TREATING LIKE CASES ALIKE. FOCUSING ON STATE OFFICIALS' PARDON POWERS AS AN EXAMPLE OF MERCY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WE SHOULD CONCEIVE OF PARDONS AS MIRACLES. LIKE MIRACLES WHICH SUSPEND INDIVIDUAL LAWS OF NATURE, PARDONS SUSPEND LEGAL RULES ON AN INDIVIDUAL AND DISCRETIONARY BASIS. ONCE SUSPENDED, THE LEGAL RULES NO LONGER APPLY TO THE GIVEN CASE, AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO CONFLICT BETWEEN PARDONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. AS I WILL SHOW, THIS DISCRETIONARY SUSPENSION OF LEGAL RULES IS A PREREQUISITE FOR PARDONS TO FULFIL THEIR FUNCTION AS A CORRECTIVE TO UNDESIRABLE LEGAL RESULTS.
400	JAVIER DE LUCAS HAS SUCCESSFULLY AND RIGOROUSLY TACKLED MANY RESEARCH TOPICS IN HIS LONG ACADEMIC LIFE. FROM IMMIGRATION, RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA, TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION, THROUGH HIS DOCTORAL THESIS ON DURKHEIM OR HIS WORK ON CLASSICS SUCH AS CONDORCET, THE CONCEPT OF SOLIDARITY, TOLERANCE, THE PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY, THE PATERNALISTIC JUSTIFICATION OF POWER, SECRECY AND TRANSPARENCY OR THE KANTIAN PRINCIPLE OF PUBLICITY, AMONG MANY OTHERS. THIS BRIEF ARTICLE, HOWEVER, FOCUSES ON A VERY SPECIFIC CONTENT OF HIS ENORMOUS WORK: THE ATTICUS CODE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY.
401	EMERGENCY POWERS ARE AS OLD AS CONSTITUTIONALISM, REFLECTING FUNDAMENTAL TENSIONS IN THE RULE OF LAW THAT PERVADE MANY ASPECTS OF POLITICAL LIFE. HENCE, EXPLORING PHILOSOPHICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF EMERGENCIES CAN LEAD TO BROADER CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LAW AND INDIVIDUAL POWER. BY ENGAGING NOT JUST EMERGENCY POWERS BUT ASPECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WITH A SIMILAR STRUCTURE, DAVID DYZENHAUS CONCLUDES THAT ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO RULE IN A 'SPIRIT OF LEGALITY' ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ASPIRATIONAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMPIRICAL AND NORMATIVE ENQUIRY. RELATED QUESTIONS ARISE IN OREN GROSS AND FIONNUALA NI 'AOLA ' IN'S NEW BOOK. THESE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT EXISTING EMERGENCY LAW RESTS ON AN EMPIRICAL MISTAKE WITH SERIOUS NORMATIVE CONSEQUENCES. IF EMERGENCIES LACK DISCRETE BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS, WHICH INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS MINIMIZE THESE CONSEQUENCES? BOTH BOOKS LEAVE CRITICAL QUESTIONS IN THEIR WAKE, BRILLIANTLY EXPLORING-WITHOUT SETTLING THE QUESTION OF EXTRA-LEGAL ACTION. THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP OF IS AND OUGHT REMAINS: WHAT IS THE PLACE OF EMPIRICAL FACTS OF POLITICAL LIFE IN NORMATIVE ENQUIRY? AND WHAT ROLE DO NORMATIVE CONSIDERATIONS PLAY IN ESTABLISHING EMPIRICAL CONDITIONS?
402	WAR CRIMES ARE AMONG THE MOST SERIOUS CRIMES; THAT IS WHY INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS HAVE JURISDICTION TO PROSECUTE AND PUNISH THEM. HOWEVER, SERIOUS THOUGH THEY ARE, IT IS NOT LEGITIMATE TO PUNISH THEM IN SUCH A WAY AS TO EXCEED THE BOUNDS OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THAT, WHEN THE PERPETRATORS OF WAR CRIMES ARE PROSECUTED AND PUNISHED, CRITERIA INHERENT TO THE RULE OF LAW LIKE THOSE APPLIED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (SUCH AS LEGALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY) MUST BE MET.
403	THE NOTION THAT THE TORAH REPRESENTS A SUPERVENING "RULE OF LAW" THAT CIRCUMSCRIBES THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE KING STEMS FROM A PARTICULAR DEUTERONOMISTIC SCRIBAL CIRCLE THAT WORKED LONG AFTER THE DAVIDIC MONARCHY HAD ENDED. USING ZEDEKIAH'S EDICT (JER 34:8-22) AS A CASE STUDY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW DEUTERONOMISTIC REDACTORS RECAST THE FINAL NORMATIVE LEGAL ACT OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDAHITE KING AS HIS PIOUS APPLICATION OF PENTATEUCHAL LAW.
404	THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL. SUPREMACY RECLAIMS THE PRESENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION, WITHIN JURIDICAL ORDER, AS A BASIC NORM AND DETERMINES WHAT DEFINES THE FORMAL SCOPE AND MATERIAL OF ALL OTHER NORMS. THIS IS ACHIEVED DUE TO THE FUNCTIONING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL GUARANTEES THAT NO LEGAL OR POLITICAL WILL THREATENS THE ESSENTIAL NUCLEUS OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. GUARANTEEING THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ACHIEVES LIMITATIONS ON POLITICAL POWER AND THAT THE SCOPE OF OF POWER STATE AGENTS WORKS TOWARDS SAFEGUARDING THE PRINCIPLE OF FREEDOM FOR ALL OF THOSE UNDER THE SAME SOCIO-CULTURAL POSITION. THEREFORE, THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY DECISIVELY INTERVENES IN THE PROCESS OF GRANTING BENEFITS TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDERPRIVILEGED WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING INEQUITY RESULTING IN THE FORMAL AND MATERIAL PROVISIONING OF DIGNITY, LIFE, AND AUTO-DETERMINATION TO ALL OF ITS ASSOCIATES AS PROCLAIMED BY THE RULE OF LAW. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS ARTICLE'S OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW SUCH AS SEPARATION OF POWERS, CONSTITUTIONAL BLOCK, CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL, AND PROTECTION TO FUNDAMENTAL.
405	POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES OFTEN FACE CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING JUSTICE FOR CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THE CONFLICT, ESTABLISHING TRUTH, SECURING REPARATIONS, AND ESTABLISHING GUARANTEES OF NON-RECURRENCE. LAYERED OVER THESE CHALLENGES ARE OTHER COMMON CHALLENGES IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO RESTORING RULE OF LAW, BOTH IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IN APPLYING AND FULFILLING THE LAW AND REBUILDING SOCIETAL TRUST IN STATE INSTITUTIONS. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA ("CICIG'), WHICH BRINGS INTERNATIONAL PROSECUTORS INTO GUATEMALA TO CO PROSECUTE CASES OF CRIMINAL NETWORKS IN NATIONAL COURTS ALONGSIDE NATIONAL PROSECUTORS, PRESENTS A NOVEL MODEL FOR TRANSNATIONAL JUSTICE COOPERATION, LABELED IN THIS NOTE AS A "GRAFTING" MECHANISM. IN CONTRAST WITH TRADITIONAL APPROACHES OF TRUTH COMMISSIONS, INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS, AND HYBRID TRIBUNALS, GRAFTING MECHANISMS DO NOT CREATE NEW OR FREESTANDING MECHANISMS BUT ATTACH INTERNATIONAL ELEMENTS TO EXISTING NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROMOTE COOPERATION AND INNOVATION, ACCORDING TO LOCAL NEEDS. THROUGH THE LENS OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW SCHOLARSHIP, THIS NOTE EXPLORES WHAT FACTORS DEFINE A GRAFTING MECHANISM AND ALLOW IT TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST AND STRENGTH TO NATIONAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. THE NOTE FIRST DISCUSSES THE NEW ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF GRAFTING MECHANISMS AND THEN EXPLORES THE CREATION AND EXPERIENCE OF THE CICIG BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO GLEAN LESSONS FOR FUTURE GRAFTS. THE NOTE CONCLUDES THAT FOR A SUCCESSFUL GRAFT, FLEXIBILITY, COLLABORATION, AND A DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PARTS OF THE GRAFT ARE NECESSARY.
406	THIS ESSAY CONSIDERS THE VIRTUE OF CLARITY AS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, ITS PROMOTION REQUIRES A SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IN WHICH THE INSTITUTION CALLED TO CREATE THE LAW IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ORGAN CALLED TO APPLY IT. IN THIS WAY, THE VALUES OF PROSPECTIVITY, GENERALITY AND PROMULGATION -DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE IDEA OF CLARITY- ARE CORRECTLY PROTECTED AND ACHIEVED. IN CONTRAST, A REGIME IN WHICH THE COURTS HAVE AUTHORITY NOT ONLY TO ADJUDICATE CASES, BUT ALSO TO LEGISLATE THROUGH JUDICIAL DECISIONS, CREATES AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY AND RETROACTIVITY, BOTH LEGAL VICES TOTALLY REJECTED BY THE VERY NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
407	SITUATED IN RELATION TO ON-GOING CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE UNDERTAKES A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE OFFENCES OF VILIFICATION OF THE STATE IN THE 1930 ITALIAN PENAL CODE AND THE CRIME OF SEDITIOUS LIBEL IN ENGLISH COMMON LAW DURING THE INTERWAR PERIOD. IT ARGUES THAT THERE WERE IMPORTANT COMMONALITIES IN THE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THESE OFFENCES, WHICH INDICATE THAT THE APPARENTLY DIVERGENT LEGAL SYSTEMS OF FASCIST ITALY AND DEMOCRATIC BRITAIN SHARED A SIMILAR APPROACH TO THE CONCEPTION AND PROTECTION OF STATE INTERESTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE USES THAT HISTORICAL COMPARISON TO HIGHLIGHT KEY CONTINUITIES AND TENSIONS WITHIN EACH SYSTEM, IN ORDER TO QUESTION THE MEANINGS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE RULE OF LAW, TO RECONSIDER THEORETICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF STATE POWER AND LAW IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, AND TO CHALLENGE UNDERSTANDING OF COMMON EUROPEAN (LIBERAL) LEGAL TRADITIONS AS A POSITIVE FORCE TODAY.
408	THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND THE CONSEQUENT FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF JOINT ACTION FOR THE SPECIAL PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO FIND CHANNELS FOR INCREASINGLY OUT OF TRADITIONAL MOLDS LEGAL RULE OF LAW DELVE SPECIFICALLY IN THE RELEVANT TECHNIQUES FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. ONE IDEA TO RIG OPERATING RESULTS IN THE RECOGNITION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN PARTICULAR CASES THAT CALL FOR JOINT ACTION BY DIFFERENT ENDONATIONAL DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT LEVEL, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED PRINCIPLE. RECOGNIZED THE LEGAL EXISTENCE OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, IT BECOMES THE SOURCE, ON THE RUNWAY, WHERE ARISE REAL DUTIES/POWERS OF ENDONATIONAL PUBLICS GOVERNMENTS TO COOPERATE IN ORDER TO ENSURE FAIRNESS IN THE PARTICULAR CASE. SPECIFICALLY IT IS ESTIMATED THAT, ON CONSTITUTIONAL COMMANDS, THE GOVERNMENT MUST ACT TOGETHER AND IN A PARTICIPATORY MANNER TO SERVE IN ADMINISTRATIVE STAGE AND PREVIOUS TO JUDICIAL ONE, SPECIFICALLY TO MEET THE MINIMUM CORE OF INTEREST, REAL OR FUNDAMENTAL VALUES INVOLVED IN INDIVIDUAL CASES.
409	LUCY LURIE'S REJECTION OF LEGAL AVENUES OF REDRESS IS PERHAPS THE MOST NOTABLE AND INSCRUTABLE TWIST IN J. M. COETZEE'S 1999 NOVEL DISGRACE. IN CONTRAST, HER FATHER, DAVID LURIE, IS THE ONLY CHARACTER IN THE NOVEL TO SEEK THE PROTECTION OF "THE LAW" EXPLICITLY, FIRST IN CHALLENGING THE PROCEDURES OF THE UNIVERSITY COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MELANIE ISAACS AND, LATER, IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ATTACK AT HIS DAUGHTER'S FARM. THERE, HIS INVESTMENT IN "THE LAW" STANDS IN OPPOSITION TO THE PERCEIVED LAWLESS, "ANTHROPOLOGICAL" WORLD OF THE EASTERN CAPE (118). THIS ESSAY WILL FOCUS ON WHAT IS INVOKED AND RENOUNCED IN THE NAME OF "THE LAW" IN DISGRACE, SHOWING THE RANGE AND SPECIFICITY WITH WHICH THE LAW IS DEPICTED IN THE NOVEL AND OFFERING, AS A RESULT, A CONTEXT IN WHICH TO LOCATE LUCY'S REJECTION OF LEGAL AVENUES OF REDRESS. BUILDING ON CRITICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE NOVEL'S ENGAGEMENT WITH SPECIFIC LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND INSTITUTIONS, THE ESSAY WILL ARGUE THAT THIS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE NOVEL'S WIDER PREOCCUPATION WITH THE LEGAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE POST-APARTHEID STATE, WITH THE CULTURAL AND POPULAR BASIS OF LEGALITY MORE GENERALLY, ITS COLONIAL AND APARTHEID LEGACY, AND THE PROTECTION THAT THE LAW CAN OFFER TO WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. DISGRACE ENGAGES DIRECTLY WITH THE ENORMOUS INVESTMENT IN THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA, THE ESSAY ARGUES, NOT BY CONJURING UP AN IMAGE OF POST-APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA AS LAWLESS, BUT BY QUESTIONING THE LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAW AS PURE, UNIVERSAL, RATIONAL THE MEDIUM ABOVE ALL IN WHICH DIFFERENCE CAN BE TRANSACTED. CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WORKINGS OF THE LAW IN DISGRACE REVEALS AN ACUTE CONCERN ON THE PART OF COETZEE WITH THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE LEGACY OF COLONIAL AND APARTHEID MODES OF GOVERNANCE INSCRIBED WITHIN IT, AND THE NEOLIBERAL PRESENT THAT SHAPES IT.
410	ARTICLE 14(2) OF THE HONG KONG NATIONAL SECURITY LAW CONTAINS THIS OUSTER CLAUSE: ' HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMMITTEE [FOR SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION] SHALL NOT BE AMENABLE TO JUDICIAL REVIEW'. DOES THIS MAKE THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE ITS OWN LEGAL ISLAND, WHOLLY EXEMPT FROM JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT OF ANY KIND? NOT NECESSARILY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT MAY NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IT APPEARS TO BE IN PREVENTING THE COURTS FROM REVIEWING THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE'S DECISIONS. FIRST, IN THE ABSENCE OF THE CLEAREST AND MOST EXPLICIT WORDS, THE HONG KONG COURTS CAN STILL CONSTRUE THE OUSTER CLAUSE, IN LIGHT OF THE COMMON LAW CONSTRUCTION APPROACH, AS ONLY BARING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF A VALID AND LAWFUL DECISION MADE BY THE COMMITTEE. THIS MEANS THE HONG KONG COURTS CAN STILL REVIEW SOME DECISIONS. SECOND, THE HONG KONG COURTS CAN ALSO JUSTIFY JUDICIAL REVIEW BY REFERRING TO THE RULE OF LAW, A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE COMMON LAW IN HONG KONG. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT NO FORM OF OUSTER CLAUSE, HOWEVER CLEAR AND EXPLICIT, COULD EXCLUDE FROM THE SUPERVISION OF THE COURTS A DECISION THAT NEGATES A HONG KONG RESIDENT'S RIGHT OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
411	EMOTION MANAGEMENT IN RELATION TO POLICE LEGITIMACY DURING THE PANDEMIC IN POLAND OFFERS AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE STUDY OF BACKFIRE MECHANISMS IN TIMES OF THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. GROUNDED IN SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM, THE STUDY USES QUALITATIVE FRAME ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE: WHAT EMOTION MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES EMBEDDED IN DISCURSIVE FRAMES WERE USED BY THE POLICE AND THE STATE TO BUILD AND REBUILD POLICE LEGITIMACY DURING THE PANDEMIC? WHY DID THEY BACKFIRE? MASKING, A STRATEGY NEGATIVE IN VALENCE, BACKFIRED. IGNORING EMOTIONS EXPERIENCED BY OFFICERS IN FRAMES CONSTRUCTED TO GAIN LEGITIMACY WIDENED THE RIFT BETWEEN POLICE AND ORDINARY PEOPLE. FOR THE LATTER, IT WAS EQUIVALENT TO LOSING ANOTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTION TO THE RULING STATE. IF MASKING IS THE ONLY STRATEGY IN USE, LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL LIKELY BE PERCEIVED NEGATIVELY, AND CITIZENS WILL RESIST, IMPAIRING THE ABILITY OF THE POLICE TO PERFORM ITS DUTIES.
412	THE RIGHTS TO ENTER AND EXIT THE UNITED KINGDOM ARE LIMITED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WHICH HAVE IN COMMON A DESIRE TO PROTECT THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY. ONE OF THE RELEVANT MECHANISMS, THE LEGAL BASIS OF WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN OVERHAULED, IS THAT OF 'AUTHORITY TO CARRY' (ATC) SCHEMES, WHICH REQUIRE TRANSPORT COMPANIES TO REQUEST PERMISSION TO BRING PERSONS IN AND OUT OF THE UK AND PUNISH THEM IF THEY DO SO WITHOUT PERMISSION. THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE RELEVANT LAW AND CONSIDERS IT FROM TWO POINTS OF VIEW: FIRST, THE RULE OF LAW ISSUES RAISED BY THE PAST AND PRESENT OPERATION OF THE RELEVANT SCHEMES AND, SECOND, THE LESSONS OF ATC SCHEMES FOR THE PRIVATIZED ENFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL SECURITY NORMS AND THE POSSIBLE ATTENUATION OF THE SCOPE FOR LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEIR OPERATION.
413	THERE APPEARS TO BE A REMARKABLE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION SCIENCE AND IN PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION PRACTICE. IN THE FORMER, LEGAL APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY MANAGERIAL AND POLITICAL APPROACHES. THIS SHIFT SHARPLY CONTRASTS WITH THE CONTINUOUS LEGALIZATION AND JURIDIFICATION OF PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION PRACTICE. PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION PRACTICE HAS GRADUALLY CONVERGED WITH THE LAW. LAWYERS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS APPLAUD THE CONVERGENCE OF THE LAW AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AS THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THE IDEAL OF THE RECHTSSTAAT. A PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE SHOULD TAKE A MORE CRITICAL STANCE. FROM A PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE, THE RECHTSSTAAT PRODUCES BOTH FUNCTIONAL AND DYSFUNCTIONAL EFFECTS. ASSESSING THESE EFFECTS REQUIRES COMPARATIVE AND MULTI-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. COMPARATIVE RESEARCH WILL REVEAL DIFFERENT LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITIONS BOTH WITHIN EUROPE AND BETWEEN EUROPE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE RECHTSSTAAT SHOULD THEREFORE RETURN ONTO THE PUBLIC-ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AGENDA.
414	IN THE LITERATURE, THE NEXUS BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CORRUPTION IS WELL COVERED, BUT THERE ARE ONLY FEW STUDIES ON CYCLICAL VARIATIONS OF CORRUPTION. FOR EXAMPLE, GALBRAITH (1997) CLAIMS THAT EMBEZZLEMENT FLOURISHES IN BUSINESS BOOMS AND WITHERS IN RECESSIONS, AND GOKCEKUS AND SUZUKI (2011) SUPPORT THE CLAIM BY FINDING A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN TRANSITORY INCOME AND CORRUPTION. THIS PAPER RETESTS THE ARGUMENT AND PRODUCES CONFLICTING RESULTS. IT IS FOUND THAT CORRUPTION SHRINKS AS TRANSITORY INCOME INCREASES MEANING THAT ECONOMIC BOOMS FOSTER INTEGRITY RATHER THAN CORRUPTION. MOREOVER, THE NEGATIVE CORRELATION IS STRONG IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES AND IN THOSE WITH SOUND RULE OF LAW WHICH POINTS TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHEREAS THE EFFECT REMAINS RELATIVELY WEAK IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW INCOME OR POOR RULE OF LAW WHICH POINTS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE FINDING IS RELEVANT ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
415	THE IMMENSE BODY OF CONTEMPORARY WORK AIMED AT PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IS OFTEN ACCUSED OF NEO-IMPERIALISM. YET, DESPITE MANY POINTS OF CONTIGUITY BETWEEN PAST AND PRESENT LEGAL INTERVENTIONS, THE CHARGE IS OVERBROAD AND RARELY ILLUMINATING. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO MOVE BEYOND POLEMIC TO TRACK CONCRETE HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL FORERUNNERS OF TODAY'S RULE OF LAW WORK. FOCUSING MAINLY (THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY) ON LATE IMPERIAL BRITISH ENDEAVOURS, IT TRACES COLONIAL LEGAL INTERVENTIONS OVER TIME, THE TECHNIQUES ADOPTED (AND REJECTED), THE SHIFTING NORMATIVE BASES OF LEGITIMACY, AND MOMENTS OF STRATEGIC RECALIBRATION IN THE FACE OF RESISTANCE. THREE BROAD ATTITUDES TOWARDS LAW ACROSS THE PERIOD ARE (PROVISIONALLY) CHARACTERISED AS REGULATIVE, CONSTITUTIVE AND INSTITUTIVE MOMENTS. IN EACH PHASE, THE POWERS TREAT COLONIAL TERRITORIES AS LABORATORIES OF STATEHOOD, WITHIN WHICH EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED TO LOCATE THE OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION OF LAW. IN CONCLUSION SOME COUNTERPARTS TO THESE MOMENTS IN TODAY'S RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES ARE IDENTIFIED.
416	HOW CAPABLE IS THE LATIN AMERICAN STATE? THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES TAX, CIVIL SERVICE, AND ELECTORAL DATA AS WELL AS PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS IN THE AREAS OF PUBLIC SAFETY, RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC REGULATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES, TO COMPARE THE REGION WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND TO DEFINE INTRA-REGIONAL DIFFERENTIATION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE LATIN AMERICAN STATE IS NOT VERY STRONG OR EFFECTIVE, BUT THE STATES OF CHILE AND BRAZIL ARE PERHAPS THE BEST IN THE REGION.
417	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFGHANISTAN. WE USE A SET OF QUARTERLY TIME SERIES DATA FROM 2003Q1 TO 2018Q4 TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS. FOLLOWING TODA AND YAMAMOTO'S (J ECONOM 66(1-2):225-250, 1995. 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01616-8) VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE MODEL AND THE MODIFIED WALD TEST, OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW A UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND THE ECONOMIC GROWTH. OUR FINDINGS EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS RUNNING FROM ECONOMIC GROWTH TO THE ERADICATION OF CORRUPTION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, QUALITY OF REGULATORY MEASURES, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. MORE INTERESTINGLY, WE SUPPORT THE SIGNIFICANT MULTIDIMENSIONAL CAUSALITY HYPOTHESIS AMONG THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. OVERALL, OUR FINDINGS NOT ONLY REVEAL CAUSALITY BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, BUT THEY ALSO SHOW INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS.
418	ON ITS INCEPTION, THE NON-CONVICTION-BASED ASSET CONFISCATION AND FORFEITURE REGIME ATTRACTED BOTH PRAISE AND CRITICISM. USING THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ANALYTIC FRAMEWORK, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE NON-CONVICTION-BASED ASSET CONFISCATION AND FORFEITURE REGIME UNDER BOTSWANA'S PROCEEDS AND INSTRUMENTS OF CRIME ACT, 2014. THE PAPER FINDS THAT WHILST THE REGIME HAS WITHSTOOD CONSTITUTIONAL ATTACKS, IT STILL RETAINS SOME SHORTCOMINGS. FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS LACK OF CLARITY ON THE STANDARDS OF PROOF, PROCEDURES AND INADEQUATE PROTECTION OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. THE PAPER RECOMMENDS REFORMS.
419	THE PRESIDENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC HAS FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTIVELY INTERVENE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND EXPRESS HIS OPINION ON THE CURRENT SITUATION, EXCEPT FOR ONE: THE POWER TO VETO LAWS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERS BELONGING TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC'S HEAD OF STATE, THROUGH WHICH THE PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO INFLUENCE THE RESULTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE CZECH CONSTITUTION, THE VETO MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A WRITTEN EXPLANATION, WHICH GIVES THE PRESIDENT AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS HIS OWN VIEW OF NOT ONLY THE PARTICULAR LAW BEING VETOED BUT THE GENERAL POLITICAL SITUATION AND DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONING IS GREATER IF THE STATE IS HEADED BY A STRONG FIGURE WITH A CLEAR VISION OF HOW SOCIETY SHOULD FUNCTION. THE FIRST CZECH PRESIDENT, VACLAV HAVEL, WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SUCH A FIGURE. THIS STUDY WILL BRING A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF VACLAV HAVEL'S VETO REASONINGS, AND POINT OUT HOW HE SYSTEMATICALLY BASED HIS ARGUMENTATION ON THREE PRINCIPLES: RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL PLURALITY, AND A JUST (HUMANE) SOCIETY.
420	THIS ESSAY AIMS TO ASSESS THE VITALITY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY BY SUBJECTING IT TO THE ACID TEST OF CARL SCHMITT'S CRITIQUE AGAINST LIBERALISM. IN EMERGENCY SITUATION, SOMEONE, THE PRESIDENT, THE COURT, OR WHOEVER THE CASE MAY BE, HAS TO TAKE DECISIVE ACTION TO COPE WITH THE EMERGENCY. THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK THAT ANY SUCH EXERCISE OF SOVEREIGN POWER MAY LEAD TO ITS ABUSE. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT IN PLACE A RULE TO ADDRESS SUCH ABUSE IN ADVANCE DUE TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF EMERGENCIES. THE AUTHOR REJECTS SCHMITT'S DEMOCRATIC MYSTICISM, WHICH ARGUES FOR POPULAR GOVERNMENT BASED SOLELY ON THE PEOPLE'S WILL FOR REMEDYING THE DEFICIENCIES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. INSTEAD, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE KEY TO RESOLVING THE PROBLEM OF INDETERMINACY IN RULE OF LAW IN STATES OF EMERGENCY SHOULD BE BUILDING THE CONVENTIONS, WHETHER LEGISLATIVE OR JUDICIAL, NECESSARY TO CONTROL THE SOVEREIGN'S EXERCISE OF EMERGENCY POWER, ALTHOUGH IT MAY TAKE MUCH TIME FOR SUCH CONVENTIONS TO BE WIDELY ESTABLISHED IN THE SOCIETY. THIS STANDS WHETHER ONE TAKES WITTGENSTEIN'S VIEW THAT INDETERMINACY CAN BE SEEN AS INHERENT IN THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW ITSELF OR HAYEK'S FUNCTIONALIST DEFINITION OF RULE OF LAW.
421	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES A RECENT CANADIAN ENTRY TO THE ACCRETION OF LEGAL TEXTS WHICH QUESTION, TO VARIOUS DEGREES, LAW'S ANTHROPOCENTRISM: THE DISSENTING JUDGMENT OF THE ALBERTA COURT OF APPEAL IN REECE V. EDMONTON (CITY OF). WRITTEN BY CHIEF JUSTICE CATHERINE FRASER, THE 162-PARAGRAPH DISSENT STANDS OUT IN THE CANADIAN LANDSCAPE (AND IS IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE) GIVEN THE EXISTING CANADIAN LAW ADDRESSING ANIMAL ISSUES THAT EITHER REGULATE ANIMALS AS OBJECTS AND/OR SUBORDINATE ANIMAL INTERESTS TO HUMAN OR CORPORATE ONES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE DISSENT IN REECE DEPARTS FROM THE STANDARD LEGAL INSTRUMENTALIST VIEW OF ANIMALS BY PROVIDING A NON-ANTHROPOCENTRIC ANALYSIS OF THE ANIMAL INTERESTS AT STAKE. THE DECISION THUS PROVIDES A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT ANIMALS WHEN COMPARED TO THE EXISTING CANADIAN JURISPRUDENCE. THE DISSENT'S DEPARTURE FROM THE TRADITIONAL ANTHROPOCENTRIC LEGAL VIEW OF ANIMALS IS SEEN IN THREE MAIN WAYS: (1) THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE IT ASSIGNS TO THE ANIMAL INTEREST LEGALLY AT ISSUE BY CONNECTING IT TO THE RULE OF LAW; (2) THE RESPECT IT AFFORDS TO CRITIQUES OF ANIMALS' CURRENT LEGAL STATUS (INCLUDING THE ANIMAL RIGHTS CRITIQUE SEEKING TO ABOLISH THE PROPERTY STATUS OF ANIMALS AND THE DEFAULT SUBORDINATION OF ANIMAL INTERESTS TO HUMAN OR CORPORATE ONES); AND (3) THE EMPATHY AND RESPECT IT GIVES TO THE INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL AT THE HEART OF THE LEGAL DISPUTE BY RECOGNIZING HER AS A SENTIENT AND VULNERABLE BEING WHOSE SUBJECTIVITY MATTERS. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT IS A JUDGMENT THAT NOT ONLY PROVIDES THE MOST SOPHISTICATED CANADIAN JUDICIAL ANALYSIS TO DATE OF THE LAW'S RELATIONSHIP TO ANIMALS, BUT IMPUGNS THE TRADITIONAL ANTHROPOCENTRIC PARADIGM THROUGH WHICH THE LAW MINIMALLY RESPONDS TO (SOME) ANIMAL SUFFERING.
422	THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION LITERATURE BY USING FUZZY-SET QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (FSQCA) IN THE ANALYSIS OF 76 CASES COMPOSED OF EUROPEAN UNION AND AFRICAN UNION COUNTRIES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RATIFICATION OF TREATIES, ESTABLISHMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS, AND HIGH GDP PER CAPITA IN THE ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW, PLAY CRUCIAL ROLES IN THE HIGH RATE OF PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN EUROPE. IN AFRICA, HOWEVER, THE LOW GDP PER CAPITA AND ABSENCE OF RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS IN EUROPE, WHILE HIGH GDP PER CAPITA AND RULE OF LAW ARE PARAMOUNT TO IMPROVING HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION IN AFRICA IN RELATION TO ANY INSTITUTIONAL CONFIGURATION, APPROACH, OR POLICY.
423	PARLIAMENT IS HIGHLIGHTED IN OTTO KIRCHHEIMER'S WORK ON THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC. WHETHER TO CRITICIZE THE CHOICE OF PARLIAMENTARISM SYSTEM IN NATIONAL CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY, OR TO DEFEND IT FROM THE EXECUTIVE POWER THAT PROMOTED THE LOOTING OF ITS POWERS, THIS IS THE INSTITUTION THAT HAS CENTRALITY IN THE AUTHOR'S ANALYSIS BETWEEN 1928 AND 1933. IN TWO BOOKS AND FIFTEEN ARTICLES ON POLITICAL INTERVENTION, THE MEANING AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE LEGISLATIVE POWER WORKS WERE PERMANENTLY DEBATED. AT FIRST, DUE TO THE CHANGE GENERATED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF REPRESENTATION OF THE WORKING CLASS, ONLY POSSIBLE AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSAL VOTE. EVEN SO, THE LEGALITY AND DEMOCRACY PROMOTED BY THE WEIMAR CONSTITUTION WERE VIEWED WITH SUSPICION BY KIRCHHEIMER. ONLY WHEN THE SUPPRESSION OF LEGALITY - INCLUDING ITS APPEARANCE - ERODED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC, DID KIRCHHEIMER UNEQUIVOCALLY RECOGNIZE AN EMANCIPATORY VALUE IN THE RULE OF LAW FORM.
424	IN THIS CONTRIBUTION I CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ARGUMENTATIVE ACTIVITY OF LEGAL PROCEEDING. I DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE FROM A PRAGMA-DIALECTICAL PERSPECTIVE AND EXPLAIN IN WHICH WAY THIS ROLE PROMOTES A RATIONAL RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE. I SPECIFY HOW A CRITICAL DISCUSSION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IDEAL MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED IN LEGAL PROCEDURE TO ACCOMPLISH THE INSTITUTIONAL POINT, A RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
425	OVER THE LAST DECADES, ACADEMIC INTEREST IN JUDICIAL GLOBALIZATION AND JUDICIAL REFORMS HAS INCREASED. THE LITERATURE HAS GONE THROUGH THREE DISTINCTIVE WAVES OF RESEARCH. ONE PART OF THIS LITERATURE EXAMINES JUDICIAL REFORMS FROM A TOP-DOWN PERSPECTIVE, REVEALING THE ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF EUROPEAN/INTERNATIONAL PRESCRIPTIONS RELATED TO RULE OF LAW CONSOLIDATION. BY LOOKING AT THE MOTIVATIONS AND ACTIONS ON THE GROUND, ANOTHER STRAND OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF THESE PRESCRIPTIONS AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL. IN ADDITION, IN RECENT YEARS, A MORE REFLEXIVE AND CRITICAL APPROACH TO JUDICIAL REFORMS HAS EMERGED, QUESTIONING NOT ONLY THE MODEST OUTCOMES OF THESE REFORMS BUT ALSO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW COMMUNITY IN PROMOTING THEM. THIS INTRODUCTORY ARTICLE REVIEWS THIS GROWING BODY OF STUDIES, HIGHLIGHTING THE MAIN FINDINGS AND POINTING OUT NEW AVENUES FOR RESEARCH. IN ITS FINAL SECTION, IT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE LINES OF REASONING AND THE CONTENT OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. OVERALL, IT ENDEAVORS TO SHED MORE LIGHT ON JUDICIAL REFORMS IN THE REGION AND TO PROMOTE THIS RESEARCH AGENDA, WHICH IMPLIES TO EXAMINE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDICIAL GLOBALIZATION, EUROPEANIZATION AND GLOCALIZATION.
426	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ADDRESS, AS A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE, THE ISSUE OF HOW WE CAN BETTER FACE THE RISKS AND DANGERS OF EVERYDAY SOCIAL RELATIONS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, VERIFYING TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATE OF EXCEPTION CAN ASSIST IN THIS PROCESS. THE METHODOLOGY USED IS HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE, STARTING WITH THE DEMARCATION OF WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD BY SOCIETY OF RISKS AND WHAT IS THE RELATION THAT IT MAINTAINS WITH THE RULE OF LAW, TO THEN INVESTIGATE TO WHAT EXTENT THE STATE OF EXCEPTION IN SUCH CONTEXTS SEEMS COMPATIBLE. IN TERMS OF PROCEDURAL METHODOLOGY, WE WILL USE SOME NEURAL WORKS OF EXCEPTIONAL STATE THEORISTS, POSITIONING US ON THE POSSIBILITY OF EQUATING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE STATE OF EXCEPTION TO BETTER APPROACH WITH THE RISKS AND DANGERS THAT SOCIAL RELATIONS TODAY ARE IMPOSED.
427	AN ESSAY ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SUBJECT, THE WORK OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY. A TASK THAT IS AS USEFUL FOR CITIZENS AND THE RULE OF LAW AS IT IS UNKNOWN IN THE ACADEMIC, JUDICIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SPHERES. IN ADDITION TO THE DISSEMINATION OF THE RELEVANT ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SECURITY, THIS HETERODOX RESEARCH DEALS WITH THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN BASED ON HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
428	TACKLING CORRUPTION REGULARLY APPEARS ON THE AGENDAS OF ALMOST ALL GOVERNMENTS. ANTI-CORRUPTION PUBLIC POLICIES AIM TO PREVENT CORRUPT BEHAVIOUR BOTH AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND IN EVERYDAY SOCIAL LIFE. ON THE ONE HAND, CORRUPTION SERIOUSLY UNDERMINES THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW; ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ENFORCEABILITY OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY LINKED TO THE RULE OF LAW DETERMINES THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE ENFORCEABILITY OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CORRUPT ACTS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN THE SLOVAK POLITICAL ARENA DURING THE ELECTORAL PERIODS FROM 1994 TO 2020. THIS OBJECTIVE IS FULFILLED BY ANSWERING RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON THE INCIDENCE RATE AND DEFINITION OF CORRUPT CONDUCT IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC ENVIRONMENT. THE MAIN METHOD OF THE PAPER IS A COLLECTIVE CASE STUDY CONDUCTED ON 219 CASES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE SOCIETAL PRESSURE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY OF POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY IS INCREASING OVER TIME. HENCE, THE IMPORTANCE OF ANTI-CORRUPTION PUBLIC POLICY IS GROWING, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS REMAINS QUESTIONABLE. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH POINT TO LOW LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY, ESPECIALLY UNDER LEFT-WING GOVERNMENTS.
429	IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN PUBLIC VERNACULAR 'TRANSFORMATION' HAS BECOME A KEY NOTION, BUT ITS MEANING IS, TO PUT IT MILDLY, UNCLEAR. BRINGING CLARITY OF MEANING TO, OR REMOVING THE CONFUSION CAUSED BY WIDESPREAD OPPORTUNISTIC MISUSE OF THE TERM IS NOT ATTEMPTED HERE, BUT THE LIMITS OF ITS EMPLOYMENT, ESPECIALLY IN LAW, ARE EXPLORED. FIRST THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF TRANSFORMATION ARE SKETCHED AND ITS IDEOLOGICAL, INTELLECTUAL AND LEGAL NOTIONS IDENTIFIED. A REVIEW OF THE SURFACING IN LEGISLATION AND JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONCEPT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES IS PRESENTED. FINALLY, BY MEANS OF A CONCLUSION, THE LIMITS OF TRANSFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW. WHILE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE THEME OF 'TRANSFORMATION' HAS PENETRATED SOUTH AFRICAN LAW, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT LAWYERS INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMANDS OF REASONABLE BALANCE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATE THE LIMITATIONS THAT THE LAW IMPOSES ON THIS PLIABLE, AND IDEOLOGICALLY COMPROMISED NOTION. A REVIEW OF LEGISLATION REVEALS A DISCONCERTING PICTURE OF INDETERMINACY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE SYSTEMATIC, BUT MOSTLY UNANNOUNCED, TRANSLATION OF IDEOLOGICAL GOALS INTO LEGISLATION. THE JUDICIAL USE OF THE CONCEPT, SOMETIMES IN ITS INTELLECTUALISED FORM, SOMETIMES IN DISGUISED OR OPENLY DOGMATIC FASHION, HAS NOT CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO REMOVE THE UNCERTAINTY, BECAUSE CLEAR AND OBJECTIVE REFERENCE TO ITS FULL CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING IS LARGELY ABSENT. IT IS FOUND THAT THE IDEOLOGICAL RENDERING OF 'TRANSFORMATION' IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION, BUT, IF GIVEN A MEANING IN TUNE WITH THE CONSTITUTION, THE PURSUIT OF 'TRANSFORMATION' MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO BE A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE COMPLIANT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. 'TRANSFORMATION', APPROPRIATELY CONSTRUED, SHOULD NOT BE PROBLEMATIC, BUT THE INDETERMINATE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS BEING UTILISED, ESPECIALLY IN LAW, IN A MANNER CONTAMINATED BY IDEOLOGY NOT SUPPORTED BY THE CONSTITUTION, TENDS TO NEUTRALISE THE RULE OF LAW.
430	IN ORDER TO TACKLE DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN EU MEMBER STATES, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED A NEW FINANCIAL CONDITIONALITY IN MAY 2018 THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SUSPENSION OF EU FUNDS IN CASES OF SYSTEMATIC RULE OF LAW INFRINGEMENTS. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL IN TERMS OF ITS CHANCES AT SUCCESSFULLY DETERRING OR REDRESSING SUCH INFRINGEMENTS. DRAWING ON BOTH THE LITERATURE ON EU ENLARGEMENT AND ON INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS, WE IDENTIFY A LIST OF SCOPE CONDITIONS FOR CONDITIONALITY IN ORDER TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND ANALYZE THE CONTEXT OF APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY ON EU FUNDS WITH REGARD TO ITS EXPECTED EFFECTIVENESS. WE FIND THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WOULD INDEED IMPROVE THE SPEED AND LIKELIHOOD OF SANCTIONS COMPARED TO EXISTING MECHANISMS, BUT LACKS IN THE DETERMINACY OF CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES, THUS UNDERMINING ITS PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY AND CHANCES OF SUCCESS.
431	STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE PENOLOGY STILL LACK ENGLISH WRITINGS ABOUT PENAL CULTURES IN NON-ANGLO-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT STEER THEIR FOCUS AWAY FROM IMPRISONMENT. THIS ARTICLE FILLS THIS GAP BY GIVING ACCOUNTS OF PENAL CONTROL IN THAILAND AND HOW ITS CRIMINAL JUSTICE PRACTICES DIFFER FROM THE WESTERN MODELS BY WHICH THEY WERE INSPIRED. ALTHOUGH QUITE SIMILAR IN FORMS, THAI COURT ROUTINES DIVERGE FROM THE WEST IN THE TIGHTNESS OF PROCEDURAL CONTROL OVER DEFENDANTS. THIS IS THE LEGACY OF A SELECTIVE IMPORTATION OF WESTERN KNOWLEDGE IN RESPONSE TO WESTERN COLONIAL PRESSURES IN THE PAST. WITH ITS OWN VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL CULTURE OF CONFORMITY, ORDER IS PRIORITISED AND CONTROL IS EMPHASISED ARGUABLY TO THE DETRIMENT OF PROPORTIONALITY AND DUE PROTECTION OF DEFENDANTS' RIGHTS. SUCH CONTRAST TO THE LIBERAL RIGHTS-BASED SPIRITS OF THE WESTERN-STYLED RULE OF LAW REFLECTS CULTURAL AND SOCIO-POLITICAL DIFFERENCES WHICH INFLUENCE LOCAL ADAPTATIONS OF THE WESTERN-ORIGINATED CONCEPTS. ALTHOUGH THE PROPENSITY FOR CRIME CONTROL IS DEFENSIBLY PROMINENT IN MANY WESTERN JURISDICTIONS NOWADAYS, THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE THAI DIVERGENCE IN THE UNDERPINNING LEGAL MENTALITY AND INTENSITY OF CONTROL.
432	STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSOLIDATING DEMOCRACY IS STILL A CHALLENGE FACING COUNTRIES IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE (SEE). DESPITE THE PROSPECTIVE FOR EU ACCESSION FOR THE WESTERN BALKAN STATES AND FULL EU MEMBERSHIP FOR OTHERS, ISSUES REGARDING THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND THE EFFICIENCY OF LEGAL PROCEDURES ARE STILL AT STAKE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE WEAKENED STATE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN SEE COUNTRIES WHILE ALSO BLOCKING THEIR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A SOBER VIEW ON THE DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION PROCESS, EMPHASIZING THAT A DECLINE FROM DEMOCRATIC POLITICS MAY HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT. FOR ONE, DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE ARE EXPOSED TO NATIONALISM AND POPULISM, SUFFERING FROM WEAK INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND A BURDENSOME COMMUNIST LEGACY. FURTHERMORE, NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES AND PRACTICES OF EXERCISING POLITICAL POWER IN SEE COUNTRIES HAMPER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, EFFICIENT DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS, AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENTS. CORRUPTION AND CLIENTELISM LIKEWISE SEEM EMBEDDED IN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURES. THUS, IN THE ABSENCE OR INEFFICIENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN SEE COUNTRIES IS OFTEN DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF A 'STATE CAPTURE', NOT DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO A MID-TERM PERSPECTIVE, POSITIVE CHANGE IS STILL POSSIBLE, BUT IT REQUIRES ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS EU INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY BUILDING IN THE REGION. IN SOME CASES, MOREOVER, COORDINATED ENDEAVORS BETWEEN ACTIVE CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS AND EU INSTITUTIONS COULD EXERCISE EFFECTIVE PRESSURE ON THE NATIONAL POLITICAL ELITES TO INTRODUCE NECESSARY INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS.
433	THIS ESSAY ARGUES AGAINST LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND ETHICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TORTURE. IN THE EXPOSITORY SECTIONS OF THE ESSAY, I JUXTAPOSE INTERNATIONAL PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TORTURE WITH THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION'S JUSTIFICATIONS FOR HARSH INTERROGATION METHODS ON THE BASIS OF MILITARY NECESSITY AND PRESIDENTIAL PREROGATIVE. I EXAMINE THE SYSTEMATIC AND INDIVIDUAL CAUSES OF THE SPECIFIC ABUSES AT ABU GHRAIB THAT WERE TANTAMOUNT TO TORTURE. IN THE CONSTRUCTIVE SECTIONS OF THE ESSAY, I RETRIEVE THE EVOLVING STANDARDS OF DECENCY FROM SUPREME COURT CASES AND JUS COGENS PEREMPTORY NORMS FROM INTERNATIONAL LAW. I CONTEND THAT TORTURE IS DEONTOLOGICALLY WRONG AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENTS ON SOLELY TELEOLOGICAL GROUNDS ARE ETHICALLY FLAWED AND CONTRADICTORY. ENGAGING NUMEROUS INTERLOCUTORS IN LAW, PHILOSOPHY, AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS, I RECONCEPTUALIZE THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF MORAL VISION AND AN EMERGING MORAL CONSENSUS, AND I HOLD THAT THESE TERMS PROVIDE A MORE ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING AND REPUDIATING THE PRACTICE OF TORTURE.
434	LAW IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS A SYSTEM OF LEGAL NORMS THAT SEEKS TO PROMOTE INTER-SUBJECTIVE COOPERATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL PEACE. ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON THE EXISTENCE OF A HARMONIOUS SET OF GENERAL NORMS BUT ALSO ON THE FACT THAT JUDGES FOLLOW A COMMON AND UNIFORM INTERPRETIVE PLATFORM. OTHERWISE, THE INSTRUMENTAL VALUE OF LAW WOULD BE DEPRECIATED. CONCERNING THE PROBLEM ABOVE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEVELOP A SERIES OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS SHOULD SATISFY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW. IN MATTERS OF JUDICIAL FREEDOM AND RESTRICTION, THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO REFLECT ON THE POSSIBILITY TO GUARANTEE LEGAL CERTAINTY, PRESERVE HUMAN RIGHTS, AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR DIGNITY.
435	CHINA HAS CONSISTENTLY STRIVEN TOWARD ECONOMIC GROWTH AT THE EXPENSE OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS; HOWEVER, CHINA FACES AN IMPASSE AS ITS SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS THREATEN TO DAMAGE ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH, A TENSION THAT IS BEST ILLUSTRATED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT. WITH THE ADVENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC AWARENESS THAT HAS ALLOWED CORRUPTION TO THRIVE IS DECREASING. AS A RESULT, CHINA IS BEGINNING TO ACCEPT THAT ECONOMIC RIGHTS MAY BE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS, AND THAT IT MUST SOMETIMES YIELD TO THE LATTER IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE FORMER. SPECIALIZED ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS, CREATED BY LOCAL COURTS TO MANAGE ENVIRONMENTAL UNREST, ARE THE PERFECT TARGET FOR CONCRETE REFORMS THAT, IF SUCCESSFUL, WOULD IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. MOREOVER, THE CENTRALIZATION OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL COURTS MAY CREATE THE BACKDOOR OPPORTUNITY THAT THE CENTRAL COMMUNIST PARTY NEEDS TO PIERCE LOCAL PROTECTIONISM AND ADVANCE ITS SINCERE INTERESTS IN BOTH PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND QUELLING VISIBLE UNREST.
436	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HOW POLITICAL STRATEGIES INTERRELATE POPULIST RHETORIC WITH MEMORY ISSUES. BY LOOKING AT THE CASE OF THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PSD) FROM ROMANIA, BETWEEN 2017-2019, THIS ARTICLE REVEALS HOW THE SLIDE TO POPULISM, GENERATED BY CYCLICAL CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS, STEERED THE PSD TO ADOPT CONSPIRATIONAL BELIEFS AND APPEAL TO TRAUMATIC MEMORIES TO FRAME THE JUDICIARY AS THE NEW SECURITATE. THROUGH THE USE OF DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND VIRTUAL ETHNOGRAPHY, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES PARTY RESOLUTIONS AND POLITICAL RALLIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS HOW THE POPULIST RHETORIC CREATED A NEW HEGEMONIC NARRATIVE OF THE JUDICIARY, BY INTERSECTING ITS VALUES AND SYMBOLISM WITH THE MEMORY OF THE FORMER SECURITATE FROM THE COMMUNIST PERIOD.
437	BUILDING ON TWO GLOBAL SYMPOSIA HOSTED BY THE VERFASSUNGSBLOG AND CONVENED BY THE AUTHOR, THE 2020 "COVID-19 AND STATES OF EMERGENCY" AND THE 2021 "POWER AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC", IN ADDITION TO THE FINDINGS OF THE DEMOCRACY REPORTING INTERNATIONAL `RULE OF LAW STRESS TEST' WHICH SURVEYED EU MEMBER STATES' RESPONSES TO THE PANDEMIC, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON GOVERNANCE AND LEGAL SYSTEMS WITHIN THE EU, AND EVALUATES THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY EU INSTITUTIONS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE HEALTH CRISIS AGAINST THE STANDARDS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
438	THIS ESSAY FOCUSES ON THE DOCUMENTS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE DRAFTED BY COUNCIL OF EUROPE BODIES. IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ITS DIVERSE APPROACHES BEFORE AND AFTER THE RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN SOME EUROPEAN STATES SINCE 2010. THE BASIC STANDARDS ELABORATED ARE SUMMARIZED. ITS INFLUENCE IS ADDRESSED BOTH AT THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND AT THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN THE FIRST SENSE IT EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF THIS SOFT LAW IN THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS CASE LAW. SECONDLY IT FOCUSES IN THE WAY IT HAS CONDITIONED THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TASK OF MONITORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE OF LAW IN EU MEMBER STATES. THIS INFLUENCE BEGAN WHEN THEY WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE CANDIDATURES OF EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO JOIN THE EU AT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY BUT IT HAS KEPT INSPIRING THE COMMISION'S ACTIVITIES UNTIL THE REPORT ON RULE OF LAW ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2010.
439	TAKEN THE PREVALENCE OF INSTITUTIONALIST AND RULE OF LAW APPROACH IN THE CONTEMPORARY DEBATE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THIS PAPER INTENDS TO DISCUSS SOME THEORETICAL LIMITS OF THIS LITERATURE, EITHER POSITIVE OR NORMATIVE, MAINLY IN ITS APPLICATION TO DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT THE SPURRING OF DEVELOPMENT BASED ON RULE OF LAW PROGRAMS USUALLY ASSUMES A VERY LIMITED VIEW OF THE ROLES PLAYED BY THE LAW. ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING VIEW, THE ROLE PLAYED BY INSTITUTIONS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS RESTRICTED TO PROVIDING LEGAL PROTECTION FOR PRIVATE INVESTORS, WHO ARE ASSUMED TO BE THE CENTRAL ACTORS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THIS PAPER, HOWEVER, TAKES A DIFFERENT PATH AND TRIES TO ARGUE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL ALTERNATIVES OF ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION, WHICH GOES BEYOND AN ARRANGEMENT BASED ON CAPITAL MARKET AND ATOMIZED SHAREHOLDERS. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE BRAZILIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM: IN SPITE OF RECENT RULE OF LAW TYPE OF REFORMS IT IS STILL DEPENDENT OF A DEVELOPMENTAL BANK - BNDES. AS A CONCLUSION, THE ARTICLE SUSTAINS THAT INDEED LAW AND INSTITUTIONS MATTER FOR DEVELOPMENT, BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ALSO SEVERAL ROLES AND FUNCTIONS TO BE PLAYED BY LEGAL TOOLS, A LOT BROADER THAN IT IS SUPPOSED BY RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. A SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON A DEVELOPMENT BANK IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.
440	THE ANALYSIS OF MORE'S DECLAMATION IN RESPONSE TO LUCIAN'S TYRANNICIDE, DESPITE ITS RHETORICAL AND LITERARY CHARACTER, MAY BE USEFUL FOR DEDUCING THE IMPORTANCE THAT MORE ATTRIBUTES TO LAW, SINCE ITS EXISTENCE AND HEALTHY EFFICACY ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF TYRANNY, AS LAWS ARE CAPTIVE TO TYRANNY AND ARE SUBSTITUTED BY TERROR. TYRANNICIDE, WHICH MORE ACCEPTS AS IMPLIED IN THE CASE, AS WELL AS THE EXILING AND OVERTHROWING OF THE TYRANT, ARE MERITORIOUS ONLY WHEN THEY ALLOW THE CITY'S RECOVERY OF FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW.
441	IN THE RULE OF LAW THE JUDICIARY POWER IS POSITIONED ON THE SAME LEVEL THAN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS. THIS IS SO BECAUSE OF ITS INDEPENDENCE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT FROM THE DOCTRINAL POINT OF VIEW WHILE ANALYZING THE REGULATION OF THE 2009 BOLIVIAN CONSTITUTION ON THE SUBJECT.
442	JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING IS AN ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL CHECK ON AGENCY POWER. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DRAMATICALLY REVISED ITS REGULATIONS, GREATLY INSULATING ITS DECISION MAKING IN THE IMMIGRATION ARENA FROM PUBLIC AND FEDERAL COURT SCRUTINY. THESE "STREAMLINING" RULES, CARRIED OUT IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION REFORM, HAVE LED TO A BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION REVIEW. WHILE MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S RECENT ATTEMPTS TO SHIELD EXECUTIVE POWER FROM THE REACH OF CONGRESS, ITS EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE JUDICIAL REVIEW HAVE SO FAR ESCAPED SUCH SCRUTINY. YET THE STREAMLINING RULES HAVE HAD FAR-REACHING DOCTRINAL AND PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES. THEY HAVE LED TO CHAOS AT THE AGENCY, WHERE THE EMPHASIS IN IMMIGRATION ADJUDICATION HAS EXPLICITLY SHIFTED AWAY FROM RELIANCE ON STANDARDS AND PRECEDENTS TOWARDS INCREASED RELIANCE ON DISCRETIONARY, AND OFTEN ARBITRARY, DECISION MAKING. IMMIGRATION APPEALS HAVE FLOODED THE FEDERAL COURTS, NEARLY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF SOME CIRCUIT CASELOADS, WHILE TRAPPING THE COURTS IN A DOCTRINAL QUANDARY BETWEEN COMPETING DUTIES OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AND AGENCY DEFERENCE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IF LEFT UNCHECKED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S STREAMLINING REFORMS WILL UNDERMINE JUDICIAL REVIEW TURNING IT IN SOME CASES INTO AN ILLUSORY EXERCISE INCAPABLE OF RESTRAINING AGENCY ACTION. THIS WEAKENING OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IS UNWARRANTED AND UNWISE. TO HELP STEM THIS EROSION, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES MORE NUANCED INTERPRETATIONS OF DEFERENCE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW PRINCIPLES THAT CAN RESOLVE THE DILEMMAS FACING THE FEDERAL COURTS AND HELP PRESERVE THE VITALITY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OVER AGENCY DECISIONS.
443	LIKE DOMESTIC LAW, INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN BE USED IN DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE, WHERE IT CAN BECOME AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT ASSISTING CHINA'S PARTY AND GOVERNMENT TO RULE THE COUNTRY AND MANAGE STATE AFFAIRS. INCORPORATING PART OF INTERNATIONAL LAW INTO DOMESTIC LAW AND COMPREHENSIVELY ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN ACCORD WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY DEMONSTRATE THE OPENNESS AND INTERNATIONAL VISION OF CHINA'S RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION. TRANSLATING THESE PROPOSITIONS INTO CONCRETE INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE WILL BE OF VITAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR IMPROVING THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, ADVANCING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND PROMOTING WORLD PEACE.
444	IN THE RULE OF LAW THE JUDICIARY POWER IS POSITIONED ON THE SAME LEVEL THAN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS. THIS IS SO BECAUSE OF ITS INDEPENDENCE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT FROM THE DOCTRINAL POINT OF VIEW WHILE ANALYZING THE REGULATION OF THE 2009 BOLIVIAN CONSTITUTION ON THE SUBJECT.
445	A CENTRAL CHALLENGE OF POST-CONFLICT RECOVERY IS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF STATE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH OFTEN EMERGE FROM WAR DESTROYED OR OTHERWISE UNABLE TO CARRY OUT CORE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. BUT SCHOLARSHIP ON INTERNATIONAL PEACEBUILDING AND POST-CONFLICT POLITICS TENDS TO FOCUS NARROWLY ON THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE STATE, THE STATE-SYSTEM, TO THE NEGLECT OF ANOTHER CRITICAL DIMENSION: THE STATE-IDEA, OR ITS SYMBOLIC AND NORMATIVE AUTHORITY. HOW DO INTERNATIONALLY BACKED INSTITUTION-BUILDING EFFORTS SHAPE THE IDEATIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE FOLLOWING CONFLICT? DRAWING ON ORIGINAL INTERVIEWS AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH FROM POSTWAR GUATEMALA, THIS ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HOW, PARADOXICALLY, POSTWAR PEACEBUILDING AND RULE OF LAW INITIATIVES THAT SOUGHT TO STRENGTHEN THE CAPACITY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE AS A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. SPECIFICALLY, THE UNITED NATIONS' INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION AGAINST IMPUNITY IN GUATEMALA (CICIG), IN SEEKING TO COMBAT STATE-BASED CRIMINAL STRUCTURES AND BOLSTER INSTITUTIONS, TRANSFORMED LONG-HELD CONCEPTIONS OF GUATEMALA'S "WEAK" OR "FAILED" STATE INTO AN ALTERNATIVE VISION OF THE STATE AS A POWERFUL COMPLEX OF CLANDESTINE, PREDATORY NETWORKS, AND PRACTICES. IN CONJURING THE STATE AS A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT APPROPRIATES THE FORMAL ORGANS OF POLITICAL POWER FOR ILLICIT ENDS, THIS INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING INITIATIVE GENERATED A COHERENT AND DURABLE STATE-IDEA THAT BELIES KEY ADVANCES IN INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. OVERALL, THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO GROWING DEBATES ABOUT THE UNINTENDED, DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL STATEBUILDING EFFORTS BY DEMONSTRATING HOW DISTINCT IDEAS OF STATE POWER COME TO FILL THE VOID BETWEEN STATE CAPACITY AND LEGITIMACY.
446	THE SOPHIST PROTAGORAS IS FAMOUS FOR BEING THE FIRST CONSISTENT RELATIVIST WHO ARGUED THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND EVERY PERCEPTION IS VALID FOR THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE IT. HE EXTENDED THIS RELATIVISM TO MORALITY AND POLITICS AND MAINTAINED THAT THE LAW IS "THE OPINION OF THE CITY", THUS DISJOINING JUSTICE FROM ANY METAPHYSICAL FOUNDATION. HOWEVER, IF WE READ PROTAGORAS' "GREAT SPEECH" IN PLATO'S PROTAGORAS WE FIND THAT HIS ARGUMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL MEN POSSESS THE TWO POLITICAL VIRTUES LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT DEMOCRACY IS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT PROTAGORAS WAS NOT INCONSISTENT. HIS RELATIVISM IS CONFINED TO HIS THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE. IN PRACTICAL MATTERS, HUMAN BEINGS DEVISE THEIR VALUES AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH A DIALOGIC PROCESS. THIS IS THE ALL-IMPORTANT ROLE OF LOGOS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE ACCORDING TO PROTAGORAS: THROUGH THEIR INTERACTIONS, HUMAN BEINGS EXCHANGE INFORMATION WHICH ENABLES THEM TO SHAPE THE MOST JUST INSTITUTIONS AND MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS. DEMOCRACY IS THUS THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT BEST ALLOWS CITIZENS TO HAVE A PUBLIC DISCOURSE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING. THIS IS THE VALUE OF ISEGORIA AND PARRHESIA WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ISONOMIA, ARE THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY. PROTAGORAS' POSITION, THUS INTERPRETED, CAN SERVE AS A " LIBERAL" FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY. INDEED, HIS VIEW ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND KNOWLEDGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF LIBERALISM IN CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS SUCH AS FRIEDRICH VON HAYEK AND MICHAEL OAKESHOTT.
447	IN THIS PAPER WE COMPARE TWO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS-THE LEGAL AND THE SCIENTIFIC-IN WHICH THE CONCEPT OF LAW IS PROMINENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE ACUTE PHILOSOPHICAL AWARENESS, IN THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD, OF THE DIFFICULTIES SURROUNDING THE LAW CONCEPT IN THE SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT, AND THE VARIOUS RESPONSES TO THESE DIFFICULTIES, ARE ROOTED IN AN EARLIER TRADITION OF JURISPRUDENTIAL CONCERNS OVER THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL LAW IN ITS LEGAL SENSE. WE SEEK TO SHOW, FURTHER, THAT EACH ONE OF THE VARIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL LAW (IN BOTH OF ITS SENSES) IS EMBEDDED IN A METAPHYSICAL AND THEOLOGICAL CONTEXT, SO THAT DIFFERENT VISIONS OF GOD YIELD DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF THE MEANING OF THE NATURAL LAW IDIOM IN SCIENCE AS WELL AS LEGAL THEORY.
448	WE BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE STANDARD THEORY OF GROWTH AND THE MOSTLY STATIC THEORY OF CORRUPTION. SOME PUBLIC INVESTMENT CAN BE DIVERTED FROM ITS PURPOSE BY CORRUPT INDIVIDUALS. VOTERS DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT SUBJECT TO AN INCENTIVE CONSTRAINT EQUALIZING THE RETURNS FROM PRODUCTIVE AND CORRUPT ACTIVITIES. WE CONCENTRATE ON TWO EXOGENOUS INSTITUTIONAL PARAMETERS: THE "TECHNOLOGY OF CORRUPTION" IS THE EASE WITH WHICH RENT-SEEKERS CAN CAPTURE A PROPORTION OF PUBLIC SPENDING. THE "CONCENTRATION OF POLITICAL POWER" IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH RENT-SEEKERS HAVE MORE POLITICAL INFLUENCE THAN OTHER PEOPLE. ONE THEORETICAL PREDICTION IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE TWO INSTITUTIONAL PARAMETERS ON INCOME GROWTH AND EQUILIBRIUM CORRUPTION ARE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO THE CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE BINDING AT EQUILIBRIUM. IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT OF JUDICIAL QUALITY ON GROWTH SHOULD BE STRONGER WHEN POLITICAL POWER IS CONCENTRATED. WE ESTIMATE A SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS WHERE BOTH CORRUPTION AND INCOME GROWTH ARE DETERMINED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SHOW THAT INCOME GROWTH IS MORE AFFECTED BY OUR PROXIES FOR LEGAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN COUNTRIES WHERE POLITICAL RIGHTS AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, ARE LIMITED.
449	THIS ARTICLE REVISES AND UPDATES A SEMINAL ARTICLE WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR IN 1998, WHICH WAS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO TALLY HOW MANY AND WHAT KIND OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS EXISTED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IT CONTAINED A CHART THAT PLACED INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS IN A LARGER CONTEXT, LISTING THEM ALONGSIDE QUASI-JUDICIAL BODIES, IMPLEMENTATION-CONTROL AND OTHER DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODIES. THE PRESENT ARTICLE HAS THREE AIMS. THE FIRST IS TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE, SINCE SEVERAL NEW BODIES HAVE BEEN CREATED OR HAVE BECOME ACTIVE IN THE LAST DECADE. THE SECOND AIM IS A BIT MORE AMBITIOUS. IT IS TIME TO REVISE SOME OF THE CATEGORIES AND CRITERIA OF CLASSIFICATION USED BACK IN 1998. MORE THAN A DECADE OF SCHOLARSHIP IN THE FIELD BY LEGAL SCHOLARS AND POLITICAL SCIENTISTS HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON. THE ABUNDANCE OF DATA OVER A SUFFICIENTLY LONG TIME-SPAN IS MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO START MOVING AWAY FROM A MERE 'FOLK TAXONOMY' TOWARDS A MORE RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION. THE HALLMARK OF TRULY SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS IS THAT CLASSIFYING IS ONLY THE FINAL STEP OF A PROCESS, AND A CLASSIFICATION ONLY THE MEANS TO COMMUNICATE THE END RESULTS. BESIDES MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO DISCOVER AND DESCRIBE, SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS CRUCIALLY ENABLE PREDICTION OF NEW ENTITIES AND CATEGORIES. THUS, THE THIRD AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ATTEMPT TO DISCERN SOME TRENDS AND MAKE SOME PREDICTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS INCREASINGLY RELEVANT FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS.
450	ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN BOBBIO'S THOUGHT WAS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS. BOBBIO SAW LAW AS INSTITUTIONAL, A HUMAN ARTEFACT. AS I SEE IT, IT IS THIS RECOGNITION OF THE ARTIFICIAL NATURE OF LAW WHICH LARGELY EXPLAINS THE FASCINATION THAT HOBBES INSPIRED IN HIM THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. IT IS TRUE, HOWEVER, THAT BOBBIO NEVER FACED UP TO THE FULL CONSEQUENCES OF THE HOBBESIAN CHALLENGE. HE ALWAYS GAVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION TO FOLLOW A NATURALISTIC OR KANTIAN TENDENCY, WHICH LED HIM TO GIVE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO A PRE-EXISTING LAW THAN TO POLITICS. HOWEVER, IF HOBBES 'CHALLENGE IS STRONG, THIS CANNOT BE THE CASE. THE CHALLENGE CAN ONLY BE OVERCOME IF WE SEE LAW AS BEING THE RESULT OF SOME KIND OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. IF THIS IS SO, THE RULES OF THE DEMOCRATIC GAME SHOULD BE SEEN MORE AS RULES INHERENT IN A SOCIETY AND IN A DEMOCRATIC PRAXIS THAN AS PREEXISTING LEGAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS.
451	THIS ARTICLE BUILDS UPON THE OBSERVATION THAT POLITICAL RULERS HAVE TO RELY UPON ADMINISTRATORS TO IMPLEMENT THEIR POLICY DECISIONS TO UNCOVER TWO MECHANISMS BY WHICH LEGAL LIMITS, UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, CAN BE SELF-ENFORCING. WE SHOW HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH LEGAL LIMITS DEPENDS ON ADMINISTRATORS' EXPECTATION THAT RIGHTS VIOLATIONS MIGHT BE COSTLY IN THE FUTURE, WHEN THE CURRENT RULER'S GRIP ON POWER ENDS. WE ALSO SHOW HOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL LIMITS DEPENDS ON ADMINISTRATORS' EXPECTATION ABOUT EACH OTHERS' ACTIONS WHEN ASKED TO EXECUTE AN ILLEGAL POLICY, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS MIGHT INDUCE COMPLIANCE BY MAKING A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR SALIENT. THE ANALYSIS CONTRIBUTES TO A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH LAW CAN EFFECTIVELY LIMIT THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT.
452	RESTRUCTURING SOVEREIGN DEBT HAS LONG PROVED CHALLENGING: THERE IS NO FORMAL REGIME FOR SOVEREIGN INSOLVENCIES SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT THAT GOVERN DOMESTIC BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY AND ATTEMPTS TO CREATE ONE BY INTERNATIONAL TREATY HAVE BEEN MET WITH POLITICAL RESISTANCE. CURRENTLY, SOVEREIGN DEBT RESTRUCTURING IS GOVERNED BY THE DEBT CONTRACTS THEMSELVES ALONG WITH THE BACKGROUND LAW IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE DEBT IS ISSUED. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY ALSO PROTECTS MOST STATE ASSETS FROM SEIZURE. THESE AD HOC RESTRUCTURING PROCESSES ARE PLAGUED BY UNPREDICTABILITY, HOWEVER, AND THERE ARE INCENTIVES FOR INDIVIDUAL CREDITORS TO "HOLD OUT," DEMANDING FULL REPAYMENT OF THEIR CLAIMS AND THEREBY UNDERMINING A NECESSARY RESTRUCTURING. JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN RECENT YEARS REGARDING DEBT GOVERNED BY NEW YORK LAW HAVE ONLY STRENGTHENED THE HAND OF THESE HOLDOUT CREDITORS. WHILE MODIFICATIONS TO STANDARD TERMS IN SOVEREIGN DEBT CONTRACTS CAN GO SOME WAY TOWARDS IMPROVING THE CURRENT SITUATION, THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT A SUPERIOR OPTION IS THE ADOPTION OF A MODEL LAW ON SOVEREIGN DEBT RESTRUCTURING BY AT LEAST ONE APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION. UNDER THE MODEL LAW APPROACH, SOVEREIGNS COULD ISSUE DEBT IN A JURISDICTION THAT HAS ENACTED A LAW PROVIDING FOR A FAIR, ORDERLY, AND PREDICTABLE RESTRUCTURING IN THE EVENT THAT A SOVEREIGN'S DEBT BECOMES UNSUSTAINABLE. DUE TO ITS WELL-DEVELOPED FINANCIAL MARKETS AND REPUTATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT ONTARIO, SUPPORTED BY CANADA, WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE JURISDICTION TO ENACT SUCH A LAW. THIS ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT A COLLABORATIVE LEGISLATIVE APPROACH BETWEEN ONTARIO AND FEDERAL PARLIAMENT WOULD BEST ENSURE THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY, AND THEREFORE STABILITY, OF THIS NOVEL AND INNOVATIVE PROPOSED REGIME.
453	THIS PAPER STUDIES THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DEMOCRATIZATION AND THE EMERGENCE OF RULE OF LAW. WE PROPOSE A MODEL IN WHICH HETEROGENEOUS INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE COSTLY INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT THEIR INCOME AGAINST EXPROPRIATION. THE PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IS CHOSEN BY THE ENFRANCHISED POPULATION WHOSE COMPOSITION DEPENDS ON THE POLITICAL REGIME IN PLACE. WE CHARACTERIZE THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC EQUILIBRIA IN TERMS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND POLITICAL REGIME, AND STUDY THE ROLE OF THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF DEMOCRATIZATION. THE RESULTS SUGGEST: (I) UNEQUAL CONTROL OF NATURAL RESOURCES IS A CENTRAL STRUCTURAL DETERMINANT OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION SCENARIO; (II) DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS UNDER CONFLICT MAY LEAD TO FAILED DEMOCRACIES WITH POOR RULE OF LAW; (III) THAT DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS SUPPORTED BY A LARGE CONSENSUS MAY SERVE AS A COORDINATION DEVICE THEREBY LEADING TO BETTER PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND MORE STABLE POLITIES.
454	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIOLENCE, LAW AND BORDERS BY ANALYZING BOTH THE VIOLENCE AT THE BORDERS AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE BORDERS. IN BOTH CASES, THE AUTHOR STATES THAT VIOLENCE EXERTED BY MEANS OF LAW, AS WELL AS MIGRATORY AND ASYLUM POLICIES, THREATEN THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND CANNOT BE SEEN AS EXERCISING THE LEGITIMATE MONOPOLY OF FORCE, RESULTING IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
455	ONE OF THE LEGACIES OF THE SOVIET ERA IS CONTINUED LOW LEVELS OF PUBLIC TRUST IN THE LITHUANIAN COURTS. THE PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED BY THE NEED FOR GREATER COMPETENCY AND HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR JUDGES. MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TO REDRESS THESE PROBLEMS, BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE JUDICIAL ARENA THUS FAR HAS BEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THE COURT HAS DEMONSTRABLY STRENGTHENED THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURT SYSTEM. AT THE SAME RIME IT HAS EXTENDED HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR THE LAW.
456	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER INDIVIDUALS' HIGHER MORAL VALUES STEMMING FROM HIGHER RELIGIOSITY LEAD TO HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. BASED ON THE DATA FROM WORLD VALUES SURVEY (WVS, 1980-2014) WITH 343,440 RESPONDENTS, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT HIGHER RELIGIOSITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER JUSTIFIABILITY OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOR SUCH AS CHEATING ON TAXES, RECEIVING FALSE GOVERNMENT BENEFITS, AND TAKING BRIBES. HOWEVER, AT THE LEVEL OF 98 COUNTRIES FROM WHICH THE RESPONDENTS IN THE WVS STEM, HIGHER RELIGIOSITY SEEMS TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AS MEASURED IN CORRUPTION CONTROL, EXECUTIVE CONSTRAINTS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, HIGHER RELIGIOSITY AND MORAL STANDARDS AT THE RESPONDENT LEVEL MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO HIGHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. WE DISCUSS POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS DISCREPANCY.
457	ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU) SOLEMNLY PROCLAIMS THAT THE EU IS FOUNDED ON THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, EQUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. YET, A GROWING BODY OF CASE LAW CONCERNING RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING CONTINUOUSLY REMINDS US OF THE LACK OF A DEDICATED FUNCTIONAL MECHANISM TO REMEDY THIS. WE ARE LEFT WITH A FRAGMENTED UNDERSTANDING OF THE FOUNDING VALUES AND A PATCHY FRAMEWORK FOR THEIR ENFORCEMENT: WHILST THERE IS INCREASING GUIDANCE ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW, NO FOUNDING VALUE HAS BEEN DEFINED COMPREHENSIVELY. THE LEGAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOUNDING VALUES IS EQUALLY UNCLEAR, AS IS THEIR POSITION IN THE EU'S CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THIS PAPER MAKES DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE, TO OFFER SYSTEMATIC, NORMATIVE, AND SUBSTANTIVE CLARIFICATIONS ON ARTICLE 2 TEU. SYSTEMATICALLY, IT PLACES THE FOUNDING VALUES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF THE EU'S AND MEMBER STATES' LEGAL ORDERS AND DISCUSSES THEIR AUTONOMY, INTERPRETATION, AND FUNCTION. NORMATIVELY, THIS PAPER OBJECTS TO THE DIRECT ENFORCEMENT OF THE FOUNDING VALUES BY REFERENCE TO THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE AND OVER-CONSTITUTIONALIZATION. SUBSTANTIVELY, IT FAVORS THE INDIRECT ENFORCEMENT OF THE FOUNDING VALUES AND EXPLORES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ARTICLE 2 TEU AND OTHER TREATY PROVISIONS.
458	CLIMATE CHANGE IS A PERSISTENT, PERVASIVE AND PERNICIOUS PROBLEM. EACH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE JUDICIARY, HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE. COURTS CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION BY: PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE; DETERMINING AND NOT DEFERRING CLIMATE CHANGE CLAIMS; UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW; TAKING AND FORCING THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATURE AND PRIVATE SECTOR TO TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY; EXPLAINING AND UPHOLDING THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES UNDERPINNING THE LAW; PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES AND PUTTING A PRICE ON THEM; ASSISTING THE PROGRESSIVE AND PRINCIPLED DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE LAW AND POLICY; AND MAKING REASONED AND EVIDENCE-BASED DECISIONS.
459	IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR RECONSTRUCTS FRANCESCO VIOLA'S THOUGHT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICS AND GLOBALIZATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS. BALLESTEROS PRESENTS VIOLA'S ARGUMENTATION BY HIGHLIGHTING FIVE ALTERNATIVES IN PRACTICAL REASONING AND LEGAL THEORY: A) MORAL OBJECTIVITY VS. SUBJECTIVE PREFERENCES, B) POLITICAL PLURALISM VS. ECONOMIC UNIFORMITY, C) FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS VS. VENALITY, D) COOPERATION VS. ZERO- SUM GAME, E) RULE OF LAW BASED GLOBALIZATION VS. ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION.
460	THE PRESENT WORK EXAMINES THE ROLE OF PERSUASIVE LEXICON IN LEGAL DISCOURSE THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF EMOTIONAL DEVICES AT A LEXICAL AND RHETORICAL LEVEL. OUR PRELIMINARY PREMISE IS THAT EMOTION IS DEPLOYED BY EXPERTS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SHARED VALUES AND EPISTEMIC TRUST: THE NEED TO RELY ON THE TENETS OF THE LAW AS FAIR AND CONDUCIVE TO THE COMMON GOOD. THE CORPUS OF OUR STUDY IS CONSTITUTED BY THE CONCLUSIONS IN THEIR ORIGINAL SPANISH, AND THEIR TRANSLATION INTO ENGLISH, BY THE ADVOCATE GENERAL MANUEL CAMPOS ON THE CHALLENGE BY HUNGARY AND POLAND OF THE REGULATION ESTABLISHING A "CONDITIONALITY REGIME" IN THE EVENT OF A RULE-OF-LAW BREACH IN A EU MEMBER STATE. TO THIS END, WE UNDERTAKE A TWO-PRONGED ANALYSIS OF LEGAL PERSUASION TO FIND OUT WHAT EMOTIONAL DEVICES ARE DEPLOYED TO CONVEY THE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE, NON-DISCRIMINATION, EQUALITY AND SOLIDARITY. AT A FIRST STAGE, WE CONCENTRATE UPON THE POLARITY AND INTENSITY OF EMOTION WORDS AND THEIR CATEGORIES. EMOTIONAL IMPLICATURES IN THE SHAPE OF LEGAL TECHNOLECTS AND METAPHORICAL ONTOLOGIES AND THE WAY THEY ARE DEPLOYED IN EACH TEXT CONSTITUTES THE SECOND PART OF OUR STUDY. AMONG OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT BOTH THE ORIGINAL AND TARGET TEXTS HAVE A STRONG PERSUASIVE CHARACTER, MAINLY GROUNDED IN THE NEGATIVE EMOTION OF FEAR AND THE POSITIVE EMOTION OF TRUST, AND THAT THERE ARE VARIANCES IN THE EMOTIONAL LANGUAGE DEPLOYED IN EITHER VERSION DUE TO THE DIFFERENT MECHANICS OF EACH LAW SYSTEM AND TO FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ENGLISH AND SPANISH.
461	DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST STATES OF CENTRAL EUROPE TOOK PLACE DURING THE "THIRD WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION" (HUNTINGTON). IT WAS A REMARKABLY ORDERLY PROCESS, RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT AND CONSOLIDATION OF NEW DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. IN THIS RESPECT CENTRAL EUROPE, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF ITS CULTURAL IDENTITY AS PART OF THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION, DIFFERED POSITIVELY FROM MOST OF THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS AND FROM THE BALKANS. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, NEW AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, BASED ON FREE ELECTION BUT ABOLISHING THE RULE OF LAW, HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, MOSTLY DUE TO THE DISSATISFACTION OF THE POORER STRATA WITH THE EFFECTS OF SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION.
462	THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT GUIDELINES FOR LAW REFORM PROCESSES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CHALLENGES THAT TERRORISM MAY POSE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. AS A RESPONSE TO TERRORISM, AN INCREASE IN REFORMS OF LAWS AND ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES HAS BEEN SEEN ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. THE SUBSTANTIVE OFFENSES THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED, BUT AS OF YET, THE THEORETICAL ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE DURING PROCESSES OF REFORM HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED. HOWEVER, LAW REFORM AS A DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO SUCH EVENTS MAY CURTAIL THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY: THERE MAY BE INADEQUATE TIME FOR DEBATE IN THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING PROPOSED MEASURES, OR THE DEBATE MAY BE CENTERED ON ARGUMENTS BASED ON FEAR AND HATE TOWARD PERPETRATORS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS MAY CURTAIL INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY OF CITIZENS AND TRUNCATE DEMOCRACY. IT SETS OUT GUIDELINES FOR HOW PROCESSES OF LAW REFORM MAY TREAT PEOPLE AS CAPABLE OF SELF-MODERATION.
463	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY PLAYS AMONGST THE EMPIRICAL DRIVERS OF INCOME INEQUALITY IN AFRICA. USING A DYNAMIC TWO-STEP DIFFERENCE GMM WITH ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS OVER THE PERIOD 1990-2017, WE FIND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS IN GENERAL, ON INCOME INEQUALITY. HOWEVER, WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS SUCH AS CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND THE STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INCOME INEQUALITY. WE ALSO FIND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF THE OTHER INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND POLITICAL STABILITY ON INCOME INEQUALITY IN OUR SAMPLE. WE SUGGEST THAT MORE PREMIUM BE PLACED ON CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE STRINGENT ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN ENSURING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME IN AFRICA. FURTHERMORE, WE RE-ECHO SUGGESTIONS THAT PROMOTE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA AS INSTITUTIONS IN GENERAL REMAIN VERY WEAK.
464	SPEAKING OF SEXUAL CONSENT IN CHILDREN OLDER THAN 14 YEARS, FACES THREE POSITIONS: THE GUARANTOR IN A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE ART OF DECEPTION IN HEAD ABUSERS, AND A DEFORMATION OF THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM AND SELF-CARE FOR THE HOLDER OF SUCH RIGHT, AND REASON WHOSE BODY IS ALSO UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
465	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS IN SERBIA AND CAMBODIA. IN BOTH COUNTRIES, THEY EMERGED WITH THE CONCEPTUAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES; YET, THE OUTPUTS WERE MEDIATED BY THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS. STILL, THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE SOME JOINT FEATURES: THEY (1) BOOST BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND AWARENESS RATHER THAN SOLELY MOBILIZING SOCIAL INTERESTS; (2) TARGET THE INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS RATHER THAN THE INTERESTS OF SOCIAL-BASED GROUPS OR CLASSES; (3) PROMOTE STATE COOPERATION INSTEAD OF CONFRONTATION AND (3) INSIST ON THE USE OF TECHNICAL POLICY-RELATED TOOLS AND MECHANISMS INSTEAD OF POLITICAL MOBILIZATION. THE SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY INITIATIVES ANALYZED HERE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY-NOT-POLITICS OR DEPOLITICIZED APPROACH. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THEY WERE INEFFECTIVE IN MOBILIZING CITIZENS AND SOCIAL GROUPS IN A MANNER THAT WOULD EFFICIENTLY DEMAND MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, GOVERNMENTS CONTESTED CIVIL SOCIETY AND APPROPRIATED ITS ACCOUNTABILITY DISCOURSES AND STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT THAT CAN BE READ AS AN ATTEMPT TO RESIST IMPOSING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW AND PACIFYING PRESENT AND FUTURE CIVIC ACTIVISM.
466	ON JUNE 11, 2018, THEN-ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS RELEASED HIS DECISION IN A CASE CALLED MATTER OF A-B-, PURPORTING TO ELIMINATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND GANG VIOLENCE AS GROUNDS FOR ASYLUM. THE DECISION ALSO CAST DOUBT ON THE CONTINUED VIABILITY OF ASYLUM CLAIMS PREDICATED ON NON-STATE ACTOR VIOLENCE, WHICH ALARMED LGBTQ ADVOCATES, WHOSE ASYLUM CLAIMS OFTEN INVOLVE NON-STATE ACTOR PERSECUTORS. IN MAKING THIS CHANGE, SESSIONS USED A PREVIOUSLY RARELY USED FEATURE OF THE ASYLUM SYSTEM, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S SELF-CERTIFICATION POWER. THIS NOTE ANALYZES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MATTER OF A-B- ON LGBTQ ASYLUM SEEKERS. BASED ON THE TEXT OF THE DECISION, MATTER OF A-B- SHOULD HAVE A LESS EXTREME IMPACT ON LGBTQ AND OTHER ASYLUM SEEKERS THAN ADVOCATES INITIALLY FEARED. BUT THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE DECISION IS NONETHELESS ALARMING. STATISTICAL AND ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MATTER OFA-B- CONTRIBUTED TO RECORD HIGH DENIAL RATES IN 2018, AND SOME ASYLUM SEEKERS DENIED AS A RESULT IDENTIFIED AS LGBTQ. THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TEXT OF THE DECISION AND ITS PRACTICAL IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL DEEPLY TROUBLING FEATURES OF THE U.S. ASYLUM SYSTEM, INCLUDING THE BROAD DISCRETION AFFORDED TO ADJUDICATORS AND LACK OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. BECAUSE OF THESE FACTORS, WHEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL USES HIS SELF-CERTIFICATION POWER IN THE ASYLUM CONTEXT, ONE PERSON HAS VAST POWER TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES TO A PROCESS WITH LIFE AND DEATH STAKES, A LEVEL OF POWER THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE NORMS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT UNDERPIN OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THIS NOTE ARGUES THAT THE CASE STUDY OF MATTER OF A-B- AND ITS IMPACT ON LGBTQ ASYLUM CLAIMS REVEALS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE U.S. ASYLUM SYSTEM.
467	THIS IS A REVIEW, FROM A SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE, OF LAW-RELATED TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE FORMERLY COMMUNIST PARTS OF EUROPE. IT DRAWS PARTICULARLY ON DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST CENTRAL EUROPE. THE FRAME OF THE DISCUSSION IS A SPECIFIC AND INTERRELATED GROUP OF QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THESE TRANSFORMATIONS, TO WHAT EXTENT DO THESE FEATURES ENDURE, AND WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE POSTCOMMUNIST REGION HAS ENTERED A NEW PHASE? THE REVIEW DISCUSSES THE UTILITY OF THE CONCEPTS "POSTCOMMUNISM" AND "TRANSITION"; THE GOAL OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN THE NAME OF WHICH MANY LEGAL REFORMS HAVE BEEN MADE; PARTICULAR PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN RELATION TO THE JUDICIARY, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, AND FORMER SECRET POLICE; AND QUESTIONS ABOUT "DEALING WITH THE PAST" AS THEY HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT PAST INSTITUTIONS, PEOPLE, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. IT CONCLUDES WITH A CONSIDERATION OF THE LIKELY IMPACT OF "JOINING EUROPE" ON THOSE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AS MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ON THOSE THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ACCEPTED, AND ON THOSE THAT ARE UNLIKELY EVER TO BE ACCEPTED.
468	THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE ORIGINS, THE ORGANIZATION, THE MEMBERSHIP AND THE ROLE OF THE VENICE COMMISSION AND EXAMINES ITS CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL CONSTITUTION-MAKING, THE ANALYSIS BEING SITUATED WITHIN THE LITERATURE CONCERNING TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE OVER-ESTIMATED, ONE SHOULD NOT UNDER-ESTIMATE EITHER THE IMPACT OF THE VENICE COMMISSION IN CONSOLIDATING AND STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW IN THOSE COUNTRIES WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICES OF THE COMMISSION.
469	AS THE ULTIMATE RULE OF A LEGAL SYSTEM, A RULE OF RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES VIEWED AS THE EQUIVALENT OF A NATION'S CONSTITUTION. THEORETICALLY AND OPERATIVELY, HOWEVER, CONSTITUTIONS AND RULES OF RECOGNITION ARE NOT, AND CANNOT BE, THE SAME THING. BY EMPLOYING DEPARTMENTALISM THE THEORY THAT EACH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO INTERPRET ITS NATIONAL CONSTITUTION FOR ITSELF AS A CHALLENGE TO THE RESPECTIVE RULES OF RECOGNITION IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES FUNDAMENTAL COMMITMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN BOTH NATIONS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE CHALLENGES WIDESPREAD ASSUMPTIONS AND ASSERTIONS ABOUT JUDICIAL SUPREMACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE CLARIFIES ERRORS MADE BY PROMINENT CONSTITUTIONAL THEORISTS AND HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ANGLO-AMERICAN RULE OF LAW VALUES AS THESE HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, IDENTIFIED BY THE RULE(S) OF RECOGNITION WITHIN AND ACROSS THESE LEGAL SYSTEMS.
470	ACROSS LATIN AMERICA, SOCIETIES ARE CONFRONTING THE RISE OF NOVEL ORDERS IN WHICH STATE OFFICIALS AND POLITICAL AUTHORITIES SHARE POWER WITH CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS. CRIMINAL GOVERNANCE (I.E., THE CREATION OF RULES REGULATING BEHAVIOR BY CRIMINAL ENTITIES OFTEN WITH THE COLLABORATION OF STATE ACTORS), AS THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE COME TO BE KNOWN, POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND OFTEN THREATENS PEOPLES' ENJOYMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON STATE-CRIMINAL RELATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA BY CRITICALLY DISCUSSING CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES. IN SO DOING, IT LOOKS AT THREE EXTANT LITERATURES THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ENHANCING OUR GRASP OF ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF GOVERNANCE: STUDIES ON VIOLENCE, WORKS ON STATENESS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE LITERATURE ON CRIMINAL GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT THOSE LITERATURES HAVE DONE A COMMENDABLE JOB IN DESCRIBING AND CONCEPTUALIZING EMERGING FORMS OF GOVERNANCE THAT DEVIATE FROM TRADITIONAL VIEWS. HOWEVER, WE ALSO ARGUE THAT THESE BODIES OF WORK OPERATE IN SILOS WITH LITTLE INTEGRATION AND DISPLAY METHODOLOGICAL BIASES AND THEORETICAL BLIND SPOTS THAT WEAKEN THEIR OVERALL ANALYTICAL POWER. WE ALSO POINT OUT THAT MUCH MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO ASSESS THESE NEW ORDERS' CONSEQUENCES FOR EXISTING POLITICAL REGIMES AND STATE INSTITUTIONS. IN THE CONCLUSION, WE PROPOSE CONCRETE STEPS TO STRENGTHEN RESEARCH AND FOSTER A MORE INTEGRATED AGENDA AND SUGGEST FUTURE INVESTIGATIVE AVENUES.
471	A NEW REEF THE LUXURY CRUISE SHIP 'RULE OF LAW' HAS HIT, CALLED THE UNENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT INSTEAD OF THE OFTEN MISNAMED AND MISUNDERSTOOD SCAPEGOAT, THE 'CHINA MODEL', IT IS TWO GLOBAL TRENDS, THE INTERNET AND OUTSOURCING, THAT HAVE LED TO THE HISTORICAL CLASHING AND OVERCOMING OF THE LAW. AS A RESULT, IMPORTANT REVISIONS TO OUR CONCEPTION AND USE OF THE LAW AND A NEW FAITH IN UNIVERSALISM MUST BE CONTEMPLATED.
472	AMONG THE PROTEST MOVEMENTS SWEEPING THE REGION IN THE ARAB AWAKENING OF 2011, THE EGYPTIAN REVOLT IS THE MOVEMENT THAT IS PERHAPS MOST DEFINED BY A STRUGGLE OVER THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW MORE GENERALLY. I ARGUE THAT THIS INTENSE FOCUS ON LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IS A LEGACY OF THE PROMINENT ROLE THAT LAW PLAYED IN MAINTAINING AUTHORITARIAN RULE IN MUBARAK'S EGYPT. JUST AS LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WERE THE PRINCIPAL MECHANISMS UNDERGIRDING AUTHORITARIAN RULE, OPPOSITION ACTIVISTS KNOW THAT DEMOCRACY CAN ONLY EMERGE THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL REFORM. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STRUGGLE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL POWER IN THREE PERIODS - BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE EGYPTIAN REVOLT OF 2011.
473	THE ANALYSES OF THE POLITIZATION PRACTICE OF THE SUBALTERNS CLASS, BY THEORISTS OF THE CHILEAN TRANSITION, HAVE BEEN MADE UNDER THE PREMISES OF THE POLITICAL IMMUNIZATION AND THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURE OF THE VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT IMPLIED THE COUP D'ETAT. THIS RESULTED IN AN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROCESS WHICH ALLOWED TO IDENTIFY THE FAILURE OF THE POPULAR UNITY IN A FUTURE PERSPECTIVE. IN THIS PAPER, WE WILL PRESENT A THEORETICAL REFLECTION ABOUT THE RELATION BETWEEN LAW, VIOLENCE AND CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, FROM THE CRITICAL DISCOURSES ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN DEMOCRACY IN CHILE.
474	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS ARCHAEOLOGY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND GOVERNMENT THROUGH A CRITICAL APPROACH. IT DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC POLICIES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE LIVES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. IT IS ARGUED THAT DIMINISHING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES ARE A SHARED CONCERN AND PUBLIC POLICIES ARE SET UP BY DEMOCRATIC STATES TO COPE WITH THIS GOAL. THE PAPER THEN TURNS TO ARCHAEOLOGY AS A PRACTICE RESULTING FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC POLICIES. FOR THE FIRST CENTURY AND A HALF, THE DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN SCHOLARLY, ELITIST, AND OFTEN COLONIALIST. MORE RECENTLY, ARCHAEOLOGY HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CONSIDERED AS A SOCIALLY RELEVANT ENDEAVOUR IN THE AMERICAS. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN RELATED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY STRESSING THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY FOR A PROGRESSIVE ROLE FOR ARCHAEOLOGY IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE FUTURE.
475	DRIVEN BY FOOD CRISES AND CONSTRAINTS ON NATURAL RESOURCES, INVESTORS ARE INCREASINGLY LEASING OR PURCHASING FARMLAND ABROAD. THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY TESTS WHICH POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS ATTRACT THESE INVESTORS. I ARGUE THAT FOOD SCARCITY CONCERNS INCENTIVIZE FOREIGN INVESTORS IN AGRICULTURE TO PRIORITIZE UNOPPOSED, QUICK DEALS ABOVE OTHER PREDICTED FACTORS SUCH AS LOW POLITICAL RISK. I THUS PREDICT THAT INVESTORS WILL INVEST IN NONDEMOCRATIC HOSTS AND HOSTS WITH WEAK LAWS TO ENSURE FAST NEGOTIATIONS, EASILY TRANSFERRED LAND, AND MINIMAL CITIZEN OPPOSITION. PANEL REGRESSIONS CORROBORATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT AND DEMOCRACY IS NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING AGRICULTURAL FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS.
476	THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUNISHMENT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE DEFENSE OF RETRIBUTIVISM AND THE DISABILITY OF CRIMINALS. NOT EVEN DURING THE TIMES OF GREATEST SOFTENING OF PENALTIES DID CRIMINAL LAW AVOIDED PUNISHMENT. FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF CRIMINAL LAW WITH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, RE-SOCIALIZATION (OF CORRECTIONALISM ORIGIN) BEGAN TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT INTO CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS AS ONE OF THE MANY PURPOSES OF PUNISHMENT. HOWEVER, THE HUMANIZED VIEW OF SPECIAL POSITIVE PREVENTION BEGINS TO LOSE STRENGTH AND NEW WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING PREVENTION BEGIN TO BREAK THROUGH. PERHAPS, THE MOST PARADIGMATIC CASE IS THAT OF DAVID KENNEDY'S CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORY: FOCUSED DETERRENCE. WE ARE FACING A KIND OF NEGATIVE GENERAL PREVENTION THAT IS NOT GENERAL, BUT CONSISTS OF LETTING SPECIFIC SUBJECTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM. THE SUCCESS THAT THIS EXPERIMENT HAS HAD IN PREVENTING CRIME HAS FOUND NUMEROUS DEFENDERS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED IT AS A GOOD TOOL TO FIGHT AGAINST CRIMINALITY. HOWEVER, NOT EVERYTHING IS ACCEPTABLE TO PREVENT CRIME AND FOCUSED DETERRENCE IS A WAY TO PREVENT CRIME THAT DOES NOT FIT WELL WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
477	MUCH POLITICAL CONFLICT IN THE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND THE ISSUE OF HOW MUCH FREEDOM TO ACCORD PEOPLE. LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY, E.G., THE RULE OF LAW AND A STRONG PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS, GIVING INDIVIDUALS A GREAT DEAL OF LEGALLY GUARANTEED FREEDOM TO LEAD THEIR LIVES AS THEY SEE FIT. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER LEGAL FREEDOM SUFFICES TO MAKE PEOPLE SATISFIED WITH FREEDOM. OUR STUDY EXPLORES THAT ISSUE BY RELATING SEVEN INDICATORS OF LEGAL FREEDOM TO THE SATISFACTION PEOPLE EXPRESS WITH THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE. USING A SAMPLE OF 133 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2008-2018, AND TAKING A PANEL-DATA APPROACH, WE FIND NO ROBUST BASELINE RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, WHEN EXPLORING CONDITIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BY INTERACTING THE INDICATORS WITH SOCIAL TRUST, THE RULE OF LAW IS POSITIVELY AND INCREASINGLY RELATED TO SATISFACTION WITH FREEDOM ABOVE AND BELOW A THRESHOLD LEVEL. FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY IS MORE POSITIVE FOR SATISFACTION WITH FREEDOM THE HIGHER THE GDP PER CAPITA AND IN DEMOCRACIES. THUS, FOR SOME TYPES OF LEGAL FREEDOM, FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLEMENTARY WITH CULTURE, INCOME AND THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN GENERATING SATISFACTION WITH FREEDOM.
478	THIS ACADEMIC WORK IS PROJECTED IN ORDER TO MAKE A MODEST APPROACH, TO THE PATH THAT CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS UNDERTAKEN IN THE SEARCH FOR A IUS COMMUNE, WHICH, ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE, COULD BE BASED ON THREE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS: THE HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND DEMOCRACY; HOWEVER, THIS ANALYSIS FOCUSES MAINLY ON THE FIRST OF THEM, IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING HOW IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IN THE MEXICAN LEGAL SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY REGARDING ITS NORMATIVE ADVANCES, AND RESISTANCE IN DAILY PRACTICE.
479	THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN POLITICS AND LAW, AND THEREFORE ALSO BETWEEN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND JURISPRUDENCE, IS IN THE FIELD OF STATE ACTION. STATE AUTHORITY ENSURES THE LAW'S MANDATORY FORCE AND EFFECTIVENESS. LAW LIMITS POLITICAL PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONALIZES HUMAN RIGHTS. THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL INTERESTS IS EXPRESSED THROUGH LEGISLATIVE POLICY, AND THE LEGAL RATIONALIZATION OF POLICY IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW.
480	MUNICIPALITIES, CITIES, REGIONS, AND THE ELECTED POLITICIANS AT THE GRASSROOTS IMPLEMENT PLURALIST DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE KEY ELEMENTS OF WHAT THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE CONSIDERS THE EUROPEAN MODEL OF SOCIETY. THIS ESSAY EXPLAINS THE ROLE AND RESPONSES OF THE CONGRESS OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES, AN ORGAN OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE NOT ONLY DEALING WITH LOCAL GOVERNANCE IN AN ABSTRACT WAY, BUT RATHER UNITING CROSSCUTTING AND HORIZONTAL EXPERIENCES FROM MAYORS, COUNCILLORS, REGIONAL PARLIAMENTARIANS, AND GOVERNMENT MEMBERS FROM 46 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF AN INTER-DISCIPLINARY CONFERENCE, THE INSTITUTIONAL, AND MULTI-LEVEL CONTEXT OF SELECTED ACTION OF MUNICIPALITIES, CITIES AND REGIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CONGRESS, IN IMPLEMENTING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE ADDRESSED. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS, NOTABLY STEPS TAKEN TO ENSURE A CONTEMPORARY APPLICATION OF THE EUROPEAN CHARTER OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, IN FORCE SINCE 1988, AND PROPOSALS TO EMPOWER LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS CURRENT CRISES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, WILL BE COVERED. THE ACTION OF THE CONGRESS IN SELECTED POLICY AREAS IS PRESENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE WITH A FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS OF THE ORGANISATION. SOME HISTORIC REFERENCES, WHICH ARE USEFUL FOR AN AUDIENCE NOT SO FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS, COMPLETE THE ESSAY.
481	PERCEPTIONS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS INFLUENCE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LAW AND BECAUSE PROCEDURES ARE MUTABLE, REFORMING THEM CAN BUTTRESS SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. YET LEGAL AUTHORITIES HAVE RECENTLY FACED A DISTINCT CHALLENGE: ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPRIETY BASED ON THEIR ASCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS (E.G., GENDER, ETHNICITY). WE STUDY THE EFFECT OF THESE TRAITS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE U.S. LEGAL SYSTEM, FOCUSING ON THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CITIZENS PERCEIVE FEMALE AND MINORITY JUDGES AS EXHIBITING IMPROPRIETY AND HOW THIS COMPARES WITH PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR WHITE AND MALE COUNTERPARTS. WE FIND THAT AMERICANS USE A JUDGE'S RACE AND GENDER TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT WHICH GROUPS THE JUDGE FAVORS, WHETHER SHE IS INHERENTLY BIASED, AND WHETHER SHE SHOULD RECUSE. NOTABLY, WE FIND DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT EVALUATIONS OF FEMALE AND HISPANIC JUDGES AMONG THE POLITICAL RIGHT AND LEFT.
482	THE CRISIS IS A GENERAL EXPRESSION OF MANY NEGATIVE MANIFESTATIONS AND CONSEQUENCES, WHICH HAVE BEEN BURDENING THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REALITY OF THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE (SEE) FOR THREE DECADES. THE INHERITED PROBLEMS FROM SOCIALISM WERE FOLLOWED BY NEW ONES, CONDITIONED BY NEOLIBERAL REFORMS. THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE KEY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW AND ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS, THE CHARACTER OF WHICH DETERMINES SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ALL COUNTRIES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO POINT OUT THE BASIC CAUSES OF THE DEVELOPMENT LAG OF THE SEE COUNTRIES. THE STARTING POINT IS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE BASIC CAUSES OF THE CRISIS ARE GENERATED IN A TRIANGLE THAT CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: PROGRAMMATICALLY WEAK FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, AND INTEREST-ORIENTED RULE OF LAW DEFICIT, AND STRONG ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT URGENT OVERCOMING OF THE MENTIONED ANTI-DEVELOPMENT LINKS IS A CONDITION FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEE COUNTRIES.
483	WHY CAN SOME GOVERNMENTS CREDIBLY COMMIT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS WHILE OTHERS CANNOT? A POTENTIAL ANSWER INVOLVES DEEP HISTORICAL TRADITIONS OF INSTITUTIONS THAT CONSTRAIN RULERS. WE EXPLORE WHETHER EXPERIENCES WITH REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLIES IN MEDIEVAL/EARLY MODERN EUROPE HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK ON INCOMES AND INSTITUTIONS TODAY. WE EMPLOY STASAVAGE'S (2010) DATA ON REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY ACTIVITY IN 30 MEDIEVAL/EARLY MODERN EUROPEAN POLITIES AND THE PUTTERMAN AND WEIL (2010) DATA ON DESCENDANCY SHARES FROM CIRCA 1500 POPULATIONS TO CONSTRUCT COUNTRY-LEVEL MEASURES OF HISTORICAL ASSEMBLY EXPERIENCE. WE FIND THAT ASSEMBLY EXPERIENCE IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH A MEASURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE POLITY IV INDEX THAT EMPHASIZES CONSTRAINT. OUR ESTIMATES IMPLY AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE FOR COUNTRIES WITH ASSEMBLY EXPERIENCE - AN INCREASE IN EXPERIENCE FROM ZERO TO THAT OF AN AVERAGE STASAVAGE COUNTRY WOULD IMPROVE THE COUNTRY'S PROPERTY RIGHTS SCORE BY NEARLY 1.5 POINTS.
484	DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE COMMON AND CIVIL LAW ARE CRUCIAL WHEN CONSIDERING THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN A POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE 1993 CONSTITUTION OF THE KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA PROVIDES FOR A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WITH SEPARATION OF POWERS, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. HOWEVER, CAMBODIA RANKS POORLY IN INTERNATIONAL INDICES OF POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AND CORRUPTION IN THE JUDICIARY AND FOR THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON INTERVIEWS WITH CAMBODIAN STATE OFFICIALS AND LEGAL PRACTITIONERS, THE ARTICLE SITUATES THE DOMESTIC JUDICIARY WITHIN THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH IT MUST OPERATE AND EXAMINES THE LIMITS TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE LACK OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN CONTEMPORARY CAMBODIA IS NOT ONLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ITS NEOPATRIMONIAL POLITICAL CULTURE BUT ALSO TO THE LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED DURING THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL AUTHORITY IN CAMBODIA (UNTAC) PERIOD. THE LEGAL-PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF CIVIL LAW, THE NATURE OF THE CIVIL LAW SYSTEM OPERATING IN CAMBODIA, AND HOW IT IS INTERPRETED LOCALLY, ARE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE LIMITS TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE COUNTRY.
485	PROHIBITION OF PERCEIVED AND ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST HAS BEEN A CONSTITUTING PART OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW. NOT MUCH INTEREST HAS BEEN SHOWN IN ACADEMIA TO RESEARCH THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR LACK OF INTERNALISATION OF PROHIBI-TION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN STATE INSTITUTIONS AND CONSE-QUENCES THEREOF FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE). ONLY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED SO FAR EXAMINING THE IMPORTANCE OF PROHIBITIONS OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER FILLS THE GAP BY AD-DRESSING PRECISELY THIS ISSUE. IT AIMS TO ANALYSE THE NORMA-TIVE FRAMEWORKS OF THE PROHIBITION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN CEE BY FOCUSING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF SLOVENIA, WHICH CAN BE EXTRAPOLATED IN THE REGION. EQUIPPED WITH THIS KNOWL-EDGE, IT QUESTIONS WHETHER THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORKS AND PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO ERADICATE THE RISKS OF PO-TENTIAL AND ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN STATE INSTITUTIONS.
486	PERU IS FACING A CRISIS OF CITIZEN INSECURITY THAT STEMS IN PART FROM THE RULE OF LAW DEFICITS CONNECTED TO JUDICIAL PROBLEMS AND CORRUPTION THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS SOUGHT TO REMEDY BUT FAILED TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS INSECURITY HAS FUELLED THE APPEAL OF KEIKO FUJIMORI, DAUGHTER AND POLITICAL HEIR OF THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME THAT RULED PERU IN THE 1990S, WHO OFFERS IRON-FIST POLICIES TO DEFEAT CRIME. TO UNDERSTAND HOW UNRESOLVED HUMAN SECURITY CONCERNS - SUCH AS CITIZEN SECURITY - ARE POTENTIALLY THREATENING TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE POLICIES, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE NEEDS TO BE CONCEPTUALISED AS ENCOMPASSING TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT TRANSITIONS. WHILE THE FIRST PHASE ADDRESSES THE INJUSTICES FROM THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF A CONFLICT OR FALL OF AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, THE SECOND TRANSITION MUST ADDRESS THE INSECURITIES THAT CAN POTENTIALLY THREATEN ANY PROGRESS THE STATE AND SOCIETY HAVE MADE TOWARDS ESTABLISHING DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW. IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE INSECURITIES RISKS THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE SECOND TRANSITION IN PERU, AND CAN POTENTIALLY CAUSE AUTHORITARIAN REVERSALS BY ENHANCING THE APPEAL OF POLITICIANS THAT PEDDLE LAW-AND-ORDER POLICIES TO ADDRESS THEM.
487	THE ROMANIAN SOCIETY, THE STATE, THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUDICIARY ARE FACING SEVERAL ESSENTIAL CHALLENGES OF THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD, AND THESE CHALLENGES HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE POSITION AND THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE CLARIFIED SINCE IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT THE JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SYSTEMS ARE NOT YET CAPABLE TO MANAGE THE CHANGES NECESSARY FOR THE INTEGRATION IN THE EUROPEAN JURIDICAL SPACE. WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE ROMANIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM, THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE AND THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAVE BECOME THE TWO MAIN ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR UNDERLYING THE INABILITY OF THE. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUDICIARY SYSTEMS TO ACT AND TO MEET THE CITIZEN'S NEEDS. THE ROMANIAN CITIZEN HAS BEEN FACING THE BURDEN OF CORRUPTION AND BUREAUCRACY, AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IS ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONS CALLED UPON NOT TO ERADICATE THIS PHENOMENON, BUT TO PREVENT IT AND TO KEEP IT UNDER CONTROL. WITHIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK, WHEN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL DEBATE RAISES ISSUES REGARDING A NEW REVIEW OF THE ROMANIAN CONSTITUTION, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED IS WHETHER THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IS A PUBLIC AUTHORITY BELONGING TO THE EXECUTIVE OR TO THE JUDICIARY. THE FOLLOWING PAPER STUDIES THE PLACE OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE WITHIN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL INDENTIFY AND DETERMINE ITS PLACE AND ROLE AT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY.
488	AT THE END OF 2014, CHINA INTRODUCED NEW SPECIALIST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) COURTS. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAD IP TRIBUNALS WITHIN THE PEOPLE'S COURTS, THE REFORM TO ESTABLISH SEPARATE IP COURTS WAS TOUTED AS A SIGNIFICANT STEP IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE GOVERNANCE OF IPRS IN CHINA. THIS IS NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THAT AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS CENTRAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS INSTITUTION AFFIRMS AND ENFORCES PRIVATE RIGHTS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING NECESSARY IMPARTIALITY IN THE PROCESS OF DECISION-MAKING AMONG PEER INSTITUTIONS. CHINA HAS RECENTLY UNDERGONE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE REFORMS WHICH AMEND SUBSTANTIVE IP LAW. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY BOTH ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REFORMS. INTRODUCING A SPECIALIZED COURT WITH EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION WILL LIKELY AFFECT OTHER INSTITUTIONS WITH SIMILAR COMPETENCES, E.G. GENERAL COURTS OR ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS. INSTITUTIONAL CHOICES SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF DECISION-MAKING BECAUSE THE PROCESSES OF DECISION-MAKING DIFFER AND WILL INVOLVE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. OFTEN, INSTITUTIONS MOVE TOGETHER AND A CHANGE IN ONE OF THEM IS LIKELY TO CAUSE A CHANGE IN ANOTHER, EVEN WITHOUT EXPLICIT EFFORTS TO EFFECT SUCH CHANGES. THEREFORE, ANY INSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROJECT NEEDS TO REFLECT MEASURES TO CONTAIN OR COORDINATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR IMPACTS ON OTHER INSTITUTIONS RESULTING FROM SUCH CHANGES. THIS PAPER PLACES CHINESE SPECIALIZED COURTS IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT. WE WILL FIRST DESCRIBE THE FUNCTION OF A SPECIALIZED IP COURT FROM A COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. NEXT, WE PLACE THE CHINESE SPECIALIZED IP COURTS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION-DRIVEN IP STRATEGY TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IN ITS ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHETHER THE PERSPECTIVE OF INSTITUTIONAL COMPARISON MAY BE APPLIED TO CHINESE INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT THE RATIONALE FOR INTRODUCING SPECIALIZED IP COURTS IN CHINA MAY BE MORE THAN MERELY IMPROVING TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETENCE AND CONCENTRATION OF EXPERTISE OF THE COURT; IT SIGNALS A STEP TOWARDS INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING, TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND MARKET-ORIENTED DECISION-MAKING.
489	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE 1988 CONSTITUTION OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE AFTER 30 YEARS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION. ASSERTS SOME OF ITS MORE ADVANCE SOCIAL, POLITICAL FEATURES AND EVALUATES THE CURRENT CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENT A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, BASED ON A RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EVOLVING CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. IT ALSO MAKES SOME COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL PROCESSES AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCES, WEIGHING WHETHER OR NOT BRAZIL STARTED A NEW ERA OF CONSTITUTIONAL THINKING IN LATIN AMERICA.
490	SINCE XI JINPING BECAME THE GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) IN 2012, ENORMOUS POLITICAL CHANGES HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN CHINA. WHILE MANY POLITICAL MEASURES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND LAUDED AS GREAT SUCCESSES BY THE MASS MEDIA, SCHOLARS ARE DIVIDED OVER THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF XI'S LEADERSHIP, WITH CRITICISM COMING FROM BOTH THE EXTREME RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. LIBERAL CRITICS SAY THAT XI'S LEADERSHIP TENDS TO BE MORE AUTHORITARIAN AND REPRESENTS SOME KIND OF RETURN TO THE MAOIST PERIOD, ON THE VERGE OF PERSONAL DICTATORSHIP. IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THESE NEGATIVE VIEWS, MANY SCHOLARS THINK THAT XI'S LEADERSHIP HAS GIVEN RISE TO A CLEANER, MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT THAT REPRESENTS THE REVIVAL OF THE COMMUNIST TRADITION, ESPECIALLY THE MASS LINE AND POPULAR DEMOCRACY. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHOR WILL TRY TO AVOID SUCH KIND OF IDEOLOGICALLY DICHOTOMOUS POSITIONS AND EXPLORE THE ROLE OF THE CPC IN THE GOVERNANCE OF CHINA ESPECIALLY UNDER XI'S LEADERSHIP. THE RESEARCH QUESTION OF THIS PAPER IS, WHAT IS PATTERN OF THE GOVERNANCE IN CHINA, AND HOW XI'S LEADERSHIP CAN BE CHARACTERIZED FROM COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE. I WILL ARGUE THAT THE PARTY-CENTRED GOVERNANCE BASED ON RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN EMERGING UNDER XI'S LEADERSHIP. THIS PAPER CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS. FIRST, THE PARTY-CENTRED APPROACH WILL BE INTRODUCED AFTER REVIEWING THE PREVIOUS APPROACHES IN CONTEMPORARY CHINESE POLITICAL STUDIES. SECOND, THE DIFFERENT AND DISTINCTIVE PERIODS OF CPC LEADERSHIP WILL BE ANALYZED IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE STATE, THE RULE OF MAN AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE THIRD SECTION, MAJOR POLITICAL MEASURES TAKEN BY XI JINPING LEADERSHIP WILL BE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, ESPECIALLY THE STATE-BUILDING BASED ON RULE OF LAW AND PARTY-BUILDING BASED ON THE STRICT DISCIPLINE. FINALLY, THE IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE IN CHINA WILL BE EXPLORED AND EXPLAINED FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE.
491	COLOMBIA HAS, SINCE 1821, WITH A CLEAR IDEOLOGICAL BASIS THAT THE RULE OF LAW ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF 1991. FREEDOM, EQUALITY, JUSTICE, PUBLIC MORALITY AND EDUCATION ARE THE PILLARS THAT SUPPORT OUR INSTITUTIONS FOR ALMOST TWO CENTURIES. THESE IDEALS HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY DEVELOPED AND THEREFORE ARE STILL VALID WHEN ONE SPEAKS OF A SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC STATE WITH SEPARATION OF POWERS AND A PROPER LAND REFORM.
492	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE LINKS BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND THE LAW OF FREE TRADE. DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND FREE TRADE MORE SO THAN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE MORE INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHETHER THE CONVERSE IS TRUE, THAT IS, DO ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND FREE TRADE AID DEMOCRACY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW? THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THAT QUESTION.
493	THIS PAPER EXAMINES HANS KELSEN'SCOMMUNIST THEORY OF LAWIN THE CONTEXT OF HIS GENERAL CRITIQUE OF NATURAL LAW THEORIES. KELSEN ARGUES THAT SINCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED NATURAL LAW, A THEORY THAT ATTEMPTS TO USE IT TO ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS ON POSITIVE LAW IS AT RISK OF AUTOMATICALLY JUSTIFYING THE LATTER. KELSEN DEPLOYS THIS 'PANDORA'S BOX OBJECTION' IN HIS CHARACTERISATION OF THE COMMUNIST THEORY OF LAW AS THE 'HANDMAIDEN' OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT THAT CONSERVED, RATHER THAN CHALLENGED, OPPRESSIVE POLICIES. THE OBJECTION IS LIMITED IN SCOPE. FIRSTLY, IT APPLIES ONLY TO 'FORWARD-LOOKING' COMMUNIST THEORIES OF LAW THAT JUSTIFY TRANSITIONAL SOCIALIST LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS RATHER THAN SEEK TO ABOLISH THE LEGAL FORM AS A WHOLE. SECONDLY, IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE INDEPENDENT FROM NATURAL LAW FETTERS - HENCE THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE A 'BLANK CHEQUE' TO INTRODUCE ANY POSITIVE LAW.
494	BY TAKING THE PILOT POLICY OF ACCOUNTABILITY AUDIT OF NATURAL RESOURCE (AANR) AS A QUASI-NATURAL EXPERIMENT, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACTS OF AANR ON CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CEP). THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF MEDIA SUPERVISION AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE ALSO EXAMINED FROM AN EXTERNAL SUPERVISION PERSPECTIVE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AANR SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTES CEP. MEDIA SUPERVISION SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENS THE PROMOTION EFFECTS OF AANR ON CEP, AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCES THE PROMOTION EFFECTS OF AANR ON CEP. ON FURTHER ANALYSIS, THE IMPACTS OF AANR ON CEP ARE FOUND SIGNIFICANT IN COASTAL REGIONS AND IN HEAVILY POLLUTING ENTERPRISES.
495	GIVEN THAT TALK ABOUT "STAKEHOLDERS" HAVE BECOME COMMONPLACE IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM AN ACCOUNT OF THE THEORETICAL, JURISPRUDENTIAL, AND DOCTRINAL PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM COMPETING FRAMEWORKS. FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, THE AUTHORS CONCENTRATE ON THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION: WHETHER STAKEHOLDER APPLICATIONS CONSTITUTE ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES IN A PHILOSOPHY OF LAW APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT APPEARS THAT CURRENT MATCHES WITH CONCEPTS, NORMS AND STRATEGIES WARRANT, AS A MINIMUM, MORE CRITICAL REFLECTION. INCORPORATING STAKEHOLDER APPLICATIONS FROM VARIOUS UN-DOCUMENTS, THE AMBIGUITIES AND INADEQUACIES OF THESE - IN COMPARISON TO NON-UN ALTERNATIVES AND CONTEMPORARY LEGAL THEORY OF AN IDEALIST AND PROGRESSIVE ORIENTATION EVEN SEEM TO SUBSTANTIATE ARGUMENTS AGAINST TOO CLOSE AFFILIATIONS WITH THE TREND, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE SEPARATION THESIS RECENTLY RE-EMERGED IN BROAD FRAMEWORKS.
496	WE ARGUE THAT THE RECOGNITION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO THE CULTURAL IDENTITY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES HAS A LEGAL IMPACT AND POTENTIALLY EMANCIPATORY SCOPE THAT INTRODUCES A FRACTURE IN THE HEGEMONIC CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY FOR THE CRIMINAL DEFENSE OF INDIGENOUS PERSONS. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE AN EVOLUTIONARY NORMATIVE FOUNDATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND AN INTERCULTURAL CRITICAL THEORETICAL PROPOSAL THAT WE CONTRAST WITH JURISPRUDENTIAL EVIDENCE.
497	DUE TO THE MISMATCH OF MUNICIPALITY NAMES IN ARTICLE 5 OF THE LAW ON PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND THE OFFICIAL NAMES OF THE MUNICIPALITIES AS ADOPTED IN THE LAW ON TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE REPUBLIKA SRPSKA, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA CONSIDERED THE ABOVE MENTIONED ARTICLE AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THE COURT REQUIRED THE STATE-LEVEL PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY TO HARMONIZE THE LAW WITHIN SIX MONTHS, THE BOSNIAN AUTHORITIES DID NOT FIND A CONSTITUTIONAL SOLUTION ON TIME. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT THEREFORE ORDERED THE ANNULMENT OF THE LAW ON PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER IN FEBRUARY 2013 WHICH LED TO AN UNSATISFACTORY LEGAL SITUATION AS BABIES BORN SINCE FEBRUARY 2013 COULD NOT RECEIVE PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND THEREFORE NO BIRTH CERTIFICATES, HEALTH CARE CARDS OR PASSPORTS COULD BE ISSUED. AS A RESULT OF MASSIVE CIVIL PROTESTS IN NOVEMBER 2013 FINALLY A NEW LAW WAS ADOPTED.
498	THIS ESSAY USES TWO 1804 OPINIONS BY CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN MARSHALL TO EXPLICATE A WORLD IN WHICH UNDERSTANDINGS OF EXECUTIVE POWER AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT PREDOMINATE TODAY. SCHOLARS HAVE MISREAD LITTLE V. BARREME AND MURRAY V. SCHOONER CHARMING BETSY, THIS ESSAY ARGUES, BECAUSE THEY APPLY MODERN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE THAT DO NOT FIT THE MARSHALL COURT'S CONSTITUTIONAL VISION. CONTEMPORARY INTERPRETATIONS READ LITTLE FOR THE PROPOSITIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT'S INHERENT WARTIME POWER MAY BE LIMITED BY STATUTE AND THAT EARLY AMERICAN JURISTS REJECTED OFFICERS' "GOOD FAITH" DEFENSES TO LIABILITY FOR TORTIOUS ACTS. BUT THE OPINION IN FACT REFLECTS THE MARSHALL COURT'S VIEW THAT, IN AN UNDECLARED WAR, THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT ACT AT ALL UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS AND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES COULD THE PRESIDENT GIVE AN OFFICER A RIGHT TO ACT WHERE CONGRESS HAD NOT. CHARMING BETSY, MEANWHILE, IS KNOWN TODAY FOR THE "CHARMING BETSY CANON": MARSHALL'S ASSERTION THAT WHEREVER POSSIBLE, COURTS OUGHT TO INTERPRET THE LAWS OF CONGRESS TO ACCORD WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT, HOWEVER, THE CASE ILLUSTRATES MARSHALL'S VIEW OF THE LAW OF NATIONS NOT AS AN EXTERNAL CONSTRAINT ON SOVEREIGNTY-A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNATIONAL LAW'S ROLE TODAY-BUT AS AN ASPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW CRITICAL TO PRESERVING THE PROPER ALLOCATION OF POWERS BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT. INDEED, READ TOGETHER, THESE CASES SHOW MARSHALL USING THE LAW OF NATIONS TO REINFORCE A TENET CENTRAL TO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE NEW REPUBLIC: THAT ONLY CONGRESS COULD ALTER THE NATION'S WAR FOOTING. THROUGH LITTLE AND CHARMING BETSY, THE MARSHALL COURT SOUGHT TO FORECLOSE CONGRESS'S EFFORTS TO ABDICATE ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO AUTHORIZE ACTS OF WAR AND THUS TO UNDERSCORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE THAT PLACED THE WARMAKING AND LAWMAKING POWER NOT WITH THE COURTS, NOT WITH THE EXECUTIVE, BUT WITH CONGRESS.
499	THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE LEARNING OF FOREIGN LEGAL SYSTEMS. FOREIGN LEGAL HISTORY, AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTARY COURSES IN HIGHER LEGAL EDUCATION, IS BECOMING A DRIVING FORCE FOR CHINA'S PROGRESS TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW AND IS PLAYING AN INDISPENSIBLE ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM BY EDUCATING, CULTIVATING AND ACADEMIC EXCHANGING. THE DISCIPLINE OF FOREIGN LEGAL HISTORY NOT ONLY PROVIDES DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO TESTIFIES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IT NOT ONLY BENEFITS CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO MAKES CONTRIBUTION TO THE CULTIVATION OF THE NEW GENERATION OF CHINESE LEGAL TALENTS. THEREFORE, WE SHOULD INSIST ON LEARNING FROM THE LEGAL CULTURAL HERITAGE EMBEDDED IN FOREIGN LEGAL HISTORY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM.
500	EDITOR'S ABSTRACTTHIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SHANG YANG'S PHILOSOPHY OF LAW WAS NOT ONLY A MEANS TO ENRICH THE STATE AND STRENGTHEN ITS ARMY, BUT ALSO ENVISIONED THE ORDERLY RULE OF ALL ALL-UNDER-HEAVEN. THROUGH A FAIR, UNIVERSAL, AND RELIABLE USE OF REWARDS, PUNISHMENTS, AND ALSO TEACHING, THIS VISION OF LAWS COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE PROMOTION OF MORAL VALUES, POPULAR CONSENSUS, AND PEOPLE'S SELF-GOVERNANCE. WHILE THE AUTHORS ADMIT THAT IN SHANG YANG'S OWN HISTORICAL CONTEXT, LAW WAS NO MORE THAN A TOOL USED BY THE RULER TO SUPPRESS HIS PEOPLE, POTENTIALLY HIS IDEAS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A FUTURE CHINESE SOCIETY FULLY RULED BY LAW AND MORALITY, AND INSPIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW.
501	BRITISH AND AMERICAN VIEWS OF PUBLIC LAW HAVE DIVERGED GREATLY OVER THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF NEW YORK'S ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF FUNDAMENTAL LAW AND THE USE OF COLONIAL COMMON LAW COURTS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF NEW YORK SUBJECTS AGAINST THE PREROGATIVE POWER OF THE CROWN. AS A CONQUERED PROVINCE FROM 1664 TO 1683, NEW YORK WAS DENIED A LEGISLATURE. THEREAFTER THE COLONIAL LEGISLATIVE BODIES WERE ACTIVE IN MAKING UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO CLAIM THEIR BIRTHRIGHT AS ENGLISHMEN. IN ENGLAND THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION REPRESENTED A MAJOR STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPREMACY. IN NEW YORK, HOWEVER, IT FACILITATED AN ETHNIC INSURRECTION FOLLOWED BY THE REALIZATION THAT ENGLISH GOVERNMENTAL POLICY MANDATED THE DENIAL OF BASIC RIGHTS OF ENGLISHMEN TO COLONIAL RESIDENTS. THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION SIMPLY MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR PARLIAMENT, AS WELL AS THE CROWN, TO REGULATE COLONIAL AFFAIRS WITHOUT ANY CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS PRIOR TO 1774. IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DYNAMICS IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND, CONTINUED IMPERIAL RULE THROUGH AN UNTRAMMELLED ROYAL PREROGATIVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE POLITICAL POWER AND REVENUES OF THE CROWN. FAILING TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF MONARCHIAL POWER IN A GROWING EMPIRE, THE 1688-9 CONVENTION PARLIAMENT LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR AN UNBALANCED BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. DEPRIVED OF PATRONAGE AND EXTRAORDINARY REVENUES AT HOME, THE MONARCHS TURNED TO REGULATION OF THEIR EMPIRE AND TO REAPING INCREASED FINANCIAL BENEFIT. BOTH OF THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION THREATENED PARLIAMENTARY SUPREMACY, EVEN AS PARLIAMENT'S NEW-FOUND POWER BEGAN TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EMPIRE.
502	THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS FURTHER REFLECTIONS OF THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TO WHICH THE FOCUS ON GLOBAL LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IS DEDICATED. IT RETURNS TO SOME ISSUES RAISED IN THE COMMENTS BY OMAGGIO, KRYGIER, CASSESE AND WALKER, AND TREATS BRIEFLY THE QUESTION OF NON-ARBITRARINESS AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE SOCIOLOGICAL CONTENT OF THE LATTER, THE CONCEPT OF BALANCE IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PUBLIC LAW IN THE STATE, AND FINALLY THE NECESSITY OF RECOMPOSING THE LEGAL AND THE POLITICAL IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INTERCOURSES.
503	COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS (CNOS) REFERS TO GOVERNMENT INTRUSION AND/OR INTERFERENCE WITH NETWORKED INFORMATION COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURES FOR THE PURPOSES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY INTELLIGENCE. THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW CNOS ARE LAWFULLY AUTHORISED IN AUSTRALIA, AND CONSIDERS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE CURRENT USE OF CNOS ARE SUBJECT TO 'COUNTER-LAW' DEVELOPMENTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF CNOS IN AUSTRALIA ARE SUBJECT TO WEAK LEGISLATIVE CONTROLS, THAT WHILE SUCH OPERATIONS MIGHT BE 'LAWFUL', THEY UNDERMINE RULE OF LAW AND DISTURB CORE DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS.
504	THIS ARTICLE CONNECTS THE INSIGHTS OF POST-REALIST SCHOLARSHIP ABOUT RADICAL INDETERMINACY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LEGITIMACY OF ADJUDICATION TO THE CURRENT LEGITIMACY CRISIS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT REGIME. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE EXPOSED SERIOUS SHORTCOMINGS IN INVESTMENT LAW AND ARBITRATION INCLUDING PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS AND THE SUBSTANTIVE ASYMMETRY OF THE RIGHTS PROTECTED. THESE CRITICISMS HAVE PROMPTED A BROAD CONSENSUS IN FAVOR OF AMENDING THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT REGIME AND MULTIPLE REFORM PROPOSALS HAVE APPEARED THAT APPEAL TO THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR INCREASING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT SYSTEM. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE RELIANCE OF SUCH PROPOSALS ON JURISPRUDENTIAL APPROACHES THAT FAIL TO ADEQUATELY ACCOMMODATE THE POST-REALIST INDETERMINACY CRITIQUE AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THE ROLE OF IDEOLOGY IN ADJUDICATION RENDERS REFORM EFFORTS UNABLE TO SOLVE THE LEGITIMACY PROBLEMS OF THE INVESTMENT REGIME. THE CONCLUSIONS SUGGEST THE NEED TO ABANDON IMPLAUSIBLE CLAIMS TO DEPOLITICIZATION AND FACE THE METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES POSED BY THE PROMISE OF IDEOLOGICALLY BALANCED ASSESSMENTS ADVANCED BY SOME RULE OF LAW THEORISTS. THE ARTICLE FINALLY POINTS AT THE URGENCY TO REFORM TRADITIONAL APPROACHES TO DOCTRINAL WORK IN ORDER TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF CRITICAL CHALLENGES AND OPEN UP DOCTRINAL METHODS TO ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGICAL AVENUES.
505	THIS STUDY DEVELOPS A CAUSAL MODEL OF THE INDEPENDENT EFFECT OF ORGANIZED CRIME, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION ON NATIONAL WEALTH. TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZED CRIME A COMPOSITE ORGANIZED CRIME INDEX (COCI) IS CONSTRUCTED COMBINING DATA ON THE PERCEIVED PREVALENCE OF ORGANIZED CRIME, UNSOLVED HOMICIDES, GRAND CORRUPTION, MONEY-LAUNDERING AND THE EXTENT OF THE BLACK ECONOMY, DRAWING ON THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM'S ANNUAL SURVEYS AMONG CEOS OF LARGER COMPANIES, THE MERCHANT INTERNATIONAL GROUP'S ASSESSMENTS OF INVESTMENT RISKS IN 150 COUNTRIES, STUDIES BY THE WORLD BANK INSTITUTE, AND OFFICIAL CRIME STATISTICS. THE FINDINGS OF THE EXPLORATIVE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT A POLITICAL STRATEGY OF TOLERATING ACTIVITIES OF LOCAL CRIMINAL GROUPS IN THE HOPE OF BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON THE WEALTH OF A NATION IS UNLIKELY TO BRING THE EXPECTED RESULTS. ALTHOUGH SOME TYPES OF ORGANIZED CRIME MAY BRING IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUES, TOLERATING MAFIA-TYPE ACTIVITIES IMPLIES LETTING THE TROJAN HORSE OF RACKETEERING AND GRAND CORRUPTION INTO THE WALLS OF GOVERNMENT.
506	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES POLICE INDEPENDENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MILITARY POLICE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE MILITARY POLICE TO INVESTIGATE BOTH CRIMINAL CODE AND CODE OF SERVICE DISCIPLINE OFFENCES SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND AS A PRINCIPLE OF FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE UNDER SECTION 7 OF THE CHARTER. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE INCREASED RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICE INVESTIGATIVE INDEPENDENCE SINCE THE SOMALIA INQUIRY, INCLUDING THE RECENT EXPANSION OF THE COMMAND AUTHORITY OF THE CANADIAN FORCES PROVOST MARSHAL OVER ALL MILITARY POLICE. THE RELATION BETWEEN POLICE INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IS DISCUSSED. THE AUTHOR NOTES THAT WHILE THE MILITARY COMMAND STRUCTURE HAS A LEGITIMATE INTEREST IN PROVIDING GENERAL AND PUBLIC POLICY GUIDANCE TO THE MILITARY POLICE, CLAUSE 18.5131 OF BILL C-15-WHICH HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BUT NOT ENACTED IN PARLIAMENT-WOULD VIOLATE POLICE INDEPENDENCE BY ENABLING THE VICE CHAIR OF DEFENCE STAFF TO ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MILITARY POLICE IN SPECIFIC CASES. SUCH INTERFERENCE WITH THE INVESTIGATIVE INDEPENDENCE OF THE MILITARY POLICE WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH INCREASED POST-SOMALIA RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF POLICE INDEPENDENCE AND COULD UNDERMINE THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE CANADIAN MILITARY.
507	BUILDING A RULE-OF-LAW-BASED DEMOCRACY IS A CHALLENGE FOR POST-COMMUNIST AND POSTWAR SOCIETIES. RULE OF LAW IS A PRIORITY FOR THESE SOCIETIES AND ALSO ONE OF THE MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA REQUIRED BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, IN PARTICULAR THE EUROPEAN UNION. AS SUCH, AN ASPIRING COUNTRY LIKE KOSOVO HAS TO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING ITS LEGAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. THROUGH INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION, COUNTRIES STRENGTHEN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIMINAL ACTIONS THAT ARE PUNISHABLE IN ALL MODERN STATES AND ALSO EXCHANGE EXPERIENCE IN COMBATING CROSS-BORDER CRIME, TRAFFICKING, CORRUPTION, TERRORISM, AND OTHER VIOLATIONS OF CRIMINAL LAW. IN THIS REGARD, KOSOVO FACES MANY CHALLENGES IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION, NOT ONLY WITH REGARD TO THOSE MISSIONS OPERATING IN KOSOVO ITSELF (SUCH AS EULEX, UNMIK, ETC.), BUT ALSO WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY DUE TO KOSOVO'S LACK OF MEMBERSHIP IN THEM. ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT YET RECOGNIZED KOSOVO AS A STATE. THIS ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE EFFORTS MADE BY KOSOVO'S INSTITUTIONS TO ENGAGE IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION AS ONE OF THE PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AT HOME. THE MAIN ISSUES TACKLED IN THE ARTICLE ARE HOW THESE PROBLEMS ARE ADDRESSED IN PRACTICE, WHICH OBSTACLES ARISE, WHAT THE AD HOC MEANS ARE OF ENGAGING IN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION, AND WHAT THE SPECIFICITIES AND PROSPECTS ARE FOR KOSOVO'S INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION. AS SUCH, THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE LEGAL PECULIARITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED OVER THE YEARS AS THE RESULT OF LIMITATIONS ON KOSOVO'S INTERNATIONAL PERSONALITY AND TO CONSIDER INNOVATIVE MEANS TO ENSURE KOSOVO'S LEGAL COOPERATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.
508	FOR NEARLY A DECADE BULGARIA AND ROMANIA WERE CONSIDERED THE LAGGARDS OF THE FIFTH EU ENLARGEMENT. THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO COPE WITH THE TIMING OF THEIR EUROPEANISATION AND, HENCE, THE SUPPORT THEY GOT FROM THE EU WAS A MERE CONTINUATION OF THE PRE-ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY IN THE FORM OF POST-ACCESSION MONITORING, OBSCURELY NAMED "COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM" (CVM). THIS PAPER PRESENTS SOME SOUND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE CVM DID NOT WORK AS EXPECTED. THE MALFUNCTION OF THE MECHANISM WAS PRE-DESTINED BY A CRUCIAL MISTAKE IN ITS INITIAL POLITICAL DESIGN SINCE IT WAS MEANT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO SOOTHE THE WEST EUROPEAN DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE FIFTH ENLARGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EU'S CONSTITUTION PROJECT FAILURE. IT WAS NOT TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF A POST-COMMUNIST SOCIETY - TO ESTABLISH ANEW A RULE-OF-LAW (ROL) INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, WHICH WAS THE CORE SOCIETAL PROBLEM. THE REAL ISSUE AT STAKE WAS NOT THE "UNPREPAREDNESS" OF THE TWO NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, BUT A MAJOR FLAW IN THE APPROACH OF THE EU ENLARGEMENT POLICY, WHICH HAS MANIFESTED LATELY, IN A MUCH HARSHER FORM OF SERIOUS RULE OF LAW ABUSES, BY THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PREVIOUS "BEST PERFORMERS OF THE FIFTH ENLARGEMENT" - HUNGARY AND POLAND.
509	E.P. THOMPSON MAINTAINED A STEADY AMBIVALENCE TOWARD "THE RULE OF LAW" IN THE CONTEXT OF EARLY MODERN ENGLAND, FAMOUSLY CALLING IT, IN WHIGS AND HUNTERS, BOTH "HUMBUG" AND AN "AN UNQUALIFIED HUMAN GOOD." WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE, THOMPSON CLAIMED, COULD GAIN OR LOSE GROUND THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AS ANYWHERE ELSE; THEY COULD MAKE USE OF THE STATE, AND EMBED THEIR VICTORIES INTO ITS JURIDICAL STRUCTURE, AS WELL AS BE CRUSHED BY IT. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT THOMPSON'S PERSPECTIVE SERVES US WELL IN UNDERSTANDING LEGAL STRUGGLES AND OUTCOMES OVER THE TERMS OF COERCED LABOR, LONGSTANDING UNDER LIBERAL AMERICAN CAPITALISM, YET, INCREASINGLY BROUGHT INTO THE MARKET, PRIVATIZED, OR EXPANDED IN THE NEOLIBERAL UNITED STATES. I DESCRIBE THIS PROCESS AS THE DIALECTIC BETWEEN REPRESSION, COMPETING SYSTEMS OF RIGHTS, AND CHANGE ACROSS A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES: THE EMERGENCE OF "WORKFARE" IN THE 1960S AND 1970S, CULMINATING IN THE 1996 FEDERAL LAW SIGNED BY PRESIDENT CLINTON; THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE MODERN PRISON, AND, FORCED LABOR WITHIN IT; STATE CONTROL OVER DEPORTABLE LABOR; AND THE LEGAL REGIME UNDERLYING GLOBALIZED PRODUCTION-E.G., THE DENIAL OF LEGAL STANDING TO WORKERS ABROAD TO SUE AMERICAN INTERESTS. IN EACH CASE, I NOTE HOW THERE HAS BEEN PRESSURE EXERTED "FROM THE BOTTOM UP," AS WORKERS HAVE ENGAGED DISCOURSES OF FORMAL EQUALITY AND NORMS OF LIBERALISM TO MAKE CLAIMS ON A LEGAL REGIME THAT VIOLATES SUCH PRINCIPLES EVEN AS IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY PART OF MARKET PROCESSES. NEOLIBERALISM COMES INTO VIEW AS AN AMALGAM OF LEGAL COERCION AND A STRUGGLE OVER RIGHTS-THE JANUS FACE OF THE LAW DESCRIBED BY THOMPSON-UNDER CONDITIONS OF MARKET-BASED CHANGE.
510	A GENERAL PRACTICE OF PRECEDENT IS ONE THAT CAN PLAUSIBLY APPLY TO ANY WELL-FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS PRACTICE, WHICH CAN BE GROUNDED IN THE RULE OF LAW, NEEDS TO MAKE IT THE CASE THAT COURTS ALWAYS HAVE A LEGAL REASON FOR FOLLOWING RELEVANT PRECEDENT - EVEN IF THE PRECEDENT IS MORALLY SUBOPTIMAL, SO LONG AS IT IS NOT EVIL. WITHOUT THIS REASON, A PRECEDENT MAY BE TREATED AS HAVING NO LEGAL INFLUENCE FOR THE LATER COURT ('THE NULL MODEL'), AND THIS RUNS COUNTER TO THE RULE OF LAW. ON TOP OF THIS REASON, COURTS MAY HAVE A GENERAL LEGAL OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW PRECEDENT - STARE DECISIS - BUT THIS RISKS ENTRENCHING MORALLY BAD DECISIONS IN THE LAW. WE NEED, THEREFORE, A TYPE OF REASON THAT LIES IN BETWEEN THE NULL MODEL AND STARE DECISIS AS A NECESSARY STEP FOR ANY FUTURE JUSTIFICATION OF STARE DECISIS. BUT HOW CAN COURTS HAVE A LEGAL REASON FOR FOLLOWING MORALLY SUBOPTIMAL PRECEDENT? THEY CAN HAVE THAT REASON, I ARGUE, IN VIRTUE OF A SPECIFIC JUDICIAL DUTY, POSITIVELY LAID DOWN IN A LEGAL SOURCE, WHICH AIMS TO ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW IN AN INSTITUTIONALISED WAY. IN THIS ARTICLE, I AIM TO EXPLAIN AND JUSTIFY THAT JUDICIAL DUTY.
511	SEVERAL EUROPEAN UNION (EU) GOVERNMENTS HAVE INFRINGED THE OBLIGATION TO RESPECT 'RULE OF LAW' AS DEMANDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATY BUT, DESPITE ITS SUPRANATIONAL FEATURES, THE EU HAS DONE LITTLE TO SANCTION THOSE VIOLATIONS. WHY? THE EUROPEAN UNION'S INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES PARADOXICALLY PERMIT (AND EVEN ENCOURAGE) LOGICS THAT MIGHT BE INHIBITING ITS SANCTIONING CAPACITY. THUS, A PARTISANSHIP LOGIC INFORMS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THIS PROTECTS ERRANT STATES. THEN, THE COMMISSION, RATHER THAN ACTING ASSERTIVELY, ANTICIPATES THE COUNCIL'S STANCE AND ADAPTS ALSO ITS ACTIONS TO ANTICIPATE A 'COMPLIANCE DILEMMA' (I.E. COMPLIANCE DEPENDS ULTIMATELY ON THE GOOD WILL AND COOPERATION OF DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES). THE COMMISSION PREFERS TO CHANNEL ITS SANCTIONING ACTIVITY VIA OTHER SOFTER INSTRUMENTS (E.G. INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURES). FINALLY, A DISTASTE FOR INCREASING EU COMPETENCE, IDEOLOGICAL SYMPATHY FOR ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS, OR FEARS OF SPILLOVERS FROM SANCTIONING ACTIVITY INFORM THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE COUNCIL. THOSE THREE INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS COMBINE TO EXPLAIN THE UNEXPECTEDLY LOW SANCTIONING RECORD FOR BREACHES OF EU VALUES.
512	THE U.S. FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT IS LIMITED BY A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PRIVATE PERSON COULD BE LIABLE UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE THE DISCRETIONARY FUNCTION EXCEPTION, WHICH BARS A CLAIM BASED "UPON THE EXERCISE OR PERFORMANCE OR THE FAILURE TO EXERCISE OR PERFORM A DISCRETIONARY FUNCTION OR DUTY ON THE PART OF A FEDERAL AGENCY OR AN EMPLOYEE OF THE GOVERNMENT, WHETHER OR NOT THE DISCRETION INVOLVED BE ABUSED." HOWEVER, A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNCTION EXCEPTION CAN BE HARMFUL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW BECAUSE IT RESTRICTS GOVERNMENT AGENTS'S RESPONSIBILITY. SCHOLARS ARGUE THAT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE REQUIRES A LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENTAL LIABLITY BECAUSE COURTS MUST ACCEPT THE DECISION THAT AGENCIES MAKE WHEN IMPLEMENTING THE LAW. BUT SEPARATION OF POWERS DOES NOT PROTECT UNLAWFUL ADMINISTRATIVE CONDUCT. RATHER, THE POSSIBILITY OF TORT LIABILITY CAN GIVE A NEGATIVE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AVOID VIOLATION OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. SINCE THE DETERRENCE CONCEPTION OF TORT LAW CAN HELP TO MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AGUE IN FAVOUR A BROADER GOVERNMENT LIABILITY AND A NARROW INTERPRETATION OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNCTION EXCEPTION.
513	FUKUYAMA'S CONCEPTION OF POLITICAL ORDER CENTERS ON THE STATE, THE RULE OF LAW, AND POPULAR ACCOUNTABILITY, BUT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY ACCOUNT FOR HOW INTERNATIONAL FACTORS AFFECT THESE ELEMENTS OF CONTEMPORARY GOVERNANCE. FOCUSING ON THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC), THE ARTICLE NOTES HOW INTERNATIONAL SOURCES OF POLITICAL ORDER SHAPED EACH ELEMENT OF FUKUYAMA'S FRAMEWORK: CONFLICT AND WAR STRENGTHENED THE PRC'S STATE APPARATUS, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HELPED PROVIDE THE RULE OF LAW THAT UNDERGIRDED CHINA'S ECONOMY GROWTH, AND INTERNATIONAL NORMS INFLUENCED HOW THE CHINESE STATE SOUGHT AND RECEIVED POPULAR LEGITIMACY. EACH OF THESE FACTORS WILL CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE THE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRC GOING FORWARD.
514	THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW IN BRAZIL ARE CONSTANTLY DENIED. DESPITE CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY, TOOLS OF MUTUAL CONTROL AND THE SAFEGUARDS OF RIGHTS ARE DEFECTIVE. A NEW THREAT FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM ARISES: A JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT ENCROACHES UPON THE LAW AS IF IT WERE MERELY ADVANCING MORAL VALUES. POPULISM - AN OLD ENEMY OF DEMOCRACY - PRESENTS ITSELF AS A NEW FRIEND OF JUDGES, WHO OFTEN DISREGARD EXPLICIT RULES SO THEY CAN "DECIDE FAIRLY". THIS ARGUMENT IS CERTIFIED BY RECENT JUDICIAL RULINGS THAT OFTEN TAKE HOLD OF A "LANGUAGE OF EXCEPTION" THAT AUTHORIZES JUDGES TO GO BEYOND LAW'S BOUNDARIES IN THE NAME OF THE PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST OR EVEN IN ORDER TO RESTRICT DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS' RIGHTS AND PREROGATIVES. THE SAME PHENOMENON CAN BE WITNESSED WHEN IT COMES TO JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHEN A SINGLE JUDGE IS AUTHORIZED TO TEMPORARILY WITHDRAW A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OR EVEN WHEN ONE STARTS TO CHERISH A FABRICATED AND SUPPOSEDLY DEMOCRATIC LAW THAT DIRECTLY VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION - AS A RESULT, THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLES IN BRAZIL BECOME IRRELEVANT. THE RULE OF LAW OPENS UP NO SPACE FOR HEROES, EVEN THOSE IN ROBES. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS LACKING RESTRAINT WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLY WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES.
515	SCHOLARS CATEGORIZE SOCIETIES INTO RULE OF MAN SOCIETIES, RULE BY LAW SOCIETIES, AND RULE OF LAW SOCIETIES ON THE BASIS OF A STATUS OF LAW. AFTER 1978, CHINA'S LEADERS INVOKED LAW AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED QUANTITATIVE METHODS TO EXPLORE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' VIEWS ON THE STATUS OF LAW IN POST-REFORM CHINA. SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN THREE NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES LOCATED IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF CHINA. RESPONSES FROM UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOW THAT THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF WELL-DEVELOPED LEGISLATION AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE PUBLICITY OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, WHICH COULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF A RULE OF LAW SYSTEM. HOWEVER, THE STUDY FOUND THAT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE OF THE VIEW THAT THE POLITICAL NATURE OF LEGISLATION AND INTERFERENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT MODERATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGISLATION AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. THE POLITICAL NATURE OF LEGISLATION ALSO MODERATES THE MEDIATION EFFECT OF INTERFERENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BETWEEN LAW PUBLICITY AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. AS SUCH, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT ALTHOUGH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE NO LONGER PRIMARY MOVERS IN CHINA'S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AFTER THE TIANANMEN INCIDENT, THEY ARE STILL KNOWLEDGEABLE IF NOT CRITICAL ABOUT THE STATUS OF LAW AND ITS POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS.
516	THE NEW CHINESE LEADERSHIP PROMISED TO DELIVER A 'CHINESE DREAM' WITH THE REJUVENATION AND THE PROSPERITY OF THE CHINESE NATION AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE AS CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT GOALS. WHILE ARTICULATING THE NECESSITY OF THE FURTHER REFORM AND OPENING-UP, THEY ALSO PUT AN EMPHASIS ON THE ADHERENCE TO A 'SOCIALIST WAY OF CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS' IN THAT THE PARTY LEADERSHIP IS REGARDED AS ITS IMPERATIVE. FOR THE 'CHINESE DREAM' TO BE REALIZED, A SET OF VALUES WERE PROCLAIMED, INCLUDING PROSPERITY, DEMOCRACY, CIVILITY, HARMONY, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, JUSTICE, RULE OF LAW, PATRIOTISM, DEDICATION, INTEGRITY AND FRIENDSHIP. BESIDE THE EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE SYSTEM OF DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM, THE CCP-LED MULTI-PARTY COOPERATION AND SYSTEM OF PEOPLE'S CONGRESSES, A SET OF NEW INSTITUTIONS WERE PROCLAIMED AS WELL, INCLUDING A BRAND NEW 'SOCIALIST' SYSTEM OF RULE OF LAW AND MODERN STATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. THIS PAPER PROVIDES UPDATED INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS OF THESE NEWLY PROCLAIMED VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS, WHICH SERVE AN IMPORTANT NEW FOUNDATION FOR CHINA TO GAIN HIGH ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY, SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTIVITY, AND ESCAPE FROM A 'MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP', AND SUPPORT THE ENDEAVOR TO REALIZE THE 'CHINESE DREAM'. HOWEVER, ITS REALIZATION DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE NEW LEADERSHIP CAN SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCE A COMPETITIVE MARKET ORDER AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE YEARS TO COME.
517	THIS PAPER COMPARES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS ON MEN AND WOMEN'S DECISIONS TO ESTABLISH NEW BUSINESS START-UPS BETWEEN 2001 AND 2006. WE USE DATA FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR SURVEY (GEM) WHICH COVER AT LEAST 2,000 INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR IN EACH OF UP TO 55 COUNTRIES AND HAVE MERGED IT WITH COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA, FROM THE WORLD BANK, ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT, POLITY IV AND THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. WE FIND THAT WOMEN ARE LESS LIKELY TO UNDERTAKE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE STATE SECTOR IS LARGER, BUT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT GENERALLY FOUND TO HAVE GENDER-SPECIFIC EFFECTS. HOWEVER, MORE DETAILED INSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN, IN PARTICULAR, RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AWAY FROM HOME, MAKE IT LESS LIKELY FOR WOMEN TO HAVE HIGH ENTREPRENEURIAL ASPIRATIONS IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, EVEN IF THEIR ENTRY INTO ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SELF-EMPLOYMENT, IS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS.
518	I ARGUE THAT THE DEGREE TO WHICH A CRIMINAL SHOULD BE PUNISHED IS DETERMINED BY THREE ELEMENTS: A BASELINE AMOUNT THAT PROPORTIONALLY COMPENSATES THE VICTIM AND AN ADDITIONAL PENALTY THAT, FIRST, REFORMS THE CRIMINAL AND, SECOND, DETERS OTHERS FROM BECOMING UNJUST. MY INTERPRETATION PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO THE INTERPRETIVE PUZZLE THAT HAS MOST VEXED COMMENTATORS: THE ALLEGED TENSION BETWEEN PLATO'S PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY OF PUNISHMENT AND THE CONTENT OF HIS PENAL CODE. I DEFEND A TWO-STEP SOLUTION TO THE PUZZLE. FIRST, ON MY INTERPRETATION, BECAUSE OF THE BROAD ROLE THAT DETERRENCE MUST PLAY, THIS ALLEGED TENSION IS-TO A DEGREE-MERELY APPARENT. SECOND, THE ACTUAL TENSION CAN BE EXPLAINED BY PLATO'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW, GIVEN THE EPISTEMIC LIMITATIONS OF ACTUAL PEOPLE.
519	THE PRESENT STUDY WAS ENVISAGED TO QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATE THE LEVEL OF LEGALIZATION IN THE REGION BY CONSTRUCTING A MULTI-LEVEL INDICATOR EVALUATION SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, 4 FIRST-LEVEL INDICATORS AND 12 SECOND-LEVEL INDICATORS WITH SOUND LAWS AND REGULATIONS SYSTEM, AND PUBLIC-POWER EXERCISE RULES WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE STUDY. THE DEVELOPMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REGION WITH FULL CONSULTATION FROM THE RELEVANT EXPERTS, OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC WERE USED FOR THE STUDY. FURTHERMORE, A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BASED ON THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING REASONABLE FACTOR SET, DECISION SET, WEIGHT SET AND CONSISTENCY TEST. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE REGION'S RULE OF LAW LEVEL WAS AT THE "GENERAL" LEVEL AND NEEDED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT. IN THE PROCESS OF RULING BY LAW, THE REGION ALSO NEEDED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONTENT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND REQUIRED STRENGTHENING OF THE PROTECTION OF THE BASIC RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. THE FINDINGS OF OUR STUDY CAN ASSIST THE IMPROVEMENT OF REGION'S THE LEVEL OF LEGALIZATION AND ROUTINE WORK.
520	WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE CONSTITUTION IS VAGUE AND FULL OF SILENCES AND GAPS. RESPONDING TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OF 1876, THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT OF 1887 ("ECA') ATTEMPTED TO OFFER MORE SPECIFIC RULES. THE ECA WAS A MAJOR ADVANCE, BUT IN IMPORTANT WAYS, IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY COMPLICATED AND AMBIGUOUS, LEAVING IMPORTANT PUZZLES AND GAPS. THE ELECTORAL COUNT REFORM ACT OF 2022 ("ECRA'), AMENDING THE ECA IN RESPONSE TO THE HORRORS OF JANUARY 6, 2022, IS A PHENOMENAL ACHIEVEMENT; ON ESSENTIALLY ALL QUESTIONS, IT OFFERS A GREAT DEAL OF CLARITY. THE SIGNAL VIRTUE OF THE ECRA IS THAT IT VINDICATES THE RULE OF LAW BY SHARPLY CABINING THE DISCRETION OF BOTH CONGRESS AND THE STATES. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN U.S. HISTORY, THE ECRA REQUIRES THE RULE OF LAW IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, BY LIMITING THE RISK OF ON-THE-SPOT, EX POST MANEUVERING IN EITHER CONGRESS OR THE STATES.
521	CRIMINAL LAWS ARE CREATED TO ACHIEVE VARIOUS ENDS. THESE INCLUDE (1) REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF WRONGDOING, AND (2) HOLDING WRONGDOERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR WRONGS. SOME CRIMINAL LAWS ARE CREATED TO FURTHER THE FIRST OF THESE ENDS BY MEANS OF COMPLIANCE. THE SECOND END IS TO BE FURTHERED ONLY IF, REGRETTABLY, SOME FAIL TO COMPLY. THESE CRIMINAL LAWS ARE MADE TO BE FOLLOWED. OTHER CRIMINAL LAWS ARE NOT CREATED WITH COMPLIANCE IN MIND. CONVICTION, IN THESE CASES, IS NO REGRETTABLE FALLBACK. IT IS THE PRIMARY MEANS BY WHICH THE LAW IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO ENDS (1) AND (2). LAWS OF THIS SECOND KIND ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN. MY CONCERN IN THIS PAPER IS WITH THE CREATION OF SUCH LAWS. SECTION 1 SHARPENS THE CONTRAST DRAWN ABOVE, AND CONSIDERS SOME ARGUMENTS FOR ENACTING LAWS THAT ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS DEVELOP AN ARGUMENT AGAINST. SECTION 2 INTRODUCES WHAT I CALL THE IDENTIFICATION PRINCIPLE. IT ARGUES THAT THE PRINCIPLE IS AN IMPLICATION OF THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT IT BINDS STATE OFFICIALS WHO MAKE, APPLY AND ENFORCE CRIMINAL LAWS. SECTION 3 ARGUES THAT WHEN LAWS ARE MADE TO BE BROKEN, THE IDENTIFICATION PRINCIPLE IS VIOLATED. SECTION 4 CONCLUDES.
522	UTILIZING THE SET OF WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS PUBLISHED BY THE WORLD BANK, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT SCORING HIGHLY IN AN INDICATOR MEASURING RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER ATHLETES DISQUALIFIED AND HIGHER MEDAL SHARES AT THE SUMMER OLYMPICS FROM 1996-2016. NOTABLE REDUCTIONS IN DISQUALIFICATIONS AND INCREASES IN MEDAL SHARES OCCUR AT COINCIDENT PERCENTILE RANKS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED INDICATOR, WITH NATIONS AT THE 67(TH) PERCENTILE RANK AND ABOVE HAVING A 13.8% HIGHER PROBABILITY OF MEDALING AND A 12.11% LOWER PROBABILITY OF HAVING AN ATHLETE DISQUALIFIED. THESE RESULTS UNCOVER A NEW LINK BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND OLYMPIC SUCCESS AND PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE EXISTING ANTI-DOPING RULES AND ENFORCEMENT AS, CETERIS PARIBUS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT NATIONS WHOSE ATHLETES RESPECT AND ABIDE BY THE RULES ACHIEVE HIGHER MEDAL SHARES THAN THOSE WHOSE ATHLETES DO NOT.
523	THE ARTICLE WILL STUDY HORIZONTAL FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN BRAZILIAN SPORT, WITH THE ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC OBJECTS AND BROAD DISCUSSION, SUCH AS THE VOTE OF DEFAULTING MEMBER IN A SPORTS ASSOCIATION AND MANDATORY COLLECTION OF PROCEDURAL COSTS IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION BODIES OF THE BRAZILIAN FOOTBALL CONFEDERATION.
524	STATES THAT ENTER PERIODS OF PEACE OFTEN REVERT BACK INTO CONFLICT WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IN FACT, SOME STATES GO THROUGH ONGOING CYCLES OF PEACE AND CONFLICT. AGAINST THIS CONTEXT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE STATES REMAIN PEACEFUL AND STABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR POST-CONFLICT STATES THAT ARE FRAGILE. GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION (GNR), OR GUARANTEES OF NON-RECURRENCE, ARE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL CONCEPTS THAT HELP TO ENSURE STATES DO NOT REVERT BACK INTO CONFLICT. GNR CONSIST OF A VARIETY OF LAWS, PROCESSES, STATEMENTS AND DEEDS THAT ARE TAKEN UP (MOSTLY) BY A STATE TO RESOLVE PAST DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS THAT HAVE CAUSED DIFFICULTY. THESE GUARANTEES CAN BE TAKEN UP IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND ARE PUT INTO PLACE TO AVOID FUTURE PROBLEMS AND TO PROVIDE COMFORT TO THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE STATE WAS RUN DURING AND PRIOR TO A PAST CONFLICT. GNR, AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH OTHER AREAS, SUCH AS POST CONFLICT RECONCILIATION AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, ARE UNDER-STUDIED AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY UNDERSTOOD, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS WHAT THEY ARE, AND WHAT ROLE THEY CAN PLAY IN POST-CONFLICT STABILIZATION. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS LACUNA AND CONCEPTUALIZES GNR AS A PART OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ) EFFORTS. TO THAT END, THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES HOW TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, IN ADDITION TO VARIOUS DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS TOOLS, CAN AFFECT GNR OR NON-RECURRENCE OF CONFLICT. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT, WHILE GNR IS A PART OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ), IT IS ALSO A STAND-ALONE ITEM THAT OUGHT TO BE MUCH MORE RIGOROUSLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE ALSO EXAMINES HOW TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE OVERLAPS AND INTERCONNECTS WITH A RANGE OF OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS STATE (RE)BUILDING, STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, ENSURING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, ALLOWING FOR RECONCILIATION, NATION BUILDING, AND ENHANCING SOCIAL COHESION AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ENSURING THAT CONFLICT DOES NOT RE-EMERGE IN FRAGILE SOCIETIES. THESE OBJECTIVES, AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY CAN AFFECT GNR ARE EXAMINED IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION THEMSELVES, AND TO ENHANCE APPRECIATION FOR HOW THEY CAN BE APPLIED IN STATES SO THAT THEY DO NOT REVERT BACK TO CONFLICT. BY WAY OF CONCLUSION, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES SOME PRACTICAL STEPS THAT STATES CAN EMBARK ON TO ACHIEVE A UNIFIED AND SUSTAINED GNR STRATEGY.
525	THE ESSAY RECALLS THE ANALYSES OF THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, BEGINNING WITH THAT DEVELOPED BY CORNELIUS CASTORIADIS. IT THEN TURNS TO THE ONGOING ATTACK ON (INTER)NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND SOME OF THE MAIN RESPONSES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. FINALLY, IT EXAMINES THE REFLECTION ON LEGAL METHOD, CARRIED OUT BY FABIO CIARAMELLI IN L'ORDINE SIMBOLICO DELLA LEGGE E IL PROBLEMA DEL METODO, HIGHLIGHTING HOW IT CAN HELP ACHIEVE THE AMBITIOUS GOAL OF PRESERVING THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL LEGACY OF (INTER)NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM WHILE MAINTAINING AN OPENNESS TO THE FUTURE AND SOCIAL CHANGE.
526	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW THE WORKS OF SEVERAL ACADEMICS SPECIALIZED IN THE MATTER OF SECURITY, WHICH THE AUTHORS WILL USE AS AN ANALYTICAL SETTING AND REVISION THEIR OUTCOMES TO DEFINE AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF STATE CAPTURE. ONCE THE CONCEPT OF STATE CAPTURE IS DEFINED, THEN THE CASE OF MEXICO WILL BE ANALYSED. THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO DISCUSS SEVERAL INDICATORS REGARDING STATE CAPTURE SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, HOW POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAS ALSO INFLUENCED THE ISSUES OF CORRUPTION, IMPUNITY, AND MENTIONS HOW MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION SERVES AS A TOOL FOR TACKLING CORRUPTION. IN ORDER TO GRASP AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT STATE CAPTURE IS, WE MUST FIRST DEVELOP CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF CORRUPTION, IMPUNITY AND ITS CLASSIFICATIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE STATE APPARATUS. THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO ANALYSE THE IMPLICATIONS THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE MIGHT HAVE WITH REGARDS TO A STATE CAPTURED DEMOCRACY, FROM AN ACADEMIC APPROACH.
527	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF LEGAL STATEHOOD IN VARIOUS NATIONAL LEGAL SCHOOLS, INCLUDING GERMAN, BRITISH, AMERICAN, FRENCH, AND RUSSIAN LEGAL DOCTRINES. TENDENCIES OF CONVERGENCE OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE NOTED. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT, WITH ALL THE VARIETY OF APPROACHES, THE FOLLOWING FEATURES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RULE OF LAW IN MANY COUNTRIES: THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LAW; DIVISION OF POWER INTO LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE; RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE EXISTENCE OF A MECHANISM FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION; JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. ACCORDINGLY, THESE SIGNS INTERSECT WITH THE SIGNS OF DEMOCRACY AND PARLIAMENTARISM, WHICH ALLOWS US TO TALK ABOUT THE PROXIMITY OF THESE TERMS. PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IS CALLED A CONDITION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL STATE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PARLIAMENT IN A LEGAL STATE, INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF FAIR LAWS, RESPECT FOR THE CONSTITUTION, THE POSSIBILITY OF JUDICIAL AND OTHER EVALUATION OF THE OPERATION OF LAWS. IN PARTICULAR, WHEN ADOPTING A LAW, THE PARLIAMENT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT IT CONFORMS TO ELEMENTARY HUMAN IDEAS ABOUT JUSTICE, DIGNITY, FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY; THE PARLIAMENT, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE, CANNOT GO BEYOND THE CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED POWERS; THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PARLIAMENT TO "SEARCH FOR A COMMON WILL", TO ADOPT "FAIR" LAWS WILL BE SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL ASSESSMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS. SUCH REQUIREMENTS APPLY EVEN TO COUNTRIES WHERE THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SO-CALLED "RULE OF PARLIAMENT" IS IN EFFECT. IN TURN, THE THEORY OF PARLIAMENTARISM ALLOWS US TO PROPOSE SPECIFIC LEGAL LEVERS TO IMPROVE THE WORK OF REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS IN THE SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS INTERACTION WITH OTHER AUTHORITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE PROCESS OF SEARCHING FOR "FAIR" MANAGERIAL DECISIONS AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. THE AUTHOR NOTES THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL STATEHOOD. SHE ALSO PAYS ATTENTION TO ALTERNATIVE THEORIES IN RELATION TO LEGAL STATEHOOD, INCLUDING THE THEORY OF THE SOVIET LEGAL STATE, THE STATE OF TRUTH FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SLAVOPHILE TRENDS, AS WELL AS A NEW IDEA OF THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL THOUGHT OF MODERN RUSSIA, WHICH ENTERS INTO A CERTAIN DISSONANCE WITH THE DOCTRINE OF A LEGAL STATE - THE THEORY OF A "STRONG (EFFECTIVE)" STATE. HOWEVER, THE AUTHOR PROPOSES NOT TO EXAGGERATE THE NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RUSSIA AND TO CONSIDER THE RULE OF LAW AND PARLIAMENTARISM AS VALUES OF UNIVERSAL SIGNIFICANCE.
528	USING A PANEL OF DEMOCRACIES FROM 1987 TO 2016, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF A DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACY ON THE POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLE. TO SEPARATE DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES FROM EMBEDDED DEMOCRACIES, WE APPLY CLUSTER ANALYSIS TO THE CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY. WE FIND THAT THE POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLE IS SIGNIFICANT ONLY IN DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES. OUR FINDING INDICATES THAT THE ELECTORAL CYCLE CAN PERSIST EVEN THOUGH DEMOCRACIES BECOME OLD AND ECONOMIES BECOME ADVANCED. WE ALSO FIND THAT, OF THE CENTRAL ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY, WEAK RULE OF LAW AND AN INEFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT MAINLY EXPLAIN THE POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLE IN DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES.
529	LEGAL REFORMS MATTER FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. AS PART OF THE "SECOND-GENERATION REFORMS'', INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE SOUGHT TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW BY FUNDING A VAST ARRAY OF LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPING WORLD. YET ASIDE FROM SCATTERED ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE, THE GENERAL EFFECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE ON LEGAL REFORM AND THE RULE OF LAW REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS GAP BY DEVELOPING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT EXPLORES THE STRATEGIC INTERACTION AMONG INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS. USING ORIGINAL DATA ON WORLD BANK LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECTS, WE SHOW THAT WORLD BANK ASSISTANCE CAN IN FACT ENCOURAGE SOME TYPES OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS TO PROMOTE REFORMS THAT INCREASE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
530	FOR LAWYERS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS, LEGISLATION SEEMS A KNOWN QUANTITY-A RELATIVELY PERMANENT, PUBLIC EXPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACIES AND OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS 'KNOWABLE' CHARACTER CAN HOWEVER BE MISLEADING, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES WHY RESEARCH INTO ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION IS CHALLENGING BUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. A SHORT HISTORY OF UK ENVIRONMENTAL LAW PROVIDES SALIENT EXAMPLES OF POLITICAL STRESS AND HIGHLY COMPLEX, UNSETTLED, EVEN UNKNOWABLE, ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION. COLLECTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS DEMAND LEGISLATIVE RESPONSES IN SHAPING INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOURS AND GUIDING SOCIAL POLICIES-BUT KNOWING HOW TO CRAFT THESE RESPONSES AND HOW TO EVALUATE THE RESULTING LEGISLATION IS OFTEN UNCHARTED LEGAL TERRITORY. NAVIGATING THAT LEGISLATIVE TERRAIN IS A VITAL TASK FOR LEGAL SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS, PARTICULARLY TO INVESTIGATE THE SERIOUS LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT CAN ARISE FROM ITS CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING POOR LEGIBILITY, LEGAL FRAGMENTATION, AND CONCERNS ABOUT COMPATIBILITY WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
531	THE STUDY PURPOSE IS TO ESTIMATE THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND OTHER SOURCES OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW WITH THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT, LAW AND DEMOCRACY EFFECTIVENESS, TO COMPARE AND DETERMINE THE PRIORITIES OF RUSSIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. THROUGH A COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD, ISSUES RELATED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS INTERPRETATION AND LEGAL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AT SPECIFIC STAGES OF ITS DEVELOPMENT IN RUSSIA AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE EXAMINED. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY REVEAL THE ESSENCE OF THE GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF SOURCES OF RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND ARE OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE FOR SUBJECTS OF THE FORMATION OF STATE POLICY IN THE FIELD OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
532	THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED TODAY AND IT IS DULY STRESSED IN THE ECONOMIC LITERATURE. THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS AND AN EFFICIENT LEGAL SYSTEM ARE THE PILLARS OF THE CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, FORMAL INSTITUTIONS CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT BEING INTERNALIZED BY THE CITIZENS AND WITHOUT THE STRONG BACKING OF SOCIAL NORMS. MORALITY AND SOCIAL NORMS ARE THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE, THE SOCIAL CAPITAL, WHICH IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR SOCIAL WELFARE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS PAPER WE WILL DISCUSS BOTH THE FORMAL AND THE INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF ANCIENT ATHENS, WHICH WAS A FREE MARKET SOCIETY WITH ECONOMIC PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO CONTEMPORARY MARKET SOCIETIES. ATHENIANS DEVELOPED A HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS AND THE EFFICIENT RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES. SUCH AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FUNCTIONED EFFECTIVELY, CULTIVATING TRUST AND PROTECTING THE SECURITY OF TRANSACTIONS. THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM HOWEVER WAS BASED ON SOCIAL NORMS SUCH AS RECIPROCITY, THE VALUE OF REPUTATION AND WIDELY ACCEPTED BUSINESS ETHICS. CONFORMITY TO SOCIAL NORMS AS WELL AS MORAL BEHAVIOR WAS FOSTERED BY SOCIAL SANCTION MECHANISMS (SUCH AS STIGMA) AND MORAL EDUCATION. THE ATHENIAN EXAMPLE IS A FURTHER PROOF OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MORALITY AND SOCIAL NORMS AS TRANSACTION COST-SAVING DEVICES EVEN IN QUITE SOPHISTICATED LEGAL SYSTEMS. THEIR ABSENCE OR DECLINE LEADS INEVITABLY TO THE NEED FOR MORE REGULATION AND LITIGATION AND TO A GROWING PREFERENCE FOR CLEAR-CUT RULES INSTEAD OF DISCRETIONARY STANDARDS. ATHENIAN LAW WAS PIONEERING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULES AND INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS SUITABLE FOR THE REDUCTION OF TRANSACTION COSTS, MANY OF THEM SURVIVING IN THE MOST COMPLEX CONTEMPORARY LEGAL SYSTEMS.
533	THIS ARTICLE, GROUNDED IN PRAGMALINGUISTICS, AIMS TO IDENTIFY SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE WITH REGARD TO THE PROMINENT ACTORS INVOLVED OR PRESENTED IN THE NATIONAL DISCOURSE ON THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND, CONDUCTED IN GERMANY AND POLAND. ITS PURPOSE IS TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON TRANSNATIONAL DISCOURSE. THE METHOD PROPOSED, DEFINED AS AN EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY APPLIED DISCOURSE RESEARCH METHODS, IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF CRITICISING, CONSTRUED AS A COMPLEX LANGUAGE ACTION WHOSE COMMUNICATIVE GOAL CAN BE INFERRED MAINLY FROM THE CONTEXT, AS WELL AS ON THE BASIS OF THE RECIPIENTS' GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE INTERTEXTUAL AND DISCURSIVE REFERENCES. THE ANALYSIS WAS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE CONCLUSIONS ON THE INDIVIDUAL ACTORS AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE, THE KNOWLEDGE CONVEYED TO THE RECIPIENTS, AS WELL AS GENERAL SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE.
534	THIS PAPER SUBSUMES THE MYSTICISM OF CHINESE LAW BY DISTINGUISHING IT FROM OTHER BODIES OF LAW, WHILE ALSO RENDERING IT TRANSCENDENTAL IN THE CONTEMPORARY UNIVERSAL LEGAL CONTEXT. IT IS ALSO AN ATTEMPT TO ROMANTICIZE CHINESE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AS A FERTILE GROUND THAT CAN BE USED TO RE-THREAD THE FABRIC OF ERITREAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE ROOT OF THIS RESEARCH IS NOURNISHED BY AN EXTRAVAGANCE OF IDEAS AND DESIRES, WHICH IF APPLIED CAN MAKE THE UBIQUITY AND PLASTICITY OF THE RULE OF LAW FLOW ACROSS WHAT IS PERCEIVED TO BE "UNYIELDING" BORDERS. ERITREA HAS JUST TURNED TWENTY-FIVE AND DESPITE A TANGLED POST-INDEPENDENCE PERIOD, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ARTICULATING AND ADVANCING THE VISION OF THE PRE-INDEPENDENCE GENERATION. TODAY, ERITREA ENVISAGES REJUVENATING ITS GOVERNANCE WITH A NEW CONSTITUTION THAT NOT ONLY TALKS TO POST-INDEPENDENCE ERITREANS, BUT ALSO TRIGGERS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT WITH SUBSTANTIVE EMPHASIS ON THE RULE OF LAW. ERITREAN ENDEAVOURS CAN EASILY OPEN UP TO THE SEDUCTIVE APPEAL OF THE RICH CONCEPTUAL ENIGMA OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONAL POLITY, CHINA BEING ONE OF THE COUNTRIES WITH THE OLDEST LEGAL TRADITIONS IN THE WORLD. IT IS AXIOMATIC THAT CHINESE CONSTITUTION-CENTRED GOVERNANCE, WHICH IS WELL ADORNED WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, IS PRE-EMINENT, FOR IT HAS INFLUENCED CHINA SINCE 1949 TO APTLY RISE AS THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT ERITREAN CONSTITUTIONAL POLITY CAN BE EXAMINED THROUGH A CHINESE LENS, TO BE CALIBRATED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO EXHIBIT ERITREAN CHARACTERISTICS, AND STILL GOVERN BY THE RULE OF LAW.
535	USING DATA FOR PROXYING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WE CONFIRM HISTORICAL CONSENSUS THAT THE MEDIEVAL REPUBLIC OF RAGUSA (NOW DUBROVNIK) WAS A PROSPEROUS SMALL OPEN ECONOMY, RIVALING BIGGER COMPETITORS LIKE VENICE. MORE TENTATIVELY, WE TEST A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES ON THE DETERMINANTS OF SUCCESS, FINDING PARTIAL EVIDENCE THAT RAGUSA HAD STRONG FUNDAMENTALS WITH PRUDENT FINANCES, EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, GOOD GOVERNANCE, SOCIAL FAIRNESS, BUSINESS-FRIENDLY INSTITUTIONS, AND TRADE OPENNESS. RAGUSA MAY BE AN EARLY EXAMPLE OF A 'TIGER' ECONOMY WITH GROWTH-PROMOTING INSTITUTIONS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD TEST THE 'RESILIENCE HYPOTHESIS' THAT SUCH ECONOMIES ARE BEST ABLE TO DEAL WITH EXTERNAL SHOCKS.
536	THE 2008 GLOBAL FINANCIAL MELTDOWN WAS THE SYMPTOM OF AN UNDERLYING CRISIS IN LAW AND INSTITUTIONS CAUSED BY THE NEOLIBERAL UTOPIA OF TOTAL MARKET - "SCIENTIFIC" DEPOLITICIZATION OF THE ECONOMY, FULL COMMODIFICATION OF LABOUR, LAND AND MONEY, AND ALL-OUT COMPETITION, WITH EVEN LEGAL SYSTEMS SUBJECT TO "LAW SHOPPING". FINANCIAL MARKETS WERE SO SUCCESSFULLY DEREGULATED, THEY WERE THE FIRST TO COLLAPSE: TAXPAYERS ARE NOW PAYING THE BILLS. BUT THE MARKETS FOR NATURAL AND "HUMAN RESOURCES" ARE ALSO AT RISK. IN THE SPIRIT OF THE 1944 DECLARATION OF PHILADELPHIA, SUPIOT ARGUES, THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE REINSTATED TO END HUMAN SUBORDINATION TO ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY.
537	AS LEGAL PLURALISM HAS ENTERED THE LEXICON OF POLICY MAKERS AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS IN AFRICA, A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT IS ESSENTIAL. FOR THIS PURPOSE, DECODING LEGAL PLURALISM FROM A THEORETICAL, HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE IS HIGHLY RELEVANT AND REVEALS THAT LEGAL PLURALISM IS A UNIFYING DEVICE FOR LEGAL SYSTEMS IN AFRICA. ON THE ONE HAND, LEGAL PLURALISM IN ITS CLASSIC SENSE IS A DEVICE WHICH CONNECTS AND INCORPORATES PRE-COLONIAL LAWS INTO COLONIAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. IN A SIMILAR VEIN, IT RETAINS AND TRANSFORMS COLONIAL LAWS INTO POST-COLONIAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. LEGAL PLURALISM NEITHER BIFURCATES LEGAL SYSTEMS NOR PRESUPPOSES THE PARALLEL EXISTENCE OF CUSTOMARY LEGAL SYSTEMS WITH STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS. LEGAL PLURALISM BOTH IN ITS WEAK AND DEEP SENSE IS A MANIFESTATION OF THE UNITY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE PLURALITY OF LAWS IN AFRICA. ON THE OTHER HAND, LEGAL PLURALISM IN ITS NEW SENSE MAKES REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS PART OF STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS. THIS ACCOUNT OF LEGAL PLURALISM HELPS THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIALS OF CLASSIC LEGAL PLURALISM AND THE LEGAL SYSTEMS WITHIN WHICH IT IS OPERATING AND ENCOURAGES A FURTHER STUDY ON WHY DEEP LEGAL PLURALISM PERSISTS. MOREOVER, IT OPENS A SPACE FOR THE INCORPORATION OF NEW LEGAL PLURALISM WITH CLASSIC LEGAL PLURALISM IN THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.
538	THE ORIGIN OF THE ONGOING CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EU AND POLAND MAY, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, PARTLY BE SUBSCRIBED TO THE EU-INSTITUTIONS CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONCEPTUALIZATION, WHICH IN THE ARTICLE IS REFERRED TO AS "THE RULE OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM", ESTABLISHES A PARTICULAR SET OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONAL AND SUBSTANTIAL FRAMES AND LIMITS FOR NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. GRANTED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS AN INHERENTLY CONTESTED CONCEPT, THE AUTHOR DECONSTRUCTS THE RULE OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM, REVEALS ITS WEAKNESSES AND IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. "THE RULE OF PRAGMATISM" IS BASED ON A PRAGMATIC CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE LAW, AND PROSCRIBES A REGARD FOR SOCIAL CONTEXT AND CONSEQUENCES RATHER THAN ABSTRACT CONSTRUCTIONS AND (GOOD) INTENTION. IF APPLIED BY THE EU INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF PRAGMATISM WILL SECURE GREATER LEGAL AND POLITICAL PLURALISM IN EUROPE AND THUS CONTRIBUTES TO THE MENDING OF EU'S LEGITIMACY DEFICIT.
539	WHEN THE THREAT LEVEL OF FOREIGN STABILITY OPERATIONS INCREASES, MILITARY POLICE UNITS CAN MAKE AN EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONDUCTED WITH THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE. IT IS ARGUED THAT, IF AUSTRALIAN MILITARY POLICE CAN APPLY POLICE HARMONISATION TECHNIQUES AND IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT CIVILIAN-LIKE POLICING DUTIES, THEN THEIR ROLE IN FUTURE RULE-OF-LAW OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE.
540	FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS CONSTITUTE A KEY PART F THE LIBERAL SOCIETY MODEL AND THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL SCIENCE HAS ESTABLISHED THE MODE OF RECOGNITION AND THE NECESSARY GUARANTEES FOR ITS PROTECTION. IN THIS CONTEXT, A NEW DISCOURSE ON TOLERANCE HAS EMERGED. IN THIS ARTICLE, IT'S ANALIZED THE POSITION OF PROF. JAVIER DE LUCAS FOR WHICH WE MUST STOP TALKING ABOUT TOLERANCE AS A PUBLIC VIRTUE IN FAVOR OF THE REALIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOM.
541	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF CONSTRUCTING A PUBLIC SPACE TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE DATA ECOSYSTEMS FOR THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD. IT OUTLINES THREE MODELS OF DEMOCRACY -DELIBERATIVE, EPISTEMIC, AND LINKED-WHERE PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION CAN BE EXPLORED IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXISTING ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA, AND THE THEORY OF JUSTICE. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC SPACE, IT SUGGESTS EXPLORING THE ANALYTICAL DIMENSION OF LINKED DEMOCRACY, AND THE NEED FOR BUILDING NEW TOOLS TO REGULATE 'LINKED OPEN DATA', BASED ON RULE OF LAW AND THE ANALYTICAL DIMENSION OF THE META-RULE OF LAW. THE CONSTRUCTION OF 'INTERMEDIATE' OR 'ANCHORING' INSTITUTIONS WOULD HELP IN EMBEDDING THE PROTECTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW INTO SPECIFIC ECOSYSTEMS (INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT AND TACTIC MODELLING OF PRIVACY BY DESIGN).
542	AFTER THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS MORE RESTRICTIVE SECURITY LEGISLATION SEVERELY CURTAILED CIVIL LIBERTIES IN SEVERAL WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. DURING THE FOLLOWING DECADE, THERE WERE EFFORTS TO RESTORE THEM, ALBEIT TO A DIFFERENT EXTENT ACROSS COUNTRIES. USING DATA FROM THE DEMOCRACY BAROMETER, WE SEEK TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN THE RESTORATION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES IN 22 OECD COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012. WE FIND THAT A STRONG AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND A LIBERAL POLITICAL CULTURE ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE RESTORATION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES. BEING SUBJECT TO TERRORIST ATTACKS HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE RESTORATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DEMOCRATIC REGIMES ARE CAPABLE OF CORRECTING THEIR SECURITY LEGISLATION IF THEY ARE CONSTRAINED BY RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN A LIBERAL POLITICAL CULTURE.
543	THIS ARTICLE TAKES A LONG LOOK AT THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT MOVEMENT AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO ENTRENCH THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN ASIA VIA THE MEANS OF LEGAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (LTA) DESIGNED TO REFORM JUDICIARIES AND JUDICIAL BODIES. IT DOES SO WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO MYANMAR, BEING THE LATEST INSTANCE OF LTA IN ASIA. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN 30 ORGANISATIONS WORKING DIRECTLY ON RULE OF LAW LTA IN MYANMAR. SUCH EFFORTS OUGHT TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF THE ART AFTER HALF A CENTURY OF LTA. THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE TRAJECTORY OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE 1960S, NOTING THAT THE PHASES OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE LED US THROUGH INAUGURAL, CRITICAL, REVIVALIST "MOMENTS" TO A "POST-MOMENT" THAT APPEARS TO BE PLURALISTIC, AND CONTEXTUALLY NUANCED. IT NOTES THAT JUDICIAL REFORM HAS ALWAYS FEATURED IN LTA THROUGH ALL OF THESE "MOMENTS", AND DISCUSSES WHETHER OR IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES JUDICIAL REFORM IS THE MOST DESIRABLE OR JUSTIFIABLY PRIORITISED APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW LTA. IT CONCLUDES THAT IN THE CURRENT PHASE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT TOO MUCH EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON JUDICIAL REFORM, EXPLAINING WHY THIS IS SO AND WHY OTHER APPROACHES COULD BE MORE PROFITABLE. THE ARGUMENT LEADS TO A CONCLUSION THAT WE MIGHT NOW USEFULLY IDENTIFY A "BURMESE" MOMENT IN LAW AND DEVELOPMENT-ONE IN WHICH WE REALISE THAT ONE SIZE WILL NEVER FIT ALL CASES, THAT LAW AND DEVELOPMENT IS MULTI-FACETED AND NEEDS TO BE BROKEN DOWN INTO DISTINCT MODES OF OPERATION. IN THIS DISPENSATION, THE OPPORTUNITY IS OFFERED TO SECURE REAL AND ONGOING GAINS IN RULE OF LAW TECHNOLOGY.
544	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW OR CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT CAN EXPLAIN OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS AND TRADE CREDIT IN SMES FROM 13 EU COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS ARE LOWER AND WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS THUS MORE EFFICIENT IN COUNTRIES WITH SAFER LEGAL SYSTEMS AND BETTER INVESTOR PROTECTION. WE ALSO FIND THAT OPERATING IN A MARKET-BASED CAPITAL SYSTEM HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE (CCC). THIS IMPLIES THAT FIRMS OPERATING IN COUNTRIES WITH A MARKET-BASED SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO A BANK-BASED SYSTEM HAVE BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO MANAGE THEIR WORKING CAPITAL. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS EXPLAIN MUCH OF THE CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES OBSERVED IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT WORKING CAPITAL PRACTICES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRADE CREDIT IS USED ARE A PRODUCT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS IN PLACE IN EACH COUNTRY. IF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CHANGES, THE TRADE CREDIT PRACTICES CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED TO CHANGE.
545	THIS RESEARCH USES EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER SUBJECT POOL CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT HAVE AN EFFECT ON PARTICIPANTS' CORRUPT BEHAVIOR IN THE LABORATORY. WHILE WE FIND THAT SUBJECT POOL CULTURE DOES NOT AFFECT THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF CORRUPTION OF LABORATORY PARTICIPANTS, IT DOES AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF CORRUPTION AND ITS DISTRIBUTION. ADDITIONALLY, WE FIND THAT THE EFFECT ON CORRUPT BEHAVIOR DIFFERS WITH THE FRAMING OF THE EXPERIMENT'S INSTRUCTIONS. INTERESTINGLY, IN THE CONTEXT OF A WEAK RULE OF LAW AND HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION, LOADED NEGATIVE INSTRUCTIONS POSITIVELY AFFECT CORRUPT BEHAVIOR OF FIRMS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN THE CONTEXT OF A COUNTRY EXHIBITING A STRONG RULE OF LAW AND LOW LEVELS OF CORRUPTION FINDS NO FRAMING EFFECTS. WE ALSO FIND THAT INCREASING THE PROBABILITY OF DETECTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CORRUPTION AS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT OF THE BRIBES OFFERED/ACCEPTED AND THE PROBABILITY OF OFFERING/ACCEPTING A BRIBE. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT INDIVIDUAL RISK PREFERENCES NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOR.
546	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, AS FAR AS HUNGARY AND POLAND ARE CONCERNED, THE USE OF TERM "ILLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM" IS JUSTIFIED. IT ALSO CLAIMS THAT, WITHOUT DENYING THAT OTHER STATES COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, HUNGARY AND POLAND DISPLAY UNIQUE AND DISTINCTIVE FEATURES. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE POPULIST POLITICS, WHICH LEAD TO THE RELATIVIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY PRINCIPLES, AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, WHICH CAPTURED THE CONSTITUTION AND CONSTITUTIONALISM BY CONSTITUTIONALIZING POPULIST NATIONALISM, CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, AND CREATED NEW PATRIONALISM AND CLIENTELISM. ALL THESE FEATURES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE IDEOLOGICAL INDOCTRINATION OF POLITICAL CONSTITUTIONALISM. IN THE COURSE OF THIS PROCESS, FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS ARE USED, AND A FORMAL SENSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IS MAINTAINED. OVERTURNING THESE ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES BY CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MEANS, AT THIS TIME, SEEMS DOUBTFUL, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
547	THE MOST FASCINATING FEATURE OF CHINA'S ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION (SHENGTAI WENMING) CONCEPT IS NOT ITS GOALS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE GOALS OF OTHER POST-MODERN VISIONS OF SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES, BUT ITS EXPLICIT EMBRACE OF BOTH MODERN AND TRADITIONAL MEANS AS ESSENTIAL FOR ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. THIS FEATURE OF THE CONCEPT HIGHLIGHTS A PARADOX THAT WOULD BE INHERENT IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION AS A PRINCIPLE OF GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE IN SOCIETIES WHERE A STRONG RULE OF LAW REMAINS ASPIRATIONAL. FORTUNATELY, THE ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION CONCEPT ALSO SEEMS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WITH SOCRATIC OVERTONES THAT WOULD HELP ALL SOCIETIES TO LEARN HOW TO CRAFT BLENDS OF BOTH MODERN AND TRADITIONAL MEANS OF BUILDING AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A STRONG RULE OF LAW.
548	CHINA IN THE CONTEMPORARY ERA IS EXPERIENCING A RADICAL SOCIAL REVOLUTION, WHICH SOME CONSIDER UNPRECEDENTED IN THE PAST 3,000 YEARS. THE COUNTRY FACES A SERIES OF ISSUES CONCERNING POLITICS AND LAW, GENERATED BY THE COMPLEX CONVERSION FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THE NEW ONE. WE MUST KEEP THIS HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN VIEW WHEN WE CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF LAW AND RELIGION.
549	BANGLADESH, THIRD LARGEST MUSLIM POPULATED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, RECENTLY FACED A FRIGHTFUL AND DREADFUL MILITANT ATTACK. THE MILITANT MOVEMENT IN THE COUNTRY IS THE DEADLIEST BUT NOT THE VERY FIRST. AS A LIBERAL MUSLIM COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, THE AUGMENTATION OF ISLAMIC RADICAL MOVEMENT IS NOT DESIRED. BUT THE INEQUALITY AND THE INCREASEDRACISM THAT SPREADS INTO THE VEINS OF EVERY PART OF THE SOCIETY ARE THE MAIN REASON BEHIND THE MOVEMENT. POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION AND ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE KEY FACTORS BEHIND THE MILITANCY AND RADICAL MOVEMENT IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE WILL ANALYZE THE KEY FACTORS BEHIND THE ISLAMIC MILITANT MOVEMENTS IN BANGLADESH WITH SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, CURRENT LAW AND ORDER SITUATION, POLITICAL UNREST ALONG WITH SOCIAL INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY TO NAME JUST A FEW. THE WAY TO FIGHT AGAINST ISLAMIC MILITANCY MUST BE BY ISLAM, NOT BY PERMUTING IT. THE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC IMPARTIALITY HAS TO BE ENSURED TO WIN THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM AND ALSO POLITICAL STABILITY HAS TO BE KEPT FOR A LONG TIME.
550	WE REVISIT THE BARRY, PEAVY AND RODRIGUEZ (1998) PAPER AND INVESTIGATE THE UNDERLYING SOURCE OF EMERGING MARKET PERFORMANCE BENEFITS. WE CLASSIFY STOCKS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVESTABILITY AND LEGAL ORIGIN. EMERGING MARKETS CONTINUE TO REPRESENT THE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS THEY HAD DURING THE BARRY ET AL. (1998) PERIOD BY PROVIDING NOT ONLY RETURN ENHANCEMENT BUT PRIMARILY RISK-REDUCTION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE FIND THAT AN INVESTOR CAN ACHIEVE GREATER BENEFITS BY FOCUSING ON A LIMITED SET OF EMERGING MARKETS WITH A FRENCH CIVIL LAW FOUNDATION AND THAT ARE MODERATELY INVESTABLE STOCKS.

551	ECONOMIC CONSTITUTIONS MAY BE 'SUBSTANTIVE', SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC POLICIES OR 'THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE' IN RELATION TO ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, OR 'COMMUNICATIVE', ESTABLISHING INSTITUTIONS FOR ECONOMIC ORGANISATION AND HOLDING THESE ACCOUNTABLE. IN THE CONTEXT OF FISCAL POLICY THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT IMPORTANT SUCCESSES FOR THE 'SUBSTANTIVE' MODEL THROUGH THE USE OF BALANCED BUDGET RULES, BUT A MORE 'COMMUNICATIVE' APPROACH CAN BE SEEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FISCAL COUNCILS. SIMILAR MOVES TO A MORE 'COMMUNICATIVE' MODEL CAN BE FOUND IN MONETARY POLICY AND IN THE REGULATION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES, INCLUDING IN EU LIBERALIZATION. IF SUCH A MOVE IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED NEED INDEPENDENCE, THOUGH THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH COMPLETE AUTONOMY OF DECISION-MAKING AS DECISIONS WILL OFTEN NEED TO BE TAKEN WITHIN A BROADER FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNMENT POLICY. THE 'COMMUNICATIVE' MODEL IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE ONE FOR AN ECONOMIC CONSTITUTION IN COMPLEX MODERN ECONOMIES.
552	WHAT IS THE ROLE OF LEGAL LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE POWER, IF ANY, WHEN CITIZENS DEMAND MORE SECURITY FROM TERRORISM, AND ALLOWING EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS LEGAL FLEXIBILITY OF ACTION APPEARS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IT? WE DEVELOP A GAME-THEORETIC MODEL TO SHOW THAT WHEN THE EXECUTIVE FACES INCREASED ELECTORAL INCENTIVES TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND HAS LEGAL FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE ANY POLICY IT FINDS OPTIMAL, SECURITY FROM TERRORISM CAN ACTUALLY DECREASE. IN CONTRAST, WHEN THE EXECUTIVE FACES INCREASED ELECTORAL INCENTIVES TO PROVIDE SECURITY AND THERE IS AN EXPLICIT LEGAL LIMIT ON EXECUTIVE COUNTERTERRORISM ACTIVITIES, SECURITY FROM TERRORISM INCREASES. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE EXECUTIVE ACHIEVES THE OBJECTIVE OF TERRORISM PREVENTION MORE EFFECTIVELY WHEN THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS ON ITS COUNTERTERRORISM POWERS. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A SECURITY RATIONALE FOR LEGAL LIMITS ON EXECUTIVE POWER AND HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO DESIGN THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF LIBERAL GOVERNMENTS WHEN THE SOCIAL OBJECTIVE IS TERRORISM PREVENTION.
553	THE PAPER ADDRESSES THE PHENOMENON OF CIVIL SOCIETIES TURNING INTO UNCIVIL SOCIETIES AND THE CAPACITY OF CIVIL SOCIETIES FOR SELF-REPAIR. CONFRONTED WITH THE RECENT EVENTS OF THE RISE AND FALL OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE "ARAB SPRING" AND IN THE UKRAINIAN MAIDAN MOVEMENT A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS OFFERED FOR ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH RISE AND FALL. IT STARTS WITH THE PARADOX THAT PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC DEBATE EQUALLY PRODUCES CIVIL AND UNCIVIL OUTCOMES, THUS TAKING UP THE CLASSIC THESIS OF THE "FALL OF REASON" FORMULATED IN THE TRADITION OF "CRITICAL THEORY" ON THE "DIALECTICS OF ENLIGHTENMENT". SUCH "DIALECTICS" RESULTS FROM THE INTERPLAY OF THREE MECHANISMS THAT SHAPE THE MAKING OF A CIVIL SOCIETY: THE RULE OF LAW, THE MARKET AND THE FORUM. THESE MECHANISMS HAVE THEIR SPECIFIC HISTORICAL LEGACY IN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY. CIVIL SOCIETY PRAISED BY SOME AS THE OUTCOME OF THE RULE OF LAW, BY OTHERS AS THE OUTCOME OF FREE MARKETS AND BY OTHERS AS THE OUTCOME OF FREE SPEECH, EMPIRICALLY DOES NOT STAND UP TO THESE NORMATIVE EXPECTATIONS. THESE MECHANISMS PRODUCE "PERVERSE EFFECTS", GRASPED BY THE METAPHOR OF MONSTERS REPRESENTING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MARKET: LEVIATHAN (THE PERVERSE EFFECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW) AND BEHEMOTH (THE PERVERSE OF THE MARKET). THESE PERVERSE EFFECTS CUMULATE IN THE EMERGENCE OF UNCIVIL SOCIETY AS THE APOTHEOSIS OF UNREASON. FASCISM IS A CASE FOR THE PERVERSE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AND POLITICAL MOBILIZATION OF PEOPLE. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE THIRD MONSTER, I WILL PUT FORWARD THE ARGUMENT THAT THE FORUM WORKS NOT ONLY AS MECHANISM OF REPAIRING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MARKET, BUT ALSO AS A "MECHANISM OF SELF-REPAIR" OF CIVIL SOCIETY.
554	THE POLITICS OF LAND IN THE PACIFIC ARE ENTWINED WITH THE POLITICS OF CUSTOM, AND BOTH ARE ENTWINED WITH THE POLITICS OF ISLAND GOVERNANCE. THE ARRIVAL OF EUROPEANS HEIGHTENED THESE POLITICS, AND THE APPLICATION OF EUROPEAN CONCEPTIONS OF THE SOVEREIGN STATE MODIFIED THEM IN WAYS THAT CHANGED THE EXPRESSION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS ON THE LAND. THIS ASPECT OF HUMAN TERRITORIALITY-THE CONTROL OVER NATURAL RESOURCE ACCESS AND USE-IS COMMONLY OVERLOOKED IN ANALYSES OF STATE FORMATION. YET IT IS ESSENTIAL IN UNDERSTANDING THE EFFICACY OF STATE POWER, ESPECIALLY IN THE PACIFIC. PACIFIC ISLAND STATES WERE GENERALLY CREATED UNDER COLONIAL RULE AND THROUGH COLONIAL APPLICATIONS OF INDIRECT RULE. BUT INDIRECT RULE ALSO CREATED THE STATE'S DEPENDENCE ON THE CHARACTER OF CUSTOM AND, THEREBY, REINFORCED A BASIC TENSION UNDERMINING STATE AUTHORITY: BY PROTECTING THE LOCAL CONTROL OF LAND, IT LIMITED STATE CAPACITIES TO ARTICULATE AND ENFORCE THE RULE(S) OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WAY THIS TENSION WAS MEDIATED IN SAMOA, EAST AND WEST OF A LINE OF PARTITION. IT IS CONCERNED PRINCIPALLY WITH TRACING THE EVOLUTION OF FORMAL POLITICAL RELATIONS, INSTITUTIONS, AND PROCESSES EFFECTING PATTERNS OF TERRITORIAL CONTROL, AND WITH UNDERSTANDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TERRITORIAL CONTROL, POLITICAL AUTONOMY, AND THE CAPACITY TO REGULATE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES.

555	PHAN CHAU TRINH (1872 - 1926) WAS A CULTURALIST, EDUCATOR, PATRIOT, AND GREAT THINKER OF THE VIETNAMESE NATION. IN THE FIELD OF IDEOLOGY, PHAN CHAU TRINH IS A PERSON WITH PROGRESSIVE AND INNOVATIVE IDEAS, HAVING A PROFOUND INFLUENCE ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC LIFE, AND IS ONE OF THE TYPICAL REPRESENTATIVES OF A TUMULTUOUS HISTORICAL PERIOD IN VIETNAM AT THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY AND THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIETNAM OVER THE PAST 35 YEARS IS REMARKABLE. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORMS SINCE 1986 HAVE SPURRED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, RAPIDLY TRANSFORMING VIETNAM FROM ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TO A LOW-MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRY. DUE TO EXTENSIVE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, VIETNAM'S ECONOMY WAS MASSIVELY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BUT ALSO SHOWED CONSIDERABLE RESILIENCE. VIETNAM IS ALSO WITNESSING RAPID CHANGES IN POPULATION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE. IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERTWINED OPPORTUNITIES, CHALLENGES, AND ADVANTAGES, PHAN CHAU TRINH'S BASIC CONCEPTIONS OF THE LAW'S ROLE, ASSOCIATING WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AND PERFECTING OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE IN VIETNAM, REMAIN THE VALUE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FROM THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH, POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY, THROUGH THE STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL RECORDS AND OTHER RELATED DOCUMENTS, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON RESEARCHING THE BASIC CONTENT IN PHAN CHAU TRINH'S VIEWS ABOUT THE ROLE OF LAW, THEREBY LINKING TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND PERFECTING OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE IN VIETNAM TODAY.
556	ACROSS SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, NEW DEMOCRACIES EMERGE ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE STATES. USING AGGREGATE INDICATORS OF DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE PLUS NEW PUBLIC OPINION DATA, THE AUTHORS SHOW WHICH ASPECTS OF STATE BUILDING ARE MOST IMPORTANT. THE SCOPE OF STATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE DELIVERY OF WELFARE SERVICES HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON DEMOCRATIZATION. BUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A RULE OF LAW-AS EXPERIENCED THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN PERSONAL SECURITY AND THE POPULAR PERCEPTION THAT LEADERS RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION-IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING DEMOCRACY. BUT BECAUSE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE IS ITSELF A RECIPROCAL PRODUCT OF DEMOCRATIZATION, STUDIES OF AFRICAN STATES AND REGIMES, PRESENTLY SEPARATED, SHOULD BE CONNECTED.
557	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE WORK OF NASSER HUSSAIN AND KEALLY MCBRIDE TO THINK ABOUT THE WAY THAT LAW IS VIOLENT. HUSSAIN'S WORK SHOWS THAT THE LAW'S MUCH VAUNTED DISTINCTION BETWEEN ORDINARY LAW AND THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS A FALSE DICHOTOMY, ONE THAT STEMS FROM BRITAIN'S COLONIAL LEGACY WHEREIN ONLY BRITAIN WAS SAID TO FOLLOW "THE RULE OF LAW" AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD (INCLUDING AREAS THAT IT THEREFORE GOT TO COLONIZE) WERE SUBJECT TO A PERPETUAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. HUSSAIN SHOWS HOW THIS BINARY SERVES TO MAKE BRITISH RULE SEEM BENIGN AND PALATABLE EVEN AS IT DISGUISES THE WAY THAT THE BRITISH STATE WAS VIOLENT, NOT ONLY IN THE COLONIES BUT ALSO IN THE METROPOLE. BY LOOKING FURTHER AT THE PRACTICES OF "ORDINARY" LAW, I ARGUE VIA HUSSAIN AND MCBRIDE THAT PROCEDURE AND CODIFICATION, NOMINALLY THE BENIGN AND NONVIOLENT PRACTICE OF CREATING ORDER AND METHOD IN THE PRACTICE OF NON-EMERGENCY LAW, ARE THEMSELVES THOROUGHLY VIOLENT. HUSSAIN SHOWS THIS THROUGH HIS NOTION OF HYPERLEGALISM WHEREBY PLACES (SUCH AS GUANTANAMO) ARE SAID TO BE LAWLESS BUT ARE ACTUALLY SUFFUSED WITH VARIOUS FORMS OF ORDINARY LAW. MCBRIDE SHOWS THIS THROUGH HER STUDY OF THE LIFE WORK OF JAMES STEPHEN AND JAMES FITZJAMES STEPHEN, A FATHER AND SON WHO ADMINISTERED MUCH OF THE LEGAL PRACTICES OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY AND WHO WERE BOTH ESSENTIALLY THE EMBODIMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COLONIES. IN BOTH CASES, MORE FOR THE FATHER THAN FOR THE SON, ANY ATTEMPT TO RENDER THE RULE OF LAW NONVIOLENT MET WITH FAILURE. CODIFICATION BECAME THE WAY TO FORMALIZE AND DISGUISE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LAW PERPETUATES (RATHER THAN HOLDS BACK) THE VIOLENCE AND RACISM OF EMPIRE. IN THIS WAY PROCEDURE AND CODIFICATION ARE NOT JUST THE MEANS FOR STATE VIOLENCE BUT ARE THEMSELVES A FORM OF VIOLENCE, A KIND OF "LAW OF RULES," CONFORMING TO WHAT WALTER BENJAMIN CALLS "LAW PRESERVING VIOLENCE."
558	WHEN CARMEN GUADALUPE VASQUEZ WAS RUSHED TO [THE] HOSPITAL AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO A STILLBORN BABY BOY, THE DOCTORS FIRST TREATED HER LIFE-THREATENING BLEEDING AND THEN CALLED THE POLICE, WHO HANDCUFFED HER TO THE BED. IN EL SALVADOR, WHERE ALL ABORTION IS ILLEGAL AND EMERGENCY WARDS ARE TURNED INTO CRIME SCENES, THE CONFUSED, WEAK, AND DESPERATELY ILL 18-YEAR-OLD MAID WAS PLACED UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR TERMINATING HER PREGNANCY AND DRIVEN AWAY IN A POLICE VAN.(1)
559	FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS GUARANTEED BY INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, BUT COUNTRIES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THEIR VIEW OF THE MEANING OF "FREE EXPRESSION" AND BOW IT SHOULD BE PROTECTED. BEFORE THE EMERGENCE OF THE INTERNET, EACH COUNTRY COULD WORKABLY SET ITS OWN CEILING FOR THE PROTECTION OF EXPRESSION WITHOUT HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. THE BORDERLESS NATURE OF THE INTERNET MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DESPOTS AND DICTATORS TO LIMIT THE ACCESS OF THEIR CITIZENS TO INFORMATION FROM OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTRIES' BORDERS. BUT THE CONFLICT REPRESENTED BY THIS MEDIUM EXPRESSES ITSELF IN LEGITIMATE DISPUTES OVER THE APPLICATION OF NATIONAL LAW. EACH NATION MUST APPLY ITS OWN RULES OF LAW WITHOUT DIMINISHING THE FREEDOMS AVAILABLE TO CITIZENS OF OTHER STATES. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT NATIONS FOCUS ON APPLYING THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH SPEECH ORIGINATES, FOLLOWING THE VIEW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
560	HONG KONG'S FAIR AND EFFICIENT LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE BEDROCK OF ITS ECONOMIC SUCCESS. THE PRACTICE OF WESTERN LAW UNDERPINS HONG KONG'S ENTIRE FREE MARKET BY PROVIDING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD, DUE PROCESS, PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LEGAL CONTRACTS. MR. LEE, THE OUTSPOKEN CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF HONG KONG, WARNS OF THE POTENTIAL HARMFUL IMPACT OF CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997, PARTICULARLY THROUGH CORRUPTION AND NEPOTISM.
561	LEGAL AUTHORITIES GAIN WHEN THEY RECEIVE DEFERENCE AND COOPERATION FROM THE PUBLIC. CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE KEY FACTOR SHAPING PUBLIC BEHAVIOR IS THE FAIRNESS OF THE PROCESSES LEGAL AUTHORITIES USE WHEN DEALING WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. THIS REACTION OCCURS BOTH DURING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH LEGAL AUTHORITIES AND WHEN COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ARE MAKING GENERAL EVALUATIONS OF THE LAW AND OF LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE STRENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS INFLUENCE SUGGESTS THE VALUE OF AN APPROACH TO REGULATION BASED UPON SENSITIVITY TO PUBLIC CONCERNS ABOUT FAIRNESS IN THE EXERCISE OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. SUCH AN APPROACH LEADS TO A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS ABOUT VALUABLE POLICE PRACTICES, AS WELL AS HELPING EXPLAIN WHY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE POLICE AND COURTS HAVE NOT LED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS.
562	WHILE MONTESQUIEU (1689-1755) IS OFTEN REGARDED AS THE THINKER WHO DISCOVERED THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH OF HIS THEORY OF THE STATE IS SURPRISINGLY LIMITED. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT HIS MASTERPIECE, THE SPIRIT OF THE LAWS (1748), POINTS TO A THEORY OF THE NON-ARBITRARY STATE. MONTESQUIEU'S COMPARATIVE STUDY OF VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS DEMONSTRATES THAT MODERN LIBERTY DEPENDS ON THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE MANY STATES HAVE LAWS BUT FEW OF THEM GUARANTEE LIBERTY, HE STRESSED THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THE SEPARATION OF THE JUDICIAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS. THE CONSTITUTION OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL BRANCH SEPARATES THE SPHERE OF JUSTICE FROM THE POLITICAL SPHERE, WHICH CREATES THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE NON-ARBITRARY STATE. DEPENDING ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER IN EITHER OF THE TWO SPHERES, NON-ARBITRARY STATES CAN GUARANTEE THEIR CITIZENS MORE OR LESS LIBERTY. THE CONCEPT OF THE NON-ARBITRARY STATE THUS ILLUMINATES MONTESQUIEU'S SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE VARIETY OF POLITICAL PROJECTS THAT EMERGED IN THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS.
563	IN PUTIN'S RUSSIA, THE REGIME USES THE LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS TO FULFILL POLITICAL GOALS, TO COMMUNICATE THEM TO SOCIETY, AND TO MANAGE THE AUTHORITARIAN COALITION THAT HELPS THE PRESIDENT GOVERN. AS A RESULT, THE LAW IS HIGHLY CONSEQUENTIAL AND IMPORTANT, BUT ITS USE TENDS TO BE ARBITRARY, EXPEDIENT, AND INSTRUMENTAL, RATHER THAN PREDICTABLE AND PRINCIPLED. CAN WE EXPECT ANY MAJOR SHIFTS IN THE ROLE OF LAW AND THE COURTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS? RUSSIA'S LEGAL REGIME IS UNLIKELY TO UNDERGO MAJOR EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE AND MAY OUTLIVE PUTIN'S TENURE: BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC PRESSURES FOR CHANGE TOWARD CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE LIMITED. IF A POSITIVE SHIFT WERE TO TAKE PLACE, RUSSIA WOULD INCH TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM. BUT NEGATIVE CHANGE IS ALSO POSSIBLE. IF PUTIN'S REGIME WEAKENS, THE POLITICIZED USE OF THE COURTS AGAINST BOTH DISSIDENTS AND POLITICAL COMPETITORS WITHIN THE AUTHORITARIAN COALITION WILL INCREASE.
564	TERRORISM AND STREET CRIME HAVE GROWN TO ALARMING PROPORTIONS. YET INSTEAD OF TRYING TO STEM THE TIDE OF LAWLESSNESS IN CITIES LIKE MOSCOW AND ST. PETERSBURG, THE RUSSIAN SECURITY SERVICES DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO SUBDUING THE CHECHENS, FIGHTING WESTERN SPIES, HARASSING OUTSPOKEN JOURNALISTS, AND DEFEATING YELTSIN'S POLITICAL ENEMIES. FAR FROM BEING APOLITICAL GUARANTORS OF RUSSIA'S INTERNAL SECURITY, THE KGB'S SUCCESSORS ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN POWER POLITICS.
565	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES SOVEREIGNTY AND EXAMINES IN DETAIL HOBBES'S DEBATES WITH THE TWO LEADING LEGAL THEORISTS OF HIS DAY, COKE AND HALE, BOTH LORD CHIEF JUSTICES OF THE KING'S BENCH. I ARGUE THAT HOBBES CAME TO CHANGE HIS MIND SOMEWHAT ABOUT THE DESIRABILITY OF DIVIDED SOVEREIGNTY BY THE TIME, NEAR THE END OF HIS LIFE, THAT HE WROTE THE DIALOGUE. BUT I ALSO ARGUE THAT HOBBES SHOULD HAVE DEVELOPED MORE THAN A VERY THIN CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. HOBBES SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OPEN TO THE IDEAS THAT THE JURISTS OF HIS DAY WERE DEVELOPING, ESPECIALLY THE IDEA THAT THE JUDICIARY SHOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT STATUS.
566	THIS PAPER EVALUATES JURGEN HABERMAS'S TYPOLOGY OF ACTION AND HIS RECENT CALL FOR A RADICALLY DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE THEORY OF ACTION THAT HABERMAS DEVELOPS, HOWEVER, DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE SCIENCE OF ACTION (PRAXEOLOGY) OF THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOL. AS SUCH, IT REPRESENTS A METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGE TO AUSTRIAN PRAXEOLOGY. ADDITIONALLY, HABERMAS'S CRITICISM OF THE WELFARE STATE IS SHOWN TO BE SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT WITH HAYEK'S CRITICISMS, BUT HIS ALTERNATIVE TO THE WELFARE STATE CHALLENGES THE POLITICAL VISION OF MANY AUSTRIAN ECONOMISTS. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH HABERMAS'S AND THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOL'S EFFORTS SUFFER FROM SIMILAR WEAKNESSES AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL PRETENCES.
567	IN DEVELOPMENT POLICED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SHIFTED THEIR FOCUS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND SOUND INSTITUTIONS. THE THEORY BEHIND THIS IS THAT ONLY WITH A HIGH QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT (QOG) CAN A COUNTRY REAP THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. WE REVIEW THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS POLICY SHIFT AND OFFER A FIRST BENCHMARK STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE FIRST SECTION CONTAINS A REVIEW OF THE CONCEPTUAL DISCUSSION OF WHAT QOG MEANS. SECOND, WE PRESENT FOUR SALIENT APPROACHES PERTAINING TO THE OUTCOMES OF QOG: THE DEBATES CONCERNING QOG AND DEMOCRACY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, CORRUPTION, AND THE RULE OF LAW THE THIRD SECTION USES INSIGHTS GAINED FROM THESE DEBATES TO FOCUS ON THE POLICY OUTCOMES OF QOG-ITS EFFECTS ON SOCIAL WELL-BEING, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING POSSIBLE PITFALLS IN FUTURE RESEARCH ON QOG AND DEVELOPMENT.
568	IN THE 1990S, JAPAN OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED ITS FIRST LEGAL-ASSISTANCE PROJECTS IN ASIA, BECOMING THE FIRST ASIAN DONOR TO OFFER BILATERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE LEGAL FIELD IN THE POST-COLD WAR PROFILERATION OF RULE-OF-LAW ASSISTANCE MOVEMENTS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PROCESS OF RE-SHAPING THE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (ODA) POLICIES IN JAPAN LEADING UP TO THE ADOPTION OF THE ODA CHARTER IN 1992 AND ITS SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE THE CHANGES IN IMPORTANCE AND RELEVANCY OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN THE OVERALL JAPANESE FOREIGN-AID POLICY OVER THE YEARS. THE PAPER ALSO ARGUES THAT JAPAN'S RULE-OF-LAW ASSISTANCE PROJECTS WERE INITIALLY LAUNCHED WITH PRAGMATIC CONSIDERATIONS BUT HAD TO BE CONTINUOUSLY JUSTIFIED FOR THEIR SUSTAINABILITY WITH INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS AND PRACTICAL RESPONSES TO RESPOND TO THE CHANGING TRENDS OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION AND NATIONAL POLITICAL PRESSURES.
569	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON CULTURE AND RULE OF LAW IN INDONESIA, WHICH PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT CASE STUDY IN COLONIALISM AND POST-COLONIALISM. THE COLONIAL HERITAGE OF THE INDONESIAN ISLANDS GOES BACK TO THE EARLY 1500S AND LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR CENTURIES (SCHULTZ 2002: 144-145) UNTIL INDEPENDENCE WAS DECLARED IN AUGUST 1945 (GOGWILT 1996: 158). THIS EARTH OF MANKIND BY PRAMOEDYA ANANTA TOER IS AN APPROPRIATE TEXT THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THE ISSUES SURROUNDING COLONIALISM AND POST-COLONIALISM BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE STRUGGLE OF A NATIVE INDONESIAN WITH VARIOUS COLONIAL INSTITUTIONS AT THE TURN OF THE 19TH CENTURY; THESE STRUGGLES HAVE BEEN CHRONICLED BY AN AUTHOR WHO LIVED THROUGH COLONIAL RULE, JAPANESE OCCUPATION, AND LIBERATION. IN ADDITION, THE NARRATIVE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE PARMOEDYA1 HAD BEEN IMPRISONED BY THE COLONIAL DUTCH, AND THEN AGAIN BY INDONESIAN AUTHORITIES, FOR HIS LITERARY ACTIVITIES (SAMUELS 1999). THIS EARTH OF MANKIND, PERHAPS PRAMOEDYA'S MOST POPULAR NOVEL, WAS WRITTEN (MORE ACCURATELY `RECITED') DURING HIS FOURTEEN-YEAR IMPRISONMENT ON BURU ISLAND (LANE 1991). PRAMOEDYA HAS WON SEVERAL WRITING AWARDS (GOGWILT 1996: 149), AND HAS BEEN NOMINATED SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE NOBEL PRISE IN LITERATURE (BBC NEWS 2006). HE `HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNISED AS INDONESIA'S MOST SIGNIFICANT LITERARY VOICE' (GOGWILT 2003: 217).
570	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION ON CORPORATE INNOVATION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TO TESTIFY THESE HYPOTHESES, WE USE FIRM-LEVEL DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK ENTERPRISE SURVEY, AND COUNTRY-LEVEL INFORMATION FROM WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS REPORTS. THE FINAL DATA SET CONSISTS OF 24,166 FIRM OBSERVATIONS, FROM 41 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FINDINGS BY USING A WIDE RANGE OF CONTROL VARIABLES, THE RESULTS PROPOSE THAT WELL-ORGANIZED LEGAL INSTITUTIONS STIMULATE CORPORATE INNOVATION . MORE PRECISELY, A STRONG RULE OF LAW, EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT AND PROTECTED PROPERTY RIGHTS ENCOURAGE FIRM-LEVEL INNOVATION. COUNTRIES' RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES TO SOLVE DISPUTES BETWEEN PARTIES AND PROVIDE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS IN CASE OF INNOVATION REPLICATION. RULE OF LAW ALSO DIRECTS THAT RULES MADE BY POLICYMAKERS TO SECURE THE RIGHTS OF INNOVATORS ARE WELL ENFORCED. MOREOVER, STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS ENSURE INNOVATORS THAT THE INNOVATIONS ARE PROTECTED, AND IN CASE OF ANY INFRINGEMENT, THE GUILTY PARTY WILL BE PUNISHED AND FINED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF ALL EFFECTIVE ASPECTS LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION ON CORPORATE INNOVATION AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. SUCH SECURITY TO PREVENT UNLAWFUL DUPLICATION WILL ULTIMATELY INCREASE INNOVATION.
571	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES IF LEGAL ORIGINS AND GOVERNANCE IMPACT LENDING BY BANKS IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF LOW-AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES FOR 2004 TO 2017. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT COUNTRIES WITH BRITISH LEGAL ORIGIN, THE STRENGTH OF THE LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND REGULATORY QUALITY ARE POSITIVELY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH THE CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE BANKS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE ESTIMATIONS BASED ON DATA FOR THE POST-GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS REVEALED THAT IN COUNTRIES WITH BRITISH LEGAL ORIGIN, THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY MATTERED INTENSELY IN THE BANKING SECTOR'S CREDIT. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN AND IMPROVE THEIR GOOD GOVERNANCE PRACTICES AND IMPROVE ON CONTRACT ENFORCEMENTS TO ALLOW MAXIMUM LEVERAGE PRACTICES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE THAT CAN POSITIVELY INFLUENCE CREDIT DIFFUSION BY THE BANKS.
572	SOCIAL TRUST IS LINKED TO MANY DESIRABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES. USING NEW DATA FROM A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 2668 SWEDISH EXPATRIATES, WE EXAMINE THE ROBUSTNESS OF HIGH SOCIAL TRUST IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INDIVIDUAL TRUST DECREASES WITH LENGTH OF STAY IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH CORRUPTION AND LOW RULE OF LAW. THE EFFECT IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND DRIVEN BY EXPATRIATES WHO WERE AGED 30 YEARS OR BELOW UPON ARRIVAL TO THE NEW COUNTRY. WHILE OTHER STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT TRUST AMONG MIGRANTS ADAPTS TO DESTINATION COUNTRY TRUST LEVELS, WE FIND THAT AFTER THE (APPROXIMATE) AGE OF 30, HIGH TRUST IS A STICKY PERSONALITY TRAIT. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR A LARGE ARRAY OF INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS (INCLUDING AGE) AND SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT SOCIAL TRUST IS SENSITIVE TO EVENTS THAT OCCUR EARLY IN LIFE.
573	CONTEXTUAL REVIEW IS A JUDICIAL METHOD THAT REJECTS DOCTRINAL OR CATEGORICAL METHODS TO GUIDE JUDICIAL SUPERVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. JUDGES ARE INVITED TO ASSESS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A CLAIM IN THE ROUND WITHOUT ANY DOCTRINAL SCAFFOLDING TO CONTROL THE DEPTH OF SCRUTINY; IN OTHER WORDS, INTERVENTION TURNS ON AN INSTINCTIVE JUDICIAL IMPULSE OR OVERALL EVALUATIVE JUDGEMENT. THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES AND EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS INSTANCES WHERE THIS METHOD IS DEPLOYED IN JUDICIAL REVIEW IN ANGLO-COMMONWEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE EFFICACY OF THIS STYLE OF REVIEW IS ALSO EVALUATED, USING RULE OF LAW STANDARDS TO FRAME THE ANALYSIS. ITS INCREASING POPULARITY IS A WORRYING TURN, IN PART BECAUSE ITS RELIANCE ON UNSTRUCTURED NORMATIVISM UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW.
574	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES WHETHER THE BILL N. 2.633/20 FAVORS LAND GRABBING OR WHETHER IT HELPS TO COMBAT ILLEGAL APPROPRIATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IT ADOPTS AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THE NOTION OF ILLEGAL RULE OF LAW, WHICH PROMOTES PLUNDER, BY UGO MATTEI AND LAURA NADER. THE METHOD USED IN THE FIRST PART OF THE WORK IS NON -SYSTEMATIZED BIBLIOGRAPHIC AND IDENTIFIES THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM. AFTERWARDS, THE COMPARATIVE METHOD IS USED TO ASSESS THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF BILL N. 2.633/20 ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF PUBLIC LAND GRABBING, CONSIDERING AS REFERENCE THE CURRENT LAND POLICY. AS RESULTS OF THE STUDY, IT IDENTIFIES PARAMETERS FOR VERIFYING THE EFFECTIVENESS PROPOSED CHANGES, IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE WHETHER THE NORM IS ALIGNED WITH THE RULE OF LAW, OR, ON THE CONTRARY, TO THE PLUNDERING OF THE COUNTRY'S ASSETS AND RESOURCES.
575	SINCE 2018, A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN TO INTEGRATE LEADERSHIP BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY AS THE CORE FORCE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN CHINA HAS REVERSED THE COURSE OF MARKET REFORM IN THE PAST 40 YEARS, WHICH WAS PREDICATED ON SEPARATION OF THE PARTY'S POLITICAL FUNCTIONS FROM COMPANY BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE TREND OF DEVELOPMENTS FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE AND ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN ON CHINA'S SOCIALIST MARKET ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW CONDITIONS. SOME INSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS ARE ALSO EXAMINED IN THE COMPARATIVE CONTEXT WITH REFERENCE TO THE OECD CORPORATE PRINCIPLES. THE MAJOR ARGUMENT OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT ENHANCING THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP IN COMPANIES WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARKET ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS CHINA'S ATTEMPT TO CREATE AN INNOVATIVE SOCIETY FOR ITS ECONOMIC UPGRADING.
576	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES ENVIRONMENTAL DEMOCRACY AND THE NEED FOR POPULAR PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES INVOLVING GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS (GMOS), ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ESCAZU AGREEMENT. THEREFORE, THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH WERE ADOPTED. WE SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE LACK OF SUSTAINABLE PUBLIC POLICIES AND THE LACK OF ACCESS BY THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION TO PROCEDURES FOR APPROVING THE USE OF GMOS AND THE CONSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS. BASED ON THIS, THE HYPOTHESIS DEFENDED FOCUSES ON THE PERSPECTIVE THAT, AFTER BEING RATIFIED BY BRAZIL, THE ESCAZU AGREEMENT, COMBINED WITH BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, COULD BECOME AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT FOR STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL DEMOCRACY LINKED TO AGRIBUSINESS, USING THE CONCEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. IN THE END, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR POPULAR AWARENESS ABOUT THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ENVIRONMENTAL DEMOCRACY AND THE INDISPENSABILITY OF RATIFICATION OF THE ESCAZU AGREEMENT BY BRAZIL, NOTABLY TO REINFORCE THE GUARANTEE OF PROCEDURAL ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY.
577	WHILE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT (FD) HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED IN THE LITERATURE AS A DETERMINANT OF INFORMAL SECTOR SIZE, THERE HAS BEEN NO FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL STABILITY. WE FIND THAT THE STABILITY OF THE BANKING SECTOR HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND ROBUST NEGATIVE EFFECT ON INFORMALITY ACROSS COUNTRIES. USING A RECENTLY AVAILABLE TESTING METHODOLOGY BASED ON A HETEROSKEDASTICITY-ROBUST LASSO WE ALSO FIND STRONG SUPPORT FOR RULE OF LAW AS A KEY DETERMINANT OF INFORMAL SECTOR SIZE, AND SOME EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF FD.

578	THIS WORK ADDRESSES THE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES THAT THREATEN TO DERAIL COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS BY THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE LINKS BETWEEN VARIOUS PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 SECURITY ISSUES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE TERRORISM THREAT FACING MALAYSIA AT PRESENT. THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CURRENT COUNTERTERRORISM APPROACH BY THE GOVERNMENT ARE HIGHLIGHTED. IN ADDITION, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS SYSTEMIC CORRUPTION, WEAKNESSES IN BORDER SECURITY, AND INADEQUATE PRIVATE SECTOR REGULATION AS KEY AREAS OF CONCERN. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING THE SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SUCCESSFUL COUNTERTERRORISM CAMPAIGN AND THE RULE OF LAW.
579	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO GIVE THE FRISIAN JURIST ULRIK HUBER (1636-94) HIS PLACE IN THE EUROPEAN HISTORY OF THE NOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY OF THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY OF THE ROLE OF FUNDAMENTAL LAWS THEREIN. IN ORDER TO DO SO HUBER'S NOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WILL BE READ AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A EUROPEAN SKETCH OF THIS NOTION. HUBER'S IDEAS ON FUNDAMENTAL LAWS ARE TAKEN HERE FOR A DOOR THROUGH WHICH SOME AGE-OLD IDEAS ENTERED A NEW STAGE - AND WITH THESE AGE-OLD IDEAS A CORE CONCEPTION OF RULE OF LAW THINKING HAD KNOCKED ON THAT DOOR.
580	BRITISH COLONIAL POLICIES HAVE LED TO STRATIFIED SOCIETIES ALL OVER THE WORLD AND AMERICA IS NO EXCEPTION. BUT AMERICA IS UNIQUE IN TRANSITING TO AN EQUAL SOCIETY AND CONSTRUCTING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE A FAIR SOCIETY, EVEN THOUGH NOT COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL. WHAT DISTINGUISHES AMERICA FROM OTHER BRITISH COLONIES IS THE TRADITION OF RULE OF LAW. PERHAPS THIS TRADITION IS ALSO THE MOST PRICELESS HERITAGE THAT THE BRITAIN LEFT FOR AMERICA. CURRENTLY, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND RACIAL EQUALITY PROTESTS SPREAD ACROSS AMERICA. THIS BOOK PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE DIVIDED AMERICA.
581	IN AFRICA, A SEEMINGLY GROWING NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS BY PRESIDENTS TO OVERCOME OR ABROGATE TERM LIMITS, OR MAKE THEM OTHERWISE INEFFECTIVE, HAS IGNITED A DEBATE ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL ENGINEERING, AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, AND THE NATURE OF POLITICS IN GENERAL. IN LIGHT OF RECENT INSTANCES OF "THIRD-TERM BIDS," WE REVISIT THE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF POWER IN AFRICA AND CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTION THAT, OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, AFRICAN POLITICS HAVE EXPERIENCED A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AWAY FROM "BIG MAN" RULE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE STOCKTAKING OF THE STATE OF PLAY OF TERM LIMITS AND THIRD-TERM BIDS, WE ANALYSE BROADER TRENDS AND OUTCOMES OF LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ENGINEERING. WE ARGUE THAT AN ANALYSIS FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROCEDURES MISREPRESENTS THE EXTENT OF POLITICAL CHANGE BY IGNORING POWER AND AUTHORITY IN MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES. WHILE THE GROWING SALIENCE OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS IS UNDENIABLE, WE SUGGEST THAT THEY MATTER MORE AS A LEGITIMISATION OF THE POWER OF POLITICAL LEADERS THAN AS A CONSTRAINT TO IT.
582	THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN POLITICS AND LAW, AND THEREFORE ALSO BETWEEN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL STUDIES, IS IN THE AREA OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE STATE. STATE POWER PROVIDES LAW WITH ITS MANDATORY FORCE AND EFFECTIVENESS. LAW CONSTRAINS POLITICAL PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONALISES HUMAN RIGHTS. THE INFLUENCE OF POLITICAL INTERESTS IS EXPRESSED THROUGH LEGISLATIVE POLICY, WHILE THE LEGAL RATIONALISATION OF POLITICS IS EXPRESSED IN THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
583	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL BARRIERS TO INTRODUCING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE (RJ) IN HONG KONG. IT ARGUES THAT THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IN RJ MAY BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS REGARDED BY THE CITIZENS OF HONG KONG AS SACROSANCT IN THEIR RESISTANCE TO THE "MAINLANDIZATION" OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PRACTICES AFTER CHINA RESUMED SOVEREIGNTY OF HONG KONG. IT IS ARGUED THAT, BECAUSE IT COULD ADMIT SUCH POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CHINESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CONCEPTS AS "RULE BY THE PEOPLE," "ABSENCE OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE," "LENIENCY FOR SELF-CONFESSION AND SEVERITY FOR RESISTANCE," AND "TOEING THE PARTY LINE," RJ WOULD BE DEVOID OF ANY RESTORATIVE SUBSTANCE AND COULD BREACH THE PRINCIPLES OF DUE PROCESS.
584	NOWADAYS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IS FACING A DEEP CHANGE IN ITS THEORETICAL AND DOGMATIC BASES. WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AND THE OVERCOMING OF TRADITIONAL PARADIGMS, THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW MUST HAVE A METHODOLOGY THAT IS NO LONGER FORMALIST, BASED ON POSITIVIST CONCEPTIONS. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE IDEA OF STATE HORIZONTALITY, IN A CONCERTED ADMINISTRATION, IN WHICH THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, IN PRINCIPLE, ABDICATES TO IMPOSE YOURS OWN IMPERATIVE AND UNILATERAL CRITERIA WAY AND TRY TO FIND A BALANCE POINT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC INTERESTS AND THE PRIVATE INTERESTS. MOREOVER, THE PHENOMENON OF DE-JUDICIALIZATION OR EXTRAJUDICIALIZATION, IN WHICH FEATURED BY A SHIFT OF COMPETENCIES FROM THE JUDICIARY BRANCH TO EXTRAJUDICIAL ORGANS, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN SEVERAL FIELDS. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE INSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC ADVOCACY MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, FROM A JURIDICAL-POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW, OR IN THE PURSUIT OF ITS ROLE AND COMPETENCES, MECHANISMS THAT, FACILITATING DIALOGUES BETWEEN PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE CONTROVERSY, SEEK JUDICIAL CERTAINTY AND INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY.
585	MEXICO IS ENTERING A PHASE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. THIS CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE NUMEROUS REFORMS AND MEASURES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TO ADAPT THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SOME EXAMPLES SHOW AN INCREASED TENDENCY TO ADHERE TO AND ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS; TO RECOGNIZE THE OFFICIAL TRUTH OF AUTHORIZED MISCONDUCT THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE PAST; TO PUNISH PERPETRATORS, AND ABOVE ALL, TO ENSURE VICTIMS' RIGHTS TO TRUTH AND REPARATION. IF THESE TENDENCIES CONTINUE, IT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE RESTORATION OF PUBLIC TRUST IN THE AUTHORITIES AND PAVE THE WAY FOR RECONCILIATION BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE STATE. WHILE MANY EXPERIENCES OF TRADITIONAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN POST-AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXTS, THE CONVERGENCE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS USED IN THOSE TRADITIONAL CASES LEAD US TO SUGGEST THAT THESE MODELS COULD ALSO APPLY TO SOCIETIES IN TRANSITION, NOT FROM A PARTICULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT TO ANOTHER, BUT FROM A DEVELOPING DEMOCRACY INTO A LAW-ABIDING SOCIETY. IN THIS SENSE, A BOTTOM-UP APPROACH THAT AIMS AT ATTAINING TRUTH, REFORM AND CHANGE WILL BE NECESSARY TO BREAK A CYCLE OF IMPUNITY AND DEVELOP SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS THAT RESPECT AND ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
586	MICROECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY IS AT THE CORE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN MODERN MARKET ECONOMIES BECAUSE IT FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF CREATIVE-DESTRUCTION. THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS PROCESS IS NOT INFINITELY FAST, IS THE PRESENCE OF ADJUSTMENT COSTS, SOME OF THEM TECHNOLOGICAL, OTHERS INSTITUTIONAL. CHIEF AMONG THE LATTER IS LABOR MARKET REGULATION. WHILE FEW ECONOMISTS OBJECT TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LABOR MARKET REGULATION HINDERS THE PROCESS OF CREATIVE-DESTRUCTION, ITS EMPIRICAL SUPPORT IS LIMITED. IN THIS PAPER WE REVISIT THIS HYPOTHESIS, USING A NEW SECTORAL PANEL FOR 60 COUNTRIES AND A METHODOLOGY SUITABLE FOR SUCH A PANEL. WE FIND THAT JOB SECURITY REGULATION CLEARLY HAMPERS THE CREATIVE-DESTRUCTION PROCESS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE REGULATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENFORCED. MOVING FROM THE 20TH TO THE 80TH PERCENTILE IN JOB SECURITY, IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG RULE OF LAW, CUTS THE ANNUAL SPEED OF ADJUSTMENT TO SHOCKS BY A THIRD WHILE SHAVING OFF ABOUT 1% FROM ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH. THE SAME MOVEMENT HAS NEGLIGIBLE EFFECTS IN COUNTRIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
587	JUDICIAL ANALYTICS IS THE USE OF DATA TO MONITOR, UNDERSTAND AND PREDICT JUDICIAL BEHAVIOUR. THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON AND A CAUSE FOR BOTH CELEBRATION AND CONCERN. GIVEN THE UNIQUE ROLE OF COURTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR JUDICIAL ANALYTICS TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW, THERE IS A NEED TO REVIEW AND REVISE THE CURRENT INERTIA IN THE AUSTRALIAN REGULATORY APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE. THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR LAW AND OTHER DISCIPLINES, TO ASSIST AND GUIDE THE CREATION AND DISSEMINATION OF PREDICTIVE JUDICIAL ANALYTICS.
588	REGULATION BY INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, RATHER THAN MINISTRIES, IS BELIEVED TO RESULT IN BETTER POLICY OUTCOMES. YET THIS BELIEF REQUIRES ONE TO ACCEPT A COMPLEX CAUSAL CHAIN LEADING FROM FORMAL INDEPENDENCE TO ACTUAL INDEPENDENCE FROM POLITICS, TO POLICY DECISIONS, AND, ULTIMATELY, TO POLICY OUTCOMES. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZE THE LINK BETWEEN THE FORMAL AND ACTUAL INDEPENDENCE OF REGULATORY AGENCIES IN WESTERN EUROPE. NEW DATA ON THE APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVES OF THESE AGENCIES IS USED TO CREATE A PROXY FOR THE ACTUAL INDEPENDENCE OF AGENCIES FROM POLITICS. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT FORMAL INDEPENDENCE IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF ACTUAL INDEPENDENCE, BUT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS MATTER AS WELL.
589	WE PROPOSE AS A MAIN HYPOTHESIS THAT MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE THAT MEXICO CITY IS EXPERIENCING HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE PERVASIVENESS OF CORRUPTION, AND BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT INACTION AGAINST THIS PHENOMENON. LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALL, SEEM POWERLESS IN IMPOSING THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, IN THE MOST BASIC EVERYDAY URBAN PROBLEMS, SUCH AS TRAFFIC, LITTER, THE APPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC SPACES BY STREET VENDORS, INFORMAL AUTO CLEANERS, ADVERTISING COMPANIES AND THEIR "BILLBOARDS", THE ARBITRARY GATING OF COMMUNITIES AND THE BLOCKAGE OF ROADS, WITHIN OTHERS.
590	THE AUTHORS PROPOSE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORM IN ROMANIA BY ASSESSING WHETHER THE ROMANIAN CIVIL SERVANTS PERFORM THEIR DUTIES ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE. THE PAPER OFFERS A SOCIO-STATISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON THE INTERNALIZATION OF THE EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE PRINCIPLES, NAMELY, THE RULE OF LAW, OPENNESS TOWARDS CITIZENS, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBILITY IN A ROMANIAN CONTEXT, AFTER THE EUROPEAN UNION ACCESSION. DESIGNED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF MODERN THEORIES OF ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIOLOGY THAT SEE INTERNALIZATION AS A PROCESS OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING AND CHANGE, AND USING A RELEVANT SAMPLE OF ROMANIAN CIVIL SERVANTS, THE PAPER OFFERS IMPORTANT AND USEFUL RESULTS FOR THE FUTURE ROMANIAN POLICIES AND STRATEGIES IN AN INTEGRATED EUROPEAN ARENA.
591	TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY TARGETS, ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE FORMULATED RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES, AMONG WHICH DIGITALIZATION HAS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT IMPETUS FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION. BY USING THE IV-GMM TECHNIQUE, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION (REG) IN ASIAN COUNTRIES FROM 2003 TO 2019, AND FURTHER INVESTIGATES THE MODERATING EFFECT OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE DIGITAL ECONOMY HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON REG. MOREOVER, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW POSITIVELY MODERATE THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND REG. IN ADDITION, COMPARED TO DEVELOPING ASIAN COUNTRIES, THE PROMOTION EFFECT OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY ON REG IS MORE SIGNIFICANT IN DEVELOPED ASIAN COUNTRIES. FINALLY, IN TERMS OF REGIONAL HETEROGENEITY, THE IMPACTS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY ON REG ARE ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE IN EAST AND SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES. ASIAN COUNTRIES SHOULD ACTIVELY DEVELOP DIGITAL INDUSTRIES, BUILD A STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCE FINANCIAL SERVICES, AND ACHIEVE LOW-CARBON ENERGY TRANSITION IN THE REGION.
592	IN 2018, MASSIVE STREET PROTESTS AGAINST ITS CORRUPTION FORCED THE LONG-DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY IN ARMENIA TO RELINQUISH POWER TO ITS NEMESIS, WHO HIMSELF HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR LEADING PROTESTS TEN YEARS EARLIER. THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION EARNED THE NAME THE "VELVET REVOLUTION." THE NEW ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT HOSTED THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF THIS ESSAY AT A WEEK-LONG CONFERENCE ON ANTICORRUPTION POLICY IN YEREVAN, ITS CAPITAL, WITH JUDGES, PROSECUTORS, AND INVESTIGATORS SELECTED FOR THEIR INTEGRITY AND COMPETENCE. BASED ON THE ATTITUDES AND CONCERNS THEY EXPRESSED, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS REFLECTING YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THE ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT AND CORRUPTION AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VELVET REVOLUTION, THE AUTHORS SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER PARTICULAR BACKGROUND CONDITIONS AND/OR CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEACEFUL REBELLION WERE ESPECIALLY CONDUCIVE TO THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A MORE FULLY DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP, OPPOSED TO CORRUPTION AND COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LITERATURE ADDRESSING SUCH QUESTIONS IN OTHER NATIONAL CONTEXTS, THE AUTHORS FOUND A SIMILAR PATTERN OF BACKGROUND CONDITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS, LEADING TO THEIR CONCLUSION THAT SUCH ELEMENTS CAN INDEED FOSTER SUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD ASSESS FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN ARMENIA, AND DETERMINE HOW WIDELY THE LESSONS OF ITS EXPERIENCE CAN BE APPLIED.
593	FINNIS'S THEORY OF LAW DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN LAW IN THE FOCAL SENSE AND LAW IN THE LEGAL SENSE. LAW IN THE FOCAL SENSE IS LAW THAT PROMOTES THE COMMON GOOD. CITIZENS MAY APPEAL TO CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE IN DECIDING WHETHER TO OBEY A LAW. IN SHORT, THEY CAN USE THE FOCAL SENSE IN THEIR DELIBERATIONS. BUT JUDGES MUST APPLY THE LAW IN THE LEGAL SENSE. THIS DIVIDED VIEW OF LAW LEADS TO PROBLEMS. THE ARGUMENT FROM INCONSISTENT OBLIGATIONS SAYS THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT. WHEN A PERSON RIGHTLY DISOBEYS AN UNJUST LAW, AND A JUDGE 'RIGHTLY' PUNISHES THEM, THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO SPEAK WITH TWO VOICES, AND ENDORSE UNJUST PUNISHMENT. THE SECOND ARGUMENT IS THE ARGUMENT FROM AUTHORITY. THE SOURCE OF A JUDGE'S AUTHORITY IS THE COMMON GOOD. WHEN JUSTICE IS NOT DONE, THE SOURCE OF THE JUDGE'S AUTHORITY EVAPORATES. HOW SHOULD THIS BE RESOLVED? IF JUDGES MAY APPEAL TO CONSIDERATIONS OF JUSTICE, WE RUN INTO RULE OF LAW PROBLEMS. THUS, FINNIS APPEARS TO BE STUCK IN A DILEMMA: EITHER PERMIT JUDGES TO DO JUSTICE, AT THE COST OF THE RULE OF LAW, OR REQUIRE THEM TO APPLY THE LAW IN THE LEGAL SENSE, AT THE COST OF JUSTICE.
594	IN THE PAST DECADE, AN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON DEVELOPMENT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY PROMINENT IN DEVELOPMENT THINKING. HOWEVER, THE REFORM EXPERIENCE THUS FAR SUGGESTS THAT IF INSTITUTIONS INDEED MATTER FOR DEVELOPMENT, WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A FIRM UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO TRANSFORMS DYSFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. DRAWING ON CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF RULE OF LAW AND PROPERTY RIGHTS REFORMS, WE ARGUE THAT PATH DEPENDENCE THEORY CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON PAST FAILURES AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR FUTURE REFORMS.
595	THE YEAR 2012 BEGAN WELL FOR BANGLADESH. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WAS IMPRESSIVE, AND THERE WERE SOME NOTABLE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS THE STARTING OF THE WAR CRIMES TRIAL. HOWEVER, CORRUPTION REMAINED A PRESSING ISSUE, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY BECAME INCREASINGLY TENUOUS, AND THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT CONTINUED TO BE TURBULENT AND UNCERTAIN. MOREOVER, ISSUES REGARDING THE COUNTRY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH INDIA AND THE U.S. WERE POORLY RESOLVED.
596	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ETHIOPIA. IMPLICIT IN THE NOTION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IS THE FACT THAT THE JUDICIARY HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN RESOLVING DISPUTES IMPARTIALLY, ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW AND IN SETTING LIMITS TO POWER. YET IN ETHIOPIA THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOUGHT TO TAKE AWAY POWER FROM THE COURTS, PLACING THEM IN QUASI-JUDICIAL BODIES WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE. THE JUDICIARY HAS ALSO FAILED TO CHECK THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS ACTING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE LAW. THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE JUDICIARY HAS NOT YET DEFINED ITS ROLE; HAS NOT PROPERLY INTERPRETED THE CONCEPT OF SEPARATION OF POWERS; AND HAS NOT YET BECOME A KEY ORGAN FOR ENFORCING HUMAN RIGHTS. THE JUDICIARY HAS ABDICATED ITS CORE FUNCTION OF REVIEWING ACTS AND DECISIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES AND IS IN DANGER OF PAVING THE WAY FOR ARBITRARY AND UNCHECKED GOVERNMENT.
597	HAVING GENERALIZED FOR SOME YEARS, BOTH IN LEGAL THEORY AND IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, THE TERM 'GUARANTISM', THE AIM OF THE AUTHOR IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO INDIVIDUALIZE ITS LINGUISTIC USES CONSOLIDATED SO MUCH IN ITS PENAL MEANING, THE MOST REPUTABLE ONE, AS IN ITS MEANING MORE GENERAL OF GUARANTISM OF THE RIGHTS, FROM THE EXAM OF THE WRITINGS OF LUIGI FERRAJOLI AND OF NORBERTO BOBBIO, SCHOLARS TO WHOM ARE ATTRIBUTED THEM THE PATERNITY, RESPECTIVELY, OF AN AND ANOTHER GUARANTISM MEANING. A MORE AMBITIOUS OBJECTIVE, BESIDES, IS TO IDENTIFY - WITH THE INTENTION TO PRESENT THE GARANTISMO AS A GENERAL IDEA OF LAW AND OF THE POLITICS-THE LINKS BETWEEN BOTH NOTIONS OF THE GARANTISMO AND WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IN CALLING NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM, I.E. THE THEORETICAL MOVEMENT BUT ALSO ITS CONSOLIDATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SPECIFIC PRAXIS- THAT FROM THE SECOND POSTWAR PERIOD HAS MODIFIED RADICALLY THE STRUCTURES OF THE STATE THROUGH RIGID CONSTITUTIONALISM AND CONTROL OF CONSTITUTIONALITY. THE AUTHOR'S PURPOSE, CLEARLY NORMATIVE, IS TO PROVIDE REASONS IN FAVOUR OF THE IDEA THAT THE THEORETICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN GUARANTISM AND NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM HAS FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE FOR A BETTER GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS AS FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW.
598	MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS (MDBS) ARE ACCORDED IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES AS AGENTS OF THEIR MEMBER STATES AS JUSTIFIED BY FUNCTIONALIST ARGUMENTS. THEY ARE ALSO OPERATIONALLY HYBRID: THEY ARE ACTORS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT IN ADDITION TO BEING FUNCTIONAL AGENTS. NAVIGATING THE FUNCTIONALIST IMAGERY AND RELYING ON THE ARGUMENT THAT THEY ARE DELEGATED PURELY ECONOMIC PURSUITS (I.E. FINANCING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT), MDBS ARE ABLE TO ESCHEW ACCOUNTABILITY TO RIGHTS-HOLDERS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THEIR DECISIONS AND OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW APPROACHES HAVE SUCCEEDED IN INCREASING TRANSPARENCY, INSTILLING SELF-REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND PROVIDING FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW, THE ABSENCE OF EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF SUCH REVIEW MECHANISMS AND THE BROAD IMMUNITIES TO SUIT ENJOYED BY MDBS HAVE IMPEDED TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY TO RIGHTS-HOLDERS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IN SO FAR AS THEY ENGAGE IN PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCING OPERATIONS, MDBS AND THEIR CONSTITUENT ARMS SHARE THE FORM, FUNCTION AND RELATIONSHIPS OF AN ECONOMIC CORPORATION TO A LARGE EXTENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR IMMUNITIES SHOULD BE LIMITED TO RENDER THEM BOUND-LIKE ORDINARY CORPORATIONS- BY THE DOMESTIC NORMS WITH RESPECT TO RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE HOME AND HOST COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO RIGHTS-HOLDERS AND TO PROVIDE RECOURSE FOR WRONGDOINGS.
599	ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS CRUCIAL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, YET COMPARATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS AND NEW FIRM FORMATION. I TEST THE IMPACT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS AND CONTRACTING INSTITUTIONS ON HIGH-GROWTH-ASPIRATION (HGA) ENTRANTS USING THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) SURVEY DATA FOR 2000-2005. I FIND THAT PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR PROFOUND MARKET EXPANSION AND RULE OF LAW IS MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR HIGH JOB GROWTH. THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES IN ENFORCE A CONTRACT, THE NUMBER OF PROCEDURES TO START A BUSINESS, AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO START A BUSINESS ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ALL TYPES OF HGA ENTREPRENEURSHIP. A COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEM IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP COMBINING HIGH JOB GROWTH AND MARKET EXPANSION. THESE FINDINGS ADD NUANCE TO PRIOR STUDIES THAT TOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. (C) 2011 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
600	BACKGROUND: THE PAPER OFFERS THE ANALYSIS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL CERTAINTY PRINCIPLE AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN UKRAINE. BOTH ARE REGARDED IN CONNECTION TO THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE; THEIR COORDINATION IS SHOWN IN CASES WHEN THE APPLICATION OF RULE OF LAW IS REQUIRED TO PATCH THE HOLES OF IMPERFECT JUDICIAL SYSTEM FACING THE CHALLENGES OF THE ONGOING WAR. METHODS: THE METHODS OF LEGAL REASONING AND ANALYSIS ARE USED TO PRESENT THE MAIN APPROACHES TO LEGAL CERTAINTY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS TO THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE. ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE HELP OF COMPARATIVE METHOD THEIR MEANING AND INFLUENCE ON THE LEGAL PRACTICE ARE ESTABLISHED. THE METHOD OF ANALOGY IS USED TO PREDICT THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN UKRAINE.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: LEGAL CERTAINTY IS AN ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT PROVIDES PREDICTABILITY IN LEGAL REGULATION, THE CLARITY OF LEGAL NORMS, AND DEMANDS THE PROPRIATE WAY OF LEGAL ACTS ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS PROHIBITS RETROACTIVITY. IT CHALLENGES RESPECT TO THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS AND PROVIDES STABILITY IN LEGAL REGULATION. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE RIGHT TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS BENEFICIAL FOR THE LEGAL CERTAINTY AND VICE VERSA. WHEN LEGAL CERTAINTY IS VIOLATED DUE TO THE GAP IN LEGISLATION, UNCLARITY OF LEGAL NORMS OR CONTROVERSY OF LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS AND VIOLATED RIGHTS OF THE CLAIMANT COULD BE RESTORED, IF THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO COURT IS FULLY GUARANTEED. IT IS STATED THAT RES JUDICATA, A REQUIREMENT FOR LEGAL CERTAINTY IS A DEMAND THAT IS ALSO COMMON TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
601	GOVERNANCE, FROM THE DUAL ASPECT, POLITICAL AND LEGAL, PRESUPPOSES PARAMETERS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION THAT STRENGTHENS THE PRIVATE PUBLIC RELATIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE GENERAL INTEREST AND ATTENTION TO THE NECESSITIES OF CITIZENS, ALL WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN THIS DYNAMIC, THE ADMINISTRATIVE INACTIVITY IN FRONT OF NORMATIVE DUTIES OF ACTION WILL BE ADDRESSED UNDER NEW LEGISLATIVE STANDARDS COHERENTS WITH A GOOD ADMINISTRATION.
602	THIS STUDY IS FOCUSED ON THE LINKAGES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE FAMILIES AS DESCRIPTORS OF NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRSS) ISSUED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (IASB). WE CONSIDER SUCH ANALYSIS AS A CASE STUDY FOR THE MORE GENERAL ISSUE OF EXPLAINING THE PREFERENCES OF NATIONAL REGULATORS IN THE ADOPTION OF FOREIGN NORMS, RULES, STANDARDS AND PRACTICES. BY USING A DATASET OF 162 JURISDICTIONS AND DUMMY VARIABLES DESIGNED TO CAPTURE THE CURRENT STAGE OF IFRSS ADOPTION AND, RESPECTIVELY, THE TAXONOMY OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS, WE FIND THAT A FULL IFRSS ADOPTION IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE PRINCIPLES-BASED ON LEGISLATIVE MONO-SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, WE OBSERVE THAT A STRONG RULE OF LAW, WITH AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM OF PROPERTY RIGHTS REINFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS THE PRE-ADOPTION EXISTENCE OF A PRO-GROWTH SET OF PUBLIC POLICIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF IFRSS ADOPTION.
603	THE PAPER EXAMINES THE JUDICIAL CASE OF THE FORMER BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT LULA IN THE LIGHT OF INTERNATIONAL FAIR TRIAL OBLIGATIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR OF THOSE RELATING TO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY. IT ALSO STUDIES THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE LATTER WITH INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION. AFTER ANALYZING THE RELEVANT PRACTICE IT COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT BRAZIL INFRINGED THOSE FAIR TRIAL OBLIGATIONS AND, THEREFORE, THE INTERNATIONALLY-IMPOSED RULE OF LAW.
604	THIS TEXT REVIEWS THE LECTURE BY GUILLERMO O' DONNELL TO OBTAIN THE ACADEMIC DEGREE "DOCTOR HONORIS CAUSA" BY THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SAN LUIS, WITH THE EXPOSITION "ABOUT THE LAW, THE STATE AND DEMOCRACY". IN IT, THE AUTHOR CONDENSES SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRATIC STATE. EMBEDDED IN THIS ISSUE, IT REFLECTS A VERY CRITICAL OF WHAT HE CALLS "THE DIVORCE BETWEEN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL SCIENCE".
605	SINCE 1947, THE CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT HAS SET OUT THE LAWS THAT DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP. THROUGHOUT THE ACT'S VARIOUS ENACTMENTS, THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAS RECOGNISED THE RIGHT TO CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT, MEANING THE RIGHT FOR A CANADIAN CITIZEN TO PASS ON HIS/HER CITIZENSHIP STATUS TO HIS/HER CHILD BORN OUTSIDE OF CANADA. CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT IS A COMMONLY RECOGNISED PATH TO CITIZENSHIP IN MANY COUNTRIES. CANADA HAS RECENTLY CHANGED ITS APPROACH TO CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT AND HAS IMPOSED A ONE-GENERATION RULE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORY OF CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT, THE CURRENT REGIME GOVERNING THIS TYPE OF CITIZENSHIP ACQUISITION AND THEN EXAMINES HOW THESE LAWS COMPLY WITH CANADA'S INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. ULTIMATELY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CANADA'S NEW APPROACH TO CITIZENSHIP BY DESCENT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RENDER CHILDREN STATELESS, THUS VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW.
606	MANY FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED REGARDING AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES' SOURCES OF LEGITIMACY, BUT LAW PLAYS ONLY A MINOR ROLE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. DICTATORSHIPS AND THE RULE OF LAW MAY BE DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE, AS A STATE THAT FOLLOWS THE RULE OF LAW ALWAYS BINDS POLITICAL POWER TO THE CORRESPONDING QUALIFIED RIGHTS. AND YET, ALL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES ARE STRUCTURED BY LEGAL SYSTEMS, WHICH THEY NEED IN ORDER TO RULE. UNTIL THE PRESENT, HOWEVER, TWO ASPECTS HAVE REMAINED UNCLEAR: THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH LAW CAN ACT AS A SOURCE OF LEGITIMACY FOR AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES AND THE TYPES OF LAW THAT MIGHT GIVE RISE TO THIS LEGITIMISING FUNCTION. BECAUSE WE CANNOT ASSUME ONE SINGLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES, A TYPOLOGY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IS PRESENTED THAT INTEGRATES THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. THESE LEGAL FORMS ARE THEN LINKED TO VARIOUS TYPES OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES TO ILLUSTRATE THEIR COMPATIBILITY AND INHERENT CONFLICTS FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES CORRESPOND TO VARIOUS LEGAL SYSTEMS. IT ALSO BECOMES CLEAR THAT SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS ARE LINKED TO DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING STABILITY. THE EXPLORATORY CHARACTER OF THIS CONTRIBUTION ALLOWS FOR THE FORMULATION OF THESES AND HYPOTHESES WHICH COULD CONTRIBUTE TO STRUCTURING FUTURE EMPIRICAL STUDIES. IN THE CONCLUSION, THE QUESTION IS RAISED WHETHER LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES SHOW SIMILARLY AMBIVALENT EFFECTS AS IN THE CASE OF ELECTIONS. IN ELECTIONS, THE MORE THEY RESEMBLE DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS, THE MORE THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME'S SURVIVAL IS IN QUESTION. DOES AN ANALOGOUS INTERPRETATION THEN MEAN THAT A STRONG ORIENTATION TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW ENDANGERS THE LEGITIMACY AND SURVIVAL OF AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES?.
607	THIS ESSAY DEALS WITH THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE, ITS NATURE AND ITS EFFECTS ON POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PRINCIPLE VARIES ACCORDING TO DISTINCT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT: WHILE THE PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACIES IN EUROPE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY RESTRICTED THE APPLICATION AND IMPACTS OF MAJORITY RULE, THE PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA HAVE SEEN QUITE THE OPPOSITE. RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS HAVE REINFORCED THESE PATTERNS. IN SOME COUNTRIES, THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE HAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED OTHER KEY PRINCIPLES OF PLURALIST SYSTEMS AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND POLITICAL PRACTICE HAS EXCEEDED TOLERABLE LIMITS TO STILL BE CONSIDERED DEMOCRACIES. HOWEVER, BOTH THE ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL DEBATES, AS WELL AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE, HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY IMPERVIOUS TO THE INCREASING DISPARITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRESIDENTIAL REGIMES.
608	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CLASH BETWEEN THE LEGAL VISION OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND THE POLITICAL VISION. TWO CRISES ILLUSTRATE THIS: POLAND'S DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING AND THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS THE UNION FACES. ABSTRACT LAW IS CENTRAL TO WHAT THE EUROPEAN UNION IS AND HOW IT WORKS, BUT THE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL DIMENSIONS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION IS UNDERMINING THE EU FROM WITHIN AND LIMITING ITS ABILITY TO PROJECT ITS POWER BEYOND ITS BORDERS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLICATE THE CLASH BETWEEN EUROPE AS A COMMUNITY OF LAW, ON THE ONE HAND, AND EUROPE AS A POLITICAL PROJECT, ON THE OTHER, BY FOCUSING ON TWO CRISES. THE FIRST IS THE CRISIS THAT HAS ARISEN IN RELATION TO POLAND'S BACKSLIDING WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND CRISIS IS THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. THE TWO CRISES ARE INTERLINKED. AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION REQUIRES OF THE EU THE KIND OF SOLIDARITY, CONFIDENCE AND UNITY OF PURPOSE THAT HAS BEEN UNDERCUT BY POLAND'S RULE-OF-LAW CRISIS AND BY THE INADEQUACY OF EUROPEAN RESPONSES TO IT. THUS, BOTH CRISES UNSETTLE THE EU'S CONSTITUTIONAL SETTLEMENT, REVEALING THE POLITICAL LIMITS OF LEGAL INTEGRATION. WE FIND THAT, IF EUROPE'S LEADERS ARE TO BETTER ALIGN THE EU'S LEGAL ORDER WITH ITS POLITICAL GOALS AND CAPACITY TO ACT, THEN THEY WILL NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE, AND WORK WITHIN, THE CONSTRAINTS THE EU FACES AS A UNION OF NATION STATES.
609	WE INVESTIGATE THE CLAIM MADE BY PROPONENTS OF THE BIG-BANG STRATEGY THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IN AN ECONOMY IN TRANSITION CREATES ITS OWN DEMAND FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS TO PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS. OUR MODEL CONTAINS A GOVERNMENT ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES TO ACCOMPLISH OBJECTIVES THAT DEPEND ON PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND AGENTS WHO INTERPRET THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT AS INDICATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW. AGENTS, USING THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES AS AN INPUT TO THEIR DECISIONS, CHOOSE WHETHER TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVES. WE ESTABLISH CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES CHOSEN BY THE GOVERNMENT MAXIMIZES ITS BENEFITS, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY INDUCES THE CONSTITUENCY TO SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THESE CONDITIONS PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE ARGUMENT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIG-BANG POLICY. WHEN THESE CONDITIONS DO NOT HOLD, HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITIES THAT MAXIMIZES THE GOVERNMENT'S BENEFITS MAY HAVE ONLY A MINOR IMPACT ON SUPPORT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. TWO CHARACTERISTICS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THESE CONDITIONS: THE INITIAL LEVEL OF CRIME AND THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THE GOVERNMENT CHOOSES TO UNDERTAKE. WE PRESENT EXAMPLES SHOWING THAT THE INITIAL LEVEL OF CRIME HAS THE MORE DRAMATIC EFFECT ON SUBSEQUENT SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
610	THIS ESSAY AIMS AT EXPLAINING WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES DECLARED IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION REPRESENT - OR COULD REPRESENT. FIRST, THE WORK CONSIDERS THE NOTION OF A CONSTITUTION AND ITS MODELS, COMBINED WITH THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHOR GOES FURTHER AND EXAMINES THE IDEA OF FREEDOM, AS IT CHANGES DEPENDING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL FOLLOWED, BE IT DERIVED FROM THE FRENCH OR THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION. PRESENTING THE PREOCCUPATIONS OF DIFFERENT EXPERTS REGARDING A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, THE ESSAY COMPARES THEIR ARGUMENTS BEFORE CONSIDERING THE ELEMENTS OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION AND ITS PREAMBLE. IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS MADE CLEAR THE INFLUENCE OF BRAZILIAN HISTORY IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEANING OF DEMOCRACY AND REPUBLIC IN THE COUNTRY. FURTHERMORE, CONCEPTS SUCH AS "INDIVIDUAL", "CITIZEN", "CITIZENSHIP", "GOVERNMENT", "EQUALITY", "COMMUNITARIANISM", "SOLIDARITY", "COMMON GOOD","VOTE", AMONG OTHERS, ARE ALL PRESENTED AND UNDERSTOOD THROUGH THE LENSES OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE TO BUILD A WIDE-RANGING YET COMPREHENSIBLE NOTION OF DEMOCRACY AND REPUBLIC IN BRAZIL.
611	THIS PAPER INTENDS TO BUILD A CASE FOR A THIRD ALTERNATIVE THAT CAN RECONCILE THE TWO OPPOSING VIEWS OF DEMOCRACY, I.E., THE CONSENSUAL VS. THE ADVERSARIAL, THROUGH A REEXAMINATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF CHINESE TRADITIONAL THEORIES OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER LINKS THE RULE OF VIRTUE WITH CONSENSUAL POLITICS, AND THE RULE OF LAW WITH ADVERSARY POLITICS, BY FOCUSING ON THE ROLES OF VIRTUE AND LAW, AND THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THE ACQUISITION AND MAINTENANCE OF ORIGINAL AND UTILITARIAN DIMENSIONS OF POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, THE PAPER PROPOSES A HYBRID VERSION OF DEMOCRACY THAT WILL CONTINUE THE DUALIST POLITICAL TRADITION WHILE ENABLING NECESSARY POLITICAL MODERNIZATION.
612	THE MH17 DISASTER MAKES CLEAR THAT INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. THE WIDESPREAD SUPPORT IN UKRAINE FOR DEMOCRATIZATION AND RULE OF LAW PRESENTS WESTERN DEMOCRACIES WITH A STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY. THEY SHOULD LOOK BEYOND THEIR SHORT TERM INTERESTS AND DEVELOP A LONG TERM VIEW ON THEIR RELATIONS WITH UKRAINE AND RUSSIA. THEY SHOULD INVEST MORE IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CONFLICT PREVENTION. FINALLY: THE PROLIFERATION OF LONG-RANGE ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES HAS TO BE PREVENTED.
613	THIS ESSAY INVESTIGATES THE CONFUCIAN COSMOPOLITAN ASPIRATION. FIRST, IT EXAMINES THE NATURE OF COSMOPOLITANISM AND ITS DISTINCTION FROM UNIVERSALISM. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT COSMOPOLITANISM IS A PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINE THAT CONSISTS OF TWO CORE TENETS: (1) THE TENET THAT HUMANKIND IN WHOLE IS A SOCIAL-POLITICAL COMMUNITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW; EACH PERSON HAS GLOBAL DUTY AND OBLIGATION; (2) THE TENET THAT A COSMOPOLITAN WORLD SOCIETY IS ONE OF PEOPLES OF DIVERSE CULTURES THAT ARE CONSTELLATED INTO A COMMUNITY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. SECONDLY, IT EXPLORES CONFUCIAN COSMOPOLITANISM CONSISTING OF FIVE TENETS: (1) THE VISION OF HUMANKIND IN WHOLE AS A COMMUNITY; (2) THE CONCEPT OF ONE'S COSMOPOLITAN BELONGING; (3) THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL MORAL WORTHINESS OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND INVIOLABILITY OF HUMAN DIGNITY; (4) THE CONCEPT OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY OF HUMANITY; AND (5) THE ASPIRATION TO A WORLD SOCIETY OF PERMANENT PEACE. THIRDLY, IT DISCUSSES WHY WE MUST HAVE A COSMOPOLITAN READING, NOT A UNIVERSALISTIC READING, OF CONFUCIANISM.
614	THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS HOW UN MILITARY MEMBERS UNDERTAKING UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS SHOULD ENGAGE WITH CUSTOMARY OR INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS THAT THEY ENCOUNTER. THE RELEVANT GUIDANCE THAT EXISTS SUGGESTS THAT, AS A POLICY MATTER, INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DEAL WITH MATTERS OF SERIOUS CRIME BECAUSE OF THE DANGER THEY MAY VIOLATE BASIC RIGHTS, AND BECAUSE DEALING WITH SERIOUS CRIME IS A KEY PREROGATIVE OF THE STATE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A GROWING MOVEMENT AWAY FROM ADOPTING A UNITARY, STATE-CENTRIC RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY APPROACH, TOWARDS VIEWING THE RULE OF LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEGAL PLURALISM. USING THAT PERSPECTIVE, AND IN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MILITARY MEMBERS OF UN PEACE OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE CONFRONTED BY INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS DURING PEACE OPERATIONS, THIS PAPER MAPS THREE PRINCIPLES THAT UN MILITARY MEMBERS SHOULD APPLY WHEN DEALING WITH INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF UN PEACE OPERATIONS: GIVING DUE REGARD TO APPLICABLE INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS, MAINTAINING OVERSIGHT OF THE APPLICATION OF INFORMAL JUSTICE NORMS AND PRACTICES, AND AVOIDING CORRUPTING INFORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS.
615	THE UNITED STATES, LIKE MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TODAY, IS EXPERIENCING THE DISRUPTION OF TRADITIONAL PATTERNS OF GOVERNANCE AND THE BREAKING OF NORMS OF EVERYDAY BEHAVIOR. IF WE IDENTIFY THE NORMS OF GOVERNANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND IF WE CONSIDER THE NORMS OF EVERYDAY BEHAVIOR TO CONSTITUTE CIVILITY, THEN WE CAN APPROACH THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS BY ASKING HOW LAW AND CIVILITY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. I SURVEY AND DISCUSS THREE DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE LAW/CIVILITY RELATIONSHIP: LAW AND CIVILITY, LAW OR CIVILITY, AND LAW AS CIVILITY. EACH OF THESE UNDERSTANDINGS IS AN ANALYTICAL RESOURCE, AND AS SUCH, EACH UNDERSTANDING CAPTURES A FACET OF A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP AND PROVIDES A WAY TO THINK ABOUT OUR CURRENT AGE OF UNREST.
616	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT A "MANIFESTO" EXPLORING A METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO LEGAL ANALYSIS, RELYING UPON A MORPHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF IDEOLOGY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS EXPLORE IDEOLOGY WITHIN LAW AND LEGAL CULTURE. THEY EXAMINE ONE SUCH IDEOLOGY - RULE OF LAW - AND CONSIDER HOW THIS CAN SHAPE JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING. THEY SUGGEST TECHNIQUES BY WHICH SUCH INFLUENCES CAN BE IDENTIFIED. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS MAKE FOUR FINDINGS. FIRST, FOLLOWING FREEDEN, IDEOLOGY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A UBIQUITOUS FORM OF POLITICAL THINKING WHICH SEEKS TO FIX THE MEANINGS OF ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPTS. SECOND, IDEOLOGY IN THIS SENSE FORMS AN IMPORTANT PART, BUT IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE WIDER NOTION OF LEGAL CULTURE. CONSIDERING IDEOLOGY IN LAW AS A SUB-SYSTEM OF LEGAL CULTURE CAN THEREFORE BE FRUITFUL IN PROVIDING A RICH UNDERSTANDING OF INTERPRETIVE DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE JUDICIARY. THIRD, RULE OF LAW AS AN IDEAL IS ITSELF IDEOLOGICAL, AS IT COMPRISES CONTESTED CONCEPTS SUCH AS CERTAINTY, EQUALITY, STABILITY AND LEGALITY. IT CAN BE CONSIDERED TO CONSTITUTE AN INTERNAL IDEOLOGY OF LAW AND IT CAN BE ANALYSED HOW THE CONCEPTS ARE DE-CONTESTED IN INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS. FINALLY, UNDERSTANDING THIS CAN HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF JUDGMENTS IN AREAS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION AND POLITICAL CONTESTATION, SUCH AS PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, AS IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND HOW ANY PARTICULAR JUDGE SEES THE ROLE OF THE COURT IN ITS WIDER POLITICAL CONTEXT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE ORIGINALITY OF THE AUTHORS' APPROACH LIES IN THE DRAWING TOGETHER OF METHODOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES AND UNDERSTANDINGS OF IDEOLOGY IN, AND IN RELATION TO, LAW.
617	THE CURRENT STUDY TRIES TO SUMMARIZE THE LEADING FACTORS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARD THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ENVIRONMENT-DEVELOPMENT LINKAGE IN CHINA'S ECONOMY COVERING THE PERIOD OF 1984-2018. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE PROPOSED OBJECTIVES, THE CURRENT STUDY USES THE DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE AND CANONICAL CO-INTEGRATION REGRESSION WITH GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT THERE EXISTS AN INVERTED U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP IN CHINA'S ECONOMY. LIKEWISE, URBANIZATION POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTES TO ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION. FURTHERMORE, THE HEALTH EXPENDITURES ALSO CAUSE TO DETERIORATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. IN CONTRAST, THERE EXISTS THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND CARBON EMISSIONS, WHILE THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S ECONOMY DOES NOT SECURE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THEREFORE, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION POLICIES NEED TO BE REVISED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT, WE RECOMMEND THAT CHINA CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS ECONOMY AND INVEST IN HEALTH CARE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES.
618	IN THE AFTERMATH OF GENOCIDE, LEGAL RECONSTRUCTION OFTEN INVOLVES EFFORTS TO MOVE TOWARD, OR BACK TOWARD, DEMOCRACY AND A COMMITMENT, OR RECOMMITMENT, TO THE RULE OF LAW. SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND PERHAPS MORE URGENTLY, THE NEED TO AVOID A RECURRENCE OF MASS ATROCITY REQUIRES STRICT, AND OFTEN ANTIDEMOCRATIC, SECURITY MEASURES. IN THE YEARS SINCE THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE, THE RWANDAN GOVERNMENT HAS ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO COMPETING INTERESTS, BUT MORE RECENTLY, ANTIDEMOCRATIC SENTIMENTS SEEM TO HAVE WON OUT OVER DEMOCRATIC ONES. USING THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WORKING FOR THE RWANDAN PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE AS A FRAME FOR ANALYSIS, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE 2003 RWANDAN CONSTITUTION (CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA, 2003) AND THE 2015 RWANDAN CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ALLOWING PRESIDENT PAUL KAGAME TO RUN FOR A PREVIOUSLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL THIRD TERM IN OFFICE, AND ATTEMPTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE SUCCESSES, CHALLENGES, AND CONTROVERSIES THAT RWANDA HAS FACED IN ITS EFFORTS TO SATISFY BOTH THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND ITS NEED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY.
619	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO INVESTIGATE NUANCES IN RECENT PRESIDENTIAL CHANGES TOOK PLACE IN LATIN AMERICA COUNTRIES, A PHENOMENON CALLED "NEW COUP". IT ARGUES WHAT CHALLENGES THESE SITUATIONS MAY SHOW TO CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRATIC REGIMES IN SOCIETIES MARKED BY COLONIALITY. THE STUDY COMPARES LATIN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM'S STATE OF THE ART WITH RECENT INSTITUTIONAL DISRUPTIONS THAT INDICATES ANY POSSIBLE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. DEVELOPING A DOCUMENTAL E BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCH, RELATED WITH A DIFFERENT AREA, POLITICAL SCIENCE, WE EXPLORE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN COLONIALISM, COLONIALITY AND LAW, TO PRESENT A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO EMPOWER DEMOCRACY IN MARGINAL SOCIETIES.
620	A RECENT CONSEQUENTIALIST RESURGENCE IN TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP URGES JUDGES IN CASES INVOLVING AUTHORITATIVE TEXTS TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHICH OUTCOMES WILL BE BEST FOR SOCIETY. SOME CONSEQUENTIALIST SCHOLARS ASSERT THAT JUDGES SHOULD OPENLY DISCLOSE THESE REASONS, WHILE OTHERS ADVOCATE REPLACING THEM WITH ANY PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT EMPLOYING THE TRADITIONAL LANGUAGE OF INTERPRETATION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT MAKING CONSEQUENTIALISM THE PRIMARY BASIS FOR JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING RUNS COUNTER TO THE LONG HISTORY OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION, IS CONTRARY TO THE INSIGHTS OF MODERN DECISION SCIENCE, AND RAISES SIGNIFICANT SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUES, EVEN WHEN IT IS FULLY DISCLOSED. COVERT CONSEQUENTIALISM IS EVEN LESS LIKELY TO LEAD TO GOOD CONSEQUENCES, AND IT POSES SUBSTANTIAL THREATS TO BOTH THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
621	A NUMBER OF SCHOLARS HAVE RECENTLY CLAIMED THAT 'STATENESS' IS A PREREQUISITE FOR DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, A LARGE-N EMPIRICAL APPRAISAL OF THIS NEW RESEARCH AGENDA IS STILL PENDING. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT STATENESS - CONCEPTUALIZED USING THE TWIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE MONOPOLY ON THE USE OF FORCE WITHIN A SOVEREIGN TERRITORY AND A BASIC AGREEMENT ABOUT CITIZENSHIP - IS TO A LARGE EXTENT A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE FOUR DEMOCRATIC ATTRIBUTES OF ELECTORAL RIGHTS, POLITICAL LIBERTIES, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SOCIAL RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE ANALYSES ALSO SHOW THAT STATENESS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR THE LATTER TWO ATTRIBUTES WHEREAS THE FORMER TWO ARE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED IN ITS ABSENCE. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST AND THEY FIT WELL INTO THE DOMINANT WRITINGS ON DEMOCRATIZATION, WHICH EMPHASIZE THAT IN THE PRESENT 'LIBERAL HEGEMONY' DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS ARE OFTEN GRAFTED ONTO WEAK STATES - BUT THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE MUCH MORE INTIMATELY WEDDED TO STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS STATENESS.
622	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COURT AND ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) IN THE LEGAL ADMINISTRATION OF CIVIL JUSTICE. IT ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADR AND THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE? HOW DO WE MAKE SENSE OF THE ANTI-ADR VIEWS, IN PARTICULAR THE SERIOUS THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW? WHAT ROLE DOES, AND SHOULD, THE COURT PLAY IN ALTERNATIVE PROCESSES? IT ARGUES THAT INTEGRATING ADR INTO THE COURT SYSTEM BROADENS THE NOTION OF JUSTICE AND ITS ACCESS, AND THAT, UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, JUDGES SHOULD PLAY A MORE CENTRAL ROLE TO ENSURE THE USE, QUALITY AND INTEGRITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROCESSES. THIS PAPER EXTENDS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG JUSTICE, ADR AND THE COURT FROM AN INTERNAL PERSPECTIVE. IT ALSO POINTS OUT THE NEED TO EXPAND THE CASE MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF JUDGES, AND THEIR DELEGATES IN THE ONLINE COURT, ON ADR.
623	THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AND RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESS, BUT EXISTING STUDIES OFTEN TREAT RULE OF LAW HOLISTICALLY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF COURTS, SPECIFICALLY THE SPEED OF COURT DECISIONS, THE ENFORCEMENT OF EDICTS, AND THE IMPARTIALITY OF DECISION-MAKING AS PERCEIVED BY FIRMS OF VARIOUS SIZES, AND THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON FIRM INVESTMENTS IN REAL PROPERTY. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES A PANEL OF 6,300 FIRMS FROM 27 COUNTRIES IN THE PERIOD FROM 2002 TO 2009 TO FIND THAT (I) FIRM SIZE AFFECTS PERCEPTIONS POSITIVELY, WHILE (II) PAYING BRIBES AFFECTS PERCEPTIONS NEGATIVELY. AT THE SAME TIME, (III) A FIRM'S CONNECTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT HAVE NO APPARENT IMPACT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHILE ALL THREE COMPONENTS HAVE A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE AMOUNT FIRMS INVEST IN LAND AND MACHINERY, THE SPEED OF COURTS HAS THE GREATEST SIGNIFICANCE AND THE HIGHEST MARGINAL EFFECT. FIRMS PERCEIVING COURTS TO BE QUICK INVEST NEARLY FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS THE AVERAGE REAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD FOCUS ON REDUCING BACKLOGS IN THE COURT SYSTEM, PERHAPS BY ENCOURAGING MORE ARBITRATION OR STAFFING MORE CLERKS.
624	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXAMINE AND CONSIDER-ALBEIT IN OUTLINE - THE NATURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION TO OBEY VALID LAW. THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN THIS REGARD LIES IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH CITIZENS SHOULD BE COERCED INTO OBEDIENCE TO UNJUST LAWS' FOR EXAMPLE; IF THE LAW IN QUESTION DEPRIVES THEM OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS. THE STUDY THEREFORE, ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ON THE CHOSEN SUBJECT: ARE THERE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT, RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION TO OBEY THE LAW IRRESPECTIVE OF THE QUALITY OF THE LAW? IS THE DUTY ONLY PRIMA FACIE? IS THERE A DUTY TO DISOBEY THE LAW IN PURSUIT OF A HIGHER IDEAL OR IN PURSUIT OF HUMAN RIGHTS? EACH OF THESE VAST AND TIMELESS PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS UNDERPINS THE CONCEPTS OF RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN 21ST CENTURY CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. THE STUDY IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE AND COMPILATION OF OTHER AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON THE RULE OF LAW. LEANING ON PROFESSOR DWORKIN'S THEORY, THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE OF THE STATE TO ACT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IS A DIFFICULT MATTER BECAUSE IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR THE STATE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND TO RESPECT THE OPINION OF THE CITIZENS AND SOCIETY IN GENERAL ESPECIALLY WHERE EVEN THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
625	A COMMONLY HELD ASSUMPTION IN THE TRANSITION LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT EARLIER SUCCESSES WITH REFORMS IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD SERVE AS AN ASSET WHEN THE REGIME CHANGED. TAKING HUNGARY AS A CASE IN POINT, THE AUTHOR REVISITS THE LEGACIES FROM PRE-TRANSITION PERIOD, CALLING FOR DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN SHORT AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE REFORM LEGACY. EMPHASISED IS THAT WESTERN STAKEHOLDERS TENDED TO MISJUDGE THE STARTING POSITION OF TRANSITION NATIONS, GENERALLY. THIS INQUIRY EXPOSES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS OF DEMOCRACY, MARKET ORDER, AND RULE OF LAW IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION, HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL CONFORMITY WITH EU RULES AND THE DIVERGING TENDENCIES IN SOME COUNTRIES CONCERNING SUBSTANCE OF MARKET (E.G. COMPETITION) AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY (CHECKS AND BALANCES, SEPARATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL BRANCHES). THE HUNGARIAN CASE ASSISTS IN EXPLAINING THE EMERGENCE OF SYMPTOMS OF A CRONY STATE, AND THE SEEMINGLY HIGH-LEVEL OF TOLERANCE FOR ORGANISED CORRUPTION AND FAVOURITISM.
626	PURPOSEGIVEN THE URGENCY TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF 12 MACRO-LEVEL ANTECEDENTS ON ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL (E&E) SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM IN 12 DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. FOCUS WAS PLACED ON SHAREHOLDER-INITIATED E&E RESOLUTIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHPANEL REGRESSIONS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MACRO-LEVEL ANTECEDENTS AND TWO DEPENDENT VARIABLES, NAMELY, THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER-INITIATED E&E RESOLUTIONS FILED AND VOTING SUPPORT FOR THESE RESOLUTIONS. FINDINGSTHE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER-INITIATED E&E RESOLUTIONS FILED INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER THE RESEARCH PERIOD (2010-2019) BUT RECEIVED VERY LITTLE VOTING SUPPORT ON AVERAGE. MOST OF THE 1,116 CONSIDERED RESOLUTIONS CENTRED ON THE ADOPTION OR AMENDMENT OF NUCLEAR AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. SEVERAL RESOLUTIONS CALLED FOR IMPROVED E&E REPORTING. A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER-INITIATED E&E RESOLUTIONS FILED AND THE RULE OF LAW. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONSTHE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONFIRMED LIMITED VOTING SUPPORT FOR SHAREHOLDER-INITIATED E&E RESOLUTIONS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ADVANCING THE E&E SOCIAL MOVEMENT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSAS THE E&E SOCIAL MOVEMENT IS GAINING MOMENTUM, LISTED COMPANIES IN THE CONSIDERED COUNTRIES ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE MORE PRESSURE FROM SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONSTO ACHIEVE PARTICIPATORY AND INCLUSIVE CLIMATE GOVERNANCE, SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS SHOULD COLLABORATE MORE CLOSELY WITH OTHER CHALLENGERS IN THE E&E SOCIAL MOVEMENT, NOTABLY POLICY MAKERS AND THOSE PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE AUTHORS CONSIDERED MACRO-LEVEL ANTECEDENTS OF E&E SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISM THAT HAVE RECEIVED SCANT ATTENTION IN EARLIER STUDIES. SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEORY WAS USED AS A NOVEL THEORETICAL LENS.
627	SINCE 1990, NEARLY SEVENTY HEADS OF STATE HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED FOR CRIMES COMMITTED WHILE IN OFFICE. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE, THE PROSECUTIONS HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE LARGELY DUE TO AN EROSION OF THE STATE IMMUNITY PRINCIPLE AND THE EMERGENCE OF SPECIALIZED COURTS WITH A MANDATE TO PROSECUTE POLITICAL FIGURES. INTERESTING QUESTIONS ARISE AS TO WHY THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE SHIFTED AND WHETHER THE TREND TOWARDS GREATER NUMBERS OF PROSECUTIONS HAS ENHANCED THE RULE OF LAW. IN THEIR BOOK, PROSECUTING HEADS OF STATE, EDITORS ELLEN L LUTZ AND CAITLIN REIGER SHED LIGHT ON THESE LARGER QUESTIONS. IN THIS REVIEW, THE AUTHOR EXPLORES LUTZ AND REIGER'S PREMISE THAT THE INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO PROSECUTE HEADS OF STATE HAS BEEN THE DIRECT RESULT OF ACTIVIST LAWYERING, AND QUESTIONS WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW CAN TRULY BE ENHANCED BY PROSECUTIONS THAT ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO POLITICAL MOTIVATIONS. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES BY CAUTIONING AGAINST THE OVER- RELIANCE ON JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CONTEXTS.
628	THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO GROWING RESEARCH ABOUT THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, OR HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY, STILL A SALIENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WESTERN INSTITUTIONALIZED DEMOCRACIES AND THE NEW DEMOCRACIES IN POST-COMMUNIST EURASIA. RECENT RESEARCH HAS THEORIZED SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AS A POSSIBLE MECHANISM LINKING PUBLIC CAMPAIGNING BY CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH THE ACTIVATION OF INSTITUTIONS OF HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY. BY REVIEWING THE RECENT PUBLIC CAMPAIGNS OF VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS IN POST-SOVIET UKRAINE, THIS ARTICLE TURNS THE LENS OF SUCH RESEARCH BY FOCUSING LESS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS MOBILIZING TO BRING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE ON THE STATE ITSELF. IT ARGUES THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY HAVE TO BE JUDGED AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF CONTAINMENT MEASURES THAT STATES ATTEMPT IN ORDER TO DEMOBILIZE PUBLIC OPPOSITION TO THEIR POLICIES. SUCH MEASURES OPERATE THROUGH TWISTED LEGALITY, A SET OF MEASURES POLICING PROTESTS THROUGH MEANS THAT ARE LARGELY LEGAL BUT SPECIFICALLY TARGET PROTESTERS IN WAYS THAT COULD NOT FUNCTION WERE STATE POWERS INDEED SEPARATED (FOR INSTANCE, IF THE POLICE APPARATUS WERE TO OPERATE ON THE BASIS OF LEGAL MANDATES ISSUED BY INDEPENDENT COURTS). FURTHERMORE, THE GOAL OF POLICING ACTIONS IS TO PUSH PROTESTERS OUT OF LEGALITY, IN WAYS THAT I DESCRIBE BELOW.
629	BASED ON MAJOR LANDMARK EVENTS AND THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE-OF-LAW CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA, OVER 40 YEARS SINCE THE INITIATION OF THE REFORM AND OPENING UP POLICY, CAN BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR STAGES: THE "RECOVERY" STAGE; THE "RAPID DEVELOPMENT BY FOCUSING ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEGISLATION" STAGE; THE "IMPLEMENTING THE BASIC POLICY OF LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY AND FOCUSING ON LAW-BASED ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT" STAGE; AND THE "SIMULTANEOUS ADVANCEMENT AND INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION IN BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA" STAGE. OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS, CHINA'S ADMINISTRATIVE RULE-OF-LAW CONSTRUCTION HAS ACHIEVED FRUITFUL RESULTS IN TERMS OF THEORETICAL SHAPING, SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION, AND CONCEPT POPULARIZATION. THE FUTURE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RULE OF LAW SHOULD PROMPTLY RESPOND TO THE THEORETICAL NEEDS PUT FORWARD BY STATE GOVERNANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES, EMERGING SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, AND IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE THEORETICAL SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS; WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN LEGISLATION IN KEY AREAS, SOLVE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTE THE EFFECT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. WE SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE AWARENESS AND QUALITIES OF THE RULE OF LAW AT ALL LEVELS OF LEADING CADRES AND FORM A GOOD RULE OF LAW ATMOSPHERE IN THE ENTIRE SOCIETY.
630	COMPANIES HAVE REACTED TO THE APPARENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF GLOBALIZATION THROUGH VARIOUS GLOBAL PRODUCTION PRACTICES THAT HAVE INCREASED SUPPLY CHAIN COMPLEXITY AND VARIOUS FORMS OF RISK. THROUGH INCREASING SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION, COMPANIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MANAGE THIS INCREASED LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY. SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A KEY PRACTICE TO MANAGE SUPPLY CHAINS AND ACHIEVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE. THE INTENT OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE SUCCESS OF SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION IN TERMS OF THEIR IMPACT ON COST AND INNOVATION PERFORMANCE. BY APPLYING THE RELATIONAL VIEW AND THROUGH CROSS-COUNTRY SURVEY AND SECONDARY COUNTRY DATA WE EXPLORE DIFFERENCES IN SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATION EFFICACY BASED ON THE RISK OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS (MEASURED IN TERMS OF THE STRENGTH OF A COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW) AND THE MITIGATING EFFECT OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. ONE OF THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS SUGGESTS THAT SUPPLIER INTEGRATION IS ALSO EFFECTIVE IN WEAK RULE OF LAW (I.E., HIGH RISK) ENVIRONMENTS. FURTHERMORE, COMPANIES CAN COMPLEMENT AND STRENGTHEN THE PERFORMANCE IMPACT OF THEIR SUPPLIER INTEGRATION PRACTICES THROUGH SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN RISKY ENVIRONMENTS.

631	THIS PAPER POSES THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN ECONOMISTS AND LAWYERS ON JUDICIAL CONTROL IN ECONOMICS IN ORDER TO SHOW THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THIS PROCESS. THE ANALYSIS CONTAINS THREE PARTS: (I) CONTEXTUALIZATION OF THE DEBATE CONSIDERING THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS DOCTRINE; (II) APPROACH THE DEBATE FROM TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 1991 COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTION, WHETHER EMPHASIZING THE CLASSICAL LIBERALISM OR THE "SOCIAL" NATURE OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW CONTAINED IN THE MAGNA CHARTA; (III) FINALLY, SOME OF THE MAIN CRITICS SUBJECTED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMIC ISSUES, AS WELL AS THE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGITIMACY AND DESIRABILITY OF SUCH CONTROL WILL BE ADDRESSED. SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS MADE ON THE OBJECTION THAT JUDICIAL INTERVENTION IN ECONOMY WOULD BE UNDEMOCRATIC; ALSO, THE RESPONSE TO THIS DEMURRAL ARISES IN THE LATTER PART.
632	REPUBLICANISM IS THE DOCTRINE THAT PUBLIC POWER SHOULD ALWAYS SERVE THE COMMON GOOD OF ALL THOSE SUBJECT TO ITS RULE. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION HOW TO DO SO MOST EFFECTIVELY, EITHER THROUGH PARTICULAR POLICIES OR THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ("THE REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT"). THE REPUBLICAN PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION BEGAN WITH PLATO AND ARISTOTLE, FLOWERED IN THE WRITINGS OF MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO, AND REAPPEARED WITH THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN SUCH AUTHORS AS MACHIAVELLI, JAMES HARRINGTON, JOHN ADAMS, AND IMMANUEL KANT. MORE RECENTLY PHILIP PETTIT, JURGEN HABERMAS, AND OTHERS HAVE RETURNED TO THE REPUBLICAN CONCEPTION OF LIBERTY AS NONDOMINATION, AND HOW TO SECURE THIS THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW, POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, AND THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF WELL-DESIGNED DELIBERATIVE POLITICS. REPUBLICANISM SEEKS FREEDOM AND JUSTICE THROUGH LAW AND GOVERNMENT IN PURSUIT OF THE COMMON GOOD.
633	THIS PAPER INITIALLY PRESENTS SOME REFERENCES AROUND THE NOTION OF MORAL PROGRESS, WHICH GENERALLY POINT TO THE IDEA ACCORDING TO WHICH IT DEVELOPS AS A FUNCTION OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN HUMANITY. ALTHOUGH SUCH A STATEMENT ENCOMPASSES A COMMONPLACE, THE PROBLEM MAY BE A MORE SOLID DISCUSSION, RECOGNIZING THAT PROGRESS IS A REFLECTION ACCORDING TO KANT, AND IT CAN ALSO BE A DEDUCTION FROM HISTORY ON THE PART OF FICHTE. THUS, IT SEEKS TO EXPAND THE CONTENT IN THIS REGARD, STATING THAT, ALTHOUGH THESE AUTHORS APPEAL TO MORAL AND THEOLOGICAL SCENARIOS TO EVALUATE THE FUTURE, IN FACT THEIR INTERESTS ARE ON THE ONE HAND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE FICHTEAN CASE AND FOR THE KANTIAN PERSPECTIVE IT WOULD DEAL WITH INSTITUTIONS, WHICH HAPPENS THANKS TO A HUMAN PERFECTIBILITY.
634	AFTER THREE DECADES OF GOVERNMENTS ELECTED BY UNIVERSAL VOTE, ECUADOR SHOWS SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES IN CONSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF DEMOCRACY. ALTHOUGH ECUADOR HOLDS FREE AND TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS, THE DISRESPECT TO DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS, THE WEAK RULE OF LAW, AND STRONG SOCIAL ASYMMETRIES, CHARACTERIZE THE LOW PERFORMANCE OF ITS DEMOCRATIC REGIME. THOUGH PRESIDENT CORREA HAS HAD ALL CONDITIONS TO CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICAL SYSTEM, THE CAUDILLISMO, THE DISRESPECT FOR THE LAW, AND PATRONAGE ARE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF POLITICAL LIFE IN ECUADOR YET.
635	THE ESSAY IS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF HUNGARY IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. IT CAN BE NEATLY DIVIDED INTO THREE PERIODS WHICH COINCIDE WITH THE CALENDAR DECADES ALMOST PERFECTLY. AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM, THE FIRST PERIOD CONSTITUTED A GLORIOUS DECADE IN DEVELOPMENT: THE FIRST TWO GOVERNMENTS IMPLEMENTED ALMOST ALL INDISPENSABLE STRUCTURAL REFORMS REQUIRED FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. AFTER THE FINANCIAL STABILIZATION IN 1995, A CONSISTENT MACROECONOMIC POLICY WAS APPLIED, LEADING TO EXPORT AND INVESTMENT-DRIVEN, HENCE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE NEXT DECADE BROUGHT DETERIORATION: REFORMS WERE STALLED, AND A SHARP TURN TO CONSUMPTION-LED AND DEBT-FUELLED GROWTH RESULTED IN TWIN DEFICITS WHICH, BY THE TIME OF THE GREAT RECESSION, ALMOST TRIGGERED A SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULT. AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL STABILIZATION, A POPULIST-NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWER IN 2010. A DECADE OF DECAY SET IN: REVERSAL OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS, NATIONALIZATION, MONOPOLIZATION, PROTECTIONISM, MARKET-DISTORTING TAXATION AND SUBSIDIZATION, STATE CAPTURE BY A CORRUPT OLIGARCHY, TOGETHER WITH INCONSISTENT MACROECONOMIC POLICY. IN ADDITION, THE SELF-STYLED,ILLIBERAL REGIME" OF VIKTOR ORBAN DEMOLISHED THE RULE OF LAW AND ALL INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING CHECKS AND BALANCES IN A DEMOCRACY. CORRUPTION WAS ELEVATED TO THE LEVEL OF OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT POLICY. WITH THE HELP OF THE HUGE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDIES COMING FROM THE EU, THE REGIME MAINTAINED FINANCIAL EQUILIBRIUM AND ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE TIME OF GLOBAL BOOM BETWEEN 2014-2019. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT PRIVATE INVESTMENTS AND PRODUCTIVITY STAY RATHER LOW IN THE NON-TRADABLE SECTOR OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, REAL CONVERGENCE TO WESTERN EFFICIENCY AND LIVING STANDARDS REMAIN ELUSIVE. TODAY HUNGARY CONSTITUTES A PRIMARY EXAMPLE OF AN ECONOMY PUSHED INTO A TYPICAL MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP BY ITS OLIGARCHIC AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIME. IT ALSO PROVES THAT TRANSITION REFORMS ARE ALL REVERSIBLE; INSTITUTIONS ARE FRAGILE. RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY SEEMS TO BE AN INDISPENSABLE PREREQUISITE FOR CONVERGENCE AND DEVELOPMENT.
636	NOWADAYS, CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVELY DISCUSSED CONCEPTS IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL SCIENCES. SEVERAL RESEARCHERS UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE DEMOCRATISATION PROCESS. THE PRESENT RESEARCH IS INTENDED TO BE AN ANALYSIS THROUGH WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY IN ALBANIA AND IN NORTH MACEDONIA IN THE PAST TWELVE YEARS. THE NEW SOCIO-POLITICAL REALITIES, ASSOCIATED WITH A PROCESS OF CONSOLIDATION AND STRENGTHENING OF DEMOCRACY, HAVE LED TO THE REDRAWING OF SOCIAL STRUCTURES IN THE BALKAN SPACE. COMPETITION AND MUTUAL DISTRUST MARKED THE FIRST TWO DECADES AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, BUT SLOWLY, THESE SOCIETIES MATURED AND THE INJURIES OF THE PAST BEGAN TO HEAL AND THE IDEA OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY STARTED TO BE MORE AND MORE IMPLEMENTED. CIVIL SOCIETY WAS REBORN AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, BUT WAS STILL AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND A PROPER LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK. THE IDEA THAT DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY ARE NOT SIMILAR OR CONNECTED MIGHT SEEM INCORRECT OR STRANGE TO SOME, ESPECIALLY NOWADAYS, WHEN THESE CONCEPTS ARE PERCEIVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY. WE PROPOSE TO TEST TWO DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES IN TERMS OF MEANING AND EXPRESSION. FIRST, THAT INTERNALISATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY NORMS INCREASES THE CHANCES FOR THE CIVIL SOCIETY TO PLAY A ROLE AGAINST AUTOCRATISATION AND SECOND, THAT THE GREATER THE INDEPENDENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY FROM THE GOVERNMENT, THE LESS THE CHANCES FOR THE AUTOCRATISING GOVERNMENTS TO CO-OPT OR CAPTURE THE CIVIL SOCIETY. CONTRIBUTING TO THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETY AND DEMOCRATISATION OR AUTOCRATISATION TENDENCIES, THIS ARTICLE LOOKS TO TACKLE AND ANSWER THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: HOW HAVE THE AUTOCRATISATION TENDENCIES IMPACTED THE CHANCES OF INDEPENDENCE OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE INTERNALISATION OF ITS NORMS IN ALBANIA AND NORTH MACEDONIA, AND HAS CIVIL SOCIETY ACTED AS A CHECK FOR DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING? KEYWORDS: ALBANIA, NORTH MACEDONIA, CIVIL SOCIETY, DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW.
637	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CORRELATES OF DIVERSIFICATION AWAY FROM OIL AND NATURAL GAS DEPENDENCE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY RESOURCE BOOM (AND BUST). IN A SAMPLE OF 40 OIL- AND GAS-DEPENDENT ECONOMIES, THE MAJORITY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT SECTORAL DIVERSIFICATION OF GDP, BUT EXPORTS REMAINED HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN FUEL EXPORTS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT COUNTRIES THAT BEGAN THE BOOM WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF OIL AND GAS DEPENDENCE, POORER COUNTRIES, AND THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER- OR SMALLER-THAN-AVERAGE POPULATIONS WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN DIVERSIFYING THEIR GDP DURING THE COMMODITIES BOOM. GOVERNANCE MATTERS - MORE EFFECTIVE, CAPABLE BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER GDP DIVERSIFICATION AWAY FROM OIL AND GAS - THOUGH THE EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORMLY POSITIVE. FOR ANY GIVEN LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, STRONGER RULE OF LAW IS ASSOCIATED WITH LESS GDP DIVERSIFICATION. EDUCATION APPEARS TO AFFECT GDP AND EXPORT DIVERSIFICATION DIFFERENTIALLY. CONSISTENT WITH ENDOGENOUS GROWTH THEORY, COUNTRIES WITH MORE EDUCATED POPULATIONS SAW GREATER GROWTH IN THEIR NONRESOURCE SECTORS THAN COUNTRIES WITH LESS EDUCATED POPULATIONS, THOUGH EDUCATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EXPORT CONCENTRATION. INTERNAL ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY HAS BEEN LESS A MATTER OF POLICY FORMATION AND IMPLEMENTATION, AND MORE A MATTER OF FACTORS THAT SHAPE THE POLICY-MAKING ENVIRONMENT.
638	DESPITE PALESTINE'S ENDEAVOUR TO SEEK FULL UN MEMBERSHIP AND HEREWITH GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, STRONG TENDENCIES TOWARDS VIOLATING BASIC FAIR TRIAL PRINCIPLES CAN BE OBSERVED ON THE GROUND. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH EXPLORATION OF THE CURRENT RULE OF LAW BUILDING EFFORTS IN THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES BY AN EXEMPLARY ANALYSIS OF THE STATUS OF THE RIGHT TO DEFENCE. THE STUDY EXAMINES THE LEGAL SITUATION OF THE RIGHT TO DEFENCE IN PALESTINE AND HOW THOSE REGULATIONS ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED IN EVERYDAY PRACTICE. CONSIDERING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF ACCESS TO LEGAL DEFENCE AND LEGAL AID ON THE UN AND EU LEVEL, THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF GRANTING COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS TO DEFENCE AS PART OF THE RULE OF LAW BUILDING EFFORTS, AND ALSO UNDERLINES THE NECESSITY OF ITS APPLICATION DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
639	THE SUBJECT. THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES HISTORICAL LEGAL, THEORETICAL-METHODOLOGICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL PROBLEMS OF THE FORMATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE INSTITUTE OF THE HEAD OF STATE. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO SHOW HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONS OF THE HEAD OF STATE CONCRETIZE HIS POWERS. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE USE OF METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, HISTORICAL LEGAL, FORMAL LEGAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHODS, SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTION. THE MAIN SCIENTIFIC RESULTS. THE AUTHORS SUMMARIZE THAT THE HISTORICAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THE KEY ROLE OF THE HEAD OF STATE IN THE MECHANISM OF ENSURING STATE UNITY AND LAW AND ORDER. REALITY TESTIFIES THE FACT THAT THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CREATES SUFFICIENT CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED WORK OF ALL STATE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, IN THE DIRECTION OF ENSURING THE UNITY OF STATE POWER AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND ORDER. THE INDICATED DIRECTIONS ARE IN MANY WAYS IDENTICAL, ORGANICALLY INTERRELATED AND INTERDEPENDENT, SYSTEMATICALLY DEFINE THE MAIN LINES OF ACTIVITY OF THE HEAD OF STATE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL. FIRSTLY, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONTAINS ONLY THE BASIC POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY EXPANDED BY THE LEGISLATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL DECREES. SECONDLY, THE PRESIDENT HAS SO-CALLED "HIDDEN", DISCRETIONARY POWERS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, IMPLICIT IN IT AND STEM FROM THE SENSE OF PRESIDENTIAL FUNCTIONS THAT MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN UNFORESEEN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. THUS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF A STRONG PRESIDENTIAL POWER ALLOWS THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO ENSURE THE UNITY OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER AND THE EXERCISE OF THE POWERS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY OF RUSSIA (PT. 4 OF ART. 78 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION). SUCH PRESIDENTIAL POWER IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ITS DECREES AND ORDERS, THE ADOPTION OF OPERATIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS. CONCLUSIONS. THE AUTHORS NOTED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WORK OF THE HEAD OF STATE IS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT IN THE STATE UNITY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS DEVELOPED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE.
640	ARE COUNTRIES WITH A FREE PRESS LESS CORRUPT THAN COUNTRIES WHERE THE PRESS IS PARTLY OR COMPLETELY UNFREE? OUR EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION FINDS EVIDENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIGHER LEVELS OF PRESS FREEDOM AND LOWER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION WITH OTHER VARIABLES BEING EQUAL. FURTHERMORE, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT WHILE DEMOCRACY DETERS CORRUPTION ONLY IN COUNTRIES THAT ENJOY PRESS FREEDOM, RULE OF LAW REDUCES CORRUPTION WHETHER THE PRESS IS FREE OR UNFREE. PRESS FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ARE COMPLEMENTS RATHER THAN SUBSTITUTES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION.
641	PURPOSE FIT AND MISFIT (F&M) AFFECT THOUGHTS, ACTIONS AND IMPLEMENTATION. BOTH CONCEPTS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE LAW OR IN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION; SO, THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THESE CONCEPTS CAN BE ADDRESSED FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH F&M HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW. TO DETERMINE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM, THE RULE OF LAW, F&M IS COMPARED WITH THE INDEXES OF HAPPINESS AND LIFE SATISFACTION. THE CLAIM THAT F&M CAN BE MORE OBJECTIVELY STATED IN REGULATION THAT MUST BE BASED ON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS TESTED WITH GOOGLE TRENDS. GOOGLE TRENDS GAVE DATA ON THE SEARCHED NOTIONS (REGULATION, PARTICIPATION, ORGANISATION AND MISFIT), FOR WHICH STATISTICAL CALCULATIONS ARE MADE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM. FINDINGS F&M ARE AN INTANGIBLE CAPITAL WITH WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS TIGHTLY CONNECTED. CITIZENS ARE HAPPY AND SATISFIED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HIGH RANK ON THE RULE OF LAW AND VICE VERSA. CORRELATIONS ARE POSITIVE FOR THE MISFIT AND REGULATION, PARTICIPATION AND ORGANISATION, REGULATION AND ORGANISATION AND REGULATION AND PARTICIPATION, WHILE THOSE FOR MISFIT AND ORGANISATION ARE LOW. GOOGLE SEARCH THEREFORE DENIES THE STRONGEST CONNECTION BETWEEN MISFIT AND ORGANISATION THAT IS IN THE CENTRE OF F&M LITERATURE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE F&M HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A LOT OF SIMILARITY IF NOT THE SAME. BASED ON THIS PREDISPOSITION, THIS PAPER REFUTES SOME ROMANTIC IDEAS ABOUT PERSON-ENVIRONMENT AND PERSON-ORGANISATION FIT, AND IT GIVES OPPOSITE ARGUMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC LAW POINT OF VIEW. THE PAPER TRIES TO POINT TO OPTIMAL SPECIFICITY FOR FIT IN A LEGAL ENVIRONMENT BASED ON PROPOSED INDICATORS AND GIVES DIRECTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.
642	IN THE SEARCH FOR OPTIMAL WAYS OF IMPROVING THE NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONAL-LEGAL FORMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, THE PROBLEM OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT OF RELEVANT PROCESSES IS ACTUALIZED. THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS INHERENTLY LINKED TO ALL PUBLIC-POWER STRUCTURES OF THE MECHANISM OF STATE POWER AND IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF OPTIMAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS, DEMOCRATIC, SOCIAL, RULE OF LAW. IN UKRAINE, IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNIZATION, THE PROBLEM OF IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATIONAL-LEGAL MECHANISM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION REMAINS URGENT. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE INSTITUTE OF THE OMBUDSMAN OPERATES IN UKRAINE. ITS IMPLEMENTATION FULLY MEETS THE TENDENCIES EXISTING IN THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC WORLD AND IS A REACTION TO THOSE CONFLICTS AND CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. NEVERTHELESS, THE SOCIAL INSECURITY OF CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE POPULATION (CHILDREN, PENSIONERS, PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SERVICEMEN, MIGRANTS, INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS, ETHNIC MINORITIES, PERSONS BELONGING TO THE LGBTI COMMUNITY, ENTREPRENEURS, PATIENTS AND OTHER CATEGORIES OF CITIZENS) IS AN INDICATOR OF THE RELEVANCE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE FUNCTIONING OF NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION MECHANISMS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RELEVANT OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS OF THE OMBUDSMAN. THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE PROBLEMS OF RECEPTION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OF THE BASIC MODELS OF ORGANIZATION OF THE OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTE IN THE MECHANISM OF FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE OBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT DELVE INTO THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION PROCESS AND THE OMBUDSMAN'S EXCLUSIVITY IN THE RELEVANT PROCESSES. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY ARE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC METHODS, SUCH AS DIALECTICAL, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, FORMAL-LEGAL, HISTORICAL, AND LOGICAL METHODS OF COGNITION, AS WELL AS SPECIAL AND PRIVATE-LAW METHODS. THE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT, THE CAUSES, THE PROCESSES OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES IN THE MODERN WORLD, THE PERMANENT TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AND THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THEIR SPECIALIZATION ARE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CLASSICAL SYSTEM OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM OF ITS ORGANIZATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE FUNCTIONAL ISOLATION, INDEPENDENCE, AND ORGANIZATIONAL DIVERSITY OF THE CONTROL BODIES, FIRST OF ALL, THE OMBUDSMEN, IS A TESTAMENT TO THE FORMATION OF CONTROL POWER, THE CONCEPTUAL IDEA OF WHICH IS THE EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM OF MEASURES TO ENSURE CONTROL OVER PUBLIC AUTHORITY.
643	WHEREAS THE CONCEPT OF "SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW" PUNCTUATED POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THE LATE 1990S, IT IS THE IDEA OF A "SOCIALIST HARMONIOUS SOCIETY" THAT TODAY CASTS A STRANGE LIGHT, CLEARLY MORE MARXIST THAN CONFUCIAN, ON CHINESE LEGAL REFORM. THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK TURNS LAW INTO A DISCIPLINARY PRINCIPLE DEDICATED TO SOCIETY'S MORAL CONSTRUCTION. IF LAW IS SEEN AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR LEGITIMIZING POWER, IT REMAINS IMPLICITLY BUT PRIMARILY SUBORDINATE TO THE REGIME'S DURABILITY. ALTHOUGH MORE AND MORE ORDINARY CITIZENS ARE SEIZING HOLD OF NORMATIVE TOOLS BEING PUT AT THEIR DISPOSAL, THE PARTY-STATE, FEARFUL OF BEING OUTFLANKED, IS SEEKING TO SNUFF OUT THE DEMOCRATIC FERMENT CONTAINED IN FORCES IT HAS ITSELF UNLEASHED.
644	THIS ARTICLE DELINEATES SOME OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT ARE DEBATED BY PHILOSOPHERS OF LAW. IT EXPLORES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND OTHER AREAS OF PHILOSOPHY, WHILE ALSO SEEKING TO SPECIFY THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE PREOCCUPIED PHILOSOPHERS OF LAW. IT ILLUSTRATES ITS ABSTRACT POINTS WITH EXAMPLES FOCUSED ON THE SEPARABILITY OF LAW AND MORALITY, THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE NATURE OF RIGHTS, JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE IMPOSITION OF PUNISHMENT, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF BASIC LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS.
645	THIS PAPER FIRST HYPOTHESIZES THAT COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED MORE STATEHOOD EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST TWO MILLENNIA TEND TO HAVE MORE STRINGENT CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. A SECOND HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO INDIRECT EFFECTS VIA THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, CORRUPTION, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. OUR EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THESE HYPOTHESES. AN EARLY START HELPS BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. THE STRONGEST INDIRECT EFFECTS OCCUR THROUGH GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION. CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY ANALYSIS MAY TAKE THESE FINDINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND INCORPORATE STATE CAPACITY BUILDING AND BUREAUCRATIC AND LEGAL REFORMS INTO THE DESIGN OF INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS ARE UNLIKELY TO ARRIVE QUICKLY. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
646	THE INHERENT STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS CAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW TO BE WRITTEN IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND HAVE LED TO THE CREATION OF NOVEL ADJUDICATIVE INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS SPECIALIST ENVIRONMENT COURTS AND TRIBUNALS. BUT THEY ALSO FORCE US TO VIEW CORE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. BY PLACING GREATER WEIGHT ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THESE PRINCIPLES AND LESSENING THE FORCE OF OTHERS, SOLVING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS THROUGH LAW IS REBALANCING LEGAL THOUGHT. USING NEW ZEALAND AS A CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT RESPOND TO THIS CONTEXTUAL FORCE BY ENSURING DECISION-MAKING INSTITUTIONS OPERATE WITH INTEGRITY AND REFLECT PUBLIC REASONED THOUGHTFULNESS, SO FOSTERING THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THIS UNUSUAL LEGAL LANDSCAPE.
647	THE PAPER PRESENTS THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE ARGUMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA, THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, AND HUNGARY WHEN DECIDING ON PROCEDURAL/FORMAL ASPECTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEROGATION AND OTHER (RESTRICTIVE) MEASURES ADOPTED DUE TO COVID-19, SUCH AS THE COMPETENCE OF BODIES ORDERING RESTRICTIVE MEASURES, CHARACTER/QUALITY OF THEIR ACTS, CONTROL BY THE LEGISLATURE AND/OR THE EXECUTIVE. THE COMMONALITY IS THAT, DESPITE THE COURTS NOT NEGLECTING THE NEED FOR RESTRICTIVE MEASURES AND THE GENERAL INTEREST IN PRESERVING PUBLIC HEALTH, THEY TREATED THE IMPORTANCE OF FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW DIFFERENTLY IN PANDEMIC CONDITIONS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT COMMON CRITERIA AND TESTS FOR ASSESSING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THESE MEASURES, IN ORDER TO INCREASE LEGAL CERTAINTY IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE, CAUSED BY NEW EPIDEMICS.
648	THIS ESSAY ANSWERS THE QUESTION ABOUT THE NATURE AND THE CONCEPT OF CORRUPTION AND TRIES TO JUSTIFY THE ETHICAL AND JURIDICAL FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN IT: THE DEMOCRATIC STATE, THE RULE OF LAW AND, SPECIFICALLY, THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE PUBLIC OFFICERS. REGARDING THE LATTER, THIS ESSAY ANALYSES SOME PRINCIPLES SUCH AS PUBLIC ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND OFFICIAL PUBLICITY OR TRANSPARENCY.
649	THERE IS A NORMATIVE AND A FUNCTIONAL DIMENSION TO DELEGATION TO NON-MAJORITARIAN INSTITUTIONS. THESE DIMENSIONS ARE EXPLORED IN THIS PAPER AND CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RECENT MODERNIZATION OF EUROPEAN COMMUNITY (EC) COMPETITION LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE PRINCIPAL - AGENT MODEL PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW AND WHY MEMBER STATES DELEGATE EXTENSIVE ENFORCEMENT POWERS TO THE EC COMMISSION AND THE NATIONAL COMPETITION AUTHORITIES, BUT AS IT OFFERS PRIMARILY A FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS THE NORMATIVE ISSUES OF CONTROL, ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGITIMACY CANNOT BE FULLY ENCAPSULATED WITHIN IT. THUS, AN ANALYSIS OF THE EC COMPETITION LAW REGIME REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF BOTH DIMENSIONS USING THE TWIN-TRACK APPROACH OF PRINCIPAL - AGENT ANALYSIS AND A RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW PUBLIC POWER IS AND SHOULD BE EXERCISED WITHIN IT. COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN POLITICS (2009) 7, 414-434. DOI:10.1057/CEP.2008.44
650	THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION OF THIS STUDY IS ABOUT THE DRIVERS OF DEMOCRACY BACKSLIDING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY JUST BEFORE THE SHOCK. THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, DEBATING MOSTLY THE MISUSE OF EMERGENCIES AND VIOLATIONS OF VARIOUS NORMS BY GOVERNMENTS; HOWEVER THE LINKS BETWEEN THE CURRENT DEMOCRACY EROSION WITH INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT REMAIN UNCLEAR. WE USE A NOVEL GLOBAL DATASET COVERING THE PERIOD OF THE FIRST TWO WAVES OF THE PANDEMIC (JANUARY-DECEMBER 2020), AND APPLY VARIOUS ECONOMETRIC AND MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS TO IDENTIFY INSTITUTIONAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FACTORS INFLUENCING DEMOCRACY. OUR RESULTS ARE OF SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE AND IMPLY THAT THE STRONGER THE RULE OF LAW AND THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY, THE LOWER THE RISK OF DEMOCRACY BACKSLIDING IN THE FACE OF THE PANDEMIC.
651	THE TOPIC OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE HAS GAINED MOMENTUM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN EUROPE, WHERE SOME ONGOING INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS ARE THREATENING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. IN THIS SCENARIO, THE STANDARDS PROVIDED BY THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) COULD BE HIGHLY RELEVANT. THE PRESENT ARTICLE EXPLORES THE SETTLED CASE LAW OF THE ECTHR CONCERNING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE NEED TO TACKLE WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION IN A MEMBER STATE MAY JUSTIFY THE ADOPTION OF EXCEPTIONAL MEASURES RESTRICTING OR DEROGATING THE ORDINARY GUARANTEES APPLICABLE TO THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. SPECIAL REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE INTERPRETATION OF ART. 6(1) ECHR IN THE RECENT JUDGMENT XHOXHAJ V. ALBANIA, WHERE THE ECTHR ADDRESSED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE COMPLIANCE OF THE 'VETTING PROCESS', CURRENTLY ONGOING IN ALBANIA, WITH THE ECHR.
652	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE POWERS OF THE JUDICIARY, THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITH REGARD TO ISSUES INVOLVING THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS. IT EXAMINES THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ADOPTED BY JUDGES AND JUDICIARIES IN DIFFERENT COMMON LAW JURISDICTIONS IN HANDLING LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTS THAT TOUCH UPON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, MORAL ISSUES, AND ACTS OF STATE, AND POINTS OUT THAT THE DEMARCATION OF POWERS AMONG THE THREE BRANCHES INVOLVES THE BALANCING OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS WHICH WILL CHANGE WITH TIME. BESIDES, IT ALSO CONCLUDES THAT WHILE THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND CULTURE OF A JURISDICTION ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS DETERMINING THE ROLE OF ITS JUDICIARY AND THE LIMIT OF JUDICIAL POWER OVER EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE ACTS/DECISIONS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASING CONSENSUS ON THE BOUNDARY OF JUDICIAL POWER ACROSS JURISDICTIONS SUBSCRIBING TO THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
653	BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE RULE OF LAW (RECHTSSTAAT) OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THERE IS A PARADIGMATIC LEAP, CHARACTERIZED BY THE TRANSITION FROM A SYSTEMIC AND FUNCTIONALISTIC LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS (INSTRUMENTAL TO THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ORDER) TO A "PERSONALISTIC" ONE. IN THIS SENSE, THE VERY NOTION OF PERSON IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE RECEIVES A NEW SHAPE, CHARACTERIZED BY THE UNAVAILABLE VALUE OF THE PERSON-IN-RELATION: IT CONSTITUTES AN INCLUSIVE NOTION, ALWAYS OPENED TO SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS, THROUGH MUTUAL RECOGNITION BETWEEN SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS. SUCH A RECOGNITION REVEALS ITSELF AS BASED ON THE THOUGHTFUL PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED TO ALL, BUT AT THE SAME TIME BALANCED BY JURISPRUDENCE, IN THE CASE OF THE ONSET OF CONFLICTS, THROUGH THE PRINCIPLES OF PROPORTIONALITY AND REASONABLENESS THAT HAVE ALWAYS CHARACTERIZED JURIDICAL MEDIATIONS.
654	THIS WORK DEALS WITH ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS REGARDING THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ALSO CASTS LIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO ITS EVOLUTION THAT TRANSFORMS IT INTO A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. IT IS FROM HERE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE IS LINKED WITH THE CURRENT THEORIES OF LEGAL REASONING, THERE EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LATTER IN THEN PROCESSES OF CREATION AND INTERPRETATION OF LAW. WITHOUT ANY DESPISE AS TO THE RELEVANCE OF THE JURISDICTIONAL ROLE OF JUDGES, THAT CONFER ARGUMENTATIVE SIGNIFICANCE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IT IS TO BE STRESSED OUT THE EMPOWERMENT VESTED IN LEGISLATORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR REASONING AROUND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEPTS OF THE CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONAL STATE.
655	ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, NINETEEN ISLAMIC TERRORISTS HIJACKED FOUR COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, CRASHING THREE OF THEM INTO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON. FIFTEEN OF THE HIJACKERS WERE FROM SAUDI ARABIA, THE REST FROM THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, EGYPT, AND LEBANON. THE ENSUING WAR ON TERRORISM NOT ONLY DEPOSED REGIMES IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTED POLICIES THAT DEPRIVED "DETAINEES" OF THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS ARTICLE QUESTIONS THE ETHICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY OF SUCH DECISIONS.
656	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEFINE A CERTAIN SET OF PRIORITY AREAS IN NEED OF STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT-ORIENTED INTERVENTION IN CONTEXTS THAT ARE LINKED TO FAILED, FAILING, AND WEEK STATES, INCLUDING POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. THE NEED FOR PRIORITIZATION IS DICTATED, AMONG OTHERS, BY THE SCARCITY OF RESOURCES AND AN OVERALL UNENTHUSIASTIC CLIMATE FOR INTERNATIONAL AID AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. THE VERY CHOICE OF THE AREAS CAN IN ITSELF BE CONCEIVED AS A PRIORITIZATION. THESE FOUR PRIORITY AREAS, OPERATIONALIZED IN THE ARTICLE, FORM THE CORE OF THE ARGUMENT, NAMELY (1) EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS; (2) ENFORCEABLE UNIVERSALISTIC HUMAN RIGHTS/RULE OF LAW; (3) ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; AND (4) EFFECTUATION OF SUPRANATIONAL EFFORTS AND POLICIES IN LINE WITH CONTEXTUAL DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES.
657	IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL SECURITY THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND ITS JUDGES HAVE GUARANTEED INDEPENDENCE ENHANCED BY NORMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER. INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND ITS JUDGES IS IMPLIED FIRST OF ALL IN RELATION NOT ONLY TO OTHER STATE AUTHORITIES (LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL) BUT TO ALL OTHER EXTERNAL INFLUENCES AND POSSIBLE PRESSURES DERIVING FROM ANY CENTRE OF POWER, INTEREST GROUPS I.E. INDIVIDUALS. THE CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED INDEPENDENT AND NEUTRAL POSITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND ITS JUDGES IS ESSENTIAL AND IMPORTANT BUT DEARLY NOT SUFFICIENT. FAVOURABLE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC-SOCIAL CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR ITS REALIZATION IN REAL SOCIAL RELATIONS BUT MOSTLY DEVELOPED SOCIAL AWARENESS OF THE ROLE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ACTIVITIES IN SECURING CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY, RULE OF LAW, LEGAL SECURITY AS CONSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL PRESUMPTIONS TO DEVELOPING DEMOCRATIC ENVIRONMENT, SOCIETY, TOLERANCE, DIALOGUE AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION.
658	BURMESE COLONIAL HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT A LEGAL SYSTEM CANNOT OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE FELT NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO OBEY THE LAW. DESPITE A MONOPOLY OF FORCE FOR MANY DECADES, THE BRITISH FAILED TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE LEGAL SYSTEM IN BURMA. COLONIAL STATUS SHIFTED BURMA'S ECONOMIC ROLE FROM SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE TO THE GENERATION OF LARGE-SCALE EXPORTS. BY UNDERMINING THE TRADITIONAL BURMESE LEGAL SYSTEM AND SUBSTITUTING WESTERN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS, AND AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY-ALL ATTRIBUTES OF WHAT SOME CONSIDER TO BE THE "RULE OF LAW"- THE LEGAL SYSTEM AMPLIFIED AND CHANNELLED DESTRUCTIVE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL FORCES RATHER THAN CONTAINING THEM. THIS PAPER EXAMINES TRADITIONAL BURMESE LAW, THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW IN BRITISH BURMA, AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE NEW LEGAL SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTRY AND ITS OWN STABILITY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING LESSONS FOR MYANMAR TODAY, AND FOR THE STUDY OF THE "RULE OF LAW."
659	THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL OFFICIALS' RESPECT FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. IT MODELS THE POLICING OF RIGHTS AS A COORDINATION PROBLEM AMONG CITIZENS, BUT ONE WITH ASYMMETRIES DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE IN A DECENTRALIZED MANNER. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT DEMOCRATIC STABILITY DEPENDS ON A SELF-ENFORCING EQUILIBRIUM: IT MUST BE IN THE INTERESTS OF POLITICAL OFFICIALS TO RESPECT DEMOCRACY'S LIMITS ON THEIR BEHAVIOR. THE CONCEPT OF SELF-ENFORCING LIMITS ON THE STATE ILLUMINATES A DIVERSE SET OF PROBLEMS AND THUS SERVES AS A POTENTIAL BASIS FOR INTEGRATING THE LITERATURE. THE FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO A RANGE OF TOPICS, SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC STABILITY, PLURAL SOCIETIES, AND ELITE PACTS. THE PAPER ALSO APPLIES ITS LESSONS TO THE CASE OF THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION IN SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLAND.
660	IN ANY EVENT THE PARABLES SOMETIMES DRAWN FROM THE STUART PERIOD BY SOME TWENTIETH CENTURY JUDGES - 'HER MAJESTY'S JUDGES' (A NICE TERM), AS WE CALL THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE DISPUTE-DECIDING DEPARTMENT - TO SUPPORT DECISIONS AGAINST THE 'EXECUTIVE' (A NASTY TERM) ARE TO ME THEOLOGY IN ITS PUREST FORM.(1) IS SOMEBODY BEING ACTUALLY HURT BY SOME ACTUAL DEFECT IN THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND, IF SO, WHAT IS THAT DEFECT AND HOW CAN IT BE REMEDIED: THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE ASKED.
661	THE BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER A. V. DICEY ARGUED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT THE COMMON LAW, AS ADMINISTERED BY SUPERIOR COURTS, BETTER ENSURED GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY THAN DID WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS. DICEY TAUGHT US TO FOCUS LESS ON CONSTITUTIONAL PROMISES AND MORE ON THE PRACTICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIAL REMEDIES. THIS ARTICLE BUILDS ON DICEY BY OFFERING A COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF MILITARY ENCROACHMENTS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE NATION'S CITIZENS DURING TIMES OF WAR. RATHER THAN COMPARING BRITISH COMMON-LAW NORMS TO EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONALISM, AS DICEY DID, THIS ARTICLE COMPARES NINETEENTH-CENTURY COMMON LAW AS APPLIED IN THE COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CONSTITUTIONALLY-INFLECTED RULES THAT THOSE COURTS APPLY TODAY. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ITS COMPARISON ON THREE COMMON-LAW REMEDIES: HABEAS TO SECURE RELEASE FROM MILITARY DETENTION; TRESPASS TO OBTAIN AN AWARD OF DAMAGES FOR WRONGFUL OR ABUSIVE MILITARY CONFINEMENT; AND TORT AND CONTRACT-BASED COMPENSATION FOR THE MILITARY'S DESTRUCTION OR TAKING OF PROPERTY. THE MODERN SUPREME COURT HAS RECALIBRATED EACH OF THESE COMMON-LAW REGIMES AND NOW EVALUATES THE LEGALITY OF THE MILITARY'S ACTIONS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN CONSTITUTIONAL TERMS. AS DICEY MIGHT HAVE PREDICTED, THE SHIFT AWAY FROM HARD-EDGED COMMON-LAW RULES TO OPEN-ENDED CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCING CORRESPONDS TO A MARKED LOSS OF RELATIVE REMEDIAL EFFECTIVENESS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT HAVE SHAPED THE REMEDIAL DECLINE, AS REFLECTED IN HAMDI V. RUMSFELD AND ZIGLAR V. ABBASI. IT THEN OFFERS SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW THE COURT MIGHT KEEP THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT IN BETTER REPAIR.
662	PRISON EXPANSIONISM AROUND THE WORLD IS, IN PART, FACILITATED BY EXTOLLING THE PRISON AS A SYMBOL OF 'WESTERN-DEMOCRACY' WHICH IS JUSTIFIED AS AN EFFECTIVE AND TRANSPARENT MEANS OF ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW AND AS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED INDICATOR OF A STRONG STATE. THIS ARTICLE, HOWEVER, ARGUES THAT THE REALITIES OF PRISONS DO NOT MATCH UP WITH THEIR SYMBOLIC AND EXTOLLED VIRTUES. DRAWING ON EXISTING EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL LITERATURE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE ROLE OF THE PRISON AS A SYMBOL OF EFFECTIVE 'STATE-BUILDING' IGNORES THE IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE OF THE 'FIASCO' OF THE PRISON, EITHER TO FULFIL ITS OWN STATED PURPOSES OR TO OPERATE IN WAYS THAT ADHERE TO OR STRENGTHEN DEMOCRATIC IDEALS. FURTHER, IT SUGGESTS THAT INTERNATIONAL BODIES, NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS, STATE OFFICIALS AND SCHOLARS MUST ENGAGE MORE HONESTLY WITH THE 'TRUTH ABOUT PRISONS' AND THEIR FAILURE TO FUNCTION IN THE WAYS THEY ARE IMAGINED TO.
663	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND DOMESTIC ACTORS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL QUALITY (RULE OF LAW) ACROSS TWO KEY DIMENSIONS: JUDICIAL CAPACITY AND JUDICIAL IMPARTIALITY. IT ARGUES AND SHOWS EMPIRICALLY THAT ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS BEEN CRUCIAL IN ELICITING CHANGE IN THE JUDICIAL CAPACITY DIMENSION, IT WAS LARGELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHANGING ASPECTS OF THE JUDICIAL IMPARTIALITY DIMENSION. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE EU'S INVOLVEMENT IN ROMANIA THROUGH ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY HAS BEEN OF LIMITED SUCCESS: THAT IS, THE EU HAD A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON IMPROVING DE JURE JUDICIAL QUALITY, BUT IT WAS UNABLE TO AFFECT RULE IMPLEMENTATION AND THUS FAILED TO CREATE DE FACTO JUDICIAL QUALITY. METHODOLOGICALLY, THIS ARTICLE MAKES USE OF A DETAILED CASE-STUDY METHOD WITH PROCES-STRACING. DATA ARE DRAWN FROM A NUMBER OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES SUCH AS OFFICIAL GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS, REPORTS, SURVEYS AND SCHOLARLY LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC.
664	THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF CORRUPTION, NATIONAL CULTURE, AND RULE OF LAW ON THE DIVIDEND REPATRIATION POLICY OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF US MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (MNCS) IN 51 COUNTRIES. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF US MNCS REPATRIATE LOWER DIVIDENDS FROM HOST COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A HIGHER RATE OF CORRUPTION. ADDITIONALLY, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF US MNCS REPATRIATE HIGHER DIVIDENDS FROM INDIVIDUALISTIC COUNTRIES. FURTHER, WEAK LEGAL PROTECTION IN THE HOST COUNTRY LEADS TO HIGHER DIVIDEND REPATRIATION. MOREOVER, GIVEN AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEM IN A HOST COUNTRY, FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF US MNCS WITH HIGHER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES REPATRIATE LOWER DIVIDENDS. FINALLY, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF US MNCS FUNCTIONING IN COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER RATE OF CORRUPTION, INDIVIDUALISTIC CULTURE, AND THE STRICT RULE OF LAW ADJUST FASTER TOWARDS OPTIMAL DIVIDEND REPATRIATION POLICY. THE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATION METHODS AND MEASURES. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
665	THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH A VARIETY OF TOOLS FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN WEAK STATES, YET WITH FEW SUCCESSES. AN INNOVATIVE TOOL IS HYBRID COMMISSIONS NOT SUPPLANTING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM OF THE TARGET STATE BUT FIGHTING IMPUNITY FROM WITHIN IT. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION I THEREFORE SEEK TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS THAT RENDER THIS NOVEL MECHANISM OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION EFFECTIVE, ARGUING THAT A SET OF FACTORS - SUPPORT FROM THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, CIVIL SOCIETY AND POWERFUL DONORS; AS WELL AS THE COMMISSION'S INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, ITS STRATEGY, AND THE PERSONALITY OF THE COMMISSIONER - WILL DETERMINE IF THE CHANGES INITIATED BY THE HYBRID LEAD TO A DEEPER TRANSFORMATION OF THE HOST STATE, OR IF THERE WILL BE A RULE OF LAW ROLLBACK AS SOON AS THE COMMISSION LEAVES THE COUNTRY.
666	IT HAS BECOME A POPULAR VIEW IN JURISPRUDENCE THAT THE LAW EXISTS TO GUIDE US. I ARGUE IN THIS ARTICLE THAT IT IS PLAUSIBLE TO THINK THAT THE LAW DOES NOT NECESSARILY EXIST TO GUIDE US. I DO THIS WHILE ACCEPTING THAT THE LAW IS NECESSARILY NORMATIVE. THE UPSHOT OF THE ARGUMENT IS SIGNIFICANT. VIEWING AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AS A NECESSARY FEATURE OF THE LAW GIVES RISE TO A DISTINCTIVE MODE OF OPERATING THAT SOME THINK HAS INHERENTLY VALUABLE QUALITIES. WE GET TO SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDES SOME NECESSARY CONSTRAINTS ON HOW LAWS SHOULD BE DESIGNED. THESE VALUABLE AIMS AND CONSTRAINTS BECOME EXTERNAL AIMS AND CONSTRAINTS ONCE GUIDANCE IS JETTISONED FROM THE CONCEPT OF LAW. IT WOULD NOT, FOR EXAMPLE, BE TRUE JUST IN VIRTUE OF THE VERY NATURE OF LAW THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE SECRET OR OPPRESS PEOPLE INTO CONFORMITY.
667	THE EMERGENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW OFFERS A NEW SCENARIO REGARDING THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION. IN THIS SENSE, THE JUDGE, FAR FROM LIMITING ITSELF TO MECHANICALLY APPLYING THE RULES, IS ACTIVE AND HAS BROAD NORMATIVE POWERS. THIS CHARACTERIZATION ENCOURAGES US TO SERIOUSLY THINK ABOUT TWO PROBLEMS IN PARTICULAR: ON ONE HAND, WIDE JUDICIAL FREEDOM CAN BECOME A RISK FOR THE INSTITUTIONALITY OF LAW AND THE POWER DIVISION SCHEME; ON THE OTHER, IT CAN VIOLATE THE CITIZENS' CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES.THIS PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS THOSE TWO PROBLEMS. IT WILL SEEK TO ARGUE IN FAVOR OF THE THESIS THAT PROACTIVE JUDICIAL PRACTICES WOULD FALL PRIMA FACIE INTO JUSTIFIED ACTIVISM AS LONG AS CERTAIN LIMITS ARE RESPECTED (PROCEDURAL AND RELATED TO THE STATE ORGANIZATION) AND THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS, THE DEFENSE OF THE COLLECTIVE GOOD OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE REALIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.
668	TURKEY'S LEGAL SYSTEM WAS REFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE LAST DECADE, WITH THE AVOWED OBJECTIVE OF ALIGNING IT WITH EUROPEAN NORMS AND FACILITATING THE COUNTRY'S ACCESSION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION. ON PAPER, TURKEY NOW HAS A LEGAL REGIME THAT IS LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM EUROPE'S IN TERMS OF PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS AND THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS. BUT THE REALITY ON THE GROUND COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE ERGENEKON AND SLEDGEHAMMER TRIALS HAVE BEEN MARRED BY SEVERE VIOLATIONS OF DUE PROCESS AND THE USE OF HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC EVIDENCE AGAINST DEFENDANTS. PRO-GOVERNMENT MEDIA HAVE MANIPULATED THE DEBATE IN THE COUNTRY AND PROSECUTORS HAVE ACTED IN WAYS THAT ARE SHARPLY AT VARIANCE WITH EUROPEAN LEGAL NORMS. THESE CASES WILL, HE ARGUES, DISCREDIT THE TURKISH JUDICIARY AND SET BACK THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF TURKISH POLITICS.
669	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS HISTORICALLY SITUATE THE MEANING OF THE WORD "TOLERANCE" IN WESTERN CULTURE. THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW HOW REPRESENTATIVE TENDENCIES OF MODERN SOCIAL THOUGHT DOES NOT CONSIDER VIABLE LEGAL EMBODIMENT OF THIS POLITICAL VIRTUE IN PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACIES. STILL WANT THE ITEM, DISAGREEING WITH THESE CURRENTS, WHICH WOULD INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS OF THE NEW TOLERANCE, CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PRINCIPLE FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
670	THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES WHETHER THE NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT 2007 (CTH) CAN EFFECTIVELY ACCOMMODATE PUBLIC HEALTH AND NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY OBJECTIVES UNDER ONE ACT TO MEET THE BIOSECURITY CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY. THE FORMATION OF THE ACT, ITS SUBSTANTIVE PARTS, AND ITS SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS ARE DESCRIBED BEFORE THE ACT IS ASSESSED UNDER THE RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS PROPOSED BY PROFESSOR DAVID FIDLER AND PROFESSOR LAWRENCE GOSTIN. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT WHEREAS THE PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVE OF THE ACT WAS TO SIMPLIFY THE REPORTING PROCESS SURROUNDING PUBLIC HEALTH INCIDENTS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS, THE AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE ACT IN RESPONSE TO NATIONAL SECURITY NEEDS HAVE HAD THE CONTRARY EFFECT OF COMPLICATING PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTING WITH MARGINAL GAINS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCURRENT PURSUIT OF NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY AND PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY IS FRAUGHT WITH DIFFICULTY AND SUGGESTS THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE REVIEWED.
671	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS HISTORICALLY SITUATE THE MEANING OF THE WORD "TOLERANCE" IN WESTERN CULTURE. THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHOW HOW REPRESENTATIVE TENDENCIES OF MODERN SOCIAL THOUGHT DOES NOT CONSIDER VIABLE LEGAL EMBODIMENT OF THIS POLITICAL VIRTUE IN PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACIES. STILL WANT THE ITEM, DISAGREEING WITH THESE CURRENTS, WHICH WOULD INVESTIGATE THE CONCEPTUAL BASIS OF THE NEW TOLERANCE, CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL PRINCIPLE FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW.
672	THIS CONTRIBUTION OUTLINES THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHICH STARTED IN HUNGARY. IT ARGUES THAT THE CRISIS OF VALUES IS THE FIRST SYSTEMIC CHALLENGE TO THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE PROJECT. THE KEY FEATURES OF THE CRISIS ARE ANALYZED AS WELL AS THE REASONS THAT LED TO THE CRISIS, FOCUSING NOT ONLY ON THE EU'S POWERLESSNESS TO RESOLVE IT IN TERMS OF PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT, BUT ALSO ON THE JUSTICE VOID, WHICH LOOMS BEYOND THE INTERNAL MARKET, MAKING EU'S SUBSTANTIVE INVOLVEMENT - INDISPENSABLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CRISIS - OVERWHELMINGLY DIFFICULT. THE MAIN POINT IS VERY SIMPLE: THE CRISIS OF VALUES IS SOMETHING NEW AND ITS IMPORTANCE SHOULD BE REALIZED IN FULL, AS IT CORRUPTS THE CORE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE EU INDISPENSABLE FOR EUROPE'S SUCCESSFUL FUNCTIONING.
673	THE NATIONAL AUDIT IS PRODUCED AND DEVELOPED TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE, AND IS A BASIC INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT WITHIN THE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF ITS INSTITUTIONAL ATTRIBUTES, LEGAL STATUS AND FUNCTIONS, THE NATIONAL AUDIT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND AN IMPORTANT GUARANTEE DRIVING THE MODERNIZATION OF GOVERNANCE. IN THIS NEW HISTORICAL ERA, THE NATIONAL AUDIT NEEDS TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THE NEW SITUATION AND NEW REQUIREMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVELY DEEPENING REFORM AND ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW. WE MUST ACCELERATE THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE AUDIT SYSTEM, ENHANCE THE BREADTH OF COVERAGE OF AUDIT SUPERVISION, COMPREHENSIVELY INCREASE AUDIT CAPACITY, GIVE GREATER EFFECT TO THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF AUDIT AND BOOST THE MODERNIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITY.
674	IN THIS ARTICLE SARAH GLASSMEYER AND PETE SMITH ADDRESS, AND FOCUS ON, 'OPEN LAW' AND THE TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT CAN ENABLE ACCESS TO PRIMARY LAW, AND THE SECONDARY MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
675	RULE OF LAW (ROL) BUILDING INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN CRITIQUED FOR IGNORING LOCAL NORMS AND CULTURE. THIS PROBLEM HAS DEFINED ROL INTERVENTIONS IN THE EASTERN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, LEADING TO UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LAW. I ENGAGE WITH THE SCHOLARSHIP ON 'HYBRIDITY' AND 'FRICTION' TO THEORIZE THESE UNANTICIPATED OUTCOMES, WHICH I LABEL EMERGENT HYBRID LEGALITY.' THIS CONCEPT REFLECTS A HIGHLY CONTEXTUALIZED ARRAY OF EMERGING LEGAL-JUSTICE IDEAS, PRACTICES, AND INSTITUTIONS. THESE OUTCOMES HELP EXPLAIN WHY ROL BUILDING DOES NOT SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS SET OUT BY INTERVENERS. MY RESEARCH IS BASED ON 8 MONTHS OF FIELDWORK IN UVIRA, DRC.
676	ROMANIA'S LEVEL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP WAS IN RECENT YEARS ONE OF THE LOWEST AMONG CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE) AND BALTIC COUNTRIES, ONLY HIGHER THAN IN HUNGARY AND BULGARIA. BASED ON PANEL DATA REGRESSIONS, OUR ESTIMATIONS SHOW THAT THERE ARE INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS WHICH EXPLAIN WHY ROMANIA IS UNDERPERFORMING. THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION ECONOMIES SUCH AS SLOVAKIA, CZECH REPUBLIC AND POLAND SEEM TO HAVE ALMOST ALL THE NECESSARY INGREDIENTS THAT ARE POSITIVE FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP - REGULATORY QUALITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND LABOR MARKET FLEXIBILITY. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO INCREASE ROMANIA'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP LEVEL WILL BE TO IMPROVE THE WEAKNESSES WE IDENTIFIED AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, AS INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP BASED ON OUR RESULTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME, THEIR WEEK VALUES SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN EXPLANATION WHY ROMANIA HAS A LOW ENTREPRENEURIAL LEVEL.
677	CRIMINAL LAW AND IMMIGRATION LAW, ONCE SEPARATE FIELDS OF GOVERNANCE IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE RAPIDLY GROWING LESS DISTINCT. IMMIGRATION CRIMES NOW ACCOUNT FOR A MAJORITY OF ALL FEDERAL PROSECUTIONS; DEPORTATION IS WIDELY SEEN AS A KEY TOOL OF CRIME CONTROL; IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES RUN THE NATION'S LARGEST PRISON SYSTEM; AND STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WORK HAND-IN-HAND WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THESE TRENDS AND ASSESSES THEIR SIGNIFICANCE. THE RISE OF AN INTERTWINED REGIME OF "CRIMMIGRATION" LAW HAS GENERALLY BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO SOME COMBINATION OF NATIVISM, OVERCRIMINALIZATION, AND A CULTURAL OBSESSION WITH SECURITY, BUT IT ALSO EXEMPLIFIES, AND HAS HELPED TO REINFORCE, A CRUCIAL AND UNDERAPPRECIATED DEVELOPMENT IN U.S. LEGAL CULTURE-A RISING TENDENCY TO TREAT LEGAL RULES AND LEGAL PROCEDURES AS INTERCHANGEABLE TOOLS, TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR PRAGMATICALLY AND INSTRUMENTALLY ON AN AD HOC BASIS. AD HOC INSTRUMENTALISM OF THIS KIND HAS GENUINE STRENGTHS, BUT IT ALSO RAISES SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ACCOUNTABILITY CONCERNS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE EXACERBATED BY TWO OTHER FEATURES OF OUR NEWLY MERGED SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE: ITS BUREAUCRATIC OPACITY AND ITS SELECTIVE APPLICATION.
678	COURTS SHAPE THE RULE OF LAW. THEIR HISTORY IS PART OF THE CULTURE OF A COUNTRY. THE WAY JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE TREATED CHARACTERISES A COUNTRY'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE STATUS THEY ACCORD TO COURTS AND JUDGES. IN ITS ALMOST 400-YEAR HISTORY, BAVARIA'S SUPREME COURT HAS EXPERIENCED ALL FACETS - FROM BEING HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM TO BEING ABOLISHED TWICE. ITS HISTORY IS A LESSON THAT POINTS TO THE FUTURE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPEAN LEGAL CULTURE.
679	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SHIFTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SECURITY CONCERNS AND MIGRATION LAW, CONSIDERING IN PARTICULAR THE TENSIONS IN THIS RELATIONSHIP SINCE THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. IT FOCUSES ON A SERIES OF HIGH PROFILE CASES TESTING PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF NON-NATIONALS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE UNITED STATES, NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA. THESE CASES ARE THE BASIS FOR THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRANSFORMED SECURITIZATION OF MIGRATION LAW LEADS TO A NEW CHALLENGE FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AS SECURITY BECOMES THE NORM FOR MIGRATION LAW, ITS TRADITIONAL EXCEPTIONALISM IS BEING CALLED INTO QUESTION.
680	IN THE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH WE PRESENT HERE AS THE INTRODUCTION TO A SET OF CASE STUDIES, WE FIRST ASSESS THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES, CONTENT AND OUTCOMES IN EIGHT COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION ON THE BASIS OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. SECOND, WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER, TO WHAT EXTENT, AND HOW DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. THESE INVESTIGATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT BY APPLYING AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK THAT WE DEVELOPED ELSEWHERE. IN CONTRAST TO OUR PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL FINDINGS DEMONSTRATING THAT ALL THE QUALITIES GO HAND IN HAND, THAT PARTICIPATION AND COMPETITION ARE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES, AND THAT THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES FORM A FUNNEL OF CAUSALITY, THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS A DIFFERENT SET OF CONCLUSIONS. IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES ARE WEAKLY RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER, DO NOT FORM A FUNNEL OF CAUSALITY, AND PARTICIPATION AND COMPETITION ARE NOT THE MAIN DRIVERS OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITY. THE DATA PRESENTED IN THE EMPIRICAL SECTION OF THE PAPER CLAIM THE EXISTENCE OF AN ASIA-PACIFIC EXCEPTIONALISM. BY CAREFULLY EXAMINING THE CASES INCLUDED IN OUR SAMPLE, WE PROVIDE A DETAILED EXPLANATION FOR WHY, AT LEAST AS FAR AS DEMOCRATIC QUALITIES ARE CONCERNED, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION MAY BE EXCEPTIONAL AND UNIQUE. WE REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT RESPONSIVENESS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY A TRANSITION FROM A RULE BY LAW - OFTEN COUPLED WITH THE PROMINENCE OF PATRONAGE, PATRIMONIALIST PRACTICES AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE ELITE - TO A PROPER RULE OF LAW.
681	THIS STUDY BUILDS ON THE EXISTING LAW AND FINANCE LITERATURE BY ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF LEGAL SYSTEMS ON BOTH THE LEVEL AND THE SOURCING OF WORKING CAPITAL. WE FIND THAT STRONGER RULE OF LAW RESULTS IN LOWER LEVELS OF WORKING CAPITAL, LESS SOURCING FROM RETAINED EARNINGS, AND MORE SOURCING FROM BANKS. FIRMS IN COMMON-LAW REGIMES HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCE IT FROM BANKS, WHILE FIRMS FROM CIVIL-LAW ENVIRONMENTS RELY ON RETAINED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR SOURCING. THE IMPACT OF LEGAL ORIGIN ON BOTH THE LEVEL AND THE SOURCING OF WORKING CAPITAL IS MIXED.
682	WE EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) ON FIRM VALUE USING A SAMPLE OF AFRICAN LISTED FIRMS SELECTED OVER THE 2000-2015 PERIOD. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ADOPTION OF IFRS POSITIVELY IMPACTS FIRM VALUE. WE FURTHER FIND THAT THE IMPACT OF IFRS ADOPTION ON FIRM VALUE IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE IS A GREATER COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. MOREOVER, THE INCREASE IN FIRM VALUE IS MORE PRONOUNCED FOR FIRMS WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS. FINALLY, ADDITIONAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BENEFITS OF FULLY IMPLEMENTING IFRS ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE ARISING FROM PARTIAL/MODIFIED ADOPTION. OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT FIRM VALUE AND TO ALTERNATIVE SAMPLING PROCEDURES.
683	THE PAPERS COLLECTED IN THIS FOCUS SECTION CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION OF JUSTICE. THE STARTING POINT CONSISTS IN TAKING SERIOUSLY THE ABILITY OF LAW TO REDUCE INJUSTICES DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A GLOBAL COERCIVE POWER. THE FIRST ARTICLE - BY GIANLUIGI PALOMBELLA - HIGHLIGHTS THE CAPACITY OF LAW TO INDEPENDENTLY DEFINE THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF A GLOBAL LEGAL CONTEXT AIMED AT REDUCING INJUSTICE: A LAW WITHOUT A STATE, COMMITTED TO COPING WITH COMPLEXITY, INDIVISIBILITY, INTERDEPENDENCE. IN THE SECOND ARTICLE JAN KLABBERS CLAIMS THAT THE RULE OF LAW ALONE DOES NOT BRING ANY DECISIVE ADVANTAGE UNLESS IT IS SUSTAINED BY "VIRTUOUS" OFFICIALS ABLE TO IDENTIFY ADEQUATE SOLUTIONS. THE PERINCEK CASE HIGHLIGHTS THE BUREAUCRATIZATION OF LAW AND THE TRIVIALIZATION OF RIGHTS BY THE VERY COURTS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PROTECTION. IN THE THIRD ARTICLE, SAMANTHA BESSON ARGUES FOR A POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES AND THEIR CITIZENS FOR THE WRONGFUL ACTS COMMITTED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE CORE OF BESSON'S THESIS TURNS THE IDEA OF RESPONSIBILITY INTO WIDER MORAL GROUNDS, BY ALSO CONSIDERING MILESTONE CASES AND BY FREEING THE DISCUSSION FROM TRADITIONAL MODELS OF TORT LAW.
684	A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN OF GOVERNMENT IS GETTING CITIZENS TO COMPLY WITH ITS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YET, THIS TOPIC HAS RECEIVED RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION IN LEGAL OR SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP. WE EXPLORE THE DEGREE TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL OBEDIENCE. WE EMPLOY A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL APPROACH TO ASSAYING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE CITIZENS' BELIEFS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPLYING WITH GOVERNMENT RULES. WE FIND THAT CITIZENS' PERCEPTIONS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, JUSTICE SYSTEM SCANDALS, AND SOCIAL CAPITAL CONSIDERATIONS CAN IMPACT CITIZENS' BELIEFS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OBEYING THE LAW.
685	IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THAT VIBRANT CIVIL SOCIETY IS PRECONDITION FOR DEMOCRACY, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. FOLLOWING THIS ASSUMPTION, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS AND EVEN GOVERNMENTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN ACTIVITIES AIMING FOR THE SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, THAT IS, ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TOWARDS SOCIETIES. IN THIS ARTICLE I AM ANALYZING ACTIVITIES OF PROMINENT SERBIAN NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) IN THE FIELD OF FOSTERING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THEIR ABILITY TO SHIFT THE BALANCE OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL POWER AWAY FROM THE STATE. THE ANALYSIS IS PRIMARILY BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED THROUGH A SERIES OF IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF NGOS. IT REVEALS THAT NGOS FOLLOW POLICY-NOT-POLITICS, THAT IS, A DEPOLITICIZED APPROACH, THAT THEY TARGET INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND NOT SOCIAL GROUPS AND NURTURE RELATIONSHIPS WITH STATE INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS WITH WHOM THEY COOPERATE. THEY DEMONSTRATE A WEAK ABILITY TO (1) INITIATE WIDER CIVIC MOBILIZATION OR (2) ESTABLISH SOLID INSTITUTIONAL PRECONDITIONS FOR GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. THUS, AVAILABLE DATA SUGGESTS THAT SERBIAN NGOS HAVE WEAK POTENTIAL TO CONTEST POWER OF THE STATE AND THUS CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW.
686	LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE INCREASINGLY ABLE TO LEVERAGE CRIME STATISTICS TO MAKE RISK PREDICTIONS FOR PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS, EMPLOYING A FORM OF INFERENCE THAT SOME CONDEMN AS VIOLATING THE RIGHT TO BE "TREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL." I SUGGEST THAT THE RIGHT ENCODES AGENTS' ENTITLEMENT TO A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDENS AND BENEFITS OF THE RULE OF LAW. RATHER THAN PRECLUDING STATISTICAL PREDICTION, IT REQUIRES THAT CITIZENS BE ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHICH VARIABLES WILL BE USED AS PREDICTORS AND ACT INTENTIONALLY TO AVOID THEM. FURTHERMORE, IT CONDEMNS RELIANCE ON VARIOUS INDEXES OF DISTRIBUTIVE INJUSTICE, OR UNCHOSEN PROPERTIES, AS EVIDENCE OF LAW-BREAKING.
687	ALTHOUGH UKRAINIAN DEMOCRACY HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS SINCE THE 2004 ORANGE REVOLUTION, SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS REMAIN. THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE DIFFICULTIES FACING POST-ORANGE REVOLUTION UKRAINE TO THOSE ENCOUNTERED IN EAST CENTRAL EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1990S AND MAINTAINS THAT UKRAINE WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME OVERCOMING ITS CHALLENGES BECAUSE ITS STARTING POINT AND INHERITANCES ARE DIFFERENT. THAT IS, UKRAINIAN DEMOCRACY MUST OVERCOME MANY OF THE INFIRMITIES CREATED DURING ITS INITIAL DECADE OF POST-COMMUNISM, AND THAT THESE MAKE ESTABLISHING EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN TODAY'S POST-POST-COMMUNIST PERIOD ARDUOUS. AMONG THE DIFFICULTIES ARE DESIGNING EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS, MANAGING THE POST-ORANGE REVOLUTION COALITION, REMOVING ENTRENCHED CORRUPTION AND WEAK RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND COPING WITH A LESS HOSPITABLE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. EVENTS SINCE THE ORANGE REVOLUTION BEAR OUT THE ARGUMENT THAT THE EVENTS OF 2004, WHILE GETTING RID OF A LEADERSHIP WITH DUBIOUS DEMOCRATIC CREDENTIALS, ARE MERELY THE BEGINNING OF A PROCESS TO BRING A SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT TO UKRAINE.
688	IN THE PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, IRELAND HAS MOVED FROM A TRADITIONAL COMMON LAW MODEL OF JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION, IN WHICH KEY ASPECTS OF JUDICIAL CAREERS AND ADMINISTRATION WERE HANDLED INFORMALLY AND POLITICALLY, TO A MUCH MORE FORMAL SYSTEM DESIGNED ALONG EUROPEAN LINES. THIS TRANSITION IS DRIVEN BY IRISH JUDGES AND POLITICIANS AND INFLUENCED HEAVILY BY EU AND COUNCIL OF EUROPE SOFT LAW ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE I SKETCH AN OUTLINE OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS IN IRELAND BEFORE FOCUSING ON TWO TOPICS THAT EXEMPLIFY THE TRANSITION: JUDICIAL CONDUCT AND JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. I ARGUE THAT THE MOVE TO FORMALIZE JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION IN IRELAND IS ROOTED IN A DESIRE TO FOLLOW BEST PRACTICE BUT ALSO TO AVOID POLITICALLY DIFFICULT REFORMS IN OTHER AREAS.
689	SCHOLARS CONTINUE TO DISAGREE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REGIME TYPE AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE, PERHAPS BECAUSE THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE REMAINS CONTRADICTORY. TO DATE, MOST STUDIES GENERALLY EXPLORE THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TERRORISM. YET, WE THINK THE EFFECT OF REGIME TYPE ON TERRORISM IS CONDITIONAL ON THE PRESENCE OF POLITICALLY EXCLUDED GROUPS WHOSE GRIEVANCES MOTIVATE THEM TO CHALLENGE THE STATE. WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BOTH WILLINGNESS/GRIEVANCE AND OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND POLITICAL VIOLENCE. USING A GLOBAL DATA SET OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM BETWEEN 1990 AND 2012, WE FIND THAT DIFFERENT REGIME-ASSOCIATED FEATURES OF DEMOCRACY RELATE DIFFERENTLY TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM. HIGHER LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW TEND TO DECREASE TERRORISM, WHEREAS ELECTORAL DEMOCRACIES TEND TO EXPERIENCE MORE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. HOWEVER, DOMESTIC TERRORISM INCREASES IN EVERY FORM OF DEMOCRACY IN THE PRESENCE OF POLITICAL EXCLUSION. AS SUCH, AN EFFECTIVE COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY MUST ADDRESS UNDERLYING GRIEVANCES AS DEMOCRATIZATION BY ITSELF MAY ACTUALLY DRIVE DOMESTIC TERRORISM UP.
690	PURPOSE - FOLLOWING THE DEMISE OF THE SOVIET UNION IN 1992, RUSSIA UNDERTOOK MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL AND MARKET-ORIENTED REFORMS TO ENHANCE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF DOMESTIC ENTERPRISES. ALTHOUGH RUSSIA HAS EXPERIENCED RAPID GROWTH OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSTITUTIONS IN RUSSIA IMPACT ON FIRM INNOVATION AND PERFORMANCE REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD DUE TO A LACK OF RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF RUSSIAN FIRMS BY FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STATE OF THE REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION AFFECT THE INNOVATION CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IN RUSSIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY USES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING AND DATA FROM A LARGE-SCALE FIRM LEVEL SURVEY (N = 787) OF FIRMS IN RUSSIA UNDERTAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK IN 2009. IT INVESTIGATES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT PERCEPTIONS OF RESPONDENTS OF THE EFFECTS THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT HAS ON THE INNOVATION CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ORGANISATIONS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THAT REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION HAVE STRONG DIRECT AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON BOTH THE INNOVATION CAPACITY AND PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS, AND THAT INNOVATION CAPACITY STRONGLY MEDIATES THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON FIRM PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA INHIBIT FIRM INNOVATION AND THEIR RESULTING PERFORMANCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO ONLY THREE ELEMENTS OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE ROLE OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE TWO LIMITATIONS PRESENT AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH FORMAL INSTITUTIONS INHIBIT INNOVATION AND FIRM PERFORMANCE IN RUSSIA, AND PROVIDES VALUABLE GUIDANCE TO BUSINESS POLICY-MAKERS IN RUSSIA ON POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR ENHANCING THE OVERALL COMPETITIVENESS OF RUSSIAN FIRMS.
691	MODERN GOVERNMENTS STRIVE TO ENHANCE THEIR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPACITY AND ESTABLISH MULTIPLE POLICY TOOLS THAT CAN HELP REDUCE DAMAGE CAUSED BY NATURAL AND HUMAN HAZARDS. AMONG THESE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS, THE CONSTITUTION IN TAIWAN ENTRUSTS PRESIDENTS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ACT IMMEDIATELY IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NECESSITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) HOW DOES THE TAIWANESE GOVERNMENT RESPOND TO A PANDEMIC AND TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THIS SITUATION AFFECT THE TAIWANESE GOVERNMENTAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE POWERS? (2) DO THE TAIWANESE GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTIONS CONTRADICT DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND CIVIL LIBERTIES? BY ANALYZING THE BOUNDARIES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY POWER, DEMONSTRATING PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF THE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF TAIWANESE PRESIDENTS REGARDING THEIR USE OF THE EMERGENCY POWER TO ADDRESS CATASTROPHIC DISASTERS, AND EXPLORING PREEMPTIVE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE AUTHORS ARGUE TWO POINTS: (1) TAIWAN'S ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSE TO COVID-19 REVEALS A TENDENCY TOWARD HAVING AUTHORITY VASTLY CENTRALIZED AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL THROUGH BLANK-CHECK AUTHORIZATION, AND THIS REPRESENTS THE PRESUMPTIVE ALLOCATION OF POWER EMBODIED IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA CONSTITUTION, WHICH HAS GRADUALLY EXPANDED. (2) THE VAGUE AND UNFETTERED LEGAL AUTHORIZATION BY THE CDC AND THE COVID-19 SPECIAL ACT MAY DIMINISH THE SUBSTANTIAL RULE OF LAW IN THE LONG RUN. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES, BY APPLYING THE ASSESSMENT FROM A VARIETY OF KEY PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, TAIWAN EXHIBITED HOW IT HAS INTEGRATED INSTITUTIONAL MEMORIES AND PAST LESSONS. HOWEVER, THERE CONTINUES TO BE IN TAIWAN AN OVERDEPENDENT RELIANCE ON STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION WITH THE INHERENT RISK OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE IN EXPLOITING LEGAL AUTHORIZATION, COUPLED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE BLIND SPOTS, THAT CAN GENERATE DISPROPORTIONATE PUBLIC MEASURES. THIS LEVERAGE, WE ARGUE, SUPERSEDES THE PRESIDENT'S DISCRETIONARY EMERGENCY POWER, ENABLING EMERGENCY LEGISLATION WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT, PREVAILING OVER ORDINARY CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, AND POSSIBLY PRODUCING A CORROSIVE EFFECT ON CIVIL LIBERTIES AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LONG TERM.
692	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND FEATURES OF THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW, AS WELL AS THEIR DIFFERENCES. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE STUDY IS THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY INCLUDES THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING SCIENTIFIC METHODS: ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, FORMAL AND DOGMATIC, SYSTEM AND STRUCTURAL, HERMENEUTIC, SYNERGETIC. RESULTS OF THE STUDY. THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ANALYZED AND ITS FEATURES ARE OUTLINED. THE CONCEPTS OF RULES OF NATIONAL LAW AND RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE PROVIDED. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RULES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ARE REVEALED. THE PROCEDURE FOR ENSURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IS CONSIDERED. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION. SOME PROBLEMATIC ISSUES ARISING FROM THE INTERACTION OF RULES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW ARE INVESTIGATED. VALUE / ORIGINALITY. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE NEED FOR INTERACTION OF RULES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW TO IMPROVE THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM.
693	A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED ORGANISATIONAL-LEVEL AND SECTORIAL-LEVEL DETERMINANTS OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICE (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS CSP) SUCH AS BOARD ATTRIBUTES, AUDIT COMMITTEE MEETINGS, SHAREHOLDERS' ACTIVISM, OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED COMPENSATION, AND INDUSTRY TYPE. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, AS THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION USING INTERCOUNTRY EVIDENCE; THEREFORE, STUDIES THAT FOCUS ON COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FACTORS AFFECTING CSP ARE SCARCE. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE CURRENT STUDY INVESTIGATES COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FACTORS (I.E., VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM; GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; REGULATORY QUALITY; RULE OF LAW; AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) AND NATIONAL CULTURE DIMENSIONS PROPOSED BY HOFSTEDE (I.E., POWER DISTANCE; INDIVIDUALISM; MASCULINITY; UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE; LONG-TERM ORIENTATION; AND INDULGENCE) AFFECTING CSP IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT OF 204 OIL AND GAS FIRMS CUTTING ACROSS 36 COUNTRIES OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD (2011-2020). RESULT FROM THE ANALYSIS USING MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION, GENERALISED LINEAR MODELS REGRESSION AND DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE FACTOR STRONGLY PROMOTING CSP IS THE RULE OF LAW, WHILST FOUR OF THE NATIONAL CULTURE FACTOR POSITIVELY INFLUENCE ON CSP EXCEPT POWER DISTANCE AND MASCULINITY. THIS CURRENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO KNOWLEDGE BY PRESENTING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL AND NATIONAL CULTURE FACTORS AFFECT CSP. THE STUDY, THUS, ARGUES FOR THE INCLUSION OF COUNTRY GOVERNANCE FACTORS AND CULTURAL DIMENSION THAT MAY AFFECT CSP IN ADDITION TO OTHER WELL-KNOWN FACTORS AFFECTING SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICE. THE STUDY ALSO ADDS TO LITERATURE BY PROVIDING EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THE HOFSTEDE MODEL ON NATIONAL CULTURAL DIMENSIONS AFFECTING ACCOUNTING AND ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICE.
694	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERROR, POWER AND THE RULE OF LAW. FIRST, TRACING BURKE'S USE OF THE TERM TERROR BACK TO ANCIENT GREEK USAGE, I ARGUE THAT BEING TERRIFIED IS INCOMMENSURABLE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF ACTING TOGETHER WITH OTHERS. IN THIS WAY, TERROR AND POWER ARE DISTINCT. HOWEVER, MOST ACTS OF TERROR AIM TO TERRIFY SOME PEOPLE WHILE INOCULATING OTHERS FROM TERROR. WITNESSES TO THE TERROR OF OTHERS MAY FEEL EMPOWERED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE POWER OF OTHERS. SECOND, THE RULE OF LAW AND TERROR SEEM INCOMMENSURABLE BECAUSE CAUSING TERROR OFTEN INVOLVES VIOLATING THE LAW. HOWEVER, MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT IS FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT THE LAW ITSELF OUGHT TO BE TERRIFYING. THAT THE TERROR OF NON-STATE ACTORS APPEARS RANDOM AND THE TERROR OF THE LAW HAS HARDLY BEEN NOTICED IN RECENT COMMENTARY ON TERRORISM INDICATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW PRODUCES AN INTERESTING AUDIENCE EFFECT. IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN POWER AND LEGITIMACY WHILE PRACTISING TERROR, GOVERNMENTS USE THE RULE OF LAW TO DIVIDE AUDIENCES UP INTO TERRIFIED CRIMINALS AND INNOCENT WITNESSES. THE PRACTICE OF TERROR AS AN 'OPEN SECRET' ALSO PRODUCES SIMILAR AUDIENCE EFFECTS. FINALLY, DESPITE THESE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN POWER, TERROR AND THE RULE OF LAW, I ARGUE THAT TERROR IS ALWAYS TECHNICALLY OUT OF POWER, EVEN WHEN PRACTISED BY STATES. TERROR IS THE TRUE WEAPON OF THE WEAK BECAUSE IT ALWAYS ADMITS A FAILURE TO FOSTER HUMAN CONNECTIONS WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AND GROUPS. NONVIOLENCE IS A WEAPON OF THE WEAK IN THE SENSE THAT IT INSTANTIATES NEW, UNENCUMBERED POWER.
695	THIS ARTICLE COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LUSAKA CEASEFIRE AGREEMENT 1999 BY THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, THE PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE AND THE REVOLUTIONARY UNITED FRONT OF SIERRA LEONE BY THE SPECIAL COURT FOR SIERRA LEONE, AND THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT FOR PEACE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN DOING SO, IT CRITICALLY ANALYSES THE APPROACH OF THE THREE DIFFERENT TRIBUNALS AND ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES IDENTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THE JURISDICTIONAL SCOPE OF EACH TRIBUNAL AND THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW EACH HAS BEEN TASKED TO APPLY. THIS COMPARISON IS BOTH SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL. THE ARTICLE THEN EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF THESE THREE TRIBUNALS ON TWO SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW: LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY, BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND IN THE COUNTRIES UNDER EXAMINATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT, WHILE THESE TRIBUNALS HAVE ENHANCED LEGAL CERTAINTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, ANY CONTRIBUTION THEY HAVE MADE TO THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN QUESTIONABLE.
696	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH SOME ISSUES OF THE STATE POWER RESTRICTION, AND THE NECESSITY OF THIS IS JUSTIFIED. THE EVOLUTION OF STATE POWER RESTRICTION CERTAIN CRITERIA AND FORMS ARE ANALYZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMERGENCE OF RELEVANT IDEAS AND SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY: THE RESTRICTION OF POWER BY ANOTHER POWER, SELF-RESTRAINT OF STATE POWER; THE RESTRICTION OF STATE POWER BY THE LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF STATE POWER RESTRICTIONS IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW.
697	IN TODAY'S DEMOCRACIES JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL POWERS HAVE DIFFERENT LEGITIMACY FOUNDATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE PUBLIC FUNCTIONS: THE FIRST, ENTRUSTED WITH A GUARANTEE FUNCTION, IS CHARACTERIZED BY A NEW FORM OF "LEGITIMACY BASED UPON IMPARTIALITY AND REFLEXIVITY", AS TYPICAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS; BY CONSTRAST, POLITICAL POWER, ENDOWED WITH GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, REMAINS BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL "ELECTORAL-REPRESENTATIVE LEGITIMACY", WHICH, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO A VERIFICATION OF SUBSTANTIAL LEGITIMACY IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS CODIFIED IN THE CONSTITUTION. BY APPLYING THESE FOUNDATIONS TO THE ITALIAN CONTEXT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PERIODS (LEGISLATURES) XII, XIV AND XVI, AND CONSIDERING THE JUDICIARY, ONE CAN REJECT CERTAIN MAJORITY THEORIES PROPOSED IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE, I.E., ON THE ONE HAND, THE THEORY OF ITS LOWER DEGREE OF LEGITIMACY IN COMPARISON TO THE POLITICAL POWER, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE THEORY OF ITS ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WHEN QUESTIONING THE POLITICAL LEGITIMACY. CONSIDERING POLITICS, AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTS OF BERLUSCONI'S GOVERNMENT WHICH FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM (ESPECIALLY THE SO CALLED AD PERSONAM LAWS) SEEMS TO BRING INTO EXISTENCE -IN ACCORDANCE WITH WEBER CODIFICATION- A NEW LEGITIMIZING PRINCIPLE OTHER THAN THE RULE OF LAW.
698	SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION IN LATE 2013, THE EU JUSTICE SCOREBOARD ALLOWS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT DESPITE BEING A TECHNICAL POLICY INSTRUMENT, THE EU JUSTICE SCOREBOARD HAS THE LONG-TERM POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE DIVISION OF COMPETENCES BETWEEN MEMBER STATES AND SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE DOMAIN OF RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON THREE META-THEORIES OF EU INTEGRATION, NEOFUNCTIONALISM, NEW INTERGOVERNMENTALISM AND GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES WHICH THEORETICAL APPROACH BEST EXPLAINS THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS POLICY INSTRUMENT. ALTHOUGH IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IN THE CASE OF THE EU JUSTICE SCOREBOARD, INSIGHTS FROM BOTH NEOFUNCTIONALISM AND NEW INTERGOVERNMENTALISM HAVE BETTER EXPLANATORY POWER, THIS ARTICLE STRESSES THE NEED TO COMBINE VARIOUS THEORETICAL ACCOUNTS FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF EU POLICY PROCESSES.
699	THIS A REVIEW ARTICLE OF MARTIN LOUGHLIN, FOUNDATIONS OF PUBLIC LAW (OXFORD: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 2010). THE PROMISE OF THE BOOK IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL OF PUBLIC LAW UNDERSTOOD AS A PRUDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF PUBLIC RIGHT WILL SHOW US HOW LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES HAVE LEARNED TO NEGOTIATE BETWEEN THE HORNS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DILEMMA LOUGHLIN SUPPOSES WE FACE. THIS IS THE DILEMMA ARTICULATED BY ROUSSEAU: ON THE ONE HAND, A SOCIETY HAS TO TAKE DELIBERATE STEPS TO PRODUCE THROUGH LAW FREE CITIZENS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS ONE IN WHICH FREEDOM ENDURES, WHILE, ON THE OTHER HAND, SUCH STEPS CREATE THE DANGER OF 'BUREAUCRATIC OPPRESSION' OF THE SORT THAT PRODUCES A SOCIETY COMPOSED OF CHIEFS AND SLAVES. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF THE BOOK, LOUGHLIN SUGGESTS THAT THE DILEMMA HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND THAT WE ARE IN DANGER OF FINDING OURSELVES LIVING, OR PERHAPS EVEN ARE ALREADY LIVING, IN THE SOCIETY OF CHIEFS AND SLAVES. AND IF THE IDEA OF PUBLIC RIGHT IS RETRIEVED ONLY TO SHOW THAT IT IS EITHER MORIBUND OR DEAD, WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF WHAT FA HAYEK CALLED IN 1944 'THE ROAD TO SERFDOM.'I ARGUE THAT LOUGHLIN COMES TO THIS SURPRISING CONCLUSION BECAUSE OF A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN HIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, IN WHICH HE BOTH REDUCES THE RULE OF LAW TO AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER AND SUGGESTS THAT IT HAS TO FAIL ON ITS OWN TERMS.
700	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELATION BETWEEN FUNCTION AND FORM IN THE MAIN AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS, DRAWING ON PROCESS JURISPRUDENCE, IN PARTICULAR THE WORK OF LON FULLER. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE STRUCTURES AND PROCEDURES OF THE TRIBUNALS CAN BE SET AGAINST FULLER'S IDEALIZED FEATURES OF ADJUDICATION, IN ORDER TO DRAW OUT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT AND INNOVATIVE FEATURES. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE THE DISTINCTIVE WAYS THAT THE TRIBUNALS HAVE MEDIATED THE PARTICIPATION OF THE INDUSTRIAL PARTIES AND TACKLED COMPLICATED PROBLEMS SUCH AS WAGE-SETTING. THE AIM IS TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON PROCEDURAL DESIGN AND ENCOURAGE RESEARCH INTO THE TRIBUNALS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INDUSTRIAL CONTEXT. THIS SHOULD ALSO LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTINUITIES, DISCONTINUITIES AND DILEMMAS REPRESENTED IN THE NEW UMPIRE, FAIR WORK AUSTRALIA.
701	HOW DO PERSONAL ENCOUNTERS WITH LEGAL INSTITUTIONS SHAPE CITIZENS' CONFIDENCE IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA? USING AFROBAROMETER'S CROSS-NATIONAL CITIZEN SURVEY, WE SHOW THAT NEGATIVE FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCES WITH GOVERNMENT COURTS AND POLICE ERODE CITIZENS' TRUST IN THOSE STATE INSTITUTIONS BUT DO NOT TEND TO DISRUPT CITIZENS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATE OR ENFORCE THE LAW. INDIVIDUALS FROM DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUNDS IMBUE STATE INSTITUTIONS WITH THE RIGHT TO PERFORM THEIR GOVERNANCE AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT DUTIES, EVEN AFTER EXPERIENCING INSTITUTIONAL INCOMPETENCE OR INJUSTICE. THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES EXISTING COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH TENDS TO CONFLATE TRUST AND LEGITIMACY AND OVERLOOKS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DE FACTO PERFORMANCE AND DE JURE AUTHORITY. WE SUGGEST THAT RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEEPER ROOTS THAN SOME SCHOLARS HAVE PREVIOUSLY SUPPOSED.
702	DURING THE 2021 MASS PROTESTS IN COLOMBIA, AND WHILE INTERNATIONAL CALLS FOR THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS WERE INTENSIFYING, CANADA'S POSITION REMAINED SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS. PART OF CANADA'S AMBIGUITY CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A SIMPLISTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF COLOMBIA AS A "WEAK STATE." THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES CANADA'S BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP BY HISTORIZING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLOMBIA'S GOVERNANCE IN THE KEY OVERLAPPING SECTORS OF SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND NATURAL RESOURCES. FROM EXTENSIVE FIELDWORK, WE DISTINGUISH TWO COMPETING RATIONALITIES BASED ON THE ARTICULATION OF THE NOTIONS OF "CONFLICT" AND "DISSENT" WITH THE NOTION OF THE "RULE OF LAW." WE BELIEVE THAT CANADA'S BILATERAL RELATION WITH COLOMBIA IN THE LAST DECADES HAS OVERLOOKED THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST BETWEEN DEMOCRATIZING RATIONALITIES AND ANTIPOLITICAL RATIONALITIES. AS A RESULT, CANADA'S FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN BASED ON AN OVERLY SIMPLISTIC CONCEPTION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT, SECURITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
703	THE CONCEPTS LINKED IN THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THE LEXICON OF PRINCIPIA IURIS. HOWEVER THEY REFER NEATLY TO TWO BASIC NOTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW STATE: THE SUBSTANTIAL DIMENSION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE ESSENTIAL ROLE PLAYED BY INSTITUTIONS OF SAFEGUARD, CLEARLY SEPARATE FROM INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT ON THE BASIS OF ITS SOURCE OF LEGITIMACY, ITS FUNCTION AND THE WAY THEY OPERATE. THIS DISTINCTION LEADS FERRAJOLI TO RETHINK IN DEPTH THE PUBLIC SPHERE, PARTICULARLY AS REGARDS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TRADITIONAL PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, WHICH IS NECESSARY IN ORDEN TO EXPLAIN THE INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THIS MODEL OF STATE.
704	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL AND TRIAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL LEADER BO XILAI IN 2012 AND 2013 AND THE DISCOURSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCANDAL IN THE YEARS AFTERWARD. IT FOCUSES ON HOW MAINSTREAM MEDIA DISCOURSES PORTRAYED THE TRIAL, DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM OF OFFICIAL CORRUPTION, AND ARTICULATED THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF RESPONSIVE AUTHORITARIANISM. THE BO XILAI TRIAL DIFFERED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE TYPICAL MEDIATED SCANDAL EVENT IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THE CASE ILLUSTRATED HOW POLITICAL SCANDALS IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA CAN BE OCCASIONS FOR POWER HOLDERS TO PRESENT AN IMAGE OF BEING WILLING TO ADDRESS PUBLIC CONCERNS AND DETERMINED TO SOLVE SOCIAL PROBLEMS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT POLITICAL SCANDALS CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ARTICULATION AND PROPAGATION OF THE POWER HOLDERS' PREFERRED CONCEPTION OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL REFORM.
705	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE IN TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE. THE GOAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM OF INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE AND TO EXTEND ITS DEFINITION IN TERMS OF UNACCEPTABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR BASIC SOCIAL VALUES (FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, SECURITY, ETC.). IN THE POST-SOCIALIST COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION, SOCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY, IMPACTING THE EMERGENCE OF NEW FORMS OF INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE. IT STARTS WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT QUASI-INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS HAVE LED TO AN INCREASE IN INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE IN THE OBSERVED COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO THE SURVEY OF RESPONDENTS, THE METHOD OF MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS ALSO USED. THE CONCLUSION WAS MADE ON THE VERIFICATION OF THE BASIC HYPOTHESIS, AND ON THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST EUROPE.
706	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A RADICAL RECASTING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT DEBATE. CRITICS HAVE LONG ARGUED THAT THE EU SUFFERS FROM A DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT AND THAT GROWING EU POWER UNDERMINES NATIONAL DEMOCRACY. BUT RECENT BACKSLIDING ON DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND REMINDS US THAT GRAVE DEMOCRATIC DEFICITS CAN ALSO EXIST AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IN MEMBER STATES AND THAT THE EU MAY HAVE A ROLE IN ADDRESSING THEM. THIS ARTICLE WILL PLACE THE EU'S STRUGGLES WITH DEMOCRATIC DEFICITS IN ITS MEMBER STATES IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER DEMOCRACIES THAT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH POCKETS OF SUBNATIONAL AUTHORITARIANISM. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT CONSIDERATIONS DRIVEN BY PARTISAN POLITICS MAY ALLOW LOCAL POCKETS OF AUTOCRACY TO PERSIST WITHIN OTHERWISE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL UNIONS.
707	AS A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING COUNTRY, INDONESIA REALIZES THAT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) REMAINS NECESSARY TO FUEL GROWTH IN THE CAPITAL-SCARCE COUNTRY. YET, ALONG WITH ITS DEVELOPMENT, INDONESIA IS FACING MORE COMPLEX CHALLENGES BOTH BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC ISSUES AND ITS PROBLEMATIC BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES (BITS) WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE EXPLICIT POLICY SPACE FOR THE GOVERNMENT. THE PROBLEMATIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DESENTRALISASI SYSTEM, A LIMITED RULE OF LAW AND DIFFICULTIES IN DEALING WITH CORRUPTION CONTINUE TO REDUCE INDONESIA'S ATTRACTIVENESS TO FOREIGN INVESTORS. INDONESIA HAS DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE ITS OLD BITS AND HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN DESIGNING A NEW BIT MODEL. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO SUGGEST WAYS IN WHICH INDONESIA CAN DEAL WITH ITS DOMESTIC CHALLENGES AND TO IMPROVE ITS NEW INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS TO CREATE A MORE CONDUCIVE INVESTMENT CLIMATE.
708	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PRACTICES OF VIOLENCE DURING STRIKES IN HABSBURG AUSTRIA FROM THE 1890S UNTIL THE OUTBREAK OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR. AS THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS ROSE AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, STRIKES INCREASINGLY BECAME ONE OF THE MAIN SITES OF PUBLIC VIOLENCE IN AUSTRIAN SOCIETY, ALONGSIDE DEMONSTRATIONS. VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN STRIKERS, STRIKE-BREAKERS, AND THE STATE FORCES PROTECTING THEM FREQUENTLY OCCURRED. THE FIRST SECTION DISCUSSES THE STATE REPRESSION USED TO QUELL INTERNAL UNREST AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS EXPLORE THE MICRO-DYNAMICS OF STRIKEBREAKING WITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE REACTION AGAINST SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN THE PERIOD. ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL MOBILIZATION FOR SUFFRAGE REFORM IN 1905-906, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER PROPERTIED CLASSES SAW STRIKERS AS PART OF A GENERAL THREAT. THE CZECH AND GERMAN NATIONALIST WORKERS' MOVEMENTS CAN ALSO BE REASSESSED THROUGH THE LENS OF THESE SOCIAL CONFLICTS, RATHER THAN ONLY AS MANIFESTATIONS OF RADICAL NATIONALISM. STRIKES ARE HERE ANALYSED AS ONE CASE STUDY ADDRESSING CURRENT DEBATES IN THE HISTORIOGRAPHY ON THE HABSBURG EMPIRE: FIRST ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE GROUND IN HABSBURG AUSTRIA, THEN ON THE IMPACT OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE DECADES BEFORE 1914.
709	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REGIME CHARACTERISTICS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) TERRORIST INCIDENTS. ODDS RATIOS ESTABLISH THAT DEMOCRATIC IDEALS-DEMOCRATIC RULE, STRONG RULE OF LAW, AND HONEST REGIMES-ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE CBRN INCIDENTS. FAILED STATES MAY BE WHERE SOME TERRORIST GROUPS FORM OR TAKE REFUGE, BUT THESE STATES HAVE NOT BEEN THE VENUE OF CHOICE FOR CBRN INCIDENTS. RELIGIOUS (CULTS AND FUNDAMENTALISTS) AND NATIONALIST/SEPARATIST GROUPS ARE NOT MORE LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO ENGAGE IN CBRN ATTACKS. TO DATE, INDISCRIMINATE CBRN ATTACKS ARE AS LIKELY AS DISCRIMINATE ATTACKS TO CAUSE CASUALTIES. TRANSNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUPS ARE LESS ADEPT THAN OTHERS IN CONCEALING THEIR ACQUISITION OF CBRN SUBSTANCES. FOR SOME REGRESSIONS, DEMOCRATIC RULE AND STRONG RULE OF LAW ARE POSITIVE DETERMINANTS OF CBRN INCIDENTS.
710	THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT HOW LOGIC MAY UNDERMINE A PARLIAMENTARY ASSAULT ON DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS (REPRESENTING LEGAL GUARANTEES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL FREEDOM) BASED ON THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED WITH REFERENCE TO THE SO-CALLED POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. I ANALYSE WHETHER A LAW CAN BE REVIEWED ON THE BASIS OF THIS LAW ITSELF. THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL FACED SUCH A PROBLEM WHILE PASSING THE VERDICT OF 9TH MARCH, 2016, REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE STATUTE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL FROM 22ND DECEMBER, 2015. THIS PROBLEM, CALLED A 'VERDICT PARADOX', WAS CLAIMED TO BE A TYPE OF THE LIAR PARADOX. I ARGUE THAT, CONTRARY TO THE COMMON VIEW, THE PROBLEM OF THE VERDICT PARADOX IS NOT BASED ON THE LIAR PARADOX; FOR THIS PURPOSE, A LOGICAL ANALYSIS IS APPLIED TO FOUR VARIANTS OF A REASONING WITH REGARD TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE SAID AMENDMENT. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO LEVELS OF ANALYSIS CONCERNING EMERGING REASONINGS, NAMELY AN ABSTRACT (LOGICAL) LEVEL AND A CONCRETE LEVEL PLACED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, IS ALSO INTRODUCED. THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO VARIANTS OF THE REASONING CONCERNING A LAW'S JUDICIAL REVIEW BASED ON THE LAW ITSELF INVOLVE LOGICAL CONTRADICTION, THE POSSIBILITY OF EMPLOYING REASONINGS FROM OTHER VARIANTS MUST BE EXCLUDED, ALBEIT DUE TO ALTERNATIVE REASONS. THEREFORE, THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL'S DECISION TO AVOID THE VERDICT PARADOX BY PASSING OVER THE REVIEWED PROVISIONS IN THE REVIEW PROCESS WAS CORRECT AND MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW LOGIC AND REASON CAN DEFEND THE INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF POLITICAL FREEDOM.
711	LEGAL PLURALISM HAS VAST POLICY AND GOVERNANCE IMPLICATIONS. IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, FOR INSTANCE, NON-STATE JUSTICE SYSTEMS OFTEN HANDLE MOST DISPUTES AND RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL AUTONOMY AND AUTHORITY. LEGAL PLURALISM'S IMPORTANCE, HOWEVER, IS RARELY RECOGNIZED AND DRAMATICALLY UNDER THEORIZED. THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES SCHOLARLY UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL PLURALISM BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY. IT PROPOSES A NEW TYPOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONCEPTUALIZING LEGAL PLURALISM THROUGH FOUR DISTINCT ARCHETYPES COMBATIVE, COMPETITIVE, COOPERATIVE, AND COMPLEMENTARY TO HELP CLARIFY THE RANGE OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS. IT POSITS FIVE MAIN STRATEGIES USED BY DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ACTORS IN ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND NON-STATE JUSTICE SYSTEMS: BRIDGING, HARMONIZATION, INCORPORATION, SUBSIDIZATION, AND REPRESSION. AS POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS ARE FLUID AND CAN FEATURE A WIDE RANGE OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS, THEY ARE PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE FOR SHOWING HOW LEGAL PLURALISM ARCHETYPES CAN BE SHIFTED OVER TIME. CASE STUDIES FROM TIMOR-LESTE AND AFGHANISTAN HIGHLIGHT THAT SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE POLICY IS VITAL FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. STRATEGIES THAT RELY ON LARGE SCALE SPENDING OR EVEN THE USE OF SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY FORCE IN ISOLATION ARE UNLIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THE MOST PROMISING APPROACHES ARE CULTURALLY INTELLIGIBLE AND CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE NON-STATE JUSTICE NETWORKS OF AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY TO COLLECTIVELY ADVANCE THE JUDICIAL STATE BUILDING PROCESS. WHILE THE CASE STUDIES FOCUS ON POST-CONFLICT STATES, THE THEORY PRESENTED CAN HELP UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AS WELL AS GOOD GOVERNANCE AND DEVELOPMENT MORE BROADLY IN ALL LEGALLY PLURALIST SETTINGS.
712	KORNAI'S EARLIER WORKS EMBODIED THE IDEA THAT STATE INSTITUTIONS FORMED A SYSTEM WITH A STRONG TENDENCY TO REPRODUCE ITSELF, AND HENCE TO RESIST MINOR REFORMS. THUS, AT THE END OF SOCIALISM, HUGE CHANGES WERE NEEDED IN POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND THE LAW TO BUILD A NEW SYSTEM ORIENTED TOWARDS THE MARKET-TYPE ECONOMY, WHICH WOULD AGAIN BE STABLE, SELF-REINFORCING AND SELF-SUSTAINING. TRANSITION PROMOTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW STATES IN EASTERN EUROPE THAT CONFORMED TO THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA FOR THE EU ACCESSION. WERE WE TOO HASTY IN THINKING THAT WE HAD SUCCEEDED? THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE NOT RETURNING TO THE PREVIOUS ONE, AND ONLY IN A FEW AREAS HAVE THE BASIC NORMS OF A MARKET-TYPE ECONOMY BEEN SET ASIDE IN HUNGARY OR POLAND. BUT CONCERNS ARISE AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN POLITICS, LAW AND ECONOMICS - TO DO WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE NATURE AND ROLE OF THE STATE, AND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARLIAMENT, THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY. UNAVOIDABLY, THERE IS ALSO AN INTERESTING INTERNATIONAL DIMENSION HERE, REPRESENTED BY THE SHIFT FROM THE WARSAW PACT AND CMEA TO NATO AND THE EU. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THESE ISSUES IN THE LIGHT OF SOME OF KORNAI'S RECENT ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENTS IN HUNGARY, WHILE ALSO DRAWING ON HIS VERY INSIGHTFUL EARLIER WORKS.
713	IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER IS PUT IN QUESTION THE PRESENT-DAY DOMINANT ITALIAN IDEOLOGY OF THE SO CALLED 'NEW CONSTITUTIONALISM', WHICH CONSIDERS HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN OPEN-TEXTURE CATALOGUE OF CLAIMS WHICH ONLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS (AND MORE GENERALLY JUSTICES) ARE ENTITLED TO INTERPRET AND IMPLEMENT. THIS IDEOLOGY IS CONSIDERED AS A TOOL FOR OVERCOMING THE TRADITIONAL LIBERAL RULE OF LAW (RECHTSSTAAT) IN FAVOR A OF MORE AND MORE DEVELOPED RULE OF THE COURTS (RICHTERSSTAAT).
714	THIS ARTICLE INITIALLY ANALYSES THE THEORETICAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE TERMS << RULE OF LAW >> AND << HUMAN RIGHTS >> IN THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU) CAN BE ANALYSED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW (EAL). IT THEN FOCUSES ON THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING DECISION-MAKING TO APPRECIATE, UNDER THAT PERSPECTIVE, THE CHOICES MADE BY STATES, BOTH AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL (WHICH COULD ALSO INCLUDE THE COMMITMENT TO THE SDGS). FROM THERE, THE STUDY IS ORIENTED MORE TOWARDS SDG 16 PROPOSING, SUMMARILY, TO DENOMINATE WITH THE TERMS << HORIZONTAL >> AND << VERTICAL >> TWO DIFFERENT BASIC PERCEPTIONS ON ITS THREE MAIN AREAS (PEACE, JUSTICE, AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS) AND TENTATIVELY UNCOVERING THEIR POSSIBLE IMPACTS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF SPECIFIC GROUPS (E.G., LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY, IMMIGRANTS, REFUGEES, ETC.). IT IS SUGGESTED THAT, WHILE THE << HORIZONTAL PERCEPTION >> PRESENTS A SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE ROLE, THE << VERTICAL PERCEPTION >> TENDS TO BE MORE EXCLUSIONARY. SEEKING CONGRUENCE WITH THE ABOVE, IT IS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT A BIASED PERCEPTION OF SDG 16 (ASSOCIATED WITH THE << VERTICAL >> VISION) COULD HELP AUTHORITARIAN STATES IN THE EXALTATION OF THEIR NATIONALISM, WITHOUT FORGETTING THAT INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC ORDER, OFTEN WIELDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, CAN SERVE AS A << DEFENSIVE SHIELD >> AGAINST ALLEGED << ATTEMPTS TO ALTER >> THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF THE STATE AND OF THE CHRISTIAN ROOTS OF THEIR SOCIETIES. SIMULTANEOUSLY, OBSERVATION OF EVERYDAY POLITICAL LIFE SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC ORDER CAN BE ALTERED TO THE LIKING OF POPULIST POLITICAL PARTIES. THE RESULT SEEMS TO REVEAL A GROWING DICHOTOMY BETWEEN VALUES (EUROPEAN VS. NATIONAL), PUBLIC ORDERS (EUROPEAN, ALBEIT INCIPIENT VS. INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC), AND TYPES OF DEMOCRACY (LIBERAL VS. ILLIBERAL). AS INCIDENTAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES, THE AUTHORITARIAN DRIFTS IN HUNGARY AND POLAND ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY.
715	IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS, CHINA HAS BEEN TRYING TO ADOPT THE VALUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS LEGISLATION, JUSTICE AND ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER, CHINA'S EFFORTS WERE NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE EXPOSED SEVERE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION. THE EVENTS IN CHINA ALWAYS DRAW THE EYES OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND THE CRITIQUES AND PRESSURE FROM WESTERN WORLD MAKE CHINA RESPOND AND TRANSFORM ITSELF. THE CRITIQUES ARE MAINLY ON THE ONE-CHILD POLICY, TIBETAN PROBLEM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. TO DIFFERENT PROBLEMS, CHINA ALSO RESPONDS IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
716	THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO SHOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW IS THE RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO LIBERTY IN SOLIDARITY. THE METHOD USED IS SPECIFIC OF LEGAL RESEARCH; IN THIS CASE THROUGH ARGUMENTATION AND BY SHOWING THE IMPORTANCE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES HAVE ON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE STUDY OPENS WITH AN INTRODUCTION WHERE THE MATTER IS PUT FORWARD, FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND A COMMENT ON THE INCIDENCE OF THE SOCIAL STATE CLAUSE ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THAT HERALDS THE MAIN CONCLUSION: THAT GENERAL INTEREST IN A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW IS FULLY CONNECTED TO THE PROMOTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL, INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN BEINGS IS CENTRAL AND AT THE ROOT OF PUBLIC LAW, WHEREBY ALL ITS INSTITUTIONS AND CATEGORIES SHOULD BE DEFINED AND BUILT FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE.
717	MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF DE FACTO MILITARY RULE THROUGH THE ARMED FORCES (SPECIAL POWERS) ACT (AFSPA) 1958 IN INDIA'S NORTHEAST HAS ENGENDERED NEITHER STABILITY NOR PEACE. PROBLEMS REGARDING THE IMPUNITY OF VIOLENCE AND CRIME, OFFICIAL CORRUPTION AND THE VIRTUAL COLLAPSE OF THE RULE OF LAW CONTINUE, BUT THE ACT REMAINS IN OPERATION. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO REFRAME THE DEBATES ON THE AFSPA IN TERMS OF ITS NECESSITY BY TURNING THE NECESSITY ARGUMENT ON ITS HEAD AND ARGUING THAT THE SECESSIONIST INSURGENCIES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY USED TO JUSTIFY THE ACT HAVE ACTUALLY LONG CEASED TO EXIST. SINCE THE PRINCIPLE OF EXISTENTIAL NECESSITY THAT PROVIDED A FIG LEAF TO THE ACT NO LONGER APPLIES, ITS CONTINUED APPLICATION NEEDS TO BE RE-EXAMINED. IT IS FURTHER ARGUED THAT THE INDIAN MILITARY'S INCREASING CLOUT IN INTERNAL SECURITY POLICY-MAKING MAY HAVE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR INDIAN DEMOCRACY ITSELF, WITH NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND IN RELATION TO SAFE INCLUSION STRATEGIES FOR INDIA'S NORTHEAST.
718	INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE GLOBAL ARTICULATION OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND PEREMPTORY NORMS OUTLAWING CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, AN INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION OF STATES TO PURSUE INDIVIDUALS WHO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS FORMALIZED. SINCE THE 1999 INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM, TIMOR-LESTE HAS STRUGGLED TO ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE FOR THE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS COMMITTED DURING INDONESIA'S 25-YEAR DE FACTO ADMINISTRATION. TIMOR-LESTE PROVIDES A UNIQUE CASE STUDY ON THE INTERNATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF PURSUING JUSTICE IN A POST-CONFLICT TRANSITIONAL CONTEXT, PARTICULARLY AS MANY ALLEGED PERPETRATORS OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN SHIELDED BY INDONESIA. THIS PRESENTS A CHALLENGE FOR TIMOR-LESTE IN BALANCING ITS VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC PRIORITIES: WHILE DOMESTIC POLITICAL ORDER AND RULE OF LAW NECESSITATES THE PURSUIT OF SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE, TIMOR-LESTE'S EXTERNAL SECURITY INTERESTS REQUIRE A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH INDONESIA. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WORLD'S FIRST BILATERAL TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION, THE INDONESIA-TIMOR-LESTE COMMISSION OF TRUTH AND FRIENDSHIP. IT THEN ANALYSES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS BY INDONESIA AND TIMOR-LESTE. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE COMMISSION WAS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL MECHANISM DESIGNED TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL PRIORITIES RATHER THAN SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE.
719	GLOCAL (GLOBAL TO LOCAL) ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE LAGS BEHIND THE SCIENCE REGARDING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE COMBINED ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL CHALLENGES. GOVERNANCE REGIMES HAVE DEVELOPED DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT ISSUE AREAS AND ARE OFTEN INCONSISTENT AND CONTRADICTORY; FURTHERMORE GOVERNANCE INNOVATIONS IN EACH AREA LEAD TO NEW CHALLENGES. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF ISSUE-BASED, PLURAL, AND FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE RAISES KEY NORMATIVE QUESTIONS IN ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. HENCE, THIS OVERVIEW PAPER AIMS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: HOW CAN THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY MOVE TOWARDS A MORE NORMATIVELY CONSISTENT GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT? IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, I FIRST EXAMINE THE KEY NORMATIVE ISSUES AND THE NATURE OF GOVERNANCE IN THE AREA OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WATER AND FORESTS. IN DOING SO I ALSO LOOK AT THE IMPLICATIONS OF EACH FOR FOOD PRODUCTION, SAFETY AND SECURITY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT (A) THERE ARE STRONG NORMATIVE AND ARCHITECTURAL INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FRAGMENTED AND PLURAL ISSUE-SPECIFIC REGIMES; (B) THAT SUCH INCONSISTENCIES ARE INEVITABLE IN AN 'ANARCHIC' INTERNATIONAL ORDER; (C) THAT SOME DEGREE OF NORMATIVE COHERENCE CAN BE STRIVED AT THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW; AND (D) THAT THE PRESENT DISCUSSION ON GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS CREATING A NORMATIVELY CONSISTENT GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.
720	ALONG WITH THE TRADITION OF CELEBRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHARTER OF 1215, THERE IS A LONG TRADITION OF SKEPTICISM CONCERNING ITS PURPOSE (WHICH WAS NOT TO ACHIEVE RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT BUT TO PRESERVE THE PROPERTY OF WEALTHY LANDOWNERS), ITS FORCE (IT WAS ANNULLED BY THE POPE AND REPUDIATED BY THE KING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS), AND EVEN ITS SUCCESS AS A PEACE TREATY (WAR BROKE OUT WITHIN A FEW MONTHS). THE AUTHOR WILL OUTLINE THE REASONS FOR SKEPTICISM, BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY SEE WHAT THERE IS TO CELEBRATE IN 2015, IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHARTER OF 1215 WAS THE FAILED RESULT OF A REACTIONARY ARMED TAX REBELLION BY WEALTHY AND POWERFUL LANDOWNERS, WHO WERE NOT TRYING TO MAKE A NEW CONSTITUTION. WHAT IS THERE TO CELEBRATE? THE AUTHOR WILL ADDRESS THAT QUESTION BY ASKING WHY THE CHARTER OF 1215 WAS NEITHER VOID (AS THE POPE ASSERTED) FOR REPUGNANCY TO THE KING'S AUTHORITY, NOR VOIDABLE FOR DURESS. THE AUTHOR CHALLENGES THE IDEA THAT THE CHARTER OF 1215 IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ENGLAND, ARGUING THAT THE RULE OF LAW GOES BACK FARTHER, AND THAT THE CHARTER OF 1215 WAS VERY LIMITED IN ITS IMPACT. BUT IT DID PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN TWO WAYS: BY GIVING NEW SPECIFICITY TO LEGAL DUTIES AND RESTRICTIONS THAT THE KING HAD ALREADY BEEN SUBJECT TO, AND BY HIGHLIGHTING THE COUNTRY'S NEED FOR EFFECTIVE PROCESSES FOR GIVING EFFECT TO THOSE DUTIES AND RESTRICTIONS.
721	INCREASING GEOPOLITICAL RISKS AND DETERIORATED INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY COULD BE AN IMPORTANT OBSTACLE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY IS AIMED TO EXAMINE THE LONG RUN IMPACTS OF GEOPOLITICAL RISK AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS (FDI) IN BRICS COUNTRIES DURING 1992-2019 WITH USING DYNAMIC PANEL DATA ESTIMATORS. ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS, INCREASING GEOPOLITICAL RISK HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FDI INFLOWS WHILE IMPROVEMENTS IN RULE OF LAW AND EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FDI INFLOWS. BESIDES, LONG RUN ELASTICITY FINDINGS REVEALED THAT DEVELOPMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAVE A RELATIVELY A STRONG IMPACT ON FDI COMPARED WITH THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF INCREASING GEOPOLITICAL RISKS.
722	THE PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE ADOPTION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE APPLY PLS-SEM ON A SAMPLE OF 33 COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO TEST THE POTENTIAL CAUSAL EFFECT OF THREE GOVERNANCE CONSTRUCTS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF THE WORLD BANK'S WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS. WE FIND THAT THE DIMENSION THAT INCLUDES GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND REGULATION QUALITY ACTS AS THE MAIN DISINCENTIVE FOR CITIZENS TO USE CRYPTOCURRENCIES. ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCT THAT COMPRISES POLITICAL STABILITY AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS NEGATIVE TOO, ITS SIZE IS SMALLER. THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, SINCE THEY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ADOPT CRYPTOCURRENCIES. THIS REVEALS THAT A SOLID WELFARE STATE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FACTOR IN DISSUADING CITIZENS FROM USING THOSE DIGITAL ASSETS, WHILE HIGH-QUALITY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FINANCIAL CHECKS THAT USUALLY APPLY TO ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS ENCOURAGE THE ADOPTION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

723	PUBLIC BUREAUCRACIES SHAPE THE VALUES OF THEIR OFFICIALS IN WAYS THAT AFFECT PERFORMANCE AND BEHAVIOUR. BY CONTRASTING THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE VALUES IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG AND HOW THEY IMPACT ON SUCH ISSUES AS ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE ORGANISATION, SUPERIOR-SUBORDINATE RELATIONSHIPS, CONFLICT AND CONFLICT AVOIDANCE AND RESPONSIVENESS TO CHANGE, THE CHARACTER OF THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE DYNAMICS OF INTERACTIONS WITHIN IT CAN BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD. FROM THE FINDINGS, THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF DIFFERENCES IS THAT THE PREVAILING CONCEPTION ON THE MAINLAND IS OF A BUREAUCRACY WHERE AUTHORITY IS LODGED IN THE PERSON ("RULE OF MAN"), WHEREAS IN HONG KONG, WEBERIAN BUREAUCRACY ("RULE OF LAW") IS THE DOMINANT FORM. THE STUDY DRAWS BOTH ON QUANTITATIVE MATERIAL DERIVED FROM THE SAME SURVEY CONDUCTED AMONG SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS ON THE MAINLAND AND IN HONG KONG AND ON QUALITATIVE MATERIAL FROM INTERVIEWS WITH OFFICIALS.
724	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE THE INTERFERENCE OF POLITICAL MORALISM IN THE BRAZILIAN INSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC SPHERE. FIRST THE TEXT DESCRIBES WHAT MEANS TO SAY THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM HAS A MORAL CONTENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE PAPER ANALYSES THE IMPACTS OF MORALISM IN THE ACTIVIST PERFORMANCE OF THE JUDICIARY, AND IN THE SUBJECTIVIST PERFORMANCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. IN THIS RESPECT, IT CRITICIZES THE ABANDONMENT OF LEGAL RATIONALITY DUE TO A MORAL PERSPECTIVE, EXPLAINING WHY THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION OF 1988. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PROFILE OF BRAZILIAN CIVIL SOCIETY, ALSO STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY A SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF MORALITY THAT IS NOT SUITABLE TO THE POSTULATES OF PUBLIC LIFE. THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEA OF THE RESEARCH IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN BRAZIL THERE IS A REPLACEMENT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BY AN INAPPROPRIATE MORALITY (AND HOW THIS SITUATION PRESENTS AN OFFENSE TO A GENUINE RULE OF LAW). THE TEXT DESCRIBES THE DANGERS OF POLITICAL MORALISM. IN CONCLUSION, DEFEND THE RIGHT LAID DOWN IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF 1988 AS THE OBJECTIVE FOUNDATION OF ACHIEVING JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY.
725	IN THIS ARTICLE, IT INTENDS DISCUSSING THE ELEMENTS THAT INVOLVE INVOLVE THE RAWLSIAN CONCEPTION OF RIGHT PRESENT IN JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS. TO THIS END, THE TEXT IS RAISED AS FOLLOWS: IN THE FIRST PART, IT EXPLORES THE SYSTEM OF RIGHTS THAT THE AUTHOR FORMULATES, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A DEFINITION OF RIGHT, AS WELL AS FORMULATING A TYPOLOGY OF RIGHTS; IN THE SECOND PART, IT ARGUES THE LEGAL SYSTEM THAT JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS REQUIRES, CHARACTERIZING THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF LAW AND PUNISHMENT IN A WELL-ORDERED SOCIETY; FINALLY, IN THE THIRD PART, IT DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE RIGHTS SYSTEM, POINTING TO THE WAY IN WHICH RIGHTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED TO UNDERTAKE A GRAMMAR OF RIGHTS IN JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS.
726	TO SOME, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN AN ABSTRACT PROMISE, TO OTHERS, IT IS A RATHER CONSERVATIVE STUMBLING BLOCK, AND OFTEN, IT IS A TAKEN FOR GRANTED INGREDIENT OF MODERN SOCIETIES, NOT MUCH CARED FOR, NEITHER LOOKED AFTER. YET TODAY, LAW IS GRABBED BY PEOPLE WHO PLAN TO ABUSE IT, IN UTTER DISREGARD OF THE JUSTICE DEMANDS THAT INFORM THE VERY IDEA. IN HUNGARY, POLAND AND TURKEY, THE COURTS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO REFORM, STREAMLINING THEM INTO SERVANTS OF THE POLITICAL REGIME. IN GERMANY, RIGHT WING POLITICS PRESENT THEMSELVES AS THE TRUE DEFENDERS OF THE RECHTSSTAAT, YET USE IT TO FRAME MORE OR LESS EVIDENTLY RACIST ATTACKS ON REFUGEES AND OTHERS SUFFICIENTLY OTHERED. ALSO, NEO-FASCIST SPOKESPEOPLE ON US AND UK CAMPUSES AND BEYOND PRESENT THEMSELVES AS COMMITTED TO FREE SPEECH AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM, YET ABUSE BOTH IN ATTACKS ON THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE AS WELL AS EDUCATION THAT DESERVES ITS NAME. IN LIGHT OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS, THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND CONSTITUTIONALISM, AS THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES THAT DESERVE THE NAME.
727	COURTS ARE BECOMING MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THIS NEW TREND WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THAILAND. OUR STUDY PRIMARILY ANALYZES THE BEHAVIOR OF THE THAI CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DURING THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN 2006-2008; THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RECENT JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND ASSERTIVENESS IN POLITICAL MATTERS, WHILE PARTLY EXPLAINED BY THE INTERESTS OF JUDGES THEMSELVES AND BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES GUIDING THEIR ACTIVITIES, IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE INTERVENTION OF THE MONARCHY, TO WHICH THE JUDICIARY HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CLOSELY ALIGNED. ACCORDINGLY, THE THAI CASE NOT ONLY PROVIDES NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT MAY BE DRIVING THE NEW JUDICIALIZATION TREND, IT ALSO DRAWS ATTENTION TO PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF THIS TREND, NAMELY THE GRADUAL POLITICIZATION OF THE THAI JUDICIARY AND WITH IT THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THAILAND AND ITS REPLACEMENT WITH RULE BY LAW. OUR FINDINGS MAY ALSO ILLUMINATE SOME LARGER ISSUES AT THE INTERSECTION OF POLITICS AND THE COURTS THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN WAYS THAT ADVANCE THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH.
728	IN THIS ARTICLE, JAMES HARPER OF LEXISNEXIS UK OUTLINES THE COMPANY'S BI-CENTENARY, AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE 'RULE OF LAW'. THE ARTICLE WILL DESCRIBE THE FASCINATING DEVELOPMENT OF UK LAW DURING THIS PERIOD, FOCUSING ON KEY MILESTONES IN ARGUABLY THE LARGEST AND MOST EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LAW THE WORLD HAS SEEN. IT WILL ALSO OUTLINE THE RANGE OF LEGAL INDUSTRY INNOVATIONS WHICH LEXISNEXIS AND ITS COMPANIES HAVE SPEARHEADED OVER THE YEARS.
729	BUILDING ON RECENT WORKS SHOWING THE ROLE THAT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS CAN PLAY IN ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND DRAWING ON INSIGHTS OBTAINED FROM POWELL AND RICKARD (INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS 36: 335-362, 2010), WE DEMONSTRATE THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH COMMON LAW LEGAL SYSTEMS ATTRACT GREATER PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT THAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CIVIL LAW OR ISLAMIC LEGAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE COMMON LAW SYSTEMS ARE MORE INCLINED TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CAN BE UNDERSTOOD TO PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENCY IN THE LAW, BETTER CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, MORE JUDICIAL AUTONOMY AND MORE MARKET-ORIENTED REGULATIONS. WE BASE OUR FINDINGS ON AN ANALYSIS OF TIME-SERIES PANEL DATA FOR 99 COUNTRIES COVERING THE PERIOD 1980-2007.
730	THE RELATION BETWEEN THE THREAT TO RULE OF LAW IN INDIA AND ITS POORLY DRAFTED LEGISLATION MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS AT FIRST. AND YET CLEAR, INTELLIGIBLE LAWS HAVE BEEN THE PREMISE FOR THE SUCCESS OF RULE OF LAW. THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH DONE IN THE FIELD OF PLAIN LANGUAGE LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING IN INDIA. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THREE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF PLAIN LANGUAGE DRAFTING IN NINE INDIAN STATUTES PASSED IN THE LAST DECADE. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: ARRANGEMENT OF PROVISIONS, MARGINAL NOTES, AND SENTENCE STRUCTURE. EACH OF THE SELECTED NINE STATUTES IMPACTS THE RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE GROUPS. THUS, THE NEED TO MAKE THESE STATUTES COMPREHENSIBLE BY DRAFTING THEM IN PLAIN ENGLISH IS IMPORTANT. BY SUGGESTING WAYS TO SIMPLIFY THE LANGUAGE OF THE NINE STATUTES, THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT THESE PLAIN LANGUAGE DRAFTING TECHNIQUES MUST BE ADOPTED BY INDIAN LEGISLATIVE DRAFTERS.
731	TORTURE IS AN OLD "LEGAL INSTITUTION" - WE ARE TOLD BY LEGAL HISTORIANS-. HOWEVER, MODERNITY IN THE LAW CONSISTS IN EXPELLING IT FROM THE PRECINCT OF WHAT IS LEGALLY CONCEIVABLE AND PERMITTED. THIS "ACTIO FINIUM REGUNDORUM" OF THE LEGAL SPHERE, WHERE RADICAL CRUELTY IS NOT ALLOWED, HAS RECENTLY AND UNFORTUNATELY BEGUN TO BE CHALLENGED AND BE MUCH LESS OBVIOUS, BOTH IN THEORY AND, HELAS, IN PRACTICE. NOW, SOMETIMES LAW IS AGAIN AND OPENLY RECONNECTED WITH VIOLENCE AND EVIL. EVIL - WE ARE INSTRUCTED - WILL BE COMPENSATED AND PAYED BACK WITH EVIL. ILLEGAL TERROR IS FOUGHT BACK WITH LEGAL TERROR. IN ANY CASE TORTURE IS A LESSER EVIL. THIS ARTICLE WOULD LIKE TO SHORTLY INTRODUCE TO THIS NOVEL DRAMA AND TO CONSIDER WHETHER REHEARSING IT AS IN THE "GOOD" OLD TIMES WHERE TORMENT WAS JUST ANOTHER STEP OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL OR OF AN EFFECTIVE "RAISOND'ETAT" COULD BE FITTING OUR STILL WIDESPREAD SELF-UNDERSTANDING OF LAWYERS AS BEING PART AND ACTORS WITHIN A LIBERAL CULTURE. COULD IT REALLY BE THE CASE THAT "STATE OF EXCEPTION" IS THE HARD CORE OF OUR RULE OF LAW?
732	POLITICAL RULE DEPENDS UPON PUBLIC DISCOURSE AS IT REQUIRES NEGOTIATION AND COMPROMISE OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS. PUBLIC DISCOURSE INCLUDES ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS CAUSE LAWYERING, LOBBYING, AND RULE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE RULE OF LAW SUPPORTS PUBLIC DISCOURSE THROUGH, INTER ALIA, THE RIGHT TO PETITION. THE RIGHT TO PETITION REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE ENGAGED IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE THROUGH PETITION. THIS REQUIREMENT REFLECTS A PRINCIPLE OF GENERAL APPLICATION. SOLICITORS OWE AN ETHICAL DUTY TO SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO PETITION. LAWYERS WITHOUT A SPECIFIC DUTY TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW HAVE ETHICAL DUTIES TO MAINTAIN THE REPUTATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THEIR LEGAL PROFESSION. LAWYERS, INCLUDING SOLICITORS, ARE FREQUENT CONTRIBUTORS TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE. LAWYERS SOMETIMES RESIST IDENTIFYING THE CLIENTS OR CLIENT GROUPS THEY REPRESENT IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE ON THE GROUND OF THE NEED TO PROTECT CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. THIS RESISTANCE IS NOT ETHICALLY WELL REASONED, AND LAWYERS SHOULD RECOGNISE A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THE IDENTITY OF A CLIENT OR CLIENT GROUP FOR WHOM THE LAWYER IS MAKING REPRESENTATIONS IN ANY PUBLIC ARENA, UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC ARENA TO INCLUDE BOTH REPRESENTATIONS TO PUBLIC OFFICE HOLDERS (LOBBYING) AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO REFORM CAMPAIGNS OR CONSULTATIONS (CAUSE LAWYERING OR RULE ENTREPRENEURSHIP).
733	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE CREDIT GROWTH OF MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS) IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (SSA). THIS PAPER USES A PANEL DATASET OF 131 MFIS ACROSS 31 SSA COUNTRIES SPANNING 2004-2018 AND APPLIES THE ARELLANO-BOVER/BLUNDELL-BOND TWO-STEP GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) WINDMEIJER BIAS-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS TO ESTIMATE THE PARAMETERS. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CREDIT GROWTH OF MFIS. WE UNCOVER NEW AND INTERESTING EVIDENCE THAT POLITICAL STABILITY "SANDS THE WHEELS" OF CREDIT GROWTH OF MFIS, IMPLYING THAT MFIS OPERATING IN MORE POLITICALLY STABLE COUNTRIES TEND TO BE MORE RISK AVERSE AND LIMIT CREDIT SUPPLY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RULE OF LAW "GREASES THE WHEELS" OF CREDIT GROWTH OF MFIS, SUGGESTING THAT MFIS EXPAND CREDITS MORE WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS STRONGER. WE ALSO UNCOVER THAT CREDIT GROWTH IS LINKED TO REGULATORY QUALITY/GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS POSITIVELY, BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SIMILARLY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON MFI CREDIT GROWTH. THE FINDINGS HAVE SEVERAL USEFUL IMPLICATIONS AS DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER.
734	THIS WORK DEALS WITH THE RECENT CASE-LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION REGARDING THE GUARANTEE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN POLAND, DEVOTING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE LATEST JUDGMENT OF THE COURT, MIASTO LOWICZ ET. ALT. (26TH MARCH 2020). MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHOR ANALYSES HOW JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 2 AND 19 TUE, MIGHT BE THREATENED BY RECENT LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY POLISH INSTITUTIONS.
735	THE STATE OF LAW AND THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW ARE TWO STATE MODELS THAT ARE CLOSELY LINKED BECAUSE OF THE VARIOUS PRINCIPLES, OBJECTIVES AND CONFIGURATIVE ELEMENTS THAT THEY SHARE. HOWEVER, BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS THERE ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENCES THAT WILL ARISE DUE TO THE HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES THAT LED TO A WAVE OF SOCIAL DEMANDS THAT COULD NOT BE SATISFIED BY THE RULE OF LAW, SEEING AS NECESSARY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW STATE MODEL THAT WILL MANAGE TO SOLVE THE DEMANDS OF THE TIME, EMERGING THE SOCIAL STATE OF LAW.
736	BEFORE NEOLIBERALISM BECAME GLOBAL, IT WAS AN INTELLECTUAL PROJECT THAT HAD A PARTICULAR VIEW OF THE POWER OF CONSTITUTIONS TO LIMIT SOVEREIGN STATES, ANCHOR ECONOMIC FREEDOMS AND PROTECT MARKETS FROM DEMOCRATIC PRESSURES FOR GREATER EQUALITY. IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD, NEOLIBERALISM HAS LONG BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS. HOWEVER, THE COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF ITS LEGAL FOUNDATIONS AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IS STILL AN AREA OF LIMITED SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO ADVANCE IN THAT DIRECTION. BY EXAMINING THE WORK OF FRIEDRICH A. HAYEK, MILTON FRIEDMAN AND JAMES M. BUCHANAN, IT EXPLORES A THEORY OF NEOLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM WITHIN CHILE, THE SO-CALLED FIRST NEOLIBERAL LABORATORY. THESE AUTHORS VISITED THE COUNTRY DURING THE PINOCHET DICTATORSHIP (1973-90), AND WERE CONNECTED WITH TOP CHILEAN AUTHORITIES AS PART OF THEIR GLOBAL AMBITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THEIR THEORETICAL AGENDAS IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHILE'S CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS BETWEEN 1973 AND 1980 OFFERED AN ON-SITE EXPERIMENT IN INTRODUCING NEOLIBERAL'S RADICAL ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. IT ADDRESSES HOW THE DICTATORSHIP'S NATURAL LAW-BASED RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES WERE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEOLIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL IDEOLOGY BY SUPPORTING A DISTINCTIVE VIEW OF THE STATE'S ROLE AND DESIGNING THE INNOVATIVE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE THE MARKET'S PRIORITY IN THE STRUCTURAL AND RIGHTS DIMENSION OF THE 1980 CONSTITUTION. IN THE WAKE OF CHILE'S RECENT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AGENDA, THIS ARTICLE NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EXISTING DEBATE BY REFLECTING ON THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE STILL-PERSISTENT CONSTITUTIONAL NEOLIBERAL FEATURES, BUT ALSO WORKS AS A CASE STUDY FOR EVALUATING NEW GLOBAL TURNS TOWARDS AUTHORITARIAN NEOLIBERAL POLITICS.
737	THIS ARTICLE CHARTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF SHIFTING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. IT IDENTIFIES THE EXPRESSED HOPES THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE GRAVEST CRIMES WILL BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND CONSIDERS THE INITIAL SUCCESSES OF THE COURT. IT ALSO ADDRESSES WHAT MAY BE FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESSES WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. TO THE QUESTION POSED, AN ANSWER MAY BE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT REMAINS A REVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION BUT LACKS THE POWER AND JURISDICTION TO SUCCEED IN ITS MAIN GOAL; THE PROVISION OF JUSTICE FOR ALL VICTIMS OF THE GRAVEST CRIMES KNOWN TO HUMANITY.
738	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER GREEN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT AID (ODA) HAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MITIGATING CARBON EMISSIONS IN RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, AND IF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY MATTERS FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GREEN ODA. FOR 86 GREEN ODA RECIPIENT COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2003-2014, WE EXPLORE THE NEXUS BETWEEN GREEN ODA, INSTITUTIONS AND CARBON EMISSIONS. BY USING A TWO-STEP SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT (GMM), WE FIND THAT GREEN ODA OVERALL HAS NO DIRECT ASSOCIATION WITH THE MITIGATION OF CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, WHEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICES ARE INCLUDED, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GREEN ODA. IN GENERAL, GREEN ODA IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CARBON EMISSIONS IN COUNTRIES WITH POOR INSTITUTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, GREEN ODA IS EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING CARBON EMISSIONS WHEN CHANNELED TO COUNTRIES THAT ENJOY HIGHER ECONOMIC FREEDOM AS WELL AS MORE FREEDOM FROM CORRUPTION. RESULTS ARE MIXED FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
739	THIS ARTICLE TENDS TO GIVE AN INSIGHT ON THE HISTORICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF ALBANIA, ON THE NEED OF THE SOCIETY AND THE HISTORICAL CHANGES THAT LED TO ITS CREATION. IT FOCUSES ESPECIALLY ON THE ROLE AND COMPETENCES OF THIS COURT ON THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, ON THE BALANCING AND DIVISION OF POWERS, ON THE PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF INDIVIDUALS. ITS AIM IS TO PROVIDE OVERALL INFORMATION ON THE FUNCTIONING AND STANDARDS IT FOLLOWS. IT IS BASED ON THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THIS COURT DURING THE YEARS AND IS ENRICHED BY ITS DECISIONS ON PARTICULAR SUBJECTS AND COMPARES THIS COURT TO OTHER SIMILAR ONES IN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE IS MAINLY DIRECTED TO SCHOLARS AND LEGAL WRITERS WHOSE AIM IS TO COMPARE THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF ALBANIA TO OTHER SIMILAR COURTS.
740	THE REPUBBLIKA JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE INTRODUCED THE NEW PRINCIPLE OF "NON-REGRESSION" INTO THE SYSTEM OF EU LAW. THIS PRINCIPLE IS BOUND TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE UNION. THE COURT WAS ASKED TO ASSESS WHETHER THE MALTESE SYSTEM FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES WAS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AS ENSHRINED IN ARTS 19(1) TEU AND 47 OF THE CHARTER. WHEREAS THE COURT CONFIRMED AND DEVELOPED ITS RECENT CASE LAW ON THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES, WE ARGUE THAT THE JUDGMENT WILL BE REMEMBERED MOSTLY FOR THE NEW PRINCIPLE, WHICH WAS NOT EVEN INDISPENSABLE FOR SOLVING THE CASE. IN A NOVEL APPROACH, THE GRAND CHAMBER READ ARTS 49 TEU AND 2 TEU AS OBLIGING THE MEMBER STATES TO ENSURE THE NATIONAL NON-REGRESSION IN THE FIELD OF EU VALUES. ACCORDING TO THE COURT, THE UNION IS COMPOSED OF STATES THAT HAVE FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY ACCEDED TO THE UNION, WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO ENSURE THAT ANY REGRESSION OF THE PROTECTION OF THE FOUNDING VALUES IS PREVENTED. THE NEW PRINCIPLE MAY BROADEN THE REACH OF EU RULE OF LAW OBLIGATIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BEYOND THE VITAL ASPECTS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ACTIVATED VIA ART.19(1) TEU IN PORTUGUESE JUDGES AND PROVIDE A SEMINAL NEW APPROACH TO TACKLING THE SO-CALLED "COPENHAGEN DILEMMA": THE UNION'S INABILITY TO ENFORCE THE FOUNDING VALUES AFTER ACCESSION. "NON-REGRESSION" IS THUS A SIGN OF MASSIVE RETHINKING OF THE POTENTIAL LIMITS OF EU COMPETENCE. AS SUCH, THE REPUBBLIKA JUDGMENT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE PROTECTION OF EU VALUES AND MARKS A FUNDAMENTAL LEAP FORWARD IN THIS REGARD.
741	THE CHINESE LEGISLATOR HAS DESIGNED A COMPLEX REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO REGULATE THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BUILD A NEW MODEL OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE CAPABLE OF INTEGRATING THE POLITICAL, LEGAL, INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, FINANCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL CREDIT SECTORS. EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT DEVELOPING AN INCREASINGLY TRUSTWORTHY AND SECURE AI, THE FOUNDATION OF AN INTELLIGENT RULE OF LAW. THE INTELLIGENTIZATION OF JUSTICE OPERATES ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF DATABASES, THE REGULATION OF THE TELEMATIC PROCESS, THE CREATION OF MOBILE MICRO COURTS AND INTERNET COURTS, AND GOES AS FAR AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AI-ASSISTED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THIS PROCESS OF INTELLIGENTIZATION IS NOT ONLY A TECHNICAL TOOL TO MAKE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT MORE EFFICIENT BUT ALSO A RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF THE JUDICIAL RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM. WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS A NEW PARADIGM OF DIGITAL JUSTICE, WHICH IS DECLINED ACCORDING TO THE FEATURES OF CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE.
742	ALL LAW REFORM MUST LOOK FOR LOCAL PRECEDENTS TO BUILD ON. DOES THIS CLAIM ALSO APPLY TO FORMERLY TOTALITARIAN STATES? BUILDING ON HER RESEARCH ON EAST GERMAN LEGAL HISTORY, THE AUTHOR ASKS WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE SOME GENERALLY APPLICABLE REASONS EXPLAINING WHY IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THE FIRST TENDER SHOOTS OF A RULE OF LAW APPEARED BEFORE THE COLLAPSE OF SOCIALISM. SHE FINDS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL AND LEGAL FAITH: AS ONE DECLINES, THE OTHER RISES, AND VICE VERSA. THE WANING OF UTOPIAN HOPES TENDS TO BE COMPENSATED FOR BY AN INCREASED INTEREST IN LAW AND RIGHTS AND BY THE GROWING PROFESSIONALISM OF A DISENCHANTED LEGAL CLASS. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT NOT ONLY IS THE "PREROGATIVE STATE" A CONSTANT THREAT TO THE "NORMATIVE STATE," BUT THAT, VICE VERSA, THE PRACTICE OF LEGALITY, EVEN THE LEGALITY OF TOTALITARIAN STATE, CAN THREATEN AND UNDERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOCRATIC RULE.
743	WHAT DRIVES REGULATEES' BEHAVIORS WHEN THE INSTITUTION OF LAW IS WEAK? THIS STUDY SEEKS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BY EXAMINING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION ENFORCEMENT IN CHINA. BASED ON SURVEY AND INTERVIEW DATA ON HONG KONG-OWNED MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES IN THE PEARL RIVER DELTA REGION, GUANGDONG PROVINCE, WE FOUND THAT THEIR DECISIONS TO ADOPT BASIC AND PROACTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE LESS DRIVEN BY CONCERNS FOR LEGALITY THAN BY THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE REGULATORS' ACTIONS AND GESTURES. ENTERPRISES ADOPTED BASIC ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES TO AVOID POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT AND MORE PROACTIVE PRACTICES TO AVOID POTENTIALLY ARBITRARY IMPOSITIONS FROM REGULATORY OFFICIALS. REGULATED ENTERPRISES WERE MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT BOTH BASIC AND PROACTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES IF THEY HAD LESS DIFFICULTIES IN UNDERSTANDING THE ENFORCED REGULATIONS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST IMPORTANT WAYS IN WHICH REGULATORY COMPLIANCE BEHAVIORS IN A DEVELOPMENTAL CONTEXT MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE IN WESTERN COUNTRIES.
744	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNPACK AND APPROPRIATELY SEPARATE THE CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE. THE IMPETUS FOR THIS RESEARCH COMES FROM THE ONGOING AND EXPANDING CONVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND GOVERNANCE BY ACADEMICS, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND POLICYMAKERS. ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AREAS OF RESEARCH THAT IS AFFECTED BY THIS CONVOLUTION ARGUES THAT DEMOCRACIES GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW AND PROVIDE SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONS WHICH CONSIDERABLY INFLUENCE NOT ONLY DEVELOPING STATES' OVERALL DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORIES, BUT ALSO MULTINATIONAL FIRMS' DECISIONS ON WHERE TO DO BUSINESS. I ARGUE THAT THESE SUPERIOR INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND QUALITY BUREAUCRACY, ARE SEPARATE FROM THE INSTITUTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND CONSTITUTE THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE. MOREOVER, IT IS THE INSTITUTIONS THAT COMPRISE GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NOT THE INSTITUTIONS OF DEMOCRACY THAT ARE KEY INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF DEVELOPING STATES' ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, ONLY BY APPROPRIATELY CONCEPTUALIZING GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE, AS IS DONE IN THIS ARTICLE, AND SEPARATING IT THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY FROM DEMOCRACY WILL SCHOLARS AND POLICYMAKERS MOVE FORWARD IN UNDERSTANDING THE DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
745	THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN RULE OF LAW IN INDIA, REFLECTED IN THE FREQUENT AMENDMENTS TO THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE HISTORICAL, IDEOLOGICAL, AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR THE DETERIORATION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN INDIA. I ARGUE THAT THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS OF SOCIALIST PLANNING WERE FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION. THIS INCOMPATIBILITY LED TO FREQUENT AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. CONSEQUENTLY, PURSUIT OF SOCIALIST POLICIES GRADUALLY UNDERMINED THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONTRADICTORY MIXTURE OF SOCIALISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM LED TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEPRIVATIONS THAT WERE NEVER INTENDED BY THE FRAMERS. I DEMONSTRATE THIS INCOMPATIBILITY USING EVIDENCE FROM FIVE-YEAR-PLANS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN INDIA.
746	THE POLITICAL ECONOMY LITERATURE INVESTIGATES THE DETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) BASED LARGELY ON AGGREGATE DATA, IGNORING THE ACTUAL DECISION MAKERS. THE AUTHORS CONDUCT A SURVEY OF U.S. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS-THE ACTUAL DECISION MAKERS-OF CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE INVESTMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA TO UNDERSTAND FDI INFLOWS. THE AUTHORS FIND THAT INVESTMENT RISK RELATED TO PROPERTY-RIGHTS PROTECTION, ADHERENCE TO RULE OF LAW, AND AN EFFECTIVE COURT SYSTEM WEIGHED MOST HEAVILY IN U.S. FIRM PREFERENCES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RATHER THAN STRESS DEMOCRACY ITSELF AS A DETERMINING FACTOR, RESEARCHERS MIGHT BETTER FOCUS ON THE INSTITUTIONS FOUND WITHIN DEMOCRACIES.
747	THE PUBLIC POLICY EXCEPTION IS A NOTORIOUS PART OF CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE. THE EXCEPTION ALLOWS COURTS TO REFUSE TO APPLY FOREIGN LAW SELECTED BY FIRST-ORDER CHOICE OF LAW RULES THAT VIOLATES THE FORUM'S FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY AND JUSTICE. AS A DOCTRINAL MATTER, PUBLIC POLICY IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED PART OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF CHOICE OF LAW. BUT SCHOLARS HAVE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT SHOULD BE PART OF CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE, GIVEN THE NORMATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE FIELD; HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL AND NON-FUNDAMENTAL NORMS THAT INFORM ITS USE; AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE LEADING PUBLIC POLICY CASES IN A COHERENT WAY. IN THIS ARTICLE, I OFFER A SOLUTION TO THESE THREE PROBLEMS. I ARGUE WE SHOULD RECONCEPTUALIZE THE EXCEPTION AS A MEANS BY WHICH COURTS CAN ANALYZE THE SUBSTANCE OF FOREIGN LAW TO ENSURE THAT IT COMPLIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND THUS CAN BE APPLIED 'AS A LAW' IN THE FORUM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, PUBLIC POLICY IS HOW COMMON LAW COURTS ENSURE THAT ANY FOREIGN LAW THEY APPLY COMPLIES WITH THE DISTINCTIVE SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION - WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE COMMON LAW CONSTITUTION. PUBLIC POLICY THUS DEFINES THE FRONTIERS OF LEGALITY IN THE COMMON LAW TRADITION, AND DEFENDS AGAINST THREATS FROM THE RULE OF LAW THAT COME FROM BEYOND THE BORDER. THIS APPROACH JUSTIFIES THE INCLUSION OF THE EXCEPTION IN CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINE, GIVEN THE FIELD'S OTHER NORMATIVE COMMITMENTS. IT CAN ALSO HELP DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL AND NON-FUNDAMENTAL NORMS THAT SHOULD DEFINE THE AMBIT OF PUBLIC POLICY. FINALLY, THIS APPROACH MAY OFFER A COHERENT ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTRINE, AS NUMEROUS LEADING CASES CAN BE REINTERPRETED TO TRACK THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY THAT INHERE IN THE COMMON LAW CONSTITUTION.
748	INSTITUTIONS GENERATE INCENTIVES THAT GUIDE BEHAVIOR, BUT MANY ANALYSTS AND POLICYMAKERS UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF INSTITUTIONS TO AFFECT BEHAVIOR BY IGNORING HOW DISTINCT STRATEGIES WORK TO GENERATE SIMILAR OUTCOMES IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS. THIS ARTICLE USES THE ILLEGAL TRADE IN PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES TO ILLUSTRATE HOW OUTCOMES (THE SIZE OF THE ILLEGAL DRUG MARKET) ACROSS VERY DISTINCT POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS CAN BE THE SAME BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ADOPT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE SAME BEHAVIOR: TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE. THE ILLEGAL TRADE IN PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES REPRESENTS AN UNDERSTUDIED AND POORLY STUDIED ISSUE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. ARGUMENTS THAT FOCUS ON THE DEVIANT CHARACTERISTICS OF GOVERNMENTS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD AND ORGANIZED CRIME TO EXPLAIN THE TRADE ARE MISLEADING FOR EMPIRICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL REASONS. I PROPOSE A GENERAL ARGUMENT ABOUT THE PROLIFERATION OF THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ITS SUCCESS IN COUNTRIES STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY, CORRUPTION, TERRORISM, AND PARIAH LEADERS, AS WELL AS IN RICH, STABLE DEMOCRACIES IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW "REIGNS." THE ARTICLE TAKES FACTORS THAT ARE OFTEN SEEN AS DISTINCT IN EXPLAINING THE DRUG TRADE (E.G., CIVIL RIGHTS IN LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES AND CORRUPTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES) AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THEIR EXPLANATORY LOGIC REPRESENTS VARIATIONS ON THE SAME CAUSAL VARIABLE: THE ABILITY TO CONCEAL ONESELF. MY INSIGHT IS THAT THE STRATEGIES USED TO ACHIEVE CONCEALMENT VARY BY THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS FIND THEMSELVES.
749	THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ECOLOGICAL RULE OF LAW, MAXIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, ASKS FOR A PARADIGM SHIFT FROM THE CURRENT CARTESIAN FRAGMENTATION TO A SYSTEMIC AND COMPLEX VIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, AS WELL AS ADEQUATE AND EFFECTIVE PROCEDURAL INSTRUMENTS. THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF JURISDICTIONAL ACTION IS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF SUFFICIENTLY DEALING WITH COMPLEX CONFLICTS, THAT IS, THOSE THAT PUT MULTIPLE SOCIAL INTERESTS ON A COLLISION COURSE, ALL OF WHICH ARE WORTHY OF PROTECTION AND ARE THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTES. THE CONCEPT OF STRUCTURAL PROCESS EMERGES, UNDERSTOOD AS ONE THAT AIMS TO IMPLEMENT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, CARRY OUT/RESTRUCTURE A PARTICULAR PUBLIC POLICY AND/OR RESOLVE COMPLEX DISPUTES. IN PROCESSES LIKE THESE, THE PRECEPT ORDINARILY INDICATES A RESULT TO BE ACHIEVED AND THE WAY TO ACHIEVE IT (CASCADE DECISIONS). THE RESEARCH INTENDS TO DISCUSS HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE USE OF THE STRUCTURAL PROCESS MODEL ENHANCES THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, CONTRIBUTING TO THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ECOLOGICAL RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE STRUCTURAL PUBLIC CIVIL ACTION OF LAGOA DA CONCEI & CCEDIL;& ATILDE;O, IN THE CITY OF FLORIAN & OACUTE;POLIS, IN THE STATE OF SANTA CATARINA, IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL. IN ORDER TO DO SO, EXPLORATORY AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WAS USED, WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SOURCES AND, THROUGH THE INDUCTIVE METHOD, IT CARRIED OUT THE STUDY OF THE STRUCTURAL PUBLIC CIVIL ACTION OF LAGOA DA CONCEI & CCEDIL;& ATILDE;O, WITH THE SCOPE OF ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ECOLOGICAL RULE OF LAW, ECOLOGICAL GOVERNANCE AND JUSTICE.
750	COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM VIOLENT CONFLICT MUST OVERCOME SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVE LONG-LASTING PEACE. THE LITERATURE PAINTS A BLEAK PICTURE INDICATING THAT ONLY FEW POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES IMPROVE IN TERMS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. INSTEAD, THEY MIGHT EXPERIENCE EVEN MORE CORRUPTION, BECAUSE STATE STRUCTURES ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED WHILE INFORMAL NETWORKS HAVE FLOURISHED DURING THE CIVIL WAR. YET, WE KNOW SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO CORRUPTION DURING CONFLICT. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE WHETHER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION IN POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM PRE-WAR LEVELS. USING DATA FROM THE VARIETIES OF DEMOCRACY (V-DEM) PROJECT, WE FIND THAT CORRUPTION IS RELATIVELY STABLE OVER TIME. HOWEVER, LONGER AND MORE INTENSE CONFLICTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CORRUPTION.
751	CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CONSTITUENTS OF A RULEOF-LAW STATE. WITHOUT A PROFESSIONAL AND INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE MECHANISM, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION AS THE FOUNDATIONAL LAW WITH THE HIGHEST LEGAL EFFECT. MODERN VIETNAM IS BUILT AROUND THE SOVIET MODE OF POWER ORGANIZATION; THEREFORE, THERE ARE MANY INHERENT DIFFICULTIES IN BUILDING AND OPERATING A PROFESSIONAL AND INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE. AS A RESULT OF THE 2013 CONSTITUTION AND THE 2015 LAW ON REFERENDUM, THE OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED, RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT, AND PROFESSIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE MODEL IN VIETNAM HAS NEVER BEEN MORE POSSIBLE THAN IT IS NOW. BY APPLYING CERTAIN MAIN RESEARCH METHODS SUCH AS THE NORMATIVE ANALYSIS AND COMPARATIVE METHODS, THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO CLARIFY THE OPPORTUNITIES AND ANALYSE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIETNAMESE CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE MECHANISM CONCERNING UNIVERSAL STANDARDS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT PROPOSES A CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENCE MODEL FOR A SOCIALIST RULE-OF-LAW STATE.
752	THE PRESENT ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SCOPE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF NON BIS IN IDEM AS A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF THE RULE OF LAW, IUS PUNIENDI LIMITED TO THE STATE, AND ENSURING ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS RELATED TO DUE PROCESS. ITS DEFINITION, ANALYSIS AND DESIGN IS LINKED NOT ONLY WITH THE RULES OF LAW, BUT ALSO SUPRANATIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS, REQUIRING THEIR MANDATORY COMPLIANCE BY ALL ENTITIES OF THE STATE.
753	THIS ARTICLE INQUIRES INTO WHAT THE GOSPEL OF PEACE MIGHT MEAN FOR CHRISTIAN THEOLOGICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SETS A PROVISIONAL AGENDA FOR PEACE ETHICS IN AN AGE OF GLOBAL RISKS. TWO WARNINGS ARE SOUNDED WITH RESPECT TO THE LANGUAGE OF 'PEACE ETHICS' AND 'THE RULE OF LAW'. THREE PRIORITIES ARE IDENTIFIED: (I) THINKING WITH AND ABOUT THE GLOBAL POOR IN WAYS THAT DO NOT RENDER 'THE OTHER' SOMEHOW DIFFERENT FROM MYSELF; (II) RETRIEVAL OF THE TWIN IDEAS OF 'NATURALNESS' AND DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE IN NATURAL LAW REASONING AS THEY BEAR UPON INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE USE OF FORCE; (III) HOW TO CONCEIVE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMON GOOD BY CONSIDERING 'PEACE THROUGH LAW' AS A POTENTIALLY SUBVERSIVE ENDEAVOUR WHEN EMPLOYED IN THE SERVICE OF THE GLOBAL POOR.
754	WESTERN LAW IS A BUNDLE OF SYSTEMATIC, COMPREHENSIVE RULES BASED ON, FIRST, MODERN WESTERN STATES' LEGAL SYSTEMS; SECOND, CONSTITUTIONALISM BASED ON LIBERAL DEMOCRACY; THIRD, CAPITALIST MARKET ECONOMIES BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM; FOURTH, THE ROMAN LAW TRADITION; AND, FIFTH, CHRISTIAN ETHICS. BY CONTRAST, IN MANY CASES, NON-WESTERN LAW HAS NO ELABORATE OR SOLID STRUCTURE BASED ON A SPECIAL MECHANISM, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR-CUT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CLEARLY DEMARK THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN LAWFULNESS AND UNLAWFULNESS; RATHER, IT IS FLEXIBLE. NON-WESTERN LAW IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS CUSTOMARY LAW, AND OTHER SUCH NAMES. THUS, "LAW," AS USED IN THE SENSE OF NON-WESTERN LAW, IS A CULTURAL HYBRID, AND THUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY UNDERSTAND NON-WESTERN LAW BY USING THE STANDARDS FOR LAWFULNESS AND UNLAWFULNESS EMPLOYED IN THE STUDY OF WESTERN LAW. IN THIS PAPER, I WILL FOCUS ON THE CHINESE-STYLE OF THE "RULE OF LAW" THROUGH ANALYZING AND CLASSIFYING VIEWS ON "RULE OF LAW" IN CHINESE LEGAL ACADEMIC CIRCLES AND DISCUSS THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE "IDENTITY POSTULATE OF A LEGAL CULTURE" IN ASIAN LAW IN THE FACE OF GLOBALIZATION BY DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM CAUSED BY BLENDING WESTERN LAW WITH NON-WESTERN LAW.
755	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE LINK BETWEEN SECESSION AND CONSTITUTIONALISM AMONG ADVANCED CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE CLASSIC PARADIGM, IDENTIFIED WITH US CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND THE SO CALLED NEW PARADIGM, IDENTIFIED WITH CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM. WHILE THE CLASSIC APPROACH IS REPRESENTED BY A HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION THAT PROHIBITS SECESSION (INCLUDING A REFERENDUM ON SECESSION), THE NEW PARADIGM ATTEMPTS TO ACCOMMODATE PRO-INDEPENDENCE DEMANDS IF THERE IS A CLEAR MAJORITY ASKING FOR IT. TODAY, DIFFERENT LEGAL ORDERS FROM EUROPEAN DEMOCRATIC STATES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO RESPOND TO THIS TYPE OF DEMANDS. BRITISH CONSTITUTIONALISM, FOR INSTANCE, WHEN DEALING WITH SCOTTISH DEMANDS FOR INDEPENDENCE, HAS FOLLOWED THE NEW PARADIGM, ALLOWING FOR THE SECESSION REFERENDUM TO TAKE PLACE IN A GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED PART OF THE COUNTRY, ALTHOUGH WITH CERTAIN SUPERVISION BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND EXCLUDING A UNILATERAL RIGHT TO SECEDE OR EVEN TO ORGANIZE AN INDEPENDENCE REFERENDUM. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, HOWEVER, THE POSITION OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE. IN THIS SENSE, SPAIN IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RELEVANT EXAMPLE, YET IT IS NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE. IN EFFECT, RECENT DECISIONS OF THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS CONFIRM THIS INTERPRETATION, ALTHOUGH WITH NUANCED DIFFERENCES. IN ALL THESE CASES, THE COURTS HAVE NOTED THAT SOVEREIGNTY BELONGS TO THE (NATIONAL) PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AND THAT A SEGMENT OF SUCH PEOPLE CANNOT MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES WHEN THEY DO AFFECT THE WHOLE OF THE CITIZENSHIP. THESE COMMON POSITIONS SHOW THAT THE NEW PARADIGM HAS NOT REPLACED THE CLASSIC APPROACH, BUT THAT BOTH ARE EQUALLY VALID FOR ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES. FURTHERMORE, THIS ARTICLE ALSO ATTEMPTS TO UNDERLINE THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH APPROACHES TO SECESSION (CLASSIC AND NEW PARADIGM), THERE ARE SOME COMMON TRAITS: RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND KEY ROLE FOR THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH EXCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY TYPE OF UNILATERAL SECESSION.
756	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES WHETHER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) DECISIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY STATE OWNERSHIP. THE LITERATURE HAS ESTABLISHED THAT HOST COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS AFFECT FDI ALLOCATION, BUT THERE IS NO SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE HOW STATE OWNERSHIP AFFECTS SUCH RELATIONSHIPS. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THAT STATE OWNERSHIP SYSTEMATICALLY AFFECTS THE RELATION BETWEEN HOST COUNTRY INSTITUTIONS AND FDI. THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS INDICATE THAT STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) SHOULD INVEST RELATIVELY MORE THAN PRIVATELY OWNED ENTERPRISES (POES) IN COUNTRIES WITH POOR RULE OF LAW, POOR PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION AND A HIGH DEGREE OF CORRUPTION. HOWEVER, SOES ARE EXPECTED TO INVEST RELATIVELY LESS THAN POES IN DICTATORSHIPS AND COUNTRIES WITH POOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. WE TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, USING A NEW DATASET ON NORWEGIAN FIRMS' FDI FROM 1998 TO 2006. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT SOES INVEST RELATIVELY MORE THAN POES IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGH LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND WEAK RULE OF LAW. INDEED, SOES' FDI APPEARS NOT TO BE REDUCED BY SUCH INSTITUTIONAL RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO SOLID EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT SOES INVEST MORE IN DEMOCRACIES AND COUNTRIES WITH BETTER HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION.
757	FINLAND PROMOTED A VALUE-BASED AGENDA AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COUNCIL IN 2019. THE FOCUS WAS ESPECIALLY ON THE DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. A ROLE AS A STRONG VALUE PROMOTER DEPARTS FROM THE PRAGMATIC AND CAUTIOUS TRADITION OF FINNISH EU POLICY. IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL ASK WHY FINLAND CHOSE TO PROMOTE VALUES, AND WHAT KIND OF POLITICAL DEBATE PRECEDED ITS PRESIDENCY TERM. SECOND, I WILL LOOK AT THE ACTUAL PROMOTION OF THE COMMON VALUES DURING THE PRESIDENCY. THIRD, I WILL PROVIDE SOME EVALUATIONS OF THE SUCCESS OF FINLAND'S VALUE-BASED APPROACH. THE ANALYSIS DRAWS FROM COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTARY SOURCES RELATED TO FINNISH EU POLICY AND HER PRESIDENCY TERM, AND FROM 33 SEMI-STRUCTURED RESEARCH INTERVIEWS AMONG THE KEY FINNISH POLITICIANS, CIVIL SERVANTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES IN 2020. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT VALUES WERE THOROUGHLY DEBATED BEFORE THE TERM AND THEIR RELEVANCE INCREASED AS THE PRESIDENCY APPROACHED. FINLAND ALSO SUCCEEDED IN PROMOTING SEVERAL VALUES, ESPECIALLY BY LINKING THEM TO PRACTICAL QUESTIONS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EVALUATING THE SUCCESS OF FINLAND'S APPROACH IS MORE CONTENTIOUS, WHICH MAY BE TACKLED SEVERAL WAYS.
758	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE TENOR OF THE ENDURING DEBATE ON THE UNITED KINGDOM'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULING OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) IN HIRST V UNITED KINGDOM (NO. 2) [2005] ECTHR 74025/01. DISCUSSION OF THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF PRISONERS HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY PARLIAMENTARY RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE WITH THE NEXUS BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS, AND A STRONG TENDENCY FOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECTHR TO SPILL OVER INTO RECKLESS DENIGRATION OF THE LEGAL SPHERE AS A WHOLE. AS SUCH, THE TONE OF DEBATE ON THIS HIGH-PROFILE ISSUE IS LIABLE TO ERODE MUTUAL RESPECT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COURTS, AND TO DIMINISH THE PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. IN A NATION WITH AN UNCODIFIED CONSTITUTION, THE EFFECT OF SUCH EROSION SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED. THE TRUE DANGER OF THE HIRST DEBATE, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS, IS THAT CONTINUED NON-COMPLIANCE WILL ENTRENCH MISTRUST OF LAW, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE JUDICIARY, THEREBY ALLOWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRASBOURG COURT NOT ONLY TO UNDERMINE THE UK'S INTERNATIONAL STANDING, BUT ALSO TO DESTABILISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE CLOSER TO HOME.
759	THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION, UTILIZING THE HAUSMAN AND TAYLOR'S TECHNIQUE TO ESTIMATE A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL THAT INCORPORATES BOTH THE EFFECTS OF CORRUPTION DETERMINANTS THAT VARY OVER TIME AND THOSE THAT ARE TIME-INVARIANT, AND USING A LARGER PANEL DATASET AND A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF CORRUPTION DETERMINANTS. THE FIRST INTERESTING RESULT IS THAT PERCEPTION OF STRONG SUPPORT FOR RULE OF LAW IS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH REDUCED CORRUPTION, SUGGESTING THAT A BETTER QUALITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT REDUCES CORRUPTION. RICH COUNTRIES HAVE LOWER CORRUPTION, AND THE PERCEPTION OF FREE EXPRESSION AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRONGLY DECREASES CORRUPTION, INDICATING THAT PROVIDING GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN SELECTING THEIR GOVERNMENT, MORE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND FREE MEDIA ARE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF CURBING CORRUPTION. CONVERSELY, NATURAL RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, COUNTRY POPULATION SIZE, COUNTRY'S DOMINANT RELIGIOUS TRADITION, ETHNIC FRACTIONALIZATION, AND POLITICAL STABILITY ARE UNIMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF CORRUPTION, WHILE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THEY ARE IMPORTANT.
760	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES TWO DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ISSUED LAST YEAR AGAINST HUNGARY, WITH THE AIM OF OUTLINING A NEW TREND IN THE COURT'S CASELAW, WHERE THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW ARE CONFRONTED WITHOUT MAKING EXPRESS REFERENCE TO IT. THE PROFILES OF THE TWO JUDGEMENTS THAT ARE INVESTIGATED ARE THREE, AND NAMELY THE TIMING OF THE PROCEDURES, THE ROLE OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE ASSESSMENT OF VIOLATIONS OF THE TFEU RULES ON THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL AND SERVICES, THE ASSESSMENT OF VIOLATIONS OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ALONGSIDE TFEU VIOLATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO PROVE THAT THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE UNDER ART. 258 TFEU CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO HINDER ANTIDEMOCRATIC DRIFTS AND ILLIBERAL TRENDS EVEN WHEN A CASE IS DESIGNED AS PURELY TECHNICAL AND THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT CALLED IN, WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY SHIELD THE COURT ITSELF FROM ACCUSATIONS OF BEING TOO POLITICALLY INVOLVED IN MEMBER STATES' AFFAIRS.
761	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO FIND WHETHER GOVERNANCE CONTRIBUTES TO POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WERE EXAMINED IN 111 HIGH- AND LOW-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (HIDC AND LIDC) BETWEEN 1996 AND 2018 TO DETERMINE WHICH, IF ANY INDICATORS, HAVE A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE PER CAPITA GDP, AND THEREFORE THE ECONOMY. WE USE FIXED EFFECTS AND PERFORM THREE DIFFERENT REGRESSIONS IN OUR ANALYSIS. ONE FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE THEN ANOTHER TWO REGRESSIONS, ONE FOR HIDC AND ONE FOR LIDC. WE FIND THAT TWO GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' GDP PER CAPITA WHERE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY HAD A SMALL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON DEVELOPING COUNTIES' GDP PER CAPITA. WE FIND THAT CONTROLLING FOR CORRUPTION AND ACCOUNTING FOR RULE OF LAW IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMICS. WITHIN THE EXISTING LITERATURE, THERE IS NEITHER A THEORETICAL CONSENSUS NOR CONSISTENT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THE RELATIONSHIP IS POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NON-EXISTENT, FOR LOW- AND HIGH-INCOME DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE FIND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY EXACERBATE PER CAPITA INCOME IN LIDC, WHILE IT HELPS PROMOTE HIGHER PER CAPITA INCOME IN HIDC.
762	THE WESTERN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW AND STATE OF A FREE SECULAR STATE IS ESSENTIALLY BASED ON KANT'S VIEW OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED UNDISPUTED. DESPITE ALL EMPIRICALLY PROVEN INADEQUACY: IS THERE AN ALTERNATIVE? NEITHER MERE LEGAL POSITIVISM - WHICH SAYS THAT RIGHT APPLIES AND IS JUST, BECAUSE AND AS SOON AS IT IS SET - HAS NOT PROVEN ITSELF IN HISTORY. THE QUESTION OF "JUSTICE OF THE LAW" MUST BE ASKED AND REQUIRES PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION ON THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LAW AND MORALITY. IT CAN BE ANSWERED WITH THE HELP OF A "METAPHYSICS OF MORALS", AS FORMULATED BY KANT. THE PECULIARITY OF KANT'S THEORY OF THE STATE IS THEN BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A PART OF HIS ETHICS. AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF FREEDOM, WHICH MUST BE THOUGHT OF AS INNER - FREEDOM OF MAN - AND OUTER - CIVIL LIBERTY - CAN, LIKE THE CONCEPTS OF DUTY AND LAW, SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION OF A "MORAL POLICY".
763	THE ARTICLE ENGAGES IN AN IDEOLOGY CRITIQUE OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL-LAW TEXTS AND DISCOURSE, DRAWING ON A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK DEVELOPED BY CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES SCHOLARS IN ORDER TO INTERROGATE, IN A DIFFERENT JURISPRUDENTIAL CONTEXT, THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERGIRDING CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL-LAW (ICL) SCHOLARSHIP. IT ARGUES THAT THE TRIUMPHALISM SURROUNDING ICL AND ITS ADEQUACY TO DEAL WITH CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE IGNORES THE FACTORS AND FORCES - INCLUDING SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INTERVENTIONS IN COUNTRIES' POLITICAL ECONOMIES - THAT SHAPE OR EVEN HELP ESTABLISH THE ENVIRONMENT FROM WHICH SUCH CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE EMANATE. IN UNCRITICALLY CELEBRATING ICL AND EQUATING IT WITH A PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, ICL SCHOLARSHIP RISKS SHAPING PASSIVE ACQUIESCENCE IN THE STATUS QUO AND DISCOURAGING MORE THROUGHGOING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC FORCES UNDERLYING INSTANCES OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING POLITICAL-ECONOMIC FORCES SHAPED BY INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS.
764	THE CURRENT ARTICLE HAS AS ITS MAIN OBJECT THE ROLE OF PUBLIC ADVOCACY IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION, INTENDING TO DEMONSTRATE THE GUARANTEE NATURE OF THIS PRINCIPLE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STRUCTURING PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE OF LAW. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE, THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES WILL BE PURSUED: A) ANALYZING DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE OF LAW ' S HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT UNTIL ITS CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION; B) ANALYZING PUBLIC ADVOCACY'S HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTIONS ON RULE OF LAW; C) DEMONSTRATING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ADOPTING THE DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE OF LAW AS A STRUCTURING PRINCIPLE OF THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION, CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER ASPECTS, ITS INFLUENCE ON REALIZATION OF HUMAN ' S DIGNITY. FROM METHODOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, A DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED, HAVING THESE MAIN SOURCES: BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION, NATIONAL LAW AND DOCTRINE PRODUCED BY GREAT THINKERS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, WHICH INTENDS TO BRING TO LIGHT SOME CONSENSUS AND DIVERGENCES REGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC ADVOCACY FOR CONCRETIZATION OF THE STRUCTURING PRINCIPLES. BY THE END, THE AUTHOR'S CONSIDERATIONS WILL BE PRESENTED, IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GUARANTEE OF STRUCTURING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, THROUGH AN ADEQUATE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF PUBLIC ADVOCACY.
765	CHARISMATIC LEGITIMATION THEORY EMERGED IN THE 1960S AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING THE RISE OF PERSONAL LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE THEORY FITTED IN QUITE WELL WITH THE ROLES THAT POST-INDEPENDENCE LEADERS WHO HAD BUILT LARGE FOLLOWERSHIP IN THE STRUGGLES FOR INDEPENDENCE WERE EXPECTED TO PLAY IN NATION BUILDING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE FAILURE TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARISMATIC LEGITIMATION INTO PERSONALITY CULTS AND UNACCOUNTABLE AUTHORITARIAN RULE HAS HOWEVER LED TO CRITICAL REVIEWS OF THE THEORY. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE THEORY IN THE LIGHT OF THE NIGERIAN EXPERIENCE AND ARGUES THAT GIVEN THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY'S ELITE EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LEADERSHIP CANNOT BE LEFT TO THE PREFERENCES AND CHOICES OF LEADERS NO MATTER HOW EXEMPLARY, MESSIANIC, HEROIC, OR REVOLUTIONARY THEY MAY BE. THE ARTICLE MAKES A CASE FOR INSTALLING THE REQUISITE INSTITUTIONAL CORRELATES THAT ARE CONSONANT WITH DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CAPABLE OF RESTRAINING THE TENDENCIES TOWARDS THE PERSONALISATION OF POLITICAL POWER.
766	THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES ITS MEMBER STATES TO FULFIL THEIR COMMITMENTS STEMMING FROM THE MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU RESPONSIBLY AND TO ASSIST IN CARRYING OUT TASKS FLOWING FROM THE TREATIES AND TO ACHIEVE THE UNION ' S OBJECTIVES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF SINCERE COOPERATION. THIS SCIENTIFIC THESIS POINTS OUT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MEMBER STATES TO FULFIL THEIR OBLIGATIONS IN BONA FIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRINCIPLE PACTA SUNT SERVANDA AND IT REFERS TO WELL ESTABLISHED CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU CLARIFYING THE APPLICATION PRIMACY OF EU LAW OVER NATIONAL LAWS. AT THE SAME TIME IT OPENS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT DECISIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS RELATED TO THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW IN SOME EU MEMBER STATES, IN PARTICULAR IN GERMANY AND POLAND. THIS SCIENTIFIC THESIS POINTS OUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EU LAW IN THE PROCESS OF FURTHER DEEPENING OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND PROMOTING RULE OF LAW VALUES COMMON TO THE EU MEMBER STATES.
767	PROPERTY RIGHT ADVOCATES WELCOMED THE SUPREME COURT'S 1992 DECISION IN LUCAS V. SOUTH CAROLINA COASTAL COUNCIL. JUSTICE SCALIA'S OPINION FOR THE COURT ESTABLISHED A CATEGORICAL TAKING WHEN ALL ECONOMIC VALUE IS LOST AS A RESULT OF REGULATION. ADVOCATES OF UNCONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE REGULATION WERE QUICK TO SUGGEST (WISHFULLY) THAT LUCAS'S IMPACTS WOULD BE MINIMAL SINCE MOST REGULATIONS DO NOT DESTROY ALL ECONOMIC VALUE. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER, SOME WHO SAW ONLY DARK CLOUDS ON THE REGULATORY HORIZON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF LUCAS NOW SEE A RAINBOW WITH A POT OF GOLD AT ITS END THIS NEWLY OPTIMISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF LUCAS STEMS FROM JUSTICE SCALIA'S REFERENCE TO "BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES" OF COMMON LAW NUISANCE AND PROPERTY. THESE BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES SERVE NOT ONLY AS AN EXCEPTION IN CATEGORICAL TAKINGS, BUT ALSO AS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE THAT IMMUNIZES GOVERNMENT FROM VIRTUALLY ALL TAKINGS CLAIMS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT THERE IS NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY IN JUSTICE SCALIA'S STATEMENT THAT BACKGROUND PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMON LAW ARE RELEVANT TO THE DEFINITION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS. WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IS THE CLAIM THAT, CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORIC EVOLUTION OF THE COMMON LAW, THESE PRINCIPLES ARE ALMOST INFINITELY MALLEABLE IN THE HANDS OF COURTS AND LEGISLATURES. IT IS THIS CLAIM THAT CREATES THE DECEPTION OF A POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE LUCAS RAINBOW, AND IT REFLECTS A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMON LAW PROCESS, A DISTORTION OF JUSTICE SCALIA'S MEANING IN LUCAS, AND DISREGARD FOR THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TAKINGS CLAUSE.
768	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE THE CONCEPTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY PREVAILING AMONG SOCIAL WORKERS IN LISBON THROUGH A QUALITATIVE-TYPE STUDY. THIS DEPARTS FROM ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPTS OF HUMANITY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS GUARANTEES FOR EXERCISING SOCIAL WORK IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN DIGNITY AS A HISTORICAL, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONSTRUCT. THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA COLLECTED BY INTERVIEWS DEMONSTRATES THAT SOCIAL WORKERS, WHILE NOT HAVING A DEEP-REACHING CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS THEME, PRIORITIZE A KANTIAN CONCEPTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY, PERCEIVING THIS AS AN ABSOLUTE VALUE.
769	"DEVELOPED" STATES TEND TO REFLECT THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH "LESS DEVELOPED" STATES, ENCOURAGING REPLICATION OF THEIR OWN SOLUTIONS AND PROCESSES. THIS IS "RECURSIVE" LAW AND DEVELOPMENT (LAD). THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF SINGAPORE IN LAD PROCESSES IN THE ASEAN REGION. IT FINDS THAT SINGAPORE'S LAD EFFORTS ARE RECURSIVE AND FOCUSED ON RULE-OF-LAW AND GOVERNANCE TRAINING, INCLUDING ESPECIALLY ANTI-CORRUPTION METHODS. THESE ARE CONDUCTED NOT VIA A SPECIAL AGENCY, BUT VIA CO-OPERATION THAT IS MULTILEVEL, MULTIDIMENSIONAL, AND UNTRUMPETED. LAD CAN LEARN LESSONS FROM THIS APPROACH.
770	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW THE ENACTMENT OF REGULATIONS AND LAWS DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE INFLUENCES CO2 EMISSIONS. USING A SAMPLE OF 83 COUNTRIES AND COVERING THE PERIOD FROM 2003 TO 2014, OUR DYNAMIC PANEL ANALYSIS YIELDS TWO MAJOR RESULTS. FIRST, THE ENACTMENT OF NEW CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS (I.E., AMENDMENTS, DECREES, ORDERS) ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG RULE OF LAW SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHES CO2 EMISSIONS. THIS RESULT VALIDATES THE HYPOTHESIS OF GUNNINGHAM (J ENVIRON LAW 23:169-201, 2011. 10.1093/JEL/EQR006), WHICH ARGUES THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION MUST BE SUPPORTED BY REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN EFFICIENTLY ENFORCE THE LAW. SECOND, THE ENACTMENT OF NEW CLIMATE CHANGE LAWS SEEMS TO NOT IMPACT EMISSIONS LEVELS INDEPENDENTLY OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT PRIVATE AGENTS ANTICIPATE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE NEW LAW(S) AND MUST CONSEQUENTLY ADAPT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH LAWS, LEADING TO A NONSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CO2 EMISSIONS.
771	DURING THE EUROPEAN LEGISLATURES 2009-2014 AND 2014-2019 THE EU HAS WITNESSED THE CHALLENGE POSED BY THE ALARMING SIGNS OF DETERIORATION AND DECLINE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE EU. NOT BY CHANCE THIS TREND HAS COINCIDED WITH THE IMMERSION OF THE UNION IN THE WORST CRISIS IN ITS HISTORY THAT BEGAN IN 2008 AND HAS BEEN CALLED THE "GREAT RECESSION" OF THE EU OR THE EUROPEAN "GLACIATION". OVER THIS PERIOD HUNGARY HAS BEEN THE BEST EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN THE EU BUT POLAND HAS SHOWN AN EQUALLY WORRYING DETERIORATION LATELY. YET THESE ARE NOT, UNFORTUNATELY, ISOLATED CASES BUT THERE IS RATHER AN INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD TREND IN EUROPE THAT HAS RECEIVED, DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT, THE NAME "PUTINIZATION" OR "ORBANIZATION". THE PRESENT ARTICLE RECOUNTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DETERIORATION EXPERIENCED BY THOSE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN LAUNCHED FROM THE EU TO FOLLOW-UP AND CONTEST THOSE PROCESSES. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE "ANTI-LIBERAL" OR "ILIBERAL " FEATURES THAT CHARACTERIZE THESE DEMOCRACIES AS WELL AS THOSE MARKS INHERENT TO THE RISE OF NATIONALISM AND INTOLERANCE AND PUTS THEM IN RELATION TO OTHER HISTORICAL PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIC EROSION IN EUROPE, FOCUSING ON THE DIALECTIC DEMOCRACY VS POPULISM. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXPOSES THE CONFLICTS STEMMING FROM THE SO-CALLED "COPENHAGEN DILEMMA" AND THE RISE OF THE EXTREME RIGHT ACROSS THE EU AND STOPS IN SOME CONCRETE CASES SUCH AS THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF REFUGEES IN DENMARK OR THE LIMITATIONS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS IN THE FIELD OF CIVIL LIBERTIES IN SPAIN. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THIS DETERIORATION IS LINKED TO THE " GREAT ENLARGEMENT ", WHICH INVOLVED THE ACCESSION TO THE EU OF THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A RELENTLESS FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT RAPIDLY BECAME IN A SOCIAL CRISIS AND A TRULY CRISIS OF VALUES AS A RESULT OF THE AUSTERITY POLICIES IMPOSED BY AN UNSATISFACTORY HANDLING OF THE CRISIS ITSELF. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A CHALLENGE TO THE VERY IDEA OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION COMING FROM DIFFERENT IDEOLOGICAL FRONTS. THE ARTICLE FINALLY STOPS ON THE EUROPEAN RESPONSE TO THE DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING DESCRIBED BEFORE BY REAFFIRMING ITS FUNDAMENTAL VALUES AND BY ENHANCING THEIR PROTECTION BY IMPLEMENTING NEW MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU IS IMPROVED COMPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS LEGAL COMMON TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITIONS OF THE EU MEMBER STATES.
772	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF CAUSE LAWYERS IN CONFLICTED OR AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXTS WHERE THE CHANCES OF LEGAL VICTORY ARE OFTEN MINIMAL. DRAWING UPON THE LITERATURE ON RESISTANCE, PERFORMANCE, MEMORY STUDIES, LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAWYERS, THE PAPER EXAMINES HOW CAUSE LAWYERS CHALLENGE AND SUBVERT POWER. THE PAPER FIRST EXPLORES THE TACTICS AND STRATEGIES OF CAUSE LAWYERS WHO BOYCOTT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUCH BOYCOTTS AND BROADER POLITICAL STRUGGLES, LEGITIMACY AND LAW. IT THEN EXAMINES WHY AND HOW CAUSE LAWYERS ENGAGE IN FAIRLY HOPELESS LEGAL STRUGGLES AS ACTS OF INSTRUMENTAL RESISTANCE (THE 'SAND IN THE COGS'), TRANSFORMING COURTS INTO SITES OF SYMBOLIC RESISTANCE, AND USING LAW AS A FORM OF MEMORY WORK. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT BOYCOTT OF AND RESISTANCE THROUGH THE COURTS CAN COUNTER THE USE OF LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF WICKEDNESS AND A TOOL OF DENIAL AND PRESERVES A 'STUBBORN OPTIMISM' IN THE RULE OF LAW.
773	THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR EVEN WHAT NORMATIVE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL ORDER IS ABLE TO ENCOURAGE THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MEASURE OF POSITIVE LIBERTY IN THE PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION. RELATED TO THIS IS THE ISSUE OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY ORTHODOX LIBERALISM FOR HUMAN SELF-DETERMINATION. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS POSSIBLE SCENARIOS AS TO THE WAY IN WHICH AN ELITE COSMOPOLITAN MINORITY, PROFITING FROM GLOBALIZATION AND FEELING NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAJORITY LEFT TO ITS OWN FATE, WOULD PURSUE ITS OWN INTERESTS. THE IDEAS OF RALF DAHRENDORF CONCERNING THE GLOBAL RULE OF LAW IN THE NAME OF FREEDOM AND THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE REFERRED TO. GLOBALIZATION IS OCCURRING JUST AS MARX INTUITIVELY PREDICTED: CAPITALISM BECOMES THE BEARER OF HIDDEN IMMANENT SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MECHANISMS. IN CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR'S HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE NEW ERA OF LAW IN THE 21ST CENTURY WILL ENSURE THAT CERTAIN CIVILIZATION LEGAL NORMS BECOME NATURAL OR CUSTOMARY.
774	WHAT DETERMINES HOW JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS PERFORM? PROMINENT THEORETICAL APPROACHES, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY, INSTITUTIONAL RATIONAL CHOICE, SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND STRUCTURAL THEORIES, SUGGEST THAT INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ACTORS, POLITICAL COMPETITION, POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, AND POVERTY MAY ALL BE IMPORTANT FORCES DRIVING INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOR. THIS STUDY ANALYZES THESE VARIOUS THEORETICAL APPROACHES AND USES QUALITATIVE AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO COMPARE JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE IN THE MEXICAN STATES. IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE INSTITUTIONAL RATIONAL CHOICE HYPOTHESIS THAT POLITICAL COMPETITION GENERATES JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. POVERTY, POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, AND AN EXPORT-ORIENTED ECONOMY SEEM TO INFLUENCE JUDICIAL ACCESS AND EFFECTIVENESS.
775	IN THE GROWING LITERATURE ON THE CREATION OF INSTITUTIONS, THE THEORIES EMPHASIZING COLONIAL ORIGIN (MAURO, 1995), LEGAL ORIGIN AND RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION (LA PORTA ET AL., 1999), WESTERN EUROPEAN INFLUENCE (HALL AND JONES, 1999), AND SETTLER MORTALITY (ACEMOGLU ET AL., 2001), HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY INFLUENTIAL. THE VALIDITY AND INFLUENCE OF THESE STUDIES RESTS HEAVILY ON EMPIRICAL MODELING, WHICH, SINCE THE THEORIES ARE OBVIOUSLY CLOSELY RELATED, MIGHT ACTUALLY CAPTURE THE SAME PRIMARY MECHANISM. IT IS THEREFORE UNCLEAR WHETHER THE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIPS FOUND ARE THE SAME OR IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER TAKES THE EMPIRICAL MODELS SERIOUSLY IN ORDER TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG THE EXISTING MODELS AND TO IDENTIFY THE MODEL AND VARIABLES THAT BEST EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS THUS TO PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (I) IS THERE ONE MODEL WHICH EXPLAINS MORE OF THE VARIATION IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAN THE OTHER MODELS? (II) DO THESE MODELS CAPTURE THE SAME INFORMATION? AND (III), IF WE LET THE INFORMATION IN THE DATA DECIDE, WHICH COMBINATION OF VARIABLES WOULD BE SELECTED?.
776	I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF A DECISION AS A PRECEDENT IN THE COMMON LAW, WHICH I REFER TO AS THE INDIVIDUAL RULE APPROACH AND THE HOLISTIC APPROACH. I CONSIDER THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE COMMON LAW THAT THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO GIVE RISE TO, WHICH APPROACH IS MORE CLOSELY REFLECTED IN THE PRACTICES OF THE COMMON LAW, AND WHY THE HOLISTIC APPROACH IS PREFERABLE AS A METHOD FOR FINDING AND DEVELOPING THE LAW IN ADJUDICATION. I EXPLAIN WHY UNDER THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THE COMMON LAW CONTAINS PRINCIPLES AS WELL AS RULES, AND I CONSIDER THE TWO APPROACHES IN THE LIGHT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND I SHOW HOW THE HOLISTIC APPROACH EXPLAINS A VERSION OF THE POLICY/PRINCIPLE DISTINCTION.
777	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE APPROACH OF BRITISH AND EUROPEAN COURTS TO THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE ARTICLE 5 ECHR RIGHT TO LIBERTY WHEN FACED WITH POLICE POWERS. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE LONG-STANDING APPROACH OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS INGUZZARDI V ITALY[1980] ECHR 7367/76 IS WRONG AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NEW INTERPRETATION BASED ON COERCION. THE PAPER GOES ON TO ARGUE THAT A NEW APPROACH WOULD ALLOW THE COURTS TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT BOTH CONVENTION RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
778	THIS ESSAY INTENDS TO DISCUSS THE READING OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SECULAR STATE IN BRAZIL THAT THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT HAS MADE IN ITS JURISPRUDENCE. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT, AT LEAST IN THIS REGARD, THE BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT HAS CONSTRUCTED AN OBLIQUE AND COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN LEGALITY AS A KIND OF RULE OF LAW TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE, SOMETIMES AFFECTED WHEN HEGEMONIC RELIGIOUS CONCEPTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE ANALYZED DECISIONS, MAINLY INVOLVING CLASHES BETWEEN SCIENCE AND RELIGION AND THE OPPOSITION OF HEGEMONIC RELIGIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF THE LGBTQIA+ POPULATION, ENABLE TO VERIFY THE HYPOTHESIS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PREVAILING THESES IN THEM AND IF THE SO-CALLED OBLIQUE AND COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN LEGALITY IS REALLY PRESENT IN THE DOMINANT JURISPRUDENTIAL CONCEPTION IN THE COURT ABOUT THE SECULAR STATE.
779	WE EXAMINE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE CASH TRANSFERS ON MULTIDIMENSIONAL EXTREME POVERTY IN THE STATES OF MEXICO FOR 2008-2018. WE ESTIMATE ECONOMETRIC MODELS WITH PANEL DATA WITH OLS AND 2SLS AND WITH CROSS-SECTION DATA WITH GMM THAT SHIELD AGAINST ENDOGENEITY OF THE DETERMINANTS OF POVERTY. WE PROVE THAT THERE ARE PERVERSE INCENTIVES THAT HAVE CAUSED THAT TRANSFERS PERPETUATE POVERTY IN THE LESS DEVELOPED STATES. HOMICIDES AND INFORMAL EMPLOYMENT HAVE PERPETUATED IT. AGRICULTURAL LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, PRODUCTIVE EXPORT ORIENTATION, AND A BETTER RULE OF LAW REDUCE IT.
780	THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THE CONDITIONS OF POSSIBILITY FOR THE CRITIQUE OF THE NEW ILLIBERALISM EXEMPLIFIED BY LEADERS SUCH AS DONALD TRUMP AND JACOB ZUMA. IT PROPOSES THREE HYPOTHESES. THE FIRST IS THAT CORRUPTION IS MORE THAN JUST A FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IS ALSO ITS INNERMOST POSSIBILITY AND END RESULT. THE SECOND IS THAT THE NEW ILLIBERALISM PRESUPPOSES THE SUBLATION OF A CERTAIN TRADITION OF CRITIQUE (FOCUSED ON THE PRACTICES OF UNMASKING AND TRANSPARENCY). THE THIRD IS THAT CRITIQUE TODAY NEEDS THE COURAGE TO FACE A "GIDDY WORLD."
781	THE AUTHOR PRESENTS A CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION OF THE POLISH MODEL OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND STATES OF EMERGENCY AND RELATES THEM TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020. THEN, HE ANALYSES IN DETAIL THE CONTENT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW (VENICE COMMISSION) OF 26 MAY 2020 (RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW DURING STATES OF EMERGENCY REFLECTIONS), REGARDING THE ELECTIONS IN STATES OF EMERGENCY AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN POLAND IN 2020. THE OPINION POSITIVELY EVALUATES ALL THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONSIDERS THAT THE EXISTING AND NEW EXCEPTIONAL POLISH ELECTORAL LAW REGULATIONS RESPECTING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ARE FULLY COMPLAINT WITH THEM.
782	IN HIS RESEARCH ON THE GOVERNANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW (1936), FRANZ L. NEUMANN (1900-1954) CLAIMS THAT NINETEENTH CENTURY LIBERAL CAPITALISM HAD TRANSFORMED INTO AN ERA OF MONOPOLISTIC CAPITALISM IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THIS, ACCORDING TO HIM, LED TO THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RISE OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE. 'THIS ARTICLE REVISITS NEUMANN'S CRITICAL LEGAL THEORY AND DISCUSSES HIS MARXIST THEORY OF DECAY. THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT BY REVISING THE SCHEMATIC MARXIST OPPOSITION, WE CAN OPEN UP PATHWAYS OF RENEWING NEUMANN'S DIALECTICAL THEORY OF LAW.
783	THIS TWO-PART PAPER SEEKS TO INVITE DISCUSSION ON A DEEPLY EMBEDDED NARRATIVE IN THE EUROPEAN SCHOLARLY AND PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT REDUCES THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS TO EUROSCEPTIC, OLD-FASHIONED RELUCTANCE TO RELINQUISH SOVEREIGNTY. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLISTIC 'EUROSCEPTIC'-'EURO-FRIENDLY' LOOKING GLASS, THE DISCOURSE HAS BROADLY BEEN OBLIVIOUS OF, AND GIVEN SCHOLARLY LEGITIMACY TO, THE EROSION OF A RANGE OF CLASSIC CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS IN EU LAW. PART 1 OF THE PAPER, DOCUMENTING COMPARATIVE CASE LAW IN SEVEN AREAS, POSITS AN EMERGENCE AT THE EU LEVEL OF THE ADOPTION OF MEASURES WHICH, IF ATTEMPTED AT NATIONAL LEVEL WITHOUT THE CONSTRAINTS OF EU LAW, WOULD IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS PROMPT CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS TO VOICE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT CORE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. THE CASE STUDIES START WITH SOME PAST CRITICISMS REGARDING RIGHTS PROTECTION IN THE SINGLE MARKET, MOVING THEN TO EU MEASURES THAT HAVE AFFECTED CORE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES, SUCH AS SECRET ANTI-TERRORIST MEASURES, THE DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE, THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT SYSTEM WITH ITS NUMEROUS KAFKAESQUE ELEMENTS, THE BROADER MOVE TOWARDS IMPOSITION OF CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS ON THE BASIS OF TELEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND WITHOUT A LAW, AND THE ESM TREATY. THE PAPER ALSO QUERIES THE REDUCED ACCESS TO COURTS, THE CHANGING ROLE OF COURTS AND AN EMERGING GAP IN CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, PART 2 OF THE PAPER CALLS FOR RECALIBRATING THE DISCOURSE TOWARDS 'SUBSTANTIVE CO-OPERATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM'. THE AIM IS TO EXPLORE HOW TO BETTER UPHOLD THE STANDARDS OF PROTECTION DEVELOPED BY NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND SUPREME COURTS FOR CLASSIC, SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES, IN A CONTEXT WHERE EU CONSTITUTIONAL LAW HAS BROUGHT ABOUT A SHIFT TOWARDS A THIN, WEAK, PROCEDURAL VERSION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REVIEW, WITH PRIORITY GIVEN TO EFFECTIVENESS, UNIFORMITY, TRUST AND, AFTER MELLONI, SUPREMACY OVER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
784	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SECURITY CHALLENGES IN THE SELECTED STATES IN EURASIA AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEACE AND POLITICS. SINCE THE SECURITY SITUATION DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE SUB-REGIONS UNDER SCRUTINY, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH IS TO ESTABLISH AND TEST A THEORETICAL MODEL OF RELEVANT COMBINATIONS OF POLITICAL FACTORS AND THEIR RELATION TO PEACE. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN DESIGNED BY FOLLOWING FUKUYAMA'S IDEA OF POLITICAL ORDER AND UPGRADED WITH THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED INDEX OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - ACCORDING TO THE OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGICAL GAPS IN THIS FIELD, THE PAPER APPLIES COMPARATIVE FUZZY SET ANALYSIS. THE METHOD RELIES ON THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND EMPIRICAL DATA AND ALLOWS A CONSTANT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO. IT HAS ALLOWED THE RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON WHAT CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND/OR SUFFICIENT FOR PEACE IN THE SELECTED COUNTRIES. FINDINGS - IT IS EVIDENT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PATHS TO ACHIEVE PEACE. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW CLEARLY CONSTITUTES BOTH THE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR PEACE IN THE SELECTED REGIONS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH REVEAL THAT THE CONCEPTS OF INTEREST ARE HIGHLY INTERLINKED WITH EACH OTHER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE OF LAW, STATE, AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. THUS, FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE TO EXPLORE WHICH CONDITIONS OR COMBINATIONS ARE DECISIVE IN PARTICULAR SETTING. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - SUCH FINDINGS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE AREAS WHERE EURASIAN COUNTRIES ARE STILL LAGGING BEHIND. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITHIN THESE FOUR GROUPINGS OF COUNTRIES, TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF PREREQUISITES FOR PEACE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATE AND HUMAN SECURITY IN THE EU NEIGHBORHOOD.
785	THIS ARTICLE IS AN INTERVENTION IN LONG-STANDING DEBATES IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND THE THEORY OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. IN JURISPRUDENTIAL TERMS, IT ELABORATES ON H.L.A. HART'S CONCEPT OF THE INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW, WHICH IS THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE WHO VIEWS THE LAW AS CREATING OBLIGATIONS, NOT MERELY AFFECTING ONE'S PRUDENTIAL CALCULATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, HART'S IDEA IS THAT THE LAW MUST BE CAPABLE OF NORMATIVITY. HART LIMITED THIS CONCEPTUAL REQUIREMENT TO JUDGES, WHO ARE OBLIGATED TO TAKE THE INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW, LEAVING A DEEPLY IMPORTANT OPEN QUESTION CONCERNING THE ATTITUDE THAT CITIZENS AND THEIR ADVISORS MUST TAKE WITH RESPECT TO THE LAW. THE ARGUMENT IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT IT IS A CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLE OF THE PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF LAWYERS THAT THEY REGARD THE LAW FROM THE INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW. FROM THIS OBLIGATION FLOW FURTHER, MORE SPECIFIC DUTIES OF GOOD FAITH IN INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE CONNECTS SCHOLARSHIP ON THE NATURE OF LAW WITH MORE PRACTICAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF LAWYERS ADVISING CLIENTS. IT PROVIDES AN ANALYTICALLY RIGOROUS APPROACH TO EVALUATING THE CONDUCT OF LAWYERS IN HIGH-PROFILE SCANDALS SUCH AS THE PANAMA PAPERS REVELATIONS, THE SO-CALLED TORTURE MEMOS PREPARED BY LAWYERS IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, AND ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN'S MEMO EXPLAINING THE FIRING OF FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. THE POSITION DEFENDED HERE DIFFERS FROM BOTH THE NINETEENTH CENTURY "WISE COUNSELOR" CONCEPTION OF LAWYER PROFESSIONALISM AND THE STANDARD CONCEPTION OF LEGAL ETHICS AS "ZEALOUS ADVOCACY WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW." IT IS IN SOME WAYS AN ELABORATION ON SOME OF MY PREVIOUS SCHOLARSHIP ON LEGAL ETHICS AND INTERPRETATION OF LAW, BUT IT IS GROUNDED MUCH MORE EXPLICITLY NOT ONLY IN HART'S NOTION OF THE INTERNAL POINT OF VIEW BUT-PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY-ALSO IN LON FULLER'S INSIGHT THAT LAW IS A PURPOSIVE ACTIVITY CHARACTERIZED BY GIVING REASONS OF A CERTAIN TYPE IN JUSTIFICATION OF ONE'S ACTIONS.
786	SAMOA'S 2021 CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS SAW UNPRECEDENTED ATTACKS ON THE NATION'S JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION PARTY (HRPP) REFUSED TO CONCEDE DEFEAT AFTER A TIGHTLY CONTESTED GENERAL ELECTION ON 9 APRIL 2021. THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO THE INCOMING FAMODIFIED LETTER TURNED COMMAATUATUA I LE ATUA SAMOA UA TASI (FAST) GOVERNMENT WAS STYMIED BY DETERMINED EFFORTS SUCH AS THE ATTEMPTED EXPLOITATION OF THE WOMEN'S PARLIAMENTARY QUOTA, ATTEMPTS TO JUSTIFY THE CALLING OF FRESH ELECTIONS AND THE LOCKING OF THE PARLIAMENTARY CHAMBER TO PREVENT PARLIAMENT'S FIRST MEETING. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LAWFULNESS OF THESE ACTIONS WAS REPEATEDLY CHALLENGED IN SAMOA'S COURTS IN A HIGHLY CHARGED POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE THAT PERSISTENTLY IGNORED COURT RULINGS. IT OUTLINES HOW SAMOA'S JUDICIARY CAME UNDER SERIOUS AND REPEATED THREAT BY CONSTITUTIONAL ACTORS, IN PARTICULAR THE HEAD OF STATE, THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT, AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT DESPITE THESE CRITICAL CHALLENGES, THE RULINGS OF THE COURTS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED THE FOUR-MONTH IMPASSE THROUGH DECISIONS ON AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF COMPLEX AND NOVEL CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. THE COURTS' ROLE IN THE CRISIS DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF A SOUND AND INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY IN SMALL ISLAND STATES WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS AND FUNCTIONING OF A MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY ARE ATTACKED.
787	PHILOSOPHICALLY IT IS ACCEPTED THAT A CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS A STATE'S SOLEMN COMMITMENT TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES SET OUT WITHIN THAT SACRED DOCUMENT. GIVEN SOUTH AFRICA'S PAST, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996, HOLDS THE PROMISE OF A FREE, DEMOCRATIC AND EGALITARIAN SOCIETY. UNDERPINNING THE CONSTITUTION IS THE AFRICAN CONCEPT OF UBUNTU WHICH ITSELF IS PREMISED ON NOTIONS OF DIGNITY, COMPASSION, HUMANITY, FORGIVENESS AND RECONCILIATION: SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO HEAL THE DIVISIONS OF THE PAST AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE SOUTH AFRICAN LEGAL, SOCIO-POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LANDSCAPE. ENGAGING WITH PERTINENT CASE LAW EMANATING FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AN ANALYSIS IS UNDERTAKEN AS TO WHETHER THE PROVISIONS ON GENDER EQUALITY CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION HAVE LIVED UP TO THE EXPECTATION AND OBLIGATION PLACED ON THEM TO TRANSFORM SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIETY. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS MADE BOLD AND COURAGEOUS DECISIONS WHICH HAVE STAYED TRUE TO THE RULE OF LAW BY DEVELOPING LAWS TO BRING THEM INTO CONSONANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION, THEREBY ENGINEERING SOCIETY TO GIVE MEANINGFUL EFFECT TO GENDER EQUALITY. HOWEVER, MUCH PROGRESS STILL REMAINS TO BE MADE, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE COURT'S APPARENT IGNORANCE OF THE LACK OF AGENCY, AND AUTONOMY AND EMPOWERMENT SUFFERED BY MANY WOMEN.
788	THIS WORK ANALYSES HOW THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND HAS DECLINED SINCE THE ELECTIONS HELD IN THE COUNTRY IN 2015, IN WHICH THE ULTRACONSERVATIVE PARTY LAW AND JUSTICE OBTAINED THE MAJORITY IN BOTH LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS AND REACHED THE GOVERNMENT. SINCE THEN, THIS SITUATION HAS ALLOWED THE PARTY TO MODIFY THE LAW, SO THAT IT ENDED UP AFFECTING THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE COUNTRY. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE MODIFICATION IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AND THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OR THE POLITIZATION OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY, WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORGAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS IN POLAND, CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DETERIORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS SCENARIO, A REACTION IN FORM OF DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE CJEU AND THE ECHR APPEARS, AND BOTH TRIBUNALS QUOTE EACH OTHER THROUGH THEIR JUDGEMENTS DEVELOPING THE CONCEPT OF "TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW". IN THIS WAY, BOTH ESTABLISH THAT THE IRREGULARITIES IN THE PROCEDURE OF APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE RIGHT OF A TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW, THUS INCLUDING THE APPOINTMENT IN THE SCOPE OF THIS RIGHT.
789	A TYPICAL EXPRESSION OF THE INDULGENTIA PRINAPIS, INDIVIDUAL DEMENCY HAS BEEN SEVERELY CRITICIZED AT THE DAWN OF MODERN CRIMINAL LAW. IT WAS NOT ONLY A THEORETICAL OPPOSITION, BUT RATHER IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE REFORM OF THE TUSCAN CRIMINAL LEGISLATION OF 1786. DESPITE THE CONDEMNATION OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT, THE PARDON SURVIVED, GATHERING OVER TIME A WIDE RANGE OF STRATIFIED CRITICAL OPINIONS. JUST WHEN ONE OF HIS "TRANSFIGURED" VERSIONS SEEMED TO BE PLACED - NOT WITHOUT COMPROMISES - WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, THE ITALIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, IN 2006, RESTORED THE IMAGE OF AN UNQUESTIONABLE AND POLITICALLY IRRESPONSIBLE POWER. SO, WHAT IS THE GENOME - ITS PROVENANCE, ITS NATURE - SO RESISTANT WITHIN THE INSTITUTE? COULD IT PERHAPS BE A "DIFFERENT" PARDON, DEPRIVED OF ITS ORIGINAL CHARACTERISTICS (WHICH REPRESENT ITS VERY FOUNDATIONS)? IS THIS REALLY AN IRREPLACEABLE REMEDY, FOR THE PENAL SYSTEM?
790	LAW, REASON, AND EMOTION HAVE A LONG, CLOSE, AND COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND JUSTICE. THIS DISCUSSION SUGGESTS THAT THAT LAW GAINS LEGITIMACY AND EFFECTIVENESS WHEN IT MARRIES REASON WITH EMOTION, THAT REASON AND HUMAN EMOTION ARE THE GUIDING VALUES OF ANY JUST LEGAL SYSTEM, THAT ALL LEGAL SYSTEMS CLAIM TO BE JUST, AND THAT ALL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS MAKE USE OF THESE INSIGHTS WHETHER THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEM OR NOT. THE PROJECT HERE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE IS ONE OF DEFINITION: "LAW", "REASON", "EMOTION", "JUSTICE", "EFFECTIVENESS", AND "THE RULE OF LAW" ALL REQUIRE SPECIFICATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AND SET THE AGENDA FOR FURTHER CONVERSATION. THE FIRST STEP IS TO CONSIDER HOW THESE WORDS HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD BE USED FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND EVENTUAL IMPROVEMENT OF LAW AND SOCIETY. REASON AND EMOTION ARE THE TWIN PILLARS OF THE LAW, WHICH MAKE THE LAW LEGITIMATE, JUST, AND EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY ARE PROPERLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND OTHERWISE NOT. NO ONE CAN PROPERLY UNDERSTAND LAW WITHOUT REFERENCE BOTH TO HUMAN EMOTION AND TO THE PURPOSE LAW PROPERLY EXISTS TO SERVE, WHICH IS THE RATIONAL WELL-BEING OF EACH AND EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY.
791	THIS ESSAY HAS TWO PURPOSES-FIRST, TO IDENTIFY ADAM SMITH AS INTERVENING IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN MONTESQUIEU AND HUME REGARDING THE NATURE, AGE, AND ROBUSTNESS OF ENGLISH LIBERTY. WHEREAS MONTESQUIEU TOOK ENGLISH LIBERTY TO BE OLD AND FRAGILE, HUME TOOK IT TO BE NEW AND ROBUST. SMITH DISAGREED WITH BOTH: IT WAS OLDER THAN HUME SUPPOSED, BUT NOT FRAGILE IN THE WAY MONTESQUIEU CLAIMED. THE REASON FOR THIS WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMON LAW IN ENGLAND'S LEGAL HISTORY. SEEING THIS ENABLES THE ESSAY'S SECOND PURPOSE: ACHIEVING A MORE THOROUGH AND NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF SMITH'S ACCOUNT OF LIBERTY. THIS REQUIRES US TO GO BEYOND REPEATING SMITH'S FAMOUS CLAIM THAT MODERN LIBERTY WAS THE RESULT OF THE FEUDAL BARONS TRADING AWAY THEIR WEALTH AND POWER FOR INANE STATUS GOODS. AS I DEMONSTRATE, THIS IS ONLY ONE PART OF A MUCH WIDER STORY: OF LIBERTY REQUIRING, AND ALSO BEING CONSTITUTED BY, THE RISE OF THE REGULAR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, AND ULTIMATELY THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH SMITH'S HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH COURTS AND COMMON LAW HAS BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY NEGLECTED BY SCHOLARS, IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO UNDERSTANDING BOTH HIS REPLY TO MONTESQUIEU AND HUME AND HIS WIDER POLITICAL THEORY OF MODERN FREEDOM.
792	CAN DEMOCRACY BE EXPANDED BEYOND BORDERS? FOR MANY YEARS, IT WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT THE NORMS AND VALUES OF DEMOCRACY COULD BE APPLIED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF A STATE ONLY. BUT OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, IT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY ARGUED THAT DEMOCRACY CAN ALSO INFORM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND GLOBAL POLITICS. THIS ARTICLE RECAPITULATES THE FOUNDATIONS OF COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY, A PROJECT OF NORMATIVE POLITICAL THEORY DEVELOPED SINCE THE EARLY 1990S. THE ARTICLE ALSO EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING TOWARDS COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY IN SPECIFIC DOMAINS SUCH AS: (1) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL RULE OF LAW; (2) THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STAKE-HOLDERS IN TRANS-BORDER POLITICAL DECISIONS; AND (3) THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING VOICE TO CITIZENS THROUGH A WORLD PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY. THE PAPER FINALLY EXPLORES HOW CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION CAN USE COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, PROVIDES A MODEL OF IT.
793	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, NORMATIVE, AND JURISPRUDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE LED TO THE POLISH LEGAL SYSTEM BEING ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ON THE SUBJECT OF ABORTION RIGHTS IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT. BY CRITICALLY ANALYZING THESE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS, WE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER WE SHOULD ACCEPT A STATE OF "GLOBAL LEGAL INDETERMINISM" REGARDING VOLUNTARY INTERRUPTION OF PREGNANCY OR IF THERE ARE FORCES THAT CAN PUSH NATIONAL DISCIPLINES TOWARD "MINIMUM" STANDARDS SHARED ON THE EUROPEAN HORIZON AND RESPECT FOR A SUPRA -AND INTERNATIONAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
794	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES AND EVALUATES THE PROCESS OF FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE IN VIETNAM, INDICATES ITS FEATURES FOR EACH PERIOD, INCLUDING THE FIRST STAGE FROM 1945 TO 1959, THE SECOND STAGE FROM 1960 TO 2001 AND THE THIRD STAGE FROM 2002 TO THE PRESENT, THE DEVELOPMENT ORIENTATION OF THE PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE. THROUGH ANALYSIS TO CLARIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE OF VIETNAM IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE, FUNCTIONS AND TASKS, A CONNECTION IS TRACED WITH THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL REFORM IN VIETNAM. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE ALSO REVEALS THE INFLUENCE OF SOME FACTORS ON THE FORMATION AND ACTIVITIES OF THE PEOPLE'S PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OF VIETNAM, SUCH AS NATIONAL CULTURE, TRADITIONAL LEGAL FOUNDATIONS, MARXIST--LENINIST TEACHINGS ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIALIST STATE APPARATUS, ETC.
795	THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF THE REASONING BEHIND JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN BRAZILIAN LAW. IT BEGINS WITH A STUDY OF THE PROCEDURAL NORMS REGULATING THE DUTY TO MOTIVATE JUDICIAL DECISIONS, EXPLAINING THE FUNCTIONS, CHARACTERISTICS, AND OBJECTIVES OF REASONING UNDER THE PARADIGMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LEGITIMACY OF THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION, AND THE RIGHT TO ADVERSARIAL PROCEEDINGS IN ITS STRONG SENSE. THE METHOD IS BIBLIOGRAPHIC WITH A THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS, CONSISTS OF EXAMINING AND INTERPRETING THE IDEAS AND ARGUMENTS OF DWORKIN ABOUT JUSTICE, EMPLOYING AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH. FURTHER, THE JUDICIAL DUTY OF REASONING IS DISCUSSED IN LIGHT OF RONALD DWORKIN, WITH REGARD TO THE NEED FOR RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION OF DECISIONS TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT ANSWER, CONSIDERED AS THE CONJUNCTION BETWEEN THE BEST SOLUTION THAT CAN BE GIVEN BY THE JUDGE AND THE BEST SOLUTION TO BE OBTAINED IN THE SPECIFIC CASE, ALWAYS BASED ON THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BY THE PARTIES. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE DOMINANT JURISPRUDENTIAL POSITION THAT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE OBLIGATION OF THE JUDGE TO RESPOND TO ALL ISSUES RAISED BY THE PARTIES, AS WELL AS THE MISMATCH OF THIS UNDERSTANDING WITH DWORKIN'S DOCTRINE AND WITH THE NORMS FROM WHICH THE JUDICIAL DUTY OF REASONING DERIVES.
796	THIS PAPER ANALYZES SOME OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF FOREIGN STATES IN THE CATALAN SECESSION PROCESS, PRESENTING THE DATA AVAILABLE TO DATE. WHAT ARE THE BEHAVIORS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE KINGDOM OF BELGIUM AGAINST THE PROHIBITION OF INTERVENTION IN THE AFFAIRS OF SPAIN? IT IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTRIBUTE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN BOTH CASES. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, THE FACTS SHOW THE RUSSIAN INTEREST IN EXERTING ITS INFLUENCE IN THE AREA, AS WELL AS THE POLITICAL IRRESPONSIBILITY OF SOME SECESSIONIST LEADERS WHO CONSIDERED THAT THE CATALAN REPUBLIC SHOULD SUBMIT TO AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE LIKE RUSSIA. FOR THEIR PART, THE SILENCE OF THE TWO SPANISH GOVERNMENTS BEFORE THE EVENTS OF WATERLOO, SHOWS THE WEAK POSITION OF SPAIN BEFORE THEIR EUROPEAN AND EURO-ATLANTIC PARTNERS; AT THE SAME TIME, THEY SHOW RULERS WITH LITTLE APPRECIATION FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS DISDAIN FOR THE RIGHT TO INTERNAL SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE ENTIRE SPANISH POPULATION.
797	A SUBSTANTIAL CONSENSUS HAS EMERGED IN DEVELOPMENT CIRCLES THAT THE REASON WHY SOME COUNTRIES ARE RICH AND OTHERS POOR IS LARGELY A REFLECTION OF THE QUALITY OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS - POLITICAL, BUREAUCRATIC, AND LEGAL - AND THAT COUNTRIES WITH SERIOUSLY DYSFUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS CANNOT EXPECT TO PURSUE A SUCCESSFUL LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. MANY STUDIES SUPPORT THIS CONSENSUS, BUT INSTITUTIONAL REFORM EFFORTS FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE RESULTED IN MIXED TO WEAK RESULTS; MANY OF THESE EFFORTS HAVE FAILED, FOR EXAMPLE, TO ESTABLISH A ROBUST RULE OF LAW TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE POLITICAL REGIMES, A MERITOCRATIC, NONCORRUPT, AND EFFICIENT BUREAUCRACY, AND AN INDEPENDENT MEDIA. REPORTEDLY UP TO 60% OF DONOR-ASSISTED REFORMS HAVE YIELDED NO MEASURABLE INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS. IT IS INFERRED FROM THIS DISAPPOINTING RESULT THAT INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPLANTS ARE OFTEN INEFFECTIVE, AND THE PATH DEPENDENCE, CAUSED BY ACCRETIONS OF THE PARTICULARITIES OF GIVEN COUNTRIES' HISTORIES, CULTURES, POLITICS, ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS MAKE-UP, AND GEOGRAPHY LEAVES EACH COUNTRY, FOR THE MOST PART, "TO WRITE ITS OWN HISTORY".
798	SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, MINING INDUSTRIES IN POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENTS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF LITERATURE ON CANADIAN IMPERIALISM AND ITS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY IN GUATEMALA. HOWEVER, LITTLE KNOWLEDGE EXISTS ON CANADA'S SUPPORT OF STRATEGIC HUMAN RIGHTS LITIGATION (SHRL) PROJECTS FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS AFFECTED BY THE GUATEMALAN ARMED CONFLICT AND EXTRACTIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THIS CONTRADICTORY COMMITMENT TO SHRL THROUGH A CASE-STUDY OF CANADA'S SUPPORT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CONFLICT GUATEMALA. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CANADA'S PARTICIPATION IN GUATEMALA'S SECURITISATION PROCESSES DEMONSTRATES CANADIAN ECONOMIC AND SECURITY OBJECTIVES IN THE EXTRACTIVE SECTOR AS WELL AS SELF-AFFIRMATION GOALS AMONG DONORS. BASED ON FIELD INTERVIEWS AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION REQUESTS, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL INSIGHTS ON SHRL PROJECTS IN POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES WITH EXTRACTIVE RESOURCES.
799	THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NOMOS-OBSERVING THEORY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, TERMED 'RULE EGALITARIANISM', THAT EXPLAINS HOW THE SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY MERGER OF CLASSICAL LIBERALISM AND SOCIAL JUSTICE IS CONCEIVABLE. THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS SUCH A THEORY CONSISTS IN ENSURING THAT A CONCERN FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS ETCHED IN THE VERY CORE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, IN WHICH CASE SOME EGALITARIAN RULES WILL BE ACCEPTABLE FROM A CLASSICAL LIBERAL VIEWPOINT. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF CAPITALISM CAN INDEED BE DESIGNED TO REDUCE INEQUALITY IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE INASMUCH AS ANY EGALITARIAN GOAL IS SPECIFIED IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL RULES. MORE PRECISELY, RULES IN A LIBERAL POLITY SHOULD BE GENERAL AND ABSTRACT, WHICH WILL LEAD US TO ESTABLISH A DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOUR CONCEPTS OF RULES, NAMELY BETWEEN LAWS, REGULATIONS, STATUTES AND DECREES. MOREOVER, AGAINST THE NEOCLASSICAL LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, RULE EGALITARIANISM ARGUES THAT HAVING GENERAL AND ABSTRACT RULES OF MARKET CAPITALISM IMPOSES SOME CONSTRAINTS ON ANY INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK SO THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE BECOMES NECESSARY TO CORRECT THE ERRORS OF IMPERFECT GENERALISATIONS, LEAVING SOME PEOPLE BEHIND.
800	THE PROBLEM ADDRESSED IN THIS ARTICLE IS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY MODEL IN ANALYZING POST-COMMUNIST DEMOCRACIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR RECENT ACCESSION INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION OF THIS QUESTION, THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS UTILIZED IN LIGHT OF PAST AND RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN BULGARIA, HUNGARY, POLAND AND ROMANIA. SEVERAL PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE DIMENSIONS OF THE MODEL ARE EXAMINED, PARTICULARLY PARTICIPATION AND COMPETITION, ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION AND ASPECTS OF POPULAR LEGITIMACY. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT WHILE THE MODEL PROVES ITS ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE SPECIFIC DYNAMICS AND PECULIARITIES OF THESE CASES, IT IS LESS SUCCESSFUL IN SHOWING HOW DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY BECOMES INSTITUTIONALIZED.
801	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW JUSTICE AND SOCIAL ORDER ARE ADMINISTERED AND EXPERIENCED IN POOR, POLITICALLY FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED ENVIRONMENTS. TAKING NOTIONS OF LEGAL PLURALISM AND PUBLIC AUTHORITY AS OUR STARTING POINT, WE EXPLORE HOW MORAL AND SOCIAL WORLDS ARE UNDERSTOOD IN PLACES WHERE 'THE LAW' IS NOT NECESSARILY A DISCRETE INSTITUTIONALISED PROCESS. DRAWING UPON CURRENT DEBATES IN THE FIELD, AS WELL AS FINDINGS FROM THE SIX ARTICLES IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE, WE EXPLORE HOW LEGAL PLURALISM AND PUBLIC AUTHORITY OPERATE IN CONTEXT; HOW WE MIGHT EVALUATE WHETHER 'JUSTICE' IS BEING DONE'; AND THE STARK DISSONANCES BETWEEN LOCAL REALITIES AND THE NORMATIVE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CURRENTLY GUIDE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS, PARTICULARLY AROUND RULE-OF-LAW REFORM AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE INITIATIVES.
802	PURPOSE ALTHOUGH RECENT MODELS OF PLACE BRANDING HAVE PROPOSED CULTURE AS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT IN ESTABLISHING A STRONG PLACE OR NATION BRAND, THE WAY IN WHICH CULTURAL PRODUCTS INFLUENCE THE BRAND EQUITY OF OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THE SAME NATION HAS NOT YET BEEN STUDIED. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ARGUE THAT WHEN A NATION HAS STRONG LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, AS PERCEIVED BY INVESTORS AND MANAGERS, IT OFFERS FERTILE SOIL FOR CULTIVATING CULTURAL PRODUCTS THAT, WHEN EXPORTED, CAN ACT AS "CULTURAL AMBASSADORS," PROMOTING THE COUNTRY IMAGE IN THE MINDS OF CONSUMERS AND THE VALUE OF THE COUNTRY'S BRANDS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH EXPORTS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED BY UNESCO. VALUABLE BRANDS ARE THOSE THAT BRAND FINANCE INCLUDED IN ITS GLOBAL TOP 500 MOST VALUABLE BRANDS LIST. THE RULE OF LAW IS PROVIDED BY THE WORLD BANK. PANEL REGRESSION MODELS ARE USED. FINDINGS SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESES, EXPORTS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTS SHOW POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE VALUE OF BRANDS FROM THAT COUNTRY, AND THE RULE OF LAW SHOWS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON EXPORTS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS POLICYMAKERS COULD IMPROVE THE BRAND VALUE OF LOCAL FIRMS BY PROMOTING EXPORTS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTS. TO DO SO, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD INITIATE JUDICIAL REFORMS THAT STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW TO PROTECT CONTRACTS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE HITHERTO UNDEREXPLORED EFFECTS THAT A COUNTRY'S CULTURAL PRODUCT EXPORTS HAVE ON THE BRAND VALUE OF FIRMS FROM THAT COUNTRY. MOST PRIOR RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON FACTORS AFFECTING IMPORTS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTS.
803	AS A SYSTEM THAT IS SYMBOLIC OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA, THE POLITICALLEGAL SYSTEM REFERS TO THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC), LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL AGENCIES AND VARIOUS GOVERNANCE SUBJECTS JOINTLY PROMOTE A PEACEFUL CHINA INITIATIVE AND BUILD A CHINA UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION FROM THE CLASSICAL RITES-LAW TRADITION TO THE MODERN POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM REFLECTS THE CONSISTENT POLITICAL FOCUS AND IDEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF CHINA'S POLITICIANS AND THINKERS ABOUT THE NATIONAL RISE AND FALL. THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PRINCIPAL GROUPS OF RELATIONSHIPS, NAMELY, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIOUS LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL AGENCIES, THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL AGENCIES AND EXTERNAL BODIES, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CPC AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL AGENCIES. THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THESE THREE PRINCIPAL GROUPS OF RELATIONSHIPS CONSTITUTE THE BASIC RULES FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND PRACTICAL OPERATION OF THE POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM. THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE FIRST GROUP OF RELATIONSHIPS RELATE TO SELF-INTEGRATION, DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, MUTUAL COOPERATION AND MUTUAL RESTRAINT. THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE SECOND GROUP OF RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVE PRIORITIZING SOCIAL AUTONOMY, PRIMARY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE AND FRONT-END GOVERNANCE. THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE THIRD GROUP OF RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONCERNED WITH MACRO-LEADERSHIP, CENTRALIZED LEADERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYSIS OF THESE THREE SETS OF NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES SHOWS THAT CHINA'S POLITICAL-LEGAL SYSTEM NOT ONLY FOLLOWS THE UNIVERSAL LAW AND COMMON MECHANISM OF MODERN NATIONAL GOVERNANCE, BUT ALSO ACCUMULATES THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE AND UNIQUE WISDOM OF CHINA'S GOVERNANCE.
804	SINCE RUSSIA'S TAKEOVER OF CRIMEA IN 2014 RUSSIAN PUBLIC RALLIED AROUND THE FLAG AND PUBLIC OPINION ENTERED A RELATIVELY STATIC STATE OFTEN CALLED THE "CRIMEAN CONSENSUS". THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF 2018 BECAME A TURNING POINT IN THE DYNAMICS OF PUBLIC OPINION. SOCIOLOGICAL DATA FROM THAT PERIOD REVEALS GROWING ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT SENTIMENTS, DEMAND FOR CHANGE, SOCIAL JUSTICE, A PEACEFUL FOREIGN POLICY, AND CIVIC ACTIVISM. TO ANALYZE THESE CHANGES THE STUDY COMBINES DATA FROM FOUR ROUNDS OF FOCUS GROUPS WITH SOCIOLOGICAL SURVEYS ON THE MATURITY OF MORAL VALUES AND THE PERCEPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL INJUSTICE, CONDUCTED DURING 2018-2020. ALL SOURCES OF OUR SOCIOLOGICAL DATA DEMONSTRATE, THAT THE MAIN CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POST-MATERIALIST VALUES: DEMAND FOR THE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PREVAILS OVER CONCERNS ABOUT BASIC CONSUMPTION AND MATERIAL INEQUALITY. THE DATA ALSO REVEALS A VALUE RELATED RIFT BETWEEN THE RULING ELITES AND THE POPULATION. WHEREAS THE POPULATION INCREASINGLY DEMANDS THE RULE OF LAW AND/OR SOCIAL CONTRACT, THE RULING CLASS, AS THE RESPONDENTS PERCEIVE IT, REMAINS GUIDED BY INTERPERSONAL DEALINGS AND CONFORMISM. THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF POSTMATERIALIST VALUES IN DEFINING THE NEW SOCIAL AGENDA IMPLIES THAT THE ONGOING CHANGES ARE NOT TEMPORARY AND REVERSIBLE BUT REFLECT A MORE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESS OF TRANSITION TO POSTMATERIALIST VALUE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, GIVEN A SHORT PERIOD OF OBSERVATIONS THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IS NOT FULLY CONCLUSIVE. DATA FROM THE NEW ROUND OF EUROPEAN VALUES STUDY EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED BEFORE THE END OF 2020 CAN HELP CLARIFY THE DYNAMICS OF VALUE CHANGE IN RUSSIA AND ITS POSSIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE RECENT EVOLUTION OF PUBLIC OPINION.
805	SINCE 2013, THE NAURU GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERMINED DEMOCRACY BY REDUCING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, TREATING OPPOSITION MPS AS POTENTIAL TRAITORS, CURBING FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RESTRICTING VISITS BY VARIOUSLY DEFINED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO INCLUDE JOURNALISTS, AUSTRALIANS AND NEW ZEALANDERS. NEW ZEALAND RESPONDED BY SUSPENDING ITS AID TO NAURU'S JUSTICE AND BORDER CONTROL DEPARTMENT. AUSTRALIA, BY CONTRAST, HAS SAID LITTLE. THE NAURU GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT HAVE ACTED SO BOLDLY IN CURBING CIVIL FREEDOMS AND WEAKENING THE RULE OF LAW IF AUSTRALIA HAD BEEN LESS DEPENDENT ON ITS GOODWILL TO ACT AS HOST FOR AUSTRALIA'S REGIONAL PROCESSING CENTRE, WHICH HOUSES ASYLUM SEEKERS WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REACH AUSTRALIA BY BOAT. AUSTRALIA'S RELIANCE ON NAURU - DRIVEN BY URGENT DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS - HAS FOSTERED AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE CAN BE FLOUTED WITH LITTLE FEAR OF SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM FROM CANBERRA.
806	SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A PROMINENT FORM OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. GIVEN THAT CREATING SOCIAL VALUE IS ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS, SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN TODAY'S ECONOMIC CLIMATE, CHARACTERISED BY A SEVERE GLOBAL CRISIS THAT HAS AFFECTED THE ROLE OF THE WELFARE STATE FOR A HOST OF ECONOMIC AGENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS HIGHLY ADVISABLE TO DEVISE MEASURES TO FOSTER SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY ADDRESSING THE KEY VARIABLES THAT DRIVE THIS ACTIVITY. THIS STUDY'S AIM WAS TO ANALYSE SOME OF THESE VARIABLES, NAMELY HUMAN CAPITAL AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION. TO ACHIEVE THIS AIM, THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN 29 COUNTRIES WAS STUDIED USING PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS) METHODOLOGY.
807	THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT LINK IN RESPONDING TO CHINA'S MARITIME STRATEGY AND THE "ONE BELT ONE ROAD INITIATIVE". IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING A GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL, WHILE GIVING FULL PLAY TO THE CHARACTERISTIC INDUSTRIES OF THE CITY, THE GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL'S INFLUENCE ON THE REGION AND THE WORLD WILL BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE GOVERNANCE OF THE GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL'S ECONOMY, RESOURCES, ECOLOGY, CULTURE, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER FIELDS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL, AS A SYSTEMATIC OCEAN GOVERNANCE METHOD INVOLVING MULTIPLE FIELDS, SHOULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THE STANDARDS OF GOOD OCEAN GOVERNANCE. THROUGH AN ASSESSMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OCEAN GOVERNANCE, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF CHINA'S GLOBAL MARITIME CAPITAL STILL ENTAILS FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF RULE OF LAW, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, AND RESPONSIVENESS TO NEW STANDARDS AND RULES.
808	THIS PAPER EXAMINES IN GENERAL TERMS THE IMPACT OF THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE ON COVID-19 LEGISLATION AND MANAGEMENT. IN ACADEMIC DISCUSSION THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE IS USUALLY REFERRED TO IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. THE PRINCIPLE CAN ALSO BE FOUND, HOWEVER, IN HEALTH PROTECTION, WHICH SUGGESTS ITS TRANSFER TO THE PANDEMIC SITUATION. CONTRARY TO THE CONCERN THAT THE PRINCIPLE COULD SERVE AS A BLANKET JUSTIFICATION FOR EXTREME AND ARBITRARY INTERVENTIONS IN CIVIL LIBERTIES, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING CONFLICTS WITH THE RULE-OF-LAW OBLIGATION TO EVIDENCE-BASED LEGISLATION, THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE DOES NOT SUPPLANT THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY. THUS, IT SETS LIMITS TO RISK-RELATED LEGISLATION EVEN THOUGH IT ALLOWS RESTRICTIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS. REFLECTING ON THE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ABOUT THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE CAN HELP TO MAINTAIN (OR AT LEAST RESTORE) RATIONALITY AND PRUDENT RISK TRADEOFFS EVEN IN TIMES OF EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.
809	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF PROMOTING THE COMMON GOOD AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO DEMON-STRATE HOW LAW SHOULD BE SEEN PRIMARILY TO A POSITIVE TASK (HUMAN FLOURISHING), AND TO SHOW HOW ENACTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS ARE STRICTLY CONNECTED, IT IS PRESENTED THE HYPOTHESIS IN WHICH THE "QUALITY OF THE FEDERATION" (ARRANGEMENT OF COMPETENCES, GOODS AND INCOMES DRAWN IN A FEDERAL RULE OF LAW) IS DETERMINANT IN SHAPING A LINEAR RELATION BETWEEN THE "ENDS ELECTED" BY A GIVEN COMMUNITY AND THE "MEANS PURPOSED" BY THE STATE ADMINISTRATION TO FULFILL THOSE ENDS. IN THIS SENSE, THE PAPER IS DIVIDED IN TWO SECTIONS, EACH ONE CONDUCTED FROM METHODOLOGY OF LITERARY REVIEW AND DATA ANALYSIS. THE FIRST SECTION DEALS WITH THE CONCEPT OF COMMON GOOD AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF USING INDICATORS TO MEASURE IT. THE SECOND SECTION TAKES THE EXAMPLE OF BRAZILIAN FEDERATION ARRANGEMENT DRAWN IN ITS CONSTITUTION TO DEMONSTRATE THE HYPOTHESIS. IN THE END, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BRAZIL LIVES A FALSE AUTONOMY AT THE MUNICIPALITIES LEVEL, AND THIS FALSE AUTONOMY CONSTITUTIONALLY DESIGNED CAN BE A CAUSE OF GENETIC PROBLEMS IN ACHIEVING A DYNAMIC OF THE COMMON GOOD.
810	JUDGES AND SCHOLARS OFTEN SPEAK ABOUT THE VERY SAME SUBJECT IN VERY DIFFERENT TERMS. JUDGES REGULARLY PROVIDE WRITTEN EXPLANATIONS OF THEIR RULINGS, AND SCHOLARS REGULARLY ARGUE THAT THE TRUE DETERMINANTS OF JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING LIE BEYOND THE WORDS OF THE JUDICIAL OPINION. THIS REVIEW ENGAGES LINES OF RESEARCH THAT TAKE THE FACT OF COMPETING JUDICIAL AND SCHOLARLY ACCOUNTS OF JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING AS THE SUBJECT OF STUDY. IN PARTICULAR, THIS REVIEW SURVEYS THREE DIFFERENT BODIES OF WORK THAT EXPLAIN THE ENDURING DIVIDE BETWEEN JUDGES AND SCHOLARS IN TERMS OF MOTIVATED REASONING, JUDICIAL CRISIS, AND THE CONTRADICTORY DEMANDS PLACED ON THE JUDICIAL PROCESS. THESE THREE LITERATURES PROVIDE WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT DISMISSING THE PERSPECTIVES OF EITHER JUDGES OR SCHOLARS.
811	IN THIS STUDY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOL GOVERNANCE AND SCHOOL CLIMATE WAS EXAMINED BASED ON TEACHERS' VIEWS. THIS RESEARCH CARRIED OUT WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF 375 TEACHERS IN KAYSERI (MELIKGAZI, KOCASINAN AND TALAS) IN 2016-2017 ACADEMIC YEAR, WAS A QUANTITATIVE STUDY. AS A DATA COLLECTION TOOL "SCHOOL GOVERNANCE SCALE" DEVELOPED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS STUDY WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE REALIZED AND THE TARGETED LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE IN THE SCHOOLS. FOR THE SCHOOL CLIMATE "SCHOOL CLIMATE SCALE" DEVELOPED BY HOY, SMITH AND SWEETLAND (2002) AND ADAPTED TO TURKISH WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS STUDY WAS USED. FOR THE RELIABILITY OF THE SCALES, THE CRONBACH ALPHA COEFFICIENT WAS EXAMINED. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING T-TEST, ANOVA AND LSD TEST IN POST HOC TESTS, PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SCHOOL GOVERNANCE IS REALIZED AT MEDIUM LEVEL IN SCHOOLS AND IT IS TARGETED AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL. ALSO, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REALIZED AND THE TARGETED LEVEL OF SCHOOL GOVERNANCE WAS OBSERVED. A POSITIVE MODERATE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN SCHOOL GOVERNANCE AND SCHOOL CLIMATE DIMENSIONS. SCHOOL GOVERNANCE'S RULE OF LAW AND PARTICIPATION DIMENSIONS WERE FOUND AS SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF SCHOOL CLIMATE WHILE TRANSPARENCY DIMENSION WAS NOT FOUND TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR.
812	THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FREE TRADE EXPERIMENTAL ZONE IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR CHINA TO ACTIVELY DEAL WITH THE COMPLICATED INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT, COMPREHENSIVELY DEEPEN DOMESTIC REFORMS AND BUILD A NEW OPEN ECONOMIC SYSTEM. THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL SECURITY PREVENTION AND CONTROL SYSTEM IN THE SHIPPING FIELD HAS ITS PARTICULARITY. ONLY BY IDENTIFYING THE BREAKTHROUGH POINT AND FOCAL POINT CAN IT ACHIEVE TWICE THE RESULT WITH HALF THE EFFORT. IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE JUDICIAL SERVICE AND GUARANTEE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FREE TRADE EXPERIMENTAL ZONE AND THE FREE TRADE PORT WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE FREE TRADE EXPERIMENTAL ZONE, THE SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT ISSUED THE "OPINIONS ON PROVIDING JUDICIAL SERVICE AND GUARANTEE FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE DEEPENING OF REFORM AND OPENING-UP IN THE FREE TRADE EXPERIMENTAL ZONE" IN A TIMELY MANNER, DEFINING THE OBJECTIVES AND TASKS AND PUTTING FORWARD SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS. IT IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO EXPLORE AND BUILD A FREE TRADE PORT WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, AND CREATE A NEW OPEN HIGHLAND WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF OPENING, BETTER BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND STRONGER RADIATION EFFECT FOR PROMOTING THE INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN ECONOMY. THE PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE SHOULD CARRY OUT A MORE ACTIVE OPENING STRATEGY, ACCELERATE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW SYSTEM OF THE PATH OF RULE OF LAW, AND EXPLORE REPLICABLE AND GENERALIZABLE EXPERIENCES FOR THE NATIONAL REFORM AND OPENING UP.
813	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY OF THE STATE AND LAW TEACHING IN UNIVERSITIES, TO QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A RIGHT TO MAKE THE LAST MISTAKE, WHICH SUPPOSEDLY WOULD BELONG TO THE SUPREME FEDERAL COURT IN BRAZIL. JUDICIAL DECISIONS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO ACADEMIC CRITICISM, WHICH MAY POINT OUT THEIR MISTAKES AND ACHIEVEMENTS. UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR JUDICIAL DECISIONS IS UNDENIABLE, NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS CORRECT. AS HUMAN BEINGS, JUDGES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED INFALLIBLE. ON THE ONE HAND, IT IS UP TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE DISPUTES; ON THE OTHER, LAW SCHOOLS SHOULD REINVIGORATE THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW.
814	BEYOND WHAT WE THINK AND KNOW ABOUT THE STATE AND ITS FUNCTIONS, SOCIAL POLICIES HAVE BEEN A CORNERSTONE FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY AND INEQUALITY TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMY CONDITIONS. SOCIAL RIGHTS GRANTED BY THE RULE OF LAW HAVE ALLOWED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO TRANSFORM THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STRUCTURE IN EQUALITY AND COMMON WELFARE. OCCUPATION, SOCIAL MANAGEMENT, MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND STRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY ARE COMMON FACTORS IN THE ANALYSIS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S OWN ACTIONS. THE COMBINATION IN THE ANALYSIS OF SUCH FACTORS GIVES, AS A RESULT A RANGE OF PROPOSALS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE.
815	WE DEFINE THE INTERNAL MARKET OF A REGIONAL INTEGRATION AGREEMENT AS A LEGAL ORDER THAT IS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. A REGIONAL INTEGRATION AGREEMENT IS A PARTICULAR CASE OF MARKET BUILDING IN THAT IT CREATES A NEW MARKET WITH NEW RULES. THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS IS ESSENTIAL. A KEY ISSUE CONSISTS IN VERIFYING THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IS POSSIBLE AS WELL AS ADAPTING THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION. IN COMPARING THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS, WE RELY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A SHARED GOAL CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS THAT CONSIDER THE STARTING POINT OF PARTICIPATING STATES. IN TERMS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS, WE CONSIDER THE POSSIBLE ABSENCE OF CENTRALIZED POWERS.
816	DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, ALL THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN REFORMING THEIR JUDICIAL SYSTEMS UNDER EUROPE'S INFLUENCE, EXERTED THROUGHOUT THE ENLARGEMENT PROCESS. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE JUDICIAL REFORM PATHS AND TRAJECTORIES IN FOUR COUNTRIES OF THIS AREA: SLOVENIA, CROATIA, ROMANIA AND SERBIA. IN EACH COUNTRY, IN FACT, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU'S LEVERAGE WAS CONDITIONED BY SOME INTRINSIC PROPERTIES OF EU CONDITIONALITY (NAMELY, CREDIBILITY OF THE MEMBERSHIP PROSPECTIVE AND DETERMINACY OF THE EU'S RECOMMENDATIONS). MOREOVER, SOME DOMESTIC FACTORS AND CONDITIONS COINCIDED TO STRENGTHEN (OR CONTRARILY, TO HAMPER) THE EFFICACY OF THE EU'S INFLUENCE AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. AFTER REVIEWING THE MAIN THEORETICAL APPROACHES USED TO STUDY EU-DRIVEN JUDICIAL REFORMS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO IDENTIFY SOME EXPLANATORY FACTORS AND CONDITIONS THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE REFORM PATHS AND OUTCOMES IN THE FOUR CASE STUDIES. IN CONCLUSION, SOME REFLECTIONS ON CURRENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES TO THE EU RULE OF LAW PROMOTION STRATEGY WILL BE PRESENTED.
817	THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO REITERATE FROM THE THEORETICAL AND ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTIONS THE IMPACT THAT SUPPOSED THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS THAT ALLOWS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DEMOCRATIC MODEL HAVING AS CENTRAL THE HUMAN, THEIR NEEDS AND DIGNITY AS THE SUPREME VALUE OF BEING BORN ALL OTHER FREEDOMS. A DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGY TO ACCURATELY COLLECT THE DIFFERENT THEORETICAL PROPOSALS ABOUT THE ABOVE TWO PREMISES RAISED IS PROPOSED. THE IDEAS AND THEORETICAL HERE ADDRESSED AND RESUMED DISCUSSIONS ARE THE RESULT OF THE RESEARCH PERFORMANCE OF ACADEMIC NATURE OF SEEDLING HUMAN LAW ST. THOMAS UNIVERSITY - MEDELLIN WITHIN THE PROJECT " INCORPORATION OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS IN JUDGMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ON SOCIAL RIGHTS AS A TREND TOWARDS RECOGNITION OF DESC AS AUTONOMOUS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT."
818	SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. MANY OF THESE NEWLY INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES ARE SMALL BOTH IN TERMS OF POPULATION AND GEOGRAPHY, AND SEVERAL ARE ISLANDS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF ISLAND STATUS AND COUNTRY SIZE ON INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND TO DETERMINE IF THESE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS CAN EXPLAIN THE RELATIVELY STRONG ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF ISLANDS AND SMALL COUNTRIES. I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS (DEMOCRACY) AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS (RULE OF LAW). ONE OF THE MAIN FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAND STATUS AND INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE, AND THAT THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO THE INCLUSION OF A NUMBER OF CONTROL VARIABLES. FURTHER, I FIND THAT COUNTRY SIZE IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, WHICH IS IN KEEPING WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNT FOR THESE COUNTRIES' RELATIVELY BETTER ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS 42 (1) (2014) 34-60.

819	THIS ARTICLE TO ANALYZE THE SINGULAR ASPECTS OF THE POLITICAL-CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION OF BRAZIL BETWEEN THE DECADE OF THE SIXTIES UP TO THE PRESENT PERIOD. SUBJECTS LIKE THE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, THE JUDICIAL POWER, THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE POLITICAL PARTIES, THE DEFENCE MECHANISMS OF THE CONSTITUTION, WILL BE DEALT WITH, AND ADVANCES AND THEATS TO THE DEMOCRACY. WE WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION OF 1988 WHEN ESTABLISHING THAT THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL IS CONSTITUTED IN DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, INAUGURATING A NEW ERA IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM BREAKING THE AUTHORITARIAN CYCLE THAT DOMINATED THE COUNTRY DURING 1964 UNTIL HALF-FULL OF DECADE OF 80. IN SHORT, OUR OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO DEMOSTRATE AS THEY ARE THE MAIN ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF THE BRAZILKIAN POLICITAL-CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.
820	THIS ARTICLE HAS FOR OBJECTIVE TO EVALUATE THE TAXATION ON THE CONSUMPTION IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE AND TO VERIFY IF IT ASSISTS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE INDIVIDUALITY, WHICH IS ONE OF THE ADAPTATION PILLARS OF THE COLLECTION TO THE DEMANDS OF THE DEMOCRATIC STATE OF RIGHT. IN IT IS DEVELOPMENT THE TAXATION ON THE CONSUMPTION IS ANALYZED UNDER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FORM AS THESE TRIBUTES ARE STRUCTURED IN THE BRAZILIAN LEGAL SYSTEM, DISRESPECTING THE TAXPAYER'S PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES, HAS NO CONSONANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT ADVISORS OF THE TAX SYSTEM. THE OPTION OF THE BRAZILIAN STATE IN CONCENTRATING THE COLLECTION IN THE TAXATION ON THE CONSUMPTION OFFENDS TO THE FOUNDATIONS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW INSTITUTED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF 1988, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO CITIZENSHIP AND THE CONSTITUTION OF A FAIR AND SOLIDARY SOCIETY, BECAUSE THAT INCIDENCE FORM IS NOT MEASURED CONSIDERING THE MANIFESTATION OF THE FINAL CONSUMER'S WEALTH.
821	THIS RESPONSE TO YEUNG EXPLORES THE POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE NEW PUBLIC ANALYTICS, IN RELATION TO THE THEORY OF 'ORDERS OF WORTH'. FIRMS ENGAGING IN NPA ENTER INTO BOTH ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL COMMITMENTS WITH REGARD TO THEIR ACTIVITIES WHICH IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC. THIS COMMENTARY IDENTIFIES MISSING STANDARDS FOR WHAT CONSTITUTES ACCEPTABLE INVOLVEMENT BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN FACILITATING, AND SETTING THE PARAMETERS FOR, INTERVENTIONS ON THE PUBLIC. I ARGUE THAT IN LARGE-SCALE INTERVENTIONS ON THE NATIONAL OR TRANSNATIONAL SCALE, A CONFLATION OF PUBLIC WITH COMMERCIAL AIMS AND VALUES IS OCCURRING WHICH REQUIRES A RETHINKING OF THE NOTION OF PROCUREMENT, BUT ALSO OF REGULATION. THE ENGAGEMENTS OCCURRING UNDER THE DEFINITION OF NPA RAISE THE QUESTION OF RULE OF LAW IN NEW WAYS. TO WHOM SHOULD REGULATION APPLY AND AT WHAT POINT DOES A COMMERCIAL FIRM BECOME DEFINED AS A PUBLIC -SECTOR ACTOR? HOW ARE FIRMS ESCAPING THIS DEFINITION, AND WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE TO THIS ESCAPE FROM SCRUTINY AND REGULATION IS APPROPRIATE?
822	EMERGENCY PUBLIC PROCUREMENT DURING THE COVID-19 HEALTH CRISIS HAS BEEN A RESOURCEFUL INSTRUMENT TO PROVIDE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO PUBLIC NEEDS BY THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS. THE STATES HAVE DEVELOPED DIFFERENT EMERGENCY LEGISLATION AND MEASURES TO RESOLVE A CRISIS, AS BOTH THE SPANISH AND MEXICAN CASES DEMONSTRATE. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EMERGENCY PUBLIC CONTRACT SHOWS SOME RISKS SUCH AS WEAKNESS IN THE LEGAL BASES AND EMERGENCY REASONING, A DISPROPORTIONATE USE OR A DEFICIENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL THAT CAN AFFECT THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES RELATED TO PROCUREMENT. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THE EXISTENCE OF DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF THE CONCEPT, NATURE, AND REQUIREMENTS OF EMERGENCY PUBLIC PROCUREMENT. BASED ON ANTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS MUST BE PREPARED TO USE STRATEGIC PUBLIC PROCUREMENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN TIMES A CONTEXT OF CRISIS.
823	LEGAL CERTAINTY IS A CENTRAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL SYSTEMS SHOULD BOTH ENABLE THOSE SUBJECT TO LAW TO PREDICT HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND INSTITUTIONAL REACTIONS AND TO PREVENT AN ARBITRARY USE OF STATE POWER AGAINST THEM. THE VALUE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS USUALLY CONCEIVED AS A FORMAL VALUE OPPOSED TO THE VALUES OF FREEDOM OR EQUALITY (MATERIAL OR SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE). THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS THIS IDEA AND TO EXPLORE A LESS FORMAL CONCEPTION OF THE VALUE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY. IN THIS SENSE, I WILL ARGUE THAT WE NEED TO DEPART FROM A PURELY FORMAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY SUCH VALUE AND TO CONSIDER THE NEED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT. SO, LEGAL CERTAINTY IS NOT COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF LEGAL SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE AND IT IMPLIES THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE EX ANTE WHICH CONCRETE ASPECTS OF JUSTICE SHOULD NOT BE THE LAW'S CONCERN.
824	CHINA'S SOCIALIST MARKET ECONOMY IS A MARKET ECONOMY CO-EXISTING WITH A LARGE PUBLIC SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY, AFFECTED BY THE STATE AS A POLICYMAKER, A REGULATOR AND AN IMPORTANT ACTOR ALONG WITH PRIVATE ONES; GENERAL INTERESTS IN PRINCIPLE PREVAIL OVER INDIVIDUAL ONES. A MAJOR ROLE OF THE LAW IS OF PROVIDING THE TOOLS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERSHIP AND EFFICIENT MACRO-CONTROL. LEGAL AND POLICY DOCUMENTS CONCUR IN INDICATING A MODEL FOR THE DEVELOPING CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM: NOT AS WESTERN-STYLE "RULE OF LAW" (R.O.L.); MORE AND BETTER SOCIALIST LAWS; EFFECTIVE SUPERVISION AT ALL LEVELS; INTENSE MACRO-CONTROL OVER PRIVATE ECONOMY; MORE EFFICIENT, LAW-ABIDING ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. THE GOVERNING AUTHORITIES ARE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS, ACCORDING TO THE SIZE/IMPACT OF EACH SPECIFIC BUSINESS, AND EACH OF THEM HAS OR MAY HAVE A SAY BEYOND THE LAW, SO IMPLEMENTING FULL MACRO-AND MICRO-CONTROL ON THE MARKET AT VARIOUS LEVELS, THROUGH A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF "POLICY CHECKS" AT APPROPRIATE JUNCTIONS OR IN BLANK AREAS OF THE LAW. DIFFERENTIATED "MODES" OF THE LAW COULD BE THE RESULTS OF A COORDINATED ABSORPTION WITHIN THE SOCIALIST FRAME OF VALUES, MECHANISMS, NORMS, FORMANTS HAILING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.
825	THE INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE REGIME VIEWS AS AN EXCEPTION THE LARGE NUMBER OF STATES (BOTH HOSTING AND PRODUCING MUCH OF THE GLOBAL REFUGEE POPULATION) THAT ARE NOT PARTY TO ITS CORNERSTONE TREATY. THIS APPROACH DIMINISHES THE ROLE OF LAW, THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN REFUGEE PROTECTION IN A BROAD SWATHE OF STATES ENCOMPASSING MUCH OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO TREATING THIS PART OF THE WORLD AS A ZONE OF EXCEPTION TO REFUGEE LAW IS TO BASE LEGAL INTERVENTIONS ON A VARIABLE AND PLURALISTIC 'LAW OF ASYLUM'. THIS APPROACH HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND PROVIDES NEW AVENUES FOR LEGAL ENGAGEMENT, EVEN IN JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY SEEN AS WEAK IN THE RULE OF LAW OR WITHOUT THE REQUISITE COMMITMENT TO THE NORMS OF REFUGEE LAW.
826	OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS SINCE THE LAUNCH OF REFORM AND OPENING UP IN 1978, CHINA HAS PASSED THROUGH THREE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES: RECOVERY, STABILITY AND FLOURISHING GROWTH. THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS REVOLVED AROUND THE AXIS OF "POLITICSRULE BY LAWRULE OF LAW RULE OF LAW SYSTEMRULE OF LAW PATHRULE OF LAW CHINA." BY VIRTUE OF DISCUSSION OF THE CORE THEMES OF JURISPRUDENCE AND BASIC CATEGORIES, JURISPRUDENCE HAS MOUNTED EVER HIGHER. ON THE BASIS OF SUMMING UP EXISTING EXPERIENCE, THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS OF CHINESE JURISPRUDENCE IN THE NEW ERA SHOULD FIRMLY UPHOLD A DISCIPLINARY ORIENTATION, AN INDIGENOUS ORIENTATION, A MASS ORIENTATION AND AN ORIENTATION TOWARD PRACTICE AND MODERNIZATION. WE MUST SEEK NEW LOGICAL STARTING POINTS, CONSTANTLY PIONEER AND INNOVATE, AND CONTRIBUTE NEW WISDOM AND PROGRAMS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE GOVERNANCE OF THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO LAW.
827	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO ANALYZE THE CURRENT PROGRESS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH THE PERUVIAN MINING AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE ECONOMIC AND NATURAL RESOURCES AS AN IDEAL MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE MINING SECTOR. FIRST, WE PRESENT THE IMPORTANCE OF MINING IN THE PERUVIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS A SOURCE OF WEALTH. SOON AFTER, WE QUESTION WHAT IS DELIMITED ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT WITH GENERAL SCOPE. WE CONCLUDE THAT MINERAL RESOURCES WERE, ARE AND WILL BE THE NATURAL RESOURCES MOST RESEARCHED BY ECONOMIC AGENTS OF THE MINING SECTOR IN PERU, BUT THE SOCIAL OBJECTIVITY BY MINING STILL FITS ON UNSUSTAINABLE EXPLOITATION OF ITS HIGH DEGREE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND GENERATION OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS. IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE BENEFITS AND EARNINGS FROM MINING ARE NOT VISIBLE BY THE SOCIETY YET AND WONDERS WHETHER THE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE UP THE PERUVIAN LIBERAL ECONOMIC ORDER SHOULD BE HARMONIZED ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF A SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW.
828	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE DEVELOPMENT OF KIDNAPPING IN MEXICO CITY. NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS CRIME HAS EVOLVED FROM A CRIME THAT UNTIL RECENTLY TARGETED MOSTLY THE WEALTHY TO ONE THAT NOW TARGETS MAINLY MIDDLE-AND WORKING-CLASS INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS COUNTERINTUITIVE SINCE, ARGUABLY, KIDNAPPING IS A COSTLY CRIME TO PLAN AND EXECUTE AND IS THUS BETTER SUITED FOR A ONCE-OFF LARGE PAYOFF. TYPICAL EXPLANATIONS OF HIGH CRIME RATES AND OTHER CRIMINAL PHENOMENA IN LATIN AMERICA ARGUE THAT EITHER A WEAK STATE OR VERY POWERFUL CRIMINALS EXPLAIN HIGH LEVELS OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE. I ARGUE FOR A MIDDLE-GROUND APPROACH THAT LOOKS AT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STATE, CRIMINALS AND SOCIETY TO EXPLAIN THE CHANGES MENTIONED. USING QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE, I EXPLAIN THIS SHIFT IN KIDNAPPING ALONG THREE LINES: (1) THE SUCCESSFUL DESTRUCTION BY THE STATE OF OLDER, SOPHISTICATED KIDNAPPING GANGS; (2) THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL STRATEGIES THAT WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM CRIME; AND (3) THE FAILURE OF THE STATE TO IMPOSE A STRONG RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY REFLECTING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DEEP STRUCTURAL REFORM AS A WAY TO ASSURE LONG-LASTING DROPS IN CRIME.
829	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE LEGACY OF POLITICAL DISSENT IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES AND ITS IMPACT ON POST-COMMUNIST POLITICAL AND LEGAL TRANSFORMATIONS. THE FIRST PART DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF COMMUNIST POLITICS AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF 'SOCIALIST LEGALITY.' IN THE FOLLOWING PART, THE DISSIDENT ARGUMENTATIVE BLEND OF LEGALISM AND NATURAL RIGHTS WILL BE ANALYSED AS BOTH A CRITIQUE OF THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM AND A STRUCTURAL PRECONDITION OF POST-COMMUNIST CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL TRANSFORMATIONS. THE FINAL PART WILL FOCUS ON HOW THE POLITICAL DISSENT IN COMMUNIST COUNTRIES SYMBOLISED VIRTUES OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC POLITICS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AND INFLUENCED THE EMERGING CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS BASED ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
830	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CURRENT DEBATE BETWEEN POPULIST AND REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTS OF DEMOCRACY. TO TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY IS INEVITABLY TO TALK ABOUT THE IDEA OF A PEOPLE AND ITS POWER. FROM THE BEGINNINGS OF THE WESTERN POLITICAL TRADITION, 'THE PEOPLE' HAS REFERRED TO BOTH A CONSTITUTED PART OF SOCIETY (POPULUS) AND TO A PART EXCLUDED FROM POLITICAL SOCIETY (PLEBS). THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULISM AND REPUBLICANISM IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THESE TWO PARTS RELATE TO EACH OTHER, AND THE RESULTING CONCEPTIONS OF THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. FOR POPULISM, THE PEOPLE HAVE POWER WHEN THE PLEBS ACHIEVES HEGEMONY WITHIN THE POPULUS BY WRESTING CONTROL OF THE STATE FROM THE 'WEALTHY' ELITES. ACCORDING TO THE ALTERNATIVE REPUBLICAN ACCOUNT DEVELOPED IN THIS ARTICLE, INSTEAD, THE PEOPLE HAVE POWER WHEN THE PLEBS INSCRIBES WITHIN THE STATE THE POSSIBILITY OF ABOLISHING RELATIONS OF RULE. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS OF POPULAR POWER IS PURSUED IN TERMS OF THE OPPOSING ATTITUDES THAT POPULISM AND REPUBLICANISM HAVE IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO RAISES A HYPOTHESIS AS TO THE HISTORICAL REASONS FOR THESE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN POPULISM AND REPUBLICANISM BY EXAMINING THREE HISTORICAL MOMENTS, WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLEBEIAN POLITICS: THE EARLY ROMAN REPUBLIC, THE AUGUSTINIAN FOUNDATION OF A CHRISTIAN REPUBLIC AND THE CRISIS OF GUILD REPUBLICANISM IN MACHIAVELLI'S AGE. CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY (2012) 11, 242-263. DOI:10.1057/CPT.2011.25; PUBLISHED ONLINE 11 OCTOBER 2011
831	IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE FOR A RULE-OF-LAW-READING OF ULRIK HUBER'S FUNDAMENTAL LAW ON FREEDOM OF PROPERTY. MY AIM IS TO SHOW THAT THERE IS ENOUGH CONTEMPORARY INTELLECTUAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT FOR SUCH A READING. I DO SO BY ARGUING ALONG THREE LINES: THE MEDIEVAL TRADITION THAT ROOTED THE ORIGIN OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN NATURAL LAW, PROTECTION OF PROPERTY IN THE CONSTITUTION OF HOLLAND IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTED BY FUNDAMENTAL LAW IN ENGLISH COMMON LAW.
832	THIS PAPER TRIES TO QUESTION ONE WELL ESTABLISHED REPRESENTATION WHICH ESCAPES THE CRITICAL APPROACH OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORIOGRAPHY, THE IDEA THAT THE DOMINANT THEORY OF LAW AND SERBIAN STATE DURING THE SO CALLED "GOLDEN AGE OF SERBIAN DEMOCRACY", FOLLOWED ACCURATELY THE STRAIGHT LINE OF POLITICAL LIBERALISM IN THE MODERN MEANING. PRECISELY, THE SERBIAN RULE OF LAW AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, IS NOT, OR NOT ONLY A "RULE OF LAW", BUT FIRST OF ALL, FAITH IN THE STRONG HEGELIAN STATE AS SUPPOSEDLY NEUTRAL AND HIGHLY RATIONALIZED IDENTITY. NEVERTHELESS OF THE STATE IS THE ONLY GUARANTY AGAINST THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF IRRATIONAL FACTORS IN POLITICS, WHATEVER THEIR ORIGINS, DESPOTISM OF AN ABSOLUTE PRINCE OR OF NON EDUCATED PEOPLE, IT IS BECAUSE ITS RATIONALITY IS ASSURED BY THE ELITIST COMPONENTS OF ITS CONSTITUTION, LIBERAL BUT NO DEMOCRATIC. AS IT DEPENDS ON ITS LEGAL NORMATIVISM, IT DEPENDS EXCLUSIVELY ON ITS STATE ORIGIN, WHATEVER THE OPINION OF ITS ADDRESSEES OR OF THE CONCERNED POPULATION.
833	WE STUDY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) EXPANDED THE EUROPEAN UNION'S REACH INTO ISSUES OF NATIONAL JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE ECJ'S 2018 RULING IN A CASE KNOWN AS PORTUGUESE JUDGES CONTAINED A FAR-REACHING CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION THAT HAD A TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT ON THE EUROPEAN UNION'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS. WE CONDUCT A THEORETICALLY GUIDED INVESTIGATION INTO BOTH THE DOMESTIC ORIGINS AND THE JUDICIAL OUTCOME IN THE PORTUGUESE JUDGES CASE. WE SHOW HOW THE ECJ, WITH IMPLICIT SUPPORT FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBER STATES, STRATEGICALLY EXPLOITED SUITABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN INCONSPICUOUS CASE TO PRODUCE A LANDMARK RULING THAT ENABLED UNPRECEDENTED ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN POLAND AND HUNGARY.
834	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE EVOLUTION OF DEMAND FOR DIFFERENTIATION IN POLAND. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT SINCE EU ACCESSION POLAND HAS MOVED FROM INSTRUMENTAL TOWARDS QUASI-CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENTIATED INTEGRATION, AND TOWARDS DIFFERENTIATED DISINTEGRATION DE FACTO. SECOND, IT CONCEPTUALIZES NON-COMPLIANCE IN THE RULE OF LAW AREA AS A MANIFESTATION OF DIFFERENTIATED DISINTEGRATION DE FACTO UNDERSTOOD AS POLITY-RELATED DELIBERATE AND ENDURING CIRCUMVENTION OF EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THIRD, IT ARGUES THAT THIS MODE OF DE FACTO DIFFERENTIATION CONSTITUTES A CHALLENGER STRATEGY OF POLAND'S POPULISTS IN POWER AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN POLITY. ACCORDINGLY, THE POLISH CASE PROVIDES AN ILLUSTRATION OF 'POST-FUNCTIONALISM REVERSED': IT IS NOT A EUROSCEPTIC PUBLIC THAT CONSTRAINS A PRO-INTEGRATIONIST GOVERNMENT, BUT A EUROSCEPTIC GOVERNMENT THAT DRIVES DIFFERENTIATION AND DISINTEGRATION WITHOUT EXPLICIT SUPPORT FROM THE LARGELY PRO-INTEGRATIONIST PUBLIC.
835	IN THE FOLLOWING LINES, REBUILDS RELEVANT HISTORICAL ELEMENTS THAT INFLUENCED NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM CONSOLIDATION AND DISCUSSES SOME NOTABLE FOUNDATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE FIRST GENERATION, WITH ALL ITS VARIATIONS AND CHANGES OF HUE, SO THE RECOGNITION AND STATE PROTECTION OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND ORDERING PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE, AS AN ORDER STRUCTURING ELEMENTS ADAPTED TO REALITY. NEOCONSTITUTIONALISM IS ULTIMATELY APPEAL TO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF THE HUMAN BEING, WHOSE REALITY IS DRIVEN BY A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WHICH IS BASED ON LEGAL INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE CONTROL OF CONSTITUTIONALITY, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN THE SEARCH FOR RESPECT FOR DIFFERENCE AND THE REALIZATION OF THE BASIC RIGHTS OF MINORITIES.
836	THE EXTINCTION REBELLION PROTESTS OF 2019 AND 2020 RESULTED IN PEACEFUL PROTESTERS BEING CHARGED FOR A RANGE OF MINOR, NON-VIOLENT CRIMINAL OFFENCES. THE DEFENCE TO THOSE CHARGES IS NECESSITY, A DEFENCE TIGHTLY RESTRICTED IN ITS USE BY THE COURTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF MINOR CRIMINAL OFFENCES COMMITTED DURING ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL WARMING (AGW) PROTESTS, NECESSITY MUST BE RECONCEPTUALISED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SO GIVEN THE GROWING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF THAT DEFENCE IN AGW PROTEST MATTERS, THE INCREASING STATE PROHIBITION ON PROTEST AND THE UNIQUE MANNER IN WHICH AGW PROTESTS SUBVERT THE STRICT APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
837	IN CENTRAL EUROPE, ESPECIALLY IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, OVER THE LAST YEARS THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS RELATED TO DEMOCRACY, CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN A SHORT TIME, THE ILLIBERAL POLITICAL LEADERS PUT INTO PRACTICE AN ORDER THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION PRINCIPLES THAT FORM PART OF THE AXIOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY ILLIBERALISM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REGION AND WHICH TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED TO REINFORCE THE POLITICAL CAPTURE OF VARIOUS STATE INSTITUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THE JUDICIARY. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONTAINS A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS HUNGARIAN AND POLISH ILLIBERALISM. THE GENERAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY IS THAT HUNGARY AND POLAND HAVE GONE SO FAR TOWARDS CONSTITUTIONAL ILLIBERALISM, THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO INDICATE THE SIMPLE LEGAL REMEDIES FOR RAPID RETURN OF THESE COUNTRIES TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
838	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY (GDP) IN 19 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE) COUNTRIES, COVERING THE PERIOD 1999-2016. WE UTILISE PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO CONSTRUCT A HYBRID MEASURE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND THE RANDOM EFFECT MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE CAUSALITIES. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT MANY CEE COUNTRIES HAVE IMPROVED THEIR INSTITUTIONAL SETTING, ESPECIALLY THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE REGRESSION RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION AND DEMOCRACY HAVE A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE GDP. ALSO, POLITICAL STABILITY PROMOTES GROWTH, WHILE THE QUALITY OF REGULATION IS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. FINALLY, THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM ACCELERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. OVERALL, THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM SHAPE THE ECONOMIC REALITY IN THE CEE REGION. WE CONCLUDE THAT INSTITUTIONS MATTER FOR GROWTH IN THE CEE COUNTRIES.
839	THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE TERMS OF THE JUDICIAL OATH SWORN BY THE JUDGES IN THE ATHENIAN COURTS DURING THE CLASSICAL PERIOD. THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE OATH CONTAINED FOUR BASIC CLAUSES: (1) TO VOTE IN ACCORDANCE TO THE LAWS AND DECREES OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE, (2) TO VOTE ABOUT MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE, (3) TO LISTEN TO BOTH THE ACCUSER(S) AND DEFENDANT(S) EQUALLY, AND (4) TO VOTE OR JUDGE (DIKASEIN) WITH ONE'S MOST FAIR JUDGMENT (DIKAIOTATE GNOME). SOME SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT THE FOURTH CLAUSE GAVE JUDGES THE RIGHT TO VOTE ACCORDING TO THEIR CONSCIENCE AND TO IGNORE THE LAW IF THEY FOUND IT UNJUST. THE FIRST PART OF THE ESSAY SHOWS THAT THIS CLAUSE GAVE JUDGES THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MOST JUST JUDGMENT ONLY WHERE THE LAWS GAVE NO CLEAR GUIDANCE. IT WAS A DEFAULT CLAUSE INVOKED ONLY TWICE IN THE EXTANT ORATIONS; IT WAS NEVER USED AS JUSTIFICATION TO IGNORE THE WRITTEN LAWS. THE SECOND PART ADDRESSES THE VIEW THAT THE COURTS TOOK POLITICAL FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT DURING TRIALS. ALTHOUGH SOME TRIALS INVOLVED LEADING POLITICIANS, THE COURTS WERE BOUND BY THEIR OATH TO DECIDE WHETHER THE DEFENDANT WAS GUILTY OF THE CHARGE BROUGHT BY THE ACCUSER. THE ONLY PART OF A TRIAL WHERE A DEFENDANT MIGHT MENTION HIS POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OR HIS PUBLIC LARGESSE WAS AT DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PENALTY (TIMESIS) IN A TRIAL ON A PUBLIC CHARGE (GRAPHE).
840	WHETHER TRYING TO DEBUNK THE LAW'S PRETENSIONS TO AUTHORITY, OR CONSTRUCTING A GENERAL THEORY OF LAW, LEGAL POSITIVISTS HAVE SPENT AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME FOCUSING ON MORALLY INADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND TAILORING THEIR THEORIES TO FIT THOSE REGIMES. THEIR OBSESSION WITH THE NAZIS AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL, HOWEVER, HAS BLINDED THEM TO A BASIC JURISPRUDENTIAL TRUTH: A WICKED REGIME IS A BOTCHED LEGAL SYSTEM, MUCH AS 'THE EARTH IS FLAT' IS A FAILED SCIENTIFIC THEORY.
841	IN RECENT YEARS, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN HUNGARY, POLAND AND AUSTRIA HAVE CONTESTED THE AUTHORITY OF THE EU IN AREAS LINKED TO CORE STATE POWERS, SUCH AS DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND MIGRATIONS. ANALYZING THE DISCURSIVE STRATEGIES DISPLAYED BY CONSERVATIVE AND/OR RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENTS IN THESE COUNTRIES, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE OLD CONFLICT LINE OVER SOVEREIGNTY THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY SHAPED THE INTEGRATION PROCESS ? SUPRANATIONAL VS DOMESTIC SOVEREIGNTY ? IS BEING COMPLEMENTED BY A NEW DISCOURSE WHICH CONSISTS IN DISPARAGING EU ?INTERFERENCE? IN THE VERY NAME OF EUROPEAN VALUES AND A COMMON EUROPEAN IDENTITY, DEFINED IN OPPOSITION TO MULTICULTURALISM AND POLITICAL LIBERALISM. PIONEERED BY VIKTOR ORBAN, THIS DISCOURSE HAS BEEN CIRCULATING AMONG OTHER CENTRAL EUROPEAN HEADS OF GOVERNMENT AND INCUMBENT PARTIES? OFFICIALS IN THE WAKE OF THE REFUGEE ?CRISIS?, WHICH OPENED UP A DISCURSIVE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE FOR ITS DIFFUSION.
842	SCHOLARLY ATTENTION HAS INCREASINGLY SHIFTED FROM DIMINISHED SUBTYPES OF DEMOCRACY TO HYBRID REGIMES, PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIANISM. SUCH REGIMES RETAIN DEMOCRACY'S FORMAL FEATURES WHILE FAILING TO MEET ITS MINIMUM STANDARDS. WHEN PROPERTIES OF DISTINCT CONCEPTS LIKE DEMOCRACY AND AUTHORITARIANISM ARE COMBINED, HOWEVER, CONFUSION, INACCURACY, AND MISCHARACTERIZATION OF CASES MAY OCCUR. BY DISAGGREGATING POLITICAL SYSTEMS INTO ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS, SURROUNDING RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE COMPLICATES THE BINARY DISTINCTION BETWEEN A MIDRANGE DEFINITION OF DEMOCRACY AND COMPETITIVE AUTHORITARIANISM. A NUMBER OF ANDEAN CASES ARE FOUND TO FALL ON THE SPECTRUM OF DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES BETWEEN THESE CATEGORIES. DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES BREAK DOWN WHEN RULERS VIOLATE THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR INSTITUTIONALIZED ALTERNATION IN POWER BY MEANS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND LOYAL OPPOSITION IN AN ELECTORAL REGIME. GIVEN LEADERS' RELIANCE ON ELECTORAL LEGITIMACY, HOWEVER, EVEN DEFECTIVE DEMOCRACIES MAY PROVE SURPRISINGLY RESILIENT.
843	THE SUMMER OF 2012 MARKED THE FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HANDOVER OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER HONG KONG FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. UNDER THE "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" PRINCIPLE ESTABLISHED IN THE HANDOVER AGREEMENTS, HONG KONG WAS PERMITTED TO RETAIN A "HIGH DEGREE OF AUTONOMY" AND THE EXISTING JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS TO BE MAINTAINED. FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE HANDOVER, JUSTICE KEMAL BOKHARY SAT ON HONG KONG'S HIGHEST COURT-THE COURT OF FINAL APPEAL. IN THIS ESSAY, ORIGINALLY OFFERED AS REMARKS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, JUSTICE BOKHARY REVIEWS HONG KONG'S JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS, DESCRIBES THE CHALLENGES IT CURRENTLY FACES AND PROVIDES HIS ASSESSMENT OF ITS FUTURE.
844	DETERMINING THE VALUES EMBODIED IN THE SOCIAL IDEAL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONDITIONS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. SOCIAL IDEALS REFLECT THE CONTRADICTIONS OF REALITY AND ITS DISSATISFIED NEEDS. SOCIAL CONFLICTS ARE SOLVED BY USING THE CONCEPT OF AN IDEAL SOCIAL ORDER, WHILE THE ABSENCE OF THE REGULATORY IDEAL OF SOCIAL IDEAS LEADS TO UNSYSTEMATIC ACTIONS OF SOCIAL ACTORS. ONE OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE IS THE LACK OF SOCIAL IDEOLOGY AND GENERAL DEFINITION OF LONG-TERM GOALS OF SOCIETY. UKRAINIAN SOCIETY NEEDS A NATIONAL IDEA, A KEY ELEMENT OF WHICH IS THE IDEA OF THE IDEAL FORM OF SOCIETY, THE STATE AND LAW. THEREFORE THE PROBLEM OF LAW SOCIETY AS A SOCIAL AND CULTURAL IDEAL IS ISSUE OF THE DAY. THE DISCUSSION OF LAW SOCIETY AS A SOCIAL IDEAL IS INSUFFICIENT IN PHILOSOPHICAL AND LAW STUDIES. SOME PREMISES FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE OF LAW SOCIETY CAN BE FOUND IN THE WRITINGS OF V. NERSESYANTS, E. SOLOVIEV, A. GARNIK, S. MAXIMOV, M. TSIMBALYUK, Y. KALINOWSKI, V. ANDRUSHCHENKO. THE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC SOURCES AND PUBLICATIONS INDICATES THAT PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDY OF LAW SOCIETY AS A SOCIAL IDEAL IN ITS RELATION TO THE LEGAL REALITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS REALIZATION IN PRACTICE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORED. SO, DETERMINING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE IDEAL OF LAW SOCIETY AS A SOCIAL IDEAL IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER. SOCIAL IDEALS ARE REQUIRED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE STRUCTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND PRINCIPLES OF REALITY'S DEVELOPMENT AND CONVERSION. THE LAW IDEAL IS A VARIETY OF SOCIAL IDEAL. SOCIAL LAW IDEAL IS AN IDEA WHOSE IMPLEMENTATION IS DESIRABLE AND PROPER. THE IDEA OF IT MUST BE BASED ON CRITICAL ANALYSIS AND REALISM AND INDICATE THE ACTUAL WAYS TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING LEGAL ORDER. THE MAIN THEME OF THIS DOCTRINE SHOULD NOT BE SEARCH OF FINAL SOCIAL PERFECTION, BUT INDICATIONS OF THE ACTUAL WAYS AND MEANS BY WHICH ANY ORDER CAN BE IMPROVED. ONE OF THE PRESENT IDEALS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS TO BUILD THE LAW SOCIETY. IT PROVIDES FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND ITS CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE ARE THE MAIN INSTITUTIONAL AND NON INSTITUTIONAL COMPONENTS. THE INSTITUTIONAL ARE A CIVIL SOCIETY AND A LEGAL STATE. NON-INSTITUTIONAL - THEY ARE PERSON AS AN AUTONOMOUS AND RESPONSIBLE LEGAL ENTITY, VALUES OF ABSOLUTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND JUSTICE. ACCORDING TO S. MAXIMOV, THE FIRST CONDITION FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF LAW ARE NON INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS OF FORMATION LAW COMMUNITY. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF IMPLEMENTING OF LAW SOCIETY WE SHOULD REFER TO THE CONCEPT OF M. ALEKSEEV. HE SAID, THE LEGAL CONCEPT CONSISTS OF THREE LEVELS: THE LEGAL ENTITY, THE LEGAL VALUES AND LEGAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THE IDEAL SOCIETY IS THE IMPROVEMENT THE SUBJECT OF LAW, THE IDEALS EMBODIED IN THE LIFE BY REAL PEOPLE. ACCORDINGLY, THE LEVEL OF THEIR HISTORICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND METHOD OF SOCIAL CREATIVITY MUST BE VERY HIGH. SO PERFECT SUBJECT OF LAW BECOMES SPIRITUALLY MATURE PERSONALITY WITH A WELL-DEVELOPED SENSE OF JUSTICE, SO THAT IT BECOMES POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF A "HEALTHY" INSTITUTIONS OF POSITIVE LAW, ETHICS LEGAL STATUTES AND ACTUAL PERFECT ORDER. THE SECOND STEP TO ACHIEVE THE IDEAL IS A STATEMENT OF LAW VALUES. THE SUBJECT OF LAW KNOWS NATURE OF LAW, CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE VALUE OF EXISTING LAW AND REALIZE VALUE THROUGH THE CREATION OF INSTITUTIONS THAT EMBODY LEGAL VALUES. THUS, WE ACHIEVE A JUST RULE OF LAW, WITH REASONABLE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF ITS MEMBERS. THE IMPLEMENTATION THE LAW IDEAL IS DIALECTICAL, IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE AND AT THE SAME TIME NEVER UNATTAINABLE. RULE OF LAW IS REALIZED GRADUALLY, ANY HISTORICAL PERIOD IS PRESENTED AS A PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED SOCIAL IDEAL. SO LAW SOCIETY DOES NOT PROVIDE EXISTENCE OF ANY EMPIRICAL REALITY. IT IS UNFINISHED MOVEMENT TOWARD THE IDEAL, A GRADUAL PROCESS OF IMPROVING THE SOCIAL ORDER THROUGH CONFIRMATION, PROTECTION AND GUARANTEE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT NOT A ACHIEVING THE FINAL OF PERFECT SOCIAL LIFE. BUT THE IDEA OF POSSIBILITY TO REACH IT IN A PARTICULAR SOCIETY IS COMPULSORY. THE IDEAL OF LAW SOCIETY IS HISTORICALLY VARIABLE PHENOMENON OF LEGAL CULTURE AND THE MODEL OF SOCIAL IDEOLOGY AND IT HIGHLY DEPENDENTS ON THE SOCIO-CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF ATTEMPTS TO IMPLEMENT IT. APPROXIMATION TO THE IDEAL OF LAW SOCIETY ASSUMES AGREEMENT WITH MORAL DEMANDS AND STANDARDS TO THE EXTENT IT IS POSSIBLE IN A SPECIFIC HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL COMMUNITY SPACE. IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BE AWARE OF IT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL LAW IDEAL FOR UKRAINE. IT HAS TO CONSIDER THE GEOPOLITICAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, MENTAL AND HISTORICAL CONDITIONS OF THE NATIONAL CULTURAL AND LEGAL TRADITIONS.
845	ONE OF THE FUNNY THINGS ABOUT LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES IS THAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME: 'SINGAPORE? ISN'T THAT WHERE THEY FLOG YOU FOR CHEWING GUM?' - AND I AM ALWAYS TEMPTED TO SAY YES. THIS QUESTION REVEALS WHAT STICKS IN THE POPULAR US CULTURAL IMAGINARY ABOUT TINY, FARAWAY SINGAPORE. IT IS BASED ON TWO EVENTS: FIRST, IN 1992, THE SALE OF CHEWING GUM WAS BANNED (SALE OF FOOD [PROHIBITION OF CHEWING GUM] REGULATIONS 1992), AND SECOND, IN 1994, 18 YEAR-OLD US CITIZEN, MICHAEL FAY, CONVICTED OF VANDALISM FOR HAVING SPRAY-PAINTED SOME CARS WAS SENTENCED TO SIX STROKES OF THE CANE (MICHAEL PETER FAY V PUBLIC PROSECUTOR). 1 IF SINGAPORE ALREADY HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING A NANNY STATE, THEN THESE TWO EVENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY SHARPENED THAT REPUTATION AND CONFUSED THE STORIES INTO THE COMPOSITE IMAGE THROUGH WHICH AMERICANS SITUATE SINGAPOREANS.
846	UNLIKE ALL OTHER FORMER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES ADMITTED AS EU MEMBERS BEFORE OR AFTER THEM, ROMANIA AND BULGARIA ENTERED A PARTICULAR SUPERVISION REGIME UNDER THE COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP THEM TO CONSOLIDATE THE RULE OF LAW AND TO ACTIVELY IMPEDE CORRUPTION AND ORGANIZED CRIME. YEARS LATER, AFTER THE REFORMS IT INSPIRED ENGENDERED FIERCE POLITICAL BATTLES, THE CVM CAME TO AN END. SHOULD ITS POLICY INSTRUMENTS BE ABANDONED OR NOT AFTER THIS SUDDEN CONCLUSION, IT IS INCREASINGLY OBVIOUS THAT THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE DID NOT DEPEND ON TECHNICAL DECISIONS ONLY, BUT ALSO ON MULTIFACETED POLITICAL INTRICACIES OF DOMESTIC PARTISANSHIP AND POWER STRUGGLES. THROUGH THE MEANS OF THE POLITICAL ANALYSIS, USING A CONTEXT-DRIVEN INTERPRETATIVE APPROACH, THIS ARTICLE UNDERLINES SEVERAL CRUCIAL POLITICALLY CONTESTED ISSUES THAT HAVE RISEN OVER THE YEARS AND SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN ANY JUDICIOUS ASSESSMENT CONCERNING THE REFORM OF THE ROMANIAN JUDICIARY. DRAWING FROM THE OBSERVATION OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AND PUBLIC NARRATIVES, IT DISTINGUISHES THREE PERSISTENT TENSIONS: THE UNEASY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND AUTONOMY, THE PROBLEMATIC OVEREMPHASIS OF THE ROLE OF PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES AS AGENTS OF REFORM WITHIN A LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK AND THE PROMINENCE OF MEDIATIZED CONTENTION AT THE EXPENSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING.
847	THE DEEP-SEATED PROBLEM OF CARBON NEUTRALITY IS THE ENERGY PROBLEM, AND THE CHANGE IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE DETERMINES THE DEGREE OF ACHIEVING CHINA'S DOUBLE CARBON TARGET. THE BASIC PATH TO ACHIEVE THE DUAL CARBON GOAL IS TO REALIZE THE RULE OF LAW IN ENERGY GOVERNANCE, AND THE PREMISE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ENERGY GOVERNANCE IS TO ESTABLISH A PERFECT ENERGY LEGAL SYSTEM. IN THIS PAPER, WE USE LITERARY ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT RESEARCH STATUS OF THIS TOPIC, NORMATIVE AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT LEGAL NORMS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DUAL CARBON GOAL IN CHINA, AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRUCTION STATUS OF THE ENERGY LEGAL SYSTEM OF EACH COUNTRY IN ACHIEVING THE DUAL CARBON GOAL. IN CHINA, THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS SUCH AS THE DILEMMA OF ENERGY LAW STRUCTURE, THE LACK OF DUAL-CARBON LEGISLATIVE GOALS, THE LACK OF BASIC FRAMEWORK LAWS, AND THE DISCONNECTION BETWEEN ENERGY LAWS AND ENERGY POLICIES, ETC. TO REMEDY THESE DILEMMAS AND SHORTCOMINGS, THE PATH OF CONSTRUCTING A PERFECT ENERGY LAW AND REGULATION SYSTEM IS TO: ESTABLISH A CHINESE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PLAN WITH DUALCARBON GOALS; TO FORMULATE A BASIC ENERGY LAW TO LAY THE FRAMEWORK OF CHINA'S ENERGY LEGAL SYSTEM; TO ESTABLISH THE CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES OF ENERGY LEGISLATION AS THE BASIS FOR MAINTAINING A COORDINATED AND UNIFIED ENERGY LEGAL SYSTEM AND SO ON.
848	IN THIS PAPER, I AIM TO EXPLORE ONE OF THE MAIN THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF DR. EUGENIO ZAFFARONI, THE DIALECTIC BETWEEN RIGHT STATE AND POLICE STATE. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE METHOD THE AUTHOR USES FOR FACING THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE CAPITALIST SOCIAL SYSTEM. I ALSO PROPOSE TO IDENTIFY THE FACTS AND THE THEORETICAL TOOLS INVOLVED, AND TO INVESTIGATE THE STRATEGIC TASK POSED, AS WELL AS STRESSING ITS SCIENTIFIC AND POLITICAL UTILITY.
849	HOBBES' THEORY OF THE STATE IS BASED ON NATURAL PRINCIPLES, I.E. EVERYBODY'S SEARCH FOR SECURITY AND PEACE. THE ETERNALLY VALID RULES OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE BETWEEN MEN - THE NATURAL LAWS - ARE EVEN BINDING ON THE SOVEREIGN, HOBBES MAINTAINS. I INTEND TO SHOW THAT, THOUGH THERE IS NO DOUBT IN HOBBES' ASSERTION OF NATURAL LAW, THE DEFINITION OF CIVIL LAW, I.E. THE SOVEREIGN'S WILL, IS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS FACT. HOBBES' BELIEF, THAT THE SOVEREIGN - CARRYING OUT HIS TASK TO GUARANTEE PEACE - WILL IN MOST CASES RESPECT THE LAWS OF NATURE, ALTHOUGH HE CAN IN NO WAY BE OBLIGED TO DO SO IN TERMS OF CIVIL LAW, IS SAID TO BE UNCONVINCING. I ARGUE, THAT IT CAN BE EXPLAINED WITH REGARD TO THE SOVEREIGN'S SITUATION, WHICH, UNLIKE THE NATURALE STATE, IS ONE OF COMPLETE SECURITY. THIS MEANS THAT WAR AS A RESULT OF THE ENDLESS SEARCH FOR MORE POWER IS, IN HOBBES' VIEW, UNNECESSARY FOR AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH.
850	RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEFORESTATION AND POPULATION PRESSURE, INCOME GROWTH, AND INSECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE EXAMINED WITH DATA FROM 120 COUNTRIES. INSECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE HYPOTHESIZED TO ARISE FROM TWO SOURCES: GOVERNMENT INSTABILITY OR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OWNERSHIP AND AN ABSENCE OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY. THE FORMER SOURCE IS CAPTURED BY MEASURES OF GENERAL LAWLESSNESS SUCH AS GUERRILLA WARFARE, REVOLUTION, AND FREQUENT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. THE LATTER IS PROXIED BY VARIABLES INDICATING THE TYPE OF GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE, FREQUENCY OF POLITICAL PURGES, AND THE EXISTENCE OF AN ELECTED LEGISLATURE. GENERAL SUPPORT IS INDICATED FOR THE PROPERTY RIGHTS HYPOTHESIS AND FOR THE EFFECTS OF POPULATION GROWTH.
851	CHINA HAS COME A LONG WAY IN POLITICAL REFORM SINCE THE MAO ERA, YET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REMAINS IN FIRM CONTROL OF POLITICAL POWER AND THE TENSION BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY IS HIGH. ECONOMIC REFORM IN THE PAST 30 YEARS HAS LED TO DRASTIC REDISTRIBUTION OF SOCIAL INTERESTS AND A FURTHER INCREASE IN SOCIAL CONFLICT. THIS STUDY EXAMINES DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN POST-MAO CHINA. USING A 2004 NATIONAL SURVEY, I DEMONSTRATE THE NATURE AND INTENSITY OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONFLICT IN CHINESE SOCIETY BY ANALYSING THE OCCURRENCE OF DISPUTES, THE CHANNELS AND OUTCOME OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT OF THE SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM, I ALSO CONSIDER THE ROLES OF CULTURAL VALUES AND MARKET TRANSITION IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT WHILE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND CULTURAL VALUES DISCOURAGE DISPUTE INITIATION, CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM IS IMPROVING IN FACILITATING DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND IN PROMOTING REGIME LEGITIMACY.
852	BACKGROUND: WHILE ECONOMIC THEORY SUPPORTS THE PERCEPTION THAT CIGARETTE TAXES INCENTIVISE PRODUCERS AND USERS TO IDENTIFY WAYS OF EVADING THE TAX, LEADING TO THE SMUGGLING OF CIGARETTES THROUGH A PROFIT-MAXIMISING MECHANISM, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAS PRODUCED MIXED FINDINGS. AIM: THIS STUDY BRIDGES THE KNOWLEDGE GAP AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE BY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE TAXATION OF CIGARETTES ON CIGARETTE SMUGGLING AND ASSESSING THE CORRELATES OF CIGARETTE SMUGGLING. SETTING: IN THE STUDY MALAWI'S CIGARETTE IMPORTS FROM KENYA AND SOUTH AFRICA FROM 2007 TO 2016 ARE EXAMINED. METHOD: QUINTILE REGRESSION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS. RESULTS: EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASED EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SMUGGLING AS MEASURED BY THE TRADE GAP. USING THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS, THE STUDY FOUND THAT AN INCREASE IN THE BILATERAL EXCHANGE RATE AND CORRUPTION IN THE PARTNER COUNTRIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE SMUGGLING OF CIGARETTES INTO MALAWI. CONCLUSION: RESULTS TALLY WITH SEVERAL EMPIRICAL STUDIES WHILE CONFLICTING WITH OTHERS. ON THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TACKLING CIGARETTE SMUGGLING, USING TAXES ONLY, MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. TO BE EFFECTIVE, COMBATING SMUGGLING MUST ALSO INCLUDE COMBATING CORRUPTION, STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND IMPOSING PUNITIVE EXCISE TAXES ON CIGARETTES. CONTRIBUTION: THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE ON THE IMPACT OF CIGARETTE TAXES ON SMUGGLING OF CIGARETTES USING MALAWI'S TRADE DATA. INTERESTINGLY, INCREASED EXCISE TAXES ON CIGARETTES WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CIGARETTE SMUGGLING. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR POLICYMAKERS ON THE COMPLEXITIES OF CIGARETTE SMUGGLING AND THE NEED TO CONSIDER A RANGE OF FACTORS, SUCH AS STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, TO COMBAT CIGARETTE SMUGGLING.
853	AS IN OTHER POST-CONFLICT STATES, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ACTIVELY PROMOTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TIMOR-LESTE. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM REMAINS THE WEAKEST BRANCH OF TIMOR-LESTE'S GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT LAWS AND PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS TRANSLATED INTO LANGUAGES UNDERSTOOD BY ALL COURT ACTORS. TIMOR-LESTE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF MULTILINGUALISM, WITH AT LEAST SIXTEEN LANGUAGE VARIETIES BEING SPOKEN IN THE COUNTRY. BOTH TETUM AND PORTUGUESE ARE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES, WITH PORTUGUESE BEING PREDOMINANTLY USED IN THE COURTS, EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 10 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IS FLUENT IN THE IDIOM. THE POST-COLONIAL LEGACY WAS ONE OF TWO SEPARATE LEGAL SYSTEMS THE FORMAL LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM OPERATING IN PARALLEL. MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER INDEPENDENCE, THE FORMER CONTINUES TO HAVE ONLY A PERIPHERAL PRESENCE IN THE LIVES OF MOST EAST TIMORESE. THIS GAP BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURTS HEIGHTENS THE CHALLENGES TO NATION- AND STATE-BUILDING IN TIMOR-LESTE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXAMINE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE POLICY IN NMOR-LESTE AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE AVENUES FOR STRENGTHENING THE FORMAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN A MULTILINGUAL ENVIRONMENT.
854	IT IS INCONCEIVABLE TO AVOID THE POLEMIC FIGURE OF CARL SCHMITT IN THE PRESENT THEORETICAL DEBATE ABOUT THE POLITICAL ISSUE AND THE WAY OF ORGANIZING AN STATE. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CARL SCHMITT AND THE SETTING UP PROCESS OF THE REPUBLIC OF WEIMAR, ESPECIALLY IN THAT CONTEXT WHAT REFERS TO HIS WORKING OUT OF HIS THEORY OF CONSTITUTION. WE STRESS THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF SCHMITT'S CRITICISM ON THE WEIMAR'S CONSTITUTION STABLISHING A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW INTRINSICALLY CONTRADICTORY, SO THAT -IN ANY CASE WITHOUT INTENDING IT- HIS CONTRIBUTION ALLOWS THE OVERCOME OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF BONN. THE THEORETICAL ROUTE HERE EXPOSED ALLOWS TO PLACE BEYOND THE JURIDICAL DEBATE THE POLITICAL ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONS AS CORE DOCUMENTS OF EVERY POLITICAL ARCHITECTURE.
855	PRESIDENT SOEHARTO'S RESIGNATION ON MAY 1998 CAME AS A RESULT OF INTENSE DISSATISFACTION WITH HIS MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY AND PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION WITH RENT-SEEKING ACTIVITIES OF HIS FAMILY AND CRONIES. THE RESIGNATION USHERED IN A HEADY PERIOD OF REFORMASI OR REFORM, MARKED BY A EUPHORIC RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN 1999 AND LEGISLATION WHICH SOUGHT TO WRITE REFORM INTO NATIONAL POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE. THE PRESS ACT OF 23 SEPTEMBER 1999, ELECTORAL REFORM, THE ABOLITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION AND THE CREATION OF NEW INDEPENDENT WATCHDOG BODIES WERE PART OF A PROCESS WHICH PLACED THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PUBLIC CENTRE STAGE IN INDONESIA. IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE THE 1999 NATIONAL ELECTIONS, HOWEVER, CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FORCES HAVE RESORTED TO LITIGATION AND LAW AND ORDER RHETORIC TO SLOW DOWN AND EVEN REVERSE THE REFORM AGENDA. IN THIS ARTICLE THE PROCESS OF REFORM RESISTANCE THROUGH LEGAL DEADWEIGHTING IS DOCUMENTED AND EXPLORED IN AN EXAMINATION OF AN EXCESSIVE RESORT TO JUDICIAL REMEDIES BROUGHT AGAINST THE WORK OF THE INDONESIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION IN ITS FIRST PERIOD OF OFFICE.
856	ILLEGAL LOGGING IS A GLOBAL CONCERN, ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS, SUCH AS DEFORESTATION, DEGRADATION OF BIODIVERSITY AND LOSS OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES. DESPITE RECENT INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO COMBAT ILLEGAL LOGGING ACTIVITIES, THE PROBLEM REMAINS WIDESPREAD. WHILE THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT IS EXTENSIVE, LITTLE SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO ANALYSING THE CAUSES OF ILLEGAL LOGGING. HERE, THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP IS ADDRESSED WITH A CROSS-NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF FACTORS HYPOTHESIZED TO IMPACT ILLEGAL LOGGING. THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN THIS STUDY CORROBORATES SOME WIDELY HELD BELIEFS, BUT ALSO PROVIDES SOME NEW INSIGHTS ON THE FACTORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR WHETHER ILLEGAL LOGGING IS LIKELY TO BE A PROBLEM. IT IS SHOWN THAT, BESIDES PHYSICAL-GEOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, A NUMBER OF FACTORS RELATING TO THE LEVEL AND SPEED OF A COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC-INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ILLEGAL LOGGING. THESE INCLUDE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, ECONOMIC GROWTH, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. THE FINDINGS ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING POLICIES TO TACKLE ILLEGAL LOGGING ACTIVITIES.
857	THIS PAPER DOES RESEMBLE A PHILOSOPHICAL-JURIDICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT REFLECTS ON THE POSSIBILITY TO RECONSTRUCT THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY THROUGH A HEGELIAN FOCUS. ITS AIM IS TO TACKLE THE CURRENT CRISIS OF OUR LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE ITS CAUSES. THESE CAUSES ARE NOT ONLY FOUND IN A DEFICIENT PRAXIS OF ITS PURPOSES, BUT FUNDAMENTALLY IN AN INSUFFICIENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT TYPE OF DEMOCRACY. AT THE END, THIS DEMOCRACY, IF WE MIND TO DETER ITS RUIN, HAS TO LAST ON THE IDEA OF UNIVERSAL WILL AND ITS DETERMINATION THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, POLITICAL LIBERTIES OBTAIN A KEY ROLE, ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, WHOSE FINAL PURPOSE LAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RATIONAL POLITICAL WILL.
858	MISSIONARIES WERE AMONG THE FIRST EUROPEANS TO INTERACT WITH THE NEW ZEALAND MAORI, BRINGING AN EVANGELICAL MESSAGE WITH A STRICT SET OF "LAWS" FOR MAORI TO FOLLOW. MAORI, WHOSE OWN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS REQUIRED RIGID OBSERVANCE TO RITUAL, TOOK TIME TO CONVERT TO MISSIONARY CHRISTIANITY BUT, LIKE MANY OCEANIC PEOPLES, DID SO WITH FERVOUR, REGULATING THEIR DAILY LIVES ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE MISSIONARIES' GOD. WITH THE ADVENT OF BRITISH RULE IN NEW ZEALAND IN 1840, THE TREATY OF WAITANGI GAVE MAORI THE SAME RIGHTS AS BRITISH SUBJECTS, BUT ALSO (IN THE MAORI-LANGUAGE VERSION) GUARANTEED TRIBAL AUTONOMY. AS THE BRITISH ADMINISTRATION ESTABLISHED ITSELF, IT SLOWLY ATTEMPTED TO BRING MAORI UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE QUEEN'S LAWS, USING PERSUASION RATHER THAN FORCE. THIS ARTICLE, USING MAORI-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS OF THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY, DISCUSSES HOW SOME MAORI APPROACHED THE QUESTION OF LAW IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW THEY HAD CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY. THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO THEIR OWN, NOW CHRISTIANISED, WORLDVIEW, BUT IT WAS ALSO DUE TO HOW THE COLONIAL AUTHORITIES PRESENTED THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW TO THEM.
859	DURING DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING, THE STATE CAN CURTAIL PRESS FREEDOM THROUGH THE LEGALIZATION OF PRESS CONTROL, THAT IS, THE ESTABLISHMENT AND UTILIZATION OF LEGAL INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTROLLING THE MEDIA AND JOURNALISTIC WORK. DRAWING UPON THE LITERATURE ON AUTHORITARIAN RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT LEGALIZATION OF PRESS CONTROL HAS TO BE EXAMINED BY PAYING ATTENTION TO BOTH THE CONSPICUOUS AND SUBTLE MEASURES THAT CONSTITUTE THE LEGAL MINEFIELD FOR JOURNALISM, THE EVOLUTION OF OFFICIAL DISCOURSES THAT AIM AT LEGITIMIZING THE LAWS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, AND THE CHANGING POLITICS OF SELF-CENSORSHIP AS JOURNALISTS AND THE SOCIETY REACT TO EMERGING LEGAL RISKS. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON HONG KONG AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW IN JUNE 2020. THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN UPDATED ANALYTICAL ACCOUNT OF PRESS FREEDOM IN HONG KONG AND THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF A PROCESS POSSIBLY OBSERVABLE IN OTHER AUTHORITARIAN STATES OR HYBRID REGIMES.
860	IN HIS MEMOIR BLAME ME ON HISTORY (1986[1963]), A REFLECTION ON THE IMPACT OF STATE POWER ON WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED BY GWEN BERGNER "RACED MASCULINE SUBJECT FORMATION", BLOKE MODISANE REFLECTS ON THE NATURE OF LAW AND POLICING DURING APARTHEID. PERFORMING A KIND OF FANONISM AVANT LA LETTRE, MODISANE UNDERCUTS THE LIBERAL IDEOLOGY OF THE RULE OF LAW BY REVEALING LAW AND ITS ENFORCEMENT IN THE COLONIAL CONTEXT AS AN OPPRESSIVE EXERCISE OF STATE POWER. HE REPRESENTS LAW AND POLICING AS INSTANCES OF MATERIAL, DISCURSIVE AND PSYCHIC VIOLENCE INFLICTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERPETUATING THE SUBORDINATION OF THE COLONISED SUBJECT. IN THIS ESSAY, I CONSIDER MODISANE'S ACCOUNT OF LAW AND POLICING, THE PSYCHIC DEBILITATION THEY PRODUCE, AS WELL AS HIS COMMITMENT TO RESISTANCE.
861	SOCIAL GOVERNANCE INNOVATION IS A BASIC REQUIREMENT OF CHINA'S SOCIALIST CONSTRUCTION, AND AN IMPORTANT GUARANTEE THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE AND WORK IN PEACE AND ENJOY LONG-TERM STABILITY AND ORDER. STRENGTHENING AND INNOVATING SOCIAL GOVERNANCE HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND GOVERNANCE CAPACITY, AND THIS IS WHERE JUDICIAL JUSTICE PLAYS A UNIQUE ROLE AT THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, SOCIETY, AND THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS, JUDICIAL JUSTICE IS THE KEY TO TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS; THE GUARANTEE OF A NEW-TYPE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; AND THE GUIDE TO UPGRADING AUTONOMY AT THE GRASS-ROOTS LEVEL. TO ACHIEVE JUDICIAL JUSTICE, WE MUST POPULARIZE THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, IMPROVE JUDICIAL WORK STYLE AND INNOVATE JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS.
862	IN THE PRESENTED PAPER, SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL LIMITATIONS ON STATE POWER WERE COVERED. IN THE SEARCH FOR UNIVERSAL CRITERIA FOR LIMITING POWER, THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAIN THEORIES OF SUCH WAS ANALYZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHRONOLOGY OF THEIR EMERGENCE AND SUBSEQUENT MODERNIZATION: THE LIMITATION ON POWER BY ANOTHER POWER, SELF-LIMITATION OF STATE POWER, THE LIMITATION OF STATE POWER BY LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF LIMITING A STATE POWER IN A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, A CONCLUSION WAS DRAWN ON THE ROLE OF LAW AS THE MAIN CRITERION FOR LIMITING STATE POWER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL STATE PARADIGM.
863	THE TEXT REVIEWS THE INITIATIVES AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE POWER IN ARGENTINA AND NICARAGUA HAVE FORGED IN RECENT COLLECTIONS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEMS. SUCH COMPILATIONS ARE THE ARGENTINE LEGAL DIGEST AND NICARAGUAN LEGAL DIGEST AND HAVE RESPONDED TO PRINCIPLES EARLY CLEARANCE, INVENTORY, HARMONIZATION, NORMATIVE CONSOLIDATION AND UNIFICATION OF LEGISLATION. THE AUTHOR IS INTERESTED IN THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM OF TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL THE EXTENT OF SUCH APPROACHES IN LEGAL AND POLITICAL TERMS OF CONTRIBUTION TO LEGAL SECURITY AND STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW.
864	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO OUTLINE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IN BRAZIL AND DEMONSTRATE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION GRANTED TO SUCH RIGHTS, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCESS TO THEM. THE WORLD BANK'S "DOING BUSINESS" REPORT (2018) WILL BE ANALYZED IN ORDER TO MAP THE WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS OF THE TUTELAGE CONFERRED ON THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY IN THE NATIONAL ORDER IN THE LIGHT OF THE PERCEPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE ANALYSIS WILL BE ESSENTIALLY DESCRIPTIVE OF THE RESULTS PRESENTED BY THE REPORT, WITHOUT A PROPOSITIONAL CHARACTER. IT IS A RELEVANT ISSUE THAT HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY AND ALSO ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POPULATION, SINCE THE LEVEL OF LEGAL CERTAINTY GUARANTEED BY THE INSTITUTIONS IT IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MAIN STANDARDS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW.
865	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE COUNTRY-SPECIFIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ATTRACTING PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT ACROSS SECTORS IN INDIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE ANALYSIS INVOLVES THREE MACROECONOMIC VARIABLES (RULE OF LAW, NET FIIS AND INTEREST RATE) ACROSS SIX SECTORS. ALSO, THREE FIRM-SPECIFIC VARIABLES (ROE, DTA AND EBITDA MARGIN) FOR 89 COMPANIES WITH PRIVATE EQUITY ACROSS FIVE SECTORS. OLS, PRAIS-WINSTEN, MULTINOMIAL LOGIT AND PROBIT REGRESSION MODELS HAVE BEEN USED FOR ANALYSIS. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT WHILE RISING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS DRIVE PE ACTIVITY IN ENERGY AND ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION IS ONE SECTOR, STRONG LEGAL STRUCTURES AND RISING INTEREST RATES ARE THE DRIVERS OF PE ACTIVITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. IN FIRM-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS, THOUGH THE PROFITABILITY AND LEVERAGE EFFECT IS INVISIBLE IN THE INDUSTRIALS AND HEALTHCARE SECTORS, IT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT IN IT AND TELECOM IS ONE SECTOR AND COMMODITIES SECTOR. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE VALUE OF THIS RESEARCH IS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF MOST RELEVANT MACROECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC FACTORS FOR PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS SEEKING INVESTMENT ACROSS SECTORS IN INDIA.
866	AUSTRALIA INVESTS HEAVILY THROUGHOUT THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION IN MECHANISMS TO CONTROL IRREGULAR PEOPLE MOVEMENTS. INFORMATION HAS BEEN LEAKED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE NOTORIOUS DETENTION CENTRES ON NAURU AND MANUS ISLAND, AND ASPECTS OF THE BALI PROCESS ARE WELL KNOWN AND PUBLICISED, BUT THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF MUCH OF AUSTRALIA'S INVESTMENT HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY AIRED OR SCRUTINISED. THIS ARTICLE CANVASSES THE RANGE OF AUSTRALIA'S ENGAGEMENT IN IRREGULAR MIGRATION CONTROLS AND DISCUSSES HOW POLICIES INITIATED BY IT HAVE INFLUENCED POLICIES DEVELOPED BY OTHER COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF AUSTRALIA'S IRREGULAR MIGRATION CONTROL EFFORTS IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER FORMS OF REGIONAL ENGAGEMENT. IT POINTS TO INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN AUSTRALIA'S IRREGULAR MIGRATION REGIME AND OTHER LAW AND JUSTICE PROGRAMS. IT ALSO CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE IRREGULAR MIGRATION REGIME ON REGIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND STABILITY, AND FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
867	THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS THAT A GOAL DEPENDENT, BUT INSTRUMENT INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK SOLVES THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD SOLUTION TO THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT RISKS REINTRODUCING THE BIASES OF POLITICAL CONTROL OVER MONETARY POLICY THROUGH THE POWER OF POLITICIANS TO CHANGE THE MONETARY POLICY RULE. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE PROBLEM AS AN INSTANCE OF THE PARADOX OF POWER IN THE SPHERE OF MONETARY POLICY AND PROPOSES A SOLUTION DRAWING ON CRITERIA FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS. FINALLY A NORMATIVE TEST OF INFLATION TARGETING IS PROPOSED, AGAIN DRAWING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS LITERATURE. JEL CLASSIFICATIONS: E420; E520; E580; E600; H100.
868	THE COLOMBIAN POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF 1991 DEVELOPED A SOCIAL STATE OF LAW FOUNDED ON A CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, WHICH IMPLIES A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES FOR THE EXERCISE OF POWER. FROM A FORMALIST PERSPECTIVE, IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRI - BUTION SO THAT STATE DECISIONS RESPOND TO A BALANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DEMANDS THAT ULTIMATELY BENEFIT THE GENERAL INTEREST OVER THE INDIVIDUAL. HOWEVER, FROM AN ANTI -FORMALIST PERSPECTIVE, POLITICAL PHENOMENA ARE EVIDENT THAT PUT AN APPARENTLY PLAUSIBLE DESIGN AT RISK; POLITICAL PRACTICES TEND TO BENEFIT THE PARTICULAR INTEREST OVER THE GENERAL. IT IS A RECURRING PHENOMENON IN THE COLOMBIAN REALITY, WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A RISK FOR THE FULL MATERIALIZATION OF THE WEIGHTED POSTULATES OF CHECKS AND BALANCES FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW.
869	THE SARS-COV-2 PANDEMIC OUTBREAK IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC IN MARCH 2020 REQUIRED RAPID LEGAL RESPONSE TO PROTECT LIVES AND HEALTH OF INHABITANTS AND NEW COMPLEX CHALLENGES EMERGED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS AN ANALYSIS AND CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF MEASURES ADOPTED IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH LAW. AS MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FIELDS IN SLOVAKIA AROSE: 1/LEGALITY AND HIERARCHY OF MEASURES LIMITING EVERYDAY LIFE AND EXERCISE OF CITIZEN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS; 2/THE SCOPE, PROPORTIONALITY, EXTENT AND DURATION OF MEASURES; 3/ADHERENCE TO THE MEASURES BY THE PUBLIC AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES. THE PANDEMIC UNRAVELED NEED TO INNOVATE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES CONTROL, FOR EXAMPLE, CONSTITUTIONAL EMERGENCY REGIMEN, OR POWERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY. ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK SERVED TO SAFEGUARDING AGAINST SOME DISPROPORTIONATE OR UNWANTED EFFECTS OF ANTIPANDEMIC MEASURES, HOWEVER, FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SOPHISTICATED LEGAL TOOLS TO CONTROL THE PANDEMIC IS NEEDED.
870	THE FIDESZ-KDNP COALITION PARTIES WERE VOTED INTO OFFICE IN 2010 WITH A TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE UNICAMERAL NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, WHICH GAVE THEM SIGNIFICANT LEEWAY TO IMPLEMENT THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA SMOOTHLY. NEVERTHELESS, THE GOVERNING COALITION, DRIVEN BY REVOLUTIONARY ZEAL, WAS DETERMINED TO PUT IN PLACE MAJOR LEGISLATIVE REFORMS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE FACE OF EVERY OPPOSITION. THIS ATTITUDE LED TO THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF PARLIAMENTARY LEGISLATION WHICH MANIFESTED ITSELF IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF SERIOUS IRREGULARITIES OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PROCEDURAL FLAWS OF PARLIAMENTARY LAW-MAKING CONSTITUTE AN INFRINGEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE AS IT IS INTERPRETED IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THE SITUATION IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS IN HUNGARY THAN THE CRITICISMS VOICED BY THE EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW MECHANISMS SUGGEST, WE ANALYZE ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW CASES IN WHICH LEGISLATIVE ACTS WERE CHALLENGED ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS AFTER 2010. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS THE OUTCOME OF THE CASES ADJUDICATED BY THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT TO SEE WHICH IRREGULARITIES WERE FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
871	HAYEK PUBLISHED A PIECE IN 1960 THAT CRITICIZED CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AS A NORM FOR ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS, ALTHOUGH HE REGARDED CORPORATE ACTIONS TO BE SUBJECT TO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MORAL RULES AS INDIVIDUAL ACTION. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND REORGANIZES HAYEK'S CRITICISMS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, THE RULE OF LAW AND MORALITY, HIS COMPARISON OF THE OPEN SOCIETY AND THE CLOSED SOCIETY, AND HIS TREATMENT OF CHARITY AND ALTRUISM. THE AIM IS TO CLARIFY THE HAYEKIAN PERSPECTIVE ON CSR. THESE CONSIDERATIONS EXPLAIN WHY THE 'SOCIAL' PERSPECTIVE ON RESPONSIBILITY IS CONSIDERED DANGEROUS IN A FREE SOCIETY, HOW TO SEPARATE LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND MORALITY FROM CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE.
872	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE MULTI-DIMENSIONALITY OF WELFARE FOR A REDEFINITION OF THE NORMATIVE CONTENT OF THE NOTION OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXISTENTIAL MINIMUM, TRACING, FROM THIS REDEFINITION, A NEW UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE BRAZILIAN COOPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL FEDERALISM. IT WAS ADOPTED DIALECTICAL METHOD OF APPROACH, FROM DOCTRINAL CONTRIBUTIONS. THUS, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO VERIFY THAT THE CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW FACES TWO CENTRAL CHALLENGES: OVERCOMING ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICES. TO FACE THEM, COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL, THAT ADOPT THE FEDERATIVE MODEL, SHOULD PRIORITIZE SYSTEMIC AND COOPERATIVES SOLUTIONS IN THE FEDERATION. THE FEDERAL COOPERATION THAT GUIDES SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC POLICIES IN BRAZIL SHALL BE BY REFERENCE THE PARADIGMATIC NOTIONS OF SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL EXISTENTIAL MINIMUM AND WELL-BEING. THE DUTIES OF STATE PROTECTION IN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE CURRENT BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK INCORPORATE THUS THE REFERENTIAL NO LESS PARADIGMATIC OF SUSTAINABILITY AS ITS PRIMARY AIM.
873	THE TEXT ANALYZES AND SYSTEMATIZES THE FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINE OF DUTY TO JUSTIFY THE JUDICIAL SENTENCES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. THIS DUTY RESTS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS PRINCIPLES, VALUES AND RIGHTS INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION, ON THE << POLITICAL >> SYSTEM (DEMOCRACY) AND ON THE << LEGAL >> SYSTEM OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. THE PECULIARITIES OF JUDICIAL JUSTIFICATION ARE EXAMINED IN EACH OF THESE DIMENSIONS (RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTION, POLITICAL SYSTEM AND LEGAL SYSTEM). IN RELATION TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM, I FOCUS ON THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF JUDICIAL JUSTIFICATION ABOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL DECISION (FACTUAL PART AND NORMATIVE PART) IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL PRACTICE. FINALLY, I EXAMINE THE MAIN PATHOLOGIES OF JUDICIAL JUSTIFICATION IN THE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITY OF JUDGES AND COURTS OF JUSTICE.
874	THE STUDY IS DIRECTED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY AS AN OBJECT OF RESEARCH, AND TO THEIR INTERACTION, THROUGH EDUCATION (COMMUNITY SCHOOL) INDIRECTLY, AS ITS SUBJECT OF RESEARCH. THE OBJECTIVE IS, IN THE FIRST PLACE, TO OUTLINE THE VALUE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR EFFICIENT DIALOGUE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE, TO LOOK FOR PERSPECTIVES OF THEIR INTERACTION IN AND THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVES OF PERSONALITY. THESE OBJECTIVES TOGETHER EXPRESS THE IDEA THAT THE STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY CANNOT EFFECTIVELY INTERACT WITHOUT THE MEDIATORY AND REGULATORY VALUATION FUNCTION OF EDUCATION AND THEIR PARTICIPANTS, BECAUSE VALUES ARE CULTIVATED IN THE HUMAN SOUL OF BOTH CITIZENS AND STATESMEN THROUGH EDUCATION.
875	PURPOSE - AS THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR WINDS DOWN, THE MASSIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE DEVASTATED CITIES HAS BECOME A RECURRING SUBJECT OF POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS. A CRUCIAL QUESTION PERVADES ALL THESE DEBATES: IS THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK ADEQUATE FOR CONFRONTING THE RECONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY? WITH THE PURPOSE OF UNDERSTANDING AND INFORMING THE QUESTION, THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGAL INSTRUMENT FOR THE SYRIAN URBAN RECONSTRUCTION, LAW 10/2018. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL TEXT AND OF ITS EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS PROVIDED. FOLLOWING A DOCTRINAL LEGAL APPROACH, INTERNAL INCONSISTENCIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE "LEGAL GAPS" THAT MIGHT ALLOW AND FAVOR INSTANCES OF DISRESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY CAPTURE. FINDINGS - THE MAIN HYPOTHESES DISCUSSED ARE, FIRST, FROM A DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE, THAT THE NEOLIBERAL TREND IN THE SYRIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY UNDERPINS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE SYRIAN RECONSTRUCTION. SECOND, FROM A DESIGN PERSPECTIVE, THAT, WHILE OFFERING A STRONG MECHANISM FOR DISCIPLINING THE SYRIAN URBAN PLANNING, LAW 10/2018 DOES NOT WARRANT A SCENARIO OF RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SEEMS TOO EASY PREY FOR REGULATORY CAPTURE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - WHILE THE MOST RECENT AND PROMINENT LEGAL INSTRUMENT AIMED TO FRAME SYRIAN POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION, LAW 10/2018, HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO MULTIPLE POLICY ANALYZES AND CRITIQUES, THESE HAVE FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON ITS PRESUMED WARCHITECTURE DIMENSION, LACKING CONTEXTUAL DEPTH AND, MOST WORRYINGLY, IGNORING ANY KIND OF DOCTRINAL LEGAL ANALYSIS. SETTING THE LAW 10/2018 IN ITS LEGAL CONTEXT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE YET, EVEN IF, ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN ONTOLOGY, LEGAL PROVISIONS HAVE TO BE UNDERSTOOD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM THEY ARE INSERTED IN. THIS PAPER DELVES INTO THE SUBJECT, ANALYZING THE LEGAL TEXT, ITS JURIDICAL CONTEXT AND THE WAY IT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKER WHILE LOOKING AT INSTANCES WHERE THE AXIOLOGICAL GOALS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROCLAIMED AND LEGALLY ENSHRINED MIGHT BE PREVENTED BY THE VERY REGULATORY CONFIGURATION.
876	THE LITERATURE EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS ON THE SPREAD OF CONFLICT REMAINS SCARCE DESPITE 100 CIVILIANS BEING KILLED IN ARMED CONFLICTS EVERY DAY AS PER UNITED NATIONS STATISTICS. WE EMPLOY THE TWO-PART MODEL TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS ON THE SPREAD OF CONFLICT IN 190 COUNTRIES FROM 2000 TO 2016. WE FIND THAT A BETTER RULE OF LAW LOWERS THE SPREAD OF CONFLICT BY INCREASING THE COST OF VIOLENCE FOR PERPETRATORS. NEXT, CONDITIONAL ON THE CONFLICT BEING PRESENT, COUNTRIES WITH WEAKER CORRUPTION CONTROL EXPERIENCE A LOWER SPREAD OF CONFLICT. CONSISTENT WITH THE "GREASE THE WHEELS" HYPOTHESIS, THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT VICTIMIZED GROUPS USE BRIBERY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST VIOLENCE. FINALLY, PRESS FREEDOM REDUCES THE SPREAD OF CONFLICT BY PROMOTING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, WITH THE EFFECT BEING HIGHER IN COUNTRIES WITH GREATER INTERNET PENETRATION. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE ROLES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN PREVENTING THE LOSS OF LIVES DUE TO CONFLICTS.
877	ADDING A SOMEWHAT NEW DIMENSION TO THE SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF RESEARCH ON FACTORS DRIVING CROSS-NATIONAL CORRUPTION, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIMENSIONS OF ENFORCEMENT IN REDUCING CORRUPTION. THE MAIN NOVELTY LIES IN COMPARING THE RELATIVE INFLUENCES OF LATENT ENFORCEMENT (POLICE, JUDICIAL, AND PROSECUTORIAL EMPLOYMENT) VERSUS ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT (CONVICTION RATES) AND ENFORCING INSTITUTIONS. RESULTS SHOW THAT PIECEMEAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYMENT WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE, RATHER COMPREHENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY BY STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW OR REGULATORY QUALITY BEAR GREATER RESULTS. THESE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST ACROSS INDICES OF CORRUPTION THAT CAPTURE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT ASPECTS. THUS, IN TERMS OF THE TITLE OF THE PAPER, WHEN IT COMES TO CORRUPTION CONTROL, STRONG GUMS (INSTITUTIONS) ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SHOWING TEETH (ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYMENT) OR THE BITE (CONVICTION RATES).
878	AS A WTO MEMBER AND ONE OF THE LARGEST TRADING COUNTRIES, CHINA IS SUBJECT TO A SERIES OF RULE-OF-LAW RELATED INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS. YET, CHINA EMPHASIZES 'CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS', 'RULE BY LAW', AND RECENTLY, 'SOCIALIST ETHICS'. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF WTO LAW ON CHINA? THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE WTO AND CHINESE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW SETTINGS. THROUGH REVIEWING THE ROLES OF SELF, LAW, AND GOVERNMENT UNDER CONFUCIANISM AND CHINESE LEGALISM, THIS STUDY FINDS THAT CHINA GENERALLY ADOPTS A CONFUCIAN INTERNAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BASED ON SELF-REGULATION, WHICH NEGATES EXTERNAL CONTROL. THE WTO LAW, HOWEVER, ASSUMES A CHINESE LEGALIST LIKE EXTERNAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BASED ON CONTROL BY RULES IN THE FORM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. THE IMPACT OF WTO LAW ON CHINA, THEREFORE, IS ABOUT A BATTLE BETWEEN THESE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FRAMEWORKS AT THE OPPOSITE REGULATORY DIRECTIONS. ON THIS BATTLEFIELD, CHINA SEEMS NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THE WTO YET.
879	THE DIGITAL DISRUPTION OF THE MEDIA AND SOCIETY HAS CHANGED HOW CITIZENS PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC DEBATE AND DEMOCRACY. TODAY, INTERNET PLATFORMS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE. HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE IN THE SPREAD OF DISORDERS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE HAS INCREASED FEARS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY. THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT THE REGULATION OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN EUROPE IS FRAGMENTED. THEREFORE, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND INDIVIDUAL STATES ARE ASKING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO MONITOR THEIR CONTENT. A LACK OF COMPETENCE IN REGULATING PLATFORMS HAS LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF VARIOUS FORMS OF REGULATION, SUCH AS LOOSE CO-REGULATION AND THE PRIVATE CENSORSHIP OF CONTENT. THESE NEW REGULATIONS CHALLENGE THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOCTRINE AND PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
880	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOT ONLY A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE IMPARTIALITY OF JUDGES, IT CAN ALSO ENDANGER IT: JUDGES THAT ARE INDEPENDENT COULD HAVE INCENTIVES TO REMAIN UNINFORMED, BECOME LAZY OR EVEN CORRUPT. IT IS THEREFORE OFTEN ARGUED THAT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ARE COMPETING ENDS. IN THIS PAPER, IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THEY CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY MEANS TOWARDS ACHIEVING IMPARTIALITY AND, IN TURN, THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS FURTHER ARGUED THAT JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY CAN INCREASE PER CAPITA INCOME THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS ONE OF WHICH IS THE REDUCTION OF CORRUPTION. FIRST TESTS CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF JA ARE CARRIED OUT AND ON THE BASIS OF 75 COUNTRIES, THESE PROXIES ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FOR EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN PER CAPITA INCOME DRAWING BOTH ON OLS AS WELL AS TSLS.
881	CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA'S FUTURE, A PANEL OF CHINESE LEGAL SCHOLARS INVITED PROFESSOR DUNCAN KENNEDY TO DISCUSS LEGAL TRANSPLANTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS COMMENTARY CONTEXTUALIZES THEIR IDEAS AND CONCERNS AND AIMS TO CLARIFY SOME CONCEPTS AND ARGUMENTS THAT UNDERLAY THEIR DISCUSSION. AT TIMES THOUGH USING THE SAME WORDS THE PARTICIPANTS WERE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS. BY LEGAL TRANSPLANTS, THE CHINESE SCHOLARS WERE INITIALLY SPEAKING OF SPECIFIC LAWS, WHILE DUNCAN KENNEDY WAS REFERRING TO LEGAL THOUGHT. BY LAW BEING POLITICAL, DUNCAN KENNEDY LARGELY MEANT THE DISTRIBUTIVE AND DISCRETIONARY NATURE OF ADJUDICATION, WHILE THE CHINESE PARTICIPANTS WERE CRITICIZING THE INTERFERENCE BY THE PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT WITH JUDICIAL PRACTICE. YET THROUGH THIS ENCOUNTER, MUCH WAS EXCHANGED AND DEBATED. REGARDING THE TRIGGERS OF LEGAL TRANSPLANTS, THE CHINESE PARTICIPANTS EMPHASIZED THE LAW'S QUALITY AND THE DONOR'S POWER, WHILE DUNCAN KENNEDY WAS MORE INTERESTED IN CHANCE AND THE RECIPIENT'S STRATEGY. AMONG THE MULTIPLE WAYS OF DEFINING THE RULE OF LAW, BOTH SIDES AGREED THAT IT SHOULD BE AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY CHECKS THE EXECUTIVE POWER. NONETHELESS, EACH SIDE HAD THEIR OWN HOPES AND RESERVATIONS ON HOW THIS INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK CAN ENABLE JUDGES TO FAITHFULLY APPLY THE LAW.
882	THIS PAPER CRITICALLY ANALYZES THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IN SHAPING KOSOVO'S POLITICAL FUTURE, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE SUCCESSES, CHALLENGES, AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE EU'S INVOLVEMENT FOR KOSOVO-SERBIA RELATIONS. DRAWING ON EXISTING LITERATURE AND PRIMARY SOURCES, THE PAPER COMPARES THE EU'S APPROACH TO KOSOVO WITH ITS POLICIES TOWARDS OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, INCLUDING BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AND NORTH MACEDONIA. THROUGH THIS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT KOSOVO FACES IN ITS EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE WITH THE EU, INCLUDING THE LACK OF RECOGNITION FROM FIVE EU MEMBER STATES AND ONGOING POLITICAL DISPUTES WITH SERBIA. ADDITIONALLY, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF EU CONDITIONALITY ON KOSOVO'S DOMESTIC POLITICS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO CORRUPTION AND THE RULE OF LAW. OVERALL, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT WHILE THE EU HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SHAPING KOSOVO'S POLITICAL FUTURE, ONGOING CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY IMPACT KOSOVO'S PATH TOWARDS EU ACCESSION.
883	THE PREVAILING VIEW IN INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE IS THAT, BY CONSENTING TO ARBITRATION, A STATE DOES NOT WAIVE ITS IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION. YET, IN THE CONTEXT OF ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) - AS IN THE CONTEXT OF ARBITRATION BETWEEN STATES AND PRIVATE PARTIES MORE GENERALLY - THE PROBLEM OF EXECUTION IMMUNITIES IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE TO THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARBITRAL AWARDS. WHEN IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION ALLOWS STATES TO ESCAPE OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE FREELY UNDERTAKEN, AND WHEN IT WITHHOLDS FROM CLAIMANTS THE FRUITS OF A FAVOURABLE AWARD, THE BENEFITS OF ARBITRATION BECOME ILLUSORY. THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE PREVAILING VIEW IS NO LONGER COMPELLING. WE ARGUE THAT DOMESTIC COURTS CAN AND SHOULD UPHOLD THE RULE-OF-LAW OBJECTIVES AND BENEFITS OF THE ICSID CONVENTION BY ADJUSTING THEIR APPROACH TO IMMUNITY CLAIMS IN THE ARBITRAL CONTEXT: CONSENT TO ARBITRATION SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AS AN IMPLIED WAIVER OF IMMUNITY FROM EXECUTION.
884	IN THIS ARTICLE, I CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL FOUNDATION OF THE BIOETHICS OF PHILOSOPHER JEAN-FRAN DOUBLE DAGGER OIS MALHERBE, PARTICULARLY AS PRESENTED IN HIS BOOK, POUR UNE A PARTS PER THOUSAND THIQUE DE LA M,DECINE. MALHERBE ARGUES THAT SUCH PRACTICES AS ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANTS, ASSISTED REPRODUCTION, RESUSCITATION, AND OTHER USES OF BIOTECHNOLOGIES IN CONTEMPORARY MEDICINE ARE UNETHICAL BECAUSE THEY GO AGAINST ESSENTIAL HUMAN NATURE. FURTHERMORE, HE USES THIS POSITION AS A BASIS TO PRESCRIBE PUBLIC POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE. IN CONTRAST, I ARGUE NOT ONLY THAT 'HUMAN NATURE' IS MUCH MORE MALLEABLE AND ADAPTIVE TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY THAN MALHERBE ALLOWS, BUT ALSO THAT HIS CRITICISMS OF MEDICINE AND TECHNOSCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT OVERSTEP THE BOUNDS OF THE SOCIAL FUNCTION OF PHILOSOPHICAL ETHICS, WHICH IS TO INFORM AND CLARIFY PUBLIC DEBATE. PUBLIC POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE IS THUS BEST LEFT TO THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PROCESS UNDER THE PARAMETERS OF THE JUST RULE OF LAW.
885	PURPOSE - LEE KUAN YEW, SINGAPORE'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER, WHO GOVERNED THE COUNTRY FROM 1959 TO 1990, PASSED AWAY ON 23 MARCH 2015 AT THE AGE OF 91. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS HIS LEGACY OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SINGAPORE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE CHANGES IN SINGAPORE'S POLICY CONTEXT DURING 1959-2014 ARE DESCRIBED FIRST BEFORE ANALYZING LEE'S LEGACY OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SINGAPORE BY EXAMINING HIS BOOKS AND MAJOR SPEECHES. FINDINGS - LEE KUAN YEW'S COMMITMENT TO MERITOCRACY, EMPOWERMENT OF THE CORRUPT PRACTICES INVESTIGATION BUREAU TO CURB CORRUPTION EFFECTIVELY, RELIANCE ON COMPETITIVE SALARIES TO ATTRACT THE "BEST AND BRIGHTEST" CITIZENS TO JOIN THE CIVIL SERVICE, AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTE HIS LEGACY OF GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SINGAPORE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER WILL BE USEFUL TO POLICY-MAKERS, SCHOLARS AND READERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT LEE KUAN YEW'S CONTRIBUTION TO GOOD GOVERNANCE IN SINGAPORE.
886	BASED ON THE DATA FROM THE 13-MONTH FIELD VISIT SPREAD OVER TWO TRIPS (SEPTEMBER 2016 TO DECEMBER 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 2017 TO JULY 2018), THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS HOW SECURITISATION EFFORTS FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT INTERACT WITH ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION (ENGO) ACTIVISM AND ADVOCACY IN CHINA, PRODUCING DIVERSE OUTCOMES ACROSS TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DIMENSIONS. THE TRAJECTORY OF STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE DEPENDS ON (A) THE ABILITY OF PARTY-STATE TO CONTROL 'NEW MEDIA' ACTIVISM AND MANAGE ENGO ADVOCACY TO 'MAINTAIN STABILITY/RULE BY LAW' AND (B) ABILITY OF THE ASSEMBLAGE OF MEDIA ACTIVISM AND ENGO ADVOCACY, ALONG WITH OTHER AGENTS, TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION FROM 'RULE BY LAW' TO 'RULE OF LAW'. THE OVERALL FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 'COPENHAGEN SCHOOL' FRAMEWORK IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORY TO EXAMINE THE PROCESS OF SECURITISATION IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SECTOR IN CHINA. THE SECURITISING ACTOR (THE ONE WHO LEADS THE PROCESS OF SECURITISATION SUCH AS STATES), REFERENT OBJECT (THE OBJECT UNDER EXISTENTIAL THREAT, I.E. HUMAN NATURE HARMONY) AND FUNCTIONAL ACTORS (THOSE WHO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE PROCESS OF SECURITISATION, I.E. ENGOS) ARE THE MAJOR PLAYERS INVOLVED.
887	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE THEORETICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF DETERMINING THE CONTENT, ESSENCE, AND GUARANTEES OF LEGALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE LEGALITY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE IS A TRADITIONAL IDEA IN THE GENERAL THEORY OF LAW THAT THE ORDER AND CONSISTENCY OF RELATIONS REGULATED BY LAW ARE REFLECTED IN THE "LEGALITY" CATEGORY. THE LEADING METHOD OF STUDYING THE PROBLEM WAS THE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, WHICH ALLOWED STUDYING VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF LEGALITY IN THE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICIPANTS IN PUBLIC RELATIONS ON SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. IT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED THAT THE LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE THE RESULTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW, ARE OBJECTIVE, AND EXIST IN ANY HISTORICAL PERIOD IN ANY STATE. THEY DIFFER IN LEVEL AND CONTENT, BUT THEY EXIST OBJECTIVELY SINCE THERE IS A RIGHT. IT IS WITH THE EMERGENCE OF LAW AS A SPECIFIC REGULATOR OF PUBLIC RELATIONS THAT LEGALITY AND PUBLIC ORDER ARISE AS THE RESULTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGAL NORMS. HOWEVER, THESE ARE DIFFERENT RESULTS IN TERMS OF CONTENT AND INTERNAL QUALITY. LEGALITY IS EXPRESSED IN LAWFUL BEHAVIOR, IN THE LEGAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW. THE IDEA OF LEGALITY IS INSEPARABLE FROM LAW AND THE STATE.
888	CORRUPTION PROVOKES MUCH ANGER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICAN (MENA) AND WAS IMPORTANT IN THE ARAB UPRISINGS; IT WAS GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION THAT SPARKED THE GREATEST ANGER AMONG THE POPULATION. THE ARGUMENT OF THIS REPORT IS (A) THAT CORRUPTION IS A MAJOR AND OBVIOUS BREACH OF TRUST, (B) THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR CIVIL' CORRUPTION - WASTA' IN EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESS CORRUPTION - (C) THAT AS WELL AS NOT TRUSTING THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ITS INSTITUTIONS, MENA RESIDENTS DO NOT TRUST EACH OTHER EITHER, TO THE DETRIMENT OF MAINTAINING FUNCTIONAL NATION STATES WITHOUT COERCION, AND (D) THAT CORRUPTION IS A SPECIAL CASE OF BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR A DECENT SOCIETY. THE INITIAL FOCUS ON CORRUPTION LEADS TO CONSIDERATION OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN REASONABLY EXPECT FROM GOVERNMENT AND FROM EACH OTHER. ULTIMATELY, CORRUPTION DIVIDES THE SOCIETY INTO THOSE WHO EXTORT BRIBES OR DISPENSE FAVOURS AND THOSE WHO ARE REQUIRED TO PAY BRIBES AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM FAVOUR - IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS A BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL INCLUSION. FURTHER, IT DESTROYS TRUST BETWEEN PEOPLE AND TRUST IN SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH BREAKS THE CORDS THAT HOLD MODERN SOCIETIES TOGETHER - IT IS AN ATTACK ON SOCIAL COHESION. THE ARTICLE IS BASED MAINLY ON THE ARAB TRANSFORMATIONS SURVEY, CARRIED OUT IN SIX DEVELOPING MENA COUNTRIES IN 2014, THREE YEARS AFTER THE ARAB SPRING'.
889	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SUITABLE LEGAL AND POLITICAL FRAMEWORK FOR CITIZENS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO GOOD GOVERNMENT. AFTER DESCRIBING THE SOCIAL CONDITION OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT LEADS THEM TO COME TOGETHER AND BIND THEMSELVES TO A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION THROUGH A SOCIAL CONTRACT, THE DIFFERENT HISTORICAL FORMS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE ANALYZED UP TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONALISM COMBINES THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY. THIS MEANS THAT THE VALIDITY OF A REGULATION FROM A STRICTLY FORMAL PERSPECTIVE IS NOT SUFFICIENT; ITS CONTENT MUST ALSO RESPECT THE VALUES, PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1978 EMPHASIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY (SECTION 10.1) AND THE INSTRUMENTAL ROLE OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AS A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WHICH SHALL SERVE THE GENERAL INTERESTS IN A SPIRIT OF OBJECTIVITY (SECTION 103.1). THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ACHIEVING NOT ONLY THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GOVERNMENT, BUT ALSO THE QUALITY OF ITS SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ETHICAL COMMITMENTS TO ITS CITIZENS, WHICH ENTAILS CARRYING OUT POLICIES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THESE COMMITMENTS AND AVOIDING POLICIES WHICH ARE NOT. THIS LEGAL, POLITICAL AND ETHICAL EXPOSITION MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND GOOD GOVERNMENT IN ALL ITS COMPLEXITY.
890	THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS FACING THE DILEMMA OF AN INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF PUBLIC GOODS DUE TO THE CONJUNCTION OF VARIOUS FORCES AND FACTORS INCLUDING THE PROFOUND IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, INCREASED TRADE PROTECTIONISM, CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) IS A NON-RIVALROUS AND NON-EXCLUDABLE PUBLIC GOOD PROVIDED TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY BY CHINA AS A RESPONSIBLE MAJOR COUNTRY IN THE NEW ERA OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROMOTING AND GUARANTEEING THE SUPPLY OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS (IPGS). SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE, THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY, WITH THE RULE OF LAW BEING THE BASIC PREMISE AND IMPORTANT GUARANTEE OF THE LONG-TERM AND SMOOTH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BRI. IN PURSUING THE BRI, BUTTRESSED AS IT IS BY THE RULE OF LAW, CHINA SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO DIVERSIFIED GOVERNANCE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF INTERNATIONAL SOFT AND HARD LAW AND MAKE JUDICIOUS USE OF EXISTING BILATERAL, REGIONAL AND MULTILATERAL INTERNATIONAL LEGAL MECHANISMS. IN ADDITION, CHINA MUST ALSO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND TRADE RULES AND MUST INNOVATE AND IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO SUPPLY RULES FOR INVESTMENT, TRADE LIBERALIZATION, ETC. BUTTRESSED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE BRI SHOULD FOCUS NOT ONLY ON RECENT CONCRETE INITIATIVES IN TRADE AND INVESTMENT LIBERALIZATION, BUT ALSO ON THE LONG-TERM PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPLY, SO AS TO REALIZE THE VISION AND GOALS OF THE BRI.
891	THE CENTRALIZATION OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, TWO CRUCIAL ELEMENTS OF STATE FORMATION, ARE OFTEN IGNORED BY THE STATE-BUILDING LITERATURE. THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE MONOPOLIZATION OF JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION, USING THE HISTORICAL EXAMPLE OF THE GENERAL INDIAN COURT (GIC) OF COLONIAL MEXICO. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THIS COURT'S DEVELOPMENT AND DECISION-MAKING PROCESS CAN SHOW US HOW THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPS IN HIGHLY AUTHORITARIAN CONTEXTS. CENTRALIZED COURTS COULD BE USED STRATEGICALLY TO SOLVE AN AGENCY PROBLEM, LIMITING LOCAL ELITES' POWER AND MONITORING STATE AGENTS. TO CURB THESE ACTORS' POWER, THE SPANISH CROWN ALLOWED THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION TO RAISE CLAIMS AND ACCESS PROPERTY RIGHTS. BUT THIS ACCESS REMAINED LIMITED AND SUBJECT TO THE CROWN'S STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS. THE AUTHOR'S THEORY PREDICTS THAT A FAVORABLE RULING FOR THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION WAS MORE LIKELY IN CASES THAT THREATENED TO INCREASE LOCAL ELITES' POWER. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE RULE OF LAW CAN EMERGE IN A CONTEXT WHERE A POWERFUL RULER IS INTERESTED IN IMPOSING LIMITS ON LOCAL POWERS-AND ON THEIR POTENTIAL PREDATION OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE ENDOGENOUS FACTORS BEHIND THE CREATION OF COLONIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL SYSTEMS IN COLONIAL GOVERNANCE.
892	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) AND DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN POST-CONFLICT CONTEXTS, DRAWING ON KOSOVO AS A CASE. THE STUDY FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR ON THE JUSTICE SECTOR IN KOSOVO, REVIEWING THE WAYS IN WHICH SECURITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY HAVE BEEN INTERTWINED. THE ARTICLE FIRST OUTLINES THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERNATIONAL MISSION IN KOSOVO, BEFORE PROCEEDING TO CONSIDER HOW THE OBJECTIVES, NEEDS AND CONSTRAINTS OF DIFFERENT ACTORS HAVE INFLUENCED THE REFORM OF THE SECURITY INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS. THEREAFTER, IT DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTS OF SSR AND DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, BRIEFLY REVIEWING THE UN DISCOURSE AND RECORD IN SSR-RELATED ACTIVITIES. FINALLY, IT EXPLORES THE INTERPLAY OF THESE FACTORS IN THE KOSOVO JUSTICE SECTOR REFORM PROCESS. THE MAIN FINDING STEMMING FROM THIS ANALYSIS IS THAT NOT ONLY DO SSR AND DEMOCRATIZATION AGENDAS INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER, BUT MEASURES ADOPTED TO COPE WITH SECURITY CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE POST-CONFLICT CONTEXT CAN ALSO AFFECT THEM BOTH. FURTHERMORE, THIS FINDING DEMONSTRATES THAT A WELL-DEVELOPED UN THEORETICAL DISCOURSE IS STILL NOT MATCHED BY THE REALITY OF UN PRACTICES IN THE FIELD.
893	AN EXAMINATION OF RECENT JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN THIS JURISDICTION SHOWS THAT THERE IS AN INEXORABLE TREND TOWARDS REQUIRING DECISION-MAKERS ENTRUSTED WITH STATUTORY DISCRETIONARY POWERS TO PROVIDE REASONS FOR THEIR DECISIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DIFFERENT UNDERLYING RATIONALES FOR THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE REASONS FOR DECISIONS EXERCISED PURSUANT TO STATUTORY DISCRETIONARY POWERS. WHILE FAIRNESS IS VIEWED AS A SIGNIFICANT TOUCHSTONE IN THIS REGARD, THE CONCEPT IS FORMULATED MORE IN TERMS OF FAIRNESS TOWARDS THE INDIVIDUAL AFFECTED BY A DECISION RATHER THAN BEING BASED ON BROADER RULE OF LAW CONSIDERATIONS. THE GREATER FOCUS ON VINDICATING THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THIS CONTEXT IS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE RIGHTS-BASED FOCUS TO THE CONCEPT OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS IN THIS JURISDICTION.
894	PURPOSE - PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF THE EVIAN GROUP @ IMD, THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPAND UPON POINTS MADE IN THE KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE 9TH ANNUAL EABIS COLLOQUIUM ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND EMERGING MARKETS HELD IN ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA ON 20-21 SEPTEMBER 2010. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THREE THEMES ARE EXPLORED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BRICS: GEOPOLITICS AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY; THE BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC GOOD AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE; AND FRAMEWORKS FOR EQUITABLE TRADE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH. FINDINGS - THE GLOBAL SITUATION IS PRECARIOUS, CHARACTERIZED BY MULTI-POLARITY, ASYMMETRICAL POWER THREATS, AND A VACUUM IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. THE TRADE-BASED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRICS IS A POSITIVE ECONOMIC SIGN BUT RAISES IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABILITY. THERE IS A NEED FOR BALANCE BETWEEN THE ABILITY OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO PROVIDE PUBLIC GOODS, INCLUDING GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS, AND THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND UNLEASH ITS CREATIVITY AND ENERGY. WITH THE PROPER INCENTIVES AND LEGAL STRUCTURE, INCLUDING RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE ENERGY AND CREATIVITY OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN BE HARNESSED TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR EQUITABLE TRADE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH, AND TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL MARKET ECONOMY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER PROVIDES A CATALYST FOR DISCUSSION THAT BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN BUSINESS SCHOOL EDUCATION, LEGAL EDUCATION, POLITICAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS.
895	NIGERIA IS A DEEPLY DIVIDED MULTIETHNIC STATE PAR EXCELLENCE. EVERY ETHNIC GROUP HAS ITS UNIQUE SOCIO-CULTURAL AND POLITICAL ECONOMY PATTERNS. AS HUMANS INTERACT DAILY, THERE ARE CLASHES IN SOME INTERACTIONS DUE TO UNCOORDINATED AND DIVERGENT INTERESTS OF THE INVOLVING PARTIES. THE FARMERS' AND HERDERS' CLASHES ARE DIMENSIONS OF SUCH INTERACTION IN NIGERIA. IN RECENT TIMES, THE RATE OF CLASHES AMONG THE HERDERS AND THE FARMERS HAD BECOME ALARMING. IT HAD COST THE COUNTRY A FORTUNE IN TERMS OF SOCIO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. FARMERS HAD ABANDONED FERTILE FARMLANDS DUE TO CATTLE INVASION WHICH DESTROYS TENDER CROPS. THE RESULTANT RESPONSES INCLUDE CATTLE RUSTLING AND KILLING OF TRESPASSING ANIMALS BY FARMERS WHILE THE HERDSMEN INVADE COMMUNITIES TO KILL EVERYONE POSSIBLE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAD BECOME INTERNALLY DISPLACED AND THE SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH THE STATE IS IN JEOPARDY. THE QUESTION THE PAPER SEEKS ANSWER TO IS DOES THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR OF NIGERIA HAVE A VIABLE POLICY PROSPECT WITH THE FREQUENT FARMERS AND HERDERS' CLASHES? CONFLICT THEORY WILL BE USE TO EXPLAIN FARMERS-HERDSMEN CLASHES PHENOMENON. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PREMISED ON GOOD NEIGHBOURLINESS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
896	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF EUROPEAN VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) LAW IN RELATION TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE TREATMENT AND FISCAL CONSEQUENCES OF PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGIES, CONSUMER-TO-CONSUMER MODELS, AND BARTER TRANSACTIONS. THE ARTICLE'S AIM IS TO ASSESS WHETHER PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE FIELD AND TO DISCUSS THE MOST RECENT LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL CONCERNS IN DETAIL AND ASSESSES CURRENT REGULATIONS THROUGH THE LENS OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CORNERSTONE OF EUROPEAN LAW THAT MUST BE RESPECTED.
897	THE AUTHOR FORMULATES SOME PROPOSITIONS WHICH TOGETHER MAKE UP THE CONCEPT OF CONTEMPORARY CRIMINAL LAW, ANALYZES THE ASSOCIATED DEMANDS ON THE CRIMINAL LEGISLATION AND SHOWS THE DIRECTIONS FOR ITS IMPROVEMENTS. THE AUTHOR ALSO ARGUES FOR THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL LAW SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT AHEAD OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY BECAUSE THIS LAW, JUST LIKE ALL LAWS TOGETHER, SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY, TO THE RENOVATION OF ALL FORMS OF LIVE ACTIVITY, TO CIVILIZED AND PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT.
898	IN 2012 THE MEXICAN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM CONFRONTED A NEW KIND OF ALTERNATION OF GOVERNMENTS. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS CHALLENGE WAS THE ELECTORAL RECOVERY OF THE PRI, WHICH SEEMED CERTAIN TO WIN, REPRESENTING FOR SOME A RETURN TO AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THE ESSAY CONSIDERS THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE LIGHT OF ANALYSIS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL MATURITY OF POLITICAL CHANGES (ELECTORAL, IN COMPETENCY AND PARTICIPATION, RELATIONS BETWEEN BRANCHES OF POWER AND BETWEEN THE FEDERATION AND THE STATES), AND CONCLUDES THAT SUCH A RETURN TO THE PAST IS UNLIKELY. HOWEVER, THIS CONCLUSION DOES NOT MEAN THAT DEMOCRACY IS BECOMING ENTRENCHED, GIVEN THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY NUMEROUS INFORMAL PRACTICES SUCH AS CLIENTELISM, CORPORATISM, CORRUPTION AND THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW.
899	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ARTICULATE A PLAUSIBLE THEORETICAL POSITION THAT HELPS OVERCOME THE LONGSTANDING DISPUTE BETWEEN THE TWO MAIN CONCEPTIONS IN CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY: THE "LEGAL" AND "POLITICAL" CONSTITUTIONALISMS. THIS THIRD POSITION WANTS TO OCCUPY AN INTERMEDIATE TERRAIN OF RECONCILIATION: ON THE ONE HAND, IT DEFENDS THE ESSENTIALLY LEGAL NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND, THUS, THE INEVITABLE AND IRREPLACEABLE ROLE OF JUDGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS; ON THE OTHER HAND, IT VINDICATES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE POLITICAL POWERS IN THE DEFINITION OF BASIC RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, DENYING THE JUDGES' MONOPOLY OR SUPREMACY IN CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO BUILD A DEMOCRATIC CULTURE OF JUSTIFICATION WHERE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW (INCLUDING THE PROTECTION OF BASIC RIGHTS) IS ASSUMED AS A COMMON PROJECT IN WHICH ALL BRANCHES FULFIL THEIR ROLE RESPECTING EACH OTHER'S INDEPENDENCE.
900	IN THIS PAPER I DISCUSS THE POLITICAL VALUE OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THE CLASSICAL ACCOUNTS OF PRIVACY DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PRIVACY AS THE RIGHT OF A CITIZEN AGAINST OTHER CITIZENS VS. THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AS THE RIGHT AGAINST THE STATE OR THE GOVERNMENT. I SHALL ARGUE THAT THIS DISTINCTION SHOULD BE MADE, SINCE THE NEW CONTEXT OF THE PRIVACY DEBATE HAS SURPASSED THE HISTORICAL FRAMES IN WHICH THE INTELLIGENCE METHODS USED BY GOVERNMENTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS. I ALSO PRESENT CASES IN WHICH POLITICAL PRIVACY SERVES AS AN INSTRUMENT OF PROTECTING IMPORTANT COLLECTIVE AGENDAS EXCEEDING THE CONTEXT OF PERSONAL PRIVACY. I ARGUE THAT DUE TO ITS FUNCTION, POLITICAL PRIVACY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, IMPOSING LEGAL BOUNDS ON GOVERNMENTS' DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS.
901	THIS TEXT ANALYSES THE, FIRST APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 155 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION IN CATALONIA. IT LAYS OUT THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS APPLICATION OCCURRED AND THE PHILOSOPHY ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFII SUCH A MEASURE. TO THIS END, THE PAPER USES THE CONCEPT OF DUAL STATE PROPOSED BY ERNST FRAENKEL, WHO MAINTAINS THAT SPAIN IS A DUAL STATE THAT IS INCREASING THE SPACE OF THE PREROGATIVE STATE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE NORMATIVE STATE. THIS THESIS IS EVIDENCED BY A REVIEW OF A SERIES OF INDICATORS THAT AFFECT ALL THE POWERS OF THE STATE. CARL SCHMITT'S PHILOSOPHY UNIFIES THIS INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, AND WITH IT, THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 155 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION, THROUGH THE CONCEPTS OF SOVEREIGNTY, POLITICS, ENEMY AND EXCEPTIONAL SITUATION. ALL THIS WILL LEAD TO A HYPOSTASIS OF NATIONAL UNITY AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
902	COMPLEX RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRIME, LAW, AND REGIME CHANGE ARE EXPLORED THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE STABILIZING FUNCTION OF LAW FOR POLITICAL REGIMES AND THE RISKS FOR REGIME STABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKENED RULE OF LAW AND STATE CRIME. THE LITERATURE ON EXPERIENCES FROM STATE SOCIALIST REGIMES PROMPTS QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE OF WESTERN INTERVENTIONIST STATES, ESPECIALLY DURING PERIODS OF TIGHTENING GOVERNMENT CONTROL. THE SECOND PART EXAMINES CRIME AND LAW DURING AND AFTER REGIME CHANGE. THE FOCUS IS ON (A) LEGAL RESPONSES TO PAST STATE CRIMES (OR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE), ESPECIALLY CRIMINAL TRIALS, AND EFFECTS OF SUCH RESPONSES, PARTLY MEDIATED BY COLLECTIVE MEMORIES, ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY RECORDS OF NEW REGIMES AND (B) SOCIETAL CRIME RATES AFTER TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY AND THE ROLE OF LAW IN RESPONSE TO RAPID INCREASES OF CRIME IN POSTTRANSITION SITUATIONS.
903	ETHICS SHOULD PROMOTE, SUSTAIN, INSPIRE AND COMPLEMENT THE LAW, ALTHOUGH, UNDER SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, IT IS REQUIRED THE ENTIRE SUBMISSION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TO LAW. PUBLIC EMPLOYEE'S DUTY OF ABSTENTION, WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN SITUATIONS DETERMINED BY LAW AS UNDER THE RISK OF PARTIALITY OR SERVICE TO PARTICULAR INTERESTS AND NOT TO PUBLIC PURPOSES, IS ONLY A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE THAT SEARCH FOR THE BEST GUARANTEE OF EFFECTIVE SUBMISSION TO LAW OF ALL PUBLIC POWER PROCEEDINGS AND PROMOTE CITIZEN'S TRUST IN THEIR AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. DUTY OF ABSTENTION WAS BUILT IN XX CENTURY FROM THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF RECUSATION WHICH IS HISTORICALLY DEEP-ROOTED IN LEGAL FIELD, AND IT IS INCLUDED IN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. COMPARISON OF REGULATIONS BETWEEN PERUVIAN AND SPANISH LAW IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE FIELD PROMOTE AN ANALYSIS OF LEGAL SYSTEM PARTICULARITIES.
904	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THE STATUS OF EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CITIZENSHIP AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IT OPERATES FROM THE PREMISE THAT RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH EU CITIZENSHIP ARE INHERENTLY UNDERLINED BY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION. THE CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH THIS QUESTION IS ANSWERED IS THAT OF THE FOUR RECENT "CRISES" FACED BY THE EU SINCE THE TREATY OF LISBON, NAMELY, THE EUROZONE, MIGRATION AND RULE OF LAW CRISES AND BREXIT. THESE EXAMPLES SERVE TO HIGHLIGHT HOW THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU'S APPARENT CHOICE NOT TO FULLY INTEGRATE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS INTO EU CITIZENSHIP CASE LAW AFFECTS THE FUNDAMENTALITY OF EU CITIZENSHIP STATUS, AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY HAILED TO BE. IT ARGUES THAT THERE IS A CASE TO BE MADE FOR A STRONGER ROLE FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION AS PART OF THE FUTURE OF EU CITIZENSHIP'S STATUS.
905	THE AMERICAN LEAD WAR ON TERRORISM HAS PROVOKED A LOT OF CRITICISM. NOTABLE CRITICS LIKE GIORGIO AGAMBEN HAVE POINTED TO THE WAR ON TERRORISM'S INTENTIONAL UNDERMINING OF THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STATES OF EXCEPTION PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE DETENTION CENTER IN GUANTANAMO BAY CUBA. THIS EXISTENCE OF THIS INSTITUTION HAS BEEN MET WITH ALMOST UNIVERSAL CONDEMNATION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AUSTRALIA AND CANADA. THOSE STATES SEEMED TO ABANDON THEIR CITIZENS TO EXCEPTION BY PROXY. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION CENTER AS AN INSTRUMENT OF A STATE OF EXCEPTION AND THE PROCESSES OF EXCEPTION BY PROXY THAT AUSTRALIA AND CANADA PARTICIPATED IN.
906	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE RECENT (25 YEARS), DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, ESPECIALLY IN POLAND AS THE COUNTRY IN THE REGION WHERE THE FIRST NON-COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989. IT HIGHLIGHTS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND HAZARDOUS CHALLENGE FOR FORMER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES WHEN TACKLING THE PROCESS ON TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS - POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC. THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO ACHIEVE A UNIFORM PUBLIC CONSENSUS ON THE CHOSEN ROAD TO ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. THE GOVERNMENTS FACED MANY OBSTACLES, INCLUDING PUBLIC APATHY. IT WAS EASIER TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR POLITICAL CHANGES. A COMMON TENDENCY IN ALL THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNIST RULE WAS A RETURN TO TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES DEVELOPED BY THE WESTERN CONSTITUTIONALISM, I.E. THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL PLURALISM, GUARANTEES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, BASED ON HUMAN DIGNITY, AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. IT WAS DONE BY ADOPTION OF NEW CONSTITUTIONS OR SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE OLD ONES. IN NEW DEMOCRACIES, HOWEVER NEW THREATS HAVE APPEARED, HAVING SOME IMPACT ON THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY AND STATE OF LAW IN THESE COUNTRIES, IT IS ESPECIALLY AN INSTRUMENTAL APPROACH TO THE LAW. ARTICLE SHOWS IT BY EXAMPLE OF LUSTRATION LAWS. DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTIES, POST-COMMUNISTS CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAS UNDERTAKEN IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL REFORMS IN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREA WHICH HELPED THEM "TO RETURN TO EUROPE".
907	ON THE ONE HAND, THE ROUND TABLE IS A HISTORICAL EVENT, BECAUSE IT TOOK PLACE IN 1989; ON THE OTHER HAND, HOWEVER, IT MAY BE REGARDED AS A CURRENT ONE, AS IT WAS REFERRED TO BY POLITICIANS IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS IN 2017, WITH REFERENCE TO THE REFORM OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN POLAND. IN AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY THE CHANGES POSTULATED BY THE POLITICAL GROUP OF THE UNITED RIGHT, DEPUTIES SPOKE OF THE NEED TO OVERCOME THE PROVISIONS OF THE ROUND TABLE REGARDED AS THE SOURCE OF PATHOLOGY AND INABILITY TO CREATE A WELL-FUNCTIONING SYSTEM OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE POLITICIANS, SCHOLARS AND JOURNALISTS TAKING PART IN THE DEBATE ON THE JUDICIAL REFORM IN POLAND PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE AT THE ROUND TABLE, AS PARTICIPANTS OF LAW AND COURT REFORM WORKGROUP. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANSWER THE TITLE QUESTION: STAGNATION OR CHANGE?, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SUCH KEY ISSUES AS THE IMPORTANCE AND MANNER OF CREATING THE LAW, UNDERSTANDING THE RULE OF LAW, INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF THE RULE OF LAW.
908	IN THE CONTEXT OF 'HYBRID WARFARE' AS 21ST CENTURY'S THREAT TO PEACE AND SECURITY, THIS PAPER INTENDS TO ADDRESS THE ROLE OF LAWFARE. THE USE OF LAW AS A WEAPON, LAWFARE,(1) CAN HAVE A TANGIBLE IMPACT ON DEMOCRATIC STATES WHEN THEIR ADVERSARIES USE IT IN AN EXPLOITATIVE WAY. LAWFARE CAN BE USED IN THE CONTEXT OF HYBRID WAR.(2) EXAMPLES OF HYBRID WARFARE AS WITNESSED IN THE RUSSIAN/UKRAINIAN CONFLICT OF 2014/2015 AND THE ONGOING CONFLICT WITH DAESH ARE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO LAWFARE DUE TO AN APPARENT ASYMMETRIC ADHERENCE TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AMONG INVOLVED ACTORS. THE DIFFERENT LEGAL AND ETHICAL APPROACH OF DEMOCRATIC STATES IN WARFARE AND THEIR - NON-DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS IN HYBRID WAR SCENARIOS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON THE EVENTUAL PROMPT SUCCESS OF WESTERN MILITARY ACTIONS. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT AGAINST THIS BACKDROP IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR LAW-ABIDING NATIONS TO ADAPT AN APPROACH WHICH USES COUNTER-LAWFARE MEANS IN SUPPORT OF ITS OWN LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVES AND TO PREVENT OPPONENTS FROM USING IT LAW AS A WEAPON FOR THEIR OWN STRATEGIC PURPOSES.
909	SLOVENIA, UNTIL RECENTLY A "SUCCESS STORY" OF THE TRANSITION FROM COMMUNISM TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, IS EXPERIENCING ITS BIGGEST CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL CRISIS SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE IN 1991. THE SLOVENIAN CONSTITUTIONAL MODEL IS CURRENTLY FACING A SIMULTANEOUS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPLE REASONS FOR THIS APPARENT DECLINE OF THE SLOVENIAN MODEL. FIRST, BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVELY PRIVILEGED POSITION VIS-A-VIS OTHER EAST CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, SLOVENIA HAS BEEN A RELUCTANT REFORMER, DOING VERY LITTLE TO ACTUALLY CHANGE ITS INSTITUTIONAL SETUP FROM THE COMMUNIST PAST. SECOND, WHEN SLOVENIA IMPLEMENTED REFORMS, IT DID IT IN A VERY PARTICULAR WAY: AS AN UNCRITICAL MODEL-TAKER OF POLICY MODELS FROM THE WEST. THIS MIMICRY WAS DONE IN A FAIRLY TOP DOWN, BUREAUCRATIC WAY, CREATING INSTITUTIONS WITHOUT DEEP ENOUGH ROOTS IN SOCIETY, AND WITHOUT NECESSARY TRIAL AND ERROR STYLE USUALLY NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL EVALUATION OF PROPOSED REFORMS.

910	I DEFEND A FORM OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION THROUGH THE CREATION OF AN OFFENCE OF 'BEING A PERSISTENT VIOLENT DANGEROUS OFFENDER' (PVDO). THIS DIFFERS FROM ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS AND ACTUAL HABITUAL OFFENDER LAWS THAT IMPOSE EXTRA PERIODS OF INCARCERATION ON OFFENDERS AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED THE SENTENCE FOR THEIR MOST RECENT CRIME(S) OR AS A RESULT OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS (AS IN THREE STRIKES LAWS). I, INSTEAD, WOULD MAKE 'BEING A PERSISTENT VIOLENT DANGEROUS OFFENDER' AN OFFENCE ITSELF. PERSONS TO BE PREVENTIVELY DETAINED (IMPRISONED) WOULD BE TRIED AND CONVICTED OF THIS OFFENCE (ON THE USUAL STANDARDS OF PROOF AND AFTER A CRIMINAL TRIAL IN WHICH THEY ENJOYED ALL THE NORMAL PROTECTIONS OF DUE PROCESS AND JUST CRIMINAL PROCEDURE). MY APPROACH WOULD THEN HAVE ONE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE: PROVIDED THE ELEMENTS OF BEING A PVDO COULD BE RENDERED SUFFICIENTLY DETERMINATE, PUNISHING PERSONS UNDER SUCH AN OFFENCE WOULD COMPORT WITH CENTRAL RULE OF LAW VALUES, MOST IMPORTANTLY LEGALITY AND FAIR NOTICE, AS WELL AS PRINCIPLES OF PROPORTIONALITY IN SENTENCING.
911	INSTEAD OF A PUBLIC LAW FRAGMENTED INTO DISCRETE DEPARTMENTS, WE SHOULD ENVISAGE A UNIFIED SCHEME OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND LEGAL STANDARDS, EXPRESSING A COHERENT MORAL THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THAT MORAL THEORY UNDERPINS ALL LEGITIMATE LEGAL ORDERS, PROPERLY RESPECTFUL OF HUMAN DIGNITY; AND COMMON LAW ADJUDICATION IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS THE WORKING OUT, ACCORDING TO CONTEXT, OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY. AN INITIAL FOCUS ON MORE LOCAL LEGAL TRADITION ULTIMATELY LEADS TO A BROADER INQUIRY ABOUT THE TRUE DEMANDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, OFFERING THE PROSPECT OF A LARGER VISION OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM. WHILE JEREMY WALDRON HAS DOUBTED THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN LEGAL ANALYSIS AND MORAL REASONING -REJECTING AN ANALOGY WITH RAWLSIAN REFLECTIVE EQUILIBRIUM -HIS VIEW MAY BE CONTESTED. A COMMON LAW JUDGE WHO ATTEMPTS TO REASON MORALLY IN THE NAME OF THE WHOLE SOCIETY, IN THE MANNER SUGGESTED BY RONALD DWORKIN'S THEORY OF INTEGRITY, MUST TAKE ACCOUNT OF THOSE LEGAL TEXTS AND PRECEDENTS THAT POLITICAL MORALITY MAKES PERTINENT. LEGAL REASONING IS SIMPLY MORAL REASONING, ATTENTIVE TO HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT.
912	THIS ANALYSIS CONSIDERS BUSHFIRE SURVIVORS FOR CLIMATE ACTION INCORPORATED V ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY [2021] NSWLEC 92, IN WHICH AN AUSTRALIAN ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AUTHORITY WAS ISSUED A MANDAMUS TO COMPEL IT TO PERFORM A PUBLIC DUTY TO DEVELOP INSTRUMENTS TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. BROUGHT BY A GROUP OF CLIMATE ACTIVISTS AFFECTED BY BUSHFIRE, IT IS THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL ACTION-FORCING CASE OF ITS KIND IN AUSTRALIA. CASES THAT SEEK TO FILL THE GAPS IN DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE REGIMES VIA THE COURTS RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE ROLE OF THE COURTS IN ADVANCING CLIMATE POLICY. THEY ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO ENFORCE THE LAW AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WHERE IT HAS LAGGED. IN THIS ARTICLE, I PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CASE IN LIGHT OF THESE ASPECTS, AND ADDITIONALLY CONSIDER THE ROLE THAT CLIMATE SCIENCE PLAYED IN THE COURTROOM.
913	THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY EVALUATES THE CHARACTERISATION OF SEDITION LAW AS COLONIAL BY ANALYSING THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY J. F. STEPHEN IN OPPOSING SUCH A CLAIM. WHILE STEPHEN OBFUSCATED THE CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN THE SEDITION LAW AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF COLONIAL GOVERNANCE, HE MADE A PERSUASIVE CASE FOR HOW THE SEDITION LAW WAS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH BRITISH IDEAS OF LIBERTY, UTILITY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. STEPHEN'S ARGUMENTS ABOUT LEGITIMATE LIMITS TO POLITICAL LIBERTIES, PARTICULARLY HIS CRITIQUE OF J. S. MILL IN THIS REGARD, OFFER US AN OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THE PRESUMED ANTITHESIS BETWEEN COLONIAL AND METROPOLITAN JURISPRUDENCE AND TRACE THEIR SHARED ORIGINS IN BRITISH POLITICAL THOUGHT. TO THAT END, WITH STEPHEN AS AN INTERLOCUTOR, THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY ANALYSES THEMES SUCH AS THE DEFENCE OF EMPIRE, COLONIALISM, AND THE IDEA OF IMPROVEMENT WITHIN A WIDER SET OF WRITINGS BY BRITISH POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS, TO ARRIVE AT AN ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF BRITISH POLITICAL LIBERALISM. MY ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT RATHER THAN 'COLONIAL DIFFERENCE', THE CONSTITUTIVE RELATION BETWEEN SEDITION LAW AND LIBERAL JURISPRUDENCE BETTER EXPLAINS THE PREVALENCE OF SIMILAR AUTHORITARIAN LAWS WITHIN DEMOCRATIC REGIMES ACROSS THE GLOBE.
914	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND WHY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW SHOULD PROTECT CORPORATIONS AT THE EXAMPLE OF REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION. FOR THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE, GRANTING HUMAN RIGHTS TO CORPORATIONS IS THE NATURAL RESPONSE TO THE KEY ROLE THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES PLAY IN THE INTEGRATION PROGRAM. REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS, IN CONTRAST, PARTLY STRUGGLE TO RECOGNISE CORPORATIONS AS HUMAN RIGHTS HOLDERS. THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE THEORETICAL RAISON D'ETRE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CORPORATIONS, GRANTED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS, AND REFLECTS ON THEM ON THE BASIS OF A RULE OF LAW-POSTULATE.
915	ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF AUTOCRATIZING GOVERNMENTS IN REGIMES WITH NOMINALLY DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IS HOW TO REPRESS FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS WHILE CLAIMING TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. POST-9/11 SOCIO-LEGAL DEBATES POINT TO THE EMERGENCY RULE AS A LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONS THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY USED TO HOLLOW OUT CITIZENS' RIGHTS. BUT THE STUDY OF EMERGENCY RULE IS OFTEN LIMITED TO ITS ENACTMENT UNDER EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS. THIS ARTICLE TAKES THE CRUCIAL CASE OF TURKEY'S AUTHORITARIAN TRANSFORMATION AND DEVELOPS THE CONCEPT OF MOBILE EMERGENCY RULE TO ARGUE THAT EMERGENCY-LIKE SUSPENSIONS OF RIGHTS ALSO OCCUR IN HIGHLY LOCALIZED AND TEMPORARY FORMS IN THE ABSENCE OF AN OFFICIALLY DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY. BASED ON AN ORIGINAL DATASET, IT EXAMINES ALL LEGAL BANS ON PROTESTS ISSUED BY AUTHORITIES BETWEEN 2007 AND 2018 IN THE NAME OF MAINTAINING ORDER AND SECURITY. THE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE HOW THE USE OF THIS TOOL DOVETAILED WITH KEY TURNING POINTS OF AUTHORITARIAN TRANSFORMATION IN TURKEY AND REFLECTED THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE REGIME AS IT TRIED TO BUILD AND SUSTAIN A NEW HEGEMONIC PROJECT. IN EFFECT, MOBILE EMERGENCY RULE CREATED A HIGHLY AMBIGUOUS TERRAIN FOR PROTEST RIGHTS EVEN BEFORE THE DECLARATION OF STATE OF EMERGENCY IN JULY 2016.
916	ONE UNFORESEEN POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE OF PEOPLE'S DISCONTENT WITH AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN DEMOCRACIES IN LATIN AMERICA HAS BEEN THE ARRIVAL OF PRESIDENCIES WITH EXECUTIVE UNLIMITED POWERS AND WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL COUNTERBALANCE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO TWO DEEPLY LINKED OBJECTIVES: A) AFTER THE FIGURE OF CAESAR AND HIS PROGRAMMATIC TRANSLATION AS CAESARISM, IT OFFERS A READING KEY REGARDING THE UNWANTED POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF CURRENT DISCONTENT WITH -AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN- DEMOCRACY; AND B) IT SHOWS A POSSIBLE ANSWER CONCERNING THE EMERGENCE OF CAESARISM AS A PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME IN LATIN AMERICA -PARTICULARLY IN CASES SUCH AS HUGO CHAVEZ AND NICOLAS MADURO'S, AND VENEZUELAN "CHAVISM"- AFTER WHAT I WILL CALL THE "REPUBLICAN ARCHITECTURE". BY TAKING SOME NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES FROM REPUBLICANISM (I. E., FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION AND RULE OF LAW) I PRESENT THE READER WITH AN ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM OF THE EMERGENCE OF CAESARIST PRESIDENTIAL GOVERNMENTS.
917	THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IN PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNMENT IN A COUNTRY TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW PREVAILS AND TO AVOID THE MASSES FROM BEING THE MERE TOOLS OF THE CAPRICIOUS ELITE. THE JUDICIARY BEING THE ARBITER OF DISPUTE PLAYS AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN BRINGING LIFE TO THE BLACK LETTERS OF THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION. IN THIS REGARD, THE ARTICLE TENTATIVELY LOOKS AT THE CONTRIBUTION OF A FORMER SUPREME COURT JUDGE, TAN SRI HARUN M. HASHIM ON HIS APPROACH TO INTERPRETING FUNDAMENTAL LIBERTIES AND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT. THE DISTILLATION OF APPROACHES OF ONE OF THE PROMINENT JUDGES OF MALAYSIA MAY BETTER INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO LOOKS AT HIS CONTRIBUTION IN RAISING AWARENESS ON HUMAN RIGHTS DURING HIS TENURE AS THE VICE-CHAIRMAN OF SUHAKAM. THE ARTICLE ADOPTS A DOCTRINAL METHOD BY PROBING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, RELATED STATUTES AND CASE LAW. SECONDARY SOURCES INCLUDING JOURNAL ARTICLES ARE EXAMINED TO PROVIDE REVIEWS AND OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE RELATED LEGAL AREAS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH THE FINDING OF THE CONTINUING INFLUENCE OF THE JUDGMENT AND WRITINGS OF TAN SRI HARUN M. HASHIM IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF LAW INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, CONTEMPT OF COURTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
918	WHAT SHOULD THE EU DO ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME MEMBER STATES ARE BACKSLIDING ON THEIR COMMITMENTS TO DEMOCRACY, SUPPOSEDLY A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF THE EU? THE TREATY PROVISIONS UNDER ARTICLE 7 TEU ARE WIDELY CRITICIZED FOR BEING INEFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING SUCH DEVELOPMENTS. ARE THEY LEGITIMATE? I ARGUE THAT THE ULTIMATE SANCTION OF ARTICLE 7 TEU FALLS INTO A PERFORMATIVE CONTRADICTION, WHICH UNDERMINES ITS ABILITY TO COHERENTLY DEFEND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES. INSTEAD, EXPULSION FROM THE EU IS THE APPROPRIATE, COHERENT AND LEGITIMATE FINAL POLITICAL SANCTION FOR DEMOCRATIC AND RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING BY A MEMBER STATE. THE ARGUMENT HAS THE FOLLOWING STEPS: IN PART 1, I ARGUE THAT THE CURRENT ARTICLE 7 FRAMEWORK FOR RESPONDING TO DEMOCRATIC AND RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN THE EU IS NORMATIVELY PROBLEMATIC, IN THAT THE MECHANISM CURRENTLY IN THE TREATY UNDERMINES THE VALUES IT PURPORTS TO DEFEND; IN OTHER WORDS, IT FALLS INTO A PERFORMATIVE CONTRADICTION. IT IS UNDEMOCRATIC TO DEPRIVE MEMBER STATES OF THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE COUNCIL WHILE HOLDING THEM SUBJECT TO COUNCIL DECISIONS. HOWEVER, PART 2 STUDIES RELEVANT PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS FROM AN ADJACENT LITERATURE ON CRIMINAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT, CONCLUDING THAT ALLOWING BACKSLIDING MEMBER STATES TO KEEP THEIR VOTING RIGHTS IN THE COUNCIL ALSO TAINTS THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF COUNCIL DECISION-MAKING. IN PART 3, I CONSIDER THE RESULTING PARADOX IN LIGHT OF THE LITERATURE ON MILITANT DEMOCRACY. COULD MILITANT DEMOCRACY JUSTIFY ARTICLE 7? I ARGUE NOT; EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THE HYPOTHETICAL JUSTIFIABILITY OF MILITANT MEASURES, THEY ARE NOT LEGITIMATE HERE SINCE A DEMOCRATICALLY ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE EXISTS THAT WOULD SAFEGUARD THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER AND LEGITIMACY OF COUNCIL DECISION-MAKING: EXPULSION FROM THE UNION. I ALSO ADDRESS A CENTRAL OBJECTION TO AN EXPULSION MECHANISM-THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE TREATY CHANGE AND IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
919	IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RECHTSSTAAT IN BOTH GERMANY AND ELSEWHERE IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA, AND SEEKS TO ARGUE THAT THE TERM, FOR REASONS EMPIRICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL, HAS BECOME EXCESSIVELY VAGUE AND, THEREFORE, ALMOST MEANINGLESS AS A HISTORICALLY DESCRIPTIVE WORD AND FORM OF LEGAL POLITY. THE ARTICLE URGES A RETURN TO A RIGOROUSLY HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RECHTSSTAAT IN ORDER TO RESTORE CENTRALITY TO THE ROLE OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND STATE POWER IN THE BROAD SWEEP OF GERMAN LIFE AND, BY EXTENSION, THROUGHOUT CONTINENTAL EUROPE, AND IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN DISTINCTIONS AMONG WESTERN LEGAL WAYS AND TRADITIONS, IN THIS CASE THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTINENTAL, CIVIL LAW NOTION OF THE RECHTSSTAAT AND THE ANGLO-AMERICAN, COMMON LAW THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARGUMENT PROCEEDS ALONG TWO MAJOR TRACKS. FIRST, THE AUTHOR EXPLORES THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH-CENTURY ORIGINS OF THE RECHSSTAAT IDEA AND ITS POWERFULLY STATE-CENTERED IDENTITY AMIDST COUNTERVAILING LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC CURRENTS, AND HOW SUCH STATISM HAS PERSISTED IN GERMAN HISTORY AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE UP THROUGH THE CONTEMPORARY ERA. HISTORICAL, LEGAL, AND PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS ON THE RECHTSSTAAT, BOTH WITHIN AND BEYOND GERMAN BORDERS, CONSTITUTE THE FOCUS OF THE ANALYSIS. THE ARGUMENT'S SECOND PRINCIPAL LINE OF EXPOSITION IS A CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE RECHTSSTAAT CONCEPT ON THE WEST'S STUDY OF THE HISTORY OF RUSSIAN LAW AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY IN THE LATE IMPERIAL ERA. IN DELINEATING THE COURSE OF WESTERN ACADEMICS' INTERPRETATION OF RUSSIA'S RECENT MODERNIZING PAST-PARTICULARLY IN CONTRAST TO THE WRITINGS OF PRE-REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIANS-THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE GRADUAL MERGING OF RECHTSSTAAT PRINCIPLES WITH INDIGENOUS RUSSIAN LEGAL VALUES AND EUROPEAN INTELLECTUAL BORROWINGS, THE EVENTUAL, POST-1945 GLOBAL TRIUMPH OF ANGLO-AMERICAN EXPECTATIONS FOR MODERN, DEVELOPED LEGAL LIFE, AND FINALLY THE ASSIMILATION OF THE RECHTSSTAAT IDEA TO THE NOW GLOBALLY BROADCAST STANDARDS AND VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW MODEL.
920	RECENTLY, THE IDEA OF PHRONESIS HAS ASSUMED GREAT IMPORTANCE AMONG POLITICAL THEORISTS. THIS PROMINENCE IS DUE TO THE PERCEPTION THAT, CONTRARY TO THE APPLICATION OF THE METHODS OF NATURAL SCIENCE TO POLITICS, PHRONESIS PRESERVES THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF POLITICS IN IFS REFUSAL TO APPLY INAPPROPRIATE STANDARDS OF PRECISION AND TO FIND CERTAINTY WHERE IT DOES NOT EXIST. BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THIS, THE FOLLOWING QUESTION ARISES CAN WE ASCERTAIN A NONARBITRARY STANDARD OF PHRONESIS WITHOUT DENYING THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS? I ADDRESS THIS QUESTION BY CONSIDERING THE TREATMENT OF PHRONESIS (WISDOM) FOUND IN PLATO'S STATESMAN AND IN PARTICULAR, THE PASSAGE THAT WEIGHS THE RELATIVE MERITS OF RULE BY WISDOM AND RULE BY LAW. IN THIS SEMINAL CONSIDERATION OF PHRONESIS PLATO (UNLIKE ARISTOTLE) DOES NOT CONFINE HIS TREATMENT TO THE PRACTICAL SPHERE; EVEN THIS INTENSELY POLITICAL PASSAGE CONTAINS FAR-REACHING REFLECTIONS ON THE NATURE OF HUMANITY AND THE WORLD WE INHABIT. THESE EXPLAIN WHAT WE ARE AND WHAT OUR WORLD IS, SUCH THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THIS COGNITIVE CAPACITY. AS I ARGUE THEY EXPRESS THE CONDITIONS OF PHRONESIS THAT CAN PROVIDE A GUIDE FOR IFS USE WITHOUT NEGATING ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTER.
921	THE SEPARATION-OF-POWERS LITERATURE HAS ENTERTAINED THE POSSIBILITY OF DIFFERENTIATING GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS AT A CONCEPTUAL, PRE-INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, AS A WAY OF DEFINING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. HOWEVER, IT CAN BE OBJECTED THAT ATTEMPTS AT DIFFERENTIATING FUNCTIONS AT THIS LEVEL CANNOT ESCAPE A PROBLEM OF ARBITRARINESS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DEVELOP AN ACCOUNT OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS WHICH ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM. ON MY ACCOUNT, THE LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION IS DEFINED BY THE CREATION OF VALIDITY CLAIMS, UNDERSTOOD AS CLAIMS MAKING IT A MATTER OF NORMATIVE COMMON-KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH AND SUCH NORMATIVE ATTITUDES HOLD FOR THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AGENTS. THE EXECUTIVE-JUDICIAL FUNCTION IS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFICATION OF RIGHTS AND OTHER JURAL POSITIONS OUT OF THE VALIDITY CLAIMS. THIS ACCOUNT OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS THE DOUBLE ADVANTAGE THAT IT WORKS AT A CONCEPTUAL, PRE-INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, AND THAT IT IS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONS IN A NON-ARBITRARY MANNER. IN DEVELOPING THIS ACCOUNT, I ALSO CONSIDER ITS PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. I ARGUE THAT THE CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE EXECUTIVE-JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS IS EXPRESSIVE OF RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, AND THAT THIS MIGHT RENDER IT A SUFFICIENT BUT NOT NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS.
922	THOMAS AQUINAS USES THE JURIST PAULO AS A MODEL OF AUTHORITY AFTER HANS KELSE'S EXPOSITION OF HIS THEORY ABOUT THE "LEGAL NORM" AND THE "RULER OF LAW" SO, THE "REGULA IURIS" THAT IS TO SAY THE "NORMATIVE RULE" ARISES FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF CODIFIED SYSTEM FROM WHICH THERE ARE DIFFERENT NORMATIVE LEVELS TAKEN FROM THE IMPERIAL CONSTITUTIONS OR THE PONTIFICAL ONES. BUT THIS "REGULA IURIS" IS NOT ALL THE LAW BUT A RATIONAL STEP ("ALIQUALIS RATIO IURIS") TO HELP IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF LAW THAT GOES BEYOND THE NORMATIVE LIMITS AND THE FRAMES OF THE CODES.
923	THIS ARTICLE SKETCHES OUT THE NATURE OF LEGAL RESPONSES TO HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION IN GENERAL AND THE KOSOVO INTERVENTION IN PARTICULAR, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION GIVEN TO ARGUMENTS THAT WERE NOT MADE. THOUGH SOME POSSIBLE ARGUMENTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN OMITTED THROUGH OVERSIGHT, THE NATURE OF THE DISCUSSION SUGGESTS A VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AS ONE POLICY JUSTIFICATION AMONG OTHERS. THESE DEBATES ARE THEN SITUATED IN A BROADER HISTORICAL CONTEXT BY DRAWING PARALLELS BETWEEN THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK AND EARLIER HISTORICAL PERIODS IN WHICH NO BODY COMPARABLE TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL EXISTED. IT IS ARGUED THAT DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR, AND IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IN PARTICULAR, SUGGEST A REVERSION TO PRE-CHARTER PARADIGMS, WHERE THE COUNCIL EXISTS MERELY TO ADVISE MEMBER-STATES AND INTERNATIONAL ORDER IS CONTINGENT, ONCE MORE, ON THE GOODWILL OF THE POWERFUL. THE RELUCTANCE OF THE GREAT POWERS TO SUBMIT THEMSELVES TO LAW MAY YET HAVE A MORE LASTING EFFECT ON THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER THAN NATOS DECISION TO WAGE WAR ON BEHALF OF THE KOSOVO ALBANIANS.
924	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF CALLICLES AND THRASYMACHUS' POSITIONS. THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR INTERPRETING CALLICLES AS A CRITIC OF DEMOCRACY AND AS AN ARISTOCRATIC POLITICAL THINKER WHOSE POLITICAL VIEWS ARE CLOSER TO PLATO'S THAN IS USUALLY ASSUMED. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT CALLICLES DEFENDS A NATURAL RIGHT OF THE BEST CITIZENS TO RULE OVER THE CROWD. HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST TO PLATO, FOR CALLICLES THE RULE OF THE BEST SHOULD NOT AIM AT THE COMMON GOOD BUT AT THEIR PERSONAL ADVANTAGE. THE PAPER ALSO DISCUSSES THE VIEW THAT THRASYMACHUS IS JUST A SOCIOLOGIST OF POWER WHO DIAGNOSES WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN POLITICS (HENNING OTTMANN, MAX SALOMON). THIS INTERPRETATION IS STILL CURRENT, AND ENABLES US TO UNDERSTAND IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF LEGISLATION IN CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACIES. FINALLY, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THERE ARE REASONS TO UNDERSTAND THRASYMACHUS NOT ONLY AS A POLITICAL REALIST, BUT, SIMILAR TO PROTAGORAS, AS A MORAL SCEPTIC.
925	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE RIGHT TO STRIKE IN THE CONTEXT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA. THE MATTER IS DISCUSSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF DEVELOPMENTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANIZATION (ILO) IN 2012 WHERE THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIGHT TO STRIKE WAS QUESTIONED BY THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION OF EMPLOYERS (IOE) IN HIGHLY CONFRONTATIONAL AND CONTROVERSIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IN THE PROCESS PRESENTING A MAJOR POLITICAL CHALLENGE TO THE ILO SUPERVISORY BODIES AND THEIR VERY SURVIVAL. IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT THE IOE CLAIMS ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED, THAT THE POSITION OF THE ILO SUPERVISORY BODIES IS EASILY DEFENDED, AND THAT THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE IOE PRESENTS A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME BRIEF REFLECTIONS ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING FOR THE RIGHT TO STRIKE IN CHINA.
926	IN 2013, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT ITS NUCLEAR WAR PLANS WOULD BE "CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT" AND WOULD "APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF DISTINCTION AND PROPORTIONALITY AND SEEK TO MINIMIZE COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO CIVILIAN POPULATIONS AND CIVILIAN OBJECTS." IF PROPERLY APPLIED, THESE LEGAL PRINCIPLES CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON U.S. NUCLEAR DOCTRINE. THE PROHIBITION AGAINST TARGETING CIVILIANS MEANS THAT "COUNTERVALUE" TARGETING AND "MINIMUM DETERRENCE" STRATEGIES ARE ILLEGAL. THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTINCTION AND THE IMPERMISSIBILITY OF REPRISAL AGAINST CIVILIANS MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR THE UNITED STATES, CONTRARY TO WHAT IS IMPLIED IN THE 2018 NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW, TO INTENTIONALLY TARGET CIVILIANS EVEN IN REPRISAL FOR A STRIKE AGAINST U.S. OR ALLIED CIVILIANS. THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY PERMITS SOME, BUT NOT ALL, POTENTIAL U.S. COUNTERFORCE NUCLEAR ATTACKS AGAINST MILITARY TARGETS. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE MEANS THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST USE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS OR THE LOWEST-YIELD NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST LEGITIMATE MILITARY TARGETS. THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT ALSO RESTRICTS TARGETING OF AN ENEMY'S LEADERSHIP TO OFFICIALS IN THE MILITARY CHAIN OF COMMAND OR DIRECTLY PARTICIPATING IN HOSTILITIES, MEANING THAT BROAD TARGETING TO DESTROY AN ENEMY'S ENTIRE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IS UNLAWFUL.
927	EVER SINCE THE RESUMPTION OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION, THE DISCIPLINE OF LAW HAS ACHIEVED GREAT DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA. CHINA'S LEGAL TALENT CULTIVATION HAS MADE GREATER BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE SCOPE, LEVEL AND MODEL OF EDUCATION THAN THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL LAW EDUCATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER, COMPARED WITH COUNTRIES WITH A RELATIVELY MATURE LAW EDUCATION SYSTEM, CHINA STILL CANNOT SHAKE OFF SOME SHACKLES IN LEGAL TALENT TRAINING. FOR EXAMPLE, DUE TO THE LACK OF PRACTICAL TEACHING, A LARGE NUMBER OF LAW STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED SHOW A LACK OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND PRACTICAL ABILITIES. IN VIEW OF THIS, WE ARE FORCED TO RE-EXAMINE CHINESE LAW EDUCATION AND SEEK CORRESPONDING COUNTERMEASURES. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPARING CHINESE AND FOREIGN LEGAL TALENTS TRAINING MODELS, THIS PAPER BELIEVES THAT THE CULTIVATION OF CHINESE LEGAL TALENTS SHOULD FIRST CLARIFY THE GOALS OF TRAINING LEGAL PERSONNEL AT ALL LEVELS AND FURTHER INCREASE THE PRACTICE TEACHING CURRICULUM, SO AS TO GRADUALLY CULTIVATE THE BELIEFS OF LEGAL TALENTS IN THE LAW SO AS TO BETTER SERVE THE COUNTRY AND TO DELIVER QUALITY LEGAL TALENTS.
928	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF HOW ONE DETERMINES WHETHER A PERSON IS SUFFICIENTLY CONNECTED TO A STATE IN ORDER FOR AN OBLIGATION TO PAY TAX TO THAT STATE TO ARISE. IT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THE TAXATION OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNING OF THE CONNECTING FACTORS USED TO IMPOSE TAX ON INDIVIDUALS. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE VARIOUS TYPES OF THEORY OF TAXATION AND THEIR HISTORICAL ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING THE BENEFIT THEORY, THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC ALLEGIANCE AND THE ABILITY TO PAY THEORY, AND EXAMINES EACH AS A CANDIDATE THEORY FOR DEFINING AND ANALYSING CONNECTING FACTORS IN TAXATION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT NONE OF THE PRINCIPAL TAXATION THEORIES GIVES A GOOD ACCOUNT OF, OR PROVIDES A SOUND THEORETICAL BASIS FOR, DETERMINING HOW A PERSON'S CONNECTION TO A STATE SHOULD BE DETERMINED FOR TAX PURPOSES AND PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY, THE MEMBERSHIP THEORY OF TAXATION, WHICH IS THEN OUTLINED AND DISCUSSED.
929	THE RULINGS HANDED DOWN IN RECENT YEARS BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN RESPONSE TO PRELIMINARY RULINGS ON THE ADEQUACY OF THE RULES APPLICABLE IN THE SPANISH LEGAL SYSTEM TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES SET OUT IN THE DIRECTIVE 93/13 ON UNFAIR TERMS IN CONSUMER CONTRACTS, HIGHLIGHT THE OPPOSITION OF SOME OF THE RULES ANALYZED TO THE DIRECTIVE. THIS MOVES THE OBLIGATION OF RESULTS FOR THE COURTS AND GIVES RISE IN PRACTICE TO THE EXISTENCE OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA OF INTERPRETATION BEFORE IDENTICAL FACTUAL PREMISES, TO THE DETRIMENT OF PURPORTED LEGAL CERTAINTY THAT ENSURES THE CONFIDENCE OF CONSUMERS IN THE HIRING.
930	THIS PAPER OUTLINES AND EVALUATES THE NATURE OF TERRORISM AS PERPETRATED BY AL-QAEDA. TO BEGIN IT GRAPHS THE INSTITUTIONAL BLUEPRINT OF SOCIETY, AND IDENTIFIES THE UBIQUITOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE, MARKET AND CULTURE IN ANY SOCIETY. IT GOES ON TO DESCRIBE HOW PRIVATE MARKETS AND CULTURES ARE HARMED AND DIMINISHED BY THE RELATIVE EXPANSION OF THE STATE. AT SOME STAGE IN THIS RELATIVE EXPANSION, PRIVATE MARKETS AND CULTURES SIMPLY COLLAPSE. AT THIS POINT, A SOCIETAL BACKLASH ENSUES. AL-QAEDA, IN THIS SENSE, IS THE MODERN DAY COUP D'ETAT AGAINST THE OVERWHELMING POWER OF AN OVER-EXTENDED AUTOCRACY. THE PAPER EVALUATES THIS HYPOTHESIS THROUGH AN INSTITUTIONAL EXAMINATION, LARGELY FOCUSED ON SAUDI ARABIA, THE INITIAL HOMELAND OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, THE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE LEADER OF AL-QAEDA, AND CURRENT HOME TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CAUSE OF AL-QAEDA. UNDERSTANDING THE SPECIFIC AND PURPOSEFUL INSTITUTIONAL NEXUS FROM WHICH AL-QAEDA HAS EMERGED MUST BE A FIRST STEP IN ANY SYSTEMATIC ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE TERRORIST THREAT THAT IT POSES.
931	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A SKETCH AND A COMPARISON OF TWO PERSPECTIVES OF JUSTICE. I DISCUSS PLATO'S IDEA OF JUSTICE IN THE REPUBLIC (SECTION 2), AND MENCIUS' THINKING ON THE SAME TOPIC IN MENCIUS (SECTION 3). FOR PLATO, JUSTICE LEADS TO HARMONY AND REASON IS THE KEY ELEMENT, ESPECIALLY FOR GETTING HOLD OF THE GOOD, AND FOR UNIFYING THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SOUL SUCCESSFULLY; LIKEWISE, THE PHILOSOPHER SHOULD RULE THE POLIS FOR THE UNIFICATION OF THE THREE CLASSES OF PEOPLE IN THE POLIS. MENCIUS TREATS YI, THE CONCEPT WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO JUSTICE, SIMILARLY TO PLATO, NAMELY AS ONE'S PROPER RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS, EXCEPT ONE'S PARENTS WHO ARE NOT CONSIDERED AS OTHERS. FOR MENCIUS, YI IS SHOWN IN ONE'S LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO ACT APPROPRIATELY IN ALL THE SITUATIONS ONE ENCOUNTERS IN THE WORLD. REN IS SHOWN IN ONE'S LOVE OF OTHERS AND GUIDES ONE IN A MORE IMPORTANT WAY THAN REASON FOR ONE'S CULTIVATION OF YI. THE IDEAS OF LAW OF THE TWO PHILOSOPHERS ARE DISCUSSED NEXT (SECTION 4). THE RULE OF LAW IS INSTRUMENTAL FOR IMPROVING THE VIRTUE FOR THE COMMON PEOPLE AND IS CENTRAL TO PLATO'S ACCOUNT OF THE BEST CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, FOR MENCIUS, LAW IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT NORM. THIS DIFFERENCE IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR THE TWO PHILOSOPHERS, BUT ALSO FOR THE TWO TRADITIONS, THE GREEK AND THE CHINESE. I CONCLUDE THE PAPER BY SUMMARIZING KEY DIFFERENCES AND HOW THE TWO THOUGHTS MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER (SECTION 5).
932	THIS SYNTHETIC APPRAISAL OF THE COLLECTION OF PAPERS IN THIS ISSUE ARGUES THAT HISTORICAL INJUSTICE SATURATES THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY ARE LARGELY THOSE WHO ALREADY LACK RESOURCES - WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE WRONG END OF COLONIAL HISTORY, OR WHO HAVE BEEN GLOBALIZATION'S LOSERS, OR WHO HAVE SUFFERED NEGLECT, EXCLUSION OR SIMPLE RAPACITY AT THE HANDS OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS. THEY ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BENEFITTED LITTLE OR NOT AT ALL FROM A CARBON-INTENSIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY, BUT WHO HAVE LONG SUFFERED ITS SIDE EFFECTS - RESOURCE STRIPPING, FOOD PRICE SPIKES, IMPOVERISHMENT AND NOW THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FOLLOWING THE OTHER AUTHORS IN THIS ISSUE - AND EXAMINING HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, TRADE LAW AND THE OVERARCHING IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW - THE PAPER NOTES THAT THE PARTICULAR FORM TAKEN BY LAW IN INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS, HAVING LARGELY FOLLOWED THE HISTORICAL PROGRESS OF INDUSTRIALISM, COLONIALISM AND GLOBALIZATION, IS PECULIARLY ILL-SUITED TO THE TASK OF ADDRESSING THIS VULNERABILITY.
933	OBJECTIVE. CRITICAL CARE ETHICS FOCUSES LARGELY ON PATIENT AUTONOMY. COST CONTAINMENT IS NECESSARY BUT REQUIRES RATIONING AND LIMITATIONS ON A PATIENT'S RIGHT TO CONSUME BENEFICIAL SERVICES. NO LAWS ADDRESS A PROCESS OF AUTONOMY RIGHTS LIMITATION TO CONSUME RESOURCES IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. WE ANALYZED THE FRICTIONAL INTERFACE BETWEEN NECESSARY COST CONTAINMENT AS A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITY CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EVOLUTION OF RESEARCH ETHICS. DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS. SCHOLARLY BOOKS, PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, LEGAL SOURCES, THE WORLD WIDE WEB, AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION WERE EVALUATED IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT COST-CONTAINMENT-DRIVEN NON-THERAPEUTIC QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. THREE GENERATIONS IN THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS ARE IDENTIFIED: 1) HIPPOCRATES TO NUREMBERG CODE, 2) NUREMBERG TO BELMONT, AND 3) BELMONT TO PRESENT. SIMILAR ETHICAL LAPSES, WHICH PLACE THE INDIVIDUAL AT RISK WITHOUT DISCLOSURE FOR THE GOOD OF FUTURE PATIENTS, HAVE ARISEN RECURRENTLY IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY AND CONTINUE PRESENTLY WHEN NONTHERAPEUTIC QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FRAMED AS A HUMAN RESEARCH ACTIVITY WITH ESSENTIALLY NO ETHICAL OVERSIGHT. CONSEQUENTLY, FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS OF PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR EMPLOYER-INSTITUTIONS TO THEIR MUTUAL PATIENTS MAY BE AT ODDS, CREATING COMPLEX LAYERS OF CONFLICTED DECISION MAKING. NONETHELESS, PROFESSIONAL HIPPOCRATIC DUTY TO "THE PATIENT" MUST BE CONGRUENT WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL ETHOS OF LIMITED FUNDING "STEWARDSHIP" TO PRODUCE MEANINGFUL PATIENT CARE. MEDICINE'S INTEGRITY IS LEGALLY PROTECTED AND MANDATED UNDER THE STATE INTERESTS (PARENS PATRIA DOCTRINE) OF THE COMMON LAW. CONCLUSION: WHEN HOSPITALS (SOCIETY AND ITS HEALTH INSURANCE METHODS) FAIL TO RATION TRANSPARENTLY UNDER "COST-CONTAINMENT ETHICS," THEY THREATEN THE ETHICAL INTEGRITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.
934	PRESIDENT ERDOGAN AND THE AKP GOVERNMENT INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE RESTORATION PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FAILED COUP IN MID-JULY 2016. IN FACT, THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND VIOLENT REGIME TRANSFORMATION SINCE THIS TIME. I ASSERT THAT RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS PAVED THE WAY FOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF A 'PLEBISCITARY PRESIDENTIAL REGIME' THAT DEPENDS ON A PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF SUPREME POWER OF THE LEADER, AN EXTREMELY WEAK PARLIAMENT, AND ELECTIONS OF A PLEBISCITARY CHARACTER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PAPER AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE ROLE OF THE NEW STRATEGIC LEGALISM WHICH ALLOWS RULE OF LAW TO BE REPLACED BY A RULE BY LAW APPROACH, THE EXECUTIVE PREROGATIVE PRINCIPLE TO BE DOMINANT, AND THE LAW TO BE USED FOR DEMOBILIZATION, ALL PLAYING A HIGHLY CRITICAL ROLE IN THE SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRATIC OPPOSITION.
935	THE EU AND THE WESTERN BALKANS IN 2020 LAUNCHED A REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION INITIATIVE ENTITLED 'THE WESTERN BALKANS COMMON REGIONAL MARKET', AIMED AT ECONOMICALLY INTEGRATING THE WESTERN BALKANS BASED ON THE EU SINGLE MARKET RULES BY 2025. THE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION INITIATIVE HAS BEEN MET WITH CHALLENGES, AND THIS CONTRIBUTION PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF EU-LED INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITHIN THE WESTERN BALKANS BETWEEN 2014 AND 2021, ANALYSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES TO ENSURING THAT THE WESTERN BALKANS COMMON REGIONAL MARKET IS OPERATIONAL BY 2025. THE CONTRIBUTION CONCEPTUALISES THE MODE OF GOVERNANCE APPROACH USED BY THE EU IN ENGAGING WITH THE WESTERN BALKANS SINCE 2014 AND SUGGESTS THAT IT IS LARGELY BASED ON SOFT LAW. THE CONTRIBUTION FINDS THAT THE ACTION PLAN FOR ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL COMMON MARKET IS FLAWED, AS IT HAS NOT TAKEN ON BOARD THE HIGH LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND THE LACK OF RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE CONTRIBUTION PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE NATURE OF CORRUPTION TAKING PLACE IN THE WESTERN BALKANS AND ARGUES THAT CORRUPTION AND THE LACK OF THE RULE OF LAW COULD BE A MAJOR BARRIER FOR THE PROPERFUNCTION OF THE REGIONAL COMMON MARKET.
936	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, ENTREPRENEURIAL TYPES, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN UNBALANCED PANEL DATA OF 18 ASIAN COUNTRIES OVER 2006-2018 USING A 3SLS ESTIMATION METHOD. IT EXTENDS THE NEOCLASSICAL GROWTH MODEL WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAPITAL TYPES AS AN ENDOGENOUS VARIABLE TO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH FUNCTION. FINDINGS/ORIGINALITY: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT NEW BUSINESS DENSITY AND PRODUCTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT GDP PER CAPITA. ADDITIONALLY, A REVERSE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS REVEALED. INSTITUTION'S CONSTRUCTS, NAMELY CORRUPTION CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE CRUCIAL TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WHICH IN TURN STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RESULTS ALSO CONFIRM THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL, ACCUMULATING DOMESTIC INVESTMENT, ECONOMIC OPENNESS, AND CONTROLLING INFLATION IN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL OF THE ASIAN COUNTRIES.
937	WHILE UBER IS ABLE TO OPERATE LEGALLY IN A GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND CITIES, REGULATORY APPROVAL HAS PROVED TO BE ELUSIVE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. YET, IN A NUMBER OF REGIONS OR CITIES UBER DECIDED TO LAUNCH ITS SERVICES DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REGULATORY APPROVAL. THE FACT THAT UBER HAS DECIDED TO ENGAGE IN "SPONTANEOUS LIBERALISATION" HAS DRAWN CRITICISM FROM VARIOUS QUARTERS. BUT SHOULD UBER BE BLAMED FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR SHOULD THEY BE APPLAUDED FOR PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE LAW? WHETHER SPONTANEOUS LIBERALIZATION SHOULD BE APPLAUDED OR CRITICIZED DEPENDS. WHILE THERE IS GENERALLY NO JUSTIFICATION FOR IGNORING RULES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE SERVICES' USERS AND NONUSERS FROM THE RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT TO THE CARRYING OF PASSENGERS ON PUBLIC ROADS, THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF PUBLIC GOOD IN TESTING THE BOUNDARIES OF PUBLIC RESTRICTIONS OF COMPETITION. WHATEVER HAPPENS TO UBER'S EFFORTS TO CHALLENGE RULES IMPEDING ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SERVICES IN CERTAIN MARKETS, THE TAXI INDUSTRY HAS ALREADY CHANGED FOR THE BETTER AS MANY TAXI COMPANIES HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR OWN APPS, EITHER ALONE OR WITH OTHERS, AND HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF SERVICE. UBER WAS A NEEDED ELECTROSHOCK IN AN INDUSTRY WHOSE ACTORS HAD OFTEN BECOME COMPLACENT AND FAILED TO MEET USER EXPECTATIONS.
938	WHILE PRIVATE CORPORATIONS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY INFLUENTIAL IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES IS MISSING. ALTHOUGH INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS MAY GOVERN SOME ASPECTS OF, FOR INSTANCE, INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS AND THE SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES, THERE IS NO OVERARCHING STRUCTURE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF LARGE-SCALE PRIVATE PROJECTS. IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK, SPECIFIC RULES OF PRIVATE LAW ALLOW PROFIT-SEEKING COMPANIES TO EXPAND THEIR ACTIVITIES ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS, MOSTLY WITHOUT HAVING TO HEED SOCIAL CONCERNS (PISTOR, 2019). THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC INSOFAR AS MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES HAVE OBTAINED POWER TO SET THE RULES FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH STATES, ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS, FOR INSTANCE IN THE FORM OF TRANSNATIONAL INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. GIVEN THE FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE LEGAL SPHERE IN WHICH SUCH CONTRACTS ARE ELABORATED AND PERFORMED, THOSE WHO FACE THE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. THE CONTRACTS REMAIN IN 'WILD ZONES' OF GLOBALISATION (FRASER, 2014, P. 150), WHERE POWERFUL PRIVATE COMPANIES RULE.
939	IN 1987, AT THE 13TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE CCP, ZHAO ZIYANG PROPOSED TO SEPARATE THE PARTY AND THE STATE. LIKE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS AT REFORM, HOWEVER, THIS INITIATIVE WAS THWARTED AND IT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN SINCE THE CRACKDOWN IN 1989. THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THAT BLUEPRINT WITH A CONTRASTING AGENDA FOR REFORM: THE CENTRALIZATION OF POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL POWER UNDER XI JINPING. SINCE 2013, THAT REFORM HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY CONTEMPORARY ANTICORRUPTION CAMPAIGNS AND THE SYSTEMATIC RESTRICTION OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE LOGIC OF 'AUTHORITARIAN LEGALITY' AS APPLIED TO CHINA'S CONTEMPORARY REFORM AND ARGUES THAT, WITHOUT RELIABLE GRASSROOTS SUPPORT, TOP-DOWN SUPERVISORY REFORM WILL FAIL TO ACHIEVE ITS STATED AIMS, AND JUDICIAL REFORM MAKE NO SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT REINSTATING THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTY AND ADMINISTRATION IS THE ONLY WAY CHINESE LEGAL REFORM CAN MAKE GENUINE PROGRESS UNDER THE EXISTING REGIME.
940	ACROSS THE LAST 50 YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN HUGE EFFORTS TO CONSTRUCT MORE JUST AND ACCOUNTABLE INSTITUTIONS AT EVERY LEVEL FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS TO STATE BUREAUCRACIES, FROM TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND NGOS WITH GLOBAL REACH TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND LOCAL CHARITIES. THIS HAS BEEN DONE BOTH BY EXTENDING LAW AND OTHER FORMS OF REGULATION AT EVERY LEVEL FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TO THE LOCAL, AND BY INCREASING SECOND-ORDER REQUIREMENTS THAT HOLD INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR LIVING UP TO THE RELEVANT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YET INCREASES IN LEGISLATION, REGULATION AND SYSTEMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE NOT ENOUGH. THEY NEED THE SUPPORT OF TRUSTWORTHY AND EFFECTIVE CULTURES AND SUBCULTURES THAT ENABLE THOSE WHO INHABIT THEM TO EXPLORE, SHARE AND CONSIDER ETHICAL AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS TO THE TASKS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT STAKE AND WORKING OUT WHAT TO DO.
941	THIS PAPER DEFENDS HUMAN DIGNITY IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, BY CONFRONTING THE CRITICISM THAT HUMAN DIGNITY DOES NOT SERVE AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN CONTEMPORARY MORAL DISCOURSE AND THAT ITS FUNCTION CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY PERFORMED BY OTHER MORAL TERMS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THIS CRITICISM INVITES A DANGER OF MORAL REDUCTIONISM, WHICH IMPOVERISHES MORAL DISCOURSE. THE AUTHORITY OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY TO CORRECT WIDELY SHARED MORAL INTUITIONS, ROOTED IN EXPERIENCES OF GRAVE INJUSTICES AND WRONGS, IS QUESTIONED. SECONDLY, DIGNITY IS DEFENDED BY SHOWING WHAT IS NEEDED TO UPHOLD IT, BOTH IN THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT IS ARGUED, AND DEMONSTRATED THROUGH EXAMPLES, THAT HUMAN DIGNITY AS A UNIVERSAL VALUE ASCRIBED TO HUMAN BEINGS AND THE VIRTUE OF DIGNIFIED ACTION ARE INTIMATELY RELATED. THIS IS FLESHED OUT IN TERMS OF KANT'S ANALYSIS OF RESPECT IN THE PRACTICAL SENSE AND OF VIRTUE AS A COMMITMENT TO THE VALUE OF DIGNITY AS A CONSTITUTIVE END OF OUR MORAL ORDER. IT IS FURTHERMORE ARGUED THAT THEORETICAL ATTEMPTS TO GROUND RESPECT FOR DIGNITY IN HUMAN CAPACITIES LEAD TO A MORAL IMPASSE. IT IS NECESSARY TO ACT AS IF EVERY HUMAN BEING IS WORTHY OF RESPECT. THIS PRACTICAL APPROACH REQUIRES INSTITUTIONS AND SPECIFIED MORAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC ETHOS AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH GUARANTEES THE EQUAL STATUS OF HUMAN BEINGS. THIS PRACTICAL TASK REQUIRES THAT WE CONSISTENTLY TEASE OUT AND ACT ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN SEEK DEEPER JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EQUAL WORTH OF HUMANS, ARTICULATED IN THE TERM HUMAN DIGNITY.
942	THIS ARTICLE CARRIES OUT A PHILOSOPHICAL-LEGAL AND GENEALOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONTINUITY, IN THE CURRENT REGULATION OF THE RIGHT TO STRIKE IN SPAIN, OF AN AUTHORITARIAN HERITAGE FROM THE FRANCO DICTATORSHIP, BASED ON NATIONAL UNITY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC ORDER. THIS HERITAGE, WHICH DEVALUATES THE CHARACTER OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHT TO STRIKE AND THE VERY FUNCTIONING OF SPAIN ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW, IS EVIDENCED IN THE LEGAL PROVISION THAT REGULATES IT, ROYAL DECREE-LAW 17/1977, APPROVED DURING THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, AND IN A CRIMINAL LABOR LAW THAT HAS LIMITED ITS ESSENTIAL CONTENT.
943	PUBLIC RECOURSE TO VIGILANTE SELF-HELP HAS OFTEN BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO A LACK OF EFFECTIVE STATE INTERVENTION; LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE CHARACTER OF THIS INTERVENTION. USING THE TYLERIAN PROCEDURAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE, I ARGUE IN THIS ARTICLE THAT PERCEIVED PROCEDURAL INJUSTICE CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASED PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR VIOLENT SELF-HELP MECHANISMS SUCH AS VIGILANTE VIOLENCE. THE CURRENT STUDY TESTS THIS THEORETICAL ARGUMENT USING SURVEY DATA OF 374 RESIDENTS OF ACCRA, GHANA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AGE, EDUCATION, AND POLICE TRUSTWORTHINESS WERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF SUPPORT FOR VIGILANTE SELF- HELP. THE IMPACTS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS WERE FOUND TO BE EMBRACED WITHIN POLICE TRUSTWORTHINESS, BUT PERCEPTIONS OF POLICE EFFECTIVENESS AND EXPERIENCE OF POLICE CORRUPTION WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF VIGILANTE SUPPORT.
944	SOUTH AFRICA'S POLITICAL LIBERALISATION AND STRENGTHENING REGIONAL TICS HAVE ENGENDERED NEW PATTERNS OF IMMIGRATION AND URBANISATION, RESULTING IN SOUTH AFRICAN MIGRANTS AND NON-NATIONALS CONVERGING ON THE STREETS OF PREVIOUSLY 'FORBIDDEN' CITIES. CONFLICTS OVER SPACE, SERVICES AND LIVELIHOODS ARE EMERGING AS THESE GROUPS MEET AND COMPETE. TO SETTLE THESE DISPUTES, SOUTH AFRICAN CITIZENS AND POLITICIANS REGULARLY RELY ON NATIVIST DISCOURSES THAT MAKE ONE'S RIGHTS TO THE CITY CONTINGENT ON ONE'S NATIONAL ORIGINS. EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE FOREIGNERS ARE IN TURN ENCOURAGING AND LEGITIMISING NEW FORMS OF BIAS, ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRIMINATION AND ANTI-FOREIGNER POLICING. BOLSTERED BY OFFICIAL SANCTION, THESE ARE CREATING URBAN 'ZONES OF EXCEPTION', AREAS IN WHICH THE STATE AUTHORISES ITS AGENTS TO WORK OUTSIDE THE LAW. ALTHOUGH POPULAR AMONG SOUTH AFRICANS, THE EXTRA-LEGAL HARASSMENT, DETENTION AND DEPORTATION OF NON-NATIONALS HAS HELPED ENTRENCH NEW ECONOMICS OF CORRUPTION AND VIOLENCE THAT JEOPARDISE THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF ALL URBAN RESIDENTS. WHILE ROOTED IN THE DYNAMICS OF POST-APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA, THESE FINDINGS RESONATE WITH GLOBAL TRENDS IN WHICH QUESTS TO ASSERT SOVEREIGNTY THROUGH IMMIGRATION CONTROLS ARE RESULTING IN ACTIONS THAT UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMACY AND FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE LIBERAL STATES THAT UNDERTAKE THEM.
945	AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN HUNGARY, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE QUESTION WHETHER THE EUROPEAN UNION OUGHT TO PLAY A ROLE IN PROTECTING LIBERAL DEMOCRACY IN MEMBER STATES. FIRST, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE EU HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO, BOTH IN A BROAD NORMATIVE SENSE AND IN A NARROWER LEGAL SENSE (THOUGH THE LATTER IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DISPUTED). THE ARTICLE THEN ASKS WHETHER THE EU HAS THE CAPACITY TO ESTABLISH A SUPRANATIONAL MILITANT DEMOCRACY; HERE IT IS ARGUED THAT AT THE MOMENT BOTH APPROPRIATE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND PLAUSIBLE POLITICAL STRATEGIES ARE MISSING. TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A NEW DEMOCRACY WATCHDOG, ANALOGOUS TO, BUT MORE POWERFUL THAN, THE VENICE COMMISSION. FINALLY, IT IS ASKED WHETHER EU INTERVENTIONS WOULD PROVOKE A NATIONALIST BACKLASH. THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO DECIDE THIS QUESTION, BUT THE DANGER OF SUCH A BACKLASH PROBABLY TEND TO BE OVERESTIMATED.
946	WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF GROWING CONCERN FOR ANALYZING THE QUALITY OF YOUNG DEMOCRACIES, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE PARAGUAYAN CASE. A DEMOCRACY SOMETIMES NEGLECTED BY THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE. HOWEVER, PARAGUAY IS DRAWING ATTENTION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COLORADO'S PARTY DEFEAT ( IN OFFICE SINCE 1947) IN THE 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. A THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL THINKING ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY TOGETHER WITH AN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH HAVE BEEN DONE IN THIS ARTICLE. FIVE ESSENTIAL DIMENSIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION: POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES; RULE OF LAW; ACCOUNTABILITY; RESPONSIVENESS AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT PARAGUAY HAS A LOW QUALITY DEMOCRACY, FAR AWAY FROM THE REST OF LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THIS STATEMENT IS BACKED UP BY THREE DIFFERENT EXPLANATIONS THAT ARE, AT THE SAME TIME, INTERLINKED. THESE ARE THE FOLLOWING: SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, FEATURES OF ITS OWN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS (ABOVE ALL, THE WIDESPREAD CLIENTELISM) AND, FINALLY, POLITICAL PARTIES' INTERESTS AND STRATEGIES.
947	THIS EXPLORATORY RESEARCH AIMS TO PROPOSE A CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION OF GOVERNANCE AND TO SPECULATE ON THE STATE OF GOVERNANCE IN LATIN AMERICA. POLITICAL INSTABILITY, CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT TRUST, THE RULE OF LAW, AND NASCENT DEMOCRACY COMPLICATE THE DEFINITION AND PRACTICE OF GOVERNANCE IN THE REGION. NEVERTHELESS, THIS PAPERS OFFERED A WORKING DEFINITION. SUCH DEFINITION APPLIES VARIOUSLY ACROSS COUNTRIES-- SOME CASES SHOW DISHEARTENING RESULTS, OTHERS SEEM PROMISING. COMMON TO ALL COUNTRIES IS THAT GOVERNANCE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY COLLABORATIVE AND INNOVATIVE IN DESIGNING DEMOCRATICALLY RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT STILL DEPENDS ON HIGHLY HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURES AND IT IS RULE DRIVEN.
948	GIVEN THE CRITICAL ROLE PLAYED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, THE REFORM OF ITS POWERS AND UNDERLYING FRAMEWORK IS FUNDAMENTAL IN ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER ANALYSES TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF REFORMS INTRODUCED IN BRAZIL, CHILE AND MEXICO THAT AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE (THE "PPO") PERFORMS ITS DAILY DUTIES: 1) CRIMINAL PROCEDURE; AND 2) INSTITUTIONAL LOCATION. THIS PAPER TAKES A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO EVALUATE EFFORTS CARRIED OUT BY POLITICIANS TO MODIFY KEY ASPECTS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AS WELL AS OVERCOME KEY CHALLENGES. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON RECENTLY ENACTED CHANGES TO THE CONSTITUTION, ORGANIC LAWS, CRIMINAL CODES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURES.
949	THIS PAPER EXPLORES HONG KONG COURTS' RECOURSE TO FOREIGN AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL MATERIALS IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING HONG KONG, THE BASIC LAW OF HONG KONG AND THE HONG KONG BILL OF RIGHTS ORDINANCE, BOTH GENERALLY AND IN TWO SPECIFIC CASES CONCERNING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR MALE/MALE SEXUAL ACTIVITY. IT DISCUSSES HOW HONG KONG COURTS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF POLITICAL REALITIES CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY FOREIGN COURTS IN MATTERS CONCERNING HONG KONG. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPARATIVISM AS HAS BEEN PRACTISED IN HONG KONG, THIS PAPER ARGUES, MERELY SERVES TO ALLOW FOR AND PERPETUATE UNPREDICTABLE JUDICIAL REASONING AND THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF HONG KONG'S COLONIAL PAST, AND IS IN NEED OF A CONSISTENT AND REASONED APPROACH FOR ITS LEGITIMATE APPLICATION AND, ULTIMATELY, THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, INCLUDING SEXUAL MINORITY RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG.
950	FOREIGN- RELATED AFFAIRS ARE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CONSIDERED FROM A DOMESTIC PERSPECTIVE, AND THEIR GOVERNANCE MODELS VARY OVER TIME. WAR HAS LONG BEEN A DECISIVE APPROACH TO HANDLING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. WITH THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS REQUIRING PEACEFUL RESOLUTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES AND GENERAL BANNING USE OF FORCE OR THREAT OF FORCE TO ADDRESS INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN PLACED ON A TRACK OF LEGAL GOVERNANCE. GOVERNANCE OF FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS HAS TO BE FORMALIZED, ALTHOUGH THE ASSOCIATED LEGAL GOVERNANCE MODEL STILL HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER MODELS, AND THE DOMESTIC CONTEXT PLAYS A GREAT ROLE IN THIS. LEGAL GOVERNANCE CAN ADOPT AN APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL LAW, DOMESTIC LAW, AND POLICY COORDINATION. THE LEGAL GOVERNANCE OF CHINA'S FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS CAN BE REGARDED AS THE RULE OF LAW APPLIED TO FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS. TO EXERCISE FOREIGN-RELATED LAWS, CHINA SHOULD ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS IN A COORDINATED MANNER, APPROPRIATELY EXERCISING EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION AND JURISDICTION, SAFEGUARDING NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND DEVELOPMENT INTERESTS, AS WELL AS COMMON VALUES OF HUMANITY, AND BUILDING A HUMAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE.
951	BACKGROUND: SINCE WINTER 2020, EXCESS DEATHS DUE TO COVID-19 HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN EASTERN EUROPE THAN MOST OF WESTERN EUROPE, PARTLY BECAUSE REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT WAS POOR.METHODS: THIS PAPER ANALYSED DATA FROM 50 COUNTRIES IN THE WHO EUROPEAN REGION, IN ADDITION TO DATA FROM USA AND CANADA. EXCESS MMORTALITY AND VACCINATION DATA WERE RETRIEVED FROM "OUR WORLD IN DATA" AND REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION WAS ASSESSED USING STANDARD METHODS. MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MORTALITY AND EACH COVARIATE.RESULTS: EXCESS MORTALITY INCREASED BY 4.1 PER 100 000 (P = 0.038) FOR EVERY PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN VACCINATION RATE AND WITH 6/100 000 (P=0.011) FOR EVERY DECREASED UNIT IN THE REGULATORY IMPLEMENTATION SCORE A COUNTRY ACHIEVED IN THE RULE OF LAW INDEX. CONCLUSION: DEGREE OF REGULATION ENFORCEMENT, LIKELY INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE ENFORCEMENT, MAY BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CONTROLLING COVID-19'S DELETERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS.
952	PPPS HAVE BECOME A POPULAR WAY TO SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND THE WORLD. HOWEVER, COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE FAILED TO ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT OVER THE PAST YEARS. RISK ALLOCATION AND GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT (E.G., THE EXTENT OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL STABILITY, THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICES, THE ABILITY OF REGULATIONS, ABIDING THE LAW, AND THE EXTENT OF CORRUPTION) MAY BE IMPORTANT FACTORS. TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES, USING ABOUT 4560 PPP PROJECTS IN 138 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM 2002 TO 2015, THIS PAPER APPLIES THE TOBIT REGRESSION MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSUMED BY PRIVATE PARTNERS ON PRIVATE INVESTMENT. RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRIVATE PARTNERS ASSUME THAT LESS RISK CAN ATTRACT MORE PRIVATE INVESTMENT, AND THAT A HIGHER LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, AND RULE OF LAW) REDUCES THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF RISK ASSUMED BY PRIVATE PARTNERS ON PRIVATE INVESTMENTS.

953	MANY COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA HAVE TURNED TOWARDS SOCIALIST GOVERNMENTS. THESE PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN MANY CASES, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO THE CASTRO-CHAVISTA MOVEMENT. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES TWO GENERALLY ACCEPTED IDEAS: I) THAT THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A << BOLIVARIAN CONSTITUTION >> OR << CASTRO-CHAVISTA CONSTITUTION >> AND, II) THAT A NEW CONSTITUTION IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A CASTRO-CHAVISTA GOVERNMENT. ON THE CONTRARY, WE MAINTAIN THAT TALKING ABOUT A << CASTRO-CHAVISTA CONSTITUTION >> IS AN OXYMORON. THERE IS NO CONSTITUTION WHEN WHAT IS SOUGHT IS PRECISELY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE, A CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IS NOT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, BUT ONLY IF SEEN FROM A SUPERFICIAL AND INSTRUMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. THE ESSAY IS BASED ON THE STUDY OF THE PERUVIAN CASE, WHICH DELVES INTO CURRENT NEWS TO THE POINT OF RISKING ITS ACADEMIC OR << SCIENTIFIC >> VALUE, BUT AS A NECESSARY RESOURCE TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTIONAL/POLITICAL PROCESS EXPERIENCED IN PERU, BEYOND THE THEORY.
954	AB V MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT CENTRED ON THE APPLICATION OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD PRINCIPLE TO SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD AND THE USE OF DONOR GAMETES. GIVEN THE SENSITIVE AND EMOTIONAL NATURE OF THE SUBJECT, AB WAS A LITMUS TEST FOR SOUTH AFRICA'S COURTS' COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EVIDENCE SUBMITTED BY BOTH SIDES IN AB AND SHOWS THAT THE CONTENT OF THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD WAS CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS FROM THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE COURT - EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CONTRARY TO TRADITIONAL NOTIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC RELATEDNESS. WHILE THE PRETORIA HIGH COURT RELIED ON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE IT, THE MAJORITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DISREGARDED THE EVIDENCE AND RATHER RELIED ON TRADITIONAL NOTIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC RELATEDNESS. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, WHILE THE PRETORIA HIGH COURT PASSED THE LITMUS TEST, THE MAJORITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT FAILED SPECTACULARLY.
955	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE LOCKDOWN IMPOSED IN SUDAN DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THE LIVELIHOOD OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE A DIGNIFIED LIFE. IT EXPLORES HOW EMERGENCY MEASURES WERE AIMED AT CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE MEASURES HAVE SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THE ENJOYMENT OF CORE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A WEAK LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK OF SOCIAL PROTECTION. IT CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT SUDAN'S TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY AND EXERCISES LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS THAT ARE DE FACTO ILLEGITIMATE, AS THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COURTS AND BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SUSPENSION OF CONSTITUTIONAL ORGANS AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. THIS INCOMPLETE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS CONCERNING FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE AND HAS PREVENTED SCRUTINY OF COVID-19 EMERGENCY MEASURES, PARTICULARLY THOSE AFFECTING THE BASIC RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE GROUPS.
956	THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, LED BY THE UNITED NATIONS, CREATED KOSOVO'S NEW POST-WAR INSTITUTIONS AND CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE THEM, EVEN AFTER KOSOVO DECLARED INDEPENDENCE IN 2008. YET DESPITE ENORMOUS INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT AND THE CLEAR INTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, KOSOVO'S GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS REMAIN WEAK, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRESENT PAPER APPLIES THE GARBAGE CAN MODEL OF GOVERNANCE TO EXPLAIN THE CREATION OF INSTITUTIONS IN KOSOVO AND IDENTIFY THE DESIGN FLAWS THAT HAVE LED TO WEAK INSTITUTIONS. FOR ITS CASE STUDIES, IT FOCUSES ON THE PRIVATISATION OF SOCIALLY OWNED PROPERTY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTRACT LAW. A COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT WITH DIFFERENT POLICY PREFERENCES AND THE DRIVE OF INTERNATIONAL ACTORS TO PROMOTE THEIR NATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO KOSOVO'S PROBLEMS IN A DECONTEXTUALISED MANNER HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CREATION OF WEAK INSTITUTIONS THAT CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE KOSOVO'S DEVELOPMENT TO DATE.
957	THE ARTICLE, WHICH IS BASED ON A LECTURE DELIVERED IN LONDON IN SEPTEMBER 2015, ADDRESSES THE POSSIBILITIES FOR ADJUDICATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES BEFORE INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS, FINDING THEM TO BE MORE FAVOURABLE TODAY THAN A FEW YEARS AGO. IT ARGUES FOR A ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS IN THE DETERMINATION OF FACTUAL AND SCIENTIFIC MATTERS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, ASSESSING THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS OF A MORE GENERAL JURISDICTION, SUCH AS ITLOS AND THE ICJ.
958	WHEN CONFRONTING DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN ITS MEMBER STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CANNOT RELY ON MATERIAL SANCTIONS. THERE ARE FORMIDABLE OBSTACLES TO USING THE ONE POLITICAL SAFEGUARD THAT ENTAILS MATERIAL SANCTIONS, NAMELY ARTICLE 7 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU). MOREOVER, THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EU'S PRE-ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY SUGGESTS THAT EVEN A CREDIBLE THREAT OF MATERIAL SANCTIONS IS LEAST EFFECTIVE THE MORE SEVERE THE BREACHES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, EU INTERVENTIONS WITHOUT MATERIAL LEVERAGE ARE NOT NECESSARILY DOOMED, AS THE CASE OF ROMANIA IN 2012 SHOWS. UNDER FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS THE EU CAN THUS ELICIT GOVERNMENTS TO REPEAL ILLIBERAL PRACTICES BY RELYING PRIMARILY ON SOCIAL PRESSURE AND PERSUASION. THIS CONTRIBUTION ASSESSES TO WHAT EXTENT NOVEL INSTRUMENTS THAT EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEVELOPED TO CONFRONT DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE SOCIAL INFLUENCE. IT ARGUES THAT THE COMMISSION'S RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK HAS POTENTIAL BECAUSE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA OF FORMALIZATION, PUBLICITY AND IMPARTIALITY. YET, TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF INFLUENCE, IT NEEDS TO BE APPLIED MORE CONSISTENTLY AND SHOULD BE EMBEDDED IN A PROCESS OF REGULAR MONITORING THROUGH A DEMOCRACY SCOREBOARD COVERING ALL MEMBER STATES.
959	IN ORDER TO INFER WHETHER THE VENEZUELAN REALITY DURING THE CHAVEZ-MADURISTA PERIOD MEETS THE PARAMETERS OF LEGITIMACY AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNABILITY, IN A DEMOSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE OF THE SAME VENEZUELANS, THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE COVERED: A) DESCRIPTION OF THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMACY, AS WELL AS THOSE OF MATERIAL, FORMAL, ORIGIN AND FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY; B) DISTINCTION OF CITIZEN SATISFACTION INDEXES, IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, DIVISION OF POWERS, ECONOMY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, BASED ON THE QUANTITATIVE TOOLS OFFERED BY LATINOBAROMETRO.ORG, CONTRASTING THE RESULTS WITH QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS DEVELOPED BY FREEDOM HOUSE, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE OAS, THE IACHR, THE UPLA AND SPECIALIZED ACADEMICS' PERCEPTIONS; C) IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF THE STATISTICAL FALLS FOUND, A LIST OF HISTORICAL FACTS THAT MATCH TEMPORARILY WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE INSTRUMENT WAS MADE, FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT, PRESUMABLY, WOULD EXPLAIN THE OUTCOMES' REASON. AT THE END OF THE PROCESS, THE RESULTS POINT OUT THAT, IN THE SPECIFIC CASE ANALYZED AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE EXPLAINED DEMOSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, THE EXISTENCE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS FOR THE CHAVEZ-MADURISTA GOVERNMENT AS LEGITIMATE AND MATERIALLY DEMOCRATIC IS NOT UPDATED, CONCLUSION WHICH IS OBTAINED ABDUCTIVELY.
960	THE YEAR 2016 SEEMED TO MARK A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN CHINA'S NON-PROFIT SECTOR AS THE GOVERNMENT PASSED SEVERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE CHARITY LAW. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THIS DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF LEGAL REGIMES GOVERNING NGOS, AND CONSIDERS THE CONTEXTS OF THESE RECENT LEGAL CHANGES. BY DOING SO, THIS PAPER AIMS TO INFER THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) IN CHINA. COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THOSE INTRODUCED BY XI JINPING'S ADMINISTRATION SUGGEST THE PARTY-STATE'S HEIGHTENED WILLINGNESS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUMERICAL GROWTH AND DIVERSIFICATION OF NGOS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHINESE SOCIETY. HOWEVER, THE NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS ALSO INDICATE THE GOVERNMENT'S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT A MORE EXPLICIT DIVIDE-AND-RULE APPROACH TO NGOS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE GOVERNMENT AIMS TO ACTIVELY INCORPORATE THOSE NGOS THAT IT CONSIDERS USEFUL AND INNOCUOUS INTO AN INCREASINGLY INSTITUTIONALIZED SYSTEM OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER, THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO APPLY THE POLICY OF OUTRIGHT REJECTION AND REPRESSION TO THOSE IT IDENTIFIES AS THREATENING THE PARTY-STATE'S AUTHORITY.
961	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES A NEW STAGE OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BUDAPEST AND WARSAW WITH BRUSSELS, RELATED TO THE OBSERVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MECHANISM OF BUDGET ALLOCATION MADE DEPENDENT ON THE FULFILMENT OF THIS CONDITION. THE HISTORY OF THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND RECENT EVENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION TURNED OUT TO BE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX PROCESS THAN THE PARTICIPANTS HAD INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. THUS, A CLEAR CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PROCESS IS THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON THE ISSUE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE NEW REGULATION 2020/2092 AGAINST HUNGARY AND POLAND, AS WELL AS THE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT VOICES ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEW REFORMS AND THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF UNANIMITY IN THE ADOPTION OF TAX AND OTHER INITIATIVES IN THE EU. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE SOME WARMING OF RELATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MIGRATION CRISIS ON THE POLISH-BELARUSIAN BORDER IN 2021 AND THE EVENTS IN UKRAINE, THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE TWO CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CHOSEN CONSERVATIVE COURSES AND BRUSSELS WILL CONTINUE IN THE COMING YEARS.
962	AUTOCRATIC REGIMES FORM AN INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT DIFFERS SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THOSE IN DEMOCRATIC CAPITALIST SOCIETIES. IN GENERAL, DEMOCRACY GUARANTEES EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. ACCORDING TO HAYEK, THE RULE OF LAW PROTECTS PROPERTY RIGHTS RATHER THAN PROFITS OF ESTABLISHED FIRMS. INNOVATIVE OUTSIDERS CAN THEREBY CHALLENGE INCUMBENTS, WHICH IS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR CREATIVE DESTRUCTION. IN AUTOCRATIC REGIMES, BY CONTRAST, POLITICAL POWER IS INTERLACED WITH THE COMMAND OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES. ENTREPRENEURSHIP FACES POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS DEFINED BY ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF POLITICAL POWERHOLDERS WHO ARE TYPICALLY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ALSO ENGAGED IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. THE PAPER ANALYZES HOW AUTOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUBORDINATE THE ECONOMY IN ORDER TO CREATE RENTS AND MAINTAIN POWER. THE (NEO-) WEBERIAN CONCEPTION OF NEO-PATRIMONIALISM IS TRANSFERRED AND USED AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL TO DESCRIBE THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MARKET ACTIVITIES. THE PAPER PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION ECONOMIES AND DEMONSTRATES THE INSTITUTIONAL LOCK-IN EFFECT THAT MAKES THE MARKET ECONOMY DEPENDENT ON POLITICAL POWER. THE DELIBERATE COEXISTENCE OF LEGAL NORMS AND ARBITRARINESS IN NEO-PATRIMONIAL REGIMES INSTITUTIONALIZES UNCERTAINTY IN PARTICULAR. A TYPOLOGY OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO INSTITUTIONS OF THE NEO-PATRIMONIAL ORDER IS DISCUSSED. MOST OF THEM WILL IMPEDE ECONOMIC DYNAMISM.
963	GIVEN THE FORESEEABLE PERVASIVENESS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IN MODERN SOCIETIES, IT IS LEGITIMATE AND NECESSARY TO ASK THE QUESTION HOW THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY MUST BE SHAPED TO SUPPORT THE MAINTENANCE AND STRENGTHENING OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER FIRST DESCRIBES THE FOUR CORE ELEMENTS OF TODAY'S DIGITAL POWER CONCENTRATION, WHICH NEED TO BE SEEN IN CUMULATION AND WHICH, SEEN TOGETHER, ARE BOTH A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY AND TO FUNCTIONING MARKETS. IT THEN RECALLS THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LAWLESS INTERNET AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND THE LAW AS IT HAS DEVELOPED IN THE INTERNET ECONOMY AND THE EXPERIENCE WITH GDPR BEFORE IT MOVES ON TO THE KEY QUESTION FOR AI IN DEMOCRACY, NAMELY WHICH OF THE CHALLENGES OF AI CAN BE SAFELY AND WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE LEFT TO ETHICS, AND WHICH CHALLENGES OF AI NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY RULES WHICH ARE ENFORCEABLE AND ENCOMPASS THE LEGITIMACY OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESS, THUS LAWS. THE PAPER CLOSES WITH A CALL FOR A NEW CULTURE OF INCORPORATING THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS BY DESIGN IN AI AND A THREE-LEVEL TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AI AS A PRACTICAL WAY FORWARD FOR THIS PURPOSE. THIS ARTICLE IS PART OF A THEME ISSUE 'GOVERNING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES'.
964	THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) FLOWING INTO EMERGING NATIONS HAS ATTRACTED WORLDWIDE ATTENTION. THESE ECONOMIES ARE AT A SAME STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT WITH SIMILAR SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS, BUT THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT CAN ACT AS A DIFFERENTIATOR IN AFFECTING FDI LOCATION WITHIN THESE EMERGING ECONOMIES. SO, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS IN INFLUENCING THEIR INWARD FDI BY EMPLOYING BROAD-BASED INDICATORS OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE ARTICLE EMPLOYS PANEL DATA REGRESSION (FIXED EFFECTS) TO TEST THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS AND OTHER VARIABLES ON FDI INFLOWS AND STOCK OF 23 EMERGING ECONOMIES FROM 2006 TO 2015. THREE INDICES HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED FOR THIS PURPOSE, USING THE METHODOLOGY OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITE INDEX, FROM 24 INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES. ALL THE THREE INDICES, REPRESENTING THREE INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS TURNED SIGNIFICANT: 'RULE OF LAW' (NEGATIVE COEFFICIENT), 'REGULATORY EFFICIENCY' (POSITIVE COEFFICIENT) AND 'NORMATIVE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT' (NEGATIVE COEFFICIENT). THIS IMPLIES THAT ONE OF THE MAIN MOTIVATIONS FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS TO MAKE INVESTMENT IN EMERGING ECONOMIES IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR WEAK LAWS, NORMS AND VALUES. BUT THEY ALSO SEEK A BASIC ENABLING ENVIRONMENT WITH MINIMUM BURDENS AS FAR AS THE EFFICIENCY OF REGULATIONS IS CONCERNED.
965	INTRODUCTION. TRENDS OF EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE COMBINED WITH THE INNOVATION, BUILDING SCIENCE-INTENSIVE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL IN UKRAINE AND THE FLOURISHING OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ONE OF THE FACTORS OF EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DYNAMICS IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF ECONOMIC REGULATION, THE DEVELOPMENT A HOLISTIC STRATEGY FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIONS IN PRODUCTION. PROBLEM STATEMENT. AN URGENT SCIENTIFIC TASK IS TO ASSESS THE SCIENTIFIC ORIENTATION OF THE DEVELOPMENTS OF ECONOMISTS AND LAWYERS AND FILL THEM WITH NEW CONTENT OF MODERN REALITIES BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY. PURPOSE. THEORETICAL RETHINKING OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN MODERN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROMOTION OF INNOVATIONS. MATERIALS AND METHODS. ANALYTICAL, HISTORICAL, AND EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS METHODS FOR THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ANALYSIS, THE EMPIRICAL METHOD. RESULTS. ECONOMIC AND LEGAL ANALYSIS AND RETHINKING AND STRENGTHENING OF SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS OFF SCHUMPETER AND OTHER IN THE CATEGORY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, "CREATIVE DESTRUCTION" AND THE DRIVING FORCE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ECONOMIC GROWTH SUPPORTED BY A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF IRELAND'S ECONOMIC RISE IN 1987 -2006, PROVED THEIR ACCEPTABILITY FOR MODERN IMPLEMENTATION TO DOMESTIC ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND LEGAL POLICY. AS A RESULT OF GENERALIZATION IS THE ORIGINAL SCIENTIFIC VECTORS OF OPTIMAL REGULATION OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY BY ESTABLISHING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN URGENT NEED TO CREATE A POSITIVE IMPETUS TO ECONOMIC PROGRESS. CONCLUSIONS. OPTIMAL REGULATION OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS A LEVER TO PROMOTING ECONOMIC PROGRESS, INCREASING NATIONAL PROSPERITY, AND COMBATING POVERTY. FACTORS FOR ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY ARE THE PROTECTION OF THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE INTRODUCTION OF INNOVATIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY.
966	ALMOST ALL CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONS ARE ENTRENCHED, IN OTHER WORDS, HARDER TO AMEND THAN ORDINARY LAWS. "ENTRENCHMENT CLAUSES" FURTHER RAISE THESE HURDLES. THEY MAKE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN PARTS OF A CONSTITUTION OR AMENDMENTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES EITHER MORE DIFFICULT THAN "NORMAL" AMENDMENTS OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE. SUCH PROVISIONS ARE COMMON AROUND THE WORLD AND IN ALL TYPES OF POLITICAL SYSTEMS. NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL FROM A NORMATIVE POINT OF VIEW SINCE THEY MAY BE SEEN EITHER AS ADEQUATE MEANS FOR PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW OR AS ILLEGITIMATE RESTRICTIONS ON DEMOCRATIC SOVEREIGNTY. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE CODIFICATION OF ENTRENCHMENT CLAUSES IN CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONS. THE STUDY ANALYZES 210 NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS ADOPTED FROM 1975 UNTIL 2015. IT FOCUSES ON FACTORS DESCRIBING HISTORICAL LEGACIES, THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT OF CONSTITUTION-MAKING, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. AS WILL BE SHOWN, THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY HAS ALMOST NO SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION FOR OR AGAINST ENTRENCHMENT CLAUSES. INSTEAD, HISTORICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES AND CONTINGENT PROCEDURAL DECISIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS PREDETERMINE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CHOICE TO A LARGE EXTENT.
967	IN RECENT YEARS MEXICO HAS EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN DRUG-RELATED VIOLENCE AS THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO ERADICATE ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ELEMENTS BEHIND THE DRUG TRADE. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS MEXICO HAS PASSED MAJOR NEW CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS, AS WELL AS TO THE MILITARY AND POLICE. IN JUNE 2008, THE CONSTITUTION WAS AMENDED TO MOVE THE COUNTRY'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CLOSER TO THE ACCUSATORY (ADVERSARIAL AND ORAL) MODEL MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH COMMON LAW SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE UNITED STATES. MEXICAN OFFICIALS HOPE THAT BY MAKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE A MORE TRANSPARENT, PARTICIPATORY EXPERIENCE THE SYSTEM WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE EFFECTS OF THE DRUG WAR. HOWEVER, JUDICIAL REFORM IS FAR FROM SIMPLE EVEN UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND PRESENTS AN ESPECIALLY DAUNTING CHALLENGE WHEN UNDERTAKEN WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE. WHILE MEXICO HOPES THESE CHANGES WILL HELP ADDRESS THE BROADER EFFECTS OF CARTEL VIOLENCE ON SOCIETY, OBSERVERS OF THE PROCESS FEAR THAT THE REFORMS WILL SUFFER FROM THE TRADITIONAL OBSTACLES PRESENTED BY THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE IN TRANSITIONING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CORRUPTION, LACK OF REAL INDEPENDENCE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACTORS AND LIMITED EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE 2008 REFORMS WILL STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE AND HELP PROPEL THE COUNTRY TOWARDS SECURITY, STABILITY AND A STRONGER RULE OF LAW.
968	SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT, THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION HAS SUFFERED NUMEROUS BLOWS. TODAY, HOWEVER, IT IS GOING THROUGH A PERFECT STORM: FROM A PARALYSIS IN ITS LAWMAKING FUNCTION TO THE DEMISE OF THE APPELLATE BODY. POWERFUL ECONOMIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE MOVING AWAY FROM MULTILATERALISM, IN DIFFERENT WAYS, IN ORDER TO SHAPE NOVEL APPROACHES. NON-TRANSPARENT PRACTICES LIKE INFORMAL TRADE INSTRUMENTS, GEOECONOMICS, AND THE DOMESTICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES ARE APPEARING AS NEW TOOLS OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE PRACTICES AND APPROACHES FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE? THE COMMON THREAD IN ALL THESE FACTORS IS THE RELATIVE DECLINE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES AND CRITICALLY ASSESSES THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION IN ORDER TO REMEDY AND STRENGTHEN THE MULTILATERAL RULES-BASED TRADE ORDER.
969	THE LAW ON TAX ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTS A SYSTEMIC LEGAL ACT FOR THE WHOLE TAX SYSTEM OF MONTENEGRO AND IT CONTAINS THE DEFINITIONS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TAX NOTIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THIS LAW HAS THE SUBSIDIARY APPLICATION REGARDING ALL OTHER SPECIAL TAX LAWS, IN MANY OCCASIONS WHEN THERE IS A NEED TO DEFINE A CERTAIN IMPORTANT NOTION, THEY EXPLICITLY REFER TO A PROVISION OF LAW ON TAX ADMINISTRATION. ONE OF THESE CONCEPTS, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO ANT-EVASION LEGISLATION, REPRESENT THE PROVISIONS ON RELATED PERSONS. NAMELY, THE DETERMINATION OF THE NOTION OF RELATED PERSONS REPRESENTS A CERTAIN FORM OF PRELIMINARY QUESTION IN THE PROCESS OF APPLICATION OF LEGAL PROVISIONS WITH THE GOAL TO PREVENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAX ABUSE. BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECIFIC GOAL, WHICH IS ACHIEVED BY THE IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO TAXPAYERS, THEY MUST BE CAREFULLY DEFINED. THE PROBLEM REGARDING THE PROVISIONS ON RELATED PERSONS FROM THE LAW ON TAX ADMINISTRATION IS THE INADEQUATE DETERMINATION OF THIS COMPLEX LEGAL NOTION, WHAT IS PRODUCING MANY PROBLEMS IN THEIR APPLICATION IN PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE REPRESENTS THE ANALYSIS OF SUBJECT PROVISIONS ON RELATED PERSONS REGARDING THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF MONTENEGRO. IN THAT REGARD, IT WILL BE SUGGESTED THAT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN PROVISIONS ON RELATED PERSONS ARE NOT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF PROPORTIONALITY, RULE OF LAW AND EQUALITY/NONDISCRIMINATION.
970	THE VICTORY OF WESTERN LIBERAL STATES ENDING THE COLD WAR INSPIRED THE HOPE THAT INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COULD BE GUIDED BY THE IDEALS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE EARLY 1990S, A GROUP OF THINKERS DEVELOPED THE POLITICAL PROJECT OF COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF AN EXPANSION OF DEMOCRACY, BOTH WITHIN STATES AND AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL. WHILE SOME SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATIZATION WITHIN STATES, MUCH LESS HAS BEEN ATTAINED IN DEMOCRATIZING THE GLOBAL SYSTEM. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW ARTICLE IS TWOFOLD - ON THE ONE HAND, TO REASSERT THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF COSMOPOLITAN DEMOCRACY; ON THE OTHER, TO ADDRESS THE CRITICISMS COMING FROM REALIST, MARXIST, COMMUNITARIAN AND MULTICULTURAL PERSPECTIVES.
971	THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL OF AMERICAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DICTATES THAT THE RULE OF LAW SERVES AS THE INTELLECTUAL AND PRACTICAL FOUNDATION OF THE FIELD. ONE WAY TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL IS TO EXAMINE HOW THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WORKS TO SHAPE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN ITS OWN IMAGE. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A THOROUGH EXAMINATION FOR HOW THE COURT UNDER CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED LAWS AFFECTING GAY MARRIAGE, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, ABORTION RIGHTS, GUN OWNERSHIP, AND HEALTH CARE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY NARROWED CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS CONCERNING VOTING RIGHTS, CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS, AND EMPLOYER MANDATED CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE. THESE CONTRASTING CONSTITUTIONAL VIEWPOINTS NOT ONLY REPRESENT A TRANSFORMATIVE ERA IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT BUT ALSO IN HOW PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES IMPLEMENT THE COURT'S DECISIONS.
972	A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER ASSESSES FIVE COMMONLY USED MEASURES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THEIR RELATIVE ABILITY TO PREDICT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY RISK GUIDE RISK OF EXPROPRIATION AND WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS RULE OF LAW MEASURES, AS WELL AS PROPERTY RIGHTS INDICES FROM THE FRASER INSTITUTE AND HERITAGE FOUNDATION, ARE ALL POSITIVELY AND ROBUSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GDP PER CAPITA. POLITY IV'S EXECUTIVE CONSTRAINTS MEASURE HAS A STATISTICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY WEAKER IMPACT. THIS PAPER ALSO ADDRESSES THE METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH MEASURE TO GUIDE RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR EMPIRICAL STUDIES.
973	BACKGROUND: MEDICAL DISPUTES ARE COMMON IN HOSPITALS AND A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE OPERATIONS OF MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE LOOKED INTO THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDICAL DISPUTES AND HOSPITAL LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOSPITAL LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS AND MEDICAL DISPUTES, AND IT ALSO AIMED TO DEVELOP A NOMOGRAM TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MEDICAL DISPUTES. METHODS: BETWEEN JULY AND SEPTEMBER 2021, 2,716 ADMINISTRATORS FROM 130 HOSPITALS WERE ENROLLED FOR ANALYSIS. THE STUDY COLLECTED SEVENTEEN VARIABLES FOR EXAMINATION. TO ESTABLISH A NOMOGRAM, ADMINISTRATORS WERE RANDOMLY SPLIT INTO A TRAINING GROUP (N = 1,358) AND A VALIDATION GROUP (N = 1,358) WITH A 50:50 RATIO. THE NOMOGRAM WAS DEVELOPED USING DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRAINING GROUP, AND IT WAS VALIDATED IN THE VALIDATION GROUP. THE NOMOGRAM CONTAINED SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES THAT WERE LINKED TO MEDICAL DISPUTES AND WERE IDENTIFIED BY MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS. THE NOMOGRAM'S PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE WAS ASSESSED UTILIZING DISCRIMINATIVE AND CALIBRATING ABILITY. A WEB CALCULATOR WAS DEVELOPED TO BE CONDUCIVE TO MODEL UTILITY. RESULTS: MEDICAL DISPUTES WERE OBSERVED IN 41.53% (1,128/2,716) OF PARTICIPANTS. FIVE CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING MALE GENDER, HIGHER PROFESSIONAL RANKS, LONGER LENGTH OF SERVICE, WORSE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOSPITAL CHARTERS, AND WORSE CONSTRUCTION STATUS OF HOSPITAL RULE OF LAW, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH MORE MEDICAL DISPUTES BASED ON THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THESE VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED IN THE NOMOGRAM DEVELOPMENT. THE AUROC WAS 0.67 [95% CONFIDENT INTERVAL (CI): 0.64-0.70] IN THE TRAINING GROUP AND 0.68 (95% CI: 0.66-0.71) IN THE VALIDATION GROUP. THE CORRESPONDING CALIBRATION SLOPES WERE 1.00 AND 1.05, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTERCEPTS WERE 0.00 AND -0.06, RESPECTIVELY. THREE RISK GROUPS WERE CREATED AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS: THOSE IN THE HIGH-RISK GROUP EXPERIENCED MEDICAL DISPUTES 2.83 TIMES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN THOSE IN THE LOW-RISK GROUP (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: MEDICAL DISPUTE IS PREVAILING AMONG HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS, AND IT CAN BE REDUCED BY THE EFFECTIVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF HOSPITAL RULE OF LAW. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL NOMOGRAM TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MEDICAL DISPUTES SPECIFICALLY AMONG ADMINISTRATORS IN TERTIARY HOSPITALS, AND A WEB CALCULATOR CAN BE AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://YMGARDEN.SHINYAPPS.IO/PREDICTIONOFMEDICALDISPUTES/.
974	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMATIC ISSUES. SINCE TO DATE ON ALL SIDES PAID ATTENTION ON BUILDING A LEGAL STATE. IN LEGAL STATEHOOD IS FORMED SOCIAL JUSTICE, FREEDOM, WILL, PROVIDED SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL VALUES OF MAN, AND THUS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IN A LEGAL SYSTEM ON EQUAL LEVELS WILL LIVE. AND THEREFORE, THE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL STATEHOOD IN THE PUBLISHED WRITINGS OF THE KAZAKH THINKERS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
975	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES TO WHAT EXTENT TO LOCAL PRO-REFORM ACTORS MATTER IN INDONESIA THROUGH THE PRISM OF ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGNS IN THE COUNTRY'S REGIONS. I ARGUE THAT THE RASH OF ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGNS AND RELATED TRIALS INVOLVING LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY FROM MID-2004 ONWARD, CAN BE ATTRIBUTED NEITHER TO THE RESOURCES LAVISHED ON ANTI-CORRUPTION ORGANIZATIONS BASED IN JAKARTA, NOR TO THE POPULARITY OF PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO'S ANTI-CORRUPTION RHETORIC. INSTEAD, IT CAN BE TRACED TO A PARTICULAR ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN THAT BEGAN IN EARNEST IN 2002 IN PADANG, WEST SUMATRA. USING A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL APPROACH, A SMALL GROUP OF ACTIVISTS RELENTLESSLY PURSUED THEIR NEWLY ELECTED PROVINCIAL LEGISLATORS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR DEMOCRATIC MANDATES AND AS IMPORTANT, TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW PURSUANT TO NEW NATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION LEGISLATION. THE GUILTY VERDICTS OF MAY 2004 GALVANIZED SIMILAR GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO INVESTIGATE THEIR RESPECTIVE LEGISLATIVE BODIES. THIS EXEMPLARY CASE OF SOCIETAL ACCOUNTABILITY ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE LEVERAGE ACTIVISTS CAN GAIN OVER LOCAL POLITICIANS WHEN THEY FORGE COALITIONS WITH OTHER ELITE ACTORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN JAKARTA. I FURTHER EXPLORE TWO ANTI-CORRUPTION CASES IN THE PROVINCE OF WEST KALIMANTAN TO PLACE POST-PADANG DEVELOPMENTS IN THEIR PROPER PERSPECTIVE. IF HOPES WERE RAISED THAT REGIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION MOVEMENTS-BASED ON THE PADANG MODEL-MIGHT ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN SENSATIONAL TRIALS BUT HELP CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL BY HOLDING ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE, THESE TWO EXAMPLES SHOW HOW FLEETING THESE EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE. THE TRIALS THAT TOOK PLACE BUT WHICH PRODUCED NO CONVICTIONS RESULTED FROM THE FALLOUT OF LOCAL POLITICAL TUSSLES, AND NOT FROM LOCAL CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS GALVANIZED BY THE IDEALS OF TRANSPARENCY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.
976	USING PANEL DATA FOR 16 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FROM 2006 TO 2015, WE REPORT THERE ARE SIX STATISTICALLY EXPLANATORY VARIABLES FOR THE VARIATION OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF FIRMS IN THE CEE COUNTRIES SUCH AS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, PROTECTION OF MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST, WASTEFULNESS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING, FAVORITISM IN DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC TRUST IN POLITICIANS. BY USING PANEL DATA RELATED TO 16 CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS (2006-2015), WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF SPECIFIC LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE DETERMINANT FACTORS ON FIRMS' ETHICAL BEHAVIOR IN THE CEE REGION. THUS, WE REPORT THERE ARE CERTAIN STATISTICALLY EXPLANATORY VARIABLES FOR THE VARIATION OF ETHICAL CONDUCT OF FIRMS IN THE CEE COUNTRIES SUCH AS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE; STRENGTH OF INVESTOR PROTECTION; PROTECTION OF MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS INTEREST; WASTEFULNESS OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING; GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS; DIVERSION OF PUBLIC FUNDS; THE RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC TRUST IN POLITICIANS. THIS STUDY INDICATES THE NECESSITY FOR POLICYMAKERS AND POLITICAL LEADERS TO LOOK FOR PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THE NECESSARY ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS FOR IMPROVING FIRMS' ETHICAL BEHAVIOR IN CEE COUNTRIES.
977	FACED BY THE APPARENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGAL TRADITIONS, HOW SHOULD SCHOLARS AND POLICY MAKERS ASSESS THEIR COMPATIBILITY OR INCOMPATIBILITY? WHAT CRITERIA SHOULD BE USED TO ADJUDGE THE COMMENSURABILITY, OR EVEN THE ELEMENTS OF INCONGRUITY, BETWEEN TRADITIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN DIFFERENT CULTURAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES? THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A SHIFT FROM THE WAY THAT MUCH OF THE SCHOLARSHIP ON ISLAMIC LEGAL TRADITIONS IN WESTERN POLITIES PURSUES THESE QUESTIONS. FIRST, SCHOLARS ASSESS ISLAMIC LEGAL TRADITIONS BY EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY ASSESSING THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH A CONTINGENT WESTERN RENDITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. SECOND, COMPARISONS TEND TO FOCUS ON A WESTERN LEGAL THEORETICAL PRIORITY OF THE 'RULE' ITSELF, WHEREBY CONCEPTUALISATIONS OF LAW ARE PARSED OUT USING AN ANALYTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULAR TO THE CONTINGENT HISTORY OF THE NATION STATE. SUCH APPROACHES MAY USEFULLY ASSESS MIGRANT TRADITIONS' POLITICAL COMPATIBILITY WITH A BENEVOLENT OR HEGEMONIC WESTERN LEGAL REGIME. INDEED, THEY MAY BE DEFENDED PHILOSOPHICALLY ON THE BASIS OF 'DIFFERENCE BLIND' LEGAL ARRANGEMENTS OR SOME KIND OF MINIMAL SECULAR BASELINE OF GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, THESE APPROACHES ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR ADDRESSING THE PRIOR QUESTION OF COMMENSURABILITY. BASED ON ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA FROM THE SHIA MUSLIM TRADITION OF LEGAL TRAINING, I OFFER A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF TWO 'REPERTOIRES OF JUSTIFICATION' STANDING ASKANCE FROM THIS ANYHOW CONTINGENT RENDITION OF WESTERN LAW. THIS ACCOUNT SERVES AS A COUNTERPOINT TO RULE BASED APPROACHES, DEMONSTRATING WHY COMMENSURABILITY SHOULD BE ASSESSED THROUGH AN ATTENTIVENESS TO THE ALTERNATIVE LOGICS OF OTHER LEGAL TRADITIONS.
978	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DEMOCRATIC CRISIS EXPERIENCED BY BRAZIL FROM THE SECOND DECADE OF THE 21ST CENTURY ONWARDS. THE AIM IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW THIS HISTORICAL PERIOD CAN BE CHARACTERIZED. THE TEXT ASSERTS THAT IT IS INAPPROPRIATE TO UNDERSTAND BRAZIL WITHOUT OBSERVING ITS HISTORICAL DISTRUST OF DEMOCRACY AND LACK OF COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT BRAZILIAN MODERNIZATION IN THE TRANSITION FROM THE 20TH TO THE 21ST CENTURY WAS AMBIGUOUS BUT WITH IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE AUTHORITARIAN MENTALITY AND THE GAP IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION ARE FACTORS OF STRUCTURAL PERMANENCE. THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT BRAZIL IS EXPERIENCING A SPECIFIC MOMENT CHARACTERIZED BY THE AWAKENING OF AN AUTHORITARIAN AND CONSERVATIVE MENTALITY THAT IMPACTS BOTH THE STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DISCUSSION, WITH CONTRIBUTIONS IN HISTORY, POLITICAL SCIENCE, AND LAW. THE SUBJECTS ARE DISCUSSED IN THEORETICAL TERMS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION GAP, THE INEQUALITY BETWEEN CITIZENS, THE DIFFICULTIES OF CIVIC CULTURE (MAINLY IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT), AND SOME INHERENT WEAKNESSES IN DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE. STARTING FROM THE IDEA THAT CIVIC CULTURE INFLUENCES INSTITUTIONS AND THESE, IN TURN, IMPACT CIVIC CULTURE, BRAZIL IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A POLITICAL AND CULTURAL SETBACK. CONTRARY TO WHAT COULD BE IMAGINED A FEW YEARS AGO, THE PROCESS OF BRAZILIAN SOCIAL MODERNIZATION IS THREATENED IN ITS MOST IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS, WHICH IMPLIES A DANGER TO THE VALUES THAT SUSTAIN DEMOCRACY.
979	ACCOUNTABILITY IS A CENTRAL TOPIC IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TO HOLD PERSONS AND INSTITUTIONS EXECUTING PUBLIC POWER LEGALLY ACCOUNTABLE IN VARIOUS WAYS IS LINKED TO IDEAS OFGOOD GOVERNANCE, DEMOCRACY, LEGITIMACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LAST DECADES, ESTABLISHED STRUCTURES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED THROUGH PROCESSES OFPRIVATIZATION OFPUBLIC SERVICES, DIGITALIZATION AND A TREND OF FLEXIBILIZATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF CIVIL SERVANTS. ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF EUROPEANIZATION. AMONG THE VARIOUS TOOLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY, CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS CONSTITUTES THE MOST FAR-REACHING FORM OF MEASURES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THE AIM OF THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY IS TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON THE CHALLENGES IN DEFINING THE LEGAL STATUS AND THE SCOPE FOR THE CRIMINAL LIABILITY OF CIVIL SERVANTS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE DEVELOPMENTS JUST MENTIONED. THE CHOICE TO STUDY THREE NORDIC COUNTRIES (DENMARK, FINLAND AND SWEDEN) IS MADE AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE NORDIC COUNTRIES ALL BEING HIGHLY RANKED IN INTERNATIONAL SURVEYS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. ALONGSIDE INTRODUCING NORDIC SOLUTIONS FOR THE MODERN LIABILITY CHALLENGES, THE STUDY POINTS OUT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS DRIVEN BY EUROPEANIZATION, WHICH BRING NEW ELEMENTS INTO NORDIC THINKING.
980	FINALITY OF JUDGMENTS IS A CONCEPT THAT PUTS AN END TO THE TRIAL, PROHIBITING SUBSEQUENT APPEALS, OPENING OF NEW PROCEEDINGS AND DISPUTING CLEARLY ESTABLISHED FACTS. DESPITE BEING PROMOTED BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND ITS COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FAMILIAR TO MOST IF NOT ALL STATES, ITS APPLICATION STILL ENCOUNTERS MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN SOME EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. DEEPLY ROOTED IDEAS OF SUBSTANTIVE TRUTH AND THE PUBLIC ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY, A RATHER IDIOSYNCRATIC NOTION OF FAIR TRIAL AND THE RULE OF LAW ALL LEAD TO UNDERESTIMATION OF THE ROLE PLAYED BY FINALITY IN A PEACEFUL LIFE OF THE SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE EXPERIENCE OF UKRAINE (WHERE A MAJOR JUDICIAL REFORM HAS JUST TAKEN PLACE) AND LITHUANIA - TWO POST-SOVIET NATIONS THAT BOTH, STILL IN THEIR UNIQUE WAY, WORKED ON IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPLE OF FINALITY INTO THEIR PROCEDURAL ORDER. THE PAPER ALSO EXPLORES AN UNEASY BALANCE TO BE FOUND BETWEEN THIS NOTION AND OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS (ACCESS TO JUSTICE, RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL ECONOMY AND SOME OTHER).
981	IN MANY MODERN NATION STATES, BOTH RICH AND POOR, TRADITIONAL LAW TO THIS DAY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. GIVEN THE ALMOST UNIVERSAL PREVALENCE OF TRADITIONAL LAW, IT IS SURPRISING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT IT. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT TRIES TO TAKE STOCK OF TRADITIONAL LAW FROM A CROSS-COUNTRY PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE COMPATIBILITY OF TRADITIONAL LAW WITH STATE-ENFORCED LAW AND, IN PARTICULAR, WITH THE BASIC TRAITS OF THE RULE OF LAW. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF UP TO 134 COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT NO 'TYPICAL' TRADITIONAL LAW EXISTS, BUT THAT TRADITIONAL LAW VARIES IN MANY DIMENSIONS SUCH AS ITS TIMELY ENFORCEMENT, ITS IMPARTIALITY, AND ITS PROTECTION OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. SOCIETIES THAT RELY EXTENSIVELY ON TRADITIONAL LAW SCORE LOW REGARDING BOTH THE RULE OF LAW AND PER CAPITA INCOME. HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF THE CONTEMPORANEOUS RELIANCE ON TRADITIONAL LAW. STATE ANTIQUITY, FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCES THE PREVALENCE OF TRADITIONAL LAW, AS DOES A HIGH SHARE OF DESCENDANTS FROM EUROPEAN POPULATIONS.
982	EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION UDERTAKEN IN POST-SOVIET RUSSIA HAS BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A DEARTH OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT REALITIES OF JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION 'ON THE GROUND', AT THE LEVEL OF DISTRICTS OR TOWNS. THE AUTHOR'S RESEARCH PROJECT, AN IN DEPTH EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF A. SINGLE CRIMINAL COURT LOCATED IN THE SIBERIAN CITY OF KRASNOYARSK, REPRESENTS A STEP TOWARD FILLING THIS GAP. THIS PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS MADE RATHER LIMITED INROADS IN THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF CRIMINAL COURTS IN THE RUSSIAN DEEP PROVINCES. THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN EARNESTLY DECLARED LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND THE MUNDANE REALITY OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE IS LOOSE AND AT SOME JUNCTIONS NON-EXISTENT.

983	IN OUR CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL SYSTEM EXISTS SINCE 2004 WAYS OF PLEA BARGAINING THAT MODIFY THE CHARGES ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEFENDANT. IF THE DEFENDANTS PLEAD GUILTY OF THEIR CRIMES, THEY CAN OBTAIN BENEFITS LIKE A CHANGE IN THE TYPICITY OF THE IMPUTED CONDUCT. ALTHOUGH OUR ACCUSATORY CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IS A BIT OLD, THE JURISPRUDENCE CONTINUES WITH THE TASK OF DEFINING AND SPECIFYING THE SCOPE AND ESSENCE OF THESE WAYS OF NEGOTIATING THE DECLARATION OF GUILT. IN THIS DOCUMENT WE TRY TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THIS TASK ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS OF THE PLEA BARGAINING'S, BECAUSE THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED APPEALING TO COMPARATIVE LAW OR PRAGMATISM, BUT IT HAS BEEN IGNORED THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW, NOT TO THE OPERATION OF THE PROCESSES PENALTIES IN OTHER LATITUDES OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF ITS DECISIONS.
984	ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKER MS. GHISLAINE MAXWELL WAS SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS' IMPRISONMENT, MANY PEOPLE CLOSELY WATCHED THE SIXTH HEARING OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE ATTACK OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL ON 6 JANUARY 2021 (28 JUNE 2022). WHAT, IF ANYTHING, DO THESE OSTENSIBLY VARIED CRIMES HAVE IN COMMON? SEEKING TO ANSWER THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE USUALLY UNDER-RESEARCHED CONNECTION BETWEEN TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND THE DOCUMENTED DECLINE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES WORLDWIDE. GLOBALLY, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW APPEAR TO BE UNDER ASSAULT, AND THEREFORE THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES RELEVANT EXAMPLES OF HOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING CONTRIBUTES TO THE EROSION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, IN FICTION AND FACT, AND FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS ARTICLE TAKES US FROM 'PIZZAGATE' TO PROFITS.
985	RUSSIA'S INVASIONS OF UKRAINE CONFIRM THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE THAT GOVERNANCE OF PUBLIC GOODS (PGS) DEMANDED BY CITIZENS (SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRATIC PEACE, AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) AS UNIVERSALLY CONFIRMED BY THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY) DEPENDS ON DEFENDING PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM (SUCH AS CITIZENSHIP, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, `MIXED GOVERNMENT', AND COURTS OF JUSTICE), REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM (SUCH AS SEPARATION OF POWER, THE RULE OF LAW, AND JUS GENTIUM SINCE ANCIENT ROME), AND COMMON LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM (SUCH AS PARLIAMENTARY AND JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS) AGAINST ABUSES OF POWER. THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) AND ITS 2030 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA RECOMMEND THESE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES ALSO FOR MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE PROTECTING THE SDGS AND RELATED PGS. YET CONSTITUTIONALISM DEPENDS ON MULTILEVEL LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TRANSFORMING THE SDGS INTO CONCRETE DUTIES OF GOVERNMENTS AND CORRESPONDING RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF CITIZENS. THE GLOBAL HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENERGY, SECURITY, ECONOMIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS CRISES REVEAL THE SYSTEMIC `MARKET FAILURES', `GOVERNANCE FAILURES', AND `CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION DEFICITS' UNDERMINING UN AND WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION GOVERNANCE OF PGS. LIBERAL ORDER CAN ONLY SURVIVE AS `MILITANT CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOI-CRACY' IF CITIZENS DEFEND FREEDOM AGAINST TYRANNY AT HOME AND ABROAD, NOTABLY IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES WHICH, NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR FORMAL CONSTITUTIONS, SUPPRESS DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM.
986	THIS PAPER STUDIES A NEW PHENOMENON, THE 'TOP TO BOTTOM' CORRUPTION NETWORKS OF ORGANIZED CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN RUSSIA. WE EXAMINE THE SOVIET ROOTS OF CORRUPTION AND ITS TRANSFORMATION DURING TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. BY FOCUSING ON CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN CORRUPTION NETWORKS THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE COMPLEX OF STATE-RUN OLIGARCHIC STRUCTURE WITH ESTABLISHED RATES, WELL ORGANIZED INTER-INSTITUTIONAL GROUPS INCORPORATED BY COMMON IDEAS OF EXTRACTING PROFITS. THE DANGER IS IN THE EXISTENCE OF EXTENSIVE AND STABLE CORRUPTION NETWORKS, WHICH NOT ONLY PROFIT BY THEIR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES BETWEEN ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS AND LAW ENFORCEMENTS, BUT INVEST IN FURTHER CORRUPT DEVELOPMENTS TO CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARGUE THAT CORRUPTION IN RUSSIA, FOR A LONG TIME, HAS BEEN IMBEDDED IN THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL RELATIONS AND, BY THE MAJORITY OF CITIZENS, WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A CRIME. PRESENTING ARGUMENTS AGAINST EXISTING SIMPLIFIED UNDERSTANDING OF CORRUPTION, THIS STUDY ELUCIDATES CORRUPTION NETWORKS AS AN EXPANSION OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN ALL SPHERES OF POST-TOTALITARIAN RUSSIA. IT ALSO SHOWS THAT A MAGIC CIRCLE OF CORRUPTION CLOSELY INTERTWINES WITH THE INEFFICIENCY OF POWER AND THE INEFFICIENCY OF RULE OF LAW. (C) 2007 THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

987	A LOT OF WORKS ON THE THEORY OF LAW EXAMINE THE MECHANISM OF LAW, BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM HAS NOT BEEN AN OBJECT OF A SEPARATE STUDY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE THE CONCEPT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM AND IDENTIFY ITS ELEMENTS. THE RESEARCH MATERIALS WERE INTERNATIONAL ACTS, ACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION OF RUSSIA, JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS, SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. TO REACH THE AIM, BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WERE USED: ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION, ABSTRACTION, AND THE FORMAL LEGAL METHOD. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH, THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT GOAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM WAS IDENTIFIED. THIS GOAL IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL RELATIONS: IT IS A CERTAIN ORDER IN WHICH THE CORRESPONDING RIGHTS AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ARE ACTUALLY EXERCISED, AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR IS SUPPRESSED. THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM IS AN INTEGRATIVE SYSTEMIC LEGAL PHENOMENON. IT IS BASED ON SINGLE PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, EXISTS AND FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE ROLE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM. IT IS PROVED THAT PRINCIPLES AS THE MOST STABLE LEGAL STRUCTURES MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO FORM A STABLE LEGAL BASIS ESSENTIAL FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM. SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES ARE NAMED IN THE FEDERAL L AW "ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION"; THEY DIRECTLY DETERMINE THE INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA. ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM CONSISTS OF A SET OF CERTAIN INTERRELATED AND MUTUALLY DEPENDENT ELEMENTS. FOR THEIR PRODUCTIVE ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF EACH IN THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL REGULATION, A CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS IS PROPOSED. IN TERMS OF THE LEGAL FORM, THE LEGAL NORM, LEGAL FACT, LEGAL RELATIONSHIP, AND ACT OF IMPLEMENTATION ARE DISTINGUISHED. THESE ELEMENTS ARE QUITE TRADITIONAL FOR LEGAL SCIENCE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE FACT THAT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DIVERSITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE STATE STRUCTURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM OPERATES AT CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED LEVELS. THE ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES SPECIFIC INSTRUMENTAL ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MECHANISM. THEY ARE UNEVENLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE MECHANISM OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REGULATION, AND THEIR INTEGRATED USE IS REQUIRED.
988	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS FOR THE IMPLANTATION OF THE EU DIGITAL AGENDA. ITS IMPACT BOTH IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LIFE IS OMNIPRESENT. AI HAS BECOME AN INHERENT PART OF THE POLITICAL LIFE SINCE POLITICIANS USE IT FOR SEVERAL REASONS, SUCH AS TO PROMOTE THEIR STRATEGY AS WELL AS TO ACHIEVE BETTER AND CLOSER COMMUNICATION WITH PEOPLE. ALL THIS IS BASED ON THE EXISTING SET OF LEGAL RULES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES, BOTH ETHICAL AND LEGAL, WHICH POSE A WIDE RANGE OF CONCERNS: FROM THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS TO THE SAFEGUARD OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW. THE CORE QUESTION IS THE FOLLOWING: DOES AI STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY OR LEAD TO ITS DETERIORATION? THIS PAPER AIMS AT DEMONSTRATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AI IN POLITICS. FIRSTLY, THERE WILL BE PURSUED, VIA A JURIDICAL METHODOLOGY, A DESCRIPTION OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK GOVERNING AI, IN CONNECTION WITH JUSTICE AND DEMOCRACY. FOLLOWING A CRITICAL APPROACH, THERE WILL BE AN ANALYSIS OF PRINCIPAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONCERNS REGARDING THE NECESSITY AND/OR EFFICIENCY OF USE OF AI IN POLITICAL LIFE. FINALLY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE PAPER IS TO STIMULATE CRITICAL THINKING AND SUGGEST FRUITFUL PROPOSALS FOR THE SAFEGUARD OF THE DEMOCRACY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TRUSTFUL AND POWERFUL DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT.
989	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A BRIEF CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S JANUARY 2019 "REPORT ON INVESTOR CITIZENSHIP AND RESIDENCE SCHEMES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION". SINCE IT IS THE FIRST DETAILED DOCUMENT BY THE COMMISSION OUTLINING THIS INSTITUTION'S POSITION ON THE MATTERS OF INVESTMENT RESIDENCE AND CITIZENSHIP, AND GIVEN THE COMMISSION'S RECENTLY ARTICULATED INTENTIONS TO TAKE CYPRUS AND MALTA TO COURT OVER THEIR INVESTMENT MIGRATION LAW AND PRACTICE, THE REPORT IN QUESTION IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. THE DOCUMENT SETS THE LEGAL-POLITICAL CONTEXT OF THE REGULATION OF THE MIGRATION OF WEALTHY THIRD-COUNTRY NATIONALS IN EUROPE. IT IS ALSO DEEPLY FLAWED. RATHER THAT SUMMARISING THE DOCUMENT, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON FIVE CORE DEFICIENCIES OF THE COMMISSION'S EMBARRASSING PRODUCT AND DEMONSTRATES HOW THE COMMISSION FAILED TO GET THE EU'S OWN LAW RIGHT, IN ADDITION TO SHOWING A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ON THE MATTER. RIPE WITH NATIONALIST ASSUMPTIONS NOT ROOTED IN THE TREATIES OR THE SECONDARY LAW OF THE UNION AND SHOWCASING A TIMID, CONVOLUTED AND INCONSISTENT ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES IT PURPORTS TO ADDRESS, THE REPORT HAS UNSURPRISINGLY FAILED TO CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE OF REGULATION IN THE FIELD OF INVESTMENT CITIZENSHIP AND RESIDENCE IN THE EU OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. WHAT IT DID MAKE CLEAR, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE MERE POLITICAL SUSPICION OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF NATURALISATION IS ENOUGH FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO SET ASIDE THE LAW AND MISINFORM THE PUBLIC, UNDERLYING ONCE AGAIN THE PROBLEMATIC TENSION BETWEEN THE GROWING POLITICAL NATURE OF THIS INSTITUTION AND ITS KEY TASK AS GUARDIAN OF THE TREATIES. THERE IS A BURNING NEED FOR THE COMMISSION TO TAKE A MORE CAREFUL, COHERENT AND INFORMED APPROACH TO ITS ACTIONS, AN APPROACH INDISPENSABLE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNION.
990	PURPOSE THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES IN THE BALTIC STATES AND THE SOUTH CAUCASUS COUNTRIES FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007 AND IS SET WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR BUSINESSES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE ARTICLE USES THE CROSS-SECTIONAL DATASET FROM THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE SURVEY (BEEPS) FOR 2009 TO EXAMINE ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES AND THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE BALTIC STATES AND THE SOUTH CAUCASUS COUNTRIES. AN ORDERED PROBIT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE IS USED TO MODEL ACCESS TO FINANCE AND THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE BALTIC STATES AND THE SOUTH CAUCASUS COUNTRIES. THE ANALYSIS DRAWS UPON INSTITUTIONAL THEORY TO EXPLAIN ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW VARIATIONS FROM ONE BALTIC STATE AND SOUTH CAUCASUS COUNTRY TO ANOTHER IN RELATION TO FAIRNESS, SPEED OF JUSTICE AND ENFORCEMENT OF COURT DECISIONS. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT IF ACCESS TO FINANCE IS NOT AN OBSTACLE TO BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE COURT SYSTEM IS FAIR, IMPARTIAL AND UNCORRUPTED, IT DETERMINES THE LIKELIHOOD OF STRENGTH IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, WITHIN THE BALTIC REGION, BUSINESSES EXPERIENCING CONSTRAINTS IN ACCESSING FINANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE FEMALES AS THEIR TOP MANAGERS. HOWEVER, FOR THE SOUTH CAUCASUS REGION, THERE WAS NO GENDER DIFFERENCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH IS BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM THE BALTIC STATES AND THE SOUTH CAUCASUS REGION. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT TO DISCUSSIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTEXT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE RULE OF LAW. THE INSTITUTIONAL THEORY PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION FOR COERCIVE, NORMATIVE AND MIMETIC INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES. COERCIVE INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM EXERTS A DEPENDENCE ON ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES. IN COERCIVE INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM, FORMAL AND INFORMAL PRESSURES ARE EXERTED BY EXTERNAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS GOVERNMENTS, LEGAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, BANKS AND OTHER LENDING INSTITUTIONS. THESE FORMAL AND INFORMAL PRESSURES ARE IMPOSED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE AS A DEPENDENCY FOR SUCCESSFUL ACCESS TO FINANCE GOAL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH CREATES AWARENESS AMONG ENTREPRENEURS, POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS, BUSINESS PRACTITIONERS AND SOCIETY THAT REDUCING OBSTACLES TO ACCESS FINANCE AND A FAIR COURT SYSTEM IMPROVE ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE FORMATION. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE EMPLOYMENT, ADVANCE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER MAKES AN ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION BY EMPHASISING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ACCESS TO FINANCE AND A FAIR COURT SYSTEM IN ENCOURAGING STRONGER ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A DEFINITION FOR COERCIVE INSTITUTIONAL ISOMORPHISM TO SHOW HOW EXTERNAL FORCES EXERT A DEPENDENCE PRESSURE TOWARDS ACCESS TO FINANCE FOR SMES.
991	IN 2017, FORMER PERUVIAN PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI WAS PARDONED AFTER SERVING LESS THAN HALF OF A 25-YEAR SENTENCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THE MEASURE WAS TAKEN AMIDST POLITICAL TURMOIL AND AN IMPEACHMENT PROCESS LED BY THE FUJIMORISTA PARTY AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT PEDRO PABLO KUCZYNSKI. FUJIMORI'S VICTIMS IN THE BARRIOS ALTOS AND LA CANTUTA CASES REQUESTED THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (IACTHR) TO ANNUL THE PARDON DUE TO ITS INCOMPATIBILITY WITH PERU'S HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS. THE IACTHR DECIDED THAT IT WAS FOR THE PERUVIAN COURTS TO EXERCISE JURISDICTIONAL CONTROL OVER THE PARDON, THUS AFFIRMING ITS SUBSIDIARY ROLE. THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF THE POLITICAL SITUATION, THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF THE IACTHR'S JURISPRUDENCE ON AMNESTIES, AND RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE IACTHR HAD SUFFICIENT GROUNDS TO OVERTURN THE PARDON. THE COURT'S RESOLUTION TO REFER THE MATTER TO THE PERUVIAN JURISDICTION MAY BE EXPLAINED BY AN INCREASING AWARENESS OF ITS SUBSIDIARY ROLE, PARTICULARLY REGARDING SENSITIVE POLITICAL ISSUES.
992	MILLIONS OF CHINA'S ETHNIC MINORITY CITIZENS REMAIN SUBJECT TO COMPETING LEGAL STANDARDS, EVEN AS STATE OFFICIALS STRIVE TO STRENGTHEN A UNIFIED NOTION OF STATE LAW. MINORITY CUSTOMARY LAW CONTINUES TO BIND MANY MINORITY CITIZENS IN BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL ARENAS AND OFTEN CONFLICTS DIRECTLY WITH STATE LAW. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE LAWS CONFLICT? BASED ON FIELDWORK IN YUNNAN, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW LOCAL OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES NAVIGATE LEGAL PLURALISM AND WHAT LEGAL AND POLICY PROVISIONS GUIDE THEM. GRANTING LOCAL JUDGES DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO SET ASIDE STATE LAW IN FAVOUR OF CUSTOMARY LAW, ALTHOUGH SEEMINGLY UNDERMINING LAW ENFORCEMENT, MAY IN THE LONG RUN BE THE BEST PATH TO STRENGTHENING RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S MINORITY REGIONS.
993	SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM WIDE-SPREAD AND DEEPLY ROOTED CORRUPTION. THIS ARTICLE IS CONCERNED WITH THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SOURCES OF CORRUPTION AND DISRESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA (RC), WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION BEING PAID TO TAX EVASION. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RC HAS EXPRESSED A DETERMINATION TO UNDERTAKE MEASURES AGAINST CORRUPTION AND TAX EVASION, IT FACES CRITICISM THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST THESE SOCIAL EVILS IS NOT BEING GIVEN SUFFICIENT POLITICAL SUPPORT AND RESPECT. WHILE IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE RUN UP TO JOINING THE EU THE RC HAS ENACTED DIFFERENT LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS TARGETED TOWARDS THE REDUCTION OF CORRUPTION; A SERIOUS PROBLEM REMAINS IN THE LOW LEVEL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. CROATIA'S INEFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEM AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY HAVE CONSEQUENTLY PRESENTED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO INVESTORS. MOREOVER, THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IS OFTEN HAMPERED BY AN INEFFICIENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND A LACK OF INTRA-GOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION.
994	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW ARGUMENTS RELATED TO URGENCY AND CRISIS AFFECTED THE QUALITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN RELATION TO THREE CASES OF LAW-MAKING RELATED TO THE SO-CALLED REFUGEE CRISIS IN 2015/2016 IN SWEDEN. IT IS ARGUED THAT DEROGATIONS FROM THE STEPS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BASED ON A FEELING OF URGENCY ARE DETRIMENTAL FOR THE QUALITY OF THE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION AND, IN A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE, ALSO FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
995	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS PALOMBELLA'S RECENT ATTEMPT TO REFASHION THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR A DENSELY GLOBALLY CONNECTED SOCIETY AND RESOLVE THE MODERN STATE'S PERENNIAL OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE GOOD - BETWEEN LAW AS A GUARANTEE OF INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND LAW AS A POLITICAL INSTRUMENT OF COLLECTIVE BENEFIT - IN THE NEW GLOBAL SETTING. THE PAPER ANALYZES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO MODES OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW, ONE CONCERNED WITH MULTILEVEL GLOBAL LEGAL ARCHITECTURE AND THE OTHER WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF DISCRETE TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. PALOMBELLA UNDERLINES THAT BOTH OF THESE MODES HAVE TO BE MATCHED BY FORMS OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT. GLOBAL LAW IS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF NEW SPECIALIST SYSTEMS OF REGULATION AND ALSO ABOUT THE PATTERNS OF CONNECTION AMONGST THESE, AS WELL AS BETWEEN THEM AND STATE LEGAL ORDERS. THE CHALLENGE IS TO IMAGINE AND TO FACILITATE A PATTERN OF MUTUAL CONSTITUTION BETWEEN THESE LEGAL MARKS AND TRANSNATIONAL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.
996	FRANK HERBERT'S DUNE SERIES HAS BEEN ANALYZED WITH REGARD TO VARIOUS ISSUES, SUCH AS POLITICS, ECOLOGY AND RELIGION. ITS LEGAL ASPECTS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED SO FAR. CONTRARY TO THE SEEMINGLY COMMON PERCEPTION THAT LAW DOES NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DUNE, THIS ARTICLE WILL FIRST SHOW THAT LAW IS INDEED UBIQUITOUS IN DUNE AND SHAPES THE NARRATIVE IN IMPORTANT WAYS. DUNE DEVELOPS DIFFERENT LEGAL CULTURES: A CYNICAL RULE BY LAW IN THE IMPERIUM AND AN EARNEST RULE OF LAW AMONG THE NATIVE FREMEN. IT REFLECTS ON THE LIMITS OF LAW IN A WAY THAT IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY A TYPE OF COLLECTIVE DETERMINISM FIRST DEVELOPED IN LEO TOLSTOY'S WAR AND PEACE, A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN NOTICED UNTIL NOW. DUNE REFLECTS A PROFOUND DISTRUST OF ORGANIZED AUTHORITY. ULTIMATELY, IT UNDERVALUES THE FACT THAT LAW CAN SERVE TO PREVENT ABUSE OF POWER. BUT TO DO SO, THE LAW NEEDS INDEPENDENT GUARDIANS WHICH ARE CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT IN DUNE.
997	LEGAL UNCERTAINTY IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS OF THE ANTITRUST LAW THAT IS CAUSED BY THE WAY THE LAW IS ENFORCED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, THE WAY COMPETITION POLICY HAS DEVELOPED, AND ITS UNDERLYING ECONOMIC THEORY. LEGAL UNCERTAINTY REVEALS ITSELF IN THE ABSENCE OF A UNIFORM GOAL OF COMPETITION POLICY BOTH AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC THEORY, AND AT THE LEVEL OF ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES. IN ITS TURN, THE WAY COMPETITION POLICY HAS DEVELOPED, AND THE WAY IT IS IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AFFECT ECONOMIC THEORY IN GENERAL AND THE DEFINITION OF COMPETITION IN PARTICULAR. IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE GOALS OF COMPETITION POLICY NOT ONLY FAIL TO CORRESPOND TO THE ONES IT WAS CREATED FOR, BUT CONTRADICT THEM. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC THEORY AT SOME POINT IN THE HISTORY OF COMPETITION POLICY, AND BY THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER ECONOMIC POLICIES ON THE GOALS OF COMPETITION POLICY. THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF COMPETITION POLICY FROM THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT ALLOWS TO IDENTIFY NEW ASPECTS OF THE KEY PROBLEMS OF COMPETITION POLICY. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE REVIEWS THE ISSUE OF COMPETITION AS A MARKET STRUCTURE, AS A BEHAVIOR OF A COMPANY IN THE MARKET, AND AS AN OUTCOME OF SOME BEHAVIOR OF A COMPANY IN THE MARKET. THESE APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF COMPETITION DO NOT ALWAYS COMPLY WITH EACH OTHER AND SOMETIMES ARE CONTRADICTIVE. THE ISSUE OF A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND RULE OF REASON APPROACHES IS ALSO TOUCHED UPON.
998	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE CITIZENS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN 24 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF CONTEXTUAL AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS ON PERCEPTIONS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. USING AS A DATASET THE 2012 EUROPEAN SOCIAL SURVEY, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CITIZENS RESPOND POSITIVELY WHEN THE MEDIA PROVIDES RELIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH TO JUDGE THE GOVERNMENT, WHEN INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVE THAT GOVERNMENTS PERFORM WELL, WHEN INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN MORE EXTENSIVE AND GENEROUS WELFARE STATES AND WHEN THEY LIVE IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. IN ADDITION, THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT COMPARED TO POLITICALLY LEFT-WING CITIZENS, RIGHT-WING SUPPORTERS HAVE, ON AVERAGE, A HIGHER PERCEPTION OF GOVERNMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE FINDINGS SHOW STRONG POSITIVE EVALUATIONS OF RIGHT-WING GOVERNMENTS BY RIGHT-WING VOTERS IN COMPARISON WITH LEFT-WING GOVERNMENTS BY LEFT-WING VOTERS.
999	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXPEDITION OF THE LAW 1437 OF 2011 LIMITED THE ORGANIC CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSEJO DE ESTADO FOR CONTRACTUAL CONFLICTS OF SERVICE PUBLIC OPERATORS, REQUIRING IN ADDITION, THAT THE CONTRACT INCLUDES OR MUST INCLUDE EXORBITANT CLAUSES. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE AUTHOR ANALYSES THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC SERVICE, THE CHANGES IT HAS UNDERGONE, AND ITS RECEPTION BY NATIONAL LAW, UNDERSTANDING THE PUBLIC SERVICE AS AN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY GOVERNED BY THE SOCIAL STATE UNDER RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, IT POINTS OUT THE ABSENCE OF A SINGLE CRITERIA REGARDING COMPETENT JURISDICTION FOR THIS CONTRACTUAL CONFLICTS, BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE RULINGS.
