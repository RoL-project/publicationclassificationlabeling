999	Plato's Laws	Reassessment of Plato's Laws in Legal Thought	Plato's Laws; legal thought; natural law theory; positivist account; rule of law; enkratic civic reason; substantive moral reason; political pragmatism; history of legal thought; moral significance	This cluster of papers focuses on a reassessment of Plato's Laws in the history of legal thought. It argues that the traditional view of the Laws presenting a natural law theory is incorrect, and instead proposes a positivist account of the nature of law. The analysis delves into key passages of the Laws to identify its association with enkratic civic reason and its conflict with substantive moral reason. Furthermore, it discusses the rule of law as a precondition of a legal system, devoid of inherent moral significance, and emphasizes the role of political pragmatism over moral considerations.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_laws
