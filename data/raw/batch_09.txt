0	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE THEORY INCREASINGLY MANIFESTS A DIVISION BETWEEN THOSE WHO SEE THE FIELD AS ADDING VALUE TO CONTEMPORARY LIBERAL PEACE MISSIONS IN POST-CONFLICT STATES AND THOSE WHO ARGUE ITS ROOTS IN THIS PARADIGM HAVE RESULTED IN AN UNDULY RESTRICTIVE VISION OF JUSTICE. WHERE BOTH MAINSTREAM SCHOLARS AND CRITICS FIND RARE CONSENSUS IS THAT TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS A CORE COMPONENT, AS OPPOSED TO A MERELY MARGINAL ASPECT, OF THE LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING ENTERPRISE. A BELIEF IN THE CENTRALITY OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE TO LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING IS HELD IN COMMON BY CRITICAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE SCHOLARS WHO ARGUE IT REPLICATES ITS PATHOLOGIES AND MORE ENTHUSIASTIC SCHOLARS WHO VIEW IT AS CENTRAL TO EFFORTS TO GROUND RIGHTS-BASED AND DEMOCRATIC CULTURES. HOWEVER, THIS BELIEF IN THE FIELD'S INDISPENSABILITY TO THE LIBERAL PEACE IS NOT BORNE OUT BY ACTUAL PEACEBUILDING PRACTICE, WHERE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS OFTEN NEGLECTED, MARGINALIZED OR SIMPLY NOT PURSUED AT ALL. THE APPARENT EMBRACE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN PEACEBUILDING MISSIONS APPROXIMATES WHAT SOCIOLOGICAL INSTITUTIONALISTS LABEL 'CEREMONIAL CONFORMITY' WHERE AN ACTOR ADOPTS POLICIES RHETORICALLY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A STREAM OF NORMATIVE AND REPUTATIONAL BENEFITS FOR ITS LEGITIMACY, BUT DOES NOT OR CANNOT COMPLY WITH THOSE COMMITMENTS. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS SUPPORTIVE OF LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING OUTCOMES AT MOST, BUT IS NOT OF DECISIVE IMPORTANCE AND CANNOT BE SAID TO BE A CORE COMPONENT IN THE WAY THAT DEMOCRATIZATION, RULE OF LAW OR SECURITY SECTOR REFORM ARE. IT IS NEITHER AS COMPLICIT IN LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING'S INIQUITIES AS CRITICS DAMN IT WITH, NOR AS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE GROUNDING OF DEMOCRATIC CULTURES AS ITS ADVOCATES PROPOSE. ALL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROJECTS ARE FACED WITH A CHOICE OF INTEGRATION WITH LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING OR DISASSOCIATION FROM IT-THIS CHOICE CAN ONLY BE MADE EFFECTIVELY IF ACTORS WITHIN THE FIELD BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR EFFORTS COMPLEMENT OR RESIST THE WIDER LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING PROCESS.
1	THE PAPER, AFTER THEORETICAL PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS, AS REGARDS PARTENALISM AND SELF-HARM WILL, STARTING FROM THE RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN SOCIAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE MODERN PENAL SYSTEMS OF THE RULE OF LAW, OPENS A PERSPECTIVE TOWARDS A WELL DEFINED CONCEPT OF LIBERAL-SOLIDARITY BASED 'FRATERNALISM', BEING COMPATIBLE WITH A QUITE MODERATE ANTI-PATERNALISTIC APPROACH. THE RESEARCH, THEN, IS FOCUSED ON SELF-DETERMINATION, WITHIN A NEUROSCIENTIFIC CONTEXT, DESCRIBING THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF REGULATION, IN CASE TYPICAL COGNITIVE MISTAKES ARE MADE AND THEN SHOWING A POSSIBLE SOLUTION IN EXCULPATORY PROCEDURES, AN INSTRUMENT CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL FOR BALANCING THE SOLIDARITY BASED APPROACH WITH THE QUITE MODERATE ANTIPATERNALISTIC APPROACH. THE MODEL HERE DESCRIBED, CAN BE DEFINED AS A PROCEDURALIZATION AIMING AT AVOIDING ANY POSSIBLE TYPICAL COGNITIVE MISTAKES, AND APPLIED TO THE EXAMPLIFYING HYPOTHESIS OF DRUG LEGALIZATION, THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUGGEST THE USE OF THE HARM PRINCIPLE AS AN USEFUL INSTRUMENT FOR DELIMITING THE CONCEPT OF "HARM TO OTHERS", AS WELL AS FOR DEFINING THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF THE PENAL SANCTION IN THE PROCEDURE AIMING AT CONTRASTING COGNITIVE VULNERABILITIES. CONCLUSIONS ARE CONSCIOUSLY FOCUSED ON THE FREEDOM OF 'MAKING MISTAKES' TO ONE'S OWN HARM, WITH A SOLUTION FALLING WITHIN THE SO CALLED 'FRATERNAL' LAW, WHICH OPPOSES THE CONCEPT OF 'PATERNAL' LAW. THE 'FRATERNAL' POINT OF VIEW OF PENAL LAW IS ABLE TO LEGITIMATE THOSE RULES AIMING AT 'CONTAINING', WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS, CHOICES THAT AT FIRST SEEM TO BE OF A SELF-HARM KIND, WHEN THEY CAN BE THE PRODUCT OF COGNITIVE LIMITATIONS. THE STATE, THEN, IS NOT LEGITIMATED TO BEHAVE LIKE A 'FATHER', BUT RATHER LIKE A KIND OF OLDER 'BROTHER' HAVING THE TASK OF SUGGESTING, ORIENTING, WITHOUT IMPOSING, A TOTALITARIAN VIEW OF THE OTHERS' GOOD.
2	TOBACCO COMPANIES AND TOBACCO EXPORTING WTO MEMBERS HAVE INITIATED AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DISPUTES IN NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND WORLDWIDE JURISDICTIONS AND INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATIONS CHALLENGING THE LEGAL CONSISTENCY OF TOBACCO CONTROL MEASURES SUCH AS AUSTRALIA'S "TOBACCO PLAIN PACKAGING" LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE, INVESTMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW. THE DEFENDANT COUNTRIES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TEND TO JUSTIFY TOBACCO-CONTROL MEASURES BY INVOKING PUBLIC HEALTH PROVISIONS IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW AM, DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS, PUBLIC HEALTH LEGISLATION, HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON TOBACCO CONTROL (FCTC) RATIFIED BY 177 UN MEMBER STATES. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY ASKING HOW THE FRAGMENTED SYSTEMS OF MULTILEVEL HEALTH, ECONOMIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE INTERPRETED AND COORDINATED IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THEIR MUTUAL LEGAL COHERENCE. IT THEN EXPLORES HOW MULTILEVEL COURTS SHOULD "ADMINISTER JUSTICE" IN TOBACCO CONTROL DISPUTES WITH DUE REGARD TO THEIR DIVERSE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS, APPLICABLE LAWS AND METHODS OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT MULTILEVEL JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN TOBACCO CONTROL DISPUTES REQUIRES JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN APPLYING "CONSTITUTIONAL METHODOLOGIES" (E.G. REGARDING "BALANCING" OF COMPETING RIGHTS, PROPORTIONALITY OF RESTRICTIONS, REASONABLE JUDICIAL JUSTIFICATIONS PROMOTING 'PUBLIC REASON'), MUTUALLY "CONSISTENT INTERPRETATIONS" (E.G. BASED ON THE "INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE" LIMITING LEGAL "FRAGMENTATION') AND "JUDICIAL COMITY" (E.G. REGARDING RULE OF LAW, RESPECTING "MARGINS OF APPRECIATION", PROTECTING "ACCESS TO JUSTICE') SO AS TO AVOID INCOHERENT JUDGMENTS. THE MAIN LESSON FROM MORE THAN 2500 YEARS OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL EXPERIENCES E.G. SINCE THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS (500 BC) WITH COLLECTIVE PROTECTION OF "PUBLIC GOODS" (RES PUBLICA) DEMANDED BY CITIZENS REMAINS THE NEED FOR LIMITING ABUSES OF POWER THROUGH MULTILEVEL "REPUBLICAN CONSTITUTIONALISM" PROVIDING FOR LEGAL, JUDICIAL AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS.
3	THE GOMERY INQUIRY ON SPONSHORSHIP AND GOVERNMENTAL ADVERTISING DOES NOT REQUIRE A REVISION OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACT ADJUDICATION. THE ACTUAL CONSTRAINTS ARE NOT TOO RIGID AND DO NOT HARM ADMINISTRATIVE EFFECTIVENESS. THE LEGAL REGIME OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRACTS IS WELL-KNOWN; WE GIVE HERE A BRIEF SKETCH OF IT. ONLY ONE ENACTMENT HAS BEEN MODIFIED AFTER THE CRISIS RAISED BY THE SCANDAL: THE FAMOUS APPENDIX Q OF TREASURY BOARD POLICY GUIDELINES RELATING TO ADVERTISING CONTRACTS. THE BODY OF RULES MAY PREVENT LAXISM AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE PRACTICE OF ETHICAL CONDUCT. IT CAN INSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY EVEN IN CONTRACTUAL ACTIVITIES MOST SENSIBLE WHERE THE CHOICE OF CONTRACTORS REQUIRE A QUALITATIVE APPRAISAL, OR WHERE AN ELEMENT OF PERSONAL TRUST IS INVOLVED. WHY THE QUESTION OF CONTRACT ADJUDICATION IS SO WORRYING? SURELY SKIDDINGS LIKE THE ONES RELATED BLUNTLY IN THE REPORTS OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OR COMMISSIONNER GOMERY MUST BE SHUNNED. BUT THE QUESTION IS STILL ALWAYS WITH US; THE CANADIAN PRESS, IN APRIL 2006, RELATES COSTLY IRREGULARITIES IN THE AWARDING OF COMPUTER SERVICES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; ON MARCH 12, IT MENTIONS IRREGULAR PRACTICES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY, AND SO FORTH... THE SETTING OF CONTRACT ADJUDICATION IN THE FIELD OF ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIP BY GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THE TREASURY BOARD POLICY APPEARS TO US QUITE ADEQUATE AND SHOULD PREVENT NEW FAILURES. BUT THE BEST ENACTMENTS ENFORCED BY OFFICERS SHOWING NO SCRUPLES OR HAVING A WEAK ETHICS MAY HARDLY ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE MISBEHAVIOUR. ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE MUST NOT NEGLECT THE RULES OF CRIMINAL LAW AND OF ETHICAL CONDUCT CODES, THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN BY POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC SERVANTS AT THE TIME OF THE SPONSORSHIP SCANDAL.
4	HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES, TO WHICH INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS ADHERE, SERVE NOT ONLY AS THE WORKING PREMISE FOR ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS BUT ALSO CONSTITUTE AN INHERENT PART OF THEIR LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS. ESTABLISHED BY STATES THAT CLAIM TO SHARE A FUNDAMENTAL SET OF VALUES FROM THE OUTSET AND ARE COMMITTED TO REFLECTING THESE VALUES THROUGHOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES, THE AFRICAN UNION IS NO EXCEPTION. THE ORGANISATION ARTICULATED ITS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND VALUES IN ITS FOUNDING TREATIES, WHICH INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, 'RESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.' OVER TIME, VARIOUS PREVENTIVE, MONITORING, AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO REALISE THESE HUMAN RIGHTS OBJECTIVES IN THE CONTINENT. THIS PROGRESS INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE AFRICAN COMMISSION IN 1987 AND THE CREATION OF THE AFRICAN COURT IN 1998, AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS JURISDICTION OF SUB-REGIONAL COURTS OVER TIME. THIS ARTICLE DELVES INTO THE RESISTANCE FACED BY THE JUDICIAL MECHANISMS USED TO ENFORCE HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFRICA. AS DEMONSTRATED, IN ALL CASES UNDER DISCUSSION, A STATE SUBJECT TO AN ADVERSE RULING OF THE COURT RESPONDED BY QUESTIONING ITS LEGITIMACY AND AUTHORITY, ADVOCATING FOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS TO WEAKEN THE FLEDGLING HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM ON THE CONTINENT. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALL CASES, ILLUSTRATING THAT THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL REACTION IN THE CASE OF THE CONTINENTAL AFRICAN COURT AND THE SADC TRIBUNAL HAS BEEN MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN THE ECOWAS AND THE EACJ COURT. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF THE COURTS, THE SCALE OF THE COMMUNITY, RELATIVE STATE POWER, THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE JUDGMENT, THE REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN CONSENSUS TO REVISE THE FOUNDING TREATY OF THE COURTS, AND THE ENGAGEMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETIES PLAYED CRUCIAL ROLES IN DETERMINING THE TYPE AND OUTCOME OF BACKLASH IN THE CASES UNDER DISCUSSION.
5	TO STYMIE COVID-19'S SPREAD, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSED SWEEPING AND BURDENSOME LOCKDOWN MEASURES THAT CRUSHED AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND INTERFERED WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY. DESPITE INTERFERING WITH MANY AMERICANS' PROPERTY RIGHTS, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE CON-SISTENTLY PREVAILED ON PANDEMIC-RELATED REGULATORY TAKINGS CLAIMS IN FED-ERAL COURT. BY FORCING GOVERNMENTS TO PAY FOR DEPRIVATIONS, THE TAKINGS CLAUSE CAN THWART ARBITRARY INTERFERENCE WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY. HOWEVER, THE DISPENSATION OF REGULATORY TAKINGS CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF PANDEMIC-RE-LATED REGULATIONS SUGGESTS THAT THE TAKINGS CLAUSE MAY PRESENTLY FAIL TO ADEQUATELY THWART ARBITRARY PROPERTY INTERFERENCE IN THE PARTIAL REGULATORY TAKINGS CONTEXT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMS THAT IT IS ACTING IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY. THIS NOTE EXPANDS ON EXISTING LITERATURE AND DETAILS HOW SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS MAY PRESENTLY ONLY PROTECT PROPERTY FROM EXTREMELY ARBITRARY OR DESPOTIC INTERFERENCE. THIS NOTE THEN ARGUES THAT WHEN SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS FAILS TO THWART ARBITRARY INTERFERENCE, THE REGULATORY TAKINGS DOC-TRINE WILL ALSO FAIL TO SHIELD PROPERTY WHEN INTERFERENCE IS SUBSTANTIAL BUT IS MADE PURSUANT TO STATES' POLICE POWERS. BECAUSE BOTH DOCTRINES MAY SIM-ULTANEOUSLY FAIL TO STYMIE ARBITRARINESS, THIS NOTE CONTENDS THAT OUR RE -PUBLIC MAY CONSTITUTIONALLY TOLERATE ARBITRARY PROPERTY INTERFERENCE, A PHE-NOMENON HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. TO INCENTIVIZE LEGITIMATE AND PRINCIPLED DECISION-MAKING, AND TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM AR-BITRARY INTERFERENCE, THIS NOTE URGES STATES TO PASS LAWS THAT RESEMBLE THE TEXAS PRIVATE REAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PRESERVATION ACT. THESE LAWS SHOULD, AT A MINIMUM: (1) REQUIRE GOVERNMENTS TO COMPENSATE PROPERTY OWNERS FOR REGULATORY DIMINUTIONS IN PROPERTY VALUE THAT EXCEED A LEGISLATIVELY CALIBRATED THRESHOLD; (2) EXCUSE COMPENSATION WHEN GOVERNMENTS CAN SATISFY A FORM OF HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY; AND (3) PERMIT GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK IMMUNITY FROM A LAW'S REQUIREMENTS IN EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
6	DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND THE SHARING ECONOMY CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES BY RELEASING UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS AND REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS; THIS OPENS UP ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND CHANGING CONSUMPTION PATTERNS NECESSITATE THE ADJUSTMENT AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. THE AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO MODEL THE IMPACT OF THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE PLATFORM ECONOMY AND THE SHARING ECONOMY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WE APPLY THEORETICAL ANALYSIS TO SHOW POSSIBLE IMPACT OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND THE SHARING ECONOMY; ON THIS BASIS, FOUR RELEVANT HYPOTHESES ARE FORMULATED. IN THE STUDY, WE USE DATA FROM THE DIGITAL PLATFORM ECONOMY INDEX 2020, SMART CITY INDEX 2021, WJP RULE OF LAW INDEX 2020, SOCIAL CAPITAL INDEX 2020, BAROMETR TRUST INDEX 2021 FOR 26 COUNTRIES. WITH THE HELP OF A CORRELATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS, WE CONSTRUCT LINEAR MODELS DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLATFORM ECONOMY, AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS ON THE SERVICES OF THE SHARING ECONOMY. WE PROVE THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND THE TRANSPARENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ARE MAJOR FACTORS IN THE FORMAL ENVIRONMENT THAT AFFECT THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. THE INFORMAL ENVIRONMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE LEVEL OF TRUST AND SOCIAL CONTACTS IN THE COUNTRY, EXPRESSED THROUGH SOCIAL CAPITAL. THE NOVELTY OF OUR FINDINGS CONSISTS IN DETERMINING THE NATURE OF INFLUENCE OF THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SHARING ECONOMY. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS LIES IN THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE IDENTIFIED PATTERNS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS AND THE SHARING ECONOMY
7	THE FEBRUARY 2020 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION MARKED A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT FOR SLOVAKIA AFTER YEARS OF PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION WITH ENDEMIC CORRUPTION, POLITICAL MISMANAGEMENT, AND UNACCOUNTABLE LEADERSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLITICAL HEGEMONY OF SMER-SD AND ITS LEADER ROBERT FICO. THE RESOUNDING VICTORY OF THE ORDINARY PEOPLE AND INDEPENDENT PERSONALITIES PARTY OFFERS THE COUNTRY AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS WITH SLOVAKIA'S POLITICAL CULTURE OF CORRUPTION AND OLIGARCHISM, BUT ALSO TO STRENGTHEN DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO INTERNATIONAL EXPECTATIONS, THE ELECTORAL DEMOGRAPHIC THAT CHOSE ZUZANA CAPUTOVA AS SLOVAKIA'S NEW PRESIDENT IN 2019 FAILED TO SECURE ENOUGH VOTES TO PLACE ANY LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN PARLIAMENT, LEAVING THE CURRENT LEGISLATURE DOMINATED BY A COLLECTION OF CONSERVATIVE, POPULIST, AND EUROSCEPTIC PARTIES. WHILE SEEN BY SOME ANALYSTS AS A SETBACK, THE PROGNOSIS FOR SLOVAKIAN POLITICS APPEARS RATHER OPTIMISTIC. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE OUTCOMES OF THE FEBRUARY ELECTION AND NOTES A CONTINUED PATTERN OF POLITICAL ENTREPRENEURIALISM WHERE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PARTIES TEND TO BE THOSE THAT PROMOTE BROAD-BASED ISSUES OF POLICY INSTEAD OF ANY PARTICULAR IDEOLOGY, CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL. SLOVAKIAN POLITICS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF NATIONALIST AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, BUT ACTUAL POLICY HAS BEEN DIRECTED BY OPPORTUNISTS INSTEAD OF IDEOLOGUES. THIS HAS ENABLED THESE LARGER ENTREPRENEURIAL PARTIES TO ADOPT CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS INTO THEIR PROGRAMMES FOR ELECTORAL ADVANTAGE INSTEAD OF FROM ACTUAL CONVICTION. THIS LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL PARTIES MIGHT GRAVITATE TOWARDS MORE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC AND EVEN PROGRESSIVE POLICIES SHOULD ADVANTAGEOUS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE IN THE FUTURE. GIVEN THE CURRENT EFFORTS BY SLOVAKIAN POLITICAL ACTORS TO BREAK WITH PAST PATTERNS OF OLIGARCHISM, COUPLED WITH THE DISCREDITING OF ENTRENCHED POLITICAL ELITISM AND THE VISIBLE-YET-MANAGEABLE THREATS FROM SLOVAKIA'S FAR RIGHT, SUCH OUTCOMES ARE INCREASINGLY LIKELY.
8	THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE FOREST CRIMES COMMITTED IN KASTAMONU REGIONAL DIRECTORATE OF FORESTRY (KRDF), WHERE FOREST AREAS ARE DENSE, EXAMINED THE INFLUENCES OF LAW AND PUBLIC AWARENESS ON CHANGES IN CRIME RATES. NOWADAYS, AS THE BENEFITS OF THE FORESTS ARE GAINING IMPORTANCE, EFFORTS TO ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PROTECTION OF FORESTS AND TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ON THE ISSUE HAVE BEEN INCREASING. IN THIS STUDY, FIRST THE CONCEPTS OF CRIME AND FOREST CRIME WERE EXAMINED, FOLLOWED BY AN EVALUATION OF TYPES OF FOREST CRIMES AND THE MEASURES TAKEN IN IN RESPONSE. AFTERWARDS, A QUESTIONNAIRE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PEOPLE LIVING IN THE VILLAGES AFFILIATED WITH THE KRDF, THE SAMPLE FIELD, WITH THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FOREST CRIMES AND PENALTIES, AND WHETHER THIS AWARENESS DECREASED THE CRIME RATES. USING THE QUESTIONNAIRE, PUBLIC AWARENESS OF FOREST CRIMES AND PENALTIES WERE INVESTIGATED AS WELL AS THE REASONS THAT LEAD TO COMMITTING SUCH CRIMES. IN ADDITION, THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOCIETY ON THE FOREST WAS ALSO ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE, IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE CRIME RATES AND TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW. IF THE PUBLIC WAS AWARE OF BOTH THE FOREST CRIMES AND PENALTIES SUFFICIENTLY, THE CRIME RATES WERE OFTEN LOWER IN THE AREA BECAUSE RESIDENTS OBEYED THE RULES. THEREFORE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW IS HIGH. THIS IS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF REDUCING FOREST CRIME RATES, PRESERVING FOREST ASSETS, SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY, AND TRANSFERRING IT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. THUS, THE LEGAL RULES MEET THESE OBJECTIVES. HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE THE CRIME RATE WAS HIGH EVEN THOUGH THE PUBLIC AWARENESS ON FOREST CRIMES IS ADEQUATE, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAW IS LOW, AND OTHER MEASURES SHALL WILL HAVE TO BE ADOPTED.
9	AGRICULTURAL LAND PAWNING IS NOT A NEW PHENOMENON TO THE TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES (MASYARAKAT ADAT) IN INDONESIA, ESPECIALLY THE MATRILINEAL MINANGKABAU PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THEIR AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR ECONOMIC TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON THE NATIONAL LAW, CUSTOMARY LAW (REFERRED TO AS ADAT LAW HEREAFTER) IS TO PREVAIL OVER AGRARIAN ISSUES IN INDONESIA. BUT EVEN SO, AGRARIAN ISSUES REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NATIONAL LAW. THIS STUDY DISCUSSES THE MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND PAWNING IN THE MATRILINEAL MINANGKABAU SOCIETY ACCORDING TO NATIONAL, ADAT, AND ISLAMIC LAWS. DESPITE ITS POPULARITY, THE ADAT LAW APPROACH IN DEALING WITH LAND ISSUES, ESPECIALLY AGRICULTURAL LAND PAWNING, HAS NOT BEEN WELL ACCOMMODATED UNDER NATIONAL LAW. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW AGRICULTURAL LAND PAWNING IS REGULATED IN INDONESIA, WITH A FOCUS ON THE MINANGKABAU SOCIETY IN WEST SUMATRA. THIS PAPER DOES NOT SEEK TO PROMOTE ONE LEGAL SYSTEM OVER ANOTHER, BUT INSTEAD, IT INTENDS TO PROMOTE LEGAL CERTAINTY IN AGRICULTURAL LAND PAWNING IN WEST SUMATRA. TO SHOW HOW THE LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION AND CONFLICT, THIS STUDY RELIES ON THE CONTRADICTING VERDICTS OF AN AGRARIAN CONFLICT CASE FROM LOWER COURTS TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN NATIONAL AGRARIAN LAWS, MINANGKABAU ADAT LAW AND WEST SUMATRA LOCAL REGULATION NO. 16/2008 ON COMMUNAL LAND TENURE CAUSES CONFUSION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THE JUDICIARY. LEGAL CERTAINTY IS CRUCIAL TO STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IN INDONESIA, AND THE CONFLICTING INTERPRETATIONS OF AGRARIAN LAWS BELITTLE THIS CONCEPT. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH LEGAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING AGRARIAN LAW IN WEST SUMATRA, AND THROUGHOUT INDONESIA, IS TO PROMOTE A STRONGER AND MORE JUST DECENTRALIZATION, WHICH IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THE COUNTRY FACES THE QUESTION OF LEGAL UNIFICATION. THE SUGGESTED DECENTRALIZATION EFFORT WOULD LEAVE LOCAL ISSUES TO THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL LEGISLATIONS.
10	THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE EVOLUTION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GPU-OGPU AND PROSECUTORS IN THE OMSK-IRTYSH REGION. IT WAS SHOWN THAT AT THE END OF 1922 TO THE MIDDLE OF 1927, PROSECUTORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR MANDATE SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED OUT THE STATE CONTROL OVER ACTIVITIES OF THE OGPU AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH SOVIET LEGISLATION THEREBY PERFORMING IN PRACTICE THE IDEA OF "REVOLUTIONARY LEGALITY". THE CHARACTER OF RELATIONS PROSECUTORS AND OGPU WAS CHANGED IN 1927. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE "PARYGIN CASE". SECURITY OFFICERS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL PARTY-STATE ELITE BEGAN TO IGNORE THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S SUPERVISION, THIS DISCREDITING THE PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES. BY THE BEGINNING OF 1928 IN OMSK IRTYSH REGION PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES HAD LOST INFLUENCE AND DID NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE PARTY APPARATUS. WITH REGARD TO CITIZENS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE OGPU, PROSECUTORS COULD NOT FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL. SINCE THE LATE 1920S, THE NEED FOR RULING PARTY IN CONDUCT OF THE OGPU'S REPRESSIVE POLICY AGAINST WIDE SOCIAL GROUPS LED TO THE FACT THAT IS NOT PROSECUTORS WHO OVERSAW THE OGPU, BUT THE OGPU WHICH, IN SPITE OF THE LEGISLATION, CONDUCTED SURVEILLANCE OF THE PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES AND REPORTED ITS RESULTS TO THE PARTY LEADERSHIP. AT THAT TIME THE OGPU WAS NOT SUPERVISED BY PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES, ON THE CONTRARY, PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES BEGAN TO BE SUPERVISED BY THE OGPU DESPITE SOVIET LAW. SUCH PRACTICES DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1920S ARE EVIDENCE OF APPROVAL IN SOVIET SOCIETY THE PRIMACY OF "REVOLUTIONARY EXPEDIENCY", WHICH COMES FROM THE OGPU, OVER "REVOLUTIONARY LEGALITY", WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES TOGETHER WITH THE COURTS. IT BECAME THE MOST IMPORTANT PRECONDITION FOR THE SPOILING OF THE NEP, COLLECTIVIZATION AND LARGE-SCALE POLITICAL REPRESSION.
11	PURPOSE THE FIRST PRISON SYSTEM CASE IN ZIMBABWE WAS NOTIFIED IN JULY 2020 SHORTLY AFTER STATE DECLARATION OF DISASTER. A LEGAL-REALIST ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED OF THE ZIMBABWEAN CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM RESPONSE TO COVID-19 DURING STATE DISASTER MEASURES, WITH A FOCUS ON ASSESSING RIGHT TO HEALTH, INFECTIOUS DISEASE MITIGATION AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH MINIMUM STATE OBLIGATIONS COMPLIED WITH HUMAN AND HEALTH RIGHTS STANDARDS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE ZIMBABWEAN CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM OPERATIONS DURING COVID-19 DISASTER MEASURES ARE SCRUTINIZED USING A RANGE OF INTERNATIONAL, AFRICAN AND DOMESTIC HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS IN RELATION TO THE RIGHT TO HEALTH OF PRISONERS. THIS STUDY FOCUSED PARTICULARLY ON STANDARDS OF CARE, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF DETENTION AND RIGHT OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. FINDINGS SYSTEMIC POOR STANDARDS OF DETENTION ARE OBSERVED, WHERE PRISONERS EXPERIENCE POWER OUTAGES, WATER SHORTAGES AND A LACK OF ACCESS TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND WATER FOR ABLUTION PURPOSES, A SEVERE LACK OF SAFE SPACE AND ADEQUATE VENTILATION, POOR QUALITY FOOD AND MALNUTRITION AND A LACK OF SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF FOOD, MEDICINES, CLOTHING AND BEDDING. WHILST ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE OF PRISONERS IN ZIMBABWE HAS GREATLY IMPROVED IN RECENT TIMES, THE STANDARD OF CARE WAS SEVERELY STRETCHED DURING COVID-19 DUE TO LACK OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCING AND RELIANCE ON NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION AND FAITH-BASED ORGANISATIONS TO SUPPORT DEMAND FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, DISINFECTION PRODUCTS AND MEDICINES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE PRISON CONDITIONS IN ZIMBABWE ARE CONDUCIVE TO CHRONIC ILL HEALTH AND THE SPREAD OF MANY TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES, NOT LIMITED TO COVID-19. THE DEVELOPED LEGAL-REALIST ACCOUNT CONSIDERS WHETHER ZIMBABWE HAD A CULTURE OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW PERTINENT TO HUMAN AND HEALTH RIGHTS OF THOSE DETAINED DURING COVID-19 DISASTER MEASURES, AND WHETHER MINIMUM STANDARDS OF CARE WERE UPHELD.
12	ACHIEVING ECONOMIC GROWTH IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN MOSTLY OF EVERY COUNTRY TO ENHANCE LIVING STANDARD; HOWEVER, AN INCREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES MAY HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IS ALSO CONSIDERED A DRIVER OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE IT AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF ENVIRONMENT. THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS CAN BE USEFUL TO ENHANCE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOW WHICH CAN IN TURN INCREASE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SAFEGUARD ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. BASED ON THE ONGOING DEBATE, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS WHETHER THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS PLAYS ANY ROLE IN FDI INFLOW AND IN ENHANCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN FDI INFLOWS AND CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION IN THE GLOBAL PANEL, 107 WORLD DEVELOPING, AND 39 BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD OF 2002-2019. BY USING BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC PANEL MODELS, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ARE IMPORTANT FOR FDI INFLOWS, BUT THIS IMPACT VARIES IN DIFFERENT PANELS. OVERALL, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY HAS A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INFLOW, WHILE ENERGY USE REDUCES IT IN ALL PANELS. ECONOMIC GROWTH POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON EMISSION, WHILE THE SQUARE OF GDP EVIDENCES THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE. FDI AND TRADE INCREASE GLOBAL AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' EMISSIONS, WHILE REDUCING EMISSION IN BELT AND ROAD COUNTRIES. INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ALONG INDIVIDUAL INDICATORS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND REGULATORY QUALITY ARE FOUND TO BE POOR GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN ALL PANELS, WHILE VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE WEAK INDICATORS IN BELT AND ROAD COUNTRIES; HOWEVER, THE INTERACTION TERM PROVES THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS IS REGULATED BY FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND FDI IN CARBON EMISSION REDUCTION IN ALL PANELS. THIS STUDY HAS CONSIDERABLE POLICY SIGNIFICANCE FOR COUNTRIES TO CARRY OUT STRONG POLICY REFORMS TO INCREASE GREEN FDI AND IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY.
13	THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS UNUSUALLY AGGRESSIVE IN USING AN OBSCURE SET OF TOOLS TO UNDO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S REGULATORY LEGACY: CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT DISAPPROVALS, REQUESTS THAT COURTS HOLD IN ABEYANCE PENDING CASES CHALLENGING OBAMA-ERA REGULATIONS, AND SUSPENSIONS OF FINAL REGULATIONS. THESE ACTIONS COULD BE SEEN AS PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NORM-BREAKING APPROACH TO REGULATORY POLICY, UNDER WHICH IT ALSO PROVIDED SHODDY JUSTIFICATIONS FOR ITS ACTIONS, IGNORED STATUTORY COMMANDS, AND FAILED TO COMPLY WITH PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL ASSUMPTION THAT THE NORM-BREAKING WAS A RESULT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE WHEN A NEW ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THIS ASSUMPTION, SHOWING THAT THE TRUMP-ERA TOOLKIT ON ROLLBACKS HAS NOW ALSO BEEN USED AGGRESSIVELY-IN SOME CASES MORE AGGRESSIVELY-BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. ACTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AS AN ABERRATION FOUR YEARS AGO SHOULD NOW BE REGARDED AS INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. IN A 2019 ARTICLE DESCRIBING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S AGGRESSIVE ROLLBACK TOOLS, WE PREDICTED THAT THE NATURE OF THE PRESIDENCY WOULD CHANGE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS AS A RESULT. A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT MUCH REGULATORY POLICY THAT IS DURABLE. AND TO DO SO, A PRESIDENT HAS A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD DURING WHICH REGULATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE PROTECTED FROM QUICK UNDOING BY A SUCCESSOR OF THE OPPOSITE PARTY, FROM ROUGHLY THREE-AND-A-HALF YEARS TO ABOUT TWO YEARS. THE IMPACT OF THIS TREND IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE, DURING THE CURRENT ERA OF CONGRESSIONAL GRIDLOCK, PRESIDENTS RELY ON REGULATIONS AS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH TO IMPLEMENT THEIR DOMESTIC POLICY PROGRAMS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SHOWING THAT THESE CHANGES ARE HERE TO STAY.
14	INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS IMPEDE FIRMS' OPEN INNOVATION. THEY HAVE BEEN A CHALLENGE, OBSTRUCTING GROWTH AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH ON OPEN INNOVATION HAS SHOWN THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS ESSENTIALLY AFFECTS INNOVATION IN FIRMS. HENCE, PRIOR RESEARCH HAS MADE EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS INTO OPEN INNOVATION ANALYSIS. WE CAN USE A SERIES OF ANALYSES TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION, THE TAX SYSTEM, AND OTHER INDICATORS ON FIRM INNOVATION PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, SUCH AS COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, REPRESENT A SPECIFIC GROUP OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN PERCEIVED AS THOSE MOSTLY DEFICIENT IN THE RULE OF LAW, WITH POOR REGULATORY QUALITY AND A GREAT DEAL OF CORRUPTION. IN THESE COUNTRIES, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO SEE A LOWER NUMBER OF STUDIES, AS THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN QUALITY DATA TO PERFORM EMPIRICAL ANALYSES CAN OFTEN LIMIT RESEARCHERS. NEVERTHELESS, EMPLOYING DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK'S 2019 ENTERPRISE SURVEY, THIS RESEARCH AIMED AT EXPLORING THE DETERMINANTS OF SUSTAINABLE OPEN INNOVATION AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FIRMS' CAPACITY UTILIZATION AND PROCESS INNOVATION THROUGH A PLS STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL ANALYSIS. OUR RESEARCH SHOWED INTERESTING FINDINGS, SUCH AS THE FACT THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS FIRMS' USE OF OI INSTRUMENTS AND CAPACITY UTILIZATION. THIS RESEARCH ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE NOVELTY OF THE ANALYSIS OF CAPACITY UTILIZATION IN AN OPEN INNOVATION ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESES THAT LOW INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS FIRMS' IMPLEMENTATION OF INBOUND OPEN INNOVATION INSTRUMENTS, AND THAT THERE IS A STRONG AND POSITIVE EFFECT OF LOW INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY ON FIRMS' CAPACITY UTILIZATION. IN ADDITION, WE CONFIRM THE PREMISE THAT FIRMS' IMPLEMENTATION OF INBOUND OPEN INNOVATION INSTRUMENTS HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON FIRMS' PROCESS INNOVATION.
15	IN A WORLD IN WHICH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SYSTEMS ARE INCREASINGLY SHAPING OUR ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS OUR ACCESS TO AND EXCLUSION FROM OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE SOME FORM OF AI OVERSIGHT. SUCH OVERSIGHT WILL HELP TO MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW, TO PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES. NEVERTHELESS, ACHIEVING AI OVERSIGHT IS CHALLENGING DUE TO THE DYNAMIC AND OPAQUE NATURE OF SUCH SYSTEMS. RECENTLY, IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR AI SYSTEMS, THE PROPOSED US ALGORITHMIC ACCOUNTABILITY ACT INTRODUCED MANDATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR PRIVATE ENTITIES THAT DEPLOY AUTOMATED DECISION -MAKING SYSTEMS. IMPACT ASSESSMENT AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE OVERSIGHT WAS LIKEWISE RECENTLY ADOPTED UNDER THE EU'S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE INITIATIVES MARK THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN AI OVERSIGHT POLICY. IN THIS PAPER, WE QUESTION THE MERITS OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT AS A TOOL FOR PROMOTING OVERSIGHT OF AI SYSTEMS. USING THE CASE OF AI SYSTEMS OF CONTENT MODERATION, WE HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THIS OVERSIGHT TOOL AND PROPOSE HOW TO IMPROVE IT. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARGUE THAT EVEN AN IMPROVED IMPACT ASSESSMENT DOES NOT FIT EQUALLY WITH THE OVERSIGHT CHALLENGE RAISED BY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OF AI. ESPECIALLY, IMPACT ASSESSMENTS MIGHT BE INSUFFICIENT TO OVERSEE AI SYSTEMS THAT ARE DEPLOYED TO ACHIEVE PURPOSES THAT COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS PUBLIC, SUCH AS MAKING OUR ONLINE PUBLIC SPHERE SAFER. MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF AI SYSTEMS THAT IMPOSE COSTS ON SOCIETY AS A WHOLE, LIKE AI SYSTEMS OF CONTENT MODERATION, CANNOT BE PURSUED BY MECHANISMS OF SELF -ASSESSMENT ALONE. THEREFORE, AS WE SUGGEST IN THIS PAPER, SUCH SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ADDITIONALLY SUBJECTED TO OBJECTIVE MECHANISMS OF EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT.
16	BUILDING A RULE-OF-LAW STATE REQUIRES ESTABLISHING RATIONAL PRIORITIES FOR LEGAL PROTECTION. HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HOLD A CENTER PLACE IN THE CRIMINAL LAW POLICY AS OBJECTS OF PROTECTION AGAINST CRIMINAL INFRINGEMENTS. MURDER IS ONE OF SUCH HARMFUL INFRINGEMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS SOMETIMES A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE DEGREE OF PUBLIC DANGER OF ITS DIFFERENT VARIETIES. RUSSIAN CRIMINAL LAW POLICY IS AIMED AT A FURTHER HUMANIZATION AND HARMONIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW, WHICH MAKES IT NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE REGULATION OF MERCY KILLINGS. A KILLING COMMITTED OUT OF MERCY, AT THE VICTIM'S REQUEST, TO RELIEF PAIN AND UNBEARABLE SUFFERING CAUSED BY A SEVERE INCURABLE ILLNESS IS NOT REGULATED BY RUSSIAN LEGISLATION. THIS TYPE OF KILLINGS IS CURRENTLY QUALIFIED BY RUSSIAN LAW ENFORCERS UNDER CLAUSE "B", PART 2, ART. 105 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THUS, RUSSIAN LEGISLATION VIEWS THIS TYPE OF KILLING AS A QUALIFIED CRIME WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, IS NOT QUITE CORRECT. THE ARTICLE CITES INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE THAT CATEGORIZES MERCY KILLING AS A PRIVILEGED TYPE OF CRIME. BESIDES, SOME THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ARTICLE ARE ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES FROM RUSSIAN COURT PRACTICE ON THIS TYPE OF KILLING. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON BOTH RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN WORKS IN THE SPHERE OF CRIMINAL LAW. IT DISCUSSES SOME DISPUTED ASPECTS OF DELINEATING A MERCY KILLING AND OFFENCES WITH SIMILAR CORPUS DELICTI. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE NECESSITY TO LEGALLY FIX THE SPECIFIC OFFENCE OF MERCY KILLING, AND TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO INCLUDE THIS OFFENCE. A DRAFT ARTICLE OF THE CC OF THE RF REGULATING MERCY KILLING IS PRESENTED. THE SUGGESTED AND SUBSTANTIATED DIRECTIONS OF AMENDING RUSSIAN CRIMINAL LEGISLATION COULD BE USED IN THE LAWMAKING PROCESS FOR THE FUTURE IMPROVEMENT OF CRIMINAL LEGISLATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AND IN TEACHING CRIMINAL LAW DISCIPLINES.
17	THE LINK BETWEEN SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN WIDELY DEBATED IN RECENT YEARS. NEW COOPERATION INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION EMERGENCY TRUST FUND FOR AFRICA HAVE FOCUSED ON THE USE OF COOPERATION MECHANISMS FOR PURPOSES THAT DIFFER FROM THE CLASSIC OBJECTIVES OF DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION SUCH AS THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY OR THOSE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THAT FACT HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL SITUATION IN POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC FIELD AND AMONG THE COOPERATION EXPERTS'. THIS DOCUMENT PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE LINKS BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY. WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK, IT IS WORTH HIGHLIGHTING HOW, FROM A GENERAL APPROACH, PREVENTING VIOLENT EXTREMISM (PVE) AND TERRORISM CAN BE TACKLED TANGENTIALLY THROUGH SOME GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES SUCH AS CONFLICT PREVENTION OR THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE POSITION OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS ON THIS ISSUE, INCLUDING THE INITIATIVES OF THE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE COMMITTEE (DAC), THE INSTITUTION WHICH, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD), MONITORS AND EVALUATES THE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES OF ITS MEMBER COUNTRIES, AND OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REFLECT FURTHER ON POSSIBLE WAYS OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM AND RADICALISATION AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION. IN ADDITION, EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE INCORPORATED INTERVENTIONS IN THIS AREA AS PART OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT POLICY, SUCH AS DENMARK, THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SWEDEN. IN CONCLUSION, IT ANALYSES SPAIN'S POSITION IN THIS REGARD, SPECIFICALLY FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL OF THE V MASTER PLAN FOR SPANISH COOPERATION 2018-2021. THE STUDY OF THE PRIORITIZED GOALS AND THE LINES OF ACTION INCLUDED IN THE MASTER PLAN WILL ALLOW ASSESSING WHETHER TERRORISM PREVENTION CAN BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION PLANNING AND IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR ACTION THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MINIMIZING FAVOURABLE CONTEXTS FOR RADICALIZATION AND TERRORISM.
18	IT IS NOT A SECRET THAT VIRTUAL SPACE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS THE SETTING IN WHICH DAILY RUN WAS ONLY THINKABLE ACTS PERFORM THEM IN THE WORLD CAN BE CALLED REAL. THUS, IN THE VIRTUAL SPACE WE ENTER TODAY FROM A LIBRARY TO CONSULT TEXTS, DOWNLOAD MUSIC, MAKE PHONE CALLS, EXCHANGE INFORMATION, TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES. THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS WHICH SHOWS THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY VIRTUAL POLIS IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY, COMFORT AND ABOVE ALL IN TERMS OF ACCELERATING TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED, SINCE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHICH INVOLVED A DELAY IN THE REALIZATION OF CERTAIN ACTS, IT IS FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE SCENARIO UNDER ANALYSIS. THEREFORE, IT IS AT LEAST LEGAL SCIENCE MUST BECOME A PART OF VIRTUAL SPACE, WITH THE OBJECT AND PURPOSE OF PROVIDING SECURITY AND CERTAINTY TO THE PARTIES AS TO THE ACTS THAT RUN, ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ERA OF DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT, IF YOU WILL, THE EMERGING INFORMATION SOCIETY CAN NOT BE AN ANARCHIC SPACE OF THE RULE OF LAW OF THE JUNGLE, BUT ON THE CONTRARY, REQUIRES A REGULATION BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF E-BUSINESS, PRO CONVENIENT WAY TO REGULATE IT, WITHOUT IT BEING ESTABLISHED AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, ADDRESSING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS MAY BE PRESENT IN NETWORK TRAFFIC, IT IS AT LEAST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK, WHICH IS WHY I FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MANIFESTATION OF THE WILL OF THE PARTIES IN ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, CONVINCED THAT SUCH A TOPIC IS ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THOSE INVOLVED IN THIS SPACE. IT IS JUST THE STATEMENT MADE CLEAR, WHENEVER THE PROFESSOR BOSS ANALYZES IN SOME PAPERS, E-COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS OVER NETWORKS DEMAND THE NEED TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES MAKING UP THE NETWORK CONTRACT ITER.
19	THE TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES TO CHINA WILL INCREASINGLY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO DEVELOPED NATIONS AS THE DEMAND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES INCREASES IN CHINA. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO CHINA REVEALED A RANGE OF WELL RECOGNIZED AND COMMONLY KNOWN CONSTRAINTS TO TRANSFERRING TECHNOLOGIES TO CHINA. THERE WERE GAPS IN THE LITERATURE IN RELATION TO THE CONCERNS THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE REGARDING TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO CHINA, AS THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE TRANSFER IN ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES TO CHINA. A SURVEY OF THE NON-TRADE BARRIERS AND THEIR PRACTICAL IMPACT ON THE TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES AND GOODS AND SERVICES TO CHINA, FOCUSING ON AUSTRALIAN SUPPLIERS, WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS. THE SURVEY, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED FROM BARRIERS TO TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ALREADY DESCRIBED IN THE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ADDRESSING THE WIDER ISSUES OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO CHINA, TARGETED ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS BUT ALSO INCLUDED OTHER PROFESSIONALS WITH INTERESTS IN TRANSFERRING ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES TO CHINA. FROM THE SURVEY, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BARRIERS TO TRANSFERRING ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICE TO CHINA WERE IDENTIFIED, AND THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO LIMIT AUSTRALIAN VENDORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES IN THEIR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS TO CHINA WERE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP), LIMITATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, FRAGMENTATION AND BUREAUCRACY OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP (OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDERS IN CHINA). EXAMPLES OF AUSTRALIAN EXPERIENCE WERE ALSO EXAMINED, WHICH CONFIRMED THESE BARRIERS TO PROVIDING THE NEEDED TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION TO MANAGE CHINA'S INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT THE BARRIERS IDENTIFIED DO NOT APPEAR TO BE UNIQUE TO TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOODS AND SERVICES BUT RATHER GENERIC TO THE TRANSFER AND ADOPTION OF AUSTRALIAN TECHNOLOGY INTO CHINA.

20	ONE OF THE EU'S KEY FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES IS TO PROMOTE THE VALUES ENSHRINED IN ITS TREATIES, SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE EU'S SELF-CONCEPTION OF BEING A "RULE MAKER" RATHER THAN A "RULE TAKER" IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, HOWEVER, IS INCREASINGLY CONTESTED BOTH BY INTERNAL (E.G., DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING OR A GENERAL TENDENCY TOWARDS NATIONALIST POLITICS) AS WELL AS EXTERNAL CHALLENGES (E.G., THE RETURN OF BILATERALISM OR THE RISE OF NEW ACTORS). CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) IS OFTEN UNDERSTOOD AS THE MOST SERIOUS OPPOSITION ON THE EXTERNAL SIDE TO THE EU'S MODEL OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, IN THAT IT PROMOTES A PRAGMATIC INSTEAD OF A NORM-BASED APPROACH, AT LEAST AT FIRST GLANCE. THE CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY MODEL THAT THE BRI REFLECTS, EXPLICITLY FAVOURS OPEN MEMBERSHIP, FLEXIBILITY AND ECONOMIC GAINS OVER MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS AND NORM-BASED ACTION. BY DRAWING ON ORIGINAL INTERVIEWS AND ANALYSING CENTRAL POLICY DOCUMENTS, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE JUXTAPOSITION OF NORMATIVITY AND PRAGMATISM HAS SHAPED THE POLITICAL AND ACADEMIC DISCOURSE ON THE EU'S FOREIGN POLICY AND IDEA OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. IT ARGUES THAT THIS DUALITY OF NORMATIVITY VERSUS PRAGMATISM IS MISLEADING BECAUSE IT OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT THE EU AND CHINA BOTH (A) CONSTITUTE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A CERTAIN PRACTICE AND (B) ARE ROOTED IN PRACTICE. DRAWING ON KAGAN'S CULTURAL THESIS OF FOREIGN POLICY, IT QUESTIONS THE REAL MEANING OF THIS JUXTAPOSITION AND APPLIES A PRACTICE-BASED READING TO THE EU'S AND CHINA'S MODES OF FOREIGN POLICY MAKING. THE ARTICLE FURTHER SHOWS THAT SCRUTINISING FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH THE PRISM OF PRACTICE CAN PROVIDE A MORE CONTEXT-SENSITIVE AND ENCOMPASSING UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EU AND CHINA CONSTRUCT THEIR FOREIGN POLICIES AS WELL AS OF POSSIBLE CONFLICTS THAT ARISE FROM THEM.
21	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE PROBLEMS OF LEGAL POLICY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN AIMED AT COUNTERACTING TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM. THE GOAL OF RESEARCH IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL MECHANISMS OF PREVENTING TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IN MODERN KAZAKH SOCIETY, THE ANALYSIS OF KEY REASONS BEHIND THE SPREAD OF EXTREMIST ATTITUDES AMONG SOME BELIEVERS, THE STUDY OF KEY FACTORS BEHIND THE EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE DIALECTIC METHOD FREED FROM MATERIALISTIC OR IDEALISTIC MONISM AND GROUNDED IN PLURALISTIC, MULTI-LINEAR INTERDEPENDENCE OF ALL POLITICAL AND LEGAL PHENOMENA. THE AUTHORS USED FORMAL-LEGAL AND COMPARATIVE-LEGAL METHODS. THEY RESEARCHED THE STATE PROGRAM OF COUNTERACTING RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM IN THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN IN 2018-2022, WHICH FORESEES PREDOMINANTLY PREVENTIVE MEASURES. THE KEY TASK OF ENSURING STATE SECURITY IN A RULE-OF-LAW STATE WITH A WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN IS, MAINLY CONSISTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESSFUL ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL MECHANISMS OF GOVERNANCE. IN THE MODERN WORLD, RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL EXTREMISM REMAINS A PHENOMENON THAT DESTROYS THE BASIS OF STATE POWER AND THE SYSTEM OF STATE GOVERNANCE, INSTIGATES HATRED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS, AND CONTRADICTS THE STANDARDS OF MORALITY AND PUBLIC BEHAVIOR. TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM ARE A REAL THREAT TO STABILITY NOT ONLY FOR THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN, BUT FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THE IMPROVEMENT OF BASIC ASPECTS IN THE CRIMINAL SPHERE, INCLUDING THE PREVENTION OF SPECIFIC TERRORISM-RELATED CRIMES, REMAINS VERY TOPICAL TODAY. THE CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMINAL LAW NORMS CONNECTED WITH COUNTERACTING TERRORISM AND RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF KEY INDICATORS OF CRIMINAL POLICY AND FUNDAMENTAL CRIMINAL LAW INSTITUTES, WHOSE DESCRIPTION CONSTITUTES THE MAIN BODY OF THIS ARTICLE.
22	THE RIGHT TO DEFENCE IS A VERY IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE SOVIET OCCUPATION ZONE OF GERMANY, LATER THE GDR, THE LEGAL PROFESSION UNDERWENT A TRANSFORMATION. INDIVIDUAL DEFENCE FOR DEFENDANTS WAS NOT TO BE TOTALLY ABANDONED, BUT IT WAS MEANT TO BE SUBORDINATED TO THE INTEREST OF THE SOCIALIST STATE. THE ACADEMIC STUDY, WHICH HAS SERVED AS THE BASIS FOR THIS ARTICLE, SHOWS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN EAST GERMANY. DUE TO THE ANALYSIS OF A LARGE NUMBER (ABOUT 1,800) OF LEGAL PROCEDURES THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN BERLIN BY THE MINISTRY FOR STATE SECURITY (MFS), THE COURSE OF POLITICAL TRIALS AND THE CONDUCT OF ADVOCATES IN SUCH TRIALS HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR THE FIRST TIME. CONTRARY TO THE SHOW TRIALS OF THE 1950S, A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE FOR THE HONECKER ERA WAS A SHORT SECRET TRIAL. THE TRIAL CULTURE CLEARLY DETERIORATED, THOUGH A REVERSE TREND COULD BE OBSERVED SINCE THE MID-1980S. THE RESEARCH AIM IS TO ANALYZE HOW IT HAPPENED. THE RECRUITMENT OF ADVOCATES, THEIR ORGANISATION IN DISTRICT BAR ASSOCIATIONS, THEIR EDUCATION AND DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WERE NOT INSIGNIFICANT. THE ROLE OF THE MFS IN EXERTING CONTROL OVER ADVOCATES AND POLITICAL TRIALS HAS ALSO BEEN STUDIED. EVEN IF THERE WERE DRASTIC CASES OF INTERFERENCE IN THE PROCEEDINGS BY THE MFS ALSO THROUGH SECRET COLLABORATORS - UNTIL NOW, THE CONTROL OF THE JUDICIARY BY THE SAID MINISTRY IN THE LATE GDR WAS RATHER OVERESTIMATED. WHAT WAS MORE INFLUENTIAL WERE THE SO-CALLED "STEERING MEETINGS" THESE ASSEMBLIES WHICH WERE SECRET AND ARE STILL UNDERESTIMATED CONTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THE COURSE OF THE PROCEDURES WAS QUITE UNIFORM AND CONFORMED TO THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE SOCIALIST UNITY PARTY OF GERMANY (SED).
23	SOUTH AFRICA HAS TAKEN CENTRE STAGE IN MOST ACCOUNTS OF THE SYNERGISTIC POTENTIAL OF LAW AND POLITICS: IT IS SEEN TO BE A CASE WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE MADE REAL, WITH THE FAVOURABLE COMBINATION OF INSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS. AMONG THESE CONDITIONS, FROM A FEMINIST PERSPECTIVE, ARE THE INCLUSION OF EQUALITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION, HIGH LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN PARLIAMENT AND THE BUREAUCRACY, AND A STRONG AND FREE CIVIL SOCIETY. THE COUNTRY IS OFTEN INVOKED, IN COMPARATIVE SOCIAL SCIENCE, AS AN EXAMPLE OF A DEMOCRATIC AND RELATIVELY PEACEFUL TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIANISM, IN WHICH THE BREAKDOWN OF INSTITUTIONS WAS AVOIDED; RATHER, IT IS SEEN AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTIONAL REDIRECTION FROM SUPPORTING AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE TO ADVANCING A DEMOCRATIC PROJECT. HOWEVER, THE CONSTITUTION IS COMING UNDER INCREASING ATTACK. IT IS NOT ONLY CONSERVATIVE FORCES THAT SEEK TO UNDERMINE RIGHTS IN THE NAME OF CULTURE, OR WEALTHY ELITES CONCERNED ABOUT DEFENDING THEIR RIGHTS TO PROPERTY THROUGH RULE OF LAW AND OPPOSING HIGH TAXATION, THAT ARE CRITICAL. IT IS ALSO CHALLENGED BY RADICAL VOICES THAT AIM AT CREATING A SOCIETY FREE OF OPPRESSION. FOR THE LATTER ACTORS, THE CONSTITUTION IS LESS A TOOL OF CHANGE AND MORE AN EXAMPLE OF COLONIALITY, OR THE IMPOSITION OF A WESTERN DISCOURSE ON AFRICA. THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT DECOLONISING POLITICAL PROJECTS REQUIRE MORE CAREFUL ENGAGEMENT, AS THE PROJECT OF DECOLONIALITY IS ONE THAT IS IN MANY RESPECTS ALLIED TO THE PROJECT OF FEMINISM, WHOSE OWN HISTORY REQUIRED THE DISABLING OF THE INVISIBILISED MALE NORM ON WHICH MUCH LEGAL AND POLITICAL THEORY WAS FOUNDED. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE DECOLONIAL CRITIQUE BY SHOWING THE RADICAL ROOTS OF THE EQUALITY CLAUSE IN A CENTURY-LONG HISTORY OF STRUGGLES BY BLACK WOMEN.
24	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS STATE-LEGAL VIEWS OF THE RUSSIAN THINKER I.A. ILYIN AND AIMS AT IDENTIFYING THEIR THEORETICAL POTENTIAL AND ROLE IN THE RUSSIAN HISTORY OF SOCIOLOGY. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE WORKS OF ILYIN AND RESEARCHERS OF HIS LEGACY. THE RELEVANCE OF SUCH A STUDY IS DETERMINED, ON THE ONE HAND, BY ILYIN'S SPECIFIC OUTLOOK THAT IN MANY RESPECTS CAN EXPLAIN THE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIETY AT THE TURN OF THE 21ST CENTURY; ON THE OTHER HAND, BY THE SOCIOLOGICAL NEED TO SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC RUSSIAN SOLUTIONS. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS CONSIDER ILYIN'S THEORY OF LAW, LEGAL CONSCIOUS-NESS, POWER AND THE STATE, FOCUSING ON THE ESSENCE OF NATURAL LAW, CATEGORY "NORMAL LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS" AND ITS THREE AXIOMS. WHEN CONSIDERING POWER AND THE STATE, ILYIN EMPHASIZED THEIR LEGAL NATURE AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MONARCHICAL AND REPUBLICAN LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS COMPARE ILYIN'S THEORETICAL CONCLUSIONS WITH THE CONTEMPORARY RUSSIAN SOCIETY. THEY ARGUE THAT ILYIN SAW THE ROOTS OF RUSSIA'S FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE GENERAL TRANSFORMATION OF HUMAN CULTURE, I.E. CONSISTENT DECHRISTIANIZATION OF ALL SOCIAL SPHERES. THIS TREND LED TO CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN RUSSIA -THE REVOLUTION OF 1917, ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ATHEISTIC SOVIET SYSTEM, AND THE PREDICTED DISINTEGRATION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE POST-SOVIET PERIOD. THE MAIN ILYIN'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING THE SYSTEM CRISIS ARE REFORMS OF THE STATE-LEGAL SPHERE, IN PARTICULAR REVIVAL OF THE "NORMAL LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS" AND UPDATE OF THE NATIONAL IDEA SO THAT PATRIOTISM WOULD TAKE THE LEADING POSITION. IN THE STATE BUILDING ILYIN PREFERRED STRONG POWER AND AUTHORITATIVE LEADERSHIP, AND ALSO IMPLEMENTATION OF "CREATIVE" DEMOCRACY PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, LEGALITY, FAIR TRIAL AND CIVIL INITIATIVE.
25	LATIN AMERICA LEADS THE WORLD IN EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE PERPETRATORS OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN DOMESTIC COURTS. DOMESTIC JUSTICE OFFERS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES TO INTERNATIONAL AND HYBRID TRIBUNALS: PROCEEDINGS TAKE PLACE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SITE OF THE ATROCITIES, FACILITATING VICTIM PARTICIPATION; THEY ARE DIRECTED BY DOMESTIC PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL BUY-IN; AND THEY CAN STRENGTHEN RULE OF LAW AND LEGITIMIZE FRAGILE TRANSITIONAL DEMOCRACIES. THE CASE OF GUATEMALA APPEARS TO CONTRADICT SUCH ARGUMENTS, HOWEVER, GIVEN THE OVERTURNING OF THE LANDMARK CONVICTION OF FORMER DICTATOR JOSE EFRAIN RIOS MONTT ON CHARGES OF GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND THE ONGOING IMPASSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS. DRAWING ON THE AUTHOR'S WORK AS AN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER TO THE GENOCIDE TRIAL, INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE CASE, AND COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON HUMAN RIGHTS TRIALS IN LATIN AMERICA, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS AN ALTERNATIVE READING. BY SITUATING THE GENOCIDE TRIAL IN RELATION TO THE BROADER TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESS IN GUATEMALA AND IN THE REGION MORE BROADLY, IT ARGUES THAT CURRENT SETBACKS SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A BACKLASH TO INITIAL TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE SUCCESS THAT IS NEITHER UNEXPECTED NOR FATAL TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE GENOCIDE CASE IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF A VICTIM-CENTRED APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS THAT HOLD IMPORTANT LESSONS FOR TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE THEORY AND PRACTICE, AND EXAMINES THE WAY IN WHICH VICTIMS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE WERE INCORPORATED INTO PROSECUTORIAL STRATEGIES AND HELPED TO PROVE THAT A GENOCIDE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN GUATEMALA. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT DESPITE THE UNDOING OF THE GENOCIDE VERDICT, THE VERY FACT THAT THE TRIAL TOOK PLACE IS HISTORICALLY AND POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT, BOTH FOR SURVIVORS AND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY IN GUATEMALA AND LATIN AMERICA AS A WHOLE.
26	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE VIEWS OF THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY APPLICABLE TO THE STAFF OF CRIMINAL-EXECUTIVE SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FOR THE COMMISSION OF WRONGFUL ACTS OF CORRUPTION. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN THE SYSTEM OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT BODIES SHALL ENTAIL EXTREMELY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY THAT DIRECTLY CONTRADICT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME, UNDERMINE FAITH IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE POSSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY. THE COMMISSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS OF EMPLOYEES OF THE CRIMINAL-EXECUTIVE SYSTEM OF RUSSIA IS THE LINK AND THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN MEASURES OF RESPONSIBILITY (PENALTIES) PROVIDED FOR THE COMMISSION OF DISCIPLINARY OFFENCES, ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES AND CRIMINAL OFFENCES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A COMPLEX OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND THE PRESENT WORK TO PREVENT THE VIOLATION OF SERVICE DISCIPLINE STAFF OF CRIMINAL-EXECUTIVE SYSTEM DOES NOT PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE PROBLEMS OF APPLICATION OF MEASURES OF DISCIPLINARY AND ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY FOR OFFENCES BY OFFICERS OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE OF RUSSIA. THE ARTICLE PROPOSES THE INTRODUCTION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY FOR TRANSMISSION OR ATTEMPTED TRANSMISSION OF PROHIBITED ITEMS ON THE TERRITORY OF THE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEE OF THE CRIMINAL-EXECUTIVE SYSTEM. THE AUTHOR PROVES THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE MEASURE AFFECTING THE REDUCTION OF CASES OF INTRODUCTION OF PROHIBITED ARTICLES INTO THE TERRITORY OF THE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION, WILL ALLOW TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF LATENT CRIMES AND WILL BE A PREVENTIVE MEASURE, AS TO COMMIT SIMILAR OFFENCES AND CRIMES, AND ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCTION OF CORRUPTION-RELATED CRIMES IN THE MECHANISM OF ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIVITIES IN THE CRIMINAL-EXECUTIVE SYSTEM OF RUSSIA.
27	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS A VERY RELEVANT ACTOR IN THE POLITICAL SCENE. THE EU'S EXTERNAL ACTION IS INSPIRED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF PEACE AND RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE EU IS COMPOSED OF DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND LEADERS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A SINGLE VOICE. THIS PROMOTES A FEELING OF REMOTENESS THAT THREATENS THE LEGITIMACY OF THE EU POLITICAL SYSTEM. IN RECENT YEARS, THE EU HAS FACED MANY INTERNAL CHALLENGES, SUCH AS THE REFUGEE CRISIS AND BREXIT, BUT RECENT EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN AND UKRAINE REVEAL THE NEED TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE EU AS AN INTERNATIONAL ACTOR. BEARING THESE TRENDS IN MIND, THIS RESEARCH AIMED TO EXPLORE THE MANAGEMENT OF CRISIS COMMUNICATION BY THE EU LEADERS REGARDING THE TWO MOST RECENT INTERNATIONAL EVENTS: AFGHANISTAN IN 2021 AND UKRAINE IN 2022. SPECIFICALLY, WE ANALYZE THE PROFILES OF URSULA VON DER LEYEN (@VONDERLEYEN), JOSEP BORRELL (@JOSEPBORRELLF), AND CHARLES MICHEL (@EUCOPRESIDENT). CONTENT ANALYSIS IS MANUALLY PERFORMED ON 479 TWEETS ON MILITARY CONFLICTS OVER A GENERAL SAMPLE OF 661 MESSAGES. THE STRATEGIES AND SPECIFIC TOPICS ARE STUDIED BASED ON A PRETEST. IN ADDITION, WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT RATE OF THE TWEETS. IN THIS SENSE, THE DATA WERE CAPTURED FOR A 2-MONTH PERIOD (15 AUGUST TO 15 SEPTEMBER 2021 AND 24 FEBRUARY TO 24 MARCH 2022). AS A RESULT, WE SHOW THE PREDOMINANCE OF MESSAGES ON UKRAINE TOGETHER WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ACTION OF VON DER LEYEN IN TERMS OF STRATEGIES AND EMPLOYMENT OF THE TOOLS OF TWITTER. HER IMPACT RATE IS ALSO HIGHER. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO CURRENT DISCUSSIONS ON THE MISSION OF COMMUNICATION TO FOSTER TRUST, SINCE THE ANTI-PUBLICITY BIAS OF THE EU REQUIRES BETTER LEVELS OF COHERENCE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATE MESSAGES.
28	A MORE SCIENTIFIC GREEN ECONOMY EFFICIENCY INDICATOR IS CONSTRUCTED BASED ON OH (2010), AND A MULTIPERIOD SPATIAL DID MODEL IS USED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICIES ON URBAN GREEN ECONOMY EFFICIENCY IN A SAMPLE OF CITIES ABOVE THE PREFECTURE LEVEL IN THE YANGTZE RIVER DELTA. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICY MAKES A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEN ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF CITIES, AND IT IS CONDUCIVE TO STRENGTHENING AWARENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MARKET TO REGULATE MARKET ORDER. (2) THE DEMAND FOR CREDIT REGULATION IN COASTAL AREAS HAS INCREASED UNDER THE NEW DEVELOPMENT PATTERN, AND THE NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICY HAS EFFECTIVELY ENHANCED GREEN ECONOMY EFFICIENCY THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL SUPPLY. (3) UNDER THE NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICY, THE SUBPROVINCIAL LEVEL AND ABOVE CAN MOBILISE MORE RESOURCES FOR POLICY REFINEMENT AND SUPPORT, REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS AND IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE GREEN ECONOMY. (4) THE IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICY ON THE EFFICIENCY OF ZHEJIANG'S GREEN ECONOMY IS MORE OBVIOUS; BUT, UNDER THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF THE YANGTZE RIVER DELTA, THE POLICY HAS A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN PROMOTING GREEN ECONOMY EFFICIENCY IN OTHER PROVINCES. POLICY INSIGHTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF IMPACT ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE GREEN ECONOMY FROM THE NATIONAL CREDIT DEMONSTRATION POLICY, AND THEY SHOULD IMPLEMENT DIFFERENTIATED MEASURES BASED ON REGIONAL HETEROGENEITY; (2) REGULATING THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES AND AVOIDING UNDUE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION ARE IMPORTANT PREREQUISITES FOR PROMOTING REGIONAL INTEGRATION TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE GREEN ECONOMY; AND (3) STRENGTHENING INTERPROVINCIAL CREDIT POLICY SYNERGIES CAN HELP TO ALLEVIATE ADMINISTRATIVE DISTORTIONS OF POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE REGIONAL GREEN ECONOMY.
29	THE RADICAL POLITICAL VIOLENCE OUTGOING FROM EXTREMIST COMMUNITIES BECAME THE MOST DANGEROUS TREND IN THE MODERN CRIMINAL DYNAMICS. THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY SUICIDE TERRORISTS ARE NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIOLENCE, BUT ALSO ABSOLUTELY RANDOM PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF POLITICS. THE ACTUAL PERPETRATORS OF MASS HOMICIDE, INCLUDING THE MOST BRUTAL ACTS OF TERRORISM, ARE EXTREMISTS WITH HOMICIDE-SUICIDAL SYNDROME, INTERESTED IN THE SOCIETY'S ATTENTION TO THEM, CONVINCED, IN AN IRRATIONAL WAY, THAT ABSOLUTELY ALL PEOPLE ARE GUILTY OF THEIR PROBLEMS. THE FATE OF EXTREMISTS AND VICTIMS OF THEIR RADICAL VIOLENCE IS NOT ALWAYS DIRECTLY DETERMINED BY THE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT OR ORGANIZED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW STATE AND OTHER SOCIAL MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS. THESE WELL-KNOWN CRIMINOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS AFFECT THE FORM OF EXTREMIST ACTIONS AND CRIMES, THEY MAY LOWER THE LEVEL OF EXTREMIST AGGRESSION, BUT DO NOT CHANGE THE MOTIVES OF CRIMINALS. THE HIGHER THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRY, THE LESS FREQUENTLY MASS HOMICIDE WILL HAPPEN, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO USE HIGH TECH. LIMITING THE USE OF FIREARMS BY EXTREMISTS, WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THEIR ATTEMPTS TO ADAPT VEHICLES FOR DEADLY PURPOSES. THE ACTIONS OF EXTREMISTS DO NOT REFLECT ANY REAL POLITICAL STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE, FOR RELIGIOUS VALUES, FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE; IN PRACTICE, THERE IS IRRATIONAL EXTREMISM - A NEW SOCIO-POLITICAL PHENOMENON OF ACTIVE CRIMINAL PROTEST AGAINST THE VERY IDEA OF HUMANISM. VIOLENT EXTREMISM EMERGES AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A CERTAIN SOCIAL SITUATION: 1) LOW EFFICIENCY OF SOCIAL POLICY; 2) ISOLATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL FROM CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS AND STATE STRUCTURES; 3) DESPERATE HUMAN DESIRE FOR SELF-REALIZATION THAT IS SET AGAINST UNIVERSAL INDIFFERENCE TO THE PROBLEMS OF AN INDIVIDUAL. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CRIMINOGENIC FACTORS, AN EXTREMIST'S PERSONALITY MAY BECOME THE OBJECT OF MANIPULATION BY TERRORIST GROUPS AND OTHER CRIMINAL COMMUNITIES.
30	IT IS A COMMON LAMENT THAT PROSECUTORS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE TOO ADVERSARIAL. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN A DEEPER SENSE, PROSECUTORS MAY NOT BE ADVERSARIAL ENOUGH. THE ISSUE WHICH I CALL ADVERSARIAL ASYMMETRY IS THAT, AS POLITICAL ACTORS, PROSECUTORS HAVE NO INHERENT DESIRE TO SEEK MAXIMAL PUNISHMENT, AT LEAST IN ANY CONSISTENT WAY. WHILE COMMENTATORS TEND TO SEE THIS AS A GOOD THING, ADVERSARIAL ASYMMETRY HELPS EXPLAIN A RANGE OF SEEMINGLY DISPARATE PATHOLOGIES IN THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS INCLUDING THE COERCIVENESS OF PLEA BARGAINING; PRETEXTUAL PROSECUTION; DISCRIMINATORY CHARGING PRACTICES; THE PROLIFERATION OF OVERLY BROAD CRIMINAL STATUTES; THE DIFFICULTY IN DETERRING PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT; AND USE OF THE GRAND JURY AS POLITICAL COVER FOR UNPOPULAR DECISIONS WOULD NOT EXIST, OR AT LEAST COULD BE MORE EASILY SOLVED, IN A WORLD WHERE PROSECUTORS WERE MORE SINGLE MINDEDLY FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING VICTORY IN THE CRIMINAL PROCESS. IN FACT, A MORE CONSISTENTLY ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE SURPRISING ADVANTAGES OVER OUR OWN, PROVIDING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROSECUTORS WHILE BEING MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. AND WHILE HEIGHTENED ADVERSARIALISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSES RISKS, ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES COULD MINIMIZE THOSE DANGERS. EVEN IF ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SYSTEM IS UNREALISTIC OR UNAPPEALING, THE PROPOSAL HAS VALUE AS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT, FOR IT EXPOSES DEEP FAULT LINES IN THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF OUR SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. OUR CURRENT APPROACH COMBINES AN ADVERSARIAL PROCESS WITH POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE PROSECUTORS YET WE LACK A COMPELLING ACCOUNT OF WHAT PRECISE LEVEL OF ADVERSARIALISM IS OPTIMAL OR WHY POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY IS THE RIGHT TOOL FOR PRODUCING GOOD BEHAVIOR FROM PROSECUTORS. IT SHOULD THUS BE UNSURPRISING THAT OUR SYSTEM OFTEN WORKS POORLY IN PRACTICE. ABSENT A BETTER REASON TO THINK THAT OUR CURRENT APPROACH IS THE ONLY OPTION, WE SHOULD BE MORE WILLING TO RECONSIDER BASIC STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENTS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE.
31	CANADA'S FEDERAL POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS TO RECONCILE DIFFERENCES OVER THE BALANCE BETWEEN SHARED RULE AND SELF-RULE CONCERNING TWO BEDROCK PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT: THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT OF THE EXERCISE OF THE POWER OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT USURPED. THE HALLMARK OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF MULTILEVEL SECURITY GOVERNANCE IN CANADA IS HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL DIFFERENTIATION OF DIVERSE TERRITORIAL AND NON-TERRITORIAL COMMUNITY VALUES, PREFERENCES, INTERESTS AND VALUES HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE ASYMMETRIC DECENTRALIZATION. THIS ARTICLE MAPS THE HISTORICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ROOTS, AND THEN DRAWS ON EXAMPLES IN A SURVEY OF ITS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ACROSS THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. IT CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING THE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES THAT SHARED SOVEREIGNTY AND MISMATCHED JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITIES POSE FOR THE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PROVISION OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN CANADA. SOMMAIRE LE SYSTEME POLITIQUE FEDERAL CANADIEN DOIT RECONCILIER DES DIFFERENCES AU SUJET DE L'EQUILIBRE ENTRE LE PARTAGE DU POUVOIR ET L'AUTONOMIE CONCERNANT DEUX PRINCIPES FONDAMENTAUX DU GOUVERNEMENT CONSTITUTIONNEL: LA PRIMAUTE DU DROIT ET LA SURVEILLANCE DEMOCRATIQUE DE L'EXERCICE DU POUVOIR DE L'ETAT AFIN DE VEILLER A CE QU'IL NE SOIT PAS USURPE. LA DIFFERENTIATION HORIZONTALE ET VERTICALE D'UNE VARIETE DE VALEURS, DE PREFERENCES ET D'INTERETS COMMUNAUTAIRES TERRITORIAUX ET NON TERRITORIAUX A ENTRAINE LA DECENTRALISATION ASYMETRIQUE QUI EST LA CARACTERISTIQUE DE L'ADMINISTRATION DE LA GOUVERNANCE DE LA SECURITE A NIVEAUX MULTIPLES AU CANADA. CET ARTICLE ETABLIT LES RACINES HISTORIQUES ET CONSTITUTIONNELLES, PUIS S'APPUIE SUR DES EXEMPLES D'UN SONDAGE DE SA STRUCTURE INSTITUTIONNELLE AUX TROIS PALIERS DE GOUVERNEMENT. IL SE TERMINE PAR UNE DISCUSSION SUR LES DEFIS DE GOUVERNANCE QUE POSENT LA SOUVERAINETE PARTAGEE ET LES AUTORITES DE JURIDICTIONS DEPAREILLEES POUR MAINTENIR DE MANIERE EFFICACE ET EFFICIENTE LA SECURITE PUBLIQUE AU CANADA.
32	THE STATE OF CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY IS IN FLUX. WHAT WAS ONCE THE PRESERVE OF THOSE WHO ORGANIZED THE STATE BECAME THE EXPRESSION OF MASS DEMOCRACY AND THE POPULAR WILL, ONE THAT HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CONSTRAINED BY INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON THE LIMITS OF POLITICAL WILL WITHIN NATIONAL BORDERS. THE STAKES ARE HIGHCONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO INTERNAL POLITICAL STABILITY AND TO INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE. AMONG THE MOST CONTESTED FORMS OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATES ARE PARTY-STATE SYSTEMS GROUNDED IN MARXIST-LENINIST THEORY. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS JIANG SHIGONG'S DEVELOPMENT OF A COHERENT AND LEGITIMATING CONSTITUTIONALIST THEORY OF CHINA'S PARTY-STATE SYSTEM. IT CONSIDERS JIANG'S ARGUMENT THAT CONSTITUTIONALISM MUST START WITH VALUES AND STRUCTURE AND THEN CONSIDERS THE MECHANICS THROUGH WHICH IT IS INSTITUTIONALIZEDEITHER IN WRITING OR THROUGH STRUCTURALIST APPROACHES. IT ALSO EXAMINES JIANG'S CONSTRUCTION OF A FORMAL-FUNCTIONAL THEORY OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THE DEMOCRATIC BASIS AND THE REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTER OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY WITHIN THE PARTY-STATE SYSTEM. JIANG'S THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS POINT TO THE DEEPENING OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGITIMACY OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM. JIANG SHIGONG IS PART OF A SMALL GROUP OF CHINESE ACADEMICS WHO ARE WORKING ALONG DISTINCT PATHS TO MOVE BEYOND THE LEGITIMACY ISSUE OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND TACKLE THE MUCH HARDER BUT MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISM ALONG THE LINES OF ITS OWN LOGIC. CRITICAL TO THAT PROJECT ARE NOTIONS OF CIVIC EDUCATION AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AT THE HEART OF CHINESE CONSTITUTIONALISMONE THAT DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION AND RULE OF LAW, AND THE POLITICAL POWER OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, INCLUDING THE NATION'S CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS.
33	RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED REPRESSIONS IN ESTONIA DURING THE SOVIET ERA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES: FIRST, A PARTICULAR KIND OF COERCION WHICH VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS BUT WAS BACKED UP BY THE SOVIET LEGAL SYSTEM INCLUDED THE ADMINISTRATION OF RELIGIOUS LIFE (I.E. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS) AND ATHEISTIC PROPAGANDA WITH NO FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS SPEECH. THE SECOND CATEGORY INCLUDES DIRECT REPRESSIONS WITH MUCH HARSHER WAYS OF NEUTRALISING OPPOSITION. UNTIL THE END OF THE STALINIST ERA, CONTROL OVER CHURCHES WAS ACHIEVED BY MASS REPRESSIONS, FEAR AND AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CHURCHES AND THE STATE. LATER, PREVENTIVE METHODS AND COERCION ("ADMINISTRATION") BECAME THE MAIN METHODS FOR DEALING WITH THE "RELIGION PROBLEM". REPRESSIONS WERE MOSTLY PERSONAL AND WERE USED ONLY WHEN ONE TESTED THE LIMITS OF WHAT WAS PERMITTED. SINCE LIFE IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE LAWS THEMSELVES VIOLATED HUMAN RIGHTS AND LIMITED FREEDOM OF SPEECH, MOST ASPECTS OF ARTICLE 18 OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WERE MORE OR LESS VIOLATED IN ESTONIA. MEANWHILE, COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE SOVIET UNION, THE SITUATION IN ESTONIA WAS QUITE MILD DUE TO THE LACK OF A TENSE RELIGIOUS SITUATION. THIS WAS A RESULT OF AT LEAST FOUR CAUSES: CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNING BODIES OF CHURCHES WAS ACHIEVED QUITE QUICKLY; CHURCHES WERE HELD QUITE LOW IN ESTEEM; DUE TO SOVIET RITUALS, RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS WERE SEVERED AND RELIGION WAS FORCED TO THE PERIPHERY; WEAK CONNECTION BETWEEN RELIGION AND NATIONALISM. ALTHOUGH THE METHODOLOGY OF THE CONTROL OF THE RELIGION PROBLEM WAS QUITE DIVERSE AND DIVISIONS WERE NUMEROUS, ARCHIVAL SOURCES LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE OUTCOME WAS QUITE POOR AND EVEN CHAOTIC. IT POINTS OUT THAT ZEITGEIST AND FEAR PLAYED QUITE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CREATING THE ATMOSPHERE AND COERCION HOSTILE TO RELIGION.
34	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE JAPANESE LEGAL RESPONSES TO COVID-19. JAPAN DID NOT DECLARE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. IN ADDITION, IT DID NOT ENACT A NEW LAW AND INSTEAD AMENDED EXISTING STATUTES SEVERAL TIMES TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION. THE PAPER FIRST INTRODUCES PROVISIONS OF THE NOVEL INFLUENZA ACT AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACTS PROVISIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THE FEBRUARY 2021 AMENDMENTS. THE REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THE JAPANESE COUNTERMEASURES WAS THE FOCUS ON NON-COERCIVE MEASURES. THERE IS NO COMPULSORY SCHEME TO ENSURE "STAYING AT HOME" FOR GENERAL RESIDENTS. REGARDING THE FACILITY MANAGERS, THE NIA PROVIDED FOR THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE OF THE "RECOMMENDATION" TO ENSURE EFFECTIVENESS. THE LEGAL NATURE OF SUCH PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS IS DISPUTED IN JAPANESE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE FEBRUARY 2021 AMENDMENTS ADDED THE POSSIBILITY OF ISSUING AN ORDER WHOSE EFFECTIVENESS WAS GUARANTEED BY ADMINISTRATIVE FINES. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE TRADITIONAL EMPHASIS OF "ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE" IN JAPAN AND PROPOSES HYPOTHESES AS TO WHY OPEN NON-COMPLIANCE CASES OF FACILITY MANAGERS ARE OBSERVED. CONCERNING PATIENTS, PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY 2021 AMENDMENT, THE IDA PROVIDED FOR THE PROBLEMATIC LEGAL FIGURES OF "RECOMMENDATION" AND "IMMEDIATE EXECUTION". THE FEB. 2021 AMENDMENT, WHICH ADDED ADMINISTRATIVE FINES, MADE THE LEGAL FIGURE MORE COMPLEX. COVID-19 COUNTERMEASURES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE DIFFICULTY OF LEGAL CONTROL WHEN PUBLIC BEHAVIOR CHANGE IS A POLICY GOAL. WE MUST PROCEED BY TRIAL AND ERROR AND ACCUMULATE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING LEGAL REGULATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL MESSAGES THAT EFFECTIVELY AFFECT PUBLIC BEHAVIOR. IN THE PROCESS, WE SHOULD EMBRACE THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, SUCH AS THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT DECISIONS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL IS A MATTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISCRIMINATION, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE UNFORTUNATE HISTORY OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL IN JAPAN.
35	THIS PAPER PROPOSES A SYSTEMS-THEORETICAL APPROACH TO THE ROLE OF GUANXI-BASED, AMAKUDARI-BASED AND OTHER TRADITIONAL PRACTICES, FOUNDED ON GROUP LOYALTY AND SUPERVISOR-SUBORDINATE RELATIONSHIPS, IN MAKING TRANSITIONS FROM AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF UNSUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS IN ORIENT AND NON-WESTERN CULTURES AND OF THE DEGRADATION OF NEW DEMOCRACIES IN EASTERN-EUROPEAN AND ASIAN STATES. MANY HYBRID OR SEMI-DEMOCRACIES FALL SHORT IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES OR THE PROTECTION OF ECONOMIC OR HUMAN RIGHTS. YOUNGER DEMOCRACIES ARE MORE CORRUPT, EXHIBIT LESS RULE OF LAW, UNCOMPETITIVE ELECTIONS, UNCONTROLLED BUREAUCRACY, SHRINKED INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND MAY SLIDE TO AUTHORITARIANISM THROUGH POPULISM. AND THERE ARE ALSO THE WELL-KNOWN PROBLEMS OF COLLECTIVE AND CIVIL ACTIONS TO PROVIDE COLLECTIVE GOODS. IN NON-WESTERN STATES COLLECTIVE ACTION ADHERES TO TRADITIONS AND INDIGENOUS FORMS OF GROUP LOYALTY. THE TRADITIONAL WAYS FOR REALIZING INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS ARE BASED ON PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONS IN THESE SOCIETIES. AND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW SUCH RELATIONS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST RELIABLE WAY OF SATISFYING INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS OF GAINING ADVANTAGES FROM POWER THAN FIGHTING FOR COMMON GOODS AND CIVIL VALUES THROUGH THE TRANSITION TO A MORE DEMOCRATIC REGIME, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIVE POLITICAL CHANGES MOVING TOWARDS A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF COMMON GOODS. THE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR IS TO IDENTIFY THE DEPENDENCE OF THE CHANGING BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS TO COMPONENTS OF ENGAGEMENT IN PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONS. TRADITIONAL PATRON-CLIENT (SUPERIOR-SUBORDINATE) RELATIONS AS A STRUCTURING SOCIAL EXCHANGE ARE BASED ON SOME VARIABLES, SUCH AS BENEFITS\CONTRIBUTIONS, LOYALTY, RECIPROCITY, PERSONAL COMMITMENT, OBLIGATION, SUBORDINATE, COLLECTIVISM, PERSONAL-LIFE INCLUSION ETC. THE MODEL HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHAT VARIABLES CHANGE SOMEONE'S BEHAVIOR FROM SEEKING CIVIL VALUES AND COMMON GOODS TO PRIORITISING INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS' BENEFITS RELATING TO THE PATRON-CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS IN NON-WESTERN CULTURES.
36	DISCUSSION ABOUT VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES SPREAD FROM RESEARCH ETHICS TO CONSUMER LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ACCORDING TO MANY THEORETICIANS AND PRACTITIONERS, THE FRAMEWORK OF VULNERABILITY ALLOWS FORMULATING AN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE TO ARTICULATE PROBLEMS OF INEQUALITY, POWER IMBALANCES AND SOCIAL INJUSTICE. BUILDING ON THIS CONCEPTUALISATION, WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND POTENTIALITY OF THE NOTION OF VULNERABLE DATA SUBJECTS. THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS REFLECTION IS WIDE-RANGING DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT AND USE OF DATA-DRIVEN TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY POSE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS TO HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES CAN LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION SYSTEMATIC MARGINALISATION OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND THE EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE IN PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE LIFE SITUATIONS. CONSIDERING THOSE PROBLEMS, WE RECOGNISE THE SPECIAL ROLE OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION AND CALL FOR ITS VULNERABILITY-AWARE INTERPRETATION. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THREE CONTRIBUTIONS. FIRST, WE EXAMINE HOW THE NOTION OF VULNERABILITY IS CONCEPTUALISED AND USED IN THE PHILOSOPHY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND EUROPEAN LAW. WE THEN CONFRONT THOSE FINDINGS WITH THE PRESENCE AND INTERPRETATION OF VULNERABILITY IN DATA PROTECTION LAW AND DISCOURSE. SECOND, WE IDENTIFY TWO PROBLEMATIC DICHOTOMIES THAT EMERGE FROM THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS CONCEPT IN DATA PROTECTION. THOSE DICHOTOMIES REFLECT THE TENSIONS WITHIN THE DEFINITION AND MANIFESTATION OF VULNERABILITY. TO OVERCOME LIMITATIONS THAT AROSE FROM THOSE TWO DICHOTOMIES WE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF LAYERED VULNERABILITY, WHICH SEEMS COMPATIBLE WITH THE GDPR AND THE RISK-BASED APPROACH. FINALLY, WE OUTLINE HOW THE NOTION OF VULNERABILITY CAN INFLUENCE THE INTERPRETATION OF PARTICULAR PROVISIONS IN THE GDPR. IN THIS PROCESS, WE FOCUS ON ISSUES OF CONSENT, DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENT, THE ROLE OF DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES, AND THE PARTICIPATION OF DATA SUBJECTS IN THE DECISION MAKING ABOUT DATA PROCESSING.

37	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER GOOD GOVERNANCE ACROSS COUNTRIES, UTILISING THE RULE OF LAW INDICATOR OF THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, IS ASSOCIATED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH, MEASURED IN TERMS OF REAL GDP. IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT IN THIS PAPER BOTH VARIABLES ARE MEASURED IN TERMS OF CHANGES, COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE. IT IS HYPOTHESISED THAT A COUNTRY WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND A HIGH LEVEL OF GOOD GOVERNANCE (TYPICALLY AN ECONOMICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRY) TENDS TO FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE THESE TWO VARIABLES, WHEN COMPARED TO A COUNTRY WITH LOWER LEVELS GDP PER CAPITA AND GOOD GOVERNANCE (TYPICALLY AN ECONOMICALLY BACKWARD COUNTRY). THIS ASSUMPTION IS TERMED THE "DIMINISHING MARGINAL GOVERNANCE EFFECT". DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT GOVERNANCE IMPROVEMENTS ARE RELATED TO REAL GDP GROWTH, USING THE PANEL DATA REGRESSION APPROACH. IN THIS WAY BOTH VARIABLES ARE MEASURED IN TERMS OF CHANGES, COMPARING LIKE WITH LIKE. RELEVANT CONTROL VARIABLES ARE UTILISED TO IMPOSE THE CETERIS PARIBUS CONDITION. FINDINGS THE PAPER FINDS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE STATISTICALLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS CONFIRMS THE HYPOTHESISED "DIMINISHING MARGINAL GOVERNANCE EFFECT" EXPLAINED ABOVE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE VARIOUS BENEFICIAL SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD GOVERNANCE WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS A MAJOR PILLAR FOR ORDERLY SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. ECONOMIC GROWTH ALSO HAS IMPORTANT SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS AS IT MEANS, IF PROPERLY DISTRIBUTED, IMPROVEMENTS IN MATERIAL WELL-BEING OF THE POPULATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE ORIGINALITY OF THIS PAPER IS THAT IT MEASURES GOVERNANCE IN TERMS OF CHANGES AND NOT OF LEVELS. STUDIES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT MEASURE GOVERNANCE IN TERMS OF LEVELS GENERALLY DO NOT FIND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO VARIABLES. IN USING CHANGES IN BOTH GOVERNANCE AND REAL GDP, THIS PAPER CONFIRMS THE "DIMINISHING MARGINAL EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE", HYPOTHESIS.
38	A RATIONAL FOREIGN POLICY MUST DEFINE THE CRITERIA OF "NATIONAL INTEREST" IN A CONSISTENT AND TRANSPARENT MANNER IN ORDER TO ENABLE OTHER STATES TO CALCULATE THEIR BEHAVIOR ACCORDINGLY AND TO AVOID GLOBAL INSTABILITY. THE BASIC RATIONALE OF "NATIONAL INTEREST" IS THE SELF-PRESERVATION OF THE STATE FROM WHICH ALL SPECIFIC INTERESTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF NATIONAL SECURITY, ARE DERIVED. THE CONCEPT AS SUCH IS MULTIDIMENSIONAL, COMPRISING THE REALIZATION OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS OF THE RESPECTIVE POLITY IN THE WORLDWIDE INTERPLAY OF FORCES. IN THE ERA OF GLOBALIZATION, IT MUST NATURALLY BE DEFINED ON THE BASIS OF INTERDEPENDENCE AT THE FACTUAL AND RECIPROCITY OF INTERESTS AT THE NORMATIVE LEVEL. IN A UNIPOLAR POWER CONSTELLATION SUCH AS THE PRESENT ONE, THE UNILATERAL ASSERTION OF NATIONAL INTERESTS BY THE DOMINANT POWER, CLOAKED IN THE GUISE OF UNIVERSAL VALUES, RISKS TO CAUSE REGIONAL CONFLICTS AND GLOBAL INSTABILITY. ONLY IF EXERCISED IN A FRAMEWORK OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, IS THE POLICY OF NATIONAL INTEREST COMPATIBLE WITH PEACE. THIS MEANS THAT A GLOBAL BALANCE OF POWER, WHETHER BIPOLAR OR MULTIPOLAR, IS INDISPENSABLE FOR THE ASSERTION OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST. THE PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGN EQUALITY OF NATIONS, A BASIC NORM OF THE UN CHARTER, IS ONLY MEANINGFUL, AND THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY CAN ONLY BE REALIZED, IF STATES ACT ON THE BASIS OF MUTUALITY. FOR THE POLICY OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST NOT TO UNDERMINE ITS VERY FOUNDATION, NAMELY THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE AND THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS, IT MUST INCLUDE UNIVERSAL VALUES SHARED BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THE CONCEPT SHOULD THUS BE REDEFINED IN THE CONTEXT OF "MUTUAL GLOBAL INTERESTS." THOSE MUST INCLUDE THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW AS GUIDELINES OF A JUST WORLD ORDER.
39	EXCEPTION CALLS FOR THE ADOPTION OF UNIQUE AND EXTREME MEASURES. UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, HOWEVER, NO LIMIT MAY BE PLACED ON THE EXTREME REACTION TO IT, NOR CAN ITS BASIC TENETS BE INVALIDATED. HENCE MARTIAL LAW, AS ENVISAGED IN ARTICLE 116 OF THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION IS, IN SPITE OF THE SERIOUS SIGNIFICANCE ITS USE IMPLIES, A GUARANTEE OF THE CONSTITUTION; IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ITS ABOLITION. MARTIAL LAW PROVIDES CONCENTRATION OF POWER AND MILITARY HANDLING OF CRISIS; AND YET THE SUPREMACY OF LAW AND CIVIL POWER IS SAFEGUARDED. THE STUDY OF THE NATURE OF THIS INSTITUTION OF EXCEPTION, ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND JURISDICTIONAL MONITORING MAKES UP ONE PART OF THIS PAPER, WHICH STARTS OFF BY NOTING THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES DISTINGUISHING ITS CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION TO THAT OF ITS ANTECEDENTS. SYSTEMATICALLY, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES, FIRSTLY, THE GESTATION OF THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE INSTITUTION AND THE MOTIVES FOR THE DECLARATION THEREOF; NEXT, THE DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN MARTIAL LAW, THE DECLARATION OF WAR AND TIMES OF WAR, EXPRESSIONS USED TO REFER TO SITUATIONS THAT ARE DISTINCT ALTHOUGH INCIDENTALLY CONNECTED. WITH REGARD TO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THIS STATE, ANALYSIS IS MADE OF THE FUNCTION OF THE MILITARY DECREE UNDER THE PRINCIPAL OF PENAL LEGITIMACY, THE SCOPE OF MILITARY JURISDICTION, POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF LIBERTIES, THE MOTIVES FOR MILITARY HANDLING OF THE EMERGENCY AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKS ON THE POWER OF EXCEPTION. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A STUDY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR THE DECLARATION, EXTENSION AND TERMINATION OF THIS STATE OF EXCEPTION, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN IDENTIFYING THE LEGAL CHARACTERISTISATION OF DECLARATION AND EXTENSION DECISIONS AS "ACTS OF THE STATE WITH THE FORCE OF LAW", THEREBY ASCRIBING JURISDICTIONAL MONITORING OF THE SITUATION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL.
40	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CONCEPT OF HOLES RATHER THAN BORDERS TO ARTICULATE THE SPACE THAT US IMMIGRATION POLICING ENGENDERS. IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO BORDERS-LINES OR ZONES THAT CAN BE MAPPED, WALLED, OR POLICED TO DELIMIT SOVEREIGN BODIES-HOLES ARE STRATEGIC EXCEPTIONS TO MAPPABLE SOVEREIGNTIES. RATHER THAN FIXED, MAPPABLE BOUNDARIES, HOLES ARE MUTABLE AND IN FLUX, THRIVING ON THE SHIFTING POTENTIAL TO APPEAR OR DISAPPEAR AND TO MAKE PEOPLE DISAPPEAR AS LEGAL SUBJECTS. IF US IMMIGRATION POLICING OPERATES, TO A LARGE EXTENT, THROUGH HOLES DISTRIBUTED ACROSS BORDERS AND LONG-DISTANCE SPACES, THEN ANY MAPPING OF THIS POWER THAT CENTERS NATIONAL BORDERS OR BOUNDED NATION-STATES ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT. I SHOW HOW THE POLICING OF VENEZUELAN MIGRATION CENTERS THE DISTRIBUTION OF HOLES FROM SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA TO SPACES WITHIN THE US THAT ARE FAR FROM "THE BORDER." AGAINST A DISCURSIVE FOCUS ON "THE BORDER" AND THE BORDER WALL IN US RHETORIC ON IMMIGRATION, I ARGUE THAT THE ACTUAL PRACTICES OF IMPEDING FLOWS OF IMMIGRATION OR CHANNELING THEM THROUGH SPACES OF DEATH HAVE INCREASINGLY OPERATED THROUGH HOLEY SPACE. IF HOLY SPACE HAS BEEN DEFINED IN STUDIES OF RELIGION AS A SACRED SPACE SET APART FROM MUNDANE RULES, THEN THE HOL(E)Y SPACES OF IMMIGRATION ARE SET APART FROM FIXED CONCEPTIONS OF "THE RULE OF LAW." A FOCUS ON HOLES SHOWS HOW THE LEGAL ORDER OF IMMIGRATION DEPENDS MORE ON EXCEPTIONS, PERSONALIZED OR ARBITRARY POWER, AND THE INSTABILITY OF INTERIM EXTRA-LEGAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAN A DICHOTOMY OF LEGAL/ILLEGAL. DESPITE THEIR NECROPOLITICAL POWER, HOLES DO NOT CREATE AN ENTIRELY STRIATED, HIERARCHICAL SPACE. HOLES ARE ALSO RINGS OF CONNECTION AND PASSAGEWAYS, HIGHLIGHTING THE CREATIVITY AND AGENCY OF ASYLUM SEEKERS IN FORGING DIGNITY UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT CONDITIONS.
41	FOR MANY YEARS, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS RECOGNIZED THE FACT THAT CHILDREN, DUE TO THEIR AGE, HAVE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS AND NEEDS AS SUBJECTS OF LAW. THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE, BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY FACE JUSTICE. BECOMING A PARTICIPANT IN IT AS A WITNESS, VICTIM OR ACCUSED, THE CHILD, FIRSTLY, BECOMES INVOLVED IN THE ADULT WORLD, WHICH IS ALIEN TO HIM. SECONDLY, IT BECOMES MORE VULNERABLE IN RIGHTS, DUE TO ITS INCOMPLETE DEVELOPMENT AND LIMITED CAPABILITIES, AND THEREFORE NEEDS A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE. FINDING A BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC INTERESTS AND THE WELL-BEING OF THE CHILD IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING JUSTICE AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS A DIFFICULT AND URGENT TASK FOR ANY STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO SEEMS IMPORTANT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CHILD, WHILE CONTINUING TO GROW AND DEVELOP, IS STILL OPEN TO POSITIVE SOCIALIZATION, IN WHICH BOTH THE FAMILY AND THE STATE PLAY THE MAIN ROLES. TO STUDY THE PROBLEM, THE GOAL WAS SET TO STUDY THE EXPERIENCE OF GERMANY, SINCE THIS STATE HAS LONG FOCUSED ITS POLICY ON CHILDREN, DEVELOPING VARIOUS JUVENILE TECHNOLOGIES. THE SPECIFICS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF A CHILD IN IT ARE ANALYZED, AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GERMAN SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY, PEDAGOGY AND JURISPRUDENCE, ON ADJUSTING THE EXISTING JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ADAPTING IT TO THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD. IN PARTICULAR, SUCH ISSUES AS: FEATURES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE CHILD DURING THE TRIAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT OF THE CHILD AND THE USE OF AUDIO-VIDEO INTERROGATION OF THE CHILD ARE CONSIDERED. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, THE AUTHORS HAVE DRAWN CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVELY THE INSTITUTE WORKS IN GENERAL AND ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATING THE GERMAN EXPERIENCE INTO RUSSIA.
42	THE GEOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATIONS OF BRANDS AND BRANDING HAVE BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED IN THE COUNTRY-OF-ORIGIN (COO) EFFECT LITERATURE IN THAT A PRODUCT'S COO HAS A BRANDING EFFECT AND CONSUMERS HAVE PREFERENCES FOR GOODS FROM SPECIFIC COUNTRIES. THE AGGREGATION OF THESE PREFERENCES CAN LEAD TO UNIQUE AND ASYMMETRIC TRADING PATTERNS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THE GEOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATIONS OF BRANDS AND BRANDING TO DOMESTIC TRADE AND DOCUMENT THAT SELLER PROVINCES HAVE A BRANDING EFFECT AND GEOGRAPHIC PREFERENCE ASYMMETRIES CAN ARISE WITHIN PEER-TO-PEER TRADE NETWORKS SUCH AS TAOBAO IN CHINA. WE FIND THAT WHILE BUYERS IN ONE PROVINCE IN CHINA ARE WILLING TO PURCHASE GOODS FROM SELLERS IN ANOTHER PROVINCE, IT IS OFTEN THE CASE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT RECIPROCAL. THIS ASYMMETRY IN PREFERENCES PERSISTS AFTER CONTROLLING FOR TIME-VARYING FACTORS AT BOTH BUYER AND SELLER LOCATIONS. LIKE BRANDS, A LOCATION THEREFORE SERVES AS A QUALITY CUE AND REPUTATION MECHANISM FOR THE UNOBSERVED ATTRIBUTES OF SELLERS, PRODUCTS, AND LOGISTICS SERVICES FROM THAT LOCATION. WE THEN EXPLORE FACTORS THAT MIGHT BE CORRELATED WITH THESE TIME-INVARIANT PREFERENCES ACROSS PROVINCES. WE FIND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE GRAVITY EFFECT OF DISTANCE AND THE HOME-BIAS EFFECT, OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS DYADIC TRUST; MIGRATION; SIMILARITIES IN ETHNICITIES; OCCUPATIONS AND EDUCATION LEVELS; AND LEVELS OF MARKETIZATION AND RULE OF LAW ARE CORRELATED WITH THE ASYMMETRIES. NOTABLY, THESE FACTORS DIFFER FROM THOSE IDENTIFIED IN A CONTEMPORANEOUS STUDY OF EBAY IN THE US, IN WHICH RELIGIOSITY AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFERENCES (ELFENBEIN ET AL. 2018). WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE AND THE US EXPERIENCES DIFFER BECAUSE THE TWO COUNTRIES DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, LEGAL, AND COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENTS.
43	BACKGROUNDSUPERVISED CONSUMPTION SERVICES (SCS) ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS CANADA IN RESPONSE TO A VARIETY OF DRUG-RELATED HARMS. WE EXPLORED THE IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT OF NEWLY ESTABLISHED SCS IN TORONTO AND THE ROLE OF POLICING IN SHAPING PROGRAM ACCESS BY PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS (PWID).METHODSWE CONDUCTED ONE-TO-ONE QUALITATIVE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 24 PWID. PARTICIPANTS WERE PURPOSIVELY RECRUITED. ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED AT EACH OF THE STUDY SITES AS WELL AS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE NEIGHBOURHOODS. RELEVANT POLICY DOCUMENTS WERE ALSO REVIEWED.RESULTSPOLICING WAS OVERWHELMINGLY DISCUSSED BY PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH SCS SITES. HOWEVER, PARTICIPANT RESPONSES VARIED DEPENDING ON THE SITE IN QUESTION. SUBTHEMES FROM PARTICIPANT RESPONSES ON POLICING AT SITE #1 DESCRIBED NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICE PRESENCE AND FEARS OF POLICE HARASSMENT AND DRUG ARRESTS BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER ACCESSING SCS. CONVERSELY, SUBTHEMES FROM PARTICIPANT RESPONSES ON POLICING AT SITE #2 DESCRIBED IMMUNITY AND PROTECTION FROM POLICE WHILE USING THE SCS, AS WELL AS A LACK OF POLICE PRESENCE OR FEARS OF POLICE HARASSMENT AND ARRESTS. THESE DIFFERENCES IN IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXTS WERE LARGELY SHAPED BY DIFFERENCES IN LOCAL NEIGHBOURHOODS AND DRUG SCENES. POLICE POLICIES HIGHLIGHTED FEDERAL LAWS PROTECTING PWID WITHIN SCS, BUT ALSO THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION WHEN APPLYING THE RULE OF LAW OUTSIDE OF THESE SETTINGS.CONCLUSIONSPARTICIPANTS' PERSPECTIVES ON, AND EXPERIENCES WITH, POLICING AS THEY RELATE TO ACCESSING SCS WERE SHAPED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXTS OF EACH SCS SITE AND HOW NEIGHBOURHOODS, DRUG SCENES, AND DIFFERENCES IN POLICING PRACTICES AFFECTED SERVICE USE. OUR FINDINGS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE GOALS OF POLICING AND THOSE OF SCS. UNTIL LARGER STRUCTURAL BARRIERS ARE ADDRESSED (E.G. CRIMINALIZATION), FUTURE SCS PROGRAMMING SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF POLICING ON THE SCS IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT TO IMPROVE CLIENT EXPERIENCE WITH, AND ACCESS TO, SCS.
44	BACKGROUND: TO ACHIEVE THE AMBITION OF THE ENERGY TRANSITION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT, DUTCH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRY TO MOTIVATE CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE AS COMMUNITIES IN POLICY PROCESSES. THERE IS A GENERAL EXPECTATION THAT SUCH AN INTERACTIVE APPROACH WILL FOSTER A MORE RATIONAL POLICY OUTPUT AND WILL CREATE STRONGER SUPPORT FROM CITIZENS TOWARDS POLICY OUTCOMES. THE EMPHASIS PUT ON THIS OUTPUT-OUTCOME EFFECTIVENESS SHOULD NOT ECLIPSE ANOTHER MAJOR CRITERION OF GOVERNMENT POLICY-AND DECISION-MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION: THE LEGITIMACY OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY. MAJOR BUILDING BLOCKS OF SUCH LEGITIMACY ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE AIM OF THIS CONTRIBUTION IS TO IDENTIFY SAFEGUARDS FOR A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY IN INTERACTIVE REGIONAL GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES. METHODS: THE EMPIRICAL DATA ABOUT 'SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY OVERIJSSEL' IS GATHERED BY DOCUMENT STUDY, INCLUDING RESEARCH REPORTS, POLICY PLANS, AND PROJECT DOCUMENTS, AND BY STUDYING RECENT PUBLICATIONS AND NEWS ITEMS. THE ANALYSIS USES BEETHAM'S MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH OF LEGITIMACY AS POINT OF DEPARTURE. RESULTS: BEETHAM'S LEGITIMACY DIMENSIONS ARE ELABORATED UPON FROM A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY VIEWPOINT AND A REGULATORY STATE PRAGMATIC CHOICE BETWEEN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. FROM THIS, LEGITIMACY DIMENSIONS OF 'SHARED VALUES' AND 'CONSENT' EMERGE AS MOST SENSITIVE TO INTERACTIVE POLICY-MAKING, NECESSITATING PROPER SAFEGUARDS, SAFEGUARDS WITH RELEVANCE TO THE LEGITIMACY OF INITIATIVES SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY OVERIJSSEL. CONCLUSIONS: LEGITIMACY IS NEVER A GIVEN STANDARD, IT MAY BE DESIGNED INTO STRUCTURES AND AMBITIONS, BUT IT WILL STILL NEED TO BE ACHIEVED BY PROPER PRACTICE. THIS IS CERTAINLY THE CASE IN PROJECTS CONCERNING SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES OF WHICH EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS ARE BY NO MEANS CLEAR AND READILY DEPLOYABLE. THE OVERIJSSEL CASE SHOULD BE SEEN AS ONE OF MANY INTERESTING CASES TOWARDS EVIDENCE-BASED EFFECTIVE AND LEGITIMATE POLICY PRACTICES.
45	THE ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION LAW OF CHINA 1989 PAINTS A ROSY PICTURE IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE GOVERNMENT FACE EACH OTHER IN COURT, BOTH SUBMITTING TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE LAW. HOWEVER, IN REALITY, MANY ADMINISTRATIVE CASES DO NOT CONCLUDE WITH JUDICIAL RULINGS BUT LARGELY WITH WITHDRAWALS BY PLAINTIFFS (VARYING BETWEEN 30-57%). IN RECENT YEARS, COORDINATION AND SETTLEMENT IN ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATIONS ARE EVEN ADVOCATED IN THE OFFICIAL DIRECTIVES. THIS PAPER EMPLOYS NATIONAL STATISTICAL DATA, ARTICLES AND REPORTS WRITTEN BY JUDGES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IN MOST SITUATIONS, WITHDRAWALS IN ADMINISTRATIVE CASES HAVE NOT ONLY DENIED INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS THROUGH LITIGATION, BUT ALSO RENDERED ILLUSORY ANY POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION THAT LITIGATIONS MIGHT HAVE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW. THE LARGE NUMBER OF WITHDRAWALS INDICATES THE DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY THAT THE INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION FACES. EFFORTS MADE BY THE SUPREME PEOPLE'S COURT TO ENHANCE THE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE CASES OR REDUCE THE RATE OF WITHDRAWAL HAVE FAILED TO REVERSE THE GENERAL PATTERN. THE PREFERENCE FOR COORDINATION AND SETTLEMENT THAT COURTS AT ALL LEVELS HAVE EXPRESSED IN ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION MAY BE PARTLY MOTIVATED BY THE PREVAILING JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY, BUT IT IS BELIEVED TO BE PRIMARILY A COLLECTIVE COMPROMISE THAT COURTS HAVE MADE IN FACE OF CHALLENGING CONDITIONS. THE PAPER INDICATES THAT THE INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION, EMBEDDED IN THE CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF CHINA, CANNOT BE A MEANS FOR ACHIEVING CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE IN CHINA, AND ITS IMPACT ON SOCIAL CHANGE IS SEVERELY LIMITED. TO ELIMINATE THE OBSTACLES TO ADMINISTRATIVE LITIGATION, THE IMMEDIATE PRIORITY SHOULD BE THE PROMOTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND AUTHORITY. IN THE LONG TERM, THE REFORM DEPENDS ON THE GROWTH OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE PERFECTION OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.
46	SOUTH KOREA HAS EMERGED AS A NEW MIDDLE POWER THAT PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF IMPORTANT GLOBAL ISSUE AREAS AND SUPPORTS LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER WITH ITS LEADERSHIP DIPLOMACY. EVEN THOUGH REGIONAL CHALLENGES WILL CONTINUE TO DEMAND LARGE FOREIGN POLICY RESOURCES INCLUDING TIME, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND BUDGET, THE MIDDLE POWER ORIENTATION OF SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN POLICY BEHAVIOUR AND STRATEGYFOR EXAMPLE, MULTILATERALISM, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTION OF COOPERATION AND COMPROMISEWILL REMAIN IN PLACE EVEN IN THE CONDUCT OF REGIONAL FOREIGN POLICY. THIS OPTIMISM IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOUTH KOREA IS A MIDDLE POWER NOT ONLY IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE BUT ALSO IN THE EAST ASIAN REGION. EVEN ON THE ISSUE OF NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGE OF THE DAY, THE SOUTH HAS ACCEPTED THE REGIONALIZATION OF THE ISSUE AND, OVER TIME, ITS MIDDLE POWER ROLE. IT HAS RELIED ON THE MIDDLE POWER STRATEGY OF MOBILIZING INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ON THE NORTH RATHER THAN DEPLOYING AND STRENGTHENING ITS UNILATERAL OPTIONS SUCH AS THE USE OF FORCE OR MASSIVE ECONOMIC AID. IN ORDER TO FULLY REALIZE THE PROMISE AND POTENTIAL OF MIDDLE POWER DIPLOMACY, HOWEVER, SOUTH KOREA MUST MAKE STRONG EFFORTS TO ALLEVIATE STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS ON A MIDDLE POWER STRATEGY. FIRST, KOREAN LEADERS SHOULD UNDERTAKE A FULL-SCALE CAMPAIGN TO DE-NATIONALIZE KOREAN EDUCATION AND, THUS, KOREAN FOREIGN POLICY ORIENTATIONS. SECOND, A STRONG DOMESTIC CONSENSUS SHOULD EMERGE GIVING THE NATIONAL INTEREST PRECEDENCE OVER GROUP INTERESTS WHEN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES. FINALLY, POLITICAL LEADERS AND DIPLOMATS MUST CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND DELIVER TANGIBLE NATIONAL BENEFITS THROUGH MIDDLE POWER DIPLOMACY. MIDDLE POWER DIPLOMACY, LIKE ALL FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGIES, WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT STRONG DOMESTIC SUPPORT; AND DOMESTIC SUPPORT CANNOT BE BUILT ON GOODWILL AND COMMITMENT TO UNIVERSAL VALUES ALONE.
47	REVOLUTIONARY POLITICAL CHANGE CHALLENGES THE PARADIGMS USED TO UNDERSTAND AND LEGITIMATE LAW IN ORDINARY TIMES. PROFESSOR TEITEL ARGUES THAT CONVENTIONAL POLITICAL THEORY HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ANALYZED THE DISTINCTIVE NATURE OF JUSTICE DURING PERIODS OF POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION. DRAWING ON RECENT TRANSITIONS AROUND THE GLOBE, SHE ARGUES THAT LAW AND JUSTICE IN SUCH PERIODS TAKE ON A SIMULTANEOUSLY BACKWARD- AND FORWARD-LOOKING CHARACTER; EXTRAORDINARY LEGAL RESPONSES OPERATE TO MEDIATE SUCH PERIODS. IN ORDINARY TIMES, ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW LIMITS THE LAW'S REACH; HOWEVER IN PERIODS OF TRANSITION, SUCCESSOR REGIMES OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO HONOR IMMORAL COMMITMENTS OF THEIR PREDECESSORS, AND AT THE SAME TIME SEEK TO CONSTRUCT A SOCIETAL WILLINGNESS TO HONOR LAW UNDER THE NEW REGIME. ADHERENCE OR NONADHERENCE TO PRIOR LAW EXPRESSES THE RELATIONSHIP OF PRESENT TO PAST REGIME AND A NORMATIVE SHIFT THE CRIMINAL LAW IN SUCH PERIODS OFFERS AN ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT VENUE FOR TRANSITIONAL DECISIONMAKING. ITS NORMATIVE WORK IS COMPLICATED WHERE REPRESSION HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY ENTIRE REGIMES, BECAUSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE GENERALLY ASCRIBES INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN RECENT YEARS, A DISTINCTIVELY TRANSITIONAL CRIMINAL SANCTION THAT COMBINES PARTIAL PUNISHMENT WITH INVESTIGATION OF PAST WRONGDOING FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION AND EDUCATION HAS DEVELOPED. CONSTITUTIONALISM ALSO TAKES ON UNIQUE DIMENSIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF POLITICAL FLUX. BECAUSE SUCCESSOR CONSTITUTIONS OFTEN BROKER TRANSITIONS, THEY MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE POLITICAL EXPEDIENTS THEY HAVE NAVIGATED AS WELL AS THE LASTING PRINCIPLES THEY SEEK TO ENSHRINE. PROFESSOR TEITEL ARGUES THAT THE TRANSITIONAL LENS MAY PROFITABLY INFORM THE INTERPRETATION NOR ONLY OF CONSTITUTIONS IN TODAY'S EMERGING DEMOCRACIES, BUT ALSO OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION. ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN TRANSITION POINTS TO A DISTINCTIVE NEW PARADIGM OF JURISPRUDENCE CONSTITUTED BY AND CONSTITUTIVE OF LIBERALIZING POLITICAL CHANGE.
48	WHILE THE COLONIAL AND APARTHEID REGIMES UTILISED DRACONIAN, ARBITRARY, SEGREGATED, DISCRIMINATORY, AND EXCLUSIVE ANTI-BLACK SOCIAL-SOCIOECONOMIC POLICIES AND LAWS TO DENY THE MAJORITY OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS ACCESS TO AND PARTICIPATION IN VARIOUS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, POST 1994 DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA HAS STRATEGICALLY INTRODUCED PROGRESSIVE POLICIES AND LAWS TO ENSURE THAT BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS PLAY ACTIVE PRODUCTIVE ROLES IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN ALL SECTORS. WHILE THIS IS COMMENDABLE, VARIOUS CORPORATIONS AND BUSINESSES OWNED BY WHITE COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT BLACK PEOPLE BECOME PART AND PARCEL OF THE BUSINESSES, AND COMPANIES ARE BEING DENIED ACTIVE PARTICIPATION, USING FRONTING PURPOSEFULLY TO CIRCUMVENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ANTI-FRONTING LAWS. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ANALYSE THE POST-APARTHEID ANTI-FRONTING INTERVENTIONS THAT FOSTER THE MAINSTREAMING OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS INTO THE CORPORATE SECTOR. THE PAPER USES A LITERATURE REVIEW METHODOLOGY TO FIND AND ANALYSE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES OF DATA RELATING TO EQUALITY, BEE, AND FRONTING. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE HISTORICAL EXCLUSION OF BLACKS THROUGH THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF COLONIAL AND APARTHEID APPARATUSES AND LAWS BRUTALLY UTILISED TO EXCLUDE BLACKS FROM ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. POST 1994 DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATIVE INTERVENTIONS-LAWS-HAVE BEEN ENACTED TO REDRESS THE SEGREGATED AND EXCLUSIVE LAWS; HOWEVER, FRONTING ACTIVITIES AND PRACTICES CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE AND CIRCUMVENT SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. THIS SAID, THE POST 1994 GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO TACKLE IMPUNITY THROUGH THE EXPLORATION OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF PERPETRATORS AND USE THE RULE OF LAW-JUDICIAL MEANS TO HOLD PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE. THIS PAPER FOUND THAT FRONTING IS A PERSISTING ISSUE IN SOUTH AFRICA DESPITE ANTI-FRONTING LEGISLATIVE MEASURES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST YEARS WHEN THE B-BBEE ACT WAS AMENDED. THIS PAPER ADVISES MORE ON PRO-ACTIVE ANTI-FRONTING MEASURES TO PRO-ACTIVELY FOSTER THE MAINSTREAMING OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS INTO THE CORPORATE SECTOR.
49	THE PAPER ANALYSES B. N. CHICHERIN'S VIEWS ON THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETY, AND THEIR INTERACTION. THE EMPHASIS IS MADE ON TWO OPPOSITE SOCIAL TRENDS - ASPIRATION TOWARDS SOLIDARITY AND INDIVIDUALIZATION. BECAUSE OF HIS LIBERAL BELIEFS, THE PHILOSOPHER APPEARS TO FAVOR THE LATTER, PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT FOR B. CHICHERIN SOCIETY IS NOT SOMETHING SINGLE WHOLE, EXISTING BEYOND THE PERSON. A PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR AND ACTIONS ARE A STIMULUS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SERVING AS A MEANS TO COMMUNICATE THE 'WORLD'S ENERGY' AND GOALS OF HUMANITY. A VERY SPECIAL HISTORIC ROLE B. CHICHERIN ATTRIBUTES TO THE STATE, AS IT AFFECTS THE 'COLLECTIVE WILL,' NARODNOST', WHICH IS A BASIS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE GIVEN PAPER EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NARODNOST' AND HUMANITY - THE LATTER IS A GUARANTEE OF THE HISTORICAL UNITY, MEANING THAT NATIONS ARE TO INTERNALIZE THE PRODUCTS OF THE HISTORICAL PROGRESS. B. CHICHERIN ARRIVES AT THE CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE A UNIQUE HISTORY OF ITS OWN, RATHER IT NEEDS TO JOIN THE HISTORICAL GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS (IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE SCHOLAR CONFRONTS THE SLAVOPHILE DOCTRINE). THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THAT B. CHICHERIN APPLIES THE AFORE-MENTIONED PRINCIPLES TO THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RUSSIAN HISTORY. HE SEES THE ABSOLUTE AUTOCRACY AS AN OBSOLETE REGIME THAT PEACEFULLY NEEDS TO GIVE WAY TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. WHEN ANALYZING DIFFERENT FORMS OF LIBERALISM, THE PHILOSOPHER SUGGESTS THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONE IS 'PROTECTIVE LIBERALISM,' SINCE IT ENCOMPASSES FREEDOM, SOCIAL ORDER AND RULE OF LAW. EXAMINING THE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION, THE SCHOLAR CALLS FOR CAUTIOUS AND WELL THOUGHT-OVER REFORMS. HE ACKNOWLEDGES A LEADING ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, BELIEVING IN THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THEIR AUTONOMY AND INCREASING THEIR ACADEMIC STATUS.
50	IN RECENT DECADES, CRIMINOLOGISTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE OBSERVED A DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF CRIME, ESPECIALLY VIOLENT CRIME, THAT IS, THE SO-CALLED "GREAT CRIME DROP". HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL SAFETY MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO SUBJECTIVE SAFETY, I.E., HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE THEIR SAFETY AGAINST VARIOUS THREATS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE USE THE RUSSIAN CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY (2021) CONDUCTED BY THE INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AT THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY AT ST. PETERSBURG TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FEAR OF CRIME, AND THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND THE CRIMINOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESPONDENTS. THESE DATA MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS HOW THE EXPERIENCE OF VICTIMS OF VARIOUS CRIMES AND THEIR FEAR OF DIFERENT TYPES OF CRIMES ARE RELATED. WE FIND THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND FEAR OF CRIME IN RUSSIA ARE BROADLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, WE IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF NOTEWORTHY FEATURES REGARDING CRIME VICTIMS. FIRST, THE VICTIM EXPERIENCE INCREASES THE LEVEL OF FEAR OF CRIME ON AVERAGE. SECOND, THE MORE SERIOUS THE CRIME INCIDENTS PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST, THE HIGHER THEIR LEVEL OF FEAR OF CRIME. THIRD, VICTIMS OF CLASSIC IN-PERSON CRIMES (SUCH AS THEFT OR ASSAULT) OFTEN FEAR FUTURE CRIME. MOREOVER, IN CASE OF PROPERTY CRIME, THEY TEND TO FEAR FUTURE PROPERTY CRIME BUT NOT VIOLENCE. AT THE SAME TIME, VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE CAN FEAR FUTURE PROPERTY CRIME ALONG WITH VIOLENCE. THE FACT THAT THE INCIDENT WAS REMOTE (COMMITTED VIA THE INTERNET OR TELEPHONE) IS NOT RELATED TO THE FEAR OF CRIME. THUS, THE FEAR OF "CLASSIC" CRIMES IS EXPERIENCED DIFERENTLY BY THE VICTIMS AS COMPARED TO REMOTE CRIMES WHICH POSES BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DYNAMICS OF PERCEIVED SAFETY AND THE DEMAND FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE FUTURE.
51	PURPOSE: EDUCATION IS EXPECTED TO CREATE PEOPLE WHO CAN EVENTUALLY MAKE THE NATION A BETTER PLACE, RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND CHANGE PUBLIC PERCEPTION. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INFLUENCE OF CHARACTER EDUCATION AND TEACHER ATTITUDES FOR DERADICALIZATION. METHODOLOGY: THIS STUDY USED THE MIXED METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN. COMBINING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS. DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES INCLUDED QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS. FROM THE POPULATION OF 257 STUDENTS OF 8 JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS IN PONDOK AREN REGENCY, SOUTH TANGERANG CITY, BANTEN, INDONESIA, A SAMPLE OF 147 RESPONDENTS WAS SELECTED THROUGH PURPOSIVE SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS UTILIZED THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS USED SPSS. FINDINGS: THE AVERAGE SCORE FROM 147 RESPONDENTS SHOWS THAT MOST RESPONDENTS GAVE A HIGH SCORE TOWARD CHARACTER EDUCATION IN DERADICALIZATION. THE ENDOGENOUS VARIABLES OF CHARACTER EDUCATION AND TEACHERS' ATTITUDES TOWARD DERADICALIZATION HAD A GREATER CONTRIBUTION (53.7%) THAN OTHER FACTORS (46.3%). ALTHOUGH THE TEACHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS CHARACTER EDUCATION IN COUNTERING RADICALIZATION WAS 65.4% AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DIRECT INFLUENCE OF THE TEACHER'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE DERADICALIZATION OF STUDENTS WAS QUITE HIGH (73%), BUT IT STILL REQUIRES A CONTINUOUS APPLICATION FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AS WELL AS EQUATING VIEWS BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS' PARENTS. IMPLEMENTATIONS TO RESEARCH AND PRACTICE: THIS RESEARCH CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE TEACHER ATTITUDES AND CAN HELP TO INCREASE STUDENT NATIONALISM. AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DERADICALIZATION CAN TAKE THE FORM OF IDENTIFICATION, REHABILITATION, RE-EDUCATION, AND RE-SOCIALIZATION EFFORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS OR COMMUNITY GROUPS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY RADICAL BELIEFS BY PRIORITIZING THE PRINCIPLES OF EMPOWERMENT, HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND EQUALITY. IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL, EXEMPLARY ATTITUDES OF TEACHERS AND CHARACTER EDUCATION CAN INFLUENCE STUDENTS' BEHAVIOR TO COUNTERACT EXTREME BEHAVIOR THAT LEADS TO RADICALISM. (C) 2022 ANI PUBLISHING LTD.

52	WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF PEOPLE'S CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ONLINE LEGAL CONSULTATION HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT MEANS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO CONDUCT LEGAL CONSULTATION. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE EXPRESSIONS AND LEGAL PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS. THIS PHENOMENON MAY LEAD TO THE PHENOMENON OF DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SAME LEGAL CONSULTATION. HOW TO ACCURATELY UNDERSTAND THE TRUE INTENTIONS BEHIND DIFFERENT USERS' LEGAL CONSULTING STATEMENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED URGENTLY IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL CONSULTING SERVICES. TRADITIONAL INTENT UNDERSTANDING ALGORITHMS RELY HEAVILY ON THE LEXICAL AND SEMANTIC INFORMATION BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL DATA, AND ARE NOT SCALABLE, AND OFTEN REQUIRE TAXING MANUAL ANNOTATION WORK. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NEW APPROACH TDBRNN WHICH IS BASED ON THE NORMALIZED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION METHOD AND BI-LSTM TO LEARN USERS' INTENTION TO LEGAL CONSULTING. FIRST, WE PRESENT THE USERS' LEGAL CONSULTING STATEMENTS AS A TENSOR. AND THEN WE USE THE NORMALIZED TENSOR DECOMPOSITION LAYER PROPOSED BY THIS ARTICLE TO EXTRACT THE TENSOR ELEMENTS AND STRUCTURAL INFORMATION OF THE ORIGINAL TENSOR WHICH CAN BEST REPRESENT USERS' INTENTION OF LEGAL CONSULTATION, NAMELY THE CORE TENSOR. THE CORE TENSOR RELIES LESS ON THE LEXICAL AND SEMANTIC INFORMATION OF THE ORIGINAL USERS' LEGAL CONSULTING STATEMENTS DATA, IT REDUCES THE DIMENSION OF THE ORIGINAL TENSOR, AND GREATLY REDUCES THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THE SUBSEQUENT BI-LSTM ALGORITHM. FURTHERMORE, WE USE A LARGE NUMBER OF CORE TENSORS OBTAINED BY THE TENSOR DECOMPOSITION LAYER WITH USERS' LEGAL CONSULTING STATEMENTS TENSORS AS INPUTS TO CONTINUOUSLY TRAIN BI-LSTM, AND FINALLY DERIVE THE USERS' LEGAL CONSULTATION INTENTION CLASSIFICATION MODEL WHICH CAN COMPREHENSIVELY UNDERSTAND THE USER'S LEGAL CONSULTATION INTENTION. EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD HAS FASTER CONVERGENCE SPEED AND HIGHER ACCURACY THAN TRADITIONAL RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS.
53	INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE VIOLENCE WAS AN INSEPARABLE ELEMENT OF THE EXERCISE OF POWER BY THE THIRD REICH IN THE OCCUPIED LANDS IN EAST-CENTRAL EUROPE, BOTH IN RELATION TO THE JEWISH POPULATION AND OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. DESPITE THE THAT THE REICH'S LEADERSHIP TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT TO CREATE AN ILLUSION ABOUT THE OCCUPATION ORDER HAVING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE APPLIED TO THE SUBJUGATED POPULATIONS AND THE JEWS IN PARTICULAR MEANT THAT ANY CIVILIZATIONAL AND CULTURAL NORMS WERE BROKEN ALL THE TIME AND THE BRUTALIZATION OF DAILY LIFE PROCEEDED UNABATED. VIOLENCE BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SYSTEM OF EXERCISING POWER, DIRECTING AND DRIVING THE GERMAN OCCUPIER'S POLICY TOWARD THE JEWISH POPULATION AT ALL DECISION-MAKING LEVELS. WITH ITS HELP THE GERMAN NATIONAL SOCIALISTS WERE BUILDING A NEW SYSTEM OF MORAL REFERENCES, JUSTIFYING THE TREATMENT OF THE HATED MINORITY IN A MANNER FAR EXCEEDING THE RULES OF LIVE IN A SOCIETY UPHELD SO FAR. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PERPETRATORS THEMSELVES THIS SYSTEM MADE IT POSSIBLE TO FIND EVER FURTHER REACHING RATIONALE OF THEIR OWN ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT POLICY, AND IT CONVINCED THEM ABOUT ITS INDISPENSABILITY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE NAZI UTOPIA. THE USE OF MASSIVE VIOLENCE ULTIMATELY BECAME A SINE QUA NON OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UTOPIAN FINAL SOLUTION OF THE "JEWISH QUESTION" THROUGH GENOCIDE. THIS WAS A FACTOR SHAPING A NEW SYSTEM OF MORAL VALUES, CEMENTING THE SENSE OF CO-DEPENDENCE OF THE PERPETRATORS IN A PECULIARLY DEFINED "COMMUNITY OF CRIME," A VESSEL MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO TRANSFORM UTOPIAN GOALS OF THE STATE INTO VERY TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROFITS. WITHOUT THE DAILY USE OF VIOLENCE THAT OVERCAME THE STILL EXISTING PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIERS AND SUPPRESSED ANY INTERNAL RESISTANCE THE HOLOCAUST JUST COULD NOT OCCUR IN THE FIRST PLACE.
54	THE AUTHOR TAKES A GENERAL DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH TO THE SYSTEM OF JURISDICTIONAL REVIEW OF DECISIONS CONCERNING ACCESS TO OFFICIAL INFORMATION IN LATIN AMERICA, WITH THE AIM OF ENABLING A FUTURE COMPARATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW STUDY ON INFORMATION ACCESS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE FIRST TWO TOPICS ARE RELATED TO AN OVERVIEW OF THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION ACCESS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CORRESPONDING LAWS, WITH IMPRECISE RULES THAT LEAD TO BEHAVIOR BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW OF DUBIOUS EFFECTIVENESS, SO THAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE VERGING ON A STATE OF IMMUNITY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE THIRD PART IS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA UP TO THE PRESENT DAY, JURISDICTIONAL REVIEW (JUDICIAL AND NON-JUDICIAL) OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF THEIR FORMAL LEGALITY BUT, ABOVE ALL, THEIR SUBSTANTIVE LEGALITY, I.E., A REVIEW OF THE CONTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE DISCRETIONARY ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS AND MARGIN OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPRECIATION. THE FOURTH TOPIC, THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE, INFLUENCED BY THE USA, IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF LATIN AMERICAN INFORMATION ACCESS LAW, IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN TRADITION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE FIFTH AND FINAL POINT CONCERNS THE MODELS OF JURISDICTIONAL REVIEW OF DECISIONS ON INFORMATION ACCESS WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THE OAS (ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES) AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. AMONG OTHER CONCLUSIONS, THE AUTHOR STATES THAT THE SEARCH FOR AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION ACCESS SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEPEND ON OPTING FOR A MODEL ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN BRAZIL, LATIN AMERICA, THE USA OR EUROPE; WHAT IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IS TO PROVIDE THE INTERESTED PARTIES WITH ACCESS TO A FAIR TRIAL GUARANTEEING THEIR RIGHT TO INFORMATION ACCESS EXCEPT IN CASES IN WHICH SECRECY IS NECESSARY AND JUSTIFIED ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CRITERIA.
55	JAPAN'S STRATEGIC THINKING HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THREE MAIN FACTORS: A FEAR OF ISOLATION, CALCULATION OF THE GEOPOLITICAL STRENGTH OF CHINA (AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, KOREA), AND ACCOMMODATION TO THE PREVAILING INTERNATIONAL POWER STRUCTURE. DURING THE COLD WAR JAPAN ALIGNED WITH WASHINGTON, BUT MAINTAINED SUFFICIENT DISTANCE TO EXPLORE A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA BASED ON JAPAN'S DOMINANT ECONOMIC POSITION. AS CHINESE POWER HAS GROWN AND JAPAN'S OWN ECONOMIC TOOLS FOR STATECRAFT HAVE SLOWED, TOKYO HAS MOVED CLOSER TO THE UNITED STATES TO BALANCE CHINESE POWER. JAPAN HAS ALSO HAD TO SEEK NEW WAYS TO SHAPE THE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IN ASIA, TURNING TO MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY SUCH AS THE CHANGMAI INITIATIVE. WHERE JAPAN'S DIPLOMACY IN ASIA IN THE 1980S AND 1990S EMPHASIZED JAPAN'S UNIQUE ABILITY TO CHAMPION "ASIAN" VALUES WITH THE WEST, INCREASINGLY TOKYO HAS EMPHASIZED ITS UNIQUE ABILITY TO CHAMPION UNIVERSAL VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN ASIA. THIS THEME HAS BEEN USED BY CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE JAPAN'S BRAND OVER CHINA, BUT ALSO BUILDS ON A TRADITION OF JAPANESE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO TAKE A LEAD IN RULE-MAKING IN THE REGION. PRIME MINISTER KOIZUMI'S ASSERTIVE FOREIGN POLICY HELPED TO REINVIGORATE JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL POSITION, BUT HE MOVED FROM THE TRADITIONAL THREE PART FORMULATION OF JAPAN'S ORIENTATION - THE U.S. ALLIANCE, THE UN SYSTEM AND ASIA - TO A SIMPLER TWO PART FORMULATION OF "THE U.S.-JAPAN ALLIANCE AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION." THE LACK OF FOCUS ON ASIA HAS CONTRIBUTED TO GROWING TENSIONS WITH SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA OVER HISTORY ISSUES, EVEN AS JAPAN'S GLOBAL AND BROADER REGIONAL STANDING HAS INCREASED ACCORDING TO MOST OPINION POLLS. THESE REGIONAL CHALLENGES WILL CONTINUE TO CONFRONT FUTURE PRIME MINISTERS WELL PAST KOIZUMI.
56	THE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION OF LAW IS TO INHERENTLY AND POSITIVELY STANDARDIZE AND INSTITUTIONALIZE CORE IDEOLOGIES AND VALUES BY DIRECTLY AFFECTING THOSE IDEOLOGIES, INCORPORATING THE OUTLOOK ON VALUES, ETHICS, LIFE AND HONOR AND DISGRACE. THE PURPOSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE REVISION PLAN OF INTEGRATING THE CORE SOCIALIST VALUES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF RULE OF LAW, ADOPTED BY CHINA'S CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN 2018, IS TO COMPREHENSIVELY STRENGTHEN THE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION OF LAW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE SOCIALIST CORE VALUES WITHIN THE ENTIRE SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM, TO CONSOLIDATE A SOLID SOCIALIST IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION, AND TO IMPROVE IDEOLOGY AND ETHICS ACROSS CHINA. AS A FAMILY IS THE CELL OF A SOCIETY AND THE FIRST CLASSROOM OF LIFE, FAMILY VALUE IS NOT ONLY AT THE CORE OF A FAMILY BUT ALSO AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A SOCIETY. THE LEGAL SYSTEM RELATING TO FAMILY PROPERTY, BASED ON THE FAMILY PROPERTY SYSTEM AND SPOUSAL INHERITANCE RIGHT, CAN RATIONALLY ADJUST THE FAMILY PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP; THIS SYSTEM CAN COMBINE, CULTIVATE AND CARRY FORWARD SOCIALIST CORE VALUES, GUIDE AND CULTIVATE ETHICS, AND PROMOTE FAMILY VALUES, FAMILY CULTURE AND FAMILY TRADITIONS. MOREOVER, IT CAN EDUCATE PEOPLE TO FORMULATE AN APPROPRIATE OUTLOOK ON LIFE, VALUES AND MONEY AND SENSE OF HONOR. TODAY, THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF FAMILY PROPERTY, SUCH AS THE JOINT POSSESSION OF MARITAL INCOMES AND THE UNLIMITED RIGHT TO SPOUSAL INHERITANCE, HAS SHOWN A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION, SINCE IT WAS BORN DURING THE PERIOD OF THE RELATIVE SHORTAGE OF FAMILY PROPERTY IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, THE CIVIL CODE SHOULD FOLLOW THE SOCIALIST CORE VALUES, AND UPDATE AND INNOVATE THE FAMILY PROPERTY LEGAL SYSTEM AND THEREBY PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PATH TO RECTIFY THE HITHERTO NEGATIVE EFFECT ON EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION OF THE FAMILY PROPERTY LEGAL SYSTEM.
57	DISINFORMATION REGARDING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON. IT CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO THE VALUES PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW, HEALTH IN PARTICULAR. THE PRIMARY ISSUE TACKLED IN "DISINFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 IN THE LIGHT OF PRIORITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE LEGAL REGULATIONS BINDING AND CURRENTLY DRAFTED IN POLAND" PAPER IS AN ATTEMPT AT ANSWERING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: IS ELIMINATING COVID-19 DISINFORMATION FROM PUBLIC SPACE POSSIBLE IN LIGHT OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE LEGAL REGULATIONS ALREADY EFFECTIVE AND CURRENTLY BEING DRAFTED IN POLAND? THE ANALYSES CONDUCTED UNDER THE PAPER LEAD TO THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE PROVISIONS CURRENTLY REGULATING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION THEORETICALLY CONSTITUTE A BASIS FOR ELIMINATING DISINFORMATION FROM PUBLIC SPACE BUT ARE, IN PRACTICE, NOT VERY EFFECTIVE. THIS LEADS TO THE NEED FOR SEARCHING FOR OTHER, MORE EFFECTIVE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS IN THIS FIELD, BOTH ON THE LEVEL OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW MAKING AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. ALTHOUGH WE MAY SPEAK OF A CONSENSUS CONCERNING ASSESSMENT OF THE VERY PHENOMENON OF DISINFORMATION THE LEGISLATIVE AND PRACTICAL ACTIONS TAKEN, BOTH ON THE DOMESTIC LEVEL AND THE EUROPEAN UNION LEVEL, ENABLE US TO INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL AND FREQUENTLY DISTURBING DIFFERENCES REGARDING SHIFTING THE ASPECTS EMPHASIZED BY LEGISLATION. AS COMPARED TO THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS DRAFTED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE DRAFTS OF DOMESTIC ACTS, THE VASTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE IDEA OF CONTROLLING DISINFORMATION IS CLEARLY VISIBLE. THEREFORE, IT MUST BE STATED THAT SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WILL LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF VARIED LEGAL EFFECTS OF THE DRAFTED REGULATIONS THAT WILL DECIDE, AMONG OTHER ISSUES, THE PRACTICAL EFFECTIVENESS OR LACK THEREOF IN THE CASE OF THE DRAFTED SOLUTIONS. IN THE COURSE OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUE CONSTITUTING THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER WE SHOULD CONCURRENTLY BEAR IN MIND THAT FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW.
58	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAW, JUSTICE AND VISUAL CULTURE OF FASCIST REGIME. THE QUESTION TO WHICH WE WOULD LIKE TO GIVE SOME (PROVISIONAL) ANSWERS IS WHETHER AND HOW FASCISM CONCEIVED AND ELABORATED AN AESTHETIC OF LAW AND JUSTICE CAPABLE OF POSSESSING ELEMENTS OF CONSISTENCY, ORIGINALITY AND AUTONOMY. HOW DID FASCISM THEN VISUALLY REPRESENT LAW AND JUSTICE? WAS THERE A 'REAL' POLICY AIMED AT INFORMING THE AESTHETIC COMMUNICATION OF THAT "SET OF SYMBOLS, ALLEGORIES, ICONS AND STORIES" THAT ARE FULLY PART OF THE LEGAL DISCOURSE IN A GIVEN ERA? WHICH ARTISTIC AND SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE MOST CONTRIBUTED TO 'STAGING' THE NORMATIVE DIMENSION OF FASCISM BY REFLECTING AND AT THE SAME TIME CONDITIONING THE CONDUCT AND PERCEPTIONS OF LAW? THE FASCIST STATE ASPIRED TO BE - AS MUSSOLINI SAID IN 1932 ON THE OCCASION OF THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEIZURE OF POWER - A "STRONG STATE" BUT ALSO A "STATE OF JUSTICE". IT SUPPRESSED POLITICAL DISSENT BUT ASPIRED TO BE A "REGIME OF JUSTICE" SERVING TO BUILD UP CONSENSUS IN THE NEW DIMENSION OF THE "ETHICAL STATE". THE RULE OF LAW WAS SERIOUSLY UNDERMINED (IF NOT DESTROYED) BY THE AUTHORITARIAN TURN BUT FASCISM PURSUED ALSO THE IDEA THAT LAW AND JUSTICE MIGHT HELP TO MOULD THE "NEW ITALIANS". NEW LAWS AND CODES WERE INTENDED TO PLAY THEIR PART IN FORGING THE NEW "FASCIST MAN", BUT THIS AIM WAS RENDERED MORE VISIBLE THROUGH ARCHITECTURE AND VISUAL ARTS, INTRODUCING AS THEY DID THE APPROPRIATE SYMBOLS AND REPRESENTATIONS. THE MOST IMPORTANT 'MANIFESTO' OF FASCIST VISUAL CULTURE ON LAW AND JUSTICE WAS DOUBTLESS THE HUGE PALACE OF JUSTICE BUILT IN MILAN IN THE THIRTIES. IN THIS ESSAY WE TAKE SOME EXAMPLES TO SHOW HOW IMAGES AND AESTHETICS DID CONTRIBUTE TO CREATE A COMPLEX AND CONTRADICTORY DISCOURSE.
59	WHEREAS CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, TODAY, THEY THESE COURTS EXIST IN NONDEMOCRACIES, WHERE THEY FACE DIRECT THREATS TO THEIR EXISTENCE OR BACKLASH FROM DOMESTIC ACTORS. FOR A COURT TO SURVIVE, IT HAS TO CONSTANTLY STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE RULER AND TRYING NOT TO LOSE ITS LEGITIMACY. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IN NONDEMOCRACIES? WHEN DO THEY RULE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, AND WHEN DO THEY SIDE WITH IT? TO WHAT EXTENT CAN REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS, CITIZENS, OR POLITICAL ACTIVISTS SUCCEED IN CHALLENGING THE STATE? GIVEN THE HIGHER RISKS JUDGES IN NONDEMOCRACIES FACE, WHEN DO THEY AUTHOR DISSENTING OPINIONS? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, I USE A NOVEL DATASET ON ALL FINAL JUDGMENTS ISSUED BY THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (RCC) BETWEEN 1998 AND 2018 (N = 502). USING A REGRESSION ANALYSIS, I SHOW HOW THE OUTCOMES OF CASES DEPEND ON WHO PETITIONS THE COURT AND ABOUT WHAT. FIRST, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE POLITICAL REGIME AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS MATTER-APPLICATIONS ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S STRUCTURE HAVE THE LOWEST PROBABILITIES OF BEING NULLIFIED BUT HAVE HIGHER PROBABILITIES OF CARRYING A DISSENTING OPINION. ADDITIONALLY, JUDGES DISSENT MORE WHEN CASES ARE BROUGHT BY HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL ACTORS, SUCH AS THE PRESIDENT, FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, AND GOVERNMENT. SECOND, SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE AN AREA OF CONSENSUS AMONG JUDGES-THE COURT IS MORE LIKELY TO STRIKE DOWN LAWS THAT VIOLATE SOCIAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL WELFARE AND CASES ON ANTIDISCRIMINATION, AND JUDGES ARE LESS LIKELY TO DISSENT IN SUCH CASES. WHEN HIGHER COURTS IN NONDEMOCRACIES EXIST-AND AS LONG AS THEY BENEFIT THE RULER OR RULING PARTY-THEY TEND TO (1) AVOID CONFRONTATION WITH THE RULER AND (2) SHIFT THEIR FOCUS TOWARD "SAFER" AREAS, WHICH, IN THE RUSSIAN CASE, BECAME ADVANCING AND PROTECTING SOCIAL RIGHTS.
60	CHOICES ABOUT CRIMINAL LAW AND PUNISHMENT HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROCEDURAL RULES. SOME CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RULES ARE RECOGNIZED AS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, OR FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THEY ARE CONSTITUTIVE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND SHOULD HOLD REGARDLESS OF CHANGES IN SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW. OTHERS ARE MERELY INSTRUMENTAL; OTHER PROCEDURES COULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING JUST AS WELL. BUT A THIRD TYPE OF PROCEDURAL RULE IS REQUIRED OR HIGHLY FAVORED BY A JURISDICTION'S CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO DEFINE ITS CRIMINAL LAW AND ITS PUNISHMENT POLICIES. THESE RULES CAN BE CRITICAL TO LEGITIMACY BECAUSE CHOICES ABOUT CRIME DEFINITIONS AND PUNISHMENT POLICIES HAVE MADE THEM NECESSARY FOR LEGITIMATE IMPLEMENTATION OF CRIMINAL LAW. IN THIS WAY, SUBSTANTIVE LAW AND PROCEDURE ARE INTERDEPENDENT: A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF CRIMINAL LAW REQUIRES CORRESPONDING PROCEDURAL FEATURES AND IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH OTHERS. LIKEWISE, SOME PROCEDURAL INSTITUTIONS REFLECT A SPECIFIC THEORY OF CRIMINAL LAW OR PUNISHMENT. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THIS SUBSTANCE-PROCEDURE INTERDEPENDENCE BY FOCUSING ON RULES OF CHARGING AND SENTENCING AUTHORITY. CHARGING-AUTHORITY RULES EITHER GRANT PROSECUTORS WIDE DISCRETION IN DECIDING WHETHER TO CHARGE ACTORS WHOSE GUILT THEY CAN PROVE, OR PROHIBIT SUCH DISCRETION BY IMPOSING A MANDATORY PROSECUTION DUTY. SENTENCING-AUTHORITY RULES EITHER GIVE JUDGES DISCRETION TO FIX A SENTENCE WITHIN AN AUTHORIZED RANGE OR BAR SUCH DISCRETION BY MANDATING SPECIFIC PUNISHMENTS FOR PARTICULAR OFFENSES. WHEN LEGISLATURES FAIL TO DEFINE CRIMINAL LIABILITY CRITERIA PRECISELY ENOUGH TO MATCH INDIVIDUAL MORAL CULPABILITY-AS THEY SOMETIMES DELIBERATELY DO, AND AS MANY THINK IS SOMETIMES INEVITABLE-PROCEDURAL DISCRETION IS THE NECESSARY MEANS TO KEEP CRIMINAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ACCORD WITH CRIMINAL LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF THIS REMEDY FOR FAILURES OF SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW AS WELL AS THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR ADOPTING THE ALTERNATIVE, MANDATORY PROSECUTION RULE.
61	PROPORTIONALITY, ACCEPTED AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW BY MANY COUNTRIES, REQUIRES THAT GOVERNMENT INTRUSIONS ON FREEDOMS BE JUSTIFIED, THAT GREATER INTRUSIONS HAVE STRONGER JUSTIFICATIONS, AND THAT PUNISHMENTS REFLECT THE RELATIVE SEVERITY OF THE OFFENSE. PROPORTIONALITY AS' A DOCTRINE DEVELOPED BY COURTS, AS IN CANADA, HAS PROVIDED A STABLE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK, PROMOTING STRUCTURED, TRANSPARENT DECISIONS EVEN ABOUT CLOSELY CONTESTED CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. OTHER BENEFITS OF PROPORTIONALITY INCLUDE ITS POTENTIAL TO BRING CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CLOSER TO CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE, TO PROVIDE A COMMON DISCOURSE ABOUT RIGHTS FOR ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, AND TO HELP IDENTIFY THE KINDS OF FAILURES IN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WARRANTING HEIGHTENED JUDICIAL SCRUTINY. EARLIER U.S. DEBATES OVER "BALANCING" WERE NOT INFORMED BY RECENT COMPARATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH STRUCTURED PROPORTIONALITY DOCTRINE AND ITS BENEFITS. MANY AREAS OF U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW INCLUDE SOME ELEMENTS OF WHAT IS ELSEWHERE CALLED PROPORTIONALITY ANALYSIS. I ARGUE HERE FOR GREATER USE OF PROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLES AND DOCTRINE; I ALSO ARGUE THAT PROPORTIONALITY REVIEW IS NOT THE ANSWER TO ALL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS QUESTIONS. FREE SPEECH CAN BENEFIT FROM CATEGORICAL PRESUMPTIONS, BUT IN THEIR APPLICATION AND DESIGN PROPORTIONALITY MAY BE RELEVANT. THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, WHICH SECURES A "RIGHT" AGAINST "UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZUIES," IS REPLETE WITH CATEGORICAL RULES PROTECTING POLICE CONDUCT FROM JUDICIAL REVIEW; MORE CASE-BY-CASE ANALYSIS OF THE "UNREASONABLENESS" OR DISPROPORTIONALITY OF POLICE CONDUCT WOULD BETTER PROTECT RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. "DISPARATE IMPACT" EQUALITY CLAIMS MIGHT BE BETTER ADDRESSED THROUGH MORE PROPORTIONATE REVIEW STANDARDS; EIGHTH AMENDMENT REVIEW OF PRISON SENTENCES WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE USE OF PROPORTIONALITY PRINCIPLES. RECOGNIZING PROPORTIONALITY'S ADVANTAGES, AND LIMITS, WOULD BETTER ENABLE U.S. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TO AT ONCE PROTECT RIGHTS AND FACILITATE EFFECTIVE DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNANCE.
62	AFTER DECADES OF RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION IN WORLD AFFAIRS, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND LEGALITY HAVE REGAINED SCHOLARLY IMPERATIVE. YET THIS HAS NOT DISSOLVED DISCIPLINARITY BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW (IL) AND RELATIONS (IR), BUT FURTHERED A PRIORI THEORIZING AND THE UNILATERAL EXTENSION OF DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AGENDAS. A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE INFLUENTIAL LEGALIZATION AGENDA' OF IR SCHOLARSHIP, WHERE AN INSTITUTIONALIST DOCTRINE HAS RENARRATED THE L WORD' THROUGH A FETISHIZING OF RULES AND A MANAGERIAL FOCUS ON RULE COMPLIANCE. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH CONFRONTS A PROBLEM OF RELEVANCE AS INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLES INCREASINGLY INVOLVE CONTESTS OVER HOW TO LEGALLY CHARACTERIZE ISSUES, ACTIONS, AND EVENTS, AND THIS ENGAGES JURIDICAL AND NORMATIVE DIMENSIONS OF RULE APPLICATION WHICH ARE BEYOND THE MANAGERIALISM OF COMPLIANCE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES FOR GREATER SOCIOLOGICAL AND CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE CONCEPT OF LAW OPERATES THROUGH JURIDICO-POLITICAL PRACTICES OF LEGALITY, AND THE AIM IS TO PROVIDE A THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL DISCUSSION THAT REVIVES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JURIDICO-POLITICAL WORLD FOR SCHOLARSHIPS WHICH HAVE HABITUALLY UNDERPLAYED THE CONSTITUTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF LAWYERING FOR RULE APPLICATION. TO DO SO, THIS ARTICLE, FIRST, ADDRESSES THE PROFUNDITY OF KANT'S WORK AND CONCERN OVER LAW'S APPLICATION BY A RULE-APPLIER AND, SECOND, CLAIMS THIS HAS LONG INVITED A MORE CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY. TO INITIATE THAT SOCIAL EXPLORATION, THE PAPER DRAWS ON BOTH PIERRE BOURDIEU'S CONCEPT OF THE JURIDICAL EFFECT' AND THE FOUCAULDIAN NOTION OF NORMATIVE LAW' TO THEORIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JURIDICAL AND NORMATIVE PRACTICES IN THE MAKING OF INTERNATIONAL LAW'S RULE. IN THE FINAL SECTION, I INTRODUCE THE EMPIRICAL BENEFIT OF THESE CRITICAL SOCIOLOGIES BY TURNING TO THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT (LOAC), AND THE WAYS JURIDICAL AND NORMATIVE POWER HAVE ENABLED SOPHISTICATED MILITARIES OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO CONSTRAIN THE APPLICATION OF THE LOAC IN CONTEMPORARY WARS OF ASYMMETRIC COMBAT.
63	ON MARCH 11, 2014 (BEIJING) AND MARCH 10, 2014 (BOSTON), SCHOLARS FROM CHINA AND THE U.S. ATTENDED THE INAUGURAL RENMIN UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL VIRTUAL WORKSHOP (RUIVW). A NEW PLATFORM FOR SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION, RUIVW TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET VIDEOCONFERENCE TECHNOLOGY TO CONVENE SCHOLARS FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD TO DISCUSS PROFESSOR DUNCAN KENNEDY'S WORK, THREE GLOBALIZATIONS OF LAW AND LEGAL THOUGHT: 1850-2000. PROFESSOR DUNCAN KENNEDY'S SEMINAL WORK ON THE GLOBALIZATION OF LAW AND LEGAL THOUGHT WAS INTRODUCED TO CHINA IN 2009, WHEN GAO HONGJUN, A CHINESE LEGAL PHILOSOPHER, TOOK ON THE TASK OF TRANSLATING IT INTO CHINESE. 1 THE ARTICLE (HEREINAFTER "THREE GLOBALIZATIONS") HAS SINCE BEEN TREATED SERIOUSLY BY THE CHINESE LEGAL ACADEMIA, WITH PROMINENT FIGURES SUCH AS PROFESSOR GAO DISCUSSING THE WORK IN DEPTH AND A NUMBER OF DOCTORAL THESES DEVOTED TO ANALYZING ITS CORE IDEAS. 2 RUIVW WAS YET ANOTHER OCCASION FOR CHINESE SCHOLARS TO ENGAGE ITS IDEAS AND TRY TO BRING ITS INSIGHTS TO THE CHINESE CONTEXT. THE PARTICIPANTS OF RUIVW ON THE CHINESE SIDE ARE ACCOMPLISHED JURISTS AND PROMISING YOUNG SCHOLARS IN JURISPRUDENCE, PRIVATE LAW AND PUBLIC LAW. ON THE AMERICAN SIDE, PROFESSOR WILLIAM ALFORD IS A LEADING SCHOLAR IN COMPARATIVE LAW AND A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF THE CHINESE LEGAL ACADEMIA. PROFESSOR KENNEDY IS AN EMINENT FIGURE IN JURISPRUDENCE AND FOUNDER OF CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES (CLS). THE DOCTOR OF JURIDICAL SCIENCE (S.J.D.) CANDIDATES FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL AND PROFESSOR SHEN YUANYUAN, A LEGAL SCHOLAR TEACHING AT BOSTON COLLEGE OF LAW AND ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY, ATTENDED THE WORKSHOP AS WELL. THE WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED ISSUES SUCH AS LEGAL TRANSPLANTATION, THE GLOBALIZATION OF LEGAL THOUGHT, THE RULE OF LAW, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE EVOLUTION OF LEGAL NORMS, ETC. IT WAS A FRUITFUL AND ENLIGHTENING EXPERIENCE FOR ALL THE PARTICIPANTS. THE FOLLOWING IS THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE FIRST RUIVIW SESSION.
64	COMMUNITY MEDIATION IN CHINA HAS A LONG HISTORY AND FINDS ITS ROOTS IN BOTH CULTURAL (TRADITIONAL CONFUCIAN IDEOLOGIES) AND FUNCTIONAL (THE AVOIDANCE OF SOCIAL CONFLICTS) AIMS. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, OWING TO CHANGES IN SOCIETAL VALUES OCCURRING ALONGSIDE CHINA'S ECONOMIC OPEN-DOOR POLICY, TRADITIONAL VALUES ARE LOSING THEIR PROMINENT ROLE IN THE MEDIATION PROCESS. MEANWHILE, REFORMS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT TO PROVIDE GREATER STRUCTURE TO COMMUNITY MEDIATION IN CHINA. THE COMBINATION OF THESE CHANGES HAS RESULTED IN STRUGGLES TO REDEFINE THE PLACE AND ROLE OF MEDIATION IN CHINA. WHILE THE FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS OF MEDIATION ALLOWS A CONTEXTUALIZED AND 'LEARNING MODE OF LEGAL INTERVENTION', IT IS AT RISK OF BEING A 'PRECARIOUS IDEAL' THAT LACKS PRECISION. NEVERTHELESS, EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A NEW VERSION OF MEDIATION WHICH IS EMBEDDED IN THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS EMERGING AND THAT RESPONSES FROM MEDIATORS IN RELATION TO THIS NEW MODE OF MEDIATION ARE POSITIVE, REPORTING ENHANCEMENT IN BOTH OBJECTIVITY AND LEGITIMACY. THIS PAPER SEEKS TO EXPLORE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF ACHIEVING RESPONSIVE MEDIATION IN ACTION IN CHINA. DRAWING ON A SET OF INTERVIEWS AND A CASE STUDY CONDUCTED IN THREE CITIES IN CHINA, THE PAPER AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL PLURALISM DISCOURSE BY EXAMINING HOW MEDIATION IN CHINA, TRADITIONALLY AN 'UNOFFICIAL' FORM OF LEGAL PRACTICE IS NOW BECOMING 'OFFICIAL' THROUGH STATE SANCTION AND HOW MEDIATORS INTERACT WITH TRADITIONAL CONFUCIAN NORMATIVE ORDERS IN THE CONTEXT OF CHANGING SOCIAL PRIORITIES AND VALUES. THIS PAPER IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: PART I DISCUSSES BRIEFLY THE JURISPRUDENCE OF RESPONSIVE LAW; PART II EXAMINES CONTEMPORARY MEDIATION POLICY IN CHINA WHICH ECHOES IN MANY RESPECTS THE GOALS AND CHALLENGES OF RESPONSIVE LAW AND PART III PROVIDES AN EMPIRICAL EXPLORATION OF THE CHALLENGES OF APPLYING RESPONSIVE LAW IDEALS IN PRACTICE.
65	THE PAPER PRESENTS A MODEL TO DISCOVER THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE COLONIAL INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND TO EXPLAIN THE EMPIRICAL FINDING OF THE 'REVERSAL OF FORTUNE' OF ACEMOGLU ET AL. [Q. J. ECON. H 7 (2002) 1231], BASED ON AN EXTENDED VERSION OF THE 'ENDOWMENT THEORY'. REVERSAL OF FORTUNE IMPLIES THAT COUNTRIES AMONG THE FORMER EUROPEAN COLONIES THAT WERE LESS URBANIZED (RELATIVELY POOR) IN 1500 SHOULD BE RELATIVELY RICH TODAY. THE MODEL IS BASED ON THE KRUGMAN'S GEOGRAPHY MODEL. WE ADDITIONALLY ASSUME THAT TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS INCLUDING ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTIONS ARE POSSIBLE ONLY THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT OF ECONOMIC AGENTS FROM METRO TO COLONY. THE MODEL YIELDS THE FOLLOWING IMPLICATIONS. FIRST, VARIOUS LEGAL SYSTEMS DIFFERING IN THE LEVEL OF THE RULE OF LAW DO NOT AFFECT THE METRO AGENT'S DECISION OF SETTLEMENT OR EXTRACTION. SECOND, THE LESS URBANIZED IS THE COLONY, THE MORE LIKELY METRO FARMERS MIGRATE INTO THE COLONY, TRANSFERRING METRO TECHNOLOGIES AND INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE 'REVERSAL OF FORTUNE'. THIRD, THE MORE LIKELY THE COLONY WILL EXPERIENCE METRO AGENTS' MIGRATION (TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS) AND THE SUBSEQUENT COLONIAL INDUSTRIALIZATION WITH ITS LOWER MORTALITY RATE, WITH ITS HIGHER AVAILABILITY OF ARABLE LAND, OR WITH ITS SMALLER DISTANCE FROM THE METRO. LAST, IF THE DISTANCE IS LARGE ENOUGH, IT LEADS TO A DIFFERENT EQUILIBRIUM WHERE SUBSIDIARIES OF METRO FIRMS IN THE COLONY PRODUCE AND SUPPLY ALL KINDS OF THE MANUFACTURES GOODS TO THE COLONY IN A SELF-SUFFICIENT FASHION. THEN, ONLY THE MORTALITY RATE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ARABLE LAND MATTER, WHILE THE DISTANCE DOES NOT. THIS IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE CASE OF FORMER EUROPEAN COLONIES SUCH AS US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND OTHERS. (C) 2003 ELSEVIER SCIENCE B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
66	WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN CHINESE HOSPITALS HAS INCREASINGLY ATTRACTED WORLD ATTENTION. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CRIMINAL LITIGATION CASES ON WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN CHINESE HOSPITALS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL AND EXPLORE THE INFLUENCING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE. A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ANALYSE 507 CRIMINAL LITIGATION CASES ON WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN CHINESE HOSPITALS, WITH DATA EXTRACTED FROM THE CHINESE COURT WEBSITE. THE MULTIPLE ORDERED LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCING FACTORS ON THE SEVERITY OF WORKPLACE VIOLENCE. THE CRIMES AS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN THE HOSPITALS WERE CONCENTRATED IN EAST AND CENTRAL CHINA (53.9%). THE MOST COMMON CLINICAL SPECIALTY INVOLVED IN WORKPLACE VIOLENCE WAS GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS (27.8%). THE FIRST 4 TYPES OF CRIMES AS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN THE HOSPITALS WERE THE CRIME AS PICKING QUARRELS AND PROVOKING TROUBLE (26.0%), THE CRIME AS DISRUPTING PUBLIC SERVICE (20.7%), THE CRIME AS INTENTIONAL INJURY (19.1%), AND THE CRIME AS GATHERING PEOPLE TO DISTURB PUBLIC ORDER (15.2%). THE SEVERITY OF CRIMES AS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN THE HOSPITALS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCATION (OR = 2.569, P = .013), VICTIM TYPE (POLICEMEN OR SECURITY GUARDS) (OR = 0.495, P = .005), MORE THAN 3 VICTIMS (OR = 2.252, P = .035), PERPETRATORS (PATIENTS' FAMILY MEMBER) (OR = 0.491, P = .045), PREVIOUS ARREST (OR = 2.113, P = .024), PREMEDITATION (OR = 2.234, P = .004), AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS (OR = 1.911, P = .019). THE NUMBER OF THE CRIMES AS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN CHINESE HOSPITALS WAS SLIGHTLY DECLINING FROM 2014 TO 2020. THE SEVERITY OF CRIMES AS WORKPLACE VIOLENCE IN THE HOSPITALS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH SECONDARY HOSPITALS, MORE THAN 3 VICTIMS, VICTIM TYPE (POLICEMEN OR SECURITY GUARDS), PERPETRATORS (PATIENTS' FAMILY MEMBER), PREVIOUS ARREST, PREMEDITATION, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS.
67	THIS CONTRIBUTION DISCUSSES THE RECENT DUBOVETS CASE BEFORE BOTH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CHANGING DESIGN OF RUSSIAN PROPERTY LAW AS INCREASINGLY SHAPED BY INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES. COMMUNICATED IN DECEMBER 2016, THE APPLICATION IN DUBOVETS V. RUSSIA CONTINUES THE LINE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT'S CASES AGAINST RUSSIA ON THE PROTECTION OF GOOD FAITH PRIVATE OWNERS OF REAL ESTATE AGAINST PROPERTY CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT. PROMPTED BY THIS CASE LAW, THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN ITS JUDGMENT OF 22 JUNE 2017 NO 16-P STRUCK DOWN ARTICLE 302 OF THE RUSSIAN CIVIL CODE AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL INSOFAR AS IT ENTITLED THE GOVERNMENT TO RECLAIM POSSESSION OF STATE PROPERTY THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ALIENATED DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN NEGLIGENCE. THIS JUDGMENT MANIFESTS THE INCREASING INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LAW - OF CLASSICAL PROPERTY LAW, ON THE ONE HAND, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES, ON THE OTHER HAND. IT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO ONGOING EVOLUTION IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE'S PROPERTY RIGHTS IN RUSSIA: FROM THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF PUBLIC PROPERTY IN SOVIET TIMES - TO FORMAL EQUALITY BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE LANDMARK LEGAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE 1990S - AND NOW TO THE GROWING NEED FOR SPECIAL PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VIS-A-VIS THE STATE, IN LIGHT OF THE LATTER'S DOUBLE ROLE AS BOTH THE LARGEST OWNER AND THE (QUITE UNRESTRAINED) REGULATOR.
68	PURPOSE MOTIVATED BY THE CONFLICTING EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE MODERATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE LINK BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY USING A ROBUST PROXY IN MALAYSIA FROM 1984 TO 2017. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IS USED TO MEASURE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, WHILE FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS PROXIED USING THREE MEASURES (DOMESTIC CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR, DOMESTIC CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND DOMESTIC CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE BANKING SECTOR). AN INDEX OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS GENERATED FROM VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG BOUNDS TEST, FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE AND CANONICAL COINTEGRATING REGRESSION WERE USED AS THE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE SHORT RUN, WHEREAS TRADE OPENNESS AND NATURAL RESOURCES WORSEN IT. IN THE LONG RUN, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, TRADE OPENNESS AND NATURAL RESOURCES DETERIORATE THE ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, FINDINGS FROM THE INTERACTIVE TERM SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER TO AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE SHORT RUN. HOWEVER, INSTITUTIONS AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT PERFORM A SUBSTITUTABILITY ROLE IN INFLUENCING THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG RUN. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE TIME LAGS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IN MALAYSIA. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY OFFERS IMPORTANT POLICY IMPLICATIONS TO POLICYMAKERS IN MALAYSIA AND OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON HOW TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE MODERATING ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IN MALAYSIA. IT EXAMINES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, WHICH HAVE RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF MALAYSIA. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ARE ROBUST TO DIFFERENT PROXIES AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES.
69	THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL IS A CATALYSATOR OF THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TRY TO DEVELOP ATTRACTIVE CONDITIONS FOR HIGHLY QUALIFIED MIGRANTS TO DIFFUSE THE KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATIONS. THE AUTHORS PROVIDED THE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE PAPERS, WHICH FOCUSED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE MIGRANT ISSUES WAS DONE. FOR THE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS, THE METADATA OF 2 500 PAPERS WAS SELECTED FROM SCOPUS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBERS OF SCOPUS DOCUMENTS ON THE ALLOCATED THEME HAVE INCREASED FOR 2015 YEAR. THE MOST POWERFUL INVESTIGATIONS WERE PROVIDED BY SCIENTISTS FROM THE USA, CANADA, FRANCE, UNITED KINGDOM. THE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS FINDINGS CONFIRMED THAT THE SCIENTISTS ALLOCATED A VAST RANGE OF THE DETERMINANTS THAT COULD STIMULATE OR RESTRICT THE MIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY. THUS, THE GOVERNANCE EFFICIENCY HAD THE MEDIATION ROLE BETWEEN THE MIGRATION AND INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY. IN THIS CASE, THE PAPER AIMS TO CHECK THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE INCREASING (DECREASING) LEVEL OF COUNTRY INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY FROM YEAR T - 1 TO YEAR T POSITIVELY (NEGATIVELY) AFFECTS NET MIGRATION IN YEAR T + 1. THE PANEL DATA FOR 2011-2018 WAS GENERATED FROM INDEXMUNDI, EU DATA PORTAL, WORLDBANK. THE OBJECT OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS BULGARIA, CROATIA, LITHUANIA, LATVIA, POLAND, ROMANIA. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES NET MIGRATION RATE, THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES - WORLD GOVERNMENT INDICATORS: CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, REGULATORY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (FOR ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY), INNOVATION INDEX (FOR ASSESSMENT OF COUNTRY'S INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT). IN THE PAPER, TO CHECK THE HYPOTHESIS, THE AUTHORS USED THE FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE FOR HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS MODELS. THE FINDINGS CONFIRMED THAT INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE EFFICIENCY (POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, REGULATORY QUALITY, VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY) HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MIGRATION RATE. THE FINDINGS COULD BE USED TO IDENTIFY THE STRATEGIC GOALS OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT TO OVERCOME THE DEMOGRAPHIC ISSUES AND SUPPORT THE MIGRATION OF THE HIGH QUALIFIED WORKFORCES.
70	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO QUANTIFY THE LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES (PWD) IN INDONESIA AND COMPARES THEM TO PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. IT FIRST STUDIES THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION OF PWD BEFORE EXAMINING THE LARGE AND PERSISTENT WAGE GAPS THEY FACE. IT EXPLORES WHETHER THESE WAGE GAPS ARE EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCTIVITY, A DISTINCTION WHICH HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES ADDRESSING THESE GAPS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE INDONESIAN FAMILY LIFE SURVEY WAVE 5, WHICH INCLUDES UNIQUE QUESTIONS ALLOWING FOR SEVERAL DEFINITIONS OF DISABILITY. MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS USED TO STUDY DIFFERENCES IN TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT FOR PWD. WAGE GAPS ARE ESTIMATED AND CORRECTED FOR SELECTION USING PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING, SUPPORTED BY A HECKMAN SELECTION MODEL AND OAXACA-BLINDER DECOMPOSITION. COMPARISONS WITH OTHER PHYSICALLY DISADVANTAGED SUBGROUPS AND THE ANALYSIS OF HETEROGENEITY BY JOB REQUIREMENTS AND SECTOR OF WORK EXPLORE WHETHER PRODUCTIVITY GAPS HELP EXPLAIN WAGE GAPS. FINDINGS PWD GENERALLY HAVE LOWER UNCONDITIONAL LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, BUT DISPARITIES LARGELY DISAPPEAR WHEN CONTROLLING FOR CHARACTERISTICS. MOREOVER, PATTERNS VARY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE MEASURE OF DISABILITY USED DEPENDS ON PRIOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. PWD THAT DO NOT REQUIRE PRIOR DIAGNOSIS TEND TO WORK IN MORE VULNERABLE EMPLOYMENT. WHEN THEY ARE EMPLOYED FOR WAGES, PEOPLE WITH THESE TYPES OF DISABILITIES FACE LOWER WAGES, UP TO 22% LOWER. MEANWHILE, (SURPRISINGLY) THOSE WITH MEDICALLY DIAGNOSED CONDITIONS FACE NO DIFFERENCE OR A WAGE PREMIUM. THIS PAPER FINDS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT, WHERE A WAGE PENALTY EXISTS, A SUBSTANTIAL PART IS UNEXPLAINED BY OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE PREVIOUS LITERATURE ON DISABILITY HAS BEEN MOSTLY BASED ON STUDIES OF HIGH-INCOME ECONOMIES. THIS PAPER EXTENDS THE LITERATURE TO INDONESIA, WHICH DIFFERS FROM HIGH-INCOME CONTEXTS DUE TO LACK OF MENTAL HEALTHCARE RESOURCES AND ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS WEAKER RULE OF LAW. IT PROVIDES UNIQUE INSIGHTS BASED ON TYPES OF DISABILITY AND THE SALIENT DIMENSIONS OF DISABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE. IT ALSO PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT PRODUCTIVITY DIFFERENCES DO NOT EXPLAIN THE WAGE GAP.
71	COURT PROCEEDINGS SHOULD BE FAIR. ACCORDINGLY, THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF COURT PROCEEDINGS. EARLIER, THIS RIGHT WAS MAINLY INTERPRETED IN A NORMATIVE AND RATHER PASSIVE SENSE. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD HAS DEVELOPED TOWARDS THE REQUIREMENT OF ACTIVE AND FACTUAL PARTICIPATION OF COURT PARTIES ON EQUAL TERMS WITH THE OTHER PARTIES INVOLVED. THE EXPLANATION FOR THIS SHOULD BE SOUGHT IN MODERN (PROCEDURAL) LAW, WHICH IS MORE SOCIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED THAN HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE CASE. NOWADAYS FAIRNESS IS ALSO ABOUT FEELINGS. WELFARE IN COURTS MEANS NOT ONLY THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL SECURITY IN ITS TRADITIONAL FORM, BUT ALSO A GOOD ATMOSPHERE AND THE PRESENCE OF CONCRETE MEANS TO GIVE FAIR EXPERIENCES TO PEOPLE WHO VISIT COURTS. THIS PLACES COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION BETWEEN JUDGES AND PARTIES IN A CENTRAL POSITION AS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS FOR ACHIEVING A FAIR HEARING. WITH REGARD TO THE FORMULATION OF JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT COURT LAWYERS PUT THEMSELVES IN THE PARTIES' SITUATION AND GIVE CAREFUL DELIBERATION TO THE PURPOSE OF THEIR TEXTS AND HOW THEY WILL BE PERCEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE CONCERNED. THE MEDIA, TOO, HAS A KEY ROLE TO PLAY AS A COMMUNICATING LINK BETWEEN THE COURTS AND CITIZENS. FOR THE MEDIA TO BE ABLE TO GIVE AN ALL-ROUND AND BALANCED PICTURE OF THE COURTS, DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN COURTS MUST, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, BE OBSERVABLE, OR, IN OTHER WORDS, TRANSPARENT. THEREFORE, COURTS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF THROWING OPEN THEIR DOORS AND JUDGES NO LONGER TEND TO HIDE BEHIND THEIR LAW-BOOKS. POST-MODERN LEGAL DECISION-MAKING IS "DOING JUSTICE TOGETHER" RATHER THAN ISOLATED USE OF POWER. COURTS NEED TO FACE PEOPLE. AND TO DO THAT, THEY NEED TO MASTER THE MOST CRUCIAL INSTRUMENT OF ALL, NAMELY APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE USE. THE PRESENT ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW TO REALIZE/OPERATIONALIZE THIS "MODERN" FORM OF FAIRNESS IN COURTS AND HOW TO MAINTAIN IT WITH REFERENCE TO LEGAL THEORY AND PRACTICAL NEEDS.
72	THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES ARE CURRENTLY PLACED AT THE FOREFRONT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH EXISTING STUDIES HAVE LARGELY EXAMINED THE UNDERLYING FACTORS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THE ROLE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) STILL INSUFFICIENTLY INVESTIGATED. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO CLARIFY THE ROLE PLAYED BY INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND ICTS TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AT DIFFERENT SCALES OF THE ECOLOGICAL GAP. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND ICTS CONSOLIDATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY TO REDUCE THE ECOLOGICAL GAP AND THEREBY, PROMOTE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE RESULTS OF PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSION APPLIED TO FOURTEEN SELECTED MIDDLE EAST (ME) AND COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES (CIS) COUNTRIES FROM 1984 TO 2017 SHOWED THAT THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, INTERNET USE, AND MOBILE USE EXERT NO BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE ICTS AND THE INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE PRESENCE OF AN APPROPRIATE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION HAVE RATHER ADVANTAGEOUS MODERATING EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. INDEED, OUR FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE EFFECTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ARE POSITIVELY MODERATED BY THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, INTERNET USE, AND MOBILE USE FOR COUNTRIES WITH MEDIUM AND HIGH ECOLOGICAL GAPS. THE BENEFICIAL ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ARE ALSO MODERATED BY THE PRESENCE OF A SOLID REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, BUT ONLY FOR COUNTRIES WITH HIGH ECOLOGICAL GAPS. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROMOTES ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN COUNTRIES WITH LOW ECOLOGICAL GAPS. URBANIZATION HAS PERVERSE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT ACROSS ALL QUANTILES. THE RESULTS FOUND LEAD TO IMPORTANT PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT AS IT SUGGESTS DESIGNING ICTS AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS ORIENTED TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE ECOLOGICAL GAP. IN ADDITION, THE FINDINGS FROM THIS PAPER CAN SERVE DECISION-MAKERS IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY GIVEN THE GLOBALIZING AND CONDITIONAL APPROACH FOLLOWED.
73	IT HAS ESCAPED MANY PEOPLE'S ATTENTION THAT, JUST AS THE 1998 GFA RESCINDED THE CLAIM OF THE IRISH STATE ON THE 6 COUNTIES, IT ALSO GAVE UP ANY TERRITORIAL CLAIM BY THAT STATE ON THE REST OF THE ISLAND. IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE FAKE EXHILARATION OF THE CELTIC TIGER YEARS AND THE GENUINE RELIEF OF MANY IN THE NORTH OF IRELAND FINALLY HAVING A LIFE PUSHED CONSIDERATION OF THIS DOWN THE LIST OF PRIORITIES. YET IT IS PERHAPS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THIS DETERRITORIALIZATION EMERGED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH AN IRISH DEEP STATE, WITH BANKS, UNIVERSITIES AND INDEED PRIVATE MUSIC RIGHTS AGENCIES MADE EXEMPT FROM THE RULE OF LAW. MOREOVER, DETERRITORIALIZATION WAS A HALLMARK OF THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY AND THE RISKS OF ALIENATION, PREDICTED BY DELEUZE AS HE AUTHORED THE CONCEPT, WERE SEEN AS PERHAPS BALANCED BY "PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND PROGRESS". AS OF 2015, MORE IRISH CITIZENS HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE IN THE REPUBLIC SINCE THE 2008 CRASH THAN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS IN THE TROUBLES. WHILE THIS CAN INDEED BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANOMIE/ALIENATION, IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IN HIS CLASSIC PAPER ON THE SUBJECT DURKHEIM POINTED OUT THE VANISHINGLY LOW RATE OF SUICIDE IN HIS CONTEMPORARY IRELAND. THE STATUS QUO SEEMS UNTENABLE, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER HASSAN AHMED DEMONSTRATED IN OUR 2016 CONFERENCE THAT THE 1998 GFA COUPLED WITH THE 2004 REFERENDUM MEANS IRELAND IS IN BREACH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN NOT GRANTING NATIONALITY TO ALL BORN ON THE ISLAND. YET DETERRITORIALIZATION HAS HAD THE PARADOXICAL RESULT OF MAKING GAELIC CULTURE MORE PORTABLE THAN EVER, AND TO INCREASE ITS FOLLOWING BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. WHAT THIS PAPER PROPOSES IS RETERRITORIALIZING IRELAND BY PROVIDING A MECCA FOR THE TENS OF MILLIONS WHO VALUE THIS CULTURE. HERE WE LOOK AT WAYS OF RETERRITORIALIZING IRELAND FROM REINSTATING THE CLAIM ON THE WHOLE ISLAND TO EXPLICITLY REPUDIATING IT FOR A 26 OR 30 COUNTY STATE WITH EAST OF THE BANN LEFT IN THE NON-EU UK.
74	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ANTIMONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA IN RESPONSE TO ITS COMMITMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE AND TREATIES IN COMBATTING MONEY LAUNDERING.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SAUDI ANTIMONEY LAUNDERING MEASURES, THIS RESEARCH'S DATA HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY A QUALITATIVE APPROACH THAT USES A COMBINATION OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESOURCES. IT RELIES ON ANALYZING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LAW (AML) AND THE PROCESS OF MONEY LAUNDERING DETECTION IN SAUDI ARABIA IN RELATION TO THREE CASES FROM SAUDI COURTS SUPPORTED BY JOURNAL ARTICLES, ACADEMIC BOOKS AND RELIABLE WEBSITES.FINDINGS THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT THE SAUDI AML HAS BEEN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN THE BATTLE AGAINST MONEY LAUNDERING. THIS STUDY FINDS THAT THERE IS CLOSE COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION BETWEEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, BANKS AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES IN SAUDI ARABIA TO COMBAT THIS PHENOMENON. THIS STUDY ALSO CONCLUDES THAT THE AML IS COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER CRIMINAL LAWS SUCH AS THE ANTI-BRIBERY LAW, THE ANTI TRAFFICKING IN PERSON LAW AND THE ANTI-DRUG TRAFFICKING LAW.RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS PAPER RELIES MAINLY ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DETECTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEMES AND THE CONFISCATION OF PROCEEDS OF CRIME IN THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AS A MAIN SOURCE OF INFORMATION. THERE DATA AVAILABLE ON THE MONEY LAUNDERING CASES IN THE SAUDI PROSECUTION AND CRIMINAL COURTS WERE LIMITED DUE TO THE LACK OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF SUCH CASES BECAUSE OF THEIR SENSITIVITY. THIS WAS MADE UP FOR BY USING RELIABLE SOURCES IN WHICH SOME CASES WERE REPORTED.ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER UNDERLINES THE EFFICIENT ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT AML THAT CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING IN SAUDI ARABIA. THIS PAPER EMPHASIZES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN REGULATORY, FINANCIAL AND LAW OFFICERS TO IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW AND ACHIEVE JUSTICE.
75	POLICY POINTSSINCE ITS FOUNDING, THE SUPREME COURT HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN DEFINING THE PARAMETERS OF GOVERNMENTS' PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS AND THE SCOPE OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH-RELATED RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH CONSERVATIVE COURTS HAVE BEEN LESS FAVORABLE TO PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVES, FEDERAL COURTS HAVE, FOR THE MOST PART, ADVANCED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERESTS THROUGH CONSENSUS AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW.IN ESTABLISHING THE CURRENT SIX-THREE CONSERVATIVE SUPERMAJORITY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE SENATE SHIFTED THE SUPREME COURT DRAMATICALLY. A MAJORITY OF JUSTICES, LED BY CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, DID SHIFT THE COURT IN A DECIDEDLY CONSERVATIVE DIRECTION. IT DID SO INCREMENTALLY, GUIDED BY THE CHIEF'S INTUITION THAT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF SHOULD BE PRESERVED, MINDFUL OF MAINTAINING PUBLIC TRUST AND APPEARING OUTSIDE THE POLITICAL FRAY. THAT HAS ALL CHANGED BECAUSE ROBERTS' VOICE NO LONGER HOLDS SWAY. FIVE MEMBERS OF THE COURT HAVE DISPLAYED A WILLINGNESS TO OVERTURN EVEN LONG-HELD PRECEDENT AND DISMANTLE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY IN FAVOR OF THE JUSTICES' CORE IDEOLOGICAL TENANTS-NOTABLY THE EXTENSIVE REACH OF THE FIRST AND SECOND AMENDMENTS AND A PARSIMONIOUS VIEW OF EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION.PUBLIC HEALTH IS VULNERABLE TO JUDICIAL RULINGS IN THIS NEW CONSERVATIVE ERA. THIS INCLUDES CLASSIC PUBLIC HEALTH POWERS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL AS WELL AS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS; LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANS, QUEER OR QUESTIONING, AND OTHERS (LGBTQ+) RIGHTS; FIREARM SAFETY; IMMIGRATION; AND CLIMATE CHANGE.CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO CURB THE MOST EXTREME ACTIONS OF THE COURT WHILE STILL ADHERING TO THE VITAL IDEAL OF A NONPOLITICAL BRANCH. THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE CONGRESS ITSELF TO OVERREACH (SUCH AS BY "PACKING" THE SUPREME COURT, AS FRANKLIN DELAENO ROOSEVELT ONCE PROPOSED). CONGRESS COULD, HOWEVER, 1) DISEMPOWER LOWER FEDERAL JUDGES FROM ISSUING INJUNCTIONS THAT APPLY NATIONWIDE, 2) LIMIT THE SUPREME COURT'S SO-CALLED SHADOW DOCKET, 3) ALTER THE WAY THAT PRESIDENTS APPOINT FEDERAL JUDGES, AND 4) SET REASONABLE TERM LIMITS FOR FEDERAL JUDGES AND SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.
76	BACKGROUND THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC TAKES VARIABLE SHAPES AND FORMS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND COUNTRIES. THIS VARIABILITY IS EXPLAINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNANCE OF THE EPIDEMIC. WE AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE KEY ATTRIBUTES OF GOVERNANCE IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND GAIN LESSONS FOR AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. METHODS WE EMPLOYED A MIXED-METHODS DESIGN. WE MAPPED THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOVERNANCE FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS. A NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNANCE MEASURES ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE USED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ON COVID-19 CASES AND DEATHS IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. DOCUMENT REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE KEY APPROACHES AND ATTRIBUTES OF GOVERNANCE DURING THE PRE-VACCINE ERA OF THE RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE CONDUCTED A THEMATIC ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY KEY ATTRIBUTES FOR EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE. RESULTS THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNANCE MEASURES, INCLUDING GENERATION OF INTELLIGENCE, STRATEGIC DIRECTION, REGULATION, PARTNERSHIP, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, RULE OF LAW, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, RESPONSIVENESS, EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, ETHICS, AND INCLUSIVENESS, ARE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO AND CONTAIN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ADDITIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE WERE IDENTIFIED: 1) AGILE, ADAPTIVE, AND TRANSFORMATIVE GOVERNANCE; 2) COLLECTIVE (COLLABORATIVE, INCLUSIVE, COOPERATIVE, ACCOUNTABLE, AND TRANSPARENT) GOVERNANCE; 3) MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE; 4) SMART AND ETHICAL GOVERNANCE: SENSIBLE, PRAGMATIC, EVIDENCE-BASED, POLITICAL, LEARNER, AND ETHICAL. CONCLUSIONS THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTES ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO CONTAIN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE ARGUE THAT COUNTRIES NEED AGILE, ADAPTABLE, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL, COLLABORATIVE, MULTI-LEVEL, SMART AND ETHICAL GOVERNANCE TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO EMERGING AND RE-EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. IN ADDITION, AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON NATIONAL GOVERNANCE BUT ALSO ON GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. HENCE, GLOBAL HEALTH GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE URGENTLY RENEWED THROUGH A PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE AND HEALTH SECURITY TO ALL POPULATIONS AND IN ALL COUNTRIES. THIS REQUIRES ENHANCED AND CONSISTENT GLOBAL HEALTH DIPLOMACY BASED ON KNOWLEDGE, SOLIDARITY, AND NEGOTIATION.
77	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE CASE OF THE BOTANICAL GARDEN IN RIO DE JANEIRO, WHERE, OVER TIME, SETTLED AT THE COMMUNITY OF HORTO, THROUGH OCCUPATIONS CONSOLIDATED IN THE AREA OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE QUESTION IS PROSECUTED AND FROM CASES INITIATED IN THE 1980S (IN WHICH THE UNION ITSELF IS THE PLAINTIFF) WHO SOUGHT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RESIDENTS. IT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE MANAGEMENT POLICY OF BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT PROPERTIES IN THIS PERIOD, FOR A CONTINUOUS AND GRADUAL CHANGE OF VISION, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO AREAS THAT HAVE OCCUPATIONS CONSOLIDATED WITH HOUSING INSTALLED. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONAL ACTORS ENABLES A FOCUSED APPROACH TO THE PERCEPTION IN THE FIELD OF REALITY, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO HOUSING SHOULD ( OR CAN) MATERIALIZE AGAINST THE TRADITIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF LAWS. THE RESEARCH INVOLVES THE ANALYSIS OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INSTRUCTED WITHIN THE CHAMBER OF CONCILIATION OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, USING THE HISTORICAL-COMPARATIVE, CONCEPTUAL-DEDUCTIVE AND EMPIRICAL-INDUCTIVE METHODS. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE THE VALIDITY OF POLITICAL THEORY DEVELOPED BY AMERICAN COMMUNITARIAN CRITIQUE AND ITS SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOTIONS OF JUSTICE IN CONTEMPORARY DESIGN. WE WILL CONTEXTUALIZE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM FACED BY THE COMMUNITY OF HORTO, ITS HISTORY AND OUTLINE THE PROFILE OF THAT COMMUNITY, FROM THE EXPOSURE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC DATA OF THE PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THE PLACE. WE WILL EXAMINE THE PUBLIC POLICY OF MANAGING PROPERTIES OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, HIGHLIGHTING THE ROLE OF SPU ASSETS AND PARADIGMATIC CHANGES THAT MANAGEMENT PERCEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST TWO DECADES. WE WILL REVIEW THE ARGUMENTS OUTLINED IN A LAWSUIT POSSESSORY INDIVIDUAL - THE GRACINDA CASE - WHICH LED TO AN AUDIT BY THE COURT OF AUDIT, WHICH CULMINATED IN A DECISION RENDERED IN SEPTEMBER 2012, WHICH WILL ALSO BE OBJECT OF OUR ANALYSIS. LIES THE THEME, SO, BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SOCIAL FACT.
78	SINCE THE SYRIAN CONFLICT BROKE OUT, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF WESTERN CITIZENS TRAVELLED TO THE WARZONE TO JOIN THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA (ISIS). BY COMMON DEFINITIONS, SOME OF THE PERSONS TRAVELLED AS 'CHILDREN'. HOWEVER, SINCE THE DEFEAT OF ISIS, WESTERN COUNTRIES ARE FACING A CONUNDRUM ON HOW TO TREAT THESE YOUNG FORMER FIGHTERS. THE STATUS OF THESE CHILDREN HAS BEEN CONTENTIOUS. AMONG THE WESTERN COUNTRIES, THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A CLEAR POSITION OR CONSISTENT APPROACH ON HOW SUCH CHILDREN SHOULD BE TREATED. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE APPROACHES TOWARDS THE DILEMMA ON THESE YOUNG PERSONS HAVE, PREDOMINANTLY, BEEN DICTATED BY THE POLITICAL WHIMS OF INDIVIDUAL STATES. GENERALLY, THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS YOUNG 'TERRORISTS' LIKELY TO POSE DANGER TO WESTERN SOCIETIES IF REPATRIATED BACK. HOWEVER, THE PERCEPTIONS AND ACTIONS TOWARDS THESE MINORS SEEM TO DEPART FROM THE NORMATIVE APPROACHES TO CHILDREN ASSOCIATED WITH ARMED CONFLICT. THE WIDELY REPORTED CASE OF BRITISH TEENAGER SHAMIMA BEGUM SHONE THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE PREDICAMENTS OF CHILDREN FORMERLY ASSOCIATED WITH ISIS. THIS ARTICLE MAKES A CASE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ISIS-ASSOCIATED CHILDREN TO BE CONSIDERED AS CHILD SOLDIERS. WHEN ANALYSED CLOSELY, THESE CHILDREN DESERVE PROTECTIONS ACCORDED TO ALL CHILDREN RECRUITED FOR PURPOSES OF WARFARE. RECENT CASE LAW SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT SUCH PROTECTION DOES NOT CEASE EVEN AFTER THE AGE OF 18 YEARS. ALL CONSIDERED, THE DENIAL OF REPATRIATION APPEARS INIMICAL TO NORMATIVE STANDARDS ON CHILDREN ASSOCIATED WITH ARMED CONFLICT. FURTHERMORE, THE APPROACHES OF SOME OF THE WESTERN COUNTRIES COULD BE VULNERABLE TO CRITICISM FOR VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARBITRARY REVOCATION OF CITIZENSHIP AND BARRING OF RETURNS APPEAR STARKLY IN CONFLICT WITH NORMS OF NATURAL JUSTICE. WITH THIS IN MIND, THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT A CONSISTENT APPROACH WOULD REQUIRE THE WESTERN APPROACHES TO TREAT ISIS-ASSOCIATED CHILDREN AS VICTIMS FIRST AND ACCORD THEM PROTECTIONS RECOGNISED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW.
79	CONTRARY TO ITS PUBLIC RHETORIC PROMISING "JUSTICE FOR ALL" AND "EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW,"ACCESS TO CIVIL JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES IS "EXCEPTIONAL" ONLY IN A NEGATIVE SENSE. THE RULE OF LAW INDEX RANKS OUR NATION NEXT TO LAST AMONG THE WORLD'S THIRTY-ONE "RICHEST" COUNTRIES. A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS IS THAT MOST OF OUR FELLOW INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN CIVIL CASES AND INVEST FROM THREE TIMES TO TEN TIMES MORE THAN THE UNITED STATES ON CIVIL LEGAL AID. BEYOND THESE DIFFERENCES, THE UNITED STATES HAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM RESEARCH AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. STUDIES IN ENGLAND ABOUT HOW POOR AND MODERATE INCOME DEAL WITH THEIR JUSTICIABLE PROBLEMS SUGGEST THAT UNMET "EFFECTIVE DEMAND" FOR LAWYER SERVICES IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN UNMET "LEGAL NEEDS" RECORDED IN LEGAL NEEDS STUDIES-BECAUSE EVEN WITH A RIGHT TO COUNSEL MANY PEOPLE INSTEAD RESOLVED THEIR PROBLEMS IN OTHER WAYS. A STUDY IN CANADA FOUND THAT THOSE IN THE UPPER INCOME QUARTILE SPENT 167 TIMES MORE THAN THOSE IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE RESOLVING THEIR LEGAL PROBLEMS, EVEN THOUGH THEIR PROBLEMS OFTEN WERE LESS DISRUPTIVE THAN THOSE THE BOTTOM QUARTILE CONFRONTED. A SURVEY OF PAST AND PRESENT INNOVATIONS COVERS THE FOLLOWING: (1) BELGIUM'S PROBLEMATIC SYSTEM THAT ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL LAWYERS TO PROVIDE AS MUCH REPRESENTATION AS THEY CAN WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LIMITING WHAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY OUT FOR THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF LEGAL SERVICES RENDERED EACH YEAR; (2) DUTCH "LOKETS," A NATIONWIDE NETWORK OF OFFICES WHERE PEOPLE CAN RECEIVE ADVICE AND BRIEF ASSISTANCE FROM A PARALEGAL STAFF; (3) DUTCH "RECHTWIJZER 1.0 AND 2.0," ONLINE DISPUTE ASSISTANCE AND ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION; (4) ENGLISH "MCKENZIE FRIENDS" WHICH ALLOWS NONLAWYERS TO ACCOMPANY UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO THE COURTROOM AND RENDER LIMITED ASSISTANCE; AND (5) PARTIALLY SUBSIDIZED LAWYERS FOR THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASSES AND LEGAL EXPENSE INSURANCE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASSES FOUND IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
80	THE QUESTION ADDRESSED IN THIS PAPER CONCERNS A CRITICAL REFLECTION ABOUT THE REASONS FOR A LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DISCUSSING IT FROM THE THOUGHT CALLED BY SANTOS AS COUNTER-HEGEMONIC. THE INTEREST FOR REFLECTION ON THE FUNDAMENTADORA FAILURE OF THE LOGIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN ITS EUROCENTRIC CHARACTER ARISES IN THAT, ALTHOUGH THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ALREADY HAVE MADE IN WIDELY RESEARCHED SUBJECT, WHICH DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT DOES NOT DESERVE OTHER LOOKS, IN TURN ISSUES THE INEFFECTIVENESS WHEN THE NORMATIVE APPLICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE CAUSING FURTHER DEEPENING. THE PROPOSAL IS FROM A RETROSPECTIVE OF JUSFILOSOFICO AND POLITICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH WAS BORN THE NOTION OF "HUMAN RIGHTS", POINTING OUT ITS FOUNDATIONS, AND INHERENT IN ITS HISTORICAL EFFECTIVENESS ISSUES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE NATURAL LAW AND LEGAL POSITIVISM, RATIONAL MODERNITY, LOGICAL AND POSITIVIST IN A UNIVERSE DOMINATED BY THE RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO PROPOSES TO PLACE THE SPEECH OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CURRENT SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT OF CRISIS OF THE REASON FUNDAMENTALS, FOUNDATIONAL PARADIGM AND STRUCTURING OF SOCIETY IN NEED OF A CHANGE. IT IS TAKEN AS THEORETICAL THINKING OF AUTHORS LIKE MICHEL VILLEY, DOUZINAS BACK, GILLES LIPOVETSKY, PETER SLOTERDIJK, MAKAU, MUTUA AND BOAVENTURA DE SOUZA SANTOS, AMONG OTHERS. IN THIS DIRECTION, IN FRONT OF THE GOAL SET FORTH HEREIN AND PRESENTED IN THE COURSE OF THE TEXT, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE GUIDELINES DERIVED FROM THE DIALECTICAL METHOD SEEM APPROPRIATE TO THE ORIENTATION OF THE PRESENTED RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT. PRIVILEGING THE DIALECTICAL METHOD IMPLIES RECOGNIZING THAT THE STUDY AIMS TO MAKE A CRITICAL READING OF THE NOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS INTENDED TO POINT OUT EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE HUMAN RIGHTS AS A LEGAL PRODUCTION AND EUROCENTRIC FEATURE POLICY, WITHIN A STRICTLY RATIONALIST BIAS AND OPINIONATED, OWN OF MODERNITY, IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE FRAGILITY OF THE NOTION OF RIGHTS HUMANS AND THEIR INADEQUATE REASONING, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEAKNESS OF ITS NORMATIVE NATURE AND AN EXAGGERATED RATIONALISM THAT, CONTRADICTORILY, THE LEGAL SURPASSES THE HUMAN, ETHICAL AND SOLIDARITY.
81	ACCORDING TO PREVAILING INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WARREN COURT'S DUE PROCESS REVOLUTION, THE SUPREME COURT CONSTITUTIONALIZED CRIMINAL PROCEDURE TO CONSTRAIN THE DISCRETION OF INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS. THESE NARRATIVES, HOWEVER, FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COURT'S DECISIONS DURING THAT REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD THAT ENABLED DISCRETIONARY POLICING. INSTEAD OF BEGINNING WITH THE WARREN COURT, THIS ESSAY LOOKS TO THE LEGAL CULTURE BEFORE THE DUE PROCESS REVOLUTION TO PROVIDE A MORE COHERENT SYNTHESIS OF THE COURT'S CRIMINAL PROCEDURE DECISIONS. IT RECONSTRUCTS THAT CULTURE BY ANALYZING THE PROMINENT CRIMINAL LAW SCHOLAR JEROME HALL'S PUBLIC LECTURES, POLICE AND LAW IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, WHICH HE DELIVERED IN 1952 ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC AND TOTALITARIAN POLICE FORCES. HALL'S DEFINITION OF DEMOCRATIC POLICING APPEALED TO SELF-RULE, THEN TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND FINALLY, TO DUE PROCESS, AS HE STRUGGLED TO ACCOUNT FOR TWENTIETH-CENTURY POLICE FORCES THAT WERE NOT, IN IMPORTANT WAYS, GOVERNED BY THE PEOPLE OR ENTIRELY CONSTRAINED BY LAW. HALL ULTIMATELY SETTLED ON THE IDEA THAT IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY DUE PROCESS MEANT THAT THE POLICE DID NOT DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF A "FAIR TRIAL"-A DEFINITION THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S UNDERSTANDING OF DUE PROCESS, WHICH EMPHASIZES JUDICIAL REVIEW OF POLICE ACTION. THE ESSAY APPLIES THE METHODOLOGY OF CULTURAL HISTORY TO ARGUE THAT DURING THE COLD WAR, HALL ARTICULATED A CONCEPT OF DUE PROCESS THAT WAS NOT JUST A LEGAL NORM BUT ALSO A CULTURAL VALUE THAT RATIONALIZED DISCRETIONARY POLICING AND SERVED TO DISTINGUISH TWO COMPETING SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT THAT BOTH RELIED ON DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY EXPLORING HOW HALL'S EXPLICATION OF DUE PROCESS, WHICH WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF MIDCENTURY VIEWS, MIGHT REVISE STANDARD ACCOUNTS OF THE DUE PROCESS REVOLUTION. UNDERSTANDING THE LEGAL CULTURE THAT CAME BEFORE-AND INFORMED-THE WARREN COURT'S CRIMINAL PROCEDURE DECISIONS SUGGESTS THAT DUE PROCESS FUNCTIONED AS MUCH TO JUSTIFY AS TO RESTRAIN POLICE DISCRETION.
82	THE STUDY OF COLONIALITY AS A "SOCIAL IMAGINARY" (CHARLES TAYLOR) FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DECOLONIALITY INVITES EUROPEAN SCHOLARS, TO "THINK AGAIN", TO INTERROGATE THEIR OWN TRADITIONS, INCLUDING THEIR MODERN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION. IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL DISCUSS A POWERFUL MODERN POLITICAL IMAGINARY, NAMELY THE DEMOCRATIC NARRATIVE OF THE "SOCIAL CONTRACT". SUCH NARRATIVES OR " IMAGINATIONS OF OUR ORIGIN" (URSPRUNGSPHANTASIEN: PHILIP MANOW) GIVE US ANSWERS TO THE ENIGMA OF OUR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL EXISTENCE: WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO LIVE IN THIS POLITICAL COMMUNITY? WHAT DOES IT GIVE US, ASK FROM US? IN THE MODERN NARRATIVE OF THE "SOCIAL CONTRACT", WE ARE TOLD THAT, TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN, WE HAVE/HAD TO LEAVE THE "STATE OF NATURE" (STATUS NATURALIS), A STATE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A STATE OF DISORDER, CONFLICT, AND WAR, AND ACCEPT THE STATUS OF CITIZENSHIP (STATUS CIVILIS) AND A POWERFUL STATE AS GUARANTEE OF PEACE AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I WILL FIRSTLY GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF THE USE OF THIS NARRATIVE IN VERY DIVERSE CONTEXTS: 1) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN RELIGIOUS CIVIL WARS IN THE 16TH AND 17TH CENTURIES (BIRTH OF THE MODERN LIBERAL POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY), 2) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRANSITION OF EUROPEAN NATION-STATES TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER WWII, 3) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRANSITION OF APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA TO A NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY. SECONDLY, I WILL CONCENTRATE ON ONE OF THE FIRST PHILOSOPHERS WHO INTRODUCED THE STATE OF NATURE/CIVIL STATE NARRATIVE, THOMAS HOBBES (1588-1679), TO DISCOVER THAT HIS POLITICAL IMAGINATION IS DEEPLY INFLUENCED BY THE COLONIAL EXPERIENCE IN THE " NEW WORLD", ESPECIALLY THE MEETING WITH THE INDIGENOUS INDIANS IN AMERICA. IN SEVERAL ASPECTS, THEY ARE IN HOBBES' IMAGINATION THE INCARNATION OF THE LIFE IN THE "STATE OF NATURE". THIS RAISES THE QUESTION, HOW THE IDEA OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL CONTRACT CAN BE REFORMULATED, WITHOUT EUROCENTRIC AND RACIST PREMISES, AND WITHOUT SIMPLY REVERSING THE HOBBESIAN NARRATIVE: SINCE THE "COLONIZER" IS THE ROOT OF OUR CONFLICT AND CONTROVERSIES, TO EXPEL HIM WILL RESTORE A DURABLE PEACE.
83	IN THIS PAPER, A NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC MATRIX APPROACH IS USED TO CONDUCT AN IN-DEPTH STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF MODERN URBAN GOVERNANCE, AND AN URBAN INFORMATION MODEL IS DESIGNED FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION BASED ON IT. RANDOM MATRIX THEORY CAN CALCULATE AND GIVE THE AVERAGE RESULT OF ALL INTERACTIONS CONTAINED IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM. BY COMPARING THE DI.ERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF REAL SYSTEMS AND RANDOM MATRICES, THE SPECIAL NONRANDOM PROPERTIES OF REAL SYSTEMS ARE DEDUCED. THE DISSIPATIVE STRUCTURE THEORY OF OPEN COMPLEX SYSTEMS, THE EVOLUTION OF NETWORK ENTROPY DESCRIBING THE ROBUSTNESS OF COMPLEX NETWORKS, CAN EXPLAIN THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF RANDOM MATRIX THEORY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SYSTEM EVOLUTION; THROUGH THE OPEN DEVELOPMENT OF FAIR DATA AND PREVENTION TOOLS TO ACHIEVE ALGORITHM CORRECTION, PROMOTE THE DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF INTELLIGENT MODELS, INTELLIGENT PLATFORMS, AND INTELLIGENT PROGRAMS; AND COMMIT TO THE BENIGN DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL, IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE SMART CITY CONSTRUCTION SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION, WITH A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH OF POLICY INCENTIVES AND LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, IN ADDITION TO THE OVERALL PROMOTION OF GOVERNMENT TRANSFORMATION AND PLURALISTIC GOVERNANCE PATTERNS. IT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING CAPACITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND INSTITUTIONS. IN FACT, THE PRODUCTIVE FORCES WITH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS THE CORE ARE THE MOST ACTIVE FORCES IN SOCIAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT. THE URBAN INFORMATION MODEL IS A TECHNICAL AND CONCEPTUAL CHANGE TRIGGERED BY THE WAVE OF INFORMATION IN THE FIELD OF URBAN PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION AND URBAN MANAGEMENT, WHICH TAKES THE 3D MODEL AS A CARRIER TO REALIZE DIGITAL INFORMATION APPLICATION AND UNIFICATION IN THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE OF TERRITORIAL SPATIAL PLANNING, URBAN DESIGN, AND ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THROUGH THE SIMULATION OF SPATIAL PLANNING AND URBAN DESIGN SPATIAL ELEMENTS AS WELL AS THE ENTRY, MANAGEMENT, AND APPLICATION OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECT INFORMATION.

84	DISGORGEMENT OF ILL-GOTTEN GAIN, SIMILAR TO AN UNJUST ENRICHMENT CLAIM, IS A COMMON REMEDY IN UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ENFORCEMENT. IN JUNE 2017, THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN KOKESH V. SEC THAT DISGORGEMENT IS A PENALTY. AS SUCH, THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN SECTION 28 U.S.C. 2462 FOR ANY "FINE, PENALTY, OR FORFEITURE" BARS THE SEC FROM SEEKING DISGORGEMENT FOR ANY VIOLATION COMMITTED MORE THAN FIVE YEARS BEFORE SUIT. THE KOKESH DECISION HAS REVERBERATED THROUGH FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT. MOST DIRECTLY, IT BARS SEC DISGORGEMENT CLAIMS FOR LONG-RUNNING FRAUDS, COSTING THE AGENCY $1.1 BILLION TO DATE. AS IS TYPICAL FOR SUPREME COURT DECISIONS, KOKESH ALSO RAISED MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERED. IF DISGORGEMENT IS A PENALTY, THEN MOST OTHER ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES ARE ALSO PENALTIES AND ARE THUS TIME LIMITED TO FIVE YEARS. MOREOVER, DISGORGEMENT IN SEC CIVIL ACTIONS IS NOT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN ANY STATUTE. IF DISGORGEMENT IS A PENALTY, THEN THE SEC CANNOT SEEK DISGORGEMENT IN COURT ACTIONS AT ALL. MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE KOKESH DECISION, ITS IMPACT REMAINS UNCERTAIN. USING A UNIQUE DATASET OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS FILED BETWEEN 2010 AND 2018, THIS ARTICLE UNRAVELS THE IMPACTS OF KOKESH. DEPENDING ON HOW BROADLY LOWER COURTS INTERPRET KOKESH, ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF SEC DISGORGEMENT IS AT RISK. AT THE SAME TIME, AND CONTRARY TO CLAIMS ADVANCED BY SEC LEADERSHIP, KOKESH DOES NOT SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINE THE AGENCY'S ABILITIES TO COMPENSATE INVESTORS OR TO DETER MISCONDUCT, BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY CHANGE THE INCENTIVES AT WORK DURING SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS. HOWEVER KOKESH IS INTERPRETED, ONE GROUP OF DEFENDANTS-INDIVIDUALS RUNNING LONG-STANDING FRAUDS TARGETING SMALL-SCALE INVESTORS-CLEARLY BENEFITS. MANY OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO FLEECE ORDINARY PEOPLE OF THEIR NEST EGGS AND THEN KEEP THE MONEY THEY STOLE. EVEN IF SUCH DEFENDANTS CANNOT BE DETERRED, THE RESULT IS CORROSIVE BECAUSE IT OFFENDS BASIC NOTIONS OF FAIRNESS AND THUS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW.
85	THE PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN LIFE HAS BECOME AN IMPERATIVE SOCIAL PROBLEM IN ROMANIA, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FACT THAT 1 IN 4 CITIZENS, OR, MORE PRECISELY, 23.40% OF OUR COUNTRY'S POPULATION, SUFFERS FROM A CHRONIC DISEASE OR A LONG TIME DEFICIENCY IN THEIR HEALTH CONDITION. THUS, WE HAVE CONSIDERED THAT THE ISSUE CAN BE REGARDED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE MORAL VALUES AND THE PRINCIPLES OF BIOETHICS, FROM THAT OF THE LEGAL NORMS AND THE RESULTS OF A FIELD SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. THERE ARE EVIDENCED NORMATIVE DOCUMENTS THAT PROVIDE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN GENERAL, AT THE EUROPEAN AND NATIONAL LEVEL, AND WE EXPLAINED THE GAP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRESENT STATE OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN ROMANIA. WE HAVE USED THE RESULTS OF A FIELD RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON A SAMPLE OF 1,000 PEOPLE IN CRAIOVA AND DROBETA TURNU-SEVERIN, STATING THAT OVER 20% OF THE POPULATION OF THESE CITIES SUFFERS FROM CERTAIN DISEASES. THERE WERE RENDERED VALUABLE THE RESULTS OF A FIELD RESEARCH, MADE ON A SAMPLE OF 1,000 PEOPLE, FROM THE CITIES OF CRAIOVA AND DR. TURNU-SEVERIN, WHICH ATTEST THAT OVER 22% OF THE POPULATION FROM CRAIOVA, AND OVER 30% OF THE POPULATION FROM DR. TURNU-SEVERIN SUFFERS FROM SPECIFIC DISEASES, INCLUDING SOME SERIOUS ONES (ALMOST 3%). SYSTEMATICALLY, WE ANALYZED THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE ROMANIAN HEALTH SYSTEM. DUE TO THIS FACT, OVER 120 SERIOUSLY ILL PATIENTS SUED THE ROMANIAN STATE BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE RIGHT TO TREATMENT, DIMINISHING THEIR CHANCES OF SAVING THEIR LIVES. IN THE FINAL PART OF THE ARTICLE WE SHOWED, SYNTHETICALLY, A NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS AND PROPOSALS FOR MAKING UP A NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM, EFFECTIVE IN ROMANIA, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF PATIENTS AND THE ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THEM. SIMULTANEOUSLY, WE STRESSED THE NEED FOR THE EDUCATION OF CITIZENS IN MATTERS OF LAW, ENJOYING THE RIGHTS TO HEALTH PROTECTION IN THE AREA OF EU COUNTRIES, LAWS, WHICH THEY DO NOT KNOW.
86	AUTHORITARIANISM HAS BEEN UNDERGOING A METAMORPHOSIS. HISTORICALLY, AUTHORITARIANS OPENLY REPRESSED OPPONENTS BY VIOLENCE AND HARASSMENT AND SUBVERTED THE RULE OF LAW TO PERPETUATE THEIR RULE. THE POST-COLD WAR CRACKDOWN ON THESE TRANSPARENTLY AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVES TO AVOID THEM. INSTEAD, THE NEW GENERATION OF AUTHORITARIANS LEARNED TO PERPETUATE THEIR POWER THROUGH THE SAME LEGAL MECHANISMS THAT EXIST IN DEMOCRATIC REGIMES. IN SO DOING, THEY CLOAK REPRESSIVE PRACTICES UNDER THE MASK OF LAW, IMBUE THEM WITH THE VENEER OF LEGITIMACY, AND RENDER ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND ELIMINATE. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE CROSS-REGIONAL ACCOUNT OF THAT PHENOMENON, WHICH I TERM "STEALTH AUTHORITARIANISM." DRAWING ON RATIONAL-CHOICE THEORY, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE EXPANSION OF STEALTH AUTHORITARIANISM ACROSS DIFFERENT CASE STUDIES. THE ARTICLE FILLS A VOID IN THE LITERATURE, WHICH HAS LEFT UNDERTHEORIZED THE AUTHORITARIAN LEARNING THAT OCCURRED AFTER THE COLD WAR AND THE EMERGING RELIANCE ON LEGAL, PARTICULARLY SUB-CONSTITUTIONAL, MECHANISMS TO PERPETUATE POLITICAL POWER. ALTHOUGH STEALTH AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES ARE MORE PREVALENT IN NONDEMOCRACIES, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES THAT THEY CAN ALSO SURFACE IN REGIMES WITH FAVORABLE DEMOCRATIC CREDENTIALS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN SO DOING, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ORIENT THE SCHOLARLY DEBATE TOWARDS REGIME PRACTICES, RATHER THAN REGIME TYPES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY DISCUSSING THE IMPLICATIONS OF STEALTH AUTHORITARIANISM FOR SCHOLARS AND POLICYMAKERS. THE EXISTING DEMOCRACY-PROMOTION MECHANISMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE ARE OF LIMITED USE IN DETECTING STEALTH AUTHORITARIAN TACTICS. PARADOXICALLY, THESE MECHANISMS, WHICH HAVE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING TRANSPARENT DEMOCRATIC DEFICIENCIES, HAVE PROVIDED LEGAL AND POLITICAL COVER TO STEALTH AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES AND CREATED THE VERY CONDITIONS IN WHICH THESE PRACTICES THRIVE. IN ADDITION, STEALTH AUTHORITARIANISM CAN ULTIMATELY MAKE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE MORE DURABLE BY CONCEALING ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES UNDER THE MASK OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, STEALTH AUTHORITARIANISM IS LESS INSIDIOUS THAN ITS TRADITIONAL, MORE REPRESSIVE ALTERNATIVE AND CAN, UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, PRODUCE THE CONDITIONS BY WHICH DEMOCRACY CAN EXPAND AND MATURE, IN A TWO-STEPS-FORWARD-ONE-STEP-BACKWARD DYNAMIC.
87	THE FUTURE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS UNCERTAIN. THE LONG-HOPED-FOR REVITALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ITS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES FOLLOWING THE END OF THE COLD WAR NOW SEEMS AT RISK FROM AN INCREASING DEFORMALIZATION OF, AND NEO-LIBERAL DISREGARD FOR, INTERNATIONAL LAW. MEANWHILE EUROPEAN INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS ARE RESPONDING BY REASSERTING A KANTIAN PROJECT FOR A GLOBAL CONSTITUTION UNDER AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE I ATTEMPT TO POSITION THESE RECENT CLAIMS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IS UNDERGOING A PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF A LONG-STANDING CONNECTION, SINCE AT LEAST THE POST-REVOLUTIONARY NINETEENTH CENTURY, BETWEEN THE IDEA OF A POSITIVE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE EMERGING STRUCTURES OF THE EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL NATION-STATE. IF ONE CAN TRACE A COSMOPOLITAN OR CONSTITUTIONAL PROJECT TO THE INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC PUBLIC LAW FROM THIS TIME, ONE CAN ALSO TRACE THE INHERENT TENSION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL LAW'S PROMISE OF A SUBSTANTIVE 'GOOD LIFE', OR SENSE OF JUSTICE, AND ITS PURPORTED LEGITIMACY IN A COMMITMENT TO A VOLUNTARIST, OR CONTRACTARIAN, FORM OF OBLIGATION. THESE SIMULTANEOUS COMMITMENTS SEEM INCOMPATIBLE, BUT ARE INSEPARABLE FROM INTERNATIONAL LAW'S EMBEDDED LIBERALISM, WHICH REQUIRES INTERPLAY BETWEEN THEM TO MAKE SENSE OF PROGRESS IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY EXPLICIT UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY. IN TRACING SIMILARITIES IN CONCERNS FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO THE TWENTY-FIRST, AS WELL AS REPETITIONS IN LEGAL ARGUMENTS, I SUGGEST THAT THE ALTERNATIVES OF AMERICAN EMPIRE AND A (EUROPEAN) VISION OF GLOBAL CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE MERELY NECESSARY OPPOSITIONS, REFLECTING THIS BROADER TENSION UNDERLYING THE DISCIPLINE. BECAUSE LAWYERS AVOID CLARITY ON WHAT IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN A LEAP FROM (SELECTIVE) EMPIRICAL REALISM TOWARDS ASSERTIVE NORMATIVE AMBITION, I ARGUE THAT IT IS A MAINSTREAM, LIBERAL-JURIDICAL CONSCIOUSNESS - RATHER THAN ANY EXPLICIT LEGAL THEORY - WHICH CONTINUES TO SUSTAIN SHARED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL LAW'S PAST, AS WELL AS A PROMISE OF A FUTURE LIBERAL WORLD ORDER. THE APPARENTLY OPPOSING VISIONS OF FUTURE WORLD ORDER ARE MERELY DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE SAME COIN: EACH REFLECTING BACK, BUT EACH ULTIMATELY SUSTAINED BY THE OTHER.
88	THE CASE OF MUHAMMAD SALAH, A PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN GROCER AND CHICAGO RESIDENT, IS THE LONGEST-RUNNING TERRORISM CASE IN THE UNITED STATES. HE WAS BROUGHT TO TRIAL ON TERRORISM-FUNDING CHARGES IN OCTOBER 2006 AFTER A THIRTEEN-YEAR SAGA THAT BEGAN WITH HIS JANUARY 1993 ARREST IN ISRAEL AS THE "WORLD COMMANDER OF HAMAS" AND THAT CONTINUED IN THE UNITED STATES FOLLOWING HIS RELEASE FROM ISRAELI PRISON IN LATE 1997. THOUGH ACQUITTED OF ALL TERRORISM-RELATED CHARGES BY A U. S. FEDERAL JURY IN CHICAGO IN FEBRUARY 2007, SALAH WAS CONVICTED ON A SINGLE COUNT OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. IN THIS EXCLUSIVE REPORT FOR JPS, SALAH'S LAWYERS RECOUNT THE UNFOLDING OF THIS LANDMARK AND LABYRINTHINE CASE, ANALYZING ITS LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS AND IMPLICATIONS. HIS PROSECUTION SERVED TO ADVANCE NEW STANDARDS GOVERNING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF COERCED CONFESSIONS AT TRIAL AND THE USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ESTABLISHING NEW PROCEDURES FOR PREVENTING THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF KEY WITNESSES AND CLOSING THE COURTROOM TO THE PRESS AND PUBLIC DURING CRUCIAL TESTIMONY. EVEN BEFORE HIS U. S. TRIAL, HIS TAPED CONFESSION EXTRACTED UNDER SHIN BET TORTURE SERVED AS THE LINCHPIN OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT'S INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF PERSONS IT SUSPECTED OF PROVIDING MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE TO ISRAELI OCCUPATION. MORE BROADLY, THE YEARS COVERED BY THE CASE SHOW THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS THE MELDING OF THE DISCOURSES, STRATEGIES, TACTICS, AND AIMS OF U. S. AND ISRAELI LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE BODIES LONG BEFORE THE POST-9/11 LAUNCH OF THE "GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR." PART I OF THIS TWO-PART ACCOUNT LAYS THE GROUND FOR THE 2006-7 CHICAGO TRIAL, COVERING THE PERIOD OF SALAH'S ARREST, INTERROGATION, AND IMPRISONMENT IN ISRAEL AND THE INVESTIGATIONS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM UPON HIS RETURN. PART II WILL FOCUS ON THE CRAFTING OF THE CASE BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDER PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH AND THE TRIAL ITSELF.
89	IGNORANTIA LEGIS NON EXCUSAT-IGNORANCE OF THE LAW DOES NOT EXCUSE-IS A CENTURIES-OLD CRIMINAL LAW MAXIM FAMILIAR TO LAWYER AND LAYPERSON ALIKE. UNDER THE DOCTRINE, AN ACCUSED FINDS LITTLE PROTECTION IN THE CLAIM "BUT, I DID NOT KNOW THE LAW," FOR ALL ARE PRESUMED EITHER TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE LAW'S COMMANDS OR TO PROCEED IN IGNORANCE AT THEIR OWN PERIL. THE IGNORANT MUST BE PUNISHED ALONG WITH THE KNOWING, THE MAXIM TEACHES, TO ACHIEVE A BETTER EDUCATED AND MOVE LAW-ABIDING POPULACE AND TO AVOID THE EASY-TO-ASSERT AND DIFFICULT-TO-DISPUTE CLAIM OF IGNORANCE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW FROM THE LIPS OF ANY PERSON FACING CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT. DESPITE THIS COUNTRY'S LONG-STANDING ALLEGIANCE TO THE HOARY MAXIM, OVER THE LAST CENTURY, AND IN PARTICULAR OVER THE LAST DECADE, THE COURTS HAVE SERIOUSLY ERODED THE IGNORANTIA LEGIS PRINCIPLE BY FREQUENTLY CONSTRUING THE MENS REA TERM "WILLFULLY" TO REQUIRE PROOF OF AN ACCUSED'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW. THE EROSIVE EFFECT THAT THESE CONSTRUCTIONS HAVE HAD ON THE IGNORANTIA LEGIS MAXIM IS REFERRED TO IN THIS ARTICLE AS THE "JURISPRUDENCE OF WILLFULNESS." PROFESSOR DAVIES DEMONSTRATES THAT, CONTRARY TO THE MAXIM, THE NUMBER OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL STATUTES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUED TO IMPOSE SUCH A HEIGHTENED MENS REA REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY QUIRE LARGE. THE ARTICLE REVEALS THAT, IF THE COURTS CONTINUE TO EMPLOY THEIR CURRENT INTERPRETIVE APPROACH TO THE TERM "WILLFULLY," AT LEAST 160 ADDITIONAL FEDERAL STATUTES CONTAINING THE TERM ARE AT RISK OF SIMILAR TREATMENT. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT CONTEMPORARY CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE TROUBLESOME SCIENTER TERM TO IMPOSE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW ELEMENT HAVE BEEN GROUNDED ON DOUBTFUL, UNCHALLENGED LOGIC AND HAVE BEQUEATHED A LEGACY OF GRAVE INTERPRETIVE CONFUSION. PROFESSOR DAVIES MAINTAINS THAT MUCH OF THE "JURISPRUDENCE OF WILLFULNESS" IS INIMICAL TO CONGRESSIONAL JUDGMENTS AND THEREFORE, VIOLATIVE OF RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLES. THE ARTICLE URGES A RETURN TO THE IGNORANTIA LEGIS PRINCIPLE IN ALL CASES IN WHICH A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO ABANDON THE MAXIM WHEN EMPLOYING THE TERM "WILLFULLY" IS MISSING.
90	ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION OFTEN INVOLVES INTERAGENCY COORDINATION. THIS ARTICLE ESTABLISHES THAT THIS PHENOMENON, WHICH IT TERMS "COORDINATED INTERAGENCY ADJUDICATION," EXISTS IN MANY AREAS OF PUBLIC LAW WITH LARGE ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION CASELOADS. THESE AREAS INCLUDE IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS, GENERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION, DOMESTIC SECURITY, AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. INTERAGENCY ADJUDICATION REQUIRES SPECIAL ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE RULE-OF-LAW AND JURISDICTIONAL MATTERS IMPLICATED BY THE EXTENSION AND COORDINATION OF ADJUDICATION ACROSS INSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARIES. THE AIM OF COORDINATED INTERAGENCY ADJUDICATION IS TO EMPLOY THE RESOURCES OF MULTIPLE AGENCIES TO IMPROVE DETERMINATIONS OF STATUTORY VIOLATIONS OR OF ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS. HOWEVER, COORDINATED ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION ACROSS AGENCIES MAY HAVE PROBLEMATIC CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE AREA OF IMMIGRATION, POORLY ADMINISTERED COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAUSED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF ASYLUM SEEKERS AND MENTALLY INCOMPETENT NONCITIZENS. THESE EVENTS, IN TURN, LED TO TWO RECENT HIGH-PROFILE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, THE PHENOMENON OF COORDINATED INTERAGENCY ADJUDICATION HIGHLIGHTS BROADER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE REACH OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY AND THE BREADTH OF AGENCIES' AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN JURISDICTION. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERAGENCY COORDINATION TO LARGE SWATHS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION AND THE COMPLICATIONS IT HAS CAUSED IN THE IMMIGRATION CONTEXT, SCHOLARS, THE COURTS, AND EVEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ITSELF REMAIN RELATIVELY UNAWARE OF IT. THIS ARTICLE REMEDIES THIS LACK OF AWARENESS. IT BRINGS TO LIGHT COORDINATED INTERAGENCY ADJUDICATION PROCESSES BY PRESENTING INSTANCES OF THIS PHENOMENON IN A COMPREHENSIVE TYPOLOGY INVOLVING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, IT ARGUES THAT, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF ADJUDICATION ACROSS AGENCY BOUNDARIES, THESE PROCESSES ESCAPE THE EVALUATION NECESSARY TO ENSURE THEIR QUALITY. THEREFORE, EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVERSIGHT IS REQUIRED BOTH TO PREVENT COORDINATION FIASCOS SUCH AS THOSE WROUGHT IN THE IMMIGRATION CONTEXT AND TO ENSURE THAT AGENCIES REMAIN WITHIN REASONABLE JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDS. AS SUCH, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CONTEXT-SPECIFIC, NARROWLY FOCUSED, EX ANTE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVERSIGHT OF COORDINATED ADJUDICATION PROCESSES.
91	THE MAIN INCENTIVES FOR RUSSIA'S AND UKRAINE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE FIRST COMMITMENT PERIOD OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL WERE ITS MECHANISMS. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE ANTICIPATED POST-2012 MECHANISMS WILL OFFER RUSSIA AND UKRAINE ARE EXPLORED IN LIGHT OF THE LESSONS FROM JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI) AND THE GREEN INVESTMENT SCHEME (GIS) DURING THIS FIRST PERIOD. FOUR KEY FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THE SUCCESS OF THESE MECHANISMS ARE IDENTIFIED: THE DESIGN OF THE MECHANISMS, THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, THE COORDINATION REQUIRED, AND THE POLITICAL WILL GAINED. EVEN THOUGH A WEAK RULE OF LAW, PROBLEMS WITH POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, AND THE AMBIGUOUS ROLE OF PRIVATE-SECTOR ACTORS ARE NOT MAKE OR BREAK' ISSUES, THEY ARE LIKELY TO DEFER FUTURE MECHANISMS. SUCCESS AND FAILURE WILL, RATHER, HINGE ON THE PRIORITY THESE FACTORS ARE ACCORDED BY THE TOP LEADERSHIP. IT IS LIKELY THAT SIMPLE MECHANISMS THAT ONLY INVOLVE A FEW ACTORS WILL BE LESS COMPLICATED TO SET UP AND RUN THAN, FOR INSTANCE, EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEMES (WHICH REQUIRE DOMESTIC BURDEN SHARING). PROJECT-BASED OPTIONS IN WHICH DOMESTIC ACTORS HAVE GAINED EXPERIENCE MAY BE BETTER SUITED. HOWEVER, ANY LESSONS PRIOR TO THE NEW MECHANISMS TAKING A CLEARER SHAPE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS PRELIMINARY.POLICY RELEVANCETHE KYOTO PROTOCOL MECHANISMS, DESPITE THEIR PROBLEMS, PROVIDED RUSSIA AND UKRAINE WITH THEIR MAIN INCENTIVES FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROTOCOL'S FIRST COMMITMENT PERIOD. AS THE CHANCES THAT THESE COUNTRIES WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE SECOND COMMITMENT PERIOD SEEM SLIM, THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE ANTICIPATED POST-2012 MECHANISMS WILL OFFER RUSSIA AND UKRAINE ARE EXPLORED IN LIGHT OF THE LESSONS FROM JI AND GIS. THE KEY FACTORS THAT HAVE DETERMINED THE SUCCESS AND FAILURE OF THESE MECHANISMS ARE LIKELY TO BE OF RELEVANCE TO FUTURE MECHANISMS. IT IS ARGUED THAT - OF THE POST-2012 OPTIONS AVAILABLE - SIMPLE MECHANISMS WITH FEW ACTORS INVOLVED SHOULD BE CHOSEN. PROJECT-BASED OPTIONS RATHER THAN EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEMES MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED DUE TO EXPERIENCE GAINED BY DOMESTIC ACTORS.
92	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE OF MERCHANTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE EDUCATION IN THE RUSSIAN PROVINCE DURING THE SECOND THIRD OF THE 19TH CENTURY (BASED ON THE MATERIALS OF VOLOGDA PROVINCE). WOMEN'S EDUCATION STARTED BEING DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM IN 1800-1820. IT BECAME POSSIBLE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SUCH EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTS AS "STATUTE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SUBORDINATED TO UNIVERSITIES" AND "STATUTE OF GYMNASIUMS AND SCHOOLS OF DISTRICT AND PARISH" THAT WERE RELEASED IN 1804 AND 1828 RESPECTIVELY. IN 1830-1850 WOMEN'S PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS STARTED APPEARING IN VOLOGDA PROVINCE THANKS TO THE BIG SUPPORT OF LOCAL MERCHANTS. THE EXAMPLES OF SUCH SCHOOLS WERE KADNIKOVSKOE (1838), GRYAZOVETSKOE (1840), YARENSKOE (1843), VELIKO-USTYUGSKOE (1844). ANOTHER IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENT DEVOTED TO FEMALE EDUCATION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 1858. IT WAS "REGULATIONS ON WOMEN'S SCHOOLS" THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IN VOLOGDA, TOTMA, UST-SYSOLSK AND YARENSK. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED THANKS TO THE HUGE SUPPORT OF LOCAL MERCHANTS, WHO BECAME THE INITIATORS OF THE OPENING OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IN TOTMA AND UST-SYSOLSK. AT THE SAME TIME THE MERCHANTS' WIVES BECAME THE TRUSTEES OF SUCH SCHOOLS (HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE IN UST-SYSOLSK WHERE THE MERCHANT OF THE 1ST GUILD LATKIN V.N. GOT TO BE THE TRUSTEE ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR RULE OF LAW). AMONG THE SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS SUPPORT WERE MEANS OF LOCAL MERCHANTS WHO BOUGHT A LOT OF BOOKS, SCHOOLS SUPPLIES AND FURNITURE. BESIDES, THEY WERE REALLY INVOLVED INTO THE CHARITY AND DONATED MONEY DURING SUCH HOLIDAYS AS EASTER AND CHRISTMAS. THE BUILDINGS - WHERE THE WOMEN'S SCHOOLS WERE SITUATED - ALSO WERE TAKEN CARE OF BY MERCHANTS. FOR INSTANCE, IN 1858-1859 IN UST-SYSOLSK THE MERCHANT ZABOEV I.N. BUILT A WOODEN BUILDING FOR THE WOMEN'S SCHOOL USING HIS OWN MONEY. THUS, THE LOCAL MERCHANTS GAVE WIDE AND COMPLEX SUPPORT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE EDUCATION IN VOLOGDA PROVINCE.
93	PURPOSE THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE 2019 SOCIAL MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG AND THOSE OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW (NSL) FOR HONG KONG FOR ONE COUNTRY TWO SYSTEMS (OCTS). IT FURTHER EXPLORES HOW THESE FACTORS POTENTIALLY PROMOTE OR THREATEN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF OCTS A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE FACTORS UNDERPINNING THE RATIONALE OF OCTS AS A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS AND WHETHER THIS CONSENSUS IS INVIOLABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS ARTICLE USES THE CONCEPT OF SELECTIVE ADAPTATION, ESPECIALLY THE ELEMENT OF COMPLEMENTARITY TO EXPLAINTHE LEGAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE PEOPLE & APOS;S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) IN RELATION TO HONG KONG AND TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE 2019 SOCIAL MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG AND THOSE OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE NSL FOR HONG KONG FOR OCTS. IT FURTHER EXPLORES HOW THESE FACTORS POTENTIALLY PROMOTE OR THREATEN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF OCTS A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS. IT ALSO DISCUSSES THE FACTORS UNDERPINNING THE RATIONALE OF OCTS AS A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS AND WHETHER THIS CONSENSUS IS INVIOLABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. FINDINGS IT IS STILL POSSIBLE AND FEASIBLE FOR CHINA AND THE WEST TO WORK OUT A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS TO SUSTAIN AND/OR RESTORE THE CORE VALUES OF HONG KONG - THE RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION - WHILE ACCOMMODATING THE PRC'S POLITICAL CONCERNS ABOUT NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY. THIS INTRINSIC VALUE OF OCTS IN TERMS OF SEEKING COMPLEMENTARITY AND COEXISTENCE BETWEEN THE WESTERN LIBERAL NORMS OF GOVERNANCE AND CHINESE SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY, SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND THAT THE OCTS POLICY SHOULD REMAIN IN FULL FORCE TO SERVE AS A NORMATIVE CONSENSUS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WEST, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROPOSED NORMATIVE CONSENSUS RESTS ON THE PRC'S SELF-INTEREST. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW ORIGINAL RESEARCH THAT APPLIES THE PARADIGM OF SELECTIVE ADAPTATION TO EXPLAIN AND UNDERSTAND THE LEGAL BEHAVIOUR AND PHENOMENON IN RELATION TO PRC'S POLICY TOWARDS HONG KONG.
94	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A NOVEL THEORY OF THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE BY LOCATING ITS FOUNDATIONS IN A CONUNDRUM ABOUT ULTRA VIRES ACTION, EXEMPLIFIED BY THE ANCIENT QUESTION: WHO WILL GUARD THE GUARDIANS? THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE MARKS SOME QUESTIONS AS ULTRA VIRES THE JUDICIAL POWER, OR BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS TO RESOLVE. CORRESPONDINGLY, DESIGNATION OF A QUESTION AS POLITICAL TYPICALLY IDENTIFIES IT AS LYING WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF A NONJUDICIAL INSTITUTION TO SETTLE. EVEN AFTER DENOMINATING A QUESTION AS POLITICAL, HOWEVER, COURTS RETAIN A RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK ACTIONS BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT OVERREACH THOSE INSTITUTIONS' AUTHORITY AND THUS ARE THEMSELVES ULTRA VIRES. THE NEED FOR THE JUDICIARY TO PRESS TO THE OUTER LIMITS OF ITS JURISDICTION TO REIN IN ULTRA VIRES ACTION BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS RENDERS POLITICAL QUESTION RULINGS LESS CATEGORICAL, AND ALSO LESS DISTINCT FROM MERITS DECISIONS, THAN BOTH JUDGES AND COMMENTATORS HAVE OFTEN IMAGINED. THE INESCAPABLE ROLE OF THE COURTS IN IDENTIFYING ULTRA VIRES ACTION BY OTHER BRANCHES ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE POSSIBILITY OF ULTRA VIRES ACTION BY THE COURTS THEMSELVES. THE PAIRED RISKS OF ULTRA VIRES ACTION BY THE COURTS AND ULTRA VIRES ACTION BY OTHER BRANCHES IF THE COURTS COULD NOT ASSERT JURISDICTION TO RESTRAIN THEM-BOTH MADE VIVID BY THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE-DEFINE WHAT THIS ARTICLE CALLS THE ULTRA VIRES CONUNDRUM. THE ULTRA VIRES CONUNDRUM, IN TURN, GIVES RISE TO WHAT WE MIGHT THINK OF AS ULTIMATE POLITICAL QUESTIONS: WHAT HAPPENS IF COURTS ERR IN THEIR DETERMINATION OF THE OUTER BOUNDS OF THEIR OWN POWER? IF THE COURTS ACT ULTRA VIRES, DO THEIR DECISIONS BIND CONSCIENTIOUS OFFICIALS OF OTHER BRANCHES? AND IF NOT, WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHEN JUDICIAL ACTION IS ULTRA VIRES? BESIDES FORMULATING THE ULTRA VIRES CONUNDRUM AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT DEFINE ITS CORE, THIS ARTICLE SOLVES A NUMBER OF MORE TRADITIONAL, INTERRELATED PUZZLES ABOUT THE POLITICAL QUESTION DOCTRINE THAT APPEAR IN A NEW LIGHT ONCE THE ULTRA VIRES CONUNDRUM LIES EXPOSED. IT ALSO TRACES PREVIOUSLY UNEXPLORED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW.
95	THE PROVIDERS OF NETWORK SERVICES (AND THE MAKERS OF NETWORK DEVICES) KNOW AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT ABOUT OUR LIVES. BECAUSE THEY DO, THESE NETWORK INTERMEDIARIES ARE BEING ASKED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT IN SOLVING CRIMES OR GATHERING INTELLIGENCE. GIVEN HOW MUCH THEY KNOW ABOUT US, IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN SECURE THE ASSISTANCE OF THESE INTERMEDIARIES, IT WILL ENJOY A HUGE INCREASE IN ITS THEORETICAL CAPACITY FOR SURVEILLANCE THE ABILITY TO LEARN ALMOST ANYTHING ABOUT ANYONE. THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE SERIOUS SOCIAL HARM, EVEN ASSUMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO ADHERE TO ORDINARY DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND THE RULE OF LAW. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS FOR NETWORK INTERMEDIARIES TO REFUSE GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR AID AND ATTEMPT TO SUSTAIN THOSE REFUSALS IN COURT. ALTHOUGH THIS PROPOSAL HAS RECEIVED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ATTENTION, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE FOR SKEPTICISM ABOUT HOW WELL IT CAN WORK. CONGRESS HAS GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT WIDE AUTHORITY TO DEMAND INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE THROUGH TOOLS LIKE SUBPOENAS, THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT, AND TITLE III. EVEN WHEN THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, COURTS HAVE INTERPRETED THE ALL WRITS ACT TO AUTHORIZE A GREAT DEAL OF OPEN-ENDED AID, CONSISTENT WITH THE WELL-SETTLED ANGLO-AMERICAN HISTORY OF THIRD-PARTY ASSISTANCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT IS ALSO FAR FROM UNHEARD OF FOR THE EXECUTIVE TO READ RESTRICTIONS ON ITS SURVEILLANCE AUTHORITY NARROWLY, AND ITS OWN INHERENT POWERS BROADLY, TO ENGAGE IN SURVEILLANCE THAT IS QUASI- OR EXTRA-LEGAL. A SUPERIOR (OR AT LEAST COMPLEMENTARY) RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM IS TO RESTRICT NETWORK INTERMEDIARIES THEMSELVES BY LIMITING HOW MUCH THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT US AND HOW LONG THEY CAN RETAIN IT. THIS APPROACH TREATS ENHANCED STATE SURVEILLANCE AS A PROBLEM CREATED BY THE INTERMEDIARIES' STOCKPILING OF DATA, AND PROPOSES TO SOLVE IT AT THE ROOT-WHICH WOULD, AS A USEFUL SIDE EFFECT, SOLVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PROBLEMS CREATED BY THAT STOCKPILING, TOO.
96	PURPOSE - THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, TYPES OF RIGGING (PRE-POLLING-DAY AND POST-), POLITICS AND VOTING BEHAVIOR, VOTE CASTING AND PERCEPTIONS OF RIGGING IN PAKISTAN'S MOST RECENT ELECTIONS, AND ATTITUDES TOWARD ELECTORAL INTEGRITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM STUDENTS AT THREE DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. IN ALL, 748 UNITS OF ANALYSIS (488 MALE AND 260 FEMALE) RECORDED THEIR RESPONSES BY MEANS OF A SELF-STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE. LINEAR REGRESSION WAS APPLIED TO MEASURE THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VARIABLES, AND THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF THE SCALES WERE TESTED. FINDINGS - A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRE-POLL RIGGING, POST-POLL RIGGING, POLITICS AND VOTING BEHAVIOR, SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS (I.E. AGE, EDUCATION, FATHER'S EDUCATION, BACKGROUND OR PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND MONTHLY HOUSEHOLD INCOMES), THE PERCEPTION OF RIGGING IN THE LAST ELECTIONS AND ATTITUDES TOWARD ELECTORAL INTEGRITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - PAKISTAN'S HISTORY HAS BEEN BLEMISHED BY ELECTORAL MALPRACTICES DURING BOTH DE FACTO AND DE JURE REGIMES. ATTENTION HAS FORMERLY BEEN PAID TO EITHER POLLING-DAY OR POST-ELECTION RIGGING. THE RELATIONSHIP OF ELECTORAL INTEGRITY WITH DIFFERENT FACTORS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY HAVE USUALLY BEEN IGNORED OR OVERLOOKED. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY WOULD HELP POLICY-MAKERS, YOUTH EXPERTS AND ACADEMICIANS TO REORIENT THEIR BEHAVIORS TO STRENGTHEN POLITICAL STABILITY, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONTINUATION OF DEMOCRACY VIA THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE SYSTEM. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - TO THE RESEARCHERS' BEST KNOWLEDGE, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE PEER-REVIEWED STUDY OF PAKISTAN WHICH HAS EXPLORED THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE VARIABLES EXAMINED FOR THIS STUDY. THE MAIN ACADEMIC CHALLENGE THE RESEARCHERS FACED WAS TO FIND A STANDARDIZED AND CONTEXTUALIZED SCALE OR TOOL TO EXPLORE HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF VOTE-RIGGING AFFECTED ATTITUDES TOWARD ELECTORAL INTEGRITY. THUS, THE STRUCTURED SCALES FOR TYPES OF RIGGING AND ELECTORAL INTEGRITY DEVELOPED HERE WOULD BE USEFUL FOR FUTURE STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF ELECTORAL INTEGRITY IN DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES.
97	THE AUTHORS ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL IN UKRAINE, IDENTIFIES ITS MAIN PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS AND SUGGESTS WAYS TO SOLVE THEM. THERE IS A DIRECT INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN INCREASING THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION AND WEAKENING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL. FORMS AND TYPES OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL ARE CONSIDERED DEPENDING ON CONTROLLING SUBJECTS. THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY FORMS OF PUBLIC SECTOR AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE ISSAI STANDARDS WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL AUDIT, PERFORMANCE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE AUDIT. THE PAPER TOUCHES UPON THE NECESSITY OF LEGISLATIVE INTRODUCTION OF AUDIT OF CONFORMITY WITH THE CORRESPONDING DEFINITION OF THE PURPOSE, TASKS, SUBJECTS, OBJECTS, METHODS AND PROCEDURES. IT IS PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARD FOR AUDITING THE COMPLIANCE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES, WHICH WILL DEFINE GENERAL PROVISIONS, PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA OF COMPLIANCE AUDIT, AS WELL AS THE PROCEDURE FOR PLANNING, DIRECTIONS, METHODS AND CONTROL POINTS IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION, GENERALIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RESULTS. THE MAIN GENERALIZED INDICATORS OF ACTIVITY OF THE ACCOUNTING CHAMBER IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2009 AND 2019 ARE PRESENTED AND THE BASIC TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL ARE COVERED. IT CHARACTERIZES THE NUMBER OF INSPECTED OBJECTS, PREPARED REPORTS, THE VOLUME OF DETECTED VIOLATIONS, THE NUMBER OF RELEVANT RESPONSE DOCUMENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED FUNDING. THE STRUCTURE OF IDENTIFIED VIOLATIONS IN THE MAIN AREAS INCLUDES VIOLATIONS OF THE BUDGET LEGISLATION, INEFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF FUNDS AND VIOLATIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE REVENUE SIDE OF THE STATE BUDGET. THE BASIC CRITERIA FOR CARRYING OUT PERFORMANCE AUDIT ARE DEFINED AND THEIR ANALYTICAL ASSESSMENT IS PROVIDED. THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF IMPROVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC FINANCIAL CONTROL WITH THE USE OF KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONCEPT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE OFFERED, THE FUNDAMENTALS OF WHICH INCLUDE THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY, INCLUSIVENESS, EFFICIENCY, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO INTRODUCE AND USE A UNIFIED REPORT ON BUDGET OFFENSES, WHICH WILL FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND ALLOW FOR RECEIVING, PROCESSING AND STOREING LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION ON THE RESULTS OF AUDITING.
98	THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO RETRIEVE AND ANALYSE THE PERSONAL RECORD DOCUMENTS OF YEVHEN ZAKHARCHUK, AN ACTOR OF THE KYIV POLISH THEATRE, WHO WAS ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED BY THE USSR PROSECUTION AUTHORITIES, AND TO RECREATE THE FACTS OF HIS BIOGRAPHY THROUGH SYSTEMIC OVERVIEW OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THE METHODS OF SOURCE STUDY SUCH AS HISTORICAL DOCUMENT SEARCH AND ANALYSIS WERE APPLIED. THE USE OF CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORICAL RESEARCH METHOD MADE IT POSSIBLE TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK OF SOVIET REPRESSIVE APPARATUS AND TO SHOW ITS TOTAL DISRESPECT TO THE RULE OF LAW THAT CAN BE ILLUSTRATED BY THE FALSIFIED CRIMINAL CASE OF YEVHEN ZAKHARCHUK. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE STUDY PROVIDES NEW INFORMATION ON THE BIOGRAPHY OF YEVHEN ZAKHARCHUK ON THE BASIS OF RECENTLY RETRIEVED ARCHIVE DATA AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE RESEARCH OF THEATRICAL ARTS HISTORY OF KYIV AND UKRAINE. CONCLUSIONS. THE PAPER INTRODUCES CASE FILES AND DOCUMENTS STORED IN THE BRANCH STATE ARCHIVE OF SECURITY SERVICE OF UKRAINE, THAT CAN RESTORE THE NATIONAL HISTORIC MEMORY OF PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES FOR DECADES WERE STRICKEN FROM THE RECORDS. THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE BLANKS IN STUDIES OF THE PAST, FOR INSTANCE VARIOUS KINDS OF SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THEATRICAL ARTS. THE REASEARCH IS MAINLY FOCUSED ON THE ATTEMPT OF BIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF A PARTICULAR CRIMINAL CASE FILE STORED IN THE BRANCH STATE ARCHIVE OF SECURITY SERVICE OF UKRAINE, FROM THE SOVIET CRIMINAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE; AS THE PROSECUTIONS OF ACTORS RESULTED NOT ONLY IN TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THE PHENOMENON OF ONE OF NATIONAL THEATRES, BUT ALSO IN LIQUIDATION OF UKRAINIAN AVANT-GUARD THEATRE AND A WHOLE COHORT OF ITS OUTSTANDING REPRESENTATIVES. THUS, ON THE BASIS OF ARCHIVE CASE FILE NO 72250 (DATED 1937), THE PAPER RESTORES THE BIOGRAPHY OF YEVHEN ZAKHARCHUK, AND SHOWS HIM NOT ONLY AS A TALENTED ACTOR BUT ALSO AS A PROMINENT ACTIVIST OF UKRAINIAN REVOLUTION OF 1917-1921. DESPITE OF THE FACT THAT THIS FIGURE IS NOT NEW IN THE THEATRE HISTORIOGRAPHY, THE PAPER PROVIDES A SET OF FACTS OF HIS BIOGRAPHY THAT ARE PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME.
99	THE PERCEPTION OF THE UNITED STATES AS A LAGGARD OR MALINGERER ON CLIMATE CHANGE IS WIDESPREAD. THE CURRENT REALITY, HOWEVER, IS LARGELY UNDERAPPRECIATED AND CONSIDERABLY MORE NUANCED, BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF U.S. DOMESTIC ACTION AND ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL PROCESSES. UNUSUAL IF NOT UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNITED STATES' DOMESTIC POLITICAL, LEGAL, AND CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE HAVE COME TOGETHER ON THE CLIMATE ISSUE IN A REVEALING MANNER ONE THAT THRUSTS INTO SHARP RELIEF THE UNITED STATES' DIFFICULTIES IN MANAGING FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHILE MAINTAINING THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW ON HEAVILY REGULATORY ISSUES SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT NEITHER SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT NOR NEW CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION ARE NECESSARILY CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE UNITED STATES BECOMING A PARTY TO AN AGREEMENT CONTAINING BINDING EMISSION-REDUCTION (MITIGATION) COMMITMENTS ADOPTED AT THE 21ST CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE U.N. FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, TO BE HELD IN PARIS IN DECEMBER 2015. DEPENDING ON THE FORM OF SUCH AN AGREEMENT, WHICH IS PRESENTLY UNDER NEGOTIATION, PORTIONS OF THE PRESIDENT'S CLIMATE ACTION PLAN COULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DOMESTIC LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR THE CONCLUSION OF ALL OR PART OF SUCH A BINDING INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENT AS AN EXECUTIVE AGREEMENT, AS WELL AS FOR ITS DOMESTIC IMPLEMENTATION, OVERCOMING THE LEGAL NECESSITY FOR INTERACTION WITH CONGRESS EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER ITS CONCLUSION. IN MAKING THIS ARGUMENT, THE ARTICLE DISAGGREGATES U.S. INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC CLIMATE POLICY AS IT HAS DEVELOPED TO THE PRESENT FROM A STRUCTURAL POINT OF VIEW. AMONG THE SUBJECTS ANALYZED ARE (I) THE EXTENT OF THE EXECUTIVE'S POWERS IN FOREIGN RELATIONS ON CLIMATE AND RELATED ISSUES; (2) THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING FEDERAL LEGISLATION AS DOMESTIC LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT; (3) OPTIONS AVAILABLE UNDER EXISTING LEGISLATION, BOTH THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND THOSE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION; (4) THE EXTENT, IF ANY, OF THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION, AND THE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY; AND (5) THE ROLE OF THE COURTS.
100	THERE HAS BEEN A LONG TRADITION OF DEMONSTRATING FORMAL EDUCATION'S DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH MANY DIMENSIONS OF DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY, HEALTH, REDUCED MORTALITY, POPULATION CONTROL ETC. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A LITERATURE LOOKING PARTICULARLY AT THE DEMOCRATIC DIVIDEND' FROM EDUCATION, BOTH THROUGH THE LENS OF GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP AS WELL AS MORE GENERALLY THROUGH EDUCATION'S INFLUENCE ON POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. THE SUCCESSFUL SECURING OF GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION (GCE) WITHIN THE AMBITIONS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 4.7 IN SEPTEMBER 2015 WAS A FURTHER MILESTONE IN CONNECTING SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WITH DEMOCRACY, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW'. ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE MANY TELLING EXAMPLES OF HOW GCE CAN BE ROLLED OUT IN SCHOOL CURRICULA, THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT SCHOOL SUBJECTS, ACROSS THE WORLD. ARGUABLY, HOWEVER, THE FORMAL SCHOOL SYSTEM IS FAR FROM BEING THE ONLY LOCATION WHERE MESSAGES ABOUT CITIZENSHIP, WHETHER GLOBAL, NATIONAL OR LOCAL, CAN BE FOUND. DURING THE PERIOD, 2016-2019 IN THE USA AND UK, WITH THE HUGE RISE IN SMART-PHONE USAGE WORLD-WIDE, IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THERE CAN BE MASSIVE MICRO-TARGETING, THROUGH GLOBAL PLATFORMS, OF SELECTED POPULATIONS WITH MULTIPLE MESSAGES ABOUT CITIZENSHIP, NATIONAL IDENTITY, JOB SECURITY, MIGRATION THREATS, POTENTIAL TERRORISM AND A GREAT DEAL ELSE. UNLIKE THE CITIZENSHIP CURRICULA AND TEXTBOOKS OF FORMAL SCHOOLS WHICH ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE, A GREAT DEAL OF THIS NEW SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGING IS RELATIVELY INACCESSIBLE, USING PROCEDURES THAT ARE A LONG WAY FROM TRADITIONAL ELECTIONEERING. THEY ARE ALSO MUCH LESS FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT VAST SUMS ARE NOW BEING SPENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING, PRESENTING AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. THE ROLE AND LEVEL OF EDUCATION IN REACTING CRITICALLY TO SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNING WILL NEED TO BE REVISITED IN THIS NEW WORLD OF CAMPAIGNING AROUND GLOBAL AND NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP. IT IS NO LONGER A DISCUSSION ABOUT EDUCATION'S POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH INCREASED POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, BUT WHETHER CURRENT EDUCATION LEVELS ARE ACTUALLY CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THE CURRENT THREATS TO CITIZENSHIP, AT GLOBAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS.
101	IN HIS MAGNUM OPUS ON RUSSIA'S IMPERIAL HISTORY B.N. MIRONOV CHARACTERIZES HIMSELF AS A POSITIVIST THINKER WHO MARSHALS IMPRESSIVE AMOUNTS OF STATISTICS AND OTHER TYPES OF HARD EVIDENCE, AND EMPLOYS ECONOMIC THEORY, SOCIOLOGICAL PARADIGMS TO UNDERSTAND RUSSIAN SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND DEVELOPMENT, POLITICAL ANALYSIS, ANTHROPOLOGY, AND AT TIMES PSYCHOLOGY TO RUSSIA OVER THE LONGUE DUREE. WITH THIS ARSENAL AT HAND, HE ARGUES AGAINST RUSSIAN EXCEPTIONALISM AND IDENTIFIES RUSSIA INSTEAD AS A TYPICAL EUROPEAN STATE. IN SO DOING, HE EMPHASIZES IMPERIAL RUSSIA'S SUCCESSES AS A STATE, THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS OF WHICH, HE ARGUES, DID NOT CAUSE REVOLUTION AND ATTRIBUTES REVOLUTION TO POLITICAL CAUSES. AS HE HAS TRIED TO DO PREVIOUSLY, THE AUTHOR DOES NOT BEGIN WITH THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY AND LARGELY DOES NOT READ HISTORY BACKWARDS, BUT RATHER DELINEATES RUSSIA'S HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN A ROBUST COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN CONTEXT (OCCASIONALLY BROADENING THAT CONTEXT TO INCLUDE THE UNITED STATES). MORE SPECIFICALLY, B.N. MIRONOV CHARTS RUSSIA'S MODERNIZATION THROUGH THE CREATION OF WELL-DEFINED ESTATES IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SUBSEQUENT BREAKDOWN OF THOSE ESTATES IN THE POST-REFORM PERIOD AS A RESULT OF GREATER SOCIAL MOBILITY; GRADUAL URBANIZATION; INDUSTRIALIZATION; THE BEGINNINGS OF A DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSFORMATION; IMPROVEMENTS IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING; AN INCREASE IN LITERACY; THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CIVIL SOCIETY; THE SPREAD OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AMONG ALL SOCIAL GROUPS; THE GROWTH OF INDIVIDUALISM; AND THE EVENTUAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ALL OF WHICH CONSTITUTE THE ATTRIBUTES OF A MODERN EUROPEAN STATE. THE AUTHOR'S LARGELY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE RUSSIAN PEASANTS' MENTALITE, HOWEVER, SIT UNEASILY WITH HIS CLAIMS ABOUT ADVANCEMENTS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE BY THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. EQUATING PEASANTS' COLLECTIVISM WITH AUTHORITARIANISM AND CONFLATING IT WITH THE BOLSHEVIK PROJECT, HE IMPLICITLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PEASANTS' DARKNESS WAS A MAJOR CAUSE OF REVOLUTION IN 1917. IF ONE REMOVES THIS DARK LENS BUT NOT THE GENUINELY NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF PEASANT LIFE, THE MORE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS APPEAR IN A MORE OPTIMISTIC LIGHT.
102	PAKISTAN'S OBSESSION OF SEARCHING FOR A 'STRATEGIC DEPTH' ACROSS THE DURAND LINE IN AFGHANISTAN AND A 'MUSLIM SPACE' IN THE INDIAN STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR HAS PROVED TO BE A DEVASTATING POLICY FOR THE COUNTRY IN PURSUIT OF WHICH ITS MILITARY-INTELLIGENCE ESTABLISHMENT IMPLANTED THE SEEDS OF ISLAMISM, EXTREMISM AND STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM ON BOTH SIDES OF THEIR BORDERS. THIS STRATEGIC OVERSTRETCH, THOUGH DRIVEN BY A STRONG MILITARY SENSE OF GEO-POLITICS AMONG ITS LARGELY MILITARY RULERS, IS EMBEDDED IN THE COUNTRY'S UNREALISTIC YEARNINGS, OUT OF PLACE PERCEPTIONS AND FALSE GRIEVANCES. THE ARMY OUTSOURCED ITS ILL-CONCEIVED STRATEGY TO JIHADI ORGANISATIONS AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND ALLOWED LOCAL MILITIAS, TERRORIST GROUPS, GUERRILLA ARMIES AND OTHER NON-STATE ACTORS TO EMERGE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY WHO AFTERWARDS CLAIM POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY. RAWALPINDI (ARMY HEADQUARTERS) SUPPORTED THESE TERRORISTS AS A CHEAP WAY TO KEEP INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN OFF BALANCE. BUT OVER THE YEARS, THEY HAVE METAMORPHOSED INTO A MENACE AND THE MORE POWERFUL TERRORIST GROUPS-WHICH ARE ALSO THE MORE RADICAL ONES-HAVE OUTGROWN THEIR HANDLERS; FATALLY WEAKENING THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, DECLINING THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND CREATING MONSTERS THAT THREATEN TO DEVOUR PAKISTANI SOCIETY. IN THE PROCESS, THE FAILURE OF THE STATE APPARATUS IS CREATING A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY AND ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY. CLEARLY, ONGOING FRAGILITY APPEARS TO BE A PRELUDE TO A FAILED STATE. THUS, THE EXTREMISTS' GROWTH AND POWER IN PAKISTANI SOCIETY ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF ITS POLICY TOWARDS INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO PROMOTE LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, TO REDUCE THE ROLE OF MILITARY, TO REFORM MADRASSAH, AND TO EMPHASISE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH CROSS-BORDER TRADE WITH INDIA AND AFGHANISTAN. THE PAKISTANI STRATEGIC OBSESSION HAS LARGE-SCALE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS BOTH FOR ITS NEIGHBOURS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AND HENCE, REQUIRES CLOSER SCRUTINY AND ANALYSIS.
103	FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL, THE LINK BETWEEN FISCAL POLICY, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS ATTRACTED SPECIAL ATTENTION IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE. THIS STUDY SCRUTINIZES THE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE-INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INTERACTION ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF 43 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD OF 2012-2022. METHODOLOGY-WISE, THE STUDY EMPLOYED THE SYSTEM GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENT (SGMM) TO ANALYZE THE PANEL DATA GAINED FROM DEPENDABLE DATA SOURCES; THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR AND THE HERITAGE ECONOMIC FREEDOM INDEX. THE NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY EMANATES FROM THE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE DESIGNATED AND THE INTRODUCTION OF REVENUE-INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INTO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL OF SSA. THE RESULT OF THE STUDY REVEALS THAT GOVERNMENT REVENUE ADVERSELY AFFECTS ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY POSITIVELY ENHANCES ECONOMIC GROWTH BEFORE INTERACTING WITH EACH OTHER. HOWEVER, THE INTERACTIVE COEFFICIENT OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE REAL GDP GROWTH RATE OF SSA COUNTRIES OVER THE STUDY PERIODS. PRECISELY, BEFORE INTERACTING WITH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY, A PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT REVENUE, KEEPING ALL OTHER THINGS CONSTANT, LEADS TO A 0.0866 PERCENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE IT MARKS A 0.2329 PERCENT UPSURGE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE PRESENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. THE RESULT OF THE STUDY FURTHER SHOWS THAT GOVERNMENT REVENUE PROMOTES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE REGION WHEN COMBINED WITH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND OPENNESS TO TRADE WERE THE KEY SOURCES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WHEREAS THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE ADVERSELY IMPACTED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SSA COUNTRIES. THE POLICY IMPLICATION OF THE STUDY IS THAT SSA NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN GOVERNMENT REVENUE MANAGEMENT. FURTHER, THE FINDING OF THE STUDY IMPLIES THAT SSA COUNTRIES NEED TO IMPROVE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THROUGH PROMOTING EFFICIENCY OF THE REGULATORY QUALITY AND THE SIZE OF THE SSA GOVERNMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THE FAST REAL GDP GROWTH RATE OF SSA COUNTRIES DEMANDS IMPROVED INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICATORS SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW AND EXTENDED ACCESS TO THE OPEN MARKET.
104	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS THE FIRST EMPIRICAL AND CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CITIZENS' VIEWS ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. WE FIRST IDENTIFY THREE NORMATIVE FUNCTIONS THAT PUBLIC SPHERES ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM IN REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACIES: THEY PROVIDE VOICE TO ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES, THEY EMPOWER CITIZENS TO CRITICISE POLITICAL AUTHORITIES AND THEY DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ON MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. WE THEN ARGUE THAT CITIZENS DEVELOP DIFFERENTIATED VIEWS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE DEMOCRATIC FUNCTIONS, DEPENDING ON (1) THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE POLITICAL DECISIONS THROUGH PUBLIC DEBATE, AND (2) THE EXTENT TO WHICH VOICE, CRITIQUE AND INFORMATION ADDRESS DEMOCRATIC PROBLEMS THEY PARTICULARLY CARE ABOUT. DRAWING ON WAVE 6 OF THE EUROPEAN SOCIAL SURVEY, THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT CITIZENS IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CONSIDER THE PUBLIC SPHERE VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY, ESPECIALLY ITS ROLE AS A SUPPLIER OF RELIABLE INFORMATION. HOWEVER, CERTAIN GROUPS TEND TO CARE MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. MORE EDUCATED CITIZENS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ASSIGN GREATER IMPORTANCE TO ALL THREE FUNCTIONS. MEMBERS OF CULTURAL AND SEXUAL MINORITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF GIVING VOICE TO ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES, WHILE CITIZENS DISSATISFIED WITH THE GOVERNMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRIORITISE PUBLIC CRITICISM AND ACCESS TO RELIABLE INFORMATION. FINALLY, IN COUNTRIES WITH MORE DEMOCRATIC PUBLIC SPHERES, DIFFERENCES BASED ON EDUCATION AND MINORITY STATUS ARE WIDER, WHILE DIFFERENCES BASED ON GOVERNMENT SATISFACTION DISAPPEAR. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT CITIZENS CARE MORE ABOUT THE PUBLIC SPHERE WHEN THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY INFLUENCE POLITICAL DECISION MAKING THROUGH PUBLIC DEBATE OR WHEN THE PUBLIC SPHERE ADDRESSES DEMOCRATIC PROBLEMS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM. MOREOVER, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT CITIZENS SEE SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT PUBLIC SPHERES PERFORM AS CORE ASPECTS OF DEMOCRACY, COMPARABLE IN IMPORTANCE TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE THUS ADVANCES AN EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED DEFENCE OF THE CENTRALITY OF PUBLIC DEBATE FOR DEMOCRACY.
105	BACKGROUND MUCH LAND IS SUBJECT TO DAMAGE BY CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION WITH CONSEQUENT LOSS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION AND SERVICES. HOW MIGHT THE LOSS BE RECOVERED? RESULTS THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL REHABILITATION. KEY ISSUES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. REHABILITATION MEANS RESTORING THE PREVIOUS CONDITION. WHETHER OR NOT TO RESTORE IS NOT A TECHNICAL BUT A VALUE JUDGEMENT. IT IS SUBJECT TO ADOPTING THE SUSTAINABILITY ETHIC. IF THE ETHIC IS FOLLOWED UNDER RULE OF LAW THEN REHABILITATION MUST BE DONE ALWAYS TO 'THE HIGH STANDARD' WHICH MEANS HANDING DOWN UNIMPAIRED ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION AND NO EXTRA LAND MANAGEMENT. THE ELEMENTS OF THE FORMER CONDITION THAT IT IS INTENDED TO RESTORE MUST BE SPECIFIED. RESTORING THESE IN ANY GIVEN CASE IS THE PURPOSE OF THAT REHABILITATION PROJECT. THE SPECIFIED RESTORATION ELEMENTS MUST BE EASILY MEASURABLE WITH A FEW SIMPLE POWERFUL METRICS. SOME LAND DAMAGE IS NOT FIXABLE SO RESTRAINT MUST BE EXERCISED IN WHAT CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION ARE PERMITTED. IF SUSTAINABILITY IS ADOPTED THEN COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS NOT A VALID FORM OF PROJECT APPRAISAL BECAUSE TRADING OFF PRESENT BENEFITS AGAINST FUTURE LOSSES RELIES ON SUBJECTIVELY DECIDED DISCOUNT RATES, AND BECAUSE NATURAL CAPITAL IS HARD TO PRICE, INDISPENSABLE, IRREPLACEABLE AND NON-SUBSTITUTABLE. ELEMENTS OFTEN TO BE RESTORED INCLUDE AGRICULTURAL LAND CAPABILITY, LANDSCAPE FORM AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION. LAND CAPABILITY IS A WIDELY USED CONVENTION AND, WITH LANDSCAPE FORM, ENCAPSULATE MANY KEY LAND FACTORS, AND ARE EASILY MEASURABLE. RESTORING SOIL AND THEREBY ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTION PROVIDES THE NECESSARY BASE FOR AN ECOLOGICAL PYRAMID. CONCLUSIONS THE NEED FOR REHABILITATION IS NOT TO BE JUSTIFIED BY COST-BENEFIT OR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROOF, BUT RESTS ON A VALUE JUDGEMENT TO SUSTAIN NATURAL CAPITAL FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. DECISION ON WHAT ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS TO PERMIT SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT IS PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY FIXABLE ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE. BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT MUST BE PROACTIVE, DEVELOP REHABILITATION STANDARDS, WORK OUT HOW TO MEET THE STANDARDS, DESIGN SIMPLE POWERFUL METRICS TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE STANDARDS, EMBARK ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, AND REPORT.
106	IN 2012, A NEW JURISDICTIONAL BODY - THE COURT OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY - BEGAN TO OPERATE IN POST-SOVIET SPACE. DURING THE ALMOST SEVEN YEARS OF ACTIVITY, FROM SEPTEMBER 2012 TO MAY 2019, THE COURT PRIMARILY DEALT WITH APPEALS OF ECONOMIC ENTITIES WHO CHALLENGED ACTS OF THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMISSION, AS WELL AS REQUESTS FROM MEMBER STATES AND THE COMMISSION FOR INTERPRETATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. ON ONE HAND, THE DECISIONS OF THE COURT MEET BASIC INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND CONTAIN CERTAIN ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED TO THE COURT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY DO NOT DRAW DETAILED ARGUMENTS AND CLEAR CONCLUSIONS AND SOMETIMES REFLECT THE COURT'S PREDISPOSITION TOWARDS THE COMMISSION AND MEMBER STATES. AS A RESULT, THEY SUCCESSFULLY PERFORM THE TASK OF RESOLVING SPECIFIC DISPUTES, BUT DO NOT PERFORM (AT LEAST EFFECTIVELY) THE GENERAL TASK OF STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW OF THE EAEU. THE COURT DID NOT FORMULATE MAJOR CONCEPTS THAT COMPLEMENT AND ENRICH THE LAW OF THE EAEU. THE AUTHOR SUBSTANTIATES THIS CONCLUSION AND ANALYZES THE COURT USE OF SOURCES OF LAW AND EVIDENCE; ITS PARTICIPATION IN JUDICIAL DIALOGUE; ITS TECHNIQUE OF ARGUMENTATION; LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF ITS DECISIONS; PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEMS FACED BY THE COURT, AND OPTIONS FOR THEIR SOLUTION; THE PRACTICE OF PRESENTING SEPARATE OPINIONS; LEGAL CONCEPTS FORMULATED BY THE COURT, AND ITS OVERALL INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF EAEU LAW. THE INEFFECTIVE RESOLUTION OF PROBLEMS FACED BY THE COURT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE REASONS - SHORTCOMINGS OF APPLICABLE ACTS, THE COURT'S ISOLATION FROM RUSSIAN DOCTRINE, THE COURT'S FOCUS ON AN INTERNAL MODEL OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, MISTRUST ON THE PART OF MEMBER STATES, FAILURE OF THE COURT ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO CONFORM TO INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND THE VERTICAL NATURE OF THE EAEU. IF THESE FACTORS ARE NOT OVERCOME, AND THE COURT DOES NOT CHANGE ITS CONDUCT, IT RISKS BECOMING A DECORATIVE BODY ENGAGED IN EXPLAINING PROVISIONS THAT ARE CLEAR (AND WILL REPEAT THE SAD FATE OF THE CIS ECONOMIC COURT). THIS PROSPECT IS DISCOURAGING.
107	THIS ARTICLE SETS FORTH THE THEORY OF AN ENDURING, EVOLVING SEPARATION OF POWERS, ONE THAT CHECKS AND BALANCES STATE POWER IN WHATEVER FORM THAT POWER HAPPENS TO TAKE. IT SHOWS HOW THIS CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT WAS FIRST RENEWED AND REFASHIONED IN THE 1930S AND 1940S, WHEREIN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SECONDARY REGIME OF ADMINISTRATIVE CHECKS AND BALANCES TRIANGULATED REGULATORY POWER AMONG POLITICALLY APPOINTED AGENCY LEADERS, AN INDEPENDENT CIVIL SERVICE, AND A VIBRANT AND PLURALISTIC CIVIL SOCIETY. AND IT SUPPLIES THE LEGAL PRECEDENT, CORRECTIVE BLUEPRINT, AND NORMATIVE IMPERATIVE FOR SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS (INCLUDING OURS) TO REAFFIRM THAT COMMITMENT WHENEVER NEW THREATS TO LIMITED, RIVALROUS GOVERNMENT ARISE. THIS COMMITMENT TO AN ENDURING, EVOLVING SEPARATION OF POWERS HELPS EXPLAIN OUR PAST AND OUR PRESENT-AND IT READIES US FOR THE FUTURE. FIRST, REFRAMING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE THROUGH THE LENS OF AN ENDURING, EVOLVING SEPARATION OF POWERS PROVIDES A MORE SEAMLESS CONNECTION TO THE FOUNDING. THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY SHIFT TO ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE TOPPLED THE FRAMERS' TRIPARTITE CONSTITUTIONAL REGIME. BUT THE SUBSEQUENT CONSTRUCTION OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION OF POWERS REPRESENTED AN ACT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION, ANCHORING THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE FIRMLY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION OF EMPLOYING RIVALROUS, HETEROGENEOUS INSTITUTIONAL COUNTERWEIGHTS TO PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. SECOND, THIS REFRAMING RESOLVES SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE NORMATIVE AND JURISPRUDENTIAL STRUGGLES IN CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, HARMONIZING TODAY'S LEADING (BUT CONFLICTING) THEORIES AND DOCTRINES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. AND, THIRD, THIS REFRAMING PREPARES US FOR LIFE IN THE POST-ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, A REALITY THAT IS ALREADY BECKONING. INCREASINGLY THE FORCES OF PRIVATIZATION ARE CONSOLIDATING STATE AND COMMERCIAL POWER IN WAYS THAT COMPROMISE ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION OF POWERS. UNDERSTANDING PRIVATIZATION NOT AS A SUI GENERIS PHENOMENON BUT INSTEAD SIMPLY AS THE LATEST, PERHAPS GREATEST, THREAT TO AN ENDURING, EVOLVING SEPARATION OF POWERS ENABLES US TO EMPLOY THE GRAMMAR AND DOCTRINAL IMPERATIVES OF CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS TO INSIST THAT PRIVATIZATION'S PROPONENTS TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REESTABLISHING LIMITED AND RIVALROUS GOVERNANCE AMID THE DYNAMIC TURN TO THE MARKET-OR ELSE ABANDON THE ENTERPRISE ALTOGETHER.
108	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGAL NATURE OF THE UNITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE LEGAL REGULATION IN SOCIAL SECURITY LAW. AUTHOR SHARES THE POSITIONS OF SCIENTISTS WHO VIEW THIS CATEGORY AS A METHOD OF SOCIAL SECURITY LAW, AND AS A PRINCIPLE OF THIS BRANCH OF LAW. THIS CONCLUSION IS FORMULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE PROVISIONS OF SCIENCE OF THEORY OF LAW AND LABOR LAW. THE MAIN OBJECT OF ANALYSIS IS GENERAL LEGAL IMPORTANCE OF UNITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF LEGAL REGULATION. TYPICAL PUBLIC RELATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, SO EACH RULE IS CALCULATED ON ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS OF ONE KIND AND ALL OF THE PERSONS INVOLVED. THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE UNITY OF THE REGULATORY IMPACT. DIFFERENTIATION OF THE SAME LEGAL REGULATION IS BASED ON THE DIVERSITY OF HUMAN RELATIONS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBJECTS OF THE DIFFERENT LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION COMMON APPROACHES TO THE CONTENT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE "PRINCIPLE OF LAW" THE DEFINITION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL SECURITY LAW IS PROPOSED IN THE ARTICLE, AND ITS BRANCH PRINCIPLES ARE NAMED. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES CORRELATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND DIFFERENTIATION AND OTHER STATED IN THE SCIENCE OF SOCIAL SECURITY LAW PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF SOCIAL SECURITY; THE PRINCIPLE OF ESTABLISHING THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL SECURITY, GUARANTEED WORTHY LIFE OF HUMAN AND THE PRINCIPLE OF DIVERSITY OF GROUNDS AND TYPES OF SOCIAL SECURITY. IT WAS REVEALED THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN THESE NAMED PRINCIPLES AND THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY OF CITIZENS. THE CONTENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY IMPLIES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF GROUNDS AND CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL SECURITY ALLOWED TO REACH THE FULLEST PROTECTION OF CITIZENS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIO-RISK SITUATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE LEGISLATION SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PECULIARITIES OF SOCIAL RISKS, AS WELL AS THE SPECIFICITIES OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF PERSONS WHO NEED PROTECTION FROM THEM.
109	FOR OVER A GENERATION, CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND ACADEMIC JURISPRUDENCE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE, ON THE ONE HAND, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION'S FUNDAMENTALITY WITH, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FACT THAT LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL RULES FREQUENTLY DO NOT PRODUCE DETERMINATE ANSWERS TO CONCRETE CONTROVERSIES. THE APPROACH OF RADICAL DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD ABANDON JUDICIAL REVIEW IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ALL THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT SOME JUDICIALLY ENFORCEABLE LIMITS ON POLITICS ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT MAJORITARIAN TYRANNY. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, CONSTITUTIONAL THEORIES THAT ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY JUDICIAL REVIEW HAVE LIMITED UTILITY; AT BEST THEY STRIKE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY AND THE COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN DIFFICULTY. ACADEMIC JURISPRUDENCE FACES A PARALLEL DILEMMA. UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY, BOTH POSITIVISM AND ITS PRINCIPAL ALTERNATIVE-DWORKIN'S "LAW AS INTEGRITY"-TURN OUT TO ADOPT THE SAME STRATEGY FOR COPING WITH LEGAL INDETERMINACY: EACH CLAIMS THAT THE LAW'S AREAS OF AMBIGUITY ARE SMALL; YET NEITHER THEORY NOR ANY OF THE LEADING APPROACHES TO CONSTITUTIONALISM PROPOSES CONCRETE MEASURES TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF LEGAL INDETERMINACY. DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM THE LEGAL PROCESS APPROACH OF HART AND SACKS, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT INSTEAD OF DEVISING JUSTIFICATIONS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OR EXPLANATIONS OF THE TASK OF JUDGES, THEORISTS WOULD. DO BETTER TO DESIGN INSTITUTIONS THAT REDUCE THE DOMAIN OF LEGAL INDETERMINACY. WHERE HART AND SACKS PROPOSED DEFERENCE TO POLITICALLY ACCOUNTABLE ACTORS, HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE ADVOCATES DEEP. COLLABORATION WITH THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. DEPARTING FROM THE LEGAL PROCESS ASSUMPTION THAT COURTS MUST DEFER TO ONE OF A FIXED MENU OF INSTITUTIONS, THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A MODEL OF "EXPERIMENTALIST" COURTS AND AGENCIES THAT ARE ALWAYS IN TRANSITION. THIS MODEL IS BASED IN PART ON THE EXPLOSIVE EMERGENCE OF "PROBLEM-SOLVING COURTS," NOMINALLY JUDICIAL BODIES THAT ARE MORE AKIN TO DECENTRALIZED ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES THAN TO CONVENTIONAL ADJUDICATORS. THE MODEL IS ALSO BASED ON SOME HINTS IN SUPREME COURT DOCTRINE THAT SUGGEST A ROLE FOR APPELLATE COURTS IN USING THE OPPORTUNITY OF LEGAL INDETERMINACY TO CREATE THE PRECONDITIONS FOR LOCAL DELIBERATION ABOUT THE CONTENT OF LEGAL NORMS.
110	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE PROBLEM OF PLACE DETERMINATION OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS PROTECTION SYSTEM. THE EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS IN THIS SPHERE, IN PARTICULAR: THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS; THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS; THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS; THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE HAS PROVED THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE MAINLY AIMED AT ENSURING AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CITIZEN CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN ALL SPHERES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. THEIR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE THE RULE OF LAW AND ORDER AS WELL AS TO EFFECT THE SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE STATE IN THE WHOLE TERRITORY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES ARE PROVED TO HAVE AUTHORITY TO USE LEGAL MEASURES AIMED AT THE LIMITATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND IT IS REFLECTED AT THE LEVEL OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. ALSO, IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT AT THE LEVEL OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MUST SECURE INDEPENDENTLY VOLUMES, COMPLETENESS, AND BOARDERS OF MEASURES UNDERTOOK BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO LIMIT LEGALLY A NUMBER OF CIVIL RIGHTS. ALL SUCH CASES MUST BE SPECIFIED AND WRITTEN IN LAWS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO AVOID MISUNDERSTANDING. THE CONCLUSION HAS BEEN REACHED THAT LIMITS, AND MEASURES APPLIED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO RESTRICT THE CIVIL RIGHTS, MUST BE ADAPTIVE, FLEXIBLE, AND NOT SO DETAILED IN LAW BUT SHOWN IN PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS OF POLICE WORK. THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EFFICIENCY AND LIMITS OF THE POSSIBLE LIMITATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE CARRIED OUT UNDER THE CONTROL AND MONITORING ON THE PART OF CIVIL SOCIETY INSTITUTES. SUCH MONITORING AND CONTROL ARE AIMED AT SECURING PERMANENT CORRECTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MODEL IN THE SPHERE OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS PROTECTION.
111	DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCREASINGLY LEADING TO THE NEED FOR THEIR REFLECTION IN LAW. ON THE ONE HAND, SOCIAL RELATIONS ARE CHANGING, WHICH ARE REGULATED BY LAW, WHICH INEVITABLY ENTAILS THE APPEARANCE IN THE LEGISLATION OF INDICATIONS OF NEW FACTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMERGENCE, CHANGE AND TERMINATION OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT, THE INTRODUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN OBJECTS AND SUBJECTS OF LEGAL RELATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LAW ITSELF IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE VOLUMINOUS, SINCE IT IS DETAILED BY THE LEGISLATOR IN RESPONSE TO THE QUANTITATIVELY INCREASING DEMANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE MOST COMPLETE PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS IN CONDITIONS THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. AS A RESULT, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROVISIONS FORMING THE RULE OF LAW IS LENGTHENED AND COMPLICATED, AND THEIR APPLICATION, COMPLIANCE, EXECUTION AND USE BECOME DIFFICULT. THEREFORE, THERE ARE ELECTRONIC REFERENCE AND LEGAL BASES, INTERNET RESOURCES, PROGRAMS FOR COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDE ORIENTATION OPPORTUNITIES IN THE REGULATORY MATERIAL. ALGORITHMS AND PLATFORMS ARE ALSO CREATED THAT ACT AS A MEANS OF PERFORMING ACTIONS, THE ORDER OF WHICH IS ENSHRINED IN LAW. GRADUALLY, THE LAW TAKES ON A MACHINE-READABLE LOOK, AND ITS FULL DIGITAL LOOK IS POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE. PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF DIGITAL FORMALIZATION OF CIVIL LAW AT THE MOMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IN PROGRAMMING LAW AS A MULTI-LEVEL SYSTEM USED IN THE REGULATION MECHANISM OF PUBLIC RELATIONS. PROMISING IS THE DIRECTION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AS THE "ONTOLOGY OF BILLS" OR REQUESTS FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION. SUCH A MECHANISM SHALL CONTAIN WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS THAT PEOPLE USE WHEN FORMULATING A SITUATION THAT HAS FORCED THEM TO APPLY FOR LEGAL REGULATION. IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE ONTOLOGY, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH THE DECISION MADE BY THE COURT IS STATED IN AN UNDERSTANDABLE FORM. IN ANY CASE, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS MECHANISM, ONE CAN GET ONLY A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW THE LEGALLY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS ARE REFLECTED IN LAWS. THE ACCURACY OF LEGAL ONTOLOGY CAN ONLY BE GUARANTEED ON A DOGMATIC BASIS.
112	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE MATERIALS OF THE MAGAZINE "HERALD OF EUROPE" - ONE OF THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE PERIODICALS OF LIBERAL ORIENTATION OF THE XIX CENTURY. STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF THE CATALOGUE OF THE CONTENTS OF THE LOGS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD (1866-1918), AS WELL AS OF THE PUBLICATIONS THEMSELVES, HELPED TO BUILD A "LIBERAL MODEL" INTERPRETATION OF THE AUTHORS OF THE JOURNAL'S STATUS, POSITION, PECULIARITIES AND PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF SIBERIAN REGION. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE AUTHORS AND THE EDITORIAL OFFICE CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT OF SIBERIA: HOPE FOR THE TRIUMPH OF OPENNESS AND THE RULE OF LAW AS A GUARANTEE OF PREVENTION OF ABUSES BY THE AUTHORITIES; THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEIR RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS; BELIEF IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF EDUCATION, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EDUCATION OF THE POPULATION OF THE SIBERIAN PROVINCE; THE DESIRE TO ATTRACT MORE OF THE PUBLIC TO THE SOLUTION OF LEGAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF THE SIBERIAN REGION, TO A CIVILIZED DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHORITIES. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE EDITORS AND AUTHORS OF THE JOURNAL AS THE KEY PROBLEMS OF THE SIBERIAN REGION WERE CONSIDERED: THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BASE REGULATING THE LEGAL STATUS OF SIBERIA; THE LOW LEVEL OF LITERACY AMONG THE POPULATION; LACK OF HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION UNTIL THE OPENING OF TOMSK UNIVERSITY; SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INTO LOW TERRITORY; THE ARBITRARINESS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE COMMON PEOPLE; THE HARSH CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND THE LIFE OF THE EXILES, CONVICTS AND SETTLERS, ETC. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE ARTICLES CONTAINED MANY SENTENCES; INCREASING INDEPENDENCE OF LOCAL PRINT MEDIA; IMPROVING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK REGULATING THE STATUS AND POSITION OF THE SIBERIAN TERRITORY AND ITS POPULATION, ETC. WHILE PUBLICISTS REGULARLY EMPHASIZED THE URGENT NEED OF EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLES OF SIBERIA AS A GUARANTEE OF THEIR CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROSPERITY IN THE FUTURE.
113	THE ACCESSION OF CROATIA TO THE EUROPEAN UNION IS YET ANOTHER MILESTONE IN THE HISTORY OF EU ENLARGEMENTS. AFTER SEVEN ENLARGEMENT ROUNDS THE MEMBERSHIP HAS INCREASED FROM THE ORIGINAL SIX FOUNDING COUNTRIES TO TWENTY-EIGHT MEMBER STATES. MANY CLAIM, QUITE RIGHTLY, THAT THE ENLARGEMENT POLICY IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL OF THE EU'S FOREIGN POLICY TOOLS. EVEN THOSE WHO BRING THIS BOLD ARGUMENT INTO DOUBT HAVE TO AGREE THAT, WHEN CONTRASTED WITH OTHER EXTERNAL POLICIES, AND THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY IN PARTICULAR, THE OVERALL BALANCE SHEET OF THE ENLARGEMENT POLICY IS POSITIVE. THE ACCESSION OF CROATIA IS SYMBOLIC IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. AS ARGUED IN THIS ARTICLE, IT CLOSES ONE BIG CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF EU ENLARGEMENTS BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, OPENS ANOTHER. CROATIA IS - MOST LIKELY - THE LAST COUNTRY TO JOIN THE EU THIS DECADE. AFTER A SOMETIMES PAINFUL PRE-ACCESSION PROCESS, IT HAS PROVED TO BE A 'SUCCESS STORY' OF THE STABILISATION AND ASSOCIATION PROCESS. AS THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLAIMS, IT IS LIVING PROOF THAT THE RAISON D'ETRE AND MECHANICS OF THE POLICY EMPLOYED VIS-A-VIS THE WESTERN BALKANS HAVE THEIR MERITS. HOWEVER, A QUICK LOOK INTO THE FUTURE PROVES THAT THE NEXT ENLARGEMENTS WILL BE FAR MORE COMPLICATED AFFAIRS. THE CURRENT LIST OF CANDIDATES AND POTENTIAL CANDIDATES IS A MIX OF A HEAVYWEIGHT (TURKEY) AND THE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES, ALL STRUGGLING TO MEET THE FUNDAMENTAL PREREQUISITES FOR A DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA, TOGETHER WITH A DWINDLING APPETITE FOR FURTHER ENLARGEMENT AMONG SOME MEMBER STATES, CREATE A RATHER DANGEROUS MIX. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT FOLLOWING RECENT ENHANCEMENTS TO THE PRE-ACCESSION POLICY, FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE FUTURE EXPANSIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION POSSIBLE. IF ONLY FROM THE GEO-POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS IS IN THE JOINT INTEREST OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ITS MEMBER STATES AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN BALKANS.
114	VIEWING THE CHINESE ECONOMY AS A SPEEDING CAR, THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT COULD CRASH THE CAR: (1) A HARDWARE FAILURE, WHICH IS THE BREAKDOWN OF AN ECONOMIC MECHANISM (ANALOGOUS TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE CHASSIS OF THE CAR), FOR EXAMPLE, A BANKING CRISIS; (2) A SOFTWARE FAILURE, WHICH IS A FLAW IN GOVERNANCE THAT CREATES SOCIAL DISORDERS (ANALOGOUS TO A FIGHT AMONG THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE CAR), FOR EXAMPLE, THE STATE NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE RISING SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS ABOUT ITS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE MANY OF THE KEY REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS ARE ABSENT OR INEFFECTIVE; AND (3) A POWER SUPPLY FAILURE, WHICH IS THE LOSS OF ECONOMIC VIABILITY (ANALOGOUS TO THE CAR RUNNING OUT OF GAS OR HAVING ITS IGNITION KEY PULLED OUT), FOR EXAMPLE, AN ENVIRONMENTAL COLLAPSE OR AN EXPORT COLLAPSE. THE FACT THAT CHINA HAS RECENTLY DECLARED THAT ITS MOST IMPORTANT TASK IS TO BUILD A HARMONIOUS SOCIETY (DESCRIBED AS A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AND LIVING IN HARMONY WITH NATURE) SUGGESTS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN GOVERNANCE AND PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ARE AMONG THE MOST SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE GREATEST INADEQUACY OF THE HARMONIOUS SOCIETY VISION IS THE ABSENCE OF AN OBJECTIVE TO BUILD A HARMONIOUS WORLD BECAUSE A HARMONIOUS SOCIETY CANNOT ENDURE IN CHINA UNLESS THERE IS ALSO A HARMONIOUS WORLD, AND VICE VERSA. THE LARGE AMOUNT OF STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES GENERATED BY RAPID GLOBALISATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS HAS MADE THE INTERNATIONAL ATMOSPHERE RIPE FOR TRADE PROTECTIONISM; AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION HAS MADE CONFLICT OVER THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL COMMONS MORE LIKELY. CHINA'S QUEST FOR A HARMONIOUS SOCIETY REQUIRES IT TO HELP PROVIDE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS, PARTICULARLY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE MULTILATERAL FREE-TRADE SYSTEM, AND THE PROTECTION OF THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL COMMONS. SPECIFICALLY, CHINA SHOULD WORK ACTIVELY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE DOHA ROUND AND FOR AN INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY.
115	THIS ARTICLE, PREPARED FOR AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO THE WORK OF JUDGE RICHARD A. POSNER, CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF LAW AND ECONOMICS FOR THE STRUCTURE OF SUPRANATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE APPLICATION OF COLLECTIVE ACTION THEORY TO THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG STATES IN THE EU. AFTER DISCUSSING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THIS APPROACH AND JUDGE POSNER'S WORK, THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES COLLECTIVE ACTION THEORY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATE AND OF RELATIONSHIPS AMONG STATES. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, SUPRANATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE EU CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES THAT FACILITATE COLLECTIVE ACTION AMONG STATES BY REDUCING THE TRANSACTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT COSTS OF MAKING AND IMPLEMENTING COLLECTIVE DECISIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS CREATES AGENCY COSTS FOR STATES AND THEIR PEOPLES BECAUSE THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE AND ITS PEOPLE DIVERGE FROM THE INTERESTS OF THE COLLECTIVE IN SOME INSTANCES. VIEWED IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE EU-LIKE THAT OF OTHER SUPRANATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OR FEDERAL NATION STATES-REFLECTS AN EFFORT TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN COLLECTIVE DECISION MAKING AND LOCAL CONTROL SO AS TO MAXIMIZE THE COLLECTIVE GAINS AND MINIMIZE THE RESULTING AGENCY COSTS. UNDERSTOOD IN THESE TERMS, VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE EU'S INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN MAKE SENSE. THE ORDINARY LEGISLATIVE PROCESS PERMITS THE EU TO ACT WITHOUT THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT OF MEMBER STATES, THUS REDUCING TRANSACTIONS COSTS IN THOSE AREAS WHERE COLLECTIVE ACTION IS NECESSARY, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE CREATION AND REGULATION OF THE INTERNAL MARKET. THE EU REDUCES ENFORCEMENT COSTS THROUGH PRINCIPLES OF DIRECT APPLICABILITY OR EFFECTS AND THE SUPREMACY OF EU LAW, WHICH ARE EFFECTIVE LEGAL RESTRAINTS IN STATES GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE EU ALSO INCORPORATES A REPRESENTATIVE AND DELIBERATIVE PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION THAT HELPS CONTROL THE RESULTING AGENCY COSTS FOR MEMBER STATES AND THEIR PEOPLES THROUGH SUPERMAJORITY AND CO-DECISIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THE COLLECTIVE ACTION PERSPECTIVE ALSO ILLUMINATES THE FUNCTION OF THE SUBSIDIARITY PRINCIPLE AND THE ENHANCED ROLE OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN ITS ENFORCEMENT.
116	MARKET SOCIETIES HAVE CREATED MORE WEALTH, AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE PEOPLE, THAN ANY OTHER SYSTEM OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN HISTORY. YET WE STILL HAVE A RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MARKETS THEMSELVES ARE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONS THAT REQUIRE EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. THIS GROUNDBREAKING WORK SEEKS TO FILL THIS GAP, TO MAKE SENSE OF MODERN CAPITALISM BY DEVELOPING A SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY OF MARKET INSTITUTIONS. ADDRESSING THE UNRULY DYNAMISM THAT CAPITALISM BRINGS WITH IT, LEADING SOCIOLOGIST NEIL FLIGSTEIN ARGUES THAT THE BASIC DRIFT OF ANY ONE MARKET AND ITS ACTORS, EVEN ALLOWING FOR COMPETITION, IS TOWARD STABILIZATION. "THE ARCHITECTURE OF MARKETS" REPRESENTS A MAJOR AND TIMELY STEP BEYOND RECENT, LARGELY EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT OPPOSE THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL OF PERFECT COMPETITION BUT PROVIDE SPARSE THEORY TOWARD A COHERENT ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY. FLIGSTEIN OFFERS THIS THEORY. WITH IT HE INTERPRETS NOT JUST GLOBALIZATION AND THE INFORMATION ECONOMY, BUT DEVELOPMENTS MORE SPECIFIC TO AMERICAN CAPITALISM IN THE PAST TWO DECADES - AMONG THEM, THE 1980S MERGER MOVEMENT. HE MAKES NEW INROADS INTO THE "THEORY OF FIELDS", WHICH LINKS THE FORMATION OF MARKETS AND FIRMS TO THE PROBLEMS OF STABILITY. HIS POLITICAL-CULTURAL APPROACH EXPLAINS WHY GOVERNMENTS REMAIN CRUCIAL TO MARKETS AND WHY SO MANY NATIONAL VARIATIONS OF CAPITALISM ENDURE. STATES HELP MAKE STABLE MARKETS POSSIBLE BY, FOR EXAMPLE, ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW AND ADJUDICATING THE CLASS STRUGGLE. STATE-BUILDING AND MARKETBUILDING GO HAND IN HAND. FLIGSTEIN SHOWS THAT MARKET ACTORS DEPEND MIGHTILY UPON GOVERNMENTS AND THE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY FOR THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT PRODUCE WEALTH. HE DEMONSTRATES THAT SYSTEMS FAVORING MORE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND REDISTRIBUTION CAN YIELD STABLE MARKETS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH AS READILY AS LESS EGALITARIAN SYSTEMS. THIS BOOK WILL SURELY JOIN THE CLASSICS ON CAPITALISM. ECONOMISTS, SOCIOLOGISTS, POLICYMAKERS, AND ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN WHAT MAKES MARKETS FUNCTION AS THEY DO WILL READ IT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. THE JOURNAL PUBLISHES CHAPTER 1 "BRINGING SOCIOLOGY BACK IN", IN WHICH NEIL FLIGSTEIN INDICATES KEY QUESTIONS WHICH THE SOCIOLOGY OF MARKETS SHOULD CONSIDER IN ITS PURVIEW AND WHICH HELP TO DEFINE ITS RELATION TO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF ECONOMIC THEORY.
117	PURPOSE - IN ADDITION TO CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUPPLY SIDE OF CORRUPTION IN AFRICA, THE WEST HAS HISTORICALLY PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN LAUNDERING THE PROCEEDS. THE OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTRES (OFCS) ARE CHARACTERISED AS JURISDICTIONS THAT ATTRACT A HIGH LEVEL OF NON- RESIDENT FINANCIAL ACTIVITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE HOW SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES, THEIR RELATIVES AND CLOSE ASSOCIATES HAVE USED OFCS IN MOVING FUNDS THAT MAY BE A PRODUCT OF FOREIGN CORRUPTION INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER LOCATES THE ROLE OF OFCS WITHIN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY THEORY OF GLOBALISATION TO ARGUE THAT MOBILITY OF CAPITAL HAS BEEN PROMOTED BY A NUMBER OF ADVANCED COUNTRIES AND MICRO- STATES THAT USE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND LAW- MAKING POWERS TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO ANTI- SOCIAL PRACTICES BY THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS AND THE POLITICAL ELITE. THE PAPER USES PUBLICLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO ILLUMINATE THE ROLE PLAYED BY OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTRES IN FACILITATING ELITE MONEY LAUNDERING PRACTICES. FINDINGS - THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT, IN PURSUIT OF ORGANISATIONAL AND PERSONAL INTEREST, THE OFFSHORE FINANCIAL CENTRES CREATE ENABLING STRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT ILLICIT ACTIVITIES OF THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ELITE FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONEY LAUNDERING LAWS AND THE CREATION OF ANTI- MONEY LAUNDERING AGENCIES HAD NOT BROUGHT ABOUT ETHICAL CONDUCT WITHIN THE GLOBAL BANKING SYSTEMS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY THE VOLUME OF MONEY LAUNDERED, BUT IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT MONEY LAUNDERING MAY ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS 5 PER CENT OF THE WORLD ECONOMY. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF ILLICIT MONEY UNDOUBTEDLY FLOW OUT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING IS A KEY GOAL IN ALL DEMOCRACIES, DUE TO ITS CORROSIVE EFFORTS ON THE RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AND ITS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER EXAMINES PREDATORY PRACTICES OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY IN MONEY LAUNDERING ACTIVITIES.
118	THIS PAPER READS THE U.K. GOVERNMENT'S "FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES" PROJECT ALONGSIDE TWO CHILDREN'S GOTHIC NOVELS, CORAM BOY (2000) BY JAMILA GAVIN AND CITY OF GHOSTS (2009) BY BALI RAI. IN 2011 THE U.K. GOVERNMENT OUTLINED WHAT IT DESCRIBED AS "FUNDAMENTAL BRITISH VALUES" (FBV), MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT FOR U.K. SCHOOLS TO PROMOTE THESE VALUES. MANY CRITICS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ROOT OF FBV LIES IN ISLAMOPHOBIA AND IMPERIALIST NOSTALGIA AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PROMOTION OF "BRITISH" VALUES IN SCHOOL WILL EXCLUDE MINORITY GROUPS ALREADY UNDER SIEGE FROM RACIST ELEMENTS IN CONTEMPORARY BRITAIN. OTHER CRITICS ARGUE THAT THE PROMOTION OF FBV REDUCES OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE ISSUES OF BELONGING, BELIEF, AND NATIONHOOD IN THE CLASSROOM. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE GOTHIC FICTIONS OF JAMILA GAVIN AND BALI RAI OFFER A SPACE IN WHICH TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE BRITISH HISTORY (AND SO, ITS VALUES) IN A WAY THAT IS ACUTELY RELEVANT TO THESE EDUCATION CONTEXTS. CORAM BOY AND CITY OF GHOSTS USE THE GOTHIC TO INTERROGATE ASPECTS OF BRITISH HISTORY ELIDED BY THE FBV PROJECT. THAT IS, THEY POINT TO BRITAIN'S IMPERIAL AND COLONIAL HISTORY AND OFFER A REJOINDER TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INSISTENCE THAT "BRITISH VALUES" EQUATE TO DEMOCRACY, RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND MUTUAL RESPECT AND TOLERANCE OF THOSE FROM DIFFERENT FAITHS AND RELIGIONS. FURTHERMORE, GAVIN'S AND RAI'S USE OF THE GOTHIC CREATES A SPACE IN WHICH THE AMBIGUITIES AND CONTRADICTIONS INHERENT IN FBV CAN BE EXPLORED. HOWEVER, THEIR "GOTHICIZED" HISTORIES OF BRITAIN DO NOT RENDER THE IDEA OF SHARED VALUES INVALID. THE DIVERSITY AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE CHARACTERS OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF IDENTITY TO THE PATRONISING AND ARROGANT FBV PROJECT, WHICH IS AIMED AT PROMOTING A NATIONAL IDENTITY BASED ON SAMENESS AND ASSIMILATION. RAI AND GAVIN LOOK TO BRITAIN'S PAST THROUGH THE LENS OF THE GOTHIC NOT ONLY TO REFUTE NATIONALISM AND RACISM, BUT ALSO TO OFFER A PRODUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE THAT GESTURES TOWARDS A MORE COSMOPOLITAN VISION OF IDENTITY.
119	PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE WHETHER SANCTIONING ADOPTION OF IFRS FOR US FIRMS WOULD PRODUCE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION OF THE SAME QUALITY AS THOSE PRODUCED UNDER US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). THIS IS A TIMELY RESEARCH SINCE THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC; 2014) HAS ASKED FOR FURTHER REVIEW. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS STUDY USES RESTATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MADE BY A SAMPLE OF FOREIGN FIRMS LISTED ON US STOCK EXCHANGES USING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) IN COMPARISON TO A CONTROL SAMPLE OF US FIRMS USING US GAAP DURING THE PERIOD OF 2001 TO 2010. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FREQUENCY, SOURCES AND MAGNITUDE OF THE RESTATEMENTS AND MARKET REVALUATIONS TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESTATEMENTS ARE EXAMINED. CROSS-COUNTRY DIFFERENCES ARE ALSO EXAMINED. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT IFRS FIRMS HAVE A LOWER RATE OF RESTATEMENTS THAN US GAAP FIRMS BUT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF SOURCES OF RESTATEMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON NET INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE MARKET REVALUATIONS TO RESTATEMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ACCOUNTING REGIMES. CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES INDICATE IFRS FIRMS ARE ON AVERAGE FROM COUNTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY WEAK RULE OF LAW, INEFFECTIVE CORRUPTION CONTROLS AND LOWER EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PRIVATE SECTOR ADVANCEMENT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE SAMPLE SIZE IN THE PAPER IS RELATIVELY SMALL. TO INCREASE VALIDITY OF THE INFERENCES FROM THE RESULTS, THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE READDRESSED WITH LARGER SAMPLE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ACCOUNTING PRACTITIONERS AND POLICYMAKERS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - RESULTS ARE CONTRIBUTING IN CLARIFYING THE SEC'S CONCERNS OF ADOPTING THE IFRS BY US-BASED FIRMS; THUS, SAVING THE INVESTORS THE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS AND COSTS IN COMPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING REGIMES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS RESEARCH IS THE FIRST TO USE RESTATEMENTS AS ACCOUNTING QUALITY CRITERIA. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOPTION OF IFRS BY US-BASED FIRMS WOULD NOT PRODUCE ACCOUNTING INFORMATION THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN QUALITY FROM THOSE GENERATED UNDER US GAAP. THIS RESULT SHOULD BE OF INTEREST TO THE SEC IN CLARIFYING ITS CONCERNS.
120	THE REALITY OF THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE DIVERGES CONSIDERABLY FROM THE SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA) AND CLASSIC JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAT FOLLOWED THE APA REVIEWING AGENCY ACTIONS. THOSE ASSUMPTIONS CALL FOR STATUTORY DIRECTIVES TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY ONE AGENCY LED BY SENATE-CONFIRMED PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTEES WITH DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY. THE IMPLEMENTATION (IN THE FORM OF A DISCRETE ACTION) IS PRESUMED TO BE THROUGH STATUTORILY MANDATED PROCEDURES AND CRITERIA, WITH JUDICIAL REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE AGENCY AT THE TIME OF ITS ACTION MATCH THE DELEGATED DIRECTIONS. THIS IS THE LOST WORLD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, THOUGH IT IS WHAT STUDENTS LARGELY STILL LEARN. TODAY, THERE ARE OFTEN STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVES TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY MULTIPLE AGENCIES OFTEN MISSING CONFIRMED LEADERS, WHERE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY MAY REST OUTSIDE OF THOSE AGENCIES. THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION IS ALSO THROUGH MANDATES IN BOTH STATUTES AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS, WHERE THE FINAL RESULT FACES LIMITED, IF ANY, OVERSIGHT BY THE COURTS. THE MISMATCH HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LEGITIMACY AND EFFICACY OF THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY: SOME POSITIVE, MANY NEGATIVE. BECAUSE WE DO NOT THINK A RETURN TO THE LOST WORLD IS POSSIBLE OR PERHAPS EVEN DESIRABLE, WE PROPOSE SOME POSSIBLE REFORMS IN ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STRENGTHEN THE MATCH BETWEEN CURRENT REALITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND TO FURTHER ADMINISTRATIVE LAW'S OBJECTIVES OF TRANSPARENCY, RULE OF LAW, AND REASONED IMPLEMENTATION OF STATUTORY MANDATES. WE ALSO HOPE THAT THE PROPOSED REFORMS CAN HELP FOSTER THE PUBLIC INTEREST GOALS OF MODERN REGULATION, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OR FINANCIAL STABILITY. WE REALIZE THAT MANY SCHOLARS AND PROBABLY AT LEAST SOME JUDGES ARE AWARE THAT FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, OFFICIAL RECORDS, AND JUDICIAL REVIEW ARE ONLY PART OF THE DYNAMICS OF ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE. BUT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AS DEVELOPED BY THE COURTS AND IN GOVERNING STATUTES, HAS NOT MEANINGFULLY CONFRONTED THE CONTEMPORARY REALITIES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. IT THUS RISKS BECOMING IRRELEVANT TO THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE.
121	WE LIVE IN A UNIPOLAR WORLD NOT ONLY POLITICALLY AND MILITARILY, BUT INTELLECTUALLY TOO WITH GLOBALISATION ATTAINING THE STATUS OF DOGMA. AS GLOBALISATION HAS NOT ALWAYS HELPED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SWADESHI, OR SELF-RELIANCE, HAS BEEN STRONGLY ADVOCATED BY INFLUENTIAL GROUPS IN INDIA. LOGICALLY, THERE IS SPACE FOR BOTH: GLOBALISATION FOR IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS OF TRADEABLES, AND SWADESHI FOR MAXIMISING EMPLOYMENT THROUGH NON-TRADEABLES. INDIA HAS BEEN GROWING WELL BUT NOT AS WELL IT COULD BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE IMPEDANCE TO GROWTH. IMPEDANCE HAS THREE COMPONENTS: WEIGHT OF TRADITION, RELUCTANCE TO CHANGE, AND FRICTION AGAINST MOVEMENT. POSITIVE FEEDBACK IN THE FORM OF LOCAL AUTONOMY HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A REMEDY. AS POSITIVE FEEDBACK IS INHERENTLY UNSTABLE, IT SHOULD BE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. INTEGRAL FEEDBACK, INTEGRATING OVER ALL LOCAL UNITS COMBINED TOGETHER, AND OVER TIME, SHOULD MINIMISE RISK OF INSTABILITY. APART FROM LOCAL AUTONOMY, INDIA WILL PROGRESS FAST ONLY IF BUREAUCRACY IS ASSURED SECURITY. IN PARTICULAR, FREQUENT, ARBITRARY AND OFTEN VINDICTIVE TRANSFERS OF OFFICIALS HAVE BECOME A DREADED MENACE. THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. POLITICIANS HAVE BECOME A PROBLEM; MANY OF THEM BANK ON PROMOTING HATRED. AS A REMEDY, EACH VOTER MAY BE GIVEN AS MANY VOTES AS THERE ARE CANDIDATES, AND ALSO THE OPTION TO MAKE EACH VOTE EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. THEN, ANY HATE VOTE GAINED WILL BE NULLIFIED BY THE NEGATIVE VOTES. HATE WILL CEASE TO BE PROFITABLE. PRESIDENT KALAM'S PROPOSAL FOR SHIFTING INVESTMENT FROM CONGESTED CITIES TO RURAL AREAS BY LINKING LOOPS OF VILLAGES BY FOUR TYPES OF CONNECTIVITY PHYSICAL, ELECTRONIC, ECONOMIC AND KNOWLEDGE-PROMISES TO HASTEN INDIA'S GROWTH, AND IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT TOO.

122	FOR ALMOST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE, ITS JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN REFORMED REPEATEDLY. HOWEVER, IT WAS THE REFORM OF ALEXANDER II THAT HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT, INCLUDING ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN MODERN RUSSIA. AS A RESULT OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION, THE REFORMED RUSSIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS NEVER LAGGED BEHIND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF THE MOST ADVANCED WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OF THAT TIME. THIS WORK IS DEVOTED TO THE COMPARATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BEFORE AND AFTER THE JUDICIAL REFORM OF ALEXANDER II, CARRIED OUT IN 1864. THE STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY, IN WHICH THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE STATE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE BEFORE THE REFORM OF 1864. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE KEY PROBLEMS AND THE MAIN REASONS THAT SERVED AS PREREQUISITES FOR ALEXANDER II'S DECISION ON THE NEED FOR A COMPLETE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE. THE AUTHOR INVESTIGATED SUCH PRE-REFORM PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE AS THE ESTATE PRINCIPLE, THE PRINCIPLE OF PRESUMPTION OF GUILT, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE PRINCIPLE OF EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLE OF SECRECY OF THE TRIAL. IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE FORM AND NATURE OF THE APPLICATION OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MAIN SHORTCOMINGS OF THE PRE-REFORM PERIOD OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, SUCH AS CORRUPTION, LOW QUALIFICATIONS OF JUDGES, LACK OF INDEPENDENCE, AS WELL AS THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THE AUTHOR ALSO CONSIDERS EARLIER ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, NAMELY THE PROJECTS OF M.M. SPERANSKY DURING THE REIGN OF EMPERORS ALEXANDER I, AS WELL AS THE IDEAS OF D.N. BLUDOV DURING THE REIGN OF EMPEROR NICHOLAS I.
123	THE ORGANIZATION OF PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION IN GENERAL TERMS CAN BE DEFINED AS CREATING CONDITIONS FOR PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION AND IMPLEMENTING IT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW IN PLACES OF FORCED ISOLATION. THE DIRECTIONS OF PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION ARE DETERMINED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SUBJECT AND LIMITS OF SUPERVISION; THEY ARE BASED ON A SUBJECT-OBJECT APPROACH. OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING THE DESIGN OF PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION IS THE CONTENT OF SPECIFIC MEASURES OF COMPULSORY ISOLATION AND THE NATURE OF THE BODIES AND INSTITUTIONS (PLACES) THAT IMPLEMENT THESE MEASURES. THEREFORE, STRUCTURAL DIRECTIONS SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE DESIGN OF PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION THAT COVER THE SUPERVISION OVER THE LEGALITY OF IMPLEMENTING ALL EXISTING MEASURES OF COMPULSORY ISOLATION AND THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BODIES AND INSTITUTIONS (PLACES) THAT IMPLEMENT THEM. TO DATE, THE FOLLOWING ISSUES OF ORGANIZATION (IMPLEMENTATION) OF PROSECUTOR'S SUPERVISION OVER THE LEGALITY OF IMPLEMENTING PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION REMAIN UNCOVERED (OR INSUFFICIENTLY COVERED): DETENTION OF SUSPECTS; CONFINEMENT IN THE GUARDHOUSE AS THE EXECUTION OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL DETENTION AND/OR PRELIMINARY DETENTION; CONVOY AND TRANSPORTATION OF CONVICTS AND OTHER PERSONS SERVING COMPULSORY ISOLATION; OPERATIONAL-SEARCH AND CRIMINAL-PROCEDURAL ACTIVITIES IN PLACES OF FORCED ISOLATION, ETC. THE STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF SUPERVISION OVER THE LEGALITY OF PENITENTIARY ISOLATION INCLUDES: THE LEGALITY OF BEING IN PLACES OF COMPULSORY ISOLATION (THIS COVERS, INTER ALIA, THE LEGALITY OF PLACEMENT, RELOCATION, AND RELEASE) AND THE ENSURING OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGAL STATUS OF PERSONS SERVING COMPULSORY ISOLATION (THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE PROCEDURE AND CONDITIONS FOR SERVING IT). IN ADDITION, WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS, ISSUES RELATED TO THE CONDUCT OF PROSECUTOR'S INSPECTIONS ARE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE DESIGN OF PENITENTIARY SUPERVISION CONSISTS IN THE MAXIMUM COVERAGE OF THE DIRECTIONS OF PROSECUTOR'S SUPERVISION OVER THE LEGALITY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PENITENTIARY ISOLATION MEASURES, IN THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR ORGANIZATION (CONTENT), AND IN THE REORGANIZATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIALIZED PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE ON SUPERVISING THE OBSERVANCE OF LAWS IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
124	NUMERICAL MEASURES INDICATE THAT CORRUPTION IS GENERALLY HIGHER IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH ENERGY ASSETS (OIL, GAS AND COAL) AS OPPOSED TO NON-ENERGY ASSET DEVELOPING NATIONS. THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY AS-SET MEANS THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN EFFECTIVELY GAUGE THEIR NATIONS RESERVES TO PRODUCTION RATIO WHICH CAN STRENGTHEN THEIR NEGOTIATING POWERS WITH INDUSTRIES IN THE EXTRACTIVE SECTOR TO EARN MORE FUTURE INCOME, CREATING A FERTILE GROUND FOR CORRUPTION TO EMERGE. HENCE, WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESENCE OF ENERGY ASSETS FUELS MORE CORRUPTION IS AN AREA OF RESEARCH THAT IS OVERLOOKED THAT DESERVES FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF ENERGY ASSETS ON CORRUPTION IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. THE STUDIES EMPIR-ICAL METHODOLOGY INVOLVES THE ESTIMATION OF A REDUCED FORM EQUATION UTILISING WEALTH ACCOUNTS DATA ON ENERGY ASSETS (OIL, NATURAL GAS AND COAL) IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE ITS EFFECT ON CORRUPTION WHILE SIMULTANE-OUSLY CONTROLLING FOR NATIONS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE. BASED ON THE HETEROSKEDASTICITY-CONSISTENT COVARIANCE MATRIX REGRESSION METHODOLOGY, THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION OF OIL ON CORRUPTION FOR THE YEARS 2005, 2010 AND 2014. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION OF COAL AND NATURAL GAS ON CORRUPTION FOR 2005. THE FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE FUNDA-MENTALLY ESSENTIAL VARIABLES IN CONTROLLING CORRUPTION. THIS STUDY'S MAIN POLICY IMPLICATION IS THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENTS TO INSTITUTE CREDIBLE ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES IN THE ENERGY-RELATED RESOURCE INDUSTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS, INCLUDING LEGISLATIONS OF STRONG ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS WHERE INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS ENGAGED IN CORRUPT PRACTICES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE SEIZURE OF INCOMES AND ASSETS ACQUIRED THROUGH CORRUPT MEANS, IMPOSING SEVERE FINANCIAL PENALTIES, MONITORING AND ACCOUNT-ABILITY OF ORIGIN OF OFFSHORE PAYMENTS BY INTERNATIONAL FIRMS AND BANKS AND CLOSURE OF FIRMS ENGAGED IN CORRUPTION ARE SOME OF THE PRACTICAL MEASURES FORWARD THAT CAN LEAD TO THE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF SUB-SOIL ENERGY ASSETS.

125	THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE QUESTIONS OF JUDICIALIZATION OF POLITICS AND POLITICIZATION OF LAW HAVING AS BACKGROUND THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL CONSOLIDATION OF A FASCIST PERSPECTIVE CHARACTERIZED AS ANTI-SYSTEMIC, ANTI-INSTITUTIONAL, ANTI-JURIDICAL AND INFRALEGAL JURIDICAL-POLITICAL PERSONALISM, WHICH IS STREAMLINED BY THE IMPLOSION OF JUDICIARY FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE EXACTLY BY POLITICIZATION OF LAW, WITH ITS DIRECT LINK TO THE FRATRICIDE POLITICAL-PARTISAN WAR IN THE SPHERE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. FROM THIS STARTING POINT, WE WILL RECONSTRUCT THE NORMATIVE-INSTITUTIONAL-PROCEDURAL FUNDAMENTS PROPER TO THE PLURALIST AND UNIVERSALIST DEMOCRACY CONSTITUTED AS A PUBLIC SYSTEM OF LAW, WHICH ARE: THE ORIGINAL CORRELATION AND THE CONCOMITANT EMERGENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND LAW; THE ONTOGENETIC PRIMACY, DIFFERENTIATION, AUTONOMY, SELF-REFERENTIALITY AND OVERPOSITION OF LAW REGARDING TO POLITICS AND MORAL, AS WELL AS THE SUBSIDIARITY OF POLITICS AND MORAL TO LAW; THE SEPARATION, AUTONOMY, SELF-SUBSISTENCE AND OVERPOSITION OF JUDICIARY IN RELATION TO POLITICAL SYSTEM; THE SYSTEMIC, SYSTEMATIC, PROCEDURAL, MEDIATED, INSTANTIAL, PROGRESSIVE, NEUTRAL AND APOLITICAL-DEPOLITICIZED CONDITION OF JUDICIARY AND POLITICAL SYSTEM; THE STRONG SYSTEMIC IDEAL OF INSTITUTIONALITY, LEGALITY, TECHNICALITY, FORMALITY AND DEPERSONALIZATION; THE AXIOLOGICAL POSTURE OF IMPARTIALITY, IMPERSONALITY, NEUTRALITY AND APOLITICITY-DEPOLITICIZATION BY JUDICIARY AND POLITICAL SYSTEM. THESE FUNDAMENTS HAVE THE GOAL OF STRENGTHENING THE SELF-REFLEXIVE, SELF-CONTROLLED AND SELF-CORRECTIVE INSTITUTIONAL PRODUCTION OF THE UNIVERSALITY IN/AS/BY LEGALITY AND, IN THIS SENSE, THEY IMPLICATE IN THE CONSTITUTION OF AN ANTI-FASCIST, ANTI-TOTALITARIAN, NON-FUNDAMENTALIST AND ANTI-RACIST DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW WHICH FIGHTS AGAINST BOTH ANTI-SYSTEMIC, ANTI-INSTITUCIONAL, ANTI-JURIDICAL AND INFRALEGAL JURIDICAL-POLITICAL PERSONALISM, AS THE POLITICIZATION, PARTISANSHIP AND REIFICATION OF LAW, ENSURING THE CENTRALITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS, OF PLURALISM, OF LEGAL PROCESS AND OF THE LAW AS DEFINING PRINCIPLE, PROCEDURE, LANGUAGE AND SYMBOL OF THE OWN PLURALIST AND UNIVERSALIST DEMOCRACY CONSTITUTED AS A PUBLIC SYSTEM OF LAW. NOW, THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THESE FUNDAMENTS IS A VERY URGENT MATTER IN ORDER TO SOLIDIFY THEORETICALLY AND NORMATIVELY A PERSPECTIVE OF FACING AND DECONSTRUCTION OF THE FASCISM HEGEMONIC INSTITUTIONALLY AND SOCIALLY.
126	THIS PAPER EXAMINES LISA AUSTIN'S (2015) CONCEPT OF LAWFUL ILLEGALITY, WHICH INTERROGATES THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS FOR POTENTIALLY UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES BY UNITED STATES (US) SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT) AGENCIES. LAWFUL ILLEGALITY INVOLVES THE TECHNICALLY LAWFUL OPERATION OF SURVEILLANCE POWERS THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED UNLAWFUL WHEN EXAMINED THROUGH A RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK. WE ARGUE LAWFUL ILLEGALITY IS EXPANDING INTO DOMESTIC POLICING THROUGH JUDICIAL DECISIONS THAT SANCTION COMPLEX AND TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED FORMS OF REMOTE ONLINE SURVEILLANCE, SUCH AS THE USE OF MALWARE, REMOTE HACKING, OR NETWORK INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES (NITS). OPERATION PACIFIER TARGETED AND DISMANTLED THE PLAYPEN DARK WEB SITE, WHICH WAS USED FOR DISTRIBUTING CHILD EXPLOITATION MATERIAL (CEM), AND HAS GENERATED MANY JUDICIAL RULINGS EXAMINING THE LEGALITY OF REMOTE SURVEILLANCE BY THE FBI. WE HAVE SELECTED TWO CONTRASTING CASES THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW US DOMESTIC COURTS HAVE EMPLOYED DISTINCT LOGICS TO DETERMINE THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE COLLECTED THROUGH THE NIT DEPLOYED IN OPERATION PACIFIER. THE FIRST CASE, UNITED STATES V. CARLSON (2017 US DIST. LEXIS 67991), OFFERS A CRITICAL VIEW OF THE USE OF NITS BY THE FBI, WITH PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY CONSTRAINING THE LEGALITY OF THIS FORM OF SURVEILLANCE IN US CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. THE SECOND CASE, UNITED STATES V. GAYER (2017 US DIST. LEXIS 44757), AUTHORIZES THE USE OF NITS BECAUSE THE NEED TO CONTROL CRIME IS BELIEVED TO JUSTIFY SUSPENDING THE GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS ON POLICE SURVEILLANCE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION AND DISSEMINATION OF CEM. WE ARGUE THIS CRIME CONTROL EMPHASIS EXPANDS THE REACH OF US POLICE SURVEILLANCE WHILE UNDERMINING DUE PROCESS OF LAW BY REMOVING THE PROTECTIVE FUNCTION OF GEOGRAPHY. WE CONCLUDE BY SUGGESTING THE PERMISSIVE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF POLICE SURVEILLANCE REFLECTED IN UNITED STATES V. GAYER (2017 US DIST. LEXIS 44757), AND MANY OTHER PLAYPEN CASES, ERODES DUE PROCESS FOR ALL CRIME SUSPECTS, BUT IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR PEOPLE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE US, AND SUGGEST A NEUTRAL TRANSNATIONAL ARBITER COULD HELP LIMIT CONTENTIOUS FORMS OF REMOTE EXTRATERRITORIAL POLICE SURVEILLANCE.
127	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL BIOGRAPHY, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL VIEWS AS WELL AS THE INTELLECTUAL HERITAGE OF CARL FRIEDRICH GOERDELER (1884-1945), THE MAYOR OF LEIPZIG (1930-1936) AND STATE COMMISSAR FOR PRICE CONTROL (1931-1932; 1934-1935). AT THE END OF THE 1930S HE BECAME ONE OF THE KEY FIGURES OF THE CIVIL RESISTANCE MOVEMENT IN NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY. BASED ON MANY YEARS OF HIS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, HIS VIEWS AND VALUE SYSTEM, THE AUTHORITATIVE LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE BOURGEOIS WING OF THE GERMAN ANTI-TOTALITARIAN OPPOSITION SPOKE OUT WITH OPEN CRITICISM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC POLICIES OF THE AUTHORITIES AND WARNED ABOUT THE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE DISSOLUTION OF MORAL STANDARDS AS WELL AS THE SPREAD OF CORRUPTION AND ARBITRARINESS IN THE INHUMAN POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE THIRD REICH. IN HIS MANY MEMORY AND EXPERT REPORTS, HE SOUGHT WAYS TO REORGANIZE THE ECONOMY AND THE SOCIETY OF "THE OTHER GERMANY". AFTER OVERTHROWING THE NAZI DICTATORSHIP, HE INTENDED TO TAKE THE POSITION OF GERMAN CHANCELLOR. HIS ACADEMIC COLLABORATION WITH PROFESSORS FROM FREIBURG - THE ARCHITECTS OF THE THEORY OF "EFFECTIVE COMPETITION ORDER" - WITH WHOM HE INTENSELY DISCUSSED THE PERSPECTIVE OF INSTITUTIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE IN GERMANY AFTER THE FALL OF THE TOTALITARIAN REGIME, ALLOWS US TO INDIRECTLY RANK THIS OPPOSITION POLITICIAN AMONG THE IDEOLOGICAL FORERUNNERS OF THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY IN THE EARLY FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY. AFTER THE FAILURE OF THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST HITLER ON JULY 20, 1944, GOERDELER WAS ARRESTED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH. THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT IN FEBRUARY 1945 IN THE BERLIN PLOETZENSEE PRISON. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ACQUAINT THE RUSSIAN READER WITH LESS-KNOWN ASPECTS OF THE LIFE AND WORK OF A PROMINENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CIVILIAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT IN NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMANY AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF RIGHT-CONSERVATIVE IDEAS REGARDING THE PRINCIPLES OF STATE ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC POLICY, AND IN GENERAL TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PECULIARITY OF THE GERMAN INTELLECTUAL OPPOSITION THOUGHT.
128	CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE CODE OF NEGOTIATION ETHICS FOR LAWYERS IS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. THE LAW SOCIETY OF UPPER CANADA'S RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT CURRENTLY OFFERS LITTLE GUIDANCE REGARDING APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR OF LAWYERS DURING NEGOTIATIONS. DETRACTORS ARGUE THAT THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS TOO COMPLEX AND FLUID TO BE CODIFIED. THIS CRITICISM IS NOT FATAL TO THE CASE FOR A CODE OF NEGOTIATION ETHICS. LAWYERS HAVE MORAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS WITHIN THE PROFESSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PUBLIC AS CONDUITS TO LEGAL REMEDIES. THIS PAPER ARGUES A CODE OF LEGAL ETHICS IS NECESSARY TO UPHOLD THESE STANDARDS. SUCH A FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION WITH A VIEW TO HONEST DISCLOSURE AND EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES. DEVELOPING A NEGOTIATION ETHIC IS INTEGRAL TO ADDRESSING THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE CONCOMITANT RULE OF LAW PROBLEM IDENTIFIED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN HRYNIAK V MAULDIN. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED GUIDELINES FOR NEGOTIATIONS.

129	TWO INTERCONNECTED TRENDS CHARACTERISTIC FOR TODAY RUSSIA ARE ANALYZED. FIRST TENDENCY EMPHASIZING OF THE ROLE OF LAW - THE "DICTATORSHIP OF LAWS" (ACCORDING PUTIN'S EXPRESSION) WHICH MEANS A POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT REPLACED THE STRATEGY OF BUILDING A RULE-OF-LAW STATE IN RUSSIA, PROCLAIMED IN THE LATE 1980S. THE SECOND TENDENCY - SEARCHING FOR VALUES THAT DISTINGUISH RUSSIA FROM WEST. THE ORDER AND SPECIFIC RUSSIAN VALUES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE TO TRADITIONAL NORMS OF CONDUCT, CONSECRATED BY THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. THESE NORMS ARE FIXED AND STRENGTHENED BY MEANS OF LAW- MAKING INITIATIVES OF THE STATE DUMA OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SUCH AS CONCEPTION OF THE STATE FAMILY POLICY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION UNTIL 2025 AS WELL AS THE LAW ON OFFENDING RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF THE FAITHFUL AND THE LAW ON THE PROHIBITION OF PROPAGANDA OF "NON-TRADITIONAL SEXUAL RELATIONS" AMONG MINORS - BOTH LAWS WERE TAKEN BY THE STATE DUMA AND SIGNED BY THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ON JUNE 2013. ALL THREE DOCUMENTS AS A WHOLE CONSTITUTE AN IDEOLOGICAL DISCOURSE THAT NOT ONLY TENDS TO DOMINATE THE PUBLIC SPHERE BUT CLAIMS A MONOPOLY THERE. HOWEVER, SUCH LAW- MAKING INITIATIVES INTENDED TO CONSOLIDATE THE RUSSIAN SOCIETY ON THE BASIS OF TRADITIONAL IDEAS AND GIVE A "MODEL FOR THE SOCIAL REALITY" ARE CAUSING OPPOSITION, CREATING NEW CONFLICTS AND STRENGTHENING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE MAIN FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONFLICT OVER THE PROBLEM OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS OF "NON-TRADITIONAL SEXUAL ORIENTATION" AND OF THE RIGHTS OF HOMOSEXUALS. PRESENTED ON PUBLIC DISCUSSION THESE THEMES GENERATE, ON THE ONE HAND, A MORAL PANIC AND AGGRESSIVE REJECTION AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DESIRE TO "CLOSE" THE DEBATE, TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PUBLIC SPHERE BOTH THE PROBLEM ITSELF AND THE SEXUAL MINORITY APPEALING TO THE RIGHT AND REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT EQUALITY. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE LATENT FUNCTION OF A "DICTATORSHIP OF THE LAWS" IS ITS FOCUS ON SHAPING A SOLIDARITY MODEL BASED ON SELECTIVE EXCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS.
130	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS A LITTLE-KNOWN TOPIC IN THE HISTORY OF THE SOCIAL THOUGHT, WHICH HAS REGAINED RELEVANCE UNDER THE PANDEMIC - THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE OUTSTANDING PHILOSOPHERS OF THE GERMAN IDEALISM ON THE CONCEPTUAL INTERPRETATION OF POLICE AS AN EARLY-MODERN FORM OF BIOPOLITICAL CONTROL. IN THE INTRODUCTORY PART, THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE CRITIQUE OF THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF POLICING BY THE CLASSICS OF THE GERMAN IDEALISM IS PARADIGMATIC FOR THE PRESENT-DAY STUDY OF THE NEW/OLD FUNCTIONS AND POWERS OF THE SANITARY-POLICE STATE CONCERNING THE MODERN CIVIL SOCIETY'S SELF-REFLECTION. IN THE FIRST PART, THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE ENLIGHTENMENT PHILOSOPHY AND THE 'SCIENCE OF POLICING' DEVELOPED BY THE CAMERALISTS OF THE 17TH-18TH CENTURIES, AND EMPHASIZES THE SIGNIFICANT INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT THINKERS, PRIMARILY KANT'S LEGAL DOCTRINE, TO THE RADICAL INNOVATIONS IN THE POLITICAL SEMANTICS AT THE TURN OF THE 18TH-19TH CENTURIES. SUCH INNOVATIONS BECAME THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS FOR THE RULE OF LAW WHICH QUESTIONED THE DISCOURSE OF THE ABSOLUTIST STATE CONTROL OVER ITS SUBJECTS' WELFARE BY MEANS OF POLICE. IN THE SECOND PART, THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A BRIEF RECONSTRUCTION OF FICHTE'S ATTEMPTS TO COMBINE THE OLD CAMERALIST IDEAS WITH THE NEW MODERN PRINCIPLES OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AT THE END OF THE 18TH-CENTURY ERA OF THE SCIENCE OF POLICE - AFTER KANT'S EXPLICIT CRITICISM OF THE STATE CARE UNAUTHORIZED FROM BELOW. THE THIRD PART OF THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON HEGEL'S CRITIQUE: IN THE HISTORY OF THE POLITICAL THOUGHT HE WAS OFTEN CONSIDERED AN APOLOGIST OF THE AUTHORITARIAN PRUSSIAN STATE, BUT QUESTIONED THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF THE POLICE-SCIENTIFIC IDEA OF THE TOTAL BIOPOLITICAL CONTROL OVER SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES OF FREE MODERN-TYPE INDIVIDUALS. THE AUTHOR RECONSTRUCTS HEGEL'S ARGUMENTATION OF THE ABSURDITY OF THE TOTAL SANITARY-POLICE REGULATION AS SUGGESTED BY FICHTE, AND INSISTS ON THE RELEVANCE OF THESE THINKERS, CONCEPTS AND THEMATIC FIELDS FOR RECONSIDERING THE FAILURE OF THE EARLY-MODERN BIOPOLITICAL UTOPIA UNDER THE CURRENT INTERSECTIONS OF LOCKDOWNS AND SOVEREIGNTY.
131	OBJECTIVE: HAVING IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE HYPOTHESES THAT AUTHORIZE PRE-TRIAL DETENTION AND ITS CONCRETE NEED, THIS ARTICLE HAS THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF ANALYZING PRE-TRIAL DETENTION IN ECONOMIC CRIMES IN THE LIGHT OF LAW, DOCTRINE AND BRAZILIAN JURISPRUDENCE, AS A PRECAUTIONARY DETENTION OF A PROCEDURAL NATURE, TO ENSURE THE ECONOMIC ORDER. METHODOLOGY: FOR THE RESEARCH, THE ANALYTICAL-DESCRIPTIVE METHOD WAS USED TO APPROACH THEMES RELATED TO THE OBJECT OF STUDY, AS WELL AS RESEARCH INTO DOCTRINES, SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS. RESULTS: PRETRIAL DETENTION AS A GUARANTOR OF THE ECONOMIC ORDER, ACCORDING TO THE NEW WORDING OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, IS AN IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY INSTRUMENT IN THE SERVICE OF ACHIEVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN CASES OF ECONOMIC CRIMES. THESE CRIMES ARE NOT VIOLENT, BUT THEIR SOCIAL EFFECTS ARE HARMFUL AND AFFECT A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE, BECAUSE THE LEGAL GOOD THAT IS PROTECTED IS META-INDIVIDUAL. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC CRIME CONSTITUTES A BREACH OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MUST BE FOUGHT PROMPTLY AND EFFICIENTLY. FOR THIS, IF THE ACCUSED POSES A RISK TO THE INVESTIGATION OR THE PROCESS, AND IF THERE ARE NO OTHER PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES RESTRICTING FREEDOM CAPABLE OF CURBING THE HARMFULNESS OF HIS CONDUCT, HIS PREVENTIVE DETENTION MUST BE DECREED. CONTRIBUTIONS: THE CONCRETE NEED FOR PREVENTIVE DETENTION, AS A PRECAUTIONARY DETENTION OF A PROCEDURAL NATURE, TO GUARANTEE THE ECONOMIC ORDER, MUST BE OBTAINED BY IMPUTING CONDUCTS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE TO IT, BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC ORDER MUST BE CONSIDERED A FRACTION OF THE LEGAL ORDER. THEREFORE, ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST THE ECONOMIC ORDER ARE ACTS COMMITTED AGAINST THE LEGAL ORDER, IN THE EXACT TERMS OF THE CATEGORIES CONTAINED AND DESCRIBED BY THE LAWS THAT COMPOSE THEM AND, THEREFORE, SUCH LAWS MUST BE STRICTLY APPLIED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FACTS ARE BEING TREATED IN THE LEGAL FIELD. -CRIMINAL, IN WHICH EXTENSIVE INTERPRETATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED, BY VIRTUE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT CRIMINAL LAWS ONLY ADMIT EXHAUSTIVE AND RESTRICTIVE INTERPRETATION.
132	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF POPULAR-MUSIC MOVEMENTS, SUCH AS BOSSA NOVA AND TROPICALISM. I SEEK TO ANALYZE THE SIGNIFICANCE AND THE POLITICAL CONTEXT OF BRAZILIAN POPULAR MUSIC. THE ROAD AHEAD IS SOMEWHAT DESOLATE, NOT BECAUSE OF POPULAR MUSIC BUT BECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S POLITICS, WHICH ONLY RECENTLY-FROM 1985 ON-MANAGED TO BRING TO BRAZILIAN SOCIETY WHAT WE CAN FINALLY INTERPRET AS DEMOCRACY. FIRST, I LOOK AT THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF BRAZIL. WE WILL SEE THE OPPORTUNISTIC PRESENCE OF COUPS D'ETAT AND AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS THAT WEAKENED THE COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY JUST FOR POWER AND AMBITION. BOSSA NOVA LIVED THROUGH THE CREPUSCULE OF A WEAKENED DEMOCRACY, WHICH WOULD SOON BE OVERTHROWN BY THE TYRANNY OF THE MILITARY, ANXIOUS FOR POWER. THIS MOMENT IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY REGISTERED WITH SOME BOSSA NOVA COMPOSERS, WHO OPTED FOR THE PROTEST SONG, AS IT WAS KNOWN AT THE TIME, AND PASSED INTO THE HISTORY OF OUR POPULAR MUSIC WITH THIS NAME. THE USE OF VIOLENCE BY MILITARY FORCES WOULD ACT TO SILENCE THE PROTESTERS, WHO DID NOT ALIGN THEMSELVES WITH THAT AUTHORITARIAN POLICY. THE RESULT OF THESE CONFRONTATIONS IS ANALYZED IN THIS ARTICLE. TROPICALISM DID NOT HAVE THE SAME LUCK. THIS MOVEMENT WAS BORN IN 1967-PERHAPS THE MOST VIOLENT MOMENT OF MILITARY REPRESSION. HOWEVER, TROPICALISM HAD MUCH MORE OF AN AESTHETIC CONCERN WITH POETIC DISCOURSE, AND BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CENSORS UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR WRITINGS. EVEN SO, THEY ARRESTED THE TWO LEADERS OF THE MOVEMENT, GILBERTO GIL AND CAETANO VELOSO, AND SENT THEM INTO EXILE ABROAD IN JULY OF 1969. BRAZIL WAS EXPERIENCING THE HORRORS OF THE AI-5 (INSTITUTIONAL ACT 5), PROMULGATED ON DECEMBER 13, 1968, WHEN PEOPLE NO LONGER FELT SAFE-THE STATE ITSELF HAD TAKEN AWAY THIS RIGHT. THE RULE OF LAW EXISTED ONLY IN THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION; IN BRAZILIAN DAILY LIFE, THE CONSTANT THREAT OF THE MILITARY AND THE FORCED SILENCE OF SOCIETY PREVAILED.
133	ONCE RATIFIED AND PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL STATE GAZETTE, ILO CONVENTIONS FORM PART OF THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER, AND ARE RELATED TO NATIONAL LAWS THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETENCE, NOT HIERARCHY. DESPITE THEIR PECULIARITIES, ILO CONVENTIONS ARE SELF-EXECUTING IF THEY LAY DOWN CLEAR AND PRECISE RULES. CASE LAW, WHICH IS NOT A SOURCE OF LAW IN THE SPANISH LEGAL SYSTEM, IS AN APPROPRIATE MEANS OF APPLYING ILO INSTRUMENTS. THE NATIONAL JUDGE ENJOYS GREAT FLEXIBILITY WHEN APPLYING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW DRAWN FROM OR INSPIRED BY ILO INSTRUMENTS. JUDGES AND COURTS CAN ALSO APPLY THE CLEAR AND PRECISE RULES LAID DOWN IN THE ILO CONVENTIONS. IN ADDITION TO CASES OF SECUNDUM OR PRAETER LEGEM APPLICATION, IN WHICH THE JUDGE OR COURT APPLIES THE PRINCIPLES OR RULES CONTAINED IN ILO CONVENTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTED BY THE ILO OR TO FILL GAPS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, THERE MAY ALSO BE CONTRA LEGEM APPLICATION OR CASE LAW, WHEN INTERNATIONAL LABOUR LAW INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN DIRECTLY APPLICABLE RULES THAT ARE CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF NATIONAL LAW, WHETHER IT PREDATES OR POST-DATES THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE CONVENTION. IN SHORT, THERE MAY BE CASES OF APPLICATION OF THE ILO INSTRUMENT ACCORDING TO, OUTSIDE OR CONTRARY TO NATIONAL LAW, WHICH RESULT IN A REINFORCEMENT, A BROADENING OR EXTENSION OR, FINALLY, A CORRECTION OF NATIONAL LAW. IN A SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW, JUDGES AND COURTS MUST EXERCISE WITH INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM OF JUDGEMENT THE POWERS DERIVING FROM THE RESERVATION OF JURISDICTION, AND MAY CARRY OUT A CONTROL OF CONVENTIONALITY OR COMPATIBILITY OF DOMESTIC LAW WITH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, RESULTING IN THE NON-APPLICATION OR DISPLACEMENT OF DOMESTIC LAW THAT ENCROACHES ON THE COMPETENCE OF THE ILO CONVENTION BY LOWERING THE MINIMUM STANDARD IT ESTABLISHES, BUT WITHOUT ENGAGING IN AN ALTERNATIVE USE OF THE LAW OR IN CASE LAW GUIDED BY IDEOLOGICAL PREJUDICES.
134	THE DEBATE OVER THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY-THE THEORY THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE SOLE CONTROL OVER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT-HAS PROVEN EXTREMELY PAROCHIAL. SUPPORTERS OF THE THEORY ARGUE THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF OUR COUNTRY'S FOUNDERS REQUIRES PRESIDENTIAL CONTROL, INCLUDING A POWER TO REMOVE FEDERAL OFFICIALS FROM THEIR POSTS FOR POLITICAL REASONS. OPPONENTS OF THE THEORY RELY ON FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND OUR PRACTICE OF DISPERSING POWER MORE WIDELY. BUT NEITHER SIDE EXAMINES DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD TO SEE WHAT LIGHT OTHER COUNTRIES' EXPERIENCE MIGHT SHED ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD CRAFT A NEW RULE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW CEMENTING PRESIDENTIAL CONTROL OVER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THAT EXPERIENCE, PRIMARILY THROUGH CASE STUDIES OF RECENT DEMOCRATIC DECLINE IN HUNGARY, POLAND, AND TURKEY. IT SHOWS THAT CENTRALIZATION OF HEAD-OF-STATE CONTROL OVER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO AUTOCRACY. INDEED, UNILATERAL PRESIDENTIAL CONTROL OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CONSTITUTES A DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF AUTOCRACY. IN ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES, AUTHORITARIAN LEADERS SECURED LEGISLATION OR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS ESTABLISHING EFFECTIVE HEAD-OF-STATE CONTROL OVER KEY BUREAUCRACIES THAT USUALLY ENJOY SUBSTANTIAL INDEPENDENCE IN A WELL-FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY, SUCH AS THE PROSECUTION SERVICE, THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION, AND THE MEDIA AUTHORITY. AUTOCRATS USE THIS POWER TO SHIELD THEIR SUPPORTERS FROM PROSECUTION WHILE PERSECUTING POLITICAL OPPONENTS, TO TILT THE ELECTORAL PLAYING FIELD IN FAVOR OF THE RULING PARTY, AND TO SHRINK THE PUBLIC SPACE FOR DEBATE; THUS, SEVERELY IMPAIRING DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. REALIZATION THAT THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE PAVES THE WAY FOR AUTOCRACY REFRAMES THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE DEBATE. WE MUST ASK WHETHER THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD ESTABLISH A PRACTICE BY JUDICIAL FIAT THAT AUTHORITARIANS ESTABLISHED THROUGH LEGISLATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT OUR TRADITION FAVORS A CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF LOSING OUR DEMOCRACY AND URGES REJECTION OF THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY.
135	RECENT YEARS HAVE WITNESSED A FIERCE DEBATE ABOUT THE 'LIBERAL PEACE': A SPECIFIC VISION OF PEACE THAT HAS COME TO BE LEADING AND THAT PROMOTES DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, FREE MARKETS AND THE RULE OF LAW AS THE SOLUTION FOR WAR-TORN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. CRITICS HAVE CALLED FOR MODERATED AND ALTERNATIVE POLICY MODELS FOR WHAT IS SEEN AS AN IMPOSED AGENDA, BASED ON WESTERN VALUES AND INTERESTS. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THIS CRITICISM OF THE LIBERAL PEACE IS IN FACT CRITICISM OF INTERVENTIONIST, TOP-DOWN APPROACHES. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE LIBERAL PEACE IS DISSEMINATED IS CRITICIZED, BUT NOT, USUALLY, THE BASIC IDEAS ON WHICH IT IS BASED. THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SOME OF THE BASIC NEOLIBERAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN CONTEMPORARY PEACEBUILDING APPROACHES, INCLUDING THE LACK OF ATTENTION FOR (COLLECTIVE) IDENTITY, THE PROMOTION OF THE FREE MARKET, AND THE EMPHASIS ON NATIONAL-LEVEL, FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, DO NOT SIT WELL WITH THE REALITIES IN MANY POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES. STILL, DESPITE ALL THE CRITICISMS OF THE LIBERAL PEACE, THERE IS A DEARTH OF ALTERNATIVE VISIONS. ORIENTALIST WAYS OF THINKING AND THE HEGEMONY OF THE NEOLIBERAL DISCOURSE MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE BEYOND THE LIBERAL PEACE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVES MAY EASILY MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS THE LIBERAL PEACE DOES, NAMELY TO ASSUME THAT THE SAME SOLUTIONS APPLY EVERYWHERE. INSTEAD OF ONE ALTERNATIVE UTOPIA, WE NEED TO OPEN UP SPACE FOR HETEROTOPIAS: DISTURBING, BUT REAL PLACES THAT DEMONSTRATE THE FRICTIONS OF AND THE GRAINS OF MULTIPLE ALTERNATIVES TO NEOLIBERALIST PEACEBUILDING. FOLLOWING FOUCAULT, WE CALL FOR A WORLD WITH MANY 'HETEROTOPIAS' THAT SHOW THE 'FRICTION' BETWEEN THE LIBERAL PEACE AND ALTERNATIVE REALITIES, PRODUCING NOT ONE BUT MULTIPLE VISIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SPACE FOR HETEROTOPIAS WILL WIDEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AS THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND OTHER RELATED DEVELOPMENTS COMBINE TO CREATE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE LIBERAL PEACE.

136	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE OF MERCHANTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE EDUCATION IN THE RUSSIAN PROVINCE DURING THE SECOND THIRD OF THE 19TH CENTURY (BASED ON THE MATERIALS OF VOLOGDA PROVINCE). WOMEN'S EDUCATION STARTED BEING DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE COMMON SCHOOL SYSTEM IN 1800-1820. IT BECAME POSSIBLE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SUCH EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTS AS "STATUTE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SUBORDINATED TO UNIVERSITIES" AND "STATUTE OF GYMNASIUMS AND SCHOOLS OF DISTRICT AND PARISH" THAT WERE RELEASED IN 1804 AND 1828 RESPECTIVELY. IN 1830-1850 WOMEN'S PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS STARTED APPEARING IN VOLOGDA PROVINCE THANKS TO THE BIG SUPPORT OF LOCAL MERCHANTS. THE EXAMPLES OF SUCH SCHOOLS WERE KADNIKOVSKOE (1838), GRYAZOVETSKOE (1840), YARENSKOE (1843), VELIKO-USTYUGSKOE (1844). ANOTHER IMPORTANT EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENT DEVOTED TO FEMALE EDUCATION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 1858. IT WAS "REGULATIONS ON WOMEN'S SCHOOLS" THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IN VOLOGDA, TOTMA, USTSYSOLSK AND YARENSK. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED THANKS TO THE HUGE SUPPORT OF LOCAL MERCHANTS, WHO BECAME THE INITIATORS OF THE OPENING OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS IN TOTMA AND UST-SYSOLSK. AT THE SAME TIME THE MERCHANTS' WIVES BECAME THE TRUSTEES OF SUCH SCHOOLS (HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL CASE IN UST-SYSOLSK WHERE THE MERCHANT OF THE 1ST GUILD LATKIN V.N. GOT TO BE THE TRUSTEE ACCORDING TO THE PARTICULAR RULE OF LAW). AMONG THE SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF WOMEN'S SCHOOLS SUPPORT WERE MEANS OF LOCAL MERCHANTS WHO BOUGHT A LOT OF BOOKS, SCHOOLS SUPPLIES AND FURNITURE. BESIDES, THEY WERE REALLY INVOLVED INTO THE CHARITY AND DONATED MONEY DURING SUCH HOLIDAYS AS EASTER AND CHRISTMAS. THE BUILDINGS - WHERE THE WOMEN'S SCHOOLS WERE SITUATED - ALSO WERE TAKEN CARE OF BY MERCHANTS. FOR INSTANCE, IN 1858-1859 IN UST-SYSOLSK THE MERCHANT ZABOEV I.N. BUILT A WOODEN BUILDING FOR THE WOMEN'S SCHOOL USING HIS OWN MONEY. THUS, THE LOCAL MERCHANTS GAVE WIDE AND COMPLEX SUPPORT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE EDUCATION IN VOLOGDA PROVINCE.
137	PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF PRIVATE (PRST) AND PUBLIC (PUST) SECTOR-LED FINANCIAL SECTOR TRANSPARENCIES ON BANK INTEREST MARGINS (BIM) TERMED AS SOCIAL COST OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SETUPS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY USES A TWO-STEP DYNAMIC GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS PANEL DATA AND BOOTSTRAPPED QUANTILE MODELS WITH 91 ECONOMIES BETWEEN 2004 AND 2016. DATA IS SOURCED FROM WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATOR AND GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE DATABASES. FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOW THAT UNDER STRONG AND WEAK POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL SETUPS, THE REDUCING EFFECT OF PRST ON BIM ARE OBSERVED AND REPORTED WHILE THE FULL SAMPLE REPORTS NO SIGNIFICANT NEXUS BETWEEN PRST AND PUST ON BIM. FURTHERMORE, UNDER POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SAMPLE, ECONOMIES WITH STRONG CORRUPTION CONTROL AND REGULATORY QUALITY ARE ABLE TO REINFORCE THE DAMPENING EFFECT OF PRST ON BIM WHILE UNDER THE SAME POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SAMPLE, ECONOMIES WITH WEAK RULE OF LAW ARE ABLE TO HEIGHTEN THE REDUCING EFFECT OF PRST ON BIM. MOREOVER, UNDER FINANCIAL REGULATOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SAMPLE, ECONOMIES WITH STRONG OVERALL WEIGHTED AND UNWEIGHTED, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND POLICY DEPENDENT CENTRAL BANKS ARE ABLE TO INTENSIFY THE DIMINISHING EFFECT OF PRST ON BIM WHILE UNDER THE SAME FINANCIAL REGULATOR INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY SAMPLE, ECONOMIES WITH WEAK LIMITS ON LENDING ARE ABLE TO AMPLIFY THE REDUCING EFFECT OF PRST ON BIM. HOWEVER, PUST IS REPORTED TO PROPEL LOWER LEVELS BIM IN THE BOOTSTRAP MODELS, ESPECIALLY IN STRONG INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT POLICYMAKERS MAY RELY ON PRST TO REDUCE BIM, ESPECIALLY UNDER FINANCIAL REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, ECONOMIES MUST BE CAREFUL ON THEIR RELIANCE ON PRST BECAUSE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRST TO TAME HIGH BIM IS DEPENDENT ON THE STRENGTH OF POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL REGULATORY INSTITUTIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY PRESENTS FIRST TIME INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR-LED FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY ON BIM IN STRONG AND WEAK POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL REGULATORY INSTITUTION ECONOMIES.
138	AGENCIES SOMETIMES GIVE AWAY THEIR LEGISLATIVELY DELEGATED DECISION MAKING POWER OF THEIR OWN ACCORD. MORE SPECIFICALLY, AGENCIES MAKE AGREEMENTS IN ORDER TO TRANSFER THEIR ENTIRE JURISDICTION TO ADJUDICATE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS TO OTHER AGENCIES. THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO EXPLORE THESE MOSTLY INFORMAL, ENDOGENOUS INTERAGENCY ARRANGEMENTS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS DYNAMIC INVOLVES THE AUTHORITY TO ADJUDICATE THE LEGALITY OF PHARMACEUTICAL IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, INITIALLY DELEGATED BY CONGRESS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY. TREASURY HAS SINCE TRANSFERRED THIS AUTHORITY TO THE U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL VIA INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT, WHICH THEN RETRANSFERRED THIS AUTHORITY TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) BY MEANS OF ANOTHER INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT. THE FDA DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS. HOWEVER, TRANSFERRING THIS SET OF ADJUDICATIONS TO THE FDA ALLOWS IT TO BRING ITS SUPERIOR TECHNOCRATIC EXPERTISE TO BEAR, WHICH MAY LEAD TO HIGHER QUALITY DECISION MAKING. ON THE ONE HAND, THESE ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE HARBINGERS OF A FUTURE IN WHICH AGENCIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SHIRK, DETERIORATE RULE OF LAW VALUES, AND USURP THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH'S POWER TO DEFINE AGENCY JURISDICTION AND MAKE THE LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, INTERAGENCY TRANSFERS OF ADJUDICATION AUTHORITY REPRESENT AGENCIES' POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING BY SHARING OR EVEN TRANSFERRING POWER BASED ON THEIR ON-THE-GROUND KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OWN VARYING CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE REGIME OF ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THAT THERE IS A WAY TO ENSURE THESE INTERAGENCY TRANSFERS OF POWER AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE BOTH BENEFICIAL TO THE QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING AND ALSO CONSTITUTIONAL IN PARTICULAR, BY ALLOWING THOSE AGREEMENTS THAT BENEFIT THE QUALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING TO BE DEEMED LEGITIMATE IF GROUNDED IN STATUTORY LANGUAGE AUTHORIZING INTERAGENCY COORDINATION. FINALLY, IT PROPOSES THAT COURTS PLAY A PRIMARY ROLE IN SHAPING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-QUALITY INTERAGENCY TRANSFERS OF ADJUDICATION AUTHORITY AND ENSURING THAT THEY REMAIN WITHIN PERMISSIBLE CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDS.
139	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CINEMATIC TREATMENT OF A CLUSTER OF THEMES - LAW, JUSTICE, MORALITY, HUMAN EMOTIONS AND SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS - IN WHAT APPEARS IN GENRE TO BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS FILM, WU XIA (2011). THE FILM IS ATYPICAL FOR ITS GENRE, HOWEVER, BOTH IN THE CHARACTERS IT DEPICTS AND IN THE NARRATIVE IT CONSTRUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WU XIA HAS ONLY THREE FIGHT SCENES AND IS HEAVY WITH DIALOGUE (BOTH IN THE BROAD, CONVERSATIONAL SENSE OF SPOKEN DIALOGUE AND IN THE MORE TECHNICAL, BAKHTINIAN SENSE OF DIALOGISM (1992)). IN A STRIKING DEPARTURE FROM GENRE CONVENTIONS, THE FILM DEVELOPS WHAT AMOUNTS TO A CINEMATIC COMMENTARY ON JURISPRUDENTIAL DEBATES ABOUT FREE WILL, PUNISHMENT AND WAYS OF ATTRIBUTING RESPONSIBILITY AND BLAME FOR HUMAN BEHAVIOUR (FOR LEGAL DISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES, SEE RAWLS 1999). TAKING BORDWELL (1989)' S APPROACH TO INTERPRETING FILMIC MEANING AS EXEMPLARY IN ITS ATTENTION SIMULTANEOUSLY TO CONVENTIONAL FORM, DISTINCTIVE RHETORICAL STYLES, AND HISTORICITY, I WILL OFFER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED THE `CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE OF JUSTICE', A READING OF WU XIA THAT IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED WITH INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE FILM'S FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS, ITS STATED AND IMPLIED MEANINGS, AND ITS LIKELY IMPACT ON SPECIFIC CINEMA AUDIENCES. FOCUSING ON THE FILM'S DISTRIBUTION SIMULTANEOUSLY IN TWO DIFFERENT CHINESE LANGUAGE VERSIONS, ONE RELEASED IN HONG KONG AND THE OTHER THROUGHOUT MAINLAND CHINA, THE ANALYSIS COMPARES SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE CHOICES MADE IN THE FILM'S SOUNDTRACK AND RELATES THEM TO THE RESPECTIVE SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXTS OF FILM'S DISTRIBUTION IN ITS TWO DIFFERENT CUTS. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT WU XIA IS HIGHLY DISTINCTIVE IN SEVERAL WAYS: IN HOW IT DEPICTS THE PRACTICE OF LAW AS BEING STARKLY AT ODDS WITH THE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF BEING HUMAN; IN HOW LITTLE FAITH IT EXPRESSES IN THE RULE OF LAW; AND, PERHAPS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, IN ITS OPEN RIDICULING OF A FORMALISTIC APPROACH TO JUSTICE. I WILL CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE ASPECTS OF THE FILM IN THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS OF CHINA AND POSTCOLONIAL HONG KONG.
140	WITH THE CONVERGENCE OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIES OF SOME COUNTRIES AND THE INTENSIFICATION OF GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES, INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION BETWEEN STATES IS GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY. THEREFORE, FOR UKRAINE, IN TODAY'S CONDITIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIND FACTORS TO INCREASE NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. IN MOST CASES, COMPETITIVENESS IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE ABILITY OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY TO OCCUPY A LEADING POSITION IN THE WORLD MARKET, WHICH ENSURES THE GROWTH OF LIVING STANDARDS ON THE BASIS OF AN INNOVATIVE ECONOMY. THE INTERNATIONAL GENERAL INDICATORS OF COMPETITIVENESS OF NATIONAL ECONOMIES ARE THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX FROM THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM AND THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS RATING ACCORDING TO THE INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT. BOTH OF THESE STUDIES OVER THE PAST DECADE DEMONSTRATE UKRAINE'S LOW POSITION IN INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS RANKINGS AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES. WEAK POSITIONS OF THE LEVEL OF COMPETITIVENESS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT METHODS HIGHLIGHT THE SAME PROBLEMS IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE: INEFFICIENT FUNCTIONING OF STATE INSTITUTIONS (SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF CORRUPTION, LACK OF RULE OF LAW, AND INSECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS); LOW EFFICIENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS (UNRELIABILITY OF BANKS AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF STOCK EXCHANGES); MACROECONOMIC INSTABILITY (LOW CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTRY AND HIGH INFLATION); EXACERBATION OF HEALTH PROBLEMS (LOW PER CAPITA INCOME AND UNDERDEVELOPED HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE SHORTEN HEALTHY LIFE EXPECTANCY AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE). THUS, THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM CLASSIFIED UKRAINE AS A COUNTRY IN TRANSITION FROM A FACTOR-ORIENTED ECONOMY TO AN EFFICIENCY-ORIENTED ECONOMY. FOR COUNTRIES AT THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM, TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS, PROPOSES TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND STABILIZE THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AND FURTHER IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND TRAINING. THEREFORE, THE DIRECTIONS OF STATE POLICY IN THE FIELD OF INCREASING UKRAINE'S COMPETITIVENESS SHOULD BE: REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CORRUPTION, STRENGTHENING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET, ENSURING MACROECONOMIC STABILIZATION, STRENGTHENING THE COUNTRY'S LABOR POTENTIAL.
141	THE CALL FOR EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF LEGISLATION BY THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS SOLIDLY BASED ON GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. IN GERMANY, BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE OBLIGATION OF EVIDENTIARY EVALUATION OF LEGISLATIVE FACTS AND THEIR INCLUSION INTO JUDICIAL REVIEW ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVIDENCE-BASED LEGISLATION AND THE EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF LEGISLATION. THEREFORE, THE BEGINNINGS OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW IN THE CASE LAW OF THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DATE BACK TO THE FORMATIVE ERA OF THE COURT WHEN THE CONCEPT OF EVIDENCE-BASED LEGISLATION WAS STILL NON-EXISTENT OR REMAINED IN A DORMANT STATE. THE UPSWING OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW IN GERMANY PROFITS FROM THE ABSENCE OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY IN GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON THE ONE HAND AND A VERY STRONG READING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ON THE OTHER HAND. HENCE, EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW HAS ITS LEGAL BASIS PRIMARILY IN THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION, WHICH APPROACH THE CONCEPT OF RATIONAL LAWMAKING. HOWEVER, AS A RULE, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT CAN CONFINE ITSELF TO META-EVALUATION OF LEGISLATIVE FACTS. OWING TO THE BALANCE OF POWERS, THE COURT MUST RESPECT A LEGISLATIVE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION. THE COURT IS ONLY IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES OBLIGED TO CONDUCT A COMPLETE FACTUAL EXAMINATION. SINCE THE TAKING OF EVIDENCE BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS ONLY VAGUELY REGULATED, IT ENJOYS CONSIDERABLE LEEWAY. ALTHOUGH THE KARLSRUHE COURT(1) HAS GAINED INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION AS A FRONTRUNNER OF EMPIRICAL REVIEW, ON CLOSER INSPECTIONS MANY PROBLEMS REMAIN TO BE SOLVED. IN THIS RESPECT, THE ARTICLE CONCENTRATES ON CRITERIA DETERMINING THE GRADATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW, RANGING FROM MANIFEST ERROR TO STRICT SCRUTINY, AND ON THE INTRICATE PROBLEM OF LEGISLATIVE PROGNOSIS. AN UNBIASED ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW MUST CONSIDER IN ADDITION THE STRATEGIES OF COURTS AND INVESTIGATE, IN PARTICULAR, WHETHER AND WHEN THEY ARE NEUTRAL, PARTISAN OR PURSUE THEIR OWN INTERESTS.
142	PURPOSE - THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF CORRUPTION AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SOME SELECTED TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES FOR THE PERIOD OF 1990-2004 AND MAKE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMBATING IT. SPECIFICALLY, THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO: ASSESS WHETHER CORRUPTION HAS ANY IMPACT ON THE GROWTH OF THE SAMPLE COUNTRIES; EXAMINE WHETHER SIMULTANEOUS POLICY REFORM FOCUSSING ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW IMPACT POSITIVELY ON GROWTH OF THESE ECONOMIES; AND INVESTIGATE WHETHER CORRUPTION IN THESE COUNTRIES EXHIBIT THE EFFICIENT GREASE SYNDROME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE INDICES FOR CORRUPTION AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES WERE DRAWN FROM INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY RISK GUIDE (ICRG - PRS) FOR THE PERIOD OF 1990-2004, THE POLITY DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM THE POLITY IV, WHILE THE REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) PER CAPITA GROWTH WERE OBTAINED FROM THE PENN WORLD 6.2. THE STUDY COVERED THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1990 AND 2004 THAT COINCIDES WITH THE REAL TRANSITION OF THESE ECONOMIES FROM CENTRALLY PLANNED TO MARKET ECONOMIES. IT ADOPTS THE PANEL DATA FRAMEWORK, THE FIXED EFFECT, THE RANDOM EFFECT AND THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE ANALYSIS. FINDINGS - THE STUDY'S FINDINGS SUPPORT MAURO'S HYPOTHESIS THAT CORRUPTION HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIES. HOWEVER, THE STUDY CANNOT FIND A ROBUST STATISTICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE EFFICIENT GREASE HYPOTHESIS OF LEFF AND HUNTINGTON. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER RECOMMENDS POLICY EFFORTS THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN ACCOUNTABILITY AND BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, REDUCE DISCRETIONARY POWER, ETHNIC FRACTIONALISATION AND MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICS WITH A VIEW TO ENHANCING SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PRACTICES AT BOTH MICRO AND MACRO LEVELS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - UNLIKE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT FOCUSSED ON SINGLE CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSION WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF IDENTICAL AGGREGATE PRODUCTION FUNCTION FOR ALL COUNTRIES, THIS STUDY ADOPTS THE PANEL DATA FRAMEWORK THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM OF UNOBSERVABLE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY EFFECTS. THE PAPER EMPLOYS THE FIXED EFFECT, THE RANDOM EFFECT AND THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES.
143	DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES GREECE HAS EMERGED AS A KEY REGIONAL PLAYER AND ONE OF THE LARGEST INVESTORS IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN AND SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (CESEE) [BASTIAN, J. (2004). KNOWING YOUR WAY IN THE BALKANS: GREEK FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE. SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN AND BLACK SEA STUDIES, 4(3), 458-90; DEMOS, A., FILIPPAIOS, F., & PAPANASTASSIOU, M. (2004). AN EVENT STUDY ANALYSIS OF OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT: THE CASE OF GREECE. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF BUSINESS, 11(3), 329-48; KEKIC, L. (2005). FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN THE BALKANS: RECENT TRENDS AND PROSPECTS. SOUTHEAST EUROPEAN AND BLACK SEA STUDIES, 5(2), 171-90]. WITH THE OPENING UP OF NEIGHBOURING MARKETS IN THE EARLY 1990S THE GREEK FIRMS AND ENTREPRENEURS GRABBED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLOIT THEIR OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES AND EXPAND ABROAD. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE IMPACT OF OWNERSHIP AND LOCATION ADVANTAGES IN DETERMINING THE INTERNALISATION DECISIONS BY GREEK INVESTORS PARTICIPATING IN THE ATHENS STOCK EXCHANGE (ASE), PROVING THAT DUNNING'S ECLECTIC PARADIGM (OLI) IS A HOLISTIC, YET CONTEXT SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK OF ANALYSING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) DETERMINANTS. TO SET THE OLI IN A SPECIFIC CONTEXT, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENT SECTORS AND COUNTRIES WHERE GREEK COMPANIES HAVE INTERNATIONALISED, AS WELL AS FOR THE TIME PERIOD WHEN INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. THIS PAPER'S SECOND MAJOR CONTRIBUTION IS THAT BY LOOKING AT BOTH OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGES AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS IT COMPLEMENTS THE PREVIOUS WORKS ON INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF FDI. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE EXPANSION OF GREEK FIRMS OCCURS PRIMARILY IN SIMILAR COUNTRIES WITH SMALL MARKET SIZE, AND OPEN ECONOMIES. RULE OF LAW AND HIGH BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY REMAIN ESSENTIAL FOR THE FIRM'S DECISION WHEREAS THE EXISTENCE OF HIGH CORRUPTION ACT AS A DETERRENT. FINALLY, A SIGNIFICANT FINDING IS THAT OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LEARNING CURVE IN THE GREEK FIRMS' INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
144	ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND ITS IMPACT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAVE SPARKED THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL POLICYMAKERS, SPECIALISTS, AND ACADEMIA. THIS PAPER AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THE EMPIRICAL NEXUS BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, MEASURED BY CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, AND EDUCATION LEVELS TOGETHER WITH INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN A SOCIETY. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE REGRESSION MODEL INCLUDES THE MAIN VARIABLES THAT REFLECT THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE (GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND RULE OF LAW), TOGETHER WITH EDUCATION DIMENSION, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, RENEWABLE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND INDUSTRY. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FOR THE 1995-2020 PERIOD, FOR A SET OF 43 COUNTRIES, CONSISTING OF ALL EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MEMBERS AND THE GROUP OF TWENTY (G20) STATES. THE RESEARCH USES THREE ESTIMATIONS METHODS, RESPECTIVELY POOLED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (POOLED OLS), FIXED EFFECTS MODEL (FEM) AND RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL (REM), TOGETHER WITH A TWO-STEP DYNAMIC GMM MODEL, TO ADDRESS THE ENDOGENEITY ISSUE AS WELL. THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES REFLECTING INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY FROM A TECHNICAL POINT OF VIEW, INCLUDED IN THE MODEL WHEN CONSIDERING THE PCSE ESTIMATION, HAVE A DIRECT AND POSITIVE LINK TO CO2 EMISSIONS' LEVEL, WITH CONTROL OF CORRUPTION VARIABLE BEING THE ONLY ONE TO INFLUENCE IN A POSITIVE MANNER CO2 EMISSIONS AT A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL. EDUCATION LEVEL, TOGETHER WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH, FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INDUSTRY, HAD A NEGATIVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AS WELL UPON ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, AN INCREASE OF ONE UNIT IN THESE VARIABLES CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE EU AND G20 SAMPLE WHEN CONSIDERING BOTH THE PANEL CORRECTED MODEL AS WELL AS THE GMM SCENARIO. RENEWABLE ENERGY IS THE ONLY INDEPENDENT VARIABLE TO MANIFEST A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE AND DIRECT LINK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE NEED OF ADAPTING THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF ENERGY, IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS' SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. ALSO, THERE IS A NEED TO IMPROVE CITIZENS' PERCEPTIONS OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND INSTITUTIONS BY BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO FORMULATE AND IMPLEMENT REGULATIONS.
145	A BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE PRESENT PATENT REGIME INTERNATIONALLY, REVEALS THAT STATES HAVE AN UNTRAMMELLED, UNBRIDLED PRIVILEGE TO DEROGATE FROM ANY BURDEN AS MAY ARISE ON INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS HELD BY ITS CITIZENS, IN THE NAME OF 'SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY'. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO A POWER CONFERRED UPON THE STATE TO ACQUIRE PATENTS ARBITRARILY AND THE DISCRETION TO GRANT COMPULSORY LICENSES TO THIRD PARTIES. IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THIS HAS AROUSED MUCH DEBATE EVER SINCE THE JUDICIARY MAINTAINED A STAND IN FAVOUR OF THE DOCTRINE OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY WHICH HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE BRITISH COMMON LAW CONCEPT OF 'THE KING CAN DO NO WRONG'; A PRINCIPLE THAT IS REGARDED ANACHRONISTIC BY MANY. EVEN IN INDIA, THE INDIAN PATENT ACT, 1970 HAS PROVISIONS WHICH IMMUNIZE THE STATE FROM LIABILITY IN CASES OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND PROVIDE FOR ARBITRARY ACQUISITION OF PATENTS; FOR REASONS THAT NEED NOT NECESSARILY FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT OF MEDICAL EMERGENCIES OR ONLY FOR LIFE-SAVING MEDICINES OR TECHNOLOGIES, AS MANY WOULD WRONGLY TEND TO BELIEVE, BUT FOR ANY USE BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNDER THE ACT, THE GOVERNMENT CAN INFRINGE OR ACQUIRE A PATENT DIRECTLY AND OPENLY WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY. IN THE LIGHT OF THIS, CAN ARTICLE 300A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION (THE RIGHT TO PROPERTY), INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DOCTRINE OF REASONABLENESS, BE USED AS A REMEDY BY PATENTEES IN CASE OF INFRINGEMENT BY THE STATE THROUGH A WRIT PETITION UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF THE CONSTITUTION? AFTER ALL, THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE LIABILITY OF THE STATE IN INDIA IS INDEED MUCH MORE EVOLVED AND MORE ORIENTED IN FAVOUR OF THE RULE OF LAW THAN IT IS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES AND DENOUNCES THE SHEER INCONGRUITY BETWEEN PATENT INFRINGEMENT LIABILITY FOR ACTS BY A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL AND EXEMPTION FOR THE SAME ACTS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND SUGGESTS SOME REFORMS IN THE PRESENT INDIAN PATENT LAW.
146	STARTING IN 1957 WITH SIX COUNTRIES, THE EU OF 27 HAS BECOME TODAY THE LARGEST ECONOMIC INTEGRATION BLOC IN THE WORLD. THE NEW CANDIDATE MEMBER STATES ARE CROATIA, FYROM, AND TURKEY, FOLLOWED BY THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, KOSOVO, MONTENEGRO, SERBIA. ALBANIA APPLIED FOR MEMBERSHIP ON 28 APRIL 2009. GEOGRAPHICAL AND CULTURAL LIMITATIONS EVENTUALLY WILL DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM ABSOLUTE SIZE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE OPTIMUM SIZE HOWEVER COULD BE LOWER THAN THE ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES. ACADEMIC RESEARCH ABOUT OPTIMUM SIZE IS BASED ON THEORIES ABOUT CLUB SIZE, ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND CONVERGENCE. FREQUENTLY POLITICAL DECISIONS IN FAVOR FOR ENLARGEMENT OVERRULE THE ECONOMIC RATIONALE FOR THE OPTIMUM SIZE OF THE EU. SINCE 1993 THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA DETERMINE THE PRECONDITIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP. BESIDES THE ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERSHIP -THE SO CALLED "ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE" - AND THE ECONOMIC CRITERIA, THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OFTEN GOES TO THE POLITICAL REQUIREMENT OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES. THE EU OFFERS HELP TO COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF MEETING THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA. FOR THE CANDIDATE MEMBER COUNTRIES THE INSTRUMENT FOR PRE-ACCESSION ASSISTANCE (IPA) IS AVAILABLE, AND THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND PARTNERSHIP INSTRUMENT (ENPI) FOR THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SIZE OF THE EU AND THE CAPACITY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE ACTUAL ECONOMIC CRISIS. DEFICIT SPENDING BY THE EU IS NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE BUDGET. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (ECB) HAS BEEN APPLYING AN EXPANSIONARY MONETARY POLICY BY FREQUENT INTEREST RATE CUTS, BUT THE IMPACT ONLY APPLIES TO THE 16 EURO COUNTRIES. THE EU COMMISSION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATING A TOLERANT ATTITUDE AGAINST VARIOUS TYPES OF STATE SUPPORT WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN BY MEMBER STATES TO SECTORS IN TROUBLE. AN OVERALL RECOVERY ACTION PLAN AS IN THE US IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE EU, AS THERE IS NO MANDATE FOR SUCH AN ACTION PLAN AND BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDING.
147	THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN RECENT YEARS HAS EMBRACED AN ANTI-MAJORITARIAN TREND TOWARD PROVIDING CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR THE ELITE WHO OWN OR CONTROL CORPORATIONS. THIS TREND IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING AS IT THREATENS TO UNDERMINE THE BALANCE FOUND IN STATE CORPORATE LAW BETWEEN PRIVATE ORDERING FOR INTERNAL CORPORATE MATTERS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION TO POLICE THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF THE CORPORATE FORM. THE COURT'S INTERVENTIONS ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LEAVE VULNERABLE GROUPS WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUSLY-NEUTRAL LAWS DESIGNED TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION, PROTECT WORKERS, OR PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH CARE. WHILE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS NOT YET EXPLICITLY PREEMPTED WHAT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE PROVINCE OF STATES, THE COURT HAS RELIED, BOTH IMPLICITLY AND EXPLICITLY, ON ITS OWN CONTROVERSIAL DEFINITIONS OF STATE LAW AS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO CREATE SPEECH RIGHTS FOR CORPORATIONS AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS FOR CORPORATE OWNERS. ABSENT EXPLICIT FEDERAL PREEMPTION, STATES CAN AND SHOULD FIGHT BACK AGAINST THIS CREEPING FEDERALIZATION OF STATE CORPORATE LAW. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A ROADMAP. IT SUGGESTS MODEST CHANGES TO THE VEIL PIERCING DOCTRINE THAT CAN HELP TO RESTORE, AT LEAST IN PART, THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN STATES AND THEIR CORPORATE CREATIONS. A STATE COURT SIGNALING TO BUSINESS OWNERS EVEN A POTENTIAL FOR PIERCING, AND THUS THE POTENTIAL FOR UNLIMITED PERSONAL LIABILITY, COULD DISCOURAGE CORPORATIONS DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE FROM SEEKING RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO NEUTRALLY APPLICABLE LAWS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THESE CHANGES DO NOT THREATEN TO UNDERMINE THE CORPORATE CONTROL MECHANISMS THAT HAVE ALLOWED FOR EFFICIENT PRIVATE ORDERING WITHIN CORPORATIONS, NOR WILL THEY ALLOW CORPORATIONS TO AVOID THESE THIRD-PARTY PROTECTIONS BY REINCORPORATING IN A DIFFERENT STATE. FORCING THE FEDERAL COURTS TO CONFRONT STATE ASSERTIONS OF THEIR RIGHT TO LIMIT AND DEFINE CORPORATIONS WILL, AT THE VERY LEAST, REQUIRE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT INTENDS TO FEDERALIZE STATE CORPORATE LAW, ADVANCING RULE OF LAW VALUES LIKE CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS ALIKE.
148	BACKGROUND SEX WORKERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY HIV COMPARED WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION. MOST STUDIES OF HIV RISK AMONG SEX WORKERS HAVE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL RISK FACTORS, WITH FEW STUDIES ASSESSING POTENTIAL STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HIV RISK. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXAMINE WHETHER CRIMINAL LAWS AROUND SEX WORK ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIV PREVALENCE AMONG FEMALE SEX WORKERS. METHOD WE ESTIMATE CROSS-SECTIONAL, ECOLOGICAL REGRESSION MODELS WITH DATA FROM 27 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ON HIV PREVALENCE AMONG SEX WORKERS FROM THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE CONTROL; SEX-WORK LEGISLATION FROM THE US STATE DEPARTMENT'S COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC LEGAL DOCUMENTS; THE RULE OF LAW AND GROSS-DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, ADJUSTED FOR PURCHASING POWER, FROM THE WORLD BANK; AND THE PREVALENCE OF INJECTING DRUG USE AMONG SEX WORKERS. ALTHOUGH DATA FROM TWO COUNTRIES INCLUDE MALE SEX WORKERS, THE NUMBERS ARE SO SMALL THAT THE FINDINGS HERE ESSENTIALLY PERTAIN TO PREVALENCE IN FEMALE SEX WORKERS. FINDINGS COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LEGALISED SOME ASPECTS OF SEX WORK (N=17) HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HIV PREVALENCE AMONG SEX WORKERS THAN COUNTRIES THAT CRIMINALISE ALL ASPECTS OF SEX WORK ( N=10; BETA=-2 .09,95% CI -0 .80 TO -3.37; P=0 . 003), EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ( BETA=-1 . 86; P=0.038) AND THE PROPORTION OF SEX WORKERS WHO ARE INJECTING DRUG USERS (-1.93; P=0 . 026). WE FOUND THAT THE RELATION BETWEEN SEX WORK POLICY AND HIV AMONG SEX WORKERS MIGHT BE PARTLY MODERATED BY THE EFFECTIVENESS AND FAIRNESS OF ENFORCEMENT, SUGGESTING LEGALISATION OF SOME ASPECTS OF SEX WORK COULD REDUCE HIV AMONG SEX WORKERS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT IN COUNTRIES WHERE ENFORCEMENT IS FAIR AND EFFECTIVE. INTERPRETATION OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE LEGALISATION OF SOME ASPECTS OF SEX WORK MIGHT HELP REDUCE HIV PREVALENCE IN THIS HIGH-RISK GROUP, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE JUDICIARY IS EFFECTIVE AND FAIR.
149	PURPOSE-THE INTRODUCTION IN ITALY IN JULY 2021 OF THE "COVID-19 GREEN CERTIFICATION ", KNOWN AS THE "GREEN PASS ", WAS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. WHILE ITS USE FOR HEALTH REASONS IS DEBATABLE BOTH LOGICALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY, ITS EFFECTS SHOULD BE MEASURED AT THE GENERAL SOCIOLOGICAL LEVEL. THE "GREEN PASS " ALLOWED ITALIAN SOCIAL LIFE TO BE SHAPED ACCORDING TO A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROFILE THAT CAN BE TRACED BACK TO A "SOCIETY OF CONTROL ". THIS PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUE.DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH-THIS PAPER, OF A THEORETICAL NATURE, INTENDS TO VERIFY SUCH AN INTERPRETATION THROUGH A CRITICAL SURVEY OF GILLES DELEUZE'S WELL-KNOWN POST-SCRIPTUM SUR LES SOCIETES DE CONTROLE (1990) AND RELATING THE THEORIES TO IT FROM CYBERNETIC SCIENCE, SOCIOLOGY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND THE CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY, SPECIFICALLY MICHEL FOUCAULT. AFTER A SHORT INTRODUCTION ON THE HISTORY OF THE INSTRUMENT'S INTRODUCTION, THE PAPER, DIVIDED INTO PARTS REFLECTING THE SET-UP OF DELEUZE'S TEXT, EXAMINES THE SYSTEMIC SOCIAL EFFECTS OF THE "GREEN PASS " WITH REGARD TO ITS LOGIC, AND CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON THE PROGRAM OF THE INSTRUMENT'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.FINDINGS-THE "GREEN PASS " PUT INTO PRACTICE A MODEL OF A SOCIETY OF CONTROL AS ANTICIPATED BY DELEUZE, VERIFIED WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO SOME INSTANCES OF LUHMANN'S THEORY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS, AND IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF A FOUCAULT'S "NORMALIZING SOCIETY " IN THE PROCESS OF DEFINITION AND AFFIRMATION.SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS- THE "GREEN PASS " HAS BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL TOOL THAT HAS CAUSED FORMS OF SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION AND EXCLUSION AND HAS SERIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE CONCEPTUAL PAPER TRIES TO REFLECT ON THE PREMISES AND IMPLICATIONS OF THIS INSTRUMENT.ORIGINALITY/VALUE- THE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM BOTH IN A CRITICAL KEY AND ACCORDING TO CONCEPTS AND THEORIES OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF SOCIAL SYSTEMS, CYBERNETICS AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY.
150	THERE ARE DISPUTES ON THE LEGAL ACCEPTANCE OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS AND THE RISK OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIM SPOILING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS SKYROCKETING. HOW TO MANAGE THE RISK OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IS THE SUBJECT OF URGENT RESEARCH, ESPECIALLY COVID-19 IS RAVAGING THE WORLD AND THE RISK OF ECONOMIC CRISIS IS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. IN THIS STUDY, WE COLLECTED 1784 CASES OF FOOD OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS FROM THE CHINESE LEGAL DOCUMENTS WEBSITE. USING EXCEL, REVIEW MANAGER 5.0 AND SPSS 19.0, THE NUMBER OF CASES PROSECUTED AS "CONSUMERS" WERE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF TEXTUAL ANALYSIS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WAS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS, WITH 2017 AS A GREAT VALUE POINT (WATERSHED); THE RATE OF LOSING OCCUPATIONAL CLAIM CASES HAS BEEN CLIMBING SINCE 2018; AND THE RISK OF LOSING OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF TRUE MEANINGFUL CONSUMER ADVOCACY CASES (Z = 6.99, P < 0.001), AND IN 2019, THE RISK OF LOSING A CASE WAS 33.34 TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF AN ORDINARY CONSUMER. THE PROPORTION OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FOOD SAFETY DISPUTES IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH OFFICIAL PROTECTIVE BEHAVIOR; THE FAILURE RATE OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH OFFICIAL REGULATORY BEHAVIOR. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS ARE BEING REEXAMINED BY SOCIETY; THE CONTINUED RISE IN THE NUMBER OF UNSUCCESSFUL OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS CASES INDICATES A LACK OF REGULATORY GUIDANCE FOR THEIR PROFIT-MAKING BEHAVIOR, THE EXISTENCE OF MALICIOUS REPORTING COMPLAINTS AGAINST BUSINESS BEHAVIOR, DAMAGE TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND A CERTAIN LACK OF LEGALITY. THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED THAT LAWS AND REGULATIONS SHOULD BE IN LINE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, HIGHLIGHT THE LEGAL THINKING AND THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT, AND BUILD A FIVE-IN-ONE MECHANISM OF "CONSUMERS, OPERATORS, MEDIA, GOVERNMENT, AND JUSTICE" TO COORDINATE THE MANAGEMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS, CRACK DOWN ON OCCUPATIONAL CLAIMS, AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE CREATION OF A GOOD BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.
151	MUNICIPAL CHARTERS ARE THE FORGOTTEN CONSTITUTIONS, OF OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM. SCHOLARS GENERALLY UNDERSTAND OUR DEMOCRACY TO BE GOVERNED BY FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS, BUT THERE IS A THIRD, ALMOST ENTIRELY IGNORED REALM OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE THAT LIVES AT THE LOCAL-GOVERNMENT LEVEL, EMBODIED IN THE CHARTERS THAT GOVERN CITIES, COUNTIES, AND TOWNS. ENGAGING THESE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS IS CRITICAL. IN AN ERA OF POLITICAL GRIDLOCK AND NATIONAL POLARIZATION, WITH CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCREASINGLY GRAPPLING WITH POLICY CONCERNS ONCE CONSIDERED STATE, FEDERAL, OR EVEN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES, THE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT GOVERN LOCAL DEMOCRACY MERIT NEWFOUND SCRUTINY. ALTHOUGH MUNICIPAL CHARTERS SERVE MANY OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT CONSTITUTIONS PERFORM AT OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT-DELINEATING PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND ARTICULATING AREAS OF "HIGHER" LAW-LEGAL SCHOLARS RARELY TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY AS CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT FOREGROUNDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF MUNICIPAL CHARTERS PROVIDES NEW THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND THE ROLE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY IN OUR POLITICAL ORDER. LIKE THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, CHARTERS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT LOCUS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL MEANING AND CIVIC IDENTITY, RENDERING FUNDAMENTAL CHOICES ABOUT GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE, POLITICAL PROCESS, AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS MORE SALIENT AND DOCTRINALLY SIGNIFICANT. UNDERSTANDING MUNICIPAL CHARTERS AS CONSTITUTIONS, IN TURN, CARRIES IMPORTANT NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS. PROPERLY FRAMED, CHARTERS CAN REINFORCE THE CONTESTED NATURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS DEMOCRATIC POLITIES, RATHER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE ARMS OF THE STATES OR QUASI-PRIVATE SERVICE PROVIDERS, AT A TIME WHEN THE DEMOCRATIC UNDERPINNINGS OF LOCALISM ARE UNDER STRAIN. IMPROVING CHARTER CONSTITUTIONALISM CAN ALSO SERVE TO LEGITIMATE CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY FURTHERING RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY AND STABILITY. A NEWFOUND APPRECIATION OF THE CONCEPTUAL AND NORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF MUNICIPAL CHARTERS, FINALLY, SUGGESTS PATHWAYS FOR REFORMING THE LAW AND PRACTICE SURROUNDING THESE INSTRUMENTS. THIS ARTICLE THUS PROPOSES PRAGMATIC INNOVATIONS IN HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATES CAN APPROACH CHARTERS, EMPHASIZING THE CENTRALITY OF INCLUSIVE PROCESS IN RATIFYING AND AMENDING CHARTERS AT WHAT ARE, ULTIMATELY, VITAL LOCAL CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENTS.
152	THE RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY TO REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS (RDPS) WHO FLED THEIR HOMES DURING THE 1992 TO 1995 CONFLICT IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA HAS BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ON ITS OWN TERMS. AFTER GETTING OFF TO A SLOW START IN THE IMMEDIATE POST-WAR YEARS, THIS PROCESS SAW THE RETURN OF MORE THAN 200,000 CLAIMED PROPERTIES TO THEIR PRE-WAR RESIDENTS BY MID-2004. ALTHOUGH PROPERTY RESTITUTION HAS FACILITATED DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR RDPS WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM IT, THESE DURABLE SOLUTIONS HAVE NOT EXCLUSIVELY TAKEN THE FORM OF VOLUNTARY AND PERMANENT RETURN. IN MANY CASES, RDPS HAVE CHOSEN INSTEAD TO SELL, EXCHANGE, OR LEASE THEIR RESTITUTED HOMES IN ORDER TO FINANCE VOLUNTARY INTERNAL RESETTLEMENT IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OTHER THAN THEIR PRE-WAR PLACES OF RESIDENCE. IN ALL CASES, HOWEVER, PROPERTY RESTITUTION HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO THE VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF EITHER RETURN OR RESETTLEMENT, FACILITATING FREE AND INFORMED CHOICES BY RDPS REGARDING THEIR FUTURE. PROPERTY RESTITUTION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA HAS OFTEN BEEN HELD UP AS A MODEL FOR OTHER POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS CHARACTERIZED BY MASS-DISPLACEMENT. HOWEVER, THE UTILITY OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AS AN EXAMPLE MUST BE ASSESSED IN LIGHT OF FAVOURABLE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE UNLIKELY TO BE REPEATED IN OTHER CONTEXTS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THESE FACTORS SHOULD NOT DISQUALIFY BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AS AN EXAMPLE, BUT SHOULD INSTEAD UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE THAT LESSONS LEARNED IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA BE INCORPORATED EARLY IN THE PLANNING OF OTHER PEACE MISSIONS AND IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENTLY. ONE OF THE FOREMOST OF THESE LESSONS WAS THE EFFICACY OF SHIFTING THE FOCUS FROM THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED CONCEPT OF RETURN TO A MORE IMPARTIAL "RULE OF LAW" APPROACH, CONNOTING AN EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUALS' RIGHTS TO THEIR FORMER HOMES. THE UNUSUAL LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ALLOWED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CORRECT ITS OWN EARLY MISTAKES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO GUARANTEE PROPERTY RESTITUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY.
153	ALTHOUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, THE LITERATURE THAT EXAMINES THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION, AS A KEY FACTOR OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE QUALITY ON FINANCIAL INCLUSION LINK TO GROWTH IS NOT AS VAST. PROMOTING FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND DEVELOPING GOOD GOVERNANCE ARE MAIN, BUT CHALLENGING PRIORITIES IN THE MENA REGION. THE PAPER EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL INCLUSION, GOVERNANCE, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE MENA REGION. A SYSTEM GENERAL METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM) DYNAMIC PANEL MODEL TECHNIQUE IS EMPLOYED ON ANNUAL DATA FOR 44 EMERGING MARKETS (EMS) AND MENA OVER THE PERIOD 1990-2018, USING A NUMBER OF MEASURES OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION COVERING THE HOUSEHOLDS AND THE FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE. PARTICULARLY, THE STUDY USES INDICATORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF BANK ACCOUNTS (PER 1000 ADULT POPULATION), BANK ACCOUNTS FOR CORPORATES/ENTERPRISES, AND THE NUMBER OF BANK BRANCHES AND ATMS (PER 100,000 PEOPLE), PERCENTAGE OF FIRMS USING BANKS TO FINANCE INVESTMENTS, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF FIRMS USING BANK LOANS TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL INCLUSION POSITIVELY IMPACTS GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH IN THE SELECTED COUNTRIES. FINANCIAL INCLUSION MEASURED BY THE HOUSEHOLDS' FINANCIAL ACCESS INDEX HAS A POSITIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE MENA REGION, BUT REQUIRES SUPERVISORY AND REGULATORY REGIMES WITH BACKING OF THE RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THE EFFECT FIRMS' ACCESS TO FINANCE IS ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PRESENCE OF STRONG INSTITUTIONS. FINALLY, OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT COUNTRIES WITH RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS OF FINANCIAL ACCESS SERVICES, SUCH AS THE MENA REGION, WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM AN IMPROVEMENT IN GOVERNANCE. HENCE, OUR POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS DEVELOPING A NATIONAL STRATEGIC PLAN AIMED TOWARDS IMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCE COUPLED WITH POLICIES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL ACCESS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.
154	THE LAW CANNOT BE A SECRET HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC. THIS PROPOSITION STRIKES MOST OF US AS UNCONTROVERSIAL-A BASIC PREMISE OF ANY LEGAL ORDER COMMITTED TO DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. YET IN THIS COUNTRY SECRET LAW NOT ONLY EXISTS, BUT HAS BECOME AN ENTRENCHED FEATURE OF CONTEMPORARY NATIONAL SECURITY GOVERNANCE. FROM NSA SURVEILLANCE TO TERRORIST WATCH LISTS TO TARGETED KILLINGS, THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL NATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAMS OF OUR TIME HAVE ALL BEEN GOVERNED BY SECRET RULES, SECRET DIRECTIVES, AND SECRET LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THIS DEEPLY UNSETTLING STATE OF AFFAIRS. IT PUSHES BEYOND A REFLEXIVE AVERSION TO SECRET LAW TO UNPACK THE UNDERLYING NORMATIVE PRINCIPLES THAT BOTH MILITATE AGAINST SECRET LAW AND MOTIVATE ITS WIDESPREAD USE. SECRET LAW POSES GRAVE THREATS TO BASIC VALUES OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, AND SEPARATION OF POWERS, BUT IT ALSO SERVES PRAGMATIC NATIONAL SECURITY PURPOSES. BY CLARIFYING THESE COMPETING VALUES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF DISTINCT CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE A GIVEN EXAMPLE OF SECRET LAW ESPECIALLY ODIOUS-OR ESSENTIALLY BENIGN. THIS ARTICLE THUS OFFERS A SYSTEMATIC RUBRIC FOR EVALUATING PARTICULAR INSTANCES OF SECRET LAW. THIS ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LEGAL ECOSYSTEM THAT GOVERNS SECRET LAW IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH-WHAT I CALL THE "LAW OF SECRET LAW." THE PICTURE THAT EMERGES IS STARTLING: EXISTING LAW GIVES THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ENORMOUS DISCRETION TO KEEP LAW SECRET. INDEED, THE COURTS HAVE EFFECTIVELY ENDORSED THE PRACTICE OF SECRET LAW, AND CONGRESS HAS BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY QUIESCENT IN ITS FACE. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A NOVEL REFORM AGENDA TO TRANSFORM THIS PERMISSIVE LEGAL ECOSYSTEM INTO ONE THAT MORE ADEQUATELY PROTECTS TRANSPARENCY VALUES. IT OFFERS CORE PRINCIPLES FOR A NEW FRAMEWORK STATUTE LIMITING THE PRACTICE OF SECRET LAW. IN ADDITION, IT ARGUES THAT COURTS CAN AND SHOULD PROMPT DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATION OVER SECRET LAW (AND LEGISLATIVE RECONSIDERATION OF THE STATUS QUO) BY ADOPTING A CONSTITUTIONAL CLEAR STATEMENT RULE AGAINST SECRET LAW THAT IS GROUNDED IN THE TEXT AND STRUCTURE OF THE CONSTITUTION.
155	PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN STATE IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT SUCH FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, CIVIL SOCIETY, RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS. THESE IMPORTANT DOCTRINES ALSO INCLUDE THE THEORY OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM. PHENOMENON PARLIAMENTARIANISM IS CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH DEMOCRACY IS DEVELOPED LESS OR MORE. WE COULDN'T IMAGINE ANY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WITHOUT PARLIAMENT ACTIVITY IN THE STATE. AS A MATTER OF FACT PARLIAMENTARIANISM IS CONNECTED WITH SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. IT IS IMPROVED ITS DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME TIME. PERIODICALLY WHEN THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS DIFFICULT IN THE STATE OR SOCIETY, THE PROBLEM OF CREATING OR REFORMING OF REAL REPRESENTATIVE ORGAN IS BECOMING ONE OF THE KEY-MOMENT IN THE REFORMATION OF THE STATE MECHANISM. EXACTLY PARLIAMENT PERSONIFIES THE FORUM OF PUBLIC OPINION IN WHICH THE CONSENSUS CAN BE REACHES AND ALL THE PARTIES OF COMPETITIVE POLITICAL PROCESS AGREE. BECAUSE OF SUCH REPRESENTING CHARACTER THE IDEA OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM IS SUPPORTED BY PEOPLE. INSTITUTE OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM IS A KEY ELEMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL SYSTEMS: THE DEGREE OF SOCIETY DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION INTO POLITICAL PRACTICE OF THE STATE. THE INTEREST TO THE PROBLEM OF THE INSTITUTE OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM FUNCTIONING IS CAUSED BY THE PROCESS WHICH ARE HAPPENING IN THE UKRAINIAN SOCIETY. PARLIAMENTARIANISM AS A POLITICAL AND LEGAL CATEGORY IS A VERY COMPLEX, MULTIDIMENSIONAL PHENOMENON. THERE ARE MANY METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN DETERMINING PARLIAMENTARIANISM AS THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCH. THE NOTION OF "PARLIAMENTARIANISM" IS OFTEN USED IN MODERN LEGAL SCIENCE RESEARCHERS; HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMATIC ISSUES TO DETERMINATION ITS CONTENT CHARACTERISTICS. ONE OF THE CENTRAL PROBLEMS IN STUDYING OF THE INSTITUTE OF PARLIAMENTARIANISM IS THE PROBLEM OF THE CORRELATION OF REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE PUBLIC SOVEREIGNTY. IN THE ARTICLE THE AUTHOR HAVE DISCOVERED THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS OF THE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SOVEREIGNTY IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC APPROACHES TO PARLIAMENTARY ACTIVITY AND DETERMINED THE OUTLINES OF PARLIAMENTARY LAW.
156	IN THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, GOVERNING DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE IS CHALLENGING. INTELLIGENCE SITS IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW'S COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HISTORY AMPLY DEMONSTRATES THAT INTELLIGENCE INCLUDING DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE-FREQUENTLY BEGINS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW GIVES OUT. THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF GOVERNING INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN UNNECESSARILY EXACERBATED BY A DEEP-SEATED AND LONGSTANDING CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE IS. FOR OVER A CENTURY, POLICYMAKERS AND ACADEMIC COMMENTATORS HAVE ASSUMED THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY A FORM OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND THAT CRIMINAL LAW SUPPLIES THE LOGICAL STARTING PLACE FOR ITS EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE. OVER THE YEARS, THIS FAULTY PREMISE HAS FOSTERED A BOOM-AND-BUST CYCLE IN INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE; DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN, AT DIFFERENT TIMES, EFFECTIVELY OUT OF BUSINESS OR UNCHECKED BY LAW. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE AND ITS GOVERNANCE. DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE IS A KIND OF RISK ASSESSMENT, A REGULATORY ACTIVITY FAMILIAR ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. SIMILAR TO RISK ASSESSMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL OR HEALTH AND SAFETY LAW, DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE SEEKS TO QUANTIFY A RISK BEFORE IT MATERIALIZES, BASED ON THE CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF AGGREGATIVE DATA. DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE AS RISK ASSESSMENT IN TURN NECESSITATES A REGULATORY APPROACH TO INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW SOME OF THE MAINSTAYS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ESPECIALLY AN EXPANSIVE CONCEPTION OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS, JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND PLURALISM CAN AND MUST PLAY A KEY ROLE IN INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE. IT CONTENDS THAT INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE MUST CONCERN ITSELF NOT MERELY WITH PRODUCING INTELLIGENCE THAT IS OBTAINED WITHOUT ILLEGALITY OR ABUSE, BUT ALSO WITH GENERATING ACCURATE AND USEFUL INTELLIGENCE. THIS ARTICLE MAKES CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SITUATING THESE THEORETICAL CLAIMS WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONAL LANDSCAPE OF CONTEMPORARY INTELLIGENCE PRACTICE. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE IS HERE TO STAY. THE NEED FOR "DOMESTICATING" INTELLIGENCE IS THEREFORE URGENT. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF INTELLIGENCE AND ITS PROPER GOVERNANCE.
157	IN JANUARY 2005, A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT (CPA) BROUGHT ONE OF THE LONGEST CONFLICTS IN AFRICA - THE SO-CALLED SUDAN NORTH-SOUTH CONFLICT - TO AN END. THE CPA SEEKS TO RESOLVE THE ROOT CAUSES OF SUDAN'S CONFLICT BY PROVIDING A SIX-YEAR TEMPORARY SOLUTION AIMED AT LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A COUNTRY THAT IS BASED ON PLURALISTIC DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW BY GRANTING SOUTHERN SUDAN AUTONOMOUS STATUS AND FIXING A TIMETABLE ON THE QUESTION OF THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTHERN SUDAN. IT ESTABLISHES A DUAL LEGAL SYSTEM (A SHARIA SYSTEM IN THE NORTH AND A SECULAR SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH) AND A COMPREHENSIVE BILL OF RIGHTS TO BE ENSHRINED IN THE NATIONAL INTERIM CONSTITUTION (INC). THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW THE BILL OF RIGHTS ADDRESSES THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE SUDAN CONFLICT. THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD; IT IS TOO EARLY TO PRESENT AN ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION BASED ON ACTUAL PRACTICE. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO OFFER TEXTUAL ANALYSIS; THAT IS, WHAT THE LAW SAYS SHOULD HAPPEN IF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS ARE TO WORK PROPERLY; AND IT ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A BACKGROUND TO THE SUDANESE BILL OF RIGHTS. THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS REVIEWED BRIEFLY. HOW THE BILL OF RIGHTS ADDRESSES THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF THE SUDAN CONFLICT IS CONSIDERED BY LOOKING AT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHTS, ETHNIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND THE RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION OF THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH SUDAN. THE APPLICATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE WAY IT PROTECTS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IS EXAMINED BY FOCUSING ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIONS OF THE STATE. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE PROBLEMS REGARDING ITS INTERPRETATION ARE CONSIDERED. THE PAPER THEN EXAMINES THE LIMITATIONS CLAUSE OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS, AND CONCLUDES BY REFLECTING ON THE PRECEDING SECTIONS.
158	THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE LAW OF THE SEA (ITLOS) WAS ESTABLISHED AS AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL BODY BY THE UNITED NATIONS WITH THEW FOCUSED AIM OF RESOLVING DISPUTES ARISING FROM THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA. WHILE A DISPUTE IS BEING ADDRESSED, THE NUMBER ONE ROLE OF ITLOS IS TO INTERVENE WITH TIMELY REMEDIES TO PRESERVE THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES AND PREVENT IRREPARABLE DAMAGE. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORED THE APPROACH USED BY CHINA TO INTERIM MEASURES IN ITLOS PROCEEDINGS AND ITS BROADER IMPLICATIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE KEY CASES INVOLVING CHINA AND INTERIM MEASURES LEAD TO THE UNCOVERING OF VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE CHINA'S STANCE AND, THEREFORE, BY EXTENSION, AFFECT ITS IMPACT ON ITLOS PROCEEDINGS AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.CASE STUDY METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO EXAMINE SPECIFIC INSTANCES WHERE CHINA HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN ITLOS PROCEEDINGS AND THE APPLICATION OF INTERIM MEASURES. PRIMARY SOURCES, LEGAL DOCUMENTS, AND OFFICIAL STATEMENTS FROM CHINA, WERE USED TO GATHER RELEVANT DATA. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT CHINA'S GROWING INVOLVEMENT IN ITLOS CASES REFLECTED ITS EVOLVING MARITIME DISPUTES AND INTERESTS. THE COUNTRY'S APPROACH TO INTERIM MEASURES WAS INFLUENCED BY ITS STANCE ON SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL CLAIMS, WHICH IMPACTED ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE TRIBUNAL AND THE LEGITIMACY OF ITLOS DECISIONS. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT CHINA'S INCREASING ENGAGEMENT WITH ITLOS CASES REFLECTS THAT ITS MARITIME DISPUTES AND INTERESTS. CHINA'S APPROACH TO INTERIM MEASURES IS SHAPED BY ITS SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL CLAIMS, INFLUENCING ITS INTERACTIONS WITH THE TRIBUNAL AND THE LEGITIMACY OF ITLOS DECISIONS.THE STUDY'S CONTRIBUTION LAY IN ENHANCING THE UNDERSTANDING OF INTERIM MEASURES' SIGNIFICANCE IN ITLOS PROCEEDINGS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL MARITIME GOVERNANCE. BY HIGHLIGHTING LESSONS LEARNED AND OFFERING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT AND POSSIBLE REFORMS, THIS RESEARCH PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR CHINA AND OTHER STATES INVOLVED IN MARITIME DISPUTES. MOREOVER, THE STUDY OPENED AVENUES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH INTO EMERGING ISSUES IN MARITIME LAW AND GOVERNANCE, ENSURING THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF MARITIME CONFLICTS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
159	OBJECTIVE TO ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, WITH A PROXY FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE IN REPRODUCTIVE, MATERNAL, NEWBORN AND CHILD HEALTH (RMNCH). DESIGN ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS BASED ON DATA FROM NATIONAL STANDARDISED CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEYS. SETTING LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES WITH A DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY OR A MULTIPLE INDICATOR CLUSTER SURVEY SINCE 2005. PARTICIPANTS 1 246 710 MOTHERS AND 2 129 212 CHILDREN FROM 80 NATIONAL SURVEYS. EXPOSURES OF INTEREST GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), COUNTRY SURFACE AREA, POPULATION, GINI INDEX AND SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY). MAIN OUTCOMES LEVELS AND INEQUALITY IN THE COMPOSITE COVERAGE INDEX (CCI), A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF EIGHT RMNCH INTERVENTIONS. RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE INEQUALITIES WERE MEASURED THROUGH THE CONCENTRATION INDEX (CIX) AND SLOPE INDEX OF INEQUALITY (SII) FOR CCI, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS THE AVERAGE VALUES OF CCI (70.5% (SD=13.3)), CIX (5.3 (SD=5.1)) AND MEAN SLOPE INDEX (19.8 (SD=14.7)) WERE CALCULATED. IN THE UNADJUSTED ANALYSIS, ALL GOVERNANCE VARIABLES AND GDP WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CCI AND NEGATIVELY WITH INEQUALITIES. COUNTRY SURFACE SHOWED INVERSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH BOTH INEQUALITY INDICES. AFTER ADJUSTMENT, AMONG THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, ONLY POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO CCI (BETA=6.3; 95% CI 3.6 TO 9.1; P<0.001) AND INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RELATIVE (CIX; BETA=-1.4; 95% CI -2.4 TO -0.4; P=0.007) AND ABSOLUTE (SII; BETA=-5.3; 95% CI -8.9 TO -1.7; P=0.005) INEQUALITIES. THE STRONGEST ASSOCIATIONS WITH GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WERE FOUND IN THE POOREST WEALTH QUINTILE. SIMILAR PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED FOR GDP. COUNTRY SURFACE AREA WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO INEQUALITIES ON CCI. CONCLUSIONS LEVELS AND EQUITY IN RMNCH INTERVENTIONS ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, AND WITH GDP, AND INVERSELY ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRY SURFACE AREA.
160	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY KEY DETERMINANTS OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) INFLOWS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY USING UNBALANCED PANEL DATA SET PERTAINING TO THE YEARS 1990-2012. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS 20 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM THE WHOLE OF SOUTH, EAST AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - USING SEVEN EXPLANATORY VARIABLES (MARKET SIZE, TRADE OPENNESS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFLATION, INTEREST RATE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN CAPITAL), THE AUTHORS HAVE TRIED TO FIND THE BEST FIT MODEL FROM THE TWO MODELS CONSIDERED (FIXED EFFECT MODEL AND RANDOM EFFECT MODEL) WITH THE HELP OF HAUSMAN TEST. FINDINGS - FIXED EFFECT ESTIMATION INDICATES THAT MARKET SIZE, TRADE OPENNESS, INTEREST RATE AND HUMAN CAPITAL YIELD SIGNIFICANT COEFFICIENTS IN RELATION TO FDI INFLOW FOR THE PANEL OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES UNDER STUDY. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT MARKET SIZE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF FDI INFLOW. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - LIKE ANY OTHER STUDY, THIS WORK ALSO HAS SOME LIMITATIONS. LACK OF DATA ON KEY DETERMINANTS SUCH AS LABOR COST, EXCHANGE RATE, CORRUPTION, NATURAL RESOURCES, EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL RISK MAY BE CONSIDERED ONE SUCH LIMITATION. FURTHER, CONTROLLING FOR VARIABLES SUCH AS EXCHANGE RATE, CORRUPTION, LABOR COST AND POLITICAL RISK COULD MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS STUDY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY MAKERS, MANGERS AND INVESTORS. POLICY MAKERS WOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF FDI MENTIONED IN THE PAPER, AND TAKE STEPS TO FORMULATE POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE FDI. SUCH MEASURES COULD INCLUDE DEVELOPING MARKET SIZE, MAKING REGULATIONS MORE INTERNATIONAL TRADE FRIENDLY AND INVESTING IN THE NATION'S HUMAN CAPITAL. FURTHER, STEPS COULD BE TAKEN TO KEEP INTEREST RATES AND INFLATION RATES UNDER CONTROL AS THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO INFLUENCE FDI. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE SAMPLE OF 20 DEVELOPING NATIONS CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY HAS NOT BEEN CONSIDERED BY ANY STUDY EARLIER. THIS IS A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO EXISTING BODY OF RESEARCH, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE ORIGINALITY VALUE OF THIS PAPER.
161	CURRENT ISSUES OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL GUARANTEES OF ECONOMIC SECURITY AND SOME PROPOSALS FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT OUTLINE THE DEVELOPMENTS SET OUT IN THIS ARTICLE. IT IS STATED THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF NATIONAL SECURITY OF UKRAINE AND IS ITS MATERIAL BASIS. THE CONCEPT OF ECONOMIC SECURITY IS FORMULATED AND ITS COMPONENTS ARE SINGLED OUT. THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES OF ECONOMIC SECURITY ARE ANALYZED. IT IS STATED THAT, ACCORDING TO THE MAIN INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS, THE STATE GUARANTEE OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC RIGHTS, ECONOMIC SECURITY IN PARTICULAR, IS CARRIED OUT GRADUALLY, WITHIN THE MAXIMUM LIMITS OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES. IT IS STATED THAT THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS AN EFFECTIVE GUARANTEE OF PROTECTION OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND OTHER RIGHTS OF CITIZENS OF UKRAINE, ECONOMIC SECURITY OF THE STATE. THE MAIN NATIONAL GUARANTEES OF ECONOMIC SECURITY OF UKRAINE ARE DESCRIBED. IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE ECONOMIC SECURITY, A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN FORMULATED TO ADOPT THE LAW OF UKRAINE "ON ECONOMIC SECURITY OF UKRAINE", WHICH SHOULD CLEARLY DEFINE ITS CONCEPTS, COMPONENTS, PRINCIPLES OF PROVISION, ETC. THE MAIN THREATS TO UKRAINE'S ECONOMIC SECURITY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. IT IS STATED THAT AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF UKRAINE'S DEVELOPMENT, THE GREATEST THREAT TO UKRAINE'S ECONOMIC SECURITY IS AN ARMED ATTACK BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE TEMPORARY OCCUPATION OF PART OF UKRAINE'S TERRITORY. PROPOSALS FOR UKRAINE TO TAKE MEASURES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY GUARANTEE ECONOMIC SECURITY (ENSURING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE ECONOMY ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, RULE OF LAW, STABILITY, FREEDOM OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY, PRIORITY OF NATIONAL INTERESTS OF UKRAINE; CESSATION OF ARMED AGGRESSION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AGAINST UKRAINE AND RETURN OF TEMPORARILY OCCUPIED PART OF UKRAINE; REAL AND MAXIMUM PROVISION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, IMPROVEMENT OF MECHANISMS FOR REMOVING THE ECONOMY FROM THE SHADOW SPHERE, ELIMINATION OF CORRUPTION IN ECONOMIC AND OTHER SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE, ETC.).
162	WHEN AN INSIDER TRADES IN HIS OWN CORPORATION'S STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL, NONPUBLIC INFORMATION, COURTS APPLY WHAT IS CALLED THE "CLASSICAL THEORY" OF INSIDER TRADING. THIS THEORY IS THE FOUNDATION OF U.S. INSIDER TRADING LAW. IT HAS BEEN INVOKED IN EVERY COURT OPINION ON THE SUBJECT FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES. YET, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE THEORY IS AN UNQUALIFIED FAILURE. THE REASON? BECAUSE IT FAILS TO DO WHAT A THEORY MUST, WHICH IS TO EXPLAIN SETTLED LAW AND PROVIDE ANSWERS TO UNSETTLED LAW THAT ARE INTUITIVELY APPEALING. WE NEED A NEW THEORY FOR THE CLASSIC CASE OF INSIDER TRADING, AND THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR THE JOB IS STARING US IN THE FACE THE MISAPPROPRIATION THEORY, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAS APPLIED ONLY TO INSIDER TRADING INVOLVING CORPORATE "OUTSIDERS," IS SUPERIOR TO THE CLASSICAL THEORY. IT DOES A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING WHAT COURTS ACTUALLY DO IN CLASSICAL INSIDER TRADING CASES. AND WITH RESPECT TO THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE STILL OPEN, IT YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE MORE INTUITIVELY APPEALING. REPLACING THE CLASSICAL THEORY WITH THE MISAPPROPRIATION THEORY WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF UNIFYING INSIDER TRADING LAW, RESULTING IN A SINGLE THEORY APPLICABLE TO BOTH INSIDERS AND OUTSIDERS ALIKE. TO BE SURE, FOR SOME COMMENTATORS, THE MISAPPROPRIATION THEORY'S MAIN DRAWBACK IS ITS SO-CALLED "BRAZEN FIDUCIARY PROBLEM"-THE FACT THAT, UNDER THAT THEORY, THE TRADER CAN AVOID INSIDER TRADING LIABILITY SIMPLY BY PRE-DISCLOSING TO THE BOARD AN INTENTION TO TRADE. HOWEVER, I ARGUE THAT THIS INFIRMITY CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATED WITH A SIMPLE DISCLOSURE RULE, PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE BOARDS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE ANY SUCH NOTICE RECEIVED BY THE BOARD. THE UNIFIED (MISAPPROPRIATION) THEORY OF INSIDER TRADING LAW THAT I ARGUE FOR HERE WOULD BRING MUCH NEEDED CLARITY TO THIS DOCTRINAL AREA. IT WOULD ALSO PROMOTE VALUES, INCLUDING CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
163	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE EU SYSTEM OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION ALLOWS ROOM FOR CONSTITUTIONAL PLURALISM. BY LOOKING AT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE LAW OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE COURT OF JUSTICE), IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE COURT HAS ANSWERED THAT QUESTION IN THE AFFIRMATIVE, THEREBY RESPECTING THE DIVERSITY OF THE CULTURES AND TRADITIONS OF THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE AS WELL AS THEIR NATIONAL IDENTITIES. THE APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER DOES NOT RULE OUT A CUMULATIVE APPLICATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THAT BEING SAID, PLURALISM IS NOT ABSOLUTE, BUT MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE INDIVISIBLE AND UNIVERSAL VALUES ON WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION IS FOUNDED. LOGICALLY, THE QUESTION THAT ARISES IS HOW WE ORDER PLURALISM. IN THIS REGARD, I SHALL ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT FOR THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO DECIDE WHEN AN EU UNIFORM STANDARD OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION IS TO REPLACE (OR COEXIST WITH) NATIONAL STANDARDS. THAT DECISION IS FOR THE EU POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS TO ADOPT, SINCE THEY ENJOY THE NECESSARY DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY TO DETERMINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE EXERCISE OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IS TO BE LIMITED FOR REASONS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. HOWEVER, THIS DEFERENCE TO THE EU POLITICAL BRANCHES DOES NOT MEAN THAT EU LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS ARE IMMUNE FROM JUDICIAL REVIEW. ON THE CONTRARY, CASES SUCH AS SCHWARZ AND DIGITAL RIGHTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COURT OF JUSTICE IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO EXAMINING WHETHER THOSE LEGISLATIVE CHOICES COMPLY WITH PRIMARY EU LAW, AND NOTABLY WITH THE CHARTER. IN THIS REGARD, WHEN INTERPRETING THE PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER, THE COURT OF JUSTICE - IN DIALOGUE WITH NATIONAL COURTS AND, IN PARTICULAR, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS - OPERATES AS THE GUARANTOR OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EU, OF WHICH FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE PART AND PARCEL. IT IS THUS FOR THOSE COURTS TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH AND EVERY EU CITIZEN ENJOYS A SPHERE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WHICH MUST, AS DEFINED BY THE CHARTER, REMAIN FREE FROM PUBLIC INTERFERENCES.
164	THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE A SOCIAL PORTRAIT OF THE CORPS OF OFFICIALS ELECTED BY THE LOCAL NOBILITY - THE CHAIRMEN AND JURORS OF THE PROVINCIAL CHIEF COURTS AT THE END OF THE XVIIITH - THE FIRST THIRD OF THE XIXTH CENTURY UNDER CONDITIONS OF THE IMPERIAL PRACTICES APPLICATION OF FINDING COMPROMISES WITH THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RUSSIAN POWER IN THE REGION. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC (ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, GENERALIZATION) AND SPECIAL HISTORICAL (HISTORICAL GENETIC, HISTORICAL TYPOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL SYSTEMIC METHODS WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF HISTORICISM, SYSTEMATICS AND SCIENTIFICITY. THE METHOD OF CRITICISM AND CLASSIFICATION WAS USED DURING THE ANALYSIS OF THE ARCHIVAL MATERIALS. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY CONSISTS IN THE STUDY OF A SOCIAL PORTRAIT OF THE CHAIRMEN AND JURORS OF THE CHIEF COURTS DURING THE PROCESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP FORMATION OF THE SUPREME POWER WITH THE ELITE OF THE REGION, WHICH ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE JUDICIARY TO ENSURE THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE SOCIETY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE DYNAMICS OF PERSONNEL CHANGES AND BIOGRAPHICAL DATA, WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE IMPERIAL PRACTICES OF AN INDIRECT MANAGEMENT OF THE JUDICIARY, HAVE BEEN PRESENTED. THE CONCLUSIONS. TRYING TO FIND UNDERSTANDING WITH THE LOCAL ELITE, PAUL I RESTORED THE ELEMENTS OF THE POLISH-LITHUANIAN JUDICIARY SYSTEM. TO CONTROL THE JUDICIAL STRUCTURES, REVISION AND APPELLATE PROVINCIAL CHIEF COURTS WERE ESTABLISHED. THE EVIDENCE OF THE IMPERIAL PRACTICES APPLICATION WAS THE PERMISSION GIVEN TO THE NOBILITY TO ELECT A CHAIRMAN AND THE JURORS (WITH THE CONSENT OF THE AUTHORITIES). THE LOCAL ELITE NEEDED EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE GOVERNMENT, ON CONDITION OF LOYALTY, OFTEN INSTRUCTED MAYORS TO ACT AS GOVERNORS. THE OFFICIALS ACTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, SEEKING TO PREVENT THE IMBALANCE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SUPREME / LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE NOBILITY AND TO ENSURE PEACE IN THE REGION.
165	COMPRISING 57 MEMBER STATES, THE ORGANIZATION FOR ISLAMIC COOPERATION (OIC) IS THE SECOND LARGEST INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD AFTER THE UNITED NATIONS. ITS MEMBERSHIP EXTENDS FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA, SOUTH ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST TO AFRICA, EURASIA, THE BALKANS AND SOUTH AMERICA. IN 2005, OIC LAUNCHED A REFORM PROGRAM THAT CULMINATED IN ADOPTING A REVISED CHARTER IN 2008 REPLACING THE CHARTER OF 1972. THE NEW CHARTER SEEMED TO REFLECT AN INCREASED PROMINENCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WITHIN THE OIC, AND IT PAVED THE WAY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OIC'S INDEPENDENT PERMANENT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (IPHRC). IN ADDITION TO THE STIPULATION THAT IPHRC WILL BE ONE OF THE ELEVEN PRIMARY ORGANS OF THE OIC, THE NEW CHARTER EXPRESSES THE OIC'S DETERMINATION TO "PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, GOOD GOVERNANCE, RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY", AND "SAFEGUARD AND PROMOTE THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE" IN MEMBER STATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION TO THESE TRANSFORMATIONS, OIC APPEAR TO BE MORE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT, AND THE INCREASING NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE OIC, PARTICULARLY ITS HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS AND DISCOURSE, THIS PAPER TRIES TO HAVE A GENERAL ANALYSIS ON SUBJECT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT FOR SOME RESEARCHERS (MAYER. 2015) THE OIC'S RECORD IS SHOWN TO BE FULL OF CONFUSING AND EVEN SELF-CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS ON ISLAM AND HUMAN RIGHTS. FOR THEM, OIC IS NOT A COMPETENT ORGANIZATION FOR PROMOTING THE HUMAN RIGHTS AS A UNIVERSAL VALUE. AS OUR MAJOR QUESTION, THE PAPER SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE INDEX GROWTH OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THEIR CRITERIA IN OIC. WHICH ARE THE MAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN OIC? HAS OIC BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE MEMBER STATES AND IN THE WORLD? TO CARRY OUT THE RESEARCH, A DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL METHOD IS SELECTED AND BASED ON OIC DOCUMENTS, IT WILL BE A DOCUMENTED ANALYSIS.
166	THE CRACKDOWN IS THE EXECUTIVE DECISION TO INTENSIFY THE SEVERITY OF ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS AS TO A SELECTED CLASS OF OFFENDERS OR OFFENSES. EACH YEAR, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL PROSECUTORS AND AGENCIES CARRY OUT THOUSANDS OF CRACKDOWNS ON EVERYTHING FROM TRESPASSING TO INSIDER TRADING TO MINIMUM-WAGE VIOLATIONS AT NAIL SALONS. DESPITE CRACKDOWNS' UBIQUITY, LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS DEVOTED LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE CRACKDOWN AND TO THE DISTINCTIVE LEGAL AND POLICY CHALLENGES THAT CRACKDOWNS CAN POSE. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN EXAMINATION AND A CRITIQUE OF THE CRACKDOWN AS A TOOL OF PUBLIC LAW. THE CRACKDOWN CAN BE A BENIGN AND VALUABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNIQUE. BUT CRACKDOWNS CAN ALSO STRETCH STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO THE BREAKING POINT, THREATEN TO INFRINGE ON CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES, GENERATE UNJUST OR ABSURD RESULTS, AND SERVE THE VENAL INTERESTS OF THE LAW ENFORCER AT THE EXPENSE OF THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC. SURVEYING A SPECTRUM OF CRACKDOWNS FROM THE CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXTS, AND FROM LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL LAW, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE MANY WAYS THAT CRACKDOWNS MAY QUIETLY SUBVERT DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THE OBVIOUS CHALLENGE, THEN, IS TO DISCOURAGE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PATHOLOGICAL CRACKDOWNS, WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A LEGAL AND POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT IMPOSES SPARSE RESTRAINTS ON THE CRACKDOWN CHOICE. THIS ARTICLE LOCATES A FOUNDATION FOR TACKLING THIS CHALLENGE IN THE REQUIREMENT OF "FAITHFUL" EXECUTION IN ARTICLE II'S TAKE CARE CLAUSE AND ITS COGNATE CLAUSES IN THE STATE CONSTITUTIONS. THE CRACKDOWN DECISION SHOULD BE FAITHFUL-TO STATUTORY TEXT AND CONTEXT, TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC, AND TO CONSTITUTIONAL AND RULE-OF-LAW VALUES. BY ELABORATING THE CONTENT OF THIS OBLIGATION, THIS ARTICLE SUPPLIES A NOVEL NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE CRACKDOWN-AND A MUCH-NEEDED LEGAL PLATFORM FOR GOVERNING IT. CUTTING SHARPLY AGAINST THE GRAIN OF MODERN LAW, THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR A BROAD RETHINKING OF THE PRINCIPLES AND CONSTRAINTS THAT SHOULD FRAME THE EXECUTIVE'S POWER TO SELECTIVELY AND PROGRAMMATICALLY AUGMENT ENFORCEMENT.
167	THE OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THE LAW IS ONE OF THE BEDROCKS OF LEGALITY. IT IS ALSO A POWERFUL AND ATTRACTIVE REASON FOR GIVING STATUTORY LANGUAGE THE MEANING IT HAS IN EVERYDAY DISCOURSE. TO DO OTHERWISE WOULD BE TO HIDE THE LAW FROM THOSE IT GOVERNS. OR SO THE ARGUMENT GOES. DESPITE ITS INTUITIVE FORCE, THE FAIR NOTICE ARGUMENT FOR TEXTUALISM IS VULNERABLE TO TWO CHALLENGES. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS TO THE NOTION THAT FAIR NOTICE REQUIRES CONGRUENCE BETWEEN ORDINARY AND LEGAL MEANING. THERE IS NO NORMATIVE GAUGE FOR DETERMINING THE TIME AND EXPENSE PEOPLE OUGHT TO SPEND LEARNING THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OR THE AMOUNT OF SKILL THEY SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO POSSESS. AND FAIR NOTICE IS NOT NECESSARILY IMPAIRED BY RECOURSE TO EXTRATEXTUAL SOURCES SO LONG AS THE RULES OF INTERPRETATION TELL OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS WHICH MATERIALS TO CONSULT AND WHICH APPROACH TO ADOPT WHEN READING LAW. THE SECOND CHALLENGE ARISES FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW, MORALITY, AND NOTICE. SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS AND ETHICAL NORMS MAY PROVIDE THE REQUISITE NOTICE. ALTERNATIVELY, THEY MAY RENDER NOTICE LESS ESSENTIAL. FAIR NOTICE IS EITHER SUPERFLUOUS OR SATISFIED WHERE THE COMMUNITY REGARDS THE PROSCRIBED BEHAVIOR AS WRONGFUL AND THE PUNISHMENT FITTING. CONVERSELY, THE DEMANDS OF FAIR NOTICE ARE HEIGHTENED WHEN THE BEHAVIOR REACHED BY THE STATUTE IS INNOCUOUS OR WHEN THE SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATION ARE DISPROPORTIONATE. THE VIGOR OF THESE TWO CHALLENGES IS EMPIRICALLY TESTED THROUGH A SURVEY EXPERIMENT FIELDED ON A PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF THE UNITED STATES ADULT POPULATION BY THE NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LAY JUDGMENTS OF FAIR NOTICE ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SEVERITY OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT CONDITIONAL ON OUTCOME, JUDICIAL RELIANCE ON LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND HISTORY OFFENDS POPULAR NOTIONS OF FAIR NOTICE ONLY WHEN THE LAW TELLS COURTS TO PRIVILEGE THE ORDINARY MEANING OF STATUTES. THE FINDINGS CALL INTO QUESTION CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ABOUT TEXTUALISM, FAIR NOTICE, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
168	A PROMISING NEW SCHOOL OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION HAS EMERGED THAT TRIES TO WED THE WORK OF CONGRESS WITH THAT OF THE COURTS BY TYING INTERPRETATION TO CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE TO THIS PROCESS-BASED INTERPRETIVE APPROACH IS THE DIFFICULTY IN RECONSTRUCTING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. SCHOLARS HAVE PROPOSED LEVERAGING CONGRESS'S PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORKS AND RULES AS RELIABLE HEURISTICS TO THAT END. THIS ARTICLE STARTS FROM THAT PREMISE BUT WILL ADD WRINKLES TO IT. THE COMPLICATIONS STEM FROM THE FACT THAT EACH RULE IS ADOPTED FOR DISTINCT REASONS AND IS APPLIED DIFFERENTLY ACROSS CONTEXTS. AS INVESTIGATION INTO THESE PARTICULARITIES PROCEEDS, IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE COMPLICATIONS ARE ALSO ROOTED IN SOMETHING DEEPER THAT CONGRESS'S PROCEDURES ARE OFTEN HOLLOW, EVEN FRAUDULENT. CONGRESS, IT TURNS OUT, BREAKS ITS OWN RULES WITH IMPUNITY. WHICH BRINGS US TO A DEEPER RIDDLE: WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RULES TO AN INTERPRETER WHEN CONGRESS ROUTINELY FLOUTS THEM? IF ONE'S GOAL IS TO ACCURATELY DEPICT THE LAWMAKING PROCESS IN HOPES OF DERIVING RULES OF CONSTRUCTION THAT HAVE DEMOCRATIC ROOTS, THEN SURELY THE INTERPRETER MUST DISCARD THE RULES AS HOPELESSLY UNRELIABLE GUIDEPOSTS. THEN AGAIN, IF THE INTERPRETER'S ULTIMATE AIM IS TO SERVE DEMOCRATIC ENDS, THEN SHOULDN'T WE STRIVE TOWARD RULE OF LAW VALUES, ENSURING THAT CONGRESS ACTS IN AN HONORABLE WAY? ULTIMATELY, I RESOLVE THE QUESTION BY FIRST ASKING WHAT THE RULES ARE MEANT TO DO. ONLY THEN CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO INTERPRET BY THEM. THROUGH EXAMINATION OF MANY PROCEDURAL CONTEXTS, I SET FORTH AN INNOCUOUS ACCOUNT OF CONGRESSIONAL DEFIANCE OF THE RULES. RATHER THAN A SYMPTOM OF BRANCH DYSFUNCTION, WE SHOULD SEE THE RULES AS GUIDELINES THAT ATTEMPT TO ORDER CONGRESSIONAL BUSINESS BUT THAT ULTIMATELY MUST GIVE WAY TO POLITICS. NONETHELESS, SOME RULES CAN HELP THE INTERPRETER PAINT A MORE FAITHFUL PICTURE OF CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURE IN SPITE OF THEIR NOT BEING FOLLOWED. MORE BROADLY, I CONCLUDE THAT INTERPRETIVE PRESUMPTIONS DERIVING FROM THE GENERAL EFFICACY OF LEGISLATIVE RULES, RATHER THAN THEIR PRECISE ENFORCEMENT, ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN MIRRORING CONGRESSIONAL REALITY.
169	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS A DOMAIN OF GOVERNANCE AND TRADE FREEDOM INDICATORS IN ORDER TO REVEAL SOME OF THE DIMENSIONS ALONG WHICH THE MENA REGION'S INTRA-REGIONAL TRADE AND EXPORT INTENSITY MIGHT BE FOSTERED. HISTORICALLY, CONFLICTS, CRISES AND OIL INTERESTS HAVE IMPEDED INTRA-MENA INTEGRATION EFFORTS AND KEPT TRADE-FLOW INTENSITIES BETWEEN THE REGION'S COUNTRIES BELOW THOSE OF ITS TRADE WITH ROW. BUT IT SEEMS EVIDENT THAT SIMILARITIES IN THE GOVERNANCE AND TRADE FREEDOM INDICATORS OF MENA COUNTRIES WOULD PROMOTE SUCH TRADE FLOWS. OUR EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY HERE IS TO USE A CLASSICAL TRADE GRAVITY MODEL WITH AUGMENTED VARIABLES TO MEASURE INTRA-REGIONAL TRADE AND EXPORT FLOWS FOR MENA COUNTRIES AND COMPARE THEM WITH FLOWS FOR MENA_E.U. AND MENA_ROW. WE DEVELOP THREE SETS OF SCENARIOS TO CAPTURE THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE AND TRADE FREEDOM INDICATORS ACCORDINGLY: FIRST, WE INTRODUCE A STANDARDISED POLITY INDEX TO MEASURE ITS IMPACT ON ACCELERATING INTRA MENA'S EXPORT FLOWS COMPARED WITH MENA_EU AND MENA_ROW. SECOND, WE INTRODUCE A RANGE-BASED POLITY IV INDEX AND TRADE FREEDOM INDEX TO TEST WHETHER SIMILARITY IN THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS OF MENA COUNTRIES LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT INTRA-REGIONAL TRADE FLOWS. WE ALSO TEST THE INTERACTION BETWEEN BOTH. FINALLY, TO CHECK THE ROBUSTNESS OF EXPORT FLOWS, WE INCLUDE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) AND THEIR SUB-COMPONENTS IN THE ESTIMATIONS. THE MAIN RESULT IS THAT WHEN TWO MENA TRADE PARTNERS ARE BOTH CLASSIFIED AS MIXED REGIMES UNDER THE POLITY IV INDEX RANGES, THE COEFFICIENT BECOMES HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AND BILATERAL TRADE FLOWS INCREASE BY 1.25%. COMPONENTS OF (WGI) SPECIFYING GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION INCREASE EXPORTS FOR MENA'S ORIGIN EXPORTER COUNTRIES. FINALLY, THE INTERACTION TERM (POLITY IV AND TRADE FREEDOM RANGES) CAPTURES CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE AND SELF-REGULATED SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED BY GOVERNING EXECUTIVES AND AUTHORITIES AS THEY SHIFT AWAY FROM PRESSURE AND INTEREST GROUPS. THIS LEADS TO HIGHER DEGREES OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND BENEFITS TO THE REGION'S TRADE FLOWS AND POLICIES.
170	EQUALITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF INTERACTION AND MUTUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE, BEING ONE OF THE MAIN SOCIAL AND LEGAL REGULATORS OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, REFLECTING THE DEGREE OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE OF THEIR SUBJECTS TO SOCIETY AND THE STATE, THE AVAILABILITY OF EQUAL RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND DUTIES FOR CITIZENS, AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF MEN AND WOMEN IS ONE OF THE MOST REVEALING EXAMPLES OF THE EXISTENCE OF PROBLEMS OF ESTABLISHING AND IMPLEMENTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY.THE DEGREE OF DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF MEN AND WOMEN IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN WHICH A PERSON IS RECOGNIZED AS THE HIGHEST VALUE REGARDLESS OF GENDER. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN RUSSIA, USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR WOMEN'S ACTION FOR 2017-2022, APPROVED BY THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT..THIS LEGAL ACT OBJECTIVELY AND COMPREHENSIVELY REVEALS THE EXISTING STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GENDER EQUALITY, REFLECTING THE EXISTING IMBALANCE OF THE RELEVANT RELATIONS, WHICH IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF THE NEED TO PROVIDE WOMEN WITH ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE HISTORICALLY ESTABLISHED STEREOTYPE OF THEIR SECONDARY ROLES AND SIGNIFICANCE FOR SOCIETY.THE AUTHOR COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PATERNALISTIC MODEL OF THE STATE'S RELATIONSHIP TO WOMEN REMAINS, WHICH CREATES THE PREREQUISITES FOR VIOLATING THE PRINCIPLE OF SEXUAL EQUALITY IN THE ABSENCE OF THE NECESSARY GROUNDS FOR THIS.AT THE SAME TIME, IGNORING BY THE LEGISLATOR THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE LEGAL STATUS OF MEN, INCLUDING AS INDIVIDUALS WITH FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, IS THE CAUSE OF A VIOLATION OF THE BALANCE OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF MEN AND WOMEN.THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK FOR THE LEGISLATOR TO IMPLEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF MEN AND WOMEN IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE GENDER POLICY.
171	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, STUDIES OF THE VICTORIAN NOVEL HAVE BEEN ENRICHED SIGNIFICANTLY BY A GROWING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP LOOKING TO THE LITERATURE AND LETTERS OF THE PERIOD TO AFFIRM FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL VALUE OF LIBERAL CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF CRITICAL DETACHMENT AND COMMUNICATIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCEDURES. IN THE PROCESS, THE WORKS OF GEORGE ELIOT (1819-1880) HAVE COME TO BE UNDERSTOOD NOT ONLY AS MODELING FORMS OF CRITICAL DETACHMENT AND RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING BUT ALSO AS IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO WHAT AMANDA ANDERSON HAS IDENTIFIED AS "THE EMERGENCE OF THE [HABERMASIAN] PUBLIC SPHERE IN ENLIGHTENMENT EUROPE, A HISTORICAL CONDITION IN WHICH CRITIQUE, ARGUMENT, AND DEBATE INFORM DEVELOPING POLITICAL PRACTICES AND INSTITUTIONS," WHICH "HELPED TO CONSOLIDATE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS THE LEGITIMATING FORCE OF PUBLIC OPINION AND THE RULE OF LAW, THE SUCCESSOR TO NOW DELEGITIMATED FORMS OF ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY." HOWEVER, I WILL ARGUE HERE THAT ELIOT'S EARLY WRITING IN PARTICULAR DEMONSTRATES A DISTINCT LACK OF FAITH IN THE POWER OF LIBERALISM AND ITS POLITICAL PROCEDURES AND THAT ELIOT'S EARLY WORK IN FACT EXPOSES THE ILLIBERAL TENDENCIES EMBEDDED IN THESE PROCEDURES. RATHER THAN ASSERTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE, ELIOT'S IMPORTANT EARLY NOVELS ADAM BEDE (1859) AND THE MILL ON THE FLOSS (1860) CONSISTENTLY LOOK BEYOND THEMSELVES, SO TO SPEAK, TO A PROVIDENTIAL AUTHORITY THAT EXCEEDS THE TENETS OF REALISM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT AND PROVIDE CLOSURE TO THE NOVELS. FOR EACH NOVEL, AESTHETIC COHERENCE IS SECURED NOT THROUGH "CRITIQUE, ARGUMENT, AND DEBATE" BUT THROUGH RECOURSE TO METAPHYSICS AND TO EXTRASOCIAL AND/OR EXTRAPROCEDURAL DECISIONS. IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES I ALIGN THIS PHENOMENON IN ELIOT'S EARLY WRITING WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL GERMAN LEGAL SCHOLAR CARL SCHMITT'S CONCEPT OF THE EXCEPTION IN ORDER TO ARGUE THAT, BY APPEALING TO THE LOGIC OF PROVIDENCE TO RESOLVE THEIR MOST INTRACTABLE LEGAL AND ETHICAL PROBLEMS, THESE EARLY NOVELS IN FACT DEMONSTRATE ELIOT'S AWARENESS OF THE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS OF PROCEDURALISM AS A LEGITIMATE DECISION-MAKING INSTRUMENT.
172	THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND CONTENT ANALYSES, THIS ARTICLE CONDUCTED A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE DRAFTING OF CHINA'S INTERNET SECURITY LAW (ISL) AND E-COMMERCE LAW (ECL). ALTHOUGH BOTH HAD MULTIPARTY PARTICIPANTS, THEY HAD VERY DIFFERENT SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES. CONTRARY TO FORMALISTIC PARTICIPATION IN THE ISL, THE ECL'S DRAFTING INVOLVED CONSIDERABLE COMMUNICATION AND NEGOTIATION. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS INTENDED BY THE CENTRAL PARTY GIVEN ITS INTERESTS, AND IT WAS REALIZED THROUGH ITS CONTROL OVER THE SCOPE, PRINCIPLE, DIRECTION AND FOCUS OF THE PARTICIPATION IN THE DRAFTING, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS LEADERSHIP CONTROL'. THIS CONFIRMS THE EXISTENCE OF CONSULTATIVE AUTHORITARIANISM IN CHINA'S CENTRAL LAWMAKING SYSTEMS. THE DIFFERENCE CONTRIBUTES TO THE THEORY BY OUTLINING INDIRECT INSTITUTIONALIZED CONTROL OF THE CENTRAL PARTY. THIS MODE OF CONTROL CAUSES THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO OCCASIONALLY BE RESPONSIVE AND CONSULTATIVE, AND AT TIMES FRAGMENTED, IN REALIZING ITS INTEREST IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. SUCH A POLITY STILL PRESENTS LIMITS IN TERMS OF RELIEVING CONTRADICTIONS IN CHINA. POWER MANIPULATION AND ATTITUDINAL AND FRAGMENTED PROBLEMS CAN EXAGGERATE SUCH DIFFERENCES AND RESULT IN THE DRAFTING OF UNREASONABLY POLARIZED LEGISLATION. INTERESTS AND SUBSTANTIVE POWER ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DETERMINING THE LIMITS AND EVOLVING DIRECTIONS OF CONSULTATIVE AUTHORITARIANISM. FOR FURTHER DEMOCRATIZATION, LEADERSHIP CONTROL MUST BE LIMITED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND SUCH LIMITS MUST BE AFFORDED SUBSTANTIVE POWER TO BECOME REAL AND PRACTICAL.
173	DON HERZOG'S BOOK SOVEREIGNTY RIP OFFERS A TOUR D'HORIZON OF ONE STRAND OF SOVEREIGNTY'S CONCEPTUAL HISTORY AND ITS CHANGING MEANINGS OVER TIME. IT CULMINATES IN A FEROCIOUS CALL TO BURY THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY AND REPLACE IT WITH CONCEPTS SUCH AS JURISDICTION, AUTHORITY AND STATE. BASED ON INSIGHTS FROM CONCEPTUAL HISTORY, IN PARTICULAR ABOUT BASIC CONCEPTS, THE REVIEW ESSAY CRITICIZES HERZOG'S APPROACH. IT QUESTIONS WHETHER ONE CAN CONVINCINGLY DENOUNCE THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY BY RELYING PREDOMINANTLY ON EPISODES FROM ANGLO-AMERICAN HISTORY AS HERZOG DOES. INSTEAD, THE ESSAY TELLS TWO ALTERNATIVE STORIES IN ORDER TO FIRST ARGUE THAT IGNORING OTHER NARRATIVES RISKS MISUNDERSTANDING AND MISINTERPRETING THE CURRENT RE-RISE OF SOVEREIGNTY-RELATED DISCOURSES AND THAT, SECOND, SOVEREIGNTY REMAINS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO UNDERSTAND HOW BOTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE AND MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE WORK. EVENTUALLY IT WOULD BE MORE PERNICIOUS TO DISCARD THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY INSTEAD OF ENGAGING WITH IT AND CONFRONTING ITS DIVERGING CONCEPTIONS.
174	THE SUBJECT. FEATURES OF THE ORGANIZATION OF JUSTICE AND THE QUALITY OF PROCEDURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE USSR IN THE 1930S. THE PURPOSE. THE DETERMINATION OF HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT IN THE USSR IN THE 1930S AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN THIS PERIOD. METHODOLOGY. THE AUTHOR USES HISTORICAL LEGAL METHOD, FORMAL LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES, THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL STATISTICS. RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. AFTER THE CRIMINAL LAW CAMPAIGNS OF THE EARLY 1930S THE JUDGMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS IN A DISTURBED CONDITION. THE SOVIET CIVIL PROCESS WAS ALMOST ABSOLUTELY ELIMINATED. TENS THOUSANDS MATERIALS OF COURT CASES WERE LOST THROUGHOUT THE UNION EVERY YEAR. THE COURTS WERE EXTREMELY BUSY. THE COURTS USED ACCUSATORY APPROACH. THE PETITIONS OF THE ACCUSED WERE ALMOST NEVER SOLVED. PRISONERS WERE NOT HANDED COPIES OF THE INDICTMENTS. DURING THE TERROR OF THE OLD EVILS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WORSENED, THE DESTRUCTION OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BEGAN. THE TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETING CASES INCREASED. ALMOST HALF OF CRIMINAL CASES IN CASE OF COMPLAINT (APPEAL) HAS BEEN REVISED BY THE HIGHER COURTS. THE COURTS AGAIN APPLIED THE SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE. AT THE END OF THE 1930S THE PROCEDURAL REGULATION OF THE JUDICIAL WORK WAS THE DUTY OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARIAT OF JUSTICE OF THE USSR AND OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE USSR. USSR SUPREME COURT CONTINUED TO TAKE DECISIONS IN LITIGATION IN THE PLENUMS. THE BOARDS OF SUPREME COURT EXAMINES CASES INFLUENCING LAW OF PRACTICE. THE QUALITY OF JUDGMENT BY THE SUPREME COURTS OF THE REPUBLICS OF SOVIET UNION IN THE LATE 1930S DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY IN COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS PERIOD. THIS WAS DUE TO CONSTANT STAFF TURNOVER AND LOW LEVEL OF QUALIFICATION OF JUDGES. THE SUPREME COURTS OF THE REPUBLICS HAD NO PLENUM, SO THEY COULD INFLUENCE LAW OF PRACTICE BY THE RULINGS OF OF THE BOARDS. THESE RULINGS WERE EXTREMELY IGNORANT IN MANY REPUBLICS. THE LOW QUALITY OF STAFF IN THE REGIONAL COURTS LED TO NUMEROUS ERRORS. THE ROLE OF STATISTICS IN ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF THE JUDICIARY INCREASED. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS BAD ORGANIZATION OF WORK OF THE COURTS. SO, DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF SECRETARIES, IN SOME REGIONS UP TO 50 % OF THE CASES APPOINTED FOR CONSIDERATION WERE SABOTAGED. LOW QUALIFICATION OF JUDGES OFTEN LED TO COMICAL OR CONTROVERSIAL RESOLUTION OF CASES. CONCLUSIONS. TIMID ATTEMPTS OF THE SUPREME BODIES OF JUSTICE TO REHABILITATE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE MID 1930S WERE FRUSTRATED DURING THE CAMPAIGN OF THE GREAT TERROR IN 1936-1938 YEARS. THE CYCLE OF RULE OF LAW (1933-1936) WAS REPLACED BY A NEW CYCLE OF LAWLESSNESS. SINCE 1938 THE AUTHORITIES BEGAN TO MAKE EFFORTS TO RESTORE NORMAL PROCEEDINGS. THE AUTHORS DISTINGUISH THE FOLLOWING MAIN REASONS OF INEFFICIENT WORK OF JUDICIAL BODIES OF THE USSR IN 1930S: THE LOW QUALIFICATION OF THE JUDGES, THE DEPENDENCE OF COURTS ON LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, THE INABILITY TO NORMALLY PERFORM SOME JUDICIAL ACTS, NOT SATISFACTORY LOGISTICAL SUPPORT OF COURT ACTIVITIES, THE NOISY AND SENSELESS POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, UNLEASHED BY STALIN. REPUBLICS HAD NO PLENUM, SO THEY COULD INFLUENCE LAW OF PRACTICE BY THE RULINGS OF OF THE BOARDS. THESE RULINGS WERE EXTREMELY IGNORANT IN MANY REPUBLICS. THE LOW QUALITY OF STAFF IN THE REGIONAL COURTS LED TO NUMEROUS ERRORS. THE ROLE OF STATISTICS IN ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF THE JUDICIARY INCREASED. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS BAD ORGANIZATION OF WORK OF THE COURTS. SO, DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF SECRETARIES, IN SOME REGIONS UP TO 50 % OF THE CASES APPOINTED FOR CONSIDERATION WERE SABOTAGED. LOW QUALIFICATION OF JUDGES OFTEN LED TO COMICAL OR CONTROVERSIAL RESOLUTION OF CASES. CONCLUSIONS. TIMID ATTEMPTS OF THE SUPREME BODIES OF JUSTICE TO REHABILITATE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE MID 1930S WERE FRUSTRATED DURING THE CAMPAIGN OF THE GREAT TERROR IN 1936-1938 YEARS. THE CYCLE OF RULE OF LAW (1933-1936) WAS REPLACED BY A NEW CYCLE OF LAWLESSNESS. SINCE 1938 THE AUTHORITIES BEGAN TO MAKE EFFORTS TO RESTORE NORMAL PROCEEDINGS. THE AUTHORS DISTINGUISH THE FOLLOWING MAIN REASONS OF INEFFICIENT WORK OF JUDICIAL BODIES OF THE USSR IN 1930S: THE LOW QUALIFICATION OF THE JUDGES, THE DEPENDENCE OF COURTS ON LOCAL AND CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, THE INABILITY TO NORMALLY PERFORM SOME JUDICIAL ACTS, NOT SATISFACTORY LOGISTICAL SUPPORT OF COURT ACTIVITIES, THE NOISY AND SENSELESS POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, UNLEASHED BY STALIN.
175	THE GERMAN FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S CLIMATE DECISION PROVIDES A NUANCED ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RELEVANCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR CRITICALLY ASSESSES HOW THE COURT INNOVATIVELY SOUGHT TO CAPTURE THE INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY DIMENSION OF CLIMATE MITIGATION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE DUTIES STEMMING FROM CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW DESPITE PROGRESSIVE FINDINGS ON INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY AND THE INNOVATIVE INVOCATION OF NEGATIVE DUTIES, THE OPERATIVE PART OF THE DECISION TURNED OUT TO BE RATHER LIMITED. BECAUSE OF REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE ALLOWABLE NATIONAL CARBON BUDGET, THE COURT WAS UNABLE TO REQUIRE THE LEGISLATOR TO ENACT A STRICTER REDUCTION PATH. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE COURT COULD HAVE NARROWED REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES, WITHOUT ENGAGING IN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, BY ADOPTING AN INTERNATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL MINIMUM APPROACH TO CALCULATING THE NATIONAL BUDGET AND BY ADJUSTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE GERMAN LEGISLATOR, BY GOING BEYOND WHAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE COURT "TRAPPED ITSELF" ON AN AMBITIOUS REDUCTION PATH, OPENING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINTS.
176	PURPOSETHE CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN THE NEGATIVE GAP BETWEEN BIOCAPACITY AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT HAS REMAINED GLOBALLY PERSISTENT SINCE EARLY 1970. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CAPITAL, DOMESTIC CAPITAL FORMATION, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND DEMOCRACY ON ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT WITHIN A GLOBAL PANEL OF 101 COUNTRIES FROM 1995 TO 2017. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHE EMPIRICAL PROCEDURE IS BASED ON DATA MIX. TO THIS END, THIS STUDY USES A BATTERY OF TESTING AND ESTIMATION APPROACHES BOTH CONVENTIONAL (NO CROSS-SECTIONAL DEPENDENCE [CD]) AND NOVEL APPROACHES (ACCOUNTING FOR CD). AMONG THE BATTERY OF ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES USED, THERE ARE THE DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE, THE MEAN GROUP, THE COMMON CORRELATION EFFECT MEAN GROUP TECHNIQUE, THE AUGMENTED MEAN GROUP TECHNIQUE, THE POOLED MEAN GROUP AND THE DYNAMIC COMMON CORRELATION EFFECT TECHNIQUE WITH THE DESIRE TO OBTAIN OUTCOMES ROBUST TO HETEROSKEDASTICITY, ENDOGENEITY, CROSS-CORRELATION AND CD AMONG OTHERS. FINDINGSTHE ESTIMATED OUTCOMES INDICATE THAT USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATORS' DOMESTIC CAPITAL FORMATION CONSISTENTLY DEGRADES THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH AN INCREASE IN ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT, WHILE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY CONSISTENTLY ENHANCES THE QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT. FURTHER, THE OUTCOME REVEALS THAT, THOUGH FOREIGN CAPITAL INFLOW DEGRADES THE ENVIRONMENT, THE TIME PERIOD IS ESSENTIAL, AS IT SHOWS A SHORT-RUN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT AND A LONG-RUN ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. DEMOCRATIC ACTIVITIES SHOW A MIXED OUTCOME WITH SHORT-RUN DEGRADING EFFECT AND A LONG-RUN ENHANCEMENT EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSGREEN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE THE POLICY TARGET OF ALL ECONOMIES, AND THESE POLICIES SHOULD BE ADOPTED TO TARGET BOTH DOMESTIC CAPITAL AND FOREIGN CAPITAL ALIKE. SECOND, THE ADOPTION OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES WILL PRODUCE GOOD LEADERS THAT WILL NOT JUST DESIGN SHORT-TERM POLICIES TO BLINDFOLD THE POPULACE TEMPORARY BUT THOSE THAT WILL PRODUCE LONG-TERM-ORIENTED PRACTICES THAT WILL BETTER AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF THE GLOBAL FOOTPRINT. EQUALLY, ENHANCING THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK LIKE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN MATTERS OF ABATEMENT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED. ORIGINALITY/VALUEALTHOUGH MUCH RESEARCH ON THE ROLE OF MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HAS BEEN DONE THIS FAR, DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES, INTUITIONAL QUALITY AND DOMESTIC CAPITAL HAVE BEEN GIVEN LITTLE ATTENTION. THIS RESEARCH FILLS THIS GAP BY CONSIDERING ROBUST EMPIRICAL TECHNIQUES.
177	PROVIDING THE STABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT A UNIFIED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER BY ALL PARTICIPANTS OF LEGAL RELATIONS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SUCH UNIFIED UNDERSTANDING IS ACHIEVED ONLY THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF UNITED CONTENT STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DURING THE PROCEDURE OF A SPECIALIZED CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM CAN ALSO BE FOUND IN THE CONTRADICTORY OR INADEQUATE (LACUNAL) LEGAL REGULATION OF SPECIFIC RELATIONS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, ALONG WITH ORDINARY LAWMAKING, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO CONSIDER ACTS OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION THAT GENERALIZE A DIVERSE JUDICIAL PRACTICE, AS A CORRECT WAY OF RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. THE SECOND ASPECT CAN ARISE WHEN THE EXISTING NATIONAL LEGISLATION IS ADJUSTED BY SUPRANATIONAL BODIES THAT CARRY OUT JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION. SUCH A NEED TO ASSESS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE RESULTS OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION ALLOWS TO SPEAK ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF A SPECIFIC SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION, WHICH IN TURN, HELPS TO ENSURE THE UNIFICATION OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS, AND TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AS THE MAIN FACTOR OF STABILITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A HIERARCHY OF THE RESULTS OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION RAISES THE ISSUE NOT ONLY ABOUT THE "TOP OF HIERARCHY", BUT ALSO ABOUT ENSURING THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AS WELL AS THE STABILITY AND COMPLETENESS OF ACTS OF INTERPRETATION, WHICH ARE THE NAMED "TOP" OF THE SYSTEM. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, THE INTERPRETATION EXERCISED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A HIGHER PRIORITY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE REAL ASSURANCE OF COMPLIANCE OF ALL SUBORDINATE FORMS OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE COMPLIANCE OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, IS ACHIEVED BY THE USE OF A SPECIFIC METHOD OF THE JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION, IMPLEMENTATION BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.
178	THE CHALLENGE OF VIOLENT RADICALIZATION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF ( THE PREVENT PILLAR) OF THE 2005 EU COUNTER-TERRORISM STRATEGY AND IS SPECIFICALLY DEALT WITH IN THE 2005 EU STRATEGY FOR COMBATING RADICALISATION AND RECRUITMENT TO TERRORISM. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE EU COUNTER-RADICALIZATION APPROACH BY COMPARING THE ABOVE MENTIONED STRATEGIES AND OTHER POLICY DOCUMENTS TO THEORETICAL NOTIONS ON RADICALIZATION AND COUNTER RADICALIZATION. IT FOCUSES ON THE COMPREHENSIVENESS, IMPLEMENTATION AND CONSISTENCY OF THE EU POLICIES THAT AIM TO PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM TURNING TO VIOLENCE, WHILE HALTING THE EMERGENCE OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF TERRORISTS.
179	SOUTH AFRICA IS HIGHLY CELEBRATED FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS HAS ALSO FOSTERED "RIGHTS CONSCIOUSNESS" AMONG THE CITIZENRY WHICH HAS BECOME OF ESSENCE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN WHO HAD LONG BEEN IN THE "LEGAL COLD". HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE "RIGHTS CONCEPTS" IS MARRED BY THE EXTREME LEVELS OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. THE EFFECT OF CRIMES SUFFERED BY WOMEN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA'S POST-APARTHEID SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE AND THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS FOUNDED ON HUMAN RIGHTS. WITH SOUTH AFRICA'S HISTORY, IT IS ASSUMED THAT LAW HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM SOCIETIES IN ENSURING THE FULFILMENT OF RIGHTS AS ENVISAGED IN MANY NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE RECENT SHOCKING WAVE OF THE EXTREME LEVELS OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN EXPERIENCED IN SOUTH AFRICA WITH THE RESULTANT CONSEQUENCE OF THE AGITATION OF THE PUBLIC ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. WHILST IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LAW AND THE CHALLENGES FACED BY WOMEN, IT ARGUES AGAINST PUBLIC OPINION THAT SEEM TO WITHER THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THE STATE RELATING TO THE FUNCTIONING OF THE JUDICIARY. IT ALSO ARGUES THAT PUBLIC OPINION WATERS DOWN THE ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE LAW IN GENERATING SOCIAL CHANGE. IN ADDITION, THE CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY CANNOT BE REPLACED BY INVIDIOUS PHILOSOPHIES THAT APPEAR TO COMPROMISE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AS ENVISAGED IN THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS. THE ARGUMENT ADVANCED HEREIN IS LIMITED TO THE RATIONALITY OF THE CALLS BY FURTHER RAISING A QUESTION WHETHER SAFEGUARDING INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY OF THE JUDICIARY SHOULD BE OUTWEIGHED BY PUBLIC OUTRAGE ON GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE. IT ALSO DOES NOT PROFESS TO PROVIDE AN EXPERT ANALYSIS OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THESE AREAS. OVERALL, THE PAPER ACKNOWLEDGES AND SHARES THE CONCERNS BY THE PUBLIC ON THE ELIMINATION OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE; HOWEVER, IT REFUSES THE INDIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION ON THE TRAMPLING OF JUDICIAL AUTHORITY.
180	BACKGROUND: SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST IN THE FUNCTIONING OF INSTITUTIONAL DESIGNS AND ORGANISATIONAL PRACTICES IN PURCHASING WITHIN FREE HEALTHCARE SCHEMES IN LOW RESOURCE COUNTRIES. THE STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF THE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS TO SCALE UP STRATEGIC PURCHASING IN FREE HEALTHCARE POLICIES IN NIGERIA AND OTHER LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS FACING SIMILAR APPROACHES. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND IN TWO HEALTH DISTRICTS IN ENUGU STATE, NIGERIA, USING A QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY DESIGN. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 44 KEY HEALTH SYSTEM ACTORS (16 POLICYMAKERS, 16 PROVIDERS AND 12 HEALTH FACILITY COMMITTEE LEADERS) PURPOSIVELY SELECTED FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND THE TWO HEALTH DISTRICTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS WERE GUIDED BY SIDDIQI AND COLLEAGUES' HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A FRAMEWORK APPROACH. RESULTS: THE KEY FINDINGS SHOW THAT SUPPORTIVE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN PURCHASING INCLUDED SYSTEMS TO VERIFY QUESTIONABLE PROVIDER CLAIMS, PAY PROVIDERS DIRECTLY FOR SERVICES, COMPEL PROVIDERS TO PROCURE DRUGS CENTRALLY AND TRACK TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO PROVIDERS. HOWEVER, STRATEGIC VISION WAS UNDERMINED BY INSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS, ABSENCE OF PURCHASER-PROVIDER SPLIT AND LACK OF SELECTIVE CONTRACTING OF PROVIDERS. BENEFIT DESIGN WAS NOT BASED ON STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT. RULE OF LAW WAS LIMITED BY DELAYS IN PROVIDER PAYMENT. BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS TO USERS WERE NOT TRANSPARENT. THE CRITERIA AND PROCEDURE FOR RESOURCE ALLOCATION WERE UNCLEAR. SOME TARGET BENEFICIARIES SEEMED EXCLUDED FROM THE SCHEME. EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY WAS CONSTRAINED BY POOR ADHERENCE TO PURCHASING RULES. ACCOUNTABILITY OF PURCHASERS AND PROVIDERS TO USERS WAS WEAK. INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION IS CONSTRAINED BY PAPER-BASED SYSTEM. RATIONING OF FREE SERVICES BY PROVIDERS AND USERS' NON-ADHERENCE TO PRIMARY GATE-KEEPING ROLE HINDERED ETHICS. CONCLUSION: WEAK GOVERNANCE OF PURCHASING FUNCTION LIMITS POTENTIAL OF FMCHP TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE. APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR STRENGTHENING STRATEGIC PURCHASING IN THE FMCHP AND POSSIBLY FREE HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS IN OTHER LOW-RESOURCE COUNTRIES MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE CREATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS PURCHASING AGENCY, CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR SELECTIVE CONTRACTING, STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT, TRANSPARENT BENEFIT DESIGN, NEED-BASED RESOURCE ALLOCATION, EFFICIENT PROVIDER PAYMENT METHODS, STRONGER ROLES FOR CITIZENS, ENFORCEMENT OF GATEKEEPING RULES AND USE OF DATA FOR DECISION-MAKING.
181	THE AIM OF THIS PIECE OF RESEARCH IS TO ANALYSE THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENCES OF ARTICLE 52 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF ROMANIA, NAMELY THE GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHT OF A PERSON AGGRIEVED BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY. THEREFORE, THE GUARANTEE OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS HELPS ENSURE THE GOOD ADMINISTRATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE RESPECT FOR THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF ROMANIAN CITIZENS AND, IMPLICITLY, OF ROMANIAN BUSINESSES ENVIRONMENT. GOOD ADMINISTRATION CONCERNS THE INTEREST OF BOTH NATURAL PERSONS AND LEGAL PERSONS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE ECONOMIC CIRCUIT AND WHOSE RIGHTS ARE GRANTED BY THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW. GOOD ADMINISTRATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY GRANTING THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF A PERSON AGGRIEVED THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE DEED OR THROUGH A REQUEST WHICH WAS NOT SETTLED WITHIN THE LEGAL TIME LIMIT AND, AT THE SAME TIME, BY GRANTING TO THAT PERSON A RIGHT TO APPROACH THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES AND TO BE ENTITLED TO OBTAIN THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLAIMED RIGHT OR OF THE LEGITIMATE INTEREST, WITH THE ANNULMENT OF THE DEED AND THE REPAIR OF PREJUDICE, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY OF THE STATE FOR MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE, AS WELL AS ITS RIGHT OF RECOURSE AGAINST THE MAGISTRATES WHO ACTED IN BAD FAITH OR SERIOUS NEGLECT IN THEIR POSITION ARE ALSO GRANTED. THE METHODS USED IN DRAWING UP THIS STUDY ARE: THE COMPARATIVE METHOD USED TO IDENTIFY THE RIGHT OF A PERSON AGGRIEVED BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN THE ROMANIAN CONSTITUTIONS AND IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF OTHER STATES, AND THE HISTORICAL METHOD, WHICH WAS USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE STUDIED FIELD. THE LOGICAL METHOD SERVED TO ANALYSE THE CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE FIELD, WHILE THE SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD HELPED TO STUDY SOCIAL IMPACT. THE QUANTITATIVE METHOD WAS USED TO STUDY THE RELEVANT APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE CURRENT TRENDS AND THE NEED OF CITIZENS AND ECONOMIC ACTORS TO BENEFIT FROM GOOD ADMINISTRATION BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THE IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH FOR ENSURING THE GOOD ADMINISTRATION OF CITIZENS, ECONOMIC AGENTS AND IMPLICITLY, OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, REVEALS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO ENSURE THE SUPREME VALUES, GRANTED BY THE CONSTITUTION, NAMELY THE RIGHT OF A PERSON AGGRIEVED BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY, A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT ANALYSED IN THIS STUDY.
182	THE LAST DECADE HAS SEEN THE JUDICIARY'S LEGITIMACY COME UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY AS MORE AND MORE SENSITIVE AND POLITICALLY CHARGED BATTLES ARE FOUGHT IN THE COURTS. THESE HAVE NOT ONLY PLACED CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATORS IN AWKWARD SITUATIONS BUT RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE CHOSEN. THE PROCESS OF SELECTING JUDGES, GENERALLY, IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE MEANS THAT COULD BE USED BY THE OTHER TWO BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE WITH AND INFLUENCE THE JUDICIARY. ARE THEY CHOSEN THROUGH PROCEDURES THAT ENSURE THE APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS BASED ON THEIR TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL MERIT AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO DECIDE MATTERS INDEPENDENTLY, OBJECTIVELY AND FAIRLY? IS THERE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN THAT CAN FACILITATE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE CALIBRE OF INDEPENDENT-MINDED JUDGES THAT ARE NEEDED AT A TIME OF TREMENDOUS CHANGE AND WHEN THE THREATS TO SUSTAINING AFRICA'S FRAGILE ATTEMPTS TO ENTRENCH AN ETHOS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, GOOD GOVERNANCE, PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDER SIEGE BY PRO-AUTHORITARIAN FORCES MASQUERADING AS DEMOCRATS? THIS PAPER CRITICALLY EXAMINES, COMPARES AND CONTRASTS THE SYSTEMS THAT OPERATE IN SOME ANGLOPHONE, FRANCOPHONE AND LUSOPHONE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. IT STARTS BY UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE METHOD OF APPOINTING CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATORS. IT THEN EXAMINES THE DIVERGENT APPROACHES TO THE APPOINTMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATORS. FROM AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES USED, IT SHOWS THAT POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT, AND SOMETIMES INTERFERENCE LEADING TO POLITICISATION OF THE JUDICIARY, IS A COMMON PHENOMENON IN ALL JURISDICTIONS ON THE CONTINENT WITH THE DIFFERENCES BEING ONLY IN THE DEGREE OF INTERFERENCE. IT, THEREFORE, PROPOSES CONSTITUTIONAL ENTRENCHMENT OF A MODEL OF CONSTITUTING THE JUDICIAL SERVICE COMMISSIONS OR CONSEIL SUPERIEUR DE LA MAGISTRATURE THAT LIMITS THE POWERS OF THE EXECUTIVES, WHO OFTEN ALSO CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE. WHILST IT IS CLEARLY UNDESIRABLE BOTH FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE LAW AND THAT OF POLITICAL LEGITIMACY TO EXCLUDE POLITICIANS FROM PLAYING ANY ROLE IN THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES GENERALLY AND CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATORS IN PARTICULAR, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THEIR ROLE SHOULD BE REDUCED TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO MANIPULATE OR CONTROL JUDGES.
183	THE COMMON-LAW UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGALITY PRINCIPLE PROHIBITS COURTS FROM CREATING NEW CRIMES; EXTENDING THE DEFINITIONS OF EXISTING CRIMES; AND BROADENING THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF EXISTING CRIMES. THE AMBIT OF PROTECTION AFFORDED BY THE PRINCIPLE NULLUM CRIMEN SINE LEGE - NOW A GUARANTEED FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF EVERY ACCUSED PERSON IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ONLY SUPERFICIALLY IN MASIYA V DPP 2007 2 SACR 435 (CC). THIS DECISION HAS CAUSED A RE-EVALUATION OF THE PERMISSIBLE BOUNDARIES OF JUDICIAL CREATIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXTENSION OF THE DEFINITIONS OF CRIMES. IN DPP, WESTERN CAPE V PRINS 2012 2 SACR 183 (SCA) THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEAL EMPHASISED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE AND ITS PROPER INTERPRETATION IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DISPENSATION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CONSIDER THE COURTS' ROLE IN GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLE. A SYNOPSIS OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE IS PROVIDED BY CONSIDERING THE REASONS FOR RECOGNITION OF THIS RULE. THE CURRENT APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE IN CODIFIED AND UNCODIFIED FOREIGN LEGAL SYSTEMS IS DISCUSSED. THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE RULE IN SOUTH AFRICAN LAW ARE CONSIDERED CRITICALLY. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THAT, IN UNCODIFIED CRIMINAL-LAW SYSTEMS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ALSO IN CODIFIED LEGAL SYSTEMS, JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION INEVITABLY INVOLVES AN ELEMENT OF CREATIVITY AND CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWS FOR JUDICIAL ACTIVISM. ALTHOUGH FLEXIBILITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CRIMINAL LAW MAY BE DESIRABLE TO ADAPT THE LAW TO THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY, THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY REQUIRES THAT JUDGES EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN EXTENDING THE FIELD OF APPLICATION OF CRIMES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LEGALITY PRINCIPLE AS PART OF THE BROADER RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POWER CONFERRED ON COURTS IN TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTION TO DEVELOP THE COMMON LAW ACCORDING TO CONSTITUTIONAL IMPERATIVES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE POWER (AS ARGUED IN THE MASIYA DECISION) TO EXTEND THE DEFINITIONS OF CRIMES. AS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS, A PRINCIPLED APPROACH IS FAVOURED WHICH ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITS JUDICIAL EXTENSION OF THE DEFINITIONS OF CRIMES.
184	IN THE MODERN CONTEXT OF IMPROVING THE PROCESS OF STRENGTHENING OF NATIONAL SECURITY, SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE THE CLARIFICATION OF THE ROLE AND PLACE OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES IN THE STRUCTURE OF MECHANISM OF THE BELARUSIAN STATE IS REQUIRED. THE FUNCTIONAL ASSIGNMENT OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES DIRECTLY CONCERNS THE QUESTION OF THEIR PLACE AND ROLE IN THE FORMATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS THAT HAS NOT ONLY THEORETICAL BUT PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS, THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE DECLARATION "ON THE STATE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS" IS ANALYZED. THE ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE REFORM OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES, AS THE RESULT OF WHICH THE AUTHOR COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRANSFORMATION TAKING PLACE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES IS REFLECTION OF CHANGES IN THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE MODERN INSTITUTIONAL POWER. CONSEQUENTLY, THE HISTORY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IS A CLEAR PROOF THAT THEY TRADITIONALLY OCCUPIED A LEADING POSITION IN THE INSTITUTIONAL POWER. THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES, WITH THE LARGEST VOLUME OF LAW ENFORCEMENT POWER, ARE ABLE TO SOLVE THEIR TASKS AND PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE MECHANISM OF THE MODERN BELARUSIAN STATE. A NUMBER OF NUMEROUS REFORMS AND REORGANIZATIONS ALOUD TO COME TO CONCLUSION THAT THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES WERE ASSIGNED AND CONTINUE PUSHING AN OVERRIDING PLACE IN THE MECHANISM OF THE MODERN BELARUSIAN STATE. THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES OF BELARUS, THE IMPROVEMENT OF ITS ACTIVITIES IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF ITS FUNCTIONING. THE PROVISION OF FORMATION IN THE REPUBLIC INTEGRAL AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES IS NECESSARY TO SCIENTIFICALLY BASED CONSOLIDATION OF THEIR FUNCTIONS AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL, WHICH WILL INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND ENSURE RESPECT AND SUPPORT OF THE SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUALS. IN THIS CONTEXT THE NECESSITY OF AMENDING OF ARTICLE 1 OF THE LAW "ON THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS AGENCIES OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS" IS GROUNDED.
185	OVER 50,000 INTERNATIONAL TREATIES ARE IN FORCE TODAY, COVERING NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND NEARLY EVERY FACET OF STATE AUTHORITY. AND YET MANY OBSERVERS CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW-WITH ITS GENERAL ABSENCE OF CENTRAL ENFORCEMENT AND ITS TYPICALLY VOLUNTARY CHARACTER-IS INEFFECTIVE. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES AND RESPONDS TO THIS CHALLENGE. BUILDING UPON INSIGHTS FROM BOTH POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, IT OFFERS A THEORY OF STATE DECISIONS REGARDING TREATY LAW THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE KEY WAYS IN WHICH SUCH LAW SHAPES STATE BEHAVIOR. THIS INTEGRATED THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW SEEKS TO EXPLAIN WHY COUNTRIES WOULD COMMIT TO TREATIES THAT POTENTIALLY CONSTRAIN THEIR BEHAVIOR AND HOW TREATIES, ONCE ACCEPTED, INFLUENCE OR FAIL TO INFLUENCE STATE BEHAVIOR I ARGUE THAT COMMITMENT AND COMPLIANCE ARE RECIPROCAL INFLUENCES ON EACH OTHER IF COMPLIANCE IS VERY COSTLY OR CARRIES FEW BENEFITS, FOR INSTANCE, COUNTRIES WILL BE UNLIKELY TO JOIN A TREATY IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS A RESULT, STATES BEHAVE IN WAYS THAT STANDARD THEORIES MISS-FAILING TO JOIN TREATIES, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH WHICH THEY COULD EASILY COMPLY, OR JOINING TREATIES THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE INCLINATION TO OBEY. THE THEORY EMPHASIZES TWO CENTRAL MEANS BY WHICH TREATIES SHAPE WHAT COUNTRIES DO. THE FIRST IS THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES BY TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS AND BY RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS WITHIN NATIONS THAT JOIN THE TREATY. IN PARTICULAR, DOMESTIC ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS ARE A CRUCIAL FORCE PUSHING COUNTRIES TO COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL TREATIES-AND BECAUSE THEY ARE, THEY ARE ALSO A KEY INFLUENCE UPON COUNTRIES' WILLINGNESS TO JOIN SUCH TREATIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE SECOND IS THE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF TREATY MEMBERSHIP-THAT IS, THE ANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES FOR AMONG OTHER THINGS, FOREIGN AID AND INVESTMENT, TRADE, AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL SUPPORT. COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES ARISE WHEN DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL ACTORS PREMISE THEIR ACTIONS TOWARD A STATE ON THE STATE'S DECISION TO ACCEPT OR REJECT INTERNATIONAL LEGAL RULES. AS I DEMONSTRATE USING BOTH NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND REANALYSIS OF EARLIER STUDIES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATIES AND STATE BEHAVIOR HINGES SIGNIFICANTLY ON THESE TWO FACTORS. THE ARTICLE THUS OFFERS A VISION OF THE POTENTIAL AND THE LIMITS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT INTEGRATES AND MOVES BEYOND EXISTING ACCOUNTS.
186	THE ARTICLE PROVES THE NECESSITY OF INVOLVING THE PERSONS ASSISTING THE PARTIES AND THE COURT INTO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THE PROMOTION OF JUSTICE AS AN INDEPENDENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE FUNCTION UNDER CHAPTER 8 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT BY BOTH THE PARTICIPANTS OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND BY OTHER SUBJECTS OF CRIMINAL LAW RELATIONS WHO DO NOT HAVE AN INDEPENDENT PROCEDURAL STATUS. THE CONDUCTED SOCIAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO STATE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN A CORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE MODERN SOCIETY, ITS DEVELOPMENT TRENDS, AND THE NECESSITY OF ACQUIRING DUE LEGAL AWARENESS. THE UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL AWARENESS VARIED THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE BUT WHAT REMAINED UNCHANGED WERE THE IDEAS THAT IT CAN BE INFLUENCED AND THAT IT DETERMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ITSELF. CITIZENS WITH THE DUE LEVEL OF LEGAL AWARENESS ARE READY TO PROMOTE JUSTICE, WHICH TESTIFIES TO THEIR HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, A DESIRE TO BE INVOLVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK, TO BRING JUSTICE AND ENSURE LEGALITY OF PROCEDURAL DECISIONS. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN RUSSIA REQUIRE FACILITATION, BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO PROVIDE IT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, WHICH PROVES THE NEED FOR A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PROMOTING JUSTICE IN THE MODERN RUSSIAN CRIMINAL PROCESS. THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH STRESSES THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL INADEQUACY OF THE THREE-PART SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE FUNCTIONS ENSHRINED IN THE CURRENT RUSSIAN CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE POSSIBILITY OF SINGLING OUT THE PROMOTION OF JUSTICE AS AN INDEPENDENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE INSTITUTE NECESSARY FOR MAKING LAWFUL, WELL-GROUNDED AND COMPREHENSIVE PROCEDURAL DECISIONS BY OFFICIALS AND STATE BODIES. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE CHANGES IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATIONS WHICH WILL FORESEE THE POSSIBILITY OF RENAMING CHAPTER 8 OF THE CODE. BESIDES, HAVING ANALYZED THE CONCEPT OF "JUSTICE", THE AUTHOR PRESENTS HIS POSITION OF WHAT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE PROMOTION OF JUSTICE.
187	RECENT PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THAT: YOUNG PEOPLE IN BULGARIA KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE PRE-1989 PERIOD; HALF OF THE PEOPLE CONSIDER THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT AFTER 1989 TO HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. DESPITE REACHING SOME MAJOR GOALS LIKE RESTORING PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, BEING FREE TO TRAVEL ABROAD, AND ACCESSING THE EU, DISTRUST OF INSTITUTIONS IS SHOWN TO BE RUNNING HIGH AMONG THE BULGARIAN PUBLIC. FROM AMONG NINE FORMER EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES WHERE NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS TRANSITION -RELATED PROCESSES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED, THE PERCENTAGE OF BULGARIANS DISPLEASED WITH THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST. ACCORDING TO NATIONAL STATISTICS, ONE IN FIVE BULGARIANS LIVES ON 60 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL MEDIUM INCOME, AND ONE IN TEN BULGARIANS GRAPPLES WITH UTTER POVERTY. AMONG THE PEOPLE PAYING THE PRICE FOR CHANGE HAVE BEEN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS, RETIREES, AND RESIDENTS OF PERIPHERAL AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. WITH THE VAST NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DEPRIVED OF JOBS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BULGARIANS HAVE CHOSEN EMIGRATION AS A WAY OUT OF THE PREDICAMENT. EMIGRATION AND PLUMMETING BIRTH RATES HAVE LED TO DEMOGRAPHIC COLLAPSE. RESEARCHERS SEE BULGARIAN POST-1989 CAPITALISM AS CHARACTERIZED BY POVERTY, INCOMPETENT AND CORRUPT STATE ADMINISTRATION, DEPENDENCE ON INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND A WEAK CIVIL SOCIETY. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS HAS BEEN THE NEGATIVE CHANGES IN THE SPHERE OF MORALITY. MORAL NORMS DO NOT SEEM TO BE OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. ADDED TO THAT IS MASS PESSIMISM AND A CONTINUOUS TREND OF PEOPLE FEELING UNHAPPY AND DISPLEASED WITH THEIR LIVES. SEEKING THE REASONS BEHIND THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRANSITION, OBSERVERS POINT TO PASSIVENESS, COLLECTIVISM, AND EGALITARIANISM OF PEOPLE IN POST-COMMUNIST SOCIETIES. THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION HAS ALSO BEEN LOOKED UPON THROUGH THE PRISM OF MEMORY AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. ADDING TO THE INTERNAL PECULIARITIES OF THE BULGARIAN TRANSITION THE EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL INFLUENCES SUCH AS ECONOMIC AND MIGRATION CRISES, IT IS NOT EASY TO FORMULATE EFFECTIVE STEPS FOR DEALING WITH THE CAUSES OF DISILLUSIONMENT. ONE THING IS CLEAR, HOWEVER. SUCCESS IS NOT GOING TO BE REACHED UNLESS A STOP IS PUT TO THE ABUSE OF POWER AND THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ENSURED.
188	ENSURING THAT PUBLIC SERVICE COMPLAINTS ARE HANDLED EFFECTIVELY AND RIGHTS OF REDRESS UPHELD IS AN INTEGRAL FEATURE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND EFFECTIVE SERVICE DELIVERY. A REVIEW OF THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE AND A NUMBER OF KEY GOVERNMENT REPORTS REVEALS WHAT CITIZEN COMPLAINT AND REDRESS SYSTEMS EXIST CURRENTLY, HOW THEY CAN BE DESIGNED AND ENABLED TO OPERATE WITH THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT, AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT IN HOLDING PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE USE OF DISCRETIONARY DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT (NPM) AND PUBLIC SECTOR REFORMS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, A CONSUMERIST MODEL FOR HANDLING COMPLAINTS HAS COME INCREASINGLY TO THE FORE. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE TRADITIONAL CITIZENSHIP PERSPECTIVE, THIS WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING COMPLAINTS HANDLING AND REDRESS. HOWEVER, THE CONSUMERIST MODEL'S NARROW FOCUS ON CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND THE RISK OF WEAKENING CITIZENSHIP VALUES SUCH AS FAIRNESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE SUGGEST A CAUTIOUS APPROACH MAY BE BEST. PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS NEED AN AWARENESS OF HOW PUBLIC REFORM STRATEGIES ORIENTED EXCLUSIVELY TOWARDS A STRENGTHENED CONSUMER ROLE DO RISK UNDERMINING IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE COMPLAINTS HANDLING AND REDRESS STRATEGIES EMBEDDED IN THE 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'DUE PROCESS' FEATURES OF CITIZEN-ORIENTED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. ACCOUNTABILITY MAY BE WEAKENED WHEN SERVICE RECIPIENTS ARE DEFINED LESS IN TERMS OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP AND MORE ON THE BASIS OF A NARROWLY DEFINED STATUS AS A MARKETPLACE CONSUMER. THIS IS A KEY IMPLICATION OF CURRENT TRENDS BY GOVERNMENTS TO RELY INCREASINGLY ON PRIVATIZATION, CONTRACTING-OUT AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO DELIVER SERVICES. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS HOW WELL SERVICE COMPLAINTS ARE HANDLED IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF QUALITY IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES AT BOTH SYSTEMIC AND SERVICE-RECIPIENT LEVELS. PROCEDURES THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE, SIMPLE TO INVOKE AND OPERATE, TRANSPARENT, ENSURE STAKEHOLDERS ARE KEPT INFORMED, AND SENSITIVE TO DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE IN COMPLAINTS HANDLING AND REDRESS PROCESSES. HOWEVER, AS MORE PUBLIC SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY QUASI-PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS USING CONTRACTING AND SUBCONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS, THE CHALLENGE FACING PRACTITIONERS IS HOW TO ENSURE THAT CITIZEN-CENTRIC VALUES ARE MAINTAINED EVEN AS EXTERNAL REVIEW AGENCIES LIKE THE OMBUDSMAN AND TRADITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY PROMOTING PROCEDURES ARE REPLACED BY NARROWER CONSUMERIST-ORIENTED APPROACHES.
189	THE SUBJECT OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE ARTICLE IS THE SPECIFICITY OF THE FORMATION OF THE SIBERIAN CONCEPT SPHERE ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE CONCEPT "EXILE" THAT IS CONSIDERED AS A PHENOMENON OF THE SIBERIAN LINGUACULTURE MANIFESTED AT THE COMMUNICATIVE LEVEL. THE MAIN BODY OF TEXTS FOR ANALYSIS WERE ORAL STORIES OF RUSSIAN OLD-TIMERS, SPEAKERS OF THE MIDDLE OB DIALECT, ABOUT THE PERIOD OF "PEASANT" EXILE (1930S-1950S). TEXTS OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, FRAGMENTS OF POETIC TEXTS WERE USED FOR COMPARISON. THE CONCEPT "EXILE" OCCUPIES A SIGNIFICANT PLACE IN THE SIBERIAN LINGUACULTURE. IT IS CHARACTERISED BY TEMPORAL LENGTH, REGIONALITY, SOCIAL AND EVALUATIVE MEANINGS; IT HAS COMMUNICATIVE MARKERS. IN SIBERIAN DISCOURSE, THE CONCEPT IS VERBALISED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF LEXICAL UNITS BELONGING TO DIFFERENT LEXICAL SEMANTIC GROUPS. FOR INSTANCE, THE SIBERIANS USE DIFFERENT NAMES FOR EXILED PEOPLE (POSELENETS [SETTLER], SPETSPERESELENETS [SPECIAL SETTLER], POSEL'GA (DIALECTAL) [SETTLER], POLITSSYL'NYY [POLITICAL EXILE], ETC.). THE MAIN SPEECH GENRES OF ORAL COMMUNICATION, IN WHICH THE CONCEPT "EXILE" IS REPRESENTED, ARE RECOLLECTION AND AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NARRATIVE. THE MENTAL STRUCTURE OF THE CONCEPT VARIES IN DIFFERENT DISCURSIVE PRACTICES. IN PERSONALITY-ORIENTED DISCOURSE, PROCEDURAL SIGNS ARE ACTUALISED IN THE SPEECH OF THE EXILES; IN THE SPEECH OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, PERCEPTION AND EVALUATION ARE IN THE COMMUNICATIVE FOCUS; IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS, THE ACTIVITY AND EVALUATION COMPONENTS ARE REPRESENTED BASED ON RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. EVALUATION IS ACTUALISED IN ALL TYPES OF TEXTS, BUT DIFFERS BY AUTHORS DEPENDING ON THE VALUE SYSTEM THAT ONE CONSIDERS TRUE. THE VALUE DOMINANTS OF COMMUNICANTS LIE IN THE ETHICAL AND SOCIAL SPHERES, AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTUALISATION OF THE MEANINGS OF JUSTICE - INJUSTICE, GOOD - EVIL, PUNISHMENT - CRIME, MAN - POWER, AND OTHERS. THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE VALUES OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS LEADS TO A MISMATCH OF DISCURSIVE LINGUISTIC PICTURES OF THE WORLD. THE LINGUOCULTUROLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF THE CONCEPT "EXILE" IS MANIFESTED IN ITS ABILITY TO FORM THE FIGURATIVE POOL OF THE LANGUAGE, TO ENTER THE SMALL GENRES OF SIBERIAN FOLKLORE, TO RECEIVE LITERARY EXPRESSION IN THE WORKS OF SIBERIAN WRITERS AND POETS WHO WERE PARTICIPANTS AND WITNESSES OF THE DRAMATIC PERIOD OF RUSSIAN HISTORY.
190	THE CREATION OF THE IRAQI SPECIAL TRIBUNAL IN DECEMBER 2003 BY IRAQI AUTHORITIES WHO WERE AT THE TIME UNDER THE LEGAL OCCUPATION OF THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY MARKED THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW FORM OF INTERNATIONALIZED DOMESTIC TRIBUNALS. THE IRAQIS SUCCEEDED IN INCORPORATING THE FULL RANGE OF MODERN CRIMES INTO THEIR DOMESTIC CODES ALONGSIDE SOME CAREFULLY SELECTED DOMESTIC OFFENSES, WHILE AMENDING DOMESTIC PROCEDURAL LAW IN SOME KEY WAYS TO ALIGN THE PROCESS WITH ESTABLISHED INTERNATIONAL LAW RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF FULL AND FAIR TRIALS. THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATIONS AND THE BEGINNING OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS GENERATED MAJOR DEBATES ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF SUCH A DOMESTIC FORUM WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND THE LAW OF OCCUPATION. IN PARTICULAR, THERE WAS A MAJOR STRAND OF THOUGHT FROM OUTSIDE IRAQ THAT THE MOST LEGITIMATE AND APPROPRIATE FORUM WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INTERNATIONAL PROCESS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED NATIONS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE IRAQIS WHO DEMANDED A DOMESTIC PROCESS BASED ON THEIR INQUISITORIAL MODEL, SETTING THEM IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE EMERGING TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW. THROUGH A DETAILED AND UNIQUE ANALYSIS OF THE PROVISIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND UNDERLYING IRAQI PROCEDURAL LAW, IT CRITICIZES THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY SOME THAT ASSUME THE ILLEGITIMACY OF THE TRIBUNAL UNDER ESTABLISHED INTERNATIONAL NORMS. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES THE MOST DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE LAW OF OCCUPATION AS IT EMERGED FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TRIBUNAL AS AN INDEPENDENT COURT, AND ITS SUBSEQUENT VALIDATION BY SOVEREIGN IRAQI DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES, WAS COMPLETELY VALID AND PROPER. THE OVERARCHING THEME OF THE ARTICLE IS THAT THE IMPOSITION OF ARTIFICIAL STANDARDS AND THE COMPLETE REVOCATION OF THE PREEXISTING IRAQI JUDICIAL STRUCTURES WOULD HAVE CREATED A PROCESS DEEMED WHOLLY ILLEGITIMATE BY THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND JUDICIARY THAT WOULD HAVE UNDERMINED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN IRAQ. THE AUTHOR'S PERSONAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE JUDGES SERVE TO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRIBUNAL IS CAPABLE OF SERVING AS THE DOORWAY THROUGH WHICH THE DETAILED BODY OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW IS INTRODUCED TO THE BROADER ARABIC SPEAKING WORLD.
191	THE ISRAELI RADICAL JUDICIAL OVERHAUL PROGRAM, AIMING TO SERIOUSLY WEAKEN THE JUDICIARY, HAS LED THE COUNTRY TO THE BRINK OF CHAOS AND VIOLENCE, WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEMONSTRATORS IN THE STREETS, SOCIETY TEARING ITSELF APART AND NUMEROUS SECTORS OF SOCIETY, SUCH AS MEDICAL SERVICE OR RESERVISTS OF IDF, ANNOUNCING A SUSPENSION OF THEIR SERVICE TO A NATION THEY FEAR WILL NO LONGER BE A DEMOCRACY. DESPITE THE STRONG SOCIAL PROTEST, KNESSET - REPRESENTING AN EXTREMELY RIGHT-WING COALITION - ADOPTED ON THE JULY 24, 2023 THE AMENDMENT TO BASIC LAW: THE JUDICIARY TO BAR THE JUDICIARY FROM STRIKING DOWN DECISIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS MINISTERS ON THE GROUNDS OF SUCH DECISIONS BEING UNREASONABLE. THE MEASURE KNOWN AS THE REASONABLENESS CLAUSE (STANDARD) IS ROOTED IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN CASE LAW AND IT IS FREQUENTLY USED IN ISRAEL TO CONTROL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY. IT ALLOWS THE COURTS TO STRIKE DOWN GOVERNMENTAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS AND THEIR REGULATIONS SEEN AS HAVING NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS OF A PARTICULAR ISSUE, OR NOT GIVEN THE CORRECT WEIGHT TO THOSE CONSIDERATIONS - EVEN IF THEY DO NOT VIOLATE ANY PARTICULAR LAW OR ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS. THE CURRENT RIGHT-WING COALITION, LED BY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ARGUES THAT THE CLAUSE AS IT STANDS GIVES TOO MUCH POWER TO THE JUDICIARY, ESPECIALLY THE SUPREME COURT SITTING AS A HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, TO INTERFERE WITH THE ACTIONS OF THE EXECUTIVE, AND THAT THE POWERS OF JUDGES, WHO ARE NOT ELECTED BY THE PUBLIC, REMAIN OUT OF CONTROL IN THIS PROCEDURE. OPPONENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AMENDMENT ARGUE THAT THIS STANDARD IS CRUCIAL IN HELPING TO PROTECT CIVIL RIGHTS THAT ARE NOT FULLY DEFINED IN ISRAELI LAW. ELIMINATING THE STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS WILL BE ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS GIVING THE GOVERNMENT UNLIMITED POWER. IT VIOLATES NOT ONLY THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE AND THE RULE OF LAW BUT IT ALSO HARMS THE RIGHT TO GOOD ADMINISTRATION. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AMENDMENT, THE STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF THE ISRAELI SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE.
192	REPORT. THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A LEGAL PHENOMENON THAT CONSTANTLY ATTRACTS THE ATTENTION OF RESEARCHERS. IT IS CONSIDERED IN LEGAL SCIENCE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ITS ORIGIN, LEGAL FORMALIZATION, CONTENT AND MEANING. THE INTEREST IN THIS PROBLEM IS CAUSED, ON THE ONE HAND, BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THIS PRESUMPTION, AND, ON THE OTHER, BY ITS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE NOT ONLY FOR SOCIETY AND THE STATE, BUT, FIRST OF ALL, FOR A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL. THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS USUALLY CONSIDERED BY SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, SINCE, IN THEIR OPINION, IT BELONGS TO THE CRIMINAL SPHERE, THE SPHERE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS, EVIDENCE. MEANWHILE, SUCH A VIEW OF THE PROBLEM, IT SEEMS, LIMITS THE TRUE ESSENCE OF THE PHENOMENON AND REDUCES ITS SIGNIFICANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY. IN THIS WORK, GENERAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRIVATE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH METH-ODS WERE USED, SUCH AS ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, ABSTRACTION, AND THE CASE METHOD. THE RESULTS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH. AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHOR COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE. THE CONSTITU-TIONAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON IS INHERENT IN ITS NATURE, SOURCES, CONTENT, MEANING. CONCLUSIONS. THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE. CONSIDERING IT EXCLU-SIVELY THROUGH THE PRISM OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, AS AN ELEMENT OF JUDICIAL PRO-CEEDINGS RELATED TO THE THEORY OF EVIDENCE AND THE ADVERSARIAL NATURE OF THE PARTIES, GREATLY LIMITS ITS ROLE AND SIGNIFICANCE, LEADS TO TOO NARROW AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS CONTENT. THE PRE-SUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS A LEGAL PHENOMENON THAT AFFECTS VARIOUS SOCIAL RELATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, TO ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, TO TAX RELATIONS, ETC. AS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE, THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE INTERACTS WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES: THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE SOCIAL STATE, THE DEMOCRATIC STATE, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, JUSTICE, LEGALITY, ETC. THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE EXPRESSES THE BALANCE OF THE PUB-LIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS OF A STATE-ORGANIZED SOCIETY. THE EXISTENCE OF THIS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PHENOMENON SHOWS THE VALUE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM.
193	THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS OF THE CRISIS OF VALUES, IDEAS, PRINCIPLES OF THE LIBERALISM THAT UNDERLIE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY. IT IS SHOWN THAT LIBERALISM AND POLITICAL DEMOCRACY THEMSELVES REPRESENT ANSWERS TO THE CHALLENGES CREATED BY THE TRANSITION OF COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES OF THE WEST FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE NEW TIME IN THE 16TH-18TH CENTURIES. BEING ORIENTED TOWARD A RADICAL BREAK WITH THE PAST, THEY LAID IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL FOUNDATION FOR THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION, IN THE PROCESS OF WHICH THE NEW CAPITALIST RATIONALISTIC CIVILIZATION BASED ON SUCH VALUES AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, MARKET ECONOMY AND RULE OF LAW REPLACED FORMS OF THE MEDIEVAL STATE SYSTEM. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THEY ORIGINATED IN A RELATIVELY NARROW GROUP OF PEOPLES OF THE EURO-ATLANTIC WORLD AND PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN THEIR ECONOMIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL PROGRESS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE THESIS IS PUT FORWARD THAT LIBERALISM AND DEMOCRACY BEING HISTORICAL PHENOMENA ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF ORIGIN, TRIUMPH, GRADUAL DECLINE NATURAL FOR HUMAN COMMUNITIES. ITS VALIDITY IS EVIDENCED BY THE TENDENCIES AND PROCESSES THAT LIBERALISM AND POLITICAL DEMOCRACY HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST TWO-THREE DECADES WHEN THEY REACHED THE HIGHEST LIMIT OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, AND IN THE EYES OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE WEST ACQUIRED THE STATUS OF THE ULTIMATE TRUTH. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO ABSOLUTIZATION AND EMASCULATION OF THE VALUES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AS WELL AS OF OTHER RELATED IDEAS AND ATTITUDES, AS UNDERSTOOD BY FOUNDING FATHERS OF LIBERALISM AND GREAT REFORMERS OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THE MAIN FOCUS IS ON SUBSTANTIATING THE THESIS ABOUT POSSIBLE COMPLETION OF THE LIBERAL ORDER DOMINATION ERA IN THE STATES OF THE EURO-ATLANTIC REGION AT THE COUNTRY AND GLOBAL LEVEL. ON THAT GROUND, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT WE ARE WITNESSING THE ONSET OF A NEW ERA CHARACTERIZED BY TECTONIC SHIFTS IN THE EXISTENTIAL BASIS OF LIFE WITH GLOBAL REACH, AN EXISTENTIAL SHIFT THAT IS EQUALLY LARGE, PERHAPS EVEN SUPERIOR IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION THAT THE WESTERN WORLD SURVIVED WITH THE TRANSITION FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE NEW TIME.
194	THE NORTH BRAZIL SHELF IS A LARGE MARINE ECOSYSTEM (LME) THAT EXTENDS FROM THE CARIBBEAN SEA, IN CENTRAL AMERICA, TO THE PARNAIBA RIVER IN BRAZIL, AND INCLUDES SIX COUNTRIES. THE AREA IS DOMINATED BY THE RUNOFF OF LARGE RIVERS, INCLUDING THE AMAZON AND ORINOCO, AND BY THE INTENSE DISTURBANCE OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT, TIDES AND CURRENTS. THE SEA BED IS FORMED MAINLY BY MUD IN SHALLOW WATER, AND BY SAND, MUD, AND GRAVEL IN DEEPER WATER. IN TERMS OF ITS BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY, THIS LME CAN BE CONSIDERED OLIGOTROPHIC, WITH STRATIFIED HABITATS. THE MAIN SOURCE OF NUTRIENTS OF THE EUPHOTIC LAYER IS THE LOCAL RIVERS AND MANGROVES. PRIMARY PRODUCTION HAS BEEN LIMITED BY LIGHT AND RISING TEMPERATURES IN RECENT YEARS, FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN MARINE PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY. HOWEVER, THE BENTHIC FAUNA IS VERY RICH AND UNIQUE, BUT POORLY KNOWN. MORE THAN 500 FISH SPECIES HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THIS LME. DEMERSAL FISH AND SHRIMP ARE THE MAIN FISHERY RESOURCES IN COASTAL AND CONTINENTAL SHELF WATERS. FISHERIES ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 600 MILLION USD A YEAR WITH A CONSIDERABLE DIVERSITY OF METHODS AND SCALES RANGING FROM VERY SMALL TO INDUSTRIAL. SEAFOOD CONSUMPTION IS MODERATE TO HIGH IN THE LOCAL COUNTRIES. CLIMATE CHANGES, DAM BUILDING, DEFORESTATION, POLLUTION, OVERFISHING, TOURISM AND AQUACULTURE ARE THE MAIN THREATS TO ECOSYSTEM PRODUCTIVITY AND HABITAT QUALITY. SOCIOECONOMIC DATA ARE SCANT FOR THIS LME. DEVELOPMENT IS CONCENTRATED NEAR THE CITIES AND MOUTHS OF RIVERS. TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES IN THE COASTAL AREAS ARE CULTURALLY DIVERSE, BUT INVARIABLY CHARACTERIZED BY VERY LOW SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF THE LOCAL COUNTRIES RANGES FROM 7,500 USD PER CAPITA IN GUYANA TO 32,600 USD PER CAPITA IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO. PROFOUND PROBLEMS OF GOVERNABILITY ARE COMMON TO ALL SIX COUNTRIES, AND MEAN GOVERNANCE INDICATORS REFLECT POOR PERFORMANCES IN ALL CASES. THE MAIN ISSUES ARE AN ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL STABILITY, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. FISHERIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY INCREASING EFFORT AND AN ABSENCE OF SUSTAINABILITY. MOST OF THE FISHERY STOCKS ARE EITHER FULLY OR OVER EXPLOITED. THIS SCENARIO CAN ONLY BE RECTIFIED BY INVESTMENTS IN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, AS WELL AS THE INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF FISHERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND REGULATIONS.
195	PURPOSEGROWING SOCIAL CONCERNS AND ECOLOGICAL ISSUES ACCELERATE FIRMS' ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) ENGAGEMENT. HENCE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO ADVANCE THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY FOCUSING ON THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL AND FIRM GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS FOR GREATER ESG ENGAGEMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE WHETHER PUBLIC GOVERNANCE STIMULATES EXCESSIVE ESG ENGAGEMENT AND WHETHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODERATES THIS RELATIONSHIP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHUSING A SAMPLE OF 43,803 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS AFFILIATED WITH 41 COUNTRIES AND 9 INDUSTRIES, THE AUTHORS ADOPT A COUNTRY, INDUSTRY AND YEAR FIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION ANALYSIS. FINDINGSTHE AUTHORS FIND THAT PUBLIC GOVERNANCE STRENGTH VIA ITS SIX DIMENSIONS STIMULATES EXCESSIVE ESG ENGAGEMENT. THIS IMPLIES THAT FIRMS IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE MORE MOTIVATED FOR ESG ENGAGEMENT. FURTHERMORE, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NEGATIVELY MODERATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL PUBLIC GOVERNANCE DIMENSIONS (EXCEPT POLITICAL STABILITY) AND EXCESSIVE ESG ENGAGEMENT. THIS IMPLIES THAT PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ARE SUBSTITUTES FOR ENCOURAGING FIRMS TO COMMIT TO ESG. FURTHER TESTS REVEAL THAT WHEREAS THESE RESULTS IN THE BASELINE ANALYSES ARE VALID FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, THEY ARE NOT VALID IN EMERGING MARKETS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONSTHE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL AND AGENCY THEORIES. IN COUNTRIES WITH STRONG (WEAK) INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS, CORPORATE GOVERNANCE BECOMES WEAK (STRONG) IN INCITING GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE MECHANISM ALLEVIATES AGENCY COSTS, RENDERING INTERNAL MECHANISMS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NONCOMPULSORY FOR ESG ENGAGEMENT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSTHE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EMERGING COUNTRIES NEED TO REINFORCE THEIR INSTITUTIONS FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY, REGULATORY QUALITY AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, WHICH WILL HAVE A DOMINO EFFECT ON FIRMS IN ADDRESSING STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS. THE RESULTS ALSO ADVISE EMERGING COUNTRY FIRMS TO AUGMENT THEIR INTERNAL MONITORING MECHANISMS FOR GREATER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, SUCH AS STRUCTURING BOARDS AND ESTABLISHING CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MECHANISMS, COMMITTEES AND POLICIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUETHIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE RECENT LITERATURE INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS IN EXCESSIVE ESG ENGAGEMENT. THE STUDY ALSO EXPLORES WHETHER PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER ESG INVOLVEMENT AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SIX INDICATORS OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE QUALITY AND EXCESSIVE ESG PRACTICES IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING ECONOMIES.
196	PURPOSE IT IS RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE THAT AN OMBUDSMAN SYSTEM MAKES THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE PROVISIONS OF THE OMBUDSMAN ACT 1980, AS WELL AS THE POSITION, ROLE AND NECESSITY OF THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN BANGLADESH. IT ALSO EVALUATES HOW THE OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION CAN ACT AS A GATEWAY FOR CITIZENS OF BANGLADESH TO RESOLVE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE MALADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE COUNTRY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE STUDY IS BASICALLY QUALITATIVE IN NATURE WHERE BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES HAVE BEEN USED. AS WELL, A COMBINATION OF ANALYTICAL METHODS AND CURRENT LEGISLATIVE METHODS, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE LEGISLATIVE TECHNIQUES, WAS USED IN THE STUDY. FINDINGS THIS STUDY FINDS THAT THE OMBUDSMAN IS A VITAL INSTITUTION FOR BANGLADESH TO ELIMINATE MALADMINISTRATION, NEPOTISM AND ABUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WELL AS ABUSE OF THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. GOING FORWARD, BANGLADESH NEEDS TO AMEND THE EXISTING OMBUDSMAN ACT 1980 AND THEN TAKE PROPER STEPS TO FIRMLY ESTABLISH THE OMBUDSMAN OFFICE TO ENSURE AND INCREASE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE, OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE MAIN IMPLICATION OF THIS STUDY IS THAT IT WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN BANGLADESH. THIS STUDY WILL MAKE ITS READERS AND PARTICULARLY THE CITIZENS OF BANGLADESH AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN BANGLADESH AND THE EXISTING LOOPHOLES IN THE CURRENT OMBUDSMAN ACT 1980. THIS RESEARCH ALSO PROVIDES A NEW AVENUE FOR SCHOLARS TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM TOWARD NATION-BUILDING BY FURTHER RESEARCHING THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN IN BANGLADESH. IN THIS WAY, SCHOLARS IN THIS FIELD CAN SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES OF THE ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN TO A WIDER AUDIENCE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE STUDY WILL FACILITATE POLICYMAKERS AND THE GOVERNMENT TO ENACT AN EFFECTIVE NEW LAW OR TO AMEND THE EXISTING LAW RELATING TO THE OMBUDSMAN. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER SETS OUT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE OMBUDSMAN ACT 1980. HENCE, IT WILL BE OF INTEREST TO POLICYMAKERS, GOVERNMENT, ORGANIZATIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND THOSE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT TAKEN STEPS TOWARD FORMING AN OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION.
197	THIS ARTICLE CRITICIZES A RECENT MOVEMENT TOWARD MAKING STATUTORY INTERPRETATION SIMPLER AND MORE UNIFORM. THE TREND IS REFLECTED BY PROPOSALS TO ADOPT CODIFIED RULES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, GIVE STARE DECISIS EFFECT TO INTERPRETIVE METHODOLOGY, USE SIMPLER METHODS OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IN LOWER COURTS, AND IMPLEMENT CERTAIN VERSIONS OF TEXTUALISM. THIS ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT SUCH PROPOSALS ARE DRIVEN BY AN OVERARCHING DESIRE TO LIMIT JUDICIAL DISCRETION AND PROMOTE A FORMAL VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW; THEY ASSUME THAT THE TRADITIONAL HIERARCHY OF LEGAL SOURCES IS EXCLUSIVE, AND THAT STATUTORY INTERPRETATION'S FUNCTION IS TO ASCERTAIN THE MEANING OF THE LAW. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES EACH OF THESE GOALS OR ASSUMPTIONS BY CLAIMING, FIRST, THAT INSTEAD OF SEEKING TO ELIMINATE JUDICIAL DISCRETION, THE PRIMARY GOAL OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION METHODOLOGY SHOULD BE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF DOMINATION BY THE STATE. SECOND, THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES REGARDING THE PERMISSIBLE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY IN DIFFICULT STATUTORY CASES REQUIRES THE USE OF PRACTICAL REASONING, AND THE QUALITY OF STATUTORY LAW AND ITS DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY BENEFIT FROM A BROAD RANGE OF ARGUMENTS AND DIVERSE JUDICIAL PERSPECTIVES. THIRD, THE TRADITIONAL HIERARCHY OF LEGAL SOURCES IS OUTDATED, AND "INTERPRETIVE METHODOLOGY" AND "AGENCY DECISION-MAKING" SHOULD BE VIEWED AS DISTINCT FORMS OF LAW THAT MERIT THEIR OWN SPECIAL PLACES IN A NEW LEGAL HIERARCHY FOR THE REGULATORY STATE. FINALLY, THE CENTRAL FUNCTION OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION BY FEDERAL COURTS IN THE MODERN REGULATORY STATE IS TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTEST THE VALIDITY OF PARTICULAR EXERCISES OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY, RATHER THAN TO ASCERTAIN THE MEANING OF THE LAW IN A VACUUM. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE ARGUES THAT THE RECENT PROPOSALS TO DUMB DOWN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION ARE FUNDAMENTALLY MISGUIDED, AND IT CLOSES BY MAKING SEVERAL RELATED OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH INTERPRETIVE METHODOLOGY CAN OR SHOULD BE SIMPLE OR UNIFORM. IN SUM, PROVISIONAL DIALOGUES BY AND AMONG DIFFERENT CENTERS OF POWER BETTER REFLECT THE NATURE OF LAW IN THE MODERN REGULATORY STATE THAN ARTIFICIAL EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE SIMPLE, PREDICTABLE, OR UNIFORM FINAL ANSWERS TO OUR MOST PRESSING LEGAL OR SOCIAL PROBLEMS.
198	THE INFLUENCE OF BROADCAST AND PRINT MEDIA ON A PERSON'S REPUTATION BY INSTILLING A WIDESPREAD SENSE OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE BEFORE, OR AFTER A COURT OF LAW JUDGMENT WAS REFERRED TO AS A "TRIAL BY MEDIA" IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. THIS TERM WAS COINED IN THE EARLY DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE ORDINARY GUY HAS BEEN ACCELERATED BY THE MEDIA, WHICH HAS GIVEN THEM A VOICE. WHEN A SIGNIFICANT SUBJECT IS PRESENTED BEFORE EVEN THE COURT, THE PUBLIC IS LIKELY TO BECOME MORE INTERESTED. THE PUBLIC IS CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR INTERESTING NEWS, SO THE MEDIA, INCLUDING PUBLICATIONS, BROADCAST NETWORKS, AND NEWS WEBSITES, KEEP PUBLISHING THEIR ACCOUNTS OF HISTORY. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IS A LEGAL PRACTICE IN INDIA. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS EXAMPLES IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE MEDIA JUDGED A PERPETRATOR'S TRIAL AND GAVE A VERDICT IN FRONT OF THE COURT. THE SUPREME COURT STATED THAT JOURNALISM AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SEPARATE BODIES WITH SEPARATE DUTIES THAT DO NOT OVERLAP. ONE COULD NEVER, AND HENCE CANNOT, RELY ON THE OTHER TO FULFILL HIS OR HER RESPONSIBILITIES. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE JOURNALIST SHOULD STICK TO THEIR PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM RATHER THAN OPERATING AS A SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATION FOR THE COURT. THIS RESEARCH REVEALS HOW THE BIASED CHARACTER OF SOME MEDIA COVERAGE RENDERS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION A BARRIER TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS NECESSARY TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHT OF THE VICTIM TO A FAIR TRIAL AND THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. AS A RESULT, THE MEDIA POSSESSES GREAT POWER THAT CAN SUBTLY INFLUENCE A CASE. THE ISSUE IS NOT WITH THE MEDIA UNCOVERING SOCIETAL WRONGDOINGS. THE ISSUE OCCURS WHEN THEY EXCEED THE PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO THEM AND DO ACTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT. THE FINE LINE BETWEEN "INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY" AND "GUILT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT" IS READILY CROSSED, JEOPARDIZING A TRIAL. TO AVOID MEDIA TRIALS ERODING PEOPLE'S CIVIL RIGHTS, STEPS MUST BE TAKEN, SUCH AS PROVIDING A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE MEDIA'S DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND EMPOWERING COURTS TO PUNISH THOSE WHO BLATANT DISOBEY THEM.
199	RECENT REPORTS BY THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (2018 AND 2019) HAVE REVEALED THAT WORLD'S HUMAN ACTIVITIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AROUND 1 DEGREES C OF GLOBAL WARMING ABOVE THE PRE-INDUSTRIAL LEVELS (EXPECTED TO REACH 1.5 DEGREES C BETWEEN 2030 AND 2052) WITH THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUEL CONTRIBUTING TO OVER THREE-QUARTERS OF WORLD'S EMISSIONS. RISING DEMAND FOR ENERGY IS EXPECTED TO ADD ANOTHER 39 BILLION TONNES OF CARBON-DIOXIDE, THREATENING THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN OF ACHIEVING NET-ZERO BY 2050. GIVEN THE EXPECTED WORSENING OF EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS' BURNING, THIS PAPER'S MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THE SUPPLY-SIDE EFFECT OF ENERGY GENERATION FROM FOSSIL FUELS (COAL, NATURAL GAS AND OIL) ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. IN DOING SO, AN EXTENDED STOCHASTIC IMPACTS BY REGRESSION ON POPULATION AFFLUENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (STIRPAT) MODEL IS ADOPTED THAT CONTROLS FOR A RANGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS. THE PANEL DATA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE IS APPLIED TO THE MODEL THAT INCLUDES A BALANCED PANEL OF 59 COUNTRIES USING COAL, 77 COUNTRIES USING GAS AND 96 COUNTRIES USING OIL FOR 2002 TO 2016. THE RESULTS REVEALED COEFFICIENT COAL IS NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT THE 1 PER CENT LEVEL (ALPHA = -0.052 WITH RHO = 0.01) AND OIL IS NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT 5 PER CENT LEVEL (ALPHA = -0.020 WITH RHO = 0.05). THESE RESULTS SUPPORT SUPPLY-SIDE ENERGY GENERATION THROUGH THE BURNING OF COAL AND OIL AS VITAL CONTRIBUTORS TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DEGRADATION. OTHER THAN CONFIRMING THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) EFFECT, FOREST COVER, SCHOOLING, THE RULE OF LAW AND NATIONS COMMITMENTS TO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES ARE OTHER STRONG CORRELATES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE. THE FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED STRONG ADVERSE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL INTENSIFICATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THE URGENCY FOR THE WORLDS FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY-DEPENDENT COUNTRIES TO TRANSIT FROM FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY TO THE PRODUCTION OF FRONTIER RENEWABLE (CLEANER FORMS) SOURCES OF ENERGY TO MINIMISE DEGRADATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. OTHER THAN EXPLORING SUPPLY-SIDE CARBON MITIGATION POLICIES, THERE IS A NEED FOR ACTIVE CO-OPERATION OF ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES TO MINIMISE FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.

200	THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AS A MEANS OF PREVENTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ITS UNDERSTANDING AS AN INTEGRAL LEGAL PHENOMENON, INCLUDING THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT AND MEANING OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, LEGAL NORMS THAT ENSHRINE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EVOLUTION OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENON OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN GENERAL AND LEGAL IN PARTICULAR.THE CHARACTERISTIC SIGNS OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ARE REVEALED AND INTERRELATIONS WITH ITS SEPARATE TYPE, NAMELY LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, ARE ESTABLISHED.THE DERIVATIVE OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM SOCIAL IS SHOWN, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE OF ALL ITS MANIFESTATIONS AND TYPES IS AIMED AT PREVENTING DEVIANT BEHAVIOR. ARGUMENTS ARE PRESENTED PROVING THE PRESENCE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIA OF NOT ONLY NEGATIVE LEGAL LIABILITY FOR VIOLATIONS OF LEGAL NORMS, BUT ALSO A POSITIVE COMPONENT OF THIS PHENOMENON.THE DEPENDENCE OF THE PREVENTION OF OFFENSES IS SUBSTANTIATED NOT SO MUCH ON THE EFFECT OF NEGATIVE LEGAL LIABILITY, BUT ON POSITIVE.THE OPINION IS EXPRESSED THAT THE OPPOSITES OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY CAN BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF PAIRED CATEGORIES.SUCH PAIRING IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE CONTRADICTORY NATURE OF EACH MANIFESTATION OF RESPONSIBILITY. THE NECESSITY OF FURTHER RESEARCH OF POSITIVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PREVENTION OF OFFENSES IN VARIOUS WAYS OF LEGAL REGULATION IS PROVED.A NUMBER OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE LEGAL LIABILITY SYSTEM ARE BEING ESTABLISHED. THE PROBLEM OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE BODIES IS TOUCHED UPON, THE FUNCTIONING OF OTHER TYPES OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, THE FORMATION OF A RULE OF LAW, AND ULTIMATELY THE PREVENTION OF OFFENSES, DEPENDS ON ITS EFFECTIVENESS.CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ABOUT THE HISTORICAL NATURE OF THE NORMATIVE NATURE OF POSITIVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, ITS PREDETERMINATION BY THE ENTIRE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE VERY NEED FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.MOREOVER, THE PREVENTION OF OFFENSES BY MEANS OF POSITIVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY IS CARRIED OUT BY "SOFT" METHODS AND MEANS.IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DIALECTICAL INTERACTION OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE COMPONENT OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ABOUT THE PREVENTION OF THE POSITIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT ONLY OFFENSES, BUT ALSO OF NEGATIVE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AS SUCH.
201	PURPOSE - THE PAST FEW DECADES HAVE SEEN A GRADUAL CONVERGENCE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NORMS THE WORLD OVER, ENTAILING A DISCERNIBLE SHIFT TOWARDS SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY MODELS. IT HOLDS PARTICULARLY TRUE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE STEADILY AMENDED CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NORMS TO ENHANCE THE SCOPE OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS. THIS IS USUALLY JUSTIFIED THROUGH THE RATIONALE THAT INCREASING PROTECTION FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS WOULD MEAN GREATER INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL MARKET AND OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT. IN INDIA, THE SHIFT COINCIDES WITH A SERIES OF FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY REFORMS INITIATED IN THE 1990S: COLLECTIVELY AND LOOSELY REFERRED TO AS "LIBERALISATION", THIS PROCESS MARKS A PARADIGM-SHIFT FROM A TIGHTLY CONTROLLED WELFARE ECONOMY TO ONE CONSIDERABLY MORE LAISSEZ-FAIRE IN ITS ORIENTATION. A FALLOUT OF WHICH WAS THAT THE NEED TO ATTRACT AND SUSTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED AN UNPRECEDENTED SIGNIFICANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO HELP THE READERS UNDERSTAND IN THIS LARGER CONTEXT THE CORPORATE LAW REFORM INITIATIVES IN INDIA, PARTICULARLY THOSE PERTAINING TO SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ALLIED ISSUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS PAPER EMPIRICALLY TESTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ENHANCED SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION LEADS TO GREATER LEVELS OF INVESTMENTS, AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS GENERALLY. IT THEN USES REGRESSION ANALYSIS TO DETECT IF THE CHANGE IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, MAKING IT MORE SHAREHOLDER-FRIENDLY, HAS HAD ANY EFFECT ON GROWTH IN FINANCIAL MARKET. IT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO BROAD PARTS. THE FIRST TRACKS THE EVOLUTION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE NORMS IN INDIA. A ROBUST QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE TILT TOWARDS A SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY REGIME THAT INDIAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REGIME NOW DISPLAYS. THE SECOND CHAPTER DEALS WITH THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WHERE THE OUTCOME VARIABLE IS FINANCIAL MARKET GROWTH, AND EXPLANATORY VARIABLE IS THE CHANGE IN THE GOVERNANCE REGIME WITH RELEVANT CONTROL VARIABLES. FINDINGS - THE AUTHORS FIND THAT CHANGE IN SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON FINANCIAL MARKET GROWTH IN INDIA. THE AUTHORS WOULD SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE LAW IN BOOKS, MORE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO IMPLEMENT THOSE REGULATIONS AND INCREASE THE OVERALL RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT SUCH A WIDE-SCALE STUDY HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN INDIA, USING BAYESIAN METHODS. IT OUGHT TO BE OF IMMENSE VALUE TO PROFESSIONALS AND ACADEMICS BOTH.
202	WHEN A PROVOCATEUR INTENTIONALLY PROVOKES A DEADLY AFFRAY, THE LAW OF SELF-DEFENSE HOLDS THAT THE PROVOCATEUR MAY NOT USE DEADLY FORCE TO DEFEND HIMSELF. WHY IS THIS SO? PROVOCATEURS ARE OFTEN SEEN AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM OF ACTIO LIBERA IN CAUSA, THE CAUSING OF THE CONDITIONS OF ONE'S DEFENSE. THIS ARTICLE REJECTS THEORIES THAT MAINTAIN A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH TO ACTIO LIBERA IN CAUSA, AND ARGUES THAT PROVOCATEURS NEED SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT WHY THEY FORFEIT THEIR DEFENSIVE RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE FURTHER CLAIMS THAT PROVOCATEURS NEED TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR COUSINS, INITIAL AGGRESSORS, AS INITIAL AGGRESSORS ENGAGE IN CONDUCT THAT GROUNDS THE PERMISSIBILITY OF THE DEFENDER'S BEHAVIOR WHEREAS THE PROVOCATEUR'S BEHAVIOR DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE RESPONDENT'S USE OF FORCE AGAINST HIM. IN ADDITION, THIS ARTICLE REJECTS THAT THE BASIS OF THIS FORFEITURE CAN BE FOUND IN THE DOCTRINES SURROUNDING WHEN AND WHY MITIGATION FOR PROVOCATION IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE RESPONDENT. PROVOCATEURS FORFEIT THEIR DEFENSIVE RIGHTS FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY START THE FIGHT. THIS FORFEITURE OCCURS WHEN THEY BEHAVE CULPABLY, MEANING THAT THEY SUBJECTIVELY APPRECIATE THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THE RISK OF CAUSING FORCE TO BE USED AGAINST THEM AND THEY ENGAGE IN THIS BEHAVIOR WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION OR EXCUSE. THE QUESTION OF WHEN THE PROVOCATEUR'S BEHAVIOR IS JUSTIFIED IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX. IT REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF WHEN IT IS THAT ONE IS JUSTIFIED IN INCREASING THE RISK OF ANOTHER'S WRONGDOING. ANY ANALYSIS OF THIS JUSTIFICATION MUST TAKE SERIOUSLY THE LIBERTY RIGHTS OF THE POTENTIAL PROVOCATEUR TO ENGAGE IN OTHERWISE PERMISSIBLE BEHAVIOR. MOREOVER, THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE PROVOCATEUR IS JUSTIFIED WILL TURN ON WHETHER THE LATER ACTS THAT HE PUTS INTO MOTION ARE THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED. THUS, WHEN CHARLES BRONSON IN THE MOVIE DEATH WISH PRESENTS HIMSELF AS A VICTIM SO THAT MUGGERS WILL ATTACK HIM, THE JUSTIFIABILITY OF HIS CONDUCT IN APPEARING AS A VULNERABLE VICTIM WILL TURN ON WHETHER HE IS ENTITLED TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONDUCT, INTENDING TO LATER DEFEND HIMSELF. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN DEATH WISH-TYPE CASES, THE REASON THAT THE PROVOCATEUR IS NOT JUSTIFIED IS BECAUSE HE BECOMES A VIGILANTE, THEREBY USURPING THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND UNDERMINING RULE OF LAW VALUES.
203	THE PERIOD FROM THE LATE 1950S TO THE MID-1960S IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS KNOWN AS THE "THAW," A POLITICAL ERA THAT FOSTERED HOPES OF RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY TO THE COUNTRY. IN THAT PERIOD CYBERNETICS CAME TO SYMBOLIZE BOTH SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND SOCIAL CHANGE. THE SOVIET INTELLIGENTSIA HAD SURVIVED THE HARDSHIP OF STALINIST REPRESSION AND NOW REGARDED THE NEW DISCIPLINE, WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND THE HUMAN SCIENCES, AS A PATHWAY TO BUILDING A FREER AND MORE EQUAL SOCIETY. AFTER DECADES OF DOMINATION BY PAVLOVIAN DOCTRINE, A PARADIGM SHIFT WAS UNDER WAY IN PHYSIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY. CYBERNETICS REINFORCED THE NEW PARADIGM, WHICH PUT FORWARD IDEAS OF PURPOSIVE BEHAVIOR AND SELF-ORGANIZATION IN LIVING AND NON-LIVING SYSTEMS. THE CONDITIONED REFLEX AND A SIMPLISTIC ONE-TO-ONE VIEW OF CONNECTIONS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GAVE WAY TO MORE SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX MODELS, WHICH COULD BE FORMALIZED MATHEMATICALLY. PREVIOUS MODELS OF CONTROL IN LIVING ORGANISMS WERE MOSTLY HIERARCHICAL AND INCLUDED TOP-DOWN CONTROL OF PERIPHERAL MOVEMENT BY THE MOTOR CENTERS. THE NEW MODELS SUPPLEMENTED THIS PICTURE WITH FEEDBACK COMMANDS FROM THE PERIPHERY TO THE CENTER. BY THE TIME CYBERNETICS HAD MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN THE SOVIET UNION, NEW MODELS OF CONTROL HAD ALREADY BEEN FORMULATED IN PHYSIOLOGY BY NIKOLAY BERNSTEIN (1896-1966). HE TERMED THE FEEDBACK FROM AFFERENT SIGNALS "SENSORIAL CORRECTIONS", MEANING THAT THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN ADAPTING CENTRAL CONTROL TO THE CHANGING SITUATION AT THE PERIPHERY OF MOVEMENT. THE NEW PARADIGM EMPHASIZED HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS OVER VERTICAL ONES, AND NEW MODELS TOOK HOLD BASED ON LESS "TOTALITARIAN" AND MORE "DEMOCRATIC" PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS THE IDEA OF AUTOMATIC OR AUTONOMOUS FUNCTIONING OF INTERMEDIATE CENTERS, THE MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT OF WELL-ORGANIZED FUNCTIONS, THE THEORY OF "THE COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR OF AUTOMATA," ETC. THIS LINE OF RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE USSR AS WELL AS ABROAD BY BERNSTEIN'S STUDENTS AND FOLLOWERS WHO FORMED THE MOSCOW SCHOOL OF MOTOR CONTROL. 'THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THIS PREFERENCE FOR LESS HIERARCHICAL MODELS WAS ONE EXPRESSION OF THE THAW'S TREND TOWARD LIBERALIZATION OF LIFE WITHIN THE USSR AND GREATER INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.
204	PURPOSE - OVER A SHORT INTERVAL OF TIME (I.E. 2011-2014), EGYPT HAS EXPERIENCED TECTONIC POLITICAL SHIFTS, INCLUDING THE TOPPLING OF A LONG-ENTRENCHED DICTATOR, TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AND A MILITARY COUP. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF SUCH EVENTS ON THE COUNTRY'S EQUITY MARKET BEHAVIOUR, BOTH IN TERMS OF RETURNS AND VOLATILITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE DATA SET IS COMPOSED OF DAILY STOCK INDEX CLOSING PRICES FOR THE OVERALL MARKET AND TOP EIGHT MOST ACTIVELY TRADED SECTORS. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE CONSIDERED EVENTS ON THE MARKET AND SECTOR RETURNS, AN EVENT STUDY APPROACH IS APPLIED. ON THE OTHER HAND, A UNIVARIATE VAR-EGARCH MODEL IS EMPLOYED TO EXPLORE WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, VOLATILITIES AT THE MARKET AND SECTOR LEVELS RESPOND TO SUCH EVENTS. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE RISK-RETURN PROFILES OF ALMOST ALL MARKET SECTORS, WITH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF INTENSITY. BY AND LARGE, THE PRICE AND VOLATILITY EFFECTS ARE MOST PRONOUNCED IN BANKS, FINANCIAL SERVICES EXCLUDING BANKS AND CHEMICALS SECTORS, WHILST FOOD AND BEVERAGES AS WELL AS CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS SECTORS ARE FOUND TO BE THE LEAST RESPONSIVE TO THESE EVENTS. THE 2013 MILITARY COUP TURNS OUT TO BE THE MOST PERVASIVE EVENT IMPINGING ON THE MARKET AND SECTOR-SPECIFIC INDICES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS HAVE A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THAT COULD BE OF INTEREST TO MANY PARTIES INVOLVED. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WITH POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION OVERSHADOWING BUSINESS AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES IN EGYPT, GENUINE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS, WHICH ENTAIL PROPER REGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, MUST HAVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF POLICYMAKERS, IN ORDER TO SECURE A POSITIVE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND TO FOSTER INVESTOR CONFIDENCE. FURTHERMORE, IN TANDEM WITH CONSIDERING OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS, MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES NEED TO HAVE A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF EGYPT'S FUTURE POLITICAL COURSE AND TO DEVELOP MORE ROBUST CONTINGENCY PLANS TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT POTENTIAL THREATS GENERATED BY POLITICAL VICISSITUDES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - TO THE AUTHOR'S BEST KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THE PRICE AND VOLATILITY EFFECTS OF THE RECENT PRESIDENTIAL EVENTS IN EGYPT, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN THIS AREA.
205	THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO DESCRIBE "HORTATORY MANDATES" AND ARTICULATE PRINCIPLES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW. HORTATORY MANDATES ARE LAWS WHOSE FORM AND FUNCTION COLLIDE. EITHER THEY SPEAK IN MANDATORY TERMS BUT LACK PENALTIES OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS, OR THEY SPEAK IN HORTATORY, PRECATORY TERMS THAT BE-LIE THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS THEY CREATE. OUR ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT EXAMPLES-THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THE CLEAN AIR ACT, FEDERAL DIETARY GUIDELINES, AND COVID-19 MITIGATION ORDERS-INDICATES THAT POLICYMAKERS REGULARLY DEPLOY HORTATORY MANDATES FOR INSTRUMENTAL REASONS RATHER THAN PURELY SYMBOLIC OR PRECATORY REASONS. IN MATTERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AND BEYOND, SO-CALLED "SOFT LAW" IS NOW A PREFERRED TOOL OF GOVERNMENT. HORTATORY MANDATES ARE NOT A QUIRK OF LEGISLATIVE CONTORTIONS TO PASS HEALTH REFORM OR THE EXIGENCIES OF OUR CURRENT PANDEMIC; THEY ARE PROBABLY HERE TO STAY.THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING WHICH HORTATORY MANDATES SHOULD BE REVIEWABLE BY COURTS AND WHICH ONES ARE BEST LEFT TO THE OTHER BRANCHES. WE ARGUE THAT THE ESSENTIAL INQUIRY FOR COURTS IS WHETHER A HORTATORY MANDATE ESTABLISHES A BINDING, ENFORCEABLE NORM. THIS CAN BE DEMONSTRATED BY POINTING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF COERCIVE MEANS TO ENFORCE THE NORM OR CREDIBLE SIGNALS THAT THE NORM WILL IN FACT BE ENFORCED. AFTER ALL, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS THAT ARE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE ARE NOT REALLY HORTATORY; THEY ARE MANDATORY, REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE TO THE CONTRARY. LIKEWISE, GOVERNMENT AC-TIONS THAT CREATE NO BINDING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MERELY HORTATORY AND SHOULD NOT INVOKE THE POWER OF THE COURTS-AGAIN, REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE TO THE CON-TRARY. IN SUCH CASES, JUDICIAL DETERMINATIONS CLARIFYING THE HORTATORY NATURE OF AN ORDER, AND THUS EXCLUDING IT FROM REVIEW, MAY FACILITATE POLITICAL CHECKS AND BALANCES ON ANY HORTATORY MANDATES THAT OVERREACH. IF THE GOVERNMENT IS TRY-ING TO REGULATE BEHAVIOR ON THE SLY, LITIGATION CAN FORCE THE QUESTION EARLY, FOS-TERING MORE ROBUST POLITICAL DEBATE AND-POTENTIALLY-NONJUDICIAL INTERVENTION TO REDIRECT THE GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH. WE ALSO CAUTION THAT ABUSE OF HORTA-TORY MANDATES CAN DEGRADE THE RULE OF LAW AND UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST AND COMPLIANCE.
206	WHEN AND HOW SHOULD COURTS PROTECT INDIVIDUAL RELIANCE UPON UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENTAL ACTS? THIS QUESTION ARISES IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS IN ALL FIELDS OF PUBLIC LAW. HOWEVER, DESPITE ITS PERVASIVENESS, THE PROBLEM OF "BAD RELIANCE" HAS HARDLY DRAWN ANY SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT TO FILL THIS GAP. THE ARTICLE ADOPTS A CROSS-PUBLIC LAW PERSPECTIVE AND MAKES TWO MAIN NORMATIVE CLAIMS. FIRST, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT GIVEN THEIR DUTY TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, COURTS SHOULD USUALLY INVALIDATE UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENTAL ACTS EVEN IF THEY HAVE INDUCED EXTENSIVE RELIANCE. HOWEVER, IN CASES WHERE RELIANCE UPON AN UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENTAL ACT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE EXERCISE OF PERSONAL AUTONOMY UNDERSTOOD AS THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO CONTROL THEIR DESTINY BY PURSUING THEIR OWN LIFE PLANS COURTS SHOULD NEVERTHELESS CONSIDER GIVING EFFECT TO UNLAWFUL ACTS. SECOND, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHEN A COURT DECIDES TO PROTECT RELIANCE UPON AN UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENTAL ACT, IT SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT SUCH PROTECTION MAY HAVE ON THE EX ANTE INCENTIVES OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A TWO-TIER STRATEGY THAT COURTS CAN USE TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. UNDER THIS STRATEGY, COURTS SHOULD EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONDEMN UNLAWFUL GOVERNMENTAL BEHAVIOR. THEREAFTER, THEY SHOULD EXERCISE BROAD DISCRETION WITH RESPECT TO THE REMEDIAL MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PROTECT RELIANCE UPON IT. THIS STRATEGY ENSURES THAT GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES WILL KNOW WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES OF THEM AND THAT THEY WILL PAY A REPUTATIONAL PRICE FOR VIOLATING IT. AT THE SAME TIME, IT RENDERS THE BENEFITS THAT GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES CAN GAIN FROM SUCH VIOLATIONS UNCERTAIN. FOLLOWING THE NORMATIVE ANALYSIS, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO EXAMINING SEVERAL DOCTRINES AND DEVICES THAT COURTS HAVE USED TO PROTECT BAD RELIANCE. THIS EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE RATIONALES AND CONSIDERATIONS DISCUSSED IN THE ARTICLE ALREADY FIND EXPRESSION IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE, WHILE OTHERS OFFER CRITICAL INSIGHTS INTO THIS PRACTICE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CASE LAW ANALYSIS ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEMS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTECTION OF BAD RELIANCE ALONG THE LINES PRESCRIBED BY THIS ARTICLE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE THESE DIFFICULTIES SHOULD NOT DISSUADE COURTS FROM PROTECTING BAD RELIANCE, THEY SHOULD AFFECT THEIR CHOICE AMONG ALTERNATIVE REMEDIAL SOLUTIONS.
207	MALARIA ERADICATION RAISES MANY ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THESE CHALLENGES, DRAWING ON EVIDENCE FROM PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO ERADICATE MALARIA, WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS; SUMMARIZES MORE RECENT EVIDENCE ON THE CHALLENGES, DRAWING ON THE LITERATURE ON THE DIFFICULTIES OF SCALING-UP MALARIA CONTROL AND STRENGTHENING HEALTH SYSTEMS MORE BROADLY; AND EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE BODIES OF EVIDENCE FOR THE CURRENT CALL FOR ELIMINATION AND INTENSIFIED CONTROL. ECONOMIC ANALYSES DATING FROM THE ERADICATION ERA, AND MORE RECENT ANALYSES, SUGGEST THAT, IN GENERAL, THE BENEFITS OF MALARIA CONTROL OUTWEIGH THE COSTS, THOUGH FEW STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE RELATIVE RETURNS TO ERADICATION VERSUS LONG-TERM CONTROL. ESTIMATES OF FINANCIAL COSTS ARE SCANTY AND DIFFICULT TO COMPARE. IN THE 1960S, THE CONSOLIDATION PHASE APPEARED TO COST LESS THAN $1 PER CAPITA AND, IN 1988, WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $2.31 PER CAPITA (BOTH IN 2006 PRICES). MORE RECENT ESTIMATES FOR HIGH COVERAGE OF CONTROL MEASURES SUGGEST A PER CAPITA COST OF SEVERAL DOLLARS. INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES FACED BY MALARIA ERADICATION INCLUDED LIMITS TO THE RULE OF LAW (A MAJOR PROBLEM WHERE MALARIA WAS CONCENTRATED IN BORDER AREAS WITH MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES), THE EXISTENCE AND PERFORMANCE OF LOCAL IMPLEMENTING STRUCTURES, AND POLITICAL SUSTAINABILITY AT NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVELS. RECENT ANALYSES OF THE CONSTRAINTS TO SCALING-UP MALARIA CONTROL, TOGETHER WITH THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE, ARE USED TO DISCUSS THE ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES THAT FACE THE RENEWED CALL FOR ERADICATION AND INTENSIFIED CONTROL. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING A RESEARCH AGENDA COVERING: ISSUES OF THE ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY OF MALARIA ERADICATION, ESPECIALLY USING MACRO-ECONOMIC MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF MALARIA ERADICATION AND INTENSIFIED CONTROL, AND STUDIES OF THE LINKS BETWEEN MALARIA CONTROL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE VARIOUS TOOLS AND MIXES OF TOOLS EMPLOYED IN CONTROL AND ERADICATION ISSUES CONCERNING THE EXTENSION OF COVERAGE OF INTERVENTIONS AND SERVICE DELIVERY APPROACHES, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN REACH THE POOREST RESEARCH ON THE PROCESSES OF FORMULATING AND IMPLEMENTING MALARIA CONTROL AND ERADICATION POLICIES, AT BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS RESEARCH ON FINANCING ISSUES, AT GLOBAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS.
208	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEEDINGS IN CASES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND PRE-TRIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE BRICS MEMBER STATES. THE ARTICLE OBSERVES THAT IN THE BRICS COUNTRIES, THE ISSUES OF PRE-TRIAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT ARE RESOLVED USING THE SAME MECHANISMS: NEGOTIATION AND CONCILIATION PROCEDURES, INCLUDING MEDIATION. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE MECHANISMS IS POSSIBLE BY THE PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE THEMSELVES, WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS PROXIES OR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN CARRYING OUT THE PROCEDURES, AND WITH THE SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL MEDIATORS. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL, THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA BELONG TO DIFFERENT LEGAL FAMILIES, WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY IS A FEATURE OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE PROCEEDINGS AS WELL AS OF THEIR PRE-TRIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT ROMAN LAW LARGELY INFLUENCED ALL OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INDIA, WHOSE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS FORMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ENGLISH LAW, AND THAT THE VERSATILITY OF LEGAL REGULATION DOES NOT ALLOW ONE TO SPEAK FULLY ABOUT THE BALANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGISLATION IN THE STUDIED AREAS. FURTHERMORE, IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENT CANNOT BE AIMED AT HUMILIATING THE HUMAN DIGNITY OF A NATURAL PERSON, CAUSING HIM OR HER PHYSICAL SUFFERING, NOR CAN IT BE AIMED AT DAMAGING THE BUSINESS REPUTATION OF A LEGAL PERSON. THE SIMILARITY OF THE TASKS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGISLATION OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES IS NOTED, WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE THE PROTECTION OF THE SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF CITIZENS, ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC ORDER AND PUBLIC SAFETY, AND THE PREVENTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES. THROUGH THE DISCOURSE PRESENTED BY THE AUTHORS, THE CONCEPT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSE IS REVEALED; THE ACTS REGULATING THE PROCEEDINGS IN CASES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES ARE CONSIDERED, AS WELL AS THE TASKS AND PRINCIPLES ESTABLISHED BY NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN THIS DIRECTION. FURTHERMORE, THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN THE LEGAL REGULATION OF PROCEEDINGS IN CASES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENSES AND PRE-TRIAL SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES ARE REVEALED.
209	THE TERM "REGULATION" MIGRATES FROM ONE SCIENCE TO ANOTHER, GETTING NEW QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS THEREBY GIVING RISE TO A NEW RANGE OF PROBLEMS FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF THE CONTRADICTIONS OF REGULATION. IN THIS REGARD, THERE IS A GROWING NEED IN THE STUDY AND SYNTHESIS OF THE THEORIES OF REGULATION AND REGULATORY CHANGES FROM THE POSITION OF INTEGRITY AND DIRECTIONS OF IMPROVEMENT OF STATE ECONOMIC POLICY. THREE APPROACHES ARE SUGGESTED DESCRIBING THE PREREQUISITES OF REGULATION - INTEREST, IDEAS, INSTITUTIONS. THE INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY OF REGULATION THEORIES ALLOWED IDENTIFYING THE DIVERSE PROBLEMATIC FIELD OF REGULATION: SOCIAL WELFARE GROWTH AND PUBLIC INTEREST PROTECTION; COLLECTIVE ACTIONS OF INTEREST GROUPS AND COMPETITION BETWEEN THEM, INTERACTION BETWEEN INTEREST GROUPS AND THE STATE; PATTERNS OF COLLECTIVE DECISION- MAKING AND THE PROBLEM OF CHOICE BASED ON SELFISHNESS OF BEHAVIOR, DIFFERENCES IN INCENTIVES, CONSTRAINTS AND LEVEL OF DEMOCRATIZATION; THE CHOICE BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE REAL INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS OF REGULATION. REGULATORY CHANGES SUGGEST THE TRANSFORMATION OF REGULATION IMPULSE FROM PROBLEM SOLVING (AWARENESS OF THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES, BETWEEN REALITY AND THE POSSIBLE STATE) AND ORDER (EXISTENCE OF SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS) OF REGULATORY PROCESS PARTICIPANTS INTO NEW IDEAS. THIS LED TO A RADICAL CHANGE OF THE ROLE OF STATE REGULATION IN THE ECONOMIC POLICY OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD: EXPANSION OF THE MEMBERSHIP OF REGULATION FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS TO MARKET, PUBLIC AND SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; FORMATION OF A HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM OF DECISION MAKING AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT; CHANGING OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN DELEGATING AUTHORITY, DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITY (LIABILITY), BENEFITS, COSTS AND RISKS OF REGULATORY IMPACT; EMERGENCE OF NEW AND PRESUMABLY LESS COSTLY FORMS OF REGULATION AS ALTERNATIVES TO STATE REGULATION (SELF- REGULATION, CO- REGULATION, QUASI- REGULATION); INTRODUCTION OF PROCEDURAL MECHANISMS PROVIDING EXPERT EXAMINATION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REGULATION; INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN INTENDED TO ENSURE COOPERATION AND REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE PROCESS OF INTERACTION TO ACHIEVE THE FLEXIBILITY OF STATE ECONOMIC POLICY. ULTIMATELY, THE MAIN TRENDS OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF REGULATION IS TO IDENTIFY THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS, PROCEDURES FOR CREATING INCENTIVES TO ACHIEVE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL EFFECTIVENESS, RULE OF LAW AND IMPROVE THE CREDIBILITY OF STATE ECONOMIC POLICY.
210	ACCESSIBILITY OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY IS THE REALIZATION OF ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF A PERSON AND A CITIZEN -THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST DEMOCRATIC AND EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR SUCH PROTECTION, WHICH IS JUSTICE. THIS FACT IS REFLECTED IN BOTH INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS AND UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION. HOWEVER, THE ISSUE OF JUSTICE ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL CATEGORIES AND GROUPS OF THE POPULATION STILL REMAINS QUITE ACUTE. THIS IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE INSUFFICIENT LEGAL CULTURE OF THE POPULATION, AND, IN ADDITION, INSUFFICIENT LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EMPHASIZE THE RELEVANCE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN IDENTIFYING AND OVERCOMING ISSUES OF JUSTICE ACCESSIBILITY. THE MAIN RESEARCH OBJECT IN THIS ARTICLE IS THE SOCIAL RELATIONS THAT ARISE IN ENSURING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF ACCESSIBILITY OF JUSTICE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS, LEGAL ENTITIES, AND PUBLIC ENTITIES. THE RESEARCH SUBJECT IS THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS IN THIS AREA, AS WELL AS THE VIEWS OF CONTEMPORARY UKRAINIAN SCHOLARS ON THE CONCEPT AND ESSENCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE ACCESSIBILITY. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY LIES IN ESTABLISHING THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF THIS PRINCIPLE AND ITS CONDITIONALITY BOTH BY REMOVING OBSTACLES TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF PERSONS AND BY ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF STATE GUARANTEES ENSURING ACCESS TO JUSTICE. ALSO, THIS CRITERION MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE ACTUAL EFFICIENCY OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ITSELF BASED ON THIS CRITERION. THE RELEVANCE OF THE RESEARCH IS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM PLAYS AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. SINCE ONE OF THE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF OUR STATE IS THE RULE OF LAW, THE JUDICIARY SHOULD ADEQUATELY FULFILL ITS FUNCTION. THE JUDICIARY IS INDEPENDENT, AND THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF UKRAINE GUARANTEE SUCH INDEPENDENCE. THESE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, ON WHICH THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BUILT, DETERMINE THE PECULIARITIES OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE DEMOCRATIC NATURE OF THE JUSTICE PRINCIPLES LIES IN THE FACT THAT THEY ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS ADMINISTERED ON AN EQUAL BASIS, ONLY BY A COURT, COLLEGIALLY, BY INDEPENDENT JUDGES, OPENLY, USING THE STATE LANGUAGE, WITH THE PROCESS RECORDED, AND IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.
211	THE 1 FEBRUARY 2021 COUP D'ETAT IN MYANMAR DID MORE THAN FORCE THE COUNTRY'S JOURNALISTS AND OTHER MEDIA MAKERS TO OPERATE UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE THEIR WORK, AND WIN BACK THE SPACE FOR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE PRESS LOST TO THEM. THE COUP ALSO PROVOKED A MASSIVE CULTURAL SHIFT, AND THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE PLAYING A KEY ROLE. AFTER A HALF CENTURY OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, A DECADE OF MUCH-LAUDED DEMOCRATIC OPENING (2011-20) PRIOR TO THE COUP HAD USHERED IN GAME-CHANGING DEVELOPMENTS TO THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE. YET SINCE THE COUP, THE JUNTA AND ITS APPOINTED STATE ADMINISTRATIVE COUNCIL (SAC) HAVE INFLICTED THE KINDS OF BRUTALITIES IN RESPONSE TO PEACEFUL PROTESTERS THAT THE MILITARY HAS USED FOR DECADES WITH IMPUNITY AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S ETHNIC MINORITIES, ALL JUSTIFIED, THEY CLAIM, TO ENSURE 'THE RULE OF LAW' AND 'LAW AND ORDER'. THE SAC HAS ALSO ATTEMPTED COMPLETE CONTROL OVER MYANMAR'S MEDIA, CUTTING OFF AT VARIOUS TIMES NEARLY ALL INTERNET AND MOBILE ACCESS. THIS INCLUDED FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND OTHER APPS, THEREBY SILENCING THE COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENT MEDIA OR FORCING THEM INTO FORMS OF SELF-CENSORSHIP, HIDING OR EXILE, AND ALLOWING ONLY A MILITARY-CONTROLLED NARRATIVE OF UNFOLDING EVENTS THROUGH MILITARY- AND STATE-RUN MEDIA. YET THE INDEPENDENT MEDIA SECTOR HAS NOT ONLY SURVIVED, IT HAS PROVEN TO BE A KEY VOICE IN EFFORTS TO THWART THE REGIME'S ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL PUBLIC MEDIATED SPACE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE VARIOUS APPROACHES TO MEDIA POLICY-MAKING IN MYANMAR DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE AFTERMATH OF THE COUP, AS EMPLOYED BY THE MILITARY, THE ELECTED BUT LATER OVERTHROWN NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY GOVERNMENT, VARIOUS KEY COMPONENTS OF THE PRO-DEMOCRACY FORCES, AND INTERNATIONAL AID AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO INCREASE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE PRESS. IT DRAWS FROM INTERVIEWS WITH KEY MEDIA POLICY-MAKERS, JOURNALISTS, ACADEMICS AND FREE EXPRESSION ADVOCATES, AND ANALYSES OF CONTENT FROM THE (NOW) JUNTA-CONTROLLED GLOBAL NEW LIGHT OF MYANMAR AND OTHER KEY DOCUMENTS. IT EXPLORES THE VARIOUS APPROACHES TAKEN AND LESSONS LEARNED BY KEY STAKEHOLDERS WORKING TO CONTROL OR CHANGE PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND THE PRESS IN THE COUNTRY.
212	A RECURRING DEBATE, IN THE AFTERMATH OF MASS ATROCITY, IS WHETHER STATES SHOULD PURSUE TRADITIONAL JUSTICE THROUGH CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS OR PROMOTE PEACE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS LIKE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSIONS (TRCS). AS SCHOLARS HAVE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED, HOWEVER, A MULTITUDE OF MECHANISMS MEANT TO DEAL WITH PAST WRONG DOINGS TEND TO EMERGE DURING PERIODS OF TRANSITION. NONETHELESS, DUE TO THE LEGACY OF THIS POLARIZING DEBATE, ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON HOW THEIR WORK CAN BE MUTUALLY RE-ENFORCING IN PRACTICE. RECENT LITERATURE HAS EXPLORED WHETHER THE SEQUENCE OF THESE MECHANISMS AFFECTS LONG-TERM OUTCOMES, SUCH AS DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT NOT HOW THEIR INTERACTION IN PRACTICE MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO THESE GOALS. THIS ARTICLE HELPS FILL THAT VOID THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE INTERFACE BETWEEN TRCS AND TRADITIONAL JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF GUATEMALA, A COUNTRY WHERE OVER TIME BOTH AROSE. IN ADDITION TO BEING THE FIRST STUDY TO GATHER AND ANALYZE THE SENTENCES IN THE CASES THAT RESULTED IN CONVICTIONS FOR GRAVE CRIMES COMMITTED DURING GUATEMALA'S THIRTY-SIX-YEAR INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICT, IT BASES ITS FINDINGS ON OVER TWO DOZEN INTERVIEWS WITH JUDGES, PROSECUTORS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE CASES. THE STUDY ALSO INCLUDES CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM THE LEADERSHIP OF THE TRCS THAT DOCUMENTED THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED DURING THAT PERIOD. WHAT EMERGED FROM THESE PRIMARY SOURCES IS A COMPELLING EXAMPLE OF HOW THESE MECHANISMS CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY. ON ONE HAND, CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCEEDINGS, OR THE ABSENCE OF THEM, CAN INFORM THE WORK OF TRCS. ON THE OTHER HAND, ALTHOUGH TRCS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PORTRAYED AS SECOND-RATE SUBSTITUTES FOR JUSTICE, THEY CAN SERVE VALUABLE FUNCTIONS THAT PROMOTE RULE OF LAW. FOR INSTANCE, TRCS CAN ACT AS ESSENTIAL INVESTIGATORS AND CUSTODIANS OF EVIDENCE IN CONTEXTS WHERE THE STATE IS COMPLICIT OR DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING ATROCITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THEY CAN BE VEHICLES FOR LIBERALIZATION, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE VOICES, NORMS, AND NARRATIVES TO SURFACE. INDEED, AS THE CASE OF GUATEMALA SHOWS, THEY CAN TRANSFORM LOCAL JUDICIAL DECISION-MAKING BY DIFFUSING INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND RECASTING THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN WAYS THAT INFLUENCE HOW JUDGES DEFINE AND DETERMINE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CRIMES.
213	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CO-OPERATION IS A VITAL BEHAVIORAL SKILL THAT SHOULD BE DEVELOPED IN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, BECAUSE IT IS AN INTANGIBLE FACTOR THAT BOOSTS PRODUCTIVE OUTPUT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER EXPLAINS WHY CO-OPERATION IS AN IMPORTANT INTANGIBLE FACTOR FOR ORGANIZATIONS AND THE LARGER ECONOMY. IT RECOMMENDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL DESIGNS TO REMEDIATE THE PEDAGOGICAL LACK OF FOCUS ON THE COOPERATIVE DISPOSITION. FINDINGS - CO-OPERATION IS CONTINGENT ON TRUST - AN INDISPENSABLE FACTOR TO ENGAGE IN DISTANT RELATIONS, ACCEPT RULE OF LAW ACROSS NATIONS, AND CONFER IN INTERMEDIARIES THE AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATE UNRESOLVED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, WITHOUT CO-OPERATION, PEOPLE WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS COMMIT THEMSELVES TO PAROCHIAL CONCERNS, INHIBITING EFFORTS TO COMBINE RESOURCES TOWARD A COLLECTIVE GOAL. THE LACK OF A COOPERATIVE ATTITUDE IS NOT DESTINY - IT CAN BE FORGED THROUGH CAREFUL EDUCATIONAL DESIGNS AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THERE IS LITTLE EMPIRICAL DATA AVAILABLE TO MEASURE CO-OPERATION IN A DIVERSE ENVIRONMENT AND CO-OPERATION IS AN INTANGIBLE CONCEPT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO PIN TO SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL HABITS. THE CONCEPTS DEVELOPED HERE BASED ON BROAD SOCIAL SCIENCE DATA WOULD DO WILL TO BE TESTED IN AN EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK AT THE MICRO LEVEL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - LOW CO-OPERATION ARISES IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH DOES NOT FOSTER TRUST. MANAGEMENT MIGHT INADVERTENTLY REWARD LOW ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BY NOT EVALUATING CO-OPERATION AND MONITORING NARCISSISM. RECRUITERS NEED TO ADAPT RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES THAT PINPOINT INDIVIDUALS CAPABLE OF MANAGING THE SPECIFIC CO-OPERATION NEEDS OF SITUATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN DIVERSE SITUATIONS. A SUCCESSFUL MANAGERIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM WILL TARGET TRAINING THAT OPTIMIZES THOUGHTFUL AND SUSTAINABLE CO-OPERATION. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - CO-OPERATION IS A FACTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO FOR THE MODERN ORGANIZATION. IT IS BOTH A MORAL AND METHODOLOGICAL DISPOSITION THAT FOSTERS COLLECTIVE ACTION POSITIVELY, WHILE INHIBITING IN-GROUP INTERESTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - FORMAL MANAGEMENT TRAINING TO INSTILL A THOUGHTFUL SENSE OF CO-OPERATION WOULD COMPLEMENT THE CURRENT EMPHASIS ON TEAMWORK AND LEADERSHIP. WITHOUT THE MORAL AND METHODOLOGICAL GOAL OF BEING CO-OPERATIVE FOR THE GREATER GOOD, ORGANIZATIONS WASTE HUMAN RESOURCES AND FAIL TO REAP BENEFITS FROM COLLECTIVE PRODUCTIONS.
214	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE PECULIARITIES AND IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS OF INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE CONDITIONS OF INCREASING ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THREATS OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-POLITICAL CRISIS OF UKRAINE. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH, IT CAN BE STATED THAT IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-POLITICAL CRISIS, THERE IS AN AGGRAVATION OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THREATS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY UNBALANCE THE INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE MAIN SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO DETERMINING THE ESSENCE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, IDENTIFIES THE MAIN FACTORS THAT HAVE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM, IDENTIFIES THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND FINDS OUT THAT THEY INCREASE THEIR DESTABILIZING INFLUENCE IN THE PERIOD OF AGGRAVATION OF ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CHALLENGES AND THREATS OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL-POLITICAL CRISIS. EMPIRICAL EVALUATIONS OF THE INTEGRAL INDICATOR OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN UKRAINE FOR THE PERIOD OF 2018-2021 WERE CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO SUCH SUBINDEXES AS "IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE STATE AND ACCOUNTABILITY", "GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY", "POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE", "QUALITY OF LEGISLATION", "THE RULE OF LAW" AND "CORRUPTION CONTROL", AS A RESULT OF WHICH THEIR CRITICAL VALUES WERE ESTABLISHED, WHICH LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMBALANCE OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM, TO THE DEEPENING OF SOCIAL TENSIONS AND TO THE EXACERBATION OF CRISIS SITUATIONS. THE MAIN MEASURES TO INCREASE THE INSTITUTIONAL STABILITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ARE PROPOSED, AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE FORMATION OF A SPECIAL MECHANISM FOR FORECASTING RISKS, THREATS AND DANGERS TO THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CRISIS SITUATIONS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-POLITICAL CHALLENGES; IMPROVEMENT OF CURRENT DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND ITS HARMONIZATION WITH THE NORMS OF EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW; DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-CORRUPTION MECHANISM AND ITS LEGISLATIVE REGULATION.
215	NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY PROJECTS ARE INCREASINGLY TAKING PLACE IN NON-OECD COUNTRIES, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SANCTITY OF CONTRACTS ARE OFTEN NOT AS WELL DEVELOPED AS IN OECD COUNTRIES. THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY FACES INCREASING POLITICAL RISK AT THE SAME TIME THAT OIL PRICES HAVE BECOME MORE VOLATILE AND PROJECT COSTS HAVE ESCALATED, SOMETIMES SQUEEZING MARGINS. THE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH CAPITAL INTENSITY OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAKES COMPANIES PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO POLITICAL RISK. MIGA, THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY OF THE WORLD BANK, IN ITS WORLD INVESTMENT AND POLITICAL RISK 2011 REPORT, BROADLY DEFINES POLITICAL RISK AS 'THE PROBABILITY OF DISRUPTION OF THE OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES BY POLITICAL FORCES AND EVENTS, WHETHER THEY OCCUR IN HOST COUNTRIES OR RESULT FROM CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. IN HOST COUNTRIES, POLITICAL RISK IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ACTIONS NOT ONLY OF GOVERNMENTS AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT ALSO OF MINORITY GROUPS AND SEPARATIST MOVEMENTS'. THE ESSENCE OF THIS DEFINITION FOCUSES ON THE RISKS ARISING FROM THE ADVERSE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF GOVERNMENTS. POLITICAL RISK INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENCY CONVERTIBILITY AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, EXPROPRIATION, CIVIL UNREST, WAR AND TERRORISM, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND NON-HONOURING OF SOVEREIGN FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. ENERGY INVESTORS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED THAT RETURNS ON PROJECTS IN EMERGING MARKETS COULD SUFFER AS A RESULT OF POLITICAL CHANGES OR INSTABILITY IN THE HOST COUNTRY. IN 2010, A SURVEY OF THE US ENERGY INDUSTRY CONDUCTED BY THE AON CORPORATION, A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF RISK MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE BROKERAGE, RANKED POLITICAL RISK AMONG THE TOP FIVE CHALLENGES FACING THE INDUSTRY. THE SURVEY ALSO REVEALED THAT MOST COMPANIES ARE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED TO ASSESS AND MITIGATE POLITICAL RISK. POLITICAL RISK INSURANCE (PRI) IS A RELATIVELY RECENT INNOVATION IN POSITIONING COMPANIES TO REDUCE OIL AND GAS INVESTMENT RISK. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW PRI CAN BE USED TO MITIGATE RISKS IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR WHEN CONDUCTING BUSINESS ACROSS BORDERS, THUS HELPING TO MANAGE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES A COMPREHENSIVE CASE STUDY OF THE CHAD CAMEROON PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT AND PIPELINE PROJECT TO HIGHLIGHT THE VARIOUS FACETS OF POLITICAL RISK AND HOW THESE CAN BE MITIGATED.
216	THIS CASE NOTE REFLECTS ON THE QUESTION OF THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN (RTBF). THIS QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) IN THE RECENT GOOGLE V. COMMISSION NATIONALE DE L'INFORMATIQUE ET DES LIBERTES (CNIL) CASE, IN WHICH THE FRENCH DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY (DPA) SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH THE OBLIGATION FOR INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES (ISES) TO DELIST SEARCH RESULTS IN ALL VERSIONS OF THEIR SEARCH ENGINE. IN ITS SEPTEMBER 2019 JUDGMENT, THE COURT DID NOT GRANT CNIL'S REQUEST. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH EU LAW DOES NOT CURRENTLY OBLIGE ISES TO DELIST SEARCH RESULTS FROM ALL VERSIONS OF THEIR SEARCH ENGINE, THE COURT CRUCIALLY EMPHASIZED THAT DPAS REMAIN COMPETENT TO ORDER GLOBAL DELISTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF THE RTBF IS IN PRINCIPLE REGIONAL, BUT MAY ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS ALSO BE NATIONAL OR GLOBAL WHERE THE EXERCISE OF BALANCING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SO REQUIRES. LIKE THE INTERNET, THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF THE RTBF THUS APPEARS TO BE FLUID. THIS CASE NOTE DISCUSSES THE GOOGLE V. CNIL CASE FROM TWO ANGLES. FIRST, THE RTBF ENTAILS THE EXERCISE OF BALANCING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY AND THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. THE RTBF IS THEREBY EXEMPLARY OF THE EU'S PRIVACY-ORIENTED DATA PROTECTION LAWS, WHICH DIVERGE FROM MORE EXPRESSION-ORIENTED DATA PROTECTION LAWS OUTSIDE OF THE EU. THIS DIVERGENCE IS CONCERNING FOR THE NORMATIVE FOUNDATION AND THE FEASIBILITY OF A GLOBAL RTBF. SECOND, THE RTBF PLACES A PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT OBLIGATION UPON ISES, WHICH RAISES RULE OF LAW CONCERNS. ALTHOUGH A GLOBAL SCOPE IS ASSUMED TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RTBF, IT WOULD SIMILARLY INCUR AN AMPLIFICATION OF THE EXISTING CHALLENGES WITH ITS ENFORCEMENT. THIS CASE NOTE ESTABLISHES THAT THE JUDGMENT IN THE GOOGLE V. CNIL CASE, MORE SO THAN THE JANUARY 2019 OPINION BY ADVOCATE-GENERAL SZPUNAR, ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH THIS COMPLEX LEGAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE ARGUMENTS RAISED. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE ARGUMENTATION OF THE COURT AND THE AG AND THE QUESTIONS LEFT OPEN IN THE JUDGMENT REVEAL THAT THE TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF THE RTBF WILL REMAIN A CONTENTIOUS TOPIC FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
217	GIVEN ENFORCEABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN THE RELATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS IN SOCIETY, TWO KINDS OF RIGHTS CAN BE DERIVED: PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT THE CITIZEN AND HIS/HER RIGHTS, WE MEAN A SET OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LAW THAT GOVERNS SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. IN FACT, EXPRESSION OF CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS MEANS THAT EVERY PERSON ENJOYS AS BEING A CITIZEN OF A COUNTRY. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS IS TO THE EXTENT THAT IS CLOSELY RELATED TO PLACE THE RULE OF FINDS AND EVEN SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT A SOCIETY IN WHICH THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT FALTERS CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED. GUARANTEE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS, PRIMARILY IMPLIES BY INSERTING THESE RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF EVERY COUNTRY ACT. IN OTHER WORDS, IT TAKES AN EFFECTIVE STEP IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTION RULE OF LAW, FREEDOM AND ENJOYMENT OF FACILITIES AND TAKE CITIZENSHIP. BUT WE MUST CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THE PROTECTION AND SAFEGUARDING OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS IS ON THE SHOULDERS OF ALL POWERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE NECESSARY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. BESIDES, THEIR EXECUTIVE UNITS OPERATE IN ALL ADMINISTRATIVE FORMALITIES THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND LEGAL AND IN THE CASE OF NOT CONFORMING CITIZENS' RIGHTS ARE NOT OVERWHELM THE DEVICE GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE A COMPETENT JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES THAT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT DEFEND THE PRINCIPLES OF A FAIR TRIAL. SO THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER LAWS, REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THESE RIGHTS BY THE STATE, THERE IS A COMPETENT JUDICIAL BODY THAT COMPLAINTS ABOUT VIOLATION OF THEIR PEOPLE BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND MONITOR GOVERNMENTAL BODIES ARE RESPONSIBLE IN THIS REGARD. ALL OF THEM ARE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION AND GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COMPLIANCE STANDARDS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF IRAN AND TAJIKISTAN IS A MAJOR POINT OF DISCUSSION AT THE END, TO RECOGNIZING THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF BOTH COUNTRIES AND RICHER THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHTS TO USE THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COUNTRIES.
218	THE PAPER PRESENTS THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGEMENT IN SHAPING THE MAJOR RULES AND INSTITUTES OF ELECTION LAW IN RUSSIA. RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTION AS A GROUNDWORK OF THE RUSSIAN LEGAL SYSTEM KEEPS THE KEY CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA (ART. 3). TO IMPLEMENT THE CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS OF THE PIVOTAL AUTHORITY INSTITUTIONS, FEDERAL LEGISLATOR CREATES LAWS ON THE ORDER AND FORMS OF ELECTION PROCESS MECHANISM. HOWEVER, WITH A HIGH-PROFILE FEATURE OF THE AREA OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, ELECTION LAW IS NOT STABLE. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION EXECUTES THE FUNCTION OF SUPREME GUARANTOR OF ITS CONSTITUTION. DESPITE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS NOT THE INSTANT BODY TO SOLVE ELECTORAL DISPUTES, IT RENDERS A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE ELECTION PROCESS BY CORRECTING RULES OF THE GAME ON THE ELECTORAL FIELD, ASSESSING IN TERMS OF CONSTITUTION THE EXISTING RULES OF ELECTION LAW. THE OBJECT MATTER OF THE RESEARCH IS THE ACTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGEMENT BETWEEN 2013 AND 2015 AND RELATED TO DETERMINING CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS ON ELECTIONS IN RUSSIA. THE SUBJECT MATTER IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ROLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE IN CONTEXT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTORAL LAW. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RULINGS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ENABLES TO IDENTIFY THE ACUTE ISSUES OF ELECTORAL POLITICS AND THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AND AMBIGUOUS ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT ELECTION LEGISLATION. SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATE TO THE LIMITATION OF ELECTION RIGHTS OF PEOPLE DUE TO CRIMINAL RECORD, CONNECTION AND COLLISION IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ELECTION STANDARDS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE EUROPEAN COURT ON HUMAN RIGHTS, NECESSITY IN THE INSTITUTION OF EARLY VOTING IN RUSSIAN ELECTORAL PRACTICE, AND COUNTING THE TERMS OF TENURE IN THE STATE DUMA OF THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE POSSIBILITY TO CHANGE DATE OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT AS TO THE APPOINTMENT OF SO CALLED CITY MANAGERS IN LARGE CITIES INSTEAD OF DIRECT ELECTION. CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE KEEPING THE FREEDOM FROM SUBJECTIVE POLITICAL PREFERENCES BEARS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTION IN THE CONDITIONS OF ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND SOLVE FAIRLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL CONTRADICTIONS AND ANTAGONISMS.
219	PURPOSE: THE AIM OF THE WORK IS A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL STUDY OF APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF THE PHENOMENON OF GAME IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, AS WELL AS DETERMINING THE PLACE AND ROLE OF GAME NORMS AS A SPECIAL TYPE OF SOCIAL REGULATORS IN THE LEGAL SPHERE. DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH: THIS RESEARCH IS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENON OF GAME ACTIVITY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND LEGAL THEORIES. THE THEORY OF GAME ACTIVITY, BEING MULTIFACETED AND COMPLEX, CONTAINS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF THE PHENOMENON UNDER STUDY. THIS WORK, BASED ON THE WORKS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, TRIES TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GAME AND ITS NORMS AND RULES WITH THE SPHERE OF LAW. FINDINGS: AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, THE MAIN APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF THE GAME AS A SOCIAL AND CULTURAL PHENOMENON HAVE BEEN ANALYZED, THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO CORRELATE THE GAME ACTIVITY WITH THE LAW, THE FEATURES CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RULES OF THE GAME AS AN ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL NORMS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PHENOMENON OF GAMES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IS UNDERSTOOD FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SIDES, WHILE, AS A RULE, IT SEEMS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND COMMON FEATURES OF THE DEFINITION OF THE ESSENCE IN A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THESE THEORIES, WHICH INDICATES THE VERSATILITY OF THE PHENOMENON UNDER STUDY. IN THE ISSUE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE RULES OF THE GAME AND LEGAL NORMS, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME ARE PRIMARY IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, ENDOWED WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMON FEATURES. ORIGINAL / VALUE: THE WORK IS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF THE GAME AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO ITS UNDERSTANDING IN VARIOUS SOCIAL SCIENCES. AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DETERMINE THE PLACE OF GAME NORMS IN THE SYSTEM OF SOCIAL REGULATORS OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, THROUGH THE FORMULATION OF CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE RULES OF THE GAME, AS WELL AS FACTORS THAT UNITE GAME AND LAW AS SOCIAL PHENOMENA.
220	IN 2019, 45 YEARS OF THE "CARNATION REVOLUTION" (THE REVOLUTION IN THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC ON APRIL 25, 1974) - AN OUTSTANDING HISTORICAL EVENT OF NATIONAL AND CROSS-BORDER SCALE - ARE CELEBRATED. THE PORTUGUESE REVOLUTION RESULTED FROM BOTH THE INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC AND A CHAIN OF IMPORTANT HISTORICAL EVENTS ON A GLOBAL LEVEL. THE END OF THE WORLD WAR II, THE COLLAPSE OF FASCISM, STRUGGLE FOR ELIMINATION OF THE COLONIAL SYSTEM LED MANKIND TO UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MODERNIZATION. A FRESH WIND OF CHANGE IN THE EARLY 1970S ALSO TOUCHED PORTUGAL. THE PAST DECADES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE APRIL REVOLUTION WAS PART OF A GLOBAL PROCESS OF AUTHORITARIAN AND TOTALITARIAN REGIMES COLLAPSE IN ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD, KNOWN AS THE "THIRD WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION". THE VALUE OF PORTUGUESE EVENTS WENT BEYOND ONE COUNTRY. THEY WERE THE IMPETUS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IN OTHER REGIONS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE "CARNATION REVOLUTION" LAUNCHED THE PROCESS OF DECOLONIZATION THAT HAS CREATED ON THE SITE OF THE PORTUGUESE COLONIES A NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT STATES. DURING THE RELATIVELY SMALL PERIOD (BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS), PORTUGAL HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SPHERES, HAS ESTABLISHED A STABLE POLITICAL SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CHALLENGES. BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION, A DECREPIT COLONIAL EMPIRE WITH A CLOSED AUTHORITARIAN REGIME WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY OPEN TO THE WORLD, WITH A EUROPEAN-STYLE POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW, GUARANTEES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS FOR CITIZENS. THE PORTUGUESE HAVE CHANGED WITHOUT CHANGING THEMSELVES, PRESERVING THE NATIONAL IDENTITY AND TRADITIONS, THE UNIQUE PLACE THAT THE COUNTRY OCCUPIES IN WORLD HISTORY AND AT PRESENT. THE REVOLUTION HAS NOT ONLY CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY, BUT ALSO RADICALLY EXPANDED THE HORIZONS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN LISBON, THE STATES OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN THE CURRENT, EXTREMELY COMPLEX INTERNATIONAL SITUATION, PORTUGAL AIMS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION ON THE WORLD STAGE, EXPAND THE CIRCLE OF TRADE, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL COUNTERPARTS. ONE OF IMPORTANT PARTNERS IN THE SYSTEM OF PORTUGAL'S FOREIGN ECONOMIC TIES IS THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. DESPITE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE LAST TIME, RUSSIAN-PORTUGUESE RELATIONS BASED ON MUTUAL INTEREST MAINTAIN POSITIVE DYNAMICS.
221	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE DELINEATION OF POWERS BETWEEN FEDERAL EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES AND EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE PRINCIPLES WHICH FORM THE BASES FOR DELINEATION OF POWERS IN THE ABOVE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES. AN ASSESSMENT IS GIVEN TO FEDERALISM AS THE BASIC PRINCIPLE PROVIDING ARCHITECTONICS OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES INCLUDING THE SYSTEM OF EXECUTIVE POWER AND ITS BODIES. WHEN WRITING THE ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS RESEARCHED THE CONTENT OF SEVERAL ISSUES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF JURISDICTION OF THE EXECUTIVE BODIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND EXECUTIVE BODIES OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THEY REVEALED THE PROBLEMS OF PRACTICAL VALUE, INCLUDING THOSE PREDETERMINING THE BRANCH AFFILIATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - THE ELEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE. THE FOLLOWING METHODS WERE USED: SYSTEM ANALYSIS, DIALECTIC, LOGICAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHODS, ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION THE STUDY PRODUCED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS: THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 2014 SPAWNED CONTRADICTORY AND AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE STATE (SEE ITEM "ABOUT", ARTICLE 71 AND SUB-ITEM "TO", PART 1, ARTICLE 72 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION), WHICH IS DO NOT PROMOTE THE EFFICIENT DISTRIBUTION OF STATE POWERS BETWEEN THE BODIES OF STATE POWER AND ADMINISTRATION, BOTH IN THE SPHERE OF LAW-MAKING AND IN THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT; THE EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EXECUTIVE BODIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUENT ENTITIES SHALL BE BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMY, INVESTMENTS, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY IN THE REGION, PRESERVATION AND ACCUMULATION OF POSITIVE DYNAMICS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN A RESPECTIVE TERRITORY; THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES ENSURING THE DELINEATION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND REGIONAL EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FEDERALISM, THE RULE OF THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION, THE RULE OF LAW, FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND BUDGET, EQUALITY OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, COORDINATION OF INTERESTS, CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED (CONTRACTUAL) REGULATION IS FORMULATED; THE AUTONOMY OF THE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS FORMAL; THEIR WORK IS UNDER THE MOST SERIOUS LEGAL, FINANCIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES.
222	IF THE NUREMBERG TRIALS REPRESENT THE BIRTH OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW (ICL), THEN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORTS OF THEIR PERSONNEL REPRESENT THE BIRTH OF 'COMMUNICATION IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE'. THIS ASPECT OF THE ALLIED POST-WORLD WAR II PROSECUTIONS OF NAZI WAR CRIMINALS HAS BEEN HITHERTO UNDEREXPLORED IN THE LITERATURE. THIS ARTICLE FILLS THE GAP BY EXAMINING THE ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICAN EFFORTS TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE NUREMBERG TRIALS WHILE THEY WERE UNFOLDING AND IN THEIR IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH. IT BEGINS WITH THE PUBLIC RELATIONS (PR) EFFORTS OF ROBERT JACKSON, CHIEF PROSECUTOR FOR THE INITIAL INTERNATIONAL MILITARY TRIBUNAL (IMT) TRIAL OF THE MAJOR NAZI WAR CRIMINALS, AND HIS PR 'RIGHT HAND MAN', GORDON DEAN. JACKSON AND DEAN TOOK A MULTI-PRONG APPROACH TO MESSAGING ABOUT THE IMT, SEEKING TO EDUCATE THEIR ALLIED PARTNERS ABOUT THE STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OF A DUE-PROCESS-ORIENTED PROCEEDING, WHILE PERSUADING THE AMERICAN POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT ABOUT THE NASCENT COLD WAR-POSITIONING ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A JUSTICE STRATEGY, AS WELL AS DISABUSING THE GLOBAL CITIZENRY OF THE 'VICTORS' JUSTICE' NARRATIVE IN FAVOUR OF A 'GLOBAL RULE OF LAW' MYTHOLOGY. ONCE THE IMT TRIAL WAS CONCLUDED, AND CONFRONTATIONAL US-SOVIET BIPOLAR REALITY BECAME ENTRENCHED, AMERICAN PERSONNEL FOR THE SUBSEQUENT NUREMBERG MILITARY TRIBUNAL (NMT) TRIALS TOOK A DIFFERENT TACT. IN TERMS OF OUTREACH EFFORTS, PR NOW FOCUSED ON GERMAN ATTITUDES TOWARD PROSECUTION EFFORTS: NMT STAFF USED APPEALS TO JUSTICE IN A HEROIC EFFORT TO KEEP RESOURCES FLOWING AND THE TRIAL TIMELINES OPEN-ENDED. BUREAUCRATICALLY, THE PR APPARATUS EVENTUALLY FLOWED TO THE CREATION OF A 'SPECIAL PROJECTS BRANCH', WHICH SOUGHT TO PRESENT THE PUBLIC WITH KEY EXCERPTS FROM THE NMT TRIALS AND PROVIDE VARIOUS GERMAN PROSECUTORS' OFFICES WITH TRANSCRIPTS AND EVIDENCE FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE TRIALS. FROM ITS INCEPTION, THEREFORE, ICL'S EMBRYONIC PR-SPHERE SERVED AS A BATTLEGROUND FOR COMPETING CONCERNS OF TRANSNATIONAL JUSTICE VERSUS GLOBAL REALPOLITIK. BETWEEN THOSE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED POLICY POLES, IT CARVED OUT A SPACE FOR EDUCATION EFFORTS VIS-A-VIS THE LOCAL POPULATION, PRESERVATION OF THE HISTORICAL RECORD, AND CREATION OF A NASCENT BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE FOR PR EFFORTS. THESE MODEST ACHIEVEMENTS WOULD LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD OF COMMUNICATION IN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE.
223	PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHINESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS OFTEN MADE FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT DUE TO THE CLASH OF TWO EQUALLY PREVALENT RIVAL VIEWS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) AND CHINA'S COURTS. ACCORDING TO THE FIRST, THE CCP IS A FREQUENT VIOLATOR OF THE LAW AND MAKES ITS CLAIM TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW A FARCICAL ACT, WHILE ON THE SECOND VIEW, VERY OFTEN EXPRESSED IN DEFENSE AGAINST THE FIRST, THE CCP IS PORTRAYED AS THE ONLY RELIABLE GUARDIAN THAT CAN BUTTRESS THE OTHERWISE VULNERABLE COURTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY PROTECT THE LAW AND ORDER THAT IT SEEKS TO ESTABLISH. IN THIS ARTICLE, I INTEND TO PRESENT AN INTEGRATED AND COHERENT EXPLANATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CCP AND CHINA'S COURTS AND TO EXPLORE THE ROOT CAUSE THAT HAS LED TO THE PERCEIVED CONTRADICTORY IMPACTS OF THE FORMER UPON THE LATTER. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, I WILL START BY TRACKING AND EXAMINING THE INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE PARTY POLITICAL-LEGAL COMMITTEES (PPLCS), FOLLOWED BY AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH PPLCS HAVE CONDUCTED SUPERVISION OVER COURTS. MY PRIMARY FINDING IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CCP AND THE COURTS IS EMBEDDED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN OF THE PARTY STATE, UNDER WHICH THE CCP AND ONLY THE CCP HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE BY INDIVIDUAL STATE INSTITUTIONS AND BY THE STATE AS A WHOLE. AS A RESULT, COURTS ARE AUTHORIZED TO APPLY THE LAW BUT LACK THE AUTHORITY TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW BY INSTITUTIONS OF EQUAL OR HIGHER RANK IN THE POWER HIERARCHY DEFINED BY THE CCP. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT EXHIBITS TWO FEATURES, IN FACT TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. ON THE ONE HAND, THE CCP ASSUMES A PATERNALISTIC ROLE, OBLIGED TO PROVIDE COURTS WITH SUPPORT TO GAIN ACCESS TO OPERATIONAL FUNDS AND OTHER RESOURCES AND TO LEND COURTS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE FROM INSTITUTIONS NORMALLY BEYOND THE REACH OF THE COURTS' OWN AUTHORITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CCP IS ABLE TO PRESERVE THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF DECISION MAKING IN SELECTED AND PRIORITIZED AREAS, WHERE IT CAN DETERMINE JUDICIAL OUTCOMES IN AN ARBITRARY FASHION TO ADVANCE ITS POLITICAL AGENDA AND GOALS THROUGH BOTH OR EITHER OF THE MACRO AND MICRO APPROACHES.
224	AS THE CENTER OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND SOCIAL CIVILIZATION, CITIES HAVE DEVELOPED AT THE COST OF SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND HUGE ECO-ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE, WHICH FURTHER LOWER HUMAN LIVING STANDARDS AND IMPEDE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN ECOSYSTEMS. CURRENT URBAN DYNAMIC METHODS HAVE BROADER VIEWS AND FOCUS MORE ON ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS, E.G., THE IMPACT OF EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE CONSUMPTION, BUT THEY LACK A RIGOROUS THERMODYNAMIC FRAMEWORK. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS A NEED TO MODIFY EXISTING PROCESSES AND DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT WHILE STIMULATING ECOLOGICAL FLOW. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FORECASTING MODEL, NAMED THE EMERGY-BASED URBAN DYNAMIC MODEL, CAPABLE OF ACCURATELY SIMULATING THE OBSERVED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF BEIJING FROM 1999 TO 2039. THIS MODEL DIFFERS FROM PREVIOUS URBAN EMERGY MODELS BY MONITORING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO HUMAN WELL-BEING AND ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY IN THE DEVELOPING URBAN SYSTEM. A FRESH PERSPECTIVE FOCUSES ON URBAN COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE, LINKING SUCH IMPACTS TO A SUPPLY-SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COST EVALUATION (INCLUDING ECOLOGICAL SERVICE SUPPLY, ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES, AND INVESTMENT FOR TREATMENT). IN THIS INTRODUCTORY PAPER, WE PRESENT THE CONCEPTUAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE EMERGY-BASED URBAN DYNAMIC MODEL: THE URBAN ASSETS, LANDS, CAPITALS, POPULATION, WATER RESOURCES, AND ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS. EACH SUBSYSTEM IN THIS MODEL WILL ENRICH THE FEEDBACK DYNAMICS, POLICY LEVERS, AND POST-SCENARIO ANALYSES. STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND CALIBRATION WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN THIS DYNAMIC EMERGY ACCOUNTING. THE SIMULATION REVEALED THAT WATER RESOURCES WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT LIMITING FACTOR FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF BEIJING. A BETTER APPROACH WOULD NOT BE MORE ENGINEERING PROJECTS TO DELIVER NEW SUPPLIES BUT TO CURB DEMAND THROUGH EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN WATER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION USING THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES. THE RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION REVEALED THAT AFTER THE YEAR 2015, MANY EMERGY INDICATORS WILL COLLAPSE. THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY WILL ENABLE URBAN POLICY PLANNERS TO UNDERSTAND THESE INTER-LINKAGES BY ADDRESSING SPECIFIC DAMAGES TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ECOSYSTEM'S INTEGRITY, AS WELL AS BY LINKING SUCH IMPACTS TO A SUPPLY-SIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COST EVALUATION.

225	THREE MAIN TYPES OF MANAGEMENT MODELS FOR PARKS AND PROTECTED AREAS EXIST WITHIN CANADA: THE NATIONAL PARK MODEL, THE PARASTATAL MODEL, AND THE PUBLIC AND FOR-PROFIT COMBINATION MODEL. EACH OF CANADA'S TWO LARGEST AND MOST VISITED PROVINCIAL PARK SYSTEMS USES ONE OF THESE THREE MANAGEMENT MODELS. BRITISH COLUMBIA (BC) USES CONTRACTORS FOR ALL VISITOR SERVICES (PUBLIC AND FOR-PROFIT COMBINATION MODEL) AND ONTARIO (ON) LARGELY USES PARK STAFF (PARASTATAL MODEL). THERE IS DEBATE ON WHICH OF THESE APPROACHES IS PREFERABLE. THIS RESEARCH COMPARED THESE TWO MANAGEMENT MODELS BY ASKING PARK STAFF MEMBERS THEIR OPINIONS ON HOW THEIR AGENCY SATISFIED 10 STANDARD PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE (PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, CONSENSUS ORIENTATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, RESPONSIVENESS, EFFECTIVENESS, EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, RULE OF LAW, AND STRATEGIC VISION). THE SURVEY YIELDED 132 RESPONSES, 63 (47.7%) FROM ON PARKS STAFF AND 69 (52.3%) FROM BC PARKS STAFF. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED 11 PRINCIPLES INSTEAD OF THE 10 ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT ON PARKS STAFF HAVE POSITIVE VIEWS ON THE GOVERNANCE OF THE ON PARKS MODEL FOR ALL 11 FACTORS, WHILE BC PARKS STAFF HAVE POSITIVE VIEWS OF THE BC MODEL FOR 10 OF THE 11. ON PARKS STAFF WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE THAN BC STAFF TOWARD SEVEN OF THE 11 CRITERIA. BC PARKS STAFF FELT NEGATIVELY TOWARD THE CRITERION OF EQUITY-FINANCE. GIVEN THAT THE MAJOR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF PRIVATE CONTRACTORS IN THE DELIVERY OF PARK SERVICES IN BC PARKS IS TO AUGMENT FINANCIAL EQUITY, IT IS NOTABLE THAT PARK STAFF SEEMED ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL EQUITY OF THIS ACTIVITY. THIS IS AMONG THE FIRST STUDIES TO EXAMINE THE ATTITUDES OF PARK STAFF MEMBERS TOWARD THE MANAGEMENT MODELS IN WHICH THEY WORK. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE DIFFERENCES FOUND ARE DUE TO TWO FACTORS: THE MANAGEMENT MODELS USED AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARK STAFF AND THEIR GOVERNMENT. THE RESEARCH REVEALED THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNANCE AS PERCEIVED BY PARK AGENCY STAFF IN ONTARIO AND BRITISH COLUMBIA, THE PARASTATAL MODEL FOR PARK TOURISM MANAGEMENT WAS VIEWED MORE POSITIVELY THAN THE PUBLIC AND FOR-PROFIT COMBINATION MODEL.
226	THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH. TO INVESTIGATE THE CURRENT STATE OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS COMPLIANCE IN THE STATE ARCHIVES.METHODOLOGY. A QUESTIONNAIRE METHOD WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA ON THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE STATE ARCHIVES IN ORGANIZING THE USE OF AND ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS. TO ANALYSE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK, A METHOD OF INTERPRETATION WAS USED, WHICH AIMED AT CLARIFYING THE CONTENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ORDER TO PROPERLY APPLY IT. WHEN FORMU-LATING PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE STATE ARCHIVES WITH OB-JECTS OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS, THE METHOD OF RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS USED.SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. A LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF THE CURRENT STATE OF APPLICATION OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS LEGISLATION IN THE PRACTICE OF THE STATE ARCHIVES WAS CONDUCTED IN UKRAINE FOR THE FIRST TIME. CONCLUSIONS. RESPONSES FROM 27 INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING 5 CENTRAL ARCHIVES AND 22 STATE ARCHIVES OF REGIONS, KYIV, WERE ANALYSED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ARCHIVES' FONDS/COLLECTIONS CONTAIN A WIDE RANGE OF DOCUMENTS, WHICH, AC-CORDING TO THE LAW OF UKRAINE "ON COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS", ARE THE OBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS. IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE STATE ARCHIVES ON THE ORGANIZATION OF USE OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS, AND ACCESS TO THEM DOES NOT ALWAYS COMPLY WITH CURRENT LEGISLA-TION. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME ARCHIVES REPORTED THE FREE USE OF "ORPHAN WORKS", DESPITE THE FACT THAT UKRAINIAN LAW DOES NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDE FOR SUCH A POSSIBILITY. NOT ALL INSTITUTIONS, IN THE CASE OF A REQUEST FOR COPYING DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS, WITH EXCEPTION FOR THE CASES OF FREE USE, REQUIRE THE USER TO GIVE PERMISSION FROM THE RIGHT HOLDER TO COPY THEM, ETC. THE AUTHORS NOTE THAT CUR-RENTLY THE STATE ARCHIVES LACK A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGICAL DOCUMENT THAT WOULD COVER THE MAIN ISSUES OF APPLICATION OF COPYRIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS IN THE PRACTICE OF THE STATE ARCHIVES. SUCH A DOCUMENT WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF LAW BY ARCHIVES WHEN ORGANIZING THE USE OF DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE OBJECTS OF COPY-RIGHT AND RELATED RIGHTS, AND ACCESS TO THEM.
227	AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ARTICLE THE AUTHOR MAKES CONCLUSIONS USED AS A STARTING POINT IN FURTHER REASONING ON THE BASIS OF THE CRITICISM OF EXISTING OPINIONS ON THE NATURE OF CIVIL EQUALITY. SO, THE AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE EQUALITY OF ENTITIES IS A SPECIFIC FEATURE OF CIVIL COMMUNICATION, BUT NOT THE ACTUAL RELATIONS REGULATED BY THE CIVIL LAW NORMS. ALONG WITH ACTUAL EQUALITY, SUBJECTS OF CIVIL LEGAL RELATIONS HAVE THE AUTONOMY OF WILL AND PROPERTY INDEPENDENCE. THE RELEVANT PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROPERTY TURNOVER ARE VESTED THESE QUALITIES PRECISELY BECAUSE THE CIVIL BRANCH CONSTRUCTION IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY. GIVEN THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY PROVIDES FOR SUCCESSFUL LEGAL REGULATION OF THE QUALITY OF CIVIL LEGAL RELATIONS AS A SPECIFIC SOCIAL CONTEXT, EQUALITY OF SUBJECTS OF LAW THAT WILL NEVER ENTER INTO A CIVIL RELATIONSHIP DOES NOT MATTER IN CIVILISTIC TERMS. AFTER ALL, THEY ARE EQUAL AS SUBJECTS OF OTHER BRANCHES, WHICH, IN PARTICULAR, REVEALS A MANIFESTATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY (EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW). THEREFORE, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THOSE SUBJECTS OF CIVIL LAW THAT ARE BOUND BY SPECIFIC CIVIL LEGAL RELATIONSHIP OR INTEND TO ENTER SUCH A RELATIONSHIP. THE EQUALITY OF SUBJECTS OF CIVIL LEGAL RELATIONS MUST BE ENSURED AT ALL DYNAMIC STAGES OF THIS RELATIONSHIP, STARTING WITH ITS OCCURRENCE. THEREFORE, EQUALITY IS LAID IN THE PRE-ASSUMPTIONS OF THE CIVIL-LEGAL RELATIONS, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, LEGAL PERSONALITY AND LEGAL FACTS. HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS TO DETECT EQUALITY OF LEGAL PERSONALITIES OF ALL THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROPERTY TURNOVER ARE UNJUSTIFIED, BECAUSE ONE OF THE TASKS OF THE CIVILISTIC BRANCH IS TO CREATE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PERSONS WITH DIFFERENT LEGAL PERSONALITIES THAT ENTER LEGAL RELATIONS WILL BE IN AN EQUAL LEGAL POSITION IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, NOT IN GENERAL. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY PROVIDE A BRIEF FORMULA OF THE CIVIL LAW PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY AS THE LEADING IDEA, BY WHICH CIVIL LAW IS INTENDED TO ENSURE AND SUPPORT LEGAL EQUALITY, AUTONOMY OF WILL AND PROPERTY INDEPENDENCE OF PARTICIPANTS OF SPECIFIC CIVIL MATTERS, TO REDUCE THEREBY THEIR ACTUAL INEQUALITY THAT STEMS FROM THE LEGAL ENTITY AND (OR) SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.
228	THE SAFEGUARDING OF CIVIL LIBERTIES AND ENSURING THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INSTITUTIONS, EVEN IF PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY, ARE CRUCIAL IN A DEMOCRACY. ACCOMMODATING BOTH SECRECY (WHICH AN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (IC) NEEDS IN ORDER TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY) AND TRANSPARENCY (WHICH ENABLES CITIZENS TO KNOW WHAT THEIR GOVERNMENT IS DOING) BEGINS WITH THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THIS NOT ONLY ENSURES THAT THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS WORK EFFECTIVELY AND ARE ABLE TO ADJUST TO NEW DYNAMICS, CONCEPTS, AND TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO GUARANTEES THAT THEY RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS HUMAN LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS. A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTELLIGENCE (1) DELINEATES THE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, AND POWERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATIONS, AS WELL AS THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEIR GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY; (2) PROVIDES THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM WITH GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO; (3) INDICATES WHO IS IN CHARGE AND WHO OVERSEES THE ACTIVITY OF INTELLIGENCE; (4) ENSURES THAT THE INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS IS RESPONSIBLE BEFORE THE LAW IN CASE OF ABUSES; AND (5) MAKES SURE THAT THE IC BENEFITS FROM LEGAL PROTECTION IF IT OBSERVES THE LEGALLY AGREED GUIDANCE AND DIRECTIONS. CRAFTING A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE POST-COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES-TO EQUALLY ENFORCE BOTH EFFECTIVENESS AND DEMOCRATIC CONTROL-HAS BEEN EVEN MORE PRESSING IN AN EMERGING DEMOCRACY LIKE ROMANIA, WHOSE PREVIOUS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME (KNOWN AS THE "SECURITATE'') USED THE INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS TO OPPRESS THE POPULATION BY ROUTINELY INFRINGING UPON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES, AND WHOSE NEWLY CREATED INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES CONTINUED TO RELY ON THE EARLIER GOVERNMENT'S INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL FOR YEARS AFTER THE 1989 REGIME CHANGE. SINCE THEN, ROMANIA HAS NEVERTHELESS PROGRESSIVELY INSTITUTED A LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM, COVERING ITS MANDATE, COORDINATION, CONTROL, OVERSIGHT, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TRANSPARENCY. BUT IT HAS BEEN LESS THAN PERFECT. TODAY, TWO DECADES AFTER THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, WHEN ROMANIA IS BOTH A NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION ( NATO) AND EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MEMBER, PART OF ITS NATIONAL SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE LEGISLATION STILL DATES BACK TO THE FIRST YEARS OF TRANSITION. ALSO, PARTS OF THE LEGISLATION ARE UNCLEAR, HENCE CONDUCIVE TO INTELLIGENCE MISCHIEF AND TRANSGRESSIONS. YET, PARADOXICALLY, THE ROMANIAN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY AT BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, AND ARE UNDER DEMOCRATIC CONTROL.
229	NORMATIVITY IS CONSIDERED THE BASIS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL REGULATION. HOWEVER, THIS REGULATION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS MUST BE ORGANISED AND HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY. NORMATIVITY IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE PRIMARY, ORIGINAL PROPERTY OF SOCIAL REALITY DUE TO THE NATURAL DEMAND FOR ESTABLISHING ORDER AND ITS INTEGRAL ABILITY FOR SELF-ORGANISATION. THE INTEGRATION OF ELEMENTS INTO A BALANCED SYSTEM IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH THEIR COORDINATED INTERACTIONS, RESULTING IN SOMETHING NEW, WHICH HAS A UNIQUE INTEGRATIVE QUALITY, PROVIDED THAT THIS QUALITY WAS ABSENT BEFORE THEIR INTEGRATION INTO THE SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME, NOWADAYS, THE PHENOMENON OF NORMATIVITY IS STUDIED MOSTLY FROM TRADITIONAL POSITIONS. A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN WORKS THAT RAISE THE ISSUE OF NORMATIVITY WERE WRITTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY UNDER CONDITIONS OF AN IDEOLOGICAL MONOPOLY AND ARE UNLIKELY TO ENRICH THE MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF THE NORMATIVE NATURE OF LAW. TODAY, IN THE UKRAINIAN SCHOLARLY LITERATURE, BECAUSE OF SOVIET REMNANTS, ONLY THE FORMAL (POSITIVE-EMPIRICAL) SIDE OF NORMATIVITY IS BEING ASSESSED, WHICH LEADS TO IT BEING REPLACED BY THE CONCEPT OF STATE COERCION. IN GENERAL, THIS LEADS TO THE SPREAD AND DOMINANCE OF EXTREMELY NEGATIVE PHENOMENA IN UKRAINIAN SOCIETY, AMONG WHICH THE TOTAL NON-ENFORCEMENT OF COURT DECISIONS IS WORTH MENTIONING. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM CANNOT SIMPLY BE IMPROVING COERCIVE MEASURES OF THE STATE ALONE - THERE MUST BE CHANGES TO UNDERSTANDING THE RULE OF LAW AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE NATURE OF NORMATIVITY. THE ANALYSIS OF THE METHOD OF OBJECTIFICATION (FORMATION) OF THE DUE DILIGENCE OF LAW WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO TARGETING THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THE LATTER IS NOT SOLELY DERIVED FROM THE DICTATES OF THE STATE (OR THE EMPIRICAL PHENOMENA). HOWEVER, THE KEY FOCUS IS FINDING THE ANSWER TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OF JURISPRUDENCE AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW, NAMELY: 'WHY SHOULD A PERSON OBEY THE LAW?'. THUS, WE ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO INITIATE A PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL RETHINKING OF APPROACHES TO THE NORMATIVITY OF LAW AND THE LEGITIMATION OF STATE AND LEGAL PROCESSES. THIS ARTICLE IS AN ATTEMPT TO TARGET A DISCUSSION IN THIS SPHERE.
230	ONE FEATURE OF JUDICIAL LIFE THAT STRIKES MOST APPOINTEES TO JUDICIAL OFFICE EARLY ON IS THE SILENCE OF THE JUDICIARY OUTSIDE OUR JUDGMENTS AND STATEMENTS IN COURT. WE ARE ALSO STRUCK, WHEN WE DELIVER OUR FIRST JUDGMENT THAT RAISES CONTROVERSY OR HIGHER PUBLIC INTEREST, BY THE VULNERABILITY OF THE JUDICIARY TO CRITICISM, SOMETIMES VEHEMENT AND TRENCHANT. JUDGES DO NOT ANSWER BACK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHIEF JUSTICES, JUDGES ARE GENERALLY ONLY HEARD IN COURT, UNLESS THE SPEAKING OCCASION INVOLVES AN EXTRA-CURIAL OR ACADEMIC DISCUSSION ON THE LAW OR JUDICIAL LIFE. THIS IS PROPERLY SO. YET, WHEN THE CRITICISM COMES, IT IS TROUBLING. JUDGES UNDERSTAND THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL CONVENTIONS THAT OPERATE AND WITHIN WHICH THEY WORK. THE CONVENTIONS ARE NOT COMPLICATED, IN FACT QUITE SIMPLE. THE ONLY REGRET IS THAT THEY ARE FORGOTTEN OR OVERLOOKED WHEN THE CRITICISM IS MADE. FOR THIS EVENING'S PURPOSE I WOULD WISH TO REFLECT ON THE CONVENTIONS THAT JUDGES WORK WITHIN. I WILL SET OUT THE TRADITIONAL AND MODERN VIEWS ON PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY. I WILL ADDRESS THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL POWER. I WILL POSTULATE THAT, IN MODERN GOVERNMENT, IT IS THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS SOVEREIGN. I WILL CONSIDER THE JUDICIAL ROLE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMON LAW. I WILL ADDRESS THE TOPICS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM, THE ELECTION OF JUDGES AND JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY. I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE VIEW THAT THE COMPLAINT OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM IS MISPLACED AND INVOLVES A MISAPPREHENSION OF THE JUDICIAL FUNCTION. FOR SOME, THE HIGH WATER MARK OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM WAS MABO. 1 FOR SOME, THE NADIR OF JUDICIAL 'INACTIVISM' WAS AL KATEB.(2) THESE SWINGS OF THE PENDULUM IN THE DISCUSSION OF JUDGES' WORK ARE NOT NEW. IN 1956, BOILERMAKERS'(3) WAS AN UNSATISFACTORY OUTCOME FOR SOME. SIMILARLY, IN 1948, THE BANK NATIONALISATION(4) DECISION PROVOKED CRITICISM. WHEN CHIEF JUSTICE DIXON RESTRAINED THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT FROM CARRYING OUT THE EXECUTION IN TAIT,(5) CRITICISM ENSUED. HOWEVER, EACH TIME JUDICIAL POWER PREVAILED OVER PARLIAMENTARY AND EXECUTIVE POWER. WAS THAT UNDEMOCRATIC? MY DISCUSSION DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING NEW. IT HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE. BUT, IT NEEDS TO BE SAID AGAIN. I TURN THEN TO THE TOPIC FOR CONSIDERATION.
231	PURPOSETHE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER CAPITAL STRUCTURE AFFECTS ACCRUALS AND REAL EARNINGS MANAGEMENT (AEM AND REM) OF NONFINANCIAL FIRMS LISTED ON PAKISTAN STOCK EXCHANGE (PSX). MOREOVER, TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ID) MODERATES THE RELATION BETWEEN CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND EARNINGS MANAGEMENT (EM). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHDATA WERE TAKEN FROM ANNUAL REPORTS OF NONFINANCIAL FIRMS LISTED ON THE PSX DURING 2012-2019. DATA OF 150 FIRMS FOR A PERIOD OF EIGHT YEARS WERE FOUND COMPLETED WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIABLES USED IN THIS STUDY. THE GENERALIZED MOMENTS OF METHODS ESTIMATOR IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF EXPLANATORY VARIABLES ON EARNING MANAGEMENT. FURTHERMORE, FIXED AND RANDOM EFFECTS METHODS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON AEM AND REM. FINDINGSRESULTS SHOW THAT ALL THREE MEASURES OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE (I.E. TOTAL DEBT RATIO, LONG-TERM DEBT RATIO AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATIOS) ARE INVERSELY RELATED TO AEM. IN CONTRAST, ALL MEASURES OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO ABNORMAL CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. TOTAL DEBT RATIO AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATIO ARE NEGATIVELY WHILE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATIO IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO ABNORMAL DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES. TOTAL DEBT RATIO AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATIO ARE SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVELY RELATED TO ABNORMAL PRODUCTION COST. ADDITIONALLY, INTERACTION TERMS OF ID (I.E. RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY) SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATE THE CONTROLLING ROLE OF DEBT ON DISCRETIONARY ACCRUALS. IN SUM, RESULTS SHOW THAT THE USE OF DEBT INDUCES LENDER'S MONITORING. CONSEQUENTLY, MANAGERS MOVE TOWARD REM BECAUSE OF LOWER PROBABILITY OF BEING EXPOSED. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSFINDINGS OF THIS STUDY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGERS AND REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. FOR INSTANCE, THE USE OF DEBT INCREASES THE LENDER'S INFLUENCE WHICH RESTRICTS THE MANAGERS TO BE INVOLVED IN EM PRACTICES. MOREOVER, REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THE LOOPHOLES IN REGULATIONS TO REFRAIN THE MANAGERS TO BE ENGAGED IN EM. ORIGINALITY/VALUETO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY IN PAKISTAN THAT HAS EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON AEM AND REM. MORE IMPORTANTLY, A CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AFFIRMS THAT THIS STUDY IS AMONG THE FEW STUDIES THAT HAVE USED ID AS A MODERATING VARIABLE TO EXPLAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND EM.
232	THE POLICY OF THE COMMUNIST AUTHORITIES TOWARDS WRITERS AND ARTISTS IN THE 1945 TO 1989 PERIOD CAN BE DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL STAGES. THE FIRST LASTED FROM THE END OF 1944 TO NOVEMBER 1947. THE SECOND STAGE LASTED FROM NOVEMBER 1947 UNTIL THE END OF 1949, WHEN SOCIALIST REALISM WAS FORCIBLY INTRODUCED INTO ALL AREAS OF CULTURAL LIFE. THE THIRD STAGE ENDED AT THE BEGINNING OF 1955, WHEN ONE COULD OBSERVE A WEAKENING OF THE AUTHORITIES (ACCUSED OF VIOLATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW). THE WHOLE YEAR 1955 AND THE TURN OF 1956/ 1957 IS REFERRED TO AS THE "THAW" PERIOD. DURING WLADYSLAW GOMULKA'S ERA (OCTOBER 1956 DECEMBER 1970), THE ATTITUDE ADOPTED BY THE AUTHORITIES TOWARDS ARTISTS REMAINED MOSTLY UNCHANGED. IT MANIFESTED ITSELF AS AN IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE AND REPRESSION OF ANY EMERGING SIGNS OF RESISTANCE IN THAT COMMUNITY. WHEN EDWARD GIEREK WAS IN POWER AS THE FIRST SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE POLISH UNITED WORKERS' PARTY (1970-1980), THE POLICY TOWARDS WRITERS AND ARTISTS EVOLVED IN TWO STAGES. THE FIRST (1971-1976) WAS CHARACTERIZED BY LIBERALISM AND PRAGMATISM, AS PART OF A REGIME'S LEGITIMIZATION STRATEGY. DURING THE SECOND STAGE, LASTING FROM FEBRUARY 1976 TO AUGUST 1980, PREVENTIVE AND REPRESSIVE ELEMENTS BEGAN TO PREVAIL IN THE POSITION TAKEN TOWARDS ARTISTS, WHO INCREASINGLY VOICED OPPOSITION TOWARDS THE AUTHORITIES.OPPOSITION WAS TO BE QUASHED BY MORE STRINGENT CENSORSHIP, NUMEROUS SEARCHES, INTERROGATION OF ARTISTS AND HARASSMENT. IN 1980 AND 1981, THE AUTHORITIES CONCENTRATED ON ENSURING THAT THE MANAGING BODIES OF THE ARTIST/WRITER ASSOCIATIONS HAD THE RIGHT POLITICAL CREDENTIALS, ALTHOUGH WITH NO EFFECT. THEY SUPPORTED ARTISTS WITH COMMUNIST PARTY AFFILIATIONS AND UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO ATTRACT THE NEUTRAL CENTRE AND TO EXPLOIT IT. DURING THE MARTIAL LAW PERIOD, THE AUTHORITIES ADOPTED A REPRESSIVE POLICY TOWARDS ARTISTS, BUT THEY FAILED TO PUT AN END TO THEIR BOYCOTT OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THE ATTEMPT TO USE ARTISTS TO LEGITIMIZE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE AUTHORITIES IN THE PERESTROIKA PERIOD WAS ONLY PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL. FINALLY, THE CULTURAL POLICY OF THE AUTHORITIES WAS PUT ASIDE ALTOGETHER AFTER THE POLITICAL CHANGES OF 1989.
233	THE GAMBIA, THE SMALLEST STATE IN CONTINENTAL AFRICA, HAS BEEN UNDERGOING A THROUGH TRANSFORMATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2017. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF A CHANGE IN MANY YEARS' RULE, INITIALLY OF PRESIDENT DAWDA JAWARA (24 YEARS) AND THEN YAHYA JAMMEH (22 YEARS), AND THE TAKE-OVER OF POWER BY ADAMA BARROW. THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT, WHO HAS BEEN HOLDING THE POSITION FOR FIVE YEARS, BEARING IN MIND NUMEROUS PROBLEMS RESULTING FROM THE HERITAGE OF HIS PREDECESSORS, AMONG OTHERS ABUSE OF POWER, IGNORANCE FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES, FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE RULE OF LAW AND VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, HAS SET A GOAL FOR HIMSELF AND HIS ASSOCIATES TO PREPARE A STRATEGY FOR THE REPAIR AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE, WHICH COULD GUARANTEE THAT THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA TRANSFORMS INTO A STATE WITH DEMOCRATIC FOUNDATIONS, ENSURING SAFETY AND PROSPERITY TO ALL ITS CITIZENS. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SUCH A SHORT TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW POLICY CANNOT PRODUCE SPECTACULAR SUCCESSES, YET THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO PRESENT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF BARROW'S PRESIDENCY. IT IS AN ATTEMPT AT ANSWERING QUESTIONS AS TO WHICH OF THE ASSUMED GOALS SHOW ANY PROGRESS AND WHICH STILL REMAIN IN THE SPHERE OF THE NEW PRESIDENT'S UNRE-ALISED ASPIRATIONS. IN THE TEXT BELOW, THE AUTHOR PRIMARILY USES THREE RESEARCH METHODS. THE TASK OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL METHOD IS TO ANALYSE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE GAMBIA (REASONABILITY OF THE ADOPTED STRATEGIES, VERIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF STATE INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE CITIZENS; ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF ADOPTED PREMISES; ANALYSIS OF IMPACT OF QUALITY OF THE STATE INSTITUTIONS ON THE EFFICIENT OR INEFFICIENT FUNCTIONING OF THE STATE). THE SYSTEM METHOD IS USED TO ANALYSE A GROUP OF ELEMENTS, I.E., THE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN THE STATE, THE RELATIONS OF SUCH ELEMENTS (AUTHORITIES, OFFICES, PARTIES, ETC.) AND THEIR RECIPROCAL IMPACT, AS WELL AS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOUR (LEVEL OF RESIDENTS' LIFE, OBSERVANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEGREE OF CIVIL SOCIETY). IN TURN, THE METHOD OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IS USED TO COMPARE THE STATISTICAL DATA PREPARED REGULARLY BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ASSESS THE LEVEL OF A STATE'S CORRECT OPERATION.
234	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF LAWYERS IN AFRICA, USING ZAMBIA AS A CASE STUDY. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON INFORMATION FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING FIELD INTERVIEWS, SURVEY DATA, AND CASE DATA FROM ZAMBIAN COURTS, IN ADDITION TO SECONDARY-SOURCE MATERIAL. THOUGH OTHER WORK HAS DEALT WITH ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN AFRICA BROADLY AND WITH ISSUES THAT AFFECT ACCESS TO JUSTICE, INCLUDING AFRICAN LEGAL EDUCATION, PRISON CONDITIONS, AND ALTERNATIVES TO FORMAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION, THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF THE SCARCITY OF AFRICAN LAWYERS, THE EFFECTS OF THE SHORTAGE, AND POTENTIAL AVENUES FOR ADDRESSING THE CRISIS, INCLUDING MEASURES FOR MAKING MORE EFFICIENT USE OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LEGAL RESOURCES AND REFORMS TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE AFRICAN BAR. NOW, BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME SCARCITY OF AFRICAN LAWYERS, MOST CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS GO WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, AND MOST AFRICANS WITH CIVIL CLAIMS HAVE NO REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF HIRING A LAWYER. THE CAUSES OF THIS CRISIS DATE TO COLONIAL POLICIES THAT DISCOURAGED HIGHER EDUCATION FOR NATIVE AFRICANS. MORE RECENTLY, DONOR FATIGUE AND THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC RESOURCES FOR EDUCATION, COMPOUNDED BY WORLD BANK AND IMF AUSTERITY MEASURES, HAVE PERPETUATED THE PROBLEM. LIKEWISE, POOR POLICY CHOICES AT AFRICAN LAW SCHOOLS AND AFRICAN BAR ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS HAVE EXACERBATED THE DILEMMA. ZAMBIA, AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, COULD ENHANCE THE IMPACT OF THEIR LIMITED LEGAL COMMUNITIES BY ALLOWING THE USE OF CONTINGENCY FEES, REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE CIVIL CASELOADS OF OVERBURDENED AND UNDERSTAFFED LEGAL AID DEPARTMENTS, AND MAKING MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF PARALEGALS. AFRICAN LAW SCHOOLS COULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR GRADUATES BY IMPLEMENTING POLICIES TO COMBAT RAMPANT DERELICTION OF DUTY BY THEIR FACULTIES, PEDAGOGICAL REFORMS, AND POLICIES TO INCREASE STUDENT ACCESS TO LEARNING MATERIALS. ADDITIONALLY, LOW BAR PASS RATES WOULD LIKELY IMPROVE IF BAR ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS REFORMED THEIR CURRICULA, CHANGED HIRING PRACTICES, AND IMPLEMENTED TRANSPARENT GRADING PRACTICES. ULTIMATELY, GROWTH OF THE AFRICAN BAR IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURING ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS OF THE RIGHTS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS, LITIGATING COMPLEX CIVIL CLAIMS, NEGOTIATING THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE COMPETING TRADITIONS OF THE DUAL LEGAL SYSTEMS OF MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES, AND BUILDING AND SUSTAINING SOCIETIES SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW.
235	THE PRESENT ARTICLE IS FOCUSED ON THE LIMITS OF STALIN'S DICTATORSHIP. THIS PROBLEM IS CONSIDERED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A GENERAL DISCUSSION BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF THE TOTALITARIAN AND REVISIONIST HISTORICAL SCHOOLS. IT IS SHOWED HOW DIFFERENT REGIONAL POWER STRUCTURES INTERPRETED CENTRAL DECISIONS REGULATING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE OF THE SPECIAL SETTLERS. THE CONFLICTS GENERATED BY THESE DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATIONS ARE ANALYZED, AND THE MECHANISMS OF THEIR RESOLUTION ARE EXPLORED. BASED ON THIS, IT IS DEMONSTRATED HOW THESE CONFLICTS DEFUSED THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND ADAPTED UNWIELDY ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM TO THE NEEDS OF THE SOVIET SOCIETY. THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE PARTY AND THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THREE LEVELS (DISTRICT - REGION - CENTER) IS USED AS THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF THIS ARTICLE. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THREE PARTICULAR EXAMPLES OCCURRED IN THE LATE 1940S - EARLY 1950S IN THE TOMSK AND NOVOSIBIRSK REGIONS. EACH OF THE CONSIDERED CASES ILLUSTRATES CONTRADICTIONS EXISTED WITHIN THE POWER STRUCTURE (THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS, THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY, PARTY, COURT, PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE) AND SHOWS THAT SOME DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES DID NOT AROUSE SUFFICIENT ENTHUSIASM AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE STALIN'S SYSTEM. THE FIRST EXAMPLE REFLECTS THE PROBLEM OF PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF LEGISLATION AIMED AT PREVENTING ESCAPES FROM SPECIAL SETTLEMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE DECREE OF NOVEMBER 26, 1948. THE SECOND CASE DEMONSTRATES THE REACTIONS OF VARIOUS POWER STRUCTURES TO UNAUTHORIZED MIGRATIONS OF SPECIAL SETTLERS. THE THIRD EXAMPLE IS RELATED TO THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE DISMISSAL OF DEPORTED PEOPLE IN 1948/1949. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS NO SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE LEGALITY OF THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPERVISORY AUTHORITIES IN THE STALIN'S DICTATORSHIP. NEVERTHELESS, SOME DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES WERE CORRECTED. IT WAS RELATED TO BOTH THE INTERVENTION OF OTHER AUTHORITIES AND THE PRESENCE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY OF THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT EXPEDIENCY, JUSTICE AND LEGALITY. IN ADDITION, THE STALIN'S SYSTEM IS CONSIDERED AS A "STAGING DICTATORSHIP" (MALTE ROLF'S CONCEPT) IN THIS ARTICLE, SINCE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES WERE CARRIED OUT IN PARALLEL WITH THE CREATION OF THE IMAGE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE NEED TO MAINTAIN THIS IMAGE REPRESENTS ANOTHER LIMITATION OF THE STALIN'S DICTATORSHIP.
236	THE IMPACT OF LEGAL POLICY REFORMS TO DRAFT LEGISLATION HAS BEEN A RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED FIELD IN THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW STUDIES. IN ESTONIA, AS IN OTHER EUROPEAN UNION AND OECD COUNTRIES, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INFORMATION ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, SECURITY, ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUDGETARY IMPACTS OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION HAS TO BE GIVEN IN AN EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM OF THE DRAFT ACT TO FACILITATE THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED AND TRANSPARENT RESOLUTIONS OF POLICY CONTROVERSIES. IN 1997, THE AUTHOR DESIGNED A METHOD FOR NORMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF EXPLANATORY MEMORANDA ON THE BASIS OF ESTONIAN LEGAL RULES FOR THE DRAFT LEGISLATION (1996), OECD REGULATORY REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS (1997) AND MULTIPLE ACADEMIC SOURCES TO EXPLAIN THE GAP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND SOCIAL FACTS IN DRAFT LEGISLATION. THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK WAS DESIGNED FOR THE PARLIAMENTARY CONTEXT INVOLVING DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE, THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS, BETTER REGULATION AND OTHER CONCEPTS. THE INITIAL AIM WAS TO GAIN AN EMPIRICAL OVERVIEW OF THE EXTENT THAT THE INITIATORS OF DRAFT ACTS FOLLOW THE LAW-MAKING RULES IN INFORMATION CATEGORIES OF IMPACT ASSESSMENTS, RESEARCH REFERENCES, AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. IN 1998-2009 SEVEN FOLLOW-UP STUDIES AND SEVERAL QUALITATIVE CASE STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT, WHICH INDICATED THE MIMETIC APPLICATION OF BETTER REGULATION PRINCIPLES. IN 2011, THE ESTONIAN GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT TOOK A STEP CLOSER TO THE LEADING OECD COUNTRIES LAUNCHING THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR LEGAL POLICY UNTIL 2018. THE LATEST FOLLOW-UP STUDY PROCEEDS FROM A HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS POLICY REFORM HAS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE WORK ROUTINES OF MINISTRIES. IN ADDITION TO THE NORMATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF EXPLANATORY MEMORANDA OF DRAFT ACTS (2012-2015), THE RESULTS OF CIVIL SERVANTS' ESURVEY (2011; 2015) AND SOME INSIDER' OBSERVATIONS FROM DIFFERENT MINISTRIES WILL BE PRESENTED. THE STUDIES SHOW MANY POSITIVE STRUCTURAL CHANGES FROM 2007-2017; HOWEVER, THE GAP BETWEEN NORMATIVELY REQUIRED AND FACTUALLY PRESENTED SOCIO-LEGAL INFORMATION IS STILL REMARKABLE. THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF BETTER REGULATION CONCEPTS INTO THE RELATIVELY SMALL ESTONIAN GOVERNANCE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THE POST-SOVIET TRANSITION PERIOD SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS FINISHED SINCE 2010. THIS ARTICLE SUPPORTS THIS CONCLUSION, PARTIALLY DEMONSTRATING THAT MANY PRECONDITIONS FOR THE DELIBERATIVE KNOWLEDGE-BASED LEGAL POLICY ARE NOT COMPLETED - THE INSTITUTION-BUILDING MUST GO ON.
237	I RESPOND TO A BROAD RANGE OF CHALLENGES THAT THE SEVEN ARTICLES OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE RAISE FOR THE THEORY OF A HUMAN RIGHTS STATE. THE FIRST TWO ARTICLES ADDRESS THE THEORY AS A WHOLE. THE FIRST RECONFIGURES THE HUMAN RIGHTS STATE AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL FOR MEASURING IMPLEMENTATION. I COUNTER THAT SUCH MEASUREMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT NORMATIVE INTERPRETATION. THE SECOND ARTICLE INSISTS THAT ANY HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT CAN ONLY BE VALID IF VALID TRANSCENDENTALLY. BY CONTRAST, I ADVOCATE VALIDITY AS A THIS-WORLDLY PROJECT UNDERTAKEN BY THE ADDRESSEES THEMSELVES. THE NEXT THREE ARTICLES EXAMINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MODEL IS DEPLOYED EMPIRICALLY. ONE IMAGINES A MEXICAN HUMAN RIGHTS STATE FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES THAT WOULD DEVELOP LOCAL STRUCTURES OF AUTONOMY AND SELF-GOVERNANCE. WHILE THE AUTHOR PROPOSES COMMUNAL AGENCY AND CULTURAL UNITY, I DISCUSS THE DANGER THAT COLLECTIVE RIGHTS POSE TO THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. ANOTHER ARTICLE SKETCHES A BRAZILIAN HUMAN RIGHTS STATE THAT WOULD DIMINISH SOCIAL AUTHORITARIANISM, INCORPORATE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW WITHIN THE STATE, AND TRANSFORM AN AUTHORITARIAN CULTURE. BUT IF THE HUMAN RIGHTS IN QUESTION ARE SELF-AUTHORED, AS I ADVOCATE, THEN THEY ARE NOT GIFTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS THE AUTHOR ASSERTS. THE LAST OF THIS SET DESCRIBES A BOSNIAN-HERZEGOVINIAN HUMAN RIGHTS STATE THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE ETHNIC INSTRUMENTALISATION OF RELIGION. BUT THE COMMON ETHOS SOUGHT BY THIS MODEL IS ITSELF OPEN TO MANIPULATION AND COULD UNDERMINE INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY. THE FINAL TWO ARTICLES PROBE THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORAL UNIVERSALISM THAT BOTH REGARD AS SIMPLY GIVEN. ONE CHAMPIONS A HUMAN RIGHT TO DEMOCRACY AND FINDS THAT RIGHT EMBEDDED IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS. I CONTEND THAT THE RULE OF LAW, MORE SO THAN DEMOCRACY, FACILITATES THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECT. THE OTHER ARTICLE DRAWS ON A HUMAN RIGHTS COGNITIVE STYLE YET REJECTS WHAT, GIVEN THE PRACTICAL IMPERATIVE OF LOCALISM, I ARGUE IS KEY TO THAT APPROACH: MORAL RELATIVISM. I CONCLUDE BY SKETCHING THE VARIETY OF FUTURE RESEARCH PROGRAMMES ON THE IDEA AND PRACTICE OF A HUMAN RIGHTS STATE THAT FLOW FROM THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SPECIAL ISSUE.
238	IN THE EARLY 20(TH) CENTURY, ZEMSTVOS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FATE OF THE STATE THROUGH ELECTIONS TO THE STATE DUMA AND THE STATE COUNCIL. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS WAS ALREADY NOTED BY CONTEMPORARIES OF THE POLITICAL REFORMS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE 19(TH) - EARLY 20(TH) CENTURIES. ZEMSTVO INSTITUTIONS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS SOCIAL ELEVATORS FOR THE TRANSITION TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. PREVIOUSLY, THERE WAS NO STRICT CRITERION IN HISTORIOGRAPHY FOR ASSESSING THE REPRESENTATION OF DEPUTIES FROM THE ZEMSTVO ENVIRONMENT AND STUDYING THEIR ACTIVITIES IN PARLIAMENT. THE AUTHORS DISCOVERED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE COUNCIL WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ZEMSTVOS, BUT THEY SUPPORTED IMPERIAL POWER IN MAKING POLITICAL DECISIONS. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF ZEMSTVO DEPUTIES IN THE STATE DUMA GRADUALLY INCREASED, LEADING TO A CLEAR "ZEMSTVO FACE" IN THE 3(RD) AND 4(TH) CONVOCATIONS. THE MOST COMMON CHANNEL OF MOBILITY WAS THROUGH ELECTIONS TO THE STATE DUMA WITH THE STATUS OF A GLASNYJ OF PROVINCIAL ZEMSTVO. MOST DEPUTIES WERE ELECTED FROM PROVINCES WHERE LAND MANAGEMENT, MODERNIZATION, AND MOVEMENT TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW WAS ACTIVELY BEING PURSUED. WHILE THERE WAS SUCCESSFUL MOBILITY BETWEEN THE ZEMSTVO AND PARLIAMENT IN THE 1(ST) AND 2(ND) CONVOCATIONS, ZEMSTVO REPRESENTATIVES BECAME LESS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AS THE PARLIAMENT EVOLVED. BY THE 4(TH) CONVOCATION, THE PARLIAMENTARY SUB-ELITE HAD RISEN TO LEADING POSITIONS IN THE STATE DUMA. THE AUTHORS PROPOSE A SOLUTION TO THE QUESTION OF THE CONTINUITY AND THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EVOLUTIONARY PATH OF DEVELOPMENT IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY OF THE IMPERIAL PERIOD. THE PAPER ADDRESSES THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING ZEMSTVOS INTO "PARLIAMENTARY COURSES" AND THE BASIS FOR ALL-RUSSIAN REPRESENTATION. THE AUTHORS STATE THAT NEITHER PARLIAMENT NOR ZEMSTVOS HAD THE NECESSARY FULLNESS OF STATE POWER. THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT DID NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND LED TO A CRISIS OF POWER. ALTHOUGH ZEMSTVO AND PARLIAMENTARY REFORMS OPENED UP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY PATH OF SOCIOCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION AND POLITICAL MODERNIZATION, THEY WERE ULTIMATELY LOST.
239	IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE APPLY IN NEARLY ALL OF ITS STAGES. ACCORDING TO THIS CRITERION, IT IS PROPOSED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PRINCIPLES AND LESS IMPORTANT PROVISIONS THAT CAN NOT RELATE TO THEM. HOWEVER, SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE RELATIONS DEVELOPING ON VARIOUS STAGES OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, FORCES THE AUTHOR TO QUESTION THE CORRECTNESS OF THE CRITERION PROPOSED IN SCIENCE, BECAUSE MOST OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE DESIGNATED BY A LEGISLATOR SIMPLY ARE NOT ABLE TO INFLUENCE ALL STAGES OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. IN CHAPTER 2 OF THE CODE CAN BE IDENTIFIED ONLY A FEW PROVISIONS OF THE UNIVERSAL NATURE, WHICH ARE USED IN ALL STAGES OF THE PROCESS. THESE MAY INCLUDE: RULE OF LAW, THE RIGHT TO APPEAL PROCEDURAL ACTIONS AND DECISIONS, AS WELL AS PROVISIONS TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. BUT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS NOT ADDRESSED ALL STAGES OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND IS ABLE TO INFLU-ENCE, IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE TRIAL STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, IN PART - TO THE STAGE OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION. THUS, THE STAGE OF LAYING AN ACTION OF CRIMINAL CASE DO NOT APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PARTIES, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SUSPECT (ACCUSED) IS NOT FORMED BY HAND, NOT WORDED ACCUSATION. IN THE PRELIMINARY INQUIRY STAGE, WHERE THERE IS NO NEUTRAL ARBITER - THE COURT, THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE PARTIES PRINCIPLE IS IMPLEMENTED ONLY PARTIALLY, DUE TO CERTAIN PRIVILEGES GRANTED BY THE DEFENSE. THE ACTION OF THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE BEGINS AFTER THE FIGURES SUSPECT (ACCUSED) AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BEGINNING OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. THE FULL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IMPLEMENTED IN THE TRIAL STAGE, WHEN DECIDING THE INNOCENCE OR GUILT OF THE DEFENDANT TO THE CRIME. AFTER THE VERDICT INTO FORCE OF THE PRINCIPLES WILL BE GREATLY LIMITED. STAGE OF ENFORCEMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, DOES NOT INVOLVE FURTHER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OR REVIEW OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS. AND IN THE STAGES OF APPEAL, APPEAL OR REVIEW PROCEEDINGS, WHERE THE VERIFICATION OF THE LEGALITY, VALIDITY AND FAIRNESS OF COURT DECISIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR ENTRY INTO FORCE, THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCESS CAN NOT BE IMPLEMENTED IN FULL.
240	WE HAVE ANALYZED THE INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF LOCAL CURRENCY (LCY) CORPORATE BOND MARKETS DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD OF 2010-2016 ON A CROSS-COUNTRY SAMPLE. WE HAVE CONSIDERED A WIDE RANGE OF INDICATORS OF THE QUALITY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION'S INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, THE WORLD BANK'S INDICATORS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM'S INDICATORS OF CORPORATE CULTURE, THE DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION OF FINANCIAL MARKETS. UNLIKE MOST PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE HAVE TESTED NOT ONLY STATIC REGRESSION MODELS (MULTIFACTOR LINEAR REGRESSIONS) BUT ALSO DYNAMIC MODELS BASED ON THE GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS (GMM), WHICH ALLOWS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ENDOGENEITY OF VARIABLES. THE SAMPLE CONSISTS OF 420 QUARTERLY OBSERVATIONS ON 15 EMERGING MARKETS, WHICH WERE THE LEADERS BY THE ISSUANCE VOLUME OF CORPORATE BONDS IN THE PRE-CRISIS 2013. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LOW QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF THE SHARE OF LCY CORPORATE BONDS IN THE TOTAL ISSUANCE VOLUME. IN THE PERIODS OF INSTABILITY, LOCAL CURRENCY CORPORATE BONDS BECOME LESS ATTRACTIVE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS, THEREFORE, ISSUERS ARE FORCED TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET, I.E. TO REALIZE THE IMPORT SUBSTITUTION OF CAPITAL. WE RANK FACTORS BY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE EXPLAINED VARIABLE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC MODEL SPECIFICATIONS ARE THE WORLD BANK'S INDICATORS OF REGULATORY QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW. A DECLINE IN SOVEREIGN CREDIT RATINGS ALSO GIVES IMPETUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LCY CORPORATE BOND MARKETS. THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH SHOW THAT MORE DEVELOPED STOCK MARKETS SUPPRESS THE GROWTH OF LCY CORPORATE BOND MARKETS: EQUITY CORPORATE BONDS ARE COMPETING FINANCING SOURCES FOR COMPANIES FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ON THE CONTRARY, A DEVELOPED BANKING SECTOR CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWTH OF THE LCY CORPORATE BOND MARKET: BANKS ACT AS DEALERS AND MARKET MAKERS. THE DEVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL CURRENCY HAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE EXPLAINED VARIABLE AMONG OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THAT IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF DEBT DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY.
241	INTRODUCTION: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE IN TANZANIA IS PROVIDED AT TWO TYPES OF HEALTH UNITS, THE DISPENSARY AND THE HEALTH CENTRE. THEORETICALLY, PRIMARY HEALTH WORKERS (WITH KNOWLEDGE OF PRIMARY EYE CARE [PEC]) ARE IDEALLY PLACED TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED OF EYE CARE SERVICES. IN TANZANIA, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY, TREAT, OR CORRECTLY REFER A NUMBER OF EYE CONDITIONS INCLUDING CATARACT, TRAUMA, PRESBYOPIA, AND THE 'RED EYE'. THEY ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE VISUAL ACUITY CORRECTLY AND TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT PREVENTION. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ENHANCED SUPERVISION OF HEALTH WORKERS ON PEC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN KILIMANJARO REGION, TANZANIA. STUDY DESIGN: THIS WAS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, CLUSTER RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION STUDY OF AN ENHANCED SUPERVISORY METHOD COMPARED TO A ROUTINE SUPERVISORY METHOD; 36 DISPENSARIES WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO THE TWO GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS: HEALTH WORKERS BASED AT GOVERNMENT DISPENSARIES IN MWANGA DISTRICT. DATA COLLECTION: PARTICIPANTS WERE INTERVIEWED PRE AND POST INTERVENTION AND THE INFORMATION WAS RECORDED USING A STANDARDIZED PRETESTED QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: MEAN SCORES OF KNOWLEDGE IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS WAS HIGHER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP (SCORE 6.43, 80.4% IMPROVEMENT) COMPARED TO THE NON-INTERVENTION GROUP (SCORE = 4.71, 58.9% IMPROVEMENT). THE ABILITY TO DESCRIBE AND DEMONSTRATE VISION TESTING WAS BETTER (SCORE = 1.8) IN THE ENHANCED SUPERVISION GROUP COMPARED TO THE ROUTINE SUPERVISION GROUP (SCORE - 0.88, P = 0.03). THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL OF ATTRITION (24%) WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE TIME OF BASELINE SURVEY, ESPECIALLY AMONGST CLINICAL OFFICERS (44%). CONCLUSION: DURING THE PILOT STUDY, ENHANCED SUPERVISION IMPROVED PEC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF HEALTH WORKERS COMPARED TO HEALTH WORKERS WITH ROUTINE SUPERVISION. RECOMMENDATIONS: TRAINING IN PEC NEEDS REVISION TO BECOME MORE PRACTICUM-BASED. THERE IS NEED TO REVISE SUPERVISION GUIDELINES (TO BE SKILLS-BASED) AND THE SUPERVISION SKILLS OF DISTRICT EYE COORDINATORS (DECS) NEED TO BE ENHANCED. THERE IS A HUGE NEED TO IMPROVE GOVERNANCE (ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW) OF HEALTH STAFF. (C) 2013 THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
242	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE 'TOTAL DEFENSE >> CONCEPT CONSIDERING IT TO BE PART OF SWE-DEN'S STRATEGIC CULTURE AND PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THIS CONCEPT DEFINES SWEDEN'S AP-PROACH TOWARDS THE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITHIN THE EU. 'TOTAL DEFENCE >> REMAINS STAPLE IN THE SWEDISH DEFENCE PLANNING AND THE PERCEPTION OF RISKS TO NATIONAL SECURITY, BUT HAS NOT YET RECEIVED SUFFICIENT ATTENTION FROM RUSSIAN RESEARCHERS. THE ANNOUNCED RESTORATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TOTAL DEFENSE SYSTEM POTENTIALLY COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE PERIOD OF BIPOLAR CON-FRONTATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES DUE TO THE GRADUAL REDUCTION IN DEFENSE SPENDING AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR AND THE DECENTRALIZATION OF THE NATIONAL CRISIS PREPAR-EDNESS STRUCTURES WHICH WAS INITIATED IN THE EARLY 2000S. THE TOTAL DEFENSE ITSELF ALSO REVEALS TENSIONS BETWEEN THE DEMANDS FOR CONSOLIDATION AND CENTRALIZED DECISION-MAKING AND THE LIBERAL, OPEN NATURE OF THE SWEDISH SOCIETY AND NATIONAL ECONOMY, AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLES OF RESPONSIBILITY, SUBSIDIARITY AND SIMILARITY THAT UNDERLINE THE PRESENT SWEDISH EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. THE TOTAL DEFENSE, IS, THEREFORE, REGARDED AS AN ATTEMPT AT CREATING AN EF-FECTIVE CRISIS PREPAREDNESS SYSTEM THAT WOULD FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, BOTH UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE AND POTENTIAL ARMED CONFLICT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO DE-CLARE AN EMERGENCY AND ENDOW INDIVIDUAL BODIES OR A SELECTED GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EXCLUSIVE POWERS. THE SWEDISH STRATEGIC CULTURE, THEREFORE, STIPULATES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO RESOLVE A CRISIS EFFECTIVELY, BUT ALSO TO DO SO IN A WAY WHICH WOULD NOT ENDANGER THE REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. WITHIN THE EU SWEDEN HAS EARNED CREDIT FOR DEVELOPING CIVILIAN OR NON-MILITARY ELEMENTS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT, WHILE 'MORE HARDWARE >> DEFENSE COOPERATION WITHIN PESCO AND THE EUROPEAN DEFENSE FUND IS DEFINED BY THE PRAGMATIC ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF SWEDISH DEFENSE COMPANIES RATHER THAN BY STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS. THE SWEDISH EXPERIENCE WITH 'TOTAL DEFENCE >> WILL CONTINUE TO FACE THE SAME DILEMMA - THE NEED TO REBUILD A ROBUST AND SELF-RELIANT NATIONAL DEFENCE WHILE PRESERVING THE LIBERAL PRINCIPLES IN POLITICS AS WELL AS IN ECONOMY.
243	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO MODERN TENDENCIES OF DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE AND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. MODERN STRATEGIC APPROACHES TO THE USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITY OF TEACHERS ARE PRESENTED, WHICH SUPPORT A NEW LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION OF ALL PARTICIPANTS OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, AS WELL AS AT DEVELOPING THE DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF THE TEACHER HIMSELF. THE DEFINITION OF "DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP" IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT IS PRESENTED. IT CONSISTS OF THE ABILITY OF A PERSON TO PARTICIPATE POSITIVELY, CRITICALLY AND COMPETITIVELY IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT, BASED ON SKILLS OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPPOSES THE PRACTICE OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION WITH THE RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY THROUGH RESPONSIBLE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPONENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP ARE REVEALED. IT IS PRESENTED IN THE THREE OF ITS KEY ELEMENTS: DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT, DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY AND DIGITAL PARTICIPATION. THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN THE EXERCISE OF DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP ARE OUTLINED. THE VISION OF THE TEACHER'S DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS PRESENTED AND ITS ROLE IN DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP IS OUTLINED. THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S VISION ON DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IS PRESENTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EMPOWER YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO ACQUIRE COMPETENCES FOR LEARNING AND ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE DIGITAL SOCIETY. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL CIVIC EDUCATION IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE TO DEVELOP DIGITAL SKILLS AND USE THEM IN THE INTERNET, WHICH INVOLVES PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT AND CREATIVITY, AS WELL AS AWARENESS OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ONLINE ACTIVITIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND COMPETENCES FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IS EMPHASIZED FOR THE EXERCISE AND UPHOLDING OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE INTERNET, AS WELL AS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN CYBERSPACE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO ADAPT TOOLS USING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO EDUCATE THE AUDIENCE. THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING TEACHER-CENTERED ONLINE TOOLS VERSATILE AND PROVIDING FEEDBACK, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN ICT USE, AS WELL AS ON FINDING THEIR OWN PATHS TO SUCCESS IS EMPHASIZED.
244	THE PAPER IS DEVOTED TO WAYS AND MEANS OF OVERCOMING INEVITABLE LEGAL AND POLITICAL OBSTACLES ON THE WAY OF MODERNIZATION OF THE SUPREME LAW OF STATE. FOR ILLUSTRATION AUTHOR HAS SELECTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT MOMENTS IN MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS OF CANADA. IT BELONGS TO THE LEGAL FAMILY OF COMMON LAW COUNTRIES AND IN OUR TIMES IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND THE MOST RESPECTED ACROSS THE WORLD CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERAL STATES. THE ARTICLE CONTAINS DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND EXPLORATION OF THE PRINCIPAL AND SECOND-RATE FEATURES OF CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION MECHANISM FUNCTIONING IN THIS NORTH AMERICAN STATE. IN THE FIELD OF ANALYZING MODEL OF FEDERAL STATE CREATED BY CANADIANS AUTHOR DIRECTED HIS MAIN ATTENTION TO THE DIVISION OF COMPETENCE AND ITS SUBJECTS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL LEVELS OF PUBLIC POWER AND TO KEY TURNS IN DYNAMICS OF THEIRS MUTUAL RELATIONS CHANGING IN CONTEMPORARY CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE IS EXPLORATION OF THE ROLE AND PLACE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS AND JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS IN CANADIAN LEGAL DOCTRINE AND CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE. THERE IS EMPHASIZED IN ARTICLE THE MULTIPLICITY OF WAYS AND MEANS IMPLEMENTING IN PROCESS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN OTTAWA AND MEMBERS OF CANADIAN FEDERATION. AUTHOR TRIES TO CLEAR A MEASURE OF NECESSITY AND EXPEDIENCY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF 1980S AND TO IDENTIFY CHIEF PHASES OF THE LATTER. HE STUDIES AN IMPACT MADE BY JUDICIAL INSTANCES AT THE LEVEL OF PROVINCES AND FEDERAL CENTER INTO MODERNIZING CANADIAN CONSTITUTION, INCLUDING THE SENTENCES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN PATRIATION CASE. THERE IS CHECKED IN THE PAPER BIG MEASURE OF SOCIAL PURPOSE PRODUCING BY POWER BODIES BY ACTING INCLUSIVELY IN THE LIMITS OF THE RULE OF LAW (INCLUDING PARLIAMENTARY STATUTES, USAGES, ETC.), BY SUBORDINATION OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES TO LAW AND ORDER IMPERATIVES AND BY SUBORDINATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BODIES TO JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND OPINIONS, IN PARTICULAR. AUTHOR PRESENTS HIS LOOK AT CONDITIONS OF CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AFTER REFORM, ESPECIALLY VIS-A-VIS GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC STEADY OPPOSITION TO CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CANADIANS. ALSO HE POSITIVELY EVALUATES QUALITIES AND LEVEL OF STATE LEADERSHIP OF FEDERAL POWERS IN MODERNIZING CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY STATE.
245	PURPOSE - THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN ENSURING LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND ITS IMPACT ON GOVERNANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF BANGLADESH. ALTHOUGH, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF BANGLADESH COMPRISES SUPREME COURT, SUBORDINATE COURTS AND TRIBUNALS. HOWEVER, THIS STUDY FOCUSES SUPREME COURT ONLY TO KEEP THE STUDY IN A MANAGEABLE EXTENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY IS QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND BASED ON CONTENT ANALYSIS. DHAKA LAW REPORT (DLR), WHICH IS A MONTHLY PUBLISHED REPORT ON CASE LAWS[1] DECIDED BY THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN SELECTED AS CONTENT FOR THIS STUDY. SOME CASE LAWS SELECTED FROM DLR (2004-2008) WERE ANALYZED USING PURPOSIVE SAMPLING METHOD, WITH A VIEW TO EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIARY (AS AN EXTERNAL BUT FORMAL MECHANISM OF ACCOUNTABILITY) IN ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON OVERALL GOVERNANCE. FINDINGS - THE MOST IMPORTANT FINDING OF THIS PAPER IS THAT THE JUDICIARY IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ENSURING LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WHICH ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTES TO HUMAN RIGHTS AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. HOWEVER, A MAJOR PROBLEM FOUND WAS THAT UNTIL AND UNLESS AN AFFECTED PERSON FILES A CASE AGAINST A GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY, MAINTAINING THE REQUIRED PROCEDURES OF JUDICIARY, IT (THE JUDICIARY) HAS NO SCOPE TO SETTLE ANY DISPUTES. THOUGH THERE IS A PROVISION OF SUO MUTO (BY OWN INITIATIVE) RULE OF THE SUPREME COURT, THIS PRACTICE IS VERY RARE IN BANGLADESH. FURTHERMORE, THE EXECUTIVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE VERDICT OF THE JUDICIARY. THEREFORE, IF THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ENOUGH RESPECT FOR, OR DOES NOT CARE TO IMPLEMENT JUDICIARY'S VERDICT, JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW WILL NOT BE ENSURED. THIS STUDY ALSO FOUND SOME CASES LIKE THIS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THIS WORK DOES NOT ADDRESS DETAILED ISSUES OF GOVERNANCE AND IS NOT BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THIS IS A MIXED STUDY OF JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS VERY RARE IN BANGLADESH. THEREFORE, IT WILL BE BROUGHT INTO LINE WITH CURRENT PRACTICE BY THE CONCERNED RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND JUDICIARY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER WILL BE OF INTEREST TO LEGAL PRACTITIONERS, POLICY MAKERS, ACADEMICIANS AND THOSE IN THE FIELD OF GOVERNANCE.
246	CHOICE OF LAW IS A MESS-OR SO IT IS SAID. ACCORDING TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, CHOICE-OF-LAW DOCTRINE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE JUDGES' CHOICE-OF-LAW DECISIONS. INSTEAD, THESE DECISIONS ARE PRIMARILY MOTIVATED BY BIASES IN FAVOR OF DOMESTIC OVER FOREIGN LAW, DOMESTIC OVER FOREIGN LITIGANTS, AND PLAINTIFFS OVER DEFENDANTS. THEY ARE ALSO HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE "MESS" CLAIMS DO NOT ACCURATELY DESCRIBE AT LEAST ONE DOMAIN OF CHOICE OF LAW-INTERNATIONAL CHOICE OF LAW-AND IT DEMONSTRATES WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS DEBATE FOR GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. PART I PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CHOICE-OF-LAW DOCTRINE IN THE UNITED STATES. PART II DOCUMENTS THE MESS CLAIMS. PART III THEN SHOWS HOW THE MESS CLAIMS, IF CORRECT, WOULD BE BAD NEWS FOR GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. CHOICE-OF-LAW DOCTRINE CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE GLOBAL ECONOMIC WELFARE, ENHANCE OR UNDERMINE TRANSNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, AND FACILITATE OR HINDER TRANSNATIONAL BARGAINING. THE EXTENT OF THESE EFFECTS, AND WHETHER THEY ARE BENEFICIAL OR HARMFUL, DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH CHOICE-OF-LAW DOCTRINE ACTUALLY INFLUENCES JUDGES' INTERNATIONAL CHOICE-OF-LAW DECISIONS AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE DECISIONS ARE BIASED AND UNPREDICTABLE. THE MESS CLAIMS THUS IMPLY THAT IF CHOICE OF LAW HAS ANY SYSTEMATIC EFFECTS ON GLOBAL GOVERNANCE THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE HARMFUL. PART IV USES STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF AN ORIGINAL DATASET OF PUBLISHED INTERNATIONAL CHOICE-OF-LAW DECISIONS BY U.S. DISTRICT COURTS IN TORT CASES TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT CHOICE-OF-LAW DOCTRINE INDEED INFLUENCES THESE DECISIONS; THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE NOT BIASED IN FAVOR OF DOMESTIC LAW, DOMESTIC LITIGANTS, OR PLAINTIFFS; AND THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY QUITE PREDICTABLE. THE MESS CLAIMS, IT TURNS OUT, MAY BE MYTHS-AT LEAST IN TRANSNATIONAL TORT CASES. PART V EXPLORES THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF MY ANALYSIS. IN PARTICULAR, IT EXPLAINS WHY THESE FINDINGS ARE ENCOURAGING FROM A GLOBAL-GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE AND WHY THEY MIGHT PLAUSIBLY EXTEND TO UNPUBLISHED INTERNATIONAL CHOICE-OF-LAW DECISIONS AND DOMESTIC CHOICE-OF-LAW DECISIONS. OVERALL, THE ARTICLE'S FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM EXAGGERATES WHAT IS WRONG WITH CHOICE OF LAW AND IMPLICITLY UNDERESTIMATES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.
247	IN THE COLLAPSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDIES, AZIZ HUQ CHALLENGES THE IDEALISTIC VIEW OF FEDERAL COURTS AS FAITHFUL EXPONENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION'S PROTECTIONS FOR LIBERTY. HE INSISTS THAT THE FRAMERS' DESIGN OF ARTICLE III IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED, RESULTING IN A JUDICIARY THAT IS ILL-DISPOSED TO FURNISHING INDIVIDUAL REMEDIES FOR UNCONSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE YET OVERLY SOLICITOUS OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION-ESPECIALLY CHALLENGES FOUNDED UPON THE CONSTITUTION'S STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM OR SEPARATION OF POWERS. ACCORDING TO HUQ, THIS JUDICIAL DOUBLE STANDARD EXACERBATES SOCIETAL INEQUITIES TO THE DETRIMENT OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS. HE CONTENDS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT LIMIT GOVERNMENT'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAVE LARGELY MALIGN EFFECTS, WHEREAS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AGAINST CORPOREAL COERCION PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AT LITTLE COST TO SOCIETY AT LARGE. TO ADDRESS THE PERCEIVED FAILINGS OF THE JUDICIARY - AND TO ACHIEVE WHAT HUQ CALLS "REDISTRIBUTIVE GOALS" - HE PROPOSES VARIOUS REFORMS, INCLUDING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD STRIP FEDERAL COURTS OF JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT HUQ CONSIDERS HARMFUL. IN THIS BOOK REVIEW, WE SET FORTH OUR OWN ACCOUNT OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE, AND JUDICIAL REMEDIATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL WRONGS-AN ACCOUNT THAT DIFFERS FROM HUQ'S IN MANY RESPECTS. HUQ IS UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT THAT FEDERAL COURTS HAVE SOMETIMES COME UP SHORT IN DISPENSING REMEDIES FOR OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT. HE IS ALSO JUSTIFIED IN HIS CRITICISMS OF CERTAIN DOCTRINES, PARTICULARLY QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF THOSE SEEKING LEGAL REDRESS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL WRONGS. BUT HUQ'S CLAIMS OF REMEDIAL "COLLAPSE" ARE LARGELY OVERSTATED, AND HIS ALLEGATIONS OF JUDICIAL PARTIALITY FOR CERTAIN LITIGANTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS DO NOT WITHSTAND SCRUTINY. WE FURTHER ARGUE THAT HUQ'S NORMATIVE CASE FOR EXALTING SOME CONSTITUTIONAL RULES WHILE DISREGARDING OTHERS IS UNSOUND AND MISGUIDED. IN SO ARGUING, WE HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT HUQ DISPARAGES-SUCH AS STRUCTURAL PROVISIONS AND SO-CALLED "RIGHTS AGAINST REGULATION" - AS WELL AS THE COSTS OF THOSE HE CELEBRATES. FINALLY, GIVEN OUR CONCERN THAT MEASURES SUCH AS HUQ'S PROPOSED JURISDICTION-STRIPPING LEGISLATION ARE INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW, WE CONCLUDE WITH ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD ADVANCE HIS PROFESSED AIMS WITHOUT IMPERILING OUR SYSTEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE.
248	THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS TO GENERALLY APPLICABLE LAW (OR OVERLY GENEROUS 'MOST FAVORED NATION' INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION-WHICH AMOUNT IN PRACTICE TO EXEMPTIONS), ALSO KNOWN AS "ACCOMMODATIONS," SHOULD NOT BE EXTENDED TO MEMBERS OF FAITH GROUPS WITH SUFFICIENT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, OR SOCIAL POWER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS ("MAJORITY RELIGIONS"). THE ARGUMENT BEGINS WITH THE BEST DEFENSE OF ACCOMMODATIONS. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE NORMATIVE PRINCIPLE KNOWN AS "THE RULE OF LAW," RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS PROTECT ADHERENTS OF MINORITY FAITHS FROM HAVING THEIR INTERESTS DISREGARDED BY DOMINANT SOCIAL AND POLITICAL GROUPS. IN THE ABSENCE OF ACCOMMODATIONS, RELIGIOUS MINORITIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO LAW THAT DOES NOT GENUINELY TREAT THEM AS FREE AND EQUAL MEMBERS OF A PLURALISTIC COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, SUCH CONSIDERATIONS CANNOT JUSTIFY ACCOMMODATIONS FOR POWERFUL FAITH GROUPS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND WHOSE MEMBERS ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE THEIR INTERESTS DISREGARDED BY LEGISLATORS. MOREOVER, MEMBERS OF GROUPS WITH SUBSTANTIAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC POWER CAN USE EXEMPTIONS NOT TO PROTECT THEIR OWN FREEDOM AND EQUAL STANDING, BUT TO UNDERMINE THE FREEDOM AND EQUAL STANDING OF OTHERS, A DYNAMIC PROMINENTLY ILLUSTRATED BY LITIGATION OVER CONTRACEPTION COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE COURTS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE WILLING TO BEAR THE EPISTEMIC BURDEN OF SORTING EXEMPTIONS CLAIMS BY THE POWER OF THOSE MAKING THEM. IN VIEW OF THE LIKELY IMPENDING FALL OF THE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH DOCTRINE, UNDER WHICH EXEMPTIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED UNDER THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE, THE ARGUMENT OF THIS ESSAY SUGGESTS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT FREE EXERCISE JURISPRUDENCE MAY ACTUALLY UNDERMINE RATHER THAN PROTECT THE FREEDOM OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT ADHERENTS OF POWERFUL RELIGIONS-PARTICULARLY SECULARISTS AND ADHERENTS OF VERY SMALL AND UNCONVENTIONAL RELIGIONS SUCH AS WICCA, THE SATANIC TEMPLE, AND OTHERS-TO PURSUE THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF THE GOOD AND THE FULFILLMENT OF THEIR MORAL VALUES IN THEIR OWN LIVES. THE MOST LIKELY FUTURE FOR FREE EXERCISE DOCTRINE THREATENS TO MAKE THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT MEMBERS OF SIZABLE MAINSTREAM ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS LESS FREE AND LESS EQUAL.
249	WHAT DRIVES ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTION IN PARTICULAR WAYS? THIS ARTICLE RECOVERS A FORGOTTEN CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE THAT SHEDS LIGHT ON THAT QUESTION. LONG AFTER BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, FEDERAL EDUCATION OFFICIALS CONTINUED TO FUND SEGREGATED SCHOOLS, ARGUING THAT THEIR AGENCY BORE NO IMMEDIATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE. IN THE PRESENT, THAT POSITION SEEMS DEEPLY SURPRISING-EVEN AT ODDS WITH THE RULE OF LAW. BUT THE ADMINISTRATORS DID WHAT THEIR AGENCY HAD BEEN DESIGNED TO DO: EXTEND THE FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION WITHOUT THEREBY EXTENDING FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. CONGRESS ENGINEERED THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF EDUCATION, PREDECESSOR TO TODAY'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR SCHOOLS WHILE AVOIDING FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION'S EQUALITY PRINCIPLES. LEGISLATORS AND THEIR ALLIES FOUND SUPPORT FOR THAT APPROACH IN A DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL GOAL: DEFERENCE TO STATES' AUTHORITY WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. THE RESULTING INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF FEDERAL SUPPORT WITHOUT FEDERAL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT ENDURED UNTIL THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 TRANSFORMED IT. CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS' BATTLE TO ENFORCE BROWN'S PRINCIPLE AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ILLUSTRATES A BASIC FEATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM: AGENCIES CAN BE DESIGNED TO SERVE, OR DISSERVE, A BROAD RANGE OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOALS. ANY PARTICULAR AGENCY'S APPROACH TO THE CONSTITUTION WILL REFLECT THE ENDURING INFLUENCE (AND VARIABILITY) OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE AND STRUCTURE. THOSE ASPECTS OF INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN ARE SHAPED BY CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT, OFTEN IN LIGHT OF UNDERLYING DIVISIONS OVER THE CONSTITUTION'S MANDATES REGARDING FEDERAL POWER, ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY, AND SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS. AS A RESULT, AN AGENCY'S CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATIONS MAY REFLECT THE OUTCOMES OF PRIOR POLITICAL STRUGGLES OVER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, WHICH BECOME EMBEDDED IN AND TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE AGENCY'S SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONAL TRAITS. UNDERSTANDING WHY AGENCIES ENFORCE THE CONSTITUTION IN SPECIFIC WAYS THUS REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING HOW POLITICAL ACTORS IN CONGRESS, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND BEYOND HAVE STRUCTURED THOSE AGENCIES OVER TIME. THAT TRUTH, ENCAPSULATED IN THE STRUGGLE OVER FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR SEGREGATION, ALSO ILLUMINATES A KEY REASON THAT RACIAL SEGREGATION AND INEQUALITY HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO UPROOT: MUCH OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE STATE WAS INITIALLY DESIGNED TO COEXIST WITH DISCRIMINATION, NOT COMBAT IT.
250	AFRICA IS EXPERIENCING AN UNUSUALLY HIGH ECONOMIC INTEREST FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WHOSE GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SCHOOLS, CLINICS, ROADS, RAILWAYS, FACTORIES, AND OIL WELLS ON THE CONTINENT; HAS CANCELED MORE THAN $1.36 BILLION IN DEBTS OWED TO IT BY 33 AFRICAN NATIONS; AND HAS PLEDGED TO PROVIDE AFRICA WITH $5 BILLION IN PREFERENTIAL LOANS AND CREDITS THROUGH 2009. ITS TOP PARTY OFFICIALS TRAVERSE THE CONTINENT, SEEKING TO DEVELOP BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS AND TO REINFORCE OTHERS. WHILE SUCH EFFORTS HELP PLACE AFRICA ON THE CUSP OF SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC GROWTH, THEY ALSO BOOST THE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE NAIROBI, KENYA-BASED FEDERATION OF AFRICAN PUBLIC RELATIONS ASSOCIATIONS (FAPRA), AN UMBRELLA BODY OF ALL NATIONAL PUBLIC RELATIONS ASSOCIATIONS IN AFRICA AND A CONSULTANT TO AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS AND TO THE AFRICAN UNION. FAPRA HAS LAUNCHED A 5-YEAR ACTION PLAN TO IMPROVE THE STATURE AND SOCIAL RELEVANCE OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS PRACTICE, LARGELY THROUGH ENHANCING ITS EFFORTS TO PROFESSIONALIZE IT. BOTH CHINA AND FAPRA ARE, IN ESSENCE, COLLABORATING TO CREATE ENVIRONMENTS CONDUCIVE TO ENHANCING THE PRACTICE IN AFRICA, AND TO LAYING A FOUNDATION FOR AN EXPANSIVE VIEW OF PUBLIC RELATIONS RESEARCH-ONE THAT QUESTIONS GRAND NARRATIVES, DEFINES CONCEPTS, CHALLENGES ORTHODOXIES, MEASURES VARIABLES, AND DETERMINES PROGRAM OUTCOMES OR EFFECTS. AND RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS WORK TOGETHER IN CREATIVE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT QUESTIONS AND CONCEPTS ARE, IN THEMSELVES, OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MUCH-NEEDED THEORY BUILDING IN AFRICA'S PUBLIC RELATIONS. IT, THEREFORE, OUTLINES 4 PROPOSITIONS AS A TEMPLATE FOR SUCH THEORY BUILDING, BASED ON A 4-CONCEPT RESEARCH AGENDA: CULTURE, GOOD GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC FREEDOM, AND FAPRA'S INTEGRATED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN ITS 5-YEAR ACTION PLAN. THE RETURN OF CHINA ... TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROMINENCE IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IS LIKELY TO RESHAPE GLOBAL POLITICS AND SOCIETY. THE OVERWHELMING DOMINANCE OF THE WEST, WHICH LASTED HALF A MILLENNIUM, IS PROBABLY PASSE. WE SHOULD VIEW THESE DEVELOPMENTS NOT ONLY WITH AWE, BUT WITH ANTICIPATION. (SACHS, 2005, P. 187) WE WANT TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT MUST BE A PARTNERSHIP BASED ON MUTUAL RESPECT AND MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY. (FORMER NAMIBIAN PRIME MINISTER GEINGOB, 2006, P. 56)
251	INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF AREAS IN THE SPACE FIELD. OVER THE PAST YEARS, MANY BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED, PROVIDING SOLID LEGAL BASIS FOR SPACE COOPERATION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THESE AGREEMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE COOPERATION AND PUT FORWARD SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO FURTHER FACILITATE THE CONCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS SO THAT INTERNATIONAL SPACE COOPERATION CAN BE CARRIED OUT MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS TO REALIZE INTERNATIONAL SPACE COOPERATION AND THAT WE WILL NEED TO FURTHER STUDY POSSIBLE MEANS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL SPACE COOPERATION IN WIDER SCOPE THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS.

252	THE ARTICLE SCRUTINIZES THE PURPORTED SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI) AND THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT BY EVALUATING THE TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER REGULATING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF BRI ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THREE PROBLEMATIC FEATURES ARE IDENTIFIED. FIRST, THE BILATERAL CHARACTER OF AGREEMENTS BETWEEN CHINA AND BRI-PARTICIPATING STATES PRODUCES FRAGMENTED AND VARIABLE SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS. SECOND, THE INFORMALITY OF STATE-TO-STATE ARRANGEMENTS OFTEN HINDER PARLIAMENTARY AND PUBLIC DELIBERATION IN HOST STATES. LASTLY, BRI DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES RESTRICT NON-STATE ACTOR PARTICIPATION AND THEREBY DISREGARD THE VERY COMMUNITIES HARMED BY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. TO CLEAR ITS PATH TO SUSTAINABILITY AND BRING IT CLOSER TO THE UN AGENDA, BRI'S LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK MUST BECOME MULTILATERAL, TRANSPARENT, AND INCLUSIVE. THE PROPOSAL ENTAILS BRINGING TO FORE THE RELEVANT BACKGROUND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL NORMS, ESPECIALLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL, LABOR, AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, AND CONSOLIDATING THEM IN A FRAMEWORK AGREEMENT THAT SETS MINIMUM SUSTAINABILITY SAFEGUARDS FOR TRANSBOUNDARY ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES LIKE FOREIGN-FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. REFORMS ARE IMPERATIVE BECAUSE THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INITIATIVE REQUIRES INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL CONCERNS OF TWO STATES BUT ALSO IMPLICATES THE GOALS AND INTERESTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.
253	AS RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICE IS REGARDED AS A RADICAL DEPARTURE FROM MARXIST ATHEISM, THE ABNORMAL EXISTENCE OF GHOST MARRIAGES UNDER THE CHINESE SOCIALIST REGIME HAS ATTRACTED WIDE SCHOLARLY ATTENTION IN ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY. HOWEVER, FEW SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED ON HOW CHINESE COURTS TREAT RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICES, SUCH AS GHOST MARRIAGES, DESPITE THE OFFICIAL SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY. BASED ON THE TYPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND CASE STUDY INVOLVING 260 GHOST MARRIAGE CASES, THE AUTHORS ARGUE ABOUT THE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM OF CHINESE COURTS TOWARDS ATHEIST IDEOLOGY IN RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ARE TWOFOLD. FIRST, THE CHINESE COURTS' ATTITUDES TOWARD GHOST MARRIAGE CASES ARE PLURALISTIC, REFLECTING THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM'S SELECTIVE OBEDIENCE TO THE SOCIALIST IDEOLOGY. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS OF RELEVANT LAWS, CHINESE COURTS HAVE SHOWN THREE ATTITUDES TOWARDS GHOST MARRIAGES: ENCOURAGEMENT, TOLERANCE, AND SUPPRESSION. THE FIRST TWO ATTITUDES CAN BE REGARDED AS SUPPORTIVE SUPERVISION OF RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICE. THREE FACTORS TENDED TO AFFECT THE COURTS' ATTITUDES TOWARDS GHOST MARRIAGES: COURTS' HIERARCHICAL LEVEL, PARTIES' CLAIMS, AND WHETHER GHOST MARRIAGE RITUALS ARE PERFORMED. SECOND, FURTHER ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT RPC'S GUERRILLA-STYLE GOVERNANCE STRATEGY IN THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM ALLOWS IT TO DEAL WITH GHOST MARRIAGE WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY, EVEN OVERRIDING ITS FUNDAMENTALIST IDEOLOGY. THE GUERRILLA-STYLE TACTIC IS OFTEN USED BY THE CHINESE COURTS TO HANDLE MATTERS OF RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICES IN A PLURALISTIC MANNER. OVERALL, THE COURTS' PLURALISTIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS GHOST MARRIAGE IS THAT OF MODEST TOLERANCE AND COOPERATION OF RELIGIOUS FOLK PRACTICES BASED ON THE RPC'S MODEL OF GOVERNANCE.
254	THE JORDAN RIFT VALLEY IS A HIGH-RISK LOW-OCCURRENCE ZONE FOR EARTHQUAKES, WITH DOCUMENTED INCIDENCES WITHIN THE LAST MILLENNIUM CAUSING WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE IMMEDIATE RISKS FOR EARTHQUAKE READINESS. DUE TO DATA AVAILABILITY, WE FOCUS ON ISRAEL'S READINESS FOR EARTHQUAKES AND COMPARE OUR FINDINGS WITH A CURSORY REVIEW OF READINESS IN THE PROXIMATE COUNTRIES. READINESS REFERS TO MITIGATION AND PREPAREDNESS (BEFORE), RESPONSE (DURING) AND RECOVERY (AFTER). THE IMMEDIATE AND PALPABLE THREATS IN THE REGION ARE WARS AND TERRORISM, AND OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT GOVERNANCE CULTURE IN THIS VOLATILE REGION IS GEARED TOWARD CAPACITIES AND EXPERTISE WHICH HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS, CHARACTERIZED BY EMPHASIS ON QUICK RESPONSE. WE EXPECT TO SEE A BIAS TOWARD IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WITH REGARD TO EARTHQUAKE READINESS AS WELL, WITH ATTENTION ALSO PAID TO PREPAREDNESS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT OTHER ASPECTS OF READINESS, SUCH AS RETROFITTING OF BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MITIGATION CATEGORY, LAG BEHIND IN COUNTRIES SURROUNDING THE JORDAN RIFT. TO TEST THIS, WE DEVELOP AND APPLY A REGULATORY SYSTEM SCAN AND ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY TO THE ISRAELI CASE. THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDES STRUCTURED MAPPING AND EVALUATION OF THE RELEVANT REGULATORY SYSTEM AS WELL AS ACTUAL POLICY OUTPUTS. THE PROCESS INCLUDES INPUTS FROM POLICY MAKERS, EXPERTS, AND STAKEHOLDERS. FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE COUNTRY'S EARTHQUAKE READINESS REGIME IS INDEED HEAVILY BIASED TOWARD IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WHICH IS CONTINUALLY ADVANCING AND IMPROVING, MANAGED BY SECURITY-RELATED BODIES. IN CONTRAST, MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE DEFICIENT AND LITTLE IS BEING DONE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. A SURVEY OF READINESS EFFORTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES ALONG THE JORDAN RIFT POINTS TO A SIMILAR SITUATION.
255	THE LATEST RUSSIAN REGULATORY REFORM (2016) SOUGHT TO INTRODUCE THE RISK-ORIENTATED APPROACH- A MOVE AWAY FROM THE "BLANKET INSPECTIONS" (OR THE RISK REGULATION REFLEX - A TERM COINED BY BLANC IN 2011) METHOD THAT HAS BEEN CRITICISED BY THE RUSSIAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO ASSESS ITS SUCCESS USING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON FEDERAL WATCHDOGS' INSPECTIONS. WE ARGUE THAT THIS REFORM ULTIMATELY FAILED IN ITS GOAL REGARDING THE OVERALL NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS, AND THUS THE VOLUME OF REGULATORY BURDEN DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE REFORM. THIS FAILURE RESULTED FROM TWO MECHANISMS. FIRST, THE LEGAL FRAMING OF THE REFORM RADICALLY REDEFINED RISK AS THE PROBABILITY OF INCOMPLIANCE (AS OPPOSED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACCIDENT). SECOND, THE WATCHDOGS USED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT INCENTIVISED "STREET-LEVEL" INSPECTORS TO MAINTAIN THE PRE-REFORM REGULATORY BURDEN LEVELS.
256	THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE NORMS OF CIVIL LAW REGULATING THE ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT IN REM AND ITS PROTECTION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THE IDEA OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION OF REAL ACTIONS TO PROTECT THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION OF A PERSON ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIGHT AND LEGITIMATE INTEREST. COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD, THE METHOD OF CASE STUDY AND THE METHOD OF SYSTEMATIZATION BECAME THE METHODS OF RESEARCH. IN THE SYSTEM OF REAL ACTIONS LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS ARE PROTECTED BY THE ACTION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE PROPERTY RIGHT. IT IS APPLICABLE WHEN A PERSON HAS COMMITTED ALL NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT ACTIONS TO ACQUIRE THE RIGHT, BUT BY VIRTUE OF THE PRESCRIPTION OF THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES A JUDICIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RIGHT IN REM. THEREFORE, IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH SUCH A TYPE OF LEGAL EXPECTATION AS A PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION. PECULIARITIES OF PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION, WHICH DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION, CONSIST IN SEVERAL ASPECTS. FIRSTLY, PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS AIMED AT THE ACQUISITION OF A RIGHT IN REM. SECONDLY, PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS AIMED AT SUCH ACQUISITION, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT ONLY THROUGH A JUDICIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE ENTIRE NECESSARY TOTALITY OF LEGAL FACTS. THIRDLY, THE PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION INTRODUCES LEGAL CERTAINTY, THROUGH THE DECISION ON THE COMPLETENESS OF THE PROCESS OF ACQUISITION OF THE RIGHT IN REM. THE CONSTRUCT OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS DEVELOPED AT THE LEVEL OF JUDICIAL DOCTRINE, BECAUSE IT IS APPLIED BY THE COURTS IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS NO SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION. THIS DOCTRINE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW - LEGAL CERTAINTY AND GOOD FAITH. THE CORRELATION OF LEGITIMATE INTEREST AND LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS MANIFESTED IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE AIMED AT CREATING A NEW RIGHT. THE LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS A MORE CONCRETE LEGAL PHENOMENON THAN THE LEGITIMATE INTEREST, WHICH IS MORE ABSTRACT. AS PART OF THE APPLICATION OF REAL ACTIONS, LEGITIMATE INTEREST SERVES AS A LEGAL BASIS FOR AN ACTION FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE PROPERTY RIGHT. HAVING CONDUCTED A COMPARATIVE LEGAL STUDY, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE PROPERTY LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION IS KNOWN IN THE LAW OF THE COUNTRIES OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND IN COMMON LAW COUNTRIES; EXAMPLES ARE, IN PARTICULAR, THE GERMAN "ANWARTSCHAFTSRECHT", COMMON LAW CATEGORIES OF "FUTURE INTEREST", "DOCTRINE OF ACCELERATION" AND "REMAINDER".
257	ENVIRONMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS ARE A MEANS OF PRECAUTIONS AIMING FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, REDUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES, NONREPEATION OF ACTS CAUSING THE DAMAGE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE MENTIONED ACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION SHALL BE CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW, LEGALITY, LEGAL CERTAINTY. IT IS IMPORTANT TO A GREAT EXTENT TO DEMONSTRATE THE LEGALITY OF THE SANCTIONS AND MEASURES WHEN APPLIED SUBSEQUENTLY FOR JUDICIAL REMEDY, DURING WHICH IN THE PROCESS OF APPLICATION OF SUCH SANCTIONS, DOCUMENTATION OF THE CONTAMINATIVE ACTIVITIES AND REVEAL OF ACTIVITIES TRANSPARENTLY WITH ITS JUSTIFICATION HAD BEEN REALIZED. IN THE ENVIRONMENT LAW NUMBERED 2872, THE PROCEDURES AND PRINCIPLES ARE DETERMINED, WHICH MUST BE OBEYED BY THE OFFICER IN CHARGE ASSIGNED BY THE CENTRAL OR PROVINCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE MINISTRY OR BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY OF STATE INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS AUTHORIZED BY THE MINISTRY FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISION FOR DETECTION OF VIOLATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE THE IMPOSE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER SOME FACTORS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROCESS TO BE APPLIED AGAINST ANY ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE DUTIES AND POWERS IN THE FIELD OF PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, SUCH AS THE INVESTIGATIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT IN ORDER TO CLEARLY REVEAL THE SOURCE OF THE POLLUTING ACTIVITY, THE MEANS THAT CAN BE USED IN DETERMINING THE VIOLATION, THE CONDITIONS TO REGARD REAL OR LEGAL PERSONS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR POLLUTING ACTIVITY, WHICH ABOLISHES THE HESITATIONS RELEVANT TO THE SOURCE OF POLLUTION. WHEN THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE ARE EXAMINED, IN SOME OF THE DECISIONS IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE VIOLATION ARE MENTIONED AND SOME OF THE SANCTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURE STATED IN THE LEGISLATION ARE CANCELLED. IN THIS STUDY, A DISCUSSION WILL BE MADE ON THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNCIL OF STATE AND THE REASONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND AN EMPHASIS WILL BE GIVEN TO THE PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTATION AND LEGISLATION. RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE PUT FORWARD FOR THE PROCEDURES AND PRINCIPLES TO BE MORE SPECIFIC IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND TO STRENGTHEN THE LAWFULNESS OF THE SANCTIONS, WHICH ARE FOLLOWED IN THE AREAS WHERE INSPECTION MAY BE CARRIED OUT BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTION TEAMS AND WHERE SEA, LAND, AIR AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES MAY ARISE.
258	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE DISCUSSION IN RESEARCH LITERATURE ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF A SERIAL CRIMINAL. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH OF SERIAL CRIMINALS HAS SHOWN THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS QUALITATIVELY CHARACTERISTIC FOR ALL CULTURES. AN INSIGHT INTO THE HISTORY OF THE PHENOMENON OF SERIAL KILLERS WAS MADE. THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF THE STUDIED OBJECTS IS DISCLOSED. THE RESULT OF THE STUDY WAS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEED FOR A NEW VIEW ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE UNIQUE COMPLEX OF PSYCHOTYPOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT FORM A UNIQUE GROUP OF DEVIANTS - SERIAL CRIMINALS. SEPARATELY, THE AUTHORS CONSIDERED THE REASON WHY THE DOMESTIC SCIENCE THAT INVESTIGATES CRIME IS NOT INCLINED TO USE THE CONCEPT "SERIAL CRIMINAL". THE PROBLEM OF INADMISSIBLE OVERLAPPING OF THE TERMS "MULTIPLICITY" AND "SERIALITY" AS APPLIED TO THE NATURE OF SERIAL CRIMES IS ALSO CONSIDERED. INDEED, IT IS BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE OBJECT UNDER STUDY THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF THE TERMS. THE ARTICLE NOTES THAT DESPITE THE WIDE USE OF THE TERM "SERIAL KILLER" IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE AND IN THEORETICAL WORKS ON CRIMINALISTICS, CRIMINOLOGY, LEGAL PSYCHOLOGY AND FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY, THE CRIMINAL LAW LEGISLATION AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION DOES NOT CONTAIN SUCH A TERM. HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF THE DEFINITION IN THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT THE REASON FOR AN EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE TERM, SINCE THE LOGIC OF A RESEARCH LIMITS TO SOME EXTENT THE EXTENSIVE USE OF CONCEPTS IN RESEARCH. THE METHOD OF BIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED TOGETHER WITH PRIVATE SCIENTIFIC METHODS, AS WELL AS THE METHOD OF EXPERT REVIEW. IN SPECIAL LITERATURE, THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT "SERIAL CRIMINAL" INCLUDES A LARGE NUMBER OF ATTRIBUTES; THE TRADITIONAL ARE: (1) A CERTAIN NUMBER OF EPISODES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY (TWO OR MORE); (2) THE DEPICTION OF A PARTICULAR PSYCHO-TRAUMATIC IMAGE IN THE VICTIM'S IMAGE; (3) THE PERIOD OF EMOTIONAL REST (UP TO 30 DAYS) BETWEEN CRIMES OF THE SERIES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ONLY A FEW VARIETIES OF SERIAL CRIMINALS FULLY COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS. THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, DISORGANIZED SERIAL KILLERS, WHO MAKE UP AT LEAST A THIRD OF SERIAL KILLERS, DO NOT HAVE SUCH A PARAMETER IN THEIR PERSONALITY STRUCTURE AS "THE DEPICTION OF A PARTICULAR PSYCHO-TRAUMATIC IMAGE IN THE VICTIM'S IMAGE". THE AUTHORS STATE ONE CAN OBSERVE THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF RESEARCH OF SERIAL CRIMINALS ALREADY AT THE LEVEL OF THE MAIN CONCEPTUAL SPACE, WHICH SHOULD BE CORRECTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
259	SINCE THE 2020 ELECTIONS, DEBATE ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MECHANISMS OF NATIONAL DEMOCRACY HAS INTENSIFIED. ONE IMPORTANT THREAD OF THAT DEBATE FOCUSES CRITICALLY ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A JUDICIAL DECISION FLIPPING A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OR THWARTING THE WILL OF NATIONAL MAJORITIES RESPECTING PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION, AND PUSHES CONCERNS ABOUT THE COURT'S EFFECT ON NATIONAL DEMOCRACY. A NARROW FOCUS ON SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS, HOWEVER, DOES NOT EXHAUST THE SUBTLE AND CONSEQUENTIAL WAYS IN WHICH THE COURT INFLUENCES WHETHER AND HOW THE AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM THRIVES OR FAILS. A NARROW FOCUS IS PARTIAL BECAUSE IT CONSTRUES DEMOCRACY AS MERELY THE AGGREGATION OF SPECIFIC ACTS OR MOMENTS, NOT A COMPLEX SYSTEM MADE UP OF ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND PARTIES DISPOSED TO ACCEPT ELECTORAL LOSS.THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A NEW ANALYSIS OF THE RELATION BETWEEN JUDICIAL POWER AND THE QUALITY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THIS ACCOUNT IS NESTED IN A WIDER, SYSTEMIC PERSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FORCES. DRAWING ON RECENT EMPIRICAL WORK IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS, THIS ARTICLE SITUATES THE ROBERTS COURT AT THE NEXUS OF THREE INTERSECTING "LONG CRISES" OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THE FIRST IS THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT EMBEDDED IN THE CONSTITUTION'S ORIGINAL 1787 DESIGN. THE SECOND IS A SHARP INCREASE IN WEALTH INEQUALITY SINCE THE 1970S. THE THIRD IS THE MORE RECENT REEMERGENCE OF A SOMETIMES VIOLENT "WHITE IDENTITY POLITICS" AS A RIFT STARKLY BISECTING THE ELECTORATE. THE FRAGILITY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ARISES FROM AN UNTIMELY CONFLUENCE OF THESE THREE FORCES, WHICH UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN UNFOLDING ALONG SEPARATE TRACKS AT DIFFERENT TEMPOS.THE ROBERTS COURT ARBITRAGES BETWEEN THESE THREE COUNTERDEMOCRATIC DYNAMICS IN WAYS THAT IMPOSE CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE ON THE INCLUSIVE NORMS AND REPRESENTATIVE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH DEMOCRACY WORKS. FOUR LINES OF PRECEDENT MERIT ATTENTION IN UNDERSTANDING THE CONVERGENCE OF THE "LONG" CRISES OF DEMOCRACY. THESE (1) GUARANTEE ECONOMIC CAPITAL, BUT NOT ASSOCIATIONS, A POLITICAL RETURN; (2) GERRYMANDER CIVIL SOCIETY BY REWARDING HIERARCHICAL, BUT NOT EGALITARIAN, MOBILIZATION; (3) FACILITATE A PERNICIOUS FORM OF WHITE IDENTITY POLITICS; AND (4) UNDERMINE ELECTORAL AND NONELECTORAL FOUNDATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC ROTATION.THROUGH THESE LINES OF JURISPRUDENCE, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, OR CULTURAL CAPITAL IS PARLAYED INTO DISPROPORTIONATE POLITICAL POWER. THIS DOCTRINE HENCE ENTRENCHES SUCH POWER INTO A FORM OF DURABLE INCUMBENCY. THESE DECISIONS, IN OTHER WORDS, "ENCASE" EXTANT DISTRIBUTIONS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIOCULTURAL POWER FROM DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGE. DRAWING OUT THESE ELEMENTS, THIS ARTICLE MAPS OUT THE "COUNTERDEMOCRATIC DIFFICULTY" OF JUDICIAL REVIEW AS PRESENTLY EMPLOYED.
260	DISCRIMINATION POSES A THREAT TO EQUALITY AS A BASIC CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW.IN THE DIGITAL AGE, THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE IMPORTANT LEGAL DECISIONS HAS ADDED A NEW DIMENSION TO THE PROBLEM. MORE SPECIFICALLY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS CAPABLE OF MAKING FAULTY DECISIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN BASED ON DISCRIMINATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE WAS TO EXAMINE THE RISKS OF DISCRIMINATION IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR AND AVOID THEM IN FUTURE LEGAL REGULATION.THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF DOCTRINAL AND REGULATORY SOURCES FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND AN EXAMINATION OF EXISTING EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.A SPECIFIC METHOD OF DATA MINING IS PROFILING, WHICH LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND SELF-DETERMINATION.IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE THEORY OF INFORMATION SELF-DETERMINATION BE REASSESSED, EXPLOITING ITS POTENTIAL TO DIVIDE RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE DATA OWNER AND THE PROCESSOR.DUE TO THE CLEAR DISCRIMINATORY RISKS OF PROFILING, SOME OPERATIONS ARE ALREADY BANNED (E.G.REDLINING IN THE USA, GENETIC PROFILING IN INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES).THE UNDENIABLE PREDICTIVE POTENTIAL OF DATA DESERVES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PERSONALIZATION, WHERE THE PREDICTIVE ABILITIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE USED TO LEGALLY ASSESS THE BEHAVIOR OF AN INDIVIDUAL. EXPERIENCE WITH ALGORITHMIC PREDICTION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE USA CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SUGGESTS THE PROBABILISTIC NATURE OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INFRINGE HUMAN RIGHTS TO A FAIR TRIAL AND INDIVIDUALIZATION OF PUNISHMENT IF ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT BECOMES THE SOLE BASIS FOR ADJUDICATION. IN GENERAL, THE DEVELOPMENT OF APPLICATIONS TO SOLVE ROUTINE LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT WILL PRODUCE RESULTS BASED ON PAST JUDICIAL DECISIONS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN COMMON LAW COUNTRIES WHERE CASE LAW IS PREVALENT.GIVEN THAT RUSSIA BELONGS TO THE CONTINENTAL LAW SYSTEM AND THAT CASE LAW EVEN ON A ONE TYPE OF DISPUTE IS OFTEN CONTRADICTORY AND NOT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE PROSPECTS FOR USING AMERICAN EXPERIENCE ARE DOUBTFUL. CONSIDERATION OF SPECIFIC TYPES OF DEFICIENCIES THAT CAN LEAD TO DISCRIMINATORY DATA PROCESSING, NAMELY INCORRECT DATA COLLECTION, AGGREGATION OF ERRONEOUS DATA, INSENSITIVITY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO REGULATORY SETTINGS, ALLOWED DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ON THE CONTOURS OF FUTURE LEGISLATION REGARDING THE ACTIVITIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL ANALYZED RISKS OF DISCRIMINATION.
261	INCREASINGLY, THE ECONOMY OF INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES MOVES AWAY FROM BEING BASED ON A MULTIPLICITY OF INDEPENDENT INNOVATORS TO ONE CHARACTERISED BY CROSS-LICENSING AND THE POOLING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) RIGHTS. COMPETITION LAW IS ACCORDED A MORE LIMITED ROLE. REFUSALS TO LICENSE OR RESTRICTIVE LICENCE TERMS ARE TOLERATED. THIS PARADIGM EMPHASISES THE INNOVATION AT THE EXPENSE OF THE DISSEMINATION RATIONALE OF IP AND COMPETITION LAW. THE PRESSURE ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS TO FOLLOW SUIT. HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH JEOPARDISES OVERCOMING THE TECHNOLOGY DEPENDENCE OF THESE STATES. YET, THE POLITICAL CONSENSUS UNDERLYING THE AGREEMENT ON TRADE-RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (TRIPS) WAS THAT, IN EXCHANGE FOR IP RIGHTS PROTECTION, A TRANSFER AND DISSEMINATION OF TECHNOLOGY BENEFITING THE GLOBAL SOUTH WOULD OCCUR. THIS HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE SO FAR. TAKING THIS PROMISE SERIOUSLY REQUIRES ACCORDING AN ENHANCED, MORE SOCIAL ROLE TO COMPETITION LAW. ARTICLES 8(2), 31 AND 40 OF TRIPS - THE TRIPS COMPETITION RULES - COULD BE INTERPRETED IN A WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES IN FAVOUR OF A "PRODEVELOPMENT" APPROACH TO IP-RELATED COMPETITION LAW. THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS A DEMAND OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. ON THE ONE HAND, TREATIES SUCH AS TRIPS ARE TO BE INTERPRETED IN GOOD FAITH. ON THE OTHER, PUBLIC INTEREST AND HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS JUSTIFY, AS IT WERE, REQUIRE, SUCH AN APPROACH. ARTICLES 7 AND 8 OF TRIPS CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD. THEY REFLECT SUCH PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS AS "OBJECT AND PURPOSE" OF TRIPS. THEY ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW (IHRL). IHRL PROTECTS A (GROUP) RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT, CONFIRMING "POLICY SPACE" FOR WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) MEMBERS AND THE FREEDOM TO OPT FOR A COMPETITION LAW MODEL THAT FACILITATES DISSEMINATION. THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS (ICESCR) FURTHER PROTECTS VARIOUS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS AND ITS APPLICATIONS (REBSPA). THESE RIGHTS MAY BE SAID TO GIVE RISE TO "TRANSFER AND DISSEMINATION OF TECHNOLOGY" AS A HUMAN RIGHT. DUTIES UNDER THE RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT AND "TERRITORIAL" AND "EXTRATERRITORIAL" HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS (ETOS) UNDER THE ICESCR SUPPORT AN UNDERSTANDING OF COMPETITION LAW WHICH IS PRO DEVELOPMENT, WHICH TAKES ACCOUNT OF LOCAL ACCESS AND WELFARE NEEDS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A SET OF 10 CONSOLIDATED CONSIDERATIONS FOR A "PRODEVELOPMENT" IP-RELATED COMPETITION LAW.
262	TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS THE EAST INDONESIA MUJAHIDEEN, JAMAAH ANSHARUT DAULAH AND JAMAAH ANSHARUT CARRY THE POTENTIAL FOR TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM IN INDONESIA AS THEY ARE AFFILIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST NETWORKS, SUCH AS ISIS (ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND AS-SHAM), AL QAEDA, OR THE TALIBAN. FOR THIS REASON, INDONESIA IS ONE OF THE COUNTRIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TARGETED BY TERRORIST ATTACKS. AS A RESULT, IN THE EYES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THE TERRORISM MOVEMENT IN INDONESIA IS INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS AND ALMOST ALWAYS LINKED TO OVERSEAS RADICAL ISLAM GROUPS. COUPLED WITH WIDESPREAD USE OF WEBSITES FOR TERRORISM PROPAGANDA, THE CRIME OF TERRORISM IS NOT MERELY INTRANATIONAL BUT A TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM CRIME THAT IS CROSS-BORDER, BECOMING A GLOBAL THREAT TO HUMANITY WITH A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON ALL ASPECTS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AROUND THE WORLD. IN AN EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM CRIMES, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA HAS UPDATED THE LAW ON THE ERADICATION OF CRIMINAL ACTS OF TERRORISM, MOST RECENTLY WITH LAW NUMBER 5 OF 2018 CONCERNING AMENDMENTS TO LAW NUMBER 15 OF 2003 CONCERNING STIPULATION OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN LIEU OF LAW NUMBER 1 OF 2002 CONCERNING ERADICATION OF CRIMINAL ACTS OF TERRORISM.. THE ERADICATION OF TERRORISM IN THE LAW IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A LEGAL INSTRUMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF CITIZENS OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA.THIS STUDY IS AIMED TO ANALYZE THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM CRIMES. IN THAT CONTEXT, THIS STUDY IS NORMATIVE JURIDICAL RESEARCH USING A STATUTORY APPROACH. THIS STUDY SPECIFICATION IS DESCRIPTIVE-ANALYTICAL. THE DATA COLLECTED WERE THEN ANALYZED IN A QUALITATIVE NORMATIVE MANNER. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM CRIMES, THE PUNISHMENT FOCUSES MORE ON THE THEORY OF RETALIATION FOCUSING ON ARRESTS, DETENTIONS AND PUNISHMENTS OF TERRORISTS, NOT ON THE EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE RETRIBUTIVE THEORY WITH RELATIVE THEORY WITH THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF PUNISHMENT, NAMELY "PREVENTIVE, DETERRENCE, AND REFORMATIVE" BASED ON THE "RULE OF LAW" AND " LEGALITY" PRINCIPLES. FOR THIS REASON, IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM CRIMES, IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE LEGAL HARMONIZATION BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS TO PREVENT THE STATE FROM BEING PREDICATED AS A STATE OF WRONGFUL ACTS.
263	IN NOVEMBER 2013, SUZANO PAPEL E CELULOSE, A BRAZILIAN PAPER COMPANY, IS PROJECTED TO INAUGURATE THE WORLD'S LARGEST PULP MILL IN IMPERATRIZ IN THE REMOTE STATE OF MARANHAO, EASTERN AMAZON. THIS INVESTMENT WILL FURTHER CONSOLIDATE BRAZIL'S POSITION AS THE LEADING EXPORTER OF WOOD-PULP COMING FROM VAST, CORPORATE-CONTROLLED INDUSTRIAL PLANTATIONS. THESE INLAND FORESTRY INVESTMENTS ARE A FEATURE OF THE SECOND WAVE OF LARGE PULP PROJECTS, EXTENDING INLAND FROM THE BEST LANDS IN THE COASTAL BELT VIA ACCESSIBLE RIVERS AND RAILROAD NETWORKS. THIS GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT INLAND EXPANSION HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED, IF AT ALL. NO PUBLICATIONS EXIST ON THIS SUZANO PULP PROJECT. EMPIRICALLY, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A BASELINE STUDY ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMIC DYNAMICS. THE CASE IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR CONFLICT THEORY. GENERALLY, INDUSTRIAL TREE PLANTATION EXPANSION HAS BOOSTED GRIEVANCES, BUT THE RESISTANCE AND CONFLICTS HAVE VARIED DEPENDING ON THE SOCIAL ACTORS' AGENCY. IN COMPARISON TO THE HIGH-INTENSITY CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE RURAL SOCIAL MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE BRAZILIAN LANDLESS MOVEMENT (MST) AND THE PULP COMPANIES IN MOST OTHER NEW INVESTMENTS, THERE HAS BEEN A RARE ABSENCE OF CONFLICT IN THIS CASE, AS NO MOVEMENT HAS SEIZED ON LOCAL GRIEVANCES. CONFLICTS CANNOT BE STUDIED IN-DEPTH BY FOCUSING ONLY ON CONFLICT CASES. ABSENCE-CASES OPEN UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THE QUESTION WHY CONFLICTS ARISE. AN ANALYSIS OF THIS CASE ALLOWS AN EMPIRICALLY ROOTED THEORETICAL DISCUSSION ON CONFLICT CAUSALITIES, WHICH CAN ANSWER SEVERAL VEXING QUESTIONS IN THE STUDY OF CONFLICTS. A NEW AND GENERALLY APPLICABLE TYPOLOGY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRIEVANCES IS OFFERED, AND THE GRIEVANCES' CAUSAL RELATION TO CONFLICTS IS EXAMINED. THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL DYNAMICS AND INTER-PERSONAL RELATIONS IN INVESTMENT CONFLICTS IS EMPHASIZED. THE WAY CULTURE INFLUENCES CONFLICT DYNAMICS IS PONDERED UPON BY ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE BRAZILIAN CONFLICT CULTURE, WHERE PERSONAL RELATIONS ARE MORE RELEVANT IN EXPLAINING CONFLICT ESCALATION THAN IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS WITH A STRONGER (IMPERSONAL) RULE OF LAW. THE ROLE OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS OTHER INDUSTRIES IN THE INVESTMENT AREA IS DISCUSSED. A QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MAJOR PULP PROJECT CONFLICTS AND THEIR CAUSES IN LATIN AMERICA IS OFFERED. MOBILIZATION AND THUS CONFLICT CAUSALITY IS EXPLAINABLE ONLY WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPES OF GRIEVANCES AND THE LOCAL, INTER-PERSONAL, AND ORGANIZATIONAL (STATE-BUSINESS-MOVEMENT) RELATIONS BY WHICH THESE ARE REMEDIATED AND NEGOTIATED.

264	BACKGROUNDAWARENESS OF RIGHTS IS A PRECONDITION TO ESTABLISHING RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY. SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND RIGHTS (SRHR) ARE CLOSELY KNITTED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AS THEY OVERLAP WITH OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND LIFE. HOWEVER, AWARENESS ABOUT THESE RIGHTS REMAINS A CHALLENGE. CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE RIGHTS THIS STUDY HAS MEASURED THE AWARENESS OF ADOLESCENTS ABOUT SRHR IN BAHAWALPUR (DIVISION) OF PAKISTAN. METHODOLOGYWE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN THE DIVISON OF BAHAWALPUR, PAKISTAN FROM OCTOBER 2019 TO DECEMBER 2019. THE STUDY INCLUDED A SAMPLE SIZE OF 500 RESPONDENTS WHICH INCLUDED 250 YOUNG FEMALES OF AGE 15-19 AND 250 THEIR PARENTS (MOTHER). THE REASONING BEHIND INCLUDING ONLY FEMALES IN THIS STUDY WAS THE INCREASED VULNERABILITY AND GREATER IMPACT OF SRHR IN THEIR LIFE COMPARED TO MALES. THE AGE RANGE 15-19 WAS PRIMARILY SELECTED AS FEMALES THIS AGE WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE COMPARED TO FEMALES IN THEIR EARLY ADOLESCENT YEARS. THE QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING TWO-STAGE CLUSTER SAMPLING. DETAILED STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE RESPONDENTS TO OBTAIN THEIR POINTS OF VIEW ON THE AWARENESS OF SRHR. THE POPULATION WAS DIVIDED INTO MULTI-CLUSTERS WITH 25 HOUSEHOLDS COMPRISING 250 HOUSEHOLDS FOR THE DIVISION OF BAHAWALPUR. THE INFORMATION WAS ALSO GATHERED FROM THE DOCTORS AND THE TEACHERS THROUGH INTERVIEWS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 21. RESULTSTHE STUDY EXPLORED THE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF ADOLESCENT SRHR THEREBY HIGHLIGHTING THE KEY RESTRICTIONS IN BAHAWALPUR, PAKISTAN, WHICH PROHIBIT ADOLESCENTS FROM GAINING ACCESS TO SRHR AND EXERCISING IT. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ADOLESCENTS WHO STRONGLY AGREED WITH THE IMPORTANCE AND AWARENESS LEVEL AND THINK THEY SHOULD BE MORE AWARE OF INFORMATION REGARDING SRHR. HOWEVER, THEY ARE OF THE VIEW THAT THEY ARE LESS INDEPENDENT IN PRACTICING THEM. CONCLUSIONTHE STUDY FOUND A LOW LEVEL OF AWARENESS ABOUT SRHR AMONG YOUNG FEMALE AND THEIR PARENTS IN BAHAWALPUR, PAKISTAN. IT IS A NEED OF TIME AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAWALPUR REGION TO DEVISE CLEAR AND PROPER POLICIES WHICH GIVE ACCESS TO THESE RIGHTS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY INCLUDING THE INFORMATION ON THESE RIGHTS IN THE COURSE CURRICULUM AND TEACHERS KEEPING IN VIEW THE CULTURAL AND REGIONAL RESTRICTIONS THAT GUIDE THE YOUNG FEMALE ABOUT SRHR.
265	RESEARCH QUESTION/ISSUE EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND HAVE SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW COMPARED WITH EXECUTIVES WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH A BACKGROUND. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW EXECUTIVES WHO ARE WELL INFORMED OF THE LAW CAN REDUCE STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK AND HOW THIS IS SIGNIFICANT FROM A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE. RESEARCH FINDINGS/INSIGHTS WE COLLECTED AND EVALUATED 23,031 FIRM-YEAR OBSERVATIONS FROM 2008 TO 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: (1) EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK. (2) WHEN THE COMPANY'S EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL SUPERVISION IS WEAK, THE EFFECT OF EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND IN REDUCING STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK IS PARTICULARLY PROMINENT. (3) THE EXECUTIVES' ABILITY TO REDUCE STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK IS PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS WHEN THE COMPANY'S INTENTION TO HIDE BAD NEWS IS LOW OR WHEN THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF THE BAD NEWS BEING LEAKED. THEORETICAL/ACADEMIC IMPLICATIONS STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM TO ADDRESS IN THE CHINESE CAPITAL MARKET. THE PREVAILING EXPLANATION FOR CRASH RISK EMPHASIZES EXECUTIVES' CONCEALMENT OF BAD NEWS AS A PRIMARY FACTOR. SINCE THE SUPPRESSION OF BAD NEWS BY COMPANY EXECUTIVES IS THE MAIN REASON FOR STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK, OBSERVING THE INFLUENCE OF EXECUTIVES ON THIS RISK IS A VIABLE DIRECT APPROACH. EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND, IN PARTICULAR, HAVE A CRITICAL INFLUENCE ON COMPANIES. THEY POSSESS A SUPERIOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE SUCH A BACKGROUND AND ARE MORE WILLING TO RESPECT AND ABIDE BY THE LAW. AS A RESULT, THEY HAVE A LOWER TOLERANCE FOR INAPPROPRIATE ACTS BY THE EXECUTIVE TEAM, NAMELY, CONCEALING BAD NEWS, WHICH REDUCES THE RISK OF STOCK PRICE CRASH. PRACTITIONER/POLICY IMPLICATIONS IN CHINA, THE WORLD'S LARGEST TRANSITIONAL ECONOMY, INVESTOR PROTECTION AND INFORMATION ENVIRONMENTS ARE STILL DEVELOPING. COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED REGULATIONS CAN ADOPT SUBSTITUTIVE MECHANISMS, SUCH AS MAKING THE EMPLOYMENT OF EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND MANDATORY, TO FACILITATE THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CAPITALIST MARKETS. GIVEN THE CAPACITY OF THESE EXECUTIVES TO REDUCE STOCK PRICE CRASH RISK, THEREBY SUPPORTING CONTINUOUS AND STABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CAPITAL MARKET, REGULATORY AUTHORITIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE LISTED COMPANIES TO HIRE EXECUTIVES WITH A LEGAL BACKGROUND. FURTHERMORE, THEY SHOULD ALSO START IN-DEPTH PROMOTION OF AND EDUCATION ON THE RULE OF LAW AMONG EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE THEIR LEGAL COMPETENCE.
266	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, DECISION-MAKING POWERS, AND POLICY-MAKING FUNCTIONS OF COMPETITION AUTHORITIES RAISES A DIVERSE RANGE OF COMPLEX ISSUES. THESE INCLUDE HOW THE AUTHORITY'S INDEPENDENCE CAN BE SAFEGUARDED, HOW IT IS FUNDED, HOW TO OPTIMIZE RESOURCES, HOW TO AVOID CONFORMATION BIAS, HOW TO RELATE WITH NON-COMPETITION AUTHORITIES (E. G., SECTORAL REGULATORS WITH CONCURRENT POWERS OR OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION), AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JUDICIARY. THIS ARTICLE STARTS FROM THE OPTIMISTIC-NOT TO MENTION EXTREMELY PRESUMPTUOUS-POSITION OF TRYING TO USE THE CONCEPTS OF NATURAL JUSTICE AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AS DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AS SOMETHING OF A TEMPLATE FOR GOOD PRACTICE AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN IN COMPETITION LAW DECISION-MAKING AND APPEALS GENERALLY. APART FROM FAMILIARITY (FROM THE AUTHORS' PERSPECTIVE), THERE ARE SOME GOOD REASONS TO DO SO. FIRST, OUTSIDE THE REALMS OF ANTIQUITY, THE UNITED KINGDOM CAN LAY A FAIR CLAIM TO POPULARIZING THE NOTION OF A RULE OF LAW. SECOND, THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST PROMINENT ADOPTERS OF A SYSTEM OF ADVERSARIAL JUSTICE WHERE THE ABILITY TO CHALLENGE EVIDENCE REMAINS PARAMOUNT. THIRD, THE COMMON LAW IS CHARACTERIZED AS MUCH BY PRAGMATISM AS STRICT PRINCIPLE. THE COMMON LAW HAS DEVELOPED AN ADAPTABLE, RATHER THAN RULES-BASED, APPROACH TO NATURAL JUSTICE. AS A RESULT WE CONSIDER THAT IT IS A USEFUL RESOURCE WHEN CONSIDERING INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND OPERATION OF COMPETITION AUTHORITIES. THE LAW DEVELOPS IN REAL TIME, AND NOT FROM THE BASIS OF AN HISTORIC CODE. FOURTH, IN RESPECT OF COMPETITION LAW SPECIFICALLY, A FAIRLY RICH BODY OF CASE LAW HAS DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AROUND PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE, PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, AND THE USE OF EVIDENCE. THAT CASE LAW CERTAINLY APPEARS RICHER THAN THE CORRESPONDING CASE LAW OF THE EU COURTS IN LUXEMBOURG. FINALLY, THE UNITED KINGDOM HAS ITSELF UNDERGONE MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM OF ITS VARIOUS COMPETITION AUTHORITIES, MOST NOTABLY BY THE CREATION OF THE COMPETITION AND MARKETS AUTHORITY, EFFECTIVE FROM APRIL 1, 2014. THIS SIGNIFICANT EXERCISE PROMPTED A PERIOD OF INTROSPECTION AS TO WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRACTICES APPLIED BY THE COMPETITION AUTHORITIES FOR THE PREVIOUS DECADES COULD BE IMPROVED OR ADAPTED. THE RESULTING GUIDANCE AND RELATED DOCUMENTS THAT EMERGED MIGHT THEREFORE FAIRLY BE CONSIDERED TO BE THE STATE OF THE ART IN THESE MATTERS.
267	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE PROBLEM OF THE CRIMINAL LAW UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSMENT OF INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM THAT ENTAILED DEATH OF THE VICTIM, AND DELIMITATION OF THE COMPOSITION OF OTHER RELATED SOCIALLY DANGEROUS ACTS. QUALIFICATION OF CRIMES AS A PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING AND LEGAL CONFIRMATION OF THE IDENTITY BETWEEN THE SIGNS OF A COMMITTED CRIME AND SIGNS OF A PARTICULAR CRIME, AS WELL AS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CRIMES, IS A DEBATABLE QUESTION IN THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF CRIMINAL LAW. OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE IS QUALIFICATION OF SOCIALLY DANGEROUS ACTS (INCLUDING VIOLENT ATTACKS ON HUMAN LIFE AND HEALTH) THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS CONTAINED IN THE RELEVANT PLENARY SESSIONS AND PRACTICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SUBJECTS DUE TO MISINTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE LAW AS A WHOLE. LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROVISIONS OF CRIMINAL LAW, OF THE ABILITY TO APPLY THIS KNOWLEDGE IN PRACTICE, COMPETENT CRIME QUALIFICATION IS IMPOSSIBLE. WITHOUT COMPETENT CRIME QUALIFICATION ONE CAN NOT ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE, THE INEVITABILITY OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PUNISHMENT, INDIVIDUALIZATION OF PUNISHMENT AND HUMANISM IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME. THUS, KNOWLEDGE OF CRIMINAL LAW AND THE ABILITY TO APPLY CORRECT LEGAL STANDARDS CONTRIBUTES TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ACTIVITIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (THE INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE, THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE). GIVEN THE SPECIAL FEATURES AND CRIMINOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF VIOLENT CRIMES (A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLIC DANGER, DESTRUCTION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS), CORRECT APPLICATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW RULES IN CRIME QUALIFICATION IS REASONABLY NECESSARY. THROUGH THE STUDY OF LEGAL LITERATURE AND CASE LAW, THE AUTHOR SHOWS THE MAIN MISTAKES MADE BY THE INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES, AND OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CORRECT QUALIFICATION OF CRIMES. IN THE COURSE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW ASSESSMENT OF CRIMINAL ACTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CRIMINAL LAW DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT VIOLENT CRIMES (MURDER, INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM, CAUSING DEATH BY NEGLIGENCE) HAVE ADJACENT SIGNS RELATED TO THE OBJECT, OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE SIDES. A CERTAIN ROLE IN THE DELIMITATION OF CRIMES BELONGS TO THE SUBJECTIVE SIDE, AS WELL AS TO SOME OTHER SIGNS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE OBJECTIVE SIDE OF THESE CRIMES, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE.
268	THE PAPER DEALS WITH THE ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ON THE INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT. WITH PURPOSES TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SCIENTIFIC DIRECTIONS OF ANALYSIS AMONG THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, THE AUTHORS DID THE BIBLIOMETRIC STUDY. FOR THE REVIEWS, THE AUTHORS SELECTED 1167 PAPERS WHICH INDEXING IN SCOPUS. FOR THE VISUALISING THE FINDINGS OF BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS, THE VOSVIEWER WAS USED. THE RESULTS ALLOW ALLOCATING 10 CLUSTERS OF SCIENTIFIC DIRECTIONS WHICH ANALYSED THE ISSUES OF INNOVATIONS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS. THE FIRST MOST SIGNIFICANT CLUSTERS COULD "INNOVATION" ANALYSED THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THROUGH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INNOVATION IMPLEMENTATION. THE SECOND CLUSTERS CONNECTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT INNOVATION POLICY AND LOCATED CLOSE TO THE FIRST CLUSTERS. THE THIRD CLUSTER "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION" INVOLVED 40 ITEMS AND 4699 LINKS. THE SCIENTISTS WITH ITALIAN AND AMERICAN AFFILIATIONS HAD THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHARES OF PAPERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EUROPEAN FUNDING ALLOCATED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF FINANCING SUCH RESEARCH. THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE INVESTIGATION WAS CHECKING THE LINKING BETWEEN LEVELS OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT AND COUNTRIES' RATING ON THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION USING THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND LEAST SQUARE MODEL. FOR THE CHECKING HYPOTHESIS, THE AUTHORS USED THE SOFTWARE EVIEWS11. THE AUTHORS ANALYSED THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AS THE BASE INDICATORS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EFFICIENCY. FOR THE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS USED DATA FOR EU COUNTRIES AND UKRAINE. AS UKRAINE HAS STARTED THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, THE UKRAINIAN POLICY SHOULD BE SYNCHRONISED WITH THE EU. THE FINDINGS PROVED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN VARIABLES. THUS, THE INCREASING OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND THE RULE OF LAW LEAD TO INCREASING BY 0,094 AND 0,043 POINTS THE LEVEL OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY CORRESPONDING. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INCREASING REGULATION POLICY PROVOKE THE INCREASE OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT BY 0,08 POINTS. THE LESS IMPACT HAD THE VARIABLES AS FOLLOWS: SUSTAINABILITY COMPETITIVENESS OF THE COUNTRY AND VOLUME OF EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. AFTER ANALYSIS OF THE EMPIRICAL DATA, THE REVIEWS OF THE MANAGEMENT AND LEGAL INSTRUMENTS WAS DONE. CONSIDERING THE EU EXPERIENCE, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED THE SYSTEM OF TOOLS WHICH LEAD TO INCREASING OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION EFFICIENCY AS FOLLOWS: LEGISLATION ON PROPERTY RIGHTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION DIRECTIVES, DIGITALISATION OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AT ALL LEVELS. FOR THE FUTURE INVESTIGATION, THE TIME AND RANGE OF THE COUNTRIES SHOULD BE EXTENDED.
269	THE ADB GROUP, WITH ITS DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP (SEVENTEEN REGIONAL MEMBER COUNTRIES AND TWENTY-FOUR NON-REGIONAL MEMBER COUNTRIES) PROVIDES A PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE SETTING IN WHICH TO SITUATE THE ISSUE OF LEGAL HARMONISATION IN AFRICA. THE ADB WAS SET UP TO "PROMOTE SOCIAL PROGRESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN ITS REGIONAL MEMBER STATES BOTH COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY." THE BANK PROVIDES MULTINATIONAL INVESTMENT FINANCE AND AIMS AT DEVELOPING INTER-AFRICAN TRADE BY MEANS OF OPEN REGIONAL MARKETS AND THE RATIONAL AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF THE CONTINENT'S NATURAL RESOURCES, IN PARTICULAR THROUGH THE PROMOTION OF REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE AIMS, AND INDEED IN ALL THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN OR SUPPORTED BY THE BANK, PROMINENCE IS GIVEN TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE HARMONISATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE BANK IS ENGAGED UPON SEVERAL INITIATIVES IN THIS CONNECTION, SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT OF WHICH INCLUDE: 1. ITS LAW FOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY, WHICH STRESSES REGIONAL INTEGRATION THROUGH THE HARMONISATION OF COMMERCIAL LEGISLATION; 2. SUPPORT FOR THE CREATION OF THE AFRICAN LAW INSTITUTE, SET UP TO PROVIDE A CENTRE OF PROFESSIONAL EXCELLENCE, A THINK-TANK, AND A RESEARCH CENTRE AIMING, IN PARTICULAR, AT THE HARMONISATION OF ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS LAW IN AFRICA, WITH A MODEL LAW ON INVESTMENT IN AFRICA NOW IN THE PIPELINE; AND 3. FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR OHADA, IN PARTICULAR FOR THE REINFORCEMENT OF THE COMMON COURT OF JUSTICE AND ARBITRATION (CCJA). AS TO OHADA'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, THE ADB IS WELL PLEASED WITH THE WORK ALREADY DONE, BUT EMPHASISES THAT A NUMBER OF FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS ARE STILL NEEDED BEFORE OHADA CAN BECOME A TRULY "PAN-AFRICAN" INSTITUTION. SUCH REFORMS SHOULD INCLUDE THE JUDICIOUS INCORPORATION OF PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW, AND THE INCLUSION OF ENGLISH, PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH AS OHADA WORKING LANGUAGES. MOREOVER, OHADA SHOULD COLLABORATE WITH OTHER AFRICAN REGIONAL INTEGRATION ORGANISATIONS WITH A VIEW TO RATIONALISING THE WORKLOAD INVOLVED IN LEGAL HARMONISATION AT THE CONTINENTAL LEVEL. THE PRELIMINARY DRAFT UNIFORM ACT ON CONTRACT LAW IS OF ESPECIAL INTEREST TO THE BANK IN THAT ITS CHIEF AIM IS TO HARMONISE CONCEPTS OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF CONTRACTS EVOLVED BY THE ROMAN-GERMANIC TRADITION ON THE ONE HAND AND BY THE ANGLO-SAXON SYSTEM ON THE OTHER HAND. THE BANK PARTICULARLY WELCOMES THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A POTENTIALLY HARMONISED CONTRACT LAW ON ITS OWN LOAN AND INVESTMENT OPERATIONS IN ADB MEMBER COUNTRIES.
270	TRANSLATIONS, IMITATIONS AND ADAPTATIONS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE LITERARY PROCESS AND ITS DYNAMICS. THEREFORE, S.I. VISKOVATOV'S IMITATION OF 1810 AND A.P. SUMAROKOV'S ALTERATION OF 1748 OCCUPY A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE RECEPTION OF SHAKESPEARE'S TRAGEDY HAMLET IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THESE TWO INDEPENDENT WORKS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PRESENCE OF SHAKESPEARE'S TEXT IN THEM, AS WELL AS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF REFLECTING THE AESTHETIC FEATURES OF THE HISTORICAL AND LITERARY PROCESS IN THEM. THE PATHOS OF SUMAROKOV'S TRAGEDY, AS MID-CENTURY CLASSICISM SUGGESTS, IS MORAL AND POLITICAL. ALL ACTION IN THE TEXT IS DUE TO THE SITUATION OF VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LEGITIMACY OF POWER. POLITICAL CONFLICT IS THE BASIS FOR THE CLASSIC CONFLICT OF DUTY AND FEELING. HAMLET TURNS OUT TO BE A SUITABLE MATERIAL FOR JUDGMENTS ABOUT RUSSIAN TOPICAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS. IN THE CASE OF SUMAROKOV'S ALTERATION, THE METHOD OF INTERACTION WITH FOREIGN MATERIAL IS USED THROUGH THE SEPARATION OF THE PLOT FROM THE POETICS. EXISTENTIAL INTIMATE CRISES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DOMINANT CLASSICISM ARE TRANSFORMED INTO COLLECTIVE CATEGORIES - THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE. SUCH TRANSFORMATIONS REFLECT THE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE LITERARY PROCESS OF THE ERA AND THE SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT. VISKOVATOV'S IMITATIVENESS CONSISTS RATHER IN CONVEYING THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY ENGLISH LITERATURE - PRIMARILY SENTIMENTALIST IN THIS PERIOD. THE SENTIMENTAL POETICS OF TRAGEDY-IMITATION IS DETERMINED, ON THE ONE HAND, BY THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN LITERATURE ON RUSSIAN LITERATURE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE RUSSIAN HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL PROCESS PROPER ON LITERATURE COMING FROM OUTSIDE. EXISTING IN THE SPACE OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE, THE TRAGEDY ALSO HAS FEATURES OF CLASSICISM. IN VISKOVATOV'S TRAGEDY-IMITATION, RUSSIAN EDIFYING CLASSICISM COEXIST EQUALLY, WITH A DOMINANT POLITICAL CONFLICT AND THE THEME OF THE USURPATION OF POWER, AND RUSSIAN "CEMETERY" SENTIMENTALISM, WHICH DREW ATTENTION TO THE STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN FEELINGS. SO, WE CAN SAY THAT THE FIRST TWO RUSSIAN HAMLETS MEET THE AESTHETIC AND IDEOLOGICAL NEEDS OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY, AND DO NOT ACQUAINT READERS WITH ENGLISH LITERATURE. WHEN WORKING WITH FOREIGN MATERIAL, THE AUTHORS STRIVE TO ADAPT THE WORK TO THE SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF THE RUSSIAN READING SOCIETY AND INTEGRATE THE WORK INTO THE SYSTEM OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE.
271	THIS ARTICLE INTERROGATES THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE OLDER PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT AND POLITICS IN ZIMBABWE. THE COUNTRY CONTINUES TO FACE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND A BREAKDOWN IN RULE OF LAW. THE ZIMBABWEAN POPULACE IS ASKING WHETHER THE ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT IS READY AND ABLE TO EXERCISE ITS PROPHETIC ROLE IN PROMOTING REAL PEACE AND DEMOCRACY. MANY ZIMBABWEANS ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE THE TRACK RECORD SHOWS THAT WHILST MOST MAINLINE CHURCHES HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN BECOMING THE VOICE OF THE VOICELESS, SOME ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE FENCE FOR TOO LONG BY ADOPTING A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD STANCE, THEREBY AVOIDING A HEAD-ON CONFRONTATION WITH THE CORRUPT ZIMBABWE AFRICAN NATIONAL UNION-PATRIOTIC FRONT (ZANU-PF) GOVERNMENT. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT FOR MANY DECADES THE ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT HAS TAKEN WHAT ONE MIGHT REFER TO IRONICALLY AS A `SMART APPROACH TO POLITICS'-IN WHICH THE IMAGE OF THE ZANUPF GOVERNMENT IS SANITISED BY ESPOUSING WHAT I CALL A `SPIRITUALISED POLITICAL THEOLOGY.' I USE THIS CRITIQUE, WHILST REMAINING COGNISANT OF THE FACT THAT THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION OF THE MOVEMENT ON WHICH I FOCUS IN THIS ARTICLE, WAS EVANGELISM, NOT POLITICS. THUS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH, THE ZIMBABWE ASSEMBLIES OF GOD AFRICA (ZAOGA) OF APOSTLE EZEKIEL GUTI WAS SAMPLED TO INVESTIGATE ITS PROPHETIC VOICE IN A POLARISED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE HISTORY OF APOSTLE GUTI'S POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE BASED ON THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS PASTORAL LETTERS REFERRED TO AS THE `TEN-DAYS PRAYER LETTERS' ISSUED SINCE 1975 UP TO THE TIME OF WRITING THIS ARTICLE. IT IS IMPORTANT AT THIS EARLY STAGE TO OUTLINE THAT THESE LETTERS WERE NOT POLITICAL STATEMENTS OR MEANT TO ADDRESS POLITICS ONLY BUT THEOLOGICAL LETTERS ADDRESSING DIFFERENT SOCIAL ILLS INCLUDING POLITICS. THUS, READING THIS LETTER ONE SHALL SEE THAT APOSTLE'S POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE DEMONSTRATED A CONTINUOUS OSCILLATION OF A THEOLOGICAL POSITION ON HOW THE CHURCH SHOULD RELATE TO POLITICS. FURTHERMORE, I UNDERTAKE A BRIEF EXAMINATION OF OTHER FEW MILLENNIAL ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL CHURCHES TO SEE IF THIS POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE TRANSCENDED ELSEWHERE THEREBY PROPAGATING A SPIRITUALISED POLITICAL THEOLOGY. CONTRIBUTION: WHAT IS KEY TO NOTE IS THE FACT THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT REMAINED INSIGNIFICANT WITH REGARD TO DEMOCRATIZATION AGENDA EVEN AFTER THE REMOVAL OF PRESIDENT MUGABE. THE ABOVE CLAIM IS EVIDENCED BY THE ZIMBABWEAN PENTECOSTAL CHURCH FOUNDERS' CONTINUOUS POLITICAL SUBTERFUGE AUTHENTICATED BY A PROPAGATION OF A SPIRITUALIZED POLITICAL THEOLOGY.
272	AT THE END OF THE 18TH CENTURY IN RUSSIA CASTE SYSTEM OF THE JUDICIARY WAS LEGALIZED. FOR URBAN AND SUBURBAN TRADE AND CRAFT POPULATION OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE ESTATES COURTS WERE MAGISTRATES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF MAGISTRATES ARE STUDIED BY NATIVE HISTORIANS AND LEGAL SCHOLARS, REGIONAL ASPECTS OF THE TOPIC ARE NOT ADEQUATELY REFLECTED. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ACTIVITIES OF THE TSARITSYN CITY MAGISTRATE COURT AS AN ESTATES COURT FOR A MERCHANT AND PETTY-BOURGEOIS POPULATION OF THE CITY OF TSARITSYN IN 1784-1866. IN 1775 EKATERINA II CARRIED OUT A MAJOR REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE COURT, SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING THE FUNCTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, AND, IN FACT, RESTORING ESTATES OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. FROM THAT MOMENT IN CITIES THE MAGISTRATES MANAGED THE CITY, INCLUDING CITY MAGISTRATES WHO REPRESENTED THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE IN CRIMINAL AND CIVIL CASES FOR THE URBAN POPULATION - MERCHANTS, CRAFTSMEN, TOWNSPEOPLE. APPEAL TO THE CITY MAGISTRATE WAS OF THE SARATOV PROVINCIAL MAGISTRATE. DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HIS FUNCTIONAL FEATURES AND RELATIONS WITH ANOTHER OFFICIAL INSTANCES ARE PRESENTED. THE LIMITS OF THE JURISDICTION OF THE TSARITSYN CITY MAGISTRATE WAS LIMITED TO THE TERRITORY OF TSARITSYN. THE OBJECTS OF THE JURISDICTION COULD BE ONLY THE REGULAR CITIZENS, I.E. ASSIGNED TO THE CITY, AND NOT THE ENTIRE POPULATION. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY THE APPLICATION OF PENALTIES IN THE MATERIAL PRESENTED IN THE ASPECT OF NOT ONLY THE ALL-RUSSIAN LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, BUT ALSO REGARDING REGIONAL SOCIAL AND LEGAL ASSESSMENTS. TSARITSYN CITY MAGISTRATE HEARD CASES OF THEFT, VANDALISM, RAPE, FALSE RECEIPTS, AND BILLS OF EXCHANGE, UNAUTHORIZED OCCUPATION OF URBAN LAND, ABANDONED CHILDREN, THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DEVIATIONS FROM THE CANONS OF ORTHODOXY, COMMITTING A SCHISMATIC RITES, VIOLATION OF RULES OF TRANSPORTATION AND LOGGING, CONCEALMENT OF RECRUITS, ABOUT THE INSULT OF THE AUTHORITIES. HERE IS THE STUDY OF PRACTICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HISTORICAL, SOCIAL, RELIGIOUS, CULTURAL AND ETHNIC FEATURES OF THE REGION. THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION IS FIXED ON THE FUNCTIONALITY OF LOCAL INSTITUTIONS IN A CHANGING SOCIAL AND LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY AND ITS REGIONS. THE MAIN STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS THE MAGISTRATE STATIONERY WAS RECORDS MANAGEMENT. THE TRIAL DIFFERED EXTENSIVE PAPERWORK, LOTS REVISEWISE AND APPELLATE COURTS, EXCLUSION OF THE PARTIES FROM THE PROCESS. THESE CHARACTERISTICS, CONSTRAINTS AND DELAY THE PROCEEDINGS, LED TO THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE MID-NINETEENTH CENTURY.
273	THE TYPICAL FEDERAL AGENCY ISSUES A VAST AMOUNT OF GUIDANCE, ADVISING THE PUBLIC ON HOW IT PLANS TO EXERCISE DISCRETION AND INTERPRET LAW. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT (APA), THE AGENCY MUST FOLLOW ONEROUS PROCEDURES TO ISSUE FULL-BLOWN REGULATIONS (INCLUDING NOTICE AND COMMENT) BUT CAN ISSUE GUIDANCE FAR MORE EASILY. WHAT JUSTIFIES THIS DIFFERENCE, IN THE FAMILIAR TELLING, IS THAT GUIDANCE IS NOT BINDING IN THE WAY REGULATIONS ARE. AGENCIES ARE SUPPOSED TO USE GUIDANCE FLEXIBLY. BUT CRITICS CLAIM THAT AGENCIES ARE NOT FLEXIBLE-INSTEAD THEY FOLLOW GUIDANCE RIGIDLY AND THUS PRESSURE REGULATED PARTIES TO DO THE SAME. IF TRUE, THIS CLAIM MEANS AGENCIES CAN ISSUE DE FACTO REGULATIONS SIMPLY BY CALLING THEM GUIDANCE, THREATENING TO MAKE A DEAD LETTER OF THE APA'S CONSTRAINTS. I EVALUATE THIS CLAIM FROM A QUALITATIVE EMPIRICAL PERSPECTIVE, DRAWING UPON INTERVIEWS I CONDUCTED WITH 135 INDIVIDUALS ACROSS GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, AND NGOS IN EIGHT DIFFERENT REGULATORY FIELDS. I MAKE THREE FINDINGS. FIRST, THE CRITICS HAVE A GENUINE BASIS FOR THEIR CLAIM. REGULATED PARTIES OFTEN FACE OVERWHELMING PRESSURE TO FOLLOW GUIDANCE, AND AGENCIES ARE SOMETIMES INFLEXIBLE. SECOND, PRESSURE AND INFLEXIBILITY, THOUGH REAL, ARE NOT UNIVERSAL. ONE CAN IDENTIFY REGULATED PARTIES WHO FEEL LITTLE PRESSURE AND AGENCIES WHO ARE OPEN-MINDED THE DEGREE OF PRESSURE AND INFLEXIBILITY CAN BE PREDICTED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONAL AND LEGAL FACTORS THAT ARE PRESENT IN SOME REGULATORY SCHEMES BUT NOT OTHERS. THIRD, EVEN WHEN REGULATED PARTIES ARE STRONGLY PRESSURED, OR WHEN OFFICIALS ARE INFLEXIBLE, THIS IS NORMALLY NOT BECAUSE AGENCY OFFICIALS ARE ENGAGED IN A BAD-FAITH EFFORT TO COERCE THE PUBLIC WITHOUT LAWFUL PROCEDURES. THE SOURCES OF PRESSURE ON REGULATED PARTIES ARE MOSTLY HARD-WIRED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE REGULATORY SCHEMES CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED AND ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF AGENCY OFFICIALS WHO ISSUE OR ADMINISTER GUIDANCE. AND WHEN AGENCIES ARE INFLEXIBLE IN THE FACE OF A REGULATED PARTY'S PLEA TO DEPART FROM GUIDANCE, THAT IS USUALLY BECAUSE (A) OFFICIALS FACE COMPETING PRESSURES FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO BEHAVE CONSISTENTLY AND PREDICTABLY- PRESSURES THAT SPRING FROM RULE-OF-LAW VALUES THAT AGENCIES WOULD BE REMISS TO IGNORE; AND (B) OFFICIALS ARE TRAPPED BY ORGANIZATIONAL TENDENCIES THAT CAUSE RIGIDITY, WHICH THE OFFICIALS DO NOT INTEND BUT CANNOT REDRESS WITHOUT COSTLY REFORMS. THE PROBLEM WITH GUIDANCE, THOUGH REAL, IS LARGELY AN INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM THAT CALLS FOR AN INSTITUTIONAL-REFORM RESPONSE, NOT A PROBLEM OF BUREAUCRATIC BAD FAITH THAT CALLS FOR ACCUSATION AND BLAME.
274	THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE, ON THE BASIS OF THE RATIONAL ANALYSIS PROPOSED BY KELSEN AND THE VIENNA SCHOOL, WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS THAT DETERMINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL LOCATION OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ITS RELATIONS WITH JURISDICTION AND GOVERNMENT? WE WILL ANALYZE THE THEORY OF FREE EVALUATION, AS A CRITERION OF DELIMITATION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE, JUDICIAL AND GOVERNANCE FUNCTIONS AND ASSESS PROPOSALS FOR THE DELIMITATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS AND THEIR POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GUARANTEE OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL, BASED ON THE CRITERION OF THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP. AS A RESULT, WE CAN SAY THAT THE ELEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL LEGAL PROTECTION IS AN APPROPRIATE CRITERION FOR CARRYING OUT A CLASSIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE ON THE BASIS OF ITS VARIOUS NATURE. THE CONCEPTS OF INDIVIDUAL INTEREST AND OF GENERAL INTEREST ARE DECISIVE IN THE DIFFERENT AREA OF ASSESSMENT, THAT IS, OF THE FREE PLAY SPACE THAT REMAINS FROM THE HIGHER STANDARD AND, AT THE SAME TIME, FUNCTION AS A REFERENCE POINT TO THE SOURCES OF DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, OF WHAT IS TYPICAL OF PUBLIC OPINION AND THE GENERAL WILL OR SPHERE OF FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL, SO FINALLY, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE MATTERS REFERRED TO IN THE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE STATE AND ITS RELATIONS OF DEPENDENCY, INDEPENDENCE OR COORDINATION. AS REGARDS THE MATERIAL IDENTITY BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL FUNCTION, WE NOTE THAT THE ELEMENT WHICH ALLOWS THE DELIMITATION BETWEEN SUCH FUNCTIONS DERIVES FROM THE NATURE OF THE PROTECTED LEGAL GOOD. IN SHORT, CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS RELATE TO LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS IN WHICH, ON THE ONE HAND, AN INDIVIDUAL LEGAL INTEREST IS AFFECTED, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE A DIVERSE JUSTIFICATION, WHICH LIES IN THE PROTECTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL INTEREST, IN THE FORMER AND IN A GENERAL INTEREST IN THE LATTER TWO. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL INTEREST, WHICH IS AN ELEMENT OF ALL THESE FUNCTIONS, THERE IS NO MATERIAL JUSTIFICATION FOR ITS DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONAL LOCATION, ESPECIALLY IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH REGARD TO THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. IN OUR VIEW, NOT ONLY MATTERS BEFORE THE JURISDICTION OF JUDGES, BUT ANY ACTION BY THE STATE WHICH RESULTS IN AN AFFECTATION OF INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS MUST BE PROTECTED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF SUBJECTION ONLY TO THE LAW AND BY THE GUARANTEE OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
275	TWO GROWING LITERATURES CRITIQUE HOBBESIAN CORPORATE CULTURES. MANAGEMENT ANALYSES DOCUMENT THE WAY HIGH-STAKES/ZERO-SUM BONUS SYSTEMS UNDERMINE, RATHER THAN ENHANCE, PRODUCTIVITY AS THEY SUBVERT TEAMWORK, VALORIZE SELF-INTERESTED BEHAVIOR, AND WEAKEN ETHICAL STANDARDS. THIS LITERATURE TREATS NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SUCH SYSTEMS, INCLUDING LAWLESS AND UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR, AS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF EFFORTS TO SHAKE UP COMPLACENT INSTITUTIONS OR REPLACE AN INSULAR OLD GUARD WITH AN AMBITIOUS AND MERITOCRATIC NEW WORKFORCE. A SECOND, DARKER LITERATURE TERMS SUCH HOBBESIAN ENVIRONMENTS "MASCULINITIES CONTESTS" THAT SELECT FOR THOSE EXECUTIVES WHO BEST EXEMPLIFY MASCULINE TRAITS SUCH AS A SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS ON PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS, PHYSICAL STRENGTH, AND THE WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN NO-HOLDS-BARRED COMPETITION. THIS LITERATURE TREATS THE RULE-BREAKING ENVIRONMENT THAT RESULTS AS AN INCIDENTAL BYPRODUCT OF THE WAY THAT SUCH CULTURES VALORIZE MASCULINE TRAITS. DRAWING ON INSIGHTS FROM CRIMINOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, AND FEMINIST THEORY, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY: THAT CERTAIN MANAGEMENT CULTURES INTENTIONALLY DESIGN THE COMPETITIONS TO FACILITATE BREAKING THE RULES WITH IMPUNITY. IN A HOBBESIAN WORLD, WHERE SOME PROFIT HANDSOMELY FROM DEFYING CONVENTION, ZERO-SUM COMPETITIONS PLAY A ROLE THAT EXTENDS BEYOND VALORIZING ALPHA MALES. THEY SELECT FOR LEADERS WHO WILL LIE, SHORTCHANGE THEIR FAMILIES, AND BREAK THE LAW TO GET RESULTS-AND DO SO WITHOUT EXPLICIT ORDERS THAT MIGHT SUBJECT UPPER MANAGEMENT TO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PRACTICES. IN SUCH A WORLD, WOMEN FALL BEHIND NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF MISOGYNY, THOUGH SUCH ENVIRONMENTS OFTEN BREED IT. INSTEAD, THEY LOSE BECAUSE OF A TRIPLE BIND. FIRST, WOMEN CANNOT PREVAIL IN SUCH COMPETITIONS UNLESS THEY CAN OUTMANEUVER MEN, CREDIBLY DISPLAY GREATER DEVOTION TO THE JOB, OR MORE BRAZENLY FLOUT THE LAWS. SECOND, THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISLIKED AND PUNISHED FOR DISPLAYING THE SELF-CENTERED, RULE-BREAKING BEHAVIOR OF MEN. THIRD, WOMEN BECOME LESS LIKELY TO SEEK POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY CORRECTLY PERCEIVE THAT THEY COULD NOT THRIVE AND ARE MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO DECIDE THEY DO NOT WISH TO DO SO ON SUCH TERMS, REINFORCING THE MALE-IDENTIFIED CHARACTER OF SUCH ENVIRONMENTS. WHERE THESE COMPANIES' BUSINESS MODELS DEPEND NOT JUST ON THE ABILITY TO UPEND TRADITIONAL PRACTICES, BUT TO BREAK THE LAW, THE COMPANIES CANNOT ADDRESS GENDER DISPARITIES WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE BUSINESS MODEL ITSELF. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT GENDER INEQUALITY IS INTRINSICALLY INTERTWINED WITH THE EVISCERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CORPORATE AMERICA.
276	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO FIND OUT IF THE HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES ACHIEVED BY THE CEE COUNTRIES ARE BASED EITHER ON CONSUMPTION OR ON INVESTMENTS, CONSIDERING MANY EXOGENOUS FACTORS THAT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND HOW THESE FACTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS IN THE CEE ECONOMIES TO STRESS IF THESE TRENDS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT ARE SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN. WE PERFORMED TWO PANEL LEAST SQUARES AND POOL LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATIONS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THE EXOGENOUS VARIABLES ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH (AS GDP PER CAPITA GROWTH) AND ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE SHORT AND LONG RUN, DEPENDING ON THE LAGS OF THE EXOGENOUS VARIABLES USED IN THE ANALYSIS. WE USED YEARLY DATA SERIES DURING 2004-2017 FOR EIGHT SELECTED CEE COUNTRIES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PRIVATE CONSUMPTION IS POSITIVELY RELATED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE SHORT RUN, BUT IT DOESN'T SUPPORT THE JOB CREATION PROCESS, IN THE SAME WAY AS THE SAVINGS RATE CAN'T DETERMINE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE EMPLOYMENT. PUBLIC SPENDING IS STRONGLY AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE CEE REGION, WHILE THE NET EXPORT IS WEAKLY IMPACTING ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE CEE REGION AND DOESN'T SUPPORT THE EMPLOYMENT PROCESS IN THIS AREA. THE IMPACT OF THE DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS ON THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS WEAKER IN THE CEE AREA THAN THE IMPACT OF BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SPENDING, BUT THEY ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, WHILE THE CORRELATION OF THE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS (FDIS) WITH BOTH ECONOMIC GROWTH AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS VERY WEAK, AS IT IS THE CASE OF NET EXPORTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE CEE AREA IS MAINLY BASED ON THE PRIVATE CONSUMPTION IN THE SHORT RUN BUT THE PRIVATE CONSUMPTION DOESN'T SUPPORT THE JOB CREATION PROCESS EITHER IN THE LONG RUN OR IN THE SHORT RUN. THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS BY USING GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX (CORRUPTION CONTROL, BUREAUCRACY, INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY, GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVENESS, POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW FACTORS, PROPERTY RIGHTS, MARKETS EFFICIENCY, ETC.) AND CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX ARE STRONGLY AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
277	AS PART OF THE XVI APRIL INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC CONFERENCE ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, HSE - MOSCOW, TWO SESSIONS ON ECONOMICS AND LAW WERE HELD 9 APRIL 2015. THE FIRST SESSION, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENTREPRENEURS, WAS CHAIRED BY A LEADING RESEARCHER FROM THE INSTITUTE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY IN ST. PETERSBURG KIRILL TITAEV AND THE SECOND SESSION, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF REGULATORY BODIES, WAS MODERATED BY ANDREY SHASTITKO, RESEARCHER FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR INDUSTRIAL AND MARKET STUDIES, HSE MOSCOW. SPEAKERS AT THE SESSIONS INCLUDED IRINA CHETVERIKOVA (INSTITUTE FOR THE RULE OF LAW AT THE EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY AT SAINT-PETERSBURG), L. BARDIN (CENTRAL BAR IN MOSCOW), ANTON KAZUN (HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS), ZINAIDA POGHOSOVA (HSE) AND ELENA PODKOLZINA (HSE), D. TSYTSULINA (HSE - NIZHNY NOVGOROD), SVETLANA AVDASHEVA HSE), AND SVETLANA GOLOVANOVA (HSE - NIZHNY NOVGOROD). THE DIRECTION OF THE DEBATE IN THE FIRST SESSION WAS PARTLY FORMULATED BY TITAEV, WHEN HE NOTED THAT MORE CORRECT NAME FOR FIRST SESSION WOULD BE LAW AND RATIONAL CHOICE. ACCORDING TO THE TITAEV, IN THIS CASE, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SPEAK ABOUT ECONOMIC RATIONALITY, WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS: THE ACCUSED, THE VICTIM, JUDGES AND DEFENDANTS. AT THE NEXT SESSION, THE FOCUS SHIFTED TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE FEDERAL ANTIMONOPOLY SERVICE (FAS). REAL DECISION-MAKING PRACTICES AND RISKS OF INTRODUCING CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ORGANIZATION WERE AT THE CENTER OF THE DEBATE. BOTH SESSIONS HIGHLIGHTED THE OBVIOUS CHALLENGE THAT OFTEN FORMAL RULES AND THEIR CHANGES DO NOT COMPLETELY DETERMINE THE SITUATION, BUT MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY INFORMAL NORMS. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FORMAL RULES AND INFORMAL NORMS IS A KEY ISSUE OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY. THE FOCUS OF BOTH SESSIONS WAS NOT ONLY THE FORMAL RULES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, BUT ALSO REAL-LIFE PRACTICES. SPEAKERS DESCRIBED THE LOGIC OF AWARDING JUDGMENT USING THE EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT LEGAL CASES. THEY CONCLUDED THAT ACTIONS WHICH SEEM ILLOGICAL FOR AN EXTERNAL OBSERVER (SUCH AS THE REFUSAL OF COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FAS EVIDENCE IN THEIR FAVOR) OFTEN HAVE THEIR OWN INTERNAL RATIONALITY. THEREFORE, RESEARCHERS NEED TO KNOW NOT ONLY THE LAWS, BUT ALSO THE INFORMAL NORMS. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN RECENT YEARS AND DEFINITELY WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR FUTURE STUDIES IN ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY.
278	FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING A DEEP AND PROLONGED INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. THIS HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF, FOR INSTANCE, IN THE SOVEREIGN DEBT AND EURO CRISES, THE TENSION BETWEEN NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, AND TENSIONS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. THIS MANIFOLD CRISIS HAS DWARFED THE ENORMOUS SUCCESSES OF INTEGRATION AND CONVERGENCE THAT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED OVER THE PAST SIX DECADES IN EUROPE. CRUCIALLY, THIS CRISIS HAS BLINDED MANY OBSERVERS FROM BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW AND IN WHAT FORM EUROPEAN INTEGRATION HAS MANAGED IN A SUCCESSFUL WAY TO CONNECT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF EUROPE WITH THE WHOLE OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. OUR CONTRIBUTION IS FIRSTLY AIMED AT SHOWING HOW THE EUROPEAN MECHANISM OF INTEGRATION OF DIVERSITY IN UNITY FUNCTIONS AND WHY IT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN MANY POLICY AREAS. WE PROPOSE THAT, IN ORDER TO GET OUT OF THE PRESENT DEADLOCK, THE MECHANISM THAT HAS WORKED SO WELL IN SOME POLICY AREAS SHOULD BE WIDENED TO ALL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES. EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY, WE ARGUE THAT AT ITS CORE THE CURRENT CRISIS IS A COGNITIVE PROBLEM. WE THEREFORE ARGUE THAT IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE INSTITUTIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS A POSITIVE COMMON EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE, WIDENING THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF "UNITY IN DIVERSITY" AMONG EUROPEANS, A NEW CONCEPTUAL FIGURE OR INTERPRETATIVE SCHEME IS NEEDED FOR TWO REASONS: FIRST, IN ORDER TO SEE HOW UNITY AND DIVERSITY HAS ALREADY BEEN DYNAMICALLY HARMONIZED IN A DIRECTLY RECOGNIZABLE WAY, AND SECOND, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A TOOL THAT CREATES FURTHER HARMONIZATION AND ENHANCES POPULAR LEGITIMACY FOR FURTHER EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AND CONVERGENCE. IN DOING THAT, OUR PROPOSAL BRINGS NICHOLAS OF CUSA'S (1401-1464) CONCEPT OF SPIRITUS CONEXIONIS INTO THE FOLD. HIS CONCEPT, IN OUR VIEW, REPRESENTS THE DYNAMICALLY INTEGRATIVE FIGURE NEEDED PRESENTLY IN EUROPE. AS CUSANUS LIVED IN A HISTORIC PERIOD, IN WHICH THE MEDIEVAL INTERPRETATIVE SCHEMA TO INTEGRATE DIVERSITY AND UNITY WAS NO LONGER TENABLE AND THE MODERN IDEA OF NATION STATE WAS NOT BORN YET, HE CONCEIVED A NEW PATTERN OF INTEGRATION ACCORDING TO WHICH ANY NATIONAL IDENTITY - BUT EVEN ANY CULTURE OR RELIGION - IN ORDER TO BE AWARE OF ITSELF AS A SPECIFIC ENTITY, HAS TO BE DYNAMICALLY CONNECTED WITH A SUPRANATIONAL IDENTITY THAT COMPOSES THE DIFFERENT PIECES IN AN HARMONIC WHOLE; ONLY IN LIGHT OF THIS IDENTITY THAT TRANSCENDS INDIVIDUAL IDENTITIES, IDENTITY SPECIFICITY FOR INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES CAN BE ACHIEVED.
279	THE INTENSIVE PURSUIT OF BIOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY HAS DOMINATED ANIMAL SCIENCE OVER RECENT DECADES. THIS PARADIGM IS DRIVEN LARGELY BY ECONOMIC CRITERIA FOR LOWER RESOURCE INPUT, INCREASED OUTPUT OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS, FASTER TURNOVER AND REDUCED COSTS TO THE CONSUMER. SCIENCE HAS BROKEN MANY ECONOMIC BOUNDARIES. BUT DISTURBING STABILITY ALWAYS EXACTS A PRICE: HIDDEN COSTS, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, WELFARE, BIODIVERSITY, THE RURAL POOR AND THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE SCIENTIFIC MISSION TO ENHANCE FOOD PRODUCTION IS NOW FACING NEW HORIZONS AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL FOR RADICAL CHANGE IN THE LIFE PROCESSES OF ANIMALS. THIS QUEST FOR THE GENETIC MODIFICATION OF LIVESTOCK IS UNCHARTERED TERRITORY AND WILL ALSO HAVE WIDESPREAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. TWO TYPES OF BOUNDARIES ARE CHALLENGED: ANCIENT BIOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES AND ANCIENT MAN-MADE BOUNDARIES. THE KEY BIOLOGICAL BOUNDARY IS BETWEEN SPECIES AND IS NOW VIOLATED BY GENETIC MODIFICATION: KEY MAN-MADE BOUNDARIES INCLUDE RECOGNITION OF MORAL AUTONOMY, RULE OF LAW AND THE QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMANITY AND OTHER SPECIES. ALL THESE ANCIENT BOUNDARIES ARE FOUNDATIONAL TO SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES AND HAVE BEEN TESTED OVER HUGE TIME SPANS. DISSOLUTION OF THESE BOUNDARIES NEEDS MORE CAUTION THAN CURRENTLY BEING EXERCISED. WHY? BECAUSE THE SCIENTIFIC MODELS OF THE GENOME USED FOR GENETIC MODIFICATION ARE PROVING TO BE WRONG AND INADEQUATE. EMERGING GENOME RESEARCH REVEALS THAT CONTROL OF GENE EXPRESSION IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THE MODELS USED SO FAR. FOOD PRODUCTS FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED LIVESTOCK ARE NOW IN PREPARATION FOR THE HUMAN FOOD CHAIN WITHOUT ADEQUATE TESTING AND REGULATION AND AGAINST THE EXPRESSED WISHES OF CONSUMERS. CAN THE SPECIES PRODUCED BY MILLIONS OF YEARS OF NATURAL SELECTION BE REDESIGNED SAFELY WITH INADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE? DO SCIENTISTS HAVE TO REDESIGN THE INNER MOLECULAR UNIVERSE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TOOLS? ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC ARGUMENTS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY DISSOLUTION OF ANCIENT BOUNDARIES AND STABLE GENOMES THAT HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME IN SUSTAINING LIFE? THERE MUST BE A DEEPER ANSWER IF ONLY BECAUSE WE ARE NO MORE LIKELY THAN NATURAL SELECTION TO ACHIEVE NEW ADAPTIVE STABILITY WITHOUT ENORMOUS COST. BREACHING THESE BIOLOGICAL BOUNDARIES GOES BEYOND BIOLOGY AND ECONOMICS BY OPENING THE DOOR TO TRANSHUMANISM WHICH ALREADY HAS A DARK HISTORY. GENETIC MODIFICATION OF ANIMALS PRESENTS ISSUES OF RISK, ACCOUNTABILITY, AUTHORITY, POWER, OWNERSHIP, AND MORALITY, THE NATURE OF ANIMALS AND THE MEANING AND PURPOSE OF HUMANITY - ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPLORED. SCIENTISTS ARE CALLED TO RECOGNIZE AND ACT UPON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
280	FOR THE COMMAND OF THE YUGOSLAVIAN ARMED FORCES FROM THE 1960S ONWARD, THE CONCEPT OF LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND IS USED. COMMAND IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED CONCEPT, WHILE LEADERSHIP PRESUPPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF A COLLECTIVE BODY WHICH MAKES POLITICAL DECISIONS THAT ARE CARRIED OUT BY COMMAND STRUCTURES. SINCE YUGOSLAVIA WAS NEITHER A DEMOCRATIC STATE NOR ONE THAT RESPECTED THE RULE OF LAW, THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND STRUCTURE WAS ESTABLISHED TO ORGANIZE AND PRESERVE COMMUNIST HEGEMONY IN THE STATE. SECONDLY, SINCE JOSIP BROZ TITO WAS THE LEADER OF YUGOSLAVIA FROM 1945 UNTIL 1980, THIS CREATED A PECULIARLY YUGOSLAVIAN DISTINCTION IN THAT THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND OF THE ARMED FORCES WAS IN HIS HANDS, AND NO ONE ELSE COULD INTERFERE IN THIS DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. THIS MEANT THAT AFTER HIS DEATH THE YUGOSLAVIAN ARMY COULD BECOME POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT, WHILE THE PRESIDIUM OF YUGOSLAVIA REMAINED ONLY FORMALLY THE CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED BODY WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND COMMAND OF THE YUGOSLAV ARMED FORCES. IN THE 1980S THE YUGOSLAVIAN ARMY SUCCEEDED IN FORMING A SUPREME COMMAND IN WHICH THE POST OF CHIEF OF STAFF WAS FILLED BY THE FEDERAL SECRETARY FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. ON THE BASIS OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SUPREME COMMAND WAS TO SHIFT THE POWER OF COMMAND FROM THE PRESIDIUM OF YUGOSLAVIA TO THE FEDERAL SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OR IMPEDIMENT PRESIDIUM, THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE WOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT COMMAND. THIS IS THE MANNER BY WHICH THE UNITS FUNCTIONED, FROM THE REGIMENTAL LEVEL UPWARD TO THE MILITARY DISTRICTS. IN THE LAST PHASE OF THE YUGOSLAV CRISIS AND FOLLOWING THE DIVISION OF THE PRESIDIUM INTO TWO PARTS WHICH COULD NO LONGER FUNCTION AS A WHOLE, THE YUGOSLAV ARMY THROUGH THE SUPREME COMMAND BEGAN TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY. UNTIL OCTOBER 1991, THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE WAS THE REAL, IF UNLAWFUL, SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE YUGOSLAVIAN ARMY. AT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER, WHEN THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDIUM OF YUGOSLAVIA CONSISTED ONLY OF SERBIA WITH ITS REGIONS AND MONTENEGRO, THE PRESIDIUM BEGAN TO FUNCTION AGAIN, THOUGH THE OTHER REPUBLICS AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ITS LEGITIMACY. FROM THEN ONWARD THE YUGOSLAV ARMY BECAME DE FACTO THE ARMED FORCE OF SERBIA AND THE SERBS IN THE REMAINDER OF YUGOSLAVIA, WHICH IN MAY 1992 IT BECAME DE JURE.
281	THE "BENJAKHAN" PRINCIPLE IS AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN BUDDHISM THAT CAN BE USED TO CORRECT THOUGHTS, MINDS AND BEHAVIORS FOR PRISONERS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS, THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC WORK OF ALL BEINGS AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. THEREFORE, THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTOR IN KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING ONESELF FROM THE ELEMENTS OF FORM, FEELING, CONTRACT, SANKHARA, AND SPIRIT ACCORDING TO BUDDHIST PRINCIPLES WILL ENABLE PRISONERS TO SEE THEMSELVES AS THEY REALLY ARE, TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND HUMAN SYSTEMS AND MECHANISMS AS THEY REALLY ARE. EVERY ACTION OF A HUMAN BEING HAS A STARTING POINT WITH A "THINKING" THEREFORE, THE DECISION TO COMMIT A CRIME IS A RESULT OF THE THOUGHT SYSTEM AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERSON. ACTIONS BENEFIT AND SATISFY ONE'S OWN NEEDS AND CONSIDER ONE'S CHANCE TO ESCAPE FROM THE LAW AND STATE MECHANISMS, ESCAPED FROM ARREST AND PROSECUTION OF THE STATE. HIS THOUGHTS LEAD TO DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. THIS IS AN IDEA THAT LACKS INTELLECT IN A POSITIVE WAY (POSITIVE THINKING) IT WILL BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE THINKING, MIND, ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIORTO REJECT THE IDEA OF COMMITTING A CRIME WHICH MAKES HIM A PERSON WHO IS A GOOD CITIZEN OF SOCIETY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW ONCE AGAIN, ABLE TO MANAGE AND CORRECT THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE SUITABLE FOR THEMSELVES. FROM THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, JAPAN AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIESHAVE PRACTICED OF "MINDFULNESS" THAT WAS USED ON THE PRISONERS TO CONCENTRATE. THIS OPENS THE MENTAL DOOR FOR THE PRISONER TO REVIEW HIMSELF, CONSIDER HIMSELF, ADJUSTING HIS THOUGHTS, MIND, AND BEHAVIOR, WHICH LEADS TO ADJUSTMENTSINSIDE THE BENJAKHAN SYSTEM OF THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES. IT IS AN ACTIVITY OF THE PREPARATION BEFORE THE RELEASE OF PRISONERS FOR "RETURNING GOOD PEOPLE TO SOCIETY" WITH DHARMA PRINCIPLES IN BUDDHISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE THAT "NOBODY CAN CHANGE ANYONE EXCEPT THE PERSON WHO WANTS TO CHANGE HIMSELF'. BASED ON SUCH FACTS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT BUDDHIST PRINCIPLES, ESPECIALLY THE "BENJAKHAN" PRINCIPLE, BE APPLIED TO CORRECT THINKING AND BEHAVIOR OF PRISONERSBY CREATING A LEARNING PROCESS IN VARIOUS FORMS AND METHODS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF REHABILITATION OF PRISONERS, THE "PRISONER" HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRISONER HIMSELF. THIS WILL ENABLE IT TO ACHIEVE THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRISONER GOALS.
282	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE VALUE COMPONENT OF JAPAN'S APPROACH TO EAST ASIAN REGIONALISM IN THE PERIOD OF SHINZO ABE'S CABINETS. AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR, JAPAN HAS TAKEN SEVERAL INSTITUTION-BUILDING INITIATIVES IN THE SPHERE OF MULTILATERAL REGIONAL COOPERATION IN EAST ASIA, INCLUDING ASEAN PLUS SIX, EAST ASIAN SUMMIT, TPPCP, ETC. ALL THESE INSTITUTIONS HAD DIFFERENT UNDERPINNING IN TERMS OF THEIR ORIGIN, STRUCTURE, MEMBERSHIP OR FUNCTIONAL MISSION. YET, A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF JAPAN'S APPROACH TO EAST ASIAN REGIONALISM LIES IN ITS "VALUE ORIENTATION". ABE BECAME THE FIRST JAPANESE LEADER AFTER KOIZUMI TO WIDELY USE THE RHETORIC OF "DEMOCRATIC VALUES" FOR SUBSTANTIATING JAPAN'S FORMULA OF INSTITUTIONAL UP-BUILDING IN EAST ASIA. JAPAN'S VISION OF "OPEN REGIONALISM" IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, MUTUAL TRUST, TRANSPARENCY AND INCLUSIVENESS. A SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS PUT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE, WHICH IN THE EYES OF TOKYO SHOULD BE INDISPENSABLE FOR COMBATING NON-TRADITIONAL THREATS, PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, EXPANDING COOPERATION TO DIFFERENT AREAS SUCH AS HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, FINANCE, ETC. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SUCH COOPERATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE SPILLOVER EFFECT. THE VALUE-BASED APPROACH ADOPTED BY JAPAN IN REALITY WAS INTENDED TO "DILUTE" CHINA'S INFLUENCE IN THE MULTILATERAL REGIONAL STRUCTURES THROUGH THE ADMISSION OF NEW "LIKE-MINDED" MEMBERS, SUCH AS INDIA, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, WHICH SHARED LIBERAL ECONOMIC VALUES AND WERE FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW (LIKE JAPAN). THE JAPANESE VISION OF REGIONALISM, FROM THE VALUE POINT, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COHERENT DOCTRINE, BECAUSE OF THE MUTUAL INCOMPATIBILITY OF DIFFERENT VALUES ACCENTUATED IN TOKYO'S RHETORIC. FOR EXAMPLE, ABE'S PHRASEOLOGY COMBINES "UNIVERSAL" AND "ASIAN" VALUES, OPEN AND CLOSED REGIONALISM, FUTURE-ORIENTED APPROACH TO REGIONAL RELATIONS, THE DESIRE "TO DRAW A LINE" UNDER JAPAN'S POST-WAR PAST, ETC. YET, SKILLFUL COMBINATION OF THESE SLOGANS IN ABE'S RHETORIC GIVES HIM AN ADDITIONAL DIPLOMATIC LEVERAGE AGAINST CHINA, AS MANY OF JAPAN'S ASIAN NEIGHBORS ARE WARY OF THE PHENOMENON OF "CHINA RISE". WHILE REMAINING ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE BARRICADES WITH THE UNITED STATES IN THE PARADIGM OF THE "NEW BIPOLARITY IN ASIA", JAPAN RELISHES A FREEDOM OF MANEUVER FOR PUTTING FORWARD VARIOUS POLITICAL INITIATIVES IN EAST ASIA AND EVEN PROVIDING A COUNTERWEIGHT TO WASHINGTON.
283	ENSURING SUSTAINABLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA IS LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNANCE BASED ON LAW. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT EASY TO DETECT AND ENSURE DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT, DESPITE THE NOMINATION OF STRATEGIC GOALS, THERE ARE DEVIATIONS IN THE LEGAL SPHERE FROM THE ESTABLISHED GOALS AND PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL REGULATION. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON THE GENERALIZATION OF THE MATERIALS OF PUBLIC AND ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS, THE AUTHOR'S EXPERIENCE OF MANY YEARS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE PREPARATION OF DRAFT LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL ACTS AND THE STUDY OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. THE DATA OF SOCIAL RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC MATERIALS ON THIS TOPIC WERE USED. DURING THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL REGULATORS, THROUGH WHICH THE STRATEGIC AND NATIONAL GOALS OF THE COUNTRY AND INDIVIDUAL AREAS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE ESTABLISHED. CHANGES OFT EN OCCUR WITHOUT DEEP JUSTIFICATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A MANAGEMENT MECHANISM, AND AS A RESULT, THE SUBJECTS OF MANAGEMENT SEEM TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE OBJECTS OF INFLUENCE AND ACT IN THEIR OWN "MANAGEMENT CIRCLE". AN IMPORTANT VECTOR OF DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT IS THE ACTIVE USE OF THE HUMAN FACTOR AND THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE AFFAIRS. IN THE MEANTIME, THE PASSIVITY OF PEOPLE AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR SOCIAL AND LEGAL ROLES, WHICH ARE ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, ARE OBSERVED. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS MAY BE LEFT WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF CITIZENS. MEANWHILE, THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW AND LEGAL PSYCHOLOGY CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASE IN THE "ZONE" OF LAWFUL BEHAVIOR AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGAL DECISIONS AND ACTIONS. IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEHAVIOR OF CITIZENS. THE BEHAVIOURAL MECHANISM OF GOVERNANCE AND LAW IS CHANGING DUE TO AN INCREASING SHARE OF NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. DIGITALIZATION AFFECTS THE COMPETENCE OF THE AUTHORITIES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISIONS, THE STYLE OF MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, THE OVERALL REGULATORY SPACE. ROBOTICS PROGRAMS EXPAND THE POSSIBILITIES OF NARROWING ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, INCREASE THE VOLUME OF FORECASTING AND ANALYTICAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. IT REQUIRES A CONSISTENT SOLUTION OF LEGAL, ORGANIZATIONAL AND OTHER TASKS. THE MAIN THING IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT TO ACHIEVE THE STRATEGIC GOALS OF THE COUNTRY.
284	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE ISSUES OF IMPROVING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. ACTUAL PROBLEMS OF IMPROVING FEDERAL LEGISLATION ARE IDENTIFIED. THE LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION WAS PREPARED IN RESPONSE TO VLADIMIR PUTIN'S ADDRESS TO THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF JANUARY 15, 2020. THE LAW WAS TO FIX THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IS A SINGLE FEDERAL CENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF BODIES THAT MONITOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS, COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR POWERS, AND PERFORM OTHER FUNCTIONS. A SYSTEMATIC LEGAL REGULATION OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE REQUIRES CONSISTENCY OF ALL THE RULES GOVERNING SPECIFIC PUBLIC RELATIONS, AS WELL AS COMPLIANCE WITH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, THE ACTUAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE DEFINED IN THE LAWS. THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE LAW ON THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE PRISM OF STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND IMPROVING THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AS WELL AS LEGALLY PROTECTED INTERESTS OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION CREATES LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, WHICH MUST BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF IMPROVING SECTOR LAWS. THIS AMENDMENT IS ABOUT GIVING THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA THE RIGHT TO APPOINT AND DISMISS NOT ONLY REGIONAL PROSECUTORS, BUT ALSO OTHER PROSECUTORS, EXCEPT FOR CITY, DISTRICT AND EQUIVALENT PROSECUTORS. THE CATEGORY "OTHER PROSECUTORS" REQUIRES ITS OWN INTERPRETATION. THE FACT IS THAT "OTHER PROSECUTORS" CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS SPECIAL PROSECUTORS WHO MAY BE OUTSIDE THE GENERAL SYSTEM OF PROSECUTORIAL BODIES: THEY MAY BE APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT TO INVESTIGATE ACTS OF SENIOR OFFICIALS OR HEADS OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE ITSELF, OR THEY MAY DEAL WITH PARTICULARLY COMPLEX FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRIMES, I.E. THE COMPETENCE OF THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS DETERMINED BY THE PRESIDENT OR THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL. THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE ENTIRE STATE SYSTEM AT THE PRESENT HISTORICAL STAGE OF ITS DEVELOPMENT DEPENDS ON THE CORRECT SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE FEATURES OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AS A WHOLE.
285	FOR THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES MODERNIZATION OF ANY KIND IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE POLITICAL AGENDA. POLICY-MAKERS AND EXPERTS ARE CHALLENGED TO ELUCIDATE ITS DISTINCT PATHS IN DIFFERENT ECONOMIES, TO SHOW WHY SOME COUNTRIES SUCCEED AND OTHERS FAIL ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS MODERNIZATION, AND TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS THAT MAKE SUCCESS STORIES. IN THIS CASE, CLOSE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE LINKAGES BETWEEN MODERNIZATION AND VALUE SYSTEMS, IN PARTICULAR, TO TOLERANCE. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO TEST EMPIRICALLY THE ASSUMPTION THAT TOLERANCE EXERTS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON MODERNIZATION (WHICH IS UNDERSTOOD IN ITS 'NARROW' SENSE AS ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT) AS WELL AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF AN ENABLING MECHANISM - POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS OF OUR STUDY ARE THE CULTURAL MODERNIZATION APPROACH BY RONALD INGLEHART AND THE CONCEPT OF THE "CREATIVE CLASS" BY RICHARD FLORIDA. WE USED DATA FROM 58 COUNTRIES OVER 1996-2008, RETRIEVED FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY, AS WELL AS FROM THE WORLD BANK DATABASES "WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS" AND "WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS". THE ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT TOLERANCE DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MODERNIZATION IN TERMS OF TRANSITION TOWARDS A POST-INDUSTRIAL (INNOVATION) ECONOMY. THIS PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMERGENCE OF A SPECIFIC SOCIAL CLASS - A CREATIVE LASS. TOLERANCE, EXPRESSED AS A TOLERANT ATTITUDE TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALITY, GENDER EQUALITY, AND A DECREASE IN XENOPHOBIA, IS A CRUCIAL PREREQUISITE IN ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR ATTRACTING CREATIVE PEOPLE. TWO DISTINCT PATTERNS OF MODERNIZATION ARE REVEALED, DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL TOLERANCE: A TOLERANT MODEL AND A CATCH-UP MODEL. THE POST-INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY REQUIRES THE FORMATION OF A RELEVANT SOCIETY BASED ON THE VALUES OF SELF-EXPRESSION. HOWEVER, SOME COUNTRIES TRY TO BUILD A POST-INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY WITHOUT BUILDING A POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY, ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN THIS CASE IS RATHER LOW. THIS CATCH-UP MODEL FOCUSES ON INVESTMENT, A LOWER-LEVEL OF TOLERANCE, AND WEAK POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. THE LATTER MATTER ESPECIALLY, AND THEY SEEM TO BE THE CAUSAL MECHANISM TO ENSURE THE LINKAGES BETWEEN TOLERANCE AND SUCCESSFUL MODERNIZATION. FIRST OF ALL, THE LINKAGE EMERGES FROM THE RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. INSTITUTIONS ARE REGARDED AS A KEY ELEMENT IN THE TOLERANT MODEL OF MODERNIZATION, ENSURING CREATIVE PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN OPENNESS, DIVERSITY, AND PROTECTION OF THEIR INTERESTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO IDENTITY. CATCH-UP STRATEGY, IN CONTRAST, PUTS THE MAIN EMPHASIS NOT ON VALUES AND STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONS, BUT ON HIGHER INVESTMENT RATES.
286	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL TORTURE AS IT IS REPRESENTED IN THE "COURT CASE STORIES" (GONGAN XIAOSHUO, (SIC)) COLLECTED IN THE THREE MAJOR ANTHOLOGIES OF VERNACULAR STORIES EDITED BY FENG MENGLONG ((SIC), 1574-1646) OF THE MING DYNASTY. IN A LITERARY FORM WITH SUCH A BROAD APPEAL, ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND TORTURE REPRESENTED AS A SPECTACLE AND AS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING THE CONCEALED NARRATIVES OF CRIME CONTAINED WITH HUMAN SUBJECTS WHO ARE MADE THE OBJECTS OF TORTURE. INSTEAD, ONE FINDS JUDICIAL TORTURE REPRESENTED IN ROUTINE, ALMOST MUNDANE, TERMS AS A PRACTICE THAT OFTEN FAILS TO EXTRACT THE TRUTH AND EVEN AT TIMES OBSCURES IT. THE MAGISTRATE WHO USES JUDICIAL TORTURE IN HIS COURT CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE EXCELLENT, WHO IS SO WISE THAT HE DOES NOT NEED TO USE IT; (2) THE COMPETENT, WHO USES TORTURE DURING INTERROGATION ONLY ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW WHEN HE FEELS THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED HAS ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED THROUGH EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY; (3) THE IGNORANT, WHO USES TORTURE TOO READILY BEFORE COLLECTING SUFFICIENT CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY AND OFTEN EXTRACTS FALSE CONFESSIONS; AND (4) THE EVIL, WHO IS FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE INNOCENCE OF HIS VICTIM BUT USES TORTURE DURING INTERROGATION OUT OF PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS OF AVARICE OR REVENGE. THE TRUE SPECTACLE THAT THESE NARRATIVES DEPICT IS THE COSMIC FORCE OF BOO ((SIC)), OR "RETRIBUTION," AT WORK. TORTURE IN THESE STORIES IS DEPICTED AS A MEANS TO ALLOW THREE TYPES OF NARRATIVES TO UNFOLD, INTERSECT AND REACH THEIR APPROPRIATE MOMENTS OF CLOSURE: (1) THE NARRATIVE OF THE ORIGINAL CRIME, (2) THE NARRATIVE OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVESTIGATING THE CRIME, AND (3) THE NARRATIVE OF COSMIC RETRIBUTION, WHICH SHOWS THAT EVILDOERS ARE PUNISHED IN THE END, OFTEN AFTER LONG DELAYS AND LEGAL COMPLICATIONS. THE PRACTICE OF TORTURE STANDS AT THE INTERSECTION OF THESE NARRATIVES FOR IT IS EMPLOYED OR THREATENED BY MAGISTRATES TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE NARRATIVE OF THE CRIME, SO THAT IT CAN BE SUBSUMED BY AND BRING CLOSURE TO THE LEGAL NARRATIVE, THUS ALLOWING THE DEMANDS OF THE COSMIC NARRATIVE OF RETRIBUTION TO BE SATISFIED. THE AESTHETIC OF VERNACULAR STORIES DICTATES THAT THE LEGAL NARRATIVE AND THE NARRATIVE OF RETRIBUTION MUST BE BROUGHT INTO ALIGNMENT BY THE END OF THE STORY, ALTHOUGH MANY YEARS MAY PASS BEFORE THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED.
287	THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO CLARIFY THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF LONG-TERM PRESERVATION IN HETMANSHCHYNA OF THE 18TH CENTURY, SUCH A SOCIAL INSTITUTION AS UNMARRIED (CIVIL) MARRIAGES AMONG THE ORTHODOX POPULATION, TO SHOW THE STRUGGLE OF THE SECULAR AUTHORITIES AND THE CLERGY AGAINST UNMARRIED MARRIAGES, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE SIGNS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MONOPOLY OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN THE MARITAL AND FAMILY SPHERE OF SOCIETY. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF PRE-DEVELOPMENT IS TO FORM THE PRINCIPLE OF HISTORY, OBJECTIVITY, SYSTEMATIC, ANTHROPOLOGY AND INTER-DISCIPLINARILY. APPARENTLY BEFORE THEM, THE HOMELAND WAS SEEN AS A MUTUALLY DEGRADED SOCIO-CULTURAL PHENOMENON, AS A RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL NORMS OF THE UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX POPULATION OF THE FIRST TIME WAS REGULATED. THERE ARE THREE GROUPS OF METHODS USED BY THE PRESENTERS: SPECIAL-SCIENCE AND SPECIFIC-PROBLEM. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIVE-BORN FAMILIES, METHODS OF SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY, HISTORY OF LIFE, LOCAL SOCIAL HISTORY, HISTORICAL DEMOGRAPHY, QUANTITATIVE METHODS WITH THE METHOD OF VISUALIZATION HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED. SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE ARTICLE PROVES THAT THE ORTHODOX CHURCH HAS BEEN FORCED TO TOLERATE AND RECOGNIZE UNMARRIED MARRIAGES, WHICH HAVE BECOME WIDESPREAD, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE COMMON PEOPLE. THE LATTER WERE A REMNANT OF CUSTOMARY PEOPLE'S LAW. HOWEVER, IN THE 18TH CENTURY, AFTER THE MARITAL RELATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATION, UNMARRIED MARRIAGES GRADUALLY DIED OUT. HOWEVER, IN REAL LIFE THEY CONTINUED TO EXIST BECAUSE THEY WERE CAUSED BY OBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, MENTIONS OF THEM IN OFFICIAL SOURCES ARE ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. IN PRACTICE, SUCH MARRIAGES WERE DETECTED ONLY WHEN THE CASE WENT TO COURT. THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT THE CHURCH, NOT RECOGNIZING THEM, FOUGHT AGAINST THEM, AND WHERE IT WAS POWERLESS, SIMPLY TRIED NOT TO NOTICE. PRIESTS COMMITTED NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY CANONS: THEY HID CIVIL (UNMARRIED) MARRIAGES, MARRIED BRIDES ON FORBIDDEN DAYS (FASTING) AND HOURS (AT NIGHT), IN UNAUTHORIZED PLACES (CHAPELS, AT HOME). THEREFORE, THE ORTHODOX CHURCH FIRST HAD TO FORCE THE CLERGY TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES PROPERLY. THIS WAS DONE THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF PENALTIES, FINES, DEPRIVATION OF DIGNITY, DISCIPLINARY ACTION (TEMPORARY BAN ON SERVICES). EVENTUALLY, APPLYING VARIOUS MEANS OF ORTHODOX EDUCATION TO THE LAITY, WHICH COVERED ALL AGE GROUPS OF PARISHIONERS, GRADUALLY FORMED THE NEED TO OBSERVE THE NORMS OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS.
288	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE DEGREE OF PERMISSIBLE INTERFERENCE WITH A JUDGE'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSING HIS/HER OWN OPINION AND CONVICTIONS. A QUESTION IS RAISED ABOUT THE LIMITS OF A JUDGE'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND DISCRETION OF THE STATE IN ESTABLISHING HIS/HER COMMUNICATIVE BEHAVIOUR, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (HEREINAFTER ECTHR, THE COURT). UNDERSTANDING THESE LIMITS IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUAL JUDGES BUT ALSO FOR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE, AS RESTRICTIONS ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION MAY AFFECT THE STATE'S PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE KEY DOCUMENTS THAT REGULATE THE ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF A JUDGE IN UKRAINE ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY SEVERAL SPHERES OF IMPERATIVE REGULATION OF A JUDGE'S BEHAVIOUR IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTIVITY: DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE (IN COURT PROCEDURE); IN PUBLIC SPEECHES, PARTICULARLY IN THE MEDIA; DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OTHER ACTIVITIES NOT PROHIBITED FOR THE JUDGE - LITERARY, SCIENTIFIC, EDUCATIONAL; DURING INTERNET COMMUNICATION; IN EVERYDAY LIFE. ECTHR CASE-LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF ASSESSING THE LIMITS OF A JUDGE'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSING ONE'S OPINION DEVELOPS IN TWO DIRECTIONS. IN THE FIRST, THE JUDGE'S FREEDOM IS CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF ART. 10 (FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND ASSOCIATION) OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (HEREINAFTER ECHR, THE CONVENTION). IN THE SECOND, THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS LIMITED TO THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL OF OTHERS (IN THE CONTEXT OF IMPARTIALITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF A COURT WITHIN THE MEANING OF ART. 6 OF THE ECHR). IN GENERAL, THE MATTER OF JUDICIAL EVALUATION WAS THE STATEMENTS OF JUDGES CONCERNING CASES THAT WERE IN THEIR PROCEEDINGS; THOSE CRITICISING JUDICIAL REFORM MEASURES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS; THOSE WHICH CRITICISED THEIR COLLEAGUES. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS ALLOW US TO CONCLUDE THAT, DESPITE THE DIFFERENT PRECONDITIONS, DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, AND VARYING IMPLEMENTATION REFLECTIONS, THE FREEDOM OF A JUDGE TO EXPRESS HIS/ HER OPINION IS LIMITED BY HIS/HER SPECIAL STATUS AS A STATE SERVANT (IN A BROAD SENSE). WHERE THE BOUNDARY IS IN A PARTICULAR CASE SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES MUST DEVELOP THEIR OWN CRITERIA FOR ASSESSING THE BALANCE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INTERESTS IN A JUDGE'S COMMUNICATIVE BEHAVIOUR.
289	THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT ("FISC") HAS AN ARTICLE III PROBLEM. UNDER SECTION 702 OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 1978 AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 ("FAA"), WHICH BROUGHT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, THE FISC TYPICALLY PROCEEDS EX PARTE, HEARING ONLY FROM ONE PARTY: THE GOVERNMENT. FISC PROCEEDINGS UNDER SECTION 702 THEREFORE LACK THE BENEFIT OF ADVERSE PARTIES CLARIFYING THE ISSUES, WHICH THE SUPREME COURT HAS LINKED WITH SOUND ADJUDICATION AND JUDICIAL SELF-GOVERNANCE. THE FISC'S SECTION 702 ROLE DOES NOT FIT NEATLY INTO THE ESTABLISHED CATEGORIES OF CASES, SUCH AS SEARCH WARRANTS, WHERE EX PARTE PROCEEDINGS ARE PERMISSIBLE. THE BROAD SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES THAT THE FISC REVIEWS UNDER SECTION 702 LACK THE INDIVIDUALIZED FACTS OF WARRANT REQUESTS OR A DIRECT LINK TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. UNDER ARTICLE III OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, THE FISC'S SECTION 702 ROLE MAY BE NEITHER FISH NOR FOWL. CLOSER EXAMINATION REVEALS THAT ALTHOUGH THE FISC'S ROLE UNDER SECTION 702 IS NOVEL, IT FITS WITHIN ARTICLE III'S SPACE FOR THE EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT BY INDEPENDENT COURTS. THIS ARTICLE MAKES THAT CASE VIA THE CONGRUENCY TEST, WHICH THE SUPREME COURT INVOKED IN MORRISON V. OLSON TO UPHOLD A STATUTE REQUIRING JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF EXECUTIVE MISCONDUCT IN THE WAKE OF THE WATERGATE SCANDAL. BUILDING ON MORRISON, IT ARGUES THAT THE TEST FOR COMPLIANCE OF STATUTES WITH ARTICLE III MUST BE PRAGMATIC, AFFORDING CONGRESS A MEASURE OF FLEXIBILITY. TWO ARTICLE III CASES FROM OCTOBER TERM 2015 BANK MARKAZI V. PETERSON AND SPOKEO, INC. V. ROBINS DEMONSTRATE THAT CONGRESS IS ENTITLED TO DEFERENCE WHEN IT SEEKS TO PROMOTE OPERATIONAL VALUES SUCH AS SPEED AND ACCURACY IN. DYNAMIC DOMAINS SUCH AS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN RELATIONS, AND EMERGENT TECHNOLOGY. THE IMPORTANCE OF TIMELY RESPONSES TO CYBER THREATS FITS THE FAA WITHIN THAT RUBRIC. THE FISC'S SECTION 702 ROLE ALSO SERVES IMPORTANT STRUCTURAL VALUES, BY DETERRING EXECUTIVE BRANCH SURVEILLANCE ABUSES. MOREOVER, IN THE USA FREEDOM ACT, PASSED AFTER EDWARD SNOWDEN'S DISCLOSURES ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY SURVEILLANCE, CONGRESS ESTABLISHED A PANEL OF AMICI CURIAE TO ASSIST THE FISC. ROBUST ARGUMENTS BY AMICI CURIAE, POSSIBLY AUGMENTED BY A PUBLIC ADVOCATE OPPOSING GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS, CAN REPLICATE MOST OF THE VIRTUES OF ADVERSARIAL COMBAT. COMBINING THE VIRTUES OF ADVERSARIAL ARGUMENT WITH THE OPERATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BENEFITS OF THE FAA DEMONSTRATES THE STATUTE'S CONGRUENCE WITH THE HISTORY AND PRACTICE OF FEDERAL COURTS.
290	THE PROPOSAL TO BAN MINARETS IS CONTROVERSIAL BY ITS VERY NATURE. ON THE ONE HAND SWISS CITIZENS ARE SOVEREIGN AND ACT AS THE ULTIMATE SUPREME AUTHORITY. BY THEIR WILL THEY MAY SEEK VIA POPULAR INITIATIVE TO ENACT, REVOKE OR ALTER SUCH, AND ANY, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AS THEY SEE FIT. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SO-CALLED MATERIAL BARS TO SWISS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS-SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS-ARISING FROM THE PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. NOT SURPRISINGLY, THESE MATERIAL BARS TO ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY ARE FIERCELY CONTESTED BECAUSE THEY MEAN EITHER GREATER OR LESSER POWERS TO THE CITIZEN AND, INDIRECTLY, TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES. THE POPULAR INITIATIVE TO BAN MINARETS RAISES NOT ONLY QUESTIONS IN RESPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHALLENGE THE LEGAL ARCHITECTURE OF SWITZERLAND. THE INITIATIVE MAY BE HELD INVALID BY THE SWISS GENERAL ASSEMBLY (HENCEFORTH 'GENERAL ASSEMBLY' OR 'ASSEMBLY') ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT BREACHES THE PEREMPTORY NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IF THIS PROVES TO BE THE CASE, THE SWISS PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON IT. ARGUABLY, SUCH INTERFERENCE IS FEASIBLE ONLY IF THE MATERIAL BAR TO INITIATIVES IS WIDENED BEYOND ITS ORIGINALLY ACCEPTED SCOPE. APPARENTLY, THE POWERS OF THE SWISS SOVEREIGN BECAME THEREBY UNEQUIVOCALLY CURBED. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SWISS DOMESTIC LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IS PIVOTAL ALSO SHOULD THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY DECLARE THE INITIATIVE TO BE VALID. THE PEOPLE WOULD AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ASSEMBLY'S DECISION POSSESS THE RIGHT TO VOTE EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE INITIATIVE. BUT REGARDLESS OF THE POPLAR VOTE'S OUTCOME, THE SECOND OPTION PRIMA FACIE IMPLIES THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE SWISS CITIZENS HAS BEEN UPHELD, AND CONCESSIONS NEED ONLY TO BE MADE BY THOSE WHO ARE EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE PROPOSED BAN. YET IN ITS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT THE MATTER IS MORE COMPLEX AND MORE FAR-REACHING THAN THAT. THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER CONCENTRATES ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS ADVISABLE FOR THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO COMPROMISE THE PEOPLE'S SOVEREIGNTY BY WIDENING THE ORIGINAL SCOPE OF PEREMPTORY NORMS. THE SECOND PART EXPLORES WHAT A POPULAR VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THE BAN ON MINARETS COULD MEAN IN LAW. IN ORDER TO RAISE THE AWARENESS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER BEYOND ITS LEGAL DIMENSION, THE INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSION OF THIS PAPER WILL SHED SPECIFIC LIGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW AS A PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINE.
291	POLAND WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY IN EUROPE TO ADOPT A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION (OF 3RD MAY 1791). SUBSEQUENT CONSTITUTIONS WERE ADOPTED AFTER THE RESTORATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH TOOK PLACE IN 1918. THESE WERE THE MARCH CONSTITUTION OF 1921 AND APRIL CONSTITUTION OF 1935. BOTH ACTS VARIED CONSIDERABLY. AFTER WORLD WAR II POLAND LOST ITS CAPACITY TO SHAPE ITS SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN AN INDEPENDENT WAY. THIS WAS MANIFESTED IN THE ADOPTION, IN 1952, OF THE CONSTITUTION OF POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC, MODELLED ON THE 1936 SOVIET CONSTITUTION (ALSO KNOWN AS THE STALIN CONSTITUTION). SINCE 1989, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN POLAND. THE CURRENT CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND WAS ADOPTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON 2 APRIL 1997. A NATIONWIDE REFERENDUM ON ITS APPROVAL WAS HELD ON 25 MAY AND ITS CAME INTO FORCE ON 17 OCTOBER 1997. POLAND'S CONSTITUTION IS COMPOSED OF 13 CHAPTERS PRECEDED BY A PREAMBLE. THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF: A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, THE COMMON GOOD, SUBSIDIARITY, DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, SOVEREIGNTY OF THE NATION, SEPARATION OF AND BALANCE BETWEEN POWERS, POLITICAL PLURALISM, RECOGNITION OF INHERENT DIGNITY OF THE PERSON AS A SOURCE OF HIS/HER FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS, AND FREEDOM OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. SOME OF THESE PRINCIPLES, ROOTED IN CLASSICAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. THE PRINCIPLE OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT. IN THE 10-YEAR PERIOD OF BEING IN FORCE, THE CONSTITUTION PROVED ITSELF AS AN ACT DIFFICULT TO BE AMENDED. ACCORDING TO LEGAL SCIENCE, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A " FIXED" CONSTITUTION, WHICH MEANS THE PROCEDURES FOR ITS AMENDMENT CONTAIN VARIOUS TYPES OF THRESHOLDS (E. G. THE REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING MAJORITY OF VOTES) THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO MEET. EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE BARRIERS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT, UNTIL NOW, THE CONSTITUTION WAS AMENDED ONLY ONCE (ON 8 OCTOBER 2006) TO INCLUDE THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW). AS OF 17 MAY 2007, THERE WERE FIVE BILLS TO AMEND POLAND'S CONSTITUTION SUBMITTED TO THE SEJM. ONE OF THOSE BILLS RELATED TO ASSISTANT JUDGES ADJUDICATING IN DISTRICT COURTS, ANOTHER TWO BILLS RELATED TO FORMAL IMMUNITY OF THE DEPUTY TO THE SEJM, AND NEXT TWO PROPOSED IMPLEMENTING A PROHIBITION ON THE ELECTION TO THE SEJM OF PERSONS CONVICTED FOR CERTAIN INTENTIONAL OFFENCES.
292	CANADA DISTINGUISHES "ORDINARY CRIME" FROM TERRORISM OFFENCES PRIMARILY BY REFERENCE TO WHETHER AN ACT MEETS THE CRIMINAL CODE'S DEFINITION OF "TERRORIST ACTIVITY." THE MOST CONFUSING AND LEAST UNDERSTOOD ELEMENT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IS ITS MOTIVE REQUIREMENT, THAT BEING THAT FOR A CRIME TO CONSTITUTE A TERRORISM OFFENCE, THE ACTOR MUST BE MOTIVATED BY POLITICS, RELIGION, OR IDEOLOGY. HOW DO WE KNOW WHEN SUCH A MOTIVE EXISTS, OR EVEN HOW TO DEFINE THESE MOTIVATIONS? HOW DO WE DIFFERENTIATE ORDINARY CRIME FROM TERRORISM IF WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IDEOLOGIES OR RELIGIONS "COUNT" AND WHICH DO NOT? DO FAR-RIGHT MOTIVATIONS PICKED AND CHOSEN FROM NUMEROUS GROUPS COUNT? HOW ABOUT SOMEONE THAT IS MOTIVATED TO ACT VIOLENTLY BY A BELIEF IN QANON, OR BECAUSE OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO A POLITICAL PROTEST MOVEMENT? IN THIS ARTICLE WE EXPLAIN WHY THE MOTIVE REQUIREMENT IS SO IN NEED OF REFINEMENT AND SHED LIGHT ON WHAT DIFFERENTIATES ORDINARY CRIME FROM TERRORISM. TO DO SO, WE OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY BEHIND CANADA'S ANTI-TERRORISM CRIMINAL REGIME AS WELL AS EVERY TERRORISM JUDGMENT, SENTENCING DECISION, AND JURY INSTRUCTION ISSUED BETWEEN 2001-2021. WE FIND THAT NEITHER PARLIAMENT NOR THE COURTS HAVE DEFINED THE MOTIVE REQUIREMENT, LEAVING OTHERS TO DEFINE TERRORISM AS SOMETHING CLOSER TO "WE KNOW IT WHEN WE SEE IT." WE THUS LOOK MORE BROADLY, INCLUDING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE REALM OF CRIMINAL LAW, FOR WORKABLE LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF POLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, AND IDEOLOGICAL; WE ENGAGE IN A PROCESS OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION TO NARROW THE DEFINITIONS; AND, FINALLY, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MOST COMPLEX AND VEXING MOTIVE-THAT BEING IDEOLOGY-WE LOOK OUTSIDE THE LAW ENTIRELY TO TERRORISM STUDIES, SOCIOLOGY, RELIGIOUS STUDIES, AND ELSEWHERE. DRAWING ON THESE VARIED SOURCES, WE OFFER A DEFINITION FOR THE MOTIVE REQUIREMENT THAT IS PRACTICAL FOR THE COURTROOM WHILE SERVING TO BOTH RESTRICT THE APPLICATION OF CANADA'S ANTI-TERRORISM REGIME BEYOND ITS CURRENT INCARNATION AND ALSO ENSURE THAT EMERGENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY IS ADEQUATELY CAPTURED. SUCH CLARITY IS VITAL TO THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE THE MOTIVE REQUIREMENT IS AN ELEMENT OF TERRORISM OFFENCES AND, AS SUCH, MUST BE PROVED BY THE CROWN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT; BUT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT INVESTIGATIONS, CHARGES, AND PROSECUTIONS ARE BASED ON CONCISE UNDERSTANDINGS OF "TERRORIST ACTIVITY" AND NOT IMPLICIT UNDERSTANDINGS THAT TEND TO MARGINALIZE SOME (USUALLY MINORITY) GROUPS WHILE ALLOWING OTHERS MORE PERMISSIVE ROOM TO MANOEUVRE.
293	BESIDES LABOR, CAPITAL AND TECHNOLOGY, INSTITUTIONS ARE ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR OF PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS. THEY SET A FRAMEWORK OF MOTIVATION FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THEIR EFFICIENCY. THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH PROVIDED EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE EFFECT OF INSTITUTIONAL PROGRESS ON EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS OF SEVERAL SERVICES SECTORS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE IN THE POST-CRISIS PERIOD (2011-2017). IN THE ANALYZED PERIOD THE SERVICES EXPORTS GROWTH TURNED OUT TO BE MORE STABLE THAN THE GOODS EXPORTS GROWTH. THE MULTI-COUNTRY MODELS SHOWED THAT SEVERAL TYPES OF INSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AFFECTED THE EXPORTS GROWTH IN THE MEDIUM RUN. EXCLUDING OUTLIERS, USING WEIGHTED ENLARGED SAMPLE AND ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING EXPORTS GROWTH WERE APPLIED TO ASSESS ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESEARCH RESULTS. LABOR FORCE GROWTH, GDP AND GDP PER CAPITA WERE INITIALLY USED AS CONTROL VARIABLES, BUT IN MOST CASES THEIR EFFECT FOR EXPORTS GROWTH WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. SECTOR SPECIFIC APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS TURNED OUT TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM OF THE EFFECT UNDER THE SITUATION OF SERVICES HETEROGENEITY. MONETARY FREEDOM (CURRENCY STABILITY AND MARKET-BASED PRICES) STIMULATES EXPORTS OF TRANSPORT SERVICES. THE RULE OF LAW (CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT, PROPERTY RIGHTS, EFFICIENCY OF POLICE AND COURTS, ABSENCE OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE ETC.) IS IMPORTANT FOR RAISING INTERNATIONAL TOURISM RECEIPTS. INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES SERVICES EXPORTS DEPEND PRIMARILY ON VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, RESPECTS HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREE MEDIA). AS FOR FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE SERVICES EXPORTS, NO SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL FACTOR WAS FOUND. CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, POLITICAL STABILITY, LABOR FREEDOM, GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS AND LOWER GOVERNMENT SIZE ALSO MAY BE IMPORTANT, BUT THEIR EFFECT IS NOT ROBUST OR CANNOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE EFFECT OF THE ABOVESAID FACTORS. IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT FIGHTING CORRUPTION MAY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE SERVICES EXPORTS THAN ON THE GOODS EXPORTS. THE LATTER DEPEND POSITIVELY ON THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT FREEDOM. USING THE SELECTED EU MEMBER STATES IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AS A BENCHMARKING LEVEL ENABLED US TO ESTIMATE A POTENTIAL EFFECT FOR SERVICES EXPORTS IN CASE OF UKRAINE IF IT REACHES THEIR LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN PARTICULAR THE INSTITUTIONAL PROGRESS CAN BOOST UKRAINIAN TRANSPORT, TOURISM, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES SERVICES EXPORTS BY 30-200% OR BY 10-15% OF ITS GDP.
294	IN THE PROCESS OF REGULATION OF PARTY ORGANISATIONS THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE RCP (B) USED THE TACTIC OF MASS METHODS AND TOTAL PURGES. PARTY ORGANISATIONS IN SIBERIA WERE REGULATED THE SAME WAY. SINCE JANUARY 1920 THERE WAS A RAPID GROWTH OF THE NUMBER OF COMMUNISTS IN TOMSK PROVINCE, AND ALREADY IN 1920 BY THE FIRST "PURGE" FOLLOWED. THE CAMPAIGN WAS PLANNED TO FINISH IN NOVEMBER 1920; IN FACT IT WAS COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE CAMPAIGN WAS UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO THE LACK OF THE LOCAL APPARATUS. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMMUNISTS ACTUALLY DID NOT CHANGE. IN AUGUST 1921 A PARTY-WIDE "PURGE" STARTED. THE NUMBER OF COMMUNISTS IN THE PROVINCE DECREASED DRAMATICALLY. THE EXCEPTION FROM THE PARTY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY PEOPLE'S DEPARTURE FROM THE PARTY BY THERE OWN WILL. THE "PURGE" WAS DIRECTED PRIMARILY AGAINST THOSE SOCIAL GROUPS THAT PARTY LEADER V. LENIN CONSIDERED HOSTILE. AMONG THEM WERE FORMER MILITARY OFFICERS, POLICE OFFICERS, WEALTHY PEASANTS, BELIEVERS, MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES. MANY OFFICERS DECLARED THEIR LOYALTY, AND WENT TO SERVE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, FEARING COUP THE GOVERNMENTAL PARTY DID NOT TRUST OFFICERS. ALSO COMMITTEES FOR PURGING THE PARTY WERE SUSPICIOUS TO FORMER MEMBERS OF OTHER PARTIES. BOTH OF THESE SOCIAL GROUPS WERE CAREFULLY IDENTIFIED BY PARTY COMMITTEES AND SPECIAL SERVICES FOR THE REMOVAL FROM THE RCP (B) AND SUBSEQUENT SUPERVISION. REGARDLESS OF THE SOCIAL STATUS, DRUNKARDS, THE CORRUPTED, THIEVES, CRIMINALS, TAX DEBTORS, VIOLATORS OF PARTY DISCIPLINE, RELIGIOUS RITES PERFORMERS WERE EXPELLED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL PARTY. OFTEN THE REASON FOR THE EXCEPTION WAS FORMULATED INDEFINABLY: "SELFISHNESS", "FOREIGN ELEMENT", "EXTRA BALLAST". AMONG EXCEPTIONAL REASONS WERE: MURDER, BEATING OF DETAINEES, DENIAL OF FIGHTING AGAINST BANDITS, PROMOTION OF SPECULATORS, AND AGITATION AGAINST THE RUSSIAN COMMUNIST PARTY (BOLSHEVIKS). THE LIST OF OFFENCES ALLOWED BY MEMBERS OF THE RULING PARTY SUGGESTS THAT THE COMMUNISTS DID NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF CULTURE TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW. THE NORMS OF THE PARTY ETHICS REMAINED UNCERTAIN, AS FORECLOSURES IMPOSED BY THE COMMUNISTS. IN 1920 AND 1921 THERE WERE MASS PURGES. LATER, MASS CAMPAIGNS WERE REPLACED BY REGULAR ACTIVITIES OF THE CONTROL COMMITTEE, WHICH INCLUDED SPECIAL PARTY INVESTIGATORS. EXPULSION FROM THE PARTY MEANT DISQUALIFICATION AND DISMISSAL. IN TERMS OF UNEMPLOYMENT IT WAS A PRETTY STRICT EDUCATIONAL MEASURE OF THE COMMUNISTS.
295	GOVERNMENT BAILOUTS ARE EXPENSIVE, UNJUST, AND UNPOPULAR, AND THEY USUAL!), REPRESENT DRAMATIC DEVIATIONS FROM THE RULE OF LAW. THEY ARE ALSO, IN SOME CASES, NECESSARY. THE PROBLEM THAT BAILOUTS POSE, THEN, IS THAT THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS INIMICAL TO THE INTERESTS OF SOCIETY, EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THIS COMPLEXITY IS IGNORED UNDER THE RECENT DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH IMPROBABLY GUARANTEES AN END TO TAXPAYER BAILOUTS. INDEED, MUCH OF THE ACT MAKES BAILOUTS MORE LIKELY, NOT LESS, BY MAKING THE WRONG KIND OF BAILOUTS AVAILABLE FAR TOO OFTEN. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF BAILOUTS BY RETAINING GOVERNMENTAL ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT KINDS OF BAILOUTS POSSIBLE THROUGH FORCING THE BAILED-OUT FIRMS TO INTERNALIZE THE BAILOUT COSTS. THE PROPOSAL-CALLED "ELECTIVE SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY''-ALLOWS BANK SHAREHOLDERS TWO OPTIONS. THEY MUST EITHER CHANGE THEIR BANK'S CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO INCLUDE DRAMATICALLY LESS DEBT, CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION OF LEADING ECONOMISTS; OR ALTERNATIVELY, THEY MUST ADD A BAILOUT EXCEPTION TO THEIR BANK'S LIMITED-SHAREHOLDER-LIABILITY STATUS, THUS REQUIRING SHAREHOLDERS-NOT TAXPAYERS-TO COVER THE ULTIMATE COSTS OF THE BANK'S FAILURE. THIS LIABILITY WOULD BE STRUCTURED AS A GOVERNMENTAL COLLECTION, SIMILAR TO A TAX ASSESSMENT, FOR THE RECOUPMENT OF ALL BAILOUT COSTS AGAINST THE SHAREHOLDERS ON A PRO RATA BASIS. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE AN UP-FRONT STAY ON COLLECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE, IN FACT, TAXPAYER LOSSES TO BE RECOUPED AND TO MITIGATE GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES FOR OVERBAILOUT, POLITICAL MANIPULATION, AND CRISIS EXACERBATION. THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE WOULD ALSO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE THE SHAREHOLDERS' USE OF THE CORPORATE FORM TO EVADE LIABILITY NULL AND VOID, AND WOULD REQUIRE THAT SHAREHOLDERS WHO LITIGATE AGAINST COLLECTION AND SUBSEQUENTLY LOSE PAY TREBLE DAMAGES. INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT'S LITIGATION COSTS. ELECTIVE SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY ANTICIPATES, AMONG ITS MANY BENEFITS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DERIVATIVES MARKET THAT WOULD INSURE SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST LIABILITY, THE PRICE OF WHICH WILL CONTAIN MORE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT RISK CONCENTRATION THAN IS PRESENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. AFTER EXPLAINING THE STRUCTURE AND OTHER BENEFITS OF ELECTIVE SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES SEVERAL POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS. CLOSE INSPECTION OF THESE OBJECTIONS, HOWEVER, REVEALS THAT THE OVERALL CASE FOR ELECTIVE SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY IS STRONG AS A MATTER OF HISTORY, LAW, AND ECONOMICS, THOUGH PERHAPS NOT POLITICS.
296	OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, SINCE THE LATE JUSTICE SCALIA JOINED THE COURT AND USHERED IN A NEW ERA OF TEXT-FOCUSED STATUTORY ANALYSIS, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED MOVE TOWARDS THE HOLISTIC INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES AND "MAKING SENSE OF THE CORPUS JURIS." IN PARTICULAR, JUSTICES ON THE MODERN SUPREME COURT NOW REGULARLY COMPARE OR ANALOGIZE BETWEEN STATUTES THAT CONTAIN SIMILAR WORDS OR PHRASES-WHAT SOME HAVE CALLED THE "WHOLE CODE RULE." DESPITE THE PREVALENCE OF THIS INTERPRETIVE PRACTICE, HOWEVER, SCHOLARS HAVE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO HOW THE COURT ACTUALLY ENGAGES IN WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS ON THE GROUND. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THE FIRST EMPIRICAL AND DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS OF HOW THE MODERN SUPREME COURT USES WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS, BASED ON A STUDY OF 532 STATUTORY CASES DECIDED DURING THE ROBERTS COURT'S FIRST TWELVE-AND-A-HALF TERMS. THE ARTICLE FIRST CATALOGUES FIVE DIFFERENT FORMS OF WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS EMPLOYED BY THE MODERN COURT AND NOTES THAT THE DIFFERENT FORMS REST ON DIFFERENT JUSTIFICATIONS, ALTHOUGH THE COURT'S RHETORIC HAS TENDED TO IGNORE THESE DISTINCTIONS. THE ARTICLE THEN NOTES SEVERAL PROBLEMS, BEYOND THE UNREALISTIC ONE-CONGRESS ASSUMPTION IDENTIFIED BY OTHER SCHOLARS, THAT PLAGUE THE COURT'S CURRENT APPROACH TO MOST FORMS OF WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS. FOR EXAMPLE, MOST OF THE COURT'S STATUTORY COMPARISONS INVOLVE STATUTES THAT HAVE NO EXPLICIT CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER, AND NEARLY ONE-THIRD COMPARE STATUTES THAT REGULATE ENTIRELY UNRELATED SUBJECT AREAS. MOREOVER, MORE THAN A FEW OF THE COURT'S ANALOGIES INVOLVE GENERIC STATUTORY PHRASES-SUCH AS "BECAUSE OF" OR "ANY"-WHOSE MEANING IS LIKELY TO DEPEND ON CONTEXT RATHER THAN SOME UNIVERSAL RULE OF LOGIC OR LINGUISTICS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IN THE END, THE COURT'S WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS AMOUNT TO JUDICIAL DRAFTING PRESUMPTIONS THAT ASSIGN FIXED MEANINGS TO SPECIFIC WORDS, PHRASES, AND STRUCTURAL CHOICES. THE ARTICLE CRITIQUES THIS JUDICIAL IMPOSITION OF DRAFTING CONVENTIONS ON CONGRESS-NOTING THAT IT IS UNPREDICTABLE, LEADS TO ENORMOUS JUDICIAL DISCRETION, REFLECTS AN UNREALISTIC VIEW OF HOW CONGRESS DRAFTS, AND FALLS FAR OUTSIDE THE JUDICIARY'S INSTITUTIONAL EXPERTISE. IT CONCLUDES BY RECOMMENDING THAT THE COURT LIMIT ITS USE OF WHOLE CODE COMPARISONS TO SITUATIONS IN WHICH CONGRESSIONAL DRAFTING PRACTICES, RULE OF LAW CONCERNS, OR JUDICIAL EXPERTISE JUSTIFY THE PRACTICE-E.G., WHERE CONGRESS ITSELF HAS MADE CLEAR THAT ONE STATUTE BORROWED FROM OR INCORPORATED THE PROVISIONS OF ANOTHER, OR WHERE JUDICIAL ACTION IS NECESSARY TO HARMONIZE TWO RELATED STATUTES WITH EACH OTHER.
297	ARTICLE 333 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (HEREAFTER THE CC OF THE RF) AS AMENDED PROVIDES THE RIGHT OF THE COURTS TO REDUCE THE FORFEIT PENALTY IF IT IS OBVIOUSLY DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BREACH OF AN OBLIGATION. UPON COMMENCEMENT OF PART I OF THE ABOVE CODE WE CAN EVALUATE THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 333 BY THE COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION AND ARBITRATION COURTS AS A STABLE ONE. THIS STABILITY WAS ENSURED BY DAY-TO DAY EXPLANATIONS GIVEN BY THE HIGHEST RUSSIAN JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ON THE CONDITIONS OF FORFEIT REDUCTION. THE POSITION OF THE ABOVE COURTS COMES DOWN NOT TO THE RIGHT BUT TO THE OBLIGATION OF THE COURTS TO REDUCE THE FORFEIT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY PLAINTIFF'S RESPECTABLE INTEREST INCLUDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE SOME INDIRECT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BREACH OF AN OBLIGATION. THE FORFEIT COULD BE REDUCED IN ANY COURT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE CLAIM OF A DEBTOR EVEN IF THE CASE HAD NOT BEEN DECIDED IN THE LOWER COURT. SUCH AN APPROACH TO THE APPLICATION OF THE ABOVE RULE OF LAW BY THE COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION AND ARBITRATION COURTS CORRESPONDED TO THE POSITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. BUT FROM 2005 TO 2010 THERE WERE SOME FLUCTUATIONS AND, FINALLY, THE DEPARTURE OF THE SUPREME ARBITRATION COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FROM EARLIER ENUNCIATED PRINCIPLED STANDS ON THE APPLICATION OF THE ABOVE ARTICLE. IN CONTRAST TO THIS, THE PRACTICE OF THE COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE AT THAT TIME COULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY THE STABILITY IN APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 333 OF THE CC OF THE RF AND A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE LAW IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS EXPLANATIONS. THE RULING OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (HEREAFTER THE ECHR), IN THE CASE GALICH V. RUSSIA, HAS OBLIGATED RUSSIA TO CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED CASE LAW AS FAR AS THE TERMS OF APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 333 ARE CONCERNED. THE ECHR STATES THAT RUSSIAN COURTS ARE THEORETICALLY EMPOWERED TO REDUCE INTERESTS TO BE LEVIED; HOWEVER, APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 333 OF THE CC OF THE RF IS THE PREROGATIVE OF COURTS BUT NOT THEIR DUTY. A COURT HAS NO RIGHT TO REDUCE A FORFEIT UNLESS THERE IS AN APPLICATION OF THE DEFENDANT. THE REALIZATION OF THE ABOVE POSITION OF THE ECHR IN OUR DOMESTIC JUDICIAL PRACTICE AND ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE.
298	TANZANIA IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A MAJOR EXPORTER OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) IN THE FUTURE, FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY OF NATURAL GAS RESERVES TOTALLING 57.25 TRILLION NORMAL CUBIC FEET (TCF). IN LINDI, TANZANIA, A PROPOSAL IS BEING MADE TO EXPORT TWO-TRAIN LNG, A US$ 30 BILLION LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) PROJECT. HOWEVER, IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE EXISTING LCP WILL BE ENOUGH TO PREVENT TANZANIA FROM FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF OTHER RESOURCERICH AFRICAN COUNTRIES, SUCH AS ALGERIA, EGYPT, ANGOLA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, AND SOMALIA, WHICH HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED RESOURCE-RELATED WARS, DISPUTES, CRISES, AND CONFLICTS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TANZANIAN UPSTREAM NATURAL GAS SECTOR'S LOCAL CONTENT POLICY, LEGAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. A QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED UTILISING A SWOT ANALYSIS ON LOCAL CONTENT POLICY, LEGAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE AUTHORS USED THE SWOT (STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, AND THREATS) ANALYSIS TO CONDUCT A NARRATIVE DOCUMENT REVIEW AND LITERATURE REVIEW. THE SWOT APPROACH IS WELL-STRUCTURED AND ENABLES BOTH DESCRIPTIVE AND CROSS-SECTIONAL QUALITATIVE STUDIES. IN ADDITION, THE SWOT ANALYSIS HELPS DRAW A PORTRAIT OF HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT SUITABLE POLICIES, INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS, AND REGULATIONS ADAPTED TO LOCAL NEEDS. THE STUDY FINDS THAT TANZANIA'S LEGAL, POLICY, AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL CONTENT IN THE UPSTREAM NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY OFFERS VARIOUS STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES; IT ALSO HAS SEVERAL WEAKNESSES AND THREATS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. FIRST, TANZANIA'S LOCAL CONTENT POLICY, REGULATORY, AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS FAILED TO CONSIDER THE ACTUAL STATE OF TANZANIAN INDUSTRY OR INDIGENOUS TANZANIAN FIRMS' PREPAREDNESS AND INDUSTRIAL CAPACITY. SECOND, TANZANIA'S LOCAL CONTENT IS LIMITED BY A LACK OF GOVERNMENT COORDINATION WITH OTHER OIL AND GAS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. PRIORITISING LOCAL SUPPLIERS IS PART OF THE LOCAL CONTENT POLICY, WHICH ALSO EASES EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR LOCAL FIRMS. THE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AT STAKE ARE THE RULE OF LAW, BUREAUCRATIC QUALITY, GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, AND THE RISK OF EXPROPRIATION AND CONTRACT REPUDIATION. FINALLY, UNREGULATED LOBBYING CAN LEAD TO REGULATORY CAPTURE BY SPECIAL INTERESTS OR LIMITED POLICY OPTIONS. THESE FINDINGS APPLY TO ANY CONTEXT AND CAN BE UTILISED BY DECISION-MAKERS, MANAGERS, EXPERTS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FOCUS ON SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AND IDENTIFY AREAS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.
299	MOST STATES IN EAST ASIA HAD UNDERGONE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE, INVASION, OR COLONIZATION UNDER THE WEST POWERS BEFORE THEY FINALLY EMBRACED MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM. WHILE NOWADAYS MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM SEEMS TO HAVE ENJOYED UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE AND WORLDWIDE PRACTICE, WHAT RELATIVELY TENDS TO BE IGNORED IS THE STRUGGLE OF THE RECIPIENT STATES TO EMBRACE, ADAPT, AND ACCOMMODATE THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM THEY INHERITED TO THEIR LOCAL POLITICAL AND SOCIAL-ECONOMIC CONTEXT. THE VERY ISSUE WHICH ESPECIALLY ATTRACTS LEGAL SCHOLARS' ATTENTION IS HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, USUALLY ASSIGNED THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE AS THE GUARDIAN OF CONSTITUTION IN MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM, MANAGES TO SAFEGUARD CONSTITUTIONALISM WHILE ALSO ATTENDS TO THE NEEDS OF SOCIAL-POLITICAL TRANSITION. IN EAST ASIA, JAPAN WAS THE CASE THAT ALWAYS APPEAL TO THE CURIOSITY OF LEGAL SCHOLARS. HISTORY PROVES THE ASTOUNDING MIRACLE OF JAPAN'S NOTABLE SUCCESS IN HOW IT MANAGED TO SEEK NATIONAL IDENTITY, RECONSTRUCTED ITS SOCIETY, AND ACHIEVED ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AFTER FOREIGN OCCUPATION. INTERESTINGLY, HOWEVER, AS IF SERVING AS THE COMPARISON TO THE BOOMING DEVELOPMENT OF THE POST-WAR JAPAN, THE SUPREME COURT OF JAPAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN KNOWN AS A TYPICAL OF A CONSERVATIVE COURT WITH UNEQUIVOCAL DEFERENT TENDENCY TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT MAKES ONE WONDERS IF THE COURT COULD HAVE HAD TO DO WITH THE SUCCESS OF JAPAN'S NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, AND EVER PLAYED ANY SIGNIFICANT ROLE CONTRIBUTING TO JAPAN'S REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SUPREME COURT OF JAPAN'S RULING UPON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CABINET ORDER NO. 325 IN 1952. IT WAS A LANDMARK CASE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COURT, IN WHICH THE STATUS OF THE OCCUPATION WAS REVIEWED FOR THE FIRST TIME, WITH THE ORDERS OF THE SACP CALLED INTO QUESTION AS CONTRAVENE THE CONSTITUTION. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO, THROUGH A CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS IN LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL-POLITICAL BACKGROUND, REVISIT THIS CASE AND EXPLORE THE COURT'S CONTRIBUTION BY RENDERING THIS DECISION IN RESPONSE TO THE NATION'S NEED OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE COURT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS ADJUDICATION. IN CONTRAST TO THE GENERAL ASSUMPTION OF THE COURT'S CONSERVATIVE TENDENCY, THE COURT IN THIS CASE WAS CONSCIOUS AND STRATEGIC TO ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL IDENTITY, UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, AND EMPOWERING THE BURGEONING CIVIL SOCIETY.
300	TO WHAT EXTENT DO ASYLUM DECISIONS WITHIN THE EU AMOUNT TO AN EU ASYLUM POLICY? THE PAPER TACKLES THE QUESTION WITHIN A SIMPLIFIED AND AMENDED FRAMEWORK RECOMMENDED BY LASSWELL AND MCDOUGAL'S POLICY ANALYSIS (THE AMENDMENT IS THAT THE POSTULATION OF BASIC PUBLIC ORDER GOALS HAS THREE INTERRELATED FUNCTIONS: THE EXPLICATION OF EVALUATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ENTERTAINED BY A POLICY ANALYST; THE ARTICULATION, APPRAISAL, REVISION AND ORDERING OF THE ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH RESULT IN A PRESCRIPTION OF PUBLIC ORDER GOALS; THE IDENTIFICATION AND ORDERING, FROM AMONG A POTENTIALLY ENDLESS FLOW OF EMPIRICAL DATA, OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT CONFORM TO THE POSTULATED GOALS). THE PRINCIPAL POSTULATED GOAL IS HUMAN DIGNITY OR A FREE SOCIETY. SUBORDINATE GOALS INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO LIFE, THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM, THE RULE OF LAW, AND SOLIDARITY. THE ANALYSIS OF TENDENCIES IN DECISION, ALTHOUGH EXHAUSTIVE, DOES NOT SUFFICE TO GIVE AN UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER TO THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION. A MAJOR REASON IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE EU TREATIES AND DIRECTIVES ON ASYLUM, WHICH ALLEGEDLY ARE THE BASIC AND THE IMPLEMENTING EU INSTRUMENTS RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT THAT MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE AN INSUFFICIENT INCENTIVE FOR THE PROPER HARMONISATION OF NATIONAL ASYLUM SYSTEMS, AND LEAVE A TOO HIGH LEVEL OF DISCRETION TO THE MEMBER STATES REGARDING THE TRANSPOSITION OF THE LEGAL ACQUIS INTO NATIONAL SYSTEMS. THE EUROPEANIZATION OF ASYLUM POLICY HAS NOT BEEN INSPIRED BY HUMANITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS, BUT BY POLICIES OF THE MEMBER STATES TO DISCOURAGE AND PREVENT ASYLUM SEEKERS TO ACCESS STATE TERRITORIES ON THE ONE HAND, AND TO PROMPTLY AND EFFICIENTLY PROCESS ASYLUM APPLICATIONS ON THE OTHER. EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS WILL PROBABLY KEEP PUTTING EFFORTS INTO THE BUILDING OF THE COMMON ASYLUM SYSTEM AND HARMONISATION OF NATIONAL ASYLUM SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE PROCEDURE AND UNIFORM REFUGEE STATUS AT THE LEVEL OF THE ENTIRE UNION. HOWEVER, THE QUESTION NOW ARISES AS TO WHAT DEGREE THE MEMBER STATES WILL ACTUALLY HARMONISE THEIR NATIONAL ASYLUM SYSTEMS WITH THE SPECIFIED HIGHER STANDARDS. EVEN AN APPROPRIATE ASYLUM SYSTEM WILL BE OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE IF IT IS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCESS TO THE ASYLUM SYSTEM AND PROTECTION IN THE EU TERRITORY. CHANGES IN THE POLICY OF MANAGEMENT OF THE EXTERNAL BORDERS, WHICH RESTRICTS ACCESS TO THE ASYLUM POLICY IN VARIOUS WAYS, ARE NECESSARY SO AS TO ENSURE FULL RESPECT FOR THE RIGHT TO SEEK ASYLUM.
301	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CENTRAL PURPOSE OF US. CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE IS THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FOR THE COMMON GOOD. MEMBERS OF ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT MUST FULFILL THAT PUBLIC TRUST THROUGH JUST POLICIES AND ACTIONS. THE MAXIM OF CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE ESTABLISHES A STABLE FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW, REQUIRING GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION IN A NONARBITRARY MANNER. IT PROVIDES THE PEOPLE WITH CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY ABOUT THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENTAL POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THE FOUNDATIONAL DICTATE OF GOVERNANCE IS INCORPORATED INTO THE US. CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION THROUGH THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION. THOSE TWO DOCUMENTS REFLECT THE NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO PROMULGATING LAWS THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO BOTH THE PUBLIC GOOD AND THE PERSONAL PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. THE FEDERAL LEGAL SYSTEM MUST INTEGRATE PROTECTIONS OF RIGHTS FOR THE COMMON GOOD INTO STATUTES, REGULATIONS, AND JUDICIAL OPINIONS THAT ADDRESS A PLETHORA OF SOCIAL DEMANDS AND PROBLEMS. THE PROJECT OF MAXIM CONSTITUTIONALISM RUNS COUNTER TO POSITIVIST SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MAXIM CONSTITUTIONALISM REFLECTS THE NORMATIVE UNDERPINNING OF LEGAL ORDER THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH PLURALISTIC SELF-GOVERNANCE. THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS FOR THE COMMON GOOD FACILITATES THE WORKINGS OF A POLITY THAT TOLERATES DEBATE AND DELIBERATION. THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAWS FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT ENJOINS TYRANNICAL MAJORITARIANISM AND ABUSE OF STATE AUTHORITY. LIKE ORIGINALISM, MAXIM CONSTITUTIONALISM UTILIZES HISTORICAL ANALYSIS. BUT IT DEPARTS FROM ORIGINALISM BY DENYING THAT THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE CONSTITUTION'S TEXT SHOULD BE DETERMINATIVE. MAXIM CONSTITUTIONALISM IS A BINDING NORM THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL MIND FRAME, WHETHER PAST OR PRESENT. IN ADDITION, THOUGH THE FORWARD PROGRESS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IS INFORMED BY JUDICIAL OPINIONS, IT IS NOT DEFINED BY THEM ALONE. CONGRESS MUST ALSO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN IDENTIFYING RIGHTS AND PROMULGATING STATUTES FOR THEIR PROTECTION. RECOGNIZING THIS BEDROCK PURPOSE OF GOVERNANCE DISTINGUISHES MAXIM CONSTITUTIONALISM FROM PROMINENT STRANDS OF LIVING CONSTITUTIONALISM BY FURNISHING AN OBJECTIVE AND ENDURING STANDARD FOR EVALUATING THE LEGITIMACY OF GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS. THE ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC CONDUCT IS NOT PROCEDURALLY NEUTRAL BUT SUBSTANTIVELY RICH IN ITS ACCOUNT OF HOW GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS SHOULD FURTHER THE PUBLIC GOOD THROUGH A LEGAL SYSTEM DESIGNED TO SECURE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS FOR AN EQUAL CITIZENRY.
302	LAWFUL ACCESS-THE LEGAL REGIME THAT AUTHORIZES VARIOUS METHODS USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INTERCEPT, SEARCH, OR SEIZE INFORMATION FOR INVESTIGATORY PURPOSES-HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO MUCH DEBATE IN CANADA. HOWEVER, THOSE DEBATES NEED A NEW SOLUTION SPACE FOR THE DIGITAL AGE. THIS MUST BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS FOR MINIMIZING RIGHTS INFRINGEMENTS AND PROVIDE NEW FORMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND SAFEGUARDS AGAINST MISUSE. THIS IS NOT SIMPLY A MATTER OF ADOPTING THE POPULAR FRAMEWORK OF "PRIVACY BY DESIGN," OR EVEN A REWORKED "LAWFUL ACCESS BY DESIGN." WE ARGUE THAT AN APPRECIATION OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE DIGITAL WORLD REQUIRES US TO RETHINK OUR BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE CANADIAN CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LAWFUL ACCESS WAS SET OUT BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN HUNTER V SOUTHAM AND WAS THEN REFINED IN THE SUBSEQUENT JURISPRUDENCE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK IS ILL-SUITED TO CONTEMPORARY DIGITAL CHALLENGES TO INFORMATIONAL PRIVACY AND REQUIRES FOUR FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS. FIRST, THIS FRAMEWORK'S BASIC POINT-OF-COLLECTION FOCUS NEEDS TO SHIFT TO THE BROADER LIFE CYCLE OF THE DATA. SECOND, THIS FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM ITS CATEGORICAL APPROACH TO INFORMATIONAL PRIVACY, WHERE SOME CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION ARE THOUGHT TO BE INHERENTLY MORE PRIVATE THAN OTHERS, AND INSTEAD APPROACH INFORMATIONAL PRIVACY IN TERMS OF THE USE-CONTEXT OF THE DATA. THIRD, THIS FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM ITS EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS AT THE POINT OF COLLECTION (E.G., THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT), AND CONSIDER PROCEDURAL, LEGISLATIVE, AND TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE DATA AS WELL. OVERALL, THIS FRAMEWORK NEEDS TO SHIFT AWAY FROM A DOMINANT FOCUS ON PRIVACY AND RECOGNIZE A BROADER SET OF RIGHTS AND INTERESTS AT STAKE IN LAWFUL ACCESS PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW, EQUALITY, AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. ONCE WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT IS BETTER ABLE TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL ERA, THEN WE CAN MORE PRECISELY CRAFT NEW TECHNIQUES FOR PROTECTING RIGHTS, ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY, AND SAFEGUARDING AGAINST ABUSE WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK. INDEED, WE CAN THEN SEE WHY SOME OF THESE TECHNIQUES ARE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THE PAYOFF FOR DOING SO, WE ARGUE, IS A WAY OF ENABLING SPECIFIC JUSTIFIED USES OF DATA BY LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE DATA AGAINST NON-JUSTIFIED USES OVER ITS LIFE SPAN.
303	THROUGHOUT THE DISSERTATION, REGARDING AN ALL ENCOMPASSING DEPICTION OF THE THERAPEUTIC MEASURE - THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL-WE ENDEAVOUR TO FIND ITS POSITION WITHIN THE DOMESTIC CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEM. IT IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE THESIS THAT THE ANSWER OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REGARDING OFFENCES OF GENERALLY DANGEROUS PERPETRATORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WHEN COMMITTING A CRIMINAL OFFENCE (WHICH MAY RANGE FROM FULL ACCOUNTABILITY, WHICH RENDERS THEM CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE, TO FULL INACCOUNTABILITY, WHEN THEY CANNOT BE HELD CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE), NEEDS TO HE SOUGHT. THE ENTIRE ARTICLE IS ELABORATED ON THESE GROUNDS THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL, WHICH IS A 'GUEST' IN CRIMINAL LAW, WHEREAS 'AT TOME' IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE, FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY, IS PRESENTED AS AN INSTITUTE REPRESENTING AN ABSOLUTE NOVELTY FOR DOMESTIC LEGISLATION OWING TO A COMPLETE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON IT IN THE SLOVENIAN ENVIRONMENT, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO LIMIT ONESELF ONLY TO THE MOST NARROWLY DEFINED NUCLEUS OF THE NOTION OF FORENSIC HOSPITAL. THUS, WE SOUGHT TO PRESENT IT FROM AS MANY DIFFERENT ANGLES AS POSSIBLE, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY HIGHLIGHTING OPEN ISSUES AND DILEMMAS, SEARCHING FOR APPROPRIATE ANSWERS AND SOLUTIONS NECESSARY, WITH A VIEW TO THIS INSTITUTE ACQUIRING ITS PLACE IN CRIMINAL LEGAL THEORY, WHILE ALSO BEING ASSERTED IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE. IN THE FIRST PART, WE FOCUSED UPON A SHORT HISTORICAL REVIEW OF (IN)ACCOUNTABILITY AND OF ELEMENTS OF THE INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC HOSPITAL, MEANING THAT WE SUBTLY EXPOSED THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE ARTICLE, IN PARTICULAR THE FORENSIC PATIENT - THE PERSON, WHO AFTER COMMITTING THE SOCIALLY DANGEROUS OFFENCE IS INITITALLY TREATED JUDICIALLY, AND THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL AS THE PLACE WHERE THE PERPETRATOR IS SITUATED TO BE FURTHER TREATED MEDICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIMARY NATURE OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, WE DREW ATTENTION TO THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF RULE OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, WHICH THE JUDICIARY NEEDS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT UNTIL THE SUBSTANTIAL DECISION. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION, WE ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT THE LEGAL GROUNDS FOR POSITIONING THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL. IN ORDER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH THE NEW INSTITUTE WHICH WOULD CONTRIBUTE - ALONG WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE CRIMINAL CODE (KZ-1)-TOWARDS A MORE STATE OF THE ART, DEVELOPED AND PURPOSEFUL CRIMINAL LAW POENALIZATION THUS, WE APPLIED TO A GREATER EXTENT THE HISTORICAL, I.E. 'DESK RESEARCH', 'CASE STUDY', AND THE PRACTICAL METHOD.
304	COOPERATION IN LEGAL SERVICES BETWEEN COUNTRIES IS AN IMPORTANT GUARANTEE FOR COOPERATION IN OTHER FIELDS. SINCE THE "ONE BELT AND ONE WAY" STRATEGY WAS PUT FORWARD, CHINA AND UZBEKISTAN HAVE STRENGTHENED COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF POLITICS, ECONOMY AND TRADE, HUMANITIES AND OTHER FIELDS, BUT COOPERATION IN LEGAL SERVICES REMAINS AT A PRELIMINARY STAGE. STRENGTHENING COOPERATION IN LEGAL SERVICES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS AN INEVITABLE REQUIREMENT TO FURTHER EXPAND ECONOMIC AND TRADE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IT IS ALSO A MAJOR BOOST TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SCO AND PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCO LEGAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. AT PRESENT, THE COOPERATION OF LEGAL SERVICES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED WITH TWO PROBLEMS: ONE IS THAT THE LEGAL LEVEL OF THE TWO COUNTRIES IS DIFFERENT, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE MUTUAL RECOGNITION; THE OTHER IS THAT THERE ARE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL BARRIERS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, AND THERE IS A LACK OF QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS-LAWYERS WHO CAN UNDERSTAND THE LAWS AND LANGUAGES OF THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN THIS REGARD, THE TWO COUNTRIES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE THEORETICAL STUDY OF INVESTMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, IMPROVE THE INSTRUMENTS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ON THE BASIS OF THE ORIGINAL INVESTMENT PROTECTION AGREEMENTS, JOINTLY TRAIN SPECIALISTS WITH BOTH LANGUAGE AND LAW SKILLS, AND STRIVE TO CREATE A COMPLETE LEGAL SERVICE SYSTEM INCLUDING A LEGAL CENTER FOR THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF FOREIGN-FUNDED ENTERPRISES, A DATABASE OF INVESTMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, LEGAL SERVICE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND LEGAL SERVICE PERSONNEL TRAINING.
305	NATURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL HAZARDS CAN HAVE CONSEQUENCES OF A SCALE AND SEVERITY FAR EXCEEDING MOST HUMAN EXPERIENCE. MASSIVE EARTHQUAKES PREDICTED AS IMMINENT FOR SOME REGIONS OF THE WORLD, FIRES ENGULFING LARGE TRACTS OF LAND AND THE GLOBAL COVID-19 PANDEMIC OF 2020 ILLUSTRATE SEVERAL KEY PREPAREDNESS CHALLENGES. THE HAZARDS LITERATURE STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF INVOLVING COMMUNITIES IN DECISIONS BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER CALAMITOUS EVENTS OCCUR. CURRENTLY, COMMUNITY PLANNING AND HAZARD RISK MANAGEMENT PLANNING ARE LARGELY CARRIED OUT IN SEPARATE TRACKS THAT SELDOM INTERSECT. WE PROPOSE THAT HAZARD RISK MANAGERS MAY BENEFIT FROM INTEGRATING IN THEIR APPROACHES COLLABORATIVE PLANNING PRINCIPLES, ESPECIALLY AT THE PRE-DISASTER STAGE. WE FURTHER PROPOSE THAT COMMUNITY PLANNERS DELIBERATELY CONSIDER HAZARDS AND INTEGRATE THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A DISASTER INTO ROUTINE PLAN-MAKING, BOOSTING COMMUNITIES' RESILIENCE. FINALLY, SINCE CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IS NECESSARY BUT BURDENSOME IN BOTH PLANNING AND HAZARDS MANAGEMENT, WE SUGGEST A SET OF CRITERIA FOR CONSIDERING WHO-FROM AMONG THE MANY COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS-SHOULD BE INVOLVED, WHEN, AND HOW.
306	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE PHENOMENON OF FEDERAL RELATIONS IN MODERN RUSSIA FROM A THEORETICAL AND NORMATIVE POINT OF VIEW. STUDYING RELATED CATEGORIES, SUCH AS FEDERALISM, FEDERATION AND FEDERAL SYSTEM, THE AUTHOR COMES TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS FEDERAL RELATIONS, WHICH BY THEIR NATURE ARE PURELY LEGAL RELATIONS, ARE THE CORE OF ANY FEDERAL SYSTEM. IT IS THE ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICS OF DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RELATIONS THAT SHOWS THE VIABILITY OF A PARTICULAR FEDERAL SYSTEM. USING THE CONCEPT OF SYSTEMS THEORY, THE AUTHOR REVEALS THE STRUCTURE OF FEDERAL RELATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES THEIR SUBJECTS, OBJECTS AND CONTENT. IN TURN, THE CONTENT OF FEDERAL RELATIONS CAN BE REVEALED USING THE PRINCIPLES OF BOTH THE HORIZONTAL AND THE VERTICAL SEPARATION OF POWERS. IN THIS REGARD, NOT ONLY NORMATIVE REGULATION (THE CONSTITUTION, FEDERAL AND REGIONAL LAWS), BUT ALSO JUDICIAL PRACTICE ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE: NAMELY, DECISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH HANDED DOWN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DECISIONS REVEALING THE ESSENCE OF FEDERAL RELATIONS IN SPECIFIC CASES AND RESOLVING EXISTING PROBLEMS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACTUAL FEDERAL RELATIONS CAN BE TRACED IN EXAMPLES OF AN INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY NATURE. VIVID EXAMPLES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF A NEW CONSTITUENT ENTITY OF THE FEDERATION AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUENT ENTITY IN THE FEDERATION. SUCH EXAMPLES HAVE OCCURRED IN MODERN RUSSIA, ALTHOUGH IN THE CASE OF THE ADOPTION OF NEW ENTITIES IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK, CERTAIN PROBLEMS ARE FOUND THAT SHOULD BE ELIMINATED BY MAKING APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS TO THE LAW GOVERNING THE PROCEDURE FOR SUCH ADOPTION. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, UNFORTUNATELY, HAS AFFECTED VIRTUALLY EVERY NATION IN THE WORLD. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL CENTER AND THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE FEDERATION IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION HAS BEEN AFFECTED TOO AND HAS UNDERGONE CERTAIN CHANGES. THEIR ANALYSIS CANNOT BUT LEAD TO A CORRECTION OF THE NORMATIVE REGULATION OF FEDERAL RELATIONS IN THE EVENT OF SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN THE FUTURE. AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAVE AFFECTED A LARGE LAYER OF PUBLIC RELATIONS. FEDERAL RELATIONS ARE NO EXCEPTION, SINCE THE "FEDERATED STRUCTURE" SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDES A NUMBER OF RATHER INTERESTING CHANGES.
307	SINCE 2015 CHINA HAS BEEN ACTIVELY DEVELOPING THE CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE COMPREHENSIVE PILOT AREAS. THEY ARE ONE OF THE MECHANISMS THAT THE PRC HAS BEEN PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN THE DIGITAL ERA. ENTERPRISES REGISTERED IN THE CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE COMPREHENSIVE PILOT AREAS ENJOY PREFERENTIAL TAX POLICIES AND MAY DRAW UPON THE SUPPORT MEASURES DELIVERED BY PROVINCES AND MUNICIPALITIES. THE STATE COUNCIL ALSO INTRODUCED THE "SIX SYSTEMS AND TWO PLATFORMS" PRINCIPLE WHICH REVOLUTIONIZED THE SPHERE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION OF CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE TRADE. THIS HELPS TO SOLVE MANY THE PROBLEMS CONCERNING TAXATION, CUSTOMS CLEARANCE AND LOGISTICS. ANALYSIS OF CHINESE LEGISLATION AND LOCAL REGULATIONS ILLUSTRATES THAT THE PRC ELABORATED A NEW TYPE OF ECONOMIC ZONE INTEGRATING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES INTO THE GLOBAL TRADE MARKET. A COMPARISON OF CHINESE POLICY WITH A RUSSIAN INITIATIVE TO INTRODUCE NEW EXPERIMENTAL REGIMES FOR FOREIGN ONLINE TRADE SHOWS THAT BOTH STATES COULD COOPERATE BY ESTABLISHING A JOINT MECHANISM FOR CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE PROMOTION. RUSSIA ALSO COULD USE CHINA'S EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO LAUNCH ITS OWN SYSTEM OF CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE SUPPORT.
308	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT IS THE SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL ENVI-RONMENTAL POLLUTION RISKS OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THE ALLOCATION OF THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES IN THE EIA APPROVAL PROCESS IS AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE EIA LAW. IN ORDER TO ANALYZE THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE DIRECTION OF CLARIFYING THE COOPERATION OF MULTIPLE SUBJECTS IN THE REFORM OF CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT LAW, THIS STUDY, ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACT THEORY AND INCENTIVE COMPATIBILITY PRINCIPLE, COMPARED THE INSTITUTIONAL ROLES OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED THREE SUBJECTS FOR INTEGRATED UTILITY OPTIMIZATION, BY WEIGHING THEIR INTERESTS IN THE EIA PROCEDURE. IT CAN BE FOUND THAT NOT ONLY THE EXCESSIVE GUIDANCE BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON LOCAL EIA PROCEDURES IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL ECONOMIES, BUT THE INDEPENDENCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CONDUCTING EIA PROCEDURES WILL LEAD TO THE EIA PROCEDURES GIVING WAY TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS. AS A CONCLUSION, ONLY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND THE PUBLIC JOINTLY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EIA SYSTEM. THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE A THEO-RETICAL BASIS FOR A NEW ROUND OF REVISION OF CHINA'S EIA LAW, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF GOOD GOVERNANCE OF THE EIA SYSTEM BY ENHANCING THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.
309	CHINA'S FAST INDUSTRIALIZATION AND ECONOMIC EXPANSION HAS LED TO ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, PROMPTING THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT A SLEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND LAWS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW CHINA'S STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND LEGISLATION HAVE IMPACTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY. THE STUDY'S PANEL OF CHINESE COMPANIES CONFIRMED THAT MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS REALLY SPURRED INNOVATION IN GREEN TECHNOLOGY. THIS RESEARCH LENDS CREDENCE TO THE PREMISE THAT STRICTER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ARE HELPFUL IN INSPIRING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEANER TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY HELP MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT TIGHTER ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION INCREASES ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY'S EFFECT ON TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. ACCORDING TO THESE RESULTS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAW MAY IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY BY PROVIDING A HOSPITABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINESE POLICYMAKERS COMMITTED TO FOSTERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THE NEED OF RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENTAL RULES TO SUPPORT COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAT PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREENER TECHNOLOGY IS EMPHASIZED. THE RESULTS SHED EVEN MORE LIGHT ON HOW CRUCIAL IT IS TO ENFORCE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES ARE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED. IN ESSENCE, THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE EXPANDING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE LINK BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENT BY ILLUMINATING THE POTENTIAL FOR CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND LAW TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENCOURAGE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. CHINA'S INVESTMENT IN GREEN TECH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MAY MITIGATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY ITS RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH.
310	THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BUDGET HAS NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS AT ITS DISPOSAL, AND IMPLEMENTS THE SAME THROUGH THE REGULATION ON CONDITIONALITY REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW, GUIDELINES FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION, THEN ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, PROTECTION MEASURES (EVERY EURO IS SPENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULES AND IT CREATES ADDED VALUE, THE ACTIVITIES OF THE EUROPEAN ANTI-FRAUD OFFICE (OLAF), PUBLIC INTERNAL CONTROL AND INTERNAL CONTROL. THE EPPO STARTED WORK ON 1 JUNE 2021. THE REGULATION ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE ENTERED INTO FORCE ON 20 NOVEMBER 2017. YEAR, AND CURRENTLY 22-MEMBER STATES ARE PARTICIPATING. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO SHOW THE OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY AND CONDUCTED INVESTIGATIONS OF THE EPPO FOR THE TERRITORY OF THE MEMBER STATES, AND FOR THE TERRITORY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, THROUGH INDICATORS OF REPORTS RECEIVED, INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED, DAMAGE CAUSED, ASSETS SEIZED, AREAS WHERE COMMIT FRAUDS, I.E. DETERMINE A CERTAIN TYPOLOGY AND MODES THAT ARE USED IN FRAUDS TAN. TO OBTAIN THE RESULTS, THE METHOD OF CONTENT ANALYSIS AND RELATED STATISTICAL METHOD WAS USED, WHICH ANALYZED SEVERAL GROUPS OF INDICATORS, FOLLOWED BY THE METHOD OF COMPILATION AND CLASSIFICATION, WHICH CLASSIFIED THE ANALYZED CONTENT INTO GROUPS. THE OBTAINED RESEARCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF ITS WORK, THE EPPO HAS RECEIVED 2,832 REPORTS/COMPLAINTS REGARDING FRAUD WITH EU MONEY AND OPENED 576 INVESTIGATIONS, IN WHICH THE TOTAL DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED AT 5.4 BILLION EUROS, OF WHICH NINE INVESTIGATIONS WERE OPENED IN CROATIA. WITH AN ESTIMATED DAMAGE OF 30 MILLION EUROS. THE LARGEST NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS WAS OPENED IN ITALY, 120, AND IN BULGARIA, 103. OBSERVING THE TYPOLOGY OF PUNISHABLE ACTS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MOST NUMEROUS WERE FRAUDS RELATED TO COSTS NOT RELATED TO PROCUREMENT, OF WHICH 313 WERE DETERMINED. THE ESTIMATED DAMAGE IN NINE FRAUDS IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AMOUNTS TO EUR 30.6 MILLION, AND THE FRAUDS ARE UNFORTUNATELY CHARACTERIZED BY THE INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL, BUT ALSO HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AS A RULE, IN THE COURSE OF THIS BODY'S ACTIONS, CRIMINAL OFFENSES ARE RECORDED IN BANKRUPTCY, MOST OFTEN SUBSIDY FRAUD, FORGERY OF DOCUMENTS, ABUSE OF POSITION AND AUTHORITY, RECEIVING AND GIVING BRIBES. IN CONCLUSION, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS BODY CAN BE FULLY JUSTIFIED, BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO A LARGE NUMBER OF OPEN INVESTIGATIONS, THE EPPO HAS CONFIRMED ITS WORK WITH SUCCESSFULLY FILED INDICTMENTS AND FIRST VERDICTS AGAINST THE PERPETRATORS, AS WELL AS CONFISCATED PROPERTY BENEFITS.
311	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO COMPARE THE PROCEDURE OF PROCEEDINGS IN COURTS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN. BASED ON THE IDENTIFIED COMMON AND DIFFERENT FEATURES, THE POSSIBILITY OF MUTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE FUNCTIONING OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE TWO COUNTRIES IS CONSIDERED. THE MAIN METHODS THE AUTHORS USED WERE DIALECTICAL, HISTORICAL, AND SYSTEMATIC ONES, ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, AS WELL AS THE SPECIAL LEGAL METHODS OF COGNITION. THE RESULT OF THE STUDY IS THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF EXISTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THESE LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN, AS WELL AS THE SEARCH FOR WAYS TO SOLVE THEM THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE. IN THE GLOBAL LEGAL SPACE AT THE MOMENT BOTH THE CLASSICAL MODEL OF THE JURY TRIAL AND THE LAY JUDGE TRIAL EXIST. MOREOVER, EACH COUNTRY HAS CHOSEN FOR ITSELF THE MODEL OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY THE COURT WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE, WHICH MOST CLOSELY CORRESPONDS TO THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LEGAL, MORAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WITHIN THE STATE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL THE PROCEDURE OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS IN ORDER TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND ITS STRUCTURAL FEATURES AND AVOID EXCESSIVE DISCRETION ON THE PART OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT SUCH A LEGAL INSTITUTION IS BASED NOT ONLY ON LEGAL, BUT ALSO ON MORAL FOUNDATIONS THAT ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FUNCTIONING. RUSSIA USES A CLASSICAL MODEL OF A JURY TRIAL, INVOLVING A SEPARATE MEETING OF TWO BOARDS. THE DISADVANTAGES OF THIS MODEL ARE THE HIGH RISK THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF NON-PROFESSIONAL JUDGES WILL BE MADE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCLUSIVELY MOMENTARY EMOTIONS, SO THE WHOLE PROCEDURE IS AIMED AT OBJECTIFYING THE TRIAL. KAZAKHSTAN USES A MODEL CLOSER TO THE LAY JUDGE TRIAL. ITS MAIN DISADVANTAGE IS THE INABILITY TO ASSESS AND CONTROL THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE OF A PROFESSIONAL JUDGE ON CITIZENS WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD. IN THIS REGARD, IT IS WORTH PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JURORS TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY. BOTH MODELS, IN ADDITION TO DISADVANTAGES, CONTAIN POSITIVE FEATURES THAT CANNOT BE DENIED. MOREOVER, THE EXISTENCE OF COURTS WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PEOPLE CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASING THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN JUSTICE, AS WELL AS FORMING A RULE OF LAW STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY. IN THIS REGARD, LEVELING THE EXISTING SHORTCOMINGS AND STRENGTHENING THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THESE COURTS ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF EXPERIENCE AND THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE CURRENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA.
312	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE LESSONS THAT THE STATE AND SOCIETY COULD LEARN FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTRADICTIONS AND VIOLENT CONFLICTS THAT WERE OVERCOME IN RUSSIA IN THE 1990S. ETHNIC MOBILIZATION AND WAYS OF GETTING OUT OF CONFLICT SITUATIONS ARE ANALYSED. BASED ON SPECIFIC MATERIALS, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON WAS THE ABILITY TO FIND COMPROMISE, DIALOGUE WAYS TO REMOVE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE FIELD OF LANGUAGE, ECOLOGY, REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE USE OF LOCAL NATURAL RESOURCES, INCREASING INDEPENDENCE IN THE ECONOMY, AND DEVELOPING CULTURE. MOST OF THE CONTROVERSY WAS RELATED TO THE INSTITUTIONAL SPHERE, VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND FEDERAL LAWS. THE AUTHOR SHOWS THAT THE REGULATION OF SUCH CONFLICTS IN MULTI-COMPONENT FEDERATIONS IS FACILITATED BY THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ETHNIC NATIONALISM OF ELITES IN THE REPUBLICS IS DIFFERENT. ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE DISCOURSE AND LEGISLATIVE PRACTICE OF BASHKORTOSTAN, NORTH OSSETIA-ALANIA, TATARSTAN AND TUVE, IT IS SHOWN THAT DIVIDED SOVEREIGNTY (NOT SECESSION) WAS DISCUSSED IN TATARSTAN, BUT IN IT, AS IN SAKHA AND BASHKORTOSTAN, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL NATIONALISM, DEFENSIVE IN NORTH OSSETIA ALANIA, MAINLY CULTURAL IN TUVE. ACCORDINGLY, THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLICS DIFFERED. COMPROMISE SOLUTIONS WERE TEMPORARY AND AS SOON AS A STRONG LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT WAS FORMED IN THE CENTRE, THEY CEASED TO OPERATE, THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE LESSONS OF THE 1990S. INTERETHNIC CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE REPUBLICS WERE ALSO ACHIEVED BY COMPROMISE SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM OF ENSURING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LABOUR AND POLITICAL SPHERES STILL REMAINS. THE LESSON IN PREVENTING THE ESCALATION OF POWER CONFLICTS WAS THE RECOGNITION OF THE LEGITIMATE MONOPOLY OF POWER ON THE PART OF THE STATE. THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY IS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, BUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW NEEDS CONTROL FROM BOTH THE STATE AND SOCIETY. THE FINAL PART OF THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE REGULATION OF INTERETHNIC RELATIONS IN THE SECOND DECADE OF THE 2000S. THE AUTHOR SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF CALLING THIS PROCESS THE MANAGEMENT OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY, SINCE THE TERM NATION-BUILDING USED EARLIER CONTAINS A,DOUBLE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATION, BOTH ETHNOCULTURAL AND CIVIL. THE CITED RESEARCH RESULTS IN THE COUNTRY AND THE REPUBLICS SHOW THAT ETHNIC IDENTITY REMAINS VERY STABLE. BUT NOWHERE DOES IT APPEAR AS A CONFRONTATIONAL ALL-RUSSIAN IDENTITY, BUT IS COMBINED WITH IT AMONG THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION. IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THE IDEA OF THE PEOPLE AS CO-CITIZENSHIP, AIMED AT CONSOLIDATING SOCIAL, SPATIAL AND ETHNOCULTURAL COMMUNITIES, REALIZING THEIR INTERESTS IN THE ECONOMY, POLITICS, CULTURE, CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROVISION OF SOLIDARITY IN THE COUNTRY.
313	DURING HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DESCRIBED THE ROLE OF A JUDGE AS THAT OF AN UMPIRE, AND HE INSISTED THAT "[N]OBODY EVER COMES TO A BALL GAME TO SEE THE UMPIRE." THESE DAYS, THOUGH, ALL EYES ARE ON THE CHIEF JUSTICE. HE APPEARS TO HAVE BECOME THE SWING VOTE ON THE COURT, AND HIS APPROACH TO OVERRULING PRIOR DECISIONS MAY DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF ROE V. WADE. THE PRINCIPLE OF STARE DECISIS REQUIRES THE COURT TO ADHERE TO ITS EARLIER RULINGS-EVEN THOSE IT CONSIDERS WRONGLY DECIDED-ABSENT A "SPECIAL JUSTIFICATION." IN FRANCHISE TAX BOARD V. HYATT AND KNICK V. TOWNSHIP OF SCOTT, BOTH DECIDED 5-4 IN THE WANING DAYS OF THE COURT'S OCTOBER 2018 TERM, CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS AND THE OTHER CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE COURT FOUND SUCH A JUSTIFICATION AND OVER-RULED DECISIONS DATING BACK TO 1979 AND 1985. JUSTICES BREYER AND KAGAN SUGGESTED THAT HYATT AND KNICK SPELL A BAD OMEN FOR OTHER PRECEDENTS. BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE SO QUICK TO PROCLAIM THAT THE SKY IS FALLING FOR, ON THE BASIS OF STARE DECISIS ALONE, THE CHIEF JUSTICE SIDED WITH THE COURT'S FOUR PROGRESSIVES IN KISOR V. WILKIE, A 5-4 DECISION OF THE SAME VINTAGE AS HYATT AND KNICK IN WHICH THE COURT REFUSED TO OVERRULE 1945 AND 1997 PRECEDENTS, AND HE JOINED JUSTICES ALITO AND KAGAN IN DISSENTING FROM THE FRACTURED COURT'S 2020 DECISION IN RAMOS V. LOUISIANA TO OVERTURN A RULING HANDED DOWN THE YEAR BEFORE ROE. THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S VOTES IN KISOR AND RAMOS SUGGEST A COMMITMENT TO STARE DECISIS AT LEAST TO A DEGREE AND THAT HE WILL GIVE SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION TO THE PRINCIPLE'S DEMANDS IF THE COURT IS ASKED TO OVERRULE ROE. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S APPROACH TO STARE DECISIS BY EXAMINING WHAT HE HIMSELF HAS WRITTEN AND WHERE HE OTHERWISE HAS STOOD IN DECISIONS IN WHICH STARE DECISIS HAS FEATURED PROMINENTLY. WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO PREDICT WHETHER THE CHIEF JUSTICE ULTIMATELY WOULD VOTE IN FAVOR OF OVERRULING ROE, THE ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT CONSIDERATIONS THAT COULD PUSH HIM IN THAT DIRECTION, THEREBY OFFERING GUIDANCE TO LITIGANTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE. AND THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS'S DEVOTION TO JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD LEAD HIM TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF OVER-RULING ROE ONLY IF A CHALLENGED ABORTION REGULATION CANNOT BE UPHELD ON NARROWER GROUNDS AND REAFFIRMING THE LANDMARK 1973 DECISION WILL CAUSE MORE HARM TO THE CONSTITUTION THAN CASTING THE ABORTION QUESTION OUT OF THE COURTS AND BACK TO THE STATES.
314	BY GLOBAL STANDARDS, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IS UNUSUAL IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS, BUT ONE OF ITS MOST DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS IS ITS RELUCTANCE TO ENGAGE IN COMPARATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS. MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ON THE NORMATIVE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND IN WHAT WAYS THE COURT OUGHT TO MAKE USE OF FOREIGN CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. RARELY, HOWEVER, DO SCHOLARS BROACH THE UNDERLYING EMPIRICAL QUESTION OF WHY SOME COURTS MAKE GREATER USE OF FOREIGN LAW THAN OTHERS. TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF COMPARATIVISM, A BEHIND-THE-SCENES INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED OF FOUR LEADING COURTS IN EAST ASIA: THE JAPANESE SUPREME COURT, THE KOREAN,CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THE TAIWANESE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, AND THE HONG KONG COURT OF FINAL APPEAL. THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION HIGHLIGHT THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS IN SHAPING JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO POSE AN UNEXPECTED CHALLENGE TO TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. EVIDENCE FROM INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH NUMEROUS JUSTICES, CLERKS, AND SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS SUGGESTS THAT A COMBINATION OF MUTUALLY REINFORCING FACTORS CREATES THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR COMPARATIVISM TO THRIVE. THE FIRST FACTOR IS INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. A COURT THAT LACKS INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR LEARNING ABOUT FOREIGN LAW, SUCH AS THE RECRUITMENT OF LAW CLERKS WITH FOREIGN LEGAL EXPERTISE OR THE USE OF RESEARCHERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN FOREIGN LAW, IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE MORE THAN SPORADIC USE OF FOREIGN LAW. THE SECOND FACTOR IS LEGAL EDUCATION. EVEN THE MOST ELABORATE OF INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR FACILITATING COMPARATIVISM IS UNLIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE UNLESS IT IS BACKED BY A SYSTEM OF LEGAL EDUCATION THAT PRODUCES AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF LAWYERS WITH BOTH AN APTITUDE AND APPETITE FOR COMPARATIVISM. INVESTIGATION OF THE REASONS FOR WHICH COURTS ENGAGE IN COMPARATIVISM ALSO REVEALS A HIDDEN UNDERLYING PHENOMENON OF JUDICIAL DIPLOMACY. UNLIKE OTHER JUDICIAL PRACTICES SUCH AS TEXTUALISM OR ORIGINALISM, COMPARATIVISM IS NOT MERELY A MEANS BY WHICH JUDGES PERFORM LEGAL AND ADJUDICATIVE FUNCTIONS; IT CAN ALSO BE A FORM OF DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY. WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS DEMONSTRATE MASTERY OF FOREIGN LAW OR HOST FOREIGN JUDGES, THEIR GOALS MAY NOT CONSIST EXCLUSIVELY, OR EVEN PRIMARILY, OF WRITING STRONGER OPINIONS OR WINNING OVER DOMESTIC AUDIENCES. THEY MAY ALSO BE COMPETING WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE OR PURSUING FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE CONCEPT OF JUDICIAL DIPLOMACY HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHY CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS ENGAGE IN A NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT ARE ONLY TENUOUSLY RELATED TO THE ACT OF ADJUDICATION. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. SUPREME COURT RARELY PRACTICES CONSTITUTIONAL COMPARATIVISM, IT IS AN ACTIVE PRACTITIONER OF JUDICIAL DIPLOMACY IN OTHER FORMS.
315	THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THAT RETURNING CRIMINAL CASES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PART. 4 ART. 302 OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (RF CPC), THE "GUILTY" VERDICT CANNOT BE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS; IT IS DELIVERED ONLY IF DURING THE TRIAL THE DEFENDANT'S GUILT IN COMMITTING AN OFFENSE IS ESTABLISHED BY THE EVIDENCE THE COURT HAS EXAMINED. HOWEVER, NOT EVERY CRIMINAL CASE PROVIDES SOLID ADEQUATE EVIDENCE, SUFFICIENT FOR AN UNAMBIGUOUS CONCLUSION, TO THE COURT. THE SITUATION IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE RF CPC, UNLIKE THE RSFSR CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF 1960, ALLOWS THE JUDGE NEITHER TO RETURN CRIMINAL CASES THAT WERE POORLY INVESTIGATED TO THE PROSECUTOR, NOR TO MAKE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS PARTICIPANTS WORK. IT IS ALSO KNOWN THAT IN 2009 THE LEGISLATOR DEPRIVED PROSECUTORS OF MOST OF THEIR POWERS TO SUPERVISE INVESTIGATION BODIES, WHICH FURTHER REDUCED THE QUALITY OF THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AND THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENTIARY MATERIAL. AS A RESULT, TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE, THE COURT IS FORCED TO MAKE EXPERT STUDIES, ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS, SOMETIMES COLLECTING MORE EVIDENCE THAN A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION BODY, PERFORMING THE FUNCTION IT DOES. UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IT APPEARS THAT RETURNING CRIMINAL CASES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED, AND IT WILL NOT BE A SIGN OF PROSECUTORIAL BIAS. THE AUTHOR STATES THAT SOCIETY AND THE STATE GROW MORE STABLE WHEN THE TASKS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE ARE SOLVED. THE TASKS INVOLVE THE PUNISHMENT OF THE GUILTY, THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE INNOCENT, THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS, THE RESTORATION OF VIOLATED RIGHTS, ETC. IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE "GUILTY" AND "EXCULPATORY" EVIDENCE IN ITS PURE FORM RATHER THAN IN THEORY BEFORE ASSESSING THE WHOLE BULK OF IT; ONE FACT, DEPENDING ON ITS CONNECTION WITH OTHER EVIDENCE, CAN BOTH CONVICT AND ACQUIT THE DEFENDANT. IN CASE OF A LACK OF EVIDENCE OR IN THE PRESENCE OF LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE IT IS FAR MORE PREFERABLE TO REQUIRE AN INVESTIGATION BODY TO FINISH ITS WORK ACCORDING TO THE NORMS OF THE CURRENT RF CPC RATHER THAN TO MAKE A CONTROVERSIAL PROCEDURAL DECISION THAT CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS TODAY. RUSSIAN JUDGES' CONSCIENCE AND DECENCY SHOULD NOT BE DENIED, AND THE COURT'S TASK IS TO DELIVER A FAIR AND REASONED VERDICT THAT CAN BE MADE ONLY AFTER EXAMINING SUFFICIENT ADEQUATE EVIDENCE. A HIERARCHICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM WILL ALLOW TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE VALIDITY OF DECISIONS ON RETURNING CRIMINAL CASES FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.
316	IN ORDER TO PREDICT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN POLITICAL PRACTICES, THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE IDEAS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN IN SOME REGIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN SIBERIA ON THE FUNCTIONS AND STRUCTURE OF THE POLITICAL FIELD, ASSESSES THEIR CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. ANTHONY GIDDENS'S THEORY OF STRUCTURATION OF POLITICAL ACTION AND PIERRE BOURDIEU'S FIELD THEORY BECAME THE METHODOLOGY OF THE RESEARCH. THE EMPIRICAL BASIS OF THE ARTICLE RESTS ON THE DATA OF MASS SURVEYS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN OF GRADES 7 TO 11 OF RUSSIAN (ALTAI KRAI, KEMEROVO AND NOVOSIBIRSK OBLASTS, ALTAI REPUBLIC) AND KAZAKHSTAN (PAVLODAR AND EAST KAZAKHSTAN) REGIONS. THEIR CROSS-TERRITORIAL COMPARISON MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF UNIVERSALIZATION OF IMAGES OF POLITICAL FIELDS, AS WELL AS POSITIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEM IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALIZATION AND THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. TO REACH THEIR OBJECTIVES, THE AUTHORS ANALYZED THE LEVEL AND STRUCTURE OF SCHOOLCHILDREN'S INTEREST IN POLITICS, THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAIN POLITICAL EVENTS AND PERSONALITIES, IDEAS ABOUT THE ROLE AND CONFIGURATION OF THE POLITICAL FIELD, THE EXISTING EXPERIENCE OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION AND ATTITUDES TO ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL PRACTICES. THE STUDY REVEALED A HIGH LEVEL OF SCHOOLCHILDREN'S INTEREST IN THE POLITICAL SPHERE. HOWEVER, THE SITUATIONAL CHARACTER OF OBTAINING POLITICAL INFORMATION MAINLY FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS AND NEWS FEEDS OF INTERNET RESOURCES LEADS TO A LACK OF A SYSTEMATIC VIEW ON THE POLITICAL SPHERE AND A FRAGMENTED CHARACTER OF INFORMATION ABOUT IT. INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE POWER PREVAILS IN SCHOOLCHILDREN'S KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POLITICAL LEADERS, SINCE THE MEDIA MOSTLY COVER THIS POWER'S ACTIVITIES, AND THE SOCIETY IS CONVINCED IN ITS LEADING ROLE IN THE RUSSIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM. BESIDES, SCHOOLCHILDREN KNOW ONLY POLITICAL EVENTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED A WIDE RESPONSE ON THE INTERNET. MODERN SCHOOLCHILDREN GET INVOLVED IN NETWORKING RATHER EARLY THUS EXPANDING THE RANGE OF POLITICAL PRACTICES AVAILABLE TO THEM. THEIR ONLINE ACTIVITY PREDOMINATES OVER OFFLINE ACTIVITY. THIS SITUATION IS TRANSLATED INTO SCHOOLCHILDREN'S POLITICAL ATTITUDES. MOST OF THEM ARE DISPOSED TO IMPLEMENT NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED FORMS OF POLITICAL PRACTICES AND FORMS OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY THAT ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT IN SOLVING SOCIAL PROBLEMS. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT PRACTICES OF THE POLITICAL FIELD AND THE HABITUS OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIETY, SCHOOLCHILDREN CONSIDER REGULATORY AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS TO BE THE MAIN ONES. THEY SEE THE STATE AS THE DOMINANT AGENT OF POLITICS WHICH MUST ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND CONDITIONS FOR THE REALIZATION OF POLITICAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS. THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN HAS REVEALED THE IDENTITY OF THE OBSERVED TRENDS WHICH OVERLAP FOR BOTH COUNTRIES.
317	THIS PAPER IS A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON HOLOCAUST PERPETRATORS. AFTER A BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE NAZI PHENOMENON IN CONTEXT, THREE CASES OF THEIR PROTAGONISTS ARE ANALYZED: RUDOLF HOSS, JURGEN STROOP AND FRANZ STANGL; COMMANDER OF THE AUSCHWITZ DEATH CAMP, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIQUIDATION OF THE WARSAW GHETTO AND THE COMMANDER OF THE TREBLINKA DEATH CAMP RESPECTIVELY. THE HOSS CASE IS STUDIED TAKING AS A SOURCE HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WHILE THE REMAINING TWO FROM INTERVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS OF KAZIMIERZ MOCZARSKI AND GITTA SERENY. HOESS, STANGL AND STROOP WERE CONVICTED FOR THE DEATHS OF 1,100,000, BETWEEN 750.00 AND 900.00 AND 350,000 PEOPLE RESPECTIVELY. IN THIS SENSE A PREMISE OF THIS WORK IS THAT NONE OF THEM CAN BE CONSIDERED ORDINARY MAN OR ORDINARY PERSON; ON THE CONTRARY FOLLOWING RAUL HILBERG THEY ARE IDENTIFIED AS FULLY IMPREGNATED WITH THE SUBJECT WORLDVIEW AND IDEOLOGY OF NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND SS FROM A FRAME OF REFERENCE PRIOR AGGRESSIVE AND VIOLENT WERE EVENTUALLY BECOMING MASS MURDERERS. AS GUSTAVO COSACOV HOLDS THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD OWN A " MALIGNANT OR INVERTED HOLINESS " THAT HAD REPLACED HIS CHRISTIAN - WESTERN ETHICAL AND MORAL VALUES; ALLOWING THEM TO SYSTEMATICALLY COMMIT CRIMES. ALTHOUGH THE ISSUE OF THE PERPETRATORS HAS BEEN LESS ADDRESSED THAN VICTIMS, IN THE HISTORIOGRAPHICAL FIELD THERE ARE STRONG CONTRIBUTIONS. SUFFICE APPOINT CHRISTOPHER BROWNING, PETER LONGERICH OR RAUL HILBERG TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT RESEARCH TO WHICH THIS TEXT RECOGNIZES AND ASPIRES. IN THIS SENSE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE FOLLOWING PAGES FIRST IS TO DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN SOME OF THE HISTORICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT PRODUCE PERPETRATORS OF SERIAL MURDERS OF PEOPLE AS FAR APART AS UNKNOWN; AS WELL AS DECIPHER THEIR FRAME OF REFERENCE. FOR THIS A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL SOURCES IN THE LIGHT OF MULTIPLE SOCIAL DISCIPLINES WILL BE DONE, ANALYZING HIS SPEECHES, HIS ARGUMENTS, TRYING TO DELINEATE THE WILLS AND MOTIVATIONS OF HOESS, STANGL AND STROOP. A KEY CONCEPT OF THIS RESEARCH IS " BUREAUCRACY " IN THE SENSE OF MAX WEBER. IN SECOND PLACE IT WILL REFLECT ON NAZI VIOLENCE, IN THE SENSE OF CONTRADICTORY AUTOTELIC VIOLENCE WITH RESPECT TO LIBERAL SOCIAL PARADIGM AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN BOTH CASES IT WILL BE PRIORITIZED TO RECREATE AND INTERPRET THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PERPETRATORS. LOOKING HISTORIOGRAPHICAL AMPLITUDE, CLASSICS AS WELL AS RECENT PUBLICATIONS ON THE SUBJECT WILL BE USED. IT IS NOT SEEKING TO OBTAIN CONCLUSIONS OR ABSOLUTE ANSWERS BUT TO REFLECT, RETHINK AND COMPOUND THE PROTAGONISTS OF PERHAPS THE DARKEST FACT OF HUMAN HISTORY.
318	THIS NOTE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY AND ANALYSIS OF LEGAL ISSUES OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS (CONVENTION) IN UKRAINE. THE RESEARCH STATES THAT THE CONVENTION IS ONE OF THE FIRST HUMAN RIGHTS DOCUMENTS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ENSURING OBJECTIVE STANDARDS AND PROVIDING PROTECTION TO INDIVIDUALS AGAINST ABUSE OF STATE POWER. THE NOTE PROVES THAT THE CONVENTION, WHICH IS INHERENTLY A NEW GENERATION TREATY, NOT ONLY ESTABLISHES RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS FOR STATES THAT ARE TRADITIONAL FOR SOURCES OF CLASSICAL INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT ALSO ENSHRINES THE OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBER STATES TO ITS CITIZENS, INDIVIDUALS, AND LEGAL ENTITIES - ALL THOSE UNDER ITS JURISDICTION. THE RESEARCH STIPULATES THAT WITH ITS ACCESSION TO THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN 1995, UKRAINE NOT ONLY SHOWED ITS RECOGNITION OF THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO UNDERTOOK THE COMMITMENTS TO ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, THEREBY CONFIRMING ITS EUROPEAN DEMOCRATIC CHOICE. IN 1997, WITH THE RATIFICATION OF THE CONVENTION, A NEW STAGE BEGAN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS IN UKRAINE. THE NOTE STATES THAT UKRAINE TAKES THIRD PLACE AMONG THE 47 MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF APPEALS TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. A NEGATIVE TENDENCY TO INCREASE THE SUBMISSION OF COMPLAINTS BY CITIZENS OF UKRAINE TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS INTENSIFYING EVERY YEAR. THIS INDICATES THAT NOWADAYS, THE NEED TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM COMPLIANCE OF UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION WITH EUROPEAN STANDARDS IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE PREVENTION OF THEIR VIOLATIONS REMAINS URGENT. THE NOTE CONCLUDES THAT AT THE PRESENT STAGE, AMONG THE MOST PROBLEMATIC ISSUES OF UKRAINE'S COOPERATION WITH THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IS THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY - IN PARTICULAR, BRINGING IT IN LINE WITH EUROPEAN NORMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COUNCILS OF EUROPE INSTITUTIONS, STRENGTHENING THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, ETC. THE AUTHORS OFFER A SET OF PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE NECESSITY OF ACHIEVING MAXIMUM COMPLIANCE OF UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION WITH THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND PREVENTION OF THEIR VIOLATIONS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF APPEALS OF UKRAINIAN CITIZENS TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RESEARCH EMPHASISES THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DEMOCRATIC LEGAL STATE AND UKRAINE'S ACCESSION INTO THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION SHOULD EXIST IN REALITY, AS WELL AS BE SUPPORTED BY THE RELEVANT INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POLICY OF THE COUNTRY IN REGARD TO HUMAN RIGHTS, THE HARMONISED SYSTEM OF LEGISLATIVE ACTS, AND THE REAL MECHANISMS OF GUARANTEES OF FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS.
319	THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCH IS SOCIAL RELATIONS IN THE FIELD OF LEGITIMACY OF POSITIVE LAW IN THE MODERN STATE. METHODOLOGY. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY IS THE METHODS OF INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION, DIALECTICAL-MATERIALISTIC METHOD, METHOD OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS, HISTORICAL METHOD, WHICH ALLOWED TO OBJECTIVELY COMPREHEND THE CONTENT AND ESSENCE OF THE ISSUES UNDER STUDY. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS A THEORETICAL AND LEGAL STUDY OF THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW AS ITS JUSTIFICATION AND RECOGNITION. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY ARE: THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE THEORY OF COMMUNICATIVE RATIONALITY IS INVESTIGATED; THE HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SUBJECTS AND THE PROCESS OF RECOGNITION, LEGITIMATION OF NORMS IN SOCIETY AS A SOCIAL EVOLUTION IS INVESTIGATED; THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEAS OF LEGITIMACY AND MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE MODERN LEGAL ORDER IS INVESTIGATED; THE TENDENCIES OF LEGITIMIZATION OF POSITIVE LAW IN THE MODERN STATE ON THE BASIS OF MORALITY ARE DETERMINED; THE PECULIARITIES OF ENSURING THE LEGITIMACY OF POWER THROUGH THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW ARE HIGHLIGHTED. CONCLUSIONS. LAW AND MODERN MORALITY STEM FROM TRADITIONAL RELATIONS, AND THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED. LEGAL NORMS ARE NOT JUST ORDERS, THEY ARE FULFILLED NOT ONLY OUT OF FEAR OF COERCION, BUT ALSO OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE LAW. HOWEVER, FOR THIS, THE LEGAL ORDER MUST BE LEGITIMATE, ENJOY THE AUTHORITY OF CITIZENS, AND THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF THE POSITIVE LAW DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE MORAL NORMS SHARED BY A GIVEN SOCIETY. THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW LIES, FIRST OF ALL, IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGAL BASIS OF STATE AND SOCIAL LIFE. BUT THE MEANING OF THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW IN A SOCIETY THAT CALLS ITSELF DEMOCRATIC IS SEEN NOT IN THE MERE FACT OF EXISTENCE AND STRICT IMPLEMENTATION OF EVEN LEGALLY PERFECT LEGISLATION, BUT IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT COMPREHENSIVELY EMBODIES UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED HUMANISTIC GOALS, IDEALS, AND VALUES. AMONG THEM ARE THE RECOGNITION OF THE PEOPLE AS THE EXCLUSIVE SOURCE OF POWER AND LAW, THE RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS, INADMISSIBILITY OF USURPATION AND UNLIMITED POWER, EQUALITY OF ALL BEFORE THE LAW AND THE COURT, INVIOLABILITY OF JUSTICE, ETC. OF COURSE, IT IS ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CONSOLIDATION OF THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE AND PROTECT THEM. THE LEGITIMACY OF LAW IS THE IDEA, REQUIREMENT AND SYSTEM OF REAL EXPRESSION OF LAW IN THE LAWS OF THE STATE, IN LAWMAKING ITSELF, IN SUBORDINATE LAWMAKING WITH THE STEADY RECOGNITION AND PERCEPTION BY THE POPULATION OF THE STATE.
320	CONTAINING THE ADVANCE OF DEFORESTATION IN BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING THE ROLES AND MOVEMENTS OF THE ACTORS INVOLVED. THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT ACTORS VARIES WIDELY AMONG LOCATIONS WITHIN THE REGION, AND ALSO EVOLVES AT ANY PARTICULAR SITE OVER THE COURSE OF FRONTIER ESTABLISHMENT AND CONSOLIDATION. LANDLESS MIGRANTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN CLEARING THE LAND THEY OCCUPY AND IN MOTIVATING LANDHOLDERS TO CLEAR AS A DEFENSE AGAINST INVASION OR EXPROPRIATION. COLONISTS IN OFFICIAL SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER SMALL FARMERS ALSO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF CLEARING, BUT RANCHERS CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE REGION'S CLEARING. THIS GROUP IS MOST RESPONSIVE TO MACROECONOMIC CHANGES AFFECTING SUCH FACTORS AS COMMODITY PRICES, AND ALSO RECEIVES SUBSTANTIAL SUBSIDIES. ULTERIOR MOTIVES, SUCH AS LAND SPECULATION AND MONEY LAUNDERING, ALSO AFFECT THIS GROUP. DRUG TRAFFICKING AND MONEY LAUNDERING REPRESENT STRONG FORCES IN SOME AREAS AND HELP SPREAD DEFORESTATION WHERE IT WOULD BE UNPROFITABLE BASED ONLY ON THE LEGITIMATE ECONOMY. GOLDMINERS INCREASE THE POPULATION IN DISTANT AREAS AND SUBSEQUENTLY ENTER THE RANKS OF OTHER GROUPS. WORK AS LABORERS OR DEBT SLAVES PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT ENTRY TO THE REGION FOR POOR MIGRANTS FROM NORTHEAST BRAZIL, PROVIDING CHEAP LABOR TO LARGE RANCHES AND A LARGE SOURCE OF ENTRANTS TO OTHER GROUPS, SUCH AS LANDLESS FARMERS AND COLONISTS. CAPITALIZED FARMERS, INCLUDING AGRIBUSINESS FOR SOY PRODUCTION, HAVE TREMENDOUS IMPACT IN CERTAIN AREAS, SUCH AS MATO GROSSO. THIS GROUP RESPONDS TO COMMODITY MARKETS AND PROVIDES JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. LANDGRABBERS, OR GRILEIROS, ARE IMPORTANT IN ENTERING PUBLIC LAND AND BEGINNING THE PROCESS OF DEFORESTATION AND TRANSFER OF LAND TO SUBSEQUENT GROUPS OF ACTORS. THESE INCLUDE SAWMILL OWNERS AND LOGGERS, WHO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GENERATING FUNDS FOR CLEARING BY OTHER GROUPS, RANGING FROM LANDLESS MIGRANTS TO LARGE RANCHERS. THEY ALSO BUILD ENDOGENOUS ROADS, FACILITATING THE ENTRY OF OTHER ACTORS. FUTURE MOVEMENTS OF ACTORS WILL BE INFLUENCED BY MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS, SUCH AS THOSE FOR HYDROELECTRIC DAMS. POLICIES FOR REDUCING DEFORESTATION MUST INCLUDE REMOVING MOTIVES FOR DEFORESTATION BY STOPPING THE PRACTICE OF REGULARIZING LAND CLAIMS AND BY CUTTING SUBSIDIES. THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE REGION BY COMPLETING THE CADASTER, OR REGISTER, OF LAND TITLES AND BY REINFORCING COMMAND AND CONTROL. MOVEMENT TO THE FRONTIER NEEDS TO BE DISCOURAGED BY EXERCISING RESTRAINT IN APPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS HIGHWAYS, AND BY CREATING AND PROTECTING CONSERVATION UNITS. ECONOMIC ALTERNATIVES TO DEFORESTATION SHOULD BE FOSTERED BY GENERATING EMPLOYMENT IN SOURCE AREAS AND IN ALTERNATIVE MIGRATION DESTINATIONS, BY SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE USES OF FOREST, BY SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE SUPPLY OF DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS TIMBER, AND BY REWARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES OF STANDING FOREST.
321	IT IS COMMONPLACE TO STATE THAT THE BORDERLINE COURTS ARE THE LAST OBSTACLE IN THE DEFENSE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW, THE DIVISION OF POWERS, AND HENCE, OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE JUDGMENTS OF LAST RESORT WHICH ARE VERY ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF ARGUMENTATIVE PRACTICES USED TO CONCEAL DECISIONS THAT MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY POLITICIZED, AND THEREFORE CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO FUNDAMENTAL ELECTORAL RIGHTS, TO THE CERTAINTY AND LEGALITY OF ELECTORAL ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS TO THE HOLDING OF FREE, AUTHENTIC, AND PERIODICAL ELECTIONS. THE PRACTICE OF USING THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE JUDI- CIAL FUNCTION TO INTENTIONALLY UNDERMINE THE CORE OF DEMOCRACY IS BARELY THEORIZED. HOWEVER, IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT IN THE FUTURE THESE TYPES OF ATTACK WILL BE PART OF THE AUTHORITARIAN TOOLS USED BY GROUPS OF AN ANTI-DEMOCRATIC NATURE. THAT IS TO SAY, THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE COURTS AND NOT THE POLITICAL ACTORS ARE THE ONES THAT IMPLEMENT UNDEMOCRATIC MEASURES WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF THE DIFFICULTY FOR ITS IDENTIFICATION, GIVEN THE TRADITIONAL ROLE ASSIGNED TO THE JUDICIARY IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL STATE OF LAW, MAKES IT ESSENTIAL TO REVIEW THE USE OF THE WEIGHTING OF THE ARGUMENTATIVE REPRESENTATION. THIS, IN ORDER TO PREVENT DEMOCRACY FROM BEING DAMAGED BY CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION AND TO AVOID THE TOLERANCE FOR THE ABSENCE OF A MINIMUM SOCIAL CONSENSUS ON THE ARGUMENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO SUSTAIN WITH RE-LATIVE TEMPORARY STABILITY. EVEN MORE SO, WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE WHO MAKE UP THE CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION SPECIALIZED IN ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRACY. IN MEXICO, THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY (TEPJF) IS THE HIGHEST ELECTORAL COURT. THIS BODY HAS ISSUED CONTROVERSIAL AND TRANSCENDENT DECISIONS FOR ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY WHICH CAN BE SUBJECT TO CRITICAL LEGAL ANALYSIS AS AN INPUT FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELATED TO ISSUES CONCERNING CITIZEN PARTICIPATION SUCH AS THE REVOCATION OF MANDATE AND THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS DUE TO ITS DIFFUSION BY PUBLIC SERVANTS, AS WELL AS CASES OF GENDER-BASED POLITICAL VIOLENCE (VPG, BY ITS ACRONYM IN SPANISH) AND THE DEPRIVATION OF AN HONEST WAY OF LIVING (MHV, BY ITS ACRONYM IN SPANISH) AS A SANCTION. ANOTHER TOPIC WORTH CONSIDERING IS THE RULINGS ON THE MODIFICATION OR DEFECTIVE ABANDON- MENT OF THE JURISPRUDENCE IN MATTERS SUCH AS THE ASSUMPTION OF COMPETENCE OVER PARLIAMENTARY ACTS IN THE INTEGRATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE OR GOVERNMENT BODIES BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNION, AND THE MESSAGES OF THE LEGISLATORS, WHICH ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF PARLIAMENTARY IMMUNITY, AS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.
322	THE ANTICIPATED APPLICATION OF LEGAL NORMS WHICH ARE NOT YET IN FORCE AND THE RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CASE LAW RECEIVE INCREASING ATTENTION IN RECENT GERMAN LEGAL DISCOURSE. BOTH PHENOMENA POSE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A SOLUTION THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE NORMATIVELY APPROPRIATE FOR THE FUTURE CAN BE APPLIED TO PAST FACTS ALREADY. THIS CONCERN HAS TO BE BALANCED WITH ASPECTS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE PROTECTION OF LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE MAY MILITATE AGAINST THE ANTICIPATED APPLICATION OF LEGAL NORMS AND, RECIPROCALLY, IN FAVOR OF A RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CASE LAW. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, ANTICIPATED APPLICATION AND RETROACTIVE EFFECT SEEM TO BE DEFENSIBLE, IF THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL NORM OR THE NEW LINE OF CASE LAW DO NOT, BY THEMSELVES, CHANGE THE PERTINENT NORMATIVE ASSESSMENT, BUT MERELY TRACE A FACTUAL OR NORMATIVE CHANGE THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE IN SOCIETY. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE PROBLEM OF ANTICIPATED APPLICATION AND OF RETROACTIVE EFFECT MAY BE APPROACHED BY IDENTICAL DOCTRINAL MEANS. A SO CALLED SUBSTANTIVE LAW APPROACH (SACHRECHTLICHE LOSUNG) ADDRESSES THE ANTICIPATED APPLICATION AND THE PROTECTION AGAINST RETROACTIVE EFFECT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF SUBSTANTIVE PRIVATE LAW. THIS APPROACH ACCORDS WELL WITH THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE GERMAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND IS THEREFORE APPLIED RATHER FREQUENTLY. IN CONTRAST, THE SO CALLED CONFLICT OF LAWS APPROACH (INTERTEMPORALRECHTLICHE LOSUNG) COMPRISES A SELF-CONTAINED ANTICIPATED APPLICATION OF LEGAL NORMS WHICH ARE NOT YET IN FORCE OR A SELF-CONTAINED PROTECTION AGAINST RETROACTIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CASE LAW. THIS APPROACH IS AT ODDS WITH THE ORTHODOX VIEW OF THE JUDICIARY IN GERMANY AND, THEREFORE, IS PRACTICED ONLY CAUTIOUSLY. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE COMMON PRINCIPLES, THE CURRENT DOCTRINE OF RETROACTIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CASE LAW DOES NOT SEEM TO BE FULLY CONVINCING. IT RESTS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A RETROACTIVE EFFECT IS TYPICALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE THE COURTS DO MERELY ARTICULATE THE BEST PICTURE OF THE LAW BASED ON ARGUMENTS AND PRINCIPLES. HOWEVER, PRIVATE LAW IS DEPLOYED TO AN INCREASING EXTENT TO SHAPE SOCIETY AND THE COURTS ASSUME AN ACTIVE PART IN THIS TRANSFORMATIVE PROCESS. IN THAT COURSE, THE IDEA OF A MERE IMPROVED LEGAL JUDGMENT IS THREATENED TO BECOME A FICTION. THEREFORE, THE GERMAN FEDERAL SUPREME COURT SHOULD BE MORE ATTENTIVE TO THE RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT TO FAR-REACHING CHANGES IN CASE LAW. THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED, PRIMARILY, BY A STRENGTHENED JUDICIAL SELF-RESTRAINT, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO CHANGES IN CASE LAW. IF THIS SOLUTION IS DISCARDED AS UNREALISTIC, ONE SHOULD, ALTERNATIVELY, CONSIDER A BETTER PROTECTION AGAINST RETROACTIVE EFFECTS WHICH COULD BE ACHIEVED, INTER ALIA, BY THE MEANS OF PROSPECTIVE OVERRULING.
323	THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS A PLURALISTIC ACCOUNT OF SUBSTANTIVE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW (ICL). CHALLENGING THE DOMINANT ASSUMPTION AMONG THEORISTS AND PRACTITIONERS, IT ARGUES THAT THE SEARCH FOR CONSISTENCY AND UNIFORMITY IN ICL IS MISGUIDED, THAT THE LAW APPLICABLE TO INTERNATIONAL CRIMES SHOULD NOT BE THE SAME IN ALL CASES, AND THAT THOSE GUILTY OF LIKE CRIMES SHOULD NOT ALWAYS RECEIVE LIKE SENTENCES. IN LIEU OF A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL CRIMINAL LAW, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A FOUR-TIERED MODEL OF ICL THAT TAKES SERIOUSLY THE NATIONAL LAWS OF THE STATE OR STATES THAT, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ASSERT JURISDICTION OVER A CASE. AFTER BRIEFLY SURVEYING HISTORICAL COMPLEXITIES CONCERNING THE DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF ICL, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON STANDARD JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF ICL. IT LOOKS IN PARTICULAR TO JUSTIFICATIONS ROOTED IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, GRAVITY CONSIDERATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS. WHILE EACH ACCOUNT PROVIDES POWERFUL REASONS FOR SEEKING UNIFORMITY WITH RESPECT TO SOME COMPONENTS OF ICL, NEITHER IN ISOLATION NOR IN COMBINATION DO THESE RATIONALES DEMAND UNIFORMITY WITH RESPECT TO THE ENTIRE CONTENT OF ICL. IN PARTICULAR, THESE STANDARD THEORIES HAVE DIFFICULTY EXPLAINING WHY ICL SHOULD SEEK TO MONOPOLIZE THOSE ASPECTS OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT SPEAK MORE TO THE GENERAL NATURE OF CRIMINALITY THAN TO ANY SPECIFIC GOAL OF ICL. A REVIEW OF GENERAL RULE-OF-LAW VALUES-INCLUDING THE VALUES OF CONSISTENCY, LEGALITY, ADMINISTRATION, NORMATIVE DEVELOPMENT, AND AVOIDING JURISDICTIONAL CHAOS-YIELDS SIMILAR RESULTS, AFFIRMING THAT CONTINGENT DOMESTIC LAW HAS A VITAL ROLE TO PLAY IN ICL PROSECUTIONS. THE ARTICLE NEXT UNDERTAKES A CASE STUDY OF THE ERDEMOVIE DECISION, IN WHICH THE APPEALS CHAMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) ANNOUNCED A NEW RULE OF ICL REJECTING DURESS AS A COMPLETE DEFENSE TO MURDER. A CLOSE READING OF THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING REVEALS THAT THE ICTY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO APPLY BOSNIAN LAW CONSIDERING THE COURT'S INABILITY TO ARTICULATE WHY THE SPECIAL CONTEXT OR PURPOSE OF ICL REQUIRES A SPECIFIC RESULT, THE NORMATIVE SHORTCOMINGS OF BOTH THE MAJORITY AND DISSENT'S POSITIONS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A SUITABLE APPROACH UNDER DOMESTIC LAW THE ARTICLE THEN ELABORATES UPON THIS ANALYSIS TO SET FORTH A FOUR-TIERED MODEL OF SUBSTANTIVE ICL COMPRISING: (1) TRULY UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES OF ICL, (2) TRIBUNAL-SPECIFIC RULES, (3) RULES CONSTRAINING THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF DOMESTIC DISCRETION, AND (4) DEFAULT RULES. WHILE THIS MODEL HAS POWERFUL NORMATIVE FORCE, IT ALSO PROVIDES A COHERENT AND SUPERIOR FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF ICL IN ITS CURRENT STATE OF DEVELOPMENT.
324	BASED ON THE CHINA CITY COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT INDEX (CEI), A MORE SCIENTIFIC SPATIAL DID MODEL WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE OPENING OF PORTS AND TRADING IN THE LATE QING DYNASTY ON THE URBAN COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, TAKING CITIES ABOVE THE PREFECTURE LEVEL IN THE YANGTZE RIVER DELTA AS A SAMPLE. THE STUDY CONFIRMS THAT: (1) THE OPENING OF PORTS AND COMMERCE IN THE LATE QING DYNASTY HAD A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE URBAN COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WAS CONDUCIVE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF PRODUCTION METHODS AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS FROM TRADITIONAL TO MODERN, AND TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE URBAN COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. (2) BEFORE THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY OF SHIMONOSEKI, THE LOCAL FORCES OF THE LATE QING DYNASTY WERE RESISTANT TO THE ECONOMIC AGGRESSION OF THE GREAT POWERS, AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE OPENING OF PORTS AND TRADING ON THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT OF PORT CITIES WAS MORE SIGNIFICANT, BUT THE IMPACT WAS NOT OBVIOUS AFTER THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY OF SHIMONOSEKI. (3) FROM THE HISTORY OF THE OPENING OF PORTS FOR TRADE IN THE LATE QING DYNASTY, THE ECONOMIC AGGRESSION OF THE WESTERN POWERS AGAINST THE NON-PATRONAGE AREAS BY MEANS OF THE BUYING CLASS OBJECTIVELY STRENGTHENED THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW AND CREDIT AWARENESS IN THE LOCAL MARKET AND EXERTED A LONG-TERM INFLUENCE ON THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT OF THE CITIES, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE OPENING OF PORTS FOR TRADE ON THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT OF THE PATRONAGE AREAS WAS NOT PROMINENT. (4) CITIES LOCATED IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF THE COMMON LAW POWERS HAD A MORE PRONOUNCED IMPACT ON THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT AS THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND CONCEPTS WERE MORE EASILY TRANSPLANTED, WHILE THE IMPACT OF THE OPENING OF PORTS AND TRADING ON THE COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT OF CITIES IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OF THE CIVIL LAW POWERS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. POLICY INSIGHTS: (1) ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES ON ECONOMIC AND TRADE MATTERS FROM A LEVEL-HEADED WORLD PERSPECTIVE, AND BE BOLD AND ADEPT AT FIGHTING UNREASONABLE RULES, STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER OPTIMISE THE BUSINESS CREDIT ENVIRONMENT; (2) REGULATE THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES AND AVOID UNDUE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE FOR IMPROVING THE BASIC SYSTEM OF THE MARKET ECONOMY TO ENHANCE THE BUSINESS CREDIT ENVIRONMENT; (3) EMPHASISE BOTH CONNOTATIVE DEVELOPMENT TO FOLLOW A CHINESE STYLE MODERNISATION PATH, AND (3) EMPHASISING SELECTIVE COOPERATION TO PROMOTE OUTWARD DEVELOPMENT, PROMOTING THE INTERACTION, CONVERGENCE AND MATCHING OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN REGULATIONS, AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING THE REGIONAL COMMERCIAL CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.
325	RARELY IS A NEW YARDSTICK OF LEGAL MEANING CREATED. BUT OVER THE PAST DECADE, CORPUS LINGUISTICS HAS BEGUN TO BE UTILIZED AS A NEW TOOL TO MEASURE ORDINARY MEANING IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION AND ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEANING IN CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION. THE LEGAL APPLICATION OF CORPUS LINGUISTICS POSITS THAT AN EXAMINATION OF EVERY USE OF A TERM IN A WIDE VARIETY OF DOCUMENTS CAN YIELD A MORE COMPLETE, IMPARTIAL UNDERSTANDING OF A WORD THAN CAN DICTIONARIES, INTUITION, OR AN UNSYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF SOURCES. CORPORA COULD SUPPLEMENT, OR EVEN SUPPLANT, DICTIONARIES AND NATIVE-SPEAKER INTUITION IN LEGAL ANALYSES. FOR ORIGINALISM IN PARTICULAR, LEGAL CORPUS LINGUISTICS PROMISES TO OFFER WHAT WOULD BE A MORE SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY FOR A POINT OF VIEW WHICH, UNTIL NOW, HAS LACKED ONE. HOWEVER, CORPUS LINGUISTICS, AS APPLIED TO LEGAL PROBLEMS, FALLS PREY TO A FATAL METHODOLOGICAL CRITICISM - THE FREQUENCY FALLACY. THE CRITICISM STATES THAT IN A CORPUS, AN UNUSUAL MEANING CAN HAVE MANY CORPUS ENTRIES WHILE A PERFECTLY ORDINARY MEANING CAN BE COMPLETELY ABSENT FROM THE CORPUS. THAT IS, FREQUENCY IS NOT A GOOD MEASURE OF MEANING. SINCE LEGAL CORPUS LINGUISTICS RELIES ON FREQUENCY, THE CORPUS CANNOT INFORM LEGAL MEANING. THIS ARTICLE PARRIES THIS OTHERWISE FATAL CRITIQUE. IT ARGUES THAT WHILE THE FREQUENCY FALLACY IS SELF-EVIDENTLY TRUE, THE FALLACY IS NOT INHERENT TO THE CORPUS, BUT RATHER IS AN ARTIFACT OF MISINTERPRETING THE CORPUS BY TREATING IT LIKE A DICTIONARY. THIS DEFENSE CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF STEPS. THE FIRST STEP DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT METHODS OF DISCERNING ORDINARY MEANING: EXTENSION AND ABSTRACTION. AS ILLUSTRATED BY YATES V. UNITED STATES AND UNITED STATES V. MARSHALL, EXTENSION ENTAILS EXTENDING THE STATUTORY TERM TO VARYING FACTS, WHILE ABSTRACTION KEEPS THE FACTS CONSTANT AND ABSTRACTS OUT KEY QUALITIES TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE TERM. CRITICALLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ABSTRACTION OFFERS A WAY TO AVOID THE FREQUENCY FALLACY. SECOND, TO USE ABSTRACTION PROPERLY, ONE MUST ANALYZE NOT ONLY THE PRESENCE OF THE LEGAL TERM IN QUESTION BUT ALSO ITS ABSENCE; THAT IS, ONE MUST DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF OTHER TERMS TO DESCRIBE A SIMILAR FACTUAL SCENARIO TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ARTIFACTS OF LANGUAGE AND FACTS ABOUT THE WORLD. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT THIS METHOD HAS A BENEFICIAL EMERGENT QUALITY. NOT ONLY DOES THIS ANSWER MAKE LEGAL CORPUS ANALYSIS METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND, BUT IT ALSO PAVES THE WAY FOR THE FIRST TOOL TO APPROXIMATE HOW AN ORDINARY PERSON WOULD READ THE LAW, THUS POTENTIALLY FURTHERING THE RULE OF LAW.
326	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO IDENTIFY, DESCRIBE, AND EXPLAIN THE GROUNDS AND CONDITIONS FOR REALIZING THE RIGHT OF REBELLION, DELIMITATION OF THE RELEVANT DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES FROM ANTI-STATE CRIMES. THE MAIN RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH ARE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES FOR THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT OF REBELLION. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT IT CAN BE REALIZED ONLY ON THE GROUNDS OF THE EXTREME NECESSITY IN RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW, THAT IS, WHILE HAVING AN EXCLUSIVELY CRIMINAL AND PREVENTIVE PURPOSE. WE HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT BOTH A DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE OF REALIZING THE RIGHT OF REBELLION CAN BE SOLELY CONSIDERED ON CONDITION OF SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION, PROOF OF THE LONG INEFFECTIVENESS OF OTHER MEANS OF INFLUENCING THE CRIMINALIZED APPARATUS OF THE STATE, IN PARTICULAR JUDICIAL ONES. IT HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR THE REALIZATION OF SUCH A RIGHT IS THE CRITICAL LEVEL OF NONCONFIDENCE TO THE PERSONNEL OF THE HIGHEST AGENCIES OF STATE POWER IN THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY TO APPLY (IMPLEMENT) THE STATUTORY FORMS OF INFLUENCE ON THEIR PERSONNEL. IT IS MANDATORY TO CONSIDER THE REQUIREMENT OF ENSURING NATIONAL SECURITY ON THE BASIS OF A SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED CRIMINOLOGICAL FORECAST OF THE DEPLOYMENT OF MASS RESISTANCE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROBABLE REACTION TO IT BY THE SUBJECTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. THUS, THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT OF REBELLION SHOULD BE NON-VIOLENT. IN ALL OTHER CASES, THERE IS A CRIMINAL SEIZURE OF STATE POWER. THE APPLIED VALUE OF THE RESEARCH IS THE FACT THAT DUE TO THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM OF GROUNDS AND CONDITIONS FOR REALIZING THE RIGHT OF REBELLION, THE LATTER, AS IT IS, MAY BE DELIMITATED FROM POLITICAL CRIMINAL PRACTICES AIMED AT DISMANTLEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATEHOOD, THE SEIZURE OF STATE POWER. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH MAY ALSO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY POLITICAL ACTORS, AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, COURTS WHILE CRIMINOLOGICAL SUBSTANTIATION, PREDICTION OF MASS RESISTANCE MEASURES, AND LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF SUCH ACTIONS. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. THE AUTHORS OF THE WORK HAVE IMPROVED THE CRIMINOLOGICAL VISION OF THE MOVEMENT OF MASS RESISTANCE, WHICH CAN TAKE PLACE BOTH IN THE FORM OF THE REALIZATION OF THE NATURAL RIGHT OF REBELLION AND IN THE FORM OF ANTI-STATE CRIMES. THE USE OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE USEFUL IN THE RETROSPECTIVE LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF THE SITUATION OF MASS PROTESTS, FORMS, MEANS, AND CONSEQUENCES OF RESPONDING TO THEM BY THE AUTHORITIES, PREVENTING ABUSE OF THE RIGHT OF REBELLION AND RELATED CRIMES.
327	SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICS HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT TURN SINCE THE DAWN OF THE DEMOCRATIC ERA IN 1994. AFTER 28 YEARS OF DEMOCRACY, THERE HAS BEEN SOME POPULISTS' AND CONSTITUTIONALISTS' TENSION IN DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA. THE MANDELA AND MBEKI PRESIDENCIES ARE MARKED FOR CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHILE THE ZUMA TENURE OF NINE YEARS IS MARKED AS THE ERA OF POPULISM. THE CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC ALREADY EXPERIENCES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE POLITICS OF THE POPULISTS AND OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISTS. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYSE THE CONCEPTS OF POPULISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM AND INVITES PUBLIC THEOLOGY TO DIALOGUE WITH THESE POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES IN ORDER TO BRING HARMONIOUS COEXISTENCE IN DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA. THROUGH THE LITERATURE STUDY AND LATEST PRESS RELEASE STATEMENTS, INCIDENTS AND CONCEPTS WERE DISCOVERED TO GIVE DEFINITIONS AND THE ANALYSES OF POPULISM, CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND PUBLIC THEOLOGY. PUBLIC THEOLOGY IS CHOSEN AGAINST POLITICAL THEOLOGY, DUE TO THE EMPHASIS OF DIALOGUE AS A MANNER OF MAKING THEOLOGICAL STATEMENTS. IT IS REALISED THAT POPULISTS ARE FULL OF CHARISMA, AND THEY USE THIS TO CHARM THE MASSES, OFFERING THEM PROMISES OF PROSPERITY AND PEACE, WHILE IN FACT THEY REGARD THEMSELVES AS THE MASSES, AS THEY ARE THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. THEY CARRY THE AGENDA OF ENTITLEMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RESEARCH FINDS THAT CONSTITUTIONALISTS APPLY RATIONALITY TO CONSTITUTIONAL DICTATES IN ORDER TO GOVERN FOR DEMOCRATIC STABILITY IN SOCIETY. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES CITIZENS' SAFETY AND SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. BY READING THIS ARTICLE ONE FINDS THAT THIS RESEARCH EMPHASISES THAT PUBLIC THEOLOGY THROUGH ITS DIALOGICAL NATURE, PROPHETIC CALLING, ANTHROPOLOGICAL CENTRICITY, ENGAGING METHODOLOGY, IS INHERENTLY MISSIONAL IN THE POLITICALLY CHAOTIC WORLD. AS A DISCIPLINE, PUBLIC THEOLOGY IS INTRADISCIPLINARY, THEREFORE ENGAGES OTHER THEOLOGICAL FIELDS, INCLUDING NATURAL AND SOCIAL DISCIPLINES IN ORDER TO REINFORCE ITS MISSIONAL CHARACTER. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT PUBLIC THEOLOGY SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT, INVITING POLITICIANS FROM DIFFERENT SPECTRUMS AND CONVICTIONS TO THE TABLE OF DIALOGUE. DIALOGUE PAVES THE WAY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING, SYNERGY, AND TRUST. THEO-POLITICAL INTERACTIONS ARE CRUCIAL TOWARDS JUSTICE FORMATION, WHICH BUILDS SOCIETAL HARMONY AND PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE. POLITICAL TENSIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA OFFER PUBLIC THEOLOGY A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT ITSELF IN CIVIL AFFAIRS, AND MAKES ITS VOICE AUDIBLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. CONTRIBUTION: THE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IN THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS THE IMPORTANCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLITICAL STUDIES AND THEOLOGY. LEGAL STUDIES, HISTORY, AND CURRENT AFFAIRS ENRICH THE THEOLOGICAL ROLE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS. POPULISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM ARE POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES IN TENSION, AND PUBLIC THEOLOGY THROUGH DIALOGUE, CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS PEACEFUL LIFE IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE.
328	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE CONTEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE COMPANY-INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS TO ANALYZE THE DISCLOSURE OF CARBON EMISSIONS AND THE EFFICIENCY OF EMISSIONS FROM THE INCORPORATION OF A CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. THIS STUDY IS BASED ON TWO MODELS: I) CARBON EMISSIONS DISCLOSURE AND II) EFFICIENCY OF CARBON EMISSIONS. WE DEVELOP THE MODELS USING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A) THE ADOPTION OF A CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CARBON EMISSIONS AND B) THE IMPACT OF HAVING A CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND THE EFFICIENCY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS BY COLOMBIAN COMPANIES. WE USE AN ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE REGRESSION MODEL FOR THE CARBON EMISSIONS DISCLOSURE MODEL AND A ROBUST ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE MODEL ON THE EFFICIENCY MODEL OF CARBON EMISSIONS BASED ON A BALANCED PANEL DATA OF COLOMBIAN LISTED COMPANIES FOR THE PERIOD 2016-2019 AND WE TAKE SUB-SAMPLES TO ANALYZE SCOPE 1, SCOPE 2 AND SCOPE 3. THE STUDY INCLUDES VARIABLES IN RELATION TO THE COMPANIES' CONTEXT (FISCAL STRATEGY THROUGH CARBON TAXATION AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION) AND COMPANY-INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS (SIZE AND SENSITIVE INDUSTRY SECTOR). THE RESULTS OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS DISCLOSURE MODEL SUGGEST THAT, IN LARGE COMPANIES, THERE IS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ADOPTION OF A CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND THE DISCLOSURE OF EMISSIONS FOR SCOPES 1 AND 2. SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES DISCLOSE THE THREE SCOPE LEVELS. IN THE REGIONAL ANALYSIS, THE QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON THE SCOPE IS SCARCE AND SUGGESTS THAT COMPANIES ARE NOT WILLING TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT SENDS A NEGATIVE SIGNAL OF THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS TO THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS EFFICIENCY MODEL SHOW AN IMPORTANT CONNECTION WITH THE INDEBTEDNESS OF COMPANIES AS A LEVERAGE MECHANISM TO ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY OR MANAGE INNOVATION PROJECTS FOR A MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SHAREHOLDERS ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON EFFICIENCY. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A GROWING INTEREST IN INCORPORATING ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA INTO THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THE EFFECT OF OBTAINING INFORMATION ON EMISSIONS THROUGH VOLUNTARY REPORTS. THE CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INDEX IS POSITIVE FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF CONTROLLED INDIRECT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 2). THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGIES FOCUS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION OR THE USE OF RENEWABLE SOURCES TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL COSTS AND EMISSION INDICATORS. THIS STUDY IS INNOVATIVE BECAUSE IT IS FOCUSED ON A COUNTRY WITHOUT ESTABLISHED GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS AND IT IS IN A COMPLEX SCENARIO WHERE POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE AFFECTED. THIS STUDY RAISES A POTENTIAL TOPIC TO EXPLORE FURTHER BECAUSE THE TOPIC IS IN A GERMINAL STAGE IN THE ACADEMIC AND BUSINESS FIELD.
329	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO PROBLEMS OF THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION, THE DELIMITATION OF THE CONCEPTS OF SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ANALYZE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (PARTICULAR INTEREST IN IT IS DUE TO ITS SPECIFIC LEGAL NATURE) IN THE FIELD OF ENSURING THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND, ABOVE ALL, TO INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF ENSURING IT BY SECURITY MEASURES. IN THE AUTHOR'S OPINION, THE PROPOSED THEME IS HIGHLY RELEVANT IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT IN TODAY'S REALITIES, WHEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE CORE VALUES PROCLAIMED IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, 1948, AND REFLECTED IN THE 1993 CONSTITUTION OF RUSSIA, THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE COURSE OF LEGAL ACTION REQUIRE SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION. THE STUDY ANALYZED THE THEORETICAL (WORKS BY D.A. AVDEEV, T.I. ALIYEV, E.V. BERDNIKOV, N.S. BONDAR, V.D. ZORKIN, M.A. MITYUKOV, V.A. KRYAZHKOV, L.V. LAZAREV, S.A. SAVCHENKO, B.S. EBZEEV) AND EMPIRICAL (THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION; THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW "ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION"; TERMS AND DEFINITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) MATERIAL. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH WAS THE FORMAL-LOGICAL METHOD, WHICH ALLOWED TO CLARIFY THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT DISTINGUISH IT IN THE STATICS AND DYNAMICS FROM OTHER NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS; THE SYSTEMATIC METHOD USED TO ENSURE THE COMPREHENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULARITIES IN THE ACTIVITIES OF STATE AUTHORITIES AND LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, THUS FORMING A SPECIFIC SYSTEM OF STATE-LEGAL PROTECTION AND PROTECTION OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS. AS A RESULT, THE AUTHOR CAME TO A CONCLUSION THAT ENSURING THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION BY SECURITY MEASURES IS ESSENTIAL. IT IS A SPECIFIC RATHER ABSTRACT ACTIVITY, THE RESULT OF WHICH IS TO PREVENT THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE LEGAL ACTIVITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THIS AREA IS CONNECTED WITH THE SPECIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION OF THE MEANING OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS. THE MAIN CRITERION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS "SUPERSTRUCTURE" OF THE CONSTITUTION IS ITS OWN RULES THAT FIX THE BASIC PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT.
330	THE ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES MAKES IT NECESSARY TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL TREND OF SUBSTITUTING THE THEORETICAL CONCEPT OF A LAW-GOVERNED STATE BY THE PRACTICE OF ABUSE OF POWER BY THE POLICE. THE ABUSE OF POWER BY THE POLICE AND OTHER SECURITY FORCES IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS MOST EVIDENT IN TWO AREAS: CORRUPTION AND CRIMES IN THE SPHERE OF JUSTICE. IN THIS CONNECTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE VALIDITY OF THE CONCEPTS OF CRIMINAL LAW REACTION AND THE PRACTICE OF ITS ENFORCEMENT IN CASES OF ABUSE OF POWER BY THE POLICE. A STUDY OF THE WORK OF THE INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS OMBUDSMEN MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO STATE THAT IT IS FOCUSED ON PROVING THAT SECURITY FORCES "HARASS BUSINESS". NO PERSUASIVE PROOF IS PRESENTED THAT SUPPORTS THIS CLAIM. NEVERTHELESS, THE LAWMAKERS PURSUE THE POLICY OF SELECTING A SPECIAL SUBJECT OF CRIME WITH A LOWERED CRIMINAL LIABILITY - AN ENTREPRENEUR, THUS VIOLATING THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF SECURITY FORCES WHO FOUND THEIR OWN NICHE IN THE MARKET ECONOMY. THIS IS THE NICHE OF CORRUPTION. CORRUPTION PRESSURE ON BUSINESSES MOST OFTEN TAKES THE SHAPE OF EXTORTING BRIBES AND PROVOKING CORRUPTION. THE PROVOCATION AND INCITEMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE POLICE OFTEN INVOLVE THOSE CITIZENS WHO LATER ARE PROSECUTED FOR CRIMES CONNECTED WITH ILLEGAL TRADE IN DRUGS, AND FOR INSULTING AUTHORITIES. IN THIS CONNECTION, THE NEGATIVE ATTITUDE OF A CONSIDERABLE PART OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY TO THE POLICE IS NOT SURPRISING. THIS ATTITUDE IS, TO A GREAT DEGREE, FORMED BY DISCREDITING LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES. RUSSIAN MASS MEDIA HAVE BEEN WORKING LONG AND HARD TO CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE POLICE. THE AUTHORS OF THE "GANGSTERS VS. COP" SERIES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THIS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PARADIGM "BUSINESS IN RUSSIA IS UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CRIMINAL LEGISLATION, AND SECURITY FORCES "HARASS BUSINESS" IS FAKE. THE INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS OMBUDSMEN SHOULD REJECT IT AND FOCUS OF IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING THE CAUSES AND CONDITIONS OF THE SITUATION THAT MADE LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES SUBJECTS OF MARKET RELATIONS. IT IS NECESSARY TO RADICALLY OPPOSE THE LEGALIZATION OF CRIME PROVOCATION ("LEGITIMATE PROVOCATION") THAT SOME AUTHORS SUGGEST. ANY FACILITATION TO THE PROVOCATION ACTIVITIES OF SECURITY FORCES LOOKS LIKE A DECISIVE REFUSAL TO PROTECT CITIZENS, WHICH OPENS THE GATES TO WIDESPREAD LAWLESSNESS AND, FROM THE LEGAL STANDPOINT, IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. THE EXISTING OPERATIVE AND INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE QUITE ADEQUATE FOR DETECTING REAL OFFENDERS.
331	WESTERN SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT IMAGE MAKING AND IMAGE MANAGEMENT ARE A PREOCCUPATION OF THE JUDICIARY. IMAGES OF THE JUDICIARY MAY TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS AND BE PRODUCED FOR KINDS OF AUDIENCES. ONE FORM OF JUDICIAL IMAGE MAKING AND IMAGE MANAGEMENT IS LIVE PERFORMANCES IN THE COURTROOM AND OTHER COURT SETTINGS. ANOTHER IS THE WRITTEN JUDGMENT WHERE THE PREOCCUPATION IS THE STYLE OF THE WRITTEN TEXT. PRESS AND OTHER MASS MEDIA REPORTS OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY ARE ANOTHER. THE AUDIENCE FOR JUDICIAL IMAGES IS EQUALLY DIVERSE, FROM FELLOW JUDGES, LAWYERS IN THE COURTS AND THE WIDER LEGAL COMMUNITY, THE LITIGANTS BEFORE THE COURTS TO THE EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC BOTH IN THE COURTROOM AND BEYOND. THE IMAGE OF THE JUDICIARY THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC HAS A PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IN WESTERN RULE OF LAW DEMOCRACIES. AS A GENERAL RULE COURTS AND THE JUDICIARY ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE IN PUBLIC AND THEIR ACTIVITIES MUST BE OPEN TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY. A RECENT POLICY MANIFESTATION OF THIS GOAL IS DEBATED ABOUT CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE. IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES PUBLIC SCRUTINY OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDICIARY RELIES UPON THE MEDIA. OBJECTIVE AND ACCURATE PRESS AND MEDIA REPORTS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE JUDICIARY AND GENERATING OR UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THAT INSTITUTION. REPORTS IN REGIONAL AND NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS HAVE LONG BEEN AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION, SHAPING PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND FACILITATING PUBLIC SCRUTINY OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN THE UK, THERE IS ALMOST NO SCHOLARSHIP ON THESE REPRESENTATIONS PAST OR PRESENT. THE RESULT IS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF THE COURTS AND THE JUDICIARY IN PRESS REPORTS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHAT THE DILIGENT READER OF THESE REPORTS CAN LEARN ABOUT JUDICIAL ACTIVITY. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO TAKE A FIRST STEP TOWARDS CHANGING THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS. IT USES A DATA SET MADE UP OF 205 CONTEMPORARY DOMESTIC NEWSPAPER REPORTS OF COURT AND JUDICIAL ACTIVITY. THESE COME FROM A SAMPLE OF 24 DAILY NEWSPAPERS: 10 NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS AND 14 FROM THE REGIONS. ALL WERE PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY 16TH FEBRUARY 2012, AN UNEXCEPTIONAL DAY IN THE LIFE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE PRESS. THE MODEST GOAL OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO OFFER AN ANALYSIS OF THIS SNAPSHOT OF JUDICIAL ACTIVITY IN THE PRESS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE PRESS IN ENABLING PUBLIC SCRUTINY OF THE JUDICIARY.
332	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL DISTANCE AND HOST COUNTRY ATTRACTIVENESS IN LOCATION DETERMINANTS OF CHINESE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN EU IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BILATERAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A FIRM-LEVEL MINISTRY OF COMMERCE (MOFCOM) DATABASE OF GREENFIELD AND NON-GREENFIELD CHINESE INVESTMENTS ABROAD IS USED. A SIX FIXED-EFFECTS LOGIT ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED. FINDINGS - CHINESE FIRMS TEND TO INVEST IN EU COUNTRIES WITH REDUCED RULE OF LAW; MARKET AFFLUENCE IS AN ATTRACTION FACTOR FOR THEM, BUT THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE HUMAN CAPITAL ASSET-SEEKERS. COUNTRIES WITH POLITICALLY STABLE ENVIRONMENT ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO SALES/SERVICES SUBSIDIARIES; WHILE COUNTRIES WITH GOOD CONTROL OF CORRUPTION, LOW TRADE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING FOREIGN OWNERSHIP ARE MOST ATTRACTIVE TO MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES. A LARGE MARKET IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FACTOR FOR R&D SUBSIDIARIES, AND A RICH MARKET IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE FACTOR FOR MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES. MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES ARE MORE TECHNOLOGICAL ASSET-SEEKERS. R&D SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE MOST NON-HUMAN CAPITAL ASSET-SEEKERS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY EXTENDS THE STATE OF THE ART OF THE LITERATURE BY DEVELOPING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, GROUNDED ON THE INFLUENCE OF HOST COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AND ON ENDOWMENT OF RESOURCES ON THE LOCATION CHOICE OF CHINESE INVESTORS. FURTHER VARIABLES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FUTURE (INDUSTRIAL SPECIALIZATION OF HOST COUNTRY, CULTURAL DISTANCE, BILATERAL TIES). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE RELEVANT. THEY ARE RELATED BOTH TO OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ATTRACTION POLICIES AND TO EUROPE-CHINA COOPERATION DIALOGUE. WITH REFERENCE TO ATTRACTION POLICIES, AS CHINESE GREEN FIRMS ARE TECHNOLOGICAL ASSET-SEEKERS, MORE THAN HUMAN CAPITAL ASSET-SEEKERS, EU COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN PARTNERING WITH CHINESE INVESTORS SHOULD DEVELOP SPECIFIC MEASURES TARGETING ENCOURAGING TECHNOLOGY SPILLOVER. EVEN R&D SUBSIDIARIES SHOULD BE TEMPTED WITH TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED MEASURES. WITH REFERENCE TO EUROPE-CHINA COOPERATION, THE PAPER FINDINGS SUPPORT SUGGESTIONS FOR A MORE ACTIVE EUROPEAN POSITION ON FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN KEY EUROPEAN ENERGY SECTORS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PAPER IS GROUNDED ON AN IMPROVED THEORETICAL MODEL, TESTED THROUGH A UNIQUE MOFCOM FIRM-LEVEL DATABASE. ORIGINALITY LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE AUTHORS PROVIDE A SECTORAL INSIGHT. THE NEED FOR SECTORAL ANALYSIS IS FUNDAMENTAL AS CHINESE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONALIZATION PATH VARY EXTENSIVELY ACROSS INDUSTRY, DUE TO POLICY INTERVENTIONS, SUPPORTIVE MEASURES AND PRIORITIZED INITIATIVES. ZHANG ET AL. (2011, P. 229) FOUND THAT - SPECIFICALLY - THE ENERGY SECTOR IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO HOST COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, THEREFORE CHINESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO REGULATORY AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURE COMPARED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES.
333	THE SCOURGE OF SOMALI PIRACY HAS IMPERILED THE FREE MOVEMENT OF COMMERCIAL SHIPPING VESSELS IN THE GULF OF ADEN, A MAJOR CONDUIT OF GLOBAL COMMERCE. A "GRAND ARMADA" OF INTERNATIONAL NAVAL FORCES SENT TO SAFEGUARD COMMERCIAL VESSELS NEAR SOMALIA HAS BEEN UNABLE TO STEM THE GROWTH OF SOMALI PIRATE SYNDICATES CAPABLE OF BRAZEN ATTACKS AND BOLSTERED BY THE PROMISE OF MULTIMILLION DOLLAR RANSOMS. THIS COMMENT EXPLORES THE COMMERCIAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY'S INCREASING RELIANCE ON PRIVATE MILITARY AND SECURITY COMPANIES (PMSCS) TO SECURE THEIR VESSELS, CARGO, AND CREWS FROM PIRATE ATTACKS. THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED PMSC EMPLOYMENT ABOARD COMMERCIAL VESSELS, CITING THE INEVITABLE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AND EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE THAT ARE PART OF THE PMSC MODUS OPERANDI. THIS COMMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE FACTUAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT ANIMATE THESE CONCERNS AND SUGGESTS THAT THE PMSC MISCONDUCT IN THE CONFLICTS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN PROVIDE INSTRUCTIVE, INDEED CRITICAL, LESSONS REGARDING THE RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYMENT OF PMSC FORCES TO COMBAT PIRACY. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THIS COMMENT INTRODUCES THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT, AN INTERNATIONALLY DEVELOPED CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PMSCS PARTICIPATING IN ARMED CONFLICT THAT RECALLS AND AFFIRMS THE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) OBLIGATIONS OF THESE ARMED CONTRACTORS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS. THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT, WHICH CAN BE READILY INTEGRATED INTO PMSC OPERATIONS THROUGH CONTRACTUAL MACHINERY, IS THE FOUNDATIONAL TOOL BY WHICH THESE PRIVATE SECURITY PROVIDERS CAN ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AS PROFESSIONAL ENTITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE COMMENT FURTHER ANALYZES WHETHER THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT, THOUGH CLEARLY RELEVANT TO ARMED CONFLICT ON LAND, IS RENDERED INAPPOSITE IN THE CONTEXT OF COUNTERPIRACY OPERATIONS. IN SO DOING, THIS COMMENT EXAMINES THE CURRENT MAJORITY POSITION THAT SOMALI PIRACY IS NOT "ARMED CONFLICT" UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THUS NOT SUBJECT TO THE IHL OBLIGATIONS THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT SEEKS TO AFFIRM. FURTHERMORE, THE UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION OF PIRACY SINCE 2008, COMBINED WITH THE EXPLICIT INVOCATION OF 1111, BY SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1851, SUGGEST THAT PIRACY MAY INCREASINGLY BE VIEWED AS "ARMED CONFLICT" IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY, THIS COMMENT ARGUES THAT EVEN IF IHL IS NOT PRESENTLY APPLICABLE TO COUNTERPIRACY OPERATIONS AS "ARMED CONFLICT," CONTRACT LAW PROVIDES A METHOD OF INCORPORATING IHL, BY WAY OF THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT, INTO PMSC COUNTERPIRACY OPERATIONS. WILL THE COMMERCIAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY HEED THIS CALL AND DEMAND THAT THEIR PMSC FORCES OPERATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MONTREUX DOCUMENT? IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CONDUCT OF THE PMSCS PROTECTING ITS ASSETS AND CREWMEMBERS, HONOR ITS INTERNATIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, AND RESPONSIBLY PURSUE THE MOST VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE PIRACY EPIDEMIC IN THE GULF OF ADEN, THIS COMMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT MUST.
334	FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, POST-COMMUNISTS SYSTEMS INCLUDE BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND NON-DEMOCRATIC NATIONS. FROM AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT, THEY INCLUDE BOTH COLLAPSING AND EXPANDING ECONOMIES. ALL FOUR LOGICAL POSSIBILITIES EXIST FOR POST-COMMUNIST POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS AN EXAMPLE OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND AN EXPANDING ECONOMIC SYSTEM. RUSSIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND A COLLAPSING ECONOMIC SYSTEM. CHINA IS AN EXAMPLE OF A NON-DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL,SYSTEM AND AN EXPANDING ECONOMIC SYSTEM. NORTH KOREA IS AN EXAMPLE OF A NON-DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND A COLLAPSING ECONOMIC SYSTEM. THE FACT THAT ALL FOUR LOGICAL POSSIBILITIES EXIST SUGGESTS THAT DEMOCRACY IS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT FOR GOOD ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, DEMOCRACY IS CERTAINLY A VALUE IN ITSELF THAT REQUIRES CERTAIN BASIC INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, THE ORDERLY TRANSFER OF POWER TO THOSE ELECTED, THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, CMD THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND BASIC LIBERTIES, INCLUDING THOSE OF SPEECH, PRESS, RELIGION, ASSEMBLY, PROPERTY, AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. ECONOMIC POLICIES, RATHER THAN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT, DETERMINE THE RESULTS FOR AN ECONOMY. RUSSIA AND CHINA, THE TWO LARGEST SOCIALIST ECONOMIES, FOLLOWED VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC POLICIES AND EXPERIENCED RADICALLY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES. THE FAILURE OF "SHOCK THERAPY" ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY IN RUSSIA IS RELATED TO ITS USE OF THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS SLP PACKAGE OF STABILIZATION, LIBERALIZATION, AND PRIVATIZATION, CLS RECOMMENDED BY THE WORLD BANK AND THE IMF. THE SUCCESS OF DENG'S ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY IN CHINA IS RELATED TO ITS REJECTION OF THE SLP IN FAVOR OF THE ICG APPROACH OF INSTITUTIONS, COMPETITION, AND GOVERNMENT. OTHER INTERESTING CASES ARE THOSE OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND NORTH KOREA. THOSE NATIONS IN WHICH BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS HAVE BEEN SIMULTANEOUSLY SUCCESSFUL, SUCH AS THE CZECH REPUBLIC, ARE GENERALLY, SMALL, HOMOGENEOUS EUROPEAN NATIONS WITH A HISTORIC WORK ETHIC, WITH A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF SOCIALISM, AND WITH SUPPORT FROM NEIGHBORING ADVANCED INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS. THERE IS GREAT DIFFICULTY IN SIMULTANEOUSLY ESTABLISHING BOTH DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET ECONOMY WITHOUT A VERY SPECIAL SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE A SEQUENCE FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORM. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, THE IDEAL OF BOTH DEMOCRACY AND A MARKET ECONOMY MAY BE ATTAINED EVEN IN NATIONS WITHOUT SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE, WITH RUSSIA EVENTUALLY FILMING ITS ECONOMY AROUND AND WITH CHINA EVENTUALLY REFORMING POLITICALLY INTO A DEMOCRATIC NATION.
335	THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO ARTICLES RELAYING THE RESULTS OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE SURVEY TO DATE OF 137 CONGRESSIONAL DRAFTERS ABOUT THE DOCTRINES OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE DELEGATION. THE FIRST ARTICLE FOCUSED ON OUR RESPONDENTS' KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF THE INTERPRETIVE PRINCIPLES THAT COURTS APPLY. THIS SECOND ARTICLE MOVES AWAY FROM THE JUDICIAL PERSPECTIVE. OUR FINDINGS HERE HIGHLIGHT THE OVERLOOKED LEGISLATIVE UNDERBELLY: THE PERSONNEL, STRUCTURAL, AND PROCESS-RELATED FACTORS THAT, OUR RESPONDENTS REPEATEDLY VOLUNTEERED, DRIVE THE DETAILS OF THE DRAFTING PROCESS MORE THAN JUDICIAL RULES OF INTERPRETATION. THESE FACTORS RANGE FROM THE FRAGMENTATION CAUSED BY THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM, TO THE CENTRALITY OF NONPARTISAN PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN THE DRAFTING OF STATUTORY TEXT, TO THE USE OF INCREASINGLY UNORTHODOX LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES EACH OF WHICH, OUR RESPONDENTS TOLD US, AFFECTS STATUTORY CONSISTENCY AND USE OF LEGISLATIVE HISTORY IN DIFFERENT AND IMPORTANT WAYS. OUR RESPONDENTS ALSO PAINTED A PICTURE OF LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS IN A PRIMARY INTERPRETIVE CONVERSATION WITH AGENCIES, NOT WITH COURTS, AND AS USING DIFFERENT KINDS OF SIGNALS FOR THEIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH AGENCIES THAN COURTS CONSIDER. MOST OF THE STRUCTURAL, PERSONNEL, AND PROCESS-RELATED INFLUENCES THAT OUR RESPONDENTS EMPHASIZED HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED BY COURTS OR SCHOLARS, BUT UNDERSTANDING THEM CALLS INTO QUESTION ALMOST EVERY PRESUMPTION OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IN CURRENT DEPLOYMENT. THE FINDINGS UNDERMINE THE CLAIMS OF BOTH TEXTUALISTS AND PURPOSIVISTS THAT THEIR THEORIES ARE MOST DEMOCRACY ENHANCING, BECAUSE NEITHER MAKES SATISFACTORY EFFORTS TO REALLY REFLECT CONGRESSIONAL EXPECTATIONS. OUR FINDINGS CHALLENGE TEXTUALISM'S OPERATING ASSUMPTION THAT TEXT IS ALWAYS THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BARGAIN AND SUGGEST MORE RELEVANT BUT STILL FORMALIST STRUCTURAL FEATURES THAT MIGHT DO BETTER. OUR FINDINGS FURTHER REVEAL THAT, ALTHOUGH PURPOSIVISTS OR ECLECTIC THEORISTS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT IDEA WITH A MORE CONTEXTUAL APPROACH, MANY OF THE FACTORS ON WHICH THEY FOCUS ARE NOT THE SAME ONES THAT CONGRESS UTILIZES. WITH RESPECT TO DELEGATION, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, FOR BOTH TYPES OF THEORISTS, CHEVRON NOW SEEMS TOO TEXT- AND COURT-CENTRIC TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE CONGRESSIONAL INTENT TO DELEGATE, ALTHOUGH THAT HAS BEEN ITS ASSERTED PURPOSE. IN THE END, OUR FINDINGS RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE KIND OF "FAITHFUL AGENT" APPROACH TO INTERPRETATION THAT MOST JUDGES CURRENTLY EMPLOY ONE AIMED AT EFFECTUATING LEGISLATIVE DEALS AND OFTEN FOCUSED ON GRANULAR TEXTUAL DETAILS CAN EVER BE SUCCESSFUL. WE THUS LOOK TO DIFFERENT PARADIGMS LESS DEPENDENT ON HOW CONGRESS WORKS, INCLUDING RULE-OF-LAW AND PRAGMATIC APPROACHES TO INTERPRETATION. THESE ALTERNATIVES RESPOND TO THE PROBLEM OF THE SAUSAGE FACTORY, BUT POSE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN LIGHT OF THE MODERN JUDICIAL SENSIBILITY'S PRONOUNCED CONCERN WITH LEGISLATIVE SUPREMACY.
336	THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE ON THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM HAS REPEATEDLY CONCLUDED THAT EVICTION COURTS ARE COURTS OF MASS SETTLEMENT. IN COURT HALLWAYS, LANDLORDS' ATTORNEYS PRESSURE UNREPRESENTED TENANTS INTO SIGNING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IN A FACTORY-LIKE PROCESS, AND JUDGES APPROVE THE AGREEMENTS WITH A PERFUNCTORY RUBBER STAMP. YET WHILE WE KNOW MOST EVICTION CASES SETTLE, NO ONE HAS ASKED, MUCH LESS ANSWERED, THE SALIENT FOLLOW-UP QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENTS? BASED ON A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF EVICTION CASES IN ONE JURISDICTION, THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND, IN DOING SO, GENERATES A NOVEL THEORY ABOUT THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES EMPIRICALLY THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF EVICTION SETTLEMENTS IN THE STUDY JURISDICTION CONTAIN A DISTINCT SET OF INTERLOCKING TERMS THAT AMOUNT TO WHAT THE ARTICLE LABELS "CIVIL PROBATION." CIVIL PROBATION IS THE CIVIL ANALOGUE IN THE EVICTION CONTEXT TO PROBATION IN THE CRIMINAL CONTEXT. SPECIFICALLY, IT IS THE IMPOSITION OF COURT-ORDERED CONDITIONS ON A PERSON'S TENANCY THAT, IF VIOLATED, CAN RESULT IN SWIFT EVICTION THROUGH AN ALTERNATIVE LEGAL PROCESS. THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO IDENTIFY AND CONCEPTUALIZE THE PHENOMENON OF CIVIL PROBATION IN THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE EMPIRICALLY DOCUMENTS THE PREVALENCE AND FEATURES OF CIVIL PROBATION IN EVICTION PROCEEDINGS IN THE STUDY JURISDICTION. THE ARTICLE THEN ADVOCATES FOR A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF CIVIL PROBATION'S CONSEQUENCES. THESE CONSEQUENCES ARE THREEFOLD. FIRST, CIVIL PROBATION GIVES RISE TO A SHADOW LEGAL SYSTEM BY ESTABLISHING PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE RULES FOR EVICTION THAT DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THOSE ESTABLISHED BY STATUTORY LAW. THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT TENANTS ARE SUBJECT TO THESE RULES AT A WIDESPREAD, PERVASIVE LEVEL, AND THAT THE RULES UNDERLIE THE VAST MAJORITY OF EVICTION ORDERS ISSUED BY JUDGES. THIS SHADOW LEGAL SYSTEM UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW, ERODES SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS, AND THREATENS PUBLIC REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT. SECOND, CIVIL PROBATION RESULTS IN THE EXPANSION OF LANDLORD CONTROL. IT BOTH INCREASES THE NUMBER OF TENANCY TERMS WITH WHICH TENANTS MUST COMPLY AND STRENGTHENS LANDLORDS' TOOL FOR ENFORCING THOSE TERMS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EXPANSION OF LANDLORD CONTROL IS A PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM. AND THIRD, CIVIL PROBATION RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT A PHENOMENON OF "NET -WIDENING" OF THE EVICTION LEGAL SYSTEM IS OCCURRING, AKIN TO THE PHENOMENON THAT SCHOLARS HAVE DOCUMENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL PROBATION. THE ARTICLE OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM BASED ON THESE CONCLUSIONS.
337	IN RECENT YEARS, CONGRESS HAS REPEATEDLY FAILED TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS NECESSARY TO HONOR LEGAL COMMITMENTS (OR ENTITLEMENTS) THAT ARE THEMSELVES ENACTED IN PERMANENT LAW. THE APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE HAS FORCED THE GOVERNMENT TO DEFY LEGISLATIVE COMMAND AND BREAK SUCH COMMITMENTS, WITH DESTRUCTIVE RESULTS FOR RECIPIENTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE IS THE FIRST TO ADDRESS THIS POORLY UNDERSTOOD PHENOMENON, WHICH IT LABELS A FORM OF "DISAPPROPRIATION." THE ARTICLE THEORIZES RECENT HIGH-PROFILE DISAPPROPRIATIONS AS ONE PROBABILISTIC CONSEQUENCE OF CONGRESS'S DECISION TO CREATE PERMANENT LEGISLATIVE PAYMENT COMMITMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT HONOR WITHOUT PERIODIC, TEMPORARY APPROPRIATIONS. SUCH PARTIALLY TEMPORARY PROGRAMS INCLUDE MEDICAID AND SCORES OF OTHER IMPORTANT, PERMANENT FEATURES OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THE ARTICLE'S CORE DESCRIPTIVE CONTRIBUTION IS TO EXPLAIN THAT WHILE DISSONANCE BETWEEN CONGRESS'S LEGISLATIVE AND APPROPRIATIONS POWERS CREATES THE DESTRUCTIVE POSSIBILITY OF DISAPPROPRIATION, IT CAN ALSO PRESERVE FOR CONGRESS ENDURING INFLUENCE (OVER THE EXECUTIVE) AND MAJORITARIAN CONTROL (AGAINST THE "DEAD HAND" AND LEADERSHIP) THAT CONGRESS WOULD SURRENDER IF IT INSTEAD EXERCISED BOTH ITS LEGISLATIVE AND APPROPRIATIONS POWERS PERMANENTLY. THIS INSIGHT-THAT CONGRESS'S ABILITY TO LEGISLATE PERMANENTLY BUT APPROPRIATE TEMPORARILY MAKES DISAPPROPRIATION POSSIBLE BUT ALSO ALTERS THE BALANCE OF POWERS-HAS THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE DESIGN OF NEW LEGISLATIVE COMMITMENTS, AND EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE HARMS OF DISAPPROPRIATION. THE ARTICLE'S NORMATIVE COMPONENT ADDRESSES THE REGULATION AND ADJUDICATION OF DISAPPROPRIATION IN LIGHT OF THESE IMPLICATIONS. IT CONCEPTUALIZES SHUTDOWNS AS AGGREGATIONS OF DISTINCTIVE DISAPPROPRIATIONS AND CAUTIONS THAT PRIOR SCHOLARLY ANALYSES OF PROPOSALS TO PREVENT SHUTDOWNS BY FINANCIALLY PENALIZING LEGISLATORS FOR FAILING TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS NECESSARY TO HONOR PRE-EXISTING COMMITMENTS ARE INCOMPLETE BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO CONSIDER UPSTREAM IMPACTS ON THE BALANCE OF POWERS. AND IT EXPLAINS THAT COURTS COULD PLAY A SALUTARY ROLE WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE BALANCE OF POWERS BY FAVORING RULES THAT PROMOTE DURABILITY BUT NOT ENTRENCHMENT, THAT IS, BY ADOPTING RULES THAT TEND TO REDUCE THE EX ANTE LIKELIHOOD OF DISAPPROPRIATION WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE CREDIBILITY OF THE THREAT OF DISAPPROPRIATION. IN PRACTICE, THIS WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF JUDICIAL APPROACHES THAT PREVENT INADVERTENT DISAPPROPRIATION BY REDUCING UNCERTAINTY AND PRIVATE INFORMATION. COURTS SHOULD THEREFORE ADOPT AN INTERPRETIVE PRESUMPTION AGAINST DISAPPROPRIATION, EMPOWER CIVIL SERVANTS TO ENFORCE DISAPPROPRIATION EX ANTE RATHER THAN EMPOWER CONGRESS TO DO SO EX POST (AS THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SOUGHT TO DO IN HOUSE V. BURWELL), AND ENDEAVOR TO ADJUDICATE ACTIONS SEEKING DAMAGES IN THE AFTERMATH OF DISAPPROPRIATION IN WAYS THAT MAKE THE AVAILABILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES MORE PREDICTABLE WHILE AVOIDING INTERFERENCE WITH THE POLITICAL BRANCHES.
338	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO OUTLINE THOSE ESSENTIAL DISTINCTIONS OF ETHICAL SOCIALISM FROM A RADICAL OR LEFT SOCIALISM, NAMELY, NOT IN THE POLITICAL PLANE, BUT IN RESPECT OF DEVELOPMENT OF "ETHICAL" DOCTRINES. WHY THE MORAL AND LEGAL ASPECT IN PHILOSOPHY OF ETHICAL SOCIALISM AND AS KANT'S CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE CAN ENRICH DIALECTIC MATERIALISM, AND ALSO SHOW WHY IT IS BETTER TO CHANGE SOCIAL REALITY PEACEFULLY, INSTEAD OF WORLD REVOLUTIONS, HAT IS SO IMPORTANT. PROCEEDING FROM COHEN, COMMUNISM AS TELOS (GOAL) OF HISTORY UNFOLDS THROUGH DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND UPHOLDS THE DENIAL HERE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF REVOLUTION. THUS DIALECTICAL THINKING SEEMS TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF NON-RADICAL CHANGE THROUGH TRANSFORMATIVE STEPS OF LAWS, AND CALLS INSTEAD FOR A CLASS POLARIZATION AND STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE, REGARDLESS OF THE EMPIRICAL CONDITIONS WHERE IT IS LOCATED. THE VERY "UNJUSTIFIED" VIOLENCE IS CONTRARY TO MORAL PRINCIPLES AND THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE. THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE, WHICH DOMINATES IN THOUGHTS OF ETHICAL SOCIALISTS, IS OPPOSED TO ANY UNJUSTIFIED VIOLENCE AND ESPECIALLY TERROR. THIS MEANS THAT THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT IS NOT LEGITIMATE BECAUSE IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH SOME PHILOSOPHICAL REASONABLE AND PREDICTABLE IDEALS, ACCORDING TO NEO-KANTIAN SOCIALISTS, BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S ONLY THE STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE PRACTICAL SITUATION OF THE WORKING CLASS IN THE HISTORICAL PROCESS LEGITIMIZES ITS EXISTENCE AND ITS STRUGGLE WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS. HABERMAS ARGUES THAT MARX FAILED TO SEE A PERSON AS AN AGENT, WHICH MEANS THE BOTH A TOOL-MAKING AND "SYMBOLIZING" THE ANIMALS, THAT IS - LABOR AND LANGUAGE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IN THE SENSE, THAT NONE OF THESE CATEGORIES CANNOT BE REDUCED BY ONE OTHER. IF YOU START TO ARGUE, THEN IT MEANS A RETURN TO THE HEGELIAN - MARXIST "ERROR" AND BELIEVE THAT "JUSTICE WILL INEVITABLY TURNS TO THE EXTENT THAT WHAT SHOULD BE", WHAT HISTORY IS - THE JUDGE AND "HAPPILY APPEARS" ON THE SIDE OF THE PROLETARIAT. IN OUR OPINION WE MUST FIRST DEFINE AND EXPLAIN WHAT IS "PROPER" AND TRUTH, BEFORE CLASS OF PROLETARIAT COULD BE JUSTIFIED. CRITICAL ETHICS IS LOGICALLY PRIOR AND INDEPENDENT OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUCH ETHICS PRESCRIBES THAT ACTUALLY PREACHES "ETHICAL SOCIALISM". THE ARTICLE ALSO MAKES SOME PARALLELS TO UNIVERSAL PRESCRIPTIVISM OF R. M. SOVIET AUTHOR OLEG DROBNICKI WHICH CONSIDERS THAT THEY BOTH TRIED IN SOME SENSE TO UNIFY KANTIAN UNIVERSALISM, HIS MAIN GOAL IS NOT JUST CHANGING CONCEPT OF HISTORICAL MATERIALISM, BUT TO BRING HUMAN DIGNITY TO AGENDA IN SOVIET ETHICS.
339	AS THE MODERN COMMONWEALTH PASSED ITS SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY IN 2009, THE ORGANIZATION'S SLOW-BREWING CRISIS OF RELEVANCE SEEMED DEEPER THAN EVER. NOWHERE WAS THIS MORE APPARENT THAN IN CANADIAN ATTITUDES TOWARD THIS VENERABLE ORGANIZATION. THIS REPRESENTS A STRIKING REVERSAL OF THE PREDOMINANT CANADIAN DISPOSITION THROUGH THE FIRST 50 YEARS OF THE MODERN ERA, WHEN CANADA AND CANADIANS WERE AMONG THE ORGANIZATION'S MOST CONSISTENT SUPPORTERS AND LEADERS. MOREOVER, CANADIANS' ENMESHMENT IN THIS ASSOCIATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND TRANS-SOCIETAL, INVOLVING THE ORGANIZATION'S DYNAMIC WEB OF NONGOVERNMENTAL, AS WELL AS INTERSTATE, FORUMS. THIS VITAL TRANSNATIONAL DIMENSION, REFLECTING A LONG IF CONTESTED COMMON HERITAGE, WOULD SEEM TO PLACE THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE VANGUARD OF CONTEMPORARY MULTILATERALISM, WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON MULTI-LEVEL INTERACTION AND SOCIALITY. YET, IN SOME RESPECTS, THE DECLINE OF THE COMMONWEALTH AS A MULTILATERAL ASSET IS EMINENTLY PREDICTABLE. FOR CANADA, ALONG WITH OTHER COMMONWEALTH MEMBERS, THE ORGANIZATION'S HISTORIC IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY UNDERCUT BY THE GROWING STRENGTH OF REGIONAL MULTILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR CANADA AND A HANDFUL OF OTHERS, THE G8 AND NOW G20 HAVE BECOME TOP PRIORITIES AND FOCI OF DIPLOMATIC ENERGY AND RESOURCES, ERODING THE LOGIC OF CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THE COMMONWEALTH, WHICH IS, BY ANY STANDARD, A LIGHTLY RESOURCED, DIFFUSE, AND UNGAINLY ASSOCIATION. IN THIS LIGHT, TWO KEY QUESTIONS ARISE. FIRST, WHAT HAS BEEN THE COMMONWEALTH'S HISTORIC ROLE IN THE PRACTICE OF CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY? SECOND, WHAT REASONS, IF ANY, CAN BE GIVEN FOR CONTINUING TO INVEST SCARCE RESOURCES IN THIS APPARENTLY DECLINING ASSOCIATION, AND WHAT BASES MIGHT THERE BE FOR RENEWED CANADIAN INTEREST AND ENGAGEMENT? THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT WHILE THE CONTINUATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S SLOW DECLINE AS A CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITY IS LIKELY, IT IS WORTH RESISTING. IF IT CONTINUES, WE WILL LOSE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF GLOBAL SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND UNMATCHED INCENTIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL EMPATHETIC UNDERSTANDING. INDEED, THE VERY FACTORS THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE COMMONWEALTH'S RELATIVE DECLINE UNDERPIN ITS CONTINUED VALUE AS A RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE AND INFORMAL FORUM/COMMUNITY WITHIN WHICH MANY OF THE SALIENT DIVISIONS IN WORLD POLITICS ARE STRADDLED AND ENGAGED. THERE ARE, MOREOVER, AT LEAST SOME BASES ON WHICH A PROCESS OF RENEWAL COULD BE ANCHORED. THE PAPER DISCUSSES TWO: 1) THE OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE ENHANCED RELATIONSHIPS WITH A HANDFUL OF INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT COUNTRIES ( RISING STATES) IN WORLD AFFAIRS-NOTABLY INDIA; AND 2) THE ROLE THE COMMONWEALTH COULD PLAY AS A VEHICLE FOR THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT'S CONSISTENTLY ARTICULATED PRIORITIES OF FOSTERING DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW.
340	THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME (GLOBALIZATION, NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION, SPECIAL MILITARY OPERATION) HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. CLARIFICATION OF THE FEATURES INHERENT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLE OF RUSSIA AT THE CURRENT STAGE, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS STUDY, CAN HELP DEEPEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT CATEGORY AS "CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY", WHICH CONTAINS SIGNS OF BOTH THE UNIVERSAL AND THE ORIGINAL (SPECIAL), DISTINGUISHING THE DOMESTIC STATE FROM OTHERS, WHICH IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE NOW MORE THAN EVER. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY THE FEATURES INHERENT IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CYCLE OF RUSSIA AT THE PRESENT STAGE AS ONE OF THE PATTERNS THAT DETERMINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF RUSSIA AND ITS CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY. THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY IS WORKS MAINLY BY RUSSIAN CONTEMPORARIES DUE TO THE LACK OF EARLIER PUBLICATIONS ON THE ISSUE UNDER CONSIDERATION. A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF IDEAS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLES WAS MADE BY A.N. MEDUSHEVSKY, YU.A. TIKHOMIROV, T.YA. KHABRIEVA, A.YU. BARSUKOV, R.A. ROMASHOV, E.S. ANICHKIN. THE NORMATIVE BASIS OF THE STUDY WAS THE 1993 CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ACTS, AND THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. AS THE MAIN METHODS, THE AUTHOR USES THE FORMAL-LOGICAL ONE, WHICH ALLOWS TO CLARIFY AND GENERALIZE THE OPINIONS OF SCIENTISTS ON THE ISSUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLES; HISTORICAL-LEGAL AND FORMAL-LEGAL METHODS, WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUBSTANTIATION OF THE POSITION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLES IN STATE LAW IN VARIOUS PERIODS OF THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT FORMALLY, WITH THE SAME CONSTITUTION, THE BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLE IS OBSERVED, WHICH CAN BE DEFINED AS A PERIOD OF TIME ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, WITHIN WHICH VARIOUS SIGNIFICANT STATE-LEGAL EVENTS TAKE PLACE. THE AUTHOR CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL CYCLE CAN BE IMAGINED AS A VISIBLE LIMITATION OF INTERNATIONALIZATION, NOT CONFIRMED BY PRACTICE, SINCE UNIVERSAL NORMS ARE ALREADY WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF THE BASIC LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AMONG THEM: A DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL REGIME, THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, A RULE OF LAW STATE, A MULTIPARTY SYSTEM, MARKET ECONOMY, RECOGNITION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS - ALL THIS CREATES SUCH A COMPONENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AS CONSTITUTIONAL UNIVERSALITY - AN ELEMENT THAT COINCIDES WITH OTHER STATES. HOWEVER, CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, WITH VISIBLE PRACTICAL AGGRAVATION, IS NOT YET FORMALLY REFLECTED IN THE BASIC LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN FULL.
341	OVER THE COURSE OF THE LATE EIGHTEENTH, NINETEENTH, AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES, CONGRESS RECEIVED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PETITIONS SEEKING PAYMENT OF PRIVATE CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS OFFICERS. IN RESPONSE, LEGISLATORS ENACTED THOUSANDS OF PRIVATE LAWS FOR THE BENEFIT OF INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS AND CORPORATIONS. IN SOME CONGRESSES, PRIVATE LAWS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL LAWS ENACTED. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS IMPORTANT, BUT LARGELY FORGOTTEN, PRACTICE. THROUGH ITS HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES A SET OF INTERRELATED CONCERNS FAMILIAR TO ALL LIBERAL GOVERNMENTS: TO WHAT DEGREE SHOULD STATUTORY LAW PERMIT THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISCRETION EXISTS, TO WHOM SHALL THE AUTHORITY FOR EXERCISING IT BE ENTRUSTED? ON THE ONE HAND, DISCRETION IS INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE IT THREATENS TO SUBORDINATE THE LAW'S COMMANDS TO THE VENAL WHIMS OF OFFICEHOLDERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, DISCRETION IS AN INDISPENSABLE TOOL FOR ROUNDING OUT THE LAW'S HARD EDGES TO ENSURE JUST OUTCOMES IN INDIVIDUAL CASES. WHILE THIS TENSION IS FAMILIAR, THE MECHANISM THAT EARLY FEDERAL LEGISLATORS ADOPTED TO DEAL WITH IT IS NOT. FOR MUCH OF OUR NATIONAL HISTORY, FEDERAL PRIVATE LEGISLATION THAT IS, CONGRESSIONAL ENACTMENTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS OPERATED AS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR DISPENSING DISCRETIONARY JUSTICE. OUR CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF STATUTORY LAWMAKING, BY CONTRAST, ENVISIONS A PROCESS FUNDAMENTALLY CONCERNED WITH THE PROMULGATION OF GENERAL RULES REFLECTING PUBLIC NORMS. AS THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHOW, THIS UNDERSTANDING DOES NOT CAPTURE SOME INHERENT ASPECT OF LEGISLATION, BUT RATHER IS THE PRODUCT OF A HISTORICAL PROCESS THAT BEGAN WITH A FAR DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF THE PURPOSE OF LEGISLATIVE BODIES. INDEED, FOR MUCH OF THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEGISLATURES DEVOTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT (IF NOT MOST) OF THEIR TIME TO FUNCTIONS THAT APPEAR TO MODERN EYES AS JUDICIAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE IN NATURE: GRANTING PENSIONS, RESOLVING BOUNDARY DISPUTES, AND SETTLING TORT AND CONTRACT CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MANY THOUSANDS OF PETITIONS SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS DURING ITS EARLY HISTORY, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION OF OUR MODERN CONCEPTION OF LEGISLATION. AMONG ITS CENTRAL INSIGHTS IS THAT PRIVATE LAWMAKING, WHILE HARDLY EFFICIENT, CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND THE ARTICULATION OF BROADER LEGAL NORMS. IT DID SO, IN PART, BY HELPING SPAWN A LARGER INTERBRANCH DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW BEST TO SERVE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, ON THE ONE HAND, WHILE DELIVERING JUSTICE TO DESERVING INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS ON THE OTHER.
342	IN NOVEMBER 2014, PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO DRAMATICALLY RESHAPE IMMIGRATION LAW THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE CHANNELS. TOGETHER WITH RELIEF POLICIES ANNOUNCED IN 2012, HIS INITIATIVES WOULD SHIELD NEARLY HALF THE POPULATION OF UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRANTS FROM REMOVAL AND ENABLE THEM TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE EVENTS HAVE DRAWN RENEWED ATTENTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO SHAPE IMMIGRATION LAW. THEY ALSO HAVE REIGNITED A LONGSTANDING CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHETHER CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS EXIST ON A CENTRAL SOURCE OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY: THE POWER TO ENFORCE THE LAW. IN USING THE OBAMA RELIEF POLICIES TO EXPLORE THESE DYNAMICS, WE MAKE TWO CENTRAL CLAIMS. FIRST, IT IS FUTILE TO TRY TO CONSTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT POWER BY TYING IT TO A SEARCH FOR CONGRESSIONAL ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES. CONGRESS HAS NO DISCERNIBLE PRIORITIES WHEN IT COMES TO A VERY WIDE SWATH OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY A REALITY ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR IMMIGRATION LAW TODAY. THE IMMIGRATION CODE HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME INTO A HIGHLY RETICULATED STATUTE THROUGH THE WORK OF NUMEROUS CONGRESSES AND POLITICAL COALITIONS. THE MODERN STRUCTURE OF IMMIGRATION LAW ALSO EFFECTIVELY DELEGATES VAST SCREENING AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT. INTERLOCKING HISTORICAL, POLITICAL, AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OPENED A TREMENDOUS GAP BETWEEN THE LAW ON THE BOOKS AND THE LAW ON THE GROUND. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THERE CAN BE NO MEANINGFUL SEARCH FOR CONGRESSIONALLY PREFERRED SCREENING CRITERIA. FAR FROM REFLECTING A FAITHFUL-AGENT FRAMEWORK, THEN, IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES A TWO-PRINCIPALS MODEL OF POLICYMAKING-ONE IN WHICH THE EXECUTIVE CAN AND SHOULD HELP CONSTRUCT THE DOMAIN OF REGULATION THROUGH ITS INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW AND WHEN TO ENFORCE THE LAW. SECOND, WHEN EXPLORING LIMITS ON THE ENFORCEMENT POWER, WE SHOULD FOCUS NOT ON WHO BENEFITS FROM ENFORCEMENT DISCRETION BUT ON HOW THE EXECUTIVE INSTITUTIONALIZES ITS DISCRETION. THE OBAMA RELIEF INITIATIVES ARE INNOVATIVE: THEY BIND THE EXERCISE OF PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION TO A MORE RULE-LIKE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, CONSTRAIN THE JUDGMENTS OF LINE-LEVEL OFFICIALS BY SUBJECTING THEM TO CENTRALIZED SUPERVISION, AND RENDER THE EXERCISE OF ENFORCEMENT DISCRETION FAR MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC THAN IS CUSTOMARY. THESE EFFORTS TO BETTER ORGANIZE THE ENFORCEMENT BUREAUCRACY ULTIMATELY ADVANCE CORE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES WITHOUT UNDERMINING DETERRENCE OR LEGAL COMPLIANCE, AS SOME CRITICS HAVE WORRIED. MOREOVER, WHILE OUR FOCUS ON DISCRETION'S INSTITUTIONALIZATION REQUIRES CONTEXTUALIZED JUDGMENTS THAT MAY RARELY TRANSLATE INTO CLEAR DOCTRINAL RULES TO GOVERN THE ENFORCEMENT POWER, WE BELIEVE IT IS GENERALLY UNNECESSARY AND UNWISE TO USE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TO LIMIT THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY OVER HOW TO ORGANIZE THE ENFORCEMENT BUREAUCRACY.
343	ADVANCED LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ARE CURRENTLY WITNESSING A BEWILDERING VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN REGIMES OF CONTROL. THESE RANGE FROM DEMANDS FOR EXECUTION OR PREVENTIVE DETENTION OF IMPLACABLY DANGEROUS OR RISKY INDIVIDUALS-SEXUAL PREDATORS, PAEDOPHILES, PERSISTENT VIOLENT OFFENDERS-TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISPERSED, DESIGNED IN-CONTROL REGIMES FOR THE CONTINUAL SILENT AND LARGELY INVISIBLE WORK OF THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL OF RISK. POLITICAL PROGRAMMES OF MIME CONTROL APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE STABILITY, CYCLING RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL THE ALTERNATIVES FROM 'PRISON WORKS: 'SHORT, SHARP SHOCKS' AND 'BOOT CAMPS,' THROUGH 'COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS' AND 'REINTEGRATIVE SHAMING' VIA 'THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATION' TO 'NOTHING WORKS' AND 'THREE STRIKES AND YOU 'RE OUT'. OF COURSE, PROGRAMMES OF CRIME CONTROL HAVE ALWAYS HAD LESS TO DO WITH CONTROL OF MIME THAN THEY HAVE TO DO WITH MORE GENERAL CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MORAL ORDER. AND CONCERNS ABOUT ILLEGALITY AND MIME HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE, BY INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES WHICH ARE NOT PART OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAN BY THOSE THAT ARE CONVENTIONALLY CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF SUCH A 'SYSTEM'. NONETHELESS, EVEN AT THIS MORE GENERAL LEVEL, THINGS SEEM CONFUSING. DESPITE CLAIMS THAT WE LIVE IN A POST-DISCISPLINARY SOCIETY (SIMON), THAT DANGEROUSNESS HAS GIVEN WAY TO RISK (CASTEL), THAT CONTROL IN NOW CONTINUOUS, IMMANENT AND CYBERNETIC RATHER THAN DISCONTINUOUS, LOCALIZED AND INDIVIDUALIZING (DELEUZE), THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE STRATEGIC COHERENCE ABOUT THESE DEVELOPMENTS AT THE LEVEL OF THEIR RATIONALITIES, AND MUCH DIVERSITY AND CONTINGENCY AT THE LEVEL OF THEIR TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PAPER WILL ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE THIS COMPLEXITY ALONG A NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS. IT WILL CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH PARTICULAR 'REGIMES OF ILLEGALITIES' HAVE BEEN INDIVIDUATED AND PROBLEMATIZED, AND SUGGEST THAT, ALTHOUGH THESE ARE DIVERSE, SOME AT LEAST CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS INFRACTIONS OF FREEDOM, THAT IS TO SAY, AS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THEY THROW INTO QUESTION THE VERY PRESUPPOSITIONS OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS, SELF-CONTROL AND SELF-ADVANCEMENT THROUGH LEGITIMATE CONSUMPTION UPON WHICH GOVERNMENTAL REGIMES OF FREEDOM DEPEND. IT WILL CONSIDER THE 'CONCEPTIONS OF THE CRIMINAL' THAT CIRCULATE WITHIN PRACTICES FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ILLEGALITY, AND SUGGEST THAT, DESPITE THE APPARENT DIVERSITY OF THESE CONCEPTIONS-WHERE BIOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS ABOUT INHERITED TENDENCIES COHABIT WITH COMMUNITARIAN ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE VIRTUES-THE PERVASIVE IMAGE OF THE PERPETRATOR OF MIME IS NOT ONE OF THE JURIDICAL SUBJECT OF THE RULE OF LAW, NOR THAT OF THE BIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBJECT OF POSITIVIST CRIMINOLOGY, BUT OF THE RESPONSIBLE SUBJECT OF MORAL COMMUNITY GUIDED-OR MISGUIDED-BY ETHICAL SELF-STEERING MECHANISMS. AND IT WILL CONSIDER THE FORMS OF KNOWLEDGE AND MODES OF EXPERTISE THAT ARE IMPLICATED IN THESE NEW TECHNIQUES AND RATIONALITIES OF CONTROL.
344	ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OF RUSSIAN TAX SCIENCE THAT WE HAVE TO FACE IN PRACTICE IS THE LACK OF CLEAR LEGAL MECHANISMS AND FORMS OF COORDINATION OF ANTINOMIC INTERESTS.THE "BALANCE OF INTERESTS" CONSTRUCT IS USED AS OFTEN AS IT IS UNINTELLIGENT IN LEGAL LITERATURE AND JUDICIAL ACTS. MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED: WHAT EXACTLY IS THE BALANCE OF INTERESTS AND WHAT ARE ITS CRITERIA, HOW IT IS ACHIEVED, WHAT TOOLS AND ALGORITHMS EXIST FOR THIS.THE BALANCING ITSELF IS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPLICIT.BOTH IN THE THEORY OF TAX LAW AND IN PRACTICE, IT IS SOMETHING NEW (TERRA INCOGNITA).DUE TO A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESSENCE OF THE BALANCE AND HOW TO ACHIEVE IT, IN THE ABSENCE OF A DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING AND WEIGHING INTERESTS, TAX HARD CASES ARE RESOLVED MORE INTUITIVELY, BASED ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER'S OWN IDEAS ABOUT WHAT IS DUE. THIS APPROACH DOES NOT ADD LEGITIMACY AND OPENNESS TO JUDICIAL ACTS, AND OFTEN CAUSES MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN THE PROFESSIONAL LAW COMMUNITY.THE PROBLEM OF SUBJECTIVISM CREATES A REAL THREAT OF INFRINGEMENT OF THE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS NOT ONLY OF THE PARTIES TO TAX RELATIONS, BUT ALSO OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL.THE SUBJECT OF THIS STUDY IS THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS A METHODOLOGICAL BASIS FOR ACHIEVING A BALANCE OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INTERESTS IN TAX RELATIONS FIELD.THE AIM OF THE WORK IS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBILITIES OF THE PROPORTIONALITY DOCTRINE HIDDEN FROM THE RUSSIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THEREBY TO ADD RATIONALITY TO THE ISSUE OF ACHIEVING (JUSTIFYING) LEGAL BALANCE IN THE RESOLUTION OF TAX CONFLICTS.WITH THE HELP OF DOGMATIC, COMPARATIVE LEGAL AND OTHER METHODS DEVELOPED BY LEGAL SCIENCE, INSTRUMENTAL POTENTIAL OF PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IS REVEALED.THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING ACHIEVEMENTS OF FOREIGN LEGAL THOUGHT IN THE DOMESTIC THEORY OF TAX LAW AND ADAPTING IT TO PRACTICE OF TAX RELATIONS. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PROPORTIONALITY TEST (THE STRUCTURE OF CRITERION AND THE CONTENT) IN FOREIGN AND RUSSIAN JURISDICTIONS.ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COURT TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE DECISION ARE IDENTIFIED.WITH THE HELP OF A MATHEMATICAL MODEL, A PROBLEM OF THE COMMENSURABILITY OF WEIGHT OF THE VALUE OF INTERESTS, AS WELL AS ISSUE OF FORMALIZATION OF THE PROCESS OF WEIGHING INTERESTS, IS INVESTIGATED; THE CONCEPT OF THE WEIGHT FORMULA PROMOTED BY ROBERT ALEXY IS CRITICALLY EVALUATED.THE ARTICLE ANALYZES APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IN FOREIGN PRACTICE AND IN RUSSIA.IT IS CONCLUDED PRINCIPLE MENTIONED IS THE LEGAL EMBODIMENT OF THE PARETO-OPTIMUM PRINCIPLE.
345	THE CRIME IN ARTICLE 165 IN THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE HAS SOME FEATURES, WHICH GENERATE SOME HARDSHIPS IN THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING AND IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATION INTO CHARGES OF CRIMINAL TRESPASS BY DECEPTION OR BREACH OF TRUST WITHOUT LARCENY. IN LAW LITERATURE MANY AUTHORS, GENERALLY, WRITE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL TRESPASS BY DECEPTION OR BREACH OF TRUST WITHOUT LARCENY FROM THE CLOSELY-RELATED CORPUS DELICTI IS PRESENCE OR LACK OF REAL DAMAGE IN THE RESULT OF WITHDRAWAL AND/OR APPROPRIATION OF THE ALIEN PROPERTY. MATERIALS OF SEPARATE CRIMINAL CASES SHOW THAT MANY DISPUTABLE ISSUES ARISE IN THE PROCESS OF QUALIFICATION OF ILLEGAL ACTS IN THE SOCIAL SPHERE (ILLEGAL OBTAIN OF SUBSIDIES, PENSIONS OR OTHER GRANTS), IN THE SERVICE SPHERE (UNLAWFUL USE OF ELECTRICITY) AND SOME OTHER CASES, WHICH DEMAND SPECIAL STUDY OF THE MECHANISM OF ILLEGAL BEHAVIOUR. AT PRESENT, SCIENTISTS ACTIVELY DISCUSS THE ENACTMENT OF A SPECIAL RULE IN THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR UNLAWFUL USE OF ELECTRICITY, THOUGH OPINIONS OF SCIENTISTS DIFFER IN SOME MAIN POINTS. SOME SCIENTISTS THINK THAT UNLAWFUL USE OF ELECTRICITY SHOULD BE QUALIFIED AS LARCENY; OTHERS THINK THAT IT IS FAULT AND A NEW RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHOR ALSO WRITES ABOUT FALLACIOUS QUALIFICATION OF CASES WHEN A PUBLIC OFFICER ILLEGALLY USES OFFICE CAR BY ARTICLES 165 AND 285 OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE. THERE ARE NO GROUNDS FOR QUALIFICATION OF TAX EVASION BY ARTICLE 165 OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE OR BY ARTICLES 165 AND 198 (199) OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE. UNLIKE THE CASE OF CAR THEFT, CRIMINAL TRESPASS BY DECEPTION OR BREACH OF TRUST WITHOUT LARCENY DOES NOT IMPLY THAT THE OFFENDER STEALS ALIEN PROPERTY. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRIMES IN ARTICLE 165 AND ARTICLE 171 OF THE RUSSIAN CRIMINAL CODE IS THE PRESENCE OR LACK OF ACTS OF SYSTEMATIC CHARACTER CAUSING PROPERTY DAMAGE FOR THE VICTIM AND ILLEGAL ENRICHMENT FOR THE OFFENDER. ON THE BASIS OF ANALYSIS OF THE SPECIAL LITERATURE AND GENERALIZATION OF COURT PRACTICE, THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE THINKS THAT CRIMINAL TRESPASS BY DECEPTION OR BREACH OF TRUST WITHOUT LARCENY HAS THE FOLLOWING FORMS (KINDS): 1) UNLAWFUL USE OF ALIEN PROPERTY; 2) CONSUMPTION OF SERVICE WITHOUT REMUNERATION; 3) APPROPRIATION OF ALIEN PROPERTY INTENDED FOR THE VICTIM; 4) DEFAULT ON LAW OR PROVISION OF A CONTRACT BRINING NON-INCREMENT OF VICTIM'S PROPERTY IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE MARKETS CONDITIONS (ILLEGAL CONVEYANCE OF PASSENGERS OR GOODS BY CONDUCTORS, NON-FULFILMENT OF MANAGERIAL DUTIES, ETC.).
346	THE SUBJECT OF THIS STUDY IS THE LEGAL INSTITUTION OF PATERNITY IN THE SYSTEM OF LAW OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE AIM IS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF THE EXERCISE OF PATERNITY RIGHTS USING MODELING METHODS, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL, FORMAL LEGAL, SYSTEMIC, STATISTICAL METHODS. THE PROBLEM FIELD OF THIS LEGAL INSTITUTION BEGINS ALREADY WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH PROVIDES IT (IN THE FAMILY LAW FIELD) WITH AN EXTREMELY LIMITED BASE, AND THIS LIMITATION IS NOT CURRENTLY FILLED IN BY THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE KEY IN THIS AREA, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROPORTION OF DIVORCED MARRIAGES, IS THE POSSIBILITY OF POST-DIVORCE EDUCATION BY THE FATHERS OF THEIR CHILDREN. DISCRIMINATORY (TO THE FATHERS) JUDICIAL PRACTICE ON DETERMINING THE CHILD'S PLACE OF RESIDENCE IS SUPPORTED, FIRST OF ALL, DUE TO THE ILLEGAL APPLICATION BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF PRINCIPLE 6 OF THE DECLARATION OF RIGHTS OF THE CHILD; HIS AMENDMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHING A HIERARCHY OF CRITERIA TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN CASES OF THIS CATEGORY; AS WELL AS THROUGH THE SELECTION OF COURT CASES OF A CERTAIN ORIENTATION. AT THE SAME TIME, WITH REGARD TO THE SEPARATELY LIVING PARENT, WHO, INSTEAD OF RAISING A CHILD, CAN ONLY CLAIM THE SURROGATE RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM, COURT PRACTICE INTRODUCES THE OBLIGATION TO PROVE THAT SUCH COMMUNICATION WILL NOT HARM THE CHILD. THUS, THE COURTS ACTUALLY INTRODUCE IN ADDITION TO THE THREE ESTABLISHED NEW, NON-STATUTORY FORM OF PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW. IN ADDITION, THE COURTS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE TIME OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE CHILD, REFERRING TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DEPEND SOLELY ON THE ACTIONS OF THE OTHER PARENT LIVING WITH THE CHILD, THEREBY GIVING HIM THE POSSIBILITY OF ABUSE. THE DECISIONS OF THE COURTS ON ESTABLISHING A SCHEDULE OF COMMUNICATION CONTRIBUTE TO THE SAME (THE POSSIBILITY OF ABUSE), MAKING IT DEPENDENT UPON THE PARTICIPATION OF THE PARENT WITH WHOM THE CHILD LIVES (USUALLY MOTHERS) OR ON THE DESIRE OF THE CHILD HIMSELF, WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED CONSIDERABLY BY THE PARENT WITH WHOM HE LIVES. ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACHES ARE ENSHRINED IN THE POSITIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT, AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY LEGAL ONES COMPLYING THE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, ONE SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING AS A GENERAL RULE IN RESOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN PARENTS ABOUT THE CHILD'S PLACE OF RESIDENCE THE MECHANISM OF HIS LIVING ON AN EQUAL FOOTING (THE SO-CALLED "JOINT CUSTODY").
347	XI 42 LMBG EMBODIES THE 70 YEAR OLD RIGHT TO TAKE A COUNTER-SAMPLE IN THE FOOD SECTOR. ACCORDING TO THIS SECTION, A PIECE OF THE SAMPLE (COUNTER-SAMPLE) OR A SECOND SAMPLE HAS TO BE LEFT AT THE PLACE OF CONTROL. THE WAIVER OF LEAVING A COUNTER-SAMPLE IS RESERVED TO THE PRODUCER. THE PURPOSE OF TAKING A COUNTER-SAMPLE OR A SECOND SAMPLE IS TO OBTAIN FURTHER EVIDENCE. TAKING A COUNTER-SAMPLE IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE PRODUCER, THE MERCHANT AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION (CHECKING) IN GENERAL. THEREFORE, THE COUNTER-SAMPLE IS NOT AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE PERSON WHERE IT WAS LEFT. THE FACT OF INFORMING OF LEFT BEHIND COUNTER-SAMPLES OR SECOND SAMPLES AFTER THE EXPIRY OF THE OFFICIAL SEALING TERM, WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE EVIDENCE, OR THE FACT OF NOT INFORMING OF LEFT BEHIND SAMPLES AT ALL RESULTS IN THE EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE (IMPROPERLY OBTAINED) USED IN ANY PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES OR IN ANY CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. ACCORDING TO THE LAW RELATING TO ADMINISTRATIVE OFFENCES AND ACCORDING TO THE CRIMINAL LAW THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW APPLIES FROM THE PROCEDURAL POINT OF VIEW. THEREFORE, THE PRINCIPLE OF HEARING THE INVOLVED PERSONS IS TO BE OBSERVED. THE PRINCIPLE SAYING THAT THE FOOD INSPECTION IN ITS CAPACITY AS PURSUING PUBLIC AUTHORITY MUST INFORM THE POTENTIALLY INVOLVED PERSONS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE OFFICIAL COUNTER-SAMPLE OR SECOND SAMPLE WITHIN THE EXPIRY DATE OF THESE SAMPLES, WAS CONFIRMED BY THE DIRECTIVE 89/397/ECC. THIS DIRECTIVE DATING BACK TO THE YEAR 1989 HAS STILL NOT BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO NATIONAL LAW IN GERMANY. AN INVOLVED PERSON CAN PLEAD FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE DIRECTIVE AS THIS DIRECTIVE HAS DIRECT EFFECT. IN ITS DECISION OF APRIL 10TH 2003 THE EUROPEAN COURT LAYS DOWN THAT THE RIGHT OF SEEKING A COUNTER-OPINION IS AN UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT AND ALSO COMMUNITY LAW, AND THAT THESE RIGHTS OF THE INVOLVED PERSONS ARE RIGHTS FOR THE DEFENSE IN TERMS OF SECTION 6 PARAGRAPH 1 ECHR, AND THAT THE NON-GRANTING OF THESE RIGHTS BY THE AUTHORITIES MAY RESULT IN THE EXCLUSION OF EVIDENCE. S. 42 OF THE DRAFT OF A CODE RELATING TO FOOD AND FEED STUFFS (RECENT VERSION) IS NOT FORMULATED ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIVE 89/397/ECC. IF THE PURSUING PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WILL ENSURE THE RIGHT TO TAKE A COUNTER SAMPLE IS NOT CLEAR AND IT IS THE LANDERS' TASK TO DECIDE ON IT.
348	IN THIS ARTICLE ONE OF COMPONENTS OF METHODOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL PHENOMENA A SYSTEM (SYSTEM AND STRUCTURAL) METHOD AS THE DIRECTION IN METHODOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WHICH CORNERSTONE CONSIDERATION OF OBJECTS AS SYSTEMS WHICH FOCUSES RESEARCHES ON DISCLOSURE OF INTEGRITY OF AN OBJECT, ON IDENTIFICATION IN HIM DIVERSE TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS AND THEIR DATA IN A UNIFORM THEORETICAL PICTURE IS IS ANALYZED. WITHOUT AGREEING WITH OPINION V.M. SYRYKH THAT "THE ATTENTION TO SYSTEM APPROACH AS TO A METHOD OF A RESEARCH WEAKENS AND HE EVEN CASUALLY ISN'T MENTIONED BY A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE AUTHORS WRITING ABOUT PROBLEMS OF A METHOD OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF THE RIGHT", WILL NOTICE THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, SYSTEM (SYSTEM AND STRUCTURAL) APPROACH BY SCIENTISTS IS USED FOR THE SOLUTION OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC TEORETIKO-LEGAL PROBLEMS. NOTING THE POTENTIAL OF THIS METHOD FOR THE SOLUTION OF VARIOUS POLITICAL AND LEGAL PROBLEMS, IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT AS COMPLETE SYSTEM EDUCATION, HAVING A HIERARCHICAL ORDER, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE WAYS OF INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS USED FOR EXPLANATION OF TRUE WILL OF THE LEGISLATOR, I.E. THE SYSTEM OF UNIFORM RECEPTIONS AND RULES BY MEANS OF WHICH THE CONTENTS OF LEGAL INSTRUCTIONS ARE ANALYZED, THE SENSE OF ALL COMPONENTS OF RULE OF LAW AND THE REGULATORY LEGAL ACT IN GENERAL AND OTHER ACTS OF LAW-MAKING (CONTRACTS OF NORMATIVE CONTENT, STANDARD JUDGMENTS) IS REVEALED. IGNORING OF THIS OR THAT WAY OF INTERPRETATION WITH INEVITABILITY CAN LEAD TO NOT TRUE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WILL OF THE LEGISLATOR AND, EVENTUALLY, TO VIOLATION OF LEGALITY. IT IS CLAIMED THAT A SET OF THESE OR THOSE WAYS OF INTERPRETATION NEEDS TO BE APPLIED CONSISTENTLY, OBSERVING THE SEQUENCE ESTABLISHED BY JURISPRUDENCE. IN OTHER WORDS, HERE IT IS ABOUT APPROPRIATE LEVELS AT WHICH CERTAIN WAYS OF INTERPRETATION OF THE RIGHT HAVE SETTLED DOWN. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR, THE SEQUENCE OF WAYS OF INTERPRETATION OF RULES OF LAW HAS TO BE SUCH: GRAMMATICAL, LOGICAL, SPECIAL AND LEGAL - WAYS WHICH INVESTIGATE THE LEGISLATIVE TEXT IN WHICH THE INTERPRETED NORM IS EXPRESSED; SYSTEMATIC - OPERATES WITH MATERIALS OF OTHER NORMS, THE SYSTEM OF THE RIGHT IN GENERAL; HISTORICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL - INFORMATION SOURCES, EXTERNAL IN RELATION TO LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ATTENTION ON NOT ONLY THE THEORETICAL, BUT ALSO PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSIDERED PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SOLUTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS CONCERNING SYSTEM APPROACH OF INTERPRETATION EXPLANATION OF THE RULES OF LAW CONSIDERED IN THIS SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE WILL PROMOTE RATIONALIZATION OF INTERPRETATIVE ACTIVITY OF THE LAWYER, EFFICIENCY OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY, LEGAL REGULATION IN GENERAL, TO STRENGTHENING OF LAW AND ORDER AND MODE OF LEGALITY IN THE COUNTRY IS PAID.
349	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE CONSIDERATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE PECULIARITIES OF LEGAL PROPAGANDA AS A DIRECTION OF ACTIVITY OF THE SOVIET PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE BODIES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1980S DURING THE PERIOD OF THE PERESTROIKA OF THE SOVIET STATE. THIS WORK HAS BEEN WRITTEN ON THE BASIS OF DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS OF THE STATE ARCHIVE OF THE PSKOV REGION, WHICH CONTAIN REPORTS ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PSKOV REGION PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE ON THE LEGAL PROPAGANDA OF SOVIET LEGISLATION AND THE LEGAL EDUCATION OF RESIDENTS OF THE REGION. THE MAIN ATTENTION IN THE ARTICLE IS DRAWN TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES OF LEGAL EDUCATION AND UPBRINGING OF RESIDENTS OF THE PSKOV REGION DURING THE YEARS OF THE PERESTROIKA. AMONG THESE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES, THE AUTHOR OF THIS PUBLICATION PRIMARILY DISTINGUISHES: READING THEMATIC LECTURES, PARTICIPATING IN THE WORK OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES OF LEGAL KNOWLEDGE, PUBLISHING SPECIAL MATERIALS IN THE PRINT MEDIA, SPEAKING ON RADIO AND TELEVISION, ETC. THE WORK FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT SOVIET CITIZENS DID NOT ALWAYS VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROSECUTION AUTHORITIES RELATED TO LEGAL PROPAGANDA (ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TOOK PLACE AFTER WORK HOURS, WHICH MEANS THEY "TOOK" FROM PEOPLE THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR REST AND COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY OR ANY OTHER ENTERTAINMENT). OFTEN PEOPLE WERE SIMPLY FORCED TO ATTEND THESE KINDS OF EVENTS (LECTURES, THEMATIC EVENINGS, READER CONFERENCES, ETC.), AS WELL AS STUDYING AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND LEGAL KNOWLEDGE FACULTIES, AS THIS WAS REQUIRED BY THE PARTY AND HIGHER AUTHORITIES. THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE ALSO NOTES THAT FOR THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1980S IT WAS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN THE WORK ON LEGAL EDUCATION OF CITIZENS OF THE SOVIET STATE, INCLUDING THROUGH CLOSER BUSINESS INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTERACTION WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT DURING THE PERESTROIKA, EMPLOYEES OF THE PROSECUTION AUTHORITIES OF THE PSKOV REGION PROPAGATED AND ANALYZED NEW LAWS, TALKED ABOUT THEIR WORK TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW, HELPED TO EDUCATE THE POPULATION IN THE SPIRIT OF AN ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP, INTOLERANCE OF ANY, EVEN INSIGNIFICANT, OFFENSE. AT THE SAME TIME, ON THE ONE HAND, THIS ACTIVITY OF THE PROSECUTION AUTHORITIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF SOVIET MAN INTO AN INDIVIDUAL OPEN TO EXTERNAL CONTROL BY THE SOVIET STATE AND THE PARTY, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF SOVIET SOCIETY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 1980S.
350	ACCORDING TO POINT 5 H. 1 OF ART. 1127 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (FURTHER THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) ARE EQUATED TO NOTARIZED WILLS OF THE WILL OF THE CITIZENS WHO ARE IN IMPRISONMENT PLACES CERTIFIED BY THE CHIEF OF IMPRISONMENT PLACES. IN ORDER TO APPLY THIS RULE OF LAW IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY, IT IS NECESSARY, AT LEAST, TO KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATOR MEANS BY "PLACE OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY". HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT DISCLOSE THIS CONCEPT, IN OTHER CURRENT RUSSIAN LEGISLATION THERE IS ALSO NO LEGAL DEFINITION OF "PLACE OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY". THE CRIMINAL EXECUTIVE CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION DOES NOT FILL THIS GAP EITHER. ACCORDING TO PART 1 OF ARTICLE 73 OF THE CRIMINAL EXECUTIVE CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (HEREINAFTER PEC OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) CONVICTED TO IMPRISONMENT SERVE SENTENCE IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. PART 1 OF ARTICLE 74 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE LISTS THE TYPES OF CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INDICATING THAT CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE CORRECTIONAL COLONIES, EDUCATIONAL COLONIES, PRISONS, MEDICAL CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ANALYZING THESE RULES, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE PLACE OF DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY ARE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH CITIZENS SERVING SENTENCES SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT. IN THIS CASE, THE LEGISLATOR WOULD HAVE TO ADJUST THE PROVISIONS OF THE CIVIL LEGISLATION TO BRING THE PROVISIONS OF THE CIVIL CODE AND THE PENAL ENFORCEMENT CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OTHER, DESPITE THE FACT THAT CHAPTER 3 OF THE CIVIL CODE, WHICH INCLUDES ARTICLE 1127, HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADED RELATIVELY RECENTLY AND INTRODUCED WITH EFFECT FROM 01 MARCH 2002. IN PARTICULAR, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO AMEND PARAGRAPH 5 OF PART ONE OF ARTICLE 1127 OF THE CIVIL CODE, OUTLINING THIS PARAGRAPH DIFFERENTLY: FOR EXAMPLE, "EQUAL TO NOTARIZED WILLS OF THE WILL OF CITIZENS IN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS, CERTIFIED BY THE HEAD OF THESE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS." MEANWHILE, THIS APPROACH, IN OUR OPINION, IS SIMPLIFIED AND DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS A WHOLE. THUS, ARTICLE 74 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE REFERS TO CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS NOT ONLY CORRECTIONAL COLONIES WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF REGIME, EDUCATIONAL COLONIES, PRISONS, MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT, IN SOME CASES, OTHER INSTITUTIONS. THUS, WE SUGGEST TO ADD POINT 5 OF PART 1 OF ARTICLE 1127 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, HAVING STATED IT IN THE FOLLOWING EDITION: "ARE EQUATED TO NOTARIZED WILLS OF THE WILL OF THE CITIZENS WHO ARE IN PLACES OF DETENTION, THE LIST OF WHICH IS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATION, CERTIFIED BY THE HEAD (CHIEF) OF THE PLACE OF DETENTION, HIS DEPUTY OR THE PERSON REPLACING HIM."
351	THIS CONTRIBUTION STEMS FROM A WORKSHOP ON FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF CRIMINAL LAW. THIS MAY RAISE EXPECTATIONS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE CORE BUSINESS OF WHAT IS CALLED SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW: THE STRUCTURE OF CRIME, THE CONCEPT OF INTENTION, COMPLICITY AND PARTICIPATION, ATTEMPT AND PREPARATION; ACTS AND OMISSIONS; OR CAUSATION. HOWEVER, MOST PUNITIVE SANCTIONS-ESPECIALLY FINES-CONCERN REGULATORY OFFENSES THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT BY SUCH MORAL NOTIONS AS CULPABILITY AND WRONGFULNESS, WHILE THE APPLICABLE BURDEN OF PROOF DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN THE CASE OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES. THIS RAISES THE QUESTIONS OF HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REGULATORY AND CRIMINAL OFFENSES IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH REGULATORY OFFENSES (SHOULD) FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WILL BE DERIVED FROM AN EXPLORATION OF THE HISTORICITY OF CRIMES AND REGULATORY OFFENSES, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE (MODERN) STATE. I WILL START OFF WITH TRACING THE EMERGENCE OF CONTRAVENTIONS AND CRIMINA IN THE COURSE OF THE EARLY AND LATE MIDDLE AGES AND THE SUBSEQUENT ADVENT OF A DOMAIN OF "POLICE" AT THE THRESHOLD OF MODERNITY NEXT TO THE ALREADY EXISTING DOMAIN OF "JUSTICE." AFTER THIS THE STRICT SEPARATION OF THE DOMAINS OF "POLICE" (COVERING POLIZEIDELIKTEN) AND "JUSTICE" (COVERING VERBRECHEN AND VERGEHEN) IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY GERMANY WILL BE DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP OF BOTH DOMAINS TO DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE RECHTSSTAAT AND THE ETAT DE DROIT. THE MAIN ARGUMENT WILL BE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRIMINAL AND REGULATORY OFFENSES IN ESSENTIALIST TERMS, SUCH AS THE MEDIEVAL MALUM IN SE AND MALUM PROHIBITUM, DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. BUILDING ON A NONESSENTIALIST DIFFERENCE I WILL SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENTIAL PROCEDURAL CONSTRAINTS SHOULD BE BASED ON PRAGMATIC ARGUMENTS, WHICH, HOWEVER, DO NOT EQUATE WITH UTILITARIAN ARGUMENTS. IN LINE WITH PHILOSOPHICAL PRAGMATISM THE SEPARATION OF MEANS AND END THAT CHARACTERIZES UTILITARIANISM IS REJECTED AND REPLACED BY A PRAGMATIC APPROACH GROUNDED IN THE NORMATIVE POSITION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY IN THE SENSE OF AN ETAT DE DROIT OR A SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RECHTSSTAAT. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE AIM OF PUNISHING REGULATORY OFFENSES IS TO SUSTAIN AN EFFECTIVE DOMAIN OF "POLICE" UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, MEANING THAT THE PUNISHMENT OF REGULATORY OFFENSES WILL HAVE TO BE REGULATED BY THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT INFORM THE "FAIR TRIAL." THIS WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO IMPOSE PUNITIVE SANCTIONS TO PREVENT AND RETALIATE VIOLATIONS OF SPECIFIC LEGAL NORMS, WHILE ENABLING CITIZENS TO CONTEST THE INCRIMINATED VIOLATION AS WELL AS THE LAWFULNESS OF THE VIOLATED LEGAL RULE.
352	THE EDUCATION OF CITIZENS IS THE BASIS FOR THE STATE DEVELOPMENT. THIS SPHERE OF LEGAL RELATIONS IS DIFFICULT FOR SUPERVISORY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING VIOLATIONS AND ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS DUE TO THE SPECIFICS OF EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IMPLEMENTATION, AN INCOMPLETENESS OF LEGISLATIVE REGULATION, AND A DISTRIBUTION AND COMBINATION OF SUPERVISORY POWERS, WHICH ARE VESTED WITH AUTHORIZED ORGANIZATIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAINTAINING LATENCY IN VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW IN THIS SPHERE OF LEGAL RELATIONS, WHICH LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT VIOLATIONS OF RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF A PERSON AND A CITIZEN IN OBTAINING EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OF VARIOUS LEVELS. FOR A HIGH-QUALITY FUNCTIONING OF THE COUNTRY'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, IT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVE WORK OF THE STATE-LEGAL MECHANISM FOR PROTECTING CITIZENS' RIGHTS TO EDUCATION (SLM). THE RESULTS OF STUDYING THE MATERIALS OF THE PROSECUTOR'S PRACTICE INDICATE THAT STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS (LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES) ARE OFTEN UNAWARE OF VIOLATIONS OF THEIR RIGHT TO EDUCATION; THEREFORE, COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM THEM USUALLY REFER TO ISSUES FROM THE FIELD OF RELATED ACTIVITIES OF AN EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY DO NOT HAVE QUESTIONS OF CONTENT AND EDUCATIONAL NATURE SINCE THEY LACK KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY FOR ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES PROVIDED AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF STUDENTS INDEPENDENTLY OR BY INITIATING PROTECTION BY AUTHORIZED BODIES. THE RESULTS OF THE PROSECUTORS' SURVEY INDICATE THAT THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LEGISLATION REQUIREMENTS ON THE CONTENT OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES BY EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WAS NOT ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE OBJECT OF PROSECUTORIAL INSPECTIONS. THUS, DURING PROSECUTORIAL INSPECTIONS, CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL QUALITY ISSUES WERE INVESTIGATED ONLY IN 15% OF THE CASES OF INSPECTIONS IN SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES (TECHNICAL SCHOOLS) (WHEN CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS IN KINDERGARTENS AND UNIVERSITIES, THIS GROUP OF ISSUES WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SUBJECT OF THE INSPECTION AND, ACCORDINGLY, WAS NOT INVESTIGATED). SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBTAINED ON THE ISSUE OF ATTRACTING SPECIALISTS TO CONDUCT PROSECUTORIAL INSPECTIONS. ONLY IN 15% OF INSPECTIONS IN SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES (TECHNICAL SCHOOLS), SPECIALISTS WERE INVOLVED TO PROVIDE EXPERT AND ANALYTICAL ASSISTANCE. WHEN CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS IN KINDERGARTENS AND UNIVERSITIES, SPECIALISTS WERE NOT INVOLVED. DURING THE SAMPLE SURVEY, PROSECUTORS REFER TO THE FACT THAT INSPECTIONS ON THESE ISSUES ARE WITHIN THE COMPETENCE OF THE FEDERAL SERVICE FOR SUPERVISION IN EDUCATION AND SCIENCE (ROSOBRNADZOR). BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH, THE CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE SLM ARE REVEALED, THE PRINCIPLES OF ITS FORMATION AND FUNCTIONING ARE FORMULATED. THROUGH THE DISCLOSURE IN THE ARTICLE OF THE CURRENTLY EXISTING PROBLEMS IN THIS SPHERE OF LEGAL RELATIONS, THE NEED FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF SLM IS CONSISTENTLY JUSTIFIED.
353	THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF 17 OCTOBER 1992 ON THE MUTUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE INSTITUTIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND ON LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, CALLED POPULARLY THE SMALL CONSTITUTION, IS THE THIRD CONSTITUTIONAL ACT IN POLAND'S MODERN HISTORY CHARACTERIZED BY A LIMITED SCOPE OF REGULATION AND TEMPORARY (PROVISIONAL) NATURE. THE ONE AND A HALF YEAR PERIOD OF PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF THE ACT WAS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF SHAPING THE CONCEPT OF A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROCESS WAS TO DEPART FROM THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIFORMITY OF POWER AND ON FORMAL SUPREMACY OF THE SEJM, AND TO STRIVE TO BUILD THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. ANOTHER IMPORTANT BACKGROUND OF THIS COURSE OF ACTION WAS THE PROTRACTED WORK ON A COMPREHENSIVE AND NEW BASIC LAW. THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF 17 OCTOBER 1992 CONTAINED THE PROVISIONS CONCERNING MOSTLY THE SEJM, THE SENATE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT. ITS ADOPTION HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO REPEAL THE CONSTITUTION OF 1952, HOWEVER SOME PROVISIONS OF THE LATTER WAS CONTINUED IN FORCE. SO, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE SMALL CONSTITUTION (COMPOSED OF 78 ARTICLES) WAS IN EFFECT TOGETHER WITH 62 ARTICLES OF THE CONSTITUTION OF 1952 CONTINUED IN FORCE. MOREOVER, THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF 23 APRIL 1992 GOVERNING THE PROCEDURE FOR WORK ON A NEW BASIC LAW WAS IN FORCE.. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE SMALL CONSTITUTION OF 1992 INCLUDE: THE TRIPARTITE DIVISION OF POWERS; REGULATION OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF POWER ON THE BASIS OF MECHANISMS TYPICAL OF THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT (PARTICULARLY A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE); THE ENHANCED STATUS OF A DEPUTY AND SENATOR; IMPROVED AND MODERNIZED LEGISLATIVE AND BUDGETARY PROCEDURES; ALTERED POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC (PARTICULARLY BY INTRODUCING THE REQUIREMENT OF COUNTERSIGNING); STRENGTHENING THE POSITION AND INCREASING AUTONOMY OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTER AND PRIME MINISTER. HIGH POLITICAL TENSIONS, IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN PRESIDENT LECH WALCSA AND THE SEJM, AS WELL AS IMPERFECTION OF ADOPTED REGULATIONS, HAS CAUSED THAT THE PRACTICE OF APPLICATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACT OF 17 OCTOBER 1992 WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FREQUENT DISPUTES ON COMPETENCE, AS WELL A APPLICATIONS BEING ADDRESSED TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL. AS A TRANSITIONAL ACT, THE SMALL CONSTITUTION WAS IN FORCE FROM DECEMBER 1992 TO OCTOBER 1997. NEVERTHELESS, MANY ITS SOLUTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONCERNING THE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OF POWER WERE MAINTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND OF 2 APRIL 1997.
354	PURPOSE NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE IS BECOMING AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE ERA OF COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE AS A FRAMEWORK IS LIMITED TO THE POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT OF ROMANIA AND TO CREATE A CONNECTION BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE THROUGH OPERATIONALIZING THE CONCEPTS AND CLARIFYING THEIR INTER-DEPENDENCY. NEW PUBLIC LEADERSHIP SKILLS ARE REQUIRED FROM BOTH HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL APPROACHES, IN ORDER TO TACKLE THE COUNTRY'S WICKED PROBLEMS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THROUGH THE USE OF QUALITATIVE METHODS, SUCH AS DOCUMENT ANALYSIS OF COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM REPORTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON ROMANIA, AND EXPERT INTERVIEWS WITH A FOCUS ON GOVERNANCE ASPECTS, THE PAPER SEEKS TO CLARIFY THE CHALLENGES THAT ROMANIA FACES IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATIZATION GIVEN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTEXT. FINDINGS FINDINGS IN ROMANIA REVEAL LITTLE AGREEMENT ON PROGRESS IN GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, PROGRESS HAS BEEN NOTED ON VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE AUTHORS DISCUSS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT THE CONCEPT OF GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS CREATED FROM AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS' PERSPECTIVE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND DEFINE THE GOOD GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A MEANS OF BRINGING GOVERNANCE CLOSER TO THE COMPLEX AND CHANGING CONTEXT OF EACH COUNTRY. THE PAPER AIMS TO CLARIFY THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE, BY ASSESSING CONTEXTUAL FACTORS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY ARE RELATED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS PAPER TO INFORM OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ADHERE TO NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE. THE PAPER HAS IMPLICATIONS IN PROPOSING THE USE OF THE GOOD GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A HELPFUL CONCEPT WHEN CONSIDERING DEMOCRATIC FRAMEWORKS FOR RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PAPER ARE CONNECTED TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND SOCIAL CONTEXT OF THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN REGION AND ITS COMPONENT COUNTRIES. IMPROVING DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES, THROUGH ADVANCING THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IN SWITCHING TO A PUBLIC GOVERNANCE PERSPECTIVE IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, IS THE MAIN OUTCOME OF NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE-STYLE REFORMS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER'S ORIGINALITY STANDS IN DESIGNING THE PREMISES FOR THE "GOOD GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE" AS A NEW CONCEPT THAT AIMS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND NEW PUBLIC GOVERNANCE, AND BRING MORE CONCEPTUAL CLARITY. BEING SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE, THROUGH THE USE OF PRIMARY DATA GENERATED BY EXPERT INTERVIEW ANALYSIS, THE NEW CONCEPT CAN IMPROVE AND ENCOURAGE FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC.
355	TODAY, THE RISK MANAGEMENT OF BUDGET CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS IS GREATER THAN EVER. THE PROCESS OF CHANGE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, RESULTING IN E-GOVERNMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SCIENTIFIC PAPER IS TO SEE WHETHER BUDGETARY CHALLENGES HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF E-GOVERNMENT IN COMPLEX FINANCIAL SYSTEMS BASED ON FACTORS F1, F2, F3, F4, AND F5: LACK OF INFORMATION, LACK OF COOPERATION, LACK OF RESOURCES AND REDUCTION OF FOCUS, LACK OF BUDGET EXPERTS AND FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND SHORTCOMINGS AND INCONSISTENCIES DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MANAGE RISKS FROM BUDGETARY CHALLENGES BY FOCUSING ON A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVE E-GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE IN COMPLEX FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WAS BASED ON THREE KEY ISSUES: AN APPROACH TO E-GOVERNMENT, ANALYZING WHICH VARIABLES NEED MORE ATTENTION TO RISK, AND LEARNING HOW TO MEET BUDGETARY CHALLENGES TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE DURING GOVERNANCE. FOR THIS STUDY, THE DATA WERE CONDUCTED BY KOSOVO'S PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, MORE SPECIFICALLY AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL (MINISTRY OF FINANCE) AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL (38 MUNICIPALITIES OF KOSOVO). A TOTAL OF 38 QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ANALYZED AND DIVIDED INTO THREE SESSIONS, WHICH WERE ANALYZED THROUGH THREE ANALYSES, SUCH AS FACTOR ANALYSIS, DATA RELIABILITY ANALYSIS, AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS, USING SPSS VERSION 23.0 FOR WINDOWS. THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED OVER THE YEARS 2017, 2018, 2019, AND 2020, WHILE THE ANALYSIS INVOLVED SEVERAL PROCESSES, WHERE SOME OF THE FACTORS WERE REMOVED IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MODEL ACCEPTABLE. IN THIS CASE, 21 VARIABLES WERE TESTED AND DIVIDED INTO 5 FACTORS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THESE FACTORS TO REDUCE BUDGETARY CHALLENGES AND INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE OF E-GOVERNMENT IN COMPLEX FINANCIAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS (A) LACK OF RESOURCES (STAFF, FUNDS, INFRASTRUCTURE, TOOLS, ETC.), (B) INCREASING THE FOCUS ON RISK MANAGEMENT EVEN AFTER THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS FROM THE MINISTRY TO THE MUNICIPALITY, (C) THE SELECTION OF PROGRAMS BASED ON PRIORITIES AND NOT ON THE BASIS OF WISHES AND POLICIES, (D) HAVING POLITICAL STABILITY, RULE OF LAW, AND MORE CONTROL, AND (E) HAVING REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES FROM THE PRACTICES OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE OPINIONS OF BUDGET EXPERTS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PAPER HAVE TO DO WITH ONLY A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF VARIABLES, WHICH WERE TAKEN IN THE STUDY AS WELL AS ONLY IN THE MUNICIPALITIES OF KOSOVO. IN THIS CASE, FOR OTHER ANALYSES BY OTHER RESEARCHERS, OTHER VARIABLES CAN BE ANALYZED IN OTHER COUNTRIES BY MAKING COMPARISONS.
356	AT PRESENT, THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES IN THE TAX-LEGAL REGULATION SHOULD ENSURE NOT ONLY THE BALANCING OF BUDGETS THROUGH TAX REVENUES, BUT ALSO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FAIR CONDITIONS FOR DOING BUSINESS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IN TURN, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY REQUIRES THE DEFINITION OF UNIFIED AND UNDERSTANDABLE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CONSISTENT RULES OF TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY DISCRIMINATORY TAXATION CONDITIONS. EACH STATE, AT THE LEVEL OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION, ESTABLISHES THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE THE STARTING BASELINES THAT MUST BE EMBODIED IN EACH NORM OF THE TAX LAW. PRINCIPLES ARE THE DEFINING CATEGORY FOR THE "TAXATION" INDICATOR, WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DOING BUSINESS RATING. THEREFORE, THE IMPACT OF TAX LAW PRINCIPLES ON DOING BUSINESS IN UKRAINE IS EVIDENT. IN THIS REGARD, THE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF TAX LAW PRINCIPLES ON AN EXAMPLE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF STABILITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION IS EXTREMELY RELEVANT FOR BUSINESS ENTITIES. THEY GAIN SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THEY GUARANTEE THE QUALITY OF THE TAX LAW, RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF TAXPAYERS. THEREFORE, THE ARTICLE PROVES THAT TAX LEGISLATION SHOULD BE HIGH-QUALITY, ACCESSIBLE AND CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THAT IS, TO ENABLE TAXPAYERS TO ANTICIPATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS IN PRACTICE. ON THE EXAMPLE OF THE LAWS OF UKRAINE NO. 1797-VIII OF 21.12.2016 AND NO. 1989-VIII DATED MARCH 23, 2017, THE IMPORTANCE OF OBSERVANCE OF THE TAX LEGISLATION AS REGARDS THE STABILITY OF TAX REGULATION, EQUALITY OF TAXPAYERS, AND THE BALANCE OF INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS AND SOCIETY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN GENERAL. AS A RESULT, IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE, AND ALL CHANGES TO THE LAW AND ORDER ESTABLISHED BY THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE SHOULD BE OBJECTIVE, REASONABLY GROUNDED AND AIMED AT ACHIEVING THEIR LEGITIMATE AIMS. THE DISCRIMINATORY AND UNSTABLE TAX SYSTEM RESULTS IN VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF ECONOMIC ENTITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES, AND THUS AN OBSTACLE TO THE PROPER CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN UKRAINE. AS A RESULT, IT IS PROPOSED TO FORESEE IN THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE THE RIGHT OF TAXPAYERS NOT TO APPLY NORMS THAT CONTRAVENE THE PRINCIPLES OF TAX LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH AN INEXHAUSTIBLE LIST OF DISCRIMINATORY FEATURES, TO EXTEND THE PRINCIPLE OF STABILITY TO ALL WITHOUT EXCEPTION OF THE NORMS OF THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE.
357	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE PECULIAR FEATURES OF THE OFFICIAL AND ORDINARY INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW IN THE COGNITIVE ASPECT (IN TERMS OF LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATIONISM). A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE OF ORDINARY INTERPRETATION IS VARIABILITY OF UNDERSTANDING AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MEANING OF LEGAL TEXTS AND TERMS DETERMINED BY OBJECTIVE LINGUISTIC FACTORS AND INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RECIPIENT. IN THE PROCESS OF INTERPRETING THE ORDINARY NATIVE SPEAKER HAS TO DEAL WITH A KIND OF FUNCTIONAL JURIDICAL VERSION OF THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AS AN INDEPENDENT SUBSYSTEM. LEGAL LANGUAGE CANNOT BE TRANSLATED INTO THE ORDINARY RUSSIAN LANGUAGE BY AN ELEMENTARY WAY - BY SPONTANEOUSLY GENERATED CODES EXISTING IN ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS. THE SPECIAL QUALITY OF LEGAL LANGUAGE IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLISION BETWEEN ANTINOMIAN EXISTENCE OF NATURAL LANGUAGE, NATURAL LAWS OF ITS EXISTENCE, SEMANTIC NETS OF LINGUISTIC UNITS AND IMPERATIVE LEGAL TEXTS AND RIGID SEMANTIZATION OF LINGUISTIC UNITS USED IN LEGAL LANGUAGE. THIS LEADS TO THE FACT THAT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW BY ORDINARY NATIVE SPEAKERS DOES NOT ALWAYS CORRESPOND TO THE LEGAL IDEA LAID DOWN IN THE TEXT OF THE LAW BY THE LEGISLATOR WITH POTENTIAL COMMUNICATIVE FAILURES AS A CONSEQUENCE. THE POSSIBILITY AND THE DEGREE OF COMMUNICATIVE FAILURE ARE MAGNIFIED WHEN THE LEGAL TEXT AND THE LEGAL TERM AS ITS COMPONENT ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY COMBINED BY SPECIAL AND ORDINARY SEMANTIC COMPONENTS. COINCIDENCE OF ORDINARY WORDS WITH THE SPECIFIC TERMS CAUSES DIFFICULTIES FOR THEIR PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING BY ORDINARY NATIVE SPEAKERS, BECAUSE THE IDEAS TYPICAL TO ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS DO NOT AMBIGUOUSLY MATCH SPECIALIZED PRESUMPTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE CONTENT OF THE TERM MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE MIND OF THE RECIPIENT WITH A VARIOUS DEGREE OF FULLNESS OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM, ITS ACCURACY AND DEPTH. IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION, CONTEXT, TYPES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND LEVELS OF THE PREPARATION OF THE SUBJECT OF INTERPRETATION. AT THE SAME TIME PERLOCUTIONARY EFFECT OF REAL FUNCTIONING OF LEGAL TERMS IN THE ORDINARY CONSCIOUSNESS OF RUSSIAN NATIVE SPEAKERS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR - INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATOR. ON THE BASIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA THE ARTICLE HAS EXAMPLES SHOWING THAT THE ORDINARY INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TERMS IS CHARACTERIZED BY PLENTY OF VERSIONS OF INTERPRETATION WHICH DO NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH THEIR OFFICIAL ONES. WE CAN DISTINGUISH TWO TRENDS OF THE ORDINARY INTERPRETATION: 1) A WORD IN THE MIND OF THE NATIVE SPEAKER HAS MORE MEANINGS THAN REGISTERED IN LEGAL DICTIONARIES; 2) THE NUMBER OF MEANINGS REGISTERED IN DICTIONARIES IS RICHER THAN IN THE LINGUISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS. FURTHERMORE, THE STRUCTURE OF THE SEMANTEME DIFFERS - THE HIERARCHY OF NUCLEAR AND PERIPHERAL MEANINGS.
358	FORMATION OF LIBERAL IDEOLOGY IN RUSSIA BEGINS LONG BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE AT THE HISTORIC ARENA OF THE COUNTRY SOCIO-POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF LIBERALISM. CONSIDERATION OF THE ORIGINS AND MILESTONES OF RUSSIAN LIBERALISM SHOWS THAT HE HAD HAD ITS OWN HISTORY AND THEORY, SUBSTANTIAL PARADIGMATIC TRAITS AND CHARACTERISTICS. SOME ASPECTS OF THE RUSSIAN LIBERAL CLASSICAL DOCTRINE IS SIMILAR TO WESTERN EUROPE, SOME ARE COMPLETELY ORIGINAL CHARACTER. LAST REFLECT THE SPECIFICS OF THE HISTORICAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF POST-REFORM RUSSIA XIX-EARLY XX CENTURIES. ONE OF THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF RUSSIAN CLASSICAL LIBERALISM LIES IN ITS INTELLECTUAL CHARACTER. WE CAN STATE THAT IN DETERMINING RUSSIAN LIBERALISM WAS THE IDEA OF THE PRIMACY OF HUMAN FREEDOM. ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING OF FREEDOM, TO DETERMINE THE UNDERSTANDING OF CIVIL LIBERTY AND LIBERALS DEMAND THE CREATION OF A LEGAL GOVERNMENT ORDER IN WHICH THE VALUE OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE MEASURED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT COULD NOT BE REDUCED TO ANY ARBITRARY LEGISLATOR, NOR TO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. ITS BASIS IS THE NATURAL RIGHT TO LIFE AND FREEDOM. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF FREEDOM FROM A LEGAL POINT OF VIEW WAS RELATED TO THE POLITICAL PROGRAM OF THE LIBERALS - THE REQUIREMENTS OF FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE, TRANSPARENCY AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURT AND THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, UNHINDERED PRIVATE INITIATIVE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, THE INVIOLABILITY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, ETC. ALL OF THESE TENETS, ENSHRINED IN A SYSTEM OF POSITIVE LAW, CONSTITUTE WHAT IS CALLED CIVIL LIBERTIES. THEY FORM THE BASIS OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY AND ARE ITS ULTIMATE VALUE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VIEWS CONTAINED ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTION WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE CIVIL RIGHTS GUARANTEED TO ALL PEOPLE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES OF GROWTH OF MATERIAL WELFARE, THUS FREEING INTELLIGENCE FOR CREATIVITY AND CULTURAL CREATION. POLITICAL FREEDOMS - THE CONTINUATION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND IN A SENSE, THEY COMPLEMENT AND WARRANTY. RUSSIAN LIBERALISM, THEREFORE, WILL NEVER TAKE HIS ECONOMICS AND POLITICS FROM THE RIGHT. HOWEVER, RUSSIAN LIBERALS HAVE INSISTED ON THE PRIMACY OF LAW TO POLITICAL POWER. BEING IN THE MAJORITY OF LAWYERS ARE DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW RULE AS THE HIGHEST VALUE AMONG THE NORMAL PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT. CONSISTENTLY UPHOLDING THE PRIORITY OF THE RIGHT, LIBERALS TIED IT UP WITH THE IDEA OF A STRONG STATE, ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THE NECESSARY REFORMS TO ENSURE ORDER IN THE COUNTRY. HENCE THEIR ATTENTION TO THE IDEA OF STATEHOOD, EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE CONCEPT OF LEGAL STATEHOOD.
359	THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION RESULTED IN A LARGE SCALE OF LEGAL REFORM BEING UNDERTAKEN IN THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS. ALL AREAS OF SOCIAL LIFE WERE SUBJECT TO GLOBAL CHANGES. THE PRONOUNCEMENT OF PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, MARKET ECONOMY AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS MADE IT NECESSARY TO REFORM THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THUS, THE PROCESS OF LEGAL TRANSFORMATION HAS BEEN STARTED. THE PARTICIPATION OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND EXPERTS HAS BECOME A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THIS HISTORICALLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN THE SOCIETY. THE GENERAL EXPERIENCE OF LEGAL COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND EXPERTS AFFORDS A DETERMINATION OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IN THIS FIELD: COMPETITION BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEMS AND COMPETITION BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS AND EXPERTS. THE SUCCESS OF REFORMS DEPENDS VERY MUCH ON EFFECTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE COORDINATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND EXPERTS. THE COORDINATION SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY STATE INSTITUTIONS IN THE RECIPIENT COUNTRIES. ONGOING REFORM IN GEORGIA HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LAWYERS FROM THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM TO EFFECTIVELY COOPERATE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONTINENTAL EUROPEAN LEGAL FAMILY. THE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORM HAS DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF BILATERAL, MULTILATERAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION. THE RESULTS OF LEGAL COOPERATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE LARGER PROCESS OF LEGAL TRANSFORMATION. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS, PUBLICATIONS OF LEGAL LITERATURE (TEXTBOOKS, COMMENTARIES, ETC.) AND TRAINING OF JURISTS (JUDGES, ATTORNEYS, EDUCATORS). EXPERIENCES WITH LEGAL REFORM HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO LOOK TO THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE LAWS. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM, PARTICULARLY JUDICIAL REFORM, REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT PRECONDITION FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAWS. ONE OF THE GOALS OF JUDICIAL REFORM IN GEORGIA HAS BEEN THE STRENGTHENING OF THE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY BY ABOLISHING THE RELICS OF THE SOVIET LAW SUCH AS THE SUPERVISORY POWER OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OVER THE COURTS, CANCELLATION OF FINAL COURT DECISIONS AND NORMATIVE DIRECTIVES BEING ISSUED BY THE SUPREME COURTS. THE ONGOING LEGAL REFORM IN THE FORMER SOVIET COUNTRIES HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY VARIOUS INCORRECT EXPECTATIONS AND EVALUATIONS CONCERNING THE FAILURE OR SUCCESS OF REFORM. LEGAL REFORM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A LONG PROCESS. IT IS NOT YET FINISHED. THE LAW IS A PHENOMENA OF THE CULTURE AND EDUCATION OF A SOCIETY. THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL REFORM REQUIRES STRENGTHENING OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL EDUCATION AND LEGAL STUDIES.
360	A REFLECTION ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IS NOW BOTH POSSIBLE AND USEFUL. THE PAPER ASSESSES THE JUDICIAL REACTION TO THE NATIONAL AND EU MEASURES INTRODUCED FOR CONTAINING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. THE FOCAL POINT OF ANALYSIS IS THE INTENSITY OF REVIEW AND THE JUDICIAL JUSTIFICATIONS GIVEN DURING THAT PERIOD. THE WORKING HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE JURISPRUDENCE IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE UTILIZATION OF THE 'CRISIS VOCABULARY', BY THE APPLICATION OF A LOW INTENSITY REVIEW YARDSTICK, BY THE APPLICATION OF A NARROWER IN SCOPE VERSION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY AND BY THE WIDE MARGIN OF DISCRETION RECOGNIZED FOR THE DECISION-MAKER. THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDES THAT THE JURISPRUDENCE WAS NOT UNIFORM; SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATIONS EXIST BOTH IN APPROACH AND IN THE IMPACT OF THE RELEVANT CASE LAW ON THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL ORDER. THE COURTS ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN THOSE OF MEMBER STATES AND SUPRANATIONAL COURTS (CJEU AND ECTHR). THE CJEU APPROACHED THE MATTER IN JURISDICTIONAL TERMS AND FORMALISTICALLY, THUS PLACING THE BURDEN ON THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS. THE STRASBOURG COURT APPLIED THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION DOCTRINE, THUS LIMITING REVIEW TO CASES WHERE THE IMPACT OF THE LEGISLATIVE MEASURES RESULTED IN DANGER TO SURVIVAL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NATIONAL COURTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER 'LENDERS' (GERMANY) OR 'BORROWERS' (GREECE, PORTUGAL AND CYPRUS). A MORE ROBUST CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW CAN BE FOUND IN THE GERMAN EXAMPLE, WHILE IN THE CASE OF 'BORROWERS' THE NATIONAL COURTS FACED A MORAL AND EXISTENTIAL DILEMMA. THE RESULT WAS THAT CRISIS LAWS WERE APPROACHED AS REQUIRING LIGHT REVIEW, THUS TRANSFORMING NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS AND UNSETTLING THE EQUILIBRIUM OF CONSTITUTIONAL COEXISTENCE. NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS WERE TRANSFORMED AND THE COURTS WERE PLACED IN THE IMPOSSIBLE POSITION OF ADJUSTING CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW TO THE ECONOMIC NEEDS. DURING THE CRISIS, PRAGMATISM BECAME THE NEW NORM.
361	BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND SOUTH AFRICA (BRICS) NATIONS ACCOUNT FOR ONE-QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S LAND AREA, HAVING MORE THAN 40% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION, AND ONLY ONE-QUARTER OF THE WORLD GROSS NATIONAL INCOME. HENCE THE STUDY AND REVIEW OF WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN BRICS NATIONS IS OF RELEVANCE. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED FROM THE LITERATURE THAT THERE ARE STUDIES AVAILABLE COMPARING TWO OR THREE COUNTRY'S WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT STATUS, WHILE THE STUDY ENCOMPASSING THE BRICS NATIONS CONSIDERING IN A SINGLE FRAMEWORK IS SCANT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE EXISTING WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND STATUS OF COMPLIANCE TO BASEL CONVENTION IN THE BRICS NATIONS, NOTING POSSIBLE LESSONS FROM MATURED SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THOSE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION EU) AND USA. THE STUDY INTRODUCED A NOVEL FRAMEWORK FOR A WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT MAY BE ADOPTED IN BRICS NATIONS AND REVEALED THAT BRICS COUNTRIES HAVE MANY SIMILAR TYPES OF CHALLENGES. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIED SOME SIGNIFICANT GAPS WITH RESPECT TO THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND TRANS-BOUNDARY MOVEMENT OF WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, WHICH MAY ATTRACT RESEARCHERS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.
362	ARE STATES WILLING TO OVERLOOK HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS TO REAP THE FRUITS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION? EXISTING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS OFTEN THE CASE: SECURITY, DIPLOMATIC, OR COMMERCIAL GAINS MAY TRUMP HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE BY PARTNERS. WE ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT CRIMINAL-JUSTICE COOPERATION MIGHT BE OBSTRUCTED WHEN IT UNDERMINES CORE VALUES OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, SINCE THE BREACH OF THESE VALUES EXPOSES THE COOPERATING STATE TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL RESISTANCE AND BACKLASH. TO TEST OUR ARGUMENT, WE EXAMINE EXTRADITION: A CRITICAL TOOL FOR ENFORCING CRIMINAL LAWS ACROSS BORDERS, BUT ONE THAT POTENTIALLY THREATENS THE RIGHTS OF SURRENDERED PERSONS, WHO COULD FACE PHYSICAL ABUSE, UNFAIR TRIAL, OR EXCESSIVE PUNISHMENT BY THE FOREIGN LEGAL SYSTEM. WE FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR THEORETICAL EXPECTATION THROUGH STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SURRENDER OF FUGITIVES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS WELL AS SURRENDERS TO THE UNITED STATES: GREATER RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS CORRELATES WITH THE SURRENDER OF FEWER PERSONS. A CASE STUDY OF BRITAIN CONFIRMS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS MAY AFFECT THE WILLINGNESS TO EXTRADITE. OUR FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR DEBATES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND FOREIGN POLICY AS WELL AS THE FIGHT AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL CRIME.
363	IN INDIA, THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A US$22.6 BILLION FINANCIAL SUPPORT PACKAGE FOR THE POOR AND MARGINALIZED AS A RESULT OF COVID-19. APPROXIMATELY US$ 4.2 BILLION (INR 310 BILLION) CAME FROM A VAST PILE OF UNSPENT SOCIAL SPECIAL-PURPOSE FUNDS. HOW AND WHY DID SUCH A LARGE VOLUME OF FUNDS ACCUMULATE IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND WHY DID IT TAKE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY TO RELEASE THEM? WHAT MIGHT BE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR USE UNDER SUCH EMERGENCY CONDITIONS - ESPECIALLY FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOCIAL WELFARE PROVISION? THIS PAPER PRESENTS A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF TWO PRELIMINARY CASE STUDIES OF SPECIFIC SOCIAL SPECIAL-PURPOSE FUNDS IN INDIA. WE RELY ON A HANDFUL OF UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS, TRADE UNION REPRESENTATIVES, AND LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT BEGAN IN JANUARY 2020, AND WHICH WERE PURSUED VIRTUALLY FOLLOWING THE LOCKDOWN. THIS IS BOLSTERED BY ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING COMPTROLLER AND AUDITOR GENERAL OF INDIA (CAG) REPORTS, RELEVANT LAWS, AND CONTEMPORARY PRESS COVERAGE. WE ARGUE THAT NON-DISBURSEMENT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A INSTITUTIONAL MATTER, AND NOT ONLY AS TECHNICAL OR IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE. MOREOVER, AS SUCH FUNDS ARE LIKELY TO MUSHROOM FOLLOWING COVID-19, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD FOCUS ON THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, DECISION-MAKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES FOR THE FLOW AND DISTRIBUTION OF COVID FUNDS, RATHER THAN MERELY EMPHASISING THEIR COLLECTION.

364	GREEN INNOVATION HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT DRIVING FORCE FOR CHINA'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS PAPER SELECTS THE 2010-2020 PROVINCIAL-LEVEL REGIONS IN CHINA AS SAMPLES, AND ADOPTS A MULTI-INDICATOR COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION METHOD TO COMPREHENSIVELY, OBJECTIVELY AND SCIENTIFICALLY EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY OF AIR POLLUTION IN TWO DIMENSIONS: NATURAL RESOURCE ENDOWMENT AND HUMAN ACTIVITY IMPACT, AND ALSO MEASURES AND CALCULATES THE GREEN INNOVATION IN EACH PROVINCE, CITY AND AUTONOMOUS REGION TO EXPLORE THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF GREEN INNOVATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY AND ITS SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT; IT ALSO EXPLORES THE HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF GREEN INNOVATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY UNDER DIFFERENT POLLUTION ENVIRONMENTS. THE CONCLUSIONS SHOW THAT: (1) GREEN INNOVATION HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY. (2) THERE IS A SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECT OF GREEN INNOVATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY. IN OTHER WORDS, IN AREAS WITH HIGHER PM2.5 CONCENTRATION, THAT IS, LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, GREEN INNOVATION HAS A WEAKER ABILITY TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY; IN AREAS WITH LOWER PM2.5 CONCENTRATION, THAT IS HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, GREEN INNOVATION HAS A STRONGER ABILITY TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY. (3) IN THE PROCESS OF GREEN INNOVATION AFFECTING ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY, PM2.5 PLAYS THE PART OF A MEDIATING EFFECT, INDICATING THAT GREEN INNOVATION IS AN INTERMEDIATE TRANSMISSION MECHANISM AFFECTING ENVIRONMENTAL CARRYING CAPACITY, AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE SHORT-TERM INDIRECT EFFECT IS GREATER THAN THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE SHORT-TERM DIRECT EFFECT, AND THE LONG-TERM DIRECT EFFECT IS GREATER THAN THE LONG-TERM INDIRECT EFFECT.
365	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ILLUSTRATE VARIOUS PITFALLS WHICH MUST BE DEALT WITH BEFORE AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT MAY BEGIN TO FUNCTION, IE BEFORE IT CREATES A LEGAL OBLIGATION UPON A CONTRACTING STATE. THE CZECH REPUBLIC IS, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, AN APPROPRIATE EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THIS, FOR VARIOUS REASONS, AS IT IS AN EU MEMBER STATE WITH A (PREVAILING) PARLIAMENTARY FORM OF GOVERNANCE AND A (RATHER COMPLEX) BICAMERAL PARLIAMENT. IN THE FIRST PLACE, THE AUTHORS DEAL WITH THE HISTORICAL AND COMPARATIVE CONTEXT OF THE RATIFICATION PROCEDURE OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. SINCE THIS PROCEDURE IN EVERY COUNTRY INVOLVES THE INTERPLAY OF SEVERAL BODIES, A PROPER EVALUATION OF THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT MAY HELP IN THE INTERPRETATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION, WHICH IS RATHER BRIEF IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS OF THE RATIFICATION PROCEDURE, WHICH THE AUTHORS ADDRESS, IS THE ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC IN THE PROCEDURE OF THE RATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. ON THE BASIS OF THE HISTORICAL AND THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION, THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE COMPETENCE OF THE PRESIDENT RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE HIS/HER PREROGATIVE. THE PRESIDENT'S ACT OF RATIFICATION IS, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THE FORMAL CONCLUSION OF AN INTERNAL CONSULTATION PROCEDURE ON AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. IN EXERCISING THIS COMPETENCE, THE PRESIDENT IS ENDOWED WITH A VERY LIMITED MARGIN OF DISCRETION. THE AUTHORS FURTHERMORE MAKE A COMPARATIVE STUDY BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE CIRCULATED VIA THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR PARLIAMENTARY RESEARCH AND DOCUMENTATION ON THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT, PARLIAMENT AND THE HEAD OF STATE IN THE RATIFICATION PROCEDURE OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. THE MAIN PART OF THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH SELECTED PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS OF THE NEGOTIATION PROCEDURE OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND THE PRACTICE OF APPLICATION (NAMELY THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, THE CLASSIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, REPEATED SUBMISSIONS OF THE PROPOSAL ON THE EXPRESSION OF CONSENT WITH THE RATIFICATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY BY CHAMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, SIMPLIFIED PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL FOR THE RATIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL TREATIES, AND THE CONCEPT OF RATIFICATION). THE ARTICLE ENDS WITH BRIEF OBSERVATIONS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL TREATIES CONCLUDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION OR THE UNION TOGETHER WITH THE MEMBER STATES, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO INCREASE.
366	THE THEORY OF THE OBJECTIVE IMPUTATION FROM THE PARADIGM OF THE PROTECTION OF LAWS TURNS OUT TO BE A SOLID AND ADEQUATE TOOL AIMED AT GUARANTEEING THE LEGALFIELDS OFFREEDOM PROMOTED BY OUR FUNDAMENTAL LAW, WHILE BEING SUBJECT TO PROHIBITION ONLY THOSE EXTERNALIZED AND PUBLIC DECISIONS OF ACTION THAT IMPLY THE DISTURBING ARROGATION OF AN EXTERNAL FIELD OF ORGANIZATION, NOT THOSE PRIVATE CONDUCTS OR THAT, ONCE EXTERNALIZED, BECOME IRRELEVANT. THUS, IT CONTRIBUTES TO STRENGTHENING THE PRINCIPLES THAT, AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME DEFINED BY OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY OF 1853, SET THE BASIS FOR CONSIDERING THE CRIMINAL MATTER AS A KEY ASPECT OF THE STATE PUBLIC ORDER, INSOFAR AS REFLECTING THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE OF VALUES THAT DEFINE AN OPEN OR LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
367	COUNTER-REVOLUTION BY LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND - POPULISM AS A DISTINCTIVE POLITICAL PROJECT THAT MOBILISES ANTI-LIBERAL CONSERVATIVE FORCES IN SOCIETY - POPULIST ATTEMPT TO DISMANTLE LIBERAL-CONSTITUTIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE NAME OF A CONSERVATIVE, ILLIBERAL PROJECT - POPULIST CRITIQUE OF LEGAL FUNDAMENTALISM, UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXCESS OF LIBERAL LEGAL NORMS, AS A KEY DIMENSION IN THE CONSERVATIVE, POPULIST PROJECT
368	U.S. FORCES ABROAD HAVE OFTEN FACED COMPLAINTS ABOUT CRIMES COMMITTED BY TROOPS, YET WE LACK SYSTEMATIC QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ON SUCH CRIMES. BASED ON NEWLY DISCOVERED DATA COMPILED BY THE ARMY, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED PICTURE OF AMERICAN TROOPS' CRIMINAL ACTIVITY WORLDWIDE DURING THE COLD WAR (1954-1970). THE DATA SHOW THAT TROOPS ENGAGED IN SIGNIFICANT CRIMINALITY, WITH A PARTICULARLY HIGH RATE OF VIOLENT CRIME-HOMICIDE, RAPE, AND ROBBERY-AND A RELATIVELY LOW RATE OF PROPERTY CRIME. HOST COUNTRIES TREATED OFFENDING TROOPS LENIENTLY: PRISON SENTENCES WERE RARE, AND THEY AVERAGED LESS THAN 2 YEARS IN DURATION. THE DATA PRESENTED HERE HOLD FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN U.S. FORCES AND HOST COUNTRIES AND THE LEGACY OF U.S. MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS.
369	THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT ON CHILDCARE USE IN NIGERIA, UTILIZING INFORMATION FROM FIVE ROUNDS OF THE NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEYS. THE ANALYSIS MADE USE OF BOTH BINARY AND MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT WOMEN WHO SHARE HOUSEHOLD CHOICES WITH THEIR SPOUSES WERE MORE LIKELY TO UNDERTAKE POSTNATAL CARE FOR THEIR BABIES IN EITHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC HOSPITALS COMPARED TO SELF-MEDICATION/OTHERS/TRADITIONAL. ALSO, WOMEN WHO OWNED HOUSES AND THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INCLINED TO USE POSTNATAL SERVICES FOR BABIES IN HEALTH FACILITIES. BY IMPLICATION, WOMEN EMPOWERMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN IMPROVING CHILDCARE SERVICES IN NIGERIA. THIS SUGGESTS THAT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN, WOMEN'S INPUTS IN HOUSEHOLD DECISION-MAKING SHOULD BE ACCOMMODATED, WHILE EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO ENHANCE HOUSEHOLD SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION, AND SUPPORT MOTHERS TO HAVE FORMAL EDUCATION. THE FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT PROMOTING WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN INCREASING THE DEMAND FOR FORMAL CHILDCARE SERVICES.
370	AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY OBSTRUCTIVE FACTORS FOR MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE, THE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHIPS HAS RESULTED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPENSATION FUNDS, SUCH AS THE OIL SPILL LIABILITY TRUST FUND OF THE UNITED STATES, SHIP OIL POLLUTION FUND OF CANADA AND INTERNATIONAL OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND (IOPC). FREQUENTLY SUFFERING FROM MARINE OIL POLLUTION, CHINA HAS EXTENDED CONSIDERABLE EFFORT IN MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 'GREEN PRINCIPLE' INTO THE CIVIL CODE, CHINA ATTACHED INCREASING SIGNIFICANCE TO THE LEGISLATION INCLUDING COMPENSATION FOR OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHIPS. CHINA FORMALLY ESTABLISHED A COMPENSATION FUND IN 2012, AND THE PAST DECADE HAS WITNESSED THE BURGEONING DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE SHIP-SOURCE OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND (CSOPC), IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL DEFECTS WHICH IMPEDE THE FUND FROM ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. AS A NATIONAL FUND THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE IOPC, THE CSOPC ADOPTS SEVERAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE DISTINCTIVE FROM INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PRACTICE; FOR INSTANCE, NOT RECOGNIZING PURE ECONOMIC LOSS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF COMPENSATION. SUCH UNIQUE PARAMETERS, THOUGH PARTIALLY ORIGINATING FROM THE NATIONAL CONDITIONS IN CHINA, HAVE RESULTED IN GLARING DEFECTS, INCLUDING INCOMPLETE COMPENSATION SCOPE AND INAPPROPRIATE COMPENSATION MEASURES. GIVEN THE ABOVE PROBLEMS, THIS STUDY ENDEAVOURS TO PROVIDE SEVERAL LEGAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MACRO POLICIES FOR IMPROVING THE TOP-LEVEL DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM, ENHANCING OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION CAPABILITIES, AND PROMOTING THE INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS. THE STUDY PROPOSES TWO POTENTIAL REGULATORY PATHS FOR INNOVATION; NAMELY, ENLARGING THE RANGE OF COMPENSATION AND ESTABLISHING AN ESSENTIAL EMERGENCY FUND. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE VICTIMS OF OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE AND SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC INTERESTS OF THE OCEAN, THIS STUDY PUTS FORWARD RELEVANT LEGAL SUGGESTIONS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROVING THE COMPENSATION SYSTEM FOR OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE CAUSED BY SHIPS IN CHINA AND PROMOTING THE GOVERNANCE OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT.
371	CHAPTER 7 OF THE HISTORY COURSE A NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY OF NORTHERN EURASIA IS TITLED "THE LONG EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AND THE RISE OF MODERNIZING EMPIRE." IN THE COURSE OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE NEWLY FOUNDED RUSSIAN EMPIRE HAD CONSUMED ALMOST THE ENTIRE REGION LOOSELY DEFINED AS NORTHERN EURASIA, FROM THE FAR EAST TO THE BALTICS. IT CONQUERED AND ANNEXED FORMER RIVAL REGIONAL POWERS, THE POLISH-LITHUANIAN COMMONWEALTH AND CRIMEAN KHANATE, AND BECAME THE SOLE, OVERWHELMING POLITICAL FORCE IN PLACE OF THE HITHERTO DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM OF POLITIES. THIS BROUGHT ABOUT AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION: THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL AND CULTURAL SELF-ORGANIZATION OF THE "AHISTORICAL" REGION OF NORTHERN EURASIA BECAME LARGELY CONFINED TO THE BORDERS OF ONE POLITICAL ENTITY. THE STRUCTURAL "IMPERIAL SITUATION" OF OVERLAPPING AND CONTESTING LOCAL CULTURES, SOCIAL HIERARCHIES, AND REGIMES OF DIFFERENCE COINCIDED WITH AN ACTUAL EMPIRE. FROM THEN ON, THE STABILITY OF THE IMPERIAL REGIME BECAME CONDITIONED BY ITS ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE AND RATIONALIZE SPONTANEOUS SELF-ORGANIZATION PROCESSES OF THE SOCIETIES AND CULTURES THAT IT HAD INCORPORATED. THIS PREDETERMINED THE SYSTEMATICALLY REFORMIST AND MODERNIZING CHARACTER OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE REACTIONARY POLITICAL VIEWS OF SOME OF ITS RULERS: ONLY CONSTANT CUSTOMIZATION OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORDER SUSTAINED THE LEGITIMACY OF THE REGIME IN THE EYES OF VARIOUS SOCIAL ELITES. PART 2 OF THE CHAPTER, "FROM A MODERN STATE TO A MODERN EMPIRE," PICKS UP THE STORY FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY, WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE IDEAL MODEL OF A CAMERALIST (MODERN) STATE DID NOT EQUALLY FIT A SMALL GERMAN PRINCIPALITY AND THE VAST AND HETEROGENEOUS RUSSIAN EMPIRE. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE VERY MEANING OF EMPIRENESS IN RUSSIA WAS PROBLEMATIZED: EQUALLY ALIEN TO ALL NATIVE POLITICAL TRADITIONS OF THE REGION (INCLUDING THE MUSCOVITE ONE), EMPIRE LACKED A CLEAR GOAL AND CULTURAL IDENTITY THAT FRUSTRATED EVEN THE MEMBERS OF ITS RULING ELITE. THE INITIALLY SPONTANEOUS IMPROVISATIONAL SEARCH FOR DISTINCTIVELY IMPERIAL PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT BECAME SELF-CONSCIOUS ATTEMPTS AT SOCIAL ENGINEERING UNDER CATHERINE II. MOTIVATED BY THE IDEAS OF ENLIGHTENMENT (FIRST OF ALL, BY THE WRITINGS OF MONTESQUIEU), CATHERINE EMBARKED ON AN AMBITIOUS MISSION TO PROVE THAT AN EMPIRE CAN BE REFORMED INTO A MODERN STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. HER FAILURES AND SUCCESSES OWED AS MUCH TO HER ABILITIES AS A RULER AND HISTORICAL CIRCUMSTANCES, AS TO THE MERITS AND MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE IDEAS THAT MOTIVATED HER. EVENTUALLY, SHE PRODUCED A DISTINCTIVELY IMPERIAL DESIGN OF THE MODERN STATE, AND A NEW VISION AND IDEOLOGY OF A MODERNIZING EMPIRE THAT WOULD LAST FOR ANOTHER CENTURY. IN THE STRUCTURALLY IMPERIAL SITUATION, BY SOLVING SOME PROBLEMS, THE LEGISLATOR UNWITTINGLY CREATED NO LESS SERIOUS NEW ONES, WHICH MADE CONSTANT REFORMISM A BUILT-IN COMPONENT OF THE ENTIRE CONSTRUCTION.
372	THIS ARTICLE MAKES A SIMPLE CLAIM THAT HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR DECADES AND YET HAS ENORMOUS THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF COUNSEL ADOPTED BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN GIDEON V. WAINWRIGHT ACCRUES LARGELY TO THE BENEFIT OF MEN. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT ORIGINAL DATA ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATING THAT MILLIONS OF WOMEN FACE COMPULSORY AND HIGHLY PUNITIVE ENCOUNTERS WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT DO SO LARGELY IN THE CIVIL COURTS, WHERE NO RIGHT TO COUNSEL ATTACHES. THE DEMOGRAPHIC PICTURE THAT EMERGES IS ONE IN WHICH THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL SKEWS HEAVILY AGAINST WOMEN'S INTERESTS. AS THIS ARTICLE SHOWS, THE GENDERED ALLOCATION OF THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL HAS INDIVIDUAL AND SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCES THAT PLAY AN UNDERAPPRECIATED ROLE IN PERPETUATING RACIAL AND GENDER INEQUALITY.WE REVISIT WELL-KNOWN DOCTRINE, AND, IN CONTRAST TO ALL PRIOR LITERATURE, WE PLACE GENDER AT THE CENTER OF THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE ON THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL. LIBERTY PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN PARAMOUNT IN THE COURT'S OPINIONS, BUT THE LIBERTY INTERESTS OF WOMEN HAVE BEEN DEVALUED. IN LASSITER V. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES, THE COURT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE TERMINATION OF A BLACK MOTHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HER CHILD AS DESERVING THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL. PRIOR SCHOLARS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE GIDEON COURT AIMED TO PROTECT BLACK MEN FROM ABUSES OF STATE POWER BUT PROTECTING BLACK WOMEN FROM SUCH ABUSE IS NOWHERE IN THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE.SINCE LASSITER, THE COURT HAS REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE A CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF REPRESENTATION FOR CIVIL DEFENDANTS WITH FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS AT STAKE, AND, WE ARGUE, AVAILABLE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE LARGEST CATEGORIES OF THESE CASES-FAMILY LAW, EVICTION, AND DEBT COLLECTION-DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT BLACK WOMEN. AS WE SHOW, THE GENDERED DEPRIVATION OF A RIGHT TO COUNSEL RELEGATES WOMEN TO A SECONDARY LEGAL STATUS AND IMPINGES ON THE FUNCTIONING OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. DRAWING ON THE EXAMPLE OF HOUSING DEPRIVATION, A HIGHLY VISIBLE COLLATERAL EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC, WE ILLUSTRATE HOW LAWYERLESS DEFENDANTS ARE NOW THE NORM IN THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM, WITH WOMEN MOST SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS. FIRST, IN THE ABSENCE OF GOVERNMENT-APPOINTED COUNSEL, WOMEN'S INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARE ROUTINELY TRAMPLED. POWERFUL GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE ADVERSARIES OF THESE WOMEN HAVE CAPTURED THE CIVIL COURTS, WITH THE RESULT THAT JUDGES REGULARLY FAIL TO ENFORCE EVEN WELL-ESTABLISHED LAW. SECOND, WITHOUT LAWYERS, APPEALS ARE SCARCE, AND THE LAW FAILS TO EVOLVE IN AREAS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO WOMEN'S LIVES. THIRD, WOMEN'S ABILITY TO ACT IN THE WORLD, PROTECTED BY THE RULE OF LAW, HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY COMPROMISED BY LACK OF ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION, RESULTING IN WOMEN'S ENTRENCHED SUBORDINATION. FINALLY, WITHOUT LAWYERS TO SERVE AS WATCHDOGS IN THE CIVIL COURTS, CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE HAS RENDERED WOMEN'S MOST IMPORTANT LEGAL PROBLEMS INVISIBLE. THIS HAS UNDERMINED OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY THE SYSTEM'S SHORTCOMINGS AND AGITATE FOR REFORM.
373	WITH RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) HAS FOUND WIDESPREAD APPLICATIONS IN VARIOUS FIELDS. ONE NOTABLE AREA IS AUTONOMOUS DRIVING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS REVOLUTIONIZING HUMANVEHICLE INTERACTIONS AND TRAFFIC REGULATIONS. IN MANY COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY CHINA, AUTONOMOUS DRIVING TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING FIELD TESTS AS IT REACHES A MATURE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, ALONGSIDE TECHNICAL PROGRESS, THIS TECHNOLOGY PRESENTS SEVERAL CHALLENGES TO EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS. INTRODUCING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADS NECESSITATES ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING ROAD TRAFFIC SAFETY. THIS CALLS FOR COMPREHENSIVE REVISIONS, SPANNING FROM NATIONAL LEGISLATION TO LOCAL ENFORCEMENT, AND FROM INDEPENDENT REGULATIONS TO GRADUAL CHANGES IN LAWS. THE EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS NEED TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE FUTURE CHALLENGES POSED BY AUTONOMOUS DRIVING TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA.
374	THE AUTHOR MAKES AN ASSUMPTION THAT ANY TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION CANNOT PROPERLY BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT ITS HISTORICAL, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXTS. THEREFORE, HE PRESENTS IN DETAIL THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF WORK ON A CONSTITUTION OF DEMOCRATIC POLAND, STARTING WITH THE DEBATES OF THE ROUND TABLE. IN THIS RESPECT, HE DISTINGUISHES THREE STAGES OF SYSTEMIC TRANSFORMATIONS, DELINEATED BY SUCCESSIVE TERMS OF PARLIAMENT: FIRST STAGE PRIOR TO THE FIRST PARTIALLY DEMOCRATIC ELECTION WHEN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC WAS CHANGED, THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC ELECTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WAS INTRODUCED AND NEW ACT ON ELECTIONS TO THE SEJM AND THE SENATE WAS ADOPTED; THE SECOND STAGE-THE PERIOD OF FUNCTIONING OF THE "CONTRACTUAL PARLIAMENT" WHEN THE NAME OF THE STATE WAS RESTORED AND IDEOLOGICAL PHRASES ABOUT THE ALLIANCE WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND THE LEADING ROLE OF THE PUWP WERE DELETED FROM THE BASIC LAW, AND THE PROVISION STATING THAT POLAND IS A DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE WAS INTRODUCED TOGETHER WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSAL ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT; THE THIRD STAGE-THE FUNCTIONING OF A PARLIAMENT CHOSEN IN A FULLY DEMOCRATIC ELECTION, WHEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ACTS WERE ADOPTED, INCLUDING: THE ACT ON MUTUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE EXECUTIVE POWER OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND AND THE LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT (THE SO-CALLED SMALL CONSTITUTION) AND ON THE PROCEDURE FOR THE PREPARATION AND ADOPTION OF A CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND; THE FOURTH STAGE-THE PERIOD OF FUNCTIONING OF A PARLIAMENT ELECTED IN 1993, WHEN THE (1997) CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND WAS ADOPTED. IN THIS HISTORICAL CONTEXT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE AN UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE DATE OF ESTABLISHMENT OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC OF POLAND. THE AUTHOR MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC OF POLAND IS ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY THE SPRIT OF COMPROMISE. THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPROMISE WHICH MOTIVATED WORK ON A DRAFT OF A BASIC LAW, HAS MOSTLY GIVEN POLAND'S CONSTITUTION AN ECLECTIC SHAPE. THE SLOGAN OF CONSTITUTIONAL COMPROMISE HID A CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PURPOSES OF THE THEN LEADING BLOC, I. E. THE PROTECTION OF INTERESTS OF THE POST-COMMUNIST FORMATION. CONCESSIONS MADE BY THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION TO WIN THE REQUIRED MAJORITY OF VOTES, CONCERNED MATTERS (IN THEIR VIEW) OF MINOR IMPORTANCE. THE COMING INTO FORCE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC OF POLAND MEANT AN ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GOAL DECLARED BY ITS PROMOTERS, WHICH WAS A DEFINITIVE CONFIRMATION OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND CLOSING HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS WHICH DATE BACK TO THE PERIOD OF THE POLISH PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC.
375	THE ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE ARGUMENTS AND COUNTER-ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE ON THE INFLUENCE OF STATE ADMINISTRATION ON INNOVATIONS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY MANAGEMENT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. THE MAIN GOAL OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH IS TO FORM AND PROVE A HYPOTHESIS REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHODOLOGICAL TOOLKIT FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY ON THE DIVERGENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY SUBINDEX OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF LITERARY SOURCES AND APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF THE ROLE OF STATE ADMINISTRATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FORMATION OF INNOVATIONS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY MANAGEMENT PROVED THAT ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY ON THIS TOPIC. THE URGENCY OF SOLVING THIS SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR FINDING ADDITIONAL DETERMINANTS OF INFLUENCE ON THE LEVEL OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR THE FURTHER POSSIBILITY OF HARMONIZING DOMESTIC AND EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICIES. THE STUDY OF THE ROLE OF STATE MANAGEMENT OF THE INNOVATIVE COMPONENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY DEVELOPMENT IN THE ARTICLE IS CARRIED OUT IN THE FOLLOWING LOGICAL SEQUENCE: AT THE FIRST STAGE, THE INITIAL DATA ARRAY WAS FORMED, WHICH WAS CHECKED FOR MULTICOLLINEARITY (PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT) AND NORMALITY OF DISTRIBUTION (GRAPHIC QUANTILE METHOD OF COMPARING TWO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS) USING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TOOLS AT THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES; AT THE FOURTH STAGE, A QUANTILE REGRESSION OLS MODEL WAS BUILT, WHICH ALLOWS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE STUDIED FACTORS. METHODS OF BIBLIOMETRIC AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, CORRELATIONAL AND QUANTILE METHODS BECAME THE METHODOLOGICAL TOOLS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH, THE YEARS FROM 2000 TO 2020 WERE CHOSEN AS THE RESEARCH PERIOD. UKRAINE AND THE EU COUNTRIES (27) WERE CHOSEN AS THE OBJECT OF THE STUDY, BECAUSE THEY ALLOW US TO COMPARE THE LEVEL OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF COUNTRIES AND THEIR POSITIONS IN THE WORLD RANKING OF THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND FOUND THAT FOR UKRAINE, THE DIFFUSION OF GREEN INNOVATIONS LEADS TO A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY BY 0.7%, WHILE FOR THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION - BY AN AVERAGE OF 3%. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SHOWS THAT THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT IN INCREASING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IS PROVIDED BY THE GROWTH OF GREEN INNOVATIONS AND THE ACTIVATION OF THE GREEN INVESTMENT MARKET. INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TO THE LEVEL OF REFERENCE COUNTRIES WILL ALLOW TO INCREASE THE DIVERGENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY SUB -INDEX FOR UKRAINE BY 16.1% FOR THE RULE OF LAW, 18.9% FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO OPENLY IMPLEMENT POLICIES AND REGULATORY MEASURES, AND 10.7% FOR CORRUPTION CONTROL. THE RESULTS OF THE CONDUCTED RESEARCH MAY BE USEFUL FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY.
376	IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF DETERMINING CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FOUNDATIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF USING VARIOUS CRIMINAL POLICY MANAGEMENT TOOLS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE POLICY'S EFFECTIVENESS AND STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS STUDY IS THE DESCRIPTION OF ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF THE CONTENT OF CRIMINAL POLICY AND THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENT IN RUSSIA AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE COUNTRY'S HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DETERMINE THE PLACE OF CRIMINAL POLICY IN THE SYSTEM OF STATE AND INTERNATIONAL POLICIES. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE THEORETICAL MATERIAL FROM A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS (P.V. ZHESTEROV, A.P. KUZNETSOV, E.V. KUNTS, R.A. ROMASHOV, V.P. SALNIKOV, AND OTHERS). THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY WERE ALSO USED. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY IS DIALECTIC, COMPARATIVE LEGAL AND FORMAL LEGAL METHODS. IN PARTICULAR, THE USE OF THE DIALECTICAL METHOD CONTRIBUTED TO THE STUDY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION IN THE FIELD OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE CRIMINAL POLICY OF RUSSIA, THE PRE-REVOLUTIONARY, SOVIET, AND MODERN PERIODS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE USE OF COMPARATIVE LEGAL AND FORMAL LEGAL METHODS HELPED TO IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO THE CONDUCT OF CRIMINAL POLICY IN THE COUNTRIES PARTICIPATING IN THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE PROSPECTS FOR USING VARIOUS CRIMINAL POLICY MEASURES TO DEVELOP THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF RUSSIA. AS A RESULT, THE AUTHORS CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIAN POLICY AT ALL STAGES OF ITS FORMATION WAS BASED ON THE DELIMITATION AND ISOLATION OF GOVERNMENT BODIES AND OFFICIALS FROM SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND ITS INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVES IN PARTICULAR. IN THE POLITICAL PRACTICE OF RUSSIA, THE PEOPLE AT ALL HISTORICAL STAGES WERE NOT SUBJECTS OF POLITICAL POWER BUT, RATHER, OBJECTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHOSE VITAL ACTIVITY WAS ALWAYS DETERMINED BY A "HIGHER WILL". UNCONSCIOUS RESISTANCE TO THIS WILL IN A NUMBER OF CASES RESULTED IN "BLIND AND MERCILESS RUSSIAN RIOTS", REPRESENTING THE SO-CALLED "CONFLICTS OF HOPELESSNESS", INHERENTLY DOOMED AND DESTRUCTIVE IN ESSENCE. A FEATURE OF THE CRIMINAL POLICY OF THE STATE, AS APPLIED TO MODERN RUSSIA, IS ITS "FOCUS" ON THE PERSONALITY OF THE HEAD OF STATE-THE PRESIDENT, WHO OWNS BOTH THE PREROGATIVES IN THE FIELD OF LEGISLATIVE, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND PERSONNEL SUPPORT OF ANTI-CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND THE "FINAL WORD" IN THE FIELD OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AND JUSTICE. IN RELATION TO CRIMINAL POLICY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, RUSSIA ACTS AS ONE OF THE MEMBER STATES, WHICH IN THE FORMAL SENSE DOES NOT DIFFER FROM OTHER UN MEMBER STATES, BUT IN REALITY CLAIMS TO HAVE THE SAME CENTRAL PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS THAT THE USSR HAD BEFORE.
377	AS WE ENTER THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IT IS APPROPRIATE TO QUESTION WHETHER SOCIAL CONTROL THROUGH THE LEGAL ORDER AND INSTITUTIONALIZED POLICING IS EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE. AS NATIONAL SOCIETIES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL AND TO PROTECT AGAINST A WIDER RANGE OF CONTINGENCIES, ARISING FROM A MORE COMPLEX DIVISION OF LABOUR, FROM CHANGING SOCIAL STANDARDS LEADING TO HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF HEALTH AND WELFARE, AND FROM NEW CONTINGENCIES SUCH AS THE THREATS OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION OR THE NEED TO REGULATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, SO THEY HAVE PRODUCED MORE AND MORE ELABORATE LAWS. WHAT CARL SCHMITT CALLED 'MOTORIZED LEGISLATION 'HAS BECOME A REALITY. IT THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE THE SHEER VOLUME OF LAWS, THEIR COMPLEXITY AND INTERCONNECTION, AND THEIR CONSTANTLY CHANGING NATURE MAKE THE APPLICATION OF RULES UNCERTAIN AND KNOWLEDGE OF THEM, EVEN BY SPECIALIST LAWYERS, DOUBTFUL. LAWS AND SUBSIDIARY REGULATIONS COVER KILOMETRES OF SHELF SPACE, AND THE OPERATION OF LAW BECOMES EVER COSTLIER-SO MUCH SO THAT MAJOR COMPANIES ARE WRITING ARBITRATION CLAUSES INTO THEIR CONTRACTS. AT THE SAME TIME MOST WESTERN, SOCIETIES HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE HETEROGENEOUS, IN MAJOR CITIES DIVERSE ETHNIC AND LIFESTYLE GROUPS LEAD SEPARATE LIVES. RULES FOR ONE GROUP ABOUT ACCEPTABLE CONDUCT WILL SELDOM ENTIRELY AGREE WITH ANOTHER'S-BORN AGAIN CHRISTIANS AND GAYS ARE UNLIKELY TO AGREE, FOR EXAMPLE OUTSIDE OF A THIN CORE OF PUBLIC MORALITY-ALMOST EVERYONE WILL AGREE THAT MURDER, THEFT AND FRAUD ARE CRIMES-GROUPS WOULD BE BETTER OFFSETTING AND POLICING THEIR OWN STANDARDS. CITIZENS WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT DIFFERENT RULES APPLIED TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WITH INFORMAL SELF-REGULATION AND ARBITRATION. BASING MODERN SOCIETIES ON COMMUNITIES OF CHOICE, DEMOCRATICALLY SELF-GOVERNING, WOULD REDUCE THE LOAD OF CENTRAL INSPECTION AND RULE MAKING. THIS WOULD BOTH CHECK RULE PROLIFERATION. AND ALLOW DIFFERENT GROUPS TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN. AFFAIRS. LAWS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED AND, APPLIED TO A THINNER CORE OF COMMON SOCIAL LIFE COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE. FAR FROM UNDERMINING FORMAL LAW, COMMUNITY SELF-REGULATION COULD RESTORE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN IT AND BY REDUCING THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF COMMON RULE-MAKING AND POLICING, MAKE BOTH MORE EFFECTIVE. BASING SOCIETIES AROUND PLURAL SELF-GOVERNING COMMUNITIES OF CHOICE WOULD ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION OF DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY, BUT ALSO OFFER THE CONSTRAINT OF EXIT OVER EXCESSIVE COMMUNITY REGULATION, SINCE SUCH OBLIGATIONS WOULD BE VOLUNTARY. GREATER COMMUNITY SELF-CONTROL WOULD TEND TO REDUCE INTER-COMMUNITY FRICTION, BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NOT FEEL THREATENED THAT THEY WOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION IN MATTERS OF MORALS AND LIFESTYLES BY ARTIFICIAL POLITICAL MAJORITIES. THE POLITICAL DOCTRINE FOR SUCH A: SYSTEM OF GROUPS OL COMMUNITY SELF-GOVERNANCE IS CALLED ASSOCIATIONALISM OR ASSOCIATIVE DEMOCRACY. ALLIED WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND WELFARE ON AN ASSOCIATIONALIST MODEL, COMMUNITY SELF-GOVERNANCE WOULD STRENGTHEN THE ROOTS OF MODERN SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND MAKE A VIRTUE OF INCREASING MORAL AND VALUE PLURALISM.
378	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE EVOLUTION OF THE WESTERN MODEL OF SETTLING THE AFGHAN CONFLICT IN THE PERIOD FROM 2001 TO 2014. ON THE BASIS OF THE CASE-STUDY METHOD, THE AUTHORS ANALYSE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S MAIN GOALS AND OBJECTIVES IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE AFGHAN CONFLICT. THROUGH THE LENS OF DOCUMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES ON AFGHANISTAN, THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES, PARTICIPANTS' MOTIVES, CONTRADICTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AFGHAN DIPLOMATIC PROCESS ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE PATH FROM THE ROMANTIC-IDEALISTIC TO THE PRAGMATIC-REALISTIC APPROACH IN RESOLVING THE AFGHAN CONFLICT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION IS TRACED. THE AUTHORS COME TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS DURING THE STUDY. FIRST, THERE WAS AN APPLICATION OF THE "WESTERN MODEL" OF STATE BUILDING IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE FIRST "ROMANTIC" STAGE FROM 2001 TO 2006. HOWEVER, IGNORING THE SPECIFICS OF THE COUNTRY OF AFGHANISTAN HELPED CREATE ONLY A VISIBILITY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE EMPHASIS ON FORCEFUL METHODS OF RESOLVING THE AFGHAN CONFLICT EXCLUDED INFLUENTIAL SOCIAL ACTORS FROM THE POLITICAL PROCESS. AT THE SAME TIME, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO CREATE A COMBAT-READY NATIONAL ARMY OF AFGHANISTAN, AND MAINTAINING SECURITY IN THE COUNTRY BECAME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL MILITARY. THIS SITUATION DISCREDITED THE NEW AUTHORITIES OF AFGHANISTAN. SECOND, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS THE BASIS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF AFGHANISTAN AT THE SECOND "TRANSITIONAL" STAGE FROM 2006 TO 2009. HOWEVER, THE ASYMMETRY IN FAVOR OF MILITARY SPENDING, THE BUREAUCRATIC NATURE OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE MECHANISMS, AND THE CONNIVING ATTITUDE TO FINANCIAL CONTROL MECHANISMS FAILED TO REVERSE THE NEGATIVE TRENDS IN THE COUNTRY'S SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE HIGH INTENSITY OF CLASHES NULLIFIED THE MINIMUM ACHIEVEMENTS OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. MOREOVER, THE INCREASE IN LOSSES AMONG INTERNATIONAL MILITARY CONTINGENTS, THE REPUTATION LOSSES OF THE NEWLY CREATED DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS FORCED THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO QUALITATIVELY REVIEW APPROACHES TO THE AFGHAN DIPLOMATIC PROCESS. THIRD, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EMBARKED ON AN HONORARY EXIT FROM AFGHANISTAN AT THE THIRD "PRAGMATIC" STAGE FROM 2009 TO 2014. THE STAKE WAS MADE ON A GRADUAL TRANSIT OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO THE LEADERSHIP OF AFGHANISTAN WHILE KEEPING THE IMAGE OF INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURES. THE SELF-RELIANCE OF AFGHANISTAN WAS BECOMING THE MAIN IDEOLOGICAL PATTERN OF THIS STAGE. PLANNING HORIZONS OF THE AFGHAN CONFLICT WERE SHIFTED FOR AN INDEFINITE 2024. THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS BECAME A KIND OF PAY FOR DISTANCING AFGHAN PEACEBUILDING. HOWEVER, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT WAY OF FINANCIAL FLOW INTO THE COUNTRY AND IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN MAINTAINING POWER IN KABUL. THE AFGHAN PEACE PROCESS, AS A COLLECTIVE SECURITY PROJECT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, BEGAN TO BREAK UP INTO INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL INITIATIVES BY GLOBAL ACTORS.
379	TERRORISM IS A SOCIAL DISEASE BOTH OF INDIVIDUAL SOCIETIES AND HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND, AS ANY ILLNESS, IS THE RESULT OF DEVIATIONS FROM THE NATURAL COURSE OF THEIR LIFE. IF CONTAMINATION OF HUMAN HABITATION GIVES RISE TO PHYSICAL ILLNESSES, AND EPIDEMICS, "FILTH" OF SOCIAL HABITATION, I.E. SOCIAL INJUSTICE, ANARCHY AND VIOLENCE OF CERTAIN GROUPS OVER OTHERS GIVES RISE TO DANGEROUS SOCIAL DISEASES, ONE OF WHICH TERRORISM IS. TO PREVENT THE DISEASE AND TREAT THEM EFFECTIVELY AFTER THEIR APPEARANCE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEFINE THE CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AND TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE. BUT SO FAR, THE ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE TOWARDS TERRORISM COMES DOWN TO FIGHT ONLY ITS EXTERNAL MANIFESTATIONS WITHOUT GIVING PROPER ATTENTION TO THEIR CAUSES. IN THE ARTICLE THE PROBLEM OF TERRORISM IS CONSIDERED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ITS MAIN CAUSES. ACTUALITY OF THE STUDIED PROBLEM IS THAT TERRORISM AS A SOCIAL DISEASE ACCEPTS IN CONTEMPORANEOUS WORLD THE PANDEMIC CHARACTER AND THE REASONS FOR THIS MUST BE FOUND. THE ARTICLE PURPORTS TO ESTABLISH THE DIAGNOSIS OF THIS DISEASE TO FACILITATE HER TREATMENT. ATTENTIVE AND IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF THE TERRORIST ACTS OF THE PAST DECADES BY SCHOLARS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES GIVES THE RIGHT TO SUGGEST THAT MANY OF THESE ACTS WERE SOME KIND OF SPONTANEOUS RESPONSES TO ILLEGITIMATE ACTS OF THE STATES. INJUSTICES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, INCAPABILITY OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER TO EFFECTIVELY CARRY OUT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTIES (PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ENSURE THEIR SECURITY) PROVOKE SOME INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS OF PEOPLE TO NO LESS UNLAWFUL AND CRUEL ACTS. TERRORIST MOVEMENTS ARE OFTEN THE CREATIONS OF THE COMPETING IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE WORLD STATES SEEKING "PULL THE CHESTNUTS OUT OF THE FIRE BY SOMEBODY'S ELLS HANDS." THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW SOME OF THE GREATER POWERS OF THE WORLD, SHORTSIGHTEDLY TREATING TERRORISTS AS ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST RIVAL AND PROVIDING THEM WITH MATERIAL RESOURCES, GENERATE THEIR OWN ENEMIES. THIS FINDING WAS CONFIRMED IN ALL STUDIES ON THIS ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IN STUDIES OF THE ENGLISH SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. BUT SO FAR, MORE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO SHOW THE ACTIVITIES OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, ITS EFFECTS AND TO JUSTIFICATION OF THE NEED TO COMBAT THEM. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES TERRORISM AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON WITH AN AIM TO ESTABLISH ITS NATURE AND CAUSES, AS WELL AS EFFECTIVE MEANS OF ITS PREVENTION. MATERIALS AND THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY MAY BE USEFUL TO THE STATE INSTITUTIONS IN DEFINING THEIR STRATEGY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE CAUSES AND WAYS OF PREVENTING NEGATIVE PHENOMENA IN THE LIFE OF SOCIETIES AND IN RELATIONS BETWEEN THEM.
380	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE EFFECT OF SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE RATE OF CREATION OF NEW COMPANIES BETWEEN COUNTRIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT. H1 STATES THAT THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE HELP TO EXPLAIN THE IMMEDIATE CREATION OF NEW BUSINESSES IN EUROPEAN AND NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. H2 STATES THAT THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF GOVERNANCE HELP TO EXPLAIN THE DEFERRED CREATION OF NEW BUSINESSES IN EUROPEAN AND NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE PAPER USES TWO TYPES OF ANALYSES: FIRSTLY, UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS, WHICH IS A DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS OF THE DEPENDENT, INDEPENDENT AND CONTROL VARIABLES, AND THE RESULTS OF A T-TEST; AND SECONDLY, MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, WHICH ESTIMATES USING THE FIXED-EFFECTS ESTIMATOR UNDER THE SPECIFICATIONS PREVIOUSLY RAISED FOR THE SUBSAMPLE OF 28 EU COUNTRIES AND FOR THE SUBSAMPLE OF 103 NON-EU COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 2004-2014. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE VARIABLES OF GOVERNANCE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE EU, ALTHOUGH THE DENSITY OF THE ENTERPRISES IS. WITHIN THE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE EU. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FOR THE EU CONFIRMED H1 AND H2, WITH A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WHILE THE OTHER GOVERNANCE VARIABLES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE EU SUBSAMPLE. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FOR NON-EU COUNTRIES SUGGEST NO SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (H1) AND A SLIGHTLY SIGNIFICANT DELAYED EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW ON THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP (H2) CONCERNED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA COULD CONSIDER INTRODUCING ANOTHER REGIONAL DIVISION OR OTHER TYPES OF METHODOLOGY AS VARIABLES AFFECT MODELS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - GOVERNANCE CAN BE DEFINED AS THE ABILITY OF A GOVERNMENT AND ITS PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENT RULES, WHICH IS A FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE CREATION OF NEW COMPANIES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY AND ITS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE EFFECT OF SIX GOVERNANCE INDICATORS ON THE RATE OF CREATION OF NEW COMPANIES CONSIDERING TWO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AS COUNTRIES ARE PRESUMABLY HETEROGENEOUS. THEREFORE, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE VARIABLES ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP DIFFERS ACCORDING TO THE REGION. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE VARIABLES ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACCORDING TO THE REGION IS ALSO KNOWN. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS STUDY APPLIED PANEL DATA ANALYSIS TO TWO SAMPLES OF COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD 2004-2014, ONE FORMED BY 28 COUNTRIES OF THE EU AND THE OTHER BY 103 NON-EU COUNTRIES. NO OTHER PAPER CONSIDERS THIS NUMBER OF COUNTRIES FOR THIS PERIOD. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE ON THE CREATION OF NEW COMPANIES, THIS PAPER CONSIDERED THE EXISTENCE OF IMMEDIATE AND DEFERRED EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP.
381	TOPICALITY. UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF UKRAINE'S INTEGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO RESTRUCTURE ALL SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, FREEING THEM FROM ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION, INCLUDING ON THE BASIS OF GENDER. MODERN PROBLEMS OF THE STATE'S SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REQUIRE A NEW LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF MEN AND WOMEN, AS WELL AS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL FUTURE OF SOCIETY DEPENDS ON OVERCOMING GENDER STEREOTYPES THAT ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND INHIBIT SOCIAL PROGRESS, AND ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRACY. THAT IS WHY, TODAY, IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE AND THE ROLE OF WOMEN AND DETERMINE THEIR SOCIAL STATUS AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STATE. PURPOSE. THE ARTICLE STUDIES THE EMERGENCE AND ADOPTION OF THE PHENOMENON OF GENDER AS A FACTOR OF THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE UKRAINIAN WOMAN IN THE HISTORICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL REALM. METHODOLOGY. IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS THE AUTHORS USED THE METHODS OF ANALYZING AND SYNTHESIZING HISTORICAL SOURCES TO STUDY THE CONTENT AND MAIN PROVISIONS OF PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS AND LEGAL NORMS THAT FORMED THE SOCIAL STATUS OF A UKRAINIAN WOMAN AT DIFFERENT HISTORICAL PERIODS OF SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT, WITH THEIR SUBSEQUENT COMPARISON AND GENERALIZATION. ORIGINALITY. THE WORK FURTHER DEVELOPS THE THEORY OF GENDER PROCESSES WITH THE USE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENON OF GENDER IN THE HISTORICAL, PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL FIELD AS A FACTOR OF THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE UKRAINIAN WOMAN, TO CRITICALLY RE-EVALUATE THE VALUE GUIDELINES ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF MODERN SOCIETY AND THE FORMATION OF NEW IDEAS ABOUT THE ROLE AND MODEL OF BEHAVIOR OF MEN AND WOMEN AND THEIR INTERACTION IN SOCIETY. CONCLUSIONS. FOR A LONG TIME, THE SOCIAL STATUS OF WOMEN WAS FORMED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS AND CONCEPTS, SLOWLY TURNED INTO THE MORAL TRADITIONS OF PEOPLES AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE HIGH STATUS OF A WOMAN, AS A FULL-FLEDGED MEMBER OF SOCIETY, FORMED IN THE EARLY STATE STAGES, LOST ITS RELEVANCE ALREADY IN THE DAYS OF ANTIQUITY. THE WOMAN BECAME A SYMBOL OF EXCLUSIVELY DOMESTIC, FAMILY RELATIONS AND PLAYED THE ROLE OF GUARDIAN OF THE PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SOCIAL BEING OF MEN. THIS TREND FOUND ITS CONTINUATION IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE MIDDLE AGES AND LEFT AN IMPRINT IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MODERN TIMES AND GERMAN CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY. IN THE PERIOD FROM KIEVAN RUS TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, THE UKRAINIAN WOMAN REMAINED A VICTIM OF STEREOTYPED THINKING. DESPITE THE NORMATIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE EQUALITY OF MEN AND WOMEN IN MODERN CONDITIONS, THIS EQUALITY HAS A PURELY DECLARATIVE NATURE.
382	SINCE THE 1980S, REFORMS HAVE DOMINATED GOVERNMENT AGENDAS AROUND THE WORLD; GOVERNMENTS EMBARKED ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF INNOVATION. THE PACE OF REFORM IS NOT LIKELY TO ABATE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES CALL FOR THE ACTIVE CONTRIBUTION OF MANY ACTORS ACROSS AND BEYOND GOVERNMENT AND REQUIRE GOVERNMENT TO WORK OUTSIDE OF CONVENTIONAL BOUNDARIES. THEY COMPEL GOVERNMENT TO USE ITS AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES TO ENABLE AND EMPOWER OTHERS. INCREASED COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY WITHIN POLICY ISSUES AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXTS ARE PROMPTING GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE, INTERVENE, INNOVATE, LEARN, AND ADAPT. FUTURE REFORMS WILL NECESSITATE AN EXPANDED VIEW OF THE ROLES OF GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS. WHILE GOVERNMENT REMAINS THE STEWARD OF COLLECTIVE INTEREST WITH THE POWER TO INTERVENE, GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EXPLORE HOW IT CAN WORK WITH CITIZENS AND OTHER ACTORS TO PRODUCE RESULTS OF HIGH PUBLIC VALUE. AS GOVERNMENTS MOVE TOWARDS PRODUCING RESULTS WITH CITIZENS, THEY STRIKE A MORE COMPLETE SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPAND THE REPERTOIRE OF ROLES EACH CAN PLAY TO ACHIEVE RESULTS. THESE REFORMS WILL ALLOW A BROADER DEFINITION OF PUBLIC RESULTS THAT EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH PUBLIC POLICY AND CIVIC RESULTS. THE LATTER BUILD CREDIBILITY, WHILE THE FORMER INCREASE LEGITIMACY. BOTH ENHANCE CITIZENS' TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS HAVE THUS FAR BEEN WORKING FROM AN INCOMPLETE DEFINITION OF RESULTS THAT DOES NOT GIVE SUFFICIENT WEIGHT TO CIVIC RESULTS. FINALLY, FUTURE REFORMS WILL ALSO REQUIRE A MORE DYNAMIC UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THAT SUPPORTS THE BUILDING OF CAPACITY. CAPACITY BUILDING IN NEW AREAS IS REQUIRED TO PURSUE THE PUBLIC GOOD IN AN INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, BUT THIS WORK MUST BEGIN BY VALUING AND PRESERVING EXISTING CAPACITIES. CENTRAL AMONG THESE IS THE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE, THE HALLMARK OF GOOD GOVERNMENT. IT INCLUDES: A RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS; DUE PROCESS; ACCOUNTABILITY; AND PUBLIC SECTOR VALUES. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO PROVIDING A SOLID INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION FOR PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD ALSO PRESERVE THEIR FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE. THIS INCLUDES: MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT; IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL SILOS; BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF CITIZENS; IMPROVING GOVERNANCE PROCESSES; AND HARNESSING THE POWER OF MODERN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. NOTWITHSTANDING CONCERTED EFFORTS TO BUILD GOVERNMENT CAPACITY TO ANTICIPATE, DETECT AND INTERVENE, UNPREDICTABLE EVENTS AND SHOCKS WILL OCCUR. GIVEN THIS, GOVERNMENT MUST ALSO FOCUS ON RESILIENCE BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY TO INNOVATE, LEARN AND ADAPT, AND BY ENSURING A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RISKS. IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO IMPROVE ANTICIPATIVE, INNOVATIVE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITIES WILL REQUIRE TARGETED INVESTMENTS FOR THE LONG TERM AND TOLERANCE OF SOME "EXCESS" CAPACITY. ULTIMATELY, THIS WILL REQUIRE RECOGNITION THAT LESS GOVERNMENT, AND MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT NECESSARILY AMOUNT TO BETTER GOVERNMENT.
383	BACKGROUND: THE PROPER RESOLUTION OF APPLICATIONS FOR CHALLENGE (SELF-CHALLENGE) OF A JUDGE (INVESTIGATIVE JUDGE, COURT) IS IMPORTANT FOR FURTHER CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, AS A JUDICIAL ERROR IN THIS MATTER MAY RESULT IN THE VIOLATION OF A PERSON'S RIGHT TO 'LAWFUL COMPOSITION OF THE COURT' OR THE RIGHT TO DEFENCE, WHICH IS GROUNDS FOR THE CANCELLATION OF THE COURT DECISION IN THE CASE AND ITS REFERRAL TO A NEW TRIAL (ART. 412 OF THE CRPC), THE VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF REASONABLE TIME TERMS, AND THE LEGAL CERTAINTY (FINALITY) OF COURT DECISIONS AS PART OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE, PROCEEDINGS ON CHALLENGES BELONG TO SEPARATE COMMON PROCEEDINGS, WHICH USUALLY END WITH A REFUSAL TO SATISFY THE CHALLENGE. LAWYERS ASSESS THE INSTITUTE OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS OF UKRAINE AS INEFFECTIVE. METHODS: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE USING THE COMPARATIVE METHOD, SO THAT VIEWS ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING ARE CONSISTENT IN THE PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE. THE ARTICLE OUTLINES THE LIST OF GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE OF A JUDGE (INVESTIGATIVE JUDGE, COURT) UNDER THE CRPC OF UKRAINE AND PRESENTS THEIR CLASSIFICATION AS UNCONDITIONAL AND EVALUATIVE, WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR THE SELECTION OF METHODS OF PROOF. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE AND THE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING THE IMPARTIALITY OF THE COURT IN THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) IS SHOWN. THE MAIN FOCUS IS ON THE ANALYSIS OF UNCONDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL CLASSIFICATION, AND THEIR CONTENT IS REVEALED IN RELATION TO THE POSITIONS OF THE ECTHR. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE GROUNDS FOR CHALLENGE ARE NOT ONLY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAST DOUBT ON THE IMPARTIALITY OF A JUDGE (INVESTIGATING JUDGE, COURT) FOUND IN PARA. 6 OF CHAPTER 3 OF THE CRPC OF UKRAINE 'CHALLENGE', BUT ALSO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE THAT THE JUDGE DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF 'LEGAL COMPOSITION OF THE COURT' (PART 2 OF ART. 412 OF THE CRPC) OR 'COURT ESTABLISHED BY LAW' (IN THE WORDING OF PART 1 OF ART. 6 OF THE ECHR) FOUND IN VARIOUS STRUCTURAL PARTS OF THE CRPC AND IN THE LAW 'ON THE JUDICIARY AND THE STATUS OF JUDGES'. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE WORDING OF PART 1 OF ART. 76 OF THE CRPC OF 14 JANUARY 2021 IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY AN IMPARTIAL COURT (ART. 21 OF THE CRPC) SINCE THE RIGHT TO AN IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL (PART 1 OF ART. 6 OF THE ECHR) CREATES A CONFLICT WITH CHAPTER 18 OF THE CRPC ON THE PROCEDURE FOR ELECTION, CHANGE OF PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES, DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, AND MAY BE GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINTS TO THE ECTHR.
384	THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS HOMO DIGNUS AS A THEORETICAL, CONSTITUTIONAL, AND LEGAL CONCEPT; SECULAR AND THEOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DIGNITY, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ROMAN CONCEPT OF DIGNITAS AND THE THEOLOGICAL CONCEPT "IMAGE OF GOD" ("IMAGO DEI"). THE PROBLEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL AND WIDER LEGAL REGULATION OF HUMAN DIGNITY IN THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT IS INVESTIGATED. THE MANY FACES OF THE TERM "DIGNITY" IN MODERN SCIENTIFIC JURISPRUDENCE AND APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD IN CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE IN A COMPARATIVE ASPECT ARE REVEALED. THE ARTICLE USES METHODS OF DISCURSIVE AND COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS, THE METHOD OF CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, SPECIFIC HISTORICAL AND FORMAL LEGAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. THE AUTHOR NOTES THE EXISTENCE OF FIVE AREAS THAT AFFECT THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF MAN AND LEGAL FORMS OF CONSOLIDATION OF HUMAN DIGNITY: (1) A PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL APPROACH THAT COMBINES ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY WITH ANALYTICAL JURISPRUDENCE; (2) A PHILOSOPHICAL AND ETHICAL APPROACH THAT UPHOLDS THE MORAL AND HUMANISTIC VALUE OF HUMAN DIGNITY; (3) AN EXISTENTIAL APPROACH ENCOMPASSING PHILOSOPHICAL AND LEGAL EXISTENCE; (4) A THEOLOGICAL APPROACH BASED ON CHRISTIAN ETHICS; (5) THE APPROACH OF LEGAL POLYMORPHISM. THIS ARTICLE SUBSTANTIATES THE CONCEPT "CONSTITUTIONALISM OF HUMAN DIGNITY" FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE RUSSIAN, COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM OF HUMAN DIGNITY IS BEING FORMED IN RUSSIA. THE DOCTRINE SEEKS TO COVER VARIOUS LEGAL ASPECTS OF USING THE CONCEPT "DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD", AS ENSHRINED IN THE PROVISIONS OF PART 1 OF ARTICLE 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE ELEMENTS OF THIS DOCTRINE ARE: (1) THE PRINCIPLE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY, (2) THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARD OF THE DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD, (3) THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURAL AND RUSSIAN SECTORAL (PROCEDURAL) PROTECTION OF THE DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD, (4) THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL DIGNITY AS A CONSTITUTIONALIZED PRINCIPLE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF A PERSON, (5) THE SUBJECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DIGNITY THE ARTICLE CONTAINS REFLECTIONS ON THE UNIVERSALITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL AND SEMANTIC FIELD OF THE CONCEPT "DIGNITY", ON THE HEURISTIC VALUE OF HUMAN DIGNITY FOR MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW; ABOUT THE PLACE OF DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF MAN AND CITIZEN, GENERAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF IDENTIFYING THE INSTITUTION OF DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD; THE PROBLEM OF THE RATIO OF EQUAL DIGNITY AND CITIZENSHIP. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, AFTER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (1993), A COMPLEX CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL INSTITUTION OF THE DIGNITY OF PERSONHOOD IS BEING GRADUALLY FORMED. THIS INSTITUTION IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL INNOVATION IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE LEGAL STATUS OF MAN AND CITIZEN.
385	THE CIVILIZATION APPROACH, WHICH ASSERTS THE PRIMACY OF THE SPIRITUAL SPHERE OF MAN (RELIGION, CULTURE, MORALITY, SCIENCE, LAW, EDUCATION) IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF THE PYRAMID OF CIVILIZATIONS, EXPLAINS THE DEEP PROPERTIES OF THE MOTIVATION OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIO-POLITICAL SPHERE OF LIFE, WHICH INCLUDES LEGAL RELATIONS RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. IN ARTICLE 1 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON JUSTICE AS A PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW, THE LEGISLATOR HAS REMAINED SILENT. IT IS MENTIONED IN PART 2 OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH SETS OUT THE PROVISIONS OF THE APPLICATION OF CIVIL LEGISLATION BY ANALOGUEY. FOR COMPARISON, THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE CRIMINAL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) (AS AMENDED ON AUGUST 13, 2019) EXPLICITLY ESTABLISHES THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE IN ARTICLE 6 AND AS A CATEGORY OF ETHICAL, MORAL AND SOCIO-LEGAL NATURE IS ADDRESSED EQUALLY TO THE LEGISLATOR, AND TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND AS THE HIGHEST IDEA, THE BEGINNING IS CHARACTERIZED BY UNIVERSALITY, IMPORTANCE AND SUPREME IMPERATIVE. IF WE CONSIDER THE CATEGORIES OF "JUSTICE", "GOOD FAITH", AND "REASONABLENESS" AS IDEAS COMING TO US FROM NATURAL LAW, THEN THEY SHOULD BE INTERPRETED IN AN ABSTRACT WAY AS FORMAL PRINCIPLES-PRESUMPTIONS - THIS SHOULD NOT BE OTHERWISE (PART 5 OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION). THE PRINCIPLES OF PRESUMPTION, WHICH ARE LAID DOWN IN THE BASIS OF CIVIL LAW AS A STARTING POINT, FOR THE GENERAL REGULATION OF ABSOLUTE RELATIONS, IN RELATIVE RELATIONS INVOLVING SPECIFIC LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN SPECIFIC SUBJECTS, ARE ALREADY REALIZED THROUGH REGULATORY AND PROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS AS LEGAL PRINCIPLES. THUS, IN THE PROCESS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE PRINCIPLES OF PRESUMPTION ARE TRANSFORMED INTO LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REBUTTAL OR DOUBT AS PRESUMPTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE ISSUES, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE BEGINNING OF CIVIL LAW - JUSTICE, INTEGRITY AND REASONABLENESS - IS THE VALUES OF NATURAL LAW THAT OBJECTIVELY EXIST, DO NOT DEPEND ON THE WILL OF MAN, TIME AND SPACE BOUNDARIES, WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF INFLUENCING ALL SPHERES OF HUMAN LIFE, SOCIETY, POSITIVE LEGISLATION OF INDIVIDUAL STATES, AND SOMETIMES TO BREAK THE POSITIVE BIAS. THUS, THE LAW IS NOT LIMITED ONLY TO THE LAW AS ONE OF ITS FORMS, BUT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER SOCIAL REGULATORS, IN PARTICULAR THE NORMS OF MORALITY, TRADITION, CUSTOMS AND THE LIKE, SOCIETY AND ARE CONDITIONED BY THE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED CULTURAL LEVEL OF SOCIETY. THAT IS WHY, IN EACH CASE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIND A PERMANENT BALANCE BETWEEN STRICT UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE, REASONABLENESS AND GOOD FAITH, BOTH BY THE COURT AND BY OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCEEDINGS.
386	THE ARTICLE "CRIMINAL POLICY: DEFINITION AND PURPOSE" IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF DOCTRINAL APPROACHES OF SUCH LEADING MODERN SCIENTISTS TO THE DEFINITION OF THE CATEGORY OF "CRIMINAL POLICY" AS A.I. ALEKSANDROV, M.M. BABAEV, A.I. BOYKO, S.S. BOSHOLOV, G.Y. LESNIKOV, N.A. LOPASHENKO, A.V. NAUMOV, E.F. POBEGAILO, Y.E. PUDOVOCHKIN, A.I. RAROG AND OTHERS. STATING THE FACT OF PLURALISM OF OPINIONS REGARDING THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE TERM "CRIMINAL POLICY", INCLUDING THE PURPOSE OF CRIMINAL POLICY AS A KEY COMPONENT, THE ISSUES OF "VOLUME" OF CRIMINAL POLICY, ITS SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS OF INFLUENCE ARE INVESTIGATED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS ARGUED THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO LIMIT CRIMINAL POLICY TO "STRATEGY" AND TO REFUSE SUCH A COMPONENT, OFTEN REFERRED TO BY AUTHORS AS "TACTICS". SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE ISSUE OF THE PURPOSE OF CRIMINAL POLICY, FOR THIS PURPOSE WE REFER TO VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AND PUT FORWARD THE THESIS ON THE RELATIVE NECESSITY OF SHIFTING THE EMPHASIS IN DETERMINING THE PURPOSE OF CRIMINAL POLICY DUE TO THE INADMISSIBILITY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT "NARROWING". IN PARTICULAR, IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE GOAL IS STILL THE FINAL RESULT, WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THE RULE OF LAW - THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE FULLY PROTECTED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE EMPHASIS SHOULD BE SHIFTED FROM SUCH VARIANTS OF THE GOAL AS REDUCTION, MINIMISATION, ELIMINATION OF CRIME (AS WELL AS CRIME CONTROL), SINCE THESE GOALS SHOULD BE RECOGNISED AS INTERMEDIATE RESULTS, AND, IN ADDITION, THIS APPROACH IS LIKELY TO CREATE A RISK OF "ABUSE" ON THE PART OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF ARTIFICIAL "EXTERNAL" REDUCTION OF CRIME RATES. IT IS ARGUED THAT IT IS INCORRECT TO SPECIFY AS A GOAL THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, SINCE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CRIMINAL LAW HAS A MORE PUNITIVE POTENTIAL THAN A RESTORATIVE ONE, AND A NUMBER OF CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OFFENCES CANNOT BE COMPENSATED TO THE NECESSARY EXTENT. ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE STUDY, WE FOCUS ON THE KEY ASPECTS, THE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH, WHEN FORMING THE DEFINITION OF "CRIMINAL POLICY", IS RECOGNISED AS APPROPRIATE. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS POINTED OUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO REFUSE LACONIC DEFINITIONS, AS WELL AS THE USE OF THE WORDS "POLICY" AND "TACTICS"; IT IS RECOMMENDED TO LIMIT THE "OBJECT" OF CRIMINAL POLICY TO CRIME (EXCLUDING "OTHER OFFENCES"), THE SUBJECT OF CRIMINAL POLICY IS PROPOSED TO BE RECOGNISED ONLY BY THE STATE. AS A FINAL CONCLUSION, THE AUTHOR'S DEFINITION OF CRIMINAL POLICY IS PROPOSED, UNDER WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO UNDERSTAND "STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE TO COUNTER CRIME IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL".
387	IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL RISK EARLY WARNING (EW) MODEL IS OPTIMIZED. THE FINANCIAL PREVENTION AND CONTROL MEASURES WITH LEGAL PROTECTION ARE IMPLEMENTED TO WARN THE FINANCIAL RISKS, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET (FM) AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FINANCIAL RISK PREVENTION AND CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THIS PAPER COMBINES THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL AND THE MARKOV REGIME SWITCHING VECTOR AUTO REGRESSION (MS-VAR) MODEL AND CONSTRUCTS A REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK EW MODEL FROM THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS: MACROECONOMIC OPERATION EW INDICATORS, REGIONAL ECONOMIC RISK EW INDICATORS, REGIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION RISK EW INDICATORS. THE MODEL IS EMPIRICALLY RESEARCHED AND ANALYZED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FLUCTUATION TREND OF THE MACROECONOMIC PRESSURE INDEX IN THE TIME SERIES IS RELATIVELY LARGE, AND THE OVERALL FLUCTUATION OF THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC PRESSURE INDEX IS SMALL, AND FLUCTUATES AROUND 0 IN MOST PERIODS. AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STEPPED UP THEIR SUPERVISION OF NON-PERFORMING CORPORATE AND HOUSEHOLD LOANS. FROM 2011 TO 2018, THE NON-PERFORMING LOAN RATIO BEGAN TO DECLINE, AND THE OVERALL FLUCTUATION OF THE REGIONAL FINANCIAL COMPREHENSIVE STRESS INDEX WAS SMALL, FLUCTUATING AROUND 0. DUE TO THE LACK OF LEGAL REGULATION, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE REGIONAL ECONOMY, THE RISK LEVEL IS MORE LIKELY TO CHANGE FROM LOW RISK TO MODERATE RISK, WHILE THE RISK STATUS IS LESS LIKELY TO CHANGE FROM HIGH RISK TO MODERATE RISK. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF REGIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, THE PROBABILITIES OF MAINTAINING LOW RISK AND MODERATE RISK ARE 0.98 AND 0.97, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS STRONGER THAN MAINTAINING THE STABILITY OF HIGH RISK. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE STATE TRANSITION OF THE REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK COMPOSITE INDEX, THE PROBABILITY OF MAINTAINING LOW RISK AND HIGH RISK IS 0.97 AND 0.93, WHICH IS HIGHER THAN MAINTAINING THE STABILITY OF MEDIUM RISK. THE DEEP LEARNING (DL) REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK EW MS-VAR MODEL HAS STRONG RISK PREDICTION ABILITY. THE MODEL CAN BETTER ANALYZE THE CONVERSION PROBABILITY OF REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK EW INDEX AND HAS BETTER RISK EW ABILITY. THIS PAPER ENHANCES THE ROLE OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IN FINANCIAL RISK PREVENTION AND CONTROL. THE REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK EW MODEL INCORPORATING FINANCIAL LEGAL INDICATORS CAN BETTER DESCRIBE THE REGIONAL FINANCIAL RISK LEVEL, AND THE EW RESULTS ARE BASICALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE ACTUAL SITUATION. IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY PREVENT FINANCIAL RISKS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT IMPROVE LOCAL DEBT MANAGEMENT, IMPROVE FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND SYSTEMS, AND IMPROVE THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL LEGAL SUPERVISION.
388	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE BASIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL REGULATION AND LEGAL ANTICIPATION. THE LEGITIMACY OF LEGAL REGULATION DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT CORRESPONDS TO CITIZENS' PERCEPTIONS OF LAW AND, AT THE SAME TIME, THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT PROTECTS NATIONAL SECURITY. THE UNIVERSALITY OF LAW, OUTLINED IN THE ARTICLE, MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE STATISM OF POSITIVISM AND THE METAPHYSICS OF LIBERTARIAN-LEGAL THEORY. THE UNIVERSALITY OF LAW MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM THE ESSENCE OF THE POSITIVIST DOCTRINE AND THE PROPERITY OF THE LIBERTARIAN-LEGAL CONCEPT WITH A CONSTRUCTIVE OUTLET FOR THE FINAL RATIONAL THAT CAPTURES THE INFINITE DIALECTICAL MOVEMENT OF LEGAL MATTER. THE POSITIVIST DUE REFLECTS THE FORMALISED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NORMATIVE ESTABLISHMENT AND ANTICIPATES ITS REALISATION. LIBERTARIAN-LEGAL PROPER PREDICTS THE OPTIMAL, REPRODUCING THE TRUE ESSENCE OF THE NORM. THE RATIONAL TRANSFORMS EQUALITY IN OUGHT (FORMAL EQUALITY) INTO EQUALITY IN BEING (ACTUAL EQUALITY), CONFIRMING THE UNIVERSALITY OF LAW AS AN INDEX OF THE CIRCULATION OF LEGAL MATTER FROM PREDETERMINED NORMATIVITY (PROPER) TO OPTIMALITY (PROPER) AND THE FINAL SUBJECT-PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT (RATIONAL). THE METHODOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF LAW DETERMINES THE EXISTENCE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF OBLIGATORY AND SUFFICIENT CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE EFFECTIVE ACTION OF STATE AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TOWARDS THE PROTECTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, NAMELY: A) THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY; B) THE RETENTION OF PUBLIC POWER WITHIN THE HEGELIAN "BOUNDARIES OF ORDER" - LIMITING ITS INTRUSION INTO THE PRIVATE SPHERE; C) THE EXISTENCE OF INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND GUARANTEES FOR THEIR REALISATION; D) THE CONTINUOUS MODERNISATION OF ALL PARTS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM ACCORDING TO EVOLVING POLITICAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL-MORAL CONDITIONS. IN THIS WAY, THE INTERPLAY OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE DIRECTED DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF A FREE SOCIETY IS GUARANTEED, REFLECTING THE COORDINATED MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND CITIZENS. THE CONCEPT OF UNIVERSALITY OF LAW DEVELOPS A POLEMIC ABOUT THE SYNTHESIS OF POSITIVIST AND LIBERTARIAN-LEGAL TYPES OF LEGAL UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PREDOMINANT IMPORTANCE OF THE SOCIAL VECTOR OF LAW AS AN INTRINSIC PROPERTY OF UNIVERSALITY THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIRM FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIAL STATE - HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AND CONDITIONS OF FREE DEVELOPMENT AND DIGNIFIED LIFE. NORMATIVE LEGAL ACTS PASS THROUGH PEOPLE'S CONSCIOUSNESS IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND ARE LEGITIMISED DEPENDING ON THE CORRESPONDENCE, ON THE ONE HAND, TO THE STATE'S TASKS OF PROTECTING NATIONAL SECURITY AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, TO CITIZENS' HOPES FOR A DECENT LIFE BASED ON THE UNIVERSALITY OF LAW AS A GUARANTEE OF THEIR COMMUNICATION AND MUTUAL SELF-RESTRAINT.
389	BACKGROUND: THIS ARTICLE IS BASED UPON DATA GATHERED DURING A STUDY CONDUCTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ORGANIZATION ON THE PATENT STATUS OF PRODUCTS APPEARING ON THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION'S 2013 MODEL LIST OF ESSENTIAL MEDICINES (MLEM). IT IS A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AIMED AT ANSWERING: IN WHICH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE PATENTS ON ESSENTIAL MEDICINES BEING FILED? METHODS: PATENT DATA WERE COLLECTED BY LINKING THOSE LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA'S MEDICINE PATENT REGISTERS TO CORRESPONDING PATENTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES USING TWO INTERNATIONAL PATENT DATABASES (INPADOC AND DERWENT) VIA A COMMERICAL-GRADE PATENT SEARCH PLATFORM (THOMSON INNOVATION). THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER COMPANIES WERE THEN CONTACTED TO CORRECT AND VERIFY OUR DATA. WE NEXT TALLIED THE NUMBER OF MLEM PATENTS PER DEVELOPING COUNTRY. SPEARMAN CORRELATIONS WERE DONE TO ASSESS BIVARIATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES, AND A MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE NUMBER OF MLEM PATENTS IN EACH COUNTRY USING SPSS 23.0. RESULTS: A SUBSET OF 20 OF THE 375 (5%) PRODUCTS ON THE 2013 MLEM FIT OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE PATENT ESTATE REPORTS (I.E., THE GLOBAL LIST OF PATENTS FOR A GIVEN DRUG) VARIED GREATLY IN THEIR NUMBER WITH A MEDIAN OF 48 PATENTS (INTERQUARTILE RANGE [IQR]: 26-76). THEIR GEOGRAPHIC REACH HAD A MEDIAN OF 15% OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SAMPLED (IQR: 8-28%). THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES COVERED APPEARED TO INCREASE WITH THE AGE OF THE PATENT ESTATE (R =.433, P = 0.028). THE NUMBER OF MLEM PATENTS PER COUNTRY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX (HDI), GROSS DOMESTIC INCOME (GDI) PER CAPITA, TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE PER CAPITA, POPULATION SIZE, THE RULE OF LAW INDEX, AND AVERAGE EDUCATION LEVEL. POPULATION SIZE, GDI PER CAPITA, AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE (IN % OF NATIONAL EXPENDITURE) WERE PREDICTORS OF THE NUMBER OF MLEM PATENTS IN COUNTRIES (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.009, RESPECTIVELY). POPULATION SIZE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR (BETA = 0.59), FOLLOWED BY INCOME (GDI PER CAPITA) (BETA = 0.32), AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE (BETA = 0.15). HOLDING THE OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, (I) 14.3 MILLION MORE PEOPLE, (II) $833.33 MORE PER CAPITA (GDI), OR (III) 0.88% MORE OF NATIONAL SPENDING ON HEALTHCARE RESULTED IN 1 ADDITIONAL ESSENTIAL MEDICINE PATENT. CONCLUSION: POPULATION WAS A POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF THE NUMBER OF PATENT FILINGS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ALONG WITH GDI AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE. THE AGE AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE PATENT ESTATE MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COUNTRIES COVERED. BROAD SURVEILLANCE AND BENCHMARKING OF THE GLOBAL MEDICINE PATENT LANDSCAPE IS VALUABLE FOR DETECTING SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS THAT MAY OCCUR OVER TIME. WITH IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL MEDICINE PATENT TRANSPARENCY BY COMPANIES AND DATA AVAILABLE THROUGH THIRD PARTIES, SUCH STUDIES WILL BE INCREASINGLY FEASIBLE.
390	THE RESEARCH PROBLEM WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER CROSS-LISTING IN THE UNITED STATES IS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN DISCLOSURE DEFICIENCIES ABOUT RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (RPTS) RELATED TO THE LEGAL TRADITIONS OF FIRMS' COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN. MOTIVATION THE EXTANT LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THERE IS A DISCLOSURE DISPARITY ASSOCIATED TO THE FIRMS' LEGAL ORIGIN (CIVIL OR COMMON LAW) AND THE COUNTRIES' INSTITUTIONS (REGULATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND MARKET SCRUTINY). THE LITERATURE HAS NOT EXAMINED WHETHER CROSS-LISTING IN THE UNITED STATES MITIGATES (OR ELIMINATES) THE DISCLOSURE GAP FOR FIRMS FROM CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES AND COUNTRIES WITH WORSE INSTITUTIONS. WE FOCUS ON RPTS BECAUSE THE US SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS PUT PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON REGULATION OF THIS TYPE OF DISCLOSURE. HYPOTHESES H-1: AMONG DOMESTICALLY LISTED FIRMS, THOSE FROM COUNTRIES WITH COMMON LAW TRADITION PRESENT SUPERIOR LEVEL OF RPT DISCLOSURE THAN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH A CIVIL LAW TRADITION. H-2: CROSS-LISTED FIRMS HAVE A SUPERIOR LEVEL OF RPT DISCLOSURE COMPARED TO DOMESTICALLY LISTED FIRMS FROM THE SAME COUNTRY. H-3: AMONG CROSS-LISTED FIRMS, THOSE FROM COUNTRIES WITH COMMON LAW TRADITION PRESENT A SUPERIOR LEVEL OF RPT DISCLOSURE THAN FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES WITH A CIVIL LAW TRADITION. TARGET POPULATION FIRMS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS). WE SAMPLE FIRMS FROM THE G20 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED IFRS BECAUSE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVENESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY. ADOPTED METHODOLOGY ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (OLS) REGRESSIONS WITH FIRM AND INDUSTRY-YEAR FIXED EFFECTS. TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES (INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES) REGRESSIONS TO TACKLE ENDOGENEITY ISSUES. ANALYSES WE MANUALLY COLLECTED DATA FROM THE FINANCIAL REPORTS OF 531 FIRMS FROM THE G20 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED IFRS TO COMPUTE INDICES OF COMPLIANCE WITH DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY IAS 24. WE PERFORMED DOUBLE-DIFFERENCE REGRESSIONS, COMPARING FIRMS ACROSS THEIR LEGAL ORIGIN (COMMON LAW VERSUS CIVIL LAW), AND CROSS-LISTING STATUS (CROSS-LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES VERSUS DOMESTICALLY LISTED ONLY). IN ADDITION, WE STUDIED THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANNELS THAT DRIVE THE DISCLOSURE GAP BETWEEN COMMON AND CIVIL LAW FIRMS. FINDINGS FOR DOMESTICALLY LISTED FIRMS, WE FOUND THAT FIRMS FROM THE COMMON LAW TRADITION HAVE RPT DISCLOSURE LEVELS SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF FIRMS FROM THE CIVIL LAW TRADITION. WE FOUND THAT THE LEVEL OF RPT DISCLOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH COUNTRIES' REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW, AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT FIND ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF RPT DISCLOSURE AMONG FIRMS CROSS-LISTED IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMS' LEGAL ORIGIN OR WITH OTHER HOME-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT AND SCRUTINY OF CAPITAL MARKETS IMPOSED BY THE US MARKET COMPENSATE FOR HOME-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES AND ELIMINATE DIFFERENCES IN FIRMS' RPT DISCLOSURES ACROSS LEGAL ORIGINS.
391	THE POLICY OF UKRAINE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGAN IN 1993, WAS CARRIED OUT ALL THE YEARS OF UKRAINE'S EXISTENCE, AND RECEIVED INTENSIVE DEEPENING WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY - THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES A LIST OF LEGAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND TECHNICAL REGULATIONS, AND DEEP AND COMPREHENSIVE FREE TRADE AREA (DCFTA), IN 2014 AND ITS FINAL SIGNING IN 2017. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES OF THE AGREEMENT ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO THE FUTURE OF BOTH UKRAINE AND THE WHOLE EUROPEAN REGION. THE POLITICAL GOAL IS TO IMPLEMENT EUROPEAN STANDARDS ON THE TERRITORY OF UKRAINE. THIS IMPLIES THE INTRODUCTION OF FUNDAMENTAL EUROPEAN VALUES, NAMELY DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE STANDARDS OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITY SYSTEM. THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT FORESEE MEMBERSHIP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, HOWEVER, DOES NOT EXCLUDE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE FUTURE. THE ECONOMIC GOAL IS TO HELP TO MODERNIZE THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMY BY EXPANDING TRADE VOLUMES WITH THE EU AND OTHER COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS REFORMING ECONOMIC REGULATION MECHANISMS IN LINE WITH THE BEST EUROPEAN PRACTICES. SUBJECT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, UKRAINE WILL BECOME ATTRACTIVE FOR FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INVESTMENT FOR FURTHER PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT TO THE EU AND OTHER MARKETS OF THE WORLD. HARMONIZATION OF STANDARDS AND EUROPEAN REGULATIONS HAS BECOME A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PROCESS THAN THE FULFILMENT OF STRICTLY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND UNDERLIES THE INTRODUCTION OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE WITHOUT CORRUPTION. IN THE PROCESS OF HARMONIZATION OF INTERACTION, AN ADAPTIVE INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM WAS FORMED (THE HIGHEST LEVEL - ANNUAL SUMMITS; THE KEY COORDINATOR IS THE ASSOCIATION COUNCIL, CONSISTING OF MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET OF MINISTERS OF UKRAINE; THE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL COORDINATION - THE ASSOCIATION PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE, WHICH INCLUDES MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VERKHOVNA RADA OF UKRAINE, AND THE CIVIL SOCIETY PLATFORM; IN ORDER TO COORDINATE PROCESSES ON THE TERRITORY OF UKRAINE, THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED A FEW SUPERVISORY COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS). THE HARMONIZATION OF THE ECONOMIC ASPECT OF THE MECHANISM HAS BEEN DETERMINED IN SOLVING ISSUES OF OPENNESS OF MARKETS FOR DUTY-FREE IMPORT FROM UKRAINE IN APRIL 2014, OBTAINING A VISA-FREE REGIME WITH THE EU, ABOLISHING EXPORT-IMPORT TARIFFS, IMPLEMENTING EUROPEAN TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR FOOD SAFETY, PHYTOSANITARY NORMS, COMPETITION POLICY, SERVICE PROVISION, AND PUBLIC PROCUREMENT POLICY. THE ISSUES OF FURTHER DEEPENING OF RELATIONS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE TERMS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS BEFORE THEIR ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION, STABILIZATION OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROCESSES IN THE COUNTRY, AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
392	INCREASE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROBLEM OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S COOPERATION WITH OTHER SUBJECTS DURING PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IS OBJECTIVELY CAUSED BY THE COMPLICATION OF SEPARATE TYPES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, IN PARTICULAR, INTRODUCTION AND WIDE USE OF NEW METHODS, SUCH AS ELECTRONIC AND TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. THE USE OF THE MENTIONED METHOD IN THE SPHERE OF DRUG TRAFFICKING CAUSES SPECIAL ANXIETY. ANOTHER FACTOR OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPIC OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S COOPERATION IS THE FACT THAT IT IS PREDOMINANTLY CONSIDERED AS PART OF THEIR COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT EXECUTING OPERATIONAL SEARCH ACTIVITIES. BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF CLOSE COOPERATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AND SUBJECTS WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM. FINALLY, THE MAIN PROBLEM IS IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PHENOMENON OF COOPERATION. IT SEEMS EFFICIENT TO EXERCISE A COMPLEX ANALYSIS OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S COOPERATION DURING PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING IN DRUG TRAFFICKING, AS AN ELEMENT OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATION. IN DEFINITIONS OF COOPERATION, GIVEN WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THIS APPROACH, IT IS CONSIDERED AS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION ITSELF. DETERMINATION OF ESSENTIAL ORIGINS OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S COOPERATION IN RESPECT OF HIS RELATIONS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS, WHOSE AIM IS NOT CRIME INVESTIGATION, LEADS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS COOPERATION AS MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CONDITIONED BY THE RULE OF LAW, AND IN CASE OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S COOPERATION WITH CITIZENS BY NORMS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. THIS CONCEPTION ALLOWS UNDERLINING THE NECESSITY TO EXERCISE SPECIAL ACTIONS BY THE INVESTIGATOR AND OTHER SUBJECTS IRRESPECTIVELY OF PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND CORPORATE INTERESTS, AND FINALLY EXERCISING A MORE EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF COOPERATIVE FORMS. THE AUTHORS CRITICALLY ASSESS THE POINT OF VIEW ACCORDING TO WHICH CONCURRENCE OF THE INVESTIGATOR'S ACTIONS WITH OTHER SUBJECTS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS COOPERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF INVESTIGATION ORGANIZATION, AND ACCOUNT OF FORMS OF COOPERATION. IT ALLOWS CONSIDERING THAT CONCURRENCE OVER TIME AND PLACE HAS THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE AS CONCURRENCE OVER PURPOSE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT EQUAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE FOR THE INVESTIGATOR COOPERATING WITH A MOBILE NETWORK OPERATOR AND THE PRODUCTION PURPOSE OF THIS OPERATOR WHO HAS NO LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSE WHEN COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATOR. SINCE THE ESSENCE OF COOPERATION WITH THE MENTIONED SUBJECTS IS DETERMINED BY LAW, THE PROBLEM OF ITS REASONABILITY (COST EFFECTIVENESS, SAFETY, EFFICIENCY) CANNOT BE SOLVED BY THESE SUBJECTS, AS IT HAPPENS DURING THE COOPERATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. CONSIDERING THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATOR, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH "CONTROL-COOPERATION", WHICH APPEARS DURING COOPERATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AND THE HEAD OF AN INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY, AND "INSPECTION-COOPERATION", WHICH APPEARS DURING COOPERATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR AND THE PROSECUTOR. MOREOVER, "CONTROL-COOPERATION" IS MORE SUBSTANTIAL THAN "INSPECTION-COOPERATION".
393	EVER SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, THE EU HAS REGULATED EUROPEAN LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY THROUGH A POLICY OF MULTILINGUALISM (ART. 217 OF THE E.C. TREATY AND COUNCIL REGULATION NO 1 APRIL 15, 1958). WITHIN THIS POLICY, THE LEGISLATOR INTRODUCED THE RIGHT OF EU CITIZENS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE EU INSTITUTIONS IN EACH ONE OF THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES. THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTILINGUAL COMMUNICATION WITH THE EU INSTITUTIONS IS NOT ONLY A PRACTICAL SOLUTION, BUT A REAL "CORE" RIGHT, RECOGNIZED EVEN IN THE LISBON TREATY. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, IT IS WORTH PROVIDING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ALSO FAVORING THE ENACTMENT OF RIGHTS AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL, BY FORMULATING, ENFORCING AND EVEN COMMUNICATING THE SAME RULE TO ALL EU CITIZENS, WITH THE AID OF A MULTILINGUAL DRAFTING. THE EU LEGAL TERMINOLOGY PROVIDING RIGHTS COMES INTO BEING THROUGH SPECIFIC MECHANISMS OF LEXICAL CREATION, WHICH CHIEFLY CONSIST OF COINING SEMANTIC NEOLOGISMS. MOREOVER, ALL LEGAL TEXTS MUST BE WRITTEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH EU DRAFTING GUIDELINES, PRESCRIBING THAT "RULES HAVE TO BE DRAFTED BEARING IN MIND THEIR TRANSLATION IN ALL THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGES". THE CONSEQUENCE OF THESE DRAFTING TECHNIQUES IS THAT MULTILINGUALISM INFLUENCES NOT ONLY THE TRANSLATION, BUT THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF THE RULE: VERY OFTEN THE RESULT OF THIS PRAXIS IS A PRAGMATIC, DETAILED, CONCRETE REGULATION OF LEGAL INSTRUMENTS, RATHER THAN A SYSTEM OF RIGHTS. A CLEAR EXAMPLE IS GIVEN BY THE DIRECTIVES ON CONSUMER PROTECTION - NOWADAYS "DIRECTIVE ON CONSUMER RIGHTS" - AND PARTICULARLY THE WELL KNOWN "RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL"; A CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW FROM A CONTRACT WITHIN SEVEN (NOW FOURTEEN) DAYS IS UNDENIABLY A PROPER "RIGHT". HOWEVER, THE REGULATION PROVIDED IN THE DIRECTIVES IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE PROCEDURE OF WITHDRAWAL (THE INSTRUMENT) THAN ON THE EFFECT OF THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE CONTRACT (THE RIGHT). IN GENERAL, THE MULTILINGUAL DRAFTING OF EU NORMS - AND CONSEQUENTLY OF EU RIGHTS - IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY FUNCTIONAL TO THE EFFECTIVE TRANSPOSITION OF RIGHTS IN THE MEMBER STATES AND TO THE SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY OF EU CITIZENS BEFORE EUROPEAN LAW. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THIS PROBLEM - CAUSING A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE EU INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF THE FORMULATION OF EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW AND THE CITIZENS - MIGHT BE APPROACHED THROUGH DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES: LINGUISTIC, ANTHROPOLOGICAL, JURIDICAL. PARTICULARLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF THE EU COMPARATIVE LAW SCIENCE IS EQUIPPED WITH METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS WHICH PROVED TO BE USEFUL FOR BREAKING DOWN THE LEGAL DISCOURSE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION GOING BEYOND ITS WORDS AND HIGHLIGHTING THE VARIOUS "FORMANTS" (NORMS), SOME OF WHICH EXIST AND COME TO LIGHT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTILINGUAL FORMULATION OF EU LAW.
394	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE STRATEGIC ROLE OF WORLD-CLASS UNIVERSITIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC PROFESSION IN THE REGIONALISATION PROJECT OF CHINA'S GREATER BAY AREA (GBA). IT ILLUSTRATES THE WAY IN WHICH THE CASE OF THE GBA REGIONALISATION PROJECT OFFERS A POTENTIALLY RICH EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE FOR ADDING CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING TO THE LITERATURE OF THE TRIPLE HELIX MODEL, WHICH LARGELY DRAWS ON INDUCTIVE THEORISING FROM WESTERN SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION CASES. THE GBA REGIONALISATION PROCESSES WILL PROVIDE A WEALTH OF EMPIRICAL CASES FOR IDENTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ADDRESS TENSIONS AND INCREASE INTERACTIONS IN THE TRIPLE HELIX RELATIONSHIP OF UNIVERSITY, GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY FOR FOSTERING KNOWLEDGE SYNERGIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH FOCUSING ON THE CASE OF HONG KONG, IT ENGAGES IN POLICY AND STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS AND ADDRESSES THREE KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS: WHAT ARE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ROLE OF HONG KONG'S UNIVERSITIES AND ACADEMIC PROFESSION IN THE REGIONALISATION OF INNOVATION SYSTEMS IN THE GBA? WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGIONALISATION PROCESSES? WHAT ARE THE EXPECTED OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OFFERED BY THE GBA POLICY INITIATIVES FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF HONG KONG'S UNIVERSITIES AND ACADEMIC PROFESSION? FINDINGS HONG KONG, GIVEN ITS STATUS AS AN INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CENTRE AND GLOBAL CITY WITH INTENSE INTERNATIONALISATION AND ESTABLISHED JUDICIAL SYSTEM OPERATED BY THE RULE OF LAW, WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE GBA DEVELOPMENT BY LEVERAGING ON ITS EDGE IN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH THROUGH THE WORLD-CLASS ACADEMIC PROFESSION. SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS IN THE CITY, POSSESSING THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF BASIC RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS, ARE HIGHLY REGARDED BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. THE ENGAGEMENT OF HONG KONG'S SCIENTIFIC TALENTS, CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ACHIEVING CHINA'S ASPIRATION OF BECOMING A GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY POWER. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS ANALYSIS OF THIS ARTICLE IMPLIES THAT THE GBA CONCEPT IS CURRENTLY CHINA'S AMBITIOUS BUT VAGUE ECONOMIC PLAN. THE OPPORTUNITIES IN WHICH KEY NODE CITIES AND KNOWLEDGE/ INNOVATION CLUSTERS WILL CAPTURE AND CAPITALISE FROM THE REGIONAL 'CO-OPETITIVE" 'ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM ARE STILL UNCLEAR. THE FUTURE OF THE GBA REGIONALISATION IS SO DYNAMIC AND OPEN-ENDED THAT GROUNDED CONCEPTS RELATED TO THE GOVERNANCE INNOVATION/ DISCOURSE OF 'ONE COUNTRY TWO SYSTEMS' AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND CAPITALISATION WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS WILL HELP IN MAKING SENSE OF THE CONTEXTUALISATION OF A CHINESE REGIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEM AND ENHANCING THE SOPHISTICATION OF RECONCEPTUALISATION OF THE TRIPLE HELIX MODEL. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS ARTICLE WILL ADD TO THE LITERATURE SOME NOVEL CONTEXTUALISED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE GBA'S POTENTIAL TRIPLE-HELIX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT-UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY IN THE 21ST CENTURY. THE EMPIRICAL EXAMPLE OF CHINA'S GBA WILL ALSO SHED LIGHT ON A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL CAPITAL IN THE ENTREPRENEURIAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY, DYNAMICS BETWEEN BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH, AND A SYNERGISTIC INTERFACE BETWEEN REGIONALISATION AND NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEM.
395	INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY DEALS WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL NATURE OF REFERENDUM IN ITS OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEANINGS. REFERENDUM AS A CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL FORM OF EXERCISING POWER BY THE PEOPLE APPEARS TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE AND ONE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM COMPONENTS. THE LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE REFLECTS THE OBJECTIVE MEANING OF REFERENDUM, WHICH IS EXPRESSED, ON THE ONE HAND, IN THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO REQUIRE THAT THE STATE TAKES MEASURES TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT TO REFERENDUM AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, IN THE DUTY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE REGULATION AND PROTECTION OF THIS RIGHT. IN ITS SUBJECTIVE MEANING, REFERENDUM DETERMINES THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO PARTICIPATE IN A REFERENDUM RELATED TO ITS INITIATION, PREPARATION AND RUNNING, VOTING, ETC. THE SUBJECTIVE RIGHT GIVES RISE TO THE OBLIGATION OF STATE BODIES AND OFFICIALS TO GUARANTEE THE STATUS OF A CITIZEN BOTH AS A PERSON WHO HOLDS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITY AND AS A PERSON WHO EXERCISES IT IN PRACTICE. PURPOSE: TO SUBSTANTIATE THE CURRENT RELEVANCE OF THE CHOSEN RESEARCH TOPIC; TO PERFORM A COMPARATIVE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 'REFERENDUM' CONCEPT; TO SHOW THAT THE OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE MEANINGS OF THE 'REFERENDUM' INSTITUTION ARE THE OBLIGATORY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEMOCRACY REGIME, WHICH ARE INTEGRATED AT THE SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL AND APPEAR TO BE THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETY. METHODS: THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE DIALECTIC METHOD AS A COMMONLY EMPLOYED SCIENTIFIC TOOL; THERE ARE USED GENERAL SCIENTIFIC (ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, GENERALIZATION, COMPARISON, SYSTEM STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS) AND SPECIFIC SCIENTIFIC (FORMAL LEGAL, FORMAL LOGICAL, STRUCTURAL FUNCTIONAL) METHODS OF COGNITION. RESULTS: THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENT OF THE 'REFERENDUM' CONCEPT IN ITS OBJECTIVE (ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) AND SUBJECTIVE (ARTICLE 32 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION) ASPECTS IS DETERMINED. THE KEY POWERS OF THE PEOPLE AS A SUBJECT OF REFERENDUM LAW AND OF A CITIZEN AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE REFERENDUM PROCESS ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE IS SUBSTANTIATED THE NECESSITY OF POLLING ON THE ISSUES PUT TO A REFERENDUM AND THEIR DISCUSSION AS THE OBLIGATORY PRELIMINARY STAGES OF THE POPULAR VOTE (POLL - DISCUSSION - REFERENDUM). CONCLUSIONS: IN ITS OBJECTIVE MEANING, REFERENDUM IS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE AND THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPONENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. DUE TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND FROM THE STATE, STATE AUTHORITIES AND AUTHORIZED OFFICIALS TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES AND CREATE CONDITIONS FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO REFERENDUM, INCLUDING SETTLEMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO REFERENDUM. IN ITS SUBJECTIVE MEANING, REFERENDUM IS A SYSTEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL GUARANTEES FOR THE RIGHT OF EVERY ELIGIBLE CITIZEN TO PARTICIPATE IN A REFERENDUM. THIS RIGHT RESTRICTS STATE POWER AND OBLIGES THE STATE TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT THE STATUS OF A PERSON AS A SUBJECT THAT EXERCISES THIS RIGHT.
396	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IN UKRAINE. TO THIS END, THE FOLLOWING TASKS HAVE BEEN SET AND SOLVED: AN ASSESSMENT OF THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IN UKRAINE HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT, WHICH INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL INDICES CHARACTERISING THE QUALITY OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FURTHER SELECTION OF INDICATORS THAT ARE INFORMATIVE ABOUT CONVERGENT/DIVERGENT PROCESSES IN THE COUNTRY; FACTORS SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONAL DIVERGENCE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED; RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO OFFSET THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONAL DIVERGENCE. METHODOLOGY. THE METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY IS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF PROCESSES AND PHENOMENA, INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMIC THEORY, SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF THE CLASSICS OF ECONOMIC SCIENCE, LEADING MODERN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN SCHOLARS ON THE PROBLEMS OF INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY. RESULTS. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESSENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE/DIVERGENCE AS A PHENOMENON CHARACTERISING THE LOCAL REPLACEMENT OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS BY INFORMAL ONES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNACCEPTABLE CONTENT OF FORMAL RULES FOR A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF CITIZENS AND/OR THE LOW RISK OF BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR VIOLATION HAS BEEN FURTHER DEVELOPED. THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IN UKRAINE IS ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF INTERNATIONAL INDICES (WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS, THE RULE OF LAW INDEX, THE INTERNATIONAL PROPERTY RIGHT INDEX). IT IS NOTED THAT THE INDICATOR OF THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IN UKRAINE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROJECTS, SINCE THE USEFULNESS OF SUCH ACTIONS FOR SOCIETY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCE SPENDING DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PUBLIC IS READY TO ACCEPT ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INITIATIVES. RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE BY REDUCING THE ASYMMETRY OF INFORMATION IN THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE ASYMMETRY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE HIGH COST OF INFORMATION TRANSMISSION AND INVOLVEMENT OF SUBJECTS IN COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. IT IS PROPOSED TO DIGITISE THE SYSTEMIC COMMUNICATION CHANNELS BETWEEN THE STATE, BUSINESS AND SOCIETY, WHICH WILL MAKE THE COSTS OF ATTRACTING AND TRANSMITTING INFORMATION CLOSE TO ZERO. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. A SCIENTIFIC AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO INCREASING THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IS DEVELOPED. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE IN UKRAINE IS PROPOSED, WHICH INVOLVES THE SELECTION OF INFORMATIVE INDICATORS OF CONVERGENT/DIVERGENT PROCESSES IN THE COUNTRY FROM INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY INDICES AND THE SYSTEMATISATION OF THE INFORMATION OBTAINED. THE CONCEPT OF INCREASING THE LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL CONVERGENCE, WHICH INCLUDES THE DIGITALISATION OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, IS DEVELOPED.
397	THIS RESEARCH EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF HEALTH EXPENDITURES ON HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS). THE STUDY EMPLOYED PANEL DATA FROM 2001 TO 2020 OF ALL ECOWAS MEMBER STATES (15 COUNTRIES) AND TESTED THE DATASETS FOR THE PRESENCE OF A UNIT ROOT AFTER THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS ANALYSIS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT. BASED ON THE RESULT OF THE AUGMENTED DICKEY-FULLER STATIONARITY TEST, THE FULLY MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES (FMOLS) METHOD WAS APPLIED. THE RESULT SHOWED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND INDIRECTLY RELATED TO LIFE EXPECTANCY. ON THE OTHER HAND, PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE, PRIVATE HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND EXTERNAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED WITH INFANT MORTALITY. PUBLIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE WAS FOUND TO BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO INFANT MORTALITY WHILE PRIVATE HEALTH AND EXTERNAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES WERE NEGATIVELY RELATED. IN THE LIGHT OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT POLICYMAKERS IN THE ECOWAS REGION SHOULD DEVOTE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THEIR ANNUAL BUDGETS TO HEALTHCARE AS A STRATEGY TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES, REDUCE UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY RATES, AND INCREASE LIFE EXPECTANCY IN THE REGION.
398	THE FOURTH AMENDMENT'S PROBABLE CAUSE REQUIREMENT IS NOT ABOUT NUMBERS OR STATISTICS. IT IS ABOUT REQUIRING THE POLICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DECISIONS. FOR A THEORY OF WRONGDOING TO SATISFY PROBABLE CAUSE-AND WARRANT A SEARCH OR SEIZURE-IT MUST BE PLAUSIBLE. THE POLICE MUST BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE OBSERVED FACTS INVITE AN INFERENCE OF WRONGDOING, AND JUDGES MUST HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SCRUTINIZE THAT EXPLANATION. UNTIL RECENTLY, THE EXPLANATORY ASPECT OF FOURTH AMENDMENT SUSPICION-" PLAUSIBLE CAUSE"-HAS BEEN UNCONTROVERSIAL, AND CENTRAL TO THE SUPREME COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE, FOR A SIMPLE REASON: EXPLANATIONS HAVE SERVED, IN PRACTICE, AS A GUARANTOR OF STATISTICAL LIKELIHOOD. IN OTHER WORDS, FORCING POLICE TO ARTICULATE THEORIES OF WRONGDOING IS THE MEANS BY WHICH COURTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY ENSURED THAT (ROUGHLY) THE RIGHT " PERSONS, HOUSES, PAPERS, AND EFFECTS" ARE TARGETED FOR INTRUSION. GOING FORWARD, HOWEVER, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE PROMISES TO DISRUPT THE HARMONY BETWEEN EXPLANATORY STANDARDS AND STATISTICAL ACCURACY. POWERFUL MACHINES ENABLE A PREVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE COMBINATION: ACCURATE PREDICTIONS UNACCOMPANIED BY EXPLANATIONS. AS THAT CHANGE TAKES HOLD, WE WILL NEED TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT WHY EXPLANATION-GIVING MATTERS. WHEN JUDGES ASSESS THE SUFFICIENCY OF EXPLANATIONS OFFERED BY POLICE (AND OTHER OFFICIALS), WHAT ARE THEY DOING? IF THE ANSWER COMES BACK TO ERRORREDUCTION- IF THE POINT OF JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT IS SIMPLY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF ACCURATE DECISIONS-MACHINES COULD THEORETICALLY DO THE JOB AS WELL AS, IF NOT BETTER THAN, HUMANS. BUT IF THE ANSWER INVOLVES NORMATIVE GOALS BEYOND ERROR-REDUCTION, AUTOMATED TOOLS-NO MATTER THEIR POWER-WILL REMAIN, AT BEST, PARTIAL SUBSTITUTES FOR JUDICIAL SCRUTINY. THIS ARTICLE DEFENDS THE LATTER VIEW. I ARGUE THAT STATISTICAL ACCURACY, THOUGH IMPORTANT, IS NOT THE CRUX OF EXPLANATION-GIVING. RATHER, EXPLANATORY STANDARDS-LIKE PROBABLE CAUSE-HOLD OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE TO A PLURALITY OF SOMETIMES-CONFLICTING CONSTITUTIONAL AND RULE-OF-LAW VALUES THAT, IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM, BOUND THE SCOPE OF LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY. ERROR-REDUCTION IS ONE SUCH VALUE. BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS, AND SOMETIMES THE VALUES WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES. WHEN JUDGES ASSESS EXPLANATIONS, THEY NAVIGATE A SPACE OF VALUEPLURALISM: THEY IDENTIFY WHICH VALUES ARE AT STAKE IN A GIVEN DECISIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND ASK, WHERE NECESSARY, IF THOSE VALUES HAVE BEEN PROPERLY BALANCED. UNEXPLAINED DECISIONS RENDER THIS PROCESS IMPOSSIBLE AND, IN SO DOING, HOBBLE THE JUDICIAL ROLE. ULTIMATELY, THAT ROLE HAS LESS TO DO WITH ANALYTIC POWER THAN PRACTICED WISDOM. A COMMON ARGUMENT AGAINST REPLACING JUDGES, AND OTHER HUMAN EXPERTS, WITH INTELLIGENT MACHINES IS THAT MACHINES ARE NOT (YET) INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE. IN THE AGE OF POWERFUL ALGORITHMS, HOWEVER, THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A WEAK-AND TEMPORALLY LIMITED-CLAIM. THE BETTER ARGUMENT, I SUGGEST IN CLOSING, IS THAT JUDGING IS NOT SOLELY, OR EVEN PRIMARILY, ABOUT INTELLIGENCE. IT IS ABOUT PRUDENCE.
399	THE SUCCESSION OF MILITARY COUPS AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTIONS IN RECENT FIJIAN HISTORY POSES NUMEROUS PROBLEMS, BOTH URGENT PRACTICAL ONES AND COMPLEX THEORETICAL ONES. ONE SET OF THEORETICAL QUESTIONS CONCERNS THE ISSUE OF LEGAL CONTINUITY AND DISCONTINUITY WITHIN A PARTICULAR SOCIETY OR LEGAL SYSTEM. ANOTHER SET OF SUCH QUESTIONS CONCERNS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE CUSTOMS AND SOCIAL CONVENTIONS OF NON-WESTERN SOCIETIES. IN THEIR APPLICATION TO FIJI, BOTH SETS OF QUESTIONS ARE INTERRELATED, FOR THE LACK OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY THAT FIJI HAS EXPERIENCED CANNOT PROPERLY BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT APPRECIATING THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES ON THE OPERATION OF FIJI'S CONSTITUTION AND LEGAL SYSTEM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS IN THE LITERATURE TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS OF CONTINUITY/DISCONTINUITY AND OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMAL AND CUSTOMARY LAW. HLA HART SOUGHT TO ADDRESS BOTH SETS OF QUESTIONS IN A THEORETICALLY AND DESCRIPTIVELY INTEGRATED WAY. LAW, FOR HART, IS A SPECIAL KIND OF SOCIAL RULE, DISTINGUISHED FROM MERE CUSTOMS AND CONVENTIONS BECAUSE IT FORMS PART OF A FORMAL LEGAL SYSTEM, THE IDENTITY OF WHICH IS ASCERTAINED BY REFERENCE TO THE 'RULE OF RECOGNITION'. ON HART'S ACCOUNT, A FULLY EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION OCCURS WHEN THERE IS THE SUBSTITUTION OF ONE RULE OF RECOGNITION FOR ANOTHER. HART THUS HAS AN ACCOUNT OF LEGAL REVOLUTION. HOWEVER, IT IS AN ACCOUNT THAT DEPENDS UPON A THEORETICALLY LADEN DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN DISCRETE SOCIAL PRACTICES. THE SUCCESSION OF COUPS AND REVOLUTIONS IN RECENT FIJIAN HISTORY OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE APPLICABILITY OF THESE ASPECTS OF HART'S THEORY TO A DIFFICULT CASE EXAMPLE. LIKE MANY SIMILAR COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND ELSEWHERE, FIJI HAS A STRONG SET OF TRADITIONAL CUSTOMS AND MORES CO-EXISTING IN A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH A FORMAL SYSTEM OF LAW. IN ADDITION, HOWEVER, FIJI HAS UNDERGONE A SERIES OF COUPS AND REVOLUTIONS WHICH HAVE CHALLENGED THE FORMAL SYSTEM OF LAW AND DEMONSTRATED THE CONTINUING FORCE OF THE TRADITIONAL SOURCES OF POWER WITHIN THE COUNTRY. CAN HART'S THEORY ACCOUNT FOR THE STATE OF THE 'LAW' IN FIJI? THAT IS THE QUESTION WE ADDRESS IN THIS ARTICLE. IN PARTICULAR, WE USE QUALITATIVE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM INTERVIEWS WITH A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF PARTICIPANTS WITHIN FIJIAN SOCIETY TO TEST WHETHER HART'S ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS HOLD TRUE. WE FIND THAT IN CERTAIN IMPORTANT RESPECTS THEY DO NOT. WE CONCLUDE, IN ESSENCE, THAT AN INTERESTING PARADOX EXISTS: THAT THE DESCRIPTIVE INADEQUACY OF HART'S THEORY LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT INCORPORATES A SET OF NORMATIVE VALUES ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW THAT ARE NOT GENERALLY SHARED, AT LEAST IN NOT QUITE THE SAME WAY, BY THE PEOPLE OF FIJI.
400	RECENT STUDIES OF THE POST-LIBERALISATION INDIAN METROPOLIS HAVE LARGELY FOLLOWED A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FROM CONTEMPORARY URBAN SOCIOLOGY IN THE WEST, DRAWN FROM DAVID HARVEY, MANUEL CASTELLS AND SASKIA SASSEN, AMONG OTHERS. THESE STUDIES SHOW THE CONTEMPORARY CITY BEING SHAPED BY GLOBAL TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL-WHICH ACCUMULATES WEALTH THROUGH DISPOSSESSION-RESULTING IN A CLEARING OF THE POOR AND MARGINAL FROM CENTRAL URBAN AREAS TO THE PERIPHERY, AND REPLACING THEM WITH MIDDLE- AND UPPER-CLASS NEWCOMERS. CONCOMITANTLY, NEW JOBS IN THESE CITIES HAVE SHIFTED FROM INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING TO POST-INDUSTRIAL SERVICES FOR LARGE TRANSNATIONAL FIRMS CONNECTED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS OF GLOBAL CAPITAL. THESE THEORIES SUGGEST THAT IN THE NEOLIBERAL CITY THE WELFARE STATE HAS RECEDED, SURRENDERING ITS ROLE OF PROTECTING WORKING-CLASS HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT TO THE INTERESTS OF TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL. WE ARGUE THAT BY IDENTIFYING PROCESSES THAT UNFOLD IN NEW YORK OR PARIS IN NEW DELHI, THESE STUDIES ONLY CAPTURE A SMALL PART OF THE PICTURE OF URBAN TRANSFORMATION IN CONTEMPORARY INDIA. IN THE CASE OF NEW DELHI, WE SHOW HOW ECONOMIC LIBERALISATION HAS FUNDAMENTALLY RESTRUCTURED INDIA'S CAPITAL CITY, PRODUCING A NEW ITERATION OF THE ANCIENT METROPOLIS, WHICH WE CALL THE "TENTH DELHI''. HOWEVER, THE NEW ORDER DOES NOT, FOR THE MOST PART, RESEMBLE THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED WESTERN-DERIVED THEORIES. INSTEAD OF JETTISONING ITS POOR, DELHI HAS BECOME A MAGNET FOR THE WORKING CLASSES FROM ACROSS INDIA. THERE ARE NOW MORE MIGRANTS EACH YEAR TO DELHI THAN TO ANY OTHER INDIAN CITY. INSTEAD OF THE PERIPHERY, OR SQUATTER SETTLEMENTS ON THE URBAN EDGE, THE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS IS FOUND IN THE OLDEST SETTLEMENTS OF THE CITY, THE SO-CALLED LAL DORA AREAS OR "URBAN VILLAGES'', WHERE NEW FORMS OF RENTAL HOUSING HAVE EMERGED. THE CASES OF DISPLACEMENT AND DISPOSSESSION IN DELHI ARE WELL DOCUMENTED, BUT LITTLE HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE MORE LARGE-SCALE PHENOMENA OF "REGULARISATION'' WHERE HUNDREDS OF THE "UNAUTHORISED'' HOUSING COLONIES THAT EXIST ACROSS THE CITY HAVE BEEN FORMALLY REGULARISED. THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF ONE NEIGHBOURHOOD CALLED TAIMOOR NAGAR, WHICH CONTAINS A PATCHWORK OF MULTIPLE TYPES OF SPACES, POPULATIONS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS WORK AT A SMALL SCALE TO EXPLAIN A LARGER SYSTEM, AND TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS THAT REPEAT ACROSS URBAN SPACE IN TERMS OF SPATIAL ORDERING, INFORMAL NORMS, ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND POLITICAL CHANGE. WE ARGUE THAT CAPITAL-INTENSIVE DISPOSSESSION HAS NOT BEEN THE PRIMARY FORM OF URBAN TRANSFORMATION IN POST-LIBERALISATION NEW DELHI. THE LIBERALISATION OF STATE CONTROL OVER SPACES AND TYPES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE EXPANSION OF DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED REPRESENTATION IN THIS PERIOD HAS ALSO BEEN DRAMATICALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN MOST OF THE ECONOMY IS UNREGULATED, AND MOST OF URBAN SPACE IS UNPLANNED, DEMOCRATIC POLITICS MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBAN CITIZENS AND THE RULE OF LAW.
401	THE GERMAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (GTZ) HAS SUPPORTED THE LEGAL TRANSITION OF CHINA ON BEHALF OF THE GERMAN MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT SINCE 1994. LABOR AND SOCIAL SECURITY LAW WERE THE FIRST AREAS OF COOPERATION, FOLLOWED BY ECONOMIC LAW, CIVIL LAW, BUDGET AND TAX LAW, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND TO A SMALLER EXTENT CRIMINAL LAW. WHILE THE ORIGINAL FOCUS WAS ON LEGISLATION, SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAW IS ASSUMING A BIGGER ROLE. LEGISLATION IN CHINA DOES NOT INITIATE, BUT RATHER CONSOLIDATES DEVELOPMENT. THE STRUGGLE TOWARDS AN INSOLVENCY LAW SHOWS THAT A PRIVATE SECTOR WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE ECONOMY AND THAT STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES WERE TRANSFORMED WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE REGULATIONS ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF NONPAYMENT. IT IS ONLY AFTER MAJOR RESTRUCTURINGS THAT THE INSOLVENCY LAW WILL REGULATE FUTURE PRACTICE CONCERNING NON PERFORMING DEBTS (THESIS 1). THE CHINESE LEGISLATOR IS A STRONG, AUTONOMOUS DECISION-MAKER IN RESPECT OF ADVICE PROVIDED BY PARTNER INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, DESPITE RECEIVING ADVICE THAT A COMPREHENSIVE INSOLVENCY LAW IS NECESSARY AS THE BASIS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, LEGISLATION IN THIS REGARD FOLLOWED ITS OWN CHINESE PATH OF DEVELOPMENT (2). LEGAL COOPERATION NEEDS JUSTIFICATION. WHILE PROGRESS CAN EASILY BE ANALYZED ON THE WRITTEN LEVEL, CHANGES IN PRACTICE ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE (3). (PURELY) TECHNICAL ADVICE IS GENERALLY OPENLY ACCEPTED. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS ACHIEVING NON-CONTRADICTORY REGULATIONS THAT CAN SERVE AS A BASIS FOR THE RULE OF LAW (4). MANY AGENCIES ARE WORKING IN CHINA. SINCE CHINESE INSTITUTIONS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY INTERESTED IN COORDINATING THESE ACTIVITIES, AGENCY COORDINATION IS NECESSARY, BUT OFTEN PRACTICALLY DIFFICULT DUE TO NATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS (5). THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN CHINA IS, AT LEAST ON PAPER, FINISHED. HOWEVER, WHILE MANY LAWS, ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE THE ECONOMIC SECTOR, HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY TRANSFORMED TO MEET THE NEW NEEDS OF THE NEW ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, CONFLICTING REGULATIONS AND PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION ARE CURRENTLY THE MAIN ISSUES WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED (6). LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES HAVE ALSO CHANGED THE GENERAL POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF CHINA. IN PARTICULAR, THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS HAS GAINED MORE IMPORTANCE (7). ALTHOUGH IMPLEMENTATION IS A PROBLEM, IT DOES TAKE PLACE. CHINA IS NOT A COUNTRY WHERE LAWS ARE WRITTEN BUT UNIMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE. THIS CAN EASILY BE SEEN IN THE RISING TAX REVENUE BEING COLLECTED YEARLY ON THE BASIS OF A MOSTLY UNCHANGED TAX LAW. FURTHERMOREACCESS TO LAW HAS INCREASED AND THE PUBLIC HAS PARTICIPATED IN LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES (8). THE BUILDING OF A COURT SYSTEM IN THE LAST 20 YEARS IS IMPRESSIVE. HERE, HOWEVER, MANY TASKS STILL LIE AHEAD (9). GTZ HAS SUPPORTED MANY OF THESE CHANGES. WHILE DOING THIS IT HAS CHANGED, MOVING FROM LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TOWARDS PROVIDING SUPPORT IN IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS FOSTERING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN CHINESE INSTITUTIONS (10).
402	THE OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION IS TRADITIONALLY LINKED TO THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. IN ADDITION TO THIS GENERAL NOTION, FOR THE COUNTRIES FROM SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE THE OMBUDSMAN IS A BODY RELATED TO THE PROCESS OF TRANSITION TO RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES. IN THESE COUNTRIES THE OMBUDSMAN HAS ALSO THE SPECIFIC TASK OF MAINTAINING THE SOCIAL AND ETHNIC PEACE AND SECURITY. THE OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTIONS IN THIS REGION HAVE ALSO A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE PROCESS OF ACCESSION TO THE EU AND ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AS THE HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION IS IN THE HEART OF THESE ORGANISATIONS. THE COOPERATION AMONG OMBUDSMEN IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR TASKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CHALLENGING HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WITH TRANS-BORDER CONNOTATIONS. HOWEVER THE LACK OF A COMMON MODEL FOR THE OMBUDSMEN INSTITUTIONS, THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MANDATE AND FUNCTIONS AND EVEN THE DIVERSE TITLE OF THESE BODIES, PROVES TO BE A SERIOUS HINDRANCE TO EFFICIENT COLLABORATION AND HENCE TO THE EFFICIENT PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AT REGIONAL LEVEL. THIS IS WHY THE EXISTENCE OF INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS FOR THE OMBUDSMEN INSTITUTIONS FROM SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE IS IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE NEED TO BRING THEM CLOSER TO EACH OTHER BUT ALSO CLOSER TO THE SUCCESSFUL MODEL OF A HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION BODY. THE NATIONAL STATUS OF THE OMBUDSMAN IS INFLUENCED BY THE INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS EXISTING IN THIS FIELD, DUE TO THE TIGHT LINK WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REGULATIONS. AMONG THESE STANDARDS THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT SOURCES WHICH CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS THE EFFICIENCY OF OMBUDSMAN IS CONCERNED. THE PARIS PRINCIPLES OF THE UN ARE ADOPTED IN 1993 AND ARE RELATED TO THE REQUIREMENT OF INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIALITY, FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND AS BROAD MANDATE AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION INSTITUTIONS. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF ALL POSSIBLE HUMAN RIGHTS, INFRINGED BY BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. A STATUS "A" INDICATES COMPLIANCE WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FOR A HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTION. SAME PRINCIPLES ARE REGULATED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION FOR DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW. THE PROCESS OF BRINGING THE INSTITUTIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PARIS PRINCIPLES AND VENICE COMMISSION RULES IS ALREADY ON-GOING FOR THE COUNTRIES OF SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE. THE CONTEMPORARILY CONCEPT OF THE OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTION REQUIRES IT TO BE PROACTIVE, OPEN AND TRANSPARENT, CLOSER TO CITIZENS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THEIR NEEDS AND TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THEM AND THE MALFUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS. THE MODERN CHALLENGES OF THE OMBUDSMEN ARE RELATED TO THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE MORE URGENT NEED OF LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE, WHICH PROVES TO BE INEVITABLE IN THE CONTEXT OF POLICY MAKING PROCESSES.
403	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONSIDER THE FEATURES OF EDUCATION OF PERSONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTH NEEDS (SHN) IN MODERN RUSSIA HAVING ANALYZED THE NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAW AND THEIR ACTUAL OBSERVANCE IN PRACTICE. THE ARTICLE USES DATA COLLECTED BY THE AUTHOR FROM VARIOUS SOURCES THAT DO NOT HAVE A SYSTEMATIC NATURE OF THEIR PRESENTATION. IN STUDIES OF EDUCATION OF PERSONS WITH SHN, MANY RUSSIAN AUTHORS PRESENT ADVANTAGES AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THE COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS: EDUCATION AT SPECIALIZED SCHOOLS AND INCLUSIVE EDUCATION. INCLUSIVE EDUCATION IN RUSSIA, UNLIKE IN MANY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, HAS STARTED DEVELOPING, AS EMPHASIZED IN THE ARTICLE, RATHER RECENTLY. IN RUSSIAN EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, MANY OFFICIALS WITHOUT SPECIAL TRAINING MISTAKENLY TREAT INCLUSIVE EDUCATION AS CARELESS INCLUSION OF PERSONS WITH SHN IN GROUPS OF STUDENTS RATHER THAN AS HARD WORK WITH THEM, SO THAT THEY PROGRESS IN TRAINING, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FEATURES OF THEIR HEALTH AND MENTALITY (SLUGGISHNESS, ABSENT-MINDEDNESS, LIMITED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHERS). WITHOUT STATE AND PUBLIC CONTROL OVER THE OBSERVANCE OF THE CURRENT STANDARDS OF THE RULE OF LAW, PERSONS WITH SHN WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED IN THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHT OF TO A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION. AT THE SAME TIME, THE LACK OF ASSISTANCE IN EDUCATION TO PERSONS WITH SHN IS SHOWN AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS OF EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRIES WITH LOW AND AVERAGE INCOME. AT PRESENT, THERE IS NO INTEGRATED APPROACH TO CARRYING OUT THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE REALIZATION BY PERSONS WITH SHN OF THEIR RIGHTS TO HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION AT ALL LEVELS; THERE IS LITTLE COMPETENT INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON. IN THIS REGARD, MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE MONITORING OF THE REALIZATION BY PERSONS WITH SHN OF THEIR RIGHT TO EDUCATION. THE ADOPTION OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS IN THE FIELD OF REGULATION OF MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN EDUCATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS WITH SHN TO ENTER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ON DISABLED PEOPLE QUOTAS FOR THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH COURSES OF STUDY ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT. THE AUTHOR COMES TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS. IT IS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME THE LACK OF STANDARDIZATION OF THE RIGHTS OF DISABLED PERSONS AND PEOPLE WITH SHN WHEN THEY RECEIVE AN EDUCATION. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY OF THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF IMPLEMENTING THE LAWS ON THE EDUCATION OF DISABLED PERSONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL ITS SPECIFICITY IS UNDERESTIMATED. THERE ARE NO DIVERSE QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS OF THE QUALITY OF SUPPORT FOR DISABLED PERSONS IN EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR ITS CONTINUOUS MONITORING. THE EDUCATION PROCESS OF DISABLED PERSONS IN RUSSIA HAS A CLOSED NATURE, WITH A LOW LEVEL OF OFFICIALS' SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE RIGHTS OF DISABLED PERSONS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, FACTUAL DISCRIMINATION OF THE SITUATION OF MANY PEOPLE WITH SHN AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION OF PEOPLE WITH SHN.
404	SINCE THE 1980S, REFORMS HAVE DOMINATED GOVERNMENT AGENDAS AROUND THE WORLD; GOVERNMENTS EMBARKED ON A REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF INNOVATION. THE PACE OF REFORM IS NOT LIKELY TO ABATE. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES CALL FOR THE ACTIVE CONTRIBUTION OF MANY ACTORS ACROSS AND BEYOND GOVERNMENT AND REQUIRE GOVERNMENT TO WORK OUTSIDE OF CONVENTIONAL BOUNDARIES. THEY COMPEL GOVERNMENT TO USE ITS AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES TO ENABLE AND EMPOWER OTHERS. INCREASED COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY WITHIN POLICY ISSUES AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXTS ARE PROMPTING GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE, INTERVENE, INNOVATE, LEARN, AND ADAPT. FUTURE REFORMS WILL NECESSITATE AN EXPANDED VIEW OF THE ROLES OF GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS. WHILE GOVERNMENT REMAINS THE STEWARD OF COLLECTIVE INTEREST WITH THE POWER TO INTERVENE, GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EXPLORE HOW IT CAN WORK WITH CITIZENS AND OTHER ACTORS TO PRODUCE RESULTS OF HIGH PUBLIC VALUE AS GOVERNMENTS MOVE TOWARDS PRODUCING RESULTS WITH CITIZENS, THEY STRIKE A MORE COMPLETE SET OF RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPAND THE REPERTOIRE OF ROLES EACH CAN PLAY TO ACHIEVE RESULTS. THESE REFORMS WILL ALLOW A BROADER DEFINITION OF PUBLIC RESULTS THAT EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF BOTH PUBLIC POLICY AND CIVIC RESULTS. THE LATTER BUILD CREDIBILITY, WHILE THE FORMER INCREASE LEGITIMACY. BOTH ENHANCE CITIZENS' TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS HAVE THUS FAR BEEN WORKING FROM AN INCOMPLETE DEFINITION OF RESULTS THAT DOES NOT GIVE SUFFICIENT WEIGHT TO CIVIC RESULTS. FINALLY, FUTURE REFORMS WILL ALSO REQUIRE A MORE DYNAMIC UNDERSTANDING OF GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THAT SUPPORTS THE BUILDING OF CAPACITY. CAPACITY BUILDING IN NEW AREAS IS REQUIRED TO PURSUE THE PUBLIC GOOD IN AN INCREASINGLY UNPREDICTABLE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, BUT THIS WORK MUST BEGIN BY VALUING AND PRESERVING EXISTING CAPACITIES. CENTRAL AMONG THESE IS THE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE, THE HALLMARK OF GOOD GOVERNMENT. IT INCLUDES: A RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS; DUE PROCESS; ACCOUNTABILITY; AND PUBLIC SECTOR VALUES. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO PROVIDING A SOLID INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION FOR PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD ALSO PRESERVE THEIR FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE. THIS INCLUDES: MAKING GOVERNMENT MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT; IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS ORGANIZATIONAL SILOS; BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF CITIZENS; IMPROVING GOVERNANCE PROCESSES; AND HARNESSING THE POWER OF MODERN INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. NOTWITHSTANDING CONCERTED EFFORTS TO BUILD GOVERNMENT CAPACITY TO ANTICIPATE, DETECT AND INTERVENE, UNPREDICTABLE EVENTS AND SHOCKS WILL OCCUR. GIVEN THIS, GOVERNMENT MUST ALSO FOCUS ON RESILIENCE BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY TO INNOVATE, LEARN AND ADAPT, AND BY ENSURING A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RISKS. IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO IMPROVE ANTICIPATIVE, INNOVATIVE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITIES WILL REQUIRE TARGETED INVESTMENTS FOR THE LONG TERM AND TOLERANCE OF SOME "EXCESS" CAPACITY. ULTIMATELY, THIS WILL REQUIRE RECOGNITION THAT LESS GOVERNMENT, AND MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT NECESSARILY AMOUNT TO BETTER GOVERNMENT.
405	THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT HAS EVOLVED FROM A RELATIVELY NARROW ECONOMIC TERM FOR DESCRIBING WORKFORCE TOWARDS A MORE COMPLEX MEANING. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IS A PRODUCT OF THE MANAGERIAL DOCTRINE THAT HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION VIA THE NEW PUBLIC MANAGEMENT. HRM ADVOCATES A NEW APPROACH TO THE PEOPLE IN AN ORGANISATION AND A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE EMPLOYEES AND ORGANISATIONS; DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE ADVOCATED BY THE TRADITIONAL, WEBERIAN ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL. THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT AND WIDER FROM THE OLD CONCEPT OF PERSONNEL-ORIENTED ADMINISTRATION. PERSONNEL-ORIENTED ADMINISTRATION IS CHARACTERISED BY PARTIALITY, RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM CHARACTER, STANDARDISED PROCEDURES, CENTRALISATION, AND RIGIDITY. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IS INTEGRAL, LONG-TERM AND STRATEGICALLY ORIENTED, INDIVIDUALISED, AND FLEXIBLE. ITS APPROACH IS DYNAMIC AND ACTIVE, AS WELL AS ORIENTED TOWARDS THE UPGRADING OF OVERALL ORGANISATIONAL EFFICIENCY. THE EU HAS SET THE STANDARDS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MODERN CIVIL SERVANTS' SYSTEMS IN POST SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. SOME OF THE BASIC STANDARDS ARE THE MERIT PRINCIPLE AND DEPOLITICISATION. HUNGARY, LITHUANIA, SLOVENIA, AND OTHER POST SOCIALIST COUNTRIES THAT JOINED THE EU IN 2004 HAD BEEN ADJUSTING THEIR LEGISLATION TO THOSE STANDARDS BEFORE THE ACCESSION. CROATIA SET OFF IN THE SAME DIRECTION BY PASSING THE LAW ON STATE CIVIL SERVANTS IN 2005. HOWEVER, THE LAW HAS NOT ACHIEVED THE INTENDED OBJECTIVES. IT HAS TOUCHED MANY ISSUES RATHER SUPERFICIALLY, BUT IT HAS NOT SET A REALISTIC FOUNDATION FOR A QUALITY, PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVANTS' SYSTEM. MOST NEW SOLUTIONS ARE UNFINISHED, THE EXISTING INSTITUTES HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND THE NEW INSTITUTES ARE NOT THERE TO REPLACE THEM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS STIPULATIONS THAT OPEN SPACE FOR FURTHER POLITICISATION OF THE SYSTEM. THE BASIC PROVISIONS THAT ARE THE CORE OF THE WHOLE CIVIL SERVANTS' SYSTEM - THOSE CONCERNING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, REMUNERATION SYSTEM, AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT SYSTEM - HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT. THEIR REGULATION HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE GOVERNMENT DECREES. MANY PROVISIONS CONTAIN THE ELEMENTS OF THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE CONGRUENT CONCEPT OF PERSONNEL-ORIENTED ADMINISTRATION. THE NEW APPROACH OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT MAY BE NOTICED IN THE PROVISIONS THAT DEAL WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE CENTRAL STATE OFFICE FOR ADMINISTRATION AND WITH ESTABLISHMENT OF ORGANISATIONAL UNITS IN CHARGE OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IN STATE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE GOVERNMENT DECREES, WHICH IS NOT SATISFYING SINCE IT ALLOWS POLITICAL INTERESTS TO MEDDLE INTO THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES THAT ARE USUALLY DECIDED AT THE LEVEL OF LAW AND NATIONAL STRATEGIES. INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE AND THE RUSH OF "MODERN" MANAGERIAL METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, WHOSE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT ALWAYS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, MERIT SYSTEM, AND THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, COULD BECOME DANGEROUS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.
406	A NATION'S RISE OR FALL HINGES, TO SOME EXTENT, UPON ITS NATIONAL GOVERNANCE QUOTIENT. NATIONAL GOVERNANCE QUOTIENT, OR NGQ, IS A QUANTITATIVE INDICATOR MEASURING THE GOVERNANCE LEVEL OF A COUNTRY IN QUOTIENT FORM. ITS VALUE IS THE RATIO OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND CAPACITY TO NATIONAL GOVERNANCE COSTS, AND ITS NATURE IS THAT OF AN AMALGAM OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE IDEAS AND TECHNIQUES QUANTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF THE FIGURES. IT IS ADVANCED BECAUSE ITS INNER CORE LIES IN LOGIC AND COMPUTATION, AND IT IS SCIENTIFIC BECAUSE IT IS GUARANTEED BY TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS SUCH AS BIG DATA AND CLOUD COMPUTING. THE FORMULATION OF NGQ PROVIDES TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND A BASIS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION FROM EXPERIENTIAL OR EXPERIMENTAL GOVERNANCE TO QUANTITATIVE, SCIENTIFIC GOVERNANCE, AND IT THUS HAS GREAT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND CAPACITY. AS WELL AS BEING USED TO PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE MODERNIZATION, NGQ CAN ALSO BE USED AS A MEASUREMENT STANDARD AND KEY SYMBOL FOR EVALUATING THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S NATIONAL GOVERNANCE BY 2020. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN BE USED TO COMPILE A WORLD NGQ REPORT WITH THE AIM OF TAKING HOLD OF INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE DISCOURSE, AS WELL AS TO COMPILE CHINA LOCAL NGQ REPORTS TO IMPROVE LOCAL GOVERNANCE IN CHINA.
407	THE COMMUNIST REGIME WAS TOTALITARIAN ALSO THROUGH ITS SO-CALLED REVOLUTIONARY PROJECT OF TRANSFORMATION AND COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OF SPACE. ESPECIALLY OF THE URBAN SPACE, THROUGH A GIGANTIC EFFORT OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 'MODERNIZATION' OF A COUNTRY LIKE ROMANIA WHOSE POPULATION, ECONOMY AND LIFESTYLE WERE TO A GREAT EXTENT RURAL. THIS MODERNIZATION THAT WANTED TO BE ORIGINAL WAS AS EQUIVOCAL AS INCOMPLETE. THE METAPHYSICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY PROJECT OF COMMUNIST MODERNIZATION OF URBAN SPACES FAILED THERE WHERE THE CAPITALIST MODERNITY SCORED ONE OF ITS MOST INCONTESTABLE VICTORIES: IN THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC SPACE AND IN THE SETTING UP OF A CLEAR THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. I WILL ARGUE THAT THE COMMUNIST REGIME'S SCORN BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC SPACE REPRESENTING THE CITIZENS' SPONTANEOUS CREATION AND PRACTICE AND FOR THE INVENTION OF PRIVATE SPACES AS EXPERIMENTAL ZONES OF NEW FORMS OF SUBJECTIVITY LEFT TRACES IN THE SOCIAL TISSUE: IF THE ARCHITECTURE DID NOT KNOW, DID NOT WANT, OR SIMPLY COULD NOT MATERIALIZE THE DEMAND FOR PUBLIC SPACES, THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR TURN, DID NOT KNOW, COULD NOT AND ABOVE ALL DID NOT WANT TO LEARN THE PRACTICES OF LIVING TOGETHER IN A CITY OR, IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE OF URBAN CIVILITY. AMONG OTHER CONSEQUENCES, THIS MAKES THE DISTINCTION PUBLIC/PRIVATE A TOOL VERY LITTLE USEFUL IN HELPING US UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNIST SPACE, AND EVEN LESS USEFUL IN NOTICING THE ESSENCE OF POST-COMMUNIST TRANSFORMATIONS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PRESENT DYNAMICS OF URBAN SPACES REMAINS LESS AND LESS LOYAL TO THE CONCEPTUAL TRADITION OF MODERNITY.
408	PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF ECONOMIC POLICY FAILURE IN GENERAL AND AGRICULTURAL POLICY FAILURES IN ALBANIA IN PARTICULAR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE VERY CONCEPT OF POLICY FAILURE IS A MATTER OF OUR INTEREST. TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL, WE HAVE CONDUCTED A BASIC LITERATURE REVIEW. THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF INTEREST IN THE STUDY IS THE INVESTIGATION OF TWO CASES WHERE AGRICULTURAL POLICY IN ALBANIA HAS FAILED. METHODOLOGY / APPROACH. TO CONDUCT THE STUDY WE USE SEVERAL METHODS: A REVIEW OF GENERAL LITERATURE IN RELATION TO GOVERNMENT POLICY FAILURE; REVIEW OF SPECIFIC LITERATURE REGARDING FARM SIZE AND COOPERATION; REVIEW OF NATIONAL POLICY OR STRATEGIC DOCUMENTS REGARDING AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL AND FARM SIZE AND COOPERATION IN PARTICULAR; REVIEW OF NATIONAL STATISTICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT FARM SIZE AND COOPERATION IN ALBANIA, AND DATA FROM INTERNATIONAL SOURCES SUCH AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. RESULTS. THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE WIDELY RECOGNIZED EVIDENCE THAT THE CONCEPT OF FAILURE IS MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND NOT UNIQUELY DEFINED. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO IDENTIFYING AND SUMMARIZING SOME OF THE MAIN CAUSES OF POLICY FAILURES. GOVERNMENT POLICIES GENERALLY FAIL WHEN INTERVENTION LEADS TO INEFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND AN OVERALL DECLINE IN PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WHEN THEY DO NOT INCREASE PRODUCTION, PRODUCTIVITY, OR REVENUE, OR WHEN SOCIETY DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE POLICY OBJECTIVES SET. POLICY FAILURES ARE GENERALLY RELATED TO THE WEAKNESS OF INSTITUTIONS. INSTITUTIONS ARE WEAK WHEN THEY FAIL TO PERFORM EFFECTIVELY THE THREE BASIC FUNCTIONS THAT ARE COMMITMENT, COORDINATION, AND COOPERATION. IN THE CASE OF AGRICULTURAL POLICIES IN ALBANIA, THE STUDY ANALYZES THE EXTREMELY LOW LEVEL OF COLLECTIVE ACTION AND THE SMALL SIZE OF FARMS, WHICH HAS REMAINED ALMOST THE SAME AND FRAGMENTED THROUGHOUT THE 30-YEAR PERIOD OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSITION. STRONG INSTITUTIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAFTING AND IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION AND DEVELOPING POLICIES, CHARACTERIZED BY THE PROFESSIONALISM AND HIGH PERFORMANCE OF THEIR STAFF, ARE THE ONLY GUARANTEE FOR ACHIEVING THE POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT AND ACCELERATING THE PROCESS OF ALBANIA'S INTEGRATION INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION. ORIGINALITY / SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE LITERATURE POINTS OUT THAT: (1) GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, (2) RULE OF LAW AND (3) WEAK CONTROL OF CORRUPTION ARE THE ROOT CAUSES OF ALL POLICY FAILURES, INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL POLICY FAILURES. WE ANALYZE THE DATA ON THESE INDICATORS FOR ALBANIA AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS REGION AND TRY TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THEIR IMPACT ON THE TWO POLICY FAILURES WE ARE INTERESTED IN, WHICH ARE THE SERIOUS LACK OF COLLECTIVE ACTION IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE SMALL SIZE OF FARMS IN ALBANIA. NO PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY FAILURES, AT LEAST IN ALBANIA. PRACTICAL VALUE / IMPLICATIONS. THE STUDY MAY BE USEFUL FOR THE DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF POLICIES, AND PERFORMANCE OF RELATED INSTITUTIONS IN ALBANIA. IT EMPHASIZES NOT ONLY THE NEED OF REFORMING THESE BODIES BUT ALSO SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN ALBANIA AND BEYOND.
409	THE LATEST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT CIVIL SOCIETY HAVE BEEN RECONSIDERING THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES, AND THE THEORETICAL DISCOURSE HAS BEEN BROADENED TO INCLUDE THE NOTION OF THE GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY. THE NOTION AND THE PRACTICE OF A CIVIL SOCIETY ARE BEING GLOBALIZED IN A WAY THAT REFLECTS THE EMPIRICAL PROCESSES OF INTER-CONNECTING SOCIETIES AND OF SHAPING A WORLD SOCIETY. FROM THE NORMATIVE-MOBILIZING PERSPECTIVE, CIVIL SOCIETY ACTIVISTS AND THEORETICIANS STRESS THE NEED TO DEFEND THE WORLD SOCIETY FROM THE GLOBAL THREAT OF A NUCLEAR WAR; ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHES, CRIME AND VIOLENCE. DOMINATION OF WORLD POWERS OVER THE FATE OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES AND SOCIETIES, I.E. THE NEED TO OPPOSE THE TENDENCY OF "POWER POLICY" ON THE WORLD LEVEL, AND TO DEFEND THE AUTONOMY OF THE (WORLD) SOCIETY AS ONE COMPATIBLE PRIMARILY WITH THE EXPANSION OF POLICIES BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW WORLDWIDE, AND INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE POLICY OF FORCE, STATE REASONS, AND DOMINATION OF WORLD POWER-CENTERS. THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES RESULT IN A CONFLICTING AND/OR ASSIMILATIVE CROSSING OF CIVILIZATIONS AND CULTURES, AS WELL AS CONTROVERSIAL TENDENCIES OF ON ONE HAND, ATTEMPTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 'PROTECTION, FOR THE DEFENSE OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES, FOR COMBATING TERRORISM AND SEGREGATION ON VARIOUS GROUNDS, THUS LEADING TO A GLOBAL STANDARDIZATION OF THE HUMAN-RIGHTS CULTURE AND OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AND LEGAL ORDER, AND ON THE OTHER, OF RISING XENOPHOBIA, PARTICULARIZATION AND ETHNO NATIONALISM, CIVIL WARS, ECOLOGICAL THREATS, GLOBAL TERRORISM, THREAT OF HUNGER PROBLEM, NUCLEAR WAR; NEW DISEASE, ETC. CONTEMPORARY VICTORY OF LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES IS THE POSITIVE REACH, BUT FOLLOWED BY THE CONTESTED ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY, URBAN DECAY, RACISM, ETHNIC CLEANSING, XENOPHOBIA, FAILING POLITICAL LEGITIMACY (IN THE WEST), AND FOLLOWED AT THE WORLD SCALE BY: GLOBAL INJUSTICE, POVERTY, ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS, MASS AND DEADLY DISEASES, OPPRESSION OF MINORITY GROUPS, RELENTLESS GROWTH OF POPULATION, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER GREAT ASYMMETRIES, TERRORISM OF THE GLOBAL SCALE, THREAT OF A NUCLEAR DISASTER ETC. GLOBAL CIVIL SOCIETY HAS THREE DIMENSIONS: 1) EMPIRICAL PHENOMENA OF GLOBALIZED SOCIAL RELATIONS, INTERCONNECTIONS, 2) MOBILIZING, FORMATIVE FORCE OF THE PROJECT/VISION, AND 3) SOCIAL ACTORS (MOVEMENTS) AT THE GLOBAL/TRANSNATIONAL LEVEL. THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT IS AN EFFORT TO COUNTER PERCEIVE NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION. ALTHOUGH ADHERENTS OF THE MOVEMENT OFTEN WORK IN CONCERT, THE MOVEMENT ITSELF IS HETEROGENEOUS AND INCLUDES DIVERSE, SOMETIMES OPPOSING, UNDERSTANDINGS OF THIS PROCESS, ALTERNATIVE VISIONS, STRATEGIES AND TACTICS. THUS, MORE NUANCED TERMS INCLUDE ANTI-CAPITALIST/ANTI-CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE GLOBALIZATION. PARTICIPANTS MAY USE THE POSITIVE TERMS SUCH AS 'GLOBAL JUSTICE' OR 'FAIR TRADE MOVEMENT'; OR 'GLOBAL JUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY MOVEMENT'; OR 'MOVEMENT OF MOVEMENTS'; OR SIMPLY 'THE MOVEMENT': OR 'ANTI-CORPORATIST CAPITALISM MOVEMENT'. GENERALLY SPEAKING, ANTI-GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT IS NOT SO MUCH AN OPPOSITION TO GLOBALIZATION AS SUCH THAN AN OPPOSITION TO THE PARTICULAR WAY IT IS TAKING PLACE - LIKE NEOLIBERAL PROCESS OF GLOBALIZATION. IN THAT SENSE, MANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MOVEMENT PREFER TO BE CALLED ALTERMONDIALISM.
410	IN THE PROCESS OF TEACHING LAW STUDENTS SOME SPECIAL ASPECTS OF TEACHING SEPARATE LEGAL DISCIPLINES ARE NOT ALWAYS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. TEACHING METHODS IN PEDAGOGY ARE DEFINED AS A WAY OF ACHIEVING A SPECIFIC GOAL; A SET OF WAYS FOR EXPEDIENT CARRYING OUT OF SOME WORK; A BRANCH OF PEDAGOGICAL SCIENCE WHICH EXPLORES REGULARITIES, RULES, TECHNIQUES AND METHODS OF TRAINING, IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. IN MODERN LEGAL LITERATURE ADVANCES IN APPLICATION OF METHODS FOR TEACHING FUTURE LAWYERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION IN EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES. THEREFORE, IN LAW, IT IS REASONABLE TO USE THE THEORY OF PAIRED LEGAL CONCEPTS. A LAW STUDENT SHOULD HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE ORIGINS, FORM, DEVELOPMENT AND TERMINATION OF USE OF A SEPARATE RULE OF LAW AND LAW IN GENERAL. SUCH LEGAL THINKING UNDERLIES THE THEORY OF PAIRED CONCEPTS AND THEIR VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LINKAGES. THE THEORY OF PAIRED CONCEPTS AND THEIR VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL LINKAGES IS THE CORNERSTONE OF SUCH LEGAL UNDERSTANDING. WHEN ORGANIZING INTERACTIVE SESSIONS IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CAREER GUIDANCE OF STUDENTS AND THEIR NUMBER. INTERACTIVE TECHNIQUES CAN BE INTRODUCED IN MAGISTRACY, THE CURRICULUM OF WHICH PLACES EMPHASIS ON PRACTICAL TRAINING IN SMALL GROUPS. THE TEACHING PROCESS SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON EDUCATING STUDENTS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN LEGISLATION, TO TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN FUTURE WORK. STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT LAW, THEIR LECTURERS EXPLAIN THEM THE FORM, CONTENT OF STANDARD REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY MISS POSSIBILITIES OF FORMATION OF A CORE OF THEIR LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS - THIS IS "GENUFLECTION" BEFORE THE LAW, ITS STEADY OBSERVANCE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A LAWYER TO PROMISE AND TO STEADILY OBSERVE THE STATE AND PERSONAL SECRET, TO BE LAW-ABIDING, TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF PERSONS WITH WHICH HE HAS TO COMMUNICATE NOT ONLY AT WORK (DUTY), BUT ALSO IN EVERYDAY LIFE. ALL THESE PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE IMBUED IN LAW STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR TRAINING IN UNIVERSITY AND IT IS APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE THEM IN ALL THE CURRICULA FOR EACH DISCIPLINE. BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. IT IS NECESSARY TO REVEAL THE LEVEL OF THE ACQUIRED LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN SOME FORMS. ONE OF THEM CAN BE A "LAWYER'S OATH" WHICH A GRADUATE SHOULD NOT READ BUT CONSCIOUSLY, SOLEMNLY AND PUBLICLY PRONOUNCE BEFORE A CORRESPONDING STATE EXAM, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THE THEORY OF LAW, OR BEFORE THE DEFENCE OF A GRADUATION WORK. UNFORTUNATELY, CONSIDERING THE JUDICIAL PRACTICE GIVEN IN THE PRESS, NOW IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAME A TYPE OF A CRIME, NOT TO MENTION MISCONDUCT, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE COMMITTED BY THE PERSONS WITH LEGAL EDUCATION. IN THE PROCESS OF CERTIFICATION, ACCREDITATION OF LEGAL UNIVERSITY THE AUDITORS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PRACTICE OF PROSECUTING ITS GRADUATES DURING A PARTICULAR PERIOD OF TIME, NOT TO MENTION THE OFFENCES COMMITTED BY STUDENTS EVEN DURING THEIR TRAINING PERIOD. IT MUST BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY OF MODEM LEGAL EDUCATION.
411	SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR UNITED NATIONS (UN) AUTHORISED PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS HAVE TENDED TO BE NOT ONLY MORE COMPLEX, BUT ALSO MUCH MORE INTERVENTIONIST AND MORE ROBUST THAN COULD EVER HAVE BEEN IMAGINED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF PEACEKEEPING. 1 HOWEVER, BECAUSE PEACEKEEPING IS NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE UN CHARTER, AND HAS DEVELOPED AD HOC IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING PERCEPTIONS AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS, IT IS OFTEN UNCLEAR WHAT LAWS ARE APPLICABLE TO PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS AND WHEN THOSE LAWS APPLY. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT LACK OF CLARITY, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON GAPS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LAW REGULATING THE CONDUCT OF PEACEKEEPERS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT APPROACH, WHEREBY PROSECUTION FOR CRIMES COMMITTED BY PEACEKEEPERS IS DEALT WITH PRIMARILY THROUGH THE DOMESTIC LAW OF THE TROOP CONTRIBUTING STATE, IS UNSATISFACTORY, AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN UNSATISFACTORY DESPITE EFFORTS TO PERSUADE CONTRIBUTING STATES' TO ESTABLISH THE LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORKS NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE AND PUNISH THEIR TROOPS FOR CRIMES COMMITTED OUTSIDE THEIR TERRITORIAL BORDERS. A CONVENTION BASED REGIME SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO ENSURING THAT PEACEKEEPERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO INTERNATIONALLY AGREED STANDARDS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF ENABLING THE UN TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE OF LAW STANDARDS IT ITSELF ESPOUSES. 2 SUCH A REGIME WOULD ENABLE THE UN TO RETAIN LEGITIMACY INTERNATIONALLY AND IN THE EYES OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE MISSIONS ARE DEPLOYED. IN ADDITION THE UN SHOULD EXPAND ITS OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT SERVICES TO ENCOMPASS A DEDICATED FULLY RESOURCED CRIMINAL JUSTICE UNIT. 3 ARGUABLY THE ACCOUNTABILITY GAP IN RELATION TO NON-MILITARY PERSONNEL IS EVEN GREATER THAN FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL SINCE, ALTHOUGH TROOPS GENERALLY HAVE COMPLETE IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION IN THE HOST STATE UNDER A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT, THEY ARE NORMALLY COVERED BY THEIR HOME STATE'S MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM; WHEREAS NON-MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE FUNCTIONAL IMMUNITY IN THE HOST STATE, UNDER THE CONVENTION ON THE PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 4 BUT MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR HOME STATE AT ALL WHILST THEY ARE DEPLOYED ABROAD. 5 HOWEVER NOT ALL TROOP CONTRIBUTING STATES HAVE INDEPENDENT CODES OF MILITARY JUSTICE OPERATING IN PEACETIME, AND IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT, RESPONSIBILITY FOR PUNISHING ANY WRONGDOING BY MILITARY PERSONNEL FALLS TO THE ORDINARY COURTS AND DISCIPLINARY BODIES. 6 IN ADDITION SOME COUNTRIES HAVE REMOVED SERIOUS CRIMES THAT VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS FROM THE JURISDICTION OF MILITARY COURTS. 7 BUT EVEN WHERE MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR HOME STATE'S MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND IT COVERS THE CRIME IN QUESTION, TROOP CONTRIBUTING STATES ARE OFTEN RELUCTANT TO PROSECUTE. 8 SINCE THE TRACK RECORD ON HOLDING UN TROOPS ACCOUNTABLE FOR CRIMES AND OTHER SERIOUS MISCONDUCT REMAINS POOR; AND SINCE THE MAJORITY OF ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMES AND MISCONDUCT REPORTED IN THE PRESS CONTINUES TO BE AGAINST SOLDIERS; AND SINCE SOLDIERS OUTNUMBER OTHER PERSONNEL IN UN OPERATIONS BY A WIDE MARGIN, 9 THIS PAPER FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR ON MILITARY PERSONNEL.
412	THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF STUDENT SOCIETIES (IN ESTONIAN "SELTS") WERE DISSATISFIED WITH INTERNAL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THE 1930S IN ESTONIA THAT PUT RESTRICTIONS ON DEMOCRACY. THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME THAT WAS BEING ESTABLISHED TRIED TO RESTORE BALANCE IN THE SOCIETY AMONG OTHER THINGS ALSO BY MEANS OF INCREASINGLY PROMOTING MEMBERS OF FRATERNITIES TO POSITIONS IN THE STRUCTURES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TARTU (UT). RESTRICTING THE AUTONOMY OF UT THAT STARTED IN THE AUTUMN OF 1936 SERVED AS A FINAL IMPETUS FOR LAUNCHING THE CULTURAL MAGAZINE AKADEEMIA (ACADEMY) IN 1937 AS THE ORGAN OF THE UNION OF ESTONIAN STUDENT SOCIETIES. ON THE PAGES OF THIS MAGAZINE AND IN THE PERIODICAL ARTICLE COLLECTIONS PUBLISHED BY STUDENT SOCIETIES A DISCUSSION WAS HELD ABOUT VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF "THE CRISIS OF THE ELITE". THAT DISCUSSION WENT ON UNTIL THE LIQUIDATION OF ESTONIA'S INDEPENDENCE. THE AUTHORS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY ALUMNI OF STUDENT SOCIETIES. THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE AUTHORS WAS NOT LARGE, BUT IT COMPRISED WELL-KNOWN AND RESPECTED PERSONS IN ESTONIAN SOCIETY: RESEARCHERS AND LECTURERS OF UT MAINLY FROM THE FIELDS OF NATIONAL SCIENCES, THE HUMANITIES AND LAW, PUBLIC PROSECUTORS, LONG-SERVING DIPLOMATS AND COMMENTATORS ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS. OFTENTIMES THE AUTHORS BELONGED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO SEVERAL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED CATEGORIES. SOME OF THEM ESPECIALLY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SENIOR GENERATION - HAD PARTICIPATED IN POLITICS IN THE ERA OF DEMOCRACY WHEN THEY HAD STOOD FOR LEFT-WING NATIONALISM WITH SOCIAL EMPHASIS. THE CULTURAL CRITICS WHO HAD BEEN EDUCATED ACADEMICALLY IN THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA WERE CONNECTED TO THE HUMANITIES IN UT AND THEY SUPPORTED THE HARMONY OF NATIONALISM AND DEMOCRACY. THEY WERE ALL UNITED BY THE IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, NATIONALISM AND SOCIAL ACTIVISM. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE DISCUSSION WERE IN MOST CASES MEMBERS OF THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS OF THE STUDENT SOCIETIES VELJESTO, EESTI ULIOPILASTE SELTS (ESTONIAN STUDENTS' SOCIETY), RAIMLA AND POHJALA. IN THE DEBATE HELD BY STUDENT SOCIETIES THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF THE CRITICAL NARRATIVE WERE THE ALIENATION OF INTELLECTUALS FROM THE PEOPLE AND THE CRISIS OF THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP. AS GENUINE DEMOCRACY WAS NOT RESTORED IN ESTONIA, THE SAID CRISIS CONTINUED - IN THE OPINION OF THE STUDENT SOCIETIES - UNTIL THE SUMMER OF 1940. ACCORDING TO MANY AUTHORS, AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF THE INTELLIGENTSIA'S PROBLEMS WAS STUDENT FRATERNITIES (IN ESTONIAN "KORPORATSIOON") WITH THEIR UNDEMOCRATIC SPIRIT. THEIR MEMBERS WERE ALLEGEDLY AT FIRST POLITICALLY PASSIVE, THEN INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT OF VABADUSSOJALASED (THE LEAGUE OF VETERANS OF THE ESTONIAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE) AND EVENTUALLY RENDERED SUPPORT TO THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. HOWEVER, THE STUDENT SOCIETIES CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DEFENDERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT. IN THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED AT THAT TIME, THE MAIN FOCUS STAYED GENERALLY ON FRATERNITIES, SORORITIES, STUDENT SOCIETIES AND THE INFLUENCES OF ONE'S STUDENT YEARS. THE OBJECTIVE WAS SET TO BE A FORMATION OF INTELLECTUALS WHO WOULD BE CLOSELY CONNECTED TO THE PEOPLE AND POLITICALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE.
413	FROM 1947 THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM (MTS), BASED ON THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT), WAS THE ENGINE FOR STABILITY, UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH, WELFARE AND PROSPERITY IN THE POST-WAR GLOBAL ORDER. THESE OBJECTIVES WERE SUSTAINED WITH THE COMING INTO FORCE OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), IN 1995, AS AS THE SUCCESSOR TO THE GATT. THE WTO INHERITED THE GATT ACQUIS, THE THE "CREDITS" FROM THE REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE GATT, BUT ALSO ITS CHALLENGES AND, IN A RADICALLY ALTERED GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, DEFINED BY THE 1991 COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA, SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN THE RELATIVE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE EMERGENCE OF MULTI-POLARITY. IN ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY, THE WTO HAS REGISTERED STRONG GAINS. ITS REGULAR WORK IS FUNCTIONING AT HIGH LEVELS OF TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN THE THE ADMINISTRATION OF ITS AGREEMENT. ITS DISPUTE SETTLEMENT FUNCTION IS HIGHLY REGARDED IN PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW. HISTORICALLY, THE ORGANIZATION IS EXPANDING ITS MEMBERSHIP, THROUGH MULTILATERAL ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS IN REGULAR WORK, THAT IS INTEGRATING DIVERSE ECONOMIES, PREVIOUSLY OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM, INTO THE RULES-BASED MTS, BASED ON A BALANCE OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE MARKET ECONOMY, THE RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE. IN ITS TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY, THE ROLE OF THE WTO IS INDISPENSABLE AND ITS FUNCTIONS ARE NON-SUBSTITUTABLE. IT CONTINUES TO UNIQUELY DELIVER THE GLOBAL PUBLIC GOOD OF NON-DISCRIMINATORY TRADE RULES. HOWEVER, THE WTO HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCLUDE THE DOHA ROUND ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS LAUNCHED IN 2001. THIS FAILURE IS SEEN AS HOBBLING ITS SYSTEMIC LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION AND FRAMING THE WIDER NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION. IT IS CONFRONTED BY THIS FAILURE, AND OTHER INHERITED AND RECENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE WEIGHING IT DOWN. SEVERAL OF THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BECOME MORE ACUTE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL ECONOMIES. MULTILATERAL TRADE RULES REQUIRE SYSTEM-WIDE REGULAR UPDATES TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THESE RAPID TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE ORGANIZATION IS IN LOCK STEP WITH COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC POLICY REALITIES. PROTECTIONISM IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN EVER, FUELLED BY THE INCREASED FREQUENCY OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISES. PUBLIC POLICY CONCERNS HAVE TO BE RECONCILED WITH TRADE LIBERALIZATION. PTAS ARE PROLIFERATING, DUE IN PART PART TO SLUGGISH MULTILATERAL RULE-MAKING. GEOPOLITICS IS RESURGENT WITH WITH RISKS FOR RULE-MAKING AND GROWTH. ALTHOUGH THE ROLE OF THE WTO REMAINS INDISPENSABLE, THE ORIGINAL MANDATES OF MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS DO NOT ESTABLISH THEM PERMANENTLY. AT PARTICULAR GENERATIONAL TURNS, DEFINED BY CRISES AND CHALLENGES, MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS MUST RE-DEFINE (OR REAFFIRM) AND RE-POSITION THEMSELVES TO ENSURE CONTEMPORANEITY, RETENTION OF POLE POSITION IN THEIR AREA OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION AND, EFFECTIVENESS. RESPONDING TO THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRES THE COURAGE OF STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP WITH THREE CRITICAL COMPONENTS: DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST AND ITS LESSONS; A PROSPECTUS FOR CHANGE; AND, A CAPACITY TO EFFECT SUCH CHANGE.
414	FOR TOO LONG, STATE INTERESTS HAVE DOMINATED PUBLIC JURISDICTION AND PRIVATE CHOICE OF LAW ANALYSES REGARDING THE REACH AND APPLICATION OF A STATE'S LAW, OR PRESCRIPTIVE JURISDICTION. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS-WHETHER OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS OR PRIVATE LITIGANTS-HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED. YET STATES ARE PROJECTING REGULATORY POWER OVER ACTORS ABROAD WITH UNPRECEDENTED FREQUENCY AND AGGRESSION. STATE INTEREST ANALYSES PROCEED FROM THE PERENNIALLY CRITIQUED BUT REMARKABLY STICKY CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY. NOW MORE THAN EVER, LEGAL THINKERS, COURTS, AND LITIGANTS NEED A BEDROCK CONCEPT FROM WHICH TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS ARGUMENTS AGAINST JURISDICTIONAL OVERREACH. AND IT SHOULD BE ONE THAT HOLDS NOT ONLY THEORETICAL COGENCY BUT ALSO THE PROMISE OF REAL-WORLD TRACTION IN CASES. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF SPATIAL LEGALITY. IT RECASTS THE FAMILIAR AND DEEPLY ROOTED NOTION OF LEGALITY-THAT IS, THE IDEA OF FAIR NOTICE OF THE LAW-ALONG SPATIAL AS WELL AS TEMPORAL DIMENSIONS. OPERATING IN TIME, LEGALITY VINDICATES INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, FOR EXAMPLE BY PROHIBITING EX POST FACTO LAWS. SPATIAL LEGALITY FOCUSES ON LAW'S REACH IN SPACE RATHER THAN ITS EXISTENCE IN TIME, BUT THE PROBLEM IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME: SOMEONE IS BEING SUBJECTED TO A LAW HE COULD NOT REASONABLY HAVE EXPECTED WOULD GOVERN HIS CONDUCT WHEN HE ENGAGED IN IT. THE ARTICLE BEGINS BY TAKING EXTANT RULES OF JURISDICTION IN MULTISTATE SYSTEMS AND TRANSFORMING THEM THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF SPATIAL LEGALITY INTO A RIGHT TO FAIR NOTICE OF THE LAW APPLICABLE AT THE TIME OF CONDUCT. IT THEN SHOWS HOW A JURISDICTIONAL MIX-UP METASTASIZING IN BOTH U. S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IS PRESENTLY AGGRAVATING SPATIAL LEGALITY PROBLEMS: NAMELY, THE USE OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER PARTIES TO BOOTSTRAP APPLICATION OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW TO THEIR EXTRATERRITORIAL CONDUCT. THE MIX-UP OCCURS (1) ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE, BY USING A DEFENDANT'S POSTCONDUCT PRESENCE IN THE FORUM TO JUSTIFY APPLYING SUBSTANTIVE LAW TO PRIOR CONDUCT OUTSIDE THE FORUM, AND (2) ON THE CIVIL SIDE, BY USING "GENERAL" PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER PARTIES TO JUSTIFY APPLYING FORUM LAW TO ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE FORUM. REORIENTING JURISDICTIONAL DOCTRINE AROUND THE RIGHTS OF PARTIES INSTEAD OF STATES GENERATES IMPORTANT DOCTRINAL AND LITIGATION PAYOFFS: IT CLARIFIES AND STRAIGHTENS OUT THE LAW FOR COURTS AND, WHERE COURTS DO ERR, SUPPLIES PARTIES WITH RIGHTS-BASED ARGUMENTS TO CHALLENGE SUCH ERRORS AS OPPOSED TO STATE-BASED ARGUMENTS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND COMITY. IN THIS CONNECTION, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A TYPOLOGY THAT WEAVES TOGETHER PUBLIC JURISDICTION AND PRIVATE CHOICE OF LAW DOCTRINES TO IDENTIFY HOW AND WHEN SPATIAL LEGALITY CLAIMS WILL HAVE THE MOST TRACTION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LAW. IT CONCLUDES BY INDICATING THE LIMITS OF A SPATIAL LEGALITY CONCEPT BASED ONLY ON NOTICE AND SUGGESTS OTHER RULE OF LAW CRITERIA LIKE FEASIBILITY OF COMPLIANCE, AVOIDANCE OF CONTRADICTORY LAWS, AND CONSISTENCY THAT, GOING FORWARD, MAY FURTHER INFORM ANALYSIS OF THE DEMANDS MULTISTATE SYSTEMS WITH OVERLAPPING LAWS PLACE ON FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS.
415	PURPOSESOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF EVERY NATION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK. CLIMATE RISK INDEX HAS DOCUMENTED SEVERAL CLIMATE CHANGE EVENTS WITH THEIR DEVASTATIONS IN TERMS OF LIVES LOST AND ECONOMIC COST. THIS STUDY AIMS TO LINK THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY WITH THE SOCIAL PROGRESS OF EXTREME CLIMATE AFFECTED COUNTRIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACHTHIS RESEARCH USED THE TOP 50 MOST CLIMATE-AFFECTED COUNTRIES OF THE DECADE AND ESTIMATED THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK ON SOCIAL PROGRESS WITH MODERATION EFFECTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY. SEVERAL COMPETING PANEL DATA MODELS SUCH AS QUANTILE REGRESSION, BOOTSTRAP QUANTILE REGRESSION AND FEASIBLE GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARE ARE USED TO GENERATE ROBUST ESTIMATES. FINDINGSTHE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT CLIMATE HAZARDS OBSTRUCT SOCIOECONOMIC PROGRESS, BUT RENEWABLE ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP TO MITIGATE THE REPERCUSSION. MOREOVER, IMPROVED INSTITUTIONS ENHANCE THE SOCIAL PROGRESS OF NATIONS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONSGOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPROVE THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAT ENHANCES THEIR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS, REGULATORY QUALITY, RULE OF LAW AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION TO INCREASE SOCIAL PROGRESS. IN ADDITION, SOCIETY SHOULD USE RENEWABLE ENERGY INSTEAD OF FOSSIL FUELS TO AVOID ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND HEALTH HAZARDS. INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SOCIAL PROGRESS AND LIVING STANDARDS, SO THERE SHOULD BE FREE HAND TO PRIVATE BUSINESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ENCOURAGING RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND UNIVERSITIES TO COME FORWARD FOR INNOVATION AND RESEARCH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONSTHE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ALL HUMAN STRUGGLE IS TO HAVE PROGRESS THAT FACILITATES HUMAN BEINGS TO UPLIFT THEIR LIVING STANDARD. ONE OF THE BEST MEASURES THAT CAN TELL US ABOUT A NATION'S PROGRESS IS SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX (SPI), AND ONE OF MANY FACTORS THAT CAN ABRUPTLY CHANGE IT IS THE CLIMATE; SO THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO LINK THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG THESE VARIABLES AND ALSO DISCUSS THE SITUATION WHERE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CAN BE REDUCED. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONSALTHOUGH SOCIAL PROGRESS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF TODAY'S ECONOMICS DISCUSSION, RELATIVELY FEW STUDIES ARE USING THE SPI TO MEASURE SOCIAL WELL-BEING. SIMILARLY, THERE IS CONSENSUS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE ON PEOPLE, GOVERNMENT AND CROPS BUT RELATIVELY LESS STUDY ABOUT ITS OVERALL IMPACT ON SOCIAL PROGRESS, SO THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO FILL THE GAP ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL PROGRESS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. ORIGINALITY/VALUETHE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY IS THE SOLUTION FOR THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK. CLIMATE RISK IS NOT IN HUMAN CONTROL, AND WE CANNOT ELIMINATE IT, BUT WE CAN REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. MODERATOR IMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DECREASES THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, SO THERE IS A NEED TO USE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY TO MITIGATE THE BAD CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE ON SOCIAL PROGRESS. ANOTHER MODERATOR IS TECHNOLOGY; USING TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CLIMATE, SO THERE IS A NEED TO FACILITATE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.
416	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES OF THE INTERCONNECTION AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF INNOVATION AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF TAX CONSULTING AND ON THIS BASIS TO DETERMINE THE AREAS AND TASKS OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT IN THIS SPHERE. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS INNOVATION AND INNOVATIVE TAX CONSULTING SERVICES. METHODOLOGY. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE USE OF GENERAL SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIAL-SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH ENABLED TO REVEAL THE CONTENT OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF TAX CONSULTING AS THE INTEGRITY OF ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AS A PRACTICAL LEGAL ACTIVITY BASED ON ENTERPRISE AND A STRUCTURAL UNIT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ITS FUNCTIONING AS AN INSTITUTION OF LEGAL ECONOMY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE METHOD OF FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS ENABLED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE AUTHOR'S APPROACH TO THE DEFINITION OF INFRASTRUCTURAL AND IMPUTED FUNCTIONS OF THE TAX-CONSULTING INSTITUTE, TO REVEAL THE CONTENT OF ITS INNOVATIVE FUNCTION, ITS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS. BASED ON A CATEGORICAL ANALYSIS OF INNOVATIONS IN THE LEGAL SPHERE, THE CONCEPT OF INNOVATIONS AND INNOVATIVE SERVICES OF TAX CONSULTING IS CONSIDERED TO REVEAL A COMBINATION OF LEGAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND INNOVATIVE CHARACTERISTICS IN ITS CONTENT. THE METHODOLOGY OF FACET CLASSIFICATION ENABLED TO DETERMINE AND CHARACTERIZE TYPES OF INNOVATIONS IN TAX CONSULTING, SUCH AS PRODUCT, PROCESS, MANAGEMENT-ORGANIZATIONAL, SOCIAL INNOVATIONS, AS WELL AS TO GROUND AREAS AND MEASURES OF MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY IN THIS SPHERE OF PRACTICAL LEGAL ACTIVITY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY REVEALED THAT THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY OF TAX CONSULTING AS A UNITY OF ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS ARE CLOSELY INTERCONNECTED WITH ITS INNOVATION, BECAUSE INNOVATIONS AS CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT, TECHNOLOGY, SERVICE PROVISION, CONSULTING, AND MARKET ACTIVITY ARE EFFICIENCY FACTOR, WHILE POSSIBILITIES OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION DEPEND ON THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IN LEGAL ASSISTANCE ON TAXATION AND THE QUALITY OF MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATION ACTIVITY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. IN THE RESEARCH, THE CLASSIFICATION OF TAX CONSULTING INNOVATIONS ENABLED TO REVEAL THE AREAS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT IN THIS PRACTICAL LEGAL ACTIVITY TO ENSURE ITS EFFICIENCY AS A TYPE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC INSTITUTE, CONSISTING OF UPDATING THE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BY DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING BUNDLED, BOUTIQUE SERVICES, DEVELOPMENT OF NICHE INDUSTRIES; TAX CONSULTING ON-LINE AND AUTOMATION OF TYPICAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; USE OF LEGAL CROWDSOURCING AND CROWDFUNDING; INTRODUCTION OF THE MODEL OF OPEN INNOVATION; MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIVE KNOWLEDGE; FORMATION OF EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TAX CONSULTING NETWORKS; PRO BONO SERVICES. RELEVANCE/ORIGINALITY. THE PROPOSED AUTHOR'S APPROACH TO THE DEFINITION OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND THE INNOVATIVE FUNCTION OF TAX CONSULTING, THEIR INTERCONNECTION AND INTERDEPENDENCE IS THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR, FIRST, STUDIES OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND LEGAL CONDITIONS AND FACTORS OF EFFECTIVE LEGAL ASSISTANCE ON TAXATION ON AN INNOVATIVE FOUNDATION, AND SECOND, DEVELOPMENT OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE INNOVATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF TAX CONSULTING, AND EFFECTIVE REALIZATION OF ITS FUNCTIONS.
417	PURPOSE THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE 10TH NATIONAL ELECTION HELD ON 5 JANUARY 2014, AND THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE DURING, BEFORE AND AFTER THE ELECTION IN BANGLADESH. VIOLENCE-FREE COMPETITIVE, FAIR AND CREDIBLE NATIONAL ELECTION IS A PRIORITIZED ISSUE IN THE POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE DISCOURSE IN BANGLADESH NOW. IN THIS PAPER, RELEVANT LITERATURE HAS BEEN REVIEWED FIRST FOR CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, THEN, THE PAPER INVESTIGATES TO EXPLORE THE CAUSES AND OUTCOMES OF VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE CENTERING THE 10TH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN BANGLADESH. FINALLY, IT PRESCRIBES POSSIBLE WAYS FORWARD TO OVERCOME THIS CRISIS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER IS DESCRIPTIVE AND QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND BASED ON SECONDARY SOURCES OF MATERIALS. AS IT FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND ISSUE RELATING TO THE ELECTORAL VIOLENCE OF A PARTICULAR NATIONAL ELECTION IN BANGLADESH, IT IS A CASE STUDY TOO. MOST OF THE INFORMATION AND DATA HAVE BEEN USED FROM PUBLISHED DOCUMENTS LIKE JOURNAL ARTICLES, BOOKS AND NEWSPAPER REPORTS. RELEVANT INFORMATION COLLECTED ALSO FROM ONLINE SOURCES. FINDINGS THE ELECTORAL VIOLENCE MAY HAPPEN FOR VARIOUS CAUSES, YET THE SIGNIFICANT CAUSE IS THE MOTIVE OF THE INCUMBENT FOR PICKING UP POWER OVER AND AGAIN. SIMILARLY, LACK OF COOPERATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES, NEGLIGENCE AND DOMINATION OF RULING PARTIES OVER OPPOSITION ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ELECTORAL AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE ELECTION. IN ADDITION, VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW AND, FINALLY, THE POOR GOVERNANCE OF BANGLADESH ARE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MEANINGFUL DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, STRONG POLITICAL WILL AND CONSENSUS AMONG ALL POLITICAL PARTIES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE MAIN LIMITATION OF THIS RESEARCH IS THE LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORTS TO COLLECT EMPIRICAL DATA FROM CONCERNED STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH FIELD VISIT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER DEALS WITH AN URGENT ISSUE OF BANGLADESH WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR A FREE, FAIR AND CREDIBLE ELECTION. TO MAKE THE EC AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE, A LAW SHOULD BE ENACTED FOR RECRUITMENT OF CHIEF ELECTION COMMISSIONER (CEC) AND OTHER COMMISSIONERS OF EC AS PER ARTICLE 118(1) OF BANGLADESH CONSTITUTION. TO FIND OUT NEUTRAL AND IMPARTIAL CEC AND OTHER MEMBERS OF EC, A SEARCH COMMITTEE IS VERY ESSENTIAL, AND FOR CONSTITUTING A SEARCH COMMITTEE, A LAW ALSO SHOULD BE ENACTED BY THE PARLIAMENT. THEREFORE, IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR ELECTORAL AND LEGAL REFORM TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF ELECTORAL VIOLENCE IN BANGLADESH. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THE FINDINGS OF THIS PAPER WILL BE ACCEPTED BY THE READERS, SCHOLARS AND POLICYMAKERS. A RADICAL CHANGE WILL COME TO THE POLITICS AND GOVERNANCE OF BANGLADESH. THUS, THE PAPER WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE SOCIETY AND COMMUNITY PEOPLE AS WELL AS CITIZENS OF BANGLADESH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR POLICYMAKERS TO REVAMP THE EXISTING DRAWBACK OF ELECTORAL POLICIES AND PRACTICE IN BANGLADESH. FOR A MEANINGFUL AND EFFECTIVE PARLIAMENT, IT WOULD BE NECESSARY. THE PAPER WOULD BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS OF THIS AREA TO USE AS REFERENCE. FINALLY, THE ACADEMICIANS AND READERS WILL FIND THEIR FOOD IN THE FIELD OF POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE.
418	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES INFLUENCING THE REASONABLENESS OF THE TERM OF PRE-TRIAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS LISTED BY THE RUSSIAN LEGISLATOR IN ART. 61 OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH THE SUBJECTS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS MUST DETERMINE WHETHER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE MET DURING THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OR NOT. THE RELEVANCE OF THIS ARTICLE IS DETERMINED BY THE FACT THAT THE TOOLS PROVIDED BY THE RUSSIAN LEGISLATOR TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLE TERM OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS ARE ALMOST COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE FOR USE FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. THE PROBLEM IDENTIFIED HAS BECOME THE MOST ACUTE IN VIEW OF THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION BY THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENTS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE BASIC STATISTICAL DATA ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE FOR 2014-2016. SO, WITHIN THE STAGE OF INITIATING A CRIMINAL CASE BY A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, PROCEDURAL DEADLINES BECAME THE RULE: IN 2015 - 8569516 DECISIONS WERE PASSED TO REFUSE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, OF WHICH 575204 DECISIONS WERE TAKEN 2 TIMES, AND 465140 - 3 AND MORE TIMES, AND OF THESE 8569516 DECISIONS TO REFUSE TO INITIATE CRIMINAL CASES 2346476 DECISIONS WERE AGAIN CANCELED, INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE ALREADY CANCELED 3 OR MORE TIMES (THEIR NUMBER WAS 366669). THE REFUSAL OF THE MODERN RUSSIAN LEGISLATOR TO COMPREHENSIVELY, COMPLETELY, OBJECTIVELY INVESTIGATE IN OPTIMAL TERMS ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIME COMMITTED ON THE BASIS OF THE CORRECT APPLICATION OF THE LAW (THE REQUIREMENT FORMULATED IN ART. 20 OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIALIST FEDERATIVE SOVIET REPUBLIC) LED TO THE NEED FOR A NORMATIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE TERMS OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. HOWEVER, AS THE THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE TESTIFIES, THE REQUIREMENTS OF ART. 61 OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ARE OF LITTLE USE FOR THE GOAL-SETTING AND SOLUTION OF THE TASKS OF MODERN CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN RUSSIA. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS PROBLEM IS THE ABSENCE OF DELIMITATION AND RANKING CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING A REASONABLE TIME AND FACTORS AFFECTING THE LENGTH OF TIME IN PARTS 3, 3.1, 3.3 OF ART. 6(1) OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH IN ITSELF EXCLUDES THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS RULE OF LAW. THE CURRENT SITUATION CALLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THE OBSERVANCE OF A REASONABLE PERIOD OF PRE-TRIAL CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. IN THE COURSE OF SCIENTIFIC WORK, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED NEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE TERM OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, PROVIDES DEFINITIONS OF THE CONCEPTS OF CRITERIA AND FACTORS FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD, REVEALS THEIR CONTENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE WORDING OF ART. 6(1) OF THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REVISED.
419	THE SUBJECT OF THE ARTICLE IS SOME JUDICIAL ACTS ON CASES CONCERNING PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ISSUED IN RUSSIA IN RECENT YEARS IN THE CONTEXT OF CHANGES IN THE PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION AND LEGISLATION ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE CURRENT RUSSIAN JUDICIAL DECISIONS MAY SERVE AS INPUT DATA FOR A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM IN FUTURE. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGES IN THE RUSSIAN PROCEDURAL LAW AND IN THE REGULATION OF THE NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN THE RECENT YEARS, WHICH FORM NEW TRENDS IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST CASES FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IN THE COURTS. THE AUTHOR MAKES AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF JUSTICE IN PROVIDING RECOURSE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY VIOLATIONS IN RUSSIA. IT IS DISCOVERED WHETHER THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED, FOLLOWING THE PROMISES OF THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE TRENDS IN JUDICIAL PRACTICE WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE AUTOMATION OF JUSTICE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NATIONWIDE DIGITALIZATION OF JUSTICE SUCH DIGITALIZATION REQUIRES SETTING GUIDELINES FOR THE AUTOMATED JUDICIAL DECISIONS FOLLOWED BY THE AUTOMATED DELIVERY OF JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS. THE METHODOLOGY COMBINES LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF JUDICIAL ACTS AND RUSSIAN LEGISLATION COMPARATIVE RESEARCH, FORESIGHT AND CRITICAL APPROACH BASED ON STRUCTURED ANALYSIS, INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS. THERE IS A SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCY IN PROTECTING PRIVATE PROPERTY IN RUSSIA, SINCE NEITHER THE RULES OF CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, NOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL TOOLS PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION ON THE MATTER. THE RECENT RELOCATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF RUSSIA FROM MOSCOW TO ST. PETERSBURG DID NOT PROMOTE THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE OF THE COURT. ON THE CONTRARY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THROUGH FORMAL EXCUSES REFRAINS FROM PROCESSING COMPLAINTS ON VIOLATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND ON THE INEFFICIENCY OF JUDICIAL PROCEDURES. THE RECENT MERGER OF THE SUPREME ARBITRATION COURT OF RUSSIA AND THE SUPREME COURT OF RUSSIA HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE UNIFORMITY OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE. IT VIOLATED THE RIGHTS THE OWNERS OF THE SHARED PREMISES IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS, BUT FAVORED THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WHICH BREACH THE OWNERS' RIGHTS. JUDICIAL ACTS STUDIED IN THIS ARTICLE PROVE THEIR INEFFECTIVENESS IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE QUALITY MACHINE LEARNING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REQUIRED FOR THE TRANSITION TO AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF BLUEPRINTS AND TEMPLATES OF COURT DECISIONS. ANALYSIS OF JUDICIAL ACTS ALLOWS TO CONCLUDE THAT THEY CANNOT SERVE NOW AS A BASIS FOR MACHINE LEARNING OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THEY CANNOT BE SYSTEMATIZED IN DATABASES EVEN BY THE CRITERION OF THE LAW NORMS APPLIED BY THE PLAINTIFFS, SINCE THE COURTS EVADE THE PROCEDURAL OBLIGATION TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY REJECT THE LAW NORMS THAT SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR A LAWSUIT OR COMPLAINT, AND APPLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ONES. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE STATE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FINDING EFFICIENT WAYS TO PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF JUSTICE, I.E. ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO COURTS, SINCE OTHERWISE THE DIGITIZATION OF JUSTICE WILL LEAD TO THE AUTOMATION OF ARBITRARINESS.
420	TO THE IDEAS OF BUILDING CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS IN RUSSIA RETURNED IN THE EARLY 90S OF THE XX CENTURY. THE RETURN TO THEM IS CONNECTED WITH CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF RUSSIA, WITH RECOGNITION OF THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. IT IS DURING THIS PERIOD THAT CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE REPLACED BY STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS IN THE WORKS OF THE POST-SOVIET PERIOD IS REDUCED IN FACT TO THE TERMINOLOGICAL REPLACEMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS WITH CONSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL RELATIONS. STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS AND CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS DIFFER IN THE FOLLOWING FEATURES: THE GOAL OF STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS IS REDUCED TO STATE CONSTRUCTION. THE PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS IS TO BUILD A STATE OF LAW. THE SUBJECT OF STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS IS THE RELATIONSHIP REGARDING THE ORGANIZATION OF STATE POWER, THE SUBJECT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS THE PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN-STATE INTERACTION. THE LEADING SUBJECT OF STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS IS THE STATE, THE SUBJECTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE EQUAL, WHILE THE LEADING ROLE OF THE PEOPLE (MAN) IS RECOGNIZED. STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS DETERMINE THE CONTENT OF PUBLIC LEGAL RELATIONS AND ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE-LEGAL RELATIONS. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS DEFINE THE MEANING OF ALL BRANCHES OF RUSSIAN LAW, FULFILLING THE LEADING ROLE. STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE PRESENCE OF MANY SPECIFIC LEGAL TIES DEEPLY PENETRATING INTO PUBLIC LAW RELATIONS, INCLUDING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE LARGELY GENERAL IN NATURE, DEFINING THE MEANING OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES WHILE NOT INTERFERING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTORAL LEGAL RELATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS HAVE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES: FIRST. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE AIMED AT ACHIEVING THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF THE RUSSIAN STATE, NAMELY, THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LEGAL STATE. THEY ARE INTENDED TO LIMIT PUBLIC WILL. SECOND. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF LEGAL RELATIONS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, PROVIDE ITS INTERNAL UNITY, HIERARCHY, AND FORM THE DIRECTIONS OF ITS DEVELOPMENT. THIRD. THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL OTHER TYPES OF LEGAL RELATIONS IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, INCLUDING STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS. FOURTH. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS, HAVING THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF GENERALIZATION, CAN FIND FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION IN ANY OTHER TYPES OF LEGAL RELATIONS, WHILE CREATING MULTILAYERED SYSTEMS OF LEGAL RELATIONS. FIFTH. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT OF THE LEGAL STATE. IN CONCLUSION, THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN: IN THE SCIENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, TWO TYPES OF LEGAL RELATIONS SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED BY CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS AND STATE-LEGAL RELATIONS. THE TYPE OF LEGAL RELATIONS IS DUE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE ROLE IN THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC RELATIONS. CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL RELATIONS ARE THE MOST GENERALIZED, FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL RELATIONS FORMING THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SYSTEM OF LEGAL RELATIONS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND ENSURING ITS INTERNAL UNITY AND HIERARCHY IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A LEGAL STATE.
421	PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE WAS NOT ALWAYS A PRINCIPLE OF CRIMINAL LAW. IN ANCIENT TIMES, AND EVEN IN MODERN TIMES, PRESUMPTION OF GUILT TOOK PRECEDENT OVER INNOCENCE. IN FACT, QUESTIONERS CONFIRMED HOW GUILT WAS THE DEFENDANT THROUGH BARBARIC TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE RACK, THE TEST OF FIRE, OR THROUGH BOILING WATER, WHICH WERE METHODS THAT FORCED THE DEFENDANT TO CONFESS ALL THE CRIMES OR OFFENSES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CHARGED. ALONG WITH THE PROGRESS OF RATIONALIST IDEAS, TORTURE LOSSES LEGITIMACY WHILE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE EMERGES AS A PRINCIPLE THAT UNDERLIES THE CRIMINAL PROCESS: ANY PERSON IS PRESUMED TO BE INNOCENT UNTIL THEIR GUILT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. ALONG WITH THIS ACHIEVEMENT, OTHER RIGHTS EMERGED: PROHIBITION OF TORTURE; THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND EXECUTION OF SENTENCES; THE RIGHT TO BE JUDGED BY A COMPETENT, INDEPENDENT, IMPARTIAL AND PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED JUDGE, AND THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF IRRETROACTIVITY OF LAW. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FRENCH REVOLUTION GATHERED THESE PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS IN THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITIZEN, AND THE NEWBORN DEMOCRACIES AND REPUBLICS WOULD COLLECT THEM IN THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL CANONS. LATER, THE MODERN CRIMINAL LAW EVENTUALLY INCORPORATED ALL THESE RIGHTS AS THE NEW PRINCIPLES OF THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. THE FIRST HALF OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BROUGHT NOT ONLY TWO WORLD WARS WITH THEIR LEGACY OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION, BUT ALSO THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM. THUS, THE UNITED NATIONS (UN), THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES (OAS), AND THE INTERAMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WERE BORN, AND THEIR DECLARATIONS AND CONVENTIONS ADDED DUE PROCESS, PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND OTHER GUARANTEES AS HUMAN RIGHTS. PARTICULARLY, THE SUCCESSIVE COLOMBIAN CONSTITUTIONS ADJUSTED THEIR SPIRIT TO THE NEWLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS, AND ALL THOSE PRINCIPLES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY INTEGRATED INTO THE COLOMBIAN CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CANONS. FINALLY, THE COLOMBIAN POLITICAL ORGANIZATION WAS REORGANIZED IN 1991 UNDER THE PARADIGM OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, AND THE NEW CONSTITUTION OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED ALL THE PRINCIPLES ATTACHED TO THE DUE PROCESS AS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE CONSTITUTION OF 1991 ALLOWED THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE NEW FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS INTO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, AND ALSO ESTABLISHED THE PILLARS OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF SEPARATION BETWEEN PROSECUTION AND INVESTIGATION. NEVERTHELESS, THIS MODEL REQUIRED A NEW CRIMINAL LAW BASED ON THE ADVERSARIAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO COLLECT AND EXTEND THOSE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES. THEREFORE, THE ARTICLE 250 OF THE CONSTITUTION WAS AMENDED, AND THE BILL FOR A NEW CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEM PASSED AND BECAME THE ACT 906 OF 2004. HENCE, THE ACT 906 OF 2004 NOT ONLY ORGANIZES THE NEW SYSTEM, BUT IT ALSO PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF ALL DEFENDANTS. PARTICULARLY, THIS ACT PROTECTS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AS A PART OF DUE PROCESS, AND IT WATCHES HOW DUE PROCESS ADJUSTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION. MOREOVER, IT ANALYZES THE CONTENT AND SCOPE OF DUE PROCESS, AND HOW IT MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS OF THE ACT 906 OF 2004.
422	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO MITIGATE DECADES OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE ERIE DOCTRINE'S PURPOSES, JUSTIFICATIONS, AND CONTENT. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT "ERIE" IS A MISLEADING LABEL ENCOMPASSING FOUR DISTINCT COMPONENTS. JUMBLING THESE COMPONENTS UNDER A SINGLE HEADING OBSCURES THEIR INDIVIDUAL NUANCES. ANALYZING EACH COMPONENT SEPARATELY HELPS TO CLARIFY QUESTIONS AND VALUES THAT SHOULD ANIMATE JUDICIAL ANALYSIS. THE ARTICLE THUS RECONCEPTUALIZES THE ERIE DOCTRINE, OFFERS A MORE PRECISE ACCOUNT OF HOW ERIE OPERATES, AND PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR RETHINKING SEVERAL FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF ERIE JURISPRUDENCE. 2013 MARKS ERIE'S SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY. THE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO ERIE AND ITS PROGENY. DECADES OF JURISPRUDENCE HAVE PRODUCED AS MUCH CONSTERNATION AS ENLIGHTENMENT. SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS AND LAWYERS HAVE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND AN EVER-EXPANDING CONSTELLATION OF OPAQUE PRECEDENTS. EVEN MENTIONING THE WORD "ERIE" CAN INVOKE FEELINGS OF DREAD. THAT REACTION IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT ERIE CONFRONTS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT AND ENDLESSLY FASCINATING. ERIE ADDRESSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS IN A FEDERAL SYSTEM, THE DIVISION OF POWERS WITHIN GOVERNMENTS, AND THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. SO HOW DID A DOCTRINE THIS CENTRAL TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER BECOME A MORASS OF OFTEN INSCRUTABLE DECISIONS? CONFUSION ARISES IN PART BECAUSE WHAT COURTS AND COMMENTATORS LABEL "THE ERIE DOCTRINE" COMPRISES FOUR DISTINCT SETS OF INQUIRIES SERVING FOUR DISTINCT FUNCTIONS. ERIE GOVERNS: (1) THE CREATION OF FEDERAL LAW; (2) THE INTERPRETATION OF ITS SCOPE; (3) THE PRIORITIZATION OF FEDERAL LAW RELATIVE TO STATE LAW; AND (4) THE ADOPTION OF NON-FEDERAL LAW WHEN FEDERAL LAW IS INAPPLICABLE. THESE FOUR INQUIRIES COLLECTIVELY HELP COURTS MAKE THREE KINDS OF DECISIONS WHEN ANALYZING CHOICE OF LAW. COURTS MUST DETERMINE: (1) WHICH GOVERNMENT IS AN AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE OF LAW FOR A PARTICULAR DISPUTE; (2) WHICH INSTITUTION WITHIN THAT GOVERNMENT IS AUTHORITATIVE; AND (3) WHICH RULE THAT INSTITUTION WOULD ENDORSE. BUNDLING THESE DISTINCT FUNCTIONS AND CHOICES INTO A SINGLE EXPANSIVE "ERIE" DOCTRINE SHROUDS DECISIONMAKING IN A HAZE OF GENERALITIES. FRAGMENTING ERIE INTO ITS COMPONENTS HIGHLIGHTS HOW DIFFERENT CONCERNS AND CRITERIA ARE RELEVANT IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, WHICH IN TURN CAN HELP RESOLVE A WIDE VARIETY OF THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS INTO SEVERAL RECURRING DOCTRINAL PUZZLES. FOR EXAMPLE, IT CONSIDERS HOW CHOICE OF LAW RULES IN FEDERAL COURT ARE A FORM OF FEDERAL COMMON LAW AND WHETHER KLAXON IS AN APPROPRIATE FEDERAL COMMON LAW RULE, WHICH TYPES OF STATE INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL DIVERSITY COURTS SHOULD EMULATE AND THUS WHETHER FEDERAL COURTS SHOULD ATTEMPT TO PREDICT THE DECISIONS OF A STATE'S HIGHEST COURT, THE EXTENT TO WHICH FEDERAL COURTS CAN CREATE COMMON LAW THAT INCORPORATES GENERAL LAW (INCLUDING CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW), WHAT DEFAULT RULES SHOULD GUIDE INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL LAWS THAT MIGHT CONFLICT WITH STATE LAWS, AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATUTORY AND COMMON LAW UNDER THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE AND HANNA'S "TWIN AIMS" TEST.
423	INTERNALISATION THEORY EXPLAINS HOW THE BOUNDARIES OF FIRMS ARE SET AT THE MARGIN WHERE THE ADVANTAGES OF INTERNAL COORDINATION ARE JUST OFFSET BY THE COSTS OF SUPPLANTING EXTERNAL MARKETS. INTERNALISATION IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT CAN BE USED TO EXPLAIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ANY INSTITUTION IN TERMS OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF COORDINATION. AS SUCH, IT APPLIES TO STATES AS WELL AS TO FIRMS. WITHIN THIS BROADER CONTEXT, MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES (MNES) HAVE AN ANALOGUE IN THE IMPERIAL STATE. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A NEW THEORY OF IMPERIALISM THAT IS ISOMORPHIC TO THE INTERNALISATION THEORY OF THE MNE. THIS THEORY PROVIDES A SET OF INSIGHTS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN ANY SYSTEMATIC WAY IN EARLIER THEORIES OF IMPERIALISM. 1. SOME STATES ARE MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL THAN OTHERS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE STRONG INCENTIVES FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION (E.G. PROMOTING FREEDOM, OF TRAVEL, ASSOCIATION AND EXPRESSION). 2. NEWLY DISCOVERED KNOWLEDGE IS A GLOBAL PUBLIC GOOD; IT IS THEREFORE EFFICIENT TO APPLY IT SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ALL TERRITORIES TO WHICH IT IS RELEVANT (E.G. APPLY THE SAME MINING TECHNOLOGY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT MINERAL-RICH COUNTRIES). 3. STATES HAVE A ROLE IN SUPPLYING LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS (E.G. LAW AND ORDER, TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND CERTAIN TYPES OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION); THEY CAN ALSO ESTABLISH PROPERTY RIGHTS AND REGULATIONS UNDER WHICH PRIVATE GOODS ARE PROVIDED BY A PRIVATE SECTOR. NEWLY DISCOVERED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW TO SUPPLY PUBLIC GOODS CAN THEREFORE BE EXPLOITED BY A STATE. 4. ALTHOUGH KNOWLEDGE IS A PUBLIC GOOD, THERE ARE OBSTACLES TO TRANSFERRING IT BETWEEN LOCATIONS. FOREIGNERS MAY NOT ACCEPT THE SUPERIORITY OF THE KNOWLEDGE; THEY MAY PASS IT ON TO THE SUPPLIER'S ENEMIES; OR THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ABSORB IT BECAUSE OF LIMITED EDUCATION. A STATE MAY THEREFORE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN EXPLOITING ITS KNOWLEDGE ABROAD THROUGH LICENSING AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED UNDER TREATY ARRANGEMENTS. 5. STATES POSSESS MILITARY KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS CIVILIAN KNOWLEDGE. THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAKER BETWEEN STATES THAN IT IS WITHIN STATES. SUPERIOR MILITARY KNOWLEDGE THEREFORE PERMITS A STATE TO TAKE OVER OTHER TERRITORIES BY FORCE. A KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE STATE FRUSTRATED BY BARRIERS TO KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER MAY THEREFORE RESORT TO FORCE AND TAKE OVER (OCCUPY OR GOVERN) TERRITORIES CONTROLLED BY OTHER STATES (ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT REFUSE TO RECOGNISE ITS SUPREMACY). 6. KNOWLEDGE OBSOLESCES, AND AS IT DOES SO THE STRATEGIC CASE FOR IMPERIALISM DECLINES. THESE INSIGHTS SUGGEST THAT IMPERIALISM IS A RATIONAL RESPONSE TO A SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY SUGGEST THAT IN A WORLD WHERE OPPORTUNITIES TO DISCOVER NEW KNOWLEDGE ARISE CONTINUOUSLY, IMPERIALISM EMERGES NATURALLY WHEREVER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAIL. OBSOLESCENCE TOO IS A NATURAL PROCESS, AND THIS EXPLAINS WHY EMPIRES DECLINE. THE DECLINE OF ONE EMPIRE MAY GENERATE A GAP THAT SOME OTHER RISING EMPIRE MAY BE ABLE TO FILL. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY REVIEWING A PANEL OF FOURTEEN EMPIRES ON WHICH THE THEORY CAN BE TESTED USING CASE STUDY ANALYSIS. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
424	THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE DICTATES THAT UNDULY VAGUE PENAL STATUTES WILL BE CONSIDERED VOID BASED ON DUE PROCESS PRINCIPLES. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT HAS GROUNDED THE DOCTRINE IN TWO RATIONALES. FIRST, VAGUE PENAL STATUTES FAIL TO INFORM THE ORDINARY PERSON OF WHAT IS PROSCRIBED, THEREBY VIOLATING AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF DUE PROCESS: THE REQUIREMENT OF FAIR NOTICE. SECOND, VAGUE PENAL STATUTES VIOLATE SEPARATION-OF-POWERS AND RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES INHERENT IN DUE PROCESS BY DELEGATING LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO OTHER ACTORS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM: POLICE, PROSECUTORS, JUDGES, AND JURIES. THE CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY OF THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE HAS BEEN RECENTLY CALLED INTO QUESTION BY JUSTICE THOMAS, WHO HAS SUGGESTED THAT THE DOCTRINE HAS LITTLE CONNECTION TO CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT OR HISTORY AND IS AKIN TO THE MUCH MALIGNED DOCTRINE OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS. THE DOCTRINE ALSO SUFFERS FROM A NUMBER OF OTHER DEFECTS. FIRST, THE SUPREME COURT, IN OVER A CENTURY OF ADDRESSING VAGUENESS CHALLENGES, HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE AN INTELLIGIBLE STANDARD FOR IDENTIFYING UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE STATUTES. IN ADDITION, IT APPEARS ARBITRARY TO DEEM VAGUE LAWS UNCONSTITUTIONAL WHEN NONVAGUE STATUTES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO AMBIGUOUS ONES, CAN ALSO FAIL TO PROVIDE NOTICE FOR POTENTIAL WRONGDOERS AND CAN DELEGATE EXCESSIVE LEGISLATIVE POWER TO COURTS AND PROSECUTORS. FURTHERMORE, THE COURT'S JURISPRUDENCE EMBRACES AN INHERENT CONTRADICTION: IT PERMITS COURTS AND EXECUTIVE AGENCIES TO SAVE OTHERWISE VAGUE STATUTES THROUGH LIMITING CONSTRUCTIONS, EVEN THOUGH EXCESSIVE DELEGATION TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS IS ONE OF THE PURPORTED EVILS OF VAGUE STATUTES. FINALLY, THE COURT HAS HELD THAT A SCIENTER REQUIREMENT FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY CAN ALSO SAVE AN OTHERWISE VAGUE STATUTE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SCIENTER TYPICALLY REFERS TO KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS THAT MAKE ONE'S CONDUCT ILLEGAL, NOT KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE'S CONDUCT FALLS WITHIN THE LAW'S PROSCRIPTION. BOTH CLARITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY CAN BE INFUSED INTO THIS AREA BY SHEDDING THE RHETORIC OF VAGUENESS AND INSTEAD THINKING OF THE PROBLEM AS IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPLIANCE. WHERE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES, IT IS SOMETIMES, THOUGH NOT ALWAYS, IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY. AND A BASIC ELEMENT OF DUE PROCESS RECOGNIZED BY LORD EDWARD COKE IN DR. BONHAM'S CASE OVER FOUR CENTURIES AGO IS THAT THE LAW CANNOT COMPEL THE IMPOSSIBLE. A CLOSE LOOK AT THE STATUTES THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DECLARED TO BE VAGUE OVER THE PAST CENTURY REVEALS THAT THEY GENERALLY SHARE ONE OF TWO DEFECTS: THEY REQUIRE AN ACTOR TO CONFORM HIS CONDUCT EITHER TO UNKNOWABLE OBJECTIVE FACTS OR TO UNASCERTAINABLE NORMATIVE STANDARDS. SUCH STATUTES VIOLATE LORD COKE'S ANCIENT DICTUM BY REQUIRING THAT PERSONS PERFORM THE IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WAY OF REFRAMING VAGUENESS AS IMPOSSIBILITY NOT ONLY PROVIDES A FIRMER CONSTITUTIONAL FOOTING FOR SOME OF THE COURT'S PRECEDENTS BUT ALSO PROVIDES A GUIDE FOR FUTURE CASES. WHILE CLOSE CASES WILL STILL ARISE, RECASTING VAGUENESS AS IMPOSSIBILITY IN MANY CASES WILL HELP BOTH LITIGANTS AND COURTS BY REFRAMING THE QUESTION AS WHETHER THE STATUTE AT ISSUE ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES THAT THE ACTOR PERFORM THE IMPOSSIBLE.
425	THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IS AMONG THOSE RULES GOVERNING PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE STATE WHICH ACCOMPANY THE REFLECTION ABOUT THE EXERCISE OF STATE AUTHORITY SINCE IT HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE ATTRIBUTES OF A GOVERNMENT THE PEOPLE DESERVE. THIS QUESTION ATTRACTS INTEREST OF CONSTITUTIONALISM SINCE ITS BIRTH. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT OF MANY CRITICAL ASSESSMENTS AND COMMENTS FOCUSED ON THE PRACTICE OF FUNCTIONING OF CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS BASED ON THAT PRINCIPLE. HOWEVER, THEIR FUNCTIONING IS NOT FREE OF MISTAKES AND FAILURES; AND THE PRINCIPLE ITSELF HELPS THE GOVERNMENTS JUSTIFY THEIR LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS AND DISCOURAGES THE ORDINARY CITIZENS FROM PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE. IT IS ALSO PERCEIVED AS AN ANACHRONISM, AS COMPARED TO THE OPPORTUNITIES OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IT MIGHT BE SAID, HOWEVER, THAT THIS PRINCIPLE, TYPICAL OF DEMOCRATIC STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTES-ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THREATS TO MODERN DEMOCRACY-A DETERMINANT OF IDENTITY OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, ON ACCOUNT OF ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE AFFIRMATION AND GUARANTEES OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS ROLE IN SHAPING THE STRUCTURE AND RULES OF FUNCTIONING OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE. THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE IS ARTICULATED IN ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONSTITUTION AND IN THE STATE STRUCTURES ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND MECHANISMS PROVIDED FOR THEIR FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES DETERMINING THE LIMITS OF AUTHORITY. SPECIFYING THE DEFINITION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL STRESSED THAT SUCH SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE LACK OF THE SUPREME ORGAN OF THE STATE AUTHORITY, WHILE THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPREMACY OF CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A FOUNDATION OF THE STATE. IN THE OPINION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE MEANS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES OF POWER ARE SEPARATED, AND THAT THERE MUST BE BALANCE AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THEM. HOWEVER, THIS PRINCIPLE HAS NO MERELY ORGANIZATIONAL NATURE, SINCE IT IS AIMED AT PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY PREVENTING ANY BRANCH OF POWER FROM THE ABUSE OF ITS AUTHORITY. THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE TRIBUNAL GIVES US AWARENESS THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY CONSIST IN THE LIMITATION OF POWER OF THE MAJORITY BY THE RIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL. OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SEPARATION OF POWERS IN A DEMOCRATIC STATE, IS THE ISSUE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE POWERS. THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BY THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN RELATION TO THESE RELATIONS, IS CALLED BY THE DOCTRINE "RATIONALIZED PARLIAMENTARISM. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE ROLE GIVEN TO STATUTE BY THE AUTHORS OF THE CONSTITUTION TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IT SEEMS THAT THEY EVEN RELY ON STATUTE AND JUDICIAL POWER, RATHER THAN ON THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PRINCIPLE FOR PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST POSSIBLE THREATS, PARTICULARLY FROM THE EXECUTIVE POWER.
426	THIS ARTICLE INQUIRES INTO THE ORGANISATION POUR L'HARMONISATION DU DROIT DES AFFAIRES EN AFRIQUE (OHADA)'S CLAIMS TO INNOVATION FOR ITS LAW REFORM PROCESSES AND INTO ITS AMBITION TO BECOME A PRECEDENT FOR PURSUING LEGAL INTEGRATION AMONG COUNTRIES ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA AND IN THE WORLD. IT SEEKS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE OHADA REGIME EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTES TO, OR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO, SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN MEMBER STATES. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT, THE ARTICLE REVISITS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PART THAT INTERNATIONAL AND WESTERN INSPIRED LAW SHOULD PLAY IN DEVELOPMENT, INSTITUTIONAL RENOVATION AND LAW REFORM IN OHADA COUNTRIES. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SHIFT OF PARADIGMS SHOULD OCCUR IN OHADA AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW FROM THE FOREIGN INVESTOR CREDO TOWARDS A MORE NUANCED EMPIRICALLY INFORMED APPROACH TO LAW MAKING. LEGAL, POLICY AND ECONOMIC EXPERTS SHOULD CONCENTRATE MORE EFFORTS ON THE NEEDS, PRACTICES AND REALITIES OF BUSINESSES IN OHADA STATES, PARTICULARLY LOCAL ENTERPRISES THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM (MSM) AND ARE REGULATED BY BOTH FORMAL AND UNOFFICIAL RULES. FOCUSING ON FACILITATING THE OPERATION OF LOCAL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS ON POVERTY REDUCTION RATHER THAN ON MAKING REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, THE DOMINANT GOAL OF BUSINESS LAW REFORM IN THE OHADA CAN LEAD TO COMMERCIAL RULES AND STRATEGIES MORE SUCCESSFUL AT FOSTERING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN MEMBER PARTIES. BEARING THIS IN MIND, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS ASCRIBED TO THE OHADA REGIME WITH A VIEW TO INVESTIGATING WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE USEFULLY TO THE OPERATION OF BUSINESSES AND MORE GENERALLY TO SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN MEMBER STATES. THE ATTRIBUTES EXAMINED CONCERN BOTH THE FORM AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NEW LAW. PART A LOOKS AT THE ALLEGED INCREASED PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY AND LOGICAL ORDERING OF MEMBER STATES' BUSINESS LAW RULES. IN ORDER TO BETTER APPRECIATE THE IMPACT OF THIS CLAIMED NOVELTY, PART B FOCUSES ON THE OHADA ACTS THEMSELVES AND ANALYSES THREE OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS, NAMELY THEIR SUPRANATIONAL, TRANSPLANTED AND VIRAL-LIKE NATURE, THE LATTER TWO QUALIFIERS BEING USED METAPHORICALLY. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT WHILE OHADA-PROMOTED RULES AND CONCEPTS ARE INNOVATIVE IN A NUMBER OF RESPECTS, THEIR SUPRANATIONAL, TRANSPLANTED AND VIRAL QUALITIES HAVE EITHER LITTLE, NONE OR ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE OPERATION OF LOCAL MSM BUSINESSES IN THE OHADA REGION. SOME COMMENTATORS CONTEND THAT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND POOR EFFECTIVENESS OF LAWS CAN BE LINKED TO A SYSTEM'S LEGAL ORIGINS. IN PARTICULAR, LAW AND ECONOMICS SCHOLARS AND OTHER ACADEMICS HAVE ASSERTED THAT COMMON LAW IS A SUPERIOR NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK TO CIVIL LAW FOR LAW REFORM AIMED AT PROMOTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE "RULE OF LAW". PART C CONSIDERS THIS CLAIM AND ARGUES THAT THE DEBATE IS BESIDE THE POINT SINCE IT PRESUPPOSES A HERMETIC CONCEPTION OF LEGAL TRADITIONS, CONCEIVES DEVELOPMENT AS BEING PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND DOES NOT REST ON SOLID EMPIRICAL DATA FROM OHADA STATES.
427	THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, IN WHICH MOST OF EUROPEAN AND THE WORLD COUNTRIES TODAY ARE, IS IN NEED OF RENEWAL AND CONTINUITY OF INTEGRATION PROCESSES IN VITAL AREAS TO WHICH THE ECONOMIC SPHERE ITSELF BELONGS. ENSURING THE INTRODUCTION OF UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS FOR THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE ECONOMY INTO THE PRACTICE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ACTORS IS TODAY A PRIORITY TASK OF ABSOLUTELY ALL COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DECLARED IN THEIR BASIC LAW THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE BY LAW, THE RECOGNITION OF A PERSON, ITS LIFE AND HEALTH AS THE HIGHEST VALUE. SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES TO THE GRADUAL AND SYSTEMATIC NATURE OF SUCH ACTIVITIES, DETERMINED BY THE AGGRAVATION OF SOCIAL TENSION IN SOCIETY, EXTERNAL AGGRESSION, THE PECULIARITIES OF DOMESTIC DOCTRINE AND LEGISLATION, WHICH ARE FORMED USING WELL-DEFINED CONCEPTS, AT THE SAME TIME, TODAY CONTAIN AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS ON CONTENT, IN PARTICULAR, THE NOTION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, THEIR VARIETIES, PROCEDURES FOR THEIR PROVISION, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. THE ABOVEMENTIONED CAUSES THE NECESSITY TO SEARCH FOR THE BEST WAYS TO ELIMINATE THE ABOVE INCONSISTENCIES, WHICH LEAD TO REAL INHIBITION OF ACTIVITIES AS TO ENSURE THE QUALITY PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. ONLY THE CAUTIOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, AS IMPLEMENTED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES (GREAT BRITAIN, GERMANY, THE USA, FRANCE, HUNGARY, THE BALTIC STATES ETC.), SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PECULIARITIES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN A SPECIFIC STATE, IN PARTICULAR, IN UKRAINE ONE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT CRISIS IN THE POLITICAL AND INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND, FIRST OF ALL, THE URGENT NEED FOR SERVICE ORIENTATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE ECONOMY AND THE FINANCIAL SPHERE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH FEATURES SHOULD NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PRINCIPLE OF GRADUALNESS AND THE CONTINUITY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN THIS AREA. METHODOLOGY. THE SOLUTION OF THE SET PURPOSE IS REALIZED USING THE COGNITIVE POTENTIAL OF THE SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHICAL, GENERAL SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIAL METHODS. THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD IS DOMINANT, WHICH ALLOWED DETERMINING THE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIONS OF DOMESTIC STATUTORY ENACTMENTS IN ORDER TO BRING THEM IN LINE WITH THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED STANDARDS FOR THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, THE EXPERIENCE OF HIGHLY DEVELOPED ECONOMIES. METHODS OF GRAMMATICAL REVIEW AND INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IDENTIFYING GAPS AND OTHER SHORTCOMINGS IN LEGISLATION THAT REGULATES THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE ECONOMY, DEVELOPING PROPOSALS FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE INTRODUCTION OF EFFECTIVE, TIMELY, AND CONSECUTIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF QUALITY PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE ECONOMY, BASED ON THE UNIFICATION OF THE STANDARDS OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, WHICH WILL MEAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS RECOVERY. MOREOVER, AN EXAMPLE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE FUNCTIONS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL DEMONSTRATE REAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF AN IMPORTANT TASK OF REFORMATION IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS DEVELOPED DEMOCRACY AND INSUFFICIENTLY HIGH INVESTMENT CLIMATE INDEX.
428	PURPOSE - FOR MORE THAN FOUR DECADES, PERSISTENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND A FOCUSED GROWTH STRATEGY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURAL AND OTHER FAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES IN THE WORLD'S DEVELOPING NATIONS. HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH IS NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF SOUND ECONOMIC POLICIES BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTING A BROAD RANGE OF SOCIAL POLICIES. THE BRICS (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND SOUTH AFRICA) NATIONS HAVE PROVEN THEIR TESTIMONY ON BOTH THESE FACTORS. FOLLOWING THEIR PATH ARE SOME OTHER EMERGING ECONOMIES LIKE N-11 (OR NEXT ELEVEN PROPOUNDED BY GOLDMAN SACHS (2005) REPORT), WHICH THIS PRESENT STUDY TRIES TO EXAMINE AS SUCCESSORS OF BRICS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - ALONG WITH PANEL DATA REGRESSION MODELLING, THE STUDY HAS APPLIED ECONOMETRIC PROCEDURES ROBUST TO HETEROGENEITIES ACROSS VARIOUS NATIONS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE RELIABLE RESULTS THAT CAN BE GENERALIZED FOR OTHER SIMILAR GROUPS OF COUNTRIES. 11 INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (BOTH ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL) HAVE BEEN USED TO MEET THE STUDY'S OBJECTIVE FOR A PERIOD OF 34 YEARS (1985-2018). FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY REVEAL THAT THE GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH THE GROUP OF COUNTRIES MUST WORK TOWARD THEIR MACRO-ECONOMIC STABILITY FACTORS (EXTERNAL DEBT STOCKS), TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES (MOBILE AND FIXED BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS), HUMAN CAPITAL (HEALTH EXPENDITURE) AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS (MAINLY THE RULE OF LAW) TO ENHANCE THEIR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THIS STUDY ENHANCES KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN EMERGING COUNTRIES. FIRMS FROM BRICS AND N-11 MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THEIR INTERNATIONALIZATION PROCESS (BOTH ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL). THE STUDY IS SIGNIFICANT NOT JUST FOR THE RESEARCHERS BUT ALSO FOR THE POLICYMAKERS OF THE BRICS AND N-11 TO UNDERSTAND IN WHICH AREAS THEIR COUNTRY IS LEADING OR LAGGING. THE STUDY IS USEFUL EVEN FOR THE POLICYMAKERS OF OTHER EMERGING COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD WHO MIGHT TAKE LESSONS FROM THESE NATIONS (ESPECIALLY BRICS) AND FOLLOW THEIR SUCCESS PATH. THIS STUDY HELPS THE GOVERNMENTS OF OTHER GROUPS OF EMERGING COUNTRIES SUCH AS PIN (PAKISTAN, INDONESIA AND NIGERIA); MINT (MEXICO, INDONESIA, NIGERIA AND TURKEY); CIVETS (COLOMBIA, INDONESIA, VIETNAM, EGYPT, TURKEY AND SOUTH AFRICA), ETC. WHICH CAN FOLLOW THE PATH OF BRICS ECONOMIES IN GROWTH AND FORMULATE POLICIES TO INCREASE THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH ACCORDINGLY. AT THE ENTERPRISE LEVEL, IT HELPS MNCS UNDERSTAND BRICS AND N-11 MARKETS AND FORMULATING ENTRY AND GROWTH STRATEGIES IN THESE MOST EMERGING COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE PRESENT STUDY IS UNIQUE. IT TRIES TO INVESTIGATE THE PROJECTIONS OF THE GOLDMAN SACHS REPORT AFTER 15 YEARS OF ITS RELEASE. IT TRIES TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE N-11 COUNTRIES WITH ADVANCED ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES. MAJORLY, THE FOCUS IS TO COMPARATIVELY ANALYZE THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY FOR BRICS AND N-11 NATIONS AND SUGGEST WHETHER N-11 HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME SUCCESSORS OF BRICS. A CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO EXAMINE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS (BOTH ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL), WHICH MAY LEAD TO ECONOMIC PROGRESSION, HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS STUDY.
429	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CONSIDER THE RISKS OF CORRUPTION AND METHODS FOR THEIR ASSESSMENT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO COUNTER THE CORRUPT BEHAVIOR OF EMPLOYEES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BASED ON THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: THE STUDY OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS, ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS OF SPECIAL LITERATURE AND STATISTICAL DATA. THE AUTHORS BELIEVE THAT THE BASIS OF CORRUPTION LIES IN THE ECONOMY, BUT IT IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. CORRUPTION IS THE ENTRY INTO AN UNLAWFUL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER, THE EMPLOYEE AND THE GOVERNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, RESEARCHERS ARGUE THAT IT IS CORRUPTION RISK THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF CORRUPTION-RELATED OFFENSES. CORRUPTION RISK MEANS THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A CORRUPTION PLAN. IDENTIFICATION AND PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION RISKS, ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, IS BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF LEGAL, ORGANIZATIONAL AND PREVENTIVE METHODS. THE LEGAL REGULATION OF ANTI-CORRUPTION ACTIVITIES IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS REFLECTED IN REGULATORY DOCUMENTS. IN COUNTERING CORRUPTION, THE TIMELY IDENTIFICATION OF CORRUPTION RISKS HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO FIVE CRITERIA: BY OBJECT, BY TYPE, BY REASON OF OCCURRENCE, BY SCALE OF COVERAGE, BY THE SIZE OF FINANCIAL THEFT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. EACH FEATURE REQUIRES A SPECIAL IN-DEPTH STUDY. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE RISKS OF CORRUPTION IN THE FIELD OF SOCIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS. AMONG CORRUPTION VIOLATIONS, A SPECIAL PLACE IS OCCUPIED BY PERSONNEL CORRUPTION. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF VIOLATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WORK. CORRUPTION RISKS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES FOR A VACANT POSITION, APPOINTING AN EMPLOYEE TO A MANAGEMENT POSITION, AND ILLEGAL MANAGERIAL ACTIVITIES OF A MANAGER. IN ORDER TO COUNTER CORRUPTION IN AN ORGANIZATION, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF CORRUPTION RISKS. IT ALLOWS TO ENSURE THE COMPLIANCE OF ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES WITH THE SPECIFICS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN METHODS FOR ASSESSING CORRUPTION RISKS ARE STATISTICAL AND EXPERT ASSESSMENT METHODS. ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, TO COMBAT CORRUPTION IN THE FIELD OF LABOR RELATIONS, AN EFFECTIVE FORM IS THE SYSTEM OF PERSONNEL MOTIVATION. TO PREVENT CORRUPTION AND MINIMIZE CORRUPTION RISKS, THE FOLLOWING PREVENTIVE MEASURES ARE PROPOSED: (1) EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF FACTS AND FORMS OF CORRUPTION; CREATION OF A SPECIAL WEBSITE; (2) TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES IN ANTI-CORRUPTION LITERACY; HOLDING OF ROUND TABLES AND CONFERENCES; (3) PERIODICAL SOCIOLOGICAL SURVEYING AND ANONYMOUS QUESTIONING OF THE EMPLOYEES; (4) CAREFUL SELECTION OF EMPLOYEES THAT CONTROL AND ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEASURES TO COMBAT CORRUPTION; (5) ENHANCED CONTROL OVER EMPLOYEES WHOSE ACTIVITIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED CORRUPTION RISK; (6) ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES, INCLUDING WITH THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE PUBLIC. COUNTERING CORRUPTION RISKS IMPLIES COORDINATED JOINT EFFORTS OF THE STATE, BUSINESS, EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THEY SHOULD BE SYSTEMIC.
430	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO A PROBLEM THAT DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN HISTORIOGRAPHY HAS NEVER STUDIED: IT COMPARES THE VIEWS OF THE BRITISH DIPLOMATS AND OF THE CADETS ON THE REVOLUTIONARY TERROR IN RUSSIA OF THE PERIOD OF THE FIRST REVOLUTION. FOR THE LATTER, THE BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER WAS A MODEL TO FOLLOW. THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN ON THE BASIS OF DOCUMENTS DEPOSITED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM NATIONAL ARCHIVES (REPORTS AND NOTES OF BRITISH AMBASSADORS AND CONSULS OF THIS PERIOD), MOST OF WHICH WERE FIRST INTRODUCED INTO SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE, AS WELL AS ON MATERIALS FROM THE CADET PERIODICALS, MATERIALS FROM THE CADET CONGRESSES, AND VERBATIM REPORTS OF THE I AND II STATE DUMAS. THE ARTICLE USES A HISTORICAL-TYPOLOGICAL METHOD (FOR CLASSIFYING OPINIONS, CHARACTERISTICS OF PUBLICATIONS IN THE PRESS), A HISTORICAL-GENETIC METHOD (IN ITS CONTENT MOST RELEVANT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HISTORICISM, HELPING TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF TERROR BY BRITISH DIPLOMATS), CHRONOLOGICAL, COMPARATIVE, AND SYSTEMIC METHODS. THE CHRONOLOGICAL SCOPE OF THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO 1905-1907, WHEN THE REVOLUTIONARY TERROR IN RUSSIA REACHED ITS PEAK. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT, IN THE YEARS 1905-1907, TERROR AFFECTED NOT ONLY RUSSIAN CITIZENS, BUT ALSO BRITISH SUBJECTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE. THE ANALYSIS OF DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE REVEALED THAT THE BRITISH, UNLIKE THE RUSSIAN LEFT-WING LIBERALS, WERE EXTREMELY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONARY TERROR BECAUSE IT PREVENTED THE TWO COUNTRIES FROM COMING CLOSER AND SIGNING A FOREIGN POLICY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEM. BRITISH DIPLOMATS BELIEVED THEN THAT IT WAS PREFERABLE TO CARRY OUT THE REFORM OF RUSSIA IN A CONSTITUTIONAL MANNER, WHILE REMAINING WITHIN THE LAW; THEREFORE, THEY PERCEIVED REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE AS HOSTILE. THEY WELCOMED THE DECISIVE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPRESS TERROR AND REGARDED THE SOFTNESS OF THE AUTHORITIES AS THE REASON FOR ITS INCREDIBLE SCOPE. THE BRITISH EVEN PERCEIVED THE INTRODUCTION OF FIELD COURTS BY PRIME MINISTER PYOTR STOLYPIN, AIMED PRIMARILY AGAINST TERRORISTS, AS AN ADEQUATE MEASURE TO COMBAT SUCH "EVIL" AS TERROR. THE BRITISH COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW WAS ALIEN TO LEFT-WING LIBERALS IN RUSSIA. THEY BELIEVED THAT IN THE STRUGGLE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, SIMILAR TO THE BRITISH, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO USE ANY MEANS. THE CADETS USED REVOLUTIONARY TERROR IN THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER, CREATING HEROIC IMAGES OF TERRORISTS ON THE PAGES OF THEIR PRESS. IN THE I AND II DUMAS, IT WAS THE CADETS WHO BLOCKED THE PROCEDURE OF CONDEMNING TERROR INITIATED BY RIGHT-WING DEPUTIES. THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERROR SERIOUSLY IMPEDED LIBERAL REFORMS. THE AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT THE CADETS WERE MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE STRUGGLE THAN ABOUT THE IDEA OF TRANSFORMING THE COUNTRY. MEANWHILE, THEIR EXCESSIVE INCLINATION TO FIGHT THE GOVERNMENT, THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO SEEK A COMPROMISE WITH IT IN THE CREATION OF A NEW RUSSIA, THEIR FOLLOWING ABSTRACT THEORIES CAUSED MISUNDERSTANDING ON THE PART OF BRITISH DIPLOMATS, WHO WERE ALSO ADHERENTS OF THE LIBERAL IDEA.
431	SPEAKING BEFORE THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY LAST FALL, PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH DELIVERED AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT OF AMERICAN PURPOSE. HE RIGHTLY ARGUED THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS AN INTEREST IN POLITICAL FREEDOM IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES, BECAUSE THE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM DENIES PEOPLE PEACEFUL AVENUES FOR EXPRESSING DISSENT AND THUS DRIVES THEM TOWARD SHADOWY, VIOLENT ALTERNATIVES. HE FAIRLY CRITICIZED PAST ADMINISTRATIONS FOR HAVING BEEN TOO TOLERANT OF AUTHORITARIAN ARAB REGIMES. AND HE COMMITTED THE UNITED STATES TO THE DIFFICULT BUT VITAL TASK OF SUPPORTING MORE OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. BUT WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS, POLITICIANS, JOURNALISTS, AND INTELLECTUALS IN THE MUSLIM WORLD-OUR NATURAL PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT-MET PRESIDENT BUSH'S SPEECH WITH SKEPTICISM, EVEN DISDAIN. ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST, HIS WORDS DID LITTLE TO IMPROVE POPULAR PERCEPTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS INTENTIONS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT ARABS REJECT THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. ACCORDING TO RECENT SURVEYS OF THE REGION BY THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE PRESS, SIGNIFICANT MAJORITIES OF PEOPLE FROM MOROCCO TO JORDAN TO PAKISTAN ARE DEMOCRATS: THEY SAY THEY WANT TO LIVE IN SOCIETIES WHERE LEADERS ARE FREELY ELECTED, WHERE FREE SPEECH IS PROTECTED, AND WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS RESPECTED. YET PARADOXICALLY, EQUALLY LARGE MAJORITIES IN THE VERY SAME COUNTRIES NOW INSIST THAT THEY DO NOT "LIKE AMERICAN IDEAS ABOUT DEMOCRACY." SIMILAR CONTRADICTIONS ABOUND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. WASHINGTON IS COMMITTED TO DEFENDING SOUTH KOREA IF WAR BREAKS OUT ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, YET GROWING NUMBERS OF YOUNG SOUTH KOREANS SEE THE UNITED STATES AS A GREATER THREAT TO SECURITY THAN NORTH KOREA. WE ARE WAGING A WAR ON TERRORISM THAT IS AS VITAL TO EUROPE'S SECURITY AS TO OUR OWN, YET INCREASING NUMBERS OF EUROPEANS ASSOCIATE IT WITH SELF-INTERESTED AMERICAN POWER AND THEREFORE PRESS THEIR LEADERS TO REJECT IT. SUCH NEGATIVE FEELINGS RESULT IN PART FROM A NATURAL RESENTMENT OF U.S. MILITARY, ECONOMIC, AND CULTURAL MIGHT, ABOUT WHICH WE CAN DO LITTLE AND FOR WHICH WE NEED NOT APOLOGIZE. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCENTUATED BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS PURSUED ITS GOALS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S HIGH-HANDED STYLE AND ITS GRATUITOUS UNILATERALISM HAVE EMBITTERED EVEN THOSE MOST LIKELY TO EMBRACE AMERICAN VALUES AND INVITED OPPOSITION EVEN FROM THOSE WITH MOST TO GAIN FROM AMERICAN SUCCESSES. ALL AROUND THE WORLD, FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ACCEPT THAT ANY CONNECTION EXISTS BETWEEN THEIR ASPIRATIONS AND THE PRINCIPLES WASHINGTON PREACHES. AS A RESULT, ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES HAS NEVER ENJOYED GREATER POWER THAN IT DOES TODAY, IT HAS RARELY POSSESSED SO LITTLE INFLUENCE. WE CAN COMPEL, BUT FAR TOO OFTEN WE CANNOT PERSUADE. OUR MOST IMPORTANT GLOBAL INITIATIVES, FROM ADVANCING REFORM IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO DEFEATING TERRORISM, WILL LIKELY FAIL, UNLESS THERE IS A CHANGE IN APPROACH OR A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP.
432	THE EVENTS OF 1984 HAVE HAD WORLD-WIDE REPERCUSSIONS FOR SIKHS, NOT ONLY ACROSS THE GLOBE BUT ACROSS TIME. TWENTY-SIX YEARS OF IMPUNITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN ORGANIZING THE SYSTEMATIC MASSACRE OF THOUSANDS OF SIKHS IN INDIA DEMONSTRATES THE OBDURATE NATURE OF STATE POWER TO SILENCE A PEOPLE'S HISTORY/SUFFERING. RATHER THAN SIMPLY REITERATE THE TRAUMA OF 1984, THIS PAPER SITUATES THE EVENTS WITHIN A BROADER CANVAS OF (MODERN/COLONIAL) STATE TERRORISM AND ITS ALIENATING FORCE. TO DO THIS IT IS NECESSARY TO CHART NOT ONLY THE HISTORICAL LEGACY OF COLONIAL VIOLENCE (I.E. THE CONVERSION TO MODERNITY AND THE RULE OF LAW), BUT ALSO THE POLITICAL STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY POWER IN THE THEATRICAL MANUFACTURE OF 1984. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE THEATRICAL NATURE OF POWER, WHICH MONOPOLIZES VIOLENCE THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF LAW, IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT FROM THE DRAMATIC RESPONSE DRAWN FROM THE PEOPLE'S PROTEST, AND THIS CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE IS ELABORATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF TROUBLING DICHOTOMIES. THE APORIA BETWEEN THE VOICE OF LAW AND THE CRY OF JUSTICE, FOR EXAMPLE, REVEALS HOW A FINITE CALCULATION FOR COMPENSATION IS NEVER ABLE TO SILENCE THE INCALCULABLE SUFFERING THAT THE CALL FOR JUSTICE EMERGES FROM. IN THE ECONOMY OF LAW THAT HAS TO RESPOND TO THE CALL FOR JUSTICE IN A FINITE WAY, A CERTAIN SLIPPAGE THEREFORE BECOMES UNAVOIDABLE, SUCH THAT LAW MAY SPEAK OVER AND EVEN AGAINST JUSTICE. THIS APORETIC SLIPPAGE DISCLOSES HOW THE LAW BETRAYS THE ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY OF A JUST RESPONSE TO SUCH AN EXTENT, THAT THOSE OPPRESSED SPEAK ABOUT THE INJUSTICE OF THE LAW: TWENTY SIX YEARS OF IMPUNITY THROUGH THE LAW. A RELATED DICHOTOMY BETWEEN RELIGION AND VIOLENCE REVEALS A MODERN/COLONIAL DISCIPLINING OF RELIGION AS MERELY A SUBJECTIVE MATTER. THIS DISCIPLINING IS AT THE SAME TIME A DE-POLITICIZATION: RELIGION AS INTERIOR AND NON-VIOLENT MEANS THAT ONLY THE STATE CAN BE PUBLIC AND VIOLENT. THUS THE MORAL ASSUMPTION THAT ALL SOCIAL PROTEST MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE NONVIOLENT IS ANOTHER WAY OF ACCEDING TO THE STATE'S MONOPOLY OF VIOLENCE. THIS REDUCTION TO THE SUBJECTIVE DELEGITIMIZES RELIGION'S PUBLIC VOICE AND ROLE EVEN WHEN IT ARISES OUT OF A STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE. THROUGH A RE-UNDERSTANDING OF MARTYRDOM AND RELIGIOUS AWAKENING, A SECOND TRANSITION IN SUBJECTIVITY IS ACKNOWLEDGED, BEYOND THE FIRST TRANSITION OF ENTERING INTO LANGUAGE OR THE SYMBOLIC ORDER. PAIN OFFERS A POSSIBLE ROUTE TO A RE-ORIENTATION IN SUBJECTIVITY-AND IT IS HERE THAT A SPIRIT OF RESISTANCE CAN BE LOCATED, BEYOND THE IDEOLOGICAL POSTURING OF THOSE FOR AND AGAINST VIOLENCE. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE SUBJECTIVE REGISTER, OR POLITICAL LOVE, OF THE 'SAINTLY' IS NOT PRE- DETERMINED, BUT ONE THAT IS OPEN TO ANY RESPONSE. THIS PAPER THUS ARGUES THAT WE MUST REFIGURE HOW WE REMEMBER 1984: BY RECOGNIZING THAT THE OPPRESSED MAY HAVE A RESOURCE IN THE VERY INJUSTICE THAT IMPRISONS THEM, THERE MAY BE A CERTAIN LEGITIMACY TO RELIGIOUS VIOLENCE THAT THE SECULAR STATE HAS FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE LET ALONE ENGAGE WITH.
433	THE PRINCIPLE OF CERTAINTY OF TAXATION IS A BRANCH DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERAL LEGAL FORMAL REQUIREMENT OF CERTAINTY OF LAW. A CERTAIN NATURE OF THE TAX RULE GUARANTEES ITS CORRECT UNDERSTANDING, INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION. THE UNCERTAIN, AMBIGUOUS AND FRAGMENTED TAX AND LEGAL REGULATION IS A PROBLEM AND THE EFFORTS OF SCIENTISTS, LEGISLATORS, JUDGES AND PRACTICING LAWYERS ARE AIMED AT ITS SOLUTION. THE TASK IS TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN TAX LAW. THE ACTS OF OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION ISSUED BY THE FISCAL AUTHORITIES TO CLARIFY THE MEANING OF TAX LAWS AND THEIR APPLICATION REPRESENT ONE OF SUCH TOOLS. THE PRINCIPLES OF COMPETENCE AND RULE OF LAW DEMAND TO IDENTIFY CLEARLY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY TO WHICH THE LAW DELEGATES THE RIGHT TO GIVE OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, IN PRACTICE, THERE IS STILL THE PROBLEM OF DUPLICATION OF THIS FUNCTION BY THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ITS STRUCTURES ON THE ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES HEADED BY THE FEDERAL TAX SERVICE OF RUSSIA. THE PROCEDURE OF PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL CLARIFICATION BY FISCAL AUTHORITIES IS SPECIFIED IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION VERY SPARINGLY. IT IS NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE IN DETAIL IN THE STANDARDS OF THE TAX CODE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION THE DIVISION OF COMPETENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND TAX AUTHORITIES IN THE CONSIDERED SPHERE, TERMS AND PROCEDURES OF THE PUBLICATION OF ACTS - INTERPRETATIONS, THEIR FORMS AND STRUCTURE, HIERARCHY, RULES OF PUBLICATION AND TEMPORAL ACTION, ETC. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE LEGAL NATURE OF OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS. SOME AUTHORS RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE SPECIFIC SOURCES OF TAX LAW, ENDOWING THEM WITH QUALITY OF NORMALIZATION AND OBLIGATION, OTHERS REJECT A "STANDARD" APPROACH, RELATING THE LATTER TO THE ACTS OF CASUAL INTERPRETATION AND STILL OTHERS TAKE AN INTERMEDIATE POSITION, SPECIFYING VARIOUS TEST CRITERIA, WHICH CAN GIVE AN OBLIGATORY (STANDARD) NATURE TO THE DOCUMENTS UNDER CONSIDERATION. IT IS EXPEDIENT TO RESORT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF "A PRIORITY OF SUBSTANCE OVER FORM". TO ESTABLISH THE STANDARD NATURE OF THE ACT IT IS NECESSARY TO BE GUIDED NOT BY THE SET OF ITS FORMAL SIGNS (THE NAME, REQUISITES, STATE REGISTRATION, PUBLICATION), BUT BY ITS SEMANTIC CONTENT. THE GENERAL RULE ABOUT A RECOMMENDATORY, I.E. LEGALLY NON-BINDING NATURE OF THE OFFICIAL EXPLANATIONS CAN HAVE ESSENTIAL EXCEPTIONS. A PART OF SUCH ACTS MAY CONTAIN THE TAX RULES CONCRETIZING TAX LAWS (MAY BE NOT DE JURE BUT DE FACTO). SUCH ACTS ARE ADMISSIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTARY SOURCES OF TAX LAW THE SUBJECT OF OFFICIAL CLARIFICATION IS THE CONTENT OF TAX RULES AND THEIR APPLICATION. THE LAW ALLOWS ONLY THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX RULES, BUT NOT THE ANALYSIS OF CONCRETE SITUATIONS. FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING A TAXPAYER WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TRANSACTIONS WHICH HE JUST PLANS TO MAKE, IT IS OFFERED TO ESTABLISH THE INSTITUTE OF AN ADVANCE TAX RULING.
434	CONDUCTING CASE-COMMENTARY RESEARCH ON THE STYLE OF CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENTS IS A KEY METHOD FOR JUDGES TO PRODUCE LEGAL DOCUMENTS, DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL WRITING AND CREATIVE SKILLS, AND ENHANCE LEGAL THINKING. SUCH A STUDY IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO DEEPEN THE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL POWER OPERATION MECHANISM AND TO IMPROVE THE TRIAL MANAGEMENT MODE. CONSIDERING THE BACKGROUND OF THE JUDICIAL RESPONSIBILITY SYSTEM REFORM, THE LOCALIZATION OF THE RESEARCH PARADIGMS AND CASE-COMMENTARY METHODS OF THE STYLE OF LITIGATION DOCUMENTS CAN HELP REACH THE CONSENSUS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY. IT ALSO HELPS PROMOTE JUDGMENT RULES AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. LEGAL COMMENTARIES CONVEY THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF PUBLIC LEGAL SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC. IT IS NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE THE STYLE OF CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENTS, THE "ONE-STOP" LITIGATION SERVICE WITH THE REFORM PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL COMMITTEES IN CHINA, AND CONDUCT DETAILED RESEARCH ON THE PROCEDURAL RULING FUNCTION AND GUIDING FUNCTION OF THE STYLE OF CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENTS. BY STUDYING THE GUIDING FUNCTION OF CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENT STYLE FOR JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR, LITIGATION PROCEDURE, AND ENTITY PROCESSING, IT IS GOOD FOR JUDGES TO BROADEN THEIR IDEAS AND METHODS TO WRITE CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENTS, ENABLING AN EXAMINATION OF THE LOCALIZATION PATH AND METHOD OF THE LEGAL COMMENTARY RESEARCH PARADIGM AND DEMONSTRATING HOW TO CONTINUE USING THE PARADIGM WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. MOREOVER, THE STUDY EMPHASIZES HOW TO EXERT THE FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LEGAL SERVICES INTEGRATED WITH THE STYLE OF CIVIL LITIGATION DOCUMENTS.
435	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER, IN PARTICULAR, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLES. THE AUTHOR EMPHASIZES THAT PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER ARE MODERN UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED DEMOCRATIC VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION, WHICH SERVE AS A BENCHMARK FOR STATE LEGAL REFORMS IN THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. THE AUTHOR ALSO POINTS OUT THAT THE TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLE IS OF OUTMOST IMPORTANCE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER AND, MOREOVER, THE PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO BE A KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE, WHICH ENSURES PROPER INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND CITIZENS IN A FORM THAT PROVIDES STATE AUTHORITIES OF DIFFERENT BRANCHES WITH INFORMATION IN ALL SPHERES OR ACCESS TO IT, EXCEPT FOR STATUTORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC BODIES SHOULD BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE, EXCEPT FOR THOSE CASES WHEN INFORMATION CONSTITUTES STATE SECRET. FURTHERMORE, THE TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLE NOT ONLY ENSURES PROPER INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS, BUT ALSO POSITIVELY INFLUENCES THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PUBLICITY PRINCIPLE IS A PRINCIPLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER THAT BECOMES APPARENT IN A FORM OF PUBLIC CONTROL EXERCISED OVER THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY. THE PUBLICITY PRINCIPLE CHARACTERIZES PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DEMOCRACY, AND OPEN AND TRANSPARENT ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES THAT ENABLES CITIZENS TO BECOME PERSONALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. MOREOVER, PUBLICITY IS CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH DEMOCRATISATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, WHICH, IN TURN, INDICATES THE PRINCIPLES INTENTION TO BECOME CLOSER TO SOCIETY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY ENSURE EFFICIENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, ESPECIALLY IN THE SPHERE OF LEGAL REGULATION OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER. THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THAT PRINCIPLES OF PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER ARE NOT IDENTICAL. TRANSPARENCY MEANS THE AVAILABILITY OF ELECTRONIC MONEY FOR ALL CITIZENS, WHILE PUBLICITY MEANS NOT ONLY AVAILABILITY, BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO DISCUSS THE COURSE AND RESULTS OF SUCH A PROCESS, THAT IS, A WAY OF FORMING PUBLIC OPINION, ITS EVALUATION OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER, WHICH PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AUTHORITIES SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR WORK. THE PAPER ALSO EXAMINES ISSUES RELATED TO THE LEGAL STATUS OF ELECTRONIC MONEY, THE DEFINITION OF THIS CONCEPT AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL AND IN PRACTICE. THE AUTHOR ANALYZES ISSUES OF CURRENT LEGAL REGULATION OF E-MONEY AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT UNDER THE UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THAT USING ELECTRONIC MONEY ALLOWS SAVING ON CASH MAINTENANCE COSTS, REDUCING TRANSACTION TIME, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ELECTRONIC MONEY KEEPS HAVING THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS TRADITIONAL FIAT MONEY, WHICH MAKES IT HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE TO GET CASH REPLICATED WITH E-MONEY, THOUGH SUCH A TRANSITION STILL REQUIRES A DEVELOPED AND EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. METHODOLOGY. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ARTICLE PREPARATION, A WHOLE RANGE OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL APPROACHES (DIALECTICAL, AS A WAY OF THINKING BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE VIEWS ON THE CONTENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER; ANALYTICAL, BASED ON COGNITIVE ACTIVITY BY PROVING OR REFUTING THE DEFINITION OF TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLICITY IN THE ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER SPHERE; HERMENEUTIC, APPLIED FOR UNDERSTANDING TERMS RELATED TO THE LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES' ACTIVITY IN THE ELECTRONIC MONEY SPHERE; GENERAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH METHODS (LOGICAL, BASED ON ASCENDING FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX, FROM ABSTRACT TO SPECIFIC AS RELATED TO GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LEGAL REGULATION IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER; SPECIAL METHODS (SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL, PARTICULARLY IN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING LEGAL SUPPORT RELATED TO ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER, COMPARATIVE LEGAL RESEARCH, AIMED AT THE EXAMINATION OF FOREIGN EXPERIENCE, FORMAL LEGAL OR FORMAL LOGICAL). RESULTS. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH RESULTS, THE AUTHOR HAS DETERMINED THE PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES ACTIVITY IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER, WHERE THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPARENCY ALLOWS TO ENSURE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS IN THE FORM OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION DERIVED FROM ALL SPHERES OR BY GRANTING ACCESS TO SUCH INFORMATION, EXCEPT FOR THE INFORMATION WITH RESTRICTED ACCESS. ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES SHOULD BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE, EXCEPT IN CASES WHEN IT CONSTITUTES STATE SECRET. THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLICITY NOT ONLY ENSURES INTERACTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS, BUT ALSO HELPS STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW. IN TURN, PUBLICITY AS A PRINCIPLE OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER IS A FORM OF EXERCISING PUBLIC CONTROL OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLICITY CHARACTERIZES DEMOCRACY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO THE NEED TO LEGALLY ENSHRINE ELECTRONIC MONEY AS A MEANS OF PAYMENT IN THE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE AS THE MOST CONVENIENT FORM OF USING ELECTRONIC MONEY, WHICH ALLOWS TO SAVE ON CASH MAINTENANCE COSTS, REDUCE TRANSACTION TIME, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ELECTRONIC MONEY KEEPS HAVING THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS TRADITIONAL FIAT MONEY, WHICH MAKES IT HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE TO GET CASH REPLICATED WITH E-MONEY, THOUGH SUCH A TRANSITION STILL REQUIRES A DEVELOPED AND EFFECTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE CAN BE USED IN LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR LEGAL REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THE ARTICLE MAY ALSO BE USED IN SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE PRINCIPLES OF PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER. IN ADDITION, THE PAPER'S PROVISIONS CAN BE USED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, DURING LECTURES AND SEMINARS ON CIVIL, INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY OF THE OBTAINED RESULTS IS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE EXISTING NORMATIVE AND DOCTRINAL APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER; KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF PUBLICITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CIVIL LEGAL REGULATION OF ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER HAS BEEN SYSTEMATIZED. THE PAPER ALSO IDENTIFIES TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL REGULATION IN THE SPHERE OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TURNOVER.
436	OPEN INNOVATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PHENOMENON IN THE CROWDFUNDING CONTEXT. THIS CONCEPTUAL PIECE TENDS TO OFFER AN INTEGRATIVE DISCUSSION OF THREE IMPORTANT MECHANISMS UPON WHICH STAKEHOLDERS OF A CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM CONDUCT OPEN INNOVATION AND VALUE CO-CREATION IN CROWDFUNDING SITES. THESE MECHANISMS INCLUDE: DIVERSITY, KNOWING, AND NETWORKING. WE ARGUED THAT: 1. DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES FACILITATE MULTIPLE-PARTY VALUE CO-CREATION; 2. KNOWLEDGE OF PLATFORM STAKEHOLDERS IMPROVES QUALITY OF IDEAS; 3. NETWORKING POSITIVELY IMPACTS ON OPEN INNOVATION PERFORMANCE. WITH SUCH DISCUSSIONS, A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IS BUILT AND MORE RESEARCH ISSUES ARE STIMULATED.
437	TO DATE, THE EXPLANATION OF THE NATURE OF THE BASHKIR UPRISINGS OF THE XVII-XVIII CENTURIES IS REDUCED TO FOUR COMMON CONCEPTS: THE INITIAL HOSTILITY OF THE NOMADIC CIVILIZATION TO THE SETTLED WORLD, THE DESIRE OF THE BASHKIRS TO RESTORE THE STRUCTURES OF THE MONGOL EMPIRE OR EVEN CREATE THEIR OWN KHANATE, ANTI-COLONIAL SPEECH, FEUDAL SEPARATISM OF THE BASHKIR NOMADIC NOBILITY. IN OUR OPINION, NONE OF THE PRESENTED CONCEPTS CAN GIVE A CONSISTENT EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF BASHKIR UPRISINGS. IN TURN, WE OFFER A LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE METHOD OF POLITICAL THEOLOGY BY K. SCHMITT. HE REVEALED AN ANALOGY BETWEEN POLITICAL IDEAS AND THEOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF THIS PARTICULAR SOCIETY. WE CLAIM THAT THE POLITICAL IDEAS OF THE BASHKIRS OF THE XVII-XVIII CENTURIES HAD AN ANALOGY WITH THE MYTH OF GENGHIS KHAN, REFLECTED IN LITERARY TEXTS AND THE BASHKIR SHEZHERE. IN THIS MYTH, THE DEEDS OF GENGHIS KHAN ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE CAUSE OF THE EXISTING WORLD ORDER, BUT FURTHER HISTORY TAKES PLACE WITHOUT HIS LEADERSHIP ROLE. THE DEMIURGIC ROLE OF GENGHIS KHAN DID NOT BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE SACRALIZATION OF HIS DESCENDANTS, WHO WERE SUBJECT TO DISPLACEMENT IN CASE THEY VIOLATED THE COMMANDMENTS OF THEIR ANCESTOR. SUCH A POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM EVOKES AN ANALOGY WITH DEISM IN THEOLOGY, WHICH EXPELS A "MIRACLE FROM THE WORLD", FORBIDDING THE SOVEREIGN TO INVADE THE EXISTING LEGAL ORDER. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIVERGENCE OF THE YASA OF GENGHIS KHAN WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW OF KANT AND SCHMITT BEGINS WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE SOVEREIGN WHO DECIDED TO ABOLISH THE CURRENT LAW AND ORDER, I.E. INTRODUCING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. IN GENGHISISM, IT IS EXCLUDED AND ANY VIOLATION OF LAW AND ORDER MUST BE STOPPED BY THE OVERTHROW OF THE RULER. IF AT THE IMPERIAL LEVEL THIS PREROGATIVE BELONGED TO THE KURULTAI, THEN IN BASHKIRIA OF THE XVII-XVIII CENTURIES, DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF AN INSTITUTIONAL ELITE, THIS ROLE WAS PERFORMED BY THE "YYYYNS". AFTER THE VOLUNTARY ACCEPTANCE OF RUSSIAN CITIZENSHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE XVI CENTURY THE MYTH OF GENGHIS KHAN WAS SPREAD BY THE BASHKIRS TO THE RUSSIAN MONARCHS. ALL BASHKIR UPRISINGS OF THE XVII-XVIII CENTURIES WERE THE RESULT OF UNILATERAL VIOLATION BY THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE TERMS OF A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WITH THE BASHKIRS. BASHKIRS BELIEVED THAT RESISTANCE TO A RULER WHO VIOLATED HIS OWN LAWS WAS A MANIFESTATION OF LOYALTY TO THE STATE. PASSIVE RESISTANCE WAS EXCLUDED BECAUSE BASHKIRS COULD NOT BE INTEGRATED INTO THE SOCIAL STRUCTURES OF NEIGHBORING NOMADIC PEOPLES WITHOUT LOSING THEIR IDENTITY. IN THE SOUTHERN URALS, BACK IN THE PERIOD OF THE MONGOL EMPIRE, A SPECIAL VARIANT OF POLITICAL UNIFICATION EMERGED, IN WHICH HORIZONTAL TIES BETWEEN TRIBAL STRUCTURES DOMINATED OVER VERTICAL ONES. SUCH AN EGALITARIAN STRUCTURE OF BASHKIR SOCIETY DID NOT HAVE INTERNAL TOOLS FOR RESOLVING INTERGENERATIONAL CONFLICTS. BASHKIR POLITY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE IMPERIAL STRUCTURE, WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING LAW AND ORDER AND PEACE BETWEEN THE CLANS. FOR THE SAME REASONS, THE BASHKIRS AVOIDED CREATING THEIR OWN KHANATE.
438	THE INSTITUTE OF APPEAL OF CITIZENS TO STATE AUTHORITIES AS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IS STUDIED. ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE THE HIGHEST SOCIAL VALUE AND DETERMINE THE DEGREE OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND OTHER HUMAN FREEDOMS. THE AUTHORS ESTABLISHED THAT THE STATE MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL FOR ITS ACTIVITIES, IN THIS REGARD, ENSURING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IS THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, BUT ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE SUBJECT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IN MANY COUNTRIES IS ENSHRINED AS CONSTITUTIONAL. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PROBLEMATIC ISSUES REMAIN RELATED TO THE DEFINITION OF INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, PROVIDING A MECHANISM FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES USING THE LATEST INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, ETC. THE AUTHORS HAVE FOUND THAT THE INSTITUTE OF CITIZENS' APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AS A MECHANISM FOR EXERCISING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, INCLUDES MANY IMPORTANT AREAS, SUCH AS THE CONDUCT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH FREELY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES; THE FUNCTIONING OF PUBLIC CONTROL; ENSURING THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION, ETC. THE PECULIARITIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTE OF CITIZENS' RECOURSE IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE REALIZATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WERE INVESTIGATED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DYNAMISM OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AT THE PRESENT TIME HAS ALSO INFLUENCED THE FAIRLY RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTE OF CITIZENS' RIGHT TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, WHICH IN TURN HAS AFFECTED THE INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS OF DIFFERENT STATES IN THE POLITICAL PROCESSES IN THE WORLD. THE CONCEPT OF THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAS BEEN FORMULATED. INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WERE ANALYZED AND IDENTIFIED. THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT THE INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITIZENS' RIGHT TO APPEAL TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ARE BASED ON FIVE BASIC PRINCIPLES. THE PROSPECT OF INTRODUCING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE PROCESS OF CITIZENS' APPLICATIONS TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IS CONSIDERED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO VARIOUS SPHERES OF SOCIAL LIFE HAS NOT BYPASSED THEIR INTRODUCTION INTO THE LEGAL SPHERE, WHICH IN TURN LED TO THE PROCESSING OF INCREASING VOLUMES OF INFORMATION IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF THREATS OF VIOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, THROUGH UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO PERSONAL DATA, THEIR THEFT AND USE FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES. SHOWS THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS ARISING FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGIES IN THE WORK WITH THE CITIZENS' APPEAL, WHICH AFFECT THE PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA. THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GREAT BRITAIN, GERMANY, SCOTLAND, USA, ETC., IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SYSTEM OF ELECTRONIC APPEAL AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC PETITIONS AS THE MOST PROGRESSIVE FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS ANALYZED.
439	APPARENTLY, EUROPEAN LEGAL INTEGRATION CURRENTLY FACES ONCE AGAIN ITS MOST FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINAL PROBLEM, I.E.: THE NATURE OF EU SUPRANATIONAL LAW AND ITS RELATION TO THE TRADITIONAL 'SUPERIORITY' OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW WITHIN ITS MEMBER STATES. SINCE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) REPEATEDLY RE-EMPHASIZES THE 'PRIMACY' AND NEEDED EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FORMER, THIS PROVOKES THE QUESTION ABOUT THE LATTER'S REMAINING FUNCTIONAL NATURE.INDIRECTLY, THIS ISSUE GOES ALSO TO THE HEART OF THE EU'S JUDICIAL-SYSTEM OF A 'EUROPEAN MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMPOSITE (EMCRC)'. IT RELATES THUS NOT ONLY TO THE ECJ, BUT ALSO TO THE FUNCTIONS OF MEMBER STATE AUTHORITIES EXERCISING CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW POWERS WITHIN THE OVERALL EU LEGAL INTEGRATION PROCESS. WHILST THIS INTER-INSTITUTIONAL QUESTION HAD RECEIVED A NEW IMPULSE WITH THE GERMAN 'BUNDEVERFASSUNGSGERICHT (BVERFG)'-RULING OF 5 MAY 2020 IN CASE 'ECB-PSPP', IT BECAME FINALLY UNDENIABLE WITH THE DECISION OF 7 OCTOBER 2021 BY THE POLISH 'TRYBUNAL CONSTYTUTYJNY' IN CASE 'K 3/21'; THERE REGARDING THE PERSISTENT EU-POLAND 'RULE OF LAW'-CONFLICT. AT ISSUE IS THUS NOT ONLY A THEORETICAL APPROACH TO LAWS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS, BUT PARTICULARLY ALSO THE EMCRC'S APPROPRIATE INTER-INSTITUTIONAL FUTURE SETTING. ARGUABLY, THIS IN TURN CALLS HOWEVER FOR A COMMENSURATE DIFFERENTIATION OF TERMINOLOGY IN BOTH EU LAW AND NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.THIS ARTICLE ENQUIRES INTO A NECESSARY DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN EU LAW 'PRIMACY/PRECEDENCE' ON THE ONE, AND NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 'SUPREMACY' ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUCH DISTINCTION CANNOT BE BASED ON LEGAL-THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS ALONE. INSTEAD, PARTICULAR ATTENTION DESERVES ALSO HOW THE COURTS FACTUALLY POSITION THEM-SELVES, FUNCTIONALLY, WITHIN THE EMCRC. THE BASIC AIM IS THUS TO SHOW THAT THE LEGAL -CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENTIATION AND THE JUDICIAL-INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTIONS INTERRELATE DECISIVELY.WITH THIS IN MIND, A JUDICIAL SYSTEM SUCH AS THE EMCRC FUNCTIONALLY REMAINS PLAUSIBLE ONLY WHEN IT BUILDS UPON EU LAW 'PRIMACY/PRECEDENCE', WHILE IT MUST RESPECT THE 'SUPREMACY' OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW(S) AS A REACTIVE SAFEGUARD FOR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.ACCORDINGLY, LEGAL 'SUPREMACY' CONSTITUTES A NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PRINCIPLE INDISPENSABLE FOR NATIONAL COURTS OR TRIBUNALS EXERCISING CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW. WHILE SAFE-GUARDING THEIR CONSTITUTIONS' VALIDITIES, IT INDIRECTLY ALSO SECURES THEIR ROLE AS 'GUARDIANS' OVER POSSIBLY EXCESSIVE EU ACTS.BY CONTRAST THERETO, LEGAL 'PRIMACY/PRECEDENCE' ARGUABLY DEFINES THE ECJ'S FUNDAMENTAL PROCEDURAL PREROGATIVE TO REGULARLY LEAD THE WAY WITH INTERPRETATIVE 'INPUTS' INTRODUCED INTO THE EMCRC.HOWEVER, UNDER THE ABOVE BASIC CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION, THE NATIONAL JUDICIAL BODIES' CAPACITY TO 'SUPREMACY'-BASED DISAGREE WITH THE ECJ'S 'PRIMACY/PRECEDENCE'-BASED RUL-INGS CAN ONLY COMMENSURATE WITH THE EMCRC'S FUNCTIONING, IF CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL CONDITIONS ARE MET: INITIALLY, THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OVER ECJ-RULINGS REMAINS AN 'EXCEPTION TO THE RULE', AND THEREFORE, THAT NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BODIES SHOULD 'REGULARLY' ALSO BEAR THE BURDEN TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR EXCEPTIONAL DISAGREEMENTFINALLY, THAT THIS SHOULD NORMALLY BE COMBINED TO A 'CONSTRUCTIVE INPUT'-CONSIDERATION, I.E.,: ONE THAT AVOIDS A 'MISUSE' OF CONSTITUTIONAL LEGAL SUPREMACY AND, INSTEAD, ALLOWS THE EMCRC TO THINK EU LAW CONSTRUCTIVELY FORWARD.TO SUBSTANTIATE THE EXISTENCE OF INDICATIONS SUPPORTING THIS APPROACH, IS THIS ARTICLE'S MAIN OBJECTIVE.
440	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DEFINE A MISSING PERSON AS A LEGAL FACT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ATTRIBUTES OF A MISSING PERSON AS A PHENOMENON TAKING PLACE IN REAL LIFE SHALL POSSESS CERTAIN PROPERTIES AND CHARACTERISTICS IN ORDER TO BECOME A LEGAL FACT. A LEGAL FACT IS A LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND LIFE AND SHALL POSSESS SOCIAL CERTAINTY; AT THAT, THE FACT OF A MISSING PERSON IS PARADOXICAL AND HAS NO SOCIAL CERTAINTY, BUT RATHER SOCIAL UNCERTAINTY. REFLECTING THE FACT OF A MISSING PERSON, WE IDENTIFY THE SOCIAL SITUATION AND ENSURE ITS FIXATION. IN THIS CASE, FIXATION MEANS DOCUMENTATION OF THE FACT OF A MISSING PERSON AND THE MEASURES TAKEN TO RESOLVE THE UNCERTAINTY OF LOCATION OF A CITIZEN, FOR EXAMPLE, ISSUING A CERTIFICATE STATING THAT BASED ON THE APPLICATION REQUEST OF AN INTERESTED PARTY ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO SEARCH FOR A MISSING PERSON. THIS PHENOMENON GIVES RISE TO A LEGAL CONSEQUENCE IF IT IS PROPERLY RECORDED AND IDENTIFIED BY LEGAL MEANS. HERE THE FACTS ARE FIXED, I. E. REGISTERED AND ACKNOWLEDGED, WHICH MEANS CONFIRMATION OF EXISTENCE OF THE FACT AND ITS TRUENESS. UPON RENDERING OF A DECISION TO TREAT A CITIZEN AS MISSING, THE CONSOLIDATION OF FACTS FIXATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT IN A SINGLE ACT CAN BE STATED. BASED ON DOCUMENTATION STATUS, LEGAL FACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS EXECUTED AND UNEXECUTED. IN THIS CASE, WE CAN FOLLOW THE EXECUTION OF A LIFE FACT -MISSING OF A PERSON. IF THE LEGAL FACT OF MISSING PERSON IS CLASSIFIED ON GROUNDS OF VOLITION, IT CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS AN EVENT. MASS MEDIA INFORM US REGULARLY ABOUT MISSING PEOPLE IN QUIET LIFE, WHICH IS CONNECTED WITH DIFFERENT NATURAL CALAMITIES, ANTHROPOGENIC DISASTERS, AND OTHER REASONS. THEREFORE, IT CAN BE STATED THAT AN ABSOLUTE EVENT GIVES RISE TO ANOTHER EVENT -A MISSING PERSON. IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT MISSING OF A PERSON CAN ENTAIL DIFFERENT LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THE PHENOMENON OF A MISSING PERSON CAN BE REGARDED AS A LAW-MAKING FACT. INTERESTED PARTIES GAIN THE RIGHT TO TREAT A PERSON AS MISSING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN CASE OF APPEARANCE OF A MISSING PERSON, THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IN THE FORM OF RESTORATION OF RIGHTS. RIGHTS ARE REINSTATED AFTER THE REVERSAL OF THE DECISION OF A MISSING PERSON. THE EXISTENCE OF OPEN AND LATENT LEGAL FACTS SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED. IT SEEMS THAT IT IS THE MISSING PERSON PHENOMENON THAT PROVIDES FOR MANY LATENT PHENOMENA. A MISSING PERSON AS A LIFE FACT, BY NATURE OF ITS CONSEQUENCES, CAN REPRESENT EITHER A REVERSIBLE OR AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS. A MISSING PERSON REPRESENTS A COMPLEX LEGAL FACT COMPRISING TWO OR MORE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COLLECTIVELY GIVE RISE TO LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF A MISSING PERSON CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ISOLATED EVENT; IT SHOULD BE REGARDED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SITUATION, AS IT REPRESENTS AN ELEMENT OF THE FACTUAL SYSTEM. ON THE GROUNDS OF THE NORMATIVE MODEL DETERMINACY, LEGAL FACTS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS DETERMINATE AND RELATIVELY DETERMINATE. FACTS OF MISSING CITIZENS ARE NOT RARE. IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE URGENCY OF THE PROBLEM OF MISSING PERSONS, WHICH PREVIOUSLY REMAINED ON THE PERIPHERY OF SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS AND LAW-MAKING INITIATIVE.
441	THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY OF THE ARTICLE IS THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE INSTITUTION OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE FEATURES OF ITS INTERACTION WITH LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND LEGAL CULTURE. THE GOAL IS TO SUBSTANTIATE THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE LEGAL REGULATION OF LEGAL LIABILITY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EXISTING FORMS OF INTERACTION WITH LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. THE WORK CARRIED OUT A COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INSTITUTION OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ITS ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF CITIZENS. THE TEAM OF AUTHORS IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING THE PLACE AND ROLE OF LEGAL LIABILITY IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CATEGORY UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING LEGAL ACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR MEASURES OF LEGAL LIABILITY. THE PROBLEM OF A LOW LEVEL OF LEGAL CULTURE CAN MANIFEST ITSELF NOT ONLY IN LEGISLATIVE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. SHORTCOMINGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OFFICIAL INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL NORMS AND EXECUTION OF THE RELEVANT ACT IN SOME CASES CAN ALSO CAUSE UNLAWFUL CONSEQUENCES, AMONG WHICH ARE: UNLAWFUL PROSECUTION, EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY IN VIOLATION OF ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES, ETC. IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, A WHOLE SET OF METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WAS USED, AMONG WHICH ONE CAN SINGLE OUT: THE FORMAL-LEGAL METHOD, THE METHOD OF COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS, SYSTEMIC, DIALECTICAL AND OTHERS. AS A RESULT OF THE RESEARCH, IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE IS A DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SIGNS OF POSITIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS. IN THE ABSENCE OF A HIGH LEVEL OF LEGAL AWARENESS, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE BOTH INTELLECTUAL (VIEWS, IDEAS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL (EMOTIONS, FEELINGS) ASPECTS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POSITIVE ASPECT OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT POSITIVE RESPONSIBILITY, TOGETHER WITH LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, CONTAINS VOLITIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL ASPECTS. THE TEAM OF AUTHORS PUT FORWARD AN OPINION ACCORDING TO WHICH THE POSITIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A MENTAL ATTITUDE IN THE FORM OF A SENSE OF DUTY AND THE NEED TO FULFILL THE EXISTING DUTIES TO THE REQUIRED EXTENT. SUCH A SENSE OF DUTY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE SUBJECT ONLY IN THE ABSENCE OF A STRUGGLE OF MOTIVES, WHICH IS EXCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPED GENERAL LEGAL CULTURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ASSIMILATION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW IS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE PRESENCE OF RESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR AND LEGAL AWARENESS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND LEGAL CULTURE, A CONCLUSION IS MADE ABOUT THE CLOSE INTERACTION OF THESE CATEGORIES AND THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATOR TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SUCH A CONNECTION WHEN EXERCISING HIS LAW-MAKING POWERS. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF POSITIVE LEGAL LIABILITY WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ITS CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES IS ALSO GIVEN. THANKS TO THE STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY AND LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE LEVEL OF CULTURE WILL GROW IF THE IDEAS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE REFLECTED IN LAW.
442	CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF ORIGINALISM SHOULD START BY CONFRONTING A MODEST PUZZLE: MOST COMMENTATORS SUPPOSE THAT ORIGINALISM IS DEEPLY CONTROVERSIAL, WHILE OTHERS COMPLAIN THAT IT MEANS TOO MANY THINGS TO MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL. IS ONE OF THESE VIEWS FALSE? IF NOT, HOW CAN WE SQUARE THE TERM'S AMBIGUITY WITH THE SENSE THAT IT CAPTURES A SUBJECT OF GENUINE DEBATE? PERHAPS SELF-PROFESSED ORIGINALISTS CHAMPION A VERSION OF ORIGINALISM THAT THEIR CRITICS DON'T REJECT, WHILE THE CRITICS CHALLENGE A VERSION THAT PROPONENTS DON'T MAINTAIN. CONTEMPORARY ORIGINALISTS DISAGREE ABOUT MANY THINGS: WHICH FEATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION'S ORIGINAL CHARACTER DEMANDS FIDELITY (FRAMERS' INTENT, RATIFIERS' UNDERSTANDING, OR PUBLIC MEANING); WHY SUCH FIDELITY IS REQUIRED; AND WHETHER THIS INTERPRETIVE OBLIGATION BINDS JUDGES ALONE OR CITIZENS, LEGISLATORS, AND EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS TOO. BUT ON ONE DIMENSION OF POTENTIAL VARIABILITY-THE DIMENSION OF STRENGTH-ORIGINALISTS ARE MOSTLY UNITED: THEY BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO FOLLOW SOME ASPECT OF A PROVISION'S ORIGINAL CHARACTER MUST GIVE THAT ORIGINAL ASPECT PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS (WITH A POSSIBLE EXCEPTION FOR CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO NON-ORIGINALIST JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS). THAT IS, WHEN THE ORIGINAL MEANING (OR INTENT, ETC.) IS ADEQUATELY DISCERNIBLE, THE INTERPRETER MUST FOLLOW IT. THIS IS THE THESIS THAT SELF-PROFESSED ORIGINALISTS MAINTAIN AND THAT THEIR CRITICS (THE NON-ORIGINALISTS) DENY. NON-ORIGINALISTS HAVE CHALLENGED THIS THESIS ON VARIED WHOLESALE GROUNDS, WHICH INCLUDE: THAT THE TARGET OF THE ORIGINALIST SEARCH IS UNDISCOVERABLE OR NONEXISTENT; THAT ORIGINALISM IS SELF-REFITTING BECAUSE THE FRAMERS INTENDED THAT THE CONSTITUTION NOT BE INTERPRETED IN AN ORIGINALIST VEIN; AND THAT ORIGINALISM YIELDS BAD OUTCOMES. THIS ARTICLE PROCEEDS DIFFERENTLY. INSTEAD OF MOUNTING A GLOBAL OBJECTION-ONE PURPORTING TO HOLD TRUE REGARDLESS OF THE PARTICULAR ARGUMENTS ON WHICH PROPONENTS OF ORIGINALISM RELY-I ENDEAVOR TO CATALOGUE AND CRITICALLY ASSESS THE VARIED ARGUMENTS PROFFERED IN ORIGINALISM'S DEFENSE. THOSE ARGUMENTS ARE OF TWO BROAD TYPES-HARD AND SOFT. ORIGINALISM IS "HARD" WHEN GROUNDED ON REASONS THAT PURPORT TO RENDER IT (IN SOME SENSE) INESCAPABLY TRUE; IT IS "SOFT" WHEN PREDICATED ON CONTINGENT AND CONTESTABLE WEIGHINGS OF ITS COSTS AND BENEFITS RELATIVE TO OTHER INTERPRETIVE APPROACHES. THAT IS, HARD ARGUMENTS SEEK TO SHOW THAT ORIGINALISM REFLECTS SOME SORT OF CONCEPTUAL TRUTH OR FOLLOWS LOGICALLY FROM PREMISES THE INTERLOCUTOR ALREADY CAN BE EXPECTED TO ACCEPT; SOFT ARGUMENTS AIM TO PERSUADE OTHERS TO REVISE THEIR JUDGMENTS OF VALUE OR THEIR EMPIRICAL OR PREDICTIVE ASSESSMENTS. THE MOST COMMON HARD ARGUMENTS CONTEND THAT ORIGINALISM IS ENTAILED EITHER BY INTENTIONALISM OR BY BINDING CONSTITUTIONALISM. SOFT ARGUMENTS CLAIM THAT ORIGINALIST INTERPRETATION BEST SERVES DIVERSE VALUES LIKE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. I SEEK TO SHOW THAT THE HARD ARGUMENTS FOR ORIGINALISM ARE FALSE AND THAT THE SOFT ARGUMENTS ARE IMPLAUSIBLE. THE UPSHOT IS NOT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION SHOULD DISREGARD FRAMERS' INTENTIONS, RATIFIERS' UNDERSTANDINGS, OR ORIGINAL PUBLIC MEANINGS. OF COURSE WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS. BUT ORIGINALISM IS A DEMANDING THESIS. WE CAN TAKE THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER OF THE CONSTITUTION SERIOUSLY WITHOUT TREATING IT AS DISPOSITIVE. THAT ORIGINAL INTENTS AND MEANINGS MATTER IS NOT ENOUGH TO RENDER ORIGINALISM TRUE.
443	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE LEGAL STATUS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE CC). THE EXPERIENCE OF STATES WITH DIRECT ACCESS TO A BODY OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION ENABLES TO DISTINGUISH THE CC'S POSITION IN THE SYSTEM OF STATE JURISDICTIONS (WITH PARTICULAR ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF ITS ACTIVITY) AND TO SUBSTANTIATE ITS ROLE IN THE MECHANISM OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO REVEAL THE CC'S PLACE IN THE MECHANISM OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES OF STATES WITH CENTRALIZED CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW AND DIRECT ACCESS TO CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE ON THE PART OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE APPLICANTS' RIGHTS AND THE STATE BUDGET IN THE FORMATION OF JUDICIAL REMEDIES. METHODOLOGY. THE LEADING METHODS OF THE ARTICLE ARE CORRELATION, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, DIALECTICAL AND TECHNICAL LOGIC METHODS OF RESEARCH, ETC. THEY ENABLE TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN THE FIELD OF LEGISLATION OF DIFFERENT EUROPEAN STATES, TO REVEAL THE NATURE OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CONFLICTS AND SPECIFICS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURE FOR THE CC'S CASES. THESE PROBLEMS ARE ALSO INVESTIGATED USING THE METHOD OF SYNTHESIS OF FINANCIAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BODIES OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RESULTS OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IN THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND A CITIZEN. THIS ENABLES TO FORMULATE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE LEGAL REGULATION OF THE CC'S ACTIVITIES IN THE STATES THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT THIS INSTRUMENT OF PROTECTING CONSTITUTIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE KEY RESULTS OF THE STUDY. IT IS PROVEN THAT THE CC IS A SPECIFIC BODY THAT IS THE LAST AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO EXERCISE EXCEPTIONAL SPECIAL POWERS AIMED AT PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. THE ROLE OF THE CC IN THE SYSTEM OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES IS REVEALED. THE CC IS AN AUTONOMOUS BODY OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION WITH A CONSTITUTIONAL STATUS, INDEPENDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE CC IS FACTUALLY AFFILIATED TO THE JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ENGAGED IN JURISDICTION. IT IS PROVEN THAT THE CC'S ACTIVITIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, COMBINED WITH THE POWERS OF THE CC JUDGES TO DECIDE LEGAL MATTERS WITHIN ITS CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION. CASES ARE JUDICIAL IN NATURE, AND THE CC CONSIDERS THEM ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE DECISIONS ADOPTED SHALL BE MANDATORY (BINDING) AND SHALL NOT BE ALTERED BY OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE BODY OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION ARE DISTINGUISHED INTO QUASI-JUDICIAL, COGNITIVE AND EVALUATIVE, HARMONIZING. THE CONSISTENT UNIVERSAL APPROACH OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS ECHR) STATES THAT THE NOTION OF "COURT" DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN CLASSICAL JURISDICTION, INTEGRATED INTO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE PROVES THE REQUIREMENT OF RECOGNIZING THE CC AS A "COURT ESTABLISHED BY LAW" ESSENTIALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY. CONSISTENT APPROACHES AND CRITERIA FOR DEFINING THE NOTION OF "COURT ESTABLISHED BY LAW" FORMULATED BY THE UN COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ECHR'S CASE-LAW PROVE THAT THE CC CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS THE LAST MANDATORY DOMESTIC REMEDY BEFORE APPLYING TO INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUBJECT TO THE CRITERION OF AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY, FORMULATED BY THE ECHR'S CASE-LAW DURING PROCEEDINGS IN THE CC.
444	THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE AND ABROAD; DEVELOP SPECIFIC PROPOSALS TO OPTIMIZE THE LEGISLATIVE PROVISION OF SUCH ACTIVITIES ON THE BASIS OF THE STUDY OF POSITIVE FOREIGN EXPERIENCE WITH A VIEW TO ITS FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE RELEVANT LEGAL REGULATIONS OF OUR STATE. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE INTERROGATION OF LEGAL REGULATIONS OF LEADING FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT REGULATE THE ISSUE OF COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SPHERE, THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THESE COUNTRIES' RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS AIMED AT COUNTERACTING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS STATE MECHANISMS FOR COUNTERING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE US FINANCIAL SYSTEM, EUROPEAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES. METHODOLOGY. THE STUDY IS BASED ON GENERAL SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIAL-SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THE DIALECTICAL METHOD ENABLED TO FORMULATE THE DEFINITION AND DETERMINE THE ESSENCE OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE SYSTEM OF COMBATING CRIME, AS WELL AS MECHANISMS OF ANTI-SHADOWING OF THE UKRAINIAN ECONOMY. THE NORMATIVE-DOGMATIC METHOD ENABLED TO INTERPRET THE CONTENT OF LEGAL REGULATIONS OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION THAT REGULATE THE ISSUE OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD ENABLED TO COMPARE DOCTRINAL APPROACHES TO THE ISSUE OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE AND ABROAD. THE SAME METHOD WAS USED TO ANALYSE LEGISLATION OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES REGARDING THE ISSUE UNDER THE STUDY. METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS ENABLED TO STUDY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OF THE INSTITUTE OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE SOCIOLOGICAL METHOD WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY, CONDUCTED AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE OF UKRAINE, ON THE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT FOREIGN EXPERIENCE IN COUNTERACTING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. THE METHOD OF LEGAL MODELLING ALLOWED MAKING PROPOSALS REGARDING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE INSTITUTE FOR COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE ANALYSIS OF FOREIGN EXPERIENCE OF POLICE ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS SPECIAL BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, IN COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF A COMPARATIVE LEGAL STUDY OF PRINCIPLES, PROVIDED FOR IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND THEIR USE IN THE POLICE ACTIVITIES OF DEMOCRATIC STATES, DETERMINED THE EXPEDIENCY OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE POLICE ACTIVITIES OF THE BODIES OF THE NATIONAL POLICE OF UKRAINE. RELEVANCE/ORIGINALITY. THE STUDY PROVED THAT THE LEGAL BASIS FOR COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE EXAMINED STATES IS THE CONSTITUTION AND NATIONAL LAWS, AS WELL AS SPECIALIZED LEGAL REGULATIONS, WHICH DEFINE THE STATUS, RIGHTS AND DUTIES, THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPLOYEES OF SPECIAL SUBJECTS IN COMBATING ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, COMPETENCIES ARE CLEARLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN NATIONAL AND SPECIAL AUTHORITIES TO EXCLUDE DUPLICATION OF POWERS. IN VIEW OF THE PROVED NECESSITY OF CREATING AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF COUNTERACTION TO ORGANIZED CRIME IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF UKRAINE, POSITIVE FOREIGN EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTATION CAN BECOME THE DRIVING FORCE TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL ORDER IN OUR STATE.
445	ARREST OF NIKOLAS FOUQUET, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF FINANCES OF LOUIS XIV, WHICH TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1661, IS ONE OF THE KEY EVENTS NOT ONLY OF THE REIGN PERIOD OF THIS MONARCH (1643-1715) BUT ALSO IN THE HISTORY OF WHOLE FRANCE BECAUSE SINCE THAT MOMENT THE INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT OF LOUIS XIV BEGINS. HOWEVER, THIS EVENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NOT ONLY AS A POLITICAL ACTION BUT AS A REPRESENTATIVE DEED, AS ONE OF THE IMAGE-MAKING ELEMENT OF LOUIS. UNTIL NOW WHEN WE SPEAK OF REPRESENTATION OF THE KING IT IS ACCUSTOMED TO PRESENT COURT BALLET, FESTIVALS, CONSTRUCTION OF VERSAILLES AND OTHER KING'S RESIDENCES AND BUILDINGS, CONSTRUCTION OF MOUNTED AND FOOT STATUES OF THE KING ON THE MAIN SQUARES OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE KINGDOM AS EXAMPLE. THE REPRESENTATION ALSO MAY INCLUDE THEATRICAL PRODUCTIONS OF MOLIERE AND RACINE, MUSIC OF LULLY AND OTHER COMPOSERS OF THE GREAT AGES, LITERATURE AND ART OF THE TIME. ALL THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF LOUIS XIV, SO CAREFULLY AND PAINSTAKINGLY CREATED BY THE KING HIMSELF AND HIS TEAM THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN, WAS VARIED AND ALL ENCOMPASSING. ALSO, SOME EVENTS OF HIS RULE (NOT JUST THE WAR EVENTS) MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE ROYAL REPRESENTATION, AS EVIDENCED BY THE DISPLAY OF THE FALL OF FOUQUET IN LE BRUN'S PROGRAM, DESIGNED FOR THE CEILING OF THE MIRROR GALLERY OF VERSAILLES. USING THE CONVENIENT POLITICAL SITUATION (THE DEATH OF MAZARIN AND, AS HE THOUGHT, THE IMMATURITY OF THE MONARCH) FOUQUET TRIED TO BREAK THE "MONOPOLY" OF THE KING, IN THE ROLE OF THE CHIEF PATRON OF ARTS, AND THE MAIN REPRESENTATIONAL IMAGES. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VAUX-LE-VICOMTE CASTLE, WHICH OUTBID ALL THE KING'S RESIDENCES WITH ITS BEAUTY, THE CONCEPTION OF ITS INTERIOR DECOR (FOR EXAMPLE, THE IMAGE OF THE SUN NEAR FOUQUET'S EMBLEM) IN OUR OPINION SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A REAL CHALLENGE TO LOUIS XIV. THE HISTORIANS FOUND THE MANIFESTATION OF THE JEALOUS TEMPER OF LOUIS IN HIS REACTION TO THE OBSERVED THINGS. HOWEVER, WE ARE SURE THAT THE KING COULD NOT BEHAVE OTHERWISE BUT REMOVE FOUQUET IF CONSIDERING THIS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE POINT OF VIEW. ARREST AND THE TRIAL OF FOUQUET PERMITTED LOUIS XIV NOT ONLY TO GET RID OF A MAJOR OBSTACLE ON HIS WAY TO MONOCRACY (IF WE CAN SAY SO) AND TO FORM HIS OWN MANAGEMENT TEAM BUT ALSO TO APPROVE HIMSELF AS A SOVEREIGN, WHO POINTEDLY FOLLOWS THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREES WITH THE CUSTOMARY VIEW ON THE WAY OF GOVERNING NAMED ''ABSOLUTISM''. THIS BECOMES THE SIGN OF COMING OF THE AGE OF STABILITY AND PROSPERITY IN THE KINGDOM, WHICH HAD LONG BEEN IN THE STATE OF INTERNAL INSTABILITY. LATER LOUIS XIV WILL ACT THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE WARS. ALL OF HIS WARS WILL NOT HAVE IMPERIALIST CHARACTER, AS IT SOMETIMES SEEMS TO HISTORIANS. IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC IN FRANCE AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THOSE WARS LOOK AS ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND THE LEGITIMATE RIGHTS OF THE KING OR HIS RELATIVES.
446	WHY HAVE THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REMAINED SO SINGULARLY RESISTANT TO DEMOCRATIZATION? WHILE THE NUMBER OF ELECTORAL DEMOCRACIES HAS NEARLY DOUBLED SINCE 1972, THE NUMBER IN THIS REGION HAS REGISTERED AN ABSOLUTE DECLINE. I TODAY, ONLY TWO OUT OF TWENTY-ONE COUNTRIES QUALIFY AS ELECTORAL DEMOCRACIES, DOWN FROM THREE OBSERVED IN 1972.(2) STAGNATION IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THE GUARANTEE OF POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. WHILE THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES DESIGNATED FREE BY FREEDOM HOUSE HAS DOUBLED IN THE AMERICAS AND IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, INCREASED TENFOLD IN AFRICA, AND RISEN EXPONENTIALLY IN CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPE OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN NO OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA.(3) AGGREGATE SCORES IN 2002 DIFFER LITTLE FROM 1972. FIFTEEN COUNTRIES ARE DESIGNATED NOT FREE, FIVE PARTLY FREE, AND ONLY ONE FREE (SEE TABLE 1). WHILE A FEW COUNTRIES, NOTABLY MOROCCO, JORDAN, BAHRAIN, AND YEMEN, HAVE REGISTERED NOTEWORTHY PROGRESS TOWARD POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION IN THE PAST DECADE, OVERALL THE VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES HAS FAILED TO CATCH THE WAVE OF DEMOCRATIZATION THAT HAS SWEPT NEARLY EVERY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD. EXPLANATIONS SUGGEST A LITANY OF REGIONAL FAILURES. FIRST, CIVIL SOCIETY IS WEAK AND THUS IS AN INEFFECTIVE CHAMPION OF DEMOCRACY. LABOR UNIONS ARE EMPTY SHELLS; BUSINESSMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS LACK CREDIBLE AUTONOMY; NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS LACK INDIGENOUS GROUNDING. THE WEAKNESS OF ASSOCIATIONAL LIFE UNDERMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTERVAILING POWER IN SOCIETY THAT CAN FORCE THE STATE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO POPULAR PREFERENCES. IT ALSO CONTRACTS THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE IN COLLECTIVE DELIBERATION, STUNTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CIVIC CULTURE, THAT ESSENTIAL UNDERPINNING OF VIBRANT DEMOCRACY.(4) SECOND, THE COMMANDING HEIGHTS OF THE ECONOMY REMAIN LARGELY IN STATE HANDS. DESPITE NEARLY TWO DECADES OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, THE PUBLIC SECTOR CONTINUES TO ACCOUNT FOR A MAJOR SHARE OF EMPLOYMENT AND GNP GENERATION IN MOST COUNTRIES.(5) THIS LEGACY OF STATIST IDEOLOGIES AND RENT-FUELED OPPORTUNITIES UNDERMINES THE CAPACITY TO BUILD AUTONOMOUS, COUNTERVAILING POWER TO THE STATE IN SOCIETY. THIRD, PEOPLE ARE POOR; LITERACY RATES ARE LOW; AND INEQUALITY IS SIGNIFICANT. IT IS SADLY, COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF PATRIMONIAL RULE ARE GREATLY DISADVANTAGED IN THIS INSTITUTIONAL ENDOWMENT. PERSONALISTIC REGIMES, BY DEFINITION, PRIVILEGE GOVERNMENT BY THE RULER'S DISCRETION, NOT RULE OF LAW. GENERALLY, PATRIMONIAL REGIMES DO NOT HAVE THE EFFECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL BUREAUCRACIES, POLICE, AND OTHER STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A ROBUST DEMOCRACY. THUS, CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN POSTPATRIMONIAL REGIMES IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING.(68) IN THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE STATE INSTITUTIONS, REMOVING AN OPPRESSIVE COERCIVE APPARATUS WILL LEAD, NOT TO DEMOCRACY, BUT RATHER TO AUTHORITARIANISM OF A DIFFERENT STRIPE OR, WORSE, CHAOS. TO ANCHOR DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION, POLITICAL REFORMERS MUST FOCUS ON BUILDING EFFECTIVE, IMPARTIAL STATE INSTITUTIONS, NURTURING ASSOCIATIONS THAT REACH ACROSS ETHNIC LINES AND UNITE PEOPLE AROUND COMMON ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL INTERESTS, AND FOSTERING ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WILL INCREASE PER CAPITA GNP INTO THE ZONE OF DEMOCRATIC POSSIBILITY.(69) THIS CHALLENGE IS GARGANTUAN BUT IS LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE FACING MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. IN FACING THIS CHALLENGE, AS IN SO MANY WAYS, THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA ARE HARDLY EXCEPTIONAL AT ALL.
447	AMIDST MYANMAR (BURMA)'S POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS THE FOREST SECTOR REMAINS AN IMPORTANT AREA AWAITING DEMOCRATISATION. FORESTS HISTORICALLY COVERED OVER 50% OF THE COUNTRIES' LAND AREA, AND HAVE BEEN OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE FOR BOTH LOCAL LIVELIHOODS, THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AND 'ECOSYSTEM SERVICES' SUCH AS BIODIVERSITY AND CATCHMENT HYDROLOGY. THE EXPORT TIMBER TRADE HAS HOWEVER PLAYED A DECISIVE ROLE IN DETERMINING FOREST SECTOR POLICY AND INDEED HAS EXERTED A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON OVERALL NATIONAL POLITICS SINCE THE COLONIAL ERA BEGAN AND CONTINUING TO THE PRESENT DAY. UNDER THE POST-INDEPENDENCE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THE TIMBER TRADE INVOLVED EVER MORE UNSUSTAINABLE PLUNDER, PARTICULARLY FROM THE 1970S, RAPIDLY DEGRADING FORESTS. BUT NOW REFORM OF MYANMAR'S TIMBER TRADE IS ON THE NATIONAL POLITICAL AGENDA, REFORM WHICH WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR THE NATION'S TRANSITION TOWARDS AN EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY. NEW LEGISLATIVE MEASURES WITHIN CONSUMING COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE EU, TO CHALLENGE ILLEGALLY SOURCED TIMBER AND WOOD PRODUCT SUPPLIES HAVE BEGUN TO EXERT A CATALYTIC INFLUENCE ON MYANMAR'S FOREST POLICIES, AND CONVERGING WITH DOMESTIC CIVIL SOCIETY PRESSURES HAVE LED IN 2013 TO THE INITIATION OF A FORMAL 'FOREST LAW ENFORCEMENT, GOVERNANCE AND TRADE' (OR FLEGT) BILATERAL PROCESS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE GOVERNMENT OF MYANMAR. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE NATURE OF MYANMAR'S CURRENT TIMBER TRADE AND OF THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO THE EMERGING FLEGT PROCESS. WE ARGUE THAT THERE ARE EIGHT KEY ASPECTS OF MYANMAR'S TIMBER TRADE OVERDUE FOR DEMOCRATIC REFORM, WHICH THE FLEGT PROCESS PUTS INTO SHARP RELIEF: 1) RESOLUTION OF ETHNIC CONFLICTS PRIMARILY IN UPLAND FORESTED AREAS, 2) REFORM OF FOREST TENURES; 3) A REVIEW OF OVERALL FOREST SECTOR POLICIES AND THE APPROPRIATE PLACE OF TIMBER PRODUCTION; 4) REFORM OF MILITARY ERA STATE TIMBER INSTITUTIONS, 5) A RETURN-TO SILVICULTURALLY BASED SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT; 6) RESTRUCTURING OF THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AWAY FROM 'CRONY' DOMINATION; 7) MEASURES TO COMBAT ILLEGAL LOGGING AND ASSURE THE RULE OF LAW; AND 8) CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. THIS 'SHOPPING LIST' OF DEMOCRATIC REFORMS IMPLIES A MAJOR AND UNDOUBTEDLY DIFFICULT PROCESS AHEAD, AND SUCCESS IS FAR FROM CERTAIN. FROM 2013 PROMISING INITIAL PROGRESS HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON SEVERAL OF THESE AREAS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF MYANMAR MAY GIVE THE INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS RAPIDLY DEMOCRATISING, ON THE GROUND ONLY LIMITED SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES ARE YET EXPERIENCED IN RURAL AREAS, AND RESISTANCE TO REFORM PERSISTS AMONGST THE MILITARY AND THEIR COMMERCIAL PARTNERS. A SPECTRUM OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR FOREST SECTOR REFORM MAY BE FORESEEN, FROM MERE TOKEN IMPROVEMENTS ON THE DICTATORSHIP-ERA 'BUSINESS AS USUAL' TO A THOROUGH REALISATION OF DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS. THE OUTCOME WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETY, PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES, TIMBER MERCHANTS PARTICULARLY THE POWERFUL SO-CALLED 'CRONY' AND PROXY MILITARY BUSINESS INTERESTS, AND THE INTERMEDIATING POWERS OF GOVERNMENT (INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT RENT-SEEKING 'SHADOW STATE'), THE EU, AND THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THAT DRIVE THE DEMAND FOR BURMESE TIMBER. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FLEGT PROCESS CAN REINFORCE THE WIDER DEMOCRATISATION PROCESS MAY BE A DECISIVE FACTOR. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
448	UNIVERSITY, THE PROBLEM OF IMPLEMENTING THE IDEA OF A SOCIAL STATE IS CONSIDERED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF STATE-LEGAL MONISM AND PLURALISM AT THE LEVEL OF HUMANITY, THAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EMERGENCE OF A UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED MODEL OF SUCH A STATE OR THE INEVITABILITY OF THE CO-EXISTENCE OF VARIOUS SUCH MODELS DUE TO NATIONAL, ECONOMIC, CULTURAL FACTORS OPERATING IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES.ATTENTION IS DRAWN TO THE FACT THAT SUCH A PROBLEM IS ALSO RELEVANT IN RELATION TO THE IDEAS OF A DEMOCRATIC AND RULE-OF-LAW STATE. IN GENERAL, THE COINCIDENCE OF FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF STATES REFLECTED IN MODERN CONSTITUTIONS IS ACCOMPANIED BY STATEMENTS ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF UNIFIED CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. TO AN EVEN GREATER EXTENT, THIS IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SEARCH FOR A SOLUTION TO THE SO-CALLED SOCIAL ISSUE. THE THESES UNDERLYING THE CONCEPT OF THE WELFARE STATE BY L. VON STEIN ARE PRESENTED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS INDICATED THAT, IN HIS OPINION, THE SIMPLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM OF THE POOR CLASS IS NOT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE "SOCIAL ISSUE". THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF A SOCIAL STATE IS SHOWN, DISCUSSIONS ARE TOUCHED UPON REGARDING THE UNDER-STANDING OF ITS ESSENCE AND THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE REVEALED DURING THE SOCIAL REFORMS CARRIED OUT BY SOCIO-DEMOCRATIC AND LIBERAL FORCES IN CAPITALIST STATES AT THE END OF THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY.THE MAIN APPROACHES TO THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE SOCIAL STATE ARE REVEALED (THE "SIMPLE" PROCLAMATION OF "SOCIAL" STATEHOOD IN THE CONSTITUTION; THE CLEAR FORMATION OF THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF SUCH A STATE; THE ABSENCE OF AN INDICATION OF THE SOCIAL NATURE OF THE STATE). THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF THE WELFARE STATE CARRIED OUT BY G. ESPING-ANDERSEN, AS WELL AS MODERN RESEARCHERS OF RUSSIA AND NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES ARE ANALYZED. IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT THE VERY EXISTENCE OF A "SOCIAL ISSUE" AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ONE OR ANOTHER OF ITS SOLUTIONS ARE GRADUALLY BECOMING GENERALLY RECOGNIZED. DESPITE THIS, THE FIXATION OF THE SOCIAL CHARACTER OF THE STATE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED THE SAME UNIVERSAL DISTRIBUTION AS, FOR EXAMPLE, THESES ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL NATURE OF THE STATE. BOTH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IDEA OF A WELFARE STATE WHERE IT IS LEGALLY RECOGNIZED, AND ITS DECLARED "PROJECTS" ARE VERY DIVERSE, WHILE THE TYPOLOGY OF THE WELFARE STATE IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER STUDY. THE SOCIAL MODEL, THE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH DETERMINES THE POSITION OF THE STATE IN RELATION TO SOCIETY, IS, ON THE ONE HAND, THE RESULT OF THE EVOLUTION OF A COMPLEX OF FACTORS SPECIFIC TO EACH COUNTRY, AND ON THE OTHER, THE RESULT OF A CONSCIOUS CHOICE. DIFFERENT MODELS OF THE WELFARE STATE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT DEGREES OF REALIZATION OF THE INTERESTS OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES, A DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BEGINNINGS OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE. ACCORDINGLY, THESE MODELS ARE "ATTRACTIVE" TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS TO VARYING DEGREES, THEY COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE IDEA OF A SOCIAL STATE CAN BE REDUCED TO A CERTAIN UNITY, WHEREAS THE WAYS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION ARE INEVITABLY MULTIPLE.
449	THE PAPER PRESENTS A NEW TAKE ON THE RUSSIAN STATE-SANCTIONED INSPECTIONS. SCHEDULED AND SURPRISE INSPECTIONS INTERCONNECT. MORE SO, THEY MAKE UP CHAINS OF EVENTS: A SCHEDULED INSPECTION CAN RESULT IN SEVERAL SURPRISE ONES AIMED AT CORRECTING THE ORIGINAL VIOLATION. THE PAPER DEFINES THESE CHAINS AS CONTINUOUS INSPECTIONS. IN ORDER TO PROVE THIS THESIS, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME INSPEC-TIONS ARE A CONTINUOUS AND UNINTERRUPTED AFFAIR, A CONSTANT INTERPLAY BETWEEN AN INSPECTORATE AND AN INSPECTED ORGANIZATION. THE RESEARCH USES A WIDE ARRAY OF DATASETS SHOWING THE ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSPECTORATE ACTIVITIES BY OWNERSHIP OF ORGANIZATIONS, THEIR SIZE, AND TYPE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE PAPER ANALYZES THE LIMITATIONS OF A RISK-ORIENTED APPROACH AND ITS APPLICATION. THE RESEARCH DIS-TINGUISHES BETWEEN THE INSPECTORATES FOCUSING ON ORGANIZATIONS AND REAL ESTATE OBJECTS BELONGING TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS. THIS DELINEATION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIS-TRIBUTION OF INSPECTORATES FOR PROVIDING A PROPER EVALUATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK-LOADS. THE DISCUSSION ANALYZES THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK. THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL SETTING PROVIDES MINIMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMIZATION OR TARGETING. THEREFORE, IGNOR-ING THE CONTINUOUS NATURE OF THE INSPECTION LEADS TO A DISTORTED VIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF RULES AND BUSINESS PROCESSES IS THE KEY TO THE REFORM'S SUCCESS.
450	THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL NORMS OF ARTICLE 67.1 OF THE RUS- SIAN CONSTITUTION. THESE LEGAL NORMS ARE LEGAL MEANS OF REALIZING THE SUBJECTIVE RIGHT TO POSSESS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PAST OF THE STATE AND SOCIETY AND PROVID- ING GUARANTEES IN OBTAINING SUCH KNOWLEDGE. THE PURPOSE OF ARTICLE IS TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOME HISTORICAL FACTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF LEGALIZATION AND MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF LEGAL IMPACT ON PUBLIC RELATIONS. THE METHODOLOGY. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WAS USED IN COMBINATION WITH HISTORICAL AND LOG- ICAL METHODS OF COGNITION. IT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE THEORETICAL, FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 67.1 OF THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION. THE FORMAL LEGAL METHOD WAS ALSO USED. IT DETERMINED THE VECTOR OF ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL SOURCE AND THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE LEGAL NORMS OF ARTICLE 67.1, AS WELL AS THE LEGAL AND TECHNICAL FEATURES OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THE ARTICLE STIPULATES A SET OF THEORETICAL, FACTUAL AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 67.1 OF THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SYNTHESIS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND HISTORICAL MEMORY, THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS THE PAST OF A PERSON, SOCIETY AND THE STATE, LIES AT THE BASIS OF LEGAL PRACTICE. SUCH SYNTHESIS CONTAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUBJECTIVE RIGHT TO POSSESS OBJECTIVELY VERIFIED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST AND CREATE GUARANTEES IN OBTAINING SUCH KNOWLEDGE. SCIENTIFIC HISTORICAL AND LEGAL EXPERIENCE IS DEFINED AS A NECESSARY CONDITION IN ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF FORMING AN INDIVIDUAL AND A CITIZEN, RESISTANT TO IGNORANCE AND MISUNDERSTANDING OF HIS NATIONAL IDENTITY, REVEALS ITS POSSIBILITIES IN SUBSTANTIATING AND VERIFYING A HISTORICAL FACT, AS WELL AS WITHIN THE PERMISSIBLE LIMITS OF THEIR LEGALIZATION. CONCLUSIONS. LEGAL MATTER IS SYSTEMATIC AND IS STRICTLY ORGANIZED, THEREFORE IT CAN NEITHER BE INTERPRETED ARBITRARILY, NOR APPLIED UNREASONABLY. ARTICLE 67.1 OF RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION INCLUDES FOUR PARTS, EACH OF WHICH DETERMINES THE SUBSEQUENT ONE. THESE PARTS ARE ALSO IN SEMANTIC CONNECTION WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND DECLARATIONS, WHICH TOGETHER DETERMINE THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL REGULATION OF A SPECIAL KIND OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - RELATIONS TO THE PAST. THE STATE AS A SUBJECT OF THESE RELATIONS, ON THE ONE HAND, IS THE CREATOR OF CONDITIONS FOR A REPRESENTATIVE SCIENTIFIC SEARCH AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIABLE HISTORICAL FACTS, FOR THE SUBSEQUENT POPULARIZATION OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESULT. ON THE OTHER HAND, STATE LEGALLY FIXES SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED FACTS OF STATE AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, INDICATING UNITY AND CONTINUITY. ARTICLE 67.1 OF THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE LEGALLY THE WELL-ESTABLISHED HISTORICAL FACTS. A HISTORICAL FACT BECOMES A CONSTANT OF HISTORICAL HERITAGE FOR SOCIETY WHEN IT RECEIVES PUBLIC RECOGNITION. THE LOSS OF SUCH CONSTANT IS AN IRREVERSIBLE LOSS (POSSIBLY EVEN THE DESTRUCTION OF A PART OR A WHOLE SOCIETY). IN THIS CASE HISTORICAL FACT CAN BE DEFINED AS A HISTORICAL TRUTH AND MAY BECOME A SUBJECT TO LEGALIZATION, SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRING THE STATUS OF A LEGAL NORM: PRINCIPLE, DEFINITIVE, DECLARATIVE, PRESCRIPTIVE OR LOGICAL RULE OF LAW. THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF HISTORICAL TRUTH SHOULD BE PERCEIVED NOT AS THE OPPOSITE OF HISTORICAL UNTRUTH (LIE), NOT IN THE SENSE OF "THIS IS GOOD, BUT THIS IS BAD" AND "WHO BENEFITS FROM", BECAUSE EMOTIONALITY GOES BEYOND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF HISTOR- ICAL TRUTH SHOULD BE PERCEIVED AS THE OPPOSITE OF AN UNSCIENTIFIC, HYPOTHETICALLY ASSUMED, YET UNPROVEN HISTORICAL FACT.
451	THE PRESENTED WORK IS AN ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN NON-EU STATES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS AND EASTERN EUROPE WITH WHICH THE EU ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED, AND UKRAINE, INCLUDING ASPECTS OF THE IMPACT OF THE DCFTA (DEEP AND COMPREHENSIVE FREE TRADE AREAS). THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS, THE EQUALITY OF COUNTRIES, AND THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE PROGRESSION AND THE RAPID PACE OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE DCFTA TOWARDS THE COUNTRIES OF THE BALKAN REGION. THE IDENTIFIED COUNTRIES SEEK FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU. ALTHOUGH THE EU DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THESE COUNTRIES, IT RECOGNIZES "EUROPEAN PROSPECTS", THAT IS, MEMBERSHIP IN THE EU, THE COMMITMENTS TO ADOPT OR APPROACH EU LAWS AND POLICIES, MADE BY BOTH GROUPS OF COUNTRIES, HAVE MUCH IN COMMON. THIS MAKES THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE BALKAN REGION AND THE MEMBER STATES OF THE DCFTA A SOUND AND POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT ONE. SUCH COMPARISON IS FACILITATED BY NUMEROUS SOURCES, QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENTS, AND OFFICIAL RATINGS. FIGURATIVELY BY ANALYTICAL INDICATORS, THE COUNTRIES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THE FIRST GROUP OF LEADING COUNTRIES (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO) FOR WHICH IN FEBRUARY 2018 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION PROPOSED TO CONSIDER 2025 AS THE POSSIBLE DATE OF ACCESSION TO THE EU. THE SECOND GROUP (ALBANIA AND MACEDONIA), FOR WHICH THE DATE OF ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS IS CONDITIONALLY OPEN IN 2019. THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDES BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, KOSOVO, FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO DATES, AND TURKEY, THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH WHICH ARE SUSPENDED. FOR COMPARISON, IF WE TAKE BOTH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS OF UKRAINE, IT IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE BALKAN STATES OF THE SECOND GROUP AND OUTSTRIPS THE STATES OF THE THIRD GROUP. THE PROSPECT OF EU MEMBERSHIP WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE STRONGEST EXTERNAL FACTOR OF INTERNAL POLITICAL CHANGES IN THE COUNTRIES SURROUNDING THE EU. ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING TRENDS IS THE STEADY DECLINE IN THE STANDARDS OF POLITICAL GOVERNANCE IN ALL COUNTRIES, FOR WHICH THE EU EXPANDS ITS MEMBERSHIP PERSPECTIVE. ONE OF THE MAIN MANIFESTATIONS OF POOR GOVERNANCE IN THE BROADER NEIGHBOURHOOD IS THE WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION AND IMPUNITY OF OFFICIALS. WEAK RULE OF LAW AND INEFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES HAVE BECOME COMMON PRACTICE IN ALL DIFFERENT STATES AND HAVE ALLOWED CURRENT OFFICIALS TO ACT IMPUNITY DURING THEIR TERM OF OFFICE. THE IDENTIFIED RESULTS CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTION DOMINATING IN POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC CIRCLES THAT A CREDIBLE PROSPECT OF EU MEMBERSHIP IS STEADILY GENERATING AN INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO DEMOCRATIC CHANGES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE WAS ASSESSED BY THE INDICATORS OF COMPETITIVENESS OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY (GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX, CORRUPTION PERCEPTIONS INDEX, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX, EASE OF DOING BUSINESS INDEX, INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM, INDEX OF GLOBALIZATION, SEDA (SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSESSMENT)); GDP DYNAMICS; THE VOLUME OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT; ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF THE POPULATION. IN PRACTICE, THE EU APPLIES AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMMON ECONOMIC POLICY INSTRUMENTS FOR THE BALKANS AND MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE DCFTA, IN SPITE OF THE POLITICAL (OR RHETORICAL) DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES, GIVEN THE CATEGORIZATION OF MEMBERSHIP PROSPECTS. THE CONVERGENCE OF THE ACTUAL EU POLICY HAS TAKEN PLACE. THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS AND THE DCFTA HAVE RAISED THE LEVEL OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IN GEORGIA, MOLDOVA, AND UKRAINE AT THE LEVEL OF THE BALKAN COUNTRIES WHILE THE EXPANSION PROCESS FOR THE BALKAN COUNTRIES HAS NOT ADVANCED.
452	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF SUBJECTS, WHICH, UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REFORM AND CHANGES OF THE GUIDELINES IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CITIZEN, CARRY OUT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE SPHERE OF RELATIONS THAT COVER THE ESSENCE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. IT IS PROVED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW THROUGH THE LENS OF GOVERNANCE IS DOUBTFUL AND DOES NOT FULLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC RELATIONS. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO RETURN TO THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE STATE AND ITS INTERACTION WITH CITIZENS, WHICH HAS A MANIFESTATION IN PUBLIC, NOT STATE; IN ADMINISTRATION, NOT GOVERNMENT. THE AUTHORS SUBSTANTIATE THAT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS THE ACTIVITY OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A CONCERTED INFLUENCE ON SPECIFIC PUBLIC RELATIONS BY MEANS OF SPECIFIC METHODS, TOOLS, FORMS AND AIMS TO SECURE PUBLIC INTERESTS.THE RELATION BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS OF "SUBJECT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION" AND "PUBLIC MANAGEMENT" IS INVESTIGATED. THE PROPOSALS OF THE LEADING UKRAINIAN ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENTISTS REGARDING THE ESSENCE OF THE CATEGORY OF "PUBLIC MANAGEMENT" ARE ANALYZED AND THE REASONS FOR THE DUALISM OF APPROACHES TO ITS DEFINITION IN THE UKRAINIAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL DOCTRINE ARE REVEALED. IN ADDITION, THE SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ARE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR COMPETENCE, SCOPE, FUNCTIONS, AND OBJECTIVES OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THE SUBJECT OF THE RESEARCH IS THE SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE PURPOSE IS A STUDY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEFINING CHANGES EXPERIENCED BY GOVERNING ENTITIES AS A RESULT OF REFORMATTING THE CONCEPT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND SOCIETY IN UKRAINE. METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE RESEARCH IS A SET OF METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THE METHODOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION IS BASED ON A SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS THAT DETERMINED ITS DIRECTIONS. THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH IN SOME ISSUES WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE AXIOLOGICAL (IDEOLOGICAL) APPROACH. EMPIRICAL METHODS SUCH AS OBSERVATION, DESCRIPTION, COMPARISON, INDUCTIVE GENERALIZATION WERE USED TO IDENTIFY TENDENCIES OF REFORMING THE SYSTEM OF SUBJECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF UKRAINE. LOGICAL-SEMANTIC METHOD WAS USED FOR FORMULATION AND IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS. THE DIALECTICAL METHOD OF COGNITION MADE IT POSSIBLE TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION". THE APPLICATION OF METHODS OF MODELING, ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, GENERALIZATION AND ANALOGY MADE IT POSSIBLE TO FORMULATE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS OF THE RESEARCH CORRELATE WITH THE DELINEATION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL COMPONENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN UKRAINE. THE AUTHORS HAVE MADE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CHANGES CONCERNING THE UPDATING OF THE SUBJECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE CONDITIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE AS A DEMOCRATIC AND RULE-OF-LAW STATE, ALL REFORM INITIATIVES SHOULD BE SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER, THEREFORE, DURING THE STUDY, THE FEATURES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ARE HIGHLIGHTED. THE SCIENTIFIC AND ANALYTICAL MONITORING OF THE STATE OF THE INTRODUCED CHANGES AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE IMPLEMENTED ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM MEASURES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WAS CARRIED OUT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC ASPECTS OF THE CONTENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BETTER AND CAN BE USED IN THE RESEARCH FIELD IN ORDER TO FURTHER STUDY THE ISSUE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES THAT GOVERNING SUBJECTS UNDER THE BACKGROUND OF ACTUALIZATION OF TRENDS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND HUMANIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES.
453	ARTICLE DRAWS FROM SEVERAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS SUCH AS CRITICAL RACE THEORY, LAW AND ECONOMICS, AND RULE OF LAW CONCEPTIONS TO ARGUE THAT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (FSOC) SHOULD FORMALLY RECOGNIZE RACISM AS A THREAT TO FINANCIAL STABILITY DUE TO ITS INTERCONNECTEDNESS WITH RECENT AND PROJECTED SYSTEMIC DISRUPTIONS. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY FIRST INTRODUCING A NOVEL MODEL CREATED BY THE AUTHOR THROUGH WHICH TO DISSECT THIS CLAIM. THIS "SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION MODEL" PROVIDES A THEORETICAL DEPICTION OF HOW RACISM DRIVES EVERY PHASE ALONG THE LIFE-CYCLE CONTINUUM OF A SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION.FIRST, WITH RESPECT TO THE MODEL'S "INTRODUCTION" PHASE, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT RACIST PRACTICES AND POLICIES INCENTIVIZE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTIONS. THESE PRACTICES AND POLICIES TRANSFORM BLACK COMMUNITIES (AND OTHER VULNERABLE AREAS) INTO IDEAL DUMPING GROUNDS FOR NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES PRODUCED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. FOR EXAMPLE, REDLINING AND RESTRICTIVE RACIAL COVENANTS MADE BLACK COMMUNITIES IDEAL TARGETS FOR SUBPRIME MORTGAGES DURING THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007-2009. RACISM THEN LEADS TO "BLIND SPOTS" WHERE MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAGNIFY THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FLOWING FROM SUCH NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES WHILE UNDERESTIMATING ITS RESULTING COSTS.SECOND, DURING ITS "GROWTH" PHASE, THESE BLIND SPOTS CAUSE THE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION TO EXPAND EXPONENTIALLY SINCE MARKET PARTICIPANTS CREATE ADDITIONAL AVENUES FOR EXCLUSIVE COMMODIFICATION. DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007-2009, FOR INSTANCE, SUBPRIME MORTGAGES WERE REPACKAGED INTO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND SOLD TO ELITE COUNTERPARTIES ACROSS THE GLOBE. RELYING ON THE QUINTESSENTIAL FREE MARKET TO RESOLVE THESE HARMS HAS THEREFORE PROVEN INADEQUATE. THIRD, WHEN THE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION REACHES ITS "MATURITY" PHASE, THE DISPARATE HARMS EXPERIENCED BY BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SPILL OVER INTO THE MASSES. THE EXCESSIVE LEVERAGE PUMPED INTO THE MARKET DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS LED TO THE CASCADING FAILURES AND LOSSES THAT SPREAD TO EVERY CORNER OF THE MARKET.BASED ON THIS NOVEL SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION MODEL, THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE ARGUES THAT PROFESSOR DERRICK BELL'S INTEREST-CONVERGENCE THEORY FIRMLY TAKES ROOT WITHIN THIS MATURITY PHASE SINCE THIS SPILLOVER EFFECT IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR MEANINGFUL REGULATORY INTERVENTION. RACISM, HOWEVER, CAN EXTEND THE DEPTH AND DURATION OF THIS MATURITY PHASE GIVEN THE TENDENCY OF LAWMAKERS TO GRANT SELECTIVE RELIEF FOR ELITE CLASSES. AS THE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION GOES INTO ITS FOURTH AND LAST PHASE OF "DECLINE," RACISM CAUSES LAWMAKERS TO UNDERESTIMATE THE LONG-TERM COSTS ACCRUING TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES, WHICH CREATES A FERTILE BREEDING GROUND FOR FUTURE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTIONS. THIS ARTICLE APPLIES THIS SAME ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK IN ASSESSING HOW THE SYSTEMIC DISRUPTION GENERATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE IS SIMILARLY CONNECTED TO RACISM.A FORMAL RECOGNITION BY FSOC THAT RECOGNIZES RACISM AS A THREAT TO FINANCIAL STABILITY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT THIS DEEPLY TROUBLING CYCLE. SUCH A DESIGNATION WOULD FIRST CONCEDE THE LIMITATIONS OF PREEXISTING PROTECTIONS THAT ARISE UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW, AS WELL AS PRIVATELY ORDERED RESPONSES, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD FOR MORE INCLUSIVE RULEMAKING GOING FORWARD. IT COULD FURTHER SERVE AS A FRAMEWORK FOR FORMALIZING DATA COLLECTION MECHANISMS, COORDINATION ACROSS REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND EXPERTISE BUILDING WITHIN EVERY CORNER OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. FINALLY, AN FSOC DESIGNATION COULD SPUR INVESTORS, ASSET MANAGERS, STAKEHOLDERS, AND NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVOCATE FOR MEANINGFUL REFORM, WHILE STIMULATING INTEGRAL RULEMAKING FROM APPLICABLE REGULATORY AGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS COULD BE A VITAL STEP IN PROMPTING THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) TO PROMULGATE RULES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ITS ONGOING COMMITMENT TO STREAMLINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) METRICS UTILIZED BY ITS REGISTRANTS. MANDATORY RACIAL-EQUITY DISCLOSURES IMPLEMENTED BY THE SEC COULD ASSIST IN WEEDING OUT SYSTEMICALLY RACIST PRACTICES THAT COMPROMISE INVESTOR PROTECTION, WHILE INCREASING COMPETITION AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
454	THE DAILY "NEUES DEUTSCHLAND" OF 29 NOVEMBER 2002 QUOTED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT OF THE DUTCH SCIENTIST CHRISTIAAN FREDERIK RUTER: "ONE MUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE PROSECUTION OF NATIONAL SOCIALIST CRIMES IN EASTERN GERMANY - CONTRARY TO WESTERN GERMANY -RESULTED NOT ONLY FROM POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, BUT ALSO FROM A REAL, SINCERE NEED". RUTER WAS THE JUDGE OF THE NATIONAL COURT IN AMSTERDAM, AND UNTIL 2003 WAS ACTIVE AS PROFESSOR OF PROCEDURAL AND PENAL LAW AT THE AMSTERDAM UNIVERSITY. HE CONDUCTED THE PROJECT THE JUDICIARY AND NATIONAL SOCIALIST CRIMES. AS PART OF THE PROJECT, MATERIALS FROM PENAL PROCESSES THAT TOOK PLACE IN BOTH PARTS OF GERMANY AFTER 1945 WERE ANALYSED, DOCUMENTED AND PUBLISHED. THE WORKS ON THIS PROJECT WERE COMMENCED IN THE 1960S. THE QUOTATION REVEALS A UNILATERAL, UNCRITICAL AND NON-DIVERSIFYING EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVI-TY OF THE GDR IN THIS AREA. THIS APPROACH IS ALSO PALPABLE IN THE INTRODUCTION AND COMMENTS TO THE COLLECTION OF EASTERN GERMAN COURT DECISIONS IN CASES OF NATIONAL SOCIALIST MURDERS (SEE: DDR-JUSTIZ UND NS-VERBRECHEN. SAMMLUNGOSTDEUTSCHER STRAFURTEILE WEGEN NATIONALSOZIALISTISCHER TTUNGSVERBRECHEN. VERFAHRENSREGISTER UND DOKUMENTENBAND, ED. C.F. RUTER, D.DE MILDT, MUNCHEN 2002). HISTORIAN FALCO WERKENTIN CRITICISED FOCUSING ON COURT DECISIONS AND IGNORING THE "CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY WERE PRODUCED" UNDER THE SED DICTATORSHIP. HE DREW ATTENTION TO THE TRIALS AGAINST " NAZI AND WAR CRIMINALS" THAT WERE PENDING BEFORE THE PENAL CHAMBER IN WALDHEIM IN SPRING 1950. THESE PROCESSES RESULTED IN THE SENTENCING OF APPROX. 3,400 PERSONS FOR ALLEGEDLY OR ACTUALLY COMMITTED CRIMES, BUT THE JUDGEMENTS WERE PASSED IN VIOLATION OF THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW WERKENTIN UNDERLINED: "IN THE PROCEEDINGS HELD IN THE 1970S AND 1980S, OFFENCES WERE NOT FABRICATED ANY MORE. IN THOSE YEARS, ONE SHOULD ADOPT A CRITICAL APPROACH TO THOSE CASES THAT WERE NOT BROUGHT TO ACCUSATION. THIS ALSO CONCERNS [...] THE FRG IN THIS WHOLE PERIOD" (SEE: F. WERKENTIN, DDR-JUSTIZ UND NS-VERBRECHEN. NOTWENDIGE HINWEISE ZU EINER DOKUMENTATION [IN:] DEUTSCHLAND ARCHIV (DA) 3/2005, P. 506-515). RUTER DID NOT COMMENT ON THESE ARGUMENTS IN THE ARTICLE IN WHICH HE COMPARED THE NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS BETWEEN EASTERN AND WESTERN GERMANY SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE SENTENCES. AS A RESULT, HE ASCRIBED MORE CONVICTIONS TO THE GDR AND ITS JUDICIAL SYSTEM. HE ALSO CONCLUDED THAT CASES WERE CONDUCTED FASTER IN THE GDR. RUTER ALSO STATED THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE THESIS THAT THE STASI PROTECTED NAZI PERPETRATORS PRIOR TO PROSECUTION AND USED THEM WHENEVER AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED TO INFRINGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL IMAGE OF THE FRG (SEE: C. F. RUTER, DAS GLEICHE. ABER ANDERS. DIE STRAFVERFOLGUNG VON NS-VERBRECHEN IM DEUTSCH-DEUTSCHEN VERGLEICH [IN:] DA 2/2010, P. 213-222). IN THE BOOK TITLED ZBRODNIARZE NAZISTOWSCY I STASI. TAJNA POLITYKA WOBEC PRZESZLOSCI (NAZI AND STASI CRIMINALS. THE COVERT POLICY ON THE PAST), I MADE IT EVIDENT THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. SOMEWHAT AS A CONFIRMATION OF MY ARGUMENTS, THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL UNIT IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROSECUTING NATIONAL SOCIALIST MASS CRIMES COMMENCED PROCEEDINGS AGAINST AN SS-MAN SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACRE IN THE FRENCH LOCALITY OF ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE. THE SECURITY SERVICE HAD HELD INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PERSON'S POSSIBLE PARTICIPATION IN THE CRIME SINCE 1980, HOWEVER, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE JUDICIARY, IT RESIGNED FROM LAUNCHING PENAL PROCEEDINGS. THE ABOVE ARTICLE IS A POLEMIC WITH THE THESES OF R. RUTER.
455	THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES MAIN TRENDS, ISSUES, DEBATES, ACTORS AND INITIATIVES REGARDING RECOGNITION AND EXTENSION OF PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS. ITS PREMISE IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND UNIVERSAL NOTIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOUNDATIONS FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SOCIAL PEACE. EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT VIOLATIONS OF MIGRANTS' HUMAN RIGHTS ARE SO WIDESPREAD AND COMMONPLACE THAT THEY ARE A DEFINING FEATURE OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION TODAY. ABOUT 150 MILLION PERSONS LIVE OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTRIES; IN MANY STATES, LEGAL APPLICATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS TO NON-CITIZENS IS INADEQUATE OR SERIOUSLY DEFICIENT, ESPECIALLY REGARDING IRREGULAR MIGRANTS. EXTENSIVE HOSTILITY AGAINST, ABUSE OF AND VIOLENCE TOWARDS MIGRANTS AND OTHER NON-NATIONALS HAS BECOME MUCH MORE VISIBLE WORLDWIDE IN RECENT YEARS. RESEARCH, DOCUMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE CHARACTER AND EXTENT OF PROBLEMS AND OF EFFECTIVE REMEDIES REMAIN MINIMAL. RESISTANCE TO RECOGNITION OF MIGRANTS' RIGHTS IS BOUND UP IN EXPLOITATION OF MIGRANTS IN MARGINAL, LOW STATUS, INADEQUATELY REGULATED OR ILLEGAL SECTORS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. UNAUTHORIZED MIGRANTS ARE OFTEN TREATED AS A RESERVE OF FLEXIBLE LABOUR, OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF LABOUR SAFETY, HEALTH, MINIMUM WAGE AND OTHER STANDARDS, AND EASILY DEPORTABLE. EVIDENCE ON GLOBALIZATION POINTS TO WORSENING MIGRATION PRESSURES IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. PROCESSES INTEGRAL TO GLOBALIZATION HAVE INTENSIFIED DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS OF MODERNIZATION AND CAPITALIST DEVELOPMENT, CONTRIBUTING TO ECONOMIC INSECURITY AND DISPLACEMENT FOR MANY. EXTENSION OF PRINCIPLES IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS CULMINATED IN THE 1990 INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF ALL MIGRANT WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES. WITH LITTLE ATTENTION, PROGRESS IN RATIFICATIONS WAS VERY SLOW UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN REVIVED ATTENTION; ENTRY INTO FORCE IS LIKELY IN 2001. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS NOTES THAT ILO MIGRANT WORKER CONVENTIONS HAVE GENERALLY ACHIEVED OBJECTIVES BUT STATES HAVE RESISTED ADOPTION OF ANY STANDARDS ON TREATMENT OF NON-NATIONALS. A COUNTER-OFFENSIVE AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS AS UNIVERSAL, INDIVISIBLE AND INALIENABLE UNDERLIES RESISTANCE TO EXTENSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION TO MIGRANTS. A PARALLEL TREND IS DELIBERATE ASSOCIATION OF MIGRATION AND MIGRANTS WITH CRIMINALITY. TRAFFICKING HAS EMERGED AS A GLOBAL THEME CONTEXTUALIZING MIGRATION IN A FRAMEWORK OF COMBATTING ORGANIZED CRIME AND CRIMINALITY, SUBORDINATING HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTIONS TO CONTROL AND ANTI-CRIME MEASURES. INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION ON MIGRATION "MANAGEMENT" IS EXPANDING RAPIDLY, WITH FUNCTIONING REGIONAL INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONSULTATIVE PROCESSES IN ALL REGIONS, GENERALLY FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING INTER-STATE COOPERATION IN CONTROLLING AND PREVENTING IRREGULAR MIGRATION THROUGH IMPROVED BORDER CONTROLS, INFORMATION SHARING, RETURN AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES. EFFORTS TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS AND COMBAT XENOPHOBIA REMAIN FRAGMENTED, LIMITED IN IMPACT AND STARVED OF RESOURCES. NONETHELESS, NGOS IN ALL REGIONS PROVIDE ORIENTATION, SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE TO MIGRANTS, PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ADVOCATING RESPECT FOR MIGRANTS RIGHTS AND DIGNITY. SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES NOW HIGHLIGHT MIGRANT PROTECTION CONCERNS, NOTABLY THE UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON HUMAN RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS, THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN PROMOTING THE 1990 UN CONVENTION, UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY PROCLAMATION OF INTERNATIONAL MIGRANTS DAY, THE 2001 WORLD CONFERENCE AGAINST RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA, ANTI-DISCRIMINATION ACTIVITY BY ILO, AND TRAINING BY IOM. SUGGESTIONS TO GOVERNMENTS EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO DEFINE COMPREHENSIVE, COORDINATED MIGRATION POLICY AND PRACTICE BASED ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT CONCERNS RATHER THAN REACTIVE CONTROL MEASURES TO ENSURE BENEFICIAL MIGRATION, SOCIAL HARMONY, AND DIGNIFIED TREATMENT OF NATIONALS AND NON-NATIONALS. NGOS, BUSINESSES, TRADE UNIONS, AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS ARE URGED TO ADVOCATE RESPECT FOR INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, PROFESSIONALIZE SEN ICES AND CAPACITIES, TAKE LEADERSHIP IN OPPOSING XENOPHOBIC BEHAVIOUR, AND JOIN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES. NEED FOR INCREASED ATTENTION TO MIGRANTS RIGHTS INITIATIVES AND INTER-AGENCY COOPERATION BY INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IS ALSO NOTED.
456	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF THE ESSENCE AND CONTENT OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES IN THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF UKRAINE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REFORM. ATTENTION FOCUSES ON THE ISSUE OF A DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE SPHERE OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT A QUALITATIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL UPDATE OF THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL BASIS SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REFORM. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE CATEGORICAL FRAMEWORK, THE INTRODUCTION INTO THE LEGAL CIRCULATION OF NEW CATEGORIES, CAPABLE OF CREATING A MORE SOLID SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, IS PROVED. THE POSITIONS OF LEADING UKRAINIAN SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ON THE ESSENCE OF THE CATEGORY "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION" ARE ANALYSED AND THE REASONS FOR THE DUALISM OF APPROACHES TO ITS DEFINITION IN THE UKRAINIAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL DOCTRINE ARE REVEALED. ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE BASIC FACTORS OF THE SHIFT OF THE IDEA OF THE PRIORITY OF THE RULE OF LAW TOWARDS THE SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES AND INDIVIDUALS. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE STUDY IS THE TRADITIONS AND INNOVATIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF UKRAINE IN TERMS OF REFORM. THE PURPOSE IS TO STUDY THE NATURE AND CONTENT OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF UKRAINE AT THE PRESENT STAGE. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY WAS THE SET OF METHODS AND TECHNIQUES OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE. THE METHODOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION IS BASED ON A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS THAT DEFINED ITS DIRECTIONS. THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IN SOME ISSUES WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY AN AXIOLOGICAL (IDEOLOGICAL) APPROACH. EMPIRICAL METHODS SUCH AS OBSERVATION, DESCRIPTION, COMPARISON, AND INDUCTIVE GENERALIZATION WERE USED TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN THE REFORM OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF UKRAINE.THE LOGICAL AND SEMANTIC METHOD WAS USED FOR FORMULATION AND IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. THE DIALECTICAL METHOD OF COGNITION MADE IT POSSIBLE TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT OF "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION" IN UKRAINIAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL DOCTRINE. APPLICATION OF METHODS OF MODELLING, ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, GENERALIZATION, AND ANALOGY ALLOWED FORMULATING THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS STUDY ARE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ESTABLISHED THAT AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL REFORM OF UKRAINE SHOULD BE A QUALITATIVE AND SUBSTANTIAL UPDATING OF THE CATEGORICAL AND TERMINOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE FIELD OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND, ABOVE ALL, THE BASIC CATEGORY OF "PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION". AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE CONTEXT OF UKRAINE'S DEVELOPMENT AS A DEMOCRATIC AND LEGAL STATE, ALL REFORM INITIATIVES MUST BE SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT. SPECIAL ATTENTION ALSO NEEDS TO BE PAID TO SCIENTIFIC AND ANALYTICAL MONITORING OF THE STATE OF INTRODUCED CHANGES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE IMPLEMENTED ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM MEASURES, WHICH WILL ALLOW EXPEDITIOUSLY IDENTIFYING AND CORRECTING POSSIBLE MISTAKES, AS WELL AS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON FURTHER PROSPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL SECTOR. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WILL HELP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BASIC ASPECTS OF THE NEW CONCEPT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND CAN BE USED IN THE RESEARCH FIELD FOR A FURTHER IN-DEPTH STUDY OF THE ISSUE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL FIELD.
457	THE SUBJECT. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE PHENOMENON OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. IT EMPHASIZES THAT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORONAVIRUS INFECTION WAS AVAILABLE SEVERAL DECADES AGO. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SPECIALISTS UNFORTUNATELY WEREN'T READY FOR THE POSSIBLE MUTATION OF THIS VIRUS, WHICH HAS NOW EXPOSED A LARGE-SCALES THREAT TO THE POPULATION OF THE WHOLE WORLD. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND OFFER PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING THE RUSSIAN AND BELARUSIAN LEGISLATION AND THE PRACTICE OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FIELD OF COMBATING THE CORONAVIRUS INFECTION. THE METHODOLOGY. THE AUTHORS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE PRACTICE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL BODIES OF RUSSIA AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES. THEY MAKE A CONCLUSION ON THE LEGITIMACY AND NECESSITY OF THE TAKEN RESTRICTIVE MEASURES. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON THE DIALECTICAL METHOD, AS WELL AS AT THE LOGICAL, HISTORICAL, SYSTEMIC METHODS. METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS WERE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE. THE AUTHORS HAVE APPLIED THE FUNCTIONAL METHOD TO RESEARCH THE MAIN AREAS FOR ENSURING A REASONABLE BALANCE OF PRIVATE (INDIVIDUAL) AND PUBLIC INTERESTS. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. MODERN CONSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN AND THE BELARUSIAN ONES, CONTAINS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, ENSHRINE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS AS THE HIGHEST VALUE. HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS CONTINUE TO BE ARE AT THE EPICENTER OF MANY DISPUTES AND DISCUSSIONS. THE MODERN SYSTEM OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IS CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING; THE LEGAL STATUS OF A PERSON RECEIVES NEW CONTENT AS THE HUMAN CIVILIZATION DEVELOPS AND THE PARADIGM OF VALUES CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SEE HOW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ADVANCES AFFECT THE SCOPE OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE INTERCONNECTED AND INTERDEPENDENT. ALL GROUPS OF RIGHTS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE FIELD OF VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE PROBLEM OF EQUALITY, THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION, THE RESTORATION OF VIOLATED RIGHTS, THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIMITS OF THE STATE'S INVASION IN HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS CONTINUES TO BE RELEVANT NOWADAYS. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE POSSIBLE RESTRICTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION. THE INTERNATIONAL LAW RULES ON HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGE STATES TO TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT HEALTH AND PROVIDE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE IN NEED. CONCLUSIONS. ONE OF THE CONSTANT PROBLEMS IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF A PARTICULAR PERSON AND THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PERSONS, GROUP OR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC FORCED THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF THE PRIORITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROTECTION OF THE LIFE AND HEALTH OF CITIZENS. THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS THE FACTOR THAT AFFECTS THE CONTENT OF THE LEGAL REGULATION OF RELATIONS IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE AFFECT THE RIGHT TO HEALTH PROTECTION, FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION, RIGHT TO HAVE SPORT ACTIVITY, RIGHT TO WORK, FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND OTHERS. THE ARTICLE PROPOSES TO INFORM THE POPULATION MORE FULLY ABOUT THE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE AND SOCIETY IN THIS DIRECTION, ABOUT THE WIDER USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, ABOUT THE POSSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND THE SELF-ISOLATION REGIME.
458	THE SUBJECT. ANY LEGAL ORDER IS BASED ON A STRICT HIERARCHY OF NORMATIVE ACTS, BUILT ACCORDING TO THEIR LEGAL FORCE. THIS HIERARCHY HAS BEEN ENSURED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXERCISING JUDICIAL REVIEW. IN RUSSIA, A NORMATIVE ACT CAN BE CHALLENGED ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT CONTRADICTS LAWS OF GREATER LEGAL FORCE, EXCEPT FOR THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION, IN THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED FOR IN CHAPTER 21 OF THE RUSSIAN CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. IN DOING SO, ONE OF THE CRUCIAL QUESTIONS TO BE DECIDED IN THE COURSE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF NORMATIVE ACTS IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE MOMENT WHEN A NORMATIVE ACT CONTRADICTING A NORMATIVE ACT OF GREATER LEGAL FORCE CEASES TO BE VALID. THIS TEMPORAL ASPECT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DETERMINES WHETHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTS (ACTS INVOLVING APPLICATION OF THE LAW) BASED ON A NULL AND VOID LAW ARE ENTITLED TO SEEK JUDICIAL RELIEF. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE PERMISSIBILITY OF A SITUATION IN WHICH UNLAWFUL NORMATIVE ACT REMAINS VALID FOR A CERTAIN TIME. THE METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH INCLUDES FORMAL LEGAL ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE NORMS OF THE RUSSIAN CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, DECISIONS OF THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND OTHER COURTS. THE MAIN RESULTS, SCOPE OF APPLICATION. THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE CRITERIA USED BY RUSSIAN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO DETERMINE THE MOMENT FROM WHICH A NORMATIVE ACT BECOMES INVALID. THE STUDY SUMMARIZES ALL THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS AND ANALYZES HOW CORRECTLY COURTS JUSTIFY THEIR CHOICE OF A SPECIFIC TIMELINE AND WHETHER THEIR RULINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. HAVING CONSIDERED RECENT RUSSIAN CASE LAW, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THE CURRENT RULES FOR DETERMINING THE MOMENT OF DECLARING A LAW NULL AND VOID ARE UNSATISFACTORY SINCE THEY DO NOT PROVIDE CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS CRITERIA, GUIDED BY WHICH RUSSIAN COURTS COULD DETERMINE THE MOMENT A NORMATIVE ACT BECOMES INVALID. THE RUSSIAN CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS ONLY INDICATES THREE OPTIONS: A COURT MAY STRIKE DOWN A LAW FROM THE DATE OF ITS ADOPTION, FROM THE DATE A JUDGMENT ENTERS INTO LEGAL FORCE, OR FROM ANOTHER DATE DETERMINED BY THE COURT. AS A RESULT, COURTS CAN RULE ON THE RETROACTIVITY OF THEIR JUDGMENTS IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE RISKS OF SELECTIVE JUSTICE AND ARBITRARY LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE. THE GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY THE PLENUM OF THE RUSSIAN SUPREME COURT IS OF LITTLE HELP BECAUSE WHILE OFFERING SOME CRITERIA, THEY CONTAIN ONLY DISPOSITIVE RULES, WHICH ONLY AGGRAVATES THE STATE OF UNCERTAINTY. THE STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT RUSSIAN COURTS TEND TO DECLARE A CHALLENGED LAW INVALID ONLY FOR THE FUTURE, EVEN THOUGH ITS DISQUALIFICATION FROM THE MOMENT OF ITS INTRODUCTION WOULD NOT UNDERMINE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, WOULD LEAD TO A FAIRER JUDGMENT, ALLOWING TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW AND RESTORE THE RIGHTS VIOLATED BY A NULL AND VOID LAW. CONCLUSIONS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT IN ANY CASE, NEW LEGAL RULES ANNOUNCED BY A COURT SHOULD HAVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT IF IT PROMOTES A LEGAL STATUS OF CITIZENS IN RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN STATE AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THIS APPROACH SHOULD BE TAKEN IN CASES CONCERNING SOCIAL GRANTS, PENSIONS, AND OTHER SOCIAL BENEFITS. THIS APPROACH CAN ALSO BE TAKEN IN CASES WHERE THE STATE IS A LOSING PARTY IN A CIVIL ACTION.
459	FURTHER CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY, MARKET AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON GRADUAL INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPHERES OF SOCIAL RELATIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE PECULIARITIES OF FUNCTIONING OF ENTERPRISES OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND FORMS OF OWNERSHIP. THE REGULATION OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT SHOULD BE BASED, FIRST OF ALL, ON AN INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH BY CREATING AN ADEQUATE SUPPORT MECHANISM AND STIMULATING ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO FORMULATE THE METHODOLOGICAL BASES FOR THE STUDY OF INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF MARKET ENVIRONMENT DISORTION ON THE BASIS OF PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS AND INSTITUTIONAL ENGINEERING.THE AUTHORS SUMMARIZE THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT HAS CERTAIN RULES OF BEHAVIOR FOR THE SUBJECTS OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM, WHICH REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS SYSTEM, AND ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF WELFARE OF MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT, BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL, THEY MUST PROMOTE THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF ECONOMIC PROCESSES AND REPRESENT SOCIAL VALUE AND PRODUCTIVE FORCE IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THEMSELVES, FORMING SUCH A RESOURCE OF SOCIETY AS SOCIAL CAPITAL, WHICH SUPPLEMENTS AND REGULATES THE USE OF PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL. THE AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL CAPITAL REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF TRANSACTION COSTS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE NUMBER OF SERVICES FOR MONITORING AND CONTROLLING THE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ECONOMIC PROCESS IT IS PROPOSED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH BASED ON PREDICTIVE MODELS OF FORECASTING MANNER, THAT IS USED TO PREDICT THE INCOME AND EXPENSES OF THE SUBJECT AND ITS FUTURE STATUS. THE OVERALL MACRO-FACTOR ANALYSIS OF MARKET DISTORTIONS HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS CARRIED OUT BY THE WORLD BANK, WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF INDICATORS: THE FIRST GROUP INCLUDES POLITICAL LIBERTIES AND POLITICAL STABILITY, THE SECOND ONE IS THE EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNANCE AND THE QUALITY OF REGULATORY ACTIVITY, AND THE THIRD ONE IS THE RULE-OF-LAW ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF COMPLIANCE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS, PROPERTY RIGHTS. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE DYNAMICS OF THE EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT IN THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT ALLOWED US TO CONSIDER INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES, BOTH THROUGH THE PRISM OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMIC AGENTS AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS OF INFLUENCE (THE PERFECTION OF RULES, TIME INTERVAL FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION, ETC.). ALSO, IT ALLOWED TO ANALYZE THE DISPARITIES IN THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TRAJECTORIES FORMED BY GRADUAL CHANGES AND TRAJECTORIES THAT HAVE CERTAIN "BREAKS", JUMPS OR "INSTITUTIONAL SHOCKS". THE AUTHORS PRESENT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESULTS OF A PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IT IS GENERALIZED THAT THE FINAL ASSESSMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. PRE-FORECASTING GIVES A PLAUSIBLE ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND A PREDICTABLE ESTIMATE OF CHREODITY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OPTION. IT ALSO PROPOSES THE INTRODUCTION OF INSTITUTIONAL ENGINEERING AS AN ACTIVITY AIMED AT DEVELOPING MODELS OF ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE CONSCIOUSLY AND PURPOSEFULLY INTRODUCED INTO THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND MASS ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR. THE MAIN PROBLEM LIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH RULES AND PRINCIPLES OF ACTIVITY, THE ADHERENCE OF WHICH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVE SOLUTION OF THOSE PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE CREATED.
460	EMPLOYERS AND PRACTICING LAWYERS FACE THE CHALLENGES OF DIGITALISATION IN SOCIETY. MANY LACK ENOUGH EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS TO WORK WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THEIR GRADUATES, UNIVERSITIES HAVE ESTABLISHED ADVANCED TRAINING PROGRAMMES RELATED TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND LAW; HOWEVER, A COMMON APPROACH HAS YET TO BE FOUND. THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR THE DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF LAWYERS WILL ASSIST IN SOLVING NOVEL PROBLEMS IN THE FIELD OF LEGAL EDUCATION. THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD INCLUDE GENERAL DIGITAL COMPETENCIES FOR ALL LEGAL PROFESSIONS. THE USE OF COMPUTER OR VIRTUAL SIMULATORS, DEMO VERSIONS OF POPULAR DIGITAL PLATFORMS, AND LEGALTECH HACKATHONS WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO IMPROVE THE DIGITAL SKILLS OF LAW STUDENTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW EXAMINING THE ESSENCE OF ONGOING PROCESSES AND BETTER ACQUIRE THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
461	THE AIM OF EVALUATING A REGULATORY SYSTEM IS TO ENABLE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY FUNCTION, REGULATE, AND PRIORITIZE ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL LITERATURES PROVIDE USEFUL PRINCIPLES WITH WHICH TO PROCEED. HOWEVER, OFF-THE-SHELF METHODS FOR ASSESSING REGULATORY SYSTEMS WITH GENERIC CHARACTERISTICS ARE SCARCE. THE REGULATORY SYSTEM SCAN AND ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY WAS DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND APPLIED TO THE CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT GOVERNS ISRAEL'S ACTIONS TO PLAN-MITIGATE, PREPARE, RESPOND, AND RECOVER-FROM THE DAMAGE WHICH MAY BE CAUSED BY A SEVERE EARTHQUAKE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS OFTENTIMES WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE EXISTENCE OF PROBLEMS IN A REGULATORY SYSTEM, THERE IS RARELY CONSENSUS OR A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE. ONLY WHEN PROBLEMS ARE IDENTIFIED CAN POLICY MAKERS CREATE VIABLE AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULATORY SYSTEM SCAN AND ASSESSMENT IS A STEP TOWARD ADDRESSING THIS CHALLENGE.
462	INSPECTION AND MONITORING BODIES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROTECTION OF PRISONERS' RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH THESE BODIES ARE SEEN AS WIDELY BENEFICIAL, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH EXAMINING THEIR OPERATIONS IN PRACTICE. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE BY IDENTIFYING UNIQUE PROFILES OF PRISONERS BASED ON THEIR FAMILIARITY WITH PRISON OVERSIGHT BODIES. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROFILES AND KEY FACTORS (PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, SENTENCE-RELATED VARIABLES AND THOSE RELATED TO LIFE IN PRISON) WAS EXAMINED USING MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION. PARTICIPANTS WERE 508 MALES RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THREE PRISONS IN IRELAND. DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2018 AND FEBRUARY 2019, USING SELF-ADMINISTERED SURVEYS. LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS REVEALED FOUR SUBGROUPS OF PRISONERS CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT PATTERNS OF AWARENESS AND CONTACT WITH PRISON OVERSIGHT BODIES: (1) LOW FAMILIARITY (44.1 PERCENT); (2) HIGH AWARENESS WITH LOW CONTACT (26.4 PERCENT); (3) HIGH FAMILIARITY WITH THE VISITING COMMITTEES BUT LOW WITH OTHER OVERSIGHT BODIES (14.2 PERCENT); AND (4) HIGH FAMILIARITY (15.4 PERCENT). NOTABLY, THE LARGEST GROUP WAS THE LOW FAMILIARITY GROUP, AND FEW PRISONERS BELONGED TO THE HIGH FAMILIARITY GROUP. NATIONALITY, SENTENCE LENGTH, CONFIDENCE IN STAFF AND COMPLAINT USAGE WERE LINKED TO CLASS MEMBERSHIP. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING AWARENESS OF INSPECTION AND MONITORING BODIES AMONG PRISONERS IN GENERAL, AND AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS IN PARTICULAR.
463	THE RECURRING CONTROVERSY OVER THE LIMITS OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IS TODAY INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE PHENOMENON OF DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL NETWORKS. WE THUS ADDRESS THIS PHENOMENON IN THE FIRST PLACE, ALONG WITH THE STRATEGIES DEPLOYED IN THE LAST DECADE TO FIGHT IT. THE CONTROVERSY IS THEN ANALYZED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE IT HAS GENERATED WORLDWIDE, WITH A MAIN FOCUS ON THE SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU. FINALLY, A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THIS RESPONSE FOLLOWS, ALONG WITH SOME FACTS AND REFLECTIONS REGARDING THE CURRENT POST-PANDEMIC SCENARIO.
464	WHILE LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORKS ARE BASED ON A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECURITY ACTORS AND FUNCTIONS, THE REALITY ON THE GROUND IN INDONESIA REVEALS THAT THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF CORPORATE CAPTURE OF PUBLIC SECURITY SERVICES, INCLUDING THE MILITARY AND POLICE, WHO OFTEN OPERATE ALONGSIDE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES (MAINLY LOCAL, THOUGH THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF AN EMERGING INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE), AND THE SECURITY PERSONNEL OF COMPANIES ENGAGED IN THE NATURAL RESOURCES INDUSTRY. THIS HAS LED TO SERIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND OTHER LOCAL INHABITANTS, WHO OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES ENTANGLED IN PROTRACTED CONFLICTS WITH MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES OVER ACCESS TO THEIR LAND. TWO CASE STUDIES INVOLVING FIELDWORK IN THE LOGGING AND PALM OIL SECTORS IN SUMATRA REVEAL A PERNICIOUS AND DELIBERATE EROSION AND VIOLATION OF RIGHTS OF LOCAL INHABITANTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF SECURITY ACTORS, SHOWING THAT PUBLIC SECURITY ACTORS ARE PROTECTING CORPORATE INTERESTS RATHER THAN PERFORMING PUBLIC FUNCTIONS. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES AS WELL AS ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE ARTICLE REASONS TOWARDS WHAT ARE ARGUED TO BE NECESSARY LEGAL AND POLICY CHANGES.
465	GENDER ALLEGEDLY INFLUENCES ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOUR. COMPARED TO THE VAST LITERATURE ON GENDER AND POLITICAL CULTURE, THE ROLE OF GENDER IN SHAPING LEGAL VALUES REMAINS UNDER-RESEARCHED. BASED ON DATA FROM A 2015 SURVEY IN HONG KONG, THIS STUDY FILLS A GAP BY ASCERTAINING THE GENDER EFFECT ON SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. IT FOUND THAT, DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MIGRANT STATUS, EDUCATION LEVEL AND OCCUPATION, GENDER ALONE PREDICTS SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. SECOND, ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, WOMEN ARE LESS SUPPORTIVE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THAN MEN. THIRD, HONG KONG-BORN MALE PROFESSIONALS WITH TERTIARY EDUCATION AND CHINA-BORN FEMALE MANUAL WORKERS WITH PRIMARY EDUCATION OR BELOW REGISTERED THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST DEGREE OF SUPPORT FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THE STEADY INFLOW OF MAINLAND CHINESE MIGRANTS AFTER THE CITY RETURNED TO CHINESE RULE IN 1997, MANY OF THEM WIVES OF HONG KONG HUSBANDS, THESE FINDINGS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY'S EVOLVING LEGAL CULTURE.
466	HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS PERPETRATED BY BUSINESS ENTERPRISES ARE A REALITY THAT HAS BEEN TOPIC OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS BODIES FOR CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME. OVER THE YEARS, PROPOSALS AND INSTRUMENTS OF VARIOUS CHARACTER WERE CONTEMPLATED TO REGULATE CORPORATE CONDUCT. ALL HAVE BEEN SUBJECT OF INTENSE SCRUTINY AND BECAME CONTENTIOUS POINTS BETWEEN STATES INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. THE ONLY DOCUMENT EVER ADOPTED BY CONSENSUS WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS WERE GUIDING PRINCIPLES ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, ADOPTED AS NON-BINDING RULES. HOWEVER, THE ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY NEVER CEASED AND ARE CURRENTLY DEBATED, WITH CONSIDERABLE PARTICIPATION OF THE EU. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPING FRAMEWORK OF BUSINESS RELATIONS TO HUMAN RIGHTS, CONSIDER THE EU INVOLVEMENT, AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE EU CAN FURTHER ADVANCE THE STANDARDS OF PROTECTION, ESPECIALLY WHETHER IT HAS COMPETENCE TO CONCLUDE THE POTENTIAL FUTURE AGREEMENT ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AND WHAT APPROACHES ARE FEASIBLE FOR THE EU TO IMPLEMENT SUCH AGREEMENT INTO ITS LEGAL ORDER.
467	THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN PRISON GIVES RISE TO UNIQUE CHALLENGES. THE POWER DIFFERENTIALS AND DYNAMICS INVOLVED, THE NEED TO BALANCE CONSIDERATIONS OF SECURITY WITH THOSE OF DIGNITY, AND THE LACK OF OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD MEAN THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES TAKES ON A PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN THESE ENVIRONMENTS. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW HAS INCREASINGLY EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF PRISONS AS A WAY TO PREVENT TORTURE AND ILL-TREATMENT AND TO UPHOLD FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MORE GENERALLY. ALTHOUGH THE MONITORING OF PRISONS IS NOW QUITE WELL ESTABLISHED AS A PRINCIPLE OF EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS PROVISIONS, WE KNOW SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE IN PRISON EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTAND MONITORING BODIES. THIS GAP IN OUR UNDERSTANDING IS PART OF A WIDER LACK OF LITERATURE ON HOW PRISONERS EXPERIENCE THEIR RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF THEIR RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THAT GAP A, REPORTING ON QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM A STUDY WITH PEOPLE IN PRISON IN IRELAND ON THEIR VIEWS AND PERCEPTIONS OF A MONITORING BODY: THE INSPECTOR OF PRISONS. THE ARTICLE FINDS EVIDENCE OF A LACK OF AWARENESS OF, AND A DEFICIT OF TRUST IN, MONITORING. HOWEVER, THIS PICTURE IS COMPLEX, WITH PEOPLE IN PRISON ALSO VIEWING THE CONCEPT OF MONITORING AS A GOOD WAY TO PROTECT RIGHTS, BELIEVING THAT THE VISIBILITY OF MONITORS, CLARITY IN THEIR ROLE AND POWERS, AND ENSURING THAT A VARIETY OF VOICES ARE HEARD BY MONITORING BODIES ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF A GOOD SYSTEM OF PRISON OVERSIGHT.
468	ON 20 JUNE 1792 POPULAR MILITANTS FROM THE PARIS SECTIONS MARCHED IN ARMS TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY WHERE THEY DEMANDED THAT THE DEPUTIES CONSTRAIN OR REMOVE THE KING. THE CROWDS THEN INVADED THE TUILERIES PALACE TO INTIMIDATE LOUIS XVI DIRECTLY. WHILE FORCED TO DON THE RED CAP OF THE SANS-CULOTTES, THE KING MADE NO CONCESSIONS TO THE DEMONSTRATORS. HISTORIANS OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION HAVE INTERPRETED THIS EPISODE AS A STEP TOWARD THE INSURRECTION OF 10 AUGUST 1792 WHICH OVERTHREW THE MONARCHY. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE JOURNEE OF 20 JUNE PROVOKED PROTESTS THROUGHOUT FRANCE, BOTH MARXISTS AND REVISIONISTS HAVE CONSTRUED THESE AS EXPRESSIONS OF ROYALISM AND MINIMIZED THEIR IMPORTANCE. YET THE PROVINCIAL REACTIONS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A MORE SUBTLE DIVISION IN THE COUNTRY AS THE REVOLUTION SHIFTED TO A MORE RADICAL PHASE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PETITIONS AND ADDRESSES THAT WERE SENT FROM THE DEPARTMENTS TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY TO PROTEST THE EVENTS OF 20 JUNE 1792 IN PARIS. WHILE THESE TEXTS DENOUNCED THE OUTRAGES COMMITTED AGAINST THE KING, THEY WENT BEYOND MANIFESTATIONS OF LOYALTY TO EXPRESS COMMITMENT TO THE IDEAL OF CONSTITUTIONALISM. SOME ADDRESSES REFLECTED LOCAL CONFLICT BETWEEN ADMINISTRATORS AND POPULAR REVOLUTIONARIES. NOT ALL PROTESTS AGAINST THE EVENTS IN PARIS WERE SENT BY WEALTHY BOURGEOISIE, HOWEVER, AND THE PETITIONS PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL DIVISION BEYOND CLASS CONFLICT. THE PROVINCIAL REACTIONS TO 20 JUNE 1792 SUGGEST THAT MANY IN FRANCE STILL HOPED TO DEFEND THE LIBERAL REVOLUTION WITH ITS PROMISE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO IDENTIFY NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY WITH THE DECISIONS OF AN ELECTED LEGISLATURE UNDER A CONSTITUTION RATHER THAN DIRECT MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR WILL, ON THE EVE OF A SECOND REVOLUTION, WHICH WOULD SWEEP AWAY THE CONSTITUTION OF 1791. LE 20 JUIN 1792, DES MILITANTS REVOLUTIONNAIRES ARMES PENETRENT DANS L'ASSEMBLEE LEGISLATIVE ET EXIGENT DES DEPUTES QU'ILS FASSENT PRESSION SUR LE ROI OU LE DETRONENT. ENSUITE, LA FOULE DE MANIFESTANTS SE DIRIGE VERS LE PALAIS DES TUILERIES QU'ELLE ENVAHIT AFIN D'INTIMIDER DIRECTEMENT LOUIS XVI. LES SANS-CULOTTES PARISIENS IMPOSENT AU MONARQUE DE SE COIFFER D'UN BONNET ROUGE, MAIS LE ROI, QUI NE SE LAISSE PAS IMPRESSIONNER, NE CONCEDE RIEN A LA FOULE. POUR LES HISTORIENS DE LA REVOLUTION FRANCAISE, CET EPISODE CONSTITUE UN PAS VERS L'INSURRECTION DU 10 AOUT 1792 QUI ALLAIT METTRE FIN A LA MONARCHIE. MEME S'ILS RECONNAISSENT QUE LA JOURNEE DU 20 JUIN A DONNE LIEU A DES MANIFESTATIONS PARTOUT EN FRANCE, LES MARXISTES ET LES REVISIONNISTES CONSIDERENT CES EVENEMENTS COMME ETANT UNE FORME D'EXPRESSION DU LOYALISME ET EN MINIMISENT L'IMPORTANCE. POURTANT, LES REACTIONS PROVINCIALES FOURNISSENT DES PREUVES D'UNE CLIVAGE PLUS SUBTIL DANS LE PAYS AU MOMENT OU LA REVOLUTION PASSAIT A UNE ETAPE PLUS RADICALE. LE PRESENT ARTICLE EXAMINE LES PETITIONS ET LES DISCOURS ENVOYES A L'ASSEMBLEE LEGISLATIVE, EN PROVENANCE DES DEPARTEMENTS, PROTESTANT CONTRE LES EVENEMENTS DU 20 JUIN 1792 A PARIS. TOUT EN DENONCANT LES OUTRAGES COMMIS A L'ENCONTRE DU ROI, CES TEXTES VONT AU-DELA DES MANIFESTATIONS DE LOYAUTE POUR EXPRIMER L'ATTACHEMENT A L'IDEAL DU CONSTITUTIONALISME. CERTAINS DISCOURS EXPRIMENT LE CONFLIT LOCAL ENTRE LES ADMINISTRATEURS ET LES REVOLUTIONNAIRES POPULAIRES. TOUS LES MESSAGES DE PROTESTATION CONTRE LES EVENEMENTS DE PARIS N'AVAIENT CEPENDANT PAS ETE EXCLUSIVEMENT ENVOYES PAR LA HAUTE BOURGEOISIE, ET LES PETITIONS FOURNISSENT DES PREUVES D'UN CLIVAGE POLITIQUE ET IDEOLOGIQUE QUI VA AU-DELA DE LA LUTTE DES CLASSES. LES REACTIONS PROVINCIALES AUX EVENEMENTS DU 20 JUIN 1792 SUGGERENT QUE BON NOMBRE DE PERSONNES EN FRANCE ESPERAIENT ENCORE DEFENDRE LA REVOLUTION LIBERALE AVEC SA PROMESSE DE LIBERTES INDIVIDUELLES, DE DROITS DE PROPRIETE, DE L'ETAT DE DROIT ET D'IDENTIFIER LA SOUVERAINETE NATIONALE AVEC LES DECISIONS CONCERNANT UNE LEGISLATURE ELUE REGIE PAR UNE CONSTITUTION, PLUTOT QUE DES MANIFESTATIONS DIRECTES DE LA VOLONTE POPULAIRE, A LA VEILLE D'UNE DEUXIEME REVOLUTION QUI BALAYERAIT LA CONSTITUTION DE 1791.
469	THE CURRENT ARTICLE STUDIES THE PROBLEM OF NATURAL OBLIGATIONS OF NON-CLAIMING ALEATORY CONTRACTS, PARTICULARLY CONTRACTS OF GAMING AND WAGERING. THE AUTHOR SUBSTANTIATES THE POSITION THAT THE ABSENCE OF CLAIM DEFENSE FOR GAMES AND BETTING IS NOT A GROUND TO DENY NATURAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THEM. THE ARTICLE FURTHER CORROBORATES THAT THE AUTHORIZATION AND ENFORCEABILITY OF PROTECTION ARE DIFFERENT LEGAL PHENOMENA AND FAILURE OF CATEGORICAL ASSERTIONS OF SOME SCIENTISTS WHO BELIEVE THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF INDIVIDUALS CAN BE REGULATED ONLY BY THE RULE OF LAW. A PERSON COULD BE FORCED TO ACT IN CERTAIN WAYS, NOT ONLY THROUGH STATE COERCION. NATURAL OBLIGATIONS ATTEST THAT ALSO INFORMAL SOCIAL SANCTIONS POSSESS WITH SUCH POWER THAT IN SEPERATE CASES HAVE MORE CONSTRAINT EFFECT THAN LEGAL SANCTIONS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS NATURAL OBLIGATIONS BASED IN USUAL RIGHT OF TAJIKS, AND ALSO NATURAL OBLIGATIONS APPEARING FROM GAMBLING, WHICH FEASIBILTY IS EFFECTIVE EVEN IN JURIDICAL PROTECTION ABSENCE. THE AUTHOR SEARCH AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IN HIS RESEARCH, WHY ALL TIMES THE PERFORMANCE OF DEBTOR'S OBLIGATIONS ON HAZARD WAS THE DEPT OF HONOUR AND CONSCIENCE EVEN THEN, WHEN AS A STAKE USED NOT ONLY ESTATE, BUT EVEN ALIVE PEOPLE. PLAYER COULD USE AS A STAKE HIS OWN WIFE, CHILDREN, SISTER, SLAVERS AND EVEN OWN PART OF HIS BODY. IN THE CASE OF LOSING THE PAYMENT OF DEPT THE ABSENCE OF JURIDICAL PROTECTION OF OBLIGATIONS FROM GAMBLINGS ENTIRELY DID NOT STOPPED. THE EXPLANATION OF THIS DO NOT TAKE DOWN BARELY TO FEARS AND SAVINGS OF DEPTOR ABOUT USING CRIMIAL METHOD OF DEPT PENALTY FROM CREDITOR SIDE. AT HISTORICAL LITERATURE DEVOTED TO HAZARD THEME, PARTICULARLY, IN CARD GAME THERE ARE MORE FACTS CONFIRMING THAT CARD DEPT WAS THE SUBJECT OF OBLIGATION PAYMENT NOT IN THE CASE WITH FEAR BEFORE THE CREDITOR, BUT BECAUSE ITS CANCELLATION CONSIDERRED AS AN INIQUE CRITERIA OF PERSONAL HONOR IN THE SOCIETY. THE AUTHOR SEARCH THE ANSWER THE MENTIONED QUESTION IN AROUND LEGAL SCIENCES AND COMES TO THE POINT THAT THE SENSE OF HONOUR SOCIALLY IS IN ITS ESSENCE. PRIMARILY, BEFORE TO HAVE THE MEANING OF MORAL INTERNAL REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICULAR PERSON, IT IS FORMED AS AN UNIVERSAL MORAL REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTION IN THE FOM OF SOCIAL NORMS IN THE SOCIETY. INDIVIDUAL ASSESSING CARD DEPT AS DEPT OF HONOUR-IT IS THE SOCIALPSYCHOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT FORMED BY SOCIAL NORM BY SOCIETYITSELF, AND LIFE ITSELF. SUCH ARRANGEMENT IS SUPPORTED BY INFORMAL SANCTIONS IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL CONVICTION AND CENSURE BEHAVIOUR DECLINING FROM EXPECTATION OF SOCIETY. INFORMAL SANCTIONS HERE PLAY FUNCTIONAL ROLE, WHEREAS THEIR APPLICATIONS ENCOURAGE THE CONSCIOUSNESS CONFINE OF THAT, THAT IS JUSTIFIABLE AND ALLOWABLE BEHAVIOUR AND PERFORM THE ROLE OF FACTORS PROVOCATING PEOPLE TO CONFIRM ITS COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISHING SOCIAL DISCIPLINE. THE PURSUIT OF PERSON BELONGING TO THAT OR OTHER SOCIAL GROUP WILL DEVELOP ABILITY IN HIM TO ADAPT TO THIS SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. PERSON IS DISPOSED TO LEAD HIMSELF IN ACCORDANCE TO THE EXPECTATION OF SOCIETY, THEREFORE IN SEPERATE CASES SOCIAL IDEA CAN SERVE AS A MORE STRONG POINT IN HIS BEHAVIOUR THAN LEGAL NORMS. HERE WHY,-THE AUTHOR THINK,-THE ABSENCE OF DEPT SUPPORT IN THE GAME OF JURIDICAL PROTECTION IN MAJORITY IT IS NOT SEEN IN THEIR RETURN. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE SYSTEM OF OBLIGATIONS NOT CONFINED TO THE CLAIM, LIABILITIES, AND ALONG WITH THEM, THERE ARE ALSO OBLIGATIONS TO NON-CLAIMING PROTECTION. ALTHOUGH DUE TO THE LACK OF LEGAL PROTECTION THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF ALL OBLIGATIONS, THEY STILL HAVE THE FORCE OF OBLIGATION BECAUSE ENTAIL CERTAIN LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THESE IMPLICATIONS ARE THAT VOLUNTARILY PAID ON SUCH OBLIGATION CAN NOT BE DEMANDED BACK AS MONEY HAD AND RECEIVED. THIS ASSET DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO FILE A CLAIM, NOT ONLY THE LENDER, BUT ALSO THE DEBTOR, AS PROVIDED FOR FAILURE TO PROTECT OBLIGATIONS AS A WHOLE AND NOT ANY OF ITS ELEMENTS (ACTIVE OR PASSIVE).
470	ARTICULATION OF ISSUES. A NUMBER OF BASES, POSITIONS, WHICH PREVIOUSLY WERE RECOGNIZED AS THE ONLY CORRECT AND IRREFUTABLE, SERVED AS THE FOUNDATION OF LEGAL REGULATION OF CIVIL RELATIONS. BUT NOW THEY DO NOT FULLY CORRESPOND TO MODERN TENDENCIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL LAW SCIENCE. THAT IS WHY, TODAY, IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED ABOUT THE FORMATION OF A NEW DOCTRINE, WHICH CAN MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE-OF-LAW STATE. IN SUCH CONDITIONS, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE SCIENTIFIC AND THEORETICAL STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES TO THE ALLOCATION OF TYPES OF SERVITUDES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACCOUNTING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF CIVIL-LAW RELATIONS, TO THE FORMATION OF A CLEAR AND COHERENT SYSTEM. AT THE SAME TIME, THE VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC VIEWS ABOUT TYPES OF WAY-LEAVES CONSTANTLY ENCOURAGES THE IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE ISSUE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTRACTUAL, INHERITANCE, AND LAND RELATIONS FOR SERVITUDES BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. ALSO, ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION IS: ARE SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES TO ALLOCATION OF SERVITUDES ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC FEATURES FIXED IN LEGISLATION OR NOT? HAS THE LEGISLATOR STOPPED ONLY ON LAND AND PERSONAL SERVITUDE? THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE THEORETICAL AND LEGAL POSSIBILITIES AND APPROACHES TO THE ALLOCATION OF WAY-LEAVES ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC FEATURES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACCOUNTING AND JURISPRUDENCE. ALSO, ANOTHER AIM IS TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF LEGAL SCHOLARS TO POSSIBLE FURTHER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS PHENOMENON IN MODERN CIVIL LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES TO THE ALLOCATION OF TYPES OF SERVITUDES FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACCOUNTING. METHODOLOGY. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF LEGAL ACTS, WHICH ARE CONNECTED WITH LEGAL REGULATION OF WAY-LEAVE RELATIONS IN UKRAINE. ON THE BASIS OF THE COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD OF INVESTIGATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION, THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS OF THE USE OF TYPES OF SERVITUDES IN CONTRACTUAL HEREDITARY AND LAND RELATIONS ARE DETERMINED. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY HAVE SHOWN THAT SPECIAL APPROACHES TO THE ALLOCATION OF WAY-LEAVES ON THE BASIS OF SPECIFIC FEATURES IN UKRAINE ARE IN A REAL LEGAL VACUUM. SUCH A CONCLUSION IS BASED ON THE LACK OF LEGISLATIVE CLARIFICATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF OTHER TYPES OF SERVITUDES, WHICH ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE MATERIAL COMPONENT. THUS, PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THE TAX CODE OF UKRAINE ARE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE CIVIL CODE OF UKRAINE CONSOLIDATE THE MATERIAL CONSTITUENT OF REAL RIGHTS TO SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ACCOUNTING, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF INTANGIBLE SERVITUDES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTING OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IF THIS GAP WILL BE SOLVED, THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE REVISION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WAY-LEAVES, RELYING ON THE POSITIONS OF OTHER BRANCHES OF LAW. PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS OF INTANGIBLE SERVITUDE ARE CONTAINED IN NATIONAL LAW IS RATHER NECESSARY AND EXPEDIENT. SO, WE CAN TALK ABOUT CORPORATE RIGHTS AS A PERSON'S RIGHTS, THE SHARE OF WHICH IS DETERMINED IN THE STATUTORY FUND (PROPERTY) OF A BUSINESS ORGANIZATION. THESE RIGHTS INCLUDE THE COMPETENCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A BUSINESS ENTITY, OBTAINING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS (DIVIDENDS) OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND ASSETS IN CASE OF LIQUIDATION OF IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, AS WELL AS OTHER POWERS PROVIDED BY LAW AND STATUTORY DOCUMENTS AND, FOR EXAMPLE, THE RIGHTS TO USE WEBSITES, OR ASPECTS OF COMMERCIAL SECRECY. CORRELATION/ORIGINALITY. AN ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBLE USE OF OTHER TYPES OF WAY-LEAVES THAN THOSE, WHICH ARE ENSHRINED IN CIVIL LAW IN CONTRACTUAL, INHERITANCE, LAND RELATIONS CAN BECOME THE BASIS FOR DEVELOPING THE MOST PROMISING DIRECTIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC CIVIL LAW IN THIS AREA AND IMPROVING THE CIVIL LAW DOCTRINE.
471	ACCORDING TO THE HEADNOTE ATTACHED TO THE MOST RECENT DECISION UNDER DISCUSSION, THE LITIGATION TURNED ON THE QUANTIFICATION OF THE TOTAL LOSS SUFFERED BY M AS ALLEGED HOLDER OF A RIGHT OF HABITATIO AFTER S AS REPUTED OWNER OF THE FARM REVOKED THE VERBAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES ENTITLING M TO OCCUPY THE DWELLING ON CONDITION THAT HE RENOVATES THE DWELLING TO A HABITABLE STATE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONVICTION OF THE JUDGES INVOLVED, IT IS CLEAR THAT AT NO STAGE WERE ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OR VESTING OF A LIMITED REAL RIGHT OF HABITATIO COMPLIED WITH. NO LIMITED REAL RIGHT WAS REGISTERED AGAINST THE FARM AND S AS THE ALLEGED GRANTOR OF THE LIMITED REAL RIGHT WAS AT NO STAGE THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY. HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO BURDEN THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER WITH SUCH LIMITED REAL RIGHT. A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, HOWEVER, DID EXIST GRANTING THE CLAIMANT AN ENTITLEMENT TO OCCUPY THE DWELLING. THE INITIALLY FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN THE LITIGANTS SOURED ABRUPTLY IN FEBRUARY 2013 WHEN S EVICTED M FROM THE FARM BECAUSE OF A SUPPOSED BLASPHEMOUS COMMENT BY M. THIS HAPPENED AFTER THE CLAIMANT HAD ALREADY INVESTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE RESTORATION AND MODERNISATION OF THE OLD DILAPIDATED DWELLING. "THE PLAINTIFF REGARDED THIS AS A REPUDIATION OF THE CONTRACT BETWEEN HIM AND THE DEFENDANT, ACCEPTED IT AS SUCH AND LEFT THE FARM, EFFECTIVELY HALTING THE RENOVATION PROJECT" (PAR 14 READ WITH PAR 5.4 OF THE 2016-DECISION). HIS CLAIM FOR COMPENSATION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED WAS HELD BY THE COURT TO BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE RECEIPTS REPRESENTING THE COST OF BUILDING MATERIAL WHEN IT WAS ACQUIRED. IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE COURT SHOULD ALSO HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF THE LOSS SUFFERED AS POSITIVE INTEREST, BECAUSE THE CLAIMANT FORFEITED THE CALCULATED BENEFIT OF LIFE LONG FREE OCCUPATION IN THE RESTORED DWELLING. BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO THE LITIGATION, THE PATRIMONIAL BENEFIT THAT ACCRUED TO THE ESTATE OF THE OWNER OF THE FARM DUE TO THE OBJECTIVE RULES OF ACCESSIO CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED AS ACTIONABLE UNJUSTIFIED ENRICHMENT. THE PRINCIPLES OF UNJUSTIFIED ENRICHMENT DO NOT APPLY - THE RESULTING DETRIMENT OR LOSS OF M WAS CUM CAUSA AND NOT SINE CAUSA. THE REMARKS OF THE COURT POINTING TO UNJUSTIFIED ENRICHMENT DO NOT CONVINCE. DAMAGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALCULATED TO COVER THE LOSS IN POSITIVE INTEREST OF THE CLAIMANT AND NOT MERELY HIS NEGATIVE INTEREST, IE THE AMOUNTS PAID FOR THE BUILDING MATERIAL USED IN THE RENOVATION. THE COURT, HOWEVER, HELD: "I'M SATISFIED THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAS ADDUCED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE HIS CLAIM FOR THE COSTS OF RENOVATING THE FARMHOUSE ON A BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES" (PAR 23). THE LAST MENTIONED MODE OF QUANTIFICATION OF THE LOSS SUFFERED WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE IN PLACE WHERE MERELY A DELICT WAS INVOLVED, AS EG WHERE THE DAMAGED MOTOR VEHICLE SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO THE STATE IT WAS IN BEFORE THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. HAD THE JUDGES IN THIS CASE DONE A CORRECT ASSESSMENT OF LOSS UPON CANCELLATION FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, IT WOULD HAVE LED TO A RESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE CLAIMANT. THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEARLY FORMULATED MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO: "THE SUFFERER BY SUCH A BREACH SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE POSITION HE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED HAD THE CONTRACT BEEN PERFORMED, SO FAR AS THAT CAN BE DONE BY THE PAYMENT OF MONEY, AND WITHOUT UNDUE HARDSHIP TO THE DEFAULTING PARTY ...

472	THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGES THAT STARTED IN THE REGION OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST EUROPE IN THE NINETIES OF THE LAST CENTURY CONSEQUENTLY TOOK PLACE IN THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA, WITHIN THE YUGOSLAV COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, FOLLOWED BY BIG CHANGES AND TURBULENCES. UNLIKE THE MOST OF MODERN EUROPEAN STATES, SERBIA, SINCE THE ADOPTION OF ITS CONSTITUTION OF 1990 THAT INTRODUCED THE NORMATIVE REFORMS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, UNTIL THE MODERN CONSTITUTION OF 2006, DWELT WITHIN THE THREE COMPLEX STATE-LEGAL STRUCTURES, WHILST AFTER THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE STATE UNION WITH MONTENEGRO IT CONTINUED TO FUNCTION AS A SOVEREIGN AND INDEPENDENT STATE. WHILE THE PENDING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REFORMS IN SERBIA FOLLOW THEIR WAY DETERMINED BY THE CONSTITUTION, THE STATE OF SERBIA FACES WITH THE STRUGGLE ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL FOR PRESERVING THE INDIVISIBILITY AND INTEGRITY OF ITS TERRITORY, DUE TO THE UNILATERAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF ITS PROVINCE KOSOVO AND METOHIJA. THAT STRUGGLE WAS GIVEN THE STATUS OF THE DISPUTE BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE HAGUE. CONTINUING ITS CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION, THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA ESTABLISHED ITS INTERNAL CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER BY THE CONSTITUTION OF 2006, BASED ON THE DEMOCRATIC FORMATIONS AND VALUES OF THE DEVELOPED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES: THE ORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY; THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS BASED ON MARKET ECONOMY, FREEDOM OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, INDEPENDENCE OF BUSINESS ENTITIES AND EQUALITY OF PRIVATE AND OTHER TYPES OF ASSETS; THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW IS GUARANTEED AND IS TO BE EXERCISED THROUGH FREE AND DIRECT ELECTIONS, CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF HUMAN RIGHTS, SEPARATION OF POWERS, INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL POWER AND OBEYING THE CONSTITUTION AND LAW BY ALL BRANCHES POWERS. THE RANGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF SERBIA, BEING AMONG THE WIDEST ONES CONTAINED IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THE MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES OR INTERNATIONAL LAW ACTS IN THIS AREA, IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE LEGAL ORDER OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA. BESIDES THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THE INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND PROTECTION. IN THIS REGARD, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS, INTRODUCED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA IN 1963. THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS THE GUARDIAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE GUARANTOR OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY IN THE COUNTRY VARIED THROUGH DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE SERBIAN SOCIETY, SHARING THE FATE OF ITS PHASES OF ASCENT, STAGNATION AND CRISIS. HOWEVER, THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THAT INSTITUTION CREATED THE EXPECTATIONS BOTH OF THE CITIZENS AND STATE AUTHORITIES THAT CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHALL GIVE ITS OPINION ON THE KEY SITUATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY THAT REQUIRED SUPREME LEGAL, POLITICALLY NEUTRAL AND FAIR RESOLUTION OF A PROBLEM. IMPORTANT AND DELICATE SOCIAL QUESTIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT, ENTAILING EFFICIENT PROTECTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC VALUES GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION. SOME OF THEM CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS AUTHENTIC, TRADITIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL DISPUTES THAT REQUIRE THE CASSATION OF THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM, WHILE THE OTHERS, TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT, WERE DEALING WITH THE ISSUES RELATED TO POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ITS FUNCTIONING IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE STATE, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF A WIDE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE PRACTICE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SHOWS THE VARIETY OF TOPICS THAT THE COURT DEALT WITH IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS, WHILE WE WILL MENTION JUST SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO: PROCESS OF THE CREATION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SEVERAL ACTS ISSUED DURING STATE OF EMERGENCY IN SERBIA, PROTECTION OF ELECTORAL LAW AND MANDATES OF REPRESENTATIVES, PROTECTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS, IN PARTICULAR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, PROTECTION OF SOME FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS ETC.
473	REPRESENTATIVE BODIES OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT UNITS OF MUNICIPALITIES AND TOWNS MUNICIPAL AND TOWN COUNCILS - ARE EMPOWERED, ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND A SERIES OF LAWS, TO MAKE BY-LAWS (STATUTES, DECISIONS, PHYSICAL PLANNING, BUDGET) WHICH REGULATE NUMEROUS ISSUES IMPORTANT FOR THE LOCAL UNIT AS WELL AS FOR THE EXERCISE AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND LEGAL INTERESTS OF NATURAL AND LEGAL PERSONS. MOST BY-LAWS ARE MADE WITHIN THE SELF-GOVERNING (BASIC) SCOPE OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT AND A SMALLER NUMBER OF THEM WITHIN THE DELEGATED SCOPE. PURSUANT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, PROCLAIMED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA (ART. 3), ALL BY-LAWS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW. THEREFORE, THE CROATIAN LEGAL SYSTEM PROVIDES FOR LEGAL PROCEDURES AND INSTRUMENTS BY WHICH THE PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY IS ENSURED. SUPERVISION OF BY-LAWS MADE BY REPRESENTATIVE BODIES OF MUNICIPALITIES AND TOWNS WITHIN THE SELF-GOVERNING SCOPE IS LIMITED, ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE EUROPEAN CHARTER OF LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT, ONLY TO THE QUESTION OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW, WHILE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS EXCLUSIVELY COMPETENT TO REVIEW AND MAKE DECISIONS ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF SUCH BY-LAWS AND ANNUL THEM OR ABOLISH THEM. NEVERTHELESS, ON THE BASIS OF THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT ACT, EXECUTIVE BODIES (LOCAL AND CENTRAL) HAVE JURISDICTION TO SUPERVISE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF BYLAWS AND SUSPEND THE APPLICATION OF A BY-LAW WHICH THEY CONSIDER TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR ILLEGAL AND POSSIBLY TAKE MEASURES. THE ARTICLE GIVES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE POWER OF THE MUNICIPAL HEAD EXECUTIVE OR MAYOR - AS THE HOLDER OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER IN THE MUNICIPALITY OR TOWN - TO SUSPEND THE BY-LAW OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY, TO REQUIRE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY TO RE-EXAMINE IT AS WELL AS TO FULFIL ITS DUTY OF INFORMING THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE BODY COMPETENT FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE ADOPTED BY-LAWS. THE AUTHOR EXAMINES - DE LEGE LATA AND DE LEGE FERENDA - THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD OFFICIAL OF THE COUNTY OFFICE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (ADMINISTRATIVE HEAD OFFICIAL AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL) AND CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE BODY COMPETENT FOR LOCAL AND REGIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT TO SUSPEND FROM IMPLEMENTATION BY-LAWS OF DOUBTFUL CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY. DEFICIENT PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS ON INSTITUTING AND CONDUCTING OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE CRITICISED, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY ARE INSTITUTED EXCLUSIVELY EX OFFICIO. THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WILL OR WILL NOT INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN ORDER TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF A SUSPENDED BY-LAW IS CRITICALLY ANALYSED, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SUCH A DECISION DEPENDS ON POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT. IF THE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTES PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, THEN THE DISPUTED BY-LAW IS NOT APPLIED UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT PROCEEDINGS. HOWEVER, IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT WITHIN A PERIOD OF 30 DAYS, THE DECISION ON SUSPENSION FROM APPLICATION CEASES TO HAVE EFFECT. THE AUTHOR ANALYSES THE LEGAL REGULATION AND UP-TO-DATE PRACTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO DISSOLVE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF A LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT UNIT DUE TO EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUS VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY BY ITS BY-LAWS (E.G. MAKING A DECISION WHICH THREATENS THE STATE SOVEREIGNTY OR TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY) OR FREQUENT UNLAWFUL DECISIONS OR FAILURE TO ADOPT CERTAIN BY-LAWS WITHIN PRESCRIBED TERMS (STATUTE, BUDGET, FINANCIAL PLAN) OR INCAPABILITY OF MAKING ANY DECISIONS DURING A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. FINALLY, THE AUTHOR CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION BY WHICH IN THE MATTER OF THE DELEGATED SCOPE, THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE POWER TO ABOLISH BUT NOT TO ANNUL A REPRESENTATIVE BODY'S BY-LAW.
474	THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE RURAL TERRITORIES AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE COUNTRY, WHICH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE CONFLICTING PROCESSES OF REFORMING THE ECONOMIC BASIS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHICH INCREASES THE UNCERTAINTY AND CAUSES THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL RISKS IN TERMS OF ORGANIZATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND OBTAINING THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF LABOR INCOME AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE CURRENT TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN RURAL AREAS, AMID THE PROCESSES OF DECENTRALIZATION OF THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, CREATE NEW CONDITIONS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS CONDUCIVE TO THE SUCCESSFUL ORGANIZATION OF RURAL RESIDENTS' LIVELIHOODS. THE URGENT TASK OF TODAY IS TO STUDY THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM OF THE EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL TERRITORIES, THE INSUFFICIENCY OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE COMPLEX TASKS OF REVITALIZATION OF RURAL TERRITORIES OF THEIR RESOURCE POTENTIAL IN THE CONTEXT OF INTRA-REGIONAL FEATURES OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR CARRYING OUT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TOPICS. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXPLORE WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY RURAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN NEGLECTED BY ECONOMIC SCIENCE, SINCE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY AND ITS REGIONS IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE SOCIAL REVIVAL OF THE VILLAGE. ALSO, A COMPREHENSIVE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL STUDY OF ISSUES OF MANAGEMENT AND STATE REGULATION OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT, IN PARTICULAR, THE SUBSTANTIATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UKRAINIAN VILLAGE, THE ISOLATION OF RURAL AREAS, THE FORMATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND ECONOMIC MECHANISM OF STATE SUPPORT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MODERN STATE AGRICULTURAL POLICY. METHODOLOGY. THE PROBLEMATIC OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POTENTIAL OF RURAL TERRITORIES IS BASED ON THE USE OF MULTIFACETED SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF KNOWLEDGE OF PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES. APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THE DYNAMICS AND TENDENCIES OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT, THE EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF AGRICULTURE, WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR THE STUDY OF PROBLEMS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL. ECONOMIC AND STATISTICAL RESEARCH IS BASED ON SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES, THEIR TOTALITY FORMS THE METHODOLOGY OF STATISTICS (METHODS OF MASS OBSERVATIONS, GROUPINGS, GENERALIZATIONS, TIME SERIES, INDEX METHOD, ETC.). RESULTS. IN THE CONDITIONS OF FORMATION OF MARKET RELATIONS IN RURAL AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN THE PERIOD OF ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRY, THE STUDY OF PRECONDITIONS FOR ENSURING BALANCED POTENTIAL OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE BASIS OF INTERNALLY ORIENTED MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS, JUSTIFICATION OF PRIORITY TYPES OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OF RURAL TERRITORIES OF THE REGION WITH OBSERVANCE OF ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS BECOMES EXTREMELY RELEVANT. ONE OF THE MAIN AREAS TO REFORM THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT MECHANISM IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL INITIATIVE. THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION IS TO USE THE METHOD OF DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY AS ONE WAY OF ESTABLISHING THE COMPETENCE OF LOCAL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DECENTRALIZATION OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER, AND IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR ALL PROCESSES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND, IN PARTICULAR, FOR IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. PUBLIC AUTHORITY. THE INSTITUTE OF DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY IN RURAL AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF A PROGRAMMATIC TARGETING METHOD IN THE BUDGETARY PROCESS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT WILL HELP TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY OF THE BUDGETARY PROCESS, WHICH WILL CLEARLY DEFINE THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH THE BUDGETARY RESOURCES OF THE REGION ARE SPENT, WHICH IN TURN WILL INCREASE THE LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THE RESULTS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF BUDGETARY PROGRAMS. THIS APPROACH WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF FISCAL POLICY-MAKING, THE EFFICIENCY OF DISTRIBUTION AND THE USE OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES IN RURAL AREAS. VALUE/ORIGINALITY. STATE POLICY IN UKRAINE ON REGULATING THE POTENTIAL OF LAND RELATIONS SHOULD BE AIMED AT SOLVING THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED IN RECENT YEARS AND TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL NEGATIVES OF LAND TRANSFORMATION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.
475	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE EFFECTS OF BOARD CAPITAL AS A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MECHANISM ON FIRM PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF A WEAK LEGAL REGIME FOR INVESTOR PROTECTION. THE STUDY FOCUSES ON LATIN AMERICA AS A REPRESENTATIVE EMERGING MARKET THAT INCLUDES A DATASET OF 442 FIRMS IN SIX COUNTRIES (ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHILE, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, AND PERU) FROM 2001 TO 2012. WE MEASURE BOARD CAPITAL AS A COMPOSITE INDEX OF DIRECTORS' EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE. WE FIND A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS BETWEEN BOARD CAPITAL AND FIRM PERFORMANCE WITHIN WEAK FIRM INTERNAL GOVERNANCE SCHEMES SUCH AS FIRMS WITH LOW BOARD INDEPENDENCE, DUAL ROLES AS FIRM CEOS AND COBS, AND LOW BLOCKHOLDER CONTESTABILITY. WITH RESPECT TO COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE STANDARDS, WE FIND THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S REGULATORY QUALITY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CORRUPTION CONTROL REDUCE THE NEED FOR FIRM BOARD CAPITAL AS AN INTERNAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISM.

476	CONSTITUENCIES ARE DE JURE APPORTIONMENT OF SPACE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ELECTING REPRESENTATIVES OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE. THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE BUT ALSO THEIR RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS OF TERRITORY, THE CONSTITUENCIES. THESE TWO - THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE - AND THE PREVAILING LAW OF THE COUNTRY PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES AND THEIR DELIMITATION. THE LAWS CONCERNING CONSTITUENCIES CAN HAVE TWO DIMENSIONS. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO THE LAWS OF ENFRANCHISEMENT AS TO WHO AMONG THE POPULATION HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THIS GIVES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ERECTORS AND THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES TO BE ELECTED. THE OTHER ASPECT OF CONSTITUENCIES IS THE ACTUAL DRAWING OF BOUNDARIES AND ENCLOSING PEOPLE WITHIN THE CONSTITUENCY FRAMEWORK. THIS IS INDEED A SENSITIVE ISSUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA CAN DIVIDE UP PEOPLE WHO MAY IN EFFECT LOSE THEIR REPRESENTATION OR VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE. SECOND, THE DIVISION OF SPACE INTO CONSTITUENCIES CAN BE SO ORGANISED THAT IT MAY CARVE OUT EITHER A SAFE SUPPORT BASE FOR A PARTY OR A CANDIDATE, OR CREATE A COMBINATION OF SOCIETAL FORCES WHICH ARE OPPOSED TO A PARTICULAR PARTY OR CANDIDATE. THIS TASK SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO IMPARTIAL AND NON-PARTISAN PERSONS. THIRDLY, A NEW BOUNDARY CAN CHANGE THE PATTERN OF ELECTORAL REPRESENTATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE LARGELY TO BENEFIT FROM IT VARIES FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY ACCORDING TO ITS ELECTORAL LAWS. IT VARIES FROM THE LARGELY NEUTRAL BRITISH CASE THROUGH SLIGHT PARTY INVOLVEMENT IN NEW ZEALAND TO THE TOTAL PARTY INVOLVEMENT IN THE USA (GUDGIN, G. & TAYLOR, P.J. (1979) SEATS, VOTES AND THE SPATIAL ORGANISATION OF ELECTIONS (P. 11), PION LTD, LONDON). IN SOUTH ASIA, IT VARIES FROM SRI LANKA WHERE THE DELIMITATION COMMISSION CONSISTS PURELY OF PERSONS WHO ARE ENTIRELY OUT OF POLITICS, TO INDIA WHERE THE DELIMITATION COMMISSION COMPRISING OF THREE PERSONS (TWO OF WHOM HAVE GENERALLY BEEN JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT AND STATE HIGH COURTS, AND THE THIRD MEMBER HAS BEEN THE CHIEF ELECTION COMMISSIONER, EX-OFFICIO) ASSOCIATES IN ITS DELIBERATIONS NINE POLITICIANS OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL SHADES IN EACH STATE. OF THESE, FOUR BELONG TO THE LOK SABHA (LOWER HOUSE OF INDIAN PARLIAMENT) AND FIVE TO THE VIDHAN SABHAS (LOWER HOUSE OF STATE LEGISLATURES) (CHANDIDAS, R. (1971) ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. IN: L.M. SINGHVI ET AL., ELECTIONS AND ELECTORAL REFORMS IN INDIA (P. 114). INSTITUTE OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS. NEW DELHI). BUT THE COMMISSION'S VERDICT IS FINAL AND CAN NOT BE CHALLENGED EVEN IN THE SUPREME COURT. IN SPITE OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF POLITICIANS, THERE HAVE HOWEVER BEEN NO OR LITTLE REPORTS OF GERRYMANDERING IN INDIA BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS. NEVERTHELESS, IT IS ALSO A FACT THAT NO STUDY OF THE ACTUAL DELIMITATION OF CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES AND ITS EFFECT ON ELECTORAL OUTCOME AND THE GEOGRAPHY OF REPRESENTATION IN INDIA COULD BE CARRIED OUT DUE TO THE SECRECY AND NON-AVAILABILITY OF DELIMITATION COMMISSIONS' REPORTS ON THE ACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DELIMITATION OF CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARIES. EVEN THOUGH CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY, REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS, LIMITATIONS ON THE ARBITRARY POWERS OF THE RULERS, AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE PRACTISED IN ANCIENT INDIA, AND SOME OF THE REPRESENTATIVES BODIES LIKE GRAM SANGHAS, GRANT SABHA OR PANCHAYATS HAVE SURVIVED UP TO NOW (KASHYAP, S.C. (1994) OUR CONSTITUTION (P. 7), NATIONAL BOOK TRUST OF INDIA, NEW DELHI), THE EXPERIENCE OF ELECTORAL PARTICIPATION IN A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY IS HARDLY ONE CENTURY OLD. IN FACT, THE TWENTIETH CENTURY IN INDIA COULD BE TERMED AS THE CENTURY OF TRANSFORMATION FROM BEING SUBJECT OF A BRITISH COLONY WITH NO RIGHT TO ELECT THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT TO THE LARGEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD. THE ELECTORAL EXPERIENCE OF INDIA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS: SELECTIVE ENFRANCHISEMENT IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD AND UNIVERSAL ADULT ENFRANCHISEMENT IN INDEPENDENT INDIA.

477	THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS SET IN THE TRAFFICKING PROTOCOL (ALSO KNOWN AS THE PALERMO PROTOCOL) FUNCTIONALLY CENTRES MOST OF THE RESPONSE TO THE PHENOMENON IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS OCCLUDES MANY OF THE SOCIOPOLITICAL DETERMINANTS OF VULNERABILITY THAT LEADS TO TRAFFICKING. IT ALSO DISCOURAGES ANY REAL DEBATE ABOUT THE VARIOUS FORMS OF OPPRESSION AND EVEN STRUCTURAL VIOLENCE THAT ACT AS CATALYSTS TO THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING MARKET. THE TRAFFICKING PROTOCOL, AND A VAST NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS, FOCUSES ON STATISTICS OF PROSECUTION RATES, ARRESTS, VICTIM TYPOLOGY AND ORGANISED CRIME. I USE THE EXAMPLE OF BRIDE TRAFFICKING ALONG THE SINO-BURMESE BORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLICATIONS AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, HARM THAT BEFALL AN ANTI-TRAFFICKING REGIME THAT DOES NOT USE A WIDER LENS OF MIGRATION, AGENCY, DEVELOPMENT AND GENDER EQUALITY TO ADDRESS THE FACTORS LEADING TO EXPLOITATION.
478	THE IDENTIFICATION OF UNKNOWN BODIES IS THE FULFILMENT OF A MORAL OBLIGATION TOWARDS THE DECEASED, SERVES TO MAINTAIN LEGAL SECURITY WITHIN A SOCIETY, AND GIVES FAMILIES THE CERTAINTY THEY NEED TO MOURN. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT RESPECTIVE LOCAL CONDITIONS, THE AIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO ACHIEVE A SECURE AND QUICK IDENTIFICATION. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, A FUNCTIONING COOPERATION BETWEEN INVESTIGATING AUTHORITIES AND FORENSIC SCIENCES IS ESSENTIAL. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CLARIFY THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF TATTOOS IN THE IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OF UNKNOWN DECEASED PERSONS IN THE STATE OF JALISCO, MEXICO. POST-MORTEM DATA OF 2045 BODIES FROM THE INSTITUTO JALISCIENCE DE CIENCIAS FORENSES IN GUADALAJARA WERE EVALUATED. OF THE DECEASED 46% WERE TATTOOED (MALE: 47%, FEMALE: 39%), WITH 29% OF ALL BODIES (MALE: 29%, FEMALE: 26%) SHOWING TATTOOS AT BODY LOCATIONS USUALLY VISIBLE IN EVERYDAY LIFE (I.E. HEAD AND NECK, FOREARMS AND HANDS). THE MALE BODIES WERE MOST FREQUENTLY TATTOOED ON THE SHOULDERS AND UPPER ARMS, FOLLOWED BY THE FOREARMS AND HANDS AND THE TORSO. FEMALE BODIES MOSTLY SHOWED TATTOOS ON THE FOREARMS AND HANDS, FOLLOWED BY THE TORSO AND LEGS. TAKING LOCAL TATTOOING HABITS INTO ACCOUNT, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED A CLASSIFICATION FOR TATTOO MOTIVES. WITH DECREASING FREQUENCY, THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS COULD BE ASSIGNED TO THE MOTIVES: LETTERS AND/OR NUMBERS, HUMAN, SYMBOL (OTHER), PLANT, SYMBOL (RELIGIOUS), ANIMAL, OBJECT, TRIBAL/ORNAMENT/GEOMETRY, FANTASY/DEMON/COMIC, OTHER. RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATE THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF TATTOOS AS A POSSIBLE MEAN OF IDENTIFICATION IN JALISCO, MEXICO - EITHER AS A STAND-ALONE IDENTIFICATION METHOD, AS A COMPLEMENTARY TOOL OR FOR PLANNING AND PRIORITIZING SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATIONS.
479	NORMS FOR CYBERSPACE REMAIN HIGHLY CONTESTED INTERNATIONALLY AMONG GOVERNMENTS AND FRAGMENTED DOMESTICALLY WITHIN GOVERNMENTS. DESPITE DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES AT THE UNITED NATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, INTERSUBJECTIVE AGREEMENT ON NORMS GOVERNING COERCIVE CYBER POWER IS STILL NASCENT. AGREED UPON, EXPLICITLY STATED NORMS ARE CONSIDERED VOLUNTARY, DEFINED VAGUELY, AND INTERNALIZED WEAKLY. IMPLICIT STATE PRACTICE IS SLOWLY EMERGING, YET POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND CLOAKED IN SECRECY. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION: HOW DO NORMS EMERGE FOR CYBERSPACE? WHAT HAS BEEN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UN PROCESS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S UNDERSTANDING OF NORMS FOR CYBERSPACE? WHY DID THE PROCESS COLLAPSE IN 2017, THE VERY SAME YEAR THAT TWO OF THE BIGGEST CYBER ATTACKS TO DATE-WANNACRY AND NOTPETYA-CAUSED INDISCRIMINATE ECONOMIC HARM WORLDWIDE EACH WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF SEVERAL BILLION U.S. DOLLARS? AND WHY DID MEMBER STATES, IN AN UNPRECEDENTED MOVE IN THE UN'S HISTORY, CREATE TWO SEPARATE PROCESSES DEDICATED TO THE SAME ISSUE IN 2018? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE VARIOUS FACTORS FEEDING INTO THE DYNAMIC PROCESS OF NORM CONTESTATION INCLUDING AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF THE PROCESS AT THE UNITED NATIONS, THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND THE MAIN POINTS OF CRITIQUES.
480	AFTER THE ELECTORAL VICTORIES OF 2015, PIS TRANSFORMED THE CT FROM AN EFFECTIVE, COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN DEVICE TO SCRUTINISE LAWS FOR THEIR UNCONSTITUTIONALITY, INTO A POWERLESS INSTITUTION PARALYSED BY CONSECUTIVE BILLS RENDERING IT UNABLE TO REVIEW NEW PIS LAWS, AND THEN INTO A POSITIVE SUPPORTER OF THE ENHANCED MAJORITARIAN POWERS. IN A FUNDAMENTAL REVERSAL OF THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, IT IS NOW BEING USED TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT FROM LAWS ENACTED LONG BEFORE PIS RULE. WHATEVER ELSE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE EXPECTED TO DO, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THEIR FIRST AND PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO ENSURE ADHERENCE TO A CONSTITUTION AND ITS PROTECTION AGAINST LEGISLATIVE MAJORITIES. IN POLAND, THE TRIBUNAL BECAME A DEFENDER AND PROTECTOR OF THE LEGISLATIVE MAJORITY. THIS CHANGED ROLE, COMBINED WITH GENERAL DISTRUST OF THE CT AND CONCERNS ABOUT LEGITIMACY OF ITS JUDGMENTS, EXPLAINS ALSO THE EXTRAORDINARY DROP IN THE NUMBER OF ITS JUDGMENTS. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, THE CT AS A MECHANISM OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW HAS CEASED TO EXIST: A RELIABLE AIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY HAS BEEN BORN.
481	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SERBIA HAS ONLY MARGINAL ROLE IN POLITICAL AND LEGAL LIFE OF THE SERBIAN SOCIETY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, VERY MODEST IMPACT ON THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION AND CONSOLIDATION. THIS CONCLUSION IS DRAWN ON THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE COURT'S INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN, SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND SELECTED CASES THAT INVOLVED THORNY CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES, AS WELL AS ISSUES OF THE COUNTRY'S COMPLIANCE WITH EUROPEAN STANDARDS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW THE COURT'S DEFERENCE TO THE POLITICAL MAJORITY IN POWER AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE DELAYING AND AVOIDING STRATEGIES IT EMPLOYS, MAKE IT IRRELEVANT IN THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION. YET, THE COURT PLAYS A MORE RELEVANT ROLE IN THE FIELD OF THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS (CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLAINTS COMPETENCE). HOWEVER, THESE ARE CASES WHICH USUALLY DO NOT INVOLVE MAJOR POLITICAL INTERESTS, SO THE COURT CAN RULE WITHOUT CONSTRAINTS, RELYING ON THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY AND APTLY. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE COURT'S LEGITIMACY IS WEAK. IN RESPECT TO THE INPUT LEGITIMACY THIS IS DUE TO THE NON-TRANSPARENT PROCESS OF SELECTION OF JUSTICES AND DISREGARD FOR THE SELECTION CRITERIA. PERCEPTIONS OF THE COURT BY THE GENERAL AND EXPERT PUBLIC ALSO REVEAL THAT IT LACKS BOTH SOCIOLOGICAL AND NORMATIVE LEGITIMACY. MOREOVER, THE OUTPUT LEGITIMACY IS POOR, SINCE THE EFFECT OF THE COURT'S DECISIONS IN THE ARTICULATION OF THE DOMINANT POLITICAL VALUES IN SERBIAN SOCIETY IS CLOSE TO INSIGNIFICANT.
482	IN THIS PAPER WE DRAW ON OUR WORK AT THE WORLD BANK TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL GUIDANCE ON HOW THE BANK AND OTHER DONORS MIGHT OPERATIONALIZE THE WDR 2011 SO AS TO PROMOTE THE EMERGENCE OF LEGITIMATE AND EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS TO MANAGE JUSTICE AND SECURITY IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT AFFECTED STATES (FCS). OUR APPROACH REFLECTS THREE PROPOSITIONS ABOUT HOW JUSTICE AND SECURITY INSTITUTIONS DEVELOP AND HOW DONORS CAN ENGAGE. FIRST, WE UNDERSTAND THAT JUSTICE AND SECURITY ARE NOT MERELY THE REMIT OF PARTICULAR FORMS OF INSTITUTION, BUT RATHER REPRESENT CORE FUNCTIONS OF ALL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. THIS REQUIRES A BROADER VIEW OF THE ARENAS AND ENTRY POINTS THROUGH WHICH DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND PROGRAMMING MAY IMPACT ON JUSTICE AND SECURITY. SECOND, ENGAGEMENTS TO SUPPORT LEGITIMATE AND EFFECTIVE JUSTICE AND SECURITY INSTITUTIONS REQUIRES LOOKING BEYOND THE LAWS, PROCEDURES, SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE THE USUAL FOCUS OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, TO THE PROCESSES OF ELITE BARGAINING, COLLECTIVE STRUGGLE AND NORMATIVE CHANGE THAT SHAPE INSTITUTIONS OVER TIME. THIRD, THE IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS ON THESE PROCESSES EXTEND FAR BEYOND THE TYPICALLY NARROW REMIT OF TECHNICAL "CAPACITY-BUILDING". UNDERSTANDING THESE IMPLICATIONS - INTENDED OR NOT - REQUIRES A CLOSER REVIEW OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGE IN PARTICULAR CONTEXTS.
483	MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF REBUILDING STATE INSTITUTIONS IN THE WAKE OF CONFLICT, OR IN THE CONTEXT OF WEAK OR FAILING STATES. THERE HAS HOWEVER BEEN MUCH LESS ATTENTION PAID TO HOW LOCAL FORMS OF GOVERNANCE DEVELOP, STRENGTHEN AND EVOLVE IN THE ABSENCE OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT A KEY ANALYTICAL TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING THIS PROCESS IS THROUGH THE LENS OF 'PROTECTION ECONOMIES', WHICH HAVE BECOME A KEY DIMENSION OF MOST MODERN CONFLICTS. THESE ARE THE ABILITY OF ARMED ACTORS TO GENERATE REVENUE AND CONSOLIDATE TERRITORIAL CONTROL THROUGH THE PROVISION OF PROTECTION AROUND BOTH LICIT AND ILLICIT RESOURCE FLOWS. THE RESULT IS THE STRENGTHENING OF SOME ACTORS OVER OTHERS, WHILE UNDERCUTTING THE PROSPECTS FOR LONGER TERM STABILITY OR STATE CONSOLIDATION, GIVEN THAT PROVIDERS OF PROTECTION OFTEN HAVE MORE TO GAIN FROM THE EVOLVING 'PROTECTION ECONOMY' THAN FROM POLITICAL COMPROMISE OR PEACE. WE DEMONSTRATE THIS THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF HOW LOCALISED PROTECTION ECONOMIES HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND SMUGGLING AND TRAFFICKING MARKETS, AND HOW THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPLOSION OF THE STATE IN LIBYA. THE ARTICLE DRAWS FROM EXTENSIVE FIELDWORK IN LIBYA DURING 2011-2013, A CRUCIAL PERIOD IN WHICH THE CENTRAL STATE AND LEGITIMATE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WAS UNDER CONSIDERABLE STRAIN FROM COMPETING LOCALISED MILITIA GROUPS. ARGUABLY, THE ROOTS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNANCE CRISIS CAN BE TRACED TO THE WAY THAT PROTECTION ECONOMIES STRENGTHENED THE ROLE OF CERTAIN ACTORS IN LOCAL GOVERNANCE, THEREBY FRAGMENTING TERRITORIAL CONTROL OVER THE COUNTRY.
484	IDEOLOGIES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD AND GREATLY AFFECT COURT ORGANISATION AND BEHAVIOUR. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? USING THE SOCIAL SCIENCE OF THE DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS, THIS PAPER ANALYSES HOW JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE DOCTRINES SPREAD TO SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN. THE STYLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THAT HAS MAINLY INFLUENCED KOREA AND TAIWAN FIRST DEVELOPED IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY GERMANY, FROM WHERE IT SPREAD TO JAPAN DURING THE MEIJI REFORMATION. IT MADE JUDGES BUREAUCRATICALLY ACCOUNTABLE TO A JUDICIARY THAT WAS THEORETICALLY VERY INDEPENDENT FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, BUT LEFT JUDGES SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE TO INTERNAL PRESSURES. KOREA AND TAIWAN RECEIVED THIS THEORY AND ITS RELATED COURT ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES FROM JAPAN DURING COLONISATION AND AFTERWARDS AS THEY VOLUNTARILY UPDATED THEIR INSTITUTIONS TO FOLLOW POST-WAR JAPANESE CHANGES. DURING YEARS OF AUTHORITARIAN RULE, THESE TWO COUNTRIES' COURTS LOST MUCH OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE. AFTER DEMOCRATISATION, ACTIVISTS CAME TO BE DISILLUSIONED WITH THE PREVAILING CONCEPTION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, AND CAME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AMERICAN IDEAS, UNDER WHICH JUDGES WOULD BE SELECTED TO LIFETIME POSITIONS AND NOT PROMOTED BUREAUCRATICALLY. AGITATING FOR REFORM, THESE ACTIVISTS ATTACKED THEIR JUDICIARIES AND ADVOCATED CHANGES. THE DIFFUSION OF THE US VISION OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IDEOLOGY DEPENDED ON THE STYLE OF DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, UNITY BETWEEN JUDGES AND REFORMERS OUTSIDE THE COURTS, AND THE DIFFUSION OF IDEAS THAT OCCURRED THROUGH THE ATTAINMENT OF EDUCATIONS IN AMERICA. CASE STUDIES OF THESE SIMILAR COUNTRIES CAN ILLUSTRATE HOW NOTIONS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ROOT AND DEVELOP IN FOREIGN NATIONS SEEKING TO MODERNISE THEIR COURT SYSTEMS.
485	THIS ESSAY OFFERS A PERSONAL READING OF PROF. MARTIN KRYGIER'S SCHOLARSHIP. LINKING THE HISTORY OF KRYGIER'S FAMILY WITH HIS VIEW ON SOCIOLOGICAL JURISPRUDENCE, ESPECIALLY ON THE LIVING LAW CONCEPT, I DRAW THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PERSONAL NARRATION OF RULES OF LIFE AND RULES OF LAW. HIS SCHOLARSHIP CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIVING LAW CONCEPT INTEGRATING PERSONAL NARRATIONS OF LIVING HUMANS IN LIVING LAW INSTITUTIONS.
486	THIS ESSAY TAKES UP THE QUESTION OF WHY HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOMETHING OF A PERIPHERAL CONCERN FOR MARTIN KRYGIER. THE ESSAY SUGGESTS THAT A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION LIES IN DIVERGENT WAYS IN WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD. THE FIRST UNDERSTANDING INVOKES HUMAN RIGHTS AS A VIOLATION OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY (THROUGH DEBASEMENT AND HUMILIATION; RAPE; TORTURE; SLAVERY). THE SECOND UNDERSTANDING EXTENDS HUMAN RIGHTS TO MATTERS OF THICK MORALITY (THROUGH THE HUMAN POTENTIAL FOR ENJOYMENT; GROWTH; FULFILMENT AND SELF-REALIZATION). ON THE FIRST UNDERSTANDING, KRYGIER BELIEVES (LIKE THOMAS NAGEL) THAT THE PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST OF AN ISSUE IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS REAL-LIFE SIGNIFICANCE. CRUELTY, EVIL AND ABUSE DEMAND DENUNCIATION AND PRACTICAL OPPOSITION, NOT SCHOLARLY DISCUSSION. FOR KRYGIER, SITUATIONS THAT INVOKE THE FIRST UNDERSTANDING ARE TOO OBVIOUS TO REQUIRE MUCH REFLECTION. ON THE SECOND UNDERSTANDING, KRYGIER BELIEVES THAT CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING. PARTICULAR HISTORIES, TRADITIONS AND LOCALITIES RADICALLY (AND RIGHTLY) ALTER THE WAY HUMANS SEEK FULFILMENT. SITUATIONS THAT INVOKE THE SECOND UNDERSTANDING CALL FOR THE ACCOMMODATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF MULTIPLE CONFLICTING PERSPECTIVES: THE LANGUAGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS LACKS THE NECESSARY NUANCE AND TEXTURE. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES THAT FOR STUDENTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE MYOPIA OF THEIR SUBJECT, KRYGIER'S LESSON IS A SALUTARY ONE.
487	WHAT IS NEEDED FOR STABILITY OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND WHAT CAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS DO IN THAT TASK? THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE QUESTION THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF KYRGYZSTAN: A COUNTRY BESET WITH CONSTITUTIONAL INSTABILITY FOR SOME 20 YEARS, WHERE A FORCEFUL CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 2010 FORTUITOUSLY PRODUCED A REAL BALANCED PLAYING FIELD OF POLITICAL POWERS WHICH, IN TURN, ALLOWED FOR ADOPTION OF A NEW, WELL-BALANCED CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. IN SUCH A CONTEXT, THE WORK OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER (OF THE SUPREME COURT) HAS BEEN THAT OF A BOLD, INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONTROL. THROUGH AN OVERVIEW OF THE INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE OF KYRGYZSTAN, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT AN EMERGENT CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, TO BE VIABLE, REQUIRES A REAL BALANCE OF POLITICAL POWERS; IF SUCH BALANCE IS PRESENT, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS REINFORCE THAT BALANCED ORDER BY PLAYING THE ROLE OF IMPARTIAL POLITICAL ARBITERS. THEY PLAY A VITAL POLITICAL ROLE, EXERCISED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LAW, TO EVER SO OFTEN DEFEND OR RESTORE A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER WHEN QUESTIONS OR DOUBTS ARISE. THE WORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, THUS VIEWED, STANDS AS A REMINDER THAT THERE IS AN INSEPARABLE CONTINUITY BETWEEN LAW AND POLITICS IN CONSTITUTION.
488	THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED RISE IN NEW ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (PPPS) WITHIN THE GLOBAL HEALTH SECTOR, OF WHICH THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA (GFATM) IS PERHAPS ONE THE MOST WELL-KNOWN. FROM ITS CONCEPTION, IT WAS HAILED AS A NEW BREED OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTION WHICH WOULD BE LESS BUREAUCRATIC, MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS. HOWEVER, THE GFATM HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION IN ITS OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN THIS NOTE, WE DRAW ON CASE STUDIES OF GFATM EXPERIENCES OF CORRUPTION IN UGANDA AND ZAMBIA TO ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN WELCOMING THIS NEW FORM OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE IN REGARD TO ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY STRENGTHS OF THE PPP STRUCTURE, IS THAT IT CREATES AUTONOMY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, WHICH CONSTITUTES A WEAKNESS WHEN THERE IS CORRUPTION. INDEED, DESPITE EVIDENCE OF WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION IN THE GFATM IN BOTH OF OUR CASE STUDY COUNTRIES, THE GFATM HAS BEEN UNABLE TO EFFECT SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF THE CULPRITS AND RECOVER MONEY THAT HAS BEEN SIPHONED OFF, AS BOTH THE UGANDAN AND THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE EXHIBITED A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL.
489	IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT VALUES ARE FLUID SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS WHICH CANNOT BE USED AS NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS OF MODERN SOCIETY. DESPITE THEIR TRANSCENDENTAL VALIDITY CLAIMS, THEY OPERATE AS IMMANENT TOOLS OF THE NORMALISATION OF SOCIETAL POWER AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF POTENTIA OF SOCIETAL FORCES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUCTORITAS. I SUBSEQUENTLY ARGUE THAT A SOCIOLOGY OF CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES MUST ADDRESS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MORAL VALUES IN LAW AND LAW AS A MORAL VALUE. CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES OF THE TRANSVALUATION OF VALUES ARE COMPLEX FORMS OF SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS IN WHICH UNDERSTANDING, CONSENSUS AND CONFORMITY MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS MUCH AS CONFUSION, DISSENT AND DEVIANCE. I CONCLUDE BY CLAIMING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL VALUATIONS AND TRANSVALUATIONS NEED TO BE EXPLAINED AS PART OF THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL SELF-REFERENTIALITY UNLIMITED BY NATION-STATES AND STRETCHING INTO CONTEMPORARY SUPRANATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL REGIMES OF LAW AND THEIR INTERNAL VALUE PRODUCTIONS.
490	WORLD GOVERNMENTS HAVE EMBRACED 'LEGAL EMPOWERMENT' AS AN END IN ITSELF AND AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY. CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS WORK TO ADVANCE LEGAL EMPOWERMENT AROUND THE GLOBE BUT, TO DATE, THERE IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THOSE EFFORTS. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS THE FIRST REVIEW AND MAPPING OF EXISTING EVIDENCE ON LEGAL EMPOWERMENT. WE IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED 199 STUDIES IN TOTAL. THESE STUDIES SPAN EVERY MAJOR CONTINENT AND ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS LEGAL LITERACY, COMMUNITY-BASED PARALEGALS, AND USE OF RIGHT TO INFORMATION LAWS. THE BREADTH AND RICHNESS OF THIS BODY OF WORK SUGGEST WE SHOULD REVISIT PREVIOUS PERCEPTIONS THAT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE ON WHAT LEGAL EMPOWERMENT CAN ACHIEVE. STRONGER AGENCY BOTH PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO ACT AND ACTUAL ACTION AS WELL AS INCREASED LEGAL KNOWLEDGE ARE THE MOST COMMON POSITIVE IMPACTS REPORTED IN THIS COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE. THE EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS LEGAL EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMS CAN LEAD TO ACQUISITION OF LEGAL REMEDIES, EFFECTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION, AND EVEN IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES. NEARLY NINETY STUDIES FIND POSITIVE IMPACTS OF LEGAL EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMS ON INSTITUTIONS CHANGES IN LAW, POLICY OR PRACTICE AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATION. AFTER EXPLORING DISTRIBUTIONS AND TRENDS IN THE EVIDENCE, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING GAPS AND QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INQUIRY TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH AND, ULTIMATELY, PROMOTE STRONGER, MORE EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE.
491	THIS PAPER CHARTS EVOLVING GOVERNMENT POLICIES TOWARDS PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN LIBYA, CONSIDERS JUSTICE SEEKING BY CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY LIBYA'S LAW 4/1978 ON REAL PROPERTY, AND THE REGIMES OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP PROPOSED BY THE STATE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO INTERVENE IN THESE DISPUTES BOTH PRIOR TO AND IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 2011 REVOLUTION. IT ALSO CONSIDERS WHAT LEEWAY CURRENT POLITICAL REALITIES ALLOW TO FORMULATE POLICY TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF LAW 4, BEFORE MAKING SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.
492	THE LINK BETWEEN EFFICIENT AND WELL-FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF A COUNTRY HAS BECOME THE CORE OF THE GOOD GOVERNANCE EFFORT. THE FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING THOSE PROCESSES STEMS FROM A BELIEF THAT WELL-DESIGNED UNDERLYING INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PARTICULAR GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS, I.E., RULES OF THE GAME, ALONG WITH A STRENGTHENING OF ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE MANDATES, CAN LEAD TO BETTER GOVERNANCE OUTCOMES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN COMBINATION WITH REGULAR MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE AND PUBLICATION OF FINDINGS, SO THAT CITIZENS AND POLICYMAKERS CAN BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE INFORMED JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW THESE SYSTEMS ARE FUNCTIONING. THIS PAPER WILL BEGIN WITH A DISCUSSION OF AGGREGATE INDICATORS OF GOVERNANCE, OUTLINING BOTH ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS TO BROAD MEASUREMENT APPROACHES. IT WILL THEN INTRODUCE A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE MEASUREMENT THAT SHIFTS THE FOCUS FROM BROAD CONCEPTS TO ACTUAL GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS, BUT WILL ALSO CAUTION AGAINST SIMPLISTIC DIVISIONS AMONG TYPES OF INDICATORS. FOLLOWING THAT WILL BE A DISCUSSION ON THE NATURE OF ACTIONABILITY AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO REFORM EFFORTS, AND AN EXPLANATION OF HOW ACTIONABLE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (AGIS) CAN PROVIDE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE DESIGN, CAPACITIES, PERFORMANCE, AND IMMEDIATE IMPACTS OF GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS. FINALLY, THE PAPER WILL PRESENT SCENARIOS IN WHICH ACTIONABLE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WERE DEVELOPED TO CAPTURE INFORMATION ON: 1) THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS OF INCOME AND ASSET DISCLOSURE, AND 2) THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCLOSURE SYSTEMS. DATA FROM BOTH INITIATIVES WILL BE PRESENTED, ALONG WITH THE INDICATORS.
493	THE AFRICAN UNION (AU) ADOPTED THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES OF DECENTRALISATION, LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (AFRICAN CHARTER ON DECENTRALISATION) IN 2014. THE CHARTER SEEKS TO PROMOTE DECENTRALISATION AS A VEHICLE FOR IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF PEOPLE ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. IT IS THE FIRST TO PROVIDE A DECENTRALISATION FRAMEWORK OR MODEL FRAMEWORK FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE AFRICAN CONTINENT. LIKE MOST INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS, MEMBER STATES OF THE AU WILL ONLY BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE CHARTER ONCE THEY HAVE RATIFIED IT. MOST MEMBER STATES OF THE AU HAVE NOT RATIFIED THE CHARTER DUE TO VARYING REASONS, INCLUDING, THE FACT THAT THE RATIFICATION PROCESS IN MANY COUNTRIES IS OFTEN CUMBERSOME. NON-RATIFICATION COULD ALSO BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOT YET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MEANING AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DECENTRALISATION FRAMEWORK WHICH THE CHARTER PROVIDES. THUS, THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE CHARTER ON CHANGING THE POOR STATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT UPON COMING INTO OPERATION IS AS YET UNKNOWN. THIS PROBLEM IS INFLATED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS PRESENT NO SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY ON THE CHARTER, GIVEN THAT IT IS RELATIVELY NEW. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CHARTER, LOOKING AT ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE ON DECENTRALISATION AND BEST' PRACTICES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
494	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF UNLAWFUL JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS IN POLAND IN A WAY CONSISTENT WITH THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR). ACCORDING TO THE POLISH CONSTITUTION, APPOINTMENTS OF JUDGES ARE MADE UPON THE REQUEST OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY (NCJ). AFTER CONTROVERSIAL REFORMS IN 2017, THIS BODY LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE FROM POLITICIANS. IN THE FOUR JUDGMENTS ISSUED SO FAR, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECTHR) RULED THAT APPOINTMENTS OF SUPREME COURT JUDGES MADE UPON THE REQUEST OF POLITICISED NCJ WERE BURDENED WITH MANIFEST VIOLATION OF DOMESTIC LAW AND, AS A RESULT, PANELS OF COURTS COMPOSED OF PERSONS APPOINTED IN THIS WAY WERE NOT 'TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED BY LAW'. ARGUABLY, THIS CONCLUSION MAY BE EXTENDED TO OTHER JUDGES APPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY. THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOWEVER, WHAT TO DO WITH PERSONS APPOINTED WITH VIOLATION OF LAW; IN PARTICULAR, WHETHER SUCH PERSONS CAN SIMPLY BE REMOVED FROM THE JUDICIARY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EVEN THOUGH THE DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES HAVE SOME DISCRETION WITH REGARDS TO CHOOSING THE PROPER MEASURES TO FIX THE PROBLEM OF UNLAWFULLY APPOINTED JUDGES, THIS IS LIMITED BY THE NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS STEMMING FROM THE ECHR. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESPECT UNLAWFULLY APPOINTED PERSONS' RIGHT TO COURT. THIS MEANS THAT INSTEAD OF REMOVING ALL OF THEM WITHOUT ANY JUDICIAL REVIEW, A MORE INDIVIDUALISED APPROACH WOULD BE PREFERABLE.
495	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSPLANTING GLOBAL LEGAL NORMS INTO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SPECIFICALLY THE PROBLEM OF 'FALSE FRIENDS.' THIS IS A LINGUISTICS CONCEPT DESCRIBING THE SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN TWO WORDS IN TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, LEADING SPEAKERS OF EACH LANGUAGE TO ASSUME, INCORRECTLY, THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE WORD'S MEANING IN THE OTHER LANGUAGE. EVEN MORE PROBLEMATICALLY, THE MISUNDERSTANDING IS HIDDEN BY THE ASSUMPTION OF UNDERSTANDING. WE ARGUE THAT SIMILAR PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR WHEN THERE IS A SUPERFICIAL SIMILARITY (BUT A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH) BETWEEN PARTICULAR GLOBAL AND LOCAL NORMS. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIMES AND THEIR RECEPTION IN VANUATU AND MEXICO, SHOWING HOW REFORMS ARE SOMETIMES WELCOMED INTO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON THE BASIS OF FALSE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEIR AIMS ARE CONGRUENT WITH EXISTING UNDERSTANDINGS. FINALLY, THE PAPER DEVELOPS SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR AVOIDING THE 'FALSE FRIENDS' PROBLEM IN A TRANSNATIONAL LEGAL CONTEXT.
496	RECOGNIZING THE GROWING TENSIONS BETWEEN AUTOCRATS IN THE CENTER AND OPPOSITION-LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN HUNGARY, POLAND AND TURKEY SINCE 2018-2019 LOCAL ELECTIONS, THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO EXISTING LITERATURE ON ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES WITH A SUBNATIONAL PORTION OF ILLIBERAL PLAYBOOK. TACTICS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE DETAILED STUDY OF THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT AND BRIEF REVIEW OF LATIN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE LEAVES US WITH THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES IN THE PLAYBOOK: ABUSE OF (EXISTING) SUPERVISORY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS; GENERATING OF FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY; CENTRALIZATION (OUTRIGHT AND INDIRECT) AND DECONCENTRATION. EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES ASSEMBLE VARIOUS MEANS EVOLVING THROUGH APPLICATION AND REINTERPRETATION OF TRADITIONAL RULES PERTAINING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS CRISIS-INDUCED INNOVATIONS. WHILE THE POLISH ACCOUNT CARRIES THE OPTIMISM STILL THAT ANTECEDENT ROBUST GUARANTEES AND POPULAR SUPPORT MATTER EVEN WHEN ILLIBERALS RULE THE CENTER, THE PLAYBOOK PROVED SUCCESSFUL IN HUNGARY AND TURKEY. ALTHOUGH CERTAIN INCREMENTALISM STAYED AS THE MOST VULNERABLE ACTORS WERE THE FIRST VICTIMS OF SOON-TO-BE NORMALIZED MEASURES, CRISIS IN HUNGARY AND POLAND DID STRETCH THE LIMITS TO THE POINT THAT ULTERIOR MOTIVES OF UNDERMINING OPPOSITION-LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAME PUBLICLY OBSERVABLE. REFLECTING ON THIS PHENOMENON, IN THE END, THE ARTICLE POSES A THEORETICAL QUESTION WHETHER SUCH PRETEXTUAL INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF LAW CAN ITSELF BE JUDICIALLY MANAGEABLE, AT LEAST IN SITUATIONS WHEN CLEAR POLITICAL OPPONENTS ARE TARGETED.
497	IN 2010, THE WORLD BANK AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFID) FUNDED AND ORCHESTRATED AN INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A TOOL TO MONITOR CORRUPTION PERFORMANCE IN UGANDA ON AN ONGOING BASIS. BY BASING OPERATIONS IN A LOCAL UNIVERSITY-BASED RESEARCH CENTER AND ENGAGING THE INSPECTORATE GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT TO MANAGE THE PROJECT, THE TOOL IS BECOMING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT. THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY RESEARCH CENTER IS WORKING WITH GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE GOVERNMENT COLLECTION OF SECTORAL AND FUNCTIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION DATA. IN ADDITION, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERNATIONAL CORRUPTION DATA HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION ON CORRUPTION. DONORS CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE - FUNDING THE PROJECT LAUNCH, AND PROVIDING ONGOING GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT TO ENGAGE EXECUTIVE AGENCIES, PARLIAMENT, NGOS, AND THE MEDIA. THE PROJECT HAS HAD SOME POSITIVE AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS. WHILE THE PROJECT REMAINS IN EARLY STAGES, THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THIS GRADUAL, DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH IS DEEPENING THE PUBLIC DIALOGUE ON CORRUPTION AND CREATING AN IMPORTANT CONSENSUS FOR ANTI-CORRUPTION REFORM.
498	CHILE IS A COUNTRY CROSSED BY ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES. THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS HAS OPENED A SPACE TO PROBLEMATIZE THE INSTITUTIONS THAT REPRODUCE THESE INEQUALITIES. THIS PAPER JOINS INTO THIS DISCUSSION ARGUING THAT A NUANCED FOCUS ON THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW WOULD FIT THE FUTURE CONSTITUTION BETTER. I LABEL THIS FOCUS 'NUANCED', IN REACTION TO INTERNATIONAL LAW'S LIMITED ABILITY TO ADDRESS JUSTICE CLAIMS LOCATED AT THE CORE OF CHILE'S SOCIAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL DISCONTENT. I ARGUE THAT THE RIGHT TO HEALTH UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW IS UNLIKELY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF UNEQUAL ENJOYMENT OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT A BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO INTEGRATE A SOLIDARISTIC UNDERSTANDING TO THIS HUMAN RIGHT. THE ADDED VALUE OF SOLIDARITY TRANSLATES IN A MORE SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF SOCIAL RIGHTS WHERE THEY BECOME AT THE SERVICE OF THE LIBERTY OF ALL. THROUGH A CRITICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE INCEPTION OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH UNDER CHILE'S CURRENT CONSTITUTION, THE PAPER SHOWS THE LIMITATIONS OF TODAY'S UNDERSTANDING AND THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION IT PROPOSES.
499	THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL REREADING OF THE HISTORY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN TURKEY. WE ARGUE THAT, CONTRARY TO APPEARANCES, THE CLAIM TO A POWER OF AMENDMENT REVIEW ON THE PART OF THE TURKISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DOES NOT FIT RAN HIRSCHL' S MODEL OF HEGEMONIC PRESERVATION, WHICH AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE GENESIS OF STRONG CONSTITUTIONALISM AND JUDICIAL REVIEW AS THE RESULT OF AN ANTI -DEMOCRATIC ELITE CONSENSUS THAT TRIES TO LEVERAGE THE PRESTIGE OF JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS. ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE HIRSCHL' S MODEL ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE TURKISH REPUBLIC HAVE BEEN VERY POPULAR IN THE JURISPRUDENTIAL LITERATURE ON TURKEY, BUT THE MODEL OFFERS A MISLEADING AND INCOMPLETE DIAGNOSIS OF WHAT AILS TURKISH CONSTITUTIONALISM. IT IS NOT THE SUPPOSED EXCESSIVE STRENGTH OF FORMAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND JUDICIAL REVIEW IN TURKEY, BUT RATHER THE NORMATIVE WEAKNESS OF THE TURKISH CONSTITUTION OF 1982, THAT IS RESPONSIBLE, AT LEAST IN PART, FOR TURKEY'S REPEATED CONSTITUTIONAL CRISES. WE THEREFORE SUGGEST AN ALTERNATIVE TEMPLATE FOR UNDERSTANDING TURKISH CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY-THE THEORY OF SOVEREIGNTY AS THE POWER TO DECIDE ON THE EXCEPTION PUT FORWARD BY CARL SCHMITT.
500	IN THE EARLY 2000S, THE JUSTICE COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF CUSTOMARY JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT. THIS TRIGGERED A WAVE OF RESEARCH BY POLICY AND PROGRAMMING AGENCIES, AIMED AT CRAFTING A NARRATIVE FOR ENGAGEMENT AND IDENTIFYING ENTRY POINTS. THE DECADES OF PROGRAMMING THAT FOLLOWED CLOSELY REFLECTED THESE RESEARCH OUTCOMES. THIS PAPER REVISITS THIS RESEARCH BY COMPARING KEY FINDINGS TO A DATASET OF 3894 INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED BY THE TERRE DES HOMMES FOUNDATION (TDH) WITH 259 CUSTOMARY ACTORS IN AFGHANISTAN, EGYPT, LEBANON, BURKINA FASO, THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP. WHILE THE DATA SUPPORTS THE VALIDITY OF SOME RESEARCH FINDINGS, OTHERS ARE CONTESTED, SUGGESTING A DISCONNECT BETWEEN HOW THE PROGRAMMING COMMUNITY BELIEVES CJS OPERATE, AND HOW THEY OPERATE IN PRACTICE. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMING AGENCIES AND THOSE INTENDED TO BENEFIT FROM REFORMS ARE DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS LESSONS FOR PROGRAMMATIC RESEARCH MORE GENERALLY.
501	IN THEIR ARTICLE 'STRIKING BACK' AND 'CLAMPING DOWN': AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON JUDICIAL REVIEW, CAROL HARLOW AND RICHARD RAWLINGS CONSIDER THE WAYS IN WHICH AN EXECUTIVE MAY RESPOND TO JUDICIAL DECISIONS WHICH FIND AGAINST IT. THEY ORGANIZE SUCH RESPONSES OR 'TACTICS' INTO 'STRIKING BACK' ACCORDING TO WHICH THE EXECUTIVE ATTEMPTS TO NULLIFY THE EFFECT OF THE JUDGMENT, AND 'CLAMPING DOWN' IN TERMS OF WHICH THE GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO PREVENT FUTURE ADVERSE JUDGMENTS. HARLOW AND RAWLINGS CONSIDER SUCH TACTICS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND FIND THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TACTICS IN THE COUNTRY'S TRANSITION FROM A SYSTEM OF PURE PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY TO ONE INFLUENCED BY EUROPEAN LAW AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998. IN THIS PAPER I CONSIDER THE PRACTICES OF 'STRIKING BACK' AND 'CLAMPING DOWN', IDENTIFIED BY HARLOW AND RAWLINGS, IN THE CONTEXT OF SOUTH AFRICA. I POSE THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE OF TACTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA MOVING FROM A SYSTEM OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY TO ONE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY. I ALSO CONSIDER HOW EFFECTIVE THESE TACTICS HAVE BEEN UNDER EACH SYSTEM. MY FINDING IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TACTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA, AS THE CONSTITUTION HAS PLACED RESTRAINTS ON THE TACTICS AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT IN STRIKING BACK AND CLAMPING DOWN, LEADING THE GOVERNMENT TO RESORT TO MORE EXTREME MEASURES WHICH IN TURN THREATEN SOUTH AFRICA'S CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY.
502	THE CENTRAL QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS ARTICLE IS: WHAT DOES THIS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TELL US ABOUT THE NATURE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF JUDICIAL REFORM IN ASIA? THIS CASE STUDY OF THE JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAM OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) EXPERIENCE 1990-2007 IS FRAMED WITHIN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT OF SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH, UNDERWHELMING RESULTS, AND CONTINUING EVOLUTION OF APPROACH IN AN ONGOING SEARCH FOR SUCCESS. THE CASE STUDY MARSHALS AND EVALUATES A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF NEW EVIDENCE FROM ASIA WHICH HAS BEEN REMARKABLY UNDER-STUDIED IN THE ACADEMIC DISCOURSE. THIS BODY OF EXPERIENCE CONTRIBUTES TIMELY EVIDENCE OF PRACTICE WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT IN SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF KEY PROPOSITIONS. FIRST, IT REVEALS THE STILL EVOLVING NATURE OF THE JUDICIAL REFORM ENTERPRISE. SECOND, IT DEMONSTRATES THAT ADB HAS CREATED SOME 'RESULTS'. THIRD, IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF 'SUCCESS' OWING TO THE CONTINUING CONCEPTUAL FUZZINESS IN THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF ENDEAVOR, AND THE CONTINUING LACK OF SYSTEMATIC MONITORING AND EVALUATION. FOURTH, THERE ARE SOME TENTATIVE INDICATIONS OF AN EMERGING CAPACITY TO DEMONSTRATE DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS. WHILE THIS EVIDENCE GENERALLY CONFORMS TO THE GLOBAL LITERATURE, THE RECENCY OF ENDEAVOR IN THIS REGION REVEALS A DYNAMIC PROCESS OF EVOLUTION, AND HIGHLIGHTS THE INCUBATION OF A POTENTIALLY PARADIGMATIC SHIFT IN REFORM APPROACH.
503	ENSURING THE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM CAN BE DIFFICULT BOTH FOR POLICYMAKERS AND UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES. HENCE, GREAT EMPHASIS SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE DEFENSIVE FUNCTION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE THE LEGAL REGULATIONS AND THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS OF GERMANY, HUNGARY, POLAND, PORTUGAL, AND SPAIN. WE IDENTIFY WHO IS THE HOLDER OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM, HOW THE DEFENSIVE FUNCTION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM WORKS AND WHAT ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES ARE BEING PROTECTED. THE STUDY SHOWS THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES EMPHASISE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE DEFENSIVE FUNCTION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM BUT REMAIN UNANIMOUS ON THE ESSENCE OF THIS FUNCTION. AS ACADEMIC FREEDOM IS NOT DEFINED UNEQUIVOCALLY IN MOST CONSTITUTIONS AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS, CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SHAPING ITS DEFENSIVE FUNCTION.
504	THE 2013 CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE RECOGNISES LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS THE LOWEST TIER OF GOVERNMENT IN A THREE TIER ARRANGEMENT. THUS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, COMPOSED BY URBAN AND RURAL LOCAL AUTHORITIES, NOW OWES ITS EXISTENCE DIRECTLY TO THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT TO LEGISLATION AS WAS THE CASE UNDER THE PREVIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 'MANAGE' AND 'REPRESENT' THE AFFAIRS OF PEOPLE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS. EVERY LOCAL AUTHORITY IS GIVEN THE 'RIGHT TO GOVERN' ITS JURISDICTION WITH 'ALL' THE NECESSARY POWERS TO DO SO, INCLUDING DEVOLVED POWERS. THUS, THE CONSTITUTION RECOGNISES THAT, FOR THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH DECENTRALISATION TO BE REALISED, LOCAL AUTHORITIES REQUIRE A CERTAIN MEASURE OF LOCAL AUTONOMY. THE AUTONOMY WHICH THIS CONSTITUTION AFFORDS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS HOWEVER UNKNOWN AND UNEXPLORED, ESPECIALLY FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW POINT OF VIEW. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE MEASURE THE DEGREE OF LOCAL AUTONOMY GUARANTEED BY THE 2013 CONSTITUTION.
505	MICRO-ENTERPRISE IS IMPORTANT TO SURVIVING OR ESCAPING POVERTY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY CITIES. MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS, INFORMAL IN TERMS OF BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL LAW, ARE STIGMATIZED, RENDERED LIABLE TO LEGAL ENFORCEMENT, THEIR ACCESS TO CREDIT IS LIMITED, AND THE GROWTH OF THEIR BUSINESSES IS IMPEDED. AS INTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TODAY ADDRESS BUSINESS INFORMALITY AMONG LARGER ENTERPRISES, THE BUSINESS-LAW INFORMALITY OF MICRO-ENTERPRISE HAS BEGUN TO ATTRACT SCHOLARLY AND PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION. DRAWING ON A DESK STUDY AND FIELD STUDIES IN TANZANIA IN 2007 AND 2011, AND FOCUSING ON STREET VENDORS, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL OF PROPOSED LEGAL EMPOWERMENT REFORMS TO OVERCOME BARRIERS AND DISINCENTIVES TO MICRO-BUSINESS FORMALISATION. THE PROPOSED REFORMS COULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING THESE BARRIERS BUT, ECHOING CRITICISMS OF THE COMMISSION FOR LEGAL EMPOWERMENT OF THE POOR, THE REFORM PROCESS HAS ONLY PARTIALLY ADDRESSED THE POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE REFORMS AND THE MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS THEY ARE EXPECTED TO LEGITIMATE.
506	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE UTILITY OF GLOBAL INDICES AND INDICATORS OF JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THOSE DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING COUNTRY REFORMS. IT ARGUES THAT DESPITE THE RECURRENT INTEREST OF DONORS IN SPONSORING THESE GLOBAL SYSTEMS, THEY ARE OF LIMITED USE FOR REFORMERS BECAUSE 1) THEY OPERATE AT TOO HIGH A LEVEL; 2) THEY CONSEQUENTLY FAIL TO CAPTURE THE TYPES OF CHANGES PROMOTED BY REFORM; AND 3) THEY ARE TOO EASILY 'GAMED.' A MORE SIGNIFICANT DRAWBACK HOWEVER IS THEIR LIKELY DISCOURAGEMENT OF EFFORTS TO DEVELOP IN-COUNTRY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OR DATABASES ON KEY EVENTS IN CASE PROCESSING THAT COULD BE USED TO GENERATE MORE REFORM-SPECIFIC MEASURES. DONORS MUST BEAR PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY HERE AS THEIR FINANCING OF COURT AND SECTOR-WIDE AUTOMATION HAS OVERLOOKED THIS NEED AS WELL.
507	ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IN THE DEBATE ON URBAN CONSTITUTIONALISM IS HOW CONSTITUTIONS CAN RECOGNIZE THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE OF CITIES IN RELATION TO THE NATION-STATE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CITY AUTONOMY. THIS IS A PRESSING QUESTION, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF EUROPEAN UNITARY STATES. THIS PAPER PAYS SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CONTEXT OF TWO OF SUCH STATES, NAMELY THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (ESPECIALLY ENGLAND). FIRST, IT EXPLORES THE NOTION OF SUBSIDIARITY, WHICH IMPLIES THAT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THE CITY AS REGARDS THE ALLOCATION OF POWER TO THE CENTRAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, THIS IDEA IN ITSELF CANNOT JUSTIFY THE CASE FOR CITY AUTONOMY, AS THE CLAIM THAT THE ATTRIBUTION OF AUTONOMOUS POWERS TO CITIES MAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DECISION-MAKING IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE NEEDS ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. SECOND, IT INVESTIGATES THE CONCEPT OF CITY AUTONOMY BY EXPLORING THE FUZZINESS OF THE NOTION OF THE CITY. IN ADDITION, IT INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF 'SPATIAL IDENTITIES' IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF (LARGE) CITIES AND THEIR SURROUNDING (RURAL) AREAS. LASTLY, IT CONCLUDES THAT IF THE IMPORTANCE OF CITIES AS CONSTITUTIONAL ACTORS IS TO BE INCREASED, IT SHOULD BE DONE SO IN AN INFORMAL WAY RATHER THAN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF FORMAL CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS BOTH FROM A PRAGMATIC AND A NORMATIVE PERSPECTIVE.
508	EMPIRICAL INDICATORS ARE WIDELY USED IN BOTH DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF JUSTICE SYSTEMS. MOST EXISTING INDICATOR INITIATIVES BASE THEIR FINDINGS ON EXPERT SURVEYS, DOCUMENT REVIEWS, ADMINISTRATIVE DATA, OR PUBLIC SURVEYS. WHILE EACH OF THESE DATA SOURCES IS SUITED TO THE MEASUREMENT OF PARTICULAR FACETS OF JUSTICE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, RELIANCE ON JUST ONE OR TWO SOURCES OF INFORMATION CAN INTRODUCE SYSTEMATIC BIAS, DISTORTING THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH OF THE COMMONLY USED TYPES OF INDICATOR DATA AND DESCRIBES AN APPROACH THAT USES CLUSTERS OF INDICATORS DRAWN FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. THIS METHOD CAN REFLECT THE COMPLEX AND MULTIFACETED NATURE OF JUSTICE SYSTEMS WHILE INCLUDING CHECKS ON THE BIASES INHERENT IN INDIVIDUAL DATA SOURCES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE STRENGTHS AND DRAWBACKS OF THIS METHOD COMPARED TO APPROACHES MORE COMMONLY ADOPTED BY EXISTING INDICATOR INITIATIVES.
509	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE COMPLEX EMPIRICAL LANDSCAPE OF JUSTICE AND SECURITY PROVISION IN POST-WAR MOZAMBIQUE, AND ITS POLITICAL DYNAMICS. IT SCRUTINISES THE FORMAL POLICY FRAMEWORK, WHICH TODAY RECOGNISES LEGAL PLURALISM. THE CURRENT LEGISLATION NOT ONLY FAILS TO FULLY RECOGNISE THE DE FACTO ROLE PLAYED BY NON-STATE PROVIDERS, BUT ALSO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VARIOUS LAYERS OF INFORMAL INTERACTION AND COMPETITION THAT IN PRACTICE OCCUR BETWEEN THESE AND OFFICIAL STATE INSTITUTIONS. THERE ARE POLITICAL REASONS FOR THIS. JUSTICE AND SECURITY PROVISION CONSTITUTE A MINEFIELD OF POWER INTERESTS AND OVERLAPPING CLAIMS TO AUTHORITY, WHICH HAVE DEEP HISTORICAL ROOTS. STATE OFFICIALS AND THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT FEAR LOSING POWER IF NON-STATE ACTORS ARE GIVEN CLEAR RIGHTS AND MANDATES. UNCLEAR LEGISLATION ALSO EASES POLITICAL INSTRUMENTALISATION BY POLITICIANS AND POWER-HOLDERS. THE RISK IS THAT JUSTICE AND SECURITY PROVISION BECOMES MORE ABOUT POLITICS THAN ABOUT PROBLEM SOLVING AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE.
510	OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES, DONOR-DRIVEN JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS HAVE LARGELY FOLLOWED TWO PARALLEL PARADIGMS: ONE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE OTHER CENTERED ON STATE-BUILDING AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF PEACE IN COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM VIOLENT CONFLICT. OPERATIONALLY, HOWEVER, THESE MODELS FACE THE SAME CONUNDRUM: THEY DRAW ON A BROAD CONSENSUS THAT JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS ARE INTRINSICALLY AND INSTRUMENTALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND YET HAVE A TRACK RECORD DEMONSTRATING THAT MUCH REMAINS TO BE LEARNED. THESE PARADIGMS HAVE INCREASINGLY CONVERGED IN RECENT YEARS, AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2011 (ON CONFLICT AND SECURITY), PROVIDING A BASIS FOR RETHINKING APPROACHES TO JUSTICE REFORM IN FRAGILE AND CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES. THESE APPROACHES ARE BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY OF CHANGE, A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO INVESTING IN RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF LOCAL CONTEXTS, AND A MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO BUILDING LOCALLY LEGITIMATE JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS CAPABLE OF MITIGATING THE SOCIETAL STRESSES THAT FEED CYCLES OF CONFLICT.
511	THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF LOCAL OWNERSHIP HAS SO OFTEN BEEN DISREGARDED IN JUSTICE REFORM AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR). IN DOING SO, IT IDENTIFIES VARIOUS DILEMMAS THAT ACCOUNT FOR THIS LACK OF REGARD, INCLUDING ISSUES RELATING TO LOCAL VS. INTERNATIONAL NORMS; DONOR VS. LOCAL INTERESTS AND REPRESENTATIONAL ISSUES AT THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT WILL EXAMINE HOW LOCAL OWNERSHIP DILEMMAS IMPACT ON PROGRAMMING INCLUDING DURING THE ASSESSMENT, IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING AND EVALUATION STAGES AND THEN CONSIDER HOW LOCAL OWNERSHIP CAN BE STRENGTHENED PARTICULARLY IN FRAGILE STATES.
512	THIS ESSAY SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE THAT ASKS HOW INTERIM CONSTITUTIONS CAN BECOME SELF-ENFORCING NORMS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A SUCCESSFUL CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS. IT USES THE CHILEAN CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS AS AN EXAMPLE TO THEORIZE ON HOW THE POLITICAL NARRATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOVEMBER 2019 AGREEMENT, WHICH SETS THE FRAMEWORK FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, CAN INFLUENCE ITS SELF-ENFORCING CAPACITY. THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY AND RECONSTRUCT THE TWO PREVAILING NORMATIVE THEORIES UNDERLYING THE CHILEAN CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS: THE EVOLUTIVE AND THE REVOLUTIONARY NARRATIVES. THESE PRESENT THEMSELVES IN BOTH RADICAL AND MODERATE VERSIONS. WHILE EVOLUTIVE IDEAS EMPHASIZE INSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY, CONSENSUS-BUILDING, AND AN INCREMENTALIST APPROACH TO CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, REVOLUTIONARY ARGUMENTS RELY ON THE CONSTITUENT POWER THEORY AND PUSH FOR A PROFOUND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION THAT CAN BREAK WITH THE PAST. EVEN THOUGH THESE NARRATIVES ARE IN TENSION WITH EACH OTHER IN MANY RESPECTS, THEY HAVE BOTH INFLUENCED THE DESIGN OF THE RULES OF THE CONSTITUTION-MAKING PROCESS. THE AUTHORS CLAIM THAT THE SELF-ENFORCING CAPACITY OF THE INTERIM CONSTITUTION PARTLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE MODERATE VERSIONS OF THESE NARRATIVES SUCCEED OR PREVAIL IN THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.
513	WHILE, IN THE UK, ATTITUDES TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY INVESTIGATED LESS EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO MEASURE ATTITUDES TO THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, GLOBALLY, THERE ARE INCREASINGLY NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF STUDIES OF ATTITUDES TO CIVIL JUSTICE. ROBUST STANDARDISED SCALES ARE IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISHING CHANGE AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS; FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CONTEXT OF UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16.3. PAST FOCUS HAS BEEN ON DEVELOPING COMPOSITE INDICATORS'. THIS PAPER SEES THE APPLICATION OF MODERN PSYCHOMETRIC METHODS TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF REFLECTIVE' INSTRUMENTS TO MEASURE SINGLE UNIDIMENSIONAL ATTITUDE DIMENSIONS. DRAWING ON RELEVANT THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS, WE ADMINISTERED AN ITEM POOL OF 35 ATTITUDE QUESTIONS TO A SAMPLE OF 1061 ADULTS ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY ATTITUDE DOMAINS, FOLLOWED BY RASCH ANALYSIS TO CONSTRUCT SCALES WITH ACCEPTABLE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES. AN INACCESSIBILITY OF JUSTICE (IOJ) SCALE AND A PERCEIVED INEQUALITY OF JUSTICE (PIJ) SCALE RESULTED. RESPONDENTS WHO REGARDED THEMSELVES AS HAVING HANDLED PAST CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEMS POORLY OR HAVING EXPERIENCED UNFAIR OUTCOMES HAD HIGHER IOJ AND PIJ SCORES. NEGATIVE ACCOUNTS OF LAWYERS OR COURTS FROM OTHERS WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SCORES. OUR SUBSTANTIVE FINDINGS HELP EXPLAIN HOW NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES OF PROBLEM RESOLUTION CAN RESULT IN FRUSTRATED RESIGNATION' FOR LATER PROBLEMS, AND SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND ACCOUNTS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN MAINTAINING PUBLIC SUPPORT. THE SCALES HAVE BROAD JUSTICE POLICY UTILITY AND THE METHODS PROVIDE A TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE RELATED SCALE DEVELOPMENT.
514	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE THE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SO-CALLED BLACK AND WHITE TRACKS OF THE DUAL COMMERCIAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN UKRAINE THROUGH A FIVE-YEAR ETHNOGRAPHIC CASE STUDY OF THE COURT EXPERIENCES OF SELECTED UKRAINIAN COMPANIES. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CONFIRM THAT THE MAJORITY OF LITIGANTS IN ROUTINE CASES HAVE RATHER POSITIVE EXPERIENCES IN THE COURTS, WHILE A MINORITY OF THE CASES ARE DIVERTED TO THE BLACK TRACK RESULTING IN JUSTICE NOT BEING DELIVERED. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE BLACK TRACK WITHIN THE UKRAINIAN JUDICIARY IS CONSCIOUSLY DESIGNED AND REINFORCED BY THE RULING ELITE AS PART OF THE STATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND IS SUBJECTED TO MORE DIVERSE AND CONTRADICTORY PRESSURES THAN IN RUSSIA. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS STUDY REVEALS THE ASTONISHING EFFICIENCY OF THE COMMERCIAL COURTS IN TERMS OF TIME AND COST SAVINGS. THIS ZEBRA-LIKE IMAGE SUGGESTS THAT THE WHITE 'STRIPES' OF THE UKRAINIAN COURTS ARE BRIGHTER, AND THE BLACK 'STRIPES' ARE EVEN DARKER THAN COMMONLY PERCEIVED.
515	THE RECENT EMPHASIS PLACED ON ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AS MEANS OF COMBATTING CORRUPTION IN LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES REFLECTS A GREAT DEAL OF OPTIMISM ABOUT THE ABILITY OF LAW TO EFFECT SOCIAL CHANGE. THE MORE GENERAL LITERATURE ON LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SUGGESTS SEVERAL REASONS FOR SKEPTICISM ON THIS FRONT: THE RISK THAT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WILL BE CAPTURED BY POWERFUL INTERESTS; THE POSSIBILITY THAT LAW PLAYS ONLY A LIMITED ROLE AS A MEANS OF SOCIAL CONTROL; AND, IN THE CASE OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW, THE LIMITED POWER, WILL, KNOWLEDGE, AND LEGITIMACY OF FOREIGN ACTORS. THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CONCERNS PROVIDE GROUNDS FOR SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF ANTI-CORRUPTION LAW.
516	SOCIAL MOVEMENTS HAVE CONTESTED THE ELITIST CHARACTER OF CHILEAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE STREETS FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES. CITIZENS HAVE DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM CONVENTIONAL PARTICIPATION, AND TURNOUT RATES DROPPED DRAMATICALLY. PROTESTING AGAINST UNEQUAL TREATMENT AND DEMANDING "DIGNITY," THE SOCIAL UPRISING IN 2019 IN CHILE CONSISTED OF MASSIVE PROTESTS MARKED BY LARGE-SCALE DEMONSTRATIONS AND VIOLENT RIOTS ALIKE. LASTING MANY WEEKS, THE PROTEST-DRIVEN CRISIS OPENED UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. POLITICAL ELITES AGREED ON A REFERENDUM ON A NEW CONSTITUTION TO CHANNEL HETEROGENEOUS DEMANDS PUT FORWARD BY LEADERLESS AND INORGANIC PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE SOCIAL UPRISING SET IN MOTION INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THAT, CONFIRMING THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS, ENTIRELY DEPARTS FROM THE STATUS QUO. FURTHERMORE, AMIDST A PROFOUND REPRESENTATION CRISIS, SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS PUSHED FOR REFORMS IN THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM TO SELECT CONVENTIONAL DELEGATES TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND LEGITIMACY IN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT DIVERSITY IN ELECTIVE BODIES BOOSTS PERCEPTIONS OF LEGITIMACY, PROPOSALS INCLUDED GENDER PARITY IN BOTH NOMINATIONS AND RESULTS, THE POSSIBILITY FOR INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES TO RUN IN LISTS, AND RESERVED SEATS FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THE RESULT WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY WITH 50% OF WOMEN, DELEGATES FROM TEN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, AND MANY INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES ELECTED. TIME WILL TELL IF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY MANAGES TO REBUILD CHILEANS' TRUST IN POLITICS.
517	THIS ARTICLE COMPARES THE EARLY PHASES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REDRAFTING PROCESSES IN VENEZUELA (1999) AND CURRENTLY IN CHILE (2021), SEEKING TO IDENTIFY KEY FACTORS THAT HELP EXPLAIN THE RADICAL CONSTITUTIONAL-REDRAFTING PATH THAT WAS FOLLOWED IN VENEZUELA, VERSUS THE MORE MODERATE, CONSENSUAL AND RULE-BOUNDED TRANSFORMATION UNDERWAY IN CHILE. WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE PRESENCE OF HUGO CHAVEZ AS LEADER OF A POPULIST PROJECT IN VENEZUELA-AN IMPORTANT FACTOR ABSENT IN TODAY'S CHILE-WHILST ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A HOST OF OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS THAT SITUATE THESE COUNTRIES' DIVERSE EXPERIENCES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE EXISTENCE OF UNADDRESSED HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL GRIEVANCES LEADING TO THE REFORM; FRUSTRATED EFFORTS AT OVERHAULING STATE INSTITUTIONS OR THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT; DISPARATE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS TO CHANNEL REFORM DEMANDS, AND DIFFERENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE RULING POLITICAL ELITES, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE AND NUANCED COMPARISON THAT NOT ONLY HELPS TO UNDERSTAND EACH CASE BETTER, BUT ALSO TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THE COMPLEX REASONS THAT LEAD TO CONSTITUTIONAL REDRAFTING IN TROUBLED DEMOCRACIES, WITH A VIEW TO INFORM OUR DEBATES ON THIS TOPIC BEYOND CHILE AND VENEZUELA.
518	AS A RESPONSE TO MASS MOBILIZATIONS AGAINST THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STATUS QUO, A MULTIPARTY AGREEMENT ACTIVATED A PROCESS TO REPLACE THE CONSTITUTION IN CHILE, THREE DECADES AFTER THE COUNTRY'S TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY. I ARGUE THAT THIS PROCESS HAS THREE FEATURES THAT ARE NOT ONLY DESIRABLE ON NORMATIVE GROUNDS BUT ALSO SHARED BY SUCCESSFUL EPISODES OF CONSTITUTIONAL REPLACEMENT IN DEMOCRATIC REGIMES: THE DRAFTING OF THE NEW TEXT IN AN ASSEMBLY BOUND BY PREEXISTING RULES, INCLUSIVE MECHANISMS OF REPRESENTATION AND DECISION MAKING, AND DIRECT CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT. THESE FEATURES, IN INTERACTION WITH THE POPULAR REPUDIATION OF THE ELITE-BIASED INSTITUTIONS INHERITED FROM THE PINOCHET ERA, MIGHT LEAD TO A NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT THAT DEEPENS DEMOCRATIZATION BY EXPANDING CITIZEN RIGHTS, STRENGTHENING EXECUTIVE CONSTRAINTS, AND REMOVING RESTRICTIONS ON MAJORITY RULE. YET THE REALIZATION OF THE FULL DEMOCRATIC POTENTIAL OF THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE DEPENDS ON THE STILL UNCERTAIN ABILITY OF CONSTITUTION MAKERS TO COMPROMISE ON A TEXT THAT IS NOT ONLY SEEN AS LEGITIMATE AMONG ORDINARY CITIZENS BUT ALSO PROMOTES COHERENT GOALS, EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONS, AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.
519	THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL OVERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF NORTH'S WORK ON INSTITUTIONS AND ECONOMIC CHANGE, FOCUSING ON ASPECTS OF HIS WORK THAT ARE OF INTEREST TO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARS. IT EXAMINES NORTH'S APPROACH TO INSTITUTIONS THROUGH HIS HISTORICAL WORK FOCUSING ON HIS CONCEPT OF CREDIBLE COMMITMENT AND HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE EFFECT OF THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION ON PROPERTY RIGHTS, FOCUSING ESPECIALLY ON THE ROLE HE ASSIGNS TO PROPERTY RIGHTS IN BRINGING ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. THE PAPER ALSO EXAMINES NORTH'S THEORY OF INSTITUTIONS FOCUSING ON THREE MAIN ISSUES: THE PERVASIVE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS; THE FOCUS ON AN END-POINT MODEL BASED ON SUCCESSFUL WESTERN ECONOMIES; AND THE FAILURE ADEQUATELY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGE. FINALLY, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF LAW IN NORTH'S THEORY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER IS TO CLARIFY WHETHER LAW, ACCORDING TO NORTH IS A PROTAGONIST IN THE PROCESS OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE OR IS MERELY A BY-PRODUCT OF CHANGES TAKING PLACE ELSEWHERE IN SOCIETY.
520	UNIVERSAL PROVISION OF LEGAL IDENTITY, MOST COMMONLY BIRTH REGISTRATION, IS VIEWED AS BOTH AN INTRINSIC HUMAN RIGHT AND AN INSTRUMENTAL DEVELOPMENT NECESSITY. LEGAL IDENTITY IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CITIZEN ACCESS TO CERTAIN BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES, PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND GENERATION OF VITAL STATISTICS TO INFORM DEVELOPMENT PLANNING. RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN NEPAL, CAMBODIA, AND BANGLADESH DEMONSTRATES THAT SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES TO OBTAINING LEGAL IDENTITY INCLUDE FINANCIAL AND PROCEDURAL BARRIERS, DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AND POLICIES, INSTITUTIONAL INCAPACITY, AND CITIZENS' LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND MOTIVATION. ROBUST ALTERNATIVE MARKETS FOR LEGAL IDENTITY REVEAL THE TRUE PUBLIC DEMAND FOR IDENTITY DOCUMENTS. IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY CONTEXT, THE PROVISION OF LEGAL IDENTITY ALONE DOES NOT NECESSARILY DELIVER DESIRED DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES. THUS, UNIVERSAL CIVIL REGISTRATION IS A NECESSARY AND WORTHY GOAL, BUT FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON THE ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT GOALS BEHIND UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION.
521	LEGAL PROBLEMS AND JUSTICE NEEDS ARE SIMILAR IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AND DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. PROCESSES FOR RESOLVING THEM, AS WELL AS RULES DETERMINING OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, VARY WIDELY. MEASURING THE PRICE (COSTS) AND QUALITY OF SUCH 'PATHS TO JUSTICE' FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE USER IS LIKELY TO ENHANCE USERS' CHOICE, ENABLE COMPARISON AND LEARNING, TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY, AND TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE CONTOURS OF A METHODOLOGY FOR THIS PURPOSE AND OF SOME CONCRETE TOOLS FOR MEASURING COSTS, PROCEDURAL QUALITY, AND OUTCOME QUALITY. CONCEPTUALIZATION OF A PATH TO JUSTICE, CRITERIA AND ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT FRAMEWORK, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT DATA COLLECTION METHODS, ARE PRESENTED. EXPERIENCES FROM TWO PILOT STUDIES GIVE INSIGHT INTO THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD, AND IN THE POTENTIAL USES OF THE (DEVELOPING) MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY.
522	MILITARY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)-ENABLED TECHNOLOGY MIGHT STILL BE IN THE RELATIVELY FLEDGLING STAGES BUT THE DEBATE ON HOW TO REGULATE ITS USE IS ALREADY IN FULL SWING. MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION REVOLVES AROUND AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS SYSTEMS (AWS) AND THE 'RESPONSIBILITY GAP' THEY WOULD OSTENSIBLY PRODUCE. THIS CONTRIBUTION ARGUES THAT WHILE SOME MILITARY AI TECHNOLOGIES MAY INDEED CAUSE A RANGE OF CONCEPTUAL HURDLES IN THE REALM OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY, THEY DO NOT RAISE ANY UNIQUE ISSUES UNDER THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY. THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE LATTER REGIME AND MAPS OUT CRUCIAL JUNCTIONS IN APPLYING IT TO POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CORNERSTONE OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) - THE PRINCIPLE OF DISTINCTION - RESULTING FROM THE USE OF AI-ENABLED MILITARY TECHNOLOGIES. IT REVEALS THAT ANY CHALLENGES IN ASCRIBING RESPONSIBILITY IN CASES INVOLVING AWS WOULD NOT BE CAUSED BY THE INCORPORATION OF AI, BUT STEM FROM PRE-EXISTING SYSTEMIC SHORTCOMINGS OF IHL AND THE UNCLEAR REVERBERATIONS OF MISTAKES THEREUNDER. THE ARTICLE REITERATES THAT STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EFFECTS OF AWS DEPLOYMENT IS ALWAYS RETAINED THROUGH THE COMMANDER'S ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY TO AUTHORISE WEAPON DEPLOYMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH IHL. IT IS PROPOSED, HOWEVER, THAT SHOULD THE SO-CALLED FULLY AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS - THAT IS, MACHINE LEARNING-BASED LETHAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF CHANGING THEIR OWN RULES OF OPERATION BEYOND A PREDETERMINED FRAMEWORK - EVER BE FIELDED, IT MIGHT BE FAIRER TO ATTRIBUTE THEIR CONDUCT TO THE FIELDING STATE, BY CONCEPTUALISING THEM AS STATE AGENTS, AND TREAT THEM AKIN TO STATE ORGANS.
523	SINCE THE 2015 ELECTIONS, POLAND HAS ENJOYED' THE ATTENTION OF SOCIAL SCIENCESPOLITICAL SCIENCE IN PARTICULARTO AN EXTENT GREATER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE PERIOD OF SOLIDARITY IN THE EARLY 1980S. IN CONTRAST TO THAT PERIOD, POLAND'S IDIOSYNCRATIC DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO PLAY THE FUNCTION OF A NORMATIVE ROLE MODEL. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN POLAND IN RECENT TIMES DEVOLVE INTO TWO STORIES: ONE OF PROFOUND CIVILIZATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO THE 2015 ELECTIONS; THE OTHER OF AN UNEXPECTED AND SUDDEN SHIFT TOWARD THE DISMANTLING OF THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AFTER THE LAW AND JUSTICE (PIS) PARTY CAME TO POWER IN LATE 2015. THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF PRE-2015 POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN POLAND AND IDENTIFIES KEY DETERMINANTS OF VOTE CHOICE IN THE 2015 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION IN POLAND. IN BRIEF, THIS ANALYSIS SHOWS TWO THINGS: THAT THERE WAS NO DEMAND' FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE AT THESE ELECTIONS, AND THAT SUPPORT FOR THE WINNING PARTY WAS MAINLY DETERMINED BY SOCIO-CULTURAL FACTORS RATHER THAN ECONOMIC ONES. THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHY THE PIS GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF POLITICAL ACTION THAT VIOLATES BOTH THE ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND CONCRETE, BINDING PROVISIONS OF POLAND'S 1997 CONSTITUTION. SEVERAL THEORETICAL AND SPECULATIVE IDEAS ARE OFFERED IN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.
524	PRESENTLY, THE VIETNAMESE STATE IS FACING TWO CHALLENGES. ON THE ONE HAND, IT HAS TO INTEGRATE THE COUNTRY INTO THE FREE WORLD MARKET AND ITS COROLLARY OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PROSPERITY TO ITS PEOPLE AND TO PRESERVE ITS LEGITIMACY. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT HAS TO DEAL WITH THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS FORCES, WHICH IT SUSPECTS TO EMBODY OPPOSITION AGAINST THE ABSOLUTE POWER IT HAS EXERCISED SINCE ITS VICTORY AFTER 30 YEARS OF WAR. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE VIETNAMESE RELIGIOUS POLICY AND THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S (VCP) APPROACH TO RELIGION FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. IS THE VCP'S POLICY THE RESULT OF A PRINCIPLED APPROACH BY A STRONG STATE BASED ON AN IMMUTABLE ATHEIST IDEOLOGY OR THE RESULT OF A PRAGMATIC APPROACH BY A STATE LOOKING FOR LEGITIMACY AND REGIONAL AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION? THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW A DIFFICULT CONTEXT OF A LONG STATE OF WAR FOLLOWED BY ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION HAVE PRODUCED A SPECIFIC VIETNAMESE APPROACH TO RELIGIOUS POLICY. IT ANALYSES THE PROCESS LED BY THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST STATE TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION IN RELIGIOUS MATTERS BASED ON COMMUNIST MODELS (SOVIET, CHINESE), ON LEGACIES OF MORE ANCIENT MODELS SUCH AS THE CHINESE CONFUCIAN POLICY OF RELIGIOUS CONTROL, ON ITS OWN HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES, BUT ALSO ON MORE RECENT WESTERN MODELS. WHILE FOLLOWING COMMUNIST 'ANTI-RELIGION' MODELS, VIETNAM'S POLICY HAS NEVERTHELESS BEEN EQUALLY DICTATED BY CONSIDERATIONS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LEGITIMACY, AS WELL AS BY ECONOMIC REASONS.
525	IN RECENT YEARS, THE ASIA FOUNDATION (THE FOUNDATION) HAS CONDUCTED A SERIES OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE INDEXES (EGIS) IN COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT SOUTH AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA INCLUDING BANGLADESH, SRI LANKA, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, AND INDONESIA. EGIS ARE COUNTRY-SPECIFI C DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS USED TO ASSESS AND RANK SUB-NATIONAL UNITS (PROVINCES, STATES, DISTRICTS, ETC.) ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE BASIC THEORETICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC RATIONALE FOR THE EGI. THE OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THIS TOOL STEMS FROM THE IDEA THAT ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IMPACTS PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT - INDEPENDENT OF STRUCTURAL ENDOWMENTS SUCH AS LOCATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND HUMAN CAPITAL. THEREFORE, GOOD ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE PRACTICES EXPLAIN WHY SOME SUB-NATIONAL UNITS OUT-PERFORM OTHERS IN SPITE OF HAVING SIMILAR INITIAL ENDOWMENTS. EGIS HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO PROVIDE RELEVANT ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE INFORMATION TO POLICY MAKERS, BUSINESS LEADERS AND CITIZENS. EXAMINING THE METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE INDEX APPROACH, THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES HOW THE THREE PRIMARY EGI METHODOLOGICAL ELEMENTS ANTICIPATE POTENTIAL PITFALLS AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED WITHIN THE METHODOLOGY.
526	HISTORICAL RESEARCH REPRESENTS OUR RICHEST VEIN OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF LEGAL PLURALISM. BEFORE THE LONG NINETEENTH CENTURY, ALL LEGAL ORDERS FEATURED JURISDICTIONAL TENSIONS WITHOUT STRONG CLAIMS OF LEGAL HEGEMONY BY STATES. IN A WORLD IN WHICH PLURAL LEGAL ORDERS WERE THE NORM, MULTICENTRIC JURISDICTIONAL ORDERS CREATED CONTINUITIES ACROSS DIVERSE REGIONS AND POLITIES. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THE HISTORY OF LEGAL PLURALISM IN CONSIDERING ITS RELATION TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TODAY? TO BEGIN, LEGAL HISTORY CAN PROVIDE AN ANALYTIC GUIDE TO GRASPING THE COMPLEXITIES OF CURRENT LEGAL PATTERNS AND BEHAVIOR. A PARTICULARLY HELPFUL RUBRIC EMERGES OUT OF STUDIES OF THE LEGAL HISTORY OF EMPIRES. A SECOND RELEVANT FINDING CONFIRMED BY HISTORICAL STUDIES OF PLURAL LEGAL ORDERS, INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY EMPIRES, CONSISTS IN THE OBSERVATION THAT LEGAL ACTORS - AGAIN, AT ALL LEVELS - TENDED TO SHOW A PREFERENCE OVER TIME FOR ADJUDICATION IN FORUMS THAT SEEMED TO PROVIDE A GREATER POSSIBILITY OF ENFORCEMENT OF RULINGS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THESE PHENOMENA IN EARLY MODERN SOCIETIES IN ORDER TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR ANALYZING LEGAL PLURALISM IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES. BY KEEPING IN VIEW THE JURISDICTIONAL JOCKEYING OF IMPERIAL LEGAL ORDERS, WE GAIN NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE ROLE OF LEGAL PLURALISM AT MAJOR TURNING POINTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. IN PARTICULAR, IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND NINETEENTH CENTURY PROHIBITION REGIMES AS FORMING THROUGH JURISDICTIONAL RESTRUCTURING WITHIN AND ACROSS GLOBAL EMPIRES - A VIEW THAT CONTRASTS WITH TRADITIONAL NARRATIVES OF THE RISE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. SIMILARLY, UNDERSTANDING THE PERVASIVENESS AND PERSISTENCE OF STRATEGIES OF APPEALING TO IMPERIAL LEGAL AUTHORITY ALLOWS US TO APPRECIATE THE EFFECTS ON LEGAL BEHAVIOR OF ROBUST CLAIMS TO THE DOMINANCE OF STATE LAW OVER SUBORDINATE JURISDICTIONS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.
527	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH A NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF POLAND'S CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL: THE TRIBUNAL'S FINDING THAT ART. 6 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS INCOMPATIBLE TO SOME EXTENT WITH THE POLISH CONSTITUTION. THE TRIBUNAL RULED THUS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS JUDGMENT OF 24 NOVEMBER 2021 IN CASE REF. K 6/21 IN A REACTION TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS JUDGMENT IN THE CASE OF XERO FLOR V. POLAND (APPLICATION NO. 4907/18). THE ARTICLE CRITIQUES THIS JUDGMENT BOTH FROM THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. I ARGUE THAT CONTRARY TO THE INTENTION OF THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL, WHO IS ALSO THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND WHO INITIATED THE PROCEEDINGS LEADING TO THIS JUDGMENT, THIS JUDGMENT DOES NOT AFFECT THE OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE THE XERO FLOR JUDGMENT. AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL, IN COMMENTED JUDGMENT, FAILS TO FULFIL ONE OF ITS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS, PROTECTING CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, THIS JUDGMENT SHOULD BE PERCEIVED AS PROOF OF THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR INTERNAL POLITICAL PURPOSES. THIS RULING, HOWEVER, FORMED THE BASIS FOR A NEW LINE OF JURISPRUDENCE, AS THE CONVENTION WAS AGAIN CHALLENGED BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL BY THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL IN REACTION TO SUBSEQUENT ECTHR JUDGMENTS. CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL IN ITS JUDGMENT OF 10 MARCH 2022 IN CASE REF. K 7/21 RULED AGAIN ON EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS INCOMPATIBILITY WITH POLISH CONSTITUTION.
528	EXECUTIVE LAWLESSNESS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR SOURCES OF THE CRISIS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN AFRICA. AFTER A 9 YEAR TENURE MARKED BY ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AND COMPLICITY IN THE CAPTURE OF THE STATE BY AN INDIAN BUSINESS FAMILY, THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT, JACOB ZUMA WAS FORCED TO RESIGN ON 14 FEBRUARY 2018. THIS CAME HARD ON THE HEELS OF THE RARE AND BOLD DECISION BY THE KENYAN SUPREME COURT IN SEPTEMBER 2017, TO DECLARE NULL AND VOID THE RESULTS OF A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT RESULTED IN THE INCUMBENT'S WINNING A SECOND TERM. MEANWHILE, IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, DOZENS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN PROTESTS AS JOSEPH KABILA REFUSES TO STEP DOWN OR HOLD ELECTIONS AFTER THE END OF HIS SECOND AND FINAL TERM, CLAIMING THAT THIS IS DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS AND LOGISTICAL OBSTACLES SUCH AS AN INCOMPLETE AND UNRELIABLE ELECTORAL ROLL. THESE AND NUMEROUS OTHER RECENT EVENTS HAVE NOT ONLY CALLED INTO QUESTION THE PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINING THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION FROM THE CORRUPT, REPRESSIVE AND INCOMPETENT AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE OF YESTERYEAR THAT AFRICA BEGAN TO WITNESS IN THE 1990S. MORE PERTINENTLY, THIS HAS RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS IN THE CONSTITUTIONS THAT AFRICAN STATES REVISED OR ADOPTED IN THE 1990S AND THEREAFTER, ARE SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE FOR CHECKING THE CONTINENT'S UNRULY EXECUTIVES? AFRICA'S 'BIG MEN' AND THEIR CRONIES ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR INSATIABLE CAPACITY TO MISUSE THEIR PRIVILEGED POSITIONS TO ENRICH THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUPPORTERS ALMOST WITH IMPUNITY. THE ZUMA CASE, HOWEVER, UNDERSCORES JUST HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO ENFORCE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT ALL CITIZENS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS, ARE NOT ONLY EQUAL BEFORE, AND BOUND TO OBEY AND ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, BUT THAT THE LAW ALSO APPLIES TO ALL WITHOUT FEAR, FAVOUR OR PREJUDICE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES, FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE, THE MANNER IN WHICH ATTEMPTS ARE BEING MADE TO ENSURE THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, ESPECIALLY PRESIDENTS, ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND INACTIONS. THE ISSUE OF EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY IS SITUATED WITHIN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE EXTENSIVE POWERS USUALLY CONFERRED ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THE OPERATION OF TWO MAIN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS AND INSTITUTIONS TO CHECK AGAINST ABUSES OF EXECUTIVE POWER: HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESSES AND VERTICAL ONES, ADOPTED IN AFRICAN JURISDICTIONS, ARE CRITICALLY REVIEWED. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT, IN SPITE OF THE NUMEROUS INNOVATIVE MEASURES AND INSTITUTIONS INTRODUCED TO CHECK ABUSE OF POWERS IN AFRICA, EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY IS GENERALLY IN DECLINE. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SUSTAIN THE TRANSITION TO TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE SYSTEMS OF GOVERNANCE ON THE CONTINENT.
529	INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY SELF-FINANCING IN THE LAST DECADES, WITH VALUABLE NATURAL RESOURCES FIGURING AMONG THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF CONFLICT FUNDING. IN ORDER TO END THESE ARMED CONFLICTS, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS DEVELOPED SEVERAL INSTRUMENTS TARGETING THEIR FUNDING, MOST NOTABLY BY CURBING THE ILLEGAL TRADE IN NATURAL RESOURCES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TWO OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, I.E. THE KIMBERLEY PROCESS FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF ROUGH DIAMONDS (KPCS) AND THE OECD DUE DILIGENCE GUIDANCE FOR RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAINS OF MINERALS FROM CONFLICT-AFFECTED AND HIGH-RISK AREAS (OECD GUIDANCE). MORE IN PARTICULAR, IT ANALYSES THE MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS TO STOP THE TRADE IN CONFLICT RESOURCES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE GOVERNANCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AS A TOOL FOR THE PREVENTION OF NEW CONFLICTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT EVEN THOUGH THE KPCS AND THE OECD GUIDANCE DO NOT IMPOSE LEGALLY BINDING OBLIGATIONS UPON THEIR PARTICIPANTS, THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES TO ENFORCE THESE INSTRUMENTS. IN ORDER TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ENFORCEABILITY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THESE INSTRUMENTS AS PART OF THE BROADER POLITICAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. IN ADDITION, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE INSTRUMENTS, NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR NON-BINDING CHARACTER DO HAVE RELEVANCE FOR THE FORMATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN RELATION TO THE GOVERNANCE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. BOTH INSTRUMENTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SETTING STANDARDS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND, IN THIS WAY, REFLECT A GROWING CONSENSUS ON HOW NATURAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE MANAGED.
530	A 'SQUATTER' IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH IS ANOTHER WORD FOR A SEEMINGLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE HEAP OF LEGAL AMBIGUITIES, MESSY POLITICS AND ABJECT POVERTY. SQUATTER DWELLERS ARE TYPICALLY IMMIGRANTS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE, WHO SQUAT ON SEIZED LAND AND ARE CAUGHT IN COMPLEX MAZES OF CITIZENSHIP, LABOR AND PROPERTY LAWS. THEY ARE SUSPENDED IN WHAT I CALL 'JURIDICAL LIMBO' A SITUATION IN WHICH OVERLAPPING LEGAL IDENTITIES AND CONTRADICTORY LAWS RENDER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES INTO A STATE OF SEMI-LEGAL EXISTENCE. MANY SQUATTERS HAVE FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE LEGAL ARENA AND ARE VULNERABLE TO BEING EVICTED WITHOUT PROPER REHABILITATION, BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE INDEED LEARNT TO USE THE LAW'S COMPLICATIONS TO THEIR EXTRALEGAL ADVANTAGE. USING THE CASE OF TWO EXTRAORDINARY LAND CONFLICTS IN INDIA'S MOST POPULOUS CITY CALCUTTA THIS PAPER CONTRASTS THE CLAIM MAKING STRATEGIES OF TWO SQUATTER SETTLEMENTS, PROVIDING A RICH ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF THEIR DIFFERENTIAL SUCCESS IN PROTECTING THEIR TERRITORY AGAINST EVICTION AND OF NAVIGATING THEIR SEMI-LEGAL STATUS. ALONGSIDE ESTABLISHING THIS VARIATION, THIS PAPER ALSO INTERROGATES THE PROXIMATE CAUSES OF THIS VARIATION AND PUTS FORTH A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT FOCUSES ON THE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE URBAN POOR.
531	THE PROTRACTED CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CHINESE STATE AND HONG KONG SOCIETY OVER THE PACE AND FORM OF DEMOCRATIZATION HAVE BECOME A SOURCE OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS NEW LIGHT ON THESE DYNAMICS BY ANALYZING THE TWO SIDES AS LOCKED IN A COORDINATION DILEMMA: BOTH HAVE IMPORTANT COMMON INTERESTS TO COORDINATE WITH EACH OTHER, BUT BOTH RANK IN DIVERGENT WAYS THEIR PREFERENCES FOR AND AGAINST INTRODUCING COMPETITIVE ELECTORAL ARRANGEMENTS INTO HONG KONG. IT IS SHOWN HOW THE UNWILLINGNESS OF EITHER SIDE TO COMPROMISE HAS CAUSED THE GRADUAL BREAKDOWN OF COORDINATION AS FOCAL POINTS LIKE THE BASIC LAW HAVE ERODED, CULMINATING IN THE UMBRELLA REVOLUTION OF 2014, THE LARGEST AND LONGEST-LASTING POPULAR MOVEMENT IN HONG KONG HISTORY. THE BLOODLESS ENDING OF THE MOVEMENT IS CHRONICLED, ALONG WITH THE PERSISTENCE OF POLITICAL STALEMATE IN THIS HIGHLY ANOMALOUS POLITY, KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD FOR ITS COMBINATION OF GENUINE CIVIL LIBERTIES WITH AUTHORITARIAN RULE.
532	A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR CHINA IS THE FREQUENCY OF SO-CALLED 'MASS INCIDENTS' OR PROTESTS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE IN RECENT YEARS. MANY SUCH INCIDENTS ARE THE RESULT OF FORCED EXPROPRIATION OF FARMLAND BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE GOAL OF INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES FACED BY RURAL CITIZENS TO ACCESS FORMAL SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE WHILE SEEKING A LEGAL REMEDY. WHY ARE FORMAL SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE NOT EFFECTIVE IN SETTLING DISPUTES ON LAND EXPROPRIATION IN CHINA? WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES FACED BY LANDLESS FARMERS IN ACCESSING JUSTICE, AND HOW CAN SUCH OBSTACLES BE OVERCOME? WE EXAMINE EXISTING REGULATIONS FOR SETTLING COMPENSATION DISPUTES IN CHINA AND DISCUSS SEVERAL CONCRETE EXAMPLES FROM THE FIELD IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. THESE INCLUDE A VERY DEMANDING APPLICANT REQUIREMENT, AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS SUCH AS NO TIME LIMIT FOR COMPULSORY MEDIATION, AND THE INABILITY OF THE PETITIONS SYSTEM TO ADDRESS LAND DISPUTE CASES. WE ARGUE THAT THE ADJUDICATION SYSTEM ITSELF IS AN OBSTACLE FOR FARMERS WHO WISH TO SEEK AN ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGAL REMEDY. THE POLITICAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES IN CHINA PREFER THE MAINTENANCE OF STRICT AND SPECIFIC NORMS RATHER THAN FACILITATING MORE ADAPTABLE AND FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES. WITHOUT A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF CURRENT DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS, THE NUMBER AND FREQUENCY OF SEVERE SOCIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN FARMERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE. MAJOR REFORMS ARE REQUIRED TO BETTER PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF LANDLESS FARMERS AND OTHER CITIZENS WHOSE PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN EXPROPRIATED.
533	THE PAPER DISCUSS CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM IN CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPE BUT ESPECIALLY IN POLAND. AFTER REVIEW OF LITERATURE WHICH USE LABEL "POPULISM" WITHOUT ANY ANALYSES THE PAPER LOOK AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES AS THE THIRD MOMENT IN REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS WHICH STARTED IN 1980.
534	IN THIS ARTICLE THE QUALITATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ARE ANALYZED AS THEY APPLY TO THE USE OF 'IMSI-CATCHERS' - A TECHNICAL DEVICE TO TRACK THE LOCATION AND USE OF CELL PHONES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMSI-CATCHERS IN THE SWEDISH POLICE IS USED AS A CASE STUDY AND LITMUS TEST TO ILLUSTRATE HOW DOMESTIC LAW MAY INTERACT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER CONVENTION LAW IN THIS AREA. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE SWEDISH IMPLEMENTATION OF IMSI-CATCHERS IN SUBSTANTIVE LAW HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE ACTUAL USE OF THE MEASURE IN POLICE WORK THROUGH REFERENCES TO THE DOMESTIC LEGAL PRINCIPLE THAT 'THE ETHER IS FREE' THAT SERVE TO PRECLUDE LEGAL PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY OF RADIO COMMUNICATIONS. THE APPLICATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE HIGHLIGHTS DEFICIENCIES IN THE CONFORMITY OF SWEDISH LAW WITH BOTH THE EU EPRIVACY DIRECTIVE AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION.

535	RECENT LITERATURE HAS POINTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCALIZING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN ORDER TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THEIR EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. IN THIS CONTEXT ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID MAINLY TO CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS, BUT NOT AS MUCH TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES. WHAT ROLE CAN LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES PLAY IN ENFORCING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THE PAPER STARTS WITH AN INDUCTIVE APPROACH. IT IDENTIFIES AND DESCRIBES SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF HOW LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES (LRAS) WITHIN THE EU MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS SEVEN EXAMPLES, FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITHIN THE EU, OF HOW LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES CAN STRENGTHEN THE ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. NEXT, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO DEVELOP A MORE GENERAL TYPOLOGY OF THE DIFFERENT ROLES LRAS CAN PLAY IN THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IT IDENTIFIES FOUR DISTINCTIVE ROLES LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES CAN PLAY. FIRST THEY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THROUGH MONITORING AS A RULE INTERMEDIARY. SECOND, THROUGH BUDGET ALLOCATION AND SERVICE PROVISION THEY CAN ENCOURAGE INITIATIVES FROM OTHER ACTORS TO REINFORCE THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THIRD, THEY CAN SUPPORT HIGHER LEVEL GOVERNANCE POLICIES THROUGH AWARENESS-RAISING. FINALLY, THEY CAN PLAY A COORDINATING ROLE, BRINGING TOGETHER SEVERAL ACTORS TO ENFORCE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IN A THIRD PART, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO THE QUESTION OF HOW THE IMPACT OF THESE ROLES CAN BE STRENGTHENED, AND SEVERAL PROPOSALS ARE PRESENTED. WE END WITH A SHORT CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
536	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES SOVEREIGNTY AS A BASIC ARGUMENT TO JUSTIFY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT (EAW) INTO INTERNAL LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE MEMBER STATES. THE FIRST TWO PARTS DEAL WITH A CONFLICT BETWEEN EXTRADITION AND THE EAW, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF SOVEREIGNTY ON THE BINDING FORCE OF LEGAL RULES. WE AGREE WITH MACCORMICK WHEN HE SAYS THAT THE MERGING OF DIFFERENT LEGAL ORDERS, INCLUDING CIVIL LAW SYSTEMS AND COMMON LAW SYSTEM, AND THAT VERTICAL INTERFERENCE OF COMMUNITY LAW INTO INTERNAL LAW OF ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE LEAD TO THE DEPARTURE FROM A CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN ITS TRADITIONAL MEANING AND TO PROPAGATION OF THE IDEA OF COMPULSORY EXISTENCE OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL MONISM. CONCEPTUAL EXTENSION AND DEFENCE OF THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM ARE OFFERED INSTEAD, AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUAL STATES AND THE UNION ITSELF. THE EAW IS A MEASURE WHICH, IMPOSING LIMITATIONS ON TRADITIONALLY UNDERSTOOD IUS PUNIENDI OF SOVEREIGN STATES, MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO PROSECUTE INTERNATIONAL CRIME IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAN THAT OF EXTRADITION. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EAW PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE STATES' WILLINGNESS TO REDUCE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IN RESPECT OF THE CREATION OF CRIMINAL LAW IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GENERALLY ACCEPTED GOAL. ALTHOUGH THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE CONCERNING THE SUPREMACY OF COMMUNITY LAW OF HAS BEEN CLEAR, THE PRACTICE OF STATES SHOWS THAT ARGUMENTS OF SOVEREIGNTY, IN ITS BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE ASPECTS, HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY APPLIED. THE THIRD PART CONTAINS DESCRIPTION AND COMPARISON OF ARGUMENTS FROM SOVEREIGNTY WHICH PROVIDED A BASIS FOR JUDGMENTS OF THE POLISH AND GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS. IN JUDGMENT P 1/05 OF 27 APRIL 2005, THE POLISH COURT (CALLED THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL) FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 607T OF THE POLISH CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IMPLEMENTING THE FRAMEWORK DECISION. AS A BASIS FOR THAT DECISION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL INDICATED ARTICLE 55 OF POLAND'S CONSTITUTION WHICH FORBIDS EXTRADITION OF A POLISH CITIZEN. THE TRIBUNAL DELAYED THE LOSS OF BINDING FORCE OF THE CHALLENGED PROVISION FOR 18 MONTHS, BY WHICH IT INDICATED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT ARTICLE 9 OF THE CONSTITUTION OBLIGATES POLAND TO RESPECT INTERNATIONAL LAW BINDING UPON IT AND, THEREFORE, TO AMEND ITS CONSTITUTION.. THE NEW WORDING OF ARTICLE 55, ESTABLISHING THE REQUIREMENT OF DOUBLE CRIMINALITY, SHOWS THAT THE POLISH LEGISLATOR HAS NOT RECONCILED ITSELF WITH THE LOSS OF SOVEREIGNTY IN THE AREA OF PROSECUTION AND ADJUDICATING IN CASES OF POLISH CITIZENS. IN JUDGMENT 2 BVR 2236/04 OF 18 MAY 2005, THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL FOUND THE STATUTE IMPLEMENTING THE EAW NOT TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GERMAN BASIC LAW. THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM WAS IMPRECISE DEFINITION OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND PROCEDURES CONCERNING GERMAN CITIZENS WHO HAD COMMITTED CRIMINAL OFFENCES AND HAD NOT LEFT THE GERMAN TERRITORY IN RELATION TO WHICH HEY WERE PROSECUTED ABROAD. THE COURT DID NOT ALLOW TO CONTINUE IN FORCE, EVEN PARTLY, THE PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTING THE FRAMEWORK DECISION NOR IT PERMITTED INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS, BECAUSE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS, INCLUDING THE LEGALISM PRINCIPLE IN RESPECT OF GERMAN CITIZENS, WAS THE DUTY OF THE LEGISLATOR. IT ALSO HELD THAT AS LONG AS THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE DECISION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE BASIC LAW, THE EXTRADITION OF A GERMAN CITIZEN WAS INADMISSIBLE. ANOTHER ARGUMENT APPLIED IS NATIONAL IDENTITY, I. E. SUPREMACY OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY WHEN THE HIERARCHY OF LEGAL RULES IS DECIDED, PARTICULARLY IN CASES OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S BELONGING TO A GIVEN COMMUNITY AND THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES RELATED THERETO. THE LAST, BUT NOT LESS IMPORTANT ARGUMENT IS REFERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH REQUIRE THAT EACH LEGISLATIVE ACT, INCLUDING THAT IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY LAW, SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW TO EXAMINE IF IT MEETS BASIC STANDARDS. THE DECISIONS OF BOTH CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS DID NOT AVOID WEIGHTING OF STATE INTERESTS AND LEGALISM AND, THEREFORE, AN ARGUMENT FROM SOVEREIGNTY RAISES IN IMPORTANCE. THE TRADITION OF DOMESTIC LAW ASSUMES THE EXISTENCE OF A SOVEREIGN STATE, AN INTERNAL SYSTEM OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LINKS. IN THE FACE OF DYNAMIC CHANGES IN THIS AREA, AS A RESULT OF MORE INCREASING CONTACTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEGAL TRADITIONS, LAWYERS SHOULD DEPART FROM THE DOGMATIC FORMALISM AND TAKE A MORE RATIONAL VIEW ON THE ISSUE OF SOVEREIGNTY.
537	THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND UKRAINE IS A NEW FORMAT OF RELATIONS AIMED AT CREATING A DEEP AND COMPREHENSIVE FREE TRADE AREA (DCFTA) BETWEEN UKRAINE AND THE EU WITH THE GRADUAL INTEGRATION OF UKRAINE INTO THE INTERNAL MARKET OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. FOCUSING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF RULE-MAKING OF THE EU MEMBER STATES, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEFINE AND IMPLEMENT THE LEGAL RULES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE NATIONAL JUDICIARY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN LAW (CHORNOMAZ, 2016). IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STRATEGY OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION OF OUR COUNTRY, THE ADAPTATION OF UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION IS TO APPROXIMATE IT WITH THE MODERN EUROPEAN LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POLITICAL, ENTREPRENEURIAL, SOCIAL, CULTURAL ACTIVITY OF UKRAINIAN CITIZENS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE WITHIN THE EU TO FACILITATE THE INCREASE OF STANDARDS OF LIVING OF THE POPULATION. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATION PROVIDED BY THE ECONOMIC PART OF THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT (AA) IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF REFORMS, AS THE PROVISIONS CAN AND SHOULD SERVE AS A BASIS FOR A NEW MODEL OF SOCIO- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE. THE DEEPENING OF THE PROCESSES OF HUMANIZATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION OF UKRAINIAN SOCIETY, THE GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF EUROPEAN LAW INTO THE NATIONAL JUDICIARY THROUGH REFORMS IN THE FIELD OF JUSTICE, INTER ALIA, HAVE LED TO QUALITATIVE UPDATING OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE, IN PARTICULAR: USE OF DIFFERENTIATED APPROACH TO LEGAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN PERSONS WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMINAL OFFENCES, WHICH DO NOT POSE A GREAT PUBLIC DANGER, AND VICTIMS; SIMPLIFICATION AND REDUCTION OF THE PROCEDURE OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS; ENSURING PROCEDURAL SAVINGS; REDUCTION OF THE CASELOAD; ALLOWING THE PARTIES OF THE CONFLICT TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF EXEMPTION FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY IN CASE OF RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE OFFENDER AND THE VICTIM INDEPENDENTLY, THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEGOTIATED PUNISHMENT AND RELEASE FROM SERVING WITH PROBATION, ETC. GIVEN THE SPECIFICS OF THE APPROACH TO IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES ON A DIFFERENTIATED BASIS, THE EU SEEKS TO IDENTIFY AND BASE ON EXISTING POSITIVE SOURCES OF SUSTAINABILITY, AS WELL AS TO MONITOR AND RESPOND TO WEAKNESSES WITH THE APPROPRIATE SET OF METHODS AND RESOURCES AT ITS DISPOSAL. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO STUDY A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL DEFINITION OF CHALLENGES OF ADAPTATION OF UKRAINIAN LEGISLATION TO THE LEGISLATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, INSTITUTIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MECHANISMS OF DCFTA IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FIELD OF JUSTICE AND CERTAIN NORMS OF THE CURRENT CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION. UKRAINE IS UNDERGOING THE SECOND PHASE OF RADICAL REFORM OF GOVERNMENT STRUCTURES; IT HAS BEEN CONTINUING FOR 15 YEARS BUT, UNLIKE OTHER COUNTRIES, IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR UKRAINE TO GET RID OF THE BURDEN OF PAST PROBLEMS. JUDICIAL REFORM IS ALSO UNDERWAY AND DOMESTIC LEGISLATION IS BEING SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED, INCLUDING THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE TOPICAL ISSUE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL REFORMS IS AN IMPERFECTION, AND SOMETIMES A CONTRADICTION OF REGULATIONS, WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE PROCESS OF REALIZATION OF RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL SUBJECTS OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, SLOWS DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT OF UKRAINE AS A STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE INTRODUCTION OF INSTITUTIONS OF CONCLUDING AGREEMENTS, SIMPLIFIED PROCEEDINGS, PROBATION, AND LATER MEDIATION, INTO THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE INDICATES THE READINESS OF OUR STATE TO CHANGE THE CONCEPT OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS, WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE SITUATION OF ALL PARTIES TO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. HOWEVER, THEY NEED FURTHER COMPLETION AND IMPROVEMENT. WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH INSTITUTIONS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE LEGAL DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY TO ACHIEVE THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE, WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE THE FURTHER INTRODUCTION OF THE LATTER IN THE LEGISLATION OF UKRAINE, RESOLVING CRIMINAL CONFLICTS BY REACHING A COMPROMISE BETWEEN PARTIES IN CASES SPECIFIED BY LAW. ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN UKRAINE IS TO REGULATE THE PROCESS OF ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS BY THE SUBJECTS OF RULE-MAKING AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PROVISION THAT LEGALITY AS AN OBJECTIVE PROPERTY OF LAW, IN GENERAL, IS THE NECESSARY CONDITION AND THE MAIN PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE-MAKING PROCESS.
538	THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE INSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL SECRETARIAT THAT PLANS AND SUPPORTS EU CIVILIAN PEACE OPERATIONS. DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY IN THE LATE 1990S COMPETING POLITICAL PRIORITIES OF BIG EU MEMBER STATES AND A DOMINANCE OF MILITARY STRUCTURES PUT CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATORS AT A SIGNIFICANT DISADVANTAGE. BETWEEN 2003 AND 2007, HOWEVER, THE RISING NUMBER AND COMPLEXITY OF CIVILIAN MISSIONS GENERATED PRESSURE FOR REFORM, WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE CREATION OF A CIVILIAN HEADQUARTERS. THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR ASSESSING THE EU'S CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES FOR CIVILIAN CRISIS MANAGEMENT. WHILE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY DEFICITS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, INCREASED INSTITUTIONAL FORMALIZATION AND FURTHER POLITICALLY MOTIVATED REFORMS MAY INCREASE TENSIONS AND HAMPER THE ACCUMULATION OF EXPERTISE.
539	RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS AS A CONSTITUENT PART OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS ARE THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF SOCIAL RELATIONS FOR LEGAL REGULATION, THEORETICAL CONCEPT AND SYSTEMATISATION AS WELL AS FOR THEIR PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT IN A COMMUNITY AND STATE. IN SPITE OF THEIR IMPORTANCE, THERE ARE AT ALL LEVELS QUITE A FEW DISAGREEMENTS OR IN OTHER WORDS, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED AIMING AT UNIQUE, GENERAL SOLUTIONS BOTH AT THEORETICAL AND PROVISIONAL (LEGISLATIVE) LEVEL. IT SHOULD SUFFICE TO MENTION THAT THERE IS NO AGREEMENT ON THE DEFINITION OF THE NOTION OF NATIONAL MINORITY OR ON THE QUESTION WHETHER RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES BELONG TO THEIR MEMBER INDIVIDUALS OR/AND NATIONAL MINORITY AS A COLLECTIVITY. NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE OBJECTS OF LEGAL REGULATION OF SUPRANATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAWS BECAUSE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND THE ROLE IN ESTABLISHING STABLE AND SECURE SOCIETIES AS A LINK AMONG NATIONS AND STATES, THEIR EXPANSION AND THE DIALOGUE, UNDERSTANDING, TOLERANCE AND CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT OF INSTRUMENTS TO SOLVE ALL SOCIAL (INTERSTATE) TENSIONS, INCLUDING OPEN CONFLICTS BY MEANS OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES AND VALUES OF JUSTICE, FREEDOM AND EQUALITY, ALONG WITH RESPECT AND PROTECTION OF THEIR RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AS HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS BASED ON BEST PRACTICES OF STATES, RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION. INDEED, ALL THIS SHOULD BE DONE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE NATIONAL, WITHIN THE NORMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TO REGULATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER HAS NOT TAKEN IT OVER FROM THE SUPRANATIONAL LAW (AS IN CROATIA), AND THEIR LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ELABORATING THE CONTENT OF ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF NATIONAL MINORITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS. THE LONG YEAR ENDEAVOUR OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA (SINCE ITS INDEPENDENCE) TO REGULATE THE ISSUES OF NATIONAL MINORITIES ENDED IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY (FROM 2000 UNTIL 2003) FIRST OF ALL BASED ON ITS CONSTITUTION, THEN ON THE CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND THE FRAMEWORK CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES. THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF LEGAL REGULATION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA HAVE BEEN RATED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN EUROPE, AMONG MANY EU MEMBER STATES I.E. IN THE WORLD AND HAVE RECEIVED THE INCENTIVE AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECTION IN REAL SOCIAL LIFE. MOREOVER, THESE ISSUES ONCE CONSTITUTED THE BASIS OF TENSIONS AND EXCUSES FOR THE SERBIAN NATIONAL MINORITY IN CROATIA AND AS JUSTIFICATION FOR GREAT-SERBIAN ASPIRATION TOWARDS THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA EVEN BY MEANS OF MILITARY AGGRESSION. THESE ISSUES MOTIVATE SENSITIVE HANDLING OF ALL SERIOUS INTERVENTIONS IN LEGAL ORDER AND PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF NATIONAL MINORITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR OF THOSE AFFECTING THE CHANGES IN CONSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES AND CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF THE STATE AND COMMUNITY ON ONE HAND AND ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY OF CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER ON THE OTHER HAND. THE AIMS OF THE SIXTH "PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA" ARE THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES. THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT ONLY CHANGE THE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER BY CHANGING CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF LEGISLATION (CONSTITUTION AND THE LAWS) BY WHICH RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES AND THEIR MEMBERS ARE REGULATED BY RAISING THEM FROM THE LEVEL OF ORGANIC LAWS TO THE LEVEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS AND CONSTITUTIONAL ACTS, BUT (IF ADOPTED AND PASSED) IT CREATES CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS ON WHICH CIVIL PRINCIPLE IS ADOPTED AS A CONSTITUENT OF THE CROATIAN SOCIETY CHANGING THE ETHNICAL PRINCIPLE BY ESTABLISHING DIFFERENT RELATIONS BETWEEN ETHNICAL MAJORITY AND ETHNICAL MINORITY ON THE PRINCIPLE OF DIVISION "WE AND YOU" ETC. THE PAPER DEALS WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES BASED ON CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE (SIXTH) PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA. IT ALSO INDICATES TO THE PROBLEMS AND CONSEQUENCES ARISING FROM THE ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS OF REGULATION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF NATIONAL MINORITIES. FINALLY, THE STANDING IS REACHED THAT THESE AMENDMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE RETROGRADE IN REFERENCE TO ITS APPLICABLE SOLUTIONS AND EVEN THAT THEY WOULD HARM THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER AND REAL LIFE WITH UNACCEPTABLE CONSEQUENCES.
540	THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE CRIMINAL POLICY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTRADICTIONS IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COURTS. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE, WHICH CONTRADICTIONS OF CRIMINAL POLICY ARE GENERATED BY A MULTI-LEVEL SYSTEM OF COURTS, AND WHICH MECHANISMS FOR OVERCOMING THEM IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE CRIMINAL POLICY COULD BE FOUND OUT. THE METHODOLOGY. IN MODERN CONDITIONS OF DIVERSIFICATION OF METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO ORGANIZING AND CONDUCTING POLITICAL-LEGAL RESEARCH, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO DISCARD, BUT TO RETHINK AND REDISCOVER THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE METHODS OF CLASSICAL SCIENCE, ESPECIALLY THE METHOD OF DIALECTICAL ANALYSIS. THE MAIN RESULTS AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY. THE USE OF THE CATEGORY "DIALECTICAL CONTRADICTION" FOR THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING THE PROBLEMS OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE COURTS IN TERMS OF THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL LAW PROVISIONS OPENS UP NEW POSSIBILITIES IN THE STUDY OF CRIMINAL AND JUDICIAL POLICY, AS WELL AS DETERMINING THE PROSPECTS FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT. IN THE STUDY, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTRADICTIONS OF CRIMINAL POLICY REFER TO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN COURTS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND LEVELS THAT DEVELOP IN THE COURSE OF THEIR FUNCTIONING AND REFLECT THE OPPOSITE APPROACHES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES TO THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL LEGISLATION. CONSIDERING THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THESE CONTRADICTIONS CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING GROUPS: (A) BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COURTS; (B) BETWEEN SUPERIOR COURTS OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM; (C) BETWEEN THE COURTS OF VARIOUS INSTANCES OF THE SYSTEM OF COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION. THE CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COURTS, EMERGING IN THE FIELD OF PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, ARE AN OBJECTIVE SOURCE OF DEVELOPMENT OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE AND POLICY. THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS IS BASED ON THE CONSENSUS OF VARIOUS COURTS AND COMPROMISE. IF THE POSITION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, THE STATE ADJUSTS ITS LEGAL PRACTICE IN THE DIRECTION SET BY THE AUTHORITATIVE INTERNATIONAL INSTANCE BY MEANS OF: (A) DIRECT APPLICATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION WITH DUE REGARD FOR THE ECHR'S LEGAL POSITIONS; (B) THE APPLICATION OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION IN ITS CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, WHICH DOES NOT DIFFER FROM THE DECISIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE ECHR; (C) AMENDING NATIONAL LEGAL ACTS IN PURSUANCE OF ECHR JUDGMENTS. IN EXCEPTIONAL CASES, WHEN THE POSITION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT TOUCHES UPON ISSUES OF THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEGAL ORDER IS RESOLVED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON THE BASIS OF THE PRIORITY OF CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS. AT THE LEVEL OF THE SUPERIOR NATIONAL COURTS THE CONTRADICTIONS ARE REPRESENTED BY THE DIFFERING POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE SUPREME COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON THE ASSESSMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF CRIMINAL LAW PROVISIONS. SUCH CONTRADICTIONS CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS LATENT UNTIL THEY ARE NOT REVEALED IN CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEEDINGS. THE IDENTIFICATION AND RESOLUTION OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DIRECTION OF LEGAL POLICY IN THE COUNTRY; IT REFLECTS THE CONSISTENT SOLUTION OF THE AIM OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. AT THE LEVEL OF THE SYSTEM OF COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION, THE CONCEPT OF "CONTRADICTION" CAN ONLY BE APPLIED TO THOSE DIFFERING APPROACHES OF THE COURTS TO SOLVING CRIMINAL CASES THAT DO NOT GO BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW. CONTRADICTIONS ARISE ONLY WHEN, HAVING CORRECTLY ESTABLISHED THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE, THE COURTS DISAGREE IN THE CHOICE OF THE LEGAL PROVISION TO BE APPLIED, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH CHOICE CAN BE EXPLAINED AND MOTIVATED. THESE CONTRADICTIONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF CRIMINAL LEGISLATION. THEREFORE, THE MECHANISM FOR THEIR RESOLUTION INCLUDES NOT ONLY LAW REVISION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ITSELF TO DEVELOP A CONSENSUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE TEXTUAL CONTENT OF THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THE RULES FOR ITS APPLICATION. CONCLUSIONS. OVERCOMING THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL CRIMINAL POLICY IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE COURTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS ON THE BASIS OF DIFFERENTIATION OF JURISDICTION, RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY AND INDEPENDENCE.
541	THE ARTICLE IS A SUMMARY OF A CONFERENCE HELD AT JENA UNIVERSITY AT WHICH THE POLITICAL ISSUES OF OPTING OUT OF USING NUCLEAR POWER WERE SCRUTINIZED UNDER ASPECTS OF(CONSTITUTIONAL) LAW. THE RESULTS OF THE CONFERENCE WERE SUMMED UP IN THE JENA THESES ABOUT OPTING OUR OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER 1. MAKING AN APT-OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER IRREVERSIBLE IS IMPOSSIBLE MERELY FOR REASONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. 2. FEDERAL LEGISLATION ABOUT OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER REQUIRES THE CONSENT OF THE BUNDESRAT, THE CHAMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT REPRESENTING THE FEDERAL STATES. 3. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MANDATE TO IMPLEMENT AN OPT-OUR. HOWEVER, THIS IS LIMITED BY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. IN THAT RESPECT, CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS PROTECT MINORITIES. 4. FROM THE POINT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, THE AS ASSESSMENT OF OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER MUST BE BASED ON THE OWNERSHIP IN THEIR PLANTS OF PLANT OPERATORS. 5. OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER BY FOR CE OF LEGISLATION WOULD PRACTICALLY RENDER THIS OWNERSHIP "VOID," AS THE OWNERS WOULD BE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT THE "GREEN FIELD" ENCUMBERED, IN ADDITION, WITH THE COSTS OF DEMOLISHING THE POWER PLANTS. 6. THIS "VOIDING" OF OWNERSHIP CONSTITUTES EXPROPRIATION (ARTICLE 14, PARA.3, BASIC LAW), WHICH IS PERMITTED ONLY IF ADEQUATE COMPENSATION IS PAID. AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE, IT CANNOT BE CONTRACTED AWAY BY RESIDUAL LIFETIMES. 7. ONLY WHEN OWNERSHIP IN THE PLANTS HAS LOST IFS ECONOMIC VALUE, WITHDRAWAL OF THE OPERATING PERMIT IS TANTAMOUNT TO A WITHDRAWAL OF OWNERSHIP IN A PROPERTY. IN A TYPICAL ASSESSMENT, THIS IS THE EASE ONLY AFTER FORTY YEARS OF EFFECTIVE, INDIVIDUAL OPERATION. 8. THE THESIS THAT "VOIDING" THE OWNERSHIP OF PLANT OPERATORS WAS NOTHING BUT A REDEFINITION OF OWNERSHIP SO AS TO EXCLUDE FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM ANY OWNERSHIP IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, THUS ULTIMATELY CONSTITUTING CONSTRAINTS ON CONTENTS AND LIMITS WITHIN AN "OWNERSHIP REFORM NET," IS NOT CONVINCING. THE CASES REFERRED TO FROM THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RELATE TO CONSTELLATIONS IN WHICH SPECIFIC RIGHTS OF USE WERE EXEMPTED FROM BASIC OWNERSHIP (USE OF BODIES OF WATER, PURCHASING OPTION) IN WHICH, HOWEVER, THE ORIGINAL BASIC RIGHT CONTINUED TO EXIST. 9. EXPROPRIATION IS AN ULTIMA RATIO. IT IS PERMITTED ONLY FOR COMPELLING REASONS OF GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST. LEGISLATORS BEAR THE ONUS OF EXPLANATION AND WEIGHING OF SUCH REASONS. THEY THEREFORE MUST RELATE THE DUTY TO PROTECT HUMAN LIVES AND THE NATIONAL OBJECTIVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, AS PROTECTIVE DUTIES INTENSIFIED BY OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER, TO THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW INCURRED BY GERMANY, E.G, IN REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS. ON NO ACCOUNT IS THE SOLE REFERENCE TO THE INTENTION TO OPT OUT SUFFICIENT. WHETHER, INDEED, COMPELLING REASONS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC INTEREST EXIST, CAN BE EXAMINED BY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. 10. UNDER EUROPEAN LAW, OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER IS CONSIDERED LARGELY AN INTERNAL GERMAN AFFAIR. HOWEVER, THIS APPLIES ONLY AS LONG AS NO ENTERPRISE FROM OTHER MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION HOLDS A RESPONSIBLE SHARE IN THE OPERATION OF GERMAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. 11. OPTING OUT OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER BY CONSENSUS IS NOT A WAY OF BYPASSING THESE BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS, MOREOVER, IT PRESUPPOSES AN AMENDMENT TO THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT. CONTRACTS UNDER PUBLIC LAW AN THIS BASIS MAY BE CONCLUDED ONLY WITH THE INCLUSION OF ALL POWER PLANT OPERATORS, AND MUST PAY ATTENTION TO CRITERIA OF OWNERSHIP. ACCORDINGLY, ELECTRICITY UTILITIES ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO WAIVE THE COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATION. 12. UNDER THE COMPANY ACT, THIS WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING. 13. THE SO-CALLED EXECUTION OF THE CURRENT ATOMIC ENERGY ACT WITH THE INTENT TO OPT OUT IS A BIATANT VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE 20, PARAGRAPH 3 OF THE BASIC LAW. THIS SITUATION IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE PENDING AN AMENDMENT TO THE BASIC LAW.
542	DOLLARISATION AS ECONOMIC SOLUTION FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN DEMISE THE ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL MALAISE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR LONGER THAN A DECADE AND HAS DETERIORATED UNABATED RUNAWAY HYPERINFLATION REACHING UNTHINKABLE PROPORTIONS, AN ALMOST HUNDRED PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND A SHATTERED CURRENCY WITH LITERALLY NO EXTERNAL VALUE OR ESTEEM CHARACTERISE THIS DEMISE. FISCAL PROFLIGACY FUNDED BY AN EVER INCREASING FISCAL DEFICIT HAS PLAYED ITS PART IN THIS SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRAGEDY. THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF THE RESERVE BANK OF ZIMBABWE HAD FULFILLED ITS ROLE AS PROTECTOR OF THE NATION CURRENCY. SADLY THE BANK SLAVISHLY ACCOMMODATED THE GOVERNMENT REQUEST FOR PRINTING MORE MONEY AND DID NOT RENDER ANY SIGN OF INDEPENDENCE FROM GOVERNMENT AS A RESPECTED CENTRAL BANK SHOULD HAVE DONE. AS IN MANY OTHER CASES OF HYPERINFLATION, THIS WEAKNESS PROVIDED THE BASIS FROM WHICH THE EVOLVING TRAGEDY GAINED MOMENTUM. THE GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS OF THE CONTINUOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL TRAGEDY PREDICT AN EVEN BLEAKER FUTURE FOR THE COUNTRY IF NOT ATTENDED TO IN A DECISIVE WAY. NO INSTANT POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC SOLUTION EXISTS FOR THIS APPALLING SITUATION, BUT ECONOMIC RESTORATION HAS TO START WITH CERTAIN BASIC STEPS OF ECONOMIC REFORM. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS OFFICIAL DOLLARISATION AS AN ALTERNATIVE EXCHANGE RATE REGIME WITH WHICH TO CLEAR UP THE ECONOMIC DISORDER THAT CURRENTLY CHARACTERISES THE ECONOMIC SCENE. THE PAPER EXPLAINS THE TERM "DOLLARISATION", ITS FEATURES AND THE UNDERLYING RATIONALE OF THE REGIME AS A SUPER-FIXED EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM FOR ZIMBABWE. THEREAFTER THE POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES THAT ZIMBABWE CAN OBTAIN FROM THE SYSTEM ARE HIGHLIGHTED, ACCOMPANIED BY A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON RANDISATION AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AMONG THE ADVANTAGES IS THE FACT THAT DOLLARISATION WILL HELP TO RESTORE THE LOST CREDIBILITY OF THE ZIMBABWEAN POLICY-MAKERS SINCE IT WILL NOW BE IMPORTED EXTERNALLY FROM AN ANCHOR COUNTRY AND ITS CURRENCY. THIS WILL NOT ONLY SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE THE INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES, BUT IT WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PROMOTING SAVING, INVESTMENT, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT. IT WILL, FURTHERMORE, STABILISE THE DYSFUNCTIONAL ZIMBABWEAN CREDIT SYSTEM, ENHANCE LONG TERM LENDING CONTRACTS AND CORRECT THE MISALLOCATION OF RESOURCES CAUSED BY, HYPERINFLATION. THESE BENEFITS MUST BE BALANCED BY CERTAIN COSTS OF DOLLARISATION, ESPECIALLY THE LOSS OF SEIGNIORAGE INCOME, THE LOSS OF MONETARY AUTONOMY AND NATIONAL PRIDE, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF THE LENDER-OF-LAST-RESORT-FUNCTION OF THE CENTRAL BANK. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF ZIMBABWE THESE COSTS ARE FOUND TO BE THOROUGHLY OVERSHADOWED BY THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM DOLLARISATION. IN ADDITION, THE ZIMBABWEAN SITUATION AND THE CURRENT STANCE OF ITS ECONOMY ACTUALLY FIT THE PREREQUISITES FOR A COUNTRY THAT SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATE DOLLARISATION. ALTHOUGH DOLLARISATION IS SUPPORTED AS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR ZIMBABWE, RANDISATION MAY ALSO WORK BUT WILL HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED WITH CARE. SOUTH AFRICA IS INDEED THE BIGGEST TRADING PARTNER OF ZIMBABWE AND ALSO HAS DEEP FINANCIAL TIES WITH THE LATTER NEVERTHELESS, THE VOLATILITY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE RAND AND THE POSSIBILITY OF LOAN DEFAULT ON SOUTH AFRICAN LOANS TO ZIMBABWE ARE RISKS IN NEED OF CONTEMPLATION. ANOTHER BUT LESS CREDIBLE POLICY ALTERNATIVE FOR ZIMBABWE, IS TO ADOPT A CURRENCY BOARD ARRANGEMENT WHERE THE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE ZIMDOLLAR IS NOT ONLY FIRMLY FIXED TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN RAND, BUT ALSO FULLY (100 PER CENT) COVERED BY RAND RESERVES CIS A BACK-UP MEASURE OF CREDIBILITY. YET, UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES DOLLARISATION PRESENTS ITSELF AS A MORE LIKELY SYSTEM WITH WHICH TO OBTAIN RAPID AND TRUSTWORTHY RESULTS. ALTHOUGH DOLLARISATION ON ITS OWN WILL CERTAINLY HELP, IT WILL NOT POSE A "QUICK-FIX" FOR THE ZIMBABWEAN DEMISE. DOLLARISATION CAN NOT COMPENSATE FOR CORRUPTION, DISRUPTIONS IN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IT CAN NOT COMPENSATE FOR A LACK OF HUMAN PRUDENCE IN DECISION-MAKING, A LACK OF PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE ABSENCE OF A RULE OF LAW. THE LATTER ASPECTS REQUIRE FUNDAMENTAL AND CREDIBLE REFORMS ON THE POLITICAL AND JURIDICAL FRONT, WITHOUT WHICH NO ECONOMIC RESCUE PACKAGE WILL HAVE ANY SUCCESS WHATSOEVER
543	THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND RELIGION IN AUSTRALIA EXISTS IN A STATE OF TENSION. ON THE ONE HAND THE "NON-ESTABLISHMENT" CLAUSE IN SECTION 116 OF THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION POINTS TO THE SEPARATION OF RELIGION AND STATE. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF COOPERATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND RELIGION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, MOST VISIBLE IN THE FUNDING OF RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THESE TWO VISIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN STATE-RELIGION RELATIONSHIP ARE IN TENSION. ONE REQUIRING THE REMOVAL OF RELIGION FROM THE PUBLIC SPHERE WHILE THE OTHER CALLS FOR A PLURALITY OF RELIGIONS TO BE ACCOMMODATED IN PUBLIC SPACES. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO RESOLVE THIS TENSION BY PROPOSING A NEW WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE AUSTRALIAN STATE-RELIGION RELATIONSHIP AS NON-ESTABLISHMENT PLURALISM. NON-ESTABLISHMENT IN THE SENSE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY RELIGION-BE THAT A SINGLE STATE CHURCH, MULTIPLE STATE RELIGIONS, OR RELIGION GENERALLY. PLURALISM IN THAT THE STATE VIA ORDINARY LEGISLATION, PUBLIC POLICY, AND GOVERNMENT ACTION COOPERATES WITH RELIGION IN NUMEROUS AREAS OF STATE AND RELIGIOUS INTEREST IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE.
544	THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE MONITORING BODIES HAVE COMPETENCE CONCERNING RESERVATIONS IS AT THE CENTRE OF THE DISCUSSION OF RESERVATIONS TO HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES THAT HAS OCCUPIED MANY INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARS OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES. THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION'S TREATY MONITORING BODY, GREVIO, IS THE ONLY HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY MONITORING BODY WITH A DIRECT COMPETENCE CONCERNING RESERVATIONS. HOWEVER, AS PRACTICE TO DATE SHOWS, IT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH USE OF THIS POWER. THIS IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT CONSIDERING ALL THE EFFORTS OF OTHER BODIES IN THE PAST AND THE DOCTRINAL POSITIONS OF VARIOUS SCHOLARS. THE MAIN AIMS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE THREEFOLD TO: PRESENT GREVIO'S PRACTICE TO DATE CONCERNING RESERVATIONS, PROVIDE A BRIEF HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF HOW OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY BODIES HAVE APPROACHED THEIR ROLE CONCERNING RESERVATIONS, AND FINALLY, ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN WHY GREVIO HAS ABANDONED A MORE PROACTIVE POSITION ON RESERVATIONS.
545	WHENEVER A LEGISLATURE CREATES A TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC CRIME, IT FACES A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES. FIRST, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE NEW STATUTE WILL MERELY DUPLICATE EXISTING CRIMES, THUS OVER CRIMINALIZING THE CONDUCT AND CREATING UNNECESSARY CONFUSION. SECOND, THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT IT PROVIDES THE PROPER GUIDANCE TO PROSECUTORS, CITIZENS, AND COURTS REGARDING THE NEW CONCEPTS IN THE CRIMINAL STATUTE. AND FINALLY, THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT THE LAW CAN BE AMENDED AND UPDATED AS THE TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES. THE COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT ("CFAA") IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC CRIMINAL STATUTE THAT FAILS ALL OF THESE TESTS. MUCH OF THE CFAA IS COMPRISED OF FRAUD, EXTORTION, AND THEFT PROVISIONS WHICH PROHIBIT CONDUCT ALREADY COVERED BY EXISTING LAWS (OR COULD BE COVERED THROUGH MINOR CHANGES TO THOSE LAWS). THE ONLY TRULY UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THE CFAA ARE THE CONCEPTS OF "ACCESS" AND "TRESPASS," WHILE OTHER TERMS, SUCH AS "LOSS," "DAMAGE," AND "AUTHORIZATION," NEED TO BE GIVEN SPECIFIC MEANINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPUTER MISUSE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CFAA FAILS TO ADEQUATELY DEFINE ANY OF THESE TERMS. AND ALTHOUGH CONGRESS HAS AMENDED THE CFAA NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS, IT HAS STILL BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE FAST PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THIS AREA. THE BEST SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS FOR CONGRESS TO STOP TRYING TO REGULATE COMPUTER MISUSE DIRECTLY THROUGH LEGISLATION, AND INSTEAD EMPOWER AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY TO SET MORE DETAILED AND TECHNICAL RULES. AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY WOULD HAVE A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER LEGISLATURES AND COURTS BECAUSE IT COULD DEVELOP AND APPLY EXPERTISE IN SETTING RULES, GENERATE AND ENFORCE SEPARATE RULES FOR CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY, RESPOND QUICKLY IN CREATING OR CHANGING RULES IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING CONDITIONS, AND BE INSULATED FROM POLITICAL PRESSURES.
546	AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING IN CHINA, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE LED TO MAJOR PRACTICAL AND ACADEMIC CONCERNS. HOWEVER, FEW SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ON IN SITU URBANIZATION FROM A POLICY-TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK AIMS TO ANALYZE HOW DIGITAL POLICIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES CONTRIBUTE TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF IN SITU URBANIZATION PATTERNS. THIS STUDY FOLLOWS THE STRUCTURE OF LAW AND POLICY RESEARCH REGARDING THE PATH OF PHENOMENON PRESENTATION-INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS-LIMITATION INTERPRETATION. FIRST, THE LEGISLATION AND POLICIES FOR DIGITALIZATION OF THE COUNTRYSIDE HAS DRASTICALLY CHANGED THE LOGIC OF HOW TRADITIONAL IN SITU URBANIZATION WORKS. THE CONCEPT OF IN SITU URBANIZATION 2.0 IS USED TO DESCRIBE THIS NEW PHENOMENON. SECOND, HISTORICAL LEGITIMACY, PERFORMANCE LEGITIMACY, AND SOCIALLY SUSTAINABLE REPRODUCTION ARE THREE REASONS WHY RURAL DIGITALIZATION REFORM HAS TRIGGERED IN SITU URBANIZATION 2.0. FINALLY, THE DOUBLE DILEMMA OF OVERRELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE IN SITU URBANIZATION 2.0 PROCESS IS POINTED OUT; THESE DILEMMAS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH LEGISLATION AND POLICY ADJUSTMENTS. FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION ARE PROPOSED TO ADDRESS THESE DILEMMAS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE ON SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING AND RURAL DIGITALIZATION REFORM.
547	AS GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE JUSTIFY THE TRANSFORMATION OF MARIJUANA GOVERNANCE FROM ONE POLICE POWER (LAW ENFORCEMENT) TO OTHERS (E.G. PUBLIC HEALTH, ZONING), THE PLACE OF MARIJUANA IN LAWFUL SOCIETY IS TRANSFORMING RAPIDLY. NO VENUE IN CALIFORNIA IS MORE CENTRAL TO THIS THAN LAND-USE REGULATORY BODIES, WHICH DECIDE HOW MARIJUANA RIGHTS, PRACTICES, AND RELATIONS BECOME TERRITORIAL. LAND-USE POWERS, AS A DECLARATION OF THE STATE'S POLICE POWER, REQUIRE A DEFINITIONAL RENDERING OF COMMUNITY'. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES AN EPISODE OF OUTDOOR MARIJUANA CULTIVATION POLICY-MAKING AND THE STRUGGLES OVER THE DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY IN A CONSERVATIVE EXURBAN CALIFORNIA COUNTY. FROM DEBATES ON FENCES, PROPERTY LINE SETBACKS, RENTAL TERMS, AND NUISANCE COMPLAINTS TO RACIAL AND ECONOMIC ANXIETIES AND THE ROAMING STIGMA OF CRIME, MARIJUANA ADVOCATES CONFRONTED A POWERFUL LOGIC OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AND THE MORAL-AESTHETIC PROPRIETY IT IMPLIES. DESPITE THE SUBORDINATION OF ADVOCATES' CLAIMS TO THE TERMS OF PRIVATE PROPERTY, OUTLAW COMMUNITIES SUSTAINED THEIR OWN FORMS OF TERRITORIAL GOVERNANCE, INFORMAL REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT POWERS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS OF COMMUNITY. THIS EPISODE, WHICH ILLUMINATES TERRITORIAL PRODUCTION ACROSS ILLEGAL/LEGAL LINES, HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDINGS OF LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, POLITICAL POSSIBILITY, AND THE PRACTICE OF CITIZENSHIP. EXTRACTOMIENTRAS QUE LOS GOBIERNOS DE TODO EL MUNDO JUSTIFICAN LA TRANSFORMACION DE LA GESTION DE LA MARIHUANA DE UN PODER POLICIAL (APLICACION DE LA LEY) A OTROS (P. EJ., SALUD PUBLICA, ZONIFICACION), EL LUGAR DE LA MARIHUANA EN UNA SOCIEDAD LEGITIMA SE ESTA TRANSFORMANDO CON RAPIDEZ. AL RESPECTO, NINGUNA ENTIDAD TIENE MAS RELEVANCIA EN CALIFORNIA QUE LOS ORGANISMOS DE CONTROL DEL USO DEL SUELO QUE SON LOS QUE DECIDEN COMO SE CONVIERTEN EN TERRITORIALES LOS DERECHOS, LAS PRACTICAS Y LAS RELACIONES DE LA MARIHUANA. LOS PODERES DEL USO DEL SUELO, COMO UNA DECLARACION DEL PODER POLICIAL DEL ESTADO, REQUIEREN UNA INTERPRETACION QUE DEFINA EL CONCEPTO DE COMUNIDAD'. EN ESTE ARTICULO SE ANALIZA EL CASO DE LA FORMULACION DE POLITICAS PARA EL CULTIVO DE MARIHUANA EN EL EXTERIOR Y LOS ESFUERZOS POR DEFINIR UNA COMUNIDAD EN UN MUNICIPIO CONSERVADOR Y EXURBANO DE CALIFORNIA. DESDE DISCUSIONES SOBRE VALLADOS, DIFICULTADES CON LOS LIMITES DE PROPIEDAD, CONDICIONES DE LOS ALQUILERES Y QUEJAS POR RUIDOS HASTA INQUIETUDES RACIALES Y ECONOMICAS Y EL ITINERANTE ESTIGMA DEL CRIMEN, LOS PARTIDARIOS DE LA MARIHUANA SE VEIAN CONFRONTADOS A UNA LOGICA DE PODER DE LA PROPIEDAD PRIVADA Y EL DECORO MORAL-ESTETICO QUE IMPLICA.

548	PURPOSE THE QUESTION OF PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT FOR BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES HAS CREATED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POLITICAL AS WELL AS ACADEMIC INTEREST. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE HOW GOVERNANCE AFFECTS PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION IN THE ARABIAN GULF COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1996 AND 2015 PERIOD. THE SIX WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) (VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (VAA), POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE/TERRORISM, GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVENESS (GEFF), REGULATORY QUALITY (RQ), RULE OF LAW (RL) AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION) WERE USED TO MEASURE THE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AN INCREASE IN EVERY GOVERNANCE INDICATOR EXCEPT CONTROL OF CORRUPTION LEADS TO A DECREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS ESTIMATE A DYNAMIC SPECIFICATION OF DEBT TO GDP RATIO TO STUDY HOW GOVERNANCE AFFECTS PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION IN THE ARABIAN GULF COUNTRIES DURING THE 1996-2015 PERIOD. THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN THIS STUDY IS THE RATIO OF PUBLIC DEBT TO GDP. THIS STUDY RELIES ON THE SIX MEASURES OF INSTITUTION'S QUALITY GIVEN BY THE WGI. THESE VARIABLES ARE THE VAA, POLITICAL STABILITY AND ABSENCE OF VIOLENCE (PSAV)/TERRORISM, GEFF, RQ, RL AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. ADDITIONAL CONTROL VARIABLES ARE ALSO INCORPORATED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE OMITTED VARIABLES BIAS. THESE INCLUDE THE RATE OF INFLATION (AL-MARHUBI, 2000) AND THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE LAGGED ONE PERIOD. THE STUDY OF THE STATISTICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND PUBLIC DEBT ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY THE DIRECT EFFECT OF GOVERNANCE ON PUBLIC DEBT, WHICH IS THE EFFECT THAT GOES THROUGH AN INCREASE IN SPENDING OR A REDUCTION IN FISCAL REVENUES AND NOT THROUGH A DECREASE IN GDP GROWTH. THE ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATION IS CARRIED OUT USING PANEL FIXED EFFECTS AND GLS RANDOM EFFECTS. FINDINGS THE ESTIMATION RESULTS CONFIRM THE CORE HYPOTHESIS, WHICH CONSIDERS THAT THE POOR GOVERNANCE IN A COUNTRY THE HIGHER IS THE RATIO OF PUBLIC DEBT TO GDP, CETERIS PARIBUS. INDEED, FIVE OF THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDEX ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH PUBLIC DEBT RATIO. THESE INDICES ARE GEFF, VAA, PSAV, RQ AND RL. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS FOR OTHER INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES IN THE LITERATURE. THE COEFFICIENT ON THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE PER CAPITA INCOME HAS THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED NEGATIVE SIGN AND IT IS HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, IMPLYING THAT THE HIGHER THE PER CAPITA INCOME IN A COUNTRY, THE LOWER THE RATIO OF PUBLIC DEBT. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE HAS THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED POSITIVE SIGN SUGGESTING THAT THE HIGHER THE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, THE HIGHER THE RATIO OF PUBLIC DEBT. THE EDUCATION VARIABLE HAS NEGATIVE BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COEFFICIENTS. THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND LAG DEBT RATIO) HAVE THE EXPECTED SIGNS AND ARE HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, IMPLYING THAT THE HIGHER THEIR VALUE IN A COUNTRY, THE HIGHER THE RATIO OF PUBLIC DEBT TO GDP. HAVING THE THEORETICALLY EXPECTED EFFECT, THE GDP GROWTH VARIABLE IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH PUBLIC DEBT RATIO BUT ITS COEFFICIENTS ARE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE ALTHOUGH THE LITERATURE ON THE DAMAGING EFFECTS OF POOR GOVERNANCE ON GROWTH IS ABUNDANT (TANZI AND DAVOODI, 2002; MAURO, 1996; MO, 2001; MAURO, 1996; BRUNETTI ET AL., 1997; CAMPOS ET AL., 1999; AL-MARHUBI, 2000; DEPKEN AND LAFOUNTAIN, 2006; MAURO, 1998), ONLY VERY RECENTLY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. BY REVIEWING THE RESEARCH ON POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DETERMINANTS OF PUBLIC DEBT, IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES, WHICH HAVE EXAMINED REGIONAL DIFFERENCES, AND EVEN FEWER ONES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE COUNTRIES OF THE GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (GCC). THEREFORE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO FILL THE GAP BY FOCUSING ON THIS ECONOMIC REGION. FURTHERMORE, WHEN STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND THE ACCUMULATION OF PUBLIC DEBT, EXISTING STUDIES FOCUS ONLY ON CORRUPTION INDEX AND NEGLECT OTHER DETERMINANTS OF GOVERNANCE. THUS, A SECOND CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW INSTITUTION QUALITY, THROUGH THE SIX WGI, AFFECTS PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION. FURTHERMORE, GIVEN THE RECENT RISE IN PUBLIC DEBT IN GCC COUNTRIES, AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IS WHAT POLICY ACTIONS DO THESE COUNTRIES NEED TO TAKE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DEBT WILL BE SUSTAINABLE AND WILL NOT OVERWHELM THEIR FINANCIAL SYSTEM? WE CAN ADD: WHILE THERE HAS BEEN MUCH ATTENTION GIVEN TO THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EXPLANATIONS OF PUBLIC DEBT ACCUMULATION IN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ON A GLOBAL SCALE, SCHOLARS SO FAR HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS DEBATE IN HIGH INCOME OIL PRODUCERS.
549	SINCE THE TREATY OF WESTPHALIA, SOVEREIGN STATES HAVE COMBINED NATIONAL SECURITY WITH BORDER SECURITY, AS BORDER IS ACCEPTED AS THE LINE OF SOVEREIGNTY THAT SEPARATES "US" FROM "OTHERS". THE STEP OF FORMING A EUROPEAN IDENTITY AS A SUPRA-IDENTITY APART FROM THE NATIONAL IDENTITIES OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITHIN THE BORDERS OF EACH STATE TAKES ITS ROOTS FROM THIS PERCEPTION OF BEING "US". THOUGH HIGHLIGHTED IN COPENHAGEN CRITERIA THAT THE STABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS GUARANTEEING DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR AND PROTECTION OF MINORITIES ARE ENSURED; WHEN WE LOOK AT TODAY'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES WE SEE A SERIOUS DEVIATION FROM THIS FOUNDING APPROACH EMPHASIZING AND ENSURING MULTICULTURALISM. WITH LABOUR MIGRATION IN THE 1960S, REFUGEES FLEEING YUGOSLAVIA IN THE 1990S, AND THE 2015 REFUGEE CRISIS, EUROPE'S POPULATION STRUCTURE BEGAN TO CHANGE. FOLLOWING THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE SECURITY APPROACH HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS IN MIGRATION MANAGEMENT. THE 2015 REFUGEE CRISIS HAS BECOME NOT ONLY A BORDER SECURITY CRISIS BUT ALSO A CRISIS OF EUROPEAN IDENTITY AND WELFARE STATE PROTECTION. THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF RELIGION, NATIONALISM, AND ECONOMIC CONCERNS ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF IMMIGRATION POLICIES AFTER 2015 IN DENMARK, WHICH EMPLOYS EXTREME RESTRICTIVE POLICIES, AND SWEDEN, WHICH HAS A RELATIVELY WELCOMING CULTURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE LITERATURE DISCUSSES WHETHER THOSE COUNTRIES ARE RELIGIOUS OR SECULAR; IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF RELIGION AND NATIONALISM ON MIGRATION POLICIES, AS WELL AS A DISCUSSION OF ITS FUTURE IMPLICATIONS. DENMARK HAD BEEN EXTREMELY HOMOGENEOUS WITH ONLY ONE LANGUAGE AND RELIGION AND NO ETHNIC MINORITIES, THOUGH, THIS HOMOGENEOUS STRUCTURE HAS BEGUN TO DETERIORATE WITH THE INCREASE IN NON-WESTERN IMMIGRATION SINCE THE 1990S. WHILE THE DANISH LAW OF 1983 WAS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE MOST LIBERAL IN EUROPE, AFTER 1990, EQUAL RIGHTS WERE REPLACED BY IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY AND INTEGRATION. WITH THE RISE OF THE ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTIES IN THE 2001 ELECTIONS, SOCIAL RIGHTS WERE CURTAILED, AND DANISH VALUES TOOK CENTRE STAGE. IN DENMARK, RULES LIKE REDUCING SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AFTER 2015 AIM TO PROTECT THE WELFARE STATE, WHEREAS RULES LIKE THE BAN ON THE BURQA AND THE HANDSHAKE IN THE NATURALIZATION CEREMONY ARE MOTIVATED BY OTHER FACTORS. THE DANISH PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCED THE ZERO-REFUGEE TARGET, THE ANTI-IMMIGRANT FARRIGHT DANISH PEOPLE'S PARTY DECLARED THEIR INTENTION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF ALL IMMIGRANTS. SO, A NEW DISCOURSE HAS EMERGED IN WHICH NO FORM OF IMMIGRATION IS DESIRED. ON THE OTHER HAND, SWEDEN FOLLOWS DENMARK SLIGHTLY BEHIND IN TERMS OF PROCESS, BUT BY GOING THROUGH LITERALLY THE SAME PROCESSES. WHILE POSITIVE DISCOURSE ABOUT IMMIGRANTS HAD BEEN DOMINANT IN SWEDEN, WHICH IMPLEMENTED MULTICULTURAL POLICIES, THE DISCOURSE TURNED NEGATIVE WITH THE 2015 REFUGEE CRISIS. INCREASING UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG IMMIGRANTS, INCOME INEQUALITY, AND SWEDISH IDENTITY DISCUSSIONS SEEMS TO LEAD TO A RISE IN NATIONALISM AND NATIVISM IN THE 2022 ELECTIONS, AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN THE GENEROSITY OF THE WELFARE STATE. DENMARK AND SWEDEN CASES SHOW HOW SIMILAR WELFARE STATES WITH THE SAME HISTORICAL AND IMMIGRATION BACKGROUND RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO THE REFUGEE CRISIS. WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS IS HIGH IN BOTH COUNTRIES, IT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES HIGHER IN SWEDEN. REFUGEE CRISIS HAS MADE RELIGIOUS IDENTITY MORE VISIBLE AND PUT PRESSURE ON SCANDINAVIAN WELFARE MODEL AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTS. ALTHOUGH INTEGRATION AND ASSIMILATION POLICIES ARE BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT IN TERMS OF RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS OF MUSLIMS, THE EMPHASIS ON RELIGION IS NOT MADE DIRECTLY, INSTEAD, IT IS MADE THROUGH THE SYMBOLS OF ISLAM. THE REASON WHY MUSLIMS CONSIDERED AS "OTHERS" MAINLY TAKES ITS FOUNDATION FROM THIS DIFFERENCE. ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT MAKE RELIGION AN IMPORTANT PART OF THEIR LIFE, AND ATHEISM IS HIGHER THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES CHRISTIANITY IS STILL CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EUROPEAN IDENTITY AND THE CHURCH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT. ACCORDING TO THE CONCLUSION OF THIS STUDY, IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT DENMARK MIGHT SERVE AS A MODEL TO EUROPE, PRIMARILY TO NORDIC COUNTRIES, AND THIS STRENGTHENS THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTI-IMMIGRANT OPPOSITION WILL SHARPEN AND DIVIDE SOCIETIES. THE EFFECTS OF RADICAL ISLAM, WHICH IS GRADUALLY INCREASING ITS INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD, IS UNDOUBTEDLY HUGE IN THESE POLITICS THROUGHOUT EUROPE; HOWEVER, ABANDONING OR DEVIATING FROM POLICIES TARGETING MULTICULTURALISM MIGHT CAUSE ISOLATION AND ALIENATION OF IMMIGRANTS, WHO ARE ALREADY FLEEING FROM TERRORISM, AND PUSH THEM TOWARDS RADICALIZATION WHICH CONSTITUTES ANOTHER DANGER.
550	MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES, WEB-BASED PLATFORMS, AND SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE TRANSFORMED THE LANDSCAPE OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT BY ENABLING A NEW GENERATION OF DIGITAL NETWORKS TO PRODUCE, PROCESS, AND ANALYSE GEOREFERENCED DATA IN REAL TIME. THIS UNPRECEDENTED CONVERGENCE OF GEOMOBILE TECHNOLOGIES AND CROWDSOURCING METHODS IS OPENING UP MULTIPLE FORMS TO PARTICIPATE IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT TASKS. BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, THIS PAPER FIRST PROPOSES A CONCEPTUALISATION OF CROWDSOURCING ROLES AND THEN ANALYSES METHODS AND TOOLS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF TWO VARIABLES: (I) TYPES OF DATA BEING PROCESSED; (II) INVOLVEMENT OF THE CROWDS. THE PAPER ALSO SURVEYS A NUMBER OF EXISTING PLATFORMS AND MOBILE APPS LEVERAGING CROWDSOURCING IN DISASTER AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WITH THE AIM TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITS OF USING CROWDSOURCING METHODS AND TOOLS IN THESE AREAS.
551	DOES INTERNATIONAL LAW MATTER ON THE PERIPHERY, WHERE POTENTIAL SUBJECTS ARE MARGINALIZED WITH UNCERTAIN LEGAL STATUS AND WITHOUT LAWMAKING POWER? UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS WOULD INTERNATIONAL LAW MATTER AMONG THE ACTORS ON THE PERIPHERY, TO BE ACCEPTED AS LAW, REMAIN RELEVANT, AND EVENTUALLY BE COMPLIED WITH? BY ADOPTING AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE FROM INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES HOW INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL) IS ACCEPTED AND ADHERED TO AMONG THE NON-STATE ARMED ACTORS (NSAAS). THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW MATTERS ON THE PERIPHERY WHEN TWO CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE FIRST IS WHEN INCENTIVES OF NSAAS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH IHL'S GOAL OF RESTRAINT. THE SECOND IS WHEN THE INTERPRETATION OF IHL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AMPLE EXAMPLES OF NSAAS' WORDS AND DEEDS TO ILLUSTRATE THE ARGUMENTS.
552	THE IMPLICATIONS OF CLIENTELISM FOR DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY ARE MIXED: BROKERS NOT ONLY HELP COORDINATE VOTES FOR COLLECTIVE GAIN BUT ALSO EXPLOIT THEIR POSITION TO ADVANCE PERSONAL INTEREST. I ARGUE THAT BROKERS USE DISTINCT STRATEGIESPERSUASION, RECIPROCATION, AND PUNISHMENTTO MOTIVATE VOTERS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. COMPETITIVELY SELECTED BROKERS WHOSE PREFERENCES ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF FOLLOWERS CAN RELY MORE ON PERSUASION THAN INSTRUMENTAL INDUCEMENTS. ECONOMICALLY AUTONOMOUS BROKERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RELY ON SANCTIONS THAN RECIPROCITY. EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT BOTH THE PROPOSED TYPOLOGY OF BROKER STRATEGIES AND THEIR DETERMINANTS IS COLLECTED IN SENEGAL, A CLIENTELISTIC DEMOCRACY WHERE GROUP-LEVEL HETEROGENEITY GENERATES NATURAL VARIATION IN BROKER TYPES. A COORDINATION GAME PLAYED WITH REAL BROKERS ILLUSTRATES THAT PARTICIPANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL GAIN WHEN BROKERS ARE COMPETITIVELY SELECTED, MORE LIKELY WHEN THEY MOST FEAR RETRIBUTION. QUALITATIVE DATA SUGGEST THAT RESULTS FROM THE LABORATORY GAME PLAUSIBLY GENERALIZE TO BEHAVIOR IN ELECTIONS.
553	AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE WIDER EUROPEAN CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW THE ECTHR AND NORWEGIAN COURTS COOPERATE FOR THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ECHR IN NORWAY. IT BEGINS WITH SETTING OUT A WIDELY HELD UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONVENTION SYSTEM AS A COOPERATIVE SYSTEM WITH DOMESTIC COURTS AS PRIMARY ACTORS, AND THE ECTHR AS A SUBSIDIARY ACTOR FOR ENFORCING THE ECHR. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHETHER THE ECTHR - THROUGH ITS USE OF AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT RELATES TO NORWEGIAN COURT DECISIONS IN ITS OWN JUDGMENTS - ENCOURAGES AND REINFORCES THE ROLE OF THESE COURTS AS THE PRIMARY ACTORS IN THIS SYSTEM. IT FIRST ANALYSES HOW THE ECTHR ENDORSES AND PROMOTES THE DIRECT ENGAGEMENT OF NORWEGIAN COURTS WITH THE ECHR AND ECTHR JURISPRUDENCE, AS WELL AS HOW IT ENDORSES AND PROMOTES GOOD PROCEDURES AND HIGH-QUALITY REASONING OF THESE COURTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO PRODUCE OUTCOMES IN CONFORMITY WITH THE ECHR. SECONDLY, IT EXAMINES WHETHER THE ECTHR ALSO ENCOURAGES THE NORWEGIAN COURTS TO ACTIVELY DEVELOP THE RIGHTS OF THE CONVENTION ("EVOLUTIVE" INTERPRETATION). THE ARTICLE FURTHERMORE DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF DOMESTIC COURTS BECOMING MORE ACTIVE IN APPLYING THE CONVENTION, BOTH FOR THE NORWEGIAN CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE CONVENTION SYSTEM, AND HOW THE ECTHR AND NORWEGIAN COURTS ADDRESS OR SHOULD ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND IMPROVE THEIR COOPERATION. THIS IS DONE INTER ALIA THROUGH A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, HIGHLIGHTING WHAT NORWAY CAN LEARN FROM OTHER MEMBER STATES OF THE COE; AND WHAT OTHER MEMBER STATES CAN LEARN FROM NORWAY.
554	DISCLOSURE OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION INVOLVES THE INTERESTS OF THE APPLICANT, THIRD PARTIES AND THE PUBLIC. BOTH SYSTEMS FOR ASSESSMENT OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THE LESSENING IMPORTANCE OF THE APPLICANT'S QUALIFICATIONS MAKE PUBLIC INTEREST THE PRINCIPAL DRIVER FOR DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. EXEMPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE CONTAIN AN IMPLICIT PUBLIC INTEREST. IN CONFLICTS BETWEEN OPPOSING INTERESTS OVER DISCLOSURE AND NON-DISCLOSURE, PUBLIC INTEREST IS THE KEY TO BALANCING INTERESTS. PUBLIC INTERESTS SUPPORTING DISCLOSURE ARE RELATED TO SUCH VALUES AS THE RIGHT TO KNOW, DEMOCRACY AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, WHEREAS THE INTERESTS SUPPORTING NON-DISCLOSURE TEND TO BE IMPLICIT IN THE EXEMPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE. MULTIPLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND THE TWO-SIDEDNESS OF PUBLIC INTEREST INCREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF WEIGHING THE INTERESTS INVOLVED. FULL AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF INTERESTS AND THE EXCLUSION OF UNRELATED CONSIDERATIONS ARE THE PREMISE FOR ASSESSMENT OF INTERESTS. PRIORITIZING THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND PRIORITIZING OPENNESS ARE INSTITUTIONAL VALUES OF THE LAWS ON DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE FOR ASSESSING INTERESTS.
555	IN LIGHT OF THE UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH TURNOUT IN THE 2019 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTION, WE EXPLORE HOW MAJOR TRANSNATIONAL POLICY ISSUES MOBILIZE VOTERS IN EUROPEAN ELECTORAL CONTESTS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF TWO DATA SETS, THE EUROBAROMETER POST-ELECTION SURVEY AND THE RECONNECT PANEL SURVEY, WE MAKE THREE IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS. FIRST, EUROPEAN CITIZENS SHOW A HIGHER TENDENCY TO PARTICIPATE IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS WHEN THEY ATTRIBUTE GREATER IMPORTANCE TO THE ISSUES 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENT', 'ECONOMY AND GROWTH', AND 'IMMIGRATION'. SECOND, HAVING A MORE EXTREME OPINION ON THE ISSUE OF 'EUROPEAN INTEGRATION' INCREASES PEOPLE'S LIKELIHOOD TO VOTE IN EUROPEAN ELECTIONS. THIRD, THE MOBILIZING EFFECT OF PERSONAL ISSUE IMPORTANCE IS ENHANCED BY THE SYSTEMIC SALIENCE THAT THE RESPECTIVE POLICY ISSUE HAS DURING THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THE RELEVANCE OF ISSUE MOBILIZATION IN EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS AS WELL AS ITS CONTEXT-DEPENDENT NATURE.
556	IN THIS ARTICLE, FIRST OF ALL, THE BASIC IDEAS PUT FORWARD IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NATURAL LAW MOVEMENT ARE GIVEN: THAT THERE IS A LEGAL ORDER THAT IS DESIRED TO BE ACHIEVED ALONGSIDE OR ABOVE THE LAW CREATED BY THE STATE, THAT IT IS ACCEPTED AS GENERALLY VALID FOR ALL PEOPLE AND NATIONS BECAUSE IT IS A MORE PERFECT AND HIGHER LAW AS OPPOSED TO ALL POSITIVE LEGAL SYSTEMS, THAT IT CONSISTS OF THE SUM OF SOME HIGH RULES THAT FIND ITS VALIDITY IN ITS OWN ESSENCE, THAT IT IS AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE AND CONTROL MECHANISM FOR POSITIVE LAW, AND THAT THE UNDERSTANDING OF NATURAL LAW IS THE PIONEER OF ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF LAW. THEN, STARTING WITH HERACLITUS, SOCRATES, WHO WAS ONE OF THE PIONEERS OF NATURAL LAW WITH HIS DEFENSE OF THE CONCEPTS OF MORALITY, VIRTUE AND JUSTICE; SOPHOCLES, WHO STATED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMANDS WERE NEVER POWERFUL ENOUGH TO OVERRIDE DIVINE COMMANDS; PLATO, WHO DEFENDED NATURAL LAW BY REFLECTING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE WORLD OF IDEAS AND THE WORLD OF SENSES, WHICH IS THE BASIS OF HIS PHILOSOPHY, TO THE FIELD OF LAW; ARISTOTLE, WHO SAW NATURAL LAW AS A GUIDE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF POSITIVE LAW, CICERO, WHO STATED THAT NATURAL LAW COVERS ALL HUMAN BEINGS, THAT LAW ARISES NOT FROM HUMAN WILL BUT FROM THE NATURE OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THINGS, GROTIUS, WHO STATED THAT THE FIRST BASIC PRINCIPLE OF NATURAL LAW IS LOYALTY TO THE COVENANT, PUFENDORF, WHO GAVE MORE PLACE TO GOD IN NATURAL LAW THOUGHT, AND NATURAL LAW THINKERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, THE HISTORICAL COURSE OF NATURAL LAW HAS BEEN CONVEYED. AFTER THAT, THE BASIC IDEAS DEFENDED IN THE NATURAL LAW APPROACH ARE ANALYZED UNDER FIVE HEADINGS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ISLAMIC LAW. IN THE FIRST HEADING, IN THE AXIS OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE SOURCE OF LAW AS HUMAN NATURE, THE NATURE OF THINGS, THE DIVINE WILL, AND THE HUMAN INTELLECT, IT WAS ARGUED THAT FOCUSING ON THE ACTIVITY OF IJTIHAD ON THE HUMAN SOUL AND CHARACTERIZING IT AS A SEARCH FOR THE IDEAL OF JUSTICE IN THE HUMAN SOUL MEANS TAKING AN OPPOSITIONAL STANCE REGARDING THE ESSENCE OF THE METHOD OF FIQH , IT WAS DEALT WITH BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE INTELLECT IS NOT THE ABSOLUTE PROOF OF LAW, THAT THE ACTIVITY OF THE INTELLECT IS NOT IN THE FORM OF MAKING JUDGMENTS INDEPENDENTLY BUT IN THE FORM OF DISCOVERING AND REVEALING WHAT EXISTS IN THE NASS , AND THAT THE SOURCE OF LAW IS EXPLAINED BY THE DIVINE WILL, NOT THE DIVINE INTELLECT. IN THE SECOND HEADING, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAW AS IT IS AND THE LAW AS IT SHOULD BE IS DISCUSSED BY STATING THAT IF THERE IS THE IJMA OF THE UMMAH ON A RULING, THAT RULING IS IDEAL, THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SEARCH FOR A MORE IDEAL ONE, AND THAT NO IJTIHADI RULING IS ACCEPTED AS THE ABSOLUTE, UNDISPUTED RULING OF ISLAM. IN THE THIRD HEADING, IT IS STATED THAT THE ISSUE OF AL-HUSN AND AL-QUBH IS ONE OF THE ANCIENT AREAS OF DISPUTE AMONG THE ULEMA , THAT THE INTELLECT'S KNOWING WHAT IS HASEN AND PRODUCING BINDING KNOWLEDGE IN THIS REGARD WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO CHARACTERIZE THE INTELLECT AS AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE OF LAW, THAT IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SPEAK OF A RULE OF LAW THAT FINDS ITS VALIDITY IN ITS OWN SUBSTANCE AS ADVOCATED IN NATURAL LAW IN TERMS OF THE ASH'ARI APPROACH IN ISLAMIC LAW, AND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SPEAK OF RULES OF LAW THAT FIND THEIR VALIDITY IN THEIR OWN SUBSTANCE, IN TERMS OF THE MATURIDI APPROACH, THE APPROACH OF MUTAZILA, WHICH STATES THAT GOOD AND EVIL EXIST ESSENTIALLY IN ACTS AND THINGS, THAT THE INTELLECT CAN KNOW GOOD AND EVIL AND THAT THIS IS BINDING KNOWLEDGE, AND THE APPROACH DEFENDED IN NATURAL LAW OVERLAP, AND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO LIMIT THE DIVINE WILL WITH ANY PRINCIPLE OR RULE IN TERMS OF SUNNI THEOLOGY AND ISLAMIC LAW, AND THE HIGH LEGAL RULES THAT FIND THEIR VALIDITY IN THEIR OWN SUBSTANCE ARE EVALUATED. IN THE FOURTH HEADING, IT IS STATED THAT SOME FACTORS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN THE PROCESS OF BOTH THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RULES CREATE INEVITABLE AREAS OF DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN JUSTICE AND LAW, AND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SEE ONE JURISPRUDENCE AS SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER ON A THEORETICAL LEVEL, NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO SEE THE LEVEL OF JUSTICE ACHIEVED BY ANY OF THESE JURISPRUDENCES AS MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT ACHIEVED BY THE OTHER. THE FIFTH CHAPTER ANALYZES THE VIEW OF NATURAL LAW AS THE CRITERION OF LEGAL VALUE AND THE PIONEER OF PROGRESS BY STATING THAT THE IJTIHAD UNDERSTANDING AND FREEDOM OF JURISPRUDENCE IS THE PIONEER OF PROGRESS IN TERMS OF ISLAMIC LAW. THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED.
557	THE ARTICLE IS THE OUTLINE OF AN ARGUMENT OF A PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONIST PLEADING FOR CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE LETTER OF LAW IN ORDER TO FURTHER A BETTER SOCIETY IN SOUTH AFRICA IN 2015. THE VIRTUE OF ADHERENCE TO THE LETTER OF LAW IS EXPOUNDED THE ARTICLE DOES NOT ADVOCATE ATTENTION TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW, AS OPPOSED TO THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW, AS A UNIVERSAL IDEAL, BUT ARGUES FOR THIS IN A SPECIFIC CONTEXT. IT GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN OF CURRENT THINKING IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHICH PROMOTES FLEXIBLE, INNOVATIVE AND ENTERPRISING BEHAVIOUR IN PUBLIC OFFICIALS. THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THE ARTICLE CONSISTS OF A SOCIETAL ANALYSIS, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF COMPETENCES THAT MAY BE LACKING IN OUR TIME; A DISCUSSION OF DISCOURSES DEALING WITH THE QUESTION OF ABIDING BY THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW AND HOW THIS PERTAINS TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION; AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONDITIONS OF LITERALNESS AND OF ITS DANGERS; A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WRITING AND READING; AND FINALLY A SUGGESTION ON HOW UNSUITABLE PRESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED BY THE STATE. THE CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION MADE BY THE 19TH-CENTURY SOCIOLOGIST FERDINAND TOWNIES BETWEEN COMMUNITY (GEMEINSCHAFT) AND CIVIL SOCIETY (GESELLSCHAFT) IS USED TO EMPHASISE THE NEED FOR FORMAL REGULATION IN A SOCIAL SITUATION SUCH AS THE SOUTH AFRICA OF OUR TIMES. BECAUSE SOUTH AFRICA AS A STATE IS A GESELLSCHAFT, ONE SHOULD FACE THIS FACT AND NOT TREAT IT AS IF IT WERE A GEMEINSCHAFT. WHEN LAWLESSNESS REIGNS THE GESELLSCHAFT MAY COLLAPSE. LAWS AND OTHER RULES MAKE LIVING TOGETHER AS A SOCIETY POSSIBLE. THAT MEANS WE OUGHT TO SEE OURSELVES AS MEMBERS OF THE GROUP TO WHICH THE LEGISLATION CONCERNED APPLIES. THE ARTICLE ALSO BRIEFLY TOUCHES ON THE FUNCTIONS AND ADVANTAGES OF ADMINISTRATIVE RULE-MAKING. WRITING IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THIS REGARD. WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT IT. WRITTEN LAW AFFORDS THE TYRANT LESS PROTECTION THAN ORAL LAW. WRITTEN LAW PROMOTES DEMOCRATIC TRANSPARENCY, PROVIDED IT IS DRAFTED IN LANGUAGE ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND. IN THE LONG RUN THE CONTENT OF WHAT WAS AGREED UPON IN, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996, WILL BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ACTIVITIES OF ELITES THAT RESULTED IN THE ADOPTION OF THE TEXT. THE LETTER OF THE LAW IS DEFINED AS THAT WHICH IS IN WRITING AS OPPOSED TO THAT WHICH IS NOT WRITTEN. THE OPPOSITION OF THE LETTER OF THE LAW AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW IS NOT SIMPLE, SINCE THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW CAN ALSO BE WRITTEN DOWN. IT IS CONCEDED THAT THE LETTER OF THE LAW MAY HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED, BUT IDEALLY BY USING OTHER LETTERS IN THE FORM OF WRITTEN GUIDELINES. THE NEED FOR INTERPRETATION IS ILLUSTRATED BY MEANS OF SECTION 217 OF THE CONSTITUTION, 1996, WHICH DEALS WITH PUBLIC PROCUREMENT. THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS SECTION HAS NOT BEEN DEALT WITH DEFINITIVELY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS GENERAL PRINCIPLES, BUT THE INTERPRETATION IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE LETTERS IN THAT SECTION. THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT ONESELF TO THE WRITTEN LETTER OF THE LAW (AND OTHER WRITTEN PRESCRIPTS SUCH AS THE RULES OF A GAME, ROAD SIGNS, MUSICAL SCORES AND CONTRACTS) IS AN ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR CIVILISATION AND IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE THREE GREAT RELIGIONS OF THE BOOK. THE SKILLS OF FOCUSSED READING AND FINE INTERPRETATION SHOULD BE VALUED THE CONSTITUTION, 1996 IS NOT TREATED LITERALLY ENOUGH IN OUR SOCIETY. ISSUES SUCH AS TRANSFORMATION THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLY DEFINED OR PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION ARE TREATED AS IF THEY WERE THE POINT OF THE DOCUMENT, WHEREAS AN ISSUE SUCH AS EQUALITY, WHICH IS EXPLICITLY PROVIDED FOR, DOES NOT GET THE ATTENTION IT SHOULD THE UNWRITTEN SPIRIT OF THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH IS SO OFTEN INVOKED, DOES NOT EXIST AS A UNITARY CANON OF INTERPRETATION, BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION IS THE RESULT OF CONTESTATION. THE SPIRIT UNDERLYING CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS MAY BE CONTROLLED TOO EASILY BY THE POWERFUL IF IT HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED TO WRITING. THE ROLE OF WRITING AND READING IN THE RULE OF LAW IS DISCUSSED WHEN REGULATIONS ARE MADE BY THE EXECUTIVE, OR POLICY IS APPLIED BY STREET LEVEL BUREAUCRATS, POLICY DIVERGENCE CAN OCCUR STAYING TRUE TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRES SPECIAL SKILLS AND INTELLIGENCE. NOT EVERY LETTER OF THE LAW SHOULD BE OBEYED LEGISLATION CAN BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR PATENTLY UNJUST. THEY SHOULD NOT BLINDLY BE ADHERED TO. PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE BUT STILL LEGAL OUGHT TO BE OBEYED THEY SHOULD BE AMENDED, NOT BY AN INCREMENTAL PROCESS OF GRADUAL NEGLECT AND DISOBEDIENCE, BUT BY PROCESSES OF FORMAL REVISION WITHIN A MODEL THAT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS PUNCTUATED EQUILIBRIUM. TEMPORARY OBEDIENCE TO ILL-CONCEIVED RULES IS A COST OF DEMOCRACY AND CIVILIZATION. THE ARTICLE ENDS WITH A SUGGESTION THAT WE MAY BE OBEDIENT TO THE WRONG THINGS TODAY.
558	THE SUBJECT. THE AUTHORS CREATE AN INSTRUMENTAL APPARATUS THAT SATURATES EXISTING AND EMERGING DATA NEEDS IN THE THEORY CONSTITUTING PROCESS AND THUS CREATE PRECONDITIONS FOR POLICE PRACTICE DEVELOPMENT. THE METHODOLOGY. THE RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE CONTENT ANALYSES OF FINAL RESEARCH REPORTS, THE OBJECT OF WHICH IS POLICE PROCEEDINGS AND THE SUBJECT IS POLICE REALITY, THE PURPOSE. THE AUTHORS SUBSTANTIATE THE FOLLOWING HYPOTHESIS. THE SOURCE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IN POLICE PRACTICE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICE THEORY IS A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONTRADICTION BETWEEN POLICE THEORY AND POLICE PRACTICE, WITH POLICE PRACTICE BEING THE DEFINING ASPECT OF THIS CONTRADICTORY UNITY. THE NEED AND AREAS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF ACTIVITIES IN THE POLICE PROCEEDINGS STRUCTURE ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED BY POLICE PRACTICE. THE MAIN RESULTS. BY VERIFYING POLICE PRACTICE, THE AUTHORS CONFIRM THE NECESSARY OBLIGATORY INTERACTION BETWEEN THEORY AND PRACTICE, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY DETERMINED BY THE ACHIEVED RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY RESPECT THAT SYSTEMATICALLY PROCESSED KNOWLEDGE FROM APPLIED RESEARCH CAN SHOW THE CHARACTER OF A THEORY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR KNOWLEDGE, CONSISTING OF A SYSTEM OF KNOWLEDGE PRESENTED BY THE ACHIEVED OUTPUTS FROM SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, EVALUATION AND EXPLANATION OF PHENOMENA REGISTERED IN THE PURPOSEFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES IN THE STRUCTURE OF POLICE PROCEEDINGS (RESEARCH OBJECT). THE TERM POLICE ACTION CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS A SYNTHETIC TERM FOR A HOLISTIC GRASP OF THE POLICE ACTIVITY AND ITS BODIES. THE ACTIVITY OF POLICE AND SECURITY AUTHORITIES MEANS: A SPECIAL FORM OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FOR THE STATE, SELF-GOVERNING AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND, LAST BUT NOT LEAST, CITIZENS. IT CONTAINS A SET OF EXECUTIVE, ORGANIZATIONAL, MANAGEMENT AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE THE CHARACTER OF OFFICIAL INTERVENTIONS, OFFICIAL ACTS, OTHER OFFICIAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER MEASURES. THEY ARE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, PREVENTIVE AND, WHERE NECESSARY, REPRESSIVE METHODS OF POLICE WORK. THEIR AIM IS TO PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL HU- MAN RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND SOCIETY FROM CRIME AND OTHER ANTI-SOCIAL ACTIVITIES. THEY DEFINE THE IDENTITY OF THESE PHENOMENA THROUGH THE SUBJECT (OPTICS) OF RESEARCH, SYSTEMATICALLY DEFINING THE POLICE REALITY BY THE PROCESS PARAMETERS, THEIR DETERMINANTS AND CONSTRUCTS OF SPECIFIC POLICE ACTIVITIES. IN THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER PARTICIPATE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF TASKS RELATED TO THE CONSTITUTION OF POLICE SCIENCES. THE OUTPUTS OF APPLIED RESEARCH OFFER A SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POLICE REALITY. WITH THE DIALECTICAL APPROACH, IN RELATION TO THE EXAMINED ACTIVITIES IN THE STRUCTURE OF POLICE PROCEEDINGS, THEY DEFINE THE REASONS RELATED TO THE ASSUMPTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF LINKS AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF POLICE REALITY, OR THEY REVEAL THEIR OBJECTIVE ABSENCE. BY IDENTIFYING SYSTEMS, THE AUTHORS CREATE A MODEL OF THESE PURPOSEFULLY IMPLEMENTED ACTIVITIES WITH PROPERTIES CHARACTERIZING THEIR BEHAVIOUR. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY RESPECT THAT THE STRATEGIC FORM OF THE PARAMETERS OF THIS MODEL IS EXPRESSED BY THE ACHIEVED SET INTENTIONS AND GOALS OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES. DETERMINING THEM IS A CONCENTRATED EXPRESSION OF THIS WILL. THE BASIC CONTEXT IN THEIR WORK (PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTING POLICE SCIENCES), DETERMINING THE MEANING AND MISSION, IS A SPECIFIC SUBJECT ACCEPTED BY THEM. THIS IS THE POLICE REALITY, AN OBJECTIVE FACT THAT THE THEORY OF POLICE SCIENCES EXAMINES AND USES TO EXPLAIN EXISTING AND EMERGING OBJECTS. THEREFORE, THEIR ACTIVITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTING POLICE SCIENCES CORRESPONDS TO CHANGES IN SOCIAL PROCESSES. WHEN CREATING THEIR INSTRUMENTS (CONCEPTUAL SYSTEM, CATEGORIES, THEORETICAL MODELS, FORMS OF THINKING), THEY COMBINE IT WITH THE EXPLANATION OF NEW APPROACHES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADVANCEMENT OF POLICING PROCESSES, CHARACTERIZED BY OPENNESS AND POSSIBILITIES OF SOCIAL CONTROL IN THEIR PURPOSEFUL IMPLEMENTATION. THIS CONFIRMS THAT THIS PROCESS FORMS A SYSTEM. ITS DESIGN SHOWS RELATIVE STABILITY AND CLOSENESS. THEY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INPUTS IN ITS CONTENT, JUST THOSE THAT ARE FORESEEN AND ANTICIPATED. IN THIS CONTEXT, THEY REALIZE THAT THE INTERDISCIPLINARY OF CONCEPTS ENRICHES THE VIEW OF CONSTITUTED POLICE SCIENCE. FOR THE POLICE SCIENCES, THE ABSTRACTNESS AND GENERALITY OF STATEMENTS FROM OTHER SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES IS NOT A STARTING POINT, BUT AL- READY THE RESULT OF RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC SYSTEMS (DISPOSITION OF KNOWLEDGE), SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR SCIENTIFIC WORK. IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, THE POLICE SCIENCES ARE CONSTITUTED AS PRACTICAL, SOCIAL AND SECURITY SCIENCES. THEREFORE, THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER ACCEPT THAT THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF POLICE SCIENCES REQUIRES THEM TO BE CONFRONTED AND INDEPENDENTLY DEALT WITH THE CURRENT STATE IN THE THEORY AND METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY, TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE OVERALL SCIENTIFIC ATMOSPHERE AND INDEPENDENTLY AND CRITICALLY. IN THIS PROCESS, THE MEANINGFULNESS OF THEIR SCIENTIFIC WORK IS EVIDENT. THIS CORRESPONDS TO THE REGISTERED NEEDS FOR THE TRANSFER OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE INTO POLICE PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS. FROM THESE FINDINGS IT IS CLEAR THAT IN THE CURRENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC, THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTING POLICE SCIENCES FORMS A STRUCTURED SYSTEM WITH TO THE POINT MANAGEMENT. ITS SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION IS ALSO DETERMINED BY THE RESULTS OF A CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION, THE AUTHORS PARTICIPATED IN WITH THIS PRESENTED KNOWLEDGE.
559	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA AS THE NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR AND THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT AS THE POSITIVE LEGISLATOR IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE KELSEN'S MODEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. IN SUCH A CONSTITUTIONAL-LAW MODEL, IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A SPECIAL INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS BODY TO CARRY OUT THE REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY. IN THE KELSENIAN MODEL, THIS IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. THIS IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT IN SUCH SOCIAL SYSTEMS PARLIAMENTS ARE DELEGATED WITH THE TASK OF MAKING LAWS, WHICH THEY, AS BODIES REPRESENTING THE CITIZENS, CARRY OUT FREELY AND IN LINE WITH THE POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE GOVERNING MAJORITY, SUBJECT ONLY TO CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS. THEREFORE, THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AS "POSITIVE LEGISLATORS", AS STATED BY KELSEN. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, ON THE BASIS OF ITS AUTHORITY, AS PART OF THE PROCEDURE OF REVIEWING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY OF LAWS, IS RESTRICTED TO REPEALING OR ANNULLING LAWS WHEN THEY CONFLICT WITH THE CONSTITUTION OR WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW, AND, WHEN ESTABLISHING THAT THEY ARE NOT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION OR WITH THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW, IT REMOVES THEM FROM THE LEGAL SYSTEM. KELSEN REFERRED TO THIS ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS THAT OF THE "NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR". BY REVIEWING CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY AND BY CARRYING OUT ALL OTHER COMPETENCES PROVIDED WITHIN ITS REMIT BY THE CONSTITUTION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN ITSELF AND FOR ITSELF HAS BEEN CALLED TO BE AN INTERPRETER, AND, ON THIS BASIS, TO INTERPRET THE ENTIRE CONSTITUTION. WITH THIS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, IN ADDITION TO THE TASK OF BEING THE PROTECTOR AND GUARDIAN OF THE CONSTITUTION, HAS ALSO BEEN GIVEN THE TASK OF INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION AS A WHOLE IN A DYNAMIC AND EVOLVING MANNER, AND THUS, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSTITUTIONAL-LAW PREDECESSOR, IT MAKES A CONTRIBUTION TO THE REALISATION OF THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. BY CARRYING OUT ITS TASK OF PERFORMING ITS FUNCTIONS PRESCRIBED WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA TODAY MUST PROVIDE AN ANSWER, NOT ONLY TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION, BUT ALSO TO THE MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE COMPLEX QUESTION OF WHAT IS ACCORDING TO THE LAW AND ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, BASED ON THEIR RATIO LEGIS WHICH RELIES ON THE HIGHEST VALUES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. IN ORDER TO FIND SUCH ANSWERS, BY THE NATURE OF THINGS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT MUST APPLY AN ACTIVE APPROACH WHEN INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA, BY APPLYING THE EVOLUTIONARY PRINCIPLE WITH A PRIMARILY SYSTEMATIC AND TELEOLOGICAL METHOD THAT IS APPLICABLE TO IT. NATURALLY, THIS LEADS TO THE CONTINUOUS STEPPING OUT TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT OF THE REMIT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS THE NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR INTO THE FIELD OF ACTION OF THE POSITIVE LEGISLATOR. SUCH AN APPROACH LEADS TO THE NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR INTRUDING IN DIFFERENT WAYS INTO THE FIELD OF THE POSITIVE LEGISLATOR, FROM A DIRECT AND INDIRECT TO A MIXED AND TOTAL PERFORMANCE, ALBEIT ONLY TEMPORARILY AND FOR A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, AS THE POSITIVE LEGISLATOR. REACTIONS BY THE POSITIVE LEGISLATOR TO SUCH A LEGAL SITUATION AS CREATED BY THE NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR ARE DIFFERENT AND GENERALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CASE. USING SWEET'S TERMINOLOGY, WE CAN REFER TO THIS AS "CORRECTIVE REVISION". IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT BOTH IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS THE NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR AND IN THE PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE OF THE CROATIAN PARLIAMENT WE CAN DISCERN ALL THE FORMS OF THEIR OPTIONS, WHICH HAVE AFFECTED AND DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP. I CONSIDER THAT THIS IS NOT JUST THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE WISH OF THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LEGISLATOR TO BEHAVE IN THIS WAY, BUT PRIMARILY THE CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES IN EXERCISING THEIR COMPETENCES IN ORDER TO MEET THE TASKS GIVEN TO THEM IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSITION PROCESSES WHICH THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA IS UNDERGOING ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE DEVELOPMENT ROLE THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL-LAW ORDER PROVIDES FOR THESE PROCESSES AND THE INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THIS ORDER. IT IS FORTUNATE THAT BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LEGISLATORS HAVE UNTIL TODAY KEPT A REASONABLE, PERMITTED, JUSTIFIED AND CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGITIMATE DOSE OF MUTUAL INFLUENCE IN THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP. THIS, ON THE ONE HAND, INDICATES THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES AND GOALS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEIR RESPECT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERPRETING AND APPLYING THE CONSTITUTION. IT CERTAINLY ALSO SHOWS THE WISDOM AND SKILL OF THE ACTORS TO FIND A LEGAL MEASURE IN THINGS AND A BALANCE IN THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONS, WITHOUT OVERSTEPPING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITIES AND RESTRICTIONS.
560	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A RESOLUTION OF THE MARITIME DISPUTES IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA MUST BE BASED UPON A UNIVERSALIST FRAMEWORK WHERE THE MARITIME INTERESTS OF THE WORLD ARE UPHELD. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE UNIVERSALIST FRAMEWORK OF THE 1982 UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (UNCLOS) AND THE UNIVERSALIST APPROACH TAKEN BY THE TRIBUNAL ON 12 JULY 2016 IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA ARBITRATION REGARDING THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF A STATE'S EXCEPTIONALIST MARITIME CLAIMS AND THE ADOPTION OF STRICT CRITERIA FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF FEATURES AT SEA.
561	SPACE WEAPONIZATION SHOULD BE PREVENTED BECAUSE OF ITS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE LONG-TERM SUSTAIN -ABILITY OF OUTER SPACE ACTIVITIES (LTSOSA). INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT CURRENTLY GOVERNS WEAPONIZATION IN OUTER SPACE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, AND INTERNATIONAL RULES THAT PERTAIN TO THE LTSOSA SHOULD IMPOSE DIRECT AND INDIRECT SOFT-LAW CONSTRAINTS ON SPACE WEAPONIZATION. NEVERTHELESS, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ROLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN INHIBITING SPACE WEAPONIZATION ARE LIMITED, AND A LEGAL LACUNA STILL EXISTS IN THE GOVERNANCE OF CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT. INDEPENDENT AND MORE FOCUSED DISCUSSIONS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO SPACE SECURITY ARE RECOMMENDED GIVEN THAT THE DISAGREEMENT ON RELATED ISSUES HAS PREVENTED REAL PROGRESS FROM BEING MADE DURING MULTILATERAL DISCUSSIONS ADDRESSING THE SPACE TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE USED IN A HOSTILE MANNER. THE INTEGRATION OF SOME NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE SPACE ACTIVITY INTO THE NEW LTSOSA GUIDELINES DISCUSSED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMITTEE ON THE PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE IS ALSO RECOMMENDED, ALONG WITH AN ONGOING STRONG POLITICAL CONSTRAINT ON THE DEPLOYMENT AND TESTING OF DEDICATED SPACE WEAPONS IN OUTER SPACE THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION. THE LATTER IS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE UNDER THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO PRESERVE THE LTSOSA BY WORKING AGAINST THE WEAPONIZATION OF OUTER SPACE. (C) 2022 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
562	ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTION IS ESSENTIAL TO SATISFY WOMEN'S NEED FOR HEALTHCARE AND CONTROL OVER THEIR LIFE CHOICES. MODERN REGULATION OF ABORTION APPEARS TO BE FEMALE FRIENDLY BECAUSE IT ABANDONS THE OLD OPPRESSIVE APPEARANCE AND WEARS A LIBERAL FACE. BY EXAMINING THE IMAGES OF "GLORIOUS MOTHERS" AND "RATIONAL WOMEN" CONSTRUCTED BY THE CHINESE AND ENGLISH REGULATORY MODELS OF ABORTION THROUGH A FEMINIST LENS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO OFFER A MORE CRITICAL RESPONSE TO THE TWO JURISDICTIONS. FURTHERMORE, BY COMPARING THE TWO MODELS OF ABORTION LAW, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES FEMINISTS AND REFORMERS WITH A CHANCE TO LEARN ABOUT EACH OTHER'S EXPERIENCES AND DIFFERENT REGULATORY STRATEGIES. AS A RESULT, THEY WILL BE ABLE TO VIEW THE MERITS AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR NATIONAL ABORTION LAW FROM A FRESH ANGLE. FINALLY, THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY OFFERS A BASIS FOR FEASIBLE LAW REFORM PROPOSALS THAT WOULD EMPOWER WOMEN IN DECISION MAKING CONCERNING ABORTION.
563	IMMIGRATION TO RICH DEMOCRACIES GREW SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE 1990S AND 2000S. WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE RISE OF IMMIGRATION INFLUENCED THE NOVEL AND SALIENT OUTCOME OF PREFERENCES FOR GREATER LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENDING. WE PROPOSE THAT THESE PREFERENCES ARE CONSEQUENTIAL FOR POLICYMAKING, REFLECT POPULAR DEMAND FOR PUNITIVE SOCIAL CONTROL, AND REPRESENT MICRO-LEVEL PREFERENCES UNDERLYING THE POLITICS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. MOTIVATED BY LITERATURES ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLITICS, MINORITY THREAT, AND THE FEAR OF CRIME, WE EXAMINE WHETHER STOCKS AND FLOWS OF IMMIGRATION INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PREFERENCES FOR GREATER LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENDING. USING INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SURVEY PROGRAMME (ISSP) DATA, WE ANALYZE BETWEEN-COUNTRY VARIATION WITH MULTI-LEVEL MODELS OF 25 COUNTRIES IN 2006, AND WITHIN-COUNTRY VARIATION WITH DIFFERENCES-IN-DIFFERENCES (DD) MODELS OF 16 COUNTRIES WITH AVAILABLE DATA IN BOTH 1996 AND 2006. BOTH MULTILEVEL AND DD MODELS SHOW THAT FLOWS OF IMMIGRATION INCREASE PREFERENCES FOR GREATER LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENDING. INDEED, THE COEFFICIENTS FOR IMMIGRATION FLOWS ARE LARGER THAN OR COMPARABLE IN MAGNITUDE TO THE COEFFICIENTS FOR ANY OTHER VARIABLE, AND ARE ROBUST NET OF HOMICIDE RATES AND POLICE OFFICERS PER 100,000. BY CONTRAST, THE STOCK OF IMMIGRANTS IS NOT ROBUSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENCES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT RISING IMMIGRATION CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR GREATER LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENDING.
564	IN THE PAST DECADE NATIONAL LAWMAKING FOR REGULATING COMMERCE HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY GLOBALIZATION AND THE TRANSPLANTATION OF FOREIGN LAWS. THE NEW CHINESE ENTERPRISE BANKRUPTCY LAW ENACTED IN 2006 WAS MODELED CLOSELY ON THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE, ESPECIALLY CHAPTER 11, WHICH PUTS THE BARGAINING GAME AT THE CENTER OF CORPORATE REORGANIZATION. LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS NOT YET COMPREHENSIVELY EXPLORED HOW BUSINESS LAW TRANSPLANTS FROM A MARKET ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF THE UNITED STATES TO A SOCIALISTIC MARKET ECONOMY LIKE THAT OF CHINA. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN IN-DEPTH COMPARISON OF THE REORGANIZATION BARGAINING REGIMES OF BANKRUPTCY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, FOCUSING ON THE SOCIO-LEGAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THESE REGIMES OPERATE. THE COMPARISON SHOWS HOW THE BARGAINING GAME AT THE CORE OF CHAPTER 11 SUFFERS FROM OBSTRUCTED EFFICIENCY WHEN TRANSPLANTED TO A CHINESE CONTEXT, ART OBSTRUCTION CAUSED BY HISTORICAL, POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL FACTORS.
565	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO RESEARCHING OF THE BOOK, WHICH WITTILY CALLED "NOMENCLATURE KAMASUTRA: OFFICE ROMANCE IN BREZHNEV PERIOD". THIS IS THE MEMORIES, WRITTEN BY S.D.BEZCLUBENKO - THE FORMER MINISTER OF CULTURE IN SOVIET UKRAINE. S.B.RUDENKO ANALYZED VIEWS OF BEZCLUBENKO ON SUCH QUALITIES OF POLITICIANS IN SOVIET UNION AS THE PROFESSIONALISM, THEIR INTELLECTUAL LEVEL, MORAL VALUES. UNDER REVIEW WERE ALSO STRUGGLE FOR POWER BETWEEN PARTOCRATS, PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT CAREER OF BOSSES OF NOMENCLATURE, FEATURES OF THESE PROCESSES IN UKRAINE. RUDENKO COMPARES THE RESEARCH RESULTS S.D.BEZKLUBENKO AND OTHER RESEARCHERS NOMENCLATURE: M.S.VOSLENSKI AND M.BILAS. FOR ALL, WHO INTERESTING IN SOVIET POLITICAL CULTURE. SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE SOVIET ERA IS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE BECAUSE MODERN UKRAINIAN POLITICS CARRIES A LOT OF GENETIC TRAITS THAT TIME. RESEARCH INTEREST PRIMARILY IS POLITICAL CULTURE OF USSR RULERS - NOMENCLATURE. THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF LACK OF PAPERS DEVOTED TO THIS TOPIC. THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION WAS A VERY CLOSED. THAT IS WHY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AMONG SOURCES OF RESEARCH PLAYS MEMOIRS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF NOMENCLATURE. ONE OF THESE SOURCES OF RESEARCH IS "NOMENCLATURE KAMASUTRA ... " WRITTEN BY BEZCLUBENKO. THE CENTRAL CONCEPT OF THE STUDY IS THE "NOMENCLATURE". THE AUTHOR OF "NOMENCLATURE KAMASUTRA ... " GIVES THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION OF THIS TERM: SELECTION OF PERSONNEL FOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS AMONG PARTY BOSSES, WHAT BASED ON COMPILING A LIST OF THE NAMES OF CERTAIN POSITIONS AND NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE CONSIDERED AS CANDIDATES FOR THEIR FILLING. EACH PARTY ORGAN HAD A LEVEL OF "NOMENCLATURE", WHICH IN TURN ALSO DIVIDED INTO "MAIN NOMENCLATURE" (THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE PARTY ORGAN, WHICH TOOK THE DECISION TO APPOINT) AND "ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL NOMENCLATURE" (THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE HIGHER PARTY ORGAN, WHO HAS CONSENTED TO THE APPOINTMENT). BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF M.BILAS, DEVELOPED IN THE WORKS M.S.VOSLENSKI [3], THE NOMENCLATURE IS THE RULING CLASS IN THE COUNTRIES OF "REAL SOCIALISM", WHICH IN ESSENCE WAS INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATIVE FEUDALISM (NON STATE CAPITALISM). NOMENCLATURE IS NOT THE SAME BUREAUCRACY. THIS IS A SOCIAL CLASS SUCH AS MEDIEVAL NOBILITY. IT PENETRATED ALL SPHERES OF PUBLIC LIFE AND DELEGATES POWERS EXCLUSIVELY OWN REPRESENTATIVES. THE NOMENCLATURE AS SOCIAL CLASS CAN NOT BE EQUATED WITH ALMOST 18 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN THE EARLY 80'S OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. DRAMATURGY MEMOIR BUILT AROUND THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN BEZCLUBENKO, THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE OF SOVIET UKRAINE, AND HIS CURATOR FROM CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF COMMUNIST PARTY OF UKRAINE KAPTO. THIS CONFLICT DISPLAYS ARSENAL OF METHODS OF POLITICAL STRUGGLE, CHARACTERIZING NOMENCLATURE ENVIRONMENT. KAPTO WAS A ZEALOUS DEFENDER OF POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE NOMENCLATURE. BEZKLUBENKO MANY DECISIONS WAS TAKEN AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION (WITHIN THE POWERS OF MINISTER), WITHOUT COORDINATION WITH HIS IMMEDIATE BOSS PARTY KAPTO, IN VIOLATION OF UNSHAKABLE HIERARCHY OF SOVIET POWER. NOTE THE FOLLOWING REALITIES OF THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE SOVIET RULERS. BECAUSE PERSONNEL DECISIONS ARE THE PREROGATIVE OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF UKRAINE, IN THE APPARATUS OF THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE WERE INTRODUCED PEOPLE WHO WORKED AGAINST THE MINISTER AND PERFORMED THE ORDERS OF KAPTO. IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE MINISTER AND PARTOCRAT PLAYED THE SOVIET SECRET POLICE - THE KGB. HEREWITH RELATIONS WITH THE KGB USED AS ONE, AND THE OTHER PARTY TO THE CONFLICT. BEZKLUBENKO WITH UNDISGUISED CONTEMPT BELONGED TO HIS BOSS KAPTO. IN HIS OPINION KAPTO WAS UNCULTURED, IGNORANT AND NOT CLEVER PERSON. AT THE SAME TIME, AMONG SOVIET "NOBILITY CONSIDERED THE NORM TO ZEALOUS ATTITUDE TO THE GUIDANCE, DESPITE ITS MORAL, INTELLECTUAL AND PROFESSIONAL QUALITIES, ALWAYS SHEW HIM RESPECT. BEZKLUBENKO THOUGHT THAT BUSINESS SKILLS ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT. BUT FOR POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE NOMENCLATURE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY WAS LOYALTY TO THEIR SOCIAL CLASS. THE PERMANENT STRUGGLE FOR POWER WAS THE ESSENCE OF ITS EXISTENCE. MINISTER BEZKLUBENKO HAD VERY STRONG POSITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF UKRAINE. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE MINISTER TO THE HONORARY ELECTORAL NOMENCLATURE - CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND PARLIAMENT OF UKRAINE. POLITICAL FRIENDS OF BEZKLUBENKO WERE, IN PARTICULAR, PRODAN AND VRUBLEVSKI ASSISTANTS OF THE FIRST SECRETARY SHCHERBYTSKY, SECOND SECRETARY OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF UKRAINE SOKOLOV. LOYAL TO THE MINISTER WAS, CREDIBLY, SHCHERBYTSKY. PERHAPS, THE FIRST SECRETARY WAS IMPRESSED PROFESSIONALISM AND FOUGHT OF REBELLIOUS BEZCLUBENKO. BUT, CONFLICT BETWEEN VEIWS ON THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF BEZKLUBENKO, AND VERSION OF POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE NOMENCLATURE AS SOCIAL CLASS , WAS OBVIOUS. THEREFORE, WHEN VRUBLEVSKY HAD LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE MINISTER OF CULTURE, DISCREPANCY POLITICAL CULTURE OF NOMENCLATURE WAS THE REASON FOR DISMISSAL FROM THE POST OF BEZKLUBENKO. THE BOOK OF BEZCLUBENKO "NOMENCLATURE KAMASUTRA. OFFICE ROMANCE IN BREZHNEV PERIOD" IS A VALUABLE SOURCE FOR THE STUDY OF POLITICAL CULTURE IN SOVIET UKRAINE IN 60-80 YEARS OF XX CENTURY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR NOT CONSIDERING THE NOMENCLATURE AS CLASS, HOWEVER, CLEARLY REVEALS SPECIFICITY OF POLITICAL MANAGEMENT OF SOVIET CHIEFS. USING SPECIFIC EXAMPLES, HE SHOWS THE PARASITIC NATURE OF NOMENCLATURE, DISDAIN OF PROFESSIONALISM IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT OF PROFESSIONALISM, TRAMPLING OF RULE OF LAW, MIMICRY OF DEMOCRACY, OBSESSION OWN CAREER INTERESTS, COMMUNICATION LIKE IN THE MAFIA AMONG THE NOMENCLATURE BOSSES.
566	JURISDICTIONAL RULES DIFFER ALL OVER THE WORLD. PLAINTIFFS MIGHT CONSIDER JURISDICTIONAL PRACTICES IN ONE LEGAL SYSTEM AS "HEAVEN", WHEREAS DEFENDANTS WILL FEAR EXACTLY THESE RULES LIKE "HELL". DUE TO INCREASING GLOBAL INTERCONNECTEDNESS THAT RESULTS FROM INCREASING CROSS-BORDER TRADE, FROM THE MOBILITY OF PEOPLE, AND THE GLOBAL REACH OF THE INTERNET, THERE IS A NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON MATTERS OF JURISDICTION ON SEVERAL LEVELS. THE FIRST LEVEL CONCERNS THE QUESTION WHETHER A COMPLETE SET OF ACCEPTABLE GROUNDS OF JURISDICTION (DIRECT GROUNDS OF JURISDICTIONS) CAN BE DEVELOPED FOR A BINDING INSTRUMENT. ON THE SECOND LEVEL THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO TOLERABLE HEADS OF JURISDICTION (ONLY) FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS (INDIRECT GROUNDS OF JURISDICTION). AND FINALLY THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS THAT RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE THE FOREIGN JUDGMENT IS AT ISSUE. THE HAGUE CONFERENCE ON PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS RESUMED ITS WORK ON THE SO-CALLED JUDGMENT PROJECT AND IT IS WORKING ON ALL THREE LEVELS ALTHOUGH DIRECT GROUNDS OF JURISDICTION WILL BE TACKLED ONLY AFTER A CERTAIN AGREEMENT WILL HAVE BEEN REACHED ON JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES CONCERNING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS. HOWEVER, ON ALL THREE LEVELS THE INCLUSION AND THE ROLE OF THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT AND MOST DECISIVE ISSUE. THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS HAS ITS ORIGIN IN THE COMMON LAW WORLD, BUT HAS SPREAD AROUND THE GLOBE IN RECENT DECADES. TODAY IT CAN BE FOUND ALSO IN JURISDICTIONS WHICH TRADITIONALLY APPLY STRICT JURISDICTIONAL RULES. THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE DOCTRINE IS A MARGIN OF DISCRETION THE COMPETENT COURT MAY APPLY IN STAYING OR REJECTING LITIGATION. THIS APPLIES IF IN THE GIVEN SITUATION THE COURT ADDRESSED SEEMS TO BE A "NOT CONVENIENT" FORUM AND THERE IS ANOTHER MORE APPROPRIATE FORUM. THE PARTICULARS OF THE DOCTRINE AS WELL AS THE STANDARDS OF THE TEST (INCONVENIENT, CLEARLY INCONVENIENT, MORE APPROPRIATE) AND THE DETERMINATIVE CONSIDERATIONS VARY. BY CONTRAST, IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE EUROPEAN RULES ON JURISDICTION ARE AND HAVE TO BE STRICT RULES IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY. HOWEVER, A CLOSE LOOK AT THESE JURISDICTIONAL SYSTEMS IN EUROPEAN REGULATIONS REVEAL SOME WEAKNESS OF THE STRICT RULES ON THE ONE HAND AND ALSO THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THESE SYSTEMS A NON-CONVENIENCE SUBSTITUTE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. THERE ARE RULES WHICH ALLOW COURTS TO DENY JURISDICTION BY WAY OF INTERPRETING A JURISDICTIONAL RULE RESTRICTIVELY IN THE LIGHT OF SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE AT HAND. THERE ARE OTHER RULES WHICH GIVE JUDGES A LIMITED POWER TO DECLINE (OR IN CASE OF A FORUM NECESSITATIS EVEN TO ATTRACT) JURISDICTION OUTSIDE THE NORMAL RULES. IN THIS SITUATION FORUM NON CONVENIENS-TYPE CONSIDERATIONS ARE AT ISSUE. IN SO FAR THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS IN A GLOBAL INSTRUMENT CONCERNING JURISDICTION EVEN FOR CONTINENTAL-EUROPEAN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE EU AS SUCH DOES NOT SEEM UNTHINKABLE ANY MORE. THIS APPLIES ESPECIALLY AS FAR AS DIRECT JURISDICTION IS CONCERNED. GLOBALIZATION OF THE MARKETS AND OF SOCIETIES AS WELL AS THE DELOCALISATION OF THE CONNECTING FACTORS ASK FOR WIDE JURISDICTIONAL RULES WHICH MAY HAVE TO BE RESTRICTED WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIFIC AND LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PRECISE FACTS OF A CASE. CONCERNS ABOUT "ACCESS TO JUSTICE", "THE RIGHT TO A LAWFUL JUDGE", NON-DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS, PREDICTABILITY AND CERTAINTY OF THE JURISDICTIONAL SYSTEM CAN BE REBUTTED IF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A RULE ON FORUM NON CONVENIENS ARE FRAMED ACCORDINGLY: A PRESUMPTION THAT HONOURS THE PLAINTIFF'S CHOICE OF COURT MAY ONLY BE REBUTTED, IF THE DEFENDANT PROVES THAT THE INTERESTS OF BOTH PARTIES AND THE END OF JUSTICE JUSTIFY A STAY OR DENIAL OF THE PROCEEDINGS. HE WILL HAVE TO PROVE IN ADDITION THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROPRIATE FORUM WHICH GUARANTEES A LAWFUL PROCEDURE AND A POSSIBILITY FOR THE PLAINTIFF TO ENFORCE HIS RIGHT WHEN GRANTED BY THIS ALTERNATIVE COURT. MUCH WILL DEPEND ON THE PHRASING OF THE RULE, BUT THERE ARE MODELS FOR ORIENTATION. WHEN IT COMES TO INDIRECT JURISDICTION THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE UNITED STATES. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT AN AGREEMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WILL BE REACHED WITHOUT COPING WITH THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER, FORUM NON CONVENIENS MAY HAVE A VERY LIMITED ROLE ON THIS LEVEL ONLY. DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN SO FAR PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE ORIGINAL FORUM IN ADJUDICATING THE CASE ARE NOT AT ISSUE ANY MORE, THE ESSENTIAL ISSUE WILL BE WHETHER THE INTERESTS OF THE DEFENDANT HAVE BEEN TREATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS COULD BE ARGUED UNDER THE HEAD OF "ORDRE PUBLIC", BUT IT SEEMS PREFERABLE TO DEFINE THE LIMITS OF SUCH EXCEPTION EXPRESSLY. FINALLY, THE JURISDICTIONAL RULES OF THE COURTS RECOGNIZING AND ENFORCING FOREIGN JUDGMENTS ARE OF PIVOTAL IMPORTANCE. WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF ENFORCEMENT A RIGHT MAY BE THEORETICAL AND ILLUSIONARY ONLY. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE RIGHTS, A LEGAL SYSTEM MUST NOT REFRAIN FROM ENFORCING A JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS IF AND SO FAR AS THIS JUDGMENT HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THIS SYSTEM. THUS, ON THE THIRD STAGE OF JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE THE DOCTRINE OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS SHOULD NOT PLAY ANY ROLE AT ALL.
567	CHINA'S ECONOMIC BOOM HAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DARK SIDE. WHILE CHINA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW AT A RATE OF MORE THAN 8% ANNUALLY, AS IT HAS FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES, THE COUNTRY'S ENVIRONMENT AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE PAYING A STEEP PRICE. CHINA NOW BOASTS FIVE OF THE TEN MOST POLLUTED CITIES IN THE WORLD; 70% OF THE WATER THAT FLOWS THROUGH CHINA'S URBAN AREAS IS UNFIT FOR DRINKING OR FISHING; AND SEVERELY DEGRADED LAND OR DESERT, WHICH NOW CLAIMS 1/4 OF CHINA'S LAND, IS ADVANCING AT A RATE OF 1300 SQ. MILES PER YEAR. AS NATHAN NANKIVELL POINTS OUT, THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS POSES A CHALLENGE FOR CHINA'S LEADERS ON THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENTAL TERMS. THE ENVIRONMENT IS BITING BACK INTO ECONOMIC GROWTH: REGIONS FROM QINGHAI TO SHENZHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FROM LACK OF WATER; COUNTRYWIDE, THESE ECONOMIC LOSSES TOTALED $28 BILLION IN 2003 AND THE CHALLENGE IS ONLY INCREASING. OVERALL COSTS TO CHINA'S ECONOMY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND DEGRADATION ARE ESTIMATED AT 8-12% OF GDP ANNUALLY. ENVIRONMENT-RELATED PUBLIC HEALTH IS A SECOND SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. CHINESE OFFICIALS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT 300 MILLION PEOPLE DRINK CONTAMINATED WATER ON A DAILY BASIS, AND OF THESE, 190 MILLION DRINK WATER THAT IS SO CONTAMINATED THAT IT IS MAKING THEM SICK. FINALLY, THE FAILURE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO REDRESS ITS ENVIRONMENT-RELATED ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS HAS PRODUCED WIDESPREAD SOCIAL DISCONTENT. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTESTS ARE A SERIOUS SOURCE OF LOCALIZED SOCIAL INSTABILITY THAT IN NUMEROUS, WIDELY-REPORTED CASES OVER THE PAST YEAR ALONE, HAVE TURNED VIOLENT. FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD, HOW CHINA RESPONDS TO ITS ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS HAS ENORMOUS IMPLICATIONS. NANKIVELL OUTLINES SOME POTENTIAL FUTURE SCENARIOS THAT SUGGEST JUST HOW SERIOUS A THREAT CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES MIGHT BE TO GLOBAL SECURITY. ALREADY, THROUGHOUT ASIA AND BEYOND, CHINA'S CONTRIBUTION TO TRANSBORDER AIR AND WATER POLLUTION PROVOKES SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. RUSSIA'S HARSH CRITICISM OF CHINA'S HANDLING OF THE RECENT TRANSBORDER WATER POLLUTION DISASTER THAT POISONED THE WATER FOR THE TWELVE MILLION RESIDENTS OF HARBIN AND MANY OTHERS SUGGESTS THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT. GLOBALLY, CHINA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CONTRIBUTORS TO CLIMATE CHANGE, OZONE DEPLETION, AND BIODIVERSITY LOSS, AND IT IS NOW IN THE EARLY STAGES OF FOLLOWING THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER RICH NATIONS IN A RACE TOWARD MASS AUTOMOBILE OWNERSHIP WHOSE IMPLICATIONS FOR AIR POLLUTION AND GLOBAL WARNING ARE PROFOUND. CAN CHINA CHANGE ITS ENVIRONMENTAL TRAJECTORY? THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE SIGNS. WHILE QUADRUPLING ITS GDP BETWEEN 1980 AND 2000, CHINA'S ENERGY INCREASED ONLY TWOFOLD, SUGGESTING A RECOGNITION OF IMPROVED EFFICIENCY. AND THE CHINESE STATE MONITORS POLLUTION AT 300,000 FACTORIES. FORMALLY REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS NOW TOTAL MORE THAN 2000 IN CHINA, AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS, WITH THE HELP OF THE CHINESE MEDIA AND SOME OUTSPOKEN CHINESE OFFICIALS, ARE PRESSING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS TO BE OPENLY CONDUCTED, BRINGING LAWSUITS AGAINST POLLUTING FACTORIES, AND EVEN ATTEMPTING TO HALT MEGADAM CONSTRUCTION. IN SOME WEALTHIER CHINESE CITIES, SUCH AS DALIAN AND SHANGHAI, PROACTIVE LEADERS HAVE INCREASED THE SHARE OF LOCAL FUNDS DEVOTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. NANKIVELL CALLS FOR GREATER ASSISTANCE BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IN FACT, INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL NGOS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD BANK ARE ALL DEEPLY ENGAGED IN CONTRIBUTING TO CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION EFFORT. INDEED, BY ONE ACCOUNT, INTERNATIONAL NGOS NOW ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS THREE FOURTHS OF FUNDING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IN CHINA. IT IS NEVERTHELESS DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE THE IMPRESSION THAT, THUS FAR, THE COMBINED EFFORTS AMOUNT TO CHASING A PROBLEM THAT IS GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS, AND THAT EFFORTS TO REVERSE THE JUGGERNAUT APPEAR RATHER LIKE THE APPLICATION OF BAND AIDS OVER GAPING WOUNDS. IN THE END, THE POSSIBILITIES FOR SLOWING AND EVENTUALLY REVERSING ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS WILL HAVE TO COME THROUGH THE CONCERTED EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN COMBINATION WITH THE AGENCY OF VIGOROUS AND INFORMED STATES. IN CHINA, AS IN THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND ELSEWHERE, THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE WILL BE CRUCIAL. BUT THEY WILL ALSO REFLECT THE PRESSURES FROM THE CITIZENRY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE GODS OF ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL DEFINITIONS OF MODERNITY (THE PRIVATE AUTOMOBILE MOST IMPORTANTLY) EXERCISE POWERFUL SWAY. CRITICAL GAPS IN CHINA'S DOMESTIC POLICY MILIEU WILL HAVE TO BE REVERSED, AND FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS ABOUT NATIONAL PRIORITIES WILL HAVE TO BE RECONCEIVED, IF THAT NATION IS TO AVOID THE CRIPPLING CONSEQUENCES OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION AND CONTRIBUTING MASSIVELY TO GLOBAL WARMING. CHIEF AMONG THESE ARE CORRUPTION, LOW LEVELS OF INVESTMENT IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, A LACK OF INCENTIVES TO DO THE RIGHT THING, STILL NASCENT PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW, A PRIMACY ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND POOR TRANSPARENCY. THE ISSUES, HOWEVER, ARE HARDLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHINA ALONE AS THE UNITED STATES' REJECTION OF THE KYOTO ENVIRONMENTAL ACCORDS MAKES PLAIN. INDEED, WHILE THE UNITED STATES IS BOTH THE LARGEST SOURCE OF GLOBAL WARMING AND THE MAJOR OBSTACLE TO AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE INTERNATIONAL POLICY, CHINA HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT ALLY IN EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE REALIZATION OF MEANINGFUL GLOBAL STANDARDS TO RESTRICT GREENHOUSE GASES AND ADDRESS OTHER GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. IF NOT ADDRESSED, ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WILL DRAG CHINA-AND THE REST OF THE WORLD ALONG WITH IT-DEEPER INTO AN ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS AND FURTHER ALONG THE PATH OF NANKIVELL'S DARK SCENARIOS.
568	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STALES OF AMERICA (SCOTUS), THE TWO APPELLATE COURTS OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (ECJ) IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE LATTER THREE COURTS DO NOT HAVE A HISTORY OR TRACK RECORD IN MATTERS INVOLVING FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS SCOTUS. THE MAIN FOCUS HAS CONSEQUENTLY BEEN ON THIS COURT, WITH A MORE INCISIVE EXAMINATION OF ITS ROLE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE STUDY PRESENTS ESSENTIAL MATERIAL AND ANALYSIS ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS BY ALL FOUR COURTS THROUGH THEIR DECISIONS, PRESENTATIONS AND BRIEFS TO THE COURTS, SCHOLARLY CONTRIBUTIONS AND RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS. SCOTUS IS NOT CHARGED EXPLICITLY BY THE CONSTITUTION WITH ANY RESPONSIBILITY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. IT DOES, HOWEVER, EMBODY THE CRUCIAL PRINCIPLES OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND CHECKS AND BALANCES. TOGETHER WITH THE DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT THE COURT EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN 1803, SCOTUS IS ASSURED OF BEING A FORMIDABLE FORCE IN US SOCIETY - AND ONE NO LESS IN THAT COUNTRY'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS FROM A VERY EARLY STAGE. IN THE PAST 25 YEARS SCOTUS HAS DEALT MORE AND MORE WITH ISSUES PERTAINING TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT THE EXECUTIVE PAID THE PRICE WHEN SCOTUS STARTED CUTTING THE PRESIDENT DOWN TO CONSTITUTIONAL SIZE. THEREFORE, WHILE SCOTUS MAY NOT FORMULATE FOREIGN POLICY, NOR ENGAGE IN RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN ENTITIES, MANY JUDICIAL ACTIONS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AFFECT FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE POINT IS THUS NOT WHETHER THE JUDICIARY HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BUT RATHER HOW GREAT ITS INFLUENCE IS. THE STAGE HAS NOW BEEN REACHED WHERE THE PRESIDENT CAN NO LONGER MERELY ASSUME THAT HIS ACTIONS-DEFINED AS CONSTITUTIONAL OVERREACH - WILL NOT BE CRITICALLY SCRUTINISED AND HE HIMSELF EVEN BE REBUKED THE COURT HAS THUS DETERMINED THAT THE POINT HAS BEEN REACHED THAT A PRESIDENT HAS TO BE CALLED CONSTITUTIONALLY TO ORDER WHEN HE HAS GONE TOO FAR. THE CONCLUSION REACHED IS THAT SCOTUS IS A DE FACTO ELEMENT IN US FOREIGN AFFAIRS. SCOTUS DOES DECIDE CASES THAT AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE USA WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD; AND AS THE JUSTICES DECIDE THESE CASES, THEY ARE DOING AS MUCH AS ANYONE TO INFLUENCE US FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE COURT'S PRONOUNCEMENTS IN AN AGE OF GLOBALISATION, INTERNATIONAL TERROR, ECONOMIC TURMOIL AND, NOW LATELY, ALSO WITH THE EVER GROWING INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON IMMIGRATION, AND THEIR CONSEQUENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS ARE NOT TO BE UNDERESTIMATED CONSEQUENTLY, THE STAGE IS SET FOR A GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF SCOTUS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS THAN BEFORE. THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL AUTHORITY IN SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT SHIED AWAY FROM INVOLVING ITSELF IN ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WHILE NOT ENOUGH CASES HAVE AS YET BEEN DECIDED TO SERVE AS A STUDY EQUAL IN SCOPE TO THAT HANDLED BY SCOTUS, THESE TWO SOUTH AFRICAN COURTS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED BENCHMARK CASES. WITH A DETERMINED APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, THEIR RULINGS HAVE ALREADY LEFT AN INDELIBLE REMINDER THAT THE JUDICIARY WILL NOT BE KEPT FROM ADJUDICATING CASES THAT MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE COUNTRY'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS. WITH ITS STERN REPRIMANDS IN THESE CASES, THE TWO COURTS HAVE LIVED UP TO THEIR ROLE OF UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW IN EXEMPLARY FASHION. THEIR RULINGS CARRIED ANOTHER EQUALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE: THE JUDICIARY HAS AN UNMISTAKABLE ROLE TO PLAY IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. IN DOING SO THESE TWO COURTS WILL NOT ONLY HOLD THE EXECUTIVE TO THE PRINCIPLES ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT ALSO KEEP THE EXECUTIVE WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS. FROM ITS INCEPTION, THE ECJ HAS BEEN AN UNUSUAL INTERNATIONAL FORUM FOR THE EU. OVER THE YEARS IT HAS EXPANDED ITS JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY WELL BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL, NARROW BOUNDARIES. ITS INFLUENCE HAS BECOME MORE APPARENT AND CONTESTED. CONTRARIWISE, THE ECJ HAS BEEN HAILED AS THE MOST POWERFUL SUPRANATIONAL COURT IN WORLD HISTORY. IT HAS ALREADY HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE EU 'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS BY PLACING HUMAN RIGHTS UNEQUIVOCALLY AT THE HEART OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER. IT SECURED AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN FIGHTING TERRORISM AND PROTECTING THOSE RIGHTS. THE COURT'S CENTRAL ARGUMENT WAS THAT THE PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FORMS PART OF THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE EU 'S LEGAL ORDER WHEREBY THE COURT IS COMMITTED TO GUIDE THE EU IN ITS FOREIGN AFFAIRS. IN DOING SO THE COURT HAS ENSURED THAT ALL EU ACTIONS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH AND IN HARMONY WITH OBLIGATIONS ENCOMPASSED IN ALL EU TREATIES. OVER SIX DECADES THE ECJ HAS GROWN INTO A FORMIDABLE FORCE, SO MUCH SO THAT IT HAS NOT ENDEARED ITSELF TO THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN THE BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE UK AND THE EU, THE ECJ HAS BECOME A MAJOR BONE OF CONTENTION. WHILE THE POLITICAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT MOST DIRECTLY DETERMINE OUTCOMES IN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE JUDICIARY ARE NO LESS SIGNIFICANT. MANY QUESTIONS IMPACTING ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS REQUIRE CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATIONS RELATING TO THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES. ONLY THE JUDICIARY POSSESSES THE AUTHORITY TO INTERPRET CONSTITUTIONAL AND TREATY STIPULATIONS. IN DOING SO JUDICIAL DECISIONS DEFINE THE PARAMETERS AND BOUNDARIES WITHIN WHICH THE POLITICAL BRANCHES CAN AND SHOULD OPERATE IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND MOST DEFINITELY ALSO IN THE FOREIGN A F FAIRS OF THE USA, SOUTH AFRICA AND THE EU.
569	SHOULD RADIOLOGICAL AGE ASSESSMENT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEANS OF ALLEVIATING THE DOUBTS OF A DECISION MAKER IN THE ASYLUM PROCEDURE? THE PRESENT ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION THROUGH A NUMBER OF STEPS. FIRST, IT QUESTIONS WHETHER THE USE OF RADIOLOGICAL IMAGING METHODS IN THE AGE ASSESSMENT OF UNACCOMPANIED ADOLESCENTS SEEKING ASYLUM COMPLIES WITH THE INTERNAL NORMS OF THE FORENSIC SCIENCE COMMUNITY. IT DOES NOT. SECONDLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER THE USE OF THESE METHODS IS SCIENTIFICALLY AUTHORITATIVE ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART IN FORENSIC MEDICINE AND TRAUMATOLOGY. IT IS NOT. THIRDLY, THE ARTICLE ASKS WHETHER THEIR USE SUFFICIENTLY SAFEGUARDS AGAINST A PARTICULAR KIND OF COMMUNICATIVE ERROR BETWEEN DECISION MAKERS AND EXPERTS. IT DOES NOT. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD ADVICE FROM A MEDICAL EXPERT WHO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SCIENTIFIC ISSUES ENUMERATED IN THIS ARTICLE CAN NEVER DISPEL DOUBT ABOUT AN APPLICANT'S AGE. ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 25(5) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) RECAST ASYLUM PROCEDURES DIRECTIVE, THIS PREVAILING DOUBT WILL AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE APPLICANT IS A CHILD, WHICH IS THE ARTICLE'S FOURTH AND FINAL ARGUMENT.
570	IN THIS OPINION PAPER WE SUBMIT THAT WATER EXPERTS CONDUCT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE MORE URGENT CHALLENGES FACING THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY. FIVE SPECIFIC BIASES ARE IDENTIFIED. FIRST, RESEARCH IN THE FIELD OF WATER AND SANITATION IS HEAVILY BIASED AGAINST SANITATION. SECOND, RESEARCH ON FOOD SECURITY IS BIASED IN FAVOUR OF CONVENTIONAL IRRIGATION AND FAILS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF RAINFED AGRICULTURE. THIRD, INSUFFICIENT WATER RESEARCH IS DEDICATED TO DEVELOPMENTAL COMPARED TO ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. FOURTH, TOO LITTLE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED ON ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. AND FINALLY, RESEARCH ON WATER GOVERNANCE HAS A FASCINATION FOR CONFLICT BUT TOO LITTLE EYE FOR COOPERATION AND MEETING BASIC NEEDS. THIS PAPER ILLUSTRATES THESE BIASES WITH BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS EXTRACTED FROM THE ISI WEB OF SCIENCE. THERE IS A STARK MISMATCH BETWEEN THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE SUPPLY OF IT. THIS MISMATCH IS IDENTIFIED HERE AS A PROBLEM THAT WE WATER SCIENTISTS MUST CONFRONT AND RESOLVE. WE STILL LACK A FULL UNDERSTANDING WHY THIS DIVERGENCE BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY OCCURS AND PERSISTS; AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IS REQUIRED TO GUIDE US TOWARDS ALIGNING OUR RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO SOCIETAL DEMANDS. THE PAPER, HOWEVER, MAKES SOME INFERENCES. ON THE ONE HAND, WE SHOULD PROMOTE THE GLOBAL SOUTH TO CREATE ITS OWN RESEARCH BIASES AND ALLOW IT TO DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS. SIMULTANEOUSLY WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF OUR OWN RESEARCH PRACTICE. ALTHOUGH THIS PAPER ADDRESSES A CRITICAL CHALLENGE IT DOES NOT AIM TO BE EXHAUSTIVE OR DEFINITIVE. WE MERELY IDENTIFY THE PERSISTENCE OF INTRANSIGENT WATER PROBLEMS AS A VALID RESEARCH OBJECT IN ITSELF.
571	IN THIS STUDY, FIRST THE BASIC PRINCIPLES AND APPROACHES OF LEGAL REALISM WILL BE INTRODUCED, AND THEN IT WILL BE COMPARED TO SOME PARTICULAR ISSUES IN ISLAMIC LAW. THE UNCERTAINTY APPROACH ADVOCATED IN LEGAL REALISM CANNOT BE FOUND IN ISLAMIC LAW, THEREFORE, THE ANALYSIS WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES WHERE IS A CONSENSUS (IJMA) AND WHERE CERTAINTY IS FOUND VIA AUTHENTICITY (THUBUT) AND MEANING (DALALAH). BECAUSE IN ISLAMIC LAW, IJMA REFERS TO THE MOST ADVANCED FIXED AND CLARIFIED LEGAL NOTION WHICH IS TRANSFORMED INTO FIRM EVIDENCE AND SEALED THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES. THE SUBJECTS OF CONSENSUS ARE AMONG THE FIXED, UNTOUCHABLE AND BACKBONE TOPICS IN ISLAM. CONTRARY TO THE METHODOLOGICAL, CONCEPTUAL AND PRINCIPLED UNCERTAINTY EXPRESSED IN LEGAL REALISM, IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THERE IS CERTAINTY ON THE SOURCES, CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES IN ISLAMIC LAW. THE FACT THAT LAW PRACTITIONERS OPERATE ON AN UNCERTAIN GROUND MAKES THE RULE OF LAW IMPOSSIBLE AND TURNS UNLAWFULNESS INTO ITS BASIC FORM. MUSLIM LEGAL SCHOLARS DO NOT CONSIDER LEGAL RULES THAT BECOME CLEAR WITH IJTIHAD AS ABSOLUTE LAW. THE POSSIBILITY OF ERROR WILL ALWAYS EXIST FOR A MUJTAHID- DESPITE HE IS BOUND BY HIS OWN IJTIHAD. THE APPROACH THAT IGNORES THE SOURCE OF LAW INEVITABLY BECOMES CONTRADICTORY TO ISLAMIC LAW. BECAUSE THE SCIENCE OF FIQH, WHICH EXPRESSES THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF ISLAMIC LAW, IS ESSENTIALLY BASED ON THE CONCEPTS OF FINDING THE ROOT AND THE DETERMINING THE ROOT. CONTRARY TO LEGAL REALISM, IN ISLAMIC LAW, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE ETHICS AT LEGAL LEVEL, IN OTHER WORDS ETHICS TAKES AN INDISPENSABLE POSITION IN BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ISLAMIC LAW. DESPITE THE APPROACH OF REALISTS THAT JUSTICE IS SUBJECTED TO LAW, ALTHOUGH IT IS SAID THAT JUSTICE IS SUBJECT TO LAW IN MATTERS REACHED THE CONSENSUS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TALK ABOUT THE FIXATION OF JUSTICE AT THE LEVEL OF IJTIHAD. EVEN THOUGH THE CURRENT LAW FORMED BY CASE LAW IS FAIR, THE NEW LAW THAT CAN BE FORMED WITH NEW CASE LAW WILL ALSO BE FAIR. IN THIS STATE, AT THE LEVEL OF CASE LAW, JUSTICE IS GUIDED BY LAW AND AT THE SAME TIME IT GOVERNS THE LAW. WHILE THE LEGAL REALISTS SAY THAT ALL LEGAL RULES EXPRESS POSSIBILITY; THE MUSLIM LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE TAKEN THE BALANCED APPROACH BY EMPHASIZING THAT SOME RULES EXPRESS CERTAINTY AND OTHERS IMPLY PROBABILITY. IN REALISM, CONCEPTS, METHODOLOGY ARE UNIMPORTANT AND WORTHLESS, THE RESULTS ARE WHAT MATTERS. IN ISLAMIC LAW, THE METHOD IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE RESULT OR EVEN MORE THAN THE RESULT. IN ISLAMIC LAW, ARBITRARY SENTIMENTALITY AND PERSONAL TENDENCIES IN THE CLARIFICATION OF LAW ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE IN JUDICIAL PROCESSES. AS SEEN IN THE LEGAL REALISM, FOR ISLAMIC LAW, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DEFEND A CASUISTIC APPROACH OF FOCUSING ON THE EVENT BY IGNORING THE GENERAL RULES OF LAW FOR ANY PERIOD AND THE SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC LAW. TO QUALIFY ANY JUDGMENT TO BE ISLAMIC, THIS JUDGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE AL-KITAB, AL-SUNNAH, AND THE ABSTRACT LEGAL NORMS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE AN ANALYSIS BY IGNORING THE NA.. (THE DIVINE SOURCES OF ISLAM). ALTHOUGH THE PLURALIST APPROACH MAY SEEM POSITIVE IN TERMS OF OFFERING A WEALTH OF ALTERNATIVES AT FIRST GLANCE, IT INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY. EACH LEGAL SYSTEM AND SCHOOL HAVE ITS OWN UNIQUE HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGY. THE LEGAL NORMS PRODUCED BY EACH CIVILIZATION BASIN, THE VALUE CODES OF THAT CIVILIZATION ARE LOADED. A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS FREE FROM THE VALUE CODES OF THE CIVILIZATION IN WHICH IT WAS BORN IS UNTHINKABLE. THE BIGGEST RESISTANCE THAT THE PLURALIST APPROACH WILL ENCOUNTER IS IN THE FIELD OF CULTURAL CONSISTENCY. BECAUSE THE NORM OF LAW CARRIES TRACES FROM DIFFERENT PLANES AND DIMENSIONS OF CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION BEYOND LOGIC AND MORALITY. TAKING NORMS FROM ANOTHER LEGAL SYSTEM MEANS TRANSFERRING VALUES FROM THAT CIVILIZATION BASIN, WHICH CAUSES TO FUNDAMENTAL INCONSISTENCIES AND CONFLICTS IN THE FUNCTIONING OF LAW. WHEN LEGAL PLURALISM IS ANALYSED IN TERMS OF ISLAMIC LAW, IT IS SEEN THAT EVERY RULE, CONCEPT OR PRINCIPLE INCLUDED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO THE TEST OF CONFORMITY WITH THE AL-KITAB, SUNNAH, CONSENSUS AND BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE A NORM THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE RULES INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS RULE CONSTITUTES THE ESSENCE OF THE PLURALIST APPROACH THAT CAN BE MENTIONED IN THE CONTEXT OF ISLAMIC LAW. THEREFORE, A LIMITED AND REGULAR PLURALISM CAN BE MENTIONED IN ORDER TO GET THE SOLUTIONS OF DIFFERENT LEGAL SCHOOLS. ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW, A PLURALIST APPROACH TO INCLUDE THE SOLUTIONS OF OTHER LEGAL SYSTEMS DIRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANY AUDITING PROCESS IS NOT POSSIBLE. NO FORM OF LAW FROM ROMAN LAW, SOCIALIST LAW, OR JEWISH LAW CAN BE DIRECTLY INCORPORATED INTO ISLAMIC LAW. HOWEVER, IF SOME PRACTICES OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CONQUERED REGIONS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISLAMIC LAW, THEY ARE ACCEPTED AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE EXISTING PRACTICES IS RULED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF CUSTOMARY EVIDENCE. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THESE PRACTICES ARE BASED ON ANY OTHER LEGAL SYSTEM. THE IMPORTANT POINT HERE IS TO COMPLY WITH THE AL-KITAB, THE SUNNAH AND THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ISLAM. ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW, THE FACT THAT ANY PRACTICE IS LEGITIMATE AND VALID IN ANOTHER LEGAL SYSTEM IS NOT HELD AN ABSOLUTE AND VALID REASON FOR IT TO BE QUALIFIED AS A VOID (MARDUD). IN TERMS OF ISLAMIC LAW, THE EXPRESSION EXPLAINING THE STATE IS NOT "FORCE" BUT "THE FULFILLMENT OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS AND WORLDLY AFFAIRS." THE ULAMA ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT IT IS OBLIGATORY FOR MUSLIMS TO ESTABLISH A STATE FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF RELIGIOUS ORDERS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS.
572	THE TRADITIONAL AIM OF REPARATIONS IS TO PLACE THE VICTIM BACK IN THE POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HAD THE HARM NOT OCCURRED. ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS HAVE CRITICISED THIS TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO REPARATIONS FOR SERIOUS CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AS FAILING TO ADDRESS SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISPARITIES AND UNEQUAL POWER STRUCTURES. THE RECENT TRANSFORMATIVE REPARATIONS THEORIES GREW OUT OF THE BELIEF THAT IT IS INEFFECTUAL TO PLACE MARGINALISED VICTIMS BACK IN POSITIONS OF MARGINALISATION FOLLOWING SERIOUS HARM. THE DESIRE TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF VICTIMS AS WELL AS THE POWER STRUCTURES THAT SUSTAIN UNEQUAL RELATIONSHIPS IS COMPELLING. AS A RESULT, THIS IDEA HAS BEEN INFLUENTIAL WITHIN ACADEMIC AND POLICY-MAKING CIRCLES, AND ENDORSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS, THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, AND REGIONAL AND DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS. DESPITE THIS, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHAT 'TRANSFORMATION' MEANS IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO CRITICALLY EXAMINE TRANSFORMATIVE REPARATIONS AND EXPLORE WHETHER THE NOTION IS IN FACT CHANGING THE GAME OR RATHER MORE OF THE SAME. IT QUESTIONS THE UTILITY OF THE LABEL 'TRANSFORMATIVE' AND ITS SUITABILITY IN SPECIFIC CONTEXTS. IT CONCLUDES THAT OUTSIDE THE INTERNATIONAL(ISED) CRIMINAL CONTEXT, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE NATIONAL AND LOCAL CONTEXT, THERE MAY BE GREATER SCOPE FOR REPARATIONS WITH TRANSFORMATIVE POTENTIAL, BUT ONLY WHEN VICTIMS AND AFFECTED COMMUNITIES PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE DECISION-MAKING, AND WHEN LINKED WITH OTHER NON-TEMPORARY, STRUCTURAL CHANGES. EVEN UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, REPARATION AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS OF RAISING FALSE EXPECTATIONS THAT REPARATIONS WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE.
573	THE HISTORY OF MOST COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDED AS RELATIVELY CULTURALLY HOMOGENEOUS, HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PRACTICALLY ALL OF THEM ARE COMPOSED OF MINORITY GROUPS AND THAT MANY OF THESE GROUPS STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL. "CULTURAL" GROUPS, SUCH AS AGE, INTEREST, SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND GENDER GROUPS, PROVIDE THEIR OWN QUOTA QFPROBLEMS FOR EDUCATIONAL PLANNERS, BUT ARE NOT AS POLITICALLY ENCUMBERED AS OTHERS, SUCH AS ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS. IN A SOCIAL DEMOCRACY AS IN SOUTH AFRICA WHERE THE RULE OF LAW REIGNS SUPREME, THE INTEREST AND ATTIRE EXISTENCE OF MINORITY GROUPS ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED BY THE MAJORITY. IN SOME CASES, THEIR CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS ARE SYMBOLICALLY ENTRENCHED IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT THESE MEASURES ARE OFTEN NULLIFIED, FOR INSTANCE THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISIONS. SUCH ACTIONS ON THE PART OFTHE POWERS THAT BE EXPLAIN WHY MINORITY GROUPS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ELSEWHERE ARE DISPLEASED WITH THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ARE BEING HAMPERED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THEIR UNIQUE IDENTITIES. TENSIONS OF THIS NATURE ARE CLEARLY OBSERVABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND ELSEWHERE. THE RECENT REFERENDUM IN SCOTLAND, THE TENSIONS IN CATALONIA AND THE TREATMENT OF THE DALAI LAMA, THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF TIBET, AT THE HANDS OF SOUTH AFRICAN AUTHORITIES ATTEST TO THE TOPICALITY OF THE PROBLEM. ON THE ONE HAND, WE HAVE THE VARIOUS MINORITY GROUPS WITH A NUMBER OF LEGITIMATE CLAIMS, AMONG OTHERS FOR A MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND SELF: ASSERTION, GROUNDED IN A UNIQUE INTERPRETATION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND IN AN APPEAL TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY FORM PART OF A LARGER COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN WHICH EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION REIGN AS SUPREME NATIONAL VALUES. THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY, ALSO APPEALS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, AS EMBODIED IN THE CONSTITUTION. THE END RESULT IS A CONFLICT OF OPINIONS AND IDEALS, EACH BASED ON AN INTERPRETATION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. THE ONUS TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THE TENSION LIES WITH THE VARIOUS MINORITY GROUPS, AND NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MAJORITY. IN FILET, MANY GOVERNMENTS FIND THE CONSTANT COMPLAINTS OFMINORITY GROUPS RATHER IRRITATING. THE IRRITATION IS INTENSIFIED WHERE A. MINORITY GROUP IS ABLE TO PROVIDE IN ITS OWN NEEDS, AND HENCE CAN REFUSE TO ALIGN ITSELF WITH THE GENERAL VALUE SYSTEM OF THE MAJORITY COMMUNITY. THE QUESTION THEREFIRRE ARISES: WHAT CAN MINORITY COMMUNITIES DO IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES? HOW CAN THEY TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS, NEEDS AND FUTURE EXISTENCE? THE FACT THAT MINORITY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED IN INTERNATIONAL TREATISES SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS (1966) OF THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CHARTER OF PARIS FOR A NEW EUROPE (1990) DOES NOT REALLY HELP BECAUSE THEIR,STIPULATIONS ARE REGULARLY FLOUTED BY MAJORITIES. A MINORITY GROUP IS DESCRIBED IN THESE DOCUMENTS AS A NUMERICAL MINORITY WHICH AIMS AT PRESERVING AND DEVELOPING ITS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS IN ITS COUNTRY THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES CAN BE SUMMARISED AS "RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES" WHICH LEADS TO "TREATING EQUALS EQUALLY AND UNEQUALS UNEQUALLY". THE EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS OF MINORITIES ARE LIKEWISE ENTRENCHED IN TWO DOCUMENTS, NAMELY THE CONVENTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION (1960) OF UNESCO, AND THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD (1990). THESE DOCUMENTS STIPULATE THAT MINORITIES ARE ENTITLED TO EDUCATION EQUIVALENT TO THAT OFMAJORITY GROUPS, THAT THE ERECTION OF SEPARATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT BE REGARDED AS DISCRIMINATORY, AND THAT PARENTS / GUARDIANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST FIR THEIR CHILDREN. THE SAME RIGHTS ARE ENTRENCHED IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION. AS STATED ABOVE, MINORITIES HAVE TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROTECTING THEIR OWN RIGHTS. THE CENTRAL CLAIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT A RECENT EPISTEMOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, NAMELY POST-POST- FOUNDATIONALISM, CAN ASSIST THEM IN THIS REGARD. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF FUNDATIONALISM IN THE FORM OF RATIONALISM AND OF THE POST-FOUNDATIONALISM THAT HAS RISEN IN RESPONSE TO FOUNDATIONALISM, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT NEITHER OF THESE ORIENTATIONS PROVIDES A SUITABLE VANTAGE POINT FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORITY RIGHTS. A FOUNDATIONALIST ORIENTATION SEEMS TO BE TOO IMPERIALISTIC AND DETERMINISTIC TO BE OF ANY VALUE TO A MINORITY GROUP AND ALSO TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF WHICH A MINORITY GROUP FARMS PART. SUCH A GROUP TENDS TO CONTROL AND DOMINATE BECAUSE IT SUPPOSES ITSELF TO BE THE VOICE OF REASON. THE POST-FOUNDATIONALISTIC ORIENTATION, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS SHOT THROUGH WITH INDETERMINISTIC VIEWS AND IS RELATIVISTIC AS FAR AS ITS VIEW OF VALUES IS CONCERNED. IT IS ALSO INCONSISTENT IN THAT IT AVOIDS ANY UNIVERSALISTIC STATEMENTS, EXCEPT ITS OWN CLAIM THAT ALL VALUES ARE RELATIVE. BECAUSE NEITHER OF THESE ORIENTATIONS CAN SUCCESSFULLY SERVE AS A BASIS FOR A MINORITY GROUP TO WORK TOWARDS THE RECOGNITION AND ACTUALISATION OF ITS VALUES AND ASPIRATIONS, A THIRD WAY HAD TO BE FOUND. SUCH A THIRD WAY HAS SURFACED SINCE THE 1990S IN THE FORM OF POST-POST-FOUNDATIONALISM, I.E. AN ORIENTATION THAT FBLLOWS AFTER POST-LBUNDATIONALISM. THE KEY FEATURE OF POST-POSTIOUNDATIONALISM IS THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO STEER THROUGH BETWEEN THE EXTREMES OF FOUNDATIONALISM AND POST-FOUNDATIONALISM. THE LATTER TENDS TO OVERLOOK THE NEED FOR A MINORITY GROUP TO OCCASIONALLY MAKE JUSTIFIABLE AND FIRM UNIVERSALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMS (WHICH MAY BE REFUTED, OF COURSE). POST-POST-FIMNDATIONALISM DOES NOT REGARD FOUNDATION AS ABSOLUTELY, REASONABLY FINALLY AND UNIVERSALLY TRUE. WHILE IT REJECTS THE NOTION OF WORKING WITH GRAND NARRATIVES, IT IS PREPARED TO RECOGNISE THE NEED TO RESORT TO FIRM VALUES, WHICH IT ASSUMES CAN ALSO CHANGE WITH TIME, AS LIFE-CONCEPTS TEND TO DO. PUT DIFFERENTLY, FOUNDATIONS ARE NOT SO MUCH IN THE FOREGROUND AS PLAYING A ROLE IN THE BACK OF/HE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. SINCE POST-POST-FOUNDATIONALISM IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH, IT ENABLES MINORITY GROUP STRATEGIC PLANNERS TO FIND A WAY FOR A MINORITY GROUP TO REMAIN TRUE TO ITS VALUE FOUNDATION WHILE REMAINING FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE IN ORDER TAFIND A NICHE FOR ITSELF IN THE BROADER COMMUNITY OF WHICH THE GROUP IS APART. IN DOING SO, A MINORITY GROUP CAN REMAIN TRUE TO ITS OWN IDEALS AND ASPIRATIONS AND ALSO BECOME AND REMAIN A VALUABLE PART OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY.
574	WHAT ROLE DOES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAY IN TRANSITIONING TOWARD A MORE JUST SOCIETY? THE TWO LITERATURES BEST EQUIPPED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION- TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION-HAVE NEGLECTED BOTH THE QUESTION AND ONE ANOTHER. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED ON A LIMITED SET OF MEASURES (SUCH AS TRUTH COMMISSIONS AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS) AND OVERLOOKED THE ROLE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN FACILITATING TRANSITION. AT THE SAME TIME, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SCHOLARS HAVE NEGLECTED THE WAYS IN WHICH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MAY BE PART OF A LARGER TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROJECT. BRINGING THESE LITERATURES INTO CONVERSATION FOR THE FIRST TIME, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW INTEGRATING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CAN ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH PRACTICES. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CAN BRING ATTENTION TO STRUCTURAL INEQUALITIES IN TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES AND HELP DELINEATE THE BOUNDARIES OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. IN SO DOING, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CAN BRIDGE A DIVIDE BETWEEN THE FIELD OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND THE PHENOMENON OF SOCIETAL TRANSITION THAT IT SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND AND FACILITATE. TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN ELUCIDATE HOW THE PERIOD OF TRANSITION INFORMS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION'S FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS; IT CAN ALSO ILLUMINATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION'S STRENGTHS AND SHORTCOMINGS IN BRINGING ABOUT A MORE JUST SOCIETY. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SHOULD, THEREFORE, BE ADDED TO THE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE "TOOLKIT" AND ANCHORED IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CONCEPTS AND DEBATES.
575	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON EVIDENCE FROM LOOSELY STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND DATA FROM ORIGINAL SURVEYS OF 5,130 DELEGATES IN TOWNSHIP, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL CONGRESSES TO ARGUE THAT CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION UNFOLDS AS AUTHORITARIAN PAROCHIALISM IN CHINA. IT MAKES THREE NEW ARGUMENTS. FIRST, POPULARLY ELECTED LOCAL CONGRESSES THAT ONCE ONLY MECHANICALLY STOOD IN FOR THE CHINESE MASS PUBLIC, THROUGH DEMOGRAPHICALLY DESCRIPTIVE AND POLITICALLY SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION, NOW WORK AS SUBSTANTIVELY REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS. CHINESE LOCAL CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN VIEW THEMSELVES AND ACT AS "DELEGATES," NOT BURKEAN TRUSTEES OR LENINIST PARTY AGENTS. SECOND, THIS CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION IS NOT COMMONLY EXPRESSED IN THE QUINTESSENTIALLY LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES FAMILIAR IN OTHER REGIME TYPES. RATHER, IT IS AN EXTRA-LEGISLATIVE VARIANT OF PORK-BARREL POLITICS: PAROCHIAL ACTIVITY BY DELEGATES TO DELIVER TARGETED PUBLIC GOODS TO THE GEOGRAPHIC CONSTITUENCY. THIRD, THIS AUTHORITARIAN PAROCHIALISM IS DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND REGIME PRIORITIES, SOME COMMON TO SINGLE-PARTY DICTATORSHIPS AND SOME DISTINCT TO CHINESE AUTHORITARIANISM.
576	NINE OUT OF 10 CONSTITUTIONS CONTAIN EXPLICIT EMERGENCY PROVISIONS, INTENDED TO HELP GOVERNMENTS COPE WITH EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS THAT ENDANGER MANY PEOPLE OR THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE. WE ASK TWO QUESTIONS: (1) DOES THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF EMERGENCY PROVISIONS HELP GOVERNMENTS TO COPE WITH DISASTERS AND OTHER EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS? (2) WHAT PARTICULAR PARTS OF EMERGENCY CONSTITUTIONS FARE BEST? WE FIND THAT THE MORE ADVANTAGES EMERGENCY CONSTITUTIONS CONFER TO THE EXECUTIVE, THE HIGHER THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE KILLED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A NATURAL DISASTER, CONTROLLING FOR ITS SEVERITY. AS THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED RESULT, WE DISCUSS A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS, THE MOST PLAUSIBLE BEING THAT GOVERNMENTS USE NATURAL DISASTERS AS A PRETEXT TO ENHANCE THEIR POWER. FURTHERMORE, THE EASIER IT IS TO CALL A STATE OF EMERGENCY, THE LARGER THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. INTERESTINGLY, PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRACIES ARE BETTER ABLE TO COPE WITH NATURAL DISASTERS THAN PARLIAMENTARY ONES IN TERMS OF LIVES SAVED, WHEREAS AUTOCRACIES DO SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE IN THE SENSE THAT EMPOWERMENT RIGHTS SERIOUSLY SUFFER IN THE AFTERMATH OF A DISASTER.
577	THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE LITERATURE ON FIELD RESEARCH REGARDING ISSUES OF RESEARCH DESIGN, METHODOLOGY, AND DATA EVALUATION. YET, THE PRACTICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL INTRICACIES THAT PRECEDE SUCCESSFUL FIELDWORK ARE FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED. THIS LACK OF METHODICAL ADVICE MAY BE DUE TO THE IMPRESSION THAT FIELD RESEARCH IS HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL, AND SO CASE-SPECIFIC THAT GENERAL GUIDELINES, WHICH APPLY TO ALL FIELD RESEARCH ENDEAVOURS ALIKE, ARE INCONCEIVABLE. WHILE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ORGANISATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF FIELD RESEARCH, WE DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT THE PREPARATORY DIMENSION OF FIELDWORK IS BY NECESSITY UNIQUE FOR EVERY UNDERTAKING. RATHER, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMMON CHALLENGES THAT OCCUR DURING THE PREPARATION AND ORGANISATION PHASE OF A FIELD TRIP CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND FORMULATED. CONSEQUENTLY, WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS TEN ORGANISATIONAL 'DO'S' PRECEDING SUCCESSFUL FIELD RESEARCH. CURRENT GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FUTURE FIELD RESEARCHERS WILL REGARD THESE TEN POINTERS AS USEFUL HINTS IN THE ORGANISATION OF THEIR OWN ENDEAVOUR. WHILE THE LIST IS BY NO MEANS EXHAUSTIVE, THE TEN RECOMMENDATIONS WILL LOWER THE ORGANISATIONAL ENTRY COSTS OF ASPIRING FIELD RESEARCHERS, AND ENABLE THEM TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING UPON ARRIVAL IN THE FIELD.
578	THE ANTHROPOCENE AS A NEW EPOCH BRINGS INTO QUESTION THE TRADITIONAL MODES OF CONCEPTUALISING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT IT DOES THIS BY FORCING STUDENTS AND PRACTITIONERS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS TO THINK THROUGH HOW THE DISCIPLINE WORKS AS A SET OF IDEAS AND PRACTICES, IN FACT, AS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF PROBLEMS AND POLICYMAKING PER SE. AS A DISCIPLINE, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THE QUESTIONING OF THE PROBLEMATICS OF HUMAN EXCEPTIONALISM, RATIONALIST PROBLEM-SOLVING AND LIBERAL MODERNIST IMAGINARIES OF PROGRESS, WHICH HAVE SHAPED THE AGENDAS OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE, DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY. BEYOND THE DARK DAYS OF THE COLD WAR, WHEN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WAS ESSENTIALLY A STRATEGIC EXERCISE OF REALPOLITIK, THE DISCIPLINE HAS STAKED A LOT ON THE BASIS THAT ENLIGHTENMENT LIBERALISM IS THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA TO HUMAN ILLS AND THAT IRRATIONAL STRUCTURES OR AGENCIES CAN BE CIVILISED OR TAMED TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF HUMANITY, BOTH IN NATIONAL OR GLOBAL REGIMES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. THESE DREAMS OF LIBERAL UNIVERSAL SOLUTIONS APPEAR TO HAVE RUN AGROUND IN THE ANTHROPOCENE AS THE LAST DECADE HAS MARKED A SHIFT AWAY FROM UNIVERSAL, MODERNIST OR 'LINEAR' UNDERSTANDINGS OF POWER AND AGENCY. IN A WORLD, CONSTRUED AS MORE COMPLEX, CONTINGENT AND RELATIONAL AND REPLETE WITH CRISES AND UNPREDICTED 'TIPPING POINTS', TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE UP-ENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SEEM MORE RELEVANT THAN 'GOOD INTENTIONS'.CONCOMITANTLY, THE METHODOLOGICAL FOCUS HAS SWITCHED AWAY FROM UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF ENTITIES AND TOWARDS PRIVILEGING THE ANALYSIS OF RELATIONS, NETWORKS AND CONTEXTS. KEY TO THIS HAS BEEN DEBATES FOCUSED AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING WHICH EXPLICITLY CAST POLICY PROBLEMS NOT AS EXTERNAL THREATS TO THE 'GOOD LIFE' (THAT REQUIRES SECURING) BUT AS INSTEAD QUESTIONING THE STARTING ASSUMPTIONS OF SEPARATIONS BETWEEN INSIDE/ OUTSIDE, HUMANITY/ NATURE, SOLUTIONS/ PROBLEMS AND REFERENTS/ THREATS. THIS ELICITS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING. IF NATURAL PROCESSES CAN NO LONGER BE SEPARATED FROM THE HISTORICAL IMPACT OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND ARE NO LONGER MERELY THE BACKDROP TO A PURELY HUMAN DRAMA OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL CONTESTATION, THEN THE MODERNIST UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE/ CULTURE DIVIDE, SEPARATING SOCIAL AND NATURAL SCIENCE, NO LONGER HOLDS. NATURE CAN NO LONGER BE UNDERSTOOD AS OPERATING ON FIXED OR NATURAL LAWS, WHILE POLITICS AND CULTURE CAN NO LONGER BE UNDERSTOOD AS OPERATING IN A SEPARATE SPHERE OF AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS, CENTRAL TO MODERNIST CONSTRUCTIONS OF PROGRESS, ARE SEEN TO NO LONGER EXIST OR TO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMATIC. THUS, THE ANTHROPOCENE IS NOT MERELY A QUESTION OF NEW OR MORE PRESSING PROBLEMS, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, BUT ALSO A MATTER OF THE TOOLS AND UNDERSTANDINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US: IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS A MATTER OF HOW WE KNOW -OF EPISTEMOLOGY- AND ALSO OF WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD TO CONSIST OF -I.E. QUESTIONS OF ONTOLOGY. CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CONVENTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF SECURITY AS THE PROTECTION OF A VALUED REFERENT AGAINST EXTERNAL THREATS. THE CONDITION OF THE ANTHROPOCENE CHALLENGES SUCH A NOTION OF SECURITY. THE ANTHROPOCENE AS A CONDITION, PROBLEMATISES EASY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 'US' AS THE SECURITY 'REFERENT' -AS THE OBJECT TO BE SECURED.THE PROBLEMATISATION OF 'US' -THE PRIVILEGED GAZE OF THE WESTERN POLICYMAKING SUBJECT- OPENS UP A SUBSTANTIAL SET OF PROBLEMS WHICH DEEPLY IMPACT THE DISCIPLINARY ASSUMPTIONS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. THIS IS EXPRESSED, FOR EXAMPLE, IN BRUNO LATOUR'S CONCEPT OF EARTHBOUND PEOPLE, I.E., AN IMAGINARY COLLECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES SENSITIVE AND RESPONSIVE, DUE TO BEING BOUND BY AND TO THE EARTH. WE ARE THE PROBLEM AS MUCH AS THE SOLUTION, THE 'THEM' AS MUCH AS THE 'US', THE 'ENEMY' AS MUCH AS THE 'FRIEND'. ACCORDINGLY, THE ANTHROPOCENE CONDITION CALLS FOR REFLECTION UPON -AND ULTIMATELY TRANSITION AWAY FROM- THE IDEA OF A SEPARATION BETWEEN NATURE AND HUMANITY. TO PERFORM THIS SHIFT IN PERSPECTIVE, CONCEPTS SUCH AS "WORLDLY" OR "ECOLOGICAL SECURITY" HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. MATT MCDONALD DEVELOPS A NOTION "ECOLOGICAL SECURITY" THROUGH AN ENGAGEMENT WITH EXISTING DISCOURSES OF CLIMATE SECURITY. ACCORDING TO HIM, ESTABLISHED WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT CLIMATE SECURITY WOULD REINFORCE A PROBLEMATIC NATURE-CULTURE DIVIDE BY EITHER PRESENTING CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN EXTERNAL THREAT TO VULNERABLE HUMAN COMMUNITIES OR, CONVERSELY, HUMAN ACTORS AS A THREAT TO FRAGILE NATURE IN NEED OF PROTECTION. ECOLOGICAL SECURITY WOULD INSTEAD FOCUS ON SUPPORTING AND SUSTAINING THE LONG-TERM RESILIENCE OF ECOSYSTEMS -UNDERSTOOD AS ENTANGLED SYSTEMS OF BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ELEMENTS. ENSURING THAT "ECOSYSTEMS CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION IN THE FACE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGE" IS ACCORDINGLY, THE ONLY DEFENSIBLE APPROACH TO SECURITY IN THE CONDITION OF THE ANTHROPOCENE. SIMILARLY, A WORLDLY APPROACH TO SECURITY STRESSES THAT THREATS SUCH AS WAR, MAJOR INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS, OR ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSE DO NOT AFFECT HUMANS IN ISOLATION BUT RATHER ENDANGER THE COMMON WORLDS CO-CONSTITUTED BY HUMANS AND DIVERSE NONHUMAN BEINGS. HARRINGTON AND SHEARING HOLD THAT SECURITY IN THE ANTHROPOCENE SHOULD BECOME ORIENTED TOWARDS AN "ETHICS OF CARE". CARE, ACCORDING TO THEM, IS ABLE TO EMPHASIZE THE TYPES OF DEEP RELATIONAL THINKING THAT ARE SO APPROPRIATE WHEN DISCUSSING THE EARTH'S ONGOING AND UNKNOWN PATTERNS OF INTERACTIONS AND RESPONSES. IT ALLOWS ONE TO SEE SECURITY AS A RADICAL ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN HUMANS, NON-HUMAN ANIMALS, PLANTS, BACTERIA, MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY. LEARNING HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS ENTANGLEMENT WITH CARE WILL BE A PRIMARY TASK FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN OUR ANTHROPOCENE WORLD. THIS ARTICLE IS ORGANISED IN THREE SECTIONS. FIRSTLY, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF THE ANTHROPOCENE. WE REFER TO THE ANTHROPOCENE AS A CONDITION THAT WE ARE IN RATHER THAN AS AN EXTERNAL SET OF PROBLEMS WHICH WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH. UNDERSTOOD AS A CONDITION WHICH WE ARE IN, RATHER THAN MERELY A SET OF STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL PROBLEMS WHICH WE CONFRONT, THE ANTHROPOCENE ENABLES US TO GO BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL BINARIES OF OUR DISCIPLINARY TRADITION. THE SECOND SECTION PROVIDES SOME BACKGROUND TO THE DISCIPLINARY HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, HERE WE SEEK TO BRIEFLY FLAG UP THE IMPORTANCE OF THINKING THE ANTHROPOCENE IN RELATION TO THE HISTORY OF THE DISCIPLINE, WHICH COULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS MOVING FROM AN 'INTERNATIONAL' OR STATE-CENTRED FOCUS DURING THE COLD WAR TO A GLOBAL SET OF MUCH BROADER CONCERNS FROM THE 1980S TO THE 2000S, TO AN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE ANTHROPOCENE, UNDERSTOOD AS A 'PLANETARY' CHALLENGE TO THE LIBERAL UNIVERSAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT FOLLOWED THE DECLINE OF 'REALIST' HEGEMONY.THE THIRD SECTION FOCUSES ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ANTHROPOCENE FOR THREE KEY THEMES: KNOWLEDGE, GOVERNANCE AND SECURITY.
579	THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY USED IN THE STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS WHICH, THANKS TO ITS VERSATILITY AND UTILITY, HAS GENERATED AN EXPANSION OF ITS CONCEPTUAL, METHODOLOGICAL, AND PRACTICAL SCOPE. REGIONAL GOVERNANCE IS A USEFUL DERIVATION BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND, FROM A MORE PRECISE PERSPECTIVE, HOW GLOBAL ISSUES WITH LOCAL REPERCUSSIONS ARE SOLVED. IN THIS SENSE, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT SECURITY GOVERNANCE IN LATIN AMERICA IS CHARACTERIZED BY ENDURING BALANCE OF POWER PRACTICES, GEOPOLITICS, AND MISTRUST BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARTIES. AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS COEXISTENCE BETWEEN THE HISTORICAL INTENTION TO ESTABLISH SECURITY COMMUNITIES, TO FIND RESOLUTIONS TO CONTROVERSIES, AND TO SOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL INSTRUMENTS, PRINCIPLES, AND VALUES THAT FAVOR PEACEFUL MEANS. IN OTHER WORDS,IN THE REGION WE ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF A HYBRID SECURITY GOVERNANCE, WITH PRACTICES THAT EVOLVE OVER TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THREE KEY FACTORS: THE BEHAVIOR OF STATES AND OTHER AGENTS,THE CAPACITY OF INSTITUTIONS TO OVERCOME STRUCTURAL AND CONJUNCTURAL CHALLENGES,AND FINALLY,THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN PERCEPTIONS OF ORGANIZED CRIME AND OTHER IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL CHALLENGES. THEREFORE, THIS ARTICLE CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS. IN THE FIRST, THE DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE WILL BE REVIEWED. SUBSEQUENTLY, ITS UTILITY WILL BE VALIDATED FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF REGIONAL ORDERS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE FORGED THERE. FINALLY, IT WILL BE USED TO EXPOSE THE HYBRID CHARACTERISTICS IN LATINAMERICA THROUGHOUT THE 21ST CENTURY. TRADITIONALLY, SINCE ITS INCEPTION AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE, THE EXPLANATIONS PROVIDED BY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MULTIFACETED DEBATES. IN FACT, IT WAS THROUGH THESE GREAT DEBATES, SOMETIMES THEORETICAL AND IN OTHER CASES METHODOLOGICAL, THAT THE DISCIPLINE GREW IN TERMS OF ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS IN THE POLITICAL SCOPE FOR DECISION-MAKING.THIS LED TO THE CREATION OF A TRUE FIELD OF STUDY, WHICH TOOK AS ITS INITIAL OBJECT OF STUDY THE AREA OF WAR AND PEACE BETWEEN NATIONS, BEFORE LATER MOVING ON TO COOPERATION, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER ISSUES OF THE CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL AGENDA. LIKEWISE, GOVERNANCE HAS BEEN AN IDEAL VEHICLE TO GIVE GREATER SCOPE AND HETEROGENEITY TO EXPLANATIONS OF PROCESSES AND EMPIRICAL EVENTS, ONES WHICH GO BEYOND TRADITIONAL THEORETICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS REALISM, INSTITUTIONAL LIBERALISM OR CONSTRUCTIVISM. ALONG THE SAME LINES,THIS PROGRESSIVE ACADEMIC PRODUCTION HAS STIMULATED THE SPECIALIZATION AND CONCENTRATION OF GOVERNANCE IN REGIONAL ORDERS, SINCE IT ALLOWS A CLEARER REFLECTION ON THE HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR AMONG THE MEMBERS. THIS OFFERS A MORE NUANCED EXPLANATION OF THE CHALLENGES PRESENT, THE RESPONSES REQUIRED FOR STRUCTURAL OR CONJUNCTURAL ISSUES, AND THE EVENTUAL EMERGENCE OF DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS. SECURITY GOVERNANCE HAS MAINLY FOCUSED ON FOUR CHALLENGES TO SOLVE. FIRST, THE EXPANSION OF THE RESEARCH AGENDA TO SPECIFIC CONTEXTS; SECOND, THE GREATER ATTENTION THAT ACADEMIC PRODUCTION SHOULD GIVE TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER NON-STATE ACTORS IN DEFINED SPACES; THIRD, THE PREDOMINANCE OF EXPLANATIONS ON SECURITY IN THE EUROATLANTIC REGION AND, FINALLY, THE NEED TO FURTHER LINK THE SECURITY GOVERNANCE AGENDA TO DEBATES ON REGION AND REGIONALISM. IN THE SAME WAY, THE CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS DEVELOPED IN THE REGIONS CANNOT BE DETACHED FROM GLOBAL DYNAMICS. IN THIS SENSE,REGARDLESS OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL CHARACTER OF A REGION SUCH AS EUROPE OR SOUTH AMERICA, THESE ARE MAINLY POLITICAL FACTORS, AS HURRELL WELL RECOGNIZES, THAT REGIONAL DYNAMICS ARE A HISTORICAL SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION, WHICH HAS BEEN POLITICALLY CONTESTED AND CRITICIZED. WITH THE INTENTION OF RECOGNIZING PATTERNS OF CONTINUITY AND TRANSFORMATION, WHICH FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF DYNAMICS THAT PARTICULARIZE AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM. IN THIS SENSE, LATIN AMERICA HAS NOT NEGLECTED THE USE OF GOVERNANCE, AS A CONCEPT AND AS A VALID ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE MADE UP A PARTICULAR SET OF ELEMENTS THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, ENDURE OVER TIME AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE RECENTLY CHANGED.WHEN REFERRING TO SECURITY, THE OPPOSING POINTS OF VIEW SHOW THE EMERGENCE AND INCIPIENT DEVELOPMENT OF A HETEROGENEOUS,INCOMPLETE, AND CONTROVERSIAL GOVERNANCE. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE, BASED ON A HYBRID AND ECLECTIC APPROACH, WILL BE TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE AND ESTABLISH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SECURITY FOR LATIN AMERICA. THUS, IN MATTERS OF SECURITY GOVERNANCE, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE HYBRID CHARACTER FROM TWO LINES OF ARGUMENT; ON THE ONE HAND, THERE ARE DEFENDERS OF A VISION BASED ON GEOPOLITICS, THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE LATENT TENSION BETWEEN STATES; AND ON THE OTHER, THERE IS ONE MORE ORIENTED TO ANALYZE SECURITY CHARACTERISTICS FROM A CONSTRUCTIVIST, ASSOCIATIVE AND COOPERATIVE PERSPECTIVE. INDEED, ADLER AND GREVE PRESENTED AN INTERESTING INITIAL REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT, IN THE SENSE THAT BOTH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVEMENTS, NOT ALWAYS ASCENDING,THAT STATES CARRY TO EQUIP THEMSELVES WITH INSTRUMENTS AND MECHANISMS THAT ENABLE THEM. THEY ALLOW YOU TO LIVE TOGETHER IN A MORE HARMONIOUS AND PEACEFUL WAY. FIRST,SOME AUTHORS SITUATE REGIONAL GOVERNANCE IN MAINLY REALISTIC TERMS, IN WHICH THE DYNAMICS OF BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN STATES CONTINUE TO PREVAIL TWO HUNDRED YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE. THEY UNDERLINE, FOR EXAMPLE, REALITIES OF UNGOVERNABILITY, WHILE A SERIES OF SPECIFIC VARIABLES, AMONG WHICH AT LEAST FIVE STAND OUT: FIRST, THE OLD GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BETWEEN STATES CONTINUE TO DETERMINE SITUATIONS OF CONFLICT AND MISTRUST; SECONDLY, THE COMPETENCIES OF INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL LEADERS IN PROVISION OF COMMON GOODS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION STAND OUT. THIRD, REGIONAL DISPUTES HAVE CONTINUED TO BE FUELED BOTH BY INTERNAL COMPETITION - THAT IS, BETWEEN THE STATES OF THE REGION - AND, AT THE SAME TIME, BY PERMISSIVENESS IN THE FACE OF THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL POWERS; FOURTH, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY FOR THE COUNTRIES OF THE REGION, WHICH FACILITATES INTERNAL GOVERNANCE PROCESSES AND STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW AND, FINALLY, THE LINK BETWEEN SECURITY AND THE ECONOMY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THAT IS, THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE AND ECONOMIC AUTONOMY IN STRENGTHENING STATE SECURITY. SECOND, THERE IS THE MOST INTERPRETIVE LINE OF REFLECTION ON REALITY, HIGHLIGHTING THAT BEYOND THE INSTRUMENTS OF POWER AND GEOPOLITICAL, POLITICAL PROCESSES AND NEW IDEOLOGICAL REALIGNMENTS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD, IN WHICH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES CAN BE HIGHLIGHTED: FIRST, THE INTERNAL FACTORS THAT CONDITION OR REINFORCE THE INTERNATIONAL ACTION OF THE STATES; SECOND, THE REGIONAL REDEFINITION BASED ON THE CREATION OF ALTERNATIVE MULTILATERAL FORUMS, BEYOND THE OAS, SUCH AS CELAC, UNASUR OR ALBA, IN WHICH THERE ARE ALSO COMPONENTS NOT ONLY OF TRADE AND INTEGRATION, BUT ALSO OF SECURITY AND, FINALLY, THE LITTLE REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SECURITY WITH LOW INSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY DENSITY.
580	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS AND THE LEGAL STATUS OF SUBJECTS OF LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE IN UKRAINE. CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP AS INDEED, ANY OTHER RELATIONSHIP WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY THE LAW ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX, DIVERSE AND MULTI-FACETED, MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AND THEY ARE MARKED GRADATION. THESE FEATURES REQUIRE THE STATE TO ESTABLISH LEGAL MECHANISMS, PROCEDURES FOR THE USE OF RIGHTS, DUTIES, ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY. TO THIS END, THE STATE CREATES PROCEDURAL RULES DESIGNED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL AND EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW. CENTRAL AMONG ALL KINDS OF LEGAL PROCESS WITHOUT A DOUBT TAKES THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS (FROM LAT. PROCESSUS - CHEATS, PROMOTION, FORWARD) - IT IS AN ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROCEDURE OF ITS STAKEHOLDERS ON THE CREATION, INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND OTHER LEGAL PROVISIONS AIMED AT IMPLEMENTING THE SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THE COURSE OF THESE SUBJECTS THEIR DUTIES AND POWERS OF IMPLEMENTATION, SOME OF THEM OF THEIR RIGHTS AND LEGITIMATE INTERESTS. THE ESSENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, IT IS MANIFESTED IN SUCH TERMS: DUE TO THE SIMULTANEOUS OCCURRENCE AND HARMONIZATION OF PROCEDURAL RULES WITH SUBSTANTIVE NORMS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH THESE PROCEDURAL RULES PROVIDE; REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LEGAL NORMS OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW; IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE NORMS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, IMPLEMENTED IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THEM; CONTAINS A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF ESTABLISHING A PROCEDURAL REMEDIAL ORDER, WHICH PROVIDES THE DESIRED OPTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AND IN WHICH, HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES, EACH LEGAL ENTITY IS ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY AND AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION, BUT WITHIN THE LAW, TO ELECT ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVE WAYS SUCH IMPLEMENTATION; BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, PRIORITY RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS; HAS A SYSTEMIC NATURE, WHICH PROVIDES AN EFFICIENT AND OPTIMAL ORGANIZATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL REGULATION, ITS SEQUENCE AND TIMING. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES FORMING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, SHOULD DETERMINE THE LATTER PURPOSE, THE TYPE OF REGULATED RELATIONS, THE PERSONS WHO ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS, THE ACTIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THEM, THE TIMING AND SEQUENCING OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE ACTIONS, AS WELL AS LEGAL MEANS, THAT ENSURE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE PROCESS. REVEALING THE CONTENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, IT IS ALSO ADVISABLE TO DETERMINE THE PLACE OF PROCEDURAL RULES IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF SOCIETY. SETTLEMENT OF LEGAL ACTIVITY PROCEDURAL RULES, ITS QUALITY DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE OF APPROPRIATE SOCIAL RELATIONS TO SOCIETY, THEIR COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY, THE IMPERATIVE OR DISPOSITIVE LEGAL NORMS REGULATING MATERIAL, A NUMBER OF OTHER OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTORS. AS CONSTITUTIONAL LAW REGULATES THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR SOCIETY SOCIAL RELATIONS THAT ARE CELEBRATED COMPLICATED POLITICAL AND LEGAL NATURE AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURAL CONSTRUCTION, THE IMPERATIVE NATURE OF LEGAL REGULATION, IT IS LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS ITSELF IS DETERMINATIVE FOR THE STATE AND SOCIETY. THE NOTION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN THE SCIENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL LAW IS USUALLY REGARDED IN THE BROAD AND NARROW SENSE. IN THE NARROW SENSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IS TRADITIONALLY UNDERSTOOD AS THE STATUTORY PROCEDURE FOR THE CONSIDERATION AND DECISION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE CASES BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL IDEAS AND APPEALS SUBJECTS CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. ALSO UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IS SOMETIMES UNDERSTOOD AS SEPARATE SUBJECTS PROCEDURE ATTRACTION CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND SOMETIMES EVEN TO BUILD THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN THE DESIGN AND ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS AS THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OF STATE BUILDING, IN OTHER WORDS, IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE. IN A BROAD SENSE AS THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS CONSIDER HOW TO RESOLVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL RULES OF THE ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND THEIR OFFICIALS AND OTHER AUTHORIZED ENTITIES, AIMED AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUBSTANTIVE CONSTITUTIONAL, AS WELL AS SOME OTHER RELATED INDUSTRIES RIGHT IN THE CREATION, INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL NORMS THAT CONSTITUTE THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THESE BRANCHES OF LAW. BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS AS ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CREATION, INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND OTHER LEGAL NORMS AIMED AT ACHIEVING CERTAIN SOCIAL OR LEGAL RESULT, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CLASSIFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS FOR THE TYPES OF LEGAL ACTIVITY ON THE LAWMAKING, LAW AND EXPLANATORY IMPLEMENTS RIGHT. CONSTITUTIONAL-LAW-MAKING PROCESS IS AN ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROCEDURES OF ENTITIES CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF LEGAL ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY, AND THE FORMATION OF APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL DECISIONS AND ACTS. DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF LAW-MAKING AND THE NATURE OF ITS SUBJECTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED LEGISLATIVE, ELECTORAL PROCESS (THE LAST TWO ARE ALSO CONSIDERING AND IMPLEMENTING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE POSITIONS RIGHT, IF WE CONSIDER THE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN THESE PROCESSES PROCEDURE REALIZATION OF THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION). CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE LAW-MAKING PROCESS INVOLVED PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS PEOPLE AS ITS ONLY LEGITIMATE MEDIA. THE SUBJECTS OF THE RIGHT PROCESS CAN BE ANY LEGAL SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, THE SPECIAL FORM OF THE RIGHT - LAW ENFORCEMENT, ONLY AUTHORIZED ENTITIES THAT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO PERFORM ANY ACT AIMED AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ACTIVITY. AND IN ORDER ENFORCEMENT IS CARRIED OUT BASIC FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT - PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RIGHT AS WELL AS THE USE OF STATE COERCION. CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN ITS BROADEST SENSE IS BASED ON SEVERAL PRINCIPLES AS DEFINING, GUIDING IDEAS FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FOR THE MOST PART THESE PRINCIPLES CONSTITUTE THE FOUNDATION PRINCIPLES OF THE INDIVIDUAL STATE BODIES AND THEIR OFFICIALS WHO REPRESENT SO LEGAL SPECIFICS PROCEDURAL FORMS OF THEIR ACTIVITY (FOR EXAMPLE, GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONSTITUTION OR THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, CERTAIN ELECTORAL LAW, AND THE LIKE). IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS ITS MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE IS THE SEQUENCE THAT INDICATES A SEVERE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF PRIORITY ACTIONS, WHICH GOVERNS PERFECTION, OPTIMALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. ON THE CONTRARY, THE LACK OF LEGAL REGULATION OF THIS SEQUENCE, AND THE MORE HER ABSENCE, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE QUALITY OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, ITS DYNAMICS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE OR SIGNIFICANTLY COMPLICATES THE IMPLEMENTATION SUBJECTS CONSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL PROCEDURAL RULES, FINDS EXPRESSION IN THE STAGES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS.
581	THE CHALLENGES FACING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CAN SOMETIMES CREATE TENSIONS, IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION MUST ANSWER BOTH TO THE PROTECTION AND GUARANTEE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS, AND TO GLOBAL NEEDS THAT EXCEPTIONALLY REQUIRE THE SUSPENSION OF THOSE SAME RIGHTS FOR THE GREATER GOOD. IN ITS LIBERAL POLITICAL TRADITION THAT BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF A PUBLIC AND A PRIVATE SPHERE, IT HAS ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, RULE OF LAW AND STABLE INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF ITS CITIZENS. YET SOMETIMES THESE MUST BE SUSPENDED IN CASES OF EXCEPTIONALITY FOR THEIR OWN PRESERVATION.THIS WAS THE CASE DURING THE 2020 PANDEMIC, WHEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES DECREED QUARANTINES AGAINST THE CONSOLIDATED AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT OF PERSONS, TO RESTRICT CONTACTS AND TRY TO CONTAIN CONTAGIONS. IN THIS CONTEXT, DIGITAL POLICIES WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTED TO DEAL WITH CRISIS MANAGEMENT, LIKE COVID APPLICATIONS FOR TRACING AND MONITORING CONTACTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.THIS INVASION OF THE PRIVATE SPHERE OF CITIZENS HAD TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SET OF LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES, TO PROTECT THIS INHERENT AND PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT.THESE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EUROPEAN LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK (THE COMMONLY KNOWN ACQUIS COMMUNAUTAIRE), WHICH INCLUDED SEVERAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS LAID OUT BY THE EU TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS MEMBER-STATE GOVERNMENTS ON THIS MATTER. APART FROM THE GDPR AND THE EPRIVACY DIRECTIVE, WE UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF RECOMMENDATION (EU) 2020/518 THAT CONNECTS HEALTH RIGHTS, HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND DATA PROTECTION; AND ALSO, THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION 2020/C 124 I/01 THAT SET A SERIES OF IDEAL ELEMENTS TO GUIDE APPS FUNCTIONS, AND ESTABLISHED THE IMPORTANCE THAT IT IS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT MANAGE DIGITAL APPS, SO THERE IS A GUARANTEE OF THE PROTECTION OF CITIZENS' RIGHTS.THROUGH THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HOW APPS WERE MANAGED WHEN THEY FIRST APPEARED IN 2020 THROUGHOUT MOST OF 2021, AND HOW APPS EVOLVED (BOTH IN MANAGEMENT AND USE) IN 2021 AND THROUGHOUT 2022, WE CAN ADDRESS THE EVOLUTION OF EU POLICY ON DIGITAL MATTERS, WHICH HAVE MEANT TO CREATE NEW FRAMEWORKS FOR INTERNET NAVIGATION. AT FIRST, THERE WERE 24 DIFFERENT APPS FOR THE 24 OUT OF 27 MEMBER STATES WHO DECIDED TO CREATE AND PROMOTE THE USE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AMONG THEIR CITIZENS. MOST OF THEM WERE MANAGED BY NATIONAL AUTHORITIES (EXCEPT FOR AUSTRIA AND ROMANIA WHO WERE MANAGED BY RED CROSS AND A LOCAL NGO RESPECTIVELY), AND WERE DEVELOPED BY A PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION, OR ONLY PUBLIC AGENCIES. AT THE END OF THE CRISIS, AT LEAST POLITICALLY SINCE SOCIETAL WEARINESS AND THE ECONOMIC CRISIS RENDERED IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP THE RESTRICTIONS INTRODUCED IN THE SPRING OF 2020, IN JUNE 2021 THE EU CREATED ITS GREENPASS OR VACCINATION PASSPORT. THIS POLICY WAS IMPLEMENTED IN MOST COUNTRIES AND EVEN THOUGH 24 DIFFERENT NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES WERE STILL IN PLACE, THEY ALL USED THE EU PASSPORT, AVAILABLE TO CITIZENS VIA THEIR NATIONAL HEALTH WEBSITES OR APPS.EVEN THOUGH THE EXCEPTIONALITY OF THE PANDEMIC HAS ENDED, ONE OF THE OUTCOMES HAS BEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM OF DATA GATHERING, STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT FOR PUBLIC MEANS, MANAGED BY NATIONAL AUTHORITIES, WHICH HAS TECHNICALLY CREATED A DIGITAL CONTRACT WHERE THE STATE GUARANTEES CITIZENS' DIGITAL RIGHTS. THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS WE ATTEND TO AN INCREASE IN THE DIGITALIZATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, ESPECIALLY SINCE 2020. THE CHANGES WERE THUS PROMOTED IN A STATE OF EXCEPTION DURING THE CRISIS TO REGULATE GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THE CITIZEN'S PRIVATE SPHERE BUT HAVE LAID A ROADMAP FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGITAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH MAY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION OF A DIGITAL SOCIAL CONTRACT.THE SOCIAL CONTRACT APPEARS IN THE EU'S LIBERAL TRADITION AS A METAPHOR OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL, IT DEFINES THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY AS THE SET OF RIGHTS POSSESSED BY THE CITIZEN THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO SPECIAL PROTECTION. HENCE, THE SOCIAL CONTRACT SERVES AS THE BASIS FOR CREATING MODERN SOCIETIES, YET IT IS NOT PERMANENT AND CAN (AND WILL) CHANGE WHEN SOCIETIES CHANGE ACCORDINGLY. SEVERAL CRITIQUES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE ORIGINAL SOCIAL CONTRACT, CREATING NEW AND DEVELOPED CONTRACTS, INCLUDING THE CLASS CRITIQUE (FROM WORKER'S MOVEMENTS AND MARXISM DURING THE 19TH CENTURY TO PIKETTY'S PRESENT DENOUNCING OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES), THE GENDER CRITIQUE (AS CAROLE PATEMAN'S SEXUAL CONTRACT PUTS IT, THE SOCIAL CONTRACT INSTITUTIONALIZED PATRIARCHY), THE RACIAL CRITIQUE (WHERE CHARLES W. MILLS DEVELOPS THE GENDER CRITIQUE FROM A RACIAL POINT OF VIEW WHERE THE SOCIAL CONTRACT CREATED A SYSTEM OF DOMINATION BY THE WESTERN WORLD) AND FINALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRITIQUE (WHERE ITS ADVOCATES CLAIM FOR AN ECO-SOCIAL CONTRACT OR A NATURE SOCIAL CONTRACT THAT SHIFTS THE APPROACH TO A BIO-CENTRIC SYSTEM).THEREFORE, THE CONTRACT SERVES AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE CHANGED, AND IN THIS CASE, IT CHALLENGES THE EVOLUTION TOWARDS A DIGITAL SOCIAL CONTRACT. THE EVOLUTION OF INTERNET AND TECH STRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT THE WEB AND ITS PROCESSES HAS BEEN MARKED BY THREE STAGES: ITS BIRTH IN THE 80S BY THE HAND OF THE STATE AND LINKED TO MILITARY RESEARCH; ITS DEREGULATION DURING THE 90S AND THE PRIVATIZATION OF THE MAIN TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTERPRISES (IN THE CASE OF THE EU, THE DIGITAL POLICY FOLLOWED THIS TREND); AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF A DIGITAL SPHERE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, WHERE THE EU HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK AND CREATED A SET OF INSTRUMENTS TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION AND FREEDOM OF ITS CITIZENS WHEN THEY NAVIGATE THE INTERNET. WE CAN SEE HOW THE EU HAS RESPONDED TO GLOBAL DYNAMICS AT THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL REGULATION, PRIORITIZING TODAY A MULTI -STAKEHOLDER SYSTEM WITH SEVERAL ACTORS, AND COUNTERWEIGHTS AND LIMITS FOR BOTH COMPANIES AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS IN THEIR EXCHANGE WITH USERS ON THE INTERNET. WITH THE EMERGENCE OF NEW SPACES FOR SOCIAL RELATIONS SUCH AS IN THE DIGITAL SPHERE, NEW TYPES OF SOVEREIGNTY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHTS AND PRIVACY OF USERS (WE MUST NOT FORGET THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SEPARATION BETWEEN SPHERES, AS FEAR LIBERALISM REMINDS US, AND OF LIMITING EXCEPTIONALITY TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REALLY APPEAR AS SUCH). ONCE THE FOUNDATIONS ON WHICH THE MODEL OF DIGITAL GUARANTEES CAN BE DEVELOPED HAVE BEEN LAID, THE NEXT STEP CAN BE THE CREATION OF A REAL DIGITAL CONTRACT BETWEEN USERS AND THE STATE ON THE INTERNET. HOWEVER, THE CONTRACT IS BUT AN IDEA OF REASON FOR UNDERSTANDING POLITICS AND INSTITUTIONS, WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHAT DIGITAL POLITICS WE ASPIRE TO AS SOCIETIES.
582	OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE DEREGULATED, PRIVATIZED AND LIBERALIZED THEIR ECONOMIES. PARADOXICALLY, THEY HAVE ALSO RETAINED OR EVEN STRENGTHENED THEIR LABOUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THIS COMPROMISE HAS CREATED ENORMOUS POLITICAL TENSION, WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF AS RECURRENT CALLS FOR EITHER A ROLLBACK OR A DEEPENING OF REFORMS. FEW OF THESE CALLS HAVE BEEN HEEDED, SO THE BURDEN OF RECONCILING THE CONFLICTING POLICIES ENDS UP BEING TRANSFERRED TO THOSE PUBLIC AGENTS WHO ENFORCE THE REGULATIONS ON THE GROUND. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE AGENTS ACT, THE LATITUDE THEY HAVE, THE LIMITS THEY FACE AND THE RESULTS THEY ACCOMPLISH, THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW LABOUR INSPECTORS AND PROSECUTORS INTERVENED IN FOUR BELEAGUERED INDUSTRIES IN BRAZIL. IT FINDS THAT ENFORCEMENT AGENTS OFTEN DO MORE THAN JUST IMPOSE FINES OR TEACH INFRINGERS ABOUT THE LAW. RATHER, THEY USE THEIR DISCRETION AND LEGAL POWERS TO REALIGN INCENTIVES, RESHAPE INTERESTS AND REDISTRIBUTE THE RISKS, COSTS AND BENEFITS OF COMPLIANCE ACROSS A TAILOR-MADE ASSEMBLAGE OF PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND NON-PROFIT ENTERPRISES IN A WAY THAT MAKES COMPLIANCE EASIER FOR ALL INVOLVED. ON A BROADER CANVAS, REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WHO PERFORM THIS ROLE CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FOOT SOLDIERS OF A POST-NEOLIBERAL OR NEO-DEVELOPMENTAL STATE.
583	THIS ARTICLE USES THE CASE OF THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN RUSSIA TO REVEAL A NEW MECHANISM OF AUTHORITARIAN RESILIENCE, WHICH IT CALLS INFRASTRUCTURAL. THIS MECHANISM COMPLEMENTS THE CURRENTLY DOMINANT EXPLANATION OF AUTHORITARIAN RESILIENCE FOCUSED ON MATERIAL REDISTRIBUTION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE ABILITY OF AN AUTOCRAT TO IMPLEMENT POLITICAL DECISIONS ON THE GROUND. THIS MECHANISM CAN PARTIALLY EXPLAIN VLADIMIR PUTIN'S STRONG PERFORMANCE AT THE 2012 ELECTION, WHICH WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE ENGAGEMENT OF SCHOOLTEACHERS, WHO FREQUENTLY SERVED AS MEMBERS OF PRECINCT-LEVEL ELECTORAL COMMISSIONS, IN AGITATION AND ELECTORAL FRAUD. THE ARTICLE FINDS THAT IF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE PRESSURE ON TEACHERS WERE ELIMINATED, VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT NOT HAVE WON THE ELECTION IN THE FIRST ROUND.
584	THE STUDY INVESTIGATES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANTECEDENTS AND ADVANTAGES OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR THE OLD UNDER THE LAW GOVERNING THE AGED. THIS PAPER STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON PSYCHOLOGICAL EMOTION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS BY EMPLOYING A QUESTIONNAIRE AND REFERRING TO THE LAW OF OLDER PEOPLE. THE STUDY DISCOVERED THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR THE ELDERLY DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF EXERCISE PERFORMED EACH WEEK AND THE TIME SPENT EXERCISING. INDIVIDUALS WHO EXERCISE MORE THAN FIVE TIMES PER WEEK AND FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES ARE MORE MENTALLY HEALTHY. PHYSICAL EXERCISE CAN NOT ONLY IMPROVE MOOD, ENHANCE SELF-CONCEPT AND COORDINATE INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS, BUT ALSO ELIMINATE FATIGUE, REDUCE STRESS RESPONSE, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE MENTAL DISEASES TO INDEED PROMOTE THE FITNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH OF THE ELDERLY.
585	CONTEMPORARY CONFLICTS ARE SELDOM CONTAINED WITHIN NATION STATES. THE CROSS-BORDER NATURE OF VIOLENCE HAS PROMPTED SCHOLARS TO CALL FOR A REGIONAL APPROACH TO TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE (TJ). THIS ARTICLE FURTHERS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE REGIONAL DIMENSION OF POSTCONFLICT JUSTICE BY ADDRESSING THE PUZZLE OF WHETHER DISCOURSE IN REGIONAL-LEVEL DEBATES IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN NATIONAL-OR LOCAL-LEVEL DEBATES. IT APPLIES A COMMUNICATIVE DELIBERATION PERSPECTIVE BY FOCUSING ON THE PATTERNS OF TALK DURING CIVIL SOCIETY DELIBERATIONS ON POSTCONFLICT JUSTICE. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS BASED ON THE UNIQUE REGIONAL CIVIL-SOCIETY-LED PROCESS IN THE BALKANS THAT AIMS TO ESTABLISH A REGIONAL FACT-FINDING COMMISSION, KNOWN BY ITS ACRONYM RECOM. CRITIQUING STATE-CENTRED APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF TJ, THIS STUDY CONDUCTS MIXED-METHOD RESEARCH AND APPLIES TEXT ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES APPROPRIATE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF A LARGE VOLUME OF REGIONAL-LEVEL DATA. QUANTITATIVE TEXT ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT BY APPLYING A DICTIONARY METHOD TO OVER HALF-A-MILLION WORDS OF RECOM'S TEXTUAL DATA. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT REGIONAL-LEVEL DEBATES HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE DISCOURSE THAN NONREGIONAL DEBATES. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DISCURSIVE FRAMES EXPLORES THIS FINDING FURTHER, AND SHOWS THAT DELIBERATORS' ENDORSEMENT OF THE REGIONAL APPROACH TO TJ RESTS ON A SET OF HISTORICAL, PRESENT AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS, UNDERPINNED BY A SENSE OF REGIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
586	THE CRIME OF DELIBERATELY RENDERING AN ARBITRAL AWARD IN VIOLATION OF LAW WAS PROVIDED AT THE END OF ARTICLE 20 OF THE AMENDMENT VI TO THE CRIMINAL LAW OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. SUCH A CRIME IS LIKELY TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE VIEWS ARE SHARPLY DIVIDED ON ITS IMPLICATION AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION. IN ADDITION, PERTINENT PROVISIONS ARE NOT MANIPULABLE. THE WORDING OF VIOLATION OF LAW SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN ARTICLES OF THE LAW, AS LEGALESE. THE CHARGE IS THE PRODUCT OF REDUNDANT LEGISLATION, WHOSE PROVISIONS ARE BOUND TO BE CONSIDERED AS PIECES OF BLANK PAPER. THE CREATION OF THE CRIME DISRESPECTS ARBITRATION, AND REMOVES THE PECULIARITIES OF IT. THE CHARGE OF THE CRIME UNDERMINES THE PROFESSION OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. THEREFORE, THE CRIME SHOULD BE REPEALED. WHERE CASES WERE ARBITRATED WRONGLY, AND SOCIAL HARMS WERE CAUSED, CRIMINAL LAW AND OTHER LAWS WOULD SERVE AS REMEDIES.
587	CAN MYTHOLOGY BE A FORM OF CRITICAL THEORY IN THE SERVICE OF RIGHT? FROM THE STANDPOINT OF AN ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION, THE ANSWER IS NO. MYTHOLOGY IS CHARACTERISED BY IRRATIONALITY, AND WORKS TO MYSTIFY REALITY, WHILST CRITICAL THEORY IS SET AGAINST THE IRRATIONAL, ITS ENTIRE FORCE DIRECTED AT DEMYSTIFYING REALITY. IN A POST-ENLIGHTENMENT TRADITION, REASON, INCLUDING CRITICAL REASON, MAY TAKE MYTHOLOGICAL FORM-INDEED, THERE IS IDENTITY AS MUCH AS NON-IDENTITY BETWEEN THE TWO FORMS, A MIMETIC RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH THE RATIONAL CANNOT BE FREED OF THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANY MORE THAN MYTH CAN STAND OUTSIDE REASON. HOWEVER, THE WORK OF CRITICAL THEORY REMAINS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME. WHETHER IN THE FORM OF RATIONAL MYTH OR MYTHOLOGICAL REASON, CRITICAL THEORY MUST REMAIN IN THE SERVICE OF RIGHT IN THE SENSE OF 'THE TRUE', AND THUS REMAINS AN ENLIGHTENMENT PROJECT. IN CONTRAST, THE AIM OF THIS ESSAY IS TO PUT FORWARD A MODEL OF CRITICAL THEORY THAT IS SYMPATHETIC WITH MYTHOLOGY, NOT ONLY IN ITS FORM, BUT ALSO IN THE WORK THAT IT DOES, WHICH IS NOT IN THE SERVICE OF THE TRUE BUT OF THE GOOD. THAT MODEL IS PETER FITZPATRICK'S SEMINAL WORK OF JURISPRUDENCE, THE MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN LAW (1992). AFTER ADDRESSING HOW FITZPATRICK'S MYTHOLOGY IS IN THE FORM OF A NEGATIVE MYTHOLOGY, THE ESSAY ELABORATES THE CRITICAL WORK OF SUCH MYTHOLOGICAL CRITICAL THEORY. IN THE CASE OF MYTHOLOGY, THAT WORK INVOLVES CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR A MYTHOLOGICAL LEGAL PLURALISM, THROUGH THE DECOLONISATION OF LAW.
588	THIS PAPER ESTIMATES THE EFFECT THAT WEALTH AND POWER HAVE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE OUTCOMES BY EXPLOITING THE RANDOM MATCHING OF DRIVERS TO PEDESTRIANS IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. IF JUSTICE IS IMPARTIAL, WE SHOULD OBSERVE THE SAME SHARE OF RICH OFFENDERS BOTH FOR POOR AND RICH VICTIMS, CONDITIONAL ON LOCATION AND TIME. RICH VICTIMS ACT AS A CONTROL GROUP TO ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF MISSING RICH OFFENDERS WHOSE VICTIMS ARE LESS POWERFUL. I USE THIS ESTIMATION APPROACH ON DATA FROM RUSSIA, AND FIND THAT ITS JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT IMPARTIAL. THE SAME APPROACH CAN BE APPLIED NOT ONLY TO OTHER COUNTRIES BUT ALSO TO OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THAT SHOULD BE IRRELEVANT TO JUDICIAL OUTCOMES IN AN IMPARTIAL LEGAL SYSTEM, SUCH AS RACE AND GENDER.
589	MIGRANT LABOR IS WIDELY USED IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN MANY PARTS OF TURKIYE ESPECIALLY DURING THE HARVESTING SEASON. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE PRECARITIZATION PROCESS OF SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL LABOR MARKETS IN TURKIYE BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW THREE REGIMES-MIGRATION MANAGEMENT, LABOR BONDING AND RECRUITMENT-WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY TO REGULATE MIGRANT LABOR SUPPLY. BY ATTRACTING VULNERABLE AND CHEAP LABOR OF SYRIAN, AZERI AND GEORGIAN WORKERS, THE TURKISH AGRICULTURAL SECTOR HAS EXTENDED ITS REACH TO THE MOST DISADVANTAGED GROUPS AND INTENSIFIED THE PRECARITIZATION OF THE LABOR FORCE. BASED ON EMPIRICAL FINDINGS FROM PREVIOUS FIELDWORKS CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2019 IN VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL SITES THROUGHOUT TURKIYE, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT PRECARITIZATION IS NOT ONLY A RESULT OF WORKING CONDITIONS AND JOB CHARACTERISTICS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR BUT ALSO A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE THREE REGIMES WORKING HARMONIOUSLY AS THEY GENERATE COMPETITION AMONG DIFFERENT WORKER GROUPS FOR EXISTING JOBS. WHILE MIGRATION REGIME AND RESTRICTIONS ON MIGRANT LABOR DETERMINE MIGRANT AND REFUGEE LABOR'S LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS, INTERMEDIARIES AND ETHNIC TIES ALSO FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF PRECARIOUS LABOR INTO SEASONAL WAGE WORK. THE PAPER PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO THE DYNAMICS OF LABOR EXPLOITATION IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN TURKIYE AND THE NEED FOR REGULATORY MECHANISMS THAT PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.
590	FOLLOWING AN ANALYSIS OF SELECTED COVID-19 EMERGENCY INSTRUMENTS, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE CURRENT CRISIS INCREASES THE SALIENCE OF BOTH THE ADVANTAGES AND THE DRAWBACKS OF SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS. IT ARGUES THAT NOW IS A DECISIVE MOMENT FOR THE FUTURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION SOFT LAW, FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RESEARCH, AS WELL AS OF POLICYMAKING. IT IS NECESSARY TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED BY THIS CRISIS TO CLARIFY, WITHOUT IMPAIRING FLEXIBILITY, THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH SOFT LAW SHOULD BE ISSUED, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS THAT SUCH INSTRUMENTS CAN HAVE ABSENT LEGALLY BINDING FORCE.
591	THIS ARTICLE APPLIES EMERGING LITERATURE ON RESILIENCE IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS TO INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEMS. COMPLEX SYSTEMS THEORY PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TO ECONOMIC MODELS THAT ADOPT ASSUMPTIONS OF LINEARITY IN PROPERTY RIGHTS TRANSITIONS-WHERE INPUTS SUCH AS RISING RESOURCE VALUES INDUCE PROPORTIONATE OUTPUTS IN THE FORMATION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS. BASED ON A CASE STUDY OF CATASTROPHIC DISASTER, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN A COMPLEX PROPERTY SYSTEM DOES NOT INVOLVE PROPORTIONATE OR PREDICTABLE RESPONSES TO SUDDEN SHOCKS IN THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT. THE STOCHASTICITY OF INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE ARISES FROM ACTS OF ADAPTIVE SELF-ORGANIZATION ACROSS MULTIPLE SCALES OF PROPRIETARY GOVERNANCE. THE "ADDED VALUE" OF SYSTEMS THEORY IS A SET OF CONCEPTUAL TOOLS-SUCH AS SCALE, STOCHASTICITY, AND SELF-ORGANIZATION-WHICH HELP TO EXPLAIN RESILIENCE AND CHANGE IN PROPERTY SYSTEMS AFFECTED BY SUDDEN ENVIRONMENTAL SHOCKS.
592	DESIGNING PEACE AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BE SIGNED AND SUSTAINED CAN BE DIFFICULT IN CIVIL CONFLICT. MANY RECENT CASES OF SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENTS INCLUDE ELECTORAL PROVISIONS, OFTEN FOR REBEL GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE AS POLITICAL PARTIES. ENGAGING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, HOWEVER, CAN ALSO OPEN THE PEACE PROCESS TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE, POTENTIALLY DERAILING A SETTLEMENT OR SOME OF ITS PROVISIONS, PERHAPS ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO POLITICS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR PEACE PROCESSES, SPECIFIC ELECTORAL PROVISIONS, AND POTENTIAL CONCESSIONS THAT PROVIDE FORMER REBELS WITH PROTECTIONS, LEGITIMACY, AND POWER. USING A SURVEY EXPERIMENT IN COLOMBIA, WE FIND THAT THE PEACE PROCESS OVERALL IS MORE POPULAR THAN ITS ELECTORAL PROVISIONS, AND THAT REBEL ENDORSEMENT OF THE PROVISIONS FURTHER DIMINISHES SUPPORT. THESE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THE 2016 COLOMBIAN PLEBISCITE ON THE PEACE AGREEMENT FAILED AND TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DESIGN MATTERS TO AGREEMENT EFFECTIVENESS.
593	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMICS ON THE DEMAND FOR, AND DEPLOYMENT OF, INDICATORS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WORLD BANK'S INVESTMENT CLIMATE CAMPAIGN. THIS CAMPAIGN IS CHARACTERISED BY AN EMPHASIS ON MARKETISATION, MATHEMATISATION AND QUANTIFICATION, WHICH ARE RESPECTIVELY THE NORMATIVE, ANALYTICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES OF CHOICE IN MAINSTREAM ECONOMICS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT ECONOMICS GENERALLY, AND INDICATORS IN PARTICULAR, HAVE BROUGHT A CERTAIN DISCIPLINE AND ENERGY TO THE FIELD OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT. BUT THIS 'PROGRESS' HAS OFTEN BEEN AT THE EXPENSE OF NON-ECONOMIC VALUES AND INTERESTS, AND EVEN OF OUR ABILITY TO MOURN THEIR LOSS.
594	SECTION 211(3) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 PROVIDES THAT NO RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY NORMS MAY BE UPHELD IF SUCH NORMS ARE IN CONFLICT WITH EITHER THE CONSTITUTION OR ANY OTHER LAW THAT DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH CUSTOMARY LAW: "THE COURTS MUST APPLY CUSTOMARY LAW WHEN THAT LAW IS APPLICABLE, SUBJECT TO THE CONSTITUTION AND ANY LEGISLATION THAT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH CUSTOMARY LAW." THE CURRENT RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGES ACT 120 OF 1998 DEALS EXPLICITLY WITH THE RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGES WHICH ARE CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CUSTOMARY LAW (S 1). CUSTOMARY LAW IS DEFINED AS THE "CUSTOMS AND USAGES TRADITIONALLY OBSERVED AMONG THE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN PEOPLES OF SOUTH AFRICA AND WHICH FORM PART OF THE CULTURE OF THOSE PEOPLES". IT FOLLOWS FROM A FURTHER READING OF SECTION 1 THAT A CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE IS RESERVED FOR THOSE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN PEOPLES WHO OBSERVE SUCH CUSTOMS AND USAGES. IT IS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10(4) THAT "[D]ESPITE SUBSECTION (1), NO SPOUSE OF A MARRIAGE ENTERED INTO UNDER THE MARRIAGE ACT, 1961, IS, DURING THE SUBSISTENCE OF SUCH MARRIAGE, COMPETENT TO ENTER INTO ANY OTHER MARRIAGE". THIS MUST BE READ WITH THE DEFINITIONS CONTAINED IN SECTION 1: "'CUSTOMARY LAW' MEANS THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES TRADITIONALLY OBSERVED AMONG THE INDIGENOUS AFRICAN PEOPLES OF SOUTH AFRICA AND WHICH FORM PART OF THE CULTURE OF THOSE PEOPLES; 'CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE' MEANS A MARRIAGE CONCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CUSTOMARY LAW". WITHOUT THE REQUISITE LEGAL COMPETENCY, NO LEGAL SUBJECT CAN ENTER INTO ANY RELATIONSHIP TO WHICH THE LAW MAY ATTACH ANY CONSEQUENCES. NOBODY CAN ENTER INTO A CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE IF ANY OF THE PRESUMED FUTURE SPOUSES IS ALREADY IN A CIVIL MARRIAGE ACCORDING TO THE MARRIAGE ACT 25 OF 1961, NOT EVEN IF THE TWO PARTIES ARE MARRIED TO EACH OTHER. ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF VARIOUS INDIGENOUS NATIONS, IF A MAN ENTERS INTO A VALID CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE WITH A WOMAN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED BEFORE BUT WHO IS THE MOTHER OF CHILDREN BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK (SPURII), THE METAPHOR APPLIES THAT HE "WHO TAKES THE COW ALSO ACQUIRES THE CALF". HE WILL AS PART AND PARCEL OF THE LOBOLA CEREMONY BE SEEN AS THE ADOPTING STEPFATHER OF HIS WIFE'S CHILDREN, WITH ALL THE ACCOMPANYING CONSEQUENCES. HE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FUTURE MAINTENANCE OF THOSE CHILDREN AS HIS ADOPTIVE CHILDREN AND THEY WILL ACQUIRE ALL RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAT ARE BESTOWED ON A CHILD, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO INHERITANCE AND THE RIGHT TO HIS FAMILY NAME. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP, ALL LEGAL TIES WITH THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER OF THE ADOPTED CHILD ARE SEVERED AND THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER WILL NO LONGER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS OFFSPRING. IN JANUARY 2019 AN ERSTWHILE LAW PROFESSOR FROM UNISA WHO STILL RETAINED HIS GERMAN CITIZENSHIP, WAS GRAVELY ILL AND CARED FOR ON LIFE-SUPPORT AT A HOSPITAL IN THE PRETORIA DISTRICT. WHILE IN HOSPITAL, HE TIED THE MARRIAGE KNOT WITH MISS VILAKAZI, A ZULU WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. MISS VILAKAZI WAS A SPINSTER, BUT SHE HAD A ZULU DAUGHTER WHO WAS BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK MORE THAN EIGHT YEARS PREVIOUSLY OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ERSTWHILE ZULU LOVER. THIS CHILD HAD BEEN IN THE CARE OF HER MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER IN NATAL AND, ACCORDING TO ZULU CUSTOMARY NORMS, WAS CONSIDERED PART OF THE HOUSE OF HER MATERNAL GRANDFATHER, VILAKAZI. SHE CONSEQUENTLY CARRIED THE NAME VILAKAZI AS HER REGISTERED SURNAME ON HER OFFICIAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THE MARRIAGE, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED ON 29 JANUARY 2019 IN THE HOSPITAL IN PRETORIA, WAS CONCLUDED WITH ADHERENCE TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF ACT 25 OF 1961. THE CIVIL MARRIAGE WAS DULY REGISTERED AS SUCH. THE LATE PROFESSOR PASSED AWAY IN THE HOSPITAL BARELY THREE WEEKS LATER ON 19 FEBRUARY 2019. LESS THAN 24 HOURS BEFORE THE DEMISE OF THE PROFESSOR A PURPORTED CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE WAS CONCLUDED, APPARENTLY ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSOR WITH THE RECENTLY MARRIED MRS SCHULZE BY PROXY BY A FRIEND OF HIS IN THE NEWCASTLE DISTRICT IN NATAL AFTER HAVING PAID R60 000 AS ILOBOLO. THE CEREMONY WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE CEREMONIAL SLAUGHTERING OF THE PRESCRIBED GOAT. HOWEVER, DURING THIS CEREMONY THE GROOM WAS NOT PRESENT BUT ON LIFE SUPPORT IN A PRETORIA HOSPITAL AND NOT NECESSARILY COMPOS MENTIS - THE COURT WAS TOLD THAT HE WAS REPRESENTED BY A FRIEND. ZULU CUSTOMARY LAW, HOWEVER, DOES NOT RECOGNISE A MARRIAGE CONCLUDED BY PROXY WITH A SUBSTITUDE BRIDEGROOM AS WAS KNOWN IN ROMAN-DUTCH LAW AS "A WEDDING WITH THE GLOVE". NEITHER THE MARRIAGE ACT NOR THE RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGES ACT, HOWEVER, RECOGNISES A SECOND MARRIAGE AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF A CIVIL MARRIAGE BY ANY OF THE PURPORTED NEWLY WEDS - EVEN IF BOTH "SPOUSES" HAD BEEN PRESENT IN PERSON. THE MOTHER OF THE LATE PROFESSOR SCHULZE, AFTER HIS DEMISE IN SOUTH AFRICA, AMENDED HER LAST WILL IN GERMANY AND APPOINTED HER LIFELONG PARTNER AS SOLE BENEFICIARY OF HER SIGNIFICANT ESTATE. SHE PASSED AWAY IN GERMANY IN OCTOBER 2019. IN NOVEMBER 2019 THE RECENTLY MARRIED MRS SCHULZE, ON BEHALF OF HER MINOR DAUGHTER, SUCCESSFULLY APPROACHED THE HIGH COURT IN PIETERMARITZBURG, WHERE ZACA AJ ISSUED AN ORDER COMPELLING THE SOUTH AFRICAN DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS TO ISSUE THE DAUGHTER WITH A NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE THAT REFLECTS THE LATE PROFESSOR SCHULZE AS HER FATHER. NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASE OF THE OFFICIALS AT HOME AFFAIRS WITH THIS COURT ORDER, THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS, MR MOTSOALEDI, PERSONALLY INTERVENED IN AUGUST 2020 AND THE NEW BIRTH CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED AS REQUESTED. RELYING ON THIS NEWLY ISSUED BIRTH CERTIFICATE, THE APPLICANT CLAIMS AN AMOUNT OF NOT LESS THAN R8 MILLION IN GERMANY FROM THE ESTATE OF THE LATE MOTHER OF PROFESSOR SCHULZE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE APPLICANT RELIES ON A PRINCIPLE IN GERMAN LAW, THE PFLICHTTEILSANSPRUCH, ACCORDING TO WHICH ANY DESCENDANT OF THE DECEASED HAS A RIGHT TO A PRESCRIBED PORTION, A SO-CALLED LEGITIMATE PORTION OF THE ESTATE, IF NOT MENTIONED OR SUFFICIENTLY BESTOWED IN THE LAST WILL. THIS RAISES A NUMBER OF SERIOUSLY FLAWED LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT ARE ANALYSED IN THIS ARTICLE. IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THE PERCEIVED LOBOLA MARRIAGE CEREMONY CONDUCTED ON BEHALF OF THE LATE PROFESSOR ON 18 FEBRUARY 2019 IN NEWCASTLE, LESS THAN 24 HOURS BEFORE HIS DEMISE, IS VOID BECAUSE OF THE EXPLICIT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION AND THE RELEVANT SECTION 10(4) OF THE RECOGNITION OF CUSTOMARY MARRIAGES ACT 120 OF 1998, WHICH EXCLUDES ANY COMPETENCY TO ENTER INTO A CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE IF ANY OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED IS ALREADY MARRIED. AT THE DATE OF THE PERCEIVED LOBOLA CEREMONY, MRS SCHULZE HAD ALREADY BEEN CIVILLY MARRIED TO PROFESSOR SCHULZE FOR MORE THAN THREE WEEKS AND THUS BOTH SPOUSES LACKED THE NECESSARY COMPETENCY TO ENTER INTO A VALID CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE. WHETHER A VALID CUSTOMARY MARRIAGE COULD HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AT ALL WITH A MAN WHO DID NOT LIVE ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOMS AND USAGES OF THE ZULU, IS ALSO HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE. BECAUSE THE PERCEIVED LOBOLA MARRIAGE IS A NULLITY, NO LEGAL CONSEQUENCES CAN FLOW FROM THIS NULLITY AND THE SO-CALLED CUSTOMARY ADOPTION OF THE DAUGHTER ("THE CALF WITH THE COW") IS A NULLITY TOO. AT NO STAGE WAS ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VALID ADOPTION AS GOVERNED BY THE CHILDREN'S ACT 38 OF 2005 ADHERED TO. THE MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY GIVEN NOTICE OF APPEAL AFTER THE UNCONVINCING JUDGMENT OF ZACA AJ WAS HANDED DOWN IN JANUARY 2020. AS THE RESPONSIBLE MINISTER, HE SHOULD GUARD THE UPHOLDING OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE APPLICABLE LEGAL PROVISIONS UNAMBIGUOUSLY CONTAINED IN THE RELEVANT SECTION 10(4) OF ACT 120 OF 1998. IT IS A PITY THAT THE SO-CALLED ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE "RULE OF LAW" IS NOT EVEN PAID LIP SERVICE IN THIS CASE. BENNETT, AS A RENOWNED EXPERT ON CUSTOMARY LAW, CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT THE LEGAL ORDERS ARE NOT UNCONNECTED. IT MAY NEVER BE ASSUMED THAT THE PEOPLE CONCERNED ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO MANIPULATE THE RESOURCES OFFERED THEM BY LEGAL PLURALISM (A SOURCEBOOK OF AFRICAN CUSTOMARY LAW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA (1991) 50).
595	DESPITE THE INCREASING FOCUS ON PRISON INSPECTION AND MONITORING BODIES IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLICY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR OPERATIONS IN PRACTICE. THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO FILL THIS GAP BY EXAMINING HOW COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE RESPONDED TO THESE DEMANDS, PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ONE OF THE CENTRAL TASKS OF THESE BODIES: THE MAKING OF RECOMMENDATIONS. TO DO SO, WE USED DATA FROM THE FIRST EU-WIDE SURVEY OF PRISON OVERSIGHT BODIES, WITH RESPONSES FROM ALL MEMBER STATES. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THAT RECOMMENDATIONS-MAKING IS A KEY PART OF THE WORK OF THESE BODIES. THEY ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCES THAT THE APPROACH TO DIALOGUE BETWEEN THESE BODIES AND PRISON AUTHORITIES ADVOCATED IN THE LEGISLATION IS TAKING PLACE ON THE GROUND.
596	PRETRIAL DETENTION IN CHINA IS NOT SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE SUSPECT IS USUALLY DETAINED THROUGH THE WHOLE PRE-TRIAL AND TRIAL STAGES IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING. CHINA'S ONGOING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE THIS PRACTICE IN ORDER TO OFFER MORE PROTECTIONS TO SUSPECTS THROUGH REVISING THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW. THIS ARTICLE, FRAMED IN THE THEORY OF "LIVING LAW", TAKES AN INSIDER APPROACH BY LOOKING INTO THE DEMARCATION OF POWER AND INTEREST AMONG VARIOUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE AUTHORITIES AND INTERNAL UNITS WITHIN THE PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATES ALONG WITH CHINA'S DETENTION REFORM. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS BASED ON INTENSIVE INTERVIEWS OF "INSIDERS" SHOW A DIFFERENT PICTURE FROM WHAT OUTSIDERS MAY EXPECT. THE POWER STRUGGLES AMONG CRIMINAL JUSTICE AUTHORITIES AND INTERNAL UNITS WITHIN THE PROCURATORATE FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE OF DETENTION REFORM. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME POSITIVE CHANGES IN PROVINCE AH'S PILOT PROJECT, SUCH CHANGES ARE UNSUSTAINABLE DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

597	STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENTS (SOFAS) ESTABLISH WHEN AND HOW THE DOMESTIC LAWS OF HOST GOVERNMENTS ARE APPLIED TO AMERICAN SOLDIERS. WHY DOES THE UNITED STATES SHARE JURISDICTION UNDER SOME SOFAS BUT NOT OTHERS? I ARGUE THAT U.S. SOFAS PROJECT A RACIALIZED CONCEPTION OF HOST STATE CAPACITY FOR GOVERNANCE OVER AMERICAN TROOPS ON FOREIGN SOIL. IT IS THROUGH THE NOTION OF "CAPACITY" THAT NON-WHITE HOST PARTNERS ARE STEREOTYPED AS POSSESSING INFERIOR COURTS AND LEGAL VALUES. THE UNITED STATES IS LESS LIKELY TO SHARE JURISDICTION WITH NON-WHITE MAJORITY HOST COUNTRIES. I MOTIVATE MY ARGUMENT WITH PRIMARY ACCOUNTS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN DEBATES OVER U.S. SOFA POLICY. THEN, I CODE U.S. SOFA JURISDICTION AND ESTIMATE ITS DETERMINANTS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE UNITED STATES IMPOSES CONCURRENT JURISDICTION TO GOVERN ITS INTERACTIONS WITH PREDOMINANTLY WHITE HOST STATES, ALLOWING THESE PEER COUNTRIES TO TRY U.S. PERSONNEL, WHILE WITHHOLDING THIS SAME RIGHT FROM MOST NON-WHITE HOST PARTNERS, CETERIS PARIBUS. I CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SECURITY FROM ITS RACIAL UNDERPINNINGS.
598	ARTICLE 36 OF THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION TELLS ONLY PART OF THE STORY ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA. THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES FIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 36. FIRST, THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES STATE ATHEISM AS AN OFFICIAL IDEOLOGY. ALL CHINESE CITIZENS, WHETHER RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE EDUCATED IN MARXIST IDEOLOGY AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. SECOND, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, ALONG WITH OTHER RIGHTS IN THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION, ARE MERELY LEGAL RIGHTS, RATHER THAN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS CAN THEREFORE PASS LEGISLATION LIMITING INDIVIDUALS' RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. THIRD, THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION ENUMERATES BASIC OBLIGATIONS OF CITIZENS THAT LIMIT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. FOURTH, ARTICLE 36 PROTECTS ONLY THE INNER FREEDOM OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF, NOT FREEDOM FOR RELIGIOUS PRACTICE. FINALLY, THE SECOND HALF OF ARTICLE 36 PLACES LIMITATIONS ON RELIGIOUS PRACTICES. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION IS THUS A HIGHLY LIMITED FREEDOM. TO IMPROVE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM PROTECTIONS IN CHINA IT IS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION RATHER THAN SIMPLY PROMOTE FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN ITS CURRENT FORM.
599	SOME ARGUE THAT LARGE PLATFORMS, SUCH AS ALPHABET/GOOGLE, AMAZON, APPLE, FACEBOOK AND MICROSOFT (OR GAFAM), ARE UNUSUAL IN THEIR NUMBER, PACE AND CONCENTRATION OF TECHNOLOGY MERGERS, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HARM MARKET COMPETITION. USING A UNIQUE TAXONOMY DEVEL-OPED BY S & P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE, WE CONDUCT A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF GAFAM'S M & A ACTIVITIES, COMPARING THEM TO THOSE OF OTHER TOP ACQUIRERS FROM 2010 TO 2020. WE FIND: (I) GAFAM COMPLETED MORE TECH ACQUISITIONS PER FIRM THAN OTHER GROUPS OF TOP ACQUIRERS, AND ACQUIRED YOUNGER AND MORE CONSUMER-FACING FIRMS ON AVERAGE. (II) THE TOP 25 PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS OUTPACED GAFAM IN TECH ACQUISITIONS PER FIRM SINCE 2018. (III) GAFAM ACQUI-SITIONS ARE LESS CONCENTRATED ACROSS TECH CATEGORIES THAN OTHER TOP ACQUIRER GROUPS, DUE, IN PART, TO AN "ACQUIRE-ADJACENT-AND-THEN-EXPAND" STRATEGY. (IV) OVER TIME, MORE AND MORE GAFAM AND OTHER TOP ACQUIRERS ACQUIRE IN THE SAME CATEGORIES. (V) NO EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT A GAFAM ACQUISITION IN A CATEGORY, COMPARED TO SIMILAR CATEGORIES WITHOUT GAFAM AC-QUISITIONS, IS CORRELATED WITH A SLOWDOWN IN THE NUMBER OF NEW ACQUIRERS ACQUIRING IN THAT CATEGORY. OVERALL, WE FIND THAT TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITIONS DO NOT SHIELD GAFAM FROM POTENTIAL COMPETITION THAT MAY ARISE FROM OTHER GAFAM MEMBERS OR OTHER FIRMS THAT ACQUIRE IN THE SAME CATEGORIES.& COPY; 2022 ELSEVIER B.V.

600	THE MEDIATION OF DISPUTES BY COMMUNITY LEADERS IN CHINA HAS DEEP HISTORICAL ROOTS AND HAS LONG BEEN AMONG THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF NEIGHBOURHOODS AND VILLAGES. WHILE MOST RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC HAS LOOKED AT CITIES, MEDIATION IS IN FACT MORE COMMON IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. THIS PAPER DRAWS ON A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2002 (N=2,164) AND REPEATED IN 2010 (N=2,659), COVERING 23 VILLAGES IN FIVE PROVINCES, WHICH PROVIDES DETAILED DATA ON CONFLICT FROM DISPUTANTS THEMSELVES. WE EXAMINE THE EVOLUTION OF THIS MUCH-DEBATED MODE OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND ASSESS ITS PREVALENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS RELATIVE TO ALTERNATIVES. WE FIND THAT, EVEN AS OVERALL RATES OF DISPUTING DECLINED, SEEKING INTERVENTION BY VILLAGE AUTHORITIES REMAINED AS COMMON A RESPONSE TO DISPUTES IN 2010 AS IT WAS EIGHT YEARS PRIOR. THE PAPER THUS SHEDS LIGHT ON A PRIMARY MEANS THROUGH WHICH THE PARTY-STATE HAS TRIED TO MAINTAIN STABILITY, TAMP DOWN STRIFE, AND ASSERT ITS PRIMACY AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL.
601	LEVERAGING NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS AND 2,160 MONTHS OF CONSTITUENCY DEVELOPMENT FUND (CDF) SPENDING BY LEGISLATORS IN GHANA, I EXAMINE WHETHER AND HOW FAIRER ELECTIONS PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSIVENESS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INCUMBENTS ELECTED FROM CONSTITUENCIES THAT WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO INTENSIVE ELECTION-DAY MONITORING DURING GHANA'S 2012 ELECTION SPENT 19 PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE OF THEIRCDFS DURING THEIR TERMS IN OFFICE COMPARED WITH THOSE ELECTED FROM CONSTITUENCIES WITH FEWER MONITORS. LEGISLATORS FROM ALL TYPES OF CONSTITUENCIES ARE EQUALLY PRESENT IN PARLIAMENT, SUGGESTING THAT HIGH LEVELS OFMONITORING DO NOT CAUSE POLITICIANS TO SUBSTITUTE CONSTITUENCY SERVICE FOR PARLIAMENTARY WORK. TESTS OF CAUSAL MECHANISMS PROVIDE SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE THAT FAIRER ELECTIONS MOTIVATE HIGH PERFORMANCE THROUGH INCUMBENTS' EXPECTATIONS OF ELECTORAL SANCTION ANDNOT THE SELECTION OF BETTER CANDIDATES. THEARTICLE PROVIDES CAUSAL EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF ELECTION INTEGRITY ON DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY.
602	IN 2017, TAIWAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ISSUED A DECISION RULING THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN UNCONSTITUTIONAL. CELEBRATED AS A VICTORY FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY READYING TAIWAN TO BECOME "THE FIRST IN ASIA" TO LEGALIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, THE DECISION'S REASONING DEMONSTRATED A REMARKABLE RESEMBLANCE TO OBERGEFELL V. HODGES IN THAT THEY BOTH EMBRACE FORMAL EQUALITY, ENDORSE MARITAL SUPREMACY, AND RENDER FEMINIST CRITIQUE OF MARRIAGE IRRELEVANT OR INSIGNIFICANT. THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION OF SOCIAL MOVEMENT DYNAMICS AND CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE HIDDEN HISTORIES OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND THE RISE OF MARITAL SUPREMACY, REVEALING HOW MARRIAGE EQUALITY HAS SERVED AS A SITE OF CONTESTATION WHERE VARIOUS VISIONS OF EQUALITY COMPETE AND WHERE LEGAL ORIENTALISM IS ENACTED AS WELL AS RESISTED. IT ARGUES THAT TAIWAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISION AND THE MARRIAGE EQUALITY MOVEMENT DEMONSTRATE A CASE OF MIGRATING MARRIAGE EQUALITY WITHOUT FEMINISM, PRESENTING CHALLENGES FOR TRANSNATIONAL FEMINISM IN TERMS OF ITS ABSENCE.
603	UNDERSTANDING COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MANAGING THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. HERE THE AUTHORS SHOW IN A LARGE GLOBAL STUDY THAT PARTICIPANTS THAT REPORTED IDENTIFYING MORE STRONGLY WITH THEIR NATION REPORTED GREATER ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PANDEMIC. CHANGING COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOUR AND SUPPORTING NON-PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN MITIGATING VIRUS TRANSMISSION DURING A PANDEMIC. IN A LARGE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION (STUDY 1, N = 49,968 ACROSS 67 COUNTRIES), WE INVESTIGATED SELF-REPORTED FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC HEALTH BEHAVIOURS (E.G., SPATIAL DISTANCING AND STRICTER HYGIENE) AND ENDORSED PUBLIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS (E.G., CLOSING BARS AND RESTAURANTS) DURING THE EARLY STAGE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (APRIL-MAY 2020). RESPONDENTS WHO REPORTED IDENTIFYING MORE STRONGLY WITH THEIR NATION CONSISTENTLY REPORTED GREATER ENGAGEMENT IN PUBLIC HEALTH BEHAVIOURS AND SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. RESULTS WERE SIMILAR FOR REPRESENTATIVE AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL SAMPLES. STUDY 2 (N = 42 COUNTRIES) CONCEPTUALLY REPLICATED THE CENTRAL FINDING USING AGGREGATE INDICES OF NATIONAL IDENTITY (OBTAINED USING THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY) AND A MEASURE OF ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE DURING THE PANDEMIC (OBTAINED FROM GOOGLE MOBILITY REPORTS). HIGHER LEVELS OF NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC PREDICTED LOWER MOBILITY DURING THE EARLY STAGE OF THE PANDEMIC (R = -0.40). WE DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL IDENTITY, LEADERSHIP, AND PUBLIC HEALTH FOR MANAGING COVID-19 AND FUTURE PANDEMICS.
604	PUMPING ELEPHANT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE LIVES OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD IN MILLIONS OF WAYS . DUE TO THIS SEVERE EPIDEMIC, ALL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ALL ASPECTS, MAINLY ECONOMIC. IT IS WIDELY DISCUSSED THAT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS AFFECTED THE WORLD ECONOMY. WHEN CONSIDERING THIS DIMENSION, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE WORLD ECONOMY, SOCIO-ECONOMICS, AND SUSTAINABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE RESEARCH FOCUSES ON MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF SOCIAL WELL-BEING DURING THE PANDEMIC, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, THE STATUS OF WOMEN, FOOD SECURITY, AND GLOBAL TRADE. TO THIS END, THE STUDY USED TIME SERIES AND CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA. THE SECOND-HAND DATA USED IN THIS STUDY COMES FROM THE WEBSITES OF MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. FROM THE ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY DATA, THE CONCLUSION OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC IS HUGE. THE MAIN FINDING OF THE THESIS IS THAT THE SOCIAL ECONOMY IS AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC, CAUSING HUGE LOSSES IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC WELL-BEING AND SOCIAL CAPITAL.
