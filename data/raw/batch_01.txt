0	THE RULE OF LAW HAS INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC ATTRIBUTES, SO IT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO LEVELS: THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. USING THE THINKING BEHIND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA IS BOTH NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE. CHINA SHOULD PUT INTO PRACTICE THE IDEA OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AT THE INSTITUTIONAL AND THE GOVERNANCE LEVELS, AND SHOULD AT THE SAME TIME PARTICIPATE IN THE UN'S RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES AND IN INTERNATIONAL RULE-MAKING, THEREBY EXTENDING ITS RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE POWER AND INFLUENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPHERE.
1	THIS ARTICLE REFERS TO A THEORETICAL REVISION OF THE TERM RULE OF LAW AND THE CONCEPT OF SOFT RULE OF LAW. IT FOCUSES ON HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND THE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE RULE OF LAW IN A CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACY. FINALLY, AS AN EXAMPLE, IT INTRODUCES A BRIEF REFLECTION ON THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS OF PERU AND ECUADOR, PERTINENT FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SOFT RULE OF LAW.
2	THE INTEGRATION OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION AND RULE OF LAW HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN TERMS OF THE CONCEPT BUILDING, CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS A SYNTHESIS OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, MODERN RULE OF LAW, AND CHINESE STYLE. IN TERMS OF THE TARGET MODEL, CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW MAXIMIZES EFFICIENCY THROUGH THE BUILDING OF UNIQUE RULE OF LAW SYSTEM AND THE INTEGRATION OF THE RULE OF LAW COUNTRY. IN TERMS OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES, CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW COULD BE INTERPRETED AND EXPLAINED FROM FIVE ASPECTS: SUBJECT SCALE, VALUE POSITIONING, CIVILIZATION FORM, SPATIAL DIMENSION, AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. ESSENTIALLY, THE CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW COMPREHENSIVELY HIGHLIGHTS THE NINE INTRINSIC REQUIREMENTS OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION, THUS PROVIDING STRONG GUARANTEE FOR ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE FORM OF CIVILIZATION, CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS CREATED A NEW FORM OF HUMAN RULE OF LAW CIVILIZATION, IN TERMS OF SUBJECT, OBJECT, CONTENT, AND PATH, AND CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE A DEVELOPMENT-BASED NEW FORM OF RULE OF LAW ADVANCEMENT.
3	TO THE EXTENT THAT THE WORK OF FERRAJOLI IS AN UNAVOIDABLE REFERENCE TO THE STUDY OF THE CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED THROUGH A DISCERNING VIEW, STRONGLY FOCUSED ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THEIR GUARANTEES, AS WELL AS HIS VIEW ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. THIS FOR TWO REASONS: FIRST, WE QUESTIONED, GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE WORLD SYSTEM, IF WE COULD TO ADVANCE IN THE BUILDING OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES, WITH SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT. SECONDLY, WE QUESTIONED ABOUT HOW IT RELATES THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION (AND ESPECIALLY THE SECURITY COUNCIL), WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
4	WITH ITS REVIVAL IN RECENT YEARS, RHETORIC HAS PROVIDED A SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE FOR MODERN PEOPLE. IF WE TAKE RHETORIC AS A FRAMEWORK TO RETHINK DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, WE MAY NOT ONLY GRASP A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THEM, BUT ALSO GAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF RHETORIC IN THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD. WE WILL FIND THAT RHETORIC WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, AND IS STILL FULLY ACCORDANT WITH IDEAS OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN MODERN SOCIETY. MOREOVER, RHETORIC CAN PROVIDE INTELLECTUAL SUPPORT TO THESE CONCEPTS.
5	ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE REPORT TO THE 20TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) IS A WELL-CONCEIVED SYSTEMATIC CHINESE MODERNIZATION THEORY, WHICH IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PROFOUND SUMMARIZATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION, AND ON THE MODERNIZATION THEORIES OF CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, A SECTION OF THE LAW-BASED CHINESE MODERNIZATION, FOCUSES ON THE SUBJECT OF RULE OF LAW. BREAKING THE MYTH OF WESTERN CENTRALISM, IT CREATES A NEW MODEL OF MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND PRODUCES A REVOLUTIONARY EFFECT ON THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW MODERNIZATION IN THE WORLD. IT PRESENTS DISTINCTIVE CHINESE FEATURES AND CHINESE VISION. LED BY THE CPC, IT IS AN INDEPENDENT EXPLORATION, PEOPLE-CENTERED, ORGANIZED, AND PLANNED, AND HAS LOFTY VALUE GOALS. DRIVEN BY MODERN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR WORLD PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT, THE PRINCIPAL TASK OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS AND A NEW FORM OF HUMAN ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. ITS GREAT MISSION IS TO BUILD CHINA INTO A MODERN SOCIALIST COUNTRY IN ALL RESPECTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, ENSURING THAT THE RULE OF LAW RUNS THROUGH ALL AREAS AND ASPECTS OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND CONSTRUCTION, SO THAT BUILDING CHINA INTO A GREAT MODERN SOCIALIST COUNTRY WITH THE HIGH-QUALITY RULE OF LAW CAN BE GUARANTEED.
6	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ADHERENCE THE RULE OF LAW IS A CROSS-CUTTING DETERMINANT OF GENDER INEQUALITY. WE GATHERED DATA FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED SOURCES TO CALCULATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN GENDER INEQUALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, USING A CROSS-SECTIONAL AND ECOLOGICAL DESIGN. DATA WAS COLLECTED BETWEEN 2017 AND 2019 FROM UNITED NATIONS (GENDER INEQUALITY, HEALTH, AND ECONOMIC DATA); POLITICAL FREEDOM FROM FREEDOM HOUSE; INCOME INEQUALITY FROM THE WORLD BANK; AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT. WE FOUND AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GENDER INEQUALITY AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, CONTROLLING FOR ECONOMIC INEQUALITY, POPULATION, GDP PER CAPITA, HEALTH EXPENDITURE PER CAPITA, EDUCATION, ETHNOLINGUISTIC FRACTIONALIZATION, AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. WHILE THE DESIGN OF THE STUDY DOES NOT PERMIT CAUSALITY TO BE INFERRED, WE PROPOSE HERE THREE PLAUSIBLE CAUSAL MECHANISMS, BORNE OUT IN OTHER STUDIES, WHICH SUGGEST IT: (1) WEAK ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS; (2) LEGAL FRAMEWORKS THAT TOLERATE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN; AND (3) CORRUPTION.
7	HOW DO THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL REPRESENTATION RELATE TO EACH OTHER? I ANSWER THIS QUESTION, HITHERTO NEGLECTED BY RULE-OF-LAW SCHOLARS, TAKING MY CUE FROM JOSEPH RAZ'S REVISION OF HIS CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND BY RELYING ON A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PREFERENCES AND INTERESTS, WHICH PERVADES DISCUSSIONS OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION. I ARGUE THAT POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES' ATTENTION TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS' PREFERENCES, AND NOT JUST THEIR INTERESTS, IS A NECESSARY FEATURE OF A CONCEPTION OF REPRESENTATION THAT EXPRESSES A ROBUST ALLEGIANCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THAT SUCH ALLEGIANCE IS BETTER HONOURED WHEN REPRESENTATIVES ARE RESPONSIVE TO PREFERENCES WARRANTED BY PUBLIC INTERESTS. I OFFER TWO GROUPS OF RULE-OF-LAW REASONS FOR THAT CLAIM. FIRST, BECAUSE RESPECT FOR PREFERENCES BY REPRESENTATIVES FACILITATES THE CONDITIONS FOR THE LAW TO BE OBEYED. SECOND, RESPECT FOR THOSE PREFERENCES THROUGH THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES' COLLECTIVE DECISIONS ALLOWS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOR NON-ARBITRARY CREATION AND APPLICATION OF THE LAW. I FINISH ADDRESSING A THREEFOLD OBJECTION TO MY RELIANCE ON PREFERENCES AS OBJECTS THAT REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN MAKING THEIR DECISIONS.
8	CHINESE MODERNIZATION SHOULD BE UTILIZED TO ADVANCE THE GREAT REJUVENATION OF THE CHINESE NATION ON ALL FRONTS AND BUILD A MODERN SOCIALIST COUNTRY IN ALL RESPECTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. BUILDING A MODERN SOCIALIST COUNTRY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES COORDINATED STEPS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW AROUND THE NEEDS OF SOCIALIST MODERNIZATION AND INTEGRATE THE PROCESS INSEPARABLY WITH VARIOUS SOCIAL UNDERTAKINGS. THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ALL ASPECTS IS ESSENTIALLY A MATTER OF COMPREHENSIVE LAW-BASED NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT. SUCH PROMOTION SHOULD FOLLOW THE NEW REQUIREMENT OF EXERCISING LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE ON ALL FRONTS, RESPOND TO THE NEW EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA WITH HIGHER STANDARDS, THEREBY ADVANCING THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW SYSTEM AND THE RULE OF LAW CHINA WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS.
9	THE IDEA OF THE PUBLIC POWER SUBMISSION TO THE LAW HAS GONE BEYOND THE STATE BORDERS AND, PROGRESSIVELY, MADE ITS WAY AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL BY MEANS OF A PRINCIPLE CALLED BY ANGLO-AMERICAN DOCTRINE THE "INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW". FOR SOME AUTHORS, THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO INTERSTATE RELATIONSHIPS, WITHIN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY, COULD DATE BACK TO THE XVIII CENTURY. HOWEVER, IT WAS UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO THAT THE RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS, FROM A STRICTLY INTERNATIONAL POINT OF VIEW, STARTED TO TAKE OFF AND BECOME A RECURRENT TOPIC FOR THE DOCTRINE AND THE PRACTICE OF THE STATES AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. IN SPAIN, UNFORTUNATELY THE STUDY OF THE POTENTIAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS HAS BEEN SCARCELY ADDRESSED. REGARDING THE LATTER, AND WITH THE AIM OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEBATE THAT SEEMS TO BE GENERATING WITHIN THE DOCTRINE OF OUR COUNTRY ON THIS QUESTION, WE ARE GOING TO ANALYZE THE GENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT THAT THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS EXPERIENCED AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL TAKE AS REFERENCE THE PRACTICE OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF UN RELATED TO THIS MATTER. IN THIS LIGHT, WE SHALL STUDY THE EVOLUTION AND GRADUAL CONCRETION THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS EXPERIENCED IN THE HEART OF THE UN WHICH WENT FROM THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF A NATIONAL MODEL OF RULE OF LAW TO THE POSTULATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL ITSELF..
10	IN COMMENTING ON THE ROLES OF ELIHU ROOT AND JAMES BROWN SCOTT IN THE FOUNDING OF THE PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE (PCIJ), FORMER INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) PRESIDENT ABDULQAWI YUSUF STATED "THERE CAN BE NO [INTERNATIONAL] RULE OF LAW WITHOUT A COURT TO APPLY IT." THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (ASIL)'S INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS INTEREST GROUP RECENTLY HOSTED A SYMPOSIUM EVENT TO PROBE THIS STATEMENT. WITHOUT REHASHING THE VOLUMINOUS SCHOLARSHIP ON THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THIS INTRODUCTION TO THE SYMPOSIUM WILL EXPLORE SPECIFICALLY WHETHER A COURT SUCH AS THE ICJ OR THE PCIJ IS A PREREQUISITE TO AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE INTERNATIONAL COURT SYSTEM AS CURRENTLY FORMULATED PLAINLY DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AS OFTEN DEFINED FOR DOMESTIC SYSTEMS. UNLESS WE ARE PREPARED TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, OR ONLY A PARTIAL OR DEVELOPING RULE OF LAW, THIS MEANS THAT THERE MUST BE AN ALTERNATIVE DEFINITION OF "RULE OF LAW" FOR INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, WHICH DOES NOT CONSIDER INTERNATIONAL COURTS AS A PREREQUISITE TO RULE OF LAW IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES, AND HIGHLIGHTS OTHER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND ARBITRATION. ACCEPTING THIS POINT DOES NOT DIMINISH THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS IN THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BUT DOES SERVE TO EMPHASIZE HOW OTHER MECHANISMS FILL IMPORTANT RULE-OF-LAW GAPS LEFT BY INTERNATIONAL COURTS. EACH OF THE ARTICLES THAT FOLLOW THIS INTRODUCTION ADDRESSES THESE MECHANISMS - INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES, SANCTIONS, INVESTIGATIVE MECHANISMS, AND AD HOC ARBITRATION - AND HOW EACH MECHANISM INTERACTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COURT SYSTEM.
11	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY PALOMBELLA'S WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ADDRESSES SOME FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN TRADITION? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE BY LAW? WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS "AN INSTITUTIONAL IDEAL CONCERNING THE LAW", AS STRESSED BY PALOMBELLA? WHAT IS ITS ROLE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE, AND IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE?
12	THIS STUDY ANALYZES THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW PARADIGM OF RULE OF LAW, DUE TO THE ABSORPTION OF ESSENTIAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE. IT IS A NEW PERSPECTIVE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY THE STATE, BUT ALSO CIVIL SOCIETY, INCORPORATING TO THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONALISM NEW VALUES (TOLERANCE, CONSENSUS, TRUTH, SOLIDARITY AND EFFECTIVE CITIZEN PARTICIPATION). CONSIDERING THE JURISPRUDENTIAL MATURITY IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND JOSE ROBERTO DROMI'S APPROACH TO "THE CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE FUTURE", WE ESTABLISH THE CONTOURS AND LIMITS OF TRANSITIONAL RULE OF LAW, HARMONIZING THE BROAD PROTECTION OF MINORITIES WITH THE RIGHT TO TRUTH.
13	WE PROPOSE HEREAFTER AN ANALYSIS OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE POST-COMMUNISM HAS DETERMINED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUSTICE AND, IN DOING SO, PRETENDED TO REORGANIZE THE POSSIBILITY FOR A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL COMMUNITY. GIVEN THAT THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION POINTS OUT TO A GAP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND JUSTICE, ONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND FOR WHAT REASONS. DOES THE RULE OF LAW HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR DOING JUSTICE? ARE THE LEGAL PROCEDURES ENOUGH? OR SHOULD WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS UNABLE TO DO JUSTICE? SUBSEQUENTLY, WE IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS THREE RADICALIZATIONS: THE ISSUE OF NORMATIVITY, THE ROGUE STATE AND THE HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN LAW AND JUSTICE. ULTIMATELY, THE POSSIBILITY OF JUSTICE DEPENDS ON A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING DEMOCRACY.
14	IN THIS ARTICLE, I IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF COMMONLY ACCEPTED ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE LITERATURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND SUGGEST THAT-WHILST THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCEPTED AS PART OF THE CONCEPTUAL NARRATIVE OF THE CONCEPT-THE COGENCY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS FALTERS WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED COLLECTIVELY. THIS ARTICLE REPRESENTS, IN MANY RESPECTS, BOTH A CRITIQUE OF CURRENT PRACTICESANDA RALLYING CRY IN RELATION TO FUTURE PRACTICES. THROUGH ILLUSTRATING THAT THE FORM OF CONCEPTUAL CHANGE ACROSS CANONICAL CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAWCANIMPACT THE RELATIVE LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY IN THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED AND RELIED ON IN THE OPENING OF SO MANY RULE-OF-LAW-FOCUSED WORKS, I DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE MUST-IF WE ARE TO PROVIDE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE ARGUMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTEMPORARY IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW-BE CONSIDERATION OF THEACTUALWAY IN WHICH CHANGE HAS OCCURRED ACROSS CONCEPTIONS. I ARGUE THAT CONSIDERATION OF COLLECTIVE COGENCY IS NECESSARY FOR CONCEPTUAL CLARITY AND ILLUSTRATE THE ESSENTIALITY OF DOING SO BY CONSIDERING THE ASSUMPTIONS IN RELATION TO TWO HYPOTHETICAL MECHANISMS OF CHANGE. THIS APPROACH ILLUSTRATES NOT ONLY THE GENERAL INCONSISTENCY, BUT ALSO THAT INCONSISTENCY VARIES BETWEEN THE MECHANISMS. THIS VARIANCE LEADS TO A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM: WITHOUT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CHANGE MECHANISM THATHASOPERATED ACROSS RULE OF LAW RELATED IDEAS, THERE IS NO WAY TO ASSESS WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW'S COMMON ASSUMPTIONS ARE, OR CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE, CONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER. I ALSO SUGGEST ONE WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
15	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ASSESS AN OBJECTION TO AMNESTIES CONFERRED IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CONTEXTS: THAT THEY VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER BEGINS BY SETTING OUT THE OBJECTION AND PRESENTING THREE POSSIBLE REPLIES TO IT. EACH IS ARGUED TO BE UNSATISFACTORY. THE CENTRAL CONTENTION OF THE PAPER, NAMELY THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE OBJECTION DEPENDS ON AMNESTIES' TERMS AND THE REASONS FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTRODUCED, AS WELL AS ON WHAT CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS OPERATIVE, IS THEN PRESENTED. THE ARGUMENT THAT AMNESTIES VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW ON ACCOUNT OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW, OR NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS CONTAINING BILLS OF RIGHTS, PROHIBITING THEIR USE WITHOUT EXCEPTION IS THEN REBUTTED. FEW AMNESTIES VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW FOR THIS REASON. FINALLY, THE PAPER ADDRESSES A FURTHER RULE OF LAW-BASED OBJECTION TO AMNESTIES THAT IS RELATED TO, YET DISTINCT FROM, THE OBJECTION THAT AMNESTIES VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THIS SECOND RULE OF LAW-BASED OBJECTION, AMNESTIES PREVENT, OR AT LEAST HINDER, THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. THIS OBJECTION IS COUNTERED BY DEMONSTRATING THAT AMNESTIES DO NOT ALWAYS PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW LESS EFFECTIVELY THAN TRIALS AND PUNISHMENT AND MAY EVEN, IN SOME CASES, BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
16	THE RULE OF LAW IS THE BASIC FORM OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW MODEL IS THE NECESSARY DIRECTION FOR THE GOVERNANCE OF ONLINE SOCIETY. ONLINE SOCIETY IS IN ESSENCE A NEW PATTERN OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND STRUCTURAL FORMS COMPRISING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CITIZENS, LEGAL PERSONS, ORGANIZATIONAL BODIES, ETC., FORMED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER ON THE BASIS OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY; AND ALSO A REFLECTION, EXPANSION AND EXPRESSION, SINGLY OR IN SYNTHESIS, OF VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FIELDS OF THE REAL ECONOMY, POLITICS, CULTURE, SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE RULE OF LAW MODEL OF INTERNET GOVERNANCE REFERS TO GOVERNANCE THEORIES, SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES THAT EMPLOY RULE OF LAW THINKING AND THE RULE OF LAW MODEL TO BRING THE ELEMENTS, STRUCTURES, PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS OF INTERNET GOVERNANCE INTO THE SCOPE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS OPERATIONAL TRACK. REVIEWING THE TORTUOUS COURSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE OF LAW INTERNET GOVERNANCE IN CHINA, SUMMARIZING USEFUL EXPERIENCE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF RULE OF LAW INTERNET GOVERNANCE, AND REFLECTING ON EXISTING LEGISLATIVE, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL DILEMMAS WILL ENABLE US TO BUILD UP A RULE OF LAW SYSTEM OF ONLINE GOVERNANCE WITH COMPREHENSIVE NOUNS, EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION, STRICT SUPERVISION AND STRONG GUARANTEES. THIS WILL BE MARKED BY CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS AND WILL ENSURE THE APPLICATION OF RULE OF LAW THINKING AND THE RULE OF LAW MODEL IN GOVERNING, OPERATING, USING AND SAFEGUARDING THE INTERNET, THUS ACHIEVING SOUND AND ORDERLY INTERNET OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE PATH OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ADVANCING THE MODERNIZATION OF THE INTERNET GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND GOVERNANCE CAPABILITY.
17	THIS REVIEW OUTLINES AN EMERGING AGENDA FOR ETHNOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. FROM A SURVEY OF STUDIES DONE ON THE RULE OF LAW IN AFRICA, ASIA, EUROPE, AND THE AMERICAS, THE REVIEW IDENTIFIES FOUR GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS MODE OF INQUIRY, NAMELY, THAT IT IS LOCATED, RELATIONAL, AND COMPARATIVE AND HAS EXTRINSIC VALUE. IT OFFERS THREE NONEXHAUSTIVE REASONS FOR INTERPRETING THE RULE OF LAW ETHNOGRAPHICALLY, WHICH ARE AS A COUNTERHEGEMONIC PRACTICE, IN RESPONSE TO COUNTERINTUITIVE OBSERVATIONS, AND AS A MEANS TO DO CONSTITUTIVE THEORIZING. CONTENDING THAT ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW INVOLVES SOME KIND OF STANCE TOWARD BOTH RESEARCH SUBJECTS AND OBJECT OF INQUIRY, THE REVIEW ADVOCATES FOR THE EXERCISE OF PASSIONATE HUMILITY: A CONVICTION ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW TEMPERED BY WILLINGNESS TO BE PROVEN WRONG THROUGH INQUIRIES IN CRITICAL PROXIMITY WITH SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY MEDIATED FACTS. RULE-OF-LAW ETHNOGRAPHY'S POSSIBILITY LIES IN ITS ATTENDING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT IS CLAIMED IN THE RULE OF LAW'S NAME AND WHAT IS REALIZED, NOT TO MAKE THE IDEA LOOK FOOLISH, BUT TO SHOW HOW IT EMERGES AND WHY IT PERSISTS THROUGH STRUGGLE.
18	THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS INHERENTLY READY FOR INSTRUMENTALIZATION IS ASSESSED THROUGH AN ENQUIRY INTO THE NOTION OF ABUSE, ON THE ONE SIDE, AND OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE OTHER. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF ABUSE, TRYING TO IDENTIFY ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND TO DEFINE ITS CONSEQUENCES. IN ORDER TO DO SO, A LINE IS FOLLOWED FROM THE DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES THAT CAN REGULATE AN INSTITUTIONAL 'PRACTICE' LIKE THE RULE OF LAW TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ENDS THAT WOULD BETTER QUALIFY THAT PRACTICE. AMONG THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STRESS THE POSSIBILITY AND IMPORTANCE OF ADOPTING LEGAL MEANS AGAINST ABUSE, NOT ONLY RELYING ON POLITICAL ACTION.
19	THE RULE OF LAW IS A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE EU' S IDENTITY. IT IMPLIES INTER ALIA THAT MEMBER STATES ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THIS PRINCIPLE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE NATIONAL REALM. IN THAT REGARD, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS AN ERGA OMES PARTES OBLIGATION: ITS INDIVISIBLE NATURE ENTAILS THAT EACH COUNTRY OWES IT TO THE EU, THE OTHER MEMBER STATES, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS. YET THE EU INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM REVEALS SOME SHORTCOMINGS AS TO THE OVERSIGHT ON SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES OF THE RULE OF LAW AT NATIONAL LEVEL, SINCE THE ARTICLE 7 PROCEDURE IS NOT A SOUND RESPONSE TO SYSTEMIC THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LIGHT OF A COUNCIL'S INVITATION, THE COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED A COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM, WHICH PROVIDES FOR A POLITICAL OVERSIGHT AIMED ESSENTIALLY AT ENTERING INTO A DIALOGUE WITH THE CONCERNED MEMBER STATE. THIS PAPER, WHILE CHALLENGING SOME CRITICAL REMARKS TO THE COMMISSION'S COMMUNICATION, ADVOCATES THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATIES. FINALLY, THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS SOME POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF THE COUNCIL'S CONCLUSIONS AIMED AT ENACTING A NEW POLITICAL DIALOGUE AMONG ALL MEMBER STATES WITHIN THE COUNCIL TO PROMOTE AND SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW.
20	GOING BEYOND THE ANALYTICAL MODEL OF THE HOLISTIC STATE IN RULE OF LAW DISCUSSION, WE CAN CLASSIFY THE RULE OF LAW INTO NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS BASED ON THE STAGES AND INCREMENTS OF ITS EXECUTION. THE PHENOMENON OF THE LOCAL RULE OF LAW REFLECTS THE STAGES AND INCREMENTAL PROGRESS OF BUILDING A RULE OF LAW CHINA. IT HAS A REALISTIC FOUNDATION IN SOCIETY AND A PROFOUND BASIS IN LEGAL THEORY. COMPREHENSIVELY ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA NECESSITATES GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT TO CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE ATTEMPTS AND EXPERIMENTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENABLE US TO EXPLORE AND INNOVATE THE DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THE RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS EMBODIED IN THREE DIMENSIONS: "TEXT-ACTION-CONCEPT." ASSESSMENT MECHANISMS AND INDICATORS FOR THE LOCAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD ALSO BE ESTABLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK. THE BUILDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SHOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED WITH ASSESSMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE NEED TO OPTIMIZE TOP-LEVEL DESIGN, CONDUCT EVALUATIONS OF LOCAL LEGISLATION, IMPROVE LOCAL RULE OF LAW WORK PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT AND USE A RULE OF LAW INDEX TO ASSESS THE LOCAL RULE OF LAW IN AN OVERALL MANNER.
21	AS A CRITICAL LENS TO ASSESS THE RULE OF LAW THE ARTICLE CONFRONTS THE OFTEN USED TERM OF CRITICISM LEVELLED AT IT: THAT IT IS INHERENTLY ELUSIVE OR UNCERTAIN. TAKING THIS AS A STARTING POINT THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHETHER THERE IS SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE IN THIS APPARENT UNCERTAINTY WHICH RENDERS THIS CHALLENGE BOTH MISLEADING AND ALSO APT TO NEGLECT KEY ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPT IN FAVOUR OF ADOPTING A VERSION OF RULE OF LAW BASED ON PREDICTABILITY. THE ARTICLE DEVELOPS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT CAN BE TERMED 'THE CONSTITUTIVE' DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH IT IS ARGUED HERE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED DUE TO AN EMPHASIS ON PREDICTABILITY AND ALSO 'REGULATORY' DIMENSION WHICH CONCENTRATES ON THE RULE OF LAW AS THE CONTROL OR RESTRAINT OF POLITICAL POWER. THE CONSTITUTIVE DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW EXPLORES THE MEANING OF THE FOUNDATIONAL MOMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE LANGUAGE USED TO EXPRESS THIS AS A BASIS FOR SOLIDARITY AND AS A POINT OF ORIENTATION DURING POINTS OF CONSIDERABLE CHANGE OR CRISIS. IN THIS REGARD THE ARTICLE ESTABLISHES THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND IDEAS ABOUT THE CONSTITUENT POWER WHICH REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT AND FURTHER REFLECTION. THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE, IN SECTS. 3 AND 4, TAKES THE THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CONSTITUTIVE DIMENSION TO THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSIDERS HOW THIS CONCEPT CAN PROVIDE A BASIS FOR CRITICAL REFLECTION REGARDING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF THE EU. THE FOCUS ON THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE EU IS TWO-FOLD: IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS IS A MOMENT OF STRESS ON THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE EU AND SHOWS UP THE COMPLEXITY OF THE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS CONTEXT. SECONDLY, GIVEN THE ASPECT OF THE EU AS A 'POLITY' UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND ITS RESPONSE UNDERSCORES THE PROBLEMATIC ASPECT OF THE CONSTITUENT POWER IN THE EU. THE ARTICLE PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY JURGEN HABERMAS IN RESPECT OF THE CRISIS AND ITS RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW. HABERMAS ARGUES FOR A RECIPROCAL UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL SOLIDARITY AND JUSTICE TO BE MADE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND RESPONSE TO THE EU ECONOMIC CRISIS AND A REJECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE FEDERALISM DOMINATED APPROACH WHICH IS CHARACTERISED BY A TECHNOCRATIC APPROACH TO POLITICAL QUESTION. HABERMAS' APPROACH IS NOTEWORTHY FOR THE MANNER THAT IT FOCUSES ON A RESPONSE WHICH ARTICULATES HOW THE CRISIS CAN BECOME A BASIS NOT ONLY FOR AN APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL SOLIDARITY BUT EQUALLY TO ALLOW EUROPE TO CONFRONT THE CONSTITUTIVE MEANINGS OF THE EU AS A LEGAL AND POLITICAL PROJECT.
22	OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, CHINA HAS SEEN A NUMBER OF PRACTICES EXPLORING THE EVALUATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SUM UP THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE EVALUATIONS, ANALYZE THE PROBLEMS THEY ENCOUNTER, DETERMINE THEIR DIRECTION NATIONWIDE, AND PUT FORWARD CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS. WITH THE ISSUING OF THE DECISION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CPC ON SOME MAJOR ISSUES CONCERNING COMPREHENSIVELY DEEPENING THE REFORM AND THE DECISION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CPC ON PROMOTING A NUMBER OF MAJOR ISSUES OF THE RULE OF LAW, EVALUATION OF THE RULE OF LAW FACES A TRANSFORMATION BOTH IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE. THE KEY POINTS IN THIS TRANSFORMATION ARE HAVING THE RIGHT ORIENTATION, INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS AND SOLUTIONS TO TRICKY ISSUES OF QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION; SUMMING UP EVALUATION OF EXPERIENCE; AND ELEVATING EVALUATION TO THE LEVEL OF THEORY. A PRECONDITION FOR ITS EFFECTIVE EVALUATION IS A SCIENTIFIC MECHANISM FOR EVALUATING THE RULE OF LAW; IN TURN, THE KEY TO A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION IS SOLVING THE PROBLEMS IN QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE RULE OF LAW; AND THE NECESSARY REQUIREMENTS FOR EVALUATION PRACTICE ARE SUMMING UP EVALUATION EXPERIENCE AND ELEVATING IT TO THE LEVEL OF THEORY. THE KEY TO INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS FOR EVALUATING THE RULE OF LAW LIES IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THIRD PARTY EVALUATION MODEL AND IN QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION THAT STARTS WITH PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.
23	IS ARBITRATION COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW? ARE ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS, INCLUDING IN THE SCOPE OF NECESSARY ARBITRATION, OUTSIDE THE RULE OF LAW? STARTING FROM THE GUARANTEES INHERENT TO A RULE OF LAW, NAMELY THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY, IMPARTIALITY OF JUDGES, EFFECTIVE PROTECTION BY THE LAW AND WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME, WE CONCLUDE THAT, IF THESE ARE RESPECTED, ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS FALL COMPLETELY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE RULE OF LAW. A SPECIFIC REFERENCE IS ALSO MADE TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION, WHICH, SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, IS ALSO PERFECTLY INCLUDED IN THE AMBIT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
24	IN ASSESSING COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE CONTESTED NATURE OF THE CONCEPT RENDERS THE USE OF A SINGLE THEORIST'S CONCEPTION OR, ALTERNATIVELY, THE ADOPTION OF A HYBRID CONCEPTION OPEN TO CRITICISM. THERE IS NO SETTLED AND PRACTICAL WAY TO DETERMINE RULE OF LAW NON-COMPLIANCE. IT IS ARGUED THAT BY LOOKING BEHIND THE CONCEPT'S CONTESTEDNESS, RULE OF LAW NON-COMPLIANCE CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS UNDERGIRDING CANONICAL CONCEPTIONS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY COMMON ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. BY TAKING THIS APPROACH, TWO NECESSARY RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS ARE DISTILLED: COMPREHENSION; AND, PROCEDURAL PELLUCIDITY. AS A RESULT OF THEIR ELEMENTAL NATURE, AN INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE ELEMENTS REFLECTS A TOTAL INABILITY TO SATISFY THE RULE OF LAW REGARDLESS OF THE CANONICAL CONCEPTION PREFERRED. THE METHODOLOGY SUGGESTED PROVIDES A PRACTICAL - THEORY AGNOSTIC - WAY TO IDENTIFY RULE OF LAW NONCOMPLIANCE BEYOND THE CONCEPT'S INHERENT CONTESTEDNESS.
25	THE PRESENT WORK AIMS TO ANALYZE FROM A LEGAL CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ELEMENT OF THE LEGAL DISCOURSE OF CAPITAL, AS WELL AS TO SHOW THE CONCRETE FORM THAT THE ORGANIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TAKES UNDER DEPENDENT CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE ABOVE, IT IS STRUCTURED IN THREE SECTIONS, THE FIRST ONE DELVES INTO THE LINK BETWEEN THE STATE, LAW AND RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION IN CAPITALIST MODERNITY; THE SECOND SECTION DEALS WITH THE CONFORMATION, FROM THE DOMINANT CAPITALIST IDEOLOGY, OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND, IN THE LAST SECTION, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MATERIALIZATION OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LATIN AMERICAN DEPENDENT CONDITION ARE ANALYZED.
26	WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO STUDY THE RULE OF LAW FROM CONDITIONS OF ITS ABSENCE? IN THIS RESPONSE TO SYMPOSIUM COMMENTATORS ON OPPOSING THE RULE OF LAW I SUGGEST THAT TO DO SO IS TO SITUATE THE RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO OTHER IDEAS WITHOUT RELATIVIZING IT; TO TAKE SERIOUSLY QUESTIONS OF WHAT ANIMATES PRACTICES IN ITS STEAD, INCLUDING THE QUESTION OF WHAT IDEAS MIGHT PLAUSIBLY OPPOSE IT. ADOPTING THIS MODE OF INQUIRY INTO COURTS IN MYANMAR, I PERCEIVED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LAW AND ORDER, AS COMMONLY ASSUMED, BUT IS ITS ASYMMETRICAL OPPOSITE. COMPETING NOTIONS OF ORDER INHABIT EACH, ONE ENDOGENOUS, THE OTHER IMPOSED. WHILE THE RULE OF LAW PUSHES TOWARDS POLITICAL EQUALITY, LAW AND ORDER REVEALS IN ITSELF A DEEP AFFILIATION WITH INEQUALITY. OPPOSING THE TWO DISPELS THE ILLUSION THAT LAW AND ORDER IS ELEMENTARY TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT OPENS UP ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF THINKING AND TALKING ABOUT BOTH THAT MIGHT BETTER EQUIP SCHOLARS TO DISCHARGE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY: NOT TO RESEARCH AND WRITE IN WAYS THAT CAN BE READILY INTERPOLATED INTO PROJECTS FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE RULE OF LAW TO PLACES WHERE IT IS ABSENT, BUT TO COMPEL DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLITICAL ACTION FOR THE RULE OF LAW, BY PROVINCIALIZING IT.
27	THE CONCEPT OF LEGISLATION AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN LEGISLATION AND THE RULE OF LAW. THERE IS A DUALITY TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE ALL SUBJECT TO LAW, AS WELL AS THE SET OF VALUES THAT THE IDEAL LEGAL SYSTEM OUGHT TO POSSESS. LEGISLATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LAW. IF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO HAVE EFFECT, IT MUST BE REFLECTED IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF LEGISLATION. THOSE CHARGED WITH DRAFTING LEGISLATION HAVE THE SKILLS, THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN LEGISLATION.
28	WORLD'S LEGAL CIVILIZATION. IT ENCAPSULATES PROFOUND HISTORICAL, THEORETICAL, AND PRACTICAL LOGIC, AND HAS CREATED A NEW MODEL OF MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY.THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) HAS CREATED A NEW PATH FOR CHINESE MODERNIZATION AND A NEW FORM OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION WHILE LEADING THE PEOPLE IN ADVANCING A GREAT SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION. CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS NEW PATH. WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF HISTORICAL INITIATIVE AND CONSCIOUSNESS, THE CPC HAS SOLIDLY GRASPED THE BASIC REGULARITY OF CHINA'S LEGAL DEVELOPMENT BASED ON ACTUAL NATIONAL CONDITIONS, AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY PIONEERED, UPHELD, AND EXPANDED CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL CONSTRUCTION DURING THE NEW-DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION HAS REFLECTED THE EARLY EXPLORATION OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW DURING THE PERIOD OF SOCIALIST REVOLUTION AND CONSTRUCTION HAS LAID A PRELIMINARY FOUNDATION FOR THE FORMATION OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE NEW GREAT SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION OF REFORM AND OPENING UP HAS FURTHER PROMOTED SUCH MODERNIZATION. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A LAW-BASED CHINA IN THE NEW ERA OF SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS MARKS A FURTHER EXPANSION AND DEEPENING OF MODERNIZATION. THEREFORE, CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ROOTED IN THE CHINESE LAND, CONFORMS TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA, AND DRAWS ON THE EXCELLENT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE
29	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO OFFER A DEFINITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT DOES THIS THROUGH CLARIFYING THE CORE OBJECTIVES OF A RULE OF LAW AND EXAMINING WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM COULD INCLUDE THEM. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE CAN BE A DEFINITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. THIS DEFINITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS NOT DEPENDENT ON A SIMPLISTIC APPLICATION OF A NATIONAL RULE OF LAW, AS IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. IT SEEKS TO SHOW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS RELATIVE, RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE, IN ITS APPLICATION, IS NOT TIED TO THE OPERATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ITSELF, AND IT CAN APPLY TO STATES, INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NON-STATE ACTORS. IT GOES FURTHER TO SHOW THAT THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW DOES EXIST AND CAN BE APPLIED INTERNATIONALLY, EVEN IF IT IS NOT YET FULLY ACTUALIZED.
30	IN THIS SHORT ARTICLE RONAN KENNEDY EXPLORES FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SURROUNDING THE USE OF ALGORITHMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR SOCIETY. HE STATES, THE ISSUES THAT ARE BURIED IN THESE SYSTEMS SHOULD BE A MATTER OF SERIOUS CONCERN FOR LAW AND LAWYERS AS WE TRY TO PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL VALUES IN THE 21(ST) CENTURY, AND WE TRY TO PROPERLY REPRESENT OUR CLIENTS' INTERESTS AGAINST SYSTEMS ERRORS THAT WE CANNOT EASILY IDENTIFY'.
31	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUNCTIONING OF MONEY AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE EXPLORE THE CLAIM THAT MONETARY STABILITY IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO OPERATE AND THAT PERIODS OF RAPID INFLATION AND DEFLATION STEMMING FROM MONETARY INSTABILITY ERODE AND UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. WE SUPPORT OUR ARGUMENT WITH PANEL DATA EVIDENCE AND FOUR DETAILED CASE STUDIES FROM THE ROMAN EMPIRE, THE WEIMAR REPUBLIC, THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE GREAT RECESSION. OUR CONCLUSIONS EXAMINE WHAT MONETARY INSTITUTIONS ARE MOST CONDUCIVE TO MAINTAINING MONETARY STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
32	BUILDING A LAW-BASED GOVERNMENT IS A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF THE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, WHILE USING EVALUATION TO CATALYZE GROWTH IS IN LINE WITH THE INCENTIVE PRINCIPLE OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES. SINCE CHINA STARTED TO IMPLEMENT REFORM AND OPENING UP OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO, RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL EVALUATION HAVE GONE THROUGH SEVERAL STAGES, EACH WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS. EFFORTS TO BUILD A LAW-BASED GOVERNMENT HAVE MET WITH SUCCESS, BUT WHAT THE COUNTRY NOW HAS IS ESSENTIALLY STILL GOAL-ORIENTED ASSESSMENT. AT PRESENT, THIS SUFFERS FROM THE LACK OF A CLEAR GOAL ORIENTATION OR DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONS, AN IMPERFECT TECHNICAL SYSTEM AND UNSOUND MOTIVATION MECHANISMS, NOT TO MENTION THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF EACH GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT GOING ITS OWN WAY, DUPLICATING EVALUATIONS OR BEING LEFT RUDDERLESS. DRAWING ON A COMBINATION OF VALUE RATIONALITY AND INSTRUMENTAL RATIONALITY AND USING GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION TO PROMOTE THE BUILDING OF A LAW-BASED GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY CONFORMS TO THE SPIRIT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND VALUE RATIONALITY IN GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE, BUT ALSO STRENGTHENS THE ROLE OF EVALUATION AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO CREATE NEW EVALUATION THEORIES, EXPAND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, INTRODUCING DIVERSIFIED EVALUATING ENTITIES, IMPROVE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS, STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONAL BUILDUP, AND FOSTER A PERFORMANCE-BASED CULTURE. IN ADDITION, REPLACING GOAL-ORIENTED ASSESSMENT WITH PERFORMANCE EVALUATION WILL HELP THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW DISCIPLINE-THE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF RULE OF LAW GOVERNMENT, THUS PROMOTING MULTIDISCIPLINARY EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE AND CREATE NEW PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEORIES IN CHINA.
33	DOES THE VERY NATURE OF "TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM" YIELD SPECIAL CHALLENGES FOR THE RULE OF LAW? USING CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AS A CASE STUDY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES TENSIONS BETWEEN TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, RELATED TO NON-RETROSPECTIVITY AND STABILITY OF LAW. REGARDING THE FIRST PRECEPT, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE "PAST ORIENTEDNESS" OF TRANSITIONAL CONSTITUTIONS IS IN TENSION WITH THE RULE OF LAW WHEN THOSE CONSTITUTIONS ATTEMPT TO CHARACTERIZE THE PAST REGIME IN A CERTAIN WAY AND/OR TO CONDEMN THE OLD, PRE-TRANSITION ELITES. REGARDING THE SECOND PRECEPT, A DEVICE OF "TRANSITORY" CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS UNDERMINES THE VALUES BEHIND THE IDEA OF CONSTITUTIONAL ENTRENCHMENT. THESE TENSIONS MAY PARTLY EXPLAIN THE RELATIVE UNPOPULARITY OF THE "TRANSITIONAL" PARADIGM IN CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY IN RECENT YEARS.
34	WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION 61/39 THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS ESTABLISHED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, AN EXPRESS DISTINCTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THIS RESOLUTION, THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAS FOCUSED THE DEBATE ON THE STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW FROM THE DEFINITION PROPOSED BY THE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN HIS REPORT THE RULE OF LAW AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES. IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR ANALYZES THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH HAVE BEEN EXTRAPOLATED TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AN AD HOC DEFINITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF THIS PRINCIPLE THAT, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS PAPER, WILL BE IDENTIFY AS THE RULE OF LAW AMONG NATIONS.
35	IN THE CONTEXT OF A RISE OF RULE OF LAW REFORM PROGRAMMES AFTER CONFLICT AND INCREASING INTERNATIONAL INTEREST IN GENDER MAINSTREAMING POST-CONFLICT INTERVENTIONS, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT GENDER MAINSTREAMING HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMES AFTER CONFLICT. IT ARGUES THAT DESPITE RHETORIC REGARDING GENDER MAINSTREAMING POST-CONFLICT INTERVENTIONS, RULE OF LAW REFORM PRACTICE SHOWS LITTLE COMMITMENT TO GENDER MAINSTREAMING, LARGELY FAILING TO TRANSLATE INTO SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES. CONSIDERING EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW PROGRAMMES IN FIVE PARTICULARLY GENDER-RELEVANT AREAS TAKE GENDER ASPECTS INTO ACCOUNT: CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM, SEXUAL AND GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE, ACCESS TO JUSTICE, THE USE OF INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND PROPERTY REFORM. IT FURTHER EXPLORES THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMING BY SITUATING RULE OF LAW REFORM IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF POST-CONFLICT INTERVENTIONS. LASTLY, IT PRESENTS IDEAS ON HOW TO INCORPORATE GENDER ASPECTS MORE EFFECTIVELY INTO RULE OF LAW REFORM.
36	EU ENLARGEMENT PROCESS TOWARDS THE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE 2003 THESSALONIKI SUMMIT. HOWEVER, THE EXPECTED DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMATION AND FOSTERING OF THE RULE OF LAW VALUES HAVE NOT BECOME A REALITY, WHILE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AS INEFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING ITS GOALS. IN PARALLEL, THE EU HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING INTERNALLY, AND, IN ORDER TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE, HAS DEVELOPED A MULTITUDE OF INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE SO FAR HAD LIMITED EFFECTS ON INTERNAL RULE OF LAW PROMOTION. THE PAPER SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR APPROXIMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW STANDARDS IN THE EU'S INTERNAL AND ACCESSION POLICIES. AFTER PROVIDING A BIRD'S-EYE-VIEW OF THE POSITION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN EU ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS WITH WB COUNTRIES, THE AUTHORS GO ON TO ELABORATE ON THE FOUR MAJOR CAUSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE EU'S LACK OF EFFECTIVENESS AND COHERENCE IN THE WB ACCESSION PROCESS. IN DOING SO, THE AUTHORS PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN INTERNAL AND ACCESSION RULE OF LAW POLICIES AND FOSTER A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CORE PRE- AND POST-ACCESSION VALUE IN THE EU.
37	THE NOTION OF "RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS" SIGNIFIES A CRITICAL INNOVATION AND EVOLUTION IN THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IT UNDERSCORES THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS IN THE LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE AND PRESENTS NEW TOPICS FOR THE THEORETICAL STUDY FOR RULE OF LAW. A PRECISE COMPREHENSION OF "RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS" NECESSITATES TRACING ITS ORIGINS AND ELUCIDATING ITS CORRELATIONS WITH BOTH "RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS" AS WELL AS WITH "INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW." ACKNOWLEDGING BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PREROGATIVES, WHILE HOLISTICALLY ADVANCING LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE, CONSTITUTES THE FOUNDATIONAL RATIONALE BEHIND "RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS." IN ADDITION, THE COGNITIVE TRANSITION FROM A "SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM" TO THE "SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW" FORMS A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS. ALTHOUGH NATIONAL GOVERNANCE AND GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS FALL UNDER DISTINCT GOVERNANCE CATEGORIES AND LEGAL SYSTEMS, THEY ARE INTERCONNECTED, MUTUALLY INFLUENTIAL, AND INTEGRATED. AS A COMPONENT OF NATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN- RELATED AFFAIRS ACTS AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO INDEPENDENT LEGAL SYSTEMS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN NATIONAL AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO PROMOTE A HARMONIZED ADVANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN- RELATED AFFAIRS, THEREBY EXPEDITING THE STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN CONTEXTS. THIS STRATEGY MORE EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARDS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, SECURITY, AND DEVELOPMENTAL INTERESTS WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO BUILD A HUMAN COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE.
38	CHOICES THAT ARE UNDERDETERMINED BY REASON, SUCH AS CHOICES ARISING FROM INCOMMENSURABILITY AMONG VALUES, INVOLVE AN ELEMENT OF ARBITRARINESS, AND ARBITRARY CHOICES ARE COMMONLY THOUGHT TO BE INIMICAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT THE ARBITRARINESS OF SOME JUDICIAL CHOICES HAS DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE DIFFERENT IDEALS. ONE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS 'THE RULE OF AUTHORITY'; THE OTHER CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS 'THE RULE OF REASON'. THE LATTER IDEAL IS OPPOSED TO DECISIONS THAT LACK REASON, BUT NOT TO ARBITRARY CHOICES BETWEEN UNDEFEATED REASONS. THE ARBITRARINESS INVOLVED IN CHOOSING BETWEEN UNDEFEATED REASONS MAY BE A DEFICIT IN ONE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW (THE RULE OF AUTHORITY), BUT NOT A DEFICIT IN THE OTHER (THE RULE OF REASON). MOREOVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT THESE ARE DISTINCT IDEALS THAT CAN CONFLICT, AND NOT RIVAL INTERPRETATIONS OF A SINGLE IDEAL.
39	USING DATA FROM 41 COUNTRIES FOR THE 2013-2018 PERIOD, THE DEPENDENCE OF GDP GROWTH ON THE RULE OF LAW INDEX THAT IS CALCULATED BY THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. COMPARED TO OTHER SPECIALIZED INDICATORS FOR ASSESSING COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS THE WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATOR, THE INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY RISK GUIDE, OR THE INDEX OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, THE WJP DIFFERS MORE FULLY INTO ACTUAL LEGAL PRACTICE (NOT ONLY THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION) BY COMBINING EXPERT JUDGMENT WITH THE RESULTS OF QUESTIONNAIRES SURVEYS OF RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTRY. CROSS-REGRESSION ESTIMATES FOR THE 2013-2018 AVERAGES ARE QUITE CONTRADICTORY FOR THE GENERAL SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES, BUT A DIRECT DEPENDENCE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH ON THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN OBTAINED FOR THE COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. IF UKRAINE ROSE FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF THE WJP INDEX (0.50) TO THE LEVEL OF GEORGIA (0.61), IT ALLOWS TO INCREASE THE GDP GROWTH RATE BY 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS. ESTIMATES FOR PANEL DATA USING THE A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL (RE) CONFIRM THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ECO-ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR CEE AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, WHEREAS A WEAK INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO INDICATORS CAN BE OBSERVED IN ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IT IS ADVISABLE TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN TRANSFORMATIONAL ECONOMIES, WHILE THIS IS NOT URGENT MEASURES IN THE OTHER STUDIED COUNTRIES. THE OVERALL STUDY DOES NOT DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WITHOUT ADVANCING THE LEGAL FOUNDATIONS OR DEEPENING THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION OF POLITICAL LIFE, BUT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CEE COUNTRIES AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. IN THE EXTENDED SPECIFICATION OF THE REGRESSION MODEL, IT SEEMS THAT THE FAVORABLE INFLUENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ON GDP DYNAMICS FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL ECONOMIES CAN BE REALIZED BY SLOWING DOWN INFLATION. AT THE SAME TIME, NO DEPENDENCE OF INFLATION ON THE WJP HAS BEEN FOUND FOR ASIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES; THERE IS ALSO NO EFFECT OF CONSUMER PRICES ON ECONOMIC GROWTH. IT IS NOTICEABLE THAT ESTIMATES FOR THE GENERAL SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES SHOW THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ONLY HIGH INFLATION - OVER 15% PER ANNUM. AMONG OTHER RESULTS, THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INVESTMENT AND GDP GROWTH IS WORTH NOTING, REGARDLESS OF THE REGRESSION MODEL CHOSEN. THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE STANDARD ASSUMPTIONS OF ECONOMIC THEORY AND, ACCORDINGLY, REINFORCES THE ARGUMENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AS A MEANS OF STIMULATING THE INVESTMENT PROCESS.
40	IN THIS PAPER, WE PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE OF HOW HISTORICAL RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AFFECT THE RULE OF LAW. IN A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES FRAMEWORK, WE SHOW THAT DISTRICTS IN PAKISTAN WHERE THE HISTORICAL PRESENCE OF RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS IS HIGHER, RULE OF LAW IS WORSE. THIS DETERIORATION IS ECONOMICALLY SIGNIFICANT, PERSISTENT, AND LIKELY EXPLAINED BY RELIGIOUS LEADERS GAINING POLITICAL OFFICE. WE EXPLAIN THESE FINDINGS WITH A MODEL WHERE RELIGIOUS LEADERS LEVERAGE THEIR HIGH LEGITIMACY TO RUN FOR OFFICE AND SUBVERT THE COURTS. WE TEST FOR AND FIND NO EVIDENCE SUPPORTING SEVERAL COMPETING EXPLANATIONS: THE RISE OF SECULAR WEALTHY LANDOWNERS, DYNASTIC POLITICAL LEADERS AND CHANGES IN VOTER ATTITUDES ARE UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PATTERNS IN THE DATA. OUR ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT RELIGIOUS LEADERS EXPROPRIATE RENTS THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM AMOUNTING TO ABOUT 0.06 PERCENT OF GDP EVERY YEAR.
41	THE RESURGENCE OF POPULISM IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO HAVE PLACED THE RULE OF LAW UNDER PRESSURE. BUT HOW MANY OF THE RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE INDEED ASSOCIATED WITH POPULISM? AND IS ANY SUCH ASSOCIATION A CONTINGENT OR ANALYTIC MATTER: DOES POPULISM INEVITABLY THREATEN THE RULE OF LAW, OR DO OTHER CONDITIONS INTERVENE TO SHAPE ITS IMPACT? AFTER SETTING OUT HOW I UNDERSTAND THE RULE OF LAW AND POPULISM, I EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH CONTEMPORARY POPULIST DISCOURSE HAS CHALLENGED THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS-NOTABLY AGENDA SETTING, POLICY IMPACT, INFLUENCE ON DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS, AND CONVENTION TRASHING-CONSIDERING THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT CONDUCE TO STRENGTHEN OR WEAKEN THESE MECHANISMS IN PARTICULAR CONTEXTS. FINALLY, I CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS FOR CONTEMPORARY CRIMINALIZATION, ASSESSING HOW MANY OF THE FACTORS PRODUCING PENAL POPULISM OR OVERCRIMINALIZATION ARE TRULY A PRODUCT OF POPULISM.
42	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A COMPARATIVE REVIEW OF SEVEN RULE OF LAW MEASURES. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MEASURES DIFFER IN BOTH FORM AND APPROPRIATENESS AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS. THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE, AMONG OTHERS, RESTRICTIONS IN SCOPE AND AVAILABILITY OF DISAGGREGATE DATA, INSUFFICIENT CODEBOOKS, AND UNJUSTIFIED AGGREGATION PROCEDURES. IN MOST CASES, THE TASK OF CONCEPTUALIZATION IS NOT GROUNDED IN THEORY, AND KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE LEFT OUT WHILE MORE INAPPROPRIATE ELEMENTS ARE INCLUDED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MORE PRECAUTION IS REQUIRED IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT OF RULE OF LAW MEASURES.
43	RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE CONNECTED CATEGORIES. RULE OF LAW WOULD BE EMPTY DEFINITION WITHOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION CANNOT BE ENFORCED WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK. THE STRONG RULE OF LAW IS KEY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION. SOME OF HUMAN RIGHTS ARE DIRECTLY OVERLAPPING WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AS RIGHT FOR FAIR TRIAL OR FREEDOM OF SPEECH. THE PAPER IS FOCUSED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK ADOPTED ON INTERNATIONAL LEVEL INTO EUROPEAN LEVEL AND IT IS FOLLOWED BY COUNTRY ANALYSIS AS THE CASE STUDY TO VERIFY THE CONNECTION OF RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
44	THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THERE IS A RULE OF LAW RECESSION AMONG MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD). THIS FORMAL INQUIRY IS MOTIVATED BY THE RECENT FINDINGS OF A DEMOCRATIC RECESSION ACROSS SEVERAL COUNTRIES WITH A LONG TRADITION OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES. I CONDUCT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES USING THE RULE OF LAW INDEX FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT, AS WELL AS DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AND ACADEMIC REPORTS. RESULTS SHOW THAT, BY AND LARGE, THERE IS NO RULE OF LAW RECESSION AMONG OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT 12 OUT OF THE 28 OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES ANALYZED IN THIS PAPER CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR LEVEL OF ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW DURING THE PERIOD 2014-2020. IN FACT, JUST AS MANY OECD MEMBER COUNTRIES HAVE STABLE SCORES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE RULE OF LAW INDEX. IN CONTRAST, ONLY TURKEY, HUNGARY, KOREA, AND POLAND EXHIBIT A RULE OF LAW RECESSION.
45	IN THIS ESSAY, WE ATTEMPT TO LAY THE INITIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF RULE OF LAW BOTH AS A CONCEPT AND AS A DISTINCT FIELD. WE RESPOND TO THE ASSERTIONS THAT THE RULE OF LAW FIELD IS NON-EXISTENT OR INCOHERENT, AND ASSERT THAT A FIELD OF RULE OF LAW IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN. FIRST, WE SURVEY HOW RULE OF LAW - AS BOTH A TERM AND A STATE OF POLITICAL BEING - IS UNDERSTOOD BY PRACTITIONERS AND SCHOLARS, AS WELL AS HOW SCHOLARS RECONCILE THE LACK OF A CLEAR, WIDELY UNIVERSAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW. SECOND, WE PUT FORTH OUR APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW STUDIES, EMBODIED BY THE RULE OF LAW COLLABORATIVE (ROLC) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA. ROLC SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES AND FACTORS IMPACT THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE ACCOMMODATING THE MULTIPLE, COMPETING UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW THAT EXIST ON THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA CAMPUS AND ELSEWHERE.
46	IN THIS SHORT PAPER I PROVIDE A JUSTIFICATORY ARGUMENT FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENDEAVOUR EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PAPERS THAT COMPRISE THE REMAINDER OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. I SUGGEST THAT CONSIDERATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE ORIGINS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW NOT ONLY MATTERS, BUT ALSO THAT IT IS A PRACTICE THAT IS OFTEN NEGLECTED. FURTHER, I SUGGEST OUR FAILURE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGINS OF THE RULE OF LAW-BY CONTINUING TO SIMPLY INNOVATE AROUND THE IDEA OF THE CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT-LIMITS THE CONCEPT'S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND WILL, POTENTIALLY, NOT REFLECT FAITHFULLY THE IDEAS FROM WHICH OUR CONTEMPORARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT IS ULTIMATELY DERIVED. AS A RESULT OF THIS FAILURE, WE RISK THE (UNINTENTIONAL) IMPOSITION OF A SELECTIVE APPROACH IN THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FUTURE. INCREASING OUR FOCUS ON THE ORIGINS OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL NOT ONLY ILLUMINATE THE RATIONALE FOR AND BEHIND THE OPERATION OF THE CONCEPT, BUT IT WILL ALSO EXPOSE ASPECTS OF THE CONCEPT THAT ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED OR INCLUDED-IN CONTEMPORARY CONCEPTIONS OF THE IDEA-AND WILL ENSURE OUR FUTURE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT CURTAILED.
47	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS A COMMUNITY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. EU MEMBER STATES HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND TO RESPECT THE PRIMACY OF EU LAW. YET TODAY, THE EU LEGAL ORDER IS THREATENED BY THE EMERGENCE OF INCREASINGLY AUTOCRATIC MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, WHO ROUTINELY VIOLATE THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THE EU IS BASED. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES WHETHER THE MODEL OF DIFFERENTIATED INTEGRATION CAN BE APPLIED TO HELP THE EU ADDRESS THIS RULE OF LAW CRISIS. IN RECENT YEARS, MANY ANALYSTS HAVE CALLED ON THE EU TO EMBRACE A MODEL OF DIFFERENTIATED INTEGRATION AS A WAY TO ADDRESS ITS MANY CHALLENGES, AND SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT VERSIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION MIGHT HELP THE EU RESOLVE TENSIONS WITH ITS MEMBER STATES CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW. BY CONTRAST, THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE THAT DIFFERENTIATION IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE THEORY OF CONSTITUTIONAL PLURALISM THAT SOME USE TO JUSTIFY IT ARE NEITHER NORMATIVELY DESIRABLE NOR PRACTICALLY FEASIBLE MODELS. IN SHORT, WE MUST REJECT DIFFERENTIATED INTEGRATION WHEN IT COMES TO RULE OF LAW.
48	PALOMBELLA HAS OFFERED US NOT MERELY A STRONG CASE FOR ONE DISTINCTIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO A SUSTAINED DEMONSTRATION OF HOW TO THINK WELL ABOUT THESE MATTERS. THE SUBSTANCE OF HIS ACCOUNT IS THIS ARTICLE'S MAIN SUBJECT, BUT HIS METHODOLOGICAL EXAMPLE COULD USEFULLY BE EMULATED EVEN BY THOSE WHO MIGHT DRAW DIFFERENT SUBSTANTIVE CONCLUSIONS FROM SUCH CONSIDERATION. THE ARTICLE STARTS WITH SUBSTANCE (SIC 1), HIS "INSTITUTIONAL IDEA CONCERNING THE LAW" AND MOVES TO HIS METHOD (SIC 2), ONE THAT COMBINES ATTENTION TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW, ITS SPECIFIC HISTORICAL ORIGINS, AND POSSIBILITIES FOR ITS ELABORATION AND APPLICATION IN CONTEXTS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WHERE IT ORIGINATED. IT THEN ASKS THREE QUESTIONS: ONE ABOUT THE STATUS OF NON-ARBITRARINESS IN PALOMBELLA'S CONCEPTION (SIC3), A SECOND ABOUT THE POINT OR TELOS OF THE RULE OF LAW (SIC 4), AND A THIRD ABOUT ITS SOCIAL DIMENSIONS (SIC 5).
49	THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS IMPORT BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND SUPRA-STATE LEGALITIES, STARTING FROM PROBLEMS RAISED BY REAL CASES, AND THE INSUFFICIENCY OF SOME RECEIVED IDEAS OR MORE COMMON NOTIONS-FROM THOSE REQUISITES-BASED TO FORMAL, MATERIAL, OR PROCEDURAL ONES-TO COPE WITH THEM. ACCORDINGLY IT FOCUSES UPON A "DUAL" STRUCTURE OF LEGALITY AS AN INSTITUTIONAL CONDITION FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO PURSUE ITS NORMATIVE IDEAL. THE "DUALITY CONDITION" FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS HISTORICALLY AND THEORETICALLY RECONSTRUCTED IN ITS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE NOTION IS CAREFULLY DISTINGUISHED FROM RULE COMPLIANCE, PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS, SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE, THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, AND OTHER DIFFERENT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PRESENT LEGAL CIVILIZATION. ITS ESSENTIAL CONTENT SHAPES A SEPARATE, DISTINCT IDENTITY VIS A VIS DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, WHILE IT APPEARS CONDUCIVE TO THE APPRAISAL OF SEVERAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW OVERSIGHT IN DIVERSE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
50	THIS ARTICLE WILL SEEK TO OPERATIONALIZE AND MEASURE RULE OF LAW PRIMARILY RELYING ON THE "RULE OF LAW CHECKLIST," DEVELOPED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION, COMPOSED OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE ELEMENTS: (1) LEGALITY; (2) LEGAL CERTAINTY; (3) PREVENTION OF ABUSE OR MISUSE OF POWERS; (4) EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND NON-DISCRIMINATION; AND (5) ACCESS TO JUSTICE. EACH OF THESE ELEMENTS WILL BE OPERATIONALIZED IN THE CONTEXT OF KOSOVO - THE LEADING CASE STUDY - WITH AN ULTIMATE AIM OF OBTAINING AN ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK AND ITS MEASUREMENT IN TRANSITIONAL CONTEXTS MORE GENERALLY. THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE SELECTED CASE ARE DEFINED BY AN ALMOST UNPARALLELED INVOLVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, IN PARTICULAR THE UN AND THE EU, WHICH FORMS A RELATIVELY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE OBSERVABLE CONTEXT.
51	DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EUROPEAN UNION HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY A FOCUS ON RULE OF LAW INFRINGEMENTS BY PUBLIC ACTORS. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS SCHOLARS HAVE BEGUN EXPLORING THE RELEVANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW TO PRIVATE ACTORS. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS PIECE, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THAT, BECAUSE THE CORE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ABOUT LIMITING THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF POWER BY THOSE THAT POSSESS IT, AND BECAUSE PRIVATE ACTORS ARE INCREASINGLY ABLE TO HARM INDIVIDUALS THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF POWER IN WAYS SIMILAR TO PUBLIC ACTORS, OBLIGATIONS INSPIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE EXTENDED BY MEMBER STATES AND THE UNION TO PRIVATE ACTORS. AS WILL BE SEEN, VARIOUS AREAS OF UNION LAW ARE ALREADY UNDERPINNED BY IDEAS RELATED TO THE RESTRAINT OF THE EXERCISE OF ARBITRARY POWER BY PRIVATE ACTORS VIS-A-VIS INDIVIDUALS. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. THUS, FURTHER REFLECTION BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS WARRANTED IN ORDER TO TEMPER THE EXERCISE OF SUCH POWER.
52	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CHINA'S LEGAL REFORM AND ITS LATER ENDORSEMENT OF A SOCIALIST VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS A RATIONAL RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS OF POLITICAL LEGITIMACY, WITH THE AIM OF FACILITATING THE ECONOMIC REFORMS, ENHANCING GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, CURBING CORRUPTION, AND MAINTAINING SOCIAL STABILITY AND ONE-PARTY RULE. HOWEVER, SINCE SOCIALIST CHINA HAS BUILT ITS LEGITIMACY UPON ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE LAW REMAINS ONE OF AN ARRAY OF INSTRUMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THE REGIME. THUS, THE OFFICIALLY ENDORSED RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, FROM BOTH A THEORETICAL AND A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW, IS ACTUALLY A SOCIALIST RULE BY LAW, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE RULING PARTY HAS NEVER WANTED OR ADVOCATED, THROUGHOUT ITS REFORMS, A RULE OF LAW. WHAT IT WANTS IS AN EFFECTIVE AND AUTHORITARIAN LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WILL MEET ITS GOALS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT UNDERMINING ITS CONTROL OF THE STATE AND SOCIETY.
53	THE QUESTION OF WHETHER DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS FACILITATE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IS A CONTROVERSIAL ONE IN CURRENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF TERRORISM. ALTHOUGH THE "RULE OF LAW'' IS AN ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONAL PILLAR OF ANY MATURE DEMOCRACY, ITS DIRECT EFFECT ON DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM REMAINS UNEXPLORED. CONCEIVING DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW AS THE COEXISTENCE OF EFFECTIVE AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AND CITIZENS' RECOGNITION OF THE LAW AS LEGITIMATE, THE AUTHOR PRESENTS A CAUSAL EXPLANATION IN WHICH A HIGH-QUALITY RULE OF LAW IS CONSIDERED TO DAMPEN ORDINARY CITIZENS' OPPORTUNITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE, PROTECTING DEMOCRACIES FROM BECOMING VICTIMS OF TERRORISM. BUILT ON A CROSS-SECTIONAL, TIME-SERIES DATA ANALYSIS OF 131 COUNTRIES DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1984 TO 2004, THE AUTHOR FINDS THAT, CETERIS PARIBUS, MAINTAINING A SOUND RULE OF LAW NOTABLY REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY TYPE OF TERRORIST EVENTS. IN SHORT, THE RULE OF LAW INSTANTIATED IN DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDES A FORMIDABLE BULWARK AGAINST TERRORISM.
54	PALESTINE'S ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS, THE SULHA SYSTEM, IS UTILIZED IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DISPUTES. DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF THE SULHA PROCESS, THERE EXISTS, TO DATE, NO INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ASSESSMENT OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES PALESTINIAN SULHA'S ADHERENCE TO INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. USING RULE OF LAW THEORY TO ASSESS THE FAIRNESS, EQUITY, AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE SULHA SYSTEM, THIS ARTICLE DETERMINES THAT PALESTINIAN SULHA PROCEEDINGS SATISFY THE MAJOR REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW STANDARDS.
55	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHINA HAS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SUCH HIGH RATES OF GROWTH OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF A VERITABLE RULE OF LAW. A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT A STRONG RULE OF LAW IS A KEY PREREQUISITE FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BUT CHINA'S UNIQUE POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH VESTS LIMITED POWER IN ITS JUDICIARY SEEMS TO DEFY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ON THIS COUNT. TAKING AS A STARTING POINT YANG YAO'S CONCEPT OF DISINTERESTED GOVERNMENT', THAT IS, A GOVERNMENT THAT ESCHEWS DIFFERENTIATED INTERESTS WITHIN A SOCIETY IN FAVOUR OF A CONCERTED FOCUS ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CHINESE LEADERSHIP HAS MAINTAINED EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE RULE OF LAW. SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE DEFINING FEATURES OF A DISINTERESTED GOVERNMENT FULFIL MANY OF THE SAME ROLES AS THE RULE OF LAW FROM A DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE.
56	THE PAPER PROPOSES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF HOW THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN DIGNITY, UPHELD IN THE BRAZILIAN CONSTITUTION, HAS BEEN MISUSED IN SOME JUDICIAL DECISIONS, LEADING TO ARBITRARY SOLUTIONS THAT CONTRADICT THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
57	THE RULE OF LAW AND THE OTHER VALUES CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (ART 2 TEU) COMPRISE THE CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (UNION). THESE VALUES FORM PART OF THE UNION'S VERY FOUNDATION. ART 3(1) AND (6) TEU, IN CONJUNCTION WITH ART 2 TEU, DECLARE THE UNION'S AIM TO PROMOTE AND PURSUE THE RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF ITS CORE VALUES. THESE PROVISIONS INDICATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ONLY A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE BUT GIVES THE UNION A MANDATE TO SHAPE ITS POLICIES ACCORDINGLY IN ORDER TO CREATE AN ENABLING ECOSYSTEM FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES. THE UNION MAY COUNTER INTERNAL THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW, BUT IT CAN AND SHOULD ALSO TAKE POSITIVE LEGAL ACTION TO STRENGTHEN AND CONSOLIDATE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES BY MAKING USE OF ITS SECTORAL LAW-MAKING COMPETENCES. PROACTIVELY, THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE IMPLEMENTED AND SPECIFIED THROUGH UNION SECONDARY LAW AND MADE THE YARDSTICK FOR LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL ACTIVITY IN THE MEMBER STATES.
58	STUDYING THE IDEOLOGICAL ESSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW MEANS REALISING THAT THIS PRINCIPLE IS NOT A MERE FORMALISM. IT ALSO MEANS RECOGNISING THAT THE MATERIAL MEANING OF THIS PRINCIPLE IS TIED TO FUNDAMENTAL MORAL AND POLITICAL VALUES WHICH, WHILE ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS OF MODERN STATES, ARE PART OF A BROADER IDEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK THAT EXEMPLIFIES THE POLITICAL CONCEPTION OF THE POLITICAL COMMUNITY. IDEOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE DEFINED AS A NEGATIVE BURDEN ON A POLITICAL SPACE, BUT AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE FUNCTIONING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE POLITICAL. THE DETERMINATION OF HOW TO GOVERN IS A PRODUCT OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS, AND IN THIS SENSE THE RULE OF LAW HAS ITS OWN IDEOLOGICAL ESSENCE IN CLASSICAL LIBERALISM, WHICH HISTORICALLY DERIVES FROM THE VALUES OF LIBERTY AND FORMAL EQUALITY THAT THIS POLITICAL IDEOLOGY BRINGS TO BEAR AGAINST FEUDALISM AND ABSOLUTISM. IN THE NAME OF THESE VALUES, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW EMERGES AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR LIMITING THE CENTRAL POWER OF THE STATE IN THE MODERN STATE, WHICH IS ONLY STIMULATED BY A SET OF POLITICAL RELATIONS THAT HAVE TILTED TOWARDS THE SIDE OF THE LIBERAL BOURGEOISIE IN THE POLITICAL BATTLE WITH THE FEUDAL ARISTOCRACY.
59	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE FAILURES IN THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SIX COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN BALKANS THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF THEIR EU ACCESSION PROCESS. DRAWING ON CONCRETE EXAMPLES FROM MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION THROUGH THE ENLARGEMENT CIRCLES, THE PAPER IDENTIFIES THE DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY STAGES OF THIS UNDERTAKING. IT FINDS THAT THE CURRENT DOMINANT PARADIGM OF RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY CONCERNING THE BENCHMARKING OF PROGRESS IN THE AREAS OF CHAPTERS 23 AND 24 OF THE ACQUIS FAILS TO TACKLE STATE CAPTURE AS THE MAIN STRUCTURAL OBSTACLE TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE PAPER PROPOSES THAT THIS SITUATION IS TO BE IMPROVED BY RE-IMAGINING RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AS AN EFFORT FOCUSED NOT MERELY ON STANDARDS BUT ON BUILDING A RULE OF LAW CONSTITUENCY. FOUR DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO RULE OF LAW PROMOTION THAT HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENTLY USED SO FAR ARE OFFERED: LEGAL MOBILISATION, INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING, THE POLITICISATION OF ANTI-CORRUPTION, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH REFLECTIONS ON THE REALISTIC REACH OF THE PROPOSED INTERVENTIONS INTO EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, ARGUING THAT WHILE IMPERFECT THEY REMAIN NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THE PROJECT TO SUCCEED.
60	WE PROPOSE A NEW DE FACTO INDICATOR FOR THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS THE FIRST SUCH INDICATOR TO TAKE THE QUALITY OF LEGAL NORMS EXPLICITLY INTO ACCOUNT AND NOT ONLY THEIR ENFORCEMENT. USING THIS INDICATOR, WE INVESTIGATE THE DEEP ROOTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IN LINE WITH THE THEORETICAL LITERATURE ON LONG-RUN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, SPECIFIC DETERMINANTS OF LONG-RUN DEVELOPMENT (SUCH AS COLONIZATION EVENTS AND STRATEGIES) OPERATE VIA THE RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS OTHERS (SUCH AS THE TIMING OF EARLY STATE FORMATION AND THE TRANSITION FROM HUNTER-GATHERER TO AGRARIAN SOCIETIES) ARE NOT RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW. WE INTERPRET THIS EVIDENCE AS SUPPORTIVE OF THE ESTABLISHED NOTION IN THE LITERATURE THAT INSTITUTIONS MATTER FOR DEVELOPMENT.
61	THE RULE OF LAW MEANS THE GOVERNMENT MUST OPERATE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW IS SIGNIFICANT FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THIS REASON, ALL STATES NEED TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT IN THEIR GOVERNMENTS. MUSLIM STATES MAY NEED MOTIVATION FROM THE RELIGION ITSELF, AND IN ORDER TO CATER TO THIS NEED, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON THE ISLAMIC SOURCES OF REFERENCE, INCLUDING VERSES OF THE QUR'AN, THE PRACTICE AND SAYING OF PROPHET MU.AMMAD (S.A.W.), AND THE PRACTICE OF HIS RIGHTLY GUIDED CALIPHS. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EMBEDDED IN ISLAM, THOUGH SOME OF ITS PROVISIONS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MAY NOT BE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTABLE.
62	WELL-FUNCTIONING INSTITUTIONS, BOTH FORMAL (I.E. RULE OF LAW) AND INFORMAL (I.E. TRUST), FACILITATE ECONOMIC EXCHANGE. TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, WE ANALYZE BILATERAL TRADE PATTERNS IN A SAMPLE OF 16 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996-2009. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT TRUST AND RULE OF LAW ARE SUBSTITUTES, AS THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF TRUST ON TRADE IS CONDITIONAL ON THE QUALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW. WHEN THE RULE OF LAW OF THE IMPORTING COUNTRY INCREASES RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE EXPORTER, THE EFFECT OF TRUST ON TRADE DECREASES. THE DECLINE IN THE EFFECT OF TRUST ON TRADE IS LESS FOR IMPORTERS THAN FOR EXPORTERS, A RESULT THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK OF NON-PAYMENT THAT EXPORTERS RUN. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V.

63	CONTEMPORARY MONETARY SYSTEMS PERMIT THOSE IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE DISCRETIONARY POWER IN THE PURSUIT OF MONETARY POLICY OBJECTIVES. WE ARGUE THERE ARE STRONG PRIMA FACIE REASONS WHY THIS IS NORMATIVELY PROBLEMATIC. ENGAGING THE LITERATURE ON THE RULE OF LAW, WE ARGUE THAT A GENERAL AND NONDISCRIMINATORY RULE OUGHT TO APPLY TO MONETARY INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SAME REASONS SUCH A RULE OUGHT TO APPLY TO OTHER IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS PRIMA FACIE CASE MAY BE OVERCOME BY SUFFICIENTLY STRONG CONSEQUENTIALIST CONCERNS, BUT SHOW THAT THESE CONCERNS ARE UNGROUNDED: DISCRETIONARY MONETARY AUTHORITIES, BOTH IN THEORY AND PRACTICE, PERFORM POORLY. WE THUS AFFIRM THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR MONETARY POLICY AS A REQUISITE FOR BOTH NON-ARBITRARY GOVERNANCE AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY.
64	"REVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW": TRANSITIONAL RULE OF LAW IN POST-COMMUNIST ROMANIA. THE PRESENT STUDY SEEKS TO THEORIZE UPON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN POST-COMMUNIST ROMANIA. THE PHRASE "TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE" IS ESSENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD AS THE AMOUNT OF PRACTICES RESULTING FROM THE CONTEXTUALIZING OF THE MECHANISMS OF JUSTICE TO A CERTAIN HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE PRESSURES OF THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN POST-TOTALITARIAN NEWLY EMERGED DEMOCRACIES SHAPE THE RULE OF LAW IN CERTAIN WAYS, DIFFERING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. THE POLITICAL AND HISTORICAL ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO BEING SHAPED BY THE DECISIONS OF THE JUDICIARY. IN ESSENCE, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE QUESTIONS IN A CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER ALL THE JUDICIAL PRACTICES OF A CERTAIN POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE VERY NORMATIVITY OF THE CONTINGENT POLITICAL ORDER. ROMANIA'S STATUS IN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LARGER EASTERN EUROPEAN TRANSITION FROM TOTALITARIANISM TO DEMOCRACY. ALTHOUGH ROMANIAN TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE MAINSTREAM REGIONAL EFFORTS TO ADJUST TO A NEW LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, THERE ARE STILL SOME PECULIARITIES WHICH DEFINE ROMANIA'S PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT ADVANCEMENT FROM COMMUNISM TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
65	THE RULE OF LAW MEANS THE GOVERNMENT MUST OPERATE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW IS SIGNIFICANT FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. FOR THIS REASON, ALL STATES NEED TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT IN THEIR GOVERNMENTS. MUSLIM STATES MAY NEED MOTIVATION FROM THE RELIGION ITSELF, AND IN ORDER TO CATER TO THIS NEED, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON THE ISLAMIC SOURCES OF REFERENCE, INCLUDING VERSES OF THE QUR'AN, THE PRACTICE AND SAYING OF PROPHET MUHAMMAD (S.A.W.), AND THE PRACTICE OF HIS RIGHTLY GUIDED CALIPHS. THIS ARTICLE FINDS THAT THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EMBEDDED IN ISLAM, THOUGH SOME OF ITS PROVISIONS ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS MAY NOT BE UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTABLE.
66	THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND THE RULE OF LAW IN EMERGING DEMOCRACIES. THE AUTHORS PROVIDE A FORMAL LOGIC TO THE MADISONIAN ASSERTION THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS STRENGTHENS THE RULE OF LAW. THE MODEL SHOWS THAT AS THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS IN GOVERNMENT INCREASES, THEIR ABILITY TO COLLUDE ON ACCEPTING BRIBES DECREASES; THEREFORE, THEIR INCENTIVE TO VOTE ON LEGISLATION STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW INCREASES. THE AUTHORS CLASSIFY GOVERNMENTS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS, FOLLOWING THE LOGIC PROPOSED BY TSEBELIS. THE AUTHORS TEST HYPOTHESES DERIVED FROM THEIR MODEL ON 35 EMERGING DEMOCRACIES USING VETO-PLAYER DATA THAT THEY GATHERED FOR THE ANALYSES. THE AUTHORS FIND THAT SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE VETO PLAYERS HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, INDEPENDENT OF THE NUMBER OF VETO PLAYERS, PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW THAN DO PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS.
67	"SOCIETY WITH RULE OF LAW" IS A CONCEPT STRONGLY MARKED BY THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF CHINESE PRACTICE. IT REFERS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF "RULE OF LAW" IN THE LIFE OF SOCIETY OVER AND ABOVE THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF PUBLIC POWER. LIKE A COUNTRY WITH RULE OF LAW AND A GOVERNMENT WITH RULE OF LAW, A SOCIETY WITH RULE OF LAW HAS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT SPHERE, CONSTITUTING THE "ONE BODY, TWO WINGS" OF CHINESE RULE OF LAW. THE CONCRETE CONTEXT OF A COUNTRY'S ABILITY TO MOBILIZE, ITS EXISTING LEGAL SYSTEM, THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIAL GOVERNANCE, THE STATE OF SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS, ETC., MAY ENCOURAGE OR LIMIT THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIETY WITH RULE OF LAW. SUCH CONSTRUCTION SHOULD HAVE STRONGLY IDENTIFIABLE TARGET GUIDELINES: IT SHOULD GUIDE ORDERLY PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNANCE OF SOCIETY, MAINTAIN GOOD ORDER IN MATERIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE, CALIBRATE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR BASIC PUBLIC SERVICES, AND DEFINE THE PROPER SPACE FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THE COMMUNITY LEVEL IS THE MAIN FIELD FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIETY WITH RULE OF LAW. WE SHOULD CONFRONT GRASSROOTS CONSTRAINTS, FOCUS ON THE MAIN BUSINESS OF GRASSROOTS SOCIETY, AND MAKE FULL USE OF THE FUNCTION OF GRASSROOTS SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE THE IMPORTANT ROLES OF GOVERNMENT, SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, LAWYERS AND OTHER PLAYERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOCIETY WITH RULE OF LAW.
68	THE USE OF ARTICLE 7 TEU AGAINST POLAND AND HUNGARY HAS BEEN GENERALLY WELCOMED WITH RELIEF PROVING THAT, AT LAST, THE EU IS READY TO DEFEND ARTICLE 2 TEU VALUES WHEN MEMBER STATES OPENLY VIOLATE THEM. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR YET WHAT THE MAIN VALUE THAT IS CLAIMED TO BE BREACHED - THE RULE OF LAW - AMOUNTS TO IN THE EU. ACTUALLY, THE RESORT TO ARTICLE 7 TEU CROWNS A PROCESS OF EQUIPPING THE EU WITH A RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK TO COMBAT MEMBER STATES' FAILURES IN BOTH LAW MAKING AND ENFORCEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE LAW'S CONTENT AND PROVENANCE. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EU RULE OF LAW IS ANCHORED TO A 'THIN' CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE IDEAL AND THAT THE EU IS MOVING FROM A MERE RULE OF EU LAW TOWARDS A MORE SOPHISTICATED EU RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE. THIS PROCESS IS, AT THE SAME TIME, ENLARGING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER AND REAFFIRMING THE UNION CHARACTER - AND NOT UNITY ONLY - OF EU INTEGRATION THROUGH LAW.
69	INTERSECTIONALITY IS A COMMONLY USED PERSPECTIVE IN ISSUES REGARDING SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND INJUSTICE IN SEVERAL FIELDS, AND HAS ALSO BEEN INTRODUCED IN DISABILITY STUDIES. IN LEGAL SYSTEMS, SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND RULE OF LAW ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED. THE COURT IS AN ARENA THAT IS KNOWN BOTH TO PRODUCE AND REPRODUCE SOCIAL INEQUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO RAISE AND DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF HOW INTERSECTIONALITY MAY SERVE AS A PRODUCTIVE THEORETICAL APPROACH IN RESEARCH ON DISABILITY AND RULE OF LAW. WE DISCUSS IN WHAT WAYS INTERSECTIONALITY AS A PERSPECTIVE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO RULE OF LAW FOR DISABLED PEOPLE IN WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS. OUR INTENTION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF INTERSECTIONALITY AS A SENSITIZING PERSPECTIVE WITHIN A PROCESS-ORIENTED MODEL FOR ANALYTICAL SENSIBILITY. INTERSECTIONALITY AS A PERSPECTIVE IN RELATION TO DISABILITY AND RULE OF LAW IS EXPLORED WITH CATEGORIZATION AND GENDER IN FOCUS.
70	WHILE THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, THE ANALYSIS OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL INSTRUMENTS, STATEMENTS MADE BY STATES, AND NEGOTIATION RECORDS, INDICATES THAT WITHIN THE UN THE RULE OF LAW HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY CONTESTED IN THE PAST YEARS, CULMINATING AT THE POST-2015 PROCESS LEADING TO THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). THIS RESEARCH ARTICLE, FIRST, SETS OUT THE BACKGROUND OF THE RULE OF LAW DEBATE AT THE UN, FOLLOWED BY ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS IN THE 2030 AGENDA, AND FINALLY, EXPLORES WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS A UNIVERSAL CONCEPT THAT CARRIES NORMATIVE AUTHORITY, IN PARTICULAR WITHIN THE SDGS FRAMEWORK. REFLECTIONS DRAWN FROM THE POST-2015 PROCESS ILLUSTRATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW - OR AT LEAST THE "THICK'' UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT - IS IN DECLINE IN INSTITUTIONAL AND NORMATIVE CONTEXTS. SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE BROADENING OF THE RULE OF LAW - WITH MORE SUBSTANCE AND INTERPRETATIONS ATTACHED TO IT - ITS NORMATIVE SPECIFICITY IS BEING DILUTED, WHICH CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND DISAGREEMENT AMONG STATES ON ITS CORE CONTENT. THIS CONCEPTUAL WEAKNESS IMPACTS ALSO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS IN THE 2030 AGENDA, AND CAN BE PERCEIVED AS SYMPTOMATIC OF A BROADER CRISIS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER.
71	SIMPLE SUMMARY ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION IS ROUTINELY UNDERENFORCED BY THE STATE. THIS UNDERENFORCEMENT HAS OBVIOUS AND DIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ANIMAL VICTIMS OF CRUELTY AND NEGLECT. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT THERE ARE ALSO LESS OBVIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH UNDERENFORCEMENT: IT UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE CONSTRUCTS THIS ARGUMENT FROM A REVIEW OF RULE OF LAW LITERATURE AND INVESTIGATES THE IMPLICATIONS OF UNDERENFORCEMENT BEING A CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM. MANY HAVE DECRIED THE STATE'S UNDERENFORCEMENT OF ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THE DIRECT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON ANIMAL INTERESTS. THIS ARTICLE WILL ADVANCE THE ARGUMENT THAT SUCH UNDERENFORCEMENT HAS A MUCH DEEPER SOCIETAL EFFECT BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW. IT DOES SO BY FIRST, REVIEWING RULE OF LAW LITERATURE TO ADVANCE THE PROPOSITION THAT THE STATE HAS A GENERAL OBLIGATION TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND, SPECIFICALLY, ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION. IT THEN LOOKS TO THE PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT ARISE WITH THE ARGUMENT, SPECIFICALLY PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION AND PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS. FINALLY, IT CONCLUDES THAT THE STATE'S UNDERENFORCEMENT OF ANIMAL WELFARE LEGISLATION DOES INDEED RUN CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND THUS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE HAVE THE INTERESTS OF ANIMALS AT THE FRONT OF OUR MINDS, IT IS A MATTER THAT SHOULD CONCERN US ALL.
72	THE 18TH CONGRESS OF CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY IN 2012 AND TWO IMPORTANT DECISIONS ADOPTED SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE 3RD AND 4TH PLENUM IN 2013 AND 2014 RESPECTIVELY, OPENED NEW PROSPECTS FOR CHINA'S REFORM GENERALLY AND THE LEGAL REFORM SPECIFICALLY. IN COMMENTING ON RANDALL PEERENBOOM'S ARTICLE, 'FLY HIGH THE BANNER OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS! WHAT DOES THE 4TH PLENUM DECISION MEAN FOR LEGAL REFORMS IN CHINA?', THIS COMMENTARY PAPER DISCUSSES THE TIMING OF THE DECISION ADOPTED AT THE 4TH PLENUM AND THE REASON WHY IT WAS DEVOTED TO THE ISSUE OF RULE OF LAW, THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE DECISION, THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORM AGENDA, THE SIGNIFICANCE AS WELL AS IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISION FOR CHINA'S LEGAL REFORM, AND THE PROSPECT OF DEVELOPING SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IN THE 21TH CENTURY CHINA.
73	THIS WORK AIMS TO STUDY FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL THEORIZATIONS LINKED TO THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW IN THE SCOPE OF THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN LAW AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. RESULTS: I) DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MAINLY CHALLENGE THE THEORETICAL NOTIONS OF TERRITORIALITY AND PERSONALITY, FUNDAMENTAL TO MODERN LAW - AND WITH THAT, THEORETICAL NOTIONS ABOUT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS SHOULD BE REVIEWED IN RELATION TO THE EXISTENCE OF AUTONOMOUS NON-HUMAN BEINGS; II) THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS BASED, AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT NOTIONS, ON LEGALITY AND DUE PROCESS, WILL ALSO HAVE TO BE RETHOUGHT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERSECTION OF LAW AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, SINCE THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES CARRIED OUT BY AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS HAVE A NATURE THAT CHALLENGES TRADITIONAL LEGAL ARGUMENTATIVE LOGIC AND TRANSPARENCY. METHODOLOGY: HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD OF PROCEDURE, WITH QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC-DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH TECHNIQUE.
74	CAMBODIAN LEADERS HAVE CONFOUNDED THE EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PROMOTE RULE OF LAW. OVER THE PAST DECADE THE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED A SERIES OF LEGAL REFORMS AND OVERSEEN AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING DEFAMATION LAWSUITS AGAINST OPPOSITION POLITICIANS AND MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY. THESE REFORMS AND PRACTICES, AS WELL AS THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY IN RELATION TO EACH, MAY BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD THROUGH ELITE PERCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CAMBODIA. COMPREHENDING THE RULE OF LAW AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD BY THE RULING ELITES OFFERS BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE TRAJECTORY OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE OBSTACLES TO WESTERN IDEALS FOR LEGAL REFORM. THIS ARTICLE SITUATES CAMBODIA WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND EXAMINES HOW A THIN RULE OF LAW HAS EVOLVED, FOCUSING ON DEFAMATION LAW AS A LEGAL AND POLITICAL STRATEGY OF CONTROL. WHILE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS PRESSED CAMBODIA TO CARRY OUT LIBERAL LEGAL REFORMS FOR SOME TIME, THE ARTICLE WILL OUTLINE THE OBSTACLES FACING REFORMERS AND THE COMPETING DESIRES OF CAMBODIAN LEADERS EMBEDDED IN THE PATRONAGE BASED POLITICAL ORDER.
75	DURING THE LATEST DECADE, EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS EXPANDED AND, IN THE PROCESS, BECOME EXTREMELY INFLUENTIAL. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT A NUMBER OF WIDELY USED INDICES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. THIS LACK OF INTERCHANGEABILITY IS REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT THEY ARE BASED ON DIFFERENT DEFINING ATTRIBUTES, TO SOME EXTENT COVER DISTINCT EMPIRICAL SCOPES, DO NOT CORRELATE HIGHLY WITH EACH OTHER, AND SUPPORT DIFFERENT EXPLANATORY FACTORS. UNTIL A CONSENSUS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, SCHOLARS ARE THUS NOT FREE TO OPT FOR THE MEASURE THAT FITS THEIR DATA REQUIREMENTS BEST REGARDING SPATIAL AND/OR TEMPORAL SCOPE. INSTEAD, THEY MUST CAREFULLY ASSESS THE CONTENT VALIDITY VIS-A-VIS THEIR STIPULATED DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND TIME POURED INTO THE RULE OF LAW AGENDA, THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED REFLECT THE LACK OF MATURITY OF 'GOOD GOVERNANCE' RESEARCH.
76	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY THAT IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW. ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES AND AFGHAN LEGAL TRADITIONS COMPLICATES THE ALREADY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW, HUMAN RIGHTS AND IMPUNITY. THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME PRINCIPLE, THE FREEDOM TO LIVE IN DIGNITY. THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS THEREFORE HAVE AN INDIVISIBLE AND INTRINSIC RELATIONSHIP. THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT'S PROMOTION OF IMPUNITY, FOR WARLORDS AND OTHERS ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES, HAMPERS THE ADVANCEMENT OF RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE PATH OF REFORMS IN THE AREA OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW IN AFGHANISTAN.
77	IN THE REALM OF THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS TAKING PLACE IN SEVERAL MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS ATTEMPT TO DILUTE INSTITUTIONAL AND NON-INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES WITH THE AIM TO UNRESTRAINEDLY EXERCISE THE STATE POWER. IN THIS CONTEXT, CIVIL SOCIETY, A SPHERE AUTONOMOUS FROM THE STATE WHERE PUBLIC INTERESTS ARE BEING EXPRESSED AND FORMULATED, IS CONSTANTLY UNDERMINED. THIS ARTICLE TRIES TO ILLUSTRATE THE RELATION BETWEEN CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS BACKSLIDING. IN THIS REGARD, A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK INDICATING THE CONNECTIONS OF THE DOMINANT CIVIL SOCIETY THEORIES WITH CORE RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS WILL BE DEVELOPED AND THE POINTS OF FRICTION WITH RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING WILL BE INDICATED. THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WILL, THEN, BE TESTED IN EU INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE THROUGH THE EXAMPLES OF THE EU ANNUAL RULE OF LAW REPORT AND THE CASE COMMISSION V. HUNGARY (TRANSPARENCY OF ASSOCIATIONS, C-78/18).
78	LAW AND ECONOMICS IS A SIGNIFICANT FIELD OF ANALYSIS IN LEGAL STUDIES AND IN ECONOMICS, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIES ABOUT HOW BEST TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND THE REGULATORY ROLE OF LAW. RATHER THAN SURVEYING THIS FIELD AND OFFERING A CRITICISM OF VARIOUS THEORIES AND ENGAGING IN THE DISPUTE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO, IN THIS ARTICLE I TAKE AN APPROACH ROOTED IN NEITHER MAINSTREAM ECONOMICS NOR IN FORMAL LEGAL PHILOSOPHY. RATHER DRAWING ON A RECENT WELL-ROUNDED STATEMENT OF BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS AND A SYNTHESIS OF PREVIOUS WORK ON THE NARRATIVE OF THE RULE OF LAW, I SEEK TO EXPLORE HOW AND WHY CONTEMPORARY CAPITALISM SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME SO TIED UP WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND WHAT THIS MIGHT TELL US MORE GENERALLY ABOUT THE ROLE OF LAW IN MARKET RELATIONS. THIS ANALYSIS GOES BEYOND THE RELATIVELY COMMONPLACE OBSERVATION THAT CAPITALISM REQUIRES PROPERTY RIGHTS, CONTRACT LAW AND MARKET INSTITUTIONALISATION TO FUNCTION, TO ASK WHAT EXACTLY IS IT ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW THAT SEEMS SO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING MARKET EXCHANGE(S)?'
79	THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE "LONGER TIME HORIZON" ARGUMENT PROPOSED BY POTRAFKE (ECON LETT,2012. 10.1016/J.ECONLET.2019.02.026) WITH REGARD TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF A HIGHER NATIONAL AVERAGE COGNITIVE ABILITY ON CORRUPTION HOLDS ONLY FOR COUNTRIES WITH A RELATIVELY HIGH QUALITY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. USING A SAMPLE OF 94 COUNTRIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD, OUR CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOW THE MODERATING ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN THE FINAL EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE ABILITIES ON CORRUPTION. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST AFTER USING DIFFERENT INDICATORS OF CORRUPTION, RULE OF LAW AND COGNITIVE SKILLS.
80	DUE TO THE INCOMPLETE LEGAL FOUNDATION FOR COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE, WHICH LEADS TO A SET OF PROBLEMS, IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO PROMOTE THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. PROMOTING THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK STARTS BY ENHANCING 'THE RULE OF LAW' IN COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE. THIS CONCEPTUAL PAPER PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE. THE ENHANCEMENT OF FOUR IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN KEY ARENAS OF POWER IN A COLLABORATION IS DISCUSSED. THESE FOUR PRINCIPLES INCLUDE PREDICTABILITY OF THE LAW, ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LAW, SUPREMACY OF THE LAW, AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. SIMILARLY, THE ARENAS OF POWER IN A COLLABORATION INCLUDE PARTICIPANT SELECTION IN THE ANTECEDENT PHASE OF COLLABORATION, PROCESS DESIGN AND CONTENT SELECTION IN THE PROCESS PHASE OF COLLABORATION, AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT IN THE OUTCOME PHASE OF COLLABORATION. THIS FRAMEWORK WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MANAGEMENT OF POWER RELATIONSHIPS IN COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE.
81	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE OFTEN-AFFIRMED LINK BETWEEN ACCESS TO JUSTICE (ATOJ) AND THE RULE OF LAW. SECTION 2 OFFERS AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT WE MEAN BY ATOJ, ARGUING THAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE ACCOUNT OF THAT IDEA HAS THREE COMPONENTS. SECTION 3 EXAMINES THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE CONCEPT AND CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ARGUES THAT THERE IS A PLAUSIBLE AND WIDELY SHARED CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT SHOWS THAT, ON THAT CORE SENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THERE ARE CONNECTIONS, SOME MORE DIRECT THAN OTHERS, BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND ATOJ. SECTION 4 ARGUES THAT OTHER ALLEGED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND ATOJ ARE NOT MADE OUT. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT WE SHOULD BE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THE ASSUMED LINK BETWEEN ATOJ AND THE RULE OF LAW, SINCE IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS TOO GLIBLY AND QUICKLY ASSERTED.
82	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR EGYPT AFTER MUBARAK. IN EGYPT, THE PROCESS OF WRITING AND RATIFYING A NEW CONSTITUTION WAS OVERSEEN FIRST BY SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF), THEN BY THE NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT MORSI AND BY SCAF AGAIN, WHEN THE ARMY MOVED TO DEPOSE MR MORSI AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PARTY. THE WRITING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONSTITUTION HAS UNDERGONE SEVERAL ITERATIONS SINCE 2011, EACH TIME SLANTED TOWARDS THE INTERESTS OF THOSE IN POWER. THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ANY COUNTRY MUST FIRST BE SECURED IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK WHICH SHOULD GUARANTEE THAT EVERYONE IS EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW AND THAT NO PERSON OR GROUP HAS A PRIVILEGED STATUS. DOES THE LATEST EGYPTIAN CONSTITUTION MEET THIS MOST BASIC OF CRITERION OF THE RULE OF LAW?
83	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELEVANCE FOR THE PRESENTE TIME OF THE NOTION OF BIOPOLITICS, WHICH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION IS CARRIED OUT BY FOUCAULT IN 1976, IN THE BOOK LA VOLONTE DE SAVOIRE AND IN THE COURSE IL FAUT DEFENDRE LA SOCIETE. THEREFORE, TAKE THE PROBLEM OF "IMMIGRATION CRISIS" IN RECENT YEARS, UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF BIOPOLITICS IN ONE OF ITS EXTREME ACHIEVEMENTS, IN THAT IT REVEALS THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE LEGAL-STATE AREA, THE DISCIPLINARY MECHANISMS OF THE BODY AND SECURITY MECHANISMS OF THE POPULATIONS. FROM THIS EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE ARGUE ABOUT THE LIMITS OF THE RULE OF LAW, ONE OF THE LEGAL-POLITICAL CATEGORIES WHICH CONSTITUTED A PARADIGM OF MODERN WESTERN POLITICS AND THAT IS FACED IN OUR TIME WITH THE EFFECTS OF THE BIOPOLITICS.
84	THE CORRUPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN AMBIGUOUS PHRASE. IT CAN REFER EITHER TO THE CORRUPTION OF THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW OR TO THE CORRUPTING EFFECT THAT THE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW PRODUCES. THIS ESSAY EXPLAINS HOW BOTH CAN BE THE CASE. THE RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF A CLUSTER OF VALUES THAT LIBERAL POLITICAL THEORY REQUIRES A MORALLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT TO EXEMPLIFY. THUS, THE RULE OF LAW IS A COMPONENT PART OF A JUST POLITICAL STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE PHRASE "THE RULE OF LAW" IS OFTEN USED COLLOQUIALLY TO REFER TO MOST OR ALL OF THE CLUSTER OF LIBERAL VALUES. WHEN USED IN THIS WAY, A DUTY TO OBEY THE LAW OFTEN ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS THE ASSOCIATION OF THIS DUTY WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW WHEN USED IN ITS NARROW, LITERAL SENSE TO REFER TO ONLY ONE OF THE LIBERAL VALUES THAT CORRUPTS BOTH THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RESPECT FOR THE VALUE ITSELF.
85	THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ENLARGEMENT. THREE MAIN ARGUMENTS ARE ADVANCED. FIRST, REGARDING THE COMMISSION'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PRE-ACCESSION PROCESS, IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT IT PREDOMINANTLY CONCENTRATES ON LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL REFORM. THE ARTICLE ASSERTS THAT, ALTHOUGH IMPORTANT, THIS PARTICULAR FOCUS FAILS TO RECOGNISE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE FUNCTIONING OF THE (BROADER) LEGAL SECTOR, AND THE APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LAW PER SE, BUT ALSO ABOUT FORMAL RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS ABOUT SOCIETAL ORIENTATION TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE WILL TO RESPECT IT. SECONDLY, IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT THE EU'S PRE-ACCESSION PROCESS DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE RULE OF LAW'S CORE FORMAL ELEMENTS, TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS MAIN FOCUS IS ALIGNMENT WITH THE ACQUIS AND CHANGES MADE TO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION ARE MEASURED IN TERMS OF QUANTITY AND NOT QUALITY. THIRDLY, ALTHOUGH THE RECENT ENLARGEMENT STRATEGIES AND MONITORING REPORTS INCREASINGLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO TAKE ROOT IN THE APPLICANT STATES, IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS SOFT RULE OF LAW ELEMENT HAS NOT (YET) BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE COMMISSION'S UNDERSTANDING OF AND APPROACH TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW.
86	THE RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE VERY POLEMICAL AND CONTROVERSIAL CONCEPTS IN THE FIELD OF PUBLIC LAW AND POLITICAL THOUGHTS. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN ACCLAIMED IN BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEVEL AND CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE PRACTICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS AND MANY OF STATES PRACTICALLY. IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE MEANTIME RULING BY LAW CAN BE STRENGTHENED AND ALSO SECURITY AND PEACE, DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS CAN BE PROTECTED AND PROMOTED. THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS TWO CONCEPTS WITH MUTUALLY INTERACTING TO EACH OTHER HAS NOTEWORTHY GREAT IMPORTANCE. AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIARY SUCH AS LINKAGE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN STRENGTHENING BOTH OF THEM. HUMAN RIGHTS, SEPARATION OF POWERS AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE ARE REGARDED AS SOME BASIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND AS WELL AS ITS CONSEQUENCE. THUS, IN THIS REGARD RULE OF LAW HAS P VERY GUIDELINES AND INDICATORS WHICH SOME OF THEM RELATED TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF STATES. IN THE LIGHT OF EXERCISE OF THESE GUIDELINES HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BETTER PROTECTED AND PROMOTED. THESE INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDELINES GENERALLY ARE PROVIDED IN INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS TO ENFORCE IN EVERY SECTOR OF THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY FOR JUDGES AND JUDICIAL POWER TO PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO INTRODUCE SOME MEASURES AND INDICATORS OF THE RULE OF LAW TO ENFORCE THEM IN THE JUDICIARY FOR BETTER PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.
87	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON WHAT THE RULE OF LAW REALLY MEANS IN POLAND'S POST-SOCIALIST TRANSITION. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE, WE FOCUS ON THE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE OF MAJORITY RULE. WE HIGHLIGHT TWO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT STEM FROM THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE CONCEPTS OF FREEDOM. IN THE SECOND PART, WE LOOK FOR THE CAUSES BEHIND THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN POLAND. REFERRING TO THE COURSE OF POLAND'S POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TRANSITION, WE REFER TO THE DISPUTES AROUND THE BALCEROWICZ PLAN AS WELL AS THE TENDENCY TO INTERPRET THE RULE OF LAW IN LIGHT OF THE POSITIVE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM. WE ALSO MENTION THE CONFRONTATIONAL STYLE OF THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE AND THE PROCESS OF "LEGISLATIVE INFLATION." THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND THE THESIS THAT UNDERMINING THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS NOT THE WAY TO RECTIFY FAULTS IN THE SOCIAL SYSTEM, BUT IT MAY DEEPEN THE "LEGISLATIVE INFLATION" PROCESS, TURNING POLAND AWAY FROM THE PATH OF REFORM AND RECONCILIATION.
88	USING CROSS-COUNTRY MICRO ESTABLISHMENT-LEVEL DATA WE DOCUMENT THAT CRIME AND LACK OF ACCESS TO FINANCE ARE TWO MAJOR OBSTACLES TO BUSINESS OPERATION IN POOR AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN AN OTHERWISE STANDARD MODEL OF PRODUCTION HETEROGENEITY THAT INTEGRATES INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW, WE QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ON AGGREGATE OUTCOMES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR THE PATTERNS ACROSS ESTABLISHMENTS IN ACCESS TO FINANCE AND CRIME AS OBSTACLES TO THEIR OPERATION. WEAKER FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND RULE OF LAW HAVE SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON AGGREGATE OUTPUT, REDUCING OUTPUT PER CAPITA BY 50 PERCENT. WEAK RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS SUBSTANTIALLY AMPLIFY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL FRICTIONS. WHILE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE CRUCIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT, AN ESSENTIAL PRECONDITION TO REAP THE GAINS FROM FINANCIAL LIBERALIZATION IS THAT PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE SECURE.
89	THIS STUDY OFFERS A THEORETICAL OUTLINE FOR EXPLAINING THE SOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO SOUTH KOREA. IT PROPOSES TO EXPLICATE THE CONDITIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF THE PLAY OF POWER AND TO CONCEIVE THE RULE OF LAW AS A PRODUCT OF INTERPLAY BETWEEN DIFFERENT FORMS OF POWER INSTEAD OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF POWER. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO FORMS OF POWER IDENTIFIED IN EXISTING SOCIAL THEORY-POLITICO-JURIDICAL POWER AND DISCIPLINARY POWER-THE STUDY ADVANCES A THIRD NOTION OF POWER, WHICH THE AUTHOR TERMS "RELATIONAL POWER." IT CONSTRUCTS THE NOTION OUT OF THE AMORPHOUS FORCE EMANATING FROM FLUID PERSONAL RELATIONS AND INTERPERSONAL COMMITMENT, WHICH CULTURAL STUDIES OF EAST ASIA HAVE DISCERNED IN TERMS OF TRADITIONAL AFFECTIVE TIES OR GUANXI. THE STUDY MAPS PERMUTATIONS LINKING RULE BY LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW WITH EACH OF THE THREE KINDS OF POWER, AND DISCUSSES HOW THE THREE KINDS OF POWER COMPLEMENT AND CANCEL OUT ONE ANOTHER IN STRENGTHENING OR OBSTRUCTING RULE BY LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW.
90	THE FIRST SEGMENT STARTS WITH A DEFINITION OF TWO DIMENSIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW; RELATED TO THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY AND AS A CONCEPT TO CONTROL ARBITRARINESS ON THE PART OF THE RULER. THE SEGMENT PROCEEDS TO GIVE A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE NOTION AND THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF ITS EPISTEMOLOGICAL CONFIGURATION, FROM THE ANCIENT GREEK NOTION OF EUNOMIA AND ITS INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE POPULAR RULE TO THE CURRENT NOTION, WHERE THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME FUSED WITH DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE FIRST SEGMENT ALSO FOCUSES ON THE RELATION BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER PRINCIPLES, SUCH AS PROPORTIONALITY, NEUTRALITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS. THE SECOND SEGMENT OF THE PAPER ANALYSES THE PHENOMENON OF JURIDIFICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONS. IT PAYS PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ROLE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL ACCOMMODATION PLAYS IN THE PROCESS OF RATIONALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A PREREQUISITE TO ITS IDEALIZATION AND MYSTIFICATION. IT ANALYSES THE REASON WHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISM DESPITE THE INNER PLURALITY OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE NEXT ASPECT, ANALYSED IN THE THIRD SEGMENT OF THIS PAPER, IS THE MESSIANIC USE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER PERFORMS A CRITICAL DEFINITION OF MESSIANIC, COVERING A THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND THE DIFFERENT THEORIES AND CONCEPTS THAT GO HAND IN HAND WITH THE IDEA OF THE MESSIAH, SUCH AS THE COMING, PROPHETICAL AND APOCALYPTICAL MESSIANISM, THE PHENOMENA OF ESCHATOLOGY, EXPIATION AND REDEMPTION PICTURED IN JUDAISM. THE SEGMENT ALSO COVERS THE SECULAR TRANSPLANTATION OF THE MESSIANIC THOUGHT. THE LAST SEGMENT IS A CONCLUSION RETURNING TO THE THEMES IDENTIFIED IN THE PAPER AND SUMMARISES HOW THE MESSIANIC THOUGHT IS APPLIED IN THE REALM OF THE RULE OF LAW.
91	SO-CALLED 'MAGNITSKY LAWS' IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS ARE TURNING UNILATERAL SANCTIONS INTO NORMALISED INSTRUMENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE CONSIDERABLE REGULATORY AND EXECUTIVE FLEXIBILITY INTRODUCED BY THESE LAWS IS AT STRAIN WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. DESPITE A GROWING LITERATURE ON SANCTIONS, A SYSTEMATIC AND COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF MAGNITSKY LAWS AGAINST BOTH THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS STILL LACKING. THIS PAPER OFFERS A FIRST COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPATIBILITY OF US, CANADIAN, UK, AND AUSTRALIAN UNILATERAL SANCTIONS LAWS WITH THE FORMAL AND PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT CONSTITUTE THE COMMON CORE OF BOTH ITS NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NOTIONS. BY ANALYSING THE FORMAL ASPECTS OF THE LEGAL BASIS, DESIGN AND APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS, OUR STUDY IDENTIFIES AND CONCEPTUALISES THE LEGISLATIVE TECHNIQUES THAT ENABLE THE NORMALISATION OF MAGNITSKY SANCTIONS. WE FIND THAT THESE TECHNIQUES, WHICH WE NAME THE 'GENERALISATION' OF SANCTIONS LAWS, ARE NOT INHERENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, BUT SO FAR NATIONAL LEGISLATORS HAVE FAILED TO ENSURE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THE FLEXIBILITY INTRODUCED BY SUCH TECHNIQUES AND THE RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS OF LEGALITY. THE PRINCIPLED RECOMMENDATIONS WE PROPOSE BASED ON OUR FINDINGS SEEK TO HELP LAWMAKERS AROUND THE WORLD TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FORM AND FLEXIBILITY.
92	THE RULE OF LAW IS PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES THAT DEFINE THE FORM OF STATE IN CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRATIC AND CONSTITUTIONAL STATES AND IS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL VALUE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. IN THIS ARTICLE WE APPROACH THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW USED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION, IDENTIFYING THE PRINCIPLES THAT COMPOSE IT (INCLUDING THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, LEGAL CERTAINTY, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE) AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES SUCH AS RESPECT FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND THE DIVISION OF POWERS -THAT FORM THE BROAD CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW- AND DEMOCRACY. FROM THIS ANALYSIS EMERGES A CONCEPT THAT IS BOTH FORMAL AND MATERIAL OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE NOT VERY EXPLICIT ASSUMPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS CONSTITUTIONALISM, WHICH INCORPORATES CONTROL OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LAWS.
93	WHAT BRINGS ABOUT NORMATIVE CHANGE IN DEVELOPING STATES WITH HISTORIES OF CORRUPTION AND POOR GOVERNANCE? POST-NAFTA MEXICO GIVES US A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY A SINGLE NORM (RULE OF LAW) IN TWO DIFFERENT SECTORS (ENVIRONMENT AND LABOR). MUCH CAN BE CONTROLLED-THE TIMING OF NEW OVERSIGHT PRESSURES FROM OUTSIDE (NAFTA AND THE US) AS WELL AS INSIDE (COURTS AND FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AGENCY). SOCIALIZATION OF RULE OF LAW NORMS IS THEREFORE BEST EXPLAINED BY LOOKING CAREFULLY AT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELEVANT AGENCIES. I SHOW THAT VARIATION IN 1) LEVELS OF PROFESSIONALIZATION AMONG AGENCY OFFICIALS AND 2) PERMEABILITY OF DOMESTIC AGENCIES TO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE, EXPLAINS MUCH OF THE VARIATION BETWEEN LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICIALS OVER ATTITUDES TO RULE OF LAW. LABOR AGENCIES WERE FAR MORE CONSTRAINED BY LEGACIES OF HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL VESTED INTERESTS, AND THIS LIMITED THEIR CAPACITY TO ADAPT TO NEW NORMATIVE PRESSURES. THESE FINDINGS SHARPEN OUR UNDERSTANDINGS OF HOW A PRO-RULE OF LAW CULTURE CAN BE EMBEDDED, BECAUSE THE TWO SECTORS WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUBJECT TO THE NEW OVERSIGHT AND SPOTLIGHTING PRESSURES.
94	TRIANGULATION OF THE VARIOUS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE SINCE IT ALLOWS THE COMBINATION OF BENEFITS AND ELIMINATION OF PROBLEMATIC ASPECTS IN EACH. THE PRESENT ARTICLE TRIANGULATES THE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF THREE APPROACHES RELATING TO THE RULE OF LAW, NAMELY BEDNER'S REVIEW OF THE RULE OF LAW THEORIES, THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT'S RULE OF LAW INDEX, AND THE REVIEW BY HORAK ET AL. OF EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS, AND IDENTIFIES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM. MORE PRECISELY, THE THEORETICAL CONCEPTUALIZATIONS ARE NOT FULLY PREPARED FOR EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT, AND THE EMPIRICAL TOOLS DO NOT REFLECT THE THEORETICAL DEBATE AND ITS OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, A NEW CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PROPOSED TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY MAKE THE EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT MORE VALID.
95	THE CHINESE EXPRESSION OF THE DIRECTION AND PROGRESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF SHOWCASING CHINA'S STAND AND IDEAS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, AND SERVES AS A MAJOR INTERACTIVE LINK BETWEEN THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THE PROGRESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW RESTS ON THE ACTIVE, FULL AND EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES INCLUDING CHINA, SO THAT IT CAN BECOME MORE JUST AND RATIONAL. IN ORDER TO EXPRESS ITSELF EXPLICITLY AND EFFECTIVELY, CHINA NEEDS TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN THE PRACTICES OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, IN A BID TO EXPAND ITS HORIZON, ENLIST PUBLIC SUPPORT, AND OBTAIN OPPORTUNITIES.
96	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE KEY ASPECTS OF A DEBATE ON THE CONCEPT OF THE STATE AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ECONOMIC STUDIES. ON THE BASIS OF SELECTED RESEARCH REPORTS, THE AUTHORS DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF STUDIES ON THE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW ON PROSPERITY. THE PAPER REVIEWS THE MOST COMMON DEFINITIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW AND METHODS FOR MEASURING THEM. IT FOLLOWS UP WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE RESULTS OF STUDIES ON HOW ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW INFLUENCE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE ANALYSIS MADE IN THE PAPER SHOWS THAT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEY HAVE A MAJOR POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE RATE OF GROWTH. ECONOMIC FREEDOM PROMOTES INNOVATION IN BUSINESS AND PROSPERITY. HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT TENDS TO LIMIT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND FORCES BUSINESSES TO BEHAVE IN A SPECIFIC WAY TO BENEFIT THE ECONOMY AND THE PUBLIC. THIS WORKS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT ACTS IN KEEPING WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE AUTHORS SAY. THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTES BUSINESS EFFICIENCY AND LEADS TO LOWER TRANSACTION COSTS, WHICH RESULTS IN FASTER ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE.
97	A LOOK INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENERAL RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT, FROM A DISTINCTLY CHRISTIAN ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE, AND WILDLIFE (NAMELY ELEPHANT) POACHING IN KENYA. HOW CAN THE CONCRETE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SOLID LEGAL FOUNDATION AND RULE OF LAW HELP COMBAT WIDESPREAD ELEPHANT POACHING IN KENYA AND THE SURROUNDING REGIONS? HOW CAN RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT HELP TO CREATE A "KENYAN-SPECIFIC" SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE?
98	THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF RULE OF LAW NORMS AND INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN ASSUMED IN THE PEACEBUILDING LITERATURE, WITH EMPIRICAL WORK FOCUSING MORE ON PROCESSES OF COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS IN WAR-TORN COUNTRIES. YET, THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT PURPORTEDLY 'GOOD' RULE OF LAW NORMS DO NOT ALWAYS DELIVER BENIGN BENEFITS BUT RATHER OFTEN HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT HARM THE VERY LOCAL CONSTITUENTS THAT PEACEBUILDERS PROMISE TO HELP. SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN WAR-TORN COUNTRIES DISPROPORTIONATELY FAVOURS ACTORS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY PRIVILEGED BY UNEQUAL SOCIO-LEGAL AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURES AT THE EXPENSE OF THOSE WHOM PEACEBUILDERS CLAIM TO EMANCIPATE. BY ENTRENCHING AN INEQUITABLE STATE SYSTEM WHICH BENEFITS THOSE WITH WEALTH, EDUCATION, AND INFLUENCE, RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS HAVE REINFORCED STRUCTURAL, SOCIAL, AND COST-RELATED BARRIERS TO JUSTICE. THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS EXPLAIN WHY WAR-TORN SOCIETIES AVOID THE FORMAL COURTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DESPITE SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PROFESSIONALISE AND STRENGTHEN THESE INSTITUTIONS TO MEET GLOBAL RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. THE ARGUMENT IS DRAWN FROM AN HISTORICAL, COMPARATIVE, AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE UK-FUNDED JUSTICE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN SIERRA LEONE AND US-SUPPORTED RULE OF LAW REFORMS IN LIBERIA - TWO POSTWAR COUNTRIES OFTEN CITED AS PROTOTYPES OF SUCCESSFUL PEACEBUILDING.
99	BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE, THE ARTICLE'S OBJECTIVE IS THREEFOLD. FIRST, IT CONCEPTUALLY RE-EXAMINES THE OFTEN ASSUMED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMY. SECONDLY, IT SITUATES THIS CONCEPTUAL RELATIONSHIP IN THE PRESENT CRISIS-RIDDEN CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS SYNTHESIZED IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE. BY SO DOING, IT DEMONSTRATES THAT DUE TO THE EU'S PLURALIST NATURE, THE ECONOMIC AND RULE OF LAW CRISES HAVE HAD VERY DIFFERENT FACES AND CONSEQUENCES IN DIFFERENT MEMBER STATES. DESPITE THAT THE ARTICLE IN CONCLUSION NEVERTHELESS TRIES TO IDENTIFY THE SHARED PATTERNS OF THE CRISIS AND, IN THE INEVITABLE ABSENCE OF A SINGLE WAY OF IMPROVING THE SITUATION, PROPOSES AT LEAST A COMMON ONE.
100	THE INTERFACES BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EVOLVED DUE TO SUBJECT-MATTER OVERLAP BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE RESTRICTION OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY BY THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS NO EXCEPTION IN THIS REGARD. INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS SO FAR LARGELY EXAMINED THE NATIONAL RECEPTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. MUCH LESS RECOGNISED IS THE INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: NAMELY, AS TO HOW THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW UNDERSTANDS, ACCEPTS, OR RESISTS THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE INTERNATIONAL RECEPTION OF NATIONAL RULE OF LAW PRACTICES WITHIN A SPECIFIC REGULATORY CONTEXT OF UN TARGETED SANCTIONS. MEMBER STATES' EXERCISE OF AUTHORITY AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL'S LISTING DECISIONS BEAR RESEMBLANCE TO EACH OTHER, WHICH CREATES THE CONDITIONS FOR THE INTERFACES BETWEEN THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. A SERIES OF JUDICIAL CONTESTATIONS FORMALLY BASED ON THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW WERE TRANSLATED INTO NORMATIVE, THEORETICAL, AND POLITICAL FORCES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, LEADING TO THE GENERATION AND MATERIALISATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
101	DEFINED BROADLY, THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO ADDRESS THE FUNCTIONING OF DEMOCRACY IN URUGUAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THIS IS NOT AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT EVENTS, IT IS FOCUSED ON THE FRENTE AMPLIO GOVERNMENT IN URUGUAY (2005-2010). THIS ARTICLE HAS TWO PARTS AND AN EPILOGUE. IN THE FIRST PART, WE ESTABLISH SOME SUBSTANTIVE ASPECT OF THE CONTEMPORARY DEBATE ABOUT DEMOCRACY, ADDRESSING THE REQUIREMENTS OF A MINIMALIST DEMOCRACY, ALONGSIDE THOSE MORE COMPLEX INVOLVING A QUALITY DEMOCRACY. IN THE SECOND PART, WE PRESENT THE MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DEMOCRACY IN URUGUAY, WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY, WE PRESENT A SET OF CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE RISKY AREAS AND WORRYING ELEMENTS FOR THE GOVERNANCE THAT ARE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY IN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CONTEMPORARY URUGUAYAN DEMOCRACY.
102	BY USING DATA FOR 45 COUNTRIES, FOR A TIME SPAN BETWEEN 2009 AND 2014, THE PRESENT PAPER SUPPORTS THE THESIS OF A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE RULE OF LAW VARIABLE REPORTED BY WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS IS CONSIDERED. THE RELATIONSHIP REMAINS ROBUST EVEN IF CONTROL VARIABLES SUCH AS OTHER LEGAL SYSTEM VARIABLES, INCLUDING PROTECTION OF MINORITY INVESTORS, ENFORCING CONTRACTS OR STRENGTH OF LEGAL RIGHTS OF BORROWERS AND LENDERS AS WELL AS INITIAL LEVELS OF MARKET DEVELOPMENT, ECONOMIC GROWTH, MARKET LIQUIDITY, DOMESTIC CREDIT TO PRIVATE SECTOR AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED.
103	IS "RULE OF LAW'' ANYTHING MORE THAN A FICTIONAL ALLUSION? AFTER ALL, "LAW'' IS AN ABSTRACT NOUN, AND ABSTRACT NOUNS CAN'T RULE. ONLY PEOPLE CAN RULE. THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY INVOKES A CENTRAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN CHOOSING RULES AND PLAYING WITHIN THOSE RULES. CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A RULE OF LAW REQUIRE A SHARP DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE ENFORCEMENT OF AGREED-UPON RULES AND ARBITRARY CHANGES IN THOSE RULES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHETHER THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH IT COULD REASONABLY BE CLAIMED THAT GOVERNANCE REFLECTS A DEEP LEVEL OPERATION OF A RULE OF LAW DESPITE THE SURFACE LEVEL RECOGNITION THAT IT IS MEN WHO RULE. WITH THE EXERCISE OF RULERSHIP BEING A SOCIAL PROCESS AND NOT A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL ACTION, THE NETWORK PATTERN THROUGH WHICH RULES ARE ENFORCED TAKES ON PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE. IN PARTICULAR, POLYCENTRIC ARCHITECTURES ARE GENERALLY MORE CONSISTENT WITH RULE OF LAW THAN MONOCENTRIC ARCHITECTURES.
104	THE RULE OF LAW AS A FUNDAMENTAL MEANS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE HAS TWO LEVELS, THE NATIONAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL. THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, DEFINED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE CONCEPTS, ORIENTATIONS AND FUNCTIONS, ADDRESS GOVERNANCE ISSUES AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. INTERDEPENDENT, THEY ARE LINKED EFFECTIVELY BY TWO CORE FACTORS OF THE RULE OF LAW: "GOOD LAW" AND "GOOD GOVERNANCE." BETWEEN THEM IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OF INTERACTION, A BASIC EXPRESSION OF THEIR UNIFIED RELATIONSHIP. THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR INTERACTION COMPRISES THREE BASIC ELEMENTS: INDIVIDUAL STATES AND THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW; AND THE MEDIUM OF RULE OF LAW INTERACTION. THIS INTERACTION IS TWO-WAY, CYCLICAL, DIVERSIFIED, COMPREHENSIVE AND INCREMENTAL. IN THIS INTERACTIVE PROCESS, CHINA NEEDS TO DEFINE ITS INTERNATIONAL POSITION AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW SO AS TO ESTABLISH ITS DISCOURSE RIGHT IN THIS FIELD.
105	THE STANDARD ACCOUNT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW FOCUSES ON LAW'S LIBERTY-ENHANCING ROLE IN CONSTRAINING OFFICIAL ACTION. THIS IS A FAINT ECHO OF THE COMPLEX, CONSTITUTIVE RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO. THE GREEKS USED ONE WORD - ISONOMIA - TO DESCRIBE BOTH. IF DEMOCRACY IS THE SYSTEM IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE AN EQUAL SAY IN DETERMINING THE RULES THAT GOVERN SOCIAL LIFE, THEN THE RULE OF LAW IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BEFORE, AFTER, CONCURRENT AND SYNONYMOUS WITH DEMOCRACY: IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION OF CITIZENS WITH THE CAPACITY FOR SELF-GOVERNANCE, SERVES AS THE INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH DEMOCRATIC DECISIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED, FUNCTIONS AS ONE OF THE CENTRAL SOCIAL PRACTICES THAT CONSTITUTE CITIZENS AS EQUALS AND ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF HOW TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT BY THE PEOPLE OPERATES FOR THE PEOPLE. THE RULE OF LAW HAS MANY INDEPENDENTLY VALUABLE QUALITIES, INCLUDING IMPARTIALITY AND PREDICTABILITY. BUT, TO VALORISE THE RULE OF LAW FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS TO FETISHIZE AUTHORITY. THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE AS THE INSTRUMENT OF DEMOCRATIC SELF-GOVERNANCE AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE EQUAL DIGNITY OF ALL PERSONS. DEMOCRACY THUS ENTAILS THE RULE OF LAW, BUT BOTH IMPLICATE THE YET MORE COMPREHENSIVE IDEAL OF EQUALITY. CORE RULE-OF-LAW VALUES REQUIRE POLITICAL NORMS AND CONDITIONS OF EQUALITY, GENERALITY AND COMPREHENSIVENESS. IN A MODERN, DIFFERENTIATED SOCIETY, HOWEVER, THE CONSTITUTIVE RELATION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IS FRACTURED AND LAW BECOMES THE AGENT OF AUTHORITY. COURTS IN THE MODERN CONSTITUTIONAL STATE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE OF RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, SUPPORTING ROLE SPECIALIZATION THROUGH JUDGE-MADE IMMUNITY DOCTRINES THAT PROTECT OFFICIALS AT ALL LEVELS. THE CRISIS OF POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST MINORITIES IS A SYMPTOM OF THIS BREAKDOWN. GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY CAN AMELIORATE THE PROBLEM. BUT AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION REQUIRES THE FAIR AND EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL POWER.
106	THE EU ADOPTED A NEW ENLARGEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE WESTERN BALKANS COUNTRIES IN 2018, PROVIDED A TIME FRAME FOR SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO POTENTIALLY TO JOIN THE UNION BY 2025, AND OUTLINED THE NEXT STEPS FOR ACCESSION FOR ALBANIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, KOSOVO, AND NORTH MACEDONIA. IN MARCH 2020, THE EU GAVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO THE OPENING OF ACCESSION TALKS WITH NORTH MACEDONIA AND ALBANIA, AND ALSO INTRODUCED A NEW REFORMED 'ACCESSION TALKS' FRAMEWORK. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW, FIGHTING CORRUPTION AND ORGANISED CRIME ARE THE CORNERSTONES OF THE EU-WESTERN BALKANS STRATEGY OF 2018 AND THE NEW ACCESSION TALKS FRAMEWORK OF 2020. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LATEST ENLARGEMENT POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018-2020 BY CONCEPTUALISING HOW THE EU PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS THOROUGH ITS NEW ENLARGEMENT POLICY PACKAGE. FURTHERMORE, THE ARTICLE OFFERS AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE CASE OF ALBANIA, WHERE THE EU HAS EXPERIMENTED WITH SOME OF ITS LATEST ENLARGEMENT-POLICY IDEAS IN REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ALSO OFFERS SOME PROPOSALS AND INSIGHTS ON HOW THE EU RULE OF LAW INITIATIVE OF 2018 CAN BE IMPROVED, IN ORDER TO BECOME MORE TRANSFORMATIVE IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN COUNTRIES OF THE WESTERN BALKANS.
107	DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE EXIST AND DEVELOP AS TWO 'POCKET UNIVERSES' IN A SENSE THAT THEY BELONG TO THE SAME FABRIC OF REALITY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME MANY CONCEPTS SHIFT THEIR MEANING WHEN MOVED FROM ONE POCKET TO ANOTHER. THIS IS OF A PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FOR THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IN DOMESTIC SETTING WAS FORGED IN THE FLAME OF CIVIL WARS AND STRUGGLES AGAINST THE RULERS. THIS HISTORY AND SUCH STRUGGLES ARE SOMETHING INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS NEVER KNOWN, AND THUS ANY DIRECT TRANSPLANTATION OF THE DOMESTIC IMAGES OF THE RULE OF LAW TO INTERNATIONAL REALM ARE DOOMED TO FAIL. THIS ENTAILS A NEED IN DECONSTRUCTING THE RULE OF LAW. ITS CORE MEANING ('LAWS MUST BE OBEYED'), BRINGS A NORMATIVE CLAIM RELEVANT TO ANY LEGAL ORDER. THE IDEA OF THE (INTERNATIONAL) RULE OF LAW APPEARS TO BE LINKED TO THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY OF (INTERNATIONAL) LAW. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF THE STRUCTURES OF AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AS AUTHORITY CAN BE MEDIATED OR UNMEDIATED. MEDIATION OF AUTHORITY, TYPICAL FOR DOMESTIC LAW, PRESUPPOSES THE EXISTENCE OF OFFICIALS THAT ARE FUNCTIONALLY AND INSTITUTIONALLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM THE SUBJECTS OF LAW. AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS BY AND LARGE UNMEDIATED BECAUSE OF ITS HORIZONTAL NATURE. SUCH RECONSTRUCTION ALLOWS TO REFRAME THE CENTRAL CONCERN OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW ENQUIRIES. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIT IT TO THE PROCRUSTEAN BED OF DOMESTIC THEORIES, INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP MUST FOCUS ON DEFINING CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH INTERNATIONAL LAW'S CLAIM TO AUTHORITY IS REALISABLE.
108	THE RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF 'THE RULE OF LAW' BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND ATTORNEY-GENERAL RELIES UPON A SHARED NOTION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS A GOOD THING. WHILE EVERYONE IS IN FAVOUR OF IT, DO WE REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS? EVEN IF WE DO, IS IT THE CASE THAT WE TAKE IT TO MEAN THE SAME THING AS OTHER PEOPLE? BY ADOPTING A CRITICAL VIEW OF RULE OF LAW CONCEPTIONS THAT ARE ACCEPTED AS CONSTITUTING THE MEANING OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, I EXPOSE THE PROBLEMS IN THINKING THAT WE ALL KNOW, OR AGREE, WHAT THE RULE OF LAW IS.
109	CLASSICAL ATHENS IS OFTEN HELD UP AS A MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW. BUT WHILE IT DID GIVE LAW CENTRAL AND SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ITS PUBLIC LIFE, IT DID NOT HAVE THE INSTITUTIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO REALIZE THE IDEAL FULLY. IT LACKED A WAY OF HELPING TO MAKE THE INTERPRETATION OF LAW UNIFORM ACROSS DIFFERENT EXECUTIVE AND PARTICULARLY JUDICIAL SITES.
110	RESEARCH QUESTION/ISSUE WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE MODERN CORPORATION? HOW IS THE RULE OF LAW RELATED TO THE PURPOSE OF THE MODERN CORPORATION? RESEARCH FINDINGS/INSIGHTS WE STUDY THE ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN ENABLING CORPORATIONS TO ENHANCE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DIMINISH INCOME INEQUALITY ACROSS THE GLOBE. THEORETICAL/ACADEMIC IMPLICATIONS FIRST, WE PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN ENHANCING ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DIMINISHING INCOME INEQUALITY ACROSS THE GLOBE. NEXT, WE DRAW ON THE LAW AND FINANCE LITERATURE AND THE FINANCE AND GROWTH LITERATURE TO HIGHLIGHT THE ROLE OF RULE OF LAW IN ENABLING CORPORATIONS TO BE THE MAJOR DRIVER OF A COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. SPECIFICALLY, RULE OF LAW IS NECESSARY FOR A CITIZENRY'S BELIEF IN SECURE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH GIVES THE CITIZENRY CONFIDENCE TO INVEST IN PHYSICAL CAPITAL, HUMAN CAPITAL, AND INNOVATION-THE THREE CATALYSTS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALSO, THE RULE OF LAW ALLOWS FOR AN EFFECTIVE JUDICIARY THAT CAN ENFORCE LEGAL CONTRACTS. SHAREHOLDER RELIANCE ON LIMITED LIABILITY AND DEBTHOLDER RIGHTS ORIGINATE FROM THE LEGAL CONTRACTS AMONG SHAREHOLDERS, DEBTHOLDERS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF RULE OF LAW IN ENABLING COMPANIES TO RAISE EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCING, LEADING TO FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT. GIVEN THIS BACKGROUND ON THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY CAPITAL TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO CORPORATIONS, WE ANALYZE THE CURRENT DEBATE AMONG POLICYMAKERS, CORPORATE LEADERS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, AND SOCIAL ACTIVISTS ON THE PURPOSE OF THE MODERN CORPORATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MODERN CORPORATION SHOULD MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE, WHILE CONFORMING TO THE LAW OF THE LAND. PRACTITIONER/POLICY IMPLICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, POLICYMAKERS SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING RULE OF LAW-THIS ENHANCES ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DIMINISHES INCOME INEQUALITY. AT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY LEVEL, WE SUGGEST STEPS TO ALIGN SHAREHOLDER WEALTH MAXIMIZATION WITH STAKEHOLDER INTERESTS: FIRST, ANTITRUST PUBLIC POLICIES SHOULD BE VIGOROUSLY ENFORCED TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE COMPETITION IN PRODUCT MARKETS AND LABOR MARKETS. SECOND, MANAGEMENT AND BOARD COMPENSATION SHOULD BE REFORMED TO FOCUS ON CREATING AND SUSTAINING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE. FINALLY, FOR MANY OF SOCIETY'S MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS, CORPORATIONS DO NOT REPRESENT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ACTION. CLIMATE CHANGE, FOR EXAMPLE, POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR SOCIETIES AND BUSINESSES. BUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRE PUBLIC POLICY CHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. TURNING MORE TO CORPORATIONS BECAUSE THE POLITICAL PROCESS SEEMS BROKEN WILL NOT DO.
111	THE IMPACT OF LAW IN SHAPING THE WAY IN WHICH SPATIAL PLANNING IS CONDUCTED IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED AND ATTITUDES TO LAW ARE OFTEN PURELY INSTRUMENTAL. THIS PAPER LOOKS AT HOW THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS EVOLVED IN ENGLAND, AND WHAT EFFECT IT HAS HAD ON PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ON SPATIAL PLANNING PROCESSES IN PARTICULAR. IT LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT THE ROLE OF EQUITY WITHIN THE COMMON-LAW TRADITION AND THE WAY IN WHICH EQUITABLE JUDGMENT HAS COLOURED ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING. IT CONCLUDES THAT BY COMPARISON WITH LEGAL PROCESSES DECISION-MAKING IN SPATIAL PLANNING IS OFTEN INSUFFICIENTLY RIGOROUS.
112	IN THIS PAPER, WE LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE RULE OF LAW, USING THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT RULE OF LAW INDEX, WHICH INCLUDE INDEX FIGURES ON HUMAN RIGHTS, LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT POWERS, TRANSPARENCY AND REGULATORY EFFICIENCY. BASED ON REGRESSION ANALYSES USING THE RULE OF LAW INDEX FIGURES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE FIGURES (MERCHANDISE TRADE, SERVICE TRADE, EXPORTS AND IMPORTS AS PERCENTAGE OF GDP,) INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS SEEM TO HAVE LITTLE RELATIONSHIP; BUT TRADE HAS A CLOSE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH STRONG ORDER AND SECURITY. SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, REGULATORY TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE OR NO EFFECT ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND VICE VERSA. INTERNATIONAL TRADE SHOWS A CLEAR POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTRY'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOT AS CLEAR AS SUCH. FOR REGULATORY IMPLEMENTATION AND CIVIL JUSTICE, SERVICES TRADE POSITIVELY AFFECT THESE INSTITUTIONS, BUT THESE INSTITUTIONS IN TURN AFFECT EXPORTS MORE STRONGLY THAN SERVICES TRADE. FINALLY, THE EFFECT OF TRADE ON RULE OF LAW IS STRONGER ON A MEDIUM TO LONG TERM (10-20 YEAR) TIME HORIZON.
113	THE RECENT RISE OF THE RULE OF LAW, FROM CONTROVERSIAL LEGAL IDEAL TO UNOPPOSED INTERNATIONAL CLICHE/SLOGAN, HAS RENDERED INCREASINGLY MURKY WHAT THE CONCEPT MIGHT MEAN, WHAT THE PHENOMENON MIGHT BE, AND WHAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, NEVERTHELESS, THAT THE CONCEPT ENGAGES WITH FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING ISSUES OF POLITICS AND LAW, PARTICULARLY THE DANGERS OF ARBITRARY POWER, AND THE VALUE OF ITS INSTITUTIONALIZED TEMPERING. THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL, IF NOT ALL THE WAYS IT IS INVOKED, BY RECOVERING SOME PAST THINKING ABOUT AND EXPERIENCE WITH AND WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW UNDERSTOOD THIS WAY. THE REVIEW CRITICIZES CURRENT DISCUSSIONS FOR THEIR TEMPORAL PAROCHIALISM AND THEIR INADEQUATE TREATMENT OF IDEALS AND OF CONTEXTS. IT CONCLUDES WITH TWO PLEAS: A CALL FOR A SOCIAL SCIENCE THAT DOES NOT EXIST, AND A SUGGESTION THAT, IN ORDER TO PURSUE ITS OWN IDEALS, THE TIME MIGHT HAVE COME TO MOVE BEYOND THE RULE OF LAW.
114	THIS PAPER ARGUES FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A CONSTITUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, FORMED BY A SET OF VALUES AND PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORAL AND ORIGINALLY LEGAL, BUT THAT ARE IN RELATION TO LAW'S CONSTITUTIVE DIMENSIONS AND NOT WITH CONTINGENT DEMANDS RAISED TO IT FROM AN EXTERNAL MORALITY. THE CONTENT OF THIS CONSTITUTION IS LOCATED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL OPTION BY THE RULE OF LAW AS A METHOD OF GOVERNMENT, THAT IS, IN THE OPTION FOR THE EXERCISE IN A LEGAL FORM OF SOCIAL CONTROL. THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, AS CONSTITUTIVE CONDITIONS OF THE FORM OF LAW, ARE A NECESSARY PART OF THAT CONSTITUTION. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE ALSO THE NORMATIVE EXPRESSION OF A SERIES OF MORAL VALUES: CONTROL OF ARBITRARY COERCION, LIMITATION OF POWER, AGENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL, AND FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE WILL OF THE OTHERS GUARANTEED IN THE ADJUDICATIVE PROCESSES. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE VALUES WITH THE LAW SHOWS THAT IT IS NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO MORALITY, SINCE IT CONSISTS OF A SPECIFIC MORALITY, IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE FORM OF EXPRESSION OF SOCIAL CONTROL CLAIMED BY THE VALUES THAT FORM IT.
115	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES OF THE 2022 CZECH PRESIDENCY IN ONE OF ITS PRIORITY AREAS, NAMELY DEMOCRATIC RESILIENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW. BY ANALYSING THE TWO INHERITED ARTICLE 7 (1) PROCEDURES AGAINST POLAND AND HUNGARY AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM AGAINST HUNGARY, I ARGUE THAT THE CZECH PRESIDENCY'S MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT WAS THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE CONDITIONALITY PROCEDURE DESPITE HUNGARY'S HOSTAGE POLICY. BESIDES, THE CZECH PRESIDENCY'S HANDLING OF THE RULE OF LAW PROCEDURES HAD CRUCIAL SYMBOLIC IMPLICATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT MANAGED TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THE NOTION THAT CZECHIA IS A MEMBER OF THE 'ILLIBERAL' VISEGRAD BLOC AND INSTEAD DEMONSTRATED ITS PRO-DEMOCRATIC AND PRO- EUROPEAN ORIENTATION.
116	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM AND RULE OF LAW. AL AZHAR, ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED SUNNI RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN THE WORLD, DEVELOPED A MODEL OF AN ISLAMIC CONSTITUTION. THIS STUDY USES AL-AZHAR'S CONSTITUTION AS A MODEL OF ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM AND EXAMINES ITS STANCE IN REGARD TO THE RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THE AL- AZHAR'S CONSTITUTION TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS OF RULE OF LAW. FOR EXAMPLE, THE POWERS VESTED IN THE HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC STATE ARE ENORMOUS, MAKING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT FAR SUPERIOR TO THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES. WOMEN AND NONMUSLIMS ARE EXPLICITLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION. MOREOVER, LAWS STEMMING FROM THIS CONSTITUTION ARE NOT STABLE SINCE MANY DIFFERENCES EXIST AMONG SCHOOLS OF ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE (FIQH). CONSEQUENTLY, WE SHOW THAT STATE-OF-THE- ART ISLAMIC CONSTITUTIONALISM LACKS ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS NEEDED IN ANY CONSTITUTION BASED ON RULE OF LAW.
117	THIS CONTRIBUTION CRITICALLY ANALYSES THE FOUR LIMBS OF THE EU'S DEFENCE MECHANISM UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE UNION. THE FIRST BEING THE INDIVIDUAL POST ACCESSION RULE OF LAW MECHANISM, INTRODUCED BY THE COMMISSION IN 2006 FOR THE TWO NEW MEMBER STATES BULGARIA AND RUMANIA. THE SECOND, AND ARGUABLY MOST POWERFUL LIMB, INVOLVES THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE CONDUCTING A JUDICIAL REVIEW OF A MEMBER STATE'S RULE OF LAW SITUATION, WHICH IS OF FAR GREATER CONCERN FOR REVIEWED MEMBERS THAN THE SO-CALLED "NUCLEAR" LAST-RESORT OPTION OF ART. 7 TEU'S SANCTION MECHANISM (FOURTH LIMB) THAT IS POLITICALLY DIFFICULT TO ENACT. WITH A VIEW TO THE POLITICALLY FRAUGHT ART. 7 TEU, THE COMMISSION INTRODUCED A NEW "EARLY WARNING" RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK IN 2014 WHICH PRE-EMPTIVELY ENABLES EXPLORING DIALOGUE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO RULE-OF LAW ISSUES AS THEY EMERGE (THIRD LIMB).
118	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE PROCESS OF TRANSNATIONALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TIMES OF GLOBALISATION. THE ECONOMIC CRISIS SERVES AS A STAGE FOR OUR ANALYSIS, IN WHICH THE PRECONDITIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE CHALLENGED. THE AUSTRIAN CASE STUDY FOCUSES ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE AUSTRIAN BANKING SYSTEMS AND ENABLES US TO UNDERSTAND HOW INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND EUROPEAN REGULATION AFFECT THE DOMESTIC CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF HELPING TO RE-ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN TIMES OF CRISIS. THE EXAMPLE PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO HOW, IN THE SPECIFIC INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW SHAPED BY AUSTRIAN LEGAL CULTURE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, A UNIQUE TRANSNATIONAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS DEVELOPED. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE RULE OF LAW IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT IN ITS PLURALITY OF TRANSNATIONAL RULES OF LAW, WHICH DEPEND ON THE UNIQUE INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
119	A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE POLITICAL REVIVAL OF CONFUCIANISM HAS BEEN ITS TENSION WITH THE RULE OF LAW. SYSTEMIC FEATURES OF CONFUCIANISM SUCH AS SOCIAL HIERARCHY (AND THE CORRESPONDING SOCIAL INEQUALITY), RELIANCE ON DISCRETION, DISTRUST OF PRACTITIONERS OF LAWS ARE AT ODDS WITH RULE OF LAW'S BASIC TENETS SUCH AS EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, RULE OF LEGAL RULES RATHER THAN MAN, AND FAITH IN DUE PROCESS OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT THROUGH DIFFERENTIATING 'RULE OF LAW' IN THE 'THICK' SENSE FROM THE 'THIN' SENSE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECONCILE CONFUCIANISM WITH RULE OF LAW. THE FIRST, BUT UNDESIRABLE, APPROACH IS WHAT I CALL THE 'CONFUCIANISATION OF RULE OF LAW' WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY LEGAL-MORALIST IN CHARACTER. INSTEAD, I CONTEND THAT THE SECOND APPROACH, 'CONFUCIAN SELF-RESTRAINT', IS THE BETTER OPTION NOT ONLY FOR AVOIDING CREATING AN OPPRESSIVE SOCIETY, BUT ALSO FOR ADVANCING THE CONFUCIAN IDEAL OF GENERAL MORAL CULTIVATION.
120	DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ARE COMPLEMENTARY CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES, NOT POSSIBLE SEPARATELY. CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF ITS SHORTCOMINGS IS ACCEPTABLE, BUT THE AFFIRMATION OF ITS FAILURE THREATENS THE LEGITIMACY OF ESSENTIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR SOCIAL COEXISTENCE. THE ACADEMIC APPROACHES THAT CONFRONT DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW FAVOR AUTHORITARIAN REACTIONS OF AN EXTREMIST NATURE, IN A CONTEXT OF GROWING SOCIAL POLARIZATION AND RISK OF BREAKDOWN OF DEMOCRACY. THUS, JURISTS SHOULD PROVIDE SOLUTIONS, AND SHOW COURAGE AND BOLDNESS IN UPHOLDING CORE VALUES. ALSO, SHOULD REMEMBER THAT COUNTERMAJORITY BALANCES OFFSET SIDE EFFECTS OF POLARIZATION.
121	I PRESENT A SIMPLE MODEL OF TWO REPRESENTATIVE FIRMS EMBEDDED IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF INSTITUTIONALIZED GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. ONE FIRM HAS ACCESS TO FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, BUT THAT ACCESS IS LIMITED BY THE QUALITY OF RULE OF LAW IN THE ECONOMY. I USE THE MODEL TO EXPLORE THE QUESTION, ADDRESSED IN RECENT ECONOMIC LITERATURE, OF WHETHER OR NOT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT REDUCES CORRUPTION. I SHOW THAT CORRUPTION MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPENDING ON THE INTERACTION OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND RULE OF LAW. FURTHER, I SHOW THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORRUPT GOVERNMENTAL BUREAUCRACY MAY INCREASE CORRUPT REVENUE BY INCREASING THE QUALITY OF LEGAL PROTECTION.
122	THIS STUDY EXAMINES WHETHER AND HOW DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW-TWO OVERARCHING COUNTRY-LEVEL GOVERNANCE VARIABLES-INFLUENCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. GIVEN THAT CORPORATE LIQUIDITY (CASH HOLDINGS) IS A GOOD CHANNEL FOR EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, THE EFFECTS OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CAN BE IDENTIFIED USING THE LIQUIDITY APPROACH. A REVIEW OF 67 COUNTRIES FROM 1996 TO 2010 DEMONSTRATES THAT DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW INDEED HAVE BEARINGS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, RESULTS INDICATE THAT FIRMS ARE MORE INCLINED TO HOARD CASH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IS HIGHER OR RULE OF LAW IS STRONGER, SUGGESTING THAT AGENCY COSTS ARE LOWER AND INTERESTS OF MANAGERS AND SHAREHOLDERS ARE MORE ALIGNED UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DEBT ISSUANCE AND DIVIDEND PAYMENT ON CASH IS MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IS HIGHER OR RULE OF LAW IS STRONGER, SUGGESTING THAT THESE TWO APPROACHES BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING AGENCY COSTS AND TRANSITIVELY CASH HOLDINGS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. MOREOVER, THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE APPEARS TO BE REINFORCED WHEN RULE OF LAW IS STRONGER AND THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY IS HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, HIGHER LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HELPS REAP THE BENEFIT OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF IMPROVING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND REDUCING AGENCY COSTS.
123	CONFUCIANISM AS THE OLD IDEOLOGY HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR A LONG TIME FROM THE OFFICIAL POINT OF VIEW IN CHINA; HOWEVER, ITS CORE VALUE IS STILL INFLUENCING CHINESE SOCIETY. ON THE WAY TOWARDS ROAD OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONFUCIANISM IS CONSIDERED PLAYING THE NEGATIVE ROLE. IT IS NECESSARY TO STUDY THE FRAMEWORK OF CONFUCIANISM SYSTEMATICALLY SO AS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE RULE OF LAW SHOWS DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN CHINA AND WESTERN WORLD, AND WHY CHINESE WOULD RATHER RESOLVE DISPUTES IN CONFUCIANISM WAY THAN THE RULE OF LAW. I WILL DISCUSS THE THINKING WAY OF CONFUCIANISM, ANALYZE ITS CORE VALUE AND THE RELATION BETWEEN CONFUCIANISM AND THE RULE OF LAW, THROUGH WHICH GET TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CONFUCIANISM VALUE HAS THE INCLINATION TO AVOID THE LAW.
124	THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ONLY A SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR NATIONAL LEGISLATION BUT ALSO FUNCTIONS AS EXPORT-PRODUCT, REQUIRING THE GOVERNMENTS OF FRAGILE OR FAILED STATES TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE LIKE. THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS OF HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS CONCEPTUALIZED IN THIS CONTEXT, AND DEVELOPS SOME HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH RELATIONS BETWEEN DONOR COUNTRIES AND RECEIVING COUNTRIES RISK ACHIEVING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS INTENDED.
125	TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MEASURES ARE FREQUENTLY EXPECTED TO HELP PROMOTE PEACE IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES, THROUGH MEASURES THAT RELY HEAVILY UPON LEGAL OR LEGALIZED PROCESSES SUCH AS TRIALS AND COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY. THEY ARE ALSO OFTEN EXPECTED TO INFLUENCE OR PROMOTE REFORM IN LEGAL PROCESSES AND INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING THE JUDICIARY, THE CONSTITUTION, AND LEGISLATION, IN WAYS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HELP PROMOTE PEACE IN FUTURE POST-CONFLICT STATES. HOWEVER, NOT ONLY IS THE EVIDENCE OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN PROMOTING PEACE THROUGH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE A MIXED ONE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE EMPHASIS ON TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE OFTEN OVERLOOKS THE WAYS IN WHICH LAW IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A ROLE IN PROMOTING PEACE MORE BROADLY AND IN WAYS INTERTWINED WITH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, THROUGH RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, OFTEN BY INTERNATIONAL ACTORS, AND THROUGH PEACE AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNANCE MEASURES, INCLUDING POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. THESE RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNANCE MEASURES SIMILARLY HAVE A MIXED RECORD WITH REGARD TO THEIR EFFECTS FOR EITHER SHORT-OR LONG-TERM PEACE. CLOSER ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF LAW AND LEGALIZED MECHANISMS IN PRODUCING OR SUPPORTING PEACE IS NEEDED, INCLUDING ANALYSIS OF THE TYPES OF LAW AND MECHANISMS DEPLOYED. DRAWING ON FIELDWORK IN SIERRA LEONE, UGANDA, COLOMBIA, KENYA, SRI LANKA, AND SUDAN, AMONG OTHERS, THIS PAPER WILL ELABORATE ON THE CHALLENGES OF USING LAW FOR PEACE VIA GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW MEASURES, AS WELL AS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
126	HEATED DEBATES OVER HEALTHCARE POLICY IN THE UNITED STATES POINT TO THE NEED FOR A LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT CAN SUSTAIN BOTH MORAL DIVERSITY AND PEACEFUL COOPERATION. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CLASSICAL LIBERAL RULE OF LAW, WITH ITS FOUNDATION IN THE ETHICAL PRINCIPLE OF PERMISSION, IS SUCH A FRAMEWORK. THE PAPER SHOWS TO WHAT EXTENT THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE POLICY LANDSCAPE IN THE UNITED STATES DIVERGES FROM THE RULE OF LAW AND SUGGESTS HOW THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK COULD BE MODIFIED IN ORDER TO BETTER APPROXIMATE THAT IDEAL. TWO OBJECTIONS ARE THEN ANSWERED. THE FIRST IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW CANNOT BE REALIZED DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF LEGISLATURES. THE SECOND OBJECTION IS THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD GUARANTEE BOTH LIBERTY AND ALL OF THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS OF AUTONOMY.
127	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND INFLATION. ANNUAL DATA FOR THE PERIOD OF 2013-2019 OF THE RULE OF LAW INDEX FROM THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT (WJP) FOR 40 COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA WERE USED. BY MEANS OF CROSS-SECTION ESTIMATES AND PANEL DATA USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL (RE), THE DEPENDENCE OF INFLATION ON INDIVIDUAL WJP SUB-INDICES WAS EMPIRICALLY ESTIMATED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A WIDE ANALYTICAL SPECTRUM OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. RECENTLY, THE ISSUE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS INCREASINGLY USED IN ECONOMIC RESEARCH. FIRST OF ALL, IT CONCERNS THE DEPENDENCE OF TRANSACTION FUNDS AND TRUST ON LEGAL FACTORS, WHICH HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE FUNDS OF PRODUCTION AND INFLATION, AS EMPHASIZED BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL SCHOOL (NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS). INSTEAD, NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS MAINLY ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW MECHANISMS ON THE FORMATION OF TRUST IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS AS THE INDEPENDENT CENTRAL BANK OR THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS. THERE IS NO LACK OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT THE ANTI-INFLATIONARY INFLUENCE OF THE CENTRAL BANK SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDS ON THE CONCOMITANT CONDITIONS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS EXPERTS STATE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL AND REGULATORY NORMS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY WITH A LOW INTEREST RATE (ZERO LOWER BOUND - ZLB), WHICH HAS BEEN THE CASE RECENTLY IN MOST INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. SINCE THE ACADEMIC INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS QUITE BROAD, IT IS OF PRACTICAL INTEREST TO STUDY THE RELEVANT MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS IN TERMS OF SUCH INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS AS THE SYSTEM OF COUNTERBALANCES AND CHECKS FOR GOVERNMENT, THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, MAINTENANCE OF LAW AND ORDER, EFFICIENCY OF REGULATORY MECHANISMS, ETC. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE IS NO REASON TO DENY THE ANTI-INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL AND IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS, BUT THE OBTAINED EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES MAY BE VULNERABLE TO DATA AGGREGATION AND DIFFER IN TERMS OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS OF COUNTRIES. IF WE USE THE GENERAL INDEX OF THE RULE OF LAW OF THE WJP, THE ANTI-INFLATIONARY EFFECT CAN BE TRACED BOTH FOR THE GENERAL SAMPLE OF 40 COUNTRIES, AND SEPARATELY FOR BOTH SUBGROUPS OF COUNTRIES: 1) CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE) AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, 2) ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA. THE USE OF WJP SUB-INDICES SHOWS AN ANTI-INFLATIONARY EFFECT FOR THE GENERAL SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES AND SUBGROUPS OF CEE COUNTRIES AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION (WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS), BUT THE CORRESPONDING EFFECT IS COMPLETELY LOST FOR THE COUNTRIES OF ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA (IT CAN MEAN THAT ONLY COMPLEX SIMULTANEOUS INTRODUCTION OF ALL COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ANTI-INFLATIONARY). THIS FEATURE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ERRONEOUS USE OF PANEL DATA ESTIMATES FOR LARGE GROUPS OF COUNTRIES THAT MAY NOT MEET CERTAIN REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND INCLINE TO ERRONEOUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ECONOMIC POLICY. AMONG OTHER RESULTS, WEAK SIGNS OF ACCELERATING INFLATION HAVE BEEN OBSERVED OVER TIME IN THE CEE COUNTRIES AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, BUT NOT IN ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA. ALSO IN THESE COUNTRIES, INFLATION DOES NOT DEPEND ON GDP DYNAMICS. IN CONTRAST, IN THE CEE AND FORMER SOVIET UNION COUNTRIES, ON AVERAGE, EACH PERCENTAGE POINT OF GDP GROWTH (LAG PER YEAR) IS MARKED BY A 0.3-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN INFLATION.
128	THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES THAT THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL INTEREST PERCEPTION THAT EXPLAIN ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE FIRST LEVEL, "PROFIT," REFERS TO TANGIBLE INDIVIDUAL GAIN, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF ECONOMIC ENRICHMENT OR THE ACCUMULATION OF POLITICAL POWER. THE SECOND LAYER OF INTEREST, "PERSUASION," INVOLVES SOCIAL NORMS AND REPUTATION. IN THIS SECOND LEVEL, INDIVIDUALS ADHERE TO A RULE NOT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF GOVERNMENT SANCTION OR REWARD, BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF INTANGIBLE CONCERNS FOR REPUTATION AND SOCIAL STATUS. FINALLY, THE THIRD LAYER OF INTEREST INVOLVES INDIVIDUALS FORGOING TANGIBLE BENEFIT FOR THE SAKE OF FIDELITY TO A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER OR A SHARED SET OF BELIEFS. A POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OF THE THREE-INTEREST VIEW IS THAT IT PROVIDES FOR AN ACCESSIBLE DESCRIPTIVE FRAMEWORK THAT CAPTURES THE BROAD NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW, MOVING FROM THE SMALL BRIBE FOR A LOCAL OFFICIAL TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A CONSTITUTION WILL CONSTRAIN THE POWERFUL. THE THREE-INTEREST VIEW ALSO ALIGNS WELL WITH MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS AND SUGGESTS FUTURE LINES OF RESEARCH INTO HOW INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS NAVIGATE FROM SELF-INTEREST TOWARD COOPERATION AND FIDELITY.
129	ONE OF THE MAXIMS OF CRIMINAL LAW ORTHODOXY STATES THAT A DEFENDANT'S MOTIVE FOR OFFENDING, BE IT GOOD OR BAD, SHOULD HAVE NO WEIGHT IN ASSESSING HIS OR HER CRIMINAL LIABILITY-ALTHOUGH IT MAY RIGHTFULLY BEAR ON THE PUNISHMENT IMPOSED. KNOWN AS THE "IRRELEVANCE OF MOTIVE PRINCIPLE,'' THIS IDEA OWES MUCH OF ITS POPULAR STATURE IN LEGAL THINKING TO ARGUMENTS THAT DRAW ON THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS SAID THAT ALLOWING DEFENDANTS' MOTIVES TO GENERATE OR NEGATE THEIR CRIMINAL LIABILITY WOULD UNDERMINE THE STATE'S AUTHORITY IN DEFINING THE CONTOURS OF CRIME. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND CRITICALLY EXAMINES THREE STREAMS OF SUCH ARGUMENTS, AND THESE IN TURN LEAD TO THREE FINDINGS. FIRST, EACH MANIFESTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARGUMENT DEFENDS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF THE IRRELEVANCE PRINCIPLE; THIS MEANS THAT DESPITE THE COMMON ALLUSION TO THE IRRELEVANCE PRINCIPLE, THERE IS NO SINGULAR PRINCIPLE, BUT INSTEAD SEVERAL VARIANTS OF THE NORM ARE AT PLAY. SECONDLY, RULE OF LAW ARGUMENTS FAIL TO SUSTAIN ANY MEANINGFUL NOTION OF THE IRRELEVANCE PRINCIPLE. FINALLY, THERE EXISTS A SPHERE OF INSTANCES WHERE THE CAREFUL APPLICATION OF MOTIVES TO CRIMINAL DIRECTIVES MAY ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW BY INFUSING LEGISLATION WITH ADDED CLARITY AND RICHNESS.
130	ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS IN A COORDINATED MANNER IS A SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC MEASURE PUT FORWARD BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AMID GLOBAL CHANGES OF A MAGNITUDE NOT SEEN IN A CENTURY. IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONTENT OF XI JINPING THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ALSO A NEW PRACTICE FACING CHINA'S HIGH- LEVEL OPENING UP. TO FURTHER EXPLORE AND CLARIFY THE BASIC THEORY AND APPROACH OF CULTIVATING HIGH-QUALITY TALENTS IN THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS, THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES AND SUMMARIZES THE PRACTICE OF FOREIGN-RELATED RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALIZATION. THIS IS DONE FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF TERRITORY, NORMATIVE, SUBJECT, AND LEGAL APPLICATION DIMENSIONS. KEY FACTORS INCLUDE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN OFFICIAL LANGUAGES AND LEGAL CULTURES BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS, THE CLOSURE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ADMISSION MECHANISMS, AND THE INTER-DISCIPLINARY REQUIREMENTS FOR TALENTS PRATICING THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGNRELATED AFFAIRS. FOR THIS REASON, THE PATH FOR TALENT CULTIVATION IN THIS FIELD IN CHINA FOR THE NEW ERA CAN BE EXPLORED THROUGH CLARIFYING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION, STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, AND BUILDING A MULTI-LEVEL MECHANISM FOR THE CULTIVATION AND UTILIZATION OF TALENTS PRACTICING THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS.
131	IN 1885 A.V. DICEY IDENTIFIED THE RULE OF LAW AS A KEY PRINCIPLE OF BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. PRESENTING IT BOTH AS A PRODUCT OF ENGLISH COMMON LAW METHOD AND AN EXPRESSION OF CLASSICAL LIBERALISM, DICEY'S CONCEPT LINGERED ON INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY BUT MAINLY AS A CONTENTIOUS IDEOLOGICAL DOCTRINE OR SIMPLY AS A VAGUE RHETORICAL SLOGAN. DURING THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, HOWEVER, THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN REVIVED, RECRAFTED, RELOCATED AND REIFIED. THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME A UNIVERSAL TROPE, ALBEIT WITH A RANGE OF CONTESTABLE MEANINGS. THIS ARTICLE TRACES THIS DEVELOPMENT, SHOWING HOW IT HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A PHRASE OF CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL POTENCY NOT ONLY DOMESTICALLY BUT ALSO IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA.
132	IMMIGRANT LEGALIZATION POLICIES POSE AN ETHICAL DILEMMA BETWEEN JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE ONE HAND, LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ASPIRE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND EQUALITY. BUILDING ON LIBERAL IDEALS OF JUSTICE, COMPELLING ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR GRANTING LEGAL STATUS AND A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP TO UNAUTHORIZED MIGRANTS BY VIRTUE OF THE SOCIAL TIES THEY HAVE DEVELOPED, THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOST SOCIETY, AND THEIR VULNERABILITY TO EXPLOITATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, LEGALIZATION POSES A CHALLENGE TO ANOTHER IMPORTANT VALUE, THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH REQUIRES GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF LAW IN ACCORDANCE WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED PUBLIC NORMS. IMMIGRANT LEGALIZATION PROGRAMMES ARE SAID TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE THEY REWARD LAWBREAKING, ALLOW QUEUE-JUMPING, AND INCENTIVIZE FURTHER UNAUTHORIZED MIGRATION. THIS ARTICLE CLARIFIES EACH HORN OF THE DILEMMA, FOCUSING ON RULE OF LAW ARGUMENTS. WE OFFER A CRITICAL REAPPRAISAL OF IMMIGRANT LEGALIZATION POLICIES BY REFLECTING ON THE NORMATIVE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND BY EXAMINING EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF LEGALIZATION. OUR CENTRAL CONTENTION IS THAT LEGALIZATION POLICIES CAN ENHANCE THE RULE OF LAW. WE OFFER FIVE RULE OF LAW ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF LEGALIZATION, WHICH HELP TO MITIGATE THE DILEMMA BETWEEN JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW. WE CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR ANALYSIS.
133	THE RULE OF LAW IS A MORAL IDEAL THAT PROTECTS DISTINCTIVE LEGAL VALUES SUCH AS GENERALITY, EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW, THE INDEPENDENCE OF COURTS, AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. I ARGUE THAT ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF THE LAW IS THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL AND STATE AUTONOMY FROM THE ARBITRARY INTERFERENCE OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THAT THE BEST WAY TO CODIFY THIS PROTECTION IS THROUGH CONSTITUTIONAL RULES RESTRAINING THE REACH OF INTERNATIONAL LAW INTO THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF A STATE. STATE AUTONOMY DOES NOT HAVE ANY INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORAL STATUS OF ITS OWN. ITS VALUE IS DERIVATIVE, RESULTING FROM THE ROLE IT PLAYS AS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF PROTECTING AUTONOMY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. THEREFORE, THE GOAL OF PROTECTING STATE AUTONOMY FORM THE ENCROACHMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WILL HAVE TO BE CONSTRAINED BY, AND BALANCED AGAINST THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE PROTECTION OF THE AUTONOMY OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONS, BEST REALIZED THROUGH THE ENTRENCHMENT OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS.
134	IT IS WIDELY ASSUMED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS ESSENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW IS CLEARLY A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONCEPT, ENCOMPASSING A VARIETY OF DISCRETE COMPONENTS FROM SECURITY OF PERSON AND PROPERTY RIGHTS, TO CHECKS ON GOVERNMENT AND CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. WE REVIEW THE THEORY UNDERLYING THESE DIFFERENT CAUSAL MECHANISMS LINKING THE RULE OF LAW TO ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND PROVIDE AN INTRODUCTION TO SOME OUTSTANDING MEASUREMENT ISSUES. WE FIND THAT THE CORRELATION AMONG DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT ARE NOT TIGHT AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THAT SOME INFERENCES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION MAY NOT BE WARRANTED.

135	A PRESSING FOCUS FOR ALL LEGAL SYSTEMS IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE JUDICIAL INVOCATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LEGISLATIVE OUTPUT OF REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS. THIS ARTICLE PRIMARILY CENTRES ON THE CANADIAN EXPERIENCE. AFTER THE INTRODUCTION, I LOOK AT SOME OF THE GRANDER AND MORE JURISPRUDENTIAL EFFORTS AT GROUNDING THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF LEGAL AUTHORITY. NEXT, I LOOK AT THE WORK OF THE SUPREME COURT IN IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONSTITUTIONAL MATTERS. IN THE FOURTH SECTION, I CONSIDER THE MOST RECENT DECISIONS OF THAT COURT TO GIVE SUBSTANCE AND MEANING TO THE RULE OF LAW IN RESPONDING TO LEGISLATIVE OVER-STEPPING. IN THE FIFTH SECTION, I GO BACK TO AN OLDER CASE TO ILLUMINATE THE BASIC CONUNDRUM THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF JUDICIAL EFFORTS TO BOTH ANIMATE AND LIMIT THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTROLLING LEGISLATIVE OR ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING. THROUGHOUT, MY MAIN AMBITION WILL BE TO EXAMINE AND EVALUATE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDGES AND LEGISLATORS IN ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW.
136	DEVELOPMENTS IN HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AFTER 2010 SUGGEST THAT THE ERA IN HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONALISM CHARACTERIZED BY A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN REPLACED BY AN ERA WHERE THE LAW IS REGARDED AS AN INSTRUMENT AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT TO RULE. UNDER THE NEW FUNDAMENTAL LAW, WHICH PLACES ALIKE THE 1989 CONSTITUTION THE RULE OF LAW AT THE CENTRE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN HABITUALLY OVERRIDDEN OR IGNORED BY THE GOVERNMENT ACTING IN PARLIAMENT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S ATTEMPTS TO CONTINUE THE LEGACY OF PRE-2010 CONSTITUTIONALISM WERE REPROACHED BY THE GOVERNMENT DELIMITING THE POWERS OF THE COURT OR OVERRULING ITS DECISIONS IN FORMAL AMENDMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT. IN THE DOMAIN OF ECONOMIC REGULATION, THE DIFFERENCES IN HOW THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND EUROPEAN JUDICIAL FORA ASSESS THE LEGAL MEASURES WHICH HAVE RESTRUCTURED ENTIRE MARKETS GIVE A CLEAR INDICATION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY HAS LOST ITS PREVIOUS ENJOYED POSITION IN THE HUNGARIAN CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER.
137	FOLLOWING KOSOVO'S DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE EUROPEAN UNION DEPLOYED A RULE OF LAW MISSION IN KOSOVO (EULEX). WHILE EULEX AND ITS SUPPORTERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE MISSION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUCCEED, CRITICS CLAIM THAT THE MISSION HAS FAILED TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE KOSOVO'S RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS, TO ADDRESS THE RULE OF LAW VACUUM IN THE NORTH OF KOSOVO, AND TO PROSECUTE HIGH-LEVEL ORGANIZED CRIME AND CORRUPTION. I ARGUE THAT THE CRITICS ARE CORRECT, AND EXPLAIN THAT THE MISSION IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED DUE TO ITS NEUTRALITY ABOUT KOSOVO'S INDEPENDENCE, ITS REJECTION OF CONDITIONALITY AND CAPACITY BUILDING, AND ITS DIFFICULTY INVESTIGATING POLITICIZED CRIMES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MISSION CANNOT OVERCOME THE INHERENT CHALLENGES OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN KOSOVO, NAMELY THE DESIRE OF THE KOSOVO ALBANIAN MAJORITY FOR INDEPENDENCE AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN POLITICS AND CRIMINALITY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT EULEX SHOULD NOT BE RENEWED, SINCE THE MISSION'S MAIN FUNCTIONS COULD BE BETTER FULFILLED BY OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, NAMELY THE NATO-LED KOSOVO FORCE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION OFFICE.
138	BASED ON INGLEHART'S AND SCHWARTZ'S VALUES THEORIES, THE POLITICAL CULTURE APPROACH, PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE DETERMINANTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND DATA FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY AND A VARIETY OF SOURCES, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES, USING A SAMPLE OF 83 COUNTRIES, THE INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL VARIABLES ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS RELATIVE IMPORTANCE IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER FACTORS, LIKE INCOME, TYPE OF LEGAL SYSTEM AND POLITICAL HISTORY. IT ALSO COMPARES THE SITUATION OF ARGENTINA AND LATIN AMERICA IN A WORLDWIDE PERSPECTIVE. THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, INCLUDING A SET OF REGRESSION MODELS, STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN OUR COUNTRY AND REGION DERIVE TO A LARGE EXTENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE VALUES SYSTEMS LINKED TO INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND EGALITARIANISM ARE STILL NOT ENOUGH WIDESPREAD IN OUR SOCIETIES.
139	ON 16 AUGUST 2102, 34 STRIKING MINERS WERE KILLED BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE SERVICE AT A PLATINUM MINE IN MARIKANA IN THE NORTH-WEST OF SOUTH AFRICA. THE MASSACRE RECALLED THE KIND OF VIOLENCE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED WITH THE END OF APARTHEID IN 1994. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE MASSACRE OCCURRED, THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS POLICED, AND DRAWS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT GOVERNANCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA. THE MARIKANA COMMISSION OF INQUIRY APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA CONCLUDED THAT THE KILLINGS WERE NOT JUSTIFIED AND THAT THE POLICE HAD ENGAGED IN A COVER UP. POLICE VIOLENCE AND A LACK OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY TURN THE LOGIC OF THE RULE OF LAW ON ITS HEAD. THERE HAS BEEN A PATTERN OF IMPUNITY AND INDIFFERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW DURING ZUMA'S PRESIDENCY THAT IS SYMPTOMATIC OF A LOSS OF DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY THAT THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH AFRICA'S VIOLENT DEMOCRACY.
140	THE BACKGROUND CONDITIONS FOR THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT BUT UNDERDEVELOPED. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES CURRENT THEORIES OF THE ORIGIN OF THE RULE OF LAW, ARGUING THAT THEY ARE USEFUL BUT INCOMPLETE. IN ADDITION TO THOSE THEORIES, THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS GOD'S IMAGE BEARERS IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE RULE OF LAW IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION. THE FORMULATION OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN EQUALITY IS NOT, HOWEVER, A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE CONCEPT HAS TAKEN CENTURIES OF ARTICULATION IN DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS AND SOCIAL SETTINGS. IT ONLY REACHED FULL FRUITION WHEN IT WAS JOINED WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF APPROPRIATE LEGAL AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS AS EXPRESSED BY POLITICAL THEORISTS SUCH AS LOCKE, MONTESQUIEU, AND MADISON.
141	THIS PAPER SURVEYS THE LEGAL TRADITION THAT LINKS MAGNA CARTA WITH THE MODERN CONCEPTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT. IT DOCUMENTS THAT THE ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW INCLUDED SUBSTANTIVE COMMITMENTS TO INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND LIMITED GOVERNMENT. THEN, IT ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY SUCH COMMITMENTS WERE LOST TO A FORMALIST INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW FROM 1848 TO 1939. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT A REVIVAL OF THE SUBSTANTIVE COMMITMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS CENTRAL TO RESHAPING MODERN STATES. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
142	TALK OF THE RULE OF LAW IS TODAY UBIQUITOUS IN MYANMAR. BUT WHAT DOES THE RULE OF LAW MEAN? AND WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE COUNTRY'S NASCENT DEMOCRATIZATION? ONE WAY TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE RULE OF LAW IS IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIVE LEGAL EQUALITY. BURMESE FARMERS AND ACTIVISTS MOBILIZING THROUGH THE LEXICON OF LAW TO DEFEND AGRICULTURAL LAND AGAINST INTRUSIVE STATE PROJECTS ENGAGE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS SENSE. ANOTHER WAY IS AS A LANGUAGE OF PUBLIC AND STATE SECURITY. DEMANDS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE IN MYANMAR'S WEST CORRESPOND WITH THIS USAGE. WHEREAS IN ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES THE RULE OF LAW AS EQUALITY COMPLEMENTS THE RULE OF LAW AS SECURITY, IN A DEMOCRATIZING STATE THE TWO ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPATIBLE. THE RULE OF LAW AS AN IDEA ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIVE LEGAL EQUALITY CONTRIBUTES TO MYANMAR'S DEMOCRATIZATION, WHEREAS WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC AND STATE SECURITY IT POTENTIALLY UNDERMINES THAT DEMOCRATIZATION.
143	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CENTRAL MECHANISM FOR THE DEFENSE OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND CONSEQUENT ACCESS TO DEMOCRACY, ACHIEVING WHAT WE CALL CONTINUOUS DEMOCRACY. AT FIRST, WE ANALYZE HOW THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1789 IMPACTED THE EMERGENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL MODERNITY BY ATTRIBUTING AUTONOMY TO THE BODY OF CITIZENS NOTABLY THROUGH THE PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. IN THE SECOND PART, WE DISCUSS HOW THE RULE OF LAW ASSUMES THE LINGUISTIC EXPRESSION OF SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS PRESENT IN SOCIETY, EVEN BEFORE BECOMING A GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE.
144	THIS CONTRIBUTION WILL FIRST OFFER A BACKGROUND OVERVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS BY OUTLINING ITS GENESIS BEFORE ADDRESSING SOME CONCEPTUAL ISSUES AND IN PARTICULAR, HOW THOSE UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO PREVENT EUROPEAN UNION ACTION BY CHALLENGING INTER ALIA THE BINDING NATURE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF EU RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS. POLAND WILL THEN BE USED AS A CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE THE REALITY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS.
145	IN THIS PAPER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS A ROBUST NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIZE OF COUNTRY TERRITORY AND A MEASURE OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR A LARGE CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES. WE OUTLINE A FRAMEWORK FEATURING TWO MAIN REASONS FOR THIS REGULARITY; FIRSTLY THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OFTEN HAS THE CHARACTER OF A LOCAL PUBLIC GOOD THAT IS IMPERFECTLY SPREAD ACROSS SPACE FROM THE CORE OF THE COUNTRY TO THE HINTERLAND, AND SECONDLY THAT A LARGE TERRITORY USUALLY IS ACCOMPANIED BY VALUABLE RENTS AND A LACK OF OPENNESS THAT BOTH TEND TO DISTORT PROPERTY RIGHTS INSTITUTIONS. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS FURTHER SHOWS SOME EVIDENCE THAT WHETHER THE CAPITAL IS CENTRALLY OR PERIPHERALLY LOCATED WITHIN THE COUNTRY MATTERS FOR THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW.

146	THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT OFFERING AN INNOVATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE POTENTIALITIES OF THE "RULE OF LAW" FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. IT GOES BEYOND CURRENT USES AND THE DISPUTE BETWEEN FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS BY EXPLORING THE ROOTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL IDEAL. ALSO THROUGH HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE CORE OF THE RULE OF LAW APPEARS TO BE A PECULIAR NOTION. IT DISPLAYS A SPECIAL OBJECTIVE THAT THE LAW IS ASKED TO ACHIEVE, ON A LEGAL PLANE, LARGELY INDEPENDENTLY OF POLITICAL INSTRUMENTALISM. THE NORMATIVE MEANING IS ELABORATED ON AND CONSTRUED AROUND NOTIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM, NON-DOMINATION AND "DUALITY" OF LAW. THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE CONSIDERED AS, FIRST, CONSISTENT WITH ITS HISTORICAL CONSTANTS, INSTEAD OF BEING FORGED ON PURELY ABSTRACT BASIS; SECOND, EXTENDABLE TO CONTEMPORARY INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS, BEYOND THE STATE; AND, THIRD, CONCEPTUALLY SUSTAINABLE ON A LEGAL THEORETICAL PLANE, WHERE IT IS LOCATED WITHOUT FALLING PREY TO THE DEBATE ABOUT THE MORALITY OF VALID LAW.
147	THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN KOREA OCCURRED WITH MUCH TURMOIL AND UNCERTAINTY, MUCH LIKE THE PATH TOWARDS DEMOCRACY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. HOWEVER, KOREAN RULE OF LAW AND ITS INTRICATE LINK TO KOREA'S OWN RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OFFER A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE THAT DEMONSTRATES THE VARIETY OF WAYS AND FORMS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW MAY BE ESTABLISHED. THIS PAPER WILL FIRST DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN KOREA AND THE MAJOR INFLUENCES THAT FACILITATED IT. THE LESSONS DRAWN FROM KOREA'S EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATE THAT WHILE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE OF LAW IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IS ADAPTED TO THE UNIQUE HISTORY AND NEEDS OF EACH NATION, THE SAME GENERAL ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE SHARED ACROSS VARIOUS CULTURES AND HAVE REMAINED CONSISTENT OVER TIME. MOREOVER, THE KOREAN CASE ILLUSTRATES THAT EVEN WHEN A SOCIETY MAKES REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW, DEEPLY ENTRENCHED DISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT AND LEGAL PROCESSES MAY BE A LEGACY THAT TAKES TIME TO OVERCOME.
148	TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL THE PROCESS OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-COMMUNIST EUROPE IS FACING SERIOUS CHALLENGES. THE ANALYSIS OF THIS PERIOD CLEARLY SHOWS THAT ORGANIZING FREE AND DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IS EASIER THAN CREATING CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS ARE OFTEN WEAK OR UNDERDEVELOPED, AND HENCE FAIL TO FULFILL THEIR ESSENTIAL FUNCTION, I.E. TO LIMIT THE ABUSE OF UNCONTROLLED STATE POWER. THE CURRENT RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN THE REGION ORIGINATES FROM CERTAIN STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF THE TRANSITION IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CURRENT DEMOCRATIC SETBACK IS A FAILURE OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EFFECTIVE STATE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH, TOGETHER WITH DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, FORM MODERN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THE REFORMERS IN THE REGION TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 'HOMEGROWN DEVELOPMENT' AND THE NEED TO ADAPT WESTERN MODELS TO LOCAL CONDITIONS AND NEEDS. MANY RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS CREATED DURING THE LAST 25 YEARS NEED FURTHER REFORMS. IT IS TIME FOR REAL DEMOCRATIC DELIBERATION AND EXPERIMENTATION, WHICH COULD USHER IN MUCH NEEDED INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN THE REGION. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS, WE MUST NOT START FROM SOME IDEALIZED 'BEST MODEL', BUT FROM THE EXISTING CONTEXT IN WHICH THESE INSTITUTIONS FUNCTION. NEW RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS IN CEE MAY IN THE END RESEMBLE THEIR WESTERN MODELS. BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WORK WELL FOR CEE, EVEN IF THEY LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THEIR WESTERN COUNTERPARTS.
149	THE PRACTICE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW NEEDS A THEORETICAL GUIDE, AND THE FORMULATION OF THE THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS TO DEPEND UPON PRACTICE, WHICH IMPOSES NEW REQUIREMENT UPON THE METHODOLOGY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. TRADITIONAL RESEARCH INTO LEGAL DOCTRINE IS UNFAVORABLE TO THE CREATIVE EXERTION OF INTERNATIONAL JURISPRUDENCE, AND THE RESEARCH METHODS OF SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE PLAYING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PROMOTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW NEEDS TO DEEP RESEARCH A STATE'S MOTIVES, CAUSE AND INNATE LOGIC IN OBSERVING INTERNATIONAL AW, AND LAW AND ECONOMICS CAN SHOW ITS CAPABILITY IN THIS FIELD. FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, BASIC RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CARRIED ABOUT SUCH SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AS WHERE THE RULES ARE PRODUCED AND APPLIED AND EXERTING INFLUENCES. THE RESEARCH METHOD OF THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAW EXACTLY HITS THE POINT. THE APPLICATION OF EMPIRICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH METHODS OFFERS A BEFOREHAND "REHEARSAL" CHANCE FOR THE PROCESS OF THE RULE OF LAW TO GRASP THE PROS AND CONS IN THE PLANNING AND PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE RESEARCH METHODS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND THE TRADITIONAL RESEARCH METHOD OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN REASONABLY INTERPRET THE PHENOMENA OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND PROMOTE THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
150	FOR KANT AND MANY MODERN COSMOPOLITANS, ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDES THE CHIEF MECHANISM FOR ACHIEVING A JUST GLOBAL ORDER. YET, AS HART AND RAWLS HAVE ARGUED, THE RULE OF LAW, AS IT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD, IS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH "GREAT INIQUITIES." THIS CRITICISM DOES NOT APPLY TO A SUFFICIENTLY ROBUST, REPUBLICAN CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH ATTRIBUTES A BASIC LEGAL STATUS TO ALL PERSONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE PERVASIVENESS OF DOMINATED PERSONS WITHOUT LEGAL STATUS IS A A FUNDAMENTAL VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS LEGAL STATUS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN KANT'S SENSE AS AN ORIGINAL "RIGHT TO FREEDOM," ONE THAT IS NOT DERIVED FROM OR ACQUIRED BY MEMBERSHIP IN A COMMUNITY OR FROM CITIZENSHIP. THE REALIZATION OF THIS KIND OF LEGAL STATUS CAN ALREADY BE FOUND IN THE " COSMOPOLITAN CONSTITUTIONS" OF MANY DEMOCRACIES, WHICH INCLUDE RIGHTS OF PERSONS (AND NOT JUST CITIZENS) TO HABEAS CORPUS AND OTHER STATUSES THAT PROTECT THOSE VULNERABLE TO DOMINATION. IN ORDER THAT ALL PERSONS HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INSTITUTIONAL SPACE WITHIN WHICH TO EXERCISE THE POWERS OF PERSONS TO ADDRESS AND MAKE CLAIMS, INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS TO WHICH THOSE WHO LACK LEGAL STATUS CAN APPEAL AND BE RECOGNIZED ARE NECESSARY FOR A FORM OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS ADEQUATE TO CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
151	RECENT EUROPEAN EVENTS HAVE REVEALED THAT SOME EU MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING SOME SOUTH EASTERN EUROPEAN (SEE) STATES, STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE CERTAIN RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES MAY BE DUE TO PAST LEGACIES AND INSUFFICIENT (OR INSUFFICIENTLY SUCCESSFUL) TRANSITIONS, OTHERS MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE TRANSITION ITSELF AND OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT ARE EXPERIENCED ACROSS EUROPE. THIS ARTICLE WILL ADDRESS THE STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SEE, REFLECTING FIRST ON SOME PRE-, MID-, AND POST-TRANSITION PROBLEMS RELEVANT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THESE COUNTRIES. NEXT, IT WILL ADDRESS THE LEGAL AND SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE MENTIONED PROBLEMS, CONNECTING THE (MIS) TRUST THAT CAN BE OBSERVED ON SEVERAL LEVELS (INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY) WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THUS DEMONSTRATING THAT MISTRUST AS SUCH HAS SOCIAL AS WELL AS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. IF TRUST (E.G. IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS OR IN THOSE WHO ARE ENTRUSTED WITH SAFEGUARDING IT) IS LACKING, THIS REPRESENTS A PROBLEM NOT ONLY FOR THE MEMBER STATE (E.G. FOR THE FUNCTIONING AND PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF ITS JUDICIAL SYSTEM) IN QUESTION, BUT ALSO FOR THE EU (E.G. FOR THE JUDICIAL COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS). LASTLY, THE ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE THE EU'S PERSPECTIVE ON RULE OF LAW, DRAWING ON THE RECENT EU FRAMEWORK TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH AIMS TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE AND COHERENT PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ALL MEMBER STATES, AS WELL AS ON SOME OTHER EU DOCUMENTS THAT MAY, IN OUR VIEW, HELP ADDRESS THE CURRENT CHALLENGES IN EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW.
152	IN THIS ARTICLE WE ARGUE THAT RULE OF LAW INDICES ARE A POWERFUL TOOL TO DETECT ILLS IN THE RULE OF LAW OF EU MEMBER STATES. IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HOW TO IMPROVE THE INDICES' POTENTIAL, WE GIVE A CRITICAL OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES OF THE FOUR RULE OF LAW INDICES WHICH WE CONSIDER PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE FOR OUR PURPOSE. THESE ARE THE INDICES PROVIDED BY THE FREEDOM HOUSE ("FREEDOM IN THE WORLD," FIW), THE BERTELSMANN STIFTUNG ("BERTELSMANN TRANSFORMATION INDEX," BTI), THE WORLD BANK ("WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS," WGI), AND THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT ("RULE OF LAW INDEX," WJP RLI). AFTER ANALYZING THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THESE INDICES, WE TURN TO THE EU JUSTICE SCOREBOARD (EUJS). WHILE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EUJS IN 2013 HAS ALREADY BEEN AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ORDER TO LAY THE GROUND FOR AN EU-WIDE ANALYSIS, IN THIS ARTICLE WE SUGGEST HOW THE EUJS SHOULD BE FURTHER DEVELOPED INTO A PROPER RULE OF LAW INDEX BY AGGREGATING EXPERT OPINIONS INTO A SINGLE NUMBER. THIS WOULD MAKE THE EUJS A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE USEFUL TOOL IN THE ONGOING EU RULE OF LAW CRISIS.
153	WHAT ROLE DO COURTS PLAY IN ADVANCING OR UPHOLDING THE POLITICAL IDEAL THAT WE CALL 'THE RULE OF LAW'? DOES THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRE THAT COURTS SHOULD HAVE AUTHORITY OVER ALL OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE? AND DOES IT IMPOSE CONSTRAINTS ON THE SORT OF REASONING AND DECISION-MAKING THAT COURTS ENGAGE IN? THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES AN ARRAY OF POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, AND CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ASCENDANCY OF COURTS IN A CONSTITUTION MAY REPRESENT A FORM OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY THAT LOOKS REMARKABLY LIKE THE UNCONTROLLED RULE OF MEN, WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT. TO PRECLUDE THAT POSSIBILITY, IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR COURTS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR AUTHORITY IS LIMITED IN SCOPE AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE GUIDED BY ANY OVERALL POLITICAL PROGRAM OTHER THAN THE PROGRAM OF SEEING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON GOVERNMENT ARE UPHELD.
154	DRAFTERS OF LEGISLATION OCCUPY AN IMPORTANT POSITION OF CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE, INVOLVING THE TRANSLATION OF POLITICAL WILL INTO LEGAL FORM. THEY HELP CLARIFY AND REFINE THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM POLITICIANS AND CREATE STATUTORY SCHEMES WHICH ARE INTERNALLY COHERENT AND HAVE EXTERNAL COHERENCE WITH WIDER LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES. THEY BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DISCIPLINING AND REFINING POLITICAL WILL THROUGH APPLICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL REASON, WHICH IS THEN CONTINUED AT THE STAGE OF INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES BY THE COURTS. DRAFTERS OF LEGISLATION THUS CONTRIBUTE TO THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW VALUES OF PREDICTABILITY AND CERTAINTY AND ALSO TO MORE SUBSTANTIVE VALUES OF FAIRNESS AND RESPECT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES AND RIGHTS. THE BETTER THE DRAFTING OF LEGISLATION, THE SMOOTHER THE INTEGRATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE LESS NEED THERE IS FOR INTERSTITIAL LAW-MAKING BY JUDGES IN THE INTERPRETIVE EXERCISE.
155	THIS ARTICLE DEALS WITH THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW IN THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT. AUTHORS ANALYSE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE TOPIC FROM THE VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW. THE RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON FINDING, WHETHER AND HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS APPLIED IN THE PROCESS OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, AND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR ITS BREACH.
156	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE MUTUALLY REINFORCING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECTING UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY. ACADEMIC FREEDOM AS RECOGNISED IN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW CAN BE DECONSTRUCTED INTO TWO INTER-CONNECTED DIMENSIONS: AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AND INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY OF UNIVERSITIES AND THE RULE OF LAW IS A MUTUALLY REINFORCING ONE, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE SITUATION IN HUNGARY, POLAND AND RUSSIA. THIS RELATIONSHIP MANIFESTS IN TWO DISTINCT WAYS. FIRSTLY, THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY IS NOT THREATENED BY ARBITRARY AND UNTRAMMELED EXERCISE OF STATE POWER. SECONDLY, THIS AUTONOMY, IN TURN SUPPORTS AND STRENGTHENS THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE STATE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM IN HUNGARY, POLAND AND RUSSIA, WE NEED TO CONSIDER THIS BIDIRECTIONAL LINK BETWEEN INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY OF UNIVERSITIES AND THE RULE OF LAW.
157	IN THIS ARTICLE, I CONSIDER HOW FEARS OF THE FUTURE OPERATION AND USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IN THE EXERCISE OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER AND HOW THE DEPICTION OF AI IN SCIENCE FICTION MAY PLAY A ROLE IN DETERMINING FUTURE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THROUGH ITS ROLE IN LIMITING THE EXERCISE OF ARBITRARY POWER, THE RULE OF LAW PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN SOCIETY. WHERE POPULAR RULE OF LAW CONCEPTIONS WERE FREQUENTLY SHAPED BY THEIR AUTHORS' FEARS, THE RULE OF LAW IS A PRODUCT OF FEAR. THE OPERATION OF AI IN SOCIETY IS ALSO TAINTED BY FEAR. THIS FEAR IS EXACERBATED BY SCIENCE FICTION ACCOUNTS THAT FREQUENTLY PORTRAY AI AS COMPLICIT IN A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE. THIS PORTRAYAL OF AI'S ROLE IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING A STATE OF FEAR IN SOCIETY THAT ASSISTS IN PRIMING SOCIETY TO ACCEPT A DIFFERENT FORM OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FUTURE. IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE CONTEMPORARY IDEAS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE SHAPED BY FEAR, AND WHERE FEAR EXISTS IN RELATION TO AI'S EXERCISE OF CONSTITUTIONAL POWER (AND WHERE THIS IS INFLUENCED BY DEPICTIONS OF AI IN SCIENCE FICTION), FEARS ASSOCIATED WITH AI'S EXERCISE OF POWER MAY SHAPE FUTURE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
158	DURING THE LAST DECADE, IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMMISSION IS FAILING TO HALT RULE OF LAW DECLINE IN POLAND AND HUNGARY. HOWEVER, HAS THE COMMISSION LEARNT FROM ITS EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING RULE OF LAW DECLINE IN THESE COUNTRIES? THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT NOT ONLY HAS THE EU COMMISSION FAILED TO LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF SWIFT ACTION IN THE FACE OF BURGEONING RULE OF LAW CRISES BUT HAS ACTIVELY IGNORED SIMILAR SYSTEMIC ISSUES ALTOGETHER IN LITHUANIA, A COUNTRY THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN AN EXEMPLARY MEMBER STATE. THIS ARTICLE WILL ANALYSE THE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN LITHUANIA IN LIGHT OF THE EU COMMISSION'S FIRST TWO RULE OF LAW REPORTS PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER 2020 AND JULY 2021. THESE REPORTS WERE DESIGNED TO ACT AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW IN EACH MEMBER STATE THROUGH DOCUMENTING AND RAISING AWARENESS FOR RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UNION. LITHUANIA HAS LARGELY SLIPPED UNDER THE RADAR OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY SCHOLARS; HOWEVER, IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, LITHUANIA HAS ENDURED A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND SUFFERED AN ATTEMPTED SIEGE OF ITS NATIONAL BROADCASTER. THERE HAS BEEN AN INTENSE DEADLOCK RECENTLY OVER THE ELECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUSTICES, WHICH HAS RAISED CONCERNS OVER THE EXECUTIVE'S PERSISTENT ATTEMPTS TO POLITICISE LITHUANIA'S HIGHEST COURT. WORRYINGLY THE RECENT RULE OF LAW REPORTS, PUBLISHED BY THE EU COMMISSION, FAIL TO REFLECT THE SEVERITY OF THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. THE REPORTS' SILENCE ON THESE ISSUES LEADS THIS ARTICLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE EU COMMISSION IS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO LITHUANIA'S PRECARIOUS RULE OF LAW SITUATION BY FAILING TO TRUTHFULLY DOCUMENT SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THE RULE OF LAW. BY DOING SO, THE COMMISSION NOT ONLY EXACERBATES RULE OF LAW ISSUES DOMESTICALLY BUT ALSO UNDERMINES THE FIGHT AGAINST RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN THE UNION.
159	THE ROLE OF COURTS AS LAWMAKERS HAS BEEN SCRUTINISED, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS IT RAISES REGARDING LEGITIMACY. THIS SCRUTINY HAS SOMETIMES ASSUMED THAT COURTS ARE SAFE FROM LEGITIMACY-BASED CRITICISM IN THEIR ROLE AS APPLIERS OF LAW. HOWEVER, RECENT EVENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SHOW THAT, REGRETTABLY, THIS IS NOT SO: THE MEDIA REACTION TO THE JUDGMENTS IN THE BREXIT CASE OF MILLER WENT FAR BEYOND CRITICISM OF THE COURTS' REASONING OR CONCLUSIONS. IT WAS AN ATTACK ON LEGITIMACY. INSOFAR AS SUCH ATTACKS ARISE OUT OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE NATURE OF ADJUDICATION (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXISTENCE AND SCOPE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION), ONE WAY OF COUNTERING THEM IS FOR THE LEGAL COMMUNITY (SCHOLARS, JUDGES, PRACTITIONERS) TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THESE ISSUES. HOWEVER, IT IS INCUMBENT UPON OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE - THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATURE - TO RESPOND PROMPTLY TO SUCH ATTACKS IN ORDER TO UPHOLD THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
160	THAILAND HAS SEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN THE RULE OF LAW SINCE THE SEMINAL 1997 CONSTITUTION. YET PERSISTENT POLITICAL INSTABILITY SUGGESTS THAT AS YET THE COUNTRY DOES NOT THINK OF THE RULE OF LAW AS BINDING. WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN THAILAND WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND WITH GOVERNANCE GENERALLY? THE ARGUMENT ADVANCED HERE IS THAT RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES MUST CONTEND WITH THE REALISATION THAT THE TRADITIONAL THAI TRINITY - NATION, RELIGION AND KING - HAS BECOME AN INVIOLABLE STATE IDEOLOGY. POLITICAL ACTORS, OFTEN ALIGNED WITH THE MONARCHY, HAVE BEEN USING EACH ELEMENT OF THE TRINITY TO UNDERMINE BOTH RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. NOW THAT LONG-SERVING MONARCH KING BHUMIBOL (RAMA IX) HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON KING VARIJALONGKORN, IT SEEMS AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO EXAMINE CURRENT BATTLES ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND BROADER STRUGGLES FOR CONTROL BETWEEN ELITES AND POPULAR GROUPS BASED ON COMPETING VISIONS FOR THE STATE - A PROBLEM NOT ONLY IN THAILAND BUT IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE.
161	THINKING SKILLS ARE A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LEGAL SOCIETY AND DEMOCRACY. THUS, THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION, THE AIM OF WHICH WAS TO SHOW THE PERCEPTION OF PEOPLE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THINKING SKILLS. RESEARCH TASKS WERE TO CONSIDER THINKING SKILLS USING L. STARKEY'S ADAPTED THINKING SKILLS TEST AND DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THINKING SKILLS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY IS IN CORRELATION BETWEEN THINKING SKILLS AND PERCEPTION TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE: (1) DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF THINKING SKILLS OF STUDENTS USING AN ADAPTED VERBAL TEST BY L. STARKEY; (2) DETERMINING THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THINKING SKILLS AND THE RULE OF LAW. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN THE FORM OF A STUDY OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND STUDENTS' CRITICAL THINKING WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST AT A SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF P <= 0.05. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A QUESTIONNAIRE ON THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. 25 STUDENTS FROM SOUTH CHINA NORMAL UNIVERSITY TOOK PART IN THE STUDY WHEN THEY WERE IN THEIR 1ST STUDY YEAR (2017, 1ST STUDY STAGE) AND 4TH STUDY YEAR (THE SAME STUDENTS, 2021, 2ND STUDY STAGE). THE STUDY FOUND THAT STUDENTS' THINKING SKILLS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEY ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW INCREASED (BY 43.50% AND 66.32%, RESPECTIVELY). AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT STUDENTS' THINKING SKILLS AND SELF-ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHETHER THEY ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW HAVE A STRONG CORRELATION (0.714 AT STAGE 1 OF THE STUDY AND 0.724 AT STAGE 2). THE DATA OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THE NEED TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IN THE CURRICULUM TASKS AND COURSES THAT WILL INCREASE STUDENTS' CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS. SUCH AN APPROACH WILL ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PROSPECT FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES OF INCLUDING THINKING SKILLS IN EDUCATIONAL CURRICULA AND IMPROVING PERCEPTION TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE STUDENTS OF THE DEPARTMENTS ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS.
162	THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) RECENTLY CONVENED FOR THE FIRST TIME A CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENARY SESSION ADDRESSED THE TOPIC OF RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHY THE PARTY FELT THE NEED TO HOLD A PLENUM ON RULE OF LAW NOW, AND ANALYSES THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE DECISION ISSUED AT THE PLENUM. THE DECISION SOUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH THREE MAIN TASKS. FIRST, TO RECONFIRM FOR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES THAT CHINA IS PURSUING ITS OWN PATH OF DEVELOPMENT AIMED AT ESTABLISHING SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS; SECOND, TO PROVIDE A CENTRAL-LEVEL COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR REFORMS THAT CUTS ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND RISES ABOVE DEPARTMENTAL INTERESTS; AND THIRD, TO MOVE BEYOND THE HARDWARE OF LEGAL REFORMS TO THE SOFTWARE BY PROMOTING THE NORMS AND PRACTICES OF A RULE OF LAW CULTURE FOR OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS ALIKE. I CONCLUDE WITH AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE REFRAIN AGENDA SET OUT IN THE DECISION AND A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHINA'S EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW FOR THE PROMOTION OF RULE OF LAW GLOBALLY.
163	THE ECONOMIC LITERATURE IS CLEAR THAT TRANSPARENT AND IMPARTIAL RULE OF LAW IS CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, HOW DOES ONE GUARANTEE RULE OF LAW? THIS PAPER USES THE IDEA OF 'SELF-REINFORCING' INSTITUTIONS TO SHOW HOW POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS MAY DERAIL RULE OF LAW IF ASSOCIATED JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SELF-REINFORCING. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS USING THE CONTRASTING EXAMPLES OF ESTONIA AND POLAND TO FRAME THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN DETERMINING BOTH RULE OF LAW AND THE PATH OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH STARTING TABULA RASA FOR A LEGAL SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT, IT WORKED WELL FOR RULE OF LAW IN ESTONIA IN THE POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITION. ALTERNATELY, POLAND PURSUED A MUCH MORE GRADUALIST STRATEGY OF REFORM OF FORMAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS; THIS APPROACH MEANT THAT JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS, SLOW TO SHED THEIR LEGACY AND CONNECTION WITH THE PAST, WERE RELATIVELY WEAK AND SUSCEPTIBLE TO ATTACK FROM MORE POWERFUL (POLITICAL) ONES. WE CONCLUDE THAT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS CAN PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE IN LINE WITH POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, USING THEIR SELF-REINFORCING NATURE AS A SHIELD FROM POLITICAL WHIMS OF THE DAY.
164	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE ISSUE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE PARADIGM OF CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW ON PUBLIC SERVICES, EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH CHANGES IN THE FIELD OF THE RIGHTS OF THE USERS AND IN THE SPHERE OF REGULATORY AGENCIES.
165	IN CHALLENGING TIMES FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS A CONNECTING THREAD OF THE GLOBAL LEGAL ORDER IS A PARTICULARLY SALIENT TOPIC. BY PROVIDING A WORKING UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTENT AND CONTEXTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, AND BY TAKING THE REGIME OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW AS A CASE STUDY, I ARGUE THAT ASSESSING 'RISE' OR 'DECLINE' MOTIONS IN THIS SPHERE WARRANTS A NUANCED APPROACH THAT SHOULD RECOGNIZE PARALLEL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS. WHILST PROMINENT PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW STRONGLY ALIGN WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS, NUMEROUS CHALLENGES THREATEN THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THE REGIME AND THE APPEAL OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW MORE BROADLY. AT THE SAME TIME, OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO ADAPT THE SUBSTANTIVE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES IN INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES SO TO PURSUE PARALLEL GOALS OF ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW AT BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS. THROUGH RECOGNIZING THE SPECIFICITIES OF INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL SPHERES, ARBITRATORS CAN REINVIGORATE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW THROUGH INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW-BENEFITTING THUS THE FUTURE OF BOTH.
166	FAR FROM BEING AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT, INTERNATIONAL, EUROPEAN, AND SPANISH LEGAL ORDERS CLEARLY CONCEPTUALIZE "RULE OF LAW". CATALAN SECESSIONISM, APPEALING TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, CHALLENGED THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF RULE OF LAW IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN 2012 AND 2017. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A DETAILED EXPLANATION ON HOW SECESSIONISM FUNDAMENTALLY DISREGARDED THE COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE AND, MORE PRECISELY, TWO OF ITS ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS: THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND RESPECT FOR COURTS. IN RELATION TO THE FORMER, CATALAN SEPARATISM ASSUMED COMPETENCES ATTRIBUTED TO THE CENTRAL STATE, IGNORED PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES IN PASSING LEGISLATION ON THE REFERENDUM, AND ADOPTED AD HOC LEGAL SUPREMACY. IN RELATION TO THE SECOND, CATALAN AUTHORITIES REPEATEDLY IGNORED AND DISOBEYED THE SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S RULINGS. HOWEVER, DISRESPECT FOR CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE TURNED INTO AN APPEAL TO IT WHEN CATALAN SECESSIONIST LEADERS SOUGHT TO DEFEND THEIR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN FACE OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
167	THERE IS A GROWING GAP BETWEEN WHAT IS MEANT BY THE RULE OF LAW IN POLITICAL DISCOURSE, ITS IMPLEMENTATION BY PRACTITIONERS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONCEPT IN ACADEMIC ANALYSIS. POLITICALLY, IT IS OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY WITH DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE, WHICH FORM PART OF A REFORM "PACKAGE." PRACTITIONERS TEND TO REDUCE IT TO JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAMS, WHICH HAVE NOT HAD A HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS IN STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW WHEN MEASURED AGAINST A BROADER "ACADEMIC" NOTION OF THE CONCEPT. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO INTRODUCE SOME CLARITY TO THE PLURALITY OF MEANINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW, LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN APPLIED IN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION, AND MAP OUT A NEW APPROACH TO PROMOTE IT IN POSTCONFLICT STATES.
168	COURTS MAY REASON USING PRECEDENTS IN VARIOUS WAYS, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM SATISFY THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES TWO WAYS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS IDEAL AND ONE WHICH IS NOT. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE PRACTICE OF FOLLOWING PRECEDENT IN LAW AND TO OFFER CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING ITS VALUE. TWO CLAIMS ARE DEFENDED. FIRST, COURTS ALWAYS HAVE A REASON TO DECIDE PRECEDENT-GOVERNED DISPUTES BY FOLLOWING PRECEDENT. THIS REASON IS A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND IN SOME CASES THIS REASON MAY BE REINFORCED IN THE FORM OF AN OBLIGATION. SECONDLY, DEPENDING ON WHETHER COURTS HAVE A REASON OR AN OBLIGATION TO FOLLOW PRECEDENT, TWO MODES OF PRECEDENTIAL REASONING MAY BE IDENTIFIED. THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THEM IN DETAIL. THE MODES, TOGETHER WITH THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE REASONS IN FAVOUR OF THEM OR AGAINST THEM, PROVIDE A VALUABLE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION OF PRECEDENT-FOLLOWING IN LAW.
169	THE PREVALENT APPROACH TO THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AMONG LEGAL THEORISTS PUTS ATTRIBUTES FIRST, ASSIGNING CERTAIN FEATURES OF LAWS AND SOMETIMES LEGAL SYSTEMS AS RULE-OF-LAW VIRTUES. INQUIRING AT A MORE BASIC LEVEL, THIS PAPER ADVANCES A NOVEL, STRUCTURALIST VIEW OF THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE HONORING THEORETICAL CONSTRAINTS THAT GUARD AGAINST DILUTING THE RULE-OF-LAW CONCEPT TOO THINLY AS A REMEDY FOR MYRIAD SOCIETAL ILLS, THIS APPROACH SHOWS THAT THE CONCEPT IMPLICATES INEQUALITIES SUSTAINED BY A SOCIETY'S SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY DEMONSTRATING THAT THE RULE-OF-LAW PROJECT HOLDS A STRUCTURAL POSITION IN THE COLLECTIVE NORMATIVE DISCOURSE AS A VEHICLE BY WHICH PEOPLE MORALLY EVALUATE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL CAPABILITIES OF INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS TO PARTICIPATE IN LAW, AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S TREATMENT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. LAW'S PROCEDURAL OUTPUTS MAY FORMALLY PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH ACCESS TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT THE RULE-OF-LAW PROJECT GOES TO THE ACTUAL CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM IN REALITY, TO HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INPUTS INTO THE SYSTEM, AND TO HAVE THAT PARTICIPATION IMPARTIALLY ADJUDICATED. CONDITIONS IMPACTING A DIVERSITY OF STAKEHOLDERS - AND PARTICULARLY THE MOST DISADVANTAGED WITHIN THE POPULATION - PERTURB THE VIRTUES TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE-OFLAW IDEAL WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS, AND THE POWER EXERCISED TO MAINTAIN THEM, IMPAIR CAPABILITIES FOR FAIR, DIGNIFIED, AND EQUAL ACCESS TO LEGAL PROCESSES. UNDERSTANDING THE RULE OF LAW IN STRUCTURALIST TERMS, AS AN INFORMAL MORAL OPERATOR, (1) MAKES SENSE OF THE SCHISM WE NORMALLY ACCEPT BETWEEN THE CONCEPTS OF LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW, (2) REORIENTS THE SOURCE OF RULE-OF-LAW THINKING FROM THEORISTS BENT ON FIXING A CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION TO COMMUNITIES ENGAGED IN FIRST-ORDER INTERACTIONS WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM, (3) HELPS EXPLAIN WHY CITIZENS COME NOT ONLY TO EXPECT LAW TO CONSTRAIN OFFICIAL COERCIVE POWERS BUT ALSO TO DEMAND THAT LAW PROMOTE THEIR ACTUAL CAPABILITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM ON AN EGALITARIAN AND DIGNITARIAN FOOTING, AND HENCE (4) IMPLICATES A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS OF POLITICAL AND MATERIAL INEQUALITIES THAT CANNOT BUT IMPAIR THE HEALTHY FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE-OF-LAW PROJECT.
170	THE RULE OF LAW AND EDUCATIONAL CHOICES: EVIDENCE FROM ITALIAN REGIONS. REGIONAL STUDIES. EDUCATIONAL CHOICES ABOUT POST-SECONDARY FIELDS OF STUDY VARY ACROSS SPACE AND TIME DUE TO PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOTIVATIONS. A STRAND OF THE LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS VEIN, THIS PAPER EMPHASIZES THE LINK BETWEEN REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND STUDENTS' PREFERENCES BY POINTING OUT HOW EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW DECREASES RESOURCES THAT RENT-SEEKERS MAY EXPROPRIATE, THUS REDUCING INCENTIVES TO CHOOSE CAREERS DEVOTED TO PROTECT PRODUCERS FROM RENT-SEEKING. THE ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION ON ITALIAN REGIONS SUPPORTS THIS VIEW, FINDING THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND RULE OF LAW IN STUDENTS' REGION OF ORIGIN ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR CHOICE.
171	IN LITERATURE, THERE IS A LONG AND ONGOING DISPUTE OVER WHETHER FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE CIVIC VIRTUES. ON THE ONE HAND, THE SO-CALLED DOUX COMMERCE THESIS STATES THAT FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS HAVE A FAVORABLE INFLUENCE ON CIVIC VIRTUES, SUCH AS HONESTY, RESPECT FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND FAIR DEALINGS. THIS IDEA GOES BACK TO, AMONGST OTHERS, ADAM SMITH WHO FAMOUSLY ARGUED THAT WHERE COMMERCE IS INTRODUCED, PEOPLE ARE MORE FAITHFUL TO THEIR WORD. SMITH ALSO BELIEVED THAT CIVIC VIRTUES FOSTER HUMAN HAPPINESS. THE POLICY IMPLICATION WOULD BE THAT FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS INCREASE HAPPINESS BY STIMULATING CIVIC VIRTUES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SO-CALLED SELF-DESTRUCTION THESIS STATES THAT FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS ARE INIMICAL TO THE CIVIC VIRTUES, WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT FREE MARKETS DECREASE HUMAN HAPPINESS BY CROWDING OUT CIVIC VIRTUES. ALTHOUGH THE DEBATE ON FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS AND CIVIC VIRTUES IS VERY RELEVANT TO POLICY MAKERS, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THESE OPPOSING PROPOSITIONS IS STILL SCARCE. IN THIS PAPER WE TEST BOTH RELATIONSHIPS ON A SAMPLE OF 212,431 INDIVIDUALS FROM 80 COUNTRIES BY USING DATA FROM THE WORLD VALUES SURVEY AND THE EUROPEAN VALUES SURVEY OVER THE 1990-2020 PERIOD. WE FOCUS ON ONE IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF FREE MARKET INSTITUTIONS: RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THAT CIVIC VIRTUES ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO RULE OF LAW AND THAT HAPPINESS INCREASES WITH CIVIC VIRTUES. IN ADDITION, CIVIC VIRTUES INDIRECTLY INCREASE HAPPINESS BY STIMULATING TRUST. IN ADDITION, TRUST IS DIRECTLY POSITIVELY RELATED TO RULE OF LAW, INDICATING THAT BOTH FORMAL INSTITUTIONS (RULE OF LAW) AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS (CIVIC VIRTUES) AFFECT TRUST. AN ANALYSIS OF ALL THE EFFECTS OF RULE OF LAW ON HAPPINESS SHOWS, HOWEVER, THAT THE INDIRECT EFFECTS THROUGH CIVIC VIRTUES AND TRUST ARE OF RELATIVELY MINOR IMPORTANCE IN COMPARISON TO ITS TOTAL EFFECT.
172	THIS COMMENTARY ON JEREMY WALDRON'S ESSAY, 'THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ROLE OF COURTS', APPLIES A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDGING SITUATED WITHIN A BROADER COMPLEX OF SURROUNDING SOCIAL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS.
173	RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR A FAIR AND JUST SOCIETY AND APPLY TO GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN BY A HUMAN OR AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW DATA PROTECTION IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (DPIAS) COULD PROVIDE A MECHANISM FOR IMPROVED RULE OF LAW GOVERNANCE OF DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS DEVELOPED AND USED BY GOVERNMENT FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES IN CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS. APPLYING RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES TO TWO CASE STUDIES PROVIDES A SKETCH OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT THIS ARTICLE'S PROPOSALS FOR DPIAS SEEK TO ADDRESS. THE ARTICLE UNDERTAKES COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO FIND RELEVANT PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS FOR GOVERNANCE OF DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS, LOOKING AT HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENTS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND PROCESS RIGHTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. DRAWING ON THIS COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DPIAS, THE ARTICLE OFFERS GUIDANCE ON BOW DPIAS COULD BE USED TO STRENGTHEN THE GOVERNANCE OF DATA PROCESSING BY GOVERNMENT IN RULE OF LAW TERMS.
174	DUE TO THE PARTICULAR POLITICAL REALITY UNDER THE PARTY-STATE, NEITHER A SUBSTANTIAL NOR A FORMAL WAY IS SUFFICIENT TO GRASP THE KEY PROBLEM CONFRONTING THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW, NAMELY THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTY AND THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PRECONDITION FOR RULE OF LAW IN THE CHINESE PARTY-STATE LIES IN THE PARADOX THESIS: HOW AND TO WHICH EXTENT THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTY AND THE STATE WITHIN A PARTY-STATE IS POSSIBLE AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, IN WHICH SENSE SUCH A SEPARATION IS ACHIEVED. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT, WHEN UNDER THE POLITICAL REALITY OF PARTY-STATE, THE KIND OF PARTY-STATE SEPARATION IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL SENSE IS NOT REALIZABLE IN A FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE PARTY-STATE SEPARATION IN THE FUNCTIONAL SENSE AS THE BASIC SPACE SHOULD BE UPHELD AND MAINTAINED, IF MAN CAN STILL ARGUE THAT SOME KIND OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA EXISTS OR IS STILL NEEDED. THIS ARTICLE PLACES THE GENERAL HISTORY OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA UNDER THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTY AND THE STATE AND POINTS OUT THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONFIRMATION OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE REPRESENTS THE CLIMAX OF THE SEPARATION OF THE PARTY AND THE STATE AND THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW ITSELF. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT ANALYSES THE CHALLENGES BROUGHT TO THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW STATE BY THE CONCEPTION OF SO-CALLED "RULE OF LAW CHINA", THE "INTRA-PARTY RULE OF LAW" AND THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE NORMATIVE SUPERIORITY THE PARTY CONSTITUTION OVER THE STATE CONSTITUTION IN RECENT YEARS.
175	UPON ACCESSION TO THE WTO, CHINA COMMITTED TO A SERIES OF SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS "WTO+," AIMED AT THE PROGRESSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CHINESE LEGAL LANDSCAPE. WHILE ONE CANNOT IGNORE A NUMBER OF VERY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS A TRUE POLITICAL RESPONSIVENESS TO OTHER WTO MEMBERS' CONCERNS, CHINA HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO GRASP THE WTO OPPORTUNITY FOR DOMESTIC LEGAL REFORMS AS MUCH AS OBSERVERS, AND SOME CHINESE LEADERS, HAD HOPED FOR. THIS INCOMPLETE NORMATIVE REVOLUTION NOW CREATES TENSIONS BETWEEN WTO MEMBERS, AS EVIDENCED BY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF DISPUTES SHEDDING A DIRECT LIGHT ON THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM. TEN YEARS LATER, THIS PIECE REFLECTS UPON PREDICTIONS ABOUT CHINESE "RULE OF LAW BY INTERNATIONALISATION," WHILE PUTTING CHINA'S LEGAL REFORM INTO A BROADER POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE.
176	THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO CLARIFY AND FACE SOME OF THE THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF SOCIAL RULE OF LAW AND NEO-CONSTITUTIONALISM IN ORDER TO AVOID INCURRING THE USUAL EQUIVOCAL STATEMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DOGMATICS. TO THAT EFFECT, WE FIRST DESCRIBE THE OVERRIDING ELEMENTS OF THE MODERN STATE CONCEPT AND HOW GLOBALIZATION HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON IT. NEXT, WE EXPLAIN THE STANDARD THEORY REGARDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. THE THIRD PART OF THE PAPER PRESENTS THE VARIOUS MODELS OF CITIZENSHIP, THAT IS, MODELS RELATED TO THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. TO CONCLUDE, WE PRESENT THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONALISM WITH REGARD TO CONSTITUTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THERE WE SUGGEST THAT THE NORMATIVE STATEMENTS INVERTED LEFT PERPENDICULAR-THE WAY THEY APPEAR IN CONSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES- ARE NOT ENOUGH TO REGULATE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS WHICH MAKES IT A REQUIREMENT TO MAKE A LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RIGHTS IN THE SPECIFIC CASES IN ORDER TO ADAPT LAW TO SOCIAL REALITY.
177	HUMAN HEALTH IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN THAT GRADUALLY EXISTS IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THE KEY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ON HAPPINESS AND HEALTH USING A TIME SERIES DATA OF CHINA OVER THE DATA PERIOD 1998-2020. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS UTILIZES THE AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG (ARDL) METHOD TO FIND OUT THE SHORT AND LONG-RUN EFFECTS. FINDINGS REVEAL THAT THE RULE OF LAW STIMULATES HAPPINESS AND HUMAN HEALTH IN THE LONG-RUN. MORE INTERNET AND GDP ENHANCE HAPPINESS AND HUMAN HEALTH IN THE LONG-RUN. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT HEALTH EXPENDITURE AND EDUCATION COULD NOT BOOST HAPPINESS AND HEALTH IN THE LONG RUN, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT'S NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HEALTH. POLICYMAKERS MAY USE OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS TO DETERMINE APPLICABLE POLICIES TO INCREASE HUMAN HEALTH ACROSS CHINA PROVINCES.
178	THIS PAPER DEALS WITH THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ITALIAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND TRIES TO IDENTIFY TWO POSSIBLE RECENT LEGISLATIVE INTERPRETATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THERE WILL BE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, FOLLOWED BY A SUMMARY ABOUT THE BINDING ROLE OF PRECEDENTS AND THE SOFT LAW, AS INTRODUCED IN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS. THESE CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS TWO ATTEMPTS TO EMBODY THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ITALIAN LEGAL ENVIRONMENT.
179	THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO PROBLEMATIZE THE TENSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARGUMENT TO BE DEFENDED REQUIRES THE NECESSARY CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESENCE OF CONFLICT AS A CENTRAL ELEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC REGIMES, DESPITE THE ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL IT BY THE LIBERAL TRADITION STILL TODAY HEGEMONIC IN POLITICAL THOUGHT. ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN STATE, LAW, CAPITALISM AND DEMOCRACY, AS WELL AS POINTING OUT THE OUTSTANDING SUBJECT OF THE CONFLICTS THAT FLOURISH IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY IS THE PRETENSION OF THIS ACADEMIC TEXT.
180	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS FOUNDED ON A SET OF COMMON PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AS ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHEREAS FUTURE MEMBER STATES ARE VETTED FOR THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE VALUES BEFORE THEY ACCEDE TO THE UNION, NO SIMILAR METHOD EXISTS TO SUPERVISE RESPECT OF THESE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES AFTER ACCESSION. THIS GAP NEEDS TO BE FILLED, SINCE HISTORY PROVED THAT EU MEMBER STATE GOVERNMENTS' ADHERENCE TO FOUNDATIONAL EU VALUES CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE NEED AND POSSIBILITIES FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EU SCOREBOARD ON EU VALUES; VIABLE STRATEGIES AND PROCEDURES TO REGULARLY MONITOR ALL MEMBER STATES' COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW ON AN EQUAL AND OBJECTIVE BASIS; AND THE NATURE OF EFFECTIVE AND DISSUASIVE SANCTION MECHANISMS FORESEEN FOR RULE OF LAW VIOLATORS.
181	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU. HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE RESPECTED NOT ONLY BY THE EU INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO IN THE MEMBER STATES. THIS EXPLAINS THAT THE LUXEMBOURG COURT HAS DECIDED ABOUT HOW THE INFRINGEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE MEMBER STATES AFFECT THE EU LEGAL ORDER. HOWEVER, THE FORMER IMPLIES THAT THE EU COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE NATIONAL COURTS, ALL OF THEM, HAVE COMPETENCE IN DISPUTES RELATING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES. WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF MUTUAL TRUST, THIS SITUATION COULD CAUSE CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATIONAL AND EU AUTHORITIES. THE DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE LAW ISSUED BY THE EU IS ALSO CONSIDERED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE HYBRID NATURE OF THE EU, IN WHICH WE CAN FIND INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION MECHANISMS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONS THAT DIRECTLY REPRESENT EUROPEAN CITIZENS.
182	WE INVESTIGATE THE LINK BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND EQUITY RETURNS IN POST-TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES OVER THE PERIOD JANUARY 2010-DECEMBER 2020 BY USING PANEL DATA REGRESSIONS. BY APPLYING SEVERAL RULE-OF-LAW PROXIES FOR NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORKS AND JUSTICE SYSTEM QUALITY AS PROXIES FOR THE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE, THE DATA SETS FROM THE CAPITAL MARKETS OF POLAND, LATVIA, LITHUANIA, AND ESTONIA SHOWED THAT COUNTRY-LEVEL JUDICIAL SYSTEM QUALITY IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF COMPANY MARKET PERFORMANCE, AND THAT POST-TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES WITH LOWER RULE-OF-LAW MEASURES EXHIBIT HIGHER RETURNS ON EQUITY THAN THOSE WITH BETTER MEASURES. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SINCE POOR GOVERNANCE AND COUNTRY INSTABILITY INCREASE AGENCY AND TRANSACTION COSTS, IN ADDITION TO DECREASING GROWTH PROSPECTS AND PROFITABLE PROJECTS AVAILABLE TO COMPANIES, THE RISK PREMIUM DEMANDED BY INVESTORS INCREASES, LEADING TO HIGHER EQUITY RETURNS.
183	IN RECENT YEARS, DIVERSE THREATS ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES TO THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. FOCUS HAS MAINLY CENTRED ON THE ARTICLE 7 TEU PROCEDURE. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT EU OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING REGARD TO ITS INTERNAL PREMISES AND CREDIBILITY; THE QUESTION CAN BE POSED WHETHER EU CENSORSHIP IS AFFECTED BY A EVER-ENCROACHING WEAKNESS THAT CURRENTLY CHARACTERISES THE PRESENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN STATES AND REGIONAL OR SUPRANATIONAL ORDERS, WHOSE AUTHORITY IS MET AT TIMES WITH RESISTANCE. ZOOMING OUT FROM THE DAILY THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN SO-CALLED ILLIBERAL OR POPULIST GOVERNMENTS, THIS PAPER SCRUTINISES SOME USUAL THEORETICAL TOOLS AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS, NAMELY THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ARBITRARINESS AND THE RULE OF LAW ON ONE HAND, AND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE OVERALL IDEA OF PUBLIC LAW ON THE OTHER. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE PRESENT CRISIS IS PART OF A SEISMIC SHIFT OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE IDEA OF PUBLIC LAW THAT UNDERPIN THE MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY STATE. AFTER EXAMINING FURTHER CASE LAW AND EVIDENCE OF ARBITRARINESS AND NON-ARBITRARINESS THAT EXCEEDS THE FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS PAPER CHALLENGES THE CONVICTION THAT A GENERIC NOTION OF ARBITRARINESS CAN CAPTURE THE PROBLEM OF ILLIBERAL GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS, OR JUSTIFY THE EUROPEAN UNION ATTITUDE IN RESPONDING TO A 'RULE OF LAW CRISIS'.
184	THIS ESSAY MAKES A THEORETICAL ARGUMENT FOR REIMAGINING 'THE RULE OF LAW' IN LIGHT OF 'LEGAL PLURALISM'. BUILDING ON THE WORK OF DESMOND MANDERSON AND RODERICK MACDONALD IN PARTICULAR, THE ESSAY CONSIDERS WHAT IT MEANS FOR LAW'S PLURALISM-THE DIFFERENCES THAT ANIMATE THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF LAW-TO BE THE VERY PULSE OF ITS RULE. IN DOING SO, THE ESSAY SEEKS TO OPEN THE FRAME THAT HAS BEEN PLACED AROUND THE RULE OF LAW IN TWO WAYS. ON ONE SIDE: TO SEE BEYOND THE LAW THAT IS MADE INTELLIGIBLE THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIZED MODES OF EXPRESSION TO THE LAW THAT IS MADE SENSIBLE THROUGH THE RICHLY EXPRESSIVE MEDIA OF HUMAN CULTURE (THUS OPENING THE FRAME AROUND THE 'LAW' THAT IS SEEN TO RULE). AND ON THE OTHER SIDE: TO SEE BEYOND LAW AS A MODE OF GOVERNANCE TO LAW IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF SUBJECTS (THUS OPENING THE FRAME AROUND HOW THIS LAW IS SEEN TO 'RULE'). THE RESULT IS A REIMAGINATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A BROADLY SOCIO-CULTURAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN A NARROWLY LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT. THE ESSAY PROCEEDS IN TWO STEPS, BEGINNING WITH LAW'S PLURALISM BEFORE TURNING TO LAW'S RULE.
185	THE PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE SHADOW ECONOMY IN 18 SELECTED TRANSITION ECONOMIES. THIS STUDY USES ANNUAL DATA OVER THE PERIOD 2002-2015 FOR 18 TRANSITION COUNTRIES TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF RULE OF LAW AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY. THE TRANSITION COUNTRY GROUP IS CLASSIFIED BASED ON INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND RESOURCES AND IS SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA. THE DATA EXAMINED IN THIS RESEARCH ARE DERIVED FROM THE WORLD BANK, WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS PROJECT AND WORKING PAPER FROM INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. THIS STUDY EMPLOYS GMM METHOD. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH INDICATORS HAVE NEGATIVE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE SHADOW ECONOMY. ADDITIONALLY, THESE RESULTS ALSO REVEAL THAT IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES THE SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS OF THIS RESEARCH ALSO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INFLATION, PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND THE SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY. HENCE THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT THE SIZE OF SHADOW ECONOMY COULD BE CONTROLLED BY IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE OF LAW AND THE GROWTH OF ECONOMY PARTICULARLY IN TRANSITION COUNTRIES.
186	AT THE HEART OF MODERN SOCIETY AND STATES IS THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. IN THE CONTEXT OF STOICISM, IT IS CONSIDERED AS A MORAL PRINCIPLE AND ROMAN LEGAL PHILOSOPHY FOR REMOVING ARBITRARINESS FROM POLITICAL JUDGMENTS, PRACTICES, AND PROCESSES. ACCORDINGLY, THIS ARTICLE'S MAIN GOAL IS TO EXAMINE THE PHENOMENON OF MODERN STATES, WHICH BEGAN IN EUROPE BUT HAS SINCE SPREAD TO MANY OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD, IN TERMS OF THE RULE OF LAW AS THIS NOTION IS THE BASIS FOR ALL MODERN STATES (I.E., POSITIVE LAW). A COMPARATIVE STUDY IS CONDUCTED IN THIS REGARD IN ORDER TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST WESTERN LEGAL PRECEDENTS SUCH AS STOICISM, RECHTSSTAAT [RULE OF LAW], ALSO KNOWN AS ETAT DE DROIT IN FRENCH AND STATO DI DIRITTO IN ITALIAN, WITH RESPECT TO ITS PHILOSOPHICAL AND HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME. THE RELEVANT LITERATURE WAS ANALYZED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE BEST METHOD. IN THIS FRAMEWORK, THE STUDY EXPLORES THE NOTIONS OF RECHTSSTAAT AS THE GERMAN, ETAT DE DROIT AS THE FRENCH, AND STATO DI DIRITTO AS THE ITALIAN PHILOSOPHY OF LAW.
187	CHINESE GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE INVOLVES THE TWO DIMENSIONS OF AUTONOMY AND CO-GOVERNANCE. THE PROCESS OF MOVING FROM GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT TO GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE IS A SYNCHRONOUS PROCESS OF MOVING FROM GOVERNMENT BY A LEGAL SYSTEM TO A "RULE OF LAW" GOVERNMENT. SUCH GOVERNANCE COINCIDES WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL GUARANTEES, GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORKS, INTRINSIC VALUES, EXTERNAL FORMS, GOAL PURSUITS AND CONSTRUCTION PATHS AND LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE REALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE. THE MULTI-SUBJECT STRUCTURE, MULTIPLICITY OF RULES AND REGULATIONS, INTERACTION OF PROCESSES, DIVERSITY OF MODES AND COMPLEXITY OF DISPUTES IN THIS FORM OF GOVERNANCE PLACE NEW DEMANDS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEEDS, WE SHOULD IMPROVE THE GOVERNMENT'S FUNCTIONAL ORIENTATION AND THE DISPOSITION OF ITS POWERS BY MEANS OF STATUTE LAW; EXPAND THE TYPES OF ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES AND IMPROVE THE LAWS ON ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS; ENRICH THE SOURCES OF LAW; USE CONSENSUS RULES TO IMPROVE CONTROLLING RULES; BE GUIDED BY INTERACTIVITY IN IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE SYSTEM; NORMALIZE DIVERSIFIED ADMINISTRATIVE BEHAVIOR; AND ESTABLISH MULTIPLE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISMS AND STRENGTHEN RIGHT RELIEF. THIS WILL HIGHLIGHT THE RULE OF LAW PATH TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE. IN THE COURSE OF THE INTEGRATION AND INTERACTION OF SUCH GOVERNANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, WE WILL NEED TO COORDINATE OUR RESPONSES TO ITS LATENT RISKS, SUCH AS GOVERNANCE PITFALLS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
188	THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN 'BLACK LETTER' LAW AND ITS REAL-LIFE IMPLEMENTATION. THE CORRELATION IS TO BE EXAMINED IN LIGHT OF COUNTRIES' AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S PROCLAIMED GOAL, NAMELY TO EMBED AND IMPLEMENT THE 'RULE OF LAW' PRINCIPLE DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL DOCUMENTS, AS WELL AS STATEMENTS BY POLITICAL PERSONALITIES, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME THE DOMINANT VECTOR FOR DEVELOPMENT. IT IS PROCLAIMED TO BE ONE OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL ORDERS IN MANY COUNTRIES AND IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. BUT IS THE RULE OF LAW THE MOST IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC OF LEGAL ORDERS INSIDE OF STATES AND, WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, BETWEEN THEM? IS THERE AN ACTUAL WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF STATES TO STRENGTHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW? THIS ARTICLE OBSERVES THE ORIGINS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA. BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IMPACT EACH OTHER. SOME FORMS OF THIS INTERACTION AND THEIR MUTUAL INFLUENCE ARE CHARACTERIZED BELOW. THE STUDY ALSO TRACES INTENT AS FORMALIZED IN INTERNATIONAL DECLARATIONS AND THEIR DE-FACTO STANCE TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS SCRUTINY ENABLES THE CONCLUSION THAT 'BLACK LETTER LAW' AND REAL-LIFE APPLICATION DO NOT CURRENTLY COINCIDE. THERE ARE CLEAR CONTRADICTORY TRENDS RELATING TO THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE AT BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS. THE FIRST CONTRADICTION LIES IN THE ENTRENCHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLE BY REGULATORY MEANS. THE SECOND CONTRADICTION REVEALS DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN REGULATORY INSTRUMENTS AND REAL ACTIONS AND POLICIES. THE ARTICLE EVALUATES PREDISPOSITIONS FOR THESE OPPOSING TENDENCIES; IT ALSO ASSESSES ALTERNATIVE PROSPECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW.
189	WITH INCREASING VIGOR SINCE THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, POLICE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE HAVE PROLIFERATED THEIR COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGIES, INCLUDING PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL POLICE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION (INTERPOL). THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES SOME OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN LIGHT OF THE PROSPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT TOWARD A GLOBAL RULE OF LAW. BASED ON THE THEORY OF POLICE BUREAUCRATIZATION, IT IS SHOWN THAT POLICE INSTITUTIONS HAVE INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES IRRESPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS. THIS ARTICLE REVEALS THE DYNAMICS OF SUCH INTERNATIONAL POLICE EFFORTS BY EXAMINING THE COUNTERTERRORIST POLICIES OF INTERPOL. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE OUTCOME OF THE RELATIVE SEPARATION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL POLICE PRACTICES, ON ONE HAND, AND GLOBAL LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS, ON THE OTHER, WILL BE CRITICAL IN ASSESSING ANY EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT THE SOCIETAL PROCESSES AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TERRORISM ON A GLOBAL SCALE.
190	A MAJOR ASPECT OF THE UNITED STATES' WAR EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES HAS BEEN THE WAGING OF A COUNTERINSURGENCY CAMPAIGN. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER WESTERN INTERVENING NATIONS DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED RULE OF LAW SUPPORT MISSIONS AS A COMPONENT OF THE OVERARCHING COUNTERINSURGENCY MISSION. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF THE RULE OF LAW MISSIONS, ANALYZING THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM TWO DECADES OF CONFLICT TO PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR THE POLICYMAKERS AND STRATEGIC PLANNERS WHO WILL BE TASKED WITH EXECUTING COUNTERINSURGENCY CAMPAIGNS IN THE FUTURE. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES IN PARTICULAR ON THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND CULTURAL FACTORS OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THAT IMPACTED THE VIABILITY OF THE WESTERN COUNTERINSURGENCY AND RULE OF LAW MISSIONS.
191	RECENT LITERATURE HAS ANALYZED THREE MAIN CHANNELS REGARDING THE EFFECT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE ON LEGAL INSTITUTIONS: OVERALL OPENNESS TO TRADE, A SPECIALIZATION ON INSTITUTIONALLY INTENSIVE EXPORTS, AND A DEPENDENCE ON EXPORTS OF NATURAL RESOURCES. UNLIKE PREVIOUS LITERATURE, WE EXAMINE ALL THESE CHANNELS WITHIN A SINGLE REGRESSION FRAMEWORK. IMPORTANTLY, WE DEVELOP A NEW MEASURE OF INSTITUTIONAL INTENSITY OF EXPORTS AT THE GOODS LEVEL BASED ON NEARLY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DISAGGREGATED BILATERAL TRADE FLOWS. OUR NEW MEASURE SHOWS THAT GOODS SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL FRAGMENTATION OF PRODUCTION ARE THE MOST INSTITUTIONALLY INTENSIVE. USING A SAMPLE OF 144 COUNTRIES, OUR REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT SPECIALIZATION ON INSTITUTIONALLY INTENSIVE EXPORTS, ESPECIALLY ON FRAGMENTED GOODS, HELPS COUNTRIES TO IMPROVE THEIR RULE OF LAW. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT GREATER OPENNESS IMPROVES THE RULE OF LAW, BUT WE FAIL TO FIND ANY EFFECT FROM NATURAL RESOURCES EXPORTS. (C) 2021 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
192	THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW DESIDERATA AND THE PHENOMENON OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS, FIRST IT IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND BY THE TERMS "RULE OF LAW" AND "JUDICIAL DISCRETION". IN THIS SENSE, THE CONCEPTION OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION THAT IS OFFERED IN THIS WORK TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS PARTLY ORIGINATED BY THE INEVITABLE - AND, IN SOME CASES, EVEN DESIRABLE - PARTIAL INDETERMINATION OF LAW. THUS, THE MAIN FEATURE OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS LINKED WITH A CERTAIN MARGIN OF FREEDOM THAT JUDGES HAVE WHEN DECIDING CASES THAT HAVE AT LEAST TWO JUSTIFIED POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THIS WORK PUTS FORWARD A NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW DESIDERATA AND CHARACTERIZES THE LATTER AS IDEALS THAT: (I) AIM AT SERVING VALUABLE PURPOSES, (II) ADMIT DEGREES OF ACCOMPLISHMENT, AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE - AND, IN SOME CASES, EVEN UNDESIRABLE - TO FULFILL THEM EITHER COMPLETELY OR TO THEIR GREATEST POSSIBLE EXTENT. BASED ON THESE NOTIONS, THIS WORK INTENDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IF THE RULE OF LAW DESIDERATA ARE UNDERSTOOD AS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS MEANT TO BE FULLY ACCOMPLISHED, AND THAT EVEN IN SOME CASES SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT TO THEIR GREATEST POSSIBLE EXTENT, THEN THEY CAN BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PHENOMENON OF JUDICIAL DISCRETION.
193	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES THE DISCUSSION OF DEMOCRATIZATION AS A COMPLEX PROCESS. MUCH OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION STORY FOCUSES ON WEALTH AND HOW IT ADVANCES OR MAINTAINS LIBERALIZATION. HOWEVER, IN THIS WORK, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ROUTE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE ROUTE TO WEALTH LIE IN THE LIMITATIONS ON THE STATE, SPECIFICALLY THE RULE OF LAW WHICH HOLDS THE STATE ACCOUNTABLE AS IT CREATES A REALM OF SOVEREIGN SPACE FOR MAN. WE FOCUS ON THE RULE OF LAW AND EVALUATE HOW THE LACK OF CORRUPTION IN GOVERNMENT AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS IMPACT WEALTH, THE FORMATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY, AND THE CORRESPONDING SHIFT OF POWER STRUCTURES THAT LEAD TO DEMOCRATIZATION EFFORTS. WE ANALYZE THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH A NESTED ANALYSIS DESIGN, FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WHERE PREVIOUS MODERNIZATION THEORIES HAVE BEEN LESS APPLICABLE, AND EXPLAIN HOW RULE OF LAW HAS AN INCREASING IMPACT ON BOTH DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRATIZATION.
194	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE 'RULE OF LAW' HAS BECOME A CENTRAL GOAL IN POPULAR STRUGGLES THE WORLD OVER, AND IT IS CITIZENSHIP STRUGGLES WHICH INFUSE THE RULE OF LAW WITH SUBSTANTIVE, AS AGAINST A THIN PROCEDURAL, MEANING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN POST-COLONIAL SOCIETIES LIKE INDIA, WITH A TRADITION OF INHERITED COLONIAL LAW DESIGNED FOR SUBJECT-HOOD RATHER THAN CITIZENSHIP, GROWING INEQUALITY WHICH AFFECTS BOTH THE ENACTMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF LAW, AND THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY THOSE WHO ARE MEANT TO PROTECT IT. DEMANDING IMPLEMENTATION OF EXISTING LAWS, BREAKING LAWS THAT ARE PATENTLY UNJUST WHETHER THROUGH ARMED STRUGGLE OR NON-VIOLENT SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, OR SEEKING TO CHANGE LAWS IN FAVOUR OF NEW AND MORE DEMOCRATIC LAWS, ARE ALL MAJOR AVENUES BY MEANS OF WHICH PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR ASPIRATIONS AS CITIZENS. HOWEVER, LAW'S MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE RELATION WITH SOCIAL PRACTICE MEANS THAT PEOPLE ENTER INTO POLITICAL AND LEGAL NEGOTIATIONS ALREADY CONSTITUTED AS CERTAIN KINDS OF LEGAL SUBJECTS, WHICH CONSTRAINS THEIR IMAGINATION IN CERTAIN WAYS.
195	AFTER CHARACTERIZING THE "CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW" STATES AND THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS IN THE IBERO-AMERICAN SPHERE, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THREE DIFFICULTIES (THE COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN ONE, THE CRITIQUE TO VIEWING RIGHTS AS PRINCIPLES, AND THE PROBLEM OF JUDICIAL ACTIVISM) THAT SHOW THE INABILITY OF PART OF THE INTERNAL LEGAL CULTURE TO ASSUME THE REQUIREMENTS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. CONSEQUENTLY, THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS IT IS URGENT TO BUILD A LEGAL CONSTITUTIONALISM: A THEORY OF LAW ADAPTED TO THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.
196	THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS UNAMBIGUOUSLY ENSHRINED IN THE NIGERIAN CONSTITUTION. THE ONLY SURPRISING THING TO ANY COMPETENT INDIVIDUAL IS THE BLATANT DISRESPECT SHOWN TO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION BY NIGERIAN RULERS WHO HAD OPENLY SWORN TO UPHOLD IT. FROM THE BACKDROP OF SEVERAL CASES OF UNJUSTIFIABLE ARRESTS, UNFAIR TRIALS, EXECUTIVE LAWLESSNESS, SUPPRESSION OF FREE SPEECH AND UNDUE DOMINATION OF MINORITIES, THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO DEFEND THE THESIS THAT NIGERIAN RULERS HAVE BECOME SYBARITIC IN THEIR CONSCIOUS REDUCTION OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW TO A MERE CONSTITUTIONAL MYTH AND NEVER A REALITY THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE.
197	THE INFLUENCE OF A CONSTITUTION MAY SEEM OBVIOUS PARTICULARLY IN AFRICA. SOMETIMES, THERE ARE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES SUPPORTING GOVERNANCE ISSUES SUCH AS AN ELECTORAL PROCESS AND THE PROMOTION OF MAJORITY RULE; GIVING A VOICE FOR MINORITIES, INCLUSIVENESS, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION; ASSEMBLY; THE FREE PRESS AND POLITICAL CULTURE. THIS STUDY EMPLOYS A CONTENT ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE CONCEPT OF POLITICS AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN AFRICA AND HOW THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE ENTRENCHED. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE LESSONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTITUTIONALISM RELATING TO GOVERNANCE OF THE POLITICAL LIFE IN WHICH THE CONSTITUTIONAL FORMS ARE LOCATED. IN SOME CASES, REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE ONLY PAID LIP SERVICE. ELITES AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO RESERVE FOR THEMSELVES UNFETTERED DISCRETION ON PUBLIC AFFAIRS. IT APPEARS THAT ELECTORAL SYSTEMS IN SOME AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS OF A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS DUE TO NON-COMPLIANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, LACK OF THE PRACTICE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND BAD POLITICAL CULTURE. KENYA AND ZIMBABWE SERVE AS EXAMPLES WHERE ELECTION RESULTS HAVE BEEN DISPUTED HEAVILY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT POLITICS SHOULD BE INSTRUMENTAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTITUTIONS AND NOT VICE VERSA AND THAT AFRO-PESSIMISM OR AFRO-OPTIMISM SHOULD TRANSLATE TO AFRO-REALISM.
198	AFRICA'S STRUGGLE AGAINST MASS POVERTY AND DEPRIVATION IS EXAMINED USING A CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY APPROACH. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE FAILURE OF MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH POVERTY IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT SINCE INDEPENDENCE, THESE COUNTRIES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE IN DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION MAKING TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW. SUCH INSTITUTIONS MUST ADEQUATELY CONSTRAIN CIVIL SERVANTS AND POLITICAL ELITES, ENHANCE PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AND PROVIDE AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CREATION OF WEALTH. THE PROCESS TO RECONSTRUCT AND RECONSTITUTE AFRICAN STATES HAS BEEN ON GOING SINCE DECOLONIZATION. THE ARAB AWAKENING, WHICH BEGAN IN NORTH AFRICA, AND THE PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE MID-1980S AND EARLY-1990S, ARE A CONTINUATION OF THIS EFFORT TO SECURE THE LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS THAT ENHANCE THE CREATION OF WEALTH AND PROVIDE AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE EVENTUAL ERADICATION OF POVERTY. UNLESS THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW, POVERTY WILL REMAIN PERVASIVE.
199	THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARE WIDELY REGARDED AS NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL SOCIETY, BUT DEFINING THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND EXPLAINING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS PROVEN ELUSIVE. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS WITH EXPLANATIONS POSITED BY HAYEK AND OTHERS, BUT BRINGS A FRESH PERSPECTIVE GROUNDED IN A MULTIDISCIPLINARY AND CONTEXTUAL APPROACH THAT INCLUDES HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, ECONOMICS, AND LAW. PROPERLY DEFINED, THE RULE OF LAW REFERS TO A SPECIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND GOVERNMENT. THE COMMON LAW CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW (AS OPPOSED TO THE CIVILIAN RECHTSSTAAT OR L'ETAT DE DROIT) IS HISTORICALLY MORE SUPPORTIVE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BUT MODERN INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS AND DEFINITIONS CONFUSE THE TWO. BASED ON EMPIRICAL ECONOMIC STUDIES AND HISTORICAL LEGAL ANTHROPOLOGY, THE COMMON LAW UNDERSTANDING FOCUSED ON LIMITED GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM FROM INTERFERENCE HAS PROVEN MORE LIKELY TO ENCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND HENCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON A LONG-TERM BASIS.
200	VIETNAM IS IMPLEMENTING GLOBAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, SO THE LAW MUST ALSO BE RENOVATED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION. BECAUSE THE LAW IS ATTACHED TO THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS, IT SHOWS THE CONSISTENCY IN VIETNAM'S POLITICS, ECONOMY, AND DIPLOMACY. IN THE WORLD, THE RULE OF LAW IS A TYPICAL VALUE THAT HUMANITY AIMS FOR BECAUSE IT UPHOLDS THE LAW, EXPRESSING OUR NATION'S ASPIRATION FOR A DEMOCRATIC AND EQUAL SOCIETY. THEREFORE, VIETNAM HAS BUILT A SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. TO ACHIEVE THIS, VIETNAM MUST ENSURE THE FREE POWER OF ITS CITIZENS, PROMOTE THE DEMOCRACY OF THE STATE, AND ENSURE THAT POWER BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. THE PAPER USES A MATERIALIST DIALECTICAL METHOD TO EXAMINE THE BUILDING OF CIVIC CONSCIOUSNESS THAT PROMOTES THE PERFECTION OF VIETNAM'S CURRENT SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARTICLE ALSO USES ANALYTICAL METHODS AND SYNTHETIC METHODS TO CLARIFY THE SENSE OF CITIZENSHIP IN THE VIETNAMESE STATE, VIETNAM'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW IS CORRECT.

201	THIS PAPER CHALLENGES THE SEEMINGLY UNCOMPROMISABLE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF MAN IN THE DISCUSSION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. WHEREAS THE RULE OF LAW HAS LONG BEEN STRESSED AS AN INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT IN THE SUSTAINED SURVIVAL OF DEMOCRACY, WE POINT OUT THAT, LIKE THE RULE-OF-MAN-BASED INSTITUTION, IT IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL DETERIORATION. WHEN DETERIORATION DOES OCCUR, THE SUSTAINABILITY OF DEMOCRACY CANNOT SOLELY DEPEND ON PERPETUATING THE EXISTING RULE OF LAW SYSTEM. THE ALTERNATIVE WE PROPOSE IS TO UTILIZE THE CONSTITUTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF MAN TO INITIATE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THAT WILL HALT THIS DETERIORATION. LEADERS IN THIS CONSTITUTIVE STRUCTURE ARE REQUIRED TO EXHIBIT TWO PIVOTAL QUALITIES (1) THE ABILITY TO INITIATE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE TO HALT DETERIORATION IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM; AND (2) WILLINGNESS TO SUBMIT TO THE RULE OF LAW INSITUTION ONCE IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED SO AS TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF DEMOCRACY. TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCH LEADERS ARE CHOSEN: CHARLES DE GAULLE IN FRANCE AND CHIANG CHING-KUO IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN. THEY EXEMPLIFY HOW A NON-ANTAGONISTIC AND NON-EXCTUSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF MAN CAN HELP, IN THE FORMER, TO FURTHER CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY IN A TIME OF CRISIS, AND IN THE LATTER, TO TRANSFORM AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME INTO A DEMOCRACY IN A TIME OF TRANSITION..
202	WHAT THE CURRENT SURGE OF POPULISM SHOWS IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND LIBERAL DEMOCRACY FIND THEMSELVES IN GREAT DANGER WHEN THE BREADTH OF DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR THEIR CORE PRINCIPLES BEGINS TO DECREASE. BOTH IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, THE POPULIST FORCES RELATIVELY EASILY UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY, AND STEERED POLITICS IN A DANGEROUS AUTHORITARIAN DIRECTION. ULTIMATELY, DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL PARTIES WITH CREDIBLE POLITICAL IDEAS AND PLATFORMS OFFER THE BEST HOPE FOR PROTECTION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. AS THE WESTERN EUROPEAN EXAMPLES SHOW, AS LONG AS THERE EXIST CREDIBLE LIBERAL POLITICAL PLATFORMS, THE THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY IS NOT EXISTENTIAL. WHILE POPULISTS IN WESTERN EUROPE CHALLENGE CERTAIN LIBERAL VALUES AND POLICIES, THEY LACK THE CAPACITY TO THREATEN THE ESSENCE OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
203	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN ASIA HAS UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE TRANSFORMATION OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, YET COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW HAS REMAINED PROBLEMATIC. PRESENTING A BASIC TYPOLOGY OF STATE TYPES BASED ON THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF HOW PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS SITUATED WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE IN RECENT YEARS STATES IN ASIA HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS FULLER LEGALISATION AND JUDICIALISATION OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SPACE AS PART OF A BROADER PROCESS OF INSTITUTIONAL LAYERING, THEY HAVE LARGELY FAILED TO DEEPEN ITS ENFORCEMENT IN TERMS OF UNIVERSALITY AND IMPARTIALITY. DRAWING ON EAST ASIAN BAROMETER DATA, THE ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW, BECAUSE CITIZENS' ATTITUDES HAVE GIVEN LITTLE SUPPORT TO THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, ELITES HAVE HAD LITTLE INCENTIVE TO ADVOCATE FOR REFORM. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE BROADER ORGANISATION OF STATE POWER IN ASIA WITH ITS IDEOLOGICAL EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES, SUBSTANTIAL EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL QUESTIONS ARE RAISED ABOUT THE TRAJECTORY OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE REGION.
204	VIETNAM IS IMPLEMENTING GLOBAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, SO THE LAW MUST ALSO BE RENOVATED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL INTEGRATION. BECAUSE THE LAW ATTACHED TO THE COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONS, IT SHOWS THE CONSISTENCY IN VIETNAM'S POLITICS, ECONOMY, AND DIPLOMACY. IN THE WORLD, THE RULE OF LAW IS TYPICAL VALUE THAT HUMANITY AIMS FOR BECAUSE UPHOLDS THE LAW, EXPRESSING OUR NATION'S ASPIRATION FOR A DEMOCRATIC AND EQUAL SOCIETY. THEREFORE, VIETNAM HAS BUILT A SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. TO ACHIEVE THIS, VIETNAM MUST ENSURE THE FREE POWER OF ITS CITIZENS, PROMOTE THE DEMOCRACY OF THE STATE, AND ENSURE THAT POWER BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. THE PAPER USES MATERIALIST DIALECTICAL METHOD TO EXAMINE THE BUILDING OF CIVIC CONSCIOUSNESS THAT PROMOTES THE PERFECTION OF VIETNAM'S CURRENT SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ARTICLE ALSO USES ANALYTICAL METHODS AND SYNTHETIC METHODS TO CLARIFY THE SENSE OF CITIZENSHIP IN THE VIETNAMESE STATE, VIETNAM'S POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW IS CORRECT.
205	IN RESPONSE TO NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE EU'S FUNDAMENTAL VALUES SUCH AS DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, THE EU COMMISSION HAS ESTABLISHED THE JUSTICE SCOREBOARD, THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK AND THE RULE OF LAW MECHANISM. MOREOVER, THE COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED LINKING THE DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS TO RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW (RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY). HOWEVER, THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE MEASURES HAS NOT RESTORED COMPLIANCE. DRAWING ON THE TWO DOMINANT APPROACHES IN COMPLIANCE STUDIES, THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND THE ENFORCEMENT APPROACH, THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY, THE COMMISSION'S TOOLS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND THE SOLUTIONS CHOSEN. INSTEAD OF SANCTIONING VOLUNTARY NONCOMPLIANCE, THEY RELY ON SOFT MEASURES, WHICH ARE RECOMMENDED IN CASES OF INVOLUNTARY NONCOMPLIANCE, BUT WHICH ARE NOT SUITABLE IN CASES OF DELIBERATE NONCOMPLIANCE.
206	WHILE THE RULE OF LAW IS SURELY A VERY IMPORTANT GOOD, THE FAMILIAR DISCUSSIONS FOUND IN THE LITERATURE LEAD MANY TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS EITHER A RELATIVELY TRIVIAL POLITICAL IDEAL, OR ELSE A REDUNDANT ONE. WHAT IS NEEDED IS A NEW AND PERSUASIVE DEFENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT PROPERLY REFLECTS ITS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR HUMAN WELL BEING. AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS BUILDING SUCH AN ARGUMENT IS TO QUESTION A WIDELY-SHARED BUT OFTEN UNNOTICED ASSUMPTION THAT THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A VIRTUE OF LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE PATH IS THEN CLEARED FOR A REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT BUILT ON TWO THESES: FIRST, THE THOUGHT THAT AN IDEAL SOCIETY WOULD BE ONE IN WHICH NO ONE IS THE MASTER OF ANYONE ELSE, AND SECOND, THE THOUGHT THAT OUR FREEDOM FROM DOMINATION IS NOT NATURAL OR PRE-INSTITUTIONAL.
207	THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS A HALLOWED PRINCIPLE EVEN IN THE UNPROMISING ENVIRONMENT OF COUNTERTERRORISM, BUT FAILURES TO LIVE UP TO RULE OF LAW RHETORIC MUST BE HIGHLIGHTED. AS A RESULT, ONE MIGHT QUESTION WHETHER COUNTERTERRORISM CAN REALISTICALLY BE CONDUCTED WHOLLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. SO, IS THE RULE OF LAW RHETORIC OR REALITY? IN PRACTICE, IT REMAINS EXCEPTIONAL FOR STATES TO RESORT TO EXPRESS OR WIDE DEROGATIONS FROM RULE OF LAW STANDARDS BECAUSE OF COUNTERTERRORISM, BUT NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS IN REALITY UNDERMINE THE RHETORIC OF RULE OF LAW DOMINION. BY DISSECTING THE RULE OF LAW INTO ITS CONSTITUENT COMPONENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GAIN A CLEARER PICTURE OF STRONG AND WEAK POINTS IN THE RULE OF LAW, THOUGH NO SINGLE DOCTRINE, INSTRUMENT OR INSTITUTION CAN BE FOUND TO OFFER TRANSFORMATIONAL REINFORCEMENT. IN VIEW OF THE PERMANENCE OF COUNTERTERRORISM, THE MODEL REQUIRED IS NEITHER ONE OF ACCOMMODATION NOR AN UNTHINKING ACCEPTANCE OF FRAMING IDEAS SUCH AS "THE WAR ON TERROR." INSTEAD, THE RULE OF LAW RHETORIC DEMANDS CONSTANT REFINEMENT AND RENEWAL WITHIN THE MECHANISMS OF CONSTITUTIONALISM IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE REALITY OF RULE OF LAW. THESE PRECEPTS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF COUNTERTERRORISM EXPERIENCES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
208	THIS ARTICLE DISTINGUISHES TWO TYPES OF LEGAL TECHNOLOGY: "CHEAPER LAWYERS' (OR SIMPLY REPLACING THE COGNITIVE OPERATIONS OF LAWYERS IN THEIR EXISTING DOMAINS WITH TECHNOLOGY) AND "TRANSFORMATIVE ARTIFICIAL LEGAL COGNITION' (OR INTRODUCING THE COGNITIVE OPERATIONS CHARACTERISTIC OF LAWYERS IN CONTEXTS WHERE HUMAN LAWYERS CANNOT ECONOMICALLY BE DEPLOYED AT ALL). IT THEN MAKES THE CASE FOR FINDING ADVANCES IN EGALITARIAN ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW PRIMARILY IN THE LATTER CATEGORY.
209	IN THE LAST DECADES THE INTEREST OF PHILOSOPHERS AND POLITICAL SCIENTISTS IN MARX'S THINKING IS GROWING TO RECOVER THOSE ASPECTS OF HIS THEORY THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE STILL VALID: ABOVE ALL, THE ASPIRATION TO SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN THIS PERSPECTIVE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MARXIAN CONCEPTION OF THE STATE AND THE LAW, AND THE TOTALITARIAN STATE THAT AROSE AFTER THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA. MARX'S THESIS, REJECTING THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS FUNCTIONAL TO THE DOMINATION OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS, LEGITIMISED AN INSTRUMENTAL CONCEPTION OF LAW AND THE MODEL OF POLITICAL CENTRALISATION, WHICH WAS PROVIDED FOR IN THE LENINIST PROGRAMME AND THEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE STATES OF REAL SOCIALISM. THE CURRENT DEBATE ON MARXISM CANNOT NEGLECT THE LIMITS OF MARX'S POLITICAL THEORY AND THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW OF THE LIBERAL TRADITION.
210	THE MODERNIZATION PATH OF THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW REFLECTS THE GLORIOUS PROCESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC)'S CONTINUOUS EXPLORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT. IT HAS CREATED A NEW FORM OF RULE OF LAW CIVILIZATION FOR HUMANITY, ONE THAT HAS NOT ONLY PROFOUNDLY CHANGED CHINA BUT IS ALSO DEEPLY INFLUENCING THE WORLD HISTORICAL PROCESS. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CPC, THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE ACHIEVED THE INNOVATION OF LEGAL MECHANISMS, TEXT, AND DISCOURSE IN THEIR CENTURY-LONG ENDEAVOR FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW CIVILIZATION. THE INNOVATION OF LEGAL MECHANISMS IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE MODERNIZATION OF THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW, INDICATING THAT THROUGH THE PARTY'S CENTURY-LONG ENDEAVOR FOR THE RULE OF LAW, A LEGAL LEADERSHIP MECHANISM HAS BEEN FORMED, IN WHICH THE PARTY EXERCISES OVERALL LEADERSHIP AND COORDINATES THE EFFORTS OF ALL SIDES; THE INNOVATION OF LEGAL TEXT IS THE MANIFESTATION OF MODERNIZATION OF THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW, INDICATING THAT THROUGH THE PARTY'S CENTURY-LONG ENDEAVOR FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE SOCIALIST LEGAL SYSTEM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IS GRADUALLY MOVING TOWARD A NEW STAGE OF CODIFICATION IN WHICH THE PROMULGATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS A MILESTONE; AND THE INNOVATION OF LEGAL DISCOURSE IS THE CORE OF MODERNIZATION OF THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW, INDICATING THAT THROUGH THE PARTY'S CENTURY-LONG ENDEAVOR FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE CONTINUOUS REFINEMENT OF THE CHINESE LEGAL DISCOURSE SYSTEM IS PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN PROVIDING THEORETICAL SUPPORT AND LEGAL REASONING.
211	WE PROPOSE A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE, WHICH IS CONCEIVED AS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF A SOCIETAL GAME IN WHICH ACTORS ACCEPT THE LEGITIMACY OF PUBLICLY ENUNCIATED LEGAL RULES. A META-NORM OF RESPECT FOR THE SOVEREIGN LEGAL POWER OF THE STATE IS NOT SELF-FORMING ON THE BASIS OF PRIVATE CONDUCT, BUT REQUIRES THE COEVOLUTION OF IMPERSONAL MARKET EXCHANGE WITH EFFECTIVE STATE CAPACITY TO CONSTITUTE AND REGULATE MARKETS. A FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM MUST ACQUIRE THE MEANS NOT JUST TO CONTROL PRIVATE POWER BUT TO CONSTRAIN OTHER ORGANS OF GOVERNMENT. THE EMERGENCE OF SUCH A 'SELF-LIMITING STATE' IS AN HISTORICAL PROCESS WHICH, WHILE COMPLEMENTARY TO A MARKET ORDER, IS ALSO CONTINGENT AND PATH-DEPENDENT, AND IS NOT PREORDAINED. ILLUSTRATING OUR ARGUMENT WITH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE DRAWN FROM THE CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCE OF MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES, WITH A FOCUS ON CHINA, WE ARGUE THAT ALTERNATIVES TO THE RULE OF LAW STATE, INCLUDING INTERPERSONAL TRUST, CLOSED NETWORKS AND AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL CONTROL, CAN ONLY ACHIEVE LIMITED SCALE AND SCOPE EFFECTS, AND ARE PRONE TO HIGH DEADWEIGHT COSTS ARISING FROM CORRUPTION AND THE CAPTURE OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE BY PRIVATE INTERESTS. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL OF TRANSPLANTS OF LEGAL RULES AND INSTITUTIONS TO CATALYSE THE TRANSITION TO IMPERSONAL TRADE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND PRESENT EVIDENCE, FROM TIME-SERIES ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS, THAT THE DIFFUSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION LAWS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING MARKETS. EVOLUTION TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW STATE IS, WE CONCLUDE, ONE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTAL PATH FOR MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES.
212	DESPITE HEIGHTENED ATTENTION TO CORRUPTION, MULTIPLE REFORM EFFORTS, AND DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, CORRUPTION REMAINS STUBBORNLY PERSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON CORRUPTION HIGHLIGHTS AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP LINKING CORRUPTION TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO DEMOCRACY. BUT RATHER THAN CONCENTRATE ON THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THESE CRITICAL VARIABLES, THIS RESEARCH NOTE FOCUSES ITS ATTENTION ON THE INTENSE DEBATES IN THE LITERATURE OVER HOW TO DEFINE THESE KEY CONCEPTS AND THE COMPETING DEFINITIONS. ANALYSIS DIFFERENTIATES THIN AND THICK DEFINITIONS OF EACH OF THE THREE CONCEPTS, HIGHLIGHTS THEIR SHARED EMPHASIS ON LIMITING STATE POWER AND THEIR USE OF VAGUE CRITERIA TO DEMARCATE THE CONCEPTUAL BOUNDARIES. AMID INTENSE DEBATE, ALL THREE ESSENTIALLY GROUND THEIR LIMITS ON STATE POWER ON RATHER VAGUE NOTIONS OF JUSTICE, EQUALITY, OR THE COMMON OR PUBLIC GOOD. THE MAIN ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT IN MANY CASES THIS RESULTS IN A CONCEPTUAL OVERLAP AND BLURRED BOUNDARIES. DEPENDING ON THE DEFINITION EMPLOYED, CORRUPTION CAN BE SEEN AS CONCEPTUALLY EMBEDDED WITHIN THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH, IN TURN, IS ENCOMPASSED WITHIN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY. AT ONE LEVEL, THESE COMMON CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS POTENTIALLY FASHION TAUTOLOGIES AND OXYMORA, COMPLICATING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THEM: IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE FOR A COUNTRY TO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AND STRONG RULE OF LAW? OR HIGH LEVELS OF CORRUPTION AND YET STILL BE CONSIDERED DEMOCRATIC? AT AN EMPIRICAL LEVEL, THE CONCEPTUAL OVERLAP COMPLICATES THE EXAMINATION OF SUCH THEORETICAL LINKAGES BECAUSE OF ENDOGENEITY POTENTIAL. I ILLUSTRATE THIS PROBLEM BRIEFLY BY NOTING HOW IN SOME CASES THE INDICES OF DEMOCRACY ENCOMPASS MEASURES OF THE RULE OF LAW OR CORRUPTION, AND VICE VERSA. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING HOW DISAGGREGATING THE CONCEPTS RAISES OTHER INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES.
213	THE ARTICLE OFFERS A SUCCINCT CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR APPROACHING THE 'GREAT RULE OF LAW DEBATE' CURRENTLY UNFOLDING IN THE EU (EUROPEAN UNION) AND THE CONTENDING POSITIONS OF THE VARIOUS EU INSTITUTIONS EMBROILED IN IT. IT ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGE OF CONCEPTUALIZATION IMBUED IN THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT PROVIDED BY THE EC (EUROPEAN COMMISSION). IT THEN DEMONSTRATES THAT OVER THE COURSE OF MODERN EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, THE RULE OF LAW EMERGED AS A CENTRAL DIMENSION IN FOUR DISTINCT CORE AREAS OF EC/EU IDENTITY AND ACTIVITY. SHOULD THE CONTEMPORARY CRISIS OF FOUNDATIONAL VALUES PERSIST OR DEEPEN, EACH OF THE FOUR IS EXPECTED TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE EMERGING 'RULE OF LAW TURN' IN THE EU.
214	IN THIS BRIEF NOTE I QUESTION, IN PART, THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THINKING THAT THE US SUPREME COURT SHOULD IN A RECENT OPINION CONSIDER THE RULE OF LAW. I FURTHER CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID IN FACT FAIL TO DO SO. I TAKE AN INTROSPECTIVE APPROACH TO THIS QUESTION AND EXPLORE THE VALIDITY OF US RULE OF LAW-PEOPLE TAKING A RULE OF LAW-CENTRIC VIEW OF THE WORLD. IN THIS RESPECT, I DO NOT FORENSICALLY EXAMINE THE COURT'S OPINION NOR DO I QUESTION ITS GENERAL ACCURACY OR ACCEPTABILITY. INSTEAD, I CONSIDER THE OMISSION OF ANY MENTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF BOTH THE COURT'S PRESENTATION OF AN ARGUMENT AND OUR CONSIDERATION AS READERS OF A JOURNAL WITH A SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW-CENTRIC FOCUS OF THE SAME. I CONCLUDE THAT, WHILST IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY RULE OF LAW RELATED ISSUES ALMOST ANYWHERE, AND IT MAY BE PROBLEMATIC TO SEEK TO DO SO IN EVERY INSTANCE, THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. THE COURT'S OPINION WAS ONE SUCH PLACE.
215	THE ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES IS ALMOST ALWAYS DRIVEN BY THE REGULATION THAT IS INTERDEPENDENT WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHORS OF THE ARTICLE CONSIDER THE ACEMOGLU, VERDIER (2000) MODEL IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGYTO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW LEADS TO A MORE EFFICIENT ESTABLISHMENT OF POLLUTION ABATEMENT STANDARD, THE NEUTRALIZATION OF EVEN LOW LEVELS OF POLLUTION AND THE ADOPTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY. A MORE STRINGENT RULE OF LAW CONTRIBUTES TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SECOND-BEST ALLOCATION WITH LESS RESOURCE DRAINAGE CAUSED BY THE RENT-SEEKING ACTIVITIES AND WITH LOWER INTERVENTION COSTS. IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT IN ORDER TO AVOID TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION FAILURES, IT IS NECESSARY TO TIGHTEN THE RULE OF LAW TO GUARANTEE EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
216	ON THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS AXIOMATIC THAT THE STATE MAY ONLY ACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD ACCORDING TO LAW, AND NOT ARBITRARILY, ON PAIN OF FORFEITING ITS AUTHORITY. THAT AXIOM IS A GREAT LEGACY OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES' ANTI-ABSOLUTIST REVOLUTIONS. THE SAME PERIOD YIELDED ANOTHER AXIOM, SELDOM NOTICED THOUGH NONETHELESS MOMENTOUS. IT IS THE BELIEF, USUALLY TACIT, THAT THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD NOT ADDRESS THE POTENTIALLY ARBITRARY POWER OF EMPLOYERS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ORIGINS OF THAT AXIOM IN THE WORK OF JOHN LOCKE, ONE OF THE FOUNTAINHEADS OF THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT TRADITION. ACCORDING TO THE WAY OF SEEING POWER THAT LOCKE PROPAGATED, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO REASON TO WONDER WHETHER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE MODERN EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP IS HOSPITABLE TO ARBITRARY POWER, IN THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT SENSE. EQUALLY, THERE SEEMS TO BE NO POINT IN ASKING WHETHER THE LEGITIMACY OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP SHOULD DEPEND UPON ITS BEING CONSTITUTED ACCORDING TO LIMITED GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS. HOWEVER, AS I DEMONSTRATE, SUCH IMPRESSIONS ARE AT ODDS WITH KEY MORAL AND EMPIRICAL FEATURES OF LOCKE'S OWN ANALYSIS. THOSE TENSIONS REPRESENT A CHALLENGE NOT ONLY FOR LOCKE'S ANALYSIS, BUT ALSO FOR THE LIBERAL RULE OF LAW PROJECT THAT LOCKE HELPED TO FOUND. IT IS A CHALLENGE THAT THE TRADITION IS YET TO ADDRESS.
217	WE REVIEW THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC THEORY IN SHAPING THE PROCESS OF LEGAL CHANGE IN RUSSIA DURING THE TWO TRANSITIONS IT EXPERIENCED DURING THE COURSE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: THE TRANSITION TO A SOCIALIST ECONOMY ORGANISED ALONG THE LINES OF STATE OWNERSHIP OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION IN THE 1920S, AND THE TRANSITION TO A MARKET ECONOMY WHICH OCCURRED AFTER THE FALL OF THE SOVIET UNION IN THE 1990S. DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN METHODOLOGY AND IN POLICY IMPLICATIONS, MARXIST THEORY, DOMINANT IN THE 1920S, AND NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS, DOMINANT IN THE 1990S, OFFERED A SIMILARLY REDUCTIVE ACCOUNT OF LAW AS SUBSERVIENT TO WIDER ECONOMIC FORCES. IN BOTH CASES, THE SUBORDINATE PLACE ACCORDED TO LAW UNDERMINED THE TRANSITION PROCESS. ALTHOUGH PATH DEPENDENCE AND HISTORY ARE FREQUENTLY INVOKED TO EXPLAIN THE LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA DURING THE 1990S, POLICY CHOICES DRIVEN BY A DETERMINISTIC CONCEPTION OF LAW AND ECONOMICS ALSO PLAYED A ROLE.
218	A PERSISTENT CRITIQUE IN SURVEILLANCE STUDIES HAS BEEN THAT PRIVACY IS A LIMITED, LEGALISTIC, AND HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED CONCEPT, ILL-SUITED TO ADDRESS CONTEMPORARY PRACTICES OF SURVEILLANCE. RECENT CANADIAN CHARTER CASES SEEM TO CONFIRM THAT CRITIQUE, PERMITTING POLICE ACCESS TO A WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION THAT MANY WOULD ARGUE IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF INFORMATION GATHERED THROUGH EMERGING FORMS OF SURVEILLANCE. HOWEVER, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT INSTEAD OF JETTISONING PRIVACY WE SHOULD INSTEAD SEEK A RICHER LEGAL UNDERSTANDING OF PRIVACY. IN PARTICULAR, I ARGUE THAT THE HISTORICAL ROOTS OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY JURISPRUDENCE ARE RULE OF LAW IDEAS. MANY OF THE CORE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE IMPLICITLY SHAPED OUR LEGAL DEFINITION OF PRIVACY BUT HAVE DONE SO IN A VERY PARTIAL MANNER AND IN A MANNER THAT SUPPORTS A VERY NARROW CONCEPTION OF PRIVACY. THE IRONIC CONSEQUENCE IS THAT THE LEGAL DISCOURSE OF PRIVACY NOW OFTEN HELPS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS RATHER THAN CONSTRAIN IT. IN ORDER TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO NEW FORMS OF SURVEILLANCE, OUR PRIVACY JURISPRUDENCE REQUIRES A MORE EXPLICIT FOCUS AND RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEMANDS OF THESE CORE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES.
219	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW CHILDREN'S LITERATURE SHEDS LIGHT ON COMMON UNDERSTANDINGS AND BACKGROUND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ANGLO-NORTH AMERICAN CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THREE POPULAR TEXTS FROM CHILDREN'S LITERATURE-LEWIS CARROLL'S ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND AND THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, NORTON JUSTERS THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH, AND J. K. ROWLINGS HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX-OFFER A FAMILIAR BASIS FROM WHICH TO CONSIDER THE SOCIAL IMAGINARY OF THE RULE OF LAW. EACH TEXT ACTS AS ITS OWN CASE STUDY DISCLOSING TROUBLING DEFICIENCIES IN A FICTIONAL PUBLIC LAW ORDER AND PROMPTING A CONSIDERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW'S COMPATIBILITY WITH COMMAND AND CONTROL MODES OF RULE, A REFLECTION ABOUT ITS MINIMUM MORAL CONTENT, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE SUCH AS HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSES. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THESE THREE ENCOUNTERS WITH FICTIONAL LEGAL ORDERS CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A POLITICAL GOOD, A PUBLIC DISCOURSE, AND A CONSTITUTIVE COMPONENT OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP.
220	THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE OF LAW IS TOUTED AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS IN BURMA (MYANMAR) TODAY, YET ITS MEANING IS HIGHLY CONTESTED AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF MILITARY RULE. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE HOW THE RULE OF LAW IN BURMA'S TRANSITIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE LEGACIES OF MILITARY RULE AND THE GOVERNMENT'S DEVELOPMENT POLICIES SINCE 2011. A SERIES OF LAWS INTRODUCED BY THE THEIN SEIN GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RUBRIC OF RULE OF LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT UPON SMALL HOLD FARMERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHILE SOME LAWS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FARMERS AND THEIR LAND, OTHERS ENCOURAGED PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE LAND USED BY FARMERS. THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THESE LAWS WAS TO FORMALISE THE PATTERN OF LAND GRABBING THAT HAD DEVELOPED UNDER THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND TO ENCOURAGE LAND SPECULATION. MOREOVER, THEY SHOW HOW AN EXPEDITED PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW INCITED CONFLICT AND FURTHER INJUSTICE. ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE AND A MORE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW MUST KEEP PACE WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S LIMITED ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL CAPACITIES. WHETHER, AND HOW FAR, BURMA CAN DEVELOP AND MOVE BEYOND A THIN OR PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW WILL BE TESTED AS THE COUNTRY EXPERIENCES LIFE UNDER THE NLD GOVERNMENT.
221	THE TECHNOCRATIC PROJECT OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CONFLICT PEACEBUILDING IS ADVANCED AS A GUARANTOR OF LIBERAL PEACE. THIS RULE OF LAW FABLE THAT CORRELATES PEACE WITH TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS OF WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEMS RECALLS THE COLONIAL AND MODERNISATION ETHOS TO ENGINEER AFRICAN SOCIETIES IN OUR OWN IMAGE. AS SUCH, AS IN THE CASE OF SIERRA LEONE, PRACTICES OF LAW THAT DO NOT CONFORM TO THE INTERVENTIONARY CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE RENDERED PATHOLOGICAL. SPECIFICALLY, CULTURE IS POSITIONED AS A PROBLEM FOR PEACEBUILDERS TO SOLVE. THERE IS NOT, HOWEVER, A HOMOGENEOUS RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM OF CULTURE, BUT STRATEGIC DIVERSITY: ASSIMILATION, UNDERPINNED BY LIBERAL CLAIMS TO CULTURAL NEUTRALITY, AIMS TO PRODUCE CULTURAL SAMENESS BY COMBATING CUSTOM AND TRADITION. ACCOMMODATION THAT DOMESTICATES LOCAL TRADITION REPRESENTS A RADICALLY DEPOLITICISED MULTICULTURALISM, WHILE DEPLOYMENT MOBILISES TRADITION TO ENCOURAGE BUY-IN TO THE RULE OF LAW PROJECT.
222	THE CALL TO ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF CHINA'S STRATEGIC MOVE TO A GREAT MODERN COUNTRY. IN MODERN TIMES, WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE APPLIED RULE OF LAW PRACTICES IN THEIR MODERNIZATION, DEMONSTRATING THE VALUES OF A SOUND RULE OF LAW SYSTEM FOR NATIONAL STRENGTH. IN PARTICULAR, THE RULE OF LAW, EXTENDED BEYOND NATIONAL BORDERS, PROVIDES A CRUCIAL GUARANTEE FOR A GREAT MODERN COUNTRY'S SUSTAINED, STABLE, AND HEALTHY PATH, AND IS ALSO A CLEAR SYMBOL OF A COUNTRY'S SOFT POWER. AS CHINA IS PROGRESSING TO BECOME A GREAT MODERN COUNTRY, THERE IS A NEED TO PAY A PARTICULARLY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE RULE OF LAW, ACTIVELY PROMOTING THE LEGALIZATION OF FOREIGN-RELATED WORK. CHINA'S STANCE ON THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS SHOULD INCLUDE BOTH A PRINCIPLE OF DEFENDING ITS CORE INTERESTS AND A PRINCIPLE OF ADVOCATING SHARED VALUES AND OF PROMOTING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL COOPERATION. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS ERA, CHINA'S INTERNATIONAL LAW PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD DELVE INTO APPROPRIATE MODELS THAT CAN FACILITATE SMOOTH PROGRESS ON THE PATH TO MODERNIZATION, FURTHER ENHANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA AND THE SUCCESSFUL EMERGENCE OF A GREAT MODERN COUNTRY.
223	A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS A COMMITMENT TO THE GOVERNANCE OF A SOCIETY THROUGH THE USE OF GENERAL OR GENERALISABLE RULES WHICH ARE BINDING ON BOTH THE SUBJECTS AND THE RULERS. BY GIVING DUE NOTICE OF THE RULES AND OF ANY CHANGES TO THEM, THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE LAW ARE PROTECTED FROM VIOLENCE AND ENABLED TO ACT AS AGENTS. THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTION THE RULE OF LAW MAKES TO IMPORTANT HUMAN GOODS INCLUDING FREEDOM. SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW ILLUMINATES WHY THE LAW-LIKE CHARACTER OF GOD AND THE REVELATION OF GOD'S LAW MAKE HUMAN FREE WILL MEANINGFUL AND A RELATIONSHIP OF LOVE BETWEEN GOD AND HUMAN BEINGS POSSIBLE. A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW ALSO MEANS THAT THOSE EXERCISING POWER HAVE TO OFFER JUSTIFICATIONS TO EXPLAIN WHY THE RULES ARE BINDING, WHICH OPENS UP SPACE FOR DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE RULES ARE JUST.
224	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF BILATERAL FOREIGN AID IN SUPPORTING THE DIFFUSION AND ENACTMENT OF COMMON MODELS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AMONG AID-RECIPIENT LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. WE ASK WHETHER AID TARGETED AT SECURITY-SECTOR REFORM AND THE RULE OF LAW INFLUENCES THE ADOPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL REFORMS OVER TIME (INSTITUTIONAL DIFFUSION), AND WHETHER AID ALSO SUPPORTS MORE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WRIT LARGE (LEGAL REACH). WE USE EVENT HISTORY AND FIXED-EFFECTS PANEL REGRESSION MODELS TO EXAMINE A SAMPLE OF 154 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1995 AND 2013 TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AID DOES INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADOPTING SEVERAL RULE OF LAW REFORMS, BUT ITS EFFECT ON INCREASING THE DEPTH OR QUALITY OF RULE OF LAW OVER TIME WITHIN COUNTRIES IS MUCH LESS SUBSTANTIAL. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THOUGH AID MAY PLAY A ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE DIFFUSION OF MODELS CONTRIBUTING TO STATE ISOMORPHISM AMONG COUNTRIES, IT IS LESS EFFECTIVE AT INCREASING THE PERVASIVENESS AND QUALITY OF SUCH MODEL'S IMPLEMENTATION. THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BILATERAL AID IN PROMOTING LAW ON THE BOOKS VERSUS LAW IN ACTION IN AID RECIPIENT COUNTRIES CALLS INTO QUESTION THE CURRENT APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW REFORMS.
225	HUMAN DIGNITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF A DEMOCRATIC AND THE RULE-OF-LAW STATE, WITHOUT WHICH THE RULE OF LAW CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED AND FULLY EXCERCISED. THE RULE OF LAW RESTRICTS THE ARBITRARINESS OF STATE POWER AND STRONG INTEREST GROUPS BY PROTECTING THE DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. HUMAN DIGNITY IS NOT CONDITIONED BY THE WORLDVIEW OF AN INDIVIDUAL, BUT BELONGS TO HIM FROM THE MERE FACT THAT HE IS A HUMAN BEING. IT IS THUS DIRECTLY LINKED TO HUMAN LIFE AND THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND ITS REALIZATION. THE RULE OF LAW IS UNCONDITIONALLY LINKED TO HUMAN DIGNITY, SINCE IT REGULATES THE FUNCTIONING OF A DEMOCRATIC AND THE RULE-OF-LAW STATE. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION THEREFORE ADDRESSES HUMAN DIGNITY AS THE BASIS FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE FIRST PART, HUMAN DIGNITY IS DEFINED AND ANALYZED AS A CORNERSTONE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND PART THEN PRESENTS AND ANALYZES THE CASE LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF SLOVENIA. THE THIRD PART GIVES SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS CONCRETIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE SLOVENIAN SOCIETY. HUMAN DIGNITY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH EVERY SOCIETY MUST IMPLEMENT AND PROTECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE.
226	LEGAL CHANGE IS CLEARLY THE AREA OF GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IN POST-MAO CHINA, WHEN COMPARED WITH MAO'S CHINA. POST-MAO LEGISLATIVE REFORMS AND CHANGES HAVE LED MANY CHINA ANALYSTS TO DECLARE THAT THE POST-MAO REGIME HAS FOLLOWED THE MODEL OF SOME EAST ASIAN AUTHORITARIAN COUNTRIES AND MOVED TOWARD THE "RULE OF LAW," A PROCESS WHICH HAS BROUGHT ABOUT A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. HOWEVER, A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE WILL SUGGEST THAT THE "RULE OF LAW" IS ONLY AN ILLUSION OR WISHFUL THINKING THAT CONTRADICTS THE CENTRAL REALITY OF THE POST-MAO LEGAL SYSTEM AND MISINTERPRETS THE NATURE OF POST-MAO LEGAL CHANGES AND REFORMS. THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CHANGE IN, A LEGAL SYSTEM SHOULD NOR DEPEND AN HOW MANY LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED BUT RATHER ON HOW THESE LAWS OPERATE WITHIN WHAT KIND OF LEGAL FRAMEWORK; WHO DEFINES THE PRINCIPLES, NORMS, AND RULES OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK; AND WHO MAKER THE LAW. THE LATTER, RATHER THAN THE FORMER, DETERMINES THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES ONE KEY ASPECT OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME. THE FINDINGS OF THIS WORK SUGGEST THAT THE POST-MAO LEGAL AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS HAVE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE CORE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEGISLATURE AND LAW AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT BROUGHT ABOUT A SYSTEMIC OR FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. ALL THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST CONSTITUTION AND THE NATURE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST LEGAL SYSTEM REMAIN UNCHANGED DESPITE THE LAWMAKING ACHIEVEMENTS MADE IN THE LAST DECADES.
227	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY COMPARING JAMAICA AND BARBADOS, TWO COUNTRIES WITH MANY SIMILARITIES, BUT WITH DIVERGENT OUTCOMES CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW. THE RESEARCH TAKES A COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL APPROACH, SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINS OF THE DIVERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW BETWEEN JAMAICA AND BARBADOS BY FOCUSING ON THE LATE COLONIAL PERIOD (1937-1966). USING NEW DATA COLLECTED FROM ARCHIVAL RESEARCH, STATE LEGITIMACY IS IDENTIFIED AS THE KEY FACTOR THAT HELPS EXPLAIN THE DIVERGENT TRAJECTORIES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN JAMAICA AND BARBADOS POST-INDEPENDENCE. GOING BEYOND STATE-BASED EXPLANATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE RULE OF LAW NOT ONLY DEPENDS ON CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE, BUT ALSO ON CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIETY.

228	THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE POSITIONS OF POLITICAL PARTIES AROUND THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THEIR POSITION IN THIS CRISIS? THE THEORETICAL EXPECTATIONS FOCUS ON POPULISM AND GOVERNMENT STATUS AS THE DRIVERS OF PARTY POSITIONS TOWARDS A MEMBER STATE VIOLATING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THESE EXPECTATIONS THROUGH A COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY OF THE ACTIONS OF DIFFERENT EU POLITICAL PARTIES DURING THE FIRST TERM OF THE LAW AND JUSTICE GOVERNMENT IN POLAND (2015-2019). THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTS SUCH AS DEBATES AND RESOLUTIONS OF PARLIAMENTS WITHIN THE EU. IT CONCLUDES THAT POPULIST PARTIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE LAW AND JUSTICE PARTY THAN MAINSTREAM PARTIES, AND THAT PARTIES IN GOVERNMENT ARE LESS LIKELY TO CHALLENGE LAW AND JUSTICE THAN OPPOSITION PARTIES. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHTS INTO THE DYNAMICS OF PARTIES' POSITIONING ON THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS.
229	THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS SEVERELY AFFECTED SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. AN ECONOMIC CRISIS CAN ALSO UNDERMINE A STATE'S INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ABILITY TO FULLY MAINTAIN THE RULE OF LAW AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS OF ITS POPULATION. THIS ARTICLE THEREFORE EXAMINES THE THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND AN ECONOMIC CRISIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT ATTEMPTS TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC CRISIS, SOCIOECONOMIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW BY CRITICALLY EXAMINING THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IT ASKS ONE MAIN QUESTION: DO STATES HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN STANDARDS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS DURING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS? FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT STATES ARE OBLIGED TO MAINTAIN DURING THE ECONOMIC CRISES A REASONABLE MINIMUM CORE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND NOT TO LOWER THE STANDARDS OF RULE OF LAW.
230	THIS ARTICLE BRINGS TOGETHER DEBATES IN STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND LEGAL INTERPRETATION. EXAMINING THEORETICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE INCORPORATES A GREATER ATTENTION TO QUESTIONS OF INTERPRETIVISM AND THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE INTERPRETER IN ORDER TO GIVE CONTEXTUAL CONTENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. CONSTRUING RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGAL INTERPRETATION (E.G., DISCRETION, DETERMINACY, OBJECTIVITY), THE ARTICLE PROPOSES VIEWING RULE OF LAW AS A BOUNDED CLAIM SPACE IN ORDER TO FRONT THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT SPACE AS FOCAL POINTS FOR RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS. REVIEWING VARIOUS PRESUMPTIONS OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION IN CANADIAN JURISPRUDENCE, THE ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT THESE PRESUMPTIONS ARE PROXIES FOR THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS THAT DEFINE, DEMARCATE, AND DELIMIT A DISTINCTIVELY CANADIAN RULE OF LAW TRADITION, THEREBY SHOWCASING THE ANALYTIC HEFT AND LIMITED SCOPE OF RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS.
231	RECENTLY, SEVERAL MUSLIM COUNTRIES HAVE RATIFIED NEW CONSTITUTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ASK TWO QUESTIONS: FIRST, WHETHER MUSLIM INFLUENCE HAS A DISCERNIBLE IMPACT ON THE CONTENT OF SUCH CONSTITUTIONS AND, SECOND, WHETHER IT HAS AN IMPACT ON CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY. MORE PRECISELY, WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF ISLAM FOR INSTITUTIONS SECURING THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE TAKING COMPETING SOCIOECONOMIC, GEOGRAPHIC, AND HISTORICAL EXPLANATIONS EXPLICITLY INTO ACCOUNT. TO THIS END, WE CONSTRUCT A NEW ISLAMIC STATE INDEX TO MEASURE THE INFLUENCE THAT ISLAM HAS ON A SOCIETY AND ITS POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM. WE FIND THAT MUSLIM INFLUENCE IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND NONDISCRIMINATORY LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO GENDER. YET, PARLIAMENTARY POWER AS WELL AS THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS MINORITIES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONSTRAINED IN ISLAMIC STATES AFTER WE CONTROL FOR ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS. COMPETING EXPLANATIONS SUCH AS THE SIZE OF OIL RENTS FARE RATHER POORLY IN EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
232	IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT A COMPETENT LEGAL PROFESSION IS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE OF THE CHINESE NATIONAL UNIFORM JUDICIAL EXAMINATION IN PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF THE EXAMINATION PAPERS, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE JUDICIAL EXAMINATION IS MOSTLY AIMED AT THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS OF LAW REFLECTED IN A FORMAL OR "THIN" RULE OF LAW. THE QUESTIONS INDICATE A TURNING AWAY FROM THE RULE-BY-LAW MODEL. ONLY A FEW QUESTIONS TOUCH ON ISSUES THAT DIFFERENTIATE COMPETING SUBSTANTIVE OR "THICK" CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SMALL PART OF THE EXAMINATION GENERALLY REFLECTS A NON-LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ALTHOUGH SOME POINTS ARE SO BROADLY STATED THAT THEY CAN EVEN BE RECONCILED WITH A LIBERAL RULE-OF-LAW MODEL. THE LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNICAL LEGAL SKILLS THAT ARE THE SUBJECTS OF THE EXAMINATION REFLECT AN INCREASED PROFESSIONALISM OF THE LAW IN CHINA AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL PROFESSION SIMILAR TO THAT IN LIBERAL RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEMS.
233	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT NO MATTER WHICH DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW ONE ADOPTS, THERE ARE RULES OF LAW THAT ARE IN TENSION WITH THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE RULE OF LAW IS INDEED A 'RULE', WHICH OFTEN DEMANDS PRIMACY, LEGAL SYSTEMS FACILITATE DEPARTURES FROM THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH JUDICIALLY DEVELOPED RULES OF LAW, FOR EXAMPLE, STANDING, POLITICAL QUESTIONS, IMMUNITY, AND SUSPENSIONS OF INVALIDITY. THESE JUDGE-MADE RULES GIVE PUBLIC OFFICIALS FLEXIBILITY IN THE OBSERVANCE OF OTHER RULES. THEIR EFFECT (THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY PURPOSE) IS TO ALLAY THE OFTEN STRICT DEMANDS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY HELPING PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEGOTIATE THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE POINT OF DISREGARDING THE RULES THAT THEY ARE OTHERWISE BOUND TO OBEY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS THUS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT DEMONSTRATES HOW THE RULE OF LAW EXISTS ALONGSIDE OTHER RULES OF LAW. IN CASES OF CONFLICT, THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT NOT HAVE THE UPPER HAND. SECOND, AND MORE IMPORTANT, THE THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT JUST EXOGENOUS TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM, BUT ALSO ENDOGENOUS; IT IS THE RESULT OF A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT ROUTINELY PROFESSES ITS COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW, BUT ALSO CREATES AND MAINTAINS RULES THAT UNDERMINE THE VERY VALUE THAT THE SYSTEM IS COMMITTED TO PRESERVING. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE NOT CONFLATE COURTS WITH THE RULE OF LAW. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM VIEWS COURTS AS INSTITUTIONS DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS, OF COURSE, TRUE. BUT THE SAME CONVENTIONAL WISDOM GIVES SHORT SHRIFT TO THE NOTION THAT COURTS MIGHT ALSO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I SHOW HOW, BY CREATING, DEVELOPING, AND SUSTAINING RULES OF LAW, COURTS CAN ALSO DO VIOLENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW.
234	RECENT SCHOLARSHIP HAS EXPOSED THE "EU'S PATHOLOGICAL POWER", WHICH HAS UNDERMINED THE CREATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE (SEE) AND BEYOND. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE "PATHOLOGICAL TURN" IN EUROPEANIZATION STUDIES BY IDENTIFYING AND PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR SEVERAL "PATHOLOGIES OF EUROPEANIZATION", I.E. LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEFICIENCIES RELATED TO RULE OF LAW REFORM, SUCH AS LEGAL INSTABILITY, LACK OF GENERALITY AND ENFORCEMENT, AND INCREASED POLITICIZATION. THESE PATHOLOGIES RESULT, AMONG OTHERS, FROM A DEFICIENT APPROACH OF THE EU TO RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AND ASSESSMENT. IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHOR HIGHLIGHTS THREE MAIN FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF EUROPEANIZATION IN THE AREA OF THE RULE OF LAW: 1) VALUING QUANTITY OVER QUALITY; 2) PARTISAN EMPOWERMENT OF DOMESTIC CHANGE AGENTS; AND 3) BIASED ASSESSMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THESE PROBLEMATIC ISSUES ARE FURTHER CLARIFIED ON SELECTED COUNTRY EXAMPLES OF REFORM FAILURE FROM SEE AND THE 2012 "RULE OF LAW CRISIS" IN ROMANIA. IT IS ARGUED THAT GIVEN THE EU'S INABILITY TO OBJECTIVELY ASSESS AND EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, THE EU SHOULD EITHER ABSTAIN FROM EVALUATING RULE OF LAW OR RADICALLY REVISE ITS APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY, FOR INSTANCE BY FOLLOWING THE POLICY ADVICE PROVIDED IN THIS PAPER.
235	BY TAKING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AS A PRINCIPAL FOCAL POINT, THIS CHAPTER WILL EVALUATE CRITICALLY THE RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES ARISING FROM THE PRODUCTION AND OPERATION OF COUNTERTERRORISM NORMS. THE ARTICLE WILL FOCUS ON FOUR CASE STUDIES, TWO INVOLVING THE RULE OF LAW EX ANTE (AT THE STAGE OF ADOPTION OF EU LAW) AND TWO INVOLVING THE RULE OF LAW EX POST (LOOKING AT ITS IMPACT). IN TERMS OF EX ANTE RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES, THE CHAPTER WILL ANALYSE THE PRODUCTION OF BINDING STANDARDS BY THE GLOBAL EXECUTIVE AND THE TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT OF THESE STANDARDS AT THE REGIONAL, EU AND NATIONAL LEVEL AND THE LIMITS OF SCRUTINY AND JUSTIFICATION OF COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION ON EMERGENCY GROUNDS. IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW EX POST, THE CHAPTER WILL EXAMINE CHALLENGES OF COUNTERTERRORISM LAW TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY VIA OVER-CRIMINALISATION AND THE ADOPTION OF VAGUE AND BROAD DEFINITIONS OF TERRORISM, AS WELL AS CHALLENGES TO THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION RESULTING FROM STATE ARBITRARINESS IN THE MECHANISM OF PRODUCING TERRORIST SANCTIONS. THE CONTRIBUTION WILL QUESTION WHETHER THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE LISBON TREATY, AND THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF CRIMINAL LAW IT ENTAILED, HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE REGARDING THE COMPLIANCE OF EU COUNTERTERRORISM LAW WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
236	IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED COUNTRIES, SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL, PEACEKEEPING AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED TO PREVENTING FUTURE CONFLICT, FREQUENTLY THROUGH THE USE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, OFTEN LINKED TO PROMOTING PEACE AGREEMENTS WITH SPECIFIC GOVERNANCE MEASURES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GOALS AND THE SCALE OF RESOURCES COMMITTED, THE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH MEASURES PROMOTE PEACE IS MIXED. FURTHER, THE WAY IN WHICH THESE MEASURES INTERACT, POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY, HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ANALYSED BY ACADEMICS OR PRACTITIONERS. DRAWING ON THE AUTHOR'S YEARS OF FIELDWORK IN SIERRA LEONE, UGANDA, COLOMBIA, KENYA, SRI LANKA AND SUDAN, AMONG OTHERS, THIS POLICY NOTE ELABORATES ON THE CHALLENGES OF USING LAW FOR PEACE THROUGH GOVERNANCE AND RULE OF LAW MEASURES, AS WELL AS THROUGH TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE.
237	RECONCILING CONFLICT BETWEEN RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS AND NON-RELIGIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS IS A SUBJECT THAT HAS BEGUN TO AFFECT MANY COUNTRIES AS THEY HAVE BECOME MORE LIBERAL, MULTICULTURAL AND SECULAR. THE LAW RELEVANT TO THE SUBJECT IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING AT A FAST PACE, AND IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN ENGLAND AND WALES GIVEN THE HISTORICAL POSITION THAT CHRISTIANITY HAS HAD WITHIN THE ESTABLISHMENT - THE MONARCHY, PARLIAMENT AND THE LAW. THIS ARTICLE CHARTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW IN THESE AREAS FROM AN ERA OF OFFICIALLY PROTESTANT UNIFORMITY TO THE CURRENT PLURAL AND TOLERANT SOCIETY. THE FAST PACE OF DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR, IS SHOWN THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW IN THE FIELDS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, DISCRIMINATION ON THE GROUNDS OF SEXUALITY, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND DISCRIMINATION. TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THE LAW HAS NOW BECOME NEUTRAL TOWARDS RELIGION AND BELIEF AND PROVIDES AN ENLARGED SPACE WHERE, SUBJECT ONLY TO LEGITIMATE INTERFERENCE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THAT FREEDOM AND THE RULE OF LAW, ALL ARE FREE TO ADHERE TO THEIR OWN FAITH AND BELIEF SYSTEM.
238	THE MANAGEMENT OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS HAS THE MODE OF "POLICY","LEGALITY", "RULE OF LAW" AND SO ON. IN THE PAST REFORMED 40 YEARS, CHINA'S RELIGIOUS MANAGEMENT POLICY HAS A CONSISTENT CONTENT, AND THE POLICY HAS ALWAYS HELD THE HIGHEST POSITION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SINCE THE 1990S, RELIGIOUS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN "LEGALIZED" GRADUALLY. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS ORDINANCE ISSUED IN 2004 MARKED THE MANAGEMENT MODE OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS IN CHINA ENTERED THE ERA THAT MANAGING RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS. IN 2014,THE FOURTH PLENARY SESSION OF THE 18TH CPP CENTRAL COMMITTEE PROPOSED "INTEGRATION BUILDING FOR RULE OF LAW COUNTRY, RULE OF LAW GOVERNMENT AND RULE OF LAW SOCIETY". IN 2016, THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RELIGIOUS WORK PROPOSED "IMPROVING THE RULE OF LAW IN RELIGIOUS WORK", RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME THE GOAL OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS MANAGEMENT. RULE OF LAW IN RELIGION HAS FACTORS SUCH AS "RIGHTS PROTECTION","SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE", "PUBLIC POWER RESTRICTION" AND SO ON. THE MANAGEMENT OF RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS IN CHINA NEEDS TO GO BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL MODE SUCH AS "POLICY" AND "LEGALITY". THE "RULE OF LAW" MODE OF GOOD LAW AND GOOD GOVERNANCE IS THE INEVITABLE CHOICE.
239	THE REPORT OF THE 18TH CPC NATIONAL CONGRESS IN 2012 EMPHASIZES BUILDING A SOCIALIST COUNTRY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AS CHINA'S OVERALL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY. AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS EXPANDED THE "FOUR IN ONE" TO "FIVE IN ONE"; I.E. THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE OTHER MAJOR TASKS IN SOCIALIST CONSTRUCTION WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS-ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION, POLITICAL CONSTRUCTION, CULTURAL CONSTRUCTION, AND SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION, THUS SETTING OUT THE ROADMAP FOR CHINA'S CONSTRUCTION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE AIM OF THIS CONSTRUCTION IS TO ESTABLISH AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL SYSTEM THAT CORRESPONDS TO CHINA'S ECOLOGICAL CIVILIZATION, AND ITS MAIN TASK IS TO INTEGRATE ENVIRONMENTAL RATIONALITY INTO THE OPERATION OF THE RULE OF LAW BY IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL MECHANISMS AND INSTITUTIONS.
240	THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRE, AS A PRECONDITION, THAT A NORMAL SITUATION EXISTS. TH E ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS SCHMITTIAN IDEA CAN BE TRANSPOSED TO AN INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ON THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. TH E CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS PROPOSED BY SCHMITT IN 'LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY' FOCUSING IN HIS SEARCH FOR AN ETHOS OF LAW WERE IN THE CONCRETE SITUATION OF WEIMAR, NEITHER ATTUNED TO THE LEGAL SPIRIT OF THE TIMES (POSITIVISM) NOR SUITED TO TAKING A COURSE OF ACTION IN THE MIDST OF TUMULTUOUS POLITICAL EVENTS. HOWEVER, AS A THEORETICAL WORK ON LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM 'LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY' CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE LACK OF INHERENT RATIONALITY OF THE LIBERAL (INTERNATIONAL) RULE OF LAW: THE ETHOS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN OUTSIDER. TH E FI NAL PART OF THE ARTICLE USES THE EXAMPLE OF THE MANDATE SYSTEM OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS TO SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT THE VALUE OF A DESCRIPTIVE THESIS OF THE VULNERABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW TO POWER, LIES IN ENABLING A MORE REALISTIC APPROACH, IN TERMS OF ETHICAL AGENCY AND POWER RELATIONS, TO THE MARGINS OF THE RULE OF LAW OR THE GREY ZONES.
241	THE EU IS IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING A NEW RULE OF LAW REGULATION WHICH PASSED PARLIAMENT IN JANUARY 2019. HOW IS THIS A USEFUL ADDITION TO THE EXISTING POLITICAL PROCEDURES UNDER THE TREATIES? ALSO, IN WHAT WAY WOULD A REVISED LITIGATION STRATEGY BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (CJEU) ADD ANYTHING TO THE ARSENAL OF REMEDIES THUS AVAILABLE? USING PRINCIPALLY THE EXAMPLE OF HUNGARY, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE NEWLY PROPOSED REGULATION IS A VALUABLE ADDITION, BUT THAT A SOMEWHAT REVISED LITIGATION STRATEGY CAN ALSO HELP DEFEND EU VALUES.
242	IN A 207-COUNTRY SAMPLE, WE FIND THAT RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION ARE BOTH ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTRY'S RELIGIOUS HERITAGE, THEREBY PARTIALLY EXPLAINING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH FOUND IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH. WE ALSO SHOW THAT OUR RESULTS CHANGE WHEN WE CONTROL FOR SOME VARIABLES LACKING DATA FOR ALL COUNTRIES IN THE SAMPLE BUT THAT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN SAMPLE COMPOSITION RATHER THAN THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTROL VARIABLES. OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RESEARCHERS DOING CROSS-COUNTRY ANALYSIS SHOULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE EFFECTS OF ADDING A CONTROL VARIABLE AND THE RESULTING SAMPLE COMPOSITION EFFECTS.
243	PURPOSE - OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, THE APPLICATION OF MOST-FAVOURED-NATION (MFN) CLAUSES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS (IIAS) TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MATTERS HAS GENERATED CONTROVERSY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THE CONTROVERSIES BY EXAMINING THE RULE OF LAW ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH APPLICATION OF MFN. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY DESCRIBES CONTROVERSIES REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF MFN TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AS PER THE EXTANT LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT. IT EXPLORES THE ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW IN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION. THE PAPER THEN ANALYSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF APPLYING MFN TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MATTERS FOR THE ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW. BASED ON SUCH ANALYSIS, THE STUDY ARGUES THAT THE APPLICATION OF MFN TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MATTERS UNDERMINES CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW. FINDINGS - THE PAPER HAS OUTLINED THE RELEVANT ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW IN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION AS ACCESS TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT; JUDICIAL (OR TRIBUNAL) INDEPENDENCE, FAIRNESS AND IMPARTIALITY; CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY OF LAW AND DECISIONS; TRANSPARENCY; ACCOUNTABILITY AND SUBJECTION OF DISPUTE FORUMS AND SYSTEMS TO LAW. IT FOUND THAT THE APPLICATION OF MFN UNDERMINES VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR OF CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY AND THE REQUIREMENT OF TRIBUNALS TO ADJUDICATE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY WILL HELP FUTURE INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS TO DECIDE ON THE APPLICATION OF MFN TO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MATTERS.
244	THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS A CONCEPT AT THE VERY HEART OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) MISSION DECLARED ITS SECRETARY-GENERAL, KOFI ANNAN. WHAT DOES THE CONCEPT MEAN INTERNATIONALLY? THE PAPER CONSIDERS ITS ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION; IN THE UN MORE GENERALLY; INTERMS OF THE ACCEPTANCES OF THE COMPULSORY JURISDICTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ); THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THICK AND THIN DEFINITIONS OF THE CONCEPT; EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW; THE REQUIREMENT OF CLARITY AND CERTAINTY BY REFERENCE TO INTERPRETATION OF TREATIES AND MARITIME DELIMITATION; COMPLIANCE BY GOVERNMENTS WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW; AND THE PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES; AND CONCLUDES WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL QUALITIES AND PROFESSIONAL QUALITIES.
245	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF MODERN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY ON DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN GENERAL. BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF SUCH IMPACT ARE CONSIDERED. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TOPIC IS DUE TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER DEEPENING OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND INSUFFICIENT RESEARCH FROM THE LEGAL POINT OF VIEW OF CURRENT THEORETICAL PROBLEMS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE DIGITAL ERA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO STUDY THE RULE OF LAW AS A PRINCIPLE OF THE MODERN STATE OF THE 21ST CENTURY AND TO STUDY THE PROBLEMS IN MATTERS OF HUMAN RIGHTS THAT HAVE ARISEN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. THE STUDY OF THIS ISSUE IS QUITE RELEVANT, CONSIDERING THE CONCLUSIONS, MADE AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK, CAN BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN FURTHER THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AIMED AT IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN RIGHTS JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND IMPROVING CURRENT LEGISLATION.
246	RULE OF LAW VIOLATION IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. YET THE AFRICAN UNION (AU), WHICH IS THE MAIN REGIONAL ORGANIZATION IN THE CONTINENT, IS NOT PLAYING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENSURING THE OBSERVANCE OF RULE OF LAW IN ITS MEMBER STATES COMPARED TO ITS COUNTERPARTS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT, BESIDE THE ISSUE OF LACK OF POLITICAL WILL, THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK OF THE AU HAS CONTRIBUTED ITS PART FOR THE NEGLIGIBLE RULE OF LAW MONITORING INVOLVEMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION AT THE MOMENT AND UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR URGENT REMEDY TO ADDRESS THESE LACUNAS. IN UNDERTAKING THIS INVESTIGATION, THE PAPER ADOPTS A COMPARATIVE APPROACH RELYING HEAVILY ON THE LESSONS FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH IS ASSUMED TO HAVE A BETTER MECHANISM IN THIS REGARD.
247	REGIONAL RULE OF LAW ITSELF CONTAINS DOUBLE VALUES OF STRENGTHENING THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING AND PROMOTING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN REALITY. ITS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK SHOULD BE MADE FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES OF THE REGIONAL DEFINITION, THE FUNCTIONAL OBJECTIVES AND CARDINAL CONTENT. IN LIGHT OF THE REALITY IN THE CURRENT CHINA, IT IS COMPARATIVELY MORE REASONABLE TO DEEPLY PROMOTE THE REGIONAL RULE OF LAW BY CONTINUING THE MODE OF GOVERNMENT-PROMOTION ROAD. OF COURSE THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE UNITY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND REGIONAL AUTONOMY, REGIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THE UNIFIED MARKET CONSTRUCTION, OFFICIAL LAW AND UNOFFICIAL LAW WILL APPEAR AND NEEDS COORDINATING.
248	CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION; IT HAS SOME COMMONALITIES WITH THE RULE OF LAW MODERNIZATION OF ALL COUNTRIES BUT IT IS MORE CHARACTERIZED BY FEATURES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE CHINESE CONTEXT. THE PROMINENT FEATURE THAT CONSTITUTES THE CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, CHINESE STYLE, AND CHINESE MODEL, IS THE ADHERENCE TO THE PATH OF SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS THIS FEATURE THAT DETERMINES THE DIFFERENCE WITH WESTERN RULE OF LAW MODERNIZATION. REPRESENTING A NEW FORM OF HUMAN RULE OF LAW CIVILIZATION, THE CHINESE-STYLE PRIMARILY FEATURES THE BUILDING OF A SOCIALIST LAW-BASED COUNTRY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY, INCLUDING CENTRALIZED, UNIFIED, AUTHORITATIVE, AND EFFICIENT CHINESE-STYLE NATIONAL SUPERVISION, AS WELL AS THE DUAL EXISTENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) AND BY THE STATE. CHINESE MODERNIZATION CANNOT BE MADE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW BEING MODERNIZED AND SERVING AS A SAFEGUARD. COMPREHENSIVE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS AN OVERRIDING APPROACH, AND TWO METHODS HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED SPECIFICALLY: FIRSTLY, CONSTRUCTION OF A MODERN SOCIALIST COUNTRY IN ALL ASPECTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AND SECONDLY, PERFORMANCE OF ALL WORK OF THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
249	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE "RULE OF LAW" AS A SOCIOCULTURAL CONCEPT THAT HAS CONCRETE EFFECTS ON THE LIVES OF NEWLY ARRIVED CHINESE MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS IN POSTCOLONIAL HONG KONG. I INVESTIGATE A SEEMING PARADOX: HOW IN HONG KONG THE "RULE OF LAW"SEEN AS A KEY SYMBOL OF FREEDOM-ACTED AS A VEHICLE OF OPPRESSION, AND NOT JUST BELONGING, FOR RECENTLY ARRIVED IMMIGRANTS FROM MAINLAND CHINA. THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION OF HOW "LAW" SERVED AS A VEHICLE FOR IMMIGRANTS' BOTH BELONGING TO AND CONTESTATION OF THE STATE, I ALSO SHOW HOW IMMIGRANTS BEGAN TO QUESTION THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS BELIEVED TO BE INHERENT TO THE PRACTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG-AS THEY GRAPPLED WITH NOVEL UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE LAW AND NEW POSSIBILITIES OF EXERCISING RIGHTS-BASED CLAIMS.
250	DESPITE CALLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 'SECOND-GENERATION' APPROACHES, SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) PROCESSES IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED CONTEXTS REMAIN DOMINATED BY STATE-CENTRIC STRATEGIES WITH WEAK RECORDS OF IMPROVING SECURITY GOVERNANCE OR HUMAN SECURITY. SSR'S CURRENT IMPASSE, WE SUGGEST, IS BEST CAPTURED IN THE TENSION BETWEEN AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AND A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT SUSTAINABLE PEACE MUST BE GROUNDED IN LOCAL TRADITIONS AND PRACTICES. OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT RE-THINKING THE PLACE OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN SSR AS A LONG-TERM ASPIRATION, RATHER THAN A SHORT-TERM FIX, REQUIRES RECONSIDERING ACCOUNTABILITY IN SECURITY GOVERNANCE. IN CONTEXTS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAKLY INSTITUTIONALISED, AND WHERE MYRIAD FORMS OF SECURITY PROVISION CO-EXIST, HOW (AND BY WHOM) CAN SECURITY ACTORS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE? WE SEEK TO IDENTIFY VARIETIES OF EXTRA-LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXIST IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED CONTEXTS, AND WAYS IN WHICH EXTERNAL ACTORS MAY SUPPORT - WITHOUT COOPTING - SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.
251	UKRAINE'S RULE OF LAW COMPLIANCE REMAINS POOR HOWEVER THE EVALUATION SCALE IS DRAWN AND WHATEVER RESOURCES EXTERNAL DONORS COMMIT TO FOSTER THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DOMESTIC HINDRANCES TO THE INTRODUCTION AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE. IT ARGUES THAT SYSTEMIC SHORTCOMINGS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN UKRAINE ARE NOT ONLY AND NOT SO MUCH DUE TO DEFICIENCIES IN THE SUPPLY OF LAW, OR THE SHAPE OF LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS, AS THEY ARE DUE TO DEFICIENCIES IN THE ELITE AND POPULAR DEMAND FOR LAW, OR SOCIETAL ATTITUDES TO LAW AND ITS 'RULE'. THE FINDINGS REVEAL A LOW DEMAND FOR (THE RULE OF) LAW AMONG UKRAINIAN POLITICAL AND BUSINESS ELITES, LEGAL PROFESSIONALS AND THE WIDER POPULATION AND EXPOSE OBSTACLES TO MEANINGFUL LEGAL CHANGE AT THE LEVEL OF POWER STRUCTURES, PROFESSIONAL AND POPULAR SOCIAL NORMS. THE FINDINGS' IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND POLICY ARE ADDRESSED IN THE CONCLUSION.
252	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MAKE A REFERENTIAL APPROACH FROM A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE TO THE HISTORICAL TRAJECTORY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN COLOMBIA DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NOTION OF THE TERM, BALANCE WITH OTHER LATIN AMERICA STATES, ITS INSERTION IN THE 1991 POLITICAL CONSTITUTION OF COLOMBIA AND BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AS CONTENT INCLUDED IN THAT FIGURE. THE STUDY CONTEMPLATES DEFINITION OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, REFERRING TO ITS EVOLUTION, THE LEGAL MECHANISMS ON WHICH IT IS BASED IN DIVERSE LEGISLATION, PLUS ITS EXISTING LEGAL CONSECRATION IN THE COLOMBIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, DOCTRINAL, LEGAL AND CASE LAW FOUNDATIONS ARE EXPLAINED, GUIDING THIS WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING RESULTS. THE STUDY IS OF THE DOCUMENTARY-DESCRIPTIVE TYPE, CARRIED OUT UNDER THE QUALITATIVE PARADIGM THROUGH DIRECT OBSERVATION AND THE READING OF RELEVANT BENCHMARK TEXTS; ALSO, TO OBTAIN RESULTS, LEGAL DOGMATICS AND HERMENEUTICS ARE APPLIED AS METHODS BELONGING TO LEGAL RESEARCH ANALYSIS. ONCE THE NORMATIVE, DOCTRINAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL FRAMEWORK HAVE BEEN REVIEWED, RESEARCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT EVOLUTION OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW WAS ESTABLISHED IN ITS ESSENCE AND RECOMMEND THAT IT ADAPT, IN ORDINARY LEGISLATION, CLEARER PRECEPTS FOR PROTECTING THE ACTORS INVOLVED.
253	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE GROWTH OF CAPITALISM IN EAST ASIA. THE BASIC ARGUMENT IS THAT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN EAST ASIA ARE EMBEDDED IN THE SYSTEM OF STATE-DOMINATED CORPORATIST CAPITALISM OF EAST ASIA. THIS DISTINCTIVE FORM OF CAPITALISM HAS PRODUCED A SYSTEM OF LAW AND LEGALISM THAT NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ORTHODOX MODEL OF LIBERAL LEGALISM THAT UNDERPINS THE CONVENTIONAL WEBERIAN MODEL. THIS AUTHORITARIAN AND STATIST LEGALISM OF EAST ASIA IS CHARACTERIZED BY TWO MAIN FEATURES: FIRST, THE LEGAL SUBJECT IS CONSTITUTED IN TERMS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR INSTITUTION RATHER THAN THE LEGAL PERSON (NATURAL OR JURISTIC); AND SECOND, LAW IS USED AS A TECHNIQUE OF RULE TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY OBJECTIVES OR GOALS OF THE STATE. THEREFORE, EAST ASIAN LEGALISM IS CHARACTERIZED BY RULE THROUGH LAW RATHER THAN THE RULE OF LAW.
254	THE ARTICLE AIMS TO CONSIDER THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF SUCH A MULTIFACETED PHENOMENON AS EFFICIENCY IN STATE ACTIVITIES AND LEGAL SYSTEMS. IN MODERN RUSSIA, NOT ONLY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAWS, BUT ALSO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE ACTIVITIES IN IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW, GAINS IMPORTANCE. TO SOLVE THE TASKS POSED, THEY USED THE FOLLOWING METHODS: LOGICAL (DESCRIPTION, CLASSIFICATION), STRUCTURAL-SYSTEM, FORMAL-DOGMATIC AND COMPARATIVE. AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY, IT HAS BEEN REVEALED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LEGISLATION AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTIVITIES TO IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE SOCIAL COMPONENT, THAT IS, TO MEET PUBLIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RUSSIAN LEGISLATION IS RELATED NOT ONLY TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE OBJECTIVES SET BY THE LEGISLATOR, THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LEGISLATIVE OBJECTIVES AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED, BUT ALSO TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE LAWS WITH THE NEEDS OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC INTERESTS. EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ALSO HAS A PROMINENT SOCIAL COMPONENT. THE ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE FULL OF REAL SOCIAL CONTENT.
255	STARTING FROM A TELEOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT PRIVATE POWER IS A RULE OF LAW CONCERN AS MUCH AS PUBLIC POWER. ONE WAY OF APPLYING THE RULE OF LAW TO PRIVATE POWER WOULD BE TO LIMIT INSTANCES OF 'LAWLESSNESS' AND ARBITRARINESS THROUGH FORMAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, WE ARGUE THAT PRIVATE POWER IS, TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT, CONSTITUTED BY LAW IN THE FIRST PLACE - AND THAT ITS LAWFUL EXERCISE IS NO LESS PERNICIOUS THAN ITS UNLAWFUL EXERCISE. DRAWING ON THIS CONSTITUTIVE FUNCTION OF LAW, WE PROPOSE A NORMATIVE CORE OF THE RULE OF LAW GROUNDED ON THE MORAL EQUALITY OF INDIVIDUALS. ATTENTION TO INDIVIDUALS' NEEDS, CAPABILITIES, AND PUBLIC AUTONOMY POINTS TO REQUIREMENTS OF DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AS PART OF THE POWER-CONFERRING FUNCTION OF LAW. THROUGH A DISCUSSION OF CONTESTATIONS OF FOSSIL FUEL POLICY, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THE CRITICAL AND EMPOWERING POTENTIAL OF A RECONFIGURED RULE OF LAW.
256	AT THE FOURTH PLENARY SESSION OF THE 18TH CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC), THE DECISION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CPC ON SOME MAJOR ISSUES CONCERNING DEEPENING THE RULE OF LAW 2014 WAS PASSED AND DELINEATED THE DIRECTION FOR THE RESEARCH OF OUR NATION'S CONSTRUCTION OF A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. FOR YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES ADHERED TO CONDUCTING WORK ON THE LEGAL COURSE UNDER THE CPC'S LEADERSHIP, ACTIVELY PROMOTING ADMINISTRATION ACCORDING TO LAW, AND CONSTRUCTING A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, AND HAVE MADE ENORMOUS ACHIEVEMENTS. HOWEVER, THERE MANY DIFFICULTIES STILL CO-EXIST, ALONG WITH CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. BY ADOPTING THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL RESEARCH APPROACHES SUCH AS DATA ANALYSIS, NORMATIVE ANALYSIS, INTERVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS, QUESTIONNAIRES, COUNTER-MEASURE RESEARCH, AND CASE STUDIES, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES AND CONDUCTED SYSTEMATIC AND IN-DEPTH RESEARCH ON THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW FROM MACROSCOPIC, TO MICROSCOPIC ASPECTS. THIS ARTICLE OUTLINED THE BASIC CONTEXTS AND REALISTIC VISION FOR CHINA'S CONSTRUCTION OF A GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH CAN PROVIDE ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT OF CONSTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENT UNDER THE RULE OF LAW WITH A BASIS IN THEORETICAL REFERENCE.
257	THE RULE OF LAW RESEARCH AGENDA IS IN MANY WAYS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. THIS IS REFLECTED, INTER ALIA, IN THE FACT THAT NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO INVESTIGATE THE EMPIRICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUB-COMPONENTS OF THE RULE LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SET OUT TO MAKE SUCH AN APPRAISAL. WE TAKE OUR CUE FROM A RECENT ATTEMPT TO GET AT THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH A TYPOLOGY OF 'DEFECTIVE' SUBTYPES OF THE RULE OF LAW. INSOFAR AS THE UNDERLYING RADIAL LOGIC CHARACTERIZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUENT UNITS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT WOULD MEAN THAT COUNTRIES TEND TO BE SITUATED IN A RANGE OF SO-CALLED DIMINISHED SUBTYPES, I.E., COMBINATIONS DEFINED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALL ATTRIBUTES SAVE ONE. THE UPSHOT OF THIS IS THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY AGGREGATE THE SUB-COMPONENT SCORES INTO COMPOSITE INDICES. HOWEVER, OUR ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE SCORES ON DIFFERENT RULE OF LAW ATTRIBUTES ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED AND THAT - IF LESS FINE-GRAINED DISTINCTIONS ARE USED - CASES TEND TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY EITHER THE PRESENCE OF ALL ATTRIBUTES, BY MODERATE SCORES ON ALL ATTRIBUTES, OR BY SEVERE SHORTCOMINGS IN EVERY REGARD. THESE FINDINGS CAN BE TAKEN TO SUPPORT, FIRST, THAT THE VALUE OF CONSTRUCTING DIMINISHED SUBTYPES OF THE RULE OF LAW IS LIMITED, AND, SECOND, THAT THE CREATION OF COMPOSITE MEASURES BY AGGREGATING ACROSS THE RULE OF LAW SUBCOMPONENTS IS NOT HAMPERED BY MULTIDIMENSIONALITY. AT THE END OF THE ARTICLE, WE USE THE EXTANT LITERATURE ON DEMOCRATIZATION AND STATE FORMATION TO IDENTIFY SOME POTENTIAL REASONS FOR THE HIGH CO-VARIATION BETWEEN RULE OF LAW ATTRIBUTES.
258	AS AN ESSAY ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBILITIES OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A BASIC JURIDICAL FORM AND THE IDEA OF REVOLUTION AS PROFOUND SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE. TO DO THIS, IT INITIALLY DOES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW BY PRESENTING ITS LIMITS AND SHOWING HOW DIFFERENT FORMS OF OPPRESSION CAN HAPPEN EVEN UNDER THE CLOAK OF THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER, REALIZES AN ANALYSIS OF THE IDEA OF REVOLUTION AND THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA FROM TEXTS OF LENIN. IT MAINTAINS THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSURING THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-REVOLUTIONARY CONTEXTS TO ENSURE THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC FREEDOMS. IT ALSO MAINTAINS THAT THE SPIRIT AND REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS MUST GAUGE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE RULE OF LAW SO THAT IT DOES NOT BECOME MERE FORMAL MECHANISM OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THE RULE OF LAW MUST STRENGTHEN THE REVOLUTION AND THE REVOLUTION MUST STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW.
259	AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF INCREASING SOCIAL DIVERSIFICATION IN A MARKET ECONOMY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES CONFRONTING CHINA'S EXISTING POWER STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY. BOTH TO OVERCOME THE LEGITIMATION CRISIS OF RULING AND TO ACHIEVE A SOFT LANDING OF THE POLITICAL REFORM DEPEND ON RECONSTRUCTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH JUDICIAL REFORM AS THE BREAKTHROUGH POINT. FOR THIS VERY REASON, THE TOP-LEVEL DESIGN OF REGIME TRANSITION CAN FOLLOW A TWO-STEP STRATEGY OF BUILDING A RULE OF LAW COUNTRY FIRST, TO BE FOLLOWED BY RESTRUCTURING POWER, SO AS TO ACHIEVE DEMOCRACY VIA THE RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO PROPOSES A CONCEPTION TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE RULE OF LAW, EMPHASIZING THAT THE ALTERNATIVE THREE-REVIEW MECHANISM IS BOTH NECESSARY AND FEASIBLE, IN THAT A TOP-LEVEL DESIGN OF JUDICIAL REVIEW CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STRIVINGS FOR JUDICIAL FAIRNESS, AN IMPLEMENTATION OF BUDGET REVIEW AND ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL FOR FISCAL DEMOCRACY, AND THE SYNERGY OF HIGH-LEVEL AND GRASSROOTS POWERS FOR A VIRTUOUS CIRCLE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AUTHORITY AND DEMOCRATIC POLITY IN MUTUAL ENHANCEMENT. THERE ALSO COMES THE MOMENT FOR PLURAL EFFORTS TO BOTH DRIVE AND ACHIEVE THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON THE THREE-REVIEW MECHANISM.
260	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION FROM AN EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE AUTHOR POSITS THAT THE TWO ARE NOT MERELY INTERDEPENDENT, BUT THAT FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION IS FOUNDATIONAL FOR EMBEDDING THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE A STATE NEEDS TO FACILITATE FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION TO ENCOURAGE THE EXPLORATION OF VIRTUE TO INFORM CONSENSUS AROUND SOCIETY'S COMMON NORMS. THIS VIRTUE-BUILDING ROLE OF FREEDOM OF THOUGHT, CONSCIENCE, AND RELIGION GIVES THE HUMAN RIGHT ITS FOUNDATIONAL ROLE FOR CREATING THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED FOR EMBEDDING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONCLUSION IS DRAWN FROM MARTIN KRYGIER'S ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO EMBED THE RULE OF LAW AND A COMPARISON OF THE WORLDWIDE RULE OF LAW, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND HAPPINESS INDEXES. TO SUPPORT A UNIVERSAL APPROACH TO THE HUMAN RIGHT AND TO UNDERPIN THE IDENTIFIED ESSENTIALITY OF IT, THE AUTHOR PROPOSES A THEORETICAL APPROACH GROUNDED IN THE THEORY OF COMMON GRACE; ROWAN WILLIAMS'S OTHER-REGARDING COMMUNAL APPROACH TO RIGHTS; AND THE FRAMEWORK FOR PLURAL LIVING TOGETHER PROPOSED BY HERMAN DOOYEWEERD. THE AUTHOR POSITS THAT THIS APPROACH COULD BE ADAPTED WITH A PLURAL METANARRATIVE TO ACCOMMODATE DIALOGUE AROUND VIRTUE BUILDING AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITHIN SOCIETIES WITH VERY DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS.
261	SOCIAL SCIENTISTS CAN CHOOSE FROM AMONG MULTIPLE QUALITY OF GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WHICH USE DIFFERENT CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF GOVERNANCE AND ITS COMPONENTS, RELY ON DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES, AND EMPLOY DIFFERENT AGGREGATION AND SCALING TECHNIQUES. DESPITE ALL DIFFERENCES, THESE INDICATORS ARE COMMONLY FOUND TO BE STRONGLY CORRELATED, WHICH MAKES THE CHOICE OF INDICATOR FOR A GIVEN ANALYSIS SEEM INCONSEQUENTIAL. WE FOCUS ON RULE OF LAW INDICATORS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CORRELATIONS AMONG THEM ARE INDEED HIGH WHEN COMPARING ACROSS COUNTRIES OR USING POOLED COUNTRY-YEAR DATA SETS, BUT ARE SURPRISINGLY LOW - SOMETIMES EVEN NEGATIVE - WITHIN COUNTRIES. GIVEN THE INCREASED INTEREST OF RESEARCHERS IN LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES WITH COUNTRY TIME SERIES, LOW AGREEMENT BETWEEN COUNTRY TIME TRENDS IN THE RULE OF LAW IS CONCERNING. WE ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM WITH AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF RULE OF LAW ON POPULAR SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY, WHICH LEADS TO OPPOSITE CONCLUSIONS DEPENDING ON WHICH MEASURE OF RULE OF LAW IS USED.
262	THE AIMS OF THIS ARTICLE ARE TWOFOLD: (I) TO PROPOSE AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK, FOCUSING ON LAW-MAKING ACTS, FOR ACCOUNTING FOR WHETHER THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE FULFILLED; AND (II) TO PROPOSE TWO FURTHER MODELS WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK. ONE MODEL, WHICH I CALL 'RULEBOOK FORMALISM', PERTAINS TO PARLIAMENT'S LAW-MAKING ACTS; ANOTHER MODEL, WHICH I CALL 'RIGHTS FORMALISM', CONCERNS THE COURTS' LAW-MAKING ACTS. THIS DISTINCTION RESULTS FROM THE DIFFERENT MODALITY OF LAW, IE THE DIFFERENT NATURES OF LAW-MAKING ACTS. DRAWING ON SPEECH ACT THEORY, I GIVE A GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS AS THE SUCCESS CONDITIONS OF LAW-MAKING ACTS. THEN, APPLYING THIS FRAMEWORK, I DISCUSS THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PARLIAMENT'S LAW-MAKING ACTS AND THE COURTS' LAW-MAKING ACTS RESPECTIVELY.
263	THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN AXIOLOGICAL SYSTEM. THE EU AS A COMMUNITY OF VALUES TREATS THE RULE OF LAW AS A CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE, WHICH IS AN OBLIGATION FOR MEMBER STATES, WHICH SHOULD RESPECT IT IN AN ABSOLUTE WAY. THE TREATY AS WELL AS THE INTERPRETATION BY EU INSTITUTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU, REFERS TO THIS VALUE AND THE OBLIGATION TO IMPLEMENT IT CORRECTLY. THE RECENT POLISH EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE VITIATED BY GOVERNING POWERS. BUT THIS ATTITUDE HAS CAUSED A REACTION OF EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS PROTECTING THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS TREATED BY THEM AS A BASE FOR MUTUAL TRUST.
264	THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, MORE UBIQUITOUS GLOBALLY TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE, OWES A LASTING DEBT TO THE WORK OF VICTORIAN LEGAL THEORIST A. V. DICEY. BUT FOR ALL OF DICEY'S INFLUENCE, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE IMPERIAL ENTANGLEMENTS OF HIS THOUGHT, INCLUDING ON THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO BRING THE IMPERIAL DIMENSIONS OF DICEY'S THINKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW INTO VIEW. ON DICEY'S ACCOUNT, THE RULE OF LAW REPRESENTED A DISTINCTIVE ENGLISH CIVILISATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT, ONE THAT FURNISHED A LIBERAL JUSTIFICATION FOR BRITISH IMPERIALISM. AND YET DICEY WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IMPERIAL RULE AT TIMES REQUIRED ARBITRARINESS AND FORMAL INEQUALITY AT ODDS WITH THE RULE OF LAW. AT A MOMENT WHEN THE RULE OF LAW HAS ONCE MORE COME TO LICENSE ALL SORTS OF TRANSNATIONAL INTERVENTIONS BY GLOBALLY POWERFUL POLITICAL ACTORS, DICEY'S PREOCCUPATIONS AND AMBIVALENCES ARE IN MANY WAYS OUR OWN.
265	THIS ARTICLE REVOLVES AROUND THE SEARCH FOR STATUTORY RECOGNITION OF THE USE OF ALGORITHMICS (INCLUDING RULE-BASED SYSTEMS) TO MAKE DECISIONS. THUS, THE FOCUS IS ON WHETHER A POWER-CONFERRING RULE IS NECESSARY BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY MAY ISSUE A VALID AUTOMATED DECISION. BY CLAIMING THAT SUCH A POWER-CONFERRING RULE IS NOT ONLY DESIRABLE BUT ALSO A LEGAL REQUIREMENT, ONE CONTENDS THAT THE SHIFTING TO AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS SIMPLY A BY-PRODUCT OF REENGINEERING BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICE THROUGH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. THE ISSUE IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES THROUGHOUT EUROPE AND BEYOND IN WHICH THE LATTER IS PRECISELY THE CASE. MOREOVER, VALUES SUCH AS EFFICIENCY AND FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO FAST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD BE CONSIDERED SOUND JUSTIFICATORY ARGUMENTS TO PURPORT THAT AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR SHOULD NOT BE GOVERNED THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL ARSENAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO OFFER A FIRST CONCEPTUAL SKELETON TO SOW THE SEEDS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON A NORMATIVE CLAIM THAT AUTOMATED PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DECISION-MAKING SHOULD, NONETHELESS, BE IMPLEMENTED IN LIGHT OF THE RULE OF LAW. SECONDLY, IT OFFERS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO GOVERN SUCH A PRACTICE. THE BACKGROUND IDEA IS THAT FOCUSING ON THE LEGAL POWER TO MAKE AN AUTOMATED DECISION CONSTITUTES A NECESSARY STEP TO GUARANTEE THAT THE ETHICAL AND POLITICAL PRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD UNDERGIRD THE ADOPTION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY FORM OF ALGORITHMIC DECISION-MAKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR ARE APPROPRIATELY AND ADEQUATELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
266	THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT MEASURES BEYOND ECONOMIC INDICATORS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF HUMAN WELL-BEING. ONE OF THESE MEASURES MAY BE AN INDICATOR OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY: THE RULE OF LAW. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ANALYSE THE INFLUENCE THAT RULE OF LAW HAS ON THE SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING OF 128 COUNTRIES. USING DATA FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT AND THE GALLUP WORLD, RESULTS SHOWED THAT, INDEPENDENT OF THE ECONOMIC LEVEL OF THE COUNTRY, THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING VIA ENHANCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, GIVING SPECIAL PRIORITY TO FIRST-ORDER RIGHTS.
267	THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES EMPIRICALLY THE EFFECTS OF INSTITUTIONS ON NEW BUSINESS FORMATION IN THE ITALIAN PROVINCES OVER THE PERIOD 2004-12. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY POSITIVELY AFFECTS ENTRY RATES, AND ITS IMPACT IS STRONGER IN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES. AMONG DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS, RULE OF LAW TURNS OUT TO BE MORE IMPORTANT IN SOUTHERN LAGGING REGIONS, WHILE REGULATORY QUALITY SEEMS MORE RELEVANT IN THE DEVELOPED CENTRE-NORTH. IN TIMES OF CRISIS, INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY LOSES IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING ENTRIES, WHICH BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO THE PROPENSITY TO INNOVATE AND TO HUMAN CAPITAL AND INFRASTRUCTURAL ENDOWMENTS.
268	GUATEMALA'S POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY CORRUPTION SCANDALS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. IN LARGE PART, THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN CONSUMED BY EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMPUNITY FOR CORRUPTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. IN 2015 VOTERS ELECTED JIMMY MORALES TO THE PRESIDENCY ON AN ANTI-CORRUPTION PLATFORM, HOPEFUL FOR CHANGE FROM A POLITICAL OUTSIDER. THROUGHOUT 2016 SOME ADVANCES WERE ACHIEVED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, AND PROSECUTORS WON SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE CONVICTIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR. BUT ORGANIZED CRIMINAL NETWORKS CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN THE COUNTRY, POSING SERIOUS CHALLENGES TO THE RULE OF LAW, AND BOTH THE MORALES ADMINISTRATION AND THE NEW CONGRESS DISPLAYED SOME OF THE SAME SHORTCOMINGS AS PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS.
269	THE ARTICLE PROVIDES EVIDENCE ON HOW THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENTS-RULE OF LAW AND ELECTIONS-WOULD AFFECT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCES THE ECONOMIC GROWTH. IT EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES WHETHER DEMOCRACY AFFECTS THE ECONOMIC CONVERGENCE OF COUNTRIES THROUGH THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS: (I) ELECTORAL COMPONENT OF DEMOCRACY, AND (II) RULE OF LAW PARAMETERS. INVESTIGATIONS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ISLAMIC AND NON-ISLAMIC COUNTRIES. WE FIND THAT THE ELECTIONS PARAMETER HAS A FIRST-ORDER EFFECT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; SUCH A RELATIONSHIP IS NOT CONFIRMED FOR ISLAMIC COUNTRIES. RULE OF LAW ALSO INFLUENCES THIS RELATIONSHIP, BUT BRINGS LESS EFFICIENT IMPACT TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OUR RESULTS ARE OBTAINED USING A SAMPLE OF 167 COUNTRIES OVER THE 2010-2012 PERIOD.
270	THIS ESSAY ADVOCATES FOR ADOPTING A DISAGGREGATED APPROACH WHEN EVALUATING THE PROGRESS THAT NON-DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA ARE MAKING TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RULE OF LAW MAY DEVELOP IN SOME AREAS, THOUGH NOT IN OTHERS, ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY THE STRUCTURAL UNDERPINNINGS OF A LIMITED RULE-OF-LAW SYSTEM. THE ESSAY ADOPTS A PROCEDURAL DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS RULES-BASED GOVERNANCE AND ARGUES THAT THE REGULARIZED ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS IS THE KEY PRECONDITION FOR ITS EMERGENCE. THIS STUDY DEFINES REGULARIZED ENFORCEMENT AS CONSISTENT, TRANSPARENT, AND PROCEDURALLY FAIR ENFORCEMENT AND IDENTIFIES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH ENFORCEMENT MAY EMERGE. ALTHOUGH BUREAUCRACIES WITH CLEAR MANDATES CAN PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP WHEN COURTS OF LAW ARISE AS THE MAIN ENFORCERS OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE THEORETICAL ARGUMENT ABOUT THE ISSUE-SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW IN CHINA IS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH THREE CASE STUDIES. THE FIRST IS OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, WHERE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN MINIMAL. THE SECOND IS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHERE REGULARIZED ENFORCEMENT HAS UNEXPECTEDLY DEVELOPED, ESPECIALLY FOR PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS. THE THIRD AREA IS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, WHICH IS EXPLICITLY FOLLOWING THE MODEL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES BY ARGUING THAT AN ISSUE-SPECIFIC APPROACH ALLOWS US TO GRASP MORE FULLY THE VARIATION IN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND PROGRESS TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW THAT EXISTS ON THE GROUND IN CHINA.
271	IN MAY 2014 THE LEGAL SERVICE OF THE COUNCIL DELIVERED AN OPINION ON THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK, STATING THE COMMISSION'S NEW MECHANISM WAS UNLAWFUL. THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THIS OPINION, AND QUESTIONS WHETHER THE ANNUAL RULE OF LAW DIALOGUE ANNOUNCED BY THE COUNCIL IN DECEMBER 2014 IS A FEASIBLE RESPONSE. HUNGARY IS USED AS A CASE STUDY TO HIGHLIGHT THE TOTAL FAILURE OF THE COUNCIL TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER IN THE FACE OF THE GRAVE AND SYSTEMIC ABUSES OF HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THAT COUNTRY SINCE 2010; AND POLAND WHERE AN AUTOCRATIC REGIME HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE AUTUMN OF 2015 IS ALSO MENTIONED. THIS IS CONTRASTED WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO TACKLE THE ACUTE CHALLENGE AND WITH THE COMMISSION'S ACTION ON SPECIFIC BREACHES. A CO-ORDINATED STRATEGY IS SORELY NEEDED.
272	THE CONCEPT "RULE OF LAW" IS USED WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, THE MEANING OF THE CONCEPT VARIES, DEPENDING ON SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW THE CONCEPT IS UNDERSTOOD IN THE SWEDISH AND CHINESE LEGAL CONTEXTS, BY DEFINING ITS DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS. THE RESEARCH CONFIRMS THAT THE CONCEPT, WHICH ORIGINATES FROM THE WEST, IS USED AND PERCEIVED QUITE DIFFERENTLY IN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN FACT, THE USE OF DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY, LAW-STATE THINKING AND SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, CONFIRM THE DIFFERENCES IN UNDERSTANDING.
273	PURPOSE RULE OF LAW IS ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING CORRUPTION IN A COUNTRY. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CORRUPTION IN 41 OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION BY FOCUSING ON JUDICIAL EFFECTIVENESS, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY. THE MODERATING ROLE OF REGULATORY QUALITY WAS ALSO CONSIDERED IN THE ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE ASSOCIATION AMONG RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY USED POOLED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION AND GENERALIZED METHOD OF MOMENTS-DYNAMIC PANEL FOR THE ROBUSTNESS TEST ON DATA OF 41 ASIA-PACIFIC COUNTRIES SPANNING FROM 2013 TO 2021. FINDINGS PROPERTY RIGHTS AND GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY WERE FOUND TO BE NEGATIVELY SIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING CORRUPTION. IN CONTRAST, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND REGULATORY QUALITY HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH CORRUPTION. THE FINDINGS BRING TO LIGHT ASIA-PACIFIC COUNTRIES' NEED FOR MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE AUTHORITIES SHOULD WORK TOWARDS ENHANCING THE COUNTRIES' IMAGE AS CORRUPTION-FREE NATIONS BY CREATING A STABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND PRESERVING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY THROUGH STRENGTHENED RULE OF LAW. ORIGINALITY/VALUE PREVIOUS RESEARCH LOOKED AT THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS AND SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES, BUT LITTLE ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO ASIA-PACIFIC COUNTRIES IN EXAMINING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND CORRUPTION.
274	THIS PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH "WHAT TAKES PLACE IN THE RULE OF LAW," A QUESTION I CONSIDER HERE THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE PROCESS OF "BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW" IN POST-WAR LIBERIA. THIS INVOLVES AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF LAW, AND AS SUCH, A STUDY OF LAW'S IMAGINARY LIFE ON THE GROUND. MY ARGUMENT HERE IS THAT ALL "EMPIRICAL" RESEARCH ENGAGES THE IMAGINATION, REQUIRING THE SCHOLAR TO DEVELOP THEIR CAPACITY TO STUDY PHENOMENA THROUGH THE IMAGINARY RATHER THAN SEEK TO ELIMINATE IT FROM THEIR SCHOLARSHIP. I MAKE THIS ARGUMENT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEODOR ADORNO'S NEGATIVE-DIALECTICAL PHILOSOPHY, WHICH BEARS MOST POINTEDLY ON THIS PAPER THROUGH HIS CONCEPT OF "EXACT IMAGINATION" - A CONCEPT THAT IS ENLIVENED BY THE TENSION BETWEEN REASON AND IMAGINATION, IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM CRITICAL TO EACH OTHER AND THUS TO RESEARCH. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO SEE LAW THROUGH THE IMAGINARY BY SEEING HOW THE NATIONAL LAW OF LIBERIA TAKES FORM AS LAW THROUGH THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH IT DIVERGES FROM ITS CONCEPT. THIS IS ABOUT HOW THE UNGROUNDED SITUATION OF THE NATIONAL LAW OF LIBERIA - A SITUATION THAT RESULTS FROM ITS BEING SEA-BORNE TO BEGIN WITH - IS WHAT GROUNDS IT AS "THE LAW OF THE LAND," AND HOW THIS IS THE CONDITION OF ITS RULE.
275	THE 4TH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND ITS ATTENDANT TECHNOLOGIES HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MANY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON THE RULE OF LAW. A FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THAT IT REQUIRES AN EFFECTIVE SOVEREIGN TO ESTABLISH FORMAL LEGALITY. THE SOVEREIGNS UNDERTAKING THIS RESPONSIBILITY TODAY ARE STATES. HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL SPACES BY THEIR VERY NATURE CHALLENGE THE ABILITY OF STATES TO DO SO. DIGITAL SPACES PRESENT CHALLENGES TO TRADITIONAL TERRITORIAL NOTIONS O F JURISDICTION RESULTING IN THEIR TENDENCY TO BE "UNGOVERNED" UNGOVERNED DIGITAL SPACES, AS WITH THEIR PHYSICAL COUNTERPARTS, ARE SPACES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT OPERATE. MOREOVER, UNGOVERNED DIGITAL SPACES CAN ALSO IMPACT GOVERNANCE IN PHYSICAL SPACES. BUT NOT ALL STATES ARE EQUAL, AND EACH HAS UNIQUE SOCIAL CONTEXTS TO GRAPPLE WITH. THUS, IN CONSIDERING THE QUESTIONS AROUND TECHNOLOGY AND THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE IN CONTEXTS BETWEEN STATES. SUCH TOPICS ARE ALSO GENERALLY DISCUSSED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DEVELOPED AND INDUSTRIALIZED STATES, WHERE TECHNOLOGY IS MOST EXTENSIVELY DEVELOPED AND DEPLOYED. BUT THE IMPACT OF THE 4TH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IS NOT LIMITED TO THE DEVELOPED WORLD, AND COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING STATES CONSTANTLY ENGAGE WITH SUCH TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, EVEN IF SUCH TECHNOLOGY AND PLATFORMS ARE DEVELOPED ELSEWHERE. THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL SPACES ON THE RULE OF LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF DEVELOPING STATES, FOCUSING ON SOUTHEAST ASIA.
276	WE EXAMINE THE 'RESOURCE CURSE' USING NEW DATA ON HISTORIC RESOURCE STOCKS AND AN IMPROVED ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY. THE PAPER DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN RESOURCE ABUNDANCE (STOCKS) AND EXTRACTIVE INTENSITY (FLOWS), FOCUSING ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RESOURCES AND RULE OF LAW. PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE INFORMATION ON PAST RESOURCE STOCKS IS ESTIMATED. WE FIND THAT ECONOMICALLY LARGE INITIAL NATURAL RESOURCE STOCKS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSEQUENT LOWER LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW AND DO NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT GROWTH, WHILE RAW RESOURCE EXPORTS DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON RULE OF LAW WHEN STOCKS ARE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT DO AFFECT AVERAGE GROWTH RATES. SAMPLE SIZE IS MAXIMIZED THROUGH THE USE OF AN EMIS (EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION WITH IMPORTANCE SAMPLING) ALGORITHM TO REPLACE MISSING DATA, MINIMIZING THE BIAS AND INEFFICIENCY ASSOCIATED WITH LISTWISE DELETION, WHICH COMMONLY ELIMINATES HALF OR MORE OF THE AVAILABLE DATA IN THIS SETTING.
277	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT A STRATEGIC STATE IN BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF A MARKET-ECONOMY, WHILST MAINTAINING A CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO LONG-TERM POLICY GOALS. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES A KEY PILLAR OF A MARKET ECONOMY THAT WE BELIEVE IS CRUCIAL TO PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH; WE TERM THESE INSTITUTIONS MARKET-ENGAGING INSTITUTIONS. WE PROPOSE THAT MARKET-ENGAGING INSTITUTIONS MAY FORM A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED BY A DYNAMIC MARKET ECONOMY AND THE STABILITY DEMANDED BY THE RULE OF LAW. WE DEFINE MARKET-ENGAGING INSTITUTIONS AS THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT FACILITATE GREATER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION FOR MARGINALIZED GROUPS, MANAGE TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTIONS, AND SUPPORT HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION. EXAMPLES INCLUDE SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING COVERAGE, TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP, EDUCATION AND TRAINING SERVICES, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES. WE SUGGEST THAT MOBILIZING THESE INSTITUTIONS NECESSITATES CREDIBLE COMMITMENT. FURTHER, WE ARGUE THAT THROUGH ITS COMMITMENT TO THE NON-ARBITRARY ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL RULES THE RULE OF LAW IS AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR SIGNALLING THE STATE'S CREDIBLE COMMITMENT. HOWEVER, AT TIMES THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATE TO BE FLEXIBLE TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF MARKET ACTORS MAY CONFLICT WITH THE RULE OF LAW'S DEMAND FOR CONSTANCY AND STABILITY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DELICATE BALANCING ACT REQUIRED TO SUSTAIN A STRATEGIC, RESPONSIVE, AND CREDIBLE STATE IN AN ERA OF INSTITUTIONAL FLUX.
278	AT THE IDEOLOGICAL LEVEL, THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS IN THE UNITED STATES IS PROCLAIMED AS A POLITICAL, LEGAL AND MORAL AXIOM. IT HAS BECOME A GENERALLY ACCEPTED VIEW THAT THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPTION REFLECTS THE MEANING AND CONTENT OF THE US LEGAL SYSTEM, WHICH IS BASED ON THE ORIGINAL VALUES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE IDEOLOGICAL SOURCE OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPTION IN THE UNITED STATES WAS THE THEOLOGICAL DIRECTION OF NATURAL LAW THEORY. THE THEOLOGICAL DIRECTION, BASED IN THE UNITED STATES ON THE DOCTRINES OF CALVINISM, DEVELOPED AN ATTITUDE TO LAW AS A SUPERNATURAL ENTITY THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE STATE. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE INFLUENCE OF THESE IDEAS ON THE FORMATION OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW CONCEPTION IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CORRECT DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT INCLUDED ALL THE MEANINGS OF THE CONCEPT AND ITS EQUIVALENTS IN ALL LANGUAGES. THIS CREATES AN ANALOGY WITH LARGE-SCALE SACRED CONCEPTS, SUCH AS "GOD". IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE CONCEPT "RULE OF LAW" IS DEFINITELY SIMILAR IN THIS SENSE TO THE CONCEPT "GOD", WHICH IS ALSO INCLUSIVE IN ITS SPHERE, AND MEANS THE OBJECTIFIED SUPERNATURAL ENTITY THAT IS THE OBJECT OF WORSHIP AND THE SOURCE OF THE GOOD.
279	THE ESSENCE OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO PROMOTE A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. THE APPROACH TO CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW REFERS TO THE CHINESE APPROACH TO PROMOTING A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM. BY COMPREHENSIVELY REVIEWING THE HISTORY AND REALITY, THEORY AND PRACTICE, AND ACTUAL AND DESIRABLE ASPECTS OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, WE CAN SUMMARIZE THE CHINESE APPROACH TO PROMOTING A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH CONTAINS VARIOUS ELEMENTS, INCLUDING A LEADERSHIP SYSTEM FOR THE RULE OF LAW WITH CENTRALIZED AND UNIFIED LEADERSHIP BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA, A RULE OF LAW VIRTUE PRINCIPLE OF PUTTING THE PEOPLE FIRST, A FUNCTIONAL ORIENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW TOWARD NATIONAL GOVERNANCE, AND A HISTORICAL-LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT INHERITS FINE TRADITIONAL CHINESE LEGAL CULTURE. THESE KEY ELEMENTS PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE AND CAN EFFECTIVELY SHOWCASE THE CHINESE APPROACH TO PROMOTING A MODERN LEGAL SYSTEM. DESCRIBING SUCH A CHINESE APPROACH NOT ONLY HELPS TO SUMMARIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIENCE OF CHINESE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO SHOWCASES THE CHINESE LOGIC AND CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS IN THIS MODERNIZATION PROCESS.
280	BACKGROUND: COUNTRIES OF WESTERN POLITICAL AND LEGAL TRADITION AND FORMER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE NEED FURTHER ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW BOTH LOGICALLY AND TAXONOMICALLY: IDEA (IDEAL) - PREREQUISITE (GUARANTEE) - ACHIEVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEY ALSO REQUIRE PRACTICAL APPLICATION, WHICH REFLECTS THE PRIORITIES OF NATIONAL INTERESTS BASED ON FREEDOM AND RESPECT TO HUMAN DIGNITY. THE ARTICLE CONTEXTUALISES ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION AS AN APPLIED INSTRUMENTAL CONCEPT, ESSENTIAL FOR BRINGING THE RULE OF LAW TO THE STATE, WHICH ALLOWS THE PREVENTION OF UNDUE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES' INTERVENTION IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR DISCRETIONARY POWERS IN PARTICULAR SPHERES OF HUMAN LIFE. IT ALSO SEEKS THE MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO ITS USE IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO ASSESS AND SUMMARISE REAL DAILY PRACTICES OF THE RULE OF LAW EXISTING IN MANY MODERN SOCIETIES AND STATES. FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION OF ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION AS A MEANS OF LEGAL REASONING TO ACCESS CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE IS SUBSTANTIATED. CONCENTRATION ON THE ENHANCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CURRENT UKRAINIAN MECHANISM TO PROVIDE THE MONITORING OF POWER USE BY THE STATE AND HUMAN IMMUNITY FROM ARBITRARY ACTIONS OF THE STATE AUTHORITIES IS GAINING A REAL PRACTICAL VALUE. IT IS EXTREMELY RELEVANT UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF COURT CONTROL OVER THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE STATE INTERVENTION IN SOCIAL AND OTHER TYPES OF HUMAN RIGHTS.METHODS: RESEARCH ON ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL POLITICAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT IS BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW DERIVED FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE DIALECTIC CORRELATION OF NATURAL LAW AND THE POSITIVIST LEGAL APPROACH. THE POTENTIAL OF THE LATTER APPROACH FOR THE PROVISION OF SUFFICIENT RESTRICTION OF THE POWER IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. HISTORIC, HERMENEUTIC, SYSTEMIC, STRUCTURAL, AXIOLOGICAL, AND INSTRUMENTAL APPROACHES PROMOTE ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION AS A PARTICULAR SPECIFIC IDEA (IDEAL), WHICH CONSOLIDATE THE ADVANCE OF SOCIAL AND LEGAL THOUGHT AS WELL AS THE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY FUNCTIONING. THEY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SUPERPOSITION OVER STATE ARBITRARINESS AS A PERMANENTLY ACTIVE AND CLEAR REQUIREMENT, INSTRUCTION AND CONCEPTUAL COMPONENT, PRINCIPAL RULE (SUB-RULE), AND COMMONLY SHAPED STANDARD, AS WELL AS ONE OF NON-DISPUTABLE PREREQUISITES AND GUARANTEES OF A COUNTER TO MALPRACTICE OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS. IN THIS ARTICLE THE THEORETICAL AND COMPARATIVE GENERALISATION OF THE TRADITIONS OF THE PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW PROVES AND CONFIRMS, ON THE GROUND OF THERELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS, AND SPECIFIC COURT DECISIONS RESULTED IN QUITE CLEAR REASONING IN FAVOUR OF THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN THE REAL LEGAL ORDER AND PROVIDED A PERSON THE POSSIBILITY OF EXERCISING THEIR GUARANTEED RIGHT TO APPEAL TO THE COURT AGAINST THE ACTIONS OF THE STATE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THE CONTENT AND MEANING OF ARBITRARINESS PREVENTION ARE PRESENTED. THEY REFLECT THE VALUE-NORMATIVE POTENTIAL OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTIRE SET OF NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL STRUCTURES, CURRENT LEGISLATION, MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES FOR ITS OBJECTIVE EVALUATION. THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE REGARDING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MECHANISM OF ENSURING CONTROL OVER THE USE OF POWER BY THE STATE AND PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM ARBITRARY ACTIONS OF AUTHORITIES AS WELL AS ITS SUBORDINATION TO ACHIEVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE EXAMINED IN THE GIVEN ARTICLE.
281	UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEXITY OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS IN HOST COUNTRIES AND ADAPTING STRATEGIES ACCORDINGLY IS CRUCIAL FOR INTERNATIONAL RETAILERS, GIVEN THE HIGH FAILURE RATE OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS (I.E., LEGAL ENVIRONMENTS) AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS (I.E., CULTURAL VALUES) ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERNATIONAL RETAILERS. WE ANALYZED THE DATA ON 144 INTERNATIONAL RETAILERS AND 565 SUBSIDIARIES OWNED BY THESE RETAILERS, USING THREE MEASURES OF RETAILER PERFORMANCE: SALES PER SQUARE METER, RETURN ON EQUITY, AND TOBIN'S Q. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT RETAILER PERFORMANCE IS INFLUENCED BY THE INTERACTIONS OF THE HOST COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW AND THREE CULTURAL DIMENSIONS. SPECIFICALLY, STRONG RULE OF LAW ENHANCES THE PERFORMANCE OF INTERNATIONAL RETAILERS IN HOST COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY WITH HIGH POWER DISTANCE OR HIGH UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE. IN HIGHLY COLLECTIVISTIC COUNTRIES, RETAILERS CAN ALSO BUILD STRONG RELATIONSHIPS TO GOVERN TRANSACTIONS. RESULTS PROVIDE KEY INSIGHTS THAT EXPLAIN INTERNATIONAL RETAILERS' PERFORMANCE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND DELIVER GUIDELINES FOR RETAILER STRATEGIES. & COPY; 2023 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY.

282	FOR MANY YEARS RESEARCH ON DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON COMPLEX ECONOMIC MODELS. HOWEVER, THE UNDERDEVELOPMENT PHENOMENON ENTAILS IMPORTANT CULTURAL ASPECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN BARELY EXPLORED. ONE OF THOSE ASPECTS IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL CULTURE AND THE RULE OF LAW, AND ITS EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENT. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO FIND EVIDENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE LACK OF THE BINOMIAL RULE OF LAW/LEGAL CULTURE AND UNDERDEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE STATES THAT LEGAL CULTURE AND RULE OF LAW, AS FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT, ARE A BINOMIAL, MEANING THAT, IN THE RESEARCH OF DEVELOPMENT/UNDERDEVELOPMENT PHENOMENON, THOSE FACTORS ARE TO BE STUDIED TOGETHER. RULE OF LAW, IN TERMS OF ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH DEVELOPMENT, SHOULD NOT BE CONCEIVED AS A MERE FORMAL EXPRESSION OF GENERALIZED SUBMISSION TO LAWS, INCLUDING ON THE PART OF THE ORGANS OF THE STATE ITSELF, BUT IT SHOULD ALSO BE OBSERVED FROM A BROADER PERSPECTIVE. HENCE ITS NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH THE LEGAL CULTURE, AS THE EXISTENCE OF THESE LAWS AND THE ACTUAL FACT THAT PEOPLE, GENERALLY, BE CONSCIOUS OF THEM AND THEIR CONDUCT BE GUIDED BY THEM. THE EXISTENCE OF THE BINOMIAL RULE OF LAW/LEGAL CULTURE CONSTITUTES, IN THIS WAY, A FRAMEWORK FOR THE FLOURISHING OF DEVELOPMENT IN A GIVEN REGION OR COUNTRY.
283	IN THIS ARTICLE I ANALYZE THE "RULE OF LAW" POLICY, WHICH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) ADOPTED AS A PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT AT THE 15TH PARTY CONGRESS IN 1997. I INVESTIGATE THE EMERGENCE OF RULE OF LAW POLICY AND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CCP INTRODUCED IT, THEN EXAMINE THE CONCRETE MEASURES AND ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY. I ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW POLICY IS THE CCP'S ATTEMPT TO INSTITUTIONALIZE ITS LEGAL AND PERFORMANCE LEGITIMACY. THE POLICY COMPRISES SEVERAL PARTS, INCLUDING INTRAPARTY REGULATIONS, COMPREHENSIVE LAW EDUCATION FOR LEADING CADRES, AND THE READJUSTMENT OF PARTY-LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS. HOWEVER, THE POLICY HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS ACHIEVED LIMITED RESULTS.
284	THIS ARTICLE WILL EXPLORE THE DILEMMAS THAT ALBANIA HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING IN IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW DURING THE PAST TWO DECADES WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES, INCLUDING THE DIFFICULTIES OF ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND THE PERVASIVENESS OF CORRUPTION. THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE THE LENS THROUGH WHICH THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS WILL BE EXAMINED. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE LEGISLATURE AND MORE BROADLY IN THE POLITICAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, AND THE DIVISIVE AND LEADER-DOMINATED POLITICAL PARTY SYSTEM ARE TWO ADDITIONAL OBSTACLES THAT ALBANIA IS FACING IN CONSOLIDATING DEMOCRACY. SINCE ITS FIRST POST-COMMUNIST ELECTION IN 1991, ALBANIA HAS EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES IN CONDUCTING LEGITIMATE ELECTIONS THAT MEET INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. THE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THESE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS OPERATE AND FROM WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED WILL PROVIDE THE BACKDROP FOR ANALYSIS.
285	AFTER THE END OF THE EAST-WEST IDEOLOGICAL SCHISM, IT WAS UNIVERSALLY ESTABLISHED THAT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS COULD NOT BE REALIZED WITHOUT TWO CONDITIONS: DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS WAY, NEW VALUES AND LIMITATIONS WERE ADDED TO THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATE, WHICH LIMITED THE TRADITIONAL DISCRETIONARY POWER OF STATES TO ORGANIZE THEIR POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM. THREATS TO PEACE DO NOT STEM FROM INTERSTATE AGGRESSION, BUT FROM THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW WITHIN STATES. THAT HAS LED TO COUNTLESS ACTIONS BY THE UNITED NATIONS, WHOSE PACIFICATION WORK, IT MAY BE DEDUCED, CONSISTS OF THE DEMOCRATIZATION AND INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING OF STATES. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF STATES MAINTAINS A TENDENCY THAT IS OBVIOUS FROM ITS LEGAL AND POLITICAL PRACTICE: TO PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS. MANY STATES ARE FAR FROM HAVING ACHIEVED THAT IDEAL, BUT THE TENDENCY IS ALREADY ONE OF PROGRESS, ALWAYS A SOURCE OF HOPE IN THE FACE OF THE FRUSTRATING DISAPPOINTMENT ENGENDERED BY THOSE DEMOCRACIES WHERE, AFTER DIFFICULT PERIODS OF TRANSITION, CORRUPTION AND PARTITOCRACY JOINED FORCES TO DISMANTLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, ENDANGERING, ALONG WITH NATIONALIST TRIBALISM, THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE STATE.
286	THIS PAPER'S MAIN PURPOSE IS TO APPROACH THE OPERATION OF DEMOCRACY IN URUGUAY AT THE EARLY XXI CENTURY, SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING IN THE FEATURES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS WORK IS CONFORMED BY THREE PARTS AND AN EPILOGUE. IN THE FIRST PART, WE BRIEFLY EXPOSE HOW THE FRENTE AMPLIO GOT TO TAKE THE POWER AND HOW IT GOVERNS IN URUGUAY. IN THE SECOND PART, SOME OF THE SUSTANTIVE ASPECTS OF THE CONTEMPORARY DEBATE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY ARE MENTIONED. IN THE THIRD PART, THE FEATURES OF DEMOCRACY IN URUGUAY ARE DEPICTED, EMPHASIZING IN THE OPERATION OF RULE OF LAW. THE EPILOGUE, AS A CONCLUSION, IS CONFORMED BY SOME REFLECTIONS ABOUT RULE OF LAW, APPLIED TO THE STUDIED CASE.
287	THIS ARTICLE ASKS HOW RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS FAILED TO 'BELL THE CAT' ON THE ILLEGALITY OF CENTRELINK'S ROBO-DEBT PROGRAMME AND ITS UNETHICAL CHARACTER. IT IDENTIFIES SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE DESIGN OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND REMEDIAL AVENUES AT SEVEN DIFFERENT LEVELS. IT ARGUES FOR ADHERENCE TO ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COUNCIL GUIDELINES ON MACHINE LEARNING, PARLIAMENTARY ACCOUNTING OF OMBUDSMAN AND AUDIT AGENCIES ON RULE OF LAW FOUNDATIONS AND MODEL LITIGANT PROTOCOLS, ATTENTION TO ETHICAL ADMINISTRATION, REDACTED PUBLICATION OF SELECTED FIRST TIER ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL RULINGS, CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE IN LEGAL AID/ADVOCACY FUNDING, BUILDING OF PRO BONO ADVOCACY PARTNERSHIPS, AND CULTURAL CHANGE DESIGNED TO COUNTER STIGMATISATION OF THE VULNERABLE.
288	SINCE THE RULE OF LAW WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE EU ENLARGEMENT POLICY, ITS ROLE WITHIN THE CONDITIONALITY POLICY HAS ADVANCED GRADUALLY SO THAT IT HAS BECOME THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ACCESSION PROCESS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN THE PROCESS OF EU ENLARGEMENT WITH A FOCUS ON THE WESTERN BALKANS AND STRIVES TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE MAIN CHALLENGES ARE IN THIS REGARD AND THE MAIN REASONS WHY THE EU HAS MADE THE RULE OF LAW CENTRAL TO ITS NEW ENLARGEMENT METHODOLOGY. DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EUROPEANISATION PROCESS OF THE CEE COUNTRIES, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN TERMS OF THE PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE COPENHAGEN POLITICAL ACCESSION CRITERIA. IT FINDS THAT WITH REGARD TO THE ACCESSION PROCESS OF THE WESTERN BALKANS, THE EU IS NO LONGER SATISFIED WITH 'REFORMS ON PAPER' AND STRIVES TO APPLY MORE ACTIVE LEVERAGE. HOWEVER, THE INTERNAL CHALLENGES FOR THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EU AND THE OFTEN 'NEGLECTED' FOURTH COPENHAGEN CRITERION - ABSORPTION CAPACITY OF THE UNION ITSELF REFERRING TO ITS CAPABILITY TO INCLUDE NEW MEMBERS - ALSO AFFECT THE PROCESS. RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED NOT ONLY BY MORE FOCUS ON THE BOX-TICKING BENCHMARK FULFILMENT EXERCISE THAN ON SUBSTANCE, BUT ALSO BY THE LACK OF CREDIBILITY ON THE SIDE OF THE EU THAT HAS UNDERMINED THE PRE-ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY. THE MOST ILLUSTRATIVE CASE IN THIS REGARD IS THE ACCESSION PROCESS OF NORTH MACEDONIA THAT IS ANALYSED AS A CASE STUDY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN CHALLENGES AND SHORTCOMINGS OF THE EU ENLARGEMENT POLICY. THE PAPER PROPOSES THAT THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AND THE OVERALL EUROPEANISATION PROCESS MUST REST ON A CREDIBLE MERIT-BASED ACCESSION PROCESS THAT INVOLVES CLEAR COMMITMENTS ON BOTH SIDES - CANDIDATE COUNTRIES BUT ALSO THE EU.
289	THIS FOCUS ON GIANLUIGI PALOMBELLA'S BOOK E POSSIBLE UNA LEGALIA GLOBALE? DRAWS ATTENTION ON MANY ISSUES CONNECTED TO THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW AS "AN INSTITUTIONAL IDEA CONCERNING LAW" IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. THE CONTRIBUTIONS GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE PROBLEMS AT STAKE: THE HISTORICAL ROOTS OF RULE OF LAW, THE UNITY AND DUALITY OF LAW AND POLITICS IN WESTERN TRADITION AND THE URGENCY OF RE-COUPLING IN SUPRANATIONAL AREAS, THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC THROUGH LAW IN THE AGE OF GLOBAL COORDINATIVE REGIMES. IN THE LAST CONTRIBUTION, THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK RETURNS ON SOME PROBLEMS RAISED IN THE COMMENTS.
290	THE IDEAL OF RULE OF LAW (ROL) IS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LON FULLER. HE AFFIRMS THAT A LEGAL SYSTEM HAS ITS OWN MORALITY INDEPENDENT OF OBJECTIVE MORALITY IF IT LIVES UP TO HIS EIGHT PRINCIPLES. EVEN THOUGH FULLER'S CONCEPTION GENERALLY IS RELATED TO PROCEDURAL NATURAL LAW OR ROL, JEREMY WALDRON ASSERTS THAT WHEN FULLER'S PRINCIPLES ARE SEEN IN COLD LIGHT IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ONE COULD APPRAISE HIS CONCEPTION AS PROCEDURAL. MANY OF THOSE PRINCIPLES PERTAIN TO THE FORMAL CRITERIA ADDRESSED TO LAWMAKING AUTHORITIES TO ASSIST IN LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THEY PLACE EMPHASIS MORE ON THE FORM THE LAW MUST TAKE AT THE END OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAN ON THE PROCESS ITSELF. BASED ON THAT CRITICISM, WALDRON CONTENDS, DEVELOPING A NOVEL PROCEDURAL CONCEPTION OF ROL, THAT IT IS BETTER TO CONSIDER FULLER'S PRINCIPLES AS FORMAL, THAN TO CALL THEM PROCEDURAL. IN GENERAL, THE DISCUSSION ON THE ROL REVOLVES AROUND THE TENSION BETWEEN FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDINGS. WHEREAS LEGAL POSITIVISTS OFTEN DEFEND THE FORMER, PROPONENTS OF NATURAL LAW SUPPORT THE LATTER. THIS STUDY ASPIRES TO EXPLAIN WALDRON'S PROCEDURAL CONCEPTION OF ROL, WHICH GOES BEYOND THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS. IN DOING SO, IT SHOWS HOW PROCEDURAL CONCEPTION DIFFERS FROM OTHERS IN ANALYZING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS AND BY EMPHASIZING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR DISTINCTIVE UNDERSTANDINGS OF LEGAL SUBJECTS. IN SHORT, IT WILL SHOW HOW A RATIONAL AND SELF-DIRECTED LEGAL SUBJECT LEFT ITS PLACE TO A SUBJECT CAPABLE OF PUTTING FORWARD ARGUMENTS, DISCUSSING AND DEVELOPING THE MEANING OF LAW, SAY, BEFORE THE COURTS.. IT WILL DISCUSS WHAT LAW IS BEFORE THE COURTS. FINALLY, THIS STUDY ASPIRES TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE FORMAL CONCEPTION OF ROL AND ITS CRISIS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING ACROSS THE GLOBE.
291	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE WHICH MEMBER STATE-LED INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS CAN PLAY IN OVERCOMING THE EU'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS, AND HYPOTHESIZES THAT IT CAN PROVE HELPFUL IN BREAKING THE CURRENT IMPASSE. IT BEGINS BY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE EU'S "TRADITIONAL" RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS-SUCH AS ARTICLE 7 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION (TEU) AND THE RECENT RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY REGULATION-HAVE FAILED (SECTION 2), BEFORE EXPLORING HOW INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS OPERATE, WHAT THEIR SHORTCOMINGS ARE, AND WHY SCHEPPELE'S PROPOSED "SYSTEMIC INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS" ARE IMPORTANT (SECTION 3). IT THEN SEEKS TO APPLY SAID FINDINGS TO THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS, USING TWO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AS AN EXAMPLE: THE ORAL PROCEEDINGS OF COMMISSION V. POLAND (REGIME DISCIPLINAIRE DES JUGES) AND A RECENT VOTE BY THE DUTCH PARLIAMENT COMPELLING ITS GOVERNMENT TO TAKE POLAND BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (CJEU) (SECTION 4). FINALLY, IT EXPLORES THE BROADER CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF RELYING ON ARTICLE 259 TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (TFEU) TO OVERCOME THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS: IT DISCUSSES KOCHENOV'S NOTION OF "BITING INTERGOVERNMENTALISM", WHAT ARTICLE 259 ILLUSTRATES ABOUT THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) HYBRID CONSTITUTION, AND HOW INTERGOVERNMENTAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS CAN FACILITATE FURTHER EUROPEAN INTEGRATION (SECTION 5). IT CONCLUDES BY RESTATING AND SUMMING UP ARTICLE'S HYPOTHESIS.
292	IN JULY 2005, TWO YEARS AFTER THE US-LED INVASION OF IRAQ, THE EUROPEAN UNION LAUNCHED EUJUST LEX (THE EU INTEGRATED RULE OF LAW MISSION FOR IRAQ), TASKED TO ADDRESS THE URGENT NEEDS OF THE IRAQI CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING TRAINING FOR HIGH AND MID-LEVEL OFFICIALS IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THIS MISSION IS AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF COLLECTIVE ACTION WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF SECURITY GOVERNANCE OR THE PROJECTION OF EU RULE OF LAW STANDARDS BEYOND EU BORDERS AS A GUARANTOR FOR STABILITY. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF OPERATION, EUJUST LEX HAS TRAINED MORE THAN 4,800 IRAQI SENIOR LEVEL CRIMINAL JUSTICE OFFICIALS IN DIFFERENT EU MEMBER STATES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX RULE OF LAW ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE MISSION OPERATES, THE ARTICLE DELIVERS AN EXTENSIVE OVERVIEW OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SET UP AND FUNCTIONING OF THE IRAQI CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE RULE OF LAW SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY, AS WELL AS THE MULTIPLE RELATED CHALLENGES IRAQ FACES. RULE OF LAW REFORM IS A CHALLENGING, COMPLEX LONG-TERM UNDERTAKING. THEREFORE, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE SEVEN YEAR CONTRIBUTION OF EUJUST LEX ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW SECTOR IN THE COUNTRY. MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE RAISES SOME QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE FOLLOW-UP OF COMMON SECURITY AND DEFENCE POLICY MISSION ACTIVITIES AND THE EVALUATION OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.
293	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF NATIONAL CLIMATE LITIGATION FOR WHAT IS TERMED 'THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW'. STARTING FROM THE FINDING THAT THE CURRENT INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE TREATY REGIME LACKS SEVERAL ELEMENTS OF AN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS LEGAL BINDINGNESS, CLARITY, AND JUSTICIABILITY, THE AUTHOR EXPLORES WHAT NATIONAL COURTS CONTRIBUTE TO FILLING THESE GAPS. DEVIATING FROM A LINEAR PROGRESSION NARRATIVE, WHICH IS PREVALENT IN EXISTING LITERATURE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A MORE NUANCED AND COMPLEX PICTURE. WHEREAS SUCCESSFUL CLIMATE LITIGATION IS HARDLY IMAGINABLE WITHOUT RELIANCE ON INTERNATIONALLY AGREED-UPON FACTS - SUCH AS REPORTS BY THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE LEVELS DEEMED 'DANGEROUS' - DOCTRINALLY DECISIONS DO NOT REPRESENT A TURN TOWARD A STRICTER RULE OF INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE LAW. INSTEAD OF APPLYING AND PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOPING CLIMATE TREATIES, COURTS THUS FAR HAVE PRIMARILY USED THESE PROVISIONS ONLY TO DEVELOP NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. THE CREATED SYSTEM OF HIGHLY CONTEXTUAL NATIONAL RULE(S) OF CLIMATE LAW IS A FRAGMENTED ONE WHICH IS REGIONALLY LIMITED TO A FEW STATES PREDOMINANTLY LOCATED IN WESTERN EUROPE. CONSEQUENTLY, IT IS A FAR CRY FROM A TRULY GLOBAL RULE OF INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE LAW.
294	PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EMPHASIZE THAT EAST ASIA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA, DESPITE ENORMOUS ECONOMIC ADVANCES, HAVE A DEFICIT ON RULE OF LAW, ANALYSED AS EITHER JUDICIAL AUTONOMY AND LEGAL INTEGRITY (RULE OF LAW I) OR AS VOICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY (RULE OF LAW II). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - FIRST, A DISTINCTION IS MADE BETWEEN TWO KEY ASPECTS OF RULE OF LAW; SECOND, THESE TWO ASPECTS ARE MEASURED BY DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK GOVERNANCE PROJECT, RELATING THEM TO VARIOUS MEASURES ON SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. FINDINGS - IT IS NOT GENERALLY TRUE THAT DEVELOPMENT LEADS TO OR ENTAILS FREEDOM, AS SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE ASEAN +3 REGION DISPLAY LOW SCORES ON EITHER ONE OF THE DIMENSIONS OF RULE OF LAW OR BOTH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - IN BOTH RESEARCH AND IN PRACTICE, ONE NEEDS TO DEVOTE MORE EFFORT INTO UNDERSTANDING HOW RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MAY BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT STRONG RULE OF LAW, EITHER AS LEGAL INTEGRITY AND JUDICIAL AUTONOMY, OR AS VOICE AND POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE PROCESS OF GLOBALISATION, DEMANDS FOR MORE OF RULE OF LAW IN THIS REGION APPEAR JUSTIFIABLE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS PAPER PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS HIGHLY RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE COUNTRIES IN ASEAN +3.
295	ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT ARE TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE STRINGENCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. DUE TO THE REVERSIBLE CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE TWO VARIABLES, A REDUCED-FORM RELATIONSHIP IS LIKELY TO OVERSIMPLIFY THEIR EFFECTS. THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A EQUATION SYSTEM TO ILLUMINATE THE INTERACTIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RULE OF LAW, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE STRINGENCY OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND TESTS THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE VARIABLES USING SENSITIVITY AND WEAK INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TESTS. NINE DETERMINANTS OF RULE-OF-LAW INCLUDING PRESENCE OF A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM, COUP D'ETATS, AND THE DEGREE OF SOCIAL FRACTIONALIZATION, ARE EXAMINED. WE FIND THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEIR INTERACTIONS HAVE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS ON A STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. WE FURTHER FIND POLITICAL COUPS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE NON-PARAMETRIC SIMULATION INDICATES THAT LONG-RUN EFFECT OF RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS LIKELY CONSIDERABLY STRONGER THAN ITS DIRECT EFFECT.
296	THE RULE OF LAW BELONGS TO THE VALUES THE EU PROCLAIMS IT IS FOUNDED UPON. LEAVING ASIDE THE LEGAL-HISTORICAL INACCURACY OF THIS STATEMENT, IT IS INDISPUTABLE THAT THE CONCEPT IS AT LEAST RHETORICALLY OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE TO BOTH THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES. AS SUCH, THE VERY OPEN ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ASSOCIATED CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES IN POLAND AND HUNGARY IN RECENT YEARS HAS UNDERMINED BOTH THE EU'S COHESION AS A COMMUNITY OF LIKE-MINDED MEMBERS AND ITS LEGAL SYSTEM WHICH IN MANY RESPECTS DEPENDS ON A SHARED COMMITMENT TO COMMON VALUES. THE PRESENT CONTRIBUTION REVIEWS FIVE RECENT PUBLICATIONS WHICH HAVE GRAPPLED WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EU AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE EXISTING AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE UNION IN ADDRESSING RULE OF LAW DEFICIENCIES IN ITS MEMBER STATES.
297	CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS ARE IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN CONTEMPORARY LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. THEY ARE NOT ONLY THE HEAD OF THE JUDICIARY BUT ARE ALSO QUITE IMPORTANT POLITICAL ACTORS. ALTHOUGH THEIR LEGITIMACY IS STILL CONTROVERSIAL IN POLITICAL THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY, THEIR MAJOR ROLE IN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IS BEYOND DISPUTE. NEVERTHELESS, IT STILL REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED WHETHER AND IN HOW FAR CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS CONTRIBUTE TO SUCCESSFUL PROCESSES OF DEMOCRATIZATION OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER TAKES A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS QUESTION BY DISCUSSING THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND ACTION ORIENTATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR A COURT TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER PROVIDES THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE FACT THAT CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS CAN INDEED CONTRIBUTE TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW-IF THE INSTITUTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COURTS AND IF THE COURTS SHOW A DEMOCRACY-FRIENDLY ORIENTATION. BY SHOWING THAT COURTS CAN BE CONDUCIVE TO A STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY UNDER SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS, THE PAPER SHEDS SOME LIGHT ON THE OVERARCHING QUESTION AS TO WHAT KIND OF INSTITUTIONS (AND ACTORS) ARE NEEDED TO HELP YOUNG DEMOCRACIES CONSOLIDATE.
298	THE PAPER PRESENTS THE FUNDAMENTAL AND HIGHEST IDEAL OF A FAIR SOCIETY - THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RULE. IT DEPICTS THE CONCEPT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AS A SYSTEM BASED ON THE IDEAS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM, DEFINING IT AS A LAW-ABIDING SYSTEM. THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO SEPARATE THE FORMAL FROM THE SUBSTANTIVE RULE OF LAW AND THEREIN THE RULE OF LAW IS REGARDED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE IN THE LEGAL SYSTEMS OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. THE CONCLUSION SHOWS THE VIEWPOINTS OF THE CROATIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONCRETE JUDGEMENTS.
299	THE POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY IS CRITICAL FOR ANY GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR ASSISTING IN RULING OVER THE CITIZEN BODY. NOTICEABLY, WHILE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE LITTLE TO NO CONCERN ABOUT THEIR 'RIGHT TO RULE', HOW IS 'RULE OF LAW' IN THE TECHNOETHICS OF CYBERNETICS DEFINED IN DEMOCRATIC REGIMES? AS WE ARE NOW IN THE CYBER ERA, THIS STUDY CONTENDS THAT VARIOUS DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES IN CYBERNETICS HAVE IN PRACTICE TRANSFORMED INTO TECHNIQUES OF TECHNOCRATIC TOTALITARIANISM THROUGHOUT PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS AND CORPORATIONS UNDER THE GUISE OF DEMOCRATISM. HENCE, THIS STUDY HYPOTHESISES THAT THE TECHNOETHICS OF CYBERNETICS, THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN LEGITIMACY VERSUS ILLEGITIMACY, AND JUDICIAL VERSUS UNJUDICIAL MATTERS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE INDISTINCT IN THEORY, WHICH NOTICEABLY SIGNIFIES MANY CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS.
300	THE LEGAL BASIS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT BOOM FOLLOWING THE CHANGE OF REGIME IN HUNGARY WAS THE REVIVAL OF THE FOUNDATION AS A LEGAL INSTITUTION AND THE ACT ON THE RIGHT OF ASSOCIATION OF 1989. ITS ECONOMIC BASE WAS PROVIDED BY THE TAX LAWS OF 1990, WHICH PROVIDED TAX EXEMPTION AND MADE FULL WRITE OFF OF THE DONATIONS TO THE FOUNDATIONS POSSIBLE. ALSO, THE CHANGES IN SOCIETY CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROCESS. THE CITIZENS GOT RID OF DICTATORSHIP AND WANTED TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE STATE FROM THE TERRITORIES WHERE ITS PRESENCE WAS NOT NECESSARY. THE CITIZENS WANTED TO CONTROL THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND WANTED TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE ISSUES RELATED TO THEM ON THEIR OWN. THEY ALSO WANTED TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CENTRAL POWER AND WANTED TO INFLUENCE ITS OPERATION. THIS CIVIL CLAIM KINDLED THE PROCESSES OF THE CHANGE OF REGIME, AND THIS HAS TO PREVAIL EVEN TODAY WHEN THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW ARE UNDER CONTROL. USING NIKLAS LUHMANN'S THEORY OF SOCIAL SUBSYSTEMS THE AUTHOR SEPARATES THE CIVIL SECTOR FROM THE OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE SOCIETY, CIVIL SOCIETY FROM THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR, THEN EXPLAINS WHY CIVIL SOCIETY HAS A DECISIVE ROLE IN THE CONTROL OF THE RULE OF LAW.
301	THE MAIN AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO SEEK THE POTENTIAL FOR TRADE LIBERALIZATION BETWEEN INTRA-BRICS AND THE IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW, SEARCHING FOR ISSUES THAT ARE HAMPERING OR WOULD HAMPER THE BRICS COLLABORATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. IF ANY POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS OR ORGANIZATION THAT IMPLEMENTS LOYALTY TO THE INTERESTS OF THE RULE OF LAW WOULD CONTRIBUTE TREMENDOUSLY TO THE PROGRESS OF REGIONAL OR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC GROWTH, LACK OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN SERIOUSLY HINDER THE IDEA OF TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND INTRA-REGIONAL OR INTRA-COMMUNITY TRADE. I AM ARGUING THAT EVEN IF TRADE BARRIERS ARE REMOVED FROM TRADE -COLLABORATION, AND IF THERE IS NO LOYALTY TO THE RULE OF LAW THERE WILL STILL BE BARRIERS THAT WILL HINDER TRADE LIBERALIZATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COUNTRY IS VERY CORRUPT THE CORRUPT OFFICIALS COULD DELAY GOODS ENTERING THE COUNTRY BY MAKING UNNECESSARY EXCUSES SO THAT BRIBE COULD BE GIVEN THEREBY CREATING UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNFAIR SITUATIONS AND THEREBY STIMULATING DIFFICULTIES FOR BUSINESSES NOT TO FLOW FREELY AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. THE IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE BRICS TREATY IS TO STIMULATE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES. I EXAMINE THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE BRICS COUNTRIES INTEGRATION TO ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRIES USING SUBSERVIENT VARIABLES GMM REGRESSION IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A GROWTH MODEL. I FOUND GREAT SUBSTANTIAL EMPIRICAL AFFIRMATION FOR A POSITIVE ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND GROWTH. THE RESULTS OF SOME VARIABLES SHOWED NEGATIVE IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE THAT EXIST ON MEMBERS OF THE BRICS COUNTRIES WHICH HINDERS PERFECT COOPERATION AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS BUT THERE WERE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION.
302	THE STUDY OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMES WITH AN INHERENT CONTRADICTION IN THAT WHILE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS RAPIDLY AND EMBRACES NOTIONS SUCH AS INTERNATIONALIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION, TRADITIONAL LAW, FOR THE MOST PART, CAN BE SLOW TO REACT TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND IS ALSO PREDOMINANTLY CONFINED TO NATIONAL BORDERS. HOWEVER, THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW DEFIES THE PHENOMENON OF LAW BEING BOUND TO NATIONAL BORDERS AND ENJOYS GLOBAL RECOGNITION. HOWEVER, A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS LOOMING IN THE FORM OF AN ASSAULT BY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI). AS LARGE STRIDES ARE MADE IN THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF AI, THIS TECHNOLOGY IS STARTING TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO DIGITAL DECISION-MAKING SYSTEMS AND IS IN EFFECT REPLACING HUMAN DECISION-MAKERS. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS DEVELOPMENT IS THE USE OF AI TO ASSIST JUDGES IN MAKING JUDICIAL DECISIONS. HOWEVER, IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A 'BLACK BOX' DUE MAINLY TO ITS COMPLEXITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS PROTECTED BY LAW. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND THE DIMINISHED ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE OPERATION OF THESE SYSTEMS INCREASINGLY BEING USED BY THE STRUCTURES OF GOVERNANCE IS CHALLENGING TRADITIONAL NOTIONS UNDERPINNING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SO IN RELATION TO CONCEPTS ESPECIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS TRANSPARENCY, FAIRNESS AND EXPLAINABILITY. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE TECHNOLOGY OF AI IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, HIGHLIGHTING THE RULE OF LAW AS A MECHANISM FOR HUMAN FLOURISHING. IT INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RULE OF LAW IS BEING DIMINISHED AS AI IS BECOMING ENTRENCHED WITHIN SOCIETY AND QUESTIONS THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT CAN SURVIVE IN THE TECHNOCRATIC SOCIETY.
303	THE ABILITY OF WORKERS GENERALLY TO ENFORCE THEIR LABOUR RIGHTS IN THE UK HAS BEEN A MATTER OF ONGOING DISCUSSION OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. HOWEVER, THE DOMINANCE OF THE TOPIC OF IMMIGRATION IN THE BREXIT DEBATES, ALONG WITH QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE NEED FOR, AND POSITION OF, EU MIGRANT WORKERS IN THE BRITISH LABOUR MARKET, HAS BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS THE ISSUES FACING THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN THEIR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THEIR EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. THIS, WE ARGUE, POSES A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW AS DEFINED BY BINGHAM. FOR HIM, ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THAT ACCESS TO COURTS IS THE 'OBVIOUS COROLLARY OF THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERYONE IS BOUND BY AND ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE LAW'. THIS LEADS TO OUR CONSIDERATION OF, FIRST, THE PERSPECTIVE OF FORMAL ENFORCEMENT (A 'THIN' CONCEPTION OF THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO THE COURTS) AND SECOND, EFFECTIVE SUBSTANTIVE ENFORCEMENT (A 'THICKER' CONCEPTION OF THE RIGHT). WE ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE REFORMS PROPOSED IN THE TAYLOR REVIEW WILL BE A THICKENED RIGHT OF ACCESS FOR ALL WORKERS, BUT A RELATIVELY THINNER RIGHT FOR EU MIGRANT WORKERS, IN WHICH THEIR PARTICULAR VULNERABILITIES AND OBSTACLES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED OR AMELIORATED. THE CHASM BETWEEN EU MIGRANT AND NON-MIGRANT WORKERS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST, REMAIN, IF NOT WIDEN FURTHER.
304	THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PRESENT THE RULE OF LAW UNIVERSALISM AS A RELEVANT THEORETICAL AND SOCIO-POLITICAL ISSUE THAT CRITICAL LEGAL THOUGHT NEEDS TO CONTEND WITH. IN ORDER TO DO SO, THIS ISSUE IS DESCRIBED THROUGH A MARXIST THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH AIDS IN IDENTIFYING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS UNIVERSALISM. FURTHERMORE, THE MARXIST THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IS SUGGESTED AS A COUNTERMEASURE THAT ALLOWS FOR GOING BEYOND IT. THE RULE OF LAW UNIVERSALISM IS ANALYSED AS A PROCESS CONNECTED TO ESTABLISHING HEGEMONY AND STATUS QUO THAT AFFECTS BOTH THE WAY THE LAW IS THOUGHT OF AND PRACTICED. THE POST-COMMUNIST CONTEXT SERVES IN FLESHING OUT SOME OF THESE CONSEQUENCES. ALTHOUGH THE TRANSITION IS NOT THE MAIN SUBJECT OF INQUIRY, IT IS A STARTING POINT TO A SET OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW UNIVERSALISM, MAINLY REGARDING HISTORICAL EMBEDDEDNESS AND SOCIO-POLITICAL DEPENDENCY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE TRANSITIONAL CONTEXT ILLUSTRATES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW TREATED AS A GENERALIZED BLUEPRINT AND THE REALITY IT IS INTRODUCED TO. THE METHOD OF APPROACH TO THIS TENSION ARGUED FOR IN THIS PAPER IS MARXIAN THEORIZATION OF CONCEPT AS AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT THAT UNDERLIES HISTORICAL MATERIALISM. THIS MOVEMENT WITHIN CONCEPT IS JUXTAPOSED TO THE UNIVERSALISM. THE PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE FOLLOWED BY FINDINGS FROM MARXIST LEGAL THEORY THAT PINPOINT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONCRETE INTERVENTIONS INTO THE LEGAL THEORY THAT ABATE ITS EVER-GROWING ABSTRACTNESS. IN PARTICULAR, THE IMPORT OF KNOWLEDGES AND PRACTICES DIVORCED FROM THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM IS BROUGHT INTO FOCUS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF ASSESSMENT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OVERTURNING THE RULE OF LAW UNIVERSALISM AND A DISCUSSION ON THE EMANCIPATORY POTENTIAL OF LAW.
305	FOR A LONG TIME, SCHOLARS VIEWED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VIRTUE AND LAW FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DICHOTOMY, OR VIEWED THE NATURE OF ANCIENT CHINESE "LAW IS PUNISHMENT." BASED ON THE PROPOSITION THAT VIRTUE AND LAW COMPLEMENT AND HARMONIZE WITH EACH OTHER BY PRE-QIN CONFUCIANS, CONTEMPORARY SCHOLARS PROPOSE THE INTEGRATION OF VIRTUE AND LAW AND THE CONCEPT OF "VIRTUOUS RULE OF LAW." FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT, LAW IS A GOVERNANCE TOOL ADAPTED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF SOCIETY AND THE NEED TO ENRICH THE COUNTRY AND STRENGTHEN THE ARMY. FROM THE LOGIC OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL THOUGHTS, LAW IS A PROPOSITION TO REALIZE "IMPARTIALITY" AND OPPOSE "PARTIALITY," WHICH HAS THE SPIRITUAL ESSENCE OF UNIVERSALITY, OBJECTIVITY, AND IMPARTIALITY. ACCORDING TO XUNZI, LAW IS A SYSTEM OF LOVE BASED ON JUSTICE AND PRINCIPLES; RITUAL RULES HAVE NOT ONLY THE FUNCTION OF SOCIAL NORMS, BUT ALSO THE FUNCTION OF MORAL EDUCATION. THE AIM OF LAW, ESTABLISHED, DELIBERATED, AND PRACTICED BY PERSONS OF CHARACTER, IS TO ACHIEVE A KINGLY VIRTUE-CENTERED SOCIETY FULL OF RITE, MUSIC, JUSTICE, ORDER, HARMONY, AND HAPPINESS. IN XUNZI'S POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, THE IDEA OF "VIRTUOUS RULE OF LAW" IS FINALLY REALIZED.
306	THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE CONCERN OF THE CHILEAN PHILOSOPHER JENARO ABASOLO FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE LEADS HIM TO PROPOSE A THEORY OF JUSTICE THAT ANTICIPATES THE FORM OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. FOR ITS POLITICAL PROPOSAL, MAINTAINING THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF LIBERALISM, CONNECTS IN A PARTICULAR WAY THE SOCIAL AIMS WITH THE POLITICIANS, UNTIL DEFENDING THE NECESSITY OF ESTABLISHING LAWS THAT REGULATE THE ECONOMIC SPHERE AND THE FREEDOM OF INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, ABASOLO'S CRITIQUE OF THE LIBERAL STATE FORMS A SERIES OF LIBERAL PUBLICISTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, WITH JOSE V. LASTARRIA BEING THE MOST PROMINENT AND SERVING AS A CONTRAST. AND THIS CRITICISM ALSO ACQUIRES A RENEWED IMPORTANCE IN THE CURRENT DEBATE THAT TRIES TO DETERMINE THE FORM OF STATE AND, THEREFORE, WHICH THEORY OF JUSTICE, IS MORE ADMISSIBLE FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES THAT NOT ONLY ASPIRE TO PLURALISM BUT ALSO TO SOCIAL JUSTICE.
307	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CHALLENGES (AND RESPONSES THERETO) FOR THOSE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DEVOTED TO MANDATORY MONITORING THE INDIVIDUALS' PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS DURING AND AFTER THE COVID PANDEMIC. IT COVERS THE PRACTICE OF SEVERAL OF THE MAIN REGIONAL (EUROPEAN, INTER-AMERICAN AND AFRICAN) JUDICIAL AND QUASI-JUDICIAL HUMAN RIGHTS BODIES IN A COMPARATIVE OVERVIEW WITH THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING BODIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. THE INTERESTING MEDICAL METAPHOR OF `TRIAGE' (I.E., DESIGNING A SYSTEM OF PRIORITIES TO MAXIMIZE IMPACT, DURING AN EMERGENCY) IS USED TO DISCUSS THE MEASURES TAKEN TO PRESERVE THE RULE OF LAW, BOTH IN THEIR INTERNAL FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS IN PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN NATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS WHEN MONITORING THE STATES' COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS AND GUIDELINES ABOUT COVID-19. WHILE OVERALL, PROCEDURES IN THE DIFFERENT BODIES WERE DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS MAINTAINED, WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO RESPOND TO SIMILAR CRISES IN THE FUTURE, THE PANDEMIC ALSO SHEDS LIGHT ON THE NEED TO REVISIT SOME SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTS IN HUMAN RIGHTS LAW.
308	THE EMERGENT POWER OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO REPLACE IMPERSONAL GENERAL LEGAL RULES WITH PERSONALIZED, PARTICULAR NORMS. WE CONSIDER ARGUMENTS THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD BE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL REPLACING CRUDE, GENERAL LAWS WITH MORE EFFICIENTLY TARGETED WAYS OF MEETING PUBLIC POLICY GOALS AND SATISFYING PERSONAL PREFERENCES. THOSE PROPOSALS POSE A RADICAL, NEW CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW. DATA-DRIVEN LEGAL PERSONALIZATION OFFERS SOME BENEFITS THAT ARE WORTH PURSUING, BUT WE ARGUE THAT THE BENEFITS CAN ONLY LEGITIMATELY BE PURSUED WHERE DOING SO IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AGENCY THAT THE LAW OUGHT TO ACCORD TO INDIVIDUALS AND WITH THE AGENCY THAT THE LAW OUGHT TO ACCORD TO PUBLIC BODIES. THE PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC AGENCY IS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIVATE AGENCY DEPENDS ON THE RULE OF LAW. EACH IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE UNRESTRAINED COMPUTATIONAL PERSONALIZATION OF LAW.
309	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE: IS TO STUDY THE THREATS TO THE INFORMATION SECURITY OF UKRAINE AND TO ANALYZE THE LEGISLATIVE ACTS THAT DEFINE THE TASKS AND FUNCTIONS ENTRUSTED TO RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS TO ENSURE INFORMATION SECURITY OF THE STATE. RESEARCH METHODS: LOGICAL METHOD, NORMATIVE AND DOGMATIC METHOD, MONOGRAPHIC METHOD, SYSTEM AND STRUCTURAL METHOD, GROUPING METHOD, THE METHOD OF GENERALIZATION ARE APPLIED IN THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH. SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO THE CONCEPTS OF "INFORMATION SECURITY", "CYBER SECURITY" AND "RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS" ARE CONSIDERED. THE THREATS TO LEGAL RELATIONS IN THIS AREA ARE IDENTIFIED. PRACTICAL MEANING. THE ROLE, MISSION AND POWERS OF THE RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS IN ENSURING INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY OF UKRAINE ARE ESTABLISHED. SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY. THE NORMATIVE AND LEGAL ACTS, WHICH ENSHRINE THE TASKS AND POWERS OF RULE-OF-LAW INSTITUTIONS IN ENSURING THE INFORMATION SECURITY OF THE STATE IN GENERAL AND CYBER SECURITY IN PARTICULAR, ARE ANALYZED IN DETAIL.
310	RULE OF LAW REFORM IS A KEY FEATURE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU) ENLARGEMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE WESTERN BALKANS. HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED RULE OF LAW NORMS CAN BE CONTENTIOUS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE ROLE DISCURSIVE ENGAGEMENT PLAYS IN AIDING THE DIFFUSION OF CONTESTED RULE OF LAW NORMS. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE DISCURSIVE ENGAGEMENT PLAYS IN OVERCOMING POINTS OF CONTESTATION AND FACILITATING THE CONTEXTUAL DIFFUSION OF RULE OF LAW NORMS. THIS CONCEPTUAL ARGUMENT IS SUBSTANTIATED BY ASSESSING RULE OF LAW REFORMS IN AN EU CANDIDATE STATE, SERBIA. WITHIN THIS CASE STUDY, FOUR INTERNAL CASES ARE OUTLINED. TWO OF THESE CASES DEMONSTRATE THE FAILURE OF RULE OF LAW NORMS TO CONTEXTUALIZE IN THE ABSENCE OF MEANINGFUL DISCURSIVE ENGAGEMENT. THE OTHER TWO CASES DEMONSTRATE THE ROLE DISCURSIVE ENGAGEMENT CAN PLAY IN HELPING TO PROMOTE NORM CONTEXTUALIZATION.
311	USING CROSS-COUNTRY DATA, WE FIND EVIDENCE FOR A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY IN DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF GROWTH-PROMOTING INSTITUTIONS LIKE RULE OF LAW. DEMOCRACY IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW WHEN INEQUALITY IS LOWER. (C) 2007 ELSEVIER B. V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
312	THE COMBINATION OF FLAWED PENALITY, CRUSHING POVERTY AND A NATURAL DISASTER THAT DEVASTATED HAITI'S ALREADY FRAGILE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFRASTRUCTURE MADE THE COUNTRY A FITTING CANDIDATE FOR A NEW KIND OF INTERNATIONAL AID EFFORT, WHICH WE CALL PENAL AID. THIS INTERNATIONAL AID EFFORT USES RULE OF LAW THEORIES AND PRACTICES TO DEVELOP CREDIBLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS AND REFORM PENAL PRACTICE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ACCORDING TO RULE OF LAW MEASURES, DETENTION INDICATES FLAWED JUSTICE AND A WEAK STATE, WHEREAS TRIAL AND TRANSFORMATIVE PUNISHMENT PROMOTES GLOBAL SECURITY AND POVERTY REDUCTION. THE RULE OF LAW IS A METHOD FOR PUNISHING BETTER, A MECHANISM OF INTERNATIONAL AID, A MEASURE OF GLOBAL SECURITY AND A MEANS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF LAW-ABIDING STATES. RULE OF LAW RECONSTRUCTION IS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL STATE-CRAFTING AND REMAKING HAITI IN THE IMAGE OF A GLOBAL PENAL STATE.
313	THIS ARTICLE MAKES A THEORETICAL ARGUMENT FOR REIMAGINING "THE RULE OF LAW" IN LIGHT OF "LEGAL PLURALISM." BUILDING ON THE WORK OF DESMOND MANDERSON AND RODERICK MACDONALD IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS WHAT IT MEANS FOR LAW'S PLURALISM - THE DIFFERENCES THAT ANIMATE THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF LAW - TO BE THE VERY PULSE OF ITS RULE. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE SEEKS TO OPEN THE FRAME THAT HAS BEEN PLACED AROUND THE RULE OF LAW IN TWO WAYS. ON ONE SIDE: TO SEE BEYOND THE LAW THAT IS MADE INTELLIGIBLE THROUGH INSTITUTIONALIZED MODES OF EXPRESSION TO THE LAW THAT IS MADE SENSIBLE THROUGH THE RICHLY EXPRESSIVE MEDIA OF HUMAN CULTURE (THUS OPENING THE FRAME AROUND THE "LAW" THAT IS SEEN TO RULE). AND ON THE OTHER SIDE: TO SEE BEYOND LAW AS A MODE OF GOVERNANCE TO LAW IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF SUBJECTS (THUS OPENING THE FRAME AROUND HOW THIS LAW IS SEEN TO "RULE"). THE RESULT IS A REIMAGINATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A BROADLY SOCIO-CULTURAL PHENOMENON RATHER THAN A NARROWLY LEGAL-INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENT. THE ARTICLE PROCEEDS IN TWO STEPS, BEGINNING WITH LAW'S PLURALISM BEFORE TURNING TO LAW'S RULE.
314	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE FORMATION OF TOTALITARIAN CULTURE IN THE 20TH CENTURY AND HOW IT FOUND WAYS OF CONNECTING TO THE CRITICISM OF THE CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION OF OUR OCCIDENTAL SOCIETIES. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE POSSIBLE CONNECTING LINES OF THIS CRITICISM WITH THE THEORETICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE POLITICAL TRADITION OF FASCISM AND SCHMITT'S POLITICAL AND JURIDICAL THOUGHT. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO REVEAL HOW SOME OF THESE CONNECTIONS REVERBERATED IN THE AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL MOVEMENTS THAT APPEARED STRONG ENOUGH TO UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE DECADES OF 1920S AND 1930S. THIS ARTICLE CONCERN ITSELF WITH THE CONSTANT EXPOSURE OF THE RULE OF LAW (AND ITS TRADITIONS LINKED TO A LIBERAL POLITICAL, DEMOCRATIC AND PARLIAMENTARY CULTURE) TO THE ATTACKS FROM THE TOTALITARIAN POLITICAL CULTURE OF DIFFERENT PATTERNS.
315	THE LEGITIMACY OF A SYSTEM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION DEPENDS INTRINSICALLY ON THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE OF ITS USERS IN ITS DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES, AND THAT IN TURN RESTS ON THE GENERAL ADHERENCE OF THOSE PROCESSES TO THE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES THAT CONSTITUTE THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION HAS LONG BEEN A CLOSE PARTNER OF THE COURTS IN SUSTAINING THE RULE OF LAW, SOME OF ARBITRATION'S KEY FEATURES AND PRACTICES - SUCH AS ITS CONSENT-BASED LIMITATIONS, ITS PREDISPOSITION TOWARD CONFIDENTIALITY, ITS LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF PERMITTING PARTIES TO UNILATERALLY APPOINT ARBITRATORS, AND ITS PHILOSOPHY THAT PARTIES HAVE NO RIGHT TO A RIGHT ANSWER - MEAN THAT ARBITRATION SUPPORTS AN ATTENUATED MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THAT IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF CONSCIOUS DECISIONS TO FORGO CERTAIN RULE OF LAW VALUES IN ORDER TO REALIZE OTHER GOALS. BUT THE PROBLEM OF RISING COSTS AND DELAYS, UNDERPINNED BY ARBITRATION'S GROWING PROCEDURAL RIGIDITY AND LACK OF AGILITY, EXACTS A HEAVY PRICE ON ARBITRATION'S USERS AND THEIR CONFIDENCE IN ARBITRATION, WITHOUT OBVIOUS RETURNS. WE MUST BE COGNIZANT OF ARBITRATION'S SACRIFICE IN TERMS OF RULE OF LAW VALUES WHEN SEEKING TO ADVANCE OTHER OBJECTIVES, AND REGULARLY REFLECT ON WHETHER THOSE GAINS ARE STILL WORTH THEIR COST.
316	CHINA IS NOT MEETING ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPRS), HARMING THE INNOVATION PROCESS IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE. WE REVIEW THE BENEFITS OF IPR PROTECTION AND DISCUSS THE MAGNITUDE AND COST OF CHINA'S IPR VIOLATIONS. WE ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE VIOLATIONS UNDERMINE THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND IMPAIR CHINA'S LEGITIMACY AS A LEADER IN EVOLVING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS. WE CRITICIZE THE ARGUMENT THAT CHINA WILL ENDOGENOUSLY IMPROVE IPR PROTECTION DUE TO INTERNAL PRESSURES FROM ITS DOMESTIC IP SECTOR AS THE UNITED STATES AND SOME OTHER COUNTRIES DID IN THE PAST. CHINA'S GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE LIBERAL WESTERN DEMOCRACIES, PAST AND PRESENT, AS CHINA HAS A WEAK INTERNAL RULE OF LAW, A FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE SYSTEM, AND CULTURAL TRADITIONS THAT FAVOR COLLECTIVE OVER INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. AS CHINA'S IP SECTOR DEVELOPS, ITS IPR GOVERNANCE REGIME MIGHT EVEN BE USED AS A STRATEGIC TOOL TO FURTHER DISADVANTAGE FOREIGN IPR HOLDERS. WE ARGUE THAT CHINA SHOULD PLAY A LEAD ROLE IN ANY INTERNATIONAL IPR REFORMS BUT THAT IT MUST FIRST ESTABLISH LEGITIMACY BY MEETING ITS CURRENT INTERNATIONAL IPR COMMITMENTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD TAKE ACTION TO PRESSURE CHINA TO MEET ITS IPR OBLIGATIONS.
317	THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL FEATURES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE IN UKRAINE. IT IS NOTED THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE IN UKRAINE INVOLVES THE INTERACTION OF SEVERAL SOCIO-CULTURAL, IDEOLOGICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL-LEGAL ASPECTS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH AT PRESENT IS BURDENED WITH VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES OF AN OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE NATURE. IN PARTICULAR, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY ARE OPTIMIZATION OF THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT SYSTEM AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LAW-MAKING, INCREASING THE LEVEL OF PROFESSIONALISM AND CIVIL LIABILITY OF OFFICIALS OF ALL LEVELS, OVERCOMING IMBALANCE IN GOVERNMENT AND EFFECTIVE LEGAL SUPPORT OF THIS PROCESS, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EUROPEAN TRADITION OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE.
318	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CRITICISM THAT INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS UNDERMINES THE RULE OF LAW. WITH REFERENCE TO AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED STATES, AND ENGLAND AND WALES, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES TWO COMPETING APPROACHES TO SENTENCING OFFENDERS: INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS AND TWO-TIER SENTENCING. IN PARTICULAR, HE EXAMINES HOW THESE APPROACHES SQUARE AGAINST VARIOUS CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. ULTIMATELY, THE AUTHOR REJECTS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE INSTINCTIVE SYNTHESIS APPROACH IS CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW.
319	THE PAST DECADE HAS WITNESSED A REVIVAL IN INTEREST IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. DISENCHANTMENT WITH THE UNIVERSAL MODEL THAT EMERGED FROM THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS ERA LED TO A SHIFT IN FOCUS TO A MORE PLURALIST APPROACH IN WHICH POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS BECAME TAILORED TO EACH COUNTRY'S SOCIO-POLITICAL CONTEXT. THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT THE PENDULUM MAY HAVE SWUNG TO THE OTHER EXTREME, AND THAT THE NEWLY ASCENDANT PLURALIST APPROACH MAY OVEREMPHASIZE PLURALISM AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE RULE OF LAW BUILDING EFFORTS PURSUED BY THE BRIC COUNTRIES TO SHED LIGHT ON THEIR STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT PROCESSES OF ECONOMIC TRANSITION. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT FORMAL, INFORMAL, AND TRANSITIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE PLAYED DISTINCT ROLES IN THESE DIVERGENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT NARRATIVES. WHILE INFORMAL AND TRANSITIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE FACILITATED GROWTH DURING INITIAL AND INTERMEDIATE PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT, A DEGREE OF FORMALIZATION ACROSS SOME INSTITUTIONS IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF A MARKET ECONOMY. THE AUTHORS SET OUT THE CORE TENETS APPROACH, AN EXPLORATORY CONCEPT THAT EMPHASIZES A MALLEABLE SET OF FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES WHICH EXIST ALONGSIDE TRANSITION INSTITUTIONS TO BUILD TRUST IN FORMAL INSTITUTIONS AS AN ECONOMY ADVANCES.
320	MODERN BRAZIL IS PLAGUED BY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, ENDEMIC VIOLENCE, CRIME, AND A WEAK RULE OF LAW. ONCE THESE NARRATIVES BECOME DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER, ALL ASPECTS MUST BE WORKED ON TO CHANGE THE SCENARIO THE COUNTRY IS FACING: INSECURITY, FEAR AND A LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE UNPRECEDENTED RISE OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE IN BRAZIL IS NOT THE RESULT OF SHORT-TERM MEASURES BUT IS PART OF ITS HISTORY MARKED BY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITIES EXTENDING FROM ITS COLONIAL PAST UNTIL TODAY AND THE DEFICIENT POLICIES ON CRIME THAT EMERGED IN THE MID-1990S. MOREOVER, THE CURRENT MASSIVE INCARCERATION, OVERCROWDING OF PRISONS COMBINED WITH THE ABSENCE OF HUMAN LIVING CONDITIONS IS TURNING THE PRISON SYSTEM IN BRAZIL INTO A GIGANTIC, PERPETUAL SCHOOL OF CRIME. INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION THAT DIRECTLY HELPS TO LOWER THE CRIME RATE MUST BE ALIGNED WITH A NEW, LESS REPRESSIVE AND MORE INCLUSIVE PUNITIVE POLICY SO AS TO INDUCE CRIMINALS NOT TO RETURN TO THEIR UNLAWFUL WAYS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT BRAZIL CAN ONLY PROPERLY DEVELOP IF EFFICIENT LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONING BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL CITIZENS.
321	THE ISSUE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CRITERION FOR THE ACTION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES HAS NOT YET BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WIDER DOCTRINAL REFLECTION. THE REASON FOR THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS IS PROBABLY THE RATHER SPARING REFERENCE BY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BODIES TO THE RULE OF LAW AS A BASIS FOR THEIR DECISIONS. MEANWHILE, THE OBLIGATION IMPOSED ON THE AUTHORITIES IN ARTICLE 7 OF THE CODE OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE TREATED AS ONE OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES IN ONGOING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS. THE PRESENT STUDY FOCUSES ON SIGNALLING ONLY SOME OF THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE GROUNDS OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE, INDICATING THE AMBIGUITY OF THIS PHRASE AND THE RELATED VARIOUS UNDER STANDINGS OF IT. THE CONCLUSIONS SHOULD BE REGARDED AS AN INVITATION TO DISCUSS THIS UNDOUBTEDLY COMPLEX ISSUE.
322	FOCUSSING ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGAL COLONISATION AND LEGAL GLOBALISATION IN THE CONTEXT OF POST-CONFLICT PEACEBUILDING AND RECONSTRUCTION, I ARGUE THAT PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS SOCIAL DOMINATION OVER LOCAL ECONOMIES, POLITICS AND SOCIETIES HAS BEEN, HISTORICALLY, CORE TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS. LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORMS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO RESTORE AND STRENGTHEN THE POST-CONFLICT STATE, NOT ONLY SERVE TO OBFUSCATE HISTORICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SETTLER-COLONIAL RULE BUT ALSO RECONSTITUTE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOMINANT DOMESTIC ACTORS AND GLOBAL CAPITAL. MOREOVER, WHEREAS RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION HAS INCREASINGLY BEEN PROFESSIONALISED AND STANDARDISED, THE UNDERLYING OBJECTIVES TO PROMOTE NEOLIBERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, SUBORDINATE INDIGENOUS LEGAL SYSTEMS, AND ADVANCING RULING INTERESTS REMAIN THE ENDURING LEGACIES OF LEGAL COLONIALISM. IN MAKING THIS ARGUMENT, I INTERROGATE THE UNDERLYING IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL DRIVERS OF THE UK-SUPPORTED JUSTICE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT IN SIERRA LEONE AND THE US-FUNDED RULE-OF-LAW PROGRAMMES IN LIBERIA.
323	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES APPROACHES TO DEFENDING THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY - ONE OF THE MAIN INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW - ADOPTED BY CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS (CSOS) IN POLAND SINCE 2015. BEGINNING BY DESCRIBING THE RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN CONTEXT, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS REACTED TO THE ORCHESTRATED THREATS TO JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN POLAND. THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING FOR THE CIVIC SPACE, PROVING THAT THE ROLE OF CSOS WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW (JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, IN PARTICULAR), BUT ALSO TO FIGHT THE SHRINKING CIVIC SPACE. THIS ARTICLE SURVEYS THE CONCEPT OF THE 'RULE OF LAW FROM BELOW' BY CRITICALLY ANALYSING THE ACTIONS OF CSOS IN RESPONSE TO ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, PROVIDING A PART OF A BROADER 'RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING' PICTURE. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF TWO CASE STUDIES - REACTIONS FROM CSOS TO POLAND'S SO-CALLED 'REFORM OF THE JUDICIARY'.
324	PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IS A POTENTIALLY STRONG LEGITIMATING NARRATIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. ILLUSTRATING THE INTERLINKAGE, THE UBIQUITOUS 'FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT' (FET) STANDARD EMBODIES DISTINCTLY RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS. BUT THESE REQUIREMENTS REMAIN OPEN-TEXTURED AND ALLOW UNDERSTANDING THEIR MEANING IN EITHER MORE 'INTERNATIONAL' OR 'NATIONAL' WAY. AN 'INTERNATIONAL' UNDERSTANDING-DETACHED FROM THE HOST STATE'S VISION ON HOW THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD LOOK LIKE-SHOULD REMAIN DOMINANT. BUT I ARGUE THAT DECISION-MAKING UNDER THE FET STANDARD SHOULD ALSO INVOLVE A SYSTEMATIC ENGAGEMENT WITH HOW THESE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE HOST STATE'S LAW AND HOW THEY WERE COMPLIED WITH FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. WHILST NOT DETERMINATIVE FOR ESTABLISHING A BREACH, THIS ASSESSMENT BETTER RESPECTS THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PARTIES, STRENGTHENS THE PERSUASIVENESS OF FINDINGS AND HELPS ENHANCE THE NATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF INVESTMENT PROTECTION-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
325	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE WILL ANALYSE THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE CURRENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE OCCURRING IN SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBER STATES AND THE MECHANISMS THAT THE EU HAS TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER THAT, WE WILL ANALYSE THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL TO CONDITIONATE EU FUNDS TO THE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES, ALONG WITH THE RISKS INHERENT TO THIS METHOD, THE POSITION OF THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS AND THE DETAILS OF ITS PROCESSING, TO OBTAIN CONCLUSIONS REFERRING TO ITS SUITABILITY FOR THE CURRENT NECESSITIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
326	THIS PAPER OFFERS AN OVERVIEW OF THE EMERGING DOMAIN OF MOBILE GOVERNANCE AS AN OFFSPRING OF THE BROADER LANDSCAPE OF E-GOVERNANCE. MOBILE GOVERNANCE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED EVERYWHERE IN PARALLEL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CROWDSOURCED, OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT FACILITATE THE COLLECTION, AGGREGATION, AND DISSEMINATION OF BOTH INFORMATION AND DATA COMING FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES: CITIZENS, ORGANIZATIONS, PUBLIC BODIES, ETC. ULTIMATELY, MOBILE GOVERNANCE CAN BE SEEN AS A TOOL TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW FROM A DECENTRALIZED, DISTRIBUTED, AND BOTTOM-UP PERSPECTIVE.
327	IN THEIR MOST RECENT BOOK, RULE OF LAW REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT: CHARTING THE FRAGILE PATH OF PROGRESS, MICHAEL TREBILCOCK AND RON DANIELS SHOW HOW RULE OF LAW REFORMS HAVE A MIXED-NOT TO SAY DISAPPOINTING-TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESSES. THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS THAT SOCIAL-HISTORICAL-CULTURAL FACTORS AND RESISTANCE FROM INTEREST GROUPS ARE TWO OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO REFORM. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THESE TWO OBSTACLES IN GREATER DEPTH. WITH RESPECT TO SOCIAL-HISTORICAL-CULTURAL FACTORS, MY MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT EARLY RULE OF LAW REFORMS CAN CREATE VALUES, PRACTICES, AND ATTITUDES THAT MAY BECOME IMPEDIMENTS TO FUTURE REFORMS. ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY FRONT, THESE EARLY REFORMS CAN STRENGTHEN INTEREST GROUPS THAT WILL BLOCK FUTURE REFORMS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, POLICY MAKERS FACE A PARADOX: ROBUST RULE OF LAW REFORMS EARLY ON MAY UNDERMINE BROADER REFORM EFFORTS BY REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER NECESSARY REFORMS DOWN THE ROAD, CREATING A REFORM TRAP. I ILLUSTRATE THE PARADOX WITH A BRAZILIAN CASE STUDY AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE.
328	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CURRENT CUBAN POLITICAL REALITY THROUGH AN APPROACH THAT FOCUSES ON THE POLITICAL ACTIONS OF GENERATIONS, THEIR MODES OF REPRODUCTION AND WHAT IS CONSIDERED AS CONSTITUTIONAL AS A WAY OF SYNTHESIZING AND DEFENDING THEIR ASPIRATIONS AND GOALS FOR SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHANGE. TO THIS END, IT EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 2019 CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLARATION OF THE CUBAN STATE AS A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHILE EXPLORING THE IMPORTANCE AND COMPLEXITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE CITIZENSHIP IN A SOCIETY THAT, LIKE THE CUBAN ONE, IS EXPERIENCING, IN THE MIDST OF A CONTEXT OF ECONOMIC CRISIS AND A PANDEMIC, A PROCESS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TRANSITION.
329	UNTIL NOW, DEMOCRACY RESEARCH HAS HARDLY LOOKED INTO HOW THE HANDLING OF THE PREVIOUS REGIME'S HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF YOUNG DEMOCRACIES TO CONSOLIDATE. THE ARTICLE SUPPORTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY INFLUENCES CERTAIN DEMOCRATIC PARTIAL REGIMES, AND FOCUSES ON THE RULE OF LAW DIMENSION. WHILE DISCUSSING POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF RECONCILIATION WORK ON THE EVOLUTION OF STANDARDS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THEORY, THE ARTICLE ALSO POINTS OUT THE CHALLENGES OF SPECIFYING AND MEASURING THE CONCEPTS PERTAINING TO DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES PROVIDE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RECONCILIATION WORK AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE CHALLENGES OF FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFECT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ARE EXAMINED IN THIS LIGHT.
330	BUILDING ON INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RELATIVE RULE OF LAW OF HOME AND HOST COUNTRIES, THE HOME COUNTRY'S INSTITUTIONAL FRAME AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI). WE SUGGEST THAT FIRMS BASED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF RULE OF LAW WILL INVEST MORE FDI PER CAPITA IN HOST COUNTRIES WITH COMPARABLE OR HIGHER LEVELS OF LEGAL PROTECTIONS. FURTHER, COMPANIES BASED IN COUNTRIES WITH A LOWER RULE OF LAW ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LOWER DEGREES OF INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS. FOR THESE LATTER COUNTRIES, THE COMPARABLE LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW BETWEEN HOME AND HOST COUNTRY WILL NOT AS STRONGLY IMPACT FDI PER CAPITA. WE TEST OUR LOGIC THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF FDI FROM TWO HOME COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW: JAPAN (HIGH) AND SOUTH KOREA (MEDIUM). USING FDI DATA FROM JAPANESE FIRMS IN 114 COUNTRIES AND SOUTH KOREAN FIRMS IN 118 COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT WHILE RULE OF LAW IS A PREDICTOR OF FDI PER CAPITA, THE RELATIVE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW BETWEEN HOME AND HOST COUNTRIES IN HIGHER RULE OF LAW HOME COUNTRIES IS ALSO IMPORTANT. IN ADDITION, WE DISCOVER THAT COMPANIES FROM JAPAN, A HIGH RULE OF LAW COUNTRY DO SEEK OUT SIMILAR OR HIGHER RULE OF LAW ENVIRONMENTS FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF FDI PER CAPITA INVESTMENTS WHILE COMPANIES FROM A MEDIUM LEVEL RULE OF LAW COUNTRY, SOUTH KOREA, ARE LESS BEHOLDEN TO INSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS. OUR STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF COUNTRY-LEVEL FACTORS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT DECISIONS, SUGGESTING THAT IT IS THE COMPARATIVE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE VALUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE HOME COUNTRY.
331	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO PRESENT THE ORIGIN, DEVELOPMENT AND ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW (RECHTSSTAAT). BORN WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF GERMAN PUBLIC LAW SCIENCE TOWARDS THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY, IT BECAME ESTABLISHED AS A KEY CONCEPT IN THEORY OF PUBLIC LAW THROUGH KELSEN'S WORK. THE RULE OF LAW IS, IN ITS ORIGIN, A STRICTLY FORMAL CONCEPT, WITH THE FOLLOWING ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES: THE EQUIVALENCE OF LAW AND THE STATE AND THE COMPLETE ADAPTATION OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE STATE TO THE LEGAL ORDER. MATERIAL ASPECTS ARE LEFT OUT, SUCH AS THE INTRODUCTION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE STATE. FOR OVER A CENTURY NOW, THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS PRESIDED OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE GENERAL THEORY OF LAW.
332	THE RISE OF ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE) HAS HIT THE DOMESTIC JUDICIARIES PARTICULARLY HARD. VIKTOR ORBAN EXPANDED THE SIZE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THEN PACKED IT, MADE SURE THAT HE CAN INSTALL A NEW PRESIDENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, OUSTED THE SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT THROUGH A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, DISEMPOWERED THE EXISTING JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND CREATED THE NEW INSTITUTION WITH POWER OVER ORDINARY JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. JAROSLAV KACZYNSKI FOLLOWED THE SAME PLAYBOOK IN POLAND. WHILE MOST SCHOLARS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON EFFECTS OF ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM UPON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, WE ARGUE THAT THE KEYS TO THE LONG-TERM CONTROL OF THE JUDICIARY ARE PRESIDENTS OF ORDINARY COURTS AND JUDICIAL COUNCILS. THE DISMISSAL OF THE HUNGARIAN SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS LOGIC-BY THIS MOVE ORBAN GOT RID OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COURT PRESIDENT IN THE COUNTRY, THE HEAD OF THE HUNGARIAN JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND HIS MOST VOCAL CRITIC. YET, ANDRAS BAKA LODGED AN APPLICATION TO THE ECTHR AND WON. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE GRAND CHAMBER JUDGMENT IN BAKA V. HUNGARY, ITS IMPLICATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE LIMITS OF WHAT THE ECTHR CAN ACHIEVE AGAINST ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE GRAND CHAMBER FAILED ON ALL KEY FRONTS. IT OVERLOOKED THE MAIN STRUCTURAL PROBLEM BEHIND MR. BAKA'S DISMISSAL (THE BROAD POWERS OF COURT PRESIDENTS IN CEE), IT HAS BLURRED THE CONVENTION'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND IT FAILED IN DELIVERING A PERSUASIVE JUDGMENT FIRMLY BASED ON THE EXISTING ECTHR'S CASE LAW.
333	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE PHENOMENON OF THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION EXERCISED BY THE EU THROUGH THE DEEP AND COMPREHENSIVE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS (DCFTAS). FIRST, THE ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE UNIQUE COMBINATION OF NORMATIVE AND MARKET POWER THE EU USES TO DIFFUSE ITS NORMS THROUGH TRADE LIBERALIZATION. NEXT, IT PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY AS A POLICY CONTEXT FOR THE CONCLUSION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THE DCFTAS WITH UKRAINE, MOLDOVA AND GEORGIA, AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMATIC AND SCOPE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A VALUE THE EU SEEKS TO EXTERNALIZE. USING THE DCFTAS WITH UKRAINE, MOLDOVA, AND GEORGIA) AS A SINGLE GROUP CASE STUDY OF THE TRANSPARENCY DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE CENTRAL PART OF THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE DCFTAS SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS, DIRECTED TOWARD PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY IN THE PARTNER STATES (WHILE CATEGORIZING THE REQUIREMENTS INTO THE MOST GENERAL ONES; COOPERATION-RELATED; AND DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC) AND THE LEGAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE THESE CLAUSES OPERATIONAL (E.G., THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE AAS, GRADUAL APPROXIMATION AND MONITORING CLAUSES, AND THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISM). IN CONCLUDING, THE ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION THROUGH THE DCFTAS, DISTINGUISHES THE MAJOR CHALLENGES THE RESPECTIVE PHENOMENON FACES, AND EMPHASIZES THE PROSPECTS FOR AND DIFFICULTIES OF USING THE DCFTAS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION.
334	BACKGROUND: THE LINKS BETWEEN POLLUTION, INSTITUTIONS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH MAY BE NOT SO UNIVOCAL AS ARGUED IN THE LITERATURE, AS THESE FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE EACH OTHER SINCE SOME REVERSE CAUSALITY MAY EXIST BETWEEN THEM. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS RELATIONSHIP IS IMPORTANT FOR IDENTIFYING APPROPRIATE POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. METHODS: WE INVESTIGATE THE LONG-RUN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLLUTION, INSTITUTIONS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, CONSIDERING AS VARIABLES CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, RULE OF LAW, AND INCOME. THE MODEL OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF CAUSALITY DIRECTION USING A PANEL-VAR APPROACH FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2010 FOR 33 HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES THAT INCLUDE ADVANCED, EMERGING, AND FORMER-TRANSITION ECONOMIES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A POSITIVE REVERSE CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND INCOME, INDICATING THAT HIGHER INCOME IMPLIES STRONGER RULE OF LAW AND VICE VERSA. THE RULE OF LAW IS FOUND TO HAVE A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH POLLUTION, CONFIRMING THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF RULES IS "A CONDITIO SINE QUA NON" TO CONTROL EMISSIONS. NO CAUSALITY RELATIONSHIP IS FOUND FOR POLLUTION AND INCOME THAT CAN BE DUE TO THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGING, FORMER-TRANSITION, AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, IMPLYING HETEROGENEITY IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION POLICIES. CONCLUSIONS: WE ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW MATTERS BOTH FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ENVIRONMENT, WORKING AS A GO-BETWEEN AND CREATING A WIN-WIN SITUATION, WHERE STRONGER INSTITUTIONS INCREASE THE LEVELS OF INCOME AND VICE VERSA. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, A POLICY MAKER SHOULD ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR BOTH MONITORING THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS ENFORCEMENT.
335	THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF FOUR LEGAL ORIGINS (I.E., ENGLISH, FRENCH, GERMAN, AND SCANDINAVIAN) OF A SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES ON THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE AND RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO EXAMINES HOW THESE FACTORS AFFECT THE SIZE OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY BANKS AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. WE FOUND THAT THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE AND RULE OF LAW AFFECT BOTH THE SIZE OF BANK CREDIT AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE CORRELATED. FURTHERMORE, THE MARGINAL EFFECTS OF THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE AND THE RULE OF LAW ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE DIFFER BY LEGAL ORIGIN.
336	BEFORE THOSE PHENOMENA WHICH, IN THE NAME OF RIGHTS, CONCEAL VIOLATIONS OF OTHER'S INTERESTS, THE ITALIAN AUTHOR PROPOSES THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE DWORKIN STYLE STRATEGY, WHICH UNDERLINES INVIOLABILITY AND MORAL IRREVOCABILITY OF SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS, BY A MECHANISM WHICH PROTECTS THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY, THAT IS, TO MAKE USE OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: ABUSE OF A RIGHT, OF POWER AND OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN ORDER TO UNVEIL EXCESSES AND TO FULFIL THE LAWFUL AIMS FOR WHICH THE RIGHTS IN QUESTION WERE CONCEIVED. AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE CONTEMPORARY THEORETICAL TRENDS WHICH FOCUS ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RULES AND PRINCIPLES IN LAW (ALEXY, ATIENZA AND RUIZ MANERO, DWORKIN, RAZ), PALOMBELLA SUPPORTS THE VERACITY OF HIS ASSERTIONS WITH TWO U.S SUPREME COURT CASES.
337	OUR ARTICLE PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF ITALIAN PROVINCES AND THE QUALITY OF THEIR LOCAL INSTITUTIONS, SPECIFICALLY THE RULE OF LAW, OVER THE PERIOD 2004-2016. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT ECONOMETRIC APPROACHES (OLS, FE, SYS-GMM), IN GENERAL A SECURE AND WELL-DEFINED LEGAL FRAMEWORK - BY REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY, FACILITATING CAPITAL ACCUMULATION AND AN INCREASE IN THE FIRMS' SCALE OF PRODUCTION - IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER EXPORT PERFORMANCE. INTERESTINGLY, WHEN THE ANALYSIS IS REPLICATED AT THE LEVEL OF THE ITALIAN MACRO-AREAS (NORTH, CENTRE AND SOUTH), THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH EXPORT PERFORMANCE ONLY IN NORTHERN PROVINCES, THUS SUGGESTING THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS INSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION MIGHT DEPEND ON THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, I.E. ONLY WHEN A SET OF SUITABLE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE MECHANISMS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.
338	UNTIL NOW, DEMOCRACY RESEARCH HAS HARDLY LOOKED INTO HOW THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PREVIOUS REGIME'S HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE DEALT WITH AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF YOUNG DEMOCRACIES TO CONSOLIDATE. THE ARTICLE SUPPORTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE ONLY INFLUENCES CERTAIN DEMOCRATIC PARTIAL REGIMES AND FOCUSES ON THE RULE OF LAW DIMENSION. WHILE DISCUSSING POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF RECONCILIATION WORK ON THE EVOLUTION OF STANDARDS AND INSTITUTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THEORY, THE ARTICLE ALSO POINTS OUT THE CHALLENGES OF SPECIFYING AND MEASURING THE CONCEPTS PERTAINING TO THE DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES PROVIDE CLEAR INDICATIONS OF A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RECONCILIATION WORK AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE CHALLENGES OF FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFECT OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ARE EXAMINED IN THIS LIGHT.
339	THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE POLITICAL DYNAMICS SHAPING THE POST-2010 'DE-EUROPEANISATION' OF TURKEY'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY REGARDING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND RULE OF LAW. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THE LIMITS OF CONVENTIONAL EUROPEANISATION ACCOUNTS EMPHASISING CAUSAL FACTORS SUCH AS EUROPEAN UNION (EU) CONDITIONALITY AND THE 'LOCK-IN EFFECTS' OF LIBERAL REFORMS DUE TO THE BENEFITS OF EU ACCESSION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY'S (AKP'S) BID FOR POLITICAL HEGEMONY RESULTED IN THE REVERSAL OF RULE OF LAW REFORMS. DE-EUROPEANISATION IS DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF BOTH LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND THE GOVERNMENT'S OBSERVED DISCOURSE SHIFT.
340	THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES A SPECIAL ISSUE ON THE EMERGENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RHETORIC AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IT THEMATICALLY INTRODUCES FOUR COUNTRY CASE STUDIES (CAMBODIA, MYANMAR, THAILAND AND VIETNAM), AND THE CASE OF ASEAN'S ADOPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN REGION-BUILDING, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. WE HIGHLIGHT HOW IDEALS THAT ARE ARGUABLY CENTRAL TO THE "TRADITION" OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE BEING EXCISED, MARGINALISED, DEFENDED AND/OR UNDERMINED IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN CONTEXTS. WE EMPHASISE HOW THE VERY CONCEPT IS DEEPLY CONTESTED AND FAR FROM NEUTRAL - AT STAKE IS THE VERY NOTION OF "LAW" FOR WHOM, AND FOR WHAT. THE ARTICLE OFFERS INSIGHT INTO THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS AFFECTING HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS BEING INTERPRETED BY POLITICAL ACTORS AND HOW IT IS BEING CONTESTED AND CONSOLIDATED VIA GOVERNANCE PRACTICES IN THE REGION, AND PROPOSES NEW AVENUES FOR RESEARCH IN ASSESSING HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS OPERATING IN TRANSITIONAL AND AUTHORITARIAN STATE SETTINGS.
341	ARGUMENTS CONCERNING LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE CALL FOR A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEGITIMACY, THE RULE OF LAW, AND RESPECT FOR RIGHTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT A GOVERNMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE RULE OF LAW, THE HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF ITS CITIZENS ARE ADVANCED. WHEN CITIZENS CAN BRING DISPUTES CONCERNING RIGHTS TO COURT RATHER THAN FIGHT IN THE STREETS, THE RULE OF LAW IS ENHANCED. RESPECT FOR RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE LIKELY TO MAKE A GOVERNMENT MORE ACCEPTABLE AND HENCE MORE LEGITIMATE. A BASIC REQUIREMENT OF LEGITIMACY IS THAT GOVERNMENT ADVANCE EVERYONE'S SHARE OF PRIMARY SOCIAL GOODS, THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY AND HENCE THEIR BASIC RIGHTS. RIGHTS ARE NOT ONLY STATEMENTS OF IDEALS OR ENTITLEMENTS BUT GOALS AND TOOLS FOR PURSUIT OF THOSE GOALS, MEANS FOR PURSUING LAW REFORM, ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW, AND ENHANCING SOCIETY'S LEGITIMACY.
342	THIS WORK DISCUSSES A WORLDVIEW AND A METHODOLOGY CONCERNING IDEOLOGICAL APPROACHES BY WHICH MARXISTS CAN UNDERSTAND AND TRANSFORM THE WORLD, BASED ON WELL-DEFINED VALUE TRUTH, THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY. THE WORK BUILDS ON THE REPORT TO THE 20TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA ( CPC), WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES TO WHICH XI JINPING THOUGHT ON SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS FOR A NEW ERA MUST ADHERE: PUTTING THE PEOPLE FIRST, MAINTAINING SELF-CONFIDENCE AND SELF- RELIANCE, UPHOLDING FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND BREAKING NEW GROUND, ADOPTING A PROBLEM-ORIENTED APPROACH, APPLYING SYSTEM THINKING, AND MAINTAINING A GLOBAL VISION. FURTHERMORE, THIS WORK ARGUES THAT THESE PRIORITIES SHOULD BE APPLIED TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA'S NEW JOURNEY. AS THE STARTING POINTS OF ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTANDING, THE META-THEORY AND "SIX MUST-DOS" FOLLOW THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MARXISM IN INTERPRETING AND PROMOTING SOCIALIST CONCEPTS, THEORY, LAW-BASED PATH AND LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW ERA WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. THE METATHEORY AND THE "SIX MUST-DOS" PROVIDE THE LOGICAL FOUNDATIONS AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPLIANCE WITH XI JINPING THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW. ONLY BY APPLYING THESE "SIX MUST-DOS" WELL CAN WE UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT XI JINPING THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW, ENHANCE THE RATIONALITY, INITIATIVE, FORESIGHT AND CREATIVITY OF OUR WORK IN COMPREHENSIVELY PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA.
343	BEYOND BEING A DESCRIPTIVE FRAMEWORK OF THE LEGAL UNIVERSE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, LEGAL PLURALISM HAS BECOME A POLICY FIELD IN THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROBLEMATIZE AND CLARIFY HOW LEGAL PLURALISM HAS BEEN DEPLOYED FOR RULE OF LAW, AND ON WHAT GROUNDS SUSTAINABLE RULE OF LAW THROUGH LEGAL PLURALISM HOLD. DUE TO THE SYNCRETIC NATURE OF THE STATE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, IT IS CONTENDED THAT LEGAL PLURALISM IS CONFIGURED WITH A JANUS FACE. WHILE ONE FACE OF LEGAL PLURALISM CONNECTS THE STATE TO THE SOCIETY AND IS POSITIONED TO MAINTAIN INTERNAL PEACE AND ORDER, THE OTHER FACE CONNECTS THE STATE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND CONSEQUENTLY SHIELDS IT FROM EXTERNAL THREAT. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A SUSTAINABLE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION RESTS ON THE DIALECTIC OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS AND THE JANUS FACED CONFIGURATION OF LEGAL PLURALISM IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.
344	WHILE THE TOPIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS BECOME MORE PROMINENT IN STUDIES OF SOUTHEAST ASIA, SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN DIFFICULT IN VIETNAM. AFTER THE ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION OF 1986, SCHOLARS SAW NEW TRENDS, AS RELIGIONS GREW IN SIZE AND ASPIRATIONS IN SPITE OF SCANT POLICY RELAXATION. THERE HAVE BEEN SHIFTS IN STATE DISCOURSE AND IDEOLOGY ON RELIGION. FUTURE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESEARCH SHOULD: EXAMINE NOT JUST MACRO FACTORS BUT ALSO THE INTERESTS AND PASSIONS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE; BETTER INTEGRATE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM STUDIES WITH ETHNIC STUDIES; AND EXPAND DATA SOURCES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR COMPARATIVE EMPIRICAL STUDIES.
345	AN EMERGING STRAND OF RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THE ROLE OF THE MACRO INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT IN SHAPING THE SOCIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WELL-BEING. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE VARIATIONS IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLITICAL POWER AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING BY HOW THE RULE OF LAW IS INSTITUTED ACROSS SOCIETIES. TWO HYPOTHESES OF THE RULE OF LAW ROLE ARE TESTED: (A) POWER-TEMPERING AND (B) POWER-ENHANCEMENT HYPOTHESES. WE USE A UNIQUE DATASET OF 30,491 INDIVIDUALS FROM 27 COUNTRIES WITH DIVERSE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS. WE FIRST CONFIRMED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR POSITIONS IN THE POWER HIERARCHY AND THEIR OVERALL SATISFACTION WITH THEIR LIVES USING MODELS WITH COUNTRY-LEVEL FIXED EFFECTS. MOREOVER, THIS RELATIONSHIP SIGNIFICANTLY VARIES ACROSS COUNTRIES, AND THE RULE OF LAW INDEX EXPLAINS PART OF THE VARIATION, AS INDICATED BY RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS. IN SOCIETIES WITH WELL-DEFINED, UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE, AND FAIR LAWS, THE ASSOCIATION OF ONE'S POSITION OF POWER AND SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING IS REDUCED. OUR STUDY ILLUSTRATES THAT INSTITUTIONS OF BETTER QUALITY AND FUNCTIONING MAY EQUALIZE ACCESS TO WELL-BEING.
346	IN THIS REVIEW OF THE LATE TOM (LORD) BINGHAM'S LAST BOOK ON THE RULE OF LAW I BRIEFLY NOTE THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY NORMAL TROPE OF (GLOBAL) POLITICS, BEFORE SETTING OUT BINGHAM'S CHARACTERISATION OF THE NORM ITSELF. I THEN ASK HOW WE MIGHT EXPLAIN THE ASCENDANCE OF THE TERM (IN LIGHT OF BINGHAM'S LACK OF INTEREST IN THE ISSUE), SUCH THAT BINGHAM'S BOOK MIGHT FIND A MAINSTREAM NON-ACADEMIC PUBLISHER. BINGHAM, T. (2010) THE RULE OF LAW. LONDON: ALLEN LANE.
347	UN PEACE OPERATIONS UNDERTAKE A BROAD ARRAY OF RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES AIMING TO REBUILD THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND END IMPUNITY. RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES IN UN PEACE OPERATIONS HAVE MATURED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS SINCE THE UN EXPERIMENTS WITH STATEBUILDING IN KOSOVO AND EAST TIMOR. TODAY, RULE OF LAW ACTIVITIES CAN OFTEN CLEARLY BE SEEN TO ADVANCE THE BROADER GOAL OF ESTABLISHING THE HOST STATE AS THE LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY. THIS PAPER FIRST DISCUSSES THE UN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND WHY THE UN HAS CHOSEN TO UNDERPIN ITS PEACEBUILDING AGENDA WITH ENDING IMPUNITY. SECOND, TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN MINUSCA IS DISCUSSED INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL CRIMINAL COURT. THIRD, UNMISS IS INVESTIGATED WHERE THE UN HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE OF ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW ON PROTECTION OF CIVILIAN SITES. LASTLY, THE PROMISE OF LOCAL JUSTICE IS ASSESSED. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT WHILE ENDING IMPUNITY AND STRENGTHENING FORMAL INSTITUTIONS CAN BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS DO NOT PERSIST, THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OVERARCHING, BOTTOM-UP STRATEGY IN PLACE TO ENGAGE AND EMPOWER LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND OTHER CIVIL ACTORS, TO BE PART OF THE RULE OF LAW PROCESS.
348	THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITY OF A CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, BASED ON FINNIS' NATURAL LAW THEORY. HIS CLAIM THAT LAW EXISTS IN DEGREES, BUT HAS A FOCAL MEANING, IS THE STARTING POINT TO THE RESEARCH. A CONTRADICTION REGARDING INCOMMENSURABILITY OF VALUES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOCAL MEANING OF LAW IS EMPHASIZED AND AN INTERPRETIVE TURN TO HIS THEORY PROPOSED. IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE UNDERSTOOD THROUGH HIS CONCEPT OF COMMON GOOD. IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE CONGRUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL LAWS WITH THE RULE OF LAW, SUPPLEMENTATION WITH THE DIALECTICAL METHOD OF AQUINAS IS PROPOSED. SUCH AN APPROACH ALSO ENABLES THE RESTATEMENT OF MODERN NATURAL LAW ON A THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION, WHICH IS, HOWEVER, MORE NUANCED THAN ITS OLDER NATURAL LAW COUNTERPARTS.
349	THE PUBLICATION PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS A COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT ANALYSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW: THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNMENT MUST BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A LEGAL BASIS FOR THEIR ACTIONS; LAWS SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF GUIDING PEOPLE'S CONDUCT SO THAT THEY CAN PLAN THEIR LIVES, KNOWING THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS; AND, AS A SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPT, THE RULE OF LAW MUST BE BASED ON RIGHTS, JUSTICE AND THE IDEAL OF ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT. IT ALSO DEVELOPS SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES AND PARTIALITY AS THE MAIN RISKS THAT THREATEN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. FINALLY, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXPLORED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF EUROPEAN LAW AND FOR MUTUAL TRUST BETWEEN MEMBER STATES.
350	BACKGROUND: THE RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS, ALONG WITH HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY DIGITALISATION TODAY. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR THE VICTORY OF POPULISM, THE MANIPULATION OF OPINIONS, ATTACKS ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDGES, AND THE GENERAL INSTRUMENTALISATION OF THE LAW CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ONSET OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RULE OF LAW. PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS ARE THE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES OF THE ALGORITHMISATION OF DECISION-MAKING, INCLUDING JUDICIAL DECISIONS.METHODS. THE THEORETICAL LINE OF THIS RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE AXIOLOGICAL METHOD SINCE THE RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT ONLY THE FOUNDATIONS OF LEGAL ORDER, BUT ALSO VALUES RECOGNISED IN MANY SOCIETIES AND SUPPORTED AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. THE STUDY ALSO RELIED ON THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD IN TERMS OF ASSESSING THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING INFLUENCED BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE. THE PRACTICAL LINE OF RESEARCH IS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF CASES OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE TO ILLUSTRATE THE CHANGES IN JURISPRUDENCE INFLUENCED BY DIGITALISATION.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE POTENTIAL WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW COULD BE RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES ITSELF, AND TO THEIR IMPACT ON CERTAIN VALUES AND FOUNDATIONS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY AGGRAVATED.JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS AFFECTED SINCE THE JUDGES ARE INVOLVED IN DIGITAL INTERACTIONS AND ARE INFLUENCED BY TECHNOLOGIES ALONG PERSONAL AND PUBLIC LINES. THAT TECHNOLOGIES OFTEN BELONG PRIVATE SECTOR BUT ARE PERCEIVED AS NEUTRAL AND INFALLIBLE, WHICH IS HIGHLY PREDICTIVE OF COURT DECISIONS. THIS LEADS TO A DISTORTION OF THE ESSENCE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND A SHIFT OF TRUST FROM THE COURTS TO CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR CREATORS.THE POSSIBILITY OF ALGORITHMIC DECISION-MAKING RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE RESULTS WILL BE FAIRER, OR AT LEAST AS FAIR, AS THOSE HANDED DOWN BY HUMAN JUDGES. THIS ENTAILS TWO PROBLEMS, THE FIRST OF WHICH IS RELATED TO THE TASK OF INTERPRETING THE LAW AND THE SECOND OF WHICH INVOLVES THE NEED TO EXPLAIN DECISIONS. ALGORITHMS, OFTEN PERCEIVED AS RELIABLE, ARE NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF INTERPRETING THE LAW, AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE PROPER EXPLANATIONS FOR DECISIONS OR UNDERSTAND CONTEXT AND SOCIAL PRACTICES IS QUESTIONABLE. EVEN PARTIAL RELIANCE ON ALGORITHMS SHOULD BE LIMITED, GIVEN THE GROWING INABILITY TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND ALGORITHMIC ROLES IN DECISION-MAKING AND DETERMINE WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISION AND TO WHAT EXTENT.
351	OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS EUROPEAN UNION (EU) LAW HAS EXPERIENCED A VERITABLE REVOLUTION TRIGGERED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE'S RETHINKING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS UNDERPINNING BOTH THE EU'S COMPETENCE TO DEAL WITH RULE OF LAW MATTERS (ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE IRREMOVABILITY OF JUDGES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL), AND THE SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW PERTAINING TO THE NEWLY-FOUND COMPETENCE. AN UPGRADED APPROACH TO INTERIM RELIEF IN MATTERS RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW COMPLETES THE PICTURE. AS A RESULT, EU LAW HAS GONE THROUGH A PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION AND THE ASSUMPTIONS AS TO THE PERCEIVED LIMITS OF ITS REACH - INSOFAR AS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL JUDICIARIES IS CONCERNED - NO LONGER HOLD. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THIS "RULE OF LAW REVOLUTION." WHILE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF BRINGING RECALCITRANT MEMBER STATES BACK ON TRACK HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN (AND POLAND AND HUNGARY STAND AS VALID REASONS FOR DOUBTS); THE DIVISION OF POWERS BETWEEN THE MEMBER STATES AND THE EU HAS BEEN ALTERED FOREVER. RULE OF LAW THUS EMERGES AS A SUCCESSFUL PRETEXT FOR A SUPRANATIONAL POWER-GRAB IN THE CONTEXT OF EU FEDERALISM. THE PICTURE IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION OF THE MEMBER STATES' JUDICIARIES ARE SEEMINGLY PERCEIVED AS INAPPLICABLE TO THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL ITSELF. THESE INCLUDE STRUCTURAL INDEPENDENCE FROM OTHER BRANCHES OF POWER AND SAFEGUARDS OF THE GUARANTEES OF IRREMOVABILITY AND SECURITY OF TENURE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARIES. TAKING ALL THESE ELEMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION APPEARS TO HAVE TRIGGERED AT LEAST AS MANY QUESTIONS AS IT HAS PROVIDED ANSWERS, WHILE BEING ENTIRELY UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS ON THE GROUND IN THE MEMBER STATES EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT BACKSLIDING IN THE AREAS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
352	THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE USE OF THE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS OF THE NEW MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. THE PURPOSE IS TO DISCOVER WHETHER PAST OR RECENT DECISIONS COULD CLARIFY THE USE OF THE PRINCIPLE IN THESE COUNTRIES. AN EXAMPLE IS THE LEGALISTIC CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW AS EXPRESSED BY THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS IN EXAMINING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LUSTRATION LAWS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS (SUCH AS THE CZECH ONE) HAVE USED A WIDER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. CONSIDERING THE SEVERE RULE-OF-LAW CRISIS WHICH HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN HUNGARY AND POLAND IN RECENT YEARS, THIS RECOGNITION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO AVOID CUMULATIVE JUDGMENTS THAT COULD DEVALUE THE FORMER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN GENERAL, TRIVIALIZING THE HARSH PATH OF DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONALITY WITH ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES.
353	THE WORLD AS A WHOLE HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GLOBAL DIMENSION AND HAS FLOURISHED WITH PROSPERITY. BUT STILL ONE CAN SEE THE HURDLES IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. ONE OF SUCH IMPEDIMENTS IS POVERTY AND THE OTHER IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. POVERTY RESULTS IN VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RULE OF LAW IS CRUCIAL AND IS ONE OF THE MEANS TO STRENGTHEN THESE HURDLES. ONE OF SUCH ESCALATION IS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT WHEREIN IT STRIVES FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ERADICATION OF POVERTY. THE RULE OF LAW PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN REDUCING EXTREME POVERTY WITH EMPHASIZING ON HUMAN RIGHTS. IT IS THE VERY ESSENCE AND THE CORE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. WITHOUT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ERADICATION OF POVERTY. THE RULE OF LAW STRENGTHENS TO PROVIDE INTENSE LEGAL FRAMEWORK. IT WORKS AS AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF LAW. INNOVATIVE METHODS ARE UNDERTAKEN TO AIM IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ERADICATION OF POVERTY. THE PAPER IMPLIES ON EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN PROVIDING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT POLICIES. IT ANALYSES THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN INDIA THAT CONTRIBUTES IN MAINTAINING ECONOMIC IMBALANCES. THE PAPER EXPLORES THE ROLE OF INDIAN JUDICIARY AND THE CLASSIC JUDGMENTS OF SUPREME COURT OF INDIA. KEEPING IN VIEW THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ERADICATION OF POVERTY, THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO EXPLORE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVE OF THE NATION. "DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY MEANS OF IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR LIVING, OR PROVIDING FOOD, WATER, SANITATION AND SHELTER, OF MAKING THE DESERTS GREEN AND THE MOUNTAINS HABITABLE" (INDIRA GANDHI, 1972).
354	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND VIRTUE ETHICS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE VIRTUE OF EMPATHY. IT DOES SO WITH THE HELP OF THE 2013 AND 2015 DECISIONS THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUED IN THE PERINCEK CASE. IN THESE DECISIONS, THE COURT CAME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO GENOCIDE DENIAL, DISPLAYING WHAT CAN ONLY BE DEEMED A SERIOUS LACK OF EMPATHY AND THEREWITH SUGGESTING THE RISK OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW LAPSING INTO BUREAUCRACY. THE ARTICLE FIRST SKETCHES THE RISK OF BUREAUCRATIZATION; THEREAFTER IT DISCUSSES HOW THE VIRTUES CAN BE CONNECTED TO THE LAW. THE SUBSEQUENT SECTIONS ARE DEVOTED TO AN ANALYSIS OF THE PERINCEK DECISIONS, FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF HOW EMPATHY ON THE PART OF THE COURT COULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE, AND COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE COURT FROM ENGAGING IN GENOCIDE DENIAL.
355	THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS SHOULD NOT INVOLVE OBTAINING THE TRUTH AT ANY PRICE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW MEXICO HAS ADOPTED EXCEPTIONAL REGULATIONS WHICH VIOLATE DUE PROCESS CONSIDERATIONS AND CREATE A PROBLEMATIC BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE ARGUE THAT, AT A TIME WHEN MEXICAN SOCIETY SUFFERS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ORGANIZED CRIME, THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES FOR TWO TYPES OF REGULATIONS: ONE PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS, WHICH ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW; AND ANOTHER WHICH INFRINGES ON THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS OF THOSE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PARTICIPATED IN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. WE EXAMINE MECHANISMS SUCH AS PREVENTIVE DETENTION AND PREVENTIVE IMPRISONMENT AND ANALYZE THEIR TREATMENT UNDER MEXICAN LAW AS WELL AS IN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS. WE EXPLORE WHETHER OR NOT THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIMINALITY AND THE PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS "BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY" IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THOSE SUSPECTED OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. WE CONCLUDE BY SUGGESTING THAT THE RESPONSE TO CRIMINALITY SHOULD NOT REQUIRE LIMITATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS.
356	THIS ARTICLE MAINLY COMPARES DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF POLITICAL STABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW ON CO2 EMISSIONS ACROSS 65 BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE COUNTRIES FROM 2000-2016. WE UTILIZE ACROSS LOW INCOME (LI), LOWER MIDDLE(LM), UPPER MIDDLE(UM) AND HIGH INCOME (HI)COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS POLITICAL STABILITY, CORRUPTION CONTROL AND RULE OF LAW ARE HIGHLY IMPORTANT IN LOWERING CARBON EMISSIONS AND IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. THE INTERACTING EFFECT BETWEEN POLITICAL STABILITY AND RULE OF LAW CAN REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) SHOWS A HETEROGENEOUS EFFECT ON CARBON EMISSIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT INCOME GROUPS, CONFIRMING "POLLUTION HAVEN" AND "POLLUTION HALO" HYPOTHESIS. TRADE OPENNESS REDUCES CO2 EMISSIONS IN LOW INCOME AND HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES, WHICH INCREASES CO2 EMISSIONS IN LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENHANCE THE ENFORCEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW TO DECREASE CO2 EMISSIONS. (C) 2020 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
357	THE AIM OF THIS WORK IS ANALYZING THE LEGAL RELEVANCE OF THE BICYCLE IN A SOCIAL RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS THE POOR AND UNFORTUNATE LEGAL ATTENTION THAT HAS BEEN PAID TO THIS MODE OF TRANSPORT. ITS SOCIAL ROLE HAS BEEN LIMITED, AT LEAST IN SPAIN, TO BEING A TOY AND A CASUAL INSTRUMENT OF LEISURE, COMBINED WITH THE POLITICAL FUNCTION OF EXTOLLING PATRIOTIC SPORTING ACHIEVEMENTS OF ILLUSTRIOUS CYCLISTS. UNTIL RECENTLY, THE BICYCLE SUFFERED A SOCIAL STIGMA AS A VEHICLE LINKED TO A STATUS OF POVERTY AND INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO BUY A CAR, OF INABILITY TO THRIVE. THIS SOCIAL CONTEMPT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN ITS LEGAL REGULATION, AS WILL BE SEEN LATER. IT SEEMS HOWEVER THAT SOMETHING IS CHANGING PRESENTLY, MAINLY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL.
358	IN FACE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONCENTRATED AND ABSTRACT CONTROL OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF LAWS, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE ROLE OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE EXERCISE OF THE LEGISLATIVE FUNCTION IS UNDENIABLE.THEREFORE, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAW IS NO LONGER AN EXCLUSIVE COMPETENCE OF THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES, THAT IS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE NATIONAL CONGRESS; SO THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT HAS BECOME A PARTIAL LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT PARTICIPATES CONCURRENTLY WITH THE EXPRESSION OF THE GENERAL WILL. IN THIS CONTEXT, HOWEVER, SOME CONSIDER A DEMOCRATIC RETURN TO EXTEND TO AN INSTITUTION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE NOT ELECTED THE POWER TO CANCEL A LAW FRUIT OF THE WILL OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE. OTHERS, ON THE CONTRARY, UNDERSTAND THAT THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT THE PEOPLE WANTED TO FIX IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT REPRESENTS A DEMOCRATIC ADVANCE. IN THIS PRESENT WORK, THEREFORE, IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE JURISDICTIONAL ASSURANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION GAVE RISE TO A NEW DEMOCRATIC REALITY THAT NO LONGER HAS TO BE INTERPRETED ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF DEMOCRACY. IT IS BASED ON THE CONCEPT OF REFLEXIVITY, COINED BY HISTORIAN PIERRE ROSANVALLON, WHO SEES THE CONTROL OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AS A WAY OF SHOWING THE PEOPLE IN THEIR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WITHIN A COMPLEX SOVEREIGNTY, THAT THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO ANALYZE THIS NEW DEMOCRATIC PARADIGM, IN WHICH LIVE TOGETHER ELECTORAL REPRESENTATION AND RULE OF LAW.
359	CONSTITUTIONALISM HAS POSED, FROM THE BEGINNING, A CLAIM FOR CONTROLLING THE POWER OF THE STATE, THROUGH THE FORMULATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, UNDERSTOOD AS A SET OF RULES THAT APPLY TO ALL THE INTEGRANTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GAME. HOWEVER, SUCH A PRETENSION CARRIES WITH IT, ALSO FROM THE BEGINNING, AN IRRESOLUBLE PROBLEM THAT APPEARS RECURRENTLY WITHIN THE HEART OF CONSTITUTIONALISM: THE NECESSITY OF UNIVERSALISM THAT, HOWEVER, CAN ONLY ASPIRE TO BE A PRECARIOUS GENERALITY, DUE TO THE PERMANENT PRESENCE OF THE EXCEPTION. THIS, INSTEAD, GIVES RISE TO A PERMANENT CYCLE OF TRANSGRESSION, WHICH WOULD POSE THE LAW IN THE SIDE OF SLAVERY RATHER THAN FREEDOM. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THIS PROBLEM BY REVIEWING NOT ONLY THE CLASSIC SOURCES BUT ALSO AND IMPORTANTLY BY ANALYZING THE THESIS OF CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS IN THIS RESPECT, SUCH AS BADIOU, ZIZEK AND AGAMBEN.
360	TRADITIONAL WISDOM IN ECONOMICS HOLDS THAT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE RUNS FROM POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS TO ECONOMIC ONES, WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF POLITICAL POWER AFFECTING THE CREATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW. THIS HIERARCHY OF INSTITUTIONS HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN MACROECONOMIC POLICY, WHERE IT HAS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE ARE POLITICAL INCENTIVES FOR ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT, NAMELY THE CREATION OF INFLATION. BUT ARE THERE LONGER-TERM EFFECTS OF CURRENCY MANIPULATION ON THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY? THAT IS, DOES THE HIERARCHY NOT ALWAYS HOLD? THIS PAPER ANSWERS THIS QUESTION BY FOCUSING ON A SPECIFIC CASE OF MONETARY INSTABILITY, THE NEWLY-INDEPENDENT SECOND POLISH REPUBLIC OF 1918 TO 1939. USING APPROPRIATE ECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES ON A NEW DATABASE OF HISTORICAL DATA, I FIND THAT MONETARY PROFLIGACY CORRELATES STRONGLY WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RESULT IS ROBUST TO SEVERAL TESTS AND MOST SPECIFICATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF A NEW VARIABLE FOR MEASURING ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MONETARY INSTABILITY IS A THREAT TO POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS IN ITS OWN RIGHT, ERODING THE RULE OF LAW IN ADDITION TO CREATING MACROECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. (C) 2018 THE AUTHOR.

361	THIS ARTICLE PUTS FOR WARD SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND IMPLICATIONS THAT THE EXPRESSION 'RULE OF LAW' PRESENTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, MAKING A SPECIAL EMPHASIS IN ITS DEFINITION, ITS SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND THE DIMENSION THAT SAID EXPRESSION ACQUIRES IN PRACTICE. IN THIS RE SPECT, AN APPROACH IS MADE TO TACKLE THIS SUBJECT ON THE DILEMMA IT POSES BE TWEEN LEGALITY AND LEGITIMACY AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS IN IT; IT ANALYZES, IN PARTICULAR, THE ROLE OF BOTH THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE IN THE CREATION AND IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
362	MAX WEBER HAS HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE UPON THE ENQUIRY INTO CIVILISATIONS AND THEIR DIFFERENCES. BOOKS AND ARTICLES KEEP COMING OUT ON WESTERN RATIONALITY AND THE OCCIDENTAL FORM OF CAPITALISM, WHAT HE CALLED MODERN CAPITALISM. BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE 1904, WHEN HE STARTED PUBLISHING ON WORLD RELIGIONS AND THEIR SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PREVAILING ECONOMIC ETHICS OF PERSONAL CONDUCT. HIS FAVOURITE, PROTESTANTISM, IS BARELY SURVIVING IN EUROPE, ALTHOUGH STILL FLOURISHING IN THE US AND BRAZIL. AND MODERN CAPITALISM HAS MOVED TO EAST AND SOUTH EAST ASIA, THE RELIGION OF BUDDHISM IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS WITH LOCAL RELIGIONS. ARE THERE THEN NO OTHER CIVILIZATIONAL DIVIDE THAN WEBER'S CANDIDATES: RELIGION AND CAPITALISM? YES, THERE IS A MORE POWERFUL SEPARATION AMONG THE WORLD'S CIVILISATIONS THAT IS BEING EXPERIENCED DAILY BY GLOBAL INHABITANTS, NAMELY THE RULE OF LAW (RL).
363	THIS ARTICLE FIRST OFFERS AN OVERVIEW OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK, WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN MARCH 2014. THE MECHANISM'S POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS AND THE COMMISSION'S REASONING TO JUSTIFY ITS FIRST ACTIVATION AGAINST POLAND IN JANUARY 2016, WHEN IT HAS FAILED TO DO SO AGAINST HUNGARY, ARE SUBSEQUENTLY ANALYZED. WHILE THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR SEEKING TO ADDRESS INCREASING RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING AT MEMBER STATE LEVEL, OUR MAIN SUBMISSION IS THAT RELIANCE ON THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK ALONE, IF ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS SOFT AND DISCURSIVE NATURE, WILL NOT REMEDY A SITUATION WHERE SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS OF EU VALUES FORM PART OF A GOVERNMENTAL PLAN TO SET UP AN 'ILLIBERAL' REGIME.
364	THE NORMS GOVERNING EU SOVEREIGN DEBT CONDITIONALITY IN 'DEBTOR STATES' SIGNIFICANTLY TROUBLE THE RULE OF LAW. MY ANALYSIS ADDRESSES THIS CENTRAL, YET TO DATE IGNORED, RULE OF LAW CHALLENGE CREATED BY THE EU ECONOMIC CRISIS. I CONTRAST MY SPECIFIC APPROACH WITH TWO OTHER RULE OF LAW STRANDS IN CURRENT EU SCHOLARSHIP AND DEVELOP IT BY PLACING IT WITHIN RELEVANT BROADER LITERATURES ON RULE OF LAW AND EMERGENCY. DRAWING PARTICULARLY ON FULLER AND WALDRON, THIS PRODUCES A FORMAL AND PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW CRITIQUE EMBRACING BOTH ATTRIBUTES OF THE NORMS THEMSELVES AND CHALLENGES TO THOSE NORMS BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE AND THE EUROPEAN OMBUDSMAN. THE MANAGERIALISM MANIFESTED IN BAILOUT GOVERNANCE DEPARTS FROM THE FOUNDATIONAL COMMITMENTS INHERENT IN BOTH LAW AND NEW GOVERNANCE.
365	IN THIS LARGELY INSTRUMENTAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENT I MAKE THE CASE FOR EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL OF ARTICLE 259 TFEU, ALLOWING FOR DIRECT ACTIONS BROUGHT BY THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AGAINST OTHER MEMBER STATES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES DEVIATING FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF ARTICLE 2 TEU. DEPLOYING THIS PROPOSAL WILL IMPLY CHANGING THE ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF (NON-) APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 259 TFEU. SUCH A CHANGE, WHILE NOT DEPARTING FROM THE LETTER OR THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW, HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES, FROM NOT GETTING THE COMMISSION DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE ACTION ABOUT THE VALUES OF ARTICLE 2 TEU (SHOULD IT WISH TO KEEP ON STAYING AWAY), TO AVOIDING THE UNHELPFUL CONSTRUCTION OF ARTICLE 258 TFEU, WHICH HAS BEEN INTERPRETED TOO CAUTIOUSLY AND EMERGED AS UNHELPFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENTIRELY UNUSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. CHANGE SHOULD START SOMEWHERE AND THE MEMBER STATES, USING ARTICLE 259 TFEU POTENTIALLY COULD TAKE THE LEAD. IN MAKING THE PLEA FOR PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO HORIZONTAL ENFORCEMENT OF VALUES AMONG THE MEMBER STATES (ALBEIT VIA THE COURT OF JUSTICE) THIS CONTRIBUTION DRAWS ON THE HELPFUL ANALYSIS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF BUNDLING EVIDENCE OF MEMBER STATE DISREGARD OF THE RULE OF LAW TO START 'SYSTEMIC INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS' BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE. THIS TECHNIQUE, PROPOSED BY KIM LANE SCHEPPELE, COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE PROMISE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE VERY BASICS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2 TEU.
366	THE FAILURE OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEORISTS, RESEARCHERS, REFORMERS, AND PRACTITIONERS TO MAKE THE RULE OF LAW THE FOUNDATION OF U.S. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN EROSION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND LEGALITY IN THE NATIONAL ADMINISTRATION. PROMINENT CONTEMPORARY THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW INCLUDE STANDARDLESS DELEGATIONS OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, THE CHEVRON DOCTRINE AND RELATED JUDICIAL DEFERENCE, THE USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS IN PLACE OF RULES, PRESIDENTIAL LEGISLATION BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, AGGRANDIZEMENT THROUGH UNITARY EXECUTIVE BRANCH THEORY, AND POLICYMAKING BY CONCERTED NONENFORCEMENT OF STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. TOGETHER, THESE THREATS CONTRIBUTE TO MASSIVE CONSTITUTIONAL DISTORTION. THIS RAISES QUESTIONS OF WHETHER IT IS TIME FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION THEORISTS, RESEARCHERS, AND PRACTITIONERS TO CONSIDER A 'RULE OF LAW RESTORATION' INITIATIVE IN THE U.S. AND USE THE AMERICAN CASE EXAMINED HERE AS A POTENTIAL BASIS FOR CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTEMPORARY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WORLDWIDE.
367	THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT JUST A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR A MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETY BUT ALSO AN IMPORTANT PREREQUISITE FOR A STABLE, EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE MARKET ECONOMY. HOWEVER, RELEVANT LEGAL NORMS MAY BE MORE OR LESS SUCCESSFUL DEPENDING ON THEIR SOCIAL RECEPTION WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF HOW IT IS VIEWED SOCIALLY, AND THE FUNCTIONING OF MARKET ECONOMY IN THE EXAMPLES OF TWO GEOGRAPHICALLY CONTIGUOUS YET OFTEN-DIVERGING COUNTRIES, NAMELY GERMANY AND POLAND. WE UTILISE TWO APPROACHES TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE, FIRST STUDYING SOCIETAL PERCEPTIONS OF THE VARIOUS DIMENSIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY WAY OF STANDARDIZED SURVEYS AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED IN BOTH COUNTRIES TO DETERMINE THE DE FACTO STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT. SECONDLY, WE MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THE DE JURE AND DE FACTO RULE OF LAW ON ECONOMIC OUTCOMES USING A MULTIVARIATE PANEL ANALYSIS. COMBINING NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY OF LAW, OUR ANALYSIS FINDS THAT POLISH FIRMS PERCEIVE THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS EXECUTION BY THE STATE IN A RESTRICTIVE PERSPECTIVE, CONTRIBUTING TO INSECURITY. GERMAN INTERVIEWEES, HOWEVER, SHOWCASE THE SUPPORTIVE AND TRANSACTION COST-REDUCING PROPERTIES OF THE RULE OF LAW, DISPLAYING HIGHER TRUST IN THE STATE. THESE FINDINGS ARE SUPPORTED BY AN ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE DRIVERS OF RULE OF LAW IN BOTH POLAND AND GERMANY, WHICH SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER LEVELS OF INVESTMENT.
368	SOME SAY THAT THE UNION IS BUILT BY MOVING FROM CRISIS TO CRISIS. CRISES IN THE LAST DECADE WHICH AFFECTED THE UNION AND ITS CITIZENS CONCERNED, INTER ALIA, PUBLIC FINANCE (THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, 2008), MIGRATION (2014), PUBLIC HEALTH (THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, 2020) AND THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS (2018). THIS PAPER FOCUS ON THE LATTER. IT HAS BEEN NOTED THAT SOME MEMBER STATES HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF EU MEMBERSHIP, SPECIFICALLY THE FINANCIAL ONES, WHILE THEIR COMMITMENT TO EUROPEAN VALUES, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW (ARTICLE 2 TEU), HAS BEEN LACKING. SINCE MANY INSTRUMENTS APPLIED BY EU INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION HAVE PROVED RATHER INSUFFICIENT, HALTING TRANSFERS OF EU FUNDS TO THESE RECALCITRANT MEMBER STATES HAS BEEN TOUTED AS THE WAY THAT MIGHT SOLVE THIS CRISIS. ACCORDINGLY, A DRAFT REGULATION WAS PUT ON THE TABLE THAT AUTHORISED THE EU INSTITUTIONS TO SUSPEND EU FUNDS IF A MEMBER STATE IS FOUND TO BE IN BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS DRAFT AIMED TO MAKE THE TRANSFER OF EU FUNDS TO THE MEMBER STATES CONDITIONAL UPON THEIR CONTINUOUS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW (AND THEREFORE BECAME KNOWN AS 'THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY'). THIS PAPER COMMENTS ON THIS DRAFT AS FIRST PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION IN 2018 (PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL ON THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION BUDGET IN THE EVENT OF GENERALIZED GAPS IN THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES [COM (2018) 324 FINAL).], AMENDED IN 2019 BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT [EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION OF 4 APRIL 2019 ON THE PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL ON THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION'S BUDGET IN CASE OF GENERALISED DEFICIENCIES AS REGARDS THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES (COM(2018)0324-C8-0178/2018-2018/0136(COD)); . A DRAFT VERSION OF THESE PROVISIONS WAS PRESENTED IN VON BOGDANDY AND LACNY (SUSPENSION OF EU FUNDS FOR BREACHING THE RULE OF LAW - MU A DOSE OF TOUGH LOVE NEEDED? EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS 2020, NO 2, P. 1-15, , 2020).], AND FINALLY ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL AS REGULATION (EU, EURATOM) 2020/2092 OF 16 DECEMBER 2020 ON A GENERAL REGIME OF CONDITIONALITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION BUDGET [HUNGARY AND POLAND VOTED AGAINST IT AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT ITS VALIDITY WILL BE CHALLENGED BEFORE THE CJEU VIA AN ACTION FOR ANNULMENT (ARTICLE 263 TFEU).] (HENCEFORTH CALLED 'REGULATION 2020/2092 '). THIS REGULATION, CONTAINING 29 RECITALS IN THE PREAMBLE AND 10 ARTICLES, ENTERED INTO FORCE ON 1 JANUARY 2021 (ARTICLE 10 REGULATION 2020/2092.). IN THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEETING IN DECEMBER 2020 IT WAS HOWEVER ACCEPTED THAT IT WILL BE APPLIED ONLY IN RELATION TO BUDGETARY COMMITMENTS STARTING UNDER THE NEW MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK (MFF) 2021-2027, INCLUDING NEXT GENERATION EU [CONCLUSIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL MEETING, 10 AND 11 DECEMBER 2020, PARA I (2) (K) .]. THIS PAPER PROVIDES THE LEGAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY ESTABLISHED UNDER REGULATION 2020/2092 AND AIMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES CAN RESTORE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN MEMBER STATES. OR IN OTHER WORDS, IS IT ALL ABOUT THE MONEY?
369	THIS STUDY BUILDS ON PRIOR CROSS-NATIONAL CRIMINOLOGICAL LITERATURE BY USING DISAGGREGATED MEASURES OF DEMOCRACY, NOTABLY RULE OF LAW, TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE KEY COMPONENTS OF DEMOCRACY HAVE ON HOMICIDE RATES. TO ASSESS THIS RELATIONSHIP, THE CURRENT STUDY USES TWO MEASURES OF RULE OF LAW: (A) A MEASUREMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY; (B) A MEASUREMENT OF LAW AND ORDER TRADITION FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY RISK GUIDE (ICRG). FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE MEASURES OF RULE OF LAW HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON HOMICIDE RATES.
370	SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROTESTS IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE INCREASINGLY VIOLENT WITH CITIZENS DEMANDING THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED RIGHTS WHILST IGNORING THE RULE OF LAW. THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW HOLDS SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH AFRICA. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE RULE OF LAW, SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND VIOLENT PROTEST IN SOUTH AFRICA. THE REALISATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS, THE REASONS FOR VIOLENT PROTEST AND THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE INVESTIGATED. TWO CONVENTIONAL METHODOLOGIES FOR STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW, THE INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH AND THE NEOCULTURAL INTERVENTIONIST APPROACH, ARE EXPLORED. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT VIOLENT CITIZEN PROTEST HIGHLIGHTS THE URGENT NEED FOR REFORM TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH AFRICA. SUCH REFORM CAN BE FOUND IN THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE REALISATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS FORM PART OF THE SUBSTANTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT ALLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED AND PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW; FOCUSING ON PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY END USERS OF THE LAW SYSTEM. A PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH TO STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW ALLOWS THE COURTS, LEGAL SCHOLARS AND LEGAL PRACTITIONERS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES TO REALISE SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND THEREBY FULFILLING THE SUBSTANTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
371	THE ARTICLES GATHERED HERE PROVIDE A RANGE OF APPROACHES, BUT THERE ARE SOME TOPICS THAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE A FULLER PICTURE. THESE TOPICS INCLUDE: A CHINESE MARXIST APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS; SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW, WHICH FRAMES THE REVISED (2018) REGULATION ON RELIGION; THE LARGEST PROTESTANT CHURCH ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD, THE THREE-SELF PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT; AND THE 2018 CHINESE-VATICAN AGREEMENT. THE FOLLOWING IS PREDICATED ON THE NEED FOR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FULL PICTURE, UPON WHICH ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE BASED.
372	THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MODERN SOCIETY AS A CORE VALUE IN DOMESTIC POLITICAL GOVERNANCE. IT EVOLVES FROM SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY AND IS MEANT TO REIN IN THE ALMIGHTY AND POWERS FROM ITS BEGINNING AND LATER APPLIES TO ALL. IN GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS BECOME AN ESSENTIAL PILLAR OF THE PRESENT INTERNATIONAL ORDER. THE RECENT RISE OF UNILATERAL ACTIONS HAS POSED THREAT TO THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW TRADITION. EQUALITY IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, PACTA SUNT SERVANDA, AND GOOD FAITH IMPLEMENTATION OF TREATY OBLIGATIONS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, WHICH PROVIDES PREDICTABILITY AND STABILITY TO THE STAKE HOLDERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE FUNDAMENTAL COMMON VALUES OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION. UPHOLDING THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW GOES TO THE FUNDAMENTALS AND NATURES OF HUMAN BEINGS. THUS, MAINTAINING INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS A GUARANTEE FOR A BETTER WORLD FOR ALL.
373	CHINA HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW (ROL) REGARDING LAND AND RESOURCES WHICH LED TO A SERIES OF REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS. THE LEGAL SYSTEM REGARDING LAND AND RESOURCES IS NOW BASICALLY COMPLETE. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROL REGARDING STATE LAND ADMINISTRATION IS STILL FAR FROM MEETING PRACTICAL NEEDS. THE REMOVAL OF THESE SHORTCOMINGS REQUIRES A SCIENTIFIC, SYSTEMATIC AND QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF THE STATE OF THE ROL REGARDING LAND AND RESOURCES. TO IMPROVE LEGAL OVERSIGHT IN LAND ADMINISTRATION, THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF A RULE OF LAW INDEX (ROLI) FOR THE EVALUATION OF STATE LAND ADMINISTRATION, WHICH PROVIDES A THEORETICAL BASIS AND METHODOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR THE SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE ROL REGARDING LAND AND RESOURCES BY THE MINISTRY OF LAND AND RESOURCES. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ROL REGARDING STATE LAND ADMINISTRATION IS OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE PROMOTION OF LEGAL OVERSIGHT IN THE COURSE OF URBANIZATION IN MODERN CHINA AND WORLDWIDE.
374	THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF LAW FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING A 'HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT' AND DETERRING 'UNWANTED MIGRATION' IS PARTICULARLY VISIBLE IN THE UK. THE NEW NATIONALITY AND BORDERS ACT 2022 CONTAINS PROPOSALS ON ASYLUM WHICH SHOW A REJECTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW NORMS AND CONVENTIONS, WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO PUT THAT REJECTION SQUARELY TO THE PUBLIC. THAT IS NOT NEW. RIGHT FROM THE EMERGENCE OF ASYLUM AS A POLITICAL ISSUE IN THE 1980'S, THE LUKEWARM OFFICIAL 'WELCOME' NEVER QUITE HID THE STANCE OF DISBELIEF WHICH UNDERLAY THE UK'S LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL RESPONSES. A PARALLEL PROCESS, BEGINNING EVEN EARLIER BUT ACCELERATING FROM 2010 ONWARDS, HAS TAKEN PLACE IN UK DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAW. NEW LEGISLATION, IMMIGRATION RULES, POLICIES, APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND LITIGATION PRACTICES SHOW DIMINISHING RESPECT FOR RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES. THIS ARTICLE USES SIMPLE AND HOPEFULLY UNCONTROVERSIAL DEFINITIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW NORMS AND ACCEPTED COMMON LAW RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES AGAINST WHICH TO ANALYSE AND CRITIQUE KEY ASPECTS OF UK IMMIGRATION CONTROL. IT CONCLUDES THAT UK POLICIES AND PRACTICE HAVE OVER TIME DISPLAYED AN INCREASING HOSTILITY TO THOSE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES, RESORTING TO IGNORANT AND EVEN BRAZEN INDIFFERENCE TO FACTS, EVIDENCE, AND ANALYSIS, AND WIDENING THE GAP BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IN IMPORTANT RESPECTS.
375	INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT (ISDS) CASES HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT DECADES, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTES CONSTITUTE THE CORE OF THE MODERN INVESTMENT REGIME. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SEEK TO EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN THE HOST GOVERNMENTS' RISK OF BEING CHALLENGED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS BEFORE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION TRIBUNALS. WE ARGUE THAT SUCH RISK IS GREATEST AT THE INTERMEDIATE LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY WHERE SOME DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS SUCH AS ELECTIONS ARE STRONG, BUT THE SYSTEM OF RULE OF LAW REMAINS WEAK. IN THOSE REGIMES, REGULATORY RISK RUNS HIGHER THAN IN AUTOCRATIC REGIMES AS THE HOST GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDER GREATER PRESSURE FOR REGULATING MATTERS OF BROAD PUBLIC CONCERN. AT THE SAME TIME, MORE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL RISK OF ARBITRARY, DISCRIMINATE, AND ABUSIVE ACTS REMAINS CONSIDERABLE AT THAT LEVEL OF DEMOCRACY DUE TO WEAK RULE OF LAW, EXACERBATING THE FORMER RISK. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDES A GOOD DEAL OF SUPPORT FOR THE ARGUMENT.
376	THE LEGAL PROGRESSION IN CHINA IS PORTRAYED NEGATIVELY BY WESTERN SCHOLARS WHO OFTEN ARGUE THAT THE STATE INSTITUTIONS IN CHINA ARE SUBORDINATE TO THE CONTROL OF CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY'S LEADERSHIP WHICH MAKES THESE INSTITUTIONS POLITICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. WE CONSIDER THAT THE LEGAL PROGRESSION IN CHINA HAS AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING "HARMONIOUS SOCIALIST SOCIETY."THE PURPOSE OF THIS THESIS IS TO PROVIDE AN ANALYTICAL LITERATURE REVIEW OF SCHOLASTIC WORK TO EXPLAIN THE LEGALITY OF RULE OF LAW IN CHINA AND TO ELABORATE THE OUTCOMES OF CHINA'S RECENT LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS. THIS PAPER HAS TWO MAIN SUBJECTS. FIRST, IT EXAMINES THE NATURE OF LAW AND RULE OF LAW IN CHINA THROUGH THE PRISM OF DIFFERENT LEGAL THEORIES. SECONDLY, BY ARGUING FROM DIFFERENT POLITICAL THEORIES, IT EXPLAINS THE NECESSITY OF CUSTOMIZED LEGAL SYSTEM IN CHINA FOR ESTABLISHING A HARMONIOUS SOCIALIST SOCIETY. BY GIVING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES FROM CONTEMPORARY CHINA, THIS THESIS ARGUES THAT THE LEGALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESSION RATHER THAN THE WESTERN LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. CHINA'S ECONOMIC PROGRESS DEMANDS A CUSTOMIZED LEGAL SYSTEM. IN OUR THESIS, WE CLAIM THAT THE REGULAR UPGRADATION OF LAWS AND INTRODUCTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS IN CHINA, SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION. LEGAL PROGRESSION IN CHINA DURING LAST DECADE PERFECTLY FIT INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF "SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS" AND IS VERY CRUCIAL FOR BUILDING A HARMONIOUS SOCIALIST SOCIETY. IT IS VIVID FROM CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPED INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. FINALLY, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS THAT THE CHINESE LEGAL PROGRESSION CAN BE TAKEN AS SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLE OF LEGAL EXPERIMENTALISM.
377	ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS CONSOLIDATED THE AIM OF REFORMING ITS SOCIETY TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW, THE CHINESE VERSION OF THE RULE OF LAW DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ITS COUNTERPARTS IN THE WESTERN TRADITION. INCREASING ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THE CHINESE CONCEPTION AS CHINA STRIVES TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE THROUGH LAUNCHING THE 'BELT AND ROAD' INITIATIVE (BRI). THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND BY WHAT MEANS VARIOUS BRI PROJECTS ARE IMPACTED BY AND IMPACT UPON THE CHINESE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE UNIQUENESS OF THE CHINESE APPROACH CAN BE EXAMINED FROM THREE DIMENSIONS: THE ONTOLOGICAL DIMENSION, DESCRIBING THE PREFERENCE FOR INTEGRATION OVER CONVERGENCE IN THE GOVERNANCE MODELS OF ECONOMIES; THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL DIMENSION, IN WHICH A POSTERIORI JUSTIFICATIONS PREVAIL OVER A PRIORI ONES; AND THE METHODOLOGICAL DIMENSION, IN WHICH THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SPHERES OVERSHADOWS THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THEM. FOLLOWING THIS, THE PAPER PROFILES THE PRACTICES OF BRI INVESTMENT AND ASSESSES WHETHER THESE PRACTICES PRESENT CONSISTENTLY WITH THE CHINESE CONCEPTION. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINED THE STRONG NEEDS OFTEN EMBEDDED WITHIN BRI PROJECTS THAT CALL FOR SUSTAINABLE COOPERATION, MARKET-GENERATING GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION, AS WELL AS THE COORDINATION OF VARIOUS SOCIAL INTERESTS. ALL THESE FACTORS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PECULIARITY OF THE CHINESE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE BRI IS HIGHLY CONSISTENT WITH THE CHINESE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND MAY HELP FURTHER ENHANCE IT. THIS CONCLUSION FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT THE DISTINCTIVE CONCEPTION IS NOT SOLELY THE RESULT OF IDEOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL FACTORS BUT ALSO OF THE UNIQUE DEMANDS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF ECONOMIC UNDERTAKINGS.
378	THIS TEXT SEEKS TO RELATE THE JUDICIALIZATION OF LIFE - CIVIL SOCIETY'S DIVERSE DEMANDS DIRECTED TO THE COURT SYSTEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND RIGHTS CLAIMS - TO A CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIARY BRANCHES. THE TEXT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION PRESENTS A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE ISSUE DISCUSSED THROUGH A FOUCAULTIAN METHODOLOGICAL VIEW, WHICH CONTEMPLATES AN ARCHEOLOGY OF JUDICIALIZATION BASED ON THE RESCUE OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT. THE SECOND SECTION DIRECTS THE ARGUMENT TOWARDS SCHOOLS, SEEKING TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE SCHOOL CONFLICTS THAT ARE JUDICIALIZED AND PRESENTING A CRITICAL VIEW ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF JUDICIALIZATION FOR THE DAILY SCHOOL LIFE. IT IS ABOUT DISCUSSING HOW SCHOOL ROUTINE IS AFFECTED WHEN THE LEGAL SYSTEM RATIONALE BREAKS INTO THE SCHOOL, AND WHAT CRITERIA ARE LISTED BY THE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT FOR RESORTING TO LEGAL INSTANCES AND / OR THE CHILD PROTECTIVE COUNCIL WITH A JUDICIALIZING GOAL.
379	THIS RESEARCH REVIEWS THE INSTITUTION OF AMPARO WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, IN THE CIVIL LAW CULTURE. IT DEFENDS THE THESIS THAT THE PROCEDURAL INSTITUTION OF AMPARO IS NOT THEORETICALLY NECESSARY -IN A LOGICAL SENSE- FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW; THE REASONS TO JUSTIFY ITS IMPLEMENTATION ARE THEN OF A PRACTICAL NATURE. IT IS ALSO ARGUED THAT, BASED ON LEGAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AND TAKING THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS SERIOUSLY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO STIPULATE A GENERAL CONCEPTION OF AMPARO AND TO INFER AN OPTIMAL MODEL. THIS MODEL IS ADJUSTED TO THE PROPERTIES OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW, HARMONIZING THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT EUROPEAN AND LATIN AMERICAN MODELS AND DILUTES ITS PROBLEMS. THE COUNTRIES THAT DECIDE TO IMPLEMENT OR MAINTAIN (WITH ADJUSTMENTS) THE PROCEDURAL INSTITUTION OF AMPARO OUGHT TO KEEP IN MIND THIS OPTIMAL MODEL.
380	TO REINSTATE WHAT AMOUNTS TO A "SOVIET-STYLE JUSTICE SYSTEM", POLISH AUTHORITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY AND DELIBERATELY VIOLATED THE POLISH CONSTITUTION AND EU LAW. RATHER THAN COMPREHENSIVELY DETAILING THESE REPEATED VIOLATIONS, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE EU DIMENSION OF POLAND'S RULE OF LAW BREAKDOWN. USING THE ACTIVATION OF THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON 13 JANUARY 2016 AS A STARTING POINT, THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A CRITICAL FIVE-YEAR ASSESSMENT OF EU'S (IN)ACTION STARTING WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTIPLE PROBLEMATICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED EARLY ON BY THE COMMISSION HAVE YET TO BE ADDRESSED BY POLISH AUTHORITIES BY JANUARY 2021. REGARDING THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL'S (IN)ACTION, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE COMMISSION HAS SYSTEMATICALLY ACTED IN A TOO LITTLE TOO LATE FASHION WHILE THE COUNCIL HAS SYSTEMATICALLY FAILED TO MEANINGFULLY ACT, WITH THE INACTION OF THESE TWO EU INSTITUTIONS AMOUNTING, AT TIMES, TO DERELICTION OF DUTIES. BY CONTRAST, THE COURT OF JUSTICE HAS FORCEFULLY DEFENDED JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE WHENEVER AN INFRINGEMENT CASE WAS LODGED WITH IT BY THE COMMISSION. THE COURT OF JUSTICE'S RECORD IN PRELIMINARY RULING CASES IS MORE MIXED DUE, IN PART, TO THE COURT'S APPREHENSION TO UNDERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL TRUST. THE ARTICLE ENDS WITH A LIST OF KEY LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH REFLECT THE EU'S FEW SUCCESSES AND MANY FAILURES HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS ARTICLE. IT IS SUBMITTED INTER ALIA THAT MORE STATEMENTS, DIALOGUE AND REPORTS ARE NOT GOING TO HELP CONTAIN, LET ALONE SOLVE POLAND'S RULE OF LAW CRISIS. IT IS INDEED NO LONGER A CRISIS THE EU IS FACING BUT A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND WHICH, IN TURN, REPRESENTS A THREAT TO THE INTERCONNECTED LEGAL ORDER THAT UNDERPINS THE EU.
381	CAN THE REFLECTION OF LEGAL SCHOLARS CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW BE ENRICHED BY THE CULTURAL CONCEPTION OF FREUD ABOUT LAW? THIS ARTICLE DEVELOPS THIS QUESTION, BASED ON HOW THE RULE OF LAW WAS CONCEIVED IN MODERNITY, FROM A READING OF THE WORK OF HUME AND ROUSSEAU, IN ORDER TO SHOW THE POTENTIAL COMPATIBILITY THAT THIS CONCEPTION HAD WITH THE LATER WORK OF FREUD. THUS, FREUD'S THINKING ABOUT LAW IS PRESENTED AS A DIALECTICAL OR PARADOXICAL CIVILIZATORY FORCE, RESTRAINING THE PASSIONS EVEN THOUGH THEY DRIVE IT, FROM A READING OF HIS WORK TOTEM AND TABOO. IN THIS RECONSTRUCTION, THE GENEALOGY OF LAW IS PORTRAYED, FROM HIS STORY OF THE PRIMAL HORDE, AND UNCONSCIOUS DYNAMICS BEHIND THE LAW ITSELF. THEN THE USES THAT VARIOUS LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE MADE OF FREUD IN WRITING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW ARE ANALYZED, CRITICIZING HOW THEY NEGLECT THE TRAGIC SENTIMENT OF THE FREUDIAN CULTURAL VISION REGARDING LAW. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE STATES THAT THE NOTIONS DEVELOPED BY FREUD CAN SERVE CRITICAL LEGAL THINKING ONLY IF THE LAW IS SEEN AS PART OF THE CULTURE, WHICH LEADS TO CONSIDER LEGAL STUDIES AS A FORM OF CULTURAL STUDIES.
382	IN HIS ESSAY, FRANCIS FUKUYAMA OFFERS A VISION OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE THAT I CONTEND IS FLAWED IN AT LEAST THREE IMPORTANT RESPECTS: THE BASIC FRAMEWORK OF HIS THREE PILLARS (AND IN PARTICULAR, HIS CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW), HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM, AND HIS ASSUMPTION OF THE STRENGTH (AND EVEN AGILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS) OF CHINA'S BUREAUCRATIC STATE STRUCTURE. AFTER EXAMINING HIS ARGUMENTS, I OUTLINE A DIFFERENT FRAMEWORK, DRAWN FROM MY CURRENT RESEARCH, WHICH I CALL LEGAL REGIMES AND EXPLAIN HOW IT CAN BE APPLIED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEMPORARY REALITIES OF CHINA'S LEGAL SYSTEM. I ALSO DRAW ON MY RECENT FINDINGS TO CHALLENGE ANY ASSUMPTIONS OF STATE STRENGTH OR RESILIENCE, BEFORE EXAMINING THE IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRENT CHINESE POLITICS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE TRAJECTORIES.
383	THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CENTRAL MILESTONE OF MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATES. THERE IS A GAP, HOWEVER, BETWEEN WHAT IS ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXTS AND THE LIVED-IN WORLD. THE SCHOLARS USE TO CONCENTRATE THEIR FOCUS ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S ROLE (AND, SOMETIMES, OF LEGISLATIVE POWER) IN SITUATIONS OF DISREGARD OF THE CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, WE CHOSE TO TARGET THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND ITS DECISIONS AS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE PRODUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC DECAY. WE CLAIM THAT THE JUDICIARY STARTED TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THIS PROCESS BY ASSUMING A POPULIST BIAS AND CARRYING OUT COMMON LAW-FARE PRACTICES - WHICH CAN BE WELL EXEMPLIFIED BY JUDICIAL ELECTORAL DECISIONS AND THE JUDICIAL DECISIONS ABOUT OPERATION CAR WASH. FOR RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM AND DISCUSSING THE HYPOTHESIS, WE USED THE THEORETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHOD. WE CARRIED OUT A LITERATURE REVIEW. WE ALSO USE INFORMATIVE DOCUMENTARIES EXTRACTED FROM THE MEDIA ON THE BEHAVIOR OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND THE CRITICAL DESCRIPTION OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS. THE BIBLIOGRAPHY IS INTERDISCIPLINARY. WE CONCLUDE THAT WHEN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BECOMES A POLITICAL ACTOR, IT FOSTERS A SITUATION OF INSTABILITY AND BECOMES AN INSTITUTION WHOSE LEGITIMACY DEPENDS ON VARIATIONS IN THE MOOD OF SOCIETY - WHICH GOES AGAINST THE ASSUMPTIONS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS NEW JUDICIAL BEHAVIOR CAUSES AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE POWERS AND THE ABSENCE OF AN INSTITUTION THAT MODERATES SOCIAL CONFLICTS. THIS SITUATION CONTRIBUTED TO THE RESURGENCE OF THE AUTHORITARIAN IDENTITY OF BRAZILIAN CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE IDEOLOGICAL POLARIZATION THAT CULMINATED IN THE ELECTION OF A FAR-RIGHT ADMINISTRATION IN 2018.
384	THE PROMOTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CARBON NEUTRALITY AGAINST PEAKING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS URGENTLY NEED THE SUPPORT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND THE BACKING PROVIDED BY A GUARANTEE OF RULE OF LAW. THE PROPOSITION, LOGIC, AND PROGRESSION OF DIGITAL RESPONSES TO PEAKING CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE SEARCH FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY ARE CLEARLY REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT ERA, EMPLOYING BIG DATA TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF INADEQUATE CENTRAL-LOCAL COORDINATION AND INTERACTION, THE INADEQUATE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW, CAMPAIGN-STYLE "CARBON REDUCTION" PROMOTION, AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT IN THE PROMOTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PEAK CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY. WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE COORDINATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, THE RULE OF LAW RESPONSE, AND THE PROTECTION OF PEOPLE'S RIGHTS. FIRST, IN THE PROCESS OF DIGITAL CARBON DIOXIDE PEAKING AND CARBON NEUTRALITY, IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE CREDIBILITY OF CARBON DIOXIDE PEAKING AND CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH THE "WHOLE-PROCESS TRACE" AND STORAGE MECHANISM TECHNIQUES THAT ARE MADE POSSIBLE BY BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. SECOND, IT IS NECESSARY TO REFINE THE MANAGEMENT OF PEAK CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH "DECENTRALIZATION" AND CONSENSUS MECHANISMS. THIRD, IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNANCE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PEAK CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH "NON-FALSIFIABILITY" AND COLLABORATION MECHANISMS. FOURTH AND FINALLY, THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS PAPER ARE OFFERED. FIRST, FROM THE ASPECT OF SMART CITY CONSTRUCTION, IT IS NECESSARY TO PROMOTE THE COORDINATED CONSTRUCTION OF A LOW-CARBON CITY AND SMART CITY AND EXPLORE THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF LOW-CARBON DEVELOPMENT IN URBAN GOVERNANCE. SECOND, IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, WE NEED TO BUILD A LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT DIGITAL PLATFORM TO PROMOTE THE INTEGRATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND CORPORATE COMPLIANCE. THIRD, IN TERMS OF GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, WE NEED TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IN CYBERSPACE TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, THE LOW-CARBON DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, AND THE LOW-CARBON CONSTRUCTION OF A CYBER SOCIETY. FOURTH, WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM OF THE RULE OF LAW ON DIGITAL CARBON PEAKS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY.
385	AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL-EASTERN EUROPE AMENDED THEIR CONSTITUTIONS AND DECLARED LAW-GOVERNED STATE AS FORM OF REGIMES. 27 YEARS AFTER COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISMS THERE IS HUGE PROBLEM WITH RULE OF LAW. FORMALLY IS FUNCTION BUT PRACTICE DOES NOT CONFIRM IT. THE PAPER TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON USING THEORY OF TWO TRANSFORMATIONS; VISIBLE AND HIDDEN ONE.
386	WHAT RESEARCH ON DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING OFTEN OVERLOOKS IS THAT PROTEST AGAINST THE DECLINE OF RULE OF LAW ALSO EMERGES INSIDE STATE INSTITUTIONS. IN POLAND, THE JUDGES' ASSOCIATIONS ARE USING LEGAL MEANS, ORGANISING PUBLIC EVENTS AND URGING THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS TO STAND FIRM TOWARDS THE POLISH GOVERNMENT. IN THIS ARTICLE, I ANALYSE THE JUDICIARY'S COLLECTIVE ACTIONS AND MOTIVATIONS REGARDING ON- AND OFF-BENCH MOBILISATION. BASED ON IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH JUDGES, I SHOW HOW THEY FOCUS ON LITIGATION BUT USE LOBBYING AND PROTESTING AS COMPLEMENTARY TOOLS. MOREOVER, THEIR NETWORKING AND ADAPTATION OF MEASURES TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES PROVES THEIR ABILITY TO ACT STRATEGICALLY.
387	AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE "NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE" (MANNERS, 2002) THESIS, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN POLAND AND ITS IMPLICATIONS ON PRIVATE COMPANIES' PERFORMANCE AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS. THE RULE OF LAW PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN COMPANIES' INVESTMENT ACTIVITY, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME IS ALSO A CENTRAL CATEGORY IN THE EU'S LEGAL AND POLITICAL EDIFICE. THESE TWO PROBLEMS ARE RARELY ANALYSED TOGETHER AS INTER-LINKED REALITIES, WHICH, IN FACT, THEY ARE. THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS PAPER IS HOW THE RULE OF LAW'S DETERIORATION IN POLAND INFLUENCES THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT LEVEL IN THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND WHAT IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE FURTHER POLITICAL INTEGRATION OF THE EU. AMONG THE THEORIES APPLIED WERE THOSE LINKED TO THE INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH, I.E., NEW INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS, WHILE AMONG THE METHODS THEMSELVES, IT WAS QUALITATIVE METHODS WHICH WERE USED OVER QUANTITATIVE METHODS. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL CRISIS, WHICH HAS PLACED POLAND IN AN ADVERSARIAL POSITION TOWARDS THE EU, MAY RESULT IN A LONG-TERM DETERIORATION OF THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN POLAND. IT MAY ALSO INDUCE POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND LEGAL DISINTEGRATION IN THE EU.
388	THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS PRINCIPLES ARE PART OF THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND FORM THE BASIS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, REGARDLESS OF ANY DIVERGENCE IN THEIR INTERPRETATION AMONG THE MEMBER STATES. THE RULE OF LAW IS A CENTRAL STANDARD OF COMPARISON FOR THE EXISTENCE AND FUNCTION OF STATEHOOD ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, SPECIFICALLY THE OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW, THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, THE RIGHT TO A FAIR AND EFFECTIVE TRIAL BEFORE INDEPENDENT COURTS AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE RULE OF LAW IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE ABILITY OF DEMOCRACY TO FUNCTION AND AS WELL AS FOR A LASTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IT IS TIED TO CULTURAL REQUIREMENTS THAT LIE OUTSIDE THE LAW. THE NORMATIVE-CULTURAL DIMENSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IMPOSES PARTIAL LIMITS ON THE PRACTICAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE CLAIM FOR THE UNIVERSALITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS AN ELEMENT OF GLOBALIZATION.
389	THE CRISIS OF CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS PRESENT IN MANY COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND WORLDWIDE AND IT TAKES DIFFERENT FORMS. IN RESPONSE, MANY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS ARE EXPLORED IN ORDER TO OVERCOME NOT ONLY THE GROWING SENSE OF CRISIS, BUT ALSO ITS MANIFESTATIONS. ONE OF THE SUGGESTED ROUTES IN THE ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CIVIL JUSTICE AT THE EU AND NATIONAL LEVELS IS THE PRIVATIZATION OF JUSTICE THROUGH THE ADR MECHANISMS. IN MANY AREAS, WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER POLICY-MAKING BODIES, THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS BEING ENCOURAGED TO LEAVE THE COURTS FOR ALTERNATIVE FORUMS. THEREBY, THE ADR ARE PRESENTED AS MECHANISMS WHICH ARE FACILITATING INFORMAL, FAST, COST-EFFECTIVE AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE, AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVING PUBLIC RESOURCES. YET, IN SPITE OF THESE UNDENIABLE BENEFITS, ADR MECHANISMS ARE SUBJECT OF SOME DOUBTS AND EXPRESSED CONCERNS. ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS, WHICH HAS ALREADY SPARKED A WIDER DEBATE, IS WHETHER THE INFORMAL AND PRIVATE NATURE OF ADR IS HOSTILE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND ULTIMATELY TO JUSTICE ITSELF NAMELY, IF THE PRIVATIZATION OF CIVIL JUSTICE IS CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE JUSTICE ON AN EQUAL BASIS TO ALL CITIZENS, THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER THE ADR MECHANISMS ARE CAPABLE TO SECURE AND FOSTER THE VIRTUES OF THE RULE OF LAW (PUBLICITY, TRANSPARENCY, FAIRNESS, EQUALITY, ETC.). THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS DEBATE, RENEWING THE INTEREST IN ANALYZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIVATIZATION OF CIVIL JUSTICE AND THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE LIGHT OF EVOLVING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHETHER THE GROWING PRIVATIZED DISPUTE RESOLUTION LANDSCAPE IS UNDERMINING OR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW.
390	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND DOMESTIC ACTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW (JUDICIAL QUALITY) IN ROMANIA BETWEEN 2000 AND 2009. THIS STUDY OFFERS AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT ACROSS TWO KEY DIMENSIONS (1. JUDICIAL CAPACITY, 2. JUDICIAL IMPARTIALITY). THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT, WHILE THE REFORM ACTIONS OF DOMESTIC CHANGE AGENTS AND THE EU LED TO IMPROVEMENT ON THE JUDICIAL CAPACITY DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW (EFFICIENCY-RELATED ASPECTS), THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE PERSISTENCE ON THE JUDICIAL IMPARTIALITY DIMENSION (POWER-RELATED ASPECTS). THE LIMITED TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF THE EU IS EXPLAINED BY THE STRONG RESISTANCE OF CLIENTELISTIC VETO PLAYERS, WHO CAPTURED THE REFORM PROCESS AND UNDERMINED THE CREATION OF DE FACTO RULE OF LAW.
391	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW NATIONAL EXECUTIVES IN SERBIA AND BULGARIA ADDRESS EUROPEAN UNION (EU) RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY BY FRAMING IT WITHIN THE POPULISM/TECHNOCRACY DICHOTOMY. THE RULE OF LAW REMAINS ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF EU RELATIONS WITH THE TWO COUNTRIES. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE NUANCES OF PRE- AND POST-ENLARGEMENT EUROPEANISATION, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE TECHNOCRATIC AND POPULIST NARRATIVES EXPLOITED BY THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVES IN THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE EU AND THEIR DOMESTIC PUBLIC. RATHER THAN POSITIONING THE CURRENT EXECUTIVES UNEQUIVOCALLY EITHER AS POPULIST OR TECHNOCRATIC, WE ARGUE THAT THE POLITICAL ELITES ACT STRATEGICALLY IN USING BOTH POPULIST AND TECHNOCRATIC TECHNIQUES TOWARDS THEIR PUBLICS WHEN EXPLAINING INTERACTION WITH THE EU. WE EXPLORE THE EXTENT THIS TYPE OF EXECUTIVE BEHAVIOUR IS DETERMINED BY THE COUNTRIES' FORMALLY DIFFERENT STATUS. WHILE WE LOOK FOR THE LEVELS OF POSSIBLE SIMILARITY AND DISTINCTION IN THE TWO CASES/COUNTRIES STEMMING FROM THEIR DIFFERENT EU MEMBERSHIP STATUS, OUR FINDINGS CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF STRATEGIC DEFENSIVE POPULIST AND TECHNOCRATIC TECHNIQUES APPLIED TOWARDS THE EU AND THE NATIONAL PUBLIC IN BOTH COUNTRIES THE AIM OF THIS STRATEGY IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE EU RULE OF LAW PRESSURE AND TO SECURE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE EXISTING RULE OF LAW SHORTCOMINGS WITHIN THE PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. INTERESTINGLY, OUR RESEARCH DID NOT IDENTIFY SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT OF THE FORMALLY DIFFERENT STATUS TOWARDS THE EU OF THE TWO COUNTRIES.
392	BACKGROUND: MEDICAL DISPUTES ARE A RECURRENT AND PRESSING ISSUE IN HOSPITALS, POSING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE FUNCTIONING OF MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER RECEIVING RULE OF LAW PUBLICITY ON SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS IS RELEVANT TO PREVENTING MEDICAL DISPUTES AMONG HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.METHODS: WE COLLECTED THE DATA FROM 37,978 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS FROM 130 TERTIARY PUBLIC HOSPITALS. PARTICIPANTS WERE CLASSIFIED INTO TWO GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE PRESENCE OF RECEIVING RULE OF LAW PUBLICITY ON SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS. A SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSIS, AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS FOR MEDICAL DISPUTES.RESULTS: AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, 46.1% (17,506/37,978) EXPERIENCED MEDICAL DISPUTES. BEFORE PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSIS, THE PREVALENCE OF MEDICAL DISPUTES AMONG PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED RULE OF LAW PUBLICITY ON SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS WAS SIMILAR TO THAT AMONG PARTICIPANTS WHO DID NOT (P = 0.639). HOWEVER, AFTER PROPENSITY SCORE ANALYSIS, PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED THE RULE OF LAW PUBLICITY ON SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS DID NOT SHOW A BENEFIT EFFECT. THESE PARTICIPANTS HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE OF SUFFERING FROM MEDICAL DISPUTES THAN PARTICIPANTS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE PUBLICITY ON THIS PLATFORM (P=0.020). MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT RECEIVING THE RULE OF LAW PUBLICITY THROUGH SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS (P=0.010) OR MICROBLOG (P = 0.016), AND PREVIOUSLY FACING LEGAL ISSUES OUTSIDE OF MEDICAL WORK (P < 0.001) WERE RISK FACTORS FOR MEDICAL DISPUTES; PARTICIPATING IN LEGAL TRAINING ORGANIZED BY HOSPITALS (P=0.004) AND THE HOSPITAL RULE OF LAW BEING VERY GOOD (P=0.045) WERE PROTECTIVE FACTORS.CONCLUSION: MEDICAL DISPUTES ARE A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSION. HOWEVER, USING SHORT VIDEO PLATFORMS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO PREVENT DISPUTES. INSTEAD, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS CAN BENEFIT FROM PARTICIPATING IN LEGAL TRAINING AND HAVING A WELL-ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE HOSPITAL CONSTRUCT.
393	TERRITORIAL ANGUISH OF SPANISH RULE OF LAW -AS A PLURAL UNITY OF THE NATION WITH "THE RIGHT TO SELF-GOVERNMENT OF THE NATIONALITIES AND REGIONS"- IS RESOLVED FROM AN INTANGIBLE PROTECTION OF ITS CONSTITUTION: INTERNAL SELF-GOVERNMENT OF AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITIES DOES NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RIGHT TO SELF-DETERMINATION. HOWEVER, WE MUST FIGHT THE TREMENDOUS NONSENSE OF NATIONAL POPULISM, UNDERLINING THE MATERIAL INTANGIBILITY OF SPANISH CONSTITUTION WITH THE FEDERAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC STATE.
394	PURPOSE - SOUTH AFRICA (SA) HAS UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS SINCE THE CHANGE IN ITS POLITICAL REGIME IN 1994. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, SA HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH. ALTHOUGH IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT INSTITUTIONAL REFORM GENERALLY HAS POSITIVE IMPACTS ON FIRM COMPETITIVENESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN SA HAVE BEEN OF BENEFIT TO BUSINESSES IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE RULE OF LAW AND ASSESSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RULE OF LAW AFFECTS BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE STUDY USES MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION TECHNIQUES AND DATA, FROM A LARGE-SCALE FIRM LEVEL SURVEY (N = 751) OF SA BUSINESSES UNDERTAKEN BY THE WORLD BANK IN 2007, TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ON FIRM PERFORMANCE. FINDINGS - CRIME AND THEFT WERE FOUND TO HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACT ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, FOLLOWED BY CORRUPTION AND TAX ADMINISTRATION. POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COURT SYSTEM WERE NOT PERCEIVED TO AFFECT BUSINESS PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - ONGOING INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS AIMED AT IMPROVING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS IN SA SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DESIGN OF EFFECTIVE POLICIES TO ADDRESS CRIME, THEFT, CORRUPTION AND TAX ADMINISTRATION ISSUES FACED BY BUSINESSES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE STUDY IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BASED ON A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH CRIME AND THEFT, CORRUPTION AND TAX EFFECTIVENESS INHIBIT BUSINESS GROWTH IN SA.
395	RECENT RESEARCH IDENTIFIES HIGH BARRIERS TO REGISTERING A BUSINESS AS CRITICAL IMPEDIMENTS TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE WORLD. SIMILARLY, THE LACK OF CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW - ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT - IS ALSO CONNECTED TO ECONOMIC UNDERDEVELOPMENT. SCHOLARSHIP TREATS THESE FACTORS AS RIVAL EXPLANATIONS FOR UNDERDEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, I ARGUE THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CAUSAL MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN THE MARKETPLACE INFLUENCE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. SPECIFICALLY, I PRESENT EVIDENCE PERCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTHEAST ASIA DECLINE AS THE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON REGISTERING A BUSINESS INCREASE BECAUSE PUBLIC OFFICIALS USE THEIR GATEKEEPING POSITIONS TO EXTRACT RENTS AND RAISE THE COSTS OF FORMALIZING PRIVATE ENTERPRISES. HIGH DISINCENTIVES TO REGISTER A BUSINESS DRIVE ENTREPRENEURS UNDERGROUND, WHICH IN TURN LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE TO EXTORTION OR CONFISCATION BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND UNDERMINES PERCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. I EMPLOY POOLED CROSS-SECTIONAL TIME-SERIES DATA FOR ALL COUNTRIES IN SE ASIA BETWEEN 1996 AND 2010 TO TEST MY THEORETICAL ARGUMENT. I USE TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES, TIME SERIES, CROSS-SECTIONAL AND OLS REGRESSION MODELS TO ISOLATE CAUSAL MECHANISMS AND CAUSAL DIRECTIONS AMONG MY VARIABLES. MY ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE THE DELETERIOUS EFFECT OF LEGAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY ON THE RULE OF LAW AND PROVIDES A NEW DIRECTION FOR SCHOLARSHIP ON THE TOPIC. (C) 2013 WESTERN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION.

396	THIS IS A STUDY OF THE JURISPRUDENCE OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM IN THE THROES OF POST-REVOLUTIONARY RECONSTRUCTION. FOR ITS ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK, IT EMPLOYS THE EMERGING UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT FINDS THE MAIN FAULT LINE FOR THE INSTABILITY OF THE IRANIAN SYSTEM IN THE FISSURE CAUSED BY THOSE WHO WISH TO REFORM THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. IN THE RULE OF LAW THEY HAVE SOUGHT PROTECTION AGAINST THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF POWER BY THE CONSERVATIVE CLERICAL ELITE. EMBOLDENED BY ELECTORAL VICTORIES, THE REFORMISTS HAVE PRESSED FOR THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONSTITUTION. THAT DOCUMENT, HOWEVER, FAVORS THE HIEROCRACY OF THE CONSERVATIVE CLERICS. THEREFORE, THEY TOO HAVE COME TO EMPLOY THE LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLITICS. THE CONSERVATIVE CLERICAL JURISPRUDENCE IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE REFORMISTS. BOTH ARE ROOTED, HOWEVER, IN THE UNIQUE POLITICAL ISLAM BEQUEATHED BY KHOMEINI'S RADICAL REVISION OF IRAN'S SHI'ISM.
397	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE THE FOUNDING ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ECOLOGICAL RULE OF LAW AND THE NEW PERSPECTIVE FROM JUSTICE AND LAW AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE CHALLENGE THAT PESTICIDES REPRESENT IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SETBACKS. USING THE DEDUCTIVE METHOD AND THE DOCUMENTAL AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC PROCEDURES, THE PAPER DEVELOPS AN APPROACH ABOUT THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR NATURE, INTERCONNECTING IT WITH THE CONCEPT OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE AND WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. THEN, WE OUTLINE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SETBACKS OF THE LAST DECADE IN BRAZIL, ENCOMPASSING THE USE AND MODE OF OPERATION OF PESTICIDES AND THEIR ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THESE RETRACTIONS. THE RESEARCH VERIFIED THAT THE WIDE USE OF PESTICIDES IN BRAZIL, IN ADDITION TO BEING HARMFUL TO HUMAN HEALTH AND TO ECOSYSTEMS, ALSO POTENTIALLY VIOLATES BASIC RIGHTS AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH A MODE OF APPROPRIATION OF LAND INCOME THAT PERPETUATES THE CONCENTRATION OF POWER AND GENERATES ECOLOGICAL INJUSTICES. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ECOLOGICAL RULE OF LAW REPRESENTS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE BETTER REGULATION THAT LAW MUST PROVIDE TO COMBAT ENVIRONMENTAL SETBACKS AND TO GUARANTEE THE INTEGRAL PROTECTION OF HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF ECOSYSTEMS. GROUNDED IN INTEGRATIVE EPISTEMOLOGICAL BASES FOR NATURE AND IN AN EXTENDED CONCEPT OF JUSTICE FOR THE ENTIRE PLANETARY COMMUNITY, THIS ASPECT OF LAW REPRESENTS THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND JOINT GUARDIANSHIP BETWEEN THE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE HUMAN SPECIES.
398	WHAT DOES THE RULE OF LAW MEAN IN THE CHINESE CONTEXT? BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN BEIJING AND HONG KONG, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE VARIOUS WAYS POLITICALLY LIBERAL LAWYERS IN CHINA MAKE SENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR DISCOURSES AND COLLECTIVE ACTION. ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW IS FREQUENTLY INVOKED BY LAWYERS AS A LEGITIMATING DISCOURSE AGAINST THE AUTHORITARIAN STATE, ITS USE IN PRACTICE IS PRIMARILY FOR INSTRUMENTAL PURPOSES, AS BOTH A SWORD AND A SHIELD. FOR ACTIVIST LAWYERS IN BEIJING, THE PURSUIT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS NOTHING BUT A DISTANT DREAM INVOLVING A RESTRUCTURING OF THE STATE, AND THEY THEREFORE FOCUS THEIR MOBILISATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW AROUND BASIC LEGAL FREEDOMS AND THE GROWTH OF CIVIL SOCIETY. BY CONTRAST, HONG KONG LAWYERS HOLD THE AUTONOMY OF THEIR JUDICIARY AS A PARAMOUNT VALUE MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS A POWERFUL DEFENSIVE WEAPON AGAINST BEIJING'S POLITICAL INFLUENCE. THE RULE OF LAW AS A SHIELD IS ONLY EFFECTIVE WHERE ITS INSTITUTIONAL AND NORMATIVE FOUNDATIONS ARE SOLID (AS IN HONG KONG), AND IT BECOMES LITTLE MORE THAN A BLUNT SWORD FOR LAWYERS WHERE SUCH FOUNDATIONS ARE WEAK OR MISSING (AS IN MAINLAND CHINA).
399	USING DATA FROM EUROPEAN UNION STATISTICS ON INCOME AND LIVING CONDITIONS, THE STUDY EXAMINES THE CAUSES OF VARIATION IN THE UNEXPLAINED GENDER PAY GAP AMONG 25 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND CONSIDERS THE EFFECT OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT ON THESE. WE EMPLOY THE OAXACA-BLINDER DECOMPOSITION TO ESTIMATE THE UNEXPLAINED PART OF THE GENDER PAY GAP. TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON UNEXPLAINED GENDER WAGE DIFFERENCES, WE APPLY A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, WHERE THE ESTIMATED UNEXPLAINED GENDER PAY GAP IS USED AS A DEPENDENT VARIABLE AND SELECTED RULE OF LAW INDICATORS (SPECIFICALLY THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS RULE OF LAW AND THE LEGAL SYSTEM & PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEX) AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. CONTROLLING FOR OTHER INSTITUTIONS AFFECTING GENDER WAGE DIFFERENCES (SPECIFICALLY LABOUR MARKET REGULATION, WORK-FAMILY RECONCILIATION POLICY AND MALE WAGE DISPERSION), WE SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES IN THE QUALITY OF LEGISLATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACROSS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MAY PARTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIATION IN THE UNEXPLAINED GENDER PAY GAP. A VERY PROGRESSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN RULE OF LAW INDICES (FROM THE WORST TO THE BEST AMONG THE 25 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES EXAMINED) LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THE UNEXPLAINED GENDER PAY GAP BY 4.5-5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.
400	THIS PAPER CHALLENGES AN EMPIRICAL CLAIM ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL COURTS (ARBITRAZHNYE SUDY) MADE BY KATHRYN HENDLEY AND HER CO-AUTHORS IN THEIR PAPER "LAW, RELATIONSHIPS AND PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT: TRANSACTIONAL STRATEGIES OF RUSSIAN ENTERPRISE" IN VOL. 52, NO. 4, EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES IN 2000. BASING THEIR CASE ON A QUANTITATIVE SURVEY OF RUSSIAN FIRMS, THEY CONCLUDE THAT ECONOMIC ACTORS IN THE 1990S RELIED ON 'THE LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS' BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL COURTS WERE RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE. IN ORDER TO TEST THIS CLAIM ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR AND THE JUDICIARY, I ASK: WHAT TYPE OF BELIEF ABOUT CORRUPTION WAS HELD BY RUSSIAN ECONOMIC ACTORS WHO TRUSTED THE COMMERCIAL COURTS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION AT THE END OF THE 1990S? THE DATA SET IS DRAWN FROM A SURVEY OF 227 RUSSIAN FIRMS MADE IN 1997. I USE SELF-REPORTED DATA ON ECONOMIC ACTORS' PREFERENCE FOR USING OR NOT USING THE COMMERCIAL COURT (IN CASE OF A HYPOTHETICAL CONFLICT ABOUT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY) AS A PROXY FOR TRUST. A BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL SHOWS THAT ECONOMIC ACTORS WHO ACCEPTED CORRUPTION AS A FACT OF LIFE AT THE TIME OF MARKET ENTRY WERE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO TRUST THE COMMERCIAL COURTS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION THAN ECONOMIC ACTORS WHO REJECTED CORRUPTION. THIS FINDING CONTRADICTS ANY REASONABLE DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SUGGESTS THAT THE NEO-LIBERAL REFORMERS SHOULD HAVE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE CONTENT - RATHER THAN MERELY TO THE SPEED - OF REFORM.
401	CONFLICT AMONG THAILAND'S LEGAL ADVOCATES FOR POPULAR CAUSES OVER THE LEGITIMACY OF THAILAND'S TWO TWENTY-FIRST-CENTURY COUPS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF INEXORABLE GLOBALIZATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF CAUSE LAWYERS AS ONE OF ITS IMPORTANT VECTORS RUNS COUNTER TO THE EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES WHERE RULE OF LAW IS BEING ADAPTED TO THE MEANING OF NATION AND INDIVIDUAL IDENTITIES INFORMING EVERYDAY LIVES AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SOCIETY AND ITS GOVERNMENT. THIS ESSAY USES CAREER NARRATIVES OF THAI CAUSE LAWYERS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT BY EXAMINING SOURCES OF THE RULE OF LAW'S MEANING, INCLUDING EXPERIENCES SHARED BY EACH GENERATION OF CAUSE LAWYERS AND COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE SHAPING INDIVIDUAL CAREERS AND IDENTITIES. THEIR CAREER NARRATIVES SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOCIAL MOVEMENT LEADERS ON BELIEFS ABOUT THAILAND'S READINESS FOR DEMOCRACY AND MEANING OF A RULE OF LAW.
402	THE SUBJECT. THE ARTICLE EXAMINES A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL PROCEDURES IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE AUTHORS PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT STATE AND TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURES IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF LEGAL PROCEDURES ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE DESCRIPTION OF METHODOLOGY. THE AUTHORS USE METHODS OF COMPLEX ANALYSIS, SYNTHESIS, AS WELL AS FORMAL-LEGAL, COMPARATIVE-LEGAL, RESEARCH METHODS IN COMBINATION WITH THE METHODOLOGY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCE. THE MAIN RESULTS AND SCOPE OF THEIR APPLICATION. RECONCILING PUBLIC-IMPERIOUS DECISIONS, THE PROCEDURE SOMETIMES GOVERNS THE BEHAVIOR OF THE STATE ITSELF AND KEEPS IT IN CHECK, BRINGING STATEHOOD CLOSER TO RULE OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW NEEDS URGENTLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY A SYSTEM OF DIFFERENT LEGAL PROCEDURES: JUDICIAL, PUBLIC, CONTRACTUAL, ARBITRATION, ELECTORAL, REFERENDUM, PARLIAMENTARY, FEDERAL, MUNICIPAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (FISCAL, BUDGETARY, LICENSING, CONTROL, JURISDICTIONAL). IT WOULD SIMPLY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS PURPOSE WITHOUT SUCH PROCEDURES, AND THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW WOULD REMAIN NON-BINDING. NOT EVERY FORM AND FICTION PERFORMS LAW-SAVING WORK AND IT'S ALSO TRUE FOR THE CONDITIONAL ABILITY OF THE AUTHORITIES TO CREATE LAW AND JUDGE LAW. CONCLUSIONS. PROCEDURES, THEIR COMBINATIONS ARE DIFFERENT IN ORIGIN AND IN ACTION, BUT THE "NON-PROCEDURAL" LEGAL STATEHOOD CAN NOT EXIST. THEREFORE, PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS-ENCROACHMENTS ON THE JUDICIAL, PARLIAMENTARY, ELECTORAL PROCESS AND OTHER TYPES OF PROCESSES - ARE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS. LEGAL STATEHOOD BASED ON TRUST IS HARMED BY FREQUENT CHANGES IN PROCEDURES. THE EVOLUTIONARY CAPACITY OF LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IS THE CONDITION OF THEIR VIABILITY.
403	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE PRIMARY PROVISIONS OF THE CHINA-SOUTH AFRICA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY (BIT) AND ILLUSTRATES THAT THIS BIT DIFFERS IN MANY WAYS FROM SOUTH AFRICA'S BITS WITH WESTERN COUNTRIES. GIVEN CURRENT SHIFTS IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POLICY AND LAW IN BOTH SOUTH AFRICA AND CHINA, THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF THE CHINA-SOUTH AFRICA BIT, ULTIMATELY ARGUING THAT SOUTH AFRICA SHOULD ADOPT DIFFERENTIAL POLICIES TOWARDS THE CHINA-SOUTH AFRICA BIT BY MAINTAINING OR UPDATING THE EXISTING BIT BETWEEN THESE TWO NATIONS. AN UPDATED BIT COULD ACT AS A MODEL FOR FUTURE SOUTH-SOUTH BITS AND SHOULD INTEGRATE NEW ELEMENTS WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW, MAINTAIN A BALANCED INTEREST BETWEEN THE HOST STATE AND FOREIGN INVESTORS, AND CONFORM TO THE FUNDAMENTAL REALITIES OF THE PARTNER COUNTRIES.
404	POPULISM IS ON THE RISE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE (CEE). PERSISTENT ATTACKS ON LEGAL INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY REPRESENT THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF THE RISING POPULISM IN CEE. THE DEMOCRACIES IN CEE ARE NOT ABOUT TO COLLAPSE BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF POPULISM, YET THE POPULIST CHALLENGE TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY HAS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF 'ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY' IN THE REGION, CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW STILL REMAIN WEAK. ONLY STRONG, INDEPENDENT, AND PROFESSIONAL LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW CAN BRING FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION.

405	IN AN EXTENDED COMMENT ON WORK BY THIS PAPER'S AUTHORS, GUSTAFSSON IN A PREVIOUS ISSUE OF THIS JOURNAL REACHES SCATHING JUDGEMENTS ON RUSSIA'S ARBITRAZH (OR COMMERCIAL) COURTS AND DRAWS STRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA. HE CONCLUDES THAT LITIGANTS USE THE COURTS BECAUSE THEY CAN BRIBE THE JUDGES. HIS PAPER REVIVES OLD TALES ABOUT THE 1990S THAT WE SHOWED PREVIOUSLY WERE MYTHS. WE EXAMINE GUSTAFSSON'S ARGUMENT BOTH CONCEPTUALLY AND EMPIRICALLY. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS ARGUMENT RESTS ON TWO ERRONEOUS ASSUMPTIONS: THAT THE USE OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS EQUATES WITH TRUST IN THESE INSTITUTIONS AND THAT STRATEGIES FOR USE OF LAW ARE NOT CONTEXT-DEPENDENT. WE SHOW THAT GUSTAFSSON'S EMPIRICAL SPECIFICATION IS NOT UNIQUELY RELATED TO A SINGLE THEORY AND INDEED THAT ONE INTERPRETATION OF HIS RESULTS IS THAT ENTERPRISES USE THE COURTS BECAUSE THEY PERCEIVE LESS CORRUPTION THERE THAN IN OTHER VENUES, A THEORY DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO THE ONE GUSTAFFSON CHOSE EMPHASISE. USING A RICH DATA SET COLLECTED IN RUSSIA IN 1997, WE ARE LED TO THE TENTATIVE CONCLUSION THAT FIRMS TURNED TO THE ARBITRAZH COURTS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVE QUALITY OF THIS INSTITUTION.
406	THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUOUSLY STRESSED THE CHINESE MODEL AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS FOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE. AS A RESULT, IT IS WORTH STUDYING THE EFFECT OF CHINA'S RULE OF LAW ON THE GOVERNMENT'S SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, AND THE RULE OF LAW REGARDING THIS MODEL CAN ALSO PROVIDE A REFERENCE FOR GOVERNING OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER ADOPTS THE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS METHOD USING TIME-SERIES DATA FROM 2007 TO 2017 AND FROM 2002 TO 2019. THIS REFLECTS THE RULE OF LAW IN THE GOVERNMENT'S SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT VIA THE IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS, PEOPLE'S COURTS, PEOPLE'S PROCURATORATES, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS ON THE ECONOMY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON GOVERNMENT SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE RULE OF LAW IN FISCAL REVENUE AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS, RATHER THAN BEING ARBITRARILY DICTATED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE, POSITIVELY AFFECTS THE ECONOMY. THIS EFFECT WAS SEEN ONLY IN THE 2002-2019 TIME SERIES, BUT NOT IN THE 2007-2017 TIME SERIES. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT CHINA SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN MANAGING ITS COURTS AND PROCURATORATES TO ENHANCE THEIR ROLES IN ENSURING AND ACCELERATING SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATING GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. THAT IS, THE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT EFFECT OF THE PUBLIC SECTORS, WHICH INDIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE, IS INSUFFICIENT. THIS AND OTHER INSIGHTFUL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SUGGESTED TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT AND POLICYMAKERS IN MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. THEREFORE, THE SYSTEM AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THEIR GOVERNANCE SHOULD NOT ONLY FOCUS ON ECONOMIC EFFECTS BUT ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SUSTAINABLE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
407	THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS IN CONTEMPORARY CONSTITUTIONAL AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE. YET IT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN MORE OR LESS 'ANATOMICAL' VERSUS 'TELEOLOGICAL' WAYS. MARTIN KRYGIER HAS HELPED US BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS DISTINCTION, AND SHOWED HOW A TELEOLOGICAL APPROACH CAN HELP GUARD AGAINST THE MISUSE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN IDEAL. IN THIS SHORT ESSAY, I FURTHER SHOW HOW THE KIND OF TELEOLOGICAL APPROACH DEVELOPED BY KRYGIER CAN HELP GUARD AGAINST A RELATED, BUT DISTINCT DANGER-I.E. THE DANGER OF 'ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM', OR THE ABUSIVE APPLICATION OF RULE OF LAW IDEAS.
408	THE RULE OF LAW IS A PREREQUISITE TO ESTABLISH A STRINGENT AND EFFECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEM. SINCE RECOGNIZING THE ORIENTATION TO CHANGE THE VIETNAMESE STATE INTO THE VIETNAMESE SOCIALIST STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW IN 2001, IN THE MIDST OF INDUSTRIALIZATION AND MODERNIZATION, VIETNAM HAS WITNESSED THE MOST ACTIVE PERIOD OF MAKING LAWS EVER IN THE HISTORY SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE COUNTRY IN 1945. ALTHOUGH HAVING A DIVERSE LEGAL SYSTEM, THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RULE OF LAW REQUIRED FOR AN INDUSTRIALISED SOCIETY. THEREFORE, A FAR-SIGHTED VISION IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO BUILD A LEGAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH ENSURES JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE IN THE SOCIETY.
409	WHAT IMPACT DOES THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOUTH EASTERN EUROPE (SEE)? THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE ARGUES AND SHOWS THAT THE EU HAS: 1) A POSITIVELY REINFORCING (HEALTHY) EFFECT WITH REGARD TO JUDICIAL CAPACITY AND SUBSTANTIVE LEGALITY, I.E. THE ALIGNMENT OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND 2) A NEGATIVELY REINFORCING (PATHOLOGICAL) EFFECT WITH REGARD TO JUDICIAL IMPARTIALITY AND FORMAL LEGALITY (THE INNER MORALITY OF LAW). THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THE PATHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF EU-DRIVEN RULE OF LAW REFORMS BY REFERRING TO THE EU'S DEFICIENT REFORM APPROACH AND TO UNFAVORABLE DOMESTIC CONDITIONS, WHICH IN THEIR INTERPLAY REINFORCE CERTAIN REFORM PATHOLOGIES (LEGAL INSTABILITY, INCOHERENCE, POLITICIZATION) THAT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS SUPPORTED BY A MIXED METHOD STUDY. A QUANTITATIVE INDICATOR-BASED ANALYSIS MEASURES RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT ACROSS FOUR KEY DIMENSIONS ON THE BASIS OF A VARIETY OF DATA (E.G. SURVEY-BASED INDICATORS, CEPEJ DATA, AND A UNIQUE DATASET ON LEGISLATIVE OUTPUT). ADDITIONALLY, THE AUTHOR DRAWS ON A NUMBER OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS THAT HE CONDUCTED WITH MAGISTRATES FROM SEE AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE EU, THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES FROM THESE FINDINGS THAT EXTERNAL RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN WEAK RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES IS NOT TRANSFORMATIVE, BUT RATHER REINFORCES SYSTEMIC DEFICIENCIES THAT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW.
410	DESPITE PREVIOUS STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE IMPACTS OF VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS PEACE YEARS, NATURAL RESOURCES, AND THE RULE OF LAW ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI), EMPIRICAL FINDINGS REMAIN INCONCLUSIVE. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THESE FACTORS IN SHAPING HOST COUNTRY CONDITIONS THAT FACILITATE FDI INFLOWS. USING GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS, WE EXAMINE THE SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS OF PEACE YEARS, OIL WEALTH, AND THE RULE OF LAW ON FDI INFLOWS IN A SAMPLE OF NON-OECD COUNTRIES FROM 1970 TO 2009. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT ESTABLISHED PEACE IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN ATTRACTING FDI INFLOWS FOR BOTH OIL-EXPORTING AND NON-OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW VARY DEPENDING ON OIL WEALTH. OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES RECEIVE MORE FDI INFLOWS WHEN THEY HAVE A WEAK RATHER THAN A STRONG RULE OF LAW, WHILE NON-OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES TEND TO RECEIVE MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE A MODERATELY STRONG RULE OF LAW. WE ARGUE THAT COUNTRIES WITH OIL WEALTH COMBINED WITH A MODERATELY WEAK RULE OF LAW PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS (MNCS) IN EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES SEEKING MONOPOLY RENTS. CONVERSELY, COUNTRIES WITHOUT OIL WEALTH SHOULD CREATE STABLE YET EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROTECT PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PROMOTE LABOR MARKET FLEXIBILITY TO APPEAL TO NON-RESOURCE-SEEKING MNCS.
411	THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE OPTIMISM COMMON TO LIBERAL IR AND IL SCHOLARSHIP ON THE 'RULE OF LAW' IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPT OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS OFTEN EMPLOYED WITH SPARSE INQUIRY INTO THE POLITICS OF ITS PRACTICAL MEANING. SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON LIBERAL RESEARCH THAT ADVOCATES THE EMERGENCE OF A 'GLOBAL' JUDICIARY, AND THE CLAIM THAT JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE WILL MARGINALIZE STATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. RATHER THAN EMPLOY A ZERO-SUM CONCEPTION OF POWER, THIS ARTICLE REGARDS A PROSPECTIVE GLOBAL LEGAL SYSTEM LESS AS A CONSTRAINT ON STATE POWER AND MORE AS A RATIONALE FOR RULE 'THROUGH' LAW BY VESTED ACTORS. TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT, MICHEL FOUCAULT'S CONCEPT OF 'GOVERNMENTALITY' IS COMBINED WITH BARNETT AND DUVALL'S NOTION OF 'PRODUCTIVE POWER' TO DENOTE HOW LEGAL TECHNIQUES OF POWER ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL 'TRUTH' AND CONSEQUENTLY THE GOVERNANCE OF CONDUCT. THIS IS FURTHER ASSOCIATED WITH KOSKENNIEMI'S CRITICAL SCHOLARSHIP ON THE POWER OF LAW'S PERCEIVED OBJECTIVITY AND UNIVERSALITY. IN THIS VEIN, THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS HOW LIBERAL SCHOLARS USE THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL MODEL (THE MARBURY IDEAL) TO CLAIM THAT AN INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF 'GLOBAL' JUDICIAL AUTHORITY CAN DELIVER THE RULE OF 'NO ONE' IN GLOBAL GOVERNANCE. A GOVERNMENTALITY PERSPECTIVE IS THEN APPLIED WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE LACK OF SUPREME CONSTITUTIONAL RULES AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL MAKES JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE LESS A CHECK THAN A MEANS TO PROPAGATE NORMATIVE STANDARDS CONDUCIVE TO DOMINANT STATE POWER.
412	IN THE CONFLICT OVER THE SECESSION OF CATALONIA, THE INSTITUTIONS DOMINATED BY SUPPORTERS OF CATALAN INDEPENDENCE, MOST SPECIFICALLY THE CATALAN PARLIAMENT, CONSTRUCTED A NARRATIVE THAT PRESENTED THE QUEST FOR INDEPENDENCE AS A CONFLICT OF SOVEREIGNTY OPPOSING THE SPANISH STATE AND ITS CENTRAL AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES EMBODIED BY CATALAN PARLIAMENT. THIS NARRATIVE SIDE-LINED THE LINKAGE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW SO CENTRAL TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES. IN DOING SO, IT GENERATED A NEW CONFLICT AT THE PRACTICAL AND NARRATIVE LEVEL; NAMELY, ONE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY UNDERSTOOD AS EXTREME MAJORITARIANISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW UNDERSTOOD AS LEGALITY. THIS ARTICLE TRACES AND EXPLORES THE FORMATION OF THIS NARRATIVE AND DRAWS OUT IN DETAIL THE NORMATIVE IMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A CONFLICT BETWEEN MAJORITARIANISM AND LEGALITY.
413	AGENDA 2030 FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAS BROUGHT THE RULE OF LAW TO THE FOREFRONT IN THE QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WITH EMPHASIS ON AFRICA AND THE REST OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. TO ENSURE THAT LAW CONTRIBUTES TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE MISMANAGEMENT OF LEGAL PLURALISM IN COMMONWEALTH MEMBER COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, DEMONSTRATED BY THE CONFLICT OF LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE STAGNANT EVOLUTION OF INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNANCE IN THE AFTERMATH OF INDEPENDENCE AFTER COLONIAL RULE, AND THE CURRENT NEOLIBERAL ECONOMICS-ORIENTED/INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH BASED ON THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS. THE CURRENT APPROACHES TO RULE OF LAW REFORM AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE RESULTED IN THE STATUS QUO IN AFRICA, WHERE THE ROLE OF LAW AND LEGAL SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT EXPLICITLY EVIDENT. THE LAW IS NOT APPLIED CONSCIOUSLY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE ROLE OF LEGAL PRACTITIONERS IN DEVELOPMENT IS UNDERMINED. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF COLONIALISM AND POST-COLONIAL LEGAL SYSTEMS AND THE IMPACT OF THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS; THE INFLUENCE OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ACTORS IN PROVIDING RULE OF LAW REFORM ASSISTANCE; AND THE METHODOLOGY THROUGH WHICH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR LAW AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO DATE IS CRITICAL TO DEVELOPING NEW METHODS/APPROACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW AND DEVELOPMENT.
414	AS THE ASEAN MOVES TOWARDS ITS VISION OF A 'COMMUNITY,' ENFORCEABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF LEGAL STANDARDS, BROADLY THE "RULE OF LAW," HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION DUE TO THEIR IMPACT ON THE PREDICTABILITY OF SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR MARKETS, PEOPLE, AND POLICY MAKERS. THIS PAPER DRAWS TOGETHER RECENT FINDINGS AND SUGGESTS ASEAN STATES HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BUT REMAIN IN A STATE OF TRANSITION. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT BARRY WEINGAST'S PREDICTION THAT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO CREATE CONSISTENT RULES AND MOVE TO "OPEN ACCESS ORDERS" IN LINE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT, RATHER THAN INSTALL ARTIFICIAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS BEFORE GROWTH.
415	CARCERAL SYSTEM DURING THE 1980S. IT RETURNS TO THE ORIGINS OF THE PROJECT, THEN TO THE RESULTING PARLIAMENTARY BATTLE. THE AMBITION TO PRODUCE A COMPLETE PRIVATIZATION IS SEEN TO RELENT TO A PARTIAL CONCESSION, APPARENTLY SUPERFICIAL, CORRELATED TO A PROGRAMMED EXPANSION OF THE PRISON SYSTEM'S CAPACITY. THIS EPISODE IS A MAJOR MILESTONE IN THE DIFFUSION OF ECONOMIC THINKING THROUGH THE PENAL SYSTEM. BEYOND A LEGAL REDEFINITION, THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS EVENT PRIMED THE ACTUALIZATION OF A POLITICAL RATIONALITY THAT ADAPTED THE RULE OF LAW TO MANAGERIAL THOUGHT PROCESSES.
416	COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW ARE MUTUALLY SUSTAINING PILLARS OF A LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ORDER. STATE BEHAVIOURS UNDERMINING CUSTOMARY AND JUS COGENS LEGAL NORMS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY DISRUPTIVE TO POSSIBILITIES OF GLOBAL JUSTICE. THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT NON-REFOULEMENT AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT REFUGEES ARE CONNECTED TO UNIVERSALLY BINDING AND PEREMPTORY NORMS IN IMPORTANT WAYS SUCH THAT STATE VIOLATIONS OF THESE PRINCIPLES UNDERMINE THE PREMISES OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON US NORM VIOLATIONS IN THESE AREAS, CONTEXTUALISING POLICY CHANGES UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITHIN PREVIOUS US DEPARTURES FROM REFUGEE PROTECTION PRINCIPLES. GIVEN THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES AS A HEGEMONIC AND DEMOCRATIC ACTOR IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT US ACTIONS CONTRA NON-REFOULEMENT AND EFFORTS TO SHIRK REFUGEE RESPONSIBILITY-SHARING IN THE WAKE OF JUS COGENS CRIMES ARE PARTICULARLY DAMAGING TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS GOVERNANCE AND ATTENDANT NOTIONS OF LEGITIMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW.
417	ENGINEERING IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS EVOLVED THE MOST AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE GLOBALIZATION PROCESSES; IT IS HOWEVER IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES IMPLIED BY THESE PHENOMENA. THIS REFLECTION PAPER, DERIVED FROM THE THESIS "ECONOMIC RATIONALITY IN THE PLAYERS OF THE MARKET, THE CASE OF MOBILE PHONES", MADE IN THE UNIVERSIDAD DISTRITAL FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, 2011, ANALYZES THE ROLE OF THE STATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO A SOCIAL STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW AS COLOMBIA, PRESENTING AN OVERVIEW ON THIS TOPIC. IT ALSO SHOWS HOW GLOBALIZATION AFFECTS BOTH THE STATE'S AND THE POPULATION'S ROLES, THE CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY THIS PHENOMENON, AND ITS POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO AN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY THAT REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF A DEMOCRATIC AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT WITH INSTITUTIONS ABLE TO SUPPORT AND REGULATE THE MARKET, PROVIDE ROBUST MECHANISMS TO ERADICATE SOCIAL INIQUITIES AND, SPECIALLY, TO MEET THE NEEDS DEMANDED BY TODAY'S SOCIETY WITH ENOUGH DETERMINATION AND RESOURCES.
418	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE FORMS AND FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF CORRUPTION, AS WELL AS HOW CORRUPT PRACTICES AFFECT THE RULE OF LAW IN SLOVENIA, ITS ENVIRONMENT AND ITS CITIZENS. AFTER A LITERATURE REVIEW, THE STUDY ADOPTED A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACH BASED ON TEXTUAL ANALYSIS METHODS, CASE STUDIES AND THE GENERAL OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION FOR THE PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CORRUPTION HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE RULE OF LAW BECAUSE PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHO VIOLATE DUE PROCESS REDUCE CITIZENS' TRUST IN FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, CAUSING ADVERSE ECONOMIC EFFECTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION. A STUDY OF THE CASES OF CORRUPTION DETECTED ALSO REVEALS THAT MOST OF THESE BREACHES OF DUTY VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, WHERE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE BOUND TO THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION. THIS IS MOSTLY SHOWN IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES; IN MANAGING STATE PROPERTY AND RESOURCES; IN EMPLOYMENT; AND IN THE WORK OF FUNCTIONARIES. THE STUDY IS LIMITED TO CORRUPT PRACTICES IN SLOVENIA, THE RESULTS OF WHICH WILL BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE MAIN CAUSES AND REASONS BEHIND THE EMERGENCE OF CORRUPTION. IN THIS WORK, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS, PROBLEMS AND AREAS OF CORRUPTION AND THEIR IMPACT ON DIFFERENT ENTITIES; IN DOING SO, THE RISKS OF CORRUPT PRACTICES BECOME EVIDENT, MAKING IT EASIER TO DEVELOP BETTER STANDARDS OF PREVENTION.
419	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES THE THESIS THAT DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS MAY CONSTITUTE A TOOL FOR BREAKING THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND. IN 2017, AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF LEGAL CHANGES TO THE JUDICIARY, A DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM WAS CREATED IN POLAND TO ENSURE THAT JUDGES WERE SUBSERVIENT TO THE POLITICAL WILL OF THE AUTHORITIES. FROM THE BEGINNING, NEW DISCIPLINARY OFFICERS APPOINTED BY THE MINISTER OF JUSTICE (THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL) HAVE TARGETED JUDGES WHO DISAGREE WITH UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO THE JUDICIARY. DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS ARE BY NO MEANS REPRESSIONS THAT AFFECT JUDGES WHO DEMAND THAT OTHER AUTHORITIES RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES, ON A STEP BY STEP BASIS, THE PRACTICAL MECHANISMS TAKEN BY THE POLITICAL AUTHORITIES TO BREAK THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE MEASURES WHICH HAVE BEEN TAKEN CONCERNING THE JUDICIARY. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE JUDGMENT OF THE CJEU ON 19 NOVEMBER 2019 IN COMBINED CASES C-585/18, C-624/18, AND C-625/18 AND THE IMPLEMENTING RESOLUTION OF THE COMBINED CIVIL, CRIMINAL AND LABOUR AND SOCIAL INSURANCE CHAMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT ON 23 JANUARY 2020 AS WELL AS THE COLLAPSE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RECENT EVENTS SHOWS THAT AFTER THE SO-CALLED MUZZLE LAW (A BILL AMENDING THE ACT ON THE ORGANIZATION OF ORDINARY COURTS, THE ACT ON THE SUPREME COURT AND THE ACT ON THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY WAS SUBMITTED ON 12 DECEMBER 2019, AND THEN VOTED ON BY THE PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY IN THE LOWER HOUSE OF THE POLISH PARLIAMENT (SEJM) ON 20 DECEMBER 2019.) CAME INTO FORCE, THE APPLICATION OF THE RESOLUTION OF THE COMBINED CIVIL, CRIMINAL AND LABOUR AND SOCIAL INSURANCE CHAMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT ON 23 JANUARY 2020 IMPLEMENTING THE CJEU JUDGMENT IN THE JOINED CASES C-585/18, C-624/18, AND C-625/18 OF 19 NOVEMBER 2019 CAN BE AND, IN FACT, IS PENALIZED BY FURTHER DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH CONSTITUTES A REAL THREAT TO THE ALREADY WEAKENED RULE OF LAW. INSTITUTIONS AND, ABOVE ALL, JUDGES WHO ARE SAFEGUARDING THE RULE OF LAW ARE BEING DESTROYED.
420	RESEARCH SUMMARY PAST RESEARCH VIEWS INSTITUTIONS AS STABLE AND SLOW TO CHANGE AND USES INSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCES TO EXPLAIN CROSS-NATIONAL VARIATION IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES A NEW PERSPECTIVE TO INSTITUTIONAL THEORY, THAT OF SHORT-TERM INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. INTEGRATING INSIGHTS FROM COGNITIVE SCIENCE ALLOWS US TO THEORIZE NOT JUST ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SHORT-TERM INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE BUT ALSO ABOUT WHY AND HOW DETERIORATION VERSUS IMPROVEMENTS IN INSTITUTIONS HAVE DISTINCT EFFECTS. WE TEST HOW SHORT-TERM INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IMPACTS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A CROSS-COUNTRY MULTILEVEL STUDY. WE FIND THAT SHORT-TERM CHANGE IN THE RULE OF LAW AFFECTS ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY AND THAT INSTITUTIONAL DETERIORATION WEIGHS HEAVIER THAN INSTITUTIONAL IMPROVEMENT. WE ARGUE AND FIND THAT CHANGES IN THE RULE OF LAW ARE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP COMPARED TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS REGULATIONS. MANAGERIAL SUMMARY IT IS KNOWN THAT THE QUALITY OF INSTITUTIONS AFFECTS INDIVIDUALS' DECISIONS TO PURSUE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. YET, WE NEWLY INVESTIGATE EFFECTS OF YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES IN NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. NOT ONLY CHANGES IN BUSINESS REGULATIONS MATTER, BUT ALSO CHANGES IN MORE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE RULE OF LAW. WE FIND THAT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE HAS AN IMPACT BECAUSE, ON ITS BASIS, POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS FORM EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THEREFORE ABOUT THE RISKINESS OF THEIR INVESTMENT. DETERIORATIONS COMPARED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE RULE OF LAW ARE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP, CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT LOSSES LOOM LARGER THAN GAINS IN HUMAN DECISIONS.
421	THE MENSALAO TRIAL WAS BRAZIL'S MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL CORRUPTION TRIAL EVER AND AN EMBLEMATIC EX POST ACCOUNTABILITY SUCCESS. MORE THAN 28 INDIVIDUALS WERE CONVICTED IN RELATION TO A LEGISLATIVE VOTE-BUYING SCHEME, MANY BY THE VERY OFFICIALS THEY HELPED APPOINT. WE RELAY THE TRAJECTORY OF THE SCANDAL CUM TRIAL, EXPLAIN ITS SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION AND ASSESS ITS IMPLICATIONS. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE MENSALAO HAS PROVED PIVOTAL FOR BRAZIL'S INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL ADVANCES AND ASKS - MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AFTER A NEW CONSTITUTION - WHETHER THE COUNTRY IS ENTERING INTO A STRONGER, MORE ENDURING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
422	THIS ARTICLE DRAWS CONCEPTUAL, GENEALOGICAL, AND EMPIRICAL PARALLELS BETWEEN RELIGION AND THE RULE OF LAW. IT PRESENTS TWO RELATED ARGUMENTS. FIRST, DESPITE THE RULE OF LAW'S RELIGIOUS ROOTS, THE ATTEMPTS OF MODERN STATES SINCE THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO REGULATE AND STYMIE RELIGIOUS POWER ARE A KEY PART OF THE RULE OF LAW'S HISTORY. SECOND, AS A SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THEORY OF INTERNALLY COHERENT VALUES ABOUT A HIGHER POWER, THE RULE OF LAW OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THEOLOGY. POLITICAL ELITES, SCHOLARS, AND ACTIVISTS INVOKE THIS THEOLOGY OF THE RULE OF LAW AS CLERICS WOULD A RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE, FOR THEIR OWN SALVATION OR FOR THE SALVATION OF THE POOR AND MARGINALIZED.
423	MARTIN KRYGIER'S SCHOLARSHIP HAS INSPIRED A BROAD SWATHE OF WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW. IN TWO RECENT BOOKS, I SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF EFFORTS TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE US "WAR ON TERROR." THIS ESSAY SUMMARIZES THE LESSONS I LEARNED.
424	CHINA HAS ENTERED A NEW ERA IN OUR MARCH TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE PRINCIPAL CONTRADICTION FACING CHINESE SOCIETY HAS CHANGED INTO ONE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE'S EVER-GROWING NEED FOR A BETTER LIFE AND UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT. AT THE RULE OF LAW LEVEL, THE CONTRADICTION MANIFESTS ITSELF AS A GAP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS OF RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION AND ITS UNBALANCED AND INADEQUATE DEVELOPMENT IN LEGISLATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, LEGAL COMPLIANCE, LEGAL SUPERVISION, ETC. THE REPORT TO THE 19TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA POINTS OUT THAT LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT AND IMPORTANT GUARANTEE FOR SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IT OUTLINES AN IMPRESSIVE BLUEPRINT FOR BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE NEW ERA, AND FURTHER EXPOUNDS THE BASIC STRATEGY FOR BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA IN THE FUTURE. IT PROVIDES THE GUIDING IDEOLOGY AND PROGRAM OF ACTION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE RULE OF LAW AND ESTABLISHES THE GOAL OF BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF XI JINPING THOUGHT ON SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS FOR A NEW ERA, RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA WILL EMBARK ON A NEW JOURNEY.
425	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY CONTAINED IN THE PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION ON THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION'S BUDGET IN CASE OF GENERALISED DEFICIENCIES AS REGARDS THE RULE OF LAW IN THE MEMBER STATES. THE PROPOSED REGULATION ESTABLISHES A LINK BETWEEN A MEMBER STATE'S VIOLATION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE SUSPENSION OF EU PAYMENTS. THE TEXT EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND EU MONEY, BOTH FOR THE ERRING MEMBER STATE AND FOR THE EU AS A WHOLE. THE DISCUSSION SHOWS THAT, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EU-LEVEL APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW HAS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS, IT, AT THE SAME TIME, CREATES NEW RISKS. IT MAY UNDERMINE THE BALANCE OF POWERS IN THE EU BY EXPANDING THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC POWER OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES OVER OTHERS, THE POWER OF EU INSTITUTIONS OVER MEMBER STATES, AND THE POWER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OVER OTHER EU INSTITUTIONS. IT IS ALSO QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THERE IS A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG CAUSAL RELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW DEFICIENCY AND THREATS TO THE EU'S FINANCIAL INTERESTS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY WILL LEAD TO THE TRUE TRANSFORMATION OF NEGATIVE, ANTI-RULE-OF-LAW TRENDS IN SOME MEMBER STATES, WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW PROPOSAL IS CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO THE CURRENT CHALLENGES.
426	IRREGULAR MIGRANTS IN EUROPE ARE INCREASINGLY SUBJECTED TO STATE COERCION, SURVEILLANCE AND SPATIAL RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS CONTAINMENT, DISPERSAL AND FORCED TRANSFERS. LAWYERS USUALLY EVALUATE SUCH PRACTICES IN THE LIGHT OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, WHICH ONLY PROVIDES LIMITED PROTECTION. FOR THIS REASON, I PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE AND ASSESS COERCIVE STATE PRACTICES TOWARDS IRREGULAR MIGRANTS: THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION. IN THIS ARTICLE, I CONCEPTUALIZE NON-DOMINATION FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE. TO THIS END, I START FROM LOVETT'S PROCEDURAL ACCOUNT OF ARBITRARINESS; AND COMPLEMENT THIS WITH BENTON'S FOCUS ON UNACCOUNTABLE POWER AND PALOMBELLA'S ARGUMENT FOR 'DUALITY OF LAW'. IN THE SECOND PART OF THIS ARTICLE, I APPLY THIS NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK TO COERCIVE PRACTICES IN SHELTERS FOR IRREGULAR MIGRANTS IN THE NETHERLANDS. THIS ALLOWS ME TO DEMONSTRATE THE PRACTICAL RELEVANCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE THEORY. IT DISCLOSES HOW THE PROTECTION OF FREEDOM AS NON-DOMINATION, CONCEPTUALIZED FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE, SETS MORE DEMANDING CRITERIA FOR THE (COURTS OF) LAW THAN THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOES NOT REQUIRE NON-INTERFERENCE OR ELABORATE POSITIVE OBLIGATIONS FROM THE STATE. FOR IRREGULAR MIGRANTS, WHO DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESIDE IN THE TERRITORY, BUT WHO ARE ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF STATE POWER, NON-DOMINATION AS CONCEPTUALIZED IN THIS PAPER PROVIDES, IN MY VIEW, A NECESSARY FRAMEWORK OF REVIEW THAT ENSURES A KIND OF PROTECTION THAT IS CURRENTLY LACKING.
427	CRIME POSES A FORMIDABLE OBSTACLE TO DEMOCRATIZATION IN MANY PARTS OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD. NEW DEMOCRACIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FACE SOME OF THE HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATES IN THE WORLD. POLITICIANS, CITIZENS, AND POLICY-MAKERS HAVE RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT THE GROWING TIDE OF CRIMINALITY. PUBLIC INSECURITY, COUPLED WITH INEFFICIENT AND OFTEN CORRUPT JUSTICE SYSTEMS, MAKES DEMOCRATIZATION UNCERTAIN. EVEN IF NEW DEMOCRACIES DO NOT REVERT TO DICTATORSHIP, THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY MAY SUFFER IF CRIME CONTINUES TO RISE. ONE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE COMPONENT OF DEMOCRACY IS THE RULE OF LAW, AS PUBLIC INSECURITY MAY FUEL SUPPORT FOR EXTRA-LEGAL JUSTICE, AND A WILLINGNESS TO DISREGARD THE LAW WHILE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING SUSPECTED CRIMINALS. TO TEST THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE ASSESS THE WAYS IN WHICH CRIMINAL VICTIMIZATION, AS WELL AS FEAR OF CRIME, AFFECT CITIZEN SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. WE UTILIZE PUBLIC OPINION DATA COLLECTED IN SELECT COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA THROUGH TWO WIDELY USED SOURCES - THE LATIN AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION PROJECT (LAPOP) AND THE AFROBAROMETER SURVEYS.
428	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS), AND RULE OF LAW ON FOREIGN INVESTMENTS IN 51 ADVANCED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1997 TO 2017. THE STUDY IS MOTIVATED BY THE ARGUMENT THAT THE LACK OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS RESULTS MAINLY FROM ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION THAT CAN BE MITIGATED BY PROVIDING RELIABLE AND RELEVANT INFORMATION BASED ON IFRS AND A STRONG RULE OF LAW. USING COUNTRY-LEVEL DATA OBTAINED FROM THE IMF, WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS, AND WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS WEBSITES, IT WAS FOUND THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, IFRS, AND RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH EMPIRICAL ANALYSES INDICATE THAT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, IFRS AND RULE OF LAW HAVE INDIVIDUALLY A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS RELATIVE TO TOTAL INVESTMENTS, THIS POSITIVE EFFECT IS MITIGATED FOR INTERACTIONS OF THESE VARIABLES, SUGGESTING THAT INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS WOULD PREFER PORTFOLIO RATHER THAN DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIALLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ADOPTING IFRS AND AN EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW. THE FINDINGS ARE IMPORTANT FOR STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, IFRS, RULE OF LAW AND THEIR IMPACTS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENTS.
429	THE APPOINTMENT OF A DOUBLE-HATTED HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND SECURITY POLICY (HR) AND THE CREATION OF THE EUROPEAN EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE (EEAS) WERE TWO OF THE MAIN INNOVATIONS BROUGHT BY THE LISBON TREATY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S FOREIGN POLICY. ACCORDING TO THEIR MANDATES, THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE AND THE EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE AIM TO INCREASE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXTERNAL ACTION THUS ANSWERING TO ON-GOING CRITICISMS ABOUT THE LACK OF A "SINGLE VOICE". THIS PAPER AIMS TO ASSESS THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE MAIN POST-LISBON INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS BY USING THE CONCEPT OF "COHERENCE". UNDERSTANDING THIS CONCEPT AS SYNERGY AMONG EU POLICIES, THE STUDY WILL ANALYSE THE CURRENT CHALLENGES TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE EU IS PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN KOSOVO. BASED ON THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF EU DOCUMENTS AND THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE, AS WELL AS SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH EU OFFICIALS IN BRUSSELS AND KOSOVO, THIS PAPER QUESTIONS WHETHER THE INTRODUCTION OF THE HIGH REPRESENTATIVE AND THE CREATION OF THE EEAS IMPROVED THE COHERENCE OF EU INVOLVEMENT IN KOSOVO, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF RULE OF LAW ASSISTANCE.
430	THIS REVIEW ARTICLE CONSIDERS TWO PUBLICATIONS CONCERNING THE LAW COMMISSIONS CREATED UNDER THE LAW COMMISSIONS ACT 1965: FIFTY YEARS OF THE LAW COMMISSIONS: THE DYNAMICS OF LAW REFORM, A COLLECTION OF ESSAYS EDITED BY DYSON, LEE AND WILSON STARK, AND WILSON STARK'S MONOGRAPH, THE WORK OF THE BRITISH LAW COMMISSIONS: LAW REFORM ... NOW? THE WRITERS DEMONSTRATE HOW THE COMMISSIONS' LAW REFORM WORK HAS MADE A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO THE IMPROVED OPERATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND HOW THEY MUST CONTINUE TO ADAPT TO CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN WHICH THEY DISCHARGE THEIR STATUTORY DUTIES. THE REVIEW ARTICLE FOCUSES ON KEY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN WILSON STARK'S SEPARATE STUDY-CODIFICATION, PROJECT SELECTION AND LEGISLATIVE IMPLEMENTATION, AND THE SCOPE OF JUDICIAL LAW REFORM. ATTENTION IS ALSO DRAWN TO THE NEED FOR THE COMMISSIONS TO HAVE EFFECTIVE CAPACITY TO DISCHARGE THEIR RULE OF LAW FUNCTION BY PROMOTING FAIR, INTELLIGIBLE, ACCESSIBLE AND UP-TO-DATE LAW.
431	IN DECEMBER 2020, THE EU INSTITUTIONS FINALLY APPROVED THE NEW RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY REGULATION AFTER A CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THE NEW REGULATION ALLOWS THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL TO SUSPEND EU FUNDS IN CASE OF BREACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW THAT HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE EU BUDGET AND FINANCIAL INTERESTS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE NEW REGULATION AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE RISE OF CONDITIONALITY AS A TOOL OF EU GOVERNANCE. IT ARGUES, IN CONTRAST TO SOME OF THE FIRST ANALYSES OF THE NEW REGULATION, THAT THE AMENDMENTS ADOPTED DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS CANNOT SIMPLY BE SEEN AS A WATERED-DOWN COMPROMISE, BUT WERE CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE LEGALITY OF THE NEW INSTRUMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EU'S GROWING RELIANCE ON CONDITIONALITY CONTINUES TO RAISE PROFOUND CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND ACADEMIC DEBATE.
432	ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS DETERMINING RATES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS FOUND THAT COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON GROWTH PERFORMANCE. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO DATE SUGGESTS THAT MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTES GROWTH, WHILE ADOPTING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DOES NOT APPEAR TO IMPROVE GROWTH PERFORMANCE. WE FIND THAT THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO SAMPLE SELECTION AND TO ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE. WHEN AN IDENTICAL SAMPLE OF COUNTRIES IS USED, WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DO ENJOY SUPERIOR GROWTH PERFORMANCE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GROWTH AND DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE USED. ESTIMATES USING INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TECHNIQUES SUGGEST THAT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS DO EXPERIENCE BETTER GROWTH PERFORMANCE. THESE RESULTS ARE ESPECIALLY RELEVANT FOR DEVELOPING NATIONS.

433	THE PAPER EXPLORES HUNGARY AND POLAND'S COMPLIANCE SIGNALS CONVEYED DURING THE EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESS AND THE RESPONSES TO THESE SIGNALS BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS JUDICIAL ORGANS AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE COMMITTEE OF MINISTERS AS ORGANS SUPERVISING COMPLIANCE. AFTER BOTH STATES TURNED ILLIBERAL EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS BEGAN CONDEMNING THE CONDITION OF RULE OF LAW IN BOTH STATES. YET, THEIR ENDEAVOUR-AS EVIDENT FROM MEASURES IMPOSED UPON POLAND, BUT NOT HUNGARY-APPEARS INCONSISTENT. THE PAPER ASCRIBES THIS TO STATES' DIFFERING EXPRESSIONS OF COMMITMENT TO COMPLY WITH RULE-OF-LAW-RELATED RULINGS AS SIGNALLED DURING SUPERVISION. IT ARGUES THAT HUNGARY'S SIGNALLED CONCILIATORY ATTITUDE COMPARED TO POLAND'S OVERT DEFIANCE INVITES MORE DEFERENCE FROM THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS AND CONCLUDES THAT CONVEYING CONCILIATORY SIGNALS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLIANCE MAY BE USED TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE AND, ULTIMATELY, THE SUCCESS OF RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
434	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES ONE OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, SUCH AS THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF LAW. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OPINIONS OF SCHOLARS WHO DEFINE THIS PRINCIPLE WERE A NATURALIZED AND THEIR MAIN CHARACTERISTICS STAND OUT. IN ADDITION, THE ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ATTEMPT TO COMPARE THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF LAW WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HIGHLIGHT ITS GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS AND DIFFERENCES. IN METHODOLOGICAL TERMS, THE TECHNIQUE OF DOCUMENTARY RESEARCH AND COMPARATIVE HERMENEUTICS WAS USED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CATEGORIES OF "RULE OF LAW" ARE UNDERSTOOD BY SEVERAL AUTHORS VERY DIFFERENTLY, THERE IS NO CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEFINITION OF THIS CONCEPT; OFTEN THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES CONTRADICT EACH OTHER: THEY EXPRESS THE STATIC OR DYNAMICS OF THE RULE OF LAW, SO THEY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DOCTRINAL LEGAL AWARENESS AND STUDY. UNDER MODERN SOCIO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS, IT WOULD BE BETTER TO USE UNITY OF LAW AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW; BECAUSE, IT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY OF LAW THAT CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE AND RATIONAL PROTECTION AND REALIZATION OF THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF CITIZENS, SOCIETIES AND STATES.
435	ALTHOUGH IN THE 60'S OF LAST CENTURY ACQUIRED AND IMPORTANT RELEVANCE, NOW SOME CONSIDER OVERCOME THE DEBATE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TECHNOCRACY OF PARTICIPATION AND EXPERTISE. HAVING REACHED A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS OF DECISION-MAKING AND LEGITIMACY, BOTH SYSTEMS WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY RATHER THAN CONFLICTING. THIS COMMUNICATION IS INTENDED TO RAISE THE DESIRABILITY OF REOPENING THAT DEBATE, BUT REFORMULATED IN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND TECHNOCRACY. FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW, THE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF A PROCEDURE IN THE DECISION-MAKING SHOULD BE ASSESSED, NOT ONLY FROM ITS ORGANIZATION, BUT DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE DECISION IS RESPECTFUL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OR NOT.
436	FOLLOWING CIVIL WAR, (RE)ESTABLISHING OPERATIONAL, LEGITIMATE AND ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE SYSTEMS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES IS TOUTED AS CRITICAL FOR SUSTAINABLE PEACE. WHILE RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMING HAS GAINED SIGNIFICANT TRACTION AS THE FAVOURED SOLUTION INTERNATIONALLY, QUESTIONS REMAIN AS TO WHAT APPROACH SUCH PROGRAMMING SHOULD TAKE, AND HOW COMPLEX DYNAMICS IN SOCIETIES EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR AFFECT LOCAL POPULATIONS TRYING TO ACCESS JUSTICE, PARTICULARLY IN LEGALLY PLURAL SETTINGS. THIS ARTICLE SHEDS LIGHT ON THESE QUESTIONS BY EXAMINING A CASE STUDY OF A PROGRAMME THAT TOOK AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO THE 'RULE OF LAW ORTHODOXY'. THE PROGRAMME, KNOWN AS PEACE FOUNDATION MELANESIA, ENGAGED WITH CUSTOMARY JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN POST-CONFLICT BOUGAINVILLE, AND TOOK INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE CONTEXTUAL REALITIES FACED BY LOCAL POPULATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE MATERIAL PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY-DRAWN FROM 42 INTERVIEWS-SHOWS HOW POST-CONFLICT INSECURITY, AND RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL ILL-HEALTH AND CYCLES OF RETALIATION PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT PART IN PREFERENCES, EXPERIENCES, AND IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMME FOR LOCAL POPULATIONS.
437	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT TAIWAN AND CHINA SHOULD SIDESTEP THE ISSUE OF WHAT CONSTITUTES "ONE CHINA" AND INSTEAD IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BETTER SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT ONE ELEMENT OF A BETTER SYSTEM IS PROSPERITY, WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE QUITE KEEN ON. BUT THE REMAINING TWO COMPONENTS FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY CANNOT BE REALIZED WITHOUT RULE OF LAW SUN YAT-SEN'S THREE STAGES OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION OFFERS A VIABLE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE TWO SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT. THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA IS, WITH A FEW NOTABLE DIFFERENCES, AT A SIMILAR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AS IT WAS IN TAIWAN UNDER MARTIAL LAW. SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS' LEGAL DEVELOPMENT COULD DERAIL THEIR EFFORTS TOWARD CLOSER TIES. CHINA HAS TO OVERCOME MANY CHALLENGES BEFORE IT CAN UNDERTAKE LEGAL REFORM; HOWEVER, THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE AND HOPE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MATURATION OF ITS LEGAL SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE. DISCUSSIONS CENTERED AROUND "CLEAN AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE" WOULD HELP TAIWAN AND CHINA TAKE THE FIRST OF MANY PRACTICAL STEPS TO ACCELERATE CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGE AND RELATIONS.
438	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EVOLUTION OF LEGAL STRATEGIES THAT THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS USED IN MANAGING HONG KONG AFFAIRS IN THE PAST THREE DECADES. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE BEIJING GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED THE TACTIC OF "LEGALISATION WITHOUT DEMOCRATISATION" TO NEUTRALISE POLITICAL RESISTANCE, TO RESOLVE THORNY ISSUES, AND TO STIFLE PRO-INDEPENDENCE VOICES. HOWEVER, AS BEIJING'S LEGAL STRATEGIES FOR HONG KONG HAVE BECOME MORE HANDS-ON AND ASSERTIVE, THE FLAWS AND INSTRUMENTALISM OF CHINESE-STYLE "RULE OF LAW" HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY SALIENT, GIVING RISE TO DEEPENING CONFLICTS WITH THE HONG KONG COMMON LAW SYSTEM. LEGALISATION WITHOUT DEMOCRATISATION HAS GIVEN RISE TO A WORRYING TREND OF RISING AUTHORITARIAN LEGALISM IN HONG KONG.
439	THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES A NOVEL ACCOUNT OF AD HOMINEM CRIMINALISATION THAT DRAWS UPON A DISTINCT THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS EGALITARIAN FOUNDATIONS. EMPLOYING THE RECENT AND CONTROVERSIAL EXAMPLE OF KNIFE CRIME PREVENTION ORDERS, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE OFFENSIVE WEAPONS ACT 2019, IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CIVIC EQUALITY IS CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE VICE OF AD HOMINEM CRIMINALISATION AS AN ABERRANT FORM OF GOVERNMENT BY LAW. THIS VICE CONSISTS IN THE MANNER THAT SUCH CRIMINALISATION INDIVIDUALISES, DIFFERENTIATES AND INSTRUMENTALISES THE REGULATORY SUBJECT, PLACING THEM OUTWITH THE BOUNDS OF CIVIC EQUALITY AS ESTABLISHED BY THE RULE OF LAW.
440	SOME AFRICAN STATE RESPONSES TO TRANSNATIONAL ORGANIZED CRIME (TOC) ARE CRITICIZED FOR BEING OVERLY FOCUSED ON THE USE OF FORCE BY MILITARY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. POLICY APPROACHES THAT PROMOTE USING CRIMINAL LAW TO DETER TOC HAVE HELPED TO SHIFT FOCUS AWAY FROM THE KINETIC SOLUTIONS THAT MAY OTHERWISE PREVAIL BY DEFAULT. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT TOC IS ENABLED BY A RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT GO BEYOND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DOMAIN. SYNTHESIZING RECENT INSIGHTS FROM EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON AFRICAN TOC FROM ACADEMIA, THINK TANKS, AND POLICY-ORIENTED INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THIS ARTICLE MAKES THE CASE FOR A MORE HOLISTIC, PEOPLE-CENTERED JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW APPROACH TO ADDRESSING TOC. SUCH AN APPROACH CONCEIVES OF RULE OF LAW NOT MERELY AS THE PROCESS OR RESULT OF ENFORCING THE LAW, BUT AS A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PRACTICE OF PROMOTING MUTUAL RESPECT AND EQUALITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT ACTORS IN THE STATE AND SOCIETY. THIS PEOPLE-CENTERED JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK CREATES SPACE TO ADDRESS VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNANCE FACTORS AFFECTING THE INCIDENCE OF TOC, INCLUDING (I) THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS, (II) THE POPULAR LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE'S REGARD FOR THE LAWS ON PAPER; AND (III) THE PREVALENCE OF A BALANCE OF POWERS ENABLING THE OVERSIGHT OF ALL ACTORS INVOLVED IN TOC, ESPECIALLY CERTAIN STATE OFFICIALS WHO FACILITATE IT. BEYOND THE CONVENTIONALLY PUNITIVE APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING TOC, AFRICAN LEADERS COULD EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF MORE INCLUSIVE POLICYMAKING PROCESSES, THE COMBINED USE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE DRIVERS OF CRIME, AND THE EMPOWERMENT OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS AFFECTED BY COUNTER-TOC POLICY DECISIONS MADE BY ELITES.
441	EU ENLARGEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POLITICAL PROCESS. THAT SAID, THE RULE OF LAW IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AND PRINCIPLE OF THE EU ENLARGEMENT POLICY. IMPLEMENTATION OF EU DRIVEN REFORMS IN CANDIDATE COUNTRIES LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE RULE OF LAW-BASED ENLARGEMENT AS WELL AS ON A CLEAR EU PERSPECTIVE. OVERPOLITICISATION OF THE ENLARGEMENT PROCESS RENDERS THE EU'S ENLARGEMENT LAW FUTILE AND UNDERMINES BOTH THE TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT OF THE PRE-ACCESSION PROCESS AND EU'S OWN VALUES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENLARGEMENT CONDITION FOR SETTLEMENT OF BILATERAL DISPUTES, WHICH BECAME PRONOUNCED IN THE EU ENLARGEMENT TOWARDS THE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES, IS HAVING THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CONTRIBUTING TO DETERIORATION RATHER THAN PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN BOTH EU CANDIDATE COUNTRIES AND THE EU'S ENLARGEMENT PROCESS. LACK OF PREDICTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW ACCORDINGLY, MAKES THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONDITIONALITY IMPOSSIBLE. A GENUINE RECONSIDERATION OF THE CONDITION FOR SETTLEMENT OF BILATERAL DISPUTES WITHIN THE EU ENLARGEMENT FRAMEWORK, CLEAR EU PERSPECTIVE AND VIABLE WAY FORWARD ARE URGENTLY NEEDED FOR BRINGING RULE OF LAW AND THE EU'S CREDIBILITY ON TRACK.
442	TRAGIC CONSCIOUSNESS, WHICH ORIGINATED IN CHILDHOOD, IS COMPLEX COMPASSION BASED ON STRONG SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS. AFTER BEING MORALIZED, TRAGIC CONSCIOUSNESS PRESENTS THE DICHOTOMY OF GOOD AND EVIL, WHICH HAS NOT ONLY PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED THE FORMATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE, BUT ALSO CRADLED THE THEORY OF NATURAL LAW AND RELIGIOUS SPIRIT. MODERN JURISPRUDENCE ATTEMPTS TO GET RID OF THE SHACKLES OF CLASSICS AND CHRISTIAN HUMANISM, TO SHAPE THE AUTONOMOUS AND SELF-CONSISTENT IMAGE OF LAW WITH THE DE LEGE LATA AS CENTER. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR MODERN JURISPRUDENCE TO SURPASS THE NATURAL LANGUAGE WHICH ROOTED IN TRAGIC CONSCIOUSNESS, AND IMPOSSIBLE TO NEGLECT OR DENY THE INDEPENDENT VALUE OF THE HUMAN. THE INHERENT CONFLICT WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW MAKES IRONICALLY A TRAGEDY, ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA.
443	THE NEED TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW IN MODERN DEMOCRACIES IS A SIGN OF THEIR CULTURAL AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENT. THE SET OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT DEFINE THE INTERACTION OF STATE AND SOCIETY DEFINES HUMAN RIGHTS AS A BASIC VALUE, AND THE RULE OF LAW, IN TURN, ENSURES THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RIGHTS TO THE NEW APPLICATION OF NORMS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TASKS OF ENSURING THE FUNCTIONING OF A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF A DEMOCRATIC STATE.
444	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS AN APPARENTLY PERPLEXING ASPECT OF DEMOCRATIZATION IN BRAZIL: THE USE BY NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL GANGS (COMANDOS) FROM THE POOR URBAN PERIPHERIES AND PRISONS OF THE DISCOURSES OF DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP, JUSTICE, AND RULE OF LAW TO REPRESENT THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS AND INTENTIONS. I SITUATE THIS USE WITHIN AN UNSETTLING DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA GENERALLY DURING THE LAST 30 YEARS: THE COINCIDENCE OF INCREASING POLITICAL DEMOCRACY AND INCREASING EVERYDAY VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE AGAINST CITIZENS. MY DISCUSSION CONSIDERS THESE NEW TERRITORIALIZATIONS OF POWER AND VIOLENCE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES FOR CITIZENSHIP, DEMOCRACY, AND URBANIZATION. TO BRING THEM TO LIGHT, I FOCUS ON PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS BY BRAZILIAN CRIMINAL GANGS THAT TYPICALLY COMBINE RATIONALITIES OF CRIME WITH THOSE OF DEMOCRACY, CITIZEN RIGHTS, RULE OF LAW, AND REVOLUTION. I ALSO COMPARE THEM WITH PUBLIC DECLARATIONS MADE BY THE POLICE. I ANALYZE BOTH IN RELATION TO THE HISTORICALLY DOMINANT PARADIGM OF BRAZILIAN CITIZENSHIP THAT DEMOCRATIZATION DESTABILIZES. I THEN EVALUATE THIS DESTABILIZATION WITH REGARD TO THE NEW KINDS OF VIOLENCE AND PARADIGMS OF INSURGENT CITIZENSHIP THAT HAVE EMERGED AS CHARACTERISTICS OF URBANIZATION AND DEMOCRATIZATION WORLDWIDE.
445	THE COURT OF JUSTICE INTERPRETED THE MEMBER STATES' OBLIGATION TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION BEFORE NATIONAL COURTS EXTENSIVELY, FINDING THAT THEY MUST ENSURE THE INDEPENDENCE OF NATIONAL COURTS WHOSE JURISDICTION MAY POTENTIALLY INVOLVE THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF EU LAW. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ASSOCIACAO SINDICAL DOS JUIZES PORTUGUESES JUDGMENT CAN HARDLY BE OVERESTIMATED IN THE CONTEXT OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN SOME MEMBER STATES.
446	RULE OF LAW RHETORIC IS INCREASINGLY COMMON, BOTH IN U.S. LEGAL LITERATURE AND IN THE REALM OF INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE. IN THE FIELD OF LAW AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE RULE OF LAW REVIVAL IS LEAD BY THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (IFIS). RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE HAS ALSO COME TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FIELDS OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS AND COMPARATIVE LAW, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO EAST ASIA. THIS REVIEW BEGINS WITH A DISCUSSION OF RULE OF LAW RHETORIC IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN TRADITION. IT THEN DISCUSSES THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW RENAISSANCE, FOCUSING ON THE ROLES THAT RULE OF LAW RHETORIC PLAYS IN THE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE IFIS. BECAUSE THE CLAIM IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS KEY TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THIS REVIEW EXPLORES THE EXTENT TO WHICH NORTHEAST ASIA'S OUTSTANDING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CONFORMED TO THE RULE OF LAW. AN EXPLORATION FOLLOWS OF HOW THE RULE OF LAW-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LITERATURE HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME, IN LINE WITH CHANGING IDEAS ABOUT ECONOMICS AND ABOUT DEVELOPMENT ITSELF. FINALLY, THIS REVIEW EXPLORES HOW RULE OF LAW IS USED IN THE LITERATURES OF COMPARATIVE POLITICS AND COMPARATIVE LAW.
447	THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT SEPARATION OF POWERS OFFERS A MITIGATING FORCE IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIMITS OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE UN'S PRIMARY ORGANS AND PROVIDES A TOOL THROUGH WHICH ONE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDER THREAT. WHETHER OR NOT ONE AGREES THAT SEPARATION OF POWERS AS SUCH HAS LEGAL APPLICABILITY TO THE UN IN A STRICT SENSE, THERE IS VALUE IN CASTING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS LENS OVER THE ORGANIZATION AS IT OPERATES NOW. THIS EXERCISE IS WORTHWHILE NOT JUST FOR POSTERITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE EVOLUTION OF LAW OUGHT TO BE CAREFULLY MONITORED, PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN REGARD FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL NORMS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING DERISION AND EVEN DIRECT CHALLENGE. THAT CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVE SLOWED THE SECURITY COUNCIL FROM ITS EARLIER ACTIVISM IS PRECISELY WHY THIS ARTICLE IS TIMELY, BECAUSE IT IS IN THESE TIMES THAT INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY GETS LOST, THE BOUNDARIES OF AUTHORITY BLUR, AND POPULIST NARRATIVES BRING THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THREAT.
448	A STUDY OF POST-ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE OF CROSS BORDER ACQUISITIONS INVOLVING EMERGING MARKET FIRMS SHOWS THAT WHEN DEVELOPED MARKET FIRMS ACQUIRE EMERGING MARKET FIRMS, RULE OF LAW IN THE TARGET COUNTRY HAS A SIGNIFICANT FAVORABLE IMPACT ON POST-ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE; WHILE COUNTRY LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HAS NO IMPACT. CONTRARILY, WHEN EMERGING MARKET FIRMS ACQUIRE DEVELOPED MARKET FIRMS, COUNTRY LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IN THE TARGET COUNTRY HAS A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON POST-ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE, WHILE RULE OF LAW HAS NO IMPACT. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT IF RULE OF LAW IN THE EMERGING MARKET TARGET COUNTRY IS LESS EVOLVED BUT NOT DISMALLY LOW, THE DEVELOPED MARKET ACQUIRER CAN SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENFORCE BETTER DISCIPLINE AT THE FIRM LEVEL IN THE TARGET FIRM AND THEREBY ENHANCE POST-ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF EMERGING MARKET FIRMS' ACQUISITIONS, LOWER THE DIFFERENCE IN COUNTRY LEVEL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, SUPERIOR GAINS ARE ASSURED. THE STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT LOCATION LEVEL FACTORS AFFECT POST ACQUISITION PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTLY FOR ADTE AND AETD ACQUISITIONS AND ADTE ACQUISITIONS GIVE IMPORTANCE TO RULE OF LAW, WHILE AETD ACQUISITIONS EMPHASIS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FACTORS TO ENSURE VALUE CREATION IN ACQUISITIONS AND THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST AFTER CONTROLLING FOR COUNTRY EFFECTS AND YEAR EFFECTS.

449	PUNISHING THE CRIMINALS IS ONE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE MECHANISMS TO COMPENSATION AND REPARATION FOR VICTIMS AND SOCIETY. IN THIS REGARDS SOME OF THE PUNISHMENTS ARE DETERMINED BY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS IN EVERY SOCIETY. IMPRISONMENT IS ONE OF THESE PENALTIES WHICH SPECIFIED IN THIS REGARD AND THROUGH THIS PUNISHMENT THE CONVICTED PERSONS ARE DETAINED IN PRISON. HOWEVER, THE GUILTY IS SENTENCED TO PRISON AND RESTRICTION OF HIS OR HER LIBERTIES, BUT SHE OR HE HAS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT MUST BE PROTECTED EVEN IF IN PRISON AND HAS THE RIGHT TO HOW TO BE PUNISHED. ALL OF THESE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE PROTECTED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ISSUE MEANS THAT HOW TO BE PUNISHED IS RESTRICTED UNDER THE DEFINITE PRINCIPLES WHICH HAVE TO BE EXERCISED WHEN THE RETRIBUTION AND PUNISHMENT IS ONGOING. THIS MATTER OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE IS CONSIDERED AS RIGHT ON HOW TO BE PUNISHED. THE AREA OF THIS RIGHT AND AUTHORITY OF PRISON'S HEADS AND ITS PERSONNEL IS DETERMINED BY LAW. IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND PROTECTION OF PRISONER'S HUMAN RIGHTS AND REGULATING MANNER WITH THEM AND ALSO FOR PRISON MANAGEMENT, THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDED A SET OF GUIDELINES. ACCORDING TO THESE GUIDELINES PRISON IS MANAGED IN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS IN THIS CONTEXT THE PRISONER'S RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED EFFECTIVELY. THESE GUIDELINES ARE PROVIDED IN SOME OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THESE GUIDELINES AND IN RESPECT OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS ASPECTS WHICH RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL, EDUCATIONAL, MANAGEMENT, HEALTH CARE, PERSONNEL AND HUMANISTIC DIMENSIONS OF IMPRISONMENT THESE GUIDELINES AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE STUDIED AND ANALYZED.
450	THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM DURING THE RECOVERY FUND NEGOTIATIONS WAS, ONCE AGAIN, THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER WILL ADDRESS A QUESTION OF GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE: IS IT POSSIBLE TO FORCE MEMBER STATES TO RESPECT THE UNION'S "FUNDAMENTAL VALUES"? IT WILL BEGIN BY LAYING OUT THREE OF THE MAIN MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS: THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS. THE RULE OF LAW MECHANISM AND ARTICLE 7 TEU. IT WILL THEN DEVELOP THE THESIS. LAID DOWN BY KELEMEN, OF THE UNION'S "AUTHORITARIAN EQUILIBRIUM". WHICH WILL SERVE TO EXPLAIN THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS' BEHAVIOUR. AFTER ANALYSING SEVERAL PROPOSALS FOR THE CONDITIONALITY OF THE RECOVERY FUND, NONE OF WHICH PRESENT MAJOR LEGAL OBSTACLES, IT WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS' INACTION, FACED WITH DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, IS NOT OWED TO A LACK OF LEGAL INSTRUMENTS OR OF COMPETENCES, BUT, FIRST AND FOREMOST, TO A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL.
451	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE THEORIES OF RUSSIAN PRE-REVOLUTIONARY STATE SCIENTISTS ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN MONOGRAPHS, DISSERTATIONS, PUBLICATIONS IN THE PERIODICAL LEGAL SCIENTIFIC PRESS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THE SUBJECT OF THE STUDY IS THE PATTERNS OF EVOLVEMENT, THE CONTENT FEATURES AND RESULTS OF RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN BY SCIENTISTS IN THE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF A RULE OF LAW. THE CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK IS COVERED BY THE PERIOD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY TO 1917, BECAUSE IN THE PRECEDING STAGES THE RULE OF LAW THEORY WAS NOT DEVELOPED BY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT SCIENTISTS ON A SERIOUS SCIENTIFIC BASIS. THE CONCLUSION ON THE QUALITATIVE SIDE OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED IN PREREVOLUTIONARY STUDIES THAT FORMED THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ESSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SCIENCE OF RUSSIAN STATE LAW OF THIS PERIOD WAS FORMULATED IN THE PAPER.
452	FOR THE SUSTAINABLE OVERCOMING OF ARMED VIOLENCE IN COLOMBIA, WITH OR WITHOUT NEGOTIATIONS, THE NOTION OF "POSITIVE PEACE" IS A MUST. MILITARY SUCCESS SHOWS ITS PRECARIOUSNESS BEFORE THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN A SETTING OF URGENT SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. DURING THE LAST DECADE, BOTH THE DEMOCRATIC SECURITY POLICY AND PLAN COLOMBIA HAVE PRIORITIZED THE STRENGTHENING OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF SECURITY, TERRITORIAL CONTROL AND MILITARY TOUGHNESS. OVERCOMING ARMED VIOLENCE IN TERMS OF ABSENCE OF CONFLICT IS THE WRONG CONCEPT BEHIND THE MENTIONED STRATEGY. ISSUES SUCH AS SOCIAL INEQUALITY, POVERTY, PARAPOLITICS, COLLUSION OF POLITICAL AND STATE SECTORS WITH DRUG TRAFFICKING AND ARMED GROUPS, PERSISTENT GUERRILLA VIOLENCE, INCREASING PARAMILITARISM, VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS (HR) AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW (IHL), AND FORCED DISPLACEMENT ARE PERSISTING CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME, BEYOND MERE SECURITY, IF WE ARE TO ASPIRE TO A TRUE REALIZATION OF PEACE IN COLOMBIA
453	THE ARTICLE FOCUSED ON PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS. THE ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, LEGAL BASIS FOR POSSIBLE EU ACTIVITIES AND COMPLIANCE OF EXISTING EU INSTRUMENTS WITH THE TREATIES. THE GOAL OF THE FIRST PART IS TO CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE RULE OF LAW AT EU LEVEL IS AN AUTONOMOUS CONCEPT. THE AIM OF THE SECOND PART IS TO CONFIRM THAT THE RULE OF LAW AS A VALUE HAS ITS EXPRESSION IN SUBSTANTIVE ARTICLE(S) OF THE TREATIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE THIRD PART IS TO CONFIRM LEGALITY OF EXISTING EU INSTRUMENTS.
454	IN RECENT YEARS THE EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN DIFFERENT STATES, SUCH AS ROMANIA, HUNGARY AND, MORE MARKEDLY, IN POLAND, REQUIRES A LEGAL AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ANSWERS THE EUROPEAN UNION IS PROVIDING IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS VALUES ON WHICH THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES ARE FOUNDED: THE RULE OF LAW. THIS RESEARCH APPROACHES THIS COMPLEX NOTION, FIRST, BY EXAMINING IT, THEN ANALYSING THE SITUATION IN DIFFERENT STATES THAT HAS CAUSED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE INADEQUACY OF CERTAIN MEASURES TAKEN AND THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE POLISH CASE, THE ILLEGAL REFORMS WERE ADOPTED ONCE THE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE PEACE AND JUSTICE PARTY (PIS) CAME INTO POWER IN THE 2015 ELECTIONS, AFFECTING THE FUNCTIONING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE GOVERNANCE OF THE PUBLIC BROADCAST MEDIA. THIS CONTEXT ALLOWS US TO REFLECT ON THE PREVENTION AND SANCTION MECHANISMS OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE TEU -THAT WITH THEIR DEMANDING THREHOLDS FOR ACTIVTION HAVE NEVER BEEN USED - AND THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK OR PRE-ART. 7 PROCEDURE ESTABLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AS A STRUCTURED DIALOGUE THAT IS BEING APPLIED TO THE POLISH CASE. THIS STUDY PLACES SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR THE EU TO USE THE DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS WITH FIRMNESS IN THOSE CASES WHERE SYSTEMATIC THREATS PUT IN DANGER A UNION THAT REQUIRES MUTUAL TRUST FOR ITS FUNCTIONING.
455	INDICATORS ARE WIDELY USED TOOLS FOR EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION-MAKING TODAY. YET, EVEN VERY SOPHISTICATED USERS OF INDICATORS OFTEN FORGET OR DELIBERATELY DISREGARD THEIR LIMITS. STRETCHING GOOD INDICATORS BEYOND THEIR INHERENT LIMITATIONS MAY LEAD TO INADEQUATE POLICY-MAKING. THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW SEVERAL WELL-KNOWN INDICATORS IN THE FIELD OF GOVERNANCE, JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE USED FOR POLICY-MAKING IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. IT BUILDS FROM YEARS OF FIELD OBSERVATION, DEBATE PARTICIPATION AND MEETINGS WITH POLITICIANS AND EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. DRAWING FROM TIME-TESTED SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH PRINCIPLES AND METHODS, THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH SUGGESTIONS ON THE ADEQUATE USE OF INDICATORS FOR PUBLIC POLICY DECISION MAKING IN THE BROAD POLICY AREA COVERED BY THE NEWLY ADOPTED UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL 16.
456	THE SCHOLARSHIP ON LEGITIMACY OF DISPUTE SETTLEMENT INSTITUTIONS HAS LARGELY IGNORED COMMUNITY MEDIATION INSTITUTIONS OPERATING IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO REMEDY THAT GAP, THROUGH A CASE STUDY OF COMMUNITY MEDIATION GROUPS IN SOUTH SUDAN, A STATE EMERGING FROM LARGE-SCALE CONFLICT WHERE FORMAL COURTS ARE ONLY MARGINALLY ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR ASSIGNED ROLES AND THE RULE OF LAW NEEDS TO BE BUILT ALMOST FROM THE GROUND-UP. THE ARTICLE STUDIES BOTH THE EMPIRICAL LEGITIMACY OF THE COMMUNITY MEDIATION GROUPS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE RULE OF LAW BUILDING PROJECT IN THE COUNTRY. IS THE EMPIRICAL LEGITIMACY OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT INSTITUTIONS AS A ZERO-SUM RELATIONSHIP, WHERE INCREASING POPULARITY AND USE OF INFORMAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT INSTITUTIONS DETRACT FROM THE POPULARITY AND EMPIRICAL LEGITIMACY OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, INHIBITING THE MATURATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND A RULE OF LAW? OR COULD INFORMAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT INSTITUTIONS - WITH PROPER LINKAGES TO THE FORMAL SYSTEM - STRENGTHEN FORMAL INSTITUTIONS, BOTH JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE? THESE ARE HIGHLY RELEVANT QUESTIONS FOR POST-CONFLICT STATES WHERE BUILDING A WELL-FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEM IS SEEN AS A PRECONDITION FOR SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT.
457	THE RHETORICAL FORCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ACKNOWLEDGED THROUGH OFFICIAL DISCOURSE IN MYANMAR JUST AS IT IS IN OTHER COUNTRIES ACROSS ASIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. GIVEN THAT MYANMAR MANIFESTLY DOES NOT CONFORM TO SUBSTANTIVE MODELS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES, MIGHT IT CONFORM TO A MINIMALIST ONE? IS THERE IN MYANMAR A THIN RULE OF LAW TO WHICH THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT CAN LAY CLAIM, ONE COMPATIBLE EVEN WITH GRAVE ABUSES OF HUMAN RIGHTS? OR IS THERE ONLY "UN-RULE OF LAW"? BEGINNING WITH SOME THEORETICAL CONCERNS, THIS ARTICLE PASSES BRIEFLY THROUGH A REVIEW OF LAW AND RULE-OF-LAW RHETORIC IN THE COUNTRY'S MODERN HISTORY BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE PRESENT DAY. IT RECOUNTS A COURT CASE ARISING FROM A RECENT HISTORIC EVENT, THE SEPTEMBER 2007 ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTS, TO QUERY WHETHER OR NOT A THIN RULE OF LAW CAN, IN MYANMAR AT LEAST, BE SAID TO COEXIST WITH AUTHORITARIAN RULE. IT CONCLUDES THAT IT CANNOT. BUT IF THE ARMY IN MYANMAR HAS SUCCEEDED IN OVERWHELMING THE COURTS AT COST OF THE RULE OF LAW, IRONICALLY IN DOING THIS IT MAY ALSO HAVE AVERTED A WORSE SCENARIO, ONE IN WHICH THE DENIAL OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOR WHICH IT IS WELL KNOWN COULD BE EVEN GREATER THAN AT PRESENT.
458	THE ORIGINS AND DEFINITION OF TYRANNY IN ANCIENT GREECE HAVE BEEN DEBATED IN SCHOLARSHIP FOR WELL OVER THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY. RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT TYRANNY AS A POLITICAL IDEA WAS NOT ANATHEMATISED UNTIL LATE AND THAT IN THE FIFTH CENTURY BCE AND BEFORE, TYRANNY COMPORTED NO NEGATIVE JUDGMENT. WHILE CORRECT TO POINT OUT THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 'KING' AND 'TYRANT' IN LITERATURE PREDATING ARISTOTLE WAS NOT CLEARLY DELINEATED, SCHOLARS HAVE OFTEN FAILED TO ASK THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF WHY THAT DISTINCTION WAS ESSENTIAL FOR ARISTOTLE. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT ARISTOTLE DREW UPON A MUCH OLDER INTELLECTUAL TRADITION WHICH SAW TYRANNY AS HATEFUL AND CONTRARY TO THE RULE OF LAW. THOUGH TYRANTS IN MANY CASES RULED LAWFULLY, A DISTINCTION MUST BE DRAWN BETWEEN 'LAWFUL' RULE, WHICH SOME BUT NOT ALL TYRANTS PRACTISED, AND THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH ANATHEMATISED TYRANNY.
459	THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF MINIMUM MONTHLY WAGE (SMMLV) IN COLOMBIA FOR THE 1983-2013 PERIOD, IN THE LIGHT OF THE IMPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM THE TRANSITION FROM THE SYSTEM OF A STATE OF LAW TO A RULE OF LAW, INTRODUCED BY THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION OF 1991 AND ITS IMMEDIATE PREDECESSOR IN WORK MATTERS: LAW 50 OF 1990. THE INSTITUTIONAL AND TECHNICAL PROFILE OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS REGARDING THE ANNUAL READJUSTMENT OF THE SMMLV WITH ITS CORRESPONDING RESULTS IS CHARACTERIZED FIRST. IN THE SECOND SECTION, THE SMMLV BEHAVIOR IS ANALYZED, COMPARED TO THE BEHAVIOR OF INFLATION. THE THIRD SECTION FOCUSES ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE PURCHASING POWER (LOST OR EARNED BY THE EMPLOYEES) IN THE PROCESS THROUGH AN INDICATOR BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE. A FEW CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY OBTAINED.
460	WE HAVE WITNESSED A SET OF LEGAL REFORMS IN POLAND THAT HAVE PROFOUNDLY TRANSFORMED ITS JUDICIAL SYSTEM. FIRST, THESE REFORMS HAVE NEUTRALIZED THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, TRANSFORMING IT INTO A BODY MADE UP OF A GROUP OF JUDGES WHO LEGITIMATE ANY CONTROVERSIAL LEGISLATIVE REFORM, AMONG THEM, THOSE RELATED TO JUSTICE. SECOND, THESE REFORMS HAVE BEEN AIMED AT TRANSFORMING THE JUDICIAL BRANCH INTO A MERE JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION THAT ACTS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER. THE SITUATION OF JUSTICE IN POLAND HAS PROVOKED THE REACTION OF DIFFERENT BODIES AND INSTITUTIONS. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABOUT THE BREACH OF THE RULE OF LAW BY THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND.
461	THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE WHY THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW DOES NOT COINCIDE WITH SOCIAL AND LEGAL PRACTICE AND WHAT KIND OF DEFORMATIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND PUBLIC LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS THIS ENGENDERS. METHODS: THE AUTHORS USED SYSTEMIC AND DIALECTICAL APPROACHES WHEN IDENTIFYING THE INDICATORS OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS DEFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTREMES OF THE ABSENCE OR EXALTATION OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW. RESULTS: THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED CULTURAL, POLITICAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS WEAKENING THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A RISK SOCIETY. THE PECULIARITY OF THE FORMATION OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN A RISK SOCIETY IS THAT IT EXPERIENCES THE INFLUENCE OF TWO GROUPS OF FACTORS. THE FIRST IS SOCIAL INSTABILITY CAUSED BY THE CONSEQUENCES OF GLOBALIZATION, TECHNIZATION, COMMERCIALIZATION, THE LAG OF LEGAL REGULATION OF RISK FROM THE AVALANCHE-LIKE SPREAD AND ESCALATION OF RISKS; THE FORMAL AND RELATIVE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN LEGAL AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR. CONCLUSION: THE IDENTIFIED FACTORS LIMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CREATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL ORDER, WHICH IS AN ADDITIONAL RISK FACTOR.
462	THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELATION BETWEEN POLITICAL OFFICE (ARCHE) AND THE RULE OF LAW IN PLATO'S DIALOGUE STATESMAN. TAKING ITS STARTING-POINT FROM AN OBSERVATION ABOUT THE STATESMAN'S PECULIAR APPROACH TO CONSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHAT PLATO IS CONCERNED TO SHOW IS HOW THE RECONCEPTUALISATION OF THE ROLE OF LAW IN GOVERNMENT PROPOSED IN THAT DIALOGUE HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT WE TAKE THE ROLE OF THE INSTITUTION OF OFFICE-HOLDING TO BE. WHILE GREEK POLITICAL TRADITION HELD THE MAIN AIM OF ARCHE TO BE THE FORMAL CIRCUMSCRIPTION AND CONTROL OF OFFICIAL POWER WITHIN A CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER, PLATO INSISTS THAT IT SHOULD PRIMARILY BE UNDERSTOOD AS ENSURING THAT THE EXERCISE OF POLITICAL POWER APPROXIMATES, BY MEANS OF LAW, THE IDEAL RULE BY A POLITICAL EXPERT. THE ARTICLE ENDS BY POINTING OUT HOW THIS READING COMPLEMENTS ANOTHER RECENT DISCUSSION OF OFFICE-HOLDING IN THE STATESMAN.
463	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES CONDITIONAL -CONVERGENCE AMONG THE LOW INCOME COUNTRIES USING A PANEL DATA FRAMEWORK COVERING THE PERIOD 1960 TO 2008. THE ESTIMATION OF CONDITIONAL INCOME CONVERGENCE IS BASED ON THE AUGMENTED SOLOW MODEL WITH SYSTEM GMM TECHNIQUE FOR THE DYNAMIC PANEL DATA. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE ARTICLE ASSESSES THE ROLE OF INITIAL HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INCOME CONVERGENCE OF POOR COUNTRIES BY CONSIDERING FURTHER CATEGORIZATIONS OF THE POOR COUNTRIES BASED ON THESE TWO VARIABLES. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY ON THE COMPARATIVE PROPERTIES OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE INCOME CONVERGENCE OF POOR COUNTRIES UTILIZING A DYNAMIC PANEL FRAMEWORK. THE FULL SAMPLE OF LOW INCOME COUNTRIES DOES NOT SHOW ANY EVIDENCE OF CONDITIONAL INCOME CONVERGENCE. THE CATEGORIZATIONS ON THE BASIS OF INITIAL HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK DO NOT ALTER THE CONCLUSION OF NO INCOME CONVERGENCE. HOWEVER, THE SUBSAMPLE OF LOW INCOME COUNTRIES WITH A BETTER RULE OF LAW EXHIBITS POSITIVE EVIDENCE OF CONVERGENCE TOWARDS THE STEADY STATES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THERE EXISTS A GREATER ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, THAN INITIAL HUMAN CAPITAL STOCK, IN THE INCOME CONVERGENCE OF POOR COUNTRIES AND VICE VERSA FOR THE HIGH AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES.
464	WHILE AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY IS CONSIDERED AN INDISPENSABLE COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ATTACKS OF THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL POWER ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ARE OBSERVED TODAY IN SEVERAL EUROPEAN STATES. THE EUROPEAN JUDGES (CJUE, ECTHR) APPEAR TO BE THE "LAST SOLDIER STANDING" IN THE DEFENSE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THEY HAVE IN NO CASE REMAINED INDIFFERENT. THIS CONTRIBUTION CONTAINS AN ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMIC APPROACHES THAT THE CJEU AND THE ECTHR HAVE ADOPTED IN ORDER TO REINFORCE THE GUARANTEES OF INDEPENDENCE THAT DOMESTIC JUDGES ENJOY UNDER EUROPEAN LAW (EU AND ECHR LAW). AN EMPHASIS IS PUT ON THE INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL FUNCTION OF THESE COURTS AS PROTECTIVE AND PROMOTING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, ARGUING THAT BOTH COURTS ASSUMED THEIR ROLE AS GUARANTORS OF THE COMMON EUROPEAN VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH A PROACTIVE STANCE, WITHOUT GOING, HOWEVER, TO THE EXTREMES. FURTHERMORE, THE PAPER PROVIDES AN EXAMINATION ON THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN COURTS HAVE ADOPTED MEASURES IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EUROPEAN GUARANTEES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. A PARTICULAR FOCUS IS PUT ON THE PROTECTION THROUGH INTERIM MEASURES AS A MEANS OF ASSURING AN EFFECTIVE PROTECTION OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF NATIONAL JUDGES. CONSIDERING A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE ISSUE OF THE ECTHR'S POTENTIAL IN THIS REGARD IS HEREBY TACKLED, NOTABLY AFTER THE RECENT EVOLUTION IN THE CASE-LAW OF THE CJEU.
465	THIS WORK PRESENTS A EXTENSIVE VIEW OF ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR, STUDYING THE INSTITUTIONAL AND STRATEGIC MECHANISMS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS, BUT ALSO INCORPORATING THE COGNITIVE AND NORMATIVE FACTORS TO THE EXPLANATION. THE ARGUMENT PROPOSED CLAIMS MAINLY THAT: 1) THE COMPARATIVE UTILITY OF COMPLYING/VIOLATING THE LAW INCLUDES, IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT COST OF THE PENALTY AND THE PROBABILITY OF BEING PUNISHED, OTHER INDIRECT COSTS THAT SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE PAY-OFFS OF OBEYING/DISOBEYING THE LAW; 2) WHEN THE PERCEIVED PROBABILITY OF BEING SANCTIONED IS LESS THAN A CRITICAL VALUE PC, THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT OTHERS WOULD DO AND THE VALUE OF THE CIVIC RULES TO THE INDIVIDUALS BECOME NON-MARGINAL FACTORS TO THE EXPLANATION; 3) WHEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO PERCEIVE THAT THE PROBABILITY OF BEING SANCTIONED IS LOWER THAN PC REACHES MORE THAN A CRITICAL MASS CD, IS MORE LIKELY THAT A WEAK RULE OF LAW EQUILIBRIUM IS ESTABLISHED; AND 4) IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE THIRD CONDITION IS SATISFIED, THE THICK MODEL OF ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR ACQUIRES MORE EXPLANATORY POWER.
466	"TRADE FACILITATION FOR THE ASEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY," READS THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE ASEAN SINGLE WINDOW (ASW). THIS MOVED CLOSER TO BECOMING REALITY ON 1 JANUARY 2018 WHEN FOUR OF THE SIX PILOT MEMBER STATES - SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA, INDONESIA AND VIETNAM, OFFICIALLY IMPLEMENTED THE USE OF THE SINGLE WINDOW'S FIRST FUNCTIONAL MODULE: THE ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE OF PREFERENTIAL CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL LAND- MARK OF AN OCCASION - ESPECIALLY GIVEN ASEAN'S REPUTATION AS AN INEFFECTIVE, DISINTEGRATED ALLIANCE. IT HAD BEEN WORK IN PROGRESS FOR SO LONG (THE PROTOCOL TO ESTABLISH THE ASW WAS SIGNED IN 2013, NEGOTIATIONS COMMENCED MUCH EARLIER) THAT SCEPTICS, NOT FEW TO BEGIN WITH, WERE INCREASINGLY DOUBTFUL OF SUCCESS. BUT IT HAS HAPPENED, WHICH GIVES THE MEMBER STATES A MUCH NEEDED BOOST IN CREDIBILITY THAT THEY WILL TAKE TRADE FACILITATION SERIOUSLY. THE TRUE TEST, HOWEVER, LIES AHEAD. INVESTORS AND BUSINESS OPERATORS CONTINUE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY INEFFICIENT CUSTOMS PROCEDURES AND WEAK RULE OF LAW WHICH ARE COSTING BUSINESSES EVEN MORE THAN DISCRIMINATORY TARIFFS. THE WTO'S 2015 WORLD TRADE REPORT ESTIMATED THAT THE TRADE FACILITATION AGREEMENT (TFA), IN WHICH MOST OF THE ASEAN MEMBER STATES ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING, WOULD CUT TRADE COSTS GLOBALLY BY BETWEEN 9% AND 21% WHEN IMPLEMENTED. BY GEOGRAPHY, THE SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN SINGAPORE LEANED IN THE 21% REGION. THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES THE RULE OF LAW TO BE A CRITICAL COMMON DENOMINATOR AND OFFERS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW MEMBER STATES MUST MAXIMISE THE INVOLVEMENT OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS, FROM CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, TO DEVELOP AND STRENGTHEN THE REGIONAL RULE OF LAW TO IN TURN OPTIMISE ASEAN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE SINGLE WINDOW AND TFA.
467	WE STUDY ATTITUDES TO LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA THROUGH ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS WITH LEGAL AND BUSINESS PROFESSIONALS CONDUCTED IN 2013-14, THE HIGH POINT OF THE STABILISATION OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY AND POLITY FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION OF THE 1990S. THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF OUR FIELDWORK BUT THE EFFECTS OF THE COOLING OF RELATIONS WITH THE WEST AND THE INTRODUCTION OF SANCTIONS WERE YET TO BE FELT. WE OBSERVED A PERCEPTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF CIVIL JUSTICE WAS NOT UNIFORMLY CORRUPT, BUT THAT IN 'POLITICAL' CASES, THAT IS, THOSE INVOLVING STATE OFFICIALS OR POWERFUL PRIVATE INTERESTS, JUDICIAL DECISIONS COULD IN EFFECT BE BOUGHT AND SOLD. THIS COMMODIFICATION OF CIVIL JUSTICE WAS THE RESULT OF AN EMPOWERED BUT PREDATORY STATE. WHILE THE STATE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO ENGAGE IN PREDATION, HOWEVER, IT WAS SEEN AS LACKING THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE THE ECONOMY IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY OR TO DELIVER ESSENTIAL PUBLIC GOODS. WE CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS FOR A CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN EMERGENT SOCIAL NORM. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE 1990S POLICY OF WEAKENING THE STATE THROUGH PRIVATISATION AND THE REMOVAL OF REGULATORY CONTROLS, A POLICY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMAND ECONOMY DID NOT RETURN, HAS LEFT RUSSIA WITH A DYSFUNCTIONAL PUBLIC ORDER, UNDER WHICH THE 'NORMALITY' ENVISAGED BY THE REFORMS OF THE 1990S IS A DISTANT PROSPECT.
468	THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HABERMAS' THEORY OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION AND THE CREATION OF PUBLIC OMBUDSMEN IN BRAZIL. THIS THEORY OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION, CONCEIVED BY HABERMAS, STATES THAT MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, PRODUCED BY DIALOGUE AND RATIONAL DISCOURSE, IS A WAY OF LEGITIMIZING THE LEGAL SYSTEM. IT IS ALSO OUR BELIEF THAT THE FORMATION OF MECHANISMS AND ENGINES FOR PUBLIC DEBATE IS FUNDAMENTAL IN DETERMINING THE LEGITIMACY AND VALIDITY OF ANY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN A SO CALLED 'FREE SOCIETY'. THE FOLLOWING IS A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF OUR CONVICTION THAT THE CREATION OF OMBUDSMEN IN BRAZIL CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THEORY OF COMMUNICATIVE ACTION AND THIS IDEA OF POPULAR PARTICIPATION IN BRAZIL'S RULE OF LAW.
469	THE POTENTIAL USE, RELEVANCE, AND APPLICATION OF AI AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS MAY BE OBVIOUS TO SOME. HOWEVER, TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND, EVEN, ITS CONSIDERATION MAY FACE AN INTUITIVE PUSH-BACK IN THE FORM OF ALGORITHM AVERSION (DIETVORST ET AL. J EXP PSYCHOL 144(1):114-126, 2015). IN THIS PAPER, I CONFRONT THIS INTUITION AND SUGGEST THAT A MORE 'EXTREME' FORM OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS DOES NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN A WORSE OUTCOME IN TERMS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. TO PROVOKE FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND ILLUSTRATE THAT INITIAL INTUITIONS REGARDING DEMOCRATIC INNOVATION MAY NOT ALWAYS BE ACCURATE, I POSE AND EXPLORE FOUR WAYS THAT AI AND OTHER FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY COULD BE USED TO AUGMENT THE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THE AUGMENTATIONS RANGE FROM VOTING ONLINE TO THE WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S HUMAN REPRESENTATIVES WITH ALGORITHMS. AFTER FIRST NOTING THE INTUITION THAT LESS INVASIVE FORMS OF AUGMENTED DEMOCRACY MAY BE LESS OBJECTIONABLE THAN MORE EXTREME FORMS, I GO ON TO CRITICALLY ASSESS WHETHER THE AUGMENTATION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS SATISFIES OR ENHANCES IDEAS ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW (PROVIDED BY DAHL AND FULLER). BY IMAGINING A (NOT TOO FAR-FETCHED) FUTURE IN A (NOT TOO FAR-REMOVED) DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY, MY CONCLUSION IS THAT, WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW, INTUITIONS REGARDING TECHNOLOGY MAY LEAD US ASTRAY.
470	THE ESCALATING NUMBER OF VIOLENT FEMALE HOMICIDES COMMITTED BY MEN OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES HAS COMPELLED MANY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES TO CLASSIFY (TYPIFY) THE CRIME OF GENDER-BASED HOMICIDE AS "FEMINICIDE" (OR "FEMICIDE"). THEIR OBJECTIVE WAS TO RAISE AWARENESS AND THEREBY DECREASE THE NUMBER OF FEMINICIDES COMMITTED PER YEAR. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF FEMINICIDE FELL IN MANY COUNTRIES, IT ROSE AGAIN IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. IN THIS STUDY, A DATASET WAS BUILT ON THE RATE OF FEMINICIDE BETWEEN 2000 AND 2014, AND AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF INFLUENCING FACTORS. THE CRIMI-NALISATION (TYPIFICATION) OF FEMINICIDE IS NOT FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANT TO PREDICT THE RATE OF FEMINICIDE. INSTEAD, LOW LEVELS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A LACK OF FEMALE REPRESENTATION IN DECISION-MAKING BODIES SUCH AS NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS ARE FOUND TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN FEMINICIDE TRENDS.
471	AS ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROTRACTED EU CRISIS AROUSED BY THE 2009 GREAT RECESSION -THE DEEPEST AND THE LONGEST EVER THROUGHOUT THE EUROPEAN PROCESS-, BOTH THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE WITNESSED A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS BACKLASHES. SINCE BOTH THE LISBON TREATY AND THE ECFR ENTERED INTO FORCE (DECEMBER 2009, THE EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE DEVELOPED NEW STRATEGIES TO REINFORCE AND STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO TEST MEMBER STATES LAW MAKING STANDARDS AS TO THEIR DUE RESPECT TO COMMON CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND PRINCIPLES, ENSHRINED IN ART. 2 TEU ("COPENHAGEN CRITERIA P). BY DOING THAT, THEY HAVE UNFOLDED AS WELL NEW INSTRUMENTS TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND CORRECT POTENTIAL RISK OF BACKWARD STEPS AT THE MEMBER STATES NATIONAL LEVEL, BE IT VIA CONSTITUTIONAL OR VIA LEGAL REFORMS. HUNGARY AND POLAND ARE PARAMOUNT CASES, IN AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE CALLED FOR: EXTRAJUDICIAL ACTIONS (RULE OF LAW MECHANISM); INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURES BY THE COMMISSION (ART.258 TFEU ), AND EP RESOLUTIONS CALLING BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL TO INITIATE ART. 7 TEU. THIS PAPER EXAMINES RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SPHERE OF RULE OF LAW, IN VIEW OF EXTENDING ITS SCOPE TO A NEW POLICY CYCLE ON RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, ENCOMPASSING OVERALL AND REGULAR SCRUTINY OF ALL OF THE MEMBER STATES BY MEANS OF OBJECTIVE INDICATORS, AS A WAY TO OVERCOME THE LIMITS (AND UNLIKELY OUTCOME) OF THE SO-CALLED "NUCLEAR OPTION" OF ART. 7 TEU. IT BUILDS ON THE PROPOSAL OF LINKING ACCESS TO EU FUNDS AND BUDGETARY BENEFITS WITH FULL COMPLIANCE WITH RULE OF LAW, DEMOCRACY AND RIGHTS EU STANDARDS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES MAINLY ON POLAND. IT ADDS TO AN OVERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF THE LATEST ECJ RULINGS ON POLISH JUDICIAL REFORMS LED BY THE FAR CONSERVATIVE RULING PARTY (PIS), DEEMED TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH EU LAW. IT ENDS WITH CONCLUSIVE REMARKS ON THE NEED ON THE NEED OF MAKING PROGRESS IN THE EUROPEAN PATH TO MULTILAYER CONSTITUTIONALISM AND BINDING EUROPEAN LAW ABOVE "NATIONAL IDENTITY".
472	THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS THE EXISTENCE OF A DEFICIT IN THE RULE OF LAW AS A BRAKING FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, MONTENEGRO, AND SERBIA (SEE COUNTRIES). THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO QUANTITATIVELY ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF FOUR INDEPENDENT VARIABLES ON THE BASIS OF A HYPOTHETICAL THEORETICAL APPROACH AND RELEVANT QUESTIONNAIRES: A) NEGATIVE IMPACT OF INSUFFICIENT SPECIFICATION AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS, AS WELL AS POOR CONTRACT PROTECTION, B) NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ALTERNATIVE INSTITUTIONS, SOCIAL PATHOLOGY AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE, C) NEGATIVE IMPACT OF OPPORTUNISTIC BEHAVIOUR (CORRUPTION, RENT-SEEKING, PRIVILEGES, CRIME, MANAGERIAL MALFEASANCE, AND MORE), AND D) NEGATIVE IMPACT OF DOMINATION OF POLITICS OVER THE ECONOMY (OR: NON-LIMITED GOVERNMENT POWERS) AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE, WHICH WE DEFINED AS THE "LEVEL OF DEFICIT OF THE RULE OF LAW". THE PAPER STARTS WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE FACTORS DEFINED BY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES DOMINANTLY INFLUENCE THE MANIFESTATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW DEFICIT AS A KEY DEVELOPMENT BOUNDARY. MULTIPLE REGRESSION LINEAR APPROACH WAS METHODOLOGICALLY APPLIED TO THE SAMPLE OF 270 SELECTED RESPONDENTS IN THE THREE OBSERVED COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS HAVE CONFIRMED THE VALIDITY OF THE HYPOTHESIS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL REFORMS IN THE PART OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, WHICH WOULD LEAD TO THE REDUCTION OF THE DEFICIT IN THE RULE OF LAW.
473	DIGITAL ECONOMY EMPOWERS THE FURTHER PURSUIT AND MATERIALIZATION OF THE BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE (BRI). IT HAS SOCIAL EFFICACY AND IS GOVERNANCE- ORIENTED IN THE PROCESS OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, BUT ALSO HAS MULTI-FACETED PREDICAMENTS OF GOVERNANCE AS WELL AS OBSTACLES TO THE RULE OF LAW. THEREFORE, THE BRI DIGITAL ECONOMY GOVERNANCE SHOULD MEDIATE FOUR RELATIONSHIPS AT THE MACRO LEVEL, AND IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW FROM THREE DIMENSIONS WITH THE PURPOSE OF CONTRIBUTING TO CONSTRUCTING GLOBAL DIGITAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM.
474	THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW IS IDENTIFIED AS A FACTOR THAT POTENTIALLY AFFECTS CHILD MORTALITY VIA CAUSAL MECHANISMS INDEPENDENT OF THE FISCAL SOCIOLOGY ASPECT OF STATE CAPACITY - STATE SIZE. TWO POTENTIAL CAUSAL MECHANISMS ARE PROPOSED THROUGH WHICH THE RULE OF LAW MAY AFFECT CHILD MORTALITY: BY IMPROVING MARKET EFFICIENCY AND SUPPORTING CIVIL SOCIETY. AS AN INITIAL TEST OF THESE PROPOSITIONS, A CROSS-NATIONAL TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF 93 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES EXAMINES WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON CHILD MORTALITY, INDEPENDENT OF THE SIZE OF THE STATE AND OTHER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTROLS. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED SUPPORTS THIS HYPOTHESIS AND SUGGESTS A STRONG, NEGATIVE AND ROBUST EFFECT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON CHILD MORTALITY, WHILE ALSO SUGGESTING THAT STATE SIZE DOES NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CHILD MORTALITY WHEN CONTROLLING FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER POLITICO-ECONOMIC VARIABLES.
475	THE PAPER FOCUSES FIRST ON THE CONCEPT OF "RULE OF LAW" AND ITS REQUIREMENTS. THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM ON THE RULE OF LAW IS ANALYZED IN DETAIL. THE LAST PART OF THE EXPOSITION CONCERNS THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF THE EUROPEAN BUDGET IN CASE OF VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW BY A MEMBER STATE. IN THIS REGARD, SOME JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE COMMENTED ON, GIVEN BY IT IN A FEW CASES INVOLVING HUNGARY AND POLAND, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ON THE OTHER PART. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE COMPLEXITY AND THE VERY SPECIAL IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW, ESSENTIAL VALUE EXPRESSIS VERB IS CONSECRATED, TO ANALYZE THE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IN THE FIELD EXISTING AT THE LEVEL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. FINALLY, THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE MEMBER STATES IN RESPECTING THE PRINCIPLE EXAMINED ARE HIGHLIGHTED; IN THIS RESPECT, SEVERAL JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE CONCERNING SYSTEMATIC INFRINGEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY SOME MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE ANALYZED. THE HISTORICAL AND THE COMPARATIVE METHODS ARE USED IN THIS PRESENTATION. THE ARTICLE IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE EUROPEAN UNION, TO THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD, BUT ESPECIALLY TO THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO TAKE OVER AND GIVE PRIORITY TO ITS SPECIFIC LEGISLATION BY JOINING THIS REGIONAL ORGANIZATION. ALTHOUGH POLAND AND HUNGARY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED FOR THE SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THEY HAVE NOT REMEDIED THEIR SITUATION, DESPITE THE SANCTIONS APPLIED.
476	CORRUPTION IS AN ENDEMIC SOCIETAL PROBLEM WITH PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONS. IN COMBATING THIS ISSUE, CROSS-NATIONAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW SEEMS AT ODDS WITH POORLY REALIZED OUTCOMES FROM REFORMS INSPIRED IN THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION FOR SUCH CONTRADICTION. BY BUILDING A COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH, WE DEVELOP THREE METHODOLOGICAL NOVELTIES INTO THE EMPIRICAL STUDY OF CORRUPTION: (1) MODELING GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE AS A MORE ADEQUATE INTERVENTION VARIABLE THAN TRADITIONAL INDICATORS, (2) GENERATING LARGE WITHIN-COUNTRY VARIATION BY MEANS OF BOTTOM-UP SIMULATIONS (INSTEAD OF CROSS-NATIONAL DATA POOLING), AND (2) ACCOUNTING FOR ALL POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COVARIATES THROUGH A SPILLOVER NETWORK. OUR ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT, THE LEAST DEVELOPED A COUNTRY IS, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIND THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF POLICIES THAT LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN CORRUPTION. WE CHARACTERIZE THIS DIFFICULTY THROUGH A RUGGED LANDSCAPE THAT GOVERNMENTS NAVIGATE WHEN CHANGING THE TOTAL BUDGET SIZE AND THE RELATIVE EXPENDITURE TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW. IMPORTANTLY OUR METHOD HELPS IDENTIFYING THE-COUNTRY-SPECIFIC-POLICY ISSUES THAT COMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION.
477	THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE INADEQUATELY EXPLORED EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON TOURISM FOR INDIAN STATES. IT INVESTIGATES HOW THE RULE OF LAW INFLUENCES FEDERAL BUDGETARY ALLOCATION FOR TOURISM AT THE STATE LEVEL. THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, THE IMPACT OF RULE OF LAW ON BUDGET ALLOCATION FOR THE STATES CAN BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IF THE PREVAILING RULE OF LAW AFFECTS TOURISM PROSPECTS. THE CENTRE CAN TRANSFER MORE FUNDS TO BOOST TOURISM AND INCOME IF STATE IS AFFECTED BY LOCAL UNREST, OR OFFER LESS SUPPORT TO PUSH STATE FOR MAINTAINING ORDER. EMPLOYING DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATES WE SHOW THAT SUCH ALLOCATION FOR TOURISM RESPONDS NEGATIVELY WHEN RULE OF LAW WORSENS IN A STATE. HOWEVER, THE ESTIMATED MARGINAL IMPACTS OF RULE OF LAW ON BUDGET ALLOCATION SHOW THAT THE DECLINE IN BUDGET ALLOCATION IS SMALLER FOR RICHER STATES. FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT RULE OF LAW AND BUDGETARY PROVISIONS FOR TOURISM ARE COMPLEMENTARY.
478	CAN THERE BE RULE OF LAW AT SEA? IN EXTENDING THE TRADITIONALLY TERRENE IDEAL SEAWARD, THERE ARE A RANGE OF CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTIES. THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE OUTLINED, AND A RECURRING THOUGHT PATTERN IS SET OUT THAT IS FOUND IN THE TRADITIONS OF THOUGHT ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AS PROTECTING MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER. DRAWING ON JEREMY BENTHAM'S SCATTERED REMARKS ABOUT MARITIME GOVERNANCE, THREE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THIS THOUGHT PATTERN, REGARDING TERRITORIALITY, COMMUNITY, AND PROTECTIVE FUNCTION, ARE IDENTIFIED AS REQUIRING MODIFICATION IN THE MARITIME CONTEXT. ACHIEVEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AT SEA IS POSSIBLE, BUT REFLECTS A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AS COMPARED TO ITS TERRENE COUNTERPART, LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THESE THREE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS.
479	IN RECENT YEARS, THE ACADEMIC FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL LAW HAS TAKEN A CLEAR 'CONSTITUTIONAL' TURN. IN THIS NORMATIVE ENDEAVOUR, LIBERAL 'RULE OF LAW' IDEALS ARE BEING REINVIGORATED, TRANSLATED AND PROJECTED ONTO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS ARTICLE TRADES THIS WELL-TRODDEN PATH FOR A SOCIO-LEGAL INQUIRY INTO HOW THE 'RULE OF LAW' IS PRODUCED, PRACTICED AND PERFORMED IN THE EVERYDAY POLITICAL AND OPERATIONAL LIFE OF ONE SPECIFIC INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION (THE WORLD BANK) DURING ONE CONTENTIOUS HISTORICAL EPISODE. TO GRASP WHAT IT MEANS FOR 'LAW TO RULE', I ARGUE, WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR ARCHIVES TO THE DAILY PRAXIS OF LEGALITY: THE ACTORS THAT EMBODY IT; THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT DRIVES IT; THE POLITICS THAT RELY ON IT; AND THE FRAGILE INSTITUTIONAL BALANCES THAT GIVE IT MEANING. GROUNDED IN THIS PRAGMATIST PERSPECTIVE, I RETRACE THE INTERVENTION OF LEGAL EXPERTISE DURING THE BANK'S TURN TO STATE REFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR. DESCENDING FROM PRINCIPLES TO PRACTICES, FROM NORMS TO ACTS, FROM ABSTRACT HEIGHTS TO SITUATED PERFORMANCES, THE ARTICLE NOT ONLY STRIVES FOR AN ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE 'RULE OF LAW' WITHIN THE WORLD BANK, BUT ALSO AIMS AT A CRITICAL METHODOLOGICAL INTERVENTION IN THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL LAW.
480	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE LEADERSHIP DIMENSIONS IN DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW. THE PAPER CONSIDERS THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS, WITH THE LEADERSHIP TENSION IS PRIMARILY SEEN FROM THE PRISM OF THE RULE OF LAW. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES IN SPECIFIC RECENT CASE STUDIES. FINDINGS THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IS A CULTURE SHIFT TOWARD RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS REQUIRED. THE PAPER NOTES THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING CONSENSUS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE CHALLENGE IS THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE OF LAW REFORM IS PRIMARILY A POLITICAL ENDEAVOR THAT AFFECTS THE BALANCE OF POWERS WITHIN THE STATE. THIS NEED FOR LEADERS TO DEVELOP THE SPACE FOR INSTITUTIONS ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IS MOST CERTAINLY THE CASE IN, AND EXACERBATED BY, CONFLICT AND POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS.
481	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS PLATO'S REPUBLIC AS A WORK ARGUING FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WHICH CONSTITUTE NOT - AS POPPER THOUGHT - A TOTALITARIAN STATE, BUT RATHER OUR OWN STATE, BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. PLATO IS TRYING TO DEVELOP HERE A NEW FORM OF 'ENLIGHTENMENT' (UNLIKE THE SO-CALLED 'SOPHISTIC ENLIGHTENMENT' HE CRITICIZES HERE) WHICH WE SHOULD SEE AS A 'REVITALISATION' OF TRADITIONAL POSITIONS, WHICH PLATO THINKS SHOULD BE REGENERATED ACCORDING TO RATIONAL PRINCIPLES.
482	THIS STUDY PRESENTS EVIDENCE ABOUT RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL CULTURE AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE OPERATIONALIZE CULTURE WITH DATA ON CULTURAL DIMENSIONS FOR SOME 50 NATIONS ADOPTED FROM CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY AND GENERATE TESTABLE HYPOTHESES ABOUT THREE BASIC SOCIAL NORMS OF GOVERNANCE: THE RULE OF LAW, CORRUPTION, AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE NORMS CORRELATE SYSTEMATICALLY AND STRONGLY WITH NATIONAL SCORES ON CULTURAL DIMENSIONS AND ALSO DIFFER ACROSS CULTURAL REGIONS OF THE WORLD. USING A LINGUISTIC VARIABLE ON PRONOUN DROP AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR CULTURAL EMPHASES ON AUTONOMY VERSUS EMBEDDEDNESS POINTS TO A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF CULTURE ON GOVERNANCE. USING CULTURAL PROFILES OF A PREVIOUS GENERATION AS AN INSTRUMENT INDICATES RELATIVE STABILITY OF CULTURAL ORIENTATIONS AND OF THEIR CORRELATES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS.
483	THE EUROPEAN 'MESSIANIC' PROJECT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH DEMOCRACY OR HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT RATHER SOUGHT 'LEGITIMACY' IN THE NOBILITY OF ITS CAUSE. HOWEVER, WHEN FAILURE STRUCK DURING THE EURO-CRISIS, MANY SOURCES OF LEGITIMACY SUDDENLY COLLAPSED. SIMILARLY, FAILURE STRUCK THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE, DEMONSTRATING ITS PRECARIOUSNESS AND WEAK SOURCE OF LEGITIMATION. THE STRONG WAVES OF DE-EUROPEANISATION AND THE RISE OF ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES NOT ONLY BOLSTER THE EXISTING PREOCCUPATIONS OF PROBLEMATIC DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES, BUT FURTHER BRING INTO QUESTION THE CONTINUITY OF THE EU AS A SUPRANATIONAL ENTITY. INTERESTINGLY, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S ANSWER TO THESE ISSUES FURNISHES A SOLUTION THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, FOCUSES ON THE ENHANCEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, WHILE FOCUSING THE SAFEGUARDING OF RULE OF LAW ON THE OTHER. SUCH AN ENHANCEMENT OF DEMOCRACY COULD BE THE RESULT OF THE CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE OF EUROPE, WHEREAS, THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS IS MEANT TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH FINANCIAL AND TECHNO-MANAGERIAL MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, IF THE FIRST MECHANISM AIMS TO PALLIATE OR EVEN MITIGATE THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT, THE SECOND ONE RISKS FURTHER ALIENATING UNION CITIZENS BY SEEING IN IT ANOTHER INSTANCE OF EUROPEAN UNION 'TECHNOCRACY'. THE SOLUTION TO BE FORESEEN IS TO RECONNECT DEMOCRACY WITH RULE OF LAW AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE FOREIGN IMPLANTS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. FILLING IN THESE EMPTY GAPS OF POLITICAL MESSIANISM THROUGH AN OUTRIGHT PAIRING OF DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW WILL REJUVENATE THE SOCIAL LEGITIMACY OF EUROPEAN EXCEPTIONALISM.
484	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE BALANCE BETWEEN SECURITY AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT CHARACTERISES EU CRIMINAL LAW AND EXAMINES HOW PROCESSES OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING HAVE RE-SHAPED IT. TRADITIONALLY, EU CRIMINAL LAW HAS BEEN CHARACTERISED BY ITS SECURITISATION, WHICH CRYSTALLISED IN THE PRIORITISATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF MUTUAL TRUST OVER CONCERNS FOR THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANTS. HOWEVER, PROCESSES OF RULE OF LAW BREAKDOWN AT MEMBER STATE LEVEL HAVE CHALLENGED THIS BALANCE AND DEMONSTRATED THE FLAWED FOUNDATIONS OF MUTUAL TRUST. THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW THE CJEU IS ADDRESSING THESE CONTRADICTIONS THROUGH CASE LAW THAT, NONETHELESS, CONTINUES TO PRIORITISE SECURITY OVER THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, WHILST MEMBER STATE COURTS CHALLENGE THESE INTERPRETATIONS AND DEVELOP DECENTRALISED INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. THE GOAL IS TO EVALUATE WHETHER JUDICIAL DIALOGUE PROVIDES AN ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK TO COUNTER THE SECURITISATION OF EU CRIMINAL LAW AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL IN THE MIDST OF A PROCESS OF RULE OF LAW BREAKDOWN.
485	WHY HAS THE EUROPEAN UNION'S (EU'S) PROMOTION OF RULE OF LAW (ROL) TRIGGERED DIFFERENT AND LARGELY SURFACE-THIN REFORMS ACROSS COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO A SIMILAR FRAME OF ENLARGEMENT IN THE WESTERN BALKANS (WB)? WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE DOMESTIC (NON-)ENFORCEMENT OF EU-PROMOTED RULES DEPENDS ON THE MOBILIZATION OF POLITICALLY AUTONOMOUS CONSTITUENCIES OF CHANGE - ORGANIZED ADVOCACY GROUPS AND AUTONOMOUS STATE INSTITUTIONS - WHICH ENABLE DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. THE EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON THE PROSECUTION OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION AS EMPIRICAL FOCI TO ASSESSING THE TRAVAILS OF EU-PROMOTED RULES IN THE DOMESTIC CONTEXT. SPECIFICALLY, WE TRACE THE ROLE OF (1) EU'S ROL PROMOTION STRATEGY, (2) POLITICAL RESISTANCE AND (3) DOMESTIC ACCOUNTABILITY IN EXPLAINING DIFFERENT RECORDS OF PROSECUTION OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION IN ALBANIA AND CROATIA.
486	THE EXISTENCE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY SOCIETY BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. IT SYMBOLIZES A COMMITMENT THAT THE EXECUTIVE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION MUST ACT WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW. ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN EVALUATE WHETHER A LEGAL SYSTEM CONFORMS TO THE RULE OF LAW. ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES REGULATE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE AND INDIVIDUALS OR LEGAL PERSONS, THUS CREATING RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, AND RESPONSIBILITIES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT INDIVIDUALS AND LEGAL ENTITIES HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAL AGAINST ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS WHICH AFFECT THEIR RIGHTS, FREEDOMS AND INTERESTS. HISTORICALLY, JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS HAS BEEN INSTITUTIONALLY SEPARATED WITHIN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF NORMATIVE SOLUTIONS GOVERNING JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THESE STANDARDS IN LIGHT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS PROPOSALS FOR THE REVISION OF CERTAIN SOLUTIONS. THE RELEVANT CASE LAW IS ALSO ANALYSED, SINCE THE LEGISLATOR OFTEN USES THE EXPERIENCE OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE. THE ADMINISTRATIVE COURT PRACTICE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA POINTS TO A NUMBER OF SHORTCOMINGS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONING OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE. THERE IS NON-COMPLIANCE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE REGULATION WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS, SUCH AS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF APPEAL AGAINST THE FIRST-INSTANCE COURT DECISION, THE LIMITED APPLICATION OF THE DISPUTE OF FULL JURISDICTION, VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND TO DISPUTE RESOLUTION WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.
487	THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT LAUNCHED BY THE KUOMINTANG GOVERNMENT AND ITS GOAL OF ACHIEVING THE RULE OF LAW BOTH AIMED AT BUILDING A MODERN IN CHINA. THE NATURE OF THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT WAS TO RULE BY VIRTUE WITH THE GOAL OF NURTURING THE PEOPLE AND BUILDING THE STATE. THE OUTLINE OF THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT, LEADERS OF KMT, AND THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE TIME ALL CONSIDERED, IN THEORY, OR EXPECT THAT THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT WOULD LAY A MORAL FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW THEREBY THE LAW COULD BE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY. THROUGH LEGAL ENFORCEMENT OF MORALITY, THE LAW PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN PROMOTING THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT. HOWEVER, THE LEGAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT IGNORED THE VITAL INTERESTS AND PRACTICAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, BLURRED THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THE PRIVATE DOMAIN, AND CAUSED UNNECESSARY INTERFERENCE WITH THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE. THE GOAL OF MILITARIZATION AND UNIFORMITY THAT THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT TRIED TO ACHIEVE HAD DEGRADED THE RULE OF VIRTUE INTO A GOVERNANCE BY "DISCIPLINE", AND MADE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO LAY THE PROPER MORAL FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AS A RESULT, THE COMPLEMENTARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW THAT PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED WAS NOT DEMONSTRATED IN PRACTICE. THE UNFINISHED PROJECT OF THE NEW LIFE MOVEMENT WAS LATER PRESENTED IN DIFFERENT PERIODS OF HISTORY AND REGIONS OF CHINA. NEVERTHELESS, IT HELPED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE RULE OF VIRTUE IN THE MODERN STATE-BUILDING.
488	THE PRESENT ARTICLE SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE PARTICULAR CULTURE THAT UNDERGIRDS THE PRACTICE OF EU LAW, BY DRAWING FROM PAUL KAHN'S CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF LAW. IT WILL DO SO BY EXTRACTING FROM HIS WORK CERTAIN MODELS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE IMAGINATIVE LIFE OF A POLITICAL COMMUNITY, MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF POLITICAL ACTION, WHICH IN KAHN'S OBSERVATION OF AMERICAN REALITIES STAND IN COMPETITION TO ONE ANOTHER. THIS WILL LEAD US, FIRST, TO CONSIDER THE PARTICULAR PLACE HELD BY EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, AS A MESSIANIC PROJECT OF COLLECTIVE TRANSFORMATION. WHILE THIS MIGHT SEEM TO STRUCTURE THE PRACTICE OF EU LAW IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH KAHN'S DESCRIPTION OF POLITICAL ACTION, SUCH A VIEW, WE WILL THEN SUBMIT, DOES NOT CONSIDER THE PARTICULAR PLACE OF LAW IN THE EU'S LEGAL CULTURE, AS THE VERY SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THE EUROPEAN ORDER APPEARS INCARNATED, AND WHICH PROVIDES THE IMPETUS FOR MUCH OF ITS DEVELOPMENT. TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE TWO DIMENSIONS IN THE POLITICAL IMAGINARY OF THE EU, IT IS ARGUED THAT, UNLIKE KAHN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE AMERICAN CONTEXT, THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL ACTION DO NOT STAND IN TENSION WITH ONE ANOTHER. INSTEAD, THE PRACTICE OF EU LAW OPERATES UNDER AN IDIOSYNCRATIC FRAME OF EXPERIENCE, WHICH CAN BE USEFULLY ASSOCIATED TO ROBERT COVER'S NOTION OF "LAWFUL MESSIANISM," AND WHICH SYNTHESIZES KEY ASPECTS OF KAHN'S ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL ACTION. FINALLY, TO ILLUSTRATE THE OPERATION OF JUST THAT CULTURE OF LAWFUL MESSIANISM AND ITS PERSISTENCE TO THIS DAY, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO THE PLACE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A "FOUNDATIONAL VALUE" OF THE EUROPEAN LEGAL SYSTEM AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THIS PARTICULAR NORM OF EU LAW.
489	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW BENCHMARKS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF KOSOVO THROUGH THEIR INTERNALIZATION INTO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE LEGAL BENCHMARKS ESTABLISHED IN THE RULE OF LAW CHECKLIST ADOPTED BY THE VENICE COMMISSION, WHICH, AMONG OTHERS, PROVIDES GUIDELINES ON THE EXTENT OF DELEGATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWERS FROM PARLIAMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A LEGAL ANALYSIS OF LEGAL MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT OF KOSOVO TO ENFORCE LEGAL BENCHMARKS OF THE RULE OF LAW CHECKLIST OF THE VENICE COMMISSION INTO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION. THIS HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE EVALUATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH ITS SUB-LEGAL ACTS WITH SPECIFIC LAWS AND ABROGATION OF SUB-LEGAL ACTS THAT LACKED SPECIFIC LEGAL AUTHORIZATION, AND THEREFORE DID NOT COMPLY WITH RULE OF LAW BENCHMARKS. OVERALL, THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO DEMONSTRATE THE DISTINCT PRACTICAL VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW ELEMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES, GIVEN THE INDISPENSABLE ROLE OF STABLE AND PREDICTABLE LEGAL PROCESSES IN THE FUNCTIONING OF INSTITUTIONS.
490	THE ARTICLE EXAMINES SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AS A MODERN LEGAL PHENOMENON AND LOOKS AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IDENTITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALISM. THE CONCEPTS OF "IDENTITY OF THE CONSTITUTION" AND "CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY" ARE DISTINGUISHED AND CONSTITUTIONAL MODELS OF HUMAN DIGNITY AS ELEMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY ARE ANALYZED, WHICH DEMONSTRATE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES TO CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION AND CONSTITUTIONAL POLICY IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE ARTICLE EXPOUNDS ON THE RULE OF LAW AS A UNIVERSAL VALUE AS WELL AS A CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL CONCEPT. THE ORIGIN OF THE DOCTRINE OF "RULE OF LAW" IS EXAMINED IN ADDITION TO THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS AND HISTORICAL ROOTS OF THE DOCTRINE AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN MODERN JURISPRUDENCE. THE AUTHOR ALSO CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING: DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW DOCTRINE; ITS INFLUENCE ON THE FORMS AND PRACTICE OF MODERN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY; THE PROSPECTS FOR CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FORMATION OF CONSTITUTIONALISM OF HUMAN DIGNITY; THE RELATIONSHIP AND INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY, ON THE ONE HAND, HUMAN DIGNITY AND THE RULE OF LAW, ON THE OTHER HAND; INFLUENTIAL FACTORS ON THE RULE OF LAW; CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE; THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE A UNIVERSAL VALUE IN THE PRACTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE; THE ONTOLOGICAL AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF COGNITIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE DIFFICULTIES OF IMPLEMENTING THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTS OF THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE ARE ALSO ANALYZED. THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF FORMS AND SUBJECTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY. IDENTITY, AS WELL AS THE RULE OF LAW, CANNOT BE BUILT ONLY IN CATEGORIES OF EXCLUSIVITY: BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIFIC FEATURES ARE FORMED IN THE SPACE OF THE DIALOGUE OF LAW, HISTORY, AND CULTURE.
491	THIS ARTICLE IS MAINLY FOCUSED IN THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY POWER IN THE RULE OF LAW. TAKING THIS AS A STARTING POINT, IT ANALYZES WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL REGULATION AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENTS ARE COMPATIBLES WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN THAT ANY JUDICIARY MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO REVIEW THE ACTS OF THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
492	SINCE 1995, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN JUSTICE REFORM INITIATIVES IN HAITI. THE RESULTS, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN MEAGER. DRAWING UPON DATA FROM A LONGITUDINAL STUDY CONDUCTED IN CITE SOLEIL BETWEEN 2008 AND 2011, THIS ARTICLE ILLUMINATES THE SHORT-SIGHTEDNESS OF TOP-DOWN REFORMS THAT FAIL TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE POPULATION, LEAVING THEM TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A VIABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM CITE SOLEIL RESIDENTS HAVE RESORTED TO ALTERNATIVE, AND AT TIMES PATHOLOGICAL, MEASURES TO EXACT SOME LEVEL OF "JUSTICE". IN THIS ARTICLE, WE CONTEND THAT AN EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED BASE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEMAND SIDE OF JUSTICE AND THE PROMOTION OF TRUST-BUILDING STRATEGIES THAT ENGAGE THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS IN THE COUNTRY ARE NECESSARY TO ENACT AND SUSTAIN JUSTICE AND RULE OF LAW REFORM. SUCH AN APPROACH WILL CREATE A VENUE TO CHANNEL CIVIL SOCIETY'S DEMANDS, BUILD POLITICAL WILL AND FACILITATE COORDINATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS AND HAITIAN SOCIETY FOR SELF-SUSTAINED RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS AND LONG-TERM PEACE BUILDING IN HAITI.
493	DEMOCRACY SEEMS TO BE VERY SICK, BUT IT HAS TO RESOLVE ITS ORIGINAL PARADOX. THE INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS AND THE "POPULIST ERA" REQUIRE A NEW DEFINITION OF WHAT IS DEMOCRACY AND WHICH ARE THE LIMITS OF POPULAR POWER. HOWEVER, THE HISTORICAL CONFLICT BETWEEN LIBERALISM (CONSTITUTIONALISM) AND DEMOCRACY (POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY), AS CHANTAL MOUFFE DECLARED, OUGHT TO BE TURNED DOWN. DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE TWO DIFFERENT AND ANTINOMIAN TRADITIONS: ON THE ONE HAND, THE LEGAL FACE AND ITS INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AS CONTROL OF POWER, GUARANTEES OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AND SUBJECTION OF CONSTITUTED POWERS UNDER ONE JURIDICAL ORDER; AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE POLITICAL SIDE AS IDENTITY BETWEEN RULER AND RULED, DEMOCRATIC PARADOX, AND PEOPLE-BUILDING AND ITS VOX POPULI VOX DEI. MOREOVER, IF WE WANT TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE, WE NEED TO REJECT THE MISTAKEN DOCTRINE OF SPANISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RULE OF LAW AND LEGITIMACY. THUS, THE DEFINITION OF DEMOCRACY MUST FIGHT AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE PEOPLE AS UNLIMITED WILL. DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS ALSO CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES AND STATE INTEGRATION WIDER THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND ITS LIMITS OF SOVEREIGNTY (IUS COGENS). IN SHORT, THE DEMOCRACY OUGHT TO BE ALSO UNDERSTOOD AS INTANGIBLE MEANING, OR -AS MERE MAJORITARIAN AND ELECTORAL POWER- THE TOTALITARIANISM WILL WIN THIS FINAL FIGHT.
494	ADOPTING THE METHODS OF INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS AND CASE LAW ANALYSIS, THE PAPER ANSWERS HOW SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IMPACT ADVOCACY FOR MINORITIES' RIGHTS' RECOGNITION. THE PHENOMENON IS ANALYSED IN THE CASE OF POLAND, A STATE THAT SINCE 2015 HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING DIRECTED EROSION ON RULE OF LAW STANDARDS. BETWEEN 2018 AND 2020, GOVERNMENTAL LEADERS IN POLAND TARGETED LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER (LGBT) PEOPLE IN THE CONTEXT OF ELECTORAL CAMPAIGNS. THE PAPER DISCUSSES LONG-TERM LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SUCH ANTI-LGBT CAMPAIGNS ARE POSSIBLE. IT FURTHER DEMONSTRATES THAT SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING, SUCH AS POLITICALLY SUBORDINATING THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL AND THE OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR GENERAL, ENABLE AUTHORITIES TO APPLY DISCRIMINATORY LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT THE TARGETED MINORITY'S RIGHTS AND ALSO MAKE RESISTANCE TO IT WITH LEGAL MEANS MORE COMPLEX. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS' IMMEDIATE RESPONSES-PRIVATE CIVIL LAWSUITS, ARTISTIC PROJECTS, AND MONITORING OF DISCRIMINATORY ACTIONS OF THE AUTHORITIES-WERE KEY FOR DRAWING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO ANTI- LGBT CAMPAIGNS, WHICH LATER LED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION'S INSTITUTIONS CONCRETE ACTIONS AND AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS' LEGAL ACTIONS. CUMULATIVELY, THESE ACTIONS CONTRIBUTED TO REVERSING ELEMENTS OF THE ANTI-LGBT CAMPAIGN IN POLAND.
495	AGAINST THE DOUBTS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE UNION AS REGARDS THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, ONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS VALUE HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION, SINCE ITS INCEPTION, AND THAT THE UNION SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROTECT IT WITH EFFECTIVE MEANS, TO PRESERVE ITS OWN INTEGRITY AS A UNION BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE UNDERSTANDING OF ARTICLE 7 TEU AS THE EXCLUSIVE PROCEDURE FOR THE PROTECTION OF FUN-DAMENTAL UNION VALUES IS INCORRECT. THE UNION CAN PROTECT ITS BUDGET THROUGH LEGIS-LATIVE MEASURES AGAINST THE IMPACT OR RISKS OF BREACHES OF THE RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CRISIS OF THE COMMUNITY METHOD AND THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL TENDENCIES OF THE UNION REMAIN IN TENSION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EFFECTIVE ACTION IN THIS FIELD.
496	THIS PAPER ANALYZES RECENT TRENDS OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). WHILE SOME SCHOLARS HIGHLIGHT THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AS THE KEY DEVELOPMENT AND PROBLEM, OTHERS FOCUS ON ELITE DISCOURSE AND PARTISAN COMPETITION. WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ESSENCE OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING BY ANALYZING CHANGES BETWEEN 1990 AND 2019 ON KEY INDICATORS OF DEMOCRACY - POLYARCHY, LIBERALISM, PARTICIPATION, DELIBERATION AND EGALITARIANISM - DOCUMENTED IN THE V-DEM DATASET, WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. WE FIND THAT DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING AT ITS CORE IS STRUCTURED BY A DETERIORATION OF THE QUALITY OF DELIBERATION. DELIBERATION IS ALSO THE COMPONENT WHERE EU MEMBER STATES DIFFER AMONGST EACH OTHER THE MOST AND WHICH HAS FEATURED THE GREATEST DETERIORATION IN RECENT YEARS. WE CONCLUDE BY SPELLING OUT THE IMPLICATIONS THIS HAS FOR EU POLICY.
497	SINCE THE SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION WAS SIGNED IN 1984 AND THE BRITISH COLONY OF HONG KONG BEGAN TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR REUNIFICATION WITH CHINA IN 1997, THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DETERIORATION OF STANDARDS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND OF CIVIL LIBERTIES IN HONG KONG AFTER THE HANDOVER. ONE OF THE CRUCIAL TESTS FOR WHETHER THE "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" MODEL PROPOSED BY CHINA WOULD WORK FOR HONG KONG IS WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE MAINTAINED IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION BY REVIEWING THE LEGAL HISTORY OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN 1997. IT FOCUSES ON WHAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS, CASES OR DEVELOPMENTS. IT DIVIDES THE LEGAL HISTORY OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION SO FAR INTO FOUR PERIODS. FOUR SECTIONS OF THIS ARTICLE DEAL THESE PERIODS RESPECTIVELY, FOLLOWED BY A CONCLUDING SECTION.
498	THIS ARTICLE WILL ANALYZE THE CONCEPTS OF RULE OF LAW AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, AND THE MANIFESTATION OF BOTH IN THE 2019 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CUBA, AND THE ONE-PARTY NATURE OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THIS COUNTRY. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE WORK HAS BEEN STRUCTURED INTO FOUR SECTIONS. THE FIRST HAS BEEN CONCEIVED AS A GENERAL INTRODUCTION, TO EXPOSE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT RULE OF LAW AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY. THEN, ARE ADDRESSED THE HISTORICAL-CONSTITUTIONAL EVOLUTION AND THE TENSIONS GENERATED BETWEEN THE ONE-PARTY CHARACTER OF THE CUBAN STATE AND THE AFOREMENTIONED PRINCIPLE, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CUBA (CPC) HAS BEEN PRIVILEGED FROM THE POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW, BY BEING RECOGNIZED AS THE SUPERIOR AND RULING FORCE OF SOCIETY AND THE STATE. IN THE THIRD SECTION, WILL BE ANALYZED THE CURRENT STATE OF THIS ISSUE, CONSIDERING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION OF CUBA AS A SOCIALIST STATE OF LAW, AS OF THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION. FINALLY, WILL BE MADE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED, CONSIDERING THE PREVALENCE OF THE CPC OVER THOSE STATE BODIES LINKED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH IN TURN CAN UNDERMINE THE NOTION OF A CONSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED SOCIALIST STATE OF LAW. THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO PLACE IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEBATE AN ISSUE LITTLE STUDIED BY CUBAN CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE, NAMELY, HOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEMOCRATIC QUALITY OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM, FROM ANALYZING THE TENSIONS BETWEEN CUBAN ONE-PARTY SYSTEM AND POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY, AS AN AXIOLOGICAL ELEMENT THAT SUPPORTS THE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION OF CITIZENS AND THE CONTROL OF POLITICAL POWER. THE CONCLUSIONS OBTAINED ALLOW US TO AFFIRM THAT THE DELIMITATION OF THE POWERS AND ATTRIBUTIONS OF THE CPC IS ESSENTIAL, GIVEN ITS CONDITION OF SUPERIOR POLITICAL FORCE, AND THE NECESSARY PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY IN A SOCIALIST STATE OF LAW.
499	SINCE THE 18TH NATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC) HELD IN 2012, XI JINPING, GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE CPC CENTRAL COMMITTEE, HAS MADE A SERIES OF VITAL EXPOSITIONS ON THE PROMOTION OF MODERNIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND CAPACITY IN LINE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE LAW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOL FOR GOVERNING A COUNTRY, AND THE RULE OF LAW SUPPORTS THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROCESS AND CAPACITY. PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW ON ALL FRONTS IS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR DEVELOPING SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROMOTING THE MODERNIZATION OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM AND CAPACITY. COMPREHENSIVE LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE IN ALL AREAS SHOULD BE PROMOTED TO ADVANCE THE MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL GOVERNANCE. FURTHERMORE, LAW-BASED THINKING AND METHODS SHOULD BE USED TO ADDRESS DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES FACED IN THIS MODERNIZATION PROCESS.
500	THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES CHINA'S PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE STRATEGY AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE RULE OF LAW, FOCUSING ON THE GUANGDONG PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE. VIEWED AS A NEW ROUND OF OPENING UP AND REFORMS, CHINA'S PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES ARE DESIGNED TO TEST RULES INCLUDED IN THE NEW ROUND OF REGIONAL NEGOTIATIONS OF INVESTMENT AND TRADE TREATIES. THE PRACTICES OF CHINA'S PILOT FREE TRADE ZONES ARE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW OF THE COUNTRY. THE GUANGDONG PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE HAS BEEN STRIVING TO DRAW ON EXPERIENCES FROM HONG KONG TO IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW HONG KONG LAWS AND LEGAL EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE GUANGDONG PILOT FREE TRADE ZONE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WILL AFFECT THE RULE OF LAW ON THE MAINLAND AND THE INTERREGIONAL CONFLICT OF LAW.
501	IN MEXICO, TO BE A CRIMINAL DOES NOT ALWAYS IMPLY TO BE SANCTIONED BECAUSE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES ARE INCAPABLE OF INVESTIGATING CRIMES. MOST OF THE TIMES THE INSTITUTION HAS SHOWN POWERLESS TO DEVELOP AN INVESTIGATION AND SOLVE CRIMES SUCH AS HOUSE ROBBERY, KIDNAPPING, FORCED DISAPPEARANCES OR MURDERING. IMPUNITY IN MEXICO IS HIGH AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT A RESPONSIBLE. NOT TO DO SO, PREVENT US FROM IDENTIFYING AND SOLVING THE PROBLEM. MANY ARE RESPONSIBLE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION: A) UNPROFESSIONAL POLICE OFFICERS, WHOSE BEHAVIOR DO NOT FAVOR AN EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION OF CRIMES; B) FEDERAL AND LOCAL PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICES WITHOUT MEMBERS WITH AN ADEQUATE PROFESSIONAL PROFILE; C) REPRESENTATIVES THAT DO NOT WANT TO LEGISLATE A SERIOUS REFORM TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM; AND D) POLITICAL PARTIES THAT DO NOT BAN THEIR MEMBERS WHEN THEY HAVE TIES WITH ORGANIZED CRIME. IN THIS ANALYSIS, I FOCUS ON ONE RESPONSIBLE: POLITICAL REPRESENTATIVES, IN PARTICULAR, THOSE IN CHARGE OF CHANGING THE RULES OF GAME OF THE PROSECUTION SERVICES IN MEXICO: LEGISLATORS AND THE EXECUTIVE. WHAT ACTIONS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO AVOID CASES SUCH AS AYOTZINAPA OR TLATLAYA? A DEEP REFORM TO THE PROSECUTION SERVICES NEEDS TO BE UNFOLDED IF WE WANT TO ACCOUNT WITH A PUBLIC PROSECUTORS THAT FOSTERS THE RULE OF LAW.
502	THE RULE OF LAW SERVES, UNDER A BROADLY ACCEPTED NOTION OF JUSTICE, THE ENFORCEMENT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A RELATIVE PREDICTABILITY OF CITIZEN AFFAIRS, I.E. IT FOSTERS PUBLIC VALUE. HOWEVER, IT IS SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MATERIALISE IN WEAKENED INSTITUTIONS, UNCERTAINTY AND TRANSACTION COSTS. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PUBLIC VALUE AND THE RULE OF LAW BECOMES SALIENT WHEN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE LATTER DEGENERATES AT THE EXPENSE OF THE FORMER. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES TWO THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT EXPLAIN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO CONCEPTS, AS WELL AS THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW'S DECAY. THESE COMPRISE THE EXCESS OF LEGAL-FORMALISM, THE EXCESS OF DISCRETION IN ENFORCEMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF THE LAW, I.E. WHEN IT EMBODIES INJUSTICE. ALTHOUGH THEY VARY DEPENDING ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM, THESE ASPECTS BUILD A CONCEPTUAL BODY THAT ILLUSTRATES HOW CONTINGENT LEGAL OUTCOMES AFFECT SOCIETY, DEVELOPING DALY'S (2019) CONCEPT OF DEMOCRATIC DECAY IN THE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS LITERATURE.
503	IN THIS STUDY, PANEL DATA, WHICH WERE OBTAINED FROM 36 COUNTRIES, ARE UTILIZED TO EMPIRICALLY EXPLORE THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY BEFORE REDISTRIBUTION THROUGH TAXES AND SOCIAL SECURITY. OUR ESTIMATIONS REVEAL THAT LEGAL ORIGIN INFLUENCES THE RESOLUTION OF THE PARADOX IN WHICH ECONOMIC INEQUALITY BEFORE REDISTRIBUTION IS HIGH, ALTHOUGH REDISTRIBUTION IS LOW. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE GINI COEFFICIENT BEFORE REDISTRIBUTION CAN BE LOWERED BY STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW IN COUNTRIES WITH ENGLISH LEGAL ORIGIN, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN COUNTRIES WITH OTHER LEGAL ORIGINS. IN COUNTRIES WITH FRENCH LEGAL ORIGINS, STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW WILL INCREASE THE REDISTRIBUTION FUNCTION. FURTHERMORE, THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE, CAN REDUCE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. THE RULE OF LAW EXHIBITS A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE, AND THE RATE OF SURPLUS VALUE EXHIBITS A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE RULE OF LAW AND CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE SYNERGISTICALLY REDUCE ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES. THUS, A WEAK RULE OF LAW, COUPLED WITH THE ABSENCE OF CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE, WILL PROMOTE MONETARY EASING POLICIES, WHICH FAVOURS POLITICIANS. MOREOVER, INAPPROPRIATE MONETARY EASING POLICIES WOULD INCREASE THE CONTROL OF COMPANIES OVER WORKERS AND PROMOTE EXPLOITATION.
504	THE RECENT DEMAND FOR NEW MEASURES OF THE RULE OF LAW CONFRONTS SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. THIS ARTICLE CALLS FOR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL SCIENCE IDEAS OF CONCEPTUALIZATION AND MEASUREMENT IN APPROACHING THE RULE OF LAW. EFFORTS TO MEASURE COMPLEX SOCIAL PHENOMENA SUCH AS THE RULE OF LAW ARE CHALLENGING, AND THUS REQUIRE THAT RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS PAY ATTENTION TO THE CAUTIONARY RULES OF SOCIAL SCIENCE IN THEIR EFFORTS. VIOLATING THESE BASIC RULES RISKS PRODUCING MEASURES THAT ARE NOT RELIABLE OR VALID, AND COULD BE A BAD BASIS FOR POLICYMAKING. THIS PAPER DEMONSTRATES SOME OF THE PITFALLS THAT RULE OF LAW RESEARCHERS HAVE FALLEN INTO AND SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASUREMENT APPROACHES.
505	DURING THE 2005 ELECTIONS IN EGYPT, NEWSPAPERS AROUND THE WORLD WIDELY REPORTED ON THE 'JUDGES' REVOLT'. THE JUDICIARY, SUPPORTED BY CIVIL SOCIETY, CONFRONTED THE EXECUTIVE BY DENOUNCING THE FRAUDULENT RESULTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM, AS WELL AS 2005 PRESIDENTIAL AND LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS. THE 'JUDGES' REVOLT' WAS A TEST CASE FOR EXTERNAL PROMOTERS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN EGYPT. FOLLOWING A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE EVENTS OF 2005 IN EGYPT AND THE CASE OF THE JUDGES' REVOLT, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR THE EU'S DIFFICULTIES IN PROMOTING RULE OF LAW IN EGYPT. THIS ARTICLE REVEALS THAT THE EU'S ACTION IN THE FIELD OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN EGYPT WAS CONSTRAINED BY TWO CATEGORIES OF FACTORS: 'EXOGENOUS FACTORS' RELATED TO THE EXTERNAL PROMOTERS OF RULE OF LAW ( THE EU, THE US) AND THEN 'ENDOGENOUS FACTORS' RELATED TO THE DOMESTIC CONTEXT. AT AN EXOGENOUS LEVEL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH THREE MAIN FACTORS INTERACTING WITH RULE OF LAW PROMOTION. FIRSTLY, THE EU'S INTERGOVERNMENTAL NATURE AS A FOREIGN POLICY ACTOR WEAKENS ITS POSITION AS A RULE OF LAW PROMOTER. SECONDLY, ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE ENP ACTION PLAN (EGYPTIAN-EU RELATIONSHIP) AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLT, COUPLED WITH A THIRD FACTOR (EGYPTIAN-US RELATIONSHIP), HAVE COMPELLED THE EU TO OPT FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TOWARDS PROMOTING RULE OF LAW IN EGYPT. THEN, AT AN ENDOGENOUS LEVEL, THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION BY THE EGYPTIAN REGIME OF EXTERNAL AID FUNDING IN THE FIELD OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIZATION COMPLICATES THE EU'S ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTRY, COMPELLING THE EU TO LOOK FOR STRATEGIES THAT BYPASS DOMESTIC CONSTRAINTS.
506	WHAT MORAL CLAIMS DO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS HAVE TO MEMBERSHIP? JOSEPH CARENS HAS ARGUED THAT ILLEGAL MIGRANTS WITH LONG-TERM RESIDENCE HAVE A CLAIM TO NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ARE DE FACTO MEMBERS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS ARTICLE BUILDS ON THE LINKAGE BETWEEN ILLEGALITY, RESIDENCE, AND RIGHTS, BUT SHIFTS THE FOCUS FROM THE MIGRANT TO THE STATE, AND FROM MEMBERSHIP-BASED ARGUMENTS TO THE RULE OF LAW. I ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW, AS EXPRESSED IN THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE REGULARIZATION OF RESIDENT UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS. THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE LONG-TERM PLANS FOR THEIR LIVES BY REQUIRING THAT STATE ACTION BE REASONABLY PREDICTABLE AND NONARBITRARY. THUS, AS AN EXPRESSION OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CODES HAVE STATUTES OF LIMITATION THAT PLACE A TIME LIMIT BEYOND WHICH MOST CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS CAN NO LONGER BE PROSECUTED, AND INDIVIDUALS CAN MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. NOT ONLY DO THESE STATUTES RECOGNIZE THE INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM ARBITRARY STATE CONTROL, THEY ALSO DEMAND THAT THE STATE CUT ITS LOSSES AND ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS FAILURE TO ACT IN A TIMELY MANNER. I CONTEND THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATION ON ILLEGAL ENTRY, THE DEPORTATION OF SETTLED MIGRANTS CONSTITUTES AN ARBITRARY ACT OF STATE POWER. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL RULINGS TO ILLUSTRATE THE ARGUMENT'S NORMATIVE LOGIC.
507	CRITICS CHALLENGE INTERNATIONAL COURTS FOR THEIR INTERFERENCE WITH DOMESTIC DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES AND ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF RULE OF LAW STANDARDS: THEY CLAIM THAT THESE GUARDIANS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE NOT WELL GUARDED THEMSELVES. THESE CONCERNS SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED TOO QUICKLY AS MERE DISGRUNTLED VENTING BY POPULIST POLITICIANS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS AND ARGUES THAT THE SAME INTERESTS AND VALUES THAT JUSTIFY RULE OF LAW STANDARDS OF IMPARTIALITY, INDEPENDENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY DOMESTICALLY ALSO JUSTIFY SIMILAR STANDARDS FOR INTERNATIONAL COURTS. FOCUSING ON THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND ITS DOCTRINE OF THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION, THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES HOW THIS DOCTRINE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO FULFILLING THE RULE OF LAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAY ALSO ENDANGER IT. THIS REQUIRES CHANGES TO THE DOCTRINE TO ENSURE THAT THE CORE RULE OF LAW STANDARDS OF PREDICTABILITY AND PROTECTION AGAINST ARBITRARY DISCRETION ARE RESPECTED.
508	LANGUAGE IS MUCH MORE THAN A SIMPLE TOOL OF COMMUNICATION; IT IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF GROUP IDENTITY. NATIONS, ETHNIC GROUPS, CULTURES ARE HARDLY IMAGINABLE WITHOUT A COMMON LANGUAGE. IN A MULTIETHNIC COUNTRY BY CHOOSING ONE "OFFICIAL LANGUAGE" THE STATE IN MANY RESPECTS FAVOURS THE USERS OF THAT LANGUAGE AND DISCRIMINATES THOSE CITIZENS WHOSE MOTHER TONGUE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE. THE REAL AND DEMANDING ISSUE IS HOW TO OBEY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CASE OF THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IN A MULTIETHNIC STATE. SERBIA, AND ITS UNIQUELY MULTIETHNIC VOJVODINA PROVINCE, HAS A RICH AND DEVELOPED LEGISLATION CONCERNING OFFICIAL LANGUAGE USE, INCLUDING THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE USE OF MINORITIES. ALTHOUGH, THE CONSTITUTION AND ACTUAL LEGISLATION RENDER THE SERB LANGUAGE AS THE PRIMARY OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY, MINORITY LANGUAGES COULD BE OFFICIALLY USED AS WELL IN AREAS INHABITED BY MINORITY POPULATIONS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXISTING SHORTCOMINGS OF THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS VIOLATED MUCH MORE BY THE ACTUAL PRACTICE AND POOR IMPLEMENTATION OF RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS. FACT AND FIGURES PROVE THAT MANY LANGUAGE RIGHTS ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF HUMAN RESOURCES, EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE FIELD OF IMPLEMENTATION OF MINORITY LANGUAGE RIGHTS IT IS NECESSARY BOTH TO MODIFY AND HARMONISE THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION AND ALSO TO PUT INTO EFFECT ORGANISATIONAL, EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES WHICH CAN MAKE THE RULES A LIVING PRACTICE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN VARIOUS MINORITY LANGUAGES AND VARIOUS INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS AND TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ACTUAL NEEDS OF MINORITIES, THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SO-CALLED ACQUIRED LANGUAGE RIGHTS.
509	THE RULE OF LAW EMBODIES TWO BASIC METAPHORS: THE TOOL AND THE CAUSEWAY. UNDER THE TOOL METAPHOR, THE RULE OF LAW IS APPLIED MORE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER, WHILE IN THE CAUSEWAY METAPHOR, THE LAW EMPHASIZES A FORM OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIETY WHERE "GROUND RULES" ARE ESTABLISHED, NOT JUST FOR ELECTORAL POLITICS BUT FOR THE DAILY TRANSACTIONS AND COMMERCIAL NECESSITIES OF INDIVIDUALS. THE CHOICE BETWEEN THESE TWO METAPHORS HAS ALWAYS BEEN CRUCIAL FOR THE LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC STATES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN MANY AFRICAN STATES, THE RULE OF LAW IS PRESENTLY USED AS A TOOL, AND CONTENDS THAT IF THIS SUPERFICIAL PERCEPTION IS DISCARDED, IN FAVOUR OF CONCENTRATING INSTEAD ON THE MORE EXPANSIVE CAUSEWAY METAPHOR, THE CONTINENT WILL STAND THE CHANCE OF BUILDING MORE MODERN DEMOCRATIC STATES THAT CAN COMPARE FAVOURABLY WITH OTHER CONSOLIDATED DEMOCRACIES ACROSS THE GLOBE.
510	THE AIM OF THE PAPER WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF POLITICAL STABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ON THE PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL IN 40 ECONOMIES OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IN THE YEARS 1996-2014. PANEL REGRESSION MODELS WITH TOTAL FACTOR PRODUCTIVITY (TFP) AS A DEPENDENT VARIABLE WERE APPLIED. IN ADDITION, QUANTILE REGRESSION METHOD WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE CHANGING NATURE OF THIS INFLUENCE DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL ACHIEVED BY A GIVEN COUNTRY. THE MAIN SOURCES OF DATA WERE WORLD BANK DATABASES (WORLD GOVERNANCE INDICATORS AND WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS) AND THE PENN WORLD TABLE DATABASE. ON THE BASIS OF EMPIRICAL ANALYSES, IT WAS FOUND THAT INCREASING POLITICAL STABILITY AND STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW HAD AN IMPACT ON PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN THE ANALYSED COUNTRIES, WITH THE LATTER FACTOR PLAYING A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE. MOREOVER, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE IMPACT OF ELEMENTS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT CHANGES DEPENDING ON THE ESTIMATED TFP LEVEL IN A GIVEN ECONOMY. WHILE IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES THE INFLUENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS MORE IMPORTANT, AS THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ECONOMY INCREASES, POLITICAL STABILITY BECOMES RELATIVELY MORE SALIENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE LEVEL OF HUMAN CAPITAL WAS CONDUCIVE TO THE GROWTH OF TFPS IN THE ANALYSED COUNTRIES, REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT.
511	THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN POLAND AND HUNGARY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A GROWING SENSE THAT THE COMMON VALUES OF THE EUROPEAN POLITY ARE BEING RADICALLY CHALLENGED AND, IN SOME CONTEXTS, UTTERLY DISMANTLED. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE HAVE REACTED TO THE CRISIS E.G. THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE VENICE COMMISSION AND THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK, WHILE SCHOLARSHIP HAS CONDUCTED AN INTENSE DEBATE ON THE CONDUCT OF FIDESZ AND PIS AND THE POTENTIAL MEANS TO STRENGTHEN LIBERAL DEMOCRACY VIS-A-VIS THESE PARTIES. THIS ARTICLE SHARES THE CONCERNS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL AND SCHOLARLY CRITIQUE OF FIDESZ AND PIS SINCE THE EU CANNOT RELINQUISH THE IDEAL OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND THE QUESTION OF THE MEMBER STATES' INSTITUTIONAL COMMONALITY. STILL, THE ARTICLE DRAWS ATTENTION TO A MATTER THAT HAS THUS FAR BEEN NEGLECTED IN THE MAINSTREAM DEBATE ON HUNGARY AND POLAND, THAT IS THE QUESTION OF THE AMBIVALENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY NARRATIVE AS DEPLOYED BY EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS. TO SOME EXTENT, IT IS PRECISELY THE FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE ITS OWN AMBIGUITIES, BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL, THAT MAKES LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC DISCOURSE A HOMOGENEOUS AND EASY TARGET VULNERABLE TO RHETORICAL ATTACKS BY RADICAL NATIONALIST PARTIES.
512	THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IS CENTRAL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CONCEPTION OF ITSELF, AND STANDS AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLITICAL CRITERIA OF THE ENLARGEMENT PROCESS. SOME CLARIFICATION OF THIS CORE CONCEPT IS ESSENTIAL IF IT IS TO PLAY A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN ENLARGEMENT AND, INDEED, IF WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE CRITERION IS SUBSTANTIVE OR MERELY RHETORICAL. IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT PURPOSE MUST THE RULE OF LAW SERVE WITHIN A STATE, BEYOND THE RATHER TRITE BELIEFS THAT THE LAW RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALS RULE, AND THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, IF A STATE IS TO BE ADMITTED TO THE EUROPEAN UNION OF STATES? I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT ITS PRINCIPAL PURPOSE HAS BEEN TO GUARD AGAINST ARBITRARY RULE, AND IF THE RULE OF LAW IS TO BE A SUBSTANTIVE CRITERION FOR EXPANSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IT MUST BE COGNIZANT OF WHAT THE CRITERION ENTAILS, AND FACE UP TO THE IMPLICATIONS FOR ADMITTING STATES WITH CULTURES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW HAS NOT FEATURED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THEIR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPES. THE ARTICLE LOOKS AT ONE OF THE MOST SOPHISTICATED ATTEMPTS TO DELINEATE THE IDEAL CHARACTER OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RECENT PHILOSOPHY, NAMELY THAT OF MICHAEL OAKESHOTT, TO CLARIFY THE MEANING THAT IT HAS IN ITS USE IN MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY AND IN RELATION TO THE MODERN EUROPEAN STATE.
513	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF RULE OF LAW AND GOVERNMENT SIZE UNDER THE DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM TO THE SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY OF MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS) FROM THAILAND, PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, AND CAMBODIA 2011 TO 2018. THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) APPROACH HAS BEEN APPLIED TO IDENTIFY THE EFFICIENCY LEVEL OF MFIS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE POOLED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (POOLS) AND GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARE (GELS) METHODS COMPRISING THE FIXED EFFECT (FEMOD) AND RANDOM EFFECT (REMOD) MODELS ARE USED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND POTENTIAL DETERMINANTS ON THE EFFICIENCY LEVEL OF MFIS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE TECHNICAL EFFICIENCIES FOR BOTH SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY ARE CONTAMINATED BY MANAGERIAL INEFFICIENCY, WHICH IS MEASURED BY PURE TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY. THIS INDICATES, ALTHOUGH THE MFIS HAD BEEN OPERATING ON A RELATIVELY OPTIMAL SCALE, THEY WERE FACING THE INEFFICIENCY FROM THE MANAGERIAL SIDE. BESIDES, THE RESULTS FROM THE PANEL REGRESSION ANALYSIS HAVE IMPLIED THAT BOTH PROPERTY RIGHTS AND GOVERNMENT INTEGRITY UNDER THE MEASUREMENT OF RULE OF LAW POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE MFIS' FINANCIAL EFFICIENCY. MEANWHILE, THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT SIZE SHOWS BOTH TAX BURDEN AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING ARE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE TO THE SOCIAL EFFICIENCY OF MFIS. AS THE POLICY IMPLICATION, THE INFORMATION PROVIDES SUGGESTION TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HOW ITS ROLE CAN HELP IN IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY LEVEL OF MFIS AND IMPLEMENTS SOME USEFUL INITIATIVES TO HELP MFIS TO SUSTAIN IN THE LONG TERM. IN ADDITION TO THAT POLICYMAKERS CAN IDENTIFY THE RELEVANT INPUTS OF MFIS AND THUS REVISE THE POLICY ACCORDINGLY AND DESIGN NEW POLICIES AND REGULATIONS BASED ON DIFFERENT ECONOMIC FREEDOM DIMENSIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDE A REFERENCE TO GUIDE THEM IN DECISION MAKING ON THEIR INVESTMENTS. FOR ACADEMICIANS OR RESEARCHERS, THEY CAN OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EFFICIENCY OF MFIS THAT IS VALUABLE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH OR STUDY.
514	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF FORMAL RULES SUCH AS BUSINESS REGULATION AND RULE OF LAW ON THE LEVEL OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA COUNTRIES OVER TIME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS USE THE PANEL REGRESSION TECHNIQUES TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF BUSINESS REGULATION AND RULE OF LAW ON FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN PARTICULAR, THEY IMPLEMENT TOGETHER TWO ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUGGESTED IN THE LITERATURE: THE "DUAL" AND "LEGALISTIC" VIEW. AT THE EMPIRICAL LEVEL, THE "DUAL" DEFINITION CORRESPONDS TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS' RATE. AS FOR THE "LEGAL" DEFINITION, IT CORRESPONDS TO THE BUSINESS REGISTRATION RATE. THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IS BASED ON TWO PANELS. THE FIRST PANEL COVERS THE PERIOD 2004-2015, AND THE DATA SET CONTAINS 180 OBSERVATIONS IN 18 COUNTRIES. THE SECOND PANEL COVERS THE PERIOD 2006-2015, AND THE DATA SET CONTAINS 134 OBSERVATIONS IN 14 COUNTRIES. FINDINGS THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONAL VARIABLES ON FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITION EMPLOYED: "DUAL" OR "LEGAL." THUS, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BUSINESS OWNERS' RATE IS MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE WEAK PROPERTY RIGHTS. CONVERSELY, FROM A LEGAL DEFINITION, THE BUSINESS REGISTRATION RATE IS MORE SIGNIFICANT IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE MOST SECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND FEWER LABOR REGULATIONS. THESE CONTRADICTORY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, BUT NOT THE DUAL DEFINITION, SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TYPE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY THAT PROMOTES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONDUCTING ANALYZES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PRESENT IN AN ECONOMY, AND IN ADDITION THE RELEVANCE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT EACH MEASURE IS CAPTURING OF THE HETEROGENEOUS PHENOMENON OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP POLICY SHOULD FOCUS ON THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, RATHER THAN MERELY SEEKING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NEW BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LEGALISTIC DEFINITION OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST RELEVANT FOR MANY POLICY ISSUES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER ANALYZES TOGETHER TWO ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF FORMAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUGGESTED IN THE LITERATURE: THE "DUAL" AND "LEGALISTIC" VIEWS. ALSO, THE PAPER HAS USED THE LATINOBAROMETRO DATA SET, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED BY SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND WHICH COULD BE USEFUL FOR LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH ON ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.
515	CHRISTIAN THOMASIUS WAS ABOVE ALL A PROFESSOR OF JURISPRUDENCE WHO USED HIS LEGAL SKILLS TO RESOLVE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND MORAL PROBLEMS. IN THIS ARTICLE WE REVIEW TWO OF HIS WRITINGS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HIS REARTICULATION OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICS IN EARLY MODERNITY. HE USED THE ELEMENTS OF WHAT LATER BECAME THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW TO DEFEND DENIS VEIRAS, AUTHOR OF THE HISTOIRE DES SEVARAMBES, AGAINST CHARGES OF ATHEISM. HE ALSO DEFENDED THE SKEPTICAL JURISPRUDENCE OF GEORG HEBER AS THE BEST INSTRUMENT FOR SEPARATING CHURCH AND STATE AND ASSIGNING EACH THEIR PROPER ROLES, AND MADE USE OF THEOLOGICAL SKEPTICISM TO JUSTIFY EXCLUDING THE THEOLOGIANS FROM POLITICS AND LIMIT THE INTERVENTIONS OF PRINCES INTO RELIGIOUS MATTERS EXCEPT IN CASES WHERE THE PEACE OF THE STATE WAS ENDANGERED.
516	THE RULE OF LAW HAS GAINED GLOBAL APPEAL AND RECOGNITION, AND IS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES UPON WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS BASED, AS SET OUT IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION. IN SECT. 1, WE BRIEFLY CONSIDER THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR THOSE DEFINITIONS USED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EU, THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE UNITED NATIONS (UN). WHILST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE NATIONAL DIFFERENCES AMONG EU MEMBER STATES, THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS AROUND THE CORE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THESE DEFINITIONAL ISSUES HELP FRAME THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS ON MEASURING THE RULE OF LAW. IN SECT. 2, WE OUTLINE SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE RATIONALE FOR MEASURING THE RULE OF LAW, FOLLOWED BY SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF MEASUREMENT TOOLS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE (E.G., THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOR THE EFFICIENCY OF JUSTICE (CEPEJ) TOOLS ON EVALUATING THE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF EUROPEAN JUDICIAL SYSTEMS, AND THE VENICE COMMISSION RULE OF LAW CHECKLIST); THE EU (E.G., THE EU JUSTICE SCOREBOARD, THE SPECIAL EUROBAROMETER ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE RULE OF LAW REPORT); AND THE UN (E.G., THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS). IN SECT. 3, WE CONSIDER CURRENT RULE OF LAW TRENDS IN LIGHT OF RESULTS FROM A RANGE OF DATASETS (INCLUDING THE VARIETIES OF DEMOCRACY (V-DEM) INDICES, THE DEMOCRACY BAROMETER, THE BERTELSMANN STIFTUNG'S TRANSFORMATION INDEX (BTI), AND THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT'S RULE OF LAW INDEX).
517	THIS WORK EVALUATES, FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE, THE DOCTRINE OF THE INTER -AMERICAN STANDARDS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. BY DEVELOPING THIS DOCTRINE, BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE IMPOSED STANDARDS OF CONDUCT ON STATES WHICH ARE NOT EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED BY CONVENTIONAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CONTROVERSY EXISTING AROUND THE DOCTRINE OF STANDARDS DEMONSTRATES IMPORTANT PROBLEMS OF PROMULGATION WHOSE "ACCUMULATIVE" EFFECTS LIMITS THE REALIZATION OF OTHER RULE OF LAW REQUIRE-MENTS. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE SUFFICIENTLY CRITICAL TO REVISIT THE SCOPE OF THE DOCTRINE OF INTER-AMERICAN STANDARDS.
518	THIS STUDY PROVIDES A RIGHT-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ARMED CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION IMPLEMENTATION PRACTICES IN RWANDA. IT ANSWERS THE MODE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ICTR AND THE GACACA COURT SYSTEM AND ASSESSED THE CONSISTENCY OF THESE MECHANISMS WITH HRBA PRINCIPLES USING A QUALITATIVE-CONTENT APPROACH. THE STUDY REVEALED THE CONSISTENCY OF ICTR OPERATIONS WITH THE HRBA PRINCIPLE ON THE RULE OF LAW; YET, THE GACACA COURT SYSTEM APPEARED THE OPPOSITE. THEREFORE, THE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND STRENGTHEN SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW MECHANISMS TO PROSECUTE RESPECTIVE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMANITARIAN LAW VIOLATIONS TO REDUCE CLASHES. THE STUDY RECOMMENDS SANCTIONS BE APPLIED TO ALL PERPETRATORS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LEVEL OF PERPETRATION.
519	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY HAS ADOPTED A UNIQUE UNDERSTANDING OF LAW. UNLIKE THE LIBERAL VIEW AND THE UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION VIEW, WHICH GENERALLY CONSIDER LAW AS POSITIVE NORMS THAT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF POLITICS, THE PARTY UNDERSTANDS LAW AS A REFLECTION OF THE PARTY'S AND THE PEOPLE'S WILL AND A FORM OF THE PARTY'S AND THE PEOPLE'S SELF-DISCIPLINE. IN THE PARTY'S VIEW, LIBERAL RULE OF LAW THEORIES ARE SELF-CONTRADICTORY, ILLUSIVE, AND MEANINGLESS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PARTY VIEWS THE PEOPLE AS A POLITICAL CONCEPT AND ITSELF AS A POLITICAL LEADING PARTY, MARKING A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE FROM A COMPETITIVE PARTY IN A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM. THE LEGITIMACY OF THE PARTY'S DOMINANT ROLE AND THE PARTY-STATE REGIME, THEREFORE, DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE PARTY CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE POLITICAL MOMENTUM TO LEAD THE PEOPLE AND REPRESENT THEM IN THE FUTURE.
520	THE INSERTION OF "RESILIENCY OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS" INTO THE FIVE KEY PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 CZECH PRESIDENCY INDICATES A POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO FOCUS ON THE RULE OF LAW AGENDA. THE FOLLOWING TEXT ASPIRES TO MAP THE PRACTICE OF THE CZECH PRESIDENCY IN THE DOMAIN OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND RULE OF LAW AND EXPLAIN THE REASONS BEHIND ITS (IN)ABILITY TO DELIVER THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES. FIRSTLY, THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE SPECIFICS OF THE EU REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE IMPACT OF THE CZECH INTERNAL POLITICAL SITUATION AFTER THE 2021 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS ON THE PRESIDENCY'S PERFORMANCE. SECONDLY, THE TEXT COVERS FOUR KEY POLICY ISSUES THAT REQUIRED THE PRESIDENCY'S ATTENTION IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2022: THE EVALUATION OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEMS OF MEMBER STATES, THE FORMATION OF NEW EU RULES FOR MEDIA FREEDOM AND THE FIGHT AGAINST DISINFORMATION, THE AMENDMENT OF THE EP ELECTION PROCESS, AND THE JUDICIAL RESPONSE TO THE CRIMES COMMITTED DURING THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE.
521	AS LEGAL FORMALIZATION OF THE POLITICAL PACT THE STATE, ARISES TO PROTECT THE HABITANTS OF THE VIOLENCE EXERTED BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS STRONGER. THE STRENGTHENING OF CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACIES IS INTIMATELY LINKED TO THE INCORPORATION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, WHOSE CONCEPT CORRESPONDS TO THE VISION OF WESTERN SOCIETY AND IS NOT ALWAYS COMPATIBLE WITH THE WORLDVIEW OF THE NATIVE PEOPLES, WHICH GENERATES MUCH OF THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE STATE THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM EXERCISING THEIR OWN LEGAL SYSTEMS, DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE MAIN POSTULATES OF HUMAN RIGHTS RESPECT FOR THEIR CULTURAL IDENTITY AND ABOVE ALL A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF A RULE OF LAW.
522	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES TO WHAT EXTENT BULGARIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN RECENT YEARS AND THE REASONS THIS AIM HAS REMAIN UNATTAINED. IT OUTLINES THE "PERIPHERAL STATUS" OF LAW IN BULGARIAN SOCIETY BECAUSE OF THE SOCIETY'S UNACCOMPLISHED MODERNIZATION. NEXT, THE MANIFESTATION OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS ANALYZED FOLLOWING MARTIN MENDELSKI'S CONCEPTUAL MODEL (DE JURE AND DE FACTO LEGALITY), IN PARTICULAR, IN RELATION TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. THE ANALYSIS IS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE FROM THE LEGAL BAROMETER PROJECT AND THE STUDY OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY OF THE 44TH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. THE EMPIRICAL FACTS PROVE THAT THE STATE MOSTLY PRODUCES LEGAL TEXTS AND CREATES ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES (IN ITS ANTI-CORRUPTION REFORMS AS WELL), BUT NOT ACTUAL RESULTS IN LEGAL DEFENCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND IN DEFENCE OF PUBLIC INTERESTS IN GENERAL.
523	WHAT MAKES PROPERTY RESTITUTION "SUCCESSFUL" IN POSTWAR KOSOVO? HOW ARE MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING, AND CONFLICTING PROPERTY REGIMES FOLDED INTO THE PROCESS OF POSTWAR TRANSITION? AND WHAT CAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RULE OF LAW ILLUMINATE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTIONISM? DAILY PRACTICES AT THE KOSOVO PROPERTY AGENCY (KPA, THE ADMINISTRATIVE, QUASI-JUDICIAL INSTITUTION THAT THE UNITED NATIONS TASKED WITH POSTWAR PROPERTY RESTITUTION) REVEAL THE RUNAWAY EFFECT OF THE GROWING BUREAUCRATIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS: INSTITUTIONAL SUCCESS IS MEASURED THROUGH NEOLIBERAL "TECHNOLOGIES OF ACCOUNTABILITY," AND THE PROJECT ITSELF BECOMES THE KEY OUTCOME. THIS IS THE RESULT OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT THAT SAW THE LEGALIZATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AS A CORNERSTONE OF POST-CONFLICT STATE-BUILDING. A PARALLEL SHIFT TOWARDS MANAGERIALISM AND AUDITABILITY IN PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT HAS GIVEN RISE TO DEMANDS FOR EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. TOGETHER, THESE MOVES, WHICH FOUND FERTILE GROUND IN KOSOVO'S RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS AND DETERMINED THE MANDATE AND INSTITUTIONAL SETUP OF PROPERTY RESTITUTION, TRANSFORM RULE OF LAW FROM AN IDEALIZED PUBLIC GOOD TO A SHORTSIGHTED, BOX-TICKING EXERCISE CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF MEASURABLE RETURNS. THESE BENCHMARKS SIDESTEP THE COMPLICATED HISTORICAL LEGACIES OF PROPERTY RELATIONS AND ENTITLEMENTS AND GENERATE NEW FORMS OF RIGHTS INEQUALITY.
524	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE RECENT SHIFT IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S APPROACH TOWARDS CANDIDATE STATES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS.(1) IT ARGUES THAT THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS STARTED TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO PARLIAMENTS IN CANDIDATE STATES IN ORDER TO PROMOTE AND SECURE ACCESSION-RELATED REFORMS. AS A RESULT, NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN CANDIDATE STATES HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO SHAPE THE CONTENT OF THESE REFORMS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE RULE OF LAW SECTOR. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ARTICLE ELABORATES ON THE FACTORS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT BALKAN PARLIAMENTS' INVOLVEMENT IN THE ACCESSION PROCESS.
525	THE ARTICLE CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE EU'S CONCEPTUALISATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ITS ENLARGEMENT PRACTICE. TWO MAIN ARGUMENTS WILL BE ADVANCED. FIRST, IT WILL BE ARGUED THAT LEGALITY IS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND ADHERENCE TO IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY INSTITUTIONAL ORDER GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, AS EVIDENCED IN THE TREATY (ARTICLE 2 TEU) AND AS ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE. SECONDLY, IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT THE EU'S PRE-ACCESSION PROCESS DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THIS RULE OF LAW ELEMENT, TO THE EXTENT THAT A) ITS MAIN FOCUS IS ALIGNMENT WITH THE ACQUIS, AND B) CHANGES MADE TO DOMESTIC LEGISLATION ARE MEASURED IN TERMS OF QUANTITY AND NOT QUALITY. IT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS GENERATES PROBLEMS OF LEGALITY IN THE CANDIDATE STATES, INCLUDING LEGAL INFLATION, INSTABILITY, LACK OF GENERALITY OF LAW AND COHERENCE, AS WELL AS PROBLEMS OF ENFORCEMENT. IT WILL BE ASSERTED THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS RECOGNISED BY THE COMMISSION, OVER THE YEARS THE EU HAS NOT AMENDED ITS METHODOLOGY, THEREBY FAILING TO RECOGNISE THAT ENSURING RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT MERELY A PROCESS OF ADOPTION OF A CORPUS OF RULES, BUT RATHER A COMPLEX PROCESS OF ADAPTATION TO A PARTICULAR VALUE SYSTEM. THE ARTICLE CONTINUES BY ARGUING THAT THE QUALITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE ACQUIS LEAVE CONSIDERABLE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RAISING QUESTIONS AS TO ITS SUITABILITY AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE (POTENTIAL) CANDIDATE COUNTRIES. AS A CONCLUSION, SOME POLICY REFLECTIONS WILL BE OFFERED ON HOW THESE ISSUES COULD BE BETTER ADDRESSED.
526	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF MULTI-LEVEL APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT (UCGS) ON THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL. BASED ON A SINGLE-CASE STUDY OF THE 2016 GAMBIAN UCG, THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE TENDS TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT ONLY IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THESE INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE RULES OF THE ROAD REGULATING HOW THE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GOVERNANCE INTERACT - SUBSIDIARITY V. PRECEDENCE FOR ORGANIZATIONS FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE - AND THE DEFINITION OF A COMMON PURPOSE. SUCH UNITY OF PURPOSE IS EASIER TO ATTAIN IF THE (GEO)POLITICAL STAKES OF A CRISIS ARE RELATIVELY LOW, THE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS OF A MILITARY INTERVENTION HIGH, AND IF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE UCG HAVE FORFEITED THEIR LEGITIMACY BOTH LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY. THIS PREVENTS THEM FROM EXPLOITING INSTITUTIONAL RIVALRIES AND SHRINKS THEIR SPACE FOR DIPLOMATIC MANOEUVRE AND THUS THEIR ABILITY TO USE FORUM SHOPPING FOR THEIR BENEFIT. IF THESE CONDITIONS ARE MET, THEN MULTI-LEVEL RESPONSES TO UCG WILL STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL.
527	RULE-OF-LAW DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE WEST AND RUSSIA HAS EFFECTIVELY RUN INTO A DEAD END. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO OPEN UP A NEW PERSPECTIVE BY ADDRESSING THE CORPORATION AS A SUB-UNIT OF SOCIETY. OBSERVING THAT RUSSIA, BEFORE ADOPTING A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR RISK MANAGEMENT IN SUMMER 2018, HAS HAD ALMOST 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS APPROACHES TO RISK MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE COMPLIANCE, THE QUESTION IS WHETHER CORPORATE LAW HAS FINALLY REACHED THE POINT OF SHEDDING SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF RUSSIAN LAW IN GENERAL TO TURN THE CORPORATE SPHERE INTO A SPACE IN WHICH CITIZENS ARE ABLE TO PURSUE THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS IN A SAFE AND LEGALLY PROTECTED MANNER. THUS, WE MAY BE ON THE EVE OF WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF A RULEOF-LAW CULTURE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL DOMAIN OF CITIZEN-STATE RELATIONS. THIS WOULD OPEN UP AVENUES FOR A RENEWED DIALOGUE ON RULE OF LAW BETWEEN THE WEST AND RUSSIA.
528	PRIOR TO THE 1994 GENOCIDE, RWANDAN LAW PROVIDED AMNESTY FOR PERSONS WHO COMMITTED SERIOUS CRIMES IN THE SERVICE OF THE HUTU "SOCIAL REVOLUTION" AGAINST THE TUTSI ELITES. MURDER AND OTHER CRIMINAL ACTS UNDERTAKEN BY HUTUS WHO CHALLENGED TUTSI POLITICAL DOMINATION WERE EFFECTIVELY FORGIVEN BY AMNESTY. THE LAW WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPEALED DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF RWANDA WHEN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WAS RESTRUCTURED. THIS ENTAILED THE REVITALIZATION OF THE TRADITIONAL GACACA COURTS DUE TO THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CASES ARISING FROM THE 1994 MASSACRES. SIMULTANEOUSLY, IT SPURRED CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES TO ENSURE THE MODERNIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE AMNESTY LAW AND ITS ROLE IN CREATING A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY THAT LED TO GENOCIDE. IT EXPLAINS HOW THE GACACA COURTS AROSE IN THE FACE OF MASSIVE CRIMINAL CASELOADS AND IT DESCRIBES THE LEGAL CHANGES THAT REFORMED THE JUDICIARY AND PAVED THE WAY FOR CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF LEGAL RIGHTS.
529	HOW HAVE GOVERNMENTS IN RICH COUNTRIES DEVELOPED THE ABILITY TO LEVY TAXES ON THEIR CITIZENS AND ACHIEVE HIGH COMPLIANCE? WHILE IT MAY SEEM SIMPLE, THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING FISCAL CAPACITY IS OFTEN LONG AND TORTUROUS. WE EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT GOVERNMENTS BUILD THIS CAPACITY IN PART BY MAKING A CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. WE IDENTIFY LARGE, SUSTAINED JUMPS IN HOW COUNTRIES SCORE ON BOTH BROAD AND NARROW MEASURES OF LEGAL SYSTEM AND PROPERTY RIGHTS QUALITY AND INVESTIGATE IF THESE JUMPS PRODUCE INCREASES IN SEVERAL MEASURES OF FISCAL CAPACITY. IN A SAMPLE OF 119 COUNTRIES FROM 1970 TO 2015, WE FIND SUSTAINED IMPROVE-MENTS IN PROPERTY RIGHTS DO NOT CAUSE INCREASES IN ANY OF OUR FISCAL CAPACITY MEASURES. IF THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG PROPERTY RIGHTS IS INDEED NECESSARY FOR DEVELOPING FISCAL CAPACITY, IT IS EVIDENTLY NOT SUFFICIENT.
530	THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES THE PLANNING PROCESS AND INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW MISSION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN KOSOVO (EULEX). IT SHOWS THAT THE ORIGINAL INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A SMALLER PRESENCE THAN THE PREDECESSOR UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN KOSOVO (UNMIK). YET AS A RESULT OF A LACK OF SETTLEMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL STATUS OF KOSOVO, THE EUROPEAN UNION ENDED UP WITH A ROBUST MANDATE AND IT WAS UNABLE TO MAKE A FRESH START IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH ITSELF FROM THE UNITED NATIONS. EULEX HAS, NONETHELESS, SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF, BUT IT REMAINS TOO EARLY FOR A FINAL JUDGMENT.
531	UK PUBLIC LAW IS OFTEN VIEWED AS A SOPHISTICATED POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIVAL INSTITUTIONS, AN APPROACH ENCOURAGED BY THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE LAW IS ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON SUCH CONTINGENCIES AS THE EXISTENCE OF AN OFFICIAL CONSENSUS ABOUT ITS SOURCES. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, LEGAL JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE READ AS STRATEGIC MOVES WITHIN THE POLITICAL POWER-GAME. WE CAN MAKE BETTER SENSE OF PUBLIC LAW IF, INSTEAD, WE INTERPRET IT AS THE ARTICULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF STANDARDS OF LEGITIMATE GOVERNANCE, INSPIRED BY UNIVERSAL IDEALS OF INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND HUMAN DIGNITY. THE RULE OF LAW DENIES THE LEGAL VALIDITY OF ARBITRARY, UNJUSTIFIED ASSERTIONS OF POWER INIMICAL TO THOSE IDEALS. POSITIVE LAW IS, AT ROOT, AN INSTANTIATION OF NATURAL LAW, AS THE INTERPLAY OF LEGAL RULE AND UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE, CHARACTERISTIC OF COMMON LAW REASONING, CONFIRMS. THERE ARE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATIONS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, THE LIMITS OF PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY, THE NATURE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY, AND THE SCOPE AND CONTENT OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.
532	THE UN CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WAS RATIFIED IN NORWAY, JUNE 2013. NORDIC COUNTRIES ARE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROMOTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL AS DISABILITY RIGHTS. THE RULE OF LAW INDEX FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT RANKS THE NORDIC COUNTRIES AMONG THE TOP NATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH STANDARDS OF JUSTICE (BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE) AND RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO WELL-KNOWN EXAMPLES OF GRAVE MISCARRIAGES OF JUSTICE IN CASES WHERE DISABLED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. THESE CASES ADDRESS ISSUES OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND QUESTIONS BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. TAKING THE SITUATION OF DEAF PEOPLE IN NORWAY AS A CASE, THIS STUDY ASKS WHAT BARRIERS DEAF PEOPLE FACE WHEN REPORTING A CRIME, BEING ACCUSED OF A CRIME OR BEING A WITNESS IN COURT. THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH IS SEMI-STRUCTURED, OPEN-ENDED INTERVIEWS WITH DEAF PERSONS, PROFESSIONAL SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS, JUDGES, PROSECUTORS, POLICE OFFICERS AND LAWYERS. ALL THE INFORMANTS HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES FROM ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN DEAF PEOPLE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THIS SITUATION IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS, ACCESS TO JUSTICE, NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUAL RECOGNITION BEFORE THE LAW.
533	PLATFORMS GOVERN USERS, AND THE WAY THAT PLATFORMS GOVERN MATTERS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I PROPOSE THAT THE LEGITIMACY OF GOVERNANCE OF USERS BY PLATFORMS SHOULD BE EVALUATED AGAINST THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN PARTICULAR, I SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRIVATE GOVERNANCE IS CONSENSUAL, TRANSPARENT, EQUALLY APPLIED AND RELATIVELY STABLE, AND FAIRLY ENFORCED. THESE ARE THE CORE VALUES OF GOOD GOVERNANCE, BUT ARE ALIEN TO THE SYSTEMS OF CONTRACT LAW THAT CURRENTLY UNDERPIN RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLATFORMS AND THEIR USERS. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF SERVICE OF 14 MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, I SHOW HOW THESE VALUES CAN BE APPLIED TO EVALUATE GOVERNANCE, AND HOW POORLY PLATFORMS PERFORM ON THESE CRITERIA. I ARGUE THAT THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDE A LANGUAGE TO NAME AND WORK THROUGH CONTESTED CONCERNS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLATFORMS AND THEIR USERS. THIS IS AN INCREASINGLY URGENT TASK. FINDING A WAY TO APPLY THESE VALUES TO ARTICULATE A SET OF DESIRABLE RESTRAINTS ON THE EXERCISE OF POWER IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS THE KEY CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE PROJECT OF DIGITAL CONSTITUTIONALISM.
534	THE DEFENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE EU IN RECENT YEARS. THIS FUNDAMENTAL VALUE OF THE EU HAS BEEN THREATENED BY CERTAIN MEASURES TAKEN IN SEVERAL STATES, AMONG WHICH IS THE POLISH STATE, THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MOST PRECIOUS ELEMENTS OF ANY DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM: THE ROLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AS GUARANTOR OF LEGALITY, THE OBJECTIVITY OF THE PUBLIC MEDIA, THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OR, MORE RECENTLY, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. FACED WITH THESE ATTACKS ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS BEEN THE FIRST INSTITUTION TO REACT, ALTHOUGH IN A FIRST STAGE, IT HAS DONE SO WITH SOME PARSIMONY, USING THE MEANS OFFERED BY ARTICLE 7 OF THE TEU AND THE RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK. THE LIMITED SUCCESS OF THESE MECHANISMS, TOGETHER WITH THE PERSISTENT ATTITUDE THAT VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW ON THE PART OF THE POLISH STATE, HAS PRODUCED A CHANGE OF ATTITUDE IN THE COMMISSION THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY A FIRM ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE. TOGETHER THEY HAVE UNDERTAKEN A CRUSADE IN DEFENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH FOR THE MOMENT HAS REACHED ITS CLIMAX IN THE ORDER OF INTERIM MEASURES OF DECEMBER 2018, WHICH IS ANALISED IN THIS PAPER.
535	WE EXPLORE THE LEVEL OF INTERMEDIATION IN THE 17 (OUT OF 29) TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE FOR WHICH DATA ARE AVAILABLE. WE FIND THAT, CETERIS PARIBUS, THE LEVELS OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION RELATIVE TO GDP ARE BETWEEN 21 AND 28 PERCENTAGE POINTS BELOW OUR SAMPLE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT THE FORMER SOVIET COUNTRIES HAVE LOWER LEVELS OF INTERMEDIATION THAN THE NON-SOVIET EASTERN EUROPEAN TRANSITIONAL ECONOMIES. WE DOCUMENT THAT RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL ENFORCEMENT INCREASE INTERMEDIATION AND CONCLUDE THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THESE COUNTRIES WILL BE MORE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE SUCH GROWTH IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE WITHOUT A DEVELOPED BANKING SYSTEM.

536	CAN CITIZENS' INTEREST IN NON-DOMINATION BE SATISFIED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND THE GUARANTEE OF NON-ARBITRARINESS? THIS COMMENT ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES AN INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF LAW THAT ENTAILS AN ADDITIONAL POSITIVE LAW, THROUGH CONVENTIONS, COMMON LAW, JUDICIAL PRECEDENTS OR CONSTITUTIONS, WHICH THE SOVEREIGN CANNOT LEGALLY OVERRIDE. IN THE SUPRANATIONAL CONTEXT, THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES AN EQUILIBRIUM OF CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT BETWEEN DIFFERENT LEGALITIES BY AVOIDING A LEGAL MONOPOLY OF A SUPREME AUTHORITY AND FOSTERING THE INTERACTION AMONG ORDERS BASED ON CONTENT-DEPENDENT REASONS. THE SAME APPLIES TO THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ECTHR AND MEMBER STATES. THE MARGIN OF APPRECIATION, TAKEN AS A REMINDER OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, EMBODIES A NON-DOMINATION CAVEAT TO CONSIDER (THE REASONS FROM) THE 'NORMATIVITIES' OF DIFFERENT ORDERS. NONETHELESS, AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE TOOL OF THE COURT, IT ALLOWS FOR AN OFTEN-DISPUTED DISCRETION. ACCORDINGLY, BETTER REFINED GUIDELINES AND JUSTIFICATIONS ARE REQUIRED.
537	THE RULE OF LAW IS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY SUPPORTED AT THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THE EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THEORY, HOWEVER, IS POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE OF WIDELY DIVERGENT VIEWS OF WHAT IT MEANS IN PRACTICE. DISPARATE NATIONAL TRADITIONS POSED FEW PROBLEMS WHILE OPERATING IN PARALLEL, BUT EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE NECESSITATED A REASSESSMENT OF THIS PLURALISM. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A CORE DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A POLITICAL IDEAL AND ARGUES THAT ITS APPLICABILITY TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WILL DEPEND ON THAT IDEAL BEING SEEN AS A MEANS RATHER THAN AN END, AS SERVING A FUNCTION RATHER THAN DEFINING A STATUS. SUCH A VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AND APPROPRIATELY HIGHLIGHTS THE POLITICAL WORK THAT MUST BE DONE IF POWER IS TO BE CHANNELED THROUGH LAW.
538	THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE RULE OF LAW AFFECTS SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE AND ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, LEGAL ORIGINS AFFECT THE STRENGTH OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE USE DATA FROM 36 MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT. THE LEGAL ORIGINS AFFECT THE RULE OF LAW AND HAVE DIFFERENT MARGINAL EFFECTS ON PUBLIC FINANCIAL RESOURCES. FURTHER, SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURES HAVE A CORRECTION EFFECT ON ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. HOWEVER, THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE ON ECONOMIC INEQUALITY DIFFERS BASED ON ITS LEGAL ORIGINS. INCREASING SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE AFFECTS CORRECTING ECONOMIC INEQUALITY TO ELABORATE CONCERNING ALL LEGAL ORIGINS. PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES THAT ADOPTED FRENCH LEGAL ORIGINS, HIGH SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURE FURTHER IMPROVES ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. IN CONTRAST, INCREASES IN SOCIAL SECURITY EXPENDITURES OF COUNTRIES WITH ENGLISH LEGAL ORIGINS DO NOT IMPROVE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY TO A LARGE EXTENT. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES IN LEGAL ORIGINS RESULT IN VARIOUS TYPES OF CAPITALISM.
539	THIS WORK PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURES ADOPTED BY LEADING DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 EMERGENCY, AND THE COMPATIBILITY ISSUES THAT AROSE BETWEEN THESE MEASURES AND THE GUARANTEES OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE GLOBAL AND SIMULTANEOUS SCOPE OF THIS SERIOUS EMERGENCY FACILITATES COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND REVEALS THEIR ADVANTAGES AND THEIR SHORTCOMINGS. THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE VARIOUS EXTRA-CONSTITUTIONAL METHODS EMPLOYED IN RESPONSE TO THE EXCEPTION AS WELL AS THE STATE OF EXCEPTION MODEL, BASED ON THE REGULATION OF EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS AND THE MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED. LASTLY, THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE CONTRADICTIONS THAT HAVE ARISEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE USE AND NON-USE OF THE STATE OF EXCEPTION MODEL IN THE RESPONSE TO COVID-19 IN EUROPE.
540	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE 2015 LAW ON ASSOCIATIONS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS IN CAMBODIA ("NGO LAW") FROM 2011-17 AND EXPLORES ITS CONNECTION TO THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER OUTLINING THE CONTENT, DEFINITIONS AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RELATED TO THE NGO LAW, IT PROVIDES A COMMENTARY ON ITS INITIAL APPLICATION, AND EXAMINES ITS POTENTIAL ARTICULATION WITH OTHER LEGISLATION (SUCH AS DEFAMATION AND LIBEL, TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAW AND LAND LAW). I ARGUE THAT THE NGO LAW SHOULD BE CHARACTERISED AS A CAREFULLY CRAFTED PIECE OF LEGISLATION, DEVELOPED AND DEFENDED OVER TIME BY THE RULING POLITICAL PARTY TO INCREASE CONTROL AND INTIMIDATION BY INVOKING ADHERENCE TO THE "RULE OF LAW". NARRATIVES OF NATIONAL SECURITY, TERRORISM, NEUTRALITY AND CULTURAL COHESION HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN WITH NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO OBFUSCATE OVERT POLITICAL INTERFERENCE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE NGO LAW INTERSECTS WITH, AND CONSOLIDATES, THE RECENT TREND OF THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF LEGISLATION AS A POLITICAL TOOL TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATE POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND GOVERNMENT CRITICS. THIS IS NOT TO DENY THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF CIVIL SOCIETY ACTION AND SERVICE PROVISION THAT REQUIRE GREATER GOVERNMENT CONTROL VIA REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. NEVERTHELESS, THE STATE'S ATTEMPTS TO TIGHTEN CIVIL SPACE ARE BEING MET WITH RESISTANCE AND "WORK AROUND" STRATEGIES FROM THE PLETHORA OF DIVERSE ORGANISATIONS FUNCTIONING IN CAMBODIA.
541	THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE CRISIS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE HISTORY OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. SINCE THE MID-1990S, THE UNION HAS BEEN GRADUALLY EQUIPPING ITSELF WITH SPECIFIC PROCEDURES SO THAT ITS INSTITUTIONS CAN RESPOND TO A POSSIBLE VIOLATION OF ITS VALUES BY A MEMBER STATE. THIS PROCESS RESPONDED PARTICULARLY TO THE IMMINENCE OF A FIFTH ENLARGEMENT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED DIMENSION, WHICH WOULD INCORPORATE STATES WITH A SHORT DEMOCRATIC BACKGROUND. YEARS LATER, IN A CONTEXT MARKED BY THE RISE OF POPULISM, THE ILLIBERAL DRIFT OF THE HUNGARIAN AND POLISH GOVERNMENTS HAS CAUSED THE FIRST USE OF THE NEW PROCEDURES, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR INSUFFICIENCY IN THE FACE OF A CRISIS OF THIS NATURE AND SHOWING THE LIMITS OF THE UNION'S ABILITY TO EXERT ITS INFLUENCE AFTER ACCESSION.
542	THE JUDICIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE DYNAMIC PROCESS OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT, AS THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU, THROUGH ITS CREATIVE AND EXTENSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE TREATIES, BECAME AN IMPORTANT CATALYST FOR THE INTEGRATION PROCESS. THE NEXT PHASE OF THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION SEEMS TO BE THE 'INTEGRATION THROUGH THE RULE OF LAW', AS THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROCESS MUST BE BASED ON A SECURE AND SOLID GROUND, REAFFIRMING THE UNION AS A COMMUNITY OF VALUES. GIVEN ITS IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONFIDENCE OF CITIZENS IN THE UNION AND THE EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF POLICIES, THE RULE OF LAW IS OF CENTRAL RELEVANCE TO THE FUTURE OF EUROPE. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE PROGRESSIVE AND INFLUENTIAL ROLE OF THE CJEU REGARDING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AS A STARTING PREMISE FOR DETERMINING ITS POTENTIAL AS AN ACTOR IN THE PROCESS OF OVERCOMING THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES.
543	THIS DOSSIER TAKES A SYSTEMATIC LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT WORKS AND MOST RELEVANT RESOURCES REGARDING TWO ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT STATE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. TWO QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ON THE GROUNDS OF THEIR CURRENT RELEVANCE AND SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS. FIRSTLY, THE SO-CALLED BREXIT PROCESS AND THE IMPLICATIONS ON ACTIVATING ARTICLE 50 OF THE TEU FOR THE FIRST TIME, WITH THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS AND PROBLEMS THAT THIS BRINGS ABOUT, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THAT IT HAS BEEN TRIGGERED BY THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND, GIVEN THE SITUATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND. AND SECONDLY, THE POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY HUNGARY AND POLAND, WHICH HAVE LED, ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME, TO ACTIVATION OF THE EU RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK AND TRIGGERING OF THE PREVENTIVE MECHANISM OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE TEU, TOGETHER WITH ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF OBLIGATIONS. IN THIS DOSSIER, THESE TWO CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED SEPARATELY, ALSO DEALING WITH THE TWO COUNTRIES SEPARATELY IN THE SECTION ON THE RULE OF LAW.
544	BACKGROUND: THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE AND COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION PLAY ONE OF THE MAIN ROLES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE STUDY OF THE CONSTITUTIONALISATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS ITS CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS, IN PARTICULAR, THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, PROPORTIONALITY, AND DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION OF UKRAINE. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE ON THE CONTENT OF THE ABOVE ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS EMPHASISED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO DEFINING THE LIMITS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE CONTENT OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IS MANIFESTED IN THE PROPORTIONALLY REASONABLE RELATION BETWEEN THE PURPOSE OF RESTRICTING A CERTAIN HUMAN RIGHT AND THE MEANS USED BY THE STATE TO LIMIT IT. IN ADDITION, IT IS NOTED THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF DIRECT ACTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AS AN ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS LIMITED EFFECT AND RELATES MAINLY TO PROVISIONS ON HUMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, AS WELL AS THE PROVISIONS OF NEW PROCEDURAL CODES INTRODUCING A NOVELTY, WHICH ARE GENERALLY PERCEIVED POSITIVELY. METHODS: THE PAPER USED THE FOLLOWING METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS TO EXAMINE THE MAIN APPROACHES TO THE DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS: THE SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL METHOD, WHICH ALLOWED US TO GIVE A STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS TO ANALYSE THE CONTENT OF ITS ELEMENTS, AND THE LOGICAL-LEGAL METHOD, WHICH PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THE CONTENT OF THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO SUBSTANTIATING THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONTENT OF ITS STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS IN THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF UKRAINE WERE DEVELOPED AND ANALYSED.
545	THE POLITICAL ASPECTS OF THE FORMATION OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE RULE OF LAW IN MODEM AZERBAIJAN COINCIDE WITH THE GENERAL TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBALIZATION AND POLITICAL PROCESSES IN THE MODEM WORLD. THE NATURE OF THE CIVIL SOCIETY FORMATION IN AZERBAIJAN IS INSEPARABLY LINKED WITH THE REGIONAL POLITICAL PROCESSES. IN PARTICULAR, THE ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL POLITICAL AND REGIONAL PROCESSES, CONDUCTED ON THE BASIS OF CONSIDERATION OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES OF THE COUNTRY, THE MAIN STAGES OF POST-SOVIET DEVELOPMENT, AND TENDENCIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIL SOCIETY, WHICH ARC MAINLY MANIFESTED THROUGH SUCH FORMS OF SOCIAL LIFE AS THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, CORRUPTION AND BUREAUCRACY, AUTHORITARIANISM IN VARIOUS ECHELONS OF POWER, SHOWED THAT THE CIVIL SOCIETY IN AZERBAIJAN HAD NOT YET MET THE ADVANCED STANDARDS OF OPEN SOCIETY AND DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. THE FORMATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS HAMPERED BY THE REGIONAL CONTRADICTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, THE NAGORNO-KARABAKH CONFLICT, AS WELL AS HIGH LEGAL ILLITERACY OF THE POPULATION, THE TRADITIONS-BOUND NATURE OF THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE, ELEMENTS OF CORRUPTION AND AUTHORITARIANISM IN MANAGEMENT AT CERTAIN LEVELS.
546	IN LINE WITH THE LISBON TREATY, THE SAFEGUARDING AND PROMOTION OF EU FUNDAMENTAL VALUES HAS ACQUIRED THE LEGAL STATUS OF A GUIDING PRINCIPLE AND A GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF ITS EXTERNAL POLICIES, INCLUDING EU TRADE POLICY. IN THIS VEIN, AND WITH A VIEW TO STRENGTHENING THE LINKAGES BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, TRADE, AND PEACE, JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW (ROL) IN THE AGENDA 2030, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROL AS A NON-TRADE POLICY OBJECTIVE (NTPO) THAT HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE VAST MAJORITY OF EU PREFERENTIAL TRADE AGREEMENTS (PTAS) WITH THIRD COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, IT FOCUSES ON THE EU'S FIVE "NEW GENERATION" PTAS WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, LOCATED ON DIFFERENT CONTINENTS, EMPHASIZING THE PTAS'ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS. WE FIND THAT, ALTHOUGH THE PTAS CONTAIN FAR-REACHING ROL CLAUSES, THE EU LACKS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY OF PROMOTING THE ROL UNDER ITS TRADE POLICY.
547	IN THIS PAPER I ARGUE, AFTER EXAMINING THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTRAST TO THE RULE OF VIRTUE IN THE HISTORY OF BOTH WESTERN AND EAST ASIAN POLITICAL THOUGHT, THAT THE RULE OF VIRTUE IS NECESSARY TO COMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW IN CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACIES. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, IN SECTION TWO I SUMMARIZE THE VIEWS OF MODERN WESTERN THINKERS WHO ASSERTED THAT THE RULE OF LAW WAS ABSENT IN THE NON-WESTERN WORLD AND BRIEFLY DEFINE THE KEY CONCEPTS USED INT HE PAPER. IN SECTIONS THREE AND FOUR, I EXAMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW, FOCUSING ON MAJOR ANCIENT POLITICAL THEORISTS OF THE WEST AND EAST ASIA, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING THAT ALL CIVILIZED SOCIETIES HAVE ACTUALLY PURSUED THE INTEGRATION OF THE TWO SYSTEMS. INT HE CONCLUDING SECTION, I ARGUE THAT RESPECT FOR THE LAW IS ACTUALLY THE OUTCOME OF THE RULE OF VIRTUE RATHER THAN OF THE RULE OF LAW, THEREBY STRESSING THAT THE MODERN RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE COMPLEMENTED BY THE RULE OF VIRTUE.
548	DURING THE SAME PERIOD THAT MARTIN KRYGIER PUBLISHED SEVERAL OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLES ON THE RULE OF LAW, HE WAS ALSO AT WORK ON AN AMBITIOUS INTERPRETATION OF THE SOCIAL THEORY OF THE U.S. SOCIOLOGIST, PHILIP SELZNICK (1919-2010). IN THE RESULTING VOLUME, PHILIP SELZNICK: IDEALS IN THE WORLD (2012), KRYGIER GENEROUSLY ACKNOWLEDGED SELZNICK'S INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF SELZNICK'S TREATMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. MY ESSAY CONSIDERS KRYGIER AND SELZNICK'S DISTINCTIVE COMMITMENTS TO STUDYING THE RULE OF LAW AS BOTH MORAL IDEAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTION SHAPED BY EXTRALEGAL FORCES. FOLLOWING A BRIEF SURVEY OF SELZNICK'S CONTRIBUTIONS, I CONSIDER ELEMENTS OF COMMONALITY AND CONTRAST IN THEIR COMMON CONCERN TO RECOGNIZE THE LIMITS AND VINDICATE THE PROMISE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
549	THE JUSTIFCATION FOR THE SOCIAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW IS FOUND IN THE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT OR CONTRACT IN WHICH THE WARRANTIES OF THE CITIZENS IS EXPRESSED BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE CONTRACT. THAT IS WHY CONTRACTUALISM HAS BEEN PRESENTED AS THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LEGITIMATION OF A STATE. BASED ON THE SOCIAL REALITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL, WHICH IS WHY MATERIAL JUSTICE EXISTS, THE SOCIAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AIMS TO PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE PARTICIPANTS. THOSE ELEMENTS ARE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COLOMBIAN SOCIAL STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH STANDS AS A WELFARE STATE AND A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC STATE. ITS FINAL PURPOSE IS TO LIMIT ARBITRARY ACTIONS IN ORDER TO BECOME A COUNTRY THAT GUARANTEES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL.
550	THE FOLLOWING LINES WERE MOTIVATED BY THE WILL OF ANSWERING THE CRITIC NOTE OF CHRISTIAN DELACAMPAGNE, INCLUDED IN HIS CHAPTER ABOUT LIBERTY AND THE OPPONENTS OF DEMOCRACY - PART OF LA PHILOSOPHIE POLITIQUE AUJOURD'HUI: IDEES, DEBATS, ENJEUX, PUBLISHED IN 2000 - WHICH AIMED GIORGIO AGAMBEN'S TENTATIVE OF APPROACHING DEMOCRACY AND TOTALITARIANISM, ESPECIALLY IN HOMO SACER: IL POTERE SOVRANO E LA NUDA VITA, PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1995. BEFORE COURSING THE BASIC POINTS OF DELACAMPAGNE'S INTERPRETATION AND THE DIALECTIC CONFRONTATION WITH ANOTHER POSSIBLE READING OF AGAMBEN'S TEXTS, WE SHALL RETRIEVE WHAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WITH THE EXPRESSION RULE OF LAW, NOT ONLY TO CONTEXTUALIZE THE DISCUSSION IN THE SCOPE OF A CONCEPTUAL REVALUATION, BUT TO LISTEN DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND AVOID EARLY MISTAKES. THE PRESENT ARTICLE INTENDS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPREHENSION OF GIORGIO AGAMBEN'S THESIS, OFFERING ELEMENTS TO THINK ONCE MORE SOME LIMITS AND PARADOXES OF DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW, GATHERED UNDER HIS OPTICS. ALSO, PERHAPS, TO ENABLE THE DESTINY OF ANOTHER EYE UPON DEMOCRACY; CERTAINLY CONTENTIOUS, HOWEVER INFALLIBLY CREATIVE.
551	MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE GENERAL ABILITY (OR LACK THEREOF) OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS TO EFFECTIVELY MONITOR AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THEIR RULE OF LAW PROJECTS ON THE GROUND. HOWEVER, LESS RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS' METHODS OF PROJECT EVALUATION, THE POLITICS BEHIND THEM AND THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. THIS PAPER OFFERS SUCH AN ANALYSIS OF THE EVALUATION METHODS OF GTZ LEGAL ADVISORY IN BEIJING. AFTER DESCRIBING THE WORK OF GTZ IN GENERAL AND ITS LEGAL ADVISORY IN PARTICULAR, THE PAPER OFFERS A DETAILED EVALUATION OF THE TOOLS THAT IT USES TO GAUGE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROJECTS ON THE GROUND. WHAT IS GAINED FROM SUCH A PARTICULARIZED ANALYSIS IS A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH THE DONOR POLITICS AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRADEOFFS INHERENT IN MONITORING AND EVALUATION DECISIONS, TWO FACTORS OFTEN GIVEN INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION IN MORE THEORETICAL DISCUSSIONS.
552	THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME THE COMMON SENSE OF CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL POLITICS. IN THIS ARTICLE I EXPLORE WHETHER THE EARLIEST RECORDED DELIBERATIONS ON THE RULE OF LAW, THOSE FOUND IN POLITICAL DEBATES IN ANCIENT GREECE, HAVE ANY SALIENCE FOR CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSIONS OF THE NORM. THE ARTICLE BRIEFLY MAPS HISTORICAL JURISPRUDENTIAL DEBATES ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IN GREECE (AND ATHENS ESPECIALLY) TO SUGGEST THAT NO SOONER WERE LAWS DEVELOPED TO SHAPE SOCIETY SO CONSIDERATION ALSO TURNED TO HOW THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT BE UNDERSTOOD AND DEFINED. MOREOVER, THE DEBATES IN ATHENS RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES, LINKED MOST CLEARLY TO A PROCEDURAL PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW'S CONTOURS THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED (EQUALLY) IN DEBATES ABOUT THE NORM IN THE NEW MILLENNIUM. THE LESSON THAT THESE DEBATES PROMPT IS THAT WHILE THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY MAY BE LINKED, IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR EITHER TO BE WELL DEVELOPED (APPROACHING CURRENT LIBERAL STANDARDS) FOR PROGRESSIVE DEBATES TO BE ENGENDERED ABOUT THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A JUST RULE OF LAW.
553	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF THE STRATEGIES AND THEORIES OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION IN NIGERIA THAT BREED INSTITUTIONAL MARGINALITY AND BAD GOVERNANCE DUE TO SHORTFALLS IN PURSUING THE VALUES OF JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT AS CORE DEMOCRATIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE SAME DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES SUCH AS VOTING, PARLIAMENT, CONSTITUTION, JUDICIARY, THAT ARE SUGGESTIVE OF GAINS SUCH AS RESPONSIBLE USE, AND PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER MAY NOT HAVE TRANSLATED FULLY INTO SOCIOPOLITICAL EMPOWERMENT FOR RESPONSIBILITY AND REPRESENTATION IN EVOLVING DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE IN NIGERIA DUE TO PROBLEMS OF AGENCY AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. DEMOCRATIC THEORIZING AND PARTICIPATION IN NIGERIA HAS DEFIED ORTHODOX PRESUPPOSITIONS SEEN IN THE DISRESPECT FOR BASIC RIGHTS AND THE DISREGARD FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN DEMOCRACY THAT ALLOW FOR FAIR PLAY WITHIN AND AMONG THE ELITES AND POLITICAL GRASSROOTS. THUS THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE NIGERIAN PREDICAMENT AS A MODEL OR CASE STUDY, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REASONS FOR THE SYSTEMATIC DISEMPOWERMENT OF GROUPS.
554	ONE CANNOT SEEM TO GET THROUGH A FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE THESE DAYS WITHOUT SOMEONE PROPOSING THE RULE OF LAW AS A SOLUTION TO ONE PROBLEM OR ANOTHER. THE RULE OF LAW IS UNDENIABLY IMPORTANT TO PEACEFUL, FREE, AND PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES, BUT IT IS NO QUICK FIX. IMPARTING THE RULE OF LAW TO A SOCIETY WITH NO HISTORY OF IT INVOLVES CHANGING THE ATTITUDES OF MASSES AND ELITES AND CREATING A POLITICAL CULTURE IN WHICH NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. UNFORTUNATELY, PROPONENTS OF RULE-OF-LAW REFORM TEND TO HAVE SIMPLER, LESS LASTING THINGS IN MIND, LIKE WRITING LEGAL CODES AND SPRUCING UP COURTS.
555	IF THE CRIMINAL TRIAL IS AIMED SIMPLY AT ASCERTAINING THE TRUTH OF A CRIMINAL CHARGE, IT IS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC TO PREVENT THE PROSECUTION FROM ADDUCING RELEVANT EVIDENCE ON THE GROUND OF ITS UNLAWFUL PROVENANCE. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE STARTING PREMISE BY REPLACING THE EPISTEMIC FOCUS WITH A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. IT OFFERS A NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EXCLUSION OF UNLAWFULLY OBTAINED EVIDENCE THAT IS ROOTED IN A THEORY OF THE CRIMINAL TRIAL AS A PROCESS OF HOLDING THE EXECUTIVE TO THE RULE OF LAW. ON THIS THEORY, IT IS THE ADMISSION RATHER THAN EXCLUSION OF SUCH EVIDENCE THAT IS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS THEORY AND OTHERS THAT ARE IN CURRENCY WILL BE NOTED, AS WILL ITS IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS.
556	MARKET VALUE CREATION FOR THE LOCAL PARTNER IN AN INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCE (ISA) THAT TAKES PLACE IN A DEVELOPED MARKET ECONOMY IS WELL DOCUMENTED; HOWEVER, VALUE CREATION FOR THE LOCAL PARTNER OF AN ALLIANCE IN AN EMERGING MARKET (EM) HAS RECEIVED LESS ATTENTION. WE CONTEND THAT RULE OF LAW IS A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE CREATION FOR THE LOCAL PARTNER BECAUSE WEAK RULE OF LAW IN AN EM MAY SUPPRESS THE FOREIGN PARTNER'S WILLINGNESS TO SHARE ITS VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE ASSETS, WHICH ARE A CRITICAL SOURCE OF VALUE FOR THE EM PARTNER. WHILE RULE OF LAW DIRECTLY AFFECTS VALUE CREATION FROM THE ISA FOR THE EM PARTNER, WE ARGUE THAT ALLIANCE TYPE (R&D VS. NON-R&D) AND LOCAL PARTNER TYPE (STATE OWNED VS. NON-STATE OWNED) ARE IMPORTANT MODERATORS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP. WE FIND SUPPORT FOR OUR ARGUMENTS IN AN ANALYSIS OF 902 ISAS IN THE BRIC (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA) COUNTRIES OVER 1991-2005.

557	AIM. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE OF LAW IN PROTECTING THE JUDICIARY'S ROLE, ESPECIALLY THE INDEPENDENCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION AND ITS FUNCTIONS. METHODS. THE STUDY APPLIES THE CASE STUDY APPROACH AND COMPARATIVE METHOD TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT SYSTEMS OF SOME COUNTRIES OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS (ASEAN) AND THEIR INDEPENDENCE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION. THE RESULTSREVEAL A LACK OF THE JUDICIARY'S INDEPENDENCE, EVEN AMONG THE TOP BRANCHES THAT ARE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT DEMOCRACY IN MYANMAR. THE JUDICIARY IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATURE BRANCHES AS THEIR MEMBERS BELONG TO POLITICAL PARTIES. MOREOVER, A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IS ESTABLISHED WITH THE MEMBERS WHO ARE ELECTED AND NOMINATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND EXECUTIVE. SOMETIMES THERE CAN BE CONFLICTS WHEN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW DOES NOT MENTION THE DIVISION OF POWERS AMONG GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS LIKE MYANMAR, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE IMPRACTICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL OF MYARIRNAR. COGNITIVE VALUE. THIS RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS POSSIBLE WAYS TO SOLVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES AMONG THE THREE GREAT BRANCHES. THIS INITIATIVE IS IN THE INTEREST OF MYANMAR CITIZENS AND CITIZENS OF ALL NATIONS AS THESE ARE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES.
558	THE RULE OF LAW IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND THE CORNERSTONE OF WESTERN DEMOCRACIES AND THEIR PUBLIC GOVERNANCE. ITS UNDERLYING VALUE IS THE IDEA OF CONSTRAINT OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER. THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE ACTS AS AN INTERPRETATIVE CONCEPT IN MOST CONTEXTS OF THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWERS IN THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES, WITH THE COURTS EXERCISING SUPERVISION OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES. HOWEVER, THE TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTATION THROUGH FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES IS NOT INHERENT TO ALL CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES, GIVEN THE LONG TRADITION OF FORMALISTIC APPROACH IN MOST OF THEM. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES WHETHER THE APPROACH HAS CHANGED DURING THE PAST THIRTY YEARS AND TO WHICH LEVEL THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS USED FOR INTERPRETATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROVISIONS BY COURTS IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC. SINCE THE CASE LAW OF THE CZECH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND THE CZECH SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURT IS BASED ON THE ARGUMENTS OF LEGALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY AS THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THEIR CASES WERE ANALYSED USING A COMPARATIVE METHOD. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES A GENERAL TENDENCY IN LEGALLY DIFFICULT CASES TO MOVE FROM PURELY LINGUISTIC INTERPRETATION TO INTERPRETATION THROUGH VALUES, INCLUDING THE RULE OF LAW. MOST OF THE ANALYSED CASES REVEAL THAT THE FORMALISTIC INTERPRETATION WAS STRONGLY CRITICISED BY BOTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND THE SUPREME ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS. HOWEVER, SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND PROPORTIONALITY WERE DISCERNED, NAMELY IN THE DEBATE ON THE INTENSITY OF CONTROL EXERCISED BY ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS OVER FACTUAL AND DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS BY ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES. NEVERTHELESS, THESE DIFFERENCES PRODUCE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS, AS BOTH PRINCIPLES CONTINUE BEING DEVELOPED THANKS TO THE EXCHANGE OF OPINIONS BETWEEN THE COURTS. FURTHER RESEARCH COULD BE CONDUCTED FOR SIMILAR COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.
559	PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY AND AMPLIFY THE VOICE OF THOSE EXPERTS WHO ADVISE PRACTITIONERS FACED WITH FOREIGN MARKET ENTRY DECISIONS. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE IMPORTANCE THAT EXPERTS PLACE ON THE RULE OF LAW, A POSITIVE ETHICAL CLIMATE IN HOST NATIONS AND THE EXPERTS' KNOWLEDGE OF INVESTMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AFTER FIVE YEARS OF THE INITIAL FOREIGN MARKET ENTRY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 12 EXPERIENCED EXPERT PROFESSIONAL INTERVIEWEES WHO SPENT CAREERS WITH PUBLICLY HELD MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, ATTORNEYS WHO ADVISED MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION OFFICERS, ARBITRATORS WITH SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXPERIENCE, CORPORATE ETHICS COMPLIANCE EXPERTS, SMALL GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND AN ACADEMIC SPECIALIZING IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. FINDINGS THE RULE OF LAW AND ETHICAL CLIMATE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE PRIVATE MARKET ENTRY MODE, DISPUTE RESOLUTION CHOICES AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS. FINALLY, THE FINDINGS ILLUMINATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AND A POSITIVE ETHICAL CLIMATE IN PRIVATE FOREIGN MARKET ENTRY DECISIONS AND THEIR MANAGERIAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSITIONS TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT.
560	THE PAPER PRESENTS THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AS A PRINCIPLE. IT MEANS THAT IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE POLITICAL CHOICES. WE TAKE THIS CONCEPTION AND THEN WE AIM TO EXPLAIN HOW IT DEVELOPS WITH RELEVANCE IN A RULE OF LAW AND ITS PROCEDURES. IT WAS ANALYTICALLY PERCEIVED THAT SUCH CONCEPTION IS IDEALIZED BECAUSE IT FAILS TO ADDRESS PRACTICAL PROBLEMS. THE MAIN PROBLEMATIC CONFRONTED IS IN RELATION TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE JUDICIARY, EXEMPLIFIED THROUGH BRAZILIAN CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT POWERS, IN THIS PAPER WE APPROACH, FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE VAQUEJADA CASE. IN ORDER TO TRY TO OVERCOME SUCH PROBLEMS, THE PRESENTED HYPOTHESIS IS THAT A DIALOGIC THEORY CAN PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS BY PROMOTING DIALOGUE THROUGH EQUILIBRIUM AND PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE POWERS AND CITIZENS.
561	THE ESSAY ANALYSES THE RECOGNITION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND IT FOCUSES ON ITS RELATION TO THE NOTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF PROPERTY ESTABLISHED IN THE CONSTITUTIONS OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY AND ITS PROTECTION HAS BECOME THE CRITERION FOR ASSESSING THE STATE OF A COUNTRY'S DEMOCRACY IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL BODIES. CONSIDERING THAT THE GUARANTEE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST THE STATE, WE INTEND TO DEEPEN THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTIONS THAT ASSOCIATE THE TUTELAGE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT. TO THIS END, THE ESSAY EXAMINES THE STANDARDS OF THE RULE OF LAW ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE, MARKED BY DEMOCRACY AND RESPECT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY ESTABLISHED BY COUNCIL OF EUROPE BODIES SUCH AS THE VENICE COMMISSION FOR THE DEMOCRACY THROUGH LAW AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
562	ALTHOUGH THE COURT OF AUDITORS IS AN INSTITUTION WHICH IS VITAL FOR OUR DEMOCRATIC AND SOCIAL STATE GOVERNED BY THE RULE OF LAW, A BETTER COMPREHENSION OF THE BODY FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PERSPECTIVE IS STILL REQUIRED. FIRSTLY, THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE ROLE OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS AS A GUARANTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE. ON THIS ISSUE, IT WILL BE ADVISABLE TO SET UP A MORE DIRECT CONTACT WITH CITIZENS AND A MORE FLUID RELATIONSHIP WITH PARLIAMENT. SECONDLY, THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE FUNDAMENTAL ACTIVITY OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS AS A GUARANTEE OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE, NOT ONLY WHEN THE INSTITUTION PERFORMS ITS AUDIT FUNCTION, BUT ALSO ITS JUDICIAL FUNCTION. IN SPITE OF THE CRITIQUES WHICH THE LAST ONE HAS RECEIVED, IT IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR COMPLETING THE CYCLE OF AUDIT. THIRDLY, THE PAPER UNDERLINES THE RELEVANCE OF THE COURT OF AUDITORS AS A GUARANTEE OF THE SOCIAL ESTATE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF BUDGETARY BALANCE IMPOSES MORE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY ON PUBLIC SPENDING. FINALLY, THE REFORMS PROPOSED BY THE TRIBUNAL DE CONTAS PORTUGUESE AND THE EUROPEAN COURT OF AUDITORS IN THEIR PEER REVIEW OF 2015 ARE ANALYSED. MANY OF THESE SUGGESTIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BY CHANGING THE LAWS WHICH RULE ON THE SPANISH COURT OF AUDITORS. HOWEVER, OTHER PROPOSAL MAY MAKE CONTENIENT A REFORM OF ART. 136 OF OUR CONSTITUTION.
563	RULE OF VIRTUE AND RULE OF LAW ARE INSTITUTIONAL TOOLS FOR MAINTAINING SOCIAL ORDER. THIS PAPER SELECTS TYPICAL CASES RECORDED IN "BIOGRAPHIES OF HONEST AND LAW-ABIDING" IN THE OFFICIAL HISTORY AND SUMMARIZES THE PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES OF THE ANCIENT RULERS IN IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF VIRTUE AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE PRACTICE OF GOVERNANCE. THE HONEST AND UPRIGHT OFFICIALS WITH THE RULE OF VIRTUE AS THE FOUNDATION AIMED TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY, BENEFIT THE PEOPLE AND ENRICH THE PEOPLE, AND THEN TEACH THEM AND PROMOTE ETHICAL INDOCTRINATION. HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT RELY ON INDOCTRINATION ALONE, AND THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE INDOCTRINATED WERE PUNISHED ACCORDING TO LAW. PUNISHMENT WAS BASED ON INDOCTRINATION. LITIGATION WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A PROCESS OF INDOCTRINATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND THE RULE OF VIRTUE AND THE RULE OF LAW WERE INTEGRATED WITH THE PROCESS OF LITIGATION. THROUGH INDOCTRINATION, THE CONFUCIAN IDEAL OF "NO LITIGATION" WAS GRADUALLY ACHIEVED. HOWEVER, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMODITY ECONOMY, SOCIAL PROBLEMS BECAME MORE COMPLEX. SOME LOCAL OFFICIALS WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PURSUE "ZERO LITIGATION" IN ORDER TO FLAUNT THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS, WHICH HOWEVER DEVIATED FROM THE CONFUCIAN CONCEPT OF "BENEVOLENT GOVERNMENT."
564	THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF PERSISTENT ELITE CORRUPTION IN POST-CONFLICT KOSOVO. DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF THE EU RULE OF MISSION (EULEX) SINCE 2008, IT HAS FAILED TO CONVICT PROMINENT OFFICIALS, PERCEPTIONS OF CORRUPTION ARE HIGH, AND PERCEPTIONS OF EULEX PERFORMANCE ARE LOW. THIS STUDY ANALYZES HOW CORRUPT ELITES ARE ABLE TO AVOID PROSECUTION AND RETAIN IMPUNITY. DEPLOYMENT OF EULEX COINCIDED WITH INTERNATIONALLY MEDIATED EFFORTS AT DIALOGUE TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS BETWEEN KOSOVO AND SERBIA. I ARGUE THAT THE DIALOGUE WITH SERBIA CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CORRUPT ELITES TO AVOID PROSECUTION. WITHOUT CREDIBLE THREATS OF VIOLENCE, CORRUPT ELITES USE THE THREAT OF DISRUPTING THE DIALOGUE TO PLAY SPOILERS IN RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT EULEX HAS RESPONDED TO SPOILING SIGNALS FROM ELITES AND REFRAINED FROM PROSECUTING THOSE CAPABLE DISRUPTING THE DIALOGUE.
565	AT A TIME WHEN THE FRAMEWORKS THAT DEFINE THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW WOULD SEEM INSUFFICIENT, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO RETHINK HOW BETTER CONDITIONS CAN BE CREATED FOR A SOCIETY TIRED OF THE INACTION OF ITS AUTHORITIES. THIS ARTICLE RAISES SOME REFLECTIONS AND EXPOSES TWO EXAMPLES REGARDING THE ROLE PLAYED BY THOSE LEGAL ACTORS WHOSE WORK, IN GENERAL, USUALLY GOES UNNOTICED BY THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN WHICH THEY ARE INSERTED; THAT IS, THE LAWYERS. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT REFER TO ANY TYPE OF LAWYERS BUT TO ONE PARTICULARLY COMMITTED TO SOCIAL ACTION TO STRENGTHEN THE RULES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT SUSTAIN DEMOCRACIES.
566	THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS KEY CHARACTERISTICS AS A PRINCIPLE WITHIN PUBLIC GOVERNANCE MODEL (PGM) RESEARCH. IN THE STUDY, WE ANALYZED TWO MAIN EU CULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL SUBGROUPS, SELECTED OLD AND NEW EU MEMBER STATES, IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN CONVERGENCES AND DIFFERENCES CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RESPECTIVE CLUSTERS. WITH THE ACCESSION TO THE EUROPEAN UNION, THESE ACCEDING COUNTRIES WERE TO TRANSFER EU LAW INTO NATIONAL LAW AND REFORM THEIR GOVERNANCE MODELS ACCORDINGLY. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS ACHIEVED BY FOLLOWING AN ORIGINAL METHODOLOGY, ENCOMPASSING 431 RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC PAPERS FROM THE SCOPUS DATABASE. THE KNOWN QDA MINER 5.0.11 SOFTWARE PACKAGE WAS SELECTED AS THE MAIN TOOL FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE AIMED AT COVERING: (I) THE ROLE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS ONE OF THE KEY GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES IN RELATION TO THE COUNTRIES' HISTORICAL LEGACY AND DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE MODELS, (II) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND (HI) OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH WITHIN THE TWO SELECTED GEOGRAPHICAL SUBGROUPS. THE RESULTS, CONCERNING THE FIRST RESEARCH QUESTION, REVEAL A GREATER FREQUENCY OF PAPERS PER YEAR ABOUT THE RELEVANT PGM STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE OLD EU MEMBER STATES. LIKELY, DUE TO A BROADER SOCIO-ADMINISTRATIVE TRADITION WITHIN THESE COUNTRIES, LAW-RELATED TOPICS ARE BETTER COVERED. AS REGARDS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RULE OF LAW AS A PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANTLY RELATED TO EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND PA REFORMS AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN AS AN ANTIPODE TO EFFICIENCY. IN NEW EU MS, I.E. CENTRAL AND EAST EUROPE (CEE), IN PARTICULAR THE RULE OF LAW IN ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS IS ALSO ONE OF THE SALIENT ELEMENTS OF THE ON-GOING TRANSITIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO THE OLD WESTERN DEMOCRACIES. HOWEVER, WITHIN THE PROCESSES OF PRIVATIZATION, GLOBALIZATION AND MARKETIZATION, THE RULE OF LAW IS CHALLENGED; EVEN WITH PAR THAT MIGHT UNDERMINE THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. WHILE DEMANDING FURTHER RESEARCH, ENCOMPASSING SPECIFIC SOCIO-ECONOMIC NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS AND AN EVALUATION OF LEGAL AND RELATED HIGHLY IMPORTANT REFORM PRECONDITIONS PROVES VITAL FOR TOMORROW'S PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY COPING WITH THE NEEDS OF THE MODERN SOCIETY.
567	THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA SHOULD BE ADVANCED UNDER A SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK. THE SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK ON WHICH THE CHINESE RULE OF LAW RELIES IS SHAPED BY THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. SOCIALIST CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY, WHICH RESPONDS TO THE CORE THEMES OF THE DETERMINANT OF SOCIALISM, PARTY LEADERSHIP, THE DEMOCRATIC TRADITION OF NEW CHINA AND NATIVE RESOURCES FOR CONSTRUCTING THE RULE OF LAW, IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR CONSTRUCTING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. IN A CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF "RULING PARTY-POLITICAL POWER-THE PEOPLE" THAT TAKES THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE AS THE LOGIC OF ITS STARTING POINT, CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY PLAYS THE ROLE OF FUNCTIONAL COUPLING. POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY GAINS POLITICAL LEGITIMACY ON THE BASIS OF MULTI-PARTY COOPERATION AND POLITICAL CONSULTATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CPC, THUS TRANSLATING THE WILL OF THE RULING PARTY INTO THE WILL OF THE STATE. CONSULTATIVE DEMOCRACY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PROCESS IN NATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, AFFORDING A BASIS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE INHERENT LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF "RULING PARTY-CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE-PEOPLE'S CONGRESS." THE DEMOCRATIC SUPERVISION EXERCISED BY THE CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE IS AN EXTENSION OF POLITICAL CONSULTATION; FROM IT UNFOLDS THE SYSTEMS FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA.
568	INDUSTRIALIZATION IS FUELED BY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, WHICH RAISES THE VALUE OF OBTAINED NATURAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, EXPLOITATION AND EXCESSIVE USAGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN VARIOUS SECTORS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS (CO2), NATURAL RESOURCE RENTS, RULE OF LAW, DIGITALIZATION, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH (GDP) IN (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA, AND SOUTH AFRICA) BRICS BETWEEN 1990 AND 2021. THE EMPIRICAL FINDINGS BASED ON THE METHOD OF MOMENT QUANTILE REGRESSION (MMQREG) CONFIRM THAT GDP AND NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH CO2 EMISSIONS, INDICATING THAT THESE TWO VARIABLES ADVERSELY AFFECT CARBON EMISSIONS IN BRICS COUNTRIES. INTERESTINGLY, THE OUTCOMES ALSO REVEAL THAT DIGITALIZATION AND EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW TACKLE THE ISSUE OF CO2 EMISSIONS EFFECTIVELY THROUGHOUT ALL QUANTILES. MOREOVER, THE ROBUSTNESS CHECKS OF FULLY-MODIFIED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (FMOLS), AND DYNAMIC ORDINARY LEAST SQUARE (DOLS) CONFIRM AND SUPPORT THE OUTCOMES OF MMQREG. BASED ON THE STUDY FINDINGS, WE PROPOSE THAT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES OF BRICS MEMBER COUNTRIES DO NOT EFFICIENTLY TACKLE CO2 EMISSIONS. TO COPE WITH CARBON EMISSIONS AND RESOURCE EXPLOITATION, THE SELECTED NATIONS SHOULD RESTRUCTURE THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES-RELATED POLICIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT BY PRIORITIZING THE EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND ADOPTING CLEAN AND GREEN ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH.
569	THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE PRACTICE OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT WITH REGARD TO HIS/HER POLICY OF POSITIVE COMPLEMENTARITY. THIS POLICY AIMS AT ENCOURAGING DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE PERPETRATORS OF CORE INTERNATIONAL CRIMES. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, THE PROSECUTOR CAN ACT AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE PROCEEDINGS. FIRST AT THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION PHASE, WHERE HE/SHE WILL DETERMINE IF CONDITIONS OF ADMISSIBILITY ARE MET, AND SECONDLY AT THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION PHASES OF THE PROCEEDINGS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE ABILITY OF THE PROSECUTOR TO PURSUE SUCH A POLICY IS REAL, BUT LIMITED, AS HIS/HER CORE MANDATE, IS TO BRING PERPETRATORS OF INTERNATIONAL CRIMES BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY OF POSITIVE COMPLEMENTARITY MUST BE ENVISIONED IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER ACTORS WORKING ON RULE OF LAW PROGRAMS. IN THIS RESPECT, THE PROSECUTOR MUST ENGAGE IN COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS.
570	THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE TYPE OF FUTURE WORLD ORDER, WHICH BEST CORRESPONDS TO MODERN HUMANISTIC VALUES AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS THE MAIN OBSTACLES AND POSSIBLE WAYS TO IMPLEMENT IT. THE ARTICLE IS DELIBERATELY STRUCTURED AS A POLITICAL-PHILOSOPHICAL AND DEBATABLE ONE; THERE ARE NO SPECIAL EMPIRICAL SUBSTANTIATIONS AND DETAILED THEORIZING IN IT. THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS HOW THE NOTORIOUS "ANARCHY" OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS CAN BE RESTRICTED ON CONSISTENT LEGAL GROUNDS, AS IS REQUIRED BY THE ACUTENESS AND SCALE OF CONTEMPORARY CONFLICTS. THE MAIN MILESTONES FOR THE PROMOTION OF LAW IDEAS IN MATTERS OF WAR AND PEACE WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE CONTRIBUTION OF RUSSIAN INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE NINETEENTH - EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES ARE PRESENTED. THE AUTHOR SHOWS WHY THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONS (HEADED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL) FAIL TO COPE WITH THE URGENT TASKS OF WAR PREVENTION, AND REVIEWS THE MAIN REFORM PROJECTS, MOST OF WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. THE MAIN THESIS IS THAT GEOPOLITICS (THE SPHERE OF WAR AND PEACE, TERRITORIAL DISPUTES) SHOULD BE REGULATED BY A SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE UN, THE ENFORCEABILITY OF WHOSE VERDICTS CAN AND SHOULD BE ENSURED BY A COALITION OF LEADING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL POWERS. IN THIS CASE, DIPLOMACY AND MILITARY, COERCIVE ACTIONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA WILL LOSE THEIR CURRENT PRIMACY IN GEOPOLITICS. THEY WILL ASSUME AN AUXILIARY ROLE IN RELATION TO THE LAW, TO THE ACTIVITIES AND VERDICTS OF AN AUTHORITATIVE COURT (INCLUDING IN THE SPHERE OF SANCTIONS, REPARATIONS, FORCE ACTIONS). THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH AN ORDER ARE CONSIDERED, AS WELL AS THE WAYS TO OVERCOME THEM AND THE STAGES OF PROGRESS TOWARDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN GLOBAL AND REGIONAL GEOPOLITICS.
571	IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POLAND-EU CONFLICT OVER THE RULE OF LAW I INTERVIEWED SELECTED POLISH MEMBERS OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT [MEPS] ON EU INTEGRATION IN THE PEAK OF THE CONTROVERSY IN 2018. DRAWING FROM DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND "PRACTICE TURN" IN EUROPEAN STUDIES I STUDIED THE MEPS NARRATIVES. THEY APPEARED TO BE DEEPLY ROOTED IN TWO DISCOURSES: NEOFUNCTIONALISM AND INTERGOVERNMENTALISM, BOTH CONSIDERED AS DOMINANT NARRATIVES IN THE EU STUDIES. AS RIGHT-WING MEPS WERE CONVINCED THE EU WAS POLITICALLY BIASED, PROTECTING SOVEREIGNTY PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THEIR NARRATIVES REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW CONFLICT. THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE'S PARTY [EPP] AND SOCIALISTS AND DEMOCRATS [S&D] MEPS EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO ABIDE BY EU RULES, BUT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARDS IMPOSING SANCTIONS AGAINST POLAND WAS MIXED. IN THE RULE OF LAW CONFLICT THEY DIDN'T FIRMLY STAND BY ITS SIDE AS A POLITY PROTECTING ITS LAWS. THE NOTION OF SOVEREIGNTY SHOWED CLEAVAGES IN THEIR NARRATIVES, USUALLY FULL OF BELIEF IN THE SUPRANATIONAL COMMUNITY OF VALUES.
572	THE JUNCKER COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY INDICATED THAT THE EXPERIENCED GAINED FROM THE COOPERATION AND VERIFICATION MECHANISM (CVM) IS RELEVANT WHEN ADDRESSING RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES IN ALL MEMBER STATES. IT HAS ALSO PROPOSED TO MONITOR THE RULE OF LAW IN ALL MEMBER STATES. BULGARIA AND ROMANIA ARE THE ONLY EU MEMBERS WHICH ARE SUBJECTED TO THE CVM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT FULLY FULFILL THE ACCESSION CRITERIA ON THE RULE OF LAW WHEN THEY ACCEDED TO THE UNION IN 2007. IN 2018, THE JUNCKER COMMISSION IDENTIFIED IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN BULGARIA AND PROMISED TO LIFT THE MECHANISM FOR THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM. YET, HAS THE CVM HELPED BULGARIA STRENGTHEN ITS RULE OF LAW? BY USING BULGARIA'S CVM AS A CASE STUDY, THIS ARTICLE SHOWCASES SOME OF THE PITFALLS OF THIS MECHANISM, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF THE COMMISSION'S MONITORING - NAMELY, THAT BULGARIA'S RULE OF LAW DECLINED DESPITE THE CVM. DISSECTING THIS PHENOMENON IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST IN LIGHT OF THE COMMISSION'S OWN CALL TO STUDY THE EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THE CVM, BUT ALSO IN VIEW OF GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT DUAL STANDARDS IN ENFORCING EU VALUES IN THE UNION.
573	THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MIGHT AND RIGHT IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. VARIOUS IDEOLOGIES AND CORRESPONDING PRACTICES HAVE BEEN PUT AWARD BY REALISM, LIBERALISM, CONSTRUCTIVISM, AND INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM UNDER BOTH WESTERN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORIES AND CHINA'S TRADITIONAL WANG DAO ("THE KINGLY WAY" OR "BENEVOLENT GOVERNMENT"), AND BA DAO ("THE HEGETNONIC WAY" OR "RULE BY FORCE'). IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, THE RULE OF LAW- A PHENOMENON THAT HAS EMERGED AND IS CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPING - IS CONDUCIVE TO RESTRAINING POWER POLITICS AND PROMOTING RIGHT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOATS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS DEVELOPMENT. CHINA HAS ALWAYS OPPOSED HEGEMONY AND POWER POLITICS; IT FIRMLY SUPPORTS A MODERN SYSTEM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW BASED ON THE PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER AND AIMS TO BUILD A NEW INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER WITH PEACE, JUSTICE, AND STABILITY.
574	ARTIFICIAL LEGAL INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY DEVELOPED TO PERFORM VARIOUS LEGAL TASKS. HOWEVER, RARE DISCUSSIONS FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SUCH DEVELOPMENT MIGHT CONFLICT WITH THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE I ARGUE THAT THERE IS AN INTERNAL TENSION BETWEEN ALIS AND THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON TWO REASONS. FIRST, THE IDEA OF A LEGAL SUBJECT IN THE RULE OF LAW IS CONCEIVED AS AN ACTIVE, RESPONSIBLE, AND ANSWERABLE AGENT WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY FOR MAKING A DECISION. THE FACT THAT ALIS BECOME MORE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING LEGAL TASKS EVENTUALLY LEADS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SHIFTING THE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY AWAY FROM HUMAN. THE RULE OF LAW DRAWS A BASELINE FOR DEVELOPING ALIS, THAT IS, ALIS SHOULD BE SUPPLEMENTARY, NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR HUMAN. SECONDLY, THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT MECHANISM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, ONE OF THE CORE FEATURES IN ALIS, SEVERELY DECREASES AN INDIVIDUAL'S AUTONOMOUS SPHERE OF MORAL REASONING FOR ALIS SEEK FOR AN ASSURANCE THAT AN AGENT WOULD COMPLY WITH LAW THROUGH THE CERTAINTY OF LEGAL SANCTIONS. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THIS MECHANISM, ALIS AIM AT INFLUENCING AN INDIVIDUAL'S AUTONOMY OF RANKING REASONS. BASED ON THE TWO ARGUMENTS, I DEMONSTRATE THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPLE ON THE REGULATION OF ALIS. THE FIRST PRINCIPLE PROHIBITS THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTITUTE ALI. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE PROHIBITS THE WIDELY ADOPTION OF HIGHLY EFFICIENT MECHANISM OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AGE OF AI FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY.
575	THERE IS NO INSTANCE IN A GIVEN SOCIETY THAT CAN SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE AND FUNCTION WITHOUT RESPECTING EXISTING STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES SET IN PLACE IN ENSURING THE RESPECT OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGNITY. CAMEROON AND UKRAINE HAVE ENGAGED HUGE STEPS IN ESTABLISHING CREDIBLE LAWS, ALL IN THE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT OF THOSE PRESUMED OF THE CRIME COMMISSION. THIS ARTICLE ESTABLISHES THAT THE ONLY WAY THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE RESPECTED DURING THE INVESTIGATIVE STAGE, WILL ONLY WHEN THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATION RESPECTS THE DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW IN THE COURSE OF ITS INVESTIGATION SO THAT THEM ACT SHOULD NOT CONTRAVENE THE RIGHT OF THE SUSPECT OR ACCUSED IN QUESTION. IT PROVIDES THAT WHEN ISSUES OF INVESTIGATION ARE CARRIED OUT BY UKRAINE AND CAMEROON POLICE, GROSS VIOLATIONS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS ARE ALWAYS EXPERIENCED, AND THIS GREATLY AFFECTS THE OBJECTIVE OF CRIMINAL LAW IS THAT OF PROTECTING THE RIGHT AND DIGNITY OF EVERYONE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE STATUS QUO ACQUIRED DURING THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. THE RESULTS OF THIS GROSS VIOLATION OF THE ACCUSED RIGHTS AND STATUS DURING THE INVESTIGATIVE STAGE WILL AFFECT THE RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE CRIMINAL LAW SYSTEM WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CRIMINAL PROCESSES SHOULD RESPECT HUMAN STANDARDS AND DIGNITY. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT, DURING THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MUST BE ABLE IN DETACHING THEIR VARIOUS DUTIES ASSIGNED WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS CRIMINAL STANDARDS OF INVESTIGATION. TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS DONE, THERE IS THAT NEED OF THOSE ENFORCING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS AND TRIAL SHOULD THAT ALL EVIDENCE, SEARCHES, SEIZURES, RECORDING DONE BY THE INVESTIGATIVE POLICE OFFICIALS SHOULD BE DONE IN ACCORDANCE OF THE FREE WILL OF THE PRESUMED CRIMINAL.
576	THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW MUST BE CENTERED IN THE PERSON OF THE CITIZEN, BOTH IN ITS INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSION, FROM WHICH DERIVE THEIR RIGHTS AND DUTIES. AS A RESULT, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL RELATIONSHIP MUST BUILD ITSELF BASED ON THE SERVITUDE OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN THE PURSUIT OF THE COMMON GOOD.
577	THE UNSTOPPABLE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES OPERATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POSES A REGULATORY CHALLENGE OF CONSIDERABLE SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW. BEYOND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT NEW DIGITAL TOOLS CAN BRING FOR SOCIAL PROGRESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, OPAQUE AND UNCONTROLLED USES OF AIS CAN CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO THE RIGHTS AND VALUES THAT UNDERPIN OUR SOCIETY AND, IN PARTICULAR, TO EQUALITY BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF ALGORITHMIC GENDER BIASES AND THE REGULATORY PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD TO TRY TO NEUTRALIZE THEM.
578	WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CJEU'S ACHMEA JUDGMENT HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DAMAGE BEYOND THE TERMINATION OF INTRA-EU BITS. IT MADE THE APPLICATION OF EU LAW DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. INDEED, IT HAS OPENED THE FLOODGATE TO DEFICIENT JUDICIAL PROTECTION IN THE FACE OF STRUCTURAL BACKSLIDING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SOME EU MEMBER STATES. WHILE THE MOTIVES OF THE CJEU AND BY EXTENSION THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO SAFEGUARD THEIR ULTIMATE CONTROL OVER THE INTERNAL MARKET BY EXCLUSIVELY RELYING ON THE PRELIMINARY RULING SYSTEM OF INTEGRATED EUROPEAN JUDICIARY MAY BE UNDERSTANDABLE, THEY CANNOT SERVE AS A CREDIBLE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF DISEMPOWERING INVESTORS IN THE NAME OF AN IDEOLOGICAL STANCE REGARDING EU JUDICIARY, WHICH CANNOT WORK IN THE BACKSLIDING MEMBER STATES, WHERE THE 'INTEGRATION OF THE EU'S JUDICIARY' COULD STAND FOR THE ABSENCE OF INDEPENDENT ADJUDICATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACHMEA JUDGMENT AND POST-ACHMEA DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS THE RECENTLY SIGNED TERMINATION AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE INTRA-EU BITS HAVE BEEN LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT-POSSIBLY IRREPARABLE IN THE SHORT- TO MEDIUM-TERM-LOWERING OF THE PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE PROTECTION STANDARDS FOR EUROPEAN INVESTORS IN TIMES WHEN THEY ARE IN NEED OF MORE RATHER THAN LESS PROTECTION.
579	POLITICAL THEORY HAS DESCRIBED A POSITIVE LINKAGE BETWEEN EDUCATION, COGNITIVE ABILITY AND DEMOCRACY. THIS ASSUMPTION IS CONFIRMED BY POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN EDUCATION, COGNITIVE ABILITY, AND POSITIVELY VALUED POLITICAL CONDITIONS (N=183 - 130). LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL (N=94 - 16) ALLOW THE ANALYSIS OF CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS. IT IS SHOWN THAT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY, EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENCE HAD A STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT ON DEMOCRACY, RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL LIBERTY INDEPENDENT FROM WEALTH (GDP) AND CHOSEN COUNTRY SAMPLE. ONE POSSIBLE MEDIATOR OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS IS THE ATTAINMENT OF HIGHER STAGES OF MORAL JUDGMENT FOSTERED BY COGNITIVE ABILITY, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION OF DEMOCRATIC RULES IN SOCIETY. THE OTHER MEDIATORS FOR CITIZENS AS WELL AS FOR LEADERS COULD BE THE INCREASED COMPETENCE AND WILLINGNESS TO PROCESS AND SEEK INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR POLITICAL DECISIONS DUE TO GREATER COGNITIVE ABILITY. THERE ARE ALSO WEAKER AND LESS STABLE REVERSE EFFECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL FREEDOM ON COGNITIVE ABILITY. (C) 2007 ELSEVIER INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
580	THE UK PROUDLY DESCRIBES ITS LONGSTANDING COMMITMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AS A SIGN OF ITS BROADER COMMITMENT TO INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION AND, IN TURN, THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE CALLS INTO QUESTION THIS NARRATIVE SUGGESTING THAT, DESPITE OFFICIAL PLEDGES AND RHETORIC TO THE CONTRARY, THE UK CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE TRULY ACCEPTED THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT TO SCRUTINIZE ITS CONDUCT, NOR TO HAVE CONSISTENTLY ACTED IN A MANNER THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF THAT INSTITUTION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE UK WISHES TO PRESENT ITSELF AS A GENUINE SUPPORTER OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE POSITS THAT IT SHOULD REFORMULATE ITS APPROACH TO THE COURT WITH REGARD TO BOTH ITS CONTENTIOUS AND ADVISORY JURISDICTIONS.
581	BEYOND SETTING THE STAGE, THE INTRODUCTION MAKES THREE CLAIMS ABOUT THE CONCEPTUAL TRIANGLE OF THE RULE OF LAW, JUDICIAL AUTHORITY AND LEGITIMACY. THE FIRST IS THAT ALL THREE ARE ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED AND INTERPRETIVE CONCEPTS IN THE SENSE OF WALTER B. GALLIE AND RONALD DWORKIN. IN THEIR EXPOSITIONS, THE CONTESTED AND INTERPRETATIVE NATURE OF SUCH CONCEPTS IS NOTHING TO BE 'SOLVED', RATHER THE FORMULATION OF DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS AND CONTESTATION ABOUT THEM ARE CENTRAL FUNCTIONS OF SUCH CONCEPTS. THE INTERPRETIVE AND ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED NATURE POINTS US TO THE RELEVANT 'ACTORS' AND TO CONFLICTS AND TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN CONTESTED COMPETENCIES. THUS THE SECOND POINT IS THAT ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY ARE OFTEN A MEANS OF QUESTIONING OR SECURING THE AUTHORITY OF A PARTICULAR ACTOR OR INSTITUTION IN RELATION TO OTHER ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS. THE FINAL POINT IS THAT TRANSPOSING CONCEPTS FROM THE DOMESTIC TO THE SUPRANATIONAL IS A CONSTRUCTIVE ENDEAVOUR BECAUSE IT ENTAILS CREATING NEW CONCEPTIONS AND SUBSTITUTING OLD ONES AS WELL AS LEGITIMISING NEW AUTHORITIES AND DELEGITIMISING OLD ONES. THUS, THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ALSO CAUTIONS AGAINST DISCOURSES THAT ULTIMATELY ARE MORE ABOUT LEGITIMATION THAN ABOUT LEGITIMACY AND MORE ABOUT NEW WAYS OF RULING THAN THE RULE OF LAW.
582	THE PAPER GIVES NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION POLICY, DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF AN INVERSE U-SHAPED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION AND INCOME IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL THIS RELATIONSHIP TO BE INFLUENCED BY ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO SHIFTING THE TURNING POINT ON THE CURVE TO LOWER INCOME LEVELS. WE SHOW THAT FORMER TRANSITION ECONOMIES HAVE NOT REACHED THE TURNING POINT DUE TO WEAK INSTITUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY'S ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION REFORM, PROPOSING TO SHIFT TAXATION FROM GOODS TO BADS, SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OR THE RULE OF LAW. THE HETEROGENEITY FOUND BETWEEN MARKET-BASED AND FORMER TRANSITION EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DEMONSTRATES THE EXISTENCE OF PROBLEMS AT THE EU-LEVEL IN THE COORDINATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW. IN ADDITION, THE ANALYSIS OF THE DETERMINANTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TAXATION POINTS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS RELATED TO CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION, GOVERNANCE, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, OIL PRICE SHOCKS AND THE SHIFT OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
583	THIS PAPER GIVES A THICKER ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW REFORMS INITIATED BY GLOBAL SOUTH DONORS. COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL GLOBAL NORTH DONORS, WHO TAKE A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, EMERGING DONORS FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH TAKE AN APPROACH OF MUTUAL COOPERATION. DONORS FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH ARE MORE OPEN TO ACCOMMODATE LEGAL PLURALISM, AS WELL AS TAKE A PROLONGED APPROACH OF ASSISTANCE. THEY ARE WILLING TO BUILD NETWORKS WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS DRAWING ON THEIR POST-COLONIAL AND DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORIES. USING A CASE STUDY OF BRAZILIAN LEGAL ASSISTANCE WITHIN THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS' OFFICE THROUGH THE ABC IN EAST TIMOR, THE AUTHOR SHOWS HOW NON-TRADITIONAL INTERNATIONAL DONORS HAS SUBVERTED THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF 'RULE OF LAW' ASSISTANCE. THIS PAPER BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE SCHOLARSHIP ON THE SOUTH- SOUTH COOPERATION WITHIN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AND THE LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP ON LAW AND DEVELOPMENT- FOCUSING ON THE RULE OF LAW REFORMS. USING EMPIRICAL DATA, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES THE DISTINCTIVE APPROACHES UNDERTAKEN BY THE BRAZILIAN INTERNATIONAL ACTORS WITHIN EAST TIMOR. FURTHER, IT POSES QUESTIONS ON THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE RULE OF LAW REFORMS ADVOCATED BY TRADITIONAL DONORS BY DEMONSTRATING THE EMERGENCE OF PERIPHERAL INTERESTS FROM THE ENGAGEMENT OF DONORS FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
584	IS CHINA'S "SOCIALIST RULE BY LAW"( ) QUALIFIED TO BE CALLED "RULE OF LAW"( ) OR A "THIN RULE OF LAW"PROPOSED BY RANDALL PEEREMBOON, WITHOUT ABOLISHING THE POLITICAL SUPREMACY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY? SINCE THE MID- 1990S, THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM AND ITS JUDICIARY HAVE GONE THROUGH REFORMS AND ON THE WHOLE MODERNIZED. HOWEVER, THE CHINESE JUDICIARY STILL FACES MANY PROBLEMS, AND AMONG THEM THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL JURISTS, CORRUPTION AND LOCAL PROTECTIONISM APPEAR AS CRUCIAL ONES. THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND LACK OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION CLEARLY INTENSIFY THESE PROBLEMS. "RULE OF LAW"( ) OR "RULE BY LAW"( ) IN CHINA IS STILL MORE OFTEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE RESPECTIVE POLITICAL, BUREAUCRATIC AND ECONOMIC POWERS OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED THAN ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES OF LAW OR EQUITY. THE MODERNIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE, BUT THE POLITICAL TRANSLATION OF THE LEGAL DEMANDS OF SOCIETY AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL TAKE TIME TO MATERIALIZE. IN THE MEANTIME, RISKS, SETBACKS AND DIFFICULTIES WILL CONTINUE TO PREVENT CHINA FROM ESTABLISHING A TRULY INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND WHAT IS UNIVERSALLY CALLED A RULE OF LAW.
585	TORTURE IS A WIDELY DIFFUSED PRACTICE IN MEXICO, AS HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR DECADES BY CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS, UNITED NATIONS BODIES AND SPECIAL PROCEDURES, AND THE NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION. ALTHOUGH TORTURE HAS BEEN USED IN VARIOUS CONTEXTS, ITS USE IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, AS AN 'ILLEGAL' METHOD OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO OBTAIN CONFESSIONS AND INCRIMINATING STATEMENTS, HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY DENOUNCED OVER THE YEARS. ENCOURAGED BY OLD COURT CRITERIA, THAT TRANSLATED INTO THE LACK OF REAL JUDICIAL CONTROL, PROSECUTORS HAVE HAD NO INCENTIVE TO DEVELOP INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES ON THE BASIS OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE AND EXCLUDING TORTURE FROM THEIR METHODS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE POSSIBILITY TO DEVELOP INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITIES TO ENFORCE THE LAW ACCORDING TO HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY UNDERMINED. WITH THAT IN MIND, THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYSE WHETHER THE SYSTEMATIC VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION OF TORTURE (A JUS COGENS NORM) BY THE MEXICAN STATE HAS HAD IN IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING IN ITS SUBSTANTIVE DIMENSION, THAT IS, THE 'DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW'.
586	AFTER DECADES OF DISAPPOINTING PROGRESS IN BUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN SOCIETIES THAT SUFFER FROM POORLY FUNCTIONING LEGAL SYSTEMS, THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO LEGAL PLURALISM. LEGAL PLURALISM IS A PROMINENT FEATURE IN MANY DEVELOPMENT CONTEXTS, WITH BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THE NEGATIVE QUESTIONS REVOLVE AROUND WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE COEXISTING LEGAL FORMS HAMPERS OR DETRACTS FROM EFFORTS TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW. THE POSITIVE QUESTIONS REVOLVE AROUND WHETHER ALTERNATIVE LEGAL FORMS IN SITUATIONS OF LEGAL PLURALISM MIGHT SATISFY RULE OF LAW FUNCTIONS THAT FAILING STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THESE QUESTIONS.
587	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, EFFORTS BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM (CPV) TO BUILD A "SOCIALIST" RULE OF LAW THROUGH LEGAL AND JUDICIAL REFORMS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VIBRANT CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICS IN THE COUNTRY. DURING THE PROCESS OF AMENDING THE 1992 CONSTITUTION, THE SOCIALIST THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION QUIETLY SHIFTED AS A RESULT OF NEW THINKING AND VALUES. THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS OF OLD AND NEW IDEOLOGICAL PRECEPTS WERE PROMINENTLY REFLECTED BY THE CHANGING DISCOURSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS DURING DEBATES ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THE 1992 CONSTITUTION. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE "SOCIALIST" RULE OF LAW AND THE CHANGES TAKING PLACE IN THE DISCOURSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS DURING THE CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROCESS IN VIETNAM. IN SETTING OUT THE CONTEXT AND CONTENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM, IT SEEKS TO DECONSTRUCT THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW AND INTERPRET THE DISCOURSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACCORDINGLY. IN DOING SO, THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SOCIALIZED WILL BE UNPACKED TO MAKE SENSE OF SUBTLE CHANGES IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE. FURTHERMORE, THE PAPER AIMS TO UNCOVER THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH A CHANGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIETNAM'S HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME.
588	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES. AS A CASE STUDY, IT EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ABORTION LAW IN POLAND. THE ARTICLE MAKES THREE PRIMARY CLAIMS. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND CAME CLEARLY INTO VIEW THROUGH THE ABORTION JUDGMENT K 1/20, HANDED DOWN BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL TRIBUNAL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE JUDGMENT AND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS ISSUED AND PUBLISHED ARE INTERPRETED AS REFLECTIONS OF DEEP-LYING PROCESSES AND PROBLEMS IN POLISH SOCIETY. CONSEQUENTLY, SECOND, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORY OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN RECENT DECADES IN POLAND REVEALS WEAK INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS MANIFEST IN THE WAYS IN WHICH DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL GROUPS, ESPECIALLY DOCTORS AND LAWYERS, HAVE ADDRESSED QUESTIONS REGARDING ABORTION LAW. THEREFORE, THIRD, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW POWERFUL PROFESSIONAL ACTORS AND ORGANIZATIONS INTERACT WITH THE LAW. THE POLISH CASE STUDY SHOWS THAT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS SHOULD BE SEEN AS IMPORTANT PARTS OF A "LITMUS TEST," WHICH WE CAN USE TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS AND THE QUALITY OF THE DEMOCRACIES IN WHICH SUCH TRANSITIONS RESULT.
589	AN INTERACTIVE CDR INDEX COMBINES THE DEGREE OF CAPITALISM, DEMOCRACY, AND RULE OF LAW ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR COUNTRY. IN PREVIOUS WORK, DEPICTIONS OF THE CDR INDEX AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT WERE BASED ON APPROXIMATE TRENDS. NO FORMAL MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A FORMAL MEASUREMENT OF THE CDR INDEX BASED ON PUBLISHED COUNTRY MARKET CAPITALIZATION, RANKINGS IN DEMOCRACY, AND RANKINGS IN CORRUPTION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF INTERACTIONS. CONSISTENT WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY, THE CDR INDEX EXPLAINS PER CAPITA REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ADJUSTED FOR PURCHASING POWER PARITY (G) WITH ONLY THREE VARIABLES. WE SHOW THAT G IS A FUNCTION OF THE CDR INDEX AS EVIDENCE THAT A NATIONAL POLICY SHOULD FOCUS ON RAISING A COUNTRY'S CDR INDEX, WHETHER OR NOT IT IS RESOURCE RICH. COUNTRIES WITH A LOW CDR INDEX FARE POORLY IN WEALTH EVEN WHEN THEY ARE RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCES. WHILE THE IMPORTANCE OF CAPITALISM, DEMOCRACY, AND RULE OF LAW APPEAR TO REMAIN ELUSIVE TO ECONOMICALLY UNSUCCESSFUL COUNTRIES, GOVERNMENTS DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEANS FOR RAISING THEM EXOGENOUSLY.
590	REVIEWING LITERATURE ON RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE PUTS FORWARD A 'BOTTOM-UP' APPROACH OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT ENCOURAGES AN ANALYSIS OF THREE ASPECTS (I) THE ABILITY OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO CONFER THE CAPACITY OF SELF-DETERMINATION UPON INDIVIDUALS (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS RECIPROCAL/ INTERACTIONAL, IN THAT IT CREATES EXPECTATIONS BETWEEN GOVERNING AND GOVERNED AND (III) THE CONTRIBUTION MADE BY ORDINARY INDIVIDUALS IN THE FORM OF PARTICIPATION WITH OR CONTRIBUTION TO COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE AND LAW IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THE PAPER THEN APPLIES THIS FRAMEWORK TO THE LAW AND RULES IN APPLICATION IN TERRITORY UNDER THE CONTROL OF ARMED GROUPS, CONSIDERING INDIVIDUALS' RELATIONSHIP WITH RULES IN THESE SPACES AND EXAMINING THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THEY MAY AFFECT CIVILIANS' LIVES.
591	THIS PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER U.S.-STYLE JUDICIAL SUPREMACY SATISFIES THE STANDARDS OF POLITICAL MORALITY THAT FALL UNDER THE RUBRIC OF "THE RULE OF LAW." THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT ARISE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED: 1) WHAT, EXACTLY, IS THE RULE OF LAW (HEREINAFTER, ROL)? 2) HOW DOES ROL CONNECT WITH OTHER STANDARDS OF NORMATIVE POLITICAL MORALITY RELEVANT WITH RESPECT TO EVALUATING JUDICIAL AND OTHER LEGAL PRACTICES? 3) IS THERE ANY REASON TO THINK THAT JUDICIAL SUPREMACY IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RELEVANT ROL STANDARDS? 4) ASSUMING AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO 3, WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT WHETHER JUDICIAL SUPREMACY IS MORALLY JUSTIFIED? I TAKE THE PROCEDURAL/FUNCTIONAL CONCEPTION OF F.A. HAYEK AS MY WORKING CONCEPTION OF ROL AND CONSIDER WHETHER JUDICIAL SUPREMACY RUNS AFOUL OF THE RELEVANT PRINCIPLES. ALTHOUGH THIS PAPER IS SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED WITH AN OSTENSIBLE TENSION BETWEEN JUDICIAL SUPREMACY AND THE RELEVANT ROL PRINCIPLES, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE ANALYSIS IS A GESTURE IN THE DIRECTION EXPLICATING THE REAL MORAL ISSUE AND HOW IT GOES BEYOND ROL CONSIDERATIONS.
592	ACCORDING TO THE PREVAILING DIFFUSION APPROACHES, NORMS AND INSTITUTIONAL MODELS IN THE INTERNATIONAL REALM EMERGE AND ARE DIFFUSED THROUGH TRANSNATIONAL ADVOCACY NETWORKS. ACCORDING TO LOCALISATION RESEARCH, THEY ARE ADOPTED AND CHANGED BY LOCAL ACTORS, WHO ADJUST THEM TO FIT THEIR INTERESTS AND NORMATIVE CONTEXT. NEITHER APPROACH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE CYCLICAL ELEMENT OF TRANSLATION. RATHER, THEY BOTH PRESENT UNIDIRECTIONAL MODELS OF DIFFUSION. FOCUSING ON GUATEMALA, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW INSTITUTIONAL MODELS FOR INTERNATIONAL RULE-OF-LAW COMMISSIONS IN POST-CONFLICT STATES WERE TRANSLATED IN A CYCLICAL PROCESS BETWEEN DIFFERENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS. IT OUTLINES TWO MODES OF CYCLES IN THIS PROCESS: (1) NORM APPLICATION AND (2) INTERNATIONAL NORM CHANGE.
593	MEXICO'S CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE REACHING A LIMIT. THE COUNTRY'S TRANSITION FROM AUTHORITARIANISM WAS LARGELY BASED ON A SERIES OF ELECTORAL REFORMS THAT LEVELED THE PLAYING FIELD IN ELECTIONS. WHILE THIS STRATEGY WAS INITIALLY SUCCESSFUL, IT HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ELECTORAL ARENA. THIS ESSAY ANALYZES THE PREVALENCE OF TWO SUCH PROBLEMS, VOTE BUYING AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE, WHICH ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED. I DRAW EVIDENCE FROM AVAILABLE ACCOUNTS OF THE 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND SUBSEQUENT CONTESTS IN PROBLEMATIC STATES SUCH AS TABASCO. THE OUTCOMES OF THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS OF JUNE 2015 ARE ALSO USED TO ASSESS WHETHER PREVIOUS ELECTORAL REFORMS HAVE PROVIDED EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS ANALYZED HERE. I SUGGEST THAT NO LEGAL REFORM WILL BE EFFECTIVE WHILE THESE LAWS ARE ONLY BEING WEAKLY ENFORCED. A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF MEASURES STRENGTHENING THE RULE OF LAW WOULD HELP MEXICO TRANSITION FROM ELECTORAL DEMOCRACY TO LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.
594	THE PROMOTION OF THE "RULE OF LAW" IS A LEADING AMBITION OF THE EU'S EXTERNAL ACTION (ARTICLE 21 TEU). THE DOMINANT APPROACH IN MOST POLICY DOCUMENTS IS TO DEFINE THE RULE OF LAW IN TERMS OF LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHECKLISTS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE CRITICIZED THIS "ANATOMICAL" APPROACH AND HAVE ARGUED FOR A "SOCIOLOGICAL" APPROACH. IN THIS PAPER, I WILL DISCUSS TWO EMPIRICAL MODELS OF THE RULE OF LAW. MOST CURRENT STUDIES FOLLOW THE MODEL OF THE "RULE OF LAW IN ACTION." THIS APPROACH IS BASED ON ROSCOE POUND'S DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE "LAW IN THE BOOKS" AND THE "LAW IN ACTION." I WILL ARGUE THAT THIS CONVENTIONAL APPROACH HAS SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS. I WILL THEREFORE INTRODUCE AN ALTERNATIVE MODEL, BASED ON EUGEN EHRLICH'S CONCEPT OF THE "LIVING LAW." THE PRINCIPAL CONCERN OF THE "LIVING RULE OF LAW" MODEL IS NOT THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL SUPPORT BUT RATHER THE SOCIAL DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW. TO ASSESS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF BOTH APPROACHES, I WILL APPLY BOTH MODELS IN A CASE STUDY ABOUT RULE OF LAW REFORM IN A REFUGEE CAMP ON THE THAILAND-BURMA BORDER. IT WILL BE CONCLUDED THAT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IS ESSENTIAL TO EVALUATE THE EU'S EXTERNAL ACTION. MOREOVER, EMPIRICAL STUDIES BASED ON THE MODEL OF THE LIVING RULE OF LAW SUPPORT A LEGAL PLURALIST APPROACH, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE USER PERSPECTIVE OF CITIZENS AND WHICH RECOGNIZES THE CONTESTED NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW ACROSS CULTURAL BORDERS.
595	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS SURROUNDING THE EU ENERGY POLICY AND ITS ASSOCIATED INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE. PARTICULAR FOCUS IS ON THE AGENCY FOR COOPERATION OF ENERGY REGULATORS (ACER). TAKING STOCK OF ONGOING DEBATES CONCERNING THE ENERGY UNION AND RECENTLY PROPOSED REFORMS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE LIMITS OF THE PRINCIPAL/AGENT MODEL FOR EUROPEAN INTEGRATION AFTER THE TREATY OF LISBON. IT ARGUES THAT A RULE OF LAW ANALYSIS SHOULD SUPPLEMENT THIS MODEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE ENCAPSULATION OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF DELEGATION IN POLICY AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY. SECOND, THIS WILL ENABLE A REFLECTION ON THE PRINCIPLE OF ENERGY JUSTICE AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT IS ARTICULATED BY POLICY AND GOVERNANCE CHANGES IN THE EU.
596	THE CONCEPT OF DEPOLITICISATION IS AN IMPORTANT ANALYTICAL TOOL IN THE STUDY OF BRITISH POLITICS, ALTHOUGH THERE REMAINS A DISPROPORTIONATE FOCUS ON 'SUCCESSFUL' EXAMPLES OF THE STRATEGY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN ACCOUNT OF THE FAILURE OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT, FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT. BY PRESENTING THE ACT AS AN ATTEMPT TO INSULATE GOVERNMENT BY RELYING ON THE 'MAJESTY OF THE LAW' AS A DISCIPLINARY TOOL, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT CONTRADICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW SUPPORTINGCAPITALISTSOCIAL RELATIONS MADE THE COURT AN INAPPROPRIATE VEHICLE FOR GOVERNING AT ARM'S-LENGTH IN THIS CONTEXT. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW THE LINES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BECAME BLURRED, UNDERMINING PERCEPTIONS OF GOVERNMENTAL DISENGAGEMENT. THIS RESULTED IN THE COURT BECOMING THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT OF THE 1970-1974 CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT'S REFORMS. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES HOW THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN FORMAL RULES AND INFORMAL NORMS ASSOCIATED WITH 'DEPOLITICISED INSTITUTIONS' CAN PRODUCE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES AND UNDERMINE A GOVERNING STRATEGY. CONTRARY TO INTENTIONS, THE RULES-BASED STRATEGY EMBODIED IN THE ACT WAS ANYTHING BUT PREDICTABLE AND FUELLED ITS UNTIMELY DEMISE.
597	THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SHOW HOW (NEW) MODES OF GOVERNANCE EMERGE IN EU POLITICS. IT SEEKS TO FIND OUT HOW EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS MANAGE TO DEFINE NEW POLICY TOOLS AND MODES OF GOVERNANCE WHEN THEIR LEGITIMACY IS NOT ONLY CONTESTED BUT IT ALSO REVEALS A REGULATORY GAP. BY EXAMINING RECENT DEBATES CONCERNING THE ABILITY OF THE EU TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW AT THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT IN A FIELD IN WHICH POLITICIZATION RAISES THE PRESSURE TO ACT AT THE EU LEVEL BUT MEMBER STATES DO NOT DELEGATE MORE HIERARCHICAL POWERS, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPLIES A NETWORK APPROACH THAT SPANS BEYOND THE EU. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT, IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE EU'S INPUT, OUTPUT, AND THROUGHPUT LEGITIMACY, THE COMMISSION IS CREATING A COMPLEX MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND HAS INTRODUCED A 'DIVISION OF LABOUR' BETWEEN SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. THE ARTICLE FOCUSES NOT ONLY ON THE EMERGENCE OF THIS NETWORK, BUT ALSO ON ITS EVOLUTION AND EXPANSION.
598	THREE DECADES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESSES, THE WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES HAVE BUILT A DEMOCRATIC FACADE BY HOLDING ELECTIONS, BY PROMULGATING LEGAL ACTS GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, OR BY CONSTITUTIONALLY DECLARING A STRICT SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. IN REALITY, HOWEVER, POLITICAL ELITES RELY ON INFORMAL STRUCTURES, CLIENTELISM, AND CONTROL OF THE MEDIA TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY. GIVEN THAT FORMAL DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS ARE EFFECTIVE ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT POLITICAL ELITES ARE BOUND BY THE EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW, THE CORE ARGUMENT OF THIS STUDY IS THAT THE STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE PURPOSEFULLY EXPLOITED BY DOMESTIC REGIMES, WHICH ARE ABLE TO MISUSE THESE FRAGILE INSTITUTIONS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.
599	THIS STUDY REVISITS THE ACADEMIC DEBATE ON RISING POPULISM AND ILLIBERALISM IN EUROPE THAT REDUCES THE EU'S CRISES TO THOSE INVOLVING 'LIBERAL EU' AND 'ILLIBERAL REGIMES' WITHOUT NECESSARILY DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN THESE REGIMES. APPLYING SUCHMAN'S MULTIDIMENSIONAL ACCOUNT OF LEGITIMACY TO THE EU, IT UNPACKS THE VARYING DOMESTIC CONTESTATIONS OF TWO ILLIBERAL REGIMES AGAINST THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF EU LEGITIMACY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TWO RECENT EU CRISES. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW AN ILLIBERAL INSIDER (HUNGARY) AND AN ILLIBERAL OUTSIDER (TURKEY) CHALLENGE THE EU'S LEGITIMACY IN HANDLING THE RULE OF LAW AND SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISES, RESPECTIVELY, REVEALED TWO FINDINGS. FIRST, HUNGARIAN AND TURKISH ACTORS RAISE DIVERGENT LEGITIMACY CONTESTATIONS AGAINST THE EU'S CRISIS MANAGEMENT IN THE SELECT CASES. SECOND, THEIR POSITIONALITY TOWARDS THE EU DRIVES THIS DIVERGENCE. WHILE BOTH COUNTRIES SEEK TO DELEGITIMISE THE EU, THEIR POINTS OF CONTENTION DIFFER BASED ON BEING IN OR OUTSIDE THE EU.
600	CREATING AN AUTONOMOUS AND EFFICIENT JUDICIARY REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY STEP FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RECONCILIATION OF A NATION DIVIDED BY ALMOST TWO DECADES OF CONFLICT OVER THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF IVOIRITE . THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN COTE D'IVOIRE UNDER THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, ALASSANE OUATTARA, BY COMPARING THE PERIOD OF HIS PRESIDENCY TO THOSE OF HIS PREDECESSORS, HENRI KONAN BEDIE, GENERAL ROBERT GUEI AND LAURENT GBAGBO. I ARGUE THAT THE JUDICIARY IS STILL STRUGGLING TO ESTABLISH ITS AUTONOMY AND THAT ONE OF ITS MAIN PROBLEMS IS ITS LACK OF IMPARTIALITY. I EXAMINE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE COURTS' PERSISTENT WEAK ACCOUNTABILITY PERFORMANCE AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE REMEDIES.
601	HONG KONG HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED FOR ITS WELL-ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW (ROL). AFTER THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT IN 2014, THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME ADJUSTED ITS STRATEGY TOWARDS HONG KONG AND CLOSED THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY. WITH THE END OF THE ERA OF SEMIDEMOCRACY, THE GOVERNING SYSTEM IN HONG KONG IS NOW GOING IN AN AUTHORITARIAN DIRECTION. IN THIS NEW ERA OF SEMI-AUTHORITARIANISM, HONG KONG'S ROL FACES THE MOST SERIOUS CHALLENGES. THE MEANING OF THE ROL IS NOW BEING REDEFINED BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME. HONG KONG IS FIGHTING A BATTLE ON THE DISCOURSE OF THE ROL. THE LEGAL CULTURE OF HONG KONG PEOPLE MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND SUCH AN IDEOLOGICAL ENCROACHMENT. THE LEGAL PROFESSIONALS IN HONG KONG PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DEFENDING MORE ADVANCED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE ROL WHICH IS NOT JUST ABOUT MAINTAINING SOCIAL ORDER AND COMPLIANCE WITH LAW BUT CONCERNS CONSTRAINTS ON ARBITRARY POWERS AND PROTECTION OF THE CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. THERE ARE WORRIES AS WELL AS HOPES. ONE THING IS SURE, THE BATTLE WILL BE LONG AND TOUGH.
602	THIS CONTRIBUTION DISCUSSES THE LINKS BETWEEN MARTIN KRYGIER'S AND PHILIP SELZNICK'S WORK ON THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE WAY KRYGIER EXPLAINS AND RECONSTRUCTS SELZNICK'S THEORY IS HELPFUL, AND YET RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT AND APPLICATION OF THE IDEAL. UNDERSTANDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE INTERRELATION WITH ANOTHER CENTRAL LEGAL IDEAL, JUSTICE, REQUIRES NOT ONLY A REALISTIC ASSESSMENT BUT ALSO A THEORETICAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE IDEALS AT STAKE.
603	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE RESILIENCE OF SOCIETIES FOR GOVERNING COMPLEX SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL CHANGES. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CERTAINTY HAVE CHANGED, AND THAT THEY CAN BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE USE OF FRAMEWORK LAWS OF A RATHER OPEN-TEXTURED CHARACTER, PROVIDED CERTAIN LEGAL SAFEGUARDS, SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO A LEGAL REVIEW, ARE AT HAND. WHILE LEGAL CERTAINTY IS AN IMPORTANT VIRTUE OF LAW, IT DOES NOT AS SUCH NECESSARILY PREVENT ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION-MAKING CONCERNING HEALTH, THE ENVIRONMENT OR THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONSIDERS TO WHAT EXTENT CERTAIN ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE MEANS OF CONTROL IN THE FIELD OF ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES MATCH THE FINDINGS AND PROPOSALS, E.G. ON FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY, PROVIDED BY RESILIENCE RESEARCH. FINALLY THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPACT OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY ON GOVERNANCE OF LARGE-SCALE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL CHANGES, WITH REACH ACROSS STATE BORDERS. IT CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE SOME ATTEMPTS OF SOFTENING THE IMPACT OF STATE BORDERS IN TRANSBOUNDARY ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION-MAKING AND MANAGEMENT, STATE SOVEREIGNTY STILL HAMPERS MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES IN SUCH CONTEXTS.

604	THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT S 75(V) JURISDICTIONAL ERROR SURPASSES THE SOVEREIGNTY OF PARLIAMENT, AS THE AUSTRALIAN FORM OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT OFFERS A DEFINITION OF JURISDICTIONAL ERROR, CONSIDERED HERE AT LENGTH, AND ALSO PROPOUNDS DEFINITIONS OF THE CROWN, CROWN IMMUNITY, AND JUDICIAL POWER. IT ALSO EXPLAINS HOW AUSTRALIAN SOVEREIGNTY IS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW AS FOUNDED BY THE CROWN, WHICH ORIGINALLY SYMBOLISED THE SOVEREIGNTY OF PARLIAMENT. THE SOVEREIGNTY OF PARLIAMENT IS CHARACTERISED AS A FORM OF JURISDICTIONAL ERROR, ALBEIT A DECREPIT ONE BY THE TIME OF THE DISMISSAL OF THE WHITLAM GOVERNMENT IN 1975. SUBSEQUENTLY THE HIGH COURT'S S 75(V) JURISPRUDENCE OVER THE LAST DECADE IS SHOWN TO NOW BE THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF THE RULE OF LAW.
605	AFRICA HAS WITNESSED A PROLIFERATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS COURTS AS WELL AS CRIMINAL COURTS AT DIFFERENT LAYERS OF GOVERNANCE - GLOBALLY OPERATING COURTS, REGIONAL COURTS AS WELL AS SUB-REGIONAL COURTS - WHICH SUGGESTS THAT ANALYZING THIS PHENOMENON THROUGH THE PRISM OF MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNANCE (MLG) WILL YIELD INTERESTING INSIGHTS INTO THE WORKINGS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN AN ERA OF GLOBAL LEGAL PLURALISM. ONE MIGHT BE INCLINED TO CONCLUDE THAT THE MORE COURTS THERE ARE, THE BETTER FOR THE RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE DISPERSION OF JUDICIAL AUTHORITY ACTUALLY HAS A RATHER AMBIVALENT IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE MLG DOES FACILITATE FORUM-SHOPPING, WHETHER OR NOT THE SIMULTANEOUS AVAILABILITY OF DIFFERENT FORA WEAKENS OR STRENGTHENS THE RULE OF LAW DEPENDS ON WHO IS EXPLOITING THIS AVAILABILITY. SECONDLY, LEGITIMACY DEFICITS OF COURTS AT ONE LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE WILL SPUR JUDICIAL INSTITUTION-BUILDING AT OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNANCE. THIRD, MLG ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCES NORM COLLISIONS; HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF AN 'OBJECTIVE' THIRD PARTY MIGHT RESOLVE THESE NORM COLLISIONS. FOURTH, IN ORDER FOR COURTS IN MLG TO FUNCTION AS A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, THEY WILL NEED THE SUPPORT OF COMPLIANCE CONSTITUENCIES WITH RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS PREFERENCES.
606	IS CHINA 'S & QUOT;SOCIALIST RULE BY LAW & QUOT; ((SIC)(SIC)(SIC)(SIC)(SIC)(SIC)) QUALIFIED TO BE CALLED & QUOT;RULE OF LAW & QUOT; ((SIC)(SIC)) OR A & QUOT;THIN RULE OF LAW & QUOT; PROPOSED BY RANDALL PEEREMBOON, WITHOUT ABOLISHING THE POLITICAL SUPREMACY OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY? SINCE THE MID-1990S, THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM AND ITS JUDICIARY HAVE GONE THROUGH REFORMS AND ON THE WHOLE MODERNIZED. HOWEVER, THE CHINESE JUDICIARY STILL FACES MANY PROBLEMS, AND AMONG THEM THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL JURISTS, CORRUPTION AND LOCAL PROTECTIONISM APPEAR AS CRUCIAL ONES. THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND LACK OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION CLEARLY INTENSIFY THESE PROBLEMS. & QUOT;RULE OF LAW & QUOT; ((SIC)(SIC)) OR & QUOT;RULE BY LAW & QUOT; ((SIC)(SIC)) IN CHINA IS STILL MORE OFTEN INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF THE RESPECTIVE POLITICAL, BUREAUCRATIC AND ECONOMIC POWERS OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED THAN ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES OF LAW OR EQUITY. THE MODERNIZATION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE, BUT THE POLITICAL TRANSLATION OF THE LEGAL DEMANDS OF SOCIETY AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL TAKE TIME TO MATERIALIZE. IN THE MEANTIME, RISKS, SETBACKS AND DIFFICULTIES WILL CONTINUE TO PREVENT CHINA FROM ESTABLISHING A TRULY INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY AND WHAT IS UNIVERSALLY CALLED A RULE OF LAW.
607	THE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU OR UNION) AND THIRD COUNTRIES ON THE RETURN AND READMISSION OF IRREGULAR MIGRANTS IS INCREASINGLY INFORMAL, ENSHRINED IN POLITICAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE DEALS RATHER THAN FORMAL INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF THE SYSTEMATISATION IN THE USE OF INFORMAL DEALS ON THE RULE OF LAW COMPLIANCE OF THE UNION'S RETURN POLICY. IT ARGUES THAT THE SYSTEMATIC RECOURSE TO INFORMAL DEALS RELATES TO A STRATEGIC AVOIDANCE OF JUDICIAL AND DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE UNION'S ACTION. MORE PARTICULARLY, EU INSTITUTIONS MAKE USE OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND NON-BINDING INFORMAL DEALS TO SEVER AN AREA OF GOVERNANCE WITH CLEAR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS, I.E. THE EU RETURN POLICY, FROM JUDICIAL AND DEMOCRATIC OVERSIGHT. THIS COMPROMISES THE RULE OF LAW COMPLIANCE OF THE EU RETURN POLICY. IN FACT, AS CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE EU LEGAL ORDER, THE RULE OF LAW INEXTRICABLY CONNECTS AND ENCOMPASSES THE PRE-EMINENCE OF THE LAW, DEMOCRATIC GUARANTEES, AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION.
608	THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA (ICTY) IS AN ADVANCE IN THE RULE OF LAW AND ARGUABLY PART OF A LARGER PROCESS OF THE GLOBALIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC NORMS. YET SUPPORT FOR THE ICTY IS INCREASINGLY INFLUENCED BY LOCAL PROCESSES IN WHICH THESE NORMS ARE CONTESTED BY INDIGENOUS PARTIES AND FORCES. WE EXPLORE THIS ISSUE WITH REGARD TO SUPPORT OF SERBS LIVING IN AND OUTSIDE OF SERBIA FOR THE ICTY IN COMPARISON TO LOCAL COURTS. SERBS IN BELGRADE ARE DISTINCTIVE IN INSISTING THAT WAR CRIMINALS BE TRIED IN THEIR PLACES OF ORIGIN, WHILE SERBS IN SARAJEVO AND VUKOVAR AGREE WITH OTHER GROUPS IN THESE SETTINGS THAT WAR CRIMINALS SHOULD BE TRIED IN THE LOCATIONS WHERE THEIR CRIMES OCCURRED. THIS IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE LOCALIZED INFLUENCE OF CULTURAL NORMS ON ETHNIC AND NATIONAL GROUP MEMBERS IN POST-WAR CRIME SETTINGS.
609	EUROPOL WAS BUILT ON THE BASIS OF SECRECY, ACCORDING TO THE FACT THAT THE POLICE - AND A FORTIORI POLICE COOPERATION - MUST HAVE THE GREATEST DISCRETION IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, EUROPOL HAS DEVELOPED, DRAPED IN THE SECRET DIPLOMACY OF EUROPEAN POLICE COOPERATION BASED ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL LOGIC. SUCH A LOGIC OF SECRECY HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, WHICH HAS STRESSED THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE OFFICE. SUCCESSIVE REFORMS OF THE LAW ESTABLISHING EUROPOL MARK THE REGULAR STRENGTHENING OF THIS TYPE OF CONTROL IN THE NAME OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
610	IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, THE RULE OF LAW HAS UNDERGONE A REVIVAL IN LEGAL, ACADEMIC, BUSINESS, MILITARY, AND DEVELOPMENT SPHERES. YET WE LACK A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISTINCT FORMS THE RULE OF LAW TAKES, AND HOW AND WHY THEY VARY ACROSS STATES AND OVER TIME. THIS STUDY INDICATES ONE WAY TO OPERATIONALIZE RULE OF LAW FOR ANALYTIC PURPOSES WHILE RESPECTING THE NONLINEAR COMBINATIONS OF RULE OF LAW'S MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS. THE RESULTS IMPLY RULE OF LAW IS NOT ALL OF A PIECE AND IS LIKELY TO TAKE ONLY A HANDFUL OF FAIRLY PREDICTABLE FORMS. ANALYZING PROFILES OF RULE OF LAW IN THE 1990S SUGGESTS FIVE MAIN TYPOLOGIES: FULL RULE OF LAW, INCOMPLETE RULE OF LAW, PEACEFUL UNRULE OF LAW, UNSTABLE LAWLESSNESS, AND VIOLENT UNRULE OF LAW. FINALLY, THIS ESSAY ENCOURAGES DEBATES ABOUT THE CONCEPTUALIZATION, MEASUREMENT, AND TYPES OF RULE OF LAW SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN THE LITERATURE ON DEMOCRACY. FINALLY, THIS ESSAY ENCOURAGES DEBATES ABOUT THE CONCEPTUALIZATION, MEASUREMENT, AND TYPES OF RULE OF LAW SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN THE LITERATURE ON DEMOCRACY.
611	FOUNDED ON THE VERY DIFFERENT NATURE OF PRIVATE PERSONS AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC LAW IS ANALYSED AS THE TRUE SUMMA DIVISIO OF THE LAW, REQUIRED BY THE RULE OF LAW OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL STATE. ALL THE LAW SYSTEM IN ITS DEEP UNITY RELAYS ON THE ESSENTIAL EQUAL DIGNITY OF EVERY HUMAN BEING, BUT, WHILE PRIVATE LAW RULES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, LEGALLY FREE AND EQUAL, AND CORPORATIONS FREELY CREATED BY THEM, PUBLIC LAW SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH THE ORGANISATION AND ACTION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES UNDER EXIGENCIES SUBJECTION AND SERVICE WHICH SHAPE ALL THEIR STATUS AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH THE PRIVATE PERSONS, EVEN BEYOND THEIR NECESSARY PUBLIC POWERS.
612	COMMISSION'S EXPECTATIONS ON EVENTUAL COMPLIANCE EXPLAIN ITS DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR WHEN DEALING WITH RULE OF LAW (ROL) CRISES IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. WHILST THE COMMISSION ACTIVATED THE FIRST STAGE OF THE PROCEDURE OF ARTICLE 7 AGAINST POLAND IN DECEMBER 2017, IT RESISTED TO LAUNCH THE SAME PROCEDURE AGAINST THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT DESPITE MOUNTING CRITICISM AND DEMANDS FROM BOTH ACADEMICS AND EU INSTITUTIONS. THE COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT COMPLIANCE DEPENDS, ON LAST INSTANCE, ON THE COOPERATION OF DOMESTIC AUTHORITIES. ACCORDINGLY, IT PREFERS TO ENGAGE WITH THEM IN DIALOGUE AND PERSUASION RATHER THAN ACTIVATING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. IF ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES FAIL TO OBTAIN COMPLIANCE, THE COMMISSION ANTICIPATES THE CONSEQUENCE OF ACTIVATING ARTICLE 7 ENFORCEMENT: WHETHER IT CAN RELY OR NOT ON COUNCIL SUPPORT AND THE EFFECTS OF NOT HAVING IT AND IT ALSO ANTICIPATES NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS THE FUTURE ATTITUDE OF THE AFFECTED MEMBER STATE VIS-A-VIS THE EU.
613	THE RULE OF LAW (ROL), AS A HIGHLY VALUED INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLE AND ONE OF THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ITS ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. OVERLAPPING INTERESTS BETWEEN CHINA'S SEARCH FOR EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS AND THE EU'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE EXPERIENCE PROVIDE A SOLID GROUND FOR BILATERAL COOPERATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL AREA, AND THE ROL WHICH IS EMBODIED IN THESE BILATERAL PROGRAMMES HAS ALSO BEEN DIFFUSED TO CHINA. THROUGH LOOKING AT THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH OF CAPACITY BUILDING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE BOTTOM-UP APPROACH OF THE RAISING OF PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROMOTION, CHINA'S LESSON-DRAWING AND THE EU'S ROL PROMOTION IN EU-CHINA ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE PROGRAMME CAN BE UNDERSTOOD. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH STUDYING THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF ROL PROMOTION REQUIRES MORE EMPIRICAL DATA, THIS PAPER DOES EXPLAIN HOW EU NORMS DIFFUSE IN PRACTICE.
614	ON A POPULAR UNDERSTANDING, THE RULE OF LAW IS VALUABLE BECAUSE IT ENABLES PEOPLE TO PLAN THEIR LIVES. HOWEVER, PLANNING CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE UNDERMINED BY THE SHEER QUANTITY OF LEGAL RULES, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES CHARACTERISTIC OF MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE STATES. UNDER CONDITIONS OF HYPERLEXIS, PEOPLE CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO RELIABLY USE THE LAW AS A GUIDE TO CONDUCT. RATHER THAN CONCLUDE THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS INIMICAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, HOWEVER, I DEFEND AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. ON WHAT I TERM A CONTESTATORY CONCEPTION, THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE DECISIONS MADE BY OFFICIALS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR LEGAL POWERS. THE ANIMATING IDEA OF A CONTESTATORY CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF THE LAW IS THAT OFFICIALS SHOULD RELATE TO CITIZENS IN THE SPACE OF REASONS RATHER THAN MERELY THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF POWER.
615	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WHEN IT ADOPTS OUTCOME DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS RESOLUTIONS, PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENTS AND PRESS STATEMENTS. IT IS COMMONLY ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR VETO POWER AND PERMANENCY CHINA, FRANCE, RUSSIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE GREATER INFLUENCE THAN THEIR ELECTED COUNTERPARTS IN SHAPING THOSE OUTCOMES. IN RECENT YEARS, THAT CONTROL HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THE PENHOLDERSHIP SYSTEM. UNDER THIS PRACTICE, ONE OR MORE MEMBERS, USUALLY FRANCE, THE UNITED STATES OR THE UNITED KINGDOM (P3), TAKE LEADERSHIP OVER A SITUATION ON THE AGENDA OF THE COUNCIL. WHEN 'HOLDING THE PEN' A MEMBER OFTEN DECIDES WHAT ACTION THE COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE, THEN DRAFTS AN OUTCOME DOCUMENT THAT IT NEGOTIATES WITH OTHER PERMANENT MEMBERS BEFORE SHARING THE TEXT WITH ELECTED MEMBERS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PRACTICE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL'S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. IT ARGUES THAT, WHILE CONCENTRATING POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE P3, HENCE DIMINISHING TRANSPARENCY AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION-MAKING OF THE COUNCIL, AT THE SAME TIME THE PENHOLDERSHIP SYSTEM ALSO PROVIDES AN AVENUE TO STRENGTHEN ELECTED MEMBERS' INFLUENCE IN WAYS THAT PROMOTE RESPECT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW.
616	THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN THE LODESTAR GUIDING THE DEVELOPMENT ON THE CASE-LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE NORMATIVE IMPACT OF THIS PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN INCREASING IN THE CASE-LAW OF THE COURT, IN PARTICULAR IN CASES DEALING WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTUAL CORE OF THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE CONVENTION SYSTEM AS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF "EUROPEAN PUBLIC ORDER". SUBSEQUENTLY, THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL NORMATIVE STATUS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS EXPLORED AS WELL AS THE COURT'S STATEMENT THAT THE PRINCIPLE IS "INHERENT IN ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE CONVENTION". ON THIS BASIS, AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS IS UNDERTAKEN OF THE APPLICATION IN RECENT STRASBOURG CASE-LAW OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AS A FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIC COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. FINALLY. THE AUTHOR REFLECTS ON THE "SYMBIOTIC" RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIELD OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE STRASBOURG AND THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.
617	SINCE 2012, JUDGES AND PROSECUTORS IN BENIN HAVE REPEATEDLY PROTESTED AGAINST POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AND DEMANDED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR STATUTORILY GUARANTEED INDEPENDENCE. IN 2014 AND 2017, MAGISTRATES DEMONSTRATED IN THEIR JUDICIAL ROBES IN THE STREETS, PROTESTING AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT'S BILL TO DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR RIGHT TO STRIKE AND OTHER FREEDOMS. BENIN HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A 'SUCCESS STORY OF DEMOCRACY' (STROH AND NEVER, 2006, P. 1) AND EVEN AS A 'MODEL DEMOCRACY' (CF. KOHNERT, 1996, P. 78; MAGNUSSON, 2001, P. 211; BIERSCHENK, 2009) SINCE ITS PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS AND ITS PARTICIPATION IN A NATIONAL CONFERENCE IN 1990/91. SO WHY WERE MAGISTRATES IN BENIN DEMONSTRATING IN THE STREETS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR PROFESSION? BASED ON FIELDWORK IN BENIN IN 2009 AND 2015 AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH IN 2017 IN FRANCE, MY PAPER ANALYSES THE CHANGE IN THE STYLE OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARTS OF THE EXECUTIVE AND PARTS OF THE JUDICIARY IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROFESSION - A CHANGE FROM POLITICAL NEGOTIATION TO CONFRONTATION. THROUGH THEIR STRIKES AND INDUSTRIAL ACTION, MAGISTRATES FOUGHT FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE; YET, AT THE SAME TIME THEY CONSTRUCTED LEGALITY AND STRENGTHENED DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THEIR ACTIONS EMPHASISED THE RULE OF LAW. MY PAPER ALSO CONSIDERS THE SPECIFICS OF THEIR STRIKES IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER STRIKING CIVIL SERVANTS. WHEN MAGISTRATES, AS BUREAUCRATS, BECOME POLITICALLY ACTIVE, IT MARKS A TRANSFORMATION IN THEIR SELF-CONCEPTION, AS THEY ARE USUALLY RESERVED AND WITHDRAW THEMSELVES FROM POLITICAL AND PUBLIC SPHERES.
618	THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND DOMESTIC "CHANGE AGENTS" HAVE PROMOTED THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-SOVIET EUROPE WITH VARYING RESULTS. WHILE THE BALTIC STATES (ESTONIA, LATVIA, LITHUANIA) SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW, EASTERN PARTNERSHIP (EAP) COUNTRIES (UKRAINE, MOLDOVA, GEORGIA, AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA) DID NOT. WHY DID EU-DRIVEN LEGAL, JUDICIAL AND ANTI-CORRUPTION REFORMS NOT PRODUCE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LATTER GROUP? I ARGUE THAT DIVIDED ELITES (REFORMERS) IN LAGGARD EAP COUNTRIES ENGAGE IN DETRIMENTAL POLITICAL COMPETITION THAT CREATES INCENTIVES TO MISUSE THE LAW, THE PROSECUTION AND JUDICIAL STRUCTURES AS "POLITICAL WEAPONS". THE RESULT OF THIS POWER STRUGGLE IS AN ERRATIC REFORM PROCESS WHICH PRODUCES REFORM PATHOLOGIES OF EUROPEANIZATION (E.G. LEGAL INSTABILITY AND INCOHERENCE, REINFORCED FRAGMENTATION AND POLITICIZATION) THAT UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. INSTEAD OF SERVING AS AN EXTERNAL CHECK ON RULE-OF-LAW ABUSING REFORMERS, THE EU EMPOWERS REFORMIST BUT UNACCOUNTABLE "CHANGE AGENTS" IN A PARTISAN WAY, THUS CREATING INCENTIVES FOR THE ACCUMULATION AND ABUSE OF POWER, ESPECIALLY AFTER REGIME CHANGES. REFORMERS IN THE ADVANCED BALTIC STATES HAVE AVOIDED DETRIMENTAL POLITICAL COMPETITION, THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE STATE AND MANY REFORM PITFALLS THROUGH DE FACTO EXCLUSION OF ETHNIC RUSSIANS FROM THE POLITICAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THIS POLICY OF PARTIAL EXCLUSION ALLOWED ELITES IN ESTONIA AND LATVIA TO BUILD CONSENSUS, TO CREATE A UNITARY STATE, INCLUDING STRONG, UNIFIED AND INDEPENDENT HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES (E.G. JUDICIARY, OMBUDSMAN, CONSTITUTIONAL COURT ETC.) WHICH IN TURN WERE ABLE TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE. THE ARGUMENT IS SUPPORTED BY AN EMPIRICAL, INDICATOR-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SEVERAL INTERVIEWS WITH REPRESENTATIVES IN BRUSSELS, STRASBOURG AND CHISINAU.
619	THIS PAPER OFFERS A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMON LAW OF PROPERTY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE STANDARD WAY OF FRAMING THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHIN THE TERMS OF THE FORM/SUBSTANCE DEBATE WITHIN THE LITERATURE ON THE RULE OF LAW: DOES THE RULE OF LAW INCLUDE ONLY FORMAL AND PROCEDURAL ASPECTS OR DOES IT ALSO ENCOMPASS AND SUPPORT SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS SUCH AS PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES? BY FOCUSING ON THE NATURE OF COMMON-LAW REASONING, I WISH TO QUESTION THE FORM/SUBSTANCE DICHOTOMY THAT FRAMES THIS DEBATE AND TO SHOW THAT THE FORMAL ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE IN FACT PRINCIPLES WIDELY ADOPTED WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF COMMON-LAW REASONING AND AS SUCH PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN SHAPING THE SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT OF COMMON-LAW PROPERTY RIGHTS. UNDERSTANDING THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS BEYOND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROPERTY LAW AND THE RULE OF LAW.
620	THIS PAPER AIMS TO DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE CONCEPT OF DIVISION OF POWERS SINCE IT WAS CONCEIVED IN THE WORK OF MONTESQUIEU TO ITS CENTRAL PILLARS IN THE NEW PARADIGM OF DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL RULE OF LAW. IN THIS CONTEXT, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEW PARADIGM ASSIGNS A DUAL PURPOSE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS AND TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AS AN INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF PUBLIC LAW, BECAUSE ON ONE HAND IT HAS TO TEND TO THE ORGANIZATION, DISCIPLINE AND MODULATION OF POWER, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IT MUST BE FLEXIBLE, DYNAMIC AND FUNCTIONAL SO THAT IT CAN BECOME EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT IN REGULATING THE STATE ACTION (USING INESCAPABLY PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES UNIVERSALLY STANDARDIZED). THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE CURRENT OBJECTIVE OF THE DIVISION OF POWERS IS TO GUARANTEE THE DEFENSE AND PROTECTION OF FREEDOMS AND THE REALIZATION OF THE RIGHTS IN A FRAMEWORK OF FLEXIBILITY.
621	AIMING TO FOSTER REFLECTION ON THE ROLE OF THE EU REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ESSAY REVISITS, IN A NORMATIVE FASHION, THE UNION'S LEGAL SYSTEM WITH REFERENCES TO RECENT AND ESTABLISHED CASE LAW AND LITERATURE. IT UNDERSTANDS THE JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A SYNONYM OF EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION AND ANALYSES THE PLURALISTIC SYSTEM OF THE UNION AS BEING OVERARCHED BY LOYALTY. IT THEN INTRODUCES THREE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW RELATED TO ITS JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT. THE FIRST CONCERNS ITS MATERIAL ASPECT: THE STANDARDS OF PROTECTION OF RIGHTS AND PRINCIPLES. THE CONTRIBUTION OPINES THAT THE SYSTEMIC ANALYSIS OF THE UNION EXCLUDES CONFLICTS OF STANDARDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT REFERS TO JUDICIAL CONTROL. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE RELATED STRUCTURAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE MEMBER STATES ARE ENFORCEABLE BY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS GROUNDED ON A SELF-STANDING RIGHT. THE LAST COMPONENT IS ORGANIC AND RELATES TO THE JUDGE. THE CONTRIBUTION POSITS THAT THE NATIONAL JUDGE IS EMPOWERED BY HER EUROPEAN MANDATE TO ENFORCING THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE TECHNIQUE OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AS PART OF THE MECHANISM OF THE EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANT CONFIRMS THIS POSITION, CASES OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS SUGGEST THE PROCEDURAL DEFICIENCY.
622	THE PROJECT OF SQUARING THE RULE OF LAW WITH EXECUTIVE GOVERNANCE IS COMING TO A HEAD. HARDLY A WEEK PASSES WITHOUT COMMENTATORS SUMMONING THE RULE OF LAW TO PASS JUDGMENT ON THE LEGITIMACY OR DESIRABILITY OF SOME EXECUTIVE ACTION. BUT THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW, THE FURTHER IT SEEMS TO SLIP AWAY. RATHER THAN LOOK TO THE RULE OF LAW FOR ANSWERS, THIS ARTICLE SHINES CRITICAL LIGHT ON WHAT THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL CANNOT TELL US. MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS WHY EVEN WELL-INTENDED EFFORTS TO SQUARE THE RULE OF LAW WITH TRENDS IN EXECUTIVE GOVERNANCE CAN BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. TO ANCHOR THESE POINTS, THE ARTICLE PRESENTS COMPARATIVE CASE STUDIES OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIGNATURE IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND THE RULE OF LAW DEBATES SURROUNDING THEM. THE OBAMA-TRUMP JUXTAPOSITION OFFERS A PORTRAIT OF SOME DISQUIETING TRENDS, NOT ONLY FOR PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION, BUT ALSO IN HOW WE THINK AND TALK ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL. THIS ARTICLE INTERVENES WITH SOME PRESCRIPTIONS MOVING FORWARD-INCLUDING AWAY FROM RULE OF LAW TALK, AND TOWARDS DOCTRINES AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY CHECK PRESIDENTIAL POWER.
623	THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A COMMUNITY OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW IS A EUROPEAN VALUE ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE 2 OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION. ITS EFFECTIVENESS REQUIRES THE EXISTENCE OF AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIAL POWER IN THE UNION ITSELF AND IN EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MEMBER STATES. TODAY IT IS THREATENED BY AN INTERNAL ENEMY: ILLIBERAL POPULISM THAT CHALLENGES THE COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN INSTITUTIONS OF CONTROL OF POWER. IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER I WILL SHOW THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF ILLIBERAL POPULISM WITH THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL CULTURE THAT GIVES MEANING TO COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN INSTITUTIONS. INCOMPATIBILITY THAT DIRECTLY LEADS HIM TO CHALLENGE A BASIC PRINCIPLE INHERENT TO THAT, SUCH AS RESPECT FOR JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. IN THE SECOND, I WILL ANALYZE THE RESPONSE GIVEN BY THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND SPECIFICALLY, THE COURT OF JUSTICE, TO THE ATTACKS ON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BY THE POLISH STATE.
624	IN RECENT YEARS AN INCREASING QUANTITY OF UK LEGISLATION HAS INTRODUCED BLENDED OR 'HYBRIDISED' PROCEDURES THAT BLUR THE PREVIOUSLY CLEAR DEMARCATION BETWEEN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LEGAL PROCESSES, TYPICALLY ON THE GROUNDS OF NORMATIVELY-MOTIVATED POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE ON INSTANCES OF PROCEDURAL HYBRIDISATION IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THAT, FIRST, THE RELIANCE UPON CIVIL LAW MEASURES TO REMEDY CRIMINAL LAW INFRACTIONS CAN RAISE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES AND, SECOND, THAT SUCH INSTRUMENTAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE STRATEGIES DELIBERATELY CIRCUMVENT THE ENHANCED PROCEDURAL PROTECTIONS OF THE CRIMINAL LAW. BY CONCEPTUALISING THE RULE OF LAW AS A STRUCTURAL COUPLING BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS, AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AS NECESSARY AND SELF-IMPOSED LIMITATIONS UPON SYSTEMIC OPERATIONS, THIS PAPER EMPLOYS A SYSTEMS-THEORETICAL APPROACH TO CRITIQUE THIS BALANCING ACT BETWEEN EXPEDIENCY AND PRINCIPLE, AND QUERIES THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH LEGISLATION CONTRAVENING THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE SAID TO LACK LEGITIMACY.
625	THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO ANALYZE THE RULE OF LAW IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS OF THE JUDICIARY, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AS A DIRECTION TO ENSURE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE IN UKRAINE, REVEALING ITS RELATIONSHIP AND INTERDEPENDENCE. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES IS PROVIDED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF ALL THESE GENERIC SUBSYSTEMS OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT DETERMINE MODERN STANDARDS OF ACTIVITY IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND GENERALIZATION OF THE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC AND THEORETICAL MATERIAL, AS WELL AS THE FORMULATION OF RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS. DURING THE RESEARCH, SCIENTIFIC COGNITION METHODS WERE USED: TERMINOLOGICAL, LOGICAL-SEMANTIC, FUNCTIONAL, SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL, LOGICAL-NORMATIVE, COMPARATIVE. THEY HIGHLIGHT IN THE CONCLUSIONS THAT THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF UKRAINE IN THE CONTEXT OF JUDICIAL REFORM MADE IT POSSIBLE TO REVISE THE CLASSICAL PRINCIPLES OF THE JUDICIARY, BUT THERE ARE STILL IMPORTANT UNRESOLVED ASPECTS TO ENSURE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, ITS SPECIFICATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTS OF UKRAINE OF SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL CONTENT, AMONG OTHER ASPECTS.
626	AS CONSTANTLY REPEATED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE, THE EUROPEAN UNION IS A UNION BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH MEANS, AMONG OTHERS, THAT ALL ACTS OF ITS INSTITUTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW OF THEIR COMPATIBILITY WITH THE 'HIGHER LAW', IN PARTICULAR THE TREATIES, GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. IN OTHER WORDS, NO ACT OF AN EU INSTITUTION CAN ESCAPE THE JUDICIAL REVIEW PERFORMED BY THE COURT OF JUSTICE. HOWEVER, A QUESTION ARISES WHETHER THIS RULE APPLIES OR SHOULD APPLY EVEN TO EU ACTS HAVING A CHARACTER OF SOFT LAW. ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT HAVE BINDING LEGAL FORCE OR DO NOT INDUCE BINDING LEGAL EFFECTS, THEY ARE STILL RESULTS OF THE EXERCISE OF PUBLIC POWERS, AND HENCE THEY SHOULD BE UNDER THE JUDICIAL CONTROL AS WELL. NONETHELESS, THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW SEEMS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE SUCH A CONTROL. THE ACTION FOR ANNULMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE, AND THE PRELIMINARY REFERENCE ON VALIDITY, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SOFT LAW, PRESENTS AN IMPERFECT ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE OF VARIOUS OBSTACLES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, IN THE NAME OF THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS DESIRABLE TO CHANGE THE CURRENT SETTINGS AND TO ALLOW FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SOFT LAW IN ALL POSSIBLE PROCEDURAL CHANNELS.
627	MODERN WESTERN SOCIETIES HAVE WITNESSED A MASSIVE GROWTH OF LEGISLATION AND OTHER LEGAL ACTS. THIS STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT MODERN LIFE IN GENERAL IS INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND DEVELOPS VERY FAST, WHICH IS REASONABLY REFLECTED IN MORE FREQUENT LEGAL CHANGES THAN WERE COMMON BEFORE. BUT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS IT SEEMS THAT THE DYNAMIC CONTENT OF LAW MIGHT BE EXAGGERATED RESULTING IN UNREASONABLY FREQUENT CHANGES. THIS IS TYPICAL OF THE (PRESENT) SITUATION IN SLOVENIA AS A TRANSITIONAL COUNTRY, IN WHICH LEGAL CERTAINTY INCLUDING LEGAL PREDICTABILITY AS TWO IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT JEOPARDISED. CONSEQUENTLY, NOW MORE THAN EVEN WE HAVE BECOME AWARE OF THE NEED TO PUT MORE ATTENTION TO STATIC COMPONENTS IN LAW. THESE HAVE EVER BEEN PART OF LAW, SO MY CLAIM IN THIS ARTICLE IS THAT IT SHOULD BE RE-EMPHASIZED TO A NECESSARY EXTENT IN ORDER TO COUNTERBALANCE UNREASONABLY FREQUENT CHANGES IN OUR LAW. A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE OF A VERY INSTABLE LEGAL DISCIPLINE IN SLOVENIA IS CORPORATE LAW. THUS, THE APPLICATION OF THE STABILITIS-LEGIS PRINCIPLE TO THIS PROBLEM BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, ALSO IN THE AREA OF CORPORATE LAW, COULD POTENTIALLY BE ONE OF THE REMEDIES TO DEAL WITH IT.
628	PAKISTAN, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS 'THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE ON EARTH', IS NOT TYPICALLY THOUGHT OF AS A PLACE WHERE POPULAR NONVIOLENT RESISTANCE COULD TAKE ROOT, MUCH LESS SUCCEED. CITIZEN APATHY, POOR GOVERNANCE, AND FEAR OF REGIME REPRESSION AND TERRORIST VIOLENCE ARE BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE CIVIC ACTIVISM INSIDE PAKISTAN. YET, OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, PAKISTAN'S AUTHORITARIAN RULER WAS OUSTED AND ITS INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY RESTORED FOLLOWING A MASSIVE GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN LED BY LAWYERS. THE 'MEN IN BLACK', WHOSE INSISTENCE ON THE RULE OF LAW AND EMBRACE OF NONVIOLENT STRUGGLE CAPTURED THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF MILLIONS OF PAKISTANIS, HELPED TRANSFORM THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. THE SUCCESSES TALLIED BY THIS NONVIOLENT MOVEMENT, THIS ARTICLE WILL ARGUE, CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LARGE-SCALE NON-COOPERATION AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THAT PRESSURED TWO SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI REGIMES - ONE AUTHORITARIAN AND ONE DEMOCRATIC - TO YIELD TO ITS DEMANDS. UNITY AND MASS PARTICIPATION, NONVIOLENT DISCIPLINE, AND THE CREATIVE USE OF NONVIOLENT TACTICS WERE THREE KEY INGREDIENTS OF SUCCESS. WHILE INSTABILITY AND ISLAMIST EXTREMISM CONTINUE TO PLAGUE PAKISTAN, THE LAWYERS' MOVEMENT HIGHLIGHTS THE STEADILY GROWING STRENGTH OF PAKISTANI CIVIL SOCIETY HAVE A POTENTIAL TO INFLUENCE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY.
629	NEW, ALTERNATIVE, FORMS OF CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION, IN PARTICULAR PROCESSES OF INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL LAWMAKING ('IN-LAW'), HARE EMERGED AND GAINED PROMINENCE SINCE THE 2000S IN RESPONSE TO AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE, NETWORKED, AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOCIETY. THIS TRANSFORMATION IMPACTS ON TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW AS WELL AS ON THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF AN EMERGING INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. THIS IS ALL THE MORE THE CASE GIVEN THE TENDENCY TO EMPHASISE THE FORMAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LATTER. THE PRESENT ARTICLE, NEVERTHELESS, CHALLENGES THE ASSUMPTION THAT INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL LAW IS, BECAUSE OF ITS INFORMAL NATURE, BY DEFINITION INCOMPATIBLE WITH A RULE OF LAW APPROACH. THE ARTICLE THERETO REINTRODUCES A NEGATIVE (SHIELDING SOCIETY FROM ARBITRARINESS) AND A POSITIVE (PROVIDING REQUIREMENTS FOR LAWMAKING) CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. FIRST, IT IDENTIFIES ACTORS AND PROCESSES OF INFORMAL INTERNATIONAL LAWMAKING AND ELUCIDATES THE EXTENT OF THEIR RELIANCE ON LEGAL PRINCIPLES AS OPPOSED TO THE WIELDING OF ARBITRARY POWER ON THE INTERNATIONAL PLANE. SECOND, IT OPERATIONALISES A RULE OF LAW APPROACH IN THE THREE PHASES OF INFORMAL LAWMAKING PROCESSES (LAWMAKING PER SE, LAW-APPLICATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY). AS SUCH, IT DISCUSSES HOW A NUMBER OF CONCRETE RULE OF LAW REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO PARTICIPATION, PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES, ACCESSIBILITY OF NORMS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS ARE IMPLEMENTED. TO CONCLUDE, IT IS SUBMITTED THAT RULE OF LAW THEORIES CAN BE RECONCILED WITH IN-LAW, WITHOUT AFFECTING THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE NON-TRADITIONAL NORMS PRODUCED AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL.
630	AFRICA AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD HAVE BEEN THE THEATRE OF COUNTLESS RULES OF LAW ASSISTANCE PROJECTS SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II, WITH MIXED RESULTS. WHILE THE REASONS FOR THE MIXED RESULTS VARY FROM PROJECT TO PROJECT AND FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS THAT ARISE RIGHT FROM PROJECT INCEPTION, REVIEWS THE CYCLE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT FROM PROBLEM CONSTRUCTION TO MONITORING AND EVALUATION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CORE AND SECONDARY ASPECTS OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT SUCH AS SCOPE, BUDGET, QUALITY, SCHEDULE, AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, COMMUNICATION, RISK MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT. WITH A FOCUS ON THE ATTAINMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF AGENDA 2030, THE PAPER ADDRESSES THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS: IDENTIFY CHALLENGES OF PAST APPROACHES OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS AND INTERROGATE THE CURRENT SHIFT IN PARADIGM BY THE WORLD BANK, UNITED NATIONS AND THE UNITED KINGDOM'S DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (DFLD). IT WILL CONSIDER LESSONS FROM COMPLEXITY AND OTHER METHODOLOGIES, THEORIES OF CHANGE, THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS, AND THE PROBLEM DRIVEN ITERATIVE ADAPTATION (PDIA) MODEL AS TOOLS FOR DOING DEVELOPMENT DIFFERENTLY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMES, INCLUDING A BETTER APPROACH TO PROJECT DESIGN THAT MAKES ALLOWANCE FOR RESULTS BASED PROGRAMMING, EASE OF ADAPTATION, REFLECTIVE LEARNING THROUGH AFTER ACTION REVIEWS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM MILITARY SCIENCE'S DOCTRINES AND PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPLEX OPERATIONS. THE PAPER ALSO RECOMMENDS, BACK AND FORTH ITERATION AND BETTER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, INCLUDING AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE (LOCAL CONTEXTUALIZATION), TO INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS OF RULE OF LAW AND CHANGE IN MIND-SETS ESPECIALLY DONOR AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNER IDEOLOGY.
631	MARTIN KRYGIER'S WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW REDIRECTS OUR ATTENTION FROM ANALYTICAL DEFINITIONS AND CHECKLISTS OF DESIDERATA TO THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT ON THE GROUND. IN DOING SO, HE HAS TAKEN REAL WORLD EXAMPLES - PARTICULARLY FROM EASTERN EUROPE -- AS HIS TOUCHSTONE. HIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW IS RIGOROUS ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL BUT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW US TO ASSESS NEW CASES,INCLUDING WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY IN HUNGARY AND POLAND.
632	THE PAPER CLAIMS THAT DURING THE FIGHT OVER THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CORE VALUES OF THE EU PRONOUNCED IN ARTICLE 2 TEU WITH BACKSLIDING MEMBER STATES THE EU INSTITUTIONS USING BOTH THE TRADITIONAL MECHANISM (INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ARTICLE 7), AND THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK HAVE PROVEN INCAPABLE OF ENFORCING COMPLIANCE, WHICH CONSIDERABLY UNDERMINED NOT ONLY THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COMMISSION, BUT ALSO THAT OF THE ENTIRE RULE OF LAW OVERSIGHT. HENCE, NEW MEANS OF VALUE CONDITIONALITY SHOULD ALSO BE ACTIVATED, SUCH AS CUTTING FUNDS FOR MEMBER STATES THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH CERTAIN BASIC INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. AS THE PAPER ARGUES, THIS IS POSSIBLE THROUGH IMPLEMENTING THE COMMON PROVISION REGULATION, AND CAN BE CARRIED OUT ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. PUTTING CONDITIONALITY INTO THE MULTIANNUAL FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK AFTER THE 2020 BUDGET PERIOD IS ANOTHER POTENTIAL AVENUE TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH JOINT VALUES.
633	THE SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE KEY FEATURES OF THE POST-APARTHEID LEGAL ORDER IN SOUTH AFRICA. FOR EITHER TO HAVE ANY REAL VALUE, HOWEVER, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THEY ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED BY AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY THAT IS FREE FROM EXECUTIVE INFLUENCE. THIS IMPORTANT TASK HAS FALLEN MAINLY ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN CALLED UPON TO RULE ON THE LAWFULNESS OF THE CONDUCT OF BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND HELD THAT BOTH HAD ACTED UNLAWFULLY AND INCONSISTENTLY WITH THE CONSTITUTION. IN THE AUTHOR'S VIEW, THIS RULING SIGNIFIES THAT THE MATURING COURT IS FULLY AWARE OF ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND THAT, UNLIKE ITS APARTHEID ERA PREDECESSORS THAT WERE HAMSTRUNG BY THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT, IT POSSESSES A MANDATE TO CHECK THE ABUSE OF POWER BY OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
634	THE IVERMECTIN SAGA HAS TAKEN ON A NEW DIMENSION: RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW BY THE STATE. THE RULE OF LAW IS IMPORTANT, AS IT IS A CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THE SOUTH AFRICAN HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATORY AUTHORITY (SAHPRA) HAS A STATUTORY MANDATE TO REGULATE MEDICINES AND RELATED SUBSTANCES, BUT IT ALSO HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO OBEY THE LAW. THIS DUTY INCLUDES OBEYING COURT ORDERS. HOWEVER, SAHPRA APPEARS TO HAVE CONTRAVENED THE CONSENT ORDER HANDED DOWN BY THE PRETORIA HIGH COURT ON 2 FEBRUARY 2021, AND THEREFORE UNDERMINED THE RULE OF LAW. THIS SITUATION IS UNTENABLE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER.
635	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE NORMATIVE CONSTRUCTION, NAMELY THE PROCESS OF CREATING RULES OF LAW. THE AUTHOR IDENTIFIES TWO MAIN STAGES OF BUILDING A RULE: FORMATION OF ITS CONTENT AND FORMALIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED MODEL INTO THE FIXED FORM OF LAW. ALL STAGES ARE FURTHER SUB-DIVIDED AND ARE CHARACTERIZED SEPARATELY. THE ARTICLE ALSO FOCUSES ON THE PROBLEMS OF INTER-ELEMENT CONNECTIONS OF A RULE, DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN A RULE AND A NORMATIVE LEGAL INSTRUCTION, DISTORTION OF AN IDEAL RULE AND ITS TRANSFORMATION INTO A REAL ONE.
636	THE UN IS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN EFFORTS TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT AND POSTCONFLICT SETTINGS. YET DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR PEACE, GOOD GOVERNANCE, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF THESE EFFORTS IS SCANT. I DEVELOP A THEORY TO EXPLAIN WHEN UN RULE-OF-LAW REFORM IS LIKELY TO SUCCEED, THEN TEST THE THEORY USING ORIGINAL DATASETS CAPTURING THE NUMBER OF CIVILIAN PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO EACH UN MISSION IN AFRICA, THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL ASSIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO RULE-OF-LAW-RELATED TASKS, AND THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF ACTUAL RULE-OF-LAW-RELATED ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN UN PRESENCE AND THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK WHILE CONFLICT IS ONGOING, BUT ROBUSTLY POSITIVE DURING PERIODS OF PEACE. THE RELATIONSHIP IS STRONGER FOR CIVILIAN THAN UNIFORMED PERSONNEL, AND IS STRONGEST WHEN UN MISSIONS ENGAGE HOST STATES IN THE PROCESS OF REFORM.
637	THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE COVID-19 LEGAL MEASURES AND MODEL OF GOVERNANCE ADOPTED IN THE WESTERN BALKANS COUNTRIES (ALBANIA, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, NORTH MACEDONIA, MONTENEGRO, SERBIA AND KOSOVO) AND ITS IMPACT ON THE STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND ABILITY OF PARLIAMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY TO SCRUTINISE GOVERNMENT DECISIONS. THE ARTICLE ASSESSES THE GOVERNMENTS' APPROACHES TO INTRODUCING AND ENFORCING COVID-19 LEGAL MEASURES, AND SHOWS EXAMPLES OF HOW C OWD-19 HAS EXPOSED MORE OPENLY THE WEAKNESSES IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. THE ARTICLE OFFERS NEW INSIGHTS INTO HOW COVID-19 PRESENTED A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR LEADERS IN THE WESTERN BALKANS TO IMPLEMENT FURTHER THEIR AUTHORITARIAN MODEL OF GOVERNANCE IN UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE OFFERS SUGGESTIONS ON HOW THE EU COULD RESPOND, THROUGH ITS ACCESSION CONDITIONALITY INSTRUMENTS AND CIVIL SOCIETY, TO REDIRECT THIS TREND TOWARDS MORE STATE CAPTURE.
638	THE INTRICACIES REVOLVING AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE IS THE PRIME ISSUE OF THIS CENTURY. FOR THIS, RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS HAVE ALWAYS STRIVED FOR VIABLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NOT JUST EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ARE ALSO INNOVATIVE IN NATURE, SO THAT THEY HAVE THE LEAST POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS TO THE ECOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE RELEVANCY OF THE RULE OF LAW AND GREEN INNOVATION, WHILE ALSO ASCERTAINING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AMONG THE TOP ASIAN COUNTRIES FROM 1995 TO 2018. MOREOVER, THE RELEVANCY OF THE ENVIRONMENT KUZNETS CURVE (EKC) IS ALSO VALIDATED BY THE HELP OF THE ADVANCED AND LATEST ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES; SPECIFICALLY, THE CROSS-SECTION AUGMENTED AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAGS TEST (CS-ARDL). BASED ON THE FINDINGS FROM THE CS-ARDL, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE CONCEPT OF GREEN INNOVATION HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH EACH OTHER. ADDITIONALLY, THE EKC HYPOTHESIS IS FOUND TO BE LEGITIMATE AND RELEVANT AS WELL. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, CREATING AWARENESS HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. WHEREAS, MORE ASSISTANCE AND INVESTMENTS HAVE ALSO BEEN RECOMMENDED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH CAN THEN ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF GREEN INNOVATION.
639	THIS CONTRIBUTION INCREASES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EU'S ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS BY EXPLORING PERCEPTIONS OF EULEX BY LOCAL RULE OF LAW EXPERTS. DRAWING ON CRITICAL PEACEBUILDING AND THE DECLINE OF NORMATIVE POWER EUROPE LITERATURES, WE DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK, UNDERLINING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTENTION-IMPLEMENTATION GAP AND THE IMPLEMENTATION-PERCEPTION GAP IN UNDERSTANDING HOW EU MISSIONS ARE PERCEIVED. BY COMPARING LOCAL EXPERT NARRATIVES TO THOSE OF EULEX JUDGES, PROSECUTORS, AND LEGAL OFFICERS, WE CONTEND THAT THE CORE PROBLEM FOR THE NEGATIVE PERCEPTION OF THE MISSION RESULTS FROM WHAT WE CALL THE DOUBLE PROXIMITY PARADOX IN PEACEBUILDING. THE FIRST PARADOX IS ONE OF IMPLEMENTATION AND TRANSPIRES WHEN AN ACTOR COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS IN A POST-CONFLICT TERRITORY DUE TO ITS CENTRALITY FOR ITS OWN INTERESTS, BUT FAILS TO UPHOLD ITS COMMITMENT AS ITS IMMEDIATE INTERESTS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH AGENTS WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PROBLEMS. THE SECOND PARADOX RELATES TO PERCEPTION AND TRANSPIRES AS HIGH COMMITMENTS RAISE EXPECTATIONS OF STRUCTURAL IMPACT. THE VISIBILITY OF THE ACTOR'S INVESTMENT MAKES ANY IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES MORE TANGIBLE. THE ACTOR IS THEREFORE, PARADOXICALLY, THE MOST OPEN TO CRITICISM IN A TERRITORY WHERE IT IS DOING THE MOST.
640	WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SELF-ENFORCING CONTRACT MODEL TO SHOW THAT BETTER ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS CAN HELP AN AREA OR A REGION UNDER A WEAK RULE OF LAW BUT WITH ORDER TO ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENTS (FDIS), WHEREAS LOWERING TAXES DOES NOT NECESSARILY HELP. USING A CROSS-REGION CHINESE DATASET, WE FIND EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH OUR THEORETICAL ANALYSIS. REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN TAX RATES AND THE PERCEIVED QUALITY OF FORMAL CONTRACTING INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT CORRELATED WITH REGIONAL FDI INFLOWS, BUT LEADERSHIP CHARACTERISTICS ARE. MOST CONVENTIONAL ECONOMIC FACTORS HAVE THE PREDICTED EFFECTS ON FDIS. THE FINDING THAT FDI IS LOWER IN LOCATIONS WHERE DOMESTIC PRIVATE FIRMS HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO FINANCE AND WHERE THE AIR QUALITY IS POOR IS ALSO NEW TO THE LITERATURE.
641	MARITIME TRANSPORT IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION OF MARINE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH IS THE ESSENTIAL OBJECT IN A SERIES OF INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LEGISLATIONS AND VARIOUS COUNTRIES' DOMESTIC LAWS. FOCUSED ON PROTECTING THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, CHINA HAS SPENT OVER 40 YEARS DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW FOR MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE IN MARITIME TRANSPORT, INCLUDING EFFORTS MADE IN LEGISLATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THE JUDICIARY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ATTEMPT TO EXAMINE CHINA'S EXPERIENCE AND PRACTICE IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, EXPLAIN THE LOGIC AND CONSIDERATION IN RELEVANT PRACTICES, AND SUMMARIZE CHINA'S PARADIGM FOR THE RULE OF LAW FOR SUCH GOVERNANCE. CHINA HAS SOUGHT TO RESOLVE TWO MAJOR ISSUES: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE BALANCE OF INTERESTS BETWEEN FLAG, COASTAL, AND PORT STATES, OFFERING A VIVID MODEL OF MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE ON WHICH OTHER COUNTRIES CAN BASE THEIR OWN LEGAL SYSTEMS. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT WITH FOLLOWING AND ENFORCING THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE SEA, NOW CHINA'S DOMESTIC LAWS HAVE FORM LAWFUL AUTHORITY ON BINDING FOREIGN VESSELS. CHINA IS CONTINUALLY STRENGTHENING THE CONSTRUCTION OF ITS LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM TO HARMONIZE INCONSISTENCIES AND KEEP PACE WITH INTERNATIONAL MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. TO ELIMINATE ADMINISTRATIVE INEFFICIENCY RESULTING FROM CUMBERSOME PROCEDURES, CHINA HAS REFORMED ITS MARITIME ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM BY CONSOLIDATING MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS. CHINA'S INDEPENDENT MARITIME JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS MEETING THE DEMAND TO DEVELOP ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIZATION, ENABLING FURTHER EXPLOITATION OF ITS PROFESSION IN SOLVING MARITIME ENVIRONMENT CASES AND IMPLEMENTING ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION.
642	XI JINPINGS THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW WAS FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER, 2020 AT THE FIRST CENTRAL CONFERENCE ON WORK RELATED TO OVERALL LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA (CPC). IT INCLUDES A WEALTH OF IDEAS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL LAW, WHICH ARE EMBODIED IN HIS PROPOSITIONS ON AND ACCOUNTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER THE CURRENT CHANGE OF THE WORLD SITUATION NEVER SEEN FOR A CENTURY. ESSENTIALLY, FOR HIS THOUGHT ON INTERNATIONAL LAW, THE CORE PRINCIPLES ARE THE FIVE PRINCIPLES OF PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE, AND THE CENTRAL IDEA IS TO PROMOTE BUILDING A COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE FOR MANKIND, AND THE MAIN PROPOSITION IS THAT THE COMMON VALUES OF MANKIND BE THE GUIDELINE FOR THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. AS REFLECTED IN HIS THOUGHT ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE OF LAW IS ALSO CLOSELY RELATED TO THE DOMESTIC RULE OF LAW. HIS PROPOSITIONS CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE OF LAW SHALL BE THE IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR CHINA TO STUDY AND PRACTICE INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND WILL PROMOTE AND THEN LEAD THE PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF CONTEMPORARY INTERNATIONAL LAW.
643	IN THIS ARTICLE, I DRAW ON NASSER HUSSAIN'S CONCEPTUALIZATIONS ON RULE OF LAW, VIOLENCE, AND EXCEPTION TO READ THE INQUIRY COMMISSION REPORT ON THE TORTURE AND MURDER OF THANGJAM MANORAMA IN 2004. WHILE CLEARLY THE COMMISSION STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE TORTURE AND MURDER OF MANORAMA, IT CONTINUES TO REPRESENT ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS TENSIONS THAT EXIST IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND EMERGENCY THAT HUSSAIN MENTIONS IN BRITISH COLONIAL TIMES. THE COMMISSION REPORT ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE THE TENSION BETWEEN POLITICAL EXIGENCIES AND RULE OF LAW BY RESTRICTING ITSELF TO BEING A PROCEDURAL EFFORT TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY REGIME THAT ENDS UP BEING CURIOUSLY REMINISCENT OF COLONIAL REPORTS. IN OTHER WORDS, RATHER THAN RECOGNIZING THE ROLE OF EXTRAORDINARY LAWS SUCH AS AFSPA (ARMED FORCES SPECIAL POWERS ACT) IN CREATING SUCH SITUATIONS, THE REPORT PRIMARILY RECOGNIZES PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE AGAINST MANORAMA. THE REPORT THEN ENDS UP BEING A PATERNALISTIC SYMBOLIC ACT THAT FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POLITICAL AUTHORITY OF THE STATE IN CONFLICT AREAS AND THE REGIME OF IMPUNITY CREATED BY THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE LAWS SUCH AS THE AFSPA. HOWEVER, I NOTE THAT IN THE POSTCOLONIAL CONTEXT, THE CONTESTATIONS OF HYPERLEGALITY ALSO REFLECT A TENSION BETWEEN A REJECTION OF EMERGENCY PROVISIONS FOR THE NORTHEAST AND AN INABILITY TO EMBRACE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE THAT THE CONSTITUTION OTHERWISE PROHIBITS. I ARGUE THAT THE POSTCOLONIAL STATE IS UNABLE TO CONTAIN THIS TENSION SUCCESSFULLY BETWEEN POLITICAL EXIGENCIES AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE THANGJAM MANORAMA CASE DUE TO THE CONTINUED DEMANDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY BY THOSE RESISTING THIS LAW AND PROTESTING HER AND OTHER DEATHS. REGARDLESS OF THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR, THE REPORT FOLLOWING THIS PARTICULAR DEATH APPEARS TO HAVE GENERATED A FISSURE IN THE POSTCOLONIAL LEGAL NARRATIVE THAT REVEALS THE EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE EMBEDDED IN THE AFSPA REGIME THAT CANNOT BE EASILY EMBRACED AND YET CANNOT BE DENIED AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO CONTAIN AND LEGITIMIZE.
644	THE PROBLEM OF THE INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE ECONOMY AND LAW IS CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED MOST DISTINCTLY IN THE ACTIVITY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL BODIES. IT IS JUSTIFIED THAT, UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF GENERAL GLOBALIZING PROCESSES, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND JUDICIAL STRUCTURAL INSTITUTIONS BECOMES EVEN CLOSER, BECAUSE EFFECTIVE MARKET RELATIONS EXIST ONLY IN A LEGAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH PROVIDES ALL INTERESTED AGENTS WITH PERSONAL PROPERTY AND NONPROPERTY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH HIGH INSTITUTIONAL AND PROCEDURAL STANDARDS IN THE SPHERE OF JUSTICE.
645	WHERE AUTOCRATIZATION THROUGH CLASSICAL COUPS BELONGS TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY, DEMOCRACIES ARE TODAY PRIMARILY DEMOLISHED THROUGH "AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM", A GOVERNING TECHNIQUE DESTROYING DEMOCRACIES DELIBERATELY AND INCREMENTALLY WITHIN THE LAW ITSELF. AS A RESULT, IT OFTEN GOES UNNOTICED BY HIDING IN JUDICIAL ROBES. THIS MAKES IT HARDER TO CATEGORIZE REGIMES AND NECESSITATES A GREATER ANALYTICAL SENSITIVITY OF THE INDICES THAT MANY DECISION-MAKERS - LIKE IN OUR CASE THE EUROPEAN UNION - HAVE COME TO RELY ON WHEN MONITORING AND ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY. BY EXEMPLIFYING THE WORKINGS OF AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM IN HUNGARY AND POLAND, WE FIRSTLY DISCUSS WHAT IS NEEDED TO MEASURE THIS NEW TYPE OF AUTOCRATIZATION AND HOW SOME OF THE LEADING INDICES FALL SHORT IN THIS REGARD. WE SECONDLY DISCUSS HOW RELYING ON LESS ADEQUATE INDICES LIKE POLITY5 AND FREEDOM HOUSE MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR AUTHORITIES LIKE THE EU TO MONITOR, CRITICIZE, AND SANCTION VIOLATIONS OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES. IN ARGUING THAT AN INDEX LIKE V-DEM WOULD OFFER A BETTER FOUNDATION FOR TACKLING THE UNION'S RULE OF LAW CONUNDRUM, WE STRESS THAT THE EU'S PROBLEMS ARE ONLY IN PART DUE TO THE USE OF MEDIOCRE INDICES BUT ALSO LINKED TO INCREASED POLITICIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN THE EU.
646	IN THE SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN REGION, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) SUPPORTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RULE OF LAW, PRESSURING FOR BOTH THE ADOPTION OF INSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE ENHANCEMENT OF COURT ADMINISTRATION CAPABILITIES. DRAWING ON A SET OF INTERVIEWS WITH KEY EU AND DOMESTIC ACTORS, THIS STUDY COMPARES MOROCCO AND JORDAN, EXAMINING CHANGES ADOPTED AT THE INSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL SINCE THE 'ARAB SPRING' BROKE OUT. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT EXTERNAL INCENTIVES FOR CHANGE PENETRATED ONLY THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL OF DOMESTIC JUDICIAL SYSTEMS, WHILE A PATH-DEPENDENT EFFECT PERSISTED AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. THE EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THE THESIS THAT IN AREAS OF LOW POLITICS EVEN A MERE NORMATIVE PRESSURE IS ABLE TO DRIVE RULE ADOPTION, WHEREAS IN MORE SENSITIVE POLICY AREAS, AS IN THE CASE OF INSTITUTIONAL JUDICIAL GUARANTEES, THE HIGHER COSTS OF ADAPTATION MAKE VETO PLAYERS RESISTANT TO EXTERNAL INFLUENCES FOR CHANGE.
647	IN 2008, ECUADOR RAISED THE NEED FOR THE CREATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM WITHIN THE UNION OF SOUTH AMERICAN NATIONS (UNASUR). ANY SYSTEM OF INVESTMENT ARBITRATION SHOULD COMPLY WITH DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW WHICH PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND LEGITIMACY FOR ARBITRAL DECISIONS AND THUS SHOULD AVOID POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BIAS. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS LATIN AMERICA'S HISTORICAL INCLINATION TOWARDS ARBITRATION AND FOCUSES ON THE 2014 UNASUR PROJECT'S PROPOSED METHOD OF APPOINTMENT AND DISQUALIFICATION OF ARBITRATORS, AND ITS APPROACH TO THE EXECUTION OF AWARDS. BY WAY OF COMPARISON WITH INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) TRIBUNALS, THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO SUGGEST HOW AN APPLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW COULD HELP GUIDE AND STRUCTURE ARBITRATORS' BEHAVIOURS IN THE PROPOSED UNASUR PROJECT AS WELL AS UNDER THE CURRENT ICSID FRAMEWORK TO AVOID ARBITRATORS' DEVIATION FROM THE LAW AND PREVENT THEIR CREATIVE, INDEPENDENT INTERPRETATIONS.
648	THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL ACT 2016 (NSCA) CAME INTO FORCE ON THE 1ST OF AUGUST 2016 AND IS A STRINGENT SECURITY LEGISLATION THAT THREATENS MALAYSIAN DEMOCRACY BECAUSE IT HAS PROVISIONS THAT INFRINGES FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS DEFINED IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION (FC) OF MALAYSIA AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LAWS SUCH AS THE SECURITY OFFENCES (SPECIAL MEASURES) ACT 2012 AND THE PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT 2015 WHICH WERE ENACTED TO COUNTER THE THREAT OF MALAYSIANS JOINING THE ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRIA (ISIS). DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE LAWS, THE NSCA WAS ENACTED. GIVEN THE LAWS THAT ALREADY AUTHORIZE DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGE OR TRIAL, THE NEED FOR THE NSCA HAS RAISED QUESTIONS. THIS STUDY CRITICALLY ASSESSES THE VALIDITY OF THE ATTACKS THAT THE NSCA CONTRAVENES OR CONFLICTS WITH THE FC IN TWO STAGES. FIRST, IT ATTEMPTS TO ASCERTAIN IF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OR RIGHTS SAID TO BE EXTINGUISHED OR ERODED BY THE NSCA ARE REALLY EMBODIED IN THE FC AND, IF SO, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY ARE A PART THE FOUNDING DOCUMENT. NEXT, IT CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE PROVISIONS OF THE NSCA TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH THEY REPRESENT A NEW ASSAULT ON CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR PRINCIPLES. IN LINE WITH THIS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW ON THE NSCA USING A PURELY DOCTRINAL RESEARCH METHOD WHERE KEY DOCUMENTS COMPRISING THE NSCA, THE FC AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE ANALYSED.
649	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HOW THE APPLICATION THE EU CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS CONTRIBUTES TO THE FIGHT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU. AFTER OUTLINING THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO IT FOCUSES ON TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW THE CHARTER COULD AND SHOULD PLAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. AS TO MEMBER STATE-LEVEL RULE OF LAW BREAKDOWNS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CHARTER HAS EITHER BEEN MISSING IN THE SHADOW OF ARTICLE 19(1) OF THE TREATY ON EUROPEAN UNION OR THREATENED TO UNDERMINE THE FIGHT FOR THE RULE OF LAW WHEN THE PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE WAS REDUCED TO ARTICLE 47 CHARTER STANDING ALONE. AS TO SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL RULE OF LAW ISSUES, WHERE THE CHARTER'S APPLICABILITY UNDER ARTICLE 51 CFR IS UNCONTROVERSIAL, WE SHOW THAT IT HAS NONETHELESS SO FAR BEEN APPLIED TO A PROBLEMATICALLY LIMITED EXTENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY CLEAR WITH REGARD TO PARTY-FINANCING AT EU-LEVEL. THIS FILE OFFERS A CASE IN POINT TO SHOW HOW TAKING THE CHARTER SERIOUSLY COULD MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PROTECTING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU.
650	THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS HOW A RULE OF LAW APPROACH, CENTRAL TO THE UNITED NATIONS' (UN) ACTIVITIES SINCE 2004, COULD FACILITATE THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS ITS AGENCIES. BUT WHAT DO WE MEAN BY RULE OF LAW: THE ANGLO-AMERICAN JUDICIALIZED UNDERSTANDING OR THE CIVIL LAW MODEL, L'ETAT DE DROIT OR RECHTSSTAAT, THAT IS MORE ROOTED IN THE GOVERNANCE OF THE STATE? INDEED, BOTH APPROACHES ARE RELEVANT TO A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF RULE OF LAW IN UN OPERATIONS. AND WHILE A STATE THAT INCREASINGLY ADOPTS A RULE OF LAW STANCE WILL, WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE UN, BETTER PROTECT AND EMPOWER ALL PERSONS ON ITS TERRITORY, THE UN ITSELF MUST ALSO UPHOLD RULE OF LAW. THE CRUCIBLE OF DISPLACEMENT PROVIDES A PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING CONTEXT FOR RULE OF LAW, SINCE IT DOES NOT NEATLY FIT THE WESTPHALIAN MODEL THAT TRADITIONALLY FRAMES INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND UN OPERATIONS; DISPLACEMENT ALSO REVEALS THE PROBLEMS WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE UN OPERATION - EVEN UNHCR WILL HAVE DIFFERENT MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE DIFFERENT STATES INVOLVED AND AFFECTED.
651	ALTHOUGH LAW AND ORDER IS OFTEN CONFLATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW, THE TWO CONCEPTS ARE ASYMMETRICALLY OPPOSED. ASYMMETRICAL OPPOSITES DO NOT OCCUPY POLES ON A SCALE OF SHARED VALUES. ONE IS NOT A NEGATIVE OF THE OTHER, AS RULE OF MEN TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN TO THE RULE OF LAW. NOR DOES ONE OCCUPY PART OF A CONTINUUM EXTENDING DOWN FROM THE OTHER, LIKE RULE BY LAW IN RELATION TO THE RULE-OF-LAW IDEAL. THEY ARE NOT SYMMETRICALLY RELATED. THEY ARE OPPOSED BECAUSE THEIR SPECIFIC CONTENTS ARE ADVERSE. "WHEREAS THE RULE OF LAW IS CHARACTERISTICALLY CONCERNED WITH ELIMINATING ARBITRARINESS THROUGH GENERAL RULES APPLIED JURIDICALLY, LAW AND ORDER IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH ELIMINATING RESTLESSNESS THROUGH PARTICULARISTIC INJUNCTIONS DELIVERED ADMINISTRATIVELY. DIFFERENT VALUES INHERE TO EACH. THEIR OPPOSITION IS IN PRINCIPLE. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CANNOT BE CONFLATED WITHOUT OBFUSCATING THEIR DISTINCTIVE QUALITIES, THEREBY CASTING DOUBT ON THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A POLITICAL IDEAL.
652	THE PRESENT ARTICLE MAPS THE EXPLICIT REFERENCES TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE JURISPRUDENCE OF THE ECTHR BY EXAMINING THE JUDGMENTS OF THE GRAND CHAMBER AND THE PLENARY COURT. ON THE BASIS OF THE STRUCTURED ANALYSIS IT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENTS OF THE COURT'S RULE OF LAW CONCEPT AND CONTRAST IT WITH THE AUTHOR'S WORKING DEFINITION AND THE POSITION OF OTHER COUNCIL OF EUROPE ORGANS. THE REVIEW OF THE CASE-LAW INDICATES THAT THE COURT PRIMARILY ASSOCIATES THE RULE OF LAW WITH ACCESS TO COURT, JUDICIAL SAFEGUARDS, LEGALITY AND DEMOCRACY, AND IT FOLLOWS A MODERATELY THICK DEFINITION OF THE CONCEPT INCLUDING FORMAL, PROCEDURAL AND SOME SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENTS. THE RULE OF LAW REFERENCES ARE PREDOMINANTLY ANCILLARY ARGUMENTS GIVING WEIGHT TO OTHER CONVENTION-BASED CONSIDERATIONS AND IT IS NOT APPLIED AS A SELF-STANDING STANDARD.
653	SINCE 1978, THE CHINESE REFORM POLICY HAS BROUGHT FAST ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE BUT ALSO CONSIDERABLY HIGHER CRIME LEVELS. CHINA'S RAPID MODERNIZATION HAS RESULTED IN A SITUATION OF INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES AND DURKHEIMIAN ANOMIE. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT RESPONDS TO THE WORSENING CRIME SITUATION WITH PUNITIVE CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, ESPECIALLY UNDER THE 'STRIKE HARD' POLICY. HOWEVER, A PUNITIVE CRIME CONTROL IDEOLOGY AND REPRESSIVE CRIMINAL NORMS ARE NEITHER EFFECTIVE IN STOPPING THE CRIME WAVE NOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AIM TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW. AFTER EXAMINING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE STRIKE HARD POLICY HAS BROUGHT TO THE CHINESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE, WE PRESENT FINDINGS FROM A RECENT WEB SURVEY AMONG CHINESE STUDENTS IN GERMANY (N=CA. 900). WE USE THESE DATA TO EXPLORE THE PUNITIVE ATTITUDES, ESP. TOWARDS THE DEATH PENALTY, AMONG THE CHINESE YOUNG ELITE.
654	OECD COUNTRIES ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORKING IN SEVERAL DOMAINS, INCLUDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, ENVIRONMENTAL TAXES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY. ON THIS PREMISE, THE STUDY'S MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY , ENVIRONMENTAL TAXES AND NATURAL RESOURCES ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THE STUDY USED THREE DIMENSIONS OF ENERGY MEASUREMENT: (I) ENERGY EFFICIENCY, (II) ENERGY PRODUCTIVITY, AND (III) ENERGY INTENSITY FOR OECD. AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE STUDY IS THE USE OF THE "RULE OF LAW"TO IMPLEMENT TAX REFORMS AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY. MALMQUIST-LUENBERGER AND THE SUPER SBM-DEA ARE USED TO MEASURE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. FRANCE, GREECE, ITALY, LUXEMBURG, SWEDEN, LITHUANIA, COLOMBIA, AND TURKEY'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY RANGE IS BETWEEN 1-1.5. SWITZERLAND'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY RANGES FROM 1.5-2.0. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, JAPAN, THE UK, AUSTRALIA, GERMANY, CANADA, AND SOUTH KOREA'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY RANGES ARE BETWEEN 0.5-1.0. BEYOND THAT, THE HIGHER ENERGY-INTENSIVE COUNTRIES ARE CANADA, ESTONIA, SOUTH KOREA, FINLAND, THE USA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AUSTRALIA, AND THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC. REGRESSION ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL TAX AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY AND LOWERING ENERGY INTENSITY. THE IMPACT STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL TAX IS HIGHER THAN GREEN TECHNOLOGY TO BOOST ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND LIMIT ENERGY INTENSITY. INCREASING RENT ON NATURAL RESOURCES CAN RAISE THE ENERGY INTENSITY AND AFFECTS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. THE STUDY FOUND THAT "THE RULE OF LAW"IS IMPORTANT FOR PUTTING GREEN TECHNOLOGIES AND TAX REFORM INTO PRACTICE. DUE TO "THE RULE OF LAW", INDUSTRIES MUST ABIDE BY THE GREEN PRINCIPLE AND PAY ATTENTION TO GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT.(C) 2022 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

655	THE ARTICLE BEGINS WITH ASKING TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST, DOES THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT ( MOVEMENT) UNDERMINE THE CITY'S RULE OF LAW? SECOND, IS THE MOVEMENT AN ACT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE? ONE MAY ARGUE THAT THE MOVEMENT BREAKS THE LAW IN ORDER TO BETTER ADHERE TO THE CITY'S HIGHER LAW OF UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE AND THEREBY CONTINUES TO PAY RESPECT TO THE LAW. NEVERTHELESS, SEVERAL MAJOR SURVEYS FIND THAT UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AS THE CITY'S HIGHER LAW. THE CLAIM OF THE MOVEMENT DOES NOT SEEM JUSTIFIED BY A RELATED HIGHER LAW AND IS THEREFORE NOT GOVERNED BY LAW. MOREOVER, MAJOR THEORISTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MAINTAIN THAT CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ONLY MAKES SENSE IN A DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. NEVERTHELESS, HONG KONG IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC POLITY, AND THE MOVEMENT DISAGREES WITH PARTS OF THE KERNEL OF THE CITY'S CONSTITUTIONAL SCHEME. THE MOVEMENT CANNOT RELY ON THE MAJOR THEORIES OF CIVIL OBEDIENCE TO CLAIMTO STAY UNDER LAW. IN THE PAST DECADES, THE MAJOR EVENTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WORLDWIDE, SUCH AS THE 'COLOUR REVOLUTIONS', MAINLY TOOK PLACE IN NON-DEMOCRATIC REGIMES. MAJOR THEORIES OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ARE UNABLE TO DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN AND EVALUATE THESE EVENTS. IN ORDER TO FILL THIS THEORETICAL VOID, BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE UMBRELLA MOVEMENT, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN THIS REGARD IS UNDERSTOOD AS A LEGITIMACY-BUILDING AND REGIME-TRANSFORMATIVE POWER. ITS NATURE IMPLIES ITS OWN RATIONALE TO ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW AND THE MAJOR PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. MY ACCOUNT MAY ALSO APPLY TO THE WESTERN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES THAT ENCOUNTER LEGITIMACY OR REGIME CHALLENGES.
656	WE ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THE RESEARCH AIMS OF THE TWO BOOKS EXAMINED BY THIS SYMPOSIUM AND THEIR DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND LAW'S ROLE IN GENERATING AND CONTESTING SOCIAL INJUSTICE. WE ARE ALSO INTRIGUED BY THE PROPOSAL IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS SYMPOSIUM, NOTABLY TO EXPAND THE NORMATIVE REACH OF THE RULE-OF-LAW IDEAL TO PRIVATE ACTORS, IN ORDER TO TRANSFORM IT INTO AN ALLY OF COUNTER-HEGEMONIC ACTION. IN OUR RESEARCH, WE SHARE A SIMILAR RESEARCH FOCUS (DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS), METHODOLOGY (CASE-STUDIES) AND CONCERNS (HARMFUL EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT INTERVENTIONS) WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE TWO BOOKS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, WE WANT TO THINK TOGETHER WITH THE EDITORS OF THE SYMPOSIUM - BY EXAMINING THE CASE-STUDY OF THE HIDROITUANGO PROJECT IN COLOMBIA (HEREINAFTER, 'HIDROITUANGO') - WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW CAN INDEED BE REIMAGINED TO LIMIT THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF POWER BY PRIVATE ACTORS, AND WHAT BENEFITS THIS MIGHT CREATE FOR DEALING WITH SOCIAL INJUSTICE. HOWEVER, SINCE NEITHER BHATT NOR LANDER ADVANCES AN EXPLICIT ACCOUNT OF RULE OF LAW IN THEIR BOOKS, OUR CRITIQUE IN THIS PIECE IS ADDRESSED NOT AT THEM, BUT RATHER AT THE THEORISTS AND ADVOCATES OF RULE OF LAW AS A POLITICAL IDEAL.
657	THE NEW REGIME OF CONDITIONALITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW, UNDERSTOOD AS THE RULE OF LAW (NEW CONDITIONALITY), APPEARS TO BE CONTRARY TO THE EUROPEAN UNION TREATIES, IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE ITS ESSENTIAL PROVISIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF LEGAL CERTAINTY WHICH UNDERLIES THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONDITIONALITY IS BASED ON FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR THE RISK OF ILLEGALITY, THAT IS, IN SUM, FOR LAWFUL ACTS OF A MEMBER STATE WHICH MAY POSSIBLY TURN OUT TO BE UNLAWFUL, BUT AFTER FINANCIAL SANCTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLIED. THIS PUBLICATION DEALS WITH THE IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF LEGAL RISKS THAT GIVE RISE TO FINANCIAL RISKS. AFTER CHARACTERISING THE BASIC EU BUDGETARY INSTRUMENTS ON THE BASIS OF THE ACQUIS OF ECONOMIC AND LEGAL SCIENCES (WHICH IMPLIES THE APPLICATION OF THE EXTERNAL INTEGRATION METHOD), USING A DOGMATIC METHOD, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY OF BLOCKING BY A MEMBER STATE THE INTRODUCTION INTO EU LAW OF A MECHANISM BINDING THE BUDGET WITH THE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD RULE OF LAW IN CONNECTION WITH THE SIGNALLED INCOMPATIBILITIES OF THE NEW CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM WITH PRIMARY UNION LAW. THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT LEGAL POSSIBILITIES AN INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATE HAS TO COUNTERACT A UNION REGULATION PRIMA FACIE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, APART FROM CHALLENGING THE REGULATION BEFORE THE COURT OF JUSTICE (REVIEW OF THE LEGALITY OF LEGAL ACTS), ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IMPOSES AN OBLIGATION TO FIRST COUNTERACT BAD LEGISLATION (DECENT LEGISLATION AS AN ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW) AND ONLY AS A LAST RESORT TO LODGE A COMPLAINT WITH THE COURT AGAINST A GIVEN ACT OF DERIVED UNION LAW.
658	THE ISSUE OF WHEN AND HOW DISABLED PEOPLE CAN BE LAWFULLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR LIBERTY IS A MAJOR CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGE FOR MENTAL CAPACITY LAW. PEOPLE WHO LACK CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO TREATMENT THAT DEPRIVES THEM OF THEIR LIBERTY MUST HAVE ACCESS TO SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 5 ECHR. THE CURRENT DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY SAFEGUARDS ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE UNFIT FOR PURPOSE, AND A REPLACEMENT SCHEME, THE 'LIBERTY PROTECTION SAFEGUARDS' (LPS) WERE PROPOSED BY THE LAW COMMISSION OF ENGLAND AND WALES IN 2017. THESE SAFEGUARDS WERE LEGISLATED FOR IN 2018/19 IN THE MENTAL CAPACITY (AMENDMENT) ACT AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2022. AT THE TIME THE REFORMS WERE BEING DEBATED IN PARLIAMENT, MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS EXPRESSED SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS, SOME GOING SO FAR AS TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE NOT 'GOOD LAW'. IN THIS PAPER, I EVALUATE TO WHAT EXTENT THE LPS IS (OR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE) 'GOOD LAW', DRAWING ON TWO CONTRASTING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS TO GUIDE THAT ANALYSIS: BINGHAM'S (2007) SUB-PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW; AND THE CAPABILITIES APPROACH DEVELOPED BY SEN AND NUSSBAUM (AMONG OTHERS). I ARGUE THAT DESPITE THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT CAUSED SUCH CONCERN DURING ITS PASSAGE THROUGH PARLIAMENT, IF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS IS GROUNDED IN A STRONG SOCIAL JUSTICE CONCEPTUAL FRAME, THE LPS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A POSITIVE LEGAL REFORM.
659	THE RAPID ADVANCE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PAST DECADE RESULTS IN THE CONSTANT EMERGENCE OF DISTINCT NEW-STYLE INFRINGEMENT OF RIGHTS, UNDER THE LACK OF PROPER REGULATIONS. THE MEANING OF LAW EDUCATION LIES IN HAVING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE PRECIOUS AND IMPORTANCE OF LAW AND FURTHER ABIDE THE LAW. LAW AND EDUCATION ARE THE IMPORTANT PARTNERS TO GUARANTEE THE BASIC FREEDOM OF HUMANS. TO CONSTRUCT A COMPLETE SOCIETY, PREPARATION AND TRAINING ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT; AND, PREPARATION AND TRAINING ARE BASED ON EDUCATION. AIMING AT COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GUANGXI PROVINCE, AS THE RESEARCH OBJECTS, TOTAL 360 COPIES OF QUESTIONNAIRE ARE DISTRIBUTED, AND 267 VALID COPIES ARE RETRIEVED, WITH THE RETRIEVAL RATE 74%. THE RESEARCH RESULTS CONCLUDE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN 1. LAW EDUCATION AND LEGAL KNOWLEDGE, 2.LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE TOWARD RULE OF LAW, AND 3. LAW EDUCATION AND ATTITUDE TOWARD RULE OF LAW. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH RESULTS, SUGGESTIONS ARE PROPOSED, EXPECTING TO HELP ROOT DOMESTIC LAW EDUCATION AND CULTIVATE STUDENTS' CORRECT LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD ATTITUDE TOWARD RULE OF LAW TO REALLY PRACTICE IT IN LIFE.
660	HOW DO WE BEST DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AGAINST ITS ATTACKERS, BOTH WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OUTSIDE OF IT? OFTEN, THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN PERCEIVED AS A DOMAIN BELONGING TO JURISTS, LAWYERS, BUREAUCRATS, OR POLITICIANS. YET AT ITS MOST FUNDAMENTAL, THE RULE OF LAW NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT OF FROM A CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE. WHEN ENFORCED, IT GUARANTEES FREEDOMS AND LIBERTIES FOR CITIZENS AND ENABLES US TO LIVE PEACEFULLY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE A CITIZEN-CENTRIC RULE OF LAW AGENDA BASED ON A DEEP CONVICTION THAT IT IS IF AND WHEN IT BECOMES A CITIZEN-BASED SOCIETAL PRINCIPLE THAT ITS MANY ATTACKERS ARE BEST COUNTERED. WE DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES AND NECESSITIES OF RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AND PROPOSE AN ASSESSMENT APPROACH CALLED THE "LIVING LIST". WE CLOSE WITH A CALL FOR CITIZEN-SCHOLARS TO FIGHT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, THE MOST PRECIOUS HUMAN INVENTION OF ALL TIME.
661	CHINA'S RULE OF LAW TOOK AN UGLY TURN IN LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THE LEGAL REFORM WAS ANNOUNCED. THE COUNTRY DETAINED LAWYERS ON 9 JULY 2015. THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED THE "RULE OF MAN" FROM THE PAST AND ACTS LIKE AN "ORGANISATIONAL EMPEROR". WHILE IT TOOK THE WEST A FEW CENTURIES TO BUILD ITS SYSTEM OF RULE OF LAW, IT WILL TAKE CHINA EVEN LONGER TO DO SO.
662	EU CIVILIAN MISSIONS ARE A TOOL TO BRIDGE NEW SECURITY GAPS. THEY FOCUS ON SECURITY PROBLEMS THAT CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED BY MILITARY CAPABILITIES ALONE. THESE MISSIONS OPERATIONALIZE THE IDEA OF LIBERAL PEACE, IE THE LINK BETWEEN THE (DEMOCRATIC, LIBERAL ETC.) 'QUALITY' OF DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONS AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MISSIONS IS TO REFORM (OR ESTABLISH) A STATE SECURITY SECTOR BASED UPON THESE QUALITIES. TAKING THE MOST ADVANCED EU CIVILIAN MISSION TO DATE, EULEX KOSOVO, AS AN OBJECT OF STUDY, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES A PARTICULAR LEGAL PROBLEM THAT ENSUES WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS 'EXPORTED': IN ORDER TO FULFIL ITS RULE OF LAW-EXPORTING TASK, THE MISSION ENJOYS BROAD EXECUTIVE POWERS. THIS, IN TURN, REQUIRES THAT THE MISSION ITSELF MUST BE BOUND BY THE PRINCIPLES IT SEEKS TO 'EXPORT'. THE RULE OF LAW SERVES, IN OTHER WORDS, BOTH AS A POLICY-TOOL AND AS A CONSTRAINT FOR EULEX. AS BOTH DIMENSIONS ARE CONNECTED, THE FAILURE OF ONE WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT WHILE THE HYBRID APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW BY EULEX IS A PROMISING TOOL TO ADDRESS SECURITY GAPS RESULTING FROM NEW THREATS IN POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, THE PRESENT WEAKNESS OF THE CONSTRAINT FUNCTION NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MISSION AS A WHOLE.
663	DESPITE A GROWING INTEREST IN THE INFLUENCE OF MANAGERIAL CHARACTERISTICS ON FIRMS' STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, SCHOLARLY KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED WITH REGARD TO HOW AND WHEN PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES OF EXECUTIVES AFFECT FIRMS' FOREIGN ENTRY MODE DECISION. BUILDING ON BEHAVIORAL DECISION-MAKING THEORY, WE ADDRESS THIS GAP BY INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' (CEOS') OPTIMISM ON FIRMS' FOREIGN MARKET EQUITY MODE CHOICE. IN ADDITION, WE EXAMINE THE MODERATING INFLUENCE OF THE HOST COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW ON THIS RELATIONSHIP. USING PRIMARY DATA FROM 227 SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMES) IN GHANA, WE FOUND THAT INCREASES IN THE LEVELS OF CEOS' OPTIMISM ARE RELATED TO THE INCREASES IN PREFERENCE FOR EQUITY ENTRY MODE. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS AMPLIFIED WHEN CEOS PERCEIVE THE HOST COUNTRY TO HAVE STRONGER RULE OF LAW. THE FINDINGS HAVE THEORETICAL, MANAGERIAL, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR SMES' FOREIGN MARKET ENTRY MODE STRATEGY.
664	THIS ARTICLE CHARTS THE EVOLUTION OF PARTY DOCTRINE REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE FORMATIVE PERIOD FROM 2002 UNTIL 2014. THE ARTICLE USES THE REPORTED CONTENT OF POLITBURO STUDY SESSIONS TO SHED LIGHT ON LEADERSHIP DELIBERATIONS DURING THIS PERIOD, AND SHOWS HOW THE POLITBURO'S CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW DEVELOPED. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CONCEPTS THAT SHAPE THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE EARLY PART OF HU JINTAO'S TERM IN OFFICE. IN PARTICULAR, THE RULE OF LAW WAS RECONCILED WITH PARTY LEADERSHIP BY PRESENTING THESE IDEAS AS PARTS OF A VAGUE ORGANIC UNITY. THE ARTICLE ALSO CONTRASTS AN EARLIER VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS SOMETHING THAT RECTIFIES INSTITUTIONS WITH A LATER VISION OF THE RULE OF LAW AS SOMETHING THAT RECTIFIES CADRES. TOGETHER, THESE CONCEPTS UNDERPIN CURRENT PARTY DOCTRINE ON THE RULE OF LAW.
665	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE MOTIVES THAT DRIVE THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE'S (COE) ENGAGEMENT BEYOND ITS MEMBERSHIP AND EXAMINES THE PATHWAYS THAT THE ORGANISATION USES TO EXPORT ITS CORE NORMS AND VALUES. BASED ON THE DISCUSSION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COE IN ITS CORE ISSUE AREAS - THAT IS, HUMAN RIGHTS, DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW - THREE ANALYTICALLY DISTINCT INSTRUMENTS CAN BE DISCERNED THAT THE ORGANISATION EMPLOYS TO INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT IN NEIGHBOURING REGIONS AND BEYOND: 'INCLUSION,' 'FIELDWORK' AND 'VOICE'. HOWEVER, THE DISCUSSION ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT THE COE'S INSTITUTIONS ARE LACKING A UNIFIED STRATEGY AS TO HOW TO ENGAGE WITH NON-MEMBER STATES.
666	IN SPRING OF 2011, PETER KING (R-NY) CONVENED A HEARING TITLED 'THE EXTENT OF RADICALIZATION AMONG AMERICAN MUSLIMS' IN THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPANTS CRITIQUED THE HEARINGS AND CONTEXTUALIZED THE PROCEEDINGS WITHIN THE LONG HISTORY OF INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM IN THE USA. THEY ARGUED THAT THE HEARINGS WERE A THREAT TO THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF, A VIOLATION OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S GUARANTEE OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION. REPUBLICAN PARTICIPANTS SHARED CONCERNS ABOUT THREATS TO THE CONSTITUTION BUT SUGGESTED THAT THE HEARINGS WERE PART OF A STRATEGY TO COMBAT THIS THREAT. NUMEROUS REPUBLICAN PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED FORMS OF ISLAMIC LAW, OR SHARIA LAW, AS THE PRIMARY THREAT TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE RULE OF LAW (ROL). DESPITE OPPOSING POSITIONS, ALL ACTORS AGREED THAT THE 'ROL' IS THAT WHICH WILL SAVE THE NATION FROM THREATS POSED FROM BOTH OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE NATION AND, AS SUCH, IT IS THE ROL ITSELF THAT MUST BE PROTECTED. IN THIS SENSE, THE 'ROL' ENSURED BY THE CONSTITUTION INADVERTENTLY BECAME THE PRIMARY OBJECT OF THE HEARINGS. IN THIS ESSAY, WE BRING ANALYTICAL APPROACHES FROM PERFORMANCE STUDIES AND ANTHROPOLOGY TO ARGUE THAT THE HEARINGS IMPEL A RE-EXAMINATION OF THE CONCEPT OF 'ROL' ITSELF. RATHER THAN SIMPLY ADDRESSING THE LEGISLATIVE EFFECTS OF THE HEARINGS, WE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY REVEAL ABOUT THE PERFORMATIVE AND CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF THE LAW AND THE LAWMAKING PROCESS. WHILE CRITICS OF THE HEARINGS DERISIVELY REFERRED TO THEM AS 'POLITICAL THEATER', WE SUGGEST THAT IT IS THE NATURE OF THE KING HEARINGS AS STAGED PUBLIC SPECTACLE THAT IMBUE THEM WITH A POLITICALLY PERFORMATIVE POWER. WE ALSO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF SHARIA PANIC IN CONTEMPORARY US AMERICAN POLITICAL AND LEGAL DISCOURSE.
667	CHINA'S PROJECT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS DESTINED TO HAVE ITS CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. CHINA ALSO NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT OF THE WAY OF DEVELOPING ITS OWN MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW SO AS TO ACHIEVE A RULE OF LAW SOCIETY THAT IS UNIVERSAL IN MODERN SOCIETY. MANY RULE OF LAW COUNTRIES, SUCH AS ENGLAND, GERMANY AND FRANCE, STARTED THEIR RULE OF LAW PROJECT WITH THEIR OWN MODEL. CHINA SHOULD LEARN FROM THE MERITS OF THESE DIFFERENT MODELS. NEVERTHELESS, CHINA SHOULD ALSO TRY TO SOLVE THE KEY PROBLEM OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IS THE ENERGIZING OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CHINESE CONSTITUTION.
668	KEEPING A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT IN THIS ERA SEEMS UNREALISTIC DUE TO NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS; AMONG THOSE, CARBON EMISSION IS THE MOST DAUNTING ELEMENT TO IMBALANCED THE GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH COMPLICATIONS MOTIVATE THE PRESENT AUTHORS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GEOPOLITICAL RISK, GREEN FINANCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN ATTAINING A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA. THE DATA SERIES OF THE YEARS FROM 1995 TO 2020 IS TESTED THROUGH THE BOOTSTRAPPED ARDL METHOD UNDER THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF EKC THEORY. BEFORE EMPLOYING THE BARDL TECHNIQUE, THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND UNIT ROOT TEST IS TESTED ON THE DATA TO CHECK THE NORMALITY AND VALIDITY OF THE DATA SET. AFTERWARD, THE BARDL METHOD FOR LONG-AND SHORT-RUN COINTEGRATION IS ANALYZED BASED ON THE SIZE AND WEAK POWER CHARACTERISTICS. FINALLY, THE GRANGER CAUSALITY TEST PROPOSED BY TROSTER ET AL. (2018) IS EXAMINED TO CHECK THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF GEOPOLITICAL RISK, GREEN FINANCE, AND THE RULE OF LAW WITH A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE GRANGER TEST IDENTIFIED THE UNIDIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY AMONG CE TO GFIN AND LAW, ALTHOUGH OTHER VARIABLES SHOW THE BI-DIRECTIONAL CAUSALITY. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS INDICATE THE POSITIVE ASSOCIATION OF GPD AND GPR WITH CE (CARBON EMISSION) IN CHINA'S LONG-RUN AND SHORT-RUN DATA. A SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE RELA-TIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GFIN, GDP SQUARE, AND THE RULE OF LAW WITH CE IS ANALYZED IN BOTH THE LONG AND SHORT-RUN ON THE GROUNDS OF CHINA'S ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, THE CUMSUM AND CUMSUMSQ TEST CONFIRMS THE STABILITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE MODEL. FURTHERMORE, BASED ON THE FINDINGS, PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ARE DEVELOPED TO ENDURE A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA.
669	I ARGUE THAT THE RULE OF LAW CONSISTS OF MANY DIMENSIONS AND THAT MUCH INFORMATION IS LOST WHEN VARIABLES PROXYING FOR THESE DIMENSIONS ARE SIMPLY AGGREGATED. I DRAW ON THE MOST IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS FROM VARIOUS LEGAL TRADITIONS TO PROPOSE A CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW LIKELY TO FIND GENERAL SUPPORT. TO MAKE THE CONCEPT MEASURABLE, AN IDEAL APPROACH IS CONTRASTED WITH A PRAGMATIC ONE. THE PRAGMATIC APPROACH CONSISTS OF EIGHT DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. I SHOW THAT THE BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THEM ARE USUALLY VERY LOW, EVIDENCE THAT MORE FINE-GRAINED INDICATORS OF THE RULE OF LAW, RATHER THAN A SINGLE HARD-TO-INTERPRET ONE, ARE NECESSARY FOR ITS MEASUREMENT. THE PAPER PRESENTS A LIST OF DESIRABLE VARIABLES THAT COULD IMPROVE THE MEASUREMENT OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
670	MANY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS RELY ON THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR ACCOUNTS OF POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. MANY, HOWEVER, SIMPLY EQUATE LAW WITH A STABLE GOVERNMENT CAPABLE OF ENFORCING THE RULES GENERATED BY A POLITICAL AUTHORITY. AS TWO DECADES OF LARGELY FAILED EFFORTS TO BUILD THE RULE OF LAW IN POOR AND TRANSITION COUNTRIES AND CONTINUING STRUGGLES TO BUILD INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER DEMONSTRATE, WE STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW LEGAL ORDER IS PRODUCED, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST. WE HERE CANVAS LITERATURE IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TO IDENTIFY THE THEMES AND GAPS IN THE EXISTING ACCOUNTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS LITERATURE HAS FAILED TO PRODUCE A MICROFOUNDATIONAL ACCOUNT OF THE PHENOMENON OF LEGAL ORDER. WE THEN DISCUSS OUR RECENT EFFORT TO DEVELOP THE MISSING MICROFOUNDATIONS OF LEGAL ORDER TO PROVIDE A BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW.
671	THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER WAS TO REVIEW THE EXTENT TO WHICH AUTOCRATIC TENDENCIES, SUPPRESSION OF CIVIL LIBERTIES, AND GOVERNMENT MISMANAGEMENT BETWEEN 1968 AND 1985 ERODED CONFIDENCE IN THE SIERRA LEONE GOVERNMENT AND LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THE COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR THAT BEGAN IN 1991. IT WAS ARGUED THAT NUMEROUS FACTORS WERE AT THE BASIS OF THE WAR, AND THAT CORRUPTION, AUTOCRATIC AND PATRIMONIAL RULE BY SIAKA STEVENS AND HIS RULING PARTY, THE ALL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, DIVIDED THE COUNTRY AND MADE IT RIPE FOR A TAKEOVER. THE CREATION OF AN ARMED PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION, THE INTERNAL SECURITY UNIT, DEMORALIZED AND ALIENATED BOTH THE REGULAR SIERRA LEONE POLICE FORCE AND THE SIERRA LEONE ARMY. THE CLIMATE OF CORRUPTION AND GREED-DELIBERATELY ENCOURAGED BY STEVENS HIMSELF UNDERMINED STATE LEGITIMACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. FURTHERMORE, THE CREATION OF A ONE-PARTY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT MADE THE SIAKA STEVENS REGIME ARROGANT AND INCAPABLE OF OBJECTIVELY EVALUATING GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND FORESEEING WEAKNESSES. THE GOVERNMENT BASED ITS SYSTEM OF GIVING REWARDS NOT ON MERIT, BUT ON LOYALTY TO THE PARTY, WHICH IN TIME BECAME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE STATE AND TWO PRIMARY ETHNIC GROUPS. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT BLOSSOMED AS THE GOVERNMENT SPENT LESS AND LESS ON EDUCATION. ALL THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EMERGENCE OF CIVIL WAR IN 1991.
672	HOW DOES THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (OHCHR) DISCHARGE ITS MANDATE OF PROMOTING AND PROTECTING THE EFFECTIVE ENJOYMENT BY ALL OF ALL CIVIL, CULTURAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY IN ARMED CONFLICTS AND OTHER SITUATIONS OF VIOLENCE? WHAT ARE ITS CONCRETE RESPONSIBILITIES, AND HOW DOES IT WORK TO GENERATE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW ON THE GROUND? THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OHCHR'S ACTIVITIES, AND POINT TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS WORK TO GENERATE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, IN PARTICULAR IN VIOLENT CONTEXTS. IT BEGINS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE UNIQUE MANDATE OF OHCHR AND SITUATES IT WITHIN THE BROADER UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS MACHINERY. IT THEN GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF OHCHR'S EXPERIENCE AND APPROACH IN BUILDING RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING IN ARMED CONFLICTS AND POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS, OUTLINING HOW THIS INFORMS OHCHR'S FIELD SETUP. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT OHCHR FACES IN THE DISCHARGE OF ITS MANDATE. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR MORE CONCERTED ACTION ON THE PART OF HUMAN RIGHTS/HUMANITARIAN PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND, DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN MANDATES AND CONSTITUENCIES.
673	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES SOME ASPECTS OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND RULE BY LAW, ELUCIDATING THOSE CONCEPTS BY FOCUSING ON THEIR ROLE IN POLITICAL SYSTEMS WITH A DOMINANT POLITICAL PARTY. AFTER CRITICIZING ACCOUNTS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW SERVES SOME INSTRUMENTAL PURPOSES OF THE DOMINANT PARTY, SUCH AS PROMOTING FOREIGN INVESTMENT, THE ARTICLE TURNS TO MORE NORMATIVE ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON AMERICAN LEGAL REALISM, IT ARGUES THAT STANDARD COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW SUCH AS COHERENCE AND INTELLIGIBILITY DO IMPOSE SOME NORMATIVE CONSTRAINTS ON DOMINANT PARTY BEHAVIOR. EXAMINING THE CONCEPT OF INTELLIGIBILITY IN MORE DETAIL, THOUGH, SHOWS THAT THOSE CONSTRAINTS ARE RELATIVELY WEAK, AND DEPEND IMPORTANTLY ON THE VIEWS PREVAILING IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION ABOUT WHAT A DECISION ACCORDING TO LAW IS.
674	UN PEACE OPERATIONS NEED A NEW PEACEBUILDING AGENDA THAT ACKNOWLEDGES BOTH THE TRANSBOUNDARY NATURE OF CONFLICT DRIVERS AND THE MULTIPOLAR NATURE OF THE GLOBAL ORDER. THIS MEANS CASTING ASIDE THE CURRENT STABILIZATION APPROACH, BUT ALSO ABANDONING THE PURSUIT OF LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING OF THE UNIPOLAR ERA. SUCH A CONFLICT TRANSFORMATION AGENDA WOULD REQUIRE UN PEACE OPERATIONS TO PRIORITIZE THE RULE OF LAW AND BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES, THUS CREATING THE POTENTIAL TO BE EMBRACED BY A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF MEMBER STATES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE BRING LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING CRITIQUES INTO A DISCUSSION WITH DEBATES ON THE NATURE OF THE GLOBAL ORDER. LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING CRITIQUES ARE ROOTED IN THE BOTTOM-UP PROBLEMATIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND SHOW WHAT KIND OF PEACEBUILDING IS DESIRABLE. CONVERSELY, THE DEBATES ON THE MULTIPOLAR NATURE OF THE GLOBAL ORDER EXPOSE THE TOP-DOWN CONSTRAINTS AS TO WHAT KIND OF PEACEBUILDING IS FEASIBLE.
675	THE GUARANTEE OF HABEAS CORPUS UNFOLDS, WITH ALL HUMILITY, REASONS FOR THE PERSISTENT EXPANSION OF FREEDOM OR FOR ITS CONTINUOUS REINFORCEMENT. ITS LOW PROFILE, HOWEVER, HAS BEING CONFUSED WITH INDIFFERENCE BY HIS COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE OF THE SCIENCE OF LAW; THIS IS EXPLAINED, ON THE ONE HAND, DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD BELIEF THAT ITS EXPRESS RECOGNITION AS POSITIVE LAW - IN THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF LAW STANDARDS- IS A SUFFICIENT SOLUTION TO JEOPARDIZING OR DIRECT ATTACKS TO THE PERSONAL AUTONOMY IN HANDS OF THE STATE AND, IN THE OTHER HAND, LOGICALLY ANCHORED IN THE PRECEDING GROUNDS, IN A SORT OF CONTEMPORARY DISLOCATION IN FRONT OF A THEORETICAL POINT OF CONTENTION (AND IN UNUSED ABUSE) OF POLITICAL POWER, TO WHICH, HOWEVER, IS REQUIRED SOLUTIONS WITH MORE FACTUAL INTERVENTION (AND LESS LIMITATION) IN SOCIAL RELATIONS, THOUGH NECESSARILY SUITABLE TO THE PREVIOUS ORDER. IT CORRESPONDS TO EXPOSE THE DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS FEET ON OWN KEYS TO THE SCIENCE OF LAW, WITHOUT PUTTING ASIDE THE PRAGMATIC DUAL METHOD THAT WILL BE APPLIED ON THE TOUR THAT FOLLOWS, TO WHICH WE INVITE.
676	STRENGTHENING THE 'RULE OF LAW' (ROL) HAS EMERGED AS A KEY REQUIREMENT IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES. NO LONGER SIMPLY A PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAL, ROL NOW EXISTS AS A TANGIBLE SET OF POLICIES CREATED AND IMPLEMENTED BY INTERNATIONAL ACTORS, TO WHICH CONFLICT-AFFECTED STATES ARE EXPECTED TO CONFORM. MASKED IN THE NEUTRAL, APOLITICAL RHETORIC OF BLIND AND OBJECTIVE JUSTICE, ROL PROGRAMMING IS IN FACT A POLITICAL TOOL WITHIN THE LARGER LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING PROJECT. ITS EMPLOYMENT AS SUCH MUTES ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CONSTRUCTING A POSITIVE PEACE AS IT OFTEN CREATES NEW SOCIO-POLITICAL TENSIONS AND DISTORTS ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES. AN ANALYSIS OF REFORMS IN KOSOVO UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS ADMINISTRATION ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL FOR LIBERAL ROL REFORMS TO INCREASE INSECURITY IN THE SHORT TERM AND THREATEN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PEACEBUILDING REFORMS IN THE LONG TERM. INSTRUMENTAL USE OF ROL PROGRAMMING THUS PROVIDES FURTHER EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESSES AND CONTRADICTIONS WITHIN THE POLITICISED LIBERAL PEACEBUILDING PROJECT, NECESSITATING RECONSIDERATION OF ITS ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT TRANSFORMATIONS.
677	AFTER THE 52/2007 ACT (COMMONLY KNOWN AS "HISTORICAL MEMORY ACT"), VICTIMS OF FRANCOIST REPRESSION GO TO THE JUDICIARY TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS TO TRUTH, JUSTICE AND REPARATION GUARANTEED. IN A FEBRUARY 2012 DECISION, THE SUPREME COURT REJECTED THE POSSIBILITY TO PROSECUTE IN SPANISH COURTS THE VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS OCCURRED DURING FRANCO DICTATORSHIP. DESPITE THIS DECISION, THERE ARE LEGAL WAYS TO INVOLVE JUDGES IN THE GUARANTEE OF VICTIMS' RIGHT TO REPARATION. A RIGHT NOT PROTECTED BY PUBLIC POLICIES, AS THE HISTORICAL MEMORY ACT REQUIRES. THIS FAILURE TO ACT OBLIGES JUDGES TO GUARANTEE THE RULE OF LAW ON ISSUES RELATED WITH THE RIGHT OF REPARATION: THE EXHUMATION OF VICTIMS OF ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES AND THE REMOVAL OF SYMBOLS EXALTING THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR AND THE FRANCO REGIME.
678	THIS PAPER EXAMINES HOW ATTITUDES TOWARD VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN (VAW)-IN TERMS OF JUSTIFICATION-INFLUENCE THE BEHAVIORAL INTENTIONS OF AFGHAN POLICE OFFICERS WHEN DEALING WITH A CASE OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV). AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH 108 AFGHAN POLICE OFFICERS WHO TOOK PART IN A TRAINING COURSE AT THE NATO TRAINING MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN (NTM-A) BASES IN HERAT AND KANDAHAR. PARTICIPANTS READ AN EXTRACT OF A POLICE INTERVENTION FOR AN IPV CASE. THEY WERE FACED WITH HONOR-RELATED ATTITUDES AND POSSIBLE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN TO HELP VICTIMS AND ARREST PERPETRATORS. IN THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION, IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE PROVIDED TO POLICE OFFICERS, THERE WAS REFERENCE TO THE VICTIM ADMITTING TO AN AFFAIR WITH ANOTHER MAN. NO SUCH REFERENCE WAS PRESENT IN THE CONTROL CONDITION. RESULTS SHOWED THAT ADMITTING AN INFIDELITY PRODUCED MORE LENIENT ATTITUDES TOWARD THE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE WOMAN, WHICH IN TURN REDUCED POLICE OFFICERS' INTENTION TO INTERVENE BY ARRESTING THE MAN AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE VICTIM. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE SO-CALLED CULTURE OF (MASCULINE) HONOR AND THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS IMPLICATIONS.
679	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE MANNER IN WHICH, FACED WITH THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS GENERATED BY THE 2017-2019 NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE REFORMS, THE ROMANIAN JUDICIAL ASSOCIATIONS, ORGANIZED AS NGOS, HAVE FULFILLED THEIR DECLARED PURPOSE OF SAFEGUARDING JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. BY RELYING ON EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION TACTICS-INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL NETWORKING AND LOBBYING OR INFORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH HIGH-LEVEL EU REPRESENTATIVES-COUPLED WITH A STRATEGIC USE OF PRELIMINARY REFERENCES, THEY HAVE SHED LIGHT ON SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE ELEMENTS OF THE ROMANIAN CONTEXT, GARNERING BOTH INTERNAL AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT IN THE PROCESS. IN PARTICULAR, BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CJEU'S INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL JUDICIAL SYSTEMS, THE ROMANIAN JUDICIAL ASSOCIATIONS HAVE MANAGED TO DESIGN STRATEGIES CAPABLE OF TRIGGERING PRELIMINARY RULINGS ON THE MOST HEATED AND POLITICALLY CHARGED QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE JUDICIARY. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE SPECIFIC FEATURES AND INFORMAL ELEMENTS OF SUCH STRATEGIES.
680	THE CENTRAL-LOCAL STRUCTURE IS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FOR BOTH CHINA'S CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND PARTY-STATE STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE PAYS GREAT ATTENTION TO ITS STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK. THIS PAPER TAKES A UNIQUE APPROACH TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE FUNDS, AN INCREASINGLY FREQUENTLY USED METHOD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT NATIONAL PROJECTS LIKE MADE IN CHINA 2025. THE PROJECT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE SEVERAL CONTROVERSIES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IN THEIR ONGOING TRADE CONFRONTATION. BUILT UPON AN ANALYSIS OF PARADIGMS IN CENTRAL-LOCAL RELATIONS, THIS PAPER FURTHER INVESTIGATES THE RULE OF LAW MOVEMENT AT THE LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AN OFTEN IGNORED AND UNDER-DISCUSSED ASPECT OF CHINA'S CENTRAL-LOCAL STRUCTURE. THE TENTATIVE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE USE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE FUNDS FACILITATES LOCAL COMPETITION AND PROMOTES THE RULE OF LAW.
681	DESPITE AN INTRACTABLE JUDICIARY, THERE IS WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS WITHIN THE LEGAL ACADEMY THAT JURY NULLIFICATION IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS PROPOSITION IS MOST STRONGLY TESTED BY "SUBSTANTIVE NULLIFICATIONS," WHERE A JURY NULLIFIES SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DISAGREES WITH THE LAW ITSELF. WHILE SOME SUBSTANTIVE NULLIFICATIONS CAN COMPORT WITH THE RULE OF LAW, MOST COMMENTATORS' WHOLESALE ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRACTICE IS NOT JUSTIFIED. THEY ERR BY IGNORING THE NONSUBSTANTIVE, PROCEDURAL NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN FAVOR OF ONE DETERMINED BY SUBSTANTIVE " JUSTICE," AND ALSO BY TAKING A NAIVELY UNDIFFERENTIATED VIEW OF A "COMMUNITY'S" MORALITY (EVEN THOUGH JURISDICTIONAL AND VICINAGE MORALITY CAN DIVERGE). IN DOING SO, A HEALTHY VISION OF ANTITYRANNICAL NULLIFICATIONS IS PRESENTED, BUT THIS LEAVES OUT MANY PROBLEMATIC CASES. ONCE THESE ERRORS ARE RECTIFIED, A MORE NUANCED PICTURE EMERGES, AND IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT LOCALISM WILL OFTEN DISRUPT THE CONGRUENCE FEATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
682	POST-CONFLICT GOVERNANCE POSES PARTICULAR CHALLENGES TO GOVERNMENTS AND FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. WE FOCUS ON THE QUESTION OF HOW - AND WHETHER - THE RULE OF LAW IS RECONSTITUTED IN THE WAKE OF CIVIL CONFLICT. WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT THE STATE OF THE RULE OF LAW PRIOR TO AND DURING A CONFLICT SUBSTANTIALLY PREDICTS THE RECONSTITUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW POST CONFLICT. WE FURTHER FIND THAT FOREIGN INTERVENTION HAS A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE RULE OF LAW POST CONFLICT AND THAT WARS WHICH END WITH A TRUTH OR SETTLEMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER RULE OF LAW POST CONFLICT THAN THOSE RESOLVED THROUGH VICTORIES BY EITHER GOVERNMENT OR REBEL FORCES.
683	THE ARTICLE ANALYZES SUCH NEW SOURCES OF LAW AS NORMATIVE LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND NORM-ORIENTING ACTS OF COURTS THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PRESENCE OF OTHER NEW SOURCES OF LAW, INCLUDING LEGAL DOCTRINE, IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS DENIED. NORMATIVE LEGAL AGREEMENTS ARE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE FEDERAL SPHERE, AGREEMENTS ON THE TRANSFER OF POWERS OR JOINT ACTIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING MULTILEVEL ONES, AS WELL AS BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS, LABOR AGREEMENTS. AT PRESENT, THE LAW HAS PRACTICALLY NO CLEAR RULES REGARDING THE CONTENT, CONDITIONS OF CONCLUSION AND CONSEQUENCES OF NON-FULFILLMENT OF NORMATIVE AGREEMENTS. THEREFORE, IT IS PROPOSED TO USE THE NORMATIVE LEGAL ACT FOR LEGAL REGULATION IN PUBLIC LAW, SINCE THIS FORM IMPLIES CLEARER WAYS TO ENSURE THE RULE OF LAW. A TENDENCY TOWARDS A REDUCTION IN CONTRACTUAL REGULATION IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS ALSO OBSERVED. NORM-ORIENTING ACTS OF COURTS ARE ACTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, OFFERING INTERPRETATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS, RECOGNIZING LEGAL NORMS AS CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, ACTS OF OTHER HIGHER COURTS GENERALIZING THE PRACTICE, DECISIONS OF HIGHER AND OTHER COURTS THAT RECOGNIZE REGULATORY ACTS INVALID DUE TO THEIR CONTRADICTION TO ACTS OF GREAT LEGAL FORCE. THE MANIFESTATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN RELATION TO NORM-ORIENTING ACTS OF THE COURTS IS SPECIFIC: THE COURT IN SUCH CASES ACTUALLY INTERVENES IN THE PREROGATIVE OF THE LAWMAKER. HOWEVER, IT IS PROPOSED TO CONSIDER THAT THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO THE LEVELING OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT, ON THE CONTRARY, INCREASES ITS IMPORTANCE, SINCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION THEREBY PROTECTS THE CONSTITUTIONALISM OF THE CONTENT OF LAWS, COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION AND ARBITRATION COURTS, WHEN RECOGNIZING NORMATIVE ACTS AS INVALID, CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY, AND GENERALIZATIONS OF THE PRACTICE OF HIGHER COURTS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO UNIFORMLY UNDERSTAND AND APPLY THE NORMS OF LAW CONTAINED IN THE LAW. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEGAL POSITIONS OF THE COURTS AND THE NORMS OF LAWS. IN ADDITION TO THE NEGATIVE COMPONENT, IT IS PROPOSED TO PERCEIVE A POSITIVE COMPONENT IN THIS FACT: THE ABILITY OF SUCH DISCREPANCIES TO INFLUENCE THE SEARCH FOR OPTIMAL LEGAL REGULATION THROUGH THE PRISM OF INTERACTION BETWEEN VARIOUS BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE NEED IS IDENTIFIED FOR A MORE DETAILED DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOCTRINE OF "SELF-RESTRAINT" OF THE COURTS WHEN THEY INTERVENE IN THE LEGISLATIVE SPHERE.
684	THE TERM 'INTERNAL SECURITY ACT' IS OFTEN GIVEN TO A PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN REGULATIONS THAT ENABLE THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT OF A JURISDICTION TO PRESERVE THE INTERNAL SECURITY OF THE NATION. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, IT AUTHORISES THE GOVERNMENT TO ARREST AND DETAIN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT TRIAL. THE MALAYSIAN INTERNAL SECURITY ACT (ISA) 1960 WAS ORIGINALLY ENACTED BY THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT IN 1960 UNDER ARTICLE 149 OF THE MALAYSIAN CONSTITUTION. HOWEVER, THERE WERE NUMEROUS CONCERNS RAISED AS TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ACT AT VARIOUS LEVELS OVER THE YEARS AND THIS LED TO IT BEING REPEALED. ON 15 SEPTEMBER 2011, ISA 1960 WAS REPEALED AND REPLACED BY THE SECURITY OFFENCES (SPECIAL MEASURES) ACT 2012. SOSMA 2012 WAS ENACTED IN ANSWER TO THE CRITICISM OF THE ISA 1960 AND IT DOES SHOW SOME POSITIVE CHANGES. HOWEVER, THE DEBATE AS TO THE CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO ISA HAS NOT BEEN LAID TO REST. IT IS ADVOCATED AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY MOST PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT THE NATION'S EMPHASIS ON DOMESTIC STABILITY CANNOT BE SAID TO NEGATE THE PRESENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW (ROL). THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ANALYSE THE RELATIVELY INTRIGUING NEW ACT, THE SECURITY OFFENCES (SPECIAL MESAURES) ACT 2012 WITH THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER IT UPHOLDS THE PRINCIPLES DEEMED NECESSARY UNDER THE ROL.
685	THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CURRENT LEVEL OF LEGAL PROTECTION OF CLIMATE MIGRANTS IN INTERNATIONAL AND EU LAW AND THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT THE PRESENT APPROACH MIGHT HAVE ON THE RULE OF LAW. IT FIRST ANALYSES WHETHER THE CURRENT BINDING INSTRUMENTS OF REFUGEE AND CLIMATE CHANGE LAW OFFER ANY PROTECTION FOR CLIMATE MIGRANTS AND IDENTIFIES A LEGAL GAP IN THIS REGARD. IT THEN BRIEFLY ADDRESSES THE PROGRESS MADE BY RECENTLY ADOPTED SOFT LAW INSTRUMENTS AND THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE DECISION IN THE TEITIOTA CASE, AT THE SAME TIME POINTING OUT THAT THE LATTER DECISION HAS SET CRITERIA WHICH MIGHT JEOPARDISE THE REALISATION OF THE NON-REFOULEMENT RIGHT WHICH IT AIMS TO GUARANTEE. THE PAPER THEN ANALYSES THE LITERATURE ON THE LINK OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MIGRATION, USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR, THE RISE OF ANTI-IMMIGRATION POPULISM WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY OCCURRED, AS WELL AS THE THREAT THAT SUCH MOVEMENTS MIGHT POSE FOR THE RULE OF LAW THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE PLANNED AND SYSTEMATIC RESPONSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CLIMATE MIGRATION AND CONTINUED GOOD REGIONAL AND BILATERAL PRACTICES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PREVENT SUDDEN SPIKES IN MASS MIGRATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO ANTI-IMMIGRATION POPULIST MOVEMENTS.
686	TRANSPOSING RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES FROM THE NATIONAL TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, IN PARTICULAR TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, STILL RAISES QUESTIONS AND CAN BE PROBLEMATIC. HOWEVER, RULE OF LAW CONSIDERATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE WHEN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS EXERCISE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY AND MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT STATES AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO), UNLIKE OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO INTERNATIONAL ACUTE EMERGENCIES IN THE FORM OF DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND PANDEMICS. ITS MAIN NORMATIVE TOOL IS THE 2005 INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (IHR), THAT REPRESENT A BREAKTHROUGH FROM PAST INSTRUMENTS BUT ALSO RAISE QUESTIONS AND CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ANALYZED FROM A RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE. THIS APPROACH APPLIES IN PARTICULAR TO AMBIGUITIES IN IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE IHR AFFECTING THEIR RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS; LACK OF CLARITY FOR PROCESSES LEADING TO SENSITIVE EXECUTIVE DECISIONS; THE ABSENCE OF COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT MECHANISMS RESULTING IN LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR STATES PARTIES; AND AN INADEQUATE INCLUSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES. THE ANALYSIS IS EXTENDED BEYOND WHO'S FUNCTIONS, TO THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE ORGANIZATION'S GOVERNANCE AS WELL AS ITS INTERNAL MANAGEMENT.
687	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GUOMINDANG (GMD) AND THE COURTS BY FOCUSING ON THE 1929 CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE SUZHOU BAPTIST SCHOOLS AND THE LOCAL GMD PARTY APPARATUS. THE GMD REGIME SUPPORTED THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE BY THE PARTY. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, THE GMD'S RISE WAS OFTEN STYMIED BY THE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY WHOSE JUDGMENTS WERE BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE LOCAL PARTY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE LOCAL COURT IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE GMD REGIME, BUT IT DID STEADILY ALTER STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONSHIPS, AS IT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE LOCAL COURT'S COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. FOR INSTANCE, THE DISTRICT COURT IN SUZHOU ACTIVELY DEFENDED THE PRINCIPLE OF RULE BY THE PARTY IN CONFLICTS BETWEEN BAPTIST SCHOOLS AND THE LOCAL PARTY BECAUSE THE GMD HAD MADE THAT PRINCIPLE THE LAW OF THE LAND.
688	THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE THEORY THAT NATIONAL COURTS CAN ACT AS AGENTS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, I.E. THE IDEA THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, NATIONAL COURTS MAY COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF INTERNATIONAL MECHANISMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURE THAT THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW. THIS THEORY IS TESTED AGAINST A PARADIGMATIC CASE STUDY FROM THE FIELD OF MIGRATION, THE DICIOTTI AFFAIR, WHICH SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW VIOLATIONS CAUSED BY GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES OF MIGRATION CONTAINMENT. IN THIS INCIDENT, MIGRANTS RESCUED AT SEA BY AN ITALIAN COAST GUARD SHIP WERE CONFINED ONBOARD FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS IN APPARENT VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STANDARDS. THE BREACHES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE INCIDENT WERE AT THE CENTER OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CASES BEFORE THE ITALIAN COURTS. EVEN THOUGH, PRIMA FACIE, THE RESPONSE OF THE ITALIAN JUDICIARY WOULD APPEAR TO BE A TEXTBOOK CONFIRMATION OF THE VIEW OF NATIONAL COURTS AS GUARDIANS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE DICIOTTI AFFAIR ALSO SUGGESTS THAT CAUTION IS REQUIRED AS REGARDS THE ACTUAL POWERS OF NATIONAL COURTS TO COMPEL STATE AUTHORITIES TO RESPECT INTERNATIONAL LAW.
689	ON FEBRUARY 16, THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION DISMISSED THE APPEALS OF HUNGARY AND POLAND REQUESTING THE ANNULMENT OF REGULATION 2020/2092 ON A GENERAL REGIME OF CONDITIONALITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE UNION BUDGET, CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN ADEQUATE LEGAL BASIS AND DID NOT VIOLATE THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, EQUAL TREATMENT BETWEEN MEMBER STATES OR THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPORTIONALITY, AMONG OTHERS. BY RULING FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM, THE CJ HAS CLARIFIED THE INTERPRETIVE PARAMETERS ON THE APPLICATION OF REGULATION 2020/2092 AND HAS GIVEN FREE REIN TO THE POSSIBLE ACTIVATION OF THIS INSTRUMENT CONFIGURED TO PROTECT THE BUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PROMOTE THE OBSERVANCE AND RESPECT BY ITS MEMBER STATES OF THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW ENSHRINED IN ART. 2 TUE.
690	THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS EAGERLY PROMOTING THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CONFLICT STATES SUCH AS TIMOR-LESTE IN THE BELIEF THAT IT WILL LEAD TO POLITICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY. TO ATTRACT INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY, TIMORESE LEADERS ARE ALSO KEEN TO BE SEEN TO BE INVOKING THE RULE OF LAW ALTHOUGH THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY UNDERSTAND AND USE THE CONCEPT OFTEN DIVERGES FROM DOMINANT WESTERN UNDERSTANDINGS. THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW ASSUMES THAT THE STATE ENJOYS A MONOPOLY OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RESONANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN TIMOR-LESTE IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT CUSTOMARY LAW IS THE TYPE OF LAW WITH WHICH PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE FIRST AND FREQUENT CONTACT AS THE STATE HAS LITTLE REACH BEYOND THE CAPITAL. IT CONCLUDES BY RECOMMENDING THAT ALL ACTORS PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CONFLICT STATES NEED TO EQUIP THEMSELVES WITH A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE POPULATION ENGAGES WITH LEGAL NORMS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW.
691	IN THE EU, POLITICAL CRISES OFTEN SERVE AS CATALYSTS FOR POLICYMAKING AND 'FAILING FORWARD'. YET AS A BREAKDOWN OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS SWEPT SOME MEMBER STATES, EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO REACT. WE ARGUE THAT THIS OUTCOME IS PARTLY TIED TO HOW POLITICAL ELITES STRATEGICALLY MOBILIZE RHETORIC TO LEGITIMATE STASIS DURING CRISES. BUILDING ON THEORIES OF RHETORICAL ACTION AND DISCURSIVE INSTITUTIONALISM, WE RECTIFY THEIR BIAS FOR CHANGE AND DRAW ON ALBERT HIRSCHMAN'S WORK TO THEORIZE 'RHETORICS OF INACTION': A COORDINATIVE DISCOURSE WIELDED BY NATIONAL AND SUPRANATIONAL ACTORS TO RECONCILE DIVERGENT PREFERENCES AND JUSTIFY STASIS BY APPEALING TO THE VERY POLICIES AND VALUES THREATENED BY CRISIS. WE SPECIFY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH RHETORICS OF INACTION ARE MOST LIKELY TO PERVADE EU POLICYMAKING AND ILLUSTRATE THE THEORY'S EXPLANATORY PURCHASE IN A CASE STUDY OF THE EU'S (NON-)RESPONSES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL BREAKDOWNS OF HUNGARY AND POLAND. BY TRACING THE DISCURSIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EU AND GOVERNMENT POLICYMAKERS, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT POPULIST AND PARTISAN AFFRONTS ON THE EU CONCEAL FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED AND OBSTRUCTIVE ARGUMENTATIVE STRATEGIES BEHIND-THE-SCENES. WE CONCLUDE THAT RHETORICAL POLITICS ARE CENTRAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE EU'S FAILURE TO RESPOND TO CRISES AND ELABORATE AVENUES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.
692	WHY DID MARTIN KRYGIER BECOME A RULE OF LAW GUY? THIS INTRODUCTION TO A SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE HAGUE JOURNAL ON THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH CONSISTS OF 33 SHORT ESSAYS CELEBRATING KRYGIER AS A COLLEAGUE, MENTOR AND FRIEND, DISCUSSES SOME OF THE FACTORS WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO DEVELOP A DISTINCT AND INFLUENTIAL BODY OF WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES: THE RULE OF LAW REVIVAL, ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE; HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH PHILIP SELZNICK; AND HIS DIALOGUE WITH OTHER PROMINENT THEORISTS, INCLUDING GIANLUIGI PALOMBELLA AND JEREMY WALDRON. THE INTRODUCTION GIVES A SENSE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF KRYGIER'S PERSONAL BACKGROUND AND HISTORY, AND IT ALSO DISCUSSES SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES OF HIS THEORY, AND HOW THESE HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST DECADES.
693	PLATO'S IDEA OF THE SECOND-BEST STATE IS THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT IS CONSIDERED AS A REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILOSOPHER KING, DIFFERING FORMALLY FROM IT ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF GENERAL RULES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ELABORATE AN ARTICULATION OF BOTH PROPOSALS AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN PLATO'S THOUGHT. THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IT AND THE MODERN THEORIES OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE ASSESSED. PLATO CONCEIVES THE RULE OF LAW AS A REMEDY DIRECTED TO AVOID TYRANNY, IN WHICH THE IDEA OF GENERALITY, CHARACTERISTICALLY ASSOCIATED TO THE RULE OF LAW. THE LAW THAT RULES THE POLIS IS A REASONED THOUGHT ACCEPTED BY THE CITIZENSHIP, DIRECTED TO AVOID THE RULING OF THE WILL OF THE TYRANT.
694	THE ARTICLE STUDIES THE ISSUES OF ENSURING THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE" AT THE STAGE OF REVIEWING JUDICIAL ACTS HAVING COME INTO FORCE DUE TO THE JUDGEMENT (ALTERATION) MADE BY A HIGHER COURT INTO THE PRACTICE OF APPLYING THE NORMS OF THE APPLICABLE LEGISLATION. THE PROCEDURAL MECHANISM OF OVERCOMING THE LEGAL FORCE OF JUDICIAL ACTS DUE TO THIS POSITION OF HIGHER COURTS IS CRITICIZED BY THE AUTHOR BECAUSE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY WITH THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE, BASED ON ITS INTEGRAL ELEMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL JUDGEMENT REQUIRING THE OBSERVATION OF THE RES JUDICATA PRINCIPLE. RES JUDICATA PRESUPPOSES THE CONCLUSIVENESS OF THE FINAL JUDICIAL ACT, I.E. THE ACT NOT SUBJECT TO A SEPARATE APPEAL. THE CONCLUSIVENESS OF THE JUDICIAL FACT SUPPOSES THE BAN ON THE REVIEW OF THE FINAL JUDICIAL ACT BY ORDINARY CAUSES; NECESSITY TO REVIEW IT WITHIN THE STRICTLY DETERMINED PERIODS AND ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES ONLY IF JUDICIAL MISTAKES HAVE BEEN REVEALED WHICH INFLUENCED THE DECISION. AT THE SAME TIME THE MECHANISM OF REVIEWING JUDICIAL ACTS ANALYZED BY THE AUTHOR SUPPOSES THE CANCELLATION OF THE FINAL JUDICIAL ACTS ON THIS USUAL CIRCUMSTANCE DUE TO SUCH A CAUSE AS THE BREACH OF CONSISTENCY IN THE VIEWS OF THE CONTENT OF PRESCRIPTIVE TEXTS. THE CANCELLATION OF JUDICIAL ACTS DURING THEIR REVIEW DUE TO NEW CIRCUMSTANCES SUBJECT TO THE LEGAL POSITION OF HIGHER COURTS IS ESSENTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE REVERSAL OF JUDICIAL ACTS UNDER POINT 1 PART/ ARTICLE 304 OF RF ARBITRATION PROCEDURAL CODE AND POINT 3 OF ARTICLE 391.9 OF RF CIVIL PROCEDURAL CODE (VIOLATION BY COURTS (ARBITRATION COURTS) IN TERMS OF CONSISTENCY IN INTERPRETING AND APPLYING LEGAL NORMS. ON THE BASIS OF CASE PRACTICE OF THE EC HR RECOGNIZING THE REVERSAL OF JUDICIAL ACTS WHICH HAVE ENTERED INTO FORCE INCLUDING DURING THE PROCEDURE OF JUDICIAL ACT REVIEW ON NEW OR RECENTLY REVEALED CIRCUMSTANCES, DUE TO THEIR INCONSISTENCY WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF THE NORMS OF LAW BY HIGHER COURTS AN INTOLERABLE DIGRESSION FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY AND THE INTERVENTION IN THE PRIVATE PROPERTY LAW, THE NORMS OF APPLICABLE RUSSIAN PROCEDURAL LEGISLATION REGULATING THE REVIEW OF THE CASE DUE TO THE POSITION OF A HIGHER COURT, IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OF JUDICIAL PRACTICE, THE AUTHOR ARRIVES AT A CONCLUSION THAT THE CANCELLATION OF THE FINAL JUDICIAL ACTS DELIVERED ON THE CASES PURSUANT TO CIVIL -LAW RELATIONS DUE TO THE POSITION OF A HIGHER COURT CONTRADICTS THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. AS TO THE CASES ON PUBLIC -LAW RELATIONS THE CANCELATION OF THE JUDICIAL ACTS HAVING COME INTO FORCE DUE TO A NEW POSITION OF A HIGHER COURT IS ALLOWED ONLY IF THE CONDITIONS OF CITIZENS AND ASSOCIATIONS DISPUTING WITH THE STATE IMPROVE.
695	DESPITE EXTENSIVE DEBATE, ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW REMAIN STRIKINGLY VAGUE AND IMPRECISE. THIS PAPER BEGINS THE TASK OF REMEDYING THIS SITUATION THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANALYTICALLY RIGOROUS THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW. FIRST, IT OFFERS A PRELIMINARY SKETCH OF A CONCEPT OF LAW; SECOND, IT SHOWS HOW THE PRINCIPLES TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE INTRINSICALLY CONNECTED WITH THIS CONCEPT OF LAW; AND THIRD, IT SHOWS HOW THESE PRINCIPLES PLACE MEANINGFUL RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT STATES CAN AND CANNOT DO. FURTHER COMPONENTS OF THE OVERALL PROJECT ARE GESTURED TOWARD IN THE PAPER'S CONCLUSION. APART FROM ADVANCING THE BROADER GOAL OF DEVELOPING A COMPLETE THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW, A PAPER OF EVEN THIS LIMITED SCOPE WILL BE HELPFUL IN IMPOSING SOME MUCH-NEEDED CONCEPTUAL DISCIPLINE OVER THE RULE OF LAW DEBATE.
696	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW 'EVERYDAY' LAWYERS UNDERTAKING ROUTINE CRIMINAL DEFENCE CASES NAVIGATE AN AUTHORITARIAN LEGAL SYSTEM. BASED ON ORIGINAL FIELDWORK IN THE 'DISCIPLINED DEMOCRACY' OF MYANMAR, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW HEGEMONIC STATE POWER AND A FUNCTIONAL ABSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE CREATED A CULTURE OF PASSIVITY AMONG ORDINARY PRACTITIONERS. 'EVERYDAY' LAWYERS ARE NEVERTHELESS ABLE TO UPHOLD THEIR CLIENTS' DIGNITY BY PRACTICAL AND MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN EXPERIENCE - AND IN SO DOING, SUBTLY RESIST, EVADE OR DISRUPT STATE POWER. THE ARTICLE DRAWS UPON THE LITERATURE ON THE SOCIOLOGY OF LAWYERING AND RESISTANCE, ARGUING FOR A MULTILAYERED UNDERSTANDING OF DIGNITY GOING BEYOND LAWYERS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEIR CLIENTS' LEGAL AUTONOMY. FOCUSING ON DIGNITY PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVE TO THE OTHERWISE OFTEN ALL-CONSUMING RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE. IN AUTHORITARIAN LEGAL SYSTEMS, ENHANCING THEIR CLIENTS' DIGNITY BEYOND LEGAL AUTONOMY MAY BE THE ONLY MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION THAT 'EVERYDAY' LAWYERS CAN MAKE.
697	THIS ARTICLE USES CONSTITUTIONAL DISCOURSES ON THE LEGALITY OF SECURITY CERTIFICATES TO SHED LIGHT ON DARKER, NEGLECTED CORNERS OF THE SECURITY AND MIGRATION NEXUS IN CANADA. I EXPLORE HOW PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES USED IN THE CERTIFICATE REGIME HAVE EVOLVED AND MIGRATED TO ANALOGOUS ADJUDICATIVE AND DISCRETIONARY DECISION-MAKING CONTEXTS. I ARGUE, ON THE ONE HAND, THAT THE EXECUTIVE'S ABILITY TO LABEL PERSONS SECURITY RISKS HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO MEANINGFUL CONSTRAINTS IN THE CERTIFICATE REGIME AND OTHER FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT ADJUDICATIVE PROCEEDINGS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ABILITY OF DISCRETIONARY DECISION MAKERS TO DEPORT INDIVIDUALS WHO POSE DE JURE SECURITY RISKS TO FACE TORTURE OR SIMILAR ABUSES REMAINS EFFECTIVELY UNCONSTRAINED-SO MUCH SO THAT IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT CANADA HAS COMPLIED WITH SURESH. IF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA TAKES ITS OWN RATIONALE IN THE CERTIFICATE TRILOGY SERIOUSLY, IT MUST EITHER REVISE ITS POSITION IN SURESH OR ENCOURAGE THE EXTENSION OF THE PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES USED IN THE CERTIFICATE REGIME TO THE ENTIRE SECURITY AND MIGRATION NEXUS, INCLUDING THE REMOVAL PROCESS.
698	TO PLACE THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE INTO PERSPECTIVE, I FIRST PRESENT THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR AMERICA'S TRADITIONAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED BY THE THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, ESPECIALLY PROMOTED BY EARLY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SCHOLARS. I THEN PRESENT THE PREVALENT SCHOLARLY VIEWPOINT THAT WE LIVE IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE WHERE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS EXERCISE NOT ONLY ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS, BUT LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL POWERS AS WELL BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS IRRESPONSIBLY DELEGATED AWAY VAST LEGISLATIVE POWERS TO AGENCY ADMINISTRATORS, WHILE THE COURTS HAVE PROVIDED SCANT REVIEW BY DEFERRING TOO READILY TO ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERTISE. TO THESE SCHOLARS, THIS HAS UNDERMINED OUR CHECKS AND BALANCE SYSTEM AND VIOLATED THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE MERIT TO THIS POSITION, FOR THE SAKE OF PROVIDING SOME BALANCE, I PRESENT A RATHER POLEMICAL, OPPOSING ARGUMENT. I HOLD THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE NOTION DISTORTS THE TRUE GOVERNING SYSTEM IN AMERICA BECAUSE CONGRESS, THE COURTS, AND THE PRESIDENT ARE STILL VIABLE PLAYERS THAT HAVE AND CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE, IF NECESSARY, SUFFICIENT CHECKS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. I PROVIDE THE REASONS WHY. I CONCLUDE BY QUESTIONING WHETHER WE EVEN HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, BUT EVEN IF SO, I OFFER EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY SANCTIONED, POLITICALLY LEGITIMATE, UPHOLDS THE RULE OF LAW, AND ACTUALLY PERFORMS BETTER THAN OUR TRADITIONAL THREE GOVERNMENTAL BRANCHES.
699	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE PROBLEM OF TORTURE IN MEXICO AND ITS IMPACT ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE STATE AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. DESPITE THE NORMATIVE ADVANCES IN THE CONFIGURATION OF THE NOTION OF TORTURE, THERE ARE PROBLEMS OF EFFECTIVENESS IN THE MECHANISMS WITH WHICH THE STATE OPERATES TO COMPLY WITH ITS OBLIGATION OF DUE DILIGENCE IN THE PREVENTION, INVESTIGATION, REGISTRATION AND PROSECUTION OF TORTURE CASES. THE AUTHOR EMPHASIZES THAT TORTURE IS A SYMPTOM OF THE WEAKNESS OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH PRODUCES A SOCIAL DELEGITIMIZATION DUE TO THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF SOCIETY'S EXPECTATIONS IN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS RELATED TO A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY, DISCRIMINATION AND INEQUALITY, WHICH DEMANDS EFFECTIVE AND FAIR POLICIES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THEREFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO ADVANCE IN THE JUSTICIABILITY, PREVENTION, INVESTIGATION, ERADICATION, PROTECTION, REPARATION AND PUNISHMENT OF ACTS OF TORTURE.
700	THE RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS BREAKS DOWN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN DOMESTIC LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS WELL AS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW IN DOMESTIC AFFAIRS AND THAT IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, PROVIDING A BRIDGE FOR CHINA TO BUILD LAW-BASED GOVERNANCE AND TO REFORM THE GLOBAL GOVERNANCE SYSTEM FOR THE NEW ERA. THE EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF DOMESTIC LAW CAN LEAD TO LEGAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN NATIONS AND CONFLICTS BETWEEN DOMESTIC LAW AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. THE PRINCIPLE OF EXTRATERRITORIALLY APPLYING DOMESTIC LAW SHOULD BE BASED ON NOT VIOLATING THE PROHIBITIVE PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RESOLVING LEGAL CONFLICTS THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL TREATIES OR NEGOTIATIONS. IN THE SYSTEMATIC UNDERTAKING OF TAKING A COORDINATED APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINESE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN-RELATED AFFAIRS, THE BUILDING OF CHINA'S SYSTEM OF EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION OF DOMESTIC LAW SHOULD BE ACCELERATED UNDER THE UNIFIED LEADERSHIP BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA, WITH LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES PERFORMING THEIR RESPECTIVE DUTIES. THIS BUILDING SHOULD BE BASED ON MULTILATERALISM, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND WITH THE BOTTOM LINE OF NOT VIOLATING THE PROHIBITIVE PROVISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND SHOULD BE PROMOTED WITH A BALANCED APPROACH CONSIDERING BOTH "OFFENSE" AND "DEFENSE."
701	BY APPLYING THE VAGUE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN CONVENTION TO CONCRETE CASES, THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS INCORPORATED NEW RIGHTS ("IMPLIED RIGHTS") TO THE TEXT OF THE TREATY. IN DOING SO, THE COURT HAS EXPANDED ITS RATIONE MATERIAE JURISDICTION. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT THIS PRACTICE CHALLENGES THE MAIN ASSUMPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN EFFECT, THE COURT'S CREATIVE ACTIVITY HAS ERODED THE LEGALITY PRINCIPLE, BY WHICH ADJUDICATORS MUST FOLLOW THE MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES OF AMENDMENT PREVIOUSLY DEFINED BY LAW. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE PROMOTES JUDICIAL SELF-RESTRAINT BY REFERRING SOME FACTORS WHOSE ENDS ARE, PRECISELY, TO IMPOSE LIMITS ON THE COURT'S POWERS.
702	THE RULE OF LAW IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD TO INCORPORATE SEVERAL COMPONENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS INTEGRAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF A MATURE DEMOCRACY: SEPARATION OF POWERS; EQUALITY BEFORE, AND SUPREMACY OF, THE LAW: EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION IN DECISION MAKING THROUGH PERSONAL FREEDOMS; PUBLIC PROMULGATION OF LAWS; TRANSPARENCY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY; AND OTHERS. YET IT CAN OFTEN BE CONSTRUED AS A WESTERN HEGEMONIC, EVEN NEO-COLONIAL, GLOBALIZED CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN EXPORTED TO REPLACE MORE TRADITIONAL THOUGHTS OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG THAT EMERGED FROM UNDER BRITISH RULE IN 1997 WITH A DEEPLY INGRAINED COMMON LAW SYSTEM FOUNDED UPON WESTERN CONCEPTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. YET HONG KONG CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT IN ITS GOVERNANCE ELEMENTS OF CONFUCIAN THOUGHT-JUNZI (GENTLEMAN), YI (JUSTICE), XIN (INTEGRITY), AND LI (REASON). FOR THIS REASON, IT SERVES AS FERTILE GROUND FOR EXAMINING THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF A GLOBALIZED HEGEMONY ON LOCAL POPULATIONS. I ARGUE THAT HONG KONG CONTINUES TO INCORPORATE BOTH SYSTEMS OF GOVERNANCE, EXEMPLIFYING THE PERSISTENCE OF A COLONIAL FORM OF POWER IN THE FORMER COLONY AND DEPENDANT TERRITORY.
703	THIS PAPER ARGUES FOR A THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF SENTIENT NON-HUMAN ANIMALS. IT CRITIQUES THE RULE OF LAW THEORIES OF FULLER, WALDRON, AND ALLAN, BY SHOWING THAT THEIR THEORIES PRESUPPOSE THAT THE LEGAL SUBJECT IS A PERSON WHO CAN BE GUIDED BY LEGAL NORMS. THIS UNDULY EXCLUDES NON-HUMAN ANIMALS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN HUMANS WHO DO NOT HAVE RATIONAL CAPACITIES. IF WE VIEW THE BASIC IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW AS RESTRAINING ARBITRARY POWER, THEN RULE OF LAW THEORIES NEED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHO CAN BE A POTENTIAL VICTIM OF SUCH POWER. NON-HUMAN ANIMALS AND HUMANS, WHETHER ENDOWED WITH RATIONAL CAPACITIES OR NOT, CAN ALL BE VICTIMS OF ARBITRARY POWER. SO, WE NEED A NEW RULE OF LAW THEORY WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL SENTIENT ANIMALS, HUMANS AND NON-HUMAN ALIKE. THIS PAPER SETS OUT SUCH AN INCLUSIVE THEORY.
704	THE RULE OF LAW IS A WIDERANGING CONCEPT. THIS PRESENTATION FOCUSES ON ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN TAX SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR, I WANT TO EXPLORE WHETHER, IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF PARTICULAR TAX LAWS OR A LONGSTANDING ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE, WE CAN BE CERTAIN THAT THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION EXERCISES HIS EXTENSIVE POWERS WITHIN A FRAMEWORK WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW AND THE FAIR TREATMENT OF TAXPAYERS. I WILL BE EXPLORING HOW THE COMMISSIONER CURRENTLY USES HIS POWER OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATION, THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC RULING SYSTEM AND THE STATUTORY REMEDIAL POWER TO MANAGE SUCH SITUATIONS. THIS EXPLORATION WILL ALSO ENCOMPASS HOW SIMILAR SITUATIONS ARE MANAGED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS. AS WE WILL FIND, NONE OF THESE MECHANISMS IS ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY IN ENSURING THAT TAXPAYERS ARE ALWAYS TREATED FAIRLY AND WITH DUE CONSIDERATION. THE SOLUTION, I BELIEVE, IS TO BE FOUND IN A NEW STATUTORY PROTECTION FOR TAXPAYERS WHO RELY ON THE STATED POSITIONS OF THE COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION AND ESTABLISHED ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES. THIS, IN MY VIEW, IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR TAXPAYERS, WHILST, AT THE SAME TIME, PRESERVING THE RULE OF LAW AND ENHANCING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE TAX SYSTEM.
705	IN THIS PAPER IT IS ARGUED THAT DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN TO A LARGE EXTENT BE EXPLAINED BY THE POSITION TAKEN WITH REGARD TO TWO INTERRELATED DISTINCTIONS. ON THE ONE HAND, THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE REGARDED AS EITHER A PRINCIPLE OF LAW OR AS A PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNANCE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE REGARDED AS DEFINING EITHER A MINIMUM STANDARD WHICH SOMETHING HAS TO MEET IN ORDER TO BE LAW OR AS AN ASPIRATIONAL STANDARD IDENTIFYING WHAT IT MEANS TO BE GOOD LAW. IN COMBINATION THESE TWO DISTINCTIONS DEFINE A RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES ON THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY RATHER THAN MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
706	THE STUDY AIMS TO REVEAL THE CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW (RL), HIGHLIGHTED BY THE CASE LAW OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INDIVIDUAL NATIONAL COURTS. IT ALSO ANALYSES THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING AND CONSOLIDATING SUCH ISOLATION AS A WAY TO OVERCOME THE DECLARATIVE NATURE OF THE RL. THE VERSATILITY OF THE MEANINGS AND CONTENT OF THIS PRINCIPLE, ITS DECLARATIVE NATURE OF EXISTENCE AND CONSOLIDATION GIVES RISE TO A NUMBER OF ISSUES, THE ABSENCE OF A SOLUTION TO WHICH IS PRIMARILY MANIFESTED BY THE PRESENCE OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IN PRACTICE, IN PARTICULAR, ACCORDING TO THE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED SELECTION OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RL (PRL), IT IS ADVISABLE AND RELEVANT TO STUDY OFFICIAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RL. THE AIM OF THE WORK IS TO IDENTIFY SOME FUNDAMENTAL INTERPRETATIONS OF THE PRL TO OVERCOME ITS DECLARATIVENESS. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE WORK CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: DIALECTICAL, EPISTEMOLOGICAL, FUNCTIONAL, AXIOLOGICAL, COMPARATIVE LEGAL METHOD, METHOD OF SYSTEM-STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, METHOD OF GENERALIZATION. THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RL BY THE RELEVANT JUDICIAL BODIES REVEALS AND CONSOLIDATES THE MULTIFACETED CONTENT OF THIS PRINCIPLE, BUT THE LACK OF SYSTEMATIZATION OF SUCH INTERPRETATION'S RISKS CREATING COMPLICATIONS IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION.
707	THE NEW WESTERN LAND-SEA CORRIDOR IS THE LIFELINE OF INTERNATIONAL CARGO TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN CHINA AND THE ASEAN. TRANSIT TRANSPORTATION CAUSES ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO TRANSIT COUNTRIES, AND THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE RULE FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW WESTERN LAND-SEA CORRIDOR. THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW ORIGINATES FROM THE DOCUMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY. THE THEORETICAL FOUNDATION OF GREEN TRANSPORTATION IS SUSTAINABILITY. THE CONNECTIONS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SUSTAINABILITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW CONSTITUTE A GREEN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE GREEN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN ESTABLISHING A SUSTAINABLE RULE FRAMEWORK, SUCH AS THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF TRANSIT COUNTRIES TO ENSURE ECOLOGICAL SECURITY, THE INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COLLECTIVE EFFORTS BASED ON INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION RULES, THE ABUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION EXCEPTIONS LEADING TO TRADE BARRIERS, AND CONFLICTING JUDGMENTS ARISING FROM PARALLEL ENVIRONMENTAL INFRINGEMENT LAWSUITS. THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS THE METHODS OF TEXT RESEARCH, CONCEPTUAL INTERPRETATION, AND COMPARATIVE RESEARCH. CHINA SHOULD TAKE THE GREEN INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AS GUIDANCE, ESTABLISH A GREEN FOREIGN AID MECHANISM FOR THE NEW WESTERN LAND-SEA CORRIDOR, EXPLORE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRIBUTION MECHANISM FOR INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION RULES BASED ON COLLECTIVE EFFORTS, ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF TREATY COMPLIANCE TO LIMIT THE ABUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION EXCEPTIONS, AND BUILD A DIVERSIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL DISPUTE PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION MECHANISM FOR THE NEW WESTERN LAND-SEA CORRIDOR.
708	IN 1992 PETER FITZPATRICK PUBLISHED THE MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN LAW, A WORK THAT EXPOSED THE CONSTITUTIVE RELATION BETWEEN EUROPE'S RACIALIZED IMPERIALISM AND ITS CONCEPTION OF MODERN LAW. IN THE THREE DECADES SINCE, A RENEWED FIELD OF "LAW AND DEVELOPMENT" HAS GROWN, THIS TIME IN THE NAME OF "THE RULE OF LAW." THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN LAW ENDURES IN THIS FIELD OF RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT. TO DO THIS, PART I DRAWS OUT THE MAIN THREADS FROM MYTHOLOGY. THESE ARE THEN WOVEN THROUGH THE ARTICLE, BEGINNING WITH THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT'S RULE OF LAW INDEX (R), BEFORE TURNING TO THE UNITED NATIONS' RULE-OF-LAW ASSISTANCE, AND ENDING WITH THE WORLD BANK'S 2017 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW THE MYTHOLOGY OF MODERN LAW, IN ITS RACIALIZED IMPERIAL FORM, IS INTEGRAL TO THE WORK OF INTERNATIONAL RULE-OF-LAW PROMOTION. ONE CONSEQUENCE IS THE DENIAL OF "LOCAL" LAW BY A RULE OF LAW THAT OBTAINS ITS AUTHORITY BY PURPORTING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO LEGAL PLURALISM. BUT THE ARTICLE ALSO POINTS TO THE MYTHOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES OF DECOLONIZATION, SPECIFICALLY THE POSSIBILITIES OF A "MYTHOLOGICAL LEGAL PLURALISM" THAT IS ATTENTIVE TO THE WAYS IN WHICH THE WORLD'S PLURALITY OF LAWS ALREADY RULE.
709	THERE IS A COLLECTIVE WORLDVIEW ON SOCIAL POLICIES THAT IS EXPRESSED AND UNDERSTOOD BY UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONALS. HOWEVER, IT TAKES STUDENTS TIME TO CONSTRUCT THIS KNOWLEDGE. HERE, WE PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS AND A DYNAMIC TO FACILITATE LEARNING OF SOCIAL POLICIES. THE PREPARATION OF A BRIEF DICTIONARY OF SIGNIFICANT TERMS IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED AS A GROUP, ALONGSIDE THE MAIEUTIC WORK TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE TEACHER. THE GOAL IS TO DISCOVER KEYS TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF SOCIAL POLICIES AND THE UNDERLYING VALUES THAT SUSTAIN A SOCIAL AND DEMOCRATIC RULE-OF-LAW STATE SUCH AS THE ONE PROPOSED IN THE SPANISH CONSTITUTION OF 1978. ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE MIXED WELFARE STATE. THIS IS AN INTEGRAL PROPOSAL AND COMPRISES THREE DIMENSIONS. FIRST, IT CONSIDERS THE STATE AND ITS POSSIBLE WELFARE AGENTS: BUSINESS, MARKET, THE CHURCH AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE ATTITUDES WITH WHICH UNIVERSAL AND INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ACTION IS PROMOTED, BREAKING RADICALLY WITH THE AID-BASED MEANING CONTAINED IN OTHER SYSTEMS, ARE THEN ADDRESSED. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE HUMAN DIGNITY AS A PRINCIPLE AND AIM OF INTERVENTION, A BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING OTHER CONCEPTS SUCH AS HUMAN, SOCIAL, LABOUR AND POLITICAL RIGHTS. IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THESE PAGES PROVE USEFUL FOR BOTH TEACHING STAFF AND STUDENTS.
710	THE DESIRE SHOWN BY THE BRITISH TO ESTABLISH THE "RULE OF LAW" IN THE PROVINCES CONQUERED BY THE EAST INDIA COMPANY IN THE LATE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS PART OF A PARADOXICAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT, DISTINCT FROM THE RHETORIC OF THE CIVILIZING MISSION THAT PREVAILED IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. THEY SOUGHT TO GOVERN THE INDIANS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LAWS BETTER THAN THEY THEMSELVES WERE ABLE TO DO. THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF A CRUCIAL CASE FOR THE HISTORY OF THE IMPERIAL JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE PATNA CASE, THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE MECHANISMS SET UP BY THE COLONIAL POWER TO CONTROL THE ADMINISTRATION OF MUSLIM LAW IN THE COURTS OF BENGAL WITH BRITISH JUDGES. IN DOING SO, MY AIM IS NOT ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEADLOCKS ENCOUNTERED BY THE BRITISH IN THE EXERCISE OF A MODE OF POWER WHOSE IMPORTANCE HAS PASSED UNNOTICED SO FAR, I.E. SUPERVISION, IN AN EMPIRE WHERE SEVERAL HETEROGENEOUS FORMS OF LAW COEXISTED. IT IS ALSO TO SKETCH A GENEALOGY OF ORIENTALISM ON THE BASIS OF THE SITUATED FORMS OF REFLEXIVITY DEPLOYED BY THE COLONIAL ADMINISTRATORS, SHOWING HOW AND WHY A KNOWLEDGE CAPABLE OF OBJECTIFYING THE LEGAL SYSTEMS SPECIFIC TO THE COLONIZED PEOPLES, IN THEIR DIFFERENCE WITH THAT OF THE COLONIZERS, BECAME NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE OF IMPERIAL GOVERNMENTALITY.
711	BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON LEGAL DEVELOPMENT EVERY YEAR, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS CONTINUES TO BE QUESTIONED. MANY DONORS HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CRITIQUE BY DEVELOPING MONITORING AND EVALUATING SYSTEMS. THIS ARTICLE PROBLEMATIZES THE TENDENCY OF CONVENTIONAL MODES OF EVALUATION TO ASSUME A LINK BETWEEN THE OUTCOMES OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS (THE 'TRUTH' OF RULE OF LAW) AND THE FULFILLMENT OF OVERARCHING PROGRAM GOALS (THE `CONSEQUENCES'). WE ARGUE THAT EXAMINING THIS ASSUMED LINK IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE AS RULE OF LAW PROJECTS TAKE PLACE WITHIN A HOST OF SIMULTANEOUS POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES; ARE TIME CONSUMING AND UNPREDICTABLE AND HAVE MULTIPLE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES. OUR ANALYSIS OF FOUR RECENT RULE OF LAW PROJECTS FROM ASIA, AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA EXPOSES THE INABILITY OF CONVENTIONAL EVALUATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE SUCH COMPLEXITIES. WE DEMONSTRATE HOW, BY CONTRAST, ROBUST EMPIRICAL RESEARCH REVEALS IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT THE DISPARITY BETWEEN THE ACTUAL, INTENDED AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
712	THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY JUDGMENTS HANDED DOWN BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE ON 16 FEBRUARY 2022 PAVE THE WAY FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE 'CONDITIONALITY MECHANISM' AND PROVIDE THE COMMISSION WITH PRACTICAL GUIDELINES. WHILE THE LATTER ACTS AS AN INVESTIGATION AGENCY, THE COUNCIL DECIDES ON THE ACTIVATION AND RANGE OF SANCTIONS. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF VALUE JURISPRUDENCE, THE JUDGMENTS CONTAIN MUCH MORE. THE ECJ REFORMULATES FEDERAL BELONGING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, SUPPLYING ITS LEGAL ORDER WITH A 'CORE IDENTITY', BACKED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF (UNRESTRICTED) PRIMACY. THE VALUES' NORMATIVITY BECOMES BINDING THROUGH LEGAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THE COURT TRACES IN OTHER NORMS OF PRIMARY LAW, TYING THEM BACK TO ART.2 TEU. THUS, THE CIRCLE CLOSES: WHILE THE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL PROCEED HORIZONTALLY IN A VALUE-PROTECTING MANNER, THE COURT DEFINES THE VALUES' SUBSTANCE VERTICALLY IN A CONCLUSIVE MANNER. FOR AN IDENTITY-FRAMED VERBUND WITH ITS PLURALITY OF ACTORS, THIS CONSTRUCTION RAISES QUESTIONS FAR BEYOND THE MECHANISM ITSELF.
713	THE 'RULE OF LAW' REMAINS AN ELUSIVE COMMODITY IN AFGHANISTAN. SECURING A STABLE AFGHANISTAN UNDERPINNED BY THE RULE OF LAW HAS PROVEN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT DESPITE WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REGARDING ITS FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE. THERE IS BROAD RECOGNITION THAT STRUCTURAL FLAWS IN THE AFGHAN JUSTICE SYSTEM AND LEGAL PROFESSION UNDERMINE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. LAWYERS ARE INDISPENSIBLE TO CONSOLIDATING THE RULE OF LAW; THEY DRAFT LAWS, ADMINISTER JUSTICE, SHAPE GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND INCULCATE RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. YET, NOBODY, INCLUDING THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT, KNOWS HOW LAWYERS PRACTICE IN AFGHANISTAN. EVEN LESS HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING AFGHAN LAWYERS EVEN THOUGH A COUNTRY'S SYSTEM OF LEGAL EDUCATION HAS AN UNDENIABLE IMPACT ON ITS LEGAL SYSTEM. LAWYERS' EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING OR TRANSITIONAL COUNTRIES LIKE AFGHANISTAN, IMPACTS HOW THEY 'PRACTICE THEIR PROFESSION, BOTH IN PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT ROLES.' LEGAL EDUCATION ALSO PROMOTES SCHOLARSHIP AND PRACTICAL EXPERTISE AMONG A DIVERSE RANGE OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. LEGAL EDUCATION IS, THUS, ESSENTIAL TO THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE AFGHAN LEGAL EDUCATION BY WEAVING TOGETHER THE SCANT EXISTING LITERATURE AND COMPLEMENTING IT WITH SEVERAL INTERVIEWS WITH AFGHAN LAW PROFESSORS TO ILLUMINATE IMPORTANT HISTORICAL AND RECENT TRENDS. IT ALSO BEGINS TO GATHER THE BASELINE INFORMATION URGENTLY NEEDED TO BETTER INFORM INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH ASSISTANCE TO THE AFGHAN LEGAL EDUCATION SYSTEM.
714	THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO EXPLAIN, NOT SO MUCH THE EXISTENCE OF ORGANIZED CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN LATIN AMERICA, BUT RATHER ITS SCOPE AND DEGREE OF INFLUENCE ACQUIRED BY THESE CRIMINAL NETWORKS. THEREFORE, WE FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE COMPLICITY OF CERTAIN STATE AUTHORITIES WITH ORGANIZED CRIME. THIS COMPLICITY EXPLAINS THE "SUCCESS" OF ORGANIZED CRIME'S ILLEGAL BUSINESSES IN THE REGION. IT IS MAINLY DUE TO THE IMPUNITY PROVIDED BY THE EXISTENCE OF INSTITUTIONALIZED CORRUPTION, LARGELY BY SECURITY FORCES, AND THE JUDICIAL AND PENAL SYSTEMS. CORRUPTION ENABLES THE EXEMPTION FROM COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. A POSSIBILITY THAT OCCURS WHEN THE STATE LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW. THIS IS ONE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT REPRODUCES THE WEAKNESS OF THE STATE IN LATIN AMERICA. IN THIS CASE, THERE IS A STATE STRUCTURE WITH SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO SUSTAIN AND MAINTAIN SECURITY FORCES, AND JUDICIAL AND PENAL SYSTEMS, BUT NOT TO AVOID THE COMPLICITY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WITH CRIME. IN THIS SENSE AND AGAINST A WIDESPREAD IDEA, A WEAK STATE PROVIDES MORE ADVANTAGES TO ORGANIZED CRIME THAN A FAILED STATE.
715	HOW DOES A PANDEMIC INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW? PART I EXPLORES HOW GOVERNMENT ORDERS ISSUED IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY IN GOOD SHAPE. PART II EXPLORES THE CONSEQUENCES OF POSSIBLE DEPARTURES FROM THE RULE OF LAW FOR LEGAL SUBJECTS, WHO MAY FAIL TO DO THEIR LEGAL DUTY BUT NOT FOR LACK OF COMMITMENT TO THE LAW. PART III EXAMINES POSSIBLE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR DEPARTURES FROM THE RULE OF LAW IN AN EMERGENCY, INCLUDING HOW THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AND THE NEED FOR QUICK ACTION IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY MAY BEGIN TO JUSTIFY A STATE OF AFFAIRS THAT IS NOT LEGALLY IN GOOD SHAPE. PART IV CONCLUDES WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ACHIEVING A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT IS LEGALLY IN GOOD SHAPE MAY BE CONTINGENT ON A COMMUNITYS' AFFAIRS BEING IN GOOD SHAPE.
716	THIS ARTICLE CONSTITUTES THE FIRST IN-DEPTH STUDY OF PRESS CENSORSHIP IN BRITISH HONG KONG DURING THE FIRST CENTURY OF COLONIAL RULE. BY REVEALING HOW THE PRESS, THE CHINESE PRESS IN PARTICULAR, WAS CONTINUOUSLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY MONITORED AND PERVASIVELY CENSORED THROUGH THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF EXECUTIVE ACTIONS, LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS, THIS ARTICLE FURTHER POSITS THAT THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM PRACTICED IN BRITISH HONG KONG DURING THE PERIOD UNDER STUDY WAS COMPLICIT IN THE IMPOSITION OF AN AUTHORITARIAN FORM OF LAW AND ORDER, AND WAS MORE INTERESTED IN PRESERVING THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S OVERSEAS TERRITORIAL AND ECONOMIC POSSESSIONS AND MANAGING THE POWER EQUATION IN THE REGION THAN IN SAFEGUARDING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES IN HONG KONG. HONG KONG IS OFTEN PRAISED FOR ITS RULE-OF-LAW COLONIAL LEGACY, BUT THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH NARRATIVE DOES NOT STAND UP TO THE SCRUTINY OF ARCHIVAL STUDY. THE ENGLISH LAW IN HONG KONG HISTORY, RATHER THAN CONSTITUTING A LENS THROUGH WHICH ONE CAN WITNESS HONG KONG'S QUEST FOR MODERNITY, IS MORE AKIN TO A MIRROR REFLECTING AN ONGOING CYCLE OF COERCION AND RESISTANCE THROUGH LAW. DRAWING ON UNEXPLORED ARCHIVAL SOURCES, THE ARTICLE FIRST DISCUSSES HOW THE COLONIAL GOVERNMENT USED LIBEL LAWSUITS TO PUNISH THE PRESS FOR CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE 19TH CENTURY, BEFORE TURNING TO DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THE DAILY MANDATORY VETTING OF CHINESE NEWSPAPERS BY COLONIAL CENSORS UNDER THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY FOR CHINESE AFFAIRS AND RELATED PROSECUTION CASES IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH AN EXPLORATION OF THE TENSION BETWEEN THE NOTION OF A FREE PRESS AND THE GOVERNANCE FEARS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN THE FAR EAST REVEALED BY THIS HISTORY OF SILENCING THE PRESS IN HONG KONG.
717	IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR URGES DISCUSSION ON THE LEGITIMACY OF MEDIATION PROCESSES, A DISCUSSION THAT IS NOT PREVALENT IN LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT MEDIATION OUTCOMES CAN BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW GIVEN THAT THE SAME CASE CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT IS LITIGATED OR MEDIATED. ON THE OTHER HAND, CRUCIAL AND VALUABLE ASPECTS OF MEDIATION CAN RESULT IN A PRESUMPTION OF LEGITIMACY. WITH THE RULE OF LAW CRITIQUE IN MIND, THE AUTHOR DISCUSSES HOW DIALOGUE THEORY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE UPON THE MEDIATION PROCESS.THE AUTHOR BEGINS BY EXPLORING THE VALUE INHERENT IN THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH POSES A CONUNDRUM FOR COURT-ANNEXED MEDIATION BECAUSE IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO ADMINISTER LAW IN THE SAME WAY AS ADJUDICATION. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT MAKE MEDIATION ILLEGITIMATE. INSTEAD, A FRAMEWORK FOR MEDIATION CAN BE DEVELOPED TO ENCOMPASS BOTH RULE OF LAW VALUES AND MEDIATIONS' UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. MEDIATION IS NOT A WATERED-DOWN VERSION OF LITIGATION; IT IS A DISTINCT PROCESS OF DIALOGUE THAT CENTRALIZES SELF-DETERMINATION AND CONSENSUAL DECISION-MAKING. THE AUTHOR THEN SUGGESTS THAT DIALOGUE THEORY CAN SERVE AS THIS GROUNDING FRAMEWORK FOR MEDIATION. DIALOGUE THEORY EMBRACES THE VALUES OF EQUALITY AND DIGNITY, WHICH UNDERPIN THE IDEALS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE KEY FEATURES OF MEDIATION. UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK, MEDIATORS MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR PRIMARY ROLE IS TO SECURE A FAIR DIALOGUE AND NOT TO CHAMPION A SETTLEMENT. WHERE THERE IS HESITANCY BY ONE PARTY TO ACCEPT A SETTLEMENT, THE MEDIATOR SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE PARTY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN RATHER THAN FORCING THE SETTLEMENT AS THIS FACILITATES GENUINE DIALOGUE. TO ENSURE FAIR TREATMENT OF MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES BY URGING THAT THE MEDIATION PROCESS AND ITS LEGITIMACY BE MORE WIDELY DISCUSSED GIVEN ITS INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN THE CIVIL LITIGATION SYSTEM.
718	EFFORTS TO MEASURE THE RULE OF LAW TRIGGER A PROCESS OF CLARIFYING HOW THE RULE OF LAW IMPACTS PEOPLE'S LIVES. ACCOUNTABILITY EMERGES AS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. NOWADAYS, ACCOUNTABILITY IS CREATED THROUGH COURTS AND BY COUNTLESS OTHER FORUMS, INCLUDING THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. LEGAL PLURALISM IS COMMON: THE STANDARDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY CAN BE NORMS FROM LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, SET BY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS, FORMAL AS WELL AS INFORMAL. MEASURING THE STATUS AND PROGRESS IN THE FIELD OF RULE OF LAW WOULD THEN REQUIRE INVESTIGATING WHAT THESE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS JOINTLY PRODUCE, WORKING TOGETHER AND COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER. BUT HOW CAN THIS BE ESTABLISHED? INSPIRED BY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR, THIS PAPER SUGGESTS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND THE WAY THEY ARE RESOLVED. LEGAL NEEDS STUDIES AND CRIME SURVEYS SUGGEST A CLASSIFICATION OF PROBLEMS FOR WHICH ACCOUNTABILITY IS FREQUENTLY SOUGHT. THIS CAN BE EXTENDED TO OTHER AREAS OF GOVERNANCE. THESE STUDIES ALSO GATHER DATA ABOUT THE INCIDENCE OF PROBLEMS AND WHICH FORUMS ARE ACTUALLY ADDRESSED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. SOPHISTICATED CLIENT SATISFACTION SURVEYS NOW MONITOR WHETHER THIS LEADS TO FAIR AND ACCEPTABLE RESULTS. EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS FOR SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS ARE ALSO DEVELOPING. THE RULE OF LAW IN A COUNTRY MAY EVENTUALLY BE MEASURED AS THE CAPACITY TO PREVENT AND RESOLVE THE MOST URGENT PROBLEMS. INTERVENTIONS CAN FOCUS ON SPECIFIC, URGENT PROBLEMS, OPT FOR THE BEST AVAILABLE 'TREATMENTS' AND MEASURE PROGRESS SYSTEMATICALLY.
719	IF THOSE WITH POLITICAL POWER BENEFIT FROM CORRUPT INSTITUTIONS, RULERS MIGHT NOT ADOPT THE RULE OF LAW SO THE RULING CLASS CAN COMMAND A LARGER SHARE OF A SMALLER PIE. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT IS LARGER IN THOSE COUNTRIES THAT ENFORCE THE RULE OF LAW. IF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES PROVIDE SOME MEASURE OF THE ABILITY OF THE RULING CLASS TO COMMAND RESOURCES, THIS SUGGESTS THAT THOSE WITH POLITICAL POWER COULD BENEFIT FROM IMPOSING A FAIRER AND MORE OBJECTIVE LEGAL STRUCTURE. ANOTHER CONJECTURE IS THAT THOSE IN POWER MAINTAIN CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS TO PAY OFF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO REMAIN IN POWER. HOWEVER, THE RULE OF LAW IS ALSO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICAL STABILITY, SO BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW ALSO ENHANCES THE ABILITY OF INCUMBENT GOVERNMENTS TO REMAIN IN POWER.
720	IN SEEKING TO INSULATE NATIONAL SECURITY CONDUCT FROM EXTERNAL REVIEW, EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS OFTEN PUBLICIZE SELF-IMPOSED RULES THAT APPEAR TO SUBJECT THEIR AUTHORITY TO FAMILIAR, WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL STANDARDS FROM CONSTITUTIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL LAW. BUT EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS SOMETIMES INVOKE SUCH STANDARDS IN PUBLIC WHILE DEVIATING FROM PREVALENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE CONSTRAINTS IN SECRET. THE EFFECT IS TO MISLEAD COURTS, POLICYMAKERS, AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH NATIONAL SECURITY ACTIONS THREATEN INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES. "RULE OF LAW TROPES" LEAD OBSERVERS TO DRAW FALSE EQUIVALENCES ACROSS LEGAL CONTEXTS, OBSCURING HARD QUESTIONS SURROUNDING LIBERTY AND SECURITY, AND ULTIMATELY UNDERMINE THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ESSAY CRITIQUES THE NATIONAL SECURITY EXECUTIVE'S DEPLOYMENT OF RULE OF LAW TROPES, WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON ONE STRIKING BUT BARELY NOTICED EXAMPLE: THE EXECUTIVE'S INVOCATION OF, AND SECRET DEPARTURES FROM, A "REASONABLE SUSPICION" STANDARD FOR PLACING INDIVIDUALS ON THE TERRORIST WATCHLIST.
721	THE LAST FEW DECADES HAVE SEEN THE ENGLISH COURTS BECOME MORE VISIBLE IN THE POLITICAL DEBATE. PARTLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BREXIT, THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE LED TO CRITICISM OF AN EXCESSIVE POLITICISATION OF THE JUDICIARY, WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN REFLECTED IN A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES AIMED AT RE-ESTABLISHING A STRICTER SEPARATION OF POWERS: THE RESTORATION OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S PREROGATIVE POWER TO REQUEST THE DISSOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE REFORM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT BY A BRITISH BILL OF RIGHTS. THESE MEASURES, HOWEVER, CAN ALSO BE READ AS AN ATTEMPT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AVOID JUDICIAL SCRUTINY. THE AIM OF THIS CONTRIBUTION IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER A POLITICISATION OF THE JUDICIARY IS REALLY TAKING PLACE IN ENGLAND, OR WHETHER THE INITIATIVES OF THE EXECUTIVE CAN BE SEEN AS AN EROSION OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND TO TRY TO SITUATE THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN RELATION TO TRENDS IN THE WESTERN WORLD.
722	THE RECENT BACKSLIDING IN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND EROSION OF RULE OF LAW IN TURKEY FOLLOW THE FINDINGS OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE WHICH ALREADY INFORMED US ABOUT THE PATHOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE EXTERNAL PROMOTION OF THE EU CONDITIONS. YET, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE DOMESTIC STRATEGIES OF THE GOVERNMENTS THAT ENABLE THEM TO CAPTURE THE JUDICIARY UNDER THE GUISE OF EU-LED REFORMS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE FREQUENT AND AD HOC INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES DEMANDED AND FUNDED BY THE EU AND READILY ADOPTED BY THE POLITICAL ELITES OPEN A WINDOW OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF PATRONAGE NETWORKS WITHIN THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY THE ADOPTION OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL DOMESTIC STRATEGIES OF RESISTANCE - FORMAL READOPTION, STAFF POLITICIZATION AND INTIMIDATION & BRIBERY - REMAKING, DISTORTING, AND WHEN NECESSARY, REVERSING EU-LED REFORMS IN A WAY THAT ENABLES GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HIGH JUDICIAL BODIES AND CAPTURE THEM FROM WITHIN.
723	AT THE HEART OF EVERY PLANNING SYSTEM LIES THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FLEXIBILITY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY. EVERY SYSTEM HAS A BIT OF BOTH. SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ENGLISH PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON FLEXIBILITY, WHEREAS THE AMERICAN AND THE FRENCH SEEM TO VALUE LEGAL CERTAINTY MORE HIGHLY. THE NETHERLANDS IS PART OF THE SAME NAPOLEONIC LEGAL FAMILY AS FRANCE. HOWEVER, IN THE NETHERLANDS, PLANNING PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE THAN THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF THE DUTCH PLANNING SYSTEM. MANY DEVELOPMENTS DEVIATE FROM THE LEGALLY BINDING LAND-USE PLAN. THEREFORE, SUCH A PLAN DOES NOT PROVIDE MUCH LEGAL CERTAINTY. ON 1 JULY 2008, THE NEW DUTCH SPATIAL PLANNING ACT CAME INTO EFFECT. ONE OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES IS INSTATING THE LAND-USE PLAN AS THE CENTRAL DECISION FRAMEWORK. BOTH THE STEERING AND THE SAFEGUARDING FUNCTION - THE LEGAL CERTAINTY - ARE MEANT TO BE STRENGTHENED. THEREFORE, THE FREQUENTLY GRANT EXEMPTIONS MUST BE REDUCED. HOWEVER, IT SEEMS THAT THE 'EROSION' OF THE LAND-USE PLAN HAS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL ORIGIN IN DUTCH PLANNING CULTURE. BASED ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE USE OF THE PREVIOUS PLANNING SYSTEM, THIS PAPER STATES THAT STEERING AMBITIONS OF DUTCH MUNICIPALITIES, RATHER THAN THE SYSTEM AS SUCH, HAVE CAUSED LAND-USE PLANS - WITH THEIR MAIN FOCUS ON RECORDING SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT AFTERWARDS - TO BECOME OVERLY DETAILED AND EASILY OUTDATED. THE QUEST FOR CONTROL AND THE RULE OF LAW SEEM TO BE ANTAGONISTS; ONE CAN ONLY EXIST AT THE EXPENSE OF THE OTHER. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
724	SIMILAR TO MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA HAS PUBLICLY COMMITTED ITSELF TO THE RULE OF LAW. AS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW, THE GOVERNMENT, MEDIA AND ACADEMICS HAVE EMPLOYED MULTIPLE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE VALUE OF RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING INSTRUMENTAL JUSTIFICATIONS SUCH AS ECONOMIC GROWTH AND CORRUPTION REDUCTION, AND INTRINSIC OR NORMATIVE JUSTIFICATIONS LIKE INCREASED FAIRNESS AND NEUTRALITY OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS. WHILE VARIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW ABOUND, WE KNOW EXCEEDINGLY LITTLE ABOUT WHY THE PUBLIC MIGHT VALUE THE RULE OF LAW. TO UNDERSTAND MASS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE RULE OF LAW, WE CONDUCTED A CONJOINT SURVEY EXPERIMENT USING A NATIONAL URBAN SAMPLE OF 2,100 CHINESE RESIDENTS. WE FIND INSTRUMENTAL JUSTIFICATIONS, ESPECIALLY CORRUPTION REDUCTION, TO HAVE THE LARGEST EFFECTS, THOUGH SEVERAL INTRINSIC JUSTIFICATIONS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT. ADDITIONALLY, INTERGROUP ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INCOME AND EXPERIENCE WITH THE COURTS CONDITION THE TYPE OF JUSTIFICATION THAT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED.
725	THROUGH ITS NUANCED CASE LAW, THE INTER-AMERICAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS MARKED SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND THE OVERALL HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN THE LATIN-AMERICAN REGION WITH PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT HAVE REMARKABLE NORMATIVE INFLUENCE TO THE DOMESTIC COURTS OR OTHER REGIONAL AND GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS FORA. THIS NOTWITHSTANDING, IN ITS ATTEMPT TO ENTRENCH THE RULE OF LAW AND ENCOURAGE POLITICAL STABILITY AMONG STATE PARTIES, THE IACTHR IS PARTICULARLY CAUTIOUS IN LEAVING WIDEMARGIN OF APPRECIATIONTO THE STATES. THIS TENDENCY OF THE COURT IS ALSO EVINCED BY THE ADOPTION OF THECONVENTIONALITY CONTROLCONCEPT. PURSUANT TO THIS SCHEME, STATE COURTS MUST REVIEW THE COMPATIBILITY OF NATIONAL LEGISLATION NOT ONLY WITH NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO WITH ITS RESPECTED INTERPRETATION BY THE IACTHR. WHILE MAPPING THE DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL REACTIONS TO THE DOCTRINAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE COURT, THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHETHER THE LOOMING DIFFICULTY OF THE LATTER TO TRULY EMBRACE ITS SUBSIDIARY CHARACTER IMPEDES THE RECONCEPTUALISATION OF ITS DIALOGUE WITH NATIONAL COURTS AND THEREFORE, THE SOLID CONSOLIDATION OF ITS JURISDICTION.
726	HISTORY MIGHT HAVE STOPPED FOR THE POLISH CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN 2015-2016. AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF BUILDING AN IMPRESSIVE RESUME AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL AND SUCCESSFUL EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS AND LIVING PROOF OF 'THE RULE OF LAW IN ACTION', THE COURT HAS FALLEN UNDER THE RELENTLESS ATTACK OF A RIGHT-WING POPULIST GOVERNMENT AND SUCCUMBED TO IT. THIS PAPER MOVES BEYOND THE HITHERTO DOMINANT PERSPECTIVE OF 'HERE AND NOW' AND LAWYERS' FIXATION ON 'THE BOAT', AND INSTEAD FOCUSES MORE ON THE JOURNEY AND IMPORTANT LESSONS THE JOURNEY MIGHT TEACH US AND ENHANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF 'OUR BOAT'. THE POLISH CASE ('THE BOAT') IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST AN ISOLATED EXAMPLE OF YET ANOTHER GOVERNMENT GOING ROGUE. AN IMPORTANT EUROPEAN DIMENSION COLORS WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED IN POLAND OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN POLAND AND WHY, ONE HAS TO TAKE A LONGER VIEW AND REVISIT NOT ONLY ITS 2004 ACCESSION, BUT ALSO ITS 1989 CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEBACLE IN POLAND MUST BE BUT A STARTING POINT FOR A MORE GENERAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESSES OF THE POLITICS OF RESENTMENT AND CONSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE THAT STRIKE AT CORE EUROPEAN PRINCIPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
727	COMMENTING ON RANDALL PEERENBOOM'S ANALYSIS OF AN OCTOBER 2014 DECISION BY CHINA'S RULING COMMUNIST PARTY ON LEGAL REFORM, I MAKE TWO POINTS HERE. FIRST, I ARGUE THAT PEERENBOOM'S IN MY VIEW INACCURATE ACCOUNT OF (POSITIVISTIC AND NATURALIST) LIBERAL CONCEPTIONS OF LAW PREVENTS HIM FROM UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS DECISION'S DEEPLY ILLIBERAL COMMITMENT TO POWER CONCENTRATION AND PARTY SUPREMACY OVER LAW. THIS ACCOUNT FAILS TO APPRECIATE THE RESOURCES WHICH LIBERALISM OFFERS TO ENGAGE CRITICALLY WITH THE OPERATION OF A LEGAL SYSTEM SUCH AS THAT OF CHINA, WHERE AS I POINT OUT DRAWING ON MY WORK ON HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYERS REPRESSION OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS ADVOCACY HAVE BEEN WORSENING. SECOND, I SUGGEST THAT BOTH THE DECISION AND PEERENBOOM'S ANALYSIS DO NOT FULLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE CHALLENGES THE PARTY-STATE IS FACING, ESPECIALLY THE CHALLENGE ARISING FROM AN INCREASING MOMENTUM FOR CIVIC ACTIVISM AND CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.
728	THE PRESENT WORK ANALYSES PART OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CAN BE MADE BY THE ETHICAL THEORY OF K.-O. APPEL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY OF THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW. THE IDEA IS THAT BY MAKING EXPLICIT THE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THIS ETHICAL THEORY, RELATED TO THE PROCEDURE OF RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PRESUPPOSITIONS INHERENT IN THE PRAGMATIC DIMENSION OF ARGUMENTATIVE DISCOURSE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE GREATER THEORETICAL SUPPORT FOR A DIALOGICAL CONCEPTION OF THE POLITICAL-DEMOCRATIC NOTION.
729	THE DIGITAL ECONOMY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPEN SUPPLY-SIDE REFORM AND UPGRADE CONSUMPTION AND LIFESTYLE IN THE NEW ERA. WHILE HAVING MADE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS, THE DIGITAL ECONOMY HAS ALSO INTRODUCED MANY REGULATORY RISKS AND TROUBLES. THE BASIC LOGIC OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS THE ECO-INDUSTRIAL CHAIN BASED ON DATA AND BIG DATA RESOURCES. SINCE THE CURRENT DATA PROPERTY RIGHTS SYSTEM IS UNCLEAR, VARIOUS FORMS OF COMPETITION BASED ON DATA RESOURCES HAVE SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED EXISTING LAWS AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF AN INSUFFICIENT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPLY AND WEAK IMPLEMENTATION, AND TO FACILITATE THE GROWTH OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, WE SHOULD UPDATE THE REGULATIONS' CONCEPTS AND METHODS, ESTABLISH A NEW LOGIC OF SYSTEM REGULATIONS, IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS BY USING THE OVERALL AND MULTI-LEVEL REGULATION THINKING, AND BUILD A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, DIVERSIFIED AND ALL-ROUND ECONOMIC RULE OF LAW REGULATION SYSTEM LED BY THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OPERATORS, CONSUMERS AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS REGULATION SYSTEM RELIES ON THE SYNERGY BETWEEN TOP-LEVEL DESIGN AND TOP-LEVEL PROMOTION, RESPECTS THE BALANCE OF MULTIPLE INTERESTS, AND FINALLY REALIZES THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL INTEGRATION OF EFFICIENCY, FAIRNESS AND SECURITY.
730	PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS AIM TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTROL OF CORRUPTION (COC) MECHANISM AND THE RULE OF LAW (ROL) IN MEDIATING THE EFFECT OF CULTURE ON TERRORISM FINANCING. THUS, WHETHER THE COC AND THE ROL CAN MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF CULTURE ON TERRORISM FINANCING ACROSS 78 COUNTRIES HAS BEEN EXAMINED. THIS STUDY CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING GOOD INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY TO HINDER ANY DEVIANT BEHAVIOR LIKE TERRORISM FINANCING. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING IS USED TO TEST THE MECHANISM OF THE ROL AND COC IN MEDIATING THE EFFECT OF CULTURE ON TERRORIST FINANCING (TF). THIS RESEARCH TRIES TO INVESTIGATE THE INDIRECT PATH OF CULTURE IN TF THROUGH COC AND ROL AND TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONS IN MOTIVATING OR DEMOTIVATING THE DEVIANT BEHAVIORS. FINDINGS THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT COC AND ROL COMPLETELY MEDIATE THE RELATION BETWEEN CULTURE AND TF. THIS SUPPORTS THE POSTULATION THAT THERE IS AN INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CULTURE AND TF. ALSO, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ROL IS MORE POWERFUL THAN COC, AS A GOVERNMENTAL TOOL, IN CONTROLLING TF. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO AUTHORS' RESEARCH, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY, TO THE BEST OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE, THAT TESTS THE MECHANISM OF THE ROL AND COC IN MEDIATING THE EFFECT OF CULTURE ON TF ACTIONS AND MONEY LAUNDRY.
731	THE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC INVOLVE AT LEAST A TEMPORARY LIMITATION ON INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS WILL HAVE A COMPLEX TIME AHEAD TO DRAW A FRAGILE FRONTIER BETWEEN THE LEGALITY OF THE MEASURES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THIS WORK ENGAGES IN AN ANNALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS TOOLS INCLUDED IN THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS FOR A CONVENTIONALITY TEST OF THE MEASURES, I. E. THE DEROGATION AND/OR LIMITATION OF RIGHTS, THE ABUSE OF RIGHTS OR THE "DETOURNEMENT DE POUVOIR". A POSSIBLE REFRAMING OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF HUMAN RIGHTS' LIMITATIONS IS AT STAKE, TESTING THE STRENGHT OF THE RULE OF LAW AMONG THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE MEMBER STATES AND THE PREVIOUS ECTHR CASE LAW.
732	THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT IN CONTEMPORARY LEGAL THINKING, THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME INSEPARABLE FROM THE IDEA THAT LEGAL DECISION-MAKERS SHOULD GIVE REASONS TO JUSTIFY THEIR DECISIONS. YET, HOW FAR CAN THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE THE LAW BE UNDERSTOOD AS ESTABLISHING A RULE OF REASONS? I EXAMINE WHETHER REASON GIVING IS NECESSARILY CONNECTED WITH THE RULE OF LAW IN THE SENSE THAT A LEGAL SYSTEM WOULD NOT CONFORM TO THE RULE OF LAW IF ITS DECISIONS WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY PUBLICLY ARTICULATED REASONS. I PROCEED BY ARGUING THAT THE FOCUS ON REASON GIVING VINDICATES BOTH PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN MY VIEW, REASON GIVING IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE PROCEDURAL CONCEPTION BECAUSE ALL THE PROCEDURAL ACCOUNT SEEMS TO REQUIRE IS THAT THE STATE DOES WHATEVER IT DOES IN A PREDICTABLE AND CONSISTENT WAY AND JUSTIFY IT BY REASONS. LIKEWISE, REASON GIVING CAN SERVE TO CHARACTERIZE THE CORE OF THE SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL. SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW CLAIM THAT THE RULE OF LAW'S CENTRAL PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE CERTAIN JUST OUTCOMES. IN THAT PERSPECTIVE, REQUIRING THAT LEGAL DECISION-MAKERS GIVE REASONS IS MORE APT TO PROTECT US AGAINST ABUSE THAN OTHER FORMS OF DECISION-MAKING. IN LINE WITH THIS REFRAMING, I CONCLUDE THAT THEORETICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE LEGAL DUTY TO GIVE REASONS THAN HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST, THEREBY LEADING TO A CONTEXT-SENSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS VIRTUE(S).
733	FORTY YEARS AGO, E. P. THOMPSON PRAISED THE ENGLISH RULE OF LAW FORGED DURING THE BLOODY AND FRACTIOUS EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, CALLING IT NOT ONLY "AN UNQUALIFIED HUMAN GOOD," BUT ALSO A "CULTURAL ACHIEVEMENT OF UNIVERSAL SIGNIFICANCE." THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES COLONIAL RULE-OF-LAW DEVELOPMENT AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LAW AND STATE BUILDING. BOTH HAVE RELEVANCE FOR CONTEMPORARY RULE-OF-LAW PROGRAMMING IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH WHERE THOMPSON'S "CULTURAL ACHIEVEMENT" HAS RESISTED FABRICATION BY LEGAL TECHNICIANS. THE PROBLEMS FACED TODAY ARE NOT NEW, FOR COLONIAL RULERS ALSO ENGAGED WITH COMPLEX INDIGENOUS NORMS AND FORMS AND SOUGHT TO BALANCE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES WITH POLITICAL CONTROL IMPERATIVES. CONTRA ARGUMENTS ABOUT COLONIAL "LAWFARE," COLONIAL RULE OF LAW OFTEN FRUSTRATED AUTHORITARIAN TENDENCIES WHILE DEVELOPING NEW FORMS OF LEGAL SUBJECTIVITY AND AVENUES FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES. USING DATA FROM THE INDIAN PROVINCE OF PUNJAB, THE ARTICLE ILLUSTRATES HOW HISTORICAL CASE STUDIES MIGHT AID CONTEMPORARY RULE-OF-LAW PROGRAMMING IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH.
734	THIS PRESENT ARTICLE AIMS TO ANALYZE THE PHENOMENON OF DEMOCRACY, IN ITS SUBSTANTIAL DIMENSION, AND TO DISCUSS THE PARADIGMATIC SHIFT THAT ALLOWED THE RISE OF THE SOCIAL STATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 20TH CENTURY. THIS APPROACH IS MADE BASED ON A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF GUARANTOR LAW, DESIGNED BY THE ITALIAN PHILOSOPHER LUIGI FERRAJOLI. IT WAS DEDUCED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE SOCIAL STATE HAS BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY FAILING TO MEET THE CONSTITUTIONALLY PRESCRIBED DEMANDS THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SUCH A JURIDICAL-POLITICAL STANDARD REPRESENTED AND REPRESENTS AN EXPRESSIVE EVOLUTIONARY MILESTONE CAPABLE OF EXPANSION. THE HYPOTHETICAL-DEDUCTIVE METHODOLOGY WAS USE IN THE RESEARCH IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC METHOD.
735	IN THE LATEST AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) WAS REINCORPORATED INTO THE MAIN BODY OF THE CONSTITUTION. THIS REINCORPORATION CONSTITUTIONALLY OVERARCHES A SERIES OF INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS CONCERNING THE PARTY AND STATE ORGANS IN 2018. IN THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE PARTY-STATE SEPARATION, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO REVEAL THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE PARTY-STATE RELATIONSHIP BEHIND THE POSITIONAL ALTERATION OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CCP IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT AND TO INDICATE ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE CHINESE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW.
736	THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO ANALYZE SOME OF THE ILLEGITIMATE CONSTITUTIONAL MUTATIONS MADE IN VENEZUELA BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER OF THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL OF JUSTICE, DECIDING PETITIONS FOR THE ABSTRACT INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION FILLED BY THE EXECUTIVE, WHICH HAVE DISRUPTED THE RULE OF LAW. A JUDICIAL MEAN OF THIS KIND, SEEKING TO OBTAIN ABSTRACTS INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT HAS BEEN CREATED BY THE SAME CONSTITUTIONAL CHAMBER WITHOUT CONSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, IN HANDS OF A CONSTITUTIONAL JURISDICTION COMPLETELY DEPENDENT OF THE SAME EXECUTIVE POWER, WITHOUT AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE, HAS RESULTED IN AN INSTRUMENT THAT HAS BEEN USED IN ORDER TO CHANGE AND ADJUST THE CONSTITUTION TO THE WILL OF THE EXECUTIVE, BY-PASSING THE CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW PROCEDURES AND THE POPULAR WILL, AND SECURING THE AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT.
737	THE RULE OF LAW IS A HISTORIC IDEAL, AND APPEALS TO THE RULE OF LAW REMAIN RHETORICALLY POWERFUL. YET THE PRECISE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PERHAPS LESS CLEAR THAN EVER BEFORE. MANY INVOCATIONS ARE ENTIRELY CONCLUSORY, AND SOME APPEAR MUTUALLY INCONSISTENT. TO CLARIFY THE VALUES THAN ARE INVOKED BY DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING APPEALS TO THE RULE OF LAW, PROFESSOR FALLON DEVELOPS FOUR IDEAL TYPES WHICH REFLECT THE UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS THAT UNDERLIE FAMILIAR RULE-OF-LAW-BASED ARGUMENTS. BUT THE IDEAL TYPES WHICH TEND TO IDENTIFY THE SATISFACTION OF PARTICULAR CRITERIA AS EITHER NECESSARY OR SUFFICIENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, ARE ALSO INCOMPLETE. MORE THAN IS USUALLY APPRECIATED, THE RULE OF LAW NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A CONCEPT OF MULTIPLE, COMPLEXLY INTERWOVEN STRANDS. IN THE FINAL SECTION OF THE ARTICLE, FALLON DISCUSSES THE RELATIVE PRIORITY OF VARIOUS STRANDS OF THE RULE-OF-LAW IDEAL IN DIVERSE INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS.
738	WRITTEN FOR A COLLECTION TO CELEBRATE THE SCHOLARSHIP OF MARTIN KRYGIER THIS BRIEF ESSAY EXPLORES SOME THORNY QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THE OPERATION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S MECHANISMS MEANT TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW. IT FOCUSES ON THE HESITATION OF EUROPEAN CONSTITUTIONAL ACTORS TO PROVIDE LEGAL RESPONSES TO THE CHICANERY ANIMATING THE ACTIONS OF ILLIBERAL RULERS AS WELL AS ON THE DIFFICULTIES THAT FOLLOW FROM ARTICLE 7 TEU BEING FRAMED AS A RISK ASSESSMENT EXERCISE.
739	THE PAPER DESCRIBES SOME ESSENTIAL ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL WORLD REGIMES AND THE FUNDAMENTAL THESES OF THAT PROJECT. IT CONSIDERS THE REASONS OF THE PROCESS OF JURIDIFICATION AT THE SUPRANATIONAL LEVEL AND DEFENDS IT FROM THE CRITICISM OF THOSE WHO DENOUNCE A FURIOUS AUTOREFERENTIAL EXPANSION OF LAW BY AUTHORITIES AND REGIMES WHO LACK ANY CONNECTION WITH THE POLITICAL COMMUNITIES THEY PRETEND TO REGULATE. THE AUTHOR PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED THE PROBLEMATIC BACKGROUND OF PALOMBELLA'S THESES ON THE "PUBLIC BEYOND THE STATE."
740	IN BOLIVIA, THE THIRD TERM AND THE HABILITATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT EVO MORALES TO THE 2019 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WAS ALLOWED WITH THE ACQUIESCENCE OF THE PLURINATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL COURT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CONSTITUTION PROHIBITED IT AND THERE WAS A REFERENDUM THAT REJECTED INDEFINITE PRESIDENTIAL RE-ELECTION. THIS OCCURRED THROUGH THE JUDICIALIZATION OF POLITICS THAT PRODUCED A NON-FORMAL REFORM OF THE CONSTITUTION PRODUCING A CASE OF ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND THE DESTABILIZATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
741	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS GREEK AND ROMAN CONCEPTIONS OF LIBERTY. THE SUPPOSEDLY 'NEO-ROMAN' VIEW OF LIBERTY AS NON-DOMINATION IS REALLY DERIVED FROM NEGATIVE GREEK MODELS, WE ARGUE, WHILE ROMAN AUTHORS DEVISED AN ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF LIBERTY THAT RESTED ON THE EQUALITY OF LEGAL RIGHTS. IN THIS 'PALEO-ROMAN' MODEL, AS LONG AS THE LAW WAS THE SAME FOR ALL, YOU WERE FREE; WHETHER OR NOT YOU PARTICIPATED IN MAKING THE LAW WAS NOT A CONSTITUTIVE FEATURE OF LIBERTY. IN ESSENCE, THIS ROMAN THEORY WAS A THEORY OF FREEDOM AS THE RULE OF LAW AND THE GUARANTEE OF EQUAL RIGHTS, ESPECIALLY DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. FOR THIS ROMAN CONCEPT OF 'LEGAL LIBERTY,' AS WE CALL IT, POLITICAL PARTICIPATION WAS NEITHER NECESSARY NOR SUFFICIENT. THEORIZED BY CICERO AND HISTORICIZED BY LIVY, THE ROMAN UNDERSTANDING OF FREEDOM FLOURISHED IN EARLY-MODERN TIMES, PROVING IMPORTANT TO PARADIGMATIC REPUBLICAN AUTHORS SUCH AS MACHIAVELLI AND ROUSSEAU AS WELL AS TO HOBBES, WHOSE WORK WE DISCUSS AS A HELPFUL POINT OF COMPARISON.
742	THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE ENGERMAN-SOKOLOFF HYPOTHESIS THAT FACTOR ENDOWMENTS INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, WHICH IN TURN HAS PERPETUATED INCOME INEQUALITY. USING A MEASURE OF THE SUITABILITY OF LAND FOR GROWING WHEAT RELATIVE TO SUGARCANE AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE RULE OF LAW, AS MEASURED BY AREA 2 OF THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM OF THE WORLD INDEX, WE ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL CAUSAL IMPACT OF THE RULE OF LAW ON THE LONG-RUN NET INCOME INEQUALITY. CONDITIONING ON GEOGRAPHY, ETHNOLINGUISTIC FRACTIONALIZATION AND LEGAL TRADITION, THE RULE OF LAW EXERTS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INEQUALITY THAT IS BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO ADDITIONAL CONTROL VARIABLES, TWO ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF THE RULE OF LAW, AN ALTERNATIVE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE AND THE EXCLUSION OF STRATEGIC COUNTRY SAMPLES AND OUTLIERS.
743	WESTERN LEGAL TRADITION GAVE THE BIRTH TO THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. LEGAL THEORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRYSTALLISATION OF ITS STANDARDS AND TO MOVING INTO THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMON CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS USES THIS CONCEPT AS AN INTERPRETATIVE TOOL, THE EXTENSION OF WHICH IS THE QUALITY OF THE LAW DOCTRINE, WHICH ENCOMPASSES CONCRETE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LAW UNDER EXAMINATION IN THIS COURT, SUCH AS PROSPECTIVITY OF LAW, ITS FORESEEABILITY, CLARITY ETC. THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE, FORMER JUDGE OF THE LITHUANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT AND CURRENTLY THE JUDGE OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, EXAMINES HOW THE LATTER COURT HAS GRADUALLY INTENSIFIED (NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY) ITS RELIANCE ON THE RULE OF LAW AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE, INHERENT IN ALL THE ARTICLES OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, TO THE EXTENT THAT IN SOME OF ITS JUDGMENTS IT CONCENTRATES NOT ANY-MORE ON THE FACTUAL SITUATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL APPLICANT, BUT, FIRST AND FOREMOST, ON THE EXAMINATION OF THE QUALITY OF THE LAW. THE TREND IS THAT, HAVING FOUND THE QUALITY OF THE APPLICABLE LAW TO BE INSUFFICIENT, THE COURT CONSIDERS THAT THE MERE EXISTENCE OF CONTESTED LEGISLATION AMOUNTS TO AN UNJUSTIFIABLE INTERFERENCE INTO A RESPECTIVE RIGHT AND FINDS A VIOLATION OF RESPECTIVE PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION. THIS IS AN INDICATION OF THE COURT'S PROGRESSING SELF-APPROXIMATION TO CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS, WHICH ARE CALLED TO EXERCISE ABSTRACT NORM-CONTROL.
744	RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) ARE EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY THE SAME GUIDING PRINCIPLES. ACTORS INVOLVED IN BOTH ENDEAVORS ARE DEMANDED TO BASE THEIR ACTIVITIES ON A SOLID KNOWLEDGE BASE. THEY ARE URGED TO TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH AND TO ENSURE THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENTS OF SUCH AN APPROACH ARE PROPERLY COORDINATED. THEY ARE PUSHED TO STRIVE TOWARDS LOCAL OWNERSHIP. AND, THE CREDIBILITY OF EXTERNAL ACTORS IS DEEMED TO BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS WIDE CONSENSUS THAT BOTH RULE OF LAW PROMOTION AND SSR BY AND LARGE FAIL TO ADHERE TO THESE GUIDING PRINCIPLES. SSR PRACTITIONERS WOULD THUS BE ILL-ADVISED TO RELY ON APPLYING BEST PRACTICES FROM RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, THE OLDER AND MORE ESTABLISHED FIELD, TO THEIR OWN ENDEAVOR. RATHER, BOTH FIELDS OUGHT TO STEP UP THEIR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP PRACTICALLY RELEVANT LESSONS LEARNED THAT COULD THEN, IN TURN, BE RECIPROCALLY USEFUL.
745	WHILE THE RULE OF LAW WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED WITH REFERENCE TO DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS, IT IS ALSO WIDELY EMBRACED BY INTERNATIONAL LAWYERS. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT THE ADMISSION OF COUNTERCLAIMS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HELPS INVESTMENT ARBITRATION ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW ON SEVERAL COUNTS. THE RULE OF LAW IS DEFINED HERE TO INCLUDE NOT ONLY FORMAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS RULE-BY-LAW AND FORMAL LEGALITY, BUT ALSO "THICKER" ELEMENTS ATTACHED TO CERTAIN SUBSTANTIVE VALUES, INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. THE UN'S WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW CLEARLY ADOPTS A BROAD INTERPRETATION OF THIS CONCEPT. THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL FOR COUNTERCLAIMS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS TO HOLD FOREIGN INVESTORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CONDUCT AND THE EXTENSIVE PROTECTION OF FOREIGN INVESTORS IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW. BY DOING SO, COUNTERCLAIMS IN INVESTMENT ARBITRATION MAY PROMOTE THE THICKER ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE LAW, ACCESS TO JUSTICE, AND FAIRNESS IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW.
746	QUANTUM COMPUTING IS MOVING WITH ENORMOUS MOMENTUM FROM SCIENTIFIC THEORY INTO REALITY, EMPOWERING THE POTENTIAL FOR GOVERNANCE DECISIONS TO BE EXECUTED AUTONOMOUSLY BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) SYSTEMS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS A FUTURE WORLD IN WHICH GOVERNANCE ACROSS TRUSTED QUANTUM SYSTEMS HAS ALREADY NAVIGATED DIFFICULT LEGAL AND MORAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE OWNERSHIP OF DATA; THE UTILITY OF CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE; THE EFFICIENCY OF JUSTICE, RELYING ENTIRELY ON DIGITAL EVIDENCE AND THE DEFERRAL OF THE AI SYSTEMS' CAPACITY TO ADAPT THE RULES TO DYNAMIC CONDITIONS. TIME TRAVELLING FORWARD TO 2058, THE CENTENNIAL BIRTHDAY OF THE INTERNET, THIS ARTICLE INTRODUCES QUANTUM LAW, A MACHINE-BASED LEGAL SYSTEM GOVERNING HUMANKIND. THE PURPOSES SERVED BY THE RULE OF LAW ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN TODAY, AS ARE THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH DIGITAL JUSTICE IS ADMINISTERED. THIS FORESEEABLE FUTURE CHALLENGES US TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW TO EVOLVE LAW AND TECHNOLOGY WITH GREATER HARMONY, WHILE STILL PRESERVING AND ADVANCING THE HUMANE VALUES OF COMPASSION, FORGIVENESS, REDEMPTION, EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS.
747	THIS ARTICLE TACKLES TWO ISSUES: THE NATURE OF LAW'S JUDGMENT AND WHAT, IF ANYTHING, MIGHT BE SAID IN ITS FAVOUR. AS TO THE FIRST ISSUE, THE ARTICLE REMINDS LAWYERS OF THE OBVIOUS, NAMELY, THAT LAW'S JUDGMENT IS ABSTRACT, ELUCIDATING BOTH WHAT THIS ENTAILS AND WHY IT MAY BE THOUGHT PROBLEMATIC. THE MAIN BURDEN OF THE ARTICLE IS TO CONSIDER WHAT MIGHT BE SAID IN FAVOUR OF LAW'S ABSTRACT JUDGMENT. ONLY ONE FAMILY OF ARGUMENTS, PART OF A WIDER BUT STILL NOT ALL-ENCOMPASSING CLASS, ARE CONSIDERED HERE: ARGUMENTS FROM THE RULE OF LAW IDEAL. THREE DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS FROM THE RULE OF LAW ARE EXAMINED, THE CONCLUSION BEING THAT TWO OF THREE CANNOT PROVIDE UNPROBLEMATIC AND UNAMBIGUOUS SUPPORT FOR LAW'S ABSTRACT JUDGMENT. 'IT IS NOT EASY-PERHAPS NOT EVEN DESIRABLE-TO JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE BY A CONSISTENT STANDARD. CONDUCT OBNOXIOUS, EVEN UNBEARABLE, IN ONE PERSON MAY BE READILY TOLERATED IN ANOTHER; APPARENTLY INDISPENSABLE PRINCIPLES OF BEHAVIOUR ARE IN PRACTICE RELAXED-NOT ALWAYS WITH IMPUNITY-IN THE INTERESTS OF THOSE WHOSE NATURE SEEMS TO DEMAND AN EXCEPTIONAL MEASURE'.
748	SCHOLARS WHO WRITE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND EMPIRE TEND TO ADOPT ONE OF TWO FRAMEWORKS. THE FIRST DESCRIBES IMPERIAL RULE AND THE RULE OF LAW AS FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE. THE SECOND PRAISES EMPIRES-ESPECIALLY THE BRITISH EMPIRE-FOR EXPORTING THE RULE OF LAW TO LANDS THAT LACKED IT. THESE COMPETING APPROACHES HAVE VERY DIFFERENT POLITICAL VALENCES, BUT THEY AGREE IN SUGGESTING THAT COLONIAL RULE MADE NO SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO TODAY'S RULE OF LAW TRADITION. AT BEST, THE METROPOLE EXPORTED A PREMADE RULE OF LAW ABROAD; AT WORST, COLONIALISM CORRUPTED PREEXISTING COMMITMENTS TO LEGALITY. BUT IN NEITHER CASE DID IMPERIAL RULE ALTER RULE OF LAW IDEALS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, IN CONTRAST, THAT COLONIALISM HELPED TO RESHAPE HOW ANGLOPHONES DEFINED THE RULE OF LAW. IT BEGINS BY RECONSTRUCTING TWO CONCEPTIONS OF LEGALITY IN THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH EMPIRE. AT THE START OF THAT CENTURY, MOST BRITONS SUBSCRIBED TO WHAT THIS ARTICLE CALLS THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS CONCEPTION AIMED AT A THICK SET OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC ENDS, WHICH PROPONENTS SOUGHT TO ADVANCE THROUGH SPECIFIC ENGLISH INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS JURIES. A SECOND, THINNER CONCEPTION OF LEGALITY-WHAT THIS ARTICLE CALLS THE MODERN RULE OF LAW-EMERGED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. LIKE MANY RULE OF LAW THEORIES TODAY, THE MODERN CONCEPTION FOCUSED ON ABSTRACT IDEALS, SUCH AS LEGAL CERTAINTY, RATHER THAN PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS. PROPONENTS OF THE MODERN RULE OF LAW AIMED TO PROVIDE A COSMOPOLITAN STANDARD THAT WOULD TRANSCEND NATIONAL AND CULTURAL BOUNDARIES. ALTHOUGH THESE TWO CONCEPTIONS WERE OFTEN COMPATIBLE, THEIR DIFFERENCES BECAME APPARENT IN THE 1770S, AS POLITICIANS DEBATED WHETHER TO EXTEND ENGLISH LAW TO CONQUERED COLONIES. BRITAIN'S ULTIMATE DECISION TO EMBRACE COLONIAL LEGAL PLURALISM ENCOURAGED COMMENTATORS TO EMBRACE THE NEWER, THINNER CONCEPTION, WHICH WAS EASIER TO RECONCILE WITH THE GROWING DIVERSITY OF THE EMPIRE'S MANY LEGAL SYSTEMS. THIS DEBATE OVER THE COLONIAL RULE OF LAW CONTINUES TO SHAPE OUR EFFORTS TO THEORIZE THE RULE OF LAW. UNDERSTANDING THE RULE OF LAW'S HISTORY ALSO OFFERS NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE POTENTIAL UTILITY OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THAT CONCEPT TODAY. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW INVOKING THE RULE OF LAW IN EVERYDAY POLITICAL DEBATES CAN ULTIMATELY REDEFINE THE CONCEPT ITSELF.
749	THE HARBINGER THEORY OF TERRORISM HOLDS THAT THE EVENTS OF 9/11 PRESAGED AN INEVITABLE SET OF MASS TERROR ATTACKS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE GLOBAL NORTH. IT HAS BECOME THE KEY PREMISE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT IN AN ERA PURPORTEDLY DEFINED BY THE THREAT OF TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM, THESE NATIONS MUST REJECT ALL LIMITS ON THE MEASURES THEY TAKE TO REINFORCE STATE SECURITY. THIS THEORY IS INCOMPATIBLE ON ITS FACE WITH NON-DEROGABLE RIGHTS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO ANY INSTANTIATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ANY INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER. THIS ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT ACCEPTING THIS THEORY INEVITABLY LEADS TO THE EROSION OF THESE RIGHTS, TO THE POINT THAT IN A FUTURE PUBLIC ORDER EMERGENCY (WHICH THE HARBINGER THEORY HOLDS TO BE INEVITABLE), THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE ABROGATED. THIS IS TRUE EVEN IN NATIONS WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRORIST ATTACKS. DEVELOPMENTS IN CANADA DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN THE HARBINGER THEORY AND THE PREMISE THAT RIGHTS MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST SECURITY ARE ACCEPTED, THIS EROSION ACCELERATES.
750	POPULAR SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW SUPPLIES POLITICAL SYSTEMS A BASIC INGREDIENT REQUIRED TO FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY, YET INCREASING TRIBALIZATION AND POLARIZATION IN AMERICAN POLITICS MAY UNDERMINE THIS FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT. HARKENING BACK TO ARISTOTELEAN CONCERNS ABOUT INFLUENCES THAT CORRUPT THE RULE OF LAW, I ARGUE THAT SUPPORT FOR THE CONCEPT STEMS IN PART FROM THE INTERSECTION OF LEGAL POLICY AND GROUP IDENTITY IN THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. USING ORIGINAL SURVEY EXPERIMENTS ADMINISTERED TO REPRESENTATIVE AND CONVENIENCE SAMPLES, I FIND THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEGITIMACY OF THE SUPREME COURT DEPENDS UPON THE GROUPS THAT BENEFIT FROM A RULING. I ALSO FIND THAT THE PUBLIC'S ACCEPTANCE OF DECISIONS IS CONDITIONED ON GROUP CONSIDERATIONS. THESE FINDINGS RAISE BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE U.S. TODAY.
751	THE CURRENT ERA IN THE LIFE OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IS A TRANSFORMATIVE ONE. THE AUTHOR, A SERVING JUDGE OF THE STRASBOURG COURT, THUS FINDS IT OPPORTUNE TO LOOK BACK IN TIME, CONSIDER THE PRESENT AND REFLECT ON THE FUTURE. IN THE ARTICLE, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE LAST 40 YEARS OR SO CONSTITUTED THE COURT'S 'SUBSTANTIVE EMBEDDING PHASE'. THIS PHASE HAS NOW IN GENERAL SHIFTED TOWARDS A NEW HISTORICAL ERA, THE 'PROCEDURAL EMBEDDING PHASE', WHICH IS ANALYSED IN DETAIL. DURING THIS LATTER PHASE, THE COURT HAS BEGUN TO REALIGN ITS PROJECT ATTEMPTING TO TRIGGER INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CONVENTION BY NATIONAL AUTHORITIES USING A MECHANISM TERMED 'PROCESS-BASED REVIEW'. THE OVERALL AIM IS TO SECURE A HIGHER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE LEVEL OF CONVENTION PROTECTIONS WITHIN THE STATES SUBJECT TO EUROPEAN SUPERVISION. HOWEVER, WITHIN THIS PROCESS-BASED REVIEW MECHANISM, NATIONAL DECISION-MAKERS HAVE TO BE STRUCTURALLY CAPABLE OF FULFILLING THE TASK OF EFFECTIVELY SECURING HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS MEANS THAT THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE DOMESTIC LEGAL ORDER HAVE TO BE INTACT. STATES THAT DO NOT RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW CANNOT EXPECT TO BE AFFORDED DEFERENCE UNDER PROCESS-BASED REVIEW IN THE AGE OF SUBSIDIARITY.
752	JAPAN OFFERS ITS AID RECIPIENTS AN APPROACH TO LEGAL REFORM THAT IN SOME WAYS MIRRORS, AND IN OTHERS DIVERGES, FROM THE WESTERN APPROACHES TO RULE OF LAW AID. AS A CONSEQUENCE, JAPAN CHALLENGES WESTERN LEGAL ASSISTANCE GENERALLY, AND RULE OF LAW AID IN PARTICULAR. MORE PARTICULARLY, AFTER CLOSE SCRUTINY OF THE HISTORY OF JAPANESE ODA AND ITS MODE OF LEGAL SECTOR SUPPORT DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, WE ARGUE THAT JAPANESE LEGAL ASSISTANCE EXHIBITS A RANGE OF TRAITS INCLUDING: INCREMENTALISM; COMPARATIVISM; DIFFERENT AID PERSONNEL; FOCUS ON SELF-HELP; BUDGET RESTRAINT; AND HUMILITY. THIS APPROACH HAS ATTRACTED ROBUST CRITICS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS PAPER ASKS THE QUESTION WHETHER THE EAST ASIAN MODEL OF RULE OF LAW ASSISTANCE CHALLENGES THE WEST'S APPARENT ADDICTION TO RULE OF LAW AID.
753	THIS PAPER DESCRIBES AND DEFENDS A NOVEL AND DISTINCTIVELY EGALITARIAN CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. OFFICIAL BEHAVIOR IS TO BE GOVERNED BY PREEXISTING, PUBLIC RULES THAT DO NOT DRAW IRRELEVANT DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE SUBJECTS OF LAW. IF THESE DEMANDS ARE SATISFIED, A STATE ACHIEVES VERTICAL EQUALITY BETWEEN OFFICIALS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE AND HORIZONTAL LEGAL EQUALITY AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE.
754	IN AUSTRALIA'S MURRAY - DARLING BASIN (MDB), THE LAW EXPLICITLY REQUIRES STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING RISKS TO WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY. IN THIS PAPER, WE ANALYSE WATER GOVERNANCE IN THE BASIN, IDENTIFYING INADEQUATE GOVERNANCE STANDARDS AND PRACTICES. CURRENT ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MDB DEMONSTRATE DEFICIENCIES AND VULNERABILITIES THAT LIMIT CAPABILITIES FOR DEALING WITH KNOWN OR EMERGING RISKS AND ERODE THE LEGITIMACY OF GOVERNING INSTITUTIONS. OUR ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REFORM IS INFORMED BY THE OECD'S PRINCIPLES OF GOOD WATER GOVERNANCE AND THE LEGAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE CONCLUDE THAT IGNORING OPPORTUNITIES TO ADOPT BETTER-PRACTICE WATER GOVERNANCE IS A SEVERE RISK TO THE MDB'S SHARED WATERS. TO OVERCOME REACTIONARY CRISIS-REACTION REFORM, WE PROPOSE REFORMS THAT EMPOWER CRITICAL EVALUATIONS OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES, RULES, PRACTICES AND PARTICIPATION. THEREFORE, PROPOSED REFORMS OF POLICY, INSTITUTIONS AND LEGISLATION DO NOT SIMPLY ATTEMPT ONE-OFF CHANGES TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BUT INSTEAD SEEK TO ENSHRINE PROCESSES OF CONTINUOUS, ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER GOVERNANCE.
755	THIS ARTICLE UNPACKS THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW BY DISTINGUISHING FIVE DISTINCT MEANINGS OF THE TERM. THESE ARE: (1) THE RULE OF PRACTICAL WISDOM, (2) THE RULE OF THE LAW, (3) RULE BY LAW, (4) THE RULE OF LAW AS A PRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND (5) THE RULE OF LAW AS A POWER-BUILDING TECHNIQUE. IT SUGGESTS THAT UNLESS THE PARTICULAR MEANING BEING USED IS CLARIFIED, DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT IS LIKELY TO GENERATE MORE HEAT THAN LIGHT.
756	AGAINST INCREASING RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING WITHIN THE EU, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS PRESENTED THE RULE OF LAW AS A WELL-ESTABLISHED AND WELL-DEFINED PRINCIPLE WHOSE CORE MEANING IS FURTHERMORE SHARED AS A COMMON VALUE AMONG ALL MEMBER STATES. IN REFUTE, THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE TWO EU COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE BOTH SUBJECT TO SPECIAL EU PROCEDURES ON ACCOUNT OF THE SYSTEMIC THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW THEIR REPEATED ACTIONS HAVE CAUSED, HAVE CLAIMED THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NEITHER DEFINED IN EU LAW, NOR COULD IT BE DEFINED IN EU LAW. THIS ARTICLE'S PRIMARY AIM IS TO ASSESS THESE CONFLICTING ASSERTIONS. IT DOES SO BY FIRST OFFERING AN OVERVIEW OF THE EU LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON THE BASIS OF WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RULE OF LAW, AS ASSERTED BY THE COMMISSION, IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF EU LAW. IT FURTHERMORE SHOWS THAT IT IS WELL-DEFINED, NOT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE'S EXTENSIVE CASE LAW, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S DEFINITIONAL CODIFICATION OF IT AND MOST RECENTLY, THE ADOPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW CONDITIONALITY REGULATION 2020/2092 WHICH PROVIDES THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ALLEN COMPASSING INTERNAL-ORIENTED DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW ADOPTED BY THE EU CO-LEGISLATORS. THIS ARTICLE FURTHERMORE CONTENDS THAT THE EU'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW REFLECTS WHAT MAY BE PRESENTED AS A BROAD CONSENSUS IN THE EUROPEAN LEGAL SPACE ON ITS CORE MEANING AND COMPONENTS; ITS LEGAL USE AS A PRIMARY PRINCIPLE OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION AND A SOURCE FROM WHICH STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW MAY BE DERIVED; AND HOW THE RULE OF LAW RELATES TO OTHER FUNDAMENTAL VALUES. FINALLY, THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY EXAMINING THE REALITY OF A POTENTIALLY EMERGING EAST-WEST DISSENSUS AS REGARDS THE RULE OF LAW. IN LIGHT OF EVIDENCE OF STRONG AND WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN EVERY SINGLE EU MEMBER STATE IN THE FACE OF TOP-DOWN ATTEMPTS TO SYSTEMICALLY UNDERMINE IT, IT IS HOWEVER SUBMITTED THAT THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL EAST-WEST DIVIDE BUT AN AUTHORITARIAN-LIBERAL DIVIDE AT ELITE LEVEL.
757	THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO LEGAL REFORM IN CHINA IS TO STRESS THE NEED FOR THE JUDICIARY TO ATTAIN THE PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE AND INSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY TO ENFORCE LEGAL DOCTRINE. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT DEVELOPING JUDICIAL CAPACITY TO HANDLE POLITICAL, AS OPPOSED TO LEGAL, CONFLICT MAY BE EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO CHINESE LEGAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE ACKNOWLEDGES THE LEGITIMACY OF CCP OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BUT ARGUES THAT THE VERY OMNIPRESENCE OF THE PARTY MEANS THAT IT IS USUALLY ON ALL SIDES IN INSTANCES OF MAJOR SOCIAL CONFLICT. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON EXAMPLES FROM THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POSSIBLE ROLE OF CHINESE COURTS.
758	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF POPULISM ON THE RULE OF LAW IN HUNGARY AND POLAND. IT ARGUES THAT POLITICAL DISCOURSE IS IMPORTANT IN SETTING THE POLITICAL AGENDA AND IS OFTEN FOLLOWED BY THE CRIMINALIZATION OF MINORITIES, EUROSKEPTICISM, INTERVENING IN THE OPERATION OF SUPREME COURTS, AFFECTING THE DECISIONS OF THE JUDGES, AND DISREGARDING INTERNATIONAL LAW AND/OR SUPRANATIONAL LEGAL ORDERS. IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS HOW POLITICIZATION AND SECURITIZATION INCREASINGLY OPERATE UNDER POPULIST AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES THROUGH THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RULING PARTY. DISCOURSE ANALYSIS IS A VALUABLE TOOL TO REVEAL WHETHER A LEGISLATOR'S INTENTION SERVES THE PEOPLE OR EXPLOITS POWER TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEM. THUS, THIS ARTICLE FOLLOWS THE COURSE OF POLITICS IN HUNGARY AND POLAND FROM DISCOURSE TO HIJACKING DEMOCRACY THROUGH INSTRUMENTALIZING THE RULE OF LAW.RELATED ARTICLESDEEGAN-KRAUSE, KEVIN, AND TIM HAUGHTON. 2009.

759	REFLECTING THE FOCUS OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ON "RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN MOBILITY IN THE AGE OF THE GLOBAL COMPACTS," THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE THREATS TO THE RULE OF LAW POSED BY IMMIGRATION DETENTION THROUGH THE LENS OF THE GLOBAL COMPACT FOR SAFE, ORDERLY AND REGULAR MIGRATION (GCM). IN GCM'S OBJECTIVE 13, STATES COMMITTED TO USE IMMIGRATION DETENTION ONLY AS A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT, WORK TOWARDS ALTERNATIVES AND DRAW FROM EIGHT SETS OF ACTIONS TO REALISE THIS COMMITMENT. GIVEN THE ATTENTION THE GCM ATTRACTS, ITS NONBINDING CHARACTER AND THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF ITS REVIEW CAN BE USED BY STATES AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR INADEQUATE IMPLEMENTATION OF BINDING HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS AND INSUFFICIENT REPORTING ON IMPLEMENTATION TO THE SUPERVISING BODIES. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THESE CHALLENGES TO THE RULE OF LAW, THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE WAYS THE GCM CAN ACTUALLY FOSTER THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AREA OF IMMIGRATION DETENTION. TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY, LEGAL CERTAINTY, PROHIBITION OF ARBITRARINESS, ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT TO AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY, OBJECTIVE 13 NEEDS TO SUPPORT A BINDING HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME BY PREVENTING ARBITRARY DETENTION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN OBJECTIVE 13 ON THE ONE HAND, AND, ON THE OTHER, THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF ALL MIGRANT WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF THEIR FAMILIES AND CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD AT THREE LEVELS-THE DETENTION PROVISIONS, THE SUPPORT PROVIDED TO STATES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROVISIONS AND THE MONITORING OF STATES' IMPLEMENTATION-AND IT PROPOSES MEANS TO STRENGTHEN THE SYNERGIES BETWEEN THE TWO FRAMEWORKS.
760	THE LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES OF VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD ARE SUFFERING A SERIOUS PROCESS OF INTERNAL EROSION AND, IN SOME CASES, A REAL AUTHORITARIAN DRIFT. THIS DEMOCRATIC WEAR DES NOT ONLY AFFECT THE STATES. THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ALSO THE PREFERRED TARGET OF DIRECT ATTACKS BY POPULIST AND ANTI-EUROPEAN MOVEMENTS. IN FACT, IN THESE MOMENTS, SOME ESSENTIAL VALUES OF THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, SUCH AS DEMOCRACY AND RULE OF LAW, ARE BEING PUT INTO QUESTION IN SOME MEMBER STATES. GIVEN THAT THE UNION IS A "COMMUNITY OF VALUES" (WERTEGEMEINSCHAFT) AND THAT THE VALUES OF ARTICLE 2 TEU POSSESS A NORMATIVE VALUE AND ARE ACTIONABLE, THE COMMISSION HAVE BROUGHT SEVERAL INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE ECJAGAINST POLAND AND HUNGARY, FOR THE VIOLATION OF THOSE SAME VALUES. LIKEWISE, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ITS INSTITUTION IN THE CONSTITUTIVE TREATIES, THE MECHANISM OF ARTICLE 7(1) TEU HAS BEEN ACTIVATED AGAINST POLAND. WE ARE, THEREFORE, IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY, WHOSE FINAL OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN AND COULD REPRESENT A SERIOUS THREAT AGAINST THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATION PROCESS ITSELF.
761	MONITORING THE RULE OF LAW PERFORMANCE OF EU MEMBER STATES PRESUPPOSES THAT THE EU HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT IS MEANT BY THE RULE OF LAW. THEORETICALLY, HOWEVER, THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THIS NOTION HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT, LEADING TO A WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERING APPROACHES. MOREOVER, THE APPLICATION OF A COMMON RULE OF LAW CONCEPT IN A MULTILEVEL LEGAL CONTEXT CREATES ITS OWN DIFFICULTIES. AS THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION, WE IDENTIFY A CORE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW BASED ON THE WORK OF PHILIP SELZNICK AND MARTIN KRYGIER. THEY SEE THE REDUCTION OF THE ARBITRARY USE OF POWER AS THE CENTRAL VALUE AND POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF A CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO REALIZING THAT VALUE: REDUCING ARBITRARINESS MAY REQUIRE VERY DIFFERENT CONCRETE MEASURES FROM ONE SOCIETY TO ANOTHER. WE EXAMINE WHAT COMMON IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PROJECTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION IN ITS RULE OF LAW AGENDA, LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT TWO IMPORTANT INSTRUMENTS, THE JUSTICE SCOREBOARD AND THE BETTER REGULATION PROGRAMME. USING THE CONTEXTUAL APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW, WE THEN EXAMINE WHETHER THE CORE MEANING OF THIS CONCEPT IS RECOGNIZABLE HERE, AND WHETHER EFFORTS ARE ALREADY MADE TO ALLOW FOR THE INCLUSION OF CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS. OUR ANALYSIS CLARIFIES THAT THE TWO INSTRUMENTS SUPPORT THE CORE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW BY ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF POLITICAL DEBATES IN THE EU. HOWEVER, UNDERLYING ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS AND APPROACHES AS WELL AS POLITICAL FORCES FORM A CONSTANT THREAT TO THE REALIZATION OF ELEMENTS OF PARTICIPATION AND SEPARATION OF POWERS.
762	THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY PASSED A REFORM PLAN TO BUILD THE "RULE OF LAW", VOWING TO LESSEN LOCAL OFFICIALS' AUTHORITY OVER THE LEGAL SYSTEM, PROMOTE LEGAL PROFESSIONALISM AND AFFIRM THE PARTY'S DOMINATION IN LEGAL ISSUES. THESE INITIATIVES REFLECT XI'S EFFORT TO INSTITUTIONALISE HIS ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN. YET THE RULE OF LAW GOES COUNTER TO THE COUNTRY'S CONFUCIAN OR LEGALIST TRADITIONS, THE WEAK LAW-MAKING AND JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OTHER STRUCTURAL FACTORS.
763	THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN "THE RULE OF LAW" AND "THE RULE OF MEN" IS STILL IN USE, AFTER MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND YEARS. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ARISTOTLE'S APHORISM EXTOLS GOVERNMENT ACCORDING TO INSTITUTIONALIZED IMPERSONAL RULES AND CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT BY PERSONAL FIAT. HOWEVER, THE FORMULATION HAS ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT, DURING THE COURSE OF THE MODERN ERA, HAS GRADUALLY BEEN OBSCURED: ARISTOTLE, FOLLOWING PLATO, IS MAKING A SET OF PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS ABOUT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN HUMAN NATURE, THE WIDER NATURAL ORDER, AND POSITIVE LAW. THE FIRST PART OF THIS ARTICLE OFFERS AN ACCOUNT OF THIS NEGLECTED DIMENSION OF THE ANCIENT CONTRAST BETWEEN "THE RULE OF LAW" AND "THE RULE OF MEN". THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS THE RECEPTION OF THE CONTRAST IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE, FOCUSSING ON THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT TRADITION WHICH EMERGED IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY CONSIDERING HOW THE RISE OF SO-CALLED "FORMAL" ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW TEND NOT MERELY TO DENY THE VALIDITY OF THE CLASSICAL APPROACH, BUT TO RENDER IT INCREASINGLY OBSCURE.
764	THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CURRENT PROBLEMS REGARDING THE RULE OF LAW UNDER THE FIDESZ-REGIME (2010-2018) ARE DUE TO CONTINUITIES OF LEGAL THOUGHT OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE WESTERN LIBERAL CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS LITTLE GROUND TO BECOME ROOTED IN HUNGARY BECAUSE OF THE COUNTRY'S INCOMPATIBLE LEGAL AND POLITICAL TRADITIONS, LACK OF INTELLECTUAL RECEPTIVENESS TO HOST THE IDEA AND WEAK INSTITUTIONS TO ANCHOR IT. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON FIVE ANGLES THAT AFFECT THE HUNGARIAN PERCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW: (1) THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND STATECRAFT; (2) THE SPECIAL TRUST IN LAWYERS AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION; (3) THE RELEVANCE OF THE WAY THE SYSTEM CHANGED IN 1989-1990 IN TERMS OF DEMOCRATISATION AND LEGISLATIVE CULTURE; (4) THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE CARRIED OUT BY THE FIDESZ ADMINISTRATION IN 2010-2014 AND (5) A NEW ERA OF NATIONALISM, AS THE SECOND PHASE OF THE FIDESZ-REVOLUTION, WHICH CAN BE REGARDED AS A DECLARATION OF PARADIGM-CHANGE IN THE CONCEPTION OF DEMOCRACY. THE OVERPRODUCTION OF LAWS WAS THE MEANS OF AUTHORITARIAN DEVELOPMENT, THUS, TECHNICALLY THE CORE PROBLEM OF DEMOCRACY IS THE 'RULE OF LAW'.
765	THE SUCCESS OF REFORMS DEPENDS TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ON ESTABLISHING A STATE BASED ON RULE OF LAW WITH AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY. A FUNCTIONING STATE BASED ON RULE OF LAW STRENGTHENS THE CONFIDENCE OF CITIZENS IN THEIR GOVERNMENT, GUARANTEES THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY, AND PROVIDES SECURITY FOR INVESTMENT. IT IS A BASIC PRECONDITION FOR RESTARTING THE ECONOMY. IN UKRAINE, THE JUDICIARY WAS POLITICISED AND CORRUPT, THE IDEA OF A STATE BASED ON RULE OF LAW DISCREDITED. SOCIETY AND POLITICS FACE A FUNDAMENTAL TASK.
766	THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE MAIN RULE OF LAW GUARANTEES AND THE CRITIQUE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS IT IS APPLIED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. ANALYSIS IS SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTION SURVEY WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AS A PART OF RECONNECT PROJECT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT RULE OF LAW TOPICS REACH THE EUROPEAN MEDIA HEADLINES ON A REGULAR BASIS, THE RULE OF LAW WAS NOT PERCEIVED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE BY THE RESPONDENTS. MEANWHILE TREATY-BASED MECHANISMS AIMED AT PROTECTING EU FUNDAMENTAL VALUES, SUCH AS ARTICLE 7 TEU AND THE INFRINGEMENT PROCEDURE, REFLECT THE DUAL LEGAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES HOW THE EU CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AFFECTS THE PRACTICES OF THE RULE OF LAW-BOTH AT THE SUPRANATIONAL AND DOMESTIC LEVEL-AND OFFERS SOME KEY RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO TACKLE DEFICIENCIES IN THE FIELD OF THE RULE OF LAW.
767	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN MONITORING THE EXECUTIVE AS PERCEIVED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS. ALTHOUGH THIS ROLE IS TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDICI-ARY AND THE LEGISLATURE, IN LIGHT OF THE INSTITUTIONAL MUTATIONS IN MODERN STATES, THE ECTHR CASE-LAW ENVISAGES A MULTITUDE OF FORMS THROUGH WHICH CIVIL SOCIETY CAN MONITOR THE GOVERNMENT AND THUS UPHOLD THE 'RULE OF LAW FROM BELOW.' IN ADDRESSING THIS RECASTING OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF GOOD AND BAD FAITH ON THE PART OF BOTH THE STATE AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THE ECTHR CASE-LAW ON THE MALA FIDES RESTRICTIONS OF RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 18 ECHR HIGHLIGHTS THE IDEA THAT THE MONITORING OF THE EXECUTIVE BY CIVIL SOCIETY IS EVEN MORE CRUCIAL IN STATES WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS SUFFERING FROM A SYSTEMIC POINT OF VIEW AND THUS CIVIL SOCIETY IS THE ONLY ENTITY WITHIN THE STATE THAT CAN GENUINELY MONITOR THE EXECUTIVE. CIVIL SOCIETY, ON ITS PART, SHOULD EXERCISE THESE MONITORING FUNCTIONS IN GOOD FAITH.
768	THIS ESSAY DEVELOPS AN EXTENDED ANALYSIS OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S LOST MASTERPIECE, JURISPRUDENCE, BRINGING IT INTO A RICHER DIALOGUE WITH ITS SOCIAL AND LEGAL CONTEXT. JURISPRUDENCE, A SUFFERING NAKED MAN SURROUNDED BY EYES, EERILY CAPTURES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 'SOVEREIGNTY AND BARE LIFE' THAT AGAMBEN ARGUES WAS RE-FORGED AND REFINED ACROSS THE 20TH CENTURY. KLIMT'S IMAGE MIGHT PERHAPS BE REGARDED AS THE VERY FIRST, AND PERHAPS STILL THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE, REPRESENTATION OF THIS PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT FIGURE OF LEGAL MODERNITY. BUT KLIMT DOES NOT MERELY EXEMPLIFY AGAMBEN'S FORCE FIELD OF JURISPRUDENTIAL VIOLENCE; HE ALSO COMPLICATES AND INTERROGATES IT. DRAWING ON TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURAL EVENTS TO TAKE PLACE IN VIENNA AT THE TIME-THE FIRST PERFORMANCE OF AESCHYLUS' ORESTEIA AND THE FIRST PUBLICATION OF SIGMUND FREUD'S INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS-THE ESSAY DEVELOPS THREE DISTINCT READINGS OF THE PAINTING'S RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAN, LAW, AND SOVEREIGNTY. LIKE AN OPTICAL ILLUSION, KLIMT'S PAINTING HOVERS UNCERTAINLY BETWEEN THREE DIFFERENT BUT EQUALLY NECESSARY PERSPECTIVES: LAW AS IT IS (THE SOCIAL); LAW AS WE IMAGINE IT (THE PHILOSOPHICAL); AND LAW AS IT MIGHT BE (THE POLITICAL). THE PROPER NAME FOR THE HIGHLY CHARGED STUDY OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS JURISPRUDENCE.
769	THE CASE LAW OF THE CJEU DEALING WITH THE RULE OF LAW TOUCHES UPON THE QUESTION OF EXECUTION OF EUROPEAN ARREST WARRANTS (EAWS) ISSUED BY POLISH COURTS. THE YEAR 2020 WITNESSED THE SECOND IMPORTANT JUDGMENT OF THE CJEU IN THIS RESPECT (THE DUTCH CASE). AS IN ITS 2018 PREDECESSOR (THE IRISH CASE), THE CJEU EXCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF OVERT DENIAL OF ALL EAWS ISSUED BY POLISH COURTS. INSTEAD IT INSISTS ON A TWO-STEP EXAMINATION, COMPRISING NOT ONLY A GENERAL EVALUATION BUT ALSO THE EXAMINATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION OF A REQUESTED PERSON. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THIS IS A PROMISE OF ARMISTICE IN THE CJEU'S APPROACH TO POLAND, ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT BELIEVED BY THE AUTHOR OF THE TEXT.
770	RULE OF LAW IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF GOVERNMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, LED BY THE UNITED NATIONS, HAS BEEN ADVOCATING THE ADOPTION OF RULE OF LAW AT INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVELS AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF GLOBALIZATION. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CHINESE TRADITIONAL CULTURE MAY MAKE TO THE CREATION OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. FOR THIS PURPOSE, IT WILL FIRST ANALYSE THE SOURCES AND STATUS OF RULE OF LAW AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL RULE OF LAW, THE CONDITIONALITY FOR CREATING INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW, AND THE DEVELOPMENT THEREOF. IT ARGUES THAT RULE OF LAW IS A SHARED VALUE OF MANKIND, WHICH IS EVIDENCED IN THE TEACHINGS OF CHINESE TRADITIONAL CULTURE; YET, DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENCES IN NATURE, INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW THAT IS APPLIED IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DIFFERS FROM NATIONAL RULE OF LAW THAT IS ENFORCED IN NATIONAL COMMUNITIES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND ARGUES THAT IT CAN SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR FURTHERING INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND FOR REALIZING HUMAN DIGNITY AND WORLD PEACE STIPULATED IN THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
771	THE 'LIBERAL PEACE AGENDA' ASSUMES THAT SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE BOTH INTERDEPENDENT AND COMPLEMENTARY. EVIDENCE FROM COLOMBIA AND GUATEMALA SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT IN PRACTICE CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND PEACE-BUILDING STRATEGIES MAY PRIORITIZE ATTAINING NATIONAL SECURITY OVER THE RULE OF LAW (COLOMBIA) OR TAKING MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW ONLY WHEN FACED WITH SERIOUS POST-CONFLICT INSECURITY AFFECTING ELITES AND THE HOLLOWING OUT OF THE STATE BY ORGANIZED CRIME AND CRIMINALIZED ELITE COMPETITORS (GUATEMALA). PEACE-BUILDERS SHOULD THEREFORE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO STRENGTHENING JUSTICE SYSTEMS AND PROTECTING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF CITIZENS AND VICTIMS OF STATE AND NON-STATE VIOLENCE. STRATEGIES TO INCREASE THE STATE'S SECURITY CAPACITY AND TO REFORM THE SECURITY SECTOR SHOULD BE SYNCHRONIZED WITH AN OVERARCHING RULE OF LAW AGENDA. IN VIOLENT SETTINGS WHERE INSECURITY HAS MANY FACES AND CUTS ACROSS THE BLURRED LINES BETWEEN LEGALITY AND ILLEGALITY SECURITY REMAINS ELUSIVE WITHOUT A STRONGER RULE OF LAW.
772	WITH THE ENORMOUS EXPANSION OF SCHOLARSHIP ON THIS SUBJECT, "RULE OF LAW" HAS COME TO MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS-RANGING FROM SECURITY AND ORDER TO THE OPERATIONS OF COURTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. WE REVIEW THE VARIOUS STREAMS OF THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL RESEARCH BY ACADEMICS AND PRACTITIONERS, EMPHASIZING THE CONNECTIONS TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE CORE LOGIC IS THAT SECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND INTEGRITY OF CONTRACT UNDERPIN, RESPECTIVELY, INVESTMENT AND TRADE, WHICH IN TURN FUEL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, PROPERTY RIGHTS AND CONTRACTS REST ON INSTITUTIONS, WHICH THEMSELVES REST ON COALITIONS OF INTERESTS. FORMAL INSTITUTIONS ARE IMPORTANT, BUT, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART AS WELL. THESE CONSIDERATIONS LEAD US TO CAUTION AGAINST AN EXAGGERATED CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO IMPLANT NEW INSTITUTIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
773	THE ANCIENT TENSION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND JUDICIAL POWER IS APPARENTLY ACCENTUATED WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING EFFECTIVENESS TO SOCIAL RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE MAIN CRITICS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE INCREASE OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN ENFORCING POSITIVE RIGHTS. FIRSTLY, IT IS PRESENTED A REVIEW OF THE MAIN TOPICS REGARDING THE SOCIAL RIGHTS DOGMATIC KNOWLEDGE. AFTERWARDS, THE STUDY AIMS TO ORGANIZE AND DISCUSS THE CRITICS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE INCREASE OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE IN ENFORCING THOSE RIGHTS, WHILE CONTINUING TO RECOGNIZE THEM AS A RELEVANT REFERENCE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATIVE MODEL. THE MAIN HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE OBJECTIONS TO JUDICIAL INTERVENTION IN MATTERS INVOLVING TO PUBLIC POLICIES PRIORITIZE THE FAILURES AND INCONSISTENCIES OF ADJUDICATION WHILE ASSUMING AN IDEALISTIC VIEW ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY, RATIONALITY AND EQUITY IN DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLIC SERVICES. CONSIDERING THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCARCE RESOURCES IS STILL INFLUENCED BY CLIENTELISM AND PATRIMONIALISM, JUDICIAL DECISIONS MAY HAVE A CATALYST EFFECT WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A NATURAL UPDATING OF THE OLD CHECKS AND BALANCES CONCEPT.
774	THE PAPER STUDIES THE EFFECTS OF THE RULE OF LAW ON GUN OWNERSHIP. STRONGER RULE OF LAW ENCOURAGES PRODUCTIVE EFFORTS AND INCREASES THE INCOMES OF CITIZENS THROUGH BETTER-ENFORCED PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCREASING THE INCENTIVES TO PROTECT THEIR INCOMES AND TO OWN GUNS. STRONGER RULE OF LAW ALSO PROVIDES BETTER GOVERNMENT PROTECTION FOR CITIZENS' INCOMES AND PROPERTIES THROUGH STRONGER LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS, REDUCING THEIR INCENTIVES TO OWN GUNS. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BASED ON CROSS-COUNTRY DATA SHOWS THAT STRONGER RULE OF LAW INCREASES GUN OWNERSHIP THROUGH THE INCOME EFFECT BUT DECREASES IT THROUGH THE PROTECTION EFFECT.
775	THE PRIMACY OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS LONG BEEN SEEN AS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) PROGRAMMING, AND PART OF THE LARGER GOSPEL OF SSR IS THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF SECURITY PROVIDERS IS BEST GUARANTEED BY EMBEDDING SECURITY GOVERNANCE WITHIN A RULE OF LAW FRAMEWORK. ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITY OF NON-STATE SECURITY PROVISION, HOWEVER, PRESENTS A CHALLENGE TO THINKING ABOUT SSR AS MERELY THE EXTENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE SECURITY REALM, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WHATEVER LEGITIMACY NON-STATE SECURITY PROVIDERS POSSESS TENDS TO BE GROUNDED IN EXTRALEGAL FOUNDATIONS. THIS PAPER - MORE CONCEPTUAL THAN EMPIRICAL IN ITS APPROACH - CONSIDERS THE IMPLICATIONS OF HYBRID FORMS OF SECURITY GOVERNANCE FOR THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SSR AND RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, AND ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW STILL PROVIDES A USEFUL SOURCE OF STRATEGIC DIRECTION FOR SSR PROGRAMMING.
776	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES RULE OF LAW (ROL) AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) LINKAGES IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE LOOKS INTO WHY INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS CHOSE TO CATEGORIZE A SITUATION AND ENSUING RESPONSE STRATEGY AS RULE OF LAW OR SSR, HOW THIS CATEGORIZATION IS MOTIVATED AND EXPLAINED TO INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS, AND HOW THIS CATEGORIZATION AFFECTS NATIONAL LAWS, INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS IN POST-CONFLICT AND CRISIS SOCIETIES. THE ARTICLE IS BORNE OUT OF AN OBSERVATION, BASED ON EVENTS IN THE ARAB SPRING, THAT THE CHARACTER OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO RULE OF LAW THREATS AND CHALLENGES HAS AS A STRONG FOCUS ON SECURITY. RULE OF LAW PROMOTION TAKING PLACE IN UN AND EU MISSIONS HAS UNDERGONE A 'SECURITIZATION' IN HOW REFORMS ARE CONCEIVED AND PUT INTO PRACTICE, COMPARED WITH RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPMENT AID AND PAST EXPERIENCES OF RULE OF LAW ASSISTANCE IN POST-COMMUNIST TRANSITIONS.
777	EXPERIENCE IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE. COULD INSTITUTIONS BE IMPROVED BY ELICITING THE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE HELD BY EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS? I SHOW HERE THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE LAW EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE CRITICAL OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY THAN INEXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS. MOREOVER, PERFORMANCE INDEXES BUILT WITH EXPERIENCED SUBSAMPLES SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER COUNTRY RANKINGS. ASSUMING NO UNMEASURED CONFOUNDERS, MORE KNOWLEDGE ARGUABLY LEADS EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS TO REVISE THE MORE BENIGN VIEW HELD BY THE GENERAL POPULATION, COMPOSED MOSTLY OF INEXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS. MOREOVER, EXPERIENCE IS A STRONGER DRIVER THAN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE, INCLUDING EDUCATION, WHICH MIGHT THEREFORE BE REINFORCING MILDER AND, ARGUABLY, INCORRECT ASSESSMENTS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY. AFTER OBSERVING HOW THIS 'EXPERIENCE EFFECT' VARIES SYSTEMATICALLY ACROSS COUNTRIES, I CONCLUDE BY PROPOSING THAT EVALUATIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY PAY GREATER ATTENTION TO EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS AND CAUTIONING AGAINST BASING INFERENCES ON ASSESSMENTS MADE BY THE GENERAL POPULATION.
778	A SIGNIFICANT BODY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IS NOW WORKING WITH THE CONCEPT OF REFEUDALIZATION-AS WELL AS RELATED TERMS SUCH AS NEO-FEUDALISM AND NEO-MEDIEVALISM-TO ANALYZE A VARIETY OF CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENTS. THE SOCIAL SCIENCE SCHOLARS WHO USE THESE TERMS CHALLENGE AN OVERSIMPLIFIED MODERNIZATION MODEL THAT REGARDS POWER RELATIONS SUCH AS SERFDOM, VASSALAGE, SUZERAINTY, AND FIEFDOM AS MERELY HISTORICAL RELICS. THE REFEUDALIZATION PROCESS HAS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL DIMENSIONS, WHICH THIS REVIEW OUTLINES TO DRAW OUT THE CENTRAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONCEPT OF REFEUDALIZATION FOR AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LAW, SOCIETY, AND POLITICS. TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE THE CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW; THE PRIVATIZATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES; THE TERRITORIAL UNBUNDLING OF SOVEREIGNTY AND THE TENDENCY TOWARD MULTIPLE, OVERLAPPING AUTHORITIES AND JURISDICTIONS; THE CONTRACTUALIZATION OF GROUPS AND POLITICAL UNITS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS; AND THE CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOVEREIGNTY AND POLITICAL REPRESENTATION.
779	THE SUBJECT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (NTR) CAN PROVE TO BE TRICKY FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THE COUNTRY NOT ONLY PRODUCES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF NTR'S, BUT IT IS ALSO ITS USER. THE CASE OF CHINA IS THE PROSPECT OF THE RESOURCE CURSE THEORY, WHICH STATES THAT COUNTRIES WITH A HIGH ABUNDANCE OF NTR'S MIGHT ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR POTENTIAL AS FAR AS ECONOMIC GROWTH (ECG) IS CONCERNED. MOREOVER, REDUCING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE IN BUSINESS AND DEVELOPING A STABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT DOES NOT POSE A POLITICAL RISK (POL) HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXCELLENT ECG FOR CHINA OVER THE YEARS. THUS THE CURRENT STUDY IS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF GOVERNANCE AMIDST THE RESOURCE CURSE HYPOTHESIS IN THE CONTEXT OF CHINA THROUGH DYNARDL. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS VALIDATE THE PRESENCE OF RESOURCE CURSE IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG RUN. MOREOVER, THE RULE OF LAW (LAW) WAS FOUND TO HAVE A COMPLEMENTING ROLE IN FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT (FDV), WHEREAS POL IS FOUND TO WEAKEN THE FDV IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG RUN. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT CHINA MUST ENSURE THAT THE FDV CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THE GROWTH IT HAS ACHIEVED OVER THE YEARS.
780	IN THIS ARTICLE, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE COVID CRISIS IN IRELAND PROVIDES A PRIME EXAMPLE BOTH OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN PROMOTING THE COMMON GOOD, AND OF WHY ITS VAST POWERS MUST BE CAREFULLY CHANNELLED. WE IDENTIFY THE MODERATE BUT IMPORTANT RULE OF LAW FAILURES THAT BESET IRELAND'S SUCCESSFUL AND LARGELY BENIGN CRISIS RESPONSE. WE MAKE THE CASE THAT RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO EXECUTIVE ACTION AND REGULATION OF THIS SORT-AN INTERNAL MORALITY OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW-CAN CONSTRAIN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE'S SCOPE FOR ARBITRARINESS WHILE ALSO IMPROVING ITS EFFICACY AND PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY. WE SUGGEST THAT THEY CAN ALSO HELP TO RECONCILE TWO CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PUBLIC LAW, THOUGHT AND PRACTICE: THE STANDING NEED FOR AN EMPOWERED AND ENERGETIC STATE, AND THE NEED FOR ALL PUBLIC POWER TO BE REASONED AND PURPOSIVE.
781	IN THIS BRIEF CONTRIBUTION, I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CODE-DRIVEN AND DATA-DRIVEN REGULATION AS NOVEL INSTANTIATIONS OF LEGAL REGULATION. BEFORE MOVING DEEPER INTO DATA-DRIVEN REGULATION, I EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND REGULATION, AND THE RELEVANCE OF SUCH A DIFFERENCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW. I DISCUSS ARTIFICIAL LEGAL INTELLIGENCE (ALI) AS A MEANS TO ENABLE QUANTIFIED LEGAL PREDICTION AND ARGUMENTATION MINING WHICH ARE BOTH BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD COUNT AS LAW OR AS REGULATION, AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THEIR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT. FINALLY, I PROPOSE THE CONCEPT OF 'AGONISTIC MACHINE LEARNING' AS A MEANS TO BRING DATA-DRIVEN REGULATION UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ENTAILS OBLIGATING DEVELOPERS, LAWYERS AND THOSE SUBJECT TO THE DECISIONS OF ALI TO REINTRODUCE ADVERSARIAL INTERROGATION AT THE LEVEL OF ITS COMPUTATIONAL ARCHITECTURE. THIS ARTICLE IS PART OF A DISCUSSION MEETING ISSUE 'THE GROWING UBIQUITY OF ALGORITHMS IN SOCIETY: IMPLICATIONS, IMPACTS AND INNOVATIONS'.
782	THERE HAS BEEN A GLOBAL TENDENCY TOWARDS THE GROWTH OF JUDICIAL CONTROL OVER THE LAST DECADES. HAVE WE TRANSITED FROM A RULE OF LAW TO A RULE OF RIGHTS? THE PAPER OFFERS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SCOPE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS UNDERLYING NARRATIVE. IT DESCRIBES THE LIBERAL IDEALS THAT INSPIRED THE CONCEPT OF A RULE OF LAW AND ARGUES THAT THESE HAVE BEEN PROFOUNDLY PERVERTED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL TRANSFORMATION LEGAL SYSTEMS HAVE EXPERIENCED. I SUGGEST THAT THE TRANSIT TO A RULE OF RIGHTS JEOPARDISES SOME OF OUR CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES, PRIVATISING OUR POLITIC DISPUTES AND ERODING OUR COMMON WORLD.
783	IT IS WIDELY BELIEVED THAT CLIENTELISM-THE GIVING OF MATERIAL GOODS IN RETURN FOR ELECTORAL SUPPORT-IS ASSO-CIATED WITH POORER GOVERNANCE OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE ON THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF CLIENTELISM ON GOVERNANCE OUTCMES IS LACKING. IN THIS PAPER WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLITICAL CLIENTELISM, CORRUPTION AND RULE OF LAW USING CROSS-COUNTRY PANEL DATA FOR 134 COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1900-2018. WE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TWO MANIFESTATIONS OF POLITICAL CLIENTELISM-WHETHER VOTE BUYING EXISTS, AND WHETHER POLITICAL PARTIES OFFER MATERIAL GOODS TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR POLITICAL SUPPORT (NON-PROGRAMMATIC PARTY LINKAGES). WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN POLITICAL CLIENTELISM ON GOVERNANCE OUTCOMES, WITH INCREASES IN CLIENTELISM LEADING TO INCREASED POLITICAL CORRUPTION, AND WEAKER RULE OF LAW. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF POLITICAL CLIENTELISM ARE MAINLY THROUGH NON-PROGRAMMATIC PARTY LINKAGES RATHER THAN THE PRACTICE OF VOTE BUYING.(C) 2022 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.
784	THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CORE OF OUR POLITICAL AND LEGAL IDEOLOGY, BUT THE RULE OF LAW INCREASINGLY IS ATTACKED AS AN UNATTAINABLE GOAL. POSTMODERN THEORISTS CHALLENGE WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO BELIEVE THAT RULES CAN BE FORMULATED FOR GENERAL APPLICATION AND THEN LATER NEUTRALLY APPLIED BY DECISION MAKERS. POSTMODERN THEORISTS REJECT THE ENLIGHTENMENT WORLD VIEW AND ITS POLITICAL COROLLARY, CLASSICAL LIBERALISM. THE AUTHOR AGREES WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE POSTMODERN CRITIQUE, BUT ARGUES THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE RULE OF LAW IN A MANNER CONSONANT WITH POSTMODERN THOUGHT. DRAWING ON THE CONTINENTAL TRADITION OF HERMENEUTICS, OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF INTERPRETATION, THE RULE OF LAW IS REFORMULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSIGHTS OF THE POST-ENLIGHTENMENT ERA. THIS ARTICLE FIRST REVIEWS DEAN GEOFFREY WALKER'S RECENT ATTEMPT TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW FROM A POST-ENLIGHTENMENT PERSPECTIVE. DEAN WALKER DESCRIBES THE EMERGING POST-ENLIGHTENMENT WORLD VIEW AS IT IS REFLECTED IN DISPARATE FIELDS THAT INCLUDE QUANTUM PHYSICS AND TAOISM. HOWEVER, DEAN WALKER'S APPROACH REMAINS WEDDED TO ENLIGHTENMENT CONCEPTIONS. HIS EFFORTS CAN ONLY SERVE AS THE SPRINGBOARD FOR A MORE PRODUCTIVE HERMENEUTICAL INQUIRY. THE ENLIGHTENMENT VISION OF RATIONAL, INSULAR SUBJECTS DECODING THE OBJECTIVE WORLD DOES NOT ACCURATELY PORTRAY THE EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWING. GIVEN THAT THE NATURAL SCIENCES ARE NOW VIEWED AS IRREMEDIABLY INTERSUBJECTIVE AND INTERPRETIVE PRACTICES, IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT LEGAL PRACTICE HAS BEEN STRIPPED OF ITS FORMALIST PRETENSIONS. THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES HOW THIS INESCAPABLE HERMENEUTICAL SITUATION DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE RULE OF LAW, BUT RATHER IS THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE RULE OF LAW.
785	INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (IOS) TODAY CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL LAW-MAKING IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED BY THEIR CONSTITUENT CHARTERS. THE PAPER ANALYSES THIS PHENOMENON OF COMPETENCE CREEP WITH REGARDS TO THE EXPANSION OF THE WORLD BANK'S (THE BANK) MANDATE TO THE FIELD OF RULE OF LAW (ROL) AND GOVERNANCE REFORM. TWO INNOVATIVE AND INTERTWINED CONCLUSIONS ARE FORMULATED. FIRST OF ALL, ON A GENERAL LEVEL, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALIZATION OF ROL REFORM IN THE BANK EXEMPLIFIES THE PATH-DEPENDENCY GENERATED BY THE CONSTITUENT CHARTER WITH REGARDS TO THE SUBSTANTIVE EXPANSION OF OPERATIONAL PRACTICES IN IOS. THE LEGAL MEMORANDUM BY WHICH GENERAL COUNSEL (GC) IBRAHIM SHIHATA INTRODUCED AND LEGITIMIZED THE EXPANSION OF THE BANK'S MANDATE TO THE FIELD OF ROL REFORM, THE PAPER SHOWS, EMPLOYS A SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL HERMENEUTIC, GROUNDED IN THE BALANCING OF INSTITUTIONAL TELEOLOGY WITH CHARTER CONSTRAINTS. SECONDLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PAPER EXPOSES HOW SHIHATA'S RELIANCE ON THE CONSTITUENT CHARTER SHAPED HIS ROL CONCEPT, THEREBY DELINEATING THE SUBSTANTIVE EXPANSION OF THE BANK'S MANDATE AND OPERATIONAL PRACTICE. IN LIGHT OF THE INCLUSION OF THE ROL AS A DISTINCT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL, THIS SUBSTANTIVE INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE BANK'S ROL CONCEPT IS MOST NEEDED. THE PAPER DEVELOPS THE INNOVATIVE ARGUMENT THAT SHIHATA'S CONSTITUTIONAL HERMENEUTIC RESULTED IN A SUI GENERIS BANK-SPECIFIC ROL CONCEPT, WHICH CANNOT-DESPITE PERSISTENT ATTEMPTS IN LITERATURE-BE TIED TO ANY LEGAL DOCTRINAL POSITION. THE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS TWO IMPORTANT FEATURES OF SHIHATA'S ROL CONCEPT: (1) ITS SUBSTANTIVE ROOTS IN STATISTICAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND (2) ITS DUAL FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE DIVIDE. COMBINED, THE TWO CONCLUSIONS AMELIORATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN IOS AND THE SUBSTANTIVE ORIENTATION OF ROL REFORM IN THE BANK.
786	THIS COMMENT EXPLORES MICHAEL OAKESHOTT'S PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION OF A.V. DICEY AND OTHER SCHOLARS. THE COMMENT ARGUES, FIRST, THAT OAKESHOTT'S NON-INSTRUMENTAL ACCOUNT REFOCUSES MUCH OF CONTEMPORARY DEBATE AND QUESTIONS WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW, PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD, CAN BE USED TO SERVE THE STATE'S INTEREST. SECOND, THE COMMENT ARGUES THAT OAKESHOTT'S NOTION OF INTIMATIONS, AS A SHARED INHERITANCE OF LEARNING AND BELIEFS, WHEN APPLIED TO LAW BEST EXPLAINS ITS PRACTICE AND CHANGES. FINALLY, THE COMMENT ARGUES THAT MUCH OF THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE PROPER ROLE OF THE JUDGE CAN BEST BE UNDERSTOOD AS A TENSION BETWEEN THE JUDGE'S USE OF LEGAL INTIMATIONS AND OTHER WORLDS OF IDEAS. THE COMMENT BEGINS WITH A BRIEF SURVEY OF BOTH HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEN EXPLORES SEVERAL THEMES USED BY THE SUPREME COURT TO ACCOUNT FOR IT. THE COMMENT THEN DISCUSSES TRADITIONAL AND CRITICAL THEORISTS OF THE RULE OF LAW BEFORE PRESENTING OAKESHOTT'S ACCOUNT. THE COMMENT CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF LEGAL INTIMATIONS.
787	ON 31 AUGUST 2014, DISPUTES OVER BEIJING'S PLANS TO RETAIN CONTROL OVER THE POLITICAL REFORM RELATING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELECTIONS IN HONG KONG LED TO THE ERUPTION OF A MASS CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE CAMPAIGN AND THE OCCUPATION OF PUBLIC PLACES. IN RESPONSE TO THE AFORESAID MOVEMENT, PRO-GOVERNMENT GROUPS APPROACHED THE COURTS OF HONG KONG FOR AN INJUNCTION AS A STRATEGY TO CLEAR THOSE PUBLIC PLACES (THE INJUNCTION CASES) AND THEREBY PUT AN END TO THE CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE CAMPAIGN. THE COURTS HEARD THE INJUNCTION CASES AND RULED IN FAVOUR OF THE PLAINTIFFS BY UPHOLDING FINDINGS OF PUBLIC NUISANCE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DEMYSTIFY THE ENIGMA OF THE INJUNCTION CASES BY REVIEWING THEM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JUSTICIABILITY, ACTS OF STATE, RULE OF LAW AND SEPARATION OF POWERS. THIS ARTICLE ALSO SEEKS TO MAP THE DIALECTICAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN ACCEPTED PRACTICES IN HONG KONG ON MATTERS OF JUSTICIABILITY AND HOW THE COURTS OF HONG KONG DEALT WITH IT IN THE INJUNCTION CASES. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE COURTS SHOULD HAVE FIRST DETERMINED WHETHER THE INJUNCTION CASES WERE JUSTICIABLE FROM COMMON LAW PERSPECTIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES BEFORE PROCEEDING TO HEAR SUCH CASES. FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION, NOTABLE CASES IN RELATION TO THE DOCTRINE OF JUSTICIABILITY WILL BE DISCUSSED. OTHER ISSUES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW, SEPARATION OF POWERS AND RIGHT TO DEMOCRACY WILL ALSO BE REFLECTED UPON.
788	THIS ARTICLE CONCEPTUALISES THE EU APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW PROMOTION OUTSIDE OF ACCESSION, TAKING UKRAINE AS A CASE STUDY. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, COLLECTED THROUGH DOCUMENT ANALYSIS, EXPERT INTERVIEWS AND PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, REVEALS THAT THE RULE OF LAW AS A LEGAL AND POLITICAL CATEGORY IN EU EXTERNAL RELATIONS HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE ESSENTIALIST SCHOLARLY DEFINITIONS OF THE CONCEPT. INSTEAD, IT CONSTITUTES AN ABSTRACT IDEAL WHICH FRAMES BILATERAL COOPERATION AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND A BANNER UNDER WHICH THE PARTIES REALISE A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES AT THE PRACTICAL LEVEL. THIS EU APPROACH IS DELIBERATE AND MEANT TO ALLOW FOR DEFINING THE RULE OF LAW IN HARMONY WITH THE PARTIES' INTEGRATION AMBITIONS, PRIORITIES AND DOMESTIC INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE FINDINGS' IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE POLICY AND RESEARCH.
789	THE LITERATURE TEEMS WITH DEFINITIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, EMPHASIZING ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS FORMAL LEGALITY, DEMOCRACY, CHECKS AND BALANCES, INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND ORDER. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SYSTEMATIZE THESE DEFINITIONS IN A UNIFIED TYPOLOGY WHICH DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN "THINNER" (MINIMALIST) AND "THICKER" (MAXIMALIST) CONCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE FIRST DO THIS CONCEPTUALLY, ADVOCATING AN ANALYTICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SHAPE (CORE), SANCTIONS (CONTROL), SOURCE (CONSENT), AND SUBSTANCE (CONTENT) OF THE RULES. THESE DISTINCTIONS WE ORDER INTO A CONCEPTUAL HIERARCHY, AND WE EXAMINE IF THIS ONE-DIMENSIONAL HIERARCHY IS PARALLEL TO THE EMPIRICAL ORDERING OF ATTRIBUTES. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF RECENT WRITINGS ON POLITICAL REGIME CHANGE, THE EMPIRICAL HIERARCHY THAT DOES EMERGE MAKES THEORETICAL SENSE. THE CONSEQUENT OVERVIEW ALLOWS SCHOLARS TO SELECT MORE CONSCIOUSLY BETWEEN DEFINITIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND, IF ROBUST, THE EMPIRICAL HIERARCHY CAN GUIDE RESEARCH INTO THE CORRELATES OF THE RULE OF LAW. BUT IT ALSO CALLS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF AND INTERNAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES OF RULE OF LAW.
790	THIS PAPER ANALYZES WHETHER AND TO WHAT EXTENT COUNTRIES RECONSTITUTE THE RULE OF LAW FOLLOWING CIVIL CONFLICT. DRAWING ON AN ORIGINAL DATA SET OF 47 CASES IN WHICH CONFLICT ENDED BETWEEN 1970 AND 1999, WE FIND THAT THE CESSATION OF CONFLICT HAS AT BEST A MODEST EFFECT ON THE RULE OF LAW. ON AVERAGE, COUNTRIES REVERT TO THE PRE-CONFLICT RULE-OF-LAW STATUS QUO ANTE. IN SIMPLE MODELS, RULE OF LAW PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF CONFLICT IS THE BEST INDICATOR OF POST-CONFLICT PERFORMANCE. ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL CASES USING STRUCTURAL BREAK ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE CESSATION OF CONFLICT IS NOT TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INFLECTION IN THE RULE OF LAW; IMPROVEMENTS ARE MODEST, TAKE A LONG TIME, AND FALL FAR SHORT OF PLAUSIBLE THRESHOLDS FOR ROBUST RULE OF LAW.
791	BACKGROUND: TECHNOLOGY PROMISES THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT, TRANSPARENT, CHEAPER, AND FASTER, BUT CURRENT ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS, INTER ALIA, DISCRIMINATION, THE 'BLACK-BOX' PROBLEM, OR CYBERSECURITY ISSUES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS. ACCORDINGLY, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER DEMOCRACIES SURVIVE POTENTIAL THREATS TO LEGAL NORMS ARISES. VARIOUS EU INSTITUTIONS EXPRESS THE POSITION THAT WE MUST PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES THIS LINE IS VERY THIN - THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE HOW, AND WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS SHOULD BE APPLIED IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN ORDER NOT TO VIOLATE
792	THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF TWO DECADES OF UN RULE OF LAW ASSISTANCE IN AFRICA. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON A DATASET DEVELOPED BY THE FOLKE BERNADOTTE ACADEMY WHICH COVERS A TOTAL OF 36 UN PEACE OPERATIONS (PEACEKEEPING, POLITICAL MISSIONS AND OFFICES). IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE RULE OF LAW STRATEGIES IS CHALLENGING FOR THE UN AS A WHOLE, NOT LEAST WHERE PEACE OPERATIONS ARE DEPLOYED. SUCH OPERATIONS ARE DEPLOYED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS SEVERELY TESTED AND WHERE IN SUCH ENVIRONMENTS UN STAFF PERFORM A NUMBER OF CRITICAL FUNCTIONS, RANGING FROM DEVELOPING NATIONAL RULE OF LAW PLANS AND STRATEGIES, COORDINATING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS, ADVISING ON JUSTICE MATTERS AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON SPECIFIC TOPICS. FOR THE TWO LEADING UN ENTITIES IN RELATION TO POST-CONFLICT SOCIETIES, THE DEPARTMENT OF PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS, THE TRANSLATING OF RULE OF LAW POLICY INTO PRACTICAL PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES IS A DAUNTING TASK, SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ASSISTANCE THAT IS TIMELY, SITUATIONAL AND ALIGNED WITH THE NATIONAL PRIORITIES OF THE HOST COUNTRY. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UN'S RULE OF LAW SYSTEM OVER THE PAST DECADE IN TERMS OF POLICY, PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE AND COMPETENCIES EARNED ON THE GROUND, OBSERVATIONS MADE ON THE BASIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA RAISE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS CRITICAL TO THE UN'S FUTURE COMMITMENT TO RULE OF LAW ASSISTANCE IN PEACEKEEPING AND PEACE-BUILDING.
793	THIS EMPIRICAL STUDY SHOWS AGE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN HOW PEOPLE EVALUATE HONG KONG'S LEGAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AMID THE FORMER BRITISH COLONY'S CHRONIC DEMOCRATIC DEFICIT AND RISING POLITICAL DISCONTENT SINCE ITS RETURN TO CHINESE RULE IN 1997. USING DATA FROM A 2015 SURVEY OF 3525 LOCAL RESIDENTS CONDUCTED 6 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF THE 'UMBRELLA MOVEMENT' - A PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTEST LASTING 79 DAYS, IT REVEALS A GLARING GAP BETWEEN OLDER AND YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THEIR EVALUATIONS OF HONG KONG'S ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND HUMAN RIGHTS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE LATTER'S RISING LOCALIST SENTIMENT. IF PERCEIVED ILLEGITIMACY OF A REGIME DISCOURAGES LEGAL COMPLIANCE, THESE FINDINGS DO NOT BODE WELL FOR HONG KONG'S LONG-TERM GOVERNANCE. THE LARGELY YOUTH-LED PROTESTS THAT ERUPTED IN THE SUMMER OF 2019 AGAINST A NOW-WITHDRAWN BILL THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EXTRADITION TO MAINLAND CHINA, WHICH PLUNGED THE CITY INTO ITS WORST POLITICAL CRISIS SINCE 1997, ARE OMINOUS SIGNS.
794	THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS LONG EMBRACED THE VIEW THAT LAWYERS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT LAWYERS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DO MUCH TO PROMOTE IT. IF WE TAKE THE BAR'S PRONOUNCEMENTS SERIOUSLY, WE SEE THAT, FOR THE MOST PART, SO LONG AS LAWYERS ZEALOUSLY PROTECT AND PURSUE THEIR CLIENTS' INTERESTS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW, THEY ARE IN FACT FULLY DISCHARGING THEIR OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THIS CONVENTIONAL VIEW- THAT MERE COMPLIANCE WITH FORMAL LEGALITY SATISFIES THE LAWYER'S DUTY TO UP-HOLD THE RULE OF LAW-IS PROBLEMATIC. FIRST, THIS VIEW MAKES THE DUTY TO UP-HOLD THE RULE OF LAW SUPERFLUOUS, BECAUSE LAWYERS ARE ALREADY OBLIGATED UNDER THE ETHICAL RULES NOT TO VIOLATE THE LAW. SECOND, THIS VIEW ASSUMES- ALMOST AS AN EMPIRICAL MATTER-THAT COMPLIANCE WITH THE POSITIVE LAW IS SUFFICIENT TO MAINTAIN A SOCIETY THAT LIVES UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. YET, A GROW-ING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP ON "LEGALISTIC AUTOCRACIES" CASTS DOUBTS ON THAT ASSUMPTION. WHAT THESE LEGALISTIC AUTOCRACIES SEEM TO DEMONSTRATE IS THAT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO OBSERVE FORMAL LEGALITY WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW.THIS ARTICLE OFFERS A WIDER, ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT OF THE LAWYER'S RULE -OF-LAW OBLIGATIONS THAT BETTER COMPORTS WITH OUR STRONG, ALBEIT VAGUE, INTU-ITION THAT THE RULE OF LAW DEMANDS FAR MORE THAN BARE COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL NORMS AND IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN WHAT IS CONVENTIONALLY ASSUMED. THIS ALTERNATIVE VIEW IS GROUNDED IN THE REALIZATION THAT "THE RULE OF LAW" IS A TELEOLOGICAL NOTION-IN OTHER WORDS, TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF ITS POINT: WE SEEK THE RULE OF LAW FOR PURPOSES; WE ENJOY IT FOR REASONS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT TELEOLOGICAL CHARACTER OF THE RULE OF LAW, NO CHECK-THE-BOX CRI-TERION-SUCH AS COMPLIANCE WITH FORMAL LEGALITY-WILL GUARANTEE THE VALUED STATE OF AFFAIRS IN WHICH LAW ACTUALLY RULES. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE SUB-STANTIVE VALUE, OR TELOS, THAT LIES AT THE HEART OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THE RESTRAINT OF THE ARBITRARY EXERCISE OF POWER, A CONCEPT THAT COMES FROM THE REPUBLICAN INTELLECTUAL TRADITION. BY TAKING THIS SUBSTANTIVE VALUE SERIOUSLY AND CON-STRUCTING A THICKER, MORE SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW AROUND THIS VALUE, WE BETTER APPRECIATE THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH OUR SOCI-ETY FALLS SHORT OF THAT IDEAL, AND WE CAN BETTER SEE WHY AND HOW THE CONVEN-TIONAL VIEW OF THE LAWYER'S DUTY TO UPHOLD THE LAW, GROUNDED IN LEGALISM, FALLS SHORT OF RESPECTING AND NURTURING THE RULE OF LAW.
795	SCHOLARS TYPICALLY REGARD THE RULE OF LAW-A STABLE AND PREDICTABLE PROCESS BY WHICH LAWS ARE IMPLEMENTED, ENFORCED, AND CHANGED-AS A CORNERSTONE OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND A KEY FACTOR SUPPORTING ECONOMIC GROWTH. YET ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW INVOLVES A TRADE-OFF: EX ANTE COMMITMENT BECOMES MORE CREDIBLE, BUT EX POST ADJUSTMENTS IN RESPONSE TO NEW INFORMATION BECOME MORE COSTLY. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS TRADE-OFF HELPS TO EXPLAIN THE DESIGN OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE FIRST RULE-OF-LAW STATE: ANCIENT ATHENS. NO ART WHATSOEVER CAN MAKE A RULE THAT WILL LAST FOR ALL TIME. HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS BUT THE LAW IS ALWAYS STRIVING TO MAKE ONE-LIKE AN OBSTINATE AND IGNORANT TYRANT WHO WILL NOT ALLOW ANYTHING TO BE DONE CONTRARY TO HIS APPOINTMENT, OR ANY QUESTION TO BE ASKED-NOT EVEN IN SUDDEN CHANGES OF CIRCUMSTANCES, WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT HE COMMANDED. (PLATO, STATESMAN III.579) RIGHTLY CONSTITUTED LAWS SHOULD BE THE FINAL SOVEREIGN; AND PERSONAL RULE, WHETHER IT BE EXERCISED BY A SINGLE PERSON OR A BODY OF PERSONS, SHOULD BE SOVEREIGN ONLY IN THOSE MATTERS ON WHICH LAW IS UNABLE, OWING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF FRAMING GENERAL RULES FOR ALL CONTINGENCIES, TO MAKE AN EXACT PRONOUNCEMENT. (ARISTOTLE, POLITICS 3.1282B)
796	COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE CORE VALUES OF A LIBERAL LEGAL SYSTEM. THE ADHERENTS OF SUCH A SYSTEM USUALLY REGARD THE CONCEPT OF A ''GOVERNMENT OF LAWS AND NOT PEOPLE'' AS THE CHIEF PROTECTOR OF THE CITIZENS' LIBERTY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE. IT BEGINS WITH WHAT IS INTENDED AS AN ENTERTAINING REPRISE OF THE MAIN JURISPRUDENTIAL ARGUMENTS DESIGNED TO SHOW THAT THERE IS, IN FACT, NO SUCH THING AS A GOVERNMENT OF LAWS AND NOT PEOPLE AND THAT THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS CONSTITUTES A MYTH THAT SERVES TO MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S SUPPORT FOR SOCIETY'S POWER STRUCTURE. IT THEN SUGGESTS THAT THE MAINTENANCE OF LIBERTY REQUIRES NOT ONLY THE ABANDONMENT OF THE IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW, BUT THE COMMITMENT TO A MONOPOLISTIC LEGAL SYSTEM AS WELL. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING, IN A SOMEWHAT FANCIFUL WAY, THAT THE PRESERVATION OF A TRULY FREE SOCIETY REQUIRES LIBERATING THE LAW FROM STATE CONTROL TO ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MARKET FOR LAW.
797	IN THIS ARTICLE WE DISCUSS THE INTEGRATION OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND RULE OF LAW PROMOTION WITHIN LARGER STATE-BUILDING PROJECTS. GOING BEYOND THE WIDESPREAD CLAIM THAT BOTH APPROACHES SHOULD BE CLOSELY LINKED WITHIN OVERARCHING SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) EFFORTS, THIS ARTICLE INQUIRES MORE SYSTEMATICALLY INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP BOTH AT A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL AND AT THE LEVEL OF STATE-BUILDING PRACTICES. IT ARGUES THAT THE CREATION OF EFFECTIVE SECURITY INSTITUTIONS CANNOT BE EASILY RECONCILED WITH PROGRAMMES THAT PROMOTE MECHANISMS OF LEGITIMATE POLITICAL CONTROL AS ONE DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW. RATIONALES BEHIND SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW SUPPORT DIVERGE: THE FORMER AIMS TO STRENGTHEN A STATE'S ENFORCEMENT CAPACITIES, WHILE THE LATTER SEEKS TO RESTRICT THEM. THE CASE OF SECURITY AND RULE OF LAW SUPPORT TO THE PALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY IN THE WEST BANK ILLUSTRATES THE TENSIONS THAT CAN RESULT. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT IN THE PALESTINIAN CASE, SELECTIVITY, FRAGMENTATION AND TIMING ISSUES HAVE IMPEDED THE COHERENCE OF INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE.
798	THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE USE OF CIVIC EDUCATION AND EDUCATION IN DEMOCRATIC VALUES AS AN INSTRUMENT TO COMBAT CITIZENS' DISAFFECTION TOWARDS DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. BASED ON A STUDY OF INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES, PARTICULARLY THOSE AT EUROPEAN LEVEL, IT EXAMINES WHAT THE CONTENTS OF THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE, AND WHAT PROBLEMS MAY ARISE WHEN IT COMES TO PUTTING THEM INTO PRACTICE. FINALLY, SOME PROPOSALS ARE MADE ON THE BASIC ELEMENTS THAT SHOULD FORM PART OF THIS SUBJECT.
799	OBJECTIVES TO EXPLORE WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS A FOUNDATIONAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH THAT UNDERLIES OTHER SOCIOECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH OUTCOMES. SETTING GLOBAL PROJECT. PARTICIPANTS DATA SET OF 96 COUNTRIES, COMPRISING 91% OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES THE FOLLOWING HEALTH INDICATORS, INFANT MORTALITY RATE, MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES MORTALITY RATE, WERE INCLUDED TO EXPLORE THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH THE RULE OF LAW. WE USED A NOVEL RULE OF LAW INDEX, GATHERED FROM SURVEY SOURCES, IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL AND ECOLOGICAL DESIGN. THE INDEX IS BASED ON EIGHT SUBINDICES: (1) CONSTRAINTS ON GOVERNMENT POWERS; (2) ABSENCE OF CORRUPTION; (3) ORDER AND SECURITY; (4) FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS; (5) OPEN GOVERNMENT; (6) REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT, (7) CIVIL JUSTICE; AND (8) CRIMINAL JUSTICE. RESULTS THE RULE OF LAW SHOWED AN INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION WITH INFANT MORTALITY RATE, MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE, LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES MORTALITY RATE, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE COUNTRIES' LEVEL OF PER CAPITA INCOME, THEIR EXPENDITURES IN HEALTH, THEIR LEVEL OF POLITICAL AND CIVIL FREEDOM, THEIR GINI MEASURE OF INEQUALITY AND WOMEN'S STATUS (P<0.05). RULE OF LAW REMAINED SIGNIFICANT IN ALL THE MULTIVARIATE MODELS, AND THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENT FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS REMAINED ROBUST FOR AT LEAST ONE OR MORE OF THE HEALTH OUTCOMES ACROSS ALL EIGHT SUBINDICES OF THE RULE OF LAW. FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE HIGHER THE COUNTRY'S LEVEL OF ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW, THE BETTER THE HEALTH OF THE POPULATION. CONCLUSIONS IT IS NECESSARY TO START CONSIDERING THE COUNTRY'S ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW AS A FOUNDATIONAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH. HEALTH ADVOCATES SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPROVEMENT OF RULE OF LAW AS A TOOL TO IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH. CONVERSELY, LACK OF PROGRESS IN RULE OF LAW MAY CONSTITUTE A STRUCTURAL BARRIER TO HEALTH IMPROVEMENT.
800	THIS WORK EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND LEGAL CENTRAL BANK INDEPENDENCE (CBI) ON PRICE STABILITY (THE LEVEL OF INFLATION AND INFLATION VOLATILITY), EMPLOYING A PANEL DATASET THAT COVERS UP TO 124 COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD FROM 1970 TO 2013. A NEW, LARGELY COMPLETE LEGAL CBI DATASET, COVERING 182 COUNTRIES WAS USED FOR THE WORK. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE EFFECT OF LEGAL CBI ON PRICE STABILITY DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE RULE OF LAW. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT LEGAL CBI HAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PRICE STABILITY WHEN THE RULE OF LAW IS WEAK. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT 67% OF ADVANCED COUNTRIES POSSESS A RULE OF LAW THAT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN PRICE STABILITY BY INCREASING CENTRAL BANK AUTONOMY, WHILE ONLY 4.5% OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES POSSESS IT.
801	ONE OF THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW IS THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY, WHICH PROVIDES, INTER ALIA, THAT IN ANY DISPUTE, A COURT DECISION THAT HAS ENTERED INTO FORCE CANNOT BE CALLED INTO QUESTION. THE SUBJECT OF THE MOST DISCUSSED TODAY CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS TODAY SEEN AS A STRUCTURAL ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, NECESSARY FOR THE STABILIZATION OF LEGAL RELATIONS AND SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE JUDICIARY AND COURTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE PRINCIPLE IS THE MAIN COMMANDMENT OF THE SYSTEM, ITS TRUE BASIS; DISPOSITION, WHICH RADIATES DIFFERENT NORMS, COMPOSING THEIR SPIRIT AND SERVING AS A CRITERION FOR THEIR PRECISE UNDERSTANDING AND REASON, PRECISELY BECAUSE IT DETERMINES THE LOGIC AND RATIONALITY OF THE NORMATIVE SYSTEM, IN THAT IT GIVES IT A TONIC AND GIVES IT A HARMONIOUS MEANING. THE PRINCIPLE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL CATEGORY, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT RELATE TO THE PROCESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF FOUNDATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT COVER A MODERN TOPIC, STARTING WITH THE UNDENIABLE THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL EVOLUTION OF ITS BASIS AND EVALUATIVE NATURE, WHICH, IN A MORE COMPLEX AND COMPLEX FORM, YEARS HAS MEANT A KIND OF SET OF CONTENT AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE INTERRELATED FOR THE REGULATION OF LIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND STATE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH IS A GUARANTEE OF THE STABILITY OF LAW. THE CASE IS RELEVANT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RELATIONS PREVAILING IN THE POSTMODERN WORLD, WITH UNDENIABLE INSECURITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY TODAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND LEGAL SPHERES, THE REFLEXES OF WHICH IN LAW ARE EVEN MORE OBVIOUS. FROM THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOLLOWS THE REQUIREMENT OF CERTAINTY, CLARITY AND UNAMBIGUITY OF THE LEGAL NORM, AS OTHERWISE CAN NOT ENSURE ITS UNIFORM APPLICATION, DOES NOT PRECLUDE UNLIMITED INTERPRETATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICE AND INEVITABLY LEADS TO ARBITRARINESS. LEGAL CERTAINTY IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN LAW-MAKING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCESSES. NUMEROUS DECISIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST UKRAINE, WHICH HAVE A DIRECT INDICATION OF NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE STATE WITH THIS PRINCIPLE, ALLOW US TO QUALIFY THE COMMENTED LEGAL IDEA AS A FUNDAMENTAL AND INDEPENDENT PHENOMENON. LEGAL CERTAINTY, AS IT FOLLOWS FROM THE TEXTS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF JUDGES, MEANS CLARITY, CERTAINTY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LEGAL STANDARD.
802	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SEEK TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP IN THE FIELD OF INQUIRY KNOWN AS THE 'CRIMINOLOGY OF MOBILITY', WHERE COUNTRIES ARE USING CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES AND PROCEDURES IN THE NAME OF BORDER CONTROL. IT EXPLORES THE DEGREE TO WHICH MACEDONIA COMPLIED WITH INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND DOMESTIC MACEDONIAN LAW WHEN IT DETAINED 1003 MIGRANTS AT ITS GAZI BABA 'RECEPTION CENTRE FOR FOREIGNERS' FROM 1 JANUARY UNTIL 15 JUNE 2015. REPORTS FROM HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANISATIONS AND INTERVIEWS WITH WITNESSES SUGGEST THAT THE REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS AT GAZI BABA WERE ARBITRARILY DETAINED AND SUBJECTED TO DEGRADING TREATMENT. IT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF A COUNTRY LIKE MACEDONIA TO OBSERVE THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPING A DEMOCRACY, ESPECIALLY IN THE APPLICATION OF BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, AND TO ESTABLISH FUNCTIONAL INSTITUTIONS SERVING PUBLICLY STATED PURPOSES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LEGITIMATE CONTROL AGAINST STATE AND NON-STATE MISCONDUCT.
803	DURING 2017-2019 ROMANIA FACED A CONTROVERSIAL JUSTICE LAWS' 'REFORM', UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW AND INDEPENDENCE OF JUSTICE PRINCIPLES, CHALLENGING THE COMMITMENTS ESTABLISHED UNDER COMMISSION DECISION 2006/928/EC IN THE AREAS OF JUDICIAL REFORM AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION. IN THE CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EU-ROPE, ROMANIAN EVOLUTIONS COULD BE SEEN AS FOLLOW-ING A REGIONAL PATTERN. THE STUDY PROPOSES A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE EVOLUTIONS IN THE AREA OF JUSTICE AND FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION IN THE REGION, AS REFLECTED BY THE COOPERATION AND VERI-FICATION MECHANISM FOR ROMANIA (CVM) AND RULE OF LAW REPORTS, EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE AND EUROPE-AN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS JUDGEMENTS. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON SOME CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS OF THE CON-STITUTIONAL COURT, CONCERNING JUSTICE LAWS 'REFORM' AND THE APPLICATION OF PRIMACY OF EU LAW PRINCIPLE. THE STUDY EXPRESSES A STRONG CONCERN RELATED TO ROMANIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT'S TENDENCIES TO WALK ALONG THE AUTHORITARIAN PATH OF POLITICALLY CAPTURED COURTS OF POLAND AND HUNGARY. THE CONCLUSIONS RE-VEAL THE REQUIREMENT FOR NEW POLITICAL INSTRUMENTS OF EU SUPRANATIONAL INTERVENTION TO SAFEGUARD DEMO-CRATIC EU CORE VALUES.
804	THE ARTICLE IS AN ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THE RUSSIAN SCHOOL OF LAW FEATURES AND HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST CENTURY, CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRIORITY OF THE POSITIVIST THEORY OF LAW OVER THE NATURAL LAW APPROACH. IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHOR EXAMINES THE DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATION OF SUCH CONCEPTS AS 'RULE OF LAW,' 'RULE BY LAW' AND 'LAW-BOUND STATE' BY RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN LAWYERS AND CONCLUDES THAT THESE CONCEPTS ARE MIXED AND MISUNDERSTOOD. BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES OF INTERPRETATION, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MENTALITY NOT ONLY BETWEEN RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN LAWYERS, BUT ALSO BETWEEN LAWYERS IN RUSSIA: LAW ENFORCERS ON THE ONE HAND AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, ADVOCATES AND SOME INDEPENDENT SCIENTISTS ON THE OTHER AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THERE ARE SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR THE SPECIALIST SELECTION IN COMPETENT STATE BODIES. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DIFFERENCES OF INTERPRETATION, THE AUTHOR ANALYZES IN DETAIL THE DECISION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF MARCH 19, 2014, ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TREATY BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA ON THE ADMISSION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CRIMEA INTO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW SUBJECTS WITHIN THE LATTER.
805	THE RULE OF LAW ERA HAS GIVEN RISE TO MULTIPLE INDICATORS PURPORTING TO MEASURE THE CONCEPT. THIS ARTICLE COMPARES FOUR MAJOR INDICATORS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND SHOWS THAT THEIR APPROACHES TO CONCEPTUALIZATION AND MEASUREMENT DIFFER. GIVEN THEIR DISPARATE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS AND MEASUREMENT STRATEGIES, ONE MIGHT EXPECT A WEAK CORRELATION BETWEEN THEM. STRIKINGLY, HOWEVER, ALL FOUR INDICATORS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER (WITH THE PAIR-WISE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THREE OF THEM EXCEEDING 0.95). THEY ARE ALSO CORRELATED WITH THE WIDELY USED MEASURE OF CORRUPTION. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE INDICATORS MIGHT CAPTURE A MORE ENCOMPASSING CONCEPT, LIKE IMPARTIAL ADMINISTRATION. THE ARTICLE CRITIQUES THE RULE OF LAW MEASUREMENT ENTERPRISE AS INSUFFICIENTLY LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING NORMATIVE CONCEPT. IT POINTS TO THE RELIANCE ON EXPERT PERCEPTIONS AND INFORMATION CONSTRAINTS AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR THE CONVERGENCE. IT CONCLUDES THAT MEASUREMENT STRATEGY, RATHER THAN DIFFERENCES IN CONCEPTUALIZATION, EXPLAINS THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE INDICATORS.
806	THIS ARTICLE USES EMPIRICAL DATA TO ANALYSE THE MEANING OF RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS. IT COMPARES RULE OF LAW DATA ON CHINA, HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE FROM THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT AND FINDS PATTERNS OF MORE LIMITED PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND FEWER LIMITS ON GOVERNMENTAL POWERS. IT THEN USES GEERT HOFSTEDE'S CULTURAL DIMENSIONS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THOSE PATTERNS ARE RELATED TO COMMON CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT FINDS LOW SCORES ON THE CULTURAL VALUE OF INDIVIDUALISM IN THOSE THREE JURISDICTIONS ARE CORRELATED WITH LOWER PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS, AND THAT HIGH SCORES ON HOFSTEDE'S POWER DISTRIBUTION INDEX ARE INVERSELY CORRELATED WITH STRONG GOVERNMENTAL POWERS. IT CONCLUDES THAT RULE OF LAW WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS MEANS A VERSION OF RULE OF LAW WITH MORE LIMITED PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND WITH STRONG GOVERNMENTAL POWERS WITH FEWER LEGAL LIMITATIONS.
807	RECENT TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL LAW SCHOLARSHIP RECYCLE OBJECTIONS TO INTERNATIONAL LAW ADVANCED BY AN EARLIER GENERATION OF POLITICAL AND LEGAL REALISTS. SUCH OBJECTIONS FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE PLACE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE GLOBAL ORDER. TO UNDERSTAND THAT PLACE, WE MUST DISTINGUISH THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW FROM OTHER UNDERSTANDINGS OF LAW. THAT IDEA IS AN INHERENTLY MORAL ONE. THEORIES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT IGNORE THE MORAL ELEMENT IN LAW CANNOT DISTINGUISH LAW AS A CONSTRAINT ON POWER FROM LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POWER. A KANTIAN THEORY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CAN HELP TO RECOVER THAT MORAL ELEMENT.
808	THE INTERNET AND ITS WORLD WIDE WEB (WEB) HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS DECLARED ITS INTENTION TO OPEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN CHINA. PART OF THE COMMITMENT IS A COMMITMENT TO RULE OF LAW. RULE OF LAW ACCEPTABLE TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY AND DECISIONAL RATIONALITY. THESE TWO FEATURES CAN BE REALIZED MOST QUICKLY BY CONNECTING LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET'S WEB TO BODIES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW, THUS CREATING A VIRTUAL LIBRARY FOR CHINESE LEGAL DECISION MAKERS, AND USING THE WEB AS A QUICK AND CHEAP ELECTRONIC "PRINTING PRESS" FOR CHINESE LEGAL DECISION MAKERS. AS A RESULT, THEIR STATUTES, RULES, AND DECISIONAL LAW BECOME AVAILABLE TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS. BUT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ENOUGH. INNOVATIVE CROSS-CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AIMED AT THE LEGAL, MANAGERIAL, AND WEBMASTER PROFESSIONS WILL ROUND OUT THIS RULE OF LAW SUPPORT FOR COMMERCIAL GLOBALIZATION.
809	IN 2000, A GROUP OF AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS MOVED TO A FORMER WORLD WAR II ANTIAIRCRAFT PLATFORM IN THE NORTH SEA, SEVEN MILES OFF THE BRITISH COAST. THERE, THEY LAUNCHED HAVENCO, ONE OF THE STRANGEST START-UPS IN INTERNET HISTORY. A FORMER PIRATE RADIO BROADCASTER, ROY BATES, HAD OCCUPIED THE PLATFORM IN THE 1960S, MOVED HIS FAMILY ABOARD, AND DECLARED IT TO BE THE SOVEREIGN PRINCIPALITY OF SEALAND. HAVENCO'S FOUNDERS WERE OPPOSED TO GOVERNMENTAL CENSORSHIP AND CONTROL OF THE INTERNET; BY PUTTING COMPUTER SERVERS ON SEALAND, THEY PLANNED TO CREATE A "DATA HAVEN" FOR UNPOPULAR SPEECH, SAFELY BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY. THIS ARTICLE TELLS THE FULL STORY OF SEA/AND AND HAVENCO-AND EXAMINES WHAT THEY HAVE TO TELL US ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET. THE STORY ITSELF IS FASCINATING ENOUGH: IT INCLUDES PIRATE RADIO, SHOTGUNS, RAMPANT COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT, A RED BULL SKATEBOARDING SPECIAL, PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINES, AND THE MONTEVIDEO CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATE. BUT ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW ARE EVEN MORE REMARKABLE. PREVIOUS SCHOLARS HAVE SEEN HAVENCO AS A STRAIGHTFORWARD CHALLENGE TO THE RULE OF LAW: BY THREATENING TO UNDERMINE NATIONAL AUTHORITY, HAVENCO WAS OPPOSED TO ALL LAW. AS THE FULLER HISTORY SHOWS, THIS STORY IS TOO SIMPLISTIC. HAVENCO ALSO DEPENDED ON INTERNATIONAL LAW TO RECOGNIZE AND PROTECT SEA/AND, AND ON SEALAND LAW TO PROTECT IT FROM SEA/AND ITSELF WHERE OTHERS HAVE SEEN HAVENCO'S FAILURE AS THE TRIUMPH OF TRADITIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OVER HAVENCO, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT IN A VERY REAL SENSE, HAVENCO FAILED NOT FROM TOO MUCH LAW BUT FROM TOO LITTLE. THE "LAW" THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP HAVENCO SAFE WAS LAW ONLY IN A THIN, FORMALISTIC SENSE, DISCONNECTED FROM THE HUMAN INSTITUTIONS THAT MAKE AND ENFORCE LAW. BUT WITHOUT THOSE INSTITUTIONS, LAW DOES NOT WORK, AS HAVENCO DISCOVERED.
810	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS LITERATURE REGARDING THE NATURE AND IMPACT OF CORRUPTION AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO POVERTY IN AFRICA, EXPLAINS HOW THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT WOULD INVESTIGATE AND DETER CORRUPTION, AND RELATES THIS POLICY PROPOSAL TO CURRENT THEORIES OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THEORISTS AGREE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FIGHTING CORRUPTION BUT HAVE OVERLOOKED THE NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION TO CREATE A BODY OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS. THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES A DETAILED POLICY PROPOSAL AND AN ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIONS THAT MIGHT BE RAISED REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRONG INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY TO FIGHT CORRUPTION.
811	THE ARTICLE PROVES A LONG-LASTING LEGACY OF MARTIN KRYGIER'S WORK ON THE RULE OF LAW. TAKING THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A CASE STUDY, AND SPECIFICALLY-THE RECENT INFRINGEMENT ACTION CONCERNING THE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN POLAND, THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE POINT (TELEOS) OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE CONDITIONS THE INSTITUTIONS NEED TO FULFILL TO MAKE THIS POINT, AND INSTITUTIONAL MEASURES THAT HELP TO MEET THESE CONDITIONS IN THE EU AS A WHOLE AND ITS MEMBER STATES. IT ARGUES THAT THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE ACHIEVED VIA VARIOUS PATHS, BUT THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT ON WHEN ITS BASIC ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE GUARANTEES AGAINST ARBITRARY REMOVAL OF JUDGES ARE MISSING. THEREFORE, IT CONCLUDES, THE EU DOES NOT NEED TO DETERMINE THE ANATOMY OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT IT NEEDS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AGAINST SUCH MODIFICATIONS THAT PUT AT RISK THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EU LAW, AND THE JUDICIAL PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN PARTICULAR.
812	OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, THE RULE OF LAW HAS EMERGED AS A KEY PRIORITY WITHIN CONTEMPORARY PEACEBUILDING EFFORTS. DRAWING ON EXAMPLES FROM POST-DAYTON BOSNIA, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF RULE OF LAW REFORM EFFORTS ON BROADER PATTERNS OF POWER AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY IN PEACEBUILDING CONTEXTS. IT SUGGESTS THAT IN THE CASE OF BOSNIA, THE USE OF RULE OF LAW STRATEGIES TO RESTRUCTURE POLITICAL LIFE HAS LARGELY FAILED. THUS, DESPITE SOME NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE RULE OF LAW FRONT, THE CORE DYNAMICS OF BOSNIA'S POLITICAL CONFLICT REMAIN INTACT, AND COUNTRY'S PEACE PROCESS IS AS FRAGILE AS EVER. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY NOTING THAT CHARTING A COURSE BETWEEN ACCEPTING THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO AND FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMING IT REQUIRES MORE NUANCED APPROACHES THAT ADVANCE THE RULE OF LAW EVEN WHILE ACCEPTING ITS LIMITS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF DEEP POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION.
813	AS THE POLISH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES, POPULISTS CAN BECOME A GENUINE CHALLENGE FOR DEMOCRACY. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER AND HOW DEMOCRACY CAN DEFEND ITSELF WHEN A MAJORITY POPULIST GOVERNMENT HOLDS POWER. DATA ON INITIATIVES OPPOSING THE LAW AND JUSTICE GOVERNMENT BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020 SHOW THAT A 'PINCER MOVEMENT' OF OPPOSITION EMERGED. IT INVOLVED A COMBINATION OF INITIATIVES FROM INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC ACTORS, INCLUDING CIVIL SOCIETY AND EU ACTORS. YET WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT HOW THESE ACTORS INTERACT TO PUT PRESSURE ON POPULISTS IN POWER. BY USING THE CONCEPT OF EUROPEANISATION AND SOCIAL MOVEMENT THEORIES, WE ANALYSE HOW AND WHY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS REORIENTED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS IN POLAND AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL. WE ANALYSE NGOS' STRATEGIES AND ARGUE THAT THREE FACTORS HELP TO EXPLAIN THE EUROPEANISATION OF THE OPPOSITION TO POPULIST PARTY: THE CHANGING MULTI-LEVEL STRUCTURE OF OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS, THE CONSTRUCTION OF NATIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL COALITION FOR DEMOCRATIC DEFENCE AS WELL AS NGOS' COMMON PRO-EUROPEAN FRAME AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THE ARTICLE APPLIES A THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS BASED ON PRESS ARTICLES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH POLISH NGOS.
814	RULE OF LAW IS ONE OF THE MAIN COLUMNS, IF NOT THE FUNDAMENTAL, OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW SO ADHERENCE TO IT BY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AGENCIES WHILE EXERCISING THEIR DUTIES AND DEFINING PUBLIC POLICIES IS PIVOTAL IN THE CONCEPTION OF A LAWFUL STATE. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE ESSENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, ITS IMPORTANCE - AND THE CONSTITUTION'S- IN THE CONTEXT OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY AND HOW FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH IT HAS BEEN THE MAIN FACTOR BEHIND THE PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA OF VENEZUELAN'S LAW.
815	THIS CONTRIBUTION HONOURING PROF. MARTIN KRYGIER SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDES A BRIEF CRITICAL READING OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S JULY 2019 COMMUNICATION ON THE RULE OF LAW (COM(2019) 343 FINAL). IT ARGUES THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION'S EFFORT IS WELCOME, THE COMMUNICATION FAILS TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE CORE PROBLEM RELATED TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU, WHICH IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE IN THE ILLIBERAL REGIMES. THE FAILURE TO IDENTIFY THE CORE PROBLEM WITH UNEQUIVOCAL PRECISION AND SPELL OUT ITS KEY ELEMENTS AS WELL AS DISSECT ITS CAUSES UNDERMINES THE LIKELY EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TOOLS PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION TO ADDRESS THE UNNAMED AND UNANALYZED ON-GOING RULE OF LAW CONCERNS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMMUNICATION IS LACKING IN VITAL ESSENTIALS, IF NOT VACANT AT THE CORE.
816	THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW A CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW (EMBODIED IN A VARIETY OF LEGAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS) CAME TO AFFIRM ITSELF IN THE WORLD OF THE ANCIENT GREEK CITY STATES. IT ARGUES THAT SUCH A CONCEPTION, FORMULATED IN OPPOSITION TO THE ARBITRARY RULE OF MAN, WAS TO A LARGE EXTENT CONSISTENT WITH MODERN IDEAS OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A CONSTRAINT TO POLITICAL POWER, AND TO THEIR FULLERIAN REQUIREMENTS OF FORMAL LEGALITY, AS WELL AS TO REQUIREMENTS OF DUE PROCESS. THE ARTICLE THEN ANALYSES HOW THIS IDEAL WAS FORMULATED IN THE ARCHAIC PERIOD, AND HOW IT BECAME A KEY FEATURE OF GREEK IDENTITY. FINALLY, IT ARGUES THAT IN THE FIFTH AND FOURTH CENTURIES BCE IT CAME TO BE USED AS THE MEASURE OF THE LEGITIMACY OF GREEK POLITICAL SYSTEMS: DEMOCRACY AND OLIGARCHY, AS THEY ENGAGED IN AN IDEOLOGICAL BATTLE, WERE JUDGED AS LEGITIMATE (AND DESIRABLE) OR ILLEGITIMATE (AND UNDESIRABLE) ON THE BASIS OF THEIR CONFORMITY WITH A SHARED IDEAL OF THE RULE OF LAW. THEN AS NOW, TO QUOTE TAMANAHA, 'THE RULE OF LAW' WAS 'AN ACCEPTED MEASURE WORLDWIDE OF GOVERNMENT LEGITIMACY'.
817	THIS ARTICLE WILL FIRST DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL AND GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (SGBV) IN LIBERIA, ITS HISTORY TO VIEWS OF ITS CURRENT STATUS, AND THE DEBATE ABOUT ITS CAUSE. IT WILL DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS THAT RESULT THROUGH TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF SGBV THROUGH BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING BOTH TRADITIONAL AND CUSTOMARY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES WITHIN THE LIBERIAN SETTING. IT WILL ALSO DESCRIBE THE REASONING BEHIND THE CARTER CENTER (TCC'S) SUPPORT OF TRADITIONAL AND COMMUNITY-BASED PROJECTS, INCLUDING ITS USE OF NGO SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN HELPING IT MONITOR THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN FIGHTING SGBV. IT WILL BE A TALE OF DISCOURAGEMENT AS ASSESSMENT SHOWED THE CONTINUING PREVALENCE OF SGBV. NEXT THE PAPER WILL DISCUSS WHAT LED TCC TO DEVELOP ITS COMMUNITY JUSTICE ADVISOR (CJA) PROJECT. IT WILL DESCRIBE THE PROJECT AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. FINALLY IT WILL LOOK AT THE RESEARCH ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE CJA'S SUCCESS AND PREDICT WHETHER FUNDING OF ADDITIONAL CJAS WILL LIKELY BE EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING SGBV. IT WILL CONCLUDE BY MAKING SOME MODEST OBSERVATIONS ABOUT WHETHER CJAS MIGHT WORK ELSEWHERE IN AFRICA, OR IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, AND THE PROMISE AND DANGERS OF USING INDIVIDUAL PARALEGALS AS A MAJOR TOOL IN COMBATING SGBV.
818	IN HIS POLITICAL WRITINGS, F. A. HAYEK FACES A CLASSIC LIBERAL DILEMMA: HE OPPOSES COERCION BUT RECOGNIZES THAT SOMETIMES THE STATE CAN HELP TO MINIMIZE IT. HAYEK ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE THE DILEMMA OF THE LIMITS OF STATE POWER BY OFFERING A DEFINITION OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON A CONTROVERSIAL CONCEPTION OF RIGHTS. HOWEVER, HIS EFFORT TO FORMALIZE THE RULE OF LAW FAILS. NOT ONLY DOES HAYEK IMPLICITLY RELY ON AN UNDEFENDED THEORY OF RIGHTS, BUT HIS RULE-OF-LAW SCHEME IS LIMITED TO THE ELABORATION OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, NEGLECTING THE NEED FOR REFORMS AIMED DIRECTLY AT THE POLITICAL PROCESSES THAT RESULT IN THE CONTROVERSIAL FORMS OF COERCION HE DEPLORES.
819	GOVERNMENT UNDER LAW OR LAW UNDER GOVERNMENT? RULE OF LAW OR RULE BY LAW? THAT WAS THE HOTLY DEBATED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TOPIC IN CHINA DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. IN HER ARTICLE, "SHIFTING MEANINGS OF FAZHI AND CHINA'S JOURNEY TOWARD SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW", PROFESSOR YE GIVES US A CAREFUL AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS THAT INCLUDES THE DECISIVE OUTCOME REINFORCED BY CURRENT COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF XI JINPING. DRAWING UPON CHINA'S IMPERIAL TRADITIONS AND DICTATORIAL LEGALIST PHILOSOPHY, XI WIELDS LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE OFFICIAL POWER, ALTHOUGH IN PRACTICE HIS REPRESSION STRAYS INTO COMMUNIST LAWLESSNESS.
820	STARE DECISIS REMAINS A CONTROVERSIAL FEATURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT RECOGNIZE IT. SOME JURISTS ARGUE THAT THE DOCTRINE IS AT ODDS WITH THE RULE OF LAW; OTHERS ARGUE THAT THERE ARE GOOD RULE-OF-LAW ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF STARE DECISIS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS ONE POSSIBLE GOOD RULE-OF-LAW ARGUMENT. IT SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD APPROACH STARE DECISIS IN A LAYERED WAY, LOOKING AT WHAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES OF THE VARIOUS JUDGES INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRECEDENT. ONE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLE, THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSTANCY, COUNSELS AGAINST LIGHTLY OVERTURNING SUCH PRECEDENTS AS THERE ARE. BUT THAT IS NOT IN ITSELF AN ARGUMENT FOR STARE DECISIS SINCE IT PRESUPPOSES THAT PRECEDENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED. HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER PRINCIPLE, THE PRINCIPLE OF GENERALITY, WHICH REQUIRES ALL JUDGES TO BASE THEIR DECISIONS ON GENERAL NORMS AND NOT JUST LEAVE THEM AS FREESTANDING PARTICULARS. A THIRD PRINCIPLE, THE PRINCIPLE OF INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY, REQUIRES SUBSEQUENT JUDGES NOT TO GIVE THE LIE TO THE USE BY PRECEDENT JUDGES OF CERTAIN GENERAL NORMS TO DETERMINE THEIR DECISIONS. AND FINALLY, THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF FIDELITY TO LAW REQUIRES THE PRECEDENT JUDGE TO APPROACH HER DECISION AS FAR AS SHE CAN BY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE IMPLICIT BEARING OF SUCH EXISTING LAW AS THERE IS ON THE CASE IN FRONT OF HER TOGETHER THESE PRINCIPLES MAKE UP A LAYERED CASE-NOT AN ABSOLUTE CASE, BUT A STRONG AND PRODUCTIVE CASE-FOR STARE DECISIS.
821	IN 2015, LAW 12 LEGISLATED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FAMILY COURTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF KUWAIT. THE REFLECTIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF STAKEHOLDERS-JUDGES, LAWYERS, AND ADMINISTRATORS-SURROUNDING THIS LAW ARE HERE CONTEXTUALIZED FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES: (1) AS AN INSTITUTIONAL MEANS OF STRENGTHENING KUWAITI WOMEN'S CIVIL RIGHTS IN MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE AFTER WOMEN WERE GIVEN POLITICAL RIGHTS IN 2005; (2) AS PART OF WIDE-RANGING JURIDICAL REFORMS, INCLUDING THE PASSING OF THE LAW ON THE CHILD IN 2015, THE EXPANSION OF THE KUWAIT INSTITUTE FOR JUDICIAL AND LEGAL STUDIES' POWERS, AND THE CERTIFICATION OF GRADUATES FROM THE FACULTY OF SHARI'A AS LEGAL ADVISORS IN THE STATE APPARATUS AFTER 2012; AND (3) AS AN AVENUE FOR MANAGING RELIGIOUS PLURALISM IN A STATE WHERE ONE-THIRD OF THE CITIZENRY ARE SHIA MUSLIM. THE SUM OF THESE DIFFERENT REFORMS IN THE LEGAL SPHERE ARE ACTS OF GOVERNANCE THAT REFLECT ESTABLISHING RULE-OF-LAW GUIDELINES AS A MEANS OF CENTRALIZING POLITICAL AUTHORITY AND, BY EXTENSION, THE RULING AL SUBAH REGIME'S GRIP ON POWER FOLLOWING THE 2011 ARAB UPRISINGS.
822	GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE DEPLOYING AUTOMATION TOOLS IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT AFFECT RIGHTS AND ENTITLEMENTS. THE INTERESTS AFFECTED ARE VERY BROAD, RANGING FROM TIME SPENT IN DETENTION TO THE RECEIPT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSSES ON THE IMPACT ON RULE OF LAW VALUES OF AUTOMATION USING: (1) PRE-PROGRAMMED RULES (FOR EXAMPLE, EXPERT SYSTEMS); AND (2) PREDICTIVE INFERENCING WHEREBY RULES ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORIC DATA (SUCH BY APPLYING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING). THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE USE OF THESE SYSTEMS ACROSS A RANGE OF NATIONS. IT EXPLORES THE TENSION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND CONCLUDES WITH OBSERVATIONS ON HOW THE AUTOMATION OF GOVERNMENT DECISION-MAKING CAN BOTH ENHANCE AND DETRACT FROM RULE OF LAW VALUES.
823	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE ISSUES WITHIN A RULE OF LAW CONTEXT GENERALLY, AND IN UGANDA. THE ARTICLE DISCUSSES WHAT VIOLATIONS OCCURRED IN UGANDA, AND WHAT THE INTERRELATIONSHIP, AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS, OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IS TO THE RULE OF LAW IN THE COUNTRY. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT WHILE PROSECUTIONS ARE NOT FAVOURED IN UGANDA, IN ANY CASE THEY WILL BE DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE AMNESTIES ALREADY GRANTED, AND BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL RESISTANCE AND LACK OF POLITICAL WILL TO CARRY OUT PROSECUTIONS, ESPECIALLY AGAINST THOSE EMPLOYED BY THE STATE OR IN THE UGANDAN POLITICAL ARENA. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT THE RIGHT TO THE TRUTH IS NOW A NORM OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WHY VICTIMS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH AND WHY A TRUTH MECHANISM(S) SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. IT IS ARGUED THAT SUCH A PROCESS IS NECESSARY TO LEARN ABOUT WHAT OCCURRED, TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND TO RECOMMEND MECHANISMS TO TRY AND AVOID HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE FUTURE. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT PROMOTING RECONCILIATION AND PROVIDING REPARATIONS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE COUNTRY. THE NECESSITY OF A RECONCILIATION PROCESS IS EXAMINED, INCLUDING THE USE OF TRADITIONAL RECONCILIATION MEANS. ALSO DISCUSSED IS THE ESTABLISHMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF A REPARATIONS PROCESS. THE TYPE OF REPARATIONS INSTITUTION THAT OUGHT TO BE CREATED IS EXAMINED, AS ARE ISSUES SUCH AS THE PERIOD OF REFLECTION TO BE COVERED BY THE PROCESS, ISSUES CONCERNING OUTREACH, ACCESS AND THE TYPES AND FORM THAT REPARATIONS SHOULD TAKE.
824	RECENT CONTROVERSIES HAVE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NEGATIVE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY-THE AUTHORITY TO LIMIT OR UNDO WHAT CONGRESS HAS DONE THROUGH NONENFORCEMENT OR WAIVER. THIS SYMPOSIUM ESSAY REFLECTS IN SEVERAL WAYS ON CONSTITUTIONAL AND RULE-OF-LAW DEBATES THAT HAVE EMERGED REGARDING SUCH AUTHORITY. FIRST, IT DEFENDS THE RELEVANCE OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES TO BASELINE UNDERSTANDINGS OF NONENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. SECOND, IT IDENTIFIES A DEEP TENSION IN THE RULE OF LAW'S IMPLICATIONS FOR DISCRETIONARY ENFORCEMENT. THIRD, IT DEFENDS STATUTORILY CONFERRED LAW-CANCELLATION AUTHORITY AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES AND RULE-OF-LAW OBJECTIONS. FINALLY, IT PROPOSES PRESUMPTIVE LIMITS ON AUTHORITY TO CONDITION STATUTORY WAIVERS.
825	AS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) CELEBRATE 40 YEARS OF BILATERAL RELATIONS, THE PARTNERSHIP CONTINUES TO DEVELOP INTER ALIA WITH THE LAUNCH OF A NEW LEGAL AFFAIRS DIALOGUE, ANNOUNCED DURING THE 17TH EU-CHINA SUMMIT (JUNE 2015). AS RULE OF LAW APPROACHES GREATLY DIFFER BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE EU AND CONTAIN UNBRIDGEABLE CONCEPTUAL GAPS, THE NEW LEGAL AFFAIRS DIALOGUE MIGHT FURTHER CONTRIBUTE TO CHANGES IN THE EU'S STRATEGY OF EXTERNAL RULE OF LAW, FACED WITH THE PRC'S OWN NARRATIVE AND APPROACH TO THE RULE OF LAW. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NEW DIALOGUE MIGHT OFFER ROOM FOR AGREEMENT AND CONVERGENCE ON VARIOUS GLOBAL, BILATERAL AND DOMESTIC LEVELS. RECENT DOMESTIC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PRC AND A MANIFEST INTEREST IN REFORMING ITS LEGAL SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN THE EU IS ITSELF RE-THINKING ITS STRATEGY OF EXTERNAL RULE OF LAW OFFERS A GREAT POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT EXCHANGES AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRIDGE THE RULE OF LAW GAP BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE EU.
826	THESE DAYS THE RULE OF LAW IS OFTEN INVOKED IN BURMA. ALTHOUGH ITS CONTEMPORARY SALIENCE IS PARTLY A CONSEQUENCE OF RECENT GLOBAL TRENDS, THE RULE OF LAW ALSO HAS LINEAGES IN THE COUNTRY'S COLONIAL AND EARLY POST-COLONIAL PERIODS. TO EXAMINE THESE LINEAGES, THIS ARTICLE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN ITS PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTIONS. WHEREAS THE LATTER CONCEPTION RECOGNIZES THE SUBJECTS OF LAW AS FREELY ASSOCIATING EQUALS, THE FORMER IS COMPATIBLE WITH A RANGE OF POLITICAL PRACTICES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE UNDEMOCRATIC. THE RECORDS OF DECISIONS IN CRIMINAL CASES BEFORE BURMA'S SUPERIOR COURTS DURING THE PERIOD OF BRITISH DOMINATION SUGGEST THAT SOME SEMBLANCE OF PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW DID EXIST, AND THAT IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE RULE OF COLONIAL DIFFERENCE. OUT OF THIS PROCEDURAL RULE OF LAW A NASCENT, SUBSTANTIVE TYPE EMERGED DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC LIFE IN THE POST-COLONY, BEFORE THE ONSET OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT MORE EFFORT TO STRUCTURE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HISTORY MIGHT BETTER ENABLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CONCEPT'S CONTINUED RELEVANCE.
827	IN THE DECADES WHICH FOLLOWED THE PUBLICATION OF AV DICEY'S LAW OF THE CONSTITUTION, MOST ENGLISH LAWYERS FELT CONFIDENT THAT THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF ENGLISHMEN WERE PROTECTED BY A RULE OF LAW, WHICH WAS SECURED THROUGH ANCIENT COMMON LAW REMEDIES SUCH AS THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. IN THEIR VIEW, THIS ENSURED THAT NO POLITICAL ACTIVISTS WOULD BE DETAINED WITHOUT TRIAL, UNLESS THERE WERE PARTICULAR EMERGENCIES THAT ALLOWED THE WRIT'S SUSPENSION, IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE VERY RULE OF LAW. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THESE ARGUMENTS WERE BEING MADE, HOWEVER, DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL BECAME AN INCREASINGLY ROUTINE FEATURE OF COLONIAL GOVERNANCE. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ATTEMPTS USED BY POLITICAL DETAINEES FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EMPIRE TO CHALLENGE THEIR RENDITION AND DETENTION, AND EXPLORES WHAT THE JUDICIAL RESPONSE TELLS US ABOUT THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE ERA WHEN DICEY'S WORK WAS ESTABLISHING ITSELF AS THE CLASSIC TEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. FOCUSING ON A NUMBER OF KEY CASES, IT EXAMINES HOW COURTS EXAMINED TWO CENTRAL ISSUES IN HABEAS CORPUS CASES. THE FIRST CONCERNS THE LEGALITY OF THE DETENTION. IN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE, COURTS WERE PRESENTED WITH RIVAL APPROACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW, ONE WHICH WAS MORE 'FORMALIST' (ASKING WHETHER THE LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENT ORDERING THE DETENTION HAD A VALID PEDIGREE DERIVED FROM THE SOVEREIGN LEGISLATURE), AND ANOTHER WHICH WAS MORE 'SUBSTANTIVE' (INVOKING A NOTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS). THE SECOND CONCERNS THE QUESTION OF CONTROL, AND EXPLORES THE RESPONSE OF THE COURTS TO CHALLENGES TO THE WRIT BY DEFENDANTS WHO ARGUED THAT THEY NO LONGER HAD CONTROL OVER THE DETAINEE.
828	ALTHOUGH JOHANNES CHAN IS RARELY, IF EVER, THOUGHT OF AS A LEGAL THEORIST, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THERE IS IN FACT A MAJESTIC THEORETICAL EDIFICE OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT STANDS HUMBLY BEHIND HIS RICH LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP, WHICH SPANS ALMOST FOUR DECADES. DRAWING PRIMARILY ON HIS VOLUMINOUS WRITINGS FROM THE PERIOD AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION IN 1997, THIS ARTICLE SYSTEMATICALLY RECONSTRUCTS CHAN'S SUBSTANTIVE THEORY OF THE RULE OF LAW. THIS THEORY STANDS ON THE THREE PILLARS OF LEGALITY, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM, AND IS BUILT ON THE GROUNDWORK PRINCIPLES OF LEGAL PUBLICITY, CONSISTENCY, STABILITY, CERTAINTY, EQUALITY AND THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. THESE PRINCIPLES, AS THIS ARTICLE ARGUES, ARE ALL ULTIMATELY ROOTED IN A FUNDAMENTAL RESPECT FOR HUMAN DIGNITY. ONE MAY NOT AGREE WITH CHAN'S VIEWS IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BUT IT CAN HARDLY BE DENIED THAT HIS REMARKABLE CORPUS OF WORK RELATING TO THE RULE OF LAW WILL PROVOKE DEEP DISCUSSIONS AMONG LAW STUDENTS, LEGAL PRACTITIONERS AND JURISTS IN HONG KONG AND BEYOND IN THE DECADES TO COME.
829	TODAY, THE AUSTRIAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT LOOKS BACK ON AN EVENTFUL HISTORY. THE AUSTRIAN MODEL OF CONSTITUTIONAL ADJUDICATION ATTRACTED WIDE ATTENTION, IN PARTICULAR AFTER WORLD WAR II AND PROVED TO BE A SUCCESS STORY. CAREFULLY MANAGING BOTH THE INFLUENCES OF THE ECHR AND, MOST RECENTLY, THOSE OF EUROPEAN UNION LAW, THE COURT HAS BECOME AN ACTIVE PLAYER IN THE DIALOGUE OF THE COURTS INVOLVED.
830	WE ESTIMATE THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS, POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, OPENNESS, AND INCOME LEVELS, USING IDENTIFICATION THROUGH HETEROSKEDASTICITY (IH). WE SPLIT OUR CROSS-NATIONAL DATASET INTO TWO SUB-SAMPLES: (I) COLONIES VERSUS NON-COLONIES; AND (II) CONTINENTS ALIGNED ON AN EAST-WEST VERSUS THOSE ALIGNED ON A NORTH-SOUTH AXIS. WE EXPLOIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STRUCTURAL VARIANCES IN THESE TWO SUB-SAMPLES TO GAIN IDENTIFICATION. WE FIND THAT DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE BOTH GOOD FOR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, BUT THE LATTER HAS A MUCH STRONGER IMPACT ON INCOMES. OPENNESS (TRADE/GDP) HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INCOME LEVELS AND DEMOCRACY, BUT A POSITIVE EFFECT ON RULE OF LAW. HIGHER INCOME PRODUCES GREATER OPENNESS AND BETTER INSTITUTIONS, BUT THESE EFFECTS ARE NOT VERY STRONG. RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY TEND TO BE MUTUALLY REINFORCING.
831	THERE IS A GENERAL BELIEF THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS A GUARANTOR OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS. HOWEVER, IN THE VICTORIA LAW FOUNDATION ORATION FOR 2017, THE HON ROBERT FRENCH AC EXPLORED WHETHER RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS COULD BE ERODED BY THE SYSTEM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTING THEM.
832	ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE FUNDAMENTAL AND INDISPENSABLE ELEMENTS OF DEMOCRACY. THE LEGITIMACY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE COLLECTION AND SPENDING OF PUBLIC FINANCES IS A SINE QUA NON OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. TO ENSURE THIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AND FIND SPECIALIZED MECHANISMS THAT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE CONTROL AND PREVENT POSSIBLE ABUSE OF POWER. THESE MECHANISMS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND MOST COUNTRIES HAVE DESIGNED THE INSTITUTION OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL AS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. THIS INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISM ENSURES FINANCIAL AND LEGAL CONTROL AS WELL AS A PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL IN KOSOVO, DISCUSSES THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ITS RELATION WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT, AND ALSO EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS IN IMPLEMENTING ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN THE FUTURE.
833	THIS ESSAY OFFERS A SPECIFICATION OF THE RULE OF LAW'S DEMANDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND GOVERNMENT INSPIRED BY PROFESSOR PETER L. STRAUSS'S SCHOLARSHIP. IT IDENTIFIES FIVE PRINCIPLES AUTHORIZATION, NOTICE, JUSTIFICATION, COHERENCE, AND PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS WHICH PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR AN ACCOUNT OF THE RULE OF LAW'S DEMANDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNANCE. TOGETHER THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE INTRIGUING RESULTS FOR THE EVALUATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. ON THE ONE HAND, THEY REVEAL RULE-OF-LAW FOUNDATIONS FOR SOME CONTESTED POSITIONS, SUCH AS A RESTRICTIVE VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO DIRECT SUBORDINATE OFFICIALS AND GIVING WEIGHT TO AN AGENCY'S DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OF ITS OWN AUTHORITY. ON THE OTHER HAND, THESE RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES EXPOSE SOME LONG-ESTABLISHED PRACTICES AS HAVING TROUBLESOME FOUNDATIONS, SUCH AS THE SETTLED DOCTRINE THAT AGENCIES NEED NOT JUSTIFY THEIR CHOICE OF POLICYMAKING FORM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES IN THE CONTEXT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY SHOWS LIKE SO MUCH OF PROFESSOR STRAUSS'S WORK THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH GOVERNMENT UNDER LAW ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON OFFICIALS TAKING THE RULE OF LAW AS THEIR HIGHEST-ORDER COMMITMENT.
834	IN THIS ARTICLE, JUSTICE PALMER OUTLINES A DESCRIPTIVE CONCEPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DIALOGUE. IT IS ENRICHED BY FOCUSING ON WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL IN REALITY AND IN CONSIDERING HOW LOUDLY, AND IN WHAT LANGUAGES, THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE. AS A NORMATIVE MATTER, HE SUGGESTS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE RULE OF LAW THAT THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT SPEAK IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND HAVE SYSTEMICALLY. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. OTHERWISE, IT WOULD NOT BE THE LAW WHICH RULES; IT WOULD BE THE "RULING" CULTURE.
835	THE RULE OF LAW IS A WIDELY USED TERM IN SCHOLARSHIP ON OTTOMAN LEGAL REFORMS. NEVERTHELESS, THE ACTUAL MEANING OF THIS NOTION IS RARELY CLARIFIED IN THE WRITING ON THE LATE OTTOMAN EMPIRE ALTHOUGH THEORISTS OF LAW HAVE DISCUSSED THE AMBIGUITY OF THIS TERM. THIS ARTICLE AIMS AT EXAMINING THE VALUE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS AN ANALYTICAL CATEGORY WHEN DISCUSSING SOCIO-LEGAL CHANGE IN THE LATE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. THE ARTICLE DEMONSTRATES THAT THE RULE OF LAW CAN BE A MEANINGFUL CATEGORY FOR HISTORICAL ANALYSIS WHEN CONCEIVED THROUGH A 'CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE' TO THE LAW.
836	THE PRESENT TEXT EXPLORES FOUR THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO CONTEMPORARY DEMOCRACY AS WELL AS THE CRITIQUES THAT ARE FORMULATED FROM THE MOST RECENT AUTHORS TO EACH ONE OF THEM, ESPECIALLY FROM THE AGONISTIC MODEL. THESE THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE TAKEN AS REFERENCES TO ANALYZE THE TENSION IN THE COLOMBIAN POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEM AROUND POPULAR CONSULTATIONS ON THE ADJUDICATION OF MINING TITLE TO DEAL WITH THIS SCENARIO, THE EMBLEMATIC CASE OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF CAJAMARCA WILL BE TAKEN AS A REFERENCE. THE ARTICLE IS THE PRODUCT OF A THEORETICAL-DEDUCTIVE ANALYSIS, IN WHICH DOCUMENTARY SOURCES ARE ANALYZED BASED ON CRITICAL HERMENEUTICS. THE MAIN RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE CAJAMARCA CASE IS TO INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TENSION RAISED FROM THE THEORY BY THE APPROACHES OF AGONISTIC DEMOCRACY AND THE CRITICISMS OF THE LIBERAL MODELS OF FORMAL DEMOCRACY
837	AS A SOCIAL NORM, LAW IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED IN THE FORM OF POSITIVE LAW BY COLLECTING OPINIONS OF PEOPLE. IN ORDER FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO BE PROPERLY PRACTICED IN A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY, THE DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS REQUIRES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE, EXECUTIVE, AND JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE CONSOLIDATED IN A SINGLE BODY. HOWEVER, EVEN WITHIN A PERFECTLY ESTABLISHED LEGISLATIVE SYSTEM, THE PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW MAY BE DISTORTED DEPENDING ON THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE KOREAN JUDICIARY SHOWS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT ORGAN OF THE LAWMAKING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND THE LAW-ENFORCING EXECUTIVE BRANCH; IT WOULD FAIL TO PROPERLY GIVE EFFECT TO THE COUNTRY'S GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT MAY BE THOUGHT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS LIE IN THE ENDEMIC TENDENCY TOWARDS THE RULE OF MAN IN EAST ASIAN SOCIETIES. NOWADAYS, THOSE WHO RECEIVED EDUCATION IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THE AUTHORITARIANISM HAVE BEGUN TO MAKE INROADS INTO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THEY CAN BE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO PREVENT FREEDOM AND RIGHTS OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON FROM BEING INFRINGED UPON. IN THIS WAY, THEY CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE JUDICIARY HAS FULFILLED ITS ROLES IN SHAPING A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY WHERE THE RULE OF LAW IS EXERCISED PROPERLY AS A GOVERNING PRINCIPLE.
838	CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE IN LAST DECADES FACED SEVERAL OBSTACLES TO ESTABLISH FULL-FUNCTIONING LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE STUDIES THE IMPACT OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE BY EXAMINING REASONS FOR HIGH NUMBER OF JUDGEMENTS FINDING VIOLATIONS AND DIFFICULTIES IN EXECUTING JUDGEMENTS IN SEVERAL OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE STATES. IT ANALYSES THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE AND ASKS WHETHER ITS JUDGEMENTS HAVE PROVIDED FUNDAMENTAL STANDARDS IN THE KEY DIMENSIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. IT DOES SO BY ESTABLISHING THE QUADRUPLE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF THE RULE OF LAW COMPOSED OF: DEALING WITH THE PAST VIOLATIONS; THE INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIALITY AND FAIRNESS OF JUDICIARY; PLURALISM, BROADMINDEDNESS AND TOLERANCE; AND PROTECTIONS UNDER THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND THE PROHIBITION ON TORTURE, INHUMANE AND DEGRADING TREATMENT. CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES HAVE IN LAST DECADES ATTEMPTED TO TRANSLATE THE RULE OF LAW DE IURE WITHIN GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS AND BEYOND. THEY HAVE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO INTERNALISE THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. EQUIPPED WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW DE IURE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, HOWEVER ITS IMPACT ON THE RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN IN PRACTICE LIMITED DUE TO INSTITUTIONAL AND POLICY LIMITATIONS AND WIDE-SPREAD CONUNDRUMS RELATING TO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, WEAK INSTITUTIONS AND CORRUPTION. THEREFORE ITS VALUES HAVE YET TO BE INTERNALISED FULLY IN DOMESTIC SETTINGS.
839	THE RULE OF LAW EMPHASISES THAT ALL LAWS HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED VIA APPROPRIATE MEDIA, EQUALLY AND FAIRLY ADMINISTERED, AND EFFECTIVELY ENFORCED. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT DECISION MAKERS AND ADMINISTRATORS FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW WHEN MAKING DECISIONS. UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, STATES HAVE A DUTY TO ADOPT VARIOUS RULES AND MEASURES TO PREVENT, REDUCE, AND CONTROL POLLUTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT RESULTING FROM MARINE ACTIVITIES. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS DUTY BY STATES IS EVALUATED BY COMPETENT INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS OR THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCES. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, THE 8TH OCEAN LAW AND GOVERNANCE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WITH A THEME ENTITLED 'RULE OF LAW AND THE LAW OF THE SEA', WAS HELD ON JUNE 27TH-28TH IN DALIAN, CHINA. THIS BRIEF CONFERENCE REPORT PROVIDES DETAILS OF THE KEY ISSUES DISCUSSED DURING THE CONFERENCE WHICH MAY HELP STRENGTHEN BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN PROMOTING GOOD OCEAN GOVERNANCE.
840	IS IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY SOME FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT CAN BE GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY ALL STATES? CAN SUCH CORE ELEMENTS REACH A NORMATIVE THRESHOLD TO BE CONSIDERED REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN "VALUES" OR "VIRTUES" ? AND FINALLY, WHAT ARE THESE CORE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW? THIS CONTRIBUTION PROPOSITIONS THAT, INDEED, SUCH CORE ELEMENTS EXIST, IDENTIFIES THEM-NON-ARBITRARINESS, CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY-FROM THE PRACTICE OF STATES AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL AND CONCEPTUALISES THEM AS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF STATEMENTS OF GOVERNMENTS AT THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) DURING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD (2012-2017), ACCOMPANYING THE RELEVANT FINDINGS WITH REFERENCES TO DECISIONS AND OPINIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ).
841	IN LIGHT OF EXAMPLES OF GOVERNMENT ACTION TO CIRCUMVENT COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAWS, BY EXECUTIVE FIAT OR LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENT, THIS ARTICLE TAKES A TIMELY LOOK AT THE ENDURING IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW. FORMULATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW FALL INTO FORMAL AND SUBSTANTIVE VERSIONS. FORMAL VERSIONS INCLUDE: RULE BY LAW, FORMAL LEGALITY AND LEGALITY WITH DEMOCRACY. IN ITS MOST FORMAL SENSE (RULE BY LAW), THE RULE OF LAW INVOLVES TWO COMPONENTS: THE GOVERNMENT MUST ABIDE BY CURRENTLY VALID LAW AND THE GOVERNMENT MAY ONLY CHANGE LAW WITHIN THE LEGAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE LAW MAKING POWER. THE FORMAL LEGALITY CONCEPTION GOES FURTHER AND RECOGNISES THAT, IN ORDER FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO BE REALISED, THE LAW MUST CONFORM TO CERTAIN STANDARDS, INCLUDING CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY; THERE MUST BE ADEQUATE MACHINERY TO ENFORCE THE LAW, INCLUDING AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIARY; AND THERE MUST BE CONGRUENCE BETWEEN ACTION AND THE LAW. FORMAL LEGALITY AND DEMOCRACY FURTHER PRESCRIBES THE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURE BY WHICH THE CONTENT OF THE LAW IS DETERMINED. SUBSTANTIVE FORMULATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW INCORPORATE THE FORMAL REQUIREMENTS OF FORMAL VERSIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW BUT ADD REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE LAW. THESE INCLUDE HUMAN RIGHTS. SUBSTANTIVE FORMULATIONS ARE MORE CONTROVERSIAL. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT, DESPITE ITS ELUSIVE MEANING, THE RULE OF LAW SERVES AS AN ANCHOR IN THE SWIRLING CURRENTS OF CHANGE.
842	THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COHERENT EU RULE OF LAW EXTERNAL ACTION STRATEGY REQUIRES THAT THE UNION OVERCOME TWO "DIVERSITY DILEMMAS" AND ONE "CONSISTENCY DILEMMA." THE THREE DILEMMAS ARE INTERRELATED AND OUGHT TO BE APPROACHED HOLISTICALLY. THE FIRST DIVERSITY DILEMMA PERTAINS TO THE GREAT DIVERGENCE IN THE CURRENT USES AND UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND EMANATES FROM EMPIRICAL REALITY, RATHER THAN CONCEPTUAL CHALLENGE. IN THE CONTEMPORARY GLOBAL SYSTEM, THE EU FACES A BROAD, POSSIBLY WIDENING, SET OF POLITICAL REGIMES WHICH POSE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES. A MEANINGFUL RULE OF LAW EXTERNAL ACTION STRATEGY THEREFORE CANNOT BE BASED ON UNIFORMITY OF CONCEPTUALIZATION OR POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS BUT MUST CONTEND SQUARELY WITH A REALITY OF GREAT, AND ARGUABLY GROWING, VARIANCE. GRAPPLING WITH DIVERSITY WHILE MAINTAINING CONCEPTUAL AND POLICY COHERENCE REPRESENTS THE THIRD KEY CHALLENGE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COHERENT EU RULE OF LAW EXTERNAL ACTION STRATEGY. RESOLVING THE CONSISTENCY DILEMMA NECESSITATES ACCOMMODATING DIVERSITY WITHIN A COHERENT CONCEPTUAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK. THIS, IN TURN, REQUIRES THAT, IN ITS EXTERNAL ACTION, THE EU APPROACH THE RULE OF LAW AS A CENTRAL PILLAR OF A BROADER, LIBERAL POLITICAL-DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND THAT IT ADOPTS A VERTICAL (RATHER THAN THE TRADITIONAL HORIZONTAL) UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT, INVOLVING BROADLY PROGRESSIVE, CUMULATIVE, AND HIERARCHICAL SPHERES OF RULE OF LAW CONDITIONS.
843	RULE OF LAW - CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE - MEANING - SCOPE OF APPLICATION - JUSTICIABILITY - AUDIT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK - LISBON TREATY
844	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE RELATION BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW, THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN PERU. THIS THEME IS UNAVOIDABLE SINCE MOST CONTEMPORARY WORKS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE (DISCUSSING AND EVALUATING THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF REGIMES) ACKNOWLEDGE THE PREVAILING ROLE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM - EFFECTIVENESS, CONSISTENCY, EQUAL PROTECTION, CAPACITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW - ON THE TRAJECTORY OF REGIMES (O'DONNELL 2004; MORLINO AND DIAMOND 2005; LEVINE AND MOLINA 2007). THE FIRST SECTION OF THE PRESENT WORK CONSIDERS THE MERITS OF A POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LAW AND LAWS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THEIR IMPACT ON SOCIETY. THE SECOND SECTION PRESENTS AND INTERROGATES DIVERSE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CONCEPT RULE OF LAW IN THE FIELDS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. THIS SECTION ALSO OPENS A DISCUSSION OF APPROACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW AND TO THE FUNCTIONING OF DEMOCRATIC REGIMES. THE THIRD AND FINAL SECTION ADDRESSES THE LEGAL SITUATION IN CONTEMPORARY PERU.
845	WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY REMOVING EXISTING CONSTRAINTS ON THE ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR OF WOMEN, ASSUMING THESE CHANGES ARE THEN ENFORCED. WE EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN'S POLITICAL POWER AND A COUNTRY'S RULE OF LAW WITH WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY, USING THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR DATASET COMBINED WITH OTHER INDICATORS. BOTH VARIABLES ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH WOMEN'S ENTRY INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT. ENTRY INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS MODERATED BY RULE OF LAW, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF WOMEN'S POLITICAL POWER HAVING GREATER EFFECTS IN COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF RULE OF LAW. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.
846	ATHEISTS ARE DISTRUSTED IN SOCIETIES WITH RELIGIOUS MAJORITIES. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE UNDERLYING REASONS FOR THIS PHENOMENON. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT DISTRUST OF ATHEISTS IS IN PART THE RESULT OF BELIEVERS THINKING THAT BEING UNDER SUPERNATURAL SURVEILLANCE BY A WATCHFUL GOD UNDERLIES MORAL BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, SECULAR RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS POLICE, JUDGES, AND COURTS, ARE ALSO POTENT SOURCES OF PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE PRESENCE OF SUCH SECULAR AUTHORITY THEREFORE COULD REPLACE RELIGION'S PROSOCIAL ROLE AND ERODE BELIEVERS' REJECTION OF ATHEISTS. IN TWO COMPLEMENTARY CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSES, WE FOUND SUPPORT FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS: BELIEVERS FROM COUNTRIES WITH A STRONG SECULAR RULE OF LAW SHOWED MARKEDLY REDUCED POLITICAL INTOLERANCE OF ATHEISTS COMPARED TO BELIEVERS FROM COUNTRIES WITH A WEAK SECULAR RULE OF LAW. THIS RELATIONSHIP REMAINED STRONG AFTER CONTROLLING FOR INDIVIDUAL DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SEVERAL COUNTRY-LEVEL SOCIO-ECONOMIC PREDICTORS OF ATHEIST DISTRUST, SUCH AS HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, INDIVIDUALISM, RELIGIOUS INVOLVEMENT, AND DISTRUST OF PEOPLE IN GENERAL.
847	TYPICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE ABILITY OF SOCIAL NETWORKS TO ENABLE COLLECTIVE ACTION FOCUS ON EITHER WHOLE GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL ADVANTAGES. ADDING AN INTERMEDIATE PERSPECTIVE, THIS PAPER ADVANCES A CORE NOTION OF STRATEGIC EMBEDDEDNESS THAT APPLIES TO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS INVOLVING A SUBSET OF SOCIETY. STRATEGIC EMBEDDEDNESS IS MODELED WITH A GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH THAT PLACES AN OTHERWISE ISOLATED GAME INTO A BROADER SOCIAL STRUCTURE. TO FACILITATE A COMPARATIVE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL MECHANISMS, THIS PAPER ADVANCES A COMPLEMENTARY NOTION OF THE COOPERATIVE VALUE OF A NETWORK TO EVALUATE THE MAXIMUM PAYOFFS POSSIBLE UNDER VARIOUS NETWORK STRUCTURES THAT DEFINE THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF TWO-PERSON COOPERATION GAMES. A FORMAL ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT DECENTRALIZED NETWORK STRUCTURES CAN MAXIMIZE THIS COOPERATIVE VALUE: UNDER SOME CONDITIONS, THESE ARE BOTH OPTIMAL AND EFFICIENT STRUCTURES THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY SUBSTITUTE FOR ANONYMOUS PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. IN CONDITIONS WHERE PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT IS RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE VIS-A-VIS A PUBLIC RULE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM, THEN HIERARCHICAL NETWORK STRUCTURES ARE SHOWN TO BE OPTIMAL BUT INEFFICIENT. IN GENERAL, MORE CONNECTEDNESS OR A HIGHER NETWORK DENSITY DOES NOT READILY TRANSLATE INTO MORE COOPERATION BECAUSE WHEN MOST PLAYERS ARE CONNECTED TO THE REST OF SOCIETY, THE ADDED VALUE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS DIMINISHES IN THE ABSENCE OF EXTRANEOUS RULES TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG PLAYERS WITH COMMON SOCIAL CONNECTIONS.
848	DEVELOPING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA HAS BECOME A GOAL OF HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP) IN RECENT YEARS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE REASONS FOR CHINA'S HIGH LEVEL OF CONCERN WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AND FOCUSES ON ITS ROLE IN FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO WTO ACCESSION. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE CONCERN OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA IS DRIVEN BY THE COUNTRY'S RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S AND THE CCP'S POSITIONS AT THE CENTRE OF POWER IN THE COUNTRY.
849	WHETHER ORDINARY PEOPLE SUPPORT THE RULE OF LAW AND HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF THE SUCCESSFUL CONSOLIDATION OF A DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION. ACCORDINGLY, WE INVESTIGATE HERE BASIC ATTITUDES TOWARDS LAW AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE SOUTH AFRICAN POLITICAL CULTURE. EASED ON A 1996 SURVEY OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN MASS PUBLIC, WE DISCOVER THAT SUPPORT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT PARTICULARLY COMMON IN SOUTH AFRICA, ALTHOUGH RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES ARE SUBSTANTIAL. CONFIDENCE IN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, HOWEVER, IS INDEPENDENT OF ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE WE DISCOVER LITTLE RESIDUE OF EXPERIENCES WITH APARTHEID IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE RULE OF LAW, WE CONCLUDE THAT DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IN SOUTH AFRICA WOULD BE SERVED BY AN INCREASE IN COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW AMONG AFRICANS AND AN INCREASE IN CONFIDENCE IN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AMONG WHITES, COLOURED PEOPLE, AND SOUTH AFRICANS OF ASIAN ORIGIN.
850	THE SPOUSAL SUPPORT ADVISORY GUIDELINES FACILITATE DISCRETIONARY SPOUSAL SUPPORT DETERMINATIONS UNDER THE DIVORCE ACT. NON-BINDING IN NATURE, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO RESTORE SOME TRANSPARENCY TO AN UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE REMEDY AND TO BENEFIT DEPENDENT SPOUSES WHO MIGHT PREVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN DETERRED FROM CLAIMING SUPPORT. THEY MAY THUS BE SEEN AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR ADVANCING ECONOMIC JUSTICE AT FAMILY BREAKDOWN AND PROMOTING SUBSTANTIVE ECONOMIC GENDER EQUALITY. SEVERAL CANADIAN APPELLATE COURTS HAVE ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSED THEM. OTHERS OBJECT TO THEIR APPLICATION, GROUNDING THEIR RESISTANCE IN THEIR UNOFFICIAL AND NON-BINDING CHARACTER. THIS ARTICLE RESPONDS TO THAT OBJECTION, BASED ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE RULE OF LAW. DRAWING ON LITERATURE IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, AND POLITICAL SCIENCE, I SUGGEST THAT JUDICIAL RELIANCE ON THE SPOUSAL SUPPORT ADVISORY GUIDELINES DOES NOT OFFEND THE RULE OF LAW. INSTEAD OF THE NARROW AND FORMALISTIC PRINCIPLE SET OUT BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA, ADOPTING A THICKER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW, GROUNDED IN PARTICIPATION AND DELIBERATION, IMBUES THE ADVISORY GUIDELINES WITH NORMATIVE FORCE AND AFFIRMS THE LEGITIMACY OF JUDICIAL RELIANCE ON THEM.
851	THE 1996 SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION TRANSFORMED MUNICIPALITIES FROM CREATURES OF STATUTE INTO AN INTERDEPENDENT SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT, THEREBY ENABLING SOUTH AFRICAN CITIES TO CARVE OUT A SPACE FOR AUTONOMOUS URBAN GOVERNANCE, WHICH IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRESSIVE REALISATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS HOW SOUTH AFRICAN COURTS HAVE DEPLOYED, RECONFIGURED AND CHANNELLED THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS DISPUTES, DISPUTES CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENTAL OBLIGATIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS DISPUTES, IN ORDER TO FORTIFY URBAN AUTONOMY, TO SUBSTANTIVELY GUIDE ITS EXERCISE AND TO ENSURE DYNAMIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR URBAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' ROLE IN ENSURING THE PROGRESSIVE REALISATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RIGHTS.
852	THE ARTICLE ANALYSES NIKITA MIKHALKOV'S FILM 12 (2007), A REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC AMERICAN TWELVE ANGRY MEN BY SIDNEY LUMET (1957). LUMET'S FILM ASSERTS THE RULE OF LAW OVER ILLEGAL RETALIATION, CHAUVINISM AND EMOTIONAL JUDGEMENT. THOUGH MIKHALKOV'S VERSION USES THE SETTING AND THE PLOT OF THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION, ITS ULTIMATE CONCLUSION IS THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ALWAYS AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER TO RUSSIA'S TROUBLED SOCIETY. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES HOW MIKHALKOV REMADE THE CLASSIC COURTROOM DRAMA INTO A PREQUEL FOR A REVENGE GENRE FILM.
853	THROUGHOUT THE PAST TWO DECADES, THE DEMAND FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE INDICATORS TO QUANTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. THESE INDICATORS SEEK TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF POLICYMAKING AND PUBLIC AUDIENCES BY OPERATIONALIZING(1) SUCH COMPLEX, MULTI-DIMENSIONAL CONCEPTS AS GOVERNANCE, ACCESS TO JUSTICE, CORRUPTION, AND THE RULE OF LAW, TO NAME A FEW.(2) THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS HAS LED TO A PROLIFERATION OF INDICES. THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE HAGUE JOURNAL ON THE RULE OF LAW, ENTIRELY DEDICATED TO MEASUREMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS ACROSS COUNTRIES, REPRESENTS THE OUTCOME OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE HAGUE INSTITUTE FOR THE INTERNATIONALISATION OF LAW (HIIL) AND THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT (WJP). IN AUGUST 2010, THESE INSTITUTIONS CONVENED IN WASHINGTON, DC, A SEMINAR WITH SOME OF THE LEADING RESEARCHERS AND INDICATOR DEVELOPERS IN THE FIELDS OF GOVERNANCE, CORRUPTION, AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THE GOAL OF THE SEMINAR WAS TO FACILITATE AN OPEN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR, AND THE LIMITATIONS OF, CROSS-COUNTRY INSTITUTIONAL INDICATORS. PRESENTATIONS MADE AT THIS SEMINAR HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO PAPERS FOR THIS SPECIAL ISSUE.(3)
854	COMPASSION POSES DIFFICULT CHALLENGES FOR THE RULE OF LAW. THE COMPASSIONATE RESPONSE IS OFTEN CAST AS A DEVIATION FROM SETTLED LAW RATHER THAN A PRINCIPLED APPLICATION OF IT. COMPASSION SO UNDERSTOOD IS TROUBLING, MOST OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT POSES A CHALLENGE TO OVERALL FAIRNESS, NOTICE AND CONSISTENCY. ALTHOUGH COMPASSION IS USUALLY APPROACHED AS A FACTOR INFLUENCING SUBSTANTIVE OUTCOMES, I ARGUE TO THE CONTRARY THAT COMPASSION CANNOT SERVE AS A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF WHO SHOULD PREVAIL IN LEGAL DEBATES. WHETHER COMPASSION SHOULD INFORM SUBSTANCE IS A NORMATIVE QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED IN LIGHT OF THE PURPOSES OF THE TRIBUNAL AND THE PRINCIPLES IT SEEKS TO ADVANCE. I PROPOSE INSTEAD THAT COMPASSION'S IMPORTANCE LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO AID DECISION-MAKERS IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THE LITIGANT. IN THIS SENSE, COMPASSION IS CLOSELY TIED TO HUMILITY: BOTH ARE REMINDERS OF HUMAN FALLIBILITY AND OF THE LIMITS OF INDIVIDUAL UNDERSTANDING.
855	JUSTICE BEAZLEY WAS INVITED TO GIVE A KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE WORLD BAR CONFERENCE 2014 CENTRED ON THE THEME OF "ADVOCATES AS PROTECTORS OF THE RULE OF LAW". CONFRONTED BY THE BREADTH OF DISCOURSE ON THE RULE OF LAW, WE WERE INTERESTED TO EXAMINE WHETHER OUR LEGAL SYSTEMS' COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW WAS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL; WHETHER, TO USE THE ANALOGY OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN'S FAIRY TALE, THE CLOTH WE WEAR IS REALLY WOVEN WITH GOLD. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THAT QUESTION OF COMPLIANCE BY REFERENCE TO DISCRETION IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, A SUBJECT THAT HAS RECEIVED FREQUENT ATTENTION BY THE HIGH COURT OF AUSTRALIA IN RECENT YEARS. IDENTIFYING DISCRETION AS PLAYING A CENTRAL BUT COMPLEX ROLE IN THE RULE OF LAW, THE IMPORTANCE AND RULE OF LAW CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTENT AND ALLOCATION OF DISCRETION IN, AND BETWEEN, THE POLICE FORCE, PROSECUTORS AND THE JUDICIARY IS EXAMINED. THIS ISSUE IS EXPLORED BY REFERENCE TO TWO AREAS OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM: FIRST, THE OFFENCE OF CONSORTING IN THE CRIMES ACT 1900 (NSW), S 93X WHICH, AT THE TIME THE SPEECH WAS GIVEN, WAS THE SUBJECT OF A RESERVED HIGH COURT DECISION ON ITS CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY; AND, SECONDLY, THE INTRODUCTION OF AGGRAVATED FORMS OF EXISTING OFFENCES WHICH ARE COUPLED WITH MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES WHICH WERE CONSIDERED BY THE HIGH COURT IN MAGAMING V THE QUEEN (2013) 87 ALJR 1060; [2013] HCA 40.
856	MANY PEOPLE MUST BE WONDERING HOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT POLAND, NOT SO LONG AGO HAILED FOR ITS EXEMPLARY TRANSITION FROM A COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP TO A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY, COULD HAVE SO SWIFTLY DESCENDED INTO AUTHORITARIANISM VIA A CRISIS IN THE RULE OF LAW. THE MAJORITY OF COMMENTATORS POINT TO THE SIZE AND FEROCITY OF THE ATTACK ON THOSE MECHANISMS MEANT TO SAFEGUARD THE RULE OF LAW, WHEREAS FEW FOCUS ON THE WEAKNESS OF THEIR DEFENCE. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO REDRESS THAT IMBALANCE. THE CRUCIAL FACTS OF THE POLISH CRISIS ARE FIRST PRESENTED, AND THE NATURE OF BOTH THE ATTACKS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN POLAND AND THE MEASURES TAKEN IN ITS DEFENCE ARE THEN PRESENTED. IN DESCRIBING THEIR DEFENCE, THIS ARTICLE NOT ONLY DRAWS ON NICHOLAS BARBER'S CONCEPT OF THE SELF-DEFENCE OF INSTITUTIONS, BUT ATTEMPTS TO IMPROVE UPON IT IN THE LIGHT OF THE POLISH CRISIS. FURTHER IN THE ARTICLE, I ARGUE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ASSAULT ON THE RULE OF LAW IS THE FORMALISTIC LEGAL MINDSET THAT IS PREVALENT AMONG POLISH LAWYERS. THIS MINDSET IS CHARACTERIZED BY A REDUCTIONISM OF THE INTERPRETATIVE PREMISES TO BE APPLIED WHEN DECIDING CONSTITUTIONAL CASES. THIS REDUCTIONISM IS CONSPICUOUS IN THE APPLICATION OF BRIGHT-LINE RULES WITH NO CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. I ARGUE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A ROBUST, NON-FORMALISTIC METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL DECISION-MAKING IS A PREREQUISITE FOR A SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
857	SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, POLITICAL REFORMS IN MOROCCO HAVE EMPHASIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. SUCH REFERENCES TO THE RULE OF LAW HAVE OFTEN BEEN ATTACHED TO POLITICAL PROJECTS SUCH AS ALTERNANCE (1998-2002) OR ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGNS THAT STRESSED THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPREMACY OF LAWS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOROCCO REMAINS AN AUTHORITARIAN STATE, IT IS THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THE MEANING OF RULE OF LAW IS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL DEBATES AND THAT AT THE CORE OF THESE DEBATES IS THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC POTENTIAL IMPLIED IN THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT SUCH NORMATIVE DEBATES ARE PART OF A POWER FIELD IN WHICH DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEANINGS ARE ATTACHED TO REFORMS AND DEBATES. ACTUAL REFORMS IN MOROCCO IN THE AREA OF JUSTICE HAVE HAD THE RESULT OF MULTIPLYING MEANINGS. TO OVERCOME THE LIMITS INHERENT IN A PLURALITY OF MEANINGS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT REFORMS IN THE AREA OF JUSTICE NEED TO CLARIFY THE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW AND NEED TO BE BASED ON A TRANSPARENT DEBATE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS.
858	AIM: THE EXERCISE WILL CONSIST IN ESTABLISHING THE MEANINGS OF THE CONCEPTS RELATED TO THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW. METHODS: INDEED, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT COLOMBIA IS UNDER THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW? THE EXPRESSION MEANS THAT THE CONSTITUENTS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE DECIDED ON A SPECIFIC FORM OF STATE AND EXCLUDED OTHERS. BUT WHAT CHARACTERIZES IT? RESULTS: WHILE BEING A SUPREMELY RICH TOPIC FULL OF IMPLICATIONS ABOUT WHICH ENTIRE BOOKS COULD BE WRITTEN, IT WILL BE PRESENTED IN A SUMMARIZED MANNER TRYING TO GATHER ALL THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND IT. CONCLUSIONS: IF THERE IS NO RULE OF LAW, THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY. THE SOCIAL RULE OF LAW ALSO STRIVES FOR THE REALIZATION OF FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL RIGHTS.
859	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE WIDELY PUBLICIZED INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2008-2009 TO DETERMINE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE ABYEI REGION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN IN THE WAKE OF DECADES OF CIVIL WAR. ON THE SURFACE, THE ABYEI ARBITRATION IS A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW ARBITRATION CAN RESOLVE EVEN THE MOST INTRACTABLE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES. BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SUGGESTS AN AWARD THAT INVOKED PRINCIPLES OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND THE RULE OF LAW, BUT COMPROMISED THOSE PRINCIPLES BY DISREGARDING THE TERMS OF THE TRIBUNAL'S MANDATE AND THE THOROUGHLY REASONED DETERMINATION BY EXPERTS APPOINTED BY THE PARTIES. THE ABYEI AWARD INSTEAD FASHIONED A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF RENEWED WARFARE BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THAT SOLUTION PRODUCED NEITHER PEACE NOR A STABLE SUDAN, WHICH HAS BEEN TORN BY VIOLENCE IN THE YEARS SINCE THE AWARD, INCLUDING IN THE ABYEI REGION. BUT WHATEVER FUTURE RESULTS IT PRODUCES IN SUDAN, THE TRIBUNAL'S AWARD ALSO RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND INTERNATIONAL ADJUDICATION. BY ADOPTING A RESULT BASED LESS ON THE LAW AND THE FACTS THAN ON AN APPARENT POLITICAL COMPROMISE, THE ABYEI AWARD ARGUABLY UNDERCUT KEY PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST CENTURY.
860	THERE IS NO CLEAR AND GENERALLY RECOGNISED CONCEPT OR DEFINITION OF EXCLUSIONARY ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION UNDER ART. 102 TFEU. THIS CREATES LEGAL UNCERTAINTY, MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE COMMISSION TO ACT DECISIVELY, AND LEADS TO DELAYS. IT LEADS TO PRESSURE ON SUPPOSEDLY DOMINANT COMPANIES TO OFFER COMMITMENTS EVEN IN SITUATIONS IN WHICH IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THERE IS ANY LEGAL NEED FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE MOST TOPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THE LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY IS THE SUGGESTION THAT IF A CONGLOMERATE GROUP INCLUDES ONE COMPANY THAT IS DOMINANT IN ONE SECTOR, THE GROUP MUST EXTEND TO ALL THE GROUP'S COMPETITORS THE TREATMENT THAT IT GIVES TO EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THIS WOULD LEAD TO LESS COMPETITION RATHER THAN MORE. THE SOLUTION IS TO REGARD ART. 102(B) ("LIMITING PRODUCTION, MARKETS OR TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE PREJUDICE OF CONSUMERS") AS THE DEFINITION OF EXCLUSIONARY ABUSE, AS THE EU COURTS HAVE DONE.
861	THE EU'S LIMITED POWERS DO NOT ENABLE ITS INSTITUTIONS TO EFFECTIVELY INTERVENE IN CASES WHERE MEMBER STATE ACTIONS THREATEN FUNDAMENTAL VALUES. THE RECENT CONTROVERSIES EMERGING FROM SOME MEMBER STATES' HUMAN RIGHTS AND RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING TURNED THIS QUESTION TO ONE OF THE CORE ISSUES OF THE EUROPEAN PROJECT, CALLING FOR EFFECTIVE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS PROTECTION IN THE EU WITHOUT SUPPRESSING NATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITIES. THOUGH EU LAW'S APPROACH, AT LEAST AT FIRST GLANCE, MIGHT APPEAR TO BE IDIOSYNCRATIC, IT IS FAR FROM UNPRECEDENTED AND, AS FAR AS MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONALISM IS CONCERNED, EU LAW MAY DRAW ON THE EXPERIENCES OF VARIOUS REGIMES WHERE CENTRALIZED HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION AND NATIONAL OR STATE CONSTITUTIONAL IDENTITIES COEXIST. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CURRENT EUROPEAN APPROACH AS TO THE APPLICATION OF THE FEDERAL BILL OF RIGHTS TO STATES FROM A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND EXPLORES THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND JURISPRUDENTIAL PATTERNS ADDRESSING THE QUESTION OF INQUIRY IN A MULTILEVEL CONSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES THE SUBJECT FROM A DOCTRINAL, ONTOLOGICAL, TEXTUAL-CONCEPTUAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE WITH THE AIM OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE CURRENT EUROPEAN DEBATE WITH A NEW COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND FOSTERING EU CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITH STRUCTURAL PATTERNS. IT SUBMITS THAT THE CURRENTLY PREVAILING PARADIGM OF "SCOPE" SHOULD BE REPLACED OR COMPLEMENTED WITH THE PARADIGM OF "CORE STANDARDS" AND PROPOSES A DOCTRINE OF EUROPEAN INCORPORATION, ARGUING THAT THE DIAGONALLY APPLICABLE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED VIA ARTICLE 2 TEU TO MAKE THEM JUDICIALLY APPLICABLE.
862	THIS ISSUE BRIEF PROVIDES A SUCCINCT AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF "ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW" AS AN EMERGING CONCEPT. FOLLOWING AN OUTLINE OF ITS ORIGINS, THIS ARTICLE PLACES ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE CONTESTED LANDSCAPE OF RULE OF LAW THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT CONCLUDES WITH SEVERAL CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS, EXPLAINING THAT THOSE PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW AS A GUIDING FRAMEWORK NEED TO RECOGNIZE BROADER RULE OF LAW DEBATES AND ACKNOWLEDGE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH RELYING ON A RULE OF LAW PARADIGM FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AGENDA. THE FOCUS THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE IS PRIMARILY ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. THERE EXISTS A RISK THAT ENVIRONMENTAL RULE OF LAW, LIKE TRADITIONAL "LAW AND DEVELOPMENT" OR RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMING, DIVERTS VALUABLE TIME, RESOURCES AND INSTITUTIONS FROM THE MORE DIFFICULT BUT LESS GLAMOROUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHOICES THAT ACTUALLY SIT AT THE CENTRE OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY-MAKING AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES.
863	TRADITIONALLY, THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE GREEK NOTION OF NU OMICRON MU OMICRON SIGMA, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE NOTION AS IT WAS CONCEIVED IN ATHENS, HAS BEEN HINDERED BY A TENDENCY TO PROJECT MODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LAW ONTO THE ANCIENT MENTALITY AND PRAXIS. THE FIRST CONFUSION COMES FROM THE EXCLUSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF NU OMICRON MU OMICRON SIGMA WITH THE MODERN CONCEPT OF LAW, WHICH ORIGINATES IN THE ROMAN TRADITION AND HAS SUBSTANTIAL SEMANTIC AND PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES WITH THE GREEK NOTION. THE PAPER PRESENTS A DIACHRONIC CONSIDERATION OF THE CONCEPT OF NOMOS AND EXPLAINS HOW THE WORD ACQUIRED THE DIFFERENT MEANINGS THAT LED TO ITS CLASSICAL FUNCTION, ESPECIALLY IN THE ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY, AS 1. ORDER THAT ORGANIZES THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE SOCIETY, 2. THE DEMOCRATIC NOTION OF "RULE OF LAW", 3. THE NOTION OF "THE LAW OF NATURE" AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CONCEPT OF "NATURAL LAW", AND 4. THE DEMOCRATIC AND PLATONIC NOTIONS OF RULE OF LAW, THEIR DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THE PAPER IS THAT THE SEMANTIC KERNEL OF NOMOS IS NOT ONLY LINKED TO THE CONCEPT OF "DISTRIBUTION", OR RATHER "JUST DISTRIBUTION", BUT ALSO TO THE NOTIONS OF "ORDER" AND "REPETITION" IN THE DIFFERENT FIELDS OF HUMAN ACTION THROUGH THE IDEA OF THE HIERARCHIC DISTRIBUTION OF VALUES IN HUMAN SOCIETY. FINALLY, THE PAPER POINTS TO PLATO'S CONCEPT OF "RULE OF LAW" AND ITS VALUE FOR US, UNDERLINING THE DANGER OF SOME PHILOSOPHICAL POSITIONS, SUCH AS PERFECTIONISM, AS INVOLVING A REVIVAL OF TOTALITARIAN IDEAS.
864	DELVING INTO THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE STATE AND INFORMALITY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE INFORMALITY OF THE LEGAL AND JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. PRODUCED BY STRUCTURALLY POWERFUL ACTORS, THIS KIND OF INFORMALITY IS NOT SO MUCH LEGITIMIZED BY THE LAW, BUT CONCEALED WITHIN THE VERY PROCESS OF LEGITIMIZATION. TO CAPTURE HOW LEGAL ENGINEERING WELDS FORMALIZED LAWS WITH INFORMAL TRANSLATIONS, I LOOK AT JUDICIAL OUTCOMES THAT, WHILE FORMALLY LEGAL, ARE SOCIALLY DELEGITIMIZED AND PERCEIVED AS LEGAL CORRUPTION. AFTER ANALYSING THE CONTESTED JUDICIAL OUTCOMES OF WARSAW'S 'REPRIVATIZATION' PROCESS (PROPERTY RESTITUTION), I DEFINE THE MECHANISM OF LEGAL CORRUPTION AS RULES-LAWYERING, BY WHICH I MEAN AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN LEGAL ADVANTAGE BY OBSESSIVELY STICKING TO THE WRITTEN LAWS, WHILE DELIBERATELY DESECRATING ITS SPIRIT. I DESCRIBE THREE OF ITS MECHANISMS: APPROPRIATION, REDEFINITION AND FRAUD LAUNDERING. FINALLY, IN MY PRELIMINARY VIVISECTION OF THE RECENT AND ONGOING PROCESS OF DELEGALIZING THE LEGAL CORRUPTION THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE REPRIVATIZATION PROCESS, ALL THE ALLIED CONCEPTS OF THIS FORUM COME TOGETHER TO DEMONSTRATE THE ESSENTIAL INSEPARABILITY OF INFORMALITY AND STATE.
865	ACCEPTANCE OF THE MEANING, OPERATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EU BY ITS MEMBER STATES IS CRITICAL TO THE UNION'S LEGITIMACY. ANY PERCEIVED OR REAL CRISIS IN THE RULE OF LAW THUS MERITS CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON HOW A CRISIS IN THE RULE OF LAW OCCURRED WITHIN THE EU AND HOW THE INTENDED AMBIGUITY OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS ENTRENCHED THIS CRISIS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE CRISIS HAS BEEN THE EU'S DEVELOPMENT OF A UNIQUE IDEATION OF THE RULE OF LAW - AS A CONSTITUTIONAL NORM, POLICY INSTRUMENT AND VALUE - THAT 'HOLLOWED OUT' THE RULE OF LAW FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE TO AN EXPEDIENT POLICY TOOL. THE EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE ENTRENCHED THE CRISIS IN THE RULE OF LAW AND THEN TRIED TO MANAGE THE CHASM BETWEEN WHAT IT DEEMS AS RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND CERTAIN MEMBER STATES' CONDUCT.
866	INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL SECTION - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEMORY LAWS AND THE RULE OF LAW - EXPLOITING LAW IN THE SERVICE OF HISTORICAL POLICY AND UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY - RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING - DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING - RISK OF ABUSE OF MEMORY LAWS
867	WHAT HAPPENS TO INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES WHEN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THE MARKET ECONOMY ARE INTRODUCED? DEMOCRATIZING THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION ENTAILS SEPARATING IT, INCLUDING THE POLICE, FROM POLITICAL POWER-HOLDERS. THIS QUESTION IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE IN COUNTRIES HAVING UNDERGONE A "WAR TRANSITION", ARE DEMOCATIC RULES CAPABLE OF REGULATING A SOCIETY TILL THEN IN WAR THAT HAS BORN THE BRUNT OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND OF A PERVERSE REGIME? WHAT PLACE DOES ORGANIZED CRIME HAVE IN RECYCLING SOLDIERS RELEASED FROM THE ARMED SERVICE? WHAT STATUS IS TO BE GIVEN TO SPECIAL POLICE UNITS AFTER THE WAR? HOW CAN A STATE, AS IT DEVELOPS THE RULE OF LAW, TAKE CONTROL OVER SUCH POLICE FORCES, WHICH HAD CLOSE TIES WITH THE FORMER GOVERNMENT? THE HANDLING OF THE SPECIAL OPERATION UNIT OF THE POLICE IS A CRITERION FOR ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF DEMOCRATIZATION ACHIEVED IN SERBIA SINCE MILOSEVIC'S FALL. REFORMING INTERNAL SECURITY IS NECESSARY TO THE PROPER OPERATION OF THE STATE UNDER THE RULE OF LAW.
868	THE ANCIENT PERSIAN EMPIRES ARE DENOTED AS DESPOTIC, PRACTICING ARBITRARY RULE WHILE GREECE, PERSIA'S ARCHRIVAL DURING THE SIXTH TO FOURTH CENTURY BC, EXERCISED RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER USES A CONTRACT THEORY FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE EXISTENCE OF RULE OF LAW IN THE CITY-STATES OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ITS ABSENCE IN PERSIA. I DISCUSS THE ROLE OF GEOGRAPHICAL CONDITIONS OF LAND (OPEN PLAINS VERSUS MOUNTAINS), POPULATION PRESSURE, PROXIMITY TO THE SEA AND FORM OF TRADE (OVERLAND VERSUS OVERSEAS) AS FACTORS CONDUCIVE TO RULE OF LAW IN THE CITY-STATES OF ANCIENT GREECE AND TO DESPOTISM IN ANCIENT PERSIA. SPECIFICALLY, THE ROLE OF TRADE VIA LAND IN PERSIA PRIOR TO THE FIFTH CENTURY BC IS COMPARED TO THE ROLE OF SEA TRADE (ALONGSIDE WITH PIRACY) IN ANCIENT GREECE. I ARGUE THAT IN ANCIENT PERSIA MONARCHS COULD TAX OR EXPROPRIATE MUCH OF THE GAINS FROM OVERLAND TRADE, PREVENTING THE ACCUMULATION OF AN INDEPENDENT FORM OF WEALTH BY MERCHANTS. IN GREECE, SEA TRADE ALONGSIDE THE PRACTICE OF PIRACY LED TO GAINS FROM TRADE THAT COULD NOT BE EASILY EXPROPRIATED BY THE MONARCHS AND ACTED AS A BALANCING FORCE VIS-A-VIS THE POWER OF THE MONARCHS, CREATING A BASIS FOR RULE OF LAW IN THE GREEK CITY-STATES.
869	THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON TWO CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF COERCION VIS-A- VISPERSONS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES IN NORWAY. THE FIRST CONDITION CONCERNS THE WIDESPREAD USE OF EXEMPTIONS FROM LEGALLY BINDING EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THREE INDEPENDENT SOURCES WE CLAIM THAT EXEMPTIONS FROM EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE MADE FOR 80% OF THE INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY THE DECISIONS, AND IN 2007 ONLY 3% OF ALL APPLICATIONS WERE REJECTED BY THE COUNTY GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE SECOND CONDITION RELATES TO A FIVE-FOLD INCREASE IN DECISIONS REGARDING THE USE OF COERCION BETWEEN 1999 AND 2008. WE HAVE USED REGISTRY DATA FROM THE NORWEGIAN BOARD OF HEALTH SUPERVISION CONCERNING NOTIFICATIONS AND DECISIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF FORCE AND COERCION THAT WAS GATHERED BETWEEN 1999 AND 2008. SECOND, WE CARRIED OUT A PILOT STUDY IN WHICH WE CONSIDERED A SAMPLE OF THE NOTIFICATIONS AND DECISIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF COERCION BETWEEN 2007 AND 2008. THIRD, WE HAVE CARRIED OUT A TELEPHONE SURVEY WHERE ALL 19 COUNTY GOVERNORS WERE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ROUTINES REGARDING NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NORWEGIAN BOARD OF HEALTH SUPERVISION IN 2009. OUR FINDINGS ARE THAT USE OF COERCION AND RESTRAINT, AND THE LACK OF LEGALLY BINDING QUALIFICATIONS, ARE CLOSELY RELATED. FURTHERMORE, THE DOMINANT PRACTICE OF EXEMPTIONS FROM LEGALLY BINDING EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS WEAKENS THE RULE OF LAW.
870	AT THE INSTITUTIONAL CORE OF GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT ONLY A STRONG INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY BUT ALSO AN EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION SERVICE COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROSECUTORS TO PROMOTE AND STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW, INCLUDING THEIR DUTY TO COMBAT IMPUNITY AND ENSURE THE LAWFULNESS OF STATE ACTIONS. THIS PAPER REVIEWS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PROSECUTORS CAN ANTICIPATE IN PERFORMING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. IT ALSO TOUCHES UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS IN RELATION TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF EMERGENCY SITUATIONS (E.G. COUNTER-TERRORIST ACTIVITIES), WITHIN THE GLOBAL REGIME OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN CRIMINAL MATTERS AND IN THE CONTEXT OF POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION AND PEACE-BUILDING INITIATIVES.
871	ACCORDING TO POPULAR WISDOM, JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND THE RILE OF LAW ARE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF MODERN DEMOCRACY DRAWING ON THE GROWING COMPARATIVE LITERATURE ON COURTS, WE UNPACK THIS CLAIM BY FOCUSING ON TWO BROAD QUESTIONS: HOW DOES THE TYPE OF POLITICAL REGIME AFFECT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE? ARE INDEPENDENT COURTS, IN FACT, ALWAYS ESSENTIAL FOR ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW? IN HIGHLIGHTING THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL FRAGMENTATION AND PUBLIC OPINION, WE EXPLAIN WHY DEMOCRACIES ARE INDEED MORE LIKELY THAN DICTATORSHIPS TO PRODUCE BOTH INDEPENDENT COURTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. YET, BY ALSO CONSIDERING THE PUZZLE OF INSTITUTIONAL INSTABILITY THAT MARKS COURTS IN MUCH OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD, WE IDENTIFY SEVERAL REASONS WHY DEMOCRACY MAY NOT ALWAYS PROVE SUFFICIENT FOR CONSTRUCTING EITHER. FINALLY, WE ARGUE THAT INDEPENDENT COURTS ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY FOR THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY WHERE SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IS RELATIVELY WIDESPREAD.
872	RULE OF LAW PRACTITIONERS HAVE DEFINED RULE OF LAW AS A WAY TO ACHIEVE SEVERAL OBJECTIVES. THREE COMMONLY CITED OBJECTIVES ARE THAT RULE OF LAW SHOULD: 1. HOLD THE GOVERNING POWERS ACCOUNTABLE AND LIMIT OFFICIAL ARBITRARINESS; 2. ALLOW PEOPLE TO PLAN THEIR AFFAIRS WITH REASONABLE CONFIDENCE THROUGH OPEN, CLEAR, AND STABLE RULES WHERE THE STATE MONOPOLIZES THE USE OF VIOLENCE IN THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES; AND 3. PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SUCH AS THOSE EMBODIED BY THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, THE CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN, THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, AND THE CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE. THIS NOTE PROVIDES A CASE STUDY OF AFGHANISTAN TO HIGHLIGHT THAT INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE RULE OF LAW IN CONFLICT SOCIETIES MUST FOREMOST ENSURE THE FIRST RULE OF LAW OBJECTIVE. A FAILURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IMPEDES THE SUCCESS OF ALL OTHER RULE OF LAW OBJECTIVES. IF POWER-HOLDERS CAN ARBITRARILY EXERT THEIR WILL, PEOPLE CANNOT PREDICTABLY ORDER THEIR AFFAIRS AND REALIZE THE SECOND RULE OF LAW OBJECTIVE.(1) IN A CULTURE OF IMPUNITY, HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AT THE UPPERMOST-AND THE MOST VISIBLE, STANDARD-SETTING LEVELS-GO UNPUNISHED, UPSETTING THE THIRD RULE OF LAW OBJECTIVE. THE CURRENT CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK IN AFGHANISTAN HAS NOT INTRODUCED MEANINGFUL CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. INSTEAD, IT HAS CONCENTRATED POWER IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, CREATING A PATRONAGE SYSTEM THAT SINK FROM THE TOP DOWN INTO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY AND MOST VISIBLE MEANS OF HOLDING POWERBROKERS ACCOUNTABLE, WHICH IS ITSELF COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO AN AFGHANISTAN THAT IS INDEPENDENT AND LEGITIMATE IN THE EYES OF ITS OWN PEOPLE.(2) DESPITE THIS TOP-DOWN WEIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION, FLEDGLING BOTTOM-UP CHECK ON POWER-HOLDERS HAVE BEEN REALIZED BY A NATIONAL PROGRAM NOT EXPLICITLY FOCUSED ON ESTABLISHING RULE OF LAW, BUT RATHER PRIMARILY AIMED AT BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND ENABLING COMMUNITY GOVERNANCE. THIS PROGRAM, KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL SOLIDARITY PROGRAM ("NSP"), FEATURES A STREAMLINED CENTRAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT ALSO DECENTRALIZES SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM AND BUDGET AUTHORITY TO LOCAL ELECTED COUNCILS. THE PROGRAM HAS ACHIEVED MEASURABLE SUCCESSES IN ENSURING THAT COUNCILS TRANSPARENTLY MANAGE THEIR BUDGETS AND THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOLD THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MISUSE OF BUDGETARY AND PROJECT AUTHORITY. HOWEVER, RECENT EFFORTS TO BRING NSP'S ELECTED COUNCILS INTO THE CONSTITUTION'S FRAMEWORK OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE THREATEN THE VERY CHARACTERISTIC THAT EXPLAINS THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THIS ACCOUNTABILITY-THE INDEPENDENCE TO MANAGE LOCALLY ADMINISTERED BUDGETS AND ELECTIONS. THIS NOTE AIMS TO SHOW THAT FUTURE EFFORTS AT BUILDING RULE OF LAW IN A TRANSITIONING CONFLICT SOCIETY SHOULD ENABLE, WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION, LOCAL ADVANTAGES THAT ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE ENABLING PROVISIONS MUST BE IN PLACE EARLY: AFGHANISTAN DEMONSTRATES THE EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY OF PIVOTING FROM A HIGHLY CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT TO A DECENTRALIZED ONE. POWER HAS AMASSED IN INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT NOW WILL NOT READILY RELINQUISH AUTHORITY.
873	RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY PROBABLY IS, AMONG THOSE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS SHADOWED BY THE SO CALLED "WAR AGAINST TERRORISM", ONE OF THE MOST AFFECTED, NOT ONLY IN THE USA BUT ALSO IN EUROPE. IT HAS BEEN SAD TO DISCOVER COE MEMBER STATES' VOICES CLAIMING IN FAVOUR OF NATIONAL SECURITY AND AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE LEGAL ACQUIS CONSOLIDATED BY THE RULE OF LAW. THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS, ROOTED AS IT IS IN A DEEP DEMOCRATIC TRADITION, HAS RESISTED AGAINST TEMPTATION, SOCIAL PRESSURE PROVOKED BY TERRORISM, AND OPPOSITION OF ECHR CONTRACTING PARTIES, AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY TO THIS ACQUIS BY MEANS OF ITS CASE-LAW, WHICH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH MORE THAN A HUNDRED CASES, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY. THE COURT HAS BEEN CATEGORICAL WHEN REMINDING MEMBER STATES THEIR ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS CONCERNING THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM WITHIN A TRULY DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY.
874	OBJECTIVES THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER JUDICIAL INSULATION INFLUENCES HOW INDIVIDUALS ASSESS THE RULE OF LAW. METHODS WE EMPLOY PANEL DATA MODELS USING DATA COLLECTED BY THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER SOURCES TO DIFFERENTIATE THE INFLUENCE OF TWO KINDS OF JUDICIAL INSULATION-DESIGNED (DE JURE) AND IMPLEMENTED (DE FACTO)-ON INDIVIDUALS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE VIABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THEIR COUNTRY. RESULTS WE FIND THAT WHILE INSULATION (AS DESIGNED) HAS NO BEARING ON HOW INDIVIDUALS SCORE RULE OF LAW STRENGTH, INSULATION (AS IMPLEMENTED) INCREASES INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENTS. NOTABLY, WE FIND THAT DISAPPOINTMENT FROM UNMET EXPECTATIONS-WHERE INSTITUTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION FALLS SHORT OF DESIGN-NEGATIVELY INFLUENCES RULE OF LAW STRENGTH SCORES. CONCLUSIONS WE CONCLUDE THAT THE DEGREE TO WHICH EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE INSULATION AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY ARE MET (OR NOT MET) CAN HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW THE VIABILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IS PERCEIVED.
875	ALTHOUGH THE RULE OF LAW HAS IN THE PAST BEEN DERIDED AS REACTIONARY OR VAGUE, NOWADAYS IT HAS A SETTLED MEANING. IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS SEEKING WORKABLE OBJECTIVES. IT HAS FORCE AS A PRINCIPLE GOVERNING AND CONSTRAINING ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW. IT IS INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONALLY, SUCH AS THROUGH COUNCIL OF EUROPE GUIDANCE. IT IS NOT A MONOPOLY OF DEVELOPED SOCIETIES BUT REFLECTS A BASIC RECOGNITION OF EVERYONE'S EQUAL DIGNITY.
876	THIS ARTICLE ILLUMINATES THE NORMATIVE BASIS FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW'S REGULATION OF PUBLIC EMERGENCIES BY ARGUING THAT HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEST CONCEIVED AS NORMS ARISING FROM A FIDUCIARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATES (OR STATE-LIKE ACTORS) AND PERSONS SUBJECT TO THEIR POWER. STATES BEAR A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO GUARANTEE SUBJECTS' SECURE AND EQUAL FREEDOM, A DUTY THAT FLOWS FROM THEIR INSTITUTIONAL ASSUMPTION OF SOVEREIGN POWERS. THE FIDUCIARY THEORY DISARMS CARL SCHMITT'S CRITIQUE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM BY EXPLAINING HOW EMERGENCY POWERS CAN BE RECONCILED WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
877	THIS PAPER CONSIDERS HOW SCIENCE FICTION, AND THE SUBGENRES OF SPECULATIVE HISTORICISM AND FUTURISM IN PARTICULAR, MIGHT OPEN LEGAL DISCOURSE TO HITHERTO UNSEEN AND POTENTIALLY INSTRUCTIVE PERSPECTIVES. IT BEGINS WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT RECENT HISTORICAL EVENTS OF GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE SUCH AS THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP IN 2016, THE OUTBREAK OF THE COVID19 PANDEMIC OF 2020, AND THE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS OF 2021, WERE WIDELY PREDICTED AND FORESEEN IN THE MEDIA BY WAY OF POLITICAL REPORTING AS MUCH AS POPULAR SOCIAL AND NATURAL SCIENCE REPORTING IN THE YEARS AND DECADES PRIOR. THE SAME TROPES WERE ALSO PRESENT IN THE PLOTLINES OF POPULAR LITERATURE, TELEVISION, AND FILM DURING THAT PERIOD. THE CENTRAL ARGUMENT OF THE PAPER IS THAT BEFORE MEDIA PUNDITS AND POLICY-MAKERS EXPRESSED THEIR SURPRISE AT THE FRAGILITY OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE "UNPRECEDENTED" ASCENT OF TRUMP, THE LETHAL CAPACITY AND TRANSMISSIBILITY OF A "NOVEL" CORONAVIRUS, AND THE "SUDDEN" ARRIVAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE DAILY LIVES OF NORTH AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS, THE SPECTRE OF THESE MENACES HAD ALREADY PENETRATED OUR COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUS IN A WAY THAT OUGHT TO HAVE CHANGED OUTCOMES. NEIL POSTMAN'S CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE PRESENT EPOCH AS "TECHNOPOLY" IS A MEANS OF EXPLAINING HOW, DESPITE AMPLE WARNINGS, WE WERE NOT READY FOR MUCH. TECHNOPOLY REFERS TO THE HISTORICAL PRESENT AS THE HISTORICAL MOMENT IN WHICH THE TECHNOCRATIC CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, STATES, AND MARKETS TO RESPOND TO EXISTENTIAL PROBLEMS IS HINDERED BY INFORMATION OVERLOAD, E.G., THE THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW PRESENTED BY AN OUTGOING AMERICAN PRESIDENT WHO REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF THE ELECTORATE; THE THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH POSED BY PERSISTENT VACCINE MISINFORMATION AND INEQUITABLE GLOBAL VACCINE DISTRIBUTION; AND, THE THREAT POSED TO OUR COLLECTIVE HABITAT BY EXTREME CLIMATE EVENTS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT FICTION IS A POWERFUL POTENTIAL ANTIDOTE TO THE NUMBING EFFECTS OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD IN TECHNOPOLY IF IT IS TREATED SERIOUSLY AS A SOURCE OF NORMATIVE AUTHORITY RATHER THAN DISMISSED AS PURE DIVERSION.
878	AFTER THE GLOBAL CRISIS THE CORE-PERIPHERY DIVIDE HAS DEEPENED IN THE EU BETWEEN THE MOST DEVELOPED CORE COUNTRIES AND THE EAST-CENTRAL EUROPEAN (ECE) COUNTRIES THAT HAS BEEN MOST MANIFEST IN THE VIOLATIONS OF RULE OF LAW (RL) BY POLAND AND HUNGARY. THIS PROCESS OF CONFRONTATION WITH THE EU RULES AND VALUES HAS BEEN TERMED IN THE PAPER AS DE-EUROPEANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN ANALYSED IN ITS HISTORICAL TRAJECTORY FROM THE "COPENHAGEN DILEMMA" TO THE "JUNCKER PARADOX", AS BOTH OF THEM HAVE ENCOURAGED THE ECE AUTOCRATIC REGIMES BY THEIR NEGLECTENCE. NAMELY, THE PAPER ARGUES FIRST THAT THE COPENHAGEN CRITERIA HAVE NOT BEEN WELL PREPARED FOR REGULATING THE ACCESSION OF THE NEW MEMBER STATES (NMS), SINCE THE EU HAS NOT ELABORATED A PROPER FACILITATING MECHANISM FOR THE SUSTAINABLE EUROPEANIZATION OF NMS. THEREFORE, THE COPENHAGEN DILEMMA HAS EMERGED IN THE EU, WHICH MEANS THAT AFTER THE ACCESSION THE EU HAS NOT HAD THE LEGAL TOOLS TO CORRECT THE DIVERGENCE FROM DEMOCRACY IN NMS. THE LEGAL TOOLKITS - THE INFRINGEMENT PROCESS AND THE ARTICLE 7 PROCEDURE - HAVE NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE TO ENFORCE RL IN ECE, AS THE INCREASING CONFLICTS WITH POLAND AND HUNGARY HAVE DEMONSTRATED. MOREOVER, FOR SECOND, DUE TO THE "POLYCRISIS", THE JUNCKER COMMISSION HAS FOCUSED ON THE PRIORITIES OF THE CORE AND IT HAS NEGLECTED THESE VIOLATIONS OF EU RULES AND VALUES. THIS NEGLECTENCE AND INACTION HAS BEEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE IT HAS INCREASED THE RL CONFLICTS AND HAS GIVEN MANOEUVRING ROOM FOR THE HARD POPULIST ECE REGIMES THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER AS THE JUNCKER PARADOX. THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ECE DIVERGENCE FROM THE EU MAINSTREAM HAS BEEN THEIR FAILURE IN THE CATCHING UP PROCESS TO PRODUCE COMPETITIVE ECONOMY AND SUSTAINABLE DEMOCRACY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS STAGE BOTH THE EU NEEDS TO RECONSTRUCT IS LEGAL TOOLKITS AS PART OF ITS NEW INTEGRATION STRATEGY AND THE ECE STATES HAVE TO OVERCOME THEIR CURRENT SOCIO-POLITICAL CRISIS THAT HAS PRODUCED THESE HARD POPULIST REGIMES.
879	JUSTICE SCALIA IS FAMOUS FOR HIS STRONG RULE ORIENTATION, BEST ARTICULATED IN HIS 1989 ARTICLE, THE RULE OF LAW AS A LAW OF RULES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT RULE ORIENTATION IN THE CONTEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION'S ORIGINAL MEANING. WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS FAR LESS CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSTITUTION THAN IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED. THE USE OF STANDARDS RATHER THAN RULES IS PRESCRIBED NOT ONLY BY A FEW PROVISIONS IN THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT BUT ALSO BY KEY ASPECTS OF THE 1788 CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT. THE EXECUTIVE POWER, THE NECESSARY AND PROPER POWER, AND INDEED THE ENTIRE SCHEME OF ENUMERATED POWERS ARE ALL INFUSED WITH STANDARDS, LARGELY THROUGH THE CONSTITUTION'S IMPLICIT INCORPORATION OF FIDUCIARY NORMS AS A BACKGROUND PRINCIPLE OF INTERPRETATION. THE CONSTITUTION OFTEN PRESCRIBES RULES, BUT IT OFTEN DOES NOT. THE LAW IS WHAT IT IS, WHETHER OR NOT IT CONFORMS TO SOME ABSTRACT JURISPRUDENTIAL NORM. THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT A LAW OF RULES. IT IS A LAW OF LAW.

881	BY DISCUSSING THE EXPERIENCES OF HUNGARY AND POLAND, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE THREE LAYERS OF THE RULE OF LAW WHICH ARE RELEVANT FOR EU COMPETITION LAW. THE FIRST ONE IS EXTERNAL: IT RELATES TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM OF EU MEMBER STATES OF WHICH COMPETITION LAW IS A PART. IN NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS, RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE COMPETITION LAW SYSTEM TO PERFORM ITS ROLE. THE SECOND ONE IS INTERNAL: IT CONCERNS RULE OF LAW SAFEGUARDS IN RELATION TO THE MEMBER STATES' COMPETITION AUTHORITIES, IN PARTICULAR THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THE THIRD ONE IS CONSEQUENTIAL: THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW WITHIN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL LAYERS AFFECTS THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE COMPETITION LAW SYSTEM. AS A RESULT, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ARTICLES 101 AND 102 TFEU IS ENDANGERED, AND A VICIOUS CIRCLE OF MUTUALLY REINFORCING COMPETITION LAW AND RULE OF LAW CRISES UNFOLDS.
882	ADDRESS TO THE 2010 RULE OF LAW IN AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE: THE RULE OF LAW, THE COURTS AND CONSTITUTIONS, SYDNEY, SATURDAY, 6 NOVEMBER 2010.
883	THE ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE IDEOLOGY OF RULE OF LAW SERVES TO MOBILIZE CONSENT IN THE TANZANIAN FORMATION. IT REVIEWS THE POSITION IN THE EXTANT LITERATURE WHICH ARGUES THAT THE FAILURE OF THE RULE OF LAW AS A LEGITIMIZING IDEOLOGY IN AFRICAN POLITICAL FORMATIONS IS LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE AFRICAN RULING CLASSES TO SUSTAIN SUCH A PROJECT GIVEN THE DEPENDENT OR NEO-COLONIAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THEIR SOCIETIES. THE ARTICLE QUESTIONS WHETHER THIS IS THE SOLE EXPLANATION AND PUTS FORWARD THE POSITION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IDEOLOGY IS NOT NECESSARILY RESONANT WITH THE WORLD VIEW OF POPULAR CLASSES IN TANZANIA. IN THIS REGARD, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE WESTERN DEBATE ON THE RULE OF LAW AS AN 'UNQUALIFIED GOOD' AND THE FOCUS ON RIGHTS STRUGGLE ARE NOT UNCRITICALLY TRANSFERABLE TO AN AFRICAN SITUATION. IT CALLS FOR AN INTELLECTUAL BREAK FROM THE CURRENT CELEBRATION OF LIBERALISM, CONSTITUTIONALISM AND HUMAN RIGHTS AS THE ONLY, OR EVEN THE PRINCIPAL, ALTERNATIVE IDEOLOGIES FOR A POPULAR PROJECT OF SOCIAL EMANCIPATION AND NATIONAL LIBERATION.
884	WE LIVE IN A TIME OF ANXIETY ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW. IN RAILING AGAINST INDIVIDUAL JUDGES AND THEIR DECISIONS, ANGRY PROTESTERS-INCLUDING ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE PRESIDENT-PRESUME A KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES, JUDICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING. RECENT BLUSTER RAISES A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF THE PRESIDENT ORDERED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEFY A JUDICIAL RULING. THE IDEA THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY IN MATTERS OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION-WHICH OFTEN RIDES UNDER THE HEADING OF "JUDICIAL SUPREMACY"-HAS ACQUIRED STRONG CURRENCY. IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICAL IDEAS, IT HAS SUBSTANTIALLY ECLIPSED "DEPARTMENTALIST" THEORIES, WHICH HOLD THAT EACH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION FOR ITSELF, AND AN ALLIED NOTION OF "POPULAR CONSTITUTIONALISM." IN THE VIEW OF MANY, THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES JUDICIAL SUPREMACY. THIS ARTICLE PROBES THE CONCEPTS OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY, DEPARTMENTALISM, POPULAR CONSTITUTIONALISM, AND THE RULE OF LAW, ALL OF WHICH POSSESS RELATIVELY TIMELESS IMPORTANCE. IN DOING SO, IT SHEDS LIGHT ON ISSUES OF IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL URGENCY. THE TRUTH, TERRIFYINGLY ENOUGH UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, IS THAT OUR SYSTEM IS NOT, NEVER HAS BEEN, AND PROBABLY NEVER COULD BE ONE OF PURE JUDICIAL SUPREMACY. IN PRINCIPLE, MOREOVER, A REGIME IN WHICH JUDICIAL REVIEW OPERATES WITHIN "POLITICALLY CONSTRUCTED BOUNDS"-AND JUDICIAL RULINGS ON CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ARE AT RISK OF OCCASIONAL DEFIANCE-IS ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE WITH RULE-OF-LAW IDEALS. IN OUR CURRENT POLITICAL CONTEXT, THERE IS ABUNDANT GROUND FOR ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF RULE-OF-LAW CONSTITUTIONALISM. BUT JUDICIAL SUPREMACY IS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL, OR POLITICAL PROBLEM. AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE WILL REQUIRE REPAIR OF THE ETHICAL COMMITMENTS -AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH-THAT THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES.
885	HUMANS ARE EXTENDING THEIR ACTIVITIES INTO OUTER SPACE, AND PARTICULARLY MINING SPACE RESOURCES. IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A RULE OF LAW TO REGULATE THOSE ACTIVITIES TO AVOID RISKS OF BAD PRACTICE AND CONFLICT AND TO PROVIDE THE LEGAL CERTAINTY AND A WIDE SHARING OF BENEFITS. THIS ARTICLE NOTES THAT THE PRESENT TREATY REGIME FOR OUTER SPACE IS NOT FIT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND DISCUSSES WHAT A RULE OF LAW FOR MINING IN OUTER SPACE MIGHT LOOK LIKE, DRAWING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF AUSTRALIAN MINING LAW.
886	SCHOLARS DISAGREE OVER THE NATURE, EXTENT, AND DIRECTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. UNLIKE RESEARCHERS WHO SEE CHINA'S RULE OF LAW SITUATION AS EITHER STATIC OR STEADILY IMPROVING, THIS ARTICLE TRACES THE USE, MEANING, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FAZHI ((SIC)(SIC), LITERALLY "LAW GOVERNS," USUALLY TRANSLATED AS "RULE OF LAW") AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN CHINA SINCE 1978. IT ARGUES THAT THE REAL MEANING OF FAZHI HAS CHANGED OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS. CORRESPONDINGLY, CHINA'S JOURNEY TOWARDS THE SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW EXPERIENCED SOME TURNS. CHINA WENT FROM LAYING DOWN A FOUNDATION FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN THE LATE 1970S AND 1980S, TO TURNING TO RULE BY LAW IN THE 1990S AND 2000S, AND THEN TO USING LAW TO LEGITIMIZE THE RULE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY IN THE 2010S AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM BECAME MORE MATURE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED. THIS ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM, SOCIALIST RULE OF LAW TURNS OUT TO BE THE RULE OF MAN, WITH TIGHTENED LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHARPENED LEGAL TOOLS, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO HOPED THAT THE KEY PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN THE 1980S AND INCREASED AWARENESS OF RIGHTS MAY BRING ABOUT TRANSFORMATION IN THE FUTURE.
887	IN PLAINTIFF S157/2002 V COMMONWEALTH (2003) 211 CLR 476, THE HIGH COURT HELD THAT S 75(V) OF THE CONSTITUTION ENTRENCHES A MINIMUM PROVISION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW WHICH LIMITS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STATUTORY ATTEMPTS TO IMPAIR THE JUDICIAL REVIEW OF COMMONWEALTH ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION AND CONSTITUTES A TEXTUAL REINFORCEMENT OF THE "RULE OF LAW". THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES TWO POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH THE RULE OF LAW MIGHT GIVE CONTENT TO THE IDEA OF THE MINIMUM PROVISION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW. THE ARTICLE PROCEEDS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH COURTS REASONS IN COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION V FUTURIS CORP LTD (2008) 237 CLR 146 AND ARGUES THAT NEITHER OF THE SUGGESTED APPROACHES TO THINKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW IS LIKELY TO GENERATE A CLEARLY DEMARCATED MINIMUM PROVISION OF JUDICIAL REVIEW APPLICABLE TO ALL STATUTORY CONTEXTS. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES TWO DISTINCT STATUTORY TECHNIQUES AIMED AT RESTRICTING JUDICIAL REVIEW - PRIVATIVE CLAUSES AND NO-INVALIDITY CLAUSES - AND IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGE POSED BY NO-INVALIDITY CLAUSES TO THE RULE-OF-LAW PURPOSE THE HIGH COURT HAS ATTRIBUTED TO S 75(V).
888	THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A CRITICAL COMMENTARY ON CHINA'S SITUATION AND FUTURE FOR THE MONTHS OF THE GENERATIONAL POWER TRANSFER AT THE END OF 2012 AND THE START OF 2013. THE POWER TRANSFER 2012-2013 IS SURROUNDED BY AN INCREASINGLY INSTABLE DOMESTIC SITUATION WHERE A SEEMINGLY OUTSTANDINGLY SUCCESSFUL, BUT LATELY SCANDAL-RIDDEN GENERATION OF "META-COMMUNIST" LEADERS IS PASSING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON TO A GENERATION OF MIXED EXPECTATIONS, ECLATANT SHORTFALLS AND POOR VISIBILITY. IT HAS NEVERTHELESS RAISED HOPES FOR A "META-COMMUNIST" LIBERALIZATION OR EVEN DEMOCRATIZATION. DISSIDENTS, MEMBERS OF CIVIL SOCIETY AND NON-CHINESE POLITICIANS HAVE RARELY BEEN AS OPTIMISTIC AS TODAY DURING RECENT HISTORICAL TRANSITION PERIODS. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO THESE HOPES, THERE SEEMS TO BE A TENDENCY TO RETURN TO A "PURE" NEO-COMMUNISM AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE RULING PARTY. COUNTERING THE "NAIVELY REALISTIC" EXPECTATIONS OF DEMOCRATIZATION, WE PURSUE A MORE CONSTRUCTIVIST HYPOTHESIS IN OUR ARTICLE. IN LIGHT OF THE GIVEN HISTORICAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY, IT WOULD BE MORE PROMISING TO PURSUE A MODERATE STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TOWARD A CULTURALLY AND CONTEXTUALLY ADEQUATE LIBERALIZATION INSTEAD OF HOPING FOR A "QUICK DEMOCRATIZATION". INITIALLY, THE RUDIMENTARY (INTERNALLY AS WELL AS EXTERNALLY NON-SYSTEMATIC AND ASYMMETRIC) "META-COMMUNISM" SHOULD BE STABILIZED. THE SECOND STEP WOULD BE TO IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF LAW, THEN, CHARACTERISTICS OF ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, AND FINALLY, THE PHASE OF CULTURALLY AND CONTEXTUALLY ADEQUATE DEMOCRATIZATION SHOULD COMMENCE. HOWEVER, THE STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH ALSO ENTAILS PROBLEMS AND APORIAS. THESE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE. OVERALL, WE FIRST ASK HOW A MORE "MODERATE" INSTEAD OF AN "AGGRESSIVE" REALISM COULD PREVAIL IN THE ANTICIPATIONS OF CHINA'S FUTURE AND SECOND, HOW THIS REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE COULD BUILD ON CURRENT, SPECIFIC SOCIAL PHENOMENA IN " THE MIDDLE KINGDOM".
889	JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS TRADITIONALLY DEEMED TO ENSURE CITIZENS ABOUT THE IMPARTIALITY OF ADJUDICATION AND, BY DOING SO, TO GUARANTEE THE LEGITIMACY OF THE AUTHORITATIVE ALLOCATION OF POWER THAT IS EXERCISED BY A NON-ELECTIVE ACTOR, THAT IS, THE JUDGE. HOWEVER, DESPITE ITS RELEVANCE, THIS CONCEPT IN ITSELF CANNOT CAST A PROPER LIGHT ON THE DYNAMICS AND THE LOGICS OF ACTION JUDICIAL ACTORS FOLLOW IN PROSECUTING AND ADJUDICATING CASES. IN THIS PAPER, THE AUTHOR RETAINS THIS JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY, WITH ITS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS, AND ARGUES THAT THIS MAY PROVIDE PROMISING INSIGHTS ON JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ON THE TYPE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM EXHIBITED BY A COUNTRY OR, AS PROVED IN THE LAST SECTION OF THE PAPER, IN A MULTILEVEL SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE, AS THE EU. THE PAPER ASSOCIATES THE RECONSTRUCTION OF JUDICIAL GOVERNANCE WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF DEMOCRATIC QUALITY.
890	THE GREGORIAN REVOLUTION INTRODUCED THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WEST AND CREATED NECESSARY (BUT NOT SUFFICIENT) CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH TO TAKE OFF. THIS PAPER ANALYZES SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES PROVOKED BY THE EVOLUTION IN THE NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW-FROM BEING BASED UPON GOD-GIVEN NATURAL LAW TO RELYING ON POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY. IT CONCLUDES THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW, OF THE DIFFERENCES IN LEGAL SYSTEMS AND OF CONSTITUTIONS IS PROBABLY OVERSTATED. IT SUGGESTS THAT THE SUCCESSOR TO THE MEDIEVAL NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS IN FACT A MIX OF PROCEDURAL POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, SOCIAL PREFERENCES AND EFFICIENCY. AS A RESULT THE MAIN PLAYER BECOMES THE JUDICIARY, WHOSE BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS SHOULD BECOME THE OBJECT OF FURTHER ANALYSIS.
891	A PROMINENT QUESTION IN THE LITERATURE ON DEMOCRACY IS CONCERNED WITH THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL FACTORS IN STIMULATING THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND UPLOADING RULE OF LAW. THIS PAPER TACKLES THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: HOW DOES THE POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY OF AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION-THE EU IN THIS CASE-STIMULATE DEMOCRACY IN THIRD COUNTRIES? EQUALLY IMPORTANT, DOES CONDITIONALITY ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT AND COULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO WITNESS THE EU UNDERMINING DEMOCRACY IN AN UNEXPECTED MANNER? THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THESE QUESTIONS THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF THE TURKISH DEMOCRACY IN THE LIGHT OF ITS ACCESSION TO THE EU AND THROUGH AN APPLICATION OF THE EU MEMBERSHIP CONDITIONALITY BY LOOKING AT RULE OF LAW IN TURKEY. THE GENERAL CONTENTION IN THE POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY LITERATURE IS THAT THE EU ENABLES AN ACCEDING COUNTRY TO ADOPT ITS DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AND FACILITATES TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY, WHILE STRENGTHENING RULE OF LAW. HOWEVER, THE TURKISH TRANSFORMATION SEEMS TO CHALLENGE THIS CONTENTION. THIS PAPER PROPOSES THAT THE EU'S POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY IN BRINGING ABOUT POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION IN TURKEY AS A MEMBERSHIP PRECONDITION UNEXPECTEDLY ILLUMINATED THE UNDERLYING ANTI-DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES AND TENSIONS IN TURKISH POLITICS. THE DEMOCRATIZATION PROCESS IN TURKEY SINCE 1999, PARTLY STIMULATED BY THE EU, HAS OPENED UP A PANDORA'S BOX RELEASING THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE SECULARISTS AND RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES IN TURKEY THAT HAS LONG BEEN SUPPRESSED. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THESE CLEAVAGES THROUGH THE PRISM OF EU POLITICAL CONDITIONALITY WITH REGARDS TO RULE OF LAW.
892	ALTHOUGH CHINA REMAINS CONSISTENT IN ITS STANCE AND PRACTICE IN UNILATERAL SANCTIONS EPISODES, ITS 'DECADE OF SANCTIONS' HAS WITNESSED SOME SUBTLE CHANGES-IN PARTICULAR, ITS ENDEAVOUR TO BUILD A RULE-OF-LAW-BASED UNILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME. BOTH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE DOMESTIC LAW OF CHINA PROVIDE FOR ITS UNILATERAL SANCTIONS. IT IS WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF CHINA TO TAKE UNILATERAL SANCTIONS AS LONG AS IT IS NOT AGAINST ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL LAW, BUT ITS DOMESTIC LAW SHOWS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INSUFFICIENCY. THE ADMINISTRATIVE NATURE OF UNILATERAL SANCTIONS DECIDES THE CORE PARAMETER OF DUE PROCESS FOR A RULE-OF-LAW-BASED UNILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME, WHICH HAS ITS BOUNDARIES: THE LIMIT OF LAW AS A REGULATORY REGIME FOR UNILATERAL SANCTIONS AS POLITICAL INSTRUMENT AND THE LIMIT OF DOMESTIC JURISDICTION IN TERMS OF EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION. TO UPGRADE THE UNILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME ACCORDING TO ITS OWN CONCEPT OF RULE OF LAW IN FOREIGN RELATIONS, CHINA NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE COMPATIBILITY AMONG CURRENT LAWS AND TO PROVIDE PROPER REMEDIES.
893	MASS PROTESTS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST DECADE IN VARIOUS WESTERN DEMOCRACIES HAVE CALLED INTO QUESTION THE ROLE OF POLICE IN SOCIETY, AS OFFICERS HAVE EMPLOYED MEASURES TO CONTAIN RALLIES PROTESTING FOR OR AGAINST VARIOUS ISSUES. A NUMBER OF THESE PROTESTS HAVE RESORTED TO VIOLENT MEANS, RESISTING THE POLICE OR PROTESTING DIRECTLY AGAINST THEIR ROLE AND METHODS. THE PRESENT STUDY SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE PROTOTYPICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE POLICE THAT LAY CITIZENS USE TO FORGE OR DESIST IDENTIFICATION WITH POLICE OFFICERS. SOCIAL IDENTIFICATION ENABLES CITIZENS TO CONSIDER THE POLICE AS INGROUP MEMBERS, FACILITATING RESPECT FOR THEIR AUTHORITY. CONVERSELY, IDENTIFYING THE POLICE AS OUTGROUP PRECIPITATES RESISTANCE. THE STUDY INVOLVED 41 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS CARRIED OUT WITH CITIZENS OF MALTA BETWEEN MAY AND JUNE 2020. THEMATIC NETWORKS ANALYSIS REVEALED VARIOUS POINTS OF CONSENSUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL THEMES. IN PARTICULAR, RESPONDENTS DEMONSTRATED SCEPTICAL ATTITUDES REGARDING POLICING ON THE BEAT FOR FEAR OF OVERFAMILIARITY, ROOTED IN INTROSPECTIVE ATTRIBUTIONS PROJECTED AT THE POLICE AS MERELY HUMAN. MOREOVER, RESPONDENTS EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT OVERCOME NATURAL PSYCHOLOGICAL TENDENCIES. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT SEEKING INCREASING TRUST IN THE POLICE MAY BE A RED HERRING FOR POLICYMAKERS. RATHER, EFFORTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT DEVELOPING INTER-OBJECTIVE SYSTEMS, (E.G. BODY-CAMS), THAT OVERCOME INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PROPENSITIES.
894	SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE IDEA OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE, THE PROBLEMS OF ITS FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION OF PROGRESSIVE COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS HUMANITIES SCHOLARS. DURING THE YEARS OF PERESTROIKA, FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROSPECTIVE LEGAL CONSTRUCTION, V. S. NERSESYANTS FORMULATED THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES AND COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE, WITHOUT WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW STATE IS IMPOSSIBLE. WELL-KNOWN HISTORICAL EVENTS LED TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMATION OF A NEW LEGAL SPACE ON THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF BASIC LAWS - THE CONSTITUTIONS OF THESE COUNTRIES. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL VIEWS OF V. S. NERSESYANTS ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW STATE. THE ANALYSIS REVEALING THE REFLECTION OF HIS IDEAS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA IS CARRIED OUT.
895	RESORTING TO THE "RULE OF LAW" WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL ENVIRONMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW GENERATES DIFFICULTIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE US TO SQUARE THE CIRCLE BY ACCOMMODATING NORMATIVE CLAIMS WITH STATE LEGAL ORDERS, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AND DEMOCRACY. UNSURPRISINGLY, IN RECENT CASES BROUGHT BEFORE SUPRANATIONAL COURTS, SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (KADI AND AL BAARAKAT, FOR EXAMPLE), OR DOMESTIC COURTS, SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT (HAMDAN, FOR EXAMPLE), THE IMPORT AND NOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT REVEAL THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE CONCEPT AND THE RATHER IDIOSYNCRATIC OR INSTRUMENTAL USES TO WHICH IT IS PUT. THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF SUCH INSTANCES, THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A RESTATEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW THAT BETTER EXPLAINS ITS USE BEYOND STATE BORDERS. THEN, IT SHOWS HOW THE RELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT ORDERS, AS A FACTUAL MATTER, DOES NOT OBEY SOME MONIST HIERARCHY AND DOES NOT EVEN REFLECT THE LOGIC OF THE "DUALISM" OF SELF-CONTAINED SYSTEMS. GIVEN THAT THE AUTONOMY OF LEGAL ORDERS IS A VITAL CONTEMPORARY REALITY, CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THEM AND WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW APPEARS TO BE REPLACING THE FORMAL PRIMACY OF SOURCES AS WELL AS BLIND OR DOGMATIC CLOSURE BY CONTENT-DEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENTS. IN THIS CONNECTION, A ROAD TAKEN IN THE EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT SHOWS THAT COMMUNICATIVE PLURALISM CAN EMBARK ON A PRACTICE OF GIVING REASONS INHERENTLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING COMMON STANDARDS, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THIN LINES OF PRINCIPLE. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE INGREDIENTS THAT MIGHT FINALLY EVOLVE FURTHER INTO A RULE OF RECOGNITION FOR THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER.
896	AN INHERENT TENSION EXISTS BETWEEN THE ROLES OF AGENCIES AND COURTS IN ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT CASES. THOSE CASES ARE INITIATED BY AGENCIES TO ENFORCE THE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THEY ADMINISTER BUT ARE THEN SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW BY COURTS. AGENCIES TEND TO FOCUS ON CREATING AND THEN IMPLEMENTING ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS THAT PRODUCE CONSISTENT RESULTS PURSUANT TO THE AGENCY'S BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES AND INFORMED BY THE AGENCY'S EXPERTISE. IN REVIEWING SUCH DECISIONS, BY CONTRAST, COURTS TEND TO FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THE AGENCY'S ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM COMPORTS WITH FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES. THE TWO ROLES EMBODY DIFFERENT GOALS: FOR AGENCIES, RENDERING PREDICTABLE AND CONSISTENT OUTCOMES THAT ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE STATUTE; FOR COURTS, ADHERING TO THE VALUES OF GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROTECTION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. ALL OF THESE GOALS-PREDICTABILITY, CONSISTENCY, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY, PROTECTION OF RIGHTS-REFLECT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW, THE IDEA THAT LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY REQUIRES CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES THAT ACCOMPLISH A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF FAIRNESS. EFFECTUATING THE MULTIFACETED RULE OF LAW REQUIRES CREATING A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND JUDICIAL REVIEW THAT FULLY EMPOWERS BOTH AGENCIES AND COURTS TO FULL THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES, BUT WITHOUT UNDERMINING THE OTHER.
897	THE SRI LANKAN CIVIL WAR (1983-2009) IS REGARDED AS A VIOLENT REFLECTION OF DEEPENING DIVIDES ALONG POLITICAL AND ETHNIC LINES. DURING THIS CIVIL WAR THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS SECURITY FORCES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN UNLAWFUL KILLINGS CARRIED OUT IN A PERVASIVE MANNER AGAINST CIVILIANS, WHILST AT THE SAME TIME SPECIFICALLY TARGETING ETHNIC TAMILS, HUMANITARIAN WORKERS AND JOURNALISTS. THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL CITIZENS SUFFERED AS A RESULT AND ULTIMATELY LED TO THE WEAKENING OF THE RULE OF LAW. WITH THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR, THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE LITTLE PROGRESS IN PROVIDING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WARTIME ABUSES. ITS ABSENCE OF AND RELUCTANCE TO ENSURE JUSTICE IS SEEN AS A LOGICAL CULMINATION OF DECADES OF IMPUNITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF ACKNOWLEDGING HISTORICAL BEHAVIOUR AND TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PAST VIOLATIONS WILL BE DISCUSSED. IN AN ANALYSIS FOR PAVING THE WAY TO A NEW DEMOCRACY IN SRI LANKA, THE MAIN OUTCOMES OF THIS ARTICLE ARE CALLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY ARISING OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS DURING THE WAR; AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESENT STATE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RULE OF LAW AND FINALLY; AN EXAMINATION INTO THE POLITICAL SOLUTION GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE A PROCESS OF RECONCILIATION AND PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE.
898	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ROLE OF STATES IN ESTABLISHING THE RULE OF LAW. IT IDENTIFIES SEVERAL FLAWS IN THE CURRENT INDEXES AND CALLS FOR BETTER MEASUREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW BY MAKING TWO SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS: A) THERE IS A NEED TO ACCOUNT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CITIZEN'S COMPLIANCE AS KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW AND B) MEASUREMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW SHOULD BE BASED ON HARD OR BEHAVIORAL DATA. THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES A ROAD MAP TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE PROBLEM AND PRESENTS PROMISING INITIAL DATA AND AN INDEX THAT CAPTURES THE "RULE" DIMENSION OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES. THIS REPRESENTS A BASE FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION AND DEBATE.
899	THE RULE OF LAW HAS BECOME A HOTLY DEBATED ISSUE AT EU LEVEL RECENTLY. WHAT APPEARS TO BE MISSING IN THOSE DEBATES, HOWEVER, IS ATTENTION TO THE PECULIARITIES THE RULE OF LAW PRESENTS IN THE SETUP OF THE EU'S ECONOMIC CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. THE FOUNDING EU TREATIES HAVE PUT IN PLACE SUCH FRAMEWORK PERMITTING MEMBER STATES' DIVERSIFIED (CAPITALIST) ECONOMIES TO GROW EVER CLOSER. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THAT FRAMEWORK HAS ALSO CONTINUOUSLY GIVEN RISE TO SPECIFIC RULE OF LAW CHALLENGES. THIS DIAGNOSTIC ARTICLE REVISITS AND SUMMARIZES THOSE CHALLENGES, ARGUING THAT ADDRESSING THEM IS MORE THAN EVER NECESSARY IF ONLY TO INCREASE THE EU'S LEGITIMACY IN TARGETING MORE GENERAL RULE OF LAW DEFICIENCIES IN SOME OF ITS OWN MEMBER STATES.
900	AFTER THE EXPERIENCE WITH LAW DISTORTING NATIONAL SOCIALISM AND CONFRONTED WITH EMERGING REAL SOCIALIST RULE IN EASTERN EUROPE, THE STATES OF WESTERN EUROPE SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW, AND THEREBY, HUMAN RIGHTS. ITS NORMATIVE NUCLEUS IS LAID DOWN IN THE STATUTES OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS. THIS NOT ONLY PROVIDES AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES, BUT THROUGH THE COURT'S DECISIONS GIVES RIGHTS TO A (WEST)EUROPEAN ORDRE PUBLIC BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, IN ADDITION, THE REGIME PROVIDES FOR MECHANISMS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICT ABOUT VALUES. HERE, TOO, THE PARLIAMENTARY ELEMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS OF THESE MECHANISMS ARE SHOWN WITH REFERENCE TO THE GREEK AND THE TURKISH CASES.
901	DESPITE INCREASING ATTENTION BY DONORS TO SECURITY SECTOR REFORM (SSR) AND RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT (ROL), RESULTS HAVE BEEN MIXED. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES CONDITIONS WITHIN RECIPIENT STATES THAT SHAPE THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. DRAWING FROM LITERATURE ON STATE-BUILDING, I ARGUE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITY AND JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS REFLECTS RELATIONS AMONG POLITICAL ELITES AND CITIZENS. CONCENTRATION OF POWER BY RULING ELITES AS A RESULT OF A NARROW POLITICAL BASE OR DISCRETIONARY CONTROL OVER REVENUE UNDERMINES INCENTIVES FOR LEADERS TO ACCEPT CONSTRAINTS ON EXECUTIVE POWER. REGIMES ROOTED IN BROAD OR FRAGMENTED COALITIONS WITHOUT EASY ACCESS TO REVENUE ARE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS. THE OUTCOME OF RULE OF LAW DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM PROGRAMS IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY DONORS' IMPACT ON THESE CONDITIONS. I ILLUSTRATE THESE DYNAMICS IN THREE POST-CONFLICT COUNTRIES, BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA, SIERRA LEONE AND TIMOR-LESTE, WHERE DONOR-FUNDED PROGRAMS HAVE YIELDED VARYING RESULTS.
902	THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE PHENOMENON OF DEMOCRATIC RECESSION THAT HAS LED TO A DETERIORATION OF THE LIBERAL ELEMENTS OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES. NEXT, THE EU TOOLBOX TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW AND TO REVERT THE REFORMS THAT ERODE CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES IS ANALYSED, IN PARTICULAR THOSE INTERVENTIONS FOCUSED ON THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. THE INFLUENCE OF COUNCIL OF EUROPE BODIES IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. LAST, AS A CASE STUDY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES THE ONGOING CRISIS OF THE SPANISH GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE JUDICIARY AND HOW EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS HAVE INTERVENED IN ORDER TO STOP A LEGISLATIVE REFORM THAT, IN THE EVENT OF BEING APPROVED, WOULD HAVE MEANT A SERIOUS DETERIORATION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY IN SPAIN.
903	THE ARTICLE MAPS A PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION IN THE NATURE OF THE STATE-AS-LAW IN LATIN AMERICA SINCE 1975. IN 1975, STATES HAD LEGAL ORDERS WITH LIMITED AMBITION AND LIMITED AUTONOMY FROM THE RULER OF THE DAY. THERE WERE VAST SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SPACES LEFT OPEN TO ARBITRARY DECISION MAKING. NOW THESE SPACES HAVE SHRUNK, AND STATE ORDER HAD BECOME MORE FORMALIZED. WE CAN NOW DISTINGUISH FOUR MODELS OF STATE-AS-LAW, DEPENDING ON THE DENSITY AND AUTONOMY OF THE STATE'S LEGAL ORDER: THE ORIGINAL MODEL (AN ESTADO POLITICO) SURVIVES IN A VERY FEW STATES, AND THREE NEW MODELS HAVE EMERGED, AN ESTADO SOCIAL DE DERECHO, AN ESTADO LIBERAL DE DERECHO, AND AN ESTADO DE DERECHO POLITIZADO.
904	URBAN COMMUNITIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURY WITH THE AID OF LEGAL CONCEPTS THAT COMPRISED EARLY NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW. CITIES WERE ENVISAGED AS "COMMUNES", WHICH REFERRED TO POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY. IN A FIRST PERIOD, URBAN CITIZENSHIP WAS FLEXIBLE AND CLOSELY RELATED TO PLACE OF RESIDENCE. FROM AROUND 1220 THIS MODEL CAME UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE. IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THE INTERESTS OF THE MOST AFFLUENT CITIZENS, LARGE GUILDS WERE ESTABLISHED. STATUS DETERMINED RIGHTS, AND THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INEQUALITIES EVEN AMONG CITIZENS. IDEAS OF DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRACY AND THE CIVIC VIRTUES OF CITIZENSHIP WERE FOSTERING REFORMS AFTER 1250. EXISTING URBAN GOVERNMENTS WERE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE COUNCILS AND BURGOMASTERS. A FRAMEWORK OF CHECKS AND BALANCES DEVELOPED BECAUSE THE COMMUNE, NOW CONSIDERED AS THE BODY OF CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS, WAS SEEN AS A FORCE COEXISTING WITH METROPOLITAN INSTITUTIONS. THE MEDIEVAL EXAMPLES SHOW THAT, IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC AND EVEN GLOBAL CONDITIONS, COMMUNITY-BUILDING AND RULE-OF-LAW THINKING WERE SOLUTIONS OFFERING A "UNITY-IN-DIVERSITY".
905	WHAT EFFECT DO POWER-SHARING INSTITUTIONS AGREED TO AS PART OF CIVIL WAR SETTLEMENTS HAVE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN POST-CIVIL WAR STATES? WE CONTEND THAT POWER-SHARING MEASURES FACILITATE THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, THEY ESTABLISH A FORM OF INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINT THAT PROMOTES JUDICIAL AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE. SECOND, THEY FOSTER A SENSE OF SECURITY AMONG JUDGES AND OTHER POLITICAL ACTORS THAT BOLSTERS COMMITMENT TO THE LAW. WE DEMONSTRATE THE PLAUSIBILITY OF A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POWER SHARING AND THE RULE OF LAW THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF POST-CIVIL WAR STATES BETWEEN THE YEARS 1948 AND 2006. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT CIVIL WAR SETTLEMENTS CAN HELP TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW WHEN THEY INCLUDE MECHANISMS AIMED AT ALLAYING THE INSECURITIES OF POLITICAL ACTORS IN THE POSTCONFLICT ENVIRONMENT.
906	THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT A PICTURE OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION IN VIETNAM AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REFORM PROCESS. AS VIETNAM INTEGRATES ITSELF FULLY INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CONTINUALLY URGES VIETNAM TO CHANGE ITS SYSTEM TO ADHERE TO THE RULE OF LAW. ALTHOUGH THE DEFINITION OF 'RULE OF LAW' IS STILL SUBJECT TO DEBATE, IT IS WIDELY AGREED THAT A RULE-OF-LAW SOCIETY IS ONE IN WHICH LAW IS TRANSPARENT, COHERENT, CONSISTENT, AND UNDERSTANDABLE. IN THESE SYSTEMS, LEGAL INTERPRETATION IS IMPORTANT IN ENSURING THAT LAW IS APPLIED EQUALLY TO EVERYONE. EFFICIENT LEGAL INTERPRETATION, IN TURN, REQUIRES CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS AND PRINCIPLES. I WILL EXAMINE THESE ISSUES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE VIETNAMESE TRANSITIONAL LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE LAW IS NOT NECESSARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ENFORCEABILITY AND LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND EXPLANATION ARE STILL TREATED AS PROCESSES SUPPLEMENTARY TO LAWMAKING. THE PAPER STARTS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM, AS THIS IS THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH LEGAL INTERPRETATION OPERATES. IT WILL THEN ASSESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT INFORM AND SHAPE LEGAL INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING LEGISLATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS, COMMUNITY NORMS AND TRADITIONAL PRACTICE, AND INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE.
907	THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR) WORKS INCREASINGLY IN SOCIETIES WHERE CONFLICT OR HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS OF MASSIVE PROPORTIONS HAVE VERY MUCH RELATIVIZED THE NOTION OF RULE OF LAW. THESE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINERY OF PROTECTION AND JUSTICE SIMPLY DO NOT EXIST, OR WHERE THEY DO EXIST, HAVE LOST THEIR LEGITIMACY. IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL OUTCOMES FOR THEIR PERSECUTED, ATTACKED, OR TERRORIZED POPULATIONS, THE RELEVANCE OF RULE OF LAW HAS TO BE PAINFULLY RECONSTRUCTED, INSTITUTION BY INSTITUTION, LAW BY LAW, AND CAPACITY BY CAPACITY. UNHCR CONTRIBUTES TO THIS EFFORT, BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOLUTIONS OR PROTRACTED EXILE FOR REFUGEES, AND IF REFUGEE ISSUES GO UNRESOLVED, THE PROSPECTS FOR REAL AND LASTING PEACE ARE MUCH DIMINISHED. THE ARTICLE GIVES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA, EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES THE UNHCR FACES, STRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIORITIZING THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, AND OUTLINES SOME LESSONS LEARNED. PARTICULAR CHALLENGES INCLUDE COMPETING JUSTICE SYSTEMS, THE TENSIONS BETWEEN "TOP DOWN" AND "BOTTOM UP" APPROACHES, AND THE ISSUES OF LAND RIGHTS AND THE FIGHT AGAINST IMPUNITY.
908	THE CHICAGO SCHOOL ADVANCED A PARTICULAR CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND ECONOMICS IN ANTITRUST THAT HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD FOR DECADES. A WELL-KNOWN CONSEQUENCE FOR US ANTITRUST OF THEIR SCHOLARSHIP WAS FOR GREATER DETERMINATIONS OF LEGALITY THROUGH THE AD HOC, CONDUCT-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS OF THE RULE OF REASON STANDARD, INSPIRING ADVOCACY FOR A SIMILARLY "MORE ECONOMIC" APPROACH TO EU COMPETITION LAW. BUT ALTHOUGH SUPPORTING THE SUBSTANTIVE ECONOMIC OUTCOMES OF OVERTURNING RULES OF PER SE ILLEGALITY, BORK, POSNER, EASTERBROOK, AND OTHER CHICAGOANS ROUTINELY AND CONSISTENTLY REJECTED THIS FORM OF MARKET INTERVENTION FOR DETERMINING LEGALITY. RATHER THAN EX POST EFFECTS-BASED ANALYSIS, THE CHICAGOAN APPROACH WAS TO INCORPORATE ECONOMICS EX ANTE INTO THE DESIGN OF GENERALIZED NORMS (RULES, PRESUMPTIONS, STRUCTURED TESTS) TO THEREBY FOSTER LEGAL CERTAINTY AND ADMINISTRABILITY, VIRTUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW. THE OVERLOOKED IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMAL RULE OF LAW IDEAL CAN BE DISCERNED FROM BORK AND EASTERBROOK'S ANTITRUST WRITING, POSNER'S ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW, AND EVEN TRACED BACK TO THE FOUNDATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP OF THE CHICAGO SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS. REEMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF LEGAL FORM IN CHICAGOAN WRITING CHALLENGES THEIR COMMON CONTEMPORARY PORTRAYAL, SUPPORTERS OF A PARTICULAR VERSION OF "MORE ECONOMIC" EUROPEAN ENFORCEMENT, AND THE SUPPOSEDLY "NEO"-CHICAGO APPROACH.
909	IMPERSONALITY IS FREQUENTLY INVOKED AS A CORE ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DISCUSS A TROIKA OF VALUES AND INSTITUTIONS-OFFICE, HONOUR, AND THE OATH-THAT PROVIDE DEEPLY PERSONAL SPRINGS FOR THE CONDUCT OF JUDGES AND OTHER OFFICE-HOLDERS. IN SO DOING, THESE INSTITUTIONS MAKE POSSIBLE THE SORT OF IMPERSONALITY VALUED BY THE RULE OF LAW. A FOCUS ON OFFICE EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF DUTY RATHER THAN POWER. HONOUR IS THE DESIRE TO BE WELL THOUGHT OF BY OTHERS, AND THE INTERNALIZED DESIRE TO DESERVE TO BE THOUGHT WELL OF BY OTHERS, ESPECIALLY ONE'S PEERS. HONOUR IS OFTEN TREATED AS AN OBSOLETE VALUE THAT HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY DIGNITY. BUT IT REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL FORCE, PROVIDING JUDGES AND OTHER OFFICE-HOLDERS WITH A SOURCE OF ENERGY AND AGENCY THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO FULFIL THE DUTIES OF THEIR OFFICE WITH VIRTUE AND EXCELLENCE. THE OATH SERVES AS A LINCHPIN THAT CONNECTS THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE OFFICE AND THE OFFICE-HOLDER TO THE COMMITMENT TO SERVE HONOURABLY. TAKEN TOGETHER, THIS TROIKA OF INSTITUTIONS ENCOURAGES THE FAITHFUL AND ENERGETIC PERFORMANCE OF ONE'S JUDICIAL OFFICE IN A MODERN DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTIONAL SOCIETY. THINKING ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW THIS WAY ENCOURAGES US TO SHIFT OUR FOCUS FROM POWER TO DUTY, AND FROM DOCTRINE TO CHARACTER AND VIRTUE. IT ENCOURAGES US TO REVIVE AND REVISE HONOUR RATHER THAN ABANDON IT. IT HELPS SHOW THAT AN IMPERSONAL "GOVERNMENT OF LAWS AND NOT MEN" IS AND ULTIMATELY MUST BE DEEPLY PERSONAL.
910	THIS PAPER OFFERS TO CONTEST THE IDEA THAT MAGNA CARTA WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE RULE OF LAW. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE RULE OF LAW HAD EXISTED FOR OVER TWO MILLENNIA BEFORE THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT CHARTER OF 1215. DEFINING THE NOTION OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW, IT WILL ALSO SHOW THAT THE CONCEPT AS WE NOW KNOW IT HAS BEEN EVOLVING SINCE ANTIQUITY - FROM THE TIME OF THE CODE OF HAMMURABI, MOSAIC LAW, THROUGH ARISTOTLE TO THE PRESENT UN CHARTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS. WHAT IS CLEAR IN HISTORY IS THAT EACH JURISDICTION HAS DEVELOPED AT ITS OWN PACE IN ADOPTING THE ANCIENT PRINCIPLE OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAW TO ENHANCE ITS OWN PROSPERITY. IN PARTICULAR, THE ANGLO-AMERICAN WORLD PERPETUATED SLAVERY AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTISES IN SPITE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, UNTIL ITS DUPLICITY MADE SLAVERY UNWORKABLE. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE EVOLUTION OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL CONTINUE AS THE WORLD FACES NEW CHALLENGES AND CIVILISATIONS CHANGE HANDS. WHILST, IT IS CLEARLY THE CASE THAT THE WEST HAS PRODUCED SOME OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, THERE IS NOW SERIOUS PRESSURE BEING EXERTED BY SOME WESTERN NATIONS ON NEWER DEMOCRACIES TO ADOPT THE PRACTICE THAT DRAWS DIRECTLY FROM THE WESTERN RHETORIC OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO ESTABLISH THAT THE CURRENT STANDARDS NOW OBTAINING IN THE WEST HAVE EVOLVED OVER TIME AND THERE IS MERIT IN SUPPORTING NEWER DEMOCRACIES TO FEEL THEIR WAY TO THESE ACCEPTED 'NORMS'. THIS SHOULD BE DONE BY WAY OF INTELLECTUAL DEBATE ON THE MERITS OF THE NECESSARY CHANGE RATHER THAN COERCION, THREATS AND BULLYING THAT IS NOW CHARACTERISING THE BEHAVIOUR OF CERTAIN WORLD POWERS. THIS PAPER MAKES AN URGENT CALL TO NEWER DEMOCRACIES TO ENGAGE THE RULE OF LAW, BECAUSE THE IT IS THE BEDROCK OF PROGRESS, TRADE AND INVESTMENTS. IN SHORT, THERE CAN BE NO CIVILISATION WITHOUT ADHERENCE TO THE CODE AND ETHICS OF THE RULE OF LAW.
911	MARTTI KOSKENNIEMI IS CORRECT TO VIEW HUGO GROTIUS AS A THINKER COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW. BUT THERE IS A CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROTIUS' AND KOSKENNIEMI'S RESPECTIVE CONCEPTS OF THE RULE OF LAW. GROTIUS' CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NORMATIVE AND REQUIRES A MORAL COGNITIVIST OUTLOOK. KOSKENNIEMI, ON THE OTHER HAND, HOLDS A SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW. KOSKENNIEMI IS CORRECT THAT, FOR THE RULE OF LAW TO FIND ITS 'NORMATIVE VOICE', GROTIUS MAY WELL BE OF HELP. FOR THIS NORMATIVE VOICE TO MAKE ITSELF HEARD, HOWEVER, IT WILL HAVE TO RISE ABOVE THE SCEPTICAL REDUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW TO NORMATIVELY INERT SOCIOLOGICAL FACTS.
912	CONCEPTUALISING THE EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW-VALUE - A CRITIQUE OF THE CONCEPT OF EUROPEAN LEGAL COMMUNITY - A CONCEPTUALISATION OF TRUST FOR A FRESH UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW- VALUE - TRUST RESEARCH IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES - THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE EUROPEAN RULE OF LAW IN LIGHT OF CALLS FOR BREAKING UP THE CURRENT ORDER
913	IN A SUDDEN EMERGENCY, SUCH AS A TERROR ATTACK OR AN EARTHQUAKE, THE GOVERNMENT USUALLY ASSUMES EXTRA POWERS. THESE EXTRA POWERS MAY, HOWEVER, BECOME A THREAT AGAINST THE LIBERTIES OF CITIZENS. MOST COUNTRIES HAVE TRIED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY ENACTING SPECIAL EMERGENCY LAWS. IN THIS ARTICLE, IT IS ARGUED THAT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF A CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. DRAWING ON THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON CRISIS MANAGEMENT AND ON CONSTITUTIONAL THEORY, I EXPLORE HOW CHECKS AND BALANCES WORK DURING EMERGENCIES.
914	ALTHOUGH CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCHOLARS CONTINUE TO DEBATE THE OVERALL VALUE OF THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE, BROAD CONSENSUS PREVAILS THAT REQUIRING CRIMES TO BE DEFINED IN SPECIFIC TERMS REDUCES LAW ENFORCEMENT DISCRETION. A FEW SCHOLARS HAVE QUESTIONED THIS ASSUMPTION, BUT THE CONVENTIONAL VIEW REMAINS DOMINANT. THIS ARTICLE INTENDS TO RESOLVE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE VOID-FOR-VAGUENESS DOCTRINE REALLY REDUCES POLICE DISCRETION. IT FOCUSES ON TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT, A CONTEXT IN WHICH LAWS ARE BOTH SPECIFIC AND SUBJECT TO DISCRETIONARY ENFORCEMENT. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT SPECIFIC RULES DO NOT CONSTRAIN DISCRETION UNLESS JUDICIAL LIMITS ARE PLACED EITHER ON THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT MAY BE CRIMINALIZED OR ON POLICE AUTHORITY TO UNDER-ENFORCE THE LAWS. THE ARTICLE ALSO ARGUES THAT THE SUPREME COURT'S RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC-RULE DISCRETION IS INADEQUATE. THE COURT REASSURES US THAT THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE PROTECTS AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER, THE COURT FAILS TO APPRECIATE THAT ANTIDISCRIMINATION REVIEW IS INHERENTLY INEFFECTIVE WHEN APPLIED TO BROADLY DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS. LEGISLATURES HAVE THUS CIRCUMVENTED EXISTING DOCTRINAL CONSTRAINTS ON DELEGATING DISCRETION, BUT THE COURT HAS FAILED TO DEVELOP AN ADEQUATE DOCTRINAL RESPONSE. FINALLY, THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS SOME REMEDIAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF ITS ANALYSIS. ULTIMATELY, THE ARTICLE ARGUES, JUDICIAL CHECKS ON SPECIFIC-RULE ENFORCEMENT ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND CRIME CONTROL IN A CONSTITUTIONAL REGIME COMMITTED TO THE RULE OF LAW.
915	THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR RE-EXAMINING THE CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW SO AS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF RECENT HISTORICAL CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER AND CONTEXT OF REGULATION. THE AIM IS TO BE ABLE TO RELATE THE CONCEPT DIRECTLY TO CONTEMPORARY REGULATORY PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS. A CORE OF MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW INVOKES VALUES OF EQUALITY, INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND SECURITY. NEUMANN'S SOCIOLOGICAL STUDY OF LEGALITY PROVIDES A BASIS FOR EXAMINING ASPECTS OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW, SEEN AS AN INTEGRATION OF THESE VALUES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF LEGALITY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE NEUMANN'S TIME, BUT THAT THE RULE OF LAW AND ITS COMPONENT VALUES REMAIN IMPORTANT. THE PURSUIT OF THESE VALUES REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF CERTAIN UNIVERSAL PROTECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS, THE PROMOTION OF DECENTRALIZATION AND FORMS OF COMMUNITY SELF-REGULATION, AND THE CREATION OF SPECIFIC CONTROLS ON CORPORATE ECONOMIC POWER.
916	THE WRITTEN NATURE OF AMERICA'S CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN TRADITIONALLY REGARDED AS A CONSTITUTIONAL VIRTUE, AND MORE RECENTLY DISMISSED AS AN IRRELEVANCY OF FORM. HOWEVER, THE CONCEPT OF "WRITTENNESS" ITSELF, IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT, REMAINS VAGUE AND UNDEFINED. THROUGH A COMPARISON OF THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED KINGDOM CONSTITUTIONS, THIS NOTE IDENTIFIES THE ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION AND EXAMINES HOW SUCH WRITTENNESS AFFECTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN A SOCIETY. THE NOTE ARGUES THAT AN UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION MAY PROVE AS CONDUCIVE TO IMPORTANT RULE-OF-LAW VALUES AS A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION, IF NOT MORE SO, AND CHALLENGES THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF WRITTENNESS AS AN UNEQUIVOCALLY DESIRABLE ASPECT OF OUR CONSTITUTION.
917	THIS ARTICLE SUMMARIZES THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OF PRESIDENTS SUBJECTED TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL INVESTIGATIONS, AND COMPARES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR TO THEIRS. IT CONCLUDES THAT WHILE TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR IS PART OF A LARGER PATTERN OF PRESIDENTIAL USE OF VARIOUS EXECUTIVE PREROGATIVES TO TRY TO COUNTERACT INDEPENDENT COUNSELS, IT DEPARTS FROM THAT PATTERN IN SEVERAL DISTINCT WAYS. I CONCLUDE THAT SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BROADER POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO HIS DISTINCTIVE BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING THE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED MEDIA MARKET, THE DEGREE OF PARTISAN POLARIZATION IN THE ELECTORATE, THE CONSERVATIVE POPULIST DISTRUST OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND THE MAINSTREAMING OF THE UNITARY EXECUTIVE THEORY IN THE COURTS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
918	THE LATE E.P. THOMPSON DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS 'A HISTORIAN IN THE MARXIST TRADITION'. BUT WHEN HE EMBRACED THE RULE OF LAW (IN WHIGS AND HUNTERS), MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES ON THE LEFT OSTRACIZED HIM AS AN APOSTATE. THIS ESSAY ARGUES THAT THOMPSON'S CRITICS HAVE LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT HE MEANT BY THE RULE OF LAW. HIS WAS A MINIMAL AND HISTORICAL CONCEPTION, WHICH MERELY SOUGHT TO DISTINGUISH STATES WHOSE RULERS HAD UNFETTERED DISCRETION FROM STATES M,HOSE RULERS WERE CONSTRAINED BY LEGAL RULES, WHATEVER THEIR SOURCE AND CONTENTS. ALSO, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER RADICAL THEORISTS, THOMPSON RECOGNIZED THAT LAW WOULD BE A NECESSARY INSTITUTION IN ANY COMPLEX SOCIETY, NO MATTER WHAT ITS ECONOMIC BASIS, TO MEDIATE SOCIAL RELATIONS. THE ESSAY CONCLUDES WITH SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE RELEVANCY OF THOMPSON'S CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW FOR ONGOING EFFORTS TO REVITALIZE A MORE 'RADICAL LIBERALISM'.
919	ACTIVIST JUDGES ARE OFTEN ACCUSED OF CHANGING THE RULE OF LAW INTO THE RULE OF MEN. SOME AMERICANS ARE DISTURBED BY U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT CREATE NEW LAW, INVADE STATE SOVEREIGNTY, AND IMPOSE RECENT STANDARDS FOR SEXUAL CONDUCT. THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS INVENTED THE HERETICAL DOCTRINE THAT JUDGES HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE LAW. THE MEDIEVAL COURT IMPLEMENTED NEW RULES, IGNORED THE PLAIN MEANING OF LEGISLATION, AND UNDERMINED MAGNA CARTA GUARANTEES. THIS PAPER EXPLAINS HOW A HEAD-STRONG JUDGE SEIZED POWER, AND VIOLATED TRADITIONAL RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW. HIS INNOVATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF AMERICAN JUDICIAL ACTIVISM.

920	RULE OF LAW IS A CONCEPT THAT IS REGULARLY DEBATED BY LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION TO DISCUSSION OF THE CONCEPT OF LAW. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE FOCUS IS NOT ON THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONCEPTUAL CLAIMS, BUT ON THE METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED BY LEGAL PHILOSOPHERS, INVESTIGATING SEMINAL ARTICLES ON THE RULE OF LAW BY JOSEPH RAZ AND JEREMY WALDRON. I ARGUE THAT THEIR PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTATIONS OFTEN CRUCIALLY DEPEND ON EMPIRICAL OR LEGAL DOCTRINAL ARGUMENTS. HOWEVER, THESE ARGUMENTS REMAIN UNDERDEVELOPED. I EXPLORE HOW THESE ARGUMENTS COULD BE LINKED TO APPROACHES RELATED TO RULE OF LAW IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP AND INVESTIGATE HOW THE METHODOLOGIES OF THESE FIELDS MAY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. THUS, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT FOR A SPECIFIC FORM OF TRIANGULATION OF THREE KINDS OF APPROACHES TO THE RULE OF LAW: PHILOSOPHICAL, SOCIAL-SCIENTIFIC AND LEGAL DOCTRINAL. THIS METHOD OF TRIANGULATION IS ILLUSTRATED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE WORLD JUSTICE PROJECT'S RULE OF LAW INDEX.
921	THE PAPER REVISITS THE IMPACT OF AID ON INSTITUTIONS AND DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE ILL-MATCHING OF INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPLANTS IN EXPLAINING THE REPORTED (ADVERSE) INSTITUTIONAL IMPACT OF AID. THE PAPER PROVIDES A REGRESSION ANALYSIS BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 67 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 1984-2003. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT POORLY RECEIVED INSTITUTIONAL TRANSPLANTS - AND SUBSEQUENT INSTITUTIONAL CRISES - LARGELY ACCOUNT FOR AID'S ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE RULE OF LAW IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
922	THIS PAPER EXAMINES CHURCH SANCTUARY INCIDENTS IN CANADA INVOLVING UNSUCCESSFUL REFUGEE CLAIMANTS SEEKING TO AVOID DEPORTATION. THE AUTHOR CONTENDS THAT WHEN FAITH-BASED COMMUNITIES DEVELOP FORMAL SCREENING MECHANISMS TO DETERMINE WHO AMONG THE MANY THAT REQUEST IT IS ACCORDED SANCTUARY, THEY APPLY SIMILAR NORMS AND PROCEDURES AS THOSE FOUND IN CANADA'S OFFICIAL REFUGEE DETERMINATION PROCESS. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT ALTHOUGH SANCTUARY PRACTICES ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED AS A FORM OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE THAT POSES A THREAT TO THE RULE OF LAW, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND SANCTUARY PRACTICES AS A MEANS THROUGH WHICH FAITH-BASED COMMUNITIES PREVENT THE STATE FROM VIOLATING BOTH CANADIAN AND INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE LAW, THEREBY UPHOLDING RULE-OF-LAW NORMS.
923	IN POSTCOLONIAL HONG KONG, THE RULE OF LAW INHERITED FROM THE COLONIZERS HAS ACQUIRED THE STATUS OF A GRAND NARRATIVE CAPABLE OF MASKING ITS OWN INJUSTICES. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE BY THE OCCIDENTALIZATION STRATEGIES EMPLOYED BY THOSE IN POWER, NAMELY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION. THE MAJOR INJUSTICE OF THE RULE OF LAW IS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION OF THE STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS. IT IS ARGUED THAT FOR LINGUISTIC, ETHNIC AND STRUCTURAL REASONS, REASONABLENESS AS CONSTRUED IN THE LEGAL DISCOURSE IS CULTURE-BIASED AND MARGINALIZES QING, WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE CULTURAL ROOTS OF THE HONG KONG CHINESE. THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MARGINALIZATION OF QING IS NOT LIMITED TO THE LEGAL DISCOURSE ITSELF, BUT IS FURTHER EXTENDED TO THE PUBLIC SPHERE. IN TURN, IN RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW, THE PUBLIC SPHERE IS RENDERED UNABLE TO PERFORM THE TASK OF A 'WARNING SYSTEM WITH SENSORS' AS DESIRED BY HABERMAS.
924	THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON A KEYNOTE ADDRESS GIVEN AT THE LOTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN LAW HELD AT THE FACULTY OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI, ON 20-21 NOVEMBER 2017, BY PROFESSOR MARIANNA MURAVYEVA. THE ARTICLE, WHICH REFLECTS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AT THE TIME OF ITS DELIVERY, EXPLORES THE ORIGINS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECISION TO ACCEPT RUSSIA'S APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE.
925	SINCE KOREA'S DEMOCRATIZATION IN THE LATE 1980S THERE HAS BEEN POWERFUL MOMENTUM TO REEXAMINE THE PAST AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING LITERATURE IN THE RULE OF LAW IN AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES BY DISCUSSING THE JUDICIARY OF KOREA DURING THE SO-CALLED YUSIN ERA (1972-1980). THE COURTS IN THE 1970S HAVE BEEN PLACED AT THE CENTER OF CONTROVERSY IN THE WAKE OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE, AS A NUMBER OF JUDICIAL DECISIONS WERE REOPENED AND ORIGINAL VERDICTS OVERTURNED. MOST NOTABLE WERE THE CASES INVOLVING THE SO-CALLED EMERGENCY DECREES WHICH SERVED AS A MAJOR INSTRUMENT FOR THE REGIME TO SUPPRESS POLITICAL OPPOSITION. IN DECEMBER 2010 AND MARCH 2013, THE SUPREME COURT OF KOREA AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF KOREA EACH RULED THAT THE EMERGENCY DECREES WERE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THAT THE COURTS IN THE 1970S WERE WRONG IN DECLINING TO EXERCISE THEIR JUDICIAL REVIEW POWER. THE EVOLVING JURISPRUDENCE THROUGH THE AUTHORITARIAN AND SUBSEQUENTLY DEMOCRATIC PERIODS HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN MODERN KOREA. CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE IN THE POST-DEMOCRATIZATION YEARS IN PARTICULAR BRINGS TO THE FORE THE THORNY ISSUE OF NEGOTIATING BETWEEN MOUNTING DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS AND THE EXIGENCY OF LEGAL STABILITY.
926	THE AMBITION OF THIS ARTICLE IS TWOFOLD. FIRST, IT ARGUES THAT, IN ORDER TO ENHANCE RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW BY ITS MEMBER STATES, THE EU HAS LAUNCHED A NEW STRATEGY ALBEIT ESSENTIALLY BASED ON MECHANISMS WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE RULE OF LAW. SECOND, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO CLARIFY THE NOTION OF RULE OF LAW RESULTING FROM THIS STRATEGY AND TO SUBSEQUENTLY ANALYSE ITS CONSEQUENCES. IN DOING SO, THIS ARTICLE WILL THEREBY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INSTRUMENTS USED BY THE NEW STRATEGY PROMOTE A NOTION OF THE EU RULE OF LAW WHICH IMPLIES A CONSTANT ARBITRAGE BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND THE ECONOMIC OBJECTIVES PURSUED BY THE EU. THE RISK MAY BE, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD SUBJUGATE FUNDAMENTAL VALUES (AS DEFINED IN ARTICLE 2 TEU) TO THE LOGIC OF EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION, THUS INVERTING THE HIERARCHY BETWEEN PROTECTION FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND ECONOMIC VALUES.
927	U.S. CORPORATE CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT POLICY ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO ENTER INTO DEFERRED AND NONPROSECUTION AGREEMENTS (D/NPAS) THAT IMPOSE CORPORATE REFORM MANDATES ON FIRMS WITH DETECTED MISCONDUCT. THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE PROCESS GOVERNING PROSECUTORS' USE OF D/NPA MANDATES IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW. THE RULE OF LAW REQUIRES THAT INDIVIDUAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTORS NOT BE GIVEN SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS TO ACHIEVE PERSONAL AIMS, INCLUDING IDIOSYNCRATIC CONCEPTIONS OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO SATISFY THE RULE OF LAW, MODERN GOVERNMENTS GRANTING DISCRETION TO EXECUTIVE BRANCH ACTORS CONSTRAIN THIS AUTHORITY BY LIMITING THE SCOPE OF AUTHORITY GRANTED AND REQUIRING EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF DECISIONS. FORMAL ENFORCEMENT THROUGH PLEAS AND FORMAL AGENCY RULE-MAKING EMPLOY BOTH MECHANISMS TO CONSTRAIN DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY. BY CONTRAST, PROSECUTORS WHO USE D/NPAS TO CREATE AND IMPOSE NEW DUTIES FACE FEW LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF THEIR EX ANTE AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE. THEY ALSO FACE LITTLE OVERSIGHT THROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW. THIS BROAD GRANT OF DISCRETION TO INDIVIDUAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICES IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULE OF LAW.
928	WHEN CHINA ACCEDED TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION IN 2001, PUNDITS WERE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECT THAT CHINA'S WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP WOULD BOOST INTERNATIONAL TRADE, ENCOURAGE CHINA'S RESTRUCTURING TOWARD A MARKET ECONOMY, DISCIPLINE THE DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM, AND STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA. MORE RECENTLY, HOWEVER, SERIOUS CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING CHINA'S RECORD ON THE RULE OF LAW. THE FIRST NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY REPORT ISSUED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN DECEMBER 2017 CLAIMED THAT CHINA'S INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN THE LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM HAD NOT EFFECTUATED CHINA'S DEEPER ENGAGEMENT WITH, OR RESPECT FOR, THE RULE OF LAW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO TAKE A CRITICAL LOOK AT THE TWO CONTRASTING NARRATIVES ON THE IMPACT OF THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION ON CHINA'S RULE OF LAW CONSTRUCTION OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. IT CONCLUDES THAT, ALTHOUGH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION HAS PLAYED A POSITIVE ROLE IN ADVANCING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA, SUCH A ROLE HAS LONG BEEN EXAGGERATED. ACCORDINGLY, WE PROVIDE AN ACCOUNT OF WHY THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION HAS FAILED TO PLAY A CATALYST ROLE IN INSTITUTING THE RULE OF LAW IN CHINA WIDELY EXPECTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD.
929	INSTITUTIONALISATION - POPULISM - RULE OF LAW - POLAND - HUNGARY - POST-COMMUNIST REFORMERS MORE GIVEN TO EMULATION, ADOPTION AND INSTALLATION, THAN INSTITUTIONALISATION - INSTITUTIONALISED TRADITIONS AS RESOURCES AND SOURCES OF RECALCITRANCE - NEW POPULISTS AS INSTITUTIONALISERS OF ANTI-RULE OF LAW VALUES, DE-INSTITUTIONALISERS OF INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS - 'ABUSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISTS', WHO ERODE AND SUBVERT THE KINDS OF INSTITUTIONALISATION NECESSARY TO TEMPER POWER
930	INTRODUCTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN HUNGARY - LIBERAL CONSTITUTIONALISM AS A VICTIM OF THE AUTHORITARIAN EFFORTS OF VIKTOR ORBAN'S FIDESZ PARTY AFTER THE 2010 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS - THE LEGAL GOVERNANCE OF HISTORY CONTRIBUTING TO THE BACKSLIDING OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW - USE OF MEMORY POLITICS FOR THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED AUTHORITARIAN REGIME'S OWN POLITICAL PURPOSES - TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE MEASURES TO HELP RECONCILE SOCIETY AND CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY - THE CURRENT HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF HISTORY
931	EVERY ERA HAS ITS UNIQUE CHALLENGES, BUT HISTORY MAY STILL OFFER LESSONS ON HOW LAW EMPOWERS AND RESTRAINS PRESIDENTS. THIS ESSAY EXAMINES HOW PRESIDENT LINCOLN NEGOTIATED THE TENSION BETWEEN CRISIS AUTHORITY AND THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES AN APPRECIATION OF THE WARTIME IMPERATIVES, INSTITUTIONS, AND POLITICAL FORCES CONFRONTING LINCOLN, AS WELL AS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH HE ACTED. SIMILAR ISSUES UNEXPECTEDLY AROSE IN OUR TIMES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS, PROVIDING A NEW POINT OF COMPARISON WITH LINCOLN'S ERA. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW POLITICAL ACTORS AND INSTITUTIONS, THE MEDIA, AND PUBLIC OPINION CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR LEGAL NORMS, LEST WE PLACE ALL OF OUR TRUST IN PRESIDENTIAL SELF-RESTRAINT AND GOOD JUDGMENT.
932	MOST OF THE RESEARCH ON THE RULE OF LAW IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FOCUSES ON ITS EXTERNAL DIMENSION. HOWEVER, TO BE A CREDIBLE RULE OF LAW PROMOTER ABROAD, RULE OF LAW STANDARDS AT HOME NEED TO MATCH WHAT THE EU PREACHES ABROAD. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THE AREA OF FREEDOM, SECURITY AND JUSTICE HERALDED IN 2009 AS ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STOCKHOLM PROGRAMME. TWO MECHANISMS HAD BEEN ENVISAGED. FIRST, A NEW PEER-REVIEW MECHANISM, BASED ON A DUTCH INITIATIVE, WOULD BE INTRODUCED. SECOND, AMBITIONS TO IMPROVE THE MONITORING CULTURE OF JUSTICE AND HOME AFFAIRS INSTRUMENTS FOUND SOME SUPPORT IN THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. NOT ONLY THE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE EU'S ACCESSION TO THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS SHOULD IMPROVE THE RULE OF LAW AND MUTUAL TRUST, BUT THE EU COULD ALSO BETTER MAKE USE OF THE EXISTING MONITORING INSTRUMENTS OF THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE. INTER-INSTITUTIONAL TENSIONS OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF JHA POLICIES, AS WELL AS TURBULENCES SURROUNDING THE EU'S ACCESSION TO THE ECHR HAVE NONETHELESS COME TO LIGHT AND ARE EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE.
933	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EFFORTS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION TO ADVANCE SECURITY SECTOR REFORM AND TO BRIDGE THE GAP WITH THE JUDICIARY SECTOR REFORM AND THE RULE OF LAW IN THE OCCUPIES PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. SINCE THE 1993 OSLO ACCORDS, THE EU ENGAGED ACTIVELY IN THE STATE-BUILDING PROJECT IN THE OCCUPIED PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES BY TAKING A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES IN SITU. SECURITY HAS BEEN A KEY ISSUE IN ALL ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED DURING THE POST-1993 OSLO INTERIM PERIOD UP TO 1999 AND THEN, WITH THE RESUMPTION OF THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA IN 2000, SECURITY BECAME PRIMORDIAL TO ALL INTERNATIONALLY-SPONSORED DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND PEACE PLANS. THE ARTICLE ANALYSES THE EU INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN TO HELP THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REFORM ITS SECURITY AND JUDICIARY SECTORS, AND ARGUES THAT WHILE THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS, IN THEORY, SUPPORTED THE RULE OF LAW PERSPECTIVE IN PALESTINIAN SECURITY SECTOR REFORM, IN REALITY IT HAS NOT PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO IMPROVING DEMOCRATIC CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
934	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS OF URBAN CONSTITUTIONALISM AND ITS RELATION TO THE RULE OF LAW FOR FIFTEENTH CENTURY BRUGES. LATE MEDIEVAL BRUGES WAS A CITY OF GREAT PROMINENCE WHERE SEVERAL IMPORTANT TRADE FLOWS CAME TOGETHER. PROVIDING ADEQUATE JUSTICE WAS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE ALDERMEN. SCHOLARS HAVE TRADITIONALLY STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF PRIVILEGES IN PROVIDING THIS SECURITY. PRIVILEGES GRANTED A THEORETICAL PROTECTION BUT ALSO ENTAILED OTHER DEVIATIONS FROM THE GENERAL RULE. THE GRANT OF PRIVILEGES LAY THE FOUNDATION OF AN UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF MERCHANTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT, THOUGH THESE PRIVILEGES WERE ESSENTIAL IN PROTECTING MERCHANTS, THE ALDERMEN OF BRUGES DID NOT GRANT FAR-REACHING PROCEDURAL ADVANTAGES TO MERCHANT COMMUNITIES. IN DOING SO, THE ALDERMEN OF BRUGES ENSURED THAT CERTAIN BASIC NOTIONS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO THE ALDERMEN OF BRUGES, EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE THIS COURT AND THE PREVALENCE OF FLEMISH LAW OVER FOREIGN LAW, WERE PRESENT. IN THE CITY'S BELIEF THAT PROPER JUSTICE EQUALLED THE COMMON GOOD, SOME EMBRYONIC NOTIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW BECOME APPARENT. HOWEVER, WE SHOULD NOT OVEREXTEND THIS ARGUMENT. THE CITY DEPENDED ON THESE MERCHANT COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE, THE CITY WAS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE LEVERAGE OF THE MERCHANT COMMUNITIES, THAN, FOR EXAMPLE, THE STATE. BRUGES REFUSED DEMANDS FOR PROCEDURAL ADVANTAGES FOR THE MOST PART OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY, BUT ONCE THE PRESENCE OF THESE COMMUNITIES BECAME INDISPENSABLE, THE CITY HAD TO GIVE IN AND ALTER ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK.
935	PROFESSOR THOMAS SUGGESTS THAT THE TELEVISION SERIES THE PRACTICE BREAKS FROM TRADITION BY PORTRAYING THE LAW AS ARBITRARY AND SUBJECT TO MANIPULATION. ON ONE HAND, ITS NARRATIVES SHOW THAT LAW MAY REQUIRE THE GUILTY TO BE SET FREE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LAW SOMETIMES FAILS TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT. OUTCOMES OFTEN TURN ON EXTRALEGAL FACTORS SUCH AS LUCK, RACE, OR HEROIC EFFORTS. THIS PORTRAYAL IS A "POSTMODERN" DEPICTION OF THE RULE OF LAW. THE NARRATIVES FROM THE PRACTICE DECONSTRUCT THE TRADITIONAL RULE OF LAW HIERARCHY BY SHOWING THAT THE RULE OF MAN CAN LEAD TO MORE JUST RESULTS. THE NARRATIVES SHOW GREATER PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF POSTMODERNIST IDEAS ABOUT LAW, AND MAY ENCOURAGE A GREATER SKEPTICISM IN AMERICAN CULTURE ABOUT RELIANCE ON THE RULE OF LAW.
936	HOPING TO IMPROVE LABOR JUSTICE, SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE REFORMED THEIR LABOR COURTS WITHOUT NECESSARILY BUTTRESSING WORKING-CLASS POWER. CLASS POWER THEORIES MAKE US SKEPTICAL OF THESE STATE-CENTRIC STRATEGIES FOR LABOR RIGHTS. WILL THE "RULE-OF-LAW" REFORMS WORK? THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ETHNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY THE AUTHOR IN THE CHILEAN LABOR COURTS DURING 2009-2010, AND SECONDARY SOURCES. IT COMPARES CONTEMPORARY LABOR COURTS, REFORMED BUT IN AN OTHERWISE "NEOLIBERAL" CONTEXT, WITH THE UNREFORMED LABOR COURTS OF THE "SOCIALIST" YEARS (1970-1972) TO GAUGE THE EFFICACY OF RULE-OF-LAW REFORMS. RESULTS SHOW THAT DESPITE THE NEOLIBERAL CONTEXT, THE LABOR COURTS WERE MORE RESPONSIVE TO WORKERS' CLAIMS THAN UNDER SOCIALISM. RULE OF LAW AND PROCEDURAL RULES MATTER FOR EFFECTIVE LABOR RIGHTS.
937	PTION OF THE UNCITRAL MODEL LAW ON CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY PROMOTES TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY, WHICH IN TURN SUPPORT STABIL THE RULE OF LAW IS A CONCEPT THAT WAS OFTEN CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF NATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, IT IS NOW COMMONLY BEING PROMOTED AS SIGNIFICANT IN THE TRANSNATIONAL CONTEXT. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES ITS IMPORTANCE WITHIN THE TRANSNATIONAL ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL CONTEXT, IN PARTICULAR IN RESPONSE TO CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCIES. IT EXAMINES HOW THE UNCITRAL MODEL LAW ON CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY AND ITS GUIDE TO ENACTMENT AND INTERPRETATION PROMOTE KEY TENETS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN TRANSNATIONAL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF BUSINESSES IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. IN PARTICULAR, SOME EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED OF CASES FROM THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION IN WHICH THE MODEL LAW HAS BEEN APPLIED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE RULE OF LAW MAY BE PROMOTED IN AN INSOLVENCY CONTEXT. FINALLY, THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT THE ADOITY IN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND CREDIT RELATIONSHIPS AND THUS TRADE WITHIN A GLOBAL MARKET. THIS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF ADHERENCE TO ELEMENTS OF THE RULE OF LAW PRINCIPLE. COPYRIGHT (C) 2016 INSOL INTERNATIONAL AND JOHN WILEY & SONS, LTD.

938	THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE EFFECTS OF POPULIST POLARIZATION IN CREATING STRONG AND LONG-LASTING INSTITUTIONS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW. IT FOCUSES ON POLITICS AND NOT ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF POPULISM OR OF NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION. THE FIRST SECTION BRIEFLY EXPLAINS HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE CONTESTED NOTIONS OF POPULISM AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE SECOND FOCUSES ON THE PARADIGMATIC CASE OF JUAN PERON'S FIRST TWO ADMINISTRATIONS (1946-1956) TO EXPLORE THE AMBIGUOUS LEGACIES OF POPULIST INCLUSION FOR THE CREATION OF LONG-LASTING DEMO-CRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THE THIRD SECTION FOCUSES ON HOW HUGO CHAVEZ, EVO MORALES AND RAFAEL CORREA APPEALED TO THE UN-BOUNDED WILL OF THE PEOPLE TO CONVENE PARTICIPATORY CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLIES. THE LAST SECTION FOCUSES ON ECUADOR'S POST-POPULIST SUCCESSION. DIFFERENT FROM EVO MORALES THAT WAS OUSTED BY A COUP, OR NICOLAS MADURO THAT KILLED DEMOCRACY, LENIN MORENO, WHO WAS CORREA'S FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT, ABANDONED POPULISM, DITCHED HIS MENTOR, AND USED A REFERENDUM TO CLEAN THE STATE AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS FROM CORREA'S ALLIES. APPEALING TO THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY, HIS ADMINISTRATION ASSUMED EXCEPTIONAL POWERS TO NAME NEW AUTHORITIES OF CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY. HIS INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS HOWEVER MIGHT NOT LAST BECAUSE THEY WERE BASED ON THE EXCLUSION OF CORREA AND HIS FOLLOWERS. THE CONCLUSION EXPLORES THE REASONS WHY ACTORS CONTINUE TO USE LAWS INSTRUMENTALLY MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO CREATE LONG-LASTING INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS BASED ON THE RULE OF LAW, AND HENCE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF DEEPENING DEMOCRACY.
939	THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT SYSTEM IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNITED STATES BLOCKING THE APPOINTMENT OF NEW APPELLATE BODY MEMBERS THIS MECHANISM IS IN CRISIS. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EUROPEAN UNION PROPOSALS AIMED AT UNBLOCKING THE CRISIS SITUATION. THIS REQUIRES FIRST DETERMINING BOTH THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT IN WHICH THIS CRISIS HAS ARISEN AND THE UNITED STATES CRITICISM THAT UNDERLIES ITS DECISION TO BLOCK THE FUNCTIONING OF THE APPELLATE BODY.
940	THIS PAPER TRACES THE GENEALOGY OF LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE EXPANSION OF CIVIL JURISDICTION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. IT ENDEAVOURS TO ILLUMINATE THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE CIVIL REMEDY DEVELOPMENTS IN ALIEN TORT ACTION AND GLOBALIZATION. IT ELUCIDATES THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS DEVELOPMENT, IMPLIED BY THE TRANSFORMATIONS IN SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL JURISDICTION, AS WELL AS IN LEGAL PERSONALITY, AND SUBJECTIVITY, REFLECTING UPON THE WAYS THAT THESE NORMATIVE CHANGES HELP TO CONSTITUTE GLOBAL RULE OF LAW. IT ENDS BY CONCLUDING THAT, WHATEVER THEIR CONTRIBUTION, THESE TRANSNATIONAL REMEDIES ARE BEST CONCEIVED AS COMPLEMENTARY TO THE PROTECTIONS OFFERED BY STATE LEGAL SYSTEMS.
941	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW THE ATTEMPT TO PURSUE SECURITY COUNCIL ACCOUNTABILITY RELATES TO PARALLEL EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED AND THAT STEPS TO PROMOTE ONE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REINFORCE INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE THE OTHER. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND RULE OF LAW AGENDAS IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE CLOSELY LINKED WAVES OF REFORM INITIATIVES WILL HAVE A CUMULATIVE IMPACT THAT IMPROVES THE CAPACITY OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO ACT EFFECTIVELY AND LEGITIMATELY TO MAINTAIN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. THIS MEANS STRENGTHENING THE COUNCIL'S ABILITY NOT JUST TO PURSUE THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF OTHER ACTORS, BUT TO MODEL ACCOUNTABILITY ITSELF, AND NOT SIMPLY TO PROMOTE THE RULE OF LAW ELSEWHERE, BUT TO RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW IN AND THROUGH ITS OWN DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THE ARTICLE TRACES THE EVOLUTION AND MEANING OF BOTH THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL'S PRACTICE. IT THEN EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO TERMS, ARGUING THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY SHARE A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT IS MUTUALLY REINFORCING.
942	WHOLE-PROCESS PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY PROFOUNDLY REFLECTS THE FEATURES OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS, AND COMPREHENSIVELY AND SYSTEMATICALLY REVEALS THE CONCEPT OF PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY AS PROVIDING IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF NATIONAL AND SOCIAL GOVERNANCE. BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOCRACY AS MAJORITY RULE, WHOLE-PROCESS PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY EMPHASIZES THE UNIVERSALITY AND EXTENSIVE RANGE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE, BUT ALSO HAS THE NATURAL VALUE DEFECTS OF DEMOCRATIC VALUE ITSELF. THEREFORE, WE MUST ORGANICALLY COMBINE DEMOCRACY WITH THE VALUES OF THE RULE OF LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS, TO BUILD A WELL-DEFINED GOVERNANCE ORDER BASED ON PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC VALUE. THE WHOLE PROCESS IN THE "WHOLE-PROCESS PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY" HAS REALLY RESOLVED THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE'S "ABSENCE" FROM MANY LINKS OF STATE POWER OPERATION CAUSED BY OVER-EMPHASIZING THE ELECTION-DEMOCRACY IN THE WESTERN CAPITALIST DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. THROUGH THE PEOPLE'S EXTENSIVE PARTICIPATION AND EFFECTIVE SUPERVISION, THE STATE POWER OPERATION MECHANISM BASED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POLITICAL SYSTEM, THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS SYSTEM, HAS BEEN ENSURED TO BE ALWAYS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE. THIS EFFECTIVELY REALIZES THE PEOPLE'S SOVEREIGNTY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DECLARATION THAT "ALL POWER IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE," STIPULATED IN THE CONSTITUTION OF CHINA. TO IMPROVE THE GOVERNANCE EFFICIENCY OF WHOLE- PROCESS PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY IN PRACTICE, WE MUST BRING IT ONTO THE RULE OF LAW, AND USE THE RULE OF LAW PHILOSOPHY AND METHODS TO REASONABLY AND EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE ALL KINDS OF THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PROBLEMS.
943	THE RULE OF LAW BEARS A SPECIAL MEANING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER, WHERE THERE IS NO CLEAR VERTICAL HIERARCHY OR SOVEREIGN. THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW STRIVES TO CURB THE EXCESS AUTONOMY OF INDIVIDUAL STATES FOR THE COMMON GOOD. ALTHOUGH THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SCEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW ACTUALLY EXISTS, STATES LARGELY DO BEHAVE AS IF INTERNATIONAL LAW IS TRULY "LAW", AND INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS ARE ALSO MORE ENFORCEABLE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE MOMENTS WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW IS INTERRUPTED BY MAJOR POWERS. IN AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD THAT IS BOTH CAPABLE OF AND PRONE TO INFLICTING UNIMAGINABLE DESTRUCTION, THE STRATEGY FOR SMALL STATES UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES DIRECTLY IS TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT WILL BEST PROMOTE THEIR SURVIVAL, AND THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PURSUING AND PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.
944	HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND THE DELEGATION OF POWER AND AUTHORITY - FOR EXAMPLE, FROM A POLITY TO AN ADMINISTRATOR - IN A WORLD OF FRAGMENTED GOVERNANCE? IN THIS PAPER, I INTRODUCE THE PRACTICES OF CONTEMPORARY 'RULE OF LAW' AND 'GOVERNANCE' REFORM, WHICH REFRAME THIS QUESTION IN POLITICALLY POWERFUL WAYS. THESE PRACTICES ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IN DEVELOPMENT CONTEXTS, AND BEYOND. PRACTITIONERS BEGIN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOME SORT OF ADMINISTRATION OCCURS IN THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXTS IN WHICH THEY WORK. THEY THEN FOCUS ON HOW TO CONVENE A POLITICAL COMMUNITY IN WHICH TO EMBED - AND POTENTIALLY LEGITIMATE - THAT ADMINISTRATION. THEY THEREBY RECONFIGURE THE QUESTION OF DELEGATION INTO ONE OF AUTONOMY - OR MANAGING THE EXTENT TO AND WAYS IN WHICH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGAL SYSTEM SELF-PRODUCES. IN DOING SO, I ARGUE THAT CONTEMPORARY RULE OF LAW PRACTITIONERS WIELD CONSTITUTIONAL POWER UNDER THE RUBRIC OF WORKADAY ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY EFFACE THEIR POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY.
945	IN THE AREA OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW IN GREECE, WHERE AT LEAST SINCE 1975 THERE HAS BEEN A WELL FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY, THE IDEAL OF 'MODERNISATION' MUST MEAN ADHERENCE TO THE SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES OF LEGALITY AND THE RULE OF LAW AS POLITICAL IDEALS. EVEN THOUGH THE SIMITIS GOVERNMENT SHOWED SOME CONCERN FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THESE AREAS, THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OF 2001 DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TACKLE LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS SUCH AS CIVIL SERVICE CORRUPTION, IRREGULARITIES IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT, THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY AND THE LIKE. THE AMENDMENT WAS MOTIVATED, IT SEEMS, BY A MORE MAJORITARIAN 'COMMUNITARIAN' LEGAL PHILOSOPHY SEEKING TO STRENGTHEN POLITICAL MAJORITIES.
946	SUBNATIONAL COMPARISON CAN HELP ANALYZE HOW NASCENT DEMOCRACIES CONSTRUCT THE RULE OF LAW. VARIATION IN JUDICIAL AUTONOMY ACROSS TWO NEIGHBORING ARGENTINE PROVINCES IS A FUNCTION OF INTERPARTY COMPETITION. THE RULE OF LAW RESULTS FROM A BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN AT LEAST TWO POLITICAL PARTIES, NEITHER OF WHICH HAS MONOLITHIC CONTROL; NO HIGHLY DISCIPLINED PARTY SUSTAINS CONTROL OF BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE BRANCHES. EFFECTIVE PARTY COMPETITION AND LOW PARTY DISCIPLINE CREATE A CLIMATE IN WHICH AN AUTONOMOUS JUDICIARY CAN DEVELOP. IN CONTRAST, MONOLITHIC PARTY CONTROL, DEFINED AS A PROLONGED PERIOD OF UNIFIED GOVERNMENT UNDER A DISCIPLINED PARTY, BLOCKS DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW.
947	HUNGARY'S AND POLAND'S ILLIBERAL DRIFT ENTAILS AN UNPRECEDENTED AND UNHEARD-OF CRISIS IN THE EUROPEAN CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. THE LACK OF FORESIGHT IN THE TREATIES CONCERNING A NORMATIVE MECHANISM FOR THE DEFENCE OF THE UNION'S FUNDAMENTAL VALUES SHOULD BE EMENDED WITH THE SOLUTIONS OFFERED BY GENERAL INTER-NATIONAL LAW.
948	THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PARTICULAR TYPES OF LEGAL INSTITUTIONS INFLUENCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW HAS LONG BEEN ANSWERED WITH CONJECTURE. COMMON LAW LAWYERS AND JUDGES TEND TO BELIEVE THAT THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM IS SUPERIOR. THIS OPINION IS BASED ON THE IDEA THAT THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM INHERITED FROM THE BRITISH IS MORE ABLE TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAN CIVIL LAW JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. QUITE THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW CAN BE FOUND IN LAWYERS FROM CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES, WHO MAY VIEW THE COMMON LAW SYSTEM AS CAPRICIOUS AND DISORGANISED. THIS PAPER COMPARES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW IN COMMON LAW AND CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, THROUGH A CROSS-NATIONAL STATISTICAL COMPARISON USING FREEDOM HOUSE AND POLITICAL RISK SERVICES DATA. THE COMPARISON REVEALS THAT COMMON LAW COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT PROVIDING 'RULE OF LAW' THAN ARE CIVIL LAW COUNTRIES.
949	JUDICIAL REFORM AND PROMOTION OF THE RULE OF LAW ARE AT THE VERY TOP OF THE POLITICAL AGENDAS OF MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. MOREOVER, IN THE CONTEXT OF DEMOCRATIZATION AND A GROWING CONCERN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND CITIZENSHIP, MANY SOCIAL GROUPS ARE PREPARED TO USE THE LAW AS A MEANS TO CHALLENGE THE STATE. THIS ARTICLE LOOKS AT HOW A GROUP IN MEXICO USED THE LAW TO RESIST THE STATE'S ATTEMPT TO EXPROPRIATE LAND FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT. THE LAW WAS USED AS A METHOD OF OPPOSITION AS WELL AS A SYMBOL, BY ALLOWING THE RESISTANCE TO BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF 'RIGHTS'. IN SO DOING, THE LEGAL DISCOURSE EXPOSED DEEPER CONCERNS FOR JUSTICE, ETHNICITY AND NATIONHOOD. THE SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT, HOWEVER, IS SHOWN TO BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO EITHER THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WHICH STRUCTURED THE RESISTANCE OR THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THE CONFRONTATION SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH.
950	THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC) CONSTITUTE TWO PROMINENT INTERNATIONAL COURTS. HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN STATES' SUPPORT FOR THESE TWO INSTITUTIONS. THE ROME STATUTE, WHICH RECOGNIZES THE JURISDICTION OF THE ICC HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY OVER HALF THE STATES IN THE WORLD; ONLY A THIRD OF STATES ACCEPT THE COMPULSORY JURISDICTION OF THE ICJ. HOW ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THIS VARIATION IN STATE SUPPORT FOR THESE TWO COURTS? I ARGUE THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT LINK BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF A STATE'S DOMESTIC LEGAL SYSTEM (RULE OF LAW) AND PERCEIVED LEGITIMACY OF AN INTERNATIONAL COURT. EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF STATES' SUPPORT FOR THE ICJ AND THE ICC SHOW THAT RULE-OF-LAW STATES LEND SUPPORT TO THE ICC, A COURT PERCEIVED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AS LEGITIMATE. ALLEGED BIAS OF THE ICJ HAS, ON THE OTHER HAND, SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKENED SUPPORT FOR THIS COURT AMONG RULE-OF-LAW STATES.
951	THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW CRISIS ON A CORE AREA OF EU LAW: COMPETITION LAW. IT ANALYSES THE REFORMS OF THE JUDICIARY IN SELECTED EU MEMBER STATES AND THE REACTION OF EU INSTITUTIONS. THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT THE REFORMS OF THE JUDICIARY GIVE RISE TO DOUBTS REGARDING THE INDEPENDENCE AND EXPERTISE OF COURTS WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE DECISIONS OF NATIONAL COMPETITION AUTHORITIES ADOPTED UNDER ARTICLES 101-102 TREATY ON THE FUNCTIONING OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (TFEU) AND NATIONAL COMPETITION LAWS. AS A RESULT, THE EFFECTIVE JUDICIAL PROTECTION REQUIRED BY EU PRIMARY LAW IS UNDERMINED. IN ADDITION, MUTUAL TRUST, UPON WHICH THE DECENTRALIZED ENFORCEMENT OF EU COMPETITION LAW IS BASED, IS PUT INTO QUESTION. THE ARTICLE CALLS UPON ELI INSTITUTIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, TO MONITOR CLOSELY THE DEVELOPMENTS IN MEMBER STATES WHICH MAY AFFECT THE ENFORCEMENT OF EU (AND NATIONAL) COMPETITION RULES.
952	ARTICLE 1 OF THE UKRAINIAN CONSTITUTION DEFINES THE COUNTRY AS A STATE FOUNDED ON RULE OF LAW. WHETHER THIS CORRESPONDS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL REALITY HAS TO BE MEASURED AGAINST INTERNATIONAL CRITERIA. BY THIS STANDARD, CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN SOME FIELDS HAS IN FACT BEEN ACHIEVED. UKRAINE HAS AT ITS DISPOSAL A MODERN SYSTEM OF BASIC LEGAL GUARANTEES. IT HAS ALSO INTRODUCED A SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS. BUT THE POLITICAL POWER STRUGGLES RETARD THE CONSOLIDATION OF RULE OF LAW.
953	SCHOLARS ARE INCREASINGLY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING WAYS TO STRENGTHEN THE RULE OF LAW IN AUTHORITARIAN STATESESPECIALLY WHEN DEEPER POLITICAL REFORMS ARE NOT ATTAINABLE. THE ARTICLE CONTRIBUTES TO THIS DISCUSSION BY REVISITING THE STORY OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE SO-CALLED SOCIALIST LEGALITY IN THE COMMUNIST STATES OF EASTERN EUROPE. USING THE HISTORICAL RECORD FROM POLAND, THE AUTHOR DEMONSTRATES A PREVIOUSLY UNNOTICED, YET PIVOTAL, ROLE OF LEGAL PROFESSIONALS IN FACILITATING SOCIALIST LEGALITY'S RISE TO PROMINENCE. USING THE LENSES OF PIERRE BOURDIEU'S THEORY OF FIELDS, THE ARTICLE CHRONICLES THE EVOLVING DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE LEGAL PROFESSION, THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME, AND SOCIETY. THESE OBSERVATIONS CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE EMERGENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN NONDEMOCRATIC CONDITIONS.
954	THE AUTHOR ANALYZES EU'S RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING ECONOMIC CRISIS, FOCUSING ON THE PROBLEM OF LEGISLATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAGMENTATION. SHE ARGUES THAT THE AUTHORITARIAN CRISIS MANAGEMENT - FUELED BY "CRISIS" DISCOURSE SUBVERTED DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY BY ITS RELIANCE ON EXECUTIVE DISCRETION AND INTERGOVERNMENTALISM. THROUGH AN ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE'S CASE LAW AS WELL AS A CLOSE LOOK AT THE EXACT WORKINGS AND IMPLICATIONS OF EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK'S ULTRA VIRES ACTIONS, SHE SHOWS HOW LISBON TREATY WAS SACRIFICED TO THE EXIGENCY OF CREATING AN ERSATZ UNION LAW MORE PLIABLE TO THE IMMEDIATE CONCERNS OF REFORMING THE EMU. SHE HOLDS THAT THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL INSTRUMENTS NOT ONLY "UNCONSTITUTIONALLY" REQUISITIONED THE INVOLVEMENT OF EU INSTITUTIONS, BUT ALSO ESTABLISHED A POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION UNRESPONSIVE TO DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY, DAMAGING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE UNION. THE RESULTING SUBJUGATION OF THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONSTITUTION TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THREATENS AN ABDICATION OF LAW AND UNDERMINES THE INTEGRITY OF THE UNION LEGAL ORDER.
955	DESPITE FORMAL ADHESION BY COUNTRIES IN THE SAHEL TO REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS PROMOTING GOVERNANCE, HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW, WEAK STATE INSTITUTIONS, POOR HUMAN RIGHTS TRACK-RECORDS, AS WELL AS POOR GOVERNANCE AND CORRUPTION REMAIN WIDESPREAD AND HAVE BUILT UP TO ERUPT IN THE POLITICAL AND SECURITY CRISIS THAT UNFOLDED IN MALI. STRENGTHENING HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW BY RENEWING THE COMMITMENT MADE BY COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO DEMOCRATIC, GOVERNANCE AND HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORKS, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING SUSTAINABLE PEACE BACK TO MALI WHILE PREVENTING ESCALATION IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES. BEYOND THE COMPLETE RATIFICATION AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS, EFFORTS MUST BE PURSUED TO IMPROVE DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES; STRENGTHEN INEFFECTIVE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS; AND SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS MONITORING MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED AT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS. MOREOVER, COMPREHENSIVE TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE PROCESSES MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IN COUNTRIES EMERGING FROM CRISIS, WITH A VIEW TO ADDRESSING PAST HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.
956	THE SCHOLARSHIP ON EUROPEAN UNION EXTERNAL RELATIONS TIES GOOD PERFORMANCE TO ENHANCED COHERENCE ACROSS EU POLICIES, OFTEN UNDERSTOOD AS UNIFORMITY, AND INTERPRETS ANY SIGN OF VARIATION AS INCOHERENCE AND DOUBLE STANDARDS. THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THE VIRTUOUSNESS OF SUCH UNIFORMITY IN THE CASE OF EU RULE OF LAW PROMOTION IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND EXAMINES THE PARAMETERS OF THE POSSIBLE AND THE NECESSARY. THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT VARIATION IN EU RULE OF LAW CONCEPTIONS IS INHERENT TO THE EU APPROACH AND INEVITABLE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE RULE OF LAW CONCEPT AND THE STUDIED POLITICAL CONTEXT. MOREOVER, THIS VARIATION IN ITSELF DOES NOT ENTAIL INCOHERENCE OF EU RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, AS A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE MEANING OF THE RULE OF LAW FRAMES EU EFFORTS ACROSS CASES, AND IS EVEN DESIRABLE FOR EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW PROMOTION, UNDER LAW AND DEVELOPMENT THEORY AND PRACTICE.
957	GLOBAL TRADE DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF FIRMS TO MAKE CREDIBLE COMMITMENTS ACROSS BORDERS. ABSENT A GLOBAL STATE TO ENFORCE CONTRACTS, HOW CAN CREDIBILITY BE ASSURED? TODAY, THE MAJORITY OF SIGNIFICANT TRANSBORDER CONTRACT DISPUTES ARE ADJUDICATED IN PRIVATE ARBITRAL TRIBUNALS. THE DECISIONS OF THESE BODIES ARE ENFORCEABLE IN THE PUBLIC COURTS OF THE 146 COUNTRIES THAT HAVE RATIFIED THE 1958 NEW YORK CONVENTION ON THE RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARDS, MAKING IT A CENTRAL PILLAR OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THIS ARTICLE EVALUATES ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS WIDESPREAD DELEGATION TO PRIVATE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY VIA SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OF RATIFICATION FROM 1958 TO THE PRESENT. UNLIKE THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION, PREFERENTIAL TRADE AGREEMENTS, OR BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATIES, THE TRANSNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION REGIME HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DIFFUSION OF LEGAL NORMS THROUGH A TRANSNATIONAL NETWORK OF EXPERTS.
958	FROM THE NINETEENTH CENTURY ONWARD, LAWYERS HAVE BEEN THE LEADING MEMBERS OF LATIN AMERICAN POLITICAL ELITES. NEVERTHELESS, LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH CAUDILLOS AND DICTATORS, AND LAWYERS HAVE BEEN THESE STRONGMEN'S COLLABORATORS. THE ARTICLE EXPLAINS THE DISSONANCE BETWEEN THE CONSTITUTIONALISM AND LEGALISM TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITIES AND THE SORDID POLITICAL PRACTICES THAT RESULTED FROM THE LACK OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION: THERE WAS NOT A MARKET FOR LAWYERS' SERVICES, SO LAWYERS DEPENDED ON THOSE WHO CONTROLLED THE POLITICAL APPARATUS. THE SITUATION STARTED CHANGING IN THE LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY. DURING THIS RECENT PERIOD, LAWYERS AND JUDGES HAVE SHOWN MORE INDEPENDENCE AND HAVE BECOME ACTIVE POLITICAL PLAYERS, USING THE LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR OPPOSING ARBITRARY POLITICAL PRACTICES. THE NEW TREND IS EXPLAINED NOT ONLY BY THE INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE RULE OF LAW VALUES BUT ALSO BY THE EXISTENCE OF A MARKET FOR LEGAL SERVICES.
959	INTRODUCTION: POLITICALLY MOTIVATED VIOLENCE AROUND ELECTIONS IN ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED BEFORE. A FACT-FINDING MISSION WAS PLANNED AND UNDERTAKEN TWO MONTHS AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION MARCH 2002. METHODOLOGY: WE INTERVIEWED AND EXAMINED PERSONS WHO ALLEGED EXPOSURE TO POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TORTURE, ILL TREATMENT AND OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. WE ASSESSED THE VALIDITY OF INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS OF TORTURE AND ILL TREATMENT AND ASSESSED EXISTING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HISTORIES OF INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWEES, EG, AS TO TIMING OF THE ASSAULT AND USE OF TORTURE INSTRUMENTS TO FURTHER APPRAISE THE VALIDITY. WE ANALYSED THE RESULTS OF OUR FINDINGS IN RELATION TO A NEWLY INTRODUCED LAW RESTRICTING CIVIL RIGHTS, AND TO THE EXPERIENCES OF DISRESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE. RESULTS: FOUR MEN GAVE ACCOUNTS OF BEING BEATEN SYSTEMATICALLY WITH BARBED WIRE AND ELECTRICAL CABLE ALL OVER THEIR BODIES. THE CLINICAL FINDINGS WERE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT HEREWITH AND THEIR HISTORIES WERE MUTUALLY CONSISTENT. IN TEN ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS, WE COLLECTED EVIDENCE OF KILLING, ILL TREATMENT AND HARASSMENT INCLUDING ROBBING OF ID CARDS FROM TORTURE VICTIMS. APART FROM LOSING THEIR VOTE IN THE FORTHCOMING ELECTION, ACCORDING TO THE NEW LAW, VICTIMS WITH STOLEN ID CARDS WILL BE LIABLE TO UP TO SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT. ACCORDING TO PRECEDENTS, PERPETRATORS OF ELECTION VIOLENCE AND TORTURE CAN EXPECT IMPUNITY. THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NEW LAW UNDERMINES DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS AND FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND FACILITATES ELECTION VIOLENCE INCLUDING TORTURE. WE RECEIVED STATEMENTS ABOUT INTERFERENCE BY THE POLICE IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN HOSPITALS AND THE NEW LAW COULD IMPEDE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN DOCUMENTING AND REPORTING CRIMES INCLUDING TORTURE. CONCLUSION: THE RULE OF LAW, THE LAW POINTS TO THE DEEPEST DISRESPECT FOR DEMOCRATIC AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN ZIMBABWE. OUR FINDINGS FIT INTO THIS PATTERN. ANY ELECTION UNDER THESE CONDITIONS CANNOT BE FREE AND FAIR. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE HINDERED IN EXERCISING THEIR DUTIES BOTH IN TERMS OF OFFERING SERVICES AND IN TERMS OF DOCUMENTATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD MONITOR THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE AND STRENGTHEN THE SANCTIONS IF TORTURE SYSTEMATICALLY IS USED AGAINST OPPONENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OR IF THE FOOD AID IS PROVIDED SELECTIVELY TO SUPPORTERS OF THE GOVERNMENT.
960	THE BOURGEOIS VISION OF THE OFFENSE ADHERES STRICTLY TO COMMONVIOLENT ACT COMMITTED BY ONE OR MORE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST PROPERTY OR PHYSICAL INTEGRITY OF OTHERS AND THEIR SOLUTION IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE, WHO MUST USE VIOLENCE TO CONTROL OR ERADICATE LEGAL, LEAVING THE COMMUNITY AT THE MERCY OF POLICE ACTION JUDICIAL AND IMPLEMENTED FOR THIS PURPOSE. CRIME IS NOT AN ANOMALY, IS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PATTERN OF EXPLOITATION AND EXPROPRIATION OF CAPITALIST SOCIETY, WHICH PROMOTES A SAVAGE CAPITALISM. THE ORIGIN OF THE CRIME IS STRUCTURAL; IT IS INHERENT TO THE TYPEPROPERTY RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE THAT EXIST WITHIN IT. THE REPRODUCTION OF CAPITALISM HAS NOT ONLY PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF GOODS, AS WELL AS REPRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE ARE FORCED TO SELL TO THE CAPITALIST (AND THIS IS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE SYSTEM) BUT AS NOT ALL MANAGE TO ENTER THE PRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, AS THIS IS UNABLE TO ABSORB THEM INTO THEIR - ALL, IT CAUSES A "MASS" OF THE DISPOSSESSED (RESERVE ARMY MARX CALLED THEM) WHO CANNOT ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE ITS EXISTENCE, THIS "MASS" DEPRIVED OF ALL MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE IS DRIVEN TO SATISFY THEIR BASIC NEEDS INSTINCTIVELY AND IMMEDIATE AND ARE NOT PRESENTED CHOICES BETWEEN RIGHT OR WRONG, DESIRABLE OR NOT IS NOW AN URGENT MATTER OF SURVIVAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE MARGINALIZED, THE EXECRATED THE ENJOYMENT OF THE WEALTH PRODUCED PRIVATE PROPERTY, FORCING THE "MASS " TO COMMIT CRIMES.
961	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES HOW AUTHORITARIAN CONTENDERS USE LAW TO ADVANCE AN AGENDA GEARED TO EXCLUSIVE STATE POWER IN LIGHT OF A PARADIGMATIC CASE: THE NATIONAL SOCIALISTS' TAKEOVER OF THE GERMAN STATE APPARATUS IN SPRING 1933. THIS CASE HIGHLIGHTS TWO WAYS IN WHICH AN OFFICE HOLDER IS ABLE TO EXPAND HIS POWER IN AN AUTHORITARIAN FASHION THROUGH LEGAL DISPOSITIONS. ACONJUNCTURALUSE OF LAW FOR AUTHORITARIAN PURPOSES DRAWS ON LEGAL STATUTES TO UNDERCUT THE POLITICAL CAPACITY OF OPPONENTS AND COMPETITORS, HOLLOW OUT INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS, AND CRUCIALLY HAMPER CIVIL FREEDOMS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS THAT MAKE INSTITUTIONAL SUBVERSION FROM WITHIN POSSIBLE ('CONSTITUTIONAL TROJAN HORSES'), ASTRUCTURALUSE OF LEGAL STATUTES REORDERS THE POWER STRUCTURE BY REALLOCATING DECISIONAL RIGHTS. IN BOTH CASES, LAW SERVES AS A WEAPON AGAINST THE RULE OF LAW. THESE CONSIDERATIONS RAISE THE QUESTION OF THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WE ARE TO JUDGE THE LEGALITY OF SUCH ACTS. CONTEMPORARY INSTANCES OF DEMOCRATIC BACKSLIDING ARE CASES IN POINT.
962	SOCIAL-MEDIA COMPANIES MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO REMOVE AND BLOCK TERRORIST CONTENT FROM THEIR PLATFORMS. THIS PAPER BEGINS BY ARGUING THAT, SINCE SUCH EFFORTS AMOUNT TO AN ATTEMPT TO CHANNEL HUMAN CONDUCT, THEY SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A FORM OF REGULATION THAT IS SUBJECT TO RULE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES. THE PAPER THEN DISCUSSES THREE SETS OF RULE-OF-LAW ISSUES. THE FIRST SET CONCERNS ENFORCEABILITY. HERE, THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE DISPLACEMENT EFFECTS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM THE AUTOMATED REMOVAL AND BLOCKING OF TERRORIST CONTENT AND ARGUES THAT REGARD MUST BE HAD TO THE WHOLE SOCIAL-MEDIA ECOLOGY, AS WELL AS TO JIHADIST GROUPS OTHER THAN THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC STATE AND OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM. SINCE RULE BY LAW IS ONLY A NECESSARY, AND NOT A SUFFICIENT, CONDITION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH RULE-OF-LAW VALUES, THE PAPER THEN GOES ON TO EXAMINE TWO FURTHER SETS OF ISSUES: THE CLARITY WITH WHICH SOCIAL-MEDIA COMPANIES DEFINE TERRORIST CONTENT AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH A USER MAY APPEAL AGAINST AN ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR THE BLOCKING OR REMOVAL OF CONTENT. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY IDENTIFYING A RANGE OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT EMERGE FROM THE DISCUSSION AND THAT TOGETHER FORM A PROMISING AND TIMELY RESEARCH AGENDA TO WHICH LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE.
963	RESEARCH SURROUNDING POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS AND CREDIBLE COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW IS INTEGRAL TO RECENT EFFORTS TO TIE DEMOCRACY TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I IDENTIFY THE DETERMINANTS OF RULE-OF-LAW PERCEPTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND ARGUE THAT CONSTRAINING ELECTED OFFICIALS FACILITATES A COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY THAT MAKES GOVERNMENT POLICIES CREDIBLE. I ALSO ARGUE THAT ASPECTS OF POLITICS LEADING TO DEADLOCK MIGHT HAVE A HIDDEN UPSIDE IN GENERATING POLICY CREDIBILITY. I TEST MY ARGUMENTS AGAINST POOLED CROSS-SECTIONAL, TIME SERIES DATA FOR TWENTY LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES BETWEEN 1996 AND 2012. ULTIMATELY, MY RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE BENEFITS OF FUNCTIONING CHECKS AND BALANCES AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND PROVIDES A UNIFORM FRAMEWORK LINKING DEMOCRATIC INPUTS TO LEGAL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES.
964	THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS MADE COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA A CRUCIAL CONDITION TO FURTHERING RELATIONS WITH SERBIA. THIS APPROACH, KNOWN AS "ICTY CONDITIONALITY", STEMS FROM THE CONVICTION THAT THE TRIBUNAL IS A KEY FACTOR IN REBUILDING THE RULE OF LAW IN THE WESTERN BALKANS. IN CONTRAST TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON EU CONDITIONALITY IN GENERAL OR ON ICTY CONDITIONALITY IN SPECIFIC, THIS ARTICLE EMPHASIZES THE RELEVANCE OF ALL INVOLVED ACTORS: IT EXAMINES THE INTERACTION OF ICTY CONDITIONALITY, DOMESTIC FACTORS AND THE ICTY'S JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE INFLUENCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW IN SERBIA. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT THE GOAL OF USING THE ICTY AS A TOOL TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW IN SERBIA HAS FAILED DUE TO A LACK OF NORM DIFFUSION, ALTHOUGH ALL ICTY CONDITIONALITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE EVENTUALLY FORMALLY BEEN FULFILLED. THIS WAS NOT ONLY DUE TO INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF ICTY CONDITIONALITY ON THE EU'S SIDE, BUT ALSO ON ACCOUNT OF DEFICIENCIES IN THE LEGAL OPERATION OF THE TRIBUNAL. LASTLY, NEITHER THE EU'S DEMANDS NOR THE ICTY'S WORK FELL ON FRUITFUL DOMESTIC GROUNDS.
965	THE STRENGTHENING OF RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNISED AS A KEY COMPONENT TO CONSOLIDATING PEACE IN POST-CONFLICT SITUATIONS. ENSURING FAIRNESS UNDER THE LAW (AND THE APPEARANCE OF FAIRNESS) WHILST EXPANDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN RURAL AREAS HAS BECOME A CHIEF PLANK IN PEACEBUILDING EFFORTS IN SIERRA LEONE FOLLOWING A DECADE-LONG CIVIL CONFLICT BORN OF CORRUPT MISMANAGEMENT IN THIS FAILED POST-COLONIAL STATE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER FOR JUSTICE INSTITUTIONS TO BE MEANINGFUL, LOCAL PRACTICES MUST BE ENGAGED. DESPITE DISCOURSE SUGGESTING THAT JUSTICE IS 'UNIVERSAL', SOCIO-LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT JUSTICE AND ITS PERFORMANCE ARE CULTURAL ARTEFACTS. ANY ROBUST PEACE IN SIERRA LEONE MUST TWIN INCREASINGLY GLOBALISED RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS WITH LOCAL MEANINGS AND PRACTICES OF JUSTICE. AT THE SAME TIME, LOCAL JUSTICE PRACTICES MUST BE ARTICULATED WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. MOREOVER, THE POST-CONFLICT PERIOD OPENS A UNIQUE SPACE TO EXPAND SIERRA LEONEAN LOCAL JUSTICE PRACTICES TO STAY THE HAND OF VENGEANCE FOLLOWING AN INTER-COMMUNAL WAR WHERE REGULAR PEOPLE BECAME PERPETRATORS, AND ALMOST EVERYONE BECAME A VICTIM. DRAWING ON FIELDWORK CONDUCTED IN SIERRA LEONE, THIS ARTICLE WILL EXAMINE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RULE OF LAW INSTITUTIONS IN SIERRA LEONEAN PEACEBUILDING AND ATTEMPT TO SUGGEST HOW THESE INSTITUTIONS MIGHT COEXIST WITH LOCAL, 'TRADITIONAL' JUSTICE PRACTICES. MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE ALSO OFFERS A CRITIQUE OF RULE OF LAW PROGRAMMING, DRAWING ANALOGIES TO THE CRITICISMS MOUNTED AGAINST THE LAW AND DEVELOPMENT MOVEMENT.
966	THE RULE OF LAW AS A FOUNDATIONAL VALUE OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED IN THE MEMBER STATES, ALONG THE PRESUMPTION THAT "ONCE A DEMOCRACY, ALWAYS A DEMOCRACY". THIS OPTIMISTIC PRESUMPTION PROVED TO BE WRONG, WHEN IN THE 2010S A TOP-DOWN AND SYSTEMIC DECLINE IN THE RULE OF LAW STARTED, FIRST IN HUNGARY, THEN IN POLAND. EVEN THOUGH EU ACTION AGAINST RULE OF LAW BACKSLIDING IN THE MEMBER STATES IS OF EXISTENTIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE WHOLE EUROPEAN PROJECT, EU INSTITUTIONS SEEM TO BE EITHER SILENT OR TOO SLOW AND INEFFICIENT WHEN TACKLING THE PROBLEM. IN THIS PAPER WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EU, WHICH WAS EMPHASIZING VIOLATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND WE ARGUE THAT ADHERENCE TO A FORMAL UNDERSTANDING OR AT THE MINIMUM INCORPORATING ARGUMENTS RELATED TO A FORMAL CONCEPT OF THE RULE OF LAW WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL BOTH IN TERMS OF SPEED AND DESIRED EFFECT. TAKING HUNGARY AS AN EXAMPLE WE SHOW THAT THE LACK OF PRELIMINARY CONSULTATIONS AND IMPACT ASSESSMENTS DURING LAWMAKING, THE ENACTMENT OF SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE REFORMS IN ACCELERATED PROCEDURES WITHOUT ANY ADEQUATE JUSTIFICATION, THE ADOPTION OF AD HOMINEM LAWS, OR THE UNCLARITY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF LEGISLATION ARE ALL MANIFEST VIOLATIONS OF THE FORMAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE OF LAW. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL IN THIS APPROACH THAT WE BELIEVE THE EU INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT EXPLOITED FULLY.
967	WE DEVELOP A MODEL OF THE INTERACTIONS AMONG DECENTRALIZATION, INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE RULE OF LAW. THE MODEL SHEDS LIGHT ON THE AMBIGUOUS EMPIRICAL RESULTS REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE GROWTH EFFECTS OF THE POLICY OF DEVOLVING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE FIND THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF CIVICNESS WITHIN A COUNTRY DETERMINES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECTS OF DECENTRALIZATION ON ITS REGIONAL CONVERGENCE, AS WELL AS WHETHER DECENTRALIZATION FOSTERS OR DAMPENS THE COUNTRY'S NATIONAL GROWTH. WE PERFORM A SERIES OF SIMULATED "REFORMS" USING MONTE CARLO METHODS PARAMETERIZED USING OECD COUNTRIES DATA SET. WE THEN TEST OUR FINDINGS USING A PANEL DATA SET OF 23 OECD COUNTRIES COVERING THE PERIOD 1975-2010. WE FIND THAT THE SHORT AND THE LONG RUN GROWTH EFFECT OF DECENTRALIZATION POLICY DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE POLICY REFORM AND CAN RANGE FROM EXTREMELY NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE DEPENDING ON THE RULE OF LAW, THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL CAPITAL AND ITS REGIONAL DISPERSION, IN LINE WITH THE MODEL PREDICTIONS.

968	ENTRY INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A STRATEGIC ACT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK AN OPTIMAL WAY TO EXPLOIT THEIR HUMAN, SOCIAL, AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL. TRADE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CHOICE ARE INFLUENCED BY INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS. WE USE SIGNALLING THEORY, EMPLOYMENT CHOICE THEORY, AND THEORY ON STRATEGIC ENTRY TO DEVELOP HYPOTHESES ON THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS REGULATIONS AND RULE OF LAW ON STRATEGIC AND NON-STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY. ANALYSING A SIX-YEAR PANEL OF 54 COUNTRIES, WE FIND LIGHTER BURDEN OF REGULATION ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER RATE AND RELATIVE PREVALENCE OF STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURIAL ENTRY. RULE OF LAW MODERATES THIS EFFECT SUCH THAT REGULATION HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON STRATEGIC ENTRY ONLY WHEN RULE OF LAW IS STRONG. THESE FINDINGS ARE ROBUST AGAINST ALTERNATIVE PROXIES. IMPLICATIONS ARE DRAWN FOR PROSPECTIVE ENTREPRENEURS, EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS, POLICY, AND FURTHER RESEARCH.
969	AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL JUDICIARY IS FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT OF RULE OF LAW. IN THIS REGARD, JAPANESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN PROBLEMATIC AND CRITICIZED AS "HOPELESS". THE CONVICTION RATE IN JAPAN IS OVER 99%, AND THE STATISTICS CASTS SERIOUS DOUBT OF IMPARTIALITY OF THE COURT, AS WELL AS SHOW THE PROBLEM OF JUSTICE, IN TERMS OF DEFENDANTS' HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THE 'PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE'. INDEED, SERIOUS STRUCTURAL PROBLEM IN JAPANESE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CAUSES NUMEROUS HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE IN THE CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS AND SERIOUS WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AGAINST INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS. IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL CRITICISMS TOWARD THE JAPANESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT COMMENCED A COMPREHENSIVE JUDICIAL REFORM IN 2000. AS ONE OF THE REFORM PROJECTS, A BILL WAS ENACTED IN 2004 TO INTRODUCE A QUASI-JURY SYSTEM (THE SO-CALLED 'SAIBANIN SYSTEM') AND TO REVISE THE CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. THIS NEW SYSTEM HAS COME INTO FORCE IN 2009. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE END OF THE WORLD WAR II 60 YEARS AGO FOR JAPAN TO REALIZE A SYSTEM OF CITIZENS' PARTICIPATION IN THE COURT SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THIS NEW SYSTEM HAS SEVERAL PROGRESSIVE ASPECTS, IT CANNOT BE EVALUATED AS A VICTORY IN TERMS OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND THE PREVENTION OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF THE REFORM AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT IMPACTS, AS WELL AS REMAINED AGENDA FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM IN JAPAN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF RULE OF LAW.
970	ALTHOUGH AUTHORITARIAN RULE OF LAW MAY SEEM AN OXYMORON, STRATEGIC RECONFIGURATIONS OF THE RULE OF LAW CAN PRODUCE ACCEPTANCE OF LAW THAT OBSERVES PROCEDURE WHILE ERASING RIGHTS. BY BRINGING INTO CONJUNCTION CRITICAL DISCOURSE THEORY AND SCHOLARSHIP ON THE LEGAL PROFESSIONS AND POLITICAL LIBERALISM, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS HOW RULERS CAN DEPLOY RHETORIC AND LEGISLATION TO PRODUCE DEROGATIONS FROM THE LIBERAL CONTENT OF RULE OF LAW WHILE SUSTAINING A STATE LEGITIMACY BUILT ON CLAIMS TO STATE REALIZATIONS OF RULE OF LAW. A CLOSE ANALYSIS OF SINGAPORE'S VANDALISM ACT SHOWS THAT SILENCING THE CRITIQUE OF LAWYERS AND CONSTRAINING THE POWER OF JUDGES HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO A LEGITIMATION OF THE SURVEILLANCE AND CRIMINALIZATION OF DISSENTERS. THE CONSOLIDATION OF STATE POWER EFFECTED VIA LAW AND DISCOURSE MIGHT BE SEEN AS MAKING THE NATION A NOTIONAL PANOPTICONCORPORAL PUNISHMENT, EVEN IF CONDUCTED BEHIND PRISON WALLS, BECOMES INSTRUCTIVE PUBLIC SPECTACLE CONVEYING THE STATE'S SEEMING OMNISCIENCE AND MONOPOLISTIC COMMAND OF LAW.
971	THIS CONTRIBUTION INTENDS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW, PARTICULARLY BY QUESTIONING THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH RULE OF LAW IN EARLY MODERN AMSTERDAM. IN LITERATURE, THINNER AND THICKER DEFINITIONS ARE GIVEN, MOSTLY PRESENTED AS A CONTINUUM. THIS CONTRIBUTION WILL FOCUS ON MERCANTILE CUSTOMARY LAW AS IT IS A LEGAL SOURCE THAT HARDLY FITS IN THE LITERATURE-BASED CATEGORIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF CUSTOMARY LAW SEEMS TO HAVE DECREASED PARALLEL WITH THE BUREAUCRATIZATION OF LAW; SIMILARLY THIS LEGAL SOURCE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS RELATIVELY DEMOCRATIC AS IT WAS BASED ON THE CONSENT OF A CERTAIN COMMUNITY. THIS AMBIGUITY WAS ALSO PART OF AN OLD DEBATE AMONG LEGAL HISTORIANS. SOME HAVE INDEED ARGUED THAT CUSTOM WAS INDEED SOLELY BASED ON THE TACIT CONSENT OF COMMUNITIES WHILE OTHERS CLAIMED THAT CUSTOM WAS A LEGALISTIC SOURCE IN THE SENSE THAT IT PROVIDED FORMAL RULES OF DECISION OFTEN WRITTEN DOWN IN A WAY VERY SIMILAR TO LAW BOOKS. THIS DEBATE RUNS PARALLEL TO THE QUESTION TO WHAT EXTEND MERCHANTS MADE USE OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE ORGANISATION OF THEIR TRADES.WITH REGARD TO EARLY MODERN AMSTERDAM, THIS CONTRIBUTION ARGUES ON THE BASIS OF A VARIETY OF PRIMARY SOURCES THAT LAWYERS AND PROCTORS HAD A RELATIVELY ADVANCED LEGAL SYSTEM AT THEIR DISPOSAL IN WHICH MORAL CONVICTIONS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE EXAMPLE OF THE CITY'S WEIGH HOUSE WILL BE USED TO ELABORATE ON THE PRECISE WAY THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS WERE APPLIED IN MERCANTILE PRACTICE. IT WILL BE CONCLUDED THAT MANY MERCANTILE CUSTOMARY NORMS CAN BE LINKED TO INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE WEIGH HOUSE, BUT THAT THIS INSTITUTIONALISATION WAS NOT NECESSARILY AT ODDS WITH A CONTINUATION OR EVEN DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC ELEMENTS. ESPECIALLY THE GUILDS FUNCTIONED AS A VEHICLE THAT HELPED TO ARTICULATE TACIT CUSTOMS WHILE HAVING A GREAT INFLUENCE ON AMSTERDAM POLITICS AT THE SAME TIME. FOR THIS REASON IT SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED THAT AMSTERDAM ALREADY HAD A RELATIVELY ADVANCED LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WAS DEPENDENT ON BUREAUCRATIC INSTITUTIONS IN THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD. SUCH SYSTEM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS THE PRESENCE OF THE RULE OF LAW.
972	THE RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM HAVE BECOME CENTRAL TO PEACEBUILDING INITIATIVES IN THE PAST DECADE AND A HALF, ACCOMPANYING A SURGE IN INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE PERIPHERY. CONSIDERED OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ORDER AND THE PROMOTION OF PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT, THESE TWO AREAS OF REFORM HAVE GAINED IMPORTANCE AND, TODAY, FEATURE AS PRIORITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION'S EXTERNAL ACTION BEYOND ITS IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD. SUCH POLICIES, HOWEVER, HAVE OFTEN FAILED TO ACHIEVE THEIR STATED GOALS. AFTER REVIEWING THE THEORETICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PEACEBUILDING, RULE OF LAW REFORM AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM, THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON THE UNION'S PRACTICE TO ARGUE THAT A NARROW, FORMALISTIC APPROACH TO RULE OF LAW AND SECURITY SECTOR REFORM, ONE THAT PRIORITISES THE TRANSPLANTATION OF A WESTERN LIBERAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK, HAS UNDERMINED THE AIMS OF CURBING INSTABILITY AND FOSTERING DEVELOPMENT.
973	IN THIS 2007 STATEMENT, THE CHINESE REPRESENTATIVE PUTS FORWARD CHINA'S VIEWS ON THE TOPIC OF THE RULE OF LAW.
974	AS THE POST-2015 DEVELOPMENT AGENDA IS SET TO REPLACE THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS ("MDGS"), ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL NEW ELEMENTS OF THE NEW AGENDA IS THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE ALL OF THE OFFICIAL FORA FOR DISCUSSING AND PRODUCING RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RULE OF LAW (OR SOME VARIATION) SHOULD BE INCLUDED, THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO ITS INCORPORATION IN THE FINAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ("SDGS"). THE INTERRELATED POINTS OF CONTENTION HAVE INCLUDED WHETHER RULE OF LAW APPLIES AT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL, WHETHER IT ENCOMPASSES DOMESTIC GOVERNANCE, AND HOW THE CONCEPT SHOULD BE DEFINED AND MEASURED. GOING FORWARD, THERE ARE A FEW KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING WHETHER AND HOW THE RULE OF LAW WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF DEVELOPMENT GOALS: 1) THE COMPELLING FORCE OF TRADITIONAL VIEWS ON DEVELOPMENT IN DETERMINING MEMBER STATES' POSITIONS IN THE DEBATE; 2) THE CONTINUED IMPORTANCE OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY ("UNGA") RULE OF LAW DECLARATION; 3) THE CENTRALITY OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S OPEN WORKING GROUP ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS ("OWG"); AND 4) THE EASE OF MEASUREMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED INDICATORS. IF INCORPORATED INTO THE NEW AGENDA, A RULE OF LAW GOAL WILL LIKELY INCLUDE INDICATORS THAT ARE EASILY EVALUATED AND GENERATE LITTLE POLITICAL FRICTION, SUCH AS LEGAL IDENTITY.
975	THIS ARTICLE ADOPTS THE SECURITISATION THEORY TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG SECURITISATION, NON-REFOULEMENT, A PEREMPTORY NORM, AND THE RULE OF LAW IN KENYA. THE ARGUMENTS RAISED ARE THAT SOMALI REFUGEES AND REFUGEE CAMPS PREDOMINANTLY OCCUPIED BY SOMALIS ARE FALSELY, IN BLANKET FASHION, SOCIALLY CONSTRUCTED AS ABETTING TERRORISM HENCE EXISTENTIAL THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY SO THAT THE STATE CAN PRIORITISE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFOULEMENT, A NORM-VIOLATING COUNTERTERRORISM MEASURE. THE RIGHTS OF SOMALI REFUGEES AND RULE OF LAW HAVE BEEN VIOLATED IN THE CONTEXT OF LEGALITY AND LEGAL CERTAINTY, DISCRETIONARY POWERS, EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW AND NON-DISCRIMINATION. IT IS ONLY WITH REGARD TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT THE RIGHTS OF SOMALI REFUGEES HAVE BEEN PROTECTED UNDER BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. KENYA HAS, THEREFORE, DEROGATED FROM THE DOCTRINE OF NON-REFOULEMENT HENCE VIOLATING THE RULE OF LAW DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE CONCLUSION OFFERS WAYS OF MITIGATING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF SECURITISATION ON NON-REFOULEMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW.
976	THIS ARTICLE USES A DIACHRONIC STUDY OF ARGENTINA TO EXPLAIN HOW THE NASCENT DEMOCRACIES OF LATIN AMERICA BUILD THE RULE OF LAW. THE CHANGING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARGENTINA'S EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RULE OF LAW IS NOT A LINEAR PROCESS. THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS OF REGRESSION AWAY FROM, AS WELL AS PROGRESS TOWARDS, THE RULE OF LAW. THIS ARTICLE USES PARTY COMPETITION TO EXPLAIN ARGENTINA'S VARYING LEVELS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. THE RULE OF LAW RESULTS FROM A BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN AT LEAST TWO POLITICAL PARTIES, NEITHER OF WHICH HAS MONOLITHIC CONTROL, MEANING THAT NO HIGHLY DISCIPLINED PARTY SUSTAINS CONTROL OF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES. COMPETITIVE POLITICS CREATES A CLIMATE IN WHICH AN AUTONOMOUS JUDICIARY CAN EMERGE.
977	THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN HONG KONG AND ITS PROCESS OF AUTOCRATISATION UNDER THE CHINESE SOVEREIGN. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS THAT, IN COLONIAL AND POST-COLONIAL TIMES, HONG KONG'S LEGAL SYSTEM FOLLOWS THE GLOBAL TREND OF AUTOCRATIC LEGALISM THAT EMPOWERS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO USE LAWS AND COURTS TO ACHIEVE THE GOVERNMENT'S POLITICAL GOALS. WITH THE RECENT IMPOSITION OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY LAW, THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL SYSTEMS OF HONG KONG ARE FURTHER AUTOCRATISED BENEATH THE VEIL OF SECURITISATION, FACILITATING CHINA'S AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNANCE IN HONG KONG.
978	THE PRESENT RESEARCH IS BASED ON COMPARISON OF MODERN RUSSIAN EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE ON LAW STATE WITH THE POINTS OF VIEW OF GERMAN RESEARCHERS AND SCIENTISTS, LEGIST. THE RESEARCH PAPERS AND ARTICLES OF GERMAN LEGIST IN THE FIELD OF LAW STATE ARE REGARDED AS SPECIFIC IDEAL. THE PAPER ANALYSES THE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTATION THE THEORY OF LAW STATE IN PRACTICE. IT IS PROVED THAT THERE ARE 3 ASPECTS OF CONCEPT OF LAW STATE: IDEA - AIM; 2 - THEORY (WAY); 3 - PRACTICE (RESULT)/THE AUTHORS COME TO THE CONCLUSION, THAT THE LAW STATE THEORY BEGINS TO DEVELOP IN 1813. THE TERM "LAW STATE" WAS SUGGESTED BY GERMAN SCIENTIST CARL THEODOR WELCKER IN 1813. ALL PREVIOUS RESEARCHERS CANNOT BE REGARDED AS CREATORS OR DEVELOPERS OF LAW STATE THEORY. INFORMATION AND TECHNIQUE POSSIBILITIES OF MODERN SOCIETY GROWS. SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE HAS HUGE INFORMATION VOLUME. THE PAPER SUGGESTS THE WAYS TO STRUCTURE AND ANALYZE PRESENT INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE ON LAW STATE THEORY. THE CONCEPT OF LAW STATE THEORY IS DISPUTABLE. NOWADAYS SCIENCE HASN'T WORKED OUT SPECIFIC METHODS OF EXAMINATION OF LEGAL NATURE OF STATES. THAT IS WHY THE TERM "LAW STATE" USED BY THE CONSTITUTION OF RUSSIA IS ONLY INEXACT TRANSLATION OF GERMAN TERM.
979	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RESULTS FIRST AND FOREMOST IN A BIGGER OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES. WHETHER IT ALSO ENHANCES THE RULE OF LAW IS A CLASSICAL QUESTION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ECONOMICS. THE ABSOLUTELY REMARCABLE ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN EAST ASIA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA IN RECENT DECADES HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY THE RULE OF LAW IN ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES. ARE WE TO CONCLUDE THAT ECONOMIC PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE RULE OF LAW?
980	THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE EXERCISE OF CRITICISM AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN EVERY DEMOCRATIC ORDER HAS ATTRACTED GREATER INTEREST IN RECENT TIMES. THE PRESENT WORK PROPOSES TO ANALYZE THIS TOPIC FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF J. HABERMAS'S DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY, SHOWING SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES BUT ALSO THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES WITH CRITICAL THEORY. THE IDEA OF THIS STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF THE CONCEPTUAL HERITAGE OF THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL IN HABERMAS'S DELIBERATIVE POLITICS, A CONNECTION THAT IN THIS THEORY IS ALWAYS ONLY IMPLICIT BUT NOT EXPLICITLY RECOGNIZED AS A CONDITION OF VALIDITY AND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY OF THE POLITICAL ORDER.
981	THE PAPER IDENTIFIES THE DIFFERENT ROLES PLAYED BY THE BRAZILIAN SUPREME FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE 1988 CONSTITUTION, ADOPTED AFTER 21 YEARS UNDER AUTHORITARIAN RULE. THE AIM IS TO SHIFT THE FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION REGARDING THE COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN DIFFICULTY, WHICH INSISTS ON THE ILLEGITIMACY OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, TO THE DIFFICULTY OF BEING COUNTER-MAJORITARIAN, EXAMINING THE INSTITUTIONAL OBSTACLES AND LIMITATIONS ATTENDANT UPON JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
982	THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES ON TWO TRENDS EMERGING THROUGH THE EUROZONE CRISIS, BOTH OF WHICH DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF DEMOCRACY IN THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES. FIRSTLY, THE CRISIS HAS LED TO AN INCREASED RELIANCE ON NON-MAJORITARIAN INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE ECB, AT THE EXPENSE OF DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY. SECONDLY, THE CRISIS HAS LED TO A NEW EMPHASIS ON COERCIVE ENFORCEMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE VOLUNTARY COOPERATION THAT PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERISED (AND SUSTAINED) THE EU AS A COMMUNITY OF LAW. THUS, THE ECB'S (OVER-)EMPOWERMENT IS A SYNECDOCHE OF A WIDER PROBLEM: THE EU'S TENDENCY TO RESORT TO TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE POLITICAL CONTESTATION. IN THE ABSENCE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEMOCRATIC CONTESTATION, EU EMERGENCY GOVERNANCE - INTEGRATION THROUGH CRISIS - OSCILLATES BETWEEN MOMENTS OF HEIGHTENED POLITICISATION, IN WHICH AD HOC DECISIONS ARE JUSTIFIED AS NECESSARY, AND THE (SOMETIMES COERCIVE) APPEAL TO THE DEPOLITICISED RULE OF RULES.
983	THE PAPER IS FOCUSED ON THE CONCEPTION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY AS ONE OF THE VALUABLE PRODUCTS OF ALEXY'S SYSTEMATIC LEGAL PHILOSOPHY. THE KEY CONCEPT USED TO EXPLORE THIS BROAD THEORETICAL PRODUCT OF ALEXY'S PHILOSOPHY IS THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF REASON AS A TOOL FOR THE RECONCILIATION OF THE IDEAL OR CRITICAL DIMENSION OF LAW WITH THE FACTUAL OR REAL DIMENSION OF IT. THE CONCEPT OF THE INSTITUTIONALISATION OF REASON FINDS FULL ARTICULATION IN SEVERAL FEATURES OF ALEXY'S LEGAL THEORY. IN PARTICULAR, DISCURSIVE CONSTITUTIONALISM IN ITS POLITICAL FORM EMERGES FROM THE COMPLEX INTERCONNECTIONS AMONG ALL THESE ELEMENTS. INDEED, THEY CONVERGE TO FORM THE EXISTENTIAL CORE OF A LEGAL WORLD INHABITED BY HUMAN BEINGS CONCEIVED AS AUTONOMOUS SUBJECTS IN THE KANTIAN SENSE. THIS IS THE STRONG PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION THAT SUSTAINS THE SUBSTANTIVE CONCEPTION OF THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY THAT WE FIND IN ALEXY'S PHILOSOPHY.
984	THE ARTICLE DEALS WITH UNFORTUNATELY VERY FREQUENT LACK OF CULTURE OF RULE OF LAW, ESPECIALLY PRESENT IN NEW DEMOCRACIES. AL THE MORE SO BECAUSE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED POLITICIANS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE IN POWER, DO NOT SHOW RESPECT FOR THE RULE. CONSEQUENTLY, NEW DEMOCRACIES SLOWLY ERODE TO AUTOCRATIC - OR AT LEAST - A HYBRID MODEL, WHERE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY UNDEMOCRATIC PRACTICE. THE AUTHOR, FIRST, SEEKS TO CLARIFY THE CONCEPT OF "DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW", WHOSE INDISPENSABLE ELEMENTS ARE CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY OF POWER, AND THE PROTECTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC ORDER. SECOND, HE SHOWS METHODS USED BY POLITICIANS IN YOUNG DEMOCRACIES TO THROTTLE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL MECHANISMS OF DEMOCRATIC BALANCE OF POWERS. THIRDLY, HE CALLS FOR AVOIDING A SITUATION IN WHICH THE RULING MAJORITY CAN AFFECT THE SELECTION OF THE BODIES CONSTITUTING BOTH MECHANISMS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE RULER. FOURTH, HE URGES THE JUDICIARY, ESPECIALLY THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT, TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE INTERPRETATION OF "THE DEMOCRATIC RULE OF LAW," PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROTECTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AND, THEREFORE, FIRST OF ALL ENSURE THAT THE CONDITIONS OF COMPETITIVE ELECTORAL PROCESSES, THAT IS, EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RULING MAJORITY AND THE OPPOSITION. THIS REQUIRES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE USE OF STATE RESOURCES BY THOSE IN POWER TO ENSURE THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OPPOSITION.
985	THE PHRASE CORPORATE TYRANNY MIGHT SEEM TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN EMPTY RHETORIC, A MUSCULAR SLOGAN WITH A PLAUSIBLE RING, BUT ONE LACKING PRINCIPLED ROOTS IN THE GREAT TRADITION OF POLITICAL LANGUAGE WHICH IT ECHOES. IN THIS ARTICLE, I AIM TO SHOW THAT, ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS INDEED MEANINGFUL TO APPLY THE TERM TYRANNY IN CONNECTION WITH CONTEMPORARY CORPORATE POWERMEANINGFUL, THAT IS, ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA GOVERNING THE USE OF THAT TERM WITHIN THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT TRADITION'S RULE OF LAW DISCOURSE. I ALSO AIM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT, ACCORDING TO TRADITIONAL CRITERIA, CERTAIN TERMS USED TO LAMENT THE HARMS OCCASIONED BY MANIPULATIVE STATE POWERNAMELY, ARBITRARINESS, SLAVISHNESS AND CORRUPTIONMIGHT PLAUSIBLY BE EMPLOYED AGAINST THE LARGE BUSINESS CORPORATION. THE IMPLICATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT. IF THE PRESENT CONSTITUTION OF CORPORATE POWER WERE SHOWN TO BE HOSPITABLE TO THOSE ILLS, THEN THE LEGITIMACY OF CORPORATE POWER WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION ON DISTINCTIVE RULE OF LAW GROUNDS. THE NOTION THAT ECONOMIC POWER IS A LIMITED GOVERNMENT PROBLEM WAS A CENTRAL AND RECURRENT THEME IN PUBLIC DEBATES IN THE UNITED STATES FROM THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. SINCE THEN, HOWEVER, THE NOTION OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE LIMITATION OF STATE, RATHER THAN PRIVATE, POWER; INDEED, LIMITED GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME A BYWORD FOR THE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY THAT PROFESSES A BELIEF IN SMALL GOVERNMENTA PHILOSOPHY WHICH, IN EFFECT, SUPPORTS CORPORATE POWER. IN THE LIGHT OF THAT RECEIVED WISDOM, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE SCHOLARLY INQUIRY INTO WHETHER, AND IF SO, HOW, THE UNDERLYING MORAL COMMITMENTS OF THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT TRADITION ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH CERTAIN FORMS OF CONTEMPORARY CORPORATE POWER. WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THIS ARTICLE, THERE IS NOT THE SPACE TO DO MORE THAN DEMONSTRATE THAT FURTHER INQUIRY IN THIS AREA WOULD BE WORTHWHILE.
986	THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE REGULATORY AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORKS OF THE CHINESE PRE-TRIAL PROCESS BY IDENTIFYING THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS ONE SALIENT COMPONENT IN THIS LEGAL SCHEME. IT REVIEWS THE MAJOR DIFFICULTIES OF ADMINISTERING PRE-TRIAL JUSTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE OF LAW, AS WELL AS CORRESPONDING LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROMOTING THE RULE OF LAW AS A NORMATIVE SYSTEM IN THE OPERATION OF THE PRE-TRIAL PROCESS. THE ARTICLE PROCEEDS TO MAKE A CLAIM THAT THE IDEA OF IMPLEMENTING THE RULE OF LAW AS THE REFORMATIVE BASIS TO REGULARIZE THE PRE-TRIAL PROCESS IS MOST LIKELY UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO THE PARTY'S RESISTANCE AND THE IMMATURITY OF THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM.
987	THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CAUSED A SEVERE STRAIN ON HEALTH SYSTEMS GLOBALLY, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENTING A SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, LEGAL, POLITICAL, AND REGULATORY CHALLENGE. WHERE THE EFFICACY OF PANDEMIC LAWS ADOPTED BY GOVERNMENTS ARE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, THE URGENCY WITH WHICH ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DURING A PANDEMIC CREATES A LAW-MAKING ENVIRONMENT WHICH INCENTIVISES RAPID ACTION WITHOUT SCRUTINY AND THE USE OF POWER WITHOUT RESTRAINT. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, ADHERENCE TO THE FOUNDATIONAL VALUES OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW COME UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE IF NOT THREAT. THE DEMANDS OF EMERGENCY PROVIDE A CONVENIENT GUISE AND MEANS OF JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF POWER WHICH ONLY SERVES TO CONSOLIDATE POWER WITHIN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS AND WEAKENING OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS ON HOW THE GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS HAS AFFECTED THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW. WHILE THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE DRAWN FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE TO HIGHLIGHT COMMON TRENDS AND CONCERNS, SPECIFIC HIGHLIGHT IS GIVEN TO THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES. IT OFFERS AN OUTLOOK ON HOW TO PREPARE FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES BY BUILDING ON THE LESSONS OF THE CURRENT ONE.
988	OBJECTIVE. APPLYING EXISTING THEORIES RELATING TO INVESTMENT RISK, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW ON PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD. WE AIM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND RULE OF LAW ARE MORE ABLE TO ATTRACT PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE GREATER PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND A BETTER RISK ENVIRONMENT FOR INVESTORS. METHODS. USING TIME-SERIES DATA FOR 79 DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 1996-2005, WE EMPLOY PANEL-CORRECTED STANDARD ERRORS MULTIVARIATE REGRESSIONS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND RULE OF LAW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT. RESULTS. WE FIND THAT A ONE STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE IN OVERALL JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND RULE OF LAW RESULTS IN MORE THAN A 50 PERCENT INCREASE IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT. IN SEPARATE ANALYSES, WE SHOW THAT A ONE STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE IN SPECIFIC MEASURES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, IMPARTIAL COURTS, AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS LEADS TO INCREASES IN PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT RANGING FROM 27 PERCENT TO 184 PERCENT. CONCLUSION. JUDICIAL STRENGTH AND ADHERENCE TO THE RULE OF LAW ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD.
989	IN THE TRADITIONAL ORDER OF THE "RULE OF RITES," SOCIAL STATUS AND RELATIONSHIPS ALWAYS HELD PRIORITY POSITIONS, WHICH APPARENTLY WENT AGAINST THE REALIZATION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE; LEGALISTS THOUGHT HIGHLY OF OBJECTIVITY AND AVOIDED SUBJECTIVE RANDOMNESS, AND WERE MORE REASONABLE IN THIS REGARD. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE INTEGRATION OF RITES AND LAW IN THE HAN DYNASTY, THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF LEGALISM EMPHASIZING CONTROL OF SOCIETY AND OF THE POPULACE WAS STRENGTHENED, AND IN THE MEANWHILE, THEIR "TRUE SPIRIT" BECAME CONCEALED BEFORE LONG. THE MAIN SIGNS OF THIS ARE FOLLOWS: (1) IN THE ORDER OF THE "RULE OF RITES," THE OBJECTIVITY OF LAW WAS GRADUALLY DEVOURED BY THE SUBJECTIVITY OF HUMAN BEINGS, THUS THE TRADITION WHERE "HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS REPLACE LAW" CAME INTO BEING; (2) THE LAW, WHICH HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF EQUALITY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IN THE GUISE OF LEGALISM, NOW DEGRADED INTO A TOOL TO MAINTAIN A HIERARCHY; (3) RIGHTS WERE SEPARATED FROM DUTIES, THAT IS, SOME PEOPLE ENJOYED "RIGHTS WITHOUT DUTIES" AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED, WHILE THE REST WERE FORCED TO CARRY OUT "DUTIES WITHOUT RIGHTS." AS HISTORY HAS WARNED US, IN RULING A COUNTRY, ONE CANNOT STAKE EVEN THE LEAST BIT OF FORTUNE UPON HUMAN NATURE, AND THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE BOTTOM LINE AND CRITERION, THAT IS, COMMON STRICT OBSERVANCE OF AND RESPECT TO "RULES." THAT SHOULD BE THE GREAT VALUE OF THE LESSON THAT THE PRE-QIN LEGALISM HAS LEFT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
990	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC SERVICE AS A CONSTITUTIVE ELEMENT OF THE RULE OF LAW FUNCTION THAT IS CONTRASTED WITH THE POLICIES OF PROVISION OF THESE SERVICES UNDER THE SO-CALLED "NEOLIBERAL" CURRENT. SIMILARLY THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOLUTION GIVEN BY THE CONSTITUTION OF 1991 IS STUDIED, WHICH AIMS TO HARMONIZE THE PROVISION OF THESE IN THE CONTEXT OF MARKET ECONOMY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES OF THE RULE OF LAW. ALSO THE CONCRETE RESULTS FOR SOME HARMONIZATION PROJECT OF SOME UTILITIES WILL BE ANALYZED.
991	WHEN INTERPRETING STATUTES, COURTS PRESUME THAT PARLIAMENT INTENDED THE STATUTE TO BEAR A MEANING WHICH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY VALID. WHEN THIS PRESUMPTION IS APPLIED UNYIELDINGLY, IT CAN RESULT IN STATUTES BEING ASCRIBED MEANINGS WHICH ARE UNNATURAL, VAGUE AND CHANGEABLE. THAT CAN IMPAIR THE RULE OF LAW VALUES OF PREDICTABILITY AND CONTINUITY IN THE LAW. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT RULE OF LAW VALUES CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTIONAL PROCESS - BOTH IN GENERAL AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF READING STATUTES IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION. THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THIS THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF TWO 2012 HIGH COURT DECISIONS AND PROPOSES A SET OF INTERPRETIVE MAXIMS WHICH COURTS COULD APPLY TO TEMPER UNRESTRAINED APPLICATION OF THE PRESUMPTION THAT STATUTES SHOULD BE ASCRIBED A MEANING WHICH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY VALID.
992	WE EMBED A CRITIQUE OF THE RESPECTIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF POLICY INITIATIVES TO 'BUILD THE RULE OF LAW' WITHIN THE BROADER LITERATURE ON POLITICAL SETTLEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL STATES, THEREBY CREATING A FOUNDATION FOR AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK THAT TAKES POLITICS AND THE LEGITIMACY OF CHANGE PROCESSES SERIOUSLY. THUS FAR THE DOMINANT TERMS OF DEBATE HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THOSE ADVOCATING OR RESISTING THE REPLICATION OF LEGAL 'FORMS' (I.E., WHAT MODERN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS, STATUTES AND PROCEDURES 'LOOK LIKE', SUCH AS CONSTITUTIONS) VIA LARGE, RAPID, IMPORTED TECHNOCRATIC INTERVENTIONS, AND THOSE PUSHING INSTEAD FOR A FOCUS ON ENHANCING A PREVAILING LEGAL SYSTEM'S 'FUNCTIONALITY' (WHAT THE EXISTING SYSTEM ACTUALLY 'DOES') VIA A SERIES OF LOCAL LEVEL LEGAL EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMS OR ATTEMPTS TO REDEFINE STATE-SOCIETY RELATIONS BY ADJUSTING LEGAL CONFIGURATIONS. WE ARGUE FOR THE INCLUSION OF A THIRD DIMENSION, NAMELY ONE ENCOMPASSING PROCEDURAL LEGITIMACY AND EQUITABLE CONTESTATION AS PART OF THE CHANGE PROCESS.
993	THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES PROVIDE A PRONOUNCED CRITIQUE OF THE ATHENIAN ASSEMBLY, WHERE PUBLIC DELIBERATION AND CONTESTATION CONDITIONED DECISION-MAKING, AND MASS OPINION ACTED AS A BASIS FOR SOUND JUDGMENT. ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THE VERY PROBLEM OF POLITICAL JUDGMENT THUS ARISES FROM THE COERCION MADE POSSIBLE BY SUSTAINING THE CONDITIONS OF POLITICAL FREEDOM. THIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT WHEREAS THE ASSEMBLY WAS THE LOCUS OF PLATO'S DEMOCRATIC ANXIETIES, HE IDENTIFIED IN THE POPULAR LAW-COURTS AN ALTERNATIVE, NON-DELIBERATIVE AND NON-CONTESTATORY MEANS OF FORMING CITIZEN JUDGMENT, THROUGH THE INCULCATION OF A CIVIC PIETY PREDICATED ON A KIND OF AGNOSTIC REVERENCE FOR THE RULE OF LAW.
994	THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE CONSISTENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EU AS A GLOBAL PROMOTER OF VALUES BY FOCUSING ON THE RULE OF LAW, ONE OF THE KEY VALUES ON WHICH THE EU IS BASED AND WHICH IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO GUIDE EU'S EXTERNAL ACTION. THE PAPER FIRST OFFERS THE DIAGNOSIS THAT THE EU HAS FAILED TO PROPERLY ADDRESS A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES: (I) WHAT THE EU SEEKS TO PROMOTE UNDER THE HEADING 'RULE OF LAW', (II) HOW IT MEASURES AND MONITORS A COUNTRY'S ADHERENCE TO THIS PRINCIPLE AND (III) THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN ITS EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL POLICIES AND INSTRUMENTS. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, FOUR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE: (I) THE ADOPTION OF A GUIDANCE NOTE, (II) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRANSVERSAL MEASUREMENT AND MONITORING INSTRUMENT, (III) THE ADOPTION OF A RULE OF LAW CHECKLIST AND (IV) THE REVISION OF THE ROLE OF EU FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AGENCY, WITH THE VIEW OF TRANSFORMING IT INTO A 'COPENHAGEN COMMISSION' WITH NEW POWERS AND A BROADER GEOGRAPHICAL REMIT.
995	ROMANS 13:1-7, WHICH COMMANDS SUBJECTION TO GOVERNING AUTHORITIES, CAN BE GIVEN TOO MUCH WEIGHT IN THE MORAL ANALYSIS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THIS ARTICLE CONSIDERS ROMANS 13 IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF ROMANS AND OF THE BIBLICAL CANON TO SHOW BIBLICAL REASONS FOR PERMITTING CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TOWARD IMMIGRATION LAW. RATHER THAN VIEWING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AS UNIVERSALLY IMMORAL LAWBREAKERS, THESE BIBLICAL FACTORS COMBINED WITH ANALYSIS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF LIFE, LEGAL AMBIGUITIES ARISING FROM COMPETING JURISDICTIONS, AND OTHER SOCIO-POLITICAL FACTORS SHOW THAT IT MAY BE A PRUDENT ACTION FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TO DISOBEY IMMIGRATION LAW.
996	AFTER BEING INITIALLY DRAFTED IN 2001 BY AN EXPERT BODY-THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON INTERVENTION AND STATE SOVEREIGNTY-THE "RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT" (R2P) DOCTRINE HAS EVENTUALLY FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE 2005 UN WORLD SUMMIT OUTCOME DOCUMENT, THEREBY REPLACING A MORALLY CONTROVERSIAL DOCTRINE OF "HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION". THE PAPER AIMS, FIRST, TO POINT OUT HOW THESE TWO DOCTRINES ARE DIFFERENT ETHICAL PROJECTS. SECOND, RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS SAFER TO SAY THAT THE DOCTRINE HAS NOT BECOME A PRINCIPLE OF LAW, THIS PAPER TRIES TO SITUATE IT WITHIN THE PREVALENT VALUE OF THE INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW. IT DOES SO BY EXPLORING TWO SOMEWHAT CONTRASTING CONCEPTIONS-ONE MORE SUBSTANTIVE IN NATURE, WHICH TAKES INDIVIDUALS AS ULTIMATE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS VALUE, AND THE OTHER, MORE FORMAL IN NATURE, WHICH PUTS STATES IN THE FOREFRONT. THE R2P CASE SHOWS, HOWEVER, THAT NEITHER OF THEM CAN BE ADVANCED TO THE FULL EXTENT.
997	LEGAL STUDIES IN MAINLAND CHINA HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED ENORMOUS ATTENTION. THE RULING COMMUNIST PARTY HAS CALLED UPON SCHOLARS AND ADMINISTRATORS TO DEVELOP A KIND OF SOCIALIST LEGALITY THAT CAN ASSIST IN ADVANCING A COMMODITY ECONOMY. THE CALL HAS RECEIVED SUCH AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE IN ACADEMIC CIRCLES THAT WHAT CONSTITUTES SOCIALIST LEGALITY HAS BECOME AN ISSUE OF CONTROVERSY. THE RECENT DEBATE REGARDING THE NATURE OF SOCIALIST LAW HAS ESCALATED INTO A PHILOSOPHICAL SEARCH OF IDENTITY FOR SOCIALIST LEGALITY. PROPONENTS OF ORTHODOX VIEWS STRUGGLE TO HOLD THEIR OWN IN THESE DEBATES UNDER THE BANNER OF ''SOCIALISM WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS.'' EMERGING CHALLENGERS, IN CONTRAST, MAKE THEIR ASSERTIONS IN THE NAME OF RULE OF LAW AND A COMMODITY ECONOMY. IN ESSENCE, THE CORE OF THE DEBATE APPEARS TO BE COLLECTIVISM VERSUS INDIVIDUALISM. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS CONTENDING ARGUMENTS MADE BETWEEN 1989 AND 1992, EACH OF WHICH STRIVES TO DEFINE THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF SOCIALIST LEGALITY.
998	SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS AND OUTCOMES HAVE COME TO THE FOREFRONT OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH. WE INTRODUCE RELIGIOSITY, MEASURED AS THE SHARE FOR WHICH RELIGION IS IMPORTANT IN DAILY LIFE, TO EXPLAIN INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IN THE FORM OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE ONLY MEASURED THE IMPACT OF MEMBERSHIP SHARES OF DIFFERENT RELIGIONS, WITH MIXED RESULTS. WE FIND, IN A CROSS-COUNTRY REGRESSION ANALYSIS COMPRISING UP TO 112 COUNTRIES, THAT RELIGIOSITY IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL OUTCOME VARIABLES. THIS ONLY HOLDS IN DEMOCRACIES (NOT AUTOCRACIES), WHICH SUGGESTS THAT RELIGIOSITY AFFECTS THE WAY INSTITUTIONS WORK THROUGH THE POLITICAL PROCESS. INDIVIDUAL RELIGIONS ARE NOT RELATED TO OUR MEASURES OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY.
999	THIS GOVERNMENT WHITEPAPER DESCRIBES THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S STRUGGLES FOR DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, EQUALITY AND THE BUILDING OF A COUNTRY UNDER THE RULE OF LAW. IT FIRST PROVIDES AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORICAL COURSE OF THESE EFFORTS AND A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CHINESE LEGAL SYSTEM. THE WHITEPAPER THEN DESCRIBES SEPARATELY HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, THE MARKET ECONOMY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION, JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT OF LAW AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE, LEGAL EDUCATION, AND INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE AND COOPERATION RELATING TO THESE ISSUES.
